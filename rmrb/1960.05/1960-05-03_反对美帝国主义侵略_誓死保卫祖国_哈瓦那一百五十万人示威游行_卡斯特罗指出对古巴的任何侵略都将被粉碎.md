Xinhua News Agency, Havana, May 1st: This reporter reports: 1.5 million Cuban people held a massive "May Day" demonstration in Havana's Civic Square today, expressing their determination to defend the motherland and oppose American imperialist aggression.

The central slogan of today's International Labor Day "May Day" celebration was: Oppose American imperialist aggression, and vow to defend the motherland to the death! Huge Cuban flags fluttered everywhere on the buildings of Havana.

The rostrum was set up opposite the statue of Cuban national hero José Martí, where Prime Minister Castro, President Dorticós, and other government and trade union leaders reviewed the parade. Beside the rostrum stood a statue of working people holding weapons and tools, symbolizing the Cuban people's determination to defend and advance the revolution.

Civic Square and all the nearby streets were filled with demonstrators. Slogans such as "Long live the revolution!" and "Defend sovereignty at all costs!" resounded through the sky.

The demonstration began at ten o'clock this morning. At the head of the parade was a column of young Cuban women, dressed in red, blue, and white, symbolizing the Cuban flag. Behind them were teams of young people, marching proudly with bayoneted rifles, singing the songs of the "26th of July Movement." Also participating in today's demonstration were Cuban army and navy units, tanks, armored vehicles, anti-aircraft guns, and various cannons captured from Batista's dictatorial army, passing through Civic Square. The young Cuban armed forces participating in today's demonstration showed that they were a well-trained force capable of withstanding any arduous battle.

Also participating in the demonstration were militia teams of workers, peasants, and students, including militia from the Sierra Maestra, the old base area of the Cuban guerrilla war. The great international solidarity between Cuba and the people of Latin America and other countries of the world was a prominent feature of today's "May Day" demonstration. Guests from across the Americas and other countries of the world participated in the "May Day" celebration, including representatives from the World Federation of Trade Unions on the rostrum, Chilean People's Action Front President Allende, and members of the Chinese Trade Union and Chinese Youth Delegation. Representatives from twenty Latin American countries, holding their national flags high, joined the Cuban people in the parade, raising flags that read "The Cuban Revolution is the revolution of all of Latin America" and "Down with American imperialism," shouting slogans such as "Long live Latin American solidarity!" and "Sierra Maestra is the free territory of Cuba, and Cuba is today the free territory of Latin America." A "Latin American militia" battalion also participated in the demonstration, carrying large banners reading "Down with American imperialism" as they passed through Civic Square.

Prime Minister Castro delivered a speech at a grand rally in Havana tonight attended by more than 1.5 million people, reiterating that the Cuban people will defend the revolution at all costs. Castro's speech was warmly cheered by more than 1.5 million people, who shouted "Vow to defend the motherland to the death," and waved Cuban flags, scarves, machetes, and palm hats on the tips of their guns for several minutes.

Castro said that the Cuban revolutionary government and people are wholeheartedly committed to a great cause, and those who fight to realize such a cause cannot be provocateurs. He emphasized that the provocateurs are the international big capital groups and other millionaire groups who are struggling desperately, unwilling to lose their privileges, and unwilling to let the people of all countries live in peace.

In his speech, Castro forcefully refuted the enemy's lie that there is no democracy in Cuba. He said that the revolutionary government is working to defend the interests of the majority of the people. He emphasized that Cuban democracy is the return of land illegally seized by foreign companies to the peasants, the guarantee of workers' right to work, the provision of educational opportunities for the children of poor workers and peasants, the defense of the rights of Cuban blacks who were previously discriminated against at work, the achievement of equal status for women, and the elimination of the old army of the people's enemies, replaced by a people's revolutionary army.

He emphasized that handing weapons to workers, peasants, students, women, blacks, and the poor is proof of the revolutionary government's democratic nature, something that false democracy cannot do. He went on to say that it is enough to think about what would happen if rifles were handed to the black people in the South of the United States, who are often subjected to lynching.

In response to provocations about holding elections in Cuba, Castro pointed out that a revolution like Cuba's could not come to power without the support of the people. He said that the Cuban people seized power with blood and the sacrifice of 20,000 Cubans in the struggle against a powerful foreign-trained and armed professional army. He said that the Cuban people broke the chains that enslaved them, thereby forever destroying privilege, irrationality, and evil.

Castro said that vowing to defend the motherland to the death means living and sacrificing for a better world. This is the determination and will of the Cuban people. After exposing that Cuba's enemies are being organized at the American base in Caimanera in order to carry out a so-called "spontaneous invasion," he pointed out that the Cuban people will never allow the United States to manufacture an incident similar to the "Maine" warship explosion in 1898 when it opened fire on Spain, as an excuse to invade Cuba. He said that any aggression against Cuba will be crushed, not only because of the opposition of the Cuban people, but also because such an invasion will be opposed by the people of Latin America and all countries of the world.

Castro called on the Cuban people to be vigilant at all times. He emphasized that the most important thing is that the people must know that they cannot be divided in the face of aggression. He asked people to be prepared for self-sacrifice and to fight to the end. He said that if the prime minister is lost, then Raúl Castro will take over the position. If both brothers are gone, then the president will convene a cabinet meeting to appoint a successor.

Castro said that the indomitable Cuban people will respond to the confidence and support of the people of Latin America and all countries of the world in the Cuban revolution with practical actions. He finally called on all soldiers, militiamen, peasants, workers, and students to raise their rifles, flags, and machetes together to swear: Vow to defend the motherland to the death!

Immediately, 1.5 million people let out a powerful oath that shook the mountains and rivers. Revolutionary Army soldiers and militiamen raised their forest-like dense rifles and machetes, waving Cuban flags, to show their support for the oath.

    反对美帝国主义侵略　誓死保卫祖国
    哈瓦那一百五十万人示威游行
    卡斯特罗指出对古巴的任何侵略都将被粉碎
    新华社哈瓦那1日电　本社记者报道：一百五十万古巴人民今天在古巴首都的西维卡广场举行声势浩大的“五一”示威游行，表示他们保卫祖国和反对美帝国主义侵略的决心。
    今天举行的“五一”国际劳动节的中心口号是：反对美帝国主义侵略，誓死保卫祖国！在哈瓦那的建筑物上到处是迎风招展的巨大的古巴国旗。
    主席台设在古巴民族英雄何塞·马蒂的铸像的对面，在那里卡斯特罗总理、多尔蒂科斯总统以及其他政府和工会领导人检阅了游行队伍。在主席台的旁边竖着一座手持武器和工具的劳动人民的雕像，象征古巴人民具有保卫革命和推进革命决心。
    在西维卡广场及其附近的所有街道上，都是参加游行示威的人流。“革命万岁！”和“不惜任何代价地保卫主权！”等口号响彻云霄。
    示威游行是在今天上午十点钟开始的。走在游行队伍最前面的是古巴青年妇女的行列，她们穿着红、蓝和白色的象征着古巴国旗的盛装。在她们后面的是一队队的青年们，他们手持上了刺刀的步枪，高唱着“七月二十六日运动”的歌曲雄赳赳地行进。参加今天的示威游行的还有古巴的陆军和海军部队，过去从巴蒂斯塔独裁军队那里缴获来的坦克、装甲车、高射炮和各种大炮??地通过西维卡广场。参加今天的示威游行的年轻的古巴武装部队显示出它是一支受过良好的训练和经受得起任何艰苦战斗的部队。
    参加示威游行的还有工人、农民和学生的民兵队伍，他们中有来自古巴游击战争老根据地马埃斯特腊山区的民兵。古巴同拉丁美洲和世界其他各国人民之间的国际大团结是今天举行的“五一”示威游行的一个显著的特点。参加“五一”庆祝的有来自整个美洲大陆和世界其他国家的贵宾，其中包括在主席台上的世界工会联合会的代表、智利人民行动阵线主席阿伦德、中国工会和中国青年代表团的成员。来自拉丁美洲二十个国家的代表们高举着他们的国旗和古巴人民一起参加了游行，他们举起写着“古巴革命就是整个拉丁美洲的革命”和“打倒美帝国主义”的旗帜，高喊着“拉丁美洲团结万岁！”和“马埃斯特腊是古巴的自由领土，古巴是今天拉丁美洲的自由领土”的口号。一支“拉丁美洲民兵”大队也参加示威游行，他们拿着“打倒美帝国主义”的大幅标语牌经过西维卡广场。
    卡斯特罗总理今天晚上在哈瓦那的一百五十多万人参加的盛大集会上发表演说，重申古巴人民将不惜一切代价，保卫革命。卡斯特罗的讲话受到一百五十多万人的热烈欢呼，他们高呼“誓死保卫祖国”，并且挥动着古巴国旗，领巾，砍刀，和顶在枪尖上的棕榈帽达数分钟之久。
    卡斯特罗说，古巴革命政府和人民一心一意致力于巨大的事业，为了实现这样的事业而斗争的人们不可能是挑衅者。他强调说，挑衅者是国际大资本集团和其他的百万富翁集团，他们竭力挣扎，不愿失去特权，不甘心让各国人民和平地生活。
    卡斯特罗在讲话中有力地驳斥了敌人所谓在古巴没有民主的谎言。他说，革命政府是为了保卫大多数人民的利益而工作的。他强调指出，古巴的民主就是把从前为外国公司非法扣下的土地交给了农民，保证了工人工作的权利，使贫苦的工农子弟有就学的机会，保卫了过去在工作中受到歧视的古巴黑人的权利，为妇女取得平等的地位，并且消灭了人民敌人的旧军队，而代之以一支人民的起义军。
    他强调指出，把武器交给工人、农民、学生、妇女、黑人和贫苦的人们是革命政府民主性质的证明，虚假的民主不可能做到这点。他接着说，只要想一想假如在美国把步枪交给经常受到私刑残害的南方黑人的话会发生什么样的事情就够了。
    卡斯特罗在回答关于要古巴举行选举的挑衅时指出，像古巴这样的革命不可能没有人民的支持而能上台执政的。他说，古巴人民是在反对一个强大的外国所训练和武装起来的职业军的斗争中，用鲜血和二万古巴人的牺牲取得政权的。他说，古巴人民挣断了奴役它们的锁链，从而永远摧毁了特权、不合理现象和罪恶。
    卡斯特罗说，誓死保卫祖国就是为了美好的世界而生活和牺牲。这是古巴人民的决心和意志。他在揭露古巴的敌人正在美国基地卡伊马内拉被组织起来，以便进行所谓“自发的入侵”以后指出，古巴人民绝不允许美国制造类似1898年同西班牙开仗时的“缅因号”轮船爆炸事件，作为入侵古巴的借口。他说，反对古巴的任何侵略都将被粉碎，这不仅是由于古巴人民的反对，而且也是由于这种入侵将遭到拉丁美洲和全世界各国人民的反对。
    卡斯特罗号召古巴人民时刻保持警惕。他强调指出，最主要的是，人民要知道在面临侵略时不能分裂。他要求人们作好自我牺牲和战斗到底的精神准备。他说，假如失去了总理的话，那么劳尔·卡斯特罗将接替这个职位。假如兄弟两人全不在了的话，那么总统将召集内阁会议任命继任者。
    卡斯特罗表示，不屈不挠的古巴人民将以实际行动来回答拉丁美洲和世界各国人民对古巴革命的信心和支持。他最后号召全体士兵、民兵、农民、工人、学生高举他们的步枪、旗帜和砍刀共同宣誓：誓死保卫祖国！
    一百五十万人立即发出了震动山河的强大的宣誓声，起义军战士和民兵高举起他们森林般密集的步枪和砍刀，挥动着古巴国旗，表示支持这个誓言。
