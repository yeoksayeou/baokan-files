    The Sun of Japan (and one other poem)
    Li Ying

    Where is the sun of Japan?
    Ask Nobusuke Kishi, where is the sun?
    The sun of Japan is not the sun,
    Daytime is also night,
    Dark and damp.
    It was Kishi Nobusuke who sold it,
    He sold it,
    Locked into prison by the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty,"
    Hooked on the anchor by the U.S. fleet,
    Sunk to the bottom of the sea,
    Locked into the money box like a gold coin by Wall Street bosses.
    Will it just die like this and never rise again?
    Will Japan just lose its white clouds and land?
    No, a Japanese worker said it well:
    "No! Our sun is not one, but one hundred million!
    Our one hundred million suns are rising at the same time,
    They are red and big like magnificent poems;
    They rise and never set,
    They rise and shine on the earth!
    "It is the heart of our one hundred million Japanese people fighting,
    Not afraid of being shot, not afraid of artillery fire;
    Resolutely overthrow Kishi Nobusuke, drive away the American devils,
    Return our freedom! Return our democracy! Return our rights!"

    At the foot of Mount Fuji...
    What secrets are buried at the foot of Mount Fuji?
    Fresh blood? Skeletons? Ruins?
    The glint of tears under a mother's white hair?
    The crying of a baby under the American bayonet?
    No, there is still hot magma,
    There are still sky-high torches;
    The roaring storm will sweep away the American soldiers,
    Millions of fists have raised the blood-stained flag...

    日本的太阳（外一首）
    李瑛日本的太阳在哪里？问岸信介，太阳在哪里？日本的太阳不是太阳，白天也是黑夜，阴暗又潮湿。是岸信介出卖了它，他出卖了它，被“日美安全条约”锁进了监狱，被美军舰队钩在铁锚上，沉进海底，被华尔街老板锁进钱柜像枚金币。难道它就这样死去不再升起？难道日本就这样失去了白云和大地？不，一个日本工人说得好：“不！我们的太阳不是一个，而是一亿！“我们的一亿个太阳正同时上升，它们又红又大像壮丽的诗；它们升起来就永不落山，它们升起来光照大地！“它就是我们一亿日本人民斗争的心，不怕枪杀，不怕炮击；坚决打倒岸信介，赶走美国鬼，还我们自由！还我们民主！还我们权利！”
    富士山下…………富士山下埋着什么秘密？鲜血？骸骨？废墟？母亲白发下眼泪的闪光？美国刺刀尖下婴儿的哭啼？不，还有炽热的岩浆，还有烛天的火炬；咆哮的风暴要卷走美国兵，千百万只拳头举起了滴血的旗……
