    Everyone is Happy
    The Experience of the Party Committee of Xinbao People's Commune, Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, in Leading the Fight Against Drought
    Our Correspondent
    The Party Committee of Xinbao People's Commune in Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, Gansu Province, relied on the masses, conducted investigations and research, and effectively implemented the mass line working method of "from the masses, to the masses" during the drought resistance and spring sowing campaign. This resulted in outstanding achievements in the commune's drought resistance and spring sowing work. Within five months, the commune developed more than 15,000 mu of irrigated land, a fivefold increase over the total area of irrigated land in the past; and more than 20,000 mu of sand-covered land, a one and a half times increase over the past. Of this year's 170,000 mu of grain sown area, 155,000 mu can be guaranteed for planting and emergence, and the remaining land can be planted well and emerge well by adopting methods of carrying water to create moisture and land processing. The victory in drought resistance and sowing has laid a solid foundation for the drought-stricken mountain people's commune to strive for a bumper harvest this year.
    In leading this drought resistance and spring sowing campaign, the Party Committee of Xinbao People's Commune resolutely implemented the Party's mass line working method, relying on the masses, proceeding from the actual local conditions, analyzing specific things specifically, and adopting different measures in different regions to conscientiously implement the Party's policies in light of local conditions, thereby fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members and achieving twice the result with half the effort.
    Last winter, based on the instructions of the higher-level Party committee on preventing and resisting drought, the Xinbao Commune Party Committee put forward the action slogan of "Dig when you see water, cover when you see sand, great drought, great production increase, and guaranteed harvest without rain." However, the labor force put into water conservancy construction by various production teams was small and lacked enthusiasm. The responsible comrades of the commune party committee went to each team to find the reasons and solicit opinions from the masses. The opinions of the masses showed that great drought and great production increase, and guaranteed harvest without rain, were their urgent wishes, but "dig when you see water, cover when you see sand" was not feasible, because irrigated land and shady and wet land did not need to be covered with sand. Some old farmers said, "Drought resistance should also be treated symptomatically, and cannot be done according to one standard!" According to the opinions of the masses, the commune party committee held an enlarged meeting of the party committee, and made a comprehensive analysis of the natural characteristics of the Xinbao area: Xinbao is high in the south and low in the north, and is basically divided into three types of areas: the northern part accounts for 70% of the total area of the commune, which is a dry area; the middle 20% is a water-deficient area; and the southern 10% is a shady and wet area. The shady and wet area is close to the mountains, has forests, and has abundant water sources; the middle area is afraid of drought and cold; the northern area has neither surface water nor little rainfall. Therefore, everyone believes that the focus of drought resistance and production is the dry area. Based on this conclusion, the responsible comrades of the commune party committee went to various places to study with the masses. The masses said: "This understanding is very real, but it is not complete." "Not only should we understand the nature of the sky, but also the nature of the land." They said: "The sky has sunshine, clouds, wind, and rain, and the land has yin mountains and yang mountains. We need to know which soil is suitable for planting what!" Based on the opinions of the masses again, the commune party committee further analyzed the three types of areas in the commune, and found that the differences between these three types of areas are very large: snow melts in the shady and wet areas every April, and frost comes in July, making it suitable for planting cold-resistant crops such as highland barley, barley, and oats; in the middle area, snow melts in March and frost comes in August, making it suitable for planting wheat and beans; and in the dry area, it is suitable for planting drought-resistant crops such as wheat and millet.
    After such specific research, the commune party committee implemented the Party's water conservancy policy according to the different characteristics of the region, and put forward the slogan of "focusing on the three fields" (irrigated fields, sandy fields, and shady and wet fields) and "planting crops according to local conditions." It determined that the shady and wet areas should focus on shady and wet fields and plant more highland barley, barley, and oats; the middle areas should intercept and divert underground water, control surface water, and increase the application of drought-resistant and cold-resistant fertilizers to plant more wheat and beans; and the dry areas should dig more underground water and cover a large amount of sandy fields to plant more wheat and millet. After this slogan was put forward, it was immediately warmly supported by the broad masses, and all regions started drought resistance production according to their different characteristics.
    After the vigorous drought resistance production campaign was launched, the commune party committee put forward the following suggestions based on the opinions of the masses: "When digging water, first look at the 'terrain', then calculate the 'benefits', and then start construction"; "Press the sand first when there is moisture, and carry water to plant in dry beaches." This made the leadership work more in-depth and realistic, making drought resistance production not only vigorous, but also solid.
    Throughout the entire progress of the drought resistance campaign, the Xinbao Commune Party Committee consistently implemented this leadership method. They put forward different goals for different periods. For example, once the drought resistance campaign was launched, they put forward "One idea per person, eliminate drought land," mobilizing the masses to offer suggestions and ideas. After the water was dug out, they put forward "Love water as you love grain, one bowl of water, one bowl of oil, drip by drip into the ground." In irrigation, they put forward "Economical use of water, scientific irrigation, draw water from high places and flood the slopes; do not inject water into low-lying areas, and every drop of water must return to farmland," advocating saving water and expanding the irrigated area. When some spring snow fell and some people had a slack mood towards drought resistance, they put forward the slogan "If drought is not eliminated for a day, we will not stop fighting for a day." This kind of vivid and lively action slogan that adapts to local conditions and circumstances leads and inspires the masses to move forward with clear goals and full enthusiasm.
    In addition to putting forward specific policies and goals, the Xinbao Commune Party Committee also focused on various specific measures. The commune and production teams universally held forums with commune members to learn from the masses and find treasures, and then concentrated these experiences, researched and sorted them out by the commune leadership, and then universally promoted them. The drought resistance measures promoted by the Xinbao Commune include:
    1. According to the policy of "combining storage, diversion and lifting, combining large, medium and small, with small as the foundation and large as the backbone," the commune party committee planned water conservancy projects in light of local conditions. The Heimaquan River project undertaken by the commune is 20 li long. After opening mountains and digging canals, the river water that used to flow away in vain was diverted over the mountains and flowed to the most arid Gancheng Brigade. Each production team dug springs and agricultural canals in nearby gullies, and built pools and dams to block and store the trickle, and then stored small amounts and released large amounts. In the most arid areas, groundwater was excavated on a large scale, digging series of wells, opening open ditches, drilling single wells, or diverting water to irrigate fields by gravity, or lifting water with waterwheels to irrigate land.
    2. Covering sandy land on a large scale. The masses said, "Three stones and a bowl of water, the sun shines on the stones and the rain seeps into the soil, covering with sand is very useful, and can grow grain and melons." The commune organized the labor force of major brigades to cover more than 20,000 mu of sandy land in the Zhongchuan Beach, where sand is near and the land is flat.
    3. Processing shady and wet fields. The masses said, "Shady and wet fields are treasure eggs, not afraid of sunshine and drought." This year, all teams universally processed and cultivated the shady and wet fields early, so that this part of the land has good moisture and sufficient fertilizer.
    4. Seize the moisture and plant early. The masses said, "Planting early for a while, the wheat is several inches taller, planting early for a day, harvesting early for ten days." This year, the Xinbao Commune broke the routine and universally implemented ice-scar planting for summer crops, advancing the sowing season by one month. It also solved the difficulties in coordinating human and animal power in the past, when summer and autumn crops were sown continuously.
    5. Differentiate land, adjust crops, and plant according to local conditions. According to the experience of old farmers, each production team appropriately adjusted crops according to the nature of the soil, moisture conditions, and the degree of drought resistance and cold resistance. For example, dry Yangwa land is fertilized with drought-resistant fertilizers and planted with drought-resistant crops; relatively humid Yinwa land is fertilized with heat-generating fertilizers and planted with other crops.
    6. For land with insufficient soil moisture, adopt methods such as carrying ice, carrying water, spot planting, and sowing with water rakes, so that the seeds are connected to the bottom moisture, which is conducive to rooting and germination. The commune also stored enough seeds of buckwheat, millet, millet and other small-day crops and vegetable seeds with a spirit of preparedness.
    Through the solid and meticulous drought resistance and spring sowing campaign, great achievements have been made. The current production outlook of Xinbao People's Commune is full of enthusiasm, the masses are in high spirits and full of confidence; the cadres have not only completed their tasks but also explored good leadership methods, and have won the love of the masses, and they are more energetic, so the leaders, cadres and commune members are all happy.

    皆大欢喜
    天祝藏族自治县新堡公社党委领导抗旱的经验
    本报记者
    甘肃省天祝藏族自治县新堡人民公社党委，在抗旱春播运动中，依靠群众，调查研究，很好地执行了从群众中来，到群众中去这一群众路线的工作方法，使全社的抗旱春播工作获得了优异的成绩。在五个月内，全社发展水地一万五千多亩，比过去的水地总面积增加五倍；铺砂田两万多亩，比过去增加一倍半。在今年的十七万亩粮食播种面积中，有十五万五千亩能保种保出，其余的地也能采取抬水造墒和土地加工的办法，种好出好。抗旱播种的胜利，为这个干旱的山区人民公社争取今年的大丰收，奠定了稳固基础。
    中共新堡人民公社委员会在领导这次抗旱春播运动中，坚决贯彻了党的群众路线工作方法，依靠群众，从当地实际情况出发，对具体事物具体分析；在不同地区采取不同的措施，因地制宜地认真贯彻党的方针政策，从而充分调动了广大社员群众的积极性，做到事半功倍。
    去冬，新堡公社党委根据上级党委防旱抗旱的指示，提出了“见水就挖，见砂就压，大旱大增产，无雨保丰收”的行动口号。但各生产队投入兴修水利的劳力很少，劲头不足。公社党委负责同志就分头到各队去找寻原因，征询群众意见。群众的意见表明，大旱大增产，无雨保丰收，是他们的迫切愿望，然而“见水就挖，见砂就压”是行不通的，因为水地、阴湿地就不需要压砂田。有的老农说：“抗旱也要对症下药，不能按一个尺子办事！”公社党委根据群众意见，召开了党委扩大会议，把新堡地区自然特点做了一次全面分析：新堡地势南高北低，基本上分为三类地区：北部占全社面积的70％，是干旱地区；中间20％是缺水地区；南部10％是阴湿地区。阴湿地区靠近大山，有森林，水源旺；中间地区怕旱又怕寒；北部地区既无地面水，雨水也稀少。因此大家认为，抗旱生产的重点是干旱地区。根据这个结论，公社党委负责同志，又分头到各地去和群众研究。群众说：“这个底摸得倒实在，但还不全。”“不光要摸透天性，还要摸透地性。”他们说：“天有阴晴风雨，地有阴山阳山，那里土性该种啥，也得有个谱！”公社党委再次根据群众意见，把全社三类地区又进一步作了分析，发现这三类地区差别性很大：阴湿地区每年4月雪化，7月来霜，宜种青稞、大麦、燕麦等耐寒作物；中间地带，3月雪消，8月来霜，宜种植麦子、豆类；干旱地区宜种耐旱作物麦子、糜谷。
    经过这样具体研究后，公社党委根据地区不同特点贯彻党的水利方针，提出因地制宜“抓三田”（水田、砂田、阴湿田）和“因地制宜种庄稼”的口号，确定阴湿地区大抓阴湿田，多种青稞、大麦、燕麦；中间地区截引地下水，控制地面水，增施抗旱、耐寒肥料，多种麦子、豆类；干旱地区大挖地下水，大量铺砂田，多种麦子、糜谷。这个口号提出后，立刻得到广大群众的热烈拥护，各个地区都按照不同的特点，大搞起抗旱生产来了。
    在轰轰烈烈的抗旱生产运动开展起来以后，公社党委又根据群众的意见提出：挖水要先看“地形”，后算“效益”，再施工；“有墒抢先压砂，干滩抬水点种”。这就使领导工作步步深入，切合实际，使抗旱生产不仅搞得轰轰烈烈，而且扎扎实实。
    在抗旱运动的整个进展中，新堡公社党委始终贯彻了这种领导方法。他们根据不同时期，提出不同内容的奋斗目标。如抗旱运动一经掀起，提出“一人一条计，消灭干旱地”，发动群众献计献策。当水挖出来后，提出“爱水如爱粮，一碗水、一碗油，点滴浇在地里头”。在灌溉中提出“经济用水科学灌，高处引水坡里漫；凹地不注水一点，滴水也要归农田”，提倡节约用水，扩大灌溉面积。当降了些春雪，有些人对抗旱有松劲情绪的时候，又提出了“干旱一日不消灭，我们一日不收兵”的口号。这种因时因地制宜、生动活泼的行动口号，领导和鼓舞着群众目标明确、情绪饱满地前进。
    新堡公社党委除提出具体方针和奋斗目标以外，还大抓各种具体措施。公社和生产队都普遍召开社员座谈会，在群众中取经找宝，然后把这些经验集中起来，经公社领导上研究整理后，又普遍推广。新堡公社推广的抗旱措施有：
    一、公社党委根据“蓄引提并举，大中小结合，小型为基础，大型为骨干”的方针，因地制宜地规划了水利工程。公社兴办的黑马圈河工程，全长二十里，经过开山挖渠，把过去白白流走的河水，引过高山，改道流向最干旱的干城大队。各生产队都在附近的沟岔掏泉、挖农毛渠，把涓涓细流，筑池修坝拦蓄起来，然后小蓄大放。在最干旱的地带，大规模地挖掘地下水，挖串井、开明沟、打单井，或引水自流灌田，或用水车提水浇地。
    二、大铺砂田。群众说：“三颗石头一碗水，日晒石头雨渗土，压砂用处大，能种粮食能种瓜”。公社组织各大队劳动力，在砂源近、地平的中川滩，铺砂田两万多亩。
    三、加工阴湿田。群众说：“阴湿田是宝贝蛋，不怕日晒天气旱”。各队今年对阴湿田普遍提早加工打?，使这一部分土地，墒好肥足。
    四、抢墒早种。群众说：“早种一阵，麦高几寸，早种一日，早收十日。”今年新堡公社大破常规，对夏田作物普遍实行冰槎下种，使播种季节提前了一个月。并解决了过去夏秋作物接连播种，以致人畜力难以得心应手调配的困难。
    五、区别土地，调整作物，因地种植。各生产队根据老农经验，对农作物按土性、墒情和抗旱耐寒的程度，适当作了调整。如阳洼地干旱，施耐旱的肥料，种耐旱作物；阴洼地较潮湿，施热性肥料，种其他作物。
    六、对地墒不足的土地，采取背冰、抬水、点种、用水耧播种等办法，使种子接上底墒，便于生根发芽。公社并以有备无患的精神，储备了足够的荞、糜、谷子等小日月庄稼种子和蔬菜种子，以防万一。
    通过扎实、细致的抗旱春播运动获得了重大成就，新堡人民公社当前的生产面貌热气腾腾，群众情绪高涨，信心充沛；干部既完成了任务又摸索到了良好领导方法，并获得群众的爱戴，劲头更足，因而领导、干部和社员群众三方面皆大欢喜。
