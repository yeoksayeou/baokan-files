Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 8th: The Italian newspaper "Unità" yesterday published an interview with Abbas, Premier of the Algerian Provisional Government, by the newspaper's special correspondent in Tunis. He said that the Algerian people will continue to fight until colonial rule ends and Algeria's independence is recognized.

Abbas said: "In the view of the Algerian government, there is no solution other than to take up arms and wage a protracted war." Abbas told the "Unità" reporter that de Gaulle wants to impose a military solution. I believe that after five years of war, such a solution is inconceivable. The National Liberation Army will continue to fight until the political issues raised by its struggle are given a reasonable and normal solution: that is, to end colonial rule and recognize the Algerian people's rights to freedom and independence.

The Algerian government leader strongly condemned the support given to France by Western countries, especially the United States. He said: "France is using divisions in Algeria that have been agreed upon (to be transferred) by NATO. It is no secret to anyone that it is due to American equipment and, in particular, American financial aid, that the colonial war of conquest against our people can continue, and that the war threatens to expand to the whole of North Africa. In the diplomatic field, for four years, the Western world has given moral support to this unjust war in the United Nations. We will never stop exposing this double collusion. We will tirelessly remind the people of Western countries, asking them not to assume the obligations borne by their governments, until these people stand with us against the attitude of their leaders."

In answering a question from the reporter about the attitude of the Algerian government towards Eastern countries, that is, the countries of the socialist camp, Abbas said, "For people like us who are fighting against colonial rule, the concept of East and West is a secondary issue: there is only one side that is friendly, that condemns the aggression we are suffering; and the other side is the imperialist governments that help the French colonialists."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 8th: According to a broadcast tonight by the "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station, the Algerian Provisional Government's Ministry of Information issued a statement saying that the massacre by French troops in Algeria fifteen years ago taught the Algerians a lesson, making them understand that force is the most powerful weapon to fight against imperialism, that there is nothing to forgive imperialism for, and that they should destroy it.

The statement by the Algerian Ministry of Information was issued on the fifteenth anniversary of the event in which de Gaulle's troops barbarously massacred approximately 45,000 Algerians on May 8, 1945.

The statement said that Algerians also understand that they should not believe the Western powers allied with France who boast about their "opposition" to imperialism, which is merely to deceive and confuse public opinion.

The statement then said that the current situation in Algeria is similar to the situation fifteen years ago when de Gaulle personally carried out the May 8th massacre, but today the French army cannot destroy the heroic resistance of the Algerian people, because the Algerian people have become stronger and are fighting for their just cause. The radio station also commented on the event, saying that the massacre marked the brutality and clumsiness of French imperialism and the despicable means they used. It was also a turning point in the progress of Algeria's modern history and national independence movement, because the massacre awakened the Algerian people and led them into a decisive struggle.

    阿巴斯总理在接见记者时说
    阿尔及利亚人民决心战斗到独立
    强烈谴责美国支持法国进行殖民战争
    新华社8日讯　罗马消息：意大利“团结报”昨天刊载阿尔及利亚临时政府总理阿巴斯对这家报纸驻突尼斯特派记者的谈话。他说，阿尔及利亚人民将继续战斗，直到殖民统治结束和阿尔及利亚的独立被承认为止。
    阿巴斯说：“在阿尔及利亚政府看来，今后除了武装起来进行长期战争以外，没有其他解决办法”。阿巴斯对“团结报”记者说，戴高乐想把一种军事性质的解决办法强加于人。我认为，在五年战争以后，这样一种解决办法是不可思议的。民族解放军将继续战斗，直到有一天它进行的斗争所提出的政治问题得到合理和正常的解决办法为止：即结束殖民统治，承认阿尔及利亚人民的自由和独立权利。
    这位阿尔及利亚政府领袖强烈谴责西方国家、特别是美国给法国的支持。他说：“法国在阿尔及利亚使用了北大西洋公约组织同意（调出）的师团。对所有人来说，这一点都不是秘密，就是：由于美国的装备以及特别是美国的财政援助，对我国人民进行的殖民征服战争才得以继续，战争才有扩大到全北非的危险。在外交方面，四年来，西方世界在联合国内对这种非正义战争给予了精神上的支持。我们决不会停止揭露这种双重的勾结。我们将不懈地提醒西方各国人民，要求他们不要承担他们的政府所担负的义务，一直到这些人民同我们站在一起反对他们的领导人的态度为止”。
    阿巴斯在回答记者向他提出的关于阿尔及利亚政府对东方国家、即对社会主义阵营各国的态度时说，“对于像我们这样的为反对殖民统治而进行斗争的人民来说，东方和西方这个概念是次要问题：只有一方是友好国家，它们谴责我们所遭受到的侵略；而另一方是帝国主义政府，它们帮助法国殖民主义者”。
    据新华社开罗8日电　据“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台今晚广播，阿尔及利亚临时政府宣传部发表声明说，法国军队十五年前在阿尔及利亚的大屠杀给予阿尔及利亚人一个教训，使他们懂得，武力是同帝国主义斗争的最强有力的武器，同帝国主义没有什么可谅解的地方，应该摧毁它们。
    阿尔及利亚宣传部这项声明是为戴高乐军队在1945年5月8日野蛮屠杀大约四万五千名阿尔及利亚人的事件十五周年而发表的。
    声明说，阿尔及利亚人还懂得，不要相信法国的西方强大盟国自夸它们“反对”帝国主义的言论，这仅仅是欺骗和混淆公众视听。
    声明接着说，阿尔及利亚目前的情况同十五年前戴高乐亲自进行5月8日屠杀时的情况差不多，但是，今天的法国军队不能摧毁阿尔及利亚人民的英勇反抗，因为阿尔及利亚人民变得强大了，他们正在为他们的正义事业而斗争。电台还就这件事发表评论说，这次屠杀标志着法帝国主义的残暴、笨拙和它们所用的手段的卑鄙。这也是阿尔及利亚现代历史和民族独立运动进步的转折点，因为这次屠杀唤醒了阿尔及利亚人民，使他们进入决定性的斗争。
