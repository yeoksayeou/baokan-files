Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, May 24th: The people of Romania continued to hold mass rallies on the 24th and passed resolutions, angrily condemning US imperialism for infringing upon the Soviet Union and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit, and firmly supporting the just position of the Soviet Union. Speakers pointed out that US imperialism is the number one enemy of peace and human happiness; peace cannot be begged for; the struggle for peace is primarily a struggle against imperialism.

	More than 5,000 young workers, students, and office staff in Bucharest held a rally today. Representatives of various youth circles, who spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressed great anger at the crimes of US imperialism in infringing upon the Soviet Union and sabotaging the summit conference.

	The youth worker representative of the "August 23" factory said in his speech that US imperialism had obstructed the summit conference from the very beginning. They do not want to peacefully resolve international disputes and insist on pursuing a policy of creating international tension. He said that we warmly support the Soviet Union's position against imperialist provocations. Anghelion, a student at Bahon University, pointed out at the meeting that US imperialism's sabotage of the summit conference can only isolate itself and make people of all countries more vigilant against imperialism. Stetania, a student at Bucharest No. 15 Middle School, said that no honest person can fail to express the greatest anger at the US plane's invasion of the Soviet Union. We will not allow the imperialist policy of aggression to succeed and firmly support the Soviet Union's position in safeguarding world peace. The young poet Ian Brad also resolutely condemned the bandit policies of US imperialism at the meeting.

	Bariona, a representative of the Italian Socialist Youth League, also participated in the rally. He condemned the aggressive crimes of American militarism at the meeting. He emphasized that the relaxation of the international situation must be achieved through struggle, and that the struggle for peace is primarily a struggle against imperialism.

	Katzin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Labor Youth League, spoke at the end of the conference. He said that the US government should bear full responsibility for sabotaging the summit conference, and that the people of the world severely condemn the aggressive position of US imperialism. The United States is a vicious enemy of peace. Resolutely exposing the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism and raising vigilance can stop any war provocations by imperialism. Katzin finally shouted: "Down with the US imperialist war policy!"

	On the 24th, more than 1,200 faculty and students from Bahon University in Bucharest also held a rally. The president of the university, Lifescu, said at the meeting that the responsibility for sabotaging the summit conference should be fully borne by the US government headed by Eisenhower. All faculty and students of Bahon University protested against the US aggressive policy, because this is the bankrupt bandit policy of Hitler. Student Xitera said at the meeting that US imperialism sabotaged the summit conference, thereby exposing its true colors in front of the people of the world. We do not beg for peace, we must use weapons to defend peace.

	More than 5,000 employees of the "Red Grivița" Railway Factory in Bucharest also held a rally on this day. The resolution unanimously passed at the meeting stated, "We angrily protest against the shameful act of US imperialism in sabotaging the summit meeting. We fully support the just position of the Soviet Union. We will spare no effort to resolutely defend peace."

	At a rally held by more than 1,500 employees of the "Tudor Vladimirescu" factory, female worker Olga said that US imperialism's infringement upon Soviet airspace is a bandit act against the Soviet Union and the socialist camp. No honest person can remain silent about this despicable act.

	At a rally of employees of the Capital Cotton Mill, female worker Paltina said that US imperialism is despicably pursuing a policy against the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, and it is the true culprit for sabotaging the summit conference. She said that the imperialist aggressors should know that socialist countries are not afraid of any threats and will not be deceived. The socialist camp has the strength to smash any enemy who dares to undermine peace. Professor of Law, Ghelm Geffanu, also attended the rally at this factory. He said in his speech that the United States is the number one enemy of peace and human happiness.

	On this day, working people in cities such as Oradea, Timisoara, Pitesti, and Craiova also held mass rallies to protest against the US imperialist policy of aggression and firmly support the just position of the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 24th: The working people of Czechoslovakia continue to hold rallies to protest against the provocative activities of US imperialism against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Embassy in Czechoslovakia has received more than 4,000 letters and telegrams from people across Czechoslovakia expressing their support for the just position of the Soviet Union.

	In Theresienstadt, a peace rally of more than 30,000 people was held on the 22nd to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi Theresienstadt concentration camp by the Soviet army. Kopecki, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and Deputy Prime Minister of the government, condemned the aggressive actions of the United States in his speech. After recounting the crimes of the German fascists in cruelly murdering the Czechoslovak people, he said that now, it is US President Eisenhower who has committed the shameless crime of undermining peace. Eisenhower's crimes are exposed to the world, as are the crimes of Adenauer, his closest "ally" who harms and opposes peace.

	Kopecki said that Eisenhower is a perfidious enemy of peace who pays lip service to peace while undermining the basic principles of international law.

	In a resolution passed at a mass meeting of employees at the Žižkov Station in Prague, it was stated: The fact that the US government sabotaged the Four-Power Summit and attempted to legalize their espionage activities against the Soviet Union convinces us that US leaders are not at all "maintaining peace" as they often claim, but are creating tension and frantically preparing for war. The resolution said: We condemn the US Secretary of State Herter's unreasonable interference in our internal affairs.

	In a resolution passed at a mass meeting of workers at the Vitex Otvorovice factory, it was stated: We protest against the treacherous and provocative acts of the US government against the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp.

	Railway workers at Domažlice Station said in a letter to Rudé právo (Red Right): We fully support the firm position of the Soviet government and condemn the US government's espionage and aggressive policy, which is precisely what sabotaged the summit conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, May 24th: According to Mongolian newspapers and radio stations, the working masses of Mongolia have been holding rallies for days to support Khrushchev's statement in Paris on the 16th, angrily protesting against the aggressive crimes of US imperialism in sabotaging the Four-Power Summit.

	Teacher Nima Dorji said at a rally in the capital of Arkhangai Province that the "Cold War" policy pursued by a small number of people in the United States has hindered the resolution of important international issues, and the world public has expressed great anger at this. We must combine our voices with the voices of those who are fighting for the truth.

	Davaazab, Mongolia's first labor hero and miner, said in an interview with a reporter from Mongolian Radio that all coal miners in Mongolia, together with the people of the whole country, support Khrushchev's statement in Paris. He said that we firmly believe that the adventurous actions of imperialism will inevitably fail, and that the just cause of progressive humanity will surely win.

	Working people's rallies have also been held successively in the provincial capitals, state farms, and agricultural cooperatives of Bulgan, Choibalsan, South Gobi, Arkhangai, Bayan-Ölgii, and East Gobi provinces, protesting against the aggressive actions of US imperialism in unison.
