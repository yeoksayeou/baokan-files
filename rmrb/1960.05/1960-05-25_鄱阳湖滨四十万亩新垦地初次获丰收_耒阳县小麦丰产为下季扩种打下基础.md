    Forty Thousand Mu of Newly Reclaimed Land by Poyang Lake Reaps First Harvest
    Abundant Wheat Harvest in Leiyang County Lays Foundation for Expanded Planting Next Season
    (Our report) The forty thousand mu of newly reclaimed land by Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province has joyfully reaped its first abundant harvest of spring-ripening crops. The virgin land by Poyang Lake, which had been dormant for thousands of years, has now become an oil and grain storehouse for the first time. More than 220,000 mu of rapeseed and 180,000 mu of wheat, barley, broad beans and peas have been harvested and brought to the threshing grounds.
    According to surveys by counties and communes after threshing and drying, these spring-ripening crops have generally achieved bumper harvests, with some even matching or exceeding the yields of cultivated land. The tens of thousands of mu of rapeseed, wheat, and barley in the Jiujiang area have tall stalks and abundant, plump seeds. In Jiujiang County, the Jiangzhou, Gangkou, Xintang, and Maoshan Tou communes and reclamation farms have already inspected more than 1,400 mu of rapeseed, with an average yield of 72 jin per mu. In the Nanji Commune of Xinjian County, more than 1,000 mu of rapeseed achieved an average yield of 150 jin per mu, exceeding the yield of cultivated land.
    This is a great victory for the power of the people's communes and the policy of multiple high-yield crops. The Jiangxi coastal and lakeside areas have a large amount of continuous lake land that can be utilized during the dry season each year. Before communization, due to the small scale of production and the lack of unified planning and insufficient manpower and resources, very little was utilized. Last winter, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized the people of the lakeside areas to reclaim more than 400,000 mu in one go. Although they encountered a hundred days of drought, the broad masses of commune members, while cutting lake grass, carried water to irrigate the soil, and finally overcame the drought, planting rapeseed and other spring-ripening crops in the newly reclaimed lake fields and sandbars in a timely manner.
    Thanks to the careful management of the broad masses of commune members and the overcoming of various natural disasters, a bumper harvest has finally been achieved.
    (Our report) The broad masses of farmers in Leiyang County, Hunan Province, are joyfully rushing to harvest wheat and conscientiously summarizing the experiences of high yields in order to prepare for expanding wheat planting this winter. The county planted 93,000 mu of wheat this year, and more than 80,000 mu had been harvested by the 14th of this month. The total output increased significantly compared to last year. The Chengguan People's Commune has harvested more than 2,000 mu of wheat, with an average yield of 249 jin of dry wheat per mu, double that of last year. Xiao Manmei, a national model agricultural worker from the Nanjing Brigade of the Renyi Commune, achieved an average yield of 610 jin per mu on her 41 mu of high-yield wheat. The masses happily sang: "The Leishui River bank has a beautiful scenery, the wheat waves are surging with a golden color..." The bumper wheat harvest in Leiyang County this year has changed the conservative thinking of some people who believed that "the south is not suitable for growing wheat, and high yields cannot be achieved even if it is planted," and has further inspired the broad masses of commune members to actively demand the expansion of wheat planting. The county plans to increase the wheat planting area this winter by more than double that of last year. (Attached picture)

    鄱阳湖滨四十万亩新垦地初次获丰收
    耒阳县小麦丰产为下季扩种打下基础
    本报讯　江西省鄱阳湖滨四十多万亩新垦地喜获首次春熟作物大丰收。沉睡千年的鄱阳湖滨的处女地，如今第一次成了油库粮仓，二十二万多亩油菜和十八万多亩大小麦、蚕豌豆都已收割上场。
    根据已经脱粒晒干的县社调查，这些春熟作物普遍获得了丰收，有的还赶上和超过了熟地的产量。九江专区的十几万亩油菜、大小麦，株高籽多，粒粒饱满。九江县江洲、港口、新塘、毛山头等公社和垦殖场已经验收的一千四百多亩油菜，平均亩产达到七十二斤。新建县南矶公社，一千多亩油菜，平均亩产一百五十斤，超过了熟地产量。
    这是人民公社的威力和多种高产多收方针的伟大胜利。江西沿江滨湖地区，有着大量成片的湖洲地，每年枯水季节可以利用。公社化前，由于生产规模小，牧场没有统一规划，人力物力不足，所以，利用很少。去年冬天，中共江西省委动员滨湖地区人民一次就开垦了四十多万亩。当时虽遇到了百日大旱，广大社员一边砍去湖草，一边挑水浇土，终于战胜了干旱，在新开垦的湖田洲地上，及时种上了油菜等春熟作物。
    由于广大社员精心管理，战胜各种自然灾害，终于获得了丰收。
    本报讯　湖南省耒阳县广大农民正在喜气洋洋地抢收小麦，并认真总结丰产经验。为今冬扩种小麦作好准备。全县今年种植九万三千亩小麦，到本月14日止已收割八万多亩。总产量比去年显著增产。城关人民公社已收的二千多亩小麦，平均每亩收干麦二百四十九斤，比去年增产一倍。仁义公社南京大队全国农业劳动模范萧满妹种的四十一亩丰产麦，平均亩产达六百一十斤。群众兴高彩烈地唱道：“耒水河岸好风光，麦浪滔滔一片黄……”耒阳县今年的小麦大丰收，改变了某些人认为“南方不宜种小麦，种了也不能获高产”的保守思想，进一步鼓舞了广大社员，积极要求扩种小麦。全县计划今冬小麦的种植面积将比去年增加一倍多。（附图片）
