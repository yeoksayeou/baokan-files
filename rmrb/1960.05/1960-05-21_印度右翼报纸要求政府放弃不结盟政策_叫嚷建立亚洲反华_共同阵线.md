Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 19th - The Indian right-wing newspaper "The Times of India" published an editorial today demanding that the Indian government abandon its non-aligned policy and establish an anti-China "common front" in Asia.

The editorial slandered China's policies as "creating problems that affect the entire free Asian world." The newspaper frantically clamored that raising the "awareness" of "Asian independent countries" that are "sitting in the same boat" is a "great psychological advantage" for strengthening anti-China conspiracies. The editorial said that piecing together such an anti-China common front is a "perfectly legitimate undertaking."

The newspaper wants the Indian government to "consider this suggestion humbly" and said, "India's policy of refusing to participate in military alliances is effective to a certain extent under certain circumstances. But this does not mean that this effect can be maintained indefinitely and under any circumstances."

Another right-wing newspaper, "The Indian Express," published an article on May 4th, clamoring that "Panchsheel has been buried five fathoms deep" and that Sino-Indian relations have been "completely ruptured" due to the Sino-Indian border issue. The article stated that in the face of this "new situation," India's foreign policy should be "readjusted."

According to the author's adjustment plan, the Indian government should militarily "improve the defense work on India's northern border," and diplomatically should actively "make friends and influence the people around us (India)." The article further stated that the Indian government should "make friends with like-minded people" in the name of "common security."

    印度右翼报纸要求政府放弃不结盟政策
    叫嚷建立亚洲反华“共同阵线”
    新华社新德里19日电　印度右翼报纸“印度时报”今天发表社论，要求印度政府放弃不结盟政策，在亚洲建立反华“共同阵线”。
    社论污蔑中国的政策“造成的问题涉及到整个自由亚洲世界”。这家报纸疯狂地叫嚷说，提高“坐在同一条船上”的“亚洲独立国家”的“觉悟”，是加强反华阴谋的“心理上很大的有利条件。”社论说，拼凑这种反华共同战线是“十分正当的事业”。
    这家报纸要印度政府“虚心地考虑这种建议”，并说，“印度拒绝参加军事联盟的方针在一定情况下是有一定的效力的。但这并不等于说，这种效力可以无限期地和在任何情况下保持。”
    另一家右翼报纸“印度快报”曾在5月4日发表文章，叫嚷“潘查希拉已经埋葬了五丈深”，中印关系已经由于中印边界问题“完全决裂”。文章说，面对这种“新局势”，印度的外交政策应当“重新调整”。
    按照这篇文章作者的调整方案，印度政府应当在军事上“搞好印度北部边界的防御工作”，在外交上应该积极“交朋友和影响我们（印度）周围的人”。这篇文章进一步说，印度政府应该以“共同安全”为名同“志同道合的人交朋友”。
