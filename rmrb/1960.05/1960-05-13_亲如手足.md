　　After accompanying Premier Zhou Enlai on visits to the Jin Xing Rubber Factory, the Hanoi Soap Factory, and the Sheng Long Cigarette Factory, we have been unable to calm our excited and stirred feelings. The fervent emotion with which the Vietnamese worker brothers welcomed Premier Zhou reminded us of a famous Vietnamese poem that compares the people of China and Vietnam to: hand and foot, pestle and mortar, root and stem, brother and brother!

　　These three factories were all built with Chinese assistance. Their completion illustrates the immense talent of the Vietnamese people in economic construction under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, and at the same time, they are the crystallization of Sino-Vietnamese friendship!

　　Here, the Vietnamese worker brothers live and work alongside Chinese experts and workers, helping and learning from each other. Sino-Vietnamese friendship has not only blossomed here but also borne fruit. They, like all the Vietnamese people, cherish Sino-Vietnamese friendship as they would cherish the apple of their eye. Therefore, they were particularly happy to hear the news of Premier Zhou's visit to Vietnam. The workers of the soap factory and the rubber factory proposed to greet Premier Zhou with the achievement of producing the best products. The workers of the cigarette factory selected the best tobacco leaves and carefully crafted cigarettes to give to Premier Zhou. The staff of each factory also built arches and hung banners, waiting for Premier Zhou's arrival. How much they hoped to meet Premier Zhou!

　　On the 10th, the worker brothers' wishes came true. Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen Yi visited these three factories one after another on the afternoon of their arrival in Hanoi, and met with the factory directors, Party committee secretaries, technicians, and the broad masses of workers. Whether in the rubber factory, the soap factory, or the cigarette factory, whether in the roaring workshops or on the beautiful tree-lined paths, wherever Premier Zhou and Premier Pham Van Dong went, there were cheers and applause. Welcome banners were posted all over the workshops, and from the irregular handwriting, it could be seen that they were written by the Vietnamese worker brothers using the Chinese characters they had just learned. These slogans revealed the workers' feelings from the bottom of their hearts: "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong! Long live President Ho Chi Minh!" "May Sino-Vietnamese friendship last forever!" "Welcome Premier Zhou to visit Vietnam!" Almost all the machines were hung with the national flags of China and Vietnam, and some workers also used red paper to cluster large red flowers and insert them in the middle of the two national flags. Every workshop was decorated in colorful splendor.

　　During the visit, Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen Yi talked with Vietnamese comrades for a while, inquired about their production situation, praised their outstanding work, and wished them to achieve even more outstanding results; for a while, they talked with Chinese experts, encouraging them to help Vietnamese brothers learn technology on the one hand, and to learn from Vietnamese brothers on the other hand. Premier Zhou, Premier Pham Van Dong, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and others also took photos with some workers as a souvenir. The female workers in the cigarette factory gave the cigarettes they produced to Premier Zhou. Throughout the entire visit, every workshop was filled with a joyful scene, with laughter, slogans, and applause intertwined, which was both cordial and warm. It was truly a vivid picture of relatives reuniting after a long separation!

　　After the visit, Premier Zhou, Premier Pham Van Dong, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and others came to the square of the cigarette factory, where thousands of employees from the above-mentioned three factories and the Hanoi Machine Factory had already gathered. They waved red flags and cheered, welcoming the leaders of the two governments to the rostrum. The director of the soap factory delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the three factories and the Hanoi Machine Factory. He praised China's assistance to these factories and the work of Chinese experts. His speech embodied the deep friendship of the Vietnamese people towards the Chinese people.

　　When Premier Zhou Enlai spoke to the workers in the sunlight, the workers raised colorful flags and cheered enthusiastically, endlessly. Premier Zhou said that the factory director's speech just now was an over-praise of China, and that China's assistance to Vietnam was very small. He said that with the labor of the Vietnamese people and the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, anything can be done. Not to mention three factories, even thirty, three hundred, and three thousand factories can be built. At this time, all the employees constantly shouted slogans, expressing their determination to build their motherland. After the warm applause and slogans subsided, Premier Zhou then talked about when he first visited three and a half years ago, he only saw a match factory. What about today? He suddenly saw three newly built factories, and there are many other newly built factories in Hanoi. He believes that in another three years, the Vietnamese people will surely build more factories. Premier Zhou said: "You will definitely build the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in a faster, better and more economical way, just like what Comrade Factory Director said just now!" At this time, all the workers were even more excited and stirred, and thunderous applause swept the audience once again. Everyone also shouted together with Premier Zhou: "Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people!"

　　Premier Pham Van Dong also gave an impromptu speech with excitement. He confidently stated that the Vietnamese people will surely be able to build thousands of factories and build socialism in Vietnam! At this time, all the workers expressed their determination with louder applause and cheers.

　　At this brotherly gathering, the workers gave flowers to Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Vice Premier Chen Yi returned the flowers of friendship to Comrade Factory Director; the employees presented gifts to the distinguished Chinese guests, and Premier Zhou Enlai also gave the gifts he brought specially to these factories. Premier Zhou said when accepting the gifts: "We will take them back as a souvenir, as an eternal souvenir!"

　　Joy and friendship melted everyone's feelings together like milk and water. This is the friendship between our two peoples, this is the friendship between comrades, this is the friendship between brothers, it will always inspire us to strive forward for the construction of our respective motherlands!

    亲如手足
    新华社记者　于民生　胡本英
    随同周恩来总理参观金星橡胶厂、河内肥皂厂和升龙卷烟厂回来以后，我们兴奋和激动的心情一直不能平静下来。越南工人兄弟那种欢迎周总理的炽烈的感情，使我们忆起了越南一首著名的诗，这首诗把中越两国人民比喻为：如手和足，如杵和臼，如根和茎，如兄和弟！
    这三个工厂都是由中国帮助兴建的。它们的建成说明了越南人民在越南劳动党的领导下，在经济建设方面发挥了莫大的才智，同时它们也是中越友谊的结晶！
    这里的越南工人兄弟同中国专家和工人朝夕相处，一起工作，一起生活，互相帮助，互相学习。中越友谊在这里不仅开了花，而且结了果。他们和全体越南人民一样，像爱护自己的眼睛一样地珍视中越友谊。因此，当他们听到周总理前来越南访问的消息以后特别高兴。肥皂厂和橡胶厂的工人提出要以生产出最好的产品的成绩来迎接周总理。卷烟厂的工人们选择了最好的烟叶，精制出香烟准备送给周总理。各厂的职工们还搭牌楼，挂标语，等待着周总理的到来。他们是多么希望能够会见周总理！
    10日，工人兄弟们的愿望实现了。周总理、陈毅副总理在到达河内的当天下午就先后到这三个工厂参观，同厂长、党委书记、技术员及广大职工会见。不论是在橡胶厂、肥皂厂还是在卷烟厂，也不论是在机器轰响着的车间里还是在美丽的林荫道上，周总理和范文同总理走到那里，那里就是欢呼和鼓掌。欢迎的标语贴满了车间，从不规正的笔迹上，可以看出那是越南工人兄弟用自己刚学会的中国字写的。这些标语流露出工人们发自心底的感情：“毛泽东主席万岁！胡志明主席万岁！”“中越友谊万古长青！”“欢迎周总理访问越南！”几乎所有的机器上都挂着中越两国的国旗，有的工人还用红纸簇成大红花插在两国国旗中间。每个车间都打扮得彩色缤纷。
    周总理、陈毅副总理在参观的时候，一会儿跟越南的工人同志交谈，询问他们的生产情况，赞扬他们出色的工作，祝他们争取更优异的成绩；一会儿又跟中国专家谈话，勉励他们一方面好好帮助越南兄弟学习技术，另一方面好好向越南兄弟学习。周总理、范文同总理和陈毅副总理等还同一些工人一起照相留念。卷烟厂里的女工们把她们自己生产的香烟送给了周总理。在整个参观过程中，各个车间都是一片喜气洋洋的欢乐景象，欢笑、口号声和掌声交织在一起，既亲切又热烈，真是一幅久别重逢的亲人相会的生动图景！
    参观以后，周总理、范文同总理和陈毅副总理等来到卷烟厂的广场，这里早已聚集着几千名上述三个工厂和河内机器厂的职工。他们摇动着红旗，欢呼着把两国政府的领导人迎上主席台。肥皂厂的厂长代表三个工厂和河内机器厂致欢迎词，他赞扬中国对这些工厂的帮助和中国专家的工作，在他的讲话中体现了越南人民对中国人民抱有深厚友谊。
    当周恩来总理迎着阳光向工人们讲话的时候，工人们举起彩旗，热情地欢呼，经久不息。周总理说，刚才厂长的讲话对中国是过奖了，中国对越南的援助是很微小的。他说，有了越南人民的劳动，有了越南劳动党的领导，什么事情都是可以做到的，不要说三个工厂，就是三十个、三百个、三千个工厂都会建设起来的。这时候，全体职工不断地高呼口号，表示他们建设祖国的决心。在热烈的掌声和口号声平息以后，周总理又谈到三年半以前他第一次来访时，只看了一个火柴厂，今天呢？一下子就看了三个新建的工厂，而河内还有其它许多新建的工厂。他相信，再过三年，越南人民一定会建设起更多的工厂。周总理说：“你们一定会像刚才厂长同志所说的那样，多快好省地把越南民主共和国建设起来！”这时候，全体工人更加兴奋和激动，雷鸣般的掌声再一次席卷全场。大家并且同周总理一起高呼：“中越两国人民之间永恒的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！”
    范文同总理也兴奋地即席讲话。他充满信心地表示，越南人民一定能够建设起千百个工厂，在越南建成社会主义！这时，全体工人以更响亮的鼓掌和欢呼表达他们的决心。
    在这兄弟般的聚会上，工人们把鲜花送给周总理和陈毅副总理，陈毅副总理又把这友谊的鲜花回敬给厂长同志；职工们向中国贵宾赠送了礼品，周恩来总理也把他特地带来的礼物送给了这几个工厂。周总理在接受礼品时说：“我们带回去作为纪念，作为永远的纪念！”
    欢乐、友谊，使大家的感情像乳水般地交融在一起。这就是我们两国人民之间的友谊，这是同志之间的友谊，是兄弟之间的友谊，它将永远激励着我们为建设各自的祖国奋发而向前！
