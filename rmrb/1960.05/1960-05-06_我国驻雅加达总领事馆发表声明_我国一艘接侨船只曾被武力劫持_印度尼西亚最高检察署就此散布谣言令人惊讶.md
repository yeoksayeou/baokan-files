Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 4th: The spokesperson for the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta issued a statement on May 3rd, pointing out that the news released by the Indonesian Attorney General's Office that "the ship sent by China to pick up overseas Chinese returning home escaped Indonesian territorial waters" is completely fabricated.

    The statement said that according to accurate information received by the Chinese Consulate General from the Chinese Consulate in Medan, the "Da Baokang" ship sent by the Chinese government to pick up returning overseas Chinese had completed all formalities and obtained permission to depart, but was detained in Selat Panjang due to gunfire by relevant Indonesian personnel on April 27th. The details of this incident are as follows:

    After the Chinese Embassy notified the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of its decision to send the "Da Baokang" to Selat Panjang in Riau Province to pick up the fire-stricken overseas Chinese returning home, Liu Qingyou, the consular attache of the Chinese Consulate in Medan, went to Riau Province on April 15th to handle the repatriation of overseas Chinese.

    After consultation, Captain Selamat of the Riau Provincial Military District, representing the provincial authorities, agreed on the 16th to simplify the repatriation procedures for the fire-stricken overseas Chinese. The Governor also sent Zalik Aris, the head of Bengkalis Regency, as a plenipotentiary representative to work with Chinese consular attache Liu Qingyou to handle the repatriation of overseas Chinese in Selat Panjang. Consular Attache Liu Qingyou, on behalf of the Consulate, processed the collective return certificates for 702 fire-stricken overseas Chinese on the 20th and 21st.

    From the 21st to the 25th, the Indonesian side should have completed all necessary procedures for the repatriation of the fire-stricken overseas Chinese. The Indonesian Immigration Office, Prosecutor's Office, Army Office, Police Station, and Tax Bureau jointly handled this issue. Before the 25th, the Immigration Office signed the certificates, allowing 702 fire-stricken overseas Chinese to return home collectively. The above five Indonesian agencies also signed the documents allowing the overseas Chinese to leave the country. The Tax Bureau also issued receipts proving tax payment and certificates of tax reduction and exemption. On the 25th and 26th, the relevant Indonesian authorities inspected all the luggage of the returning overseas Chinese. These overseas Chinese, having experienced a fire, were already very poor. The 702 overseas Chinese compatriots had a total of only 366 pieces of luggage of all sizes, including old bicycles. However, four bicycles and three sewing machines were still detained.

    On April 22nd, the overseas Chinese were required to give fingerprints. At that time, the Indonesian side wanted each of the 702 fire-stricken returning overseas Chinese to give 72 fingerprints. The overseas Chinese requested special arrangements because the relevant parties had previously agreed that the procedures would be simplified. After consultation between consular attache Liu Qingyou and Zalik Aris, the plenipotentiary representative of the Governor, Aris agreed to use signatures instead of fingerprints for the time being, and he agreed to report to the Governor at the same time. The overseas Chinese therefore signed. Until April 26th, they had not received any notice to give fingerprints again.

    Since all formalities had been completed, Aris, the Governor's plenipotentiary representative, notified consular attache Liu Qingyou at 10:00 a.m. on April 26th that "all formalities have been completed and the ship can depart at 4:00 p.m." That same afternoon, Adnan, Aris's assistant and the head of the Alien Affairs Bureau, again notified consular attache Liu Qingyou that "the formalities have been completed and the ship can leave." At the same time, the Immigration Office returned the signed collective return certificates to the returning overseas Chinese and returned the passports to the ship's crew. The port affairs administration also handed over the entry documents to the captain of the "Da Baokang." It was already dusk, so the ship could not leave the port. It decided to depart at 5:00 a.m. the next day. Because one of the ship's cylinders broke down the next day, it did not leave until before 8:00 a.m.

    At this moment, the Prosecutor's Office in Pekanbaru suddenly called, insisting that the returning overseas Chinese had not completed the formalities and would not allow the ship to leave. After learning that the ship had left, it ordered the ship to be hijacked by force. The Prosecutor General of Selat Panjang, following the orders of his superiors, sent police officers in speedboats to chase and hijack the "Da Baokang." Even more seriously, the police officers on the speedboats even fired shots at the "Da Baokang," forcing it to return to Selat Panjang. The "Da Baokang" was forced to return to Selat Panjang immediately.

    At that time, the only reason given by the relevant Indonesian authorities was that the overseas Chinese had not given fingerprints. Consular Attache Liu Qingyou immediately expressed regret over the forced return of the "Da Baokang" and pointed out that the authorities had notified him twice the day before that all formalities had been completed and the ship could depart. Even when the ship left, the authorities had not expressed any objection to the use of signatures instead of fingerprints. Consular Attache Liu Qingyou believed that this contradictory action was obviously intended to create an incident.

    At 11:00 a.m., representatives were sent again by Adnan, the assistant to the Governor's plenipotentiary representative, Sudiarto, the chief of the Selat Panjang Police Station, and Yaya, the representative of the garrison there. They again notified Consular Attache Liu that the decision of April 26th remained unchanged and that the "Da Baokang" could still depart immediately; they apologized for the incident that had just occurred. Then, these three representatives boarded the "Da Baokang" with Consular Attache Liu, and Police Chief Sudiarto personally notified the captain to set sail.

    When the ship's British captain spoke with the police, he also expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the practice of using force and gunfire to force the ship to return, because all departure formalities had been completed.

    At 12:00 noon that day, the local authorities sent military police in speedboats to escort the "Da Baokang" out of Selat Panjang Port.

    Consular Attache Liu Qingyou left Selat Panjang on April 28th, taking a boat arranged by the local government via Bengkalis to Pekanbaru. He returned to Medan on the 30th. When Consular Attache Liu Qingyou passed through Pekanbaru, he again described in detail to Captain Selamat, the local military representative, the situation of his care for these fire-stricken overseas Chinese returning to China. He was well received by the local authorities when he was in Pekanbaru. When he set off for Medan, the acting commander of Pekanbaru and the representative of the mayor saw him off at the airport.

    It is worth mentioning that Consular Attache Liu Qingyou had good cooperation with the local military and political authorities when taking care of those overseas Chinese returning home. For example, he asked the local Overseas Chinese Association to quickly help the relevant parties to complete various procedures in order to work through the night to rush-print the required photos for each household, fill out various necessary forms, and print eleven forms for more than 700 overseas Chinese. Local military and political officials also expressed satisfaction with this cooperation.

    In discussing the details of the above incident, the spokesperson for the Consulate General pointed out that the act of forcibly detaining the Chinese government ship chartered to transport overseas Chinese returning home in Selat Panjang was an extremely unfriendly act. Obviously, some people were attempting to create trouble, obstruct and sabotage the return of overseas Chinese, thereby further damaging the friendly relations between China and Indonesia. The spokesperson said that the incident has been reported to the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, and the Embassy will discuss this issue with the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

    The spokesperson expressed surprise at the statement issued by the Indonesian Attorney General on May 2nd and 3rd to Antara News Agency, because, judging from the above situation, the claims that "overseas Chinese adopted an attitude against the (Indonesian) government's regulations" and that "the ship transporting overseas Chinese back home escaped Indonesian territorial waters without permission" are unfounded. The spokesperson said that he learned from the newspapers that around April 26th, that is, around the time of the incident, Attorney General Gunawan was visiting the oil installations and oil wells of the US Texaco Oil Company in Duri, Minas, and Dumai in Riau Province at the invitation of the United States and was conducting inspections in Riau Province. The possibility that he accurately understood the situation at that time should exist.

### 我国驻雅加达总领事馆发表声明  我国一艘接侨船只曾被武力劫持  印度尼西亚最高检察署就此散布谣言令人惊讶

    我国驻雅加达总领事馆发表声明
    我国一艘接侨船只曾被武力劫持
    印度尼西亚最高检察署就此散布谣言令人惊讶
    新华社雅加达4日电　中国驻雅加达总领事馆发言人在5月3日发表声明，指出印度尼西亚最高检察署发布的所谓“中国派来接华侨回国的船逃出了印度尼西亚领海”的消息完全是捏造的。
    声明说，据中国总领事馆收到的中国驻棉兰领事馆的正确消息说，中国政府派去接载归国华侨的“大宝康号”已经办了一切手续，并且得到启程的许可，但是由于印度尼西亚有关人士在4月27日进行开火而被扣留在实叻班让。这次事件的详细情况如下：
    在中国大使馆通知印度尼西亚外交部，它决定派遣“大宝康号”到廖内省的实叻班让去接那里的遭遇火灾的华侨归国以后，中国驻棉兰领事馆随习领事刘庆有在4月15日到廖内省去处理接送华侨回国的事项。
    经过磋商以后，廖内省军区的塞拉马特上尉在16日代表省当局同意简化遭遇火灾的华侨的归国手续。省长还派遣望加丽县县长扎利克·阿里斯为全权代表，同中国随习领事刘庆有一起处理遣送实叻班让的华侨回国的事项。随习领事刘庆有在20日和21日代表领事馆去办理七百零二名遭遇火灾的华侨集体回国的证书手续。
    从21日至25日，印度尼西亚方面应当完成遭受火灾的华侨归国的一切必要手续。印度尼西亚方面的移民局、检察署、陆军办事处、警察局和税务局共同处理了这个问题。25日以前，移民局在证书上签了字，准许七百零二个遭受火灾的华侨集体返国。上述五个印度尼西亚机关还在文件上签字准许华侨离境。税务局还发了证明税款缴清的单据和减税和免税的证书。在25日和26日，印度尼西亚的有关方面检查了归国华侨的全部行李。这些华侨由于经历了火灾，已非常贫困。七百零二名华侨同胞总共只有三百六十六件大小行李，其中还包括旧自行车。然而仍有四辆自行车和三架缝纫机被扣留。
    在4月22日，华侨被要求盖手印。那时候，印度尼西亚方面要七百零二个遭受火灾的归国华侨每人盖七十二个手印。华侨要求特别安排，因为有关方面事先曾同意，手续将予以简化。经过随习领事刘庆有同省长全权代表扎利克·阿里斯的磋商，阿里斯同意，暂时用签名而不用手印，他同意同时将向省长请示。华侨因此签了字。直到4月26日，他们还没有接到要再一次盖手印的任何通知。
    由于一切手续已经办理完毕，省长的全权代表阿里斯在4月26日上午十时通知随习领事刘庆有说，“一切手续已经办理完毕，这条船可以在下午4时启程”。就在那一天下午，阿里斯的助理、外侨管理局局长阿德南再次通知随习领事刘庆有说，“手续已经办完，这条船可以离开”。同时，移民局把已经签字的集体回国证件发还给归国华侨，并且把护照发还给船上的工作人员。负责港口事务的管理局也把入境证件交给了“大宝康号”的船长。那时暮色已经降临，因此这条船不能离开港口。它决定在第二天五时启程。由于第二天这条船的一个汽缸发生了故障，它在上午八点以前并没有离开。
    就在这个时候，北干巴鲁的检察署突然来了电话，坚持认为归国华侨还没有办完手续，并且不让这条船离开，在获悉了这条船已经离开以后，又命令以武力劫持这条船。实叻班让的检察长按照他的上级领导的命令派遣警察乘快艇追赶并且劫持“大宝康号”。更为严重的是，快艇上的警察甚至向“大宝康号”开枪射击，强迫它返回实叻班让。“大宝康号”被迫立即返回实叻班让。
    在那个时候，印度尼西亚有关方面提出的唯一的理由是华侨并没有按手印。随习领事刘庆有立即对“大宝康号”被迫驶回表示遗憾，并且指出，当局在前一天两次通知他说，一切手续已经完毕，这条船可以启程。直到这条船离开的时候，当局也还没有对以签名代替指印表示异议。随习领事刘庆有认为，这种前后矛盾的行动显然是为了有意制造事件。
    在上午十一时，有关方面再次派省长全权代表助理阿德南、实叻班让警察局长苏迪阿托和那里驻军代表雅雅为代表，他们再次通知刘随习领事，4月26日的决定保持不变，“大宝康号”仍然可以立即启程；他们为刚刚发生的事件作了道歉。接着，这三人代表同刘随习领事一起登上了“大宝康号”船，警察局长苏迪阿托亲自通知船长启航。
    这条船的英籍船长同警察谈话时，也对以武力和开枪来强迫轮船驶回的做法表示极为不满，因为启航的一切手续都已办完了。
    在这天中午十二点，当地当局派军警乘快艇护送“大宝康号”驶出实叻班让港。
    刘随习领事在4月28日离开实叻班让，乘着当地政府所派的船只取道望加丽到北干巴鲁去。他在30日回到棉兰。刘随习领事在经过北干巴鲁的时候，再次向当地军方代表塞拉马特上尉详述了他照料这些遭受火灾的华侨返回中国的情况。他在北干巴鲁时受到当地当局的很好的接待。当他启程前往棉兰时，北干巴鲁的代理司令和市长代表在机场上欢送他。
    值得提出的是，随习领事刘庆有在照料那些华侨回国时同当地的军政当局进行了很好的合作。例如，他要求那里的华侨总会迅速帮助有关方面办理各种手续以便通宵赶印出所需的各户每个人的照片、填写各种必要表格和印出七百多名华侨的十一份表格等项工作。当地军政官员对于这种合作也表示满意。
    在谈到上述事件的细节时，总领事馆发言人指出，实叻班让发生的武力拘留中国政府派去接运华侨回国的船只的行动是极不友好的行动，显然，有些人企图闹事，阻挠和破坏华侨回国，从而进一步破坏中国和印度尼西亚的友好关系。发言人说，已经把这个事件报告了中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆，大使馆将就这个问题同印度尼西亚外交部进行讨论。
    发言人对于印度尼西亚最高检察长在5月2日和3日向安塔拉通讯社发表的声明表示惊讶，因为从上述情况来看，所谓“华侨采取了反对（印度尼西亚）政府规定的态度”和“接运华侨回国的船只未经许可擅自逃出印度尼西亚领海”的说法是毫无根据的。发言人说，他从报纸获悉，在4月26日左右，也就是说，在事件发生的前后，最高检察长贡纳万应美国邀请正在廖内省北干巴鲁某地参观美国德士古石油公司在杜里、米纳斯和杜迈的石油装置和油井，并在廖内省进行视察。他可能确切地了解了当时的情况，这种可能性是应该存在的。
