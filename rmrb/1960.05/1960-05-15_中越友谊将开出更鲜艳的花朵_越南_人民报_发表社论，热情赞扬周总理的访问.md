Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 14th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" today published an editorial titled "Forward Side by Side Forever" on Premier Zhou Enlai's conclusion of his five-day friendly visit to Vietnam.

The editorial said: "During these five days, the deep friendship between the Vietnamese people and the fraternal Chinese people has been overflowing. In the enthusiastic atmosphere of the glorious victory of the second National Assembly election, we warmly welcomed and received Premier Zhou Enlai – a comrade and friend beloved by the Vietnamese people, and an envoy of peace and friendship – with deep emotion. Premier Zhou Enlai once again brought us the deep fraternal affection of the fraternal Chinese people."

The editorial said: "At Gia Lam Airport, in Hanoi, Hai Phong and the Hong Quang mining area visited by Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi, and at the mass rally in Ba Dinh Square, we expressed our enthusiasm to Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and other accompanying comrades and thanked China for its selfless assistance to our country with unparalleled excitement.”

The editorial said: "Like Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Vietnam more than three years ago, Premier Zhou Enlai's visit this time has strengthened the long-standing, inseparable friendship between the people of our two countries. As Premier Pham Van Dong said: 'Since our two countries stood together in the socialist camp, the inherent friendship and mutual love between the people of our two countries have blossomed into the most vivid flowers. It is firmly believed that this "everlasting" friendship will surely bloom even more vividly in the future.'"

The editorial said: "Vietnamese-Chinese friendship not only originates from history and is deeply rooted in the emotions of the people of the countries but is also built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, the spirit of proletarian internationalism, ideological consistency, and the common struggle for the noble ideals of national independence, socialism, and communism. We are pleased to see the unanimous views reached by both sides on current major international issues in the talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Pham Van Dong and in the speeches of the leaders of the two governments. Premier Zhou Enlai once said: 'In the great cause of striving for world peace, human progress, and building socialism, the people of China and Vietnam will always advance hand in hand.'"

The editorial said: "The Vietnamese people fully realize that unity of will and thought is the invincible strength of the socialist camp. The solidarity and unity of China and Vietnam are not only beneficial to the socialist camp but also an important guarantee for the victory of peace in Asia and the world. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Vietnam has made this guarantee play a more powerful role and greatly inspired the people of North Vietnam who are building socialism and the people of our country who are struggling for the reunification of the motherland."

The editorial concluded: "Today, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and all the accompanying personnel are starting their journey back home. Our people sincerely thank them and Premier Zhou Enlai for their kind encouragement to us. We would like to express our deep gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Chinese people, and wish the fraternal Chinese people great victories in socialist construction. Bearing in mind the profound and friendly memories of Premier Zhou Enlai's visit, we are willing to strengthen the everlasting friendship between the people of our country and the people of China. We wish Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and all accompanying personnel a safe journey."

    中越友谊将开出更鲜艳的花朵
    越南“人民报”发表社论，热情赞扬周总理的访问
    新华社河内14日电　越南“人民报”今天就周恩来总理结束在越南为期五天的友好访问，发表题为“永远并肩前进”的社论。
    社论说：“在这五天里，洋溢着越南人民同兄弟的中国人民之间的深切友谊。在第二届国会的选举获得辉煌胜利的热烈气氛中，我们以深刻的感情热烈欢迎和接待周恩来总理——越南人民所敬爱的同志和朋友，和平和友谊的使者。周恩来总理再一次给我们带来了兄弟的中国人民深切的兄弟般的情谊。
    社论说：“在嘉林机场上、在周恩来总理和陈毅副总理所访问的河内、海防和鸿广矿区以及在巴亭广场的群众大会上，我们无比兴奋地向周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和同行的其他同志表达了自己对中国人民的热情和感谢中国对我国的无私援助。”
    社论说：“像周恩来总理三年多以前对越南的访问一样，周恩来总理这一次的访问密切了我们越中两国人民之间悠久的唇齿相依的情谊。正如范文同总理所说：‘自从我们两国一起站在社会主义阵营里之后，我们两国人民之间固有的友谊和互爱，已经开放出了最鲜艳的花朵，深信这种“万古长青”的友谊一定会在今后开放出更鲜艳的花朵’。”
    社论说：“越中友谊不仅是来源于历史，在两国人民的情感中根深蒂固，而且是建立在马克思列宁主义、无产阶级国际主义精神、思想一致和为民族独立、社会主义和共产主义崇高理想而共同奋斗的基础上。我们高兴地看到，在周恩来总理同范文同总理的会谈和两国政府领导人的发言中，双方对当前国际重大问题所取得的一致看法。周恩来总理曾经说：‘在争取世界和平、人类进步和建设社会主义的伟大事业中，中越两国人民将永远携手前进’。”
    社论说：“越南人民充分地认识到，意志和思想的统一，是社会主义阵营的无敌力量。越中两国的团结一致，不但有利于社会主义阵营，而且是使亚洲和世界和平事业取得胜利的重要保障之一。周恩来总理这次访问越南，使这一保障发挥了更强大的作用，大大地鼓舞了正在建设社会主义的北越人民和进行统一祖国斗争的我国人民。”
    社论最后说：“今天，周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和各位同行启程回国，我国人民真诚地感谢他们，感谢周恩来总理对我们亲切的鼓舞。我们谨对中国共产党、毛主席和中国人民表示深切的感谢，并祝兄弟般的中国人民在社会主义建设中取得巨大胜利。牢记着周恩来总理来访的深刻的友好的记忆，我们愿加强我国人民和中国人民之间万古长青的友谊。谨祝周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和各位随行人员一路平安。”
