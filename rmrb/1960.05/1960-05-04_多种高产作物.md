Multiple high-yield crops are a very important aspect of tapping potential and a shortcut to developing agricultural production at high speed. The rapid change in the backward state of agricultural production on the Huaibei Plain in Anhui Province is a strong proof of this. This disaster-prone and impoverished area in the past has, in recent years, rapidly expanded its rice acreage with the large-scale development of river network projects and has continuously increased the acreage of "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes and improved varieties of corn. It has transformed from a grain-deficient area into a surplus grain area, and many poor villages, dead depressions, and barren lakes have become "little Jiangnan." Fuyang County last year expanded the planting area of high-yield crops such as rice and sweet potatoes to 1.5 million mu, accounting for 60% of the cultivated land area. The increased grain production reached more than 400 million jin, and the average grain possession per person in the county reached 1,267 jin. In 1957, the average grain possession per person in this county was only 670 jin, an increase of nearly double in two years. Similar examples are numerous throughout the country.

Planting multiple high-yield crops is a good way to increase production with less effort. Judging from the situation in various places, replanting one mu of paddy field generally requires thirteen more workdays than planting one mu of dry land grain, but the grain produced by each workday is about twice as much as planting dry land grain. As for planting improved varieties of sweet potatoes such as "Victory No. 100," not only is the yield two to three times higher than that of ordinary local varieties, but it is also four to five times higher than the yield of sorghum. However, the labor input for the two is not very different. There is such an example in Chahua Commune of Fuyang County: Maoqiao Brigade of this commune made detailed records of labor and cost for early rice, spring sweet potatoes, and spring sorghum last year. The whole brigade planted a total of 955 mu of early rice, with an average yield of 1,410 jin of rice and 800 jin of rice straw per mu, worth a total of 114.7 yuan. The actual cost of fertilizer, seeds, pesticides, and depreciation of farm tools only amounted to 25.62 yuan per mu. The net income per mu of paddy field reached 89.08 yuan, with an average labor input of 27.1 days per mu. The value created by each labor day was 3.29 yuan. The whole team planted 230 mu of spring sweet potatoes, with an average yield of 1,847 jin per mu (calculated at four jin equivalent to one jin of grain). Calculated in the same way as rice, the value created by each labor day reached 5.4 yuan. The value created by planting sorghum was the least. The whole brigade planted 103 mu of sorghum, with an average yield of 193 jin per mu, and the value created by each labor day was only 1.75 yuan.

Multiple high-yield crops can also better implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified economy. Farmers in many places have such an experience: "It's good to grow rice, it's good to grow rice, you can harvest more grain and more grass, pigs have bran and cattle have grass." It is not too difficult to harvest 600 jin of rice per mu, which can provide 48 jin of bran (calculated at 8% bran yield per dan of rice) and 500 jin of grass. According to one jin of concentrate feed per pig per day, the bran from seven or eight mu of paddy field can supply one pig for a year. The grass from every seven mu of paddy field is enough for one head of draft animal to eat for a year, which is particularly meaningful in the grass-deficient areas of the northern plains. Some paddy fields can also raise fish, and rice husks are raw materials for making furfural. Sweet potatoes also have a great effect on the development of diversified economy. Each mu of sweet potatoes can harvest 400 jin of vines and leaves. Calculated at four jin per pig per day, the vines and leaves of every three and a half mu of sweet potatoes are enough for one pig to eat for a year. Moreover, sweet potatoes can be used to make sugar, wine, etc., and the ways of comprehensive utilization are very broad. Corn is even more "a treasure from head to toe." Farmers sing praises: "Corn is good, with high yield, it can be eaten as fine grain, it is also a concentrate feed, it has great industrial use, and its economic value is high. It is really a treasure." The by-products and corn cobs after processing the corn kernels from one mu of land are enough to fatten four pigs with the required concentrate feed; the corn stalks from one mu of corn, after silage, are enough for one pig's roughage needs. Corn is also an important industrial raw material. More than 200 kinds of industrial products can be made using corn kernels, stalks, and bract leaves.

There are many other benefits of planting multiple high-yield crops. For example, changing dry land to paddy fields can improve soil structure, reduce the alkalinity of dry land, accelerate fertilizer decomposition, and increase organic matter after rice roots are plowed. It can also reduce weeds and pests such as rice stem borers. Replanting wheat in fields that have grown rice generally yields about 25% higher than wheat grown in dry land. The Huaibei area of Anhui has made rice-wheat rotation the main cropping system for continuing to vigorously develop grain production in the next few years.

Judging from the current area of crops planted in various places, the planting area of high-yield crops should continue to expand. Judging from the yield per unit area of high-yield crops, the average yield is still relatively far from the yield of large-area high-yield fields, and the difference is even greater compared with the yield of typical high-yield fields. Therefore, whether it is expanding the area of high-yield crops or increasing the yield per unit area, the potential is great. As long as we seize the link of planting multiple high-yield crops, supplemented by various effective measures to increase production, this year's agricultural production leap forward target can be fully completed and overfulfilled.

Planting multiple high-yield crops is the requirement of the broad masses. However, changing to planting high-yield crops is a revolution in cropping system and crop varieties. It is necessary not only to fight against various kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas, but also to solve many specific problems in the process of replanting. The experience of many places proves that as long as the Party committee has great determination and goes deep into the grassroots to mobilize the masses and summarize experience, the replanting of high-yield crops can be rapidly promoted. Establishing a strong team for replanting high-yield crops, with the secretary taking the lead at the top and professional teams at the bottom, the task of expanding planting can be successfully completed. Technical issues cannot be ignored, because improper replanting will bring more ideological obstacles. Various places have adopted effective methods of imparting technology, such as running training courses, holding on-site meetings, sending people out, and inviting people in. In accordance with the characteristics of high-yield crops, the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture should be implemented, and basic constructions such as water conservancy and fertilizer should be followed up. There should be an overall plan, adapting to local conditions, and basing the replanting of high-yield crops on a basis that is both active and reliable. In addition to carrying out political activities such as planting red flags and setting up pacesetters, it is also necessary to encourage multiple high-yield crops from the policy level. Some places adopt contracting production according to soil quality and contracting work according to crops, so that more rewards and incentives can be obtained for planting multiple high-yield crops, thereby stimulating the enthusiasm of the masses for planting multiple high-yield crops. At the same time, support should also be given in terms of material aspects such as funds, fertilizers, and advanced tools.

This year, whether in the south or the north, preparations are being made to expand the planting area of high-yield crops. This will definitely play a significant role in completing this year's agricultural production leap forward target. In particular, planting multiple high-yield crops in the spring has special significance. Because the spring season is extremely favorable for the growth of crops, high-yield crops sown in the spring have higher yields than those planted in the summer. For example, early rice is generally 10% higher than mid-season rice, spring sweet potatoes can increase production by 60% compared with summer sweet potatoes, and spring corn can harvest more than 50% more than summer corn. In areas prone to drought and flood in the autumn, planting multiple high-yield crops in the spring can also avoid disasters and the harvest is more secure and reliable. The spring plowing and sowing season has now entered its climax. Various places should seize the good spring time, further and extensively mobilize the masses, and plant as many high-yield crops as possible in the spring sowing, laying a solid foundation for a greater harvest this year.

    多种高产作物
    石正章　李祥仁
    多种高产作物，是挖掘潜力的一个很重要的方面，是高速度发展农业生产的一条捷径。安徽省淮北平原农业生产落后面貌的迅速改变，就是很有力的实证。这个过去多灾、贫困的地区，最近几年来随着河网化工程的大发展，连年扩大水稻面积，连年增加“胜利百号”甘薯和良种玉米的面积，已变缺粮区为余粮区，并且使很多穷庄、死洼、荒湖成了“小江南”。阜阳县去年水稻、甘薯等高产作物的种植面积扩大到一百五十万亩，占耕地面积的60％，增产的粮食达四亿多斤，全县每人平均占有粮食达到了一千二百六十七斤。而这个县在1957年每人平均只有粮食六百七十斤，两年就增加了将近一倍。类似这样的事例，在全国各地都是不少的。
    多种高产作物，是费力小、增产大的好办法。从各地的情况看，改种一亩水稻，一般比种一亩旱粮要多花十三个工，但每个工生产的粮食，却比种旱粮多出一倍左右。至于种植“胜利百号”等良种甘薯，不但比一般土种的产量要高出两三倍，而且比种高粱的产量要高四、五倍，但两者花费的劳动力相差并不太多。阜阳县插花公社有这样的实例：这个社的毛桥大队，去年对早稻、春甘薯、春高粱的用工、成本作了详细的记录，全队共种早稻九百五十五亩，平均亩产稻谷一千四百一十斤，稻草八百斤，共值一百一十四元七角，而实际投入的肥料、种籽、农药、农具折旧等费用，每亩只合二十五元六角二分。每亩水稻的纯收入达八十九元零八分，平均每亩用工二十七点一个，每个劳动日创造的价值是三元二角九分。全队种春甘薯二百三十亩，平均亩产一千八百四十七斤（四斤折一斤粮食计算），和水稻一样计算，每个劳动日创造的价值达五元四角。种高粱所花费的工，得到的产值最少，全队一百零三亩高粱，平均亩产一百九十三斤，每个劳动日创造的价值只有一元七角五分。
    多种高产作物，还能更好地贯彻以粮为纲，全面发展多种经济的方针。许多地方的农民有这样的体会：“种稻好，种稻好，多收粮食多收草，猪有糠来牛有草”。每亩水稻收六百斤稻谷并不太难，它可以提供四十八斤糠（按每担稻谷8％的出糠率计算）、五百斤草。按一头猪一天一斤精饲料，七、八亩水稻的糠就能供给一头猪吃一年。每七亩水稻的草，就够一头耕畜吃一年，这在北方平原缺草地区就显得格外有意义。有些水田还可以养鱼，稻壳又是制糠醛的原料。甘薯对发展多种经济的作用也很大，每亩甘薯可收蔓叶四百斤，以一头猪每天吃四斤计算，每三亩半甘薯的蔓叶就够一头猪吃一年。而且甘薯又能制糖、制酒等等，综合利用的门路非常广阔。玉米更是“全身是宝”，农民歌颂说：“玉米好，产量高，能当细粮吃，又是精饲料，工业用途大，经济价值高，真是一个宝”。一亩地的玉米籽，加工后的副产品和玉米芯子，就足够养肥四头猪所需要的精饲料；一亩玉米的秸秆，青贮后足够一头猪需要的粗饲料。玉米又是工业的重要原料，利用玉米籽、秸秆、苞叶等可制二百多种工业品。
    多种高产作物的好处还有很多。例如旱地改种水稻，能改良土壤结构、减轻旱地的碱性，能加速肥料分解，稻根翻犁后能增加有机质，又能减少杂草和吸浆虫等虫害。种过水稻的田再种小麦，比旱地种的小麦产量一般要高25％左右。安徽淮北地区已把稻麦连作作为今后几年内继续大力发展粮食生产的主要耕作制度。
    从目前各地种植的作物面积来看，高产作物还应该继续扩大；从高产作物的单位面积产量看，平均产量距离大面积丰产田的产量还较大，与典型高额丰产田的产量相比，相差就更远。所以不管是扩大高产作物面积或是提高单位面积产量，潜力都是很大的，只要我们抓住多种高产作物这一环，辅之以各种有效增产措施，今年的农业生产跃进指标，是完全可以完成和超额完成的。
    多种高产作物，是广大群众的要求。但是改种高产作物，是耕作制度和作物品种上的一场革命，不仅要与各种各样的右倾保守思想作斗争，也要解决很多改种过程中的具体问题。很多地方的经验证明，只要党委决心大，深入细致地去发动群众、总结经验，高产作物的改种工作就能迅速推开。建立改种高产作物的强有力的班子，上有书记挂帅，下有专业队伍，扩种任务就能胜利完成。技术问题也不能忽视，因为改种不好，就会带来更多的思想障碍。各地采取办训练班、开现场会、派出去、请进来等等，都是传授技术的有效办法。要按照高产作物的特点，贯彻农业“八字宪法”，水利、肥料等基本建设都要跟上去。要有全盘的规划，因地制宜，把改种高产作物建立在既积极又可靠的基础上。除了从政治上进行插红旗、树标兵以外，从政策上鼓励多种高产作物也是很必要的。有些地方采取按土质包产、按作物包工，多种高产作物就可多得报酬、多得奖励，从而激发群众多种高产作物的积极性。同时还应从资金、肥料、先进工具等物质方面，给予支持。
    今年不论是南方还是北方，都准备扩大高产作物的种植面积。这对完成今年的农业生产跃进指标，必将起着重大作用。特别是在春季里多种高产作物，又具有特殊重要的意义。因为春季对农作物生长极为有利，春播的高产作物，比夏种的产量高。如早稻比中稻一般要高10％以上，春甘薯比夏甘薯可增产60％，春玉米比夏玉米可以多收50％以上。在秋季易旱易涝的地区，春季多种高产作物，还能避开灾害，收成更为稳妥可靠。现在春耕播种已进入高潮，各地应抓紧大好春光，进一步深入广泛地发动群众，在春播中尽量多种高产作物，打下今年更大丰收的坚固基础。（附图片）
