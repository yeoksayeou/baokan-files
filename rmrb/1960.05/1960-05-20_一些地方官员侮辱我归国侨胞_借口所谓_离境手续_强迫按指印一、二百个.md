Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from Jakarta: Indonesian authorities in some regions, including the prosecutor's office and military authorities, are obstructing the return of overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to China due to loss of livelihood and persecution by forcing them to provide dozens or even over two hundred fingerprints.

As early as February 15th of this year, the Army's 7th Regiment in the Jakarta region of West Java issued instructions requiring all returning overseas Chinese to go to the National Security Bureau to provide fingerprints of all ten fingers, submit ten photos, fill out fifteen copies of various forms, and seven copies of baggage lists.

In some places, such as Cirebon and Subang, local authorities require overseas Chinese to sign twenty copies of the general form for returning overseas Chinese and to affix fingerprints to ten forms under the supervision of the county-level National Security Bureau. Each form requires eighteen fingerprints, totaling one hundred and eighty fingerprints, otherwise departure permits will not be issued.

This number of fingerprints is equivalent to the number of fingerprints required from deported criminals. In Surabaya, returning overseas Chinese were forced to provide two hundred and forty fingerprints.

The incident on April 27th, when the Riau Provincial Procuratorate forcibly hijacked the Chinese ship "Da Bao Kang," sent to Riau Province to transport returning overseas Chinese, back to Selat Panjang, was justified by the fact that these overseas Chinese had not provided seventy-two fingerprints. On April 27th, overseas Chinese returning from Samarinda on the ship "Hai Huang" were even held down and forced to provide one hundred fingerprints on five forms when completing return procedures.

This "departure procedure" of coercing an astonishing number of fingerprints is reminiscent of the situation during President Sukarno's visit to the United States in May 1956, when the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia required six Indonesian journalists accompanying Sukarno on his visit to the United States to provide ten fingerprints.

This uncivilized act by U.S. imperialism, which insulted the dignity of the people of Asian and African countries, once aroused great indignation and serious protests from Indonesian public opinion and the broad masses of the people.

    一些地方官员侮辱我归国侨胞
    借口所谓“离境手续”强迫按指印一、二百个
    新华社18日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚一些地区的检察当局和军事当局强迫那些因丧失生计和受到迫害而自愿归国的华侨按数十个以至二百多个手指印，来阻挠华侨归国。
    在西爪哇雅加达州的陆军第七团当局，早在今年2月15日就发布指示，规定要求归国的华侨都必须到国家安全局按上包括十个指头的手指印，交照片十张，填写各种表格十五份和行李清单七份。
    有些地方，如井里汶和苏横，地方当局要华侨在归国华侨总表格上签字二十份，还要在县一级国家安全局的监督下在十分表格上盖指印，每份盖十八个指印，即共盖手指印一百八十个，否则就不发给离境证。
    而这个指印数字是同被驱逐出境的人犯所要按的手印数是相等的。在泗水，归国华侨竟被迫要按手指印二百四十个。
    4月27日廖内省检察署用武力劫持中国派往廖内省接运归国华侨的轮船“大宝康号”驶回石叻班让的事件，就是以这批华侨未按七十二个指印为借口的。4月27日搭乘“海皇号”轮船从三马林达回国的华侨，在办理回国手续时，甚至被按住手强迫在五张表格上按一百个手指印。
    这种强迫按下数目惊人的指印的“离境手续”，令人回想起1956年5月苏加诺总统访问美国时的情况，当时美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆要六名随苏加诺访问美国的印度尼西亚记者按十个手指印。
    美帝国主义这种不文明的、侮辱亚非国家人民尊严的行为，曾经引起印度尼西亚舆论和广大人民的极大愤慨和严重抗议。
