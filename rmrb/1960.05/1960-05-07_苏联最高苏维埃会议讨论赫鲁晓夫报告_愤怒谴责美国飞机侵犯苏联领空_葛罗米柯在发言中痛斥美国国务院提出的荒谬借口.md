Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 6th: The fifth session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union continued on the afternoon of May 5th in the Great Kremlin Palace to discuss Khrushchev's report on "Abolishing Taxes on Workers and Employees."

The Chairman of the session, P. P. Peive, Chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, said that the meeting had received a large number of telegrams from various collectives and individual citizens across the country, expressing full support for the bill to abolish taxes. They expressed gratitude to the Party and the government for the new concern for the welfare of the working people. Peive also read telegrams from workers and employees in many cities.

The first speaker at the meeting was Kalchenko, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian Republic. He said that this session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union would go down in history as another evidence of the Communist Party and the Soviet government's concern for improving the welfare of the people. He said that as a result of the implementation of the bill to abolish taxes, the wages of workers and employees in Ukraine would increase by nine billion rubles.

Representative Kalchenko condemned the aggressive actions of the US military against the Soviet Union. He said, "American aircraft shamelessly and piratically intruded into the Soviet border, which aroused great indignation among the Ukrainian people. The purpose of the United States is to obstruct the easing of international tensions."

The speech of Strouev, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federal Republic, focused on the prospects for developing the production of consumer goods in connection with the bill to abolish taxes. He emphasized that all Soviet people and every Soviet family would feel the concern of the Communist Party and the government for improving the people's living standards anytime and anywhere.

Representative Strouev said that in June, Eisenhower would visit the Soviet Union. There is no doubt that he will be given due hospitality. This president will have to answer many questions raised by our people, such as, if American planes intrude into Soviet territory, "if a friend robs a neighbor," how should friendship be understood?

Representative Tashenev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh Republic, said that only a socialist country that is successfully building communism can implement such remarkable measures as the abolition of taxes on workers and employees. He pointed out that no capitalist country can take such a step.

Tashenev emphasized that the abolition of taxes is the result of the entire historical development of the Soviet Union and its consistently high economic growth. He said that the output of Kazakh industrial products has increased forty times compared with 1913. The republic's current power generation capacity exceeds the power generation capacity of the entire Russia before the revolution.

Representative Tashenev continued: The Soviet armed forces will resolutely repulse any provocative attacks from any place in the future.

Kiselev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Belorussian Republic, said that all villages and most cities in the republic were destroyed during the last World War, and the working people of the republic fully support the Soviet government's peace-loving policy.

Spiridonov (Leningrad), a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, said that those who attempt to subject the people of the world to the disasters of war again should take the lessons of World War II as a serious warning. He emphasized that all mankind cannot tolerate such a situation when the Bonn revanchists may put the whole world in the flames of war.

Spiridonov spoke with extreme anger about the provocative flights of American aircraft. He said that the intrusion of American aircraft into Soviet airspace aroused particular indignation among Soviet citizens. This incident happened two weeks before the start of the Paris Conference, and its purpose was to oppose the summit meeting.

When Representative Bekov, a worker from the large industrial center of the Urals in the Russian Federation, spoke, he said to Khrushchev that your position at the Paris Conference will not only be supported by the Soviet people, but also by the entire peace-loving mankind.

Bekov said that we demand that the planners of the provocative flights of American aircraft over Soviet territory be severely punished. We warn those countries that allow American aircraft to take off there for adventurous flights.

Bekov said, "These flights show what the purpose of establishing military bases by the United States on the territory of other countries is, and how."

The meeting on the 5th ended here.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 6th: The fifth session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union continued on the morning of May 6th.

Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko spoke at the meeting. He said that in recent years, there have been significant positive changes in the international situation, which is the result of the active struggle of the forces of peace, especially the socialist camp countries.

Gromyko said that the Soviet Union believes it has a duty to eliminate the remnants of World War II, including the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the abolition of the occupation of West Berlin. Some people attempt to describe the Soviet Union's policy towards Germany as a policy of threats and ultimatums, which is groundless. The Soviet Union's policy is to sincerely hope to adapt the situation in Germany and West Berlin to the current situation.

Gromyko said that it might be useful to say it again to some hotheads in the West that the borders of the German Democratic Republic are as solid as a rock. When necessary, the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Treaty member states will fully protect this border.

Speaking of the work of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee, Gromyko pointed out that the Geneva talks did not make any contribution to the conclusion of a disarmament agreement. Our negotiating partners once again exposed themselves as enemies of disarmament.

Gromyko emphasized that the Soviet Union will continue to patiently seek ways for the major powers to reach a disarmament agreement.

The Soviet Foreign Minister said that the upcoming summit meeting in Paris "will be a true test of the intentions of Western countries."

Gromyko said that the US State Department has just announced that the reason why an American plane intruded into Soviet airspace on May 1 was because the pilot lost consciousness. The Foreign Minister pointed out that this statement is absurd. We want to ask the US State Department this question: how is it that American pilots have opened fire on Soviet aircraft more than once after intruding into our airspace (and we have pointed this out to the US government more than once)? Did they all lose consciousness as well?

Gromyko went on to say, can we believe that American flight crews, whose purpose is to invade the Soviet Union, lost consciousness while flying over the Soviet border and continued to fly the plane, even able to shoot? Gromyko said that this is indeed a new problem in medicine.

Gromyko said that those responsible for this action are obviously in confusion and do not know how to deal with it.

Gromyko said that the Soviet government has not given up the hope that the Paris Conference will lead to the results expected by the people of all countries, will lead to a further easing of tensions, and will establish greater trust among the people of all countries.

Gromyko said that there are still many advocates of the "Cold War" and the arms race. As the date of the summit meeting approaches, they will probably act like Dulles did in many occasions. As before, their position is very simple: even if Dulles and his policies no longer exist in the world, then another Dulles should be created.

The Foreign Minister emphasized that the Soviet government is aware of all the responsibilities borne by the leaders of the four major powers. The tense gaze of every corner of the world will be cast on Paris. The Soviet government will do its best to promote the success of the meeting. At the same time, it hopes that other participants in the meeting will do the same.

Soviet Marshal Grechko said that he believes that the US plane's violation of the Soviet border is a "shameful fact." He said that it is especially infuriating that this violation occurred on the eve of the summit meeting when there has been some easing of international tensions.

Marshal Grechko said that the American aircraft that invaded Soviet airspace on "May Day" was hit by the first rocket launched by the Soviet Union. He went on to say that the Soviet armed forces are equipped with such excellent weapons - rockets.

Marshal Grechko pointed out that the US plane's intrusion into Soviet airspace was an attempt to reconnoiter the Soviet Union's defense situation and the Soviet armed forces' state of alert.

Marshal Grechko continued that the Soviet military personnel gloriously fulfilled the orders of the Soviet government. The Marshal said, let the aggressors know that we have enough rockets.

Marshal Grechko recounted the various military exercises that the West is now holding, saying: "Gentlemen, rest assured, we do not intend to attack anyone. We do not need other people's wealth. We love peace and communist labor the most."

The Marshal pointed out that the imperialists have imposed wars on the Soviet Union in the past, but they have not been able to destroy and will not be able to destroy the fighting spirit of the Soviet people in the past and in the future.

Grechko said that we are now implementing the decision of the Fourth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on substantially reducing the Soviet armed forces, but we have not forgotten national defense in the slightest. The strength of our army is constantly growing. Rocket forces have become a major form of armed forces and have become a separate service with its own headquarters. Marshal Grechko said that as long as a decision on comprehensive and thorough disarmament has not been adopted, the Soviet military personnel will resolutely and bravely crush the conspiracies of military adventurers.

Representative Serdyuk said at the meeting that the Moldavian Republic has undergone a real cultural revolution. The republic now has sixty-five university students for every 10,000 residents, which is more than Italy, France, and West Germany. The republic has more physicians for every 10,000 residents than the United States, Britain, France, and Japan.

Serdyuk emphasized that all these achievements are the result of Lenin's national policy.

Representative Ulzhabayev (Tajik) said that the bill on abolishing taxes on workers and employees proposed by the Soviet government is a concrete manifestation of the decision of the 21st Congress of the CPSU on improving the welfare of the Soviet people.

Representative Bairamov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Turkmenistan, emphasized that the entire Turkmen people support the bill on abolishing taxes on workers and employees.

He went on to say that the provocative act of the American aircraft is complicating the situation before the Paris summit meeting.

Armenian representative, the famous Soviet astrophysicist Ambartsumian, said that the passage of the Employee Tax Exemption Act "will be a new and giant step forward in further improving the material welfare of the Soviet working people."

    苏联最高苏维埃会议讨论赫鲁晓夫报告
    愤怒谴责美国飞机侵犯苏联领空
    葛罗米柯在发言中痛斥美国国务院提出的荒谬借口
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议，5日下午在大克里姆林宫继续举行，讨论赫鲁晓夫作的“取消工人和职员赋税”的报告。
    会议执行主席、苏联最高苏维埃民族院主席佩维说，会议收到了来自全国各个集体和个别公民的大批的电报，表示完全拥护取消赋税的法案。他们对党和政府对劳动人民福利的新的关怀表示感激。佩维还宣读了许多城市的工人和职员来的电报。
    在会上第一个发言的是乌克兰共和国部长会议主席卡尔钦科。他说，这次苏联最高苏维埃会议将作为共产党和苏联政府关怀人民福利的提高的又一证据而载入史册。他说，由于实现取消赋税的法案，乌克兰的工人和职员的工资将增加九十亿卢布。
    卡尔钦科代表谴责了美国军人对苏联的侵略行动。他说，“美国飞机无耻地、强盗式地侵入苏联边界，引起了乌克兰人民的极大愤怒，美国的目的在于阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和。”
    俄罗斯联邦共和国部长会议副主席斯特鲁耶夫代表的发言是就取消赋税的法案谈发展消费品的生产的前景问题。他着重指出，全体苏联人民和每一个苏联的家庭都会随时随地感到共产党和政府对提高人民的生活水平的关怀。
    斯特鲁耶夫代表说，在6月份，艾森豪威尔就要到苏联来访问。毫无疑问，他将受到应有的款待。这位总统将要回答我国人民提出的许多问题，譬如，如果美国的飞机侵入苏联的领土，“如果朋友抢劫邻居”，那么友谊须作如何理解呢？
    哈萨克共和国部长会议主席塔谢涅夫代表说，只有顺利地建设共产主义的社会主义国家，才能实现像取消工人和职员赋税这样卓越的措施。他指出，任何一个资本主义国家都不能采取这样的步骤。
    塔谢涅夫着重指出，取消赋税是苏联历史发展的整个过程和它的经济一贯高涨的结果。他说，哈萨克工业产品的产量同1913年相比，增加了四十倍。共和国现在的发电能力超过了革命前整个俄国的发电能力。
    塔谢涅夫代表接着说：苏联的武装部队今后对来自任何地方的任何挑衅性的进攻都将给予坚决的回击。
    白俄罗斯共和国部长会议主席基谢廖夫发言说，这个共和国在前次世界大战期间所有的村庄和大部分城市被破坏了，共和国的劳动人民完全拥护苏联政府的爱好和平的政策。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员斯皮里多诺夫（列宁格勒）说，那些企图重新使世界人民遭受战争灾难的人们应该把第二次世界大战的教训当作一个严正的警告。他着重指出，当波恩复仇主义分子可能把全世界置于战争炮火中去的时候，全人类是不能容忍这种事态的。
    斯皮里多诺夫极其愤怒地谈到了美国飞机的挑衅性的飞行。他说，美国飞机对苏联领空的侵犯，引起了苏联公民的特别愤怒。这件事发生在巴黎会议开始前的两周里，其目的是反对最高级会议。
    俄罗斯联邦的大工业中心乌拉尔的工人贝科夫代表发言时对赫鲁晓夫说，您在巴黎会议上的立场不仅会得到苏联人民的支持，而且会得到整个爱好和平的人类的支持。
    贝科夫说，我们要求严厉惩办美国飞机在苏联领土上空进行挑衅性飞行的策划者。我们警告那些允许美国飞机在那里起飞进行冒险飞行的国家。
    贝科夫说，“这些飞行表明了美国在别国领土上建立军事基地是为了什么，其目的如何。”
    5日的会议到此结束。
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科6日讯：苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议6日上午继续举行。
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在会议上发言。他说，近几年国际局势有了显著的良好变化，这是和平力量、首先是社会主义阵营各国积极斗争的结果。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联认为自己有职责消除第二次世界大战的残余，其中包括缔结对德和约和取消对西柏林的占领。有人企图把苏联对德政策说成是威胁和最后通牒的政策，这是没有任何根据的。苏联的政策是真诚地希望使德国和西柏林局势与当前形势相适应。
    葛罗米柯说，对西方某些头脑发热的人不妨再说一遍，德意志民主共和国的疆界固若金汤。在必要时，苏联和华沙条约参加国将全力保护这个疆界。
    在谈到十国裁军委员会的工作时，葛罗米柯指出，日内瓦谈判没有对缔结裁军协定作出任何贡献。我们谈判的对方再一次暴露出自己是裁军的敌人。
    葛罗米柯强调指出，苏联今后仍将耐心地寻求大国达成裁军协定的途径。
    苏联外交部长说，即将在巴黎举行的政府首脑会议“将是对西方国家意图的真正考验”。
    葛罗米柯说，美国国务院刚才宣布说什么5月1日美国飞机侵入苏联领空是因为飞行员失去了知觉。外交部长指出，这种说法是荒谬的。我们要向美国国务院提出这样一个问题：美国飞行员不止一次地在侵入我国领空后向苏联飞机开火（我们也不止一次地向美国政府指出过这一点）是怎么回事呢？难道他们也都失去了知觉吗？
    葛罗米柯接着说，难道我们能够相信，旨在侵犯苏联的美国飞行队员在飞越苏联边境时丧失了知觉并在这种情况下继续驾驶飞机甚至能够射击吗？葛罗米柯说，这倒真是医学上的新问题了。
    葛罗米柯说，对这种行动负有责任的人明显地陷入了混乱，并且不知道应该如何应付。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联政府并未放弃这种希望，即巴黎会议将导致各国人民所期待的成果，将导致紧张局势的进一步缓和，将建立各国人民之间的很大的信任。
    葛罗米柯说，“冷战”和军备竞赛的鼓吹者还大有人在。随着举行最高级会议的日期越来越近，他们在许多场合下大概会像往日杜勒斯那样行事。和从前一样，他们的立场很简单：即使世界上已不存在杜勒斯和他的政策，那末就应该再制造一个杜勒斯。
    外交部长着重指出，苏联政府意识到四大国领导人所承担的全部责任。世界各个角落的紧张视线都将投向巴黎。苏联政府将尽全力促使会议取得成就。同时，它希望会议其他参加国也能这样作。
    苏联元帅格列奇科说，他认为，美国飞机侵犯苏联国境是“可耻的事实”。他说，尤其令人愤恨的是，这种侵犯行为发生在最高级会议前夕国际紧张局势有了某种缓和的情况下。
    格列奇科元帅说，在“五一”侵入苏联领空的美国飞机被苏联发射的第一支火箭就命中了。他接着说，苏联武装部队就是用这种卓越的武器——火箭装备的。
    格列奇科元帅指出，美国飞机侵入苏联领空是企图侦察苏联国防情况和苏联武装部队的戒备情况。
    格列奇科元帅接着说，苏联军人光荣地履行了苏联政府的命令。元帅说，让侵略者知道知道，我们是拥有足够的火箭的。
    格列奇科元帅追述了西方现在所举行的各种军事演习，他说：“先生们，放心吧，我们不打算进攻谁。我们不需要别人的财富。我们最热爱和平和共产主义劳动。”
    元帅指出，帝国主义者过去曾把战争强加给苏联，但是他们过去和将来都不能摧毁苏联人民的斗志。
    格列奇科说，我们现在正在执行苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议关于大量裁减苏联武装部队的决定，但是我们丝毫没有忘记国防。我们军队的实力不断增长。火箭部队成了武装部队的一种主要形式，并且单独成为一个兵种，有其自己的司令部。格列奇科元帅说，只要还没有通过全面彻底裁军决议，苏联军人就将坚决勇敢地粉碎军事冒险者的阴谋。
    谢尔久克代表在会上发言时说，摩尔达维亚共和国进行了真正的文化革命。共和国现在每一万居民当中就有六十五个大学生，比意大利、法国和西德都要多。共和国每一万居民中所有的医师，比美国、英国、法国、日本都要多。
    谢尔久克着重指出，所有这一切成就都是列宁民族政策的成果。
    乌尔扎巴耶夫代表（塔吉克）说，苏联政府提出的关于取消职工赋税的法案，是苏共第二十一次代表大会关于提高苏联人民福利的决议的具体表现。
    土库曼最高苏维埃主席团主席拔伊腊莫夫代表着重指出，全体土库曼人民都拥护关于取消职工赋税的法案。
    他接着说，美国飞机的挑衅行为是在巴黎最高级会议之前使局势复杂化。
    亚美尼亚代表、苏联著名天体物理学家阿姆巴楚米扬说，职工免税法案的通过“将是在进一步提高苏联劳动人民物质福利方面向前迈出的新的巨大的一步”。
