Eight Million Wu Song Take Their Posts

\tShandong Qingdao, Chu Tianshu

\tDrought has appeared in Shandong Province, and eight million heroes are bravely taking to the field, fighting the spring drought and protecting the summer harvest, ordering ten thousand waters to return to the fields to irrigate the land, fully demonstrating the spirit and style of Wu Song fighting the tiger on Jingyang Ridge, but a hundred times more awe-inspiring than that tiger-fighting hero! How do I know? There are news reports to prove it:

\t“People's communes in various places have quickly mobilized their forces and adopted the method of using 'five groups' and 'six waters' together to rush to irrigate spring fields... Gates are opened in rivers everywhere, water is released from reservoirs everywhere, machines are mobilized together, machines are roaring, vehicles and horses are bustling, and more than 30 million mu of wheat have been irrigated throughout the province, an increase of fourteen times over the same period last year..."

\tThe "five groups" here refer to mechanical groups, waterwheel groups, water dipper groups, winch groups, and double-bucket-lift groups; the "six waters" means that water sources such as rivers, reservoirs, canals, wells, springs, and pools are fully utilized. The heroes fighting the drought have set up the array of "five groups" and "six waters." There are several particularly shining golden words here, namely "mechanical groups" and "waterwheel groups," "gates are opened in rivers everywhere, water is released from reservoirs everywhere, machines are mobilized together, machines are roaring." May I ask: How can machines form groups? How can waterwheels form arrays? Where do the large reservoirs in the plains come from? How do rivers have sluice gates? Looking at the four shining golden characters "People's Commune," the answer is immediately revealed.

\tWhat is said here is only Shandong, and only Shandong's fight against drought. Looking at the whole country, the infinite beautiful scenery can never be fully described. The drought is like a tiger, and Wu Song, the tiger-fighting hero, will never let it go lightly.

    八百万武松上岗
    山东青岛　楚天舒
    山东省出现旱象，八百万英雄奋勇上阵，抗春旱，保夏收，喝令万水归田浇地，十足表现了武松在景阳岗上打虎的气派和风格，但比那打虎英雄却又威风百倍！怎见得？有新闻报道为证：
    “各地人民公社迅速调集力量，并采取‘五群’‘六水’齐用的办法赶浇春田……。各地河河开闸，库库放水，机具齐动，机器轰鸣，车水马龙，全省已有三千多万亩小麦灌了水，比去年同期增加十四倍……”
    这里的“五群”指的是机械群、水车群、水斗群、辘轳群、鸳鸯罐群；“六水”是把河、库、渠、井、泉、汪等水源都充分利用起来。抗旱的英雄，大摆起了“五群”“六水”之阵。这里有几个特别闪着光的金色字眼，那就是“机械群”和“水车群”、“河河开闸，库库放水，机具齐动，机器轰鸣”。请问：机械何以会成群？水车何以能摆阵？平原哪里来的大水库？河河何由现闸门？再看看那四个光芒万丈斗大的金字“人民公社”，谜底一下子就揭出来了。
    这里说的只是山东，也只是山东的抗旱。放眼观全国，无限大好风光就永远也没法说完了。旱象如虎，打虎英雄的武松绝不肯把它轻轻放过。
