    “Symposium on the Evaluation of Confucius”
    Not long ago, the History Research Institute of the Shandong Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a symposium in Jinan on the evaluation of Confucius, attended by more than 300 people. The discussion generally focused on the following four questions: 1. The era in which Confucius lived and the class he represented; on this question, opinions varied greatly due to the unresolved debate on the periodization of ancient history. 2. The role of Confucius's thought at that time. Participants generally agreed that Confucius's political thought had both advanced and backward aspects. Most comrades believed that the dominant aspect was progressive, which promoted the development of society at that time. There were three reasons for this: 1. Confucius was not an absolute restorationist. He superficially wanted to restore the "rites" of the Duke of Zhou, but in reality, he yearned for the unified situation of the Western Zhou Dynasty. 2. Confucius did not oppose all the progressive social phenomena that appeared at that time. He said that "expanding the Duke's chambers and suppressing private gates" aimed to create a unified situation that would be conducive to social development. His opposition to the casting of penal tripods in Jin was a demand for rulers to implement "benevolent governance" and "rule by virtue" to alleviate class contradictions. 3. Confucius's "benevolence" theory reflected the requirements of the new politics and new economy and conformed to the trend of social development. 3. Why did Confucius's thought become the guiding ideology of the feudal ruling class throughout Chinese history? Comrades who argued that Confucius represented the interests of the landlord class explained this from the interrelationship between the economic base and the superstructure. Comrades who argued that Confucius represented the interests of slave owners or the aristocratic class believed that the hierarchical system advocated by Confucius also conformed to the interests of the landlord class, and at the same time, Confucius's great achievements in cultural and educational history were admired by landlord class intellectuals. Comrades who advocated feudalism during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods believed that Confucius's thought was the product of the combination of some enlightened slave-owning aristocrats and emerging forces at the end of the slave system. 4. Confucius's educational thought and view of the natural order.

    “关于孔子评价”的讨论会
    不久以前，科学院山东分院历史研究所在济南召开了关于孔子评价问题的讨论会，参加讨论的有三百多人。讨论大体集中在如下四个问题上：一、孔子所处的时代及代表的阶级；这个问题，由于古史分期问题争论未决，因而意见很不一致。二、孔子的思想在当时所起的作用。与会者一致认为，孔子的政治思想具有先进和落后二重性。多数同志认为，主导面是进步的，它促进了当时社会的发展。理由有三：1，孔子不是绝对的复古主义者。他表面上想恢复周公之“礼”，实际上是向往西周大一统的局面；2，孔子对当时出现的社会进步现象，并不一概反对，他说“张公室，抑私门”目的是希望出现统一的局面，有利于社会发展。他反对晋铸刑鼎，是要求统治者实施“仁政”“德治”，以缓和阶级矛盾，3，孔子的“仁学”理论，反映了新政治、新经济的要求，符合社会发展的趋势。三、孔子的思想何以成为中国历代封建统治阶级的指导思想？主张孔子代表地主阶级利益的同志，从基础和上层建筑的互相关系中作了解释。主张孔子代表奴隶主或贵族阶级利益的同志认为孔子所提倡的等级制度也符合于地主阶级的利益，同时孔子在文化教育史上的伟大功绩为地主阶级知识分子所崇拜。主张春秋战国之际封建论的同志则认为孔子思想是奴隶制末期一部分开明奴隶主贵族和新兴势力互相结合的产物。四、孔子的教育思想和天道观。
