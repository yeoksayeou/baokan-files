　　Jilin Basically Completes Spring Planting Plan

　　Jilin has basically completed its spring planting plan. According to statistics on May 20th, the province has completed 95% of its planned dry land sowing area. Currently, rice transplanting, seedling inspection and replanting, hoeing, and topdressing are being carried out successively.

　　Early action, more planting, fast progress, and good planting are the main characteristics of this year's spring plowing and sowing in Jilin. This year, all localities have adapted to local conditions and planted early and timely. Baicheng, Siping, Changchun and other regions began planting wheat in mid-March. By mid-April, the province generally began sowing large fields. During sowing, all localities focused on five measures to increase production: meticulous land preparation, seed treatment, rational close planting, improved sowing techniques, and increased application of manure.

　　Inner Mongolia Completes Planting of Field Crops Ahead of Schedule

　　Inner Mongolia's field crop planting work has basically ended at the time of Lesser Fullness (solar term), one solar term earlier than last year. By May 17th, the region had completed more than 73% of the total planting plan, 18 million mu more than the same period last year. More than 90% of field crops have been planted. Following the over-fulfillment of the spring wheat planting task by 10%, various major grain crops such as corn, sorghum, and millet have also over-fulfilled their planting plans. Now, farmers of all ethnic groups in the region are advancing victoriously, striving to plant late-season crops ahead of schedule to achieve early planting and high yields; and are investing a large amount of labor and livestock power into the land reclamation movement, continuing to expand the planting area by reclaiming land, leveling the land, and sowing seeds at the same time.

　　Shaanxi Launches Mass Movement to Plant Scattered Plots

　　Commune members in various parts of Shaanxi are vigorously tapping the potential of scattered plots of land and widely planting crops such as pumpkins and vegetables. According to incomplete statistics from Xi'an City and nine counties including Shangluo, Hanzhong, Ankang prefectures and Qianxian County, 1.08 million mu of scattered land have been utilized by the 16th, most of which have been planted with various melons and vegetables.

　　In the spring planting, various places have created many clever ways to fully utilize the potential of scattered and small plots of land. For example, the Caijiapo Commune in Fengxiang County plants climbing crops such as cowpeas under the trees, which not only does not take up land but also yields more cowpeas. They also deepened the canals and narrowed the edges, planting sunflowers on both sides of the canals and melons and beans below, which not only yielded beans and melons but also reduced the evaporation of canal water.

　　Hubei Reforms Tools to Welcome Summer Harvest

　　Hubei Province is vigorously carrying out the reform of threshing and processing tools for summer harvest crops to welcome the summer bumper harvest.

　　Hubei Province has a large area of summer harvest crops this year, and the crops are growing well. The summer harvest task is heavy. In addition to making labor arrangements, all localities are focusing on the reform of threshing and processing tools. Xiangyang Prefecture organized more than 6,000 iron, wood, and stonemasons to go to the countryside to help production teams vigorously reform stone rollers and hydraulic and power threshing tools. At present, stone rollers with ball bearings have been widely promoted throughout the prefecture, increasing work efficiency by three times and saving a lot of labor and animal power. The region has newly manufactured and reformed 410,000 new-style agricultural tools for threshing, harvesting, and deep plowing. The counties of Jingzhou Prefecture have improved and newly manufactured more than 11,000 pieces of summer grain processing tools, basically achieving two improved processing tools for each production team.

　　Guangxi Seizes Peak Season to Collect Pine Resin

　　Guangxi is seizing the peak season for resin tapping, combining it with current production, and organizing labor in a timely manner to collect pine resin to support industrial construction. Up to the beginning of May, incomplete statistics from only five prefectures of Wuzhou, Liuzhou, Guilin, Yulin, and Nanning showed that more than 13,000 people had been organized to collect more than 177,000 jin of pine resin.

　　Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Celebrates Lamb Harvest

　　The Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu Province is celebrating a bumper lamb harvest. Last winter and this spring, the total number of lambs produced in the prefecture increased by about 50% compared to the same period last year, and the survival rate increased by 20%. Since last autumn, the six people's communes and one stud farm in Maqu area of Taojiang County have built sheds and prepared forage grass, changing the traditional habit of not building sheds and not storing grass, so that the sheep could safely overwinter and were fat and strong. The Oula People's Commune adjusted the ewe flock, strengthened grazing, and also established a special organization for receiving and raising lambs during the lambing season, launching a red flag competition for "100 ewes, 100 lambs," and "100 births, 100 survival."

    要闻快报
    吉林春播基本完成计划
    吉林春播已基本完成计划。据5月20日统计，全省旱田播种面积已完成计划的95％。目前，水田插秧、查苗补种、铲趟和追肥等生产活动，正陆续展开。
    动手早，种的多，进度快，种的好，是今年吉林春耕播种的主要特色。各地今年都因地因时制宜地提前适时早种。白城、四平、长春等地区在3月中旬就开始种植小麦。到4月中旬全省就普遍开始播种大田。播种中，各地狠抓细致整地、种子处理、合理密植、提高播种技术、增施粪肥等五项增产措施。
  内蒙古提前完成大田作物播种
    内蒙古大田作物播种工作已在小满基本结束，比去年提前一个节气。到5月17日，全区已经完成总播种计划的73％以上，比去年同时期多种了一千八百万亩，大田作物已播种90％以上，继春小麦超额10％完成播种任务之后，玉米、高粱、谷子等各种主要粮食作物也都超额完成播种计划，现在，全区各族农民正在乘胜前进，力争将晚田作物提前播种，使它早种多产；并将大批劳力和畜力投入了开荒运动，以边开荒、边平整土地、边播种的办法继续扩大播种面积。
    陕西开展全民种零星地运动
    陕西各地公社社员大力挖掘零星土地的潜力，广种南瓜、蔬菜等作物。据西安市和商雒、汉中、安康专区以及乾县等九个县的不完全统计，到16日已利用零星土地一百零八万亩，其中大都种植了各种瓜菜。
    各地在小春播中，创造了许多充分发挥零星小块土地潜力的巧办法。如凤翔县蔡家坡公社，在树下种上菜豆角等攀缘作物，既不占地，还能多结豆角。他们还把渠道加深，渠边缩窄，在渠道两边种上向日葵，下面种上瓜豆，不但可收豆、瓜，还减少了渠水蒸发量。
