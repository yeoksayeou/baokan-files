Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, May 26th. Since May 21st, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis in Chile have caused severe disasters. It is estimated that at least 5,000 people have died. Some have been officially identified, but the whereabouts of many missing persons are unknown.

Earthquakes occurred continuously from May 21st to May 25th. "Ultima Hora" believes that the earthquake has actually changed the topography of Chile, with some volcanoes appearing and some islands sinking.

In the entire coastal region, some towns from the province of Concepción to the province of Chiloé have disappeared due to earthquakes and tsunamis. According to "El Siglo", sixteen cities, including Lebu, Quidico, and Tirúa, have disappeared, and the losses suffered are still impossible to calculate, but they cannot be less than one billion pesos. Several kilometers of the southern coast of Llanquihue Province have completely sunk.

More than ten provinces across Chile have been affected by the earthquake. The earthquake that erupted on May 21st particularly affected the province of Concepción, where there are important factories, such as paper mills, glass plate factories, United Breweries, several textile factories, and coal mines. It is estimated that at least 300 people died in the province, and 60% of the buildings were destroyed. The earthquake on May 22nd, which caused the tsunami, was the most intense and affected a vast area, including the provinces of Cautín, Valdivia, Llanquihue, Osorno, and Chiloé, which suffered severe losses.

At the call of the United Workers' Confederation of Chile and other organizations, a relief movement for the victims has been rapidly launched, and relief efforts are also underway worldwide. The first aircraft sent by the Cuban government carrying food arrived in Santiago on May 26th.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 28th. According to TASS: The recent earthquake in Chile has also affected Kamchatka in the Soviet Union, more than 10,000 kilometers away.

On May 27th, when the effects of the Chilean earthquake reached the Kamchatka coast, the sea level fluctuated by 1.5 to 2 meters, and in the bays, the fluctuation ranged from 3 to 4.8 meters. In some places, the seawater receded 100 to 300 meters, exposing the seabed.

Local residents, having received timely forecasts, took all defensive measures and suffered no damage.

According to the Soviet meteorological measurement department, the earthquake in Chile has caused fluctuations across the entire Pacific Ocean. As of May 27th, it was still continuing but gradually weakening.

Kamchatka is 16,200 kilometers away from the epicenter of the Chilean earthquake. This is the first time on record that Kamchatka has been affected by an earthquake occurring in the Southern Hemisphere.

    智利地震造成严重灾害
    死亡者至少五千人　一些岛屿和城市已消失
    新华社圣地亚哥26日电　21日以来，智利地震、火山爆发和海啸造成了严重灾害。据估计，死亡的人数至少有五千人。有一部分人官方已经查明，但还有很多失踪者的下落不明。
    地震从21日到25日连续发生。“最后一点钟报”认为，地震实际上改变了智利的地形，一些火山出现了，一些岛屿沉没了。
    在整个沿海地区，从公塞普森省到济罗省有些城镇由于地震和海啸而消失了。据“世纪报”报道，消失的城市有利科、基迪科、蒂鲁亚等十六个，所遭到的损失还无法统计，但是不可能少于十亿比索。扬基乌埃省几公里长的南海岸全部沉没了。
    智利全国十多个省受到了这次地震的影响。21日爆发的地震特别影响了公塞普森省，在那里有重要的工厂，例如，造纸厂、玻璃板厂、联合啤酒厂、几个纺织工厂和煤矿等。估计全省至少死亡三百人，60％的建筑物被毁。引起海啸的22日的地震最为强烈，而且波及到广大的地区，包括考丁、瓦尔的维亚、扬基乌埃、奥索尔诺和济罗等省损失严重。
    在智利工人统一工会和其他组织的号召下，救济受难者的运动迅速地开展起来了，救济运动也在世界范围内展开了。古巴政府派遣的运送食物的第一架飞机26日已飞抵圣地亚哥。
    新华社莫斯科28日电　据塔斯社报道：智利最近发生地震，远在一万多公里以外的苏联堪察加也受到了影响。
    27日，智利地震的影响传到堪察加沿海岸时，海平面波动幅度达一米半到两米，而在海湾里波动幅度达三米到四点八米。有些地方海水后退了一百米到三百米，露出了海底。
    当地居民由于及时得到了预报，采取了一切防御措施，并未受到任何损害。
    据苏联的气象测量部门宣称智利的地震使整个太平洋的水面，都受到了波动。到27日为止，仍在继续，但正在逐渐减弱中。
    堪察加距智利地震中心达一万六千二百公里。这是堪察加有记录以来第一次受到在南半球发生的地震的影响。
