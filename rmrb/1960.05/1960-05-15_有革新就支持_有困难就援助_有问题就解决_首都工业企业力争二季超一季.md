Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    Support innovation, aid difficulties, solve problems. Capital industrial enterprises strive to surpass the first quarter in the second quarter.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, "Exceed April in May, surpass the first quarter in the second quarter, and strive to complete half of the annual plan in the first half of the year." This is the fighting goal proposed by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China at the industrial and transportation five-level cadre meeting held from May 5th to 7th. This meeting summarized and exchanged the rich experiences of the city's technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation, and discussed the issue of striving to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

    Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the meeting and delivered an important speech. Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a report at the meeting.

    The technological innovation and technological revolution movement on the capital's industrial and transportation front has recently undergone new developments in terms of scale and content. In many industries and enterprises, the face of production is changing day by day, even several times a day. The high tide of the technological revolution has brought about a comprehensive leap forward in production. Since the beginning of this year, production has risen month by month, and the state plan has been overfulfilled every month. The city's total industrial output value increased by 11% in February compared to January, 15% in March compared to February, and another 8% in April compared to March. The quality of most products has remained stable or continued to improve, and production efficiency has increased rapidly. So far, the city's industrial and transportation departments have drawn more than 26,000 employees to support new and expanded units.

    The meeting pointed out that the fundamental reason for the great victory of technological innovation and technological revolution is that the mass line of Marxism-Leninism was implemented in the movement, and under the centralized leadership of the Party, all work of the enterprise, systematic technological transformation, and the application of the latest technology were all boldly handed over to the masses to handle. As a result, hundreds of thousands of people have invested in the torrent of technological innovation and technological revolution, everyone expressing opinions, making suggestions, building machines, conducting experiments, combining indigenous and foreign methods, using foreign methods when possible, and using indigenous methods when appropriate, with a hundred flowers blooming and a riot of color. Party secretaries, factory directors, workers, technicians, management personnel, service personnel, university professors, students, government cadres, military officers and soldiers, and even residents of the streets, all worked together. Countless heroic figures emerged in the movement. The meeting pointed out that the high degree of enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers shows that the Party's mass line has undergone new and major developments on the basis of past large-scale mass movements, and more and more cadres have understood or learned to apply the mass line in economic construction. This is a great victory for the Party's mass line in the struggle for production. The meeting called on all employees to unswervingly implement this Marxist-Leninist line in the future.

    The meeting praised the thousands upon thousands of "innovation enthusiasts" who emerged in this movement, pointing out that the reason why the broad masses of workers were engaged in creative labor in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, racing against time and disregarding remuneration, was because they adhered to putting politics in command and established the ambition of the proletariat under the education of the Party, and had a strong desire to rapidly change the poor and blank face of the motherland. Therefore, they showed a heroic spirit of daring to scale any height and overcome any difficulty in the movement. The meeting requested that leading cadres at all levels cherish this revolutionary vigor of the masses, and to support innovation, aid difficulties, remind of oversights, and solve problems. The more the masses are engaged in selfless labor regardless of their personal safety, the more the leaders must be very concerned about the lives of the masses, comprehensively and properly arrange the work and rest, study and life of the employees, pay attention to streamlining meetings; pay close attention to safe production, do a good job in heatstroke prevention and summer hygiene, and carry out sports activities; raise pigs and grow vegetables, and run canteens well; properly arrange theoretical and cultural studies, and combine work and rest, so as to ensure the continued leap forward in production.

    The meeting pointed out that the close combination of theory and practice is another remarkable feature of this movement. The "three-way combination" working method that emerged in the Great Leap Forward has been further developed. Now there is not only the "three-way combination" within the factory, that is, the combination of leading cadres, workers, and technicians under the leadership of the Party committee, but also the "three-way combination" of factories, universities, and research institutions, as well as the "three-way combination" of design departments, manufacturing departments, and user departments. These "three-way combinations" have promoted the great development of production and have also enabled the new development of scientific and technological theory. Now, the broad masses of workers who have been tempered in production practice are eagerly striving to improve their cultural and technical level, rapidly mastering scientific and technological theoretical knowledge, and creatively applying it widely in production practice. Tens of thousands of technicians, university teachers and students, and research and design personnel have gone to factories to participate in the technological revolution. They earnestly learn from the workers and fight alongside them, tempering themselves in the fire of labor and mass movements. This close combination of theory and practice is of utmost importance for promoting the development of technological revolution movements and teaching and scientific research work. The current task is to quickly summarize and study the extremely rich new experiences and new technologies created by the masses, systematize them, concentrate the new experiences of the masses, develop and create new scientific and technological theories, so that theory can return to practice and further guide production practice, and more powerfully promote the continued leap forward in production.

    The meeting emphasized that the technological innovation and technological revolution movement currently underway is a revolutionary movement of rapid and vigorous development. The situation is developing very fast, and "one day equals twenty years." The leading cadres of each unit must treat this movement with full enthusiasm. Constantly oppose conservatism and complacency, and continue to guide the movement to a correct, scientific, and mass-based track, which is the key to completing this year's leap forward plan. The most important issue at present is to comprehensively promote key advanced experiences and new technologies through large-scale summaries, large-scale inspections, large-scale evaluations, large-scale popularizations, and large-scale improvements, so that they can become the property of society as much as possible.

    The meeting believes that, based on the current excellent situation and the development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, it is entirely possible to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. It requires all factories and mines to earnestly change the "routine" of having a lower output value in the second quarter than in the first quarter, and strive to complete half of the annual plan in the first half of the year, and continue to increase the daily production level of major products such as steel, iron, steel, coal, cement, and machine tools compared to the first quarter. In this way, we can lay a better foundation for greatly overfulfilling the annual plan.

    In order to achieve the above goals, the meeting requested that each unit continuously put forward new requirements, new goals, and new slogans based on the development of the movement, and revise, supplement, and develop the original technological innovation and technological revolution plans. Now many factories have put forward the fighting slogan of "doubling output value and halving the number of personnel." According to statistics from 589 units, 241 units can double their output value this year, and this movement should be carried out universally. In the face of this new situation, it must be foreseen that with the great development of production, the need for raw materials, materials, and fuels will also greatly increase. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out a vigorous mass movement to increase production and conserve raw materials, materials, and fuels, and to vigorously engage in diversified operations and comprehensive utilization. All factories and mines must, in accordance with the principle of self-reliance, start by themselves, and seize coal, wood, and comprehensive utilization of slag. All steelmaking plants and ironmaking plants must regard reducing iron consumption and coal consumption as a major task; the chemical industry sector must strengthen recycling; the textile industry must make full use of waste cotton, hemp silk, and waste cloth for blending, and vigorously develop second products; at the same time, it is necessary to vigorously engage in the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products.

    The meeting also discussed carrying out a mass movement of running small-scale foreign groups and small-scale indigenous groups, as well as supporting the movement of agricultural technology transformation.

    During the meeting, many units immediately mobilized the masses to set off a new upsurge in production based on the spirit of the meeting. After the meeting, all units convened various meetings to mobilize the masses and formulate new production leap forward plans. Now, a new leap forward climax of surpassing the first quarter in the second quarter and doubling production is rising throughout the city.

    有革新就支持　有困难就援助　有问题就解决
    首都工业企业力争二季超一季
    据新华社讯　5月超4月，二季超一季，力争上半年完成全年计划的一半。这是中共北京市委5日到7日召开的工业交通五级干部会议提出的奋斗目标。这次会议总结和交流了全市以机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动的丰富经验，讨论了争取实现今年更大更好更全面跃进的问题。
    中共北京市委第一书记彭真到会作了重要讲话，中共北京市委第二书记刘仁在会上作了报告。
    首都工业交通战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动，在规模上和内容上，最近又都有了新的发展。在许多行业和企业中，生产面貌一天一个样，甚至一日数变。技术革命的大高潮，带来了生产的全面大跃进，今年以来生产逐月上升，月月全面超额完成国家计划。全市工业总产值2月比1月提高11％，3月比2月提高15％，4月比3月又提高8％。绝大部分产品质量保持稳定或继续提高，生产效率迅速上升，到目前为止，全市工业交通部门已经抽出两万六千多名职工，支援新建扩建单位。
    会议指出，技术革新和技术革命取得这样伟大的胜利，根本的原因，是在运动中贯彻执行了马克思列宁主义的群众路线，在党的集中领导下，把企业的全部工作，系统的技术改造，最新技术的运用，通统放手发动群众去办。结果是，几十万人投入了技术革新和技术革命的洪流，人人发议论，提建议，造机器，作试验，土洋结合，能洋则洋，可土则土，百花齐放，万紫千红。党委书记、厂长、工人、技术人员、管理人员、服务人员、大学教授、学生、机关干部、部队官兵以至街道居民，一起动手。运动中涌现出无数英雄人物。会议指出，广大职工群众这种高度的积极性和创造性，表明党的群众路线在过去大搞群众运动的基础上，已经有了新的重大的发展，越来越多的干部，已经懂得或者学会了在经济建设中运用群众路线了。这是党的群众路线在生产斗争中的伟大胜利。会议号召全体职工今后要坚定不移地贯彻执行这一条马克思列宁主义的路线。
    会议赞扬了在这次运动中出现的千千万万个“革新迷”，指出：广大职工群众在技术革新、技术革命运动中，所以这样分秒必争、不计报酬地进行创造性的劳动，这是因为他们在党的教育下，坚持政治挂帅，树立了无产阶级的雄心壮志，对于迅速改变祖国一穷二白的面貌，具有强烈的愿望，因此在运动中表现了无高不攀无坚不摧的英雄气概。会议要求各级领导干部要十分爱护群众的这种革命干劲，要做到有革新就支持，有困难就援助，有疏忽就提醒，有问题就解决。群众越是进行着奋不顾身的忘我的劳动，领导者就越要十分关心群众的生活，全面妥善地安排职工的工作和休息、学习和生活，注意精简会议；抓紧安全生产，做好防暑工作和夏季卫生，开展体育活动；养猪种菜，办好食堂；妥善安排理论和文化学习，做到劳逸结合，以保证生产的持续跃进。
    会议指出，理论和实践的紧密结合是这次运动的另一个显著特点。大跃进中出现的“三结合”的工作方法，又有了进一步的发展。现在不仅有厂内的“三结合”，即在党委领导下的领导干部、工人、技术人员的结合，还出现了工厂、高等学校、研究机关的“三结合”，以及设计部门、制造部门、使用部门的“三结合”。这些“三结合”，在推动生产大发展的同时，也使科学技术理论得到了新的发展。现在，在生产实践中久经锻炼的广大工人群众，正如饥如渴地努力提高文化技术水平，飞速地掌握科学技术理论知识，并且在生产实践中创造性地加以广泛运用。而数以万计的技术人员、高等学校师生、研究设计人员，则纷纷到工厂参加技术革命，他们认真地向工人学习，和工人并肩奋战，在劳动和群众运动的烈火中锻炼自己。这种理论和实践的紧密结合，对于推动技术革命运动和教学、科学研究工作的发展，有着极其重要的意义。当前的任务，就是要迅速总结和研究群众创造的极其丰富的新经验、新技术，加以系统化，把群众的新经验集中起来，发展和创造新的科学技术理论，使理论再回到实践中去，进一步指导生产实践，更有力地推动生产的持续跃进。
    会议着重指出，现在正在开展着的技术革新和技术革命运动，是一个急风暴雨的革命运动，形势发展很快，“一天等于二十年”，各单位的领导干部要满腔热情地对待这个运动。不断反对保守、自满情绪，把运动继续引导到正确的、科学的、全民的轨道上去，这是完成今年跃进计划的关键。当前最重要的问题，是要通过大总结、大检查、大评比、大普及、大提高，全面推广关键性的先进经验和新技术，使它尽可能地变成社会的财产。
    会议认为，根据目前的大好形势和技术革新、技术革命运动的发展情况，今年完全有可能实现更大更好更全面的跃进。要求各厂矿企业切实转变历年第二季度产值低于第一季度的“常规”，前半年争取完成全年计划的一半，钢、铁、钢材、煤炭、水泥、机床等主要产品的日产水平比第一季度继续提高。这样，就可以为大大超额完成全年计划奠定更好的基础。
    为了实现上述目标，会议要求各单位根据运动的发展状况，不断地提出新的要求，新的目标，新的口号，修正补充和发展原定的技术革新和技术革命规划。现在许多工厂提出了“产值产量翻番，全体人员减半”的战斗口号，根据五百八十九个单位统计，今年产值可以翻番的就有二百四十一个单位，这个运动应该普遍开展起来。在这种新的形势面前，必须预见到，随着生产的大发展，对于原料、材料、燃料的需要也将大大增加，因此必须开展一个轰轰烈烈的原料、材料、燃料的增产节约运动，大搞多种经营、综合利用。各厂矿企业都要根据自力更生的原则，大家动手，抓紧煤炭、木材和炉渣的综合利用；所有炼钢厂、炼铁厂，都要把降低铁耗、煤耗当作一项重大任务；化学工业部门要加强回收工作；纺织工业要多方利用废旧棉花、麻丝和废布等进行混纺，大力发展第二种产品；同时，要大搞农副产品的综合利用。
    会议对开展一个大办小洋群、小土群的群众运动，以及支援农业技术改造的运动，也都做了讨论。
    在会议进行期间，许多单位根据会议精神，立即动员群众掀起生产新高潮。会议结束后，各单位纷纷召开各种会议，动员群众，制定新的生产跃进规划。现在，一个二季超一季、生产大翻番的新的跃进高潮正在全市兴起。
