What is the Real Grave Situation in Japan
By Our Correspondent

The Japanese people's struggle to prevent the Diet from approving the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has entered a critical moment of decisive significance. There is only one week left until the closing date (May 26) of this Diet session. In addition to preparing to use force to compel the Japanese Diet to approve this aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the Kishi Nobusuke government has intensified its deceptive and intimidating tactics. On the 16th, he again told the Japanese people that if the new "Security Treaty" is not passed by this Diet session, "Japan, belonging to the free camp, will lose international credibility and create a grave situation."

What international credibility is Kishi Nobusuke talking about? Isn't the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty itself the best testimony to the destruction of international credibility? This aggressive treaty, which not only stipulates that Japan can expand its armaments without limit, but also stipulates that Japanese troops can jointly attack and fight alongside the U.S. military, does it conform in any way with the Potsdam Proclamation and the Far Eastern Commission's resolution on the basic policy for Japan after its surrender, which advocate "ensuring that Japan will no longer become a threat to world peace and security"? According to the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the United States can not only continue to station troops in Japan and maintain its military bases throughout Japan, but also intensify its political and economic control over Japan. So, is it only by continuing to endure the humiliation and suffering of the semi-occupation by the U.S. military, and only by tolerating the United States maintaining its "state within a state" in Japan, that the so-called "international credibility" of Kishi Nobusuke can be maintained?

As for "creating a grave situation," Kishi Nobusuke has also turned things upside down. Contrary to what Kishi Nobusuke said, if the Japanese Diet approves the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," it will truly create an extremely grave situation for Japan. In fact, hasn't the current situation in Japan already become quite serious due to the signing of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"? According to this military alliance treaty, Kishi Nobusuke has placed Japan in a position of hostility towards the people of China and the Soviet Union, towards the people of Asia, and towards all peace-loving people in the world, linking Japan's fate to the war plans of the most aggressive U.S. imperialism in the world today, turning Japan into a base for the United States to prepare for nuclear war in the Far East, and dragging Japan back onto the path of militarism, which once brought disaster to the Japanese people. Isn't this serious enough? The recent U-2 aircraft incident in the United States further proves the aggressive nature of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and the serious danger it poses to Japan. A large amount of material exposed by Japanese Socialist Party members and newspapers proves that the U-2 aircraft stationed by the United States in Japan are specifically engaged in espionage activities against China and the Soviet Union. People can clearly see that it is precisely because of the collusion between the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and the signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty that U.S. spy planes can unscrupulously use Japan as a base to invade China and the Soviet Union. Moreover, this treaty not only stipulates that Japan must provide military bases for the United States, but also stipulates that Japan needs to fight alongside the United States and act as an accomplice in U.S. aggression. In this way, the aggressive activities of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries not only threaten Asian peace, but also make it possible for Japan to be dragged into wars launched by the United States at any time. How can this be said to be not serious for the security of the Japanese people and the future of the Japanese nation?

It is precisely because the aggressive activities of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have become increasingly blatant, the situation created by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries has become increasingly serious, the Japanese people's awareness has increased day by day, and more and more people have become aware, that they have taken action to oppose the aggressive activities of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and to defend Japan's independence, peace, and security, launching a great struggle of magnificent proportions. No matter what cunning and deceptive methods Kishi Nobusuke uses, he has no way to deceive them. Kishi Nobusuke is already under siege by the Japanese people.

The Chinese people have always believed that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people, the common enemy of the Asian people, and the common enemy of the people of the world. The Chinese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world all support the Japanese people's struggle. We absolutely cannot allow U.S. imperialism to use Japanese bases in the Far East to plan new wars and provoke world peace. China and the socialist camp countries will never threaten or invade others, but we will never allow others to threaten or invade us. If the Japanese reactionaries, headed by the Kishi Nobusuke group, dare to collude with U.S. imperialism to carry out aggression in the Far East, we must resolutely strike and stop their evil actions. The Soviet government has submitted memorandums to the Kishi Nobusuke government more than once regarding the Japan-U.S. military treaty, pointing out that the Japanese government should bear all the consequences arising from the signing of the Japan-U.S. military treaty. Soviet Premier Khrushchev also emphasized in his recent speech on the U.S. aircraft's provocative actions against the Soviet Union that if U.S. spy planes violate Soviet airspace again, the Soviet Union will take retaliatory measures against the countries that provide bases for U.S. reconnaissance flights.

Now, because U.S. imperialism insists on its aggressive policy towards the Soviet Union and sabotages the Four-Power Summit, it is being denounced by the people of the world. U.S. imperialism is becoming increasingly isolated and increasingly frantic, which cannot but bring greater threats to world peace. Under such circumstances, Kishi Nobusuke dares to take all despicable means and conspire to force the Japanese Diet to pass the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The serious consequences are conceivable. Those who commit many injustices will inevitably destroy themselves. If Kishi Nobusuke insists on going his own way, then Batista and Syngman Rhee are lessons for Kishi Nobusuke. As Kishi Nobusuke intensifies his activities to forcibly approve the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, more and more Japanese people have been flocking to the Diet to petition in recent days. Tens of millions of Japanese people from all walks of life have resolutely stated through the "Declaration to Stop the Ratification of the Security Treaty and Demand the Dissolution of the Diet National Assembly" that "In order to defend our lives, there is no other way but to stop the ratification of the Security Treaty and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet!"

    什么是日本真正的严重局势 
    本报评论员
    日本人民阻止国会批准新的日美“安全条约”的斗争已经进入决定意义的紧要关头。现在离本届国会闭幕的日期（26日）只剩下一个星期了。岸信介政府除了在准备使用武力的手段，强使日本国会批准这个侵略性的日美军事同盟条约以外，还加紧了欺骗和恫吓的手段。16日他又对日本人民说，如果新“安全条约”不能在本届国会通过，“属于自由阵营的日本将失去国际信用，造成严重的形势”。
    岸信介说什么国际信用呢？难道日美军事同盟条约本身不就是破坏国际信用的最好的见证么？这个不但规定日本得以无限度扩充军备，而且规定日本军队可以同美军共同进攻、共同作战的侵略性条约，难道同主张“保证日本不再成为世界和平与安全之威胁”的波茨坦公告和远东委员会关于投降后日本之基本政策的决议等国际协议有丝毫相符之处吗？根据日美军事同盟条约，美国不但可以在日本继续驻军、继续保持它遍布整个日本的军事基地，而且在政治上、经济上也要加紧对日本的控制。那么，难道日本人民只有继续承受美军半占领状态下的屈辱和痛苦，只有容忍美国在日本保持它们的“国中之国”，才算不失去岸信介所谓的“国际信用”吗？
    至于说到“造成严重的形势”，岸信介也正好把事情颠倒过来了。同岸信介所说的恰恰相反，日本国会如果批准日美“安全条约”，才真正会给日本造成极其严重的形势。事实上，由于日美“安全条约”的签订，日本目前形势不是已经够严重的了吗？根据这个军事同盟条约，岸信介已经把日本置于同中苏人民、同亚洲人民、同全世界爱好和平人民为敌的地位，把日本的命运同当前世界上最富侵略性的美帝国主义的战争计划联在一起，把日本变为美国在远东准备核战争的基地，把日本重新拖上曾经给日本人民带来奇灾大祸的军国主义道路，难道这还不严重吗？最近美国U—2飞机事件的发生，更进一步证明日美军事同盟条约的侵略性和对于日本的严重危险。日本社会党议员和报刊所揭发的大量材料证明，美国驻在日本的U—2型飞机，专门对中国和苏联进行间谍活动。人们清楚地看到，正是由于美日反动派相互勾结、签订了日美军事同盟条约，美国间谍飞机才得以肆无忌惮地把日本作为侵犯中国和苏联的基地。何况这个条约不只规定日本要为美国提供军事基地，还规定日本需要和美国共同作战，充当美国的侵略帮凶。这样，美日反动派的侵略活动就不仅威胁亚洲和平，而且使日本随时有被美国卷入它所发动的战争中去的可能。这对于日本人民的安全和日本民族的前途，怎么能够说不严重呢？
    正是因为美日反动派的侵略活动已经日益露骨，日美反动派所造成的局势日益严重，日本人民的觉悟一天天提高了，觉悟的人越来越多了，他们已经行动起来，为反对美日反动派的侵略活动，为维护日本的独立、和平和安全，展开了气壮山河的伟大斗争。岸信介不论用什么狡猾诡诈的手法，都没有办法欺骗他们。岸信介已处于日本人民的围攻之中。
    中国人民一向认为，美帝国主义是中日两国人民的同共敌人，是亚洲人民的同共敌人，是全世界人民的同共敌人。中国人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民都支持日本人民的斗争，我们绝对不能允许美帝国主义在远东利用日本基地策划新战争，向世界和平挑衅。中国和社会主义阵营各国决不会威胁别人，侵略别人，但也决不允许别人威胁自己，侵略自己。以岸信介集团为首的日本反动派胆敢勾结美帝国主义在远东进行侵略，我们就一定要坚决给予打击，制止它们的罪恶行动。苏联政府曾不止一次地就日美军事条约向岸信介政府提交备忘录，指出，由于签订日美军事条约而产生的一切后果，应全部由日本政府承担。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫最近就美国飞机对苏联的挑衅行动发表谈话时，也已着重指出，如果再有美国间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空，苏联将对为美国的侦察飞行提供基地的国家采取报复性措施。
    现在，由于美帝国主义坚持对苏联的侵略政策，破坏四国首脑会议，它正遭到全世界人民的同声怒斥。美帝国主义越来越孤立，也越来越疯狂，这就不能不给世界和平带来更大的威胁。在这种形势之下，岸信介居然胆敢采取一切卑鄙手段，阴谋强使日本国会通过日美军事同盟条约，其严重后果，是可以想见的。多行不义必自毙，岸信介如果一意孤行下去，那么，巴蒂斯塔和李承晚都是岸信介的前车之鉴。随着岸信介加紧强行批准日美军事同盟条约的活动，最近以来，越来越多的日本人民不断涌向国会请愿。数以千万计的日本各阶层人民通过“阻止批准安全条约、要求解散国会国民大会”的宣言，坚决表示，“为了保卫我们的生命。除了阻止批准安全条约，打倒岸信介内阁以外，没有别的出路！”
