Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, in response to questions from Diet members, publicly defended the United States' crimes of using Japanese bases to collect intelligence on China and the Soviet Union, and willingly acted as an accomplice to U.S. aggression.

    Diet member Gentaro Takeya, speaking at a special committee meeting on the "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives on the 11th, said that Japan's territory was wide open to the United States. Allowing the U.S. military to use bases is tantamount to abandoning Japan's sovereignty. He demanded restrictions on U.S. military activities in Japan.

    Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, disregarding the interests of the Japanese nation, said, "It is a matter of course to provide the U.S. military with appropriate convenience and complete assistance."

    Takeya opposed Fujiyama's statement. He said, "If there are no restrictions, then the entire territory of Japan, especially its airspace, is no different from Okinawa." He said, "The U.S. military should not be allowed to conduct meteorological work."

    Japanese newspapers and Diet members have revealed that U.S. U-2 aircraft stationed in Japan, like those that intruded into Soviet airspace to collect intelligence, are conducting espionage activities against China and the Soviet Union under the guise of "meteorological observation."

    However, Fujiyama openly supported U.S. espionage activities, saying, "Meteorological observation is a matter of course as part of the U.S. military's duties." He also said, "These aircraft are only used for meteorological observation and will not cause harm to other countries."

    Fujiyama also falsely accused Khrushchev's legitimate warnings to countries providing bases for U.S. spy planes as "intimidating behavior." He also said: If the U.S. U-2 aircraft stationed in Japan "only violated (another country's) airspace, it cannot attack Japanese bases." He insisted that if the Soviet Union retaliated against the bases from which such aircraft took off, it could not be considered an exercise of the right of self-defense. Because retaliating against a base for a U-2 aircraft's violation of airspace is "a violation of the United Nations Charter." "If an armed attack is launched, Article 5 (of the new Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty') will be invoked."

    Article 5 of this Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty stipulates that Japan and the United States will take joint military action. Fujiyama also frantically said, "No matter what the reason, if Japan is attacked, Japan must rise up, that is a matter of course."

    Fujiyama's statement not only exposed the Kishi Nobusuke government's face as an accomplice to U.S. aggression but also reaffirmed the aggressive nature and danger to Japan of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

### 再次暴露岸政府是美国侵略帮凶  日外相公然支持美国间谍活动

    再次暴露岸政府是美国侵略帮凶
    日外相公然支持美国间谍活动
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本外务相藤山爱一郎在国会答复议员的质询时公开替美国利用日本基地搜集中苏情报的罪行辩解，并甘愿充当美国的侵略帮凶。
    议员竹谷源太郎11日在众议院“安全条约”特别委员会会议上谈到美国U—2型间谍飞机问题时说，日本的国土是向美国大敞大开着的。允许美军使用基地就是放弃日本的主权。他要求限制美军在日本的活动。
    日本外务相藤山爱一郎不顾日本民族利益说，“给美军以适当的方便，万全的援助，是当然的事情”。
    竹谷反对藤山的这种说法。他说：“如果不加以任何限制，那么日本全土尤其是领空就和冲绳没有不同了”。他说：“不应当让美军去进行气象工作”。
    日本报纸和议员已经揭露，驻在日本的美国U—2型飞机也和侵入苏联领空搜集情报一样，假借“观测气象”的名义对中苏进行间谍活动。
    但是，藤山却公然支持美国进行间谍活动，说什么“观察气象作为美军的分内工作，是理所当然的”。他还说：“这种飞机只用来观察气象，不会对别国造成危害”。
    藤山还反诬赫鲁晓夫对向美国间谍飞机提供基地的国家的正当警告是“威吓行为”。他并且说：驻在日本的美国U—2型飞机如果“只是侵犯了（别国）的领空，不能进攻日本基地”。他硬说，苏联如果对这种飞机起飞的基地进行还击，不能认为是行使自卫权。因为U—2型飞机侵犯领空就对基地进行还击，是“违反联合国宪章的”。“如果实行武装进攻，就会援用（新日美“安全条约”）第五条”。
    这个日美军事同盟条约的第五条规定日美两国采取联合的军事行动。藤山还疯狂地说：“不管什么理由，如果日本遭到进攻，日本就要奋起，那是理所当然的”。
    藤山的这次发言不仅暴露了岸信介政府为美国侵略行为作帮凶的嘴脸，而且再次表明了新日美“安全条约”的侵略本质和对日本的危险性。
