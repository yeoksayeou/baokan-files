    Rice Transplanter: Ingenious Craftsmanship
    A rice transplanter is like a flower, the girls in the fields adore it;
    Skilled hands weave a green carpet, and after the autumn harvest, the granaries burst.
    By Our Correspondents Liu Duqing and Pan Yuguo

    During this year's rice transplanting season, the commune members of Tangtou Commune on the west bank of the Wu River in the Guizhou Plateau, like their fellow farmers throughout the province, are launching an agricultural technology revolution centered on the use of rice transplanters. During the busy transplanting season, hundreds and thousands of rice transplanters have gone down to the fields. Whether in high mountains or plains, large dams or small hills, stories of the rice transplanter showing its prowess are spreading everywhere. People are unanimously praising the rice transplanter as a "treasure in the fields," saying that with the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we "mud-legged folks" are getting smarter and smarter.

    In fact, some of the people saying these words were shaking their heads on the ridges half a month ago, repeatedly claiming that using rice transplanters was just "哄娃儿" [哄娃儿 is a local dialect expression for fooling around or哄孩子, meaning "to coax a child"], "a waste of effort." I remember on the day of "opening the rice planting season," Peng Dezhen, Chen Qifen, and several other young women carried two "Tongren Improved Liling No. 3" rice transplanters to the fields early in the morning. While their hands were busy washing and loading seedlings, their mouths cheerfully sang mountain songs:

    A rice transplanter is like a flower, the girls in the fields adore it;
    Skilled hands weave a green carpet, and after the autumn harvest, the granaries burst.

    Unexpectedly, Tax Tingfu, a well-known veteran rice transplanter from Tangtou, walked over. Tax Tingfu was very confident in his rice transplanting skills and didn't even want to look at the rice transplanter last year. He approached and jokingly said, "Girls, transplanting by hand is much easier, why do you insist on pushing wooden boxes into the fields? It's like riding a horse while carrying a baggage on your back - completely unnecessary.”

    "The machine transplants twelve seedlings with one push, why don't you try it, old man!"

    "That sounds good, but in the end, we still have to clean up the mess by hand." As Tax Tingfu spoke, he rolled up his trousers and went down to the field, picked up a handful of seedlings, and declared that he would compete with the rice transplanter. He stood firm, kept his eyes straight, and quickly began transplanting with both hands. In less than a minute, he transplanted thirty seedlings.

    The girls, seeing that he was serious, immediately pushed the machine. Quickly, in less than ten rounds, they had left Tax Tingfu far behind, with the seedlings planted evenly, firmly, and neatly. After about half an hour, Tax Tingfu stopped, patted his waist, and said breathlessly, "Let me try pushing the rice transplanter." Peng Dezhen held his hand and pointed out the instructions. Tax Tingfu spoke and laughed, "We can rest assured about transplanting this year, it will be at least a month faster."

    It turned out that Tangtou Commune in Sinan County has a Banana Dam, which suffers from drought almost every year in June of the lunar calendar. In the past, there were few people and transplanting was slow, often dragging on until late May of the lunar calendar. This year, by using rice transplanters, just catching up with the season alone will increase production by tens of thousands of catties of grain.

    In a few days, the story of Tax Tingfu admitting defeat in the competition spread further and further, and more and more people were talking about rice transplanters. In order to further root the rice transplanter in the minds of the commune members, the commune party committee immediately organized commune members to visit the fields for demonstration and training, and spoke at length about the benefits of rice transplanters. Some people said, "In the past, we transplanted fields by hand for ten days, but now we can finish it in one day with the machine." Others said, "What's the use of just being fast? If production decreases in the future, it won't be worth it!"

    "Production will definitely increase, we have the facts to prove it." The young men of the Banana Team directly retorted. As early as last year, Liu Shifen, the captain of the Banana Youth Production Team, a provincial rice transplanter model worker, and a national "March 8th" Red Banner holder, conducted a comparative experiment between rice transplanting by machine and by hand: in ten mu of paddy fields with the same soil quality, water source, and fertilizer, machine transplanting and hand transplanting each accounted for five mu. The machine-transplanted area averaged 900 catties per mu, 300 catties more than the hand-transplanted area. Some commune members said, "That was just luck." Why can it increase production? This was still a mystery to the vast majority of commune members. The commune's science and technology research institute invited experienced veteran commune members to conduct a serious analysis on the spot and found two main reasons: first, the seedlings transplanted by the machine are shallow and stable, and can generally return to green and tiller about three days earlier than hand-transplanted seedlings, resulting in a consistent maturity period; second, the machine-transplanted seedlings had a reasonable close planting density last year, reaching more than 25,000 seedlings per mu, while hand-transplanted seedlings were sparsely and unevenly planted, generally about 15,000 seedlings. As the saying goes, "Clear water shows the bottom, transparent words reach the heart," some people who doubted whether rice transplanters could increase production were also convinced.

    People who have used their hands to transplant rice for generations and have suffered the pain of bending over and straining their backs, once they understand the benefits of rice transplanters, a surge of mass production and promotion of rice transplanters quickly rolled over Tangtou. A new trend of "everyone striving to be a skillful carpenter, everyone learning to use rice transplanters" emerged everywhere. When the woodworking factory was rushing to manufacture rice transplanters, the commune party committee secretary took the lead in becoming a carpenter, and some people stayed up all night. Now, from the commune party committee to the small team branch secretary, everyone has a rice transplanter. Some families have become "small factories," with couples making rice transplanters together. Young women and men have become the main force in promoting the use of rice transplanters, some practicing martial arts under the moonlight, and some still reciting the rice transplanter operation formula "one open, two clip, three insert, four wash, five push" in their dreams. Li Chengbiao, a young canteen cook, spread the firewood ash burned in the stove on the ground and used pine needles as seedlings, loaded them on the rice transplanter to practice his skills. He won the title of model worker in the commune's rice transplanter competition.

    On the day before we left Tangtou Commune, in the newly harvested wheat and rapeseed fields, in just one night, the rice transplanters had covered the land with patches of tender green seedlings. It was truly as smooth as a mirror and as straight as a line, giving people a sense of "ingenious craftsmanship." In the face of such facts, who can deny the tremendous power of rice transplanters?

### 插秧机巧夺天工  插秧机来一枝花，塘头姑娘爱上它；巧手织成绿地毯，秋后粮食挤破仓。

    插秧机巧夺天工
    插秧机来一枝花，塘头姑娘爱上它；巧手织成绿地毯，秋后粮食挤破仓。
    本报记者　柳独青　潘玉国
    在今年的插秧季节里，贵州高原乌江西岸塘头公社的社员们，正像全省各地的农民弟兄一样，掀起了一场以使用插秧机为主的农业技术大革命。在大忙的插秧季节里，成百上千的插秧机下田了。不管是高山平地，还是大坝小丘，到处都传遍了插秧机逞能的故事。人们异口同声地称赞插秧机是“田中宝”，说有了共产党和毛主席的领导，我们这些“泥巴脚杆”越来越聪明了。
    其实，说这些话的人，有的在半个月前还在田坎上摇头，口口声声嚷着用插秧机只能“哄娃儿”，“费力不讨好”。记得“开秧门”那天，彭德珍和陈启芬等几个年轻姑娘，赶大清早就搬着两部“铜仁改良醴陵三号”插秧机来到了田边，她们手上忙着洗秧、装秧，口里愉快地唱起山歌：
    插秧机来一枝花，塘头姑娘爱上它；
    巧手织成绿地毯，秋后粮食挤破仓。
    不想，远远地走来了塘头有名的老秧师税厅富。税厅富对自己插秧技术信心十足，去年连插秧机瞧都不愿瞧，他走近来打趣地说：“么妹，甩手栽秧多轻快，你们偏要推木盒子下田，真是骑马背包袱，多此一举。”
    “机子插秧，一推就是十二窝，你老人家试试再说嘛！”
    “说的真好听，搞下来还不是靠我们用手来解围。”税厅富一边说一边挽起裤脚下了田，顺手拿起一把秧，声称要和插秧机比比。只见他脚踏骑马桩，两眼直视，双手不停地插开了。不到一分钟，就栽了三十来窝。
    姑娘们一看事情当真啦，马上推动机子。说时迟，那时快，不上十来个回合，就把税厅富远远地丢在后边，秧苗插的又匀又稳又整齐。大约半个钟头，税厅富自动站住了，用手捶着腰，气喘吁吁地说：“让我也来推推插秧机。”这时彭德珍把着他的手，指指点点，税厅富连讲带笑道：“今年插秧可放心了，至少也要快上个把月。”
    原来，思南县塘头公社有个芭蕉大坝，几乎年年农历6月要遭旱灾。过去人手少，插秧又慢，往往要拖到农历5月下旬才栽得完。今年使用插秧机，光说赶上季节这一项，就要增产上万斤粮食。
    不几天，税厅富比武服输的事越传越远，人们谈论插秧机的也越来越多。公社党委为了要使插秧机进一步地在社员心中扎下根，便随即组织社员临田参观练武，大谈特谈插秧机的好处。有人说：“过去咱们用手插十天的田，如今用机子一天就插完了。”有的却说：“光快有什么用，将来减产才犯不着哩！”
    “一定增产，我们有事实作证。”芭蕉队的小伙子们直截了当地驳了过去。早在去年，芭蕉青年生产队队长、省插秧机标兵、全国“三八”红旗手刘仕芬，就用插秧机和手插秧作了对比试验：在同样土质、水源、肥料相等的十亩稻田里，机插、手插各占五亩，机插平均每亩收了九百斤，比手插多三百斤。有的社员又说：“那还不是碰上的。”到底为什么能增产呢？这对绝大多数社员来说还是一个谜。公社科学技术研究所邀集了有经验的老社员当场认真作了分析，找出两个主要原因：首先机子插的秧浅又稳，一般可比手插提早三天左右返青发蔸，成熟期一致；其次是去年机插密植规格合理，每亩达二万五千窝以上，手插秧稀密不匀，一般约一万五千窝左右。常言说得好，“水清鱼见底，话透心里明”，一些怀疑插秧机能否增产的人也心服了。
    世世代代用手插秧，饱经弯腰曲背之苦的人，一旦弄清了插秧机的好处，一股大制造、大推广插秧机的激流，很快就在塘头翻滚了。到处出现了“人人争当巧木匠，个个学会插秧机”的新风气。木工厂在突击制造插秧机时，公社党委书记带头当木匠，有的人彻夜不眠。现在从公社党委到小队支部书记，每人都有一部插秧机。有的家庭成了“小工厂”，夫妻双造插秧机。青年姑娘和小伙子们变成了推广使用插秧机的主力军，有的月下练武，有的梦里还在背诵着“一开二夹三插四洗五推”的插秧机操作口诀。年青的食堂炊事员李成镖，把灶里烧过的柴草灰铺在地上，用松毛当秧苗，装在插秧机上练本领，在公社比赛插秧机时，他获得了标兵称号。
    当我们离开塘头公社的前一天，在刚抢收的小麦、油菜田里，只一夜功夫，就被插秧机连片地铺上了嫩绿的禾苗。真是水平如镜，行直如线，令人有“巧夺天工”之感。在这样的事实面前，谁还能否认插秧机的巨大威力呢？
