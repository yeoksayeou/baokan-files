Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, 17th - Overseas Chinese from Samarinda, Indonesia, who returned to Zhanjiang, Guangdong Province, on the "Hai Huang" ship on May 6, have condemned with utmost anger the violent actions of the Samarinda military authorities and the Prosecutor's Office in Indonesia, under the instruction and support of powerful groups in Indonesia, in illegally detaining Jiang Yan, the Chinese Consul in Maqin, infringing upon consular powers, and using force to threaten Overseas Chinese who wish to return to China.

Jiang Yan, the Chinese Consul in Maqin, arrived in Samarinda on April 26 to handle the affairs of local persecuted Overseas Chinese returning to China. He was illegally detained on the evening of April 27, and Overseas Chinese who wished to return to China were also threatened with force.

Returned Overseas Chinese Zhang Long and others said that on the evening of April 27, Samarinda was suddenly filled with a tense atmosphere. Two armed soldiers stood outside Consul Jiang Yan's residence, and military police guarded the door of Cai Jinfas, the head of the local Overseas Chinese organization. From Kalimantan Street where Consul Jiang Yan's residence was located, turning past the Stele Street, Flower Street, to the Chinese School, where Overseas Chinese办理回国手续， every intersection in this area was filled with armed sentries. The wharf where the returning Overseas Chinese's luggage was loaded had an increased squad of troops, and there were also patrol teams and military jeeps patrolling everywhere.

Zhang Long and others said that according to Wang Wenbin, a staff member of the Reception and Resettlement Committee for Overseas Chinese working on the "Hai Huang" ship, who was also detained at the same time, after the Samarinda military headquarters and the Prosecutor's Office detained Consul Jiang Yan and others, they also sent soldiers to issue an "order" to Consul Jiang Yan: the consul was not allowed to leave his residence, was not allowed to receive any visitors, and had to leave Samarinda before dark on April 28. The relevant military authorities and the Prosecutor's Office in Samarinda also did not allow Overseas Chinese to contact the consul by telephone, and even when Zhang Long and other Overseas Chinese called the person in charge of the Chinese General Association, the operator said that there was an order from above that Overseas Chinese were not allowed to make phone calls. Zhang Long and others said that, obviously, the local military headquarters and the Prosecutor's Office rudely cut off all channels of external contact for Consul Jiang Yan, seriously infringing upon consular powers and personal freedom.

Returned Overseas Chinese Lu Yaoda said: "At nine o'clock in the morning on the 28th, when I went to see the consul, more sentries were added at the consul's door, and I was not allowed to approach. I explained to them that I was there to see the consul to handle matters related to returning to China, but they still did not allow me to enter. I asked why the Overseas Chinese of one country were not allowed to see the consul of their own country, and they said fiercely: 'You just can't!' and ordered me to leave immediately. Later, a sentry escorted me to the gendarmerie."

Returned Overseas Chinese pointed out that Consul Jiang Yan had always shown sincerity in friendly cooperation with the authorities in handling the affairs of Overseas Chinese in Samarinda returning to China. However, the Samarinda military headquarters, the Prosecutor's Office and other departments not only failed to fulfill their responsibility to assist the consuls of friendly countries in exercising their duties, but instead obstructed them in various ways in order to achieve the purpose of obstructing Overseas Chinese from returning to China. Returned Overseas Chinese Zhang Kaichun said that before the "Hai Huang" arrived, the Overseas Chinese preparing to return to China had generally completed the procedures for returning to China. After Consul Jiang Yan arrived, he held meetings and consultations with Saidi, the wartime power holder, as well as officials from the police bureau, immigration bureau, and the Prosecutor's Office, to handle the remaining procedures for Overseas Chinese returning to China. They unanimously agreed to complete the final procedures for Overseas Chinese returning to China before 4:00 pm that day, but the Prosecutor's Office deliberately delayed the matter. At 5:00 pm, only a little over a hundred people had finished affixing their fingerprints, and the staff responsible for handling the procedures for Overseas Chinese returning to China closed the doors and stopped working. There were still more than five hundred Overseas Chinese who had not completed the procedures, including the elderly and children who needed care, who stayed there and asked to continue with the procedures. Consul Jiang Yan also came to the place where Overseas Chinese were handling the procedures at around 5:00 pm and sincerely said to Prosecutor Hamza: "Let's negotiate, let's negotiate." and asked the prosecutor why he did not continue to handle the procedures. However, the prosecutor was very rude and said: "We'll do it tomorrow," and then took the opportunity to slip away.

Returned Overseas Chinese said that the violent act of the relevant military authorities and the Prosecutor's Office in Samarinda in illegally detaining our consul was arranged long ago under the instruction of powerful groups in Indonesia. Before Consul Jiang Yan arrived in Samarinda, the local gendarmerie received an order from above, requiring the gendarmerie to "monitor the consul's activities" and "take strong measures." Some gendarmes even openly circulated this order among the Overseas Chinese. The purpose of the powerful groups in Indonesia in doing so was obviously to deliberately create a tense situation, obstruct Overseas Chinese from returning to China, and undermine the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples.

Returned Overseas Chinese also accused the Samarinda military and the Prosecutor's Office of using barbaric force and infringing on the personal freedom of Overseas Chinese in order to obstruct Overseas Chinese from returning to China while illegally detaining our consul. Returned Overseas Chinese Lu Yaoda and others said that on the evening of the 27th, the local military sent six armed military police with one light machine gun and one submachine gun each to force us, the Overseas Chinese waiting at the Chinese School to handle the procedures for returning to China, to go home, and then took turns using armed personnel to guard us all night. The next day, they also set up machine guns opposite the Chinese School. The Overseas Chinese said indignantly: It is the right of every Overseas Chinese to ask to return to their motherland. Since the anti-Chinese elements in Indonesia do not allow us to reside locally, they should assist us in returning to our country. At that time, we were only asking to realize our wish to return to our country and asking the relevant authorities in Samarinda to fulfill their promises and continue to fulfill their due responsibilities. Why did they use force against us? This is extremely unreasonable and unfriendly behavior.

Returned Overseas Chinese pointed out that this incident seriously violated international law and infringed upon basic human rights. Its occurrence was by no means accidental. The atrocities of the Samarinda military and the Prosecutor's Office and other departments are a farce in the anti-Chinese drama directed by powerful groups in Indonesia. They demand that the Indonesian government seriously handle this incident, punish the relevant personnel, and prevent similar incidents from happening again.

### 归国侨胞严斥三马林达当局的无理行动  印度尼西亚有势力集团蓄意阻挠华侨回国  非法软禁中国领事的暴行绝不是偶然事件

    归国侨胞严斥三马林达当局的无理行动
    印度尼西亚有势力集团蓄意阻挠华侨回国
    非法软禁中国领事的暴行绝不是偶然事件
    新华社湛江17日电　5月6日乘“海皇号”轮船回到广东省湛江的印度尼西亚三马林达华侨，无比愤怒地谴责印度尼西亚三马林达军事当局和检察署在印度尼西亚有势力集团的授意、支持下，软禁中国政府驻马辰领事江燕，侵犯领事职权、用武力威胁要求回国的华侨的暴行。
    中国驻马辰领事江燕是在4月26日到达三马林达料理当地受迫害华侨归国事宜的。他在4月27日傍晚遭到了软禁，同时要求归国的华侨也受到了武力威胁。
    归侨张龙等人说，4月27日傍晚，三马林达突然充满紧张气氛。江燕领事的住所突然站着两个武装军人，当地华侨团体负责人蔡金发的门口，也有军警看守。从江燕领事住所所在的加里曼丹街拐过石碑街、花街直到华侨办理手续的地方——中华学校，这一带的每一个十字路口都布有武装岗哨。装运归侨随身行李的码头增加了一个班的军队，此外还有巡逻队、军用吉普车到处巡逻。
    张龙等人说，据被同时软禁的、在“海皇号”上工作的接待和安置归国华侨委员会工作人员王文斌事后告诉我们，三马林达军部和检察署将江燕领事等软禁起来以后，还派军人前来向江燕领事下达“命令”：不准领事离开住所，不准接见任何来人，并且要在4月28日天黑以前离开三马林达。三马林达有关军事当局和检察署还不让华侨用电话和领事取得联系，甚至当张龙等几位侨胞打电话找中华总会负责人时，接线员也说，上级有命令，不准外侨通电话。张龙等人说，显然，当地军部和检察署粗暴地中断江燕领事的一切对外联系的途径，严重地侵犯了领事职权和人身自由。
    归侨卢耀达说：“28日上午九时，我去找领事时，领事门口又增加了哨兵，不许我近前。我向他们说明，我是为了办理有关回国手续的事情来见领事的，他们仍然不许我入内。我问为什么不准一个国家的侨民求见本国的领事，他们恶狠狠地说：‘不可以就不可以！’并且命令我马上离开，后来竟由一名哨兵把我押送到宪兵部。”
    归侨们指出，江燕领事在料理三马林达华侨回国事务工作中，一直表现了与当局友好合作的诚意。但是，三马林达军部、检察署等部门，不仅没有尽到协助友好国家领事行使职务的责任，反而多方阻挠，以便达到阻挠华侨回国的目的。归侨张开春说，在“海皇号”到达前，准备回国的华侨大体上已经办完返回中国的手续。江燕领事到达后，就和当地战时掌权者萨伊迪，以及警察局、移民局、检察署的官员等开会协商办理还没有办完的有关华侨回国的手续，彼此一致协议在当天下午四时以前办完华侨回国的最后手续，但是检察署人员有意拖延，下午五时只有一百多人按完了手印，负责办理华侨回国手续的工作人员就关上大门不办公了。还有五百多名未办完手续的华侨，其中有需要照顾的老人和小孩，留在那里要求继续办理手续，江燕领事也在下午五点左右来到侨胞们办理手续的地方，诚恳地对检察官哈姆扎说：“我们协商一下，我们协商一下。”并问检察官为什么不继续办理手续。检察官却态度蛮横地说：“明天再办”，后来又借机溜走了。
    归国华侨们说，三马林达有关军事当局和检察署软禁我国领事的暴行，是在印度尼西亚有势力集团的授意下早有安排的。在江燕领事到达三马林达前，当地的宪兵部就接到上级的命令，要宪兵部“监视领事活动”、“应采取强硬措施”。一些宪兵还公然将这个命令在华侨中传阅。印度尼西亚有势力集团这样做的目的，显然是为了有意制造紧张局势，阻挠华侨回国，并破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的友好关系。
    归侨们还指责三马林达军方和检察署在软禁我国领事的同时，为了阻挠华侨回国，还野蛮地使用武力，侵犯华侨的人身自由。归侨卢耀达等人说，27日傍晚，当地军部派来六名武装军警带着轻机关枪、手提机关枪各一挺，逼迫我们集中在中华学校等候办理回国手续的华侨回家，后来又轮流用武装人员，看守了我们一个通宵。第二天，他们还把机关枪架在中华学校的对面。归侨们愤慨地说：要求回到祖国，这是每一个侨民应有的权利。印度尼西亚排华分子既然不容我们在当地居留，就应该协助我们回国。我们当时只是要求实现自己的回国愿望，要求三马林达有关当局的人员实现诺言，继续完成他们应尽的职责。他们凭什么用武力对付我们？这是蛮不讲理的极不友好的行为。
    归侨们纷纷指出，这一事件严重地违反了国际公法，侵害了基本人权。它的发生绝不是偶然的。三马林达军方和检察署等部门的暴行，是印度尼西亚有势力集团导演的排华丑剧中的一折。他们要求印度尼西亚政府严正处理这一事件，惩办有关人员，防止再发生类似事件。
