Xinhua News Agency, 23rd -- Beijing's industrial and mining enterprises and urban and rural people's communes are conscientiously implementing the "Instructions of the CPC Central Committee on Promoting Phonetic Literacy" and are making various preparations for a large-scale mass phonetic literacy campaign.

    Beginning in February this year, Beijing first widely publicized and studied the experience of Wanrong County in phonetic literacy to lay a solid ideological foundation for carrying out the mass phonetic literacy movement. The Municipal Education Bureau also invited responsible cadres from the Wanrong County Party Committee's Cultural and Educational Department to give reports to spare-time education cadres and teachers, introducing the experience of Wanrong County in carrying out the phonetic literacy movement. Subsequently, relevant departments in the city also formed visiting groups to visit Wanrong County to learn. After they returned, they made introductions at various cadre meetings convened in the city. Some factories, mines, enterprises, and urban and rural people's communes' spare-time schools also used blackboard bulletins, broadcasts, and other forms to widely publicize the "Instructions of the CPC Central Committee on Promoting Phonetic Literacy" and the experience of Wanrong County in phonetic literacy, and organized students to study and discuss them. Xicheng, Xuanwu, Dongcheng, Chaoyang, and other districts have all conducted phonetic literacy experiments. Experiments have proved that the implementation of phonetic literacy speeds up the progress of literacy, enhances the confidence of illiterate people in learning Chinese characters, and consolidates and expands the results of literacy, which is warmly welcomed by the masses. Since the Fusuijing People's Commune in Xicheng District learned from Wanrong County's experience and launched the phonetic literacy campaign at the end of February, it has basically eliminated illiteracy and semi-literacy among young and middle-aged people. Currently, it is launching a mass reading and writing campaign. The masses reflected that learning Hanyu Pinyin gave them a "backbone" and a "permanent teacher."

    In order to carry out the mass phonetic literacy campaign, Beijing has trained a large number of phonetic literacy teachers at all levels from the city and districts to the grassroots units. Xicheng, Xuanwu, Chaoyang, Dongcheng, and other districts have trained nearly three thousand teachers. The Municipal Education Bureau also held phonetic literacy teacher training classes to train a group of core teachers for each district and some factories, mines, and enterprises. In many pilot units, the students who participated in the study learned the phonetic alphabet and Pinyin, and immediately became "little teachers" to teach others, which rapidly developed the phonetic literacy movement.

    The Municipal and District Education Bureaus are also actively preparing teaching materials and popular reading materials for carrying out the phonetic literacy movement. Xicheng, Chaoyang, and other districts have already compiled some teaching materials. The Municipal Education Bureau has also organized a group of teachers, with the assistance of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, to adapt sets of workers' and peasants' phonetic literacy textbooks. According to Wanrong County's experience, this textbook stipulates that students should master the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet and four hundred syllables skillfully during the learning process; in the teaching process, attention should be paid to carrying out mass reading and writing activities. Some municipal publishing, printing, and book distribution departments have also recently studied how to print a batch of phonetic literacy textbooks and reading materials as soon as possible, including phonetic literacy primers for workers and farmers, phonetic literacy language textbooks for senior primary schools, and a large number of phonetic popular reading materials and phonetic dictionaries.

    At present, the phonetic literacy movement in Xicheng, Xuanwu, and other districts has moved from training teachers and conducting key experiments to a new stage of comprehensive promotion in literacy classes and spare-time schools throughout the districts.

Xinhua News Agency, 23rd -- The Fusuijing People's Commune in Xicheng District, Beijing, has learned from the phonetic literacy experience of Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, grasping it tightly and acting quickly. In just over two months, from the beginning of February this year to now, 650 of the 714 illiterate and semi-literate people in the entire commune have graduated from literacy classes. Currently, they are launching a mass movement of extensive reading and massive creation, setting off a new upsurge in the march towards culture.

    In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, Fusuijing's street literacy work has made great achievements. Illiteracy among young and middle-aged people has been basically eliminated, but the problem of relapse has not been solved for a long time. According to the 1959 inspection, the relapse rate reached about 30%. After the establishment of the People's Commune, street women actively participated in production, and their demand for culture became even more urgent. On February 12th this year, the People's Daily introduced the experience of phonetic literacy in Wanrong County, Shanxi Province. The Fusuijing Commune Party Committee quickly promoted this experience, which achieved great results in a short period of time. For example, Jin Xia, a worker at the Civil Lighting Fixture Processing Factory, originally knew very few characters. After learning Hanyu Pinyin, she spent only two months of spare time learning 1,500 characters, achieving a dictation score of over 80, and was able to write short essays of 200 to 300 Chinese characters. Zhang Yuzhen, a mother of five children, had participated in literacy learning five times but dropped out halfway each time. This time, she only spent 22 hours learning Hanyu Pinyin, and then read the Pinyin literacy textbook and six Pinyin reading materials, quickly advancing to the senior primary school class. Currently, more than 4,000 people in the entire commune have participated in the Hanyu Pinyin learning movement, including illiterate, semi-literate, and senior primary, junior high, and senior high school students. They all praised Hanyu Pinyin as the "backbone" of literacy and their own "tutoring teacher," and enthusiastically wrote poems praising it: "Learning Pinyin is not difficult, work hard and study diligently, everyone should read it, reading and recognizing characters is really convenient."

    The emphasis and active strengthening of leadership by the Commune Party Committee is the main reason for the achievements. The First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee went deep into the factory amidst his busy schedule to understand the students' learning situation, and used various examples to conduct in-depth mobilization work among cadres and teachers. The Party branches of various units took measures to ensure students' learning time, such as "ensuring enrollment, ensuring attendance, and ensuring time" for students participating in Hanyu Pinyin learning. The teachers also carried forward the spirit of "service stations," using the students' production gaps to provide tutoring anytime and anywhere. All of this made the students deeply feel the warmth of the socialist big family, and their enthusiasm for learning was even higher.

    The Commune Party Committee also paid attention to teacher training and regular teacher counseling and lesson preparation work. They mobilized a total of 177 literacy teachers to participate in Hanyu Pinyin learning and hired nine primary school teachers to undertake teaching work. The commune established a teaching and research group to help teachers prepare lessons collectively, study teaching materials and methods, and organize demonstration teaching, business lectures, and other activities. In the teaching process, the teachers collectively created many ways to analyze the shapes of characters and compiled many mnemonic rhymes and ballads for the Pinyin alphabet to help students memorize. At the same time, they mobilized the students to "write letters when their hands are idle and practice Pinyin when they see objects," which greatly inspired the students' interest and rapidly improved the quality of teaching.

    Now, the Fusuijing Commune has also built four new Pinyin reading material library stations, storing more than 8,000 books, and also runs a Pinyin newspaper. The staff of the library station are warmly welcomed by the masses every time they send books to factories and spare-time schools. Chairman Mao's works have become the most popular reading material among the masses. Cadres from the library station brought 35 Pinyin versions of "On Practice" to the commune's tarpaulin factory one time, and they were all borrowed at once. Li Fenglan, a worker at the factory, excitedly said, "In the past, I was illiterate. When I learned a little bit of politics, I would forget it as soon as I learned it. Now that I have learned Pinyin, I can also read Chairman Mao's 'On Practice,' which is really great!" Many newly literate childcare workers and teachers have read Pinyin reading materials related to their work and created children's songs and clapper rhymes for the children; everyone who participated in the learning felt that having culture opened their minds. Many people improved their operating methods and greatly improved production efficiency after learning culture. (Attached pictures)

    学万荣行动迅速　树榜样全面推广
    北京掀起群众性文化学习热潮
    福绥境公社四千多人投入注音识字运动
    新华社23日讯　北京市工矿企业和城乡人民公社认真贯彻“中共中央关于推广注音识字的指示”，正在为大规模地开展群众性注音识字运动进行各项准备工作。
    北京市从今年2月开始，首先广泛宣传和学习了万荣县注音识字的经验，为开展群众性注音识字运动打好思想基础，市教育局并邀请万荣县委文教部的负责干部给业余教育干部、教师作了报告，介绍万荣县注音识字运动开展的经验。接着，全市有关部门还组成参观小组，到万荣县去参观学习。他们回来以后，先后在市上召开的各种干部会上作了介绍。有些厂矿企业、城乡人民公社的业余学校还采取黑板报、广播等形式，广泛宣传了“中共中央关于推广注音识字的指示”和万荣县注音扫盲的经验，并且组织学员学习和讨论。西城、宣武、东城、朝阳等区都进行了注音识字的试验。试验证明：实行注音识字加快了扫盲的进度，提高了文盲学汉字的信心，巩固和扩大了扫盲成果，深受群众欢迎。西城区福绥境人民公社在2月底，学习了万荣县的经验，开展注音识字运动以来，基本上扫除了青壮年中的文盲、半文盲，目前正在开展一个群众性的读书写作运动。群众反映，学了汉语拼音就有了“靠山”，有了“永久的老师”。
    为了开展群众性注音识字运动，北京市从市、区到基层单位，层层训练了大批注音识字教师。西城、宣武、朝阳、东城等区，已经训练了近三千多名教师，市教育局还举办了注音识字教师训练班。给各区和部分厂矿企业培训一批骨干师资。许多试点单位，参加学习的学员学会了注音字母和拼音，又马上当了“小先生”教别人，使注音识字运动迅速开展。
    市、区教育局还为开展注音识字运动积极准备教材和通俗读物。西城、朝阳等区已经编出了一部分教材。市教育局也组织起一批教师，在中国文字改革委员会的帮助下，改编出工、农注音识字课本各一套。这个教材根据万荣县的经验，规定在学习中要使学员熟练地掌握汉语拼音字母和四百个音节；在教学过程中，要注意开展群众性的读写活动。市属的一些出版、印刷、图书发行部门，最近也专门研究了如何尽快地印出一批注音识字课本和读物，其中包括职工和农民注音识字扫盲课本、高小注音识字语文本和大量注音通俗读物、注音字典等。
    目前，西城、宣武等区的注音识字运动，已经从培训师资、重点试验，进入到在全区扫盲班和业余学校全面推广的新阶段。
    新华社23日讯　北京西城区福绥境人民公社学习山西省万荣县注音识字经验，抓得紧、行动快，从今年2月开始到现在，两个多月时间里，全公社七百一十四名文盲、半文盲中，已经有六百五十人扫盲结业。目前，他们正发动一个大量阅读和大量创作的群众运动，掀起向文化进军的新高潮。
    几年来，福绥境的街道扫盲工作在党的领导下取得了很大成绩。青壮年中的文盲已基本扫除，但回生的问题长期未能解决。据1959年检查，复盲率达30％左右。成立人民公社以后，街道妇女纷纷参加生产，她们对文化的要求更加迫切。今年2月12日，人民日报介绍了山西省万荣县注音识字的经验，福绥境公社党委迅速推广了这个经验，在短期内就收到很大效果。如民用灯具加工厂的工人靳霞，原来认识字极少，学会汉语拼音以后，只用两个多月的业余时间，就学完了一千五百字，听写成绩在八十分以上，还能写出二百到三百汉字的短文。五个孩子的妈妈张玉贞，曾经五次参加扫盲学习，都半途掉队。这次她只用了二十二个小时，就学会了汉语拼音，接着就阅读了拼音识字课本和六本拼音读物，很快地升入了高小班学习。现在全公社已经有四千多人投入了汉语拼音的学习运动，其中有文盲、半文盲，也有高小和初中、高中的学员。他们一致称赞汉语拼音是识字的“靠山”，是自己的“辅导老师”，并且热情地写诗歌赞道：“学习拼音不算难，努力刻苦去钻研，人人都来把它念，看书识字真方便。”
    公社党委的重视和积极加强领导，是取得成绩的主要原因。公社党委第一书记在百忙中深入工厂了解学员的学习情况，并用各种实例在干部中、教师中，做了深入的动员工作。各单位党支部采取措施保证学员的学习时间，如对参加汉语拼音学习的学员，做到了“保入学、保出席、保时间”。教师们也发扬了“服务站”的精神，利用学员们的生产空隙，随时随地给补课。这一切，使学员们深深体会到社会主义大家庭的温暖，学习热情更加高涨。
    公社党委还注意了师资培训和经常的教师辅导备课工作，他们共发动了一百七十七名扫盲教师参加汉语拼音学习，聘请了九个小学教师担任教学工作。公社成立了教研组，帮助教师集体备课，研究教材、教法，组织表演教学、业务讲座等活动。教师们在教学过程中集体创造了很多分析字形的办法，编了许多拼音字母的口诀、歌谣，帮助学员记忆，同时，发动学员“手闲写字母，见物练拼音”，大大启发了学员们的兴趣，教学质量迅速提高。
    现在，福绥境公社又新建了四个拼音读物图书站，贮备了八千多本书，还自办了拼音小报。图书站的工作人员每次送书到厂、到业余学校，都受到群众的热烈欢迎。毛主席著作已经成为广大群众最喜爱的读物，图书站的干部一次带了三十五本注音的“实践论”到公社的苫布厂，一下子就全被借光了。这个厂的职工李凤兰激动地说：“过去我不识字，学点政治，前脚学，后脚忘，现在，学会了拼音，我也能看毛主席的‘实践论’，真是太高兴了！”许多刚脱盲的保育员、教养员，阅读了和工作有关的拼音读物，为孩子们创作了儿歌、快板；所有参加学习的人都感觉到，有了文化，脑子开了窍。不少人学习了文化后，改进了操作方法，大大提高了生产效率。（附图片）
