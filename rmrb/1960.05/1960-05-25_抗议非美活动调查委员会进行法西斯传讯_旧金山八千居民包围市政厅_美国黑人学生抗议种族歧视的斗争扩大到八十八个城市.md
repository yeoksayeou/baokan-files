Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch from TASS: Eight thousand residents of San Francisco surrounded San Francisco City Hall on the 21st to protest the activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee, which was conducting fascist summonses there.

As soon as the committee announced its intention to conduct investigations in San Francisco, its activities were met with widespread protests and opposition. The teachers' union, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, and many other labor unions demanded the dissolution of the committee. Three hundred professors and faculty members at the University of California condemned the committee's activities. Several hundred faculty members from other colleges and universities in California also expressed their protests through newspapers. University students formed special groups to picket the locations where the committee held its meetings. Many civil groups also expressed their protests in different ways.

Residents from different walks of life also held rallies demanding the dissolution of the committee. The police attempted to suppress these protests with violence, beating the demonstrating masses, but the police brutality only aroused new protests. On the last day of the committee's investigation, five thousand people surrounded City Hall.

The committee's summonses were fruitless. Except for two professional informers, all thirty-six people summoned refused to answer the questions posed by the committee.

The committee came to San Francisco to intimidate progressive individuals and groups in California, but only succeeded in further disgracing this fascist organ of the U.S. Congress.

Xinhua News Agency, 24th dispatch: According to the latest issue of the New York "Worker's Weekly," the sit-in movement of Black students in the United States protesting racial discrimination has expanded to eighty-eight cities in sixteen southern and border states.

Students from fifty-three predominantly Black colleges and universities and thirteen high schools have participated in the movement. In nineteen of these cities, twenty-two white schools have also taken action. Over one thousand five hundred Black students and more than eighty white students have been arrested by the U.S. authorities.

The American people have expressed support for the Black students' sit-in movement. People in eighty-eight cities outside the southern states have taken sympathetic actions. Students (mainly white students) from one hundred and fourteen colleges have taken supporting actions, including sit-ins and picketing at restaurants and barber shops in Nevada, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

Local and regional organizations of the United Automobile Workers, the International Electrical Workers Union, the Amalgamated Meat Cutters, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, and the West Coast Longshoremen's Union have also taken actions to support the struggle of Black students.

Workers in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, cities in northern New Jersey, and San Francisco have also given support to the sit-in movement.

    旧金山八千居民包围市政厅
    美国黑人学生抗议种族歧视的斗争扩大到八十八个城市
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社讯：旧金山八千居民21日包围了旧金山市政厅，抗议在那里进行法西斯传讯的美国众议院非美活动调查委员会的活动。
    当这个委员会一宣布要在旧金山进行调查之后，它的这种活动就遭到了广泛的抗议和反对。教师工会、码头和仓库工人工会以及其他许多工会组织都要求解散这个委员会。加利福尼亚大学的三百名教授和教员谴责委员会的活动。加利福尼亚州其他一些高等学校的好几百名教员也通过报纸表示了抗议。大学生们组成专门小组，在委员会举行会议的地点布置纠察线。许多民间团体也都用不同方式表示了抗议。
    不同阶层的居民还举行了集会，要求解散这个委员会。警察试图用暴力压制这种抗议，殴打示威抗议的群众，但是，警察的暴行只是激起了新的抗议。在这个委员会进行调查的最后一天，有五千人包围了市政厅。
    委员会的传讯毫无结果。除了两个职业的告密者之外，三十六个被传讯的人都拒绝回答委员会向他们提出的问题。
    这个委员会到旧金山来，是为了对加利福尼亚州的进步人士和进步团体进行恐吓；但是却只使美国国会的这个法西斯机构再一次丢脸。
    新华社24日讯　据最新一期的纽约“工人周报”报道，美国黑人学生抗议种族歧视的静坐运动已经扩大到南部和边境的十六个州的八十八个城市。
    有五十三个黑人学生占多数的高等学院和大学和十三个中学的学生参加了这个运动。在这些城市的十九个城市中，有二十二个白人的学校也采取了行动。已经有一千五百个黑人学生和八十多个白人学生被美国当局逮捕。
    美国人民对黑人学生的静坐运动表示支持，在南部各州以外的八十八个城市的人民采取了同情的行动，一百一十四个高等学院的学生（主要是白人学生）采取了支持行动，这些行动包括对内华达、俄亥俄和宾夕法尼亚州的餐馆和理发店采取静坐行动和布置纠察线。
    联合汽车工人工会、国际电气工人工会、屠宰工人工会、混合成衣工人工会、国际妇女服装工人工会和西海岸码头工人工会的地方和地区组织也采取了支持黑人学生的斗争的行动。
    纽约、芝加哥、费城、波士顿、北新泽西州各城和旧金山的工人，也对静坐运动给予了支持。
