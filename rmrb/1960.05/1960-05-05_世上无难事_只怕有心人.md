Nothing Is Difficult in the World If You Put Your Heart Into It
By our correspondent in Kunming

Like the mass campaign for steelmaking in 1958, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is attracting millions of people in Kunming.

People are constantly thinking about innovation, in everything and every way; they think about it during the day, at night, during work hours, and even during breaks. Some people think about it to the point of "forgetting to take the basin when washing their face, going to the wrong door when going to bed, dropping the bowl when eating, and bumping into people while walking." Some people are inspired halfway through watching a movie and leave in the middle to work on innovation. Some are inspired by seeing elephants stretching their trunks at the zoo or seeing children's toys at the department store and come up with innovation projects. There are also cases of husbands helping wives, sons motivating fathers, and younger sisters inspiring older sisters to come up with innovations.

The "innovation craze" reflects the strong desire of the broad masses to change the backward state of technology. The "innovation craze" embodies the spirit of our times, and the "innovation craze" has become a glorious and proud title. The following are some of the thousands of "innovation enthusiasts" who have recently emerged in Kunming.

Inspiration from a Haircut

Sun Zhijun and Yang Hai, printing workers, walked into a barbershop to get haircuts. As soon as Sun Zhijun crossed the threshold, he was suddenly stunned. He saw the barber using electric clippers to cut a customer's hair, with a thick layer of loose hair piled on the clippers. He turned to Yang Hai and said, "Look, this is interesting!" Yang Hai immediately understood what he meant, and the two smiled knowingly and began to observe carefully.

It turned out that these two were workers in the printing workshop of the Yunnan Printing and Dyeing Factory. Recently, they had been racking their brains to create a shearing machine. They thought about it during the day, at night, during work, and even while eating, but they just couldn't find the way. For this matter, they went to the Yunnan Cigarette Factory three times to see the tobacco cutting machine, and then imitated the form of the tobacco cutting machine to manufacture a shearing machine. However, it could only cut hard materials, not soft ones. After twelve consecutive trials, the fluff still couldn't be cut off. Just as they were at a loss, the barber's electric clippers gave them inspiration. How could they not be overjoyed?

They didn't even get their hair cut. The two immediately ran to the secondhand stall to find electric clippers. They found the clippers and hurriedly disassembled them. Their minds were suddenly opened. A few days later, a shearing machine was born.

On a Songhua River Brand Bus

Shu Mingyuan, a female apprentice worker at the Kunming Electric Motor Factory, has been very excited these days. The factory's technical innovation is in full swing, and she thought that because the labor efficiency of the punching and shearing section of her transformer workshop was not high, it often needed support from others. At the same time, manual feeding and unloading on the punch and shear machines were not safe. If automatic feeding and unloading could be realized, the production outlook of the punching and shearing section would be completely changed.

Whether eating, walking, or resting, she was thinking about this issue. Once, on a holiday trip to the city, she was sitting on a Songhua River brand bus when she saw the conductor press a switch when the bus arrived at a stop, and the bus door automatically flashed open to both sides. This extremely ordinary phenomenon in daily life made Shu Mingyuan overjoyed. The principle of automatic opening and closing of bus doors made her think of the automatic unloading of the shear machine.

On her second day off, Shu Mingyuan took the Songhua River brand bus again. As soon as she got on the bus, she didn't look for a seat. She stared intently at the door. As she watched, she suddenly became disappointed. Because the bus door was vertical, while the movable table surface of the shear machine's automatic feeding should be horizontal, how could it be used? Soon she blamed herself again: "How can you be so stupid? The door is fixed, but people are flexible! Wouldn't turning the door upside down make it a movable table surface?"

For the automation of the shear machine, Shu Mingyuan tried to get on the Songhua River brand bus for the third time. She had a lot of questions in her mind that she hadn't figured out yet, such as how is the bus door constructed? The bus switch is controlled by people. What is used to control it on the shear machine? So she mustered the courage to ask the conductor the question, "Why does this door open and close automatically?" Unfortunately, the conductor couldn't meet her request.

After getting off the bus, Shu Mingyuan walked down the street while thinking. Suddenly, she stopped in front of a clock shop, lost in thought again. Seeing the clock in the shop ticking "tick-tock," she was extremely happy. Why does the clock move by itself? Why does it chime at certain times? Why does it chime once at one o'clock and twice at two o'clock? Can't the principle of the clock also be used to control the automatic shear machine? Shu Mingyuan was so obsessed with the automation of the shear machine.

After the factory Party committee understood her wishes, it immediately sent two technicians to help her design drawings, and also transferred three master workers from the machine repair workshop to help her trial-produce this new equipment. With the support of the entire factory, after more than a hundred experiments, the automation of the shear machine was finally successful. This not only greatly reduced the labor intensity of the workers, but also saved nine laborers.

A "Mechanical Hand"

Yu Bin, Zhao Guangrong, and Li Mulin, famous advanced workers at the Kunming Machine Tool Factory, sat silently facing each other. It turned out that they had encountered a "stumbling block" in the automated production line of screws—they couldn't make a mechanical hand.

After dozens of experiments, more than twenty scrapped "mechanical hands" were thrown on the ground. Each time they failed, Wu Chaonan, the secretary of the workshop Party branch, encouraged them not to lose heart and to continue trying.

This day, the experiment failed again. "Why is this hand always having problems and can't be made?" Just as they were sitting and thinking about this problem, the clerk came to deliver the meal tickets. Yu Bin saw the ticket clip in the clerk's hand and grabbed it. He pinched the ticket clip open and closed, scattering the meal tickets all over the floor. Pinching it back and forth, Li Mulin suddenly said happily, "That's right! Let's imitate this clip and give it a shot."

With nervous and excited feelings, they installed the newly made "mechanical hand." Suddenly, everyone's faces changed. The experiment had failed again.

The experiment had been going on for more than seventy times, and it was still unsuccessful. The three men looked at each other's hands, comparing them with their own hands over and over again. They were a little strange: human hands are so flexible, but it is so difficult to make a "mechanical hand." As they compared, Yu Bin pulled Li Mulin's hand and placed it on the machine tool, then pinched his hand and moved it back and forth, once, twice... "Ah, it works!" Yu Bin jumped up with joy.

Five hours later, a "mechanical hand" made to resemble Li Mulin's hand was installed on the machine and began to move. An automated production line also appeared in the machine tool factory.

Now, the "innovation craze" has spread from industry, transportation, and basic construction departments to finance and trade, services, canteens, and government schools, and has become popular in all walks of life and every corner. At the loading and unloading construction site, it is "put down the carrying pole and start the machine, the porters are overjoyed." In the bank, people have realized "no need for pens for bookkeeping, no need for hands for counting money." In department stores, it is now "no need for rulers to measure cloth, no need to walk to choose cloth." In the past, shoemakers had "four treasures for making shoes: marking knives, awls, nail hammers, and pliers were indispensable." Now, "get rid of the awl handle and realize mechanization; no need for knives to cut the sole, no need for awls to sew the shoe, no need for hammers to flatten the sole, pliers are outdated." Things that people have longed for for many years have been realized in just a few months, a few weeks, or a few days! How many things that predecessors have not done or dared to do have been done in the hands of our generation!

    世上无难事　只怕有心人
    本报驻昆明记者
    像1958年大办钢铁的全民运动一样，技术革新和技术革命运动正吸引着昆明市的千百万群众。
    人们时时想革新，事事想革新，白天想，夜里想，工作时间想，休息时也想。有人想得“洗脸忘拿盆，睡觉走错门，吃饭掉了碗，走路撞着人”的程度。有看电影看到半场，突然得到启发，中途退场去搞革新的。有在动物园里看见大象伸缩鼻子，或是在百货商店里看见儿童玩具受到启发搞出革新项目的。还有丈夫帮助妻子、儿子带动了父亲、妹妹启发了姐姐搞出革新来的。
    “革新迷”反映了广大群众要求改变技术落后面貌的强烈愿望，“革新迷”体现了我们时代的精神面貌，“革新迷”已成为光荣和骄傲的称号。下面介绍的是昆明市最近涌现出来的千百个“革新迷”中的几个。
    理发的启发
    印花工人孙致钧和杨海走进了一家理发室，准备理个发。孙致钧一跨进门槛，突然给怔住了。只见理发员拿着电剪正在给顾客理发；剪刀上堆着厚绒绒一层碎头发。他回过头来对杨海说：“你瞧，这多有意思！”杨海马上领会了他的意思，两人会心地一笑，就留心地察看起来。
    原来这两个人是云南印染厂印花车间的工人，最近为了搞一台剪绒机，真是挖空了心思。他们白天想，夜里想，工作时想，吃饭时也想，就是找不到门道。为此事，他们三次到云南纸烟厂去看切烟机，回来就仿照切烟机的形式制造了剪绒机。可是，切起来只能切硬的，不能切软的。一连试验了十二次，绒始终剪不下来。正在束手无策的时候，理发的电剪却给他们带来了启示。这怎能不叫他们欣喜若狂呢？
    他们连发也没有理，两个人马上跑到旧货摊上去找电剪。电剪找到了，急忙拆开来一看，思想豁然开朗。几天之后，一台剪绒机就诞生了。
    在松花江牌汽车上
    昆明电机厂的女学徒工束明媛这几天心情非常激动。厂里的技术革新正搞得轰轰烈烈，她想到自己所在的变压器车间冲剪工段因为劳动效率不高，经常需要别人支援。同时，冲床和剪床上人工上料退料也不安全，如果能实现喂料退料自动化，那么冲剪工段的生产面貌就会彻底改观了。
    不论吃饭、走路和休息，她都在想这个问题。有一次放假进城，她坐在松花江牌公共汽车上，看见汽车到站时，售票员一按开关，汽车门就自动地向两边闪开。这个在日常生活中极为平常的现象，却使束明媛喜出望外。汽车门自动开关的原理，却使她联想到剪床的自动退料。
    第二次休假，束明媛又坐上了松花江牌的公共汽车。她一上车，也不找座位，全神贯注地瞧着那扇门。瞧着瞧着，她突然失望了。因为汽车门是竖的，而剪床自动喂料的活动台面应该是横的，怎么用得上呢？很快她又责备起自己来：“你怎么这样笨，门是死的，人是活的呀！把门倒下来不是就成了活动台面了吗？”
    为了剪床自动化，束明媛第三次设法坐上了松花江牌公共汽车。她脑子里有一大堆问题还没有弄清楚，如汽车门到底是怎样构造的？汽车开关是由人控制，剪床上用什么来控制呢？……于是她鼓起勇气向售票员提出了“这门为什么会自动开关”的问题。可惜售票员无法满足她的要求。
    下了公共汽车，束明媛在街上一面走一面想。突然，在一家钟表店门前，她又出神地站住了。看见店里“滴答、滴答”响着的大钟，她高兴极了。钟表为什么会自己走呢？为什么在一定的时间会敲出钟点来呢？为什么一点钟一定敲一下，两点钟一定敲两下呢？钟的原理不是也可以用来控制自动剪床吗？束明媛想剪床自动化想得入迷了。
    厂党委了解了她的愿望以后，立刻派了两个技术人员帮助她设计绘图，又从机修车间抽调了三个老师傅帮助她试制这种新设备。在全厂的支援下，经过一百多次的试验，剪床自动化终于成功了。这不仅大大减轻了工人的劳动强度，而且还节约了九个劳动力。
    一只“机械手”
    昆明机床厂的著名先进工人俞斌和赵光荣、李木林默默无言地对坐着。原来他们在搞螺丝钉的自动化生产线中碰到一只“拦路虎”——机械手搞不出来。
    试验了几十次，地上丢了二十多只报废了的“机械手”。每失败一次，车间党支部书记吴朝南同志就鼓励他们不要灰心，要继续试下去。
    这天，又试验失败了。“为什么这只手老是毛病百出，搞不成呢？”他们正坐着想这问题的时候，事务员送饭票来了。俞斌一眼看见事务员手中夹饭票的票夹，一把便夺了过来，把饭票夹子捏得一开一闭的，饭票撒了个满地。捏来捏去，李木林忽然高兴地说：“对！就仿这夹子干他一家伙。”
      他们怀着又紧张又兴奋的心情，把新做的“机械手”安上去。忽然，大家的脸色都变了，试验又没有成功。
    试验进行到七十多次了，总是搞不成。三个人一个看着一个的手，互相用手比起来，比了不知多少遍，他们有些奇怪：人的手这么灵活，可是要搞个“机械手”却偏偏是这么困难。比着比着，俞斌拉着李木林的手安在机床上，然后捏着他的手前后活动，一下、两下……“啊，行了！”俞斌高兴得纵身跳了起来。
    五个小时以后，一只仿李木林的手做成的“机械手”安在机器上动起来了。一条自动化的生产线也在机床厂出现了。
    现在，“革新迷”的风气已由工业、交通、基本建设部门发展到财贸、服务、食堂和机关学校，普及到各行各业的各个角落。在搬运装卸工地是“放下扁担开机器，搬运工人喜洋洋。”在银行，人们实现了“记账不用笔，点钞不用手”。在百货商店，现在是“量布不用尺，选布不用走。”制鞋工人过去是“做鞋四件宝，划刀、锥子、钉锤、钳子少不了”。现在“甩掉锥子把，实现机械化；切底不用刀，绱鞋不用锥，平底不用锤，钳子过时了。”多少年来人们向往的事情在短短几个月、几个星期、几天内就实现了！有多少件前人没有做过也不敢想做的事情，在我们这一代人的手中做出来了呵！
