Report from the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee to the Central Committee on Popularizing the Experience of Wanrong County in Promoting Pinyin Literacy Throughout the Province to Strive to Become a Province Free of Illiteracy Ahead of Schedule

To the Central Committee:

The situation and experience of Wanrong County in carrying out the Pinyin literacy campaign are reported as follows:

Wanrong County has consistently attached importance to the work of eliminating illiteracy in the past ten years. Since 1958, due to the great development of production and the great liberation of people's minds, the enthusiasm of the masses for learning culture has become increasingly high. Everywhere you can hear discussions like: "Water conservancy and mechanization cannot be realized without culture." However, the masses want culture but are also afraid of culture. This is why the phenomenon of relapse after literacy is very serious. By October 1958, more than 34,000 young and middle-aged illiterate people had been eliminated in the county, but more than 12,000 people relapsed. These people call themselves "graduated illiterates." Even those who have become literate find it difficult to consolidate and expand the results of literacy due to their limited literacy, making reading and writing difficult. In view of this situation, the Wanrong County Party Committee studied in October 1958 how to make a great leap forward in the work of eliminating illiteracy and spare-time education to meet the needs of the great leap forward in production. Therefore, it was decided to promote the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme throughout the county and adopt the method of Pinyin literacy to carry out the campaign to eliminate illiteracy and spare-time education at high speed. After several months of key experiments, the effect was very good. However, because the Party did not have a unified ideological understanding of the Pinyin literacy method at that time, when this experience was promoted in 1959, it showed a phenomenon of ups and downs and insufficient momentum for a considerable period of time. By October 1959, the County Party Committee further summarized the experience of Pinyin literacy, criticized erroneous ideas, and after making full preparations, it launched a high tide of Pinyin literacy for all people to teach and learn in the county. Among the 210,000 people in the county, 140,000 people were involved in the movement to learn the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme and achieved unexpected results. In just two months, by the end of December 1959, all 13,246 young and middle-aged illiterate people in the county (including relapsed illiterates and remaining illiterates) were freed from illiteracy, and the county became a young and middle-aged illiterate-free county ahead of schedule. 24,000 elderly illiterate people also automatically participated in literacy learning. Among them, 240 people have become literate, and more than 9,300 people have mastered the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. And 107,000 people can speak Mandarin.

The peasants jumped over the threshold of literacy and marched towards the cultural revolution in great strides. The spare-time education movement developed like bamboo shoots after a rain. Up to now, more than 52,000 young and middle-aged people in the county have participated in spare-time senior primary school classes, and more than 9,600 people have participated in spare-time junior high school classes. The total number of these two items reaches 86.5% of the total number of young and middle-aged people, accounting for 94% of the number of people who should participate. In the blink of an eye, a social atmosphere of mass reading, buying books, borrowing books, and writing has formed. In December 1959 alone, the county sold 180,000 copies of Pinyin reading materials, and ordered 240,000 copies, but still could not meet the needs of the masses. In the rural areas of Wanrong, the new phenomenon of book shortage actually appeared. The library of Qinggu Management Area of Wangxian People's Commune originally had more than 700 books, but less than half of them were borrowed in the past. Now, all more than 7,000 books have been borrowed. In the past, one person borrowed one book, but now one person borrows several, or even more than a dozen books. In the past, people borrowed books alone, but now they borrow books from household to household. In the past, people liked to borrow comic strips and picture books, but now people are rushing to borrow "Selected Works of Mao Zedong", "On the Cultivation of Communists", "Tracks in the Snowy Forest" and other big books. Here, many peasant poets and peasant writers have emerged rapidly. Men, women, old, young, speak freely and write eloquently. In less than a year, more than 1.9 million poems were created in the county. Li Taibo, 47, wrote more than 20,000 words of "Fragments of My Life." Wang Minying, an 18-year-old young woman, wrote more than 20,000 words of "History of Qinggu Village." Dong Yuxiang, a mother of three children, is determined to work hard for ten years and strive to become a college student. It is really talent, flowers and fruits, great talent and lofty ambitions. Not only that, now there are 8,755 illiterate peasants in the county who have formed 322 groups to study Mao Zedong's works. In Liucun Management Area of Ronghe People's Commune, only 12 people studied theory last year, but now it has expanded to 800 people. After they studied the article "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" in the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, everyone's thinking suddenly became clear, and they understood how to treat new things. The number of people participating in public canteens suddenly expanded to more than 95%. Mao Zedong Thought is rapidly arming the minds of the peasants, thereby increasingly transforming into a material force to promote the progress of the entire work.

The experience of Wanrong County proves that the method of Pinyin literacy is a good way to eliminate illiteracy quickly, economically and effectively, consolidate and expand the results of literacy, and is a shortcut to accelerate the intellectualization of the working class. Using Pinyin letters to eliminate illiteracy, young people can learn the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme in general with 15 to 20 hours of Pinyin teaching; adults can learn with 25 to 30 hours of Pinyin teaching; after about 120 to 150 hours of reading and writing teaching, they can recognize 1,500 Chinese characters and reach the standard of literacy. Moreover, after mastering the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme to reach the literacy standard, they can read a large number of Pinyin reading materials and practice writing without being restricted by the number of characters they know. They can learn by themselves, infer from one instance, teach and learn from each other, so that the mass learning movement can be carried out more easily, widely, and persistently. In January of this year, Qinggu Management Area of Wangxian Commune in the county conducted a test on 101 students who graduated from Pinyin literacy in the second half of 1958. 42 people consolidated 1,500 characters and increased about 500 characters, accounting for 41.6%; 51 people maintained 1,500 characters, accounting for 50.5%; only 8 people recognized about 1,000 characters, accounting for 7.9%. The few students with poor consolidation were mainly because they did not study regularly and read fewer popular reading materials. At that time, a test was also conducted on students who did not graduate from Pinyin literacy, and the phenomenon of relapse reached more than 64%. In the process of literacy, Wanrong County also formed a social atmosphere of speaking Mandarin. Therefore, the masses summarized the benefits of Pinyin literacy as: "Pinyin letters are the key, they are the teachers of Chinese characters, the key is like a happy mirror, and all illiterates are swept away." "Pinyin literacy is a good method, one tree blooms two flowers, one takes off the illiteracy hat, and the other learns Mandarin."

The experience of Wanrong County also proves that the promotion of Pinyin literacy provides good conditions for reforming the spare-time education of industry and agriculture and the school system of full-time primary school education, and shortening the teaching years. Last November, they changed to textbooks with Pinyin letters in some spare-time education and full-time primary school education. In terms of teaching methods, the textbooks were divided into several units from shallow to deep, and key lessons were selected for detailed explanation in each unit, while strengthening reading and writing guidance, which greatly shortened the time for Chinese language teaching. In the past, it generally took three years to complete the Chinese language course, but now it can be completed in less than a year. The time for Chinese language class is shortened, so political, mathematics and science and technology courses can be added. Now the county is already experimenting with a one-year system in spare-time senior primary schools and a four-year system in complete primary schools in five autumn start classes and thirty spring start classes. In addition, the effect of adding Pinyin letters and Pinyin literacy experiments in the senior classes of kindergartens in the county is also good.

Wanrong County has achieved such remarkable results in carrying out literacy and spare-time education using Pinyin literacy methods, which, like other things, has gone through ideological struggles. At the beginning, some people had many doubts about the Pinyin literacy method and had no confidence; they also raised a lot of difficulties to the policy of launching mass movements, thinking that this would not work and that would not work. However, the Wanrong County Party Committee resolutely eliminated all pessimistic arguments and resolutely implemented the policy of putting politics in command, boldly mobilizing the masses, and launching mass movements. Party committees at all levels were led by the first secretary, and the Party, government, army and people all worked together to establish special management agencies at all levels, and organized and led the Pinyin literacy movement from top to bottom. The county established a Language Reform Committee, each people's commune established a branch of the Language Reform Committee, and the management area established a guidance group; and organized a team of more than 230 full-time cadres in the county to use the method of "small field experiment, large field promotion", on-site observation, and exchange of experience to comprehensively spread from point to surface. However, to carry out such a large-scale mass movement, the first problem encountered was the lack of teachers. Indeed, at that time, there were only two Pinyin teachers in Wanrong County, and the teaching force was too small. This is also a basis for all pessimistic arguments. However, this problem did not scare people with great ambitions. They used the policy of launching mass movements and taking the mass line, and adopted the snowball method. The county and commune were responsible for the division of labor, training backbones at all levels, establishing teaching stations in each commune, establishing teaching and research groups in each area, primary school teachers teaching mass teachers, students teaching literacy students, activists acting as "little teachers", full-time teachers and part-time teachers closely combining, teaching and learning at the same time, learning and teaching at the same time, everyone is a teacher, everyone is a student. In this way, from scratch, from small to large, rolling more and more, the county trained 2,000 teachers and 3,500 instructors in a few months. From then on, a massive literacy learning movement of "people teach people" was launched throughout the county. "Relatives teach relatives, neighbors teach neighbors, children teach parents, and grandparents ask grandchildren if they don't understand" are common examples. Xue Zhenping and Qu Lingxian from Zhouwang Village are a couple. They helped each other and competed with each other in their studies. In 20 days, they both took off their illiteracy hats and became educated people at the same time. Jia Huimiao, a young woman from Nanniuchi Village, took off her illiteracy hat and taught her four-year-old daughter Jia Qiulian more than 40 Pinyin letters. At the on-site conference on promoting Pinyin literacy in the province, the mother and daughter performed Pinyin literacy, winning the praise of the audience. After the teacher problem was solved, solving the textbook problem was also an important matter. In addition to some Pinyin reading materials issued by the higher authorities, they mainly adopted the method of self-reliance, compiled more than 20,000 copies of Pinyin textbooks, and mobilized the masses to compile supplementary teaching materials, and also created a "Wanrong Pinyin Newspaper" with a circulation of 9,000 copies per issue. In addition, they added Pinyin letters to farm tools, slogans, wall poems, institutions, and signs hung at the entrance of schools, forming a literacy environment where teaching materials were everywhere and "Pinyin characters surrounded illiterates."

Will a large-scale mass literacy learning movement hinder production? Those who speak pessimistic and discouraging words also gave a negative answer. The Wanrong County Party Committee adopted the method of unified arrangement, unified deployment, and close combination of learning and production. In addition to dividing literacy students into classes according to different levels and attending classes regularly, they also compiled field learning groups, kangtou teaching groups, feeder learning groups, and water conservancy construction site learning groups according to the professional teams and work groups in production, advocating that they should bring a bag (mobile book bag) and four treasures (books, water pens, notebooks, newspapers) when going to the field for production, so that they can learn whenever they have time. Moreover, the learning methods change with the change of agricultural seasons and the change of production activity forms, which are diverse and flexible. In this way, literacy learning not only did not hinder production, but also promoted the great development of production with the immediate results of the people's learning of culture. Facts have proved that many learning activists are also models in the "red, diligent, skillful, and thrifty" movement. The peasants, as the masters of culture, have become smarter and more capable. Cheng Kuanniu, a 25-year-old youth in Qinggu Village, was dull and backward in the past. Others called him "Mengkuaier." However, after he took off his illiteracy hat, he completely turned into another person. People said: "Mengkuaier is enlightened." Now Cheng Kuanniu has recognized more than 3,000 characters, read more than 200 books, and wrote a 30,000-word "autobiography." At present, he is reading "On Contradiction" and "My Family." After reading the book "Liu Jiemei Forgets Her Roots," he felt that he had also forgotten the pain after the scar healed, and he was very ashamed, which greatly enlightened his political consciousness. After learning "Heini Planting Cotton" and a set of science and technology pamphlets, he planted a cotton experimental field himself, and as a result, he created a high-yield record that was twice as high as the local yield. Due to the double leap forward in his thinking and production, Cheng Kuanniu was elected as the production team leader and the principal of the team's Red and Expert School, and joined the Communist Party. There are more than just Cheng Kuanniu who have been enlightened. Peasants who have taken off their illiteracy hats are marching towards the technical revolution while marching towards the cultural revolution, and they want to fight to completely change the backward production outlook. Now, combined with production organizations and production bases, all kinds of science and technology learning organizations have been established throughout the county. More than 63,000 people in the county have participated in this kind of learning organization, including 26,700 people studying cotton cultivation technology, 14,200 people studying soil, 2,100 people studying animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and 2,800 people studying agricultural machinery. Seven communes in the county have established seven key scientific research projects, and a total of 1,630 people have been selected to form professional production teams (also learning excellent classes), concentrating labor and concentrating learning to train the backbone of science and technology. Now the de-illiterate young and middle-aged people in each commune and management area have played a great role in the technical revolution movement. For example, the workers of the soil fertilizer plant in Sunji Management Area have successfully imitated more than ten kinds of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium mixed fertilizer and other soil fertilizers after reading Chinese Pinyin science and technology books. Wang Sanwa, a worker at the Sunji Commune Comprehensive Processing Plant, successfully imitated a wheat cleaning machine after 13 days of painstaking research. The machine can clean more than 10,000 catties of wheat a day, which is 25 times more efficient than manual wheat cleaning. From many facts, it can be completely seen that the upsurge of the cultural revolution in Wanrong County is already promoting the emergence of the upsurge of the technical revolution. The cultural revolution and the technical revolution go hand in hand and leap forward together, which will surely push the sustained and high-speed great leap forward in production to a newer stage.

In order to promote the experience of Wanrong County, we held an on-site meeting in Wanrong County last December with a total of 600 people participating, including educational administrative cadres, Communist Youth League cadres, and middle and primary school principals and teachers from various special districts, cities, and counties. Responsible comrades from the Central Language Reform Committee and the All-China Women's Federation and more than 80 representatives from 14 provinces (regions) including Heilongjiang, Fujian, Sichuan, Gansu, and Inner Mongolia were also invited to participate. This meeting vigorously promoted the work of eliminating illiteracy and spare-time education in the province. At present, the progress of this work is good. According to incomplete statistics, more than 67,600 Pinyin teachers have been trained in the province, and more than 3.28 million people have participated in Chinese Pinyin learning, of which one-half have reached the standard of being able to recognize, spell, and write. In the Jinan Special District, more than 1.14 million peasants have participated in Pinyin learning, exceeding the total number of 1.13 million young and middle-aged people in the district. More than 80,000 elderly people have voluntarily participated in spare-time learning, which is four times more than before the promotion of Chinese Pinyin. Now, we have made a comprehensive plan to strive to achieve a province without illiteracy greatly ahead of schedule. At the same time, we have organized several pilot projects for school system reform to further create experience for teaching revolution. We are also preparing to compile and print a large number of Pinyin popular reading materials on politics, technology, and literature and art to meet the needs of the nationwide literacy and spare-time education movement that is rapidly unfolding.

    注音识字是加速工农群众知识化的捷径
    山西省委关于在全省推广万荣县注音识字经验争取提前成为无盲省向中央的报告中央：
    现将万荣县开展注音识字运动的情况和经验报告如下：
    万荣县在过去十年来，对于扫除文盲的工作是一贯重视的。从1958年以来，由于生产的大发展，人们思想的大解放，群众学习文化的劲头越来越高涨。到处可以听到这样的议论：“水利化、机械化，没有文化不能化。”但是群众想文化又怕文化。这就是扫盲毕业之后，回生复盲的现象非常严重。到1958年10月止，全县共扫除青壮年文盲三万四千多人，而回生复盲的便有一万二千多人。这些人自称他们是
  “毕业了的文盲”。即使已经脱盲的人，也因识字有限，阅读和写作都有困难，不易巩固和扩大扫盲成果。万荣县委针对这种情况，在1958年10月间便研究如何使扫除文盲和业余教育工作也来个大跃进，以适应生产大跃进形势的需要。于是决定在全县推行汉语拼音方案，采用注音识字的办法，高速度地开展扫除文盲和业余教育运动。经过几个月的重点试验，其效果本来是很好的。但由于当时党内对注音扫盲这个办法在思想认识上不够一致，因而当1959年推广这一经验时，在相当长的时间内，表现了时起时落、劲头不足的现象。到了1959年10月，县委进一步总结了注音扫盲的经验，批判了错误的思想，并且在作了充分的准备之后，一鼓作气，便在全县范围内掀起了万民教、全民学的注音扫盲高潮，全县二十一万人中就有十四万人卷入学习汉语拼音的运动中来，并且取得了预想不到的成效。仅仅在两个月的时间内，即到1959年12月底，全县一万三千二百四十六个青壮年文盲（包括复盲和剩余文盲），全部脱离文盲状态，提前实现了青壮年无盲县。二万四千个老年文盲也自动参加了扫盲学习。其中有二百四十人已经脱盲，九千三百多人掌握了汉语拼音方案。并且有十万七千人可以说普通话了。
    农民跳过了扫盲识字的门槛，便大踏步地向文化革命进军。业余教育运动，就像雨后春笋般地发展起来。到现在为止，全县青壮年参加业余高小班的达到五万二千多人，参加业余初中班的达到九千六百多人。两项人数合计，达到青壮年总数的86.5％，占应参加人数的94％。转眼之间，群众性的看书、买书、借书、写作形成了社会风气。1959年12月一个月，全县仅注音读物一项，即销售了十八万册，预订了二十四万册，但仍不能满足群众的需要。在万荣农村里，居然出现了闹书荒这样的新鲜事。王显人民公社青谷管理区图书室原有七百余册书，过去出借的不到一半，现在有七千余册书全被借光了。过去借书是一人一本，现在一借就是几本、甚至十几本。过去借书是单人借，现在是一户一户的借。过去人们借书，爱借连环画、小人书，现在人们却争先恐后地抢着借“毛泽东选集”、“论共产党员的修养”、“林海雪原”等大本本书了。在这里，迅速地涌现出了许多农民诗人，农民作家。男的，女的，老的，少的，随心所至，出口成章。不到一年时间，全县创作了一百九十多万首诗。四十七岁的李太柏，写出了两万多字的“我的生活片断”。十八岁的青年妇女王民英，写成两万多字的“青谷村变迁史”。三个孩子的妈妈董玉香，决心要苦练十年，争取变成大学生。真是才华茂密，花果满枝，雄才大略，壮志凌云。不仅如此，现在全县已经有八千七百五十五个脱盲农民，组成三百二十二个学习毛泽东著作的小组。荣河人民公社刘村管理区，去年只有十二人学习理论，现在扩大到八百人。他们学过毛泽东选集中“星星之火，可以燎原”一文以后，大家的思想顿时开朗，懂得了如何对待新鲜事物，参加公共食堂的人数突然扩大到95％以上。毛泽东思想正在迅速地武装着农民的思想，从而越来越大地转变为推动整个工作前进的物质力量。
    万荣县的经验证明，注音识字的办法，是多快好省地扫除文盲、巩固和扩大扫盲成果的好办法，是加速工农群众知识化的捷径。利用拼音字母扫盲，青年人一般用十五到二十小时、壮年人用二十五到三十小时的拼音教学，就可以学会汉语拼音方案；再经过大约一百二十个到一百五十个小时的阅读和写作的教学，就可以识汉字一千五百个，达到扫盲的标准。而且在掌握了汉语拼音这个工具达到扫盲标准之后，就可以不受识字数目的限制，大量阅读注音读物，练习写作，就可以无师自学，举一反三，互教互学，从而使群众性的学习运动更加容易广泛地、持久地开展起来。今年1月，该县王显公社青谷管理区把1958年下半年用注音识字办法毕业的一百零一个学员进行了一次测验，巩固住一千五百字又增识五百字左右的有四十二人，占41.6％，保持住一千五百字的五十一人，占50.5％，认得一千字左右的只有八人，占7.9％。这少数巩固较差的学员，主要是因为学习不经常、阅读通俗读物少的缘故。当时对没有用注音扫盲办法毕业的学员。也作了一次测验，回生现象竟达到64％以上。在扫盲过程中，万荣县说普通话也形成了社会风气。所以群众总结注音识字的好处是：“拼音字母是钥匙，它给汉字当老师，钥匙好比开心镜，所有文盲都扫尽。”“注音识字好办法，一树开下两朵花，一朵摘掉文盲帽，一朵学会普通话。”
    万荣县的经验还证明，推行注音识字的办法，对于改革工农业余教育和全日制小学教育的学制，缩短教学年限，提供了良好的条件。去年11月他们在一些业余教育和全日制小学教育中改用了注有拼音字母的课本，在教学方法上把课本由浅入深地划成几个单元，每个单元选择重点课进行精讲，同时加强阅读和写作指导，这样就大大缩短了语文教学的时间。过去一般用三年时间才可以学完的语文课，现在用不到一年的时间就可以学完了。语文课的时间缩短了，就能够加多政治、数学和科学技术等课程。现在该县已经在业余高小的一年制，在五个秋季始业班和三十个春季始业班的完全小学中实验小学四年制。此外，该县在幼儿园大班中加授拼音字母和注音识字的试验，其效果也是良好的。
    万荣县采用注音识字办法，进行扫除文盲和业余教育工作取得如此显著的成绩，它和其他事情一样，是经过思想斗争的。开始，有些人对拼音扫盲办法，怀疑挺多，没有信心；对大搞群众运动的方针，也提出一堆困难，认为这也不行，那也不行。但是，万荣县委坚决地排除了各种悲观论调，坚决地实行政治挂帅、放手发动群众、大搞群众运动的方针。各级党委由第一书记挂帅，党政军民一齐动手，层层成立专管机构，一竿到底地组织领导注音扫盲运动。县成立了文字改革委员会，各人民公社设文字改革委员会分会，管理区设指导小组；并且在全县范围内组织了一支二百三十多人的专职干部队伍，运用“小田试验，大田推广”，现场观摩，交流经验的办法，由点到面地全面铺开。但是，要开展这样一个大规模的群众运动，首先碰到了一个师资缺乏的问题。的确，当时万荣县只有两个拼音教师，师资力量实在太小了。这也是一切悲观论调的一个根据。可是，这个难题，并没有把有雄心大志的人们吓倒。他们运用了大搞群众运动，大走群众路线的方针，采取了滚雪球的办法。县、社分工负责，层层培训骨干，社社成立传授站，区区成立教研组，小学教师包教群众教师，学生包教扫盲学员，积极分子当“小先生”，专职教师和业余教师紧密结合，边教边学，边学边教，人人是先生，人人是学生。就是这样从无到有，由小到大，越滚越多，越滚越大，几个月的时间，全县便培训了两千名教师，三千五百名辅导员。从此，一个声势浩大的“民教民”的扫盲学习运动在全县范围内掀动起来了。“亲教亲，邻教邻，子女包教父母亲，爷爷不懂问孙孙”的事例到处皆是。周王村薛振平和屈伶仙是夫妇俩，他（她）们在学习中互相帮助，互相比赛，在二十天的时间内，两个人同时摘掉了文盲帽子，变成了有文化的人。南牛池村青年妇女贾惠苗，自己摘掉了文盲帽子，还教会四岁的女儿贾秋联四十多个拼音字母。在全省推行注音扫盲现场会议上，母女俩进行了拼音识字表演，博得观众个个赞口不绝。师资问题解决了，解决教材问题也是一件重要事。除了上级发给一部分注音读物外，他们主要采取自力更生的办法，自编了两万余册注音教材，并发动群众自编补充教材，还创办了每期发行九千份的“万荣拼音小报”。另外，他们在农具上、标语上、墙头诗歌、机关、学校门口挂的牌子上，都加了拼音字母，形成一个遍地是教材，“注音文字包围文盲”的识字环境。
    大搞群众性的扫盲学习运动，会不会妨碍生产？说悲观泄气话的人也作了否定的答复。万荣县委采用学习和生产统一安排、统一部署、紧密结合的办法，除把扫盲学员按程度不同划分开班级，定时上课以外，又按生产中的专业队和作业组，分别编成地头学习组、炕头包教组、饲养员学习组、水利工地学习组，提倡下地生产要带一包（流动图书包）、四宝（书、水笔、抄写本、报纸），做到书不离身，抽空就学。而且学习的方式，随着农事季节的转换，生产活动形式的改变而改变，多样灵活。就是这样，扫盲学习不仅没有妨碍了生产，而且人民群众学习文化的成果，立竿见影地推动了生产的大发展。事实证明，许多学习积极分子同时就是“红勤巧俭”运动中的模范。农民当了文化的主人，表现得更聪明、更能干了。青谷村二十五岁的青年程宽牛，在过去性格迟钝，思想落后，别人称他是“闷块”。但是当他脱掉文盲帽子以后，完全变成另外一个人了。人们都说：“闷块开窍啦”。现在的程宽牛已经识到三千多字，读了二百多本书，还写了三万字的“自传”。眼下他正在读“矛盾论”和“我的一家”。他读了“刘介梅忘本”一书以后，感到自己也是好了伤疤忘了痛，心里十分惭愧，大大启发了他的政治觉悟。他学了“黑妮种棉”和一套科学技术小册子以后，自己种了一块棉花试验田，结果创造出高于当地产量两倍的高产纪录。由于他的思想和生产双跃进，程宽牛被选为生产队长和队的红专学校校长，并且加入了共产党。闷块开了窍的人，何止是程宽牛。脱了文盲帽子的农民，在向文化革命的进军中，同时又向技术革命进军，要为彻底改变落后的生产面貌而斗争。现在结合生产组织和生产基地，全县建立了各式各样的科学技术学习组织。参加这种学习组织的全县已有六万三千多人，其中研究棉花栽培技术的有二万六千七百人，研究土壤的有一万四千二百人，研究畜牧兽医的有二千一百多人，研究农业机械的有二千八百多人。全县七个公社设立了七个科学研究重点，共挑选出一千六百三十人，组成专业生产队（也是学习优秀班），集中劳动，集中学习，培养科学技术的骨干。现在各公社和管理区的脱盲青壮年，在技术革命运动中已经发挥了很大的作用。如孙吉管理区土化肥厂的工人，读了汉语注音的科学技术书籍之后，已经仿制成功了氮、磷、钾混合肥料及其他土化肥十多种。孙吉公社综合加工厂工人王三娃，经过十三天的苦心钻研、仿制成功一种净麦机，一天能净麦一万多斤，比人工净麦提高工效二十五倍。从许许多多的事实中完全可以看出，万荣县文化革命的高潮，已经在促进技术革命高潮的出现，文化革命和技术革命相辅而行，双双跃进，必将把持续的、高速度的生产大跃进推向更新的阶段。
    为了推广万荣县的经验，我们于去年12月在万荣县召开了有各专、市、县的教育行政干部、共青团干部和中、小学校长教师等共六百人参加的现场会议，中央文字改革委员会、全国妇联的负责同志和黑龙江、福建、四川、甘肃、内蒙古等十四个省（区）的代表八十余人也应邀参加。这次会议，有力地推动了全省的扫除文盲和业余教育工作。目前这一工作的进展情况是良好的。据不完全的统计，全省已经训练出拼音教师六万七千六百多人，参加汉语拼音学习的已有三百二十八万多人，其中有二分之一的人已达到会认、会拼、会写的标准。晋南专区农民参加拼音学习的已达一百一十四万人，超过全区青壮年一百一十三万人的总数。自愿参加业余学习的老年人已有八万余人，比未推行汉语拼音之前，增加了四倍。现在，我们已经作出全面规划，力争大大提前实现无盲省。同时，组织了若干学制改革试点，进一步为教学革命创造经验。并着手准备大量编印政治、技术、文艺等注音通俗读物，以便及时供应正在迅速展开的全民性的扫除文盲和业余教育运动的需要。
    以上报告妥否，请指示。
