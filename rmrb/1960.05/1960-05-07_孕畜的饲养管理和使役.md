    Feeding Management and Use of Pregnant Livestock
    Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Scientific and Technical Information Office
    During the busy spring plowing season, while making full use of animal power, attention must be paid to preventing abortion in pregnant livestock. This is a crucial part of ensuring livestock reproduction.
    After conception, the entire body of the female animal undergoes changes to adapt to this new physiological state: appetite increases, metabolism is vigorous, digestive, circulatory, and respiratory functions are strengthened, and sensitivity to changes in various conditions and external stimuli is particularly high. In the early stages of pregnancy, pregnant livestock can adapt to the initial changes in the body and can be rationally fed and managed and participate in labor that does not exceed the daily intensity of ordinary draft animals. In the second half of pregnancy, the size and weight of the fetus have greatly increased, the mother's burden is heavier, more nutrition is required, the temperament becomes relatively calm, the movements are cautious, and it is easy to become tired and sweat. It can no longer bear the same labor as ordinary draft animals. At this time, if the nutritional content of the feed cannot meet the needs of the pregnant livestock, if feeding is improper, management is inadequate, treatment is rough, and the use of labor is unreasonable, it will often affect the mother and fetus, interrupt the pregnancy, and cause abortion.
    The daily feed ration for pregnant livestock should be gradually increased as the pregnancy progresses. Fetal development must obtain nutrition from the mother. The nutrients that pregnant livestock obtain from the daily feed ration must not only maintain their own needs but also fully supply the needs of fetal development. If the feed is insufficient, not only will the pregnant livestock fail to maintain a good physical condition, but the fetus will develop poorly, and dystocia is likely to occur or affect the health of the young livestock. In the first two months of pregnancy, the feed can be the same as other draft animals. The development of the fetus in pregnant livestock begins to accelerate significantly in the middle of pregnancy, around the third month, and the nutrients required by the pregnant livestock increase rapidly. Therefore, the daily ration should be increased from the middle of pregnancy to ensure that the fetus has sufficient nutrition during this important stage of development, develops well, and lays a good foundation for the next stage of development.
    Increasing the daily ration of pregnant livestock does not mean feeding a large amount of feed, but mainly improving the nutritional value of the daily ration. Attention should be paid to the combination of the daily ration to ensure that it is rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals necessary for fetal development. Corn, sorghum, bean cake, bran, and oats are all refined feeds with high nutritional value. Succulent green feed is very rich in nutrients, contains vitamins, and has a good impact on digestion. Fresh grass is the best feed. For pregnant cattle, if the quality of the grass in the pasture is excellent, it can generally meet the required nutrients, but pregnant horses should also be fed some refined feed. Green hay is also nutritious. Alfalfa and other legume hay are rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals. Minerals such as calcium and phosphorus are indispensable in the daily ration. Calcium and phosphorus are the main substances that make up the fetal skeleton. If they are insufficient, they will affect the formation of fetal bones. Table salt can increase the appetite of pregnant livestock, help digestion, and promote metabolism.
    Pregnant livestock should be fed regularly and quantitatively and should not be fed too much at one time. In the second half of pregnancy, the amount of feed should be reduced each time and the number of feedings should be increased. Because the fetus has grown significantly in the second half of pregnancy, if the stomach and intestines are filled with a large amount of feed, it will squeeze the fetus. At the same time, the fetus presses forward on the diaphragm, which already has a certain impact on the activity of the lungs and heart. If the volume of the stomach and intestines increases, the pressure will be even greater, causing obstacles to blood circulation and breathing, leading to abortion. Therefore, when starting to graze or for the first time feeding young green grass and fresh alfalfa, restrictions should be added to avoid overeating due to the change of feed and the palatability of green grass. At the same time, succulent young grass, especially green grass with dew or wetted by rainwater, is prone to fermentation and produces a large amount of gas, which causes the stomach and intestines of pregnant livestock to swell, causing abortion. It is best to give some dry grass before or after feeding to prevent fermentation.
    Pregnant livestock should be watered frequently to avoid excessive thirst and binge drinking. The water should be clean and the water temperature should not be too cold. Do not wash pregnant livestock with cold water, avoid rain, prevent drafts, and do not let pregnant livestock stay in the cold wind for too long. When the temperature changes suddenly, especially after pregnant livestock have labored and sweated, pay more attention to preventing them from catching cold. Cold stimuli can cause colic, diarrhea, and tissue contraction in pregnant livestock, especially drinking large amounts of cold water, which slows the blood flow to internal organs, especially the reproductive organs, causing fetal nutritional disorders and leading to abortion.
    Do not let pregnant livestock go up and down steep slopes or cross ditches and jump to prevent falls. The stables should not be too crowded, the doors and passages should be as wide as possible, males and females should be separated, and pregnant livestock should be fed in separate troughs so that the abdomen of pregnant livestock is not squeezed or kicked and bumped. Falling, abdominal squeezing, or heavy blows such as kicking and bumping often injure the abdomen and cause uterine bleeding in pregnant livestock, or cause severe shocks to the fetus, causing severe fetal movement or even fetal death. These reasons can cause traumatic abortion.
    Strengthening the feeding management of pregnant livestock is an important measure to protect the fetus, and rational use of labor is even more important. Although pregnant livestock can be used in the same way as ordinary draft animals in the early stages of pregnancy, attention must also be paid to protecting pregnant livestock. Because the combination between the placenta and the mother's uterus is not strong in the early stages of pregnancy, it is vulnerable to various adverse factors and detach from the uterine membrane or be damaged, causing abortion. In the second half of pregnancy, the workload of pregnant livestock should be reduced by one-third or one-half. Excessive fatigue of pregnant livestock produces a toxic substance in the blood that can cause fetal death. Do not rush to run when the vehicle is first hitched, do not stop suddenly, do not make sharp turns, and do not drive fast. Heavy labor and fast running can cause pregnant livestock to have difficulty breathing, causing the mother and fetus to lack oxygen and lead to abortion. Pregnant livestock in the second half of pregnancy should preferably not do jobs that involve small circles, such as driving shafts, pushing rollers, grinding mills, and pushing waterwheels. Pregnant livestock should be raised by dedicated personnel, and it is best to have fixed personnel to use them to prevent random grabbing and use.
    Pregnant livestock should stop being used for labor about one month before delivery and should be raised in separate pens or moved to the livestock farm. They should have appropriate exercise every day and get plenty of sunlight. This can prevent the common lower abdominal and hind limb edema in the late stages of pregnancy. Sunlight helps the synthesis of vitamin D in the pregnant livestock's body, which is beneficial to calcium metabolism. During this period, easily digestible feed and warm water should be given. The stables should be clean, dry, well-lit, and have fresh air, and should not be too cold or stuffy. The ground of the stables should be flat and should not be inclined forward or backward. Tilting forward, the fetus presses forward on the diaphragm, affecting heart and lung activity; tilting backward increases the burden on the hindquarters, especially the hind limbs, of pregnant livestock, and hind limb edema is prone to occur.
    As long as the feeding management of pregnant livestock is strengthened, the labor is used rationally, and attention is paid to hygiene and epidemic prevention, abortion of pregnant livestock can be completely avoided.

    孕畜的饲养管理和使役
    中国农业科学院科学情报室
    春耕农忙时节，在充分利用畜力的同时，必须注意防止孕畜流产。这是保证牲畜繁殖的重要一环。
    母畜受胎后，整个机体为适应生理上这种新的状况产生了变化：食欲增进，新陈代谢旺盛，消化、循环和呼吸等机能加强，对各种条件的改变和外界的刺激也格外敏感。怀孕初期，孕畜还不难适应机体内初发生的变化，可与一般役畜同样地合理饲养管理，参加不超过役畜日常强度的劳役。到怀孕后半期，胎儿体积和重量已大大增加，母体负担加重，需要更多的营养，性情变得比较稳静，行动谨慎，容易疲乏、出汗，已不能担负与一般役畜同样的劳役。这时，如果饲料营养不能满足孕畜的需要，饲喂不当，管理不周，对待粗暴，使役不合理，往往都会影响母体和胎儿，使妊娠中断，发生流产。
    孕畜的饲料日粮应随怀孕日期的增加逐渐提高。胎儿发育必须从母体获得营养，孕畜从饲料日粮中得到的营养物质，既要维持本身的需要，又要充分供给胎儿发育的需要。若饲料不足，不但孕畜不能保持良好的体况，而且胎儿发育不良，也易发生难产或影响到幼畜的健壮。孕畜在头两个月内，喂的饲料可与其他役畜相同。孕畜胎儿的发育约在第三个月后的怀孕中期已开始显著加快，孕畜所需的营养物质随之迅速增多。因此，应从怀孕中期开始增加日粮，使胎儿在这一重要发育阶段有足够的营养，发育良好，并为后一阶段的发育打好基础。
    增加孕畜日粮，并不在于喂给大量的饲料，主要是提高日粮的营养价值。日粮应注意配合，要保证富有胎儿发育所必需的蛋白质、维生素和矿物质。玉米、高粱、豆饼、糠麸、燕麦等都是营养价值高的精料。多汁青饲料养分很丰富，含有维生素，并对消化有良好影响。新鲜青草是最好的饲料，对孕牛来说，如放牧地的青草质量俱佳，一般能满足所需的营养物质，但孕马还要喂些精料。青干草营养亦佳，如苜蓿等豆科干草富含蛋白质、维生素和矿物质。日粮中钙、磷等矿物质不可缺，钙、磷是构成胎儿骨胳的主要物质，如不足，即影响胎儿骨的形成。食盐能使孕畜食欲增进，有助消化和促进新陈代谢的作用。
    孕畜饲喂要定时定量，不宜一次喂得过多。怀孕后半期应减少每次饲料量，增加饲喂次数。因为怀孕后半期胎儿已显著增大，如肠胃充满大量饲料，就会挤压胎儿；同时，胎儿向前压迫横隔膜，原已对肺脏、心脏的活动有一定影响，再加上肠胃体积增大，则压迫更重，造成血液循环和呼吸的障碍，而导致流产。因此在开始放青或初次喂幼嫩青草和鲜苜蓿等时，要加限制，以免因刚换饲料，青草味又可口，孕畜贪吃过食。同时，多汁嫩草，特别是沾有露水或被雨水淋湿的青草，容易发酵产生大量气体，使孕畜肠胃膨气，引起流产。最好在喂前或饲后给些干草，可防止发酵。
    孕畜喂水要勤，不使过渴和暴饮。水要清洁，水温不宜过冷。不用冷水冲洗孕畜，避免雨淋，防止贼风，不让孕畜在冷风中逗留过久；气温骤变时，特别是孕畜劳役出汗后，更应注意不使受寒。孕畜受冷的刺激会引起疝痛、腹泻、组织收缩，特别是饮大量冷水，使内脏器官尤其是生殖器官血流缓慢，造成胎儿营养障碍，而致流产。
    不让孕畜上下陡坡或跨沟、跳跃，以防跌倒。厩舍不宜过于拥挤，门及通道力求宽阔，公母分舍，孕畜分槽饲养，使孕畜不致腹部受挤压或遭蹴踢、顶撞。摔倒、腹部受挤压或遭蹴踢、顶撞等重力打击，常使孕畜腹部受伤和子宫出血，或使胎儿受到剧烈震荡，轻则引起强烈胎动，重则胎儿死亡。这些原因都会引起创伤性流产。
    加强孕畜的饲养管理是保胎的重要措施，合理使役更为重要。孕畜在怀孕前期虽可与一般役畜同样使役，但也必须注意对孕畜的保护。因怀孕初期胎盘与母体子宫之间的结合还不牢固，易受各种不利因素的作用而脱离子宫膜或受损坏，引起流产。到怀孕后半期，应减轻孕畜三分之一或一半工作量。孕畜疲劳过度，血液中产生一种有毒物质，能使胎儿死亡。刚套车上道不要急跑赶路，不猛停车，不急转弯，不驱赶快跑。重役、快跑都会使孕畜呼吸困难，造成母畜和胎儿缺氧而招致流产。怀孕后半期的孕畜最好不干驾辕、推碾子、推磨和推水车等转小圈的活。孕畜要有专人饲养，最好固定人使役，防止乱抓乱用。
    孕畜到临产前一个月左右应停止使役，单栏饲养或移到畜产院饲养。每天有适当的运动，多晒太阳。这样可以防止怀孕后期常见的下腹和后肢浮肿现象；日光有助孕畜机体丁种维生素的合成，有利于钙的代谢。这一期间应喂给易消化的饲料和温水。厩舍要清洁干燥、光线充足、空气新鲜，又不宜过冷或闷热。厩床地面要平坦，不宜前后倾斜。向前倾，胎儿向前压迫横隔膜，影响心肺活动；往后斜，则增加孕畜后躯，特别是后肢的负重，易发生后肢浮肿。
    只要加强孕畜的饲养管理，合理使役，注意卫生防疫，孕畜流产是完全可以避免的。
