Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: Premier Zhou Enlai today severely condemned the US imperialist aggression and provocative crimes against the Soviet Union, and condemned the US government's blatant sabotage of the summit conference of great powers. He stated, "The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely support the series of stern measures taken recently by the Soviet government against the provocative crimes of US imperialism."

Premier Zhou solemnly warned the US government: "It is not going to work to treat us with an imperialist attitude. Do not regard the peaceful efforts of socialist countries as a sign of weakness. An infringement upon any socialist country is an infringement upon China, is an infringement upon the entire socialist camp, and must be met with a devastating counterattack."

Premier Zhou Enlai made these remarks at a banquet tonight in honor of the delegation from the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, headed by Belkacem. Premier Zhou said, "US imperialism is the number one enemy of world peace. Recently, the US government dispatched spy planes to invade Soviet territory and openly claimed that conducting aggressive spy flights is the established policy of the US government. Not only that, the US government brazenly disregarded the Soviet government's solemn protests and reasonable demands, refused to take responsibility for its crimes, and refused to make the necessary guarantees not to repeat them, making the summit conference of great powers, which the world yearned for, impossible to hold. This thoroughly exposed the barbarous face of US imperialism."

He said, "The United States' agreement to hold a summit conference of great powers was extremely reluctant in the first place. While feigning peace, it has never stopped its frenzied arms expansion and war preparations, it has created various difficulties and obstacles for the summit conference of great powers, and it has continuously spread the pessimistic atmosphere that the summit conference of great powers is doomed to failure. The fact that the summit conference of great powers was finally destroyed by the United States is by no means accidental."

Premier Zhou Enlai said, "Now, the United States is actually attempting to shift the responsibility for destroying the summit conference of great powers onto the Soviet Union, which is truly shameless in the extreme."

Premier Zhou said that the solemn statement made by Comrade Khrushchev on behalf of the Soviet government "is the voice of the great Soviet people and also represents the position of the entire socialist camp."

He emphasized, "The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely support the series of stern measures taken recently by the Soviet government against the provocative crimes of US imperialism."

"The 650 million Chinese people will continue to unite closely with the great Soviet people, with the people of all socialist countries, and with all peace-loving people in the world, and will unremittingly strive to ease international tensions and win lasting world peace."

Premier Zhou Enlai's righteous and powerful statements aroused prolonged and enthusiastic applause at the banquet.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: Premier Zhou Enlai held a banquet tonight to bid farewell to Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Krim Belkacem and all the distinguished guests of the delegation from the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria led by him.

Present at the banquet tonight were Vice Premier of the State Council Marshal He Long, Vice Premier of the State Council and Foreign Minister Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Luo Ruiqing, Vice Premier of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru and Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Fu Zuoyi, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Luo Guibo, and Ji Pengfei, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity Liao Chengzhi, Vice Presidents of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association Nan Hanchen, Liu Zizai, Zhang Tiesheng, and others.

Premier Zhou first spoke at the banquet. (For the full text of the speech, see page two.) He asked the distinguished guests to tell the broad masses of the Algerian people that the 650 million Chinese people will always stand on the side of the heroic Algerian people who are opposing imperialism and striving for national independence.

Vice Premier Krim Belkacem spoke amid warm applause. (For the full text of the speech, see page three.) He said that the Algerian people cherish the assistance of the Chinese people, which proves that the Algerian people's struggle for liberation is not isolated.

Vice Premier Krim Belkacem finally enthusiastically shouted: Long live the great and glorious Chinese people! Long live our unity and friendship!

The speeches of Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Krim Belkacem aroused bursts of warm applause throughout the hall.

    在招待阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团的宴会上
    周总理谴责美国侵略苏联和破坏四国会议
    坚决支持苏联反对美国侵略的严正措施
    中国人民将继续同苏联人民紧紧团结在一起，为争取世界持久和平而努力
    正告美国政府：对任何一个社会主义国家的侵犯都一定要遭到毁灭性还击
    新华社19日讯　周恩来总理今天严厉谴责美帝国主义对苏联的侵略和挑衅罪行，谴责美国政府悍然破坏大国首脑会议。他声明，“中国政府和中国人民坚决支持苏联政府最近对美国帝国主义的挑衅罪行所采取的一系列的严正措施”。
    周总理正告美国政府说：“用帝国主义的态度对待我们是不行的，不要把社会主义国家的和平努力看成是软弱的表现；对任何一个社会主义国家的侵犯，就是对中国的侵犯，就是对整个社会主义阵营的侵犯，都一定要遭到毁灭性的还击”。
    周恩来总理是在今晚招待以贝勒卡塞姆为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团的宴会上讲这些话的。周总理说，“美国帝国主义是世界和平的头号敌人。最近，美国政府派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联国境，并且公然声称进行侵略性的间谍飞行是美国政府的既定政策。不仅如此，美国政府悍然不顾苏联政府的严正抗议和合理要求，拒绝对自己的罪行承担责任，拒绝作出不再重犯的应有保证，使举世渴望的大国首脑会议无法举行。这就彻底揭露了美国帝国主义的蛮横面目”。
    他说，“美国同意举行大国首脑会议本来就是极其勉强的。在它伪装和平的同时，它从来没有停止疯狂的扩军备战活动，它为大国首脑会议制造了种种困难和障碍，并且不断地散布大国首脑会议注定失败的悲观空气，大国首脑会议终于被美国所破坏，决不是偶然的”。
    周恩来总理说，“现在，美国竟企图把破坏大国首脑会议的责任转嫁到苏联身上，这真是无耻到了极点”。
    周总理说，赫鲁晓夫同志代表苏联政府所作的严正声明，“是伟大的苏联人民的声音，也代表了整个社会主义阵营的立场”。
    他强调说，“中国政府和中国人民坚决支持苏联政府最近对美国帝国主义的挑衅罪行所采取的一系列的严正措施”。
    “六亿五千万中国人民将继续同伟大的苏联人民，同所有社会主义国家的人民，同全世界一切爱好和平的人民，紧紧地团结在一起，坚持不懈地为和缓国际紧张局势、争取世界持久和平而努力。”
    周恩来总理的这些义正词严坚强有力的声明，在宴会上激起了长时间的热烈的掌声。
    据新华社19日讯　周恩来总理今晚举行宴会，欢送克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理兼外交部长和由他率领的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团的全体贵宾。
    出席今晚宴会的，有国务院副总理贺龙元帅，国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅元帅，国务院副总理、中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿大将，国务院副总理习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒、郭沫若，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，国防委员会副主席傅作义，外交部副部长章汉夫、罗贵波、姬鹏飞，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志，中国非洲人民友好协会副会长南汉宸、刘子载、张铁生等。
    周总理在宴会上首先讲话。（讲话全文见第二版）他请贵宾们告诉广大的阿尔及利亚人民，六亿五千万中国人民将永远站在反对帝国主义、争取民族独立的英雄的阿尔及利亚人民这一边。
    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理在热烈的掌声中讲话。（讲话全文见第三版）。他说，阿尔及利亚人民珍视中国人民的援助，这种援助证明阿尔及利亚人民争取解放的斗争并不是孤立的。
    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理最后热情高呼：伟大的光荣的中国人民万岁！我们的团结和友谊万岁。
    周总理和克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理的讲话，激起全场一阵又一阵的热烈掌声。
    出席宴会作陪的，还有政府各部门、各民主党派、各人民团体和北京市的负责人，中国人民解放军高级将领和首都各方面的人士。
