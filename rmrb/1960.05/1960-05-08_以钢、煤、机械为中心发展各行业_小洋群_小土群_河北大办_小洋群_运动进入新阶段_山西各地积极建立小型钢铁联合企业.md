Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 7th. The mass movement in Hebei Province to vigorously develop "Small Native Groups" and "Small Foreign Groups" industries has entered a new stage. Due to the rapid development of "Small Foreign Groups" in raw material industries such as steel and coal, it has driven a comprehensive leap forward in various industries. The "Small Native Groups" and "Small Foreign Groups" industrial production system is gradually taking shape.

The "Small Native Groups" and "Small Foreign Groups" industries in Hebei Province were developed from "starting from scratch" during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Up to now, 9,216 "Small Native Groups" and "Small Foreign Groups" factories and mines have been built in the province. These include steel, coal, and machinery industries, as well as light and chemical industries. These small enterprises, with their strong vitality, are playing a huge role in the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production in the province. Since the beginning of this year, the output value of "Small Native Groups" and "Small Foreign Groups" industries has accounted for 57.9% of the province's total industrial output value. Not only has there been great development in steel and coal, but also products such as lead, aluminum, petroleum, ammonium sulfate, and sugar, which were never produced before, are now produced by "Small Native Groups" and "Small Foreign Groups" industries. Many "Small Foreign Groups" and "Small Native Groups" industries have not only caught up with and surpassed the levels of large foreign enterprises in terms of technical and economic indicators, but have also created many new technologies and processes, vigorously promoting the in-depth development of the technical revolution movement.

On the basis of high-speed development, and according to resource conditions, complete sets are formed. Some regions have developed from individual small factories and mines towards "Small Foreign Joint Ventures" centered on steel, coal, and machinery manufacturing, and have begun to form small industrial production systems suitable for their own economic development needs. This is a clear feature of the current development of the "Small Native Groups" and "Small Foreign Groups" movement in Hebei Province. Ding County in Baoding Prefecture used to build small-scale industries such as machinery manufacturing, repair, and parts, but due to the weakness of the raw material industry, it affected the continuous leap forward of the entire production. Later, the county vigorously grasped the construction of raw material enterprises, repaired two small blast furnaces, and built small coal mines, small converters, small electric furnaces, rolling mills, coking, and other raw material production enterprises, so that the county's annual iron production capacity reached 15,000 tons, steel reached 10,000 tons, steel 8,000 tons, and coal 300,000 tons. At the same time, it is also building small factories for electrolytic aluminum, wire drawing, high-voltage electromagnetics, and cement poles. This has formed an industrial production system in the county from the production of raw materials such as steel and coal to the processing of machinery manufacturing and agricultural and sideline products. The establishment of "Small Foreign Groups" and "Small Native Groups" industrial production systems in many regions has not only eliminated the blank spots in the original industrial production, making the "Small Foreign Groups" and "Small Native Groups" industries develop rapidly, but also facilitated local material extraction and local production, greatly shortening transportation distances, saving manpower and material resources, and reducing production costs.

Vigorously engaging in diversified operations and comprehensive utilization, and gradually developing from the production of single products to a variety of products, is another clear feature of the mass movement of "Small Foreign Groups" and "Small Native Groups" industries in Hebei Province. Now, "Small Foreign Groups" employees in many industries are studying and transforming production technology, vigorously engaging in comprehensive utilization of coal, wild plants, and agricultural and sideline products, and striving to produce more products with a small amount of raw materials. At present, nearly 300 small coking plants in the province have installed recovery equipment, achieving "coking must collect oil." Since April, the average daily output of coal tar has increased by more than two times compared with the first quarter. Yuanshi Coking Plant has produced 27 kinds of by-products from recovered coal tar, such as ammonium sulfate, synthetic ammonia, light and medium diesel, and refined naphthalene, reducing the cost of coke by 63.15%.

At present, the "Small Native Groups" and "Small Foreign Groups" movement in Hebei Province is advancing in a more organized, more extensive, and more in-depth manner. From the province to the city, from the county to the commune, "Small Foreign Groups" offices and headquarters have been established. The secretaries personally take charge, widely mobilizing the masses, and mobilizing workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers. They adopt the method of old factories leading new factories, new factories promoting old factories, mutual promotion, and mutual support, planning while acting, building while producing, and comprehensively developing. There are more than 1,400 "Small Foreign Groups" and "Small Native Groups" enterprises under construction in the province.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th. A mass movement is underway in various parts of Shanxi Province to vigorously develop "Small Foreign Joint Ventures" (i.e., small foreign group iron and steel joint enterprises) in the iron and steel industry, vigorously build small converters, and vigorously build native rolling mills. According to the plans of various regions, the province will basically achieve the goal of every county having iron and steel "Small Foreign Joint Ventures" this year.

At present, most areas in the province have entered the construction stage while formulating plans. In Taiyuan, Changzhi, and southern, northern, and southeastern Shanxi, which have made faster progress, 47 small converters and five sets of small native rolling mills of 44 iron and steel "Small Foreign Joint Ventures" such as Nanzhai in Jincheng County and Yingchao in Yangcheng County have been put into production.

The iron and steel "Small Foreign Joint Ventures" planned for development in various regions generally have the following forms: Most are equipped with small blast furnaces and small converters; half of the "Small Foreign Joint Ventures" will have a "one-stop" operation of small blast furnaces, small converters, and native rolling mills; a very small number of units will have small blast furnaces and rolling mills, or converters and rolling mills. The province plans to complete this year's plan in three campaigns. The first campaign conducted around the "May Day" holiday has basically ended.

In order to strengthen the leadership of this movement, the Party committees in various regions have established iron and steel "Small Foreign Joint Ventures" offices with the secretaries in charge. The Shanxi Provincial Metallurgical Department recently summarized the experience of the "stepped converter" created by the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant in 1958, and finalized it for promotion. This type of converter is installed below the iron outlet of the iron melting furnace. After the molten iron is melted, it can automatically flow into the converter for blowing without passing through the molten iron package; after the steel is made, it flows into the ingot mold placed under the converter for automatic casting. This can save hoisting equipment, save funds, shorten the construction period, and ensure that new equipment can be quickly put into production.

While developing small converters and native rolling mills, various regions are also vigorously grasping small-scale mining, small-scale native coking, small-scale native railways, and native methods of producing refractory materials to meet the needs of large-scale iron and steel production. In terms of small native railways alone, there are currently 24 lines with a total length of 135 kilometers in the province that have been opened to traffic.

    以钢、煤、机械为中心发展各行业“小洋群”“小土群”
    河北大办“小洋群”运动进入新阶段
    山西各地积极建立小型钢铁联合企业
    据新华社天津7日电　河北省大办“小土群”、“小洋群”工业的群众运动，已经跨进了一个新阶段。由于钢铁、煤炭等原料工业“小洋群”的飞速发展，带动了各行各业全面跃进，“小土群”、“小洋群”工业生产体系正在逐步形成中。
    河北省“小土群”、“小洋群”工业是在1958年大跃进中“白手起家”发展起来的。到目前为止，全省已经建起“小土群”、“小洋群”厂矿企业九千二百一十六个。其中有钢铁、煤炭、机器工业，也有轻工业和化学工业。这些小型企业以旺盛的生命力，在全省工农业生产的高速度发展过程中起着巨大作用。今年以来，全省工业总产值中“小土群”、“小洋群”工业产值就占57.9％。不但钢铁煤炭有了极大发展，就是从来没有生产过的铅、铝、石油、硫酸铵和食糖等产品，现在也都由“小土群”、“小洋群”工业生产出来。许多“小洋群”“小土群”工业，不仅在技术经济指标上赶上和超过大洋企业的水平，而且还创造了不少新技术、新工艺，有力地推动了技术革命运动的深入开展。
    在高速度发展的基础上，根据资源条件，成龙配套，有的地区已由单个的小工厂、矿山向着以钢铁、煤炭、机械制造为中心的“小洋联”方向发展，并且开始形成适合自己经济发展需要的小型工业生产体系，这是当前河北省“小土群”“小洋群”运动发展中的一个鲜明特点。保定专区定县过去建起了机械制造、修配等小型工业，但是由于原料材料工业薄弱，影响整个生产持续跃进。后来这个县大抓原料材料企业的建设，修复两座小高炉，新建了小煤矿、小转炉、小电炉、轧钢机、炼焦等原料材料生产企业，使全县铁的年生产能力达到一万五千吨，钢达到一万吨、钢材八千吨、煤炭三十万吨，同时还在建设电解铝、拔丝、高压电磁、水泥电线杆等小型工厂。这样就使这个县形成了从钢铁、煤炭等原材料生产到机器制造、农副产品加工的工业生产体系。许多地区“小洋群”“小土群”工业生产体系的建立，不仅消灭了原来工业生产上的空白点，使“小洋群”、“小土群”工业得到了飞速发展，而且便于就地取材、就地生产，大大缩短了运输距离，节约了人力、物力、降低了生产成本。
    大搞多种经营和综合利用，由生产单一产品逐渐向多种产品发展，这是河北省“小洋群”“小土群”工业群众运动的另一个鲜明特点。现在，许多行业的“小洋群”职工都在研究改造生产技术，大搞煤炭、野生植物和农副产品等方面综合利用，努力争取用少量的原料生产更多的产品。目前，全省已有将近三百多座小型炼焦厂安装上了回收设备，作到了“炼焦必收油”。4月份以来，焦油的平均日产量比第一季度提高了两倍多。元氏炼焦厂已从回收的焦油中生产出硫酸铵、合成铵和轻、中柴油、净萘等副产品达二十七种，使焦炭成本降低了63.15％。
    目前，河北省“小土群”、“小洋群”运动，正更有组织、更加广泛、更为深入地向前推进。从省到市从县到社都建立了“小洋群”办公室和指挥部，书记亲自挂帅，广泛发动群众，工农商学兵齐动员，采取旧厂带新厂，新厂促旧厂，互相促进，互相支援办法，边规划、边行动、边建设、边生产，全面大发展。全省正在施工建设的“小洋群”“小土群”企业有一千四百多个。
    据新华社太原7日电　山西省各地正在开展一个行行业业大搞钢铁“小洋联”（即小洋群钢铁联合企业）的群众运动，大办小转炉，大办土轧钢机。按照各地的规划，全省将在今年内基本上实现县县都有钢铁“小洋联”。
    现在，全省大部分地区在制订规划的同时，都已进入了施工阶段。进展较快的太原、长治两个市和晋南、晋北、晋东南等地，已有晋城县南寨、阳城县应朝等四十四个钢铁“小洋联”的四十七个小转炉和五套小土轧钢机先后投入了生产。
    各地规划发展的钢铁“小洋联”，一般有这样几种形式：绝大部分是小高炉和小转炉配套；有半数的“小洋联”，将拥有小高炉、小转炉和土轧钢机“一条龙”；极少数的单位将有小高炉和轧钢机，或是有转炉和轧钢机。全省计划分三个战役来完成今年的规划，“五一”节前后进行的第一个战役已经基本结束。
    为了加强对这个运动的领导，各地党委都以书记挂帅成立了钢铁“小洋联”办公室。山西省冶金厅最近还总结了1958年长治钢铁厂创造的“阶梯式转炉”的经验，定型推广。这种转炉是安装在化铁炉出铁口的下边，铁水熔化后不需经过铁水包就可自动流入转炉吹炼；炼成钢后，又流入置放在转炉下的铸锭模中，自动浇铸。这样就可省出吊装设备，节省了资金，缩短了工期，保证新增设备能够迅速投入生产。
    在发展小转炉、土轧机的同时，各地还相应地大抓小型采矿、小土炼焦、小土铁路和土法生产耐火材料等，以适应大炼钢铁的需要。仅小土铁路，目前全省就已有二十四条一百三十五公里通车。
