Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th—Our correspondent reports: Since the beginning of May, South Korean youth and students, standing at the forefront of the struggle against the fascist rule of the US-Syngman Rhee clique, have launched a struggle against the American colonial slave education system and to expel US-Syngman Rhee secret agents and puppet faculty members from schools. This struggle has gradually expanded from large cities such as Seoul, Busan, and Daegu to all parts of South Korea, and the scale of the struggle is growing.

Today, two thousand students from Sookmyung Women's University in Seoul began a sit-in demonstration on the playground at 10:00 a.m. They shouted angrily, "Principal, get out!" and "Puppet professors, get out!"

Currently, most of the principals of South Korean schools are US-Syngman Rhee secret agents. They usually engage in malfeasance and embezzle students' money, giving students no democracy or freedom. During the South Korean puppet "presidential election" on March 15th this year, they even more blatantly used students as political tools, forcing students to vote for Syngman Rhee and Lee Ki-poong. Some school principals and supervisors also obstructed students from participating in demonstrations against the fascist rule of the US-Syngman Rhee clique. Some school principals even openly accepted bribes, allowing many children of bureaucrats of the Syngman Rhee group to enter schools illegally.

Therefore, the broad masses of South Korean youth and students have become extremely hateful of the US-Syngman Rhee secret agent principals and puppet elements. With the deepening development of the South Korean people's struggle to demand the complete abolition of the Syngman Rhee fascist ruling institutions, students from various universities and middle schools in Seoul, Busan, Daegu and other places have successively gone on strike and demonstrated, launching a struggle within the schools to expel US-Syngman Rhee secret agents and strive for democracy and freedom. Immediately afterwards, students in middle and small cities in South Jeolla Province, South Gyeongsang Province, and North Chungcheong Province also extensively launched this struggle. By May 10th, just at Hanyang University in Seoul and Kyungpook National University in Daegu, eight thousand students had gone on strike, expelling the secret agent principals and "puppet professors" from these schools. When four thousand students from Kyungpook National University went on strike on the 10th, they put forward eight demands for "puppet professors" Mr. Li and Mr. Quan to get out of the school. They announced that they would continue the strike until the goal was achieved. On the 9th, the students of this university also held a "withdrawal ceremony," reading a declaration that they would never listen to the lectures of these puppet elements, and then all walked out of the school gate.

In this fierce struggle, students from Busan Girls' Middle School have expelled the principal who participated in the "March 15th" puppet "presidential election" from the school. Students from Mokpo High School began a tenacious struggle on May 5th to overthrow "puppet teachers who take promotion and wealth as their main business," and have already forced four secret agent faculty members, including the school's "head of the administrative section," to get out of the school. On May 9th, students from Jangheung Middle School in Jangheung County, South Jeolla Province, who held a demonstration to expel the secret agent principal, broke into the home of the school principal and destroyed all the furniture and equipment in the secret agent principal's home.

### 粉碎法西斯统治　反对殖民奴化教育  南朝鲜各地学生奋起驱逐美李特务分子

    粉碎法西斯统治　反对殖民奴化教育
    南朝鲜各地学生奋起驱逐美李特务分子
    新华社平壤11日电　本社记者报道：进入5月以来，站在反对美李集团法西斯统治斗争前列的南朝鲜青年学生，掀起了反对美国殖民奴役教育制度、驱逐美李特务和御用教职员出校的斗争已由汉城、釜山、大丘等大城市逐渐扩大到南朝鲜各地，斗争规模越来越大。
      今天，汉城的淑明女子大学学生二千人从上午十时开始在操场上举行静坐示威。他们愤怒地高呼着“校长滚出去”、“御用教授滚出去”的口号。
    目前南朝鲜各学校的校长大部分是美李特务分子。他们平时营私舞弊，搜刮学生们的金钱，不给学生一点民主和自由。今年3月15日，南朝鲜伪“总统选举”时，他们更露骨地把学生当作政治工具，强迫学生们投李承晚和李起鹏的票。一些学校的校长和校监还阻挠学生们参加反对美李集团法西斯统治的示威。有的学校的校长还公然接受贿赂，使李承晚集团的许多官僚子弟非法入校。
    因此，南朝鲜广大青年学生对美李特务校长和御用分子已憎恨到极点。随着南朝鲜人民要求全面废除李承晚法西斯统治机构的斗争的深入开展，汉城、釜山、大丘等地的各个大学和中学的学生纷纷罢课、示威，在校内展开了驱逐美李特务分子、争取民主和自由的斗争。紧接着，全罗南道、庆尚南道、忠清北道等地的中、小城市的学生也广泛展开这一斗争。到5月10日，仅汉城的汉阳大学和大丘的庆北大学就有八千名学生举行罢课，驱逐这些学校中的特务校长和“御用教授”们出校。庆北大学的四千名学生10日举行罢课时曾提出要“御用教授”李某和全某等滚出学校的八项要求。他们宣布，不达到目的就要继续罢课。这个大学的学生在9日还举行了“退学式”，朗读了决不听这些御用分子们授课的宣言，随后都走出了校门。
    在这场激烈的斗争中釜山女中的学生们已把参加“三·一五”伪“总统选举”的校长逐出了学校。木浦高等学校的学生们从5月5日开始为打倒“以升官发财为本业的”御用教员而展开了顽强的斗争，已经迫使这个学校的“事务科长”等四个特务教职员滚出了学校。5月9日为驱逐特务校长举行示威斗争的全罗南道长兴郡长兴中学的学生们，曾经打进该学校校长的家中，把特务校长家中的家具设备全部捣毁。
