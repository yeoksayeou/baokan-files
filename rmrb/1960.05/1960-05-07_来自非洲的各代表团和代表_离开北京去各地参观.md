Xinhua News Agency, 6th – Friends from Africa on the front lines of the anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist struggle, after carrying out extensive visits and activities in Beijing, left Beijing last night one after another to visit various places.

Around the "May Day" International Labor Day, these African friends visited factories, urban and rural people's communes, schools, and hospitals in Beijing, and were warmly welcomed by the people of the capital. The delegation of the National Confederation of Workers of the Congo visited the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory and other units, where they were welcomed everywhere, and they were very excited. The head of the delegation, Edouard Valentin Moudonbé, said, "Coming to China is like coming to my own home. Everywhere we feel that the Chinese people's support and friendship for the African people is sincere." A trade union representative from Cameroon said after visiting the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, "The current Cameroon is like China in the past, with resources plundered by imperialism. After Cameroon is truly independent, it will also learn from China and build more factories." The Zanzibar Federation of Labour delegation, led by Moyo Hassam Nassor, General Secretary of the Pemba Labour Union, visited the Beijing Timber Factory. When they saw the results of the workers' vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution, they could not help but applaud in praise. Moyo Hassam Nassor, the head of the delegation who was a carpenter by training, said that under imperialist rule in Zanzibar, workers are enslaved and their wisdom cannot be brought into play. After this visit back home, he will definitely convey the achievements of the liberated Chinese people to more people. The vice-chairman of the Beijing Timber Factory Trade Union, who accompanied them on the visit, told the delegation that we firmly support the African people's struggle for national independence.

The Algerian Youth Delegation visited the Lugouqiao People's Commune. After visiting the production team, middle school and automobile repair shop of the People's Commune, the delegates said: "The People's Commune is very good, and the slanders of the imperialists against the People's Commune are unfounded."

The Moroccan Trade Union Delegation and Abdou Rahman Zama Hassan, representative of the Somaliland African Independent Trade Union Federation, visited the Beijing Petroleum Institute. El Alaoui M’Laye Lyazid, head of the Moroccan Trade Union Delegation, saw that the students were doing internships in the laboratory and machine factory, and he expressed his belief that this educational method can cultivate healthy, knowledgeable, and capable talents.

In recent days, the delegations have also visited buildings and toured scenic spots and historical sites in Beijing. The delegation of the National Confederation of Workers of the Congo, the delegation of the General Union of Algerian Workers, and the delegation of the General Confederation of Labour of Cameroon visited the Ming Tombs Reservoir, the Dingling Underground Palace and the Badaling Great Wall. Falès Ben Mehal, head of the delegation of the General Union of Algerian Workers, said after listening to the introduction of the project by the staff of the Ming Tombs Reservoir Management Office: "Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the wisdom and strength of the Chinese people have been fully utilized."

    来自非洲的各代表团和代表
    离开北京去各地参观
    新华社6日讯　来自反帝国主义、反殖民主义斗争前线的非洲朋友们，在北京进行了广泛的参观访问活动以后，昨晚陆续离开北京前往各地参观访问。
    这些非洲朋友在“五一”国际劳动节前后，在北京参观访问了工厂、城乡人民公社、学校和医院，受到首都人民热烈的欢迎。刚果全国工人联合会代表团参观了北京第一机床厂等单位，到处受到欢迎，他们非常兴奋。代表团团长爱德华·瓦朗丁·穆东伯说：“到中国就好像是到了自己的家里。我们处处都感到，中国人民对非洲人民的支持和友情是真诚的。”喀麦隆的一位工会代表在参观北京第二棉纺织厂以后说：“现在的喀麦隆和过去的中国一样，资源都被帝国主义掠夺去了。喀麦隆真正独立以后，也要学习中国，多多建设工厂。”以奔巴劳工联合会总书记摩郁·哈萨姆·纳索为首的桑给巴尔劳工联合会代表团，参观了北京市木材厂。当他们看到工人们大搞技术革新和技术革命的成果时，都情不自禁地鼓掌表示称赞。木工出身的代表团团长摩郁·哈萨姆·纳索说，桑给巴尔在帝国主义统治下，工人是被奴役的，他们的智慧得不到发挥。这次参观回国以后，一定把解放了的中国人民所取得的成就，转告给更多的人。陪同他们参观的北京市木材厂工会副主席向代表团表示，我们坚决支持非洲人民为争取民族独立而进行的斗争。
    阿尔及利亚青年代表团参观了芦沟桥人民公社。代表们在访问了人民公社的生产队、中学和汽车修配厂以后说：“人民公社好得很，帝国主义对人民公社的污蔑是毫无根据的。”
    摩洛哥工会代表团和索马里兰非洲人独立工会联合会代表阿卜杜·拉曼·扎玛·哈森参观了北京石油学院。摩洛哥工会代表团团长埃拉路易·穆拉依·利亚吉德，看到学生们正在实验室和机械厂进行实习的情况，他表示相信这种教育方法能培养出心身健康、有知识有能力的人材。
    连日来，各代表团还参观了北京的建筑物和游览了名胜古迹。刚果全国工人联合会代表团、阿尔及利亚工人总联合会代表团、喀麦隆劳工总联合会代表团等参观游览了十三陵水库、定陵地下博物馆和八达岭。阿尔及利亚工人总联合会代表团团长法莱斯·本·梅哈尔，听了十三陵水库管理处工作人员关于工程情况的介绍以后说：“在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，中国人民的智慧和力量得到了充分的发挥。”
