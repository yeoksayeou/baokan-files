Editorial

    The long-awaited Four-Power Summit has been wrecked by the U.S. government before it even formally began! This is not surprising to those who examine the international situation from the viewpoint of class analysis, rather than being misled by certain superficial phenomena, and to those who recognize the essence of imperialism. This is the result of the U.S. government's long-standing policy of aggression and war. U.S. President Eisenhower, with the support of British Prime Minister Macmillan and French President de Gaulle, insisted on pursuing a blatant policy of aggression and war against the Soviet Union and socialist countries, and rejected the basic conditions put forward by Comrade Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, for holding the summit on an equal footing, thereby burying the summit. In this way, American imperialism has nakedly exposed its ferocious face to the people of the world as an enemy of the world's people and an enemy of world peace. The further exposure of the nature and ferocity of American imperialism is a good thing for the cause of world peace and human progress. The people of the world will surely draw beneficial lessons from this event, raise their awareness, more clearly recognize the true face of American imperialism, and unite more closely to smash the aggressive and war policies of the U.S.-led imperialist camp, and wage unremitting struggle to defend world peace.
    As everyone knows, at the preliminary meeting of the Four-Power Summit on May 16, Comrade Khrushchev issued a statement sternly condemning the provocative actions of U.S. military aircraft that recently violated Soviet airspace and the U.S. government's insistence on a provocative policy towards the Soviet Union, pointing out that this fully demonstrated that the United States had no sincerity in reaching an agreement and made it impossible to conduct fruitful negotiations at the Four-Power Summit. Comrade Khrushchev demanded that the U.S. government condemn the provocative actions against the Soviet Union, announce that it would no longer take such actions and pursue such policies against the Soviet Union in the future, and severely punish the criminals directly involved in this incident. This attitude taken by the Soviet Union is entirely just, expresses the strong will of the Soviet people and the people of socialist countries, and is also entirely in line with the interests of world peace. As everyone knows, on the eve of the Four-Power Summit, the United States sent military aircraft to intrude into Soviet territory to carry out provocations. When this act of aggression was exposed, Eisenhower and his government not only showed no remorse, but openly declared that this act of infringing upon Soviet sovereignty was a national policy of the United States, and stated that they would continue to carry out such provocative activities against the Soviet Union. Faced with this arrogant and blatant aggressor attitude of the United States, no country with national self-esteem could swallow its anger, and no country that truly cares about world peace could fail to condemn it severely. The people of the Soviet Union have continued to hold protest rallies in various places in recent days, fully expressing the unparalleled indignation of the Soviet people. The Chinese people fully support the solemn position adhered to by Comrade Khrushchev in his statement. The Chinese people stand entirely with the Soviet people and resolutely oppose American imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit and resolutely oppose American imperialism's aggression and provocations against the Soviet Union.
    The Chinese people, like the people of all socialist countries, had hoped that the Four-Power Summit could achieve success and firmly supported the Soviet Union's efforts to promote the relaxation of international tensions. However, under the current circumstances, as Comrade Khrushchev said, the Soviet Union "cannot be among the participants in negotiations, one of whom bases his policy towards the Soviet Union on perfidy. If the Soviet government were to participate in negotiations that are obviously doomed to failure under the current circumstances, it would become an accomplice in deceiving the people of all countries, but it does not want to become such an accomplice." Comrade Khrushchev said: "There is no better way than to postpone the summit by about six to eight months." This proposition of the Soviet government has undoubtedly won the full approval of the Chinese people, the people of socialist countries, and all truly peace-loving people in the world.
    After being sternly condemned by Comrade Khrushchev, Eisenhower issued a statement denying that he had threatened to continue to violate Soviet territory, claiming that the flights violating Soviet airspace "have been suspended and will not be resumed"; however, he still insisted that this aggressive activity of the United States that undermines the sovereignty of other countries is a "necessary measure" "to safeguard the security of the United States and the free world." Moreover, he also said that the period during which such flights will not be resumed is limited to his term as president. In this way, Eisenhower once again revealed his rogue face, completely lost the universally recognized minimum moral standards, and completely undermined the basic principles of international law regarding respect for national sovereignty. This is like a robber who, after being caught, while having to promise to stop stealing for the time being, insists that stealing is justified and can still be done after a period of time. Under such circumstances, how could the Soviet Union, as a sovereign state, tolerate such humiliation? How can the head of a government that declares invading the Soviet Union as a national policy sit down to talk? Comrade Khrushchev said in a statement at a press conference on the 18th: "We cannot tolerate insults, we have pride, we have our own dignity, we represent powerful socialist countries." Similarly, since Eisenhower refuses to acknowledge aggression and makes violating Soviet sovereignty a national policy of the United States, how can the Four-Power Summit reach an agreement? Agreeing to hold the Four-Power Summit under such circumstances, wouldn't that be tantamount to deceiving the people of the world together with the aggressor? This is of course unacceptable to the Soviet government. Eisenhower's statement did not eliminate obstacles, but on the contrary, completely blocked the road to convening the Four-Power Summit.
    This attitude of the U.S. government headed by Eisenhower fully confirms that the United States does not want to ease international tensions at all. The U.S.'s "Cold War" policy has not only never been relaxed, but has been intensifying. The U.S. aircraft's violation of Soviet territory is just one of a series of U.S. activities to intensify the "Cold War." In early May, at the Ministerial Council meeting of the North Atlantic Group, U.S. Secretary of State Herter called on the group to fully accelerate the implementation of a ten-year plan to expand armaments and prepare for war. On May 2, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution requiring Eisenhower to raise the issue of restoring "basic freedoms" to socialist countries in Eastern Europe at the Four-Power Summit. On May 7, Eisenhower personally ordered the resumption of underground nuclear testing. Until May 15, a few hours before the start of the Four-Power Summit, U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates, who arrived in Paris with Eisenhower, ordered a so-called "alert exercise" for the U.S. armed forces in the United States and around the world, deliberately creating an atmosphere of war. These are all actions by the United States aimed at poisoning the international atmosphere and aggravating tensions. The fact is very obvious that the United States has long planned to sabotage the Four-Power Summit. People must also see that this policy of the United States is supported by Britain and France. Although there are some differences between the British and French governments and the U.S. government, it is noted that before the Four-Power Summit, government officials from the U.S., Britain, France, and West Germany engaged in frequent diplomatic activities, and also had West German Chancellor Adenauer rush to Paris to attend the Western Four-Power Summit, and finally formulated the West's strategy at the summit. Eisenhower's statement on the 16th, which strangled the Four-Power Summit, was agreed to by Macmillan and de Gaulle. Eisenhower also said in his statement that his attitude "has the endorsement and support of my Western colleagues." It is clear that the United States and its Western partners deliberately created an atmosphere that made it impossible for the Four-Power Summit to be held. Therefore, the responsibility for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit lies entirely with the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, with the U.S. government headed by Eisenhower, and with Eisenhower himself. The United States and Western countries falsely accuse the Soviet Union of sabotaging the Paris conference, and their servants and accomplices also slander the Soviet Union by reversing black and white, but they cannot deceive people and cannot hide the truth from the world.
    The Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries have consistently advocated resolving international disputes through negotiations and have strived to reach this or that agreement in negotiations. Although whether an agreement can be reached through negotiations does not only depend on our side, we advocate conducting various negotiations with other countries. If no agreement can be reached due to the obstruction and sabotage of imperialism, the people of the world will see the true face of imperialism more clearly. Comrade Khrushchev's thorough exposure at the preliminary meeting of the Four-Power Summit this time of the fact that the United States has been pursuing and has no intention of changing its aggressive policy towards the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is really a good thing. Now everyone can see how the United States is playing a shameful double-dealing trick. On the one hand, it pretends to be willing to ease international tensions through negotiations, while on the other hand, it is actually engaged in the evil deeds of aggravating international tensions and intensifying the expansion of armaments and preparation for war. This exposure is essential for the people of the world to recognize the aggressive nature of imperialism and for the people of all countries to maintain a high degree of vigilance in the struggle for world peace.
    The people of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people, and the people of other socialist countries are engaged in unprecedented economic construction, confidently creating their new lives. We need a peaceful international environment. We have always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. To achieve peaceful coexistence, the minimum conditions are non-aggression against each other's sovereignty and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. To do this, there are no obstacles on the part of socialist countries; the obstacles come from imperialism, first and foremost from the most aggressive U.S. imperialism. This is exactly what Lenin said: "Let the American capitalists not touch us. We will not touch them." The facts are the best proof: The Soviet Union has not sent reconnaissance aircraft into U.S. airspace, while U.S. aircraft have continuously violated Soviet airspace, stealing intelligence needed to prepare for a surprise attack. China has not sent a single soldier to occupy half an inch of U.S. territory, while the United States has forcibly occupied our Taiwan by force. The United States' banditry is more than a hundred and eight thousand miles away from the principle of peaceful coexistence! Imperialism has never been willing to achieve true peaceful coexistence. Senior officials of the Eisenhower administration have even openly expressed extreme dislike for "peaceful coexistence." They are not even willing to accept it verbally. Not long ago, U.S. Vice President Nixon, while advocating that the "evolution" method could be used to realize the restoration of capitalism in Eastern Europe, claimed that the United States "cannot accept what the Soviets call peaceful coexistence." Deputy Secretary of State Dillon, as the representative of U.S. big monopoly capital in the State Department, once said: "The word 'coexistence' is both terrible and hateful," "Let us throw this temporary and unnatural idea of coexistence into the dustbin." Therefore, in order to achieve peaceful coexistence, we must rely on the broad masses of the people and wage a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism.
    Now, U.S. imperialism has fallen into a very awkward position because it has completely exposed the truth about its sabotage of the Four-Power Summit. However, U.S. imperialism is very insidious and cunning. In the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, in order to get rid of its current difficulties and buy time, it will continue to play various deceptive tricks and carry out all kinds of disguises. Therefore, people cannot be too naive and cannot have any unrealistic illusions about U.S. imperialism. In the struggle against imperialism, we must adopt the viewpoint of class analysis, and we must see through the essence of imperialism through various complex phenomena. We must know that the methods of U.S. imperialism can be changed, but its fundamental purpose of dominating the world and enslaving the people of all countries will not change, and its nature will not change. We must know that U.S. imperialism will only slightly restrain its banditry when its aggressive face is completely exposed, when its aggressive policy is firmly opposed by the people of the world and falls into complete isolation, and when it cannot save its failure by any means. "It is easier to change mountains and rivers than to alter one's character." The aggressive U.S. imperialism, which is addicted to aggression, cannot abandon its aggressive policy. The reactionary stance of imperialism is very firm, and they will not be paralyzed. Eisenhower said: "We will never compromise on our ideals or principles, nor will we weaken our determination to ensure security." Therefore, the problem is that the peace-loving people of the world, especially the people of socialist countries, must not be complacent and relax their vigilance. While steadfastly striving to resolve international disputes through negotiations, the people of all countries should always be vigilant against the war conspiracies of imperialism, and always be vigilant against the conspiracies of imperialism to carry out aggression, subversion, and sabotage. As the Peace Manifesto of sixty-four Communist and Workers' Parties in 1957 pointed out: "Peace can be maintained only by the concerted efforts of all who cherish peace, by raising vigilance against the conspiracies of warmongers, and by fully realizing that it is their sacred duty to make greater efforts to defend peace, which is still under threat." U.S. imperialists attempt to deceive and hoodwink the people of all countries with some high-sounding words, so that they will be ideologically disarmed in the face of aggressors. U.S. imperialism hopes that the people of all countries, who have good wishes for peace, will treat the man-eating jackal as a harmless animal, like Mr. Dong Guo in the Chinese fable. Therefore, in the struggle to defend world peace, the people of all countries must resolutely counter the aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism, and at the same time, they must constantly strip off its "peace" disguise, so that it can be exposed in broad daylight. Only by completely thwarting the U.S. imperialist conspiracies to prepare for war and the conspiracies to disguise "peace" can world peace be guaranteed.

### 美国破坏了四国首脑会议

    美国破坏了四国首脑会议
    酝酿已久的四国政府首脑会议还没有正式开始就被美国政府破坏了！对于凡是从阶级分析的观点来考察国际形势、而不是迷惑于某些表面现象的人，对于凡是认清帝国主义本质的人来说，这是不足为奇的。因为这是美国政府长期以来奉行的侵略政策和战争政策的结果。美国总统艾森豪威尔在英国首相麦克米伦和法国总统戴高乐的支持下，坚持对于苏联和社会主义国家实行明目张胆的侵略政策和战争政策，拒绝了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志提出的为使首脑会议得以在平等的基础上召开的起码条件，从而葬送了首脑会议。这样，美帝国主义在全世界人民面前，赤裸裸地露出了它的与世界人民为敌、与世界和平为敌的凶相。美帝国主义本质和凶相的进一步的暴露，对于世界和平和人类进步事业是一件好事。全世界人民必将从这一事件中得到有益的教训，提高觉悟，更加认清美帝国主义的真面目，更加紧密地团结起来，为粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫世界和平，进行坚持不懈的斗争。
    大家知道，在5月16日四国政府首脑会议预备会议上，赫鲁晓夫同志发表了一项声明，严正谴责美国军用飞机最近侵犯苏联领空的挑衅行动和美国政府坚持对苏联采取挑衅政策的做法，指出这完全表明了美国没有诚意达成协议并且使得在四国首脑会议上进行有成就的谈判成为不可能。赫鲁晓夫同志要求美国政府谴责对苏联的挑衅行动，宣布今后不再对苏联采取这种行动和奉行这种政策，并且严惩直接参与这次事件的罪犯。苏联所采取的这种态度是完全正义的，表达了苏联人民和社会主义各国人民的坚强意志，也是完全符合世界和平利益的。大家知道，在四国首脑会议召开的前夕，美国派遣军用飞机侵入苏联国境进行挑衅。当这种侵略行为被揭露以后，艾森豪威尔和他的政府不但毫无悔过的表示，反而公然宣布这种侵犯苏联主权的行动是美国的国策，并且表示将要继续对苏联进行这样的挑衅活动。对于美国的这种蛮横的明目张胆的侵略者的态度，任何一个具有民族自尊心的国家都不可能忍气吞声，任何一个真正关心世界和平的国家都不能不痛予斥责。苏联各地人民连日以来继续纷纷举行抗议集会，充分表示了苏联人民的无比愤慨。中国人民完全支持赫鲁晓夫同志在他的声明中所坚持的严正立场。中国人民完全同苏联人民站在一起，坚决反对美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议，坚决反对美帝国主义对苏联的侵略和挑衅。
    中国人民同所有社会主义国家的人民一样，曾经希望四国首脑会议能够取得成就，并且坚决支持苏联为促进国际紧张局势和缓而进行的努力。但是，在目前的情况下，诚如赫鲁晓夫同志所说的，苏联“不能置身于这样一些谈判参加者之列：他们中间有一个参加者把背信弃义作为对苏联的政策的基础。如果苏联政府在目前情况下参加显然注定要失败的谈判，那么，它就成了欺骗各国人民的同谋者，然而，它不想成为这种同谋者”。赫鲁晓夫同志说：“除了把政府首脑会议大约推迟六个月到八个月的时间之外，再没有更好的办法。”苏联政府的这个主张，毫无疑问得到中国人民、社会主义各国人民以及全世界一切真正爱好和平人民的充分赞同。
    在遭到了赫鲁晓夫同志的严正谴责以后，艾森豪威尔发表声明，抵赖他曾经威胁过要继续侵犯苏联国境，声言侵犯苏联领空的飞行“已经停止了，而且将不恢复”；但是，他仍然坚持说美国的这种破坏别国主权的侵略活动是“为了保障美国和自由世界的安全”的“必要措施”。而且他还说这种飞行不恢复的期限只限于他担任总统的期间。这样，艾森豪威尔就再一次露出了他的流氓的嘴脸，完全丧尽了公认的最起码的道德标准，也完全破坏了国际法的关于尊重国家主权的基本原则。这就好像一个强盗被抓住以后，在不得不答应目前停止盗窃的同时，却坚持盗窃是正当的，并且一个时期以后仍然可以盗窃。在这种情况下，作为一个主权国家的苏联，怎么能够容忍这样的欺侮呢？怎么能够同一个声言以侵犯苏联为国策的政府的首脑坐在一起来会谈呢？赫鲁晓夫同志在18日记者招待会上的声明中说：“我们不能容忍侮辱，我们有自豪感，有自己的尊严，我们是代表强大的社会主义国家的”。同样的，既然艾森豪威尔拒绝承认侵略，并且把侵犯苏联主权作为美国的国策，那末，四国首脑会议又怎么能够达成协议呢？在这种情况下同意举行四国首脑会议，那不是等于同侵略者一起欺骗世界人民吗？这当然是苏联政府所不能答应的。艾森豪威尔的声明，不但没有排除障碍，恰恰相反，完全堵塞了召开四国首脑会议的道路。
    以艾森豪威尔为首的美国政府的这种态度，完全证实了美国根本不要和缓国际紧张局势。美国的“冷战”政策，不但从来没有放松过，而且一直在变本加厉地进行着。美国飞机侵犯苏联国境，不过是美国一系列加紧“冷战”活动中的一桩。5月初，在北大西洋集团部长理事会会议上，美国国务卿赫脱要求这个集团全力加速实现扩军备战的十年计划。5月2日，美国众议院通过决议，要艾森豪威尔在四国首脑会议上提出恢复东欧社会主义国家的“基本自由”的问题。5月7日艾森豪威尔亲自下令恢复地下核试验。直到5月15日，在四国首脑会议开始前几小时，随同艾森豪威尔到达巴黎的美国国防部长盖茨下令在美国和全世界的美国武装部队进行一次所谓“戒备演习”，故意制造战争气氛。这都是美国旨在毒化国际气氛、加剧紧张局势的行动。事实很明显，美国破坏四国首脑会议是蓄谋已久的。人们还必须看到，美国的这种政策是得到英法两国支持的。尽管英法两国政府同美国政府之间存在着某些分歧，但是人们注意到，在四国首脑会议举行之前，美、英、法、西德四国的政府官员进行了频繁的外交活动，而且还要西德总理阿登纳赶到巴黎去参加西方四国首脑会议，最后制定西方在首脑会议上的策略。艾森豪威尔16日发表的扼杀四国首脑会议的声明，是得到麦克米伦和戴高乐的同意的。艾森豪威尔在他的声明中也说，他的态度“得到我的西方同僚们的赞同和支持”。很明显，美国和它的西方伙伴，存心要造成恶劣的气氛，使四国首脑会议无法举行。因此破坏四国首脑会议的责任完全在以美国为首的帝国主义集团身上，在以艾森豪威尔为首的美国政府身上，在艾森豪威尔本人的身上。美国和西方国家诬赖苏联破坏巴黎会议，它们的仆从和帮凶也颠倒黑白地诽谤苏联，但是他们是骗不了人的，是绝对掩不住世人的耳目的。
    苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家一贯主张通过谈判解决国际争端，并且努力争取在谈判中达成这种或那种的协议。虽然，能否通过谈判达成协议并不只是决定于我们方面，但是我们是主张同别国进行各种谈判的。倘若由于帝国主义的阻挠破坏而达不成任何协议，全世界人民就会更清楚地看出帝国主义的真面目。赫鲁晓夫同志这次在四国首脑会议的预备会议上，彻底揭露了美国对苏联和其他社会主义国家一直奉行并且无意改变这种侵略方针。这实在是一件好事。现在人人都可以看到，美国是怎样在玩弄可耻的两面手法。它一面佯言愿意通过谈判和缓国际紧张局势，一面却实际上在进行着加剧国际紧张局势、加紧进行扩军备战的罪恶勾当。这种揭露，对于全世界人民认清帝国主义的侵略本质，对于各国人民在争取世界和平的斗争中保持高度的警惕，是十分必要的。
    苏联人民、中国人民和其他社会主义各国人民正在进行着史无前例的经济建设，满怀信心地创造自己的新生活。我们需要和平的国际环境。我们一贯主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处。要实现和平共处，最起码的条件是互不侵犯对方的主权，互不干涉对方的内政。要做到这一点，在社会主义国家方面毫无障碍；障碍来自帝国主义，首先是最富侵略性的美帝国主义方面。这正是列宁所说的：“让美国资本家不要触犯我们。我们是不会触犯他们的。”事实是最好的证明：苏联并没有派遣侦察飞机进入美国领空，而美国飞机却连续不断地侵犯苏联领空，盗取为准备进行突然袭击所需要的情报。中国没有派遣过一兵一卒占领过美国半寸领土，而美国却以武力霸占着我国台湾。美国的强盗行径同和平共处的原则，相距岂止十万八千里！帝国主义是从来不愿意实现真正的和平共处的。艾森豪威尔政府的高级官员甚至还公开表示对“和平共处”的极端厌恶。他们甚至在口头上也不愿意接受它。不久以前，美国副总统尼克松在鼓吹可以用“演变”的办法在东欧实现资本主义复辟的同时，声称美国“不能接受苏联人所谓的和平共处”。副国务卿狄龙，作为美国大垄断资本在国务院中的代表曾经说过：“‘共处’这个字眼是既可怕又可恶的”，“让我们把这种暂时的、不自然的共处观念抛进垃圾堆。”因此，为了实现和平共处，必须依靠广大人民群众，对美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争。
    现在，美帝国主义由于完全暴露了它破坏四国首脑会议的真相，已经陷入十分尴尬的地位。但是，美帝国主义是十分阴险狡诈的，在东风日盛、西风日衰的情况下，它为了摆脱目前的困难，争取时间，还会继续玩弄这样或那样的欺骗手腕，进行形形色色的伪装，因之，人们不能太天真了，不能对美帝国主义抱有任何不切实际的幻想。在对帝国主义的斗争中，必须采取阶级分析的观点，必须透过种种复杂的现象看清帝国主义的本质。须知美帝国主义的手法可以改变，但是它称霸全世界、奴役各国人民的根本目的是不会改变的，它的本质是不会改变的。须知美帝国主义只有在它的侵略面目完全暴露，在它的侵略政策遭到全世界人民的坚决反对而陷于完全孤立，并且用任何方法也挽救不了它的失败的时候，才会稍稍收敛一下强盗气焰。“江山易改，本性难移”，侵略成性的美帝国主义，是不可能放弃它的侵略政策的。帝国主义的反动立场是十分坚定的，他们是不会麻痹的。艾森豪威尔说过：“我们绝不会从我们的理想或原则上让步，也绝不会削弱我们确保安全的决心。”因此，问题在于全世界爱好和平人民、特别是社会主义各国人民绝不能麻痹大意，放松警惕。各国人民在坚定不移地争取通过谈判解决国际争端的同时，应该时刻警惕帝国主义的战争阴谋，时刻警惕帝国主义进行侵略、颠覆、破坏活动的阴谋。正如1957年六十四个共产党和工人党的和平宣言中所指出的：“只有一切珍视和平的人们一致努力，提高对战争挑拨者的阴谋的警惕，并彻底了解到要更加努力保卫还处在威胁之下的和平是自己的神圣职责，和平才能够保持住。”美帝国主义者企图用一些冠冕堂皇的言词，欺骗和蒙蔽各国人民，使他们在侵略者面前在思想上解除武装。美帝国主义指望：抱有爱好和平的善良愿望的各国人民，会像中国寓言中的东郭先生那样，把吃人的豺狼当作无害的牲畜。因此，各国人民在保卫世界和平的斗争中，必须坚决反击美帝国主义的侵略活动，同时还必须不断地剥掉它的“和平”伪装，让它在光天化日之下原形毕露。只有彻底挫败美帝国主义准备战争的阴谋和伪装“和平”的阴谋，世界和平才能得到保障。
