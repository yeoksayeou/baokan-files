    Plow (and another poem)
    [Romania] Tudor Arghezi
    Oh, plow, who invented you?
    Did people create you to turn up the dry soil on the plains,
    so that flowers bloom all around?
    Whose hands plow the land into furrows?
    Who is the first to enter the fields at dawn,
    using field boundaries to divide the vast land?
    Who guessed that our daily food is sacred?
    Who tramples the sticky mud under the pouring rain?
    Who, in the cold darkness,
    first sliced the beloved plains into moist clods?
    And he hopes, curses, and prays?
    The poor await a bountiful harvest.
    He tills, he harvests, he sows seeds into the furrows…
    He sees this heavy burden as joy,
    and for this reason, he is forever praised!

    犁头（外一首）
    〔罗马尼亚〕屠多尔·阿尔盖齐哦，犁头，是谁将你发明的？人们把你创造了出来，是不是为了要翻起平原上干燥的泥土，好让四周鲜花怒放？是谁的手把土地犁成田沟？是谁在黎明时第一个走进田野，用田界把辽阔的田地分隔开来？是谁猜想到我们每天的粮食是神圣的？是谁在雨水浇淋下践踏着粘性的污泥？是谁在寒冷的黑暗里，把亲爱的平原最初分切成润湿的泥块？而他在希望着，咒骂着和祈祷着？穷苦的人期待着丰饶的收成。他耕地，他收获，他把种子播进田沟……他把这个沉重的负担看成欢乐，正因为这样，他就永远受到颂扬！
