Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 3rd: The Second Asian-African Economic Conference concluded here tonight after four days of meetings. The conference approved the charter of the Asian-African Economic Cooperation Organization, elected the organization's leadership, and passed several resolutions.

The Chinese delegation also protested at the conference against the election of Indonesia's Subhan as vice-chairman because he consistently opposed the spirit of cooperation between Asian and African countries and could not represent the will and aspirations of the Indonesian people. The delegates did not support Subhan, and after two votes, he only obtained a majority of one vote more than the Sudanese representative.

The head of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea protested against South Korea's membership, arguing that South Korea was occupied by foreign troops and was clearly not an independent country, and therefore was not qualified to be a member.

At the conference, some people attempted to make this conference a bridge for Western countries to carry out economic plunder of underdeveloped Asian and African countries and a tool for the expansion of monopoly capital. In response to this fact, Nan Hanchen, the head of the Chinese delegation, delivered a written speech on the 3rd, the full text of which is as follows: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen:

Allow me, on behalf of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, to express a few views and opinions on the relevant issues of this Asian-African Economic Conference.

We sincerely hope that Asian and African countries will be independent, prosperous, and strong. The key lies in independence. True and complete independence must include both political and economic independence. Without political independence, there is no way to talk about economic independence. But if the economy cannot be independent, then political independence is not complete and cannot be maintained and consolidated. This is self-evident. Imperialism understands this very well. The neo-colonialist policy pursued by the United States is precisely aimed at plundering and exploiting the Asian and African people economically in every possible way, attempting to force many Asian and African countries to remain in a subordinate position economically forever, and to be trapped in a tragic situation of poverty and exhaustion. Of course, imperialism will not forget to use various disguises and pleasant words to cover up the essence of its economic aggression. The United States' so-called "assistance to backward countries" and plans for so-called "investment and development" in economically "underdeveloped countries" are synonymous with economic aggression. From 1950 to 1958 alone, the profits squeezed by American monopoly capital from investments in "underdeveloped countries" reached more than 11.3 billion US dollars. Every dollar here is stained with the blood, sweat, and tears of the people of so-called "underdeveloped countries." The United States also uses certain international organizations to carry out bloodless economic aggression. As we all know, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, established in 1945, is a tool for American imperialism to carry out economic aggression. Recently, the United States is organizing an "International Development Association." If the word "development" is read as "plunder," it is very fitting.

The most important task for the people of our Asian and African countries at present is to resolutely oppose imperialism and colonialism. We must oppose both political oppression and economic aggression. Countless facts in history and current international relations prove that there can be no illusions about the so-called "economic assistance" and "technical cooperation" of imperialism. Furthermore, we cannot imagine that imperialism will suddenly lay down its butcher knife and become a Buddha overnight. Imperialism is imperialism. Its essence is aggression and war. It is impossible to hope that imperialism will change its nature.

We must be vigilant and good at distinguishing the various natures, forms, and tricks of imperialism, whether direct or indirect, official or non-official, economic aggression and economic plunder. We must be aware of their tricks at all times and in all places. We must be especially vigilant against those schemes that are carefully disguised and attempt to achieve the conspiracy of imperialist economic aggression by passing off fish eyes as pearls. History will prove that any country or individual who pins their hope for developing the national economy on the so-called assistance of imperialism will inevitably be forced to exchange national sovereignty for foreign aid. The result can only be that the more assistance they receive, the poorer they become. Drinking poison to quench thirst will lead to endless troubles.

For this reason, we firmly oppose the proposal to organize an Asian-African investment association. Because the relevant documents of this association clearly give the impression that this investment association will "promote the continuous flow of investment from international institutions." In other words, it will open the door wide for Western capital to invade Asian and African countries. Such an Asian-African investment association, regardless of the subjective wishes of the initiators, will inevitably become a bridge for the ambitious international investment companies of imperialist countries objectively. It runs counter to the true development of the independent economies of Asian and African countries. It will help imperialist economic aggression and will be very harmful to the people of Asian and African countries. At present, the economies of our Asian and African countries have their own difficulties. This is not difficult to understand. However, our difficulties can only be solved under the prerequisite of resolutely safeguarding our political independence and economic independence.

We advocate that the people of Asian and African countries unite and carry out economic cooperation to oppose the economic aggression of imperialism and colonialism, so as to establish their own independent and prosperous economies. We advocate that Asian and African countries should be economically independent, self-reliant, and cooperate and help each other and develop trade relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In this regard, the practice of the Chinese people provides strong evidence. In old China, we had to import large quantities of wheat and rice from foreign countries every year, but today, ten years after liberation, our grain output has more than doubled, from 108 million tons to 270.5 million tons. Steel production has increased from 158,000 tons to 13.35 million tons. China implements the policy of self-reliance, fully mobilizes the masses, resolutely implements the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In 1959, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward of 1958, it continued to achieve a Great Leap Forward in the national economy. In 1959, the total value of industrial and agricultural output increased by 31.1% compared with the Great Leap Forward of 1958, of which the total value of industrial output increased by 39.3%, and although agriculture suffered from natural disasters that had not been seen for decades, the total value of output still increased by 16.7%. The result of these two years of Great Leap Forward enabled our country to complete the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) three years ahead of schedule, in two years. And on this basis, there is sufficient basis to continue the Great Leap Forward in the long term and in an all-round way. People will not forget that when our country announced the Second Five-Year Plan, imperialism tried its best to sabotage it, propagating that it was "fundamentally impossible to achieve" and was "exaggeration and boasting." But the Chinese people completed this great plan in two years, not five years. China's national economic development plan for 1960 is a plan for continued leap forward. In 1960, the total value of industrial and agricultural output will increase by 23% compared with 1959, of which industry will increase by 29% and agriculture will increase by 12%. In the continuous Great Leap Forward of the national economy, the lives of the Chinese people have been greatly improved. The people's communes with unlimited vitality have been universally established. Everywhere there are newly built factories, schools, public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, maternity hospitals, and homes for the elderly. Women participated in production and gained true liberation. We have eliminated unemployment throughout the country. Everyone has work, and everyone has food. This is a miracle, and it is a fact. What do we rely on? Rely on the people, rely on self-reliance.

Imperialism also asserted and slandered that the United Arab Republic did not have senior technical talents and experienced managers and would not be able to manage the Suez Canal. But the facts prove that the Suez Canal is now managed much better than when it was controlled by the imperialists. Is there any doubt about this? Of course not.

We are not opposed to foreign aid. We are in favor of aid that does not have any political conditions or privileges attached. The Soviet Union has provided assistance to many Asian and African countries. This is genuine assistance, assistance based on genuine equality, friendship, and mutual assistance. It fully meets the interests of the people of Asian and African countries.

Our Chinese delegation firmly believes that the financial and economic power of Asian and African countries must be in the hands of the Asian and African people. Only this path is the path to truly developing the national economy and achieving prosperity and strength, and it is the path to true independence. In the final analysis, other paths will not work. And only this path truly conforms to the spirit of the Bandung Conference. There is no doubt that the principles of equality and mutual benefit, respect for sovereignty, and other political relations of the Bandung Conference are also principles of economic relations.

Friends, our great hundreds of millions of Asian and African people should not be discouraged or timid now that we want to be masters of our own land. We must have the heroic spirit to strive for complete economic independence. There are difficulties, but as long as the people of our Asian and African countries establish lofty ambitions, unite as one, give full play to our own strength, and do not fall into the traps of imperialism, we will definitely be able to manage our own economies well and achieve rapid development.

    我国代表南汉宸在第二届亚非经济会议上发言
    亚非亿万人民要作自己土地上的主人
    必须警惕美国新殖民主义者的经济侵略和经济掠夺的一切阴谋
    只要自力更生并在平等互利基础上合作互助就能迅速发展经济
    新华社开罗3日电　第二届亚非经济会议在举行了四天的会议以后，今晚在这里闭幕。会议批准了亚非经济合作组织的章程和选举了这个组织的领导机构，并通过了若干决议。
    中国代表团在会上还抗议印度尼西亚的苏布汉当选为副主席，因为他一贯反对亚非国家人民之间的合作精神，他不能代表印度尼西亚人民的意志和愿望。代表们都不支持苏布汉，因此经过两次投票后他只得到比苏丹代表多一票的多数。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团团长抗议南朝鲜的会员国资格，因为南朝鲜是由外国军队占领着，显然不是一个独立国家，因此没有资格成为会员国。
    在会议上，有些人士企图使这次会议成为西方国家对亚非不发达国家进行经济掠夺的桥梁和垄断资本向外扩张工具。中国代表团团长南汉宸针对这一事实在3日发表了书面发言，全文如下：大会主席，各位女士，各位先生：
    请允许我代表中华人民共和国代表团就此次亚非经济会议有关问题发表几点看法和意见。
    我们衷心希望亚非各国独立、繁荣和富强。关键在于独立。真正的完全的独立必须包括政治独立和经济独立两个方面。没有政治独立，就根本谈不到经济独立。但如果经济不能独立，则政治上的独立就不是完整的，就不能维持和巩固。这是天经地义。帝国主义很懂得这个道理。美国所奉行的新殖民主义政策，就正是为了在经济上无孔不入地对亚非人民进行掠夺和剥削，企图逼使很多亚非国家在经济上永远处于附属地位，永远陷于民穷财尽的悲惨境地。当然，帝国主义不会忘记利用各种伪装和好听的词句，来掩盖它经济侵略的实质。美国的所谓“援助落后国家”、对经济“不发达的国家”进行所谓“投资和开发”的计划，就是经济侵略的代名词。仅仅从1950年到1958年，美国垄断资本对“不发达国家”的投资所榨取的利润就达到一百十三亿多美元。这里的每一个美元都染着所谓“不发达国家”人民的血汗和眼泪。美国还利用某些国际性组织进行杀人不见血的经济侵略。众所周知，1945年成立的国际复兴开发银行就是美帝国主义进行经济侵略的工具。最近，美国又正在组织一个“国际开发协会”。如果把“开发”两个字读成“掠夺”，那就十分名副其实。
    我们亚非各国人民当前的头等重要任务就是坚决反对帝国主义和殖民主义。既要反对政治压迫，又要反对经济侵略。历史上和当前国际关系上的无数事实证明，对帝国主义的所谓“经济援助”和“技术合作”，不能存在任何幻想。更不能设想帝国主义有朝一日会突然放下屠刀，立地成佛。帝国主义就是帝国主义。它的本质就是侵略和战争。要希望帝国主义改变它的本质是不可能的。
    我们必须提高警惕，善于辨别帝国主义各种性质、各种形式、各种花样、直接或间接、官方或非官方的经济侵略和经济掠夺。随时随地洞悉其奸。要特别警惕那种经过周密伪装，企图用鱼目混珠的伎俩来实现帝国主义经济侵略的阴谋。历史将会证明，任何国家或个人，如果把发展国家经济寄托在帝国主义的所谓援助上，他就必然会被迫将国家的主权去换取外援。其结果只能是越受援助越贫困。饮鸩止渴，后患无穷。
    正因为如此，我们坚决反对关于组织亚非投资协会的建议。因为有关这个协会的文件清楚地给人一种印象，例如说，这个投资协会将“促使国际机构投资源源而来”。换言之，就是为西方资本的侵入亚非各国大开方便之门。这样一个亚非投资协会，不管发起人主观愿望如何，客观上必然成为帝国主义国家野心勃勃的国际投资公司的桥梁。同真正发展亚非各国独立的经济背道而驰。它将有助于帝国主义的经济侵略，对亚非各国人民则为害甚大。现在我们亚非各国的经济各有各的困难。这是不难理解的。然而我们的困难只有在坚决保卫我们的政治独立和经济独立的前提条件下，才能获得解决。
    我们主张亚非各国人民团结起来，进行经济合作，用以反对帝国主义和殖民主义的经济侵略，从而建立各自独立繁荣的经济。我们主张亚非各国在经济上独立自主，自力更生，并在平等互利的基础上实行合作互助和发展贸易关系。在这方面，中国人民的实践提供了有力的证据。在旧中国，我们每年不得不从外国进口大量的小麦和大米，但是解放十年后的今天，我们的粮食产量增加了一倍多，从一亿零八百万吨增加到二亿七千零五十万吨。钢产量从十五万八千吨增加到一千三百三十五万吨。中国实行自力更生的方针，充分发动群众，坚决贯彻鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，1959年在1958年大跃进的基础上，继续实现了国民经济的大跃进。1959年工农业总产值比大跃进的1958年增长31.1％，其中工业总产值增长39.3％，农业虽受了数十年未有的天灾而总产值仍增长16.7％。这两年大跃进的结果，使我国提前三年，以两年时间完成了第二个五年计划（1958—1962）的主要指标。而且在此基础上有充分根据将长期、全面地持续大跃进。人们不会忘记，就在我国宣布第二个五年计划的时候，帝国主义曾经竭力破坏，宣传所谓“根本不可能实现”，是“夸大和吹牛”。但中国人民却用两年时间，不是五年时间，完成了这个伟大的计划。我国1960年的国民经济发展计划是一个继续跃进的计划，1960年工农业总产值将较1959年增加23％，其中工业增长29％，农业增长12％。在国民经济连续不断的大跃进中，我国人民生活得到了巨大改善。具有无限生命力的人民公社普遍地建立起来了。到处是新建的工厂、学校、公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、产妇院、敬老院。妇女参加了生产，得到了真正的解放。我们已经在全国范围内消灭了失业现象。人人有工作，人人有饭吃。这是奇迹，又是事实。依靠什么？依靠人民，依靠自力更生。
    帝国主义也曾经断言和诬蔑阿联没有高级技术人才和有经验的管理人员，不会管理苏伊士运河。但事实证明，苏伊士运河现在管理得比帝国主义者控制的时候好得多。这还有疑问吗？当然没有。
    我们并不反对外援。我们赞成不附带任何政治条件和特权条件的援助。苏联对很多亚非国家进行了援助，这是真正的援助，是建立在真正平等友好互助基础上的援助。完全符合亚非各国人民利益。
    我们中国代表团坚决主张，亚非国家的财政经济大权必须掌握在亚非人民手中。只有这条道路才是真正走向发展民族经济和繁荣富强的道路，是真正独立的道路。别的道路归根结底是走不通的。也只有这条道路才是真正符合万隆会议的精神。毫无疑问万隆会议的平等互利、尊重主权等政治关系原则，同时也就是经济关系原则。
  朋友们，我们伟大的亿万亚非人民，既然要作为自己土地上的主人，就不应该气馁和胆怯。我们必须具有争取实现经济上完全独立的英雄气魄。困难是有的，但是只要我们亚非各国人民树立雄心大志，团结一致，充分发挥自己的力量，不上帝国主义的圈套，我们就一定能管理好自己的经济，而且得到迅速发展。
