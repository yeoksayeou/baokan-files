    Yibin Prefecture, Sichuan Province, has basically completed the harvesting of over 2.3 million mu of minor spring crops by May 7th.

    In the intense rush to harvest, all localities fully utilized the superiority of the communes, adopting methods of large-scale operations and specialized teams for specific tasks, greatly accelerating the harvesting progress. All 247 communes in the region have established responsibility systems at every level to ensure careful harvesting, meticulous threshing, and that every grain is returned to the granary. During the harvesting process, all seed bases, high-yield areas, and experimental fields were harvested and threshed separately to ensure that varieties were not mixed and that the purity of improved seeds was high.

    宜宾专区小春作物基本收完
    四川省宜宾专区二百三十多万亩小春作物，到5月7日已基本收完。
    各地在突击抢收中，充分发挥公社优越性，采取大兵团作战和专业队分项突击的办法，大大加快了抢收进度。全区二百四十七个公社都层层建立责任制度，保证细收精打，颗粒还仓。各地在收割中，对所有种子基地、丰产地和试验田都单收单打，做到品种不乱，良种纯度高。
