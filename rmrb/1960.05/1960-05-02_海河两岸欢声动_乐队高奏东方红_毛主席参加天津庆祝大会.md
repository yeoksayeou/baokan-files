Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 1st. The most beloved great leader of all ethnic groups in China, Chairman Mao Zedong, today celebrated the first "May Day" International Labor Day of the 1960s together with the people of Tianjin, the capital of Hebei Province.

    The central venue for today's celebration rally in Tianjin was located in the central square on the bank of the Hai River. At 12:55 PM, the band played "The East is Red," and Chairman Mao appeared on the rostrum with a smile. The entire venue erupted in jubilation. Children jumped for joy, and everyone stood up excitedly. Workers, PLA soldiers, commune members from urban and rural people's communes, and young students shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Cheers resounded along the Hai River for a long time. Chairman Mao cordially waved his hat and hand to everyone in greeting and extended holiday wishes.

    Also on the rostrum were Yang Shangkun, Alternate Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee; Liu Zihou, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and Governor of Hebei Province; Wan Xiaotang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and First Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee; Yan Dakai, Xie Xuegong, and Zhang Chengxian, Secretaries of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee; Pei Yangshan, Li Ziguang, and Zhao Yimin, Standing Committee Members of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee; Zhang Minghe, Gao Shuxun, Duan Yi, and Wang Jinshan, Vice Governors of Hebei Province; Wang Qicai, Political Commissar of the Hebei Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Meng Qingshan, Deputy Commander, as well as leaders of democratic parties and people's organizations in Hebei Province and Tianjin, and well-known model workers in Tianjin.

    Liu Zihou, Governor of Hebei Province, delivered a speech at the celebration rally. He first extended warm holiday greetings on behalf of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee to the workers on all fronts, the members of urban and rural people's communes, the PLA soldiers and militiamen, the intellectuals, and the staff members of state organs, congratulating them on the new victories they had achieved on all fronts. Liu Zihou said: Today, we are celebrating this great festival with our great leader Chairman Mao, which is a tremendous encouragement to us.

    Liu Zihou pointed out: The current situation of continuing the Great Leap Forward in Hebei Province is extremely good. On the industrial and transportation fronts, a good start has been maintained in the first few months of this year. The first quarter completed 31% of the annual plan. On the agricultural front, a mass movement to support agriculture in all aspects has been launched. The entire province is now fighting drought, sowing drought-resistant crops, and the struggle to win a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture is proceeding victoriously. From cities to the countryside, a mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on gradually realizing mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is developing vigorously. Rural people's communes have become more consolidated and developed soundly. Cities above the intermediate level in the province are vigorously establishing urban people's communes. Such an excellent situation and these new favorable conditions will certainly lead to a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. Liu Zihou said: Our current central task is to further mobilize, muster greater revolutionary vigor, and, under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, hold even higher the banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and strive to overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan for a continued Great Leap Forward. It is necessary to mobilize all forces to further develop the movement to fully support agriculture; the working people of the province must make further efforts to continue to carry out the mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement, implementing large-scale summation, promotion, and improvement; it is necessary to continue to consolidate and soundly develop urban people's communes; it is necessary to further carry out the cultural revolution and the education revolution; continue to carry out the patriotic health campaign; and also promote the movement for the broad masses of cadres, party members, workers, and peasants to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong to a greater climax, strive to improve the level of socialist and communist consciousness, hold the banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and achieve even greater victories in our socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    Then, the "May Day" parade and celebration began. Amateur art troupes composed of workers and students from Tianjin performed folk-style artistic programs in front of the rostrum. When the performers finished their programs and left the rostrum, they waved goodbye to Chairman Mao with reluctance, and Chairman Mao also applauded and waved to the performers from time to time. For more than an hour, the 50,000 people in the central square continuously burst into thunderous cheers and applause.

    After the performance of artistic programs, Chairman Mao walked from the middle of the rostrum to both the left and right sides, waving to the crowd. Another high tide of jubilation appeared in the venue, and the cheers of "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!" resounded for a long time.

    After the celebration, people held a large-scale celebration parade. The parade shouted slogans such as: "Celebrate May Day International Labor Day!" "Strive to overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan for a continued Leap Forward!" "Strive to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule!" "American aggressors get out of South Korea! Get out of South Vietnam! Get out of Japan! Get out of our territory, Taiwan!" "Long live the great unity of the working class of the world!" "Long live the victory of Marxism-Leninism!"

    Today, 3.8 million people in urban and rural areas of Tianjin participated in celebration rallies, parades, and celebrations, which were larger in scale and greater in number than any previous year. When the news spread that Chairman Mao was celebrating "May Day" with the people of Tianjin, the celebration activities of the city's people quickly set off a greater climax. In the celebration parades throughout the city, people enthusiastically cheered "Long live Chairman Mao!" The workers participating in the parade also held high various propaganda signs and charts, reporting new achievements in production to the Party, demonstrating the brilliant achievements of the technical innovation and technical revolution that swept the city. The members of the newly established people's communes in the urban areas also widely participated in the parade and celebration activities. International students from Vietnam, Mongolia, the German Democratic Republic, Burma, and other countries studying at Tianjin University and Nankai University also participated in the celebrations with Chinese students.

    接着，开始了庆祝“五一”游行和联欢。由天津市的工人、学生们组成的业余文艺队伍表演着富有民间风格的文艺节目经过主席台前。演员们表演完节目离开主席台的时候，依依不舍地向毛主席招手致敬，毛主席也不时地向表演者们鼓掌、招手。在一个多小时中，中心广场上的五万人连续不停地爆发出雷鸣般的欢呼声和掌声。
    文艺节目表演过后，毛主席从主席台的中间走向左右两侧，向群众招手致意。会场上又出现了欢腾的高潮，“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声经久不息。
    联欢结束后，人们举行了大规模的庆祝游行。游行的队伍振臂高呼：“庆祝五一国际劳动节！”
  “为超额完成1960年国民经济继续跃进的计划而奋斗！”“为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗！”“美国侵略者从南朝鲜滚出去！从南越滚出去！从日本滚出去！从我国的领土台湾滚出去！”“全世界工人阶级的大团结万岁！”“马克思列宁主义的胜利万岁！”
