Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 13th: Speech by Tran Duy Hung, Chairman of the Hanoi City Administrative Committee, at the mass rally welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai this morning: Respected Premier Zhou Enlai, Respected Vice Premier Chen Yi, Dear comrades and friends:

　　We, the people of the capital city of Hanoi, are honored for the second time to welcome here Premier Zhou Enlai, the most intimate friend of the Vietnamese people and the representative of the great 650 million Chinese people.

　　On behalf of the people of our capital and the entire Vietnamese people, I would like to extend my warmest respects to Respected Comrade Premier Zhou Enlai, Respected Comrade Vice Premier Chen Yi, and the comrades accompanying them.

　　We, the people of the capital city of Hanoi, warmly congratulate the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, on the great achievements they have made in the cause of socialist construction. The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes have greatly promoted the development of all aspects of China. China's remarkable achievements are a source of pride for the entire socialist camp, including the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and they have made an important contribution to strengthening the power of the socialist camp headed by the mighty Soviet Union. More than three years ago, when Comrade Premier visited Vietnam, we had just victoriously completed land reform, and we were still in the period of economic recovery. Today, Hanoi is nearing the completion of the collectivization of agriculture, handicrafts, and small traders, and has basically completed the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, while strengthening socialist construction. Many new factories have appeared in the city and suburbs. Many construction sites are busily engaged in the construction of new factories, cultural buildings, and civil engineering projects. Among these projects that are under construction and have been completed, many have been aided by the People's Republic of China. While happily reporting on Hanoi's preliminary construction achievements to Comrade Premier, I cannot fail to mention the selfless labor spirit and the brilliant example of proletarian internationalism of the Chinese expert comrades, who wholeheartedly help us develop our economy and culture, build new projects, work day and night with Vietnamese technicians and workers, and impart valuable knowledge and experience to them. The Vietnamese people sincerely thank the Chinese expert comrades, and sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party.

　　The People's Republic of China is a peaceful and powerful country in the world, and a country that advocates the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China has resolutely implemented the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and is resolutely striving for the complete realization of these principles. The Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression and the agreement on border issues signed between China and Burma, and the Treaty of Peace and Friendship and the agreement on border issues signed between China and Nepal, are major new victories for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Premier Zhou Enlai's and Vice Premier Chen Yi's visits to India, Burma, Nepal, Cambodia, and other countries once again demonstrate China's consistent sincerity in faithfully implementing a peaceful foreign policy and a policy of friendship between all nations. The Vietnamese people warmly welcome this correct foreign policy of the fraternal People's Republic of China.

　　Comrades, friends, and fellow compatriots:

　　Today, as we welcome Comrade Premier and Comrade Vice Premier, we are excited about the continuous victories of the world's peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism. We are happy for the great achievements of the fraternal Chinese people and for the increasing prestige of the People's Republic of China on the international stage. We firmly believe that the friendship between the people of the two fraternal countries of Vietnam and China will surely become increasingly close and last forever, that the socialist construction cause of the two peoples will surely achieve even more brilliant success, and that the Vietnamese people's struggle for the reunification of their motherland and the Chinese people's struggle for the liberation of Taiwan will surely achieve final victory!

　　Comrade Premier, Comrade Vice Premier: The people of Hanoi are honored to represent the entire Vietnamese people in welcoming you and asking you to convey the heartfelt congratulations of the Vietnamese people to the fraternal Chinese people through this commemorative banner embroidered with the sincere words "The Friendship Between Vietnam and China Will Last Forever". Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Vietnamese people and the Chinese people! Long live the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union! Long Live world peace! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live President Ho!

    越南人民为统一祖国的斗争定能胜利
    河内市行政委员会主席陈维兴在河内群众大会上的讲话
    新华社河内13日电　河内市行政委员会主席陈维兴在今天早晨欢迎周恩来总理的群众大会上的讲话全文：敬爱的周恩来总理，敬爱的陈毅副总理，亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    我们首都河内人民，这是第二次荣幸地在这里迎接越南人民最亲密的朋友、伟大的六亿五千万中国人民的代表周恩来总理。
    我谨代表我们首都人民和全体越南人民，向敬爱的周恩来总理同志、敬爱的陈毅副总理同志和随行同志们致以最亲切的敬意。
    我们首都河内人民热烈地祝贺中国共产党和毛主席英明领导下的中国人民在建设社会主义事业中所取得的伟大成就。总路线、大跃进和人民公社化运动大大地推进了中国各方面的发展。中国卓越的成就，使得包括越南民主共和国在内的整个社会主义阵营引为自豪，它为增强以强大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量作出了重要贡献。三年多以前，当总理同志访问越南的时候，我们刚刚胜利地完成土地改革，我们还只处在经济恢复时期。而今天河内已经快要完成农业、手工业、小商贩的合作化，基本完成了资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，同时加强了社会主义建设，市内和市郊出现了许多新工厂。许多工地上正在热火朝天地投入新的工厂、文化建筑物和民用工程的建设。在这些正在建设和已经建成的工程中，有不少是中华人民共和国援助我们的。在高兴地向总理同志报告河内的初步建设成绩的时候，我不能不提到中国专家同志们的忘我劳动精神和无产阶级国际主义精神的光辉榜样，他们全心全意地帮助我们发展经济和文化，建设新的工程，夜以继日地同越南技术人员和工人们一起工作，并向他们传授了宝贵的知识和经验。越南人民真诚地感谢中国专家同志们，真诚地感谢中国共产党。
    中华人民共和国是世界上的一个和平强国，是倡导和平共处五项原则的一个国家。中国已经坚决地执行了和平共处五项原则，并且正在为这一原则的彻底实现而坚决奋斗。中国和缅甸签订的友好和互不侵犯条约和关于边界问题的协定，中国和尼泊尔签订的和平友好条约和关于边界问题协定，是和平共处五项原则的重大的新胜利。周恩来总理和陈毅副总理对印度、缅甸、尼泊尔、柬埔寨等国的访问，再一次说明了中国一贯诚心诚意地忠实执行和平外交政策和各民族之间的友好政策。越南人民热烈欢迎兄弟的中华人民共和国的这个正确的外交政策。
    同志们，朋友们，全体同胞们：
    今天，在欢迎总理同志和陈毅副总理同志的时候，我们为全世界的和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义事业的接连不断的胜利感到兴奋。我们为兄弟的中国人民的伟大成就，为中华人民共和国在国际舞台上威信日益提高感到高兴。我们坚信，越中两个兄弟国家的人民之间的友谊一定能够日益密切、万古长青，两国人民的社会主义建设事业一定会取得更辉煌的成功，越南人民为统一祖国和中国人民为解放台湾的斗争一定会取得最后胜利！
    总理同志，副总理同志：河内人民能够荣幸地代表全越南人民欢迎你们并请你们把越南人民的亲切的祝贺，通过这面绣着“越中友谊万古长青”的真诚的字句的纪念锦旗，转达给兄弟的中国人民。越南人民和中国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊万岁！以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结万岁！世界和平万岁！毛主席万岁！胡主席万岁！
