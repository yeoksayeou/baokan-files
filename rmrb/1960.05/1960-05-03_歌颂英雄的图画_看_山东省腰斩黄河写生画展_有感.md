Paintings Praising Heroes
    ——Thoughts on the "Shandong Province Cutting the Yellow River in Half Sketch Exhibition"
    Li Qun
      "To make high mountains bow their heads, to make rivers give way," this is the heroic aspiration of our laboring people in the great cause of building socialism since the Great Leap Forward, after realizing the power of the collective. This sentence embodies the spirit of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism.
    In the past, making a small stream give way was easy, but making the Yellow River give way could only be regarded as a myth. However, today, in the socialist era, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, all these so-called myths have the possibility of becoming reality. Isn't the miracle of Shandong Province cutting the Yellow River in half last winter a vivid example of turning myth into reality!
    Shandong has been a place of heroes and good men since ancient times. The legendary Qin Qiong and Wu Song have been praised by people of all generations. However, Wu Song's skills, no matter how great, could only kill tigers, and it was impossible to tame the Yellow River. But in the socialist era, the collective Wu Song of Shandong created the miracle of cutting the Yellow River in half, something that the individual Wu Song of that year could never have dreamed of.
    We did not witness the birth of this miracle, but through the "Shandong Province Cutting the Yellow River in Half Sketch Exhibition" now being held in Beijing, we can feel as if we are on the scene, not only understanding how the Yellow River was cut in half through various paintings, but also seeing the vivid images and heroic spirit of the heroes engaged in cutting the Yellow River, which moves us deeply.
    Historically, the Yellow River has been a long-term scourge, bringing countless disasters to the people of Shandong. However, today, after being cut in half, it will bring endless happiness to the people of Shandong. Such a great water conservancy project, under the day and night struggle of 220,000 Shandong heroes, built a dam and cut off the river in the Weishan area in fourteen days. During this process, countless heroic figures emerged, waiting for poets to sing about and painters to depict.
    According to the instructions of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial Cultural Bureau and the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles organized the "Cutting the Yellow River Literary and Art Service Team" to serve at the construction site in early December last year. Among them were literary and art warriors in fine arts, literature, music, drama, and other fields. The sketches now on display in Beijing are mostly drawn by the fine arts workers in the service team, who worked day and night at the construction site, living and working with the migrant workers, and drawing in their spare time. In one month, they painted more than a thousand works, which were exhibited at the construction site, greatly boosting the morale of the migrant workers and were welcomed by thousands of people. The large number of Shandong fine arts workers who participated in the Yellow River cutting construction site labor and the great achievements they made are worthy of study by many of our fine arts workers. Also participating in this exhibition are the collective works of the fine arts group of the "Shandong Xiashan Reservoir Literary and Art Service Team" and the collective works of the fine arts group of the "Shandong Yimeng Mountain Area Water Conservancy Construction Literary and Art Service Team." All of these works, except for a few painted by painters and fine arts teachers, are mostly painted by students of the Fine Arts Department of the Shandong Art Academy. They are still at the high school level, but due to the close combination of fine arts teaching and practice, treating the construction site as a classroom for learning, the achievements they have made are truly an exciting leap forward. Since these works were all painted in a relatively short period of time, although some are only sketches and some lack further refinement, many works have abundant feelings and vivid images, and many works have a strong atmosphere of life and a fighting atmosphere. For example, "A Creation Unmatched in the World," "Night Battle," "Rolling Dragon Coat," "Heroes Battle Dragon Gate," and "Father and Son Heroes Compete" have all left us with a deep impression. The authors are not standing by and watching coldly, but are breathing the same air and sharing the joys with the migrant workers. Therefore, with one stroke of the pen, they express the true feelings of the builders and the spirit of the Great Leap Forward; they did not stay at the flat record of the construction site scene, but expressed the enthusiasm of the masses and the collective's tense battle under the leadership of the Party, and expressed the people's awareness and enthusiasm in labor. Without this communist drive and enthusiasm, it would be impossible to "make high mountains bow their heads, to make rivers give way." And only by expressing this spirit can the positive role of fine arts be better played. Compared with those paintings that look quite skilled in sketching and have good color effects, but the characters feel stiff and lifeless, these works are many times better. Saying this does not mean that we can ignore the cultivation of sketching and color effects, but that the cultivation of sketching and color effects must serve the expression of the characters' mental state. Shandong fine arts workers have created many moving works, which is obviously the result of putting politics in command; otherwise, they could not have been painted in such a short period of time.
    Their experience is worthy of study by fine arts education workers. While celebrating the leap forward achievements made by Shandong fine arts workers, we hope that they can better study and research the principle of "combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism" put forward by Chairman Mao, and take a further step forward in their future creations.

### 歌颂英雄的图画——看“山东省腰斩黄河写生画展”有感

    歌颂英雄的图画
    ——看“山东省腰斩黄河写生画展”有感
    力群
      “要高山低头，要河水让路”，这是我国大跃进以来，英雄的劳动人民在建设社会主义的伟大事业中，认识到集体的力量之后表示他们雄心壮志的豪语。这一句话体现了革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的精神。
    在过去，要一条小溪让路，这是容易办到的，可是，要黄河让路，就只能被看作是神话。然而在今天，在社会主义时代，在中国共产党领导之下，这些所谓神话就都有可能成为现实，去年冬天山东省腰斩黄河的奇迹，不正是使神话成为现实的一个活生生的事例吗！
    山东是自古以来出英雄好汉的地方，传说中的秦琼、武松都受到历代人民的称道。然而武松的本领天大也只能打死老虎，而决不可能驯服黄河。可是在社会主义的时代，山东的集体武松就创造了腰斩黄河的奇迹，这在当年的个体武松作梦也梦不到的。
    我们未能目睹这个奇迹的产生，但通过现在在北京举行的“山东省腰斩黄河写生画展”，却能使我们有如身临其境，不仅通过各种画面了解到如何腰斩黄河，而且看到了从事于腰斩黄河的英雄们的生动形象和英雄气概，使我们为之感动。
    黄河在历史上是长期为害的，曾给山东人民带来数不尽的灾难，然而在今天，腰斩之后，就要使它给山东人民带来万代幸福。这样伟大的水利工程，在二十二万山东好汉的日夜奋战之下，于位山地区以十四天的时间建成了大坝，截断了河流。这当中出现了不知多少英雄人物，有待诗人歌唱，有待画家描绘。
    根据山东省委指示，省文化局和省文联在去年12月初组织了“腰斩黄河文艺服务团”到工地服务，其中有美术、文学、音乐、戏剧等方面的文艺战士。现在在北京展出的写生画，其中有大部分就是服务团中的美术工作者们在工地夜以继日地奋战，同民工同志们生活在一起，劳动在一起抽空画出来的。他们在一个月的时间里就画了一千多幅作品，在工地曾进行了展出，有力地鼓舞了民工们的干劲。受到了千千万万群众的欢迎。这次参加腰斩黄河工地劳动的山东美术工作者，其人数之多，成就之大，很值得我们许多美术工作者们学习。参加这次画展的，还有“山东峡山水库文艺服务团”美术组集体创作的作品和“山东省沂蒙山区水利建设文艺服务团”美术组集体创作的作品。所有这些作品，除了少数是画家和美术教员画的外，其余大部都是山东艺专美术专修科的学生们画的，他们还是高中程度，然而由于美术教学和实际的紧密结合，把工地场面当作课堂的学习，所取得的成就真是一个令人兴奋的大跃进。由于这些作品都是在较短时日中画出来的，虽然有的还只是一些速写，有的还缺乏进一步的提炼加工，然而很多作品都具有充沛的感情和生动的形象，很多作品都有强烈的生活气息和战斗气氛。例如“举世奇创”、“夜战”、“滚龙衣”、“英雄大战龙门口”和“父子英雄双竞赛”等都给我们留下了深刻的印象。作者们不是站在旁边冷眼观看，而是与民工们同呼吸共欢乐，因而一落笔就表现了建设者们的真实的感情和大跃进时代的气魄；他们没有停留在对于工地场面的平板的纪录，而是表现了在党领导下群众的干劲和集体的紧张战斗，表现了人民在劳动中的自觉和热情。没有这种共产主义的干劲和热情，“要高山低头、要河水让路”是万万办不到的。而只有表现了这种精神才能更好地发挥美术的积极作用。这些作品比之那些从表面上看颇有素描修养、色彩效果而人物却感到是死板无神的绘画，不知要高明多少倍。这样说，并不意味着我们可以不重视素描修养和色彩效果，而是说必须使素描修养和色彩效果为表现人物的精神状态服务。山东美术工作者创作了许多动人的作品，显然是政治挂帅的结果，否则在短短的时日中是画不出来的。
    他们的经验值得美术教育工作者们研究学习。我们在庆祝山东美术工作者们所取得的跃进成绩的同时，希望他们能更好地深入研究毛主席提出的“革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合”的原则，在今后的创作上更提高一步。
