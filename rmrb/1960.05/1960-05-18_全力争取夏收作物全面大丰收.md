The struggle to achieve a bumper harvest of summer crops is developing victoriously across the country. In another twenty or thirty days, the outcome will be known. The urgent task for rural people's communes and state-owned farms is to strive in every possible way to harvest more grain and oil crops this summer, while victoriously completing spring sowing.

The sown area of overwintering summer crops and spring-sown summer crops this year is larger than in previous years. Winter wheat has increased by 50 million mu compared to last year; early rice may have increased by more than 30 million mu compared to last year; and the sown area of rapeseed and spring wheat has also increased. All regions should take advantage of these extremely favorable conditions, make a final effort, and further increase the yield per unit area of various summer crops. This is an extremely important factor in fulfilling and overfulfilling the annual agricultural production plan.

It is entirely possible to achieve an all-around bumper harvest of summer crops this year. Although the continuous rain in the south and the constant drought in the north this year will affect the growth of wheat. However, the foundation for this year's summer crops has been well laid. This year, the wheat planted in various regions is of high quality, and great efforts have been made in the winter and spring management of wheat. Relying on the powerful strength of the people's communes, the major wheat-producing areas in the north have fully utilized the huge benefits of water conservancy projects, actively expanded the irrigated area of wheat fields, and overcome the severe drought unseen in decades, allowing wheat to smoothly pass the greening stage, jointing and booting stage, and heading stage, and now it has entered the grain-filling stage. Various regions have vigorously developed high-yield wheat fields, realizing garden-style management, with large-area high-yield fields accounting for about 30% of the total wheat area, becoming a powerful base for increasing wheat production. The broad masses generally recognize that this year's wheat is characterized by deep roots, strong stalks, and many ears. According to inspections in various regions, first and second-class wheat generally account for 80-90%, while third-class wheat only accounts for 10-20%, and even this year's third-class wheat is growing better than in previous years. This year's rapeseed and summer coarse grains are also planted and managed better than in previous years. Recently, spring wheat sowing has been completed in several provinces and regions in the north, and early rice transplanting in the south has been completed in some areas and is underway in others. All summer crop production this year embodies the principle of combining multiple planting and multiple harvesting with high yield and multiple harvesting, laying the foundation for achieving an all-around bumper harvest in summer.

Achieving a bumper harvest of summer crops is now at a crucial stage. Among the summer crops, rapeseed is ripening and needs to be harvested in a timely manner to ensure a bumper harvest. Other crops are in their vigorous growth period and need to be strengthened in cultivation and management. The 360 million mu of winter wheat is the most important summer crop. How much winter wheat increases its yield has a pivotal impact on the total output of summer crops. Winter wheat is currently flowering and filling grains, requiring a large amount of nutrients and water. It is now necessary to conduct a serious inspection of all wheat fields (including those that have already been top-dressed and watered), and immediately apply quick-acting fertilizer if the fertilizer is insufficient; if there is a shortage of water, as long as there is a water source, it must be watered again. It is necessary to seize the time to apply fertilizer and water to the existing 10% or 20% of third-class wheat, and promote their "upgrading." Jining Prefecture in Shandong recently conducted an inspection and found that among the 8.56 million mu of wheat in the entire area, there were still more than 2.17 million mu of third-class wheat, with only 200,000 to 300,000 effective tillers per mu, and the seedlings were weak and yellow. Each county in the prefecture universally formed specialized teams to make a concentrated effort to manage the "third-class wheat," and promptly applied more than 7 million jin of quick-acting fertilizer to the third-class wheat fields, and also drilled more than 30,000 new wells, watering most of the third-class wheat. As a result, 1.56 million mu of third-class wheat was "upgraded." Preventing lodging is a major event in the late-stage management of wheat fields, and preparations for preventing lodging should be made as early as possible. Diseases and insect pests, especially rust, are major enemies of wheat growth in the late stage, and vigilance should be maintained at all times, and timely prevention and control should be carried out. Some areas are still currently experiencing drought and need to continue to widely dig water sources to combat drought and irrigate wheat. Our slogan is "Wheat is not harvested, management does not stop!" We must persist in the effort to achieve a bumper harvest until the wheat is stored in the warehouse.

If the harvest of winter wheat has not yet been determined, then it can be said that the struggle to achieve a bumper harvest of early rice, spring wheat, and spring-sown summer coarse grains has just begun. The success of these summer crops mainly depends on the efforts in the coming period. This year's early rice planting area is larger than last year, accounting for about one-fifth of the total summer crop area, and its output accounts for a considerable proportion of the total summer crop output. A large part of this year's early rice is transplanted with rice transplanters. Transplanting with rice transplanters not only has high efficiency, which is conducive to seizing the agricultural season and promoting early rice development, but also has good quality, which can better achieve the specifications of reasonable close planting and ensure the increase of yield per unit area. Those places that are currently transplanting rice should continue to exert the power of rice transplanters, and on the basis of ensuring the quality of transplanting, accelerate the transplanting progress and complete the early rice planting plan satisfactorily. After transplanting, field management should be strengthened immediately to make the seedlings quickly turn green.

Strengthening leadership over the weak links of summer crops is the key to achieving an all-around bumper harvest. In the past, some areas put a lot of effort into cultivating many high-yield fields, but the overall output did not increase quickly, because it was "held back" by low-yield fields. This phenomenon must be changed. It is necessary to use the method of "grasping both ends and leading the middle," on the one hand, to build high-yield fields on a large scale, and on the other hand, to transform low-yield fields, and strive for balanced production increase and greatly increase the total output of crops. The Nanyang Prefectural Committee of Henan Province established high-yield fields in the Liusi low-yield area at the junction of Nanyang, Fangcheng and other counties. 10,700 mu of wheat is growing vigorously, turning this historically low-yield area into a high-yield area. This shows that it is entirely possible to transform low-yield fields at a high speed, and things are not as difficult as some people imagine.

In the continuous leap forward of agricultural production in our country in the past year and the year before, an important experience has been obtained, that is, "promoting autumn with summer." First, strive for a bumper harvest in summer, which can not only create the necessary material conditions for a bumper harvest in autumn, but also set up pacesetters, create great momentum, inspire people's greater revolutionary spirit, and increase people's confidence in striving for a greater bumper harvest. The production increase movement of "the next season catching up with the last season and surpassing the last season" and "late rice catching up with early rice and surpassing early rice" that appeared in agricultural production in the past two years was formed in this way. We should use this experience to strive for a greater summer harvest than in the past, promote a greater autumn harvest than in the past, and strive for the victorious realization of the continued leap forward in agricultural production in 1960.

### 全力争取夏收作物全面大丰收

    全力争取夏收作物全面大丰收
    争取夏收作物大丰收的斗争，正在全国各地胜利发展。再有二、三十天就要见分晓了。农村人民公社和国营农场当前的紧迫任务，就是要在胜利完成春耕播种的同时，千方百计地争取在今年夏季收获更多的粮食和油料。
    今年的越冬夏收作物和春播夏收作物的播种面积比往年多。冬小麦比去年增加了五千万亩；早稻比去年可能增加三千多万亩；油菜、春小麦的播种面积也增加了。各地应当利用这样极其有利的条件，鼓最后一把劲，进一步提高各种夏收作物的单位面积产量。这是完成和超额完成全年农业生产计划的一个极为重要的因素。
    争取今年夏收作物全面大丰收，是完全可能的。虽然今年出现的南方连续阴雨和北方不断干旱，会影响小麦的生长。但是，今年的夏收作物底子打得好。今年各地的小麦种的又多又好，对于小麦的越冬管理和春期管理也抓的很紧。北方主要产麦区依靠人民公社的强大力量，充分发挥水利工程的巨大效益，积极扩大麦田灌溉面积，战胜了数十年所未见的严重干旱，使小麦顺利度过了返青关、拔节孕穗关、抽穗关，目前已经进入灌浆阶段。各地大搞麦田丰产方，实现园田化，大面积丰产田占到麦田总面积30％左右，成为麦类增产的强大阵地。广大群众公认今年小麦的特点是：根深、株壮、穗多。据各地检查，今年一、二类麦一般占百分之八、九十，三类麦只有百分之一、二十，今年的三类麦也比往年的三类麦长得好。今年的油菜和夏杂粮也比往年种得好、管得好。最近，北方几个省、区的春麦播种已经完成，南方的早稻插秧，一部分地区已经完成，一部分地区正在进行。今年全部夏收作物生产都体现了多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针，为争取夏季全面大丰收奠定了基础。
    争取夏收作物大丰收，现在正是关键时期。在夏收作物中，油菜正在成熟，需要及时收获，保证丰产丰收。别的作物都在生长旺期，需要加强培育管理。三亿六千万亩冬小麦，是最重要的夏收作物。冬小麦增产多少，对于夏收作物总产量有举足轻重的作用。冬小麦正在扬花和灌浆，需要大量养分和水分。现在有必要对全部麦田（包括那些已经追过肥、浇过水的麦田）进行一次认真的检查，肥料不足的，立即追施速效肥料；缺水的，只要有水源，一定要再浇一次水。要抓紧时间，对现有的10％或20％的三类麦加肥加水，促使它们“升级”。山东济宁专区最近作了一次检查，发现全区八百五十六万亩小麦中，还有二百一十七万多亩三类麦，每亩有效分蘖只有二十万至三十万株，苗株瘦弱发黄。这个专区各县普遍组成专业队伍，突击管理“三类麦”，及时把七百多万斤速效肥料追施到三类麦田里，还增打了三万多眼新井，给大部分三类麦浇了水，结果，有一百五十六万亩三类麦“升级”了。防倒伏是麦田后期管理上的一件大事，要早日作好防倒伏的准备。病虫害，特别是锈病，是小麦生长后期的大敌，要时时提高警惕，及时加以防治。有些地方目前仍然干旱，需要继续广挖水源，抗旱浇麦。我们的口号是“小麦不收，管理不休！”要把争取大丰收的努力，一直坚持到小麦入仓为止。
    如果说冬小麦的收成尚未定局，那末，可以说，争取早稻、春小麦和春播夏杂粮丰收的斗争，现在是刚刚开始。这些夏收作物的收成如何，主要地决定于今后一段时间的努力。今年早稻种植面积比去年多，约占全部夏收作物总面积的五分之一，它的产量在夏收作物总产量中的比重相当大。今年的早稻有很大一部分是用插秧机插秧的。用插秧机插秧，不仅效率高，有利于抢农时，促进早稻早发育；而且质量好，可以更好地实现合理密植的规格，保证单位面积产量的提高。目前正在插秧的地方，要继续发挥插秧机的威力，在保证插秧质量的基础上，加快插秧进度，圆满完成早稻种植计划。插秧以后，要马上加强田间管理，使秧苗迅速转青。
    加强对夏收作物薄弱环节的领导，是争取全面丰收的关键。过去，有些地区用力培养了不少丰产田，但是总产量提高并不快，原因是被低产田“拖住腿”了。这种现象必须改变。要运用“抓两头带中间”的方法，一方面大建丰产方，一方面改造低产田，力争平衡增产，大大提高农作物总产量。河南省南阳地委在南阳、方城等县交界的刘寺低产区建立了丰产方，一万零七百亩小麦生长旺盛，使这块历史上的低产区变成高产区。这说明，高速度地改造低产田是完全可能的，事情并不像某些人所想像的那样困难。
    我国农业生产在去年和前年的连续跃进中，取得了一项重要的经验，就是“以夏促秋”。首先争取夏季丰收，不仅可以为秋季大丰收创造必要的物质条件，而且可以树立标兵，大造声势，鼓起人们更大的革命干劲，增长人们争取更大丰收的信心。过去两年农业生产中出现的“下季赶上季超上季”“晚稻赶早稻超早稻”的增产运动，就是这样形成的。我们应当运用这条经验，争取一个比过去更大的夏季丰收，促进一个比过去更大的秋季丰收，为胜利实现1960年农业生产继续跃进而奋斗。
