Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd - Our correspondent reports: Moscow and newspapers across the Soviet Union continue to devote considerable space to reporting on the mass outrage of the Soviet people protesting against the U.S. plane's intrusion and America's sabotage of the summit talks. In recent days, this movement has been developing more broadly and deeply. In addition to holding protest and condemnation rallies, laboring people in various places have been writing letters and articles to newspapers, sending telegrams, and submitting protest letters to express their anger and their resolute support for the solemn stance taken by the Soviet government.

Throughout the Soviet land, from Moscow to the distant frontiers, from the shores of the Pacific to the Baltic coast, the protests of over two hundred million Soviet people have converged into a sea of anger. From the materials that have already been revealed, people have gained a clearer understanding of the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism, its long-standing deceptive tactics of feigned peace, and its ambition to dare to invade the Soviet Union. In factories, workers have expressed their determination to work harder, complete production plans ahead of schedule, produce more products for the country, and further enhance the country's economic power. Collective farmers have expressed their determination to strive for a bumper harvest this year in order to obtain more grain reserves. Soldiers of the armed forces have stated that they will increase vigilance, improve combat qualities, and strengthen combat training in order to repulse any adventurous invasions by aggressors.

The "Pravda" newspaper devoted its entire third page on the 22nd to reflect the will of people from all walks of life in the Soviet Union to support the solemn stance of the Soviet government.

Socialist Labor Hero and Lenin Prize laureate Postovit said in the newspaper that the provocative actions of the American militarists on the eve of the summit conference showed that the U.S. government talked about peace but did not, in fact, want to ease international tensions. Now, everyone has seen who wants peace and who is pursuing adventurous policies. He emphasized that the U.S. ruling group must bear full responsibility for destroying the summit conference.

The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions held its fourth plenary session on the 20th. The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution firmly protesting against the U.S. government's policies and its actions to sabotage the summit conference. The participants of the plenary session, representing fifty-five million trade union members across the Soviet Union, warmly supported the Soviet government's peaceful foreign policy and stance.

Dorokhin, a member of the Salayev Collective Farm in Stavropol, said that U.S. imperialism is playing a dangerous game of playing with fire. We want to warn these warmongers that if they dare to launch a war, they will face destruction. He also said that the Soviet people unanimously support the Soviet government's solemn stance. The Soviet people will further consolidate their national defense and do everything possible to build the motherland better. No one is allowed to violate the sacred territory of the Soviet Union.

Academician Tsitsin of the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences said that the dirty and shameless planes of the American espionage agencies intruded into the sacred airspace of the Soviet Union, resulting in the planes being shot down and the spies being sanctioned. The Four-Power Summit also failed to take place due to the impudence of the U.S. rulers. In this way, American imperialists have exposed themselves to the people of the world as enemies of peace. He went on to say that the powerful Soviet economy and advanced science and culture have transformed the Soviet Union into a mighty fortress, before which any imperialist aggression will be smashed to pieces.

Kochetkov, director of the Ordzhonikidze Machine Tool Factory in Moscow, said that if the claws of the beast dare to reach over our border, then its claws should be cut off! The Soviet people will be merciless towards the aggressors. He also said that the face of U.S. imperialism, which is sabotaging peace and carrying out aggression, has been completely exposed and condemned by the righteous people of the world. The Soviet people will be more vigilant against the enemy's aggressive activities and stand ready to strike at the aggressors at any time.

Responsible personnel from the Communist Party, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations of Kazan University jointly wrote a letter, representing the teachers and students of Kazan University, calling on scholars and university students from all countries to condemn the U.S.'s perfidious policies.

The officers and soldiers of the Soviet army, who established great achievements for mankind in the past anti-fascist war, were even more furious in the face of the U.S. imperialism's despicable conspiracy to intensify international tensions. "Severely punish the American aggressors!" "If the war provokers dare to act rashly, give them a fatal blow!" - This is the strong voice unanimously issued by the vast numbers of officers and soldiers. At large and small gatherings, they confidently expressed their determination to continue strengthening combat readiness, annihilating the enemy of peace who comes to invade, whether they appear in the air, on land, or at sea.

The officers and soldiers of a certain rocket unit in the Ural Military District, who severely punished the American air bandits, stated at the rally that they will continue to stand by, not letting go of any aggressor. Captain Kolosov said at the meeting that we soldiers warmly support Khrushchev's statement, which gave the war provokers a head-on blow.

At the rally of a certain unit, Major Marchenko said that the wealthy merchants across the ocean have forgotten who they are dealing with. Anyone who carries out aggression against our country will be severely hit. We have ways to defend the borders of the motherland. What awaits the aggressors is the same fate as the Nazi bandits.

The newspapers of the Soviet army have been publishing editorials or articles for days, denouncing the shameless acts of U.S. imperialism and calling on the various combat units to be vigilant against the conspiracies of the aggressors. The "Red Star" newspaper said in its editorial on the 18th that Soviet soldiers, like all Soviet people, angrily condemn the U.S. politicians, and the soldiers guarantee to be more prepared for combat and improve their combat skills.

Xinhua News Agency, 22nd - According to TASS, laboring people from all walks of life in urban and rural areas across the Soviet Union continue to hold various rallies and mass meetings, unanimously angrily condemning the shameful acts of the U.S. ruling group and resolutely supporting the solemn stance of the Soviet government.

The Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee held a meeting in Moscow. The meeting adopted a resolution condemning the aggressive actions of the U.S. ruling group that sabotaged the Four-Power Summit and fully supporting the Soviet government's peaceful foreign policy.

Soviet painters held a gathering in Moscow. In the resolution passed at the meeting, they said: "We support Khrushchev's statements at the preparatory meeting of the Four-Power Summit and at the press conference in Paris. These statements thoroughly exposed the despicable war provokers in front of the world and put them in a scandalous situation."

Moscow film workers also held a gathering. Film critic Kremlev said at the meeting that we indignantly condemn those who deliberately worsen the international atmosphere.

At a gathering of people from all walks of life in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, Academician Semenenko of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Chairman of the Ukrainian Republic Committee for the Defense of Peace, said that the banditry of the American militarists, the White House's dispatch of spy planes to intrude into Soviet airspace, has aroused the anger of all progressive mankind.

The Ordzhonikidze Mining Institute in East Caucasus held a school-wide assembly of teachers and students. The participants of the assembly enthusiastically supported the statement made by Soviet government leader Khrushchev in Paris. Professor Demin said at the meeting: How can we sit down and talk with those who declare military adventurism as a national policy?

Employees of the Soviet Southern Railway vehicle section held a mass meeting. The resolution passed at the meeting said that the shameless militarist actions and brazen statements of the American activists exposed the true face and beastly features of imperialism. Now, the whole world has seen who is hindering the easing of international tensions.

The Soviet civil aviation pilots of the "Tu-104" aircraft flying on international routes expressed great indignation at the U.S. Air Force's aggression against the Soviet Union. They unanimously supported the measures taken by the Soviet government to stop U.S. planes from intruding into Soviet airspace.

At the same time, Soviet newspapers continue to publish a large number of letters and articles from people from all walks of life. Academician Altobolevsky of the Soviet Academy of Sciences wrote in the "Moscow Truth" on the 21st that we scientists, like all Soviet citizens, unanimously support Comrade Khrushchev's statement in Paris. He pointed out that the responsibility for sabotaging the summit conference should be borne by those who adopt a robber policy towards the Soviet Union.

Bricklayer Sviridov said: Comrade Khrushchev did the right thing. When the United States and its president are still pursuing an unequal policy towards the Soviet Union, they must not participate in the Paris Summit.

An old technician from the Moscow "Dynamo" factory said that it can be seen that the American imperialists wanted to participate in the Paris Summit in this way: holding a bomb in one hand and signing peace documents with the other. The U.S. leaders must bear the full responsibility for the fact that the Paris Summit could not be held now.

Workers Vinitskas and Vilnius wrote that the workers in our factory unanimously believe that the Soviet government leader Khrushchev has taken a completely correct stance, which reflects the will of all the Soviet people.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st - Officers and soldiers of the Soviet Armed Forces have been holding rallies in recent days, strongly condemning the shameless provocative actions of U.S. imperialism. They unanimously stated: "If the imperialists dare to launch a war, send them to the grave!"

At a gathering of all officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Soviet Northern Army combat force, Lieutenant Morgunov said that now, every honest person in the world knows who wants peace and who wants war. American imperialists have completely exposed their beastly face and wolf-like greed. Soviet hero, Lieutenant Colonel Chukharev, said that we have ruthlessly hit the aggressors in the past, and we will ruthlessly hit them in the future.

At a gathering of officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Pacific Fleet, officer Zelekin said that the Soviet government leader exposed the U.S. ruling group, which sings "peace" on the surface but actually engages in dirty deeds. We, the officers and soldiers of the Pacific Fleet, along with all the Soviet people, warmly support Khrushchev's statement. Sergeant Yevsiv said that in order to counter the shameless provocations of the U.S. militarists, our naval officers and soldiers will redouble their vigilance and better master combat weapons.

At a gathering of officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Soviet Air Force, Major Beshkov pointed out that we will never allow others to impose their will on us. American imperialists should know that we are fully capable of defending our motherland, and we will use continued vigilance and improved combat skills to deal with the shameless provocations of the U.S. militarists.

Gatherings of Soviet officers and soldiers in various places also passed resolutions condemning the American aggressors. The resolutions unanimously stated that the Soviet army will more vigilantly watch the provocative actions of imperialism, and if they dare to disrupt the peaceful labor of the Soviet people, they will resolutely give a fatal blow.
