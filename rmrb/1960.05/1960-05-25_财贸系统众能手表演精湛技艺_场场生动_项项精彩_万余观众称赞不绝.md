Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd – More than 200 representatives attending the National Financial and Trade System Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Performance Conference gave a high-speed, high-skill, and high-quality business operation performance at the Great Hall of the People this afternoon.

Salespersons, warehouse keepers, purchasers, cooks, service personnel, clerks, cashiers, mimeograph operators, butchers, etc., from all over the country, performed "eight immortals crossing the sea, each displaying their unique abilities" in twenty-nine performances with approximately one hundred items. Truly, every scene was lively, every item wonderful. In today’s performances of commodity weighing, packaging, sorting, and inspection; vegetable cutting, dumpling wrapping, wonton wrapping, noodle stretching; cash counting, mental arithmetic, etc., the performers demonstrated superb skills. The movements of their hands, eyes, and brains were so fast and so precise. Some were even too fast to follow, and so precise that it was hard to believe. Today’s wonderful performance allowed over ten thousand spectators to witness that, under the shining light of the Party’s General Line for Socialist Construction, the working people of our country, while realizing mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, have also created high speed in manual operations.

Li Xiannian, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, Ma Mingfang, Minister of the Ministry of Finance and Trade of the CPC Central Committee, ministers of various departments in the financial and trade system, and responsible persons of relevant departments attended and watched today's performance. They and all the audience praised today's performance unceasingly.

Thirty-one bank cashiers demonstrated three new cash counting methods that raced against time with their fingertips. In "single-finger counting," banknotes flew past their fingers one after another; in "four-finger counting," banknotes surged like waves, four at a time; in "fan-shaped counting," one hundred banknotes opened like a fan and were counted with a single sweep. Before a match could be lit, the "fan" opened and closed four times. During the meat and vegetable cutting performances, the steel knives on the chefs’ cutting boards rose and fell, and piles of mutton slices, fish slices, and green vegetables were cut out. Bai Laokuan from Shanxi cut four catties of shredded cabbage in one minute and nine seconds, and He Fengqing from Beijing cut one catty of mutton slices in three minutes and six seconds. When wrapping dumplings, wontons, and buns, Liu Dairong, a thirteen-year-old girl (amateur worker), wrapped twenty-nine wontons in one minute. When Qiu Shaoqin, a mimeograph operator from Hebei Province, printed documents, the mimeograph roller spun rapidly, and the printed sheets poured out from her side. She printed one hundred and four sheets in one minute. When these printed sheets were taken to the audience below the stage, the Chinese and foreign languages printed on them were very clear. Each bicycle has thirty-eight main parts. Yuan Baojun, Zheng Shushan, and other six young men from Hebei, Beijing, Shaanxi, and Heilongjiang each assembled a bicycle in only five to nine minutes. When they rode the bicycles to the backstage after the performance, thunderous applause rang out from the audience.

Not only were the performers’ hands amazingly fast, but their brains were even more astonishingly quick. The four mental arithmetic performances were praised unceasingly by all the spectators. Lu Yinxing, a purchasing agent from Pingxiang, Jiangxi, performed three-digit addition and two-digit division of four-digit numbers today. The person giving the questions wrote an addition problem with as many as fifty numbers on paper, and after the audience checked it, handed it to Lu Yinxing. Lu took the question and kept reading the numbers in order, and when he finished reading the last number, he calculated the sum. After checking with written calculation, it was accurate without any mistakes. When Qin Jizhou, Ding Jianhua, and Ma Weiyuan performed three-digit and four-digit addition, multiplication, and division, each of them calculated the result as soon as the questioner finished reading the numbers, and all were accurate.

The representatives' operating skills were not only fast but also exquisite, and some had a fairly high artistic level. He Shuqing, an old worker from Sichuan, used two bamboos and a wooden frame to stretch one catty of hollow noodles in three minutes. This row of noodles floated like white silk, arousing applause from the audience. The skills of Zhou Zijie, a chef from Beijing, were even more ingenious. He used only a few minutes to stretch one catty of kneaded dough into more than sixteen thousand silver silk-like "dragon beard noodles." This kind of noodle has a special flavor after being fried. There were seven experts in rolling dumpling skins performing on the same stage. There were single-stick rolling of single skins, single-stick double-rolling of multiple skins, single-stick rolling of multiple skins, double-stick rolling of single skins, and also wonton skin beating. Shi Hongkun, an old chef from Shanghai, rolled the dough so thin that it was like a piece of paper. When placed on a newspaper, the words on the newspaper could be seen. There was also a clever girl who rolled six dumpling skins with both hands at the same time. Li Guoru, an old chef from Beijing Hotel, could carve more than thirty kinds of patterns from radishes and could carve a flower in a little over a minute. Today, he carved two flowers in two minutes and twenty-five seconds and also brought a pot of carved flowers for exhibition. There were dozens of kinds of flowers inside, such as Western lotus, September chrysanthemum, rose, monthly rose, etc., as well as lifelike butterflies and small grasshoppers, even the butterfly’s antennae and the grasshopper’s slender legs were carved. Li Guoru said that once a guest saw the green grasshopper he carved resting on a cauliflower and almost reached out to grab it. Xia Wenfu, a waiter at the Peace Hotel restaurant, can fold more than seventy kinds of birds and animals and various flowers with napkins. Today, he folded a peace dove on the spot, as if it were about to spread its wings and fly away. The programs performed at the meeting, such as boning, shaking cloth, measuring cloth, weighing packages, folding goods, and grasping vegetables and fruits accurately, were all wonderful manual operation skills.

Following the manual operation performances, a small factory suddenly appeared on the stage. This was a mechanized small bank. In this bank, counting machines, strapping machines, sealing machines, bagging machines, and handling machines rattled. The electric counting machine could count one hundred banknotes in just three seconds. The small conveyor created by Song Kechen of the grain processing plant after one hundred and eighty failures can raise and send far away without people carrying on their backs and shoulders, and can transport 50,000 catties per hour. While transporting grain, the quantity of grain is also recorded, and the accuracy exceeds that of a scale. The bag shaker performed by Chuan Lijia, a representative of the Xining Flour Factory in Qinghai Province, can shake clean one thousand and five hundred flour bags a day, increasing efficiency by thirty times compared to manual labor, and can also recover 35,000 catties of flour. The performance at the meeting showed that the mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation movement in the financial and trade system has not only achieved great results but is also in full swing and has broad development prospects.

    财贸系统众能手表演精湛技艺
    场场生动　项项精彩　万余观众称赞不绝
    新华社23日讯　出席全国财贸系统技术革新和技术革命表演大会的二百多位代表，今天下午在人民大会堂作了一次高速度、高技巧、高质量的业务操作表演。
    来自全国各地的商店售货员、仓库保管员、采购员、厨师、服务员、营业员、出纳员、油印员、屠宰员等，在二十九场、约百项操作表演中“八仙过海，各显神通”，真是场场生动，项项精彩，在今天表演的商品称量、包装、整理和检验，切菜、包饺子、包馄饨、抻面，点钞、心算等操作中，表演者们技术精湛，手、眼、脑的活动都是那样快，那样精确。有的甚至快得使你看不过来精确得使你难于相信。今天的精彩表演，使万余观众看到了在党的社会主义建设总路线光辉照耀下，我国劳动人民于实现机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的同时，在手工操作中也创造了高速度。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李先念、中共中央财贸部部长马明方、财贸系统的各部部长和有关部门的负责人出席观看了今天的表演。他们和所有观众对今天的表演都称赞不绝。
    三十一个银行出纳员表演了在手指尖上抢时间的三种新点钞法。在“单指点”时，只见钞票一张接一张地在他们手指上飞闪；“四指点”时，钞票四张接着四张地如浪翻滚；“扇面点”时，一百张钞票如扇面打开，一掠而毕。一根火柴还没有点完，“扇面”就开闭了四次。在表演切肉、切菜时，只见厨师们的案子上钢刀起伏，一堆一堆的涮羊肉片、鱼片和青菜就切了出来。山西白老宽用一分九秒钟切出白菜丝四斤，北京市何凤清用三分六秒钟切出了一斤涮羊肉。表演包饺子、包馄饨、包包子时，十三岁的小姑娘刘代蓉（业余工作者）一分钟就包了二十九个馄饨。河北省油印员丘绍琴印油印时，但见油印滚子飞转，印好的纸张从她手边倾泻而下。一分钟他就印了一百零四张。这些印好的纸当场拿到台下观众看时，上面印的中文和外文都十分清晰。每辆自行车有三十八个主要零件，来自河北、北京、陕西、黑龙江的营业员苑宝君、郑树山等六个小伙子，只用五分到九分钟就各自安装好一辆。当他们表演后骑上自行车转入后台时，台下响起了热烈的掌声。
    表演者不仅手快惊人，脑快更加惊人。四场心算表演，都使所有的观众称赞不绝。江西萍乡采购员吕引兴今天表演了三位数加法和两位数除四位数的除法。出题目者把长达五十个数字的加法题写在纸上，经过观众检验后，交给吕引兴。吕拿到题目不停地顺序往下念，当最后一个数字念完时，他也就把和数算出来了。经过与笔算核对，丝毫不错。秦继周、丁建华、马韦元三人表演三位、四位加法和乘法、除法时，每个人都是出题者刚刚把数字念完，就算出了结果，而且都是那样正确无误。
    代表们的操作技术不仅快，而且精巧，有些还具有相当高的艺术水平。四川老工人何树清用两根竹子，一个木架，三分钟就扯成一斤空心挂面。这一排挂面像白绸一样飘动，激起了全场掌声。北京厨师周子杰的手艺更巧。他只用几分钟就把一斤和好的面抻成一万六千多根银丝样的“龙须面”。这种面用油炸过以后，有特殊的风味。同台表演的擀饺子皮的能手有七个。有单杖擀单皮的，有单杖双擀多皮的，有单杖擀多皮的，有双杖擀单皮的，还有打馄饨皮的。上海的老厨师史洪坤擀的面皮薄得像一张纸，铺在报纸上，能看见报上的字。还有一位巧姑娘，两只手同时擀六个饺子皮。北京饭店的老厨师李国如能把萝?刻成三十多种花样，一分多钟就能刻成一朵花。今天他用二分二十五秒刻了两朵花，还带了一盆刻花前来展览，这里面有西香莲、九月菊、玫瑰、月季等几十种，还有栩栩如生的蝴蝶和小蝈蝈，连蝴蝶的须和蝈蝈的细腿都刻出来了。李国如说，有一次一位客人看见他刻的绿色小蝈蝈停在菜花上，几乎伸手去抓它。和平宾馆餐厅服务员夏文富，能用餐巾叠出七十多种飞禽走兽和各种花卉，今天他当场叠出了一个和平鸽，好像要展翅飞去一样。会上表演的剔骨、抖布、量布，秤包、折叠商品，菜果一抓准等节目都是精彩的手工操作技艺。
    继手工操作表演之后，舞台上突然出现了一个小小的工厂。这是一个实现了机械化的小银行。在这个银行里，点钞机，捆扎机、封包机、装麻袋机、搬运机轧轧作响。电动点钞机只要三秒钟就能数完一百张钞票。粮食加工厂的宋克臣经过一百八十次失败才创造成功的小小输送机，能够升高、送远，不用人背和肩扛，一小时能运送五万斤。在运送粮食的同时，粮食的数量也记载下来了，准确程度超过了磅秤。青海省西宁市面粉厂代表传立甲表演的抖袋机一天能抖净一千五百条面粉袋，比人工提高效率三十倍，还能回收面粉三万五千斤。会上的表演显示出，财贸系统的机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化运动不但获得巨大成绩，而且方兴未艾，有着远大的发展前途。
