    "We Are Japanese!"
    Qin Yunshu
    Before me is a poem. The title is: "We Are Japanese". The author is not a famous poet; no, he is not even a poet at all. He might be a fisherman, whose livelihood was taken away by the Kishida Nobusuke government's invitation of wolves into the house, ravaging the Japanese coast and countryside; he might be an elementary school teacher, who originally just wanted to be an honest and kind person, but the atrocities of the American invaders damaged his national self-esteem, and he could not remain silent; he might be… who knows who the author of this poem is? But, in any case, one thing is certain: he is a true Japanese, and his poem represents the voice of the Japanese people. Listen:
    What, we are Japanese,
    Definitely not the war-mongers' guinea pigs!
    "We are Japanese!" What a loud and resolute voice! The traitor Kishida Nobusuke sold out Japan's sovereignty, turning many fields into American barracks, turning many coasts into test sites for American military killing weapons. We seem to see scene after scene of desolation: people leaving their homes, taking their wives and children, leaving the fishing grounds and villages along the coast, selling the fishing nets and boats passed down through generations, and boarding small boats to make a living overseas. They bid farewell to their homeland with tears, bid farewell to their disaster-ridden motherland. However, the sea is vast, where can they go? What good fortune awaits them?
    Only those who have personally suffered from the disasters of war know what aggressive war will bring to people. Only they truly understand that peace is not begged for. We must struggle, struggle with those robbers who wield killing weapons, struggle with the war-mongers. Take the butcher knives out of their hands, throw away the atomic weapons in their hands. Thus, we see people gathering from all corners, like countless streams converging from all directions, trickling endlessly, finally becoming a roaring river. The author of the poem excitedly wrote:
    Where jet planes fly,
    Where tanks roll,
    From valley to forest,
    From small alley to factory area,
    Everywhere,
    The storm of anger is rising day by day,
    We are definitely not guinea pigs,
    We are Japanese!
    This poem, I imagine, was written in the struggle against atomic weapons testing. "We are definitely not guinea pigs, we are Japanese!" This voice is shouted louder and louder, and the ranks grow longer and longer.
    "We are Japanese!" Now, on the streets of Tokyo, it is this voice that resounds like spring thunder; from Hokkaido to Kagoshima, from the west coast of the Pacific to the east coast of the Sea of Japan, it is this voice that resounds like rolling waves. This voice represents an irrefutable truth. The people have always been the decisive factor in historical development. The Japanese people are the masters of Japan. It is not the Kishida Nobusuke clique that decides Japan's destiny, not the bloodthirsty militarists, not the reactionary groups that turn their hands into clouds and their hands into rain in the parliament, nor the American imperialists pulling the strings behind the scenes, but the eighty million people of Japan!
    This point, the reactionaries can never understand. Are they not rejoicing over the ugly farce of passing the new "Security Treaty" with bayonets? Perhaps, they are brewing some new conspiracy, thinking of some new tricks, to avoid the sharp edge of the people's struggle. They always think that: relying on bayonets and whips, even on planes, cannons and nuclear weapons, they can make thousands upon thousands of people obediently kneel under their boots, they can make history move forward according to their orders.
    However, the water flows through thousands of turns, and it will eventually flow into the sea. I also think of another poem by an anonymous Japanese poet (I think, its author may also be a fisherman). That poem is called "The Days of Gathering Seaweed Will Surely Come". The author of the poem is full of fighting optimism, he sings:
    The villagers,
    The days of gathering seaweed will surely come,
    As long as we actively carry out the struggle,
    The Japan of the Japanese will surely come!
    This is completely correct. You see, he is in a small fishing village, but he sees the bright and splendid future of the motherland. They are the representatives of the Japanese people, it is these Japanese people who proudly sing "We are Japanese" who will finally judge the fate of Kishida Nobusuke and other reactionaries.
    "The Japan of the Japanese will surely come." Yes, it will surely come!

### “我们是日本人！”

    “我们是日本人！”
    秦云树
    在我的面前，是一首诗。题目是：“我们是日本人”。作者并不是著名的诗人，不，甚至他根本不是诗人。他也许是一位渔民，由于岸信介政府引狼入室，蹂躏了日本的海岸和乡村，夺去了他的饭碗；他也许是一位小学教师，他原来只想当个正直的、善良的人，但是，美国侵略者的兽行损害了他的民族自尊心，他不能沉默；他也许是……谁知道这首诗的作者是谁呢？但是，无论如何，有一点可以肯定的，那就是：他是一个真正的日本人，他的诗，代表了日本人民的声音。你听：
    什么，我们是日本人，
    决不是战争贩子的试验品！
    “我们是日本人！”这是多么响亮、多么坚决的声音！卖国贼岸信介出卖了日本的主权，把多少田园变成美国兵营，把多少海岸变成美军杀人武器的试验场。我们仿佛看到一幅幅凄然的场景：人们背井离乡，挈妇将雏，离开了沿海岸的渔场和村落，卖掉了世代相传的渔网和渔船，乘上小船，到海外去谋生。他们含着泪，告别了故乡，告别了多灾多难的祖国。然而，大海茫茫，他们又能到哪儿去？等待他们的又有什么好运道？
    只有亲身受到战争灾害的人，才知道侵略战争会给人们带来什么。也只有他们，才真正懂得和平不是乞讨来的。必须斗争，同那些玩弄杀人武器的强盗们进行斗争，同战争贩子进行斗争。夺下他们手里的屠刀，扔掉他们手里的原子武器。于是，我们看到人们从各个角落里聚集起来了，像无数条小溪从四面八方汇集起来，涓涓不息，终于成为奔腾澎湃的大河。诗的作者激动地写道：
    在喷气式飞机飞行的地方，
    在坦克滚动的地方，
    从山谷到森林，
    从小胡同到工厂地区，
    所有的地方，
    愤怒的暴风雨正在日益高涨，
    我们决不是试验品，
    我们是日本人！
    这首诗，想来写于反对原子武器试验的斗争里。“我们决不是试验品，我们是日本人！”这声音却是越喊越响，队伍越来越长。
    “我们是日本人！”现在，在东京街头，像春雷般震响的，正是这个声音；从北海道到鹿儿岛，从太平洋西岸到日本海东岸，像滚滚浪涛震响着的，也是这个声音。这个声音代表了一条颠扑不破的真理。人民，从来就是历史发展的决定性因素。日本人民，是日本的主人。决定日本命运的，不是岸信介集团，不是嗜血成性的军国主义者，不是反动集团翻手为云复为雨的国会，也不是在幕后提线的美帝国主义者，而是日本的八千万人民！
    这一点，反动派是永远不能理解的。他们不是正在为那出用刺刀通过新“安全条约”的丑剧在高兴么？也许，他们在酝酿着什么新的阴谋，想什么新的花招，来躲避人民斗争的锋芒。他们总以为：靠刺刀和皮鞭，甚至靠飞机大炮核武器，就能叫千千万万人民服服贴贴地跪在自己的皮靴下，就能叫历史按他们的命令往前走。
    然而，水流千转，总归是要流进大海的。我又想起另一首日本无名诗人的诗（我想，它的作者可能也是一位渔民）。那首诗叫“捞海带的日子一定会到来”。诗的作者充满了战斗的乐观精神，他唱着：
    村子里的老百姓啊，
    捞海带的日子一定会到来，
    只要咱们积极地展开斗争，
    日本人的日本一定会到来！
    这是完全对的。你看，他在一个小渔村里，却看到了祖国光明灿烂的未来。他们是日本人民的代表，正是这些自豪地高唱着“我们是日本人”的日本人民，将要最后判决岸信介和别的反动派们的命运。
    “日本人的日本一定会到来”。是的，一定会到来！
