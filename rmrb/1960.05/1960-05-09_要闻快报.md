Shanxi Vigorously Promotes Irrigation in Mountainous Areas

In its drought resistance campaign, Shanxi Province is vigorously promoting irrigation in mountainous areas. According to recent statistics, the 517 completed high-lift irrigation projects across the province have transformed nearly 4 million mu of dry highland, previously un-irrigated land, into irrigated fields. In Pingyao County, under the leadership of Party secretaries at all levels, a force of 20,000 people was organized in the hilly areas, combining the creation of high-yield plots, ridges, and ditches, constructing 15 winding mountain canals, tunneling through five mountain caves, and crossing 18 ditch walls to reverse the flow of water and bring it up the mountains.

While fully utilizing the capacity of irrigation and drainage machinery, various regions are also vigorously carrying out activities to innovate machinery. Taigu County has manufactured a power-operated pneumatic water pump suitable for high-altitude irrigation, with a pumping efficiency one and a half times higher than ordinary power-operated waterwheels.

Guizhou Rushes to Produce Summer Harvest Tools

People's communes in Guizhou Province are rushing to produce summer harvest tools and transportation equipment. By mid-April, more than 170,000 new-style threshing and harvesting tools had been manufactured, and over 980,000 units (pieces) of transportation tools such as ox carts and horse carts had been prepared. Wooden rail tracks have been erected at many high-yield dams.

In the rush to produce summer harvest tools, various regions are vigorously promoting technological innovation and revolution, resulting in a wide variety of highly efficient summer harvest tools. The foot-operated wheat, rapeseed threshing, harvesting, shelling, and grain-separating combined machine manufactured by the Jinping County Machinery Factory can complete the entire process of wheat or rapeseed from threshing, shelling, sieving, and cleaning in one go. It is multi-functional and has an efficiency about eight times higher than manual labor, with a low cost of only 30 yuan per unit.

Zhejiang Focuses on Early Rice Management

Zhejiang Province has completed the transplanting of over 12 million mu of the first batch of early rice before "立夏" (Lixia, the Beginning of Summer). Currently, commune members in various regions are focusing on early rice management, comprehensively organizing cadres and the masses to conduct field inspections. Communes and production teams are also re-arranging labor and organizing various specialized teams based on the needs of seedling replanting, weeding, and fertilization. Cui Yuxian, First Secretary of the Jinyun County Party Committee, after inspecting the Xilong Production Brigade of the Panxi Commune, discovered that the paddy fields were lacking seedlings and the weeding quality was not good enough. He immediately worked with cadres and commune members to set high standards for paddy field management and implemented specialized management for the entire team's land.

Yunnan's Sheep Farming Industry Develops Rapidly

Yunnan Province's sheep farming industry is developing rapidly. The net increase in sheep and goats in the province in four months is more than twice the total increase for the entire previous year.

About 90% of Yunnan's land has not yet been cultivated, with natural pastures everywhere. The climate is mild and suitable for grazing all year round. Sheep manure is a high-quality fertilizer containing the most nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Developing sheep farming is of great significance for increasing crop yields.

Nearly 100,000 laborers in Yunnan Province are engaged in full-time sheep farming.

Heilongjiang Province Rushes to Plant Flax and Sugar Beet

While ensuring the sowing of food crops, Heilongjiang Province is vigorously planting flax and sugar beet. Currently, the flax sowing has basically ended throughout the province, with a total planting area of more than 800,000 mu, an increase of more than 7% over last year. The sugar beet sowing is continuing, with more than 600,000 mu already planted. In the sowing process, various regions have universally implemented rational close planting in accordance with the requirements of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Most counties have changed from the past 15-centimeter row sowing and cross sowing of flax to 7.5-centimeter row sowing and cross sowing, greatly increasing the density of planting. Sugar beet has also been changed from large ridges to small ridges.

More Than One Million People in Shantou Prefecture Fight Floods

Since May 4th, Guangdong's Shantou Prefecture has been hit by sudden rainstorms. In the Chaoshan Plain, the daily rainfall in various counties generally reached more than 400 millimeters, with individual areas reaching as much as 800 millimeters. Due to the heavy rainfall, mountain torrents quickly broke out, and the water levels in various rivers and water storage projects suddenly rose sharply. Low-lying areas experienced internal flooding, and some villages were even temporarily surrounded by floods. In order to overcome the floods and internal flooding and ensure the safety of the people's lives and property and crops, the Shantou Prefectural Party Committee, the county Party committees, and the commune Party committees, as well as cadres at all levels, immediately rushed to the front lines of flood fighting, leading more than one million flood fighters to launch a battle against floods and drainage. At present, the water is being rapidly drained from the flood-affected areas.

    要闻快报
    山西大搞高山地区浇灌运动
    山西省在抗旱运动中，大搞高山地区的浇灌运动。到最近统计，全省已完成的五百一十七处提水高灌工程，已使将近四百万亩从未灌溉过的高垣旱地变成了水浇地。平遥县在各级党委书记领导下，组织两万大军，在丘陵区结合大搞丰产方、梁、沟，建成十五条盘山渠，穿通五个山洞、越过十八道沟壁，逼水倒流，引水上山。
    各地在充分发挥排灌机械能力的同时，大力开展革新机具的活动。太谷县制成一种适于高地灌溉的动力气压抽水机，抽水效率比一般动力水车高一倍半。
    贵州赶制夏收工具
    贵州省各地人民公社正在赶制夏收工具和运藏设备。到4月中旬止，已制出新式脱粒、收割工具十七万多件，准备了牛车、马车等运输工具九十八万多部（件），许多丰产坝架设了木轨车道。
    在赶制夏收工具中，各地大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，出现了多种多样高工效的夏收工具。锦屏县机械厂制造的脚踏式小麦、油菜脱粒、收割、剥壳、筛粒联合机，能将小麦或油菜从脱粒、剥壳、过筛、风净一气呵成，一机多能，工效比人工提高八倍左右，造价低廉，每部只需三十元。
    浙江大抓早稻管理
    浙江省一千二百多万亩首批早稻已在“立夏”前全部插完。现在各地公社社员正在大抓早稻管理，全面组织干部、群众进行田间大检查。各公社和生产队并根据补苗、耘田、施肥的需要，重新安排劳力，组织各种专业队伍。缙云县委第一书记崔于贤同志到盘溪公社西龙生产大队检查后，发现稻田缺秧，耘田质量不够好，立即和干部、社员共同订出了稻田管理的高标准，并将全队的土地进行规划，实行专人管理。
    云南养羊事业发展迅速
    云南省养羊事业发展迅速。全省四个月中净增山、绵羊比去年全年增长总数多两倍多。
    云南有90％左右土地尚未开垦，到处是天然牧场，气候温和，四季宜牧。羊粪是含氮磷钾最多的优质肥料，发展养羊对农作物增产具有重大意义。
    云南全省专职养羊的劳力有近十万人。
    黑龙江省抢种亚麻和甜菜
    黑龙江省在保证粮食作物播种的同时，大力种植亚麻和甜菜。现在，全省亚麻播种已经基本结束，种植面积共达八十万多亩，比去年扩大百分之七以上。甜菜播种工作正在继续进行，现在已种六十多万亩。各地在播种中普遍按照农业“八字宪法”的要求，推行了合理密植。大部分县的亚麻，从过去十五厘米的条播和交叉播种，改为七点五厘米的条播和交叉播种，大大提高了密植幅度。甜菜也由过去的大垅改为小垅。
    汕头专区一百多万人和洪涝搏斗
    广东汕头专区从5月4日起，暴雨突然袭来。潮汕平原各县一天内降雨普遍达四百毫米以上，个别地区竟达八百毫米之多。由于暴雨下得猛，山洪很快暴发，各江河和蓄水工程水位突然猛涨，低洼地区发生内涝，有些村庄甚至一时被洪水所围困。为了战胜洪水和内涝，确保人民生命财产和农作物的安全，中共汕头地委、各县县委和公社党委以及各级干部，立即奔向抗洪最前线，率领一百多万抗洪大军展开抗洪排涝战斗。目前因雨成涝的地区，积水正在迅速排除。
