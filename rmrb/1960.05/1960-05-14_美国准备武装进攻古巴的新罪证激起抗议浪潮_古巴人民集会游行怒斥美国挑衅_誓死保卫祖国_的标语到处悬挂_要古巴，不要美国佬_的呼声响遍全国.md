Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Cuba is seething with anger across the nation, with mass rallies and demonstrations held one after another to protest the new provocations of US imperialism in preparing for an armed invasion of Cuba.

On May 11th, the Cuban newspaper "Revolución" dedicated its entire front page to condemning the US preparations for aggression against Cuba. The newspaper published a notice signed by the US Ambassador to Cuba, Bonsal, as one piece of evidence. The notice signed by Bonsal stated, "Notice: This building or site is the property of or occupied by the following American persons or entities. Notice is also given that the aforementioned building or site is under the protection of the United States Embassy. All persons maintaining order and those conditionally offering assistance are requested to assist in protecting this property."

The evidence of US imperialism's preparations for an armed invasion of Cuba revealed by "Revolución" has ignited national outrage, and people across the country are mobilizing to defend their homeland.

On the evening of May 11th, Havana held a mass rally of 50,000 people under the slogans "Swear to Defend the Motherland" and "Cuba Yes, Yankees No," protesting the US preparations for aggression. The rally was convened by the Cuban Workers' Confederation and the University Students Federation.

Jesús Soto, organizing secretary of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, condemned in his speech at the rally that the notice printed by the US Embassy proved that "US imperialism is preparing to launch an armed invasion of our country," which is "provocative interference." He said, "In the face of threats and aggression, we must fulfill Martí's legacy: to unite as one."

Large-scale marches and mass rallies were also held in Santiago, Camagüey, Santa Clara, Matanzas, and other cities, with workers, students, farmers, and other people expressing their firm determination to oppose the US imperialist aggressors.

Spokespersons for the "26th of July Movement," the Revolutionary Directorate, the Popular Socialist Party, the Cuban Workers' Confederation, the Rebel Army, and student and peasant organizations unanimously emphasized their determination to fight in unity. The Cuban University Students Federation issued a statement saying that such notices are only used in the event of war, "which shows that the United States has planned a direct armed invasion of the Cuban people." The statement condemned the above-mentioned notice for not requesting the protection of the Cuban authorities, but rather requesting that those conditionally providing assistance help protect the property, "which is extremely brazen and blatant aggression." The statement pointed out that the US "military exercises conducted by the Navy in Puerto Rico, the storage of large quantities of armaments in Caimanera (one of the US naval bases in Cuba), and the secret production of these notices signed by the US Ambassador, in order to post them on buildings or sites in which the US government is interested in placing under its protection, all prove that the imperialist conspiracy to slaughter our people has been completed."

Workers at the US Guantanamo Naval Base stated, "We oppose the attempts of US imperialism to infringe upon our sovereignty, and our answer is to swear to defend the motherland." The Cuban Women's Support for Latin American Liberation Conference emphasized, "If necessary, we will defend our territory with blood and fire."

Slogans defending the motherland are hung on houses in Havana and many other cities. Thousands of Havana families have hung slogans in front of their doors with the Cuban flag and the oath "Swear to Defend the Motherland," which read: "This is a Cuban house, and it is under the protection of the glorious Rebel Army and the Cuban Revolution." This is a response to the blatant and shameless notice of the US Embassy in Cuba. In Matanzas, people saw slogans such as: "This house is Cuban territory, and we residents will defend it against any encroachment by mercenaries. Our aim is to defend national sovereignty without giving an inch."

Patriotic slogans are flashing everywhere on the streets of Havana, on the walls of houses, and on moving cars. Angry demonstrators marched past the US Embassy in batches. Militia demonstrations and protest rallies were held in many places.

    美国准备武装进攻古巴的新罪证激起抗议浪潮
    古巴人民集会游行怒斥美国挑衅
    “誓死保卫祖国”的标语到处悬挂　“要古巴，不要美国佬”的呼声响遍全国
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：古巴全国各地群情激愤，纷纷举行群众大会和示威游行，抗议美帝国主义准备武装进攻古巴的新挑衅。
    古巴“革命报”11日以第一版整版篇幅谴责美国已准备好了对古巴的侵略。这家报纸发表了美国驻古巴大使邦沙尔签署的一个告示作为证据之一。邦沙尔签署的这个告示说，“通告：这幢建筑物或地盘是下列美国人或单位的财产或为它们占有。同时通知，上述的建筑物或地盘是在美国大使馆的保护之下的。要求一切维持秩序的人和有条件进行帮助的人协助保护这项产业。”
    “革命报”揭露的关于美帝国主义准备武装进攻古巴的证据使全国群情激愤，各地人民正在动员起来，准备保卫祖国。
     11日晚上哈瓦那在“誓死保卫祖国”，“要古巴，不要美国佬”的口号下举行了有五万人参加的群众大会，抗议美国的侵略准备。这次大会是由古巴工人联合会和大学生联合会召集的。
    古巴工人联合会组织书记赫苏斯·索托在大会发言中谴责美国大使馆印刷的告示证明“美帝国主义准备对我们的祖国发动一次武装侵略”，这是“挑衅性的干涉”。他说，“在威胁和侵略的面前，我们要履行马蒂的遗训：团结一致。”
    在圣地亚哥、卡马圭、圣克拉拉、马坦萨斯和其他城市也举行了声势浩大的游行和群众大会，工人、学生、农民和其他人民阶层表示了坚决反对美帝国主义侵略者的决心。
   “7月26日运动”、革命指导委员会、人民社会党、古巴工人联合会、起义军以及学生和农民组织的发言人一致强调团结战斗的决心。古巴大学生联合会就此发表声明说，这种告示只有在发生战争的情况下才使用，“这表明美国已经策划好了对古巴人民的直接武装进攻”。声明谴责上述告示不要求古巴当局的保护，而要求有条件进行帮助的人协助保护这项财产，“这是非常无耻和明目张胆的侵略”。声明指出，美国“海军在波多黎各进行的军事演习，在卡伊马内拉（美国在古巴的海军基地之一）贮存大量军备，暗地里悄悄制作由美国大使签署的这些告示，以便把这些告示张贴在美国政府有兴趣放在自己保护下面的建筑物或地盘上去，这一切证明，帝国主义为屠杀我国人民进行准备的阴谋活动业已完成”。
    美国关塔那摩海军基地的工人表示，“我们反对美帝国主义侵犯我们主权的企图，我们的回答是誓死保卫祖国”。古巴妇女支援拉丁美洲解放大会强调说，“如果需要的话，我们将用鲜血和火保卫领土。”
    在哈瓦那和其他许多城市的房屋上悬挂着保卫祖国的标语。数以千计的哈瓦那人家门前都悬挂着带有古巴国旗和“誓死保卫祖国”的誓言的标语，上面写着：“这是古巴人的房屋，它是在古巴人民光荣的起义军及古巴革命的保护下”。这是对美国驻古巴大使馆明目张胆的无耻的告示的回答。在马坦萨斯，人们看到这样的标语：“这所房子是古巴的领土，我们居民将保卫它，反对任何雇佣者的侵犯。我们的目的是分毫不让地保卫民族主权”。
    在哈瓦那大街上、房屋墙壁上和行驶的汽车上到处都闪耀着爱国主义的标语。愤怒的示威群众一批批地从美国大使馆门前穿过。许多地方都举行了民兵示威游行和抗议集会。
