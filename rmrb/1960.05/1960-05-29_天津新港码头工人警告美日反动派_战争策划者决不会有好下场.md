Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 27th. People from all walks of life in Tianjin continue to hold rallies and demonstrations to support the Japanese people's just struggle to overthrow the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and oppose the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy to plot a new war. Eight thousand dockworkers at Tianjin New Port expressed their extreme anger at the heinous actions of the Nobusuke Kishi traitorous clique in Japan, who used fascist violence to forcibly "pass" the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty in the House of Representatives. At noon on the 24th, the dockworkers held a demonstration along the long embankment. During the Japanese fascist invasion of China, the New Port dockworkers fought bravely against the Japanese aggressors, and many were brutally persecuted by the Japanese fascists. Qian Chun, a well-known model worker and veteran worker, suffered a disability in his waist due to the inhumane slave labor imposed by the Japanese imperialists during their invasion of China. He said that the Japanese fascist invasion of China not only brought profound disasters to the Chinese people, but also brought much suffering to the Japanese people. We deeply sympathize with the plight of the Japanese people and firmly support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' plot for a new war. Veteran worker Qiu Yudong said excitedly that the Chinese people love peace, but they are not afraid of war. The Chinese people fully understand how to deal with aggressors. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' plot for a new war will come to no good end. Twenty years ago, this veteran worker united the port workers to beat up the Japanese fascist elements who enslaved them. The Japanese fascist military police arrested him seven times and subjected him to much torture, but they never shook his firm will to oppose Japanese fascism.

On the 24th, the crew members of the Shanghai Peace No. 57 freighter docked at the New Port also joined the demonstration together with the dockworkers, led by Captain Li Shaowen and Political Commissar Zhu Dong.

The more than 39,000 members of the Xing'an Road People's Commune have held rallies and demonstrations in recent days to support the just struggle of the Japanese people. On the 21st, the commune also held a mass meeting, severely condemning the Nobusuke Kishi clique's crime of using force to compel the Japanese House of Representatives to pass the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. Liu Guijin, a 54-year-old commune member, whose husband, Zhou Guangyuan, was taken away by the Japanese fascists seventeen years ago and has not been heard from since, said at the meeting: "The military alliance treaty signed by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs is a war threat to China, the Soviet Union, and all Asian countries. We firmly support the just struggle of the Japanese people against this aggressive treaty and will never allow the people of all countries and the Japanese people to suffer the disasters of Japanese militarism again." The congress also passed a resolution opposing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and firmly supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people. All members of the commune signed the resolution. Teachers and students of Nankai University in Tianjin have also held rallies in the past few days.

    天津新港码头工人警告美日反动派
    战争策划者决不会有好下场
    据新华社天津27日电　天津各界人民继续举行集会和示威，支持日本人民推翻日美军事同盟条约、反对美日反动派策划新战争阴谋的正义斗争。天津新港的八千名码头工人对日本岸信介卖国集团施用法西斯暴力，在国会众议院强行“通过”日美军事同盟条约的罪恶活动表示极大愤怒。24日中午，码头工人们沿着长长的堤岸举行了示威游行。在日本法西斯侵略中国期间，新港的码头工人曾经同日本侵略者进行了英勇的斗争，许多人受到了日本法西斯的残酷迫害。著名劳动模范、老工人钱春，在日本帝国主义侵华期间，曾因为日本法西斯非人道的奴役劳动，使腰部留下了残疾。他说，日本法西斯侵略中国不仅给中国人民带来了深重的灾难，而且也同样给日本人民带来了许多苦难，我们深深同情日本人民的处境，坚决支持日本人民反对日美反动派策划新战争的爱国正义斗争。老工人仇玉栋激动地说，中国人民热爱和平，但是决不害怕战争。中国人民完全懂得怎样来对付侵略者，美日反动派策划新的战争，是决不会有好下场的。这个老工人二十年前曾团结港口工人痛打过奴役他们的日本法西斯分子，日本法西斯宪兵队曾逮捕他七次，使他受了许多折磨，但是都没有动摇过他反对日本法西斯的坚强意志。
    24日停泊在新港码头的上海和平五十七号货轮上的船员们在船长李绍文和政委朱栋率领下也和码头工人一起参加了示威。
    兴安路人民公社的三万九千多名社员连日来举行了支持日本人民正义斗争的集会和示威游行。21日，这个公社又举行了群众大会，严厉谴责岸信介集团用武力强迫日本众议院通过日美军事同盟条约的罪行。五十四岁的社员刘桂金的丈夫周广元，十七年前被日本法西斯抓走后至今没有音讯。她在会上说：“美帝国主义和它的走狗签订的军事同盟条约，是对中国、苏联和所有亚洲国家的战争威胁。我们坚决支持日本人民反对这一侵略性条约的正义斗争，决不让各国人民和日本人民再遭受日本军国主义的灾害。”大会还通过了反对日美军事同盟条约、坚决支持日本人民正义斗争的决议，全体社员都在决议上签了名。天津南开大学的师生们这几天也纷纷举行了集会。
