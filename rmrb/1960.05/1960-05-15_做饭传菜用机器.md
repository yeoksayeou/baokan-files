After the Party branch of the Changchun Restaurant proposed to all employees the call to use machines to cook meals, it was like a spring breeze blooming everywhere. In just three months, they created and imitated 24 innovative tools, realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of processes such as steaming and boiling food, food and dish delivery, furniture retrieval, rice washing, and dough mixing. Labor efficiency increased dozens of times. The steamed buns made with the electric steamed bun machine are soft and delicious, comparable to handmade steamed buns, but the efficiency is seven times higher than handmade. Using the rice washing machine, just put the rice into the rice storage box, and the rice will be automatically sent to the rice washing machine for automatic washing. It washes 1,000 jin of rice per hour and can remove all the sand and chaff.

The Changchun Restaurant receives tens of thousands of customers every day, and delivering food and dishes and retrieving furniture consumes the most labor and is very labor-intensive. With the circulating food delivery machine, the dishes can be sent from the kitchen to the business hall, turning corners and passing through walls.

After realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization, the Changchun Restaurant is developing towards automation and continuous production. Now three restaurants have established continuous production and sales lines. Customers choose their menus and use a microphone to tell the waiter at the electric control station. The waiter dials the number, and the chef will cook the food according to the number, and the food delivery machine will automatically deliver it to the customer's table. There is a special table that rotates slowly once per minute, allowing customers to eat all the dishes without leaving their seats.

In the breakfast restaurant, we can also see another scene. There are three continuous production lines in the restaurant for slurry, sesame cakes, and fried dough sticks, from feeding to food production, all in continuous production. Customers put coins into the automatic dispenser at the prescribed price, and they can get the things they want. If the wrong amount of money is inserted, the machine will automatically return it.

    做饭传菜用机器
    长春饭店的党支部向全体职工提出用机器做菜饭的号召以后，犹如一夜春风花满枝，仅仅三个月，就创造和仿制了二十四项革新工具，使蒸煮食品、饭菜传送、取送家具、淘米、合面等工序实现了机械化、半机械化。劳动效率提高几十倍。用电动花卷机做的花卷，吃起来柔软可口，很可以和手工做的花卷媲美，效率却比手工做花卷提高七倍。用淘米机淘米，只要把米放到贮米箱里，米就自动送进淘米机自动淘洗。一小时淘米一千斤，而且可把沙子、糠秕全部清除。
    长春饭店每天要接待上万名顾客，传送饭菜、送取家具，占用劳动力最多，而且劳动强度很高。有了循回运菜机，菜就可以拐弯抹角、串墙越壁地从厨房送到营业室。
    长春饭店实现机械化、半机械化以后，又向自动化、连续化方向发展。现在已有三个餐厅建立了生产、产销连续线。顾客选好菜谱，用传话筒告诉电动操纵台的服务员。服务员拨动一下号码，厨师就会按号做好饭菜，由送菜机自动送到顾客的餐桌上。有种特制的餐桌每分钟徐缓转动一周，顾客不离位子，就可以吃到全桌菜。
    在早点餐厅，我们还可以看到另一种景象。餐厅里有浆汁、烧饼、油条三条生产连续线，由投料到出食品全部是连续生产。顾客按规定价格把硬币投进自动付货器里，就可如数的得到要买的东西。如果钱投错了，机器还自动退出来。　（刘农、胥志成）
