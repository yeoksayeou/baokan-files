    Beijing Urban Communes and Street Factories Carry Out Technical Education
    Vast Numbers of Women Rapidly Master Production Skills
    Zhuzhou Tianxin Commune Adheres to Serving Large Factories, All Undertakings Advance Greatly
    (Our Dispatch) Our reporter Sun Shikui reports: Factories and street factories run by the Beijing urban people's communes have adopted methods such as linking up with large factories, running their own technical classes, and combining with the technical innovation and technical revolution movements to widely conduct technical education, enabling the vast numbers of housewives who have taken up production posts to master production skills as quickly as possible.
    Conducting technical education in commune-run industry and street industry is a new topic. Under the leadership of the street Party committees, the commune-run factories and street factories in Beijing, based on the characteristics of commune-run industry and street industry starting from scratch, having simple equipment, focusing on processing, and having weak technical forces, conduct flexible and diverse technical education in combination with production, adapting to the urgent need of housewives to learn production skills after participating in production.
    After the commune-run factories and street factories are linked with large factories, they adopt two methods, "sending out to learn" and "inviting in to teach," to conduct technical education for production personnel, with great results. Over the past year, the Fusui Jing People's Commune Paper Mill has selected eighteen apprentices to "study abroad" at Beijing Yanjing Paper Mill No. 1 and other units, with each study period lasting one to four months. After returning to the factory after studying, they adopted the method of skilled workers leading unskilled workers and fast hands helping slow hands to pass on the technology they learned from the large factories to more people. In this factory, housewives who didn't understand how papermaking worked a year ago have now initially mastered papermaking technology, and eight of them have become skilled workers who can lead shifts independently. Eight factories, including the Beixinqiao People's Commune Shoe Factory, invited twenty-eight technical workers from large factories. After arriving at the commune factories, they not only guided production but also trained production personnel, teaching while doing work. The Chunshu Commune Glass Instrument Factory successively invited three technicians from the Xuanwu Glass Factory. They operated and explained during production, and the production personnel generally felt that they gained a lot. Among the fifty-plus women who were burning glass instruments, twenty-eight have mastered the production technology in the past year and can produce more than one hundred kinds of laboratory instruments. The quality and quantity of their flat-bottom tubes, test tubes, and other products have generally caught up with the level of state-owned factories.
    Many commune-run factories and street factories run their own technical classes, turning the workshop into a classroom, lecturing and then experimenting, and then producing. The Beixinqiao Commune Chemical Factory has been holding technical classes once a week in its spare time since March 1959. They teach what they produce, and the production personnel are very enthusiastic about learning. When they produce dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, they talk about chemical molecular formulas, etc., and then they practice on the spot after the lecture. The production personnel feel that this kind of learning is easy to understand and remember. Zhang Lanying, a production worker at this factory, originally had only elementary school education. After a year of technical classes and actual production, she has mastered the technology of manufacturing seven kinds of chemical drugs such as dipotassium hydrogen phosphate and ferrous sulfate. She understands general basic chemical knowledge and also proposed the suggestion of extracting phosphoric acid from bones, which has also been successful after testing. While launching technical education, the Dashilan Commune Glass Instrument Factory also opened cultural classes, teaching elementary school and junior high school courses respectively, improving the cultural level of production personnel and laying a good foundation for technical education.
    Many commune-run factories and street factories also select production experts and list them as pacesetters, serving as "little teachers," and launch mass movements of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping in the whole factory. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the Donghuamen Commune Metal Craft Processing Factory launched technical performance competitions in units of groups. First, fast hands and veterans performed operations, and slow hands and novices watched. Then, slow hands and novices performed, and veterans and fast hands guided. They spread production technology by performing, explaining, guiding, and summarizing at the same time. Twenty-five slow hands and novices in the two workshops quickly learned many production technologies in the technical performance competition. The average daily output per person increased by 12%, and the quality of products also improved greatly.
    Under the leadership of the commune Party committees, many commune-run factories and street factories, aiming at the inferiority and fear of difficulties that housewives have after participating in production, combine technical education with political and ideological work. He Shuzhen of the Xinjiekou Hardware Factory had feelings of inferiority and fear of difficulties when she first entered the factory and saw the machines. She felt that she was a housewife, uneducated, and learning production technology was like a toad wanting to eat swan meat. Later, with the help of the factory leadership, she liberated her mind, studied diligently, and quickly mastered the technology of making colanders and other things, and also proposed some technical innovation projects. Now she says excitedly: "The 'swan meat' is getting tastier and tastier."
    (Our Dispatch) The Tianxin People's Commune in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, which is centered on the Zhuzhou Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, adheres to the policy of serving large factories, and various undertakings have greatly developed.
    After the establishment of the Tianxin People's Commune, it prominently grasped the central link of serving large factories to organize production, and successively mobilized more than 1,000 housewives and idle labor forces to run many satellite factories and transportation, service, and other undertakings around the production needs of the Zhuzhou Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant. In the past year or so, these satellite factories have produced nearly 10,000 tons of cement, dolomite, water glass, calcium carbide, coke, and lime; the loading and unloading team composed of family members of employees has loaded and unloaded more than 60,000 tons of materials for the Rolling Stock Plant since the establishment of the commune in 1958. The commune members also built a steel casting workshop with an area of more than 20,000 square meters for the Rolling Stock Plant, and built 15 kilometers of highways and railways. After the housewives participated in production, the Rolling Stock Plant no longer needed to absorb many new workers from other places, saving more than 360,000 yuan in the cost of building dormitories alone.
    The various production units run by the commune all use various scraps from large factories as the main raw materials. Among the more than 500 kinds of products of these production units, there are more than 200 kinds of products that serve large factories, more than 100 kinds of products that serve the basic construction of large factories, and more than 50 kinds of products that serve agricultural production, and more than 100 kinds of products that serve the people's livelihood. A commune-run machinery factory that has developed from a steelmaking group into a factory with more than 200 workers and more than 40 pieces of machinery and equipment can produce 4,000 kinds of products for the Rolling Stock Plant, such as freight car hooks, chain hinges, yarn-wrapped wires, drawer covers, files, and die wrenches. In the past year, this factory has produced a total of 390 tons of castings for passenger and freight cars and more than 150,000 various parts for the Rolling Stock Plant. Recently, it has also produced more precise products such as lead seal pliers in batches, and the monthly output value has increased from several hundred yuan at the beginning to 150,000 yuan now. From its establishment to March of this year, the total output value of the commune industry has reached more than 1.36 million yuan.
    According to the policy of focusing on vegetables and meat, the Tianxin Commune has vigorously developed agricultural production in the past year. Now, the commune's vegetable sowing area has reached more than 500 mu, which is ten times larger than before the establishment of the commune; the number of live pigs has increased from the original 400 to 1,500; the fish farming area has reached 120 mu; and the number of poultry has doubled compared with 1958. The commune also organized industry to vigorously support agriculture. Last year, with the support of industry, the commune's agricultural brigade basically realized the self-flowing irrigation and the motorization of transportation, and some canteens and residents had electric lights, and the fertilizer was also greatly increased, thus achieving a bumper harvest, and the income of commune members also increased greatly.
    The Tianxin Commune has more than 20,000 members. In the past year or so, due to the development of production and the establishment of many collective welfare undertakings, commune members with labor capacity have basically participated in production or work. The whole commune has run 35 canteens, and more than 14,000 people have participated in eating in the canteens. Due to the in-depth mobilization of the masses, the adoption of self-reliance, adapting to local conditions, and small and diverse methods, and the implementation of the principles of running them actively and participating voluntarily, the canteens have developed particularly rapidly. In addition, two kindergartens and twenty-two nurseries (stations) have been established, accommodating a total of 1,500 children. Eight service stations and one hundred and five service teams were also organized to form a life service network.
    Due to the rapid development of production, the living standards of commune members have also improved accordingly. The cultural life of the masses is also more colorful than in the past. The commune has a club, reading room, radio station, and regularly or irregularly screens movies. It has also established a cultural school and newly established a primary school.
    After the establishment of the commune, commune members have had more opportunities to receive political and cultural education, and the spiritual outlook of the people and the relationship between people have also undergone profound changes. It has become a common practice among housewives to compare ideological progress, labor, learning, thrift, and unity and mutual assistance. The vast majority of housewives have mastered various production skills after the establishment of the commune, and some have reached the level of third-level technicians. In 1959 alone, 531 housewives were rated as advanced producers.

    北京城市公社和街道工厂开展技术教育
    广大妇女迅速掌握生产本领
    株洲田心公社坚持为大工厂服务各项事业大步前进
    本报讯　记者孙世恺报道：北京城市人民公社兴办的工厂和街道工厂，采取同大工厂挂钩、自办技术课、结合技术革新和技术革命运动等办法，广泛进行技术教育，使走上生产岗位的广大家庭妇女，尽快地掌握了生产本领。
    在社办工业和街道工业中进行技术教育是个新的课题。北京的社办工厂和街道工厂在街道党委领导下，根据社办工业和街道工业白手起家、设备简单、加工为主和技术力量薄弱等特点，结合生产进行灵活多样的技术教育，适应了家庭妇女参加生产后迫切需要学会生产本领的要求。
    社办工厂和街道工厂和大工厂挂钩后，采取“派出去学”和“请进来教”两种办法，对生产人员进行技术教育，收效很大。福绥境人民公社造纸厂一年来选拔十八名徒工送到北京燕京造纸一厂等单位去“留学”，每次学习时间一至四个月。学完回厂，又采取熟手带生手、快手帮慢手的办法，把自己从大厂学来的技术传授给更多的人。在这个工厂里，一年前根本不懂造纸是怎么回事的家庭妇女，现在已初步掌握了造纸技术，其中有八个妇女变成了熟手，能够单独领班开车。北新桥人民公社制鞋厂等八个工厂从大工厂请来二十八名技术工人，到公社工厂后，既指导生产，又培训生产人员，边干活边教学。椿树公社玻璃仪器厂从宣武玻璃厂先后请来三个技工，在生产中边操作边讲解，生产人员普遍感到收获大。五十多名灼制玻璃仪器的妇女中，一年来已有二十八人掌握了生产技术，能制一百多种化验仪器。她们灼制的平底管、试管等产品，在质量和产量方面一般都赶上了国营工厂的水平。
    许多社办工厂和街道工厂自办技术课，把车间变成课堂，讲完就试验，随后又生产。北新桥公社化工厂从1959年3月到现在，每周利用业余时间举办一次技术课，生产什么就讲什么，生产人员学习的情绪很高。当他们生产磷酸氢二钾时，就讲化学的分子式等，讲完就当场实习，生产人员感到这样学习，容易懂又记得牢。这个厂生产人员张兰英原来只有小学文化水平，一年来经过技术课的学习和实际生产，已经能掌握制造磷酸氢二钾、硫酸亚铁等七种化学药品的技术。她懂得了一般化学基本知识，还提出从骨头中提炼磷酸的建议，经过试验也获得成功。大栅栏公社玻璃仪器厂在展开技术教育的同时，还开办了文化班，分别讲授小学和初中课程，提高生产人员的文化水平，为技术教育打下了良好的基础。
    许多社办工厂和街道工厂还选出生产能手，列为标兵，当“小先生”，在全厂展开学、比、赶、帮的群众性的学技术运动。东华门公社金属工艺加工厂在技术革新、技术革命运动中，以小组为单位开展技术表演赛。首先由快手、老手表演操作，请慢手、新手看，然后由慢手和新手表演，请老手和快手指导，进行边表演、边讲解、边指导、边总结的办法传播生产技术。两个车间中的二十五名慢手和新手，在技术表演赛中迅速学会了许多生产技术。每人平均日产量提高12％，产品质量也有很大提高。
    许多社办工厂和街道工厂在公社党委的领导下，针对家庭妇女参加生产后存在着自卑和畏难情绪，结合技术教育进行政治思想工作。新街口小五金工厂贺淑珍，刚进工厂看到机器就产生自卑和畏难情绪，感到自己是个家庭妇女，没文化，学会生产技术好比癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉。后来她在工厂领导帮助下，解放了思想，勤学苦练，很快掌握了制作笊篱等技术，并且提出了一些技术革新项目。现在她兴奋地说：“‘天鹅肉’越吃越香了。”
    本报讯　湖南省株洲市以株洲机车车辆厂为中心组成的田心人民公社，坚持为大工厂服务的方针，各项事业有很大发展。
    田心人民公社成立后，突出地抓住了为大工厂服务这个中心环节来组织生产，先后动员了一千多名家庭妇女和闲散劳动力，围绕株洲机车车辆厂的生产需要，举办了许多卫星工厂和运输、服务等事业。一年多来，这些卫星工厂已经生产了水泥、白云石、水玻璃、电石、焦炭、石灰等近一万吨；由职工家属组成的装卸队，自1958年公社成立到现在，已经为车辆厂装卸了六万多吨物资。社员们还为车辆厂修建了面积达二万多平方米的铸钢车间，修建了公路、铁路十五公里。家庭妇女参加生产以后，车辆厂就不用再从外地吸收很多新工人，仅增建宿舍的费用就节省了三十六万多元。
    公社举办的各个生产单位，都是利用大工厂的各种下脚料作为主要原料，这些生产单位的五百多种产品中为大工厂生产服务的产品有二百多种，为大工厂基本建设服务的有一百多种，此外还有为农业生产服务的产品五十多种，为人民生活服务的一百多种。由一个炼钢小组发展成有二百多名工人和四十多台机械设备的社办机械厂，能够为车辆厂生产货车钩、链条折页、纱包线、抽箱盖、锉刀、板牙绞手等四千种产品。一年来，这个工厂共为车辆厂生产了客、货车铸件三百九十吨，各种配件十五万多件，最近又成批生产了铅封钳等比较精密的产品，月产值由开始的几百元增长到现在的十五万元。公社工业从建立到今年3月止，总产值已达一百三十六万多元。
    田心公社根据菜、肉为纲的方针，一年来大力发展了农业生产。现在，这个公社的蔬菜播种面积达五百多亩，比成立公社前扩大了十倍；生猪由原来的四百头发展到一千五百头；养鱼面积达一百二十亩；家禽比1958年翻了一番。公社还组织工业大力支援农业，去年这个公社的农业大队在工业的支援下，已经基本上实现了灌溉自流化、运输车子化，部分食堂和居民有了电灯照明，肥料也大大增加了，因而获得了大丰收，社员的收入也有了很大增长。
    田心公社有社员二万多人，一年多来，由于生产的发展和举办了许多集体福利事业，有劳动能力的社员基本上都已参加生产或工作。全社共办了三十五个食堂，参加食堂吃饭的有一万四千多人。由于深入发动群众，采取自力更生、因地制宜、小型多样等办法和贯彻了积极办好、自愿参加的原则，食堂发展得特别快。此外还办了两个幼儿园、二十二个托儿所（站），共收托儿童一千五百人。还组织了八个服务站，一百零五个服务组，形成一个生活服务网。
    由于生产的飞跃发展，社员的生活水平也相应地有了提高。群众的文化生活也比过去丰富多彩，公社设有俱乐部、阅览室、广播站，定期或不定期地放映电影，并成立了文化学校，又新办了初级小学。
    在公社建立以后，社员受到政治文化教育的机会也更多了，人们的精神面貌、人与人之间的关系也发生了深刻的变化，家庭妇女之间比思想进步、比劳动、比学习、比勤俭、比团结互助已经形成风气。绝大多数家庭妇女在公社成立后已经掌握了各种生产技能，有的已经达到三级技工的水平。1959年一年中，就有五百三十一名家庭妇女被评为先进生产者。
