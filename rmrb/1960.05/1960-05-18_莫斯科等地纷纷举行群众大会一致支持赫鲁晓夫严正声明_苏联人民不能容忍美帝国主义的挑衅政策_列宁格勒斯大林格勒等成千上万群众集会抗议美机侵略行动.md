Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 17th (TASS dispatch): The statement made by Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, at the preparatory meeting of the Paris Four-Power Summit Conference has received widespread support from the Soviet people.

　　Volkov, the director of the Moscow Second Clock Factory, said at the factory's mass rally that the Soviet government is doing everything possible to improve relations between people and between countries, but we cannot tolerate the blatant violation of our sovereignty and our national borders. We cannot conduct friendly negotiations with a country whose government openly supports and shields the war-mongering provocations.

　　Semyakin, a forger at the Moscow First Ball Bearing Plant and a deputy to the Supreme Soviet, pointed out that one can draw the conclusion from the actions of the U.S. leaders that this country does not wish to maintain peace among the people of all countries in its policies. Semyakin said that if one of the participants in the talks takes betrayal of our country as the basis of its policy, then the Soviet government cannot participate in such talks. He said that Khrushchev is absolutely right. Like all Soviet people, I regret that the U.S. reactionary group is disrupting the Paris meeting by using military aircraft to conduct provocative flights over the Soviet Union.

　　In a resolution unanimously adopted at the mass rally of workers at the Moscow "Red Proletarian" Factory, the provocative policy of the U.S. imperialists who sabotaged the summit was condemned, and the firm and consistent policy of the Soviet government aimed at strengthening world peace was warmly supported.

　　Professor Bogorokitsky, director of the Leningrad Electrical Technology Research Institute, said that not only we Soviets, but also citizens of other countries, including ordinary Americans, strongly condemn the provocative flights of spy planes in Soviet airspace. He said that Khrushchev's words, as a statement of a head of a great power, are both serious and very sincere, and will receive the widest resonance. The Soviet Union will never play undignified political tricks at any time, and it will resolutely and consistently implement a policy of world peace.

　　Galkevich, a fitter at the Kiev "Red Excavator" Factory, said at the mass rally of this enterprise that Khrushchev's statement to the leaders of France, Britain, and the United States represents the great Soviet people, who showed the world that they love peace and hope to achieve international cooperation. Ordinary people will never forgive Eisenhower and Herter for their crimes in sabotaging the Paris talks.

　　Tslesov, an electrician participating in the construction of the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station project, said that we hope to be friends with the American people. However, we are indignant at the provocations of the warmongers. We hope that the American people can find the strength to stop the provocateurs. We say to the gentlemen across the ocean: You cannot scare the Soviet people who defeated Hitler! If anyone dares to violate our sacred motherland, he will suffer the same fate as Hitler.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 17th: After hearing the radio broadcast of the statement made by Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, at the preparatory meeting of the Four-Power Summit Conference on the evening of the 16th, the working people of the Soviet Union held rallies one after another, resolutely supporting the resolute statement made by the head of the Soviet government, and severely condemning the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to undermine the Four-Power Summit Conference.

　　A rally with hundreds of employees participating was held at the Moscow "Sickle and Hammer" Steel Factory that evening. Steelworker Chesnokov said at the meeting that it is now clear to the whole world that the provocative actions of U.S. spy planes invading our airspace are deliberate. This is a carefully considered plan by U.S. imperialism to re-escalate international tensions and disrupt the Four-Power Summit. However, we have the power to stop the provocateurs. Our country is now stronger than ever. The successful launch of the spacecraft is proof. Rolling worker Moldvinov said at the meeting that we warmly support Khrushchev's resolute statement. This statement thoroughly exposed the treacherous policy of the Wall Street lackeys and once again pointed out to the world where the "cold war" wind comes from. However, the imperialists must not achieve their sinister goals.

　　Employees of many factories and enterprises in Leningrad also held rallies. At the rally of the ?瓦 Machine Manufacturing Plant, Socialist Labor Hero and Forger Burlakov pointed out that under the current circumstances, it is impossible to negotiate on complete disarmament and other extremely important issues. Negotiations are only possible if the U.S. government no longer takes provocative actions against the Soviet Union.

　　Employees of various enterprises in Kiev also held rallies supporting Khrushchev's statement. Osipenko, a technician in the mechanical workshop of the "Red Excavator" Factory, said at the meeting that now the whole world sees who is hindering the easing of international tensions. Every honest person knows that U.S. imperialism is pursuing a policy of undermining peaceful coexistence and inciting the "cold war."

　　Officers and soldiers of the Soviet combat troops also expressed their support for Khrushchev's statement. Captain Kurkin of a unit in the Moscow Military Region said, let the statement of the head of the Soviet government sober up the feverish heads of the aggressors! We are ready at any time to teach those who conduct military provocations a lesson.

　　This newspaper, Moscow, May 17th: The mass activities of Soviet workers supporting the government's wise and resolute stance on the Four-Power Summit Conference entered a new climax on the evening of the 16th. After hearing Khrushchev's statement at the Paris Four-Power Summit on the radio, night-shift workers in many enterprises in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Stalingrad, Tbilisi, Stavropol, and other cities immediately held rallies. Workers spoke out in support of Comrade Khrushchev's statement and fiercely condemned U.S. imperialism for undermining the Four-Power Summit.

　　Khrushchev's statement spread like lightning throughout Leningrad. The night-shift workers of the famous ?瓦 Machine Manufacturing Plant and the Kirov Factory unanimously and warmly endorsed Khrushchev's statement at the rally, and firmly stated that the workers of Leningrad, like all Soviet workers, must unite their ranks more closely, work selflessly to strengthen the power of the motherland, in order to powerfully strike at invading enemies.

　　After listening to Khrushchev's statement, the soldiers of the Leningrad Military District also expressed their uncontrollable indignation at the shameless acts of U.S. imperialism. Captain Yavlonkov, the commander of a certain artillery company, said, "We fully support the Soviet delegation's decision not to participate in the Paris Four-Power Summit. We cannot sit at the same table with the aggressors." After listening to Khrushchev's statement, Sergeant Yelenmiv of this company called on all soldiers to be more vigilant against imperialism.

    列宁格勒斯大林格勒等成千上万群众集会抗议美机侵略行动
    新华社17日讯　塔斯社莫斯科17日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在巴黎四国首脑会议预备会议上所发表的声明得到了苏联人民的广泛拥护。
    莫斯科第二钟表工厂厂长沃尔科夫在这个工厂的群众大会上说，苏联政府正在尽一切可能来改善各国人民之间和各国之间的关系，但是我们不能容忍对我国主权和我国国境的粗暴的侵犯。我们不能同一个它的政府明目张胆地支持并包庇黩武主义者的挑衅行动的国家进行友好的谈判。
    莫斯科第一滚珠轴承制造厂锻工、苏联最高苏维埃代表谢米亚金指出，从美国领导人的行动中可以得出一个结论，那就是这个国家在自己的政策中不希望维护各国人民之间的和平。谢米亚金说，如果会谈参加者中间有一方把对我国背信弃义当作自己的政策的基础，那么，苏联政府不能参加这样的会谈。他说，赫鲁晓夫是完全正确的。我和所有的苏联人一样，为美国反动集团以军用飞机在苏联上空进行挑衅性飞行来破坏巴黎会晤而感到遗憾。
    莫斯科“红色无产者”工厂工人群众大会在一致通过的决议中谴责了破坏首脑会议的美国帝国主义者的挑衅政策，并且热烈支持苏联政府旨在加强世界和平的坚定而一贯的政策。
    列宁格勒电工技术研究所所长鲍戈罗基茨基教授说，不仅是我们苏联人，而且包括普通的美国人在内的其他各国公民都严厉谴责间谍飞机在苏联领空的挑衅性飞行。他说，作为一个大国首脑的声明，赫鲁晓夫的既严肃而又非常真诚的话，将得到最广泛的共鸣。苏联在任何时候也不会玩弄不体面的政治把戏，它将坚决而一贯地执行世界和平的政策。
    基辅“红色掘土机”工厂钳工加尔克维奇在这个企业的群众大会上说，赫鲁晓夫向法国、英国和美国领导人发表的声明是代表伟大的苏联人民在说话，苏联人民向全世界表明他们热爱和平，希望达到国际合作。普通的人们永远也不会原谅艾森豪威尔和赫脱破坏巴黎谈判的罪过。
    参加建设古比雪夫水电站工程的电焊工茨列索夫说，我们希望同美国人民友好。但是，我们对战争贩子的挑衅行动感到愤慨。我们希望美国人民能找到力量来制止挑衅者。我们对大洋彼岸的先生们说：你们吓不倒曾打垮过希特勒的苏联人民！如果谁敢侵犯我们神圣的祖国，他将得到与希特勒同样的下场。
    新华社莫斯科17日电　苏联各地劳动人民在16日晚间听到了电台广播的苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在四国首脑会议预备会议上发表的声明后，纷纷举行集会，坚决支持苏联政府首脑所发表的这一果断声明，并且严厉谴责美帝国主义企图破坏四国首脑会议的阴谋。
    莫斯科“镰刀与锤子”钢铁工厂当天晚间举行了有数百名职工参加的集会。炼钢工人契斯诺科夫在会上说，现在全世界都清楚地看到，美国间谍飞机侵犯我国领空的挑衅行动是有目的的。这是美帝国主义为了重新加剧国际紧张局势和破坏四国首脑会谈，经过周密考虑后拟定出来的计划。但是，我们有力量制止挑衅者。我国现在比任何时候都更加强大。宇宙飞船发射成功就是证明。压延工人莫尔德维诺夫在会上说，我们热烈支持赫鲁晓夫的果断的声明。这个声明彻底地揭露了华尔街奴仆们的背信弃义的政策，并且再一次向全世界指出“冷战”之风来自何方。但是，帝国主义者决不能达到他们的阴险目的。
    列宁格勒许多工厂企业的职工也都举行了集会。在?瓦机器制造厂的集会上，社会主义劳动英雄、锻工布尔拉科夫指出，在目前的情况下，根本不可能就彻底裁军和其它极端重要的问题进行谈判。只有在美国政府不再采取反对苏联的挑衅行动的条件下，才有可能进行谈判。
    基辅各企业的职工也纷纷举行了支持赫鲁晓夫声明的集会。“红色掘土机”工厂机械车间技师奥西潘科在会上说，现在，全世界都看到，是谁在阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和。每一个正直的人都知道，美帝国主义在执行破坏和平共处和煽动“冷战”的政策。
    苏联各战斗部队的官兵也纷纷表示支持赫鲁晓夫的声明。莫斯科军区某部队上尉库尔金说，让苏联政府首脑的声明清醒一下侵略者发热的头脑吧！我们随时准备教训那些进行军事挑衅的人。
    本报莫斯科17日电　苏联各地职工支持政府对四国首脑会议的英明坚决立场的群众性活动在16日晚进入了新的高潮。莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、斯大林格勒，第比利斯、斯塔伏罗波尔等城市许多企业的夜班职工在收音机中听到了赫鲁晓夫在巴黎四国首脑会见时所发表的声明后，立即举行集会，工人们纷纷发表讲话支持赫鲁晓夫同志的声明，并猛烈斥责美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议。
    赫鲁晓夫的声明像闪电一样地传遍了整个列宁格勒。著名的?瓦机器制造厂基洛夫工厂的夜班工人在集会上一致热烈赞同赫鲁晓夫的声明，并坚决表示列宁格勒工人像苏联所有工人一样一定要更紧密地团结自己的队伍，忘我劳动加强祖国威力，以便有力打击来犯的敌人。
    列宁格勒军区的军人们听了赫鲁晓夫声明后也都对美帝国主义的无耻行径表示不可抑制的愤慨。某炮兵连指挥上尉雅伏隆科夫说，“我们完全支持苏联代表团不参加巴黎四国首脑会议的决定，我们不能同侵略者坐在一张桌子旁”，这个连的一位军士叶连密夫听了赫鲁晓夫声明后号召所有战士要更加提高对帝国主义的警惕性。
