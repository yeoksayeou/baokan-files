Xinhua News Agency, Changchun dispatch: Soybean planting is underway in various parts of Jilin Province. As of May 5th, the province had completed 66.1% of its soybean planting plan, an increase of 12% compared to the same period last year.

Promoting the experience of equidistant precision planting is a significant feature of this year's soybean planting work in Jilin Province. Several years of local trials have proven that implementing equidistant precision planting for soybeans (controlling row and plant spacing and punching holes by machine, with one seed per hole) can increase yields by 20%-30% under the same conditions. In order to widely promote this advanced experience, various places have held soybean yield increase experience exchange meetings, discussed the benefits of equidistant precision planting of soybeans, vigorously produced precision planting tools, trained technicians, and carefully selected seeds to prepare for equidistant precision planting. Yushu County has already planted more than 1,070,000 mu of soybeans, most of which are equidistant precision planting. Various places are cultivating large-area soybean experimental fields and high-yield fields. These fields account for about 30% to 50% of the total area.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin dispatch: Soybean planting has generally begun in Heilongjiang. As of May 9th, the province had planted 4.4 million mu.

Heilongjiang Province is one of China's major soybean producing areas. This year, the soybean planting area will be expanded compared to last year. Bayan, Huachuan, Bin County and other soybean-producing areas plan to increase planting by 10% to 20% compared to last year. Many areas have also reclaimed wasteland to expand the soybean planting area. The Hegang Reclamation Area will plant soybeans on 2.5 million mu of newly reclaimed land.

The amount of fertilizer applied to each mu of soybean cultivated land in the province has reached about 4,000 jin, and most of the seeds are standard good varieties with high yields such as "Zihua No. 4" and "Jingshan Pu." During planting, the spacing between rows is generally reduced to increase the number of rows, and reasonable close planting is implemented.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang dispatch: A high tide of soybean planting has been launched in rural areas of Liaoning Province. So far, the province has planted more than 3.75 million mu of soybeans, more than double the planting area in the same period last year. Benxi area, which is progressing faster, has completed 80% of its planting plan.

Various places in Liaoning generally applied base fertilizer to soybean crops this year and promoted good varieties. In Faku, Changtu and other major soybean producing counties, the average fertilizer application per mu is about 5,000 jin, an increase of 20% over last year. The more than 750,000 mu of soybeans already planted in Changtu County are basically planted with the high-yield, high oil-yielding "Little Golden Yellow" good variety. Tieling has generally promoted the "Fengdi Huang" good variety. Various places have also generally promoted advanced yield-increasing experiences such as reducing row spacing and increasing rows, and intercropping and relay cropping with corn. In Kaiyuan County, 70% of the soybean fields that have already been planted have implemented reduced row spacing and increased rows. After reducing row spacing and increasing rows, every 15 mu is approximately equal to adding one mu of soybean area.

During planting, various places have also established 400,000 mu of high-yield soybean demonstration plots as command bases to drive the increase in production in ordinary fields.

This newspaper reports: Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province, implementing the principle of "taking grain as the key link," adopted three methods simultaneously: single cropping of oil crops and intercropping of oil crops, herbaceous oil crops and woody oil crops, establishing oil crop bases and utilizing scattered land, to solve the contradiction of land competition between oil and grain. The county expanded the area of herbaceous oil crops such as sesame, peanuts, soybeans, and rapeseed by 260,000 mu, and planted 90,000 mu of woody oil crops such as oil tea and tung oil trees; at the same time, it increased the area of early rice cultivated land by 30,000 mu through methods such as reclaiming wasteland, changing single cropping to double cropping, and transforming dry land into paddy fields.

Farmers in Dongxiang County have experience in planting oil crops, and the county also has a lot of barren mountains that can be utilized, but in the past, the area planted with oil crops was very small. In response to this situation, the county party committee proposed adopting various methods to tap the potential of land and develop oil crops. The specific methods to solve the contradiction of land competition between oil and grain are:

	(1) Grasp both single cropping and intercropping of oil crops. The masses in various places in Dongxiang County have experience in intercropping oil crops in grain or other crops. After general summary and promotion, through methods such as intercropping sesame in sweet potato fields, intercropping soybeans in sorghum fields, and intercropping peanuts in sesame fields, the county expanded the area of herbaceous oil crops by more than 200,000 mu.
	(2) Vigorously grasp the production of woody oil crops. Dongxiang County utilized barren mountains and hills to plant woody oil crops extensively and build oil forests on a large scale. The county planted 90,000 mu of woody oil crops in spring afforestation, and at the same time conducted a general reclamation of existing oil forests.
	(3) On the one hand, establish oil crop production bases in a planned way, and on the other hand, make full use of scattered land. The county utilized small pieces of scattered land such as field ridges, canals, roadsides, and house sides to plant about 30,000 mu of soybeans and sunflowers.

    扩大面积　选用良种　革新播种技术
    东北三省力争大豆多种高产
    江西东乡县解决争地矛盾油粮齐扩大
    据新华社长春电　吉林省各地正在播种大豆。截至本月5日，全省已完成大豆播种计划的66.1％，比去年同时期增长12％。
    推行等距点播经验，是今年吉林省大豆播种工作中的很大特色。几年来各地试验证明，大豆实行等距点播（由机具控制行、株距和扎眼，一个眼下一个籽），在同样条件下可增产20％—30％。为了广泛推广这项先进经验，各地都召开了大豆增产经验交流会，讨论了大豆等距点播的好处，大力制作点播工具，培养技术手，精选种子，为等距点播作好准备。榆树县已播种的一百零七万多亩大豆，绝大部分都是等距点播的。各地都在培植大面积大豆试验田和高产田。这些田的面积约占总面积的30％到50％。
    新华社哈尔滨电　黑龙江各地普遍开犁播种大豆。截至本月9日，全省已经种了四百四十万亩。
    黑龙江省是我国大豆主要产区之一。今年大豆播种面积将比去年扩大。巴彦、桦川、宾县等盛产大豆的地区，计划比去年增种10％到20％。许多地区还开垦荒地扩大大豆播种面积，合江垦区将有二百五十万亩新开荒地种上大豆。
    全省大豆耕地每亩施肥量都达到四千斤左右，种籽大部分是产量高的“紫花四号”、“荆山璞”等标准良种，播种时，普遍缩垅增行，实行合理密植。
    据新华社沈阳电　辽宁省农村掀起了大豆播种高潮。到目前为止，全省已播种大豆三百七十五万多亩，播种面积比去年同期多一倍。进度较快的本溪地区，已经完成播种计划80％。
    辽宁各地今年普遍为大豆作物施了基肥，推广了良种。大豆主要产区法库、昌图等县，平均每亩施肥五千斤左右，比去年增加20％。昌图县已经播种的七十五万多亩大豆，基本上都是种的高产、出油率高的“小金黄”良种。铁岭普遍推广了“丰地黄”良种。各地还普遍推行了缩垅增行和与玉米间种、套种等先进增产经验。开原县已经播种的豆田中，有70％实行了缩垅增行。缩垅增行后，每十五亩约等于增加了一亩大豆面积。
    各地在播种中还建立了四十万亩大豆丰产方，作为带动一般田增产的指挥基地。
    本报讯　江西省东乡县贯彻以粮为纲的方针，采取油料单种与油料套种同时并举、草本油料与木本油料同时并举、建立油料基地与利用零星土地同时并举三项办法，解决了油、粮争地的矛盾。全县扩大芝麻、花生、大豆、油菜等草本油料作物二十六万亩，种植油茶、油桐等木本油料作物九万亩；同时还通过开荒、单季改双季、旱地变水田等办法，增加了三万亩早稻耕地面积。
    东乡县农民既有种油料的经验，同时全县又有很多荒山可以利用，但是过去油料种植面积很少。针对这种情况，县委提出采用多种办法，大挖土地潜力，发展油料作物。解决油粮争地矛盾的具体办法是：
      （一）既抓油料单种，又抓套种。东乡县各地群众都有在粮食或其他作物中套种油料的经验，经过普遍总结推广，通过在红薯地里套种芝麻，在高粱地里套种大豆，在芝麻地里套种花生等办法，全县扩大草本油料种植面积二十多万亩。
      （二）大抓木本油料生产。东乡县利用荒山丘陵，广种木本油料，大兴油林。全县在春季造林中种下木本油料九万亩，同时还对原有油林普遍进行了一次垦复。
      （三）一方面有计划地建立油料生产基地，同时又充分利用零星土地。全县利用田埂、渠道、路旁、屋边等小块零星土地，种大豆、向日葵约三万亩。
