Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 24th. The Qingdao Public Security Bureau, based on tips from the masses and after careful investigation, uncovered a case of special agents sent by the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and lawfully arrested Li Xuanmao, a special agent dispatched by the "Second Group of the Kuomintang Central Committee" of Taiwan, and seized his un-sent secret intelligence and secret writing tools as evidence of his crimes.

The special agent Li Xuanmao is from Lijia Shagou Village, Laoshan District, Qingdao. He came from a landlord family. During the Kuomintang rule, he colluded with Kuomintang bureaucrats, specializing in speculation and taking advantage of his power to bully people. After the liberation of Qingdao, he continued to be an enemy of the people and fled to Hong Kong in the spring of 1950. Soon after arriving in Hong Kong, he colluded with special agents and actively delivered letters for them. In May 1958, Li Xuanmao formally joined the Chiang Kai-shek clique's special agent organization, the "Second Group of the Kuomintang Central Committee," and received special agent training in intelligence gathering and secret writing communication. In February of last year, Li Xuanmao was dispatched by the spy agency and sneaked back to Qingdao from Hong Kong to carry out espionage activities such as collecting our military, political, and economic intelligence, actively recruiting personnel, and attempting to develop a spy organization. However, his criminal activities were recognized by the masses. The public security organs, based on reports from the masses and after careful investigation, obtained conclusive evidence and recently arrested him according to law.

    破坏社会主义建设必受打击
    青岛抓住一名蒋帮特务
    新华社济南24日电　青岛市公安局根据群众检举，经过周密侦察，破获了一起蒋介石集团派遣特务案件，依法逮捕了台湾“国民党中央委员会第二组”派遣的特务分子李宣懋，并缴获了他尚未发出的密写情报以及密写工具等罪证。
    特务分子李宣懋，是青岛崂山区李家沙沟村人，地主出身，在国民党统治时期，他曾勾结国民党官僚，专门投机倒把，仗势欺人。青岛解放后，他继续与人民为敌，于1950年春逃往香港。他到香港不久，就和特务分子进行勾搭，积极为特务分子传递信件。1958年5月李宣懋正式参加了蒋介石集团特务组织“国民党中央委员会第二组”，并接受了刺探情报、密写联络等特务训练。去年2月，李宣懋受特务机关派遣，从香港潜回青岛，进行搜集我军事、政治、经济情报等特务活动，积极网罗人员，企图发展特务组织。但是他的罪恶活动被群众所识破。公安机关根据群众的检举，并且经过周密的调查，获得了确凿的罪证，最近依法将他逮捕。
