    To the Japanese People
    Guo Moruo
    The Japanese people are holding the 16th National United Action to oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. Four million six hundred thousand workers will hold strikes successively. The momentum is huge, like a raging fire. I write four poems to express my support.
      1. The fifteenth of the first month is a joyous time for the world,
         The Soviet Union shot down a black airplane.
         Exposing the mask of peaceful pretense,
         The idea of opening the skies is strange.
         The robbers indeed have their logic,
         The people will never be deceived.
         Dulles is dead, but his soul remains,
         Eisenhower is the culprit today.
     2. I love this year's Red May,
        And see even more red skies over Japan.
        The sixteenth new action,
        Four million people on great strike.
        The U.S. imperialist conspiracy is becoming clear,
        The butcher's nature is habitually that of a henchman.
        Black airplanes are stockpiled at bases,
        Six hundred million Chinese will not tolerate it.
     3. How can the war be easily forgotten?
        The struggle spreads throughout the Pacific.
        Shout aloud: "U.S. imperialism, get out!"
        Force the henchmen to step down early.
        Playing with fire will lead to self-immolation is a common principle,
        Human determination will surely prevail over heaven, the righteous voice is proclaimed.
        The South Korean dynasty has fallen, with Syngman Rhee,
        How can the dog party be allowed to go mad again!
     4. Most shameless of all is Nobusuke Kishi,
        Not knowing repentance, ignoring heavenly principles.
        Having lost his mind, he recognizes the thief as his father,
        With a thick face, he willingly prostitutes himself.
        The people of the three islands are now rising up,
        The public opinion of the five continents is watching.
        Expel the invaders and fight for democracy,
        The rising sun shines over Mount Fuji.

    寄日本人民
    郭沫若
    日本人民正举行第十六次全国统一行动，以反对日美军事同盟条约。有四百六十万工人将先后举行罢工。声势浩大，如火如荼。成诗四首，以致声援。
      一五一佳期天下庆，苏联打下黑飞机。揭穿面具和平假，开放天空想法奇。强盗果然有逻辑，人民决不受欺绐。杜希死后魂仍在，艾克于今是罪魁。
     二我爱今年红五月，扶桑更见满天红。第十六次新行动，四百万人大罢工。美帝阴谋经见日，屠夫根性惯帮凶。飞机黑色屯基地，六亿神州也不容。
     三战祸犹新岂易忘？斗争传遍太平洋。高呼美帝滚回去，迫使帮凶早下场。玩火自焚公例在，胜天人定正声扬。南朝已倒李承晚，狗党何容再发狂！四无耻之尤岸信介，不知悔祸昧天良。丧心已认贼为父，厚脸还甘自作娼。三岛民情今蹶起，五洲舆论正瞻望。驱除寇盗争民主，富士山头旭日光。一九六○年五月十三日作
