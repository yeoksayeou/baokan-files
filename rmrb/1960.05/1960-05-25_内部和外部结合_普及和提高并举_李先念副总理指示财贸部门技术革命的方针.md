Xinhua News Agency, May 24th. Li Xiannian, member the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the the State Council, delivered an important speech today at the National Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Performance Conference for Finance and Trade Departments.

After briefly explaining the excellent situation of the continuing leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, Li Xiannian emphasized that an important characteristic of the current situation is that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has been universally launched along the correct, scientific, and mass-based path pointed out by Chairman Mao. This movement will play a regular and significant role in socialist construction. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have long called for breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, and daring to think, speak, and act. They also pointed out that our country's poverty, backwardness, and technological backwardness may seem bad, but are actually good. Poverty leads to change; we must work and make revolution, and make revolution vigorously. Relying on the "three magic weapons" of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and relying on the broad mass movement, the technical innovation and technical revolution movements in various localities and departments across the country have made significant achievements. These achievements prove that the working people are the most intelligent, and the exploiters are not intelligent. Marxists believe that the people are the creators of history, the creators of social material wealth, and also the creators and innovators of science and technology. In the past, the wealth and science created by the working people were monopolized by a small number of bourgeoisie and used to intensify the exploitation of the working people. This greatly restricted the enthusiasm and possibility of workers engaging in scientific creation. Under the socialist system, the situation is fundamentally different. Science and technology serve the people and benefit the people. In this way, science and technology have a broad mass base, and it is possible to create a mass movement in which everyone invents, everyone creates, and everyone innovates. The superiority of the socialist system and the wise leadership of the great and correct Mao Zedong Thought and the Party Central Committee are the decisive conditions for the comprehensive development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

Li Xiannian said that we cannot be satisfied with our current achievements. Technical innovation and technical revolution are endless and have no bottom. Our existing achievements are only preliminary and far from our goals. To achieve mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, we must continue to advance bravely along the correct, scientific, and mass-based road pointed out by Chairman Mao. We must proceed from reality and adopt foreign methods when possible, use indigenous methods when possible, or a combination of both, using both indigenous and foreign methods simultaneously. We must establish great ambitions and strive to climb the peaks of world science and technology in a not-too-long period.

Li Xiannian emphasized that the finance and trade departments have much to accomplish in the entire technical innovation and technical revolution movement. We must implement the principle of combining internal and external forces. On the one hand, we must actively support the technical innovation and technical revolution movements in various departments, including the agricultural, industrial, and transportation sectors. On the other hand, we must greatly develop the technical innovation and technical revolution movements in all internal links of our departments, such as purchasing, processing, storage, transportation, sales, accounting, as well as catering and service. All these aspects should vigorously promote mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. We must implement the principle of promoting both popularization and improvement simultaneously. On the one hand, we must summarize existing experiences and selectively promote those projects that save the most labor, have the greatest economic benefits, and are easy to manufacture and promote, such as the reform of cooking utensils, the reform of feeding tools, and the reform of warehousing and transportation tools. On the other hand, we must continue to improve, actively carry out new creations and inventions, and advance towards the cutting edge of science. What others can do, we must do; what others cannot do, we must also do. While vigorously reforming tools, we must also pay attention to improving operational skills for necessary manual labor.

Li Xiannian also mentioned that the comprehensive utilization of resources is an important part of technical innovation and technical revolution, and also an important way to expand the sources of raw materials. According to Chairman Mao's instructions, all localities are comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and striving to increase the production of grain, cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruit, medicine, and miscellaneous crops. This will provide richer resources for comprehensive utilization. We must widely use various domestic and wild raw materials: the seeds, skins, shells, roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, and juices of plants, and the meat, skins, fur, bones, horns, blood, organs, glands, and miscellaneous parts of animals are all very valuable raw materials and have multiple uses. We must also widely use industrial waste liquids, wastewater, waste gas, sludge, etc. Our vision should not be limited to the raw materials we already have. We should broaden our horizons and bring back the raw materials that we could obtain but are not currently obtaining. Sitting and waiting to be fed is the thinking of lazy people, not the attitude of revolutionaries. The potential for comprehensive utilization is enormous. In some enterprises, the value of by-products exceeds the value of the main products as a result of comprehensive utilization. For example, the value of by-products from the comprehensive utilization of coal exceeds the value of coal itself; the value of many "treasures" on a pig exceeds the value of pork. By-products exceeding main products is a major event. All possible departments should strive in this direction.

Li Xiannian concluded by saying that this conference has been very successful and will greatly promote the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade system. The comrades attending this conference are all advanced workers or representatives of advanced collectives, and are all inventors, creators, and innovators. It is hoped that under the leadership of the Party, you will adhere to putting politics in command, study Mao Zedong Thought well, and always maintain your advanced status. You must be advanced not only in technology, but also in political thought and cultural learning. You must be both red and expert, and thoroughly red and deeply expert. You must promote the communist style, take on difficulties, give way to convenience, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward. In your work, you must be down-to-earth, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, prevent exaggeration, and always maintain the fine style of humility, prudence, and close ties with the masses.

    内部和外部结合　普及和提高并举
    李先念副总理指示财贸部门技术革命的方针
    新华社24日讯　中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李先念，今天在全国财贸部门技术革新和技术革命表演大会上作了重要讲话。
    李先念在概括地说明了目前工农业生产继续跃进的大好形势之后，着重指出，当前形势的一个重要特点，是技术革新技术革命运动已经沿着毛主席所指出的正确的、科学的、全民的轨道普遍开展起来了，这个运动将在社会主义建设中起经常的重大的作用。党中央和毛主席早就提出破除迷信，解放思想，敢想敢说敢做的号召，并且指出我国一穷二白、技术落后，看起来是坏事，其实是好事。穷则思变，要干，要革命。而且革得很起劲。依靠总路线、大跃进、人民公社“三大法宝”，依靠广泛的群众运动，全国各地方、各部门的技术革新和技术革命运动已经作出了重大的成就。这个成就证明劳动人民是最聪明的，剥削者并不聪明。马克思主义者认为，人民群众是历史的创造者，是社会物质财富的创造者，也是科学技术的创造者和革新者。从前劳动人民创造的财富和科学，被资产阶级少数人垄断起来，把它用来加重对劳动人民的剥削。这就大大限制了劳动者从事科学创造的积极性和可能性。在社会主义制度下，情况就根本不同了，科学技术是服务于人民的，是为人民造福的，这样科学技术就有了广泛的群众基础，就有可能造成人人发明、人人创造、人人革新的全民运动。社会主义制度的优越性，伟大正确的毛泽东思想和党中央的英明领导，是技术革新、技术革命运动全面发展的决定性条件。
    李先念说，我们不能满足于现在已有的成绩，技术革新和技术革命是永无止境的，是没有底的。我们现有的成绩还只是初步的，离开我们的目标还远得很。要实现机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化，必须继续沿着毛主席所指示的正确的、科学的、全民的道路奋勇前进。要从实际出发，能洋就洋，能土就土，或者半洋半土，土洋并举。要树雄心，立大志，力争在不太长的时间内，攀登世界科学技术的高峰。
    李先念着重指出，在整个技术革新技术革命运动中，财贸部门的事情大有可为。要实行内部与外部相结合的方针。一方面积极支援各个部门技术革新和技术革命运动，包括农业部门、工业部门、交通运输部门的技术革新和技术革命运动；另一方面大大开展本部门内部各个环节上的技术革新技术革命运动，例如收购、加工、保管、调运、销售、核算以及饮食、服务等方面，都应当大搞机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化。要实行普及与提高并举的方针。一方面总结现有的经验，有重点地普遍推广那些节省劳力最多、经济效果最大而又便于制作、便于推广的项目，例如炊具改革、饲养工具改革、仓储运输工具改革等等；另一方面要继续提高，积极进行新的创造发明，向科学尖端进军。别人能做的我们要做，别人不能做的我们也要做。在大力改革工具的同时，对于必要的手工劳动，还要注意提高操作技术。
    李先念还谈到，资源的综合利用是技术革新和技术革命的一个重要内容，也是扩大原料材料来源的一个重要途径。各地根据毛主席的指示，正在全面发展农、林、牧、副、渔，努力增产粮、棉、油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂，这就能够为综合利用提供更为丰富的资源。要广泛利用各种家生和野生的原料，植物的籽、皮、壳、根、茎、叶、花、果、汁，动物的肉、皮、毛、骨、角、血、脏、腺、杂，样样都是非常宝贵的原料，都有多方面的用途。还要广泛地利用工业的废液、废水、废气、污泥等等。我们的眼光不能局限于已经拿到手的原料，应当把眼光放宽些，把可能拿到而现在没有拿到的原料拿回来。坐吃现成饭，是懒汉思想，不是革命者的态度。综合利用的潜力大得很。有些企业，综合利用的结果，副产品的价值超过了主要产品的价值。例如，煤炭综合利用的副产品的价值，超过了煤炭本身的价值；猪身上许多“宝”的价值，超过了猪肉的价值。副产超过主产，这是一件大事。一切有可能的部门，都应当向这个方向努力。
    李先念最后说，这次会议开得很好，对财贸系统的技术革新技术革命运动将发生很大的推动作用。这次到会的同志，都是先进工作者或者先进集体的代表，都是发明家、创造家、革新家。希望你们在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，好好地学习毛泽东思想，永远保持先进，不仅技术上先进，政治思想上也要先进，文化学习上也要先进。要做到又红又专、红透专深。要发扬共产主义的风格，见困难就上，见方便就让，见先进就赶，见后进就帮。在工作中要脚踏实地，戒骄戒躁，防止浮夸，永远保持谦虚谨慎、联系群众的优良作风。
