Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The Nepalese table tennis team held a friendly match with the Beijing Youth Table Tennis Team this afternoon at the Beijing Gymnasium, and was warmly welcomed by approximately four thousand spectators.

The seven male and female players from the visiting team all use penhold grips and are capable of launching sudden attacks from defensive chops. They played a total of ten friendly matches with the young Beijing team today.

The Beijing Youth Team, composed of Zhuang Zedong, Wang Jian and others, mostly use shakehand grips. Their smashes are fast and powerful, and their serves are varied. They won a total of nine matches today.

The Nepal National Men's Singles Champion, seventeen-year-old Ya. Pu. Lohani, had a very tense match today against He Yingqian, a sixteen-year-old shakehand grip player from the Beijing Youth Team. Both players adopted a chop-and-attack strategy. Lohani won the first game 21-18, but He Yingqian then won a game back 21-15. In the crucial third game, Lohani played steadily on both defense and attack, eventually winning 21-13. Their performance won warm applause from the audience.

Today, Ma Yuehan, Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation, Rong Gaotang, Vice Chairman, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and Zhou Shujia, Vice President of the China-Nepal Friendship Association, and others attended and watched the match. After the match, they went to the field to shake hands with the players from both sides and took photos together.

The Nepalese table tennis team will also hold a friendly match with the Beijing Student Table Tennis Team on the evening of the 4th.
