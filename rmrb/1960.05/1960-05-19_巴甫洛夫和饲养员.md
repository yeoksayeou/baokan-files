    Pavlov and the Swineherd
    Yu Guangzhi

    In the documentary film "Troops Engage in Production" produced by the "August First" Film Studio, a swineherd in a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army used the "conditioned reflex principle" of Pavlov's theory to gradually cultivate conditioned reflexes in pigs by ringing a bell as a signal. In this way, when he rings the bell at a certain time, the pigs will wake up, eat, and sleep according to different bell sounds; at another time, when he rings the bell, the pigs will go to pasture, walk, and bathe according to different bell sounds. This swineherd used to raise only one or two dozen pigs, and he was always busy with them, with no time to spare. Now, he raises hundreds of pigs by himself. And this swineherd relies on that copper bell to manage these hundreds of pigs obediently. Because the collective life of the pig herd is regulated, diseases are reduced, and each one grows very fat.

    Only in the socialist era of New China have people opened the treasure house of wisdom, and all precious scientific and cultural heritage has a place to be used and can truly benefit mankind. The brilliant Pavlovian theory is not only related to medicine, psychology, and biology, but also to pig raising. The great name of Pavlov is not only related to physicians, psychologists, and biologists, but also to ordinary swineherds. In today's China, which continues to leap forward and vigorously promote technological revolution and technological innovation, we will apply more of mankind's existing scientific achievements to production, and we will also create more scientific achievements.

    巴甫洛夫和饲养员 
    于广志
    “八一”电影制片厂摄制的“部队搞生产”的纪录影片上，解放军某部的一个养猪员根据巴甫洛夫学说的“条件反射原理”以摇铃为信号逐渐培养了猪的条件反射。这样，他在一定时间把铃一摇，猪就会按照不同铃声起床、吃食、睡觉；在另一个时间把铃一摇，猪又会按照不同的铃声去放牧、散步、洗澡。这个饲养员过去只养一、二十头猪，成天跟着猪打转转，弄得手脚无暇，费劲极了。现在却是一个人养了数百头猪。而这个饲养员就是依赖那个铜铃，把这数百只猪管理得服服贴贴，由于猪群的集体生活有了规律，病疫减少了，一只只都长得很肥胖。
    只有在社会主义时代的新中国，人们打开了智慧的宝库，一切珍贵的科学文化遗产，才有了用武之地，才能真正为人类谋福利。天才的巴甫洛夫学说，才不仅和医学、心理学、生物学有了关连，而且和养猪问题也有了关连，伟大的巴甫洛夫的名字，才不仅和医学家、心理学家、生物学家有了关连，而且和平凡的饲养员也有了关连。在我国继续跃进、大搞技术革命和技术革新的今天，我们将要更多地把人类已有的科学成就应用到生产中去，我们也将创造出更多的科学成绩来。
