Heilongjiang Launches Mass Movement for Prospecting, Mining, and Iron Smelting; Small Blast Furnaces and Small Mines Emerge in Batches
Shanxi Focuses on Coal, Iron, Ore, and Transportation; Steel Production Increases Comprehensively

(Our newspaper, Fuzhou, 30th dispatch) A mass movement for large-scale coal and iron production in Fujian Province has formed a high tide. In May, the average daily output of coal and iron increased by 48% and 22% respectively compared with the average daily output in the first quarter.

Entering May, Party committees at all levels in Fujian Province generally strengthened their leadership over the coal and iron front, established unified command structures, and sent thousands of cadres deep into grassroots factories and mines; at the same time, a large number of laborers were transferred to the coal and iron production front to strengthen the front line of production, thus effectively guaranteeing the steady rise in coal and iron production.

In this large-scale coal and iron production campaign in Fujian Province, great emphasis was placed on grasping both high yield and "area." Facts have proven that this is the key to ensuring the rapid increase in coal and iron production. Grasping high yield means requiring existing small native and small foreign groups to actively carry out technological transformation, improve utilization coefficients, and ensure that the unit area yield and total output are increased. Grasping "area" means requiring the rate of furnace operation to be increased and a large number of one-cubic-meter and three-cubic-meter furnaces to be rapidly built.

Under the guidance of this thinking, provinces, special districts, and counties have all established coal and iron bases in accordance with the instructions of the provincial party committee; communes and brigades with coal and iron resources have vigorously engaged in "small native groups"; counties that have not yet discovered coal and iron resources and various provincial-level agencies have also sent large numbers of cadres, laborers, funds, and equipment to areas with coal and iron resources, adopting the method of self-management or joint management with local counties and communes to establish coal and iron production bases. According to the plan, each county will establish a coal and iron base before the end of June and gradually develop it into a joint enterprise with "five smalls" in groups (small coal mines, small iron mines, small iron smelting plants, small cement plants, small earth railways).

In terms of grasping production, all localities are earnestly doing a good job in fuel, ore, and transportation, launching a mass movement for coal mining and ore extraction, and implementing the policy of walking on two legs. On the one hand, they are actively increasing the output of key coal and iron mines, and at the same time, they are vigorously grasping the "small native groups" of coal and iron mines, vigorously developing small coal mines and small iron mines, and launching a mass movement for reporting and finding mines. Wherever there is coal and iron, they mine it. In terms of transportation, they emphasize using all modern transportation tools and folk transportation tools, promote the advanced experience of "one-dragon" transportation, and quickly realize "dragon networkization." At the same time, they are strengthening the construction of simple roads and earth railways to ensure the needs of coal and iron production. All localities have also universally launched technological innovation and technological revolution movements, and strengthened the comprehensive utilization of raw materials and fuels. Currently, the main focus in all localities is on promoting the comprehensive utilization of coal gas and developing cement production with slag.

In this coal and iron movement, cities have stepped up steelmaking and rushed to manufacture mining and smelting equipment to meet the needs of the rapid development of coal and iron production.

(Our newspaper, Harbin, 30th dispatch) All localities and industries in Heilongjiang Province have widely launched a mass movement of mass prospecting, mass mining, and large-scale establishment of "small foreign groups" for iron and steel; so that on the basis of the original nine small and medium-sized mines and twelve "small foreign groups" iron smelting points in the province, a new situation has emerged in which large and small mining points are all over the province, small blast furnaces are emerging in batches, and development towards "small foreign joint ventures" has begun.

The mass activities of prospecting and reporting mines have greatly changed the face of the metallurgical industry in Heilongjiang Province. According to incomplete statistics, 82 new iron ore points have been discovered in various parts of the province, of which 55 have been proven. While carrying out large-scale mass prospecting and reporting mines, the iron and steel "small foreign groups" have also developed rapidly. At present, there are 49 new high furnace points that are being built or are being prepared to be built and renovated with old furnaces, in various parts of the province, with about 200 small blast furnaces. Among them, the small blast furnaces newly built or renovated in Mishan, Ning'an, Boli, Nenjiang and other counties have already happily poured out molten iron.

In the work of running iron and steel "small foreign groups," Heilongjiang Province has also adopted the method of combining the departments and bureaus of various business systems and certain counties on the basis of voluntary mutual benefit, combining strips and blocks, and jointly prospecting and building furnaces, which has accelerated the development of iron and steel "small foreign groups." The modes of cooperation include some where the departments and counties jointly establish small blast furnace points, and some where a certain city or county designates several mine points or several blast furnaces to the departments and bureaus. A blast furnace jointly built by Ning'an County and the Water Conservancy Department, which acted faster, has been put into production.

(Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th dispatch) The staff and workers on the steel front in Shanxi Province, who are enthusiastically carrying out the competition of "Definitely Exceeding the First Quarter in the Second Quarter," are becoming more and more energetic. In the past half month, the daily output of steel, steel products, and pig iron in the province has increased comprehensively. Compared with the first half of the month, the average daily output from May 15th to 25th increased by an average of 9.7% for steel, an average of 12% for pig iron, and an average of 40% for steel products.

The scale of this overproduction campaign launched by the steel system in Shanxi Province is as great as the Great Leap Forward in Steelmaking in 1958. Implementing the principle of grasping coal, iron, ore, and transportation together is a prominent feature of this movement. At the beginning of the movement, the party secretaries, factory directors, and engineers of large steel plants and large foreign group steel bases ate and slept next to the furnace, and went deep into the coal mines, mines, and transportation departments to mobilize the masses to carry out the steel protection movement. All steel enterprises also generally carried out key queuing, seizing weak links and solving them first.

Transportation is the weakest link in the weak links of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company. The party committee of this company decided to concentrate its efforts on overcoming this hurdle first. They established a general headquarters, and on the one hand, mobilized the staff and workers of the transportation department to carry out technological innovation, and on the other hand, mobilized the factories under the company to carry out transportation cooperation. Due to the improvement of transportation efficiency, the daily output of pig iron of this company has increased by 13% compared with the past.

The staff and workers of the coal mines, mines, railways, and highways in the province all put ensuring steel production in the first place; the people's communes in Jinzhong, Jinnan, Jin southeast special districts and the suburbs of Taiyuan City also transferred manpower to help the steel plants mine ore and repair earth railways. The Taiyuan Railway Bureau and Shanxi State-owned Coal Mines organized production and launched competitions with the goal of ensuring steel production. In addition to mining more coal to ensure the needs of steel production, the state-owned coal mines in the province also helped the steel plants and mines solve technical problems.

In this movement, the steel system and local industrial departments in Shanxi Province also adhered to the principle of simultaneous production and construction. Lingchuan County concentrated manpower to rush to build new furnaces, and built 29 native blast furnaces in two days, so that the daily output of pig iron in May was six times higher than in April. Recently, more than 100 native blast furnaces, native muffle furnaces, converters, and small blast furnaces in Yangcheng County have been put into production, and the county's pig iron output in May has doubled compared with April.

    让小煤窑、小铁矿、小炼铁厂、小水泥厂、小土铁路遍地开花
    福建向“五小”成群联合企业迈进
    黑龙江开展找矿、开矿、炼铁群众运动小高炉小矿山成批涌现
    山西狠抓煤、铁、矿、运钢铁产量全面提高
    本报福州30日电　福建省群众性大搞煤铁生产运动，已经形成高潮。5月份煤铁平均日产量比第一季度平均日产量分别提高48％和22％。
    进入5月，福建省各级党委普遍加强了煤铁战线的领导，成立了统一指挥机构，派出了数千名干部深入基层厂矿；同时，各地又有大批劳动力调往煤铁生产战线，充实生产第一线，因而有力地保证了煤铁产量的节节上升。
    福建省这次大搞煤铁生产中，十分强调一手抓高产一手抓“面积”，事实证明，这是保证煤铁生产迅速上升的关键。抓高产，就是要求现有小土群小洋群积极进行技术改造，提高利用系数，以保证提高单位面积产量和总产量。抓“面积”，就是要求提高开炉率，并迅速增建一大批一立方米三立方米的炉子。
    在这个思想的指导下，省、专区、县都根据省委的指示纷纷建立煤铁基地；有煤铁资源的社队，就大搞“小土群”；目前尚未发现煤铁资源的县和省直各机关也派出了大批干部、劳力、资金、设备，到有煤铁资源的地区，采取自办或与当地县、社合办的方式，建立煤铁生产基地。根据规划，各县都将在6月底以前建立起一个煤铁基地，并逐步发展成为“五小”成群（小煤窑、小铁矿、小炼铁厂、小水泥厂、小土铁路）的联合企业。
    在抓生产方面，各地都在认真作好燃料、矿石、交通运输工作，大搞采煤挖矿的群众运动，贯彻两条腿走路方针，一方面积极提高重点煤矿铁矿的产量，同时大抓煤、铁矿“小土群”，大搞小煤窑、小铁矿，开展群众性的报矿找矿运动，有煤有铁就挖。在运输方面，强调把现代运输工具和民间运输工具全部使用起来，推广运输“一条龙”的先进经验，迅速实现“龙网化”。同时加强简易公路和土铁路的建设，以保证煤铁生产需要。各地还普遍开展了技术革新和技术革命运动，加强原材料、燃料的综合利用，当前各地主要在推广煤气综合利用，和用矿渣发展水泥生产。
    城市在这次煤铁运动中，都加紧了炼钢和赶制矿山、冶炼设备，以适应煤铁生产迅速发展的需要。
    本报哈尔滨30日电　黑龙江省各地、各行业广泛开展了群众找矿、群众开采，大办钢铁“小洋群”的群众运动；使全省在原有九个中小型矿山、十二个“小洋群”炼铁点的基础上，出现了大小矿点遍及各地、小高炉成批涌现，并开始向“小洋联”方向发展的新局面。
    群众性找矿和报矿的活动，大大改变了黑龙江省冶金工业的面貌。据不完全统计，目前全省各地新发现的铁矿点达八十二处，其中有五十五处已经探明。在大规模开展群众性找矿、报矿的同时，钢铁“小洋群”也迅速发展起来了。目前，全省各地正在新建或准备新建以及利用原来停开的旧炉改建的新高炉点，已达四十九处，有小高炉约两百座左右。其中密山、宁安、勃利、嫩江等县新建或改建的小高炉，已炉火熊熊、欢畅地流出了铁水。
    黑龙江省在大办钢铁“小洋群”的工作中，还采取了由各业务系统的厅、局和某些县在自愿互利基础上，条条块块结合，协作找矿、建炉的办法，加快了钢铁“小洋群”的发展速度。协作的方式，有的由厅、县共同建立小高炉点，有的由某个市、县划给厅、局几个矿点或几个高炉等。行动较快的宁安县和水利厅合建的一个高炉，已投入了生产。
    据新华社太原29日电　正在热烈开展“定叫二季超一季”竞赛的山西省钢铁战线职工，干劲越来越大。最近半个月来，全省钢、钢材、生铁的日产量全面上升。5月15日到25日的平均日产量与前半月相比，钢平均提高9.7％，生铁平均提高12％，钢材平均提高40％。
    山西省钢铁系统这次开展的超产运动，声势之大犹如1958年的大炼钢铁运动。实行煤、铁、矿、运一把抓，是这次运动的显著特点。运动一开始，全省大钢铁厂和大洋群钢铁基地的党委书记、厂长、工程师等，就吃在炉旁，睡在炉旁，并且分别深入煤矿、矿山、运输部门，发动群众开展保钢运动。各个钢铁企业还普遍进行了关键排队，抓住薄弱环节首先解决。
    运输是太原钢铁公司薄弱环节中的最薄弱一环，这个公司的党委就决定首先集中火力攻克这一关。他们成立了总指挥部，一面发动运输部门职工开展技术革新，一面动员公司所属各厂大搞运输协作。由于运输效率的提高，这个公司的生铁日产量已比过去提高了13％。
    全省煤矿、矿山、铁道、公路等部门职工，都把保证钢铁生产放在首要地位；晋中、晋南、晋东南专区和太原市郊区的人民公社，也抽调人力帮助钢铁厂采矿、修土铁路。太原铁路局和山西国营煤矿都以保证钢铁生产为目标，组织生产和发动竞赛。全省国营煤矿除了多采煤炭保证钢铁生产需要外，还帮助各钢铁厂、矿山，解决技术问题。
    山西省钢铁系统和各地工业部门，在这个运动中还坚持了生产、建设同时并举。陵川县集中人力抢建新炉，两天建成土高炉二十九座，使5月份的生铁日产量比4月份提高六倍。阳城县最近有一百多座土高炉、土焖炉、转炉、小高炉投入生产，5月份全县生铁产量比4月份提高了一倍。
