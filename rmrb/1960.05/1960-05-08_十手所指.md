    The Direction Pointed to by the Jitte
    Yang Shuo
    On April 20, 1960, after the victorious conclusion of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, we flew from Africa to Moscow. Early in the morning, as I entered the restaurant, a Japanese friend handed me the newspaper. The headline news screamed: Syngman Rhee Conducts Massacre!
    The Chilean friend sitting across from me said, "That's great news, the South Korean people have risen up."
    The Japanese friend said, "The people everywhere, in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are rising up. The executioner's knife cannot extinguish the flames of revolution."
    On the contrary, if we compare revolution to fire, then the hot blood shed by the martyrs for the revolution is like oil, poured onto the fire, only making the flames of revolution burn even more fiercely. Bayonets will never frighten the people, but it is imperialism, colonialism, and those slavish, vile despots who are frightened in the face of the people. Look, isn't the walking corpse Syngman Rhee scared stiff, packing up his gold, silver, and valuables, and slinking away out of sight?
    Syngman Rhee is a boil, and it is certainly a good thing to cut him out. However, the root cause of the great disaster inflicted on the South Korean people has not been removed. There is an even greater culprit. Ten eyes are watching, ten fingers are pointing, and even if the US imperialism holds an invisibility cloak, it cannot conceal its monstrous crimes. If it weren't for hiding under the crotch of the American bandits, Syngman Rhee wouldn't be able to sit steady for even a second on his throne set on a volcano; if it weren't for the American bandits occupying South Korea, the three thousand li of Korean land wouldn't be half white and half black, half bright and half dark, plunging the South Korean people into a sea of ​​suffering. We will never forget the Korean War launched by the American bandits, which caused such terrible destruction to Korea. And today, when the South Korean people rise up to resist fascist tyranny, the American bandits are actually urgently transferring a Rhee puppet army division back to Seoul, handing the murderous knives to the executioners, and deliberately, when the South Korean people's struggle is intense, boasting that they will launch some "Honest John" missile. Whether you are "Honest John" or "Evil Uncle Sam," you are all just scarecrows, only good for scaring sparrows.
    The Korean people have an unbreakable desire: to peacefully reunify their motherland. The mountains of Korea stretch continuously from north to south; the waters of Korea flow through the whole country from south to north. No one can sever the mountains and rivers of Korea, and no one can stop the Korean people's desire to reunify their motherland. Today, although the Korean people are still divided into bright and dark sides, the fighting spirit of the North and South Korean people has long been united, soaring to the skies, forming a thunderous storm that sweeps away everything.
    This is not just the struggle of the Korean people. It should be said that this is the common struggle of all the people of the world against the most vicious enemy of the present. At the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, the Asian and African people voiced their strong and firm support for the Korean people's ardent desire for the reunification of North and South.
    Imperialism is, in fact, the root cause of all disasters in human life today, and the deadly enemy of world peace. Although the clown Syngman Rhee has rolled off the stage, the struggle is not over. Unless the germs of war are eradicated from the earth, and the imperialists are completely eliminated, humanity cannot be completely freed from darkness, hunger, and slavery.
    The flames of struggle are burning from South Korea; burning from Turkey; burning from Algeria; burning from Japan; burning from everywhere that is invaded by the plague of American imperialism. History has opened a new page, and more intense struggles lie ahead. American imperialism has been filled with evil and will be punished. No matter how it struggles, it will eventually die, and it must be resolutely, thoroughly, and completely eliminated by the people like flies, bedbugs, rats, and mosquitoes.

    十手所指
    杨朔
    1960年4月20日，在亚非人民团结大会胜利闭幕后，我们从非洲飞到莫斯科。清早晨，我一进餐厅，一位日本朋友把报纸递给我，头条新闻的大标题是：李承晚进行大屠杀！
    坐在我对面的智利朋友说：“很好的消息啊，南朝鲜人民起来了。”
    日本朋友说：“亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲，到处的人民都起来了。刽子手的屠刀是不能扑灭革命的火焰的。”
    恰恰相反，如果把革命比做火，那么，为革命而牺牲的烈士所流的热血就是油，泼到火上，只会使革命的火焰烧得更猛更烈。刺刀永远吓不坏人民，而在人民面前，吓坏的倒是帝国主义、殖民主义者和那些奴颜婢膝的独夫竖子。请看，行尸走肉的李承晚不是早吓得浑身像筛糠似的，收拾收拾金银细软，溜得不见影儿。
    李承晚是个脓疱，剜下去，固然是好事。可是，给南朝鲜人民造成莫大灾难的病根并未割掉。还有更大的罪魁祸首。十目所视，十手所指，美帝国主义就是拿着隐身草，也掩盖不住他的滔天大罪。要不是藏在美国强盗的胯褂下，李承晚连一分一秒也坐不稳他设在火山口上的宝座；要不是美国强盗侵占着南朝鲜，朝鲜那三千里江山就不会半白半黑，半明半暗，使南朝鲜人民陷在水深火热的浩劫之中。我们更不会忘记美国强盗所发动的侵朝战争，那对朝鲜曾经造成多么惨重的破坏啊。而在今天，当南朝鲜人民起而反抗法西斯暴政时，美国强盗竟将一个李伪军师团紧急调回汉城，把杀人的凶刀交给刽子手，还故意在南朝鲜人民斗争激烈的时候，扬言说要发射什么“诚实的约翰”导弹。管你是“诚实的约翰”，还是“恶毒的山姆大叔”，反正都是装模作样的稻草人，只能吓吓麻雀而已。
    朝鲜人民有一个坚不可摧的愿望：这就是和平统一自己的祖国。朝鲜的山，从北到南连绵不断；朝鲜的水，从南到北流贯全国。没有人能割断朝鲜的山水，也就没有人能阻挡得住朝鲜人民要求统一祖国的愿望。今天，尽管朝鲜人民还被隔断成明暗两面，南北朝鲜人民的斗志却早已团结一致，直薄云霄，形成横扫一切的雷风暴雨了。
    这也不仅是朝鲜人民的斗争。应该说，这是全世界人民对待当前最凶恶的敌人的共同斗争。在第二届亚非人民团结大会上，亚非人民就发出巨大的声音，明确而坚定地支持朝鲜人民要求南北统一的热烈愿望。
    帝国主义其实是现在人类生活中一切灾难的罪魁祸首，是世界和平的死敌。虽然丑角李承晚已经滚下场去，斗争并未结束。不从地球上连根铲掉战争的毒菌，把帝国主义者消除净尽，人类便不可能完全从黑暗、饥饿、奴役中挣脱出来。
    斗争的烈火从南朝鲜燃烧起来了；从土耳其燃烧起来了；从阿尔及利亚燃烧起来了；从日本燃烧起来了；从一切有美帝国主义这个瘟神侵占的地方燃烧起来了。历史已经揭开新的一页，更激烈的斗争还摆在前面。美帝国主义已经恶贯满盈了，不管它怎样挣扎，最后一定要死亡，一定要像苍蝇、臭虫、老鼠、蚊子一样被人民坚决、彻底、全部消灭掉。
