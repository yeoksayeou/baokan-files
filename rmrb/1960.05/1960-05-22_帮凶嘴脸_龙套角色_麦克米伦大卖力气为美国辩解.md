Xinhua News Agency, London, May 20th - British Prime Minister Macmillan, in a speech to the House of Commons today regarding the failure of the Four-Power Summit Conference, once again exonerated the United States for its acts of aggression and tried his best to conceal the truth about the West's sabotage of the summit.

Macmillan stubbornly portrayed Khrushchev's solemn statement at the Paris Conference as the reason for the conference's breakdown. He asserted that Khrushchev's protest was "difficult for the head of government of a country (referring to Eisenhower) to accept."

He also used the excuse that Eisenhower had vaguely mentioned on the 16th that the United States would "not continue" spy flights in the coming months, and claimed that the United States had made a "clear guarantee," and that the Soviet Union should be "largely satisfied." He even said: "After President Eisenhower's guarantee was made public, it invalidated any claim that the summit talks would be held under threat."

While defending the United States' aggressive policies, the British Prime Minister also portrayed himself as a "peace envoy," saying how he had worked hard to "save" the Four-Power Summit Conference.

Regarding the future situation, Macmillan's words indicated that Britain intends to continue to follow the United States' war and aggression policies. He emphasized the need to strengthen "cooperation" within the North Atlantic military aggression group, and said that the Western three countries had already "conducted very full preliminary talks" on this issue in Paris.

On the one hand, he stated that the British government would continue to implement a policy of arms expansion and war preparation. At the same time, his speech indicated that Britain would continue to play the "false peace" trick. He said that the West is "prepared to participate in peaceful negotiations on all outstanding international issues at any appropriate time in the future."

After Macmillan spoke, Gaitskell, the leader of the "opposition" Labour Party, expressed "gratitude" to Macmillan and indicated support for the Conservative government's intention to continue playing a double game. He said: "I believe the Prime Minister means that we should not make any changes in our attitude and policies, which is correct." He added: "Our policy must indeed be the same as before, constantly prepared and eager to obtain negotiated agreements, while maintaining our defenses and various alliances."

British Deputy Prime Minister and Home Secretary Butler said at a meeting held by the American Chamber of Commerce in London on the 18th: "Western politicians worked day and night in the face of the most likely situation to achieve constructive results, but this possibility has been overturned by one person." At the same time, he clamored that Western countries need "absolute unity" in the face of so-called "threats and intimidation."

    麦克米伦大卖力气为美国辩解
    据新华社伦敦20日电　英国首相麦克米伦今天在下院就四国政府首脑会议没有开成发表演说时，再一次为美国的侵略行为开脱罪责，并且竭力掩饰西方破坏首脑会议的真相。
    麦克米伦硬把赫鲁晓夫在巴黎会议上提出的严正声明说成是会议破裂的原因。他断言赫鲁晓夫提出的抗议是“一个国家的政府首脑（指艾森豪威尔）很难接受的”。
    他还借口艾森豪威尔在16日曾经含糊其词地谈到了所谓美国将在今后的几个月中“不继续”间谍飞行，而说什么美国已经提出了“明确的保证”，苏联也就应该“大体上得到满足”。他甚至说：“艾森豪威尔总统的保证公布以后，使所谓最高级谈判将在威胁之下举行的任何说法失去了根据。”
    这位英国首相在替美国侵略政策辩护的同时，还把自己描绘成一个“和平使者”，说他曾怎样为
  “挽救”四国政府首脑会议而奔走呼吁。
    在谈到今后的局势时，麦克米伦的话表明，英国打算继续追随美国的战争和侵略政策。他强调要加强北大西洋军事侵略集团内部的“合作”，并且说，关于这个问题，西方三国已经在巴黎“进行了非常充分的初步交谈”。
    他一方面表示英国政府将继续执行扩军备战政策，而同时，他的演说表明，英国将继续玩弄“假和平”的手法。他说，西方“准备在今后任何适宜的时候参加讨论一切悬而未决的国际问题的和平谈判”。
    在麦克米伦发言后，“反对党”工党领袖盖茨克尔对麦克米伦表示“感谢”，并且表示支持保守党政府打算继续耍两面手法的作法。他说：“我相信首相的意思是，我们不应当在我们的态度和政策上作任何改变，这是正确的。”他还补充说：“我们的政策必须确实像以前的一样，经常准备和渴望获得经谈判而达成的协议，同时保持我们的防御和种种联盟。”
    英国副首相兼内政大臣巴特勒18日在伦敦美国商会举行的一次会议上说：“西方政治家们在面临最有可能取得建设性结果的情况下曾经夜以继日地为此奔走，可是这种可能性已被一个人推翻了”。他同时叫嚷，西方国家在所谓“威胁和恫吓面前”有“绝对团结”的必要。
