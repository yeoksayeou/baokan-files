Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th: Representatives of the Japanese Communist Party, Socialist Party, and Democratic Socialist Party met with Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke on the afternoon of the 25th, strongly demanding that he resign and dissolve the House of Representatives.

Those who met with Kishi Nobusuke included Nosaka Sanzo, Chairman of the Communist Party, and Iwama Masao, a Communist Party member of the House of Councillors; Asanuma Inejirō, Chairman of the Socialist Party, and Eda Saburō, Secretary-General; and Mizutani Chozaburo, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party's Diet members group, and Sone Eki, Secretary-General. Representatives of these parties pursued Kishi Nobusuke's responsibility for using violence in the House of Representatives to illegally "pass" the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Kishi Nobusuke adopted an arrogant attitude in responding to the demands of the opposition parties. He said that he would never succumb to pressure from outside the Diet. Kishi Nobusuke said, "I do not want to resign. Newspapers cannot represent true public opinion. As for demonstrations, that is only something done by a minority of people."

During the meeting, Kishi Nobusuke asked the Socialist Party to "cooperate" in "normalizing" the Diet, which had been stalled due to the opposition parties' boycott. Asanuma rejected Kishi Nobusuke's request. He said that as long as the government did not state its attitude on the basic issues of dissolving the Diet and Kishi Nobusuke's resignation, the Socialist Party would not agree.

Kishi Nobusuke also said to the Socialist Party representatives that "Socialist Party leader Asanuma's request to the US government to cancel President Eisenhower's visit to Japan is extremely regrettable."

After the meeting, Asanuma told reporters that it proved Kishi Nobusuke had no conscience. Asanuma emphasized, "Now is not the time to hold talks with Kishi Nobusuke. From now on, we will arouse public opinion and create a huge upsurge against him to exert enormous pressure on him."

    追究用暴力非法“通过”日美条约的罪责
    野坂和浅沼等面斥岸信介
    岸信介态度蛮横蔑视舆论表示要与人民敌对到底
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本共产党、社会党、民主社会党的代表25日下午分别会见岸信介首相时，极力要求他辞职和解散众议院。
    会见岸信介的有共产党主席野坂参三和共产党参议院议员岩间正男，社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎和书记长江田三郎，民主社会党国会议员团团长水谷长三郎和书记长曾弥益。这些政党的代表们追究了岸信介在众议院施用暴力非法“通过”新日美“安全条约”的责任。
    岸信介在答复反对党的要求时采取蛮横的态度。他说，他决不向国会以外的压力屈服。岸信介说，“我不想辞职。报纸不能代表真正的舆论。至于示威，那只是一部分人干的事。”
    岸信介在会谈中，要求社会党“合作”，使由于反对党抵制而陷于停顿状态的国会“正常化”。浅沼拒绝了岸信介的要求。他说，只要政府一天不表明对于解散国会和岸信介辞职这些基本问题的态度，社会党就一天不答应。
    岸信介在同社会党代表会谈时还说什么“社会党领袖浅沼要求美国政府取消艾森豪威尔总统对日本的访问，是十分令人遗憾的。”
    会谈后，浅沼对记者说，事情证明岸信介毫无天良。浅沼强调说，“现在不是同岸信介举行会谈的时候。从今以后，我们将唤起舆论掀起反对他的巨大高潮，来对他施加巨大的压力。”
