Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 21st: Many Indian newspapers have condemned the United States' blatant sabotage of the Four-Power Summit.

    The Tamil newspaper "People's Power" stated in its May 20th editorial that it was the American imperialists who caused the failure of the Four-Power Summit. It emphasized that "the American militarist group should be blamed entirely."

    The editorial stated that the United States has made provocations against socialist countries its national policy. People's China has already reminded the world's people of the ninety-six violations of its airspace and territorial waters by the United States. It has been revealed that American aircraft, when wantonly invading the airspace of socialist countries, also passed through Indian airspace. All of this shows that the United States' infringement upon the sovereignty of other countries disregards morality or international law.

    The editorial warned that American puppet regimes in Asia must see the rogue militaristic conspiracies of the United States more clearly.

    The editorial pointed out that when the powerful Soviet Union is talking about peace and fighting for peace, this is not a sign of its weakness. Khrushchev's firm attitude shows that American spy planes cannot intimidate the socialist camp and make it submit.

    The recent issue of the Urdu weekly "People's Century" published an editorial stating that the whole world condemns American espionage activities. It said that since American planes conducted spy flights in Soviet airspace, the United States "should be responsible for the act of aggression. This action shows that the United States attempts to create tension in international relations, be hostile to the Soviet Union, and prepare to attack the Soviet Union."

    The editorial pointed out that the Soviet Union is technically and scientifically more advanced than the United States. At the same time, today the defense strength of the socialist world is so strong that it can teach all aggressors and adventurers, large and small, a lesson.

    A recent issue of the "Delhi Times" weekly said in a commentary that the Indian people believe that the responsibility for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit lies entirely with the United States government.

    The "Blitz" weekly, published today, stated in its editorial, "It is now clear that the Paris summit was dealt a fatal blow on the morning of May 1st when an American spy plane took off from Peshawar and violated Soviet airspace."

    A recent issue of the "India" weekly said, "Eisenhower's statement on spy flights is not only an admission but also a challenge to Soviet sovereignty, a challenge that Khrushchev could neither ignore nor avoid."

    印度许多报刊发表评论
    斥美国流氓军国主义阴谋
    据新华社新德里21日电　印度许多报刊谴责美帝国主义明目张胆地破坏了四国首脑会议。
    泰米尔文“人民力量报”在20日的社论中指出，是美帝国主义者使四国首脑会议遭到失败。它强调说，“完全应该责怪美国军国主义集团”。
    社论说，美国是把对社会主义国家进行挑衅活动作为它的国策的。人民中国已经提醒全世界人民注意美国对它的领空和领海进行了九十六次侵犯。据揭露，美国飞机对社会主义国家的领空进行蛮横的侵犯时还通过印度的领空。所有这一切表明，美国对其他国家主权的侵犯是不顾道义或国际法的。
    社论警告说，美国在亚洲的傀儡政权必须对美国流氓的军国主义阴谋看得明智些。
    社论指出，当强大的苏联在谈论和平和为和平而奋斗的时候，这并不是它软弱的表示。赫鲁晓夫坚决的态度表明，美国间谍飞机是不可能威吓社会主义阵营，并使它屈服的。
    最近一期乌尔都文“人民世纪”周刊发表社论说，全世界都谴责美国的间谍活动。它说，既然美国飞机在苏联领空进行间谍飞行，美国“就应对侵略行动负责。这个行动说明了，美国企图制造国际关系中的紧张局势，敌视苏联，并准备进攻苏联。”
    社论指出，苏联在技术上和科学上比美国先进得多，同时，今天社会主义世界的防御力量是这样强大，它可以给一切大大小小的侵略者和冒险家以教训。
    最近一期“德里时报”周刊在评论中说，印度人民相信，破坏四国首脑会议的责任完全在美国政府身上。
    今天出版的“闪电”周报发表社论说，“现在很明显，巴黎最高级会议在5月1日清晨美国间谍飞机从白沙瓦起飞和侵犯苏联领空的时候，就受到了致命的打击。”
    最近一期的“印度”周刊说，“艾森豪威尔关于间谍飞行的声明，不仅是一种承认，而且是对苏联主权的一种挑战，赫鲁晓夫既不能无视这种挑战，也不能避开这种挑战。”
