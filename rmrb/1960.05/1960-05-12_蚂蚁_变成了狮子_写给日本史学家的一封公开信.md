"Ants" Turned into Lions
-- An Open Letter to Japanese Historians
Jian Bozan

Respected Japanese Historians:

As you and your people across the country throw yourselves into the historically significant and serious struggle against the ratification of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, please allow me, as your friend, to extend my highest respect to you and, through you, to the struggling Japanese people.

In writing to you, I cannot help but recall the numerous friendly meetings I had with you during my visit to your great country in 1955. The deepest impression left on me by these meetings was our common language: Sino-Japanese friendship, world peace, and the independence and democracy of Japan.

I still cannot forget that when we visited Nara, the famous ancient cultural city of Japan, we struck the bell of peace at Todai-ji Temple in Nara. Respected friends, we have studied history, and we know that peace has never been struck out with bells in history. However, any voice of peace is a protest against bugles, a protest against the creators and organizers of war—U.S. imperialism—and a protest against the reviving Japanese militarism.

What should arouse serious vigilance in the people of China and Japan is that in recent years we have no longer heard the bell of peace struck at Todai-ji Temple. What we hear are the bugles of U.S. imperialism. In recent years, U.S. imperialism has been clamoring for war everywhere in the world, especially in Japan. They are excavating the forces of war from Japan’s historical excrement, remnants, and garbage heaps, even digging up those buried corpses from their graves to be their agents. Nobusuke Kishi is a zombie dragged out of the grave by U.S. imperialism, yet the U.S. has placed this zombie in the seat of the Japanese government's prime minister. Respected friends, placing the corpse of a war criminal in the seat of the Japanese prime minister, what other explanation is there except that it marks U.S. imperialism's intention to drag Japan to the brink of war, to revive the heinous Japanese militarism, and to drag the Japanese people onto the road of destruction?

Recently, this American gigolo, in order to ingratiate himself with his master, has been playing his reactionary role more and more wildly. The Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty he signed is a challenge to Japan, to Asia, and to the peace-loving people of the world, especially to China. Recently, Nobusuke Kishi again issued warmongering cries, saying that there are currently no conditions for concluding a mutual non-aggression treaty, and even dreaming of interfering with China's Taiwan. This "trained Swiss falcon" actually wants to play the role of "Napoleon's eagle," but we can recognize that he is still a "falcon."

Respected friends, you know that the Chinese people deeply love peace, but they are also not afraid of war. Only a madman would think that our defense of peace is out of fear of war.

I would also like to say that when we visited Hiroshima, the first city in the world to suffer the disaster of an atomic bomb, we laid wreaths with heavy hearts at the foot of the monument erected on the ruins of Hiroshima to commemorate the atomic bomb disaster. We also know that a wreath cannot stop an atomic bomb war. However, we still placed wreaths at the foot of this monument in order to protest atomic warfare and nuclear weapons warfare. Unexpectedly, Nobusuke Kishi happily sees this monument built with the lives of countless peace-loving people, and welcomes the American atomic bombs or nuclear weapons that slaughtered the Japanese people as sacred objects to Japan, attempting to use them to arm the reborn Japanese militarism. Respected friends, I don’t know what you think about this, but in my opinion, the name Nobusuke Kishi means disaster for the Japanese people.

I would also like to mention that I still cannot forget what a respectable Japanese historian (regrettably, I have forgotten his name) said at a gathering. He said, "Even if we are some ants, we will also bore some holes in the dam built with Japanese soil that blocks Sino-Japanese friendship, so that this dam will collapse before us." These few words show how much Japanese historians, like us, cherish Sino-Japanese friendship, and also show how difficult the situation of Japanese historians was at that time.

But Agesilaus answered King Artaxerxes well: "I am seen as an ant by you, but one day, I will become a lion." Now the day Agesilaus longed for has arrived. You are no longer ants; you have become lions.

In the newspapers, I saw the news of ten million Japanese people rising up in action, saw that the patriotic intellectuals, professors, writers, and students of Japan have already stood on the side of the great Japanese working class, participating in the largest-scale demonstration in Japanese history, and saw some famous Japanese cities that I visited in 1955, such as Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Kyushu, and other cities that I did not visit, all stirred up the roaring waves against the ratification of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The Japanese people roared, the cities boiled, and the magnificent fighting ranks swept away all obstacles on their way forward like volcanic lava. Let the volcano erupt more lava, and bury the maids of Wall Street who hold American brooms to sweep away the lava and their masters together in the lava!

In recent newspapers, I also saw that the Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" issued a greater call to the people of Japan, calling on the Japanese people to pursue the victory, overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, and tear up the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. I also saw that the Japanese people decided to launch a more powerful nationwide struggle from May 9th to 26th. Respected friends, I believe you have dropped your pens, stretched out your fists, and walked to the streets with the people of the whole country, to your parliament. Let U.S. imperialism and its running dog Nobusuke Kishi tremble before you!

Respected friends, the peace-loving people of the world, especially the people of China, are watching your magnificent battle ranks with wide eyes, and are amplifying their voices to shout for your just struggle. The people of the Chinese capital and other cities have held angry demonstrations one after another to support your struggle.

Respected friends, the struggles of you and the people of your country, the struggles of the people of South Korea, and the struggles of the people of Turkey have already shaken the foundation of U.S. imperialism's rule in Asia and have unveiled a new scene in the world history of the 1960s.

### “蚂蚁”变成了狮子——写给日本史学家的一封公开信

    “蚂蚁”变成了狮子
    ——写给日本史学家的一封公开信
    翦伯赞尊敬的日本史学家们：
    当你们和你们全国人民一起投身于反对批准日美军事同盟条约这一具有历史性的严重的斗争的时候，作为你们的朋友，请允许我向你们并通过你们向斗争中的日本人民致以崇高的敬意。
    在写信给你们的时候，我不能不回想到我在1955年访问你们伟大的国家的时候和你们举行的无数次的友好会谈。在这些会谈中，留给我的最深的印象是我们之间的共同言语：中日友好，世界和平和日本的独立、民主。
    我至今不能忘记，当我们访问奈良这个有名的日本文化古城的时候，我们曾经在奈良的东大寺敲响了和平的钟声。尊敬的朋友，我们学过历史，我们知道在历史上没有用钟声敲出来的和平，但任何和平的声音，都是对军号的抗议，对战争的制造者、组织者美帝国主义的抗议，对正在复活的日本军国主义的抗议。
    应该引起中日两国人民严重警惕的是这几年来我们再也听不到东大寺敲出的和平钟声，我们听得到的是美帝国主义的军号。近年来，美帝国主义在世界各地，特别在日本，到处发出战争的叫嚣，他们从日本的历史排泄物、残屑、垃圾堆中去发掘战争的力量，甚至从坟墓里去发掘那些被埋葬了的死尸作为他们的代理人。岸信介就是美帝国主义从坟墓中拖出来的一具僵尸，然而美帝却把这个僵尸放置在日本政府首相的座位上。尊敬的朋友，把一个战犯的尸体放置在日本首相的座位上，这除了标志着美帝国主义要把日本拖到战争的边缘，要复活万恶的日本军国主义，要把日本人民拖上毁灭的道路，还有什么其他的解释呢？
    最近以来，这个美国的面首为了献媚于他的主人，愈来愈狂妄地发挥他的反动作用，他签订的日美军事同盟条约，就是向日本，向亚洲，向全世界和平人民的挑战，特别是向中国的挑战。最近岸信介又发出了好战的叫嚣，他说在目前还没有缔结互不侵犯条约的条件，甚至梦想染指中国的台湾，这个“受了训练的瑞士的鹞子”竟然想扮演“拿破仑的飞鹰”，但是我们认得出他还是一个“鹞子”。
    尊敬的朋友，你们是知道中国人民是酷爱和平的，但也是不怕战争的，只有疯子才认为我们保卫和平是害怕战争。
    我还想说到的是，在我们访问广岛这个全世界第一个遭受原子弹灾难的城市的时候，我们曾经带着沉重的心情把花圈放在树立在广岛废墟上的纪念原子弹灾难的纪念碑的脚下。我们也知道一个花圈不能制止原子弹的战争，然而我们仍然把花圈放在这个纪念碑脚下，为的是对原子战争、核武器战争提出抗议。想不到岸信介却满意地看到这座用无数和平人民的生命建筑起来的纪念碑，并且把这种屠杀过日本人民的美国原子弹或核武器当作圣物欢迎到日本来，企图用它来武装再生的日本军国主义。尊敬的朋友，我不知道你们对此作何感想，在我看来，岸信介这个名字就意味着日本人民的灾难。
    我还想提到的是我至今不能忘记一位可敬的日本史学家（很遗憾我忘记了他的名字）在一次集会上所说的话。他说：“就算我们是一些蚂蚁，我们也要在用日本泥土筑成的遮断中日友好关系的堤坝上穿凿一些窟窿，让这个堤坝在我们面前崩溃。”这几句话表明了日本史学家和我们一样是如何珍视中日的友谊，也表明了当时的日本史学家的处境是如何艰苦。
    但是阿盖西雷回答国王亚奇斯拉的话说得好：“我被你看成蚂蚁，但总有一天，我将变成狮子。”现在阿盖西雷盼望的日子到了，你们已经不是蚂蚁，你们已经变成了狮子。
    在报上，我看到了日本一千万人奋起行动的消息，看到了日本爱国的知识分子、教授、作家、学生，已经和伟大的日本工人阶级站在一边，参加了日本历史上空前未有的最大规模的示威游行的行列，看到我在1955年访问过的一些日本的有名的城市，东京、大阪、京都、九州等城市，还有我没有访问过的城市，都卷起了反对批准日美军事同盟条约的洪涛巨浪。日本的人民怒吼了，城市沸腾了，雄伟的斗争行列像火山熔岩一样冲刷着它前进道路上的一切障碍物。让火山喷出更多的熔岩，把那些拿着美国扫帚来扫除熔岩的华尔街的女仆和她们的主人一齐埋葬在熔岩之中吧！
    在最近的报上，我又看到日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”向日本全国的人民发出更伟大的号召，它号召日本人民乘胜追击，打倒岸信介内阁，撕毁日美军事同盟条约。我还看到了日本人民决定从5月9日到26日展开更加强大的全国规模的斗争。尊敬的朋友们，我相信你们已经掉了你们的笔，伸出了你们的拳头和全国人民一起走向街头，走向你们的国会。让美帝国主义和他的走狗岸信介在你们面前发抖吧！
    尊敬的朋友，全世界爱好和平的人民，特别是中国的人民都睁大了眼睛望着你们的雄伟的战斗的行列，都放大了喉咙为着你们的正义的斗争而呐喊。中国首都及其它城市的人民，为了支援你们的斗争，先后举行了愤怒的示威。
    尊敬的朋友，你们和你们全国人民的斗争，南朝鲜人民的斗争，土耳其人民的斗争，已经摇撼了美帝国主义在亚洲统治的基础，已经揭开了二十世纪六十年代世界史的新场面了。
