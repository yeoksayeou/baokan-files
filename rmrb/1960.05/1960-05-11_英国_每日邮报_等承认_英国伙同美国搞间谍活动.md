Xinhua News Agency, London, May 9th: While the British Foreign Office is evading commenting on the U.S. plane's intrusion into Soviet airspace for espionage activities, British newspapers today admitted that the British Air Force is also working with the United States to sneak into the airspace of the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries for espionage activities. The "Daily Mail" said that "the British photographic reconnaissance unit is under the jurisdiction of Bomber Command," and this unit's high-altitude aircraft "frequently fly along the Iron Curtain, creating radar maps extending one hundred and fifty miles into (the territory of Eastern European socialist countries). Aircraft with special missions also penetrate deep into Russia to take precise target maps for the 'V' bomber force."

The "Daily Express" said: "The U.S. Air Force and the British Royal Air Force exchange all intelligence obtained from reconnaissance activities, whether it is intelligence obtained by radar or by photography."

The "Daily Herald" also pointed out that British aircraft "penetrate 150 miles into Communist countries' territory along the German (West German) front to take photos." The British Air Force Ministry refused to comment on the above news published by the newspapers.

    英国“每日邮报”等承认
    英国伙同美国搞间谍活动
    新华社伦敦9日电　正当英国外交部回避对于美国飞机侵入苏联领空从事间谍活动一事发表意见的时候，英国报纸今天承认，英国空军也同美国合伙，潜入苏联和东欧社会主义国家的领空进行间谍活动。“每日邮报”说，“英国的照相侦察部队是由轰炸机司令部管辖的”，这个部队的高空飞行飞机“经常沿着铁幕飞行，制作深入（东欧社会主义国家国境）一百五十英里的雷达地图。负有特别使命的飞机还深入俄国去摄取供‘V’式轰炸机部队使用的精确目标地图。”
    “每日快报”说：“美国空军和英国皇家空军交换从侦察活动所获得的一切情报，不论是由雷达绘制的还是由摄影得来的情报。”
    “每日先驱报”也指出，英国的飞机“沿德国（西德）前线深入共产党国家领土一百五十英里去摄取照片”。英国空军部对报纸登载的上述消息拒绝发表评论。
