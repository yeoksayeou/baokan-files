Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 28th – The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement this afternoon refuting the slanderous statement made by U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Douglas MacArthur II, against the Japanese Socialist Party.

The Socialist Party announced that it would not retract the statement made by Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma that "American imperialism is the enemy of Japan."

MacArthur II, in a statement issued on the 24th, slandered that the Socialist Party's request for Eisenhower to cancel his visit to Japan was for the purpose of "propaganda." He also openly demanded that Asanuma retract that statement during a meeting with him that evening. In its statement, the Socialist Party pointed out that MacArthur II's statement was an "unfriendly statement" and propaganda that damaged the reputation of the Socialist Party.

The Socialist Party's statement pointed out that MacArthur II's one-sided support for the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet was to exert a certain degree of influence on the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

The Socialist Party also pointed out that it had no intention of retracting or revising Asanuma's statement that "American imperialism is the enemy of Japan."

The Socialist Party expressed dissatisfaction with the Kishi Nobusuke government's decision on the 27th to proceed with U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan as planned, despite the opposition of the people. It decided to request the Kishi Nobusuke government to "fully consider the current situation in Japan and reconsider" this issue carefully.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 28th – Representatives of the Kansai Region Joint Struggle Conference to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty" delivered a letter of protest to the U.S. Embassy in Japan yesterday, demanding that the U.S. Congress not ratify the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," immediately withdraw U-2 spy planes from Japan, and cancel the U.S. President's planned visit to Japan.

Prior to this, representatives from Miyagi Prefecture, Aichi Prefecture, and Nagano Prefecture delivered letters of protest to the U.S. Embassy on the afternoon of the 26th, expressing their firm opposition to Eisenhower's visit to Japan, opposing the illegal interference of the United States in Japan's internal affairs, and demanding that the U.S. Congress not ratify the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
