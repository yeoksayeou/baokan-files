After the Kishi Nobusuke group staged a fascist farce in the Japanese House of Representatives, they claimed that the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty had been "approved" by the Japanese House of Representatives and expressed "unspeakable joy." The Washington authorities also hurriedly expressed their "satisfaction" with this. What the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are "delighted" and "satisfied" with is that they believe they have successfully imposed the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, which is a major sign of the revival of Japanese militarism, on the Japanese people. However, anyone can see that this aggressive treaty has not been approved by the Japanese people at all, and never will be!

The so-called "approval" by the Kishi Nobusuke group was an extremely absurd and shameless farce. The Kishi Nobusuke group struggled desperately in the Japanese House of Representatives for eighty days to approve the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, but failed to escape its predicament and achieve the goal of having the treaty approved by the House of Representatives. On the night of May 19th, this small group of reactionaries brazenly and illegally ended the deliberation of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and directed their pre-arranged accomplices to fight and beat the Socialist Party members who opposed them. They even dispatched five hundred policemen and used violence to drive all the Socialist and Communist Party members out of the venue. Then, they hastily held a so-called "plenary meeting" attended only by members of the Kishi Nobusuke group within the Liberal Democratic Party. In less than fifteen minutes, they claimed to have passed the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" that the Japanese people were determined to oppose. This farce was so disgraceful that not only were the members of the Democratic Socialist Party unwilling to play supporting roles, but even some enlightened people within the Liberal Democratic Party avoided it. Kenzo Matsumura, Tanzan Ishibashi, Takeo Miki, and Ichiro Kono, among others, did not participate in the vote. The fascist methods adopted by the Kishi Nobusuke group in the parliament, such as using violence to drive out opposition party members and suppressing the dissenting opinions of its own party members, are unprecedented in Japan and rare in the world. How can the Japanese people recognize such so-called "approval"?

The farce directed by the Kishi Nobusuke group was staged under the direct direction of the United States. The reason why the United States did not hesitate to let the Kishi Nobusuke group brazenly tear up the false banner of so-called "parliamentary democracy" of the bourgeoisie and illegally pass the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty by the most barbaric means is inseparable from the United States' recent entire plan to intensify war preparations. As everyone knows, the United States has recently been accelerating its pace of arms expansion and war preparation. After deliberately undermining the four-power summit conference, the United States is comprehensively carrying out activities to intensify international tensions and accelerating the implementation of its policies of aggression and war. According to Western news agencies, the United States is preparing to further strengthen West Germany's armaments. The North Atlantic Group has threatened to substantially revise the Paris Agreement recently, lift the last bit of restrictions on West Germany's rearmament, and allow West Germany to revive militarist forces more freely. A large number of American generals will go to West Berlin this month to plot new conspiracies to strengthen West Germany's military strength. Accelerating the revival of another source of war in the Far East is certainly an important part of the U.S. war preparation plan. Recently, due to the increasingly strong opposition of the Japanese people and the people of the world to the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the U.S. ruling group could not conceal its anxiety about the Japanese Diet's delay in approving the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. After the crime of the U.S. spy plane intruding into Soviet airspace for provocation was exposed, the Washington authorities were even more worried that this would create new and serious obstacles to the conspiracy of the Japanese Diet to approve the treaty. According to Japan's Kyodo News, the U.S. government recently questioned the Kishi Nobusuke government: "The U.S. Congress is preparing to end its deliberations by the end of June. Can the Japanese Diet pass the new Security Treaty?" This questioning reflects the anxiety of the U.S. ruling group. The United States single-handedly undermined the four-power summit conference. In the eyes of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, this was a great opportunity to force the Japanese Diet to pass the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. Saburo Hirano, a member of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, openly said that the failure of the four-power summit conference created the "international political atmosphere" needed for Kishi Nobusuke to have the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty approved. United Press International even did not conceal that the Kishi Nobusuke group was "happy" about the United States undermining the four-power summit conference. Obviously, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries want to take advantage of the international tensions caused by the U.S. undermining the four-power summit conference to launch a "surprise attack" on the Japanese people, and force the Diet to "approve" the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty at all costs, so that Japanese militarist forces can openly accelerate nuclear armaments, incorporate Japan into the U.S. atomic strategy system, and make the whole of Japan a U.S. nuclear war base.

Accompanying the Kishi Nobusuke group's manipulation of the Diet to forcibly pass the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty will inevitably be the further intensification of the U.S. and Japanese imperialism's conspiracy to carry out aggression and expansion in Asia. As everyone knows, the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty stipulates that Japan can not only expand its armaments indefinitely and accelerate nuclear armaments, but also send troops abroad to jointly fight with the U.S. military. According to the Kishi Nobusuke group's interpretation of the areas to which the treaty applies, its spearhead of aggression is directed at China, the Soviet Union, and various Asian countries. Since the signing of this treaty, even though it has not been approved by the Japanese Diet, the Kishi Nobusuke group has been constantly intensifying the enhancement of the military strength of Japanese militarism. The figures for Japan's arms expansion in 1960 announced by Munenori Akagi, director of the "Defense Agency" of the Kishi Nobusuke government, on March 11 show that the speed of Japan's arms expansion has been greatly accelerated, and this year Japan's military strength will be roughly close to the original 1965 target. At present, the Japanese "Defense Agency" is also stepping up the formulation of the "Second Long-Term Plan for Enriching Defense Capabilities" in order to accelerate the implementation of nuclear armaments in accordance with the requirements of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The United States is also using this treaty signed with the Kishi Nobusuke group to redeploy and strengthen the network of U.S. aggression military bases in Japan. After the implementation of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries will inevitably more openly step up arms expansion and war preparation under the guise of so-called "security guarantee" and "joint cooperation," making Japan a U.S. nuclear war base for aggression in the Far East. The fact is very obvious that if the United States launches a war, Japan, as a U.S. atomic base, will inevitably be the first to suffer a devastating counterattack. Recently, due to the use of Japanese bases by U.S. military aircraft for espionage activities against the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has issued a serious warning to Japan. It is also not difficult to understand that because the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries collude with each other and step up preparations for a war of aggression, the first to suffer will certainly be the Japanese people. The Japanese people, who have suffered deeply from the scourge of Japanese militarism and the disasters of the war of aggression, certainly cannot accept the terrible fate arranged for them by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, and certainly cannot allow the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty to drive them into the abyss of war!

Not only that, but the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty will allow the U.S. military to occupy Japan for a long time and strengthen the U.S. control over Japan in military, political, and economic aspects. Since the end of the war, the Japanese people have suffered from the oppression and bullying of the U.S. occupation, and the sovereignty of the country has been greatly damaged. The implementation of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty will put Japan in a more humiliating position, which is of course also intolerable to the Japanese people who demand independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality.

The facts of the past year or so have fully demonstrated that the Japanese people's will to oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty is very strong. They have launched sixteen united actions against the treaty, each larger in scale and more magnificent in momentum than the previous one. More than 12 million petitions have been submitted to the Diet from various places, and more than 13.5 million people have signed to oppose the ratification of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The Japanese people have long firmly stated that regardless of whether the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty is ratified by the Diet, they will definitely persist in the struggle to crush this aggressive treaty. The Kishi Nobusuke group's forcing the Diet to approve the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has aroused the unparalleled anger of the Japanese people. A massive movement to crush the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and dissolve the Diet is unfolding throughout Japan. Following the rally of 100,000 people in Tokyo on the 20th to declare the treaty invalid, workers and students shouted "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke government" around the Diet, more than 20,000 representatives from various parts of Japan held a large-scale demonstration in Tokyo on the 21st. They not only put forward "Oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance!" "The Kishi Nobusuke cabinet must resign immediately!" and also demonstrated in front of the U.S. Embassy, demanding "U.S. U-2 jets must withdraw from Japan immediately!" "Oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan!" and shouted "Yankees go home!". Various Japanese political parties and groups have also issued statements, angrily protesting the Kishi Nobusuke group's atrocities of forcibly passing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The Japanese Socialist Party announced: "We deny all decisions of the Liberal Democratic Party. We oppose their dictatorial rule, we want to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and we demand the immediate dissolution of the Diet." On the 21st, the Socialist Party members of both houses passed a resolution demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the resignation of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ichiro Kiyose. The Japanese Communist Party called on all Japanese people to strengthen their struggle until they overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government, dissolve the Diet, and crush the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and pointed out: "The real struggle has only just begun." The General Council of Trade Unions and the "Security Treaty Criticism Association" and other groups also stated that they do not recognize this so-called "approval" by the Kishi Nobusuke group. The Democratic Socialist Party also stated that it believes that the new "Security Treaty" "passed" by the House of Representatives and the resolution to extend the Diet session are invalid. Even within Kishi Nobusuke's Liberal Democratic Party, there are many enlightened people who disagree with the extremely barbaric practices of the Kishi Nobusuke group. According to a report by Mainichi Broadcasting Corporation on the 20th, members of the Liberal Democratic Party's Miki-Matsumura faction and Ishibashi faction, who have always advocated careful deliberation of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," "expressed severe criticism of the forced measures taken by Kishi Nobusuke." Hayato Ikeda, Minister of International Trade and Industry of the Kishi Nobusuke government, also believed that the Kishi Nobusuke group's "approach was too extreme" and asked it to "clarify the responsibility of the executive agency." The Kishi Nobusuke group attempted to extinguish the flames of the Japanese people's struggle by forcibly approving the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty with a fait accompli, but the result was to make the Japanese people's anger burn more fiercely; the Kishi Nobusuke group drove the opposition party members out of the Diet to create so-called "unanimous passage," but it could not stop the parties and groups representing the will of the Japanese people from opposing this traitorous treaty in a more powerful way. The Kishi Nobusuke group is now more isolated than ever. Not long ago, the Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Asahi Shimbun" pointed out that "Prime Minister Kishi is sitting on a time bomb." Now, because the Kishi Nobusuke group has thoroughly exposed its ferocious face of resolutely opposing the people, the moment when the time bomb under Kishi Nobusuke explodes is getting closer. The Japanese people are continuing their efforts and carrying the struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous government and the American aggressors through to the end, until final victory.

The resurrection of Japanese militarism and Japan's open participation in the U.S. aggressive military bloc are not only related to the fate of the Japanese people, but also related to the peace of Asia and the world. The Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and for independence, peace, democracy, neutrality is by no means isolated. It is part of the common struggle of the people of various Asian countries who have been ravaged by Japanese militarism to oppose aggression and safeguard peace and security in the Far East. The Japanese people's struggle will surely be supported by the people of various Asian countries.

The Chinese people have always supported the Japanese people's just struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality, and regard the Japanese people's struggle as support for the Chinese people. In this common struggle, we will always encourage and support each other. Chairman Mao said when he met with Japanese friends visiting China on May 14: "The Japanese people are very promising. The Chinese people have firmly supported, are supporting, and will continue to firmly support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle." This is the will of 650 million Chinese people. Let us unite, shoulder to shoulder, for the peace and security of Japan, China, Asia, and the world, fight together, oppose U.S. and Japanese imperialism, and fight to the end to overthrow the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty!

    把斗争进行到底！
    岸信介集团在日本国会众议院中演出了一幕法西斯丑剧之后，说是日美军事同盟条约已经经过日本国会众议院“批准”了，而且表示“不胜欢欣”。华盛顿当局也急忙对此表示“感到满意”。美日反动派所“欢欣”和“满意”的是，他们认为已经成功地把作为日本军国主义复活的重大标志的日美军事同盟条约强加到日本人民的头上了。但是，谁都可以看得见，这个侵略性的条约根本没有得到日本人民的批准，也永远不会得到日本人民的批准！
    岸信介集团的所谓“批准”，是一幕极端荒唐无耻的丑剧。岸信介集团在日本国会众议院中为批准日美军事同盟条约进行了八十天的死命挣扎，并没有能摆脱它的困境，达到使这个条约获得众议院批准的目的。这一小撮反动派竟于5月19日午夜悍然非法结束对日美军事同盟条约的审议，并且指挥他们预先布置的党羽大打出手，殴打反对他们的社会党议员，甚至出动五百名警察，用暴力把全体社会党和共产党议员赶出会场，然后，匆忙举行了只有自由民主党内岸信介集团清一色的议员参加的所谓“全体会议”，前后不到十五分钟，就算是把日本人民誓死反对的日美“安全条约”通过了。这幕丑剧是如此的见不得人，以致不仅民主社会党的议员不愿充当配角，连自由民主党的一些有识之士也退避三舍，松村谦三、石桥湛山、三木武夫和河野一郎等就没有参加表决。岸信介集团这种在议会中用暴力赶走反对党议员、压制本党议员的反对意见而采取的法西斯手段，在日本是史无前例的，在世界也是少见的。日本人民怎么能够承认这样的所谓“批准”呢？
    岸信介集团主演的这幕丑剧，是在美国直接导演之下演出的。美国所以不惜让岸信介集团悍然撕毁资产阶级的所谓“议会民主”的假招牌，用最野蛮的手段非法通过日美军事同盟条约，是同美国最近整个加紧准备战争的计划分不开的。大家知道，最近以来美国一直在加紧扩军备战的步调。在它蓄意破坏了四国首脑会议以后，美国正全面进行加剧国际紧张局势的活动，加速推行它的侵略政策和战争政策。据西方通讯社透露，美国正准备进一步加紧武装西德。北大西洋集团扬言最近将要大大修改巴黎协定，解除对西德重新武装的最后一点限制，使西德能够更加放手地进行复活军国主义势力。大批美国将领本月内将去西柏林策划加强西德军事力量的新阴谋。加速复活另一个在远东的战争策源地，当然也是美国备战计划中的一个重要部分。最近一个时期，由于日美“安全条约”遭到日本人民和全世界人民越来越强烈的反对，美国统治集团掩饰不了它对日本国会迟迟不批准日美军事同盟条约的忧虑心情。在美国间谍飞机侵入苏联领空进行挑衅的罪行被揭露以后，华盛顿当局更是担心这将会使日本国会批准这一条约的阴谋遇到新的严重障碍。据日本共同社透露，美国政府最近追问岸信介政府：“美国国会准备在6月底以前结束审议工作，日本国会能否通过新安全条约？”这种责问反映了美国统治集团的焦急。美国一手破坏了四国首脑会议，在美日反动派看来，这是强使日本国会通过日美军事同盟条约的大好机会。日本自由民主党议员平野三郎就公开说：四国首脑会议流产给岸信介创造了使日美军事同盟条约获得批准所需要的“国际政治气氛”。合众国际社甚至不隐讳岸信介集团对于美国破坏了四国首脑会议感到“高兴”。很显然，美日反动派是要利用美国破坏四国首脑会议而造成的国际紧张局势，向日本人民发动一次“突袭”，不顾一切地强使国会“批准”日美军事同盟条约，以便使日本军国主义势力公开地加快进行核武装，把日本纳入美国的原子战略体系，使整个日本成为美国的核战争基地。
    随着岸信介集团操纵国会强行通过日美军事同盟条约而来的，必将是美日帝国主义在亚洲进行侵略扩张阴谋的进一步加紧。谁都知道，日美军事同盟条约规定日本不仅得以无限度地扩充军备、加速进行核武装；而且可以派兵出国，协同美军共同作战。而根据岸信介集团关于条约适用地区的解释，它的侵略矛头是针对中国、苏联和亚洲各国的。自从这个条约签订以来，尽管它还没有经日本国会批准，岸信介集团已经不断地加紧增强日本军国主义的军事力量。岸信介政府的“防卫厅”长官赤城宗德3月11日发表的1960年度日本扩充军备的各项数字表明，日本扩军速度已大大加快，今年度日本军事力量将大体上接近原订的1965年度指标。目前日本“防卫厅”还正在加紧拟定“第二个长期充实防卫力量计划”，以便根据日美军事同盟条约的要求加速实行核武装。美国也正利用同岸信介集团签订的这一条约重新部署和加强美国侵略军在日本的军事基地网。日美军事同盟条约实施以后，美日反动派必然在所谓“安全保障”和“共同合作”的幌子下更加公开地加紧进行扩军备战，使日本成为美国在远东进行侵略的核战争基地。事实很明显，如果美国一旦发动战争，作为美国原子基地的日本必然要首先遭到毁灭性回击。最近由于美国军用飞机利用日本的基地对苏联进行间谍活动，苏联已经向日本提出严重的警告。也不难明白，由于美日反动派互相勾结，加紧准备侵略战争，首先受害的一定是日本人民。曾经深受日本军国主义祸患和侵略战争灾难的日本人民当然不能接受美日反动派给他们安排的这种可怕的命运，当然不能听任日美军事同盟条约把他们驱向战争的深渊！
    不仅如此，日美军事同盟条约将使美军得以长期占领日本并且加强了美国对日本的军事、政治和经济各方面的控制。战后以来，日本人民已经受尽了美国占领的压迫和欺凌，国家主权受到了极大的损害。日美军事同盟条约的实施，将使日本更加处于屈辱的地位，这当然也是要求独立、和平、民主、中立的日本人民所不能容忍的。
    一年多以来的事实已经充分表明，日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的意志是十分坚强的。他们为反对这个条约而展开十六次统一行动，规模一次比一次巨大，声势一次比一次壮阔。各地递交国会的请愿书超过一千二百万份，签名反对批准日美“安全条约”的人数已达一千三百五十万以上。日本人民早已坚决地表示，不管日美军事同盟条约是否得到国会批准，他们一定坚持斗争为粉碎这个侵略性的条约而奋斗下去。岸信介集团强使议会批准新的日美“安全条约”后，已激起了日本人民的无比愤怒。一个声势浩大的粉碎日美军事同盟条约、打倒岸信介内阁、解散国会的运动正在日本全国展开。继20日东京十万人举行了集会宣布条约无效，工人学生在国会周围高呼“打倒岸信介政府”之后，日本各地两万多代表21日在东京又举行大规模示威，他们不仅提出“反对日美军事同盟！”“岸信介内阁立即总辞职！”并且到美国大使馆门前示威，要求“美国U—2型喷气机立即撤出日本！”“反对艾森豪威尔访问日本！”高呼“美国佬快滚蛋！”。日本各政党团体也纷纷发表声明，愤怒抗议岸信介集团强行通过日美军事同盟条约的暴行。日本社会党宣布：“我们否认自由民主党的一切决定。我们反对他们的独裁统治，我们要打倒岸信介内阁，我们要求立即解散国会”。21日，社会党两院议员通过决定，要求岸信介内阁总辞职和众议院议长清濑一郎辞职。日本共产党要求全体日本人民加强斗争直到推翻岸信介政府、解散国会和粉碎日美军事同盟条约为止，并且指出：“真正的斗争现在还刚开始”。工会总评议会、
  “安全条约批判会”等团体也声明不承认岸信介集团的这个所谓“批准”。民主社会党也表示认为众议院“通过”的新“安全条约”和延长国会会期的决议是无效的。就是在岸信介的自由民主党内也有不少有见识的人士不同意岸信介集团极其野蛮的做法。据每日广播公司20日报道，一直主张对新日美“安全条约”进行慎重审议的自由民主党的三木—松村派和石桥派的议员“对于岸信介采取的强行措施，表示严厉的批判”。岸信介政府的通商产业相池田勇人也认为岸信介集团的“做法太过火”，要它“澄清执行机构的责任”。岸信介集团企图以用暴力强行批准日美军事同盟条约的既成事实来扑灭日本人民的斗争火焰，结果却使得日本人民的怒火更猛烈地燃烧起来；岸信介集团把反对派的议员赶出国会来制造所谓“一致通过”，但是却阻止不了代表日本人民意志的党派团体用更有力的方式反对这个卖国条约。岸信介集团现在比过去任何时候都要孤立。不久以前，日本资产阶级报纸“朝日新闻”曾经指出，“岸首相坐在定时炸弹的上面”。现在由于岸信介集团彻底暴露了它坚决与人民为敌的凶恶面目，岸信介下面的定时炸弹爆炸的时刻是更加临近了。日本人民正在再接再厉，把反对岸信介卖国政府和美国侵略者的斗争进行到底，直到最后胜利。
    日本军国主义的复活和日本公开参加美国的侵略性军事集团，不仅关系到日本人民的命运，而且关系到亚洲和世界的和平。日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约，争取独立、和平、民主、中立的斗争，绝不是孤立的，它是曾经惨遭日本军国主义蹂躏的亚洲各国人民为反对侵略、维护远东的和平与安全的共同斗争的一部分。日本人民的斗争必将得到亚洲各国人民的支持。
    中国人民一贯支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约，争取独立、和平、民主、中立的正义斗争，并把日本人民的斗争看作是对中国人民的支持。我们在这共同斗争中，将永远互相鼓励、互相支持。毛主席在5月14日接见正在中国访问的日本朋友时说：“日本人民是很有希望的。中国人民过去、现在和将来都坚决支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。”这是六亿五千万中国人民的意志。让我们团结起来，肩并肩地为日本、中国、亚洲以及世界的和平与安全，共同斗争，反对美日帝国主义，为推翻日美军事同盟条约而斗争到底！
