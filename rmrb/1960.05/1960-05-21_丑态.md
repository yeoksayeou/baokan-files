    Ugly Spectacle

    According to newspaper reports, the heads of the three Western powers held a meeting at the Élysée Palace on the 17th, attempting to force the Soviet Union to accept their "conditions" for a four-power summit. The picture shows Eisenhower, De Gaulle, and Macmillan outside the Élysée Palace after the meeting. The United States is the culprit for undermining the summit, yet it wants to blame the Soviet Union. The three accomplices are playing new tricks, plotting conspiracies in the Élysée Palace. But it's all a futile scheme, with De Gaulle playing the fool. They originally intended to cover up their ugliness but instead exposed it, one embarrassed,
  one annoyed,
    one worried.

    丑态
    据报纸消息：西方三国首脑17日曾在爱丽舍宫举行会谈，企图迫使苏联接受其“条件”举行四国首脑会议。图中是艾森豪威尔和戴高乐、麦克米伦会谈后在爱丽舍宫旁的情形。美国是破坏首脑会议的祸首。却想反咬苏联一口。三个伙计玩弄新的花招，爱丽舍宫中布设阴谋。怎奈是白设了一个圈套，戴高乐白白出头。原来打算遮丑反倒出丑，一个难堪，
  一个懊恼，
    一个发愁。
