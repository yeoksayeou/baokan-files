Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 19th: According to a report by the Press Trust of India, some people in Imphal, the capital of Manipur State, held a gathering in a polo ground on May 16th, disregarding the authorities' ban on gatherings of more than five people, to demand the establishment of a responsible government.

    The meeting called on everyone to hold a "Resistance Day" and demanded that propaganda and mobilization work be carried out for the establishment of a responsible government in Manipur State. Manipur State is one of the six centrally administered territories of the Indian central government and is currently under the administration of a Chief Commissioner representing the central government.

    Police fired several tear gas canisters at the assembled masses and used batons to disperse the gathering.

    The masses later regrouped on the polo ground and marched in formation.

    A portion of the masses advanced towards the Police Headquarters, and the police dispersed the marching crowd with batons.

    In the evening, demonstrations occurred again. About a thousand people gathered in front of the Chief Commissioner's residence and were dispersed by the police.

    The news said that thirty people, including the Naga member of parliament Keishing, who led the masses in the gathering at the polo ground, were arrested. Forty-five people, including nine women, were injured and hospitalized on the 16th when police suppressed the demonstrators.

    The news said that before this, the police had repeatedly opened fire and beaten demonstrating masses, and hundreds of people, including many women and students, had been seriously injured.

    According to the "Times of India", the main markets and vegetable markets in Imphal remained closed on May 17th, the second day of the "Resistance Day" held by the masses in defiance of the ban. In the suburbs, an incident occurred where fifty women blocked public buses from passing.

    新华社新德里19日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，曼尼普尔邦首府英帕尔一些群众为要求建立负责政府，5月16日不顾当局禁止五人以上集会的法令，又在一个马球场上举行了集会。
    大会号召大家举行“抵抗日”，并且要求为在曼尼普尔邦建立负责政府而进行宣传鼓动工作。曼尼普尔邦是印度中央政府六个直辖区之一，目前由代表中央政府的首席专员行使政权。
    警察向集会的群众发射了几枚催泪弹，并且使用警棍来驱散集会的群众。
    群众后来又在马球场上重新聚集起来，并列队游行。
    一部分群众向警察总局前进，警察用警棍驱散游行队伍。
    晚间，又发生了示威游行。约有一千人聚集在首席专员住宅门口，被警察驱散。
    消息说，领导群众在马球场集会的那加族议员凯欣等共三十人被逮捕。有四十五人包括九名妇女在内16日在警察镇压示威者时受伤被送进医院。
    消息说，在此以前，警察曾不止一次向示威群众开枪射击和殴打，已有包括许多妇女和学生在内的数百人受到重伤。
    据“印度时报”报道，英帕尔的主要市集和菜市场在5月17日仍然关闭着，这是群众不顾禁令举行“抵抗日”的第二天。在郊区，发生了五十名妇女阻止公共汽车通行的事件。
