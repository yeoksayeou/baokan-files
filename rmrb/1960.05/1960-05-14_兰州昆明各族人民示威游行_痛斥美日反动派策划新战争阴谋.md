Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, May 13th: Over 200,000 people of all nationalities and from all walks of life in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, held a large-scale rally and demonstration on the afternoon of the 12th, resolutely supporting the Japanese people's just struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty.

The demonstration队伍 carried large cartoons and banners, chanting slogans, and converging on the central square in a mighty procession. Among the demonstrators was an old worker named Wang Deshan, who clenched his fists tightly and shouted, "The Chinese and Japanese people unite to oppose the revival of Japanese militarism! Down with US imperialism!" This old worker spent long years under the whip of the Japanese寇 fifteen years ago and suffered greatly from the disasters brought by the war of aggression. He warned: "If US imperialism and Japanese militarism dare to launch a war, we will certainly mobilize the whole people to wipe out imperialism completely!" Chen Baofu, a former volunteer soldier who had fought fiercely against American bandits on the Korean battlefield, stood at the forefront of the militia队伍, constantly shouting slogans along with other militiamen. He said: "US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of peace-loving people all over the world. During the Korean War, I personally witnessed the heinous crimes of the American bandits slaughtering the Korean people. Today, it妄想 to revive Japanese militarism. We believe that the Japanese people will surely be able to drive US imperialism out of Japan!"

After the meeting began, Ruan Dimin, member of the Standing Committee of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Minister of Propaganda, spoke first. He said that the US-Japan military alliance treaty is a criminal treaty in which the Japanese reactionaries and US imperialism collude with each other to prepare for a new war of aggression and threaten peace in Asia and the world. The original instigator of this treaty is US imperialism. He said that the aggressive nature of US imperialism will not change. However, the aggressive plans and war plans of US imperialism will never succeed. He pointed out that the era in which the Chinese people were bullied is gone forever. If US imperialism and Japanese militarists dare to attack us, they will surely be bruised and battered. Deng Baoshan, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and Governor of Gansu Province, spoke at the meeting. He represented all members of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in expressing their firm opposition to the US-Japan military alliance treaty and their firm support for the just struggle of the Japanese people.

Also speaking at the meeting were the heads of various people's organizations and local organizations of democratic parties, as well as representatives of workers, students, and farmers. The meeting finally adopted a telegram.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, May 13th: 70,000 people in Kunming held a rally and demonstration on the 12th to resolutely support the just struggle of the Japanese people against the US-Japan military alliance treaty.

Starting at noon, people flocked to the streets in groups to demonstrate. In the ranks of the demonstration, there were workers, peasants, members of urban people's communes, militiamen, and students from Kunming, as well as Dai workers from the Nujiang and Lancangjiang rivers, Jingpo farmers from Gaoligong Mountain, and Tibetan herdsmen from the Diqing Plateau. On September 30, 1940, Japanese寇 planes bombed Kunming, and many people lost their loved ones and became homeless. Xin Huixian, a resident, lost six of her seven family members in that bombing, and both of her legs were amputated due to injuries. Speaking of this bloody feud, she said angrily: "US imperialism signed a military alliance treaty with Nobusuke Kishi, which is to allow Japanese militarism to come again to take away the parents and brothers of more people and blow up more people's hands and feet. I resolutely oppose it." Pu Da and He Lapiao, Jingpo farmers from Gaoligong Mountain, denounced the brutal trampling of the Jingpo and Benglong people by Japanese militarism fifteen years ago. He shouted with everyone: "Oppose the US-Japan military alliance treaty!" "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!"

At 3 p.m., the demonstrators gathered at the Dongfeng Stadium for a rally. Liu Minghui, Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Governor of Yunnan Province, Lieutenant General Chen Kang, head of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Kunming, and heads of various departments of Yunnan Province and Kunming City attended the meeting. Wu Wenxiang, the Vietnamese Consul in Kunming, and the local trade delegation of the Dai-Miao Autonomous Region of Lao Cai and Ha Giang, Vietnam, also attended the meeting.

Liu Zhiyan, member of the Standing Committee of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting on behalf of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. First of all, he represented the people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan Province in expressing their heartfelt respect to the heroic and unyielding Japanese people, and expressing their firm support for the just struggle of the Japanese people. He said: The signing of the military alliance treaty by US imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke government is an important symbol of the revival of Japanese militarism and a continuation of the war policy of US imperialism. This fact proves that the nature of imperialism will not change. Under the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the US imperialists are forced to put on some pretense of peace and play with some words of peace, but under the guise of "peace," they are vigorously engaged in military expansion and war preparations. Liu Zhiyan said that the people cannot be deceived. The volcanoes under the feet of US imperialism are erupting one by one. The people of South Korea have overthrown Syngman Rhee, and the people of Turkey have also launched a heroic struggle against the Menderes dictatorial regime. Facts have proved that the more frantically US imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries carry out military expansion and war preparations, the closer they get to death.

Following this, representatives of the Yunnan Provincial and Kunming Municipal Political Consultative Conferences, various people's organizations, and local organizations of various democratic parties at the provincial and municipal levels, as well as representatives of workers, peasants, members of urban people's communes, and students, spoke at the meeting. The meeting finally read out a telegram.

    兰州昆明各族人民示威游行
    痛斥美日反动派策划新战争阴谋
    新华社兰州13日电　甘肃省兰州市各族各界二十多万人12日下午举行大规模的集会和示威游行，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。
    示威队伍抬着大幅漫画和标语牌，高呼着口号，浩浩荡荡地向中央广场汇集。在示威队伍中，有一位名叫王德山的老工人，他把拳头握得紧紧的，振臂高呼：“中日人民团结起来，反对复活日本军国主义，打倒美帝国主义！”这位老工人十五年前曾在日寇的皮鞭下度过了漫长的岁月，受尽了侵略战争带来的灾难。他警告说：“如果美帝国主义和日本军国主义胆敢发动战争，我们就一定全民动员起来，把帝国主义彻底消灭干净！”曾经在朝鲜战场上痛击过美国强盗的原志愿军战士陈保福，站在民兵队伍的最前面，和其他民兵一起不断地高呼口号。他说：“美帝国主义是全世界爱好和平人民最凶恶的敌人。在朝鲜战争期间，我亲眼看到过美国强盗屠杀朝鲜人民的滔天罪行，今天它又妄想复活日本军国主义，我们相信日本人民一定能够把美帝国主义从日本赶出去！”
    大会开始后，中共甘肃省委常委、宣传部长阮迪民首先讲话。他说，日美军事同盟条约，是日本反动派和美帝国主义互相勾结准备新的侵略战争、威胁亚洲和世界和平的罪恶条约，这个条约的原谋者是美帝国主义。他说，美帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的。但是，美帝国主义的侵略计划和战争计划永远不能得逞。他指出，中国人民任人欺侮的时代已经一去不复返了。如果美帝国主义和日本军国主义者敢于向我们进攻，它就一定会碰得头破血流。民革甘肃省委主任委员、甘肃省省长邓宝珊在会上讲了话，他代表民革甘肃省全体成员表示，坚决反对日美军事同盟条约，坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争。
    在大会上讲话的，还有各人民团体和民主党派地方组织的负责人，以及工人、学生、农民的代表等。大会最后通过了通电。
    据新华社昆明13日电　昆明市12日有七万人举行集会和示威游行，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。
    从中午开始，人们成群结队地涌向街头游行示威。在游行的行列里，有昆明市的工人、农民、城市人民公社的社员、民兵和学生，还有来自怒江、澜沧江边的傣族工人，高黎贡山的景颇族农民、迪庆高原上的藏族牧民。1940年9月30日，日寇飞机轰炸昆明，有许多人失去亲人，无家可归。居民辛惠仙一家七口人，有六口人在那次轰炸中被炸死，她自己的两条腿也因受伤被全部锯掉。提起这血海深仇，她愤怒地说：“美帝国主义同岸信介签订军事同盟条约，就是要日本军国主义再来夺去更多人的父母兄弟，炸掉更多人的手脚，我坚决反对。”来自高黎贡山上的景颇族农民普大、崩龙人贺拉飘，控诉了十五年前日本军国主义残酷蹂躏景颇、崩龙人的情况，他同大家一起高呼：“反对日美军事同盟条约！”“反对复活日本军国主义！”
    下午三时，示威游行的人们聚集在东风体育场举行大会。中共云南省委书记处书记、云南省副省长刘明辉，人民解放军驻昆明部队首长陈康中将，云南省和昆明市各部门的负责人都出席了大会。越南驻昆明领事武文享，越南老街、河江傣苗自治区地方贸易代表团也参加了大会。
    中共云南省委常委、中共昆明市委书记处书记刘植岩代表中共云南省委和中共昆明市委在会上讲了话。他首先代表云南省各族人民对英勇不屈的日本人民表示衷心的敬意，对日本人民的正义斗争，表示坚决的支持。他说：美帝国主义和岸信介政府签订军事同盟条约，这是日本军国主义复活的一个重要标志，是美帝国主义战争政策的继续。这个事实证明了：帝国主义的本性是不会改变的。在东风压倒西风的形势下，美帝国主义者虽然被迫装出一些和平姿态，玩弄一些和平的字眼，但在“和平”的幌子下却大搞其扩军备战。刘植岩说，人民是欺骗不了的，美帝国主义脚下的火山一座一座的在爆发了，南朝鲜人民已经打倒了李承晚，土耳其人民也掀起了反对曼德列斯独裁政权的英勇斗争。事实证明，美帝国主义和日本反动派越是疯狂地进行扩军备战，就越接近死亡。
    接着在大会上讲话的，有云南省和昆明市政协、各人民团体和各民主党派省市地方组织的代表，以及工人、农民、城市人民公社社员、学生的代表等。大会最后宣读了通电。
