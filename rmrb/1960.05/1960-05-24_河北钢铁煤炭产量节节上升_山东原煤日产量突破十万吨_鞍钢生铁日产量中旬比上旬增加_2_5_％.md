Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd:  Workers in Hebei Province's steel, iron, and coal industries have launched a new production upsurge, determined to complete more than half of the annual plan in the first half of the year. From May 1st to 20th, the province's daily output of raw coal exceeded the state plan every day, with the daily output level increasing by 9.11% compared to the same period in April. The average daily output of steel ingots in the first ten days of May increased by 4.1% compared to the last ten days of April, and increased by another 13% in the middle ten days of May compared to the first ten days. Since mid-May, pig iron production has also been rising steadily, with the average daily output increasing by 15% compared to the first ten days.

In order to ensure the increased production of raw materials and fuel, party committees and industrial leadership departments at all levels in Hebei Province established working groups in May to conduct in-depth inspections of factories and mines. Many factories and mines held employee meetings and cadre meetings to conscientiously review and revise the leap forward plans and guarantee measures. In Handan City, the main iron-producing area of ​​Hebei Province, the municipal party secretary led more than 80 cadres from the metallurgical system to form 21 working groups, which went deep into the iron smelting plants to lead employees to overcome many key production problems in a timely manner, so that the city's pig iron production increased rapidly. The average daily output of pig iron in the first five days of mid-May increased by 18.8% compared to the first ten days, and increased by another 10.31% from May 16th to 20th compared to the first five days of mid-May. More than 4,000 cadres and technicians from six coal mines, including Kailuan, Fengfeng, and Jingxing, led by party secretaries and mine directors, went deep into the front line of production, greatly boosting the morale of the workers and promoting production. In the first and middle ten days of May, the province overproduced more than 167,000 tons of raw coal.

Since the second quarter, nearly a hundred small coal mines and small iron mines have been newly built in the province, and 71 blast furnaces with volumes ranging from 6.5 to 100 cubic meters have been newly built and repaired. These blast furnaces have been adequately supplied with raw materials such as ore and coal, and most of them have been put into production.

The mining, coking, and transportation industries are also carrying out large-scale collaboration to fully protect iron and steel.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd: Shandong Province's coal industry successively broke the 100,000-ton mark for daily raw coal output on the 18th and 19th, creating the highest record for daily output.

In order to quickly realize the Shandong Provincial Party Committee's requirement of producing 100,000 tons of coal per day, each mining bureau and coal mine established a high-yield battle headquarters, headed by the bureau and mine party secretaries. The mines held mobilization rallies or broadcast rallies for all employees, greatly encouraging enthusiasm, and implemented the high-yield plan to each mine, team, and worker. The Party Secretary of Zibo Mining Bureau went deep into the work surface to lead the employees to vigorously carry out multi-cycle operations. As of the 18th, 18 work surfaces had achieved normal double-cycle and multi-cycle operations, and the cutting discs of 47 coal cutters had been generally lengthened, greatly increasing the output of raw coal. Leading cadres of the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau went deep into the site to grasp key production issues, combined with the masses, and solved key problems such as the frequent failures of the Taozhuang coal mine's chutes and the failure of material supply, which quickly improved the production level.

In the battle to seize coal, the small coal mines in various places also played a very big role. The total output of each small coal mine in the first four and a half months of this year exceeded the original planned target for the first half of the year.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 22nd: The "Strive for Red May, Seize Iron to Protect Steel" campaign of the Anshan Iron and Steel's ironmaking system is in full swing, and pig iron production is rising steadily. In mid-May, the average daily output of pig iron at Anshan Iron and Steel increased by 2.5% compared to the first ten days, and the utilization coefficient of large blast furnaces averaged 1.84.

In the "Seize Iron to Protect Steel" campaign, the employees of the ten blast furnaces in the iron smelting plant found targets, challenged each other to compete, and promoted the soaring utilization coefficient of the blast furnaces. The "Blast Furnace King" running in front—the utilization coefficient of the No. 10 blast furnace—has stably crossed the 2 mark, averaging 2.059 in the first and middle ten days of May, increasing the country's pig iron production by more than 2,300 tons. Their competitor, the No. 4 blast furnace, is not to be outdone. Its utilization coefficient has increased from 1.774 in April to 1.948 in mid-May, and its daily output level has increased by more than 9.8%.

In order to ensure that the blast furnaces are "well-fed," the workers in raw material production launched a vigorous competition of "four highs" (high operating rate, high grade, high coefficient, and high mining rate) and "two lows" (low tailings and low moisture) as early as April. In mid-May, the output of iron ore and concentrate powder increased by 11.4% and 7.5% respectively compared with the first ten days.

    河北钢铁煤炭产量节节上升
    山东原煤日产量突破十万吨
    鞍钢生铁日产量中旬比上旬增加2.5％
    据新华社天津23日电　河北省钢、铁、煤炭工业职工掀起了新的生产高潮，决心在上半年内完成全年计划一半以上。5月1日至20日，全省原煤日产量天天超额完成国家计划，日产水平比4月同期提高9.11％；钢锭平均日产量5月上旬比4月下旬上升4.1％，中旬又比上旬增加了13％；中旬以来，生铁产量也在节节上升，平均日产量比上旬提高15％。
    为了确保原料材料燃料增产，河北省各级党委和工业领导部门5月份纷纷成立工作组，深入厂矿检查工作。许多厂矿召开职工大会和干部大会，认真检查和修订跃进计划和保证措施。在河北省主要产铁区邯郸市，市委书记率领八十多名冶金系统干部，组成二十一个工作组，深入各炼铁厂，领导职工及时攻破了许多生产关键，使全市生铁产量迅速增长，中旬头五天生铁平均日产量比上旬增长了18.8％，16至20日又比中旬头五天增长了10.31％。开滦、峰峰、井陉等六个煤矿四千多名干部和技术人员，在党委书记和矿长率领下，深入生产第一线，大大鼓舞了职工的干劲，推动了生产。全省在5月上中旬，就超产原煤十六万七千多吨。
    第二季度以来，全省新建了近百座小煤矿、小铁矿，新建和修复的六点五至一百立方米高炉有七十一座，这些高炉得到矿石、煤炭等原料的充足供应，大部分已经投入生产。
    矿山、炼焦、运输等行业也大搞协作，全力保铁保钢。
    据新华社济南23日电　山东省煤炭工业18日和19日两天连续突破日产原煤十万吨大关，创造了日产量最高纪录。
    各矿务局和煤矿为了迅速实现中共山东省委提出的日产十万吨煤的要求，都成立高产战役指挥部，由局、矿党委书记挂帅。各矿纷纷召开全体职工誓师跃进大会或广播大会，大鼓干劲，并且把高产计划落实到每个矿井、队组和工人。淄博矿务局党委书记深入工作面领导职工大力开展多循环作业，截至18日，已有十八个工作面实现了正常的双循环和多循环作业，有四十七台截煤机的截盘普遍加长，大大提高了原煤产量。枣庄矿务局的领导干部深入现场，分头抓生产关键，与群众结合，解决了陶庄煤矿溜子故障较多、器材供应跟不上等关键问题，使生产水平很快提高。
    在夺煤大战中，各地的小煤井也发挥了很大的作用。各小煤井今年四个半月的总产量就超过了原定上半年的计划指标。
    据新华社鞍山22日电　鞍钢炼铁系统的奋战红5月、“夺铁保钢”大会战，正进行得如火如荼，生铁产量节节上升。5月中旬，鞍钢的生铁日产量，平均比上旬增加2.5％，大高炉的利用系数平均达到一点八四。
    在“夺铁保钢”大会战中，炼铁厂十座高炉的职工，纷纷自找对象，挑战比武，推动高炉利用系数扶摇直上。跑在前面的“高炉王”——十号高炉的利用系数，已经稳定地跨过二的大关，5月上、中两旬平均达到二点零五九，给国家增产了两千三百多吨生铁。他们的竞赛对手四号高炉也不示弱，利用系数已从4月份的一点七七四提高到5月中旬的一点九四八，日产水平增加了9.8％以上。
    为了保证高炉“吃得饱吃得好”，原料生产的工人们早在4月份就轰轰烈烈地展开了“四高”（高作业率、高品位、高系数、高采矿率）、“两低”（低尾矿、低水分）的竞赛。5月中旬，铁矿石和精矿粉的产量，分别比上旬提高了11.4％和7.5％。
