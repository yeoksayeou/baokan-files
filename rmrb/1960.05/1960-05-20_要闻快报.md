	Ministry of Metallurgy Sets Deadline for Promoting Major Advanced Experiences
	In order to rapidly apply major technological innovation achievements to production, the Ministry of Metallurgy has decided to promote a series of major advanced experiences. These experiences include increasing smelting intensity, reducing coke ratio, reducing iron consumption, saving electricity and materials, as well as high platforms and low cargo positions for transportation and loading/unloading. In addition, there are advanced experiences in fully utilizing waste gas, waste residue, and waste liquid. It is required to make significant achievements in the widespread promotion of these experiences before July 1.

	Wuhan Establishes Sixty-Six Small Power Stations
	Wuhan City, with the spirit of self-reliance and using indigenous methods, has vigorously engaged in mass-run electricity generation. In one month, the installed capacity of mass-run power generation has exceeded the city's total installed capacity before liberation. Currently, the city has built sixty-six small power stations combining indigenous and modern methods. During the process of setting up power stations, many units have used discarded iron drums to make gas generators, split old water pipes to use as turbine blades, replaced iron pipes with bamboo pipes, and used waste willow branches to generate gas. They then utilize waste gas or discarded energy to generate electricity, with some small power stations achieving essentially cost-free electricity generation.

	Guangzhou Mass Produces Coal Mining Equipment
	In order to vigorously support the coal mining battle in the southern coalfields, a group of machinery factories in Guangzhou is rushing to produce coal mining equipment. Currently, more than thirty factories, including Yangcheng Machine Factory, have produced hundreds of sets (pieces) of equipment and tools such as water pumps, air compressors, drill bits, and pneumatic picks. This batch of equipment has been successively transported to the mines, and some have already been put into the coal mining battle.

	"Circular Steam Network" Used in Seventeen Ways by First Automotive Works
	A "circular steam network" centered on the Qingquan Bathhouse has appeared in Gongxiang, Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province. Steam is generated from the bathhouse and sent to eight neighboring food and service establishments, including noodle restaurants, pastry shops, dry cleaners, barbershops, and water stoves. These departments use the steam for cooking, stir-frying, washing clothes, drying, ironing clothes, and perming hair. Steam in this area is already being used for seventeen different purposes.

	Laiyang County Has Ten Thousand Wind-Powered Waterwheels
	Under the leadership of the Laiyang County Party Committee in Shandong, the county has manufactured more than seven thousand wind-powered waterwheels in less than a month. Together with the existing two thousand, there are now more than ten thousand, basically achieving wind-powered waterwheels throughout the county.

	The Laiyang waterwheels can rotate with a three- to four-grade wind, and their efficiency is two to three times higher than that of the Liberation-style waterwheels. This not only reduces physical labor but also frees up a large number of laborers.

	Now Eliminate One Moth, Reap One More Jin of Grain in Autumn
	Under the slogan "Now eliminate one moth, reap one more jin of grain in autumn," Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, is seizing the favorable opportunity of the rice stem borer's initial outbreak to launch a surprise attack to eliminate the pest. The county's 22,000 mu of greening mid-season rice seedlings and 90,000 mu of early rice fields have been sprayed with pesticides twice. According to inspections, the pest control effect is generally above 90%. Currently, all communes in the county are continuing to control the pests, and the masses are calling for "leaving no moth behind, leaving no nest unaddressed."

	Mao City Commune Successfully Trial-Plants Aquatic Green Manure
	Mao City Commune in Jianli County, Hubei Province, has successfully trial-planted aquatic green manure in large areas of deep-water lake fields. The Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture held an on-site meeting here and decided to promote it.

	Last year, Mao City Commune cultivated aquatic green manure such as Jiangye grass, Sicao grass, and Shuihaozi in more than 70,000 mu of lake fields, achieving a bumper harvest of an average rice yield of more than 690 jin per mu, an increase of more than 200 jin per mu compared to fields without green manure.

	Six Mares Produce Eighteen Foals in Three Years
	The Haoji Production Brigade of the Xingren Commune in Haiyuan County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, has six mares that have produced eighteen foals in three years, all of whom are healthy and strong.

	These six mares have been raised collectively since the spring of 1957. In the same year, all were successfully bred and became pregnant. In the spring of the following year, all six mares gave birth to foals successively, and all survived. Seven days after giving birth, the mares were bred again. By the spring of last year, these six mares had all given birth to foals for the second time. This spring, these six mares have given birth to foals for the third time.
