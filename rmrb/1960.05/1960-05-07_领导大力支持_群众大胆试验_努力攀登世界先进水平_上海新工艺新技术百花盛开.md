Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th. Shanghai's broad masses of workers, while further engaging in mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, are comprehensively undertaking technological innovation and revolution, developing and creating many new crafts and technologies.  A large number of new and inspiring scenes are now emerging on the industrial front: founding without sand, piercing without drilling, processing without lathes, painting without spray guns, welding without masks, sewing leather shoes without needles and thread... This series of new technologies and techniques, some are completely different from the original technology, and some are completely opposite. Dye factories used to be full of water, and workers produced in rubber shoes all year round, with their faces and bodies covered in dye. Workers said: producing black dye, everyone is Bao Gong; producing red dye, everyone becomes Guan Gong. Workers at the China No. 2 Dye Factory recently successfully researched a new technology, and the workshop is so clean that it can be carpeted. Workers are now operating in white work clothes. There are currently more than 700 such new technologies and techniques being promoted in Shanghai.

Many new crafts and technologies are being fully promoted. Because they concentrate more people's wisdom and more extensive practice, they are more complete, more efficient, and have a wider range of uses than in the past. The first domestic automatic combined electroplating machine successfully developed by the bicycle industry at the end of last year is a new equipment specially used for electroplating chrome and copper-tin alloys; in the past one or two months, electrical appliances, scientific instruments, medical equipment, cultural and educational supplies and other industries, according to the principle of bicycle electroplating machine, combined with the requirements of various different products, and successfully developed several electroplating machines with different structures, used for plating nickel, zinc, tin and other alloys.

The Adoption of New Technologies and Techniques
Greatly Promotes Current Production

The adoption of new technologies and techniques has greatly promoted current production, broken through many weak links, and increased production efficiency several times, dozens of times, or even hundreds of times. At the same time, it has also been very effective in improving product quality, saving labor, reducing raw material consumption, reducing labor intensity, and strengthening safe production. In the past, Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory used spray guns for painting, which was inefficient, uneven, consumed a lot of paint, and also affected the health of workers; now it uses electrostatic painting, the workpiece enters a high-voltage electrostatic field, and the atomized paint is automatically and evenly sprayed around the workpiece.  The working hours are only one-half to one-sixth of the original, and the paint utilization rate has increased from the original 50% to more than 90%. The Shanghai Bicycle Factory has equipped a complete set of new bicycle production technology in the main links such as founding, machining, heat treatment, welding, polishing, painting, electroplating, and drying. It has now become the largest, best quality, most variety, and lowest cost factory in the same industry.

The adoption and promotion of new technologies has brought about tremendous changes in the technical appearance of many industries and greatly accelerated the speed of technical transformation. Compared with old crafts and old technologies, these new crafts and new technologies are not more complicated, but simpler, more convenient, and more faster, better and more economical. Their emergence is not only enriching and developing the scientific and technological theory in this regard, but also providing new basis for improving future factory design, process design, and product design.

The Emergence of New Technologies and Techniques
Is the Inevitable Result of Technological Revolution

The emergence and application of a large number of new crafts and technologies is the inevitable result of the great development of the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, and also reflects the ambition of the broad masses of workers in Shanghai to catch up with the world's advanced technological level. In the Great Leap Forward in the past two years, the working class in Shanghai has broken superstitions, emancipated their minds, and achieved great results and experience in creating and applying new technologies and techniques. Therefore, in this year's technological innovation and technological revolution movement, reforming old crafts and adopting new crafts has become the urgent desire of the broad masses. The workers said: What foreign countries have, we must also have; what foreign countries do not have, we will create; what is not in the books, we will write ourselves. Some people in the heat treatment workshop of the Shanghai Tool Factory used to think that heat treatment technology is not as good as other technologies, and it is not easy to change it casually. Workers can only operate according to the temperature and time specified in the technology, otherwise the quality of the workpiece is not guaranteed; however, workers have discovered many "gaps" in the old technology that can be broken through in actual operation. Since the beginning of this year, the workers in the entire heat treatment workshop have used the experience accumulated in their operations to comprehensively innovate the original technology, and the production capacity has increased threefold.

Leaders Resolutely Pioneering and Opening the Way
Close Cooperation Between Various Departments

Technological revolution is different from general innovation, especially some fundamental and directional revolutions, which not only require close cooperation from other departments in the research process, but also cause a series of impacts on the entire production process after the research is successful. Therefore, strong leadership support to create conditions for new technologies and pioneer the way is often a key to whether new technologies can be quickly successful and widely promoted. When the Shanghai Instrument Factory promoted the new technology of non-cutting processing, one of the biggest difficulties was the insufficient supply of molds. The factory leaders immediately mobilized the workers in the tool workshop to carry out technological revolution and adjust labor organization; on the other hand, they transferred a group of people from other workshops to support the tool workshop and help them solve the new imbalances that appeared after the adoption of the new technology, and the production efficiency of molds was greatly improved.

At present, the work of process reform is still developing. The relevant departments have formulated a full-year promotion plan for this year. The mature new technologies and techniques are being rapidly and comprehensively promoted; those that are not mature enough are also organizing relevant factories and scientific research departments to research and improve while promoting their use.

    领导大力支持　群众大胆试验　努力攀登世界先进水平
    上海新工艺新技术百花盛开
    一面大搞“四化”
    一面大闹工艺革命
    据新华社上海6日电　上海广大职工在进一步大搞机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化的同时，全面地大搞工艺革新和工艺革命，发展和创造了许多新工艺、新技术。工业战线上现在出现了大量新的动人景象：翻砂不用砂、穿孔不要钻、加工不用车床、喷漆不要喷枪、电焊不戴面罩、缝皮鞋不用针线……。这一连串的新工艺新技术，有的跟原来的工艺截然不同，有的竟完全相反。染料厂过去到处是水，工人长年穿着胶鞋生产，脸上身上全是染料。工人们说：生产黑染料，人人是包公；生产红染料，人人变关公。中国染料二厂工人最近研究成功一种新工艺，车间里干净得可以铺上地毯。工人已穿上白色工作服操作。像上述种种新工艺和新技术，上海目前正在推广的有七百多项。
    许多新工艺新技术在全面推广中，因为集中了更多人的智慧和更广泛的实践，比过去更完善，效率更高，使用范围更广了。自行车行业去年年底研究成功的国内第一台自动联合电镀机，是专门用来电镀铬和铜锡合金的新设备；最近一二个月内，电器、科学仪器、医疗器械、文教用品等行业，都根据自行车电镀机的原理，结合了各种不同产品的要求，又研究成功了几种结构不同的电镀机，用来镀镍、锌、锡和其他合金。
    新工艺新技术的采用
    大大促进了当前生产
    新工艺新技术的采用，极大地促进了当前的生产，突破了许多薄弱环节，生产效率几倍、几十倍甚至几百倍的提高，同时在提高产品质量、节约劳动力、降低原料消耗、减轻劳动强度、加强安全生产等方面，效果也非常显著。上海华通开关厂过去采用喷枪喷漆，效率低，喷不匀，油漆损耗大，还影响工人健康；现在改用静电喷漆，工作物进入高压静电场，化成雾状的油漆，自动均匀地喷在工作物的四周，花费工时只及原来的二分之一到六分之一，油漆利用率从原来的50％提高到90％以上。上海自行车厂在翻砂、机械加工、热处理、焊接、抛光、喷漆、电镀、烘干等主要环节上，配成了一整套生产自行车的新工艺，现已成为同行业中产量最大、质量最好、品种最多、成本最低的一个工厂。
    新技术的采用和推广，使许多行业的技术面貌发生了巨大的变化，大大加快了技术改造的速度。这些新工艺新技术，同旧工艺旧技术相比，不是更复杂，而是更简单，更方便，更多快好省。它们的出现，不仅正在丰富和发展着这方面的科学技术理论，而且为改进今后的厂房设计、工艺设计、产品设计提供了新的依据。
    新工艺新技术的出现
    是技术革命必然结果
    大量的新工艺新技术的涌现和采用，这是技术革新和技术革命群众运动大发展的必然结果，同时也反映了上海广大职工迎头赶上世界先进技术水平的雄心壮志。最近两年来的大跃进中，上海工人阶级破除迷信、解放思想，在创造运用新技术新工艺方面已经取得了很大成绩和经验。因此，今年的技术革新和技术革命运动中，改革旧工艺采用新工艺便成为广大群众迫切的愿望。工人们说：外国有的，我们也要有；外国没有的，我们来创造；书上没有的，我们自己来写。上海工具厂热处理车间过去有些人一直认为：热处理工艺不比其他工艺，不好随便改动，工人只能按照工艺规定的温度和时间进行操作，否则工件质量没有保证；但是，工人们在实际操作中发现了不少旧工艺的“缺口”可以突破。今年以来，整个热处理车间工人运用他们操作中积累起来的经验，全面革新了原来的工艺，生产能力猛增了三倍。
    领导坚决拓路开道
    各个部门密切配合
    工艺革命不同于一般的革新，特别是一些带有根本性和方向性的革命，不仅在研究过程中需要别的部门密切配合，在研究成功以后，也会在整个生产过程中引起一系列的影响。因此，领导上的大力支持，为新工艺创造条件，拓路开道，往往是新工艺能不能迅速成功和普遍推广的一个关键。上海仪表厂在推广无切削加工新工艺时，一个最大的困难是模具供应不足。工厂领导上立即发动工具车间工人开展技术革命，调整劳动组织；另一方面从其他车间抽调了一批人力支援工具车间，帮助他们解决采用新工艺以后所出现的新的不平衡，模具的生产效率便大大提高。
    目前，工艺改革的工作还在不断发展中。有关部门已经制订了今年全年的推广规划。已经成熟的新工艺、新技术，正在迅速全面推广；还不够成熟的，也在组织有关工厂、科学研究部门一边研究改进，一边推广使用。
