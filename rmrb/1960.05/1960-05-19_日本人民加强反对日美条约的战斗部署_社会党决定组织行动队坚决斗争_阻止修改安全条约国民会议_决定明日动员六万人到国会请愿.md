Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th -- News: As the struggle against the Japanese Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty" enters an extremely tense stage, the Japanese people are strengthening their combat deployments, determined to crush the Kishi Nobusuke group's conspiracy to forcibly pass this aggressive military alliance treaty in the Diet.

The Japanese "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" held a meeting on the 17th, deciding to mobilize 60,000 people to petition the Diet on the 20th. This joint struggle organization, composed of 140 organizations, also decided that if the Kishi Nobusuke group forcibly stops the Diet's discussion of the new "Security Treaty," it will mobilize the masses to immediately surround the Diet and wage struggle.

The Japanese Socialist Party held a plenary meeting of its members of the Diet on the 17th, deciding to form an "Action Team" led by House of Representatives member Shotaro Kasami, in order to prevent the Kishi Nobusuke group from forcibly passing the new "Security Treaty" in the Diet.

The Socialist Party also decided that, starting today, all members of the Diet would be mobilized to the House of Representatives' Special Committee on the "Security Treaty," and would cease participating in the deliberations of other committees. All Socialist Party members are prepared to mobilize at any time starting today.

On the other hand, Kishi Nobusuke convened a meeting of all Liberal Democratic Party members on the 17th, forcing all factions to accept in principle the policy of forcibly passing the new "Security Treaty" in the Diet before May 26th. The Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, Masajiro Kawashima, also gave a speech to foreign journalists on the 17th, again clamoring to use police violence to forcibly pass the treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th -- News: The Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Inejiro Asanuma, said at a gathering of 700 people in Tokyo on the evening of the 17th that the Japanese people will do everything in their power to prevent the Diet from forcibly ratifying the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Inejiro Asanuma pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke group is a group of politicians who are fighting for power and profit, and they are only satisfied with continuing to be in power, even if it means making the entire country suffer.

He emphasized, "The United States has 260 army bases and 90 naval bases in Japan. This proves that Japan has not yet achieved an independent status."

He concluded, "A diplomatic policy that conforms to the Japanese Constitution is one that promotes peaceful relations with all countries, obtains and maintains independence, adheres to non-alignment, and does not provide any military bases to foreign countries."

Saburo Eda, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, emphasized, "When the majority in the Diet cannot reflect the opinions of the actual majority of the people, as is the case with the current ruling party, the Diet should be dissolved immediately."

Socialist Party members Haruo Okada and Toshiko Tobaya emphasized that the newly signed U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is a great danger to Japan's security and Asian peace.

Referring to the issue of U.S. U-2 spy planes stationed in Japan, Socialist Party member Masaji Ishibashi said, "When the Kishi Nobusuke government has not yet said 'no' to the U.S. government on the issue of U.S. U-2 planes stationed in Japan, how can we expect this government to say 'no' to the United States in the so-called 'prior consultation' on the issue of U.S. troop deployments and changes in equipment?" Another Socialist Party member, Ichio Asukata, said that the U.S. U-2 planes stationed in Japan not only endanger Japan's security, but should also be regarded as an insult to the Japanese nation.

    日本人民加强反对日美条约的战斗部署
    社会党决定组织行动队坚决斗争
    “阻止修改安全条约国民会议”决定明日动员六万人到国会请愿
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：随着反对日本国会批准新“安全条约”的斗争进入极其紧张的阶段，日本人民正在加强战斗部署，坚决要粉碎岸信介集团企图强使国会批准这个侵略性军事同盟条约的阴谋。
    日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”17日举行会议，决定在20日动员六万人到国会请愿。这个由一百四十个组织组成的联合斗争组织还决定，如果岸信介集团强行停止国会对新“安全条约”的讨论，它将动员群众立即包围国会，进行斗争。
    日本社会党17日举行全体议员会议，决定组成以众议员岛上善太郎为队长的“行动队”，以便阻止岸信介集团在国会强行通过新“安全条约”。
    社会党还决定，从今天起，把所有的议员都动员到众议院“安全条约”特别委员会中去，并且停止参加其他委员会的审议工作。所有社会党议员并从今天起随时准备出动。
    另一方面，岸信介在17日召集自由民主党全体议员会议，强使各派在原则上接受规定在5月26日以前在国会强行通过新“安全条约”的方针。自由民主党的干事长川岛正次郎17日还向外国记者发表谈话，再次叫嚷要用警察暴力强行通过这个条约。
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎17日晚在东京举行的一次有七百人参加的大会上说，日本人民将竭尽全力来阻止国会强行批准新日美“安全条约”。
    浅沼稻次郎指出，岸信介集团是一批争权夺利的政客的集团，他们只满足于继续当权，即使让整个国家遭受苦难也在所不惜。
    他着重指出，“美国在日本有两百六十个陆军基地和九十个海军基地。这证明日本还没有取得独立的地位”。
    他最后说，“符合日本宪法的外交政策是增进同各国的和平关系、获得和保持独立、恪守不结盟、不向外国提供任何军事基地的外交政策。”
    社会党书记长江田三郎着重指出，“在国会中的多数不能反映实际的大多数人民的意见的时候，像目前的执政党那样的情况，就应当立即解散国会。”
    社会党议员冈田春夫和户叶里子强调指出，新签订的日美“安全条约”对日本的安全和亚洲的和平来说，是一个很大的危险。
    在谈到美国从事间谍活动的U—2型飞机驻扎在日本的问题时，社会党议员石桥政嗣说，当岸信介政府在美国U—2型飞机驻扎在日本的问题还没有向美国政府说“不”的时候，我们怎么能盼望这个政府在美军出动和改变装备问题上的所谓“事先磋商”中会向美国说“不”呢？另一位社会党议员飞鸟田一雄说，美国U—2型飞机驻扎在日本不仅危及日本的安全，而且应当看作是对日本民族的侮辱。

    5月17日，日本文化界人士约六百人到国会示威，要求废除新日美“安全条约”，要求岸信介反动内阁辞职。
