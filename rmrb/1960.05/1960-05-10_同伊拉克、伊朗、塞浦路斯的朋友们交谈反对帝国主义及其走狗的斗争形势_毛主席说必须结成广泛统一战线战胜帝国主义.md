Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th: Chairman Mao Zedong met here this afternoon with friends from the Iraqi Cultural Delegation, the Iraqi Workers' Delegation, the Iranian Trade Union Delegation, and the Cyprus Labor Federation Delegation who are visiting our country.

Chairman Mao Zedong spoke with friends from Iraq, Iran, and Cyprus about the situation and experience of the people of various countries in their struggle against imperialism and its lackeys. Chairman Mao said that the biggest imperialism in the world today is U.S. imperialism, which has its lackeys in many countries. Those supported by imperialism are precisely those despised by the broad masses of the people. People like Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, Nobusuke Kishi, Batista, Said, and Menderes have either been overthrown by the people or will be overthrown by the people. The people of these countries rise up against the lackeys of U.S. imperialism and other imperialisms, which is also to oppose the reactionary rule of imperialism. Chairman Mao said that the Japanese people are taking action, and now the broad masses of the Japanese people are holding demonstrations on a larger scale than in the past to oppose the aggressive military alliance treaty signed by the Kishi Nobusuke government with U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people resolutely support this struggle of the Japanese people. Chairman Mao said that the just struggles of the people of all countries in the world have received and will continue to receive the firm support of the 650 million Chinese people. Chairman Mao said that the life of imperialism will not be long, they have done all kinds of bad things, and the oppressed people all over the world will never forgive them. Chairman Mao said that in order to defeat the reactionary rule of imperialism, it is necessary to form a broad united front, unite all forces that can be united, excluding the enemy, and continue to carry out arduous struggles.

Friends from Iraq, Iran, and Cyprus thanked Chairman Mao for the meeting and conversation, and expressed their willingness to join the Chinese people and the people of the world in jointly opposing imperialism. Finally, Chairman Mao raised his glass to congratulate the further unity of the people of the world, to congratulate the victory of the Japanese people's struggle, and to congratulate the victory of the world's people's struggle against imperialism and its lackeys.

Also present at the meeting today were Yang Shangkun, Alternate Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, and Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and President of the China-Iraq Friendship Association. (Photo attached)
