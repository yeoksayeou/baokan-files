Boiling Tokyo
Twenty Thousand People Hold Unprecedented Demonstration in Japanese History

The Japanese people held an unprecedented demonstration in Japanese history in Tokyo on the 26th. Two hundred thousand angry people, holding countless red flags and banners, surrounded the Diet Building, waving their iron fists and shouting: "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet!" "Dissolve the Diet immediately!" "Abolish the Security Treaty!" The demonstrators also shouted slogans against U.S. imperialism: "Yankees go home!" "U.S. imperialists, get out of Asia!"

This great demonstration dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. The U.S. news agency United Press International exclaimed that yesterday's large-scale demonstrations in Tokyo and throughout the country "reached a terrifying level." The heroic and unyielding Japanese people used this great demonstration to push the powerful movement against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," demanding the dissolution of the Diet and the overthrow of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet to a new climax.

North from Hokkaido, South to Kagoshima,
	Demonstration teams from all over the country arrived

The 26th was the last day of the Sixteenth Unified Action and also the day when the Japanese Diet session should have closed. From the morning, crowds surged from all corners to Hibiya Park like a tide. About 30,000 students from universities and many middle schools in Tokyo first held a meeting in the park demanding the abolition of the new "Security Treaty," the dissolution of the Diet, and the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. Then they marched towards the Diet Building.

At about 3:00 PM, the marching army gathered in the park set off. Behind the student teams were local representatives from all prefectures sent to Tokyo to demonstrate and petition the Diet. They held signs with the names of their prefectures, lined up without omission from Hokkaido in the north to Kagoshima in the south, representing all forty-six prefectures, districts, and municipalities of Japan, demonstrating the breadth of the protest movement. In the ranks of local representatives, many farmers from rural areas could be seen holding flags made of straw mats.

Various unions of government officials, the National Railway Workers' Union, the National Telecommunications Workers' Union and other public utility sectors, and unions of many private enterprises, as well as professors, scholars, writers, actors and actresses, journalists, and people from all walks of life, marched mightily towards the Diet. Among the demonstrators were many university professors and students of church schools who had not been very concerned about political movements in the past, as well as housewives and shopkeepers who had closed their businesses. Kyodo News acknowledged that "the breadth of the classes is remarkable, showing that the struggle to defend peace and democracy has expanded and deepened into all classes of the nation."

Inejiro Asanuma, chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, and Yoshio Shiga, member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, and other representatives of the two parties set up a petition reception office in the Diet to welcome the demonstrating masses.

The angry ocean surrounded the Diet,
		Police were so scared that they cried and trembled

At 4:00 PM, the streets around the Diet were packed with demonstrators. Looking from the dome of the Japanese Diet Building, one could see dense crowds in all directions, surrounding the vast Diet area, with people holding red flags and banners, like a red forest.

Kishi Nobusuke was frightened. The streets around the Diet and the courtyard of the nearby Prime Minister's residence were filled with helmeted police, armored vehicles, and police cars. The atmosphere around the Diet became increasingly tense.

With the connivance of the police, two thugs attacked the leaders of the Socialist Party in front of the Diet. The thugs threw vials containing ammonia, hitting several Socialist Party Diet members, including Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma and former Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki, but they were not injured.

In the face of the upright and imposing demonstration, one policeman suddenly fell to the ground, crying loudly, with tears streaming down his face. He trembled and shouted, "I want to go home." Other police took him away, saying he was clearly overwhelmed by the angry shouts of "Police get out!" and "Let us through!" Other police retreated behind police cars blocking the iron gate leading to the Diet compound.

The demonstrators sat down around the Diet and held a demonstration. The shouts of the masses resounded through the sky, continuously for several hours.

In the evening, the demonstrators split into five groups and held general mobilization rallies in various locations. At each rally, representatives of the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," representatives of Socialist and Communist Party Diet members, and others spoke, calling on the masses to smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, force the Kishi Nobusuke government to step down, and dissolve the Diet. The rallies passed the "Declaration Demanding the Resignation of the Kishi Cabinet and Dissolution of the Diet," as well as "Protests Against Prime Minister Kishi" and "Resolutions Against U.S. President Eisenhower's Visit to Japan."

		Denouncing U.S. imperialism

After the meeting, the masses split into two groups and held a massive demonstration march towards Ginza and Shimbashi Station, the busiest areas of Tokyo. Leading the team were Communist Party Diet member Yoshio Shiga and Socialist Party Diet member Minoru Tanaka. Union members carrying red flags were the main force of the demonstration. The workers marched in formation, and countless union flags fluttered in the wind, emitting a red glow against the bright neon lights.

Spirited and winding, the demonstration continued. Demonstrators marched in an "S" shape, shouting "Oppose the ratification of the Security Treaty!" "Kishi Nobusuke resign immediately!" "Dissolve the Diet immediately!" and "Eisenhower, don't come to Japan!" The pedestrians gathered on both sides responded with storms of applause and shouts. On top of unfinished buildings, people waved flags and flashlights, echoing the slogans shouted by the people. As the demonstrators passed hotels, people dining inside stood up, went to the windows, and cheered the demonstrators.

A group of demonstrators arrived at the plaza in front of Tokyo Station. After shouting slogans, they dispersed in batches. Leaders of the Socialist and Communist parties issued calls to the spirited demonstrators from cars equipped with loudspeakers arranged around the square.

Another group arrived in front of the U.S. Embassy, where they shouted slogans and condemned U.S. imperialism. The gates of the U.S. Embassy were tightly closed, all the windows were shuttered, and only a little light was visible from two windows. A large number of police guarded the gates of the embassy.

Kishi Nobusuke is on the verge of destruction
	The people will advance their movement

When the demonstrators heard on the radio that Kishi Nobusuke was hiding in the Diet Building, the group originally scheduled to march to Shimbashi Station immediately changed their plans and continued to surround the Diet. Terrified, Kishi Nobusuke tried to rush out several times, but was blocked by the demonstrators. He was trapped in the Diet until 10:30 PM, when he escaped from a side door under the protection of a large number of police.

Kozo Mizuguchi, secretary-general of the Japanese "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," estimated the achievements of the Tokyo demonstration and the nationwide unified action, saying, "In Japanese history, today's struggle is unprecedented in terms of strength, scale, and depth."

Mizuguchi Kozo said with confidence: "In Tokyo, 200,000 people participated in the demonstration near the Diet. The total number of demonstrators throughout Japan reached two million. We have brought Kishi Nobusuke to the edge of self-destruction."

He emphasized, "We will advance our movement."

### 沸腾了的东京  二十万群众举行日本历史上空前未有的大示威

    沸腾了的东京
    二十万群众举行日本历史上空前未有的大示威
    日本人民26日在东京举行了日本历史上空前未有的大示威。二十万愤怒的群众高举着无数的红旗和标语牌包围了国会大厦，挥舞着铁拳，高呼：“打倒岸信介内阁！”“立即解散国会！”“废除安全条约！”示威者还高呼反对美帝国主义的口号：“美国佬滚回去！”“美帝国主义者离开亚洲！”
    这次大示威沉重地打击了美日反动派。美国的合众国际社惊呼昨天在东京和全国的大示威“达到了可怕的程度”。英勇不屈的日本人民以这次大示威把反对日美“安全条约”、要求解散国会和打倒岸信介内阁的强大运动推向了新的高潮。
    北起北海道，南至鹿儿岛，
        全国各地的示威队伍都来了
    26日是第十六次统一行动的最后一天，也是日本国会会议应该闭幕的日子。从上午起，人群就像潮水一般地从各个角落涌向日比谷公园。东京各大学和许多中学的共约三万名学生首先在公园里举行了要求废除新“安全条约”、解散国会和岸信介内阁总辞职的大会。然后向国会大厦前进。
    下午三时许，集合在公园里的游行大军开始出发。在学生队伍后面的是各县人民派到东京来向国会示威请愿的地方代表。他们举着写有自己县名的牌子，北起北海道，南至鹿儿岛，日本四十六个都、道、府、县的队伍没有遗漏地排列着，显示了抗议运动的广泛性。在地方代表的队伍里，可以看到许多来自农村的农民高举着用草席做成的旗帜。
    政府机关职员的各个工会、国营铁道工会、全国电气通信工会等各个公用事业部门和许多私营企业的工会，教授、学者、作家、男女演员、新闻工作者等各阶层人民的队伍，浩浩荡荡向国会进发。参加示威的人中有许多过去对政治运动不大关心的大学教授和教会学校的学生，还有家庭主妇和停止营业的店主。共同社承认，“阶层的广泛惹人注目，显示出保卫和平和民主的斗争已经扩展和深入到各阶层国民中间”。
    日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎和日本共产党中央委员志贺义雄等两党议员代表在国会设置了接待请愿处，欢迎示威的群众。
      愤怒的海洋包围了国会，
          警察吓得放声大哭，混身颤抖
    下午四时，国会周围的街道上都挤满了示威者。从日本国会大厦圆拱顶上了望，可以看到四面八方都是密密层层的人群，包围了广阔的国会地区，人们举着的红旗和横幅，像是一片红色的森林。
    岸信介害怕了。国会四周的街道和附近的首相官邸的庭院里挤满了头戴钢盔的警察、装甲车和警车。国会周围的气氛越来越紧张。
    在警察的纵容下，有两个歹徒在国会前面袭击了社会党领袖。打手们扔出装有阿摩尼亚的药瓶，打中几位社会党国会议员，其中包括社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎和前委员长铃木茂三郎，但是他们没有受伤。
    在正气凛冽、声势浩大的示威队伍面前，有一名警察突然倒在地上，放声大哭，泪流满面。他混身颤动着，大声叫喊“我要回家去”。别的警察把他带走，说他显然是因为听到“警察滚开！”和“给我们让路！”等愤怒的喊声而被吓得支持不住了。其他警察也都退到封锁通入国会大院的大铁门前的警车后面。
    示威群众在国会周围就地坐下，举行了示威。群众的口号声响彻云霄，接连不断地持续了好几个小时。
    傍晚，示威群众分为五个地方举行了总奋起大会。在各个大会上，“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”代表、社会党和共产党的议员代表等人讲话，号召群众粉碎日美军事同盟条约、迫使岸信介政府下台和解散国会。各大会通过了“要求岸内阁辞职和解散国会宣言”以及“对岸首相的抗议”、“反对美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本”的决议。
          美国大使馆门前示威，
              怒斥美帝国主义
    大会结束后，群众分为两路，向东京最热闹的地区银座和新桥火车站，举行浩浩荡荡的示威游行。走在队伍前面的是共产党议员志贺义雄和社会党议员田中稔男。拿着红旗的工会会员是示威的主力。工人们列队前进，无数的工会旗帜迎风飘扬，在强烈的霓虹灯光的衬托下，发出一片红色的光辉。
    情绪激昂，蜿蜒而行的示威不断举行下去。示威者排成“S”字队形前进着，高呼“反对批准安全条约！”“岸信介立刻辞职！”“立刻解散国会！”和
  “艾森豪威尔，不要到日本来！”等口号。聚集在两旁的行人报以暴风雨般的掌声和喊声。在尚未盖好的建筑物的顶上有人挥动着旗帜和手电筒，同人们高呼着的口号相呼应。当示威者走过饭店时，在里面用餐的人们站起来，走到窗旁，向示威者欢呼。
    一批示威队伍来到了东京车站前面的广场。他们在高呼口号后分批散开。社会党和共产党领袖从排列在广场周围的装有扩音机的汽车里向情绪激昂的示威者发出号召。
    另一批队伍到达了美国大使馆前面，他们高呼口号，谴责美帝国主义。美国大使馆的大门紧闭着，所有的窗子都下了百叶窗，只有两扇窗露出一点亮光。大批警察守卫着使馆的大门。
          岸信介已临灭亡的边缘
              人民将推进自己的运动
    当示威群众听到广播说，岸信介在国会大厦里躲藏着的时候，原来预定游行到新桥车站的队伍立即改变了行动计划，继续包围国会。被吓得心惊胆战的岸信介几次想冲出去，但都被示威群众堵住。他被围困在国会里，直到深夜十点半，才在大批警察的保护下从一个便门逃出。
    日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”事务局长水口宏三估计东京大示威和全国统一行动的成就时说，“在日本的历史上，今天的斗争就其力量、规模和深度来说都是空前的。”
    水口宏三满怀信心地说：“在东京，二十万人参加了在国会附近的示威。在日本各地示威的总人数达到二百万人。我们已经使岸信介走到自取灭亡的边缘。”
    他强调，“我们将推进我们的运动。”
