More than 10,000 people participated in the rally, including JCP members, family members of members, representatives from joint struggle organizations from various regions, and members of the Democratic Youth League.

    After the chairman of the rally, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party Kenji Miyamoto, announced the start of the rally, he introduced in his speech Chairman Mao Zedong's remarks made on the 14th to the Japanese delegation visiting China regarding China's firm support for the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle. All participants warmly applauded in welcome.

    Miyamoto also reported the news of the successful launch of the Soviet satellite spaceship. At this time, the entire venue resounded with enthusiastic and prolonged applause.

    Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, Sanzō Nosaka, gave a report on the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty."

    Nosaka emphasized that the Japanese people's struggle has been closely linked with the struggles of the Chinese and Korean peoples. Nosaka called on the Japanese people to strengthen their confidence and strive with all their might for victory in the struggle against the ratification of the "Security Treaty."

    Nosaka said that the Japanese people are different from fifteen years ago, and their political consciousness has been greatly improved. They currently possess unprecedentedly strong organizations and rich struggle experience, and are fighting to open a new chapter in Japanese history.

    Nosaka emphasized the importance of the Hiroshima people's adoption of a resolution opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan at the "May Day" International Labor Day rally, and called on the Japanese people to resolutely oppose the U.S. President's visit to Japan.

    Kasuga Shoichi, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, emphasized in his report at the meeting that the South Korean people's patriotic struggle has given unlimited encouragement to the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty." We must strengthen the joint struggle of the Japanese and Korean peoples against the common enemy by victoriously launching the struggle against the "Security Treaty."

    All participants followed Kasuga Shoichi in shouting: "Oppose the Second Puppet Heo Jeong Regime!" "Oppose the resumption of the so-called Japan-ROK talks!" "Yankee Get Out of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and All of Asia!" "Korean and Japanese People Unite and Overthrow U.S. Imperialism!"

    Chairman of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, Han Deok-su, spoke at the meeting. He expressed his gratitude to the Japanese people for supporting the Korean people's struggle and emphasized that the dawn of South Korea will soon arrive, and U.S. imperialism will soon be forced to get out of South Korea and Japan.

    Socialist Party representative Tanaka Toshio, General Council of Trade Unions of Japan representative Yanagimoto Yoshio, Secretary-General of the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" Mizoguchi Kozo, Chairman of the All-Japan Farmers Association Federation Nozoe Katsu, Chairman of the Japan Women's Organizations Federation Kushida Fuki, Vice Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry Associations Seto Moriyuki, and representatives of joint struggle organizations from Tokyo, Osaka, Gunma, and other places spoke at the meeting one after another. They all unanimously expressed their gratitude to the Japanese Communist Party for playing a vanguard role in the Japanese people's struggle, and expressed their belief that today's meeting will give great encouragement to the struggle of the people throughout the country in the future.

    The conference unanimously adopted a declaration. The declaration said that the Japanese people will strengthen their unity with the people of Asian countries, overthrow the U.S. imperialist foundation of domination in Asia, and, with the working class as the vanguard, fight to the end to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism and Japanese imperialism.

    The conference adopted a resolution supporting the patriotic struggle of the South Korean people and a resolution protesting the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" by the Japanese and U.S. governments.

    After the conference, all participants, led by Nosaka and Miyamoto, held a demonstration march in the streets.
