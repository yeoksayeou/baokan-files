	Zhejiang Summarizes and Exchanges Work Experience of Model Production Brigade Party Branches

	(Our newspaper dispatch) The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a work conference of Party branches of model production brigades in the province, summarizing and exchanging the work experience of the Party branches of model production brigades, and discussed how to further carry out the "compare, learn, catch up, and help" movement of branch work, constantly improve the leadership level of the branches, so as to guarantee a better, more comprehensive, and sustained great leap forward in agricultural production this year. More than 200 people attended the meeting, including party branch secretaries of 158 model production brigades throughout the province and comrades from the organization departments of local, municipal, and county committees. Wang Fu, Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. Organization departments of provincial and municipal committees of ten provinces and cities, including Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Beijing, and Shanghai, also sent representatives to participate in the meeting.
	The comrades who attended the meeting first visited 22 model production brigades, including Xinsheng, Zhu Village, Yanli, Qinwang, Wanshi, Xiaohaimen, Lianqun, Huijiang, and Sibanqiao, and the branch work exhibition halls held by various municipal committees. Then, they held a forum. The representatives unanimously believed that this visit was like "climbing a mountain to see the sun," "the more they saw, the more humble they became, and the more they saw, the more motivated they became," which greatly liberated their minds and broadened their horizons. They unanimously believed that the reason why the work of these production brigade party branches was so well done was mainly because they listened to the Party, adhered to the socialist and communist direction; resolutely implemented the Party's general line and various policies; resolutely guaranteed the completion of the various tasks assigned by the state and higher-level organizations; believed in the masses, relied on the masses, vigorously carried out mass movements, and constantly absorbed new experiences created in mass movements to improve the leadership level of the branches. Sibanqiao in Yueqing County, which was known as "nine famines in ten years along the river" before liberation, has made great leaps in production year after year since liberation because the production brigade party branch responded to the Party's call, established lofty ambitions, boldly mobilized the masses, fought against nature, and promoted a series of advanced technical measures. In 1959, the per-mu yield of grain reached 1,894 jin, changing the face of poverty.
	At the meeting, the experiences of carrying out the "compare, learn, catch up, and help" movement of branch work were also summarized and exchanged. In the discussion, everyone realized that the "compare, learn, catch up, and help" movement of branch work is an effective method to continuously improve the leadership level of the branches and ensure the implementation of the general line. Deeply and persistently carrying out the "compare, learn, catch up, and help" movement can continuously strengthen the combat effectiveness of the branches. The experiences of the Party branches of Zhu Village and Yanli in Lin'an County, and Xiaohaimen and Jingtou in Linhai County, in carrying out the "compare, learn, catch up, and help" movement were warmly praised by everyone. These Party branches not only have the lofty ambition to strive for the top in the competition, but more importantly, they have promoted the communist style of "giving convenience to others and leaving difficulties to themselves" and "experience is not kept secret, and advancement does not last overnight." For example, the four production brigade branches of Xiaohaimen and Jingtou have achieved: when one team is advanced, all four teams blossom; when one team has difficulties, all four teams solve them together. In this way, not only did they help the backward catch up with the advanced, but also promoted the advanced to become more advanced, thereby greatly improving the leadership level of the Party branches of the model production brigades.
	During the meeting, many comrades wrote letters and made phone calls to introduce and promote the advanced experience of fraternal branches. Many branches also linked up with each other and carried out competitions. Some county committees held radio conferences or telephone conferences, calling on all production brigade party branches to learn from the model and catch up with the model, and to further carry out the "compare, learn, catch up, and help" competition movement of branch work, thereby promoting the current production and technical innovation movement.
	At the end of the meeting, Zheng Ping, member of the Standing Committee and Minister of the Organization Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a summary. He asked all localities to further strengthen the leadership of rural Party branches, and deeply and persistently carry out the "compare, learn, catch up, and help" movement, so that the leadership level of rural Party branches throughout the province can be universally raised to the leadership level of the Party branches of model production brigades. At the same time, he encouraged everyone to guard against arrogance and rashness, and strive for the more advanced to become even more advanced, so as to better guarantee the realization of a better, more comprehensive, and sustained great leap forward in agricultural production in 1960 organizationally.
	At present, a new upsurge of the "compare, learn, catch up, and help" competition in the work of Party branches is being set off in rural Zhejiang. The advanced experience of the Party branches of the model production brigades will blossom and bear fruit in the more than 29,000 Party branches of the production brigades throughout the province.

    一队有经验　各队齐开花
    浙江总结和交流标兵生产队党支部工作经验
    本报讯　中共浙江省委最近召开了全省农村标兵生产队的党支部工作会议，总结和交流了标兵生产队党支部的工作经验，讨论了如何进一步开展支部工作的“比、学、赶、帮”运动，不断地提高支部的领导水平，以保证今年农业生产更好的全面的持续大跃进。参加会议的有全省一百五十八个标兵生产队的党支部书记和各地、市、县委组织部门的同志共二百多人。中共中央组织部副部长王甫同志，在会上讲了话。河北、山东、河南、安徽、江苏、福建、江西、湖南、北京、上海等十个省、市委组织部，也派代表参加了会议。
    到会同志首先分头参观了新生、朱村、研里、秦望、万市、小海门、联群、汇江、四板桥等二十二个标兵生产队，和各地市委举办的支部工作展览馆，接着进行了座谈。代表们一致认为这次参观好比“登山望日”，“越看越虚心，越看越有劲”，大大解放了思想，开阔了眼界。他们一致认为这些生产队党支部的工作所以搞得好，主要是听党的话，坚持社会主义、共产主义方向；坚决执行党的总路线和各项方针政策；坚决地保证完成国家和上级组织所给予的各项任务；相信群众，依靠群众，大搞群众运动，不断地吸收群众运动中创造的新经验，提高支部领导水平。解放前被称为“沿江十年九荒”的乐清县四板桥，解放以后由于生产队党支部响应党的号召，树立雄心大志，放手发动群众，向自然开战，推行了一系列的先进技术措施，生产年年跃进。1959年粮食亩产达到一千八百九十四斤，改变了贫困面貌。
    会上，还总结交流了开展支部工作“比、学、赶、帮”运动的经验。在讨论中，大家认识到支部工作的“比、学、赶、帮”运动，是不断提高支部领导水平、保证贯彻执行总路线的有效方法，深入持久地开展“比、学、赶、帮”运动，就能不断地加强支部的战斗力。临安县的朱村、研里和临海县的小海门、井头等生产队党支部，开展“比、学、赶、帮”运动的经验，受到了大家的热烈赞扬。这些党支部在竞赛中，不仅有力争上游的雄心大志，更重要的是发扬了“把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己”；“经验不保守，先进不过夜”的共产主义风格。如小海门、井头等四个生产队支部，做到了一队有先进，四队齐开花；一队有困难，四队同解决。这样，不仅帮助后进赶上了先进，而且推动了先进的更先进，从而大大提高了标兵生产队党支部的领导水平。
    会议期间，许多同志都写信、打电话回去介绍和推广兄弟支部的先进经验。不少支部还互相挂钩，开展了竞赛。有些县委召开了广播大会或电话会议，号召所有生产队党支部学标兵、赶标兵，进一步开展支部工作的“比、学、赶、帮”竞赛运动，从而推动了当前的生产和技术革新运动。
    会议最后由中共浙江省委常委、组织部长郑平同志作了总结。他要求各地进一步加强对农村党支部的领导，深入持久地开展“比、学、赶、帮”运动，把全省农村党支部的领导水平普遍地提高到标兵生产队党支部的领导水平。同时勉励大家戒骄戒躁，争取先进的更先进，以便从组织上更好地保证实现1960年农业生产更好的全面的持续大跃进。
    目前，浙江省农村正在掀起党支部工作的“比、学、赶、帮”竞赛的新高潮。各标兵生产队党支部的先进经验，将在全省两万九千多个生产队党支部中开花结果。
