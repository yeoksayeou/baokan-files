    China's Democratic Parties Support Soviet Statement
    Leaders of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, the Democratic League and other eight democratic parties issued statements respectively
    The Chinese people stand with the Soviet people to resolutely fight against U.S. imperialism
    On May 18, leaders of China's democratic parties issued statements one after another, unanimously supporting Khrushchev's statement, severely condemning the U.S. imperialist aggression policy, and expressing that the Chinese people will always stand with the Soviet people and fight to the end to overthrow U.S. imperialism and defend world peace. They are: He Xiangning, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League; Huang Yanpei, Director of the China Democratic National Construction Association; Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy; Heads of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party; Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society; and Xu Mengshan, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League.
     Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
    Xinhua News Agency, May 18th He Xiangning, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, issued a statement today, firmly supporting the statement made by Chairman Khrushchev of the Soviet Council of Ministers at the preparatory meeting of the Four Powers Summit.
    He Xiangning said that U.S. imperialism is the public enemy of all peace-loving countries and people in the world, and Eisenhower is the No. 1 war-monger in the United States. The recent incident of Eisenhower sending a U-2 spy plane to invade the Soviet Union once again provides ironclad proof. This incident fully shows that the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism will not change, and there must be no unrealistic illusions about it; the attainment of world peace can only be achieved by the people of the world uniting and carrying out a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism.
    He Xiangning said that the U.S. imperialist provocation against the Soviet Union is also a provocation against our country. We Chinese people will always stand with the Soviet people and fight for world peace, against aggression, and to overthrow U.S. imperialism!
      China Democratic League
    Xinhua News Agency, May 18th Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, issued a statement today, firmly supporting the statement made by Chairman Khrushchev of the Soviet Council of Ministers at the preparatory meeting of the Four Powers Summit.
    Shen Junru said that Eisenhower once wanted to use the guise of peace to deceive the people of the world, while sending spy planes to invade Soviet airspace to carry out provocative activities. Now that the thief's hand has been caught and the guise of peace has been completely shattered, the reactionary essence of U.S. imperialism is once again exposed before the people of the world, reminding the people of the world that they must not have any unrealistic illusions about U.S. imperialism. Eisenhower is a No. 1 war-monger, and U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the world.
    Shen Junru said that the Chinese people will always stand with the Soviet people. We resolutely oppose all war threats and military provocations of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism will not easily abandon its war policy and aggression policy. We must be vigilant and resolutely and ruthlessly expose its aggressive conspiracies to the people of the world. The Chinese people and the Soviet people will unite more closely and fight to the end to overthrow U.S. imperialism and defend world peace!
      China Democratic National Construction Association
    Xinhua News Agency, May 18th Huang Yanpei, Director of the China Democratic National Construction Association, issued a statement today, firmly supporting the solemn statement made by Chairman Khrushchev of the Soviet Council of Ministers at the preparatory meeting of the Four Powers Summit.
    Huang Yanpei said that the incident of the U.S. spy plane invading Soviet airspace once again proves that U.S. imperialism is the most stubborn and ferocious enemy of the people of the world, and Eisenhower is the head of an openly armed robber. The nature of imperialism will not change. In order to oppose imperialist aggression and defend world peace, we must thoroughly expose the ugly face of U.S. imperialism and Eisenhower. Only by carrying out a resolute struggle against imperialism can we achieve true peace.
    Huang Yanpei said that the downing of the U.S. spy plane in Soviet airspace and the publication of Chairman Khrushchev's statement are a ruthless and heavy blow to U.S. imperialism. We Chinese people have always been the closest comrades and brothers of the Soviet people. The enemy of the Soviet people is our enemy, and the provocation against the Soviet Union is a provocation against us. We must unite more closely with the Soviet people and fight to smash all aggressive conspiracies of imperialism and defend world peace.
    China Association for Promoting Democracy
    Xinhua News Agency, May 18th Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, told Xinhua reporters that we firmly support Chairman Khrushchev's solemn statement at the preparatory meeting of the Paris Four Powers Summit. The provocative act of the United States sending spy planes to invade Soviet airspace fully exposed the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism. Faced with Chairman Khrushchev's stern condemnation of him, the government not only showed no remorse, but instead counterattacked, brazenly undermining the Four Powers Summit. We feel extremely angry about this.
    Wang Shao'ao said that a wolf is always a wolf. Imperialism is always imperialism. The aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism will not change. All members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, together with the people of the whole country, will always be closely united with the Soviet people and resolutely fight to the end to overthrow U.S. imperialism and defend lasting world peace.
    Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party
    Xinhua News Agency, May 18th The person in charge of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party issued a statement today, condemning the United States for sending military aircraft to invade the Soviet Union for espionage activities, and expressing firm support for Khrushchev's statement on May 16.
    The person in charge of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party said: "U.S. imperialism is the common mortal enemy of the people of the world. It has always adhered to the policy of arms expansion and war preparation, stepped up the formation of military blocs, established military bases everywhere, supported reactionary regimes, carried out subversive activities, and on the eve of the Four Powers Summit, it even sent military aircraft to carry out despicable espionage activities in Soviet airspace. Eisenhower is by no means a "peace envoy," but the No. 1 war-monger. All members of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party firmly support Chairman Khrushchev's just stand of condemning U.S. imperialism at the preparatory meeting of the Four Powers Summit, and severely warn Eisenhower: If U.S. imperialism does not abandon its aggressive ambitions and insists on its war policy, we will, together with the Soviet people and the peace-loving people of the world, fight to the end to resolutely defend world peace against U.S. imperialism."
    China Zhi Gong Party
    Xinhua News Agency, May 18th Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, issued a statement today, supporting the statement of Chairman Khrushchev of the Soviet Council of Ministers on May 16.
    Chen Qiyou said that the incident of the United States sending a spy plane to invade Soviet territory for military reconnaissance on May 1 this year further exposed the hideous aggressive face of the U.S. imperialists. He said: "On May 16, when Chairman Khrushchev of the Soviet Council of Ministers sternly condemned the United States' aggressive behavior at the preparatory meeting of the Four Powers Summit, Eisenhower still insisted on his bandit logic and aggressive policy. This bandit crime of the U.S. imperialists completely destroyed the Four Powers Summit, which the people of the world had placed high hopes on, and completely exposed its unchanging imperialist nature."
    Chen Qiyou said: "Like all Chinese people, I feel extremely indignant at this aggressive crime of the U.S. government and Eisenhower. On behalf of all members of the China Zhi Gong Party, I express my full support for Chairman Khrushchev's solemn statement condemning the United States for adhering to its aggressive policy and undermining the Four Powers Conference. We sternly warn the U.S. government and Eisenhower: Aggression against the Soviet Union is aggression against China, and is aggression against the entire socialist camp. We Chinese people and the people of socialist countries stand firmly with the Soviet people, are always vigilant against any aggressive behavior of the imperialists, and will fight to the end against U.S. imperialist aggression and to defend world peace."
    China Jiusan Society
    Xinhua News Agency, May 18th Xu Deheng, Chairman of the China Jiusan Society, issued a statement today saying: "All members of the Jiusan Society fully support the solemn statement made by Chairman Khrushchev of the Soviet Council of Ministers on May 16 at the preparatory meeting of the Four Powers Summit, and fully support the solemn protest of the Soviet people against the aggressive atrocities of U.S. imperialism."
    Xu Deheng said: "The sinful acts of U.S. imperialism in sending spy planes to invade the Soviet Union, undermining the convening of the Four Powers Summit, and undermining world peace have once again exposed its sinister face of false peace and true war preparation, and also proved that the aggressive nature of imperialism will not change. The great Soviet people can completely smash the aggressive provocations of U.S. imperialism, and the people of all countries in the socialist camp and the peace-loving people of the world stand firmly on the side of the Soviet people."
    He said: "The life of imperialism will not be very long, but imperialism will not wait for its own demise. We must further heighten our vigilance, strengthen our unity, and fight to the end to defend world peace, and to oppose the aggressive atrocities and war conspiracies of U.S. imperialism."
    Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League
    Xinhua News Agency, May 18th Xu Mengshan, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, told Xinhua reporters today that he firmly supports the statement made by Chairman Khrushchev of the Soviet Council of Ministers at the preparatory meeting of the Four Powers Summit.
    He said that on the eve of the Four Powers Summit, U.S. imperialism sent a U-2 military aircraft to invade Soviet airspace, and after this aggressive act was exposed, it openly stated that it would continue to invade Soviet territory in the future. This fully proves that the U.S. government is deliberately undermining the Four Powers Summit. Chairman Khrushchev's statement demanding that the U.S. government guarantee that it will not carry out such provocative activities again, and that the personnel responsible for this should be punished, is a completely reasonable and just position.
    Xu Mengshan said that the U.S. imperialists are pursuing their war policy under the smoke screen of peace, which is not only proven by this aircraft provocation incident, but also fully proven by the fact that they sent armed forces to occupy our territory of Taiwan, constantly sent aircraft and warships to invade our airspace and territorial waters as many as 96 times, and Eisenhower constantly issued war cries against our country.
    Xu Mengshan said that the people of Taiwan, who are fighting to bring Taiwan back to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible, deeply realize that U.S. imperialism is the No. 1 enemy of world peace and the most ferocious enemy of the Taiwanese people. He said that we are determined to stand forever with the 650 million people of the motherland, together with the Soviet people, to fight to the end to overthrow U.S. imperialism and liberate Taiwan.

    王绍鏊说，狼总是狼。帝国主义总是帝国主义。美帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的。我们中国民主促进会全体会员，和全国人民一道，永远同苏联人民紧密团结在一起，为打倒美帝国主义，保卫世界持久和平而坚决斗争到底。
    中国农工民主党
    新华社18日讯　中国农工民主党中央委员会负责人今天发表声明，谴责美国派遣军用飞机侵入苏联进行间谍活动，并且表示坚决支持赫鲁晓夫5月16日的声明。
    中国农工民主党中央负责人说：“美帝国主义是全世界人民共同的死敌，它一贯坚持扩军备战政策，加紧拼凑军事集团，到处建立军事基地，扶植反动政权，进行颠覆活动，在四国政府首脑会议前夕，更派遣军用飞机在苏联领空进行卑鄙的间谍活动。艾森豪威尔决不是什么“和平使者”，而是第一号战争贩子。中国农工民主党的全体成员坚决支持赫鲁晓夫主席在四国政府首脑会议预备会议上谴责美帝国主义的严正立场，并且严重警告艾森豪威尔：如果美帝国主义不放弃侵略野心，坚持战争政策，我们将同苏联人民和全世界爱好和平人民一起，为坚决保卫世界和平而与美帝国主义斗争到底。”

    新华社18日讯　中国致公党主席陈其尤今天发表声明，支持苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫5月16日的声明。
    陈其尤说，今年5月1日美国派遣间谍飞机侵入苏联国境进行军事侦察的事件，更加暴露了美帝国主义者狰狞的侵略面目。他说：“5月16日当苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在四国首脑会议预备会议上严正谴责美国的侵略行为时，艾森豪威尔还坚持他的强盗逻辑和侵略政策。美帝国主义者这种强盗罪行彻底破坏了世界各国人民寄予殷切期望的四国首脑会议，彻底暴露了他的不会改变的帝国主义的本性。”
    陈其尤说：“对于美国政府和艾森豪威尔的这种侵略罪行，我和全中国人民一样感到无比的愤慨，我谨代表中国致公党全体成员表示完全支持赫鲁晓夫主席谴责美国坚持侵略政策破坏四国会议的严正声明，我们严正地警告美国政府和艾森豪威尔：侵略苏联就是侵略中国，就是侵略整个社会主义阵营，我们中国人民和社会主义各国人民一起，坚决站在苏联人民一边，随时警惕着帝国主义者的任何侵略行为，并为反对美帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平而斗争到底。”

    他说，美帝国主义在四国首脑会议召开的前夕，派U—2式军用飞机侵犯苏联领空，并在这种侵略行动被揭露后，公然声称它今后还要继续侵犯苏联国境，这就充分证明美国政府是蓄意破坏四国首脑会议。赫鲁晓夫主席声明要求美国政府保证不再进行这种挑衅活动，并且应该惩罚对此负责的人员，这是完全合理的严正立场。
    徐萌山说，美国帝国主义在和平的烟幕下推行它的战争政策，不但在这次飞机挑衅事件中得到证明，而且，从它派武装力量侵占我国领土台湾，不断派飞机、军舰侵犯我国领空领海达九十六次之多，艾森豪威尔不断发出对我国的战争叫嚣等等事实中，也得到了充分的证明。
    徐萌山说，为争取台湾早日回到祖国怀抱而斗争着的台湾人民，切身体会到美帝国主义是世界和平的第一号敌人，也是台湾人民的最凶恶的敌人。他说，我们坚决和祖国六亿五千万人民一道，永远同苏联人民站在一起，为打倒美帝国主义，为解放台湾而奋斗到底。
