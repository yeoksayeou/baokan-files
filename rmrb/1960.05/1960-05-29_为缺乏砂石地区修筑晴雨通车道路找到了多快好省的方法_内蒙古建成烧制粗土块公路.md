Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, May 28th: The first all-weather road in China paved with fired clay blocks has recently been completed between Shanba Town in Hangjin Houqi and Linhe County in the Hetao Plain of Inner Mongolia. This provides a fast, efficient, and economical method for building all-weather roads in areas lacking sand and gravel.

The Shanlin Highway from Shanba Town to Linhe County is an important transportation artery in the Hetao Plain. Originally a dirt road, its surface was uneven with potholes. It experienced spring thaw heaving and was muddy during the rainy season, making travel difficult. Two years ago, the local people prepared to build a sand and gravel road, but this could not be resolved due to the lack of sand and gravel in the area. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the leaders of relevant departments in Hangjin Houqi and Linhe County have led the local people to break down superstitions, display the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, take local materials, adapt to local conditions, and use the local method of building lime kilns to construct earth kilns near the highway. They boldly experimented with firing rough clay blocks to pave the road surface.

During the experiment, they received attention and strong support from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the central transportation departments, which sent engineers and technicians to participate in the experiment. The fired clay blocks, after scientific evaluation and typical experiments, proved to have the advantages of being solid, pressure-resistant, and capable of absorbing and releasing moisture, and could completely replace sand and gravel. The cost per kilometer was more than two-thirds less than that of a sand and gravel road. Moreover, the firing of rough clay blocks could be done with local materials, simple equipment, and operating techniques that are easy for the masses to master, allowing for mass production in a short period of time.

From May 12th to 19th, relevant departments of the Ministry of Communications held an on-site meeting in Linhe County. Representatives from many provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities studied the experience of building roads with fired clay blocks. They unanimously agreed that this is a fast, efficient, and economical method for building all-weather roads in areas lacking sand and gravel.

    为缺乏砂石地区修筑晴雨通车道路找到了多快好省的方法
    内蒙古建成烧制粗土块公路
    据新华社呼和浩特28日电　内蒙古河套平原杭锦后旗陕坝镇到临河县城之间，最近建成我国第一条晴雨通车的由烧制粗土块铺成的公路，为缺乏砂石地区修筑晴雨通车道路找到了多、快、好、省的方法。
    陕坝镇到临河县的陕临公路是河套平原的重要交通干线。原来是一条土路，路面坑洼不平，春季翻浆，雨季泥泞，很难行车。两年前，当地人民就准备修筑一条砂石路面公路，但因当地没有砂石而不能解决。1958年大跃进以来，杭锦后旗和临河县有关部门领导当地人民破除迷信，发挥敢想敢干的共产主义风格，就地取材，因地制宜，在公路附近用当地群众烧石灰的土办法建筑土窑，大胆试验烧制粗土块，铺成公路路面。
    试验中，得到了内蒙古自治区和中央交通部门的重视和大力支持，并派来工程师和技术人员参加试验工作。烧制出的粗土块经过科学鉴定和典型试验，证明具有坚固、耐压、能吸水散发水份等优点，完全可以代替砂石。每公里造价却比砂石路面节省资金三分之二以上。而且，烧制粗土块可以就地取材，设备简单，操作技术容易为群众掌握，能在短期内大量生产。
    5月12日至19日，交通部有关部门在临河县召开现场会议。许多省、区、市代表学习了这里修筑烧粗土块路面公路的经验，一致认为，这是缺乏砂石地区修筑晴雨通车道路的多快好省的方法。
