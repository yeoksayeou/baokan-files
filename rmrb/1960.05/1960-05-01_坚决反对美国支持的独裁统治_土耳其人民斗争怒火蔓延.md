    Resolutely Oppose the U.S.-Backed Dictatorial Rule
    Turkish People's Struggle Spreads Like Wildfire
    Students in Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir Demonstrate
    Government Deploys Large Numbers of U.S.-Made Tanks to Suppress Demonstrations; More Than a Hundred Students Killed and Injured in Ankara
    Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch from Ankara: Demonstrations against the reactionary government of Menderes are spreading throughout Turkey. Approximately one thousand students in Izmir, a major city in western Turkey, demonstrated in front of the local governor's residence on the 29th.
    On the same day, ten thousand students in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, held another demonstration at Istanbul University. They shouted slogans such as "Down with the Dictator."
    Students from the Faculty of Political Science and the Faculty of Law at Ankara University gathered in front of the Faculty of Political Science building on the 29th, demanding Menderes' resignation.
    The Ankara military commander dispatched armed forces to surround the university buildings, ordering the students to disperse.
    But the students refused to disperse. Thereupon, the military authorities immediately summoned the fire brigade, attempting to disperse them with water hoses. The students resisted this attack and retreated into the Law School building.
    Under the cover of rifle fire, the army and police forces attacked the building, broke down the doors, and stormed inside. The students used tables and chairs to resist attacks from rifle butts and tear gas.
    It is reported that at least one hundred people were injured and many others killed in the Ankara demonstrations.
    All faculty members of Istanbul University have expressed their intention to resign in protest against the government's bloody suppression of student demonstrations. Principal Sidik Sami Omar said that two hundred faculty members will resign "unless our dead are brought back to life."
    However, the Menderes government continues to use force to suppress this outburst of popular anger and protest against the Menderes government's policy of submitting to U.S. imperialism. The Menderes government, taking advantage of the ruling party's majority in the National Assembly, passed a decree stipulating the imposition of martial law in Ankara and Istanbul for three months.
    Ankara University and Istanbul University have been ordered closed for one month by the local martial law commander.
    Several opposition newspapers in Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir have been closed down.
    United Press International, in a report from Istanbul on the Menderes government's preparations, with U.S. support, for further suppression of demonstrations, said, "Eighty U.S.-made tanks are heading to the university to confront three thousand students who have erected barricades."
    Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch from Istanbul: Terrified by the angry student demonstrations, the Turkish Menderes government mobilized tanks and a large number of military police this morning to carry out suppression.
    Despite the Turkish government's order imposing three months of martial law in Ankara and Istanbul, more than two thousand students at Istanbul University continued to demonstrate on campus this morning, protesting against the government's reactionary measures. Large numbers of military police and tanks were dispatched to surround the school and coerce the students to disperse. When the students refused this demand, fully armed soldiers charged through the school gate with bayonets fixed, forcibly dragged the students out of the campus, and then transported them by truck to concentration camps outside the city.
    According to the Associated Press, the students, despite having endured two days and nights of demonstrations and struggle, still appeared spirited. As they were being loaded onto the trucks, they shouted slogans and sang patriotic songs in unison.
    Istanbul was shrouded in an atmosphere of terror and tension throughout the day. Armed soldiers were everywhere on the streets as if facing a major enemy, and the rumble of tanks and armored vehicles could be heard continuously. Helicopters were also circling at low altitude. The situation was even more tense around the New City Hall in the city center, as the leaders of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc are scheduled to meet here on May 2nd to discuss new "Cold War" conspiracies. Western news agency reporters described this area in their reports as "a veritable barracks." Sentries were posted every three steps and every five steps. Mobile motorcycle units, tense and ready to depart at any moment, could be seen along the streets.
    This afternoon, even in this heavily guarded area, more than a thousand young people and students held demonstrations and attempted to break through the cordon.
    The Menderes government is now like a frightened bird. According to reports from Ankara, the Turkish capital is also in a tense wartime atmosphere today. Squads of military police are patrolling the streets. All government agencies and important buildings, including post and telecommunications offices and railway stations, are guarded by troops.

    坚决反对美国支持的独裁统治
    土耳其人民斗争怒火蔓延
    安卡拉、伊斯坦布尔、伊兹密尔学生示威
    政府出动大批美制坦克镇压　安卡拉学生死伤百余人
    新华社30日讯　安卡拉消息：反对曼德列斯反动政府的示威正在土耳其扩展开来。土耳其西部主要城市伊兹密尔的大约一千名学生29日在地方长官的官邸前举行了示威。
    同一天，土耳其最大城市伊斯坦布尔的一万名学生又在伊斯坦布尔大学举行示威。他们高呼“打倒独裁者”的口号。
    安卡拉大学政治科学院和法学院的学生29日聚集在政治科学院校舍的前面，要求曼德列斯辞职。
    安卡拉军事长官派遣武装部队包围了大学的校舍，命令学生散开。
    但学生们拒绝散开。于是军事当局立即叫来了消防队，企图用水龙头将他们驱散。学生们抵抗了这种进攻，并撤退到法学院的大楼中去。
    在步枪火力的掩护下，陆军和警察部队进攻大楼，打掉了大门，冲了进去。学生们用桌椅来抵抗枪托和催泪弹的攻击。
    据报道，在安卡拉示威中，至少有一百人受伤，还有不少人死亡。
    伊斯坦布尔大学的全体教职员工都表示要辞职，抗议政府血腥镇压学生示威。校长西迪克·萨米·奥马尔说，“除非把我们的死者的生命还给我们”，否则，两百位教职员工将辞职。
    但是，曼德列斯政府仍继续用武力镇压这次爆发的人民对曼德列斯政府屈从美帝国主义的政策所表示的愤怒和抗议。曼德列斯政府借执政党在国民议会中的多数通过法令，规定在安卡拉和伊斯坦布尔实施戒严三个月。
    安卡拉大学和伊斯坦布尔大学被当地戒严司令勒令封闭一个月。
    安卡拉、伊斯坦布尔和伊兹密尔的一些反对党报纸都被封闭了。
    合众国际社在从伊斯坦布尔报道曼德列斯政府在美国支持下准备进一步镇压示威的情况时说，“八十辆美国造的坦克开往大学，去对付筑起障碍物的三千名学生。”
    新华社30日讯　伊斯坦布尔消息：被愤怒的学生示威吓坏了的土耳其曼德列斯政府，今天早晨出动了坦克和大批军警进行镇压。
    尽管土耳其政府发布了命令，在安卡拉和伊斯坦布尔实施三个月的戒严，伊斯坦布尔大学的二千多名学生今天早晨继续在校园内举行示威，抗议政府的反动措施。大批的军警和坦克被派去包围学校，并胁迫学生解散。当学生拒绝了这个要求之后，全副武装的兵士端着上了刺刀的步枪冲进学校大门，用武力把学生拖出校园，然后用卡车把他们押送到城外的集中营去。
    据美联社报道，学生们虽然经过了两昼夜的示威和斗争，看起来仍然精神抖擞。当他们被押上卡车运走时，还高喊口号和齐声唱着爱国的歌曲。
    今天一整天伊斯坦布尔城笼罩在恐怖和紧张的气氛中。街上到处是如临大敌的武装士兵，不断传来坦克和装甲车的隆隆声。直升飞机也在低空盘旋飞行。在市中心的新市府大楼周围，形势更为紧张，因为北大西洋侵略集团的头目们5月2日就要在这里开会，讨论新的“冷战”阴谋。西方通讯社的记者在他们的报道中把这个地区描写成“一个道地的兵营”。三步一哨，五步一岗。沿大街都可以看到紧张的、随时待命出发的机动摩托车队。
    今天下午，就在这个戒备森严的地区又有一千多名青年和学生举行示威，并试图冲破警戒线。
    曼德列斯政府已如惊弓之鸟。据安卡拉消息，这个土耳其的首都今天也陷于紧张的战时空气中。一队队的军警沿街巡逻。所有的政府机构和包括邮电局和车站等重要的建筑都有军队驻守。（附图片）
