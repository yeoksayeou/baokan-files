Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch: Literary and art circles in various regions are welcoming the National Congress of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education with a large number of new films, new plays, new songs, etc.

Film studios in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places are creating and filming excellent new films reflecting the victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes; and the achievements of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, as gifts to the city and national representatives of advanced workers in culture and education. The creative staff of the Beijing Film Studio's advanced collective, the "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" production team, which is attending the National Congress of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education, recently used the style of filming this film to quickly write and begin filming the feature film "Spring Blossoms," which reflects the story of the urban People's Commune. On the eve of the conference, the film studio also completed the color feature film "Colorful Road," which reflects the new life of Tibetan children, and the color opera art film "The Women Generals of the Yang Family," which is entirely starred by the new forces in the opera world. The "The Women Generals of the Yang Family" production team created a new record for the entire studio during the filming process, shooting eighty-three shots in one day, with an effective length of eight hundred and thirty-two meters. This length is equal to a quarter of the total length of the film. The Shanghai Tianma Film Studio is filming a documentary reflecting the Great Leap Forward in Shanghai's cultural and educational front as a gift to the conference. This film runs through the entire film with Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle. The Haiyan Film Studio will make a good color feature film "Moya Dai" as a gift. The Fine Arts Film Studio will shoot an ink and wash animation film, a paper folding film, and a set of fine arts films reflecting the technological revolution. The Science and Education Film Studio will shoot the science and education film "Flying to the Sky," as well as six educational films and a slide film. The Xi'an Film Studio rushed to produce a documentary film "The Red Flag of Technological Innovation Waves," in three days as a gift to the conference. It is now being shown in Xi'an.

Theatrical circles in various regions are actively creating and performing plays reflecting real life and struggles to welcome the Congress of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education.

The Shandong Lu Opera Research Institute Experimental Troupe performed "Waist Chop of the Yellow River," reflecting the great spirit of the people of Shandong Province in controlling the Yellow River and creating happiness for ten thousand years. The large-scale Lu Opera "High Flying the Red Flag" by the Shandong Lu Opera Research Institute, which reflects the magnificent mass movement of water conservancy construction in rural Shandong Province, portrays the vivid image of a Communist Party member, Dashan, who leads the masses to open mountains and split ridges. The Shandong Provincial Drama Troupe is staging a large-scale drama "An Old Red Army" in various places. This play was collectively created under the specific instructions of the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee, and was well received when it was performed in Beijing not long ago.

Following the May performance of units directly under it, the Beijing art circles successively held a performance by young opera actors and a performance by district units, showing the great harvest and improvement of art workers' political thought and artistic creation. The large-scale Ping Opera "Ode to Life," created by the China Ping Opera House, an advanced collective that will attend this conference, using a combination of professional and amateur authors, has been performed for a month and is fully booked. Another advanced collective that will attend the conference, the Central Academy of Drama Experimental Drama Theater, recently launched a mass technological innovation campaign. The stage workers produced a semi-automatic plate cutting machine and installed wheels under the heavy scenery, which greatly reduced physical labor and improved the efficiency of stage work.

More than 30 professional opera troupes of Beijing Opera, Ping Opera, Bangzi Opera, Yue Opera, Henan Opera, Drama, Song and Dance, etc. in Tianjin have generally carried out the creation, rehearsal and performance of modern dramas. In May, according to incomplete statistics, there are more than 20 modern dramas that have been staged and will be staged successively, and dozens more are being created, processed and sorted out. These plays reflect the technological revolution and the People's Commune movement from different angles, praise the three red flags, promote the communist spirit, and are of educational significance. Therefore, after the premiere, it has attracted widespread attention from audiences in all walks of life. Many factories, people's communes, shops, and schools have regarded these dramas as figurative teaching materials and have organized employees, commune members, teachers, and students to watch them. Many viewers also wrote letters and commentaries to performing units, newspapers, and magazines to recommend and praise these dramas. The modern dramas that appeared on the opera stage during this period, whether it was Beijing Opera, Ping Opera, or Yue Opera, generally maintained the characteristics of the opera, but they were not limited to tradition, and there were many innovations and creations.

In other aspects of the literary and art front, a climax of tributes has also appeared. Nanjing Art Academy created 43 extremely exquisite clay sculptures, carvings, lacquerware, embroidery, and blue borders, as well as more than 90 songs in a short period of time. Among the gifts from Suzhou Prefecture, double-sided pith paper pile flowers, double-sided machine embroidery, wood flower clippings, and artificial gemstones are all new products this year.

    歌唱新时代　歌唱新人物
    文艺界以大批新影片新剧目献给文教群英会
    新华社29日讯　各地文艺界以大批新影片、新剧目、新歌曲等，迎接全国文教先进工作者代表大会。
    北京、上海等地电影制片厂正在创作和拍摄反映总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利；技术革命、文化革命的成就等优秀新片，向全市和全国文教先进工作者代表大会献礼。北京电影制片厂出席全国文教先进工作者代表大会的先进集体“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”摄制组的创作人员，最近又以摄制这部影片的风格，迅速编写并且开始拍摄反映城市人民公社的故事片“春暖花开”。大会前夕，这个电影制片厂又完成了反映藏族儿童新生活的彩色故事片“五彩路”和完全由戏曲界新生力量主演的彩色戏曲艺术片“杨门女将”。“杨门女将”摄制组在拍摄工作中创造了一天拍摄八十三个镜头、有效长度八百三十二米的全厂新纪录。这个长度等于全片长度的四分之一。上海天马制片厂正在摄制一部反映上海文教战线大跃进面貌的纪录片向大会献礼，这部影片以毛泽东思想为纲贯串全剧。海燕电影制片厂将以拍好彩色故事片“摩雅傣”，作为献礼。美术电影制片厂将拍摄一本水墨动画片、一本折纸片和一组以反映技术革命为内容的美术片。科学教育电影制片厂将拍摄科学教育片“飞向天空”等以及六部教育片和一部幻灯片。西安电影制片厂为了向大会献礼，突击三天制出了一部纪录影片“技术革新红旗飘”。现已在西安市上演。
    各地戏剧界积极创作、演出反映现实生活和斗争的剧目，迎接文教先进工作者代表大会。
    山东省鲁剧研究院实验剧团排演“腰斩黄河”，反映山东省人民根治黄河、造福万年的伟大气概。山东省鲁剧研究院吕剧团的以反映山东省农村兴修水利的波澜壮阔的群众运动为主题的大型吕剧“红旗高举”，刻划了共产党员大山领导群众开山劈岭的干部的生动形象。山东省话剧团正在各地上演大型话剧“一个老红军”，这个戏是在省委负责同志的具体指示下集体创作的，不久前在北京演出时受到好评。
    北京艺术界继直属单位5月会演之后，连续举行了戏曲青年演员会演和区属单位会演，显示出艺术工作者们政治思想和艺术创作的大丰收、大提高。将出席这次大会的先进集体中国评剧院采取专业、业余作者相结合办法创作的大型评剧“生活的凯歌”连演一个月，场场客满。另一个将出席大会的先进集体中央戏剧学院实验话剧院最近开展了群众性的技术革新运动，布景工人制作出半自动化切板机，在笨重景片下安装了车轮，大大减轻了体力劳动，提高了舞台工作效率。
    天津京、评、梆、越、豫、话剧、歌舞等剧种的三十多个专业戏曲团体，普遍开展了现代剧的创作、排演活动。在5月间，已经上演和即将陆续上演的现代剧据不完全统计，有二十多个，还有几十个正在创作、加工整理。这些剧目，从不同的角度，反映了技术革命大风暴和人民公社运动，歌颂了三面红旗，宣扬了共产主义思想风貌，富有教育意义。因此公演以后，引起了各行各业观众的广泛注意。许多工厂、人民公社、商店、学校把这些戏当作形象化的教材，纷纷组织职工、社员和教师、学生前去观看。许多观众还给演出单位、报刊杂志写信、写评介文章，推荐、赞扬这些戏。这一时期出现在戏曲舞台上的现代剧，无论京剧、评剧或是越剧，一般都保持了本剧种的特色，但也并不拘泥于传统，而有了不少的革新和创造。
    在文艺战线的其他方面，同样出现了献礼的高潮。南京艺术学院短期内创作出极为精美的泥塑、雕刻、漆器、刺绣、蓝边等四十三件，歌曲九十余首。苏州专区的礼品中，双面通草堆花、双面机绣、木花剪贴、人造宝石等都是今年的新产品。
