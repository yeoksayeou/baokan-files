    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 17th. The people of small and medium-sized towns in Heilongjiang Province, who spent fourteen years of hardship under the iron heel of Japanese fascist bandits, have held nearly one million strong rallies and marches in recent days to support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.
    From Qiqihar to Mudanjiang, from Jiamusi in the Hejiang Plain to Yichun, a forest city in the Lesser Khingan Mountains, to the coal mining city of Shuangyashan, angry shouts of "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!" and "Unite the Chinese and Japanese people to overthrow U.S. imperialism!" have resounded everywhere in recent days.
    In Qiqihar City, 280,000 people from all walks of life held a grand rally and demonstration on the afternoon of May 14th. Zhang Pujia, Secretary of the Qiqihar Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said at the meeting: The people of Qiqihar City will never forget the fourteen years of blood and hatred inflicted by the Japanese fascist bandits. We will never allow history to repeat itself and will resolutely oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty together with the Japanese people. He said that the Japanese people's struggle is by no means isolated, and final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people.
    In Mudanjiang City, 170,000 people held a rally and demonstration on May 14th. Li Youlin, Secretary of the Mudanjiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and First Secretary of the Mudanjiang Municipal Committee, said at the meeting: The flames of struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are burning everywhere in the world. The noose around the neck of U.S. imperialism is constantly tightening. If U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism dare to launch a war, they will surely suffer a crushing defeat.
    Jiamusi City, which was once used as a "supply base" by the Japanese invaders, held a rally and demonstration of 120,000 people on May 16th. Zhao Yunpeng, Secretary of the Hejiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and First Secretary of the Jiamusi Municipal Committee, said in his speech: The people of Jiamusi still have vivid memories of the atrocities of Japanese imperialism and will never forget the disasters brought to us by Japanese imperialism's fourteen years of rule in the Northeast. We resolutely support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the United States and resolutely overthrow U.S. imperialism.
    Ten thousand forestry workers and members of urban people's communes in the Yichun forest area in the Lesser Khingan Mountains held a grand rally on the afternoon of May 16th in the rain to support the Japanese people's opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. Wang Chongjiu, a member of the Yichun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, condemned at the meeting the towering crimes of U.S. imperialism in fostering Japanese militarism and threatening Asian and world peace, and expressed the firm support of all forestry workers in Yichun City for the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle.
    In the coal mining city of Shuangyashan, 150,000 people also held rallies and demonstrations on May 15th.

    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, May 17th. More than 4,000 workers from the Xi'an Instrument Factory held rallies today to resolutely oppose the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy to plan a new war and to firmly support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.
    The vast majority of the factory's veteran workers were transferred from the Northeast or East China. They have vivid memories of the Japanese imperialists' enslavement and oppression of our people, and unanimously stated that they will never allow Japanese militarism to make a comeback. Shen Bingwen, a worker in the surface processing workshop, recounted at the meeting the tragic experience of his family being destroyed by the Japanese invaders during their invasion of China, and said indignantly, "We persisted in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan before we defeated Japanese imperialism. Today, U.S. imperialism wants to revive Japanese militarism, and we will never agree to it. We will resolutely support the just struggle of the Japanese people until they achieve complete victory." Ji Zhanquan, a worker in the flowmeter workshop, said: "Now the people of the whole world are awakened, and the era in which U.S. imperialism arbitrarily manipulated all occupied countries and colonial peoples is over. If U.S. imperialism dares to impose war on the people, then the people of the whole world will unite and wipe it out completely." Feng Guangyi, a veteran of the Korean War and a worker in the electronics and electrical workshop, said at the meeting that U.S. imperialism was badly beaten in Korea. Today, it still doesn't know how to repent. If it insists on arming Japan to launch a new war, we will resolutely eliminate it, just like we did in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.
    Today, workers from the Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory, upon hearing that the Instrument Factory was holding a rally to support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the United States, also sent representatives to participate. Fu Yaowen, a worker in the assembly workshop of the factory, expressed at the meeting the firm opposition of the 120 workers in their workshop to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. He also said that the recent shooting down of a U.S. imperialist spy plane by the Soviet Union once again tells us that we must not have any illusions about imperialism and must persist in the struggle.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 17th. More than 1,500 members of the Xinglong Street People's Commune in Qixinggang, Chongqing, have held rallies, forums, and demonstrations in recent days to resolutely support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.
    Around 1939, Xinglong Street in Chongqing was barbarously bombed by Japanese planes. The entire street was destroyed, and more than 1,000 families were destroyed. Now, this residential area has established a people's commune, built factories and new residences, and the members are living a happy life. After hearing the news that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries were conspiring to plan a new war, they were particularly indignant. Many members who had personally suffered at the hands of the Japanese imperialists condemned their crimes at the meeting and expressed their determination to turn their anger into strength and resolutely support the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle. Peng Junhua, a member of the commune whose house was destroyed several times by Japanese planes during the War of Resistance Against Japan, said indignantly: "Once, due to the barbaric bombing by Japanese planes, our Xinglong Street burned for three days and three nights, and innocent people were burned to death everywhere. We still have vivid memories of this inhuman crime. Today, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have colluded to engage in a military alliance, attempting to destroy the people's happy life again. We will never allow it. If the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries dare to provoke a war, we will resolutely eliminate them." Huang Yanli, a worker at the Xinglong Street Hardware Factory, said: "The Japanese invaders occupied my hometown. I escaped from my hometown and begged all the way to Chongqing, only to be bombed by Japanese planes." He said, "I hate imperialism to the core. I resolutely oppose the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy to plan a new war and resolutely support the Japanese people's just struggle."

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 17th. Farmers in the Liutiao Lake area of Shenyang, who are busily engaged in agricultural work, recently used their rest time to hold a rally in Liutiaogou, the site where the "September 18th Incident" broke out, to strongly oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and express their full support for the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle.
    Twenty-nine years ago, on September 18th, Japanese militarism blew up the "Liutiaogou Bridge" on the South Manchurian Railway, creating an excuse to fire the first shot of aggression against China at Beidaying, and then invaded Shenyang and most of China. The people of the Liutiaohu Production Team of the Beiling People's Commune in Shenyang are witnesses to the shameless and barbaric acts of Japanese militarism, and they were the first to be trampled under the iron heels of the Japanese invaders. When they heard that Japanese militarism was making a comeback, it aroused their deep-seated hatred even more. Han Zhongfu, a sixty-two-year-old farmer, told everyone he met: "Japanese imperialism harmed us for fourteen years, and U.S. imperialism wants to revive Japanese militarism. We will never agree to it." People who had been captured as laborers, conscripted as soldiers, or imprisoned by Japanese fascist bandits in the past, and the families of victims, gathered with rakes and hoes in front of a model of a bomb made of cement by Japanese militarism. This "bomb" is now stuck upside down on a small hill near the railway. The enemy originally engraved the words "Site of War Outbreak" on it to commemorate their "military exploits." The farmers of Liutiao Lake had long erased it and wrote in vermilion ink the seven characters "Aggressors Will Be Destroyed." Now, the people participating in the rally filled it with slogans such as "Oppose the Revival of Japanese Militarism!" and "Support the Japanese People's Struggle Against the U.S.-Japan Military Treaty!"
    At a rally, Tian Yongnian, the eighteen-year-old livestock captain during the "September 18th Incident," climbed onto the base of the "bomb" and said with great indignation: "The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries still want to dream the old dream of invading China. That's simply wishful thinking. Today's Liutiao Lake is no longer the Liutiao Lake of the past, and today's China is no longer the China of the past. If they dare to launch a war, we have the power to wipe them out completely. The awakened Japanese people will certainly not allow Nobusuke Kishi to throw them into a new war again." Zheng Shunxiang, the secretary of the production team's party branch, warned the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries that the "bomb" used by the Japanese fascists to commemorate their "military exploits" had made a powerful demonstration that "aggressors will be destroyed." He said that we will stand with the Japanese people and fight to the end to completely shatter the aggressive ambitions of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

    1939年前后，重庆兴隆街遭到日寇飞机的野蛮轰炸，整个街道被炸毁，有一千多户居民家破人亡。现在，这个居民区成立了人民公社，建立了工厂和新的住宅，社员们都过着美满幸福的生活。他们在听到美日反动派又在阴谋策划新战争的消息以后，都特别愤慨，许多亲身受过害的社员在集会上控诉了日本法西斯强盗的罪行，并表示要化愤怒为力量，坚决支持日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争。在抗日战争期间几次遭到日寇飞机炸毁住宅的社员彭俊华愤慨地说：有一次由于日寇飞机的野蛮轰炸，使我们兴隆街一连燃烧三天三夜，被无辜烧死的人到处都是，这种惨无人道的罪行，直到现在我们还记忆犹新。今天美日反动派又勾结起来搞军事同盟，企图再来破坏人民的幸福生活，我们决不允许。如果美日反动派胆敢挑起战争，我们就坚决消灭它们。兴隆街小五金厂工人黄延礼说：“日寇侵占了我的家乡，我从家乡逃出，一路上讨饭逃到重庆，结果又遭到日寇飞机轰炸。”他说，我恨透了帝国主义，我坚决反对美日反动派策划新战争的阴谋，坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争。
    新华社沈阳17日电　正在紧张进行农事劳动的沈阳柳条湖一带农民，最近利用休息时间在“九一八”事件爆发地——柳条沟举行集会，强烈反对日美军事同盟条约，表示全力支援日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争。
    二十九年前的9月18日，日本军国主义在这里炸毁了南满铁路“柳条沟桥”，制造借口向北大营打响了侵略中国的第一发炮弹，进而侵入沈阳和大半个中国。沈阳北陵人民公社柳条湖生产队的人们，是日本军国主义无耻野蛮行为的见证人，他们首先遭到了日寇的铁蹄践踏。当他们听说日本军国主义又在死灰复燃，这更激起了他们的深仇旧恨。六十二岁的老农民韩忠富，逢人便说：“日本帝国主义祸害了我们十四年，美帝国主义还要把日本军国主义还阳，我们坚决不答应。”过去被日本法西斯强盗抓过劳工、抽过壮丁、关过牢的人，和被害者的家属，他们拿着耙子、镐头，纷纷到由日本军国主义用水泥修造的一颗炸弹模型跟前集会。这颗“炸弹”现在倒插在靠近铁路的小山丘上，敌人原来在上边刻着“战争爆发地”的字样，纪念他们的“战功”。柳条湖的农民早把它抹掉了，用米红颜色写上了“侵略者必取灭亡”七个大字。现在，参加集会的人们又在上面贴满了“反对复活日本军国主义！”“支援日本人民反对日美军事条约的斗争！”等标语。
    在一次集会上，“九一八”事变时年仅十八岁的牧畜队长田永稔，登上“炸弹”的底盘，万分愤慨地说：“美日反动派还想做侵略中国的老梦，那简直是异想天开，现在的柳条湖已不是当年的柳条湖，现在的中国已不是当年的中国了。如果它敢于发动战争，我们就有力量把它消灭得干干净净。觉悟了的日本人民，也一定不答应岸信介把他们再投入新的战争。”生产队党支部书记郑顺祥警告美日反动派说，当年日本法西斯纪念
  “战功”的“炸弹”已作出有力证明，“侵略者必取灭亡”。他说，我们一定和日本人民站在一起，为彻底粉碎日美反动派的侵略野心和日美军事同盟条约而斗争到底。
