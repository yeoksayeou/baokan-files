Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 29th May: Good news is pouring in from the Guangxi transportation front. As of May 20th, the region's highway and waterway freight volume had exceeded the target by 3%, completing the state's plan for the first half of the year forty-one days ahead of schedule, powerfully promoting the high-speed development of production.

Since the beginning of this year, under the guidance of the idea that "production is the center, and transportation is the key," transportation departments at all levels in the Autonomous Region have mobilized the superior forces of the transportation front to guarantee the transportation of key state materials. Since entering May, the region has further strengthened the organization and leadership of transportation, and leading comrades from transportation departments at all levels have rushed to the front line of production. In order to achieve rapid transportation by vehicles and ships, transportation departments have launched a upsurge of technological innovation and technological revolution centered on "four modernizations," vigorously engaging in the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading, unloading, and handling, reducing the time vehicles and ships stay in stations and ports. The main stations and concentration points of the Yulin and Wuzhou Prefectural Transportation Bureaus have built a large number of loading and unloading machines such as high platforms, low cargo spaces, and chutes, and sent special personnel to be responsible for directing loading and unloading, and promoted the advanced experience of loading after moving and unloading before moving, so that most vehicles can achieve the high efficiency of loading and unloading "one ton of cargo in no more than one minute." More than 3,000 employees of the Liuzhou Shipping Bureau worked hard for twenty days to build eight mechanized and semi-mechanized loading and unloading lines in Liuzhou Port, increasing the daily loading and unloading volume of the port by 3.8 times compared with the original, basically achieving "large ships no more than a day, small ships no more than half a day" for ships arriving at the port.

The "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration in transportation across the region has also made great progress since May. For example, Pingnan County organized a large-scale collaboration of production, supply, transportation, and sales, forming nine "dragon" transportation networks that combine long-distance transportation with short-distance transportation, modern transportation tools with folk transportation tools, channel transportation with river transportation, and implements "four unifications" (namely, unified planning, unified management, unified dispatch, and unified competition indicators), organically linking all transportation links, and transporting more than 40,000 tons of materials accumulated at Pingnan Port in twenty days.

    广西交通战线喜传捷报
    上半年公路和航运货运计划提前完成
    据新华社南宁29日电　广西交通运输战线喜传捷报。到5月20日止，全区公路、航运货运量已超额3％，提前四十一天完成了国家上半年的计划，有力地促进了生产高速度发展。
    今年以来，自治区各级交通运输部门在“生产是中心，运输是关键”的思想指导下，调动运输战线的优势兵力，保证国家重点物资运输。进入5月份以来，全区更进一步加强了交通运输的组织领导，各级交通运输部门的领导同志都奔赴生产第一线。为了使车船达到快速运输，交通运输部门掀起了以“四化”为中心内容的技术革新和技术革命运动的热潮，大搞装卸、搬运的机械化、半机械化，压缩车船在站港的停留时间。玉林、梧州专署交通局的主要车站和集运点，大量修建高站台、低货位、滑槽等装卸机具，并派出专人负责指挥装卸，推广先搬后装，先卸后搬的先进经验，使绝大部分的车辆做到装卸“吨（一吨货物）不过分（一分钟）”的高效率。柳州航运局三千多名职工突击二十天，在柳州港修建起八条机械化和半机械化的装卸线，使港口日装卸量比原来提高三点八倍，基本实现到港船舶“大船不过天，小船不过晌午”。
    全区运输“一条龙”大协作在5月以来也有很大发展。如平南县组织产、供、运、销大协作，把长途运输与短途运输、现代化运输工具与民间运输工具、渠道运输与江河运输等组成九条“龙”的运输网，实行“四统一”（即统一计划、统一管理、统一调度、统一竞赛指标），把各个运输环节有机地联系起来，二十天中就把平南港口码头积压待运的四万多吨物资运了出去。
