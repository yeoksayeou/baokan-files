Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch from Salisbury: After being violently suppressed by the British colonial authorities last weekend, Africans in the Northern Rhodesian copper mining area rose up again on the 12th to oppose British colonial rule. In Ndola, Africans attacked colonialists with stones.

Last weekend, after the police suppressed a rally held by the United National Independence Party of Northern Rhodesia and arrested a large number of Africans, angry Africans in the copper mining area attacked British colonialists. Subsequently, the United National Independence Party of Northern Rhodesia called for a week-long boycott of all colonialist-run mines and beer halls. In a panic, the British colonial authorities stepped up the deployment of police to guard various parts of the copper mining area, mobilized police reserves, and on the 11th, banned the United National Independence Party of Northern Rhodesia in the Western Province (including the copper mining area). The colonial authorities also issued a special public announcement in Lusaka, announcing that Africans could be arrested and detained without a warrant.

    殖民当局慌忙调派警察阴谋进行镇压
    新华社13日讯　索耳兹伯里消息：上周末遭到英国殖民当局暴力镇压的北罗得西亚铜矿地带的非洲人12日再次群起反对英国殖民统治。在恩多拉，非洲人用石头袭击了殖民主义者。
    上周末，在警察镇压了北罗得西亚联合民族独立党所召开的一个集会和大批逮捕非洲人以后，这个铜矿地带的愤怒的非洲人就曾经袭击了英国殖民者。随后，北罗得西亚联合民族独立党号召对所有殖民主义者经营的矿井和啤酒店进行为时一周的抵制。在惊惶失措之下，英国殖民当局加紧派警察在铜矿地带各地戒备，动员警察后备队，11日又宣布在西方省（包括铜矿地带在内）取缔北罗得西亚联合民族独立党。殖民当局还在卢萨卡发表一项特别公报，宣布可以不带拘捕令逮捕、拘留非洲人。
