Using Various Weed Stems and Bark as Substitutes for Wood
Tang County Uses Indigenous Methods to Mass Produce Fiberboard

(Reported by this newspaper) Tang County, Hebei Province, has launched a mass movement to produce fiberboard using indigenous methods. In less than two months, all ten people's communes in the county have established fiberboard factories using local methods. They can produce more than 1,000 pieces of fiberboard, two feet wide, four feet long, and half a centimeter thick, every day. The quality of the fiberboard has been assessed by relevant departments and basically meets the requirements. In addition, a county-run factory with an annual output of 150 tons of fiberboard has also been established.

The people's communes in Tang County have already produced more than 20,000 pieces of fiberboard, which not only promptly supplied the county's need for timber but also supported Baoding, Tianjin, and other cities with materials. At the current production capacity, the county can produce about 2,000 tons of fiberboard this year, which can replace more than 11,000 cubic meters of logs.

The biggest characteristic of Tang County's development of fiberboard production is the use of indigenous methods and factories run by every commune. The production equipment of the fiberboard factory is simple. A large pot, a stone roller, a few small steel plates, and a 7 to 15 horsepower boiler are the main production equipment of an indigenous fiberboard factory. The source of raw materials is abundant. Wheat straw, reeds, cotton stalks, mountain grass, branches, twigs, bark, etc., can be found everywhere.

Tang County is located in the central Hebei plain, which is a timber-deficient area. Since the Great Leap Forward, especially after the people's communes were established, various economic construction undertakings have developed rapidly, and the demand for timber has increased sharply. In 1959, the gap between the county's timber needs and its possible supply was about 50%, and this year it is about 70%. In response to this situation, the Tang County Party Committee proposed the slogan of "the whole party and the whole people engaging in the large-scale production of artificial boards, vowing not to rest until complete victory is won," and launched a mass movement to produce fiberboard on a large scale throughout the county. However, there were two different views on how to do it: one group advocated running large-scale, foreign-style factories, believing that to do it well, they had to ask the higher authorities for machines and equipment. They believed that fiberboard could not be produced without a hot press. The other group advocated the complete opposite. They believed that it was necessary to adopt indigenous methods first, then foreign methods, relying on their own efforts to build fiberboard factories on a large scale. Based on these two opinions, the County Party Committee promptly organized the masses to air their views and debate, criticized the former idea of ​​greed for bigness and foreign things and reaching out to higher authorities, and encouraged and supported the latter idea of ​​looking downward and using indigenous methods. In order to solve the technical problems, they exerted their utmost efforts to study on their own. Leading cadres led skilled craftsmen to visit the Guanghua Wood Factory in Beijing and the Baoding Timber Management Department to learn about the foreign method of producing fiberboard, study manufacturing processes, and after returning, organized relevant personnel to hold a "Zhuge Liang Meeting." Referring to the experiences of other places, after repeated research and experimentation, they finally created a set of methods for manufacturing fiberboard using indigenous methods, and established a demonstration fiberboard factory in the county seat. Then, the County Party Committee organized the Party Committee secretaries and skilled craftsmen of various communes and factories to visit the site and introduced the experience and technology to them. All ten communes in the county quickly established fiberboard factories.

At present, the fiberboard factories of the people's communes throughout the county are carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution on a large scale. Wangdu People's Commune has changed manual pulping to boiler-driven pulping. The fiberboard factory of Wangjing People's Commune has connected all the processes of the entire production into a continuous production process.

Fiberboard is a type of artificial board. It is made of plant fiber that has been crushed, pressed, and heated. It has a wide range of uses and high economic value and can be used instead of wooden boards. Developing fiberboard production using Tang County's method has the advantages of fast factory construction, low investment, less manpower, quick results, rapid popularization, and easy operation. The Ministry of Forestry recently held an on-site meeting in Tang County to promote the experience of Tang County to various places. (Attached picture)

### 利用各种杂草秆皮代替木材  唐县用土办法大造纤维板

    利用各种杂草秆皮代替木材
    唐县用土办法大造纤维板
    本报讯　河北省唐县各人民公社土法上马，大搞纤维板生产，在不到两个月的时间里，全县十个人民公社都建立了土法生产纤维板厂，每天可生产二尺宽、四尺长、半公分厚的纤维板一千多块，纤维板的质量经过有关部门鉴定基本合乎要求。此外还办了一座年产一百五十吨纤维板的县营工厂。
    唐县各人民公社目前已经生产出纤维板两万多块，不仅及时供应了本县所需板材，而且还支援了保定、天津等市用材。按现在的生产能力今年全县可生产纤维板二千吨左右，可代替原木一万一千多立米。
    唐县发展纤维板生产最大的特点是土法上马，社社办厂。纤维板厂生产设备简单，大锅、石碾、几块小钢板和一台七至十五马力的锅驼机就是一个土法纤维板厂的主要生产设备。原料来源丰富，所用的麦秸、芦苇、棉花秆、山草、树枝、树杈、树皮等到处皆有。
    唐县位于冀中平原，是一个缺木材的地区。大跃进以来，特别是人民公社化后，各项经济建设事业迅速发展，木材需要量急剧增长，1959年全县需要的木材和可能提供量之间相差50％左右，今年则差70％左右。唐县县委针对这种情况，提出全党全民大搞人造板，不获全胜誓不休的号召，在全县掀起了一个群众性大搞纤维板生产的运动。可是，用什么办法搞，却有两种不同的主张：一种人主张是办大的、办洋的，要搞就得向上级要机器、要设备。他们认为：没有热压机不能生产纤维板。另一种人主张与此完全相反。他们认为：必须采取土法上马，先土后洋，自力更生，大搞纤维板厂。县委根据这两种意见，及时地组织群众鸣放辩论，批判了前一种贪大图洋，向上伸手的思想，鼓励和支持了后一种眼睛向下，土法上马的主张。为了解决技术问题，他们鼓足干劲自己钻研。并由领导干部带领能工巧匠先后到北京光华木材厂、保定木材经理部参观洋法生产纤维板，学习制造工艺，回去后，组织有关人员举行“诸葛亮会”，参照外地的经验，经过反复的研究试验终于创造出了一套用土法制造纤维板的办法，在县城办起了示范性的纤维板工厂。接着，县委组织各公社、工厂的党委书记、能工巧匠到现场参观，把经验和技术介绍给他们。全县十个公社很快都建立了纤维板厂。
    目前，全县各人民公社的纤维板厂正在大搞技术革新和技术革命。望都人民公社，已将人工打浆改变为锅驼机带动打浆。王京人民公社的纤维板厂已将整个生产的各个工序连在一起，组成了一个连续化生产过程。
    纤维板是人造板中的一种，它是用植物纤维经过粉碎、加压、加热做成的，用途很广，经济价值很高，可以代替木板使用。用唐县的办法发展纤维板生产，具有建厂快、投资少、用人少、收效快、普及快、操作方便的优点。林业部最近在唐县召开现场会议，向各地推广了唐县的经验。（附图片）
