Xinhua News Agency, May 27th, New York dispatch: The United Nations Security Council concluded its discussion on the issue of the Soviet government's proposal "regarding the aggressive actions of U.S. military aircraft against the Soviet Union that threaten universal peace" on the morning of May 26th.

Under the control of the majority of representatives from Western countries such as the United States, Britain, and France, the meeting rejected the draft resolution submitted by the Soviet representative demanding condemnation and cessation of U.S. espionage and aggressive activities. Representatives from the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Poland voted in favor of the Soviet draft resolution. Representatives from Ceylon and Tunisia abstained. Representatives from the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Ecuador, and the so-called representative of the Chiang Kai-shek clique voted against it.

Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko spoke at the morning meeting. He pointed out that the position of the U.S. representative and those who supported the U.S. representative at the Security Council meeting, attempting to defend the U.S.'s provocative policy toward the Soviet Union, is untenable. The U.S. government insists that a single-engine, unarmed aircraft with only a pilot flying over the Soviet border does not constitute an act of aggression. This argument is strange and absurd.

Gromyko said that those who insist that an aircraft violating another country's border does not constitute aggression also evade the fact that U.S. aircraft have violated the Soviet border more than once.

Gromyko mentioned Eisenhower's so-called statement that he had ordered U.S. aircraft to stop violating the Soviet border. He pointed out that Eisenhower had said at the preparatory meeting of the four-power government heads that his guarantee was only valid during his term in the White House, that is, before January 1961. However, the U.S. President did not tell American public opinion about this reservation in his radio address on the 25th. Furthermore, he categorically stated that the U.S. government would continue to use all old and new means to conduct reconnaissance and espionage activities against the Soviet Union.

Gromyko said that the speech by the head of the U.S. government only illustrates that he himself and the government he leads will not abandon the aggressive policy toward the Soviet Union and will not condemn this policy.

Gromyko said: The U.S. government can decide whether to send aircraft to invade Soviet airspace or not. However, not everything depends on the United States. In many respects, it will depend on the Soviet Union, which will destroy these aircraft and give the aggressors the punishment they deserve.

Since the U.S. government's note and Eisenhower's statement confirm that provocative actions against the Soviet Union will remain U.S. national policy, then, the Soviet Foreign Minister said, the U.S. government should know that it will bear full responsibility for continuing to pursue this policy.

Gromyko condemned the attempt to divert attention from U.S. espionage and aggressive activities with a pile of so-called lies about Soviet espionage activities in the United States as clumsy.

Gromyko also pointed out that the U.S. government and Eisenhower himself attempted to conceal U.S. aggressive actions with the U.S.'s "responsibilities to other countries." Gromyko said that the Soviet government has stated in response to this attempt by the U.S. government, and now reiterates, that the Soviet Union will give the aggressors who dare to invade the borders of the Soviet state again, and their accomplices, the punishment they deserve, regardless of whether they are voluntarily or involuntarily colluding with the aggressors.

Gromyko condemned the speeches of the British and French representatives as stemming from concerns about the joint protection of members of the North Atlantic military bloc.

Gromyko also said that those who defend the aggressors in the Security Council should know that appeasing the aggressors is to encourage them to carry out more dangerous provocations.

U.S. representative Lodge, in his speech, on the one hand, shamelessly defended the U.S.'s crimes of aggression again, and on the other hand, attempted to portray the U.S. as an innocent lamb.

Xinhua News Agency, May 27th, TASS dispatch from New York on the 27th: The United Nations Security Council yesterday afternoon moved on to discuss the "Four-Power Proposal" of Argentina, Tunisia, Ceylon, and Ecuador. This proposal suggests that the four major governments should strive to resolve existing international problems through negotiations and calls on all member governments of the United Nations to abandon any actions that might exacerbate tensions. It is worth noting that although the "Four-Power Proposal" was put forward after discussing the Soviet Union's proposal to the Security Council regarding the aggressive actions of U.S. military aircraft against the Soviet Union that endanger the cause of peace, it does not mention such actions at all, nor does it mention the necessity of stopping such dangerous provocative actions by the United States.

The "Four-Power Proposal" received enthusiastic support from the U.S. representative and the representatives of the U.S.'s European allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko pointed out in his speech that the main issue attracting worldwide attention now is the U.S.'s provocative actions against the Soviet Union, and the "Four-Power Proposal" ignores this issue. The Soviet representative said that the "Four-Power Proposal" does not even address the issue of condemning provocative policies.

Gromyko said, we must speak frankly and openly: the prescription submitted to the Security Council is a bad medicine. Experience shows that there has never been an instance in history where concessions to aggressors have helped eliminate the danger of aggression. On the contrary, such concessions inevitably arouse their greed.

Gromyko pointed out that U.S. President Eisenhower, in his speech delivered on behalf of the United States to the world on May 25th, announced a broad plan for espionage and sabotage activities against the Soviet Union, as well as a plan to continue dangerous provocative activities against our country. Gromyko asked, can this statement indicate that the United States is willing to seek ways to improve relations with the Soviet Union, is willing to promote the easing of international tensions, and is willing to hold serious negotiations on outstanding issues? In this statement, the imperialist aims of U.S. foreign policy to intensify international tensions are clearly demonstrated. This is particularly evident in such a demonstrative statement to the world: the U.S. government intends to continue to pursue a military espionage and sabotage policy against the Soviet Union in the future, which is a dangerous provocative policy that actually brings mankind to the brink of war.

The Soviet representative went on to say that many representatives in the Security Council today raised their hands against the Soviet Union's proposal to condemn the aggressors, which is also raising their hands against peace, against easing international tensions, advocating inciting hatred between countries, and advocating continuing the "Cold War" so favored by American imperialists.

Speaking about the intention mentioned in the "Four-Power Proposal" to promote negotiations between major powers, Gromyko emphasized that the Soviet government is not opposed to negotiations between major powers, and it is best to appeal to those who disrupt negotiations and make such negotiations impossible. However, we do not believe that those who have just disrupted such a meeting will not carry out new provocations again and will not attempt to disrupt the summit meeting before it even begins.

The Soviet representative said that the Security Council should justly say that it believes that the intrusion of foreign military aircraft into the airspace of other countries is a violation of the inviolable principles of sovereignty, which is contrary to the basic principles and purposes of the United Nations and is a threat to peace.

The Soviet Foreign Minister submitted amendments to the "Four-Power Proposal." The Security Council will continue to discuss the "Four-Power Proposal."

    葛罗米柯在联合国安理会上发言
    斥责美国政府坚持对苏联的侵略
    会议在美英法把持下否决了苏联决议草案开始讨论为美国开脱的四国提案
    据新华社27日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会5月26日上午结束了就苏联政府提出的“关于美国军用飞机对苏联进行了对普遍和平造成威胁的侵略行动”的问题的讨论。
    会议在美、英、法等西方国家多数代表把持的情况下，否决了苏联代表提出的要求谴责和停止美国的间谍侵略活动的决议草案。投票赞成苏联决议草案的有苏联和波兰人民共和国的代表。锡兰和突尼斯代表弃权。美国、英国、法国、意大利、厄瓜多尔和蒋介石分子的所谓代表投票反对。
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在上午会议上发了言。他指出，美国代表和那些在安理会会议上支持美国代表的人企图为美国对苏联的挑衅政策辩护的立场是站不住脚的。美国政府硬说，一架没有武装的、单引擎的、载有一个飞行员的飞机飞临苏联国境根本不是侵略行为。这种论调是奇怪而荒谬的。
    葛罗米柯说，那些硬说一架飞机侵犯别国国境不算侵略的人还回避这样一个事实：美国飞机对苏联国境的侵犯发生过不止一次。
    葛罗米柯提到艾森豪威尔的所谓已经下令美国飞机停止侵犯苏联国境的声明，他指出，艾森豪威尔在四国政府首脑会议预备会议上说过，他的保证只是在他留任白宫期间，即在1961年1月以前有效，而美国总统在25日的广播演说中没有把这个保留条件告诉美国的社会舆论。不仅如此，他断然地说，美国政府将继续采用一切旧的和新的手段对苏联进行侦察活动和间谍活动。
    葛罗米柯说，美国政府首脑的演说只是说明了这样一点，即：他本人和他所领导的政府将不放弃对苏联的侵略方针，将不指责这种政策。
    葛罗米柯说：美国政府可以决定派遣或是不派遣飞机侵入苏联领空。但是，不是一切都取决于美国。许多方面将取决于苏联，苏联将消灭这些飞机，并给侵略者以应有的回击。
    既然美国政府的照会和艾森豪威尔的声明确认，对苏联采取挑衅行动仍然将是美国的国策，那么，苏联外长说，美国政府应当知道，它将对继续奉行这种政策承担全部的责任。
    葛罗米柯斥责用一大堆所谓苏联在美国进行间谍活动的谎言来转移对美国间谍侵略活动的注意力的企图是笨拙的。
    葛罗米柯还指出，美国政府和艾森豪威尔本人企图用美国“对别国所负的责任”来掩饰美国的侵略行动。葛罗米柯说，苏联政府在回答美国政府的这种企图时曾经声明过，现在再次声明，苏联将给予胆敢再次进犯苏维埃国家国境的侵略者，以及他们的帮凶以应有的打击，不管他们是自愿地或不自愿地同侵略者合伙。
    葛罗米柯谴责英国和法国代表的发言出于对北大西洋军事集团参加国的连环保的考虑。
    葛罗米柯还说，那些在安理会上为侵略者辩护的应当知道，姑息侵略者，就是鼓励他们进行更危险的挑衅。
    美国代表洛奇在发言中一方面再次为美国的侵略罪行进行无耻的狡辩，同时又企图把美国说成是一只无辜的羔羊。
    据新华社27日讯　据塔斯社纽约27日讯：联合国安全理事会昨天下午会议转入讨论阿根廷、突尼斯、锡兰和厄瓜多尔“四国提案”。这个提案是建议四大国政府努力通过谈判途径解决现存的国际问题，并呼吁联合国所有会员国政府放弃一切可能加剧紧张局势的行动。值得注意的是，虽然“四国提案”是在讨论苏联向安理会提出的关于美国军用飞机对苏联进行了危及和平事业的侵略行动问题以后提出的，但是，其中只字未提到这种行动，只字未提制止美国这种危险的挑衅行动的必要性。
    “四国提案”受到美国代表和美国的北大西洋公约组织欧洲盟国代表的热烈支持。
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯发言指出，现在吸引全世界注意的主要问题是美国对苏联的挑衅行动问题，而“四国提案”忽略了这个问题。苏联代表说，“四国提案”甚至没有涉及到谴责挑衅政策的问题。
    葛罗米柯说，我们必须坦率而开诚布公地说：向安理会提出的药方是一剂坏药。经验表明，历史上从未有过对侵略者的让步有助于消除侵略的危险的事例。相反地，这种让步必然引起它的贪欲。
    葛罗米柯指出，美国总统艾森豪威尔5月25日代表美国向全世界发表的演说中，宣布了一项对苏联进行间谍破坏活动的广泛计划，以及一项对我国继续进行危险的挑衅活动的计划。葛罗米柯问道，难道这种声明能够说明美国愿意寻求同苏联改善关系的途径，愿意促进国际紧张局势的缓和以及就悬而未决的问题举行认真的谈判吗？在这项声明里，十分明显地表现了美国外交政策加剧国际紧张局势的帝国主义目的。这一点特别表现在这样一种对全世界示威性的声明中：美国政府打算今后继续对苏联奉行军事间谍和破坏政策，这是一种实际上使人类濒临战争边缘的危险的挑衅政策。
    苏联代表接着说，安理会许多代表今天举手反对苏联谴责侵略者的建议，这也就是举手反对和平、反对缓和国际紧张局势，主张在国与国之间挑起仇恨，主张继续美国帝国主义者十分宠爱的“冷战”。
    葛罗米柯在谈到“四国提案”中所说的必须促进大国之间的谈判的意图时着重指出，苏联政府不反对大国之间的谈判，最好是向那些破坏谈判、使这种谈判成为不可能的人发出呼吁。但是，我们不相信，那些刚刚破坏了这种会议的人不会再进行新的挑衅和不再企图在会议开始以前就破坏最高级会议。
    苏联代表说，安全理事会应该公正地说，它认为，外国军用飞机侵入别国领空是对主权的不可动摇的原则的破坏，这是与联合国的基本原则和宗旨背道而驰的，是对和平的威胁。
    苏联外交部长提出了对“四国提案”的修正案。安全理事会将继续讨论“四国提案”。
