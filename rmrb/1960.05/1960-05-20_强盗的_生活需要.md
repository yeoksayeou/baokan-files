    The Robber's "Needs of Life"
    Dīng Shān

    The Soviet poet Watsujeikis, in condemning the shameless crimes of American imperialism, said: "America's behavior is like a robber standing before a judge. The robber pats his chest and says, I robbed in the past, and I will rob in the future! Because this is my need for life." These few words vividly and profoundly portray the true face of the American aggressors and expose the nature of the aggressors.

    After being strongly condemned by the Soviet government, the head of U.S. imperialism, Eisenhower, still clamored to pursue his aggressive policy, and another advocate of the war policy, Nixon, even went so far as to defy the world and frantically clamored to persist in aggressive misdeeds and continue to be enemies with the people of the world. On May 15, Nixon brazenly ran to the television station, patted his chest and openly said that as long as the Soviet Union continues to implement its policy of secrecy, the United States has reason to take measures such as sending U-2 aircraft to invade Soviet airspace to collect intelligence. Nixon confessed that not only did Eisenhower fully know about the criminal activities of the spy planes, but he also "knew the inside story" and "approved of this matter." He also said that the US spy plane activities have been going on for four years, and this reconnaissance intelligence flight has provided the United States with "essential" intelligence, including hundreds of thousands of photos. Nixon, in the face of the just trial of the Soviet Union and the people of the world, and under the denunciation of fair public opinion in various countries, showed his ferocious features and issued such shameless cries. What a hateful and detestable robber's face this is.

    Nixon's clamor vividly exposed the true face of the U.S. imperialists' consistent pursuit of war and aggression policies, and aroused the boundless anger of the people of the world even more. The captured robber used "the Soviet Union continues to implement its policy of secrecy" as an excuse to try his best to defend the crimes he committed, and even used this as a "reason" to continue aggressive activities. This is naturally an absurd robber logic. According to Nixon, U.S. imperialism is rampant and does whatever it wants in the world, and it is "justified" in wantonly invading the people of various countries. However, isn't this precisely the war policy that the U.S. imperialists are trying their best to conceal? Isn't this exactly the American presidents tearing off their masks of peace-loving themselves? Nixon revealed in one sentence that the activities of American spy planes have lasted for four years, and the intelligence photos taken have amounted to hundreds of thousands. Doesn't this more clearly tell people that U.S. imperialism has consistently pursued a policy of aggression and deliberately undermined peace, and that the so-called "peace-loving" and other flowery words are just deceptive tricks? From the new teaching material provided by Nixon, a negative teacher, the people of the world will see more clearly how U.S. imperialism has consistently and stubbornly prepared for a war of aggression.

    The nature of robbers is hard to change. However, the people of the world are fully capable of making a just trial and severe sanctions against the robbers. Chairman Mao said: "If the American monopoly capitalist groups insist on pursuing their policies of aggression and war, they will inevitably be sentenced to hanging by the people of the world one day." That day is coming.

    强盗的“生活需要”
    丁山
    苏联诗人瓦茨耶基斯在谴责美帝国主义的无耻罪行时说：“美国的行为正像是一个站在法官面前的强盗。强盗拍着胸脯说，我过去抢劫，以后还要抢劫！因为这是我的生活需要。”这几句话形象而深刻地画出了美国侵略者的真面目，揭破了侵略者的本性。
    美帝国主义的首脑艾森豪威尔在受到苏联政府的强烈谴责以后，仍然扬言要奉行他的侵略政策，而另一个战争政策的鼓吹者尼克松更是冒天下之大不韪，疯狂叫嚣坚持侵略恶行，继续与世界人民为敌。5月15日，尼克松厚颜无耻地跑到电视台上去，拍着胸脯公开说，只要苏联继续执行保密政策，美国就有理由采取像派U—2型飞机侵入苏联领空搜集情报那样的措施。尼克松招认，不仅艾森豪威尔完全知道间谍飞机的罪恶活动，而且他也“了解内情”“赞成这件事”。还说，美国的间谍飞机活动已经进行了四年，这种侦察情报的飞行已经为美国提供了“必不可少的”包括几十万张照片在内的情报。尼克松在苏联和世界人民正义的审判面前，在各国公正舆论的怒斥之下，竟然凶相毕露，发出这般无耻叫嚣，这是一副多么可恶而又可恨的强盗嘴脸。
    尼克松的叫嚷，活生生地暴露了美帝国主义者一贯推行战争政策和侵略政策的真正面目，更加激起世界人民的无比愤怒。被捉住了的强盗用“苏联继续执行保密政策”作借口，竭力为自己犯下的罪恶进行辩解，并且还以此当作继续进行侵略活动的“理由”，这自然是一种荒谬绝伦的强盗逻辑。照尼克松说来，美帝国主义在世界上横行霸道，为所欲为，对各国人民肆意进行侵略都是“有理由”的了。然而，这不正是美帝国主义者所竭力加以掩饰的战争政策吗？这不正是美国总统们把爱好和平的面具自己揭破了吗？尼克松一语道破，美国间谍飞机的活动已达四年之久，拍摄的情报照片竟至几十万张之多，这不就更加清楚地告诉人们，美帝国主义是一贯奉行侵略政策，蓄意破坏和平的，所谓“爱好和平”等等花言巧语不过是骗人的把戏而已。从尼克松这个反面教员提供的新教材里，世界人民会更清楚地看到美帝国主义是如何一贯地顽固不化地准备侵略战争的真面目。
    强盗的本性是难移的。但是，世界人民完全有力量对强盗们作出正义的审判和严厉的制裁。毛主席说：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。”这一天，就要到来了。
