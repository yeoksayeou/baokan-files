    Jiangbei People's Commune in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, since its establishment in August 1958, has focused on developing production, comprehensively organizing the people's economic and cultural life, and has now become a thriving industrial and productive street based on production.

    Since its establishment, the Commune Party Committee has firmly grasped the link of developing production, implemented the policy of moving from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and having commune-run industries serve large factories, serve industrial and agricultural production, and serve the needs of the people's lives. It has launched mass movements, mobilizing the masses to start industries in a big way by adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and relying on their own efforts. Before communization, there were only a few small assembly factories and workshops here. After communization, in just over a year, the district established 55 factories, including electric machinery factories, chemical factories, plastic products factories, coal briquette factories, light bulb factories, clothing factories, and textile factories, employing more than 2,500 workers, including five factories with more than 100 workers. Since these commune-run industries began production, production has been surging wave after wave. Last year, they comprehensively overfulfilled the production plan 76 days ahead of schedule, and the total industrial output value increased by more than eleven times compared with 1958. In the first quarter of this year, a greater development was achieved on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, with the total output value exceeding more than 39% of the total output value of the entire previous year, and the products increased from more than 130 kinds to more than 200 kinds.

    These commune-run industries were established by the commune members under the leadership of the Party, adapting to local conditions, using indigenous methods, and starting from scratch, and they have developed rapidly, growing from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, and becoming increasingly strong. The Jiangbei Electromechanical Plant, which now has more than 170 workers, had only simple tools such as a pair of pliers, two wrenches, and two bamboo and wood hand-cranked wire drawing machines when it was established in 1958. After more than a year, it now has 17 kinds of mechanical cutting equipment such as gear lathes, gantry planers, and backpack lathes. These equipment, in addition to those supported by large factories, were all manufactured by the workers themselves, arming themselves with their own strength. In the past, this factory could only produce screws, but now it can produce more than 70 kinds of products such as motors, compensators, bench drills, yarn-wrapped silk, and automatic drop-out fuse holders. The capital has expanded from scratch to more than 300,000 yuan. They also linked up with rural people's communes to help repair agricultural machinery such as water pumps. These commune-run factories not only solved the equipment problem with indigenous methods, but also obtained most of the raw materials locally, widely using the corners, edges, and scraps of large factories, turning the useless into useful, and turning one use into multiple uses. For example, the cotton and palm factory uses yarn scraps from yarn factories to make yarn ropes and canvas; uses old hemp and old palm to make various hemp ropes and palm ropes; and uses old cotton to make quilt batting and flower tubes. Last year alone, it used nearly 500,000 catties of waste materials such as old cotton and old palm, creating a large amount of wealth for society.

    Through the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the commune-run factories in Jiangbei People's Commune has been greatly improved. Many factories have changed their small and indigenous appearance, the scale of production has been expanding, and the level of production technology has also been continuously improved. In the past, many products that could not be produced can now be produced, and a variety of cutting-edge products can now be produced. With the rapid improvement of the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization and the level of technology, labor productivity has also been significantly improved, laying a relatively solid material foundation for the economic foundation of the entire commune.

### 土法上马，就地取材，变无用为有用，变一用为多用  江北公社自己武装自己

    土法上马，就地取材，变无用为有用，变一用为多用
    江北公社自己武装自己
    本报讯　浙江省宁波市江北人民公社，从1958年8月成立以来，以发展生产为中心，全面组织人民的经济生活和文化生活，现在已是社办工业欣欣向荣、生产蒸蒸日上，成为以生产为主的街道。
    公社党委在公社成立后，紧紧抓住发展生产这一环节，贯彻执行了由小到大、从土到洋、土洋并举和社办工业为大工厂服务、为工农业生产服务、为人民生活需要服务的方针，大搞群众运动，发动群众因地制宜、就地取材、自力更生大办工业。公社化前，这里只有几家装装配配的小工厂、小工场；公社化后仅一年多的时间，全区办起了电动机械厂、化工厂、塑料制品厂、煤球厂、灯泡厂、被服厂、纺织厂等五十五个工厂，职工达两千五百多人，其中一百人以上的工厂就有五个。这些社办工业，自开始投入生产以来，生产一浪高过一浪，去年提前七十六天全面超额完成了生产计划，工业总产值比1958年增长了十一倍多。今年第一季度又在去年大跃进的基础上获得更大的发展，总产值超过去年全年总产值的39％多，产品由一百三十多种，增加到二百多种。
    这些社办工业是社员们在党的领导下因地制宜、土法上马、白手起家办起来的，并且发展很快，由小到大、由土到洋，日益壮大。现在已有一百七十多个工人的江北机电厂，在1958年开办时只有一把老虎钳、二把板头、二台竹木结构的手摇拉丝车等简单的工具；经过一年多的时间，现在已拥有全齿轮车床、龙门刨床、背包车床等十七种机械切削设备。这些设备除了由大厂支援的以外，都是工人们自己制造出来的，以自己的力量武装了自己。这个厂过去只能生产螺丝，现在已能生产电动机、补偿器、台钻、纱包丝、自动跌落保险丝具等七十多种产品了。资金从无到有，已扩大到三十多万元。他们还和农村人民公社挂钩，帮助修理水泵等农业机械。这些社办工厂，不但用土办法解决了设备问题，而且原料也大都取于当地，广泛利用大工厂的角料、边料和下脚料，变无用为有用，变一用为多用。如棉棕厂利用纱厂下脚纱，制成纱绳、帆布；利用旧麻、旧棕制成各种麻绳、棕绳；利用旧棉花做成被花、花筒。去年一年，共利用旧棉、旧棕等废料近五十万斤，为社会创造了大笔财富。
    通过技术革新和技术革命运动，江北人民公社社办工厂的机械化、半机械化程度大大提高。许多工厂已改变了又小又土的面貌，生产规模日益扩大，生产技术水平也不断提高。过去许多不能生产的产品，现在能够生产了，而且已能生产多种尖端产品。随着机械化、半机械化程度和技术水平的迅速提高，劳动生产率也显著提高，为全社经济奠定了比较雄厚的物质基础。
