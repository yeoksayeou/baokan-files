Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, May 10th: Guinean President Sékou Touré, speaking at a gathering of senior Guinean government officials on the afternoon of May 9th, expressed a warm welcome for the support given by the Chinese government and people to the struggle of the peoples of African countries and the people of Guinea to win and safeguard national independence.

President Touré said that the Chinese government and people are the true friends of the peoples of African countries and the people of Guinea. When those imperialists were carrying out activities attempting to subvert independent Guinea, and when French colonialists were waging a heinous war aimed at eliminating the national movement of the Algerian people, the Chinese government and 650 million Chinese people declared: they stand with the peoples of African countries and the people of Guinea, and they fight shoulder to shoulder with us against imperialism and colonialism until final victory is achieved. He said that with the firm support of the 650 million Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world, our struggle against imperialism is strengthening. He said, I am deeply convinced that victory will surely belong to us.

In his speech, President Touré relayed Vice Premier He Long's speech on the evening of May 2nd at a banquet welcoming the delegation of the Provisional Government of Algeria, in which he expressed support for the Algerian people and the peoples of African countries. At that time, prolonged thunderous applause resounded throughout the venue.

    中国人民是非洲人民的真正朋友
    杜尔热烈欢迎中国人民对非洲独立斗争的支持
    新华社科纳克里10日电　几内亚总统塞古·杜尔9日下午在几内亚政府高级干部集会上讲话时，表示热烈欢迎中国政府和人民对非洲各国人民和几内亚人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争所给予的支持。
    杜尔总统说，中国政府和人民是非洲各国人民和几内亚人民的真正朋友。当那些帝国主义者进行企图颠复独立的几内亚的活动的时候，当法国殖民主义者进行旨在消灭阿尔及利亚人民的民族运动的罪恶战争的时候，中国政府和六亿五千万中国人民宣布：他们同非洲各国人民和几内亚人民站在一起，他们同我们肩并肩地对帝国主义和殖民主义战斗，直到获得最后的胜利。他说，在六亿五千万中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民对我们的坚定支持下，我们的反对帝国主义的斗争正在加强。他说，我深信，胜利一定属于我们。
    杜尔总统在讲话中转述了贺龙副总理5月2日晚间在欢迎阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团的宴会上对阿尔及利亚人民和非洲各国人民表示支持的讲话。当时，会场上响起了长久的春雷般的掌声。
