Xinhua News Agency, May 6th: General Luo Ruiqing, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, hosted a banquet tonight to welcome the military delegation from the Kingdom of Sweden, headed by Major General Ohlman.

At the beginning of the banquet, General Luo Ruiqing delivered a speech, saying that on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, he extended a warm welcome to the Swedish military delegation for their visit to China. He said that the Chinese people and the Swedish people both love peace. The representatives of the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden have contributed to the cause of safeguarding peace in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea.

General Luo Ruiqing said that the Chinese government has always adhered to the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and has consistently advocated the reasonable resolution of outstanding international issues through peaceful negotiation, and is willing to develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The Chinese people have consistently made unremitting efforts to ease international tensions.

General Luo Ruiqing said that the American ruling clique is vigorously supporting the militarist forces of Japan and West Germany, attempting to turn these two countries into dangerous sources of war once again. American imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan by force, and, disregarding the repeated warnings of the Chinese government, continues to violate our territorial waters and airspace, carrying out military provocations and threats of war. He said that the Chinese People's Volunteers had already taken the initiative to withdraw from Korea; however, the US military not only refuses to leave South Korea but also seriously violates the armistice agreement and repeatedly and illegally transports modern weapons, including missiles, into South Korea. All this cannot but arouse the vigilance of peace-loving countries and peoples. He said that today, the forces of peace far outweigh the forces of war. All aggressive activities and war conspiracies of imperialism will, as in the past, meet with shameful failure.

Major General Ohlman then spoke, saying that we are proud to be the first Swedish military delegation to visit China, and we also hope to further enhance the already established ties between the Swedish and Chinese armed forces. He said that both China and Sweden have repeatedly declared that their main desire in diplomacy is to ease international tensions and promote good friendly relations and world peace between all countries.

Major General Ohlman said that we welcome the further strengthening of the close ties that already exist between China and Sweden. We believe that contact between representatives of the military institutions of our two countries is very important for friendship between China and Sweden.

The atmosphere at the banquet was warm and friendly, and the hosts and guests frequently toasted to world peace and to the friendship between the Chinese and Swedish people!

Present at the banquet tonight were General Yang Chengwu, General Fu Zhong, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Lieutenant General Liu ShaoWen, Major General Xie Fang, Air Force Major General Wang Zhitao, Navy Major General Fu Jize, and others.

Vice Foreign Minister Geng Biao also attended the banquet.

The Ambassador of the Kingdom of Sweden to China, Mr. Booker, as well as military attaches of various countries' embassies in China, were also invited to attend the banquet.

Xinhua News Agency, May 6th: General Luo Ruiqing, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, received the military delegation from the Kingdom of Sweden headed by Major General Ohlman this morning and had a cordial conversation.

    罗瑞卿设宴欢迎瑞典王国军事代表团
    新华社6日讯　中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿大将今晚举行宴会，欢迎以奥尔曼少将为首的瑞典王国军事代表团。
    宴会开始，罗瑞卿大将致词说，他代表中国人民解放军全体指战员向瑞典军事代表团前来我国访问表示热烈的欢迎。他说，中国人民和瑞典人民都是热爱和平的。瑞典王国政府的代表在朝鲜中立国监察委员会中所进行的工作，对维护和平的事业作出了贡献。
    罗瑞卿大将说，我国政府始终坚持不同社会制度国家和平共处的原则，一贯主张通过和平协商合理地解决国际间悬而未决的问题，并且愿意在平等互利的基础上同一切国家发展友好关系。我国人民一贯为和缓国际紧张局势进行着不懈的努力。
    罗瑞卿大将说，美国统治集团正在大力扶植日本和西德的军国主义势力，企图把这两个国家再一次变成危险的战争策源地。美帝国主义仍然用武力侵占着我国的领土台湾，并且不顾中国政府的一再警告，不断地侵犯我国的领海和领空，进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。他说，中国人民志愿军早就已经主动撤离朝鲜；而美国军队，不但赖在南朝鲜不走，并且严重地破坏停战协定，屡次非法地把包括导弹在内的现代化武器运进南朝鲜。这一切不能不引起爱好和平的国家和人民的警惕。他说，今天，和平力量已经大大超过战争势力。帝国主义的一切侵略活动和战争阴谋，必将与过去一样遭到可耻的失败。
    奥尔曼少将接着讲话说，我们感到自傲能作为第一个瑞典军事代表团来访问中国，我们同时希望进一步增进早已建立起来的瑞典和中国军队之间的联系。他说，中国和瑞典都曾屡次宣布它们在外交方面的主要愿望是缓和国际局势以及各国之间的良好的友谊关系和世界和平。
    奥尔曼少将说，我们欢迎进一步加强早已存在的中国和瑞典之间的紧密联系。我们相信，我们两国之间军事机构代表们的接触，对中国和瑞典之间友谊是十分重要的。
    席间，洋溢着热烈的友好气氛，宾主频频为世界和平、为中瑞两国人民的友谊而干杯！
    出席今晚宴会的，有杨成武上将、傅钟上将、萧向荣中将、刘少文中将、解方少将、王智涛空军少将、傅继泽海军少将等。
    外交部副部长耿飚也出席了宴会。
    瑞典王国驻我国大使布克以及各国驻华大使馆武官也应邀出席了宴会。
    新华社6日讯　中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿大将今天上午接见了以奥尔曼少将为首的瑞典王国军事代表团，并进行了亲切的交谈。
    接见时，在座的有杨成武上将、傅钟上将、萧向荣中将、解方少将、王智涛空军少将、傅继泽海军少将以及外交部西欧司副司长王进等。
