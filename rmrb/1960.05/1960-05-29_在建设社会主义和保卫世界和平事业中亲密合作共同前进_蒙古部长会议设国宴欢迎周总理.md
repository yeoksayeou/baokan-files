Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, May 28th: The Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic held a grand state banquet in the Government House this evening to warmly welcome Premier Zhou Enlai.

Chairman Tsedenbal and Premier Zhou Enlai, in their speeches at the state banquet, unanimously pointed out that the great friendship between China and Mongolia, built on the foundation of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, will surely be further consolidated and developed.

The grand state banquet began at 8:00 PM. After the band played the national anthems of China and Mongolia, Chairman Tsedenbal first spoke to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests.

He warmly praised China's socialist construction. He said that now, hundreds of millions of Chinese people are building socialism very rapidly according to the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical." The Chinese people have completed the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. The Mongolian people regard the achievements of the fraternal Chinese people as their own achievements, as the achievements of the entire socialist camp, and, like the people of all socialist countries, are sincerely happy and proud of this achievement.

Chairman Tsedenbal said that the People's Republic of China has made great contributions in the past and present to enhancing and consolidating the unity of all the people in our socialist camp and to safeguarding and consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

Speaking of the friendship between Mongolia and China, Chairman Tsedenbal said that since the founding of the great People's Republic of China, the Mongolian and Chinese people have established a solid brotherly and sincere friendship based on the unshakable principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

Chairman Tsedenbal strongly condemned the war policies of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States. He said that they do not want to improve the international situation, they are trying to further incite the "Cold War," engage in a frenzied arms race, and are preparing to launch a devastating new war directed at progressive humanity. The breakdown of the four-power summit conference due to the evil consequences caused by the adventurous aggressive policy of the United States towards the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is proof of this.

Chairman Tsedenbal pointed out that the Mongolian people and government, together with the progressive people of the world, resolutely condemn the provocative acts of the United States and fully support the statement made by Comrade N. S. Khrushchev, head of the Soviet government, at the preparatory meeting of the four-power summit in Paris. He said that the people of the socialist camp are responding to the provocations of the enemies of peace and friendship by further enhancing the strong and unbreakable unity between them.

Premier Zhou Enlai then spoke. He spoke of the achievements of socialist construction in China and Mongolia, the international situation, and the friendship between China and Mongolia. Speaking of the international situation, Premier Zhou said that the situation for striving for world peace and human progress has never been as favorable as it is now. He emphasized that the nature of imperialism will not change, and they will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history. The imperialist aggressive bloc headed by the United States has not relaxed its activities of expanding armaments and preparing for war for a moment. Recently, U.S. imperialism openly carried out aggression and provocation against our great ally, the Soviet Union, and sabotaged the four-power summit conference, which once again exposed its hideous imperialist face. This is determined by its imperialist essence. U.S. imperialism is doing this precisely to show that it has fallen into a dead end.

Premier Zhou said that China and Mongolia are close comrades-in-arms and brothers in the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, and we resolutely support the solemn measures taken by the Soviet government against the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism. The Soviet Union's just struggle against U.S. imperialism has powerfully struck at the arrogance of imperialism and encouraged the peace-loving people of the world. The 650 million Chinese people, like the fraternal Mongolian people, will continue to unite with the great Soviet people and the people of all socialist countries, unite with all peace-loving people in the world, and resolutely struggle against the aggressive and war policies of the imperialist group headed by the United States, in support of the just struggle of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries for national independence and democratic freedom, and in pursuit of lasting world peace and human progress.

Premier Zhou spoke of the comprehensive development of the friendly relations between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples. He said that with the joint efforts of our two governments and peoples, our great friendship, built on the foundation of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, will surely be further consolidated and developed.

Premier Zhou warmly praised the achievements made by the hardworking and simple Mongolian people in their construction. He said that the fraternal Mongolian people will surely continue to achieve brilliant successes in realizing the great task of completing the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Premier Zhou finally said, let us further join hands and cooperate closely and advance together in the cause of building socialism and defending world peace!

The speeches of Chairman Tsedenbal and Premier Zhou Enlai were greeted with extremely warm applause.

This evening, Vice Premier Chen Yi and all the accompanying Chinese comrades, as well as Xie Fusheng, the Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia, were invited to attend the state banquet.

Also attending the state banquet were Mongolian party and government leaders Sambu, Tsende, Molomjamts, Dugersuren, Baljinniam, Jagvaral, Lhamsuren, Maidar, and other comrades, as well as people from all walks of life in Mongolia. Diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Mongolia were also invited to attend the state banquet.

The grand state banquet proceeded in an atmosphere full of friendship. During the banquet, Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman Tsedenbal, and Vice Premier Chen Yi and others also strolled around the hall, toasting and drinking with the people attending the state banquet. (Attached picture)

    在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平事业中亲密合作共同前进
    蒙古部长会议设国宴欢迎周总理
    泽登巴尔主席谴责美国的侵略政策，指出社会主义各国将以牢不可破的团结来回答敌人的挑衅
    周总理说中国坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义集团的侵略和战争政策，支持各国人民正义斗争
    新华社乌兰巴托28日电  蒙古人民共和国部长会议今天晚间在政府大厦举行盛大国宴热烈欢迎周恩来总理。
    泽登巴尔主席和周恩来总理在国宴上讲话中一致指出，建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的中蒙两国伟大友谊一定能够获得进一步的巩固和发展。
    盛大的国宴在晚间八时开始。乐队奏中蒙两国的国歌以后，泽登巴尔主席首先讲话欢迎中国贵宾。
    他热情地赞扬了中国的社会主义建设。他说，现在，几亿中国人民正在按照“多、快、好、省”的原则，非常迅速地建设着社会主义。中国人民已经提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的任务。蒙古人民把兄弟的中国人民取得的成就，看作是自己的成就，是整个社会主义阵营的成就，同社会主义各国人民一样，对这一成就感到由衷的高兴和自豪。
    泽登巴尔主席说，中华人民共和国过去和现在对增进和巩固我们社会主义阵营全体人民的团结，维护并巩固亚洲和世界和平方面，作出巨大贡献。
    在谈到蒙中两国友谊的时候，泽登巴尔主席说，从伟大的中华人民共和国成立时候起，蒙中人民根据马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的不可动摇的原则，建立了牢固的兄弟般的真诚友谊。
    泽登巴尔主席强烈谴责以美国为首的帝国主义集团的战争政策。他说，它们不希望改善国际局势，企图进一步煽动“冷战”，进行狂热的军备竞赛，正在准备发动矛头指向进步人类的毁灭性的新战争。由于美国对苏联和其他社会主义国家奉行冒险的侵略政策所引起的恶果，四国首脑会议遭到破坏，这就是一个证明。
    泽登巴尔主席指出，蒙古人民和政府和全世界的进步人们一道，坚决谴责美国的挑衅行为，完全支持苏联政府首脑尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在巴黎四国首脑预备会议上发表的声明。他说，社会主义阵营各国人民正以进一步增进他们之间的坚强的和牢不可破的团结来回答和平和友谊的敌人的挑衅。
    周恩来总理接着讲话。他从中蒙两国的社会主义建设的成就谈到了国际局势，也谈到了中蒙两国的友谊。在谈到国际局势时，周总理说，争取世界和平和人类进步的形势从来没有像现在这样有利。他强调指出，帝国主义的本性是不会变的，他们不会自动退出历史舞台。以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团，一刻也没有放松过他们扩军备战的活动。最近，美帝国主义公然对我们伟大盟邦苏联进行了侵略和挑衅，破坏了四国政府首脑会议，这就再一次暴露了它的帝国主义的狰狞面目。这是由它的帝国主义本质决定的。美帝国主义这样做，正是表现它已陷入日暮途穷的境地。
    周总理说，我们中蒙两国是以伟大苏联为首的社会主义阵营的亲密战友和兄弟，我们坚决支持苏联政府对美帝国主义的侵略罪行所采取的严正措施。苏联对美帝国主义所进行的正义斗争，有力地打击了帝国主义气焰，鼓舞了全世界爱好和平的人民。六亿五千万中国人民同兄弟的蒙古人民一样，将继续同伟大的苏联人民和所有社会主义各国人民团结在一起，同全世界一切爱好和平的人民团结在一起，为反对以美国为首的帝国主义集团的侵略政策和战争政策，支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族独立和民主自由的正义斗争，争取世界持久和平和人类进步，进行坚决的斗争。
    周总理谈到了中蒙两国人民的友好关系全面发展的情况。他说，在我们两国政府和人民的共同努力下，我们两国建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的伟大友谊一定能够获得进一步的巩固和发展。
    周总理热情赞扬勤劳纯朴的蒙古人民在建设中取得的成就。他说，兄弟的蒙古人民在实现提前完成三年计划的伟大任务中，一定能够继续取得辉煌的成就。周总理最后说，让我们进一步地携起手来，在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的事业中亲密合作，共同前进！
    泽登巴尔主席和周恩来总理的讲话受到了极其热烈的欢迎。
    今晚，陈毅副总理和随行的全体中国同志，以及中国驻蒙古大使谢甫生等都应邀出席了国宴。
    出席国宴的，有蒙古人民共和国党政领导人桑布、曾德、莫洛姆扎木茨、杜格苏伦、巴尔吉尼雅姆、扎格瓦拉尔、拉姆苏伦、迈达尔等同志，以及蒙古各方面的人士。各国驻蒙古的外交使节也应邀出席了国宴。
    盛大的国宴一直在充满友谊的气氛中进行。席间，周恩来总理、泽登巴尔主席和陈毅副总理等还漫步全场，同参加国宴的人们祝酒干杯。（附图片）
