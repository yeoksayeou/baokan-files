    Using Natural Energy to Serve Production
    Guangdong's Rural Areas Mobilize Millions to Build Hydropower Stations
    Anhui Widely Utilizes Hydropower, Wind Power, and Biogas
    (Our Dispatch) Guangdong Province is organizing a mass movement of one million people to build rural hydropower stations and hydroelectric power stations, in order to solve the urgent power needs for the current agricultural technology transformation.
    Guangdong Province has made great achievements in building rural hydropower stations and hydroelectric power stations in the past two years. The province currently has nearly one thousand hydroelectric power stations, with a power generation capacity of more than 21,900 kilowatts; more than 15,000 hydropower stations, with a total of more than 81,000 horsepower. These hydropower stations and hydroelectric power stations are located throughout the province and have played a huge role in agricultural and sideline production. In the past, Gueigang Commune in Liangyang County needed more than 500 laborers to process grain using human and animal power. After the construction of hydroelectric power stations and hydropower stations, only more than 100 laborers were needed. The hydraulic automatic joint processing plant of Dawan Commune in Yingde County uses hydropower to drive 66 kinds of indigenous and foreign machines, forming eight workshops including forging, sand casting, hardware repair, grain processing, agricultural and sideline product processing, pesticides, fertilizers, and hydroelectric power stations. The number of workers required by the entire plant was reduced from 880 to 141, while labor efficiency was greatly improved compared to the past.
    In the mass construction of hydropower stations and hydroelectric power stations in Guangdong, indigenous methods are implemented, combining indigenous and foreign methods. The construction technology of the stations is also very simple and easy for the masses to master. The "three craftsmen" in the countryside—carpenters, blacksmiths, and masons—played a key role in the construction of the stations. The water turbines of most hydropower stations and hydroelectric power stations in the province are made of wood instead of iron. In plain areas lacking wood, such as Chao'an County, ceramic propeller-type water turbines have also been created. They are durable, smooth, and have a rotation speed efficiency of 7% higher than that of wooden water turbines.
    Guangdong Province has extremely abundant water resources, abundant rainfall, and crisscrossing rivers. In addition, in the past ten years, hundreds of thousands of reservoirs and mountain ponds have been built, and canals are crisscrossed, providing extremely favorable conditions for the utilization of water resources.
    (Our Dispatch) Anhui's rural areas are widely using natural energy such as hydropower, wind power, and biogas to serve various rural productions and farmers' lives.
    The use of hydropower for agricultural and sideline product processing and the use of hydropower for power generation are being widely promoted in people's communes throughout Anhui. She County, a mountainous area in southern Anhui that produces the famous tea "Tunlv," has built more than 200 hydropower (electricity) stations. Every people's commune has hydropower generation. Hydropower has been used in more than 20 kinds of production such as tea making, papermaking, sawing wood, grain, oil, cotton and feed processing, starch making, extracting wild plant oil, and driving lathes. 90% of the county's flour, 80% of corn flour, and 50% of rice and feed are processed using hydropower.
    At present, a large number of wind turbines have been installed throughout the province, with Bengbu Prefecture promoting them the fastest. The 12 wind turbines that have been installed in the suburbs of Bengbu City have eight models, including single-tail, no-tail, stretched tarpaulin without side panels, and each has its own advantages. The wind turbines manufactured in various places can drive processing tools in the case of a two-and-a-half level wind, and can generate electricity at about a three-level wind. A four-level wind allows both electricity generation and processing.
    The utilization of biogas has begun to be widely promoted on both sides of the Huai River and in the north and south of the Yangtze River. According to statistics at the end of last year, there were more than 75,000 biogas digesters put into production throughout the province, 5.96 million field fertilizer cellars for biogas and fermentation, 1,836 biogas-fired canteens, 90,000 households with biogas lighting, 3 biogas power stations, and 97 biogas processing stations.

    利用自然能源为生产服务
    广东农村百万人大办水力水电站
    安徽广泛利用水力、风力和沼气
    本报讯　广东省正在组织有一百万人参加的大办农村水力站、水电站运动，以解决当前农业技术改造所急需的动力问题。
    广东省最近两年来大办农村水力站、水电站取得了很大成绩。全省现有水电站近一千座，发电能力达二万一千九百多瓩；水力站一万五千多座，共有八万一千多马力。这些水力站、水电站遍布全省各地，在农副业生产中发挥了巨大作用。两阳县圭岗公社过去用人畜力加工粮食需要用五百多个劳动力，建成水电站和水力站后，只需要一百多个劳动力就够了。英德县大湾公社水力自动联合加工厂，利用水力带动各种土洋机器六十六台，组成锻工、翻砂、五金修配、粮食加工、农副产品加工、农药、农肥及水电站等八个车间，使全厂所需的工人从八百八十人减到一百四十一人，而劳动效率比过去大大提高。
    广东在大办水力站、水电站中，实行土法上马，土洋结合，建站技术也很简便，容易为群众所掌握，农村中的“三匠”——木匠、铁匠和泥水匠，在建站中起了骨干作用。全省绝大部分水力站、水电站的水轮机，都是以木代铁制成的。缺乏木材的平原地区如潮安县，还创制了陶瓷旋桨式水轮机，质坚耐用，光滑顺溜，转速效率比木制水轮机提高7％。
    广东省水力资源极为丰富，雨量充沛，河川交错，加上十年来兴建了几十万宗水库、山塘，渠道纵横，在水力资源的利用上，有着极为优越的条件。
    本报讯　安徽农村广泛利用水力、风力和沼气等自然能源，为农村各项生产和农民生活服务。
    利用水力进行农、副产品加工和利用水力发电，正在安徽各地人民公社普遍推广。皖南山区出产名茶“屯绿”的歙县，已建成水力（电）站二百多处，每个人民公社都有了水力发电，水力已用于制茶、造纸、锯木、粮油棉和饲料加工、制淀粉、提炼野生植物油、带动车床等二十多种生产。全县90％的面粉、80％的玉米粉和50％的大米和饲料，都利用水力加工。
    现在全省已安装好大批风力机，其中以蚌埠专区推广最快。蚌埠市郊区已安装的十二部风力机，就有单尾巴、无尾巴、拉布篷没有侧叶板等八种型号，而且各有优点。各地制造的风力机，一般在两级半风的情况下，就可带动加工工具，三级风左右就可发电，有四级风就可同时进行发电和加工。
    沼气的利用，已开始在淮河两岸和长江南北部普遍推广。据去年年底统计，全省已投入生产的沼气池就达七万五千多个，沼气、发酵两用的田头积肥窖有五百九十六万个，沼气化食堂有一千八百三十六个，沼气照明九万户，沼气发电站三个，沼气加工站九十七处。（附图片）
