Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 15th: According to a report by Antara News Agency, the Indonesian Attorney General's Office has been summoning leaders of the suspended Overseas Chinese newspaper "Shenghuo Bao" these past few days. The reason for ordering the newspaper to cease publication on the 13th was that it published on May 6th, 9th, and 11th news deemed to have "extreme bias" and "deliberately" contradicting the Indonesian Attorney General Gunawan's statement regarding Chinese ships sent to "transport Overseas Chinese back to their home country escaping Indonesian territorial waters."

Antara News Agency quoted sources from the Attorney General's Office as saying that after interrogating the leaders of "Shenghuo Bao," new decisions will be made regarding the people involved, that is, whether to submit the issue to the court for trial or take other measures. People point out that this Overseas Chinese newspaper may be subjected to further persecution.

    印度尼西亚最高检察署
    无理传讯华侨报纸“生活报”领导人
    新华社雅加达15日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚最高检察署这几天正在传讯被停刊的华侨报纸“生活报”的领导人。这家报纸在13日被勒令停刊的理由是由于它在5月6日、9日和11日刊载了被认为有“极大倾向性”和“故意”刊载了同印度尼西亚最高检察长贡纳万关于中国派遣的“接运华侨回国的船只逃出印度尼西亚领海”的谈话相反的消息。
    安塔拉通讯社援引最高检察署人士的话说，在审讯“生活报”的领导人以后，将对有关的人作出新的决定，即，将这个问题交法院审理或者采取其它措施。人们指出，这家华侨报纸可能受到进一步的迫害。
