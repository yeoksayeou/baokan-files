Chongqing Two Small Factories Leap to Automation
Chengdu Slaughterhouse Creates Complete Set of Pig Slaughtering Machines

(Our Report) The Chongqing Tea Factory workers, after more than forty days of hard work, have transformed a manual tea factory into an automated factory. The quality of the tea fully preserves the advantages of manual tea production.

In the past, this factory was almost entirely manual. Sorting tea and removing stems alone required 1,400 people. Now, the entire tea production process is composed of 48 machines connected into production lines, with workers directing operations through a production control panel. The control panel is equipped with signal lights; if a machine malfunctions, the light will send a signal, and maintenance personnel will go to the site to repair and inspect it based on the signal.

This factory mainly produces black tea and green tea for export. Export black tea has eight grades, each composed of finished tea of different lengths, thicknesses, and weights. The tea must not contain stems or impurities. Therefore, in the past, some people believed that only manually produced tea could guarantee quality. However, after testing, the black tea produced by machines is of the same quality as that meticulously crafted by hand, with high aroma and purity. Moreover, because the machine operations are more accurate, the quality is even more guaranteed.

Automated production has created favorable conditions for the Chongqing Tea Factory to continuously leap forward. After mechanization, the production capacity first increased by 2.2 times, meeting the need to double black tea production this year. The factory has overfulfilled its first-quarter production plan ahead of schedule by thirteen days. Secondly, it has saved 90% of the workers. Currently, the tea factory has transferred some people to establish and develop tea bases to provide a more sufficient supply of raw materials for the factory's production development. At the same time, it has sent some people to rural areas to help rural people's communes establish tea factories and improve the production of rough tea.

(Our Report) After more than twenty days of hard work, the Chongqing Fengmingshan Non-Staple Food Joint Processing Factory has completely transformed the manual production of starch, vermicelli, and chili powder into automated production. After the automation of starch, vermicelli, and chili powder production, the number of workers in these three workshops has been reduced from 118 to 18; however, production efficiency has increased by one to five times, respectively.

This factory is a small factory with simple equipment. Apart from two repair workers, there was almost no technical expertise in the entire factory. However, they all have the ambitious aspiration to "leap to the sky in one step." Zheng Naixing, a member of the shock team and the Communist Youth League, encountered the difficulty of the chili skin and seeds not being able to separate automatically when manufacturing the chili crushing machine. They, based on the principle of using a windmill to fan rice to remove ash and slag in rural areas, added electric blades, which separated the skin and seeds. When the dryer was drying the chili skin, it needed to dry it while also automatically throwing it out and sending it to an electric mill for grinding. Zheng Naixing and others discovered that the principle of the slurry filter in the starch workshop rotating and throwing slag could be adopted, so they went to the starch workshop to understand and learn. In this way, after only five days and nights of hard work, an automated production line for sealed processing of chili powder was born. This automated production line increased the daily output of chili powder from 150 jin by manual operation to 450 jin, and the number of operators was reduced from eight to two.

(Our Report) The Chengdu Food Company Slaughterhouse employees started from scratch and created a complete set of pig slaughtering machines, increasing work efficiency by more than 30 times.

Workers describe the past situation of manual pig slaughtering as: "Slaughtering pigs alarms the neighbors, carrying pigs causes sweat like rain, struggling with pigs all day long, and backaches from exhaustion." Now they have achieved: "Pigs don't squeal when slaughtered, pigs are transported by chutes, machines are used for skinning, knives are not used for splitting, hair removal is mechanized, and operation is light and skillful." Such as the anesthesia electric platform they created to anesthetize live pigs waiting to be slaughtered. Combined with other machines, three or four people per shift can slaughter more than 4,000 pigs, while in the past, three or four people per shift could only slaughter fifty or sixty pigs.

The employees of this slaughterhouse were all pig slaughterers by origin, with low levels of education and no understanding of science and technology. At the same time, the factory did not even have a pair of pliers. However, they dared to think and act, diligently studied based on their years of pig slaughtering experience, and humbly learned from the advanced experience of brother factories, thinking, experimenting, designing, and manufacturing at the same time. Finally, they made more than 40 machines, such as anesthesia electric platforms, electric skinning machines, electric hair removal machines, splitting machines, overhead chutes, and hanging scalding.

    重庆两小厂一步登天实现自动化
    成都屠宰厂创造整套杀猪机器
    本报讯　重庆茶厂职工奋战四十多天，把一座手工操作的茶叶厂变成了自动化工厂。茶叶质量，完全保持了手工制茶的优点。
    过去这个工厂几乎全是手工操作，单是拣茶拣梗，就曾用过一千四百人。现在整个茶叶生产由四十八台作业机器，连成一条条生产作业线，工人通过生产控制台指挥操作。控制台上装有讯号指示灯，哪台机器发生故障，指示灯就会发出信号，检修人员根据指示，到现场进行修理、检查。
    这个厂主要生产外销红茶和绿茶。外销红茶共有八个等级，每一个等级都由不同长短、粗细、轻重的成品茶拼成；茶叶里面不能带茶梗和杂质。因此过去有人认为只有手工制作的茶叶才能保证质量。但是，经过检验，用机器生产的红茶，质量和手工精制时一样，茶叶的香气和净度都很高。而且由于机器操作的动作更准确，因而质量更有保证。
    自动化生产为重庆茶厂持续跃进创造了有利条件。机械化以后，首先是生产能力比原来提高了二点二倍，满足了今年红茶生产翻番的需要。这个厂已提前十三天超额完成了第一季度的生产计划。其次是节约了90％的工人。目前茶厂已经抽调了一部分人去建立和发展茶叶基地，为本厂发展生产供应更充分的原料，同时又派了一部分人到农村去帮助农村人民公社兴办茶厂，改进毛茶的制作。
    本报讯　重庆市凤鸣山副食品联合加工厂经过二十多天的奋战，把生产淀粉、粉条、辣椒面的手工操作，全部改为自动化生产，淀粉、粉条、辣椒面的生产实现自动化后，这三个车间的工人由一百一十八人减少到十八人；生产效率却分别提高了一倍到五倍。
    这个厂是个小厂，设备简陋，全厂除了两个修配工人外，几乎没有什么技术力量。但是他们都有“一步登天”的雄心大志。突击队队员、共青团员郑乃兴在制造碎椒机时，遇到椒皮和椒子不能自动分开的困难。他们根据农村用风车扇稻谷去灰渣的原理，加上电动叶片，就使皮和籽分开了。烘干器烘椒皮的时候，既要能烘干，又要解决自动甩出来，送到电磨上去磨的问题。郑乃兴等发现淀粉车间滤浆机转动甩渣的原理可以采用，就跑到淀粉车间去了解和学习。就这样，只经过五昼夜的奋战，一条密封加工辣椒面的自动生产线就诞生了。这条自动生产线使辣椒面的日产量由手工操作时的一百五十斤猛增到四百五十斤，操作工人还由八人减少成两个人。
    本报讯　成都市食品公司屠宰厂职工白手起家，创造了一整套杀猪的机器，提高工效三十多倍。
    工人形容过去手工杀猪的情况是：“杀猪惊动四邻，抬猪汗如雨淋，终日与猪搏斗，累得腰酸背疼。”现在做到了：“杀猪猪不叫，运猪用滑道，剥皮使机器，开边不用刀，刮毛机械化，操作轻又巧。”如他们创造的使活猪麻晕待宰的麻电台。结合其他机具，每班三、四个人就可以杀四千多只猪，而过去每班三、四个人只能杀五、六十头猪。
    这个屠宰厂的职工都是杀猪匠出身，文化水平低，不懂科学技术。同时，厂里连一把老虎钳都没有。但是，他们敢想敢干，根据多年杀猪的经验，刻苦钻研，并且虚心学习兄弟厂的先进经验，边想，边试验，边设计，边制造。终于制成了麻电台、电动剥皮机、电动刮毛机、开边机、架空滑道、吊烫等四十多种机器。
