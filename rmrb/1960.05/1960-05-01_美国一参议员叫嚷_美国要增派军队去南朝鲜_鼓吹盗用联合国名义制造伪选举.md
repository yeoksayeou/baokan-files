Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: U.S. Senator Keating yesterday gave a speech in the Senate, clamoring that "if the disturbances (in South Korea) continue for a long time," the United States and the "United Nations" should "increase troops there" to help and support the South Korean "provisional government" in rebuilding so-called "peace and stability" within the country.

This senator also said that sham elections "supervised by United Nations representatives" should be held in South Korea "as soon as possible." He also advocated concocting this election under the threat of the bayonets of the U.S. troops invading Korea. He said, "The United States must not hesitate to place its (troops invading Korea) under the command of South Korean officials to ensure a calm and fair referendum."

Keating declared that the United States must maintain its colonial rule in South Korea for a long time. He said that a large number of Americans lost their lives in order to so-called "save South Korea from aggression," and that "the United States has provided a large amount of necessary military, economic, and technical assistance since the Korean War (referring to the U.S. war of aggression against Korea) to ensure the independence of South Korea." He exclaimed: "The blood of American children and the dollars of American taxpayers must not be shed and wasted in Korea."

    美国一参议员叫嚷
    美国要增派军队去南朝鲜
    鼓吹盗用联合国名义制造伪选举
    据新华社30日讯　美国参议员基廷昨天在参议院发表演说时叫嚷说，“如果（南朝鲜的）纷扰长期继续下去”，美国和“联合国”应该“增派军队到那里去”，以帮助和支持南朝鲜“临时政府”重建国内的所谓“和平和稳定”。
    这个参议员还说，“应尽快地”在南朝鲜举行“需要联合国代表来监督”的伪选举。他并且鼓吹要在侵朝美军的刺刀的威胁下，来泡制这次选举。他说，“美国必须毫不犹豫地把它的（侵略朝鲜的）军队交由韩国（南朝鲜）官员指挥，以保证进行一次平静和公平的公民投票。”
    基廷声言美国必须长期保持美国在南朝鲜的殖民统治。他说，大量的美国人为了所谓“拯救韩国不受进攻”而丧失了他们的生命，“美国自朝鲜战争（指美国侵略朝鲜战争）以来提供了大量必要的军事、经济和技术援助，以确保韩国的独立”。他大叫道：“美国孩子的鲜血和美国纳税人的美元决不能在朝鲜白流和白花。”
