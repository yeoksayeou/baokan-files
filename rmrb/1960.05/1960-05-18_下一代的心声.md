    Editor's Note:
    The Voice of the Next Generation
    More than a year ago, in the column "Children's Poems," we published poems by children from the Guolin Commune in Huailai County, Hebei Province. Later, we published a short article by Comrade Guo Moruo entitled "Reading 'Children's Poems.'" Since last year, under the guidance of the Party and elders, children and young people have participated in the nationwide Great Leap Forward and written more poems to express their love for the Party and Chairman Mao, their praise for the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, their joy for a happy life, and their great ambition to build communism. The Youth Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League recently compiled a book called "A Hundred Poems Selected by Children and Young People," for which Comrade Guo Moruo wrote another passage.
    The ten poems published here are selected from "A Hundred Poems Selected by Children and Young People." Ten poems are not many, but can't we see from here the ever-improving steps of our next generation and their aspirations for communism?

    下一代的心声
    一年多以前，我们在“孩子的诗”这一栏里，曾经发表过河北省怀来县果林公社孩子们的诗歌，后来又登过郭沫若同志“读‘孩子的诗’”的一篇短文。去年以来，在党的教导和长辈们的指引下，少年儿童在参加全民大跃进的同时，写了更多的诗歌，来表达他们对党和毛主席的热爱，对总路线、大跃进和人民公社的歌颂，对幸福生活的欢乐和建设共产主义的雄心大志。共青团中央少年部最近编了一本书，叫“少年儿童诗选一百首”，郭沫若同志为这本书又写了一段话。
    这里发表的十首，就是从“少年儿童诗选一百首”里选出来的。十首诗不算多，但是，从这里我们不是能够看到我们下一代的天天向上的步伐和向往共产主义的心声么？
