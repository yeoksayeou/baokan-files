Large numbers of cadres in Zhejiang go deep into the fields to lead the masses in meticulous harvesting.
Zaoyang, Hubei establishes a responsibility system to improve wheat harvesting quality. Anshun Prefecture, Guizhou launches a "small summer harvest" campaign.

(By this newspaper from) Hangzhou, May 26th. The spring flower crop harvesting work in Zhejiang Province is being carried out comprehensively from southern to northern Zhejiang. As of May 23rd, the province had harvested over 7,920,000 mu of wheat, broad beans, peas, and rapeseed. In the process of harvesting spring flower crops, all areas have adhered to meticulous harvesting, ensuring that every grain is brought into the granary, and many areas that have harvested wheat, broad beans, peas, and rapeseed have done so in a single pass. Some areas have promptly organized re-threshing to ensure a bumper harvest.

Zhejiang Province has a large spring flower harvesting area, high yields, and a tight season this year. In addition, there have been many rainy days in the past, so the harvesting workload is very heavy. In order to ensure meticulous harvesting and a bumper harvest, Party committee secretaries and leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into the fields to participate in harvesting, reaping, transporting, threshing, drying, and storage, both working alongside commune members and summarizing and studying specific measures for meticulous harvesting, setting an example and educating the masses. More than 2,000 Party committee secretaries and leading cadres in the Wenzhou Special Zone have been going deep into the fields since the spring flower harvest began, strengthening specific leadership in meticulous harvesting. The Ningbo Special Zone organized more than 3,000 cadres at the county, commune, and brigade levels to go deep into the fields, participate in harvesting, conduct timely inspections, and hold more than 150 on-site meetings to promote various advanced experiences. The Baolian Production Team of the Choucheng Commune in Yiwu County achieved "light placement, light bundling, and light transportation" in harvesting spring crops, ensuring a bumper harvest. The county Party committee seized this typical example and promoted a campaign of "harvesting clean, threshing clean, sweeping clean, and picking clean" throughout the county, ensuring that every grain is brought into the granary.

In light of the characteristics of this year's spring flower harvest, which include a large harvesting area, a tight early rice transplanting season, and concentrated labor input, all areas have vigorously promoted and used various advanced tools, which has not only accelerated the progress of spring flower harvesting, transportation, threshing, and drying, but also ensured the quality of the harvest. The province has promoted 540,000 large sickles, 100,000 rapid harvesters, and more than 168,000 threshing machines. Jinhua County has established 120 electric and hydraulic power stations, driving 468 threshing machines to carry out threshing work. Zhu Jiaxi, Secretary of the Party Committee of the 23 Li Commune in Yiwu County, and Yu Hongfu, Deputy Secretary, went to the Quantang and Xiazhuzhai Production Teams respectively, participating in production while helping the production teams solve the problem of "three-way coordination" of tools, technology, and labor in the five major processes of spring flower harvesting, transporting, threshing, drying, and storage, and adopting different tools according to different natural conditions. For example, flatland transportation uses vehicles, mountain transportation uses rice rack picks, and threshing uses ash grinders, all of which have increased work efficiency by three to five times compared to the original.

In order to ensure meticulous harvesting of spring flowers, all areas have given full play to the superiority of the people's communes, rationally arranged labor, and established specialized teams (groups) for harvesting, threshing, transporting, drying, and storage according to the specialties of the commune members, implementing the "five determinations and three guarantees" responsibility system of "fixed personnel, fixed tasks, fixed quality, fixed time, and fixed work points" and "guaranteeing season, guaranteeing quality, and guaranteeing management," so that the spring flower harvest is fast and good. In the spring flower harvest in Zhuji County, more than 11,000 professional teams (groups) were organized with Party members and League members as the backbone to carry out labor competitions for harvesting, threshing, transporting, drying, and managing, inspecting and promoting each other to ensure meticulous harvesting of spring flower crops.

(By this newspaper from) News Zhejiang Province's well-known model of meticulous harvesting – the Mulan Team of the Jiuli Production Team of the Xin’an Commune in Ruian County, further innovated harvesting tools and improved harvesting methods in this year's spring flower crop harvest, doing a better job of summer harvesting. Their advanced experience in meticulous harvesting is being promoted in Ruian County and throughout the province.

The Mulan Team recently designed and manufactured a rapeseed threshing machine, which threshes rapeseed cleanly and quickly. After comparative tests, each mu of rapeseed can yield more than 10 jin more rapeseed than threshing with the old method, and work efficiency is also increased by more than one time. They also converted the rice thresher into a wheat thresher, which can yield about 3 jin more wheat per mu, and work efficiency is increased by one time.

While vigorously innovating harvesting tools, the sisters of the Mulan Team also created a whole set of advanced experiences such as rapid harvesting methods and assembly line threshing methods. They mastered the timing of rapeseed when it is 80% ripe and harvested at 100%, making a sudden rush to harvest, while adopting dew threshing. The rapeseed is harvested before sunrise, dried in the field for one day, and threshed before sunrise the next day. Because the rapeseed pods are damp, they are not easily burst, so losses can be avoided during harvesting, handling, and threshing. Harvesting wheat also achieves fast knife heavy cutting, small handful light placement, more beating and more shaking, beating light and clean. Everyone carries bamboo baskets with them while harvesting, picking up the wheat ears while cutting.

The Mulan Team's experience in meticulous harvesting is being promoted throughout the county, and more than 3,000 men and women commune members have visited the Mulan Team. The sisters of the Mulan Team also went to various places to give demonstration performances of operating techniques. At present, more than 120,000 men and women commune members throughout the county have learned the Mulan Team's meticulous harvesting operating techniques, and are conscientiously doing fine harvesting in the spring flower harvest.

(By this newspaper from) News Zaoyang County, Hubei Province, summarized the experience of "reaping, bundling, and transporting without dropping ears, and threshing, drying, and loading without losing grain" in harvesting barley, so as to achieve rushing to harvest wheat and ensuring every grain is brought into the granary.

The county's wheat, broad beans, and peas are growing unprecedentedly well. The county Party committee, in view of the fact that this year's summer harvest crops have a large area, grow well, and are tight on work, and the masses are prone to the idea that it doesn’t matter if a little is dropped, paid special attention to meticulous harvesting work. During the harvest, Sun Jianxiu, First Secretary of the Zaoyang County Party Committee, and others focused on going deep into the production teams. They found that the Shenfan Production Team of the Wudian People’s Commune, due to the good preparation of labor arrangements, threshing tools, and threshing grounds, ensured that barley was harvested as soon as it turned yellow, and successfully completed the harvesting task. However, the fourth team of the adjacent Jinhui Production Team, because the preparations for the rush harvest were not well done, harvesting, transportation, and threshing were disconnected from each other, and 18 laborers only harvested 5 mu of barley a day, and many wheat ears were dropped in the field; 23 mu of barley was cut down in the field for four days and had not yet been transported to the drying ground. The county Party committee educated the masses through these typical examples, making everyone realize that the past loss of ears and grains during harvesting was mainly because the work was not done well, and that as long as a strict wheat harvesting responsibility system is established and labor and work are arranged well, it is entirely possible to achieve no loss of ears or grains during wheat harvesting.

Now, the county has universally established a wheat harvesting "four determinations" (fixed mu, time, quality, and work points) responsibility system. The Zishan People's Commune has prepared both indoor and outdoor threshing grounds. The commune’s 59,000 mu of wheat has been arranged at a ratio of 15 to 20 mu requiring one threshing ground. Each threshing ground has also built two to three temporary field houses, and prepared a batch of large rain tarpaulins to grab the ground in case of rain during threshing. The commune has also vacated 212 vacant houses, and threshes wheat in the houses on rainy days to speed up the threshing speed. The county has also organized 50,000 children to participate in picking up wheat. In addition, a quality inspection system for meticulous harvesting has been established from top to bottom, so that harvesting, transportation, threshing and other work are closely linked and everything is meticulous.

(By this newspaper from) News Anshun Prefecture, Guizhou Province, after the summer harvest was basically completed, universally launched a "small summer harvest" campaign. According to statistics from Xingren, Langdai, and Zhenning counties alone, in the last six days, more than 200,000 mu of wheat and rapeseed have been re-threshed, yielding more than 780,000 jin of wheat and more than 330,000 jin of rapeseed.

During the summer harvest, in accordance with the instructions of the Anshun Prefectural Party Committee, a "small summer harvest" campaign to harvest clean, thresh clean, and pick clean was carried out throughout the prefecture, so as to ensure that no ear is missed and no grain is dropped. Commune members in Xingren County carried out "five checks" - checking whether the summer harvest crops have been harvested, checking whether the harvested crops have been threshed, checking whether the threshed crops are clean, checking whether the by-products have been collected and stored, and checking whether the threshing grounds and drying dams have been swept clean, and within three days, the county re-threshed and re-harvested more than 50,000 mu of wheat and rapeseed, increasing the harvest by more than 50,000 jin of wheat and 60,000 jin of rapeseed.

(By this newspaper from) News Huatong County, Hunan Province, had re-threshed more than 12,100 mu of rapeseed by the 15th, yielding a total of more than 47,500 jin of rapeseed, an average of more than 3 jin per mu.

The county’s 45,000 mu of rapeseed has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Due to the tight season and many tasks, the main force focused on rushing to plant, and in many places there was a phenomenon of rough harvesting and unclean threshing. In addition to strengthening the ideological education of cadres and commune members on meticulous threshing, fine harvesting, and bumper harvest by the county Party committee, striving to harvest the unharvested parts well and thresh them cleanly, it was also decided to immediately carry out a comprehensive re-threshing of the threshed rapeseed.

    割麦不掉穗　打场不丢粒
    浙江大批干部深入田间领导群众细收细打
    湖北枣阳建立责任制提高麦收质量　贵州安顺专区开展“小夏收”运动
    本报杭州26日电　浙江省春花作物的收获工作，从浙南到浙北全面开展。到本月23日止，全省已收割大小麦、蚕豌豆和油菜籽七百九十二万多亩。各地在收获春花作物中，坚持细收细打，颗粒归仓，全省已收割的大小麦、蚕豌豆和油菜籽，很多地区都作到一次打净，一部分地区已及时组织复打，保证丰产丰收。
    浙江省今年春花收获面积大，产量高，季节紧，加上前段时间阴雨天多，所以收获工作量很大。为保证细收细打，丰产丰收，各级党委书记和领导干部深入田间，参加收、割、运输、脱粒和翻晒、保管，一面和社员一起劳动，一面总结研究细收细打的具体措施，做出样子，教育群众。温州专区各级党委书记和领导干部两千多人，从春花开始收割以来就深入田间，加强对细收细打的具体领导。宁波专区一共组织了县、社、大队三级干部三千多人，深入田间，参加收割，及时检查，召开了一百五十多次现场会，推广了各种先进经验。义乌县稠城公社保联生产队在收割春茬中做到了“轻放、轻捆、轻运”，保证了丰产丰收。县委抓住这个典型，在全县范围内推广了收净、打净、扫净、拾净，颗粒归仓运动。
    各地根据今年春花收获面积大、早稻插秧季节紧、劳动投放集中的特点，大力推广和使用各种先进工具，既加速了春花收割、运输、脱粒、翻晒的进度，又保证了收获质量。全省已经推广了大镰刀五十四万把，快速收割器十万部，脱粒机十六万八千多台。金华县已经建立了一百二十个电力、水力站，带动四百六十八部脱粒机进行脱粒工作。义乌县二十三里公社党委书记朱加喜、副书记虞洪福分别到泉塘和下朱宅生产队，边参加生产，边帮助生产队解决春花收、运、打、晒、藏等五大工序中的工具、技术、劳力“三配套”问题，并根据不同的自然条件采用不同工具。如平原运输用车，山地运输用稻架挑，脱粒采用碾灰机，工效都比原来提高三至五倍。
    为了保证春花细收细打，各地都充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，合理安排了劳力，根据社员的特长，建立了收割、脱粒、运输、翻晒、保管等专业队（组），实行了定人员、定任务、定质量、定时间、定工分和保季节、保质量、保管理的“五定、三保”责任制，使春花收获又快又好。诸暨县在收割春花中，以党团员为骨干，组织了各种专业队
  （组）一万一千多个，开展了收、打、运、晒、管的劳动竞赛，互相检查、互相促进，保证了春花作物细收细打。
    本报讯　闻名浙江全省的细收细打标兵——瑞安县莘塍公社九里生产队花木兰小组，在今年收获春花作物中，进一步革新收打工具，改进收割方法，把夏收工作做得更好。她们细收细打的先进经验，正在瑞安县和全省各地推广。
    这个花木兰小组最近设计制造出油菜脱粒机，脱粒油菜既净且快，经过对比试验，每亩油菜比用老办法脱粒可多收菜籽十多斤，工效也提高一倍以上。她们还把打稻机改装为打麦机，每亩可多收麦子约三斤，工效提高一倍。
    花木兰小组的姐妹们在大闹收打工具革新的同时，还创造出快速收割法、流水作业脱粒法等一整套先进经验。她们掌握了油菜八成熟十成收的时机，突击抢收，同时采取露水脱粒。太阳出来之前就把油菜收割好，放在田里晒一天，第二天太阳出来前脱完粒。因为油菜荚潮湿，不易爆裂，收割、搬运和脱粒时就可避免损失。收割麦子也做到快刀重割、小把轻放、多打多抖、打光打净。她们收割中人人随带竹篓，边割边拾光麦穗。
    花木兰小组细收细打的经验正在全县推广，全县先后有三千多人到花木兰小组参观访问。花木兰小组的姐妹们还到各地巡回表演操作技术。目前全县共有十二万多男女社员学会了花木兰小组的细收细打操作技术，在收获春花中切实做到精打细收。
    本报讯　湖北省枣阳县总结收割大麦中“割、捆、运不掉穗，打、晒、装不丢粒”的经验，做到抢收小麦颗粒归仓。
    这个县的麦子、蚕豆、豌豆生长空前良好。县委针对今年夏收作物面积大，长的好，活路紧，群众容易产生抛撒一点不在乎的思想，因而特别注意了细收细打工作。收割时，中共枣阳县委第一书记孙建修等重点深入到生产队。他们发现吴店人民公社沈畈生产队，由于劳动力安排、脱粒工具、打麦场等准备的好，保证了大麦黄一块、收一块，胜利地完成了收割任务。而相邻的金辉生产队第四小队，因为抢收准备工作没搞好，收割、运输、脱粒互相脱节，十八个劳动力一天只割五亩大麦，地里掉了不少麦穗；二十三亩大麦割倒在田里四天还未运到晒场上。县委通过这些典型事例教育群众，使大家认识到：过去收割掉穗、掉粒主要是因为工作没有作好，只要建立严格的麦收责任制度，安排好劳动力和活路，实现麦收不掉穗、不丢粒是完全可能的。
    现在，这个县已普遍建立了麦收“四定”（定田亩、时间、质量、工分）责任制度。资山人民公社已经作好室内室外两套打麦场的准备。全社五万九千多亩小麦，按十五亩到二十亩需要一处打麦场的比例，进行了安排。每个打麦场还盖起了二至三间临时场房，并准备了一批大雨布，以便打麦时遇雨抢场。全公社还腾出了二百一十二间空闲房屋，下雨天就在房内打麦，加快脱粒速度。全县还组织了五万个儿童参加捡麦。另外，自上而下都建立了细收细打的质量检查制度，使收割、运输、脱粒等工作环环扣紧，样样精细。
    本报讯　贵州省安顺专区在夏收基本结束后，普遍开展“小夏收”运动。仅兴仁、郎岱、镇宁三个县统计，在最近六天，共复打小麦、油菜二十多万亩，收得小麦七十八万多斤，菜籽三十三万多斤。
    在夏收中，各地根据中共安顺地委指示，在全区开展收净、打净、拣净的“小夏收”运动，做到一穗不漏，一粒不丢。兴仁县社员通过“五查——查夏收作物是否收割完、查已收的是否脱粒、查已脱粒的是否干净、查副产物是否收好藏好、查打场晒坝是否扫净，三天内全县复打复收小麦、油菜五万多亩，增收小麦五万多斤，油菜籽六万多斤。
    本报讯　湖南省会同县到15日止已复打油菜一万二千一百多亩，共得菜籽四万七千五百多斤，每亩平均三斤多。
    这个县的四万五千亩油菜获得空前大丰收。由于季节紧，活路多，主要力量集中搞抢插，不少地方出现收的粗糙、打的不净的现象。县委除对干部、社员加强细打细收、丰产丰收的思想教育，力争把未收部分收好打净外，并决定对已脱粒的油菜立即全面进行复打。（附图片）
