    Vow Not to Pull the Trigger for Wars of Aggression
    Yamamoto Ichizo (26 years old), Member of the Tokyo "Self-Defense Force"

    We are absolutely not picking up guns, sacrificing our lives, for the sake of walking "the old road of the past." It was only because I believed in the "necessity of purely defensive means" that I chose this dirty profession. However, it seems that now, this "army for self-defense," on which we solely rely, is being dragged by those in power in a direction that runs counter to our wishes.

    If it's only for "self-defense," why is it necessary to create enemies? The idea of relying on atomic bombs to earn the glory of France is foolish. It is true that the world is now governed by strength. But even if Japan wants to join that group of strong nations, can it do so? Japan's survival depends on eliminating conflicts with foreign countries and, furthermore, resolving disputes between major powers. Of course, joining hands with the United States is good. But what is the intention behind treating the Soviet Union and China as hypothetical enemy countries? We soldiers will absolutely not pick up guns to participate in wrong wars!

    Mr. Nobusuke Kishi, your past experience has provoked the Soviet Union and China, and even the Japanese people treat you with disdain. Don't you feel this? If you are thinking purely for "self-defense" and are willing to show the innocence of this intention, then you should first apologize to China for Japan's war crimes. There is no other way to dispel distrust of you. We are always ashamed of our faces, and if we are put in an even worse situation because of you, we will not be willing to accept it.

    We also want to make a request to not only conservative politicians, but also those who are called progressive parties. When treating us with a critical eye, please do not forget the following: we, like the working people, are people who suffer from poverty and hardship.

    In any case, we swear: I and our comrades will absolutely not pick up guns to participate in wrong wars! (Excerpted and translated from the "Asahi Shimbun" on April 18)

    誓不为侵略战争开枪
    东京“自卫队”队员  山本一三（二十六岁）
    我们决不是为了走“过去的老路”，而不惜出卖性命拿起枪杆子的。仅仅是由于相信纯粹“自卫手段的必要性”，我才挑选了这个肮脏的职业。但是，看起来，现在我们唯一依据的这个“为了自卫的军队”，正在被当政者拖上同我们的愿望背道而驰的方向。
    如果只是为了“自卫”，干吗有必要树立敌人呢？认为依靠原子弹来挣得法兰西的光荣这种想法，是愚蠢的。不错，现在世界是为实力所左右。但是，日本即使想加入实力那一伙，难道能做得到吗？日本的生存，除了消除同外国的对立，并进而解决大国间的纠纷外，没有别的道路可走。当然，同美国携手是好的。但是，以苏联和中国作为假想敌国，居心何在呢？我们军人，绝对不为参加错误的战争而拿起枪杆子！
    岸信介先生，你过去的经历刺激了苏联和中国，就连日本国民也对你以白眼相待。这一点难道你没有感觉到吗？如果你想的纯粹仅仅是为了“自卫”，并且愿意表明这种意图的清白，那么首先你就应该就日本所犯的战争罪行，向中国谢罪。除此以外，没有别的方法可以消除对你的不信任。本来我们平素就总是感到脸上无光，如果因为你的关系，我们陷于更惨的处境，那我们是不甘心的。
    不仅是保守派的政治家，就是被称为进步政党的人士我们也要对他们提出一个希望。在以批判的眼光对待我们时，请不要忘记下面这句话：我们和劳动人民一样，是受穷受苦的人。
    不论怎样，我们要宣誓：我和我们的同志们绝对不拿起枪杆子来参加错误的战争！　（摘译自4月18日“朝日新闻”）
