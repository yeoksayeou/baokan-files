Xinhua News Agency, 2nd - Joint Statement by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea

The representatives of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (hereinafter referred to as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions), the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (hereinafter referred to as the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan), and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea (hereinafter referred to as the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea), based on the proposal of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the agreement of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, held friendly talks in Beijing on May 1, 1960, on issues such as opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance, supporting the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people, supporting the struggle of the workers of the Miike Coal Mine in Japan, and the national independence struggle of the African people, and issued the following joint statement:

	(I)

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan confirms that the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" signed by U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi group is an aggressive military alliance hostile to the people of China, the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the countries of Asia, and marks the revival of Japanese militarism. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries collude with each other in an attempt to drag the Japanese people into war again through this treaty, to realize the United States' sinister plan of using Asians to fight Asians, and the Japanese reactionaries' ambitions for external expansion.

In order to oppose the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan has united all workers in Japan and all peace-loving democratic forces to carry out fifteen large-scale unified actions, and expressed its firm determination to fight to the end to smash this treaty and to strive for Japan to become an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral country.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan once again emphasizes that it is the U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi group's reactionary policies of hostility towards China, the Soviet Union, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that are obstructing the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and the normalization of relations between Japan and Korea, and obstructing the conclusion of a Japanese-Soviet peace treaty, and resolutely declares that it will continue to unite the workers of Japan and the people of Japan to persist in the struggle to eliminate this obstacle.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea point out that the formation of a military alliance between the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world; the people of China and Korea, who have suffered from the disasters of Japanese imperialist aggression, feel great indignation and resolute opposition to this. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea pay high tribute to the Japanese workers and people who are waging a heroic struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, and believe that this struggle has made a great contribution to the cause of safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea unanimously and firmly declare that they will continue to support the just struggle of the Japanese people, and firmly believe that the Japanese people will overcome all difficulties and obstacles and achieve final victory.

	(II)

The General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea stated: The South Korean people's struggle against the fascist terrorist rule of U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique, disregarding the bloody suppression of the U.S.-Rhee group, is expanding and deepening like a prairie fire, and has already forced Syngman Rhee to announce his resignation, achieving initial victory. The General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea believes that the aggressive troops of U.S. imperialism must be immediately withdrawn from South Korea, the bloody suppression of the U.S.-Rhee group must be immediately stopped, the fascist system of the Syngman Rhee clique must be completely eliminated, the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique must be punished, any foreign interference must be eliminated, and the peaceful reunification of the motherland must be realized by the North and South Korean people themselves.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan stated: The workers and people of China and Japan fully support the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people, and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea's proposition on the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea, the realization of democracy in South Korea, and the realization of the peaceful reunification of Korea by the Korean people themselves; express great indignation and strong condemnation of the bloody massacre by the U.S.-Rhee group; and firmly believe that the heroic South Korean people will continue to struggle until complete victory is achieved. It is unanimously believed that the heroic struggle of the South Korean people is a major event that has shaken the imperialist bloc and inspired the people of the world, and warns all traitorous ruling cliques supported by U.S. imperialism: they will suffer the same fate as Syngman Rhee.

	(III)

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government and monopoly capital's violent suppression and sabotage of the struggle of the workers of the Miike Coal Mine is a persecutory conspiracy by Japanese monopoly capital to promote large-scale layoffs of workers and implement "enterprise rationalization," and is a vicious attack by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries on the workers' movement, which constitutes the biggest obstacle to strengthening the U.S.-Japan "security system." Therefore, the struggle of the workers of the Miike Coal Mine is an important link in the current Japanese workers' movement, and will have a huge impact on the future development of the Japanese workers' movement. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan is determined to mobilize all forces to support the Miike struggle, to fight to the end to smash the conspiracies of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, and to safeguard the vital interests of the workers, and calls on trade unions in Asian and African countries to support it.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea unanimously and severely condemn the fascist atrocities of the Japanese reactionary forces in persecuting workers and murdering worker Kiyoshi Kubo. Express our sincere respect and strong support for the workers of the Miike Coal Mine in Japan who have overcome various difficulties, persisted in the struggle despite the suppression by the Nobusuke Kishi government and monopoly capital. It is believed that with the support of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and all Japanese workers, the Miike struggle will surely achieve final victory.

	(IV)

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea unanimously believe that the raging flames of anti-colonialism and the struggle for national independence that have been ignited everywhere on the African continent in recent years are an extremely important component of the struggle to defend the Asian-African region and world peace. A series of African countries have declared independence, the heroic Algerian people have victoriously persisted in the anti-imperialist armed struggle, and the people of East Africa, Central Africa, and West Africa have risen up to fight for independence; recently, the Africans in the Union of South Africa have launched an extremely heroic large-scale struggle against racial discrimination; all of this has heavily hit the imperialist aggression and colonialist rule.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea unanimously declare: We fully support all struggles of the African people to win and safeguard national independence, further expand and strengthen the international workers' united action to support the Algerian struggle, severely condemn the South African authorities' inhuman bloody massacre of Africans who oppose racial discrimination, and resolutely oppose all armed aggression and deceptive conspiracies by the imperialist groups to maintain colonial rule in Africa. And we firmly believe: Imperialism must be driven out of the African continent, and the African people's just struggle for national liberation must move from victory to new and greater victories.

	(V)

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi is stepping up his plans to forcibly pass the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the Diet, and the struggle has entered a very urgent stage. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan is determined to prevent the ratification of this treaty, and has decided to hold a more massive unified action with the Japanese people from May 10th. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan calls on trade unions in Asian and African countries to carry out unified actions in various forms to give strong support to this major struggle of Japanese workers. And calls for mutual support and joint action for the struggle of the workers of the Miike Coal Mine in Japan, the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people, and the struggle of the South African people against racial discrimination and for national independence.

The All China Federation of Trade Unions and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea expressed their support for this appeal of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and believed that this appeal will definitely receive enthusiastic response from workers and trade union organizations in Asian and African countries.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea unanimously declared: In order to drive U.S. imperialism out of the Western Pacific, in order to completely eliminate the colonialist war forces in the Asian-African region, it is necessary to further strengthen the unity of the working classes of China, Japan, and Korea, and call on trade union organizations and people of Asian and African countries to further unite, support each other in the common struggle, and continue to advance in opposing imperialist aggression, striving for and safeguarding national independence, safeguarding the interests of the working classes of all countries, and defending peace in Asia, Africa, and the world.

    新华社2日讯　中华全国总工会、日本工会总评议会、朝鲜职业总同盟联合声明
    中华全国总工会（简称中国全总）、日本工会总评议会（简称日本总评）和朝鲜职业总同盟（简称朝鲜职总）的代表，基于日本总评的倡议和中国全总、日本总评、朝鲜职总的商定，于1960年5月1日在北京，就反对日美军事同盟、支持南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争、支持日本三池煤矿工人的斗争和非洲人民的民族独立斗争等问题，进行了友好的会谈，并发表联合声明如下：
              （一）
    日本总评确认：美帝国主义和岸信介集团所签订的新日美“安全条约”，是敌视中国、苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国及亚洲各国人民的侵略性的军事同盟，标志着日本军国主义的复活。美日反动派互相勾结，企图通过这一条约，把日本人民再次拖入战争，实现美国的以亚洲人打亚洲人的罪恶计划和日本反动派的对外扩张野心。
    为了反对新日美“安全条约”，日本总评团结日本全体工人，和一切和平民主力量一道，进行了十五次声势浩大的统一行动，并表示坚强的决心，要为粉碎这一条约，为争取日本成为独立、民主、和平、中立的国家奋斗到底。
    日本总评再一次强调指出，阻挠恢复日中邦交和日朝关系正常化、阻挠缔结日苏和约的是美帝国主义和岸信介集团的敌视中国、苏联和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的反动政策，并坚决表示，继续团结日本工人，和日本人民一道，为消除这种阻挠而坚持斗争。
    中国全总和朝鲜职总指出，美日反动派结成军事同盟，严重地威胁着亚洲和世界和平；曾经遭受过日本帝国主义侵略灾害的中国、朝鲜人民对此感到极大愤慨和坚决反对。中国全总和朝鲜职总对正在为反对日美军事同盟，进行着英勇斗争的日本工人和日本人民，致以崇高的敬意；并认为这一斗争对维护亚洲和世界和平事业已经作出了巨大贡献。中国全总和朝鲜职总一致坚决表示，继续支持日本人民的正义斗争，深信日本人民必定排除一切困难和障碍，获得最后胜利。
              （二）
    朝鲜职总表示：南朝鲜人民为了废除美帝国主义和李承晚卖国集团的法西斯恐怖统治所进行的反抗斗争，不顾美李集团的血腥镇压，像燎原烈火一样，正在扩大和深入，已经迫使李承晚不得不宣布下台，取得了初步的胜利。朝鲜职总认为：必须立即使美帝国主义的侵略军队从南朝鲜撤走，立即制止美李集团的血腥镇压，彻底消除李承晚集团法西斯制度，惩办李承晚卖国集团，排除任何外国干涉，由南北朝鲜人民自己实现祖国的和平统一。
    中国全总和日本总评表示：中日两国工人和人民全面支持南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争，和朝鲜职总关于美军立即撤出南朝鲜、在南朝鲜实现民主、由朝鲜人民自己实现朝鲜的和平统一的主张；对美李集团的血腥屠杀表示极大的愤慨和强烈的谴责；坚决相信，英勇的南朝鲜人民必将再接再厉进行斗争，直到取得彻底胜利。一致认为，南朝鲜人民的英勇斗争是一个震撼帝国主义集团、鼓舞全世界人民的重大事件，并警告一切在美帝国主义扶植下的卖国统治集团：他们将遭到和李承晚同样的下场。
              （三）
    日本总评指出，岸信介政府和垄断资本对三池煤矿工人斗争的暴力镇压和破坏活动，是日本垄断资本为推行大规模解雇工人、实行“企业合理化”的一个迫害性阴谋，是美日反动派为了加强日美“安全体制”，对构成其最大阻碍的工人运动所进行的恶毒进攻。因此，三池煤矿工人的斗争是当前日本工人运动的重要一环，对今后日本工人运动的发展，将发生巨大的影响。日本总评决心动员一切力量支援三池斗争，为粉碎美日反动派的阴谋计划，维护工人的切身利益而斗争到底，并呼吁亚非各国工会予以支持。
    中国全总和朝鲜职总一致严厉谴责日本反动势力迫害工人、杀害工人久保清的法西斯暴行。对克服种种困难、不顾岸信介政府和垄断资本的镇压、坚持斗争的日本三池煤矿工人表示衷心的敬意和大力的支持。确信在日本总评和日本全体工人的支援下，三池斗争定将取得最后胜利。
              （四）
    中国全总、日本总评和朝鲜职总一致认为：非洲大陆近年来到处燃起的反殖民主义和争取民族独立的熊熊烈火，是保卫亚非地区与世界和平斗争的异常重要组成部分。一系列非洲国家宣布了独立，英雄的阿尔及利亚人民胜利地坚持着反帝武装斗争，东非、中非和西非人民纷纷起来争取独立；最近南非联邦的非洲人更展开了极其英勇的反对种族歧视的大规模斗争；所有这一切都沉重地打击了帝国主义的侵略和殖民主义的统治。
    中国全总、日本总评和朝鲜职总一致表示：全力支持非洲人民争取与维护民族独立的一切斗争，进一步展开和加强支援阿尔及利亚斗争的国际工人统一行动，严厉谴责南非当局对于反对种族歧视的非洲人的惨无人道的血腥屠杀，坚决反对帝国主义集团为维持非洲的殖民统治所进行的一切武装侵略活动和欺骗阴谋。并深信：帝国主义一定要从非洲大陆被赶出去，非洲人民谋求民族解放的正义斗争一定要从胜利走向新的、更大的胜利。
              （五）
    日本总评指出，岸信介正加紧策划在国会强行通过新日美“安全条约”，斗争已进入十分紧迫的阶段。日本总评决心阻止批准这一条约，并决定和日本人民一道，从5月10日起举行声势更加浩大的统一行动。日本总评呼吁亚非各国工会以各种形式开展统一行动，对日本工人这一重大斗争，给以有力的支持。并呼吁对日本三池煤矿工人的斗争、南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争和南非人民反对种族歧视、争取民族独立的斗争进行相互支援和采取共同行动。
    中国全总和朝鲜职总表示支持日本总评这一呼吁，并相信，这一呼吁一定会得到亚非各国工人与工会组织的热烈响应。
    中国全总、日本总评、朝鲜职总一致表示：为了把美帝国主义驱逐出西太平洋，为了彻底清除亚非地区的殖民主义战争势力，要进一步加强中、日、朝三国工人阶级的团结，并呼吁亚非各国工会组织和人民进一步团结起来，在共同斗争中互相支持，为反对帝国主义侵略，争取和维护民族独立、维护各国工人阶级的利益、保卫亚非和世界和平继续前进。
