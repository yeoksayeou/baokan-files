    The Ninth-Level Storm of People's Revolution
    Cai Yun
    Imperialism is a plague and pestilence. Wherever imperialist aggression forces reach, the people there suffer, and the scourge of exploitation and oppression runs rampant. But this situation has begun to change, and has now turned into a great era in which the exploited and oppressed people awaken and unite to fight back against the imperialist beasts. The people of colonial and semi-colonial countries have set off a worldwide wave of resistance. The anti-imperialist storm stirred up by the most numerous and longest-enslaved and humiliated people of Asia and Africa is particularly magnificent and earth-shattering.
    Our planet is unfolding a great cleaning movement to eliminate all the poisons and filth that capitalist imperialism has brought to mankind, and to wash the entire earth anew. This great sweeping storm is not a sudden "gust of wind" that passes and is gone, but a confluence of wind and clouds at the right time. This is the "era wind" after the shifting of stars. Lenin clearly predicted this era nearly forty years ago:
    "Tomorrow in world history will be the day when the awakened nations oppressed by imperialism will fully awaken, and their long and arduous decisive battle for their own liberation will begin." ("Lenin's Collected Works," Vol. 36, p. 634)
    The oppressed people who have awakened will never again tolerate the humiliation of imperialism, and will never fall asleep again. They will relentlessly pounce on imperialism, completely eliminate it, and will not give up until they have completely achieved their own liberation. These circumstances determine the protracted and arduous nature of the struggle. The storm sweeping across Asia and Africa is in full swing. As Chairman Mao said, the struggle storm of the oppressed people of Asia and Africa against imperialism and its running dogs will rise even greater. This is what we should first recognize.
    Secondly, we must recognize that this is a broad movement, a universal storm. Wherever there is imperialist aggression and oppression, it will inevitably be drawn into this storm. In the past, since capitalism crossed mountains and oceans, and infiltrated all places inhabited by human beings, now the people in these places will inevitably set off waves of opposition to capitalist imperialism. Thinking that some places can be spared, and that some places can use deception and suppression to make the "wind dissipate" is just the wishful thinking of imperialism. This storm is also not a "partial wind" or "isolated wind" of colonial and semi-colonial countries. The national colonial struggle is by no means isolated. It is a part of the world proletarian revolution. The anti-imperialist revolutionary storm will inevitably combine with the proletarian revolutionary struggle storm in the imperialist countries themselves, like an irresistible gale, blowing sand and rocks, and shaking the entire capitalist world.
    Thirdly, mountains cannot block and oceans cannot separate the spread of the revolutionary storm. Comrade Mao Zedong said that the just struggles of the people of all countries in the world support each other. The struggles of the people of South Korea and the people of Turkey will be a support for the just struggles of the people of Africa, the people of Latin America, and the people of the world. Modern life makes the exchanges between people of all countries close. The revolutionary struggle in any place will never disperse without a trace, and will inevitably affect and support each other, uniting the scattered waves into a great storm that sweeps the world.
    Fourthly, the imperialists used violence to seize all backward countries and regions, turning these countries into their colonies and semi-colonies. After the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries awaken, they can only overthrow the rule of imperialism and its running dogs by violence. "One of the most important characteristics of imperialism lies in the fact that it accelerates capitalist development in the most backward countries, thereby expanding and intensifying the struggle against national oppression. That is a fact. From this, it inevitably follows that imperialism often gives rise to national wars." ("Lenin's Collected Works," Vol. 23, p. 74) The people of colonial countries must seek liberation through struggle. National war is the highest form of this struggle. Only through struggle can liberation be achieved. There is no other way. As Comrade. Mao Zedong pointed out, in order to defeat the reactionary rule of imperialism, it is necessary to form a broad united front, unite all forces that do not include the enemy, and continue the arduous struggle.
    Finally, in the final analysis, the targets of the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa and the working people of all countries in the world are all imperialism. The people are setting off a ninth-level storm in order to overthrow imperialism. "To catch bandits, first catch the ringleader." To overthrow imperialism, it is first necessary to overthrow the head of imperialism—U.S. imperialism. Chairman Mao instructed that imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, does not have much life left, because they have done all kinds of bad things, and the oppressed people all over the world will never forgive them.
    The storm in Asia and Africa is a part of the global storm. The storm in Asia and Africa is becoming more and more powerful. It will sweep away the global imperialist plague completely. A large-scale cleaning movement on a world scale has already begun.

    人民革命的九级风暴
    蔡云
    帝国主义是瘟疫和毒疠，帝国主义侵略势力到那里，那里的人民就遭殃，剥削人压迫人的疫疠就残酷地横行。但是这种情况已开始转变了，现在已经转为被剥削被压迫的人民觉醒起来和团结起来向帝国主义野兽反扑的伟大时代了。殖民地半殖民地国家的人民已在全世界掀起反抗的怒潮，亚洲和非洲的为数最多、历时最久的被奴役被污辱的人民所卷起的反帝的风暴，特别气势磅礴，震撼天地。
    我们的行星正展开一次除百害的大扫除运动，要把资本帝国主义带给人类的一切毒害和污秽扫荡干净，把整个地球洗刷一新。这次大扫荡的风暴，并不是突如其来，刮过就完的“一阵风”，而是交了节令，适逢其时的风云际会。这是星移斗转之后的“时代之风”，列宁在近四十年前，就非常明确地预言过这个时代：
    “世界史上的明天，将是这样的一个日子，那时已经被唤醒的、受帝国主义压迫的各民族就要完全苏醒过来，他们争取自己解放的长期的艰苦的决战就要开始了”。（“列宁全集”第36卷634页）
    已经苏醒过来的被压迫的人民，决不会再忍受帝国主义的凌辱，决不会重新沉睡，他们将一刻不停地向帝国主义猛扑，彻底消灭帝国主义，把斗争进行到底，完全取得自身解放之后，才肯罢休。这些情况便决定了斗争的长期性和艰苦性。席卷亚洲和非洲的风暴，正在方兴未艾，正如毛主席所说的，亚非各国受压迫人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴，将会有更大的兴起。这是我们应该首先认识到的。
    其次，我们要认识到这是广泛的运动，普遍的风暴，凡是有帝国主义侵略和压迫的地方，不会不被卷进这个风暴。过去，资本主义既然翻山越岭、渡洋涉海，无孔不入地渗入了一切有人迹的地方，现在，这些地方的人就必然会掀起反对资本帝国主义的风波。以为有些地方可以幸免，有些地方可以用欺骗和镇压的手段使“风流云散”，那不过是帝国主义的单相思罢了。这种风暴也不是殖民地半殖民地的“偏风”和“孤风”，民族殖民地的斗争决不孤立，它是世界无产阶级革命的一部分，反帝的革命风暴必将和帝国主义本国的无产阶级革命斗争的风暴相结合，像不可抵御的狂风，飞沙走石，震撼整个资本主义世界。
    第三，山岳挡不住、海洋隔不开革命风暴的传播。毛泽东同志说，全世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是互相支援的。南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民的斗争，对于非洲人民、拉丁美洲人民以及全世界人民的正义斗争都将是一种支持。现代生活使各国人民交往密切，任何地方的革命斗争决不会毫无痕迹地一哄而散，必然互相影响、互相支持，把各地分散的风潮结成普及全世界的大风暴。
    第四，帝国主义者是用暴力攫取了一切落后的国家和地区，把这些国家变成自己的殖民地和半殖民地。殖民地半殖民地国家的人民觉醒之后，也只有用暴力才能推翻帝国主义及其走狗的统治。“帝国主义最主要的特征之一，正在于它加速最落后的国家里的资本主义发展，从而扩大和加剧反对民族压迫的斗争。这是事实。由此必然得出结论：帝国主义往往要产生民族战争。”（“列宁全集”23卷74页）殖民地人民必须通过斗争才能求得解放，民族战争就是这种斗争的最高形式。只有斗争才能求得解放，没有其他道路。这正如毛泽东同志指出的，为了战胜帝国主义的反动统治，必须结成广泛的统一战线，必须团结不包括敌人在内的一切力量，继续进行艰巨的斗争。
    最后，归根到底，亚非人民以及全世界各国劳动人民的斗争对象都是帝国主义，人民掀起九级风暴，就是为了打倒帝国主义。“擒贼先擒王”，要打倒帝国主义，首先要打倒帝国主义的头子——美帝国主义。毛主席指示说，帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，已经寿命不长，因为他们做尽了坏事，全世界一切受压迫的人民决不会饶恕他们。
    亚非的风暴，是全世界风暴的一部分。亚非的风暴愈来愈有劲有力，它将把全球的帝国主义瘟疫扫得一干二净，一个世界规模的大扫除运动已经开始了。
