People of China, Korea, and Japan, Unite!
By Our Commentator

News has arrived that 200,000 people in Pyongyang held a rally to support the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The angry cries of the Korean people immediately crossed the Sea of Japan and the Yalu River, merging with the voices of the Japanese and Chinese people into a powerful torrent against U.S.-Japanese imperialism.

The people of China, Korea, and Japan, and the people of other Asian countries, have in the past suffered heavy disasters together at the hands of Japanese imperialism and U.S. imperialism. Now, U.S. imperialism still occupies China's territory of Taiwan, occupies half of the land of the Korean people, and tramples on the beautiful land of Japan. The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries are once again colluding, reviving Japanese militarism, and concluding the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, threatening the peace and security of China, Korea, Japan, and other Asian countries. Therefore, the people of China, Korea, and Japan, as well as the people of other Asian countries, are bound to support and assist each other in the common struggle against U.S.-Japanese imperialism. The grand rally of 200,000 people in Pyongyang and yesterday's action of 100,000 people in Tokyo petitioning the Japanese Diet are a great encouragement to the Chinese people and the people of other Asian countries.

People of China, Korea, and Japan, unite! People of the world, unite! Down with U.S. imperialism!

    中朝日人民团结起来
    本报评论员
    消息传来，平壤市二十万人举行大会，声援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争。朝鲜人民发出的愤怒的呼声立即越过日本海和鸭绿江同日本人民的、中国人民的呼声汇合成了一股反对美日帝国主义的强大的洪流。
    中朝日三国人民和亚洲各国人民过去曾经共同遭受过日本帝国主义和美帝国主义的惨重的祸害。现在美帝国主义仍然侵占着中国的领土台湾，侵占着朝鲜人民的半壁江山，践踏着日本美丽的国土。美日反动派又正在勾结起来，复活日本军国主义，缔结日美军事同盟条约，威胁中朝日三国和亚洲各国的和平与安全。因此，中朝日三国人民以及亚洲各国人民在反对美日帝国主义的共同斗争中必然地是互相支持，互相声援的。平壤市二十万人的盛大集会和昨天东京十万人向日本国会请愿斗争的行动，都是对中国人民和亚洲各国人民的极大的鼓舞。
    中朝日三国人民团结起来，全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！
