Xinhua News Agency, May 27th – Following the ban on small-scale business operations by Overseas Chinese in rural areas, powerful factions in Indonesia are now intensifying the implementation of various measures in cities aimed at persecuting and打击 Overseas Chinese.

Returned Overseas Chinese who recently arrived on the "Meishangmei" ship from cities like Bandung, Jakarta, and Karawang revealed that authorities in West Java have promulgated various regulations in the past month or so, restricting the business operations of local Overseas Chinese merchants, subjecting Overseas Chinese to persecution. Cai Yuchun, a returnee from Bandung, said that the discriminatory regulations issued by the authorities in West Java against Overseas Chinese are too numerous to bear. The regulations stipulate that shops operated by Overseas Chinese in cities must register in detail every day the amount of inventory in the shop, its value, how much was sold that day, how much remains, how much cash is on hand, how much profit was made that day, the situation of transactions, and report it to the police station. At the same time, Overseas Chinese merchants must also send their daily invoices and tax bills to the local commerce and tax bureaus for inspection, otherwise they will be deemed to have violated the law, with lighter penalties involving the arrest of the shop owner and prosecution, and heavier penalties involving the sealing of the shop. These cumbersome and harsh restrictions have made it difficult for Overseas Chinese merchants to operate, as they are busy all day registering and reporting to the police, commerce, and tax departments. Under the pressure of these discriminatory measures, they find it increasingly difficult to operate. Huang Yihe, a returnee who operated a rice shop in Tanjung Priok Port for more than 30 years, said that he was forced to close his business and return to the motherland with his entire family because he could not endure these harsh restrictions, cope with these cumbersome regulations, and deal with the harassment from the police.

The Indonesian authorities are also constantly arresting and punishing Overseas Chinese businessmen under the pretext of so-called "raising prices" and "disrupting the economy," arbitrarily confiscating their goods. Qiu Zongchang, a returnee from Jakarta who returned on the "Meishangmei" ship on May 8, said that a friend of his who runs a grocery store had a few rolls of wire in stock. When the economic police came to inspect, they demanded to see the purchase invoice. It could not be found at the time, but was later found and immediately sent to the tax bureau. However, the tax bureau still unreasonably said that he had violated the regulations and detained him.

While persecuting Overseas Chinese businesses in cities, powerful factions in Indonesia are strengthening the persecution of small-scale Overseas Chinese industries in cities. According to returned Overseas Chinese, not long ago, the authorities in Karawang, West Java, had already revoked the business licenses of 115 industrial units operated by Overseas Chinese in the county. The vast majority of these small industrial units produce daily necessities such as soy sauce, ice, tofu, and furniture needed by the local people. In Central Kalimantan, six Overseas Chinese factories were also prohibited from starting operations.

    印度尼西亚加紧迫害城市华侨工商业
    归国华侨揭露：最近一个月颁布了各种各样限制华侨商户营业的条例；西爪哇有关当局歧视华侨的条例多得令人难以忍受；不久以前仅西爪哇加拉旺一个县就收回一百一十五个华侨经营的工业单位的经营执照
    新华社27日讯　印度尼西亚有势力集团继在农村禁止华侨小商经营后，最近正在城市中加紧推行各种旨在迫害和打击华侨的措施。
    最近乘“美上美号”轮船回国的万隆、雅加达、加拉旺等城市的华侨揭露说，西爪哇有关当局最近一个多月来颁布了各种各样限制当地华侨商户营业的条例，对华侨进行迫害。万隆归侨蔡玉春说，西爪哇有关当局颁布的歧视华侨的条例，多得令人难以忍受。条例规定城市华侨经营的商店，每天都要把店内存货多少、价值多少、当天卖出多少、存下多少、又有多少现款、当天盈利多少、买卖情况如何等情况，详细登记，向警察局报告。同时，华侨商户还要将每天的发票和税单送当地商业和税务局查验，否则便作违反法令论处，轻的逮捕店主法办，重的查封店铺，这些繁琐苛刻的限制，使得华侨商户整天忙于到警察、商业、税务等部门去登记和报告。他们在这些歧视性措施的压力下，经营日感困难。在丹绒不碌港经营米店三十多年的归侨黄义和说，他就是因为无法忍受这种苛刻的限制，应付不了这些繁琐的条例和警察的骚扰，不得不被迫歇业，全家返回祖国。
    印度尼西亚有关当局还不断以所谓“抬高物价”、“扰乱经济”的罪名逮捕和处罚华侨商人，任意没收华侨的货物。5月8日乘“美上美号”轮船回国的雅加达归侨丘宗昌说，他有个朋友是开杂货店的，店内存有几卷铁丝，经济警察来店检查时，要索看进货发票，当时没有找到，虽然后来找到了，马上把发票送到税务局，但税务局仍无理地说他违反规定，把他拘留起来了。
    印度尼西亚有势力集团在迫害城市华侨商业的同时，正在加强对城市华侨小工业的迫害。据归国的华侨揭露，不久前，西爪哇加拉旺有关当局已经收回这个县一百一十五个华侨经营的工业单位的经营执照，这些小工业单位绝大部分是生产为当地人民日常所需要的酱油、冰、豆腐、家具等生活用品的。中加里曼丹也有六家华侨工厂被禁止开工。
