    Not Relaxing for a Step, Not Loosening for a Moment, Grasping to the End
    Spring Ploughing and Sowing Movement Reaches Climax – Tide upon Tide
    Six Levels of Cadres from Shanxi, Jilin, and Fujian Meet in the Fields
    To Carry Out Large-Scale Inspections and Evaluations to Promote Current Production
    (Reported by this newspaper) In Shanxi Province, cadres from six levels, from the province to the grassroots, met in the fields to launch a mass large-scale inspection, evaluation, and promotion, powerfully promoting the current agricultural production.
    This spring, after continuous struggle against drought in Shanxi Province, the overall rural production situation is very good. The area irrigated in spring has expanded more than threefold compared to the same period last year; over 18 million mu of high-yield squares, ridges, and ditches have been established; and the province is vigorously carrying out a land-saving movement, which can expand cultivated land by about 5 million mu. According to preliminary statistics, an average of nearly 110 dan of base fertilizer is applied per mu of cultivated land in the province, of which high-quality fertilizer accounts for half, both the quantity and quality of which greatly exceed those of previous years.
    This inspection and evaluation, centered on the fight against drought, is a comprehensive review and promotion of spring production. The content of inspection and evaluation varies according to the specific conditions of each region. Jinan Prefecture, where the drought is increasingly serious, is making every effort to inspect and promote the mass movement to fight drought and protect seedlings. Jinbei Prefecture focuses on inspecting and promoting "five expansions," namely, expanding cultivated land area, expanding high-yield crops, expanding close planting area, expanding intercropping, and expanding improved seed area. The Taihang Mountains and Jin Southeast Prefecture focus on inspecting "five barriers," namely, the fertilizer barrier, the careful and meticulous cultivation barrier, the cultivated land area barrier, the planting plan and planting quality barrier.
    The six levels of cadres conducting inspection and evaluation activities in the fields have greatly promoted the current production movement. PingShun County, through in-depth inspection, has summarized a set of "three grasps and one acceptance" methods: grasping both inside and outside the square, grasping both cultivated and non-cultivated land, grasping both large and small autumn crops, and an agricultural work acceptance system. After this leadership method was promoted throughout the county, the current production quickly showed a situation of comprehensive development and comprehensive improvement. After the cotton field planting was basically completed in Linyi County, a comprehensive survey and key sampling inspection were conducted by commune, revealing that 5% of the area was planted with low quality and had omissions. Therefore, a shock team was immediately organized to carry out a shock cotton field finishing work.
    Up to now, Shanxi Province, under severe drought conditions, has planted 17 million mu in the spring, exceeding the same period of previous years by more than 5 million mu, and the quality has improved; in wheat field management, due to continuous inspection, continuous ranking, and classified processing in various places, this year has broken the previous pattern of more second-class and third-class wheat fields and fewer first-class wheat fields, and has changed to more first-class wheat fields and fewer second-class and third-class wheat fields.
    (Reported by this newspaper) Jilin Province's six-level cadres meet in the fields to fully promote spring ploughing and sowing.
    Starting in early April, cadres from the province, region, county, commune, management district, and production team carried their luggage and tools and went to the front lines of production. They lived in commune members' homes, ate in public canteens, worked in production teams, and labored in the fields. This large army of more than 127,000 cadres is a work team, as well as a production team; an inspection team, as well as a propaganda team; both commanders and fighters, as well as technicians. Most communes in Yushu, Dehui and other counties implemented field offices, adhering to the fine style of meeting in the fields, propaganda in the fields, inspection in the fields, and learning in the fields. Li Diping, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, in Qian'an County, where there are many sandstorms, worked with grassroots cadres and commune members and found that the local people did not pay attention to conserving moisture when sowing, and the soil moisture in some land was not good due to wind and sun exposure. He helped the local Party committee research and formulate moisture conservation measures such as flat sowing before ridge planting and planting highland before planting lowland, which quickly set off a climax of moisture conservation and sowing in the county. Yu Yifu, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, in Yongji County, joined 8,000 cadres from the county in going to the fields to work alongside the grassroots cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers to study and formulate spring ploughing and sowing technical operating procedures. A high-speed and high-standard sowing movement was launched throughout the county. The number of people participating in sowing increased sharply by two and a half times, and the daily sowing progress increased by two times.
    This year, the number of cadres planting experimental fields in various places in Jilin Province increased by 30% compared with last year, the area of experimental fields expanded four times, and the forms are diverse, the content is rich, and the role is significant. The combination of cadres, technicians, and commune members is closer.
    This year, all parts of Jilin resolutely implemented the policy of "taking grain and beans as the key, forestry and animal husbandry as the focus, and comprehensively developing a variety of rural economies." The province's grain and bean crop area increased by 20% compared with last year, and the area of ginseng and other economic crops also increased. The province expanded the sowing area of cultivated land by 1.99 million mu, of which grain crops increased by 1.2 million mu, and economic crops increased by more than 15%. The proportion of various high-yield fields in the total sowing area has also greatly increased compared with last year. Most of the more than 22 million mu of farmland that has been sown so far meets the standards.
    Due to the leading role of cadres in production, the current rural labor attendance rate is above 95%; the province's task of reclaiming wasteland has been overfulfilled by 33%; since the beginning of this year, pig breeding has increased by more than 25%, the conception rate of large livestock has increased by more than 69%, and poultry has increased by more than 66%.
    (Reported by this newspaper) Six levels of cadres from Fujian Province met in the fields, mobilizing the masses to vigorously grasp more, early, dense, good, as well as agricultural technical innovation and technical revolution, so that spring planting and field management have shown continuous leap forward, and a good situation of high tides following high tides.
    Early rice, major oil crops (peanuts, soybeans), and other industrial raw material crops in Fujian are mostly sown in spring and harvested in summer. According to past practical experience, the provincial party committee and party committees at all levels put forward the combat slogan of seizing more, seizing early, seizing density, and seizing quality, and tightly grasping the good situation of spring production, without relaxing a step or a moment, grasping the whole process to the end. As of the beginning of May, in more than a month of busy spring planting, the province has transplanted more than 8.38 million mu of early rice, and the transplanting progress is faster than in any previous year. Industrial raw material crops are also planted more and better than in any previous year. The spring planting of peanuts alone is close to the total peanut planting area of the whole year last year. The planting area of ​​sugar cane and flue-cured tobacco has increased by 30% and nearly twice respectively compared with last year. At present, spring planting continues.
    At present, on the basis of approaching the completion of the spring planting plan, in addition to striving to overfulfill the expansion plan and plant more and more, the province is further organizing forces to shift the main attack direction to the field management movement centered on accumulating and topdressing fertilizer, and weeding and hoeing, and vigorously carrying out a large-area high-yield movement.

    一步不放　一刻不松　一抓到底
    春耕播种运动高潮  紧接高潮
    山西吉林福建六级干部会师田间
    开展大检查大评比推动当前生产
    本报讯　山西省从省到基层六级干部田间会师，展开群众性的大检查、大评比、大促进，有力地推动当前农业生产。
    今年春季，山西省经过持续的抗旱防旱斗争，整个农村生产形势非常好。春浇面积比去年同期扩大了三倍多；建立丰产方、梁、沟一千八百多万亩；全省大力开展节约用地运动，可扩大耕地面积五百万亩左右。据初步统计，全省平均每亩耕地施底肥近一百一十担，其中优质肥料占到一半，数量和质量都大大超过了往年。
    这次检查评比以抗旱防旱为中心，是一次春季生产全面大检阅大促进。各地根据当地具体情况，检查评比内容各有特点。旱象日益严重的晋南专区，全力检查推动全民抗旱保苗运动。晋北专区重点检查“五扩大”，即扩大耕地面积、扩大高产作物、扩大密植面积、扩大间作、扩大优种面积。太行山晋东南专区是中心检查“五道关”，即肥料关、精耕细作关、耕地面积关、播种计划和播种质量关。
    六级干部深入田间展开检查评比活动，对当前生产运动起了巨大的促进作用。平顺县通过深入检查，总结出一套“三抓一验收”的办法：即方里方外一齐抓、耕地非耕地一齐抓、大秋小秋一齐抓，以及农活验收制度。这个领导方法在全县推广以后，使当前生产很快出现了全面发展全面好的局面。临猗县在棉田播种基本结束之后，以公社为单位逐片普查和重点抽查，发现有5％的面积种的质量不高和有漏地现象，于是马上组织突击队伍突击棉田扫尾工作。
    到目前为止，山西省在严重干旱的情况下，全省春种面积已达一千七百万亩，超过往年同期五百多万亩，而且质量提高；在麦田管理上，由于各地不断检查，不断排队，分类加工，今年打破了已往二类、三类麦田多，一类麦田少的规律，一变而为一类麦田多，二类、三类麦田少。
    本报讯　吉林省六级干部会师田间，全力促进春耕播种。
    从4月上旬开始，省、地、县、公社、管理区、生产队干部背着行李、携带工具，纷纷走上生产前线。他们住在社员家、吃在公共食堂，工作在生产队，劳动在田间。这支十二万七千多人组成的干部大军是工作队，也是生产队；是检查团，也是宣传团；既是指挥员、战斗员，又是技术员。榆树、德惠等县大部分公社实行了田间办公，坚持会议到田、宣传到田、检查到田、学习到田的优良作风。省委书记处书记李砥平在多风沙的乾安县，同基层干部和社员一起劳动，发现当地群众播种时没注意保墒，部分土地因风吹日晒，墒情不好，便帮助当地党委研究出先平播后起垅、先种岗地后种洼地等保墒措施，使全县迅速掀起保墒播种高潮。省委书记处书记于毅夫在永吉县会同全县八千名干部深入田间，跟班劳动，亲自同基层干部、技术员、老农研究制定出春耕播种技术操作规程，全县掀起了高速度高标准播种运动，参加播种的人数猛增两倍半，播种日进度提高两倍。
    今年，各级干部种试验田人数比去年增加30％，试验田的面积扩大四倍，而且形式多样，内容丰富，作用显著，干部、技术员、社员结合的更加密切。
    今年吉林各地坚决贯彻实行“以粮豆为纲，以林牧为重点，全面发展农村多种经济”的方针，全省粮豆作物面积比去年增加20％，人参和其它经济作物面积也有增加。全省扩大播种耕地面积达一百九十九万亩，其中粮食作物增加一百二十万亩，经济作物增加15％以上。各种高产田在总播种面积中的比重也比去年大大增加。目前已播种的二千二百多万亩农田，绝大部分都合乎标准。
    由于干部带头生产，目前农村劳动出勤率达95％以上；全省开荒任务已超额33％完成；今年以来养猪增长25％强，大家畜配种妊娠率增长69％强，家禽增长66％强。
    本报讯　福建省六级干部会师田间，发动群众大抓多、早、密、好以及农业技术革新和技术革命，使春种和田间管理出现了连续跃进，高潮紧接高潮的大好形势。
    福建的早稻、主要油料（花生、大豆）和其他工业原料作物大多在春季播种，夏季收获。省委和各级党委根据以往的实践经验，提出抓多、抓早、抓密、抓好的战斗口号，紧紧抓住春季生产的大好形势，一步不放、一刻不松地一竿抓到底。到5月初止，在一个多月的春种大忙中，全省已插早稻八百三十八万多亩，插秧进度比以往任何一年都快。工业原料作物也比以往任何一年种得多、种得好。仅春种花生就已接近去年全年花生种植面积的总和。甘蔗、烤烟等种植面积已分别比去年扩大30％和近二倍。现在，春种仍继续进行。
    目前，全省在接近完成春种计划的基础上，除力争超额完成扩种计划，多种再多种以外，正在进一步组织力量，把主攻方向转向以积肥追肥中耕除草等为中心的田间管理运动，和大搞大面积丰产运动。
