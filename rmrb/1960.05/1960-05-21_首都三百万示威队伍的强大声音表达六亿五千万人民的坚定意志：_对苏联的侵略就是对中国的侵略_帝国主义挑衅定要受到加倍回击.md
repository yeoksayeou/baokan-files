Xinhua News Agency, May 20th: (By our correspondent) The heart of our great motherland, Beijing, reverberated today with a roar of anger. Over 3.2 million people from all walks of life held an unprecedented city-wide demonstration and rally, resolutely supporting the Soviet government's solemn stance against the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism, and resolutely opposing U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference.

U.S. imperialism, defying the world's condemnation, dared to send aircraft to invade and provoke our great ally, the Soviet Union, arousing such intense anger among the people of Beijing. Demonstrations and rallies gathered in almost every corner of the city. In Tiananmen Square, the central venue, and on East and West Chang'an Avenue, over 1.2 million people formed a sea of humanity, their angry slogans shaking the heavens. In the suburbs, countless factories, schools, institutions, military units, and towns, totaling over 2 million people, also held demonstrations and rallies at the same time.

With uncontainable anger, over 3 million people shouted at the top of their voices: "Resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocations against the Soviet Union!" "Resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference!" The entire city of Beijing reverberated with angry roars. Deng Xiaoping, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, stated firmly and forcefully at the million-person rally: "U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocations against the Soviet Union are aggression and provocations against the People's Republic of China, and against the entire socialist camp." He warned imperialism: "Every provocation against socialist countries and the cause of world peace must be met with doubled retaliation." These voices from Beijing, transmitted by radio broadcasts, traveled to the farthest reaches of the motherland. These voices expressed the firm will of 650 million Chinese people.

At 3:00 PM, the million-person rally in Tiananmen Square began. In the vast square, people from all walks of life were arranged in neat formations. Particularly eye-catching was the fully armed militia contingent in the front of the square. In the hands of some militiamen, they gripped brand-new submachine guns. Many banners of "Militia Divisions" and "Militia Regiments" were held high in front of the队伍, fluttering in the wind. Standing closely behind the militia队伍 were the troops of the army, navy, and air force without weapons. Today, marshals and many generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army also stood on the Tiananmen gate tower to participate in the rally. The powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army—the defender of the motherland and the guardian of world peace—received great respect from the people.

In front of the square, there were also 队伍 of workers and students, including groups of steelworkers and coal miners who had traveled from afar to participate in the rally today. At the same time, employees of various factories and enterprises also generally held rallies at their production sites. More than 30,000 producers and builders of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company held rallies today beside blast furnaces, converters, construction sites, and other production locations. Over 6,000 workers from the Changxindian Railway Factory, like the people in the city, held large slogan banners and large-scale cartoons, holding rallies and parades in the factory and on the streets.

Young students expressed great indignation at the aggression and provocations against the Soviet Union, their elder brother. As they marched along the streets, they conducted propaganda along the way. In their队伍, some, dressed as Eisenhower wearing a top hat, were spat upon by the demonstrating masses. On some huge cartoon boards, people used large characters to indicate: "Eisenhower is not a 'messenger of peace,' but the number one war monger." Before the rally began, many theatrical troupes composed of university students, with various artistic programs they had arranged overnight opposing U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocations and supporting the Soviet Union's just stance, performed everywhere in the square.

Old Red Army soldiers who participated in the October Revolution, members of the China-Soviet Friendship People's Commune, and doctors and nurses of the China-Soviet Friendship Hospital, who had special brotherly feelings with the Soviet people, today expressed their firm support for the Soviet Union's solemn stance and denounced the U.S. imperialism's crimes of aggression against the Soviet Union. Ji Shoushan, the director of the expert office of the National Bureau of Metrology, was an old Red Army soldier who participated in the October Revolution, the Soviet Civil War, and the Great Patriotic War in his early years, and engaged in the great socialist construction with the Soviet people, living in the Soviet Union for thirty-nine years before returning to China in 1954. Today, he said to the people around him in Tiananmen Square: "When I heard that U.S. imperialism sent spy planes to invade my second hometown—the Soviet Union—I felt particularly angry. Soviet territory must not be violated." He kept shouting: "Oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocations against the Soviet Union!"

In the Shijingshan area, where the China-Soviet Friendship People's Commune is located, nearly 100,000 people held rallies and parades. Commune members who have close friendships with Soviet farmers arrived at the venue early today. The militia here warned U.S. imperialism that if they dare to invade the Chinese people's dear brothers, they should try the weapons in the hands of the Chinese militia. In the commune's various production teams, villages, and families, men and women, old and young, were listening to the live broadcast of the Tiananmen rally. In the commune's home for the elderly, the elders enjoying their twilight years watched the live broadcast of the Tiananmen rally on television. These older generation farmers who had suffered greatly from the exploitation and oppression of imperialism and reactionaries knew the true face of imperialism best. Cui Dengxi, an old hired laborer who had been a long-term worker for thirty-one years, put it bluntly, comparing imperialism to landlords, all with smiling faces and black hearts. He said: Today the smiling face of imperialism has been torn off.

The China-Soviet Friendship Hospital, except for those on duty, all four hundred doctors and nurses participated in the demonstrations and rallies today. The hundreds of patients in the hospital expressed great indignation at U.S. imperialism's aggression against the Soviet Union. Ninety-five patients jointly wrote a letter to the rally today, severely condemning the U.S. imperialism's crime of using spy planes to invade the Soviet Union.

This morning, Chinese and Soviet crew members who had just arrived in Beijing from Moscow held a forum after listening to the broadcast in their apartments. They unanimously stated: The rock-solid unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is a powerful weapon to smash imperialist aggression and a reliable guarantee for safeguarding world peace.

The participants in the demonstration were so widespread. Around the tall Monument to the People's Heroes in the south of Tiananmen Square and on the steps, thousands upon thousands of street women from the urban people's communes gathered. Some white-haired elderly women, together with the youths, shouted angrily: "Oppose American aggression against the Soviet Union!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" The cleaning workers, who were looked down upon in the old society, today joined the parade in front of Tiananmen in队伍. All the workers of the Beijing Second Cleaning Team unanimously stated: "If U.S. imperialism dares to launch a war, we will, like clearing粪便, load them onto garbage trucks and send them to garbage pits." Some of the workers at Zhengda Paint Factory, having just finished their shift and without even eating, came to participate in the rally in their work clothes. They said that Eisenhower's talk of peace is like painting a rotten piece of wood. No matter how well it is painted, it is still rotten inside. A few months ago, Eisenhower put on a layer of "peace paint" to deceive people, but now he has scraped the "paint" off himself. Thousands of representatives from all over the country participating in the technical innovation and technical revolution performance conference of the finance and trade departments denounced the crimes of U.S. imperialism together with the people of the capital. They said that the eight million employees of the finance and trade departments across the country are not only fighters for economic construction and technical revolution, but also fighters against U.S. imperialist aggression. More than 300 representatives of blind and deaf-mute people who are participating in the first National Congress of Blind and Deaf-Mute People in Beijing also gathered today to angrily condemn U.S. imperialism. And passed a telegram supporting the Soviet Union's solemn stance and opposing U.S. imperialism's aggression against the Soviet Union and sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference.

The boiling city of Beijing, the footprints of the demonstrating masses covered all the corners. From the foot of Yanshan Mountain to the banks of the Yongding River, the entire suburbs were full of angry crowds. Tens of thousands of wired broadcast loudspeakers distributed in every corner of the suburbs broadcast the angry voices of the million-strong masses in front of Tiananmen to towns, villages, fields, and workshops. The commune members who were busy managing wheat fields and harvesting vegetables put down their hoes and gathered to denounce U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocations. In Tongxian and Shunyi two county towns, more than 30,000 people held demonstrations. The 80,000 migrant workers who are busy building the Miyun Reservoir held a protest rally in front of the towering dam. In the remote Zaitang People's Commune in the deep mountainous area of western Beijing, many female commune members, holding their children, specially rushed from nearby mountain villages to the central location to participate in the demonstration.

Even the passengers passing through Beijing expressed their indignation. In the newly built Beijing Railway Station, more than 1,000 passengers from Shanghai, Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan and other provinces and cities gathered in various waiting rooms. They wrote a letter on the spot, protesting U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference and supporting the Soviet Union's just stance.

Today, guests from many countries in Beijing were invited to participate in the mass rally in front of Tiananmen. They, together with the people of the capital, opposed U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference and supported the Soviet Union's just stance. Major William Gálvez, the heroic Cuban representative and general inspector of the Cuban army, who stood at the forefront of Latin America's opposition to U.S. imperialism, severely condemned the U.S. imperialism's aircraft invading Soviet airspace. He said that this is an act of robbery. Today's American government is a robber government that quibbles for acts of robbery. The major said that the Cuban people have been deeply affected by the aggression of U.S. imperialism, and now the American government is still using its aircraft to bomb our cities. We, the Cuban people, severely condemn the war policy of the American government.

Hatanaka Masaharu, Standing Director of the Japan Peace Committee, said excitedly that the Chinese people's expression of support for the Soviet people today will also be a great encouragement to the Japanese people's just struggle. He believes that U.S. imperialism's sneak attack on Soviet airspace with spy planes, sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference, and the Kishi Nobusuke clique's forced passage of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty are a series of destructive actions by U.S. imperialism with consistency. Hatanaka Masaharu emphasized that the forced passage of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" does not mean that the Japanese people's struggle has ended, but on the contrary, the beginning of a new struggle.

Jack Goumoh, a friend from Cameroon, where the anti-colonial movement is surging, and a member of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions, said that today's grand rally proves the Chinese people's desire for peace. He said that as an African people, I feel that this is one of the proofs of the great strength of the socialist camp. He also said that the Soviet government's position is completely correct. Because one cannot sit at a table and negotiate with a person who is holding a sign of peace in one hand and punching peace in the back with the other.

Razafinjatovo, the head of the Madagascar trade union delegation, said that U.S. imperialism's invasion of Soviet airspace exposes its true face of aggression. U.S. imperialism used to disguise peace, but now the facts prove that it wants war. I believe that the people of Madagascar will also support the just position of the Soviet people, like the Chinese people who stand at the forefront of the struggle for peace.

Lukas Werner, the head of the German trade union delegation, and Margot Honecker, the head of the educational delegation of the German Democratic Republic, unanimously stated that the great rally of the working people of Beijing shows the Chinese people's will and determination to defend world peace and oppose U.S. imperialism, and this rally is also a support for the German people's maintenance of European peace. Margot Honecker condemned that U.S. imperialism armed West German militarism, turning West Germany into a base of aggression and a source of war, which seriously threatens European and world peace.

Báras Celestino Portugal Linarco, the head of the Chilean Workers' United Trade Union delegation, said that he wants to tell the people of Latin American countries: How socialist countries are united to oppose the barbaric U.S. imperialism and support the struggles of other countries. He said: In Latin America, the working people have formed a broad united front to fight for liberation from the enslavement of U.S. imperialism.

Today's unprecedented rally and demonstration in Beijing shows that the people of China and the Soviet Union, the people of socialist countries, and peace-loving people all over the world are closely united together. This great force for defending world peace will never be defeated.

    首都三百万示威队伍的强大声音表达六亿五千万人民的坚定意志：
    对苏联的侵略就是对中国的侵略
    帝国主义挑衅定要受到加倍回击
    据新华社20日讯　本社记者报道：伟大祖国的心脏——北京，今天震荡着一片愤怒的吼声。各界人民三百二十多万人举行了历史上空前规模的倾城大示威和集会，坚决支持苏联政府对美帝国主义侵略罪行的严正立场，坚决反对美帝国主义破坏四大国首脑会议。
    美帝国主义竟然甘冒天下之大不韪，派遣飞机对我国伟大的盟邦苏联进行侵略和挑衅，激起了北京人民如此激烈的愤怒情绪。全市各个角落几乎到处都结起了示威和集会的人群。在作为中心会场的天安门广场和东西长安大街上，一百二十多万人汇成了海浪般的人潮，愤怒的口号声震天动地。郊区无数的工厂、学校、机关、部队和城镇，共有二百多万人也在同一时间分别举行了示威和集会。
    三百多万人以不可遏止的愤怒心情，引吭高呼：“坚决反对美帝国主义对苏联的侵略和挑衅！”“坚决反对美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议！”整个北京，都震荡着愤怒的吼声。中共中央总书记邓小平在百万人的大会上坚强有力地表示：“美帝国主义对苏联的侵略和挑衅，就是对中华人民共和国的侵略和挑衅，就是对整个社会主义阵营的侵略和挑衅”。他警告帝国主义：“对社会主义国家和世界和平事业的每一次挑衅，都一定要受到加倍的回击”。北京发出的这些声音，从无线电广播中遥传到祖国的最远方。这声音表达了六亿五千万中国人民的坚强意志。
    下午三时，天安门广场百万人的大会开始。在巨大的广场上，各界人民排列成严整的队伍。特别引人注目的是广场前面全副武装的民兵队伍，在一些民兵队员的手里，紧握着崭新的冲锋枪。许多“民兵师”、“民兵团”的大旗，高举在队伍前面随风飘舞。紧站在民兵队伍后面的是没有携带武器的陆海空三军官兵的队伍。在今天，还有中国人民解放军的元帅和许多将军们，也站在天安门城楼上参加了大会。强大的中国人民解放军——祖国的捍卫者、世界和平的保卫者——他们受到了人们极大的尊敬。
    在广场的前面，还站满了工人和学生的队伍，其中有成群的钢铁工人和煤矿工人，他们今天远道赶来参加大会。在此同时，各工厂企业的职工还普遍在生产现场举行了集会。石景山钢铁公司的三万多名生产者和建设者，今天分别在高炉、转炉旁和建设工地及其他生产现场举行了集会。长辛店铁路工厂六千多工人，今天和城内人民一样，高举着大型标语牌和大型漫画，在工厂、街头举行了集会游行。
    青年学生们对于苏联老大哥受到美帝国主义的侵略和挑衅，表示极大的义愤。他们从大街上一路走来的时候，就沿途进行宣传。在他们的队伍里，一些化妆成戴着高筒绅士帽的艾森豪威尔，到处受到了示威群众的唾弃。在一些巨幅的漫画牌上，人们用大字标明：“艾森豪威尔不是‘和平的使者’，而是头号的战争贩子”。大会开始以前，广场上由大学生们组成的许多化装演出队，带着他们连夜编排的反对美帝国主义侵略和挑衅支援苏联正义立场的各种文艺节目，到处流动演出。
    同苏联人民特别有着兄弟情谊的当年参加过十月革命的老红军战士，中苏友好人民公社的社员们，中苏友谊医院的医生和护士们，今天都表示坚决支持苏联的严正立场，痛斥美帝国主义对苏联的侵略罪行。国家计量局专家室主任季寿山老人，早年曾经是参加过十月革命、苏联国内战争和卫国战争的老红军，同苏联人民一起进行了伟大的社会主义建设，在苏联生活了三十九年，1954年才回国的。今天他在天安门广场对周围的人说：“当我听到美帝国主义派遣间谍飞机侵入我的第二个故乡——苏联的时候，我感到特别愤怒，苏联的领土绝不允许侵犯。”他不停地高呼：“反对美帝国主义对苏联的侵略和挑衅！”
    在中苏友好人民公社所在的石景山地区，近十万群众分别举行了集会游行。和苏联农民有着亲密友谊的公社社员们，今天一早就赶到会场。这里的民兵警告美帝国主义说，如果胆敢侵犯中国人民的亲兄弟，就要请他们试试中国民兵手中的武器。在这个公社的各个生产队、村庄和家庭里，男女老少都在收听天安门大会的实况广播。在公社的敬老院里，安度晚年的老人们围在电视机旁看天安门大会的实况。这些饱受帝国主义和反动派盘剥欺压的老一代农民们，最了解帝国主义的真面目，曾经当过三十一年长工的老雇工崔登喜一语道破，他把帝国主义比作地主，全都是脸笑心黑。他说：今天帝国主义的笑脸被撕掉了。
    中苏友谊医院今天除了值班的以外，四百多名医生护士全部参加了示威和集会。在这个医院的几百名病员，对美帝国主义侵略苏联表示非常气愤。九十五名病员今天联名写信给大会，严厉谴责美帝国主义使用间谍飞机侵略苏联的罪行。
    今天上午，刚刚从莫斯科抵达北京的中国和苏联乘务员，在公寓里收听广播后举行了座谈会。他们一致表示：中苏两国人民坚如盘石的团结，是粉碎帝国主义侵略的有力武器，是维护世界和平的可靠保证。
    参加示威的群众是这样的广泛。在天安门广场南面高大的革命英雄纪念碑的周围和台阶上，聚集了成千成万的来自城市人民公社的街道妇女，一些白发苍苍的老年妇女们，同青年们一起愤怒地高呼：“反对美国侵略苏联！”“打倒美帝国主义！”旧社会被人瞧不起的“挑大粪的”清洁工人，今天结队参加了天安门前的游行队伍。北京市第二清洁队全体工人一致表示：“如果美帝国主义胆敢发动战争，我们就要像清除粪便一样，把他装到垃圾车上，送到垃圾坑里去。”正大喷漆厂的工人们，有的刚下班没顾上吃饭，便穿着工作服来参加大会，他们说，艾森豪威尔谈和平，就像向一块朽木头上涂漆一样，无论涂的怎样好看，但里面还是腐朽的。前几个月，艾森豪威尔涂上了一层“和平漆”，想遮人耳目，现在他自己把“漆”刮掉了。来自全国各地参加财贸部门技术革新和技术革命表演大会的几千名代表，和首都人民一起怒斥美帝国主义的罪行。他们说，全国八百万财贸部门的职工，不光是经济建设和技术革命的战士，也是反对美帝国主义侵略的战士。正在北京参加第一届全国盲人聋哑人代表会议的三百多名盲人聋哑人代表，今天也集会愤怒地谴责美帝国主义。并且通过了一个通电，支持苏联严正立场，反对美帝国主义侵略苏联、破坏四国首脑会议。
    沸腾的北京城，示威群众的脚印踏遍了所有的角落。从燕山脚下到永定河畔，整个郊区到处是愤怒的人群。分布在郊区各个角落的几万只有线广播喇叭，把天安门前百万群众的愤怒呼声，传遍了城镇、乡村、田头、车间。正在忙着管理麦田、收获蔬菜的社员们放下了锄头铣镐，集会声讨美帝国主义的侵略和挑衅。在通县和顺义两个县城，有三万多人举行了示威游行。正在紧张修建密云水库的八万民工在矗立的大坝前举行了抗议集会。北京西部深山区偏僻的斋堂人民公社，很多女社员抱着小孩，特地从附近山村赶到中心地点参加示威游行。
    甚至那些过往北京的旅客，也都表示了他们的义愤。在新建的北京车站里，来自上海、广东、湖北、湖南等省市的一千多名旅客，分散在各个候车室里集会。他们当场写了一封信，抗议美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议，支持苏联的正义立场。
    今天，在北京的许多国家的来宾都应邀参加了天安门前的群众集会。他们和首都人民一起，反对美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议，支持苏联的正义立场。站在拉丁美洲反对美帝国主义最前哨的英雄的古巴代表、古巴军队总督察威廉·加尔维斯少校严厉谴责美帝国主义飞机侵入苏联领空，他说，这是一种强盗行为。今天的美国政府是一个为强盗行为诡辩的强盗政府。这位少校说，古巴人民深受美帝国主义的侵略，现在美国政府还用它的飞机轰炸我们的城市，我们古巴人民严厉谴责美国政府的战争政策。
    日本和平委员会常任理事畑中政春激动地说，中国人民今天不仅表示了对苏联人民的支持，也将是对日本人民正义斗争很大的鼓舞。他认为，美帝国主义用间谍飞机偷袭苏联领空、破坏四国首脑会议、岸信介集团强行通过日美军事同盟条约，这是美帝国主义具有连贯性的一系列的破坏行动。畑中政春强调说，强行通过新日美“安全条约”，并不意味着日本人民的斗争已经结束，相反的是新的斗争的开始。
    来自反殖民主义运动高涨的喀麦隆朋友——世界工会联合会执委会委员杰克·高姆说，今天这个盛大的集会，证明了中国人民热爱和平的愿望。他说，作为一个非洲人民，我感到这是社会主义阵营巨大力量的证明之一。他还说，苏联政府的立场完全是正确的。因为一个人不可能与一只手打着和平的招牌，而另一只手却从背后给和平打一拳头的人，坐在一张桌子上进行谈判。
    马达加斯加工会代表团团长拉扎拉札加说，美帝国主义侵犯苏联领空，这暴露了它侵略的真面目。美帝国主义过去伪装和平，现在事实证明他是要战争。我相信马达加斯加人民也会像站在争取和平前列的中国人民一样，支持苏联人民的正义立场。
    德国工会代表团团长鲁卡斯·维尔纳和德意志民主共和国教育代表团团长马戈特·霍内克一致表示：北京劳动人民的巨大集会显示了中国人民保卫世界和平，反对美帝国主义的意志和决心，这个集会同时也是对德国人民维护欧洲和平的支持。马戈特·霍内克谴责说，美帝国主义武装了西德军国主义，把西德变成为侵略基地和战争策源地，严重地威胁了欧洲和世界和平。
    智利工人统一工会代表团团长巴拉斯·塞莱斯蒂诺·波尔图加耳·利纳尔科说，他要告诉拉丁美洲国家的人民：在社会主义国家是如何团结一致，来反对横蛮无理的美帝国主义，和支持其他国家人民的斗争的。他说：在拉丁美洲，劳动人民已经结成广泛的统一战线，为从美帝国主义的奴役下解放出来而进行斗争。
    今天北京空前规模的集会和示威，表明了中苏两国人民、社会主义各国人民、全世界爱好和平的人民，紧紧地团结在一起，这种伟大的保卫世界和平的力量，是永远也不可战胜的。
