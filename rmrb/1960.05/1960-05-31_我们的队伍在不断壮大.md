    Our Ranks Are Constantly Growing
    Zhuzhong Qingqi, Organization Minister of the Osaka Prefecture Federation of the Japan-China Friendship Association
    The common struggle of the people of Osaka Prefecture against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" developed in January 1959. At that time, a rally of the people of Osaka Prefecture, attended by 10,000 people, was held in Osaka to oppose the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," uphold the Constitution, and restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China. After the meeting, the masses held a demonstration march of about one day in the rain. This rally and march kicked off the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty." After that, the movement gradually deepened, and people from all walks of life in Osaka Prefecture were widely mobilized to participate in various national unified actions and daily struggles. After the American imperialist lackey Nobusuke Kishi signed the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in January of this year, our struggle developed into a struggle against the National Diet's approval of the new treaty. During the 13th unified action, rallies and demonstrations were held in four places in Osaka Prefecture. At this time, representatives who went to the Diet to petition were also successively produced, and the movement further developed in depth and breadth. Even people in the Osaka financial and economic circles, who had always been cautious about the "Security Treaty" issue, expressed their opposition to the Kishi Nobusuke government's forced approval of the new "Security Treaty."
    Recently, the Shanghai people's rally to support the Japanese people's struggle sent a telegram to the people of Osaka Prefecture. The great support of the people of Shanghai and the entire Chinese people has further stimulated the anti-American patriotic struggle of the people of Osaka Prefecture. The great action of the Chinese people in sympathizing with and supporting the Japanese people's struggle has made the Japanese people realize that the people of Japan and China are comrades fighting against a common enemy (American imperialism), and the Japanese people will drive the American imperialist lackey Nobusuke Kishi off the stage so that he will suffer the same fate as Syngman Rhee.

    我们的队伍在不断壮大
    日中友好协会大阪府联合会组织部长  猪冢清七
    大阪府人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的共同斗争，是在1959年1月发展起来的。当时，在大阪召开了有一万人参加的反对修改日美“安全条约”、拥护宪法、恢复日中邦交大阪府人民大会。会后群众冒雨举行了大约一日里的示威游行。这次大会游行揭开了反对修改“安全条约”斗争的序幕。之后，运动就逐渐深入，大阪府各界人民广泛地动员起来，参加了历次全国性统一行动和日常的斗争。在今年1月美帝国主义走狗岸信介签署了新日美“安全条约”以后，我们的斗争便发展为反对国会批准新条约的斗争。第十三次统一行动时，在大阪府内四个地方举行集会、示威游行。这时到国会去请愿的代表也相继产生，运动进一步朝深广发展，连一向对“安全条约”问题持慎重态度的大阪财政经济界人士，也表示反对岸信介政府强行批准新“安全条约”。
    最近，上海市人民支援日本人民斗争的大集会，对大阪府人民发出通电。上海人民和全中国人民的巨大支援，进一步激发了大阪府人民的反美爱国斗争。中国人民同情和支援日本人民斗争的伟大行动，促使日本人民觉悟到日中两国人民是为反对共同敌人（美帝国主义）而斗争的战友，日本人民要把美帝国主义走狗岸信介赶下台，使他遭到和李承晚同样命运。
