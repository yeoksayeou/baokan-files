Xinhua News Agency, Oslo, 14th. A mass rally protesting against American aircraft using Norwegian territory for espionage activities was held in Oslo, the capital of Norway, yesterday. Speakers at the rally condemned the bandit-like behavior of the United States and demanded that all American military aircraft be prohibited from landing in Norway. The speakers also demanded that the Norwegian government's policies must conform to the peaceful aspirations of the people. A demonstration followed the meeting.

Amidst strong protests from the Soviet Union and激愤 public sentiment in Norway, Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange acknowledged in parliament yesterday that the American spy plane shot down in the Soviet Union had indeed originally planned to land at Bodø Airport in Norway.

Lange said it had been determined that the American aircraft was en route to Bodø Airport when it was shot down. Lange said he had summoned the American ambassador and lodged a protest with the United States on behalf of the Norwegian government.

However, Lange did not admit that his government should bear the responsibility for providing territory to the United States for espionage activities against the Soviet Union. He merely said, "We can fully understand the Soviet Union's激愤 at what happened." But he then counter-alleged that the Soviet Union's stern warning to Norway on this matter was "a threat to Norway."

    抗议美机利用挪威领土从事间谍活动
    奥斯陆群众举行大会和示威
    新华社14日讯　奥斯陆消息：在挪威首都奥斯陆，昨天举行了抗议美国飞机利用挪威领土从事间谍活动的群众大会。在会上发言的人谴责了美国的强盗行为，并且要求一切美国军事飞机不准在挪威着陆。发言的人还要求挪威政府的政策必须符合人民的和平愿望。会后还举行了示威游行。
    在苏联提出严正抗议和挪威公众情绪激愤的情况下，挪威外交大臣兰格昨天在议会承认，在苏联被击落的美国间谍飞机确实原来计划要在挪威布德机场降落。
    兰格说，已经确定，那架美国飞机在被击落的时候是在飞往布德机场的途中。兰格说，他已经召见美国大使，代表挪威政府向美国提出了抗议。
    但是兰格没有承认他的政府对提供领土给美国向苏联进行间谍活动应负的责任。他只是说，“我们完全能了解苏联对所发生的事情的激愤之情”。但是他又反诬说苏联在这一事件上对挪威提出的严正警告是“对挪威的威胁”。
