    From the second half of 1959, under the leadership of the Party and influenced by the technological revolution, middle and primary schools, and kindergartens in Harbin City launched a large-scale mass movement of education tool experimentation, innovation, and creation, involving teachers, students, and parents. According to incomplete statistics shortly after the start of the school year in 1960, more than 10,000 innovative and original teaching tools have been created. After assessment by relevant departments, more than twenty schools have begun mass production. Currently, the schools have successfully trial-produced universal teaching tool boxes that can be used for more than a dozen demonstration activities. There are also demonstrators for coefficients, fractions, row planting, tree planting, etc. The most difficult teaching problems in the past can be quickly solved through these teaching tools. The Chinese language subject, which previously had the fewest teaching tools, now has a large number of complete sets of teaching tools.

    哈尔滨革新教具形成群众运动
    哈尔滨市中、小学，幼儿园，从1959年下半年，在党的领导下，在技术革命的影响下，掀起了规模巨大的、包括师生家长共同参加的教具实验革新创作的群众运动。根据1960年开学不久的不完全的统计，革新和创制的教具已达万件以上。经过有关方面鉴定后，有二十几个学校开始成批生产，目前各校已经试制成功的有万能教具箱，可以进行十几种演示活动。还有系数、分数、行植、植树等演示器，过去教学最难的问题，通过这些教具，就很快得到解决。过去教具最少的语文科，已出现大量的成套教具。
