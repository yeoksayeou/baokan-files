Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: In recent days, workers in Beijing have held meetings and discussions, denouncing the U.S. imperialists' despicable crime of instructing the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi reactionary clique to illegally "pass" the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty by barbaric fascist means, and firmly supporting the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle.

The workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, who had suffered from Japanese imperialism, were filled with righteous indignation. Veteran steel workers Li Lin, Li Bingzhong, Yao Yuemin and others gathered to warn the Japanese reactionaries: The era of imperialist rampage has long gone, and the American imperialists and Nobusuke Kishi want to plan a new war of aggression. The Chinese people, who have stood up, will never agree. Shi Chuanxiang, a national advanced producer and sanitation worker in Chongwen District, said that during the period of Japanese imperialist rule, he was beaten by Japanese devils until his head was bleeding. He angrily said: "Today, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries collude and want to invade us again, dreaming of letting us return to that dark life! We must always stand with the Japanese people and firmly support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle."

The vast number of workers in Beijing are closely watching the development of the Japanese people's struggle. Many workers at the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory rushed to read newspapers after work to learn about the new news of the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle. The workers wrote articles on the wall newspapers in the workshops, denouncing U.S. imperialism as the deadly enemy of peace-loving people all over the world, resolutely opposing the revival of Japanese militarism, and supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people.
