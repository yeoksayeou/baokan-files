A lackey always does his utmost to serve his master. If the master coughs, he quickly presents the spittoon; if the master farts, he quickly thinks up all kinds of hymns to compliment it as a rare fragrance in the world.

However, being a lackey isn't easy either. That is: when the master has done all kinds of bad things and has a terrible reputation, like a rat crossing the street, and everyone is yelling to beat him, the lackey still has to make up some words to cover up for the master, regardless of whether he can cover it up or not.

The Tito clique is now doing this errand. When fair world opinion is unanimously condemning the bandit behavior of American black airplanes, their mood, like their master's, is first annoyed and ashamed, and they cannot speak; then they feel that not speaking is not worth the dollars they received, and it is difficult to report back to the master. Therefore, they have to shout a few words to show their existence. The Tito clique described the aggressive crimes of American spy planes as "American planes flying into Soviet airspace," "a huge event happening between the United States and the Soviet Union," and "negative events"... From beginning to end, they dared not use words like "aggression" and "provocation." They were really cautious, doing their best to be sycophantic and helpful. However, they still want to insinuate and bite back, trying to add the crime of "disrupting the international atmosphere" and "darkening the prospects of the summit meeting" to the Soviet Union. It's really that they can't use decent weapons in their hands, so they just spit a few mouthfuls of saliva.

This is precisely where the ridiculous and shameful nature of lackeys lies, and it is precisely where the hateful nature of lackeys lies. In this battle, modern revisionists not only did not do anything for their masters, but also exposed their own true colors once again.

    奴才本性
    苗隼
    凡奴才，总是竭尽全力去为主子服务的。主人咳嗽一声，他赶紧把痰盂捧上去；主人放个屁，他赶紧想一切赞美诗来恭维那是世间罕闻的芳香。
    然而，奴才也并不好当。那就是：当主子做尽了坏事、声名狼籍，像老鼠过街，人人喊打的时候，当奴才的仍然要编些词儿来替主子遮丑，不管遮得了遮不了。
    铁托集团现在正在干这分差使。当全世界公正的舆论都在同声谴责美国黑色飞机的强盗行径的时候，它们的心情，先是跟它们的主子一样，既恼且羞，做声不得；继而觉得不做声岂不是白领了美元，主子面前不好报销，于是，也就不得不叫嚷几句，以表示自己的存在。铁托集团把美国间谍飞机的侵略罪行，说成“美国飞机飞入苏联领空”，“在美国和苏联之间发生了巨大的事情”，“消极事件”……从头到尾，他们不敢用“侵略”、“挑衅”这类的词。真是小心翼翼，竭尽谄媚帮闲之能事。然而，他们还想含沙射影，反咬一口，想把“扰乱国际气氛”、“使政府首脑会议前景阴暗”的罪名加到苏联身上。这真是手里使不出像样的武器，只好乱吐几口唾沫了。
    这正是奴才的可笑和可耻处，也正是奴才的可恨处。现代修正主义者在这一仗中，不但没有为主子尽什么力，连自己的底子也再一次被抖了出来。
