Xinhua News Agency, May 27th, Washington Dispatch: Under the strong condemnation of the world and the American people, U.S. President Eisenhower delivered a radio address to the nation on the evening of the 25th, shamelessly defending the U.S. spy plane intrusion into Soviet airspace, shirking U.S. responsibility for sabotaging the Paris Four-Power Summit Conference, and clamoring that the U.S. should continue to expand its armaments and prepare for war, vigorously promoting a policy of aggression and sabotage against socialist countries.

In his speech, Eisenhower made no secret of the fact that the U.S. government, headed by him, has never changed its policy of aggression and war. He stated that even after it had been decided to hold a summit conference, U.S. "own policies have not changed." The U.S. also "did not relax its vigilance or lower its guard" while preparing for the Four-Power Summit Conference.

Based on robber logic, Eisenhower once again blatantly insisted on the provocative policy of espionage reconnaissance.

He even said, "Our security, and the security of the free world, requires the possession of valid intelligence concerning the military capabilities and intentions of other powerful nations, particularly those who practice secrecy. …The gathering of this intelligence is indispensable to the safety of the free world. …This is part of my solemn responsibility to protect and defend our own country and our allies from surprise attack as the over-all problem of protecting the American people." He shamelessly said that the United States "urgently needs to continue collecting intelligence, maintaining military liaisons and contacts, and keeping command posts on alert." He openly admitted that "for a long time, (collecting intelligence on socialist countries) has been one of my most serious priorities." "As President and Commander-in-Chief, I take full responsibility for approving all the various plans for gathering and assessing military intelligence conducted by our government."

He also mentioned a worldwide "alert exercise" conducted by the U.S. hours before the scheduled start of the Four-Power Summit Conference, as part of a plan to sabotage the conference, disguising it as an effort to "test the continuous readiness of our military communications" when he and the U.S. Secretary of Defense were away from normal command posts. He also said that "such tests will be conducted frequently in the future."

Eisenhower admitted that sending spy planes to intrude into the Soviet Union has been a long-standing practice of the U.S., and is just one of the methods of U.S. espionage activities. He said, "Aerial photography has been one of the many means we have used...to keep abreast of important Soviet military developments in a timely manner. After four years of effort, the facts have fully demonstrated that this work is useful."

Eisenhower even shamelessly questioned the Soviet Union, "The Soviet Union knows this very well," "Why get so excited about one flight?"

When talking about why the United States sent a spy plane to violate Soviet airspace on the eve of the Four-Power Summit Conference, Eisenhower emphasized that the question was actually "whether to stop implementing this plan, thereby no longer collecting essential and important intelligence that may not be available later." He said, "This plan was still implemented." He also said, "When a country needs to carry out intelligence activities, it cannot relax its vigilance at any time."

Referring to the contradictory statements made by the U.S. regarding the U-2 spy plane incident, Eisenhower believed that it was necessary to lie and play tricks. He said that the reason why the U.S. initially issued a statement denying that the U-2 plane was engaged in espionage activities was because at that time, "the materials on the failure of this mission did not reveal whether the pilot was still alive" and "did not reveal whether the plane was destroyed and the person died." He said that in this case, "protecting our intelligence system and the pilot and concealing the mission of this aircraft still seemed urgent...Therefore, a statement was issued that intelligence officials called a 'cover statement.'" "The statement was issued to protect the pilot, his mission, and our intelligence work before the actual situation was determined."

He said that when "it was no longer possible to avoid exposing the plan, the details of the facts were provided. Two facts were explained to the public: our aerial reconnaissance plan was carried out with my approval; the U.S. government had to use this or that method to keep abreast of Soviet military activities in a timely manner."

He also seemed very proud of his clumsy lies, saying, "Our Secretary of State also stated that we need to conduct such activities, but he, like me, was careful not to say that this flight will continue."

Eisenhower also feigned that he "had instructed to stop the U-2 aircraft flights before leaving Washington." However, he went on to explain that this did not mean that such aggressive activities were no longer necessary. He admitted that this was only because the U.S. U-2 plane was shot down and the espionage activities were greatly exposed, "obviously their (referring to the U-2 aircraft's espionage activities) usefulness has been damaged. Moreover, continuing such an activity under this new situation cannot but complicate the relations between some of our allies and the Soviet Union. Moreover, new technologies outside of aircraft are constantly developing." Everyone knows that on the 24th of this month, the U.S. announced that it had launched an artificial satellite for military reconnaissance called "Midas II".

Eisenhower indicated that he originally wanted to deceive and prevaricate with the "already stopped flying" and "personally discuss this issue with him (Khrushchev)" and other ghost talk in response to the Soviet Minister Council Chairman Khrushchev's legitimate demand that the United States should condemn and stop the spy flights, make a public apology, and punish the culprits. When that didn't work, he put the responsibility for sabotaging the meeting on the Soviet Union. He said, "Obviously I would not agree to his extreme demands. Of course, he knows that the Soviet Union's insistence on those demands is to sabotage the summit meeting."

The actions of British Prime Minister Macmillan and French President De Gaulle in colluding with him in Paris to sabotage the Four-Power Summit Conference were highly praised by the American president. He said, "The behavior of our allies was excellent." "My colleagues and friends, President De Gaulle and Prime Minister Macmillan, firmly stood with the U.S. delegation."

When talking about the future plans and policies of the United States, Eisenhower once again flaunted his nuclear intimidation tactics. He said, "In a nuclear war, there can be no winners—only losers." "Recognizing this mutual destructive capability is the basic reality in our current relationship."

He put forward three points of policy: First, he vigorously advocated, "We must maintain our strength, and maintain it for a long time." He said, "Maintaining adequate defense has been one of my main concerns for seven years. The composition and size of our forces have not been based on or influenced by Soviet sweet talk in any way. The same will be true in the future." He clamored that the United States will continue to vigorously improve its forces "to make them ready at any time."

Secondly, Eisenhower shamelessly continued to wave the long-broken "peace" banner, saying that he would continue to make "peaceful efforts," "including participating in the current negotiations with the Soviet Union." He hypocritically said that the U.S. is prepared to "make progress" on nuclear testing and disarmament issues.

But he made it clear that the "important goal" of the United States is to achieve the so-called "open skies plan" that would legalize intelligence gathering. He said that the United States will submit this plan to the United Nations at an appropriate time, and will use the United Nations as a tool to implement this plan.

Third, Eisenhower advocated that the United States should strengthen its penetration of underdeveloped countries. He said that the United States must not relax "assistance" to these countries, "must not make huge cuts in the appropriations proposed for the common security program, whether economic or military." He called the U.S. strengthening its control over these countries "strengthening freedom."

    艾森豪威尔供认美国从未改变战争政策
    竭力为美机侵苏事件辩解并推卸破坏首脑会议罪责
    叫嚷加紧备战对社会主义国家进行侵略和破坏活动
    新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：在全世界和美国人民的强烈谴责下，美国总统艾森豪威尔25日晚上向美国全国发表了一篇广播演说，为美国间谍飞机侵苏事件进行无耻辩解，推卸美国破坏巴黎四国政府首脑会议的罪责，并且叫嚣美国要继续扩军备战，大力推行针对社会主义国家的侵略和破坏活动的政策。
    艾森豪威尔在演说里毫不掩饰以他为首的美国政府从来没有改变侵略和战争政策。他表明，即使已经确定召开首脑会议，美国“自己的政策也没有改变”。美国在为四国政府首脑会议进行准备时，也“并没有放松戒备或放松警惕”。
    艾森豪威尔根据强盗逻辑，再一次明目张胆地坚持间谍侦察的挑衅政策。
    他竟然说，“我们的安全以及自由世界的安全要求具备有效的系统来搜集关于其他强国、特别是一味喜欢保密的国家的军事能力的情报。……搜集这种情报对于自由世界的安全是必不可少的。……这是我在保护美国人民这个总的问题中保卫我们自己和我们的盟国免遭突袭的严重责任的一部分。”他厚颜无耻地说，美国“迫切需要不断搜集情报、保持军事联络和接触和使指挥部处于戒备状态。”他直认不讳地说，“长期以来，（搜集社会主义国家的情报）一直是我最认真优先考虑的问题之一”。“作为总统和（三军）总司令，我对批准我国政府进行的所有各种搜集和估计军事情报的计划担负完全的责任。”
    他还谈到美国在四国政府首脑会议预定要举行之前几小时进行的、作为破坏会议的计划的一部分的一次世界范围的“戒备演习”，他掩饰说，这是为了在他和美国防部长远离正常指挥所时“试验我们的军事联络的持续的准备状况”。他并且说“今后将经常进行这种试验”。
    艾森豪威尔承认，派遣间谍飞机入侵苏联是美国长期以来就进行的，而且不过是美国间谍活动方式中的一种。他说，“空中摄影一直是我们用来……及时了解苏联的重要军事发展的许多方法之一。经过四年的努力，事实充分证明这种工作是有用的。”
    艾森豪威尔竟然无耻之极地反而责问苏联，“苏联很知道这一点”，“为什么要对某一次飞行大冒其火呢？”
    艾森豪威尔谈到美国何以在四国政府首脑会议前夕，派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联的问题时，他强调这个问题实际是“是否停止执行这项计划，从而不再收集必不可少的、在以后很可能得不到的重要情报”的问题。他说，“这项计划还是执行了”。他还说，“当一个国家需要进行情报活动的时候，任何时候也不能放松警惕。”
    在谈到美国就U—2间谍飞机事件先后发表的矛盾百出的一些声明时，艾森豪威尔认为应当说谎耍赖。他说，美国第一次所以要发表否认U—2飞机从事间谍活动的声明，是因为当时“关于这次使命失败的材料并没有透露驾驶员是否还活着”“也没有透露是否机毁人亡”。他说，在这种情况下，“保护我们的情报系统和驾驶员并掩饰这架飞机的使命看来仍然是紧迫的……因此，发表了一项情报界人士称之为‘掩护声明’的声明”。“发表这项声明是为了在实际情况还没有确定以前保护驾驶员、他的使命以及我们的情报工作”。
    他说，当“再也不可能避免暴露这项计划的时候，就提供了事实的细节。向公众说明了两个事实：我们的空中侦察计划是在得到我的批准的情况下进行的；美国政府不得不用这一种或那一种办法及时了解苏联的军事活动”。
    他并且似乎对他的蠢笨的谎话很得意，他说，“我们的国务卿也声明我们有必要进行这种活动，但是他像我一样都小心地不说这种飞行将继续进行”。
    艾森豪威尔在演说中还装腔作势说，他“在离开华盛顿之前已经指示停止U—2飞机的飞行了”。但是，他接着就说明，这丝毫不意味这种侵略活动已无必要。他承认，这只是由于美国U—2飞机的被击落和间谍活动的大暴露，“显然它们（指U—2飞机的间谍活动）的用处已经受到损害。而且，在这种新的情况下继续进行这样一种活动就不能不使得我们某些盟国同苏联的关系复杂化。而且，飞机之外的新技术经常在发展。”大家知道，在本月24日，美国宣布它已经发射了一个供军事侦察用的人造卫星
  “米达斯二号”。
    艾森豪威尔表明，他对于苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫提出的美国应谴责和停止间谍飞行，公开道歉和惩办祸首的正当要求，原来想用“已停止飞行”和“亲自同他（赫鲁晓夫）讨论这个问题”等鬼话来欺骗搪塞过去。不成功，就把破坏会议的责任推给苏联。他说，“显然我是不会答应他的极端的要求的。当然他知道，苏联坚持那些要求就是破坏最高级会议。”
    英国首相麦克米伦和法国总统戴高乐在巴黎同他串通一气破坏四国政府首脑会议的行径被这位美国总统大肆称赞。他说，“我们的盟国的行为好极了”。“我的同僚和朋友戴高乐总统和麦克米伦首相都坚决地同美国代表团站在一起”。
    在谈到美国今后的打算和政策时，艾森豪威尔又卖弄他的核恫吓手法。他说，“在一场核战争中，不可能有胜利者——只有失败者。”
  “承认这种相互毁灭的能力是我们目前关系中的基本的现实”。
    他提出了三点政策：首先他大肆鼓吹，“我们必须保持我们的实力，并且长期保持下去”。他说，
  “保持充分的防务是我七年来主要关心的事情之一。我们部队的组成和规模在任何方面都没有以苏联的甜言蜜语为基础，或者受到这种甜言蜜语的影响。以后也是如此。”他叫嚷说，美国将继续大力改进它的部队，“使它们随时作好准备”。
    其次，艾森豪威尔无耻地继续打起早已破碎不堪的“和平”幌子，说什么要继续进行“和平的努力”，
  “包括参加目前同苏联进行的谈判”。他假惺惺地说，美国准备在核试验和裁军问题上“取得进展”。
    但是他表明，美国的“重要目标”是实现使搜集情报合法化的所谓“开放天空计划”。他表示美国将在适当时候向联合国提出这个计划，并且要利用联合国作为执行这一计划的工具。
    第三，艾森豪威尔鼓吹美国要加强对不发达国家的侵入。他说，美国决不能放松对这些国家的“援助”，“决不能对建议用于共同安全计划的拨款，不论是经济方面的和军事方面的拨款，作巨大的削减。”他把美国加强对这些国家的控制称作“加强自由”。
