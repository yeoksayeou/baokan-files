Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: The headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, its Beijing branch, and Taiwan compatriots in the capital held a rally tonight to commemorate the third anniversary of the "May 24th" patriotic anti-American demonstration by the people of Taiwan. In their speeches, they furiously denounced the towering crimes committed by the American aggressors in Taiwan, passionately demanding that U.S. imperialism get out of Taiwan.

The meeting was presided over by Xu Mengshan, Secretary-General of the Taiwan League Headquarters. In his speech, Xu Mengshan pointed out that three years ago, on May 24th, the fervent people of Taiwan broke out in a patriotic anti-American demonstration that shocked the world. Xu Mengshan pointed out that for the past three years, Taiwan compatriots have been persistently struggling against American aggression and enslavement, with anti-American incidents occurring one after another. The hatred of the people of Taiwan for the American aggressors has never been as profound as it is today. Xu Mengshan said that the aggression, enslavement, and exploitation by U.S. imperialism are the root cause of all the pain and suffering of Taiwan compatriots. The cruel disasters imposed on the people of Taiwan by U.S. imperialism cannot but arouse increasingly strong resistance from the people of Taiwan.

Xu Mengshan emphatically pointed out that the current international situation is very favorable to the anti-American struggle of the people of Taiwan. The strong will of the people of Taiwan to drive out the American aggressors and strive for Taiwan's return to the embrace of the motherland will surely be realized soon. Taiwan compatriots on the mainland are determined to fight to the end to overthrow the common enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, and to liberate Taiwan.

Taiwanese figures in the capital, including Tian Fuda, Xie Nanguang, and Chen Wenbin, also spoke at the meeting.

Tian Fuda, a representative of the National People's Congress, condemned U.S. imperialism for recently creating international tensions everywhere, while intensifying the use of military bases in Taiwan to threaten mainland China and other regions of Asia. Tian Fuda said that it is foreseeable that, with the support and encouragement of the powerful people of the motherland and the people of the world, the day will eventually come when the people of Taiwan will erupt in an even larger storm of anti-American struggle.

Xie Nanguang, a representative of the National People's Congress, denounced the crimes of U.S. imperialism in occupying Taiwan and warned the Nobusuke Kishi traitorous clique of Japan not to dream of reliving the illusion of invading Taiwan by relying on the power of U.S. imperialism. Xie Nanguang said that we fully support the struggle of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi traitorous clique, and we must smash the conspiracies of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries.

Chen Wenbin, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, cited many facts in his speech, denouncing the crimes of U.S. imperialism in poisoning Taiwanese youth with the "American way of life" and decadent bourgeois "culture." Chen Wenbin said that the poisoning of Taiwanese youth by American "culture" exposes the jackal and robber face of U.S. imperialism. We, ten million Taiwan compatriots, must be liberated from the clutches of U.S. imperialism.

Yang Chunsong, Su Ziheng, Qiu Qiong Yun, a female professor from Taiwan, and Chen Liansheng, a Gaoshan ethnic compatriot, all members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, expressed that they must better study Mao Zedong Thought, further understand the essence of imperialism, actively participate in socialist construction, and contribute to the liberation of Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, May 23rd: People from all walks of life in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, held a rally today to commemorate the third anniversary of the "May 24th" anti-American patriotic struggle of the people of Taiwan. More than 1,500 people attended the meeting, including representatives of various democratic parties, Taiwan compatriots in Fuzhou, former Kuomintang military and political personnel, family members of Taiwan military and political personnel, and returned overseas Chinese.

Liu Tong, Vice Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Wang Tianqiang, a Taiwan compatriot and Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, Li Shijia, former Rear Admiral and Vice Minister of the Kuomintang Navy Department and current member of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Lian Tiesheng, former Lieutenant General and Deputy Commander of the 62nd Army of the Kuomintang and current member of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, spoke at the meeting. They unanimously denounced the U.S. imperialism for occupying China's territory of Taiwan, massacring Taiwan compatriots, and attempting to create a "two Chinas" sinister plot. They unanimously expressed their support for the just struggle of the Taiwan people against the U.S. and called on the Taiwan compatriots and the people of the mainland to unite and drive the U.S. imperialism out of Taiwan. Liu Tianming and Liang Xuming, family members of Taiwan military and political personnel, and others also spoke at the meeting. They all hoped that their husbands, brothers, fathers, etc., would quickly awaken, abandon the darkness and turn to the light, join the Taiwan people in driving away the American aggressors, and reunite with their families soon.
