Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 10th. Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, at a reception held at the Czechoslovakian Embassy in Moscow on the 9th, once again condemned the recent provocative actions of American planes against the Soviet Union. He said, "If anyone intends to fly in our airspace, reconnoiter targets, and search for state secrets, then we will shoot down such planes, and only shoot them down!"

He also said, "Furthermore, if such flights occur again, then we will take corresponding countermeasures. I can say this: those countries that have bases on their own territory should remember the following words: if they allow planes to fly from their bases to our territory, we will strike those bases. Because we consider this action to be a provocation against our country!"

Khrushchev made these remarks at a reception held to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia.

Khrushchev said, "What is the purpose of this flight? Provocation! ... It was done deliberately, deliberately on the eve of the Paris Summit of heads of government. It is said that this was done by warmongers. Only warmongers? If warmongers can do things that the government opposes, then what kind of country is that? How can the government tolerate it?" He said, "If the situation in a country is that everyone does their own thing, what kind of country is that, and how can people believe in the policies of such a country? The policies of such a country cannot be trusted! It is disgraceful for the US State Department to say that the aggressive flight of the plane was not carried out according to the government's wishes and instructions, and that the State Department did not know all of this. What about Allen Dulles? You should know that he knows all of this, and he is also an official of the US government! This is Allen Dulles's air force!"

Khrushchev said, "It is also possible that I do not know the matter accurately, but I do not rule out the possibility that the US government knew about this flight."

Khrushchev continued, "The State Department's statement also blames us for not allowing people who want to study our national defense and inquire about secrets to come to our country by plane, car, ship, or on foot. Therefore, they, the US government, had to send planes with reconnaissance purposes. This is a very dangerous explanation." "Some gentlemen are just using this as an excuse to try to win the right in public opinion to continue flying in our airspace in the future in order to reconnoiter important military secrets.

I repeat again - this is very dangerous, not to mention that it is incorrect in principle and does not conform to the spirit of international peaceful relations."

Khrushchev emphasized, "I can say this: those countries that have bases on their own territory should remember the following words: if they allow planes to fly from their bases to our territory, we will strike those bases. Because we consider this action to be a provocation against our country!

We want to say to the governments of these countries: if you lease out your territory and do not act as masters of your own territory and your own country, then we should look at this issue according to our own understanding. Those who lease your territory are opposing us from your territory. Because their territory is far from us, but yours is very close. Therefore, in order to warn distant targets, we must also aim at close ones. Please draw the necessary conclusions from this."

Khrushchev then talked about the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. He said that if the Western countries are unwilling to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, then we will have to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic. If after the conclusion of the peace treaty, anyone still wants to use force to rush into West Berlin - we hope that this city will become a free city - then we will also use force to deal with such force.

    赫鲁晓夫在庆祝捷解放日招待会上说
    苏联将坚决击落一切空中强盗
    租让基地允许美机继续侵犯者，苏联将打击这些基地
    新华社莫斯科10日电　苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫9日在捷克斯洛伐克驻莫斯科大使馆举行的招待会上，再一次谴责了美国飞机最近对苏联的挑衅行为。他说：“如果有人打算在我国领空飞行、侦察目标并搜寻国家秘密的话，那么，我们将击落这样的飞机，也只有击落它们！”
    他又说：“此外，如果这样的飞行再发生，那么，我们就要采取相应的对策。我可以这样说：那些在本国领土上设有基地的国家应该好好记住下面的话：如果他们允许飞机从他们的基地飞到我国领土的话，我们就将打击这些基地。因为我们认为这种行动是对我国的挑衅！”
    赫鲁晓夫是在为庆祝捷克斯洛伐克解放十五周年而举行的招待会上说这番话的。
    赫鲁晓夫说：“这次飞行的目的是什么呢？挑衅！……这样做是故意的，是故意在各国政府首脑巴黎会议的前夕这样做的。据说，这是黩武主义者干出来的事。仅仅是黩武主义者吗？如果黩武主义者能做政府所反对的事，那么这算是怎么样一个国家呢？政府怎能容忍呢？”他说，“如果在一个国家里的情况是各行其是，这算是什么样的国家，又怎能使人相信这样的国家的政策？对这种国家的政策不能信任！说飞机的侵略飞行不是遵照政府的意愿和指令进行的，说国务院不知道所有这一切，这样的声明对美国国务院是不光彩的。艾伦·杜勒斯怎么办呢？要知道，他知道所有这一切，他也是美国政府的官员！这是艾伦·杜勒斯的空军！”
    赫鲁晓夫说：“也可能我对这件事知道得不准确，但是我不排斥这样一点：美国政府是知道这次飞行的。”
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，美国国务院的“声明中还责怪我们没有允许想来研究我国国防、探听秘密的人坐飞机、乘车乘船或步行到我国来。因此他们，即美国政府才不得不派抱有侦察目的的飞机来。这是一种非常危险的解释”。“某些先生们只是用这一点作借口，打算在舆论中为自己争得今后仍在我国领空飞行以便侦察重要军事秘密的权利。
    我再重说一遍——这是非常危险的，更不要说这在原则上是不正确的，是不符合国际和平关系的精神的”。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说：“我可以这样说：那些在本国领土上设有基地的国家应该好好记住下面的话：如果他们允许飞机从他们的基地飞到我国领土的话，我们就将打击这些基地。因为我们认为这种行动是对我国的挑衅！
    我们要对这些国家的政府说：如果你们把自己的领土租让出去，自己不作自己领土和自己国家的主人的话，那么，我们就应该按照自己的理解来看待这个问题。租借你们领土的人从你们的领土上反对我们。因为他们的领土距我们很远，而你们的却很近。因此，为了警告远的目标，我们也要瞄准近的。请从这里得出应有的结论吧。”
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到缔结对德和约，他说，如果西方国家不愿意缔结对德和约，那么，我们就不得不将同德意志民主共和国缔结和约。如果在缔结和约后还有谁想要用武力冲到西柏林——我们希望这个城市成为自由城市——那末我们也将用武力来对付这种武力。
