Xinhua News Agency reports: People from all walks of life in Liaoning Province, Shenyang City, Hunan Province, Wuhan City, and Harbin City firmly support the Soviet Union's solemn stance on the Four-Power Summit and strongly condemn the U.S. for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit and plotting new wars.

Ning Wu, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: The position taken by the Soviet Union is solemn. Since Eisenhower evaded responsibility for the invasion, the Four-Power Summit cannot proceed. He said: Eisenhower's unreasonable attitude after Khrushchev's statement was issued clearly demonstrates the nature of U.S. imperialism, which fears peace and insists on war. Chen Xianzhou, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Che Xiangchen, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Yu Zijing, Vice Chairman of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, and He Mulin, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, all strongly condemned the U.S. war policy in their speeches and expressed their firm support for the Soviet Union's solemn stance on the Four-Power Summit.

Representatives from the educational, artistic, engineering and technical personnel, religious, ethnic minority, and returned overseas Chinese communities in Shenyang City who attended the meeting also expressed their firm solidarity with the Soviet people in their speeches, fighting to thoroughly crush the U.S. imperialist plot to plan new wars and to strive for lasting world peace.

Workers at the Dongfeng Steel Plant in Changsha held a meeting after seeing the news released in the newspaper. Zhang Xinglong, a worker in the rolling mill workshop, said: "The ferocious face of U.S. imperialism has been completely exposed. The war-mongers are honey-mouthed and have daggers hidden behind their smiles. They talk about peace, but they are actually engaged in war conspiracies. The Soviet government's solemn stance on U.S. war provocations is completely correct. We firmly support Chairman Khrushchev's statement."

The broad masses of commune members in rural people's communes also expressed their firm support for Chairman Khrushchev's statement. Cao Jianhe, a member of the Qifengdu People's Commune in Chen County, said: "Eisenhower, this so-called 'peace envoy,' can no longer hide his robber face this time."

Teachers and students at Hunan University also held meetings to support Khrushchev's statement.

When Chairman Khrushchev's statement reached the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant, the steelworkers who were working hard for steel all unanimously expressed their warm support. Wang Rongjiu, head of the steelmaking class A and a famous advanced producer of Wuhan Iron and Steel, said: American planes invaded Soviet airspace for espionage activities before the Four-Power Summit. After its aggressive behavior was exposed, Eisenhower and the U.S. government showed no remorse. This thoroughly exposes the ferocious nature of U.S. imperialism. Yangtze River seamen also condemned the banditry of U.S. imperialism. Hu Yumei, a representative who attended the National Congress of Heroes and Models and a service worker at the Wuhan Port Authority Passenger Station, said: Chairman Khrushchev's statement completely represents the wishes of the people of the world. Only by thoroughly exposing the aggressive face of U.S. imperialism and resolutely fighting can we defend world peace.

Teachers and students from major universities and colleges in Wuhan have posted big-character posters and held meetings in recent days to firmly support Chairman Khrushchev's solemn stance.

The heads of trade unions, Communist Youth League organizations, women's federations, and organizations such as the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the China Democratic League in Wuhan have all issued statements and talks these days, expressing their full support for the position taken by Chairman Khrushchev's statement.

On the afternoon of the 19th, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the Harbin Municipal Committee of the CPPCC jointly held an expanded meeting of the Standing Committee to support Khrushchev's statement. Huang Fanggang, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Du Guangyu, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Liu Peizhi, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, Jia Lianyuan, Deputy Chairman of the Harbin Branch of the Jiusan Society, Wang Qingzheng, a non-party democratic person, as well as heads of various people's organizations and religious figures, all spoke at the meeting, expressing their firm support for Khrushchev's statement and strongly condemning the aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism.

On the 19th, people from all walks of life in Harbin also held forums to support Khrushchev's statement. Workers from the Harbin Meat Joint Processing Plant and the First Tool Factory also posted big-character posters, firmly supporting Khrushchev's statement and condemning the aggressive behavior of U.S. imperialism.
