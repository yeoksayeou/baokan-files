　　Think About the Next Step After Taking One

　　Why is it that some comrades are sometimes bogged down in passive and chaotic work, unable to handle things with ease? An important reason is that they only care about today and forget about tomorrow. Of course, some comrades do not fail to understand the relationship between one stage and the next in construction work. However, in their work, they always feel that the next step is, after all, the next step, and the current work is the most important. This is a manifestation of a lack of foresight. When we engage in economic construction, we must seize the current work at all times and strive to complete the plan in a faster, better, and more economical way; but we must also see that whether the current production can be done well and whether the plan can be completed largely depends on whether the preparatory work in the previous step has been done sufficiently. In other words, only by grasping the current production and, at the same time, never relaxing the preparatory work, having foresight, anticipating new problems that may arise in the next step, and making plans and arrangements early, can we create conditions for completing the plan in the next step. (Excerpt from Qinghai Daily)

    走上步就要想下步
    现在，为什么有些人有时工作陷于被动忙乱，不能得心应手呢？一个重要的原因，他们只是顾了今天，忘了明天。当然，有些同志并不是不懂得建设事业上一阶段和下一阶段相联系的关系。但是，他们在工作中，总觉得下一步的工作毕竟是下一步的工作，当前的工作才是顶重要的。这是一种缺乏远见的表现。我们搞经济建设，在任何时候都要抓紧当前的工作，争取多快好省地完成计划；但也必须看到，当前生产能不能抓好，计划能不能完成，在很大程度上却决定于上一步的准备工作做得是否充分。换句话说，只有在抓当前生产的同时，一刻也不放松准备工作，高瞻远瞩，预见下一步可能出现的新问题，早作筹划安排，这样，才能为下一步完成计划创造条件。　（摘自青海日报）
