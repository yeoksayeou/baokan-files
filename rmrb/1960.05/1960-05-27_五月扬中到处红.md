May in Yangzhong is Red Everywhere
Special Correspondent Hong Tao

Red May, arriving in Yangzhong, everything is red. Above the Leap Forward gate hangs a large red banner: "Summarize the experience of bumper harvests, tap the potential for increased production, muster even greater enthusiasm, and strive to achieve 1,000 catties of wheat per mu!" Red flags are planted everywhere in the fields, and people are rushing to harvest the golden "Yangzhong Red" wheat. In the county party committee office, high-yield red reports from various communes and brigades are constantly received. The county party committee secretary is busy tallying:

This commune threshed fifty mu of "March Yellow" wheat, with an average yield of 420 catties per mu; that commune threshed one hundred mu of "Yangzhong Red," with an average yield of 580 catties per mu.... One high-yield red report after another reveals that Yangzhong County, which once held high the red flag of high wheat production, has achieved even greater harvests this year, and the high-yield red flag will be raised higher and higher in the Yangtze River.

In the days of the bumper harvest, there is joy everywhere, and even the Yangtze River water seems to be boiling and laughing. In the Happiness Commune, which is surrounded by rivers on all sides, commune members can see the ships in the heart of the river when they stand on the tall wheat stacks. Looking at the abundant wheat everywhere, the commune members couldn't help but sing: "High yield waves are chasing wave, golden wheat is like the Yangtze River..."

    Saw it with my own eyes this time

At the start of the harvest, what exactly did the wheat grow like this year, and how much could it yield per mu? This became the focus of discussion for some elderly commune members. In the Sanmao Commune, Grandma Wu, who was over seventy years old and hadn't participated in labor for four or five years, mostly stayed at home and heard about many new changes after communization, but rarely saw them. This time, after hearing other elders tell her that one mu of wheat could yield six or seven hundred catties, she was always somewhat doubtful. In order to verify it with her own eyes, she decided to go to the fields and see the world. However, the team cadres, seeing that she was old, did not let her go to the fields. She said, "Even a small sparrow can flap its wings!" The cadres couldn't dissuade her, so they had to accompany her to the fields. When she saw that the wheat was so good, she excitedly cut a few handfuls of wheat, looked up, and took a long breath, saying, "Good, this is really wheat that yields six or seven hundred catties per mu! Look, the ear is like a horse's tail, the stalk is like a reed, even snakes can't get in. I've been cutting wheat for decades, and I've never cut wheat that's so thick and so hard. The benefits of communization, I've seen with my own eyes this time."

                Guests from Shandong

Gong Xuelu, the father-in-law of the director of Yangzhong County Hospital, is a member of the Jiangtuan Commune in Laiyang County, Shandong Province, and came to Yangzhong from afar to visit relatives. This day, when the director went to the fields to cut wheat, he followed along. Walking into the fields, seeing the round and plump ears of wheat, he exclaimed, "I've never seen such good wheat, it grows so neatly!" While helping the people of Yangzhong rush to cut wheat, he exchanged experiences in high wheat yields with the people of Yangzhong. He compared the Yangzhong experience with his own commune, and said: We in Shandong have long heard that the people of Yangzhong know how to grow wheat, and in the past two years, we have also been learning from Yangzhong and catching up with Yangzhong. Without seeing it, you won't know; this time, coming to Yangzhong, I learned two major experiences: The first is that we in the north don't fertilize as much as Yangzhong, especially when we use dry manure in the north, the fertilizer effect will run away; Yangzhong uses liquid manure, and the fertilizer effect doesn't run away. The second is that we in the north don't manage the wheat fields as carefully as Yangzhong, and high yields can only come from meticulous work."

              Again, the earliest in the county

On the evening of May 21st, on a highway from Youfang Town to Sanmao Town, people formed a long line, carrying red flags, beating gongs and drums, and transporting state grain purchases in large carts, small carts, large loads, and small loads. This grain delivery team was from the Tongle Brigade of the Youfang Commune. The cadres of the nearby Sanmao Commune saw this and held a meeting overnight, discussing the need to speed up threshing the next day and deliver the grain to the warehouse early. At the same time, they praised the cadres and commune members of the Youfang Commune: "They were the first in the county to deliver grain to the warehouse last year, and unexpectedly, they are the first in the county again this year."

              County Party Secretary and Old Master

This year's triple-cropping of wheat has just begun, and Zhu Weizhong, the first secretary of the county party committee, is already considering next year's production. He specially went to the Baqiao Commune to find his old master, Huang Meishan, and in a piece of experimental field they jointly cultivated, they studied and summarized this year's experience in the triple-cropping of wheat, preparing to propose a plan for even greater leaps forward next year.

This experimental field totals three mu and one fen, with an average yield of 690 catties per mu. If more than 30% of the wheat seedlings had not been knocked down by this year's spring snow, the yield could have been 1,000 catties per mu. Comrade Zhu Weizhong once guided the county's triple-cropping of wheat production through this experimental field, and now he is using this experimental field to explore the experience of achieving even higher yields of wheat. He talked with the old master for a long time, and the main experiences gained were: Apply double-layer base fertilizer at once; select superior strains of "Yangzhong Red" from ears and grains; stick to the season from planting to management and from management to harvest. After the county party secretary conducted a preliminary summary in the field, he tightly grasped the old master's hand and earnestly asked: "Old Huang, do you think that if our Yangzhong County firmly grasps these high-yield experiences, especially if we improve the fertilizer situation, can we have another great leap forward next year?" Huang Meishan, this ideologically advanced old farmer, smiled and said, "Yes, yes! We guarantee that we will listen to the Party and will definitely raise the high-yield red flag of Yangzhong higher and higher." The county party secretary and the old master smiled at each other, and their smiles were filled with confidence in moving from victory to even greater victory.

    五月扬中到处红
    本报特约通讯员　洪滔
    红5月，走到扬中，到处是红。跃进门上悬着大红标语：“总结丰收经验，挖掘增产潜力，鼓足更大干劲，必争三麦千斤”；田野里到处插着大红旗，人们正在抢收金光灿灿的“扬中红”小麦；在县委办公室里，不断收到来自各公社、大队的高产大红喜报。县委秘书应接不暇地统计着：
    这个社脱粒五十亩“三月黄”麦，平均亩产四百二十斤；那个社脱粒一百亩“扬中红”，平均亩产五百八十斤……。一张张的大红喜报，揭示了曾经高举三麦高产红旗的扬中县，今年又获得更大丰收，高产红旗将在扬子江中越举越高。
    在丰收的日子里，到处是喜气洋洋，连扬子江水也仿佛在沸腾欢笑。四面环江的幸福公社，社员站在高大的麦垛上堆麦时，都能看得见江心里的轮船。社员们望着遍地丰收的麦子，情不自禁地唱道：“高产一浪赶一浪，金黄麦子像长江……”。
        这回亲眼看到了
    在开镰收割时，对于今年麦子究竟长得怎么好，估计每亩能收多少？成为一些老年社员的议论中心。三茅公社有一个已经四、五年不参加劳动的七十来岁的吴奶奶，她成年躺在家里不出门，对公社化以后的许多新变化，都是听的多见的少。这次听别的老人告诉她，一亩麦子好收六、七百斤，她总是有些将信将疑。为了亲眼对实，她就决心下田，见见世面。可是，小队干部见她年老，不让她下田。她说：“麻雀虽小，翅膀也好搧搧风呀！。”干部劝阻不住，只好陪她下田。她见麦子这么好，兴奋地割了几把麦，抬起头来长长地呼了口气说：“好啊，这真是一亩收六、七百斤的麦子！你看，穗就像马尾，麦秆就像芦柴，连蛇也进不来。我割了几十年麦，从来没有割过这样厚、这样硬的麦。公社化的好处，这回亲眼看到了。”
                山东来客
    扬中县卫生院院长的公公宫学录，是山东莱阳县姜疃公社的社员，远道来扬中探亲。这天，院长下田割麦，他也跟了一道去割。走到田里，看到那圆滚滚、胖墩墩的麦穗，就惊叹道：“从来没有见过这样好麦，长得真齐整！”他一面帮助扬中人抢割麦子，一面跟扬中人交流三麦丰产经验。他把扬中经验跟自己公社作了个对比，他说：咱们山东老早就听说扬中人会种麦，这两年也在学扬中、赶扬中。不见不识，这次来到扬中学到两大经验：头一条是，咱们北边喂肥不如扬中多，特别是北边喂干粪，肥效要跑；扬中喂水粪，肥效不跑。第二条是，咱们北边麦田管理不如扬中细，花细工才能出高产。”
              又是全县第一早
    5月21日傍晚，从油坊镇到三茅镇的一条公路上，人们排成了一条龙，扛着红旗，敲着锣鼓，正在大一车、小一车，大一担、小一担地运送国家征购粮。这支送粮队伍是油坊公社同乐大队的。附近的三茅公社干部看到了，就连夜开会，商量着在第二天也抓紧脱粒，提早送粮入库。同时称赞油坊公社的干部和社员：“他们去年送粮入库全县第一早，今年想不到又是全县第一早。”
              县委书记和老师傅
    今年三麦才登场，县委第一书记朱维中又在考虑明年的生产了。他特地赶到八桥公社，找他的老师傅黄美善，在他们合种的一块试验田里，研究总结今年的三麦丰产经验，准备提出明年更大跃进的规划。
    这块试验田一共是三亩一分，平均亩产六百九十斤，如果不是被今年春雪压倒30％以上的麦苗，就可能亩产千斤。朱维中同志曾经通过这块试验田指导着全县的三麦生产，现在又通过这块试验田摸索出三麦高产更高产的经验。他和老师傅谈了很久，得到的主要经验是：双层基肥一次下；穗选、粒选“扬中红”良种；从种到管、从管到收，一直啃住季节。这位县委书记在田头进行初步总结后，紧握着老师傅的手，恳切地问：“老黄，你看我们扬中县如果狠狠抓住这几条丰产经验，特别是把肥料搞上去，明年能不能再来个大跃进？”黄美善，这位思想进步的老农笑嘻嘻地说：“能，能！我们保证听党的话，一定把扬中的三麦高产红旗越举越高。”县委书记和老师傅相对地微笑着，从他们的微笑里，充满着从胜利走向更大胜利的信心。
