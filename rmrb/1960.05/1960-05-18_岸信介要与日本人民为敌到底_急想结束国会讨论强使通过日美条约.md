    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: Regardless of the strong opposition from the Japanese people and the people of various countries, Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke yesterday once again expressed his intention to force the Japanese Diet to ratify the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.
    Kishi Nobusuke expressed this stubborn attitude, hostile to the people and to peace, during a round-table discussion held by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation.
    During the round-table discussion, Kishi Nobusuke did his utmost to show his loyalty to his American masters. He said that if the new "Security Treaty" cannot be passed by the current Diet, "Japan, belonging to the free world camp, will lose international credibility."
    Kishi Nobusuke also stated at the meeting that he wanted to deprive the opposition parties of the right to seriously deliberate on the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." He said that the Diet's deliberation on the new "Security Treaty" had taken up "enough time," and that spending more time discussing it in the future would not eliminate the opposition to the treaty. He declared: "Now is the time to have it passed in both houses of the Diet."
    Kishi Nobusuke also openly defended the infamous American spy planes. He insisted that the U-2 aircraft stationed in Japan "have made great contributions to observing the weather, especially typhoons."
    As previously reported, Toshio Tada, Deputy Director-General of the Japan Meteorological Agency, told "Asahi Shimbun" reporters on the 13th that the Japan Meteorological Agency had never received meteorological information from U-2 aircraft.
    Ichiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Socialist Party, who attended yesterday's round-table discussion, pointed out that through the U-2 aircraft incident, many Japanese people have realized that the United States is manufacturing war, and a growing number of people are demanding the abolition of the new "Security Treaty."
    The leader of Japan's largest opposition party demanded the immediate dissolution of the Diet.
    He also firmly stated that in the last ten days of the Diet session, the Socialist Party will fight with all its strength to smash the new "Security Treaty."

    岸信介要与日本人民为敌到底
    急想结束国会讨论强使通过日美条约
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：不顾日本人民和各国人民的强烈反对，日本首相岸信介昨天再次表示要强使日本国会批准侵略性的日美军事同盟条约。
    岸信介是在日本广播协会举行的一个座谈会上表示他这种与人民与和平为敌的顽固态度的。
    岸信介在座谈会上竭力表示他对美国主子的忠诚。他说，如果新“安全条约”不能在本届国会通过，“属于自由主义阵营的日本将失去国际信用”。
    岸信介在会上还表示要剥夺在野党对新日美“安全条约”进行认真审议的权利，他说，国会对新“安全条约”的审议已经花费了“足够的时间”，今后花费更多时间来讨论，对这项条约的反对意见也不会消除。他宣称：“现在已经是应使它在各议院通过的时候了。”
    岸信介还公然为声名狼借的美国间谍飞机打掩护。他硬说，驻在日本的U—2型飞机“在观测气象尤其是台风方面作出了很大贡献”。
    前已报道，日本气象厅次长多田寿夫13日曾经对“朝日新闻”记者说，日本气象厅从来没有接到来自U—2型飞机的气象情报。
    出席昨天的座谈会的社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎指出，通过U—2型飞机事件，很多日本人认识到美国在制造战争，越来越广泛的人民要求废除新“安全条约”。
    这位日本最大在野党领袖要求立即解散国会。
    他并且坚决表示，在国会会议的最后十天，社会党将全力为粉碎新“安全条约”而斗争。
