    A Just Struggle Cannot Be Suppressed
    By Our Commentator
    The American imperialism’s aggressive activities in various parts of the world, and its recent despicable act of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference, have ignited anger in the hearts of peace-loving people around the world. Recently, the Italian people, deeply harmed by the American aggressive policies, held a mass rally of 20,000 people in Bologna at the initiative of the Italian Communist Party to protest against American aggressive policies and the establishment of American military bases in Italy. However, this just and patriotic struggle of the Italian people has been met with a frantic suppression by the reactionary Italian government. On May 21st, the Italian authorities dispatched police to brutally beat the demonstrating masses, arrested Italian Communist Party member of parliament Pajetta and others, and killed thirteen people on the spot. This barbaric act of the reactionary Italian government cannot but arouse great indignation and protest from the people.
    When suppressing and arresting patriotic masses, the reactionary Italian government used the charges of "opposing the authorities" and so-called "insulting foreign leaders." This precisely exposes the true face of the Italian government as being subservient to American imperialism and betraying national interests. For a long time, due to the "loyal" pursuit of American aggressive policies by successive Christian Democratic governments, economic difficulties, peasant bankruptcies, and two million unemployed workers have been created domestically, leaving the people living in hunger and poverty. Abroad, Italy is increasingly losing its national independence. In particular, the reactionary Italian government's offering of its own territory to American imperialism to establish missile bases has put Italy in a dangerous abyss. Of course, no patriotic Italian people can tolerate such a traitorous policy. Therefore, the Italian people have been waging an unyielding struggle against this policy for a long time. However, the Italian Christian Democratic Party has consistently suppressed the people's patriotic actions, and the reactionary government's figures in power have even declared: They would rather have Italy suffer atomic destruction than have it ruled by "communists." Look, the reactionary rulers of Italy are so wholeheartedly willing to be slaves of American imperialism that they are absolutely unwilling to yield a step to the people. The bloody massacre in Bologna has educated the Italian people to further see the faces of the reactionary bourgeois government who are determined to be enemies of the people and betrayers of the country.
    Now, the incorrigible reactionary Italian government is even attempting to send the arrested communist members of parliament and other patriotic people to court. This reactionary measure has aroused the opposition of the broad masses of the people, and cries of "No persecution of patriots!" resound everywhere.
    It should be solemnly warned to American imperialism and the reactionary Italian government: Any bloody suppression cannot eliminate the people's patriotic and just struggle. On the contrary, it can only arouse greater anger and resistance from the people. Facts have already given the reactionary government a powerful answer. On May 22nd, thirty-five demonstrations were held throughout the city of Bologna. Mass rallies against war-mongers and against the establishment of American bases in Italy were also held in sixty-two cities across Italy. The flames of the people's struggle are raging fiercely throughout Italy.

    正义的斗争是镇压不了的
    本报评论员
    美国帝国主义在世界各地的侵略活动，以及最近破坏四国首脑会议的卑鄙行径，在世界爱好和平人民的心中燃起了怒火。最近，深受美国侵略政策祸害的意大利人民在意大利共产党倡议下于波伦亚城举行了两万人的群众大会，抗议美国侵略政策和美国在意大利建立军事基地。但是意大利人民这种正义的爱国斗争却受到了意大利反动政府的疯狂镇压。21日，意大利当局出动警察蛮横地殴打示威群众，逮捕了意大利共产党议员巴叶塔等人，并当场打死十三人。意大利反动政府这种野蛮的暴行不能不引起人们极大的愤慨和抗议。
    意大利反动政府在镇压和逮捕爱国群众的时候，用了什么“反对当局”和所谓“侮辱外国首脑”的罪名。而这正是暴露了意大利政府的投靠美国帝国主义和出卖民族利益的真面目。长期以来，由于历届天主教民主党政府“忠诚”地追随美国的侵略政策，在国内，造成经济困难、农民破产、二百万工人失业，使人民生活在饥饿和贫困之中。在国外，意大利越来越丧失自己的民族独立。特别是意大利反动政府拱手把自己的国土奉献给美帝国主义建立导弹基地，更使意大利面临危险的深渊。任何意大利爱国人民当然决不能容忍这种卖国政策。因此长期来意大利人民也一直为反对这种政策进行不屈的斗争。但是意大利天主教民主党却一直对人民的爱国行动横加镇压，反动政府的当权人物甚至还扬言：宁愿让意大利遭受原子毁灭，也不愿让它受“共产党统治”。看，意大利的反动统治者就是这样死心塌地甘为美国帝国主义的奴婢而绝对不肯对人民退让一步的。波伦亚的血腥屠杀，教育了意大利人民进一步看清了反动的资产阶级政府决心与人民为敌的卖国者的嘴脸。
    现在怙恶不悛的意大利反动政府，竟企图把逮捕的共产党议员和其他爱国人民送交法庭。这一反动措施，激起了广大人民的反对，“不许迫害爱国者”的呼声，响成一片。
    应该正告美帝国主义和意大利反动政府：任何血腥镇压，是消灭不了人民的爱国正义斗争的，相反的，只能引起人民更大的愤怒和反抗。事实已经给了反动政府一个强有力的回答。在22日，波伦亚全城举行了三十五次示威游行。意大利全国六十二个城市也举行了反对战争煽动者和反对美国在意大利设立基地的群众大会。人民斗争的怒火在意大利全国正在猛烈地燃烧起来。
