    Marching Towards Modern Science and Culture
    --Congratulating the Closing of the People's Liberation Army Cultural Education Activists Representative Assembly

    The People's Liberation Army's Cultural Education Activists Representative Assembly has closed. The conference reviewed the achievements of the army's cultural learning since the Great Leap Forward, exchanged experiences, rewarded advanced individuals, and established pacesetters for continued leaps forward. This will have a significant impact on further promoting the high tide of cultural learning in the People's Liberation Army, strengthening the modernization of the people's army, and promoting national economic and cultural construction.

    The People's Liberation Army is the builder and defender of China's socialist cause. It is a new type of people's army with communist ideals, educated by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. Paying attention to cultural education is its fine tradition and an important part of Comrade Mao Zedong's ideas on building the people's army. Everyone who joins the People's Liberation Army quickly improves their socialist and communist consciousness and continuously raises their scientific and cultural level. In this way, China's people's army has rapidly developed into a powerful force defending national security and the cause of peace. The People's Liberation Army is also a socialist university that cultivates talent for construction, continuously providing a large number of personnel with a certain level of scientific and cultural knowledge to the industrial and agricultural production and cultural construction fronts through demobilized and transferred cadres and soldiers. Since 1959, under the grand goal of popularizing secondary and higher education, the People's Liberation Army has launched a vigorous cultural learning movement throughout the army, bringing the cultural education work of the People's Liberation Army into a new stage. This movement has developed rapidly, achieved great results, and has been large-scale and continuous, greatly promoting the overall Great Leap Forward in various tasks of the troops, accelerating the revolutionization and modernization of the people's army, and creating rich experiences in political and ideological work, organizational leadership, teaching content, and other aspects. The cultural learning movement of the People's Liberation Army has become a torrent in the national cultural revolution.

    The People's Liberation Army launched the cultural learning movement while carrying out arduous tasks such as defending the motherland, modern military training, and supporting national construction. They mainly adopted the method of on-the-job spare-time learning, widely absorbing all comrades who could learn to participate in the learning, forming a large-scale mass movement. At the beginning of this movement, the People's Liberation Army implemented the Party's principle of proletarian politics taking command and adopted the mass line method. They first fully estimated the masses' great enthusiasm for learning modern science and culture, and at the same time, carried out in-depth ideological work. A grand discussion was launched among the vast number of officers and soldiers on "Do we need to learn?", "Can we learn on the job?", "Who do we rely on for learning?", and "What is the purpose of learning culture?". As a result of the discussion, the broad masses further clarified, based on the development of the national construction and army construction situation, that not only do we need to learn, but we must learn with the spirit of the Great Leap Forward; not only can we learn on the job, but we have sufficient conditions to learn well; learning cannot solely rely on leaders and teachers, but mainly on ourselves; learning is not for individuals, but for building and defending our great motherland. After these issues were resolved, a vigorous cultural learning movement was widely and deeply launched rapidly. In this movement, the People's Liberation Army, with its revolutionary fighting style and daring communist spirit, was not bound by the bourgeois teaching "order" that separates theory from practice, and constantly reformed the teaching content and teaching methods. At the same time, it also implemented a complete set of organizational leadership methods, such as focusing on on-the-job learning, supplemented by intensive training; unified leadership, with responsibility at different levels; and simultaneous development of large, medium, and small schools, achieving the goal of comprehensive mobilization and implementing a broad mass line. This has provided an important guarantee for the continued leap forward of the vigorous mass movement of cultural learning. Their experience is also of great reference significance for various places to launch a high tide of spare-time cultural learning for workers and staff.

    The cultural learning movement of the People's Liberation Army is an important part of the national socialist cultural revolution. Now, the people of the whole country are holding high the three red banners of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and are launching a continuous leap forward in socialist construction. Industry, agriculture, and scientific and cultural undertakings are developing rapidly. The faster China's socialist construction develops, the more it requires the People's Liberation Army to accelerate modernization. The People's Liberation Army should improve its modern scientific and cultural level more quickly in order to meet the requirements of national defense construction and national economic development. In terms of the international situation, the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong, and the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism is surging forward. US imperialism is the number one enemy of world peace. It still occupies our territory Taiwan and continues to threaten China with war. The People's Liberation Army must always be vigilant, closely watch the imperialist war conspiracies, and at the same time accelerate the improvement of its political, military, and modern scientific and cultural level, so as to better defend the socialist construction of the motherland, defend the security of the motherland, and defend world peace. It is hoped that all comrades in the army will continue to carry forward the revolutionary fighting style of continuous revolution, bravely climb the peak of modern science and culture, and work together with the people of the whole country, to build China into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern defense, and to strive to safeguard the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

    向现代科学文化大进军
    ——祝解放军文化教育积极分子代表大会闭幕
    人民解放军全军文化教育积极分子代表大会闭幕了。会议检阅了大跃进以来全军文化学习的成就，交流了经验，奖励了先进，树立了继续跃进的标兵，这对进一步促进解放军的文化学习高潮，加强人民军队的现代化建设和推动国家经济文化建设都将具有重要影响。
    人民解放军是我国社会主义事业的建设者和保卫者，它是在党和毛泽东同志的教导下，具有共产主义理想的新型人民军队。重视文化教育是它的优良传统，也是毛泽东同志关于人民军队建设的一个重要内容。凡是参加人民解放军的人，都迅速地提高了社会主义共产主义觉悟，并且不断地提高了科学文化水平。就这样，我国人民军队飞跃发展成为捍卫祖国安全和和平事业的强大力量。人民解放军同时还是一个培养建设人才的社会主义大学校，它通过复员转业的干部和士兵，为工农业生产和文化建设战线源源不断地输送了大量的具有一定科学文化水平的人员。1959年以来，人民解放军在普及中等和高等教育的宏伟目标下，全军更掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的文化学习运动，使人民解放军的文化教育工作进入了一个新的阶段。这个运动发展迅速，成绩很大，规模壮阔，持续不断，大大促进了部队各项工作的全面大跃进，加速了人民军队的革命化、现代化建设，并且在政治思想工作、组织领导、教学内容等方面，创造了丰富的经验。人民解放军的文化学习运动已经成为全国文化革命中的一支巨流。
    人民解放军是在执行着保卫祖国、现代化军事训练和支援国家建设等繁重的任务下，开展了文化学习运动的。他们主要是采取在职业余学习的办法，广泛地吸收了一切能够学习的同志参加学习，形成规模巨大的群众运动。人民解放军在开始这个运动的时候，就贯彻了党的无产阶级政治思想挂帅的原则，并且采取了群众路线的方法来进行。他们首先充分估计到了群众对学习现代科学文化的巨大热情，同时又进行了深入的思想工作。在广大官兵中开展了一个“需要不需要学”，“在职能不能学”，“学习依靠谁”，“学习文化的目的是为了什么”的大讨论。讨论的结果，广大群众依据国家建设和军队建设形势的发展进一步明确了不仅需要学，而且要以大跃进的精神学；不仅在职能够学，而且有充分的条件可以学好；学习不能单纯依靠领导，依靠教员，而是主要依靠自己；学习不是为了个人，而是为了建设和保卫我们伟大的祖国。当这些问题解决后，一个轰轰烈烈的文化学习运动便广泛深入地迅速掀起来了。在这个运动中，人民解放军以革命的战斗作风和敢想敢干的共产主义风格，不受资产阶级的那套理论同实践脱离的教学“秩序”的束缚，在教学内容和教学方法上，都进行了不断的改革。同时，还实行了以在职学习为主，集训为辅；统一领导，分级负责；大、中、小学并举等一整套组织领导办法，达到了全面动员，实行广泛的群众路线的目的，这就使轰轰烈烈的文化学习的群众运动，得到了持续跃进的重要保证。他们的经验，对于各地开展职工业余文化学习高潮，也有很大的参考意义。
    人民解放军的文化学习运动是全国社会主义文化革命的重要组成部分。现在全国人民正高举着党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗，掀起了社会主义建设的持续跃进的高潮。工业、农业和科学文化事业都在一日千里地发展，我国社会主义建设发展越快，越加要求人民解放军加速现代化建设。人民解放军应当更快地提高现代科学文化水平，才能适应国防建设和国家经济发展的要求。就国际形势来说，现在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量空前强大，世界人民反对帝国主义的斗争风起云涌。美帝国主义是世界和平的头号敌人，它现在仍然霸占着我国领土台湾，并且不断对我国进行战争威胁，人民解放军要时刻提高警惕，密切注视帝国主义的战争阴谋，同时要加速提高政治军事和现代科学文化水平，以便能更好地捍卫祖国社会主义建设，捍卫祖国安全和世界和平。希望全军同志继续发扬不断革命的战斗作风，奋勇攀登现代科学文化高峰，同全国人民一道，为在短时间内把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的强大的社会主义国家，为保卫亚洲和世界和平事业而奋斗。
