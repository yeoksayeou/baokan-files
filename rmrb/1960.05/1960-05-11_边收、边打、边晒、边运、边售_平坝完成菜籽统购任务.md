Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang: After achieving a bumper rapeseed harvest, the people of all ethnic groups in Pingba County, Guizhou Province, adhering to the principle of "country first, self second," completed the state-assigned rapeseed sales task for this year in a single push within just twelve days, exceeding the quota by 4.9%. The amount sold increased significantly compared to last year, and the quality met national standards.

This year, Pingba County achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of rapeseed. The Pingba County Party Committee fully utilized the experience of rapid autumn grain storage from last year, focusing on early, tight, and forceful action. As early as January, the County Party Committee led relevant departments to prepare for procurement. When rapeseed harvesting began, the County Party Committee simultaneously focused on spring plowing and production centered on combating drought and protecting seedlings, while also launching a mass movement to simultaneously harvest, thresh, dry, transport, and sell rapeseed. The county organized approximately nine hundred specialized harvesting, threshing, drying, and transporting teams, with 16,000 people participating. They implemented a "six-fixed" (fixed leadership, fixed labor, fixed harvesting area, fixed quality, fixed time, fixed remuneration) and "three-guarantee" (guaranteed harvesting, threshing, and drying; guaranteed storage; guaranteed work points) responsibility system. They also mobilized more than 3,500 handcarts, animal-drawn carts, and nearly 2,000 packhorses to participate in transportation. The county also organized nearly 4,000 cadres, school faculty and students, and factory and mine workers to help communes with rush harvesting and transporting. The grain department added thirty-seven procurement points, ensuring that there was a procurement point wherever there was a factory (oil press) or warehouse, which facilitated the masses and accelerated the rate of storage.

    平坝完成菜籽统购任务
    新华社贵阳电　贵州省平坝县各族人民获得油菜籽丰收以后，本着“先国家后自己”的原则，在短短十二天内，一鼓作气地超额4.9％完成了今年国家下达的油菜籽出售任务，出售的数量比去年增加很多，质量合乎国家规定标准。
    今年，平坝县油菜籽获得空前大丰收。中共平坝县委充分运用去年秋粮快速入仓的经验，抓早、抓紧、抓狠。早在1月份，县委便领导有关部门进行收购的准备工作。在油菜籽开始收割的时候，县委便一面抓以抗旱保苗为中心的春耕生产，一面大搞群众运动，对油菜籽实行边收边打边晒边运边售。全县组织了约九百个收打晒运专业队，有一万六千人参加，实行“六定”（定领导、定劳力、定收割面积、定质量、定时间、定报酬）、三包”（包收打晒、包入仓、包工分）的责任制，并且调集了三千五百多部人力车、畜力车和近两千匹驮马参加运输。全县还组织了机关、学校、厂矿职工、师生近四千人，帮助公社突击抢收、抢运。粮食部门增设了三十七个收购点，作到有厂（榨油厂）有仓就有收购点的要求，方便了群众，加快了入仓速度。
