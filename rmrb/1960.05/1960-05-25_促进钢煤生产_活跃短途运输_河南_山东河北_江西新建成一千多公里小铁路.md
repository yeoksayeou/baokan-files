Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 23rd May: From November of last year to the end of April this year, Henan Province has built a total of 703 kilometers of local railways, manufactured and modified 51 locomotives, and produced more than 2,780 carriages. Xinxiang Prefecture, with its faster progress, has built 438 kilometers of local railways, and basically achieved "mines connected to steel plants, coal mines connected to railway stations, railway stations connected to docks," and in-plant transportation track standardization for 55 factories and mines, 11 railway stations, and 5 shipping docks.

The completion and opening of these local railways has played a significant role in solving the problem of short-distance transportation and saving labor in the production bases of steel, coal, and timber. In the past, Jiaonan Steel Plant in Jiaozuo City had to use more than a dozen trucks and more than 200 flatbed carts, occupying more than 660 laborers, to transport ore from Hongshaling, which was 12 kilometers away, and the ore often could not be supplied in time. Now, with a local railway built between the factory and the mine, not only is the small blast furnace guaranteed to be fully fed, but there are also reserves, and the ore freight rate is also reduced by half compared to using rubber-wheeled carts.

In order to strengthen the leadership and management of local railways, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau has established a local railway division. Many prefectures and counties have also successively established management agencies for local railways.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd May: Shandong is accelerating the construction of a number of local railways, focusing on ensuring coal and steel production.

As of May 15th, the province has completed 366 kilometers of local railways this year. Together with those built last year, there are currently 420 kilometers of local railways open to traffic in the province. These local railways, which have been completed and opened to traffic, have played a huge role in solving short-distance transportation problems, especially in ensuring the normal production of steel and coking coal.

In the construction of local railways, the workers in various places have created many good experiences. The workers of the cement plant of the Linyi Prefectural Commissioner's Office Transportation Bureau have made more than 5,000 activated slag sleepers, which can save 370 cubic meters of wood. Zibo area has created "three-in-one soil integral roadbed" and ceramic sleepers to replace wood. These substitute sleepers have been tested on different lines and have good performance. The workers in charge of casting iron rails in various places have boldly created the experience of casting rails in front of the blast furnace. Using this method of rail casting can not only quickly and massively produce iron rails, but also save a lot of coke, manpower, and pig iron.

In accordance with the principle of attaching equal importance to construction, management, and use, various localities have established special management departments for local railways to uniformly direct the construction and use of local railways.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd May: Hebei Province has built 250 kilometers of local railways and small railways for reservoirs, factories, and mines.

The construction of these small modern and local railways has provided transportation capacity for factories and mines, ensured the needs of production, and created very good conditions for saving labor and animal power to support agricultural production and promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. For example, in the past, Gaobeidian Iron and Steel Plant mainly relied on trucks and horse-drawn carts to transport ore from Laishui. When encountering spring thawing and summer and autumn rainy seasons, transportation was often blocked, affecting blast furnace production. After the small modern railway from Gaobeidian to Laishui was opened, the amount of ore transported increased by two or three times, which not only ensured the normal production of the blast furnace, but also saved more than 140 horse-drawn carts to support agricultural production.

At present, Hebei Province has four more small modern and local railways under construction, with a total length of more than 170 kilometers.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 24th May: Jiangxi is stepping up the construction of small local railways. At present, the province has started construction of 42 local railways with 398 kilometers, and 11 lines (88 kilometers) have been completed and opened to traffic.

The construction of these railways has closely linked many steel plants, coal mines, and iron ore mines, and has powerfully promoted the leap forward in steel production. In the past, Tianhe Coal Mine often had more than 170,000 tons of coal stockpiled that could not be transported out. Now that the mine area railway has been built, the transportation efficiency within the mine has increased fourfold, which not only enables the stockpiled coal to be transported out in time, but also saves a large amount of labor.

    促进钢煤生产　活跃短途运输
    河南·山东河北·江西新建成一千多公里小铁路
    据新华社郑州23日电　河南省从去年11月到今年4月底，共已建成土铁路七百零三公里，制造和改制机车五十一台，车皮二千七百八十多辆。进度较快的新乡专区，就建成了土铁路四百三十八公里，并有五十五个厂矿、十一个火车站和五个航运码头基本上做到了“矿山通钢铁厂、煤矿通车站、车站通码头”和厂内运输轨道化。
    这些土铁路的建成通车，对解决钢铁、煤炭、木材等生产基地的短途运输和节约劳力的问题起了很大作用。焦作市焦南钢铁厂过去到十二公里以外的红沙岭运矿石，要用十几辆汽车，二百多辆平板车，占用劳力六百六十多人，矿石还往往不能及时供应。现在在工厂和矿山之间修通了一条土铁路，不仅保证了小高炉吃饱，而且还有储备，矿石运价也比用胶轮马车减少一半。
    为了加强土铁路的领导和管理，郑州铁路局已经成立地方铁路处。许多专区和县也陆续设立了地方铁路的管理机构。
    据新华社济南23日电　山东各地以保煤、保钢为中心，正在加速建设一批地方铁路。
    到5月15日止，全省今年已建成地方铁路三百六十六公里。连同去年建成的，目前全省通车的地方铁路已有四百二十公里。这些已经建成并通车的地方铁路，对解决短途运输问题，特别是保证钢铁、煤焦的正常生产，发挥了巨大作用。
    在地方铁路建设中，各地职工创造了许多好的经验。临沂专署交通局水泥厂的职工，制成五千多条活化矿渣轨枕，可以节约三百七十立方米木材。淄博地区创造了“三合土整体道床”和陶瓷轨枕等代替木材。这些代用轨枕，经过在不同线路上试验，性能良好。各地负担铸造铁轨的职工，大胆创造了高炉前铸轨的经验。运用这种方法铸轨，不仅可以迅速、大量地生产铁轨，而且可以节约大量的焦炭、人力和生铁。
    各地根据修建、管理、使用并重的原则，都相应地成立了地方铁路的专管部门，统一指挥地方铁路的建设和使用。
    据新华社天津23日电　河北省已经建成二百五十公里地方铁路及水库、厂矿小铁路。
    这些小洋铁路和土铁路的兴建，为工厂、矿山提供了运输能力，保证了生产的需要，并且为节省劳力、畜力支援农业生产，促进城乡物资交流创造了很好的条件。如高碑店炼铁厂过去从涞水运进矿石，主要靠汽车、马车运输，遇到春融翻浆和夏秋雨季，交通经常受阻，影响高炉生产。高碑店到涞水的小洋铁路修通以后，矿石运量增加两三倍，不仅保证了高炉的正常生产，还节省出一百四十多辆马车支援了农业生产。
    目前，河北省还有四条共长一百七十多公里的小洋铁路和土铁路正在施工。
    据新华社南昌24日电　江西各地正在加紧修建小土小洋地方铁路。目前全省动工修建的地方铁路已达四十二条、三百九十八公里，并有十一条（八十八公里）已经建成和通车。
    这些铁路的修建，使得许多钢铁厂、煤矿、铁矿山紧紧联结了起来，有力地促进了钢铁生产的跃进。天河煤矿过去经常积压十七万吨以上的煤炭运不出来，现在矿区铁路修成，矿内运输效率提高四倍，不但使积压的煤炭能及时运出，并节约了大批劳动力。（附图片）
