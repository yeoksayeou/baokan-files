Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 7th - Sources from the Jakarta Shipping Company said that a telegram received by the company on April 28th from Syahbandar, the head of the Port Authority of Selatpanjang, fully proves that the "Da Baokang" left Indonesia after completing all procedures. The telegram stated, "The 'Da Baokang' vessel arrived in Selatpanjang on April 24th and set sail for Huangpu, Guangzhou on April 27th, carrying seven hundred returned overseas Chinese."

The Jakarta Shipping Company is a state-owned Indonesian company that handles all matters concerning the arrival and departure of Chinese ships sent to pick up returning overseas Chinese at Indonesian ports. It does not have a branch in Selatpanjang, so it entrusted the local government's port authority to complete all procedures and shipping matters for the "Da Baokang" vessel, which was picking up overseas Chinese who had suffered in a fire, to return to China.

This news once again proves that the so-called "Chinese ship sent to pick up returning overseas Chinese fled Indonesian territorial waters" news released by the Indonesian Supreme Attorney General's Office is a complete fabrication.

    实叻班让港务局局长的电报证明
    “大宝康号”离港手续齐备
    印度尼西亚最高检察署发布的消息纯系捏造
    新华社雅加达7日电　雅加达轮船公司人士说，这家公司4月28日收到的实叻班让港务局局长斯亚班达的一分电报充分证明，“大宝康号”是在办完一切手续后才离开印度尼西亚的。这分电报说，“‘大宝康号’轮船4月24日到达实叻班让，4月27日启碇前往广州的黄埔，载有七百名华侨”。
    雅加达轮船公司是印度尼西亚的一家国营公司，它经办中国派去接运归国华侨船只抵达和离开印度尼西亚港口的一切事务。它在实叻班让没有分公司，所以它委托当地政府的港务局来完成接运遭遇火灾的华侨回国的“大宝康号”的一切手续和航运事项。
    这个消息再次证明，印度尼西亚最高检察署发布的所谓“中国派来接华侨回国的船逃出了印度尼西亚领海”的消息是彻头彻尾的捏造。
