Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Ankara: Following large-scale anti-government demonstrations in major cities such as Istanbul and Ankara, more than 300 students in Erzurum, a city in eastern Turkey, held a march and demonstration on the 7th to oppose the Menderes traitorous regime. They were subjected to brutal suppression by the army.

An atmosphere of imminent anti-government demonstrations still shrouds the Turkish capital, Ankara. Yesterday, people disregarded the ban of martial law and gathered on both sides of Atatürk Boulevard near the headquarters of the ruling Democratic Party.

To strengthen the suppression of possible popular demonstrations, the Menderes authorities have deployed more reinforcements to the capital. A report said, "At least thirty trucks loaded with fully armed soldiers were lined up on Atatürk Boulevard. The army also stood guard at various entrances to the street."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th dispatch: Seoul News: Students in various schools in South Korea continue to carry out demonstrations and strikes to expel US-Syngman Rhee agents and loyalists from schools.

According to reports, nearly a thousand students from Hanyang Industrial High School in Seoul demonstrated in Seoul's puppet "City Hall" Square today, demanding that the school's principal, US-Syngman Rhee agent Kim Yeon-jun, get out of the school. The new puppet authorities of South Korea sent troops to suppress the students and also fired tear gas.

According to the Toyo News Agency, the Gyeongsangnam-do puppet education authorities revealed on the 5th that students from five schools, including Gyeongnam High School, Gyeongnam Commercial High School, and Dongnae Middle School, jointly held a strike, demanding the resignation of principals and faculty members in these schools who colluded with the US-Syngman Rhee clique.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th dispatch: Many Indonesian university students and youths in Jakarta held a demonstration in front of the Dutch diplomatic mission in Indonesia this morning, protesting against the Dutch military exercises in West Irian and the deployment of more troops to West Irian.

The demonstrators wrote on the wall of the Dutch diplomatic mission: "Drive the Dutch out of West Irian!" "The Indonesian people are ready to meet the Dutch challenge!"

Then, the demonstrators shouted "Long live Indonesian independence!" and then loudly sang the Indonesian national anthem before leaving.

They distributed a statement to reporters. The statement said that the Dutch military exercises in West Irian are a threat to Indonesia and show that they are prepared to invade Indonesia. They lodged a serious protest against the Dutch colonial behavior.

Several hundred university students and youths also held a demonstration in front of another building of the Dutch diplomatic mission at the same time.

A spokesman for the Jakarta Army authorities said regarding this incident that the students' demonstrations were spontaneous actions. He also said that the authorities would summon certain student leaders. The Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed "regret" over the demonstration.
