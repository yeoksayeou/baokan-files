    Wheat Hundred-Grain Ears
    Three to Four Times More Grains Than Ordinary Wheat Ears
    The staff of the Agricultural Science Research Institute of Hetang Commune in Gutian County, Fujian Province, vigorously carried out agricultural scientific research. Using the advanced experience of cultivating "thousand-grain rice ears," they conducted a cultivation experiment of wheat hundred-grain ears.
    Recently, after inspection by the responsible comrades of the commune party committee and identification by the Gutian County Wheat High-Yield Observation Group, it was discovered that there were thirty-nine large wheat ears with more than one hundred grains. The largest ear had one hundred and twenty-one grains, and the general ears had about one hundred and ten grains, which is three to four times higher than ordinary wheat ears.
    The successful cultivation of wheat hundred-grain ears is of great significance for striving for high wheat yields.

    小麦百粒穗
    比一般麦穗粒多三四倍
    福建古田县鹤塘公社农业科学研究所的工作人员，大搞农业科学研究，运用培养水稻“千粒穗”的先进经验，进行了小麦百粒穗的培植试验。
    最近，经过公社党委负责同志的检查和县委小麦丰产观摩团的鉴定，发现小麦百粒以上的大穗有三十九穗，最大的一穗有一百二十一粒，一般的穗都在一百一十粒左右，比一般小麦穗粒高出三到四倍。
    培育小麦百粒穗成功，对争取小麦高产具有重大的意义。
