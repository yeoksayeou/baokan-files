Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th: The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs' Executive Committee decided at its emergency meeting today to launch a two-month movement starting June 1st, named the "Crush the New U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' and Prevent Japan's Nuclear Armament" movement, demanding the resignation en masse of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the cancellation of U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan. The meeting decided to make this movement a preparatory step for the Sixth World Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament, scheduled to be held in August this year.

    The Council's Executive Committee stipulated that the slogans of this movement would also include: "Immediately Dissolve the Diet," "Let us drive U-2 jet aircraft out of Japan," "We refuse to be accomplices to atomic war criminals."

    The Executive Committee meeting also heard preliminary reports on the marches that the Japanese people began on April 21st from the southern and northern ends of Japan. The preliminary report stated that a total of 2.2 million people have already participated in the marches. As of May 26th, the marchers starting from Okinawa Island have completed their route in Kyushu, and the marchers starting from Hokkaido have completed two-thirds of their route in Hokkaido.

    The report said that the marching队伍 included people from all walks of life, as well as many mayors, town heads, and village heads. The report said that in many places, the residents of entire towns and villages came out to welcome the marching队伍 passing through.

    Another report presented at the Executive Committee meeting stated that, to date, many letters have been received from countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, requesting to participate in the World Congress scheduled for August.

    The Executive Committee passed a letter to Eisenhower, requesting him to cancel his visit to Japan. The letter pointed out that it is now clear that the U.S. government supported the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet when it forcibly "passed" the revised U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives by relying on police violence.

    The letter stated, "The atomic bomb victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have already expressed their opinions on your (Eisenhower's) scheduled visit: if you cannot guarantee that you will sincerely strive to ban all nuclear weapons, they cannot welcome you. They also request that, if you still come to Japan, please first visit the monuments to the atomic bomb victims in Hiroshima and Nagasaki."

    The letter pointed out, "Your government has not yet formally apologized to the Japanese victims for the brutal atomic bombing of Japanese cities. Your government has not fulfilled this necessary prerequisite at all, yet it has forcibly concluded a new military alliance with Japan. This attitude of your government has caused the atomic bomb victims to feel serious dissatisfaction with your visit.

    要求岸信介下台　反对艾森豪威尔访日
    开展粉碎日美军事条约运动
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会作出决定
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会执行委员会在今天的紧急会议上决定，从6月1日起发起一个为期两个月的定名为粉碎新日美“安全条约”和阻止核武装日本的运动，要求岸信介内阁总辞职和取消美国总统艾森豪威尔对日本的访问。会议决定把这个运动作为预定在今年8月召开的第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的准备步骤。
    协议会执行委员会规定这个运动的口号还有：“立即解散国会”，“让我们把U—2型喷气式飞机赶出日本”，“我们拒绝成为原子战争罪犯的同谋者”。
    协议会执行委员会会议还听取了关于日本人民4月21日从日本的南端和北端出发游行的初步报告。初步报告说总共已经有二百二十万人参加了游行。在5月26日，从冲绳岛出发的游行者已经完成了他们的九州的路程，从北海道出发的游行者已走完了他们在北海道路程的三分之二。
    报告说，游行队伍中包括各阶层的人民，还有许多市长、町长和村长等。报告说，在不少地方，整个城镇和村庄的居民都出来欢迎经过那里的游行队伍。
    在执行委员会会议上发表的另一项报告说，到目前为止，已经收到亚洲、非洲、欧洲和美洲国家的许多来信，要求参加预定在8月举行的世界大会。
    执行委员会通过了给艾森豪威尔的信件，要求他取消对日本的访问。信中指出，现在很清楚，在岸信介内阁依靠警察暴力强行在众议院“通过”修改了的美日“安全条约”时，美国政府是支持岸信介内阁的。
    信中说，“广岛和长崎的原子弹受害者，已对你（艾森豪威尔）预定的访问表示了他们的意见：如果你不能保证你将真诚地努力禁止一切核武器，他们不能对你表示欢迎。他们还要求，如果你还是到日本来，请你首先访问广岛和长崎的原子弹死难者的纪念碑。”
    信中指出，“你的政府还没有对残暴地以原子弹轰炸日本城市一事正式向日本受害者道歉。你的政府根本没有履行这个必要的先决条件，就强行同日本缔结新军事同盟。你的政府的这种态度使原子弹受害者对你的访问感到严重的不满。
