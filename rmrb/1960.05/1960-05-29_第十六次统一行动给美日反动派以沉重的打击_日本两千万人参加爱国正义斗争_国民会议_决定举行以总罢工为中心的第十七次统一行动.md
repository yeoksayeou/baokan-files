Xinhua News Agency, May 28th dispatch from Tokyo: The sixteenth nationwide unified action against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," which began on May 9th, concluded on the 26th after achieving unprecedented success. The Japanese people, with firm determination and confidence, are preparing to launch the seventeenth nationwide unified action, supported by a general strike, to oppose this U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

During the Sixteenth Unified Action, a total of 20 million people participated in the struggle against the "Security Treaty" through various means such as strikes, rallies, and demonstrations. The number of participants was nearly three times that of the seven million who participated in the Fifteenth Unified Action. This unified action demonstrated the enormous development of the Japanese people's struggle against the United States and Kishi, striving for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality.

As of the 26th, 17 million signatures had been collected against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," and 15 million petitions and letters had been submitted to the Diet.

A prominent feature of the Sixteenth Unified Action was that the movement was more widespread and in-depth than in the past. The Japanese working class took the lead in launching large-scale strikes and rallies of millions of people in each action during the unified action period, becoming the main force in the unified action. The number of participants in the strikes far exceeded the number of strikes during previous unified action periods. The strikes received widespread support from other strata of the Japanese people. More and more farmers, intellectuals, housewives, religious figures, and small and medium-sized business owners participated in the nationwide unified action. In Gunma Prefecture and Hyogo Prefecture, nearly two thousand stores held strikes, which had not happened in the past.

Another feature of the Sixteenth Unified Action was that the struggle against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" further developed into a powerful movement to smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and demand the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet. Since the Kishi Nobusuke group used fascist violence on the 20th to forcibly "pass" the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in the House of Representatives, this struggle has become even more acute. Since that day, there has not been a day without large-scale mass demonstrations protesting Kishi Nobusuke's fascist atrocities and demanding the dissolution of the Diet and the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, many of which were held spontaneously. Some religious, youth, and women's groups that had never cared about "political struggles" in the past also joined the struggle this time.

In this unified action, the anti-American sentiment of the Japanese people was even higher. The U.S. U-2 spy plane's invasion of Soviet airspace and the U.S. sabotage of the Four-Power Summit aroused even greater indignation among the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism, making more people aware of the aggressive nature of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The Japanese people shouted the clear slogans of "Down with U.S. imperialism!" and "Yankees go home!" and held protest demonstrations in front of the U.S. Embassy every day. Demonstrators also strongly protested against U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan and demanded that the United States withdraw its U-2 spy planes from its bases in Japan. On the 26th alone, more than 90,000 people demonstrated at the U.S. Embassy.

The nationwide demonstrations held by the Chinese people in support of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic movement and the support of the people of North Korea, Vietnam, and other Asian countries for the Japanese people have brought great encouragement to the Japanese people. More and more people are beginning to understand that they are not isolated, but are fighting together with the people of China, North Korea, Vietnam, and other countries.

The heroic struggle of the South Korean people against the rule of the U.S.-Syngman Rhee clique has given the Japanese people new inspiration. "The South Korean people overthrew Syngman Rhee, we want to overthrow Kishi Nobusuke!" "Let us force Kishi Nobusuke to suffer the fate of Syngman Rhee," these slogans reflect the general sentiment of the Japanese people opposing the new "Security Treaty."

It was against this backdrop that the Japanese people held an unprecedented large-scale demonstration in Tokyo on the 26th. Two hundred thousand angry people surrounded the Diet until late at night. Kishi Nobusuke was besieged in the Diet Building for about nine hours, and only escaped home from a side door under the protection of a large number of police late at night.

The broad mass base of this large-scale demonstration has attracted special attention. The number of participants in the demonstration far exceeded the National Council's plan.

Even members of trade unions affiliated with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) held workplace rallies the day before the May 26th demonstration to oppose the "Security Treaty" and demand the dissolution of the Diet and the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan has taken a passive attitude toward opposing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" since the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law" two years ago.

During the Sixteenth National Unified Action against the "Security Treaty," the prestige of the "National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty," which led the unified struggle, was greatly strengthened. Under the leadership of the "National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty," the quality of unified actions involving people from all walks of life has improved. This has created conditions for the establishment of a genuine national democratic united front. In the hearts of the vast number of people, the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party are the leading forces in the people's struggle.

In contrast, Kishi Nobusuke and his followers are now completely isolated. Even bourgeois newspapers have recently published editorials calling for Kishi Nobusuke to step down.

The Japanese people's strong struggle has deepened the contradictions within the ruling group. Within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, the leaders of the anti-mainstream factions have begun to openly express dissatisfaction with Kishi Nobusuke's continued rule. They are taking active steps within the ruling party to overthrow Kishi Nobusuke, force Kishi Nobusuke to step down, and replace Kishi Nobusuke with other leaders from the ruling party.

The Sixteenth Unified Action of the Japanese people has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. The United Press International of the United States exclaimed that the large-scale demonstrations of the Japanese people "reached a terrible level." Japanese bourgeois newspapers said that the large-scale demonstrations of the Japanese people shook the earth like a tsunami.

The Japanese people believe that if they vigorously promote the next unified action, they can give a fatal blow to the rule of Kishi Nobusuke, the running dog of U.S. imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, May 28th dispatch from Tokyo: The Standing Committee of the Japanese "National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty" held a meeting today and decided to hold the Seventeenth National Unified Action from May 31st to June 10th to strive for the abolition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," force the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet to resign en masse, and dissolve the Diet.

At today's Standing Committee meeting, the National Council further specified the current struggle guidelines regarding the movement against the new "Security Treaty" that were adopted yesterday. The struggle guidelines adopted yesterday stipulate that a national general strike will be held on June 4th, along with rallies and various publicity activities.

Today's resolution of the National Council stated that on May 31st and June 1st, signatures will be collected nationwide against the new "Security Treaty" and demanding the dissolution of the Diet. On June 7th and 8th, a nationwide signature campaign will be launched.

According to today's resolution, from May 31st to June 3rd, continuous four-day protest demonstrations will be held in front of the official residence of Japanese traitor Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke. The demonstrations will be held under the leadership of the National Council.

The resolution stated that starting tomorrow, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Tokyo Regional Council, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Joint Struggle Conference for the Protection of Peace and Democracy will jointly launch a publicity campaign throughout Tokyo in order to mobilize Tokyo citizens to support the general strike scheduled for June 4th. In this publicity campaign, all the sound trucks of these groups will be mobilized to participate in the publicity. The resolution also called on all activists in the anti-"Security Treaty" movement to participate in the distribution of leaflets and signature campaigns during this period in order to gain broader public support for the planned general strike.

The National Council also decided to postpone the national conference originally scheduled for June 2nd in the struggle guidelines adopted yesterday and instead recommended that all member organizations belonging to the National Council hold many small meetings involving people from all walks of life on that day.

### 第十六次统一行动给美日反动派以沉重的打击  日本两千万人参加爱国正义斗争  “国民会议”决定举行以总罢工为中心的第十七次统一行动

    第十六次统一行动给美日反动派以沉重的打击
    日本两千万人参加爱国正义斗争
    “国民会议”决定举行以总罢工为中心的第十七次统一行动
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本人民从5月9日展开的第十六次反对日美“安全条约”全国统一行动在取得了空前的胜利以后已于26日结束。日本人民正以坚强的决心和信心，准备展开以工人总罢工为支柱的第十七次全国统一行动来反对这项日美军事同盟条约。
    在第十六次统一行动期间，共有二千万人以罢工、集会、示威游行等各种方式参加了反对“安全条约”的斗争，参加人数将近达到参加第十五次统一行动的七百万人的三倍。这次统一行动显示了日本人民反美反岸、争取独立、和平、民主、中立斗争的巨大发展。
    到26日为止，已经有一千七百万人签名反对批准新“安全条约”，交给国会的请愿书和信件已经达到一千五百万件。
    第十六次统一行动的显著特点是运动比过去更加广泛和深入。日本工人阶级在统一行动期间的每次行动中都率先展开声势浩大的数百万人的大罢工和集会，成为统一行动中的主力军。参加罢工的人数远远超过以前的统一行动期间的罢工人数。罢工得到日本其他阶层人民的广泛支持。越来越多的农民、知识分子、家庭妇女、宗教界人士、中小企业资本家参加了全国统一行动。在群马县、兵库县，将近两千家商店举行了罢市，这是过去所没有的。
    第十六次统一行动的另一个特点是，反对批准新“安全条约”的斗争进一步发展为粉碎日美军事同盟条约和要求岸信介内阁总辞职和解散国会的强大的运动。自从岸信介集团在20日施用法西斯暴力强使众议院“通过”日美军事同盟条约以后，这一斗争变得更加尖锐。从那一天起，没有一天不发生抗议岸信介法西斯暴行，要求解散国会和岸信介内阁辞职的大规模群众示威，其中许多示威是自发地举行的。一些过去从来不关心“政治斗争”的宗教、青年和妇女团体这次也投入斗争。
    在这次统一行动中，日本人民的反美情绪更加高涨。美国U—2型间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空事件以及美国破坏四国首脑会议的行为激起了日本人民对美帝国主义的更大愤慨，使更多的人认识了日美军事同盟条约的侵略本质。日本人民高呼着“打倒美帝国主义！”“美国佬滚出去！”的鲜明口号，每天到美国大使馆门前举行抗议示威。示威者还强烈抗议美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本，要求美国从日本的基地上撤走它的U—2型间谍飞机。在26日一天，向美国大使馆举行示威的群众就有九万人以上。
    中国人民为支持日本人民反美爱国运动而举行的全国性示威以及朝鲜、越南和其他亚洲国家人民对日本人民的声援给日本人民带来了莫大的鼓舞。越来越多的人民开始明白，他们并不是孤立的，而是同中国、朝鲜、越南等各国人民一起进行着斗争。
    南朝鲜人民反对美国——李承晚集团统治的英勇斗争给了日本人民新的启发。“南朝鲜人民推翻了李承晚，我们要打倒岸信介！”“让我们迫使岸信介遭受李承晚的命运”，这些口号，反映了反对新“安全条约”的日本人民的普遍的情绪。
    就是在这些背景下，日本人民26日在东京举行了日本历史上空前未有的大示威。二十万愤怒的群众包围了国会，一直到深夜。岸信介被围困在国会大厦里约达九小时，直到深夜才在大批警察保护下从便门逃回家去。
    这次大示威的群众基础的广泛引起人们特别的注意。参加示威的人数远远超过了国民会议的计划。
    甚至全日本工会会议（简称“全劳”）所属的工会会员也在5月26日大示威的前一天举行了工作场所大会，来反对“安全条约”，要求解散国会和岸信介内阁辞职。全日本工会会议自从两年前进行反对修改“警职法”斗争以来，对反对日美“安全条约”一直采取消极态度。
    在第十六次反对“安全条约”的全国统一行动期间，领导统一斗争的“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”的威信大大加强了。在“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”的领导下，有各阶层人民参加的统一行动的质量提高了。这样，为建立真正的全国民主统一阵线创造了条件。在广大人民的心目中，日本共产党和社会党是人民斗争的领导力量。
    与此相反，岸信介和他的追随者现在完全陷于孤立。甚至是资产阶级报纸也在最近连续发表社论，要求岸信介下台。
    日本人民的强有力的斗争加深了统治集团内部的矛盾。在执政党自由民主党内，反主流派的首脑们开始公开表示不满岸信介继续执政。他们在执政党内部采取积极的步骤打倒岸信介，逼使岸信介下台，而由执政党中别的首脑来代替岸信介。
    日本人民的第十六次统一行动已经给美日反动派以沉重的打击。美国的合众国际社惊呼日本人民的大示威“达到了可怕的程度”。日本资产阶级报纸说，日本人民的大示威像海啸一样震撼着大地。
    日本人民相信，如果有力地推行下一次统一行动，他们能够给予美帝国主义的走狗岸信介的统治以致命的打击。
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”干事会今天举行会议，决定在5月31日到6月10日举行第十七次全国统一行动，来争取废除新日美“安全条约”、迫使岸信介内阁总辞职和解散国会。
    国民会议在今天的干事会会议上对昨天通过的关于反对新“安全条约”运动的当前斗争方针作了进一步的规定。昨天通过的斗争方针规定，将在6月4日举行全国总罢工，并举行大会和各种宣传活动。
    国民会议今天的决议说，在5月31日和6月1日，将在全国征集反对新“安全条约”和要求解散国会的签名。在6月7日和8日两天，将发动全国性签名运动。
    根据今天的决议，从5月31日到6月3日，将在日本卖国首相岸信介的官邸前，连续举行四天的抗议示威。示威将在国民会议的领导下举行。
    决议说，从明天起，日本工会总评议会、东京地方评议会和东京都维护和平与民主共同斗争会议将在全东京联合发起宣传运动，以便动员东京市民支持定于6月4日举行的总罢工。在这个宣传运动中，将动员这些团体所有的全部装有扩音器的汽车参加宣传。决议还要求所有反对“安全条约”运动的活动家参加在这期间的分发传单和签名运动，以便争取更广泛的人民支持计划举行的总罢工。
    国民会议还决定把在昨天的斗争方针中规定在6月2日举行的全国大会推迟举行，而建议属于国民会议的所有会员组织在那一天举行许多小型的有各阶层人民参加的会议。
