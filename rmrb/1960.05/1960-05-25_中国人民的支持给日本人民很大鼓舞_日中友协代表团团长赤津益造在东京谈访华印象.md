    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd -- A delegation from the Japan-China Friendship Association, led by Akatsu Masuzo, returned to Japan by plane tonight after a month-long visit to China.

    Representatives from the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Overseas Chinese Association, and many other mass organizations were at the airport to welcome the delegation.

    In a speech to the crowd, delegation leader Akatsu Masuzo emphasized that he was deeply moved by the powerful demonstrations held by the Chinese people in support of the Japanese people's struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Akatsu Masuzo stressed, "It was a remarkable experience for us to be able to participate in several such demonstrations as representatives of the Japanese people."

    He also said, "We learned everywhere how angry the Chinese people are about the revival of Japanese militarism. At the same time, 650 million Chinese people, including Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong and every ordinary citizen, warmly support our struggle against the American imperialists and the Kishi Nobusuke clique. This gives us great encouragement."

    Akatsu Masuzo continued, "We had the honor of meeting Chairman Mao in Wuhan. He emphasized the importance of fighting against the true enemies of peace and not being deceived by the sweet words of the imperialists."

    新华社23日讯　东京消息：由赤津益造率领的日中友好协会访华代表团在中国作了一个月访问以后，今晚乘飞机回到日本。
    到机场欢迎代表团的有日中友好协会的代表、华侨总会的代表和其他许多群众团体的代表。
    代表团团长赤津益造在向群众讲话时强调说，中国人民举行的支持日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”斗争的强有力的示威使他深受感动。赤津益造着重指出，“我们能够作为日本人民的代表参加了几次这样的示威，对于我们来说，是了不起的体验。”
    他还说，“我们在各地都获悉，中国人民对于日本军国主义的复活是多么愤怒。与此同时，六亿五千万中国人，包括中国共产党主席毛泽东和任何一个普通市民在内都热烈支持我们反对美国帝国主义者和岸信介集团的斗争。这给我们很大的鼓舞。”
    赤津益造接着说，“我们在武汉荣幸地会见了毛主席。他着重指出了为反对和平的真正敌人而斗争、不被帝国主义者的甜言蜜语所欺骗的重要性。”
