    Henan Communes and Teams Establish Forest Farms
    With the rapid development of forestry construction, a mass movement to establish forest farms by communes and teams has been launched in various parts of Henan Province. Up to now, 1,324 commune-run forest farms and 17,517 team-run forest farms have been established throughout the province, basically achieving the goal of every commune and team having a forest farm.

    Water Control Tools Show Power in Agricultural Production
    The youth shock brigade led by Zhang Youdao, a famous water control model worker in Anhui Province, applied various water control tools to agricultural production in the fields. For example, wooden rails and earth-carrying vehicles used for water control were set up in the fields to transport fertilizer; derrick poles and aerial earth carriers were used to dig up pond mud and apply it to the fields. The CPC Suxian County Committee comprehensively promoted the experience of this team, enabling all 230,000 water control tools in the county to be used for agricultural production. In April alone, the county saved more than 1.4 million labor days.
    Cuona County, Tibet Strives for a Double Harvest of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
    After winning the victory of democratic reform, the farmers of Cuona County, located at the foot of the Himalayas in southern Tibet, grasped agriculture with one hand and animal husbandry with the other, launching a great production movement.
    The county's cultivated land area has now expanded from more than 4,000 *ke* last year to more than 9,000 *ke*. Due to large-scale water conservancy projects, 80% of the cultivated land can be irrigated. Each *ke* of land has generally been applied with 10,000 to 15,000 *jin* of base fertilizer.
    More than 20,000 sheep in the county have also achieved high yields. The lamb survival rate in each pasture is around 90%.
    Turning Barren Beaches into "Treasure Beaches"
    The Shangyou Commune in Hui'an County, Fujian Province, has transformed barren beaches into "treasure beaches." In the past year, the commune has developed more than 36,000 *mu* of beaches, established more than 8,000 *mu* of large salt farms, ten aquaculture farms, and three tidal power stations, and cultivated more than 8,000 *mu* of beach forests.

    A Large Number of Forest Chemical Plants in the Greater Khingan Mountains Put into Production
    The 416 forest chemical plants recently built in the Greater Khingan Mountains Forest Area of ​​Inner Mongolia have been put into production one after another. These factories currently mainly produce fiberboard, and also produce more than ten products such as tannin extract, activated carbon, rosin, birch bark oil, and calcium acetate.
    Corn Husks Have a Wide Range of Uses
    The starch pilot plant of the Lindian County Commercial Bureau in Heilongjiang Province uses corn husks (the outer layer of corn) to produce starch, fiber, and pulp, and uses corn husk starch to make various candies and pastries.
    In the past, corn husks were burned as firewood after the corn harvest in rural areas. In Lindian's vigorous efforts to comprehensively utilize local and special products, every part of the corn has become a treasure. The corn cobs after shelling are used to make furfural, and the residue is used to extract small amounts of ferrous sulfate and tar. From one hundred *jin* of corn husks, fifty-five *jin* of starch can be produced, and the by-products can be used as raw materials for fiber or pulp.
    Zhengzhou Manufactures Automatic Cotton Mixing Machine
    The Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory worked hard for twenty days and successfully trial-produced an automatic cotton mixing machine. The successful trial production of the automatic cotton mixing machine has fundamentally changed the heavy physical labor of cotton mixing workers in cotton mills, and has automated all processes such as manual opening of cotton bales, loosening cotton, and transportation. A factory with 100,000 spindles can save more than 30 cotton mixing workers.
