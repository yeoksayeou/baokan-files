    In the Dock
    Poem by Yuan Shuipai, Painting by Hua Junwu
    Plant melons and you get melons, plant beans and you get beans,
    Those who rob houses and steal are bandits,
    Those who pick pockets are thieves,
    Slipping into someone's doorway,—
    Be careful of your sinful black hands!
    To catch adulterers, catch them in the act, to catch thieves, catch them with the loot,
    The "meteorologist's" lady's ring,
    The "peace activist's" silent pistol,
    The Secretary of State's tongue tied in knots,
    The President's face with the powder falling off,—
    All presented to the court at once.
    Tuxedo, white gloves,
    Ideological crimes peeking out from the stiff collar:
    Imperialist aggressor, one culprit,
    Condemned by all!
    Who dares to be the enemy of the Chinese and Soviet people,
    Who dares to be the enemy of the people of the world,
    Who takes aggression as a national policy,
    Who takes being a running dog as a profession,
    Who must, before the people of the world,
    Mount the dock!

    被告席上
    袁水拍诗　华君武画种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆，打家劫舍的是强盗，摸人口袋的叫小偷，溜进人家大门口，——小心你罪恶的黑手！捉奸捉双，捉贼捉赃，“气象学家”的女式戒指，“和平人士”的无声手枪，国务卿打了结的舌头，大总统掉了粉的脸庞，——一古脑儿呈堂。大礼服，白手套，衬衫硬领里插犯条：帝国主义侵略罪魁一名，千夫所指不能饶！谁敢与中苏人民为敌，谁敢与世界人民为敌，谁把侵略作为国策，谁把当走狗作为职业，谁就要在世界人民面前，登上被告席！（附图片）
