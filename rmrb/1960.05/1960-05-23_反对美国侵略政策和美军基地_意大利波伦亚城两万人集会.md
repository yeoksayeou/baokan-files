Xinhua News Agency, Rome, May 22nd (TASS dispatch): A mass rally protesting against the US policy of aggression and the establishment of US military bases in Italy was held in Bologna, Italy on the 21st, at the initiative of the Italian Communist Party. Approximately 20,000 people participated in the rally. Italian Communist Party Central Committee member Pajetta spoke at the meeting, severely condemning the US spy flights over Soviet airspace. Speaking about the Italian government's foreign policy, Pajetta said that the Italian government is in effect an accomplice to US aggression against the Soviet Union.

Police officers demanded that Pajetta stop speaking, claiming that the speech was an "insult" to governments and countries that have friendly relations with Italy. He then ordered all participants to disperse. However, the crowd refused his order. The police then wielded batons to beat the crowd. The authorities also called in the fire brigade in an attempt to disperse the participants with water cannons. As a result, thirteen people were injured and ten were arrested.

The local organization of the Italian Communist Party issued a statement stating that the police action was a violation of freedom of speech. Transportation workers in Bologna held a protest strike yesterday, resulting in the suspension of tram and bus services throughout the city.

    反对美国侵略政策和美军基地
    意大利波伦亚城两万人集会
    新华社22日讯　塔斯社罗马讯：意大利波伦亚城21日在意大利共产党倡议下举行了抗议美国侵略政策和美国在意大利建立军事基地的群众大会。参加大会的大约有两万人。意大利共产党中央委员巴叶塔在会上讲话，他严厉谴责了美国飞机在苏联领空进行间谍飞行。巴叶塔在谈到意大利政府的外交政策时说，意大利政府实际上是美国对苏联侵略行动的帮凶。
    警官要求巴叶塔停止演说，说什么这种演说是对同意大利有友好关系的政府和国家的“侮辱”。接着他下令所有参加大会的人解散。但是群众拒绝了他的命令。于是警察就挥舞木棒殴打群众。当局还调来了消防队，企图用水龙冲散参加大会的人。结果有十三人受伤，十人被捕。
    意大利共产党当地组织为此发表声明指出，警察的这种行动是对言论自由的侵犯。波伦亚的运输工人昨天为此举行抗议罢工，结果全市电车和公共汽车运输都停止了。
