    Tokyo: 200,000 People Demonstrate, Surrounding the Diet
    Over 4 Million Workers Strike and Rally; Mass Meetings Held in Cities and Villages Nationwide
    On the 26th, the Japanese people launched a powerful unified action throughout the country, resolutely demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the dissolution of the Diet, and the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. More than 2,000 joint struggle organizations opposing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" held mass rallies in almost every city and village across the country. More than 4.5 million workers belonging to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and the Federation of Independent Unions (Churitsuroren) held strikes or workplace rallies across the country. In Tokyo, 200,000 people held a massive demonstration around the Diet. According to Radio Japan, the scale of this demonstration was unprecedented in Japan.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 26th: The Japanese people held an unprecedented large-scale demonstration around the Diet today, demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, and the abolition of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. By 9:00 PM, the number of demonstrators had reached 200,000, far exceeding the planned 150,000. NHK Radio said that the scale of this demonstration in Tokyo was unprecedented in Japan.
    The area near the Japanese Diet building was transformed into a sea of red flags and banners. Slogans of "Dissolve the Diet!" "Kishi Nobusuke Resign!" "The New Security Treaty is Invalid!" shook the sky. Banners held by demonstrators also read: "We oppose U.S. Imperialism!" "Yankees Go Home!"
    As demonstrators sat down on the spot, the streets and open spaces near the Diet were filled with demonstrators. Police forces were squeezed from the streets into the gardens of the Prime Minister's residence and inside the Diet walls. The traitorous Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke has been besieged in the Diet since this morning, and only slipped out through a side door at 10:30 PM.
    At 5:30 PM this afternoon, the leaders of the large-scale demonstration announced the start of a rally. Their headquarters was set up in front of the Diet gate. Communist Party Chairman Sanzo Nosaka and Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma spoke at the rally. The rally then passed the "Declaration Demanding the Resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Dissolution of the Diet" amidst a storm of enthusiastic applause.
    The declaration stated that we can no longer entrust the fate of Japan to the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. In the name of the people united around the "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," we demand: the immediate resignation of the Kishi cabinet, and the immediate dissolution of the Diet.
    The declaration stated that if Kishi Nobusuke clings to power and refuses to listen to the voice of the people, we will resolutely condemn him and further develop the movement against the "Security Treaty" until the Kishi cabinet falls.
    The declaration called on the Japanese people to participate in the movement to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and force the dissolution of the Diet.
    The declaration said that we will hold a general strike of all industries on June 4th to protest to the government.
    The declaration said that we will take continuous protest actions against the cabinet. We hereby declare that we will overthrow the Kishi cabinet, dissolve the Diet, and abolish the new "Security Treaty." We will concentrate all our efforts on this struggle.
    The rally passed resolutions protesting to Kishi Nobusuke and U.S. President Eisenhower.
    The resolution protesting to Eisenhower said: In the face of the Japanese people's protest struggle, the Kishi cabinet is about to collapse. Therefore, it is only natural that Eisenhower, who came to Japan to support the Kishi cabinet, will not be welcomed by the Japanese people.
    The resolution pointed out that Eisenhower's visit to Japan is clearly aimed at reorganizing the U.S. ruling system in the Far East after the failure of the Four-Power Summit and strengthening the alliance between the United States and Japanese militarists through the new "Security Treaty."
    The resolution stated that the Japanese people gathered around the "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" must once again declare their firm opposition to Eisenhower's visit to Japan, which aims to intensify the Cold War and support the militarists in strengthening their rule over Japan.
    The resolution demanded that the U.S. government cancel the U.S. President's planned visit to Japan, and demanded that the U.S. Congress not ratify the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
    Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzo Nosaka emphasized in his speech at the rally that the Japanese people should now make the general strike scheduled for June 4th a great victory.
    Sanzo Nosaka emphasized, "Today, we have in effect surrounded the Diet, opposing the ratification of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. To deal with our powerful action, the government has mobilized police forces. This shows how afraid Kishi Nobusuke is of our united action."
    Nosaka said, "We must further strengthen our propaganda movement among the farmers. Each of us must become a propagandist and organizer. Let us all collect 27 million signatures against the Security Treaty, demanding the dissolution of the Diet, thereby showing that the vast majority of qualified voters are on our side."
    Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma emphasized that the revised Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is the result of Kishi Nobusuke's deplorable policy of blindly obeying the United States.
    He said, "Kishi Nobusuke will sell the fresh blood of Japanese youth to the United States. Therefore, it is very natural for Japanese youth to rise up and stand at the forefront of the struggle of the entire Japanese people." Asanuma said, "The future belongs to the youth."
    Famous cultural figures such as Kiyoshi Aono, Etsuko Miyake, Tomoji Abe, and Takashi Asakura also spoke at the rally. They all expressed their determination to fight to the end with the workers and youth.
    Aono warned in his speech, "True fascism is now developing in Japan. We must extinguish it as soon as it rears its head."
    A farmers' representative from Hyakurigahara delivered a short speech, where farmers are struggling against the establishment of military bases in their villages. This farmer representative stated that the people in his village will resolutely fight until all U.S. military bases in Japan are abolished.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 26th, Tokyo: The Japanese people today launched a powerful unified action throughout the country, resolutely demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the dissolution of the Diet, and the total resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.
    Today is the last day of the sixteenth national unified action against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" that the Japanese people began on May 9th. More than 2,000 joint struggle organizations opposing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" began holding protest rallies in various places. According to Kyodo News, by around 10:00 AM, the number of participants in the rallies had reached 2 million. Currently, rallies are continuing in various locations.
    Today's unified action began with the power struggle of the workers. Government civil servants and employees of public utilities departments such as national railway workers, postal workers, and telecommunications workers held workplace rallies in various places. Unions of private enterprises, such as the Japan Coal Miners' Union, launched scheduled strikes.
    Tens of thousands of workers, students, civil servants, and people from all walks of life are currently gathering from all corners to Hibiya Park in Tokyo, preparing to hold a grand petition and demonstration march with 150,000 participants to the Diet starting at 3:00 PM this afternoon.
    After the march demonstrates and petitions to the Diet, the procession will split into two routes, going to Kishi Nobusuke's official residence, Kishi Nobusuke's private residence, and the U.S. Embassy to hold demonstrations, resolutely demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, the speedy dissolution of the Diet, and the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
    Currently, the unified actions of the people are still continuing.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 26th, Tokyo: Today, more than 4.5 million workers belonging to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and the Federation of Independent Unions (Churitsuroren) held strikes or workplace rallies across the country, resolutely demanding the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the immediate dissolution of the Diet, and the collective resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.
    Today's struggle by the workers is part of the sixteenth national unified action against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" led by the "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty." Today is the last day of this sixteenth unified action that began on the 9th.
    Government civil servants held protest rallies.
    The National Railway Workers' Union, the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union, the National Railway Locomotive Engineers' Union, and the All-Japan Electrical Communication Workers' Union held 30-minute workplace rallies during work hours.
    Teachers participating in the Japan Teachers' Union went on strike from teaching in all schools starting at 3:00 PM this afternoon, and held rallies.
    Workers in private enterprises also took unified action with workers in government agencies and public utilities departments. The Japan Coal Miners' Union, the National Metal Workers' Union, and the Taxi Drivers' Union held a one-hour strike.
    The Federation of Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Unions, the National Metal Workers' Union, the All-Japan Printing and Publishing Industry Workers' Unions, and the Chemical Workers' Union held a half-hour strike.
    Workers in other private enterprise unions belonging to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the Federation of Independent Unions held rallies in the workplace for 30 to 60 minutes. At all these workplace rallies, the workers passed resolutions demanding the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the collective resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and the immediate dissolution of the Diet.
    At the same time, a large number of workers, students, citizens, and farmers from neighboring prefectures began gathering near the Diet around 3:00 PM, and the number of demonstrators rapidly increased.
    Mass rallies against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" were held in Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, and almost all cities and villages throughout the country. (Attached Image)

    坚决要求废除日美军事条约解散国会推翻岸内阁
    东京二十万人大示威包围国会
    四百多万工人罢工集会　全国城市和村镇都举行群众大会
    日本人民于26日在全国各地展开强大的统一行动，坚决要求废除日美军事同盟条约、解散国会和岸信介内阁总辞职。全国二千多个反对日美“安全条约”的共同斗争组织在几乎全国所有的城市和村镇中举行了群众大会。日本工会总评议会和中立工会联合会所属的四百五十多万工人在全国各地举行罢工或工作场所大会。东京二十万人在国会周围举行了大示威。据日本广播电台说，这次大示威在日本是史无前例的。
    新华社26日讯　日本人民今天在国会周围举行规模空前的大示威，要求岸信介内阁下台、解散国会和废除日美军事同盟条约。到晚上九时，示威的人数已经达到二十万人，大大超过了预定十五万人示威的人数。日本广播协会电台说，东京这次大示威的规模在日本是史无前例的。
    日本国会大厦附近变成一片红旗、标语牌的海洋。“解散国会！”“岸信介辞职！”“新安全条约无效！”的口号声震天动地。示威者高举着的标语牌上还写道：“我们反对美帝国主义！”“美国佬滚回去！”
    由于示威者都就地坐下举行示威，国会附近的各街道和空地挤满了示威者。警察部队从街道上被挤入首相官邸的庭院和国会围墙里去。日本卖国首相岸信介从今天上午开始被围困在国会里，直到晚上十点半才从便门溜走。
    今天下午五时三十分，大示威的领导人宣布开始举行大会。他们的总部就设在国会大门面前。共产党主席野坂参三和社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎在大会上讲了话。大会然后在暴风雨般的热烈掌声中通过了“要求岸信介内阁辞职和解散国会的声明”。
    声明说，我们再也不能够把日本的命运交给岸信介内阁掌握。我们以团结在“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”周围的人民的名义要求：岸内阁立即辞职，立即解散国会。
    声明说，如果岸信介再死抱住政权不放，不倾听人民的声音，我们将坚决谴责他，并将进一步开展反对“安全条约”的运动，直到岸内阁倒台时为止。
    声明呼吁日本人民参加打倒岸信介内阁和迫使解散国会的运动。
    声明说，我们将在6月4日举行各行业的总罢工来向政府抗议。
    声明说，我们还将对内阁采取接连不断的抗议行动。我们在这里宣布，我们必将把岸内阁推翻，使国会解散，把新“安全条约”废除。我们将集中全力进行这场斗争。
    大会通过向岸信介和美国总统艾森豪威尔抗议的决议。
    向艾森豪威尔抗议的决议说：在日本人民的抗议斗争面前，岸内阁快要完蛋了。因此，要前来日本给岸内阁撑腰的艾森豪威尔不能受到日本人民的欢迎，这是理所当然的。
    决议指出，艾森豪威尔访问日本的目的显然在于重新整顿四国首脑会议未开成以后美国在远东的统治体系和通过新“安全条约”来加强美国同日本军国主义者的同盟。
    决议说，汇集在“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”周围的日本人民，要在此再一次表明，坚决反对目的在于加剧冷战和支援军国主义者加强统治日本的艾森豪威尔前来日本访问。
    决议要求美国政府取消美国总统访问日本的计划，并且要求美国国会不要批准新日美“安全条约”。
    日本共产党主席野坂参三在大会上讲话时强调指出，日本人民现在应该使预定在6月4日举行的总罢工取得巨大的胜利。
    野坂参三强调指出，“今天，我们已在实际上把国会包围起来，反对批准美日安全条约，为了对付我们的强大行动，政府动员了警察部队。这表明岸信介是怎样害怕我们的统一行动。”
    野坂说，“我们必须进一步加强我们在农民中的宣传运动。我们中间每一个人必须成为宣传员和组织者。让我们大家征集二千七百万个反对安全条约签名，要求解散国会，从而表明绝大多数有资格的选民都是站在我们这一边的。”
    日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎强调说，经过修改的日美“安全条约”是岸信介盲目听命于美国的可悲政策的结果。
    他说，“岸信介将把日本青年的鲜血出卖给美国。因此，日本青年奋起站在日本全体人民的斗争的前列，那是非常自然的事。”浅沼说，“未来是属于青年的。”
    在大会上讲话的还有青野季吉、三宅艳子、阿部知二和朝仓摄等文化界著名人士。他们都表示决心同工人和青年一起战斗到底。
    青野在讲话中警告说，“现在真正的法西斯主义正在日本发展。我们必须在它刚露头时就扑灭它。”
    百里原的农民代表发表了简短讲话，那里的农民正在为反对在自己村里建立军事基地而进行斗争。这位农民代表表明，他村里的人要坚决斗争到所有在日本的美国军事基地都被取消。
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本人民今天在全国各地展开强大的统一行动，坚决要求废除日美军事同盟条约、解散国会和岸信介内阁总辞职。
    今天是日本人民从5月9日开始的第十六次反对日美“安全条约”全国统一行动的最后一天。全国二千多个反对日美“安全条约”的共同斗争组织在各地开始举行抗议大会。据共同社报道，到上午十时许，参加各地大会的已经达到二百万人。目前，各地大会正在继续举行中。
    今天的统一行动是以工人的实力斗争开始的。政府公务人员和国营铁道工人、邮政职工、电信工人等公用事业部门的职工在各地举行了工作场所大会。日本煤矿工会等私营企业工会展开了定时罢工。
    成千成万的工人、学生、公务人员等各界人士，目前正在从各个角落向东京日比谷公园集合，准备从下午三点开始向国会举行共有十五万人参加的声势浩大的请愿和示威游行。
    游行队伍向国会示威请愿后，将分两路，到岸信介官邸、岸信介私人住宅和美国大使馆去举行示威，坚决要求岸信介内阁下台，迅速解散国会和废除新日美“安全条约”。
    现在，各地人民的统一行动仍在继续进行中。
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：今天日本工会总评议会和中立工会联合会所属的四百五十多万工人在全国各地举行罢工或工作场所大会，坚决要求废除新日美“安全条约”，立即解散国会和岸信介内阁全体辞职。
    工人们今天的斗争是“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”领导举行的第十六次反对新日美“安全条约”全国统一行动的一部分。今天是这次从9日开始的第十六次统一行动的最后一天。

    参加日本教职员工会的教员从下午三点钟开始在所有的学校中罢教，并且举行了大会。
    私营企业的工人也同政府机关和公用事业部门的工人采取一致行动。日本煤矿工会、全国金属工人工会、出租汽车司机工会举行了一小时的罢工。

    与此同时，大批工人、学生、市民和来自邻近各县的农民在下午三点左右开始集合在国会附近，示威者的数字迅速地增加。
