Guangdong Province's farmers are enthusiastically engaged in the early rice "surpassing contract" competition. The "three overtaking and three surpassing" competition movement, where mountainous areas overtake plains, lean fields overtake fertile fields, distant lands overtake nearby lands, and work exceeds quotas, quality exceeds standards, and measures exceed targets, has spread throughout the province.

According to Guangdong's production characteristics, the key to striving for high grain yields throughout the year lies in increasing early rice production. Traditionally, Guangdong's late rice production has been relatively stable, and yields have been higher; while early rice production has been relatively unstable, and yields have been lower. Therefore, various regions have put forward the slogan of "early rice overtaking late rice, surpassing late rice," and the province is vigorously carrying out an early rice high-yield campaign, focusing on lagging fields to achieve large-scale balanced yield increases in early rice. The Shantou area proposed to increase early rice yield by 100 jin per mu, and the entire area mobilized 70% of the labor force to invest in fertilizer accumulation and field management, resulting in large-scale field battles and cadre mobilizations everywhere, which greatly increased the progress of field management and fertilizer application. Chao'an County, a double-cropping rice thousand-jin county, has fertilized and weeded its early rice three times, with an average application of 150 dan of fertilizer per mu. The "three surpassing" mass movement of surpassing area, surpassing yield per unit, and surpassing high yield in the Shaoguan area has become a huge driving force for promoting the meticulous management of high-yield plots and attacking lagging crops among the broad masses of farmers.

This newspaper reports that over one million laborers in Anhui Province have shifted to field management.

Anhui Province has universally implemented the "five expansions" of production increase measures this year. Not only have more grain crops been planted during spring sowing, but various cash crops have also been expanded, and newly reclaimed wasteland and gaps have been widely utilized. Now, the early rice along the Yangtze River has been completely transplanted, cotton has exceeded the sowing task, and coarse grains such as sorghum and corn have also exceeded the sowing plan. Therefore, the task of field management is more arduous than in previous years.

After the spring-sown crops were planted, Party committees in various regions immediately organized inspection teams to conduct a comprehensive mass inspection, studying field management measures while inspecting. After the early rice transplanting was basically completed in the Wuhu area, a general inspection and registration was carried out plot by plot, ensuring that whatever was lacking was supplemented. More than 200,000 people in the entire area are participating in a "one liang of rice per plant, striving for a thousand jin per mu" bumper harvest campaign centered on field management. Seventy-eight thousand mu of rice fields with missing seedlings have now been replanted, and more than 150,000 mu of early rice have been fertilized and weeded. Various regions are also carrying out meticulous management of crops such as cotton, hemp, tobacco, and oilseeds, focusing on ensuring full stands and strong seedlings. After completing the cotton sowing task, various regions in the province immediately launched a seedling checking and replanting campaign with the goal of "no gaps for one chi in ten thousand mu, no missing plants in one thousand mu."

This newspaper reports that a new upsurge of the "three overtaking" summer production campaign has been launched in Jiangxi Province, with poor teams overtaking rich teams, mountainous areas overtaking plains, and low yields overtaking high yields.

In Jiangxi Province, 3,600 poor teams, while focusing on early rice field management to strive for high grain yields, are doing everything possible to expand the planting of cash crops in order to catch up with rich teams in terms of economic income. In Jishui County, 54 poor teams in various communes have fully launched a "ten planting" campaign. Commune members have comprehensively checked fields and reclaimed wasteland, planting large areas of jute, ramie, fruit trees, rapeseed, tung trees, medicinal herbs, mat grass, tobacco, melons, and beans, increasing the area of these ten crops by more than double compared to last year without affecting the area of grain crops. With the development of the expansion movement, a new scene of "mountains and fields covered in green, hundreds of crops filling the halls" has appeared everywhere in the poor teams.

In order to continue catching up with the plains in grain production, a large number of mountainous communes and teams are not letting up and are closely following. These areas are seizing both staple foods and coarse grains, building "corn mountains," "sweet potato mountains," and "sorghum mountains" to expand the area of coarse grains. They also proposed to take the meticulous farming of the plains as an example to ensure more and better planting. An'yuan County found that some early rice seedlings were slow to turn green due to low temperatures, and that the base fertilizer in some dry land converted into paddy fields was insufficient. Commune members immediately added warm and quick-acting fertilizers to the rice fields to promote the rapid greening and strengthening of the seedlings.

This newspaper reports that 115 state-run farms in Gansu are carrying out a heat wave of field management that focuses on water and fertilizer, while extensively reclaiming and planting wasteland.

According to statistics from various farms in Gansu Province as of May 20, newly reclaimed wasteland has reached 970,000 mu, one and a half times the total reclaimed area last year, of which more than 500,000 mu have been planted immediately after reclamation, accounting for more than 50% of the newly reclaimed wasteland.

This year, Gansu is experiencing a severe drought. Based on this situation, various reclamation areas have organized five teams for reclamation, leveling, canal construction and irrigation, fertilizer accumulation and application, and sowing to work together. Since the large-scale reclamation in February, the province has expanded the irrigated land area by 540,000 mu. More than 760,000 mu of newly reclaimed land and some land reclaimed last year have been irrigated by gravity flow and various water lifting tools, ensuring sufficient soil moisture for timely sowing. In the process of reclamation, sowing, and large-scale water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation and field management have been carried out simultaneously, changing the previous practice of "not applying fertilizer to wasteland in the same year." Each reclamation area utilizes local resources to dig pond mud and use grass skin to smoke fertilizer and create fertilizer. This year, the area fertilized during spring sowing in various farms across the province is generally between 80% and 90%. The land that has been sown across the province has been harrowed and rolled two or three times before and after sowing to conserve soil moisture.

    早稻赶晚稻　山区赶平原　低产赶高产
    广东  安徽  江西加强田间管理力争全面高产
    甘肃各国营农牧场加强新垦荒地田间管理
    本报讯　广东全省农民如火如荼地大闹早稻“超包产”竞赛运动。山区赶平原、瘦田赶肥田、远地赶近地和工作超定额、质量超标准、措施超指标的“三赶三超”竞赛运动遍及全省。
    根据广东的生产特点，要争取全年粮食高产，关键在于早稻增产。向来，广东的晚稻生产比较稳定，产量也较高；而早稻生产则比较不稳定，产量也较低。因此，各地提出了“早稻赶晚稻、超晚稻”的口号，全省迅猛地大搞早稻高产运动，大抓落后田，要早稻大面积平衡增产。汕头专区提出每亩早稻超产百斤，全区调集了70％的劳动力投放到积肥和田间管理战线上来，到处出现了田间大会战，干部大会师，使田间管理和积肥追肥进度猛增。双季稻千斤县潮安县的早稻已三次除草追肥，每亩平均追肥一百五十担。韶关专区超面积、超单产、超高产的“三超”群众运动，已经成为促进广大农民精心经营高产片，猛攻落后禾的巨大动力。
    本报讯　安徽全省已有一百多万劳力转入了田间管理。
    安徽省今年普遍推行了“五扩大”的增产措施，春播中不但粮食作物种植得多，各种经济作物也都有了扩大，并且新垦荒地和空隙地都广泛地被利用了起来。现在沿长江两岸的早稻已栽插完毕，棉花已超额完成播种任务，高粱、玉米等杂粮也已超额完成了播种计划，因此田间管理的任务比往年繁重。
    各地党委在春播作物一种下去以后，紧接着就组织检查组，开展了群众性的全面大检查，边检查边研究田间管理措施。芜湖专区在早稻栽秧基本结束以后，就普遍进行逐丘检查登记，做到缺什么补什么。全专区每天有二十多万人，投入了以田间管理为中心的“一棵一两稻，亩产夺千斤”的丰产运动，现已补齐了缺苗稻田七十八万亩，有十五万多亩早稻进行了追肥耘草。各地对棉、麻、烟、油料等作物，也围绕着全苗、壮苗进行着精细管理。全省各地在完成棉花播种任务以后，立即就开展了“万亩不断一尺垅，千亩不缺一株苗”的查苗补苗运动。
    本报讯　江西省掀起了穷队赶富队、山区赶平原、低产赶高产的夏季生产“三赶”新高潮。
    江西全省有三千六百个穷队，在大抓早稻田间管理争取粮食高产的同时，为了在经济收入方面赶上富队，千方百计扩种经济作物。吉水县各公社五十四个穷队全面展开了“十种”运动。社员在全面查田开荒，大种黄麻、苎麻、果树、油菜、油桐、药材、席草、烟叶、瓜、豆，已使十项作物在不影响粮食面积的前提下，比去年扩大了一倍多。随着扩种运动的开展，各地穷队到处出现一片“山上田野遍地绿，百样作物满堂红”的新局面。
    大批山区社、队为使粮食生产继续赶平原，一着不让，步步紧追。这些地区一手抓主粮，一手抓杂粮，大建玉米山、红薯山、高粱山扩大杂粮面积。还提出以平原区精耕细管作样子，保证多种、种好。安远县发现部分早稻禾苗因气温低返青慢，部分旱地改成的水田底肥不足，社员们立即动手为稻田大加暖性速效肥料，促使禾苗迅速转青壮发。
    本报讯　甘肃一百十五个国营农牧场，在大量垦荒播种的同时，开展了一个抓水、肥的田间管理的热潮。
    甘肃省各个农牧场截至5月20日统计，新垦荒地已达九十七万亩，为去年垦荒总面积的一倍半，其中随垦随种五十多万亩，占新垦荒地的50％以上。
    今年甘肃干旱十分严重，各垦区根据这一情况，组织了垦荒、平地、修渠灌水、积肥施肥、播种五路梯队，联合作业。全省从2月大量垦荒以来，共扩大水地面积五十四万亩，有七十六万多亩新垦地和部分去年开垦的土地，已采用自流和利用各种提水工具进行了灌溉，保证了地墒充足，适时播种。在垦荒播种、大抓水利的过程中，积肥和田间管理同时赶了上去，改变了过去“当年荒地不施肥”的常规。各垦区因地制宜的挖池泥、就地利用草皮熏肥造肥。全省各农牧场今年春播施肥面积一般在80％—90％之间。全省已播种的土地都在播种前后进行了两、三次耙耱保墒工作。
