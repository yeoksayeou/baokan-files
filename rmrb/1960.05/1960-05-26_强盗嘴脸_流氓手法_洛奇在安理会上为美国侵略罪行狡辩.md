Bandit's Visage, Thug's Tactics
Lodge Attempts to Justify US Aggression in the UN Security Council
Shamelessly Denies Provocative Crimes
    After Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko sternly condemned US aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union at the United Nations Security Council on the 23rd, US representative Lodge gave a reply. Lodge's speech once again vividly displayed the bandit-like face of US imperialism.
    Lodge appeared as a rogue. Even after the US government had repeatedly officially admitted that the US U-2 plane that intruded into Soviet airspace was for intelligence gathering, Lodge shamelessly said this time that it was "a harmless observation flight," and that this US plane going so deep into Soviet territory was "not aggression."
    Barbarically Shouts to Continue Aggression
    Lodge appeared as a barbarian. He reiterated Eisenhower's statement in Paris, clamoring that the US taking such espionage flight measures that violate the airspace of socialist countries was "necessary" and that the US would not evade "its own responsibility." Lodge even openly threatened that only if the Soviet Union was willing to "negotiate a treaty of open skies," could it "eliminate the necessity (for the US) to take such self-defense measures." This means that if the Soviet Union does not agree to open its skies to US aerial bandits, they will continue their bandit activities. In fact, this is exactly the position that the US government has publicly announced: conducting such aerial bandit activities remains the US government's unchangeable "established policy."
    Hypocritically Promotes Peace Deception
    While putting on a rogue and barbaric face, Lodge did not forget to pretend to be another hypocritical face to deceive. He said something like "the US is still wholeheartedly trying to solve international problems through negotiation rather than through force"; but is not the US's attempt to realize "open skies" and other schemes to legitimize US aggression plans enough to show what kind of "peace negotiations" the US is wholeheartedly pursuing? Lodge also promoted that Eisenhower said in Paris that he would not resume US spy plane flights into Soviet airspace; however, this deception was also exposed by Eisenhower himself in Paris long ago. Eisenhower only promised to do so in the short few months he remains as US President, and after that he can do whatever he wants. According to a report by United Press International, US officials, in providing the background for the suspension of U-2 flights over the Soviet Union, also explained that this was because "the Russians now understand its bases, flight capabilities, and many other flight elements," and this reconnaissance plane has become a "worthless agent," and "the US will have to abandon this flight whether it wants to or not." It can be seen that this is only a redeployment after a means of "special, secret" "underground activities" that Eisenhower has tried his best to promote has been exposed. The entire espionage and sabotage activities carried out by the United States against socialist countries using various means have not been relaxed at all. US Secretary of the Army Bruck publicly stated on the 21st that their espionage activities are continuing unaffected.
    Evades Condemnation and Conceals Numerous Crimes
    In Lodge's speech, he attempted to reduce the entire issue to just one US U-2 plane incident. However, the matter cannot be reduced. Not only is the nature of this deliberate US provocation against the Soviet Union on the eve of the scheduled Four-Power Summit itself outrageous, but such events are far from unique. Even from the aspect of sending planes to violate the airspace of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries alone, US imperialism has consistently done so. An article published in the Soviet "Pravda" on the 20th listed a large number of factual materials in this regard. From 1953 to 1956 alone, US planes violated Soviet airspace more than one hundred times. After this US spy plane incident was exposed, US Vice President Nixon and Secretary of State Herter admitted one after another that U-2 planes have been conducting espionage flights to collect intelligence for the past four years.
    Facts Are All There, Lies Cannot Deceive People
    The consistent and large-scale violation of the airspace of socialist countries by US planes is certainly not the result of a sudden outbreak of warmongering by certain people or a certain department in Washington. US authorities pointed out that this has always been implemented according to an aerial reconnaissance plan formulated under the personal order of the US President. Obviously, this plan is an integral part of US imperialism's entire policy of aggression and war, and a link in the US's preparations for aggressive war deployments. No matter how Lodge says that US spy plane flights are "self-defense measures" and "have no intention of aggression," this set of lies cannot deceive people. Not long ago, US Strategic Air Command Commander Powell, in a book advocating "preemptive war," said that if the US wants to launch a war, it must obtain certain intelligence. US Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army Becker said at the Army Association's annual meeting that the US war plan requires "quickly finding the enemy's targets and destroying them." Isn't the US spy plane's in-depth incursion into socialist countries to steal intelligence on military and industrial targets and so on preparing for a sudden aggressive attack? Through this incident of the US using overseas bases to conduct U-2 plane espionage flights, it once again irrefutably proves that the US has established a network of hundreds of military bases in seventy countries and regions around the world as a deployment to prepare for aggressive wars, and these countries with US bases face the danger of being dragged into war by the US at any time.
    Eisenhower recently bluntly stated that since he began his tenure in 1953, he has instructed to carry out all intelligence gathering measures, including aerial bandit flights, and this "established policy" has been implemented. This shows that whether it was the period more than a year ago when Eisenhower and Dulles publicly promoted the "massive retaliation" and "brink of war" policies, or the period in the past year when Eisenhower talked about "peaceful intentions" in his mouth, the aggressive and war policies pursued by the Eisenhower administration have not changed at all. The only difference is that in the past year, the US's methods have become more insidious, intensifying preparations for new aggressive wars under the guise of peace, attempting to deceive the eyes of peace-loving people all over the world. And this US provocation against the Soviet Union, as well as the destruction of the Four-Power Summit, has stripped the US of its peace mask.
    Faced with the tide of protests from people all over the world, Eisenhower in Paris a few days ago and Lodge at the United Nations are still stubbornly insisting on continuing to implement their "established policies." This will only make the people of all countries see more clearly that the nature of imperialist aggression and war will not change.

### 强盗嘴脸  流氓手法  洛奇在安理会上为美国侵略罪行狡辩

    强盗嘴脸  流氓手法
    洛奇在安理会上为美国侵略罪行狡辩
    恬不知耻抵赖挑衅罪行
    在23日联合国安全理事会上，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯严正谴责美国对苏联的侵略和挑衅以后，美国代表洛奇作了答辩。洛奇的发言，又一次活现出美帝国主义者的强盗嘴脸。
    洛奇是一副无赖相。甚至在美国政府多次正式声明里供认侵入苏联领空的美国U—2飞机是为了搜集情报以后，洛奇这次还恬不知耻地说，这是“一次无害的观察飞行”，这种美国飞机如此深入苏联境内也“不是侵略”。
    蛮横无理叫嚷继续侵略
    洛奇是一副蛮横相。他重申艾森豪威尔在巴黎的声明，叫嚷美国采取这种侵犯社会主义国家领空的间谍飞行措施是“必要”的，美国不会规避“自己的责任”。洛奇并且公然威胁，只有苏联愿意“谈判缔结一项开放天空条约”，才能“消除（美国）采取这种自卫措施的必要性”。这就是说，如果苏联不同意向美国空中强盗开放天空，他们就要继续进行强盗活动。实际上，这正是美国政府已经公开宣布的立场：进行这样空中强盗活动，仍是美国政府不可改变的“既定政策”。
    假仁假义宣扬和平骗局
    洛奇在耍一副无赖和蛮横相的同时，没有忘记装作另一副伪善相，来进行欺骗。他说什么“美国仍然一心设法通过谈判而不是通过武力来解决国际问题”；但是，美国设法通过谈判实现“开放天空”之类使美国侵略阴谋合法化的盘算，难道不足以说明美国一心追求的原来是什么样的“和平谈判”吗？洛奇还宣传，艾森豪威尔在巴黎说将不恢复美国间谍飞机侵入苏联领空的飞行；但是，这个骗局也早由艾森豪威尔自己在巴黎揭穿了。艾森豪威尔只答应在他留任美国总统的今后短短几个月内如此，以后便可以为所欲为。据合众国际社报道，美国官员在提供暂停U—2飞机对苏联飞行的背景时，还解释道，这是因为“俄国人现在了解了它的基地、飞行能力和许多其他的飞行要素”，这种侦察飞机已成了“分文不值的代理人”，
  “不论美国想要还是不想要，都将不得不放弃这种飞行”。可见，这只是艾森豪威尔竭力推崇的“特殊的、秘密的”一种“地下活动”手段败露后进行的重新部署而已。美国使用各种各样手段对社会主义国家进行的整个间谍破坏活动丝毫也没有放松，美国陆军部长布鲁克21日公开声称，他们的间谍活动不受影响地在继续进行。
    逃避谴责掩饰累累罪迹
    洛奇发言中，企图把整个问题缩小成只是一架美国U—2飞机事件。然而，事情是缩小不了的。不仅是这次美国蓄意在原定四国政府首脑会议前夕对苏联挑衅事件本身的猖狂性质，而且这样的事件远不是绝无仅有的。即从派遣飞机侵犯苏联和其他社会主义国家领空这一个方面来说，美帝国主义便是一贯这样做的。苏联“真理报”20日发表的文章，列举了这方面的大量事实材料。仅从1953年到1956年间，美国飞机就曾侵犯苏联领空一百多次。在这次美国间谍飞机事件被揭发后，美国副总统尼克松和国务卿赫脱纷纷承认，最近四年来U—2飞机一直在进行收集情报的间谍飞行。
    事实俱在谎话骗不了人
    美国飞机一贯地、大量地侵犯社会主义国家领空，当然决不是华盛顿某些人或者某一部门偶然发作好战狂热的结果。美国当局指出，这一直是根据美国总统亲自命令制订的空中侦察计划执行的。很明显，这个计划是美帝国主义整个侵略和战争政策里的一个组成部分，是美国准备侵略战争部署里的一个环节。不管洛奇怎样说美国间谍飞机飞行是“自卫措施”，“没有侵略的意图”，这套谎话是骗不了人的。不久前，美国现任战略空军司令鲍威尔在一本鼓吹“先发制人战争”的著作里说，美国要发动战争，就必须获得某些情报。美国陆军副参谋长贝克尔在陆军协会年会上说，美国的战争计划要求“迅速找出敌人的目标并且加以摧毁”。美国间谍飞机深入社会主义国家境内窃取军事、工业目标等等的情报，不正是在准备着突然侵略袭击吗？通过这次美国利用海外基地进行U—2飞机间谍飞行事件，又一次无可辩驳地证明，美国在全世界七十个国家和地区建立几百个军事基地网，是一种准备侵略战争的部署，这些设有美国基地的国家面临随时可能被美国拖入战火的危险。
    艾森豪威尔最近直言不讳，他从1953年开始执政后，便指示进行包括空中强盗飞行在内的一切搜集情报措施，这种“既定政策”一直在贯彻着。这表明，不论是一年多前艾森豪威尔同杜勒斯一道公开推行“大规模报复”、“战争边缘”政策的时期，还是近一年来艾森豪威尔嘴里高谈“和平意图”的时期，艾森豪威尔政府奉行的侵略和战争政策是丝毫也没有改变的。不同的仅仅是，近一年来，美国的手法更加阴险，是在和平幌子下加紧准备新的侵略战争，企图以此蒙蔽全世界爱好和平人民的眼睛。而美国这次对苏联的挑衅，以及对四国政府首脑会议的破坏，却把美国的和平伪装剥得精光了。
    面对着全世界各国人民的抗议怒潮，几天前艾森豪威尔在巴黎，目前洛奇在联合国，依然顽固地坚持继续执行他们的“既定政策”，这只会使得各国人民更加看清楚，帝国主义侵略和战争的本性是不会改变的。
