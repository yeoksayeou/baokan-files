Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. Shanghai's schools at all levels and of all types are vigorously promoting audiovisual education, which has played a very good role in improving teaching quality and developing education.

Due to the great development of education, especially the development of spare-time education, the existing teaching force and teaching forms cannot fully adapt to the needs of the current situation. In addition, after the in-depth development of teaching reform, schools at all levels and of all types have increased a large number of textbooks reflecting modern scientific knowledge, requiring new teaching tools and teaching equipment. Therefore, audiovisual education has been vigorously promoted.

In the context of the rapid development of education, insufficient teaching staff, and uneven levels, using television, radio, and lecturing machines to give lectures can replace some teachers. For example, the existing radio schools and television universities have more than 26,000 students, but only 20 teachers. Recently, the China Record Factory has produced a lecturing machine that combines slides and microgroove records, which is even more convenient to use. The content of the lectures is recorded on records, and important experiments and calculations are made into slides. When class begins, they are played, which is clear to hear and can be used to view teaching activities. It is also free from restrictions on time, place, and the number of listeners.

In many schools, some abstract content that is difficult to express in language is filmed into slides and movies, and projected in conjunction with teachers' lectures, playing a role in intuitive teaching, making it easier for students to understand the content of the lectures. For example, in the junior high school chemistry class, the electrolysis process is invisible to the naked eye. Now it has been made into a slide through a magnifying glass. At a glance, students can understand it without the need for much explanation from the teacher. The use of audiovisual teaching aids also greatly shortens unnecessary repetition and auxiliary activity time in lectures. In the chapter on thermal molecular motion in ordinary physics taught at Jiaotong University, students saw the relationship between intermolecular forces from movies and slides. The lecture that originally took 80 minutes to deliver can now be completed in 35 minutes.

The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to audiovisual education, and has recently established an Audiovisual Education Committee including educational units and audiovisual teaching equipment production units, to be responsible for leading audiovisual education work. Audiovisual teaching groups have also been established in schools at all levels and of all types.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou. Guangzhou's universities are self-reliantly innovating teaching equipment, and have manufactured a large number of experimental instruments, and expanded and newly built a number of laboratories and experimental factories.

Some young teachers and first-year students from the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of Zhongshan University spent 38 days building a mathematics and mechanics laboratory. With this laboratory, favorable conditions have been created for mathematics to connect with practice and production. The newly established Guangzhou Railway Institute recently self-made 64 sets of experimental instruments, 233 teaching models, and more than 560 teaching charts, and established four laboratories, including physics, from scratch, so that experimental courses in various subjects can be carried out smoothly.

In the process of vigorously developing teaching equipment, teachers and students of various schools have demonstrated the spirit of daring to think and act and collectivism. The six laboratories of the Department of Electrical Engineering of the South China Institute of Technology were built by relying on 180 first-year students. Before the establishment of the laboratory, they could not understand circuit diagrams. But after a week of basic training, they were able to boldly design and arrange parts according to the circuit diagram, and excellently complete the rather complex instrument installation.

    上海各校师生大搞电化教学
    广州高等学校积极革新教学设备
    据新华社上海电　上海市各级各类学校大搞电化教学，对提高教学质量和发展教育事业起了很好的作用。
    由于教育工作大发展，特别是业余教育的发展，现有的教学力量，教学形式不能完全适应目前形势发展的需要，另外，教学改革深入展开以后，各级各类学校都增加了大量反映现代科学知识的教材，要求有新的教学工具、教学设备。因而，电化教学得到了大力推行。
    在教育工作飞跃发展、师资不足、水平不齐的情况下，利用电视、广播、讲课机讲课，就可以代替一部分教师讲课。如已经兴办的广播学校、电视大学，学生有二万六千多人，而教师则只有二十人。最近，中国唱片厂制成了幻灯和密纹唱片相配合的讲课机，使用起来就更方便了。把讲课的内容灌成唱片，把重要的实验、演算制成幻灯片，上课时就放，既能听得清晰，又能看到教学活动，而且可以不受时间、地点和听课人数的限制。
    许多学校在讲课中，把一些抽象的、不易用语言表达的内容，拍成幻灯片、电影，配合教师讲授放映，起直观教学的作用，使学生更容易理解讲课的内容。如初中化学课中讲的电解，电解过程是肉眼看不见的，现在通过放大镜制成了幻灯片，学生一看，一目了然，不用教师多讲就懂了。使用电化教具，也大大缩短了讲课中不必要的重复和辅助活动时间。交通大学讲授的普通物理热分子运动一章，学生从电影、幻灯片上看到了分子间作用的关系，原来需要八十分钟讲的课，现在三十五分钟就讲完了。
    中共上海市委极为重视电化教育，最近已成立了包括教育单位、电化教具生产单位的电化教育委员会，负责领导电化教育工作。各级各类学校也成立了电化教学小组。
    据新华社广州电　广州各高等学校自力更生地革新教学设备，已经制造出了大批实验仪器，扩建和新建了一批实验室和实验工厂。
    中山大学数学力学系一些青年教师和部分一年级学生，用三十八天时间建成一个数学力学实验室。有了这个实验室，为数学联系实际、联系生产创造了有利条件。新办的广州铁道学院，不久前自制了实验仪器六十四套，教学模型二百三十三件，教学挂图五百六十多张，从无到有地建立了物理等四个实验室，使各科实验课能够顺利进行。
    在大搞教学设备的过程中，各校师生发挥了敢想敢干和集体主义的精神。华南工学院电工系的六个实验室，就是依靠一年级一百八十个学生建成的。在建立实验室之前，他们都还看不懂线路图。但是经过一个星期的基本训练后，他们就能大胆地按照线路图设计零件布置，出色地完成了相当复杂的仪器装置。
