    The ranks grow longer

    Mount Fuji erupts with angry flames, and inspiring news of the Japanese people's heroic struggle arrives daily. Under the clear banner of opposing U.S. imperialism and its running dog, Nobusuke Kishi, more and more people have taken to the streets. Angry people are rallying, signing petitions, demonstrating, marching..., people arm in arm, facing the shameless attacks of military horses, police batons, and water cannons,冲向冲向东京,冲向国会,冲向岸信介政府的门前[TN: repeated "chongxiang" in original, meaning "rushing toward," has been removed for clarity and replaced with a single "rushing towards"]. This is an unprecedentedly large-scale unified action by the Japanese people, and the shouts of protest are getting louder and louder. In fact, ever since the plague god America came to Japan, when have the Japanese people ever stopped cursing and fighting against the plague god!
    We have constantly read news in the newspapers about the Japanese people's struggle for independence, freedom, and democracy. We have also seen many pictures showing the Japanese people's spirit and strength in struggle. The massive scenes of the masses, the white-haired old men being helped to participate in demonstrations, and the young students being beaten and rounded up by the Japanese police have all excited us and left an unforgettable impression to this day. I still cannot forget a short news item that I read in the newspaper last year. At that time, it aroused some associations in me, and today, just as the Japanese people's struggle is entering a new stage of upsurge, I remember it again.
    That short news item said that on June 3, a monk from Hiroshima in Japan committed ritual suicide by disembowelment in front of Nobusuke Kishi's official residence. He left a public letter to Kishi, explaining that he committed suicide to oppose Kishi's implementation of war policies and revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty... Compared with the shock of the unified action of millions of people, this is just one aspect of the struggle. What I thought more about at the time was not whether the monk's method of struggle was ideal, because I felt that he could also take other ways to achieve his just and bright goal. What I thought more about at the time was that, as a monk, he is generally regarded as a Buddhist disciple who transcends the mundane world and does not participate in political activities. However, under the occupation of the plague god America, the Japanese people's days of suffering have become increasingly severe, the oppression of U.S. imperialism has become tighter day by day, and the self-esteem of upright Japanese people has been increasingly hurt, which has further stimulated the Japanese people's will to resist. More people have become aware, and more people have joined the torrent of struggle. Even monks who have seen through the vanity of the world are using their own lives to defend their country's pitiful national dignity. From the monk's actions, can't we see the determination of the general Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle? Just think, even a monk is like this, how can the vast numbers of Japanese workers and peasants who have suffered American oppression and humiliation not be high-spirited and rise up in resistance!
    Now we see crowds setting off on parades in the newspapers again. Also, two Buddhists in Tokyo have been holding a twenty-one-day hunger strike at the Honpō Temple in Asakusa, Taito Ward, Tokyo, since April 16 to oppose the signing of the new "Security Treaty" between the United States and Japan. On May 3, a gathering of one thousand Christians from various places in Tokyo protested the National Diet's approval of the new "Security Treaty". On May 13, the Kyoto Buddhist Conference submitted a petition to the National Diet. More than 90 people, including abbots and chief priests of famous temples, signed the petition. (See the People's Daily, May 14th and 17th). Now, the number of people in Japan participating in the opposition to the United States and its running dog Nobusuke Kishi is becoming more and more widespread. Standing at the forefront is the working class, and the vast numbers of peasants are also swarming forward, while women, ordinary citizens, university professors, industrialists, businessmen, religious believers, and monks have all come under the banner of struggle and are marching together in the streets. Even members of the Liberal Democratic Party and some other upper-level figures have expressed dissatisfaction with Nobusuke Kishi's reactionary policies. It is truly what the people want, and the running dog is being increasingly spurned; and its master is also being increasingly clearly seen by the Japanese people as the culprit of all evils, a hateful plague god!
    The strength is rapidly changing in the opposite direction, and people see this more clearly than before. When the Japanese people held their first national unified action against the signing of the new "Security Treaty" in April last year, the number of participants was hundreds of thousands; by the time of the fourth unified action in July, it had increased to one million; and when the seventh unified action was held in October, it reached four million. By the time of the fifteenth unified action that began in April this year, the number of participants had reached seven million, and it is estimated that the number of people participating in the struggle in the sixteenth unified action will exceed twenty million! Today, there may still be some people who have certain illusions about U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, but, as the general trend dictates, most of them will sooner or later become aware. From the first national unified action in Japan to now, only a little more than a year has passed, but the number of people participating in various forms of struggle has increased from hundreds of thousands to millions, and then to tens of millions! If more people had not become aware, how could the ranks have grown so rapidly!
    Chairman Mao recently said when meeting with foreign friends: In order to defeat the reactionary rule of imperialism, it is necessary to form a broad united front, to unite all forces that can be united, excluding the enemy, and to continue to carry out arduous struggles. He also said that the Japanese people are becoming more and more aware in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and more and more people are becoming aware. The Japanese people are very promising. Things are developing according to the inevitable laws of history, and Chairman Mao's words are encouraging the confidence of the people who are struggling all over the world. People are encouraging each other, supporting each other, and a broad united front is being formed. From the Pacific to the Atlantic, from the Sea of Japan to the Caribbean Sea, the flames of struggle are burning everywhere. The people's struggle against U.S. imperialism has been winning victories, which proves Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment. People's ears are filled with a huge voice: The life of imperialism will not be long, they have done all the bad things, and all the oppressed people in the world will never forgive them.
    The angry ranks are advancing victoriously and mightily, people are gathering from all directions, more and more people are participating, the strength is getting stronger and stronger, the banners are being raised higher and higher, the slogans are being shouted louder and louder, and the ranks are growing longer and longer!

    队伍越走越长
    江之水
    富士山爆发了愤怒的火焰，每天传来了日本人民英勇斗争的振奋人心的消息。在反对美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介的鲜明的旗帜下，越来越多的人走上了街头，愤怒的人们在集会、签名、请愿、示威、游行……，人们臂挽着臂，迎着无耻的军马、警棍、水龙的攻击冲向了东京，冲向了国会，冲向了岸信介政府的门前。这是日本人民一次空前规模的统一行动，抗议的呼声喊得越来越响亮了。其实，自从美国这个瘟神来到了日本之后，日本人民又何曾停止过对于瘟神的诅咒和斗争呢！
    我们曾在报纸上不断地读到日本人民争取独立自由民主斗争的消息，也看到不少表现日本人民斗争精神和力量的图片，那声势浩大的群众场面，那被人搀扶着游行示威的白发苍苍的老人，那被日本警察殴打围捕的青年学生们，都曾使我们激动过，至今留下难忘的印象。我还无法忘记去年在报纸上读过的一条短短的消息。当时它曾引起了我一些联想，而今天，正当日本人民的斗争进入一个新的高涨的阶段的时候，我又想起它来。
    在那条短短的消息上说，6月3日在日本有个广岛的和尚在岸信介官邸门前切腹自杀了。他身边留有给岸信介的一封公开信，说明他自杀是为了反对岸信介实行战争政策和修改日美安全条约……。和那千万人参加的统一行动的冲击的队伍比起来，这只不过是一个斗争的侧面，而我当时想得更多的也不是这位和尚的斗争方式是否理想，因为我觉得，他也完全可以采取另外的方式达到他那正义而光明的目的。当时我想得更多的却是作为一个和尚来说，一般都是被人看作是超尘绝俗，不参与政治活动的佛门子弟。但是，在美国这个瘟神的占领下，日本人民的苦难的日子越过越深重了，美帝国主义的压迫一天紧似一天，正直的日本人民的自尊越来越受到了伤害，这也就进一步激发了日本人民反抗的意志，有更多的人觉悟，有更多的人参加到斗争的洪流里来，甚至连看破红尘的和尚也以自身性命来保卫自己国家的可怜的民族尊严了。从这个和尚的行动里，我们不正可以看出一般日本人民反美爱国斗争的坚决吗？请想一想，一个和尚尚且如此，那千千万万遭受美国压迫和凌辱的广大的日本工人、农民怎会不意志高昂、起而反抗！
    现在我们在报纸上又看到出发游行的人群了。还有东京有两位佛教徒为反对美日签订新“安全条约”，从4月16日起在东京都台东区浅草的本法寺内举行二十一天的绝食斗争。5月3日在东京有来自各地的一千名基督教徒集会抗议国会批准新“安全条约”。5月13日，京都佛教徒会议向国会递交了请愿书。在请愿书上签名的有著名寺庙的住持、方丈等九十多人。（见5月14日、17日人民日报）现在，日本国内参加反对美国及其走狗岸信介的人是越来越广泛了，站在最前列的是工人阶级，广大农民也蜂拥前进，而妇女们、普通市民、大学教授、工商业家、教徒和僧侣们，也都走到斗争旗帜下来，一起在街头行进。甚至连自由民主党内部和其他一些上层人士也对岸信介的反动政策表示了不满。真是人心所向，走狗越来越遭到唾弃；而它的主子在日本人民心目中也越来越清楚地被人看作是一切祸害的罪魁，是个可憎的瘟神了！
    力量正在迅速地向相反的方向起变化，这一点，人们已经比以前看得更加分明。去年4月日本人民反对签订新“安全条约”举行第一次全国统一行动时，参加的人数有几十万人；到7月举行第四次统一行动时，增长到一百万人；10月举行第七次统一行动时达到四百万人。到今年4月开始的第十五次统一行动，参加的人数已经达到七百万人，而这回参加第十六次统一行动的，估计参加斗争的人数将要超过二千万人！在今天，对于美帝国主义及其走狗抱有某些幻想的人也许还是有的，但是，大势所趋，他们当中的大多数人迟早会觉悟过来的。从日本全国第一次统一行动到现在只不过经历了一年多一点的时间，然而参加各种方式斗争的人数已经由几十万而几百万，近而增加到几千万了！如果不是有更多的人觉悟起来，队伍怎么能这样迅速地壮大！
    毛主席最近在接见外国朋友们的时候曾说：为了战胜帝国主义的反动统治，必须结成广泛的统一战线，必须团结不包括敌人在内的一切可以团结的力量，继续进行艰巨的斗争。他还说，日本人民在反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争中，觉悟一天天提高，觉悟的人越来越多。日本人民是很有希望的。事情正按照历史的必然规律发展着，毛主席的话正鼓舞着全世界斗争中的人民的信心。人们正在互相鼓舞，互相支援，一个广泛的统一战线正在组成了。从太平洋到大西洋，从日本海到加勒比海，斗争的烈火到处燃烧。人民反对美帝国主义的斗争节节胜利，证实了毛主席英明的判断。人们耳边充响着一个巨大的声音：帝国主义的寿命不会很长了，他们作尽了坏事，全世界一切受压迫的人民决不会饶恕他们。
    愤怒的队伍正在浩浩荡荡地乘胜前进，人们正从四面八方集结，参加的人越来越多了，力量越来越壮大了，旗帜越举越高了，口号越喊越响亮了，队伍越走越长了！
