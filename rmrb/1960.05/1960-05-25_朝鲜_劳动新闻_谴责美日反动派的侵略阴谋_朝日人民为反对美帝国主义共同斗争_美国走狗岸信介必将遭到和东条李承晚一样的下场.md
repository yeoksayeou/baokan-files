Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 22nd. The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today, resolutely condemning the Kishi Nobusuke group for forcibly "passing" the US-Japan military alliance treaty, and warmly supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people against the US-Japan military alliance treaty.

The editorial emphasized that the Kishi Nobusuke group's vile behavior is a combination of Tojo's militarist methods and American-style gangster tactics. It is exactly the same as the Syngman Rhee group mobilizing the police to forcibly "pass" so-called "new National Security Law" and other fascist laws in the "National Assembly." Kishi Nobusuke, the faithful lackey of US imperialism, will meet the same end as Tojo and Syngman Rhee. Final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people who are fighting for justice.

The editorial said that the Kishi Nobusuke group's forcible "passage" of the US-Japan military alliance treaty is another brutal trampling on the will of the Japanese people who are striving for peace, independence, and democracy, and a vicious challenge to peace in Asia and the world. This fully exposes the essence of the Kishi Nobusuke group as a faithful lackey of US imperialism.

The editorial said that the new US-Japan military alliance treaty is the most central link in US imperialism's policy of aggression in the Far East, and it is a thoroughly aggressive treaty concocted in collusion with Japanese militarist forces. The Korean people, who have suffered tremendous sacrifices for many years due to the aggression of US imperialism and Japanese militarists, cannot sit idly by and watch this conspiracy.

The editorial continued, saying that the Korean people will never forget that the American imperialist aerial bandits who turned the Korean territory into ruins took off from Japanese bases; and many murder weapons of the US aggressor troops who took the lives of countless Korean fathers, elders, sisters, and brothers were supplied by the Japanese militarist group. Now the Kishi Nobusuke group is also colluding with the Heo Jeong group in South Korea. The Korean people cannot stand idly by and watch these guys' military collusion and saber-rattling!

The editorial pointed out that the Japanese militarists' adventurous actions of creating the US-Japan military alliance treaty, acting as pawns in US imperialism's aggressive war, and attempting to satisfy their ambition to invade Asia, can only bring disaster to the Japanese people. The editorial said that the Japanese people's struggle is our common struggle against US imperialist aggression and for safeguarding and consolidating peace in Asia. The Korean people warmly support and support the Japanese people's struggle to smash the US-Japan military alliance treaty and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”谴责美日反动派的侵略阴谋
    朝日人民为反对美帝国主义共同斗争
    美国走狗岸信介必将遭到和东条李承晚一样的下场
    新华社平壤22日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表社论，坚决谴责岸信介集团强行“通过”日美军事同盟条约，热烈支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。
    社论强调指出，岸信介集团的这种丑恶行为，是东条的军国主义手法加上美国式强盗手法的行为。是和李承晚集团动员警察在“国会”强行“通过”所谓“新国家保安法”等法西斯法令的手法是完全一样的。美帝国主义的忠实走狗岸信介的下场，将和东条、李承晚的下场一样。最后胜利必定属于为正义而斗争的日本人民。
    社论说，岸信介集团强行“通过”日美军事同盟条约，又一次粗暴地蹂躏了正在争取和平、独立和民主的日本人民的意志，恶毒地向亚洲和世界和平挑战，这完全暴露了岸信介集团是美帝国主义的忠实走狗的本质。
    社论说，新的日美军事同盟条约，是美帝国主义侵略远东政策的最中心的一环，是勾结日本军国主义势力制造的彻头彻尾的侵略性条约。许多年来由于美帝国主义和日本军国主义者的侵略而遭受了莫大牺牲的朝鲜人民，决不能坐视这种阴谋诡计。
    社论接着说，朝鲜人民永远不会忘记，把朝鲜国土炸成废墟的美帝国主义空中强盗是从日本基地起飞的；夺去了无数朝鲜父老姊妹的生命的美国侵略军的许多杀人凶器，是由日本军国主义集团供给的。现在岸信介集团又要同南朝鲜的许政集团勾结起来。朝鲜人民对这些家伙的军事勾结和擦枪磨刀的行为不能袖手旁观！
    社论指出，日本军国主义分子制造日美军事同盟条约、充当美帝国主义侵略战争的走卒、企图满足他们侵略亚洲的野心的冒险行动，只能给日本人民带来灾难。社论说，日本人民的斗争是我们反对美帝国主义侵略、维护和巩固亚洲和平的共同的斗争。朝鲜人民热烈支持和声援日本人民为粉碎日美军事同盟条约、打倒岸信介政府而进行的这一斗争。
