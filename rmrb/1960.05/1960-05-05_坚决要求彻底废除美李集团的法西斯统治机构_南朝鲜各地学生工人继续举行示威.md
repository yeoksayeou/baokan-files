    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th - Seoul Dispatch: The heroic South Korean people, in order to thoroughly abolish the fascist ruling apparatus of the US-Syngman Rhee clique, continue to wage a tenacious struggle despite the bloody suppression by US imperialism and the new puppet Heo Jeong group.
    After staging demonstrations for three consecutive days, students in Busan held another large-scale demonstration today. According to South Korean Hapdong News Agency, at 10:30 this morning, more than 1,700 middle school students in Busan demonstrated in the rain, shouting slogans such as "Immediately dissolve the current National Assembly!" and marched towards the office building of the Busan puppet "City Government."

    According to Dongyang News Agency, more than 1,500 students from Gyeongnam High Industrial School and the families of students killed in the demonstrations held a rally today and passed a resolution demanding that the criminals who killed the students be severely punished. Prior to this, they heard that Choi Yun-guk, the Rhee puppet police officer who killed students on April 19, had not only not been punished but had become the police chief of Jeju Island. This made them even more indignant.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th - Seoul Dispatch: Dockworkers in Incheon and maritime transport workers in Busan, South Korea, have launched struggles for their rights and economic demands.
