Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th dispatch: Another member of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party recently published an article in the latest issue of the "Chuo Koron" magazine, openly opposing the U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke government's conclusion of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and advocating that Japan take the road of peace and neutrality.

The article, entitled "A Frank Opinion from a Liberal Democrat," states that those who forcibly revised the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" have the same psychological tendency as the pre-war extremist nationalists and totalitarians who led Japan towards a disastrous war.

The article emphasizes that "those who cannot reflect on past mistakes and learn enough lessons from them" "will be regarded as lacking the wisdom or sense of responsibility required of politicians, and should therefore be removed from the positions they now occupy."

The Diet member then discussed the harm that the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" poses to Japan. He believes that recognizing the right of the United States to station troops in Japan is the most problematic point of the new "Security Treaty." He said that because Japan grants the United States this right, Japan can hardly avoid being drawn into the armed conflicts caused by the United States in Asia, and if Japan wants to avoid being involved in future wars, it must maintain a neutral stance.

He believes that all these problems, together with the stipulation that the treaty will last for ten years, constitute a serious threat to Japan.

When talking about economic issues, he pointed out that Japan's economy is built on an unstable foundation because Japan's current prosperity mainly relies on the war preparations promoted by the United States.

The author emphasized that "after Japan gets rid of its dependence on the U.S. war economy, it should seek a sounder way to support its economy." He finally said that this method is to establish friendly economic cooperation with Asian and African countries, including China and the Soviet Union.

This member of the Ishibashi faction within the Liberal Democratic Party also paid for his article to be printed into a booklet and distributed to all Liberal Democratic Party members of both houses of the Diet, asking them to support his views.

    日美条约严重危害日本利益
    日本应该保持和平中立立场
    日执政党一议员著文反对日美勾结
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本执政党自由民主党的又一位议员最近在最新一期的“中央公论”杂志上发表文章，公开反对美帝国主义同岸信介政府缔结日美军事同盟条约，主张日本走和平中立的道路。
    这篇题为“一个自由民主党员的坦率意见”的文章说：那些强行修改日美“安全条约”的人们具有把日本引向灾难性的战争的战前极端民族主义的极权主义者同样的心理倾向。
    文章强调说，“那些不能反省过去的错误从中吸取足够的教训的人”，“将被看作缺乏对政治家所要求的那种智慧或责任感，因而应该把他们从现在所占据的职位上推下来”。
    这位议员接着谈到了新日美“安全条约”对日本的危害。他认为，承认美国在日本驻扎军队的权利，是新“安全条约”中最成问题的一点。他说，由于给予美国这种权利，日本几乎无法使自己不卷入美国在亚洲引起的武装冲突，如果日本想避免卷入将来可能发生的战争，它就必须保持中立的立场。
    他认为，这一切问题，连同规定条约期限为十年这一点，形成了对日本的严重威胁。
    他在谈到经济问题时指出，日本的经济是建立在不稳定的基础上的，因为日本当前的繁荣主要是依靠美国推行的战争准备。
    作者强调说，“日本在摆脱对美国战争经济的依赖以后，应当寻求用以支持其经济的更健全的办法。”他最后说，这种办法就是同亚非国家，其中包括中国和苏联建立友好的经济合作。
    这位自由民主党内的石桥派成员还自己出钱将其文章刊印成小册子分发给国会两院的所有自由民主党议员，要求他们支持他的看法。
