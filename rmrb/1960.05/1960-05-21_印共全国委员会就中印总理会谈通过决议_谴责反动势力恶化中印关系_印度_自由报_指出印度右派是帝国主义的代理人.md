Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 19th: The National Committee of the Communist Party of India passed a resolution on May 12 regarding the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and India. The resolution expressed regret that the meeting did not find a solution to the Sino-Indian border dispute.

The National Committee warned that "certain powerful forces are keen on maintaining the dispute between India and China and creating discord and tension between the two countries. Since this issue became the most important one, these forces have spared no effort to worsen relations and prevent every action taken in peaceful negotiations. They have taken advantage of tragic developments, not only to pull India and China apart, but even to attack India's policies of peace and non-alignment. In fact, their offensive against Sino-Indian friendship is an integral part of their broader destructive strategy against Afro-Asian solidarity and world peace. It must also be pointed out that reactionary disruptive forces are attempting to use the Sino-Indian issue to divide the national movement and promote the cause of reactionaries in our national life."

The National Committee also pointed out that foreign imperialists and domestic reactionaries will make even more dying struggles, doing everything possible to undermine the atmosphere and frustrate the talks.

The resolution stated, "The National Committee regrets to point out that some remarks by officials are sometimes inconsistent with India's policy of peaceful negotiations and have been used by reactionary forces to promote their aims.

"In this situation, the people of our country have a great responsibility to defend the policy of holding peace talks on the Sino-Indian border dispute and to defend the greater cause of India's policy of peace and non-alignment. The National Committee of the Communist Party of India calls on all those who support these policies to contribute to further improving the atmosphere so that efforts to peacefully resolve the Sino-Indian border issue can make progress and succeed."

The resolution stated, "Regardless of the current difficulties, the National Committee is deeply convinced that as long as an attitude of goodwill and friendly discussion is adopted, the Sino-Indian border issue will certainly be resolved peacefully."

Cooperation and friendship between India and China not only brought Panchsheel and the Bandung Spirit to the world, but also indeed had a profound impact on the historical process of the entire Asian and African region, and strengthened the greater cause of world peace.

"Therefore, it is understandable that all Asian and African countries, and indeed all peace-loving people around the world, so sincerely hope that the problems between these two major countries with a combined population of one billion will be resolved for the benefit of all mankind."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 19th: The Indian "Freedom Daily" published an editorial on May 16 on the incident of US planes invading the Soviet Union for espionage activities, pointing out the danger of Indian rightists using the anti-China hysteria they created in an attempt to drag India into military alliances.

The editorial emphasized that the US plane took off from Peshawar Airport in Pakistan, showing the serious danger of the US-Pakistan military treaty and the "Indo-Pakistan joint defense" plan advocated by Indian rightists. The editorial said, "Truth, like lightning, exposes all lies through one incident."

The editorial pointed out that those who use the Sino-Indian dispute, cover up the facts, and thus attempt to bind India in a common defense organization with Pakistan should be regarded as direct agents of imperialism.

The editorial said, "Fortunately, in the very relentless development of history, the role they play has been exposed to the public eye." The editorial said that these traitors must be exposed in order to ensure that India pursues a peaceful and independent foreign policy.

The editorial also condemned some people in India with ulterior motives for defaming China by using the incident of the US plane invading the Sino-Indian border. The editorial said, "Whenever any unidentified aircraft is found on the Indian border, there are always people in the People's House representing the Indian People's Socialist Party, the Indian People's Alliance, and the Liberal Party who say that these aircraft are Chinese."

The editorial said that even the Indian government raised direct questions about this with the Chinese government during the meeting between the two Prime Ministers. "Zhou Enlai's reply was that if such aircraft were seen over India, they should be shot down, and they would not object to doing so. Zhou Enlai's reply naturally dispelled this slander. The appearance of a US spy plane in Soviet airspace made China's reply particularly clear." The editorial said that many people now believe that these aircraft probably came from US bases in Pakistan, Thailand, Laos, or Taiwan, and their purpose was to carry out espionage activities over the Sino-Indian border.

    印共全国委员会就中印总理会谈通过决议
    谴责反动势力恶化中印关系
    印度“自由报”指出印度右派是帝国主义的代理人
    新华社新德里19日电　印度共产党全国委员会5月12日就中印两国总理会谈通过一项决议。决议对这次会谈没有找到解决中印边界纠纷的办法表示遗憾。
    全国委员会警告说，“有些强有力的势力热中于保持印度和中国之间的纠纷以及在两国之间制造不和和紧张。自从这个问题成为最重要的问题之后，这些势力就不遗余力地使关系恶化，并且阻止在和平谈判方面采取的每一个行动。他们利用了悲剧性事态发展，不仅仅是为了把印度和中国拉开，而且甚至攻击印度的和平和不结盟的政策。事实上，他们对印中友谊的进攻就是他们反对亚非团结和世界和平的更广泛的破坏性战略的不可分割的一部分。还必须指出，反动的破坏性势力正在企图利用印中问题来分裂民族运动和在我国生活中促进反动派的事业。”
    全国委员会还指出，国外帝国主义者和国内反动派将更加作出垂死的挣扎，千方百计地破坏气氛和使会谈遭到挫折。
    决议说，“全国委员会遗憾地指出，官方人士的某些言论有时是同印度的和平谈判的政策不相吻合的，而且被反动势力利用来促进他们的目的。
    “在这种情况下，我国人民就负有巨大的责任来保卫在印中边界纠纷问题上举行和谈的政策和保卫印度的和平和不结盟政策这个更大的事业。印度共产党全国委员会呼吁一切拥护这些政策的人们作出贡献，更进一步地改善气氛以便和平解决印中边界问题的努力能够取得进展，并且取得成功。”
    决议说，“不管目前的困难怎样，全国委员会深信，只要采取善意和友好讨论的态度，印中边界问题是一定会得到和平解决的。”
    印度和中国之间的合作和友谊不仅给世界带来潘查希拉和万隆精神，而且的确还对整个亚非地区的历史的进程起了深刻的影响，并且加强了更大的世界和平事业。
    “因此，如果所有的亚非国家而且的确还有全世界各地的所有爱和平人民，都这么真诚地希望这两个人口共有十亿的大国之间的问题得到解决而有利于全人类，那么这是可以理解的。”
    新华社新德里19日电　印度“自由报”5月16日就美国飞机侵犯苏联进行间谍活动事件发表社论，指出印度右派利用他们制造的反华歇斯底里，把印度拖入军事联盟的企图的危险。
    社论着重指出，这架美国飞机是从巴基斯坦白沙瓦机场起飞的，可见美巴军事条约和印度右派鼓吹的“印巴联防”计划的严重危险。社论说，“真理像闪电一样，通过一个事件就揭穿了一切谎言。”
    社论指出，那些利用中印争端、掩盖事实，从而企图把印度束缚在同巴基斯坦的共同防御组织中的人应当被认为是帝国主义的直接代理人。
    社论说，“令人高兴的是，在历史的非常无情的发展中，他们所扮演的角色已在公众眼前暴露了。”社论说，必须揭露这些卖国贼，才能保证印度执行和平、独立的外交政策。
    社论还谴责印度一些别有用心的人借美机侵犯中印边界事件对中国进行诽谤。社论说，“每当印度边境上发现任何来历不明的飞机时，总是有人在人民院代表印度人民社会党、印度人民同盟和自由党这些党派，说什么这些飞机是中国的。”
    社论说，甚至印度政府也在两国总理会谈时向中国政府提出了直接有关这方面的问题。“周恩来的答复是，如果看到印度上空有这种飞机，那就把它们打下来，他们不反对这样做。周恩来的这种答复，自然消除了这种诽谤。而美国间谍飞机出现在苏联高空，使得中国的这一答复格外清楚了。”社论说，现在有许多人认为，这些飞机大概是从巴基斯坦、泰国、老挝或台湾的美国基地来的，它们的目的是在中印边境上空进行间谍活动。
