Fragrance Travels Thousands of Miles, Price Inestimable
By Our Reporter Lu Liang

West Lake, besides its tranquil waters, is most intoxicating for its fragrant and captivating flowers and plants. Here, there are bright yellow banksia roses, red roses, refreshing lilacs, and pure white magnolias... But few people know that these exotic flowers and herbs, in addition to being enjoyed by people, are also important raw materials for the fragrance industry.

The beautiful West Lake is one of the raw material bases for China's fragrance industry. The climate here is mild, with abundant rainfall, suitable for planting various flowers. In accordance with the Party's policy of combining greening with production, the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee proposed to the garden departments as early as 1958 that West Lake and the entire Hangzhou should be greened, beautified, fruit-bearing, and fragrant. Many gardens for people to enjoy and rest have been opened around West Lake, planted with various fragrant flowers and herbs. The sides of the streets in Hangzhou city are already shaded by green trees, like green jade belts. In the green corridor, red flowers dot the landscape, which are small residential gardens and bonsai. The original barren hillsides and valleys have also been planted with osmanthus, citrus, and winter daphne; shade-tolerant daphne, hosta, monthly roses, roses, and other flowers and trees have been planted in the gaps between forests and along transportation routes. In addition to actively finding ways to self-reliantly solve the problem of tree seedlings and flower seeds for transplanting, the Municipal Garden Department has also introduced and collected a large number of excellent varieties of fragrance plants, such as fragrant geranium, rose, banksia rose, and broad-leaved magnolia, from Shanghai, Guangdong, Sichuan, Chongqing, and other places, totaling nearly two hundred species. The city has established more than 6,000 mu of natural fragrance raw material bases.

In the past, when flowers and plants withered, they were always swept away as garbage, but now they have become the wealth of the country. The West Lake Fragrance Factory extracts various aromatic oils from fresh flowers, wild grasses, leaves, seeds, stems, roots, fruit peels, bark, and tree trunks. Various natural essential oils are extracted from leaves and grasses such as geranium and spearmint; various concretes are extracted from fragrant flowers such as osmanthus and tuberose. The high-grade and precious rose oil extracted from roses is worth about 10,000 yuan per kilogram.

    香飘万里价无穷
    本报记者　卢良
    西湖，除了那平静的湖水，使人迷醉的要算那馥香扑鼻的奇花异草了。这里有娇黄的木香，红色的蔷薇，清新的丁香花，洁白的玉兰……但人们很少知道，这些奇花异草，除了供人们欣赏之外，它还是香料工业的重要原料。
    美丽的西子湖畔，它是我国香料工业的原料基地之一。这里气候温和，雨水充沛，适宜栽种各种花卉。中共杭州市委根据党的绿化和生产相结合的方针，早在1958年就向园林部门提出了要绿化、美化、果化和香化西湖和整个杭州。西湖周围已开辟了许多供人赏玩和休息的花园，栽着各种香花异草。杭州市区街道的两旁已是绿树成荫，像是绿色的玉带。在绿色的长廊中，红花点点，这是小小的居民花园和盆景。原来的荒山坡、山谷地带也种上了桂花、柑桔、黄瑞香；林间隙地、交通道沿线也都栽植了耐阴的结香、玉簪、月季、玫瑰等花木。市园林部门除积极设法自力更生解决树苗和花种移栽种植外，还从上海、广东、四川、重庆等地引进和收集了大量的香叶天竹葵、玫瑰、木香、广玉兰等近二百种香料植物优良品种。全市已建立了六千多亩的天然香料原料基地。
    过去，花草雕落后，一直是被人们当垃圾扫去，现在它已经成为国家的财富。西湖香料厂，从鲜花、野草、叶籽、茎根、果皮、树皮、树干中提取各种芳香油。利用天竹葵、留兰香等叶、草提炼各种天然香精油；利用桂花、晚香玉等香花提炼各种浸膏。用玫瑰花提炼出的高级名贵的玫瑰油，每公斤价值一万元左右。
