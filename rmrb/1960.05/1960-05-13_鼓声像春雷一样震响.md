    The Sound of Drums Resonates Like Spring Thunder
    Liu Baiyu
    A friend from Cameroon brought a music film. I haven't had much contact with the art of Black Africa, but this music film tells me how beautiful the music is there. It's truly beautiful! A group of people drifting downstream, paddling and singing along with the music. The gentle singing and graceful melody make you feel how lovely the clear river, dense forest, air, and sunshine are. However, what impressed me most in the music was the drumbeat, the elegant drumbeat, the joyful drumbeat. I think that people with such artistic qualities will eventually stand up one day, and that drumbeat will inevitably spread from Black Africa to the whole world.
    However, soon after, I had the opportunity to preview a proof of a novel from Senegal, from which I saw a description of the sound of drums:
    People come in small groups to the small palm grove. The sound of drums is thumping. Its tone is becoming more and more rapid, making people feel chills. It passes through the grassland and across the river, turning into strings of sound waves, and the echo repeats the sorrowful news in all directions.
    This is the drumbeat of disaster, the drumbeat of alarm. Umar, the protagonist of the book, was secretly murdered by European whites. You can imagine how much bloodshed and death the people there, under the colonialists' massacres and plunder, will experience from such rapid drumbeats like raindrops! However, people know that there, the blood and lives of black people are not worth a penny. The book "Motherland, Beloved People" conveys to me a drumbeat that makes people uneasy. But I know that this is precisely the reality of Black Africa. A vast continent, so rich and so beautiful, has been turned into a purgatory and slaughterhouse by colonialists. If you think about it carefully: In London, Paris, and New York, many luxurious skyscrapers are stained with the blood of this alien people on every brick. Do the people who enjoy themselves inside hear the drumbeats full of resentment coming from every brick?
    Today, the drumbeats full of resentment have finally broken through the jungle and the cage, and resounded to the sky.
    One night, I heard the Algerian war song "Long Live Algeria" on the radio. As soon as I heard it, it was so fresh and so vigorous. Any people who are fighting and advancing must have vibrant art. Listen:
    "Not afraid of the crazy enemy,
    Not afraid of cannons,
    Not afraid of airplanes,
    Not afraid of the crazy enemy,
    For the sacred motherland,
    Let us bravely advance!"
    What heroism! What heroes! Here, the drumbeat sounds along with the footsteps of the marching soldiers. It is loud, it calls, it is extremely exciting, and it makes people yearn for the unparalleled heroism of the fighting people. This is the drumbeat of fighting against colonial rule, this is the drumbeat of striving for freedom and liberation.
    From that night on, I often stay tuned to the radio, seeking in human life the kind of music and art that is the most beautiful, the most uplifting, the most high-spirited, and the most inspiring. And I believe that art will most fully reveal the voice of our great era. My search has not failed. I heard the heroic Cuban march, I heard the anti-war songs of Japan, and, in this series of struggle music, I heard the drumbeat as a signal of progress. This drumbeat has such an attraction that you feel how good it would be if you and those brothers were together, holding hands, shoulder to shoulder, advancing. What does it matter if there are water hoses, whips, bullets, and bayonets in front of you! What a magnificent and soul-stirring life this is. However, I think this is not accidental, these drumbeats foreshadow the arrival of a new storm of struggle.
    The truth of Marxism is absolutely true: old things appear powerful on the surface, but are weak in essence; new things appear young on the surface, but are full of strong vitality, and one day, this new life will surely break through all restrictions and rise suddenly. Not long ago, could you imagine that Cuba, in the "backyard" of the United States, as Guillen said, "looks very sweet on the surface, but is actually bitter inside," could suddenly become the front line of the anti-American struggle? The sugar cane cutting knives are waving, and there is a spirit of fighting everywhere. Not long ago, could you imagine that South Korea, located on the outpost of the United States' offensive against socialist countries, everywhere with barbed wire and bayonet tips, could suddenly erupt into a prairie fire. Empty-handed people burned down the Liberal Party headquarters of Syngman Rhee, seized guns and tanks, built barricades, and fought bloody battles. In an instant, Syngman Rhee, a loyal American lackey, was swept away like garbage? In Turkey, demonstrators surrounded Menderes in public on the street, making the dictator pale, his hair disheveled, and his shirt dragged out of his pants. In Japan, tens of millions of people swept across the country like a torrent of anger, rushing straight to Tokyo. They broke through layers of police lines and poured into the Diet hall. Gunshots rang out on the land of Algeria, and Africans in the Northern Rhodesian copper mining area heroically resisted the colonialists who attacked with flares and tear gas. Yes, all this shows that the people cannot be suppressed, the people are the most powerful, the people are the decisive factor in history; and all puppet idols, all "sacred" halls, in the face of these heroic people who command the wind and clouds, have to fall down one after another.
    Now, all over the world, from east to west, from south to north, struggles are rising everywhere, like countless blazing flames, decorating the earth so youthful, so beautiful. The people's struggle will never stop, and the people's struggle will not stop until imperialism is completely collapsed. The sound of advancing footsteps is the sound of drums, and the sound of drums is the sound of thunder before the storm.
    We say this not out of subjective desire, but out of such an objective truth: as long as there is oppression, there will be struggle, as long as there is the cruel exploitation of monopoly capital, there will be a struggle against exploitation; as long as there is imperialist aggression, there will be a struggle against aggression; as long as there is colonialism, there will be a struggle against colonialism, struggle, this is an eternal and unbreakable truth. And all these struggles will surely unite into a vast front and organize into a unified action under the brilliant light of Marxism. Marx said: Revolution is the locomotive of history. And history is leaping forward in this turbulent struggle. Let us think about the song "Arise, ye prisoners of starvation" that arose along with the gunshots resounding through the streets of Paris! Think about the gunshots fired by the Aurora from the Neva River in the October dawn, towards the entire old world! Think about the singing that shook China in the smoke of battle, "Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves"! At first, they were all opening up a crack in the old world, and along with them, more and more awakened people gathered, fighting more and more bravely, and finally changed the old world and created a new world. Today, this surging reality shows that a new revolutionary situation has formed, and a new revolutionary action has begun. Comrade Mao Zedong said thirty years ago when he talked about the high tide of the Chinese revolution: "It is a ship standing on the coast, watching the sea, and the tip of the mast has already been seen, it is standing on the top of the mountain and looking far to the east, and it has seen the sun radiating its light and about to burst out, it is a baby about to mature in the mother's womb." This revolutionary struggle has achieved victory in China. And now, Comrade Mao Zedong tells us that the struggles of the South Korean and Turkish people show that the storm of the struggle of the oppressed people of Asian countries against imperialism and its lackeys will have greater rise.
    Finally, let me turn back to talking about music! Do you know how powerful music is? Don't you think that every great era of change begins in a kind of uplifting music? This is the sound of footsteps, the sound of drums, the sound of thunder. In the era when the people of the world are rising up and marching towards imperialism, how much we need this drumbeat that resonates like spring thunder! This is a weapon, this is confidence, this is singing. The sound of drums will not stop, the sound of drums is getting louder and louder, from the jungles of Africa, from the rapids of America, from the wilderness of Asia, from the streets of Europe, drumming up. All directions, shaking the world, until finally, the evil demon of imperialism is completely wiped out. The sound of drums is the sound of gathering people, the sound of drums is the sound of setting out, the sound of drums is the sound of charging into battle. But we also know that thunder brings storms and also brings spring; drums bring battles and also bring victory. Today, this drumbeat! Like spring thunder, it is announcing the passing of snow and ice, and it is announcing the arrival of spring.

    鼓声像春雷一样震响
    刘白羽
    一位喀麦隆朋友，带来一张音乐片。我对于黑非洲的艺术，接触得不多，但，这张音乐片，却告诉我，那儿有着多么优美的音乐。真是美极了！一群顺流而下的人们，伴随音乐划着桨、歌唱着。那委婉的歌声，那娴雅的旋律，使你感到那清澈的河流，茂密的森林，那空气、那阳光，有多么可爱。但是，在我脑海中印象最深的，是那音乐中的鼓点，那是优雅的鼓点，欢乐的鼓点。我想，有着这样艺术素质的人民，终于有一天会站起来，而那鼓声，也必然会从黑非洲传遍全世界。
    可是，不久，我得到先看一部塞内加尔小说校样的机会，从中，我看到了关于鼓声的描写：
    人们一小群一小群地向小棕榈林走来。鼓声咚咚地响着。它的音调，越来越急促，令人不寒而栗。它通过草原，越过河流变成一串串的声波，回声在四面八方重复着令人悲痛的消息。
    这是灾难的、报警的鼓声。书中的主角乌马尔被欧洲白人暗害死了。你可以想像得到，那儿的人民，在殖民主义者的屠杀、掠夺之下，这样雨点一样急促的鼓声，将给人们带来多少流血和死亡的悲恸啊！可是，人们知道，在那儿，黑人的血与生命原是不值一文钱的。“祖国，可爱的人民”这部书，传达给我的鼓声，是令人惶惶不安的鼓声。但，我知道这正是黑非洲的现实。一个莽莽大陆，那样富饶，那样美丽，却给殖民主义者变成炼狱，变成屠场。你仔细想一想：在伦敦，在巴黎，在纽约，许多豪华的摩天大厦，原来每块砖石，就都染着这异族人民的鲜血。在这里面享乐的人，可曾听到从每块砖石上发出那充满怨恨的鼓声。
    今天，充满怨恨的鼓声，终于冲破那丛林，那樊笼，而冲天震响起来了。
    一个夜晚，我从收音机上听到阿尔及利亚的战歌“万岁！阿尔及利亚”，我一听，那样清新，那样刚健。凡是正在战斗、前进的人民，他们的艺术必定生气勃勃。你听：
    “不怕疯狂的敌人，
    不怕大炮，
    不怕飞机，
    不怕疯狂的敌人，
    为了神圣的祖国，
    让我们奋勇前进！”
    何等的豪迈！何等的英雄！在这儿，鼓声合着进军者的脚步咚咚鸣响着。它嘹亮、它号召、它万分激动人心，它使人神往于那战斗人民无比的英雄气概。这是对殖民统治战斗的鼓声，这是争取自由解放的鼓声。
    从那一晚以后，我常常守着收音机，我寻求在人类生活中，属于那种最美好、最向上、最意气昂然，最振奋人心的音乐艺术。而我相信，艺术将最充分地透露我们这个大时代的心声。我的寻求没有落空。我听到了豪迈的古巴的进行曲，我听到了日本反战的歌声，而且，在这一系列斗争的乐曲中，我都听到了那作为前进信号的鼓声。这鼓声，有那么一种吸引力，使你觉得这时如果你和那些兄弟一起，拉着手，并着肩，前进，该有多么好。前面有水龙，有皮鞭，有子弹，有刺刀，那算什么！这是多么撼人肺腑的壮丽生活啊。不过，我想这不是偶然的，这些鼓声，预示着一场新的斗争风暴的到来。
    马克思主义这条真理是千真万确的：旧事物表面看起来强大，实质上是虚弱的；新事物表面上看起来幼小，但是富有强壮的生命力，而且有一天，这新生命，一定会冲破一切限制，而崛然兴起。不久之前，你能设想：在美国“后院”，像纪廉所说“表面上看起来很甜，里面其实苦不堪言”的古巴，怎么一朝之间，竟变成了反美斗争的前线了呢？一个古巴，将带来一个拉丁美洲的春天。那些割甘蔗的长刀挥舞起来了，那儿洋溢着一派战斗精神。不久之前，你能设想：在南朝鲜，处在美国进攻社会主义国家的前哨阵地上，到处是铁丝网，到处是刺刀尖的南朝鲜，怎么一朝之间竟爆发了燎原大火。赤手空拳的人们，烧了李承晚的自由党总部，夺取了枪枝和坦克，筑起街垒，浴血作战。顷刻之间，把一个美国忠实走狗李承晚，竟像垃圾一样一扫而光了呢？在土耳其，示威者在大街上，当众包围了曼德列斯，使得这个独裁者面色苍白，头发凌乱，衬衫也从裤子里拖了出来。在日本，千千万万人民简直像怒潮一样席卷全国，直冲东京。他们冲破一层层警察封锁线，一涌进入国会会堂。阿尔及利亚的土地上响着枪声，北罗得西亚铜矿地带的非洲人，英勇地抗击用照明弹和催泪弹进攻的殖民主义者。是的，这一切说明：人民是压不倒的，人民是最有力量的，人民是决定历史的因素；而一切傀儡偶像，一切“神圣”殿堂，在这些叱咤风云的英雄人们面前，都不得不纷纷倒下。
    现在，全世界各地，从东到西，从南到北，到处都兴起斗争，就像无数熊熊火焰，把个地球装饰得如此青春，如此美丽。人民的斗争是永远不会停止的，帝国主义不彻底崩溃，人民的斗争是不会停止的。前进的脚步声就是鼓声，鼓声就是暴风雨前的雷声。
    我们这样说，不是出于主观愿望，而是出于这样一种客观真理：只要有压迫就会有斗争，有垄断资本的残酷剥削，就会有反剥削的斗争；有帝国主义的侵略，就会有反侵略的斗争；有殖民主义，就会有反殖民主义的斗争，斗争，这是永远颠扑不破的真理。而这一切斗争，必将在马克思主义光辉照耀之下，团结成为一个辽阔的战线，组织成为一个统一的行动。马克思说过：革命是历史的火车头。而历史正是在这汹涌澎湃的斗争中飞跃前进的。让我们想一想：那随同响彻巴黎街头的枪声，而兴起的“起来，饥寒交迫的奴隶”的歌声吧！想一想：“阿芙乐尔”号，在10月黎明中，从?瓦河上，对整个旧世界发出的炮声吧！想一想：震撼在中国战斗硝烟中，那“起来，不愿作奴隶的人们”的歌唱吧！它们最初，都是打开旧世界一个裂罅，而随同它们，觉醒的人愈聚愈多，愈战愈勇，终于改变了旧世界，创造了新世界。今天，这风起云涌的现实，说明一个新的革命形势已经形成，一个新的革命行动已经开始。毛泽东同志在三十年前谈到中国革命高潮时说过：“它是站在海岸遥望海中已经看得见桅杆尖头了的一只航船，它是立于高山之巅远看东方已见光芒四射喷薄欲出的一轮朝日，它是躁动于母腹中的快要成熟了的一个婴儿。”这一革命斗争，在中国取得了胜利。而现在，毛泽东同志告诉我们：南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民的这种斗争，表明亚洲各国受压迫人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴，将会有更大的兴起。
    最后，还是让我回头来谈到音乐吧！您们知道音乐有多么大的力量吗？您们不觉得，每个大时代的变迁，都是在一种昂扬的乐声中开始的吗？这就是脚步声，鼓声，雷声。当全世界人民向帝国主义奋起进军的年代，我们多么需要这像春雷一样震响的鼓声呀！这是武器，这是信心，这是歌唱。鼓声不会停息，鼓声正在愈敲愈响，从非洲的丛林中，从美洲的急流上，从亚洲的原野间，从欧洲的街道上，敲起。四面八方，震响世界，一直到最后，把帝国主义，这个恶魔全部消灭干净。鼓声是聚集人的声音，鼓声是出发前进的声音，鼓声是冲锋陷阵的声音。但是，我们也知道：雷声带来风暴，也带来春天；鼓声带来战斗，也带来胜利。今天，这鼓声呀！已经像春雷一样，它正在宣布风雪的消逝，它正在宣布春天的到来。
