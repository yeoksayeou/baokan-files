    Improve Management, Plan Grain Use, Develop Household Production
    Jiangxi and Sichuan Run Canteens Well to Support Spring Ploughing
    Xixia County Implements "Four Specials" Grain Management, Canteens Have Sufficient Food and Grain

    (Our report) Nanchang dispatch – While vigorously grasping production, rural areas in Jiangxi have further strengthened leadership over canteen work, making the province's more than 140,000 rural public canteens a strong rear service department to support spring ploughing production.
    During the busy and intense spring ploughing production, in order to ensure that the broad masses of commune members eat well and are healthy, and to ensure high attendance rates, Party committees at all levels are leading canteens to actively carry out household production and train cooks. They have launched a "comparing food diversity, comparing nutritional conditioning, comparing tea and water convenience, comparing cleanliness and hygiene, comparing service attitude" competition among canteens and cooks to support spring ploughing. In terms of building up canteen assets, various localities have implemented the principle of self-reliance and running canteens diligently and thriftily, launching a household production campaign of "growing more vegetables, raising more livestock and poultry, and raising more aquatic products." Most canteens have established vegetable bases, livestock and poultry farms, fish ponds, and sideline food processing plants. According to statistics from more than 124,300 canteens across the province, more than one million mu of vegetables have been planted, and more than two million pigs have been raised, averaging one mu of vegetable land for every ten people and one pig for every five people. The establishment of household assets by canteens has made material preparations for the busy spring ploughing season. Many canteens have not only arranged sufficient grain and vegetables but have also prepared a certain amount of meat, fish, and eggs. The more than 3,000 canteens in Gaoan County prepared six taels of oil, four taels of wine, half a catty of meat, half a catty of fish, four taels of bean products, and four to six eggs for each person during the rice transplanting period, with three catties of vegetables every day, and arranged for three meals of dry rice or two dry and one thin meals of grain every day.
    In terms of cleanliness and hygiene, canteens in various places have recently formulated hygiene covenants and established a cleaning system of one small cleaning a day and one large cleaning every three days. Generally, they have achieved clean food, clean cooking utensils, clean tableware and utensils, and clean front and back of the house. Most canteens have set up sanitary facilities such as fly-proof gauze covers, spittoons, and wash basins. Cooks wear aprons and masks when cooking, and tableware is disinfected.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu dispatch – Sichuan Province is strengthening the work of public canteens to support spring ploughing production.
    In order to ensure that the broad masses of commune members eat well during the busy spring season, various localities have further strengthened leadership over vegetable cultivation and other sideline production while planning grain use. According to statistics from 16 special districts (cities) including Neijiang and Wanxian, the vegetable planting area of canteens has reached 4.8 million mu, ensuring a continuous supply of fresh vegetables to the canteens. Rural canteens in various places are vigorously carrying out cooking utensil reforms to reduce the labor intensity of cooks and improve the quality of food. The Wanxian Special District organized more than 2,000 working groups to go deep into the canteens to help with work.

    (Our report) Zhengzhou dispatch – Henan Province, Xixia County, based on the new characteristics of grain consumption shifting from individual households to collective consumption after the people's commune, all 13 people's communes in the county have established a complete set of grain management systems, adopting the methods of special warehouse storage, special account recording, special personnel in charge, and special grain for special use, which not only promoted the development of production but also ensured that the county's 3,147 rural public canteens were well-run with sufficient food and grain.
    The "Four Specials" method of rural grain management in Xixia County began to be implemented after last year's autumn harvest. Previously, the county did not have a sound system for grain management, grain was piled up, cadres and the masses were unaware of the amounts, and income and expenditure were chaotic. In order to eliminate loopholes in grain management work, the Xixia County Party Committee, while comprehensively arranging the lives of commune members and strengthening education on saving grain and planned grain use, proposed the "Four Specials" method of grain management: separating the grain warehouse from other agricultural products and equipment for storage; at the same time, implementing separate storage of seeds, rations, feed grain, and reserve grain; and designating full-time personnel to be responsible for management, and no misappropriation is allowed. The 13 people's communes in the county have established a total of 3,083 warehouses and 9,249 rooms, including 485 seed warehouses, 518 feed warehouses, 1,846 food ration warehouses, and 234 reserve warehouses. A sound system has also been established in terms of accounts and management procedures. All rations for the rural population in the county are implemented with fixed quotas per person, food to the canteen, targets to the household, and savings returned to the individual. Furthermore, in accordance with the spirit of eating more during busy periods, eating less during slack periods, and planned and economical use of grain, a monthly grain use method of four increases (June, July, October, November), four averages (August, September, March, May), and four decreases (January, February, April, December) is implemented. Feed indicators are allocated to the pastures, and livestock are allocated grain rations according to the number of heads and busy/slack periods; seeds are packaged to production teams according to the planting plan; and reserve grain is uniformly managed directly by the brigade. In order to strengthen the leadership of grain management work, grain management organizations have been established from the county to various brigades and canteens, and a total of 493 cadres have been equipped to manage commune grain work full-time.
    After the implementation of the "Four Specials" method for grain storage and the establishment of a management system for special grain for special use, the grain situation in Xixia County was unprecedentedly stable, commune members were all beaming with joy, and seeds, feed, and reserves were very abundant. The canteens were running better and better.

    改进管理　计划用粮　发展家底生产
    江西四川办好食堂支援春耕
    西峡县实行粮食“四专”管理食堂菜足粮丰
    本报讯　江西各地农村在狠抓生产的同时，进一步加强了对食堂工作的领导，使全省十四万多个农村公共食堂成为支援春耕生产的坚强的后勤部。
    在繁忙紧张的春耕生产中，为保证广大社员吃饱吃好，人人身体健康，出勤率高，各级党委领导食堂积极进行家底生产，训练炊事人员，开展了食堂之间、炊事管理人员之间的“比饭菜多样、比营养调剂、比茶水方便、比清洁卫生、比服务态度”的支援春耕竞赛运动。在建设食堂家底方面，各地贯彻自力更生，勤俭办食堂的原则，开展了“蔬菜种得多、家畜家禽养得多、水产养得多”的家底生产运动，大部分食堂都建立了蔬菜基地、家畜家禽饲养场、渔塘和副食品加工厂。据全省十二万四千三百多个食堂的统计，已种蔬菜一百多万亩，养猪二百多万头，平均每十人有一亩菜地，每五人有一头猪。食堂建立了家底，为春耕生产大忙做好了物质准备，很多食堂不仅安排了足够的粮食和蔬菜，还准备了一定数量的肉、鱼和蛋。高安县三千多个食堂，为每个人在插秧期间准备了六两油、四两酒、半斤肉、半斤鱼、四两豆制品、四到六个蛋，每天三斤蔬菜，安排了每天三餐干饭或二干一稀的粮食。
    在清洁卫生方面，最近各地食堂普遍制订了卫生公约，建立了一天一小扫，三天一大扫的清扫制度，一般都做到了食物净、炊具净、碗筷用具净、屋前屋后净。大部分食堂都设置了防蝇纱罩、痰盂、洗手盆等卫生设备。炊事员做饭穿围裙、戴口罩，碗筷都经消毒。
    据新华社成都电　四川省各地加强公共食堂工作，支援春耕生产。
    为了保证广大社员在春排大忙中吃饱吃好，各地在计划用粮的同时，都进一步加强了种菜等副业生产的领导。据内江、万县等十六个专区（市）统计，食堂种菜面积已达四百八十万亩，保证食堂不断有新鲜蔬菜供应。各地农村食堂都在大力进行炊具改革，使炊事员减轻劳动强度，提高饭菜质量。万县专区组织了二千多个工作组，深入到食堂帮助工作。
    本报讯　河南省西峡县根据人民公社化以后，粮食由一家一户消费到集体食用的新特点，全县十三个人民公社都建立了一套完整的粮食管理制度，采取专仓保管、专账记载、专人负责、专粮专用的办法，不仅促进了生产的发展，而且保证了全县三千一百四十七个农村公共食堂，菜足粮丰，越办越好。
    西峡县农村粮食管理的“四专”办法是从去年秋收以后开始实行的。以前，全县在粮食管理工作方面都没有一个健全的制度，粮食拢大堆，干部、群众都心中无数，收支混乱。为了杜绝粮食管理工作的漏洞，中共西峡县委在全面安排社员生活，加强节约用粮、计划用粮教育的同时，提出了粮食管理“四专”办法，把粮食仓与其它农产品和器材分开保管，同时，实行种籽、口粮、饲料粮和储备粮分仓保管，并确定专职人员负责管理，不得挪用。全县十三个人民公社，共建立仓库三千零八十三座，九千二百四十九间仓房，其中种籽库四百八十五座，饲料库五百一十八座，人食口粮库一千八百四十六座，储备库二百三十四座。在账目和管理手续方面也都建立了一套健全的制度。全县农村人口的口粮，全部实行以人定量，食物到堂，指标到户和节约归己的制度。并且根据忙时多吃、闲时少吃、计划和节约用粮精神，实行四增（6、7、10、11月）、四平（8、9、3、5月）、四减（1、2、4、12月）的分月用粮办法。饲料指标分配到牧场，牲畜分头、分忙闲定量领粮；种籽随播种计划包到生产队；储备粮一律归大队直接管理。为了加强粮食管理工作的领导，从县到各个大队、食堂，都建立了粮食管理机构，全县共配备专管公社粮食工作的干部有四百九十三人。
    粮食保管实行“四专”办法和确定专粮专用的管理制度以后，西峡县全县粮食局势空前稳定，社员个个喜气洋洋，种籽、饲料、储备都非常充足，食堂更是越办越好。
