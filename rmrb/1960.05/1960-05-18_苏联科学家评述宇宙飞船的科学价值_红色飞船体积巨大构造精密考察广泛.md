Xinhua News Agency, Moscow. Soviet scientists continue to publish comments in newspapers, evaluating the scientific value of the spaceship.

    Spaceship Lays the Foundation for Interstellar Travel

    Shevlyakov, Director of the Scientific Department of the Moscow Planetarium, emphasized that the Soviet satellite spaceship test will be recorded in the history of spaceflight as one of the final stages before the realization of human spaceflight. Its successful launch laid the foundation for the actual trial of human spaceflight. He also said that human flight to the moon will definitely be realized when science and technology can guarantee the full safety of the flight and a smooth return to Earth.

    Shevlyakov said that in realizing human spaceflight, a series of technical and medical-physiological problems still need to be solved. Technically, how to ensure a smooth return to Earth is the most difficult problem. In order to avoid extremely high temperatures during high-speed flight, the acceleration of the spaceship may need to be appropriately reduced.

    Shevlyakov said that the realization of spaceflight is not to make people abandon the cause of building a better life on Earth, but to discover new laws of nature, new secrets of the earth and the sky, so that people can live better on the ground.

    Feodorov, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, introduced that the basic part of the satellite spaceship launched this time is the manned cabin. This cabin is used to return the pilot to Earth. It can detach from the spaceship at any time when needed and return to Earth along a reliable parabola. Checking the device that detaches the cabin from the spaceship is one of the very important tasks of this satellite launch.

    Feodorov said that the brilliant achievements of Soviet rocket technology have made human interplanetary flight possible and have put the solution of this task on the agenda.

    The Spaceship Looks Like a Bright Star in the Sky

    The famous Soviet astronomer and Academician of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Barabashov, told a TASS reporter that the Soviet spaceship is huge and looks like a bright star in the sky, which may be easily observed with the naked eye.

    Barabashov said that the special cabin, weighing two and a half tons, is equipped with the same equipment that the first cosmonauts will be riding in the near future. The cabin is equipped with everything necessary for human travel safety, the sealing is reliable, and the necessary temperature is maintained inside the cabin. The satellite will also check the magnitude of the cosmic ray action force, and the instruments will send back to the ground information on how to maintain the necessary conditions during the flight.

    Barabashov emphasized that the successful launch of the Soviet spaceship opened a new stage in conquering the universe, and it is the largest man-made space body in the world. Now we can say with confidence that the date for humans to fly to the planets of the solar system is not far away.

    The Spaceship's Telephone Device is the First in the World

    The famous astronautics expert Sivrov published an article in the "Moscow Evening News" on the 16th, saying that this heavy satellite spaceship is equipped with a telephone communication device, which is the first time in the world.

    Academician Fesenkov pointed out that the huge weight of the satellite spaceship allows us to install some of the most sophisticated and various astronomical tools on the spaceship, so that we can solve some problems that ground observatories cannot solve at all. For example, to obtain large-format solar photographs, to study solar physics, especially the physics of solar radiation that is completely absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, huge possibilities are opened up. We can directly examine the interplanetary medium on the spaceship.

    苏联科学家评述宇宙飞船的科学价值
    红色飞船体积巨大构造精密考察广泛
    据新华社莫斯科电　苏联科学家继续在报纸上发表评论，评述宇宙飞船的科学价值。
    宇宙飞船为星际旅行奠立了开端
    莫斯科天文馆科学部主任谢夫利亚科夫着重指出，苏联卫星式飞船的试验将以实现人的宇宙飞行前的最后阶段之一而载入宇宙飞行史册。它的发射成功为实际试验人的宇宙飞行奠立了开端。他还说，人到月球的飞行在科学技术可以保证飞行者的充分安全和顺利返回地面时就一定会实现。
    谢夫利亚科夫说，在实现人的宇宙飞行方面目前还需要解决一系列技术问题和医学生理学问题。在技术问题上如何保证顺利返回地面是个最困难的问题，为了避免高速飞行时极高的温度，可能要适当降低宇宙飞船的加速度。
    谢夫利亚科夫说，实现宇宙飞行并不是要人们离开在地球上建立美好生活的事业，而是要发现自然的新规律，发现地和天的新秘密，以便使人们在地面上更好地生活。
    苏联科学院通讯院士费奥多罗夫介绍说，这次发射的卫星式飞船的基本部分是乘人的座舱。这个座舱是使飞行员返回地球用的。它可以在需要时刻脱离飞船，沿着可靠的抛物线返回地球。检查使座舱脱离飞船的装置，是这次发射卫星的十分重要的任务之一。
    费奥多罗夫说，苏联火箭技术的辉煌成就，已使人类行星际飞行有可能成为现实，并把这一任务的解决提到了日程上。
    宇宙飞船在天空中像一颗明亮的星
    苏联著名天文学家、乌克兰科学院院士巴拉巴绍夫对塔斯社记者说苏联宇宙飞船体积巨大，在天空中像一颗明亮的星星，用肉眼可能很容易地观测到。
    巴拉巴绍夫说，卫星装备的重两吨半的特制舱，同第一批宇宙飞行家在不久的将来将乘坐的是一样的。舱装备了人旅行安全所必须的一切装备，密封情况可靠，舱内保持着必要的温度。卫星还将检查宇宙线作用力量的大小，仪器将向地面送回如何可以在飞行期间维持必要条件的情报。
    巴拉巴绍夫强调指出，苏联宇宙飞船发射成功在征服宇宙方面打开了一个新阶段，它是世界上最大的人造宇宙体。现在可以满怀信心地说，人飞往太阳系行星的日期已经不远了。
    宇宙飞船电话装置是世界上第一次
    著名宇宙航行学专家西弗罗夫16日在“莫斯科晚报”发表文章说，在这个重型卫星式飞船上装备了电话联系装置，这还是世界上第一次。
    费辛科夫院士指出，卫星式飞船的巨大重量使我们可以在飞船上安装一些最精密的和各种各样的天文学工具，这样就可以解决地面观测台所根本不能解决的一些问题。例如，为获得大幅的太阳照片，为研究太阳物理学、特别是研究被地球大气层全部吸收掉的太阳辐射的物理学，展开了巨大的可能性。我们可以在飞船上直接考察行星际介质。
