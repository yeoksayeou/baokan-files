Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 22nd: After Eisenhower sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference, he wrote letters to the heads of government of several countries, counter-accusing Khrushchev of sabotaging the summit, in an attempt to escape the fierce condemnation of fair-minded public opinion in various countries.

According to the Associated Press, Eisenhower wrote letters with "mostly identical" content to "about two dozen foreign heads of government," including Franco of Spain, Karamanlis of Greece, and many Latin American heads of government. The report said that Eisenhower also wrote a letter to Indian Prime Minister Nehru.

According to reports, Eisenhower, in these letters, instead falsely accused the Soviet head of government of using the U.S. spy plane incident as a "pretext" to "sabotage" the summit conference.

He also used, again, the language of a robber, saying that the U.S. sending spy planes to the Soviet Union was "one of the forms of intelligence systems necessary" to "guard against" the so-called Soviet "sudden attack."

In his letters to Franco and Karamanlis, Eisenhower also took the opportunity to ask these subservient countries to be even more dependent on the United States.

    艾森豪威尔又说美机侵苏是“必需”的
    写信给许多国家首脑反噬苏联破坏首脑会议
    据新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔破坏了四国首脑会议之后，分别写信给一些国家的政府首脑，反噬赫鲁晓夫破坏首脑会议，企图逃避各国公正舆论的猛烈谴责。
    据美联社报道，艾森豪威尔写了内容“大部分相同”的信给“大约两打外国政府首脑”，其中包括西班牙的佛朗哥、希腊的卡拉曼利斯和许多拉丁美洲国家政府首脑。报道说，艾森豪威尔还写了一封信给印度总理尼赫鲁。
    据报道，艾森豪威尔在这些信中反而诬蔑苏联政府首脑“借口”美国间谍飞机事件“破坏”首脑会议。
    他还再次用强盗的语言说，美国派间谍飞机到苏联去是“防备”所谓苏联的“突然袭击所必需的情报体系的形式之一”。
    艾森豪威尔在给佛朗哥和卡拉曼利斯的信中还乘机要求这些仆从国家更加依附美国。
