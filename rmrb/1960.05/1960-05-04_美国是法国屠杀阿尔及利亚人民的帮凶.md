The United States is an Accomplice in France's Massacre of the Algerian People

For several years, the United States has consistently supported France's colonial war of aggression against Algeria in diplomatic, economic, and military terms. Since the United Nations General Assembly began discussing the Algerian question in September 1955, the United States has obstructed the General Assembly from taking actions that support the Algerian people's desire for independence in accordance with the principles stipulated in the Charter, and has voted against the proposals put forward by Asian and African countries aimed at stopping French aggression and demanding recognition of the Algerian people's right to self-determination every time. Not only that, but the United States has also repeatedly and publicly defended France's colonial war. At a press conference on July 4, 1957, Eisenhower even turned black and white upside down and said, "Legally speaking, Algeria is now considered an integral part of French metropolitan territory." Therefore, Democratic Senator Kennedy argued in a report to the U.S. Senate in 1957 that "people insist that this is a French internal affair." U.S. Under Secretary of State Dillon also stated that he opposed any act of "interfering in France's internal affairs."

At the same time, the United States has vigorously supported France's colonial war economically and with arms supplies. For example, in early 1958 alone, the United States gave France more than 600 million U.S. dollars in loans. The French aggressor army used a large number of American bombers, helicopters, and various military vehicles, as well as guns, etc. According to information in the memorandum of the Algerian National Liberation Front, from January 1955 to August 1956 alone, the United States supplied France with 150 helicopters, 50,000 automatic weapons, 26,000 military vehicles, and a large number of other military supplies. Former French Prime Minister Guy Mollet also publicly admitted that France was actually carrying out the Algerian colonial war with the help of the United States.

The purpose of the United States in supporting France's war of aggression against Algeria is, on the one hand, to suppress the Algerian national liberation movement, and on the other hand, to replace France. Dillon once bluntly said: "North Africa is the wing of France. If these wings are not clipped, this French rooster will always struggle to break free. These may be harsh words, but they very accurately express the essence of our country's diplomacy." The bosses on Wall Street have long coveted Algeria's underground resources. The British "Economist" magazine pointed out that when American oil monopolists heard that the Sahara's oil reserves were estimated to be as high as 3.5 billion barrels, their "ears perked up." In fact, American oil monopoly capital has already actively intervened in the exploitation of Sahara oil. American New Jersey Mobil Oil Company has signed an agreement with French oil companies to exploit Sahara oil and natural gas, with 50% of the investment provided by the United States. American Phillips Petroleum Company, Sinclair Oil Company, Indiana Mobil Oil Company, Townsward Oil Company, etc. have also successively obtained concessions for Sahara oil fields. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Panfield said nakedly in a report on "America's Mission in Africa": "Africa—especially the sub-Saharan desert—supplies the United States with extremely important raw materials, such as uranium, cobalt, diamonds, iron ore, gold, and manganese, etc." The United States also attempts to use Algeria to strengthen its strategic position in North Africa and the Mediterranean. The "U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings" published an article in its July 1957 issue stating: "The Algerian question is no longer just a colonial question. It has now also become a political and strategic question." The magazine continued: "For the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Algeria is important because Western Europe lacks in-depth defense on its southern flank, and Western Europe loses its primary strategic position in the Mediterranean."

All these facts irrefutably prove that the U.S. imperialists bear the serious responsibility of helping the French colonialists massacre the Algerian people, and it is the main accomplice in France's war of aggression against Algeria. The "Algerian News Bulletin" revealed in its September issue last year: "The United States is best at using empty words to maintain and support the policies of human freedom and the right of people to self-determination, while at the same time supporting its imperialist ally, French imperialism, with actions." Even U.S. Congressman Bolton had to admit that Algerians believe that Americans are truly "helping the French firmly eliminate any freedom in Algeria."

### 美国是法国屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的帮凶

    美国是法国屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的帮凶
    几年来，美国一贯在外交、经济和军事方面支持法国侵略阿尔及利亚的殖民战争。自从1955年9月联合国大会开始讨论阿尔及利亚问题起，美国一直阻挠联大根据宪章规定的原则来采取支持阿尔及利亚人民独立愿望的行动，每次都投票反对亚非国家提出的目的在于制止法国侵略、要求承认阿尔及利亚人民享有自决权的提案。不仅如此，美国还一再公开地为法国的殖民战争辩解。艾森豪威尔1957年7月4日在记者招待会上竟颠倒黑白地说：“从法律上说，阿尔及利亚现在被认为是法国本土领土的整体一部分”。因此，美国民主党参议员肯尼迪在1957年向美国参议院提出的一份报告中就强词夺理地说：“人们坚持这是一个法国内政的问题”。美国副国务卿狄龙也曾表示，反对任何“干涉法国内政”的行为。
    与此同时，美国还在经济上和军火供应上大力支持法国进行殖民战争。如单在1958年初，美国就给予法国六亿多美元的贷款。法国侵略军大量使用美国的轰炸机、直升飞机和各种军用车辆以及枪枝等等。根据阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的备忘录上的资料，仅在1955年1月到1956年8月期间，美国就供给法国一百五十架直升飞机、五万件自动武器、二万六千辆军用汽车和大量其它军用品。法国前总理盖伊阿也曾公开承认，法国其实是在美国的援助下进行阿尔及利亚殖民战争的。
    美国支持法国侵阿战争的目的，一方面是镇压阿尔及利亚民族解放运动，另方面是取法国而代之。狄龙就曾露骨地说过：“北非是法国的翅膀，如果这些翅膀不被剪去，这只法国雄鸡总是要努力挣脱的。这些可能是刺耳的话，但是它们非常确切地表达了我国外交的实质。”美国华尔街的老板们对阿尔及利亚的地下资源，早已垂涎三尺。英国“经济学家”周刊指出，当美国石油垄断资本家听到撒哈拉的石油储藏量估计高达三十五亿桶时，他们的“耳朵都竖了起来”。其实，美国的石油垄断资本已经积极插手撒哈拉石油的开采。美国新泽西美孚油公司已经同法国的石油公司签订了开采撒哈拉石油和天然气的协定，投资的50％由美国提供。美国菲利浦石油公司、辛克莱石油公司、印第安纳美孚油公司、唐斯瓦德石油公司等也先后获得了撒哈拉油田的租让权。美国负责非洲事务的助理国务卿帮办潘菲尔德在一篇关于“美国在非洲的任务”的报告中，赤裸裸地说：“非洲——特别是下撒哈拉沙漠一带——供应美国的极端重要的原料，如铀、钴、金刚石、铁矿、黄金和锰等”。美国还企图利用阿尔及利亚来加强它在北非和地中海的战略地位。“美国海军学会纪要”1957年7月号载文说：“阿尔及利亚问题不再单是殖民地问题。现在也成了一个政治和战略问题。”这家杂志继续说：“对于北大西洋公约组织来说，阿尔及利亚是重要的，因为西欧在南部侧翼缺少纵深的防御力量，西欧便丧失了它在地中海的首要战略地位”。
    这一切事实，无可辩驳地证明，美帝国主义者负有帮助法国殖民者屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的严重罪责，它是法国侵略阿尔及利亚战争的主要帮凶。“阿尔及利亚新闻公报”去年9月号中就曾揭露：“美国最善于用空话来维护、支持人类自由和人民自决权利的政策，而同时却用行动来支持它的帝国主义盟国法帝国主义者”。甚至美国众议员波尔顿也不得不承认，阿尔及利亚人认为美国人是在真正“帮助法国人坚决消灭阿尔及利亚的任何自由”。
