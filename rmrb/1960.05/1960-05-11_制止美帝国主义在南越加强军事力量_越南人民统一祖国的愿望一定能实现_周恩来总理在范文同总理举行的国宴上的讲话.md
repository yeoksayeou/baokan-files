Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the State Banquet Hosted by Premier Pham Van Dong
Dear Comrade President Ho Chi Minh, Dear Comrade Premier Pham Van Dong, Dear Comrades and Friends:
Premier Pham Van Dong has given us such a grand and warm banquet, giving us the opportunity to gather with our dear Vietnamese comrades and friends, for which we feel very honored and happy. Please allow me, on behalf of Comrade Chen Yi and myself, to express our heartfelt thanks to the host of today's banquet, and at the same time to extend our sincere greetings to all the comrades and friends present.
After visiting four friendly countries, Comrade Chen Yi and I have once again come to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for a friendly visit, and we feel particularly cordial and happy. We feel cordial because we are meeting with old friends we have not seen for a long time, and we are with the fraternal Vietnamese people; when we arrive in Vietnam, it is as if we have returned to our own home. We are happy because the diligent and brave Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, have not only completed the task of economic recovery, but have also achieved a series of victories in realizing the three-year plan for developing and transforming the economy and developing culture. These victories have laid the foundation for the construction of socialism in North Vietnam, demonstrating the great enthusiasm and creativity that the Vietnamese people can unleash under the socialist system. Our visit this time is also taking place after the Vietnamese people have victoriously conducted the second National Assembly election and are launching a warm socialist emulation campaign to welcome the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and also on the eve of the 70th birthday of the Vietnamese people's beloved leader, President Ho Chi Minh. It is very precious for us to be with the Vietnamese people in such a vibrant and joyous time. Here, on behalf of the Chinese people, I wish President Ho Chi Minh lasting youth and boundless longevity. I wish the fraternal Vietnamese people even more brilliant achievements in the cause of building socialism.
Three and a half years have passed since my last visit to your country. During this period, the construction cause of our two countries has developed greatly, and at the same time, the entire international situation has undergone tremendous changes that are conducive to world peace, national independence, and socialism. The strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become even stronger, the national democratic revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging forward, and the struggle of the people of all countries in the world for peace and democracy is constantly rising; while the imperialist camp is increasingly falling into a state of disunity and facing numerous difficulties. Thanks to the joint efforts of the socialist camp and all peace-loving forces in the world, the international situation has seen a certain degree of relaxation, which is encouraging to our two countries and all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world. However, the imperialist aggression group headed by the United States has not laid down its butcher knife; on the contrary, they are using this situation to continue expanding their arms and preparing for war, continue strengthening military alliances, continue establishing military bases, actively reviving West German and Japanese militarism, obstructing universal disarmament in various ways, and carrying out blatant military provocations in many parts of the world. Imperialism is, after all, imperialism; their nature will not change. But on the other hand, as long as the imperialists' threats, oppression, exploitation, plunder, and interference against the people of all countries in the world still exist, the struggle of the people of all countries against imperialism and its lackeys will not stop. The recent struggles of the people of South Korea and the people of Turkey eloquently prove this point. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out a few days ago, this struggle of the people of South Korea and the people of Turkey shows that the storm of the struggle of the oppressed people of Asian countries against imperialism and its lackeys will rise even more greatly. The days of imperialism are getting harder and harder, and the prospects for winning lasting world peace have never been as favorable as they are today. In order to strive for lasting world peace and promote human progress, the Chinese people will, together with the Vietnamese people, together with the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and together with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, make unremitting efforts.
The increasingly blatant U.S. interference in South Vietnam is one aspect of the U.S. stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations around the world. We clearly remember the solemn guarantee made by the U.S. government at the 1954 Geneva Conference not to use force to hinder the Geneva Accords. However, recently the U.S. government has gone even further in attempting to collude with the South Vietnamese authorities to increase the number of military aid advisors it has illegally entered into South Vietnam, in order to further turn South Vietnam into a U.S. military base and colony. This is the latest in a series of U.S. actions over the past six years to undermine the Geneva Accords. We fully support the position of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding stopping the United States from strengthening its military forces in South Vietnam. The increasingly blatant U.S. interference in South Vietnam can only arouse resistance from the people of South Vietnam, ultimately leading to the opposite of what the United States wants. We firmly believe that the sacred desire of the Vietnamese people to reunify their fatherland will surely be realized.
The friendship between our two countries, China and Vietnam, is built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism and is unbreakable. Since the 1957 Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries, the friendly relations between our two countries have been further developed on the basis of the Moscow Declaration. Our mutual assistance and cooperation in politics, economy, culture, science, and technology have become closer. We have consistently supported each other in the struggle against imperialist aggression and war, and in safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. Our mutual support and mutual learning in the cause of building socialism have been continuously strengthened, and the friendly exchanges between our two governments and peoples have become increasingly frequent. Last year, President Ho Chi Minh, respected by the Chinese people, personally led the Vietnamese Party and Government Delegation to participate in our country's celebration of the 10th anniversary of its founding. This was a great encouragement to the Chinese people who are striving to accelerate the building of socialism. Our mutual assistance and cooperation not only promote the common high tide of the two countries' economies and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp, but also contribute to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people will always advance hand in hand with the diligent and brave Vietnamese people in the noble cause of building socialism, striving for human progress, and safeguarding world peace.
Now, I propose a toast:
To the prosperity of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam,
To the eternal fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam,
To the great unity

    制止美帝国主义在南越加强军事力量
    越南人民统一祖国的愿望一定能实现
    周恩来总理在范文同总理举行的国宴上的讲话亲爱的胡志明主席同志，亲爱的范文同总理同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    范文同总理为我们举行这样一个隆重、热烈的宴会，使我们有机会同亲爱的越南同志们和朋友们欢聚一堂，我们感到非常荣幸和愉快。请允许我以陈毅同志和我个人的名义，向今天宴会的主人表示衷心的感谢，同时向在座的全体同志们和朋友们表示热诚的问候。
    我和陈毅同志在访问了四个友好的国家之后，再一次来到越南民主共和国进行友好访问，感到特别的亲切和特别的高兴。我们感到亲切，因为我们是和久别的老朋友相会，是和兄弟的越南人民在一起，我们到了越南就好像回到了自己的家里一样。我们感到高兴，因为勤劳勇敢的越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，不仅已经完成了经济恢复的任务，而且在实现发展、改造经济和发展文化的三年计划方面也取得了一系列的胜利。这些胜利奠定了越南北方建设社会主义的基础，显示出在社会主义制度下越南人民所能发挥的巨大积极性和创造力。我们这次访问，又正在越南人民胜利地进行了第二届国会选举之后和为迎接越南民主共和国建国十五周年展开热烈的社会主义竞赛的时候，同时也是越南人民敬爱的领袖胡志明主席七旬大庆的前夕。我们能够在这样一个朝气勃勃、喜气洋洋的日子里同越南人民在一起，是非常可贵的。在这里，我谨代表中国人民祝胡志明主席青春长在，万寿无疆。祝兄弟的越南人民在建设社会主义的事业中获得更加辉煌的成绩。
    自从我上次访问你们的国家以来，三年半的时间已经过去了。在这个期间，我们两国的建设事业都有了巨大的发展，同时，整个国际形势也发生了有利于世界和平、民族独立和社会主义的巨大变化。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量更加强大，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动风起云涌，世界各国人民争取和平民主的斗争不断高涨；而帝国主义阵营则日益陷于四分五裂，困难重重的境地。由于社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平力量的共同努力，国际局势出现了一定程度的和缓，这是我们两国和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民所共同感到鼓舞的。但是以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团并没有放下屠刀，相反，他们利用这种局势继续扩军备战，继续加强军事同盟，继续建立军事基地，积极复活西德和日本军国主义，多方阻挠普遍裁军，并且在世界许多地区进行露骨的军事挑衅。帝国主义终究是帝国主义，他们的本性是不会变的。但是另一方面，只要帝国主义对世界各国人民的威胁、压迫、剥削、掠夺和干涉还存在，世界各国人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争就不会停止。最近发生的南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民的斗争，雄辩地证明了这一点。正如毛泽东同志在前几天所指出的，南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民的这种斗争，表明亚洲各国受压迫人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴还将有更大的兴起。帝国主义的日子越来越不好过，争取世界持久和平的前景从来没有像今天这样有利。为了争取世界持久和平、促进人类进步，中国人民将同越南人民一道，同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国一道，同全世界所有爱好和平的国家和人民一道作出坚持不懈的努力。
    美国对越南南部越来越露骨的干涉，是美国在世界各地加紧扩军备战的一个侧面。我们清楚地记得美国政府在1954年日内瓦会议上关于不使用武力妨害日内瓦协议的庄严保证。但是最近美国政府竟变本加厉企图伙同南越当局增加它非法进入南越的军事援助顾问团人员，以便进一步把南越变成美国的军事基地和殖民地。这是六年来美国一连串破坏日内瓦协议的行为中的最近一次。我们完全支持越南民主共和国政府关于制止美国在南越加强军事力量的主张，美国对南越越来越露骨的干涉，只能激起越南南部人民的反抗，最后走向美国愿望的反面。我们坚决相信，越南人民统一祖国的神圣愿望一定能够实现。
    我们中越两国的友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础之上的，是牢不可破的。自从1957年社会主义国家共产党和工人党的莫斯科会议以来，我们两国的友好关系在莫斯科宣言的基础上又有了进一步的发展。我们两国在政治、经济、文化、科学和技术等方面的互助合作更加密切。我们在反对帝国主义的侵略和战争，维护亚洲和世界和平的斗争中一贯互相支持。我们在建设社会主义事业中的相互支援和相互学习不断加强，我们两国政府和人民之间的友好来往日益频繁。去年，中国人民所敬爱的胡志明主席亲自率领越南党政代表团，参加了我国建国十周年的庆祝活动。这对于正在为加速建设社会主义而奋斗的中国人民是一个莫大的鼓舞。我们之间的互助合作，不仅促进了两国经济的共同高涨，加强了社会主义阵营的团结，同时也有利于维护亚洲和世界和平。中国人民将永远同勤劳勇敢的越南人民一起，在建设社会主义、争取人类进步和维护世界和平的崇高事业中携手前进。
    现在，我提议：
    为越南民主共和国的繁荣昌盛，
    为中越两国人民永恒的兄弟友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，
    为亚洲和世界和平，
    为范文同总理的健康，
    为胡志明主席的健康和长寿，
    干杯！
