    Technical Revolution Movement Creates High-Speed Production
    A Batch of Factories and Mines Fulfill First-Half Production Targets Ahead of Schedule
    Shandong Small Coal Mines
    (This newspaper reports) As of May 15th, Shandong Province's local small coal mines had produced 2.51 million tons of coal, fulfilling 51.28% of the annual target.
    At the beginning of this year, the workers and staff of Shandong Province's local small coal mines launched a "Four Comparisons" red flag competition movement centered on "Five Improvements" (improving development methods, mining methods, tools and equipment, working conditions, and transportation), and vigorously engaged in technical revolution. Currently, 66 pairs of mines in the province's small coal mines have achieved rational development and changed the practice of replacing mining with excavation. There are 33 working faces adopting new mining methods, and the output has generally increased by about double. Many mines have basically achieved mechanization or semi-mechanization of hoisting, and the track-laying of transportation, greatly improving hoisting and transportation capacity. Eighty-five pairs of small coal mines have reached the technical level of "small foreign groups". Significant achievements have also been made in the substitution and conservation of pit props. The consumption of pit props per 1,000 tons of coal produced in the province's small coal mines has decreased from 22 cubic meters last year to 8.65 cubic meters, and there are already four mines, fifteen wells, thirty-one mining working faces, and fifty-three tunneling faces that have basically achieved pit prop-free operation.
    Luoyang Bearing Factory
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, May 25th: The Luoyang Bearing Factory completed the state production plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule on May 18th. Compared with the same period last year, the average daily output of bearings increased by 146.9%, costs decreased by 23.7%, profits increased by 3.9 times, and the average monthly labor productivity increased by 154.5%. The variety of products increased from 393 at the end of last year to 499.
    At the beginning of this year, the factory's workers and staff launched a vigorous technical revolution movement. According to statistics on May 17th, 74% of the factory's main process equipment has achieved automated and semi-automated production. The in-depth development of the technical revolution movement has promoted a multiple, dozens, or even hundreds-fold increase in production efficiency, and greatly improved product quality. In the past, the soft grinding section of the roller workshop used manual loading, which often "couldn't eat" the work from the previous process and "couldn't feed" the work to the next process, becoming a weak link in the entire workshop. However, after realizing the automation of the aerial feeding of the unit, the output doubled, labor was saved by 30%, and it jumped to become the most advanced section in the workshop.
    Shenyang Glass Instrument Factory
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 25th: The Shenyang Glass Instrument Factory has already achieved the goal of "completing half of the annual plan in the first half of the year" ahead of schedule. As of May 13th, the total output value completed by the factory has exceeded the first-half plan by 34.24%, equivalent to 58.18% of the annual plan.
    At the beginning of this year, the factory's workers and staff widely launched a technical revolution movement. The factory's original main workshops and processes were all manual operations and heavy labor. Some large instruments, containers, and glass products were all made by blowing with the mouth and pulling by hand. After vigorously engaging in technical innovation, the factory manufactured nearly a hundred sets of equipment such as bottle blowing machines, tube drawing machines, graduating machines, and grinding machines, basically realizing that bottle blowing does not require the mouth, and tube drawing and grinding do not require hands, greatly improving labor efficiency. At the beginning of the year, an eight-person tube drawing team could only produce more than 200 kilograms of glass tubes a day by manual drawing. After using machine production, the number of people was reduced by half, but the output more than doubled.
    Fushun Safety Instrument Factory
    Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, May 25th: The Fushun Safety Instrument Factory of the Ministry of Coal Industry completed the first-half plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target on May 20th. The total output value exceeded the first-half plan by 11.7%, the output of major products exceeded 43.3%, and costs decreased by 7%.
    Since the beginning of this year, the Fushun Safety Instrument Factory has widely mobilized the masses to vigorously engage in technical revolution. The factory's workers and staff regarded solving the problem of insufficient raw materials and equipment as the main direction of attack, and adopted the method of batches and battles to break through a batch and promote a batch. The factory has self-made 92 various small special-purpose machine tools, mainly using indigenous methods, thus effectively guaranteeing production.
    Zhuge Temple Coal Mine
    (This newspaper reports) As of May 12th, the Zhuge Temple Coal Mine in Pingdingshan, Henan Province, had completed 54.9% of the annual state plan, an increase of 99.9% over the same period last year. Overall efficiency increased by 70%, pit prop consumption decreased by 38.48%, and the cost per ton of coal decreased by 25.94%.
    Since the beginning of this year, the workers and staff of the Zhuge Temple Mine have deeply carried out the technical revolution movement around the key to production, enabling the mechanization and semi-mechanization of coal mining, tunneling, and transportation. While vigorously engaging in technical revolution, they vigorously carried out single-person class ten-meter races, team class hundred-meter races, thousand-ton working face competitions, on-site skill competitions, and skill pacesetter selection competitions between people, groups, classes, and districts. At present, 50% of the mine's coal miners have reached the level of more than ten meters per class.
    Now, the workers and staff of the Zhuge Temple Mine are fighting hard in the Red May, striving to complete 72% of the annual state plan in the first half of the year, and fighting heroically to complete the annual state plan four months ahead of schedule. (Attached picture)

    技术革命运动创造生产高速度
    一批厂矿提前完成上半年生产任务
    山东小煤矿
    本报讯　截至15日止，山东省地方小型煤矿已产煤二百五十一万吨，完成了全年任务的51.28％。
    今年年初，山东省地方小型煤矿职工就深入开展了以“五改”（改进开拓方法、采煤方法、工具设备、劳动条件、运输）为中心的“四比”
  （比产量、劳动效率、成本、安全生产）红旗竞赛运动，大搞技术革命。目前，全省小煤窑实现合理开拓、改变以掘代采的矿井已有六十六对，采取新法采煤的工作面有三十三个，产量一般都提高了一倍左右。许多矿井已经基本实现了提升机械化或半机械化，运输轨道化，大大提高了提升运输能力。已有八十五对小煤井达到“小洋群”技术水平。坑木代用和节约也取得了显著成绩，全省小煤矿每产一千吨煤耗坑木量，由去年的二十二立方降到八点六五立方，并且已有四个矿、十五个井、三十一个采煤工作面、五十三个掘进迎头基本上实现了无坑木。
    洛阳轴承厂
    据新华社郑州25日电　洛阳轴承厂于5月18日提前完成了上半年国家生产计划。与去年同期比较，轴承平均日产量增长146.9％，成本降低23.7％，利润增加三点九倍，月平均劳动生产率提高154.5％；产品种类由去年年底的三百九十三种增加到四百九十九种。
    这个厂的职工今年一开始就展开了轰轰烈烈的技术革命运动。到5月17日统计，全厂74％的主要工艺设备已经实现了自动化和半自动化生产。技术革命运动的深入开展，促进了生产效率成倍、成几十倍至百倍的提高，产品质量大大改善。滚子车间软磨工部以往用人工装料，往往对上道工序下来的活
  “吃不了”，对下道工序的活又
  “供不饱”，成为全车间的薄弱环节；但是在实现机组空中送料自动化以后，产量提高了二倍，劳力节约了30％，一跃而成为车间最先进的工部。
  沈阳玻璃仪器厂
    据新华社沈阳25日电　沈阳市玻璃仪器厂已经提前实现了“半年完成全年计划一半”的奋斗目标。到5月13日止，这个厂完成的总产值已经超过上半年计划34.24％，等于全年计划的58.18％。
    今年一开始，这个厂的职工就广泛地展开了技术革命运动。工厂原来的主要车间和工序都是手工操作和笨重劳动，一些大的仪器、容器和玻璃等产品，都是人工用嘴吹、手拉制成的，大闹技术革新后，全厂造出了吹瓶机、拉管机、刻度机、研磨机等近百台设备，基本上实现了吹瓶不用嘴，拉管、研磨不用手，大大提高了劳动效率。年初，一个拉管小组八名工人，靠人力拉管，一天只能制出二百多公斤玻璃管，使用机器生产后，人数减少一半，产量却提高一倍多。
  抚顺安全仪器厂
    据新华社抚顺25日电　煤炭工业部抚顺安全仪器厂在5月20日提前超额完成了上半年计划。总产值超过上半年计划11.7％，主要产品产量超过43.3％，成本降低7％。
    抚顺安全仪器厂从今年年初起，就广泛发动群众大闹技术革命。全厂职工把解决原料材料和设备不足的问题作为主攻方向，并且采取分批、分战役的办法，突破一批，推广一批。全厂以土办法为主自制的各种小型专用机床就有九十二台，因此有效地保证了生产。
    诸葛庙煤矿
    本报讯　河南省平顶山诸葛庙煤矿，截至5月12日，已完成全年国家计划的54.9％，比去年同期提高99.9％，全员效率增长70％，坑木消耗降低38.48％，吨煤成本下降25.94％。
    今年以来，诸葛庙矿职工，围绕生产关键深入开展了技术革命运动，使采煤、掘进、运输实现了机械化和半机械化。在大闹技术革命的同时，大力开展了人与人、组与组、班与班、区与区之间的单人班采十米赛、小组班采百米赛、千吨工作面竞赛、现场比武赛、工种标兵选拔赛等。目前全矿有50％的采煤工人达到了班采十米以上的水平。
    现在，诸葛庙矿职工正在大战红五月，力争在上半年完成全年国家计划72％，提前四个月完成全年国家计划而英勇奋战。（附图片）
