Party Secretary's Notes

    Laborers are the Smartest People
    Yuan Xianqian, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Dalian Shipyard
    Daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act,
    Like three atomic bombs,
    Smashing open the shackles of thousands of years of superstition,
    Shattering ten thousand years of feelings of inferiority,
    Without machines, use your brains,
    Everyone pitches in to offer treasures.
    These are the bold words of our contemporary heroes.
    As soon as you enter the gate of the Dalian Shipyard, you are greeted by huge banners reading "Work hard for two months, give the old factory a new look, basically achieve mechanization, and old soldiers get new guns," and colorful, dazzling big-character posters about new products, new technologies, new inventions, new creations, and new records. On the towering gantry cranes, slogans and catchphrases of technical innovation and technical revolution are hung like lanterns and colored streamers. Everyone is engaged in innovation and thinking of ways. All the employees of the factory have plunged into the vigorous technical revolution movement. It is truly a scene of a hundred flowers blooming and a riot of color.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, the workers of the Dalian Shipyard, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, have launched a mass movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. In two years, they have put forward more than 100,000 innovation proposals, overcome numerous difficulties such as shortages of raw materials, materials, electricity, manpower, and equipment, and completed the state plan fully two months and five days ahead of schedule, manufacturing high-quality, sophisticated, and advanced new products at high speed.
    "To see a thousand miles, ascend another story." In order to achieve a sustained Great Leap Forward in the 1960s, it is necessary to meet the needs of the new stage of socialist construction with an even higher shipbuilding speed. Thus, the mass technical innovation and technical revolution entered a new stage centered on changing the face of the old factory. From November last year to today, the workers of the entire factory have put forward tens of thousands of innovation proposals for achieving mechanization, automation, and electrification, and many have been adopted. The degree of mechanization of various types of work in the factory has been greatly improved. Automatic and semi-automatic production lines, production linkage lines, and automated sections have emerged. The mass technical transformation movement is like a rocket just leaving the ground, flying higher and higher, and the speed is getting faster and faster. Everywhere is a scene of prosperity. Production has increased, but not only has a single person not been added, but a large number of laborers have been saved to support brother factories and mines. At the same time, thousands of workers have been relieved of heavy physical labor. Removing rust from steel plates has historically been done by workers using hammers in the Dalian Shipyard. Later, a big step forward was made by using pneumatic derusting, but the workers still had to use broken grinding wheels and sandpaper to grind away the rust on the iron plates bit by bit. The efficiency was low, and the rust particles affected the workers' health. In this technical transformation movement, the workers set lofty ambitions and vowed to climb the peak of science and technology, and have already mechanized the rust removal work.
    The broad masses of workers with soaring ambitions are determined to use their own hands to transform our ancient shipyard into a modern shipyard equipped with the latest technology in the world in a very short period of time. This is not a myth, nor is it a distant ideal, but a great cause that is underway. Taking the workshop as an example, since the technical transformation of the steel casting workshop, the workers of this workshop, with the support and assistance of brother workshops, have successively manufactured some indigenous and foreign machines, and improved the electric furnace, so that the charging, smelting, and even tapping of the steel water from the electric furnace have all been automated and semi-automated. As a result, the degree of mechanization of this workshop has increased rapidly. Originally, the sand and soil in this workshop were piled up like mountains, and the site was dusty, and the workers were all black-faced. Now they are carrying out a technical transformation as beautiful as a picture, basically eliminating heavy physical labor, and have established underground sections, installed glass roofs, producing underground, planting flowers on the ground, warm in winter and cool in summer, and spring all year round.
    With the deepening development of the technical transformation movement, people are increasingly clearly aware of the correctness of the truth that "all scientific and technological principles come from practice." The broad masses of workers dare to think of things that predecessors have not thought of, and dare to do things that predecessors have not done. They boldly innovate, and while enriching and modifying those principles and conclusions that are lagging behind practice and have become outdated, the new atmosphere and new deeds of invention and creation are surging up and emerging one after another. Liang Runzhong, an old worker and Communist Party member nearly half a century old, was an illiterate in the old society, but now he has become a famous inventor in the factory. More than 140 machines have been manufactured under his hands. When others ask him how he came up with those machines, he always smiles and says: "Production needs forced people to think them up."
    This sentence from the old worker illustrates a truth—laborers are the smartest people. It tells us once again that in an enterprise, as long as the leadership can let go and mobilize the masses, and can "come from the masses and go to the masses," combining the practical work and skillful work of the broad masses of workers, then the power generated by the wisdom of the masses is endless. There will be no problem in developing production at high speed and continuously achieving a Great Leap Forward.

    劳动者是最聪明的人
    中共大连造船厂委员会书记　原宪千
    敢想敢说又敢干，
    好似三颗原子弹，
    砸开千年迷信锁，
    打掉万年自卑感，
    没有机器动脑筋，
    大家动手把宝献。
    这是我们当代英雄们的豪言壮语。
    当您一走进大连造船厂的大门，“大干两个月，老厂换新装，基本实现机械化，老兵拿新枪”的巨幅标语和五色缤纷琳琅满目的关于新产品、新技术、新发明、新创造和新纪录的大字报就映入眼帘。在高大耸天的塔吊上，也悬灯挂彩似的贴满了技术革新和技术革命的标语和口号。人人闹革新、个个想门道。全厂职工都投入到轰轰烈烈的技术革命运动中去。真是百花盛开，万紫千红。
    自从大跃进以来，大连造船厂职工就根据党中央和毛主席的指示，开展了以技术革新和技术革命为中心内容的群众运动。在两年内共提出革新建议十几万件，克服了原料、材料、电力、人力和设备不足的重重困难，提前两个月零五天全面地完成了国家计划，高速优质地制造出高大精尖新产品。
    “欲穷千里目，更上一层楼”。为了实现六十年代的持续大跃进，必须以更高的造船速度满足社会主义建设新阶段的需要。于是群众性的技术革新和技术革命，进入了以改变老工厂面貌为中心的新阶段。从去年11月到今天，全厂职工共提出实现机械化、自动化和电气化的革新建议好几万条，采纳了很多。使全厂各种工种的机械化程度大大提高。出现了自动、半自动作业线、生产联动线和自动化工段。群众性的技术改造运动像初离地面的火箭，越飞越高，速度也越来越快。到处都是欣欣向荣的景象。生产增加了，但是不仅没有增加一个人，反倒节省了大批劳动力，支援了兄弟厂矿。同时，更使好几千名工人减轻了体力劳动。钢板除锈在大连造船厂有史以来都是工人用锤敲打，后来前进了一大步，改用风动打锈，但工人还得用碎砂轮、砂布一点一点的磨去铁板上的铁锈，效率低，铁锈微粒影响工人的身体健康。在这次技术改造运动中，工人们立雄心，树大志，誓攀科学技术顶峰，已经使除锈工作机械化了。
    抱有凌云壮志的广大职工群众，决心要用自己的双手，把我们这座古老的造船厂，在很短的时期里变为世界上有最新技术装备起来的一座现代化造船厂。这不是神话，这也不是远大的理想，而是正在进行着的伟大事业。就以车间为例，铸钢车间在技术改造以来，这个车间的职工，在兄弟车间的支援与协助下，先后制出一些土洋机器，并改进电炉，使电炉上料，熔炼直到出钢水，全部实现了自动化和半自动化。于是这个车间的机械化程度就迅速增长。原来这个车间的砂土堆积如山，现场尘土飞扬，工人都是黑脸的。现在他们正在进行着景美如画的技术改造，基本消灭重体力劳动，已经建立地下工段，安装玻璃房盖，在地下生产，地上种花，冬暖夏凉，四季常春。
    随着技术改造运动的深入发展，人们越来越清楚地认识到“一切科学技术原理都来源于实践”这一真理的正确性。广大职工们敢于想前人所未想的事，敢于做前人所未做的事。他们大胆地革新，在丰富和修改了那些落后于实践、已经过时了的原理和结论的同时，发明创造的新风气和新事迹风起云涌，层出不穷。年近半百的老工人、共产党员梁润忠，在旧社会是个只字不识的文盲，现在已成为全厂闻名的发明家。在他手下制造出来的机器达一百四十多项。别人问他是怎么想出那些机器来的，他总是笑着说：“生产需要，逼着人想出来的”。
    老工人的这一句话，说明了一个真理——劳动者是最聪明的人。他再一次地告诉我们，在企业里，只要领导上能够放手发动群众，并能够“从群众中来，到群众中去”，使广大职工群众的实干和巧干结合起来，那么，群众的智慧所产生的力量，是无穷无尽的。生产高速度地发展、持续不断地大跃进，都是不成问题的。
