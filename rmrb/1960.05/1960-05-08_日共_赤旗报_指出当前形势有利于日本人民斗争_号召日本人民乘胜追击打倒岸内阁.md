Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th. The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata" published an editorial today calling on all JCP members to unite the Japanese people and launch a larger-scale unified action to crush the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to approve the new "Security Treaty" and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

The editorial pointed out that the fifteenth national unified action of the Japanese people to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and the struggle of the masses on the "May Day" International Labor Day have thwarted the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party's conspiracy to forcibly approve the new "Security Treaty," and opened up a new favorable situation for further launching a more powerful struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," dissolve the Diet, and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

"Akahata" emphasized that the situation in which the foundation of U.S. imperialism's rule in various parts of Asia has begun to shake has encouraged the development of the Japanese people's unified action and is conducive to the Japanese people's struggle.

The editorial pointed out that under the current situation, the urgent political task of all democratic forces in Japan is to further pursue the victory based on the achievements of the fifteenth unified action. The goal of this pursuit is to expose the essence of the two enemies—U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet—to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," to force the dissolution of the Diet, and to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

The editorial expressed support for the National Conference Against Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty's" recent announcement regarding the guidelines for the sixteenth unified action.

The editorial called on all JCP members to strive wholeheartedly for the victory of the struggle. The editorial called on JCP members to stand at the forefront of the campaign to collect ten million signatures and strive to complete the task ahead of schedule. At the same time, it is necessary to organize more farmers, women, and citizens to participate in petitions to the Diet and to raise political vigilance.

"Akahata" also emphasized that the current massive unified action of the Japanese people to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," demand the dissolution of the Diet, and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is the first step in the great struggle to prevent the establishment of a Japan-U.S. anti-communist military alliance and prevent the revival of militarism, and to strive for the establishment of a peaceful, independent, democratic, neutral, and prosperous Japan. If the current unified action can develop into a genuine national democratic united front, then the possibility of fundamentally changing the Japanese political situation will increase day by day.

    日共“赤旗报”指出当前形势有利于日本人民斗争
    号召日本人民乘胜追击打倒岸内阁
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日共全体党员团结日本人民展开更大规模的统一行动，为粉碎岸信介政府批准新“安全条约”的阴谋和打倒岸信介内阁而斗争。
    社论指出，日本人民举行的第十五次阻止批准新“安全条约”全国统一行动和“五一”国际劳动节群众的斗争，使岸信介政府和自由民主党强行批准新“安全条约”的阴谋遭到挫折，为进一步发动更加强大的阻止批准新“安全条约”、解散国会和打倒岸信介内阁的斗争开辟了新的有利的局面。
    “赤旗报”强调指出，美帝国主义在亚洲各地的统治基础开始大动摇的这种形势，鼓舞了日本人民的统一行动的发展，利于日本人民的斗争。
    社论指出，在目前形势下，日本全体民主力量的紧要政治课题是以第十五次统一行动的成就为基础，进一步追击下去。这种追击的目标是揭露两个敌人——美帝国主义和岸信介内阁的本质，阻止批准新“安全条约”，迫使解散国会和打倒岸信介内阁。
    社论表示支持阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议最近发表的关于第十六次统一行动的方针。
    社论号召日共全体党员全力为争取斗争的胜利而奋斗。社论号召日共党员在征集一千万名签名运动中站在前列，争取提前完成任务。同时，组织更多的农民、妇女和市民参加向国会的请愿，并且提高政治警惕性。
    “赤旗报”还强调指出，日本人民目前展开的阻止批准新“安全条约”、要求解散国会、打倒岸信介内阁的声势浩大的统一行动，是阻止建立日美反共军事同盟和阻止复活军国主义，争取建立和平、独立、民主、中立和繁荣的日本的伟大斗争的第一个步骤。如果目前的统一行动能够发展成为真正的民族民主统一战线，那么，根本改变日本政治形势的可能性就会日益增大。
