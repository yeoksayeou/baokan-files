Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd: Washington dispatch: As the East-West summit meeting is about to be held, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution on May 2nd to poison the atmosphere of the meeting, ridiculously demanding that Eisenhower "seek to restore" so-called "basic freedoms" to the socialist countries of Eastern Europe at the summit meeting.

The drafter of the resolution, Representative Zablocki, stated in his speech that the purpose of the House of Representatives passing this resolution, which demands the restoration of capitalism in Eastern European countries, is to make trouble for the U.S. at the summit meeting. He said that this resolution would "strengthen the (U.S.) president's position at the summit meeting."

It is revealed that the U.S. State Department had earlier indicated to the House Foreign Affairs Committee that "when discussing general East-West relations (at the summit meeting), there may be appropriate opportunities to consider issues such as Eastern Europe."

    美国力图破坏首脑会议
    竟要在会上讨论资本主义在东欧复辟问题
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：在东西方最高级会议行将举行的时候，美国众议院2日通过了一个毒化会议气氛的决议，竟然要艾森豪威尔在最高级会议上“设法恢复”东欧社会主义国家的所谓“基本自由”。
    决议的起草人、众议员扎布洛基在讲话中表明，众议院通过这个要求资本主义在东欧国家复辟的决议的目的，是要美国在最高级会议上无理取闹。他说什么这个决议将“加强（美国）总统在最高级会议上的地位”。
  据透露，美国国务院早些时候曾向众议院外交委员会表示，“在（最高级会议）讨论一般的东西方关系问题时，也许会出现考虑像东欧这样的问题的适当机会”。
