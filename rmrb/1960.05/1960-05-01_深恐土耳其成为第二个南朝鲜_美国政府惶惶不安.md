Xinhua News Agency, 30th Dispatch from Washington: Following the heroic struggle in South Korea against the U.S. puppet regime's fascist rule, the large-scale student demonstrations in Turkey against the Menderes dictatorial rule, at the other end of Asia, have once again plunged the U.S. government into panic and unease.

According to Washington officials, U.S. President Eisenhower has ordered government officials to "keep him informed of the developments in the Turkish political situation at all times." The news said that because the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France, as well as the Ministerial Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, will soon hold a meeting in Istanbul, Eisenhower expressed particular concern about the "possible development trends" in the Turkish situation.

U.S. State Department spokesman White tried to downplay the significance of the demonstrations against the Menderes government at a press conference yesterday, saying that the student demonstrations in Turkey and the recent events in South Korea "cannot be compared." However, American public opinion generally acknowledges that the demonstrations are of the same nature as the South Korean people's uprising against the U.S.-Syngman Rhee clique. Even U.S. government officials privately admitted that this was due to "growing domestic discontent finally erupting into violent actions and demonstrations" in Turkey.

An Associated Press dispatch from Washington yesterday hinted that the Menderes government should strengthen its suppression of student demonstrations. The news agency said that "any development in Turkey that could jeopardize its strength and stability would be viewed with serious concern here (Washington)." An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington yesterday also stated that if the upcoming North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting in Istanbul were held against the backdrop of large-scale demonstrations against the Menderes government, "considered by Washington as the United States' most steadfast ally," Washington would feel "very regretful."

Xinhua News Agency, 29th Dispatch: Agence France-Presse, 28th, Washington dispatch said, "The news of Turkish student demonstrations against the Menderes government has caused some unease in Washington." The dispatch said that U.S. officials "hope that the situation in Istanbul will not get worse." The dispatch also pointed out that "qualified people" in Washington have this idea: Turkish students "taking to the streets" are encouraged by the events in South Korea.

    深恐土耳其成为第二个南朝鲜
    美国政府惶惶不安
    新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：继南朝鲜爆发反抗美国傀儡政权的法西斯统治的英勇斗争之后，在亚洲的另一端——土耳其爆发的反对曼德列斯独裁统治的大规模学生示威，使美国政府再度陷入惶然不安中。
    据华盛顿的官方人士透露，美国总统艾森豪威尔已经命令政府官员“随时把土耳其政治局势的发展告诉他”。消息说，由于美、英、法三国外长以及北大西洋军事集团部长理事会即将在伊斯坦布尔举行会议，艾森豪威尔对土耳其局势的“可能发展趋势”表示特别关心。
    美国国务院发言人怀特昨天在记者招待会上力图贬低反对曼德列斯政府的示威的意义，说什么这次土耳其爆发的学生大示威和南朝鲜最近的事件“不能相比”。但是美国舆论普遍承认，这次示威同南朝鲜人民反对美李集团的大起义是属于同一性质的。甚至美国政府官员们在私下里也承认，这次是由于土耳其“国内日益增长的不满情绪最后爆发成暴力行动和示威”。
    合众国际社在昨天从华盛顿发出的一条消息中暗示要曼德列斯政府加强镇压学生的示威，这家通讯社说，在土耳其的“任何可能危及它的力量和稳定的发展，都会引起此间（华盛顿）的严重关切看待。”法新社昨天从华盛顿发出的一条消息也说，如果即将在伊斯坦布尔举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议是在反对“被华盛顿认为是美国最坚定的同盟者”的曼德列斯政府大示威的背景下举行的话，那将会使华盛顿感到“非常遗憾”。
    据新华社29日讯　法新社28日从华盛顿发出的一条电讯说，“土耳其学生示威反对曼德列斯政府的消息在华盛顿引起了某些不安”。电讯说，美国官方人士“希望伊斯坦布尔的局势不致变得更坏”。电讯还指出，华盛顿“有资格的人士”抱有这种想法：土耳其学生“上大街”是由于南朝鲜的事件鼓舞起来的。
