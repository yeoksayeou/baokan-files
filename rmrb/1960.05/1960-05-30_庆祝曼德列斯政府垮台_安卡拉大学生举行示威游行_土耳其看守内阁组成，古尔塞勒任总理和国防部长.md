Xinhua News Agency, May 29th: Ankara dispatch: Ankara University students held a demonstration yesterday to celebrate the downfall of the U.S.-backed Menderes regime.

They carried a huge portrait of Kemal, the founder of the Turkish Republic, and a coffin with the words "Dictatorship and Reaction" written on it.

Professors from the school marched with the students. The marching crowd sang a song they had composed themselves, entitled: "What happened to Menderes? He became an ex-dictator."

The song title was a satire of Menderes' earlier statement that he would never make himself an "ex-Prime Minister."

Xinhua News Agency, May 29th: According to an official Turkish communique released on the 28th, a caretaker cabinet consisting of nineteen ministers (including the Prime Minister and two Deputy Prime Ministers who are also Ministers of State) has been formed. Gursel, Chairman of the "National Unity Committee" which now rules Turkey, has taken on the key positions of Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.

Reuters reported from Washington on the 28th, citing U.S. State Department officials as saying that "the news from Turkey" was "reassuring" to the United States. Reuters also said that Washington authorities had indicated their conviction that the "vital interests" of "free nations" would not be "affected."

Reportedly, one of the reasons why U.S. State Department officials made this assessment of the Turkish military coup was that the new regime headed by Gursel had "emphasized its determination to remain steadfastly a member of NATO and the Central Treaty Organization."

Xinhua News Agency, May 29th: Ankara dispatch: General Gursel, who took over as Prime Minister of the caretaker cabinet after the military coup in Turkey, said at a press conference held on the 28th that the military launched the coup because it "believed that the situation had reached such a serious level that only force could save the country."

At the press conference, Gursel reiterated that his government would hand over power to an elected government. He said that a special committee of constitutional experts appointed by the "National Unity Committee" would complete the drafting of a new constitution within a month or a month and a half. He stated that there would be no referendum on the new constitution.

In answering questions, Gursel said that the number of Menderes regime members arrested across Turkey did not exceed two hundred. He said that sixty of the seventy provincial governors had expressed their willingness to "follow his command." He said he was confident that the army was supporting him.

Gursel announced at the meeting that he had been notified that the governments of the United States, Britain, Greece, and Italy were taking normal procedures to recognize his government.

According to Washington reports, the Turkish Ambassador to Washington has submitted a note to the U.S. State Department, formally assuring the United States that Turkey will continue to be "loyal" to its "various international treaties and alliances."

In answering a question, Gursel said that he could not visit the Soviet Union.

According to reports, the Turkish caretaker cabinet held its first meeting this morning, presided over by Prime Minister Gursel.

The Turkish military government today sent Menderes, former President Bayar, and other arrested former cabinet members to an island called Yassiada, located between the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea. Their properties were also frozen. The military government released military officers, students, and journalists who had been imprisoned by the Menderes government. Meanwhile, about 150 members of the Democratic Party's National Assembly belonging to Menderes, who had been taken into custody at the time of the military coup, were also released on the 29th. Turkish military authorities announced that the curfew would continue in major cities, prohibiting pedestrian traffic from 11:00 PM to 4:00 AM.

    庆祝曼德列斯政府垮台
    安卡拉大学生举行示威游行
    土耳其看守内阁组成，古尔塞勒任总理和国防部长
    新华社29日讯　安卡拉消息：安卡拉大学的学生昨天举行了一次示威游行，庆祝美国扶植的曼德列斯政权的垮台。
    他们抬着土耳其共和国的创始人凯末尔的巨幅像片，还抬着一口写着“独裁和反动”字样的棺材。
    这个学校的教授同学生们一起游行。游行的队伍唱着他们自己编的一首歌，歌名是：“曼德列斯发生了什么事？他变成了前独裁者”。
    这首歌的歌名是讽刺曼德列斯早些时候所说的他决不会使自己成为“前总理”的话的。
    据新华社29日讯　据土耳其官方28日发表的一项公报宣布，由十九名部长（包括总理和两名副总理兼国务部长）组成的看守内阁已经组成。现在统治着土耳其的“全国团结委员会”的主席古尔塞勒担任了总理、国防部长、武装部队总司令等要职。
    路透社28日自华盛顿援引美国国务院官员的话报道说，“土耳其的消息”，对美国说来“是使人安心的”。路透社还说，华盛顿当局表明他们确信，“自由国家”的“切身利益”将不会受到“影响”。
    据报道，美国国务院官员对土耳其军事政变作出这种估价的理由之一是，以古尔塞勒为首的新政权已经“强调这样的决心：它仍将坚定地是北大西洋公约组织和中央条约组织的成员国”。
    新华社29日讯　安卡拉消息：在土耳其军队发动政变后担任看守内阁总理的古尔塞勒将军在28日举行的记者招待会上说，军队发动政变是因为“相信这个局势已经达到如此严重程度，只有武力才能挽救这个国家。”
    古尔塞勒在招待会上又一次重申，他的政府将把政权移交给选举出来的政府。他说，由“全国团结委员会”所任命的宪法专家特别委员会将在一个月或一个半月的时间内完成新宪法制定的工作。他表示，将不就新宪法举行公民投票。
    古尔塞勒在答复问题时说，在土耳其全国被捕的曼德列斯政权成员人数不超过二百人。他说，在七十名省长中已有六十名表示“听从他的指挥”。他说，他确信陆军是支持他的。
    古尔塞勒在会上宣布，他已接到通知说美国、英国、希腊和意大利政府正在采取承认他的政府的正常程序。
    据华盛顿消息，土耳其驻华盛顿大使已经向美国国务院递交了一项照会，正式向美国保证土耳其将继续“忠于”它的“各种国际条约和联盟”。
    古尔塞勒回答问题时说，他不能去苏联访问。
    据报道，土耳其看守内阁今天早晨在总理古尔塞勒的主持下举行了第一次会议。
    土耳其军政府今天把曼德列斯、前总统拜亚尔、和其他被逮捕的前阁员送往黑海和爱琴海之间的一个名为雅西亚达的岛上。他们的财产也被冻结。军政府释放了被曼德列斯政府监禁的军官、学生和记者。同时，在军队发动政变时被看管的一百五十名左右属于曼德列斯的民主党国民议会议员在29日也被释放。土耳其军事当局宣布，宵禁在大城市将继续下去，从晚上二十三点起到清晨四点禁止行人通行。
