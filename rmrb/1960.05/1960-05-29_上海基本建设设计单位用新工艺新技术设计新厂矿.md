Shanghai Basic Construction Design Units Use New Technology and New Processes to Design New Factories and Mines
A batch of advanced designs have been completed: "One piece of equipment is equivalent to one workshop, one workshop is equivalent to one factory, and one factory is equivalent to several factories."

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Electric Report – The design units of the Shanghai basic construction system, centered on the "Six News" in design technology and the "Six Transformations" in design methods, have launched a great technological revolution. They are rapidly and promptly applying the new technologies, new structures, new equipment, new styles, new materials, and new theories emerging from the technological revolution movement in Shanghai and other places to the construction of new factories and mines, striving to design a batch of new factories and mines that are technologically the most advanced, economically the most reasonable, and most capable of unleashing production potential. The designs of some factories and mines have become typical examples of the comprehensive application of the latest technologies. By the end of April, these design units had completed 85% of their annual workload; among them, six design units had completed their annual workload plans ahead of schedule.

The technological revolution movement centered on "Six News" (new technology, new structure, new equipment, new style, new materials, new theories) and "Six Transformations" (design standardization, data serialization, drawing assembly, calculation tabulation and electrification, tool mechanization and semi-mechanization, labor organization rationalization) in the design departments has rapidly changed the construction and future production outlook of many factories and mines. When designing a coal mine, the Shanghai Coal Mine Design Institute collected and applied the innovative processes and new technologies of other coal mine shafts and mining machinery manufacturing plants, which enabled the mine to save 50% of its investment, and the overall efficiency can reach twelve tons. The automatic flow production line for processing diesel engine water tanks and boiler tubes has not been available for a long time; the Second Design Institute of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry recently concentrated a batch of factory machine tool automatic production data, and designed an automatic flow production line for manufacturing products such as water tanks and boiler tubes, greatly saving construction costs and improving production efficiency.

In the "Six News" and "Six Transformations" technological innovation, the designers of each design unit spent a lot of effort to carry out technical integration and improvement work on many technological innovation and technical revolution projects from the production front. Because the new technologies and new processes emerging from the technological revolution were absorbed during the design, and after mass discussions, the completion of many major design projects was equivalent to carrying out a comprehensive improvement of a whole set of technological revolutions. From January to April of this year, each unit designed a batch of advanced designs in which one piece of equipment is equivalent to one workshop, one workshop is equivalent to one factory, and one factory is equivalent to several factories.

    以设计技术上的“六新”、设计方法上的“六化”为中心大搞设计革命
    上海基本建设设计单位用新工艺新技术设计新厂矿
    已完成一批“一个设备抵一个车间、一个车间抵一个工厂、一个工厂抵几个工厂”的先进设计
    据新华社上海电　上海基本建设系统的设计单位以设计技术上的“六新”、设计方法上的“六化”为中心，展开了技术大革命。他们把上海和各地技术革命运动中涌现出来的新工艺、新结构、新设备、新风格、新材料和新理论，迅速及时地运用到新的工厂、矿山的建设中去，力争设计出一批技术上最先进，经济上最合理、最能发挥生产潜力的新厂矿。有些厂矿的设计已成为综合运用最新技术的典型。到4月底止，这批设计单位已完成全年工作量的85％；其中，有六个设计单位已提前完成了全年工作量计划。
    设计部门以“六新”（新工艺、新结构、新设备、新风格、新材料、新理论）、“六化”（设计标准化、资料系列化、制图装配化、计算图表化电气化、工具机械化半机械化、劳动组织合理化）为中心的技术革命运动，迅速地改变了许多厂矿的建设和将来生产的面貌。上海煤矿设计院在设计一座煤矿时，收集和应用了其他煤矿矿井和矿山机械制造厂的革新工艺和新技术，使这个矿井的投资可以节约50％，全员效率可以达到十二吨。柴油机水箱、锅炉管子加工，一直没有自动流水生产线；第一机械工业部第二设计院，最近集中了一批工厂机床自动生产的资料，设计出制造水箱、锅炉管子等产品的自动流水生产线，大大节省了建设费用，提高了生产效率。
    在“六新”、“六化”的技术革新中，各设计单位的设计人员花了很大力量，对许多来自生产战线的技术革新和技术革命项目，进行了技术上的综合、提高工作。由于设计时吸收了技术革命中出现的新工艺、新技术，并经过群众鸣放讨论，许多重大设计项目的完成，等于把一整套的技术革命进行了一次综合和提高。今年1到4月，各单位都设计出一批一个设备抵一个车间、一个车间抵一个厂、一个厂抵几个厂的先进的设计。
