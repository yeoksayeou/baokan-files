Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Trường Chinh, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, spoke at a mass rally in Hanoi. He pointed out that the US imperialists' sabotage of the summit meeting was another new crime committed against world peace. The US imperialists must bear full responsibility before the people of the world.

Trường Chinh said that the Vietnamese people are extremely angry at the US imperialists' blatant acts of aggression and extremely stubborn attitude. The Vietnamese people fully support the Soviet Union's resolute attitude in exposing the US imperialists' sabotage of the summit meeting.

Trường Chinh pointed out that the US imperialists' madly provocative act of sabotaging the summit meeting has made the peace-loving people of the world see more clearly the ferocious, cunning, and hypocritical true face of US imperialism and hate them even more.

Trường Chinh said that peace cannot be begged for. Peace can only be achieved by waging a resolute struggle against the war-mongering groups and aggressive blocs. The essence of imperialism is war and aggression. Only through intense struggle can peace be consolidated.

Trường Chinh said that through close unity and resolute struggle, the people of the world will certainly defeat all the dark conspiracies of imperialism, thereby winning lasting peace. The future belongs to us. The era of imperialism calling the wind and summoning the rain is gone forever.

Trường Chinh strongly condemned US imperialism for stepping up the revival of West German and Japanese militarism, continuing to occupy Taiwan, and interfering in South Korea, South Vietnam, and Laos.

Trường Chinh pointed out that the current situation in Laos was created by US imperialism. He said that we firmly stand with the Lao people and all people of conscience in Laos to demand that US imperialism get out of Laos, let the Lao people decide their own destiny, and let Laos freely follow the path of peace and neutrality that the Lao people desire.

Referring to the situation in South Vietnam, Trường Chinh stated that it is impossible to agree with the International Commission's majority vote conclusion that the US-Ngo Dinh Diem group's increase in US "military aid advisory group" military personnel and the promulgation of Ordinance No. 10 of 1959 did not violate the Geneva Accords.

Trường Chinh said that we demand that the International Commission adopt a correct attitude to complete the task of supervising and monitoring the strict implementation of the provisions of the Geneva Accords and safeguarding peace in Indochina.

    长征在河内群众大会上讲话
    坚决斗争才能取得和平
    据新华社讯　越南劳动党中央政治局委员长征在河内群众大会上讲了话。他指出，美帝国主义破坏最高级会议，是对世界和平犯下的又一新的罪行。美帝国主义必须在全世界人民面前担负完全的责任。
    长征说，越南人民对美帝国主义明目张胆的侵略行动和极其顽固的态度感到无比愤怒。越南人民完全支持苏联揭露美帝国主义破坏最高级会议面目的坚决态度。
    长征指出，美帝国主义破坏最高级会议的疯狂挑衅行动，使全世界爱好和平人民更清楚地看到美帝国主义的凶残、诡诈、假仁假义的真面目，并且更加仇恨他们。
    长征说，和平是不能乞求的，只有对好战集团、侵略集团展开坚决的斗争，才能取得和平。帝国主义的本质是好战和侵略，只有进行强烈的斗争，和平才能得到巩固。
    长征说，紧密团结和坚决斗争，世界人民将一定击退帝国主义的一切黑暗阴谋，从而赢得持久和平。未来是属于我们的。帝国主义呼风唤雨的时代一去不复返了。
    长征强烈谴责了美帝国主义加紧复活西德和日本军国主义，继续占领台湾以及在南朝鲜、南越、老挝的干涉行为。
    长征指出老挝目前的局势，是美帝国主义造成的。他说，我们坚决同老挝人民，同老挝所有有良知的人们一起，要美帝国主义滚出老挝，让老挝人民自己来决定自己的命运，让老挝自由地走老挝人民所期望的和平中立的道路。
    谈到南越局势时，长征表示决不能够同意国际委员会多数票作出的关于美国—吴庭艳集团增加美国“军事援助顾问团”军事人员和颁布1959年第十号法令不违反日内瓦协议的结论。
    长征说，我们要求国际委员会采取正确的态度来完成监督和监察严正履行日内瓦协议各项条款、保卫印度支那和平的任务。
