    Nanjing's Wulaocun Health Work Reaches New Heights
    Extensive Promotion of Health Knowledge is Known to Every Household
    (Our dispatch) Nanjing Wulaocun, a national model health unit, using the amateur hygiene school as its center, universally carries out the promotion and education of scientific health knowledge, and on the basis of greening, beautifying, and perfuming, its health work is advancing towards science.
    The Wulaocun Residents' Committee began holding various scientific health lectures in 1953. In 1959, it established an amateur hygiene school, widely organizing cadres and residents of the whole village to study in turn. The course content includes general scientific health knowledge such as public health, physiology and anatomy, an overview of infectious diseases, bacteriology, disinfection, nutrition, first aid, laboratory testing, maternal and child health, and public canteen food management. Through classroom lectures, the masses learned the causes of many common diseases and understood many common-sense hygienic preventive measures. In recent years, Wulaocun has held five batches of scientific health knowledge lectures lasting three months each, with more than 350 people having undergone specialized study. The amateur hygiene school also promotes scientific health knowledge to the general public three times a day through broadcasting. Through the study and promotion of the hygiene school, the level of scientific health knowledge of Wulaocun residents has been greatly improved. Now, every household in Wulaocun disinfects their tableware every day. During the measles epidemic season last year, every household in Wulaocun bought lactic acid to disinfect the air in their houses, strictly controlling the occurrence of measles. Wulaocun residents now universally believe in scientific testing. No matter which resident sees a child with a slightly yellow face, they will send the child to the hospital to test their stool. They have also taken action to establish a strict epidemic reporting network. When infectious diseases are discovered in the Nanjing area, the people of Wulaocun quickly find out. This year, more than 1,600 residents of Wulaocun have also universally established health cards and undergo regular physical examinations. By early April, more than 1,500 people in the village had undergone physical examinations and fluoroscopies. Now, Wulaocun has eliminated ten diseases (malaria, trachoma, schistosomiasis, filariasis, ascariasis, hookworm, tinea capitis, syphilis, leprosy, and trichomoniasis).
    The Residents' Committee mobilizes the masses to beautify the environment, residents are harmonious and united, and rationally arrange their lives to achieve a balance between work and rest.

    本报讯　全国甲等卫生模范单位南京五老村，以业余卫生学校为中心，普遍进行科学卫生知识的宣传和教育，在绿化、美化、香化的基础上，卫生工作向科学化进军。
    五老村居民委员会从1953年开始便举办起了各种科学卫生讲座，1959年办起了业余卫生学校，广泛地组织全村的干部、居民轮流学习。课程内容包括公共卫生、生理解剖、传染病概况、细菌学、消毒学、营养学、急救、化验、妇幼卫生、公共食堂饮食管理等一般科学卫生常识。通过课堂讲授，群众知道了许多常见疾病发生的原因，并懂得了许多卫生预防常识。几年来，五老村共办了五批为期三个月的科学卫生知识讲座，有三百五十多人经过了专门的学习。业余卫生学校还通过广播一天三次向广大群众宣传科学卫生知识。通过卫生学校的学习和宣传，大大的提高了五老村居民的科学卫生知识水平。现在五老村居民家家户户的食具天天消毒。去年痳疹流行季节，五老村家家户户买了乳酸在屋子里进行空气消毒，严格的控制了痲疹的发生。五老村居民现在普遍相信科学化验。不论那个居民看到孩子有点脸黄就会送孩子到医院化验大便。他们还人人动手建立了一个严密的疫情报告网。南京地区发现那里有传染病，五老村人很快就会知道。今年来五老村一千六百多居民还普遍建立了健康卡，定期进行体格检查。到4月初全村已有一千五百多人进行了体格检查和透视。现在五老村已消灭了十病（疟疾、砂眼、血吸虫、血丝虫、蛔虫、钩虫、头癣、梅毒、痳疯和滴虫）。
    居民委员会发动群众美化环境，居民间和睦团结，合理安排生活达到有劳有逸。
