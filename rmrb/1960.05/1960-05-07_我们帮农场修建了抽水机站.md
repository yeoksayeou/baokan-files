At the support agriculture collaboration zone leadership小组会议上, Huang Zhigang, the general branch secretary of the Neijiang Special Zone Farm, enthusiastically introduced their farm's planning situation for this year. He said: This year, we plan to build five pumping stations in Wanlipo, Gaoba, and Lexianpu, planning to pump 15,000 to 18,000 tons of water per day. This way, the farm's more than 4,000 mu of land and orchards can achieve mechanized irrigation and drainage. The comrades from various factories who attended the meeting were overjoyed and eagerly asked Comrade Huang Zhigang: "What are you lacking?" "Which pumping station should be built first?" It was discussed at the meeting that our power plant, the motor factory, and the hardware machinery factory would complete the construction of the five pumping stations in a concentrated effort by the end of March, and in the second quarter, we would help the farm install 5,000 meters of light rail, process 50 flatcars, and 4 wheat threshers...

With light clouds and a clear sky, our group of seven began the site surveying work for the pumping stations. We set off from the farm, passed through the Xiejiaba Garden, and stepped onto the Gaoba Plain along a rural road. The plain was filled with endless wheat fields in bloom and countless rapeseed fields with flowers in full bloom, with a refreshing fragrance. After crossing a few small hills, we climbed Wanlipo. Comrade Li Zhiming from the farm pointed to the turbulent river water below the mountain and said excitedly to me: "The Tuo River is truly well-formed! It circles the farm's land once. But without mechanized irrigation and drainage, the wheat yield on the mountain last year did not reach the predetermined target." As he pointed to a wheat field in front of him, he sighed and said, "Its seedlings are not as good as those on the plain, and the leaves at the roots are yellow." Comrade Huang Zhigang interjected: "We want to build a pumping station here, to have the Tuo River water cross the mountains, dig channels and divert it using the mountain shape, to irrigate the third cultivation area." I thought to myself: But the terrain here is steep, the project is huge, and more importantly, can the small pump draw water? We held a meeting on the spot, and everyone discussed it enthusiastically. Finally, it was unanimously agreed to move this pump to the Gaoba pumping station. This will save labor and cast iron pipes, and also advance the time by half. These projects were truly urgent for supporting the drought resistance at that time. From morning to night, everyone worked busily for a day and finally determined the locations of the four pumping stations.

A few days later, a telegram came from the farm headquarters: Installation is currently underway. I decided to go to the construction site. The night was quiet and deep, the earth was filled with fog, and the cold wind brushed my face, making me feel a little trembling. I walked along a narrow field path and slowly came to the construction site. It was already midnight, but the construction site was still brightly lit, with a hubbub of voices. Under the light of two gas lamps, workers and farm employees were digging ditches, installing water pipes, inspecting machines, and repairing parts, working hard in one go. The shouts, calls, and the sound of hammers striking intertwined, and a tense battle scene was displayed before people's eyes.

On the way back to the factory, I kept thinking about the workers' spirit of supporting agriculture, striving for time, not making conditions, not counting time, and working selflessly. This is precisely the portrayal of the entire factory's employees, one heart, one mind, and one appearance.

During the days of supporting agriculture, all the employees of the factory, especially the workers in the support team, under the leadership of the Party, mustered soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, closely cooperated with the farm, the motor factory, and the hardware factory employees, and completed the construction of five pumping stations one after another in just two months, and immediately put them into pumping water, with a total pumping volume of more than 10,000 tons per day, enabling the farm's nearly 4,000 mu of land to basically achieve water conservancy with mechanized irrigation and drainage as the main feature. Therefore, in this spring drought resistance struggle, all the wheat, rapeseed, and orchards in the field were irrigated two or three times. And eliminated the dragon bone water lifter and manual water lifting, effectively ensuring this year's agricultural harvest.

    我们帮农场修建了抽水机站
    中共四川内江发电厂委员会书记　王良波
    在支援农业协作区领导小组的会议上，内江专区农场总支书记黄智刚同志，津津有味地介绍了他们农场今年的规划情况。他说：今年要在万里坡、高坝、乐贤铺这些地方建设五个抽水机站，每天打算抽水一万五千吨到一万八千吨。这样一来，农场的四千多亩土地、果园就可以实现机械排灌了。到会各厂同志听得眉飞色舞，争先恐后的问黄智刚同志：“你们缺些什么？”“先建那个抽水机站”。会议上商量好，我们电厂和电机厂、五金机械厂在3月底突击完成五个抽水机站的建设工程，第二季度帮助农场安装轻便轨道五千米，加工平车五十部，小麦脱粒机四台……。
    云淡风清，碧空万里。我们一行七人，开始了抽水机站站址的勘测工作。我们从农场出发穿过谢家坝园林，沿着一条乡村公路步入上高坝平原。坝上一望无际的是正在扬花的小麦，和难以数计花开满枝的油菜田，清香扑鼻。翻过几个小山丘，我们爬上了万里坡。农场李志明同志指着山下湍流的江水兴奋地对我说：“沱江生得真好！它围绕农场土地盘旋一周。可是没有机械排灌，去年山上小麦产量都没有达到预定的指标。”随着他指着面前的一块小麦地感叹地说：“它的苗稼就不如坝上的好，根部叶子发黄”。黄智刚同志插嘴说：“我们想在这里建一个抽水机站，要沱江水翻山越岭，利用山形挖沟引出，灌溉第三耕作区”。我心里暗想：可是这里地形陡了，工程浩大，更重要的是抽水机小了能否抽得上水。我们就地开了个会，大家热烈讨论起来。最后一致认为把这台抽水机迁移在高坝抽水机站。这样就能节约劳动力和铸铁管，还能把时间提前一半。这些工程对支援当时抗旱来说，真是迫不及待。从早到晚大家忙碌一天，终于把四个抽水机站地点定下来了。
    几天以后，从农场指挥部来电知道：目前正在紧张的安装。决定去工地一趟。夜静更深，大地弥漫着雾障，寒风拂面，感到有些颤抖。我沿着一条狭窄的田坎路，漫步来到工地。已经午夜了，工地上还灯火通明，人声鼎沸，工人和农场职工在两盏煤汽灯光下，正在挖水沟，安装水管，检查机器，修理配件，一鼓作气，干得很欢。?喝声、号子声、鎯头的撞击声交织一起，一片紧张的战斗场面展现在人们面前。
    在回厂的路上，我反复地在想着工人们为了争取时间，不讲条件，不计时间，忘我的支援农业的精神，正是当前全厂职工一条心、一股劲、一个样的写照。
    在支援农业的日子里，全厂职工，特别是支援队工人，在党的领导下，鼓足了冲天的革命干劲，密切和农场、电机厂、五金厂职工协作，仅仅用两个月时间，就先后完成了五个抽水机站的建设，并立即建成抽水，每天总抽水量达一万吨以上，使农场近四千亩土地，基本实现了以机械排灌为主的水利化。因此，在这次小春抗旱斗争中，全场小麦、油菜、果园都浇灌了两三遍。并消灭了龙骨车和人力提水，有力地保证了今年农业丰收。
