    Sunflowers bloom redly,
    Each flower is a happy child,
    Boundless joy and a bright future,
    Everywhere is the east wind across the vast land.
    Sunflowers bloom redly,
    Bathed in the east wind from childhood,
    Loving learning, science, and labor,
    Following the revolutionary fathers and brothers step by step.
    Children of the Mao Zedong era,
    Setting lofty aspirations and full of ambition,
    Today adding a brick and a tile to the motherland's construction,
    Tomorrow to ride the communist rocket and travel the sky!
    Jiang Tiefeng, woodcut
    Jiang Cheng, verse (with picture)
    Lots of good books in kindergarten
    Loving cleanliness and hygiene
    Little friends pollinating pumpkins

    向阳花开朵朵红向阳花开朵朵红，朵朵花儿是幸福儿童，欢乐无边前途似锦，山河万里处处是东风。向阳花开朵朵红，从小沐浴着东风，爱学习爱科学又爱劳动，步步跟随着革命的父兄。毛泽东时代的孩子，立下雄图大志满心胸，今天为祖国建设添上一砖一瓦，明天要驾共产主义火箭遨游长空！
