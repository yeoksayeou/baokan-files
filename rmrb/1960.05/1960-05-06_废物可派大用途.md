The employees of the Chongqing Silk Textile Factory have turned waste silk gum and silkworm pupae residue, which were not fully utilized, into more than ten products, including serine, amino acid, silkworm pupa protein, monosodium glutamate soy sauce, leather polishing paste, soap, and organic fertilizer. These treasures transformed from waste have great uses in medicine, industry, and agriculture. Leather polishing paste is a leather-making agent, which was previously made from casein produced from milk. Now it is made from silkworm pupae residue with good quality.

    废物可派大用途
    重庆丝纺厂职工，把没有充分利用的废丝胶、蛹屑等废物制成丝氨酸、酸氨酸、蚕蛹蛋白、味精酱油、皮革揩光浆、肥皂、有机化肥等十多种产品。这些废物变成的宝物，在医药上、工业、农业上，都有很大用途。皮革揩光浆是制革用剂，过去是用牛奶制成酪素后制成的，现在用蛹屑制造质量良好。
