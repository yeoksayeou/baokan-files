The Japanese People's Struggle Against the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance
By Chizu Masukazu, Head of the Japanese-Chinese Friendship Association Delegation to China

Today, the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government is attempting to forcibly approve the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the Diet.

This demonstrates the blatant aggressive intentions of U.S. imperialism: to permanently place Japan under a state of semi-occupation by the United States; to turn Japan into a base for the United States to launch aggressive wars against Asia; and to make Japan economically subordinate to the United States under the control of U.S. monopoly capital. As a loyal spokesperson for Japanese monopoly capital, which dreams of reviving imperialism, the Kishi Nobusuke government is doing its utmost to revive Japanese militarism, actively selling out the country, and willingly colluding with U.S. imperialism to form a U.S.-Japan military alliance.

U.S. imperialism is gathering groups like the dictators Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, whom the people hate like poisonous snakes, attempting to use Asians to fight Asians. It is clear that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' signing of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is to realize this attempt by U.S. imperialism, and it is a blatant conspiracy by U.S. imperialism to cobble together a Northeast Asian military alliance.

The U.S. Seventh Fleet, equipped with nuclear weapons, uses Yokosuka, Japan, as its base. It can not only freely move to the waters of the Taiwan Strait, but the guns of the U.S. military missile base in Okinawa are pointed at mainland China. Moreover, U.S. planes frequently patrol the skies over the Sea of Japan, constantly seeking opportunities to invade mainland China, which is a well-known fact.

The manifestation of this dangerous policy of aggression and war by U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke government within Japan is that monopoly capital is increasingly intensifying its exploitation of workers, peasants, small and medium-sized business owners, and the people of the whole country, depriving the people of their democratic rights and freedoms, and worsening the people's lives.

However, faced with the enemy's vicious conspiracy, the Japanese people's awareness is increasing, and the class struggle is intensifying day by day. With the full support of the bourgeoisie, Mitsui monopoly capitalists launched a fascist offensive to destroy the Miike Mine Workers' Union, a bastion of the Japan Coal Mine Workers' Union. The Miike coal miners, as the most important link in the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," are fighting against the offensive of monopoly capital with the support of the people of the whole country. This is a typical example of the intensification of class struggle.

In the past year, the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" has been developing day by day. In particular, Kishi Nobusuke's departure to the United States on January 16 this year to sign the new "Security Treaty," completely disregarding the strong opposition of the Japanese people, exposed the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Kishi Nobusuke more clearly to the people than ever before. Even some people who were previously misled by the words "autonomy" and "equality" felt uneasy. As a result, the indignation of the people of the whole country has increased.

Thus, when the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party plotted the fascist conspiracy to forcibly pass the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives in late April, the flames of popular anger finally erupted. On April 26, the day of the 15th unified action, seven million people launched an unprecedented massive protest struggle across the country. This struggle of the Japanese people started with the victory of the struggle against the "Police Duties Law" the year before and has been surging upward. The struggle against U.S. military bases, represented by the Sunagawa people's struggle, the large-scale march to demand the return of Okinawa to Japan, the struggle to rescue the innocent defendants of the so-called "Matsukawa Incident" which no one in the world believes, the struggle of the Miike coal miners, the struggle to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, the struggle of women and youth, and various movements such as the struggle to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, have converged into a great struggle for independence and peace related to the fate of the Japanese nation. The huge energy accumulated by the people, along with the unified action centered on the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the trade unions, is becoming an increasingly powerful force.

However, Kishi Nobusuke, who once stained his hands with blood during the invasion of China, not only does not reflect on his responsibility for the war of aggression, but shamelessly opposes China, helps U.S. imperialism plot the "two Chinas" conspiracy, and obstructs the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. Kishi Nobusuke's attitude, who wants to follow the old path of Tanaka Giichi and Tojo Hideki, is becoming more and more isolated among the people.

Under the martial law of the Syngman Rhee army, directly commanded by the U.S. military under the name of "United Nations forces," the people of South Korea can hardly maintain even the most basic human living standards. They finally rose up to resist the rule of medieval oppression and massacre that caused anger and drove the most insane lackey of U.S. imperialism, Syngman Rhee, out of office. They clearly realize that the root cause of the current disaster in South Korea is U.S. imperialism.

Needless to say, this heroic patriotic struggle and valuable lessons of the South Korean people have given the Japanese people's struggle tremendous encouragement and courage. Recently, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (“Sohyo”), the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea issued a joint statement expressing support for the struggles of the Japanese and South Korean people and the determination to drive U.S. imperialism out of the Western Pacific. This not only proves that the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous government is by no means isolated, but also means that the people of Japan, China, and Korea will fight as comrades against a common enemy.

Currently, not only are the people of South Korea and Japan struggling, but the struggles of the people of Turkey, Africa, and Latin America against colonialists and foreign imperialism, and for national independence and liberation, are also burning like prairie fire. The current situation in Asia and Africa shows that the national independence movement and the anti-imperialist struggle are facing a new historical turning point.

There are still some difficulties ahead in our struggle. However, under the international situation in which the East wind prevails over the West wind, we are convinced that the victory of the anti-imperialist struggle for national independence and for peace in Asia will surely belong to the people.

We have witnessed the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese people in socialist construction and truly feel that China is a strong fortress of peace that no one can defeat. At the same time, I also deeply feel that the Chinese people hold exciting brotherly friendship for the Japanese people.

We give high praise to the historical significance of the increasingly strengthened comradely unity of the people of Japan, China, and Korea, and look forward with confidence to the 16th unified action to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" which will be launched from May 9th. We will wage a resolute struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance. We will also further develop the struggle for Japan's complete independence, peace, neutrality, and democracy.

    日本人民反对日美军事同盟的斗争
    日本中国友好协会访华代表团团长　赤津益造
    今天，日本岸信介政府正企图在国会强行批准新的日美“安全条约”。
    这表明了美帝国主义的露骨的侵略意图：把日本永久置于美国的半占领状态下；把日本变成美国对亚洲发动侵略战争的基地；使日本在美国垄断资本的控制下在经济上从属于美国。作为梦想复活帝国主义的日本垄断资本的忠实代言人，岸信介政府极力复活日本军国主义，积极地出卖祖国，心甘情愿同美帝国主义狼狈为奸，结成日美军事同盟。
    美帝国主义搜罗被人民恨之如蛇蝎的独裁者李承晚、蒋介石等集团，企图用亚洲人来打亚洲人。由此可见，美日反动派签订新的日美“安全条约”，就是要实现美帝国主义的这一企图，而且是美帝国主义拼凑东北亚军事同盟的露骨阴谋。
    装备着核武器的美国第七舰队，以日本的横须贺为根据地，它不仅可以自由地向台湾海峡的水域出动，而且冲绳的美军导弹基地的炮口是对着中国大陆的。这还不算，美国飞机经常在日本海面的上空巡逻，一刻不停地寻找侵略中国大陆的机会，这已是举世周知的事实了。
    美帝国主义和岸信介政府的这种危险的侵略和战争政策在日本国内的表现，就是垄断资本日益加紧剥削工人、农民、中小企业者和全国人民，剥夺人民的民主权利和自由，恶化人民的生活。
    但是，面对着敌人的这样凶恶的阴谋，日本人民的觉悟日益提高，阶级斗争一天天地激化起来。三井垄断资本家在资产阶级的全力声援下，向日本煤矿工会的堡垒三池煤矿工会进行了破坏工会的法西斯攻势。作为阻止批准新“安全条约”斗争最重要一环的三池煤矿工人，在全国人民的支援下，为反对垄断资本的进攻而进行斗争。这正是阶级斗争激化的典型事例。
    近一年来，阻止批准新“安全条约”的斗争，逐日地向前发展着。特别是岸信介完全不顾日本人民强烈的反对，在今年1月16日动身到美国去签署新“安全条约”，比过去任何时候都更清楚地在人民面前暴露了美帝国主义和岸信介的阴谋。连过去被“自主性”和“平等”的词句所迷惑的一部分人，也感到不安了。结果是全国人民的愤慨有增无已。
    就这样，当岸信介政府和自由民主党在4月下旬策划在国会众议院强行通过新“安全条约”的法西斯阴谋时，人民的愤怒火焰终于爆发了。在4月26日第十五次统一行动日这一天，七百万人民在全国各地展开了日本历史上空前的巨大的抗议斗争。日本人民的这一斗争，是以前年反对“警职法”斗争的胜利为起点而高涨起来的。以砂川人民斗争为代表的反对美国军事基地的斗争、争取冲绳归还日本的大游行、为援救世界上没有任何人相信的所谓“松川事件”无辜被告的斗争、三池煤矿工人的斗争、禁止原子弹氢弹的斗争、妇女和青年的斗争，以及争取恢复日中邦交等各种运动，汇合成一个同日本民族命运攸关的争取独立、和平的巨大斗争。人民所积聚起来的这样巨大的精力，随着以社会党、共产党、工会为中心的统一行动愈益增强，越益成为强大的力量。
    但是，曾经在侵略中国时双手沾满鲜血的岸信介，不仅丝毫不反省对侵略战争所负的责任，反而恬不知耻地敌视中国，帮助美帝国主义策划“两个中国”的阴谋和阻挠日中关系的正常化。想走田中义一、东条英机老路的岸信介的态度，在人民中间越来越孤立了。
    在名为“联合国军队”的美军直接指挥的李承晚军队的戒严令下，南朝鲜人民连最起码的人类生活水平都难以维持下去。他们终于起来反抗引起愤怒的中世纪式的压迫和屠杀的统治，把美帝国主义的最疯狂的走狗李承晚赶下台。他们很清楚地认识到现今南朝鲜的灾难的根源，就是美帝国主义。
    不消说，南朝鲜人民的这种英勇的爱国斗争和宝贵的教训，给了日本人民的斗争以巨大的鼓舞和勇气。最近，日本“总评”、中国“全总”和朝鲜“职总”发表了联合声明，表示了支持日本和南朝鲜人民的斗争和把美帝国主义赶出西太平洋的决心。这不仅证明日本人民反对美帝国主义和岸信介卖国政府的斗争决不是孤立的，还意味着日、中、朝三国人民要作为战友为反对共同的敌人而斗争。
    目前，不仅南朝鲜和日本的人民在进行斗争，土耳其、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对殖民主义者和外国帝国主义、争取民族独立和解放的斗争，也像燎原烈火般地燃烧起来。今天的亚非形势，显示出民族独立运动和反帝国主义斗争面临着一个新的历史转折点。
    我们的斗争前途，还有一些困难。但是，在东风压倒西风的国际形势下，我们确信无疑的是，为争取民族独立，为争取亚洲和平而进行的反帝国主义斗争的胜利，一定会属于人民。
    我们目睹中国人民在社会主义建设中取得的辉煌胜利，真实地感觉到中国是一个任何人也打不败的强大和平堡垒。同时我也深深地感到中国人民对日本人民持有激动人心的兄弟友谊。
    我们对于日、中、朝三国人民的战友般团结日益加强的历史意义给予崇高的评价，并且满怀信心地看待从5月9日起开展阻止批准新“安全条约”第十六次统一行动。我们将为粉碎日美军事同盟而进行坚决的斗争。我们还将进一步向前发展争取日本完全独立、和平、中立和民主的斗争。　　　（本报特约稿）
