Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 30th - The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Medium Plate Factory completed its April national steel plate production plan two days and sixteen hours ahead of schedule. The first-grade product rate of steel plates increased by 2.4% compared to the plan. Costs and labor productivity also met the plan, and safe production was achieved.
Since the beginning of this year, the No. 1 Medium Plate Factory has exceeded the national plan every month, and its production level has greatly improved compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This is the result of vigorously promoting technical innovation and technical revolution.
Now, the factory's employees have completed their production preparations for May, determined to surpass April's achievements in May and achieve a "full red" May.
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 30th - The employees of the electric furnace workshop of Daye Steel Plant used the outstanding achievement of completing the April production plan ahead of schedule to welcome Red May. As of April 29th, steel production exceeded the national plan by 0.3%, and the average daily output increased by 11.1% compared to the previous month, with good quality.
This workshop achieved a "full red" production in the first quarter. After entering April, the morale of cadres and employees became even higher. They put forward the slogan "Fight hard in April to realize the Four Modernizations, and ensure full red to welcome May Day," closely focusing on shortening smelting time, a key production factor, and successively organized two key breakthrough battles, thus greatly shortening the smelting time.
According to Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 30th - The coal miners of Fushun, the coal capital, are welcoming the "May Day" International Labor Day with the excellent achievement of completing the April plan two days ahead of schedule with an overproduction of more than 16,100 tons of coal.
Entering April, the Fushun coal miners launched a vigorous production competition to welcome "May Day". Focusing on the revolution of mining methods, they widely carried out technical innovation activities such as liberating heavy manual labor, simplifying production processes, and reducing the consumption of pit props. 53% of the coal mining faces in the mines under the Mining Bureau adopted the unmanned mining method for extra-thick coal seams, and the coal output and recovery efficiency were both doubled compared to the past. For heavy labor and weak links that use a lot of labor, the method of concentrating superior forces to fight an annihilation war was adopted, so that the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the entire bureau was rapidly improved.
Currently, a larger-scale production competition upsurge is taking shape.
According to Xinhua News Agency, 30th - After completing the April coal production plan three days ahead of schedule with an overproduction of 5,000 tons, the employees of the Jingxi Mining Bureau are striving to increase production by more than 70,000 tons of coal as a gift to the "May Day" festival.
Entering April, the broad masses of employees further engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution, putting forward more than 10,000 innovation proposals in less than a month, and more than 3,500 of them have been realized. By April 25th, fifteen "three-no" (no people, no pit props, no chutes) and "two-no" working faces had appeared in the bureau, and labor productivity had increased significantly. Due to the mechanization of heavy operations and the reorganization of labor organization, the bureau saved 989 people in April, of whom 562 supported the new mines.
All employees are making various preparations for celebrating the festival. Slogans and arches have been erected high, amateur cultural troupes from various units are rehearsing wonderful programs, and sports teams are also stepping up their training. The employees are happily preparing to participate in the "May Day" rally and parade and various celebration activities.
Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 30th - The employees of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant presented a gift to "May Day" with outstanding production achievements. As of April 29th, the entire plant had overfulfilled the April production plan, with the total output value exceeding by 9% and the commodity output value exceeding by 1.7%; Dongfanghong tractors exceeded by 100 units, and irrigation and drainage machinery had completed 86% of the annual plan.
In April, the factory's employees adopted self-reliance to produce more than 300 tons of various types of steel, and realized more than 19,000 technical innovations, with 37 automatic production lines and 330 automatic and semi-automatic machine tools, thereby ensuring the overfulfillment of the monthly plan.
Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 30th - Jilin Chemical Industrial Company completed its April production plan on the 28th. The total output value plan was completed by 101.6%, and the output plans of various major products were also overfulfilled.
In April, the company's technical innovation and technical revolution movement entered a new stage of great summarization, great promotion, and great improvement. A total of 1,410 new technologies, new processes, and new workflows were adopted throughout the month, so that the results of technical innovation played a role in production in a timely manner.
Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 30th - On the basis of overfulfilling the first quarter's production plan, Lanzhou Refinery also completed the April production plan and basic construction plan three days ahead of schedule.
As of April 27th, statistics show that the total output value plan of the entire plant was overfulfilled by 0.5%, and the output plans of major products and the trial production plans of new products have been completed or overfulfilled. Due to the increase in the yield of various products, the crude oil consumption was reduced by 2.2% compared to the plan. The capital construction and installation plan for self-managed projects was overfulfilled by 1%. While completing the task, the entire plant saved 13,180 labor workdays and also saved a large amount of raw materials and reduced production costs.
