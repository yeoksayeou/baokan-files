    Opposition!
    National Workers' Literary and Art Performance
    Gansu Province Literary and Art Delegation	Ren Qibin
A blazing May red,
Gusts of east wind raging,
Oppose the American scoundrels,
A wave of angry roars,
Like a raging fire,
Even more like a surging tide.
American imperialism,
Has committed heinous crimes.
More than three million people gathered,
A grand demonstration in front of Tiananmen,
Representing 600 million Chinese people,
Raising arms and shouting:
"Opposition! Opposition!"
We support the Soviet Union's just stance,
We oppose the U.S. imperialist aggression,
If you dare to repeat your tricks,
We will definitely crush you to pieces, never to return!

    反对！
    全国职工文艺会演
    甘肃省文艺代表团    任启滨炽烈五月红，阵阵东风猛，反对美国佬，一片怒吼声，犹如烈火烧，更似海潮涌。美帝国主义，犯下滔天罪。三百余万人集会，天安门前大示威，代表六亿中国人，奋臂高呼：“反对！反对！”我们支持苏联正义立场，我们反对美帝侵略活动，你的把戏要是竟敢重演，定叫你粉身碎骨有去无回！
