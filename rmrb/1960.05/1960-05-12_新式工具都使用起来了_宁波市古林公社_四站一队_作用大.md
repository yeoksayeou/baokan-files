    New Tools Are All Being Used
    The Great Role of the "Four Stations and One Team" in Gulin Commune, Ningbo City
    By Our Reporters Yi Xintian, Huang Keping, Yuan Shaochang

    April in the Jiangnan region is the busy season for spring plowing and rice transplanting. In late April, we arrived at Gulin Commune in Ningbo City, on the coastal plain of eastern Zhejiang. The vast fields were filled with a scene of intense and joyful activity. Everywhere, male and female commune members were busy plowing, harrowing, pulling seedlings, and transplanting rice. Everywhere there was laughter, shouts, and the clatter of machinery. The scene of bending over, busy hands, and transplanting rice seedling by seedling was gone. Each commune member had a rice transplanter in front of them, as if weaving panels of green silk with steel needles. Yu Yongfu, the commune party secretary, told us: Since establishing the "Four Stations and One Team" (Seeding Tool Station, Deep Ploughing Station, Rice Transplanter Station, Pumping Station, and Shepherd Team) this year, all kinds of new tools have been put to use. People, cattle, and tools are matched into sets, fully utilizing their effectiveness.

    Why establish the "Four Stations and One Team"? What are its functions after its establishment? With these questions in mind, we interviewed many cadres and commune members of Gulin Commune.

        Labor Organization Must Keep Up

    Gulin Commune is one of the best communes in Zhejiang Province for promoting new tools. Last year, this commune saved nearly one million workdays by promoting more than 15,000 various new tools. In this year's spring plowing production, the commune's promotion of new tools reached a new level. New machinery is now commonly used for plowing, irrigation, and rice transplanting. However, with the widespread promotion of new tools, the original labor organization had not adapted accordingly, and two new problems had emerged: one was that there were many types and quantities of new tools, but there was a lack of skilled personnel to operate them. Many commune members were learning everything but mastering nothing, so many new tools were left idle or not used effectively. The other new problem was that with a large number of new tools for operations such as seeding, plowing, transplanting, and irrigation, the original situation of single-item operations when there were few new tools was no longer suitable. There was a need for mutual connection, division of labor, and assembly-line operations.

    After discovering these two new problems, the Gulin Commune Party Committee, after careful research and discussion, believed that new labor organizations must be established accordingly in order to better utilize the new tools. Thus, the organizational form of the "Four Stations and One Team" was born. In addition to the pumping station established by the commune, production teams established one hundred and eleven seeding tool stations, deep plowing stations, and rice transplanter stations, thirty-seven shepherd teams, and production groups established more than five hundred operation groups and more than one hundred cattle herding groups. Under the unified leadership of the commune and production teams, the stations rationally arranged and allocated labor, cattle, and tools, fixed more than 5,000 trained operators of various tools, forming a strong team for using new tools.

            Every Rice Transplanter Is Being Used

    "All of the 1,180 rice transplanters we promoted this year are being used. All of the more than 50,000 mu of early rice in the commune this year do not require manual transplanting," Deputy Party Secretary Shen Xinfa excitedly told us.

    How can we ensure that every transplanter is promoted and used? We asked the cadres and operators this question, and everyone unanimously talked about the role of the rice transplanter station.

    We arrived at the bustling fields and walked past many commune members who were using rice transplanters. Each rice transplanter was numbered and labeled with a name, which caught our attention. After asking carefully, we found out that the rice transplanter stations of each production team assigned each rice transplanter to a specific person, numbered them, issued registration cards, and regularly inspected them. The rice transplanter station also stipulated specific task requirements for rice transplanting for each professional operation group and each rice transplanter operator, implementing fixed personnel, fixed fields, fixed time, fixed work points, fixed quality, and fixed density specifications. In this way, who wouldn't use a rice transplanter to transplant rice? Which rice transplanter would be idle and sleeping for no reason? Taking the Jinxing Production Team as an example, after the team's rice transplanter station gradually inspected, identified, numbered, and assigned the thirty-four rice transplanters, the entire team's task of transplanting more than 1,400 mu of early rice this year was all implemented to each rice transplanter in accordance with the production team's plan for fixed quality, quantity, and time. Therefore, before rice transplanting, each rice transplanter was fully prepared, and once the date arrived, they went to the fields to transplant rice one after another.

    Perhaps some people will ask, if a rice transplanter operator is sick or has something to go out and cannot go to the field, wouldn't the rice transplanter be idle? We also thought so, but after understanding, this problem was quickly solved. Because each rice transplanter is equipped with technically trained primary and secondary operators, and some rice transplanters are operated by three people, so if one person is absent, the others use it. During the busy rice transplanting season, a two-shift or three-shift system is implemented, transplanting rice day and night without stopping the machine. So, what if the rice transplanter malfunctions and cannot be used? In addition to the rice transplanter operator being able to repair general minor faults, the rice transplanter station is equipped with a repair expert for every three rice transplanters, and also organizes a repair group to carry a "health kit" to the fields for roving repairs. In this way, which rice transplanter can be left unused?

    The same is true for rice transplanters, pumping stations, deep plows, and seeding tools. Since the establishment of the "Four Stations and One Team" organization, all kinds of new tools in this commune have been able to make the best use of their talents and show their abilities.

                   Good Use, Good Management, High Efficiency

    On the evening of April 18, Yan Hongliang, a rice transplanter operator from the Jinxing Production Team of Gulin Commune, finished transplanting the last row of rice seedlings. Qi Genhua, the deputy secretary of the Party branch, who was standing in the crowd, warmly shook his hand to congratulate him and told him: He transplanted a total of 10.2 mu today, and the row spacing was 5 by 3 inches, and the quality was very good.

    Ten point two mu, which is more than double the highest record of 4.5 mu per day created by Yan Hongliang himself last year. After the news of this high-efficiency rice transplanting spread, the commune members passed it on as a strange tale: "It's really amazing, Yan Hongliang's rice transplanting alone is equivalent to more than ten people transplanting by hand in the past!"

    The reason why Yan Hongliang's technique for using rice transplanters is so skilled is because after the commune established the "Four Stations and One Team" this year, the tools are assigned to individuals, and individuals are responsible for the use and storage of the tools. Yan Hongliang also serves as the deputy director of the rice transplanter station of the production team. Therefore, his enthusiasm for studying technology is getting higher and higher, and the work efficiency has doubled. Now, not only does he work hard to learn and practice, but he also strives to help the professional groups and rice transplanter operators of the rice transplanter station to jointly improve their operating skills.

    After the Gulin Commune established the "Four Stations and One Team", it also formulated labor quotas for the use of new tools and a responsibility system for the operation and storage of new tools. Therefore, people are more interested in learning technology, operating skills are improving faster, and the sense of responsibility for storing and protecting tools is also stronger. The pumping station operators of the commune's pumping station and the deep plough operators and rice transplanter operators of the production teams go to the fields in their spare time to practice their footsteps, techniques, and various operating skills according to the fixed tools assigned by the professional group. In the evening, they study dismantling, assembling, and repairing techniques, and exchange experiences in technical operations. Now, the operators of general new tools can skillfully use the tools, and many high-efficiency experts have emerged. For example, there are more than 100 operators in the entire commune who use deep ploughs to cultivate more than five mu per day.

                    Cattle Are Also Organized

    With the organization of labor and tools, more than 2,000 cattle in the Gulin Commune's production teams have also been organized. This is the shepherd team of the production team and the cattle herding group of the production team. Cattle are still a major source of power, and the plowing and harrowing tasks of more than 70,000 mu of arable land in the entire commune all fall on them. Therefore, after promoting various deep plows, it is necessary to correspondingly improve the past method of decentralized feeding of cattle in order to facilitate the matching of labor, tools, and cattle, so as to better exert the power of deep plows. After the Dengta Production Team established the shepherd team, it concentrated the 56 cattle of the entire team in four places according to production teams. Under the education of the Communist Youth League branch, the shepherd team consciously proposed four guarantees to the production team: (1) Guarantee to send the cattle to the fields in time to meet the needs of production; (2) Guarantee the cattle pen is dry and the cattle's belly is full; (3) Guarantee no damage to crops; (4) Guarantee that cattle are not frostbitten or heatstroked. Therefore, when the spring plowing season came, the cattle of the shepherd team were all raised fat and strong. The deep plough station implemented the "one harrow, one plow, two cattle, two people" matching method, and used strong and weak cattle together to ensure the completion of the deep ploughing plan with quality and quantity. Now, Gulin Commune has established a total of 37 shepherd teams, so that each team can match "one harrow, two plows, three cattle, four people" in deep ploughing, organically combine, and mutually promote production.

    新式工具都使用起来了
    宁波市古林公社“四站一队”作用大
    本报记者　伊心恬、黄客萍、袁绍常
    江南的4月，正是春耕插秧大忙的季节。末旬，我们来到了浙东沿海平原的宁波市古林公社。广阔的田野上，充满着一片紧张愉快景象，到处是男女社员们忙着耕田、耙田、拔秧、插秧，到处是谈笑声、呼?声、咔嚓咔嚓的机杼声；弯腰曲背、双手繁忙、一丛一丛插秧的情景看不到了，每个社员面前是一部插秧机，就像用钢针在织着一幅幅绿色绫绸。公社党委书记郁永福对我们说：今年建立“四站一队”（播种工具站、深耕犁站、插秧机站、抽水机站和牧童队）以后，样样新式工具都使用起来，人、牛、工具配成套，充分发挥了效能。
    为什么要建立“四站一队”？建立以后有那些作用？我们带着这些问题，访问了古林公社许多干部和社员。
        劳动组织跟上去
    古林公社是浙江省推广新式工具最好的公社之一。去年，这个公社由于推广了一万五千多件各种新式工具，节约了近百万个劳动日。今年春耕生产中，这个公社推广新式工具更上一层楼，耕作、灌溉、插秧都普遍有了新式机具操作了。但是，随着新式工具普遍推广，原来的劳动组织没有相适应地跟上去，曾经出现了两个新问题：一个是新式工具种类和数量多，但缺乏技术熟练的专人操作，很多社员样样都学，样样都不精，因此不少新工具闲着没用或者用不好；另一个新问题是：随着播种、耕作、插秧、灌溉等操作工序都有了大量的新工具，原来新工具很少时单项操作的情况也不相适应了，需要相互衔接、分工协作、流水作业。
    古林公社党委发现这两个新问题以后，经过认真研究讨论，认为必须相应地建立新的劳动组织，才能使新工具更好地发挥效用。这样，“四站一队”的组织形式便诞生了。除了公社建立抽水机站外，以生产队为单位建立了一百十一个播种工具站、深耕犁站和插秧机站、三十七个牧童队，以生产小队为单位建立了五百多个操作组和一百多个牧牛组。各站在公社和生产队统一领导下，合理安排和调配劳力、耕牛、工具，固定了五千多名经过训练的各种工具操作手，组成了一支强大的新式工具使用队伍。
            部部插秧机都用起来
    “我们公社今年推广的一千一百八十部插秧机，部部都使用起来了，今年全社五万多亩早稻全部不用手插了。”党委副书记沈信法兴奋地对我们说。
    怎样能做到推广一部、使用一部呢？我们向干部、操作手提出这个问题，大家不约而同地谈起了插秧机站的作用。
    我们到了热闹的田野，走过了许多正在用插秧机插秧的社员面前，每部插秧机都编有号码、写上名字，这引起了我们的注意。仔细一问，原来是各生产队的插秧机站把每一部插秧机都落实到人，定人编号，发登记卡片，经常检查。插秧机站还给各专业操作小组和每个插秧机手规定了插秧的具体任务要求，实行定人、定田、定时间、定工分、定质量、定密植规格。这样一来，哪一个人会不用插秧机插秧呢？哪一部插秧机会无缘无故地闲着睡觉呢？以我们访问过的金星生产队为例，这个队的插秧机站把三十四部插秧机逐步检查鉴定、编号定人后，将全队今年种植的一千四百多亩早稻插秧任务，全部按照生产队规划定质、定量、定时间的落实到每一部插秧机，因此，在插秧以前，每部插秧机都一切准备停当，日期一到，就先后下田插秧了。
    也许有人会问，如果插秧机手生病或者有事外出不能下田时，那插秧机不是要闲起来吗？我们也这样想过，但是一了解，这个问题很快就解决了。因为每一部插秧机都配备上经过技术训练的正副操作手，还有些插秧机配有三个人操作，一人缺假，其他人用。插秧大忙时，还实行两班或三班制，停人不停机地日夜插秧。那么，插秧机发生故障不能用时，怎么办呢？这除了插秧机手会修一般小毛病外，插秧机站按每三部插秧机配备一个修配能手，同时组织修配组带着“保健箱”到田头巡回修理。这样，还有哪一部插秧机能够闲着不用呢？
    插秧机如此，其他抽水机、深耕犁、播种工具也如此。自从建立起“四站一队”这个组织形式后，这个公社各种新工具都做到各尽其能、各显神通了。
                   用好管好工效高
    4月18日傍晚，古林公社金星生产队插秧机手严宏良插完了最后一排秧，站在人丛中的党支部副书记戚根华，热情地向他握手道贺，并且告诉他：今天他一共插了十亩二分，行株距是五乘三寸，质量都很好。
    十亩二分，这比去年严宏良自己创造的日插四亩五分的最高纪录还高一倍多。这个插秧高工效消息传开后，社员们都传为奇谈：“真了不得，严宏良一个人插秧，抵得我们过去十多个人用手插哩！”
    严宏良使用插秧机的技术所以那么熟练，是因为今年公社建立“四站一队”以后，工具落实到人，使用和保管工具都由个人负责。严宏良还担任了生产队插秧机站的副站长，因此，他钻研技术的积极性越来越高，工效就成倍地提高了。现在，他不但自己勤学苦练，还努力帮助插秧机站各专业组、插秧机手共同提高操作技术。
    古林公社建立了“四站一队”以后，还制订了使用新工具的劳动定额和新工具操作、保管上的责任制。因此，人们对学习技术的兴趣更高了，操作技术提高得更快，对保管和爱护工具的责任心也更强了。公社抽水机站的抽水机手和生产队的深耕犁手、插秧机手们，根据专业组分配的固定工具，抽空就到田间去练习脚步、手法和各种操作技术，晚上就学习拆卸、装配和修理方面的技术，交流技术操作的经验。现在一般新工具的操作手，都能熟练地使用工具，出现了许多高工效能手。如使用深耕犁日耕五亩以上的操作手，全公社就有一百多名。
                    牛也组织起来了
    随着劳力、工具组织起来，古林公社各生产队的两千多头牛也组织起来了。这就是生产队的牧童队和生产小队的牧牛组。耕牛，现在还是一种主要动力，全社七万多亩耕地的耕耙任务全落在它们的身上。因此，在推广各种深耕犁以后，必须相应地改进过去分散饲养耕牛的办法，以便于实行劳力、工具和耕牛配套，才能更好地发挥深耕犁的威力。灯塔生产队成立牧童队以后，将全队五十六头牛按生产小队为单位集中分养在四处，牧童队在团支部教育下，自觉地向生产队提出了四条保证：（1）保证及时把牛送到田，满足生产需要；（2）保证牛栏燥、牛肚饱；（3）保证不损坏农作物；（4）保证牛不受冻不中暑。因此，当春耕季节到来的时候，牧童队的耕牛头头养得肥壮，深耕犁站实行了“一耙、一犁、二牛、二人”的配套法，把强牛、弱牛搭配使用，保证按质按量完成了深耕计划。现在，古林公社共建立了三十七个牧童队，使各队在深耕中把“一耙、二犁、三牛、四人”配成套，有机结合，互相促进生产。
