    Cuban Revolution Can Crush Aggression
    Bulas·Luojia, General Secretary of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba
    Basic Characteristics of the Current Revolutionary Situation
    There are three characteristics in the current revolutionary situation in Cuba that should be regarded as fundamental.
    One characteristic is the progress and deepening of the revolution.
    Another characteristic is the intensifying aggression of the U.S. imperialists against the Cuban revolution. The U.S. imperialists are trying every means, even resorting to the most vicious methods, to suppress the Cuban revolution, although they wear the mask of "patience and restraint"—a mask intended to deceive the people of Latin America.
    The third characteristic is the increasingly clear demarcation between the revolutionary and counter-revolutionary camps. The revolution is uniting around the revolutionary government and its beloved leader, Fidel Castro. The counter-revolution is gathering around the U.S. imperialists and their most prominent agents, preparing to invade our country and help foreign countries occupy it, as a guarantee of their despicable interests.
    Progress and Deepening of the Revolution
    Now, let us give some examples to illustrate the progress of the revolution.
    The first thing to point out is the progress in implementing land reform. Land reform is eliminating the semi-feudal latifundia system and giving land to farmers and cooperatives, which are the main forms of agricultural production in Cuba. The expropriation of land formerly occupied by imperialist sugar companies has now begun. More than 120,000 caballerías (one caballería equals 201.45 acres) of land owned by U.S. imperialist sugar factories will be transferred to Cuban farmers and agricultural cooperatives. At the same time, People's Stores, which sell good commodities to farmers at low prices, are developing in all agricultural areas.
    Another fact illustrating the progress of the revolution is that workers, farmers, and people's militias are organized and growing rapidly. Faced with the aggression and threats of the imperialists and counter-revolutionaries, the revolutionary government is militarily training and organizing the people and giving them weapons. This is very important. With weapons in the hands of workers and farmers, the revolution is guaranteed and cannot be stopped.
    Other facts that show the deepening of the Cuban revolution include: the joint communiqué signed by Fidel Castro and A. I. Mikoyan on February 13, which guaranteed that both sides would work together in the United Nations for peace, the coexistence, friendship, and cooperation of all nations; the trade agreement signed between Cuba and the Soviet Union, under which the Soviet Union will purchase one million tons of our sugar each year and provide us with a loan of 100 million pesos (equivalent to U.S. dollars) to develop our industry, with an annual interest rate of 2.5% and a repayment period of twelve years; increasing or establishing trade relations with other socialist countries, such as the People's Republic of China (which recently bought 80,000 tons of our sugar), Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and Poland; increasing or establishing trade relations with Asian and African countries participating in the Bandung Conference; and developing cultural exchanges with socialist countries. The development of these trade and cultural relations is extremely important for both Cuba and the cause of world peace. For Cuba, it is a decisive step forward in shattering the pro-imperialist authorities and politicians' sixty years of subservience to Washington's will in Cuban foreign policy, and in eliminating the colonialist monopoly that the United States has maintained over Cuban import and export trade in the past. For the cause of world peace, the development of these relations with socialist countries means that Latin America, led by Cuba, has begun to deviate from the U.S.'s anti-socialist and bellicose foreign policy. Despite the relaxation of world tensions and the preparations for a summit conference, the U.S. government continues to maintain this policy worldwide. If the U.S. loses its control over the foreign policies and entire lives of Latin American countries today, it will be difficult for it to continue to intensify its Cold War policy, to obstruct the easing of international tensions, to encourage the Adenauer clique and their accomplices to take war risks with the intention of fighting local wars, and it will be even more difficult to provoke the risk of launching a world war.
    Another indication of the progress of the revolution is the increased unity of the people and all revolutionary classes and organizations, and the strengthening of the revolutionary nature of the cabinet under the leadership of Fidel Castro, with President Osvaldo Dorticós participating. Faced with the attacks of reactionaries and U.S. imperialists, the revolution has become more revolutionary and more anti-imperialist; the left-wing forces have strengthened their positions, and the progressive forces among workers, farmers, the middle class, and the national bourgeoisie have united more closely around them. This is extremely important, because we know that as long as the people are united and determined to fight to the end, the revolution is invincible.
    U.S. Aggression Against Cuba
    Conspiracy Intensifies Daily
    The intensifying aggression of U.S. imperialists against the Cuban revolution is very obvious and prominent to the whole world.
    U.S. imperialists have focused their attention mainly on the Cuban revolution and are trying every means to suppress it. They originally thought that after Batista's downfall, a middle-of-the-road government would come to power, which would operate within Washington's orbit, although it might take certain revolutionary measures on issues of no decisive significance to deceive the people.
    But this estimate failed.
    Later, they thought that Urrutia, who served as President of the Republic, as well as the right-wing elements and *prattistas* (note) who occupied the majority in the cabinet, would betray the revolution and turn the revolution against communism.
    This hope also failed.
    Urrutia, the right-wing elements, and the *prattistas* separated from the cabinet, and the revolution was consolidated.
    The imperialists fear the Cuban revolution because it is a real revolution, because it not only does not give in to imperialism, but also uncompromisingly defends the integrity of national sovereignty, and strives to achieve unconditional economic independence.
    The imperialists fear the Cuban revolution, especially because it is having a huge impact among the people of Latin America, and they see from the experience and development of the Cuban revolution that Latin American countries can establish sovereign governments, that there is no reason to submit to the demands of Washington and its monopoly groups, and that Latin America can achieve economic independence, economic development, and the happiness of its people by relying on its own forces, which are well utilized, controlled, and led.
    Therefore, U.S. imperialists are impatient to eliminate the Cuban revolution, and are determined to take any means, even military intervention in Cuba.
    The imperialists have committed all kinds of anti-Cuban crimes.
    The rulers of the United States say that their policy towards Cuba is one of patience and waiting, but at the same time, U.S.-made gangster planes, piloted by Americans, taking off from airports on U.S. territory, come to Cuba to distribute defamatory counter-revolutionary leaflets and drop incendiary bombs to burn our sugarcane. This year, these planes have carried out more than forty gangster-style raids on Cuba. In just one month, more than 19 million *arrobas* (one *arroba* equals 11.338 kilograms) of sugarcane were set ablaze.
    They originally thought that burning our sugarcane would obstruct production this sugar season and intimidate the people. But neither the former nor the latter attempt achieved its purpose.
    Not a single stalk of sugarcane that was hit and set on fire was lost. Thanks to the mobilization of the masses, who worked selflessly and enthusiastically to rescue it, the sugarcane that was hit and set on fire was immediately harvested and then used to make sugar.
    Neither the people nor the revolutionary government were intimidated. The people's response was to donate two days' wages to "wherever we can buy weapons and planes" to buy these things. The revolutionary government's response was to condemn to the world the intolerable aggression of the United States, a large country, against Cuba—a small island without defensive capabilities.
    In the past, they attempted to use their Dominican stooge Trujillo's hand to strangle the Cuban revolution. Now, they are personally directing and executing anti-Cuban plans. They are sending agents to Cuba, instructing the mercenaries they have recruited to prepare to assassinate the main leaders of the revolution. They are putting pressure on Latin American countries, attempting to isolate Cuba, boycott Cuba, and help use the Organization of American States to carry out armed intervention against our small island nation, just as they did in the past with armed intervention in Korea under the banner of the United Nations. This is the main purpose of Eisenhower's visit to four South American countries. The imperialists are trying to deceive Latin American countries and their governments, saying that the Cuban revolution is a threat to them. But, obviously, Cuba, a small country, poses no threat to any of its neighbors.
    When the revolution had just won, there were some anarchist groups who attempted to organize expeditions, such as the expedition to Panama. But the revolutionary government stopped these activities and prevented such activities from happening again. Raúl Castro, Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, made it very clear: the Cuban revolution is not an export commodity.
    The Only Threat is U.S. Imperialism
    For the people, countries, and governments of Latin America, the only real threat is U.S. imperialism, which has repeatedly organized reactionary coups, and it has fostered, sheltered, and supported dictators, including Odria, Rojas Pinilla, Pérez Jiménez, and Batista, who have been overthrown by the people's bloody struggles, and dictators such as Somoza, Trujillo, and Stroessner, who still maintain their regimes on the blood and pain of the people; it is U.S. imperialism that corrupts, buys, and oppresses those in power and politicians, causing them to betray their programs and break their promises, while carrying out bloody suppression of workers and democratic movements, and promoting austerity plans and the provisions of the so-called Fourth Point Program, whose role is only to cultivate colonial servility, eliminate everything national in the country, and increase poverty; it is U.S. imperialism that obstructs the governments of Latin American countries from implementing any economic and social reforms and any plans and measures they deem appropriate for the independent development of their national economies.
    In the view of the Cuban revolutionary government, the people of every country in Latin America will carry out their own revolutions and social and economic reforms in the forms and methods they deem appropriate and possible, at the time they deem appropriate and possible. The Cuban people will support all struggles waged by the people of Latin American countries to win and defend their national sovereignty, independence, and economic, social, and political rights. Because mutual support is the responsibility of all countries, especially the brotherly people who are linked together by geography, language, and history, by the common problems they currently face, and by the common desire to strive for sovereignty, independence, social and economic development, and peace.
    The imperialists are arming Batista elements and counter-revolutionaries such as Díaz Lanz, who fled Cuba due to the victory and advancement of the revolution. To support these counter-revolutionaries, they have also gathered German Nazis and Spanish Falangists with rich military and banditry experience. They are attempting to form such elements into a well-equipped army, which even possesses planes and paratroopers to be used in the anti-Cuban war. If they cannot achieve victory, their actions can in any case be used as a pretext for U.S. Marines to intervene.
    Recently, they have attempted to use Cuba's neighbors, such as Guatemala, to create tensions between Cuba and these countries, declare a state of war, and use this situation to arrange for intervention by the Organization of American States, which is precisely the tool of the U.S. State Department to impose its decisions and policies on Latin American countries.
    The Cuban revolutionary government has expressed its opposition to the Rio de Janeiro Treaty and the Caracas Declaration adopted by the Organization of American States conferences accepted by the dictators of various countries, and has declared that it will never allow intervention in our country in the name of the Declaration and the Treaty.
    In the U.S. military intervention plan in Cuba, the U.S. naval base in Caimanera plays an important role. Everyone knows that this base is built on Cuban territory. They have strengthened the base's armaments, built barriers around the base with sandbags, and told their personnel to "stay alert" because they expect the Cubans to launch an attack. For any reasonable person, the claim that Cuba might be preparing to launch any attack on this naval base is absurd and unbelievable. But the imperialists can use such lies to fabricate a self-inflicted attack to find an excuse for its heinous crime of invading Cuba from its own territory.
    At the same time, as the Cuban government has exposed, the actual situation is that the U.S. authorities have hired former Batista soldiers at this naval base and are sheltering anti-Cuban counter-revolutionary activities.
    Now the imperialists are no longer satisfied with their journalists—reporters from news agencies such as United Press International, Associated Press, and the U.S. Information Agency, their congressmen, colonels, and lower-ranking officials making anti-Cuban remarks, and stubbornly insisting on propaganda that slanders our country. Now Secretary of State Herter and President Eisenhower of the "most powerful" country are personally attacking Cuba and greatly slandering the Cuban revolution. It was President Eisenhower himself who wrote to the U.S. Congress, requesting authorization to reduce the Cuban sugar quota and to force the Cuban people to submit through the threat of hunger. It was President Eisenhower himself who directly spread rumors and slanders and fiercely attacked the revolutionary government and Fidel Castro. President Eisenhower shamelessly said that Fidel Castro betrayed the ideals of the Cuban revolution.
    Who is Eisenhower, and what right does he have to talk about the ideals of the Cuban revolution? Who can understand the ideals of the Cuban revolution, is it Eisenhower, who used to help the Batista tyrant against the Cuban revolution? Or is it the Cuban people, who made the revolution with their own blood and struggle? Fidel said it right, if he had betrayed the revolution, then Eisenhower would call him a loyal friend of the West, just as he now calls Franco.
    The main propaganda weapon used by the imperialists against the Cuban revolution is to carry out anti-communism and division everywhere. Fidel is right in refuting those who engage in anti-communist propaganda, saying that anti-communism is a weapon used by the enemies of the revolution to divide our country and defeat us.
    The Cuban Revolution Will Surely Overcome All
    Threats and Aggression
    Faced with threats and attacks on the Cuban revolution, the people are closely united around their government to defend and safeguard the revolution.
    The militia organization has taken on a mass scale.
    The Revolutionary Army has consolidated its ranks, strengthened its quality, and improved its discipline and military knowledge.
    The masses donate their wages and jewelry to purchase weapons needed for national defense.
    The people's vigilance against counter-revolutionaries, traitors, and their divisive agents has been strengthened.
    The people are not only preparing to defend the revolution against armed aggression, but also enthusiastically engaged in economic construction, donating 4% of their wages to implement industrialization, and supporting every progress made by the revolution in the economic, social, and political fields.
    The Cuban people are determined to make any sacrifice for their revolution.
    The Cuban people are determined to rather starve or sacrifice in battle than to kneel to the imperialists and accept their orders.
    The Cuban people are receiving growing support from the brotherly people of Latin America. Their prominent figures, their trade unions, their farmers, their patriotic, progressive, and revolutionary political leaders have clearly expressed their friendly feelings towards Cuba and their determination to defend Cuba when it suffers imperialist aggression. In some Latin American countries, donation campaigns have been launched to buy planes for Cuba. In many Latin American countries, citizens have signed up to join volunteer armies, preparing to fight against the aggressors when Cuba is attacked.
    The newly liberated countries of Asia and Africa have also expressed their friendship and support for Cuba. Many of these countries are preparing to go to Havana this September to attend the conference of underdeveloped countries initiated by the Cuban government.
    The Cuban revolution has received the sympathy and support of socialist countries. The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and other socialist countries have expressed their sincere friendship to Cuba and the Cuban people through practical actions and statements.
    The workers and people of Europe and the world regard the struggle of the Cuban people as their own struggle, and they sincerely support the efforts of the Cuban people to defend their sovereignty and right to self-determination.
    The workers and progressive democrats in the United States, not deceived by the propaganda of their own imperialists, uphold and defend the rights of the Cuban people.
    Because of all this, we firmly believe that the Cuban revolution will surely overcome all threats or any aggression that may occur.
    The Cuban revolution is today a reality and a hope.
    The complete victory of the Cuban revolution will have world significance, just as its development has already had today.
    We Cuban communists give the greatest support to the revolutionary government, we are strongly united with the people of the whole country around Prime Minister Fidel Castro, we take defending the revolution and promoting the revolution as our central task, and we are prepared to make any contribution and sacrifice.
    Like every Cuban, our slogan is: Defend the motherland to the death.
    (Special contribution to this newspaper, subheadings added by the editor of this newspaper)
    (Note) In Cuba, those who have the idea of subservience to U.S. imperialism, those who do not believe that Cuba can have a sovereign government that acts according to the demands and needs of the people are called *prattistas* by us.

    古巴革命能够粉碎侵略
    古巴人民社会党总书记　布拉斯·罗加
    目前革命形势的基本特点
    古巴目前的革命形势中有三个特点应该视为基本特点。
    一个特点是革命的进展和深刻化。
    另一个特点是美帝国主义者对古巴革命的侵略阴谋日益加紧。美帝国主义者千方百计地、甚至不惜使用最凶恶的手段，力图把古巴革命镇压下去，虽然他们戴着“耐心和克制”的脸谱——目的在于欺骗拉丁美洲人民的脸谱。
    第三个特点是革命和反革命营垒的界限日益分明。革命正以革命政府及其敬爱的领袖菲德尔·卡斯特罗为中心团结起来。反革命正在美帝国主义者及其最突出的代理人周围纠合起来，准备侵略我国和帮助外国进行占领，以此作为他们卑鄙利益的保障。
    革命的进展和深刻化
    我们现在就来举例说明一下表现出革命进展的几件事情。
    首先应该指出的是实施土地改革方面的进展。土地改革正在消灭半封建的大庄园制度，把土地交给农民和作为古巴发展农业生产主要形式的合作社。现在已经开始征用过去被帝国主义糖业公司霸占的土地。美帝国主义者的糖厂所占有的十二万多卡瓦耶里亚（一卡瓦耶里亚等于二百零一点四五亩）土地将转归古巴农民和农业合作社所用。同时，把好的商品以低廉的价格卖给农民的人民商店正在所有的农业地区发展起来。
    另一个说明革命进展的事实是，工人、农民和人民民兵组织起来，并且迅速地壮大起来。面对着帝国主义者和反革命分子的侵略和威胁，革命政府在军事上训练和组织人民，并把武器交给他们。这一点非常重要。工人和农民有了武器，革命就有了保障，就不可能被阻挡住了。
    表明古巴革命深刻化的其他事实有：菲德尔·卡斯特罗和阿·伊·米高扬2月13日签署了古—苏联合公报，公报保证双方在联合国中为和平、各国人民的共处、友好和合作而共同努力；古巴和苏联签订了贸易协定，苏联根据这个协定每年购买我们一百万吨糖，并向我们提供用来发展我国工业的一亿比索（与美元同值）的贷款，这笔贷款年利二厘五，十二年还清；增进或开始建立同其他社会主义国家，例如中华人民共和国（它最近买了我们八万吨糖）、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国和波兰等国的贸易关系；增进或开始建立同参加万隆会议的亚非国家的贸易关系；发展了同社会主义国家的文化交流。这些贸易和文化关系的发展，无论对古巴，还是对世界和平的事业，都是极为重要的。就古巴说来，对于粉碎亲帝国主义的当权者和政客六十年来所保持的古巴对外政策屈从华盛顿意旨的状况，对于消除美国过去所保持的对古巴进出口贸易的殖民主义垄断，这都是向前迈出的决定性的一步。就世界和平事业来说，发展同社会主义国家的这些关系，意味着拉丁美洲以古巴为先导，已经开始背离美国反社会主义和好战的对外政策。尽管世界紧张局势有了和缓并准备召开最高级会议，美国政府仍然在世界范围内保持这种政策。如果美国失去了它今天对拉丁美洲国家对外政策和全部生活的控制，它就难以继续加紧推行它的冷战政策，就难以再阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和，难以再鼓励阿登纳之流及其同伙抱着打局部战争的企图去进行战争冒险，也更难挑起进行世界战争的冒险了。
    另一个表明革命进展的情况是，人民及各革命阶级和革命组织的团结的增进，以及在菲德尔·卡斯特罗领导下的、有奥斯瓦耳多·多尔蒂科斯总统参加的内阁的革命性的加强。面对着反动分子和美帝国主义者的攻击，革命更加革命化和更加反帝国主义了；左派力量加强了他们的阵地，工人、农民、中产阶层和民族资产阶级中的进步力量更紧密地在他们的周围团结起来了。这是极为重要的，因为我们知道，只要人民团结一致和坚决战斗到底，革命就是不可战胜的。
    美国对古巴的侵略
    阴谋日益加紧
    美帝国主义者对古巴革命的侵略阴谋日益加紧，这对全世界说来都是非常明显和突出的。
    美帝国主义者把注意力主要集中于古巴革命，并且千方百计地企图把它镇压下去。他们原以为，巴蒂斯塔倒台之后，上台的将是一个中间政府，这个政府将在华盛顿的轨道内运转，虽然它可能在没有决定意义的问题上采取某些革命措施来欺骗人民。
    但是，这种估计落了空。
    后来，他们又以为，担任共和国总统的乌鲁蒂亚以及在内阁中占多数的右派分子及普拉特分子（注）会叛变革命，并使革命转而反共。
    这种希望也落了空。
    乌鲁蒂亚、右派分子及普拉特分子从内阁中分离出去了，革命得到了巩固。
    帝国主义者害怕古巴革命，因为这是一次真正的革命，因为它非但不向帝国主义让步，而且不妥协地维护着国家主权的完整，并在争取获得无条件的经济独立。
    帝国主义者害怕古巴革命，特别是因为它在拉丁美洲人民当中发生着巨大的影响，并使他们从古巴革命的经验和发展中看到，拉丁美洲国家可以建立主权政府，没有任何理由屈从华盛顿及其垄断集团的要求，看到拉丁美洲依靠自己很好地加以利用、控制和领导的力量是能够取得经济独立、经济发展和人民幸福的。
    因此，美帝国主义者才迫不及待地要消灭古巴革命，并且决心不惜采取任何手段，甚至对古巴进行军事干涉。
    帝国主义者犯下了各种各样的反古巴的罪行。
    美国的统治者说，他们对古巴的政策是耐心和等待的政策，但是同时，美国制造的、由美国人驾驶的、从美国领土上的机场起飞的强盗飞机，却到古巴散发诽谤性的反革命传单，投掷烧夷弹来焚烧我们的甘蔗。今年以来，这些飞机已经对古巴进行了四十多次强盗式的侵袭。仅仅在一个月中就有一千九百多万阿罗瓦
  （一阿罗瓦等于一一点三三八公斤）的甘蔗中弹起火。
    他们原以为，焚毁我们的甘蔗就可以阻挠这个榨糖季节的生产和吓倒人民。但是，无论是前一个还是后一个企图都没有达到目的。
    中弹起火的甘蔗连一根也没有损失。由于群众动员起来，忘我和热情地进行抢救，中弹起火的甘蔗都立刻被收割，然后榨制蔗糖了。
    无论是人民还是革命政府都没有被吓倒。人民的回答是捐献两天的工资到“卖给我们武器和飞机的地方”去购买这些东西。革命政府的回答是向全世界谴责作为一个大国的美国对古巴——一个没有防御能力的小岛进行的令人难以容忍的侵略。
    过去，他们企图利用他们的多米尼加走狗特鲁希略的手扼杀古巴革命。现在，他们却亲自出马来指挥和执行反古巴的计划了。他们派特务到古巴，指使他们物色的雇佣分子，准备暗杀革命的主要领袖。他们正在向拉丁美洲国家施加压力，企图使这些国家的政府孤立古巴，抵制古巴，并帮助利用美洲国家组织对我们这个小小的岛国进行武装干涉，正像过去在联合国的旗号之下武装干涉朝鲜一样。艾森豪威尔访问南美四国的主要目的就是如此。帝国主义者力图欺骗拉丁美洲国家及其政府，说什么古巴革命是对他们的威胁。但是，显然，古巴这个小国对它的任何邻国都不构成威胁。
    在革命刚刚胜利的时候，有一些无政府主义集团企图组织远征队，例如对巴拿马的远征队。但是革命政府制止了这些活动，并且使这样的活动没有再次发生。革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗说得很清楚：古巴革命不是出口货。
  唯一的威胁是美帝国主义
    对拉丁美洲的人民、国家和政府来说，唯一的真正威胁是美帝国主义，正是美帝国主义一再组织反动政变，正是它扶植、庇护和支持独裁者，其中有已被人民的流血斗争推翻的俄德利亚、罗哈斯·皮尼亚、佩雷兹·希门尼斯和巴蒂斯塔等人，有像索摩查、特鲁希略和斯特罗斯纳等仍然在人民的鲜血和痛苦上维持着政权的独裁者；正是美帝国主义腐蚀、收买和压迫执政者和政界人士，使他们背叛自己的纲领和背弃自己的诺言，而对工人和民主运动进行血腥镇压，推行节约计划和所谓第四点计划的规定，其作用仅仅是培养殖民奴化思想，消除国家一切具有民族性的东西和增加贫困；正是它阻挠拉丁美洲各国政府实行它们认为适宜的独立发展本国经济的任何经济、社会改革和任何计划、措施。
    在古巴革命政府看来，拉丁美洲每一个国家的人民都将在他们认为适当和可能的时候，以他们认为适当和可能的形式和办法进行自己的革命和社会经济改革。古巴人民将支援拉丁美洲各国人民所进行的一切争取和保卫他们的民族主权、独立以及经济、社会和政治的斗争。因为互相支持是各国人民的责任，被地理、语言和历史，被目前面对着的共同问题，被争取主权、独立、社会及经济发展和和平的共同愿望联结在一起的兄弟人民就更是如此。
    帝国主义者正在武装由于革命的胜利和前进而逃出古巴的巴蒂斯塔分子和迪亚斯·兰斯之流的反革命分子。为了支援这些反革命分子，又纠合了富有军事和盗匪经验的德国纳粹分子和西班牙的长枪党徒。他们企图把这样一些分子组成一支装备精良的军队，这支军队甚至拥有用来投入反古巴战争的飞机和伞兵。如果他们不能取得胜利的话，他们的行动也无论如何都可以被用来作为美国海军陆战队进行干涉的借口。
    最近他们企图利用古巴的邻国如危地马拉等制造古巴和这些国家间的紧张局势，宣布战争状态，并借助于这种情况来安排美洲国家组织的干涉，美洲国家组织正是美国国务院把它的决定和方针强加给拉丁美洲国家的工具。
    古巴革命政府已表示反对由各国的独裁者所接受的美洲国家组织会议通过的里约热内卢公约和加拉加斯宣言，并宣布它决不允许以宣言和公约的名义干涉我国。
    在美国军事干涉古巴的计划中，美国在卡伊马内拉的海军基地起着重要的作用。大家知道，这个基地是建立在古巴的领土上的。他们已经加强了基地的军备，用沙袋在基地四周筑起障碍物，并告诉他们的人员要“保持警惕”，因为他们预料古巴人将发动进攻。对于任何一个有理智的人说来，古巴可能准备对这个海军基地进行任何进攻的说法都是荒谬和难以置信的。但是，帝国主义者可以用这样的谎言制造一次自我进攻，来为它从自己的领土入侵古巴的骇人听闻的罪行寻找借口。
    同时，正像古巴政府所揭露的那样，实际情况是，美国当局在这个海军基地中雇佣了前巴蒂斯塔军人，并且庇护着反古巴的反革命活动。
    现在帝国主义者已经不满足于他们的记者——合众国际社、美联社和美新处等通讯社的记者、他们的议员、上校和较低级的官员们发表反对古巴的言论，和顽固地坚持诽谤我国的宣传了。现在是国务卿赫脱和“最强大的”国家的总统艾森豪威尔亲自出马来攻击古巴和大肆诽谤古巴革命了。是艾森豪威尔总统本人写信给美国国会，要求授权降低古巴食糖定额以及用饥饿威胁来迫使古巴人民屈服的。是艾森豪威尔总统本人直接造谣诽谤并猛烈攻击革命政府和菲德尔·卡斯特罗的。艾森豪威尔总统厚颜无耻地说，菲德尔·卡斯特罗背叛了古巴革命的理想。
    艾森豪威尔是什么人，他有什么权利议论古巴革命的理想呢？谁能够了解古巴革命的理想，是过去帮助巴蒂斯塔暴君反对古巴革命的艾森豪威尔呢？还是用自己的鲜血和奋斗进行了革命的古巴人民呢？菲德尔说得对，假如他背叛了革命的话，那末艾森豪威尔就会像他现在称呼佛朗哥一样称他为西方的忠诚朋友了。
    帝国主义反对古巴革命的主要宣传武器就是无孔不入地进行反共和分裂。菲德尔在驳斥那些进行反共宣传的人时说得对，反共是革命的敌人企图用来分裂我国和击败我们而使用的武器。
    古巴革命一定能战胜一切
    威胁和侵略
    面对着对古巴革命的威胁和攻击，人民紧紧地团结在他们的政府周围来保卫和维护革命。
    民兵组织具有了群众性的规模。
    起义军巩固了他们的队伍、锻炼了他们的素质，提高了他们的纪律性和军事知识。
    群众献出他们的工资和首饰来购买国防所需要的武器。
    人民对反革命分子、叛徒及其进行分裂的代理人的警惕加强了。
    人民不仅仅准备保卫革命反对武装侵略，而且热情地投入经济建设，他们捐献出4％的工资来实行工业化，并且支持革命在经济、社会和政治方面的每一个进展。
    古巴人民决心为了他们的革命而不惜任何牺牲。
    古巴人民决心宁可忍饥挨饿或在战斗中牺牲，也不愿意向帝国主义者屈膝和接受他们的命令。
    古巴人民得到拉丁美洲各兄弟人民日益增长的支持。他们的知名人士，他们的工会，他们的农民，他们的爱国、进步和革命的政治领导人明确地表示了他们与古巴友好的感情和他们在古巴遭受帝国主义侵略时保卫古巴的决心。在一些拉丁美洲国家中进行了为古巴购买飞机的捐款运动。在许多拉丁美洲国家里，公民们报名参加志愿军，准备在古巴遭到进攻时为反对侵略者而战。
    亚洲和非洲新解放的国家也表示了它们对古巴的友谊和支持。其中有许多国家都准备在今年9月到哈瓦那去参加古巴政府发起召开的不发达国家会议。
    古巴革命得到社会主义国家的同情和支持。苏联、中华人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家以实际行动和声明向古巴和古巴人民表示了他们真诚的友谊。
    欧洲和全世界的工人和人民把古巴人民的斗争看作自己的斗争，他们真诚地支持古巴人民为维护主权和自决权而进行的努力。
    美国的工人和进步民主人士，没有受本国帝国主义者宣传的欺骗，他们维护和捍卫着古巴人民的权利。
    由于这一切，我们坚信古巴革命一定会战胜一切威胁或者一旦发生的侵略。
    古巴革命今天是一种现实和希望。
    古巴革命的完全胜利将具有世界意义，正如它的发展今天已经具有的意义一样。
    我们古巴共产党人给予革命政府以最大的支持，我们和全国人民一起坚强地团结在菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理的周围，我们以保卫革命和推进革命作为中心任务，准备做出任何贡献和牺牲。
    同每个古巴人一样，我们的口号也是：誓死保卫祖国。
