Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 21st: Over 30,000 Yangtze River sailors, dockworkers, and ship repair workers in Wuhan Port, as well as workers and farmers in the Daye Tieshan area, have held rallies to resolutely support the Japanese people's just struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique's use of fascist means to forcibly pass the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

    Yesterday, the crew members of the Jiangya and Jianghan ships, who had just arrived in Wuhan Port, held rallies after arriving in port without even eating. Mei Renfu, the captain of the Jiangya ship who had been brutally beaten by Japanese invaders, and Xu Lanqing, the boatswain, said angrily: "The Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique in Japan is extremely shameless and willingly acts as a running dog for U.S. imperialism. If Japanese imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression, then look at the power of our sailors and the Chinese people." Many retired veteran sailors, after hearing the news, rushed to the Seamen's Cultural Palace to participate in the rally, denouncing Kishi Nobusuke's fascist behavior.

    More than 8,000 dockworkers in Wuhan Port also held rallies, resolutely stating that they would stand with the Japanese people and fight to the end against Kishi Nobusuke, who is willing to be a running dog for U.S. imperialism.

    The Daye Tieshan area of Hubei suffered inhumane bombing and massacres by Japanese militarism. When local workers and farmers heard that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are now colluding and attempting to replay the war that occurred fifteen years ago in Asia, they were extremely angry. They have been accusing the Japanese fascist army of its crimes and expressing their firm support for the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. At a rally, Xie Fuhan, an elderly worker in his sixties, painfully recalled: "At that time, the Japanese invaders disregarded the lives of the workers and forced them to dig holes under the rocks all day long. Rocks fell from above and crushed many workers to death. I remember once the powder magazine exploded with more than 2,000 tons of explosives, and more than 300 miners were blown to death on the mountain, with bloody corpses hanging even on the utility poles below the mountain." At this time, people shouted angrily: "We will never forget the hatred of Japanese imperialism's invasion of China!" "The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are engaging in a military alliance, antagonizing the people of China and the Soviet Union and the Japanese people. This is intolerable!" "The Chinese people who have stood up have the power to eliminate any imperialism that dares to invade us."

    The commune members of the Tieshan area people's commune have also held rallies in recent days to oppose the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' act of playing with fire. Li Dongying, an elderly woman in her seventies from the Tieshan People's Commune, accused the Japanese devils at the meeting of the bloody crimes of bombing her eldest son to death, killing her second son, and burying her third son alive in 1938, and said: "The Japanese devils have not yet paid the blood debts they owe us, and U.S. imperialism wants to prop up the Japanese robbers again to continue to invade us. We will resolutely not agree to this." Lu Baogui, a commune member of the Xialu Commune, said: "I hate Japanese imperialism to the bone when I mention it." People have expressed that they will fight to the end with the Japanese people against the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. (Attached photo)

    坚决支持日本人民反对非法通过日美条约的正义斗争
    武汉港三万人集会怒斥岸信介的新罪行
    大冶铁山地区工人农民警告美日反动派
    中国人民有力量消灭任何侵略者
    据新华社武汉21日电　武汉港三万多名长江海员、码头工人和修船工人，大冶铁山地区工人和农民，纷纷举行集会，坚决支持日本人民反对岸信介反动集团使用法西斯手段强行通过日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。
    昨天，刚到武汉港的江亚轮和江汉轮的船员们，抵港后连饭也顾不上吃就举行了集会。曾受日寇毒打过的江亚轮长梅仁富和水手长徐兰庆愤怒地说：日本岸信介反动集团无耻极了，甘心当美帝国主义的走狗，如果日本帝国主义胆敢发动侵略战争，那就看着我们海员和中国人民的力量吧。许多退休的老海员知道消息后，纷纷赶到海员文化宫参加集会，痛斥岸信介的法西斯行为。
    武汉港八千余码头工人，也分别举行集会，坚决表示要同日本人民站在一起，与甘心当美帝国主义走狗的岸信介斗争到底。
    湖北大冶铁山地区遭到过日本军国主义惨无人道的轰炸和屠杀。当地工人和农民听到日美反动派现在又勾结起来，企图将十五年前的战祸在亚洲重演的时候，愤怒极了，纷纷控诉日本法西斯军队的罪行，表示要坚决支持日本人民反对美日军事同盟条约的正义斗争。在一次集会上，六十多岁的老工人谢福汉痛苦地回忆说：“那时日寇不顾工人的死活，逼着工人成天伏在岩底下打洞，矿石从上面倒下来压死很多工人，记得有一次火药库堆的两千多吨炸药爆炸了，三百多名矿工在山上被炸死，连山下电线杆上也挂着血淋淋的尸体。”这时，人们愤怒地喊道：“我们永远不会忘记日本帝国主义侵略中国的仇恨。”“美日反动派搞军事同盟，与中苏人民和日本人民为敌，这是不能容忍的。”“站起来的中国人民有力量消灭胆敢侵犯我们的任何帝国主义。”
    铁山地区的人民公社社员们，连日来也纷纷集会，反对日美反动派的玩火罪行。铁山人民公社七十多岁的老太太李冬英在会上控诉了日本鬼子1938年炸死她大儿子、杀死她二儿子、活埋她三儿子的血腥罪行后说：“日本鬼子欠下我们的血债未还，美帝国主义又想把日本强盗扶起来继续侵略我们，我们是坚决不答应的。”下陆公社社员陆保桂说：“我一提起日本帝国主义就恨之入骨。”人们纷纷表示，要和日本人民一道，和美日反动派斗争到底。（附图片）
