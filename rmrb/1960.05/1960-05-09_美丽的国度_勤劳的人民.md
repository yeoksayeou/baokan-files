Beautiful Country, Diligent People
Bian Boming, Deputy Director of the Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, is a beautiful city. It is somewhat like Chongqing in our country, a mountain city, but it is not quite the same. It has its own unique style. The Vltava River runs through the city, its ceaseless flow rippling, clear, and pleasant. The surrounding mountains set off the magnificent buildings of various forms, which are especially beautiful. Ancient castles and ruins stand on the riverbank, and there are many stone statues on Charles Bridge, exquisitely carved and lifelike. They are historical sites of Prague and also art exhibits. This prosperous city is an important stronghold in the western part of the socialist camp, its position is important and its significance is great. Last November, I and several comrades were fortunate to visit this beautiful country in order to implement the Sino-Czech Scientific Agreement. In addition to Prague, we also visited Pilsen, Karlovy Vary, Most, Brno, Bratislava, etc. Some are industrial cities, some are cultural cities, and some are scenic spots, but every city is prosperous and beautiful, fresh and clean. Although these natural landscapes and magnificent buildings are worth admiring, the more important thing is the magnificent cause made by the people under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.

    Fifteen years ago, the working people of Czechoslovakia were liberated, gained independence, and established a regime of the working people. For fifteen years, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Czechoslovakia has restored the wounds of war and vigorously engaged in production and construction. All undertakings are thriving, and everywhere is filled with a new atmosphere of production development, economic prosperity, and happy life.

    Now the level of industrial production is very high, and agriculture is also developing continuously, so people's lives are relatively good. This is the result of the tireless hard work of the working people of Czechoslovakia. The beautiful cities, elegant villages, dense forests, and smooth roads are also mostly the achievements of the Czechoslovak Communist Party leading the vast working people in unremitting efforts to carry out production and construction after liberation.

    In the past fifteen years, Czechoslovak scientists, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, have made many contributions to socialist construction. For example, Czechoslovakia is rich in brown coal. Chemists, starting from brown coal resources, have carried out a large number of studies on the comprehensive utilization of brown coal, and studied the use of coal tar as a chemical raw material to increase the yield of phenols and aromatics. Some study the use of lignite as a fiber raw material. Some scientists also attach great importance to the research of new technologies and new methods, especially in the analysis aspect, which is very prominent and has made remarkable achievements, promoting and promoting the development of scientific research. Academician Heyrovský, the founder of polarography, not only studies the basic theory of polarography, but also studies the expansion of the application range of polarographs and the improvement of instruments. He also studies micro-polarographs to make the sensitivity more precise, the operation simpler, and the efficiency higher. Since the founding of polarography, it has continued to improve in theory, the instrument design has also continued to improve, and the application range has also continued to expand. Czechoslovakia has long been in the leading position in international polarography research and has made great contributions. Professor Janák, the founder of gas chromatography, has a similar research situation on gas chromatography to the research on polarography. On the one hand, he is doing theoretical research, and at the same time, he is also studying practical problems. It has developed from the analysis of tar, petroleum gas and various industrial gases, phenol and phenol derivatives separation analysis, to the analysis of plastic intermolecules, the analysis of non-volatile substances, and the separation analysis of amino acids. This is also a leading work in the world. There are many outstanding works done by Czechoslovak scientists, which cannot be listed one by one. In short, they have done their part for socialist construction.

    Although our time in Czechoslovakia was short, the impressions were extremely deep. What is most memorable is the brotherly deep friendship of the Czechoslovak comrades to us. Academician Šorm, the director of the Institute of Chemistry of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, received us warmly despite his very busy work. In the office of Academician Heyrovský, Chinese calligraphy and paintings are hung on the wall, and a portrait of Chairman Mao is placed on the table. When he met us, he first greeted Chairman Mao's health. The words from the heart and the sincere attitude were deeply moving; it also showed how deep the friendship between the Chinese and Czech peoples is. Near Most, we also visited the homes of farmers. The great hospitality they showed us was really indescribable. No matter where it is, whether it is a city or a countryside, the flowers of friendship between the Chinese and Czech peoples are blooming everywhere.

    Although China and Czechoslovakia are more than 20,000 miles apart, high mountains and seas, vast deserts and grasslands cannot stop the deep brotherly friendship between the two peoples.

    On the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia. We would like to extend our warmest congratulations to the comrades and friends of Czechoslovakia! (with picture)

    美丽的国度　勤劳的人民
    中国科学院有机化学研究所副所长　边伯明
    捷克斯洛伐克的首都布拉格，是一座美丽的城市，它有些像我国的重庆，是一座山城，但又不很相似，而是有其独特风格的，伏尔塔瓦河贯串市中，经年不息的综综流水，涟漪清澈，幽美宜人。四围山色，衬托着各种不同形式的宏伟建筑，尤为秀丽。古堡残坦，矗立河岸，查理士桥上，石像多尊，雕工精致，神态毕肖，是布拉格的古迹，也是艺术展品。这座繁荣的大城市，是社会主义阵营西部的重要堡垒，地位是重要的，意义是巨大的。去年11月间，我和几位同志为了执行中捷科学协定，幸运的在这美丽的国家进行了参观访问。除布拉格外，还访问了比尔森、卡罗维伐立、摩斯特、布尔诺、布拉迪斯拉发等城，其中有工业城，有文化城，有风景区，但无论那个城市，都是繁荣秀美，清新洁净。这些自然景色和宏伟堂皇的建筑，虽然值得欣赏，但更主要的还不是这些，而是在捷共领导下的人们所作出的宏伟的事业。
    在十五年前，捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民获得了解放，获得了独立，建立了劳动人民的政权。十五年以来，在捷共领导下，捷克斯洛伐克恢复了战争的创伤，并大力从事生产建设，各种事业蒸蒸日上，到处洋溢着生产发展，经济繁荣，生活幸福的新气象。
    现在工业生产水平很高，农业也随之不断发展，因而人民生活都是比较好的。这是捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民孜孜不倦辛勤劳动的结果。美丽的城市，清雅的乡村，茂密的森林，平整的道路，也多是在解放后，捷共领导着广大的劳动人民，努力不懈，进行生产建设的成就。
    在十五年中，捷克斯洛伐克的科学家们，在捷共领导下，为社会主义建设，作出了不少贡献，如捷克斯洛伐克盛产褐煤，化学家们从褐煤资源出发，大量的研究褐煤综合利用，研究从煤焦油作化工原料，提高酚和芳烃的得量。有的研究利用褐煤作纤维原料。有的科学家对新技术新方法的研究也很重视，特别在分析方面，做的很突出，成绩也很显著，促进与推动了科学研究的发展。极谱学创始人、海洛克斯基院士不仅研究极谱学的基本理论，也研究极谱仪应用范围的扩大和仪器的改进。并研究微量极谱仪，使灵敏度更精密，操作更简便，效率更高。由于极谱创始后，继续不断的在理论上提高，仪器设计也不断进步，应用范围也不断扩大。使捷克斯洛伐克在极谱学的研究上，长期在国际上领先，作出了巨大贡献。气体层析创始人耶纳克教授，对气体层析的研究情况和极谱学的研究类似，一面作理论研究，同时并研究实用问题。已经从焦油的分析、石油气体及各种工业气体酚及酚的衍生物分离分析，发展到塑料交分子的分析，非挥发性物质的分析以及氨基酸的分离分析上。这也是国际上领先的工作。捷克斯洛伐克的科学家所作的出色的工作，还有不少，不能一一列举。总之他们对于社会主义建设，尽了自己的一份力量。
    我们在捷克斯洛伐克的时间虽短，印象都极为深刻。最令人怀念的是捷克斯洛伐克的同志们对我们的兄弟般的深厚友谊。捷克斯洛伐克科学院化学所所长休穆院士虽然工作十分繁忙，还热情地接待了我们。海洛克斯基院士的办公室中，墙上挂着中国字画，桌上摆着毛主席像。他见到我们时首先问候毛主席健康，那种发自肺腑的语言，真诚恳切的态度，深深令人感动；也表明中捷两国人民的友谊是如何深厚。在摩斯特附近，我们还访问了农民的家庭，他们待我们的那种隆情盛意，真是难以言语形容。无论那里，城市也好，乡村也好，处处盛开着中捷人民友谊之花。
    中国和捷克斯洛伐克虽然相距两万余里，但高山大海，辽阔的沙漠和草原，是阻挡不住两国人民兄弟般的深厚友谊的。
    值此捷克斯洛伐克解放十五周年之际。谨向捷克斯洛伐克的同志们朋友们，致以最热烈的祝贺！（附图片）
