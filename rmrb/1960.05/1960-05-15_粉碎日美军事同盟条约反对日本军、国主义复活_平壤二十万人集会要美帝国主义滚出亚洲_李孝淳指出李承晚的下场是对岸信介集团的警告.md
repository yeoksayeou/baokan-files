Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 14th - Two hundred thousand people in Pyongyang held a rally this afternoon to support the Japanese people's struggle against the new U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

　　The rally began at 6 p.m. The masses gathered in Kim Il-sung Square, holding huge banners. They constantly raised their arms and shouted slogans such as "The People of Korea and Japan Unite!", "Crush the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty!", "Oppose the Revival of Japanese Militarism!", "U.S. Imperialism Get Out of South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and South Vietnam!", "U.S. Imperialism Get Out of Asia!" and so on.

　　Participating in today's rally were: First Vice Premier of the Korean Cabinet, Kim Il; Vice Premiers of the Cabinet, Hong Myung-hee, and Jung Il-ryong; Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Park Kum-chul and Kim Chang-man; Chairman of the Korean Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, Han Seol-ya; and leaders of various democratic parties and social organizations.

　　Li Hyo-soon, member the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and Chairman of the Central Committe of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, spoke at the rally on behalf of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party. He first expressed the Korean people's full support for the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

　　He strongly condemned the U.S.-Japan reactionary clique's aggressive conspiracy to create the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. Li Hyo-soon said that the U.S.-Japan reactionary clique's military alliance treaty is directly aimed at Korea, the Soviet Union, China, and the entire socialist camp. U.S. imperialism attempts to permanently occupy Japan through this treaty, turning Japan into a strategic nuclear war base for aggression in the Far East, reviving Japanese militarism, recruiting cannon fodder in Japan, and making Japanese militarists act as its "shock troops" for aggression in the Far East and Asia. The Kishi Nobusuke group in Japan, by signing this treaty, also delusionally hopes to relive the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

　　Li Hyo-soon said that the Japanese people have launched a just struggle to oppose this conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionary clique, save their motherland, strive for survival and security, and strive for independence and democracy. The Japanese people, united and fighting to the end, will surely be able to crush the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionary clique. Li Hyo-soon said that the South Korean people heroically waged a struggle and drove the traitor Syngman Rhee from power. This is an important warning to the Kishi Nobusuke group.

　　Li Hyo-soon also condemned U.S. imperialism for continuing to illegally occupy China's Taiwan and constantly creating war threats in the Indochina Peninsula. Li Hyo-soon finally said that for the peace and security of the Far East, the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty must be resolutely crushed, U.S. troops must withdraw from South Korea and Japan, as well as from all parts of Asia, and U.S. military bases must be removed. He said that the Asian people, united, will surely drive U.S. imperialism out.

　　The rally finally passed a letter to the Japanese people. The letter said that the Korean people fully support and sympathize with the Japanese people's just struggle. Japanese militarism occupied Korea for forty years, causing great suffering to the Korean people. Like U.S. imperialism, they are criminals who invaded Korea. The Korean people will never allow U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarists to create a military alliance and threaten our security. The Korean people will continue to fight to crush the U.S.-Japan military alliance.

    粉碎日美军事同盟条约反对日本军国主义复活
    平壤二十万人集会要美帝国主义滚出亚洲
    李孝淳指出李承晚的下场是对岸信介集团的警告
    据新华社平壤14日电　平壤市二十万人今天下午举行大会，声援日本人民反对新的日美军事同盟条约的斗争。
    大会在下午六时开始。聚集在金日成广场上的群众举着巨幅的标语。他们不断振臂高呼“朝
  日两国人民团结起来！”“粉碎日美军事同盟条约！”“反对日本军国主义复活！”“美帝国主义从南朝鲜、日本、台湾、南越滚出去！”“美帝国主义从亚洲滚出去！”等口号。
    参加今天大会的有：朝鲜内阁第一副首相金一，内阁副首相洪命熹、郑一龙，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴金喆、金昌满，朝鲜亚非团结委员会委员长韩雪野和各民主政党、社会团体的负责人。
    朝鲜劳动党中央常务委员、朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会委员长李孝淳代表朝鲜劳动党中央委员会在大会上讲了话。他首先表示朝鲜人民完全支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争。
    他强烈谴责美日反动集团制造美日军事同盟条约的侵略阴谋。李孝淳说，美日反动集团的军事同盟条约的矛头是直接对着朝鲜、苏联、中国和整个社会主义阵营的。美帝国主义妄图通过这一条约永久占领日本，把日本变成侵略远东的核战争战略基地，复活日本军国主义，在日本收罗炮灰，使日本军国主义者充当它侵略远东和亚洲的“突击队”。日本岸信介集团签署这一条约，也妄想借此重温“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦。
    李孝淳说，日本人民为反对日美反动集团的这一阴谋、拯救自己的祖国、争取生存和安全、争取独立和民主展开了正义的斗争。日本人民团结起来斗争到底，必定能够粉碎美日反动集团的阴谋。李孝淳说，南朝鲜人民英勇地进行斗争，把卖国贼李承晚赶下了台。这对岸信介集团来说是一个重要的警告。
    李孝淳还谴责美帝国主义继续非法占领着中国的台湾，并且在印度支那半岛不断制造战争威胁。李孝淳最后说，为了远东的和平和安全，必须坚决粉碎美日军事同盟条约，美军必须从南朝鲜和日本以及亚洲各地撤走，必须撤除美国军事基地。他说，亚洲人民团结起来，一定要把美帝国主义赶出去。
    大会最后通过给日本人民的信。信中说，朝鲜人民完全支持和同情日本人民的正义斗争。日本军国主义强占朝鲜四十年，使朝鲜人民遭受了极大的痛苦。他们同美帝国主义一样，都是侵略朝鲜的罪犯。朝鲜人民决不能容许美帝国主义和日本军国主义者制造军事同盟，威胁我们的安全。朝鲜人民将继续斗争，粉碎日美军事同盟。
