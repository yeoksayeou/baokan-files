    Fertilizer Powder Delivered to the Farm
    Dalian Chemical Plant, Wang Yunting
What agitates the fiery hearts, burning throughout the entire plant in a state of intense activity? All that can be seen is fertilizer powder like a torrential river, flowing day and night on the conveyor belt. The workshop workers' competition is lively, and strings of sweat drops fall beside the pots. The time for discharging the pots is shortened again and again, and high-yield figures rise higher and higher. The packaging girls are anxious, and the paper rustles like flying. Quickly! Quickly! Be careful and cautious, not allowing any damage to the paper bags. The young drivers' eyes are focused, stepping on the gas and adding a pair of big wings. Truly, every moment is worth a thousand gold, racing against time to run fast and load more, quickly! Turbulent waves roll on the conveyor belt, quickly! A busy scene in the packaging room, quickly! Ten thousand vehicles on the transport road, quickly! The entire plant is tense and busy. What agitates the fiery hearts, burning throughout the entire plant in a state of intense activity? The workers' comrades have one heart, quickly deliver the fertilizer powder to the farm. Fully loaded vehicles head towards the farm, carrying our ardent hope—apply one more grain of fertilizer in the spring, and harvest ten thousand grains of grain in the autumn!
