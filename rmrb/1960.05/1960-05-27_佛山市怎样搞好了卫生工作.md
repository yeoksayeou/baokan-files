How Foshan City Has Improved Its Sanitation Work
Qu Mengjue, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee

(I)
	Foshan City is a medium-sized city in Guangdong Province. Before liberation, its municipal construction and sanitation conditions were very poor. After liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Foshan City's industrial and agricultural production has made great leaps, and sanitation work has also made great achievements. This can be seen from the improvement of the city's production and living environment, the widespread development of good hygiene habits among the people, the enhancement of the people's physical fitness, and the further improvement of labor efficiency, which has promoted production. It is now a sanitation red banner city in Guangdong Province.

	The characteristics of Foshan City's sanitation work are mainly reflected in the following aspects: First, the entire party is mobilized, and the entire people take action. It is not a matter for a single department or a group of people, but every department participates and everyone takes action. Second, the persistence and tenacity of the work. Since the large-scale sanitation campaign in 1958, it has not only been carried out vigorously and with great momentum, but also combined regular work with shock campaigns to ensure the continuous development of the movement. Third, it can proceed from production, combine with production, and serve production. In the past two years, Foshan City has not only done a good job in sanitation, but also in industrial production.

	The fact that an old, dilapidated city like Foshan, with extremely poor sanitation conditions, has fundamentally changed the sanitary appearance of the city environment through the efforts of the people over the past two years gives us great inspiration. What Foshan City can do, other cities can also do. The problem is: it depends on human effort. As long as everyone takes action, sanitation work can certainly be done well. The experience summarized in Foshan City's sanitation work can be used as a reference for other cities to carry out sanitation work. Now I will talk about a few personal insights on Foshan City's sanitation work.

(II)
	The primary key to the success of Foshan City's sanitation work is strengthening the leadership of the Party. Foshan City's sanitation work has always been carried out under the direct leadership of the Foshan Municipal Party Committee. Some key issues in sanitation work have been decided after research by the Municipal Party Committee. Foshan City's sanitation conditions were very poor in the past, and there were many objective difficulties in really getting it done. For example, eradicating sewers faced difficulties in technology, funding, labor, and raw materials. In this situation, whether to lead sanitation work with an attitude of "reformism" and a piecemeal approach, or with a revolutionary spirit, is the primary key to determining whether sanitation work can be done well. The Foshan Municipal Party Committee adopted the latter attitude. They took into account all the difficult conditions, but even more so the subjective initiative of the people. They realized that the people of Foshan City have a strong demand and desire for improving the production and living environment as their living standards continue to improve, which is the most favorable condition. Therefore, they did not bow down to difficulties, but in 1958 proposed: to transform Foshan from a handicraft city into a modern industrial city, from a dilapidated and dirty city into a clean and beautiful city, and from a city of feudal superstition into a city with national traditional culture and art within three years. Facts have proved that because the Municipal Party Committee has great determination and full of revolutionary vigor, the masses quickly mobilized.

	After the Foshan Municipal Party Committee mobilized the masses and achieved certain results in its work, it did not become complacent, relaxed, or stagnate. They always used the spirit of continuous revolution to guide the city's sanitation movement. The reason why Foshan City's sanitation movement can develop forward one upsurge after another and continuously achieve results lies here. The Foshan Municipal Party Committee is always able to fully study the situation based on the development of the movement, grasp the key issues in each period, and put forward clear slogans to mobilize the masses and arouse their enthusiasm. Because these slogans are put forward by the Municipal Party Committee after studying the situation and based on the urgent needs to be solved in each period, once the masses understand the correctness of the slogan and the slogan coincides with the problems that they urgently need to solve, they accept the task and move forward courageously, and no difficulty can stop them from advancing. The Foshan Municipal Party Committee has successively put forward slogans such as "Transforming stinky ditches into clear rivers," "Eradicating sewers," "Cementing road surfaces," "Every household strives to be a sanitary home," and "Vigorously developing sanitary model streets." These slogans have become a reality through the efforts of the masses, enabling Foshan City's sanitation movement to continuously solve a series of fundamental problems in sanitation work.

	The Foshan Municipal Party Committee's leadership in sanitation work is also reflected in the unified leadership and overall arrangement of sanitation work with other work, as well as the decentralized implementation and layer-by-layer contracting of sanitation work. In the arrangement of the relationship between sanitation work and production and central work, they implemented "four unifications" and "four to the end." "Four unifications" are: unifying ideology, unifying planning, unifying arrangements, and unifying leadership. "Four to the end" means that the Party Committee leads to the end in all fronts and departments; organizational structure and personnel allocation are to the end; specific people are responsible for specific tasks, and front-line contracting and departmental integration are to the end. The party organizations in Foshan City, starting from the Municipal Party Committee, are all headed by the first secretary for sanitation work, and there are special personnel responsible. The Municipal Party Committee also puts sanitation work on the agenda of the Municipal Party Committee Standing Committee for special discussion on a regular basis, and makes new decisions based on new situations. Among the various departments, sanitation work is arranged at the same time as the work of the departments is arranged, and sanitation work is listed as one of the regular businesses of the departments, rather than an optional work that can be added or deleted at any time. In addition, the organization of the Foshan City Patriotic Sanitation Campaign Committee is also relatively sound. The Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee are led by a secretary and a deputy mayor, and branches or groups are established separately on each front and in each department. Because of unified leadership and overall arrangement, all fronts and departments are mobilized, and all tasks are combined. With a specialized organization and dedicated personnel, the collective leadership and specialized responsibility are combined, and the leadership of sanitation becomes sound and strong.

	Of course, the Party's leadership of sanitation work is by no means limited to these aspects. However, from the experience of Foshan City, we have realized that to truly do a good job in sanitation, the Party's leadership must not only stay at holding a mobilization meeting and making general calls. Facts have proved that wherever the Party Committee only stays at general calls for sanitation work, there will be no improvement in sanitation work.

(III)
	The achievement of Foshan City's sanitation work also lies in the implementation of the mass line and the large-scale mass movement in sanitation work.

	It is true that the people of Foshan City's deep hatred of diseases and their strong desire for a clean living and production environment are the most favorable and fundamental conditions for Foshan City to launch a large-scale mass movement in sanitation work. But this does not mean that no work needs to be done, and an order can mobilize the masses. In fact, at the beginning of the movement, the masses also had various thoughts. For example, some people were not sufficiently ideologically prepared and were not conscious enough of the hard work required to change the face of the ancient city and improve sanitation; a very small number of people still had the idea of enjoying the fruits of others' labor; and the more common idea was the "Foshan backwardness theory." They believed that Foshan was old, dilapidated, and dirty, and it would be difficult to change its face in a short period of time. How to mobilize the masses well and guide and inspire everyone to consciously devote themselves to the sanitation movement was the first problem that the Foshan Municipal Party Committee had to solve. On the one hand, the Foshan Municipal Party Committee launched a debate on "What are the benefits of doing a good job in sanitation, eliminating the four pests, and us?" At the same time, it used various propaganda tools to carry out vivid and powerful propaganda, truly mobilizing the masses ideologically.

	When mobilizing the masses, the Foshan Municipal Party Committee did not only stay at general propaganda and mobilization work, but after initially solving the ideological problems of the masses, it used typical demonstrations to once again convince and educate the masses with facts, and then promoted it universally from point to area. When Foshan City eradicated sewers, carried out sanitation in factories and the catering industry, and later promoted "Sanitary Homes" and "Sanitary Model Streets," it selected some of the worst places, cleaned them up first, and then took everyone to visit. After everyone's ideological obstacles were cleared, it was spread out universally. After the movement was fully launched, they further promoted the more comprehensive development of the movement through large-scale competitions and appraisals, and commending advanced individuals. When mobilizing the masses, the Foshan Municipal Party Committee also paid attention to grasping the backward and grasping the dead ends. When the movement developed to a certain stage, the leading cadres of party organizations at all levels conducted in-depth inspections of backward units and backward areas, and then selected representative units or households to hold on-site meetings of backward units. These meetings not only criticized the backward units, but more importantly, helped them analyze the reasons for their backwardness and pointed out the aspects in which they should improve. Such meetings not only educated the backward units, but also promoted the overall situation, so that the sanitation movement tended to be balanced from imbalance, and was developed and improved, greatly promoting the wider and deeper development of the sanitation movement.

	Foshan City's sanitation work once again proves that as long as everyone takes action and fully exerts their subjective initiative, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. And some problems that seem to require a lot of money and "foreign" methods to solve can actually be solved completely with "local" methods without spending much money. This is also a very big feature of Foshan City's sanitation work. The eradication of sewers is the most concentrated and prominent manifestation of this feature. According to the most economical calculation by the construction department, the sewers, which originally required a national investment of more than 2 million yuan and would take more than ten years to repair, were repaired in only 60 days with an investment of 150,000 yuan as a result of mobilizing the masses. It can be seen that the key to the problem is whether you rely on the masses and whether you can mobilize the broad masses.

(IV)
	The success of Foshan City's sanitation work is the result of adhering to the policy of "starting from production, combining with production, and serving production." In 1958, the total industrial output value of Foshan City increased by 61% compared with 1957; in 1959, it increased by 39% compared with 1958. Since 1960, in just two months, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has been increased from 39% to 73%, and the first quarter production plan has been completed 18 days ahead of schedule. Facts have proved that the places where sanitation is done well are also the places where production is done well. The leap forward in sanitation work will inevitably better promote the leap forward in production. The two are mutually reinforcing.

	However, this policy was not understood by the majority of cadres at the beginning of the sanitation movement, especially many industrial cadres had some ideological resistance. They believed that "doing sanitation conflicts with doing production," which would "affect production," and even believed that "it is easy for the neighborhoods to do it, but it is difficult for factories to do it." In response to these ideas, the Foshan Municipal Party Committee launched a debate at certain meetings, and then proved with facts through the sanitary pilot work in factories and the catering industry that, as long as it is arranged properly, eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene can directly serve production. For example, after the silk weaving factory changed the sanitary environment of the workshop, the situation that silk was often stained was greatly changed, and the first-class products in the products were significantly improved. Of course, more importantly, people's physical fitness has been enhanced and diseases have been reduced, thereby continuously improving labor productivity. For example, after doing a good job in sanitation, the employee absenteeism rate due to illness at the Gongjilong Silk Weaving Factory decreased year by year, and decreased by 31% in 1959 compared with 1958. After doing a good job in sanitation, the incidence rate of employees at the Foshan Water Pump Factory in 1959 decreased by half compared with 1958, and production increased significantly. These are clear proofs.

	Foshan City's practice of combining sanitation work with urban construction work is also relatively good. The first is that the Municipal Party Committee leaders have a visionary thinking on municipal construction. They have achieved the combination of municipal construction to carry out large-scale sanitation infrastructure construction. For example, eradicating sewers, repairing roads, and renovating toilets have not only created a good sanitary environment, but also greatly accelerated the change of the city's appearance. And all of this will inevitably, in turn, powerfully promote the change of the face of production. This practice of combining sanitation work and municipal construction work is completely conducive to the fundamental transformation of old cities.

	Of course, there are still shortcomings and problems in Foshan City's sanitation work at present. For example, drinking water sanitation, the treatment of upper water pipes; suburban sanitation, the harmless treatment of feces; the thorough eradication of breeding grounds for "four pests"; the lighting and ventilation of old houses and factories have not been well resolved, and some work has not even been involved. Therefore, Foshan City still has a lot of work to do in sanitation in the future, and other cities and rural areas in Guangdong Province should work harder to catch up. We must learn from the advanced experience of sanitation work in other places with an open mind in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, so as to make greater achievements in sanitation in the next three years from 1960, 1961, and 1962.

    佛山市怎样搞好了卫生工作
    中共广东省委书记处书记　区梦觉
    （一）
    佛山市是广东省的一个中等城市。在解放前，它的市政建设以及卫生条件都是很差的。解放后，特别是1958年大跃进以来，经过大搞群众运动，佛山市的工农业生产有了很大的跃进，卫生工作，也取得了很大成绩。无论是从全市生产环境和居住环境的改善，全市人民普遍养成良好的卫生习惯，以及全市人民体质的增强，进一步提高劳动效率，促进生产等方面，都可以看得出来。它现在是广东省的卫生红旗市。
    佛山市卫生工作的特点，主要表现在如下几个方面：首先是全党动员，全民动手。它不是哪一个部门搞，哪一部分人搞，而是每一个部门都参加进去，每一个人都动作起来。其次是工作的坚持性，工作的韧性。自从1958年大搞卫生运动以来，不但做到轰轰烈烈，声势浩大，而且做到经常与突击相结合，使运动不间断地发展下去。再其次就是能做到从生产出发，结合生产，为生产服务。两年来，佛山市不但卫生工作搞得好，工业生产也搞得比较好。
    像佛山过去这样一个古老破烂，卫生条件极其不好的旧城市，经过了全市人民两年来的努力，现在从根本上改变了城市环境的卫生面貌，这给我们以很大的启发。佛山市能够办到的事，别的城市也可以办到。问题是：事在人为。只要人人动起手来，就一定可以把卫生工作做好。佛山市卫生工作中总结出来的经验，可供目前各个城市开展卫生工作借鉴。现在我谈谈对佛山市卫生工作的几点体会。（二）
    佛山市卫生工作能够搞好，其首要的关键是加强党的领导。佛山市卫生工作一直是在佛山市委的直接领导下进行的。一些卫生工作中带关键性的问题，都是经过市委研究决定的。佛山市过去卫生工作条件很差，而真正要搞起来，又碰到不少客观上存在着的困难，如根治下水道，就存在着技术、经费、劳动力、原料材料等方面的困难。在这样情况下，是用“改良主义”的态度，治一治标的办法来领导卫生工作，还是以革命气魄来领导卫生工作，这就是决定卫生工作能否搞好的首要关键。佛山市委采取了后一种态度。他们估计到所有的困难条件，但更多是估计到人的主观能动性。他们认识到佛山市人民生活水平不断提高，对改善生产环境与居住环境有着强烈的要求和愿望，这就是最有利的条件。因此，他们没有在困难面前低头，而是在1958年提出：要在三年时间内，把佛山从手工业城市改变为现代工业城市，从破烂肮脏的城市变为整洁美丽的城市，从封建迷信的城市变为有民族传统的文化艺术的城市。事实证明，由于市委的决心很大，革命干劲十足，所以群众很快就发动起来了。
    佛山市委把群众发动起来，工作上取得一定成绩后，并没有自满、松劲，停顿下来，他们总是用不断革命的精神来指导市的卫生运动。佛山市的卫生运动，能够一个高潮接着一个高潮的向前发展，不断取得成绩，原因也在这里。佛山市委总是能够根据运动的发展，充分研究情况，抓住每个时期带关键性的问题，提出响亮的口号，来发动群众，调动群众的积极性。由于这些口号是市委研究了情况，根据每个时期的当务之急提出的，所以群众一旦理解到这一口号的正确性，这一口号和他们的迫切需要解决的问题相吻合的时候，就接受任务，勇往直前，任何困难也抵挡不住他们的前进。佛山市委曾先后提出：“臭沟变清河”、
  “根治下水道”、“路面水泥化”、“家家户户争取做卫生之家”、“大搞卫生模范街”等口号。这些口号经过群众的努力，都变成了现实，使佛山市的卫生运动，能够接连不断地解决了卫生工作中一系列带根本性的问题。
    佛山市委对卫生工作的领导，还表现在对卫生工作与其他工作的统一领导，全面安排，以及对卫生工作的分头贯彻，层层包干方面。他们在卫生工作与生产以及中心工作等关系的安排上，实行了“四统一”、“四到底”。“四统一”是：统一思想，统一规划，统一安排，统一领导。“四到底”，则是在各战线、各部门实行党委领导到底；组织机构和人员配备到底；专人专责，战线包干和部门结合到底。佛山市的党组织从市委开始，对于卫生工作都是由第一书记挂帅，并有专人专责。市委还把卫生工作放到市委常委的议事日程上，定期作专门讨论，根据新的情况，做出新的决定。在各部门之间，则是在布置各部门工作的同时，也布置卫生工作，把卫生工作列为部门的经常业务之一，而不是可有可无，随时可增添、可删去的一项工作。此外，佛山市的爱国卫生运动委员会的组织也是比较健全的。市委、市人委由一个书记、一个副市长来领导，各战线、各部门还分别成立了分会或小组。由于统一领导，全面安排，这就把各条战线、各个部门都动员起来，也把各项工作都结合起来。由于有了专门组织以及专人负责，这就使集体领导和专门负责结合起来，对于卫生的领导就健全而且坚强了。
    当然，党对卫生工作的领导，决不止于这几个方面。但是，从佛山市的经验当中，使我们体会到：要真正搞好卫生工作，党的领导决不能只停留在开一开动员大会，做一做一般号召上面。事实证明：哪里的党委对于卫生工作只是停留在一般号召上，哪里的卫生工作就不会有什么起色。（三）
    佛山市卫生工作的成就还在于在卫生工作中贯彻执行了群众路线和大搞群众运动。
    不错，佛山市人民对病害的深恶痛绝与要求整洁的居住、生产环境的强烈愿望，是佛山市在卫生工作中大搞群众运动的最有利、也是最根本的条件。但这并不等于说，任何工作都不需要做了，一纸命令就可以把群众发动起来了。事实上，运动刚一开始的时候，群众也是有着各色各样的思想的。譬如，其中有人对改变古城面貌、搞好卫生工作要付出艰苦劳动，思想准备还不足，还不够自觉；有极少数人还存在着坐享其成的思想；而更带普遍性的思想则是“佛山落后论”。他们认为：佛山又古老、又破烂、又肮脏，条件很差，短期内难以改变面貌。能不能很好地把群众发动起来，能不能引导、启发大家自觉地投入到卫生运动中来，是摆在佛山市委面前的第一个要解决的问题。佛山市委一方面开展了一个“搞好卫生，消灭四害，对我们有什么好处”的鸣放辩论，同时又运用各种各样的宣传工具，进行了生动有力的宣传，真正做到从思想上把群众发动起来。
    佛山市委在发动群众、动员群众的时候，并不仅仅停留在一般的宣传动员工作上，而是在初步解决了群众的思想问题之后，再通过典型示范，用事实再一次说服教育群众，然后才由点到面地普遍推广。佛山市在根治下水道的时候，在工厂中，饮食行业中搞卫生的时候，以及以后推广“卫生之家”、“卫生模范街”的时候，都是选择一些条件最差的地方，先把它搞好，再带大家去参观。等到大家的思想障碍扫除了，才作普遍的铺开。当运动全面开展起来以后，他们就进一步通过大竞赛、大评比，表扬先进，推动运动更全面地发展。佛山市委在发动群众时，还注意到抓落后，抓死角。当运动发展到一定阶段时，各级党组织的领导人员，深入检查落后单位，落后地区，然后选择有代表性的单位或人家，召开落后单位的现场会议。这种会议，不单单是批评落后单位，而且更重要的是帮助它们分析落后的原因，指出它应该从哪些方面改进。像这样的会议，不但教育了落后单位，而且推动了全面，使卫生运动由不平衡趋于平衡，得到发展与提高，大大促进了卫生运动更广泛更深入地开展。
    佛山市的卫生工作，再一次证明了：只要人人动作起来，充分发挥主观能动性，就没有什么不可克服的困难。而有一些看起来非要很多钱，非用“洋”办法才能解决的问题，实际上却不要花多少钱，用“土”办法就可以完全解决。这也是佛山市卫生工作很大的一个特色。根治下水道，就是这一特色的集中、突出的表现。根据建设部门最节约的计算，本来需要国家投资二百多万元，需时十几年才能修好的下水道，由于发动了群众，结果只用款十五万元，费时六十天就把它修好了。可见问题的关键就是看你是不是依靠群众，能不能把广大群众发动起来。
    （四）
    佛山市的卫生工作搞得好，是坚持“从生产出发，结合生产，为生产服务”的方针的结果。1958年佛山市工业生产总值比1957年增长61％；1959年又比1958年增长了39％。1960年以来，仅仅两个月的时间，就把机械化半机械化程度从39％提高到73％，并提前十八天完成了第一季度生产计划。事实证明，搞好卫生的地方，也正是搞好生产的地方，卫生工作的跃进，必然更好地促进了生产的跃进。两者是相辅相成的。
    但是，这一方针在卫生运动刚开始的时候，并未为广大干部所了解，尤其是有不少工业干部思想上有所抵触。他们认为“搞卫生与搞生产有矛盾”，会“影响生产”，甚至认为“街坊好搞，工厂难搞”。佛山市委针对这些思想，在一定的会议上展开了辩论，然后又通过工厂、饮食业的卫生试点工作，用事实证明了，只要安排得当，除四害、讲卫生是能够直接为生产服务的。如丝织厂，改变了车间卫生环境后，丝绸经常被染污的情况大为改变，产品中的一等品显著提高。当然，更重要的是人的体质增强了，疾病减少了，从而使劳动生产率不断提高。例如公记隆丝织厂，搞好卫生后，职工的因病缺勤率逐年下降，1959年比1958年下降了31％。佛山水泵厂搞好卫生工作后，1959年职工发病率比1958年下降了一半，生产显著上升，这些都是明证。
    佛山市卫生工作与城市建设工作结合起来的做法也是比较好的。这首先就是市委领导上对市政建设有着一种高瞻远瞩的思想。他们做到了结合市政建设来大搞卫生基本建设。例如根治下水道，修整道路，改建厕所等，就是既创造了良好的卫生环境，又大大加快了城市面貌的改变。而所有这一切，又势必反过来有力地促进生产面貌的改变。这种把卫生工作和市政建设工作结合进行的做法，是完全有利于旧城市的根本改造的。
    自然，佛山市的卫生工作，目前还存在着缺点和问题。譬如饮用水卫生，上水道的处理问题；郊区卫生，粪便无害化处理问题，“四害”孳生地的彻底根治问题；古老住宅以及工厂内的采光通风等问题，都尚未很好解决，有些工作甚至还未涉及。因此，佛山市的卫生工作，今后仍然有很多工作要做，广东省其它城市以及农村里的卫生工作就更应该努力迎头赶上去。我们一定要根据党中央和毛主席的指示，虚心学习其它地方卫生工作的先进经验，以便在1960年、1961年、1962年这三年时间内，在卫生工作方面做出更大的成绩来。
