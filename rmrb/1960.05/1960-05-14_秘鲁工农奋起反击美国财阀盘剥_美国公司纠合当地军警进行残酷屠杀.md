    Peruvian Workers and Peasants Rise Up to Resist Exploitation by American Financial Groups
    American Companies Collude with Local Military Police in a Brutal Massacre
    (Comprehensive report by this newspaper) According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Lima: The strike of thousands of sugarcane plantation workers at the Paramonga sugar estate, operated by the American Grace Company in Peru, against the American capitalists' has entered its twenty-fifth day on the 8th. This strike is to oppose the American company authorities' specially setting up clocks to control time and intensify the exploitation of workers.
    The Cartavio sugar estate's union announced a seventy-two-hour strike, and the sugar workers' federation also decided to hold a general strike to support the workers of the Paramonga sugar estate. Striking workers clashed with Peruvian military police twice on the 7th, resulting in six workers being killed and seventeen injured.
    Peruvian workers have decided to hold a national general strike to support the workers and peasants who were recently massacred for resisting the American Cerro de Pasco Copper Corporation's land seizure and the intensified exploitation by the Paramonga sugar estate.
    The United Labor Union—the Peruvian Workers' Confederation, composed of workers, staff, and peasants—held a meeting and unanimously decided to hold a twenty-four-hour general strike nationwide on the 13th. The Peruvian Peasants' Federation also issued a statement expressing support for the laborers of the Paramonga sugar estate, demanding land reform, and supporting the resolutions of the Workers' Confederation. The United Confederation of Private Employees, in a statement issued to the press, condemned the American companies for colluding with local military police to massacre peasants and demanded that those responsible be punished.
    On May 2, peasants at the Pária farm, belonging to the Cerro de Pasco Copper Corporation, established by the American financial magnate Morgan, were massacred by the company authorities and military police for resisting the company authorities' land-grabbing atrocities, resulting in four deaths and dozens of injuries.

    美国公司纠合当地军警进行残酷屠杀
    本报综合报道　据新华社利马电：美国格雷斯公司在秘鲁经营的帕拉蒙加糖业庄园的数千名甘蔗种植工人反对美国资本家的罢工斗争在8日已经进入第二十五天。这次罢工是为了反对美国公司当局专门设置控制时间的钟表以加强剥削工人。
    卡尔塔比奥糖业庄园的工会宣布举行七十二小时的罢工，糖业工人联合会也决定举行总罢工，声援帕拉蒙加糖业庄园的工人。罢工工人7日同秘鲁军警两次发生冲突，有六名工人被打死，十七人受伤。
    秘鲁工人决定举行全国总罢工，以支持最近因反抗美国塞罗德帕斯科铜公司的夺地行为和帕拉蒙加糖业庄园的加强剥削而惨遭屠杀的工人和农民。
    由工人、职员及农民组成的统一工会——秘鲁工人联合会举行会议，一致决定于13日在全国举行二十四小时总罢工。秘鲁农民联合会也发表声明，表示支持帕拉蒙加糖业庄园的劳动者，要求进行土地改革和支持工人联合会的决议。私人职员统一工会在向报界发表的声明中谴责美国公司纠合当地军警对农民进行屠杀，并且要求惩办负责者。
    由美国大财阀摩根建立的塞罗德帕斯科铜公司所属的帕里亚农场的农民5月2日因反抗公司当局的夺地暴行而遭到公司当局和军警的屠杀，有四人死亡，数十人受伤。
