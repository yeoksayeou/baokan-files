Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 18th (TASS): The Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman's accompanying reporter group reports: As agreed upon at the end of the preliminary meeting of the four heads of state in Paris, and according to the suggestion of President de Gaulle, chairman of the meeting, May 17th should be the day to consider the statements of the heads of government.

	Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev and Soviet Marshal Malinovsky took this opportunity to visit the town of Plessis-sur-Marne, more than 120 kilometers from Paris.

	While Khrushchev and Malinovsky were chatting cordially with the farmers in Plessis-sur-Marne, reminiscing about the years of common struggle in the past, news came from Paris through the police and reporters: a meeting of the four heads of government was scheduled to be held at the Élysée Palace at three o'clock.

	After Khrushchev returned to Paris, he received a letter from President de Gaulle, reiterating his intention to hold such a meeting. However, the letter did not clearly indicate whether he was referring to a second preliminary meeting to be held at the end of the consideration day, or an attempt to unilaterally convene a top-level meeting.

	Khrushchev asked the French side to specify the nature of the meeting to be convened, and this request was conveyed by telephone.

	But no answer was received. At that time, the heads of the three Western powers arrived at the Élysée Palace. Without receiving a reply, Khrushchev wrote the following letter to President de Gaulle: "Mr. President, there is an ambiguity in your letter to me of May 17 this year:

	Your letter does not mention at all whether you are referring to a preliminary meeting of the heads of state of France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States to determine whether conditions exist for the formation of a top-level meeting, or whether you are referring to the top-level meeting itself.

	I said yesterday that if the U.S. government removes the obstacles preventing me from attending such a meeting, then I, as the head of the Soviet government, am willing to attend the top-level meeting. Such obstacles would be removed if President Eisenhower declared that the U.S. government condemned the provocative actions of U.S. aircraft against the Soviet Union, expressed regret for such actions, took measures to punish the perpetrators, and guaranteed that such actions would not be taken against the Soviet Union in the future.

	It goes without saying that, as has already been notified to the head of your office, I am prepared to attend a meeting if such a meeting is of a preliminary nature."

	Only after the unilateral meeting of the heads of the three Western powers at the Élysée Palace did President de Gaulle reply to Khrushchev's letter, saying:

	"My clear answer to the question you raised in your letter is that the purpose of this meeting is to begin discussing the issues we have agreed to discuss at the top-level meeting, and therefore, it should be of the nature of the first meeting of the top-level meeting."

	This statement cannot help but be surprising, because everyone knows that Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev, in his statement at the preliminary meeting, had already stated very clearly the conditions under which the Soviet government was prepared to participate in the top-level meeting.

	In view of the fact that President Eisenhower did not issue a public statement after the preliminary meeting condemning the provocative actions of U.S. aircraft against the Soviet Union, did not declare that he would punish the perpetrators, and would not in the future carry out such provocative actions against the Soviet Union, it is quite obvious that in these circumstances there could be no question of holding a top-level meeting on May 17.

	The intention of this unilateral action by the Western countries can also be clearly seen from the statement made by U.S. President's Press Secretary Hagerty at a press conference on the evening of May 17, in which he actually said that the top-level meeting should have started on this day, but it failed to take place due to the absence of the Soviet representative, and that President Eisenhower believed that the top-level meeting was over.

	However, no matter what diplomatic tricks the U.S. government uses to deceive public opinion, it will ultimately not escape responsibility for sabotaging the top-level meeting.

	As everyone knows, it was precisely the U.S. government that, with its aggressive actions against the Soviet Union on the eve of the top-level meeting and its stubborn refusal to take responsibility for these actions, destroyed the top-level meeting that the people of the world had placed their hopes on.

	The Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman's accompanying reporter group is authorized to declare that, in order to confirm its firm will for peace and for resolving international disputes through negotiations, the Soviet government once again declares that if the United States removes the obstacles to convening this meeting caused by its own sins, the Soviet Union is still willing to sit down at the table of the top-level meeting.

    苏联部长会议主席随行记者组报道
    尽管美国玩弄外交手腕迷惑舆论
    终究逃不脱破坏四国会议的责任
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社巴黎17日讯：苏联部长会议主席随行记者组报道：正如四大国首脑在巴黎举行的预备会议结束时约定的，根据这次会议的主席戴高乐总统的建议，5月17日应作为对政府首脑的声明进行考虑的日子。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和苏联元帅马利诺夫斯基利用这个机会到距巴黎一百二十多公里的普勒—休尔—马恩镇进行了游览。
    当赫鲁晓夫和马利诺夫斯基在普勒—休尔—马恩镇和农民们亲切地交谈，回忆过去共同斗争的年月时，从巴黎通过警察和记者传来了一则消息：拟定在三点钟在爱丽舍宫举行四国政府首脑会议。
    赫鲁晓夫回到巴黎后，收到戴高乐总统一封信，信中重申了他要举行这种会议的意图。但是，信中没有清楚表明，他所指的是考虑日结束时再次举行的预备会议，还是试图单方面召开最高级会议。
    赫鲁晓夫请法国方面指明要召开的会议的性质，这项请求通过电话转达过去。
    但是没有接到回答。届时西方三国首脑来到了爱丽舍宫。赫鲁晓夫没有接到答复就给戴高乐总统写了如下的信：总统先生，在您今年5月17日给我的信中有下面这样一个不明确的地方：
    您的信中丝毫没有谈到，您所指的是法、苏、英、美四国首脑举行预备会议，来确定是否存在使最高级会议开成的条件，还是指的就是开最高级会议。
    我昨天已经说过，如果美国政府消除阻碍我参加这种会议的障碍，那么我作为苏联政府的首脑愿意参加最高级会议。如果艾森豪威尔总统声明，美国政府谴责美国飞机对苏联进行的挑衅行动，对这种行动表示遗憾，采取措施惩处罪犯并保证今后不再对苏联进行这种行动，那么这种障碍就会消除。
    不言而喻，正如已经通知您的办公厅负责人的，我准备参加会见，如果这种会见将具有预备性质。”
    西方三国首脑在爱丽舍宫举行的单方面会议结束以后，戴高乐总统才对赫鲁晓夫的信作了答复，信中说：
    “我对您在信中指出的问题的明确答复是，这个会议的目的是开始讨论我们已经同意在最高级会议上讨论的问题，因此，它应具有最高级会议的第一次会议的性质。”
    这个声明不能不使人感到惊奇，因为大家都知道，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在预备会议上的声明中，已经十分明确地陈述了苏联政府准备参加最高级会议的条件。
    鉴于艾森豪威尔总统在预备会议后没有发表公开声明，谴责美国飞机对苏联的挑衅行动，没有声明惩处罪犯和今后不再对苏联进行这种挑衅行动，这就十分明显，在这种情况下就根本谈不到在5月17日举行最高级会议的问题。
    从美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂5月17日晚间在记者招待会上发表的声明中，也可以清楚地看出西方国家这种单方面行动的意图，他竟说什么这一天应开始举行最高级会议，而由于苏联代表缺席未能举行，并说什么艾森豪威尔总统认为最高级会议已经结束。
    但是，不论美国政府使用什么样的外交手腕来迷惑舆论，它终究逃不出破坏最高级会议的责任。
    大家知道，正是美国政府以它在最高级会议前夕对苏联的侵略行动和顽固地拒绝对这种行动负责的作法，破坏了世界各国人民寄予希望的这次最高级会议。
    苏联部长会议主席随行记者组受权声明，苏联政府为了证实它对和平和通过谈判途径解决国际争端的坚定意志，特再次声明，如果美国消除由于它的罪过而造成的对于召开这次会议的障碍的话，苏联仍然愿意在最高级会议桌旁坐下来。
