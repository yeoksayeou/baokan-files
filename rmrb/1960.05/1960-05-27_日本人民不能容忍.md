The Japanese People Cannot Tolerate This
Commentator of this newspaper

Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Inejiro Asanuma, issued a statement late on May 24th, sternly refuting the arrogant remarks made by the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Douglas MacArthur II, regarding the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people. On the morning of May 24th, Inejiro Asanuma and other leaders of the Japanese Socialist Party went to the U.S. Embassy in Japan to meet with MacArthur II, requesting the cancellation of U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan. When MacArthur received the Socialist Party's request, he not only slammed the table and glared, but also blatantly threatened the Socialist Party with a very rude attitude, holding them responsible for the "chaos" that occurred during the "passage" of the new "Security Treaty" in the Diet. MacArthur even insisted that Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma "retract" his statement made in Beijing that "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Japanese and Chinese people;" and in a subsequent statement, he went to the extreme of slander and attack against the Socialist Party and Asanuma himself, falsely claiming that Asanuma's request to cancel Eisenhower's visit to Japan and his meeting with MacArthur were for "propaganda purposes." Inejiro Asanuma maintained a stern position in the face of intimidation and threats from the U.S. imperialists. Late on the 24th, he once again condemned U.S. imperialism for imposing its military needs on Japan, dividing Korea and Vietnam, and occupying Taiwan and Okinawa. He said that these are the essence of U.S. imperialism. Asanuma also clearly pointed out that MacArthur II's "unprecedented action of issuing a statement on Japanese internal affairs" was "to support the Nobusuke Kishi government." Undoubtedly, Inejiro Asanuma's condemnation of U.S. imperialism will receive the support of the broad masses of the Japanese people.

Through this incident, U.S. Ambassador to Japan, MacArthur II, has once again nakedly exposed his arrogance and conceit in regarding himself as the "Supreme Emperor" of Japan! As a spokesman for the Socialist Party said, he acts like "a governor ruling a dependent state." In fact, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan is the representative of the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and enslavement of the Japanese people. The incidents of U.S. imperialists interfering in Japanese internal affairs and bullying and humiliating the Japanese people are not just this one, but thousands, tens of thousands, countless. From the first U.S. Supreme Commander of the occupying forces in Japan, MacArthur, who once said that "the intelligence of the Japanese is only at the level of a twelve-year-old child," to the current MacArthur II, none of them is not a "Supreme Emperor" riding on the heads of the Japanese people. Japan nominally has its own government, but in fact, whether it is military, political, or economic, it is completely subject to the control of the U.S. "Supreme Emperor," and any major matter is difficult to implement without their approval. Especially the current MacArthur, who is called by Japanese public opinion "the supervisor of the San Francisco Treaty (unilateral peace treaty) system," he has imposed the shackles of enslavement on the heads of the Japanese people. The Japanese people have heard MacArthur more than once promoting that for the "common interests" of Japan and the United States, both sides should have "patience and understanding, and make unswerving sacrifices." However, through MacArthur's actions in Japan for the past three and a half years, and through the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the Japanese people have increasingly clearly seen that MacArthur's so-called "patience and understanding" only requires the Japanese people to have unlimited patience and understanding of the enslavement and oppression of U.S. imperialism; his so-called "unswerving sacrifices" only require the Japanese people to make unlimited sacrifices for the interests of U.S. imperialism. Recently, because the United States colluded with the Japanese reactionaries in their eagerness to "pass" the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and because the United States single-handedly directed the fascist farce of Nobusuke Kishi forcibly "passing" this treaty, it angered the broad masses of the Japanese people and sparked a surge of anger against the Nobusuke Kishi government and demanding the dissolution of the Diet, frightening the Japanese reactionaries. In such circumstances, MacArthur openly took advantage of the opportunity to speak to Asanuma to show his power, intimidate the Japanese people, directly interfere in Japanese internal affairs, and slander the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people. For the patriotic and nationally self-respecting broad masses of the Japanese people, MacArthur's rampant actions are intolerable!

MacArthur has done it too blatantly, so much so that even the U.S. State Department is worried that it will "stimulate Japanese public opinion," so while expressing firm support for MacArthur's actions, it quickly shirked responsibility, saying that "Ambassador MacArthur did not have time to contact Washington before issuing the statement." However, no matter what statement the U.S. State Department makes, it cannot cover up the U.S. imperialist act of insulting the Japanese people through MacArthur's behavior of posing as a "Supreme Emperor," nor can it contain the indignation of the Japanese people, let alone prevent the protests and condemnations from all walks of life in Japan. As the "Akahata" editorial pointed out: The American ambassador's behavior insulted the Japanese people and democratic forces. "Now we must recognize our enemies. All democratic forces should clearly realize that they are fighting against U.S. imperialism." MacArthur, with his arrogant behavior, once again acted as a negative teacher for the Japanese people, enlightening the Japanese people to awaken and launch a more determined struggle.

    日本人民不能容忍
    本报评论员
    日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎在5月24日深夜发表谈话，严正驳斥美国驻日本大使道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟第二对日本人民的爱国正义斗争发出的骄横谈话。浅沼稻次郎和日本社会党的其他领导人，24日上午曾到美国驻日本大使馆去会见麦克阿瑟第二，要求取消美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本的计划。麦克阿瑟在接受社会党的要求书时，不仅拍桌瞪眼、大发雷霆，而且公然以非常蛮横的态度威胁社会党应对在国会“通过”新“安全条约”时发生的“混乱”负责。麦克阿瑟甚至于硬要社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎“收回”他在北京说过的“美帝国主义是日中两国人民的共同敌人”这句话；并在事后发表的声明中对社会党和浅沼本人极尽诬蔑攻击之能事，胡说浅沼要求取消艾森豪威尔访问日本以及他同麦克阿瑟的会面是为了“进行宣传”。浅沼稻次郎在美帝国主义分子的恐吓和威胁面前坚持了严正立场。24日深夜，他再一次谴责美帝国主义把军事需要强加于日本，并且分裂朝鲜和越南，霸占台湾和霸占冲绳。他说，这些就是美帝国主义的实质。浅沼还明确地指出麦克阿瑟第二“就日本内政发表声明的史无前例的行动”是“为了支持岸信介政府”。无疑的，浅沼稻次郎对于美帝国主义的谴责，一定会得到日本广大人民的支持。
    通过这一事件，美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二又一次赤裸裸地暴露了他以日本的“太上皇”自居，何等骄横狂妄！正如社会党一位发言人所说的，活像“统治着一个属国的总督”。实际上，美国驻日本大使，就是美帝国主义侵略和奴役日本人民政策的代表。美帝国主义者对日本内政横加干涉、对日本人民极尽欺凌侮辱的事件绝不是这一件，而是有千件、万件、无数件。从曾经说过“日本人的智慧只有十二岁小孩的程度”的美国第一任驻日本占领军总司令麦克阿瑟直到现在的这个麦克阿瑟第二，没有一个不是骑在日本人民头上的“太上皇”。日本名义上有着自己的政府，但事实上不论是军事、政治或经济却完完全全要受到美国“太上皇”的控制，任何重大事情不经他们批准是难以付诸实现的。特别是眼前的这个麦克阿瑟，被日本舆论称为“旧金山条约（片面和约）体制的监视人”，他把奴役的枷锁强加到日本人民的头上。日本人民不止一次地听到过麦克阿瑟宣扬为了日美两国的“共同利益”，双方都应有“耐心和谅解，并且坚持不渝地作出牺牲。”然而通过麦克阿瑟本人三年半来在日本的所作所为，通过日美军事同盟条约的缔结，日本人民已越来越清楚地看到，麦克阿瑟所谓的“耐心和谅解”，只是要求日本人民对美帝国主义的奴役、压迫作无限度的耐心和谅解；他所谓的“坚持不渝地作出牺牲”，只是要求日本人民为美帝国主义的利益作出无限度的牺牲。最近以来，由于美国勾结日本反动派急于“通过”日美军事同盟条约，由于美国一手导演了岸信介强行“通过”这个条约的法西斯丑剧，激怒了日本广大人民，掀起了反对岸信介政府、要求解散国会的怒潮，吓坏了日本反动派。麦克阿瑟在这样的情况下，竟公然借着对浅沼谈话的机会，大发淫威，对日本人民进行恫吓，直接出面干涉日本内政，诬蔑日本人民的爱国正义斗争。麦克阿瑟的这一猖狂举动，对于爱国的和富有民族自尊心的广大日本人民来说，是可忍孰不可忍？
    麦克阿瑟做得未免太露骨了，以致连美国国务院都担心会“刺激日本舆论”，所以在它表示坚决支持麦克阿瑟的行动的同时，又赶紧推卸责任，说什么“麦克阿瑟大使没有来得及和华盛顿联系就发出了声明”。然而，不管美国国务院作出什么样的声明，也掩盖不了美帝国主义通过麦克阿瑟这种俨然以“太上皇”自居的侮辱日本人民的行径，也无法遏止日本人民的义愤，更不能不引起日本各界的抗议和谴责。正像“赤旗报”社论所指出的：美国大使这种行为侮辱了日本人民和民主力量。“现在我们必须认清我们的敌人。所有的民主力量应当清楚地意识到，他们是在同美帝国主义进行斗争”。麦克阿瑟以自己的骄横行为，又一次充当了日本人民的反面教员，启发日本人民觉悟起来，兴起更加坚决的斗争。
