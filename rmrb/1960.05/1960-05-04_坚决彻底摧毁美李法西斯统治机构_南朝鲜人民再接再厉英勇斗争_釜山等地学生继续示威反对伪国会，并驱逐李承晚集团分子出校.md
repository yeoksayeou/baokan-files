    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd: Seoul dispatch: The struggle of the South Korean people to completely abolish the fascist ruling institutions of the Syngman Rhee group is continuing to develop.
    According to South Korea's Tonghwa News Agency, a large demonstration of more than 20,000 people broke out again in Busan at 9:00 AM today, demanding the immediate dissolution of the puppet National Assembly. Today's demonstration was held by students from nine middle schools in Busan. The city's "Garrison Commander" immediately dispatched four armored vehicles and a company of military police to obstruct the demonstration. But by around 12:30 PM, more and more people were participating in the demonstration.
    In Seoul today, 150 students from Dankook University held a sit-in demonstration in front of the puppet "National Assembly" building, demanding the immediate dissolution of the corrupt National Assembly. The "Garrison Command" dispatched troops and used tear gas to suppress the demonstrating masses.
    According to Tonghwa News Agency, 700 students in Daegu City also held a demonstration at 11:30 AM today. They shouted "Dissolve Syngman Rhee's National Assembly!".
    In Iri, student demonstrations demanding the dissolution of the National Assembly have continued for two days. Yesterday, they repelled the armed police who were suppressing them. They not only expressed opposition to the Liberal Party "National Assembly" members, but also destroyed the Democratic Party's city headquarters today.
    According to reports, in Gimhae, west of Busan, thousands of students also held a demonstration at 10:00 AM this morning demanding the dissolution of the puppet "National Assembly."
    According to reports, in Pohang, students also held demonstrations against the puppet National Assembly.
    At the same time, students in various schools in Busan have also launched a strike to expel members of the Syngman Rhee group from the schools.
    According to Hapdong News Agency, all 1,400 students of Busan Kyungnam Commercial High School went on strike at 10:00 AM today, demanding that the school's principal, supervisor, and head of academic affairs get out of the school. According to Tonghwa News Agency, all 1,600 students of Busan Kyungnam High School have been on strike since the 2nd. They want the principal and supervisor to get out immediately. The students said they would continue the strike until their demands are met. The students who held demonstrations in Busan, Daegu and other places today also shouted slogans such as "Fake teachers get out!" Under the pressure of the people, the South Korean puppet "National Assembly" officially accepted Syngman Rhee's resignation today.
    Now, the South Korean "National Assembly," which is still controlled by Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party, is trying to deceive the people under the direction of the United States by modifying the current "Constitution" to organize a new puppet regime and maintain the colonial system of US imperialism.
    At the same time, the "Garrison Command," headed by Song Yo-chan, the puppet army's Chief of Staff, under the direct manipulation of the US imperialists, is frantically intensifying the suppression of the South Korean people.

    坚决彻底摧毁美李法西斯统治机构
    南朝鲜人民再接再厉英勇斗争
    釜山等地学生继续示威反对伪国会，并驱逐李承晚集团分子出校
    据新华社平壤3日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜人民为彻底废除李承晚集团法西斯统治机构的斗争正在继续发展。
    据南朝鲜同和通讯社报道，釜山市今天上午九时又爆发了两万多人的大示威，要求立即解散伪国会。今天的示威是由釜山市九个中等学校的学生举行的。这个城市的“戒严司令”立即派出四辆装甲车和一连宪兵阻挠示威。但是到十二时半左右，参加示威的人越来越多。
    汉城市今天有檀国大学学生一百五十人在伪“国会”议事堂前举行静坐示威，他们要求立即解散腐败的国会。“戒严司令部”出动了军队，用催泪弹镇压示威群众。
    据同和通讯社报道，大丘市的七百名学生今天上午十一时半，也举行示威。他们高呼“解散李承晚的国会！”。
    在里里市，学生要求解散国会的示威已经继续了两天。昨天他们击退了镇压他们的武装警察，他们不但表示反对自由党“国会”议员，并且在今天捣毁了民主党的市党部。
    据报道，在釜山西面的金海，今天上午十时也有数千名学生举行了要求伪“国会”解散的示威。
    据报道，在浦项，学生也举行了反对伪国会的示威。
    同时，釜山各校学生还展开罢课斗争，驱逐李承晚集团分子出校。
    据合同通讯社报道，釜山庆南商业高等学校全体学生一千四百多名今天上午十时罢课，要这个学校的校长、校监和教务主任滚出学校去。另据同和通讯社报道，釜山庆南高等学校全校一千六百多名学生从2日开始罢课。他们要校长和校监立即滚出去。学生们表示，要继续罢课，直到达到他们的要求为止。今天釜山、大丘等地举行示威的学生也都高呼“冒牌的教师滚出去”等口号。在人民的压力下，南朝鲜伪“国会”今天正式接受了李承晚的辞职。
    现在，仍然被李承晚的自由党控制的南朝鲜“国会”正在美国导演下用修改现行“宪法”的手法来欺骗人民，组织新的傀儡政权，维持美帝国主义的殖民制度。
    和这同时，在美帝国主义者直接操纵下的以伪军陆军参谋总长宋尧赞为头目的“戒严司令部”正疯狂地加紧对南朝鲜人民进行镇压。
