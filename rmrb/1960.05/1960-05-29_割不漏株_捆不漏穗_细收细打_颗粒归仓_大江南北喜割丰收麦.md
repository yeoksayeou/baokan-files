(Our newspaper, Wuhan, 28th dispatch) The prelude to Hubei Province's large-scale summer harvest battle has already begun. As of the 22nd, the province had basically finished harvesting barley, and had also harvested over 3.36 million mu of wheat. From the very beginning of the harvest rush, various localities have paid close attention to the work of fine harvesting and careful threshing, striving to achieve high yields and bumper harvests, and returning every grain to the granary.

This year, Hubei Province's summer harvest area is larger than last year, and the crops are generally growing well, basically achieving large-area balanced yield increases. From the hilly areas of eastern Hubei to the mountainous areas of western Hubei, from the Jianghan Plain to the northern Hubei highlands, everywhere there are waves of wheat, golden and dazzling, and the broad masses of commune members are full of joy, with cheers shaking the sky. In order to ensure that the abundant grain is harvested, all localities emphasized fine harvesting and careful threshing, and returning every grain to the granary, as soon as the harvest began. Many areas put forward the slogan of "Harvest every stalk, bundle every ear, pick up every firm bundle, and do not lose a grain in threshing." According to meteorological forecasts, the climate in the Hubei region during the summer harvest this year is extremely unstable, with sunny days alternating with cloudy and rainy days, and there will be more cloudy and rainy days. How to avoid the rain, seize the sunny days, harvest quickly, and ensure that there are no losses based on climate change is an important part of doing a good job in fine harvesting and careful threshing. Recently, various localities have adopted many measures based on past experience. The most important of these is to make all preparations in advance for reaping, bundling, transporting, stacking, threshing, drying, and loading, so as to seize two or three sunny days and complete the harvest in a concentrated rush.

In order to ensure that every grain returns to the granary, many areas have also formulated a set of fine harvesting and careful threshing methods, such as establishing a responsibility system for fixed fields, time, quality, and work points, vigorously reforming tools, and establishing Young Pioneer gleaning teams and elderly women gleaning teams.

(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 28th dispatch) Jiangsu Province's barley and yuan wheat have basically been harvested and stored, achieving the first victory in the summer harvest battle. At present, various localities are taking advantage of the good weather to intensify threshing, so that all the grain that has been brought in is fully harvested.

This year, Jiangsu's barley and yuan wheat, due to the adoption of a series of revolutionary measures from planting to harvesting, and the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, have grown better than in previous years over large areas, whether in Suzhou, Nantong and other places along both banks of the Yangtze River, or in the Xuhuai area on the North Jiangsu Plain. Generally, the wheat grains are plentiful and full, and maturity has also come earlier.

The harvest progress of barley and yuan wheat in various localities is very fast. Generally, it only takes about five days for most areas to complete the harvest, which is five to ten days faster than in previous years. Such a fast harvest speed is the result of the attention paid by Party committees at all levels and the proper arrangement of labor. As early as when barley and yuan wheat were turning yellow and ripening, people's communes universally adopted methods such as one reform (reforming tools), two squeezing (squeezing out labor from all walks of life), three arrangements (unified arrangement), and four management (unified management) to concentrate more than 80% of the labor force on the summer harvest front, greatly enhancing the harvesting strength.

In order to speed up the harvest progress and ensure the harvest quality, the people's communes and production teams have organized the labor force invested in the summer harvest into specialized teams for harvesting, transportation, threshing, and gleaning. Taicang, Changshu, Jiangyin and other counties divided the summer harvest team into two groups to achieve simultaneous harvesting and rushing of the harvest. Before the heavy rain a few days ago, all the cut wheat had been rushed to the threshing ground.

(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 28th dispatch) Winter wheat in Jiangxi Province has generally had a bumper harvest. At present, various localities in the province have organized a labor force of 500,000 to rush the harvest. As of May 26th, over 70% of the total area of wheat has been rushed to the threshing ground, and is being rapidly dried, threshed, and put into storage to ensure that every grain returns to the granary.

Large-area balanced high yield is the prominent feature of Jiangxi's wheat harvest this year. Throughout the province, whether in plains or mountainous areas, whether in cultivated or barren land, whether in historically high-yield areas or low-yield mountainous areas, a bumper wheat harvest has been achieved. Shangyou County, a mountainous area in southern Jiangxi that had never grown wheat in the past, planted more than 10,000 mu of wheat last winter, which has now been harvested. The yield is not low, dispelling the past argument that "wheat cannot be grown in the mountainous areas of southern Jiangxi."

In order to harvest and thresh the bumper wheat in a timely manner, various localities have adopted a series of rush harvest measures. Harvesting professional teams have been organized to line up the wheat by plots, harvesting the ripe ones first, and rushing to harvest as soon as they ripen. Many areas have taken measures to make the wheat harvest work, from harvesting, transporting, and stacking to turning over and drying, and putting it into storage, all done in one go, greatly accelerating the progress. The secretaries and cadres of Party committees at all levels personally go deep into the fields to participate in the rush harvest and lead the rush harvest, which further encourages the enthusiasm of commune members for rushing to harvest wheat.

(Our newspaper, Shanghai, 28th dispatch) The rural areas of Shanghai's suburban counties have begun the summer harvest. Yuan wheat in all eleven counties has been completely harvested, and over 70% of the barley has been harvested. This year, the area of yuan wheat and barley planted in the suburbs has expanded by about 400,000 mu compared to last year. In the past six months, in order to win a bumper wheat harvest, the people's communes have conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and waged arduous struggles against various natural disasters such as severe cold, wind, rain, and pests and diseases. Therefore, the wheat is growing well, with large ears and many grains, and strong stems, generally surpassing previous years. From the situation of already harvested and threshed wheat, both experimental fields, high-yield plots, high-yield areas, and low-yield areas have all reported bumper harvests this year.

In order to ensure a bumper harvest, all localities are conscientiously harvesting a plot when it ripens, harvesting and storing a plot when it is harvested, harvesting, transporting, and gleaning simultaneously, ensuring that every grain returns to the granary. The communes strive for "four light" (light harvesting, light bundling, light carrying, light placing) and "five clean" (clean in the fields, clean on the roads, clean on the boats, clean on the threshing grounds, clean on the firewood) during the harvest. The Second Production Team of the Jiangkou Commune in Chongming County organized a Grain Protection Merit Team, specializing in gleaning wheat ears to ensure that every ear of wheat is harvested. The Heping Production Team of the Xingang Commune in Nanhui County also organized elementary school students to glean wheat ears in their spare time. (Attached picture)

    割不漏株　捆不漏穗　细收细打　颗粒归仓
    大江南北喜割丰收麦
    湖北突击收割力争丰产丰收　江苏大麦元麦基本割完登场
    江西冬小麦大面积平衡高产　上海市郊区边收边运边拾穗
    本报武汉28日电　湖北省大规模夏收战役的序幕已经揭开。到22日止，全省大麦已基本割完，小麦也已收割三百三十六万多亩。各地在抢收战役一开始就十分注意细收细打的工作，力争做到丰产丰收，颗粒归仓。
    湖北省今年夏收面积比去年扩大，而且普遍生长得好，基本上做到了大面积平衡增产。从鄂东丘陵地区到鄂西山区，从江汉平原到鄂北岗地，到处是麦浪滔滔，金光耀眼，广大社员喜气洋洋，欢声震天。为了使丰产的粮食丰收到手，各地一开镰收割时就强调了细收细打，颗粒归仓。许多地区提出了“割不漏株，捆不漏穗，挑不散捆，打不丢粒”的口号。据气象预报，今年湖北地区夏收期间气候极不稳定，晴天和阴、雨天交错相间，而且阴、雨天较多。如何根据气候变化，躲过雨天，抢住晴天，快收快割，保证不受损失，是作好细收细打的一项重要内容。最近，各地根据以往的经验，采取了许多措施。其中最主要的是：事先作好割、捆、运、堆、打、晒、装等方面的一切准备工作，以便抢住两、三个晴天，突击收割完毕。
    为做到颗粒归仓，许多地区还订出了一套细收细打的办法，如建立定田亩、时间、质量、工分的责任制，大力改革工具，以及建立少先拾麦队和婆婆拾麦队组织等。
    本报南京28日电　江苏省的大麦、元麦已基本收割登场，取得了夏收战役的首战胜利。目前，各地正趁大好晴天加紧进行脱粒，使登场的粮食全部丰收到手。
    今年江苏各地的大麦、元麦，由于从种到收采取了一系列的革命性措施，全面贯彻了“八字宪法”，因而，无论是沿长江两岸的苏州、南通等地，还是淮北平原上的徐淮地区，大面积长势都比往年好，一般都是麦粒多又饱，成熟也提早。
    各地大麦、元麦的收获进度都很快，一般地区只在五天左右就基本收割结束，比往年加快了五天到十天。这样快的收割速度是各级党委重视与妥善安排劳动力的结果。早在大麦、元麦趋向黄熟时，各人民公社普遍采取了一改（改革工具）二挤（各行各业把劳动力挤出来）三安（统一安排）四管（统一管理）等办法，把80％以上的劳动力集中到夏收战线上来，大大增强了收割力量。
    为了加快收割进度，保证收割质量，各人民公社和生产队都将投入夏收的劳动力，分别组成了收割、运输、脱粒、拾穗草等专业队。太仓、常熟、江阴等县将夏收队伍兵分两路，做到边收割边抢运。在前几天那场大雨来到之前，割倒的麦子已经全部抢运上场。
    本报南昌28日电　江西省冬小麦普遍丰收。目前，全省各地组织了五十万劳动大军突击抢收，到5月26日止，已将占总面积70％以上的小麦抢收上场，正在加紧晒、打、入库，保证粒粒归仓。
    大面积平衡高产，是江西今年小麦丰收的突出特点。全省各地，不论平原或山区，不论熟地或荒地，不论历年高产地区或低产山区，普遍取得小麦丰收。过去从未种过小麦的赣南山区上犹县，去冬播种了一万多亩小麦，现已收割完毕，产量不低，破除了过去的“赣南山区不能种小麦”的论调。
    为了把丰收小麦及时收打上来，各地采取了一系列的抢收措施。组成收割专业队，把小麦逐丘排队，先熟先收，随熟随收，突击抢收。许多地区采取措施，使麦收工作由收割、运输、堆放到翻晒、入库等一气呵成，大大加快了进度。各级党委的书记和干部亲自深入田间，参加抢收、领导抢收，更加鼓舞了社员抢收小麦的积极性。
    本报上海28日电　上海市郊各县农村揭开夏收序幕。十一个县的元麦已经全部收完，大麦已收割70％以上。今年郊区种植的元麦、大麦面积比去年扩大四十万亩左右。半年来，各人民公社为了夺取麦子丰收，认真贯彻了“八字宪法”，与严寒、风雨、病虫害各种自然灾害作了艰苦的斗争，因此麦子生长良好，穗大粒多，茎秆粗壮，普遍胜过往年。从已经收割、脱粒的情况来看，无论试验田、丰产片、高产地区和低产地区今年都普告丰收。
    为了保证丰产丰收，各地在收获中都认真地做到熟一块割一块，割一块收一块，边收边运边拾，颗粒归仓。各公社在收获中做到“四轻”（轻割、轻捆、轻挑、轻放）、
  “五净”（田里净、路上净、船上净、场上净、柴上净）。崇明县江口公社第二生产队为了保证棵棵麦穗登场；组织了保粮立功队，专门拾麦穗。南汇县新港公社和平生产队也组织小学生，利用课余时间拾麦穗。（附图片）
