The Touchstone of True and False Peace
Commentator of this newspaper

    After the incident of the American air pirate's intrusion into the Soviet Union, all people around the world who genuinely desire peace have unanimously condemned the American act of aggression and supported the Soviet Union's just action to defend its sovereignty and condemn American aggression. Only a small handful of imperialists and their lackeys are busy trying to justify the United States, and even turn around and slander the Soviet Union for "threatening" peace and "creating tension." This is, of course, not surprising. But what is surprising is the discussion issued by some right-wing Indian newspapers:
    The "Hindustan Times" said: "Khrushchev must fully know that the world will not be deceived by his accusations: the plane shot down in Russian territory was carrying out an aggressive mission."
    The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" said: "The statement issued by the US State Department is completely correct. The Russians themselves have always been unwilling to accept the open door policy." The Soviet Union "exaggerated" the "seriousness" of the matter and "damaged" "international understanding and cooperation."
    The "Hindustan Daily" said: "The provocative language used by the Russian Prime Minister... will only aggravate the tension" and "make people doubt his loyalty to peace."
    The "New India Newspaper" said: The Soviet Union should "keep secret" the US aggression.
    A reporter for the "Indian Express" also praised the US State Department's statement, calling it a "milestone in diplomatic history" and Eisenhower's "glory."
    Some other Indian newspapers touted the United States for "saving the summit" and even condemned the Soviet Union for "not strengthening peace," "taking a war stance," and even saying that this was some kind of "communist habitual trick of creating tension before international conferences"...
    Can anyone who truly loves peace agree with the views of the above-mentioned Indian newspapers? The US government and Eisenhower himself have already confessed to the US planes' espionage activities of collecting intelligence, and the Gorky Central Culture and Rest Park in Moscow has exhibited evidence of US aggression. So, who is deceiving the world: is it the Soviet Union that exposed the US aggression, or some Indian newspapers that call themselves "peacekeepers"?
    If we follow the logic proposed in the commentaries of some Indian newspapers quoted above, the Soviet Union should open its doors and let American planes intrude at will. The Soviet government should remain silent and strictly "keep secret" the US aggression and not expose it. Is this the way to "international understanding and cooperation" advocated by some Indian newspapers?
    These Indian newspapers believe that the United States has the right to carry out activities to invade the Soviet Union, while the Soviet Union has the obligation to conceal the truth of American aggression. If the Soviet Union seriously exposes the US aggression, it is "aggravating the tension," it is "war-mongering," and it even makes people doubt the Soviet Union's "loyalty to peace." Is the exposure of the US aggression harmful to "peace"?
    The people of the world who love peace can never agree with this argument. Because it is very clear that since American planes invaded the Soviet Union and carried out military provocations, then the Soviet people and the people of socialist countries who sincerely safeguard world peace, as well as all peace-loving people in the world, must expose and oppose them. Otherwise, it will only encourage the aggressive arrogance of US imperialism and bring greater danger to world peace.
    Indeed, the US plane intrusion incident is a touchstone. Who is for true peace and who is for false peace can be clearly seen from the attitude towards this incident.

    真假和平的试金石
    本报评论员
    在美国空中强盗入侵苏联的事件发生后，全世界一切真正愿望和平的人们，同声谴责美国的侵略罪行，支持苏联维护主权、谴责美国侵略行为的正义行动。只有一小撮帝国主义分子及其喽罗们才忙着替美国进行辩解，甚至反过来诬蔑苏联“威胁”和平，“制造紧张局势”。这当然是不足为怪的。但值得惊奇的是印度一些右派报刊所发出的议论：
      “印度斯坦时报”说：“赫鲁晓夫一定充分知道，全世界不会受他这种指责的欺骗：在俄国领土上击落的飞机是在进行侵略性的任务”。
    “甘露市场报”说：“美国国务院发表的声明是完全正确的。俄国人自己一直不愿意接受门户开放政策”。苏联“夸大”了事情的“严重性”，“损害”了“国际谅解和合作”。
    “印度斯坦日报”说：“俄国总理……所使用的挑衅语言只会加剧紧张局势”，“使人怀疑他对于和平的忠诚”。
    “新印度报”说：苏联应该为美国的侵略“保密”。
      “印度快报”的记者还对美国国务院的声明捧场说这是“外交史上的里程碑”，是艾森豪威尔的“光荣”。
    还有一些印度报纸吹捧美国“拯救了最高级会谈”，竟然谴责苏联“不是加强和平”，“作好战姿态”，甚至说，这是什么“共产主义在国际会议前夕制造紧张的惯技”……
    任何真正热爱和平的人能够同意上述这些印度报纸的观点吗？美国政府和艾森豪威尔本人都已经供认了美国飞机搜集情报的间谍活动，莫斯科高尔基中央文化休息公园展出了美国侵略活动的罪证。那末，究竟是谁向全世界进行了欺骗：是揭露了美国侵略行为的苏联呢？还是那些自命为“和平维护者”的某些印度报纸呢？
    如果按照上面摘引的一些印度报纸评论中所提出的逻辑，苏联应该敞开自己的门户，让美国飞机任意侵入。苏联政府应该默不作声，要为美国的侵略严格进行“保密”，不得加以揭露。难道这就是某些印度报纸所提倡的“国际谅解和合作”之道？
    这些印度报纸认为，美国有权利进行侵略苏联的活动，而苏联却有义务隐瞒美国侵略的真相。如果苏联认真严肃地揭发了美国侵略的罪行，那就是“加剧紧张局势”，就是“好战”，甚至要人们怀疑苏联“对于和平的忠诚”。难道对美国侵略罪行的揭露就是危害“和平”？
    全世界爱好和平的人民决不能同意这种论点。因为事情很明白，既然美国飞机侵犯苏联，进行军事挑衅，那末，真诚维护世界和平的苏联人民和社会主义各国的人民以及全世界一切爱好和平的人民，就必须加以揭露和反对。否则只会助长美帝国主义的侵略气焰，给世界和平带来更大的危险。
    的确，美机侵苏事件是一块试金石，谁是真和平，谁是假和平，从对待这一事件的态度里，就可以看得一清二楚。
