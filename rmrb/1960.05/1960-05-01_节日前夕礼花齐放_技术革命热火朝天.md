Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th – Shanghai’s industrial workers are offering the “May Day” holiday brilliant achievements in production and innovation. On the eve of “May Day,” more than a thousand factories in the city had completed their April production plans ahead of schedule. In terms of technical innovation and revolution, since April, tens of thousands of innovation results have been applied to production throughout the city, and a large number of new technologies and processes have been created and adopted.

In order to create outstanding achievements to welcome International Labor Day on "May Day," all sectors of Shanghai have launched a large-scale mass movement, thereby promoting technical innovation and technical revolution to a new stage of consolidation, promotion, and improvement. Within just over ten days, textile factories throughout the city promoted and applied semi-automatic doffing machines on 2.6 million spindles and yarn spindles; some textile factories achieved semi-automation of doffing for tens of thousands of spindles throughout the factory in three days or even overnight. More than 2,000 innovation experts from various factories in the machinery industry formed 133 "advanced experience promotion groups," organized by industry and type of work. In ten days, they summarized 964 advanced experiences, which were matched into complete sets for 17 types of work and promoted comprehensively. Many factories have established "three-way combination" groups of leading cadres, workers, and technicians to identify innovation achievements one by one, and promote those that can be promoted immediately, ensuring that innovation achievements have an effect in production without missing a single one. The No. 1 Electric Hosiery Factory has put all 328 innovation projects achieved in the first quarter into production, and achieved 71 innovation projects in April, which greatly increased production efficiency, and the April plan was completed ahead of schedule.

During the days of welcoming "May Day," more than 700 major new technologies and processes are being promoted throughout the city, covering almost all industries and all major types of work. 89.2% of the new processes created by workers in various factories in Jing'an District are normally used in production.

This year's new products dedicated by Shanghai workers to "May Day" are becoming more and more advanced and precise, not only from large factories, but also from a large number of small factories. Jing'an District, which is mostly small and medium-sized factories, produced 1,845 new products in the first twenty-five days of April, equivalent to 86.9% of the total in the first quarter, of which 875 were high-grade, precise, and cutting-edge.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 30th – The broad masses of workers on the industrial front in Tianjin are celebrating International Labor Day with outstanding production achievements and fruitful technical revolution results.

By the 27th, 325 factories in the city had completed their April production plans ahead of schedule.

On the 29th, the city's industrial workers held a "Welcoming 'May Day' Production Great Battle" victory conference to report their achievements to the Party and the people of the city. The workers of many units are determined to launch an even greater production upsurge in Red May to ensure that May exceeds April.

Since April, the broad masses of workers in Tianjin have launched a bustling socialist labor competition of "Welcoming 'May Day' Production Great Battle."

The competition of the "Welcoming 'May Day' Production Great Battle" has made the magnificent technical revolution movement present a new situation of rapid change and progress by leaps and bounds. Things that could not be done for a long time in the past are now achieved in a few days, or even a few hours. With greater effort than the Great Leap Forward in Steel Production, the workers of Xingang Shipyard fought hard day and night on the 9th, achieving 113 innovation projects, which sharply increased the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization. 183 workers were freed from heavy manual labor.

During the competition, advanced experience was quickly spread throughout the city as soon as it appeared. From the city to the district, from the industry to the factory, advanced experience headquarters, promotion stations, and teams were established to summarize and compile the sporadic and scattered advanced experiences emerging from various factories, and quickly promote them in complete sets. The 17 advanced experiences with significant meaning and direction that the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to promote throughout the city have been widely applied in various industries.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th – On the eve of "May Day," workers and staff members of factories and enterprises in Guangzhou are successively offering gifts to the festival with outstanding achievements in production and technical innovation.

The activity of matching equipment and advanced technical experience into complete sets, which has been set off in factories throughout the city, reached a climax on the eve of "May Day." The scattered and incomplete experiences in 20 industries under the city's jurisdiction, such as weaving, casting, fitter, and steel rolling, and 160 industries under the district's jurisdiction, have now been matched into complete sets one after another. The Jiehe Steel Plant matched equipment and advanced experience into complete sets in the entire production process from heating, billet opening, steel rolling to loading and rolling according to the workshop and type of work, closely linking one link to another, so that labor productivity increased by 70%. On the basis of not adding equipment, it is estimated that about 17,000 tons of steel and more than 7,500 tons of steel billets can be increased this year.

The workers also created more high-grade, precise, and cutting-edge new products as gifts for the "May Day" festival and Red May. Silicon steel sheets, steel wire glass fiber cement boats, etc., which Guangzhou has never been able to produce, have been successfully trial-produced before "May Day."

This Newspaper's Dispatch - The Shaanxi Province "May Day" International Labor Day gift presentation meeting was grandly held in Xi'an on the afternoon of the 30th. More than 1,200 representatives from all parts of the province, carrying new creations in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, presented gifts and reported victory to the meeting. Shaanxi Provincial Party and government leaders attended the meeting and congratulated all the fighters in the great technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

From January to April this year, workers in the industrial, transportation, financial, trade systems have realized hundreds of thousands of technical innovation proposals. A large number of automatic production lines and linkage lines, as well as automated sections, workshops, and factories have appeared. On the agricultural front, in terms of agricultural tool reform alone, according to incomplete statistics, it has reached more than 3.3 million pieces. The more than 4,800 gifts brought by representatives from various places are the epitome of such great creativity of the working people of the province.

Since April, under the call of the Provincial Party Committee, laborers across the province have launched a movement to universalize and systematize the achievements of technical innovation. Industrial cities such as Xi'an, Baoji, Tongchuan, and Xianyang have respectively put forward specific goals of 30-ization, 20-ization, 34-ization, and 108-ization. Large-scale matching and becoming complete set meetings and exchange competitions were carried out, and large-scale evaluations and summaries were carried out to push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation to a new climax. Due to the promotion of technical innovation achievements, "increased production and reduced personnel" has been realized. In the industrial transportation and infrastructure construction, the state plan was completed ahead of schedule, April exceeded March, and more than 29,700 employees were transferred from the original production units to new production positions. The vast number of farmers also supported drought resistance with innovation and promoted innovation with drought resistance, overcoming the rare spring drought in many years, achieving "no drought phenomenon in 100 days of drought," and drought resistance produced technology and drought resistance produced science, and countless agricultural technology innovation creations appeared.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 30th – On the eve of "May Day," a number of industrial enterprises in Shanxi Province completed and exceeded their April and first half of the year production plans ahead of schedule.

The Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant completed and exceeded its production plan for the first half of the year on April 27, with a total output value 62% higher than the same period last year, a 50% increase in newly manufactured locomotives compared to the same period last year, product quality was qualified for each unit, and costs were greatly reduced.

At the same time, Taiyuan Jinxi Machine Factory, Taiyuan Boiler Factory, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, etc. also completed their April and first half of the year production plans ahead of schedule, and produced a large number of new products. The seamed tube drawing machine successfully trial-produced by Taiyuan Boiler Factory created favorable conditions for ensuring the supply of seamed pipes.

At present, the Party committees of various industrial enterprises are stepping up various production preparation work to ensure the continuous leap forward in production.

This Newspaper's Dispatch - The "Wanbao Street" (Ten Thousand Treasures Street) held by Kunming City employees to celebrate "May Day" International Labor Day opened on the 30th. Employees from the city's industrial, transportation, capital construction, finance and trade, and cultural and educational departments displayed the major achievements of this year's technological revolution and many new products on "Wanbao Street" to compete with each other for treasures.

On the 30th, tens of thousands of people came to "Wanbao Street" to spread treasures, view treasures, and obtain treasures. Zhao Zengyi, first secretary of the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and secretary Guo Shaochuan and other leaders also participated in this mass activity.

On the 30th, Spring City Kunming was bathed in bright and warm sunshine. Qingnian Road, which is one kilometer long and serves as "Wanbao Street", was lined with red flags and crowded with people. Following the stream of people viewing the treasures, the reporter walked into this street, which was decorated with lights and festive atmosphere everywhere. The "Wanbao Stage", "Gift Presentation Stage", and "Treasure Palace" lined up on both sides of the street were like hundreds of flowers blooming in spring, with all kinds of colors, making people dazzled. In front of the exhibition stand of Kunming No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, the reporter saw a model of the "native open-hearth furnace" created by the factory's employees. The structure of this furnace is very simple, but its power is extremely great. It can melt large pieces of scrap steel and scrap iron that ordinary converters cannot handle, creating a lot of wealth for the country. On the "Treasure Gathering Stage" of Kunming Machine Tool Plant, the reporter saw the first automated production line in Kunming. A young worker put the material on the feeding device, switched on the button, and a screw cap was produced in fifty seconds, replacing the manual operation of many workers in the past. There are now more than 500 such automatic production lines and assembly lines in the city. The "treasure" of the famous "poor stick" factory - Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory - is also particularly eye-catching. On one side, they displayed all the equipment they relied on to start their business - a pair of pliers and two scales; on the other side, they displayed the more sophisticated pneumatic tools such as rock drills, pneumatic picks, and tampers that the factory now produces. This sharp contrast makes people unable to disbelieve in the greatness of the working class and the power of the technological revolution.

Many "treasures" have greatly liberated the minds of those who view the treasures.

Going to the market is a traditional custom of people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan. But never has the content of going to "Wanbao Street" on the 30th been so rich and colorful, the meaning so profound, and the mood so enthusiastic. Many people lingered on "Wanbao Street", and they were inspired and encouraged by the millions of "treasures", which turned into the power to continue to advance to the technological revolution.

    目前，各工业企业党委正抓紧进行各项生产准备工作，以保证生产持续跃进。
    昆明举办“万宝街”庆祝“五一”
    本报讯　昆明市职工为庆祝“五一”国际劳动节而举办的“万宝街”在30日开放了。全市工业、交通、基本建设、财贸和文教部门职工，都把今年以来技术革命的重大成果和许多新产品陈列在“万宝街”上，互相赛宝。
    30日有成千上万的群众来到“万宝街”传宝、看宝、取宝。中共昆明市委第一书记赵增益和书记郭少川等负责人也参加了这一群众性的活动。
    30日，春城昆明沐浴在灿烂和煦的阳光里。作为“万宝街”的长达一公里的青年路，红旗如林，人头似海。记者随着看宝的人流，走进了这条到处张灯结采、喜气洋洋的街道。排列在街道两旁的“万宝台”、“献礼台”、“聚宝宫”里，有如春天盛开的百花，万紫千红，使人目不暇给。记者在昆明第一钢铁厂的展览台前，看到了这个厂职工创造的“土平炉”的模型。这种炉子的构造非常简单，但威力极大，它可以熔化一般转炉无法处理的大块废钢废铁，为国家创造大量财富。在昆明机床厂的“聚宝台”上，记者看到了昆明市的第一条自动化生产线。一个青年工人把材料放在送料装置上，扳开电钮，五十秒钟就生产出一只螺丝帽，代替了过去许多工人的手工操作。像这样的自动生产线和流水生产线，现在全市已经有五百多条。著名的“穷棒子”厂——昆明风动工具厂的“宝”也特别引人注意。这里一边陈列着他们凭着起家的全部设备——一把老虎钳和两根杆秤；另一边陈列着这一个厂现在生产的凿岩机、风镐、捣固机等较精密的风动工具。这个鲜明的对比使人不能不相信工人阶级的伟大和技术革命的威力。
    许多“宝”使得看宝人们的思想大大解放。
    赶街是云南各民族人民的传统习惯。但从来没有像30日赶“万宝街”的内容这样丰富多彩，意义这样深刻，情绪这样热烈。好多人在“万宝街”上流连忘返，他们从千万件“宝”中，得到启发，得到鼓舞，化成为继续向技术革命大进军的力量。
