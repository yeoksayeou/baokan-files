Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 3rd. The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today stating that the Turkish students' anti-government demonstrations have fundamentally shaken the rule of American imperialism and its lackeys in Turkey, and have dealt another heavy blow to American imperialism.

The commentary said that American imperialism and the Turkish Prime Minister Menderes clique attempted to maintain their sinful rule through brutal suppression and barbaric massacres, but today's situation shows that American imperialism's colonial rule policy has gone bankrupt everywhere, and no amount of high-pressure policies and guns can support fascist terror rule, nor can they frustrate the people's determination to fight for freedom, democracy, and independence.

The commentary said that Menderes will sooner or later suffer the same fate as Syngman Rhee. American imperialism supports reactionary forces everywhere in the world and enslaves the people of other countries, and the result is that it provokes anger and protest from the people everywhere. American imperialism must immediately get out of South Korea, Japan, South Vietnam, Turkey, and everywhere its clutches extend.

This newspaper reports that many French newspapers have commented on the Turkish people's anti-government demonstrations.

"L'Humanité" published an article on April 30 stating that the serious event of the Turkish people's anti-government demonstrations is the result of the policies pursued by the Democratic Party, which has been in power since 1950.

"L'Humanité" said, "With the support of banks, big businessmen, and landlords, the Democratic Party has continuously pursued a Cold War policy, which is reflecting disastrous consequences in all aspects. Foreign Minister Zorlu once said that Turkey has borrowed 3 billion US dollars, and it is estimated that this money will not be repaid before the year 2000." "L'Humanité" emphasized that "In Turkey, not only workers' organizations are banned, but the Menderes government has also taken increasingly cruel measures against all opposition factions in the bourgeoisie."

"L'Humanité" gave a high evaluation of the Turkish people's struggle in a commentary on May 2. The newspaper wrote: For those who can see clearly, for the world of tomorrow, what matters are those forces that rise up to smash unprecedentedly heavy chains. This force is to expel Syngman Rhee, to oppose the nearly four decades of terror rule in Turkey, to shake the nest that imperialism considers the most reliable, to stop the continued Cold War, and to serve the common cause of peace and genuine freedom.

"Libération" wrote on April 30 that Turkey and South Korea are undoubtedly countries that receive a large amount of aid from the United States. We are now seeing the inevitable consequences of a dangerous and outdated policy that relies solely on the Cold War and military treaties.

"Combat" also believes that the recent events in Turkey "will certainly serve as a serious warning to countries under the protection of the Central Treaty Organization."

This newspaper comprehensively reports that some Asian newspapers recently published editorials supporting the Turkish people's struggle against the traitorous regime.

The Indonesian "Youth Daily" said in an editorial on April 30 that the Turkish people are unwilling to be abused any longer because the ruling class of this country has close military and economic ties with the United States. "Dawn Daily" also expressed support for the Turkish students' struggle, saying that Turkish students are opposing this government that pursues Western policies and has become the pillar of the Central Treaty Organization.

The Pakistani "Today's News" published an editorial on April 30, pointing out that the Turkish students' anti-government demonstrations show that the situation in Turkey has reached a very deteriorated level, so that the youth are forced to rise up and fight.

The editorial said that the Turkish government has lost prestige among the people. The Turkish people disagree with many measures taken by the government.

The newspaper also said, "It seems that the Turkish rulers believe that they can still control the people with the help of the police and the army. They should learn a lesson from the events that have already happened in South Korea. When the people's anger reaches a certain limit, even the greatest power is useless in front of them." The newspaper also said that the Turkish students' demonstrations "are the prelude to upcoming events." (Attached image)

    各国舆论支持土耳其人民反独裁斗争
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”说：美帝国主义又受到一次沉重的打击
    法国“人道报”说：帝国主义认为是最可靠的巢穴动摇了
    新华社平壤3日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论说，土耳其学生的反政府示威从根本上动摇了美帝国主义及其走狗在土耳其的统治，又一次给美帝国主义以沉重的打击。
    评论说，美帝国主义和土耳其总理曼德列斯集团企图以粗暴的镇压和野蛮的屠杀来维持其罪恶统治，但今天的形势表明，美帝国主义的殖民统治政策在任何地方都破产了，任何高压政策和刀枪都不能支持法西斯恐怖统治，也不能挫折人民争取自由、民主、独立的决心。
    评论说，曼德列斯迟早要遭到李承晚一样的命运。美帝国主义在世界上到处扶植反动势力、奴役其他国家的人民，其结果是到处激发起人民的愤怒和抗议。美帝国主义必须立即从南朝鲜、日本、南越、土耳其，从它的魔掌伸到的一切地方滚出去。
    本报讯　法国不少报纸就土耳其人民反政府示威事件发表评论。
    “人道报”在4月30日发表的文章中说：土耳其人民反政府大示威这种严重的事件是自从1950年开始执政的民主党所奉行的政策的结果。
    “人道报”说，“民主党在银行、大商人和地主的支持下，不断奉行冷战政策，这种政策正在各方面反映出灾难性的后果。外交部长佐鲁曾经说，土耳其已经借了三十亿美元，这笔钱估计在公元二千年以前是还不清的。”“人道报”强调指出，“在土耳其，不仅工人的组织，全被禁止，而且曼德列斯政府对所有的资产阶级中的反对派也采取了愈来愈残酷的措施。”
    “人道报”在5月2日的评论里对土耳其人民的斗争作了很高的评价。这家报纸写道：对于那些看得清楚的人、对于明天世界来说，起作用的是那些起来粉碎空前沉重的锁链的那些力量。这种力量是为了驱逐李承晚，为了反对土耳其近四十年来的恐怖统治，为了动摇帝国主义认为是最可靠的巢穴，为了阻止继续进行冷战和为和平和真正自由的共同事业服务的。
    “解放报”在4月30日写道，土耳其和南朝鲜无疑都是得到美国大量援助的国家。我们现在看到了一种只是依靠冷战和军事条约的危险而过时的政策不可避免地遭受失败的后果。
    “战斗报”也认为土耳其最近的事件“肯定地将成为对中央条约组织庇护下的国家的严重警告”。
    本报综合报道　一些亚洲国家的报纸最近发表社论，支持土耳其人民反对卖国政权的斗争。
    印度尼西亚“青年报”在4月30日的社论中说，土耳其人民不愿再受虐待了，因为这个国家的统治阶级在军事上和经济上同美国有着密切的联系。“黎明日报”也表示支持土耳其学生的斗争，它说，土耳其学生正在反对这种奉行西方政策、并成为中央条约组织的台柱的政府。
    巴基斯坦“今天报”4月30日发表社论指出，土耳其学生反对政府的示威表明，土耳其的情况已经到了十分恶化的程度，以至青年被迫起来斗争。
    社论说，土耳其政府在人民当中已失去威信。土耳其人民不同意政府所采取的许多措施。
    这家报纸又说，“看来，土耳其统治者认为，他们借助警察和军队的帮助仍然能够控制人民。他们应该从南朝鲜已经发生的事件中吸取教训。当人民的愤怒达到一定的限度时，甚至最大的威力在他们面前也没有用处。”这家报纸还说，土耳其学生的示威“是即将到来的事件的前奏”。（附图片）
