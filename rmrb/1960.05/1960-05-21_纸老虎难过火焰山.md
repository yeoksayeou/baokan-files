　　Paper Tiger Has Trouble Crossing Flaming Mountain
　　Wang Lao Jiu
　　Hateful American imperialist wolf, wanting to exclusively dominate the world, walking sideways like a crab, bumping into the blade with eyes wide open. Started evil intentions themselves, and said others are deviating from the path, peace-loving people shout in unison, paper tiger has trouble crossing Flaming Mountain. The Soviet people do not agree, warning the American imperialists to deceive less, the force of the peace camp is great, a copper wall and iron barrier is hard to overthrow!

    纸老虎难过火焰山
    王老九可恨美帝野心狼，想把世界独霸占，螃蟹走路它横行，睁着眼睛碰刀尖。自家起了坏心肠，还说别人路走偏，和平人民同声吼，纸老虎难过火焰山。苏联人民不答应，警告美帝少欺骗，和平阵营力量大，铜墙铁壁难推翻！
