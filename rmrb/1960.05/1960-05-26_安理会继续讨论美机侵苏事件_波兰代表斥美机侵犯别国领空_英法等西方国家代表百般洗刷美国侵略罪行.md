Xinhua News Agency, May 25th dispatch from New York (TASS): The United Nations Security Council continued its discussion yesterday afternoon on the issue raised by the Soviet government regarding the US military aircraft's aggressive act against the Soviet Union, which constitutes a threat to peace.

The outcome of the Security Council's first day of discussing this important and pressing issue raised by the Soviet Union can be seen from the discussions outside the UN venue and in the press circles. In assessing this result, one can find how profound the difference is between the calm, well-founded, dignified, and peace-loving stance of the Soviet government, as elucidated by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko in the Security Council, and the evasive and shameless denial of obvious facts held by the US representative.

The Soviet representative's speech convincingly demonstrated that the US aircraft's aggressive actions against the Soviet Union, the US aircraft's frantic violation of Soviet airspace, were pre-planned by the US and a policy it counted on. The Soviet representative's speech showed that the US was the destroyer of the Paris Summit Conference. Gromyko's speech showed that the entire nature of current US foreign policy creates distrust in international relations.

The Soviet Union's firm exposure of the US's provocative policies and its resolute defense of the spirit of universally recognized norms of international law have won the universal approval and gratitude of all peace-loving countries.

The evasive words uttered by US representative Lodge were extremely clumsy and unconvincing. He pretended to have "forgotten" that US government leaders had, in fact, admitted that the provocative spy flights of US aircraft were premeditated. Thus, Lodge embarked on a path of denying irrefutable guilt with empty words. He insisted that the "U-2" aircraft were not armed, disregarding the fact that the world now clearly knows that these equipments include instruments for electronic reconnaissance of the Soviet air defense radar system and high-altitude photography instruments.

It is worth noting that just a week before the US diplomat delivered his speech offering clumsy defenses, "Time" magazine reported that infrared photographic equipment could "photograph" vast areas of the Soviet Union and capture "tall factory chimneys," that is, photograph Soviet industrial targets. On the map published in this magazine, the Sverdlovsk region, targeted by the "U-2" spy plane, was marked with the words "Ural Industrial Complex." How much is Lodge's absurd argument that the purpose of the US spy flights was to prevent some kind of "danger" to the US worth under this admission?

The second day of the Security Council's discussion showed that even countries with close allied relations with the United States had to admit that the US aggressive act was extremely illegal. For example, French representative Bélar, the first to speak at the meeting yesterday, could not help but admit that "the May 1st incident and the cross-border flights condemned by the Soviet government actually belong to the category of reconnaissance activities." Bélar said, "There is no doubt that such activities...mean interference in the internal affairs of a country." The French representative said, "My government hopes that countries will oppose similar activities."

However, the French representative's performance was inconsistent, as he expressed doubts about the urgency of the issue to be discussed. Apparently to maintain the position of its old partner in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the French representative actually said that the French delegation was "very doubtful" about the "aggressive nature of the actions brought to the attention" of the Security Council. The French representative believes that the kind of espionage reconnaissance activities conducted by US aircraft "are common practice nowadays."

Bélar insisted that the aggressive actions of US aircraft were not "any international violation."

The French representative finally said that his delegation would not support the draft resolution proposed by the Soviet Union.

British representative Dixon also delivered a speech assisting the aggressive actions of US aircraft. The British representative attempted to justify the reconnaissance flights of US military aircraft in Soviet airspace, saying that "this is due to" the "lack of trust" between the two major powers.

The Argentine representative said that there was no reason to believe that violating the principle of the inviolability of countries was justified behavior. However, he immediately said that it seemed that the threat to peace was not the US aircraft flying in Soviet airspace, but the Soviet Union raising the issue of such flights to the Security Council. The Argentine representative said that he would vote against the Soviet proposal.

Like the representatives of other countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Italian representative also played the role of shielding US aggressive flights and policies.

The speech of Polish representative Michalowski made a strong impression. He said that recent events have proved that the issue raised by the Soviet government for the Security Council to review is of great importance. In order to refute the fabricated abuses fabricated by the United States and Western countries, the Polish representative convincingly pointed out that the flight of US military aircraft in other countries' airspace is a barbaric violation of national sovereignty, various treaties, and the United Nations Charter. He emphasized that the United States is a participant in many of these treaties. Michalowski pointed out that the attempts by the US authorities to justify the spy flights of US aircraft are absurd. He said that, in fact, these flights created danger. Therefore, the Polish delegation cannot accept the so-called guarantee that these flights have no aggressive nature. The military bases established by the United States in other countries and used for spy flights pose a great danger to international peace.

The Polish representative finally said that the Security Council should restore the efficiency of the law, respect its obligations, and take appropriate action in international relations. Given that this is precisely the purpose of the Soviet draft resolution, the Polish delegation will vote in favor of this draft.

### 安理会继续讨论美机侵苏事件  波兰代表斥美机侵犯别国领空  英法等西方国家代表百般洗刷美国侵略罪行

    安理会继续讨论美机侵苏事件
    波兰代表斥美机侵犯别国领空
    英法等西方国家代表百般洗刷美国侵略罪行
    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社纽约25日讯：联合国安全理事会昨天下午继续讨论苏联政府提出的关于美国军用飞机对苏联进行了对和平造成威胁的侵略行动的问题。
    从联合国会场外和新闻界的议论中可以看出安全理事会第一天讨论苏联提出的这个重要而迫切的问题的结果。在估价这一结果时可以发现，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在安全理事会阐述的苏联政府的沉着稳重、有根有据、充满尊严和爱好和平精神的立场同美国代表所持的支吾搪塞无耻抵赖明显事实的立场之间有着多么深刻的区别。
    苏联代表的发言令人信服地表明，美国飞机对苏联的侵略行动、美国飞机对苏联领空的疯狂侵犯是美国事先策划好的和它所指望的政策。苏联代表的发言表明，美国是巴黎政府首脑会议的破坏者。葛罗米柯的发言表明，美国当前外交政策的整个性质造成了国际关系中的不信任。
    苏联坚决揭露美国的挑衅性政策，苏联坚决维护公认的国际法准则的精神博得了所有爱好和平国家的普遍赞同和感激。
    美国代表洛奇发表的支吾搪塞的话是十分拙劣的和不能令人信服的。他装腔作势地说，他“忘记”了美国政府领导人实际上已经承认了美国飞机的挑衅性间谍飞行具有预谋的性质，于是洛奇走上了空口抵赖确凿的罪责的道路。他硬说，
  “U—2型”飞机没有武装，而不顾全世界现在已经清楚知道，这些装备包括用电子侦察苏联防空雷达系统的仪器和高空摄影仪器。
    值得注意的是，就在美国外交家发表演说进行拙劣的辩解的前一个星期，美国“时代”杂志报道，红外线摄影设备可以“拍下”苏联的“广大地区”，并把“高大的工厂烟囱”定影下来，也就是说拍下苏联的工业目标。在这家杂志刊出的地图上，作为“U—2型”间谍飞机目标的斯维德洛夫斯克地区标有“乌拉尔工业综合区”的字样。洛奇所谓的美国间谍飞行的目的是为了防止对美国的某种“危险”的荒谬论调在这种供认下能值几文钱呢？
    安理会讨论的第二天表明，甚至那些与美国有密切的盟国关系的国家也不得不承认美国侵略行动是极端非法的。例如，法国代表贝拉尔昨天在会上第一个发言时就不能不承认，“5月1日事件和苏联政府谴责的越境飞行实际上是属于侦察活动之类的。”贝拉尔说，“毫无疑问，这种活动……意味着对一个国家的内政的干涉。”法国代表说，“我的政府希望各国能够反对类似活动。”
    但是法国代表的表现前后不一，他竟对要讨论的问题的迫切性表示怀疑。法国代表显然是为了维护它的北大西洋公约组织的老伙伴的立场，他竟说什么法国代表团“非常怀疑”安全理事会“注意的行动的侵略性质”。法国代表认为像美国飞机所进行的这种间谍侦察活动“是现今的惯例”。
    贝拉尔硬说什么美国飞机的侵略行动不是“什么国际侵犯”。
    法国代表最后说，他的代表团将不支持苏联提出的决议草案。
    英国代表迪克逊也发表了替美国飞机的侵略行动帮凶的讲话。英国代表企图把美国军用飞机在苏联领空的侦察飞行说成是正当的，说什么“这是由于”在两大国之间
  “缺乏信任而引起的”。
    阿根廷代表说，没有任何理由认为破坏各国的不可侵犯性的原则是正当的行为。但是，他马上又说，似乎威胁和平的不是美国飞机在苏联的领空飞行，而是苏联向安理会提出了关于这种飞行的问题。阿根廷代表说，他将投票反对苏联的提案。
    同北大西洋公约组织的其他国家的代表一样，意大利的代表也扮演了袒护美国侵略性飞行和政策的角色。
    波兰代表米哈洛夫斯基的发言给人留下了强烈的印象。他说，最近所发生的事件证明，苏联政府提请安理会审查的问题具有极大的重要性。为了驳斥美国和西方国家代表所捏造的滥言，波兰代表令人信服地指出了美国军用飞机在别国领空飞行是对国家主权、对各种条约和联合国宪章的野蛮的破坏行为。他着重指出，美国是许多这种条约的参加者。米哈洛夫斯基指出，美国当局为美国飞机的间谍飞行辩解的企图是荒谬的。他说，实际上，这种飞行造成了危险。因此波兰代表团不能接受所谓这种飞行没有侵略性质的担保。美国在别国设立的、用来进行间谍飞行的军事基地对国际和平具有很大的危险性。
    波兰代表最后说，安全理事会应该恢复法律的效率，尊重它所承担的义务，在国际关系中采取应有的行动。鉴于这正是苏联决议草案的目的，波兰代表团将投票赞成这一草案。
