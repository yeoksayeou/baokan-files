Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou – People's communes in Zhejiang's silkworm producing areas have fully begun raising spring silkworms. The entire province's first batch of 1,124,000+ silkworm egg sheets have been distributed.

Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the situation in Zhejiang's silkworm production this year is excellent. The vast numbers of commune members in the silkworm areas are working with great energy, resolutely implementing the policy of "raising more, producing more, harvesting more, and selling more," and are determined to achieve high-speed development in silkworm production this year, striving for "spring cocoon production in one season to exceed the entire year's output." The number of spring silkworm egg sheets distributed throughout the province has increased by more than 55% compared to last year. Preparations for mulberry garden cultivation and management, silkworm rearing room and tool disinfection, and other tasks have started earlier and been done better than in any previous year.

To enable high-speed development of cocoon production, people's communes in the silkworm areas have greatly increased the construction of silkworm rearing rooms and the procurement of silkworm rearing tools this year. Nearly 200,000 silkworm rearing rooms have been built throughout the province, and 11,190,000 silkworm trays have been purchased.

This newspaper reports that Jiangsu Province, one of the nation's key silkworm producing areas, has greatly increased the amount of spring silkworm rearing this year. As of May 5th, over 485,000 silkworm egg sheets had been distributed. The famous seven high-yield silkworm counties, including Wuxi, Wujiang, and Jiangyin, have increased their silkworm rearing volume by 40% to 80% compared to the same period last year, reaching one silkworm egg sheet raised per mu of mulberry field. In the new silkworm areas of northern Jiangsu, many people's communes regard raising spring silkworms on a large scale as an important economic measure for poor teams to catch up with wealthy teams, and 17 counties and cities have more than doubled their rearing volume compared to the same period last year.

To increase the production of more mulberry leaves, many areas have continued to strengthen mulberry field cultivation and management on the basis of the work done last winter and this spring. The Suzhou Special Zone has proposed a major campaign to cultivate the three types of mulberry trees and skillfully apply foliar fertilizer. In the entire zone, except for 20,000 mu designated as special mulberry gardens for young silkworms, rapid-acting fertilizer and foliar fertilizer have been widely applied to 110,000 mu of mulberry gardens, striving to increase mulberry leaf production by another 10% to 20% on the existing basis to ensure that silkworms are well-fed.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu – Sichuan Province is vigorously raising spring silkworms in large quantities, striving for spring cocoon production in one season to equal the whole year's output. By the end of April, the province had distributed over 320,000 silkworm egg sheets to people's communes in various regions, about twice as many as in the same season last year.

Currently, more than 194,000 new and renovated silkworm rearing rooms have been built throughout the province. The silkworm rearing rooms in various places have used indigenous methods to prepare sufficient silkworm mats, silkworm nets, and disinfectant medicines.

Each major silkworm raising area actively expanded mulberry gardens. Last winter and this spring, the entire province planted 370 million new mulberry trees, and widely adopted advanced planting methods of planting in belts, patches, and lines. Detailed management, such as fertilization, pruning, pest control, and weeding, has also been carried out on existing mulberry trees.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou – People's communes in Guangdong that raise silkworms, after obtaining a bumper harvest of the first batch of spring silkworms this year, have begun the rearing work for the second batch of silkworms.

In Guangdong, due to heavy rainfall, high temperatures, and rising temperatures in April and May each year, silkworms are prone to illness and death, hence the term "rotten second batch." This year, to strive for a continued great leap forward in silkworm production, the vast numbers of silkworm farmers have made full preparations for raising the second batch of silkworms under the slogans of "eliminate rotten batches" and "achieve high yields from rotten batches." The province has prepared 200,000 second-batch silkworm egg sheets. Various localities have also grasped the management of mulberry fields to promote increased mulberry leaf production, striving for a bumper harvest of second-batch cocoons.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun – Jilin is currently seizing the preparations for releasing spring silkworms.

In accordance with the principle of "cultivating forests on distant mountains and steep slopes, and raising silkworms on nearby mountains and gentle slopes," and "considering both silkworms and forests, combining utilization with cultivation," people's communes in various places are properly arranging labor, actively supporting and clearing oak forests, and vigorously carrying out silkworm farm construction. By the end of April, the province had renewed over 4,400 hectares of silkworm farms and expanded new silkworm farms by over 16,000 hectares.

Jilin Province has many mountains and dense forests, with abundant oak forest resources, making it an ideal place to develop oak silkworm production. By 1959, the oak silkworm release volume had increased by more than 4.5 times compared to the early days of liberation. This year's planned release volume is more than double that of last year. While vigorously developing oak silkworm production, various localities are also actively experimenting with raising mulberry silkworms and castor silkworms.

    力争春茧产量一季赶全年
    浙江江苏四川广东大量饲养春蚕
    吉林充分利用丰富柞林资源积极发展柞蚕
    据新华社杭州电　浙江桑蚕产区各人民公社，已全面开始饲养春蚕。全省首批春蚕一百一十二万四千多张蚕种已全部出库。
    在各级党委的领导下，浙江省今年蚕桑生产的形势很好。蚕区广大社员，大鼓干劲，坚决贯彻“多养、高产、多收、多售”的方针，决心实现今年蚕桑生产的高速度发展，力争“春茧一季产量超全年”。全省春蚕发种的数量，比去年增加55％以上。桑园培育管理、蚕室蚕具防病消毒等各项准备工作，都比以往任何一年动手早，做得好。
    为使蚕茧生产高速度发展，蚕区各人民公社今年大量增建蚕室和添置养蚕用具。全省已修建蚕室近二十万间，添置蚕匾一千一百一十九万只。
    本报讯　全国重点蚕区之一的江苏省，今年春蚕饲养量大大增加。到5月5日止，出库蚕种已达四十八万五千多张。著名的无锡、吴江、江阴等七个蚕桑高产县养蚕量分别比去年同期增加四成到八成，达到一亩桑田养一张蚕种；苏北新蚕区很多人民公社把大养春蚕作为穷队赶富队的重要经济措施之一，有十七个县、市的饲养量超过去年同期一倍以上。
    为了增产更多的桑叶，很多地区在去冬今春管理的基础上继续加强桑田培育管理。苏州专区提出大战三类桑、巧施根外肥，全区除二万亩作为稚蚕专用桑园外，十一万亩桑园中都普施了速效肥和根外肥，力争在现有基础上再增产一、二成桑叶，保证蚕儿吃饱、吃好。
    据新华社成都电　四川省各地大量饲养春蚕，力争春蚕一季赶全年。4月末，全省已向各地人民公社发下春蚕蚕种三十二万多张，比去年同季多一倍左右。
    目前全省已新建和改建蚕房十九万四千多间。各地的蚕房都用土办法，准备了足够的蚕?、蚕网和消毒药品。
    各主要养蚕区积极扩大桑园，去冬今春，全省共栽新桑三亿七千万株，并普遍采用了成带、成片、成线的先进种植方法；对原有的桑树，也进行了施肥、修枝、治虫、锄草等细致的管理。
    据新华社广州电　广东各地养蚕的人民公社，在获得了今年头轮春蚕大丰收后，又开始了第二造蚕的饲养工作。
    广东每年4、5月由于雨水多，温度高，气温上升，蚕儿容易生病死掉，有“烂二造”之称。今年，广大蚕农为了争取蚕桑生产继续大跃进，在“消灭烂造”“要烂造高产”的口号下，对养好二造蚕做了充分准备。全省已备好二十万张二造蚕种。各地还抓紧了桑田的管理工作。促使桑叶增产，力争二造蚕茧丰收。
    据新华社长春电　吉林各地目前正在大抓放养春蚕的准备工作。
    各地人民公社本着“远山陡坡育林，近山慢坡养蚕”，“蚕林兼顾，用育结合”的原则，妥善安排劳力，积极扶育和清理柞林，大搞蚕场建设。到4月末，全省已更新蚕场四千四百多公顷，扩大新蚕场一万六千多公顷。
    吉林省山多林密，有丰富的柞林资源，是发展柞蚕生产的理想场所。到1959年，柞蚕放养量已比解放初期增加四点五倍以上。今年的计划放养量又比去年增加一倍以上。各地在大力发展柞蚕生产的同时，还积极试养桑蚕和蓖麻蚕。
