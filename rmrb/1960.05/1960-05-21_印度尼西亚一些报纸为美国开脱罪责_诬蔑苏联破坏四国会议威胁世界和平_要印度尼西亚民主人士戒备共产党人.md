Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 19th Dispatch: Some Indonesian newspapers are viciously attacking Khrushchev's just stand on the Four-Power Summit Conference and exonerating the United States for its crime of sabotaging the conference.

The English-language "Indonesia Times" frantically attacked Khrushchev, slandering him for "deliberately sabotaging" the summit "at the very moment of its birth." This newspaper also turned black into white, falsely accusing Khrushchev of "threatening world peace and security because of his malicious attitude and conspiracy to achieve a propaganda victory."

The Socialist Party's "Kompas" newspaper, while showering abuse on Khrushchev's solemn position, clamored that "the slogan of peaceful coexistence will end," and said with ulterior motives, "The Communists will adopt a 'tough and belligerent' attitude."

This newspaper provocatively called on Indonesian democrats to "be wary of future actions by the Communists in Indonesia."

"The Independent" described the United States' sabotage of the summit as "the only and last resort." It also praised "the West for showing solidarity to save the United States (the leader of the Western bloc)," and falsely accused Khrushchev of "wanting to smear the reputation of the United States in a very shameful way at the summit."

"Indonesian News" absurdly stated that Khrushchev should realize that his demands were high and difficult for "a president like Eisenhower, who is fully responsible for his country's policies" to meet. This newspaper also blatantly applied powder to Eisenhower, saying, "Eisenhower's attitude in the face of the failure of the summit is commendable."

    印度尼西亚一些报纸为美国开脱罪责
    诬蔑苏联破坏四国会议威胁世界和平
    要印度尼西亚民主人士戒备共产党人
    新华社19日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚一些报纸恶毒攻击赫鲁晓夫在四国首脑会议问题上的严正立场，并且为美国破坏会议的罪行开脱责任。
    英文的“印度尼西亚时报”疯狂地攻击赫鲁晓夫，诬蔑他“在最高级会议诞生的那个时候就故意破坏了它”。这家报纸还颠倒黑白地诬蔑赫鲁晓夫“由于他的恶劣态度和取得一次宣传胜利的阴谋而威胁了世界和平和安全”。
    社会党的“指南针报”在滥施攻击赫鲁晓夫的严正立场的同时，叫嚣“和平共处的口号将结束”，并且别有用心地说，“共产党人将采取‘强硬和好战的’态度”。
    这家报纸挑拨性地要印度尼西亚民主人士“戒备共产党人将来在印度尼西亚的行动”。
    “独立报”把美国破坏首脑会议的召开说成是“唯一和最后的办法”。它还赞扬“西方表现出团结一致，来拯救美国（西方集团的领袖）”，并且诬蔑赫鲁晓夫“想在最高级会议上以非常可耻的方式沾污美国的名声。”
    “印度尼西亚新闻”荒谬地说，赫鲁晓夫应该认识到，他的要求很高，是“一位像艾森豪威尔这样为他的国家的政策负完全责任的总统”很难满足的。这家报纸还露骨地为艾森豪威尔擦粉说，“艾森豪威尔在面临最高级会议失败中所采取的态度是可以赞同的。”
