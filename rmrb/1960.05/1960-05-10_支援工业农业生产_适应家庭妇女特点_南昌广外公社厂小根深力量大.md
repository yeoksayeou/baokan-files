Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, May 8th: The Guangwai People's Commune in Nanchang City, mainly composed of street residents, has relied on the masses and started from scratch to develop production, achieving great results. Last year, the total output value of commune-run industries reached more than 2 million yuan, an increase of 225% compared with 1958. The number of products reached more than 700, compared to only 150 in 1958.

The Guangwai People's Commune was established in 1958 during the Great Leap Forward in steel production, in order to meet the requirements of street residents for large-scale steelmaking and organizing their lives. Before and after the establishment of the commune, the street residents organized some production groups to process products for large factories and some service-oriented production groups. Due to low technical levels and limitations in raw materials, these production groups developed very slowly. Some production groups also overlapped each other, and their locations were scattered, causing many difficulties in production. After the establishment of the commune, the original dozens of production groups were reorganized and merged into seventeen small factories.

These small factories had no equipment, funds, or factory buildings at the beginning, and there were no technical personnel. It was truly "poor and blank." However, the commune members were very enthusiastic about running the factories, and they came up with many ways to overcome difficulties. Without equipment and raw materials, the commune members brought their own tools and some scrap metal to support the factories. They also adopted the method of learning from those who are capable and teaching each other to improve the technical level of the workers.

Although these factories were poor and small, they were built by everyone's own hands, and the commune members loved them very much and were full of energy. Cadres and commune members worked day and night, raising materials and equipment in every possible way, expanding production, and trying their best to connect with some large factories in the city to strive for mutual cooperation and mutual support. The large factories also actively contacted the commune to process business because the specifications and quality of street industrial products were guaranteed after the establishment of the commune, and they gave great support to the commune-run enterprises in terms of raw materials and technology. In this way, the commune's commune-run industry developed vigorously.

According to the characteristics of the commune members, who were mostly housewives who had just left the stove, and the principle of commune-run factories serving large factories, serving agriculture, and serving the market, the commune decided that the factories run by the commune should mainly be service industries and processing industries. In this way, raw materials and technical equipment were guaranteed, and production was carried out by combining centralized and decentralized methods. Now, the whole commune has bee tool factories, car cylinder factories, grass bag factories, brush factories serving industrial and agricultural production, oil pressing and egg product factories, black and white iron factories, fried food processing factories serving people's lives; brush factories serving large industries; and service-oriented hairdressing tool repair factories, clothing factories, round wood factories, furniture repair groups, shoe-making groups, and a transportation team with 180 people.

Since the establishment of the commune, the idle labor force on the streets has been basically fully employed due to the large-scale development of production. Now there are more than 600 women participating in the production of commune-run factories. Since 1958, the whole commune has supported more than 600 technical workers to large factories. Because of the development of production, the living standards of the masses have also been greatly improved. In the past, 2,000 yuan of relief funds were distributed here every year to help residents with difficult lives, but now no one needs relief, and most commune members have savings.

With the development of production, the commune has also established seven public canteens, seven nurseries, and seven living service stations, so that commune members are free from housework and can participate in production with peace of mind. The commune also established a primary school with more than 500 students, which is double the number in 1958. It also established a Red and Expert School and established many after-work study groups according to production teams. Commune members all participated in after-work political and cultural studies. Because the broad masses of commune members participated in collective production, their collectivist ideology and socialist ideological awareness improved. Commune members love labor, love collective life, families are united, neighborhoods are more harmonious, and the entire street presents a thriving scene.

    支援工业农业生产　适应家庭妇女特点
    南昌广外公社厂小根深力量大
    广大妇女参加了社办工厂的生产全社已支援了大工厂六百多个技术工人
    据新华社南昌8日电　南昌市以街道居民为主组成的广外人民公社，依靠群众，白手创业发展生产，取得了很大成绩。去年社办工业的总产值达到二百多万元，较1958年增长225％，产品有七百多种，而1958年只有一百五十种。
    广外人民公社是在1958年大搞钢铁运动中，为了适应街道居民大炼钢铁和把生活组织起来的要求，在当地党组织的领导下成立的。在公社建立前后，这里的街道居民们举办了一些为大工厂加工产品的生产小组和服务性的生产小组，这些生产小组由于技术水平低和原料材料等限制，发展很慢，有一些生产小组又彼此重复，地址分散，给生产上造成了许多困难。公社成立后，就把原来的几十个生产小组整顿、合并为十七个小型工厂。
    这些小型工厂在举办初期既无设备、资金、厂房，又无技术人材，真是“一穷二白”。但是，社员们办厂的热情很高，他们想了许多办法来克服困难。没有设备和原料、材料，社员们就自己带工具，自己带些破铜烂铁来支持办厂。还采取了能者为师、互教互学的办法来提高工人的技术水平。
    这些厂虽然又穷又小，但这是大家亲自动手筹办起来的，社员们十分热爱，干劲很足。干部和社员们不管黑夜白天，四处张罗，千方百计地筹集原材料、设备，扩大生产，并尽力设法和市里的一些大工厂挂钩，争取和大工厂互相协作、互相支援。大工厂也因为建立公社后，街道工业产品的规格和质量有了保证，也纷纷主动和公社联系加工业务，并且在原材料、技术等方面给予社办企业以很大支持。就这样，这个公社的社办工业，就蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。
    公社根据社员们都是刚离开锅台的家庭妇女的特点，和社办工厂为大工厂服务、为农业服务、为市场服务的方针，决定公社兴办的工厂主要是一些服务性行业和加工行业，这样原料材料、技术装备都有保障，在生产上则采取集中与分散相结合等办法进行生产。现在，全公社已经有为工农业生产服务的蜂具厂、车筒厂、草包厂、制刷厂，有为人民生活服务的酿油蛋品厂、黑白铁厂、炒货加工厂；有为大工业服务的制刷厂；还有服务性的理发工具修制厂、服装厂、圆木厂、家具修制组、制鞋组和一个拥有一百八十人的搬运队。
    公社成立后由于白手起家大办生产事业，街道上的闲散劳动力已经基本上全部就业。现在光参加社办工厂生产的妇女就有六百多人。全社从1958年以来支援了大工厂六百多个技术工人。因为生产事业的发展，群众的生活水平也有了很大提高，过去每年这里要发两千元救济费救济生活困难的居民，现在已经没有人要救济了，一般社员都有了存款。
    随着生产事业的发展，这个公社还举办了七个公共食堂、七个托儿所、七个生活服务站，使社员摆脱了家务牵累，能安心参加生产。公社还举办了一所小学，现有学生五百多人，较1958年增长了一倍，建立了一所红专学校，按照生产班组建立了许多业余学习小组，社员们都参加了业余政治文化学习。由于广大社员参加集体生产，因此集体主义思想和社会主义思想觉悟提高了。社员们热爱劳动，热爱集体生活，家庭团结，邻里更加和睦，整个街道呈现着一片欣欣向荣的景象。
