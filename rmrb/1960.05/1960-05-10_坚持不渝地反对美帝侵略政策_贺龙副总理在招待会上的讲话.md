Comrade Ambassador, Comrade Head of the Czechoslovak Friendship Delegation and all its members, dear comrades and friends:

Today we are very pleased to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia together with our Czechoslovak comrades. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, to extend our warmest congratulations to the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the Czechoslovak government, and the Czechoslovak people.

The fraternal Czechoslovak people, with the help of the heroic Soviet army, have completely changed the face of their motherland in just fifteen years, building Czechoslovakia into a strong socialist country with a high level of industrialization.

Last year, the Czechoslovak Communist Party put forward the directives for the third five-year plan for the development of the national economy from 1961 to 1965, showing the people of the country an even brighter prospect. We believe that the Czechoslovak people will surely victoriously complete this glorious task.

For fifteen years, Czechoslovakia has made many contributions to consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia steadfastly pursues a foreign policy of peace. It is waging an unswerving struggle against the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war, against the West German militarist expansion of armaments and preparations for war, to ease international tensions, and to safeguard European and world peace. All this makes Czechoslovakia play an increasingly important role in international affairs.

Comrades, we are pleased to see that under the glorious light of Marxism-Leninism, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries have been continuously developing. We are deeply convinced that in the future, with the continuous progress of the socialist construction undertakings of the two countries, the fraternal friendship between our two countries will be further developed, and the mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries in political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological fields will become even closer.

Finally, please allow me to raise my glass:

    For the new great achievements of the Czechoslovak people in the future cause of socialist and communist construction,
    To the constant consolidation and development of the fraternal friendship and close cooperation between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples,
    To the increasing strength of the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
    To the health of President Novotny, Chairman Fierlinger, and Premier Široký,
    To the health of today's host, Ambassador Bušiak and his wife,
    To the health of Comrade Obafsky, head of the Czechoslovak Friendship Delegation, and all members of the delegation,
    Cheers to the Czechoslovak experts and their wives who are helping our country in socialist construction!

    坚持不渝地反对美帝侵略政策
    ——贺龙副总理在招待会上的讲话——亲爱的大使同志，亲爱的捷克斯洛伐克友好代表团团长同志和全体团员同志们，亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    今天我们非常高兴同捷克斯洛伐克同志们一道，共同欢庆捷克斯洛伐克解放十五周年。请允许我代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，向捷克斯洛伐克共产党、捷克斯洛伐克政府和捷克斯洛伐克人民致以最热烈的祝贺。
    兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民，在英勇的苏军帮助下获得解放以后，仅用了十五年的时间，便彻底地改变了自己祖国的面貌，把捷克斯洛伐克建设成为一个具有高度工业水平的社会主义强国。
    去年，捷克斯洛伐克共产党提出了1961到1965年的第三个发展国民经济的五年计划指示，给全国人民展示了更加美好的前景。我们相信，捷克斯洛伐克人民一定会胜利地完成这一光荣的任务。
    十五年来，捷克斯洛伐克为巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，作出了不少的贡献。捷克斯洛伐克坚定地奉行着和平外交政策，它为反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，反对西德军国主义的扩军备战，为缓和国际紧张局势，维护欧洲和世界和平进行着坚持不渝的斗争。这一切使得捷克斯洛伐克在国际事务中起着日益重要的作用。
    同志们，我们高兴地看到，在马克思列宁主义的光辉照耀下，我们两国的友好合作关系一直在不断发展。我们深信，今后随着两国社会主义建设事业的不断前进，我们两国兄弟般的友谊，一定会得到进一步的发展，我们两国在政治、经济、文化和科学技术方面的互助合作关系也一定会更加紧密。
    最后，请让我举杯：
    为捷克斯洛伐克人民在今后的社会主义和共产主义的建设事业中获得新的伟大成就，
    为中捷两国人民的兄弟友谊和亲密合作不断巩固和发展，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结日益加强，
    为诺沃提尼总统、费林格主席和西罗基总理的健康，
    为今天招待会的主人布希尼亚克大使和夫人的健康，
    为捷克斯洛伐克友好代表团团长奥巴夫斯基同志和代表团全体同志们的健康，
    为帮助我国进行社会主义建设的捷克斯洛伐克专家和他们的夫人的健康，干杯！
