Xinhua News Agency Report: China's cotton-producing areas have completed over 90% of their cotton sowing tasks. Among these, 80% of the cotton fields have sprouted. Currently, various localities are continuing to firmly grasp the final stages of cotton sowing and are carrying out crash sowing of wheat stubble cotton. Simultaneously, they are vigorously developing an initial cotton field management campaign centered on inspecting and replenishing seedlings and inspecting and re-sowing.

This year, the cotton sowing time in various parts of China was generally appropriately earlier than last year, and the sowing quality also surpassed previous years. Most cotton fields across the country underwent plowing and turning of the soil last winter and this spring, and 86% of the cotton fields received base fertilizer. Due to the large-scale water conservancy projects undertaken last winter and this spring, the national irrigated cotton fields have expanded to account for 68% of the planned cotton sowing area, nearly half of which underwent winter or spring irrigation. High-yield demonstration plots arranged in various cotton regions account for 42% of the national cotton sowing area. Improved varieties have been completely popularized. Sowing density is higher than in previous years, generally reaching around 4,000 to 5,000 plants per mu. All of these situations are unprecedented in previous years.

In order to ensure full and robust seedlings, achieving a harvest for every mu sown, various localities, after basically completing the cotton sowing work, immediately launched a mass campaign of inspecting seedlings, replenishing seedlings, cultivating and applying fertilizer, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests. The Liaocheng Special District in Shandong Province has universally completed the work of inspecting and replenishing seedlings on four million mu of cotton. Recently, various parts of Henan Province have seized the opportunity of rainfall to launch a large-scale inspection and replenishment campaign to check the area, check seedling emergence, replenish the area, and replenish missing seedlings. In the Xinxiang Special District, all 1.4 million mu of cotton fields with missing seedlings have been replanted. In the three areas of Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding in Hebei Province, 80% of the 1.8 million mu of cotton fields with serious missing seedlings have been re-sown; more than half of the 2 million mu with fewer missing seedlings have also been replenished. Currently, the work of cultivating and weeding and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests in these three areas has also begun. In Shaanxi Province, more than 1.2 million mu of cotton fields have been cultivated and weeded, more than 770,000 mu have been inspected and replenished, and some areas have also carried out topdressing and thinning of seedlings.

    全国棉花播种任务完成90％以上
    各地大力查苗补苗加强棉田管理
    据新华社讯　我国各棉产区的棉花播种任务已经完成90％以上。其中80％的棉田已经出苗。目前，各地还在继续狠抓棉花播种的扫尾工作和突击播种麦茬棉，同时大力开展了以查苗补苗和查苗补种为中心的棉田初期管理运动。
    今年，我国各地棉花播种的时间一般比去年适当提前，播种质量也超过了往年。全国大部分棉田在去冬今春都经过耕翻，有86％的棉田施了底肥。由于去冬今春大兴水利，全国灌溉棉田已经发展到占全国棉花计划播种面积的68％，其中将近一半都进行了冬灌或春灌。各棉区安排的高额丰产田，占到全国棉花播种面积的42％。良种已经完全普及。播种密度比往年高，一般每亩达到四千株到五千株上下。以上这些情况，都是历年所没有的。
    为了保证苗全苗壮，做到播种一亩丰收一亩，各地在基本结束棉花播种工作以后，立即开展了查苗、补苗、中耕追肥和防治病虫害的群众运动。山东聊城专区四百万亩棉花已经普遍完成查苗补苗工作。河南各地最近抓紧下雨时机，掀起了查面积、查出苗、补面积、补缺苗的大查大补运动。新乡专区一百四十万亩有缺苗断垅现象的棉田已全部进行了补种。河北省邯郸、石家庄和保定三个地区缺苗严重的一百八十万亩棉田，已有80％经过重种；缺苗不多的二百多万亩，也已有一半以上经过补种。现在，这三个地区的中耕除草和防治病虫害的工作也已经开始。陕西省棉田已中耕除草一百二十多万亩，查苗补苗七十七万多亩，部分地区还进行了追肥间苗工作。
