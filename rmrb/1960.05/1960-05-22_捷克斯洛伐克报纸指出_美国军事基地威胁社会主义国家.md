    Czechoslovakian Newspaper Points Out
    American Military Bases Threaten Socialist Countries
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 20th. The Czechoslovakian "People's Defense Daily" wrote on the 20th that the entire system of American military bases only serves America's aggressive plans.
    "People's Defense Daily" draws people's attention specifically to American air force bases in foreign countries. The newspaper said that today, the United States already possesses military airfields, atomic weapon warehouses, rocket launch sites, and other auxiliary equipment in thirty countries. The newspaper, when discussing the incident of the American "Lockheed U-2" spy plane being shot down by the Soviet Union, pointed out that Britain, West Germany, Turkey, Pakistan, the Philippines, and other places all have this type of aircraft, thereby forming an encirclement of the socialist camp.
    "People's Defense Daily" emphasized that the existence and activities of these American military bases in foreign countries are not only a direct threat to world peace but also particularly threaten those countries that provide their territory to the United States for espionage and provocation activities.

    捷克斯洛伐克报纸指出
    美国军事基地威胁社会主义国家
    新华社布拉格20日电　捷克斯洛伐克“人民防线报”20日写道，美国的一整套军事基地制度只是为美国的侵略计划服务的。
    “人民防线报”提请人们特别注意美国在外国的空军基地。报纸说，今天，美国已经在三十个国家里拥有军用机场、原子武器仓库、火箭发射场和其他辅助设备。报纸谈到被苏联打下来的美国“洛克希德U—2”型间谍飞机事件时指出，英国、西德、土耳其、巴基斯坦、菲律宾和其他地方都有这种飞机，从而构成了对社会主义阵营的包围网。
    “人民防线报”强调说，美国在外国的这些军事基地的存在和活动，不仅是对世界和平的直接威胁，而且特别威胁着那些把自己的领土提供给美国作间谍和挑衅活动之用的国家。
