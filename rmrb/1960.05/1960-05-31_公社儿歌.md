Commune Children's Song

	My home is truly big
		My home is truly big, filled with thousands of blossoming trees, everyone lives in a garden, laughing happily.
		Thousands of trees in bloom, tens of thousands of trees in bloom, all are the happy flowers of the commune, under the flowers thousands of roads are built, every road leads to colorful clouds.
		To the east, a new factory stands, its production is top-notch; to the west, fat pigs are being raised, along with cattle, sheep, mules, horses, rabbits, bees, chickens, and ducks.
		To the south, under the flowers, is a school, where we all study hard; to the north, under the flowers, is a nursery, where the caretakers are watching the babies.
		We go to the canteen to eat together, the food is fragrant and sweet, praised by everyone; to speak of our service station, it is better than our own dear mother.
		My home is truly big, everyone is producing, everyone is learning, how wonderful is the People's Commune! We will always love it!

Flower Blooms, Ten Thousand Homes Red

	Zhang Cheng
		Red lanterns hang on the streets, drums thunder through the city, the city has realized communization, one flower blooms, ten thousand homes are red.
		Little sister learns to sing in the nursery, mother goes to work in the factory, auntie joins the service station, grandma steams buns in the canteen.
		In the evening, we go to study at the people's school, the streets are filled with singing and laughter.

Big Pig

	Wang Jinhua
		Wooden clapper, silver clapper, beat the bamboo clapper and sing a song, not singing of cattle and sheep filling the mountains, but only singing of the commune's big pig king.
		Big pig king, exceedingly fat, its back so high it touches the roof, its ears like big cattail leaf fans, its belly touching the ground like a wall.
		Grandpa says, it’s like a calf, grandma says, it’s like a small elephant, little sister laughs and chimes in: "The commune's fat pigs are all like this!"

Helping Mom with Work

		When I get home from school, I pick up my little iron shovel, run to the livestock farm, and help Mom with work:
		Feeding chickens, herding pigs, carrying dirt, lining pens.
		Singing songs, my hands are never idle, Mom praises me: "Exemplary little commune member."

    公社儿歌 我的家，真正大
    放　平我的家，真正大，家里开满了千树花，人人住在花园里，高高兴兴笑哈哈。千树花，万树花，都是公社的幸福花，花下修起了千条路，条条大路出彩霞。东边一片新工厂，厂里的生产顶呱呱；西边喂着大肥猪，还有牛、羊、骡、马、兔子、蜜
  蜂、鸡和鸭。南边花下是学校，我们学习得都不差；北边花下是托儿所，阿姨正在看娃娃。一起到食堂去吃饭，又香又甜人人夸；要说我们的服务所，赛过自己的亲妈妈。我的家，真正大，人人都生产，个个学文化，人民公社多么好！我们永远热爱它！花开一朵万家红
  张　诚大街上，挂红灯，满城锣鼓响咚咚，城市实现公社化，花开一朵万家红。妹妹托儿站里学唱歌，妈妈工厂去做工，婶婶参加服务站，奶奶食堂把馍蒸。夜晚民校去学习，满街歌声追笑声。
  大　猪　王金花棍，银花棒，打起竹板把歌唱，不唱牛羊满山跑，单唱公社的大猪王。大猪王，溜溜胖，脊梁高高顶了房，耳朵好似大蒲扇，肚皮挨地像堵墙。爷爷说，像牛犊，奶奶说，赛小象，妹妹笑着忙插嘴：“公社的肥猪都这样！”帮　妈　干　活放学回到家，拿起小铁锨，跑到畜牧场，帮妈把活干：喂鸡，赶猪，背土，垫圈。口里唱着歌，两手忙不闲，妈妈把我夸：“模范小社员。”
