Title: Not the Slightest "Misunderstanding"

The Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty signed by U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi group, due to its obvious aggressive nature, has not only aroused a surging wave of nationwide resistance from the Japanese people, but has also been severely condemned and resolutely opposed by peace-loving countries and people all over the world, especially China and the Soviet Union, which are the primary targets of its aggression. The Chinese government and people have repeatedly issued serious warnings to the U.S.-Japan reactionaries who are plotting new war conspiracies. The Chinese people have taken practical actions to firmly support the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. Since the 9th, more than 7 million people in 21 cities in our country, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Jinan, Nanchang, Xi'an, Changchun, LÃ¼da, Chengdu, Yinchuan, Lhasa, Chongqing, Taiyuan, Fushun, Hangzhou, Nanning, Xining, Wuhan, Nanjing, Lanzhou, and Kunming, have held grand rallies and demonstrations to support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle.

All this has produced a special "conditioned reflex" in Nobusuke Kishi. Nobusuke Kishi even nonsensically claimed in an interpellation at the Special Committee on Security Treaties of the Japanese House of Representatives on May 12 that "China and the Soviet Union do not fully understand the essence of the security treaty," and openly described the large-scale demonstrations by our people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty as "a manifestation of misunderstanding of the security treaty."

Is it really a "misunderstanding"? Is the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" a peace treaty, not a war treaty? Is it a treaty of friendship with the people of China, the Soviet Union, and all of Asia, rather than an aggressive military alliance that takes the people of China, the Soviet Union, and all of Asia as enemies, a military treaty that will drag the Japanese people into an atomic war and drive the Japanese people to serve as cannon fodder?

Let us look at the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" itself and how the Nobusuke Kishi clique interprets this treaty.

First, even from the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty itself, which is adorned with many beautiful words such as "peace" and "democracy," it is not difficult to see its aggressive nature. Article 3 of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty stipulates: "The Contracting Parties, individually and in cooperation with each other, by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, will maintain and develop their respective capacities to resist armed attack, subject to their constitutional provisions." This indicates that Japan will expand its militarist military strength. Moreover, Nobusuke Kishi has publicly announced more than once that Japan's possession of nuclear weapons "does not violate the constitution." This means that Japan's military expansion includes the implementation of nuclear armament. In accordance with the requirements of this clause, the Nobusuke Kishi government has already formulated the second six-year (1960-1965) arms expansion plan, including a "comprehensive strategy for joint U.S.-Japan operations," stipulating that "equipping missiles as a basic policy" is necessary and that nuclear armament must be vigorously carried out. The cost of arms expansion will increase to 290 billion yen in the final year of the plan, which is twice the current amount.

Second, the Japanese army armed with nuclear weapons is by no means for "resisting armed attacks," but for serving as an accomplice of the United States in launching aggressive wars in the Far East. The treaty stipulates that Japan will continue to provide military bases to the United States (Article 6), that the United States and Japan will jointly "take action" to deal with "armed attacks launched on either party in the territory under Japan's jurisdiction" (Article 5), and that "at the request of either party, consultations shall be held at any time when the security of Japan or the international peace and security of the Far East are threatened" (Article 4). Nobusuke Kishi and Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama have both publicly stated that, according to the new treaty, Japan will fight jointly with the United States. They have repeatedly declared: "An attack on U.S. forces stationed in Japan is an attack on Japan."

Third, Nobusuke Kishi also blatantly claimed in his reply to the Diet that Japan's "dispatch of troops abroad does not violate the constitution," that Japanese troops "can be dispatched on the high seas," and can be sent abroad to "attack enemy bases." May I ask, what is a treaty that requires joint operations and joint attacks if not an aggressive military alliance treaty? The applicable area of the treaty, that is, the scope of the so-called "Far East," is, according to Fujiyama Aiichiro's interpretation, "the area surrounding Japan, including the area north of the Philippines, the coast of China, and the Primorsky Krai (of the Soviet Union)"; U.S. officials mean "the entire East Asian region, from the Siberian coast southward through Japan, Korea, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, and the mainland countries of Southeast Asia, but excluding India and Pakistan" (United Press International dispatch, February 9). Fujiyama also blatantly clamored that U.S. troops could be dispatched to "the interior of China or the Soviet Union" and "could be dispatched to areas outside the Far East."

May I ask: Isn't such a Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty openly targeting China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries as its targets of aggression? Isn't it hostile to the people of these countries? There is absolutely no "misunderstanding" here, and there is absolutely no slightest "misunderstanding."

The aggressive purpose of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries in concluding the Japan-U.S. military alliance is not even denied by the U.S. side. The U.S. "New York Post" said that the result of the signing of this treaty is that "Japan may, with the assistance of the United States, have a strong military force" to "confront the military forces of the Soviet Union and China."

The U.S. "Nation" weekly wrote that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will increase the danger of Japan being involved in wars that the United States may have with third countries and requires Japan to equip its army with atomic weapons. Because the treaty "does not stipulate that the United States is not allowed to transport nuclear weapons, Japan may become a nuclear arsenal that is hit by hydrogen bombs in the event of war. Combined with the Vandenberg Resolution, this treaty requires any country that establishes a mutual assistance relationship with the United States to have sufficient military strength to engage in modern warfare, which can be interpreted as Japan must also become a nuclear country." May I ask, are these frank statements from the U.S. side also out of "misunderstanding"?

In fact, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' conspiracy to further plot new wars through the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty has long been well known. What's more, they themselves are constantly exposing themselves. Since this new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was signed, even though it has not yet been approved by the Japanese Diet, the Nobusuke Kishi government has stepped up its efforts to strengthen the militarist military force. Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama said at a meeting of the Senate on March 11 that Japan will rely on the new "Security Treaty" to continue expanding its military and preparing for war. According to figures released on the same day by Japanese "Defense Agency" Director-General Munenori Akagi, this year's Japanese military strength will generally approach the originally planned 1965 target, thereby accelerating the pace of arms expansion. As for the U.S.-Japan reactionaries colluding with each other to carry out aggressive activities hostile to China and the Soviet Union, especially military espionage activities, they are also stepping up. According to the "Akahata" newspaper, since Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States in 1958 and his secret talks with U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director Allen Dulles on the issue of cooperation between the Japanese and U.S. intelligence agencies, the Japanese intelligence agency has in fact become the Far East office of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. In addition to providing bases for U.S. "U-2" type reconnaissance aircraft; drawing up aviation maps including the territories of China and the Soviet Union based on information supplied by the United States; and hiring former Japanese soldiers to collect information about China and the Soviet Union in accordance with the so-called "basic labor contract" it signed with U.S. forces stationed in Japan. May I ask: Did the Nobusuke Kishi government do so many bad things out of "misunderstanding" of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"? Either Nobusuke Kishi faithfully implemented the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and did many good things for his American masters; or Nobusuke Kishi violated the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and did a lot of "stupid things." It seems that Nobusuke Kishi would not agree that he did "stupid things." Then, there is only one conclusion: these facts further prove that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is an aggressive military alliance treaty.

Nobusuke Kishi said that the Chinese "misunderstand," then what about the Japanese? Are the millions of Japanese people rising up to oppose the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"; unified action is not once, but has been held fifteen times, and will not stop, and is holding the sixteenth time; the number of participants is not less than once, but more and more, are all of these also out of "misunderstanding"?

If the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is really a good treaty, then how could it be so widely and resolutely opposed by people from all walks of life in Japan? If it were not for the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, which drove the Japanese people back to the road of war disaster, how could it have prompted Japanese Buddhists and Christians, who usually never cared about politics, to join the ranks of the struggle? May I ask Nobusuke Kishi: How do you explain this "misunderstanding"?

It seems that it is not others who "misunderstand," not the Chinese or the Japanese who "misunderstand." It is Nobusuke Kishi and his gang of reactionaries who misunderstand. They overestimate their own strength and underestimate the strength of the people. The Nobusuke Kishi clique thought that once the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was signed, everything would be fine, and no one could oppose it. If there is any trouble, a few sophistry words, such as "misunderstanding," can be used to prevaricate. If there are any demonstrations or strikes, batons, water cannons, tear gas, and even machine guns can be used to deal with them. Nobusuke Kishi and all reactionaries, including U.S. imperialism, have a common characteristic, which is also where they are unlucky, which is to underestimate the awakening of the people, underestimate the unity of the people, underestimate the strength of the people, and be superstitious about themselves, superstitious about the batons, machine guns, and even atomic bombs in their hands, superstitiousâor in Eisenhower's own words, "worship secrecy and concealment." This is one of the important reasons why they continue to fail and continue to suffer. The example before us is Syngman Rhee, who rode on the heads of the South Korean people for twelve years. Eisenhower, who sent planes to invade Soviet airspace, is also one. If Nobusuke Kishi continues to "misunderstand" in this way, he will never have a better ending than Syngman Rhee. Listen, the Japanese people are roaring! The death knell of Nobusuke Kishi has sounded! The death knell of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has sounded!
