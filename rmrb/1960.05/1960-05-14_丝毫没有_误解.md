The Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty signed by U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi group, due to its obvious aggressive nature, has not only aroused a surging wave of nationwide resistance from the Japanese people, but has also been severely condemned and resolutely opposed by peace-loving countries and people all over the world, especially China and the Soviet Union, which are the primary targets of its aggression. The Chinese government and people have repeatedly issued serious warnings to the U.S.-Japan reactionaries who are plotting new war conspiracies. The Chinese people have taken practical actions to firmly support the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. Since the 9th, more than 7 million people in 21 cities in our country, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Jinan, Nanchang, Xi'an, Changchun, Lüda, Chengdu, Yinchuan, Lhasa, Chongqing, Taiyuan, Fushun, Hangzhou, Nanning, Xining, Wuhan, Nanjing, Lanzhou, and Kunming, have held grand rallies and demonstrations to support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle.

All this has produced a special "conditioned reflex" in Nobusuke Kishi. Nobusuke Kishi even nonsensically claimed in an interpellation at the Special Committee on Security Treaties of the Japanese House of Representatives on May 12 that "China and the Soviet Union do not fully understand the essence of the security treaty," and openly described the large-scale demonstrations by our people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty as "a manifestation of misunderstanding of the security treaty."

Is it really a "misunderstanding"? Is the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" a peace treaty, not a war treaty? Is it a treaty of friendship with the people of China, the Soviet Union, and all of Asia, rather than an aggressive military alliance that takes the people of China, the Soviet Union, and all of Asia as enemies, a military treaty that will drag the Japanese people into an atomic war and drive the Japanese people to serve as cannon fodder?

Let us look at the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" itself and how the Nobusuke Kishi clique interprets this treaty.

First, even from the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty itself, which is adorned with many beautiful words such as "peace" and "democracy," it is not difficult to see its aggressive nature. Article 3 of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty stipulates: "The Contracting Parties, individually and in cooperation with each other, by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, will maintain and develop their respective capacities to resist armed attack, subject to their constitutional provisions." This indicates that Japan will expand its militarist military strength. Moreover, Nobusuke Kishi has publicly announced more than once that Japan's possession of nuclear weapons "does not violate the constitution." This means that Japan's military expansion includes the implementation of nuclear armament. In accordance with the requirements of this clause, the Nobusuke Kishi government has already formulated the second six-year (1960-1965) arms expansion plan, including a "comprehensive strategy for joint U.S.-Japan operations," stipulating that "equipping missiles as a basic policy" is necessary and that nuclear armament must be vigorously carried out. The cost of arms expansion will increase to 290 billion yen in the final year of the plan, which is twice the current amount.

Second, the Japanese army armed with nuclear weapons is by no means for "resisting armed attacks," but for serving as an accomplice of the United States in launching aggressive wars in the Far East. The treaty stipulates that Japan will continue to provide military bases to the United States (Article 6), that the United States and Japan will jointly "take action" to deal with "armed attacks launched on either party in the territory under Japan's jurisdiction" (Article 5), and that "at the request of either party, consultations shall be held at any time when the security of Japan or the international peace and security of the Far East are threatened" (Article 4). Nobusuke Kishi and Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama have both publicly stated that, according to the new treaty, Japan will fight jointly with the United States. They have repeatedly declared: "An attack on U.S. forces stationed in Japan is an attack on Japan."

Third, Nobusuke Kishi also blatantly claimed in his reply to the Diet that Japan's "dispatch of troops abroad does not violate the constitution," that Japanese troops "can be dispatched on the high seas," and can be sent abroad to "attack enemy bases." May I ask, what is a treaty that requires joint operations and joint attacks if not an aggressive military alliance treaty? The applicable area of the treaty, that is, the scope of the so-called "Far East," is, according to Fujiyama Aiichiro's interpretation, "the area surrounding Japan, including the area north of the Philippines, the coast of China, and the Primorsky Krai (of the Soviet Union)"; U.S. officials mean "the entire East Asian region, from the Siberian coast southward through Japan, Korea, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, and the mainland countries of Southeast Asia, but excluding India and Pakistan" (United Press International dispatch, February 9). Fujiyama also blatantly clamored that U.S. troops could be dispatched to "the interior of China or the Soviet Union" and "could be dispatched to areas outside the Far East."

May I ask: Isn't such a Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty openly targeting China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries as its targets of aggression? Isn't it hostile to the people of these countries? There is absolutely no "misunderstanding" here, and there is absolutely no slightest "misunderstanding."

The aggressive purpose of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries in concluding the Japan-U.S. military alliance is not even denied by the U.S. side. The U.S. "New York Post" said that the result of the signing of this treaty is that "Japan may, with the assistance of the United States, have a strong military force" to "confront the military forces of the Soviet Union and China."

The U.S. "Nation" weekly wrote that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will increase the danger of Japan being involved in wars that the United States may have with third countries and requires Japan to equip its army with atomic weapons. Because the treaty "does not stipulate that the United States is not allowed to transport nuclear weapons, Japan may become a nuclear arsenal that is hit by hydrogen bombs in the event of war. Combined with the Vandenberg Resolution, this treaty requires any country that establishes a mutual assistance relationship with the United States to have sufficient military strength to engage in modern warfare, which can be interpreted as Japan must also become a nuclear country." May I ask, are these frank statements from the U.S. side also out of "misunderstanding"?

In fact, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' conspiracy to further plot new wars through the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty has long been well known. What's more, they themselves are constantly exposing themselves. Since this new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was signed, even though it has not yet been approved by the Japanese Diet, the Nobusuke Kishi government has stepped up its efforts to strengthen the militarist military force. Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama said at a meeting of the Senate on March 11 that Japan will rely on the new "Security Treaty" to continue expanding its military and preparing for war. According to figures released on the same day by Japanese "Defense Agency" Director-General Munenori Akagi, this year's Japanese military strength will generally approach the originally planned 1965 target, thereby accelerating the pace of arms expansion. As for the U.S.-Japan reactionaries colluding with each other to carry out aggressive activities hostile to China and the Soviet Union, especially military espionage activities, they are also stepping up. According to the "Akahata" newspaper, since Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States in 1958 and his secret talks with U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director Allen Dulles on the issue of cooperation between the Japanese and U.S. intelligence agencies, the Japanese intelligence agency has in fact become the Far East office of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. In addition to providing bases for U.S. "U-2" type reconnaissance aircraft; drawing up aviation maps including the territories of China and the Soviet Union based on information supplied by the United States; and hiring former Japanese soldiers to collect information about China and the Soviet Union in accordance with the so-called "basic labor contract" it signed with U.S. forces stationed in Japan. May I ask: Did the Nobusuke Kishi government do so many bad things out of "misunderstanding" of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"? Either Nobusuke Kishi faithfully implemented the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and did many good things for his American masters; or Nobusuke Kishi violated the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and did a lot of "stupid things." It seems that Nobusuke Kishi would not agree that he did "stupid things." Then, there is only one conclusion: these facts further prove that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is an aggressive military alliance treaty.

Nobusuke Kishi said that the Chinese "misunderstand," then what about the Japanese? Are the millions of Japanese people rising up to oppose the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"; unified action is not once, but has been held fifteen times, and will not stop, and is holding the sixteenth time; the number of participants is not less than once, but more and more, are all of these also out of "misunderstanding"?

If the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is really a good treaty, then how could it be so widely and resolutely opposed by people from all walks of life in Japan? If it were not for the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, which drove the Japanese people back to the road of war disaster, how could it have prompted Japanese Buddhists and Christians, who usually never cared about politics, to join the ranks of the struggle? May I ask Nobusuke Kishi: How do you explain this "misunderstanding"?

It seems that it is not others who "misunderstand," not the Chinese or the Japanese who "misunderstand." It is Nobusuke Kishi and his gang of reactionaries who misunderstand. They overestimate their own strength and underestimate the strength of the people. The Nobusuke Kishi clique thought that once the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was signed, everything would be fine, and no one could oppose it. If there is any trouble, a few sophistry words, such as "misunderstanding," can be used to prevaricate. If there are any demonstrations or strikes, batons, water cannons, tear gas, and even machine guns can be used to deal with them. Nobusuke Kishi and all reactionaries, including U.S. imperialism, have a common characteristic, which is also where they are unlucky, which is to underestimate the awakening of the people, underestimate the unity of the people, underestimate the strength of the people, and be superstitious about themselves, superstitious about the batons, machine guns, and even atomic bombs in their hands, superstitious—or in Eisenhower's own words, "worship secrecy and concealment." This is one of the important reasons why they continue to fail and continue to suffer. The example before us is Syngman Rhee, who rode on the heads of the South Korean people for twelve years. Eisenhower, who sent planes to invade Soviet airspace, is also one. If Nobusuke Kishi continues to "misunderstand" in this way, he will never have a better ending than Syngman Rhee. Listen, the Japanese people are roaring! The death knell of Nobusuke Kishi has sounded! The death knell of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has sounded!

### 丝毫没有“误解”

    丝毫没有“误解”
    美帝国主义和岸信介集团签订的日美军事同盟条约，由于它明显的侵略性质，不仅激起日本人民汹涌澎湃的席卷全国的反抗怒潮，而且遭到全世界爱好和平的国家和人民、特别是为它的侵略矛头所首先指向的中国和苏联的严正谴责和坚决反对。中国政府和人民对策划新战争阴谋的美日反动派一再提出严重警告。中国人民以实际行动坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争。从9日开始，我国已有北京、天津、沈阳、济南、南昌、西安、长春、旅大、成都、银川、拉萨、重庆、太原、抚顺、杭州、南宁、西宁、武汉、南京、兰州、昆明等二十一个城市的七百多万人举行盛大集会和示威游行，支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。
    这一切在岸信介身上，却产生一种特殊的“条件反射”。岸信介竟然在5月12日日本众议院安全条约特别委员会的质询中胡说什么“中苏两国没有充分了解安全条约的本质”，并且公然把我国人民反对日美军事同盟条约的大示威说成“是对于安全条约的误解的表现”。
    真的是“误解”么？难道新的日美“安全条约”是个和平条约，而不是战争条约么？难道它是同中国、苏联和全亚洲人民友好的条约，而不是以中国、苏联和全亚洲人民为敌的侵略性的军事同盟，不是要把日本人民拖入原子战争、驱使日本人民充当炮灰的军事条约么？
    让我们来看看日美“安全条约”本身和岸信介之流怎样解释这个条约罢。
    第一，即使从用了不少“和平”、“民主”等漂亮词句来点缀的日美军事同盟条约本身，人们也不难看出它的侵略本质。日美军事同盟条约第三条规定：“缔约国将单独地和互相合作，通过继续不断的有效的自助和互助，以遵循各自宪法的规定为条件来维持和发展各自抵御武装进攻的能力。”这就表明了日本将扩充它的军国主义的军事力量。而且岸信介已经不止一次地公开宣布，日本拥有核武器“并不违反宪法”。这就是说，日本扩充军力包括实行核武装。岸信介政府根据这一条款的要求，已经拟订了包括“日美共同作战的综合战略”的第二个六年（1960—1965）扩军计划，规定以“装备导弹为基本方针”，要大力进行核武装。扩军的费用在计划最后一年要增加到二千九百亿日元，为现在的两倍。
    第二，用核武器武装起来的日本军队决不是为了什么“抵御武装进攻”，而是为了充当美国在远东发动侵略战争的帮凶。条约规定，日本要继续向美国提供军事基地（第六条），美日两国将共同“采取行动”对付“对于在日本管辖下的领土上对任何一方发动的武装进攻”（第五条），并且“在日本的安全或远东的国际和平和安全受到威胁的时候，应任何一方的请求随时进行协商”（第四条）。岸信介和外务相藤山爱一郎都公开表示，根据新条约，日本将和美国共同作战。他们已一再声明：“对驻日美军的进攻就是对日本的进攻”。
    第三，岸信介在国会答辩时还明目张胆地声称：日本“派兵出国并不违反宪法”，日本军队“可以在公海上出动”，可以派到国外去“进攻敌人的基地”。试问一个既要共同作战、又要共同进攻的条约，不是侵略性的军事同盟条约是什么？而条约的适用地区也就是它所说的“远东”的范围，根据藤山爱一郎的解释是“以菲律宾以北、中国的沿岸、（苏联）滨海边区等日本周围地区”；美国官员的意思是指“整个东亚地区，从西伯利亚海岸向南经过日本、朝鲜、中国、菲律宾、印度尼西亚和东南亚的大陆国家，但不包括印度和巴基斯坦”（合众国际社2月9日电讯）。藤山还露骨地叫嚷，美军可以出动到“中国的内地或苏联”、“可以出动到远东以外的地区”。
    试问：这样的日美军事同盟条约，难道不是公然以中国、苏联和亚洲各国为它的侵略对象么？难道不是同这些国家的人民为敌么？这里完全不是什么“误解”，也绝对没有丝毫“误解”。
    美日反动派缔结日美军事同盟的侵略目的，连美国方面也并不讳言。美国“纽约邮报”说，这项条约签订的结果是“日本可能在美国的援助下拥有强大的军事力量”，同“苏联和中国的军事力量对抗。”
    美国“民族”周刊写道，新的日美“安全条约”将使日本被卷入美国同第三国可能发生的战争危险性增加，要求日本用原子武器装备它的军队。由于条约“没有规定不许美国运入核武器，因此，日本可能成为一旦发生战争时遭到氢弹袭击的核军火库。这个条约同范登堡决议相结合，要求同美国建立互助关系的任何国家有足够的军事力量来从事现代战争，这可以解释为日本也必须成为一个核国家。”试问，难道美国方面的这些坦率的表白，也是出于“误解”吗？
    实际上，美日反动派通过日美军事同盟条约进一步策划新战争的阴谋，早已成为尽人皆知的了。何况它们自己还在不断进行自我揭露。自从这个新日美“安全条约”签订以后，尽管它还没有经日本国会批准，岸信介政府就加紧增强军国主义的军事力量。日本外务相藤山爱一郎在3月11日参议院的会议上说，日本要依靠新“安全条约”继续扩军备战。而根据日本“防卫厅”长官赤城宗德同一天发表的数字表明，今年度的日本军事力量将大体上接近原订的1965年度指标，从而加快了扩充军备的速度。至于美日反动派相互勾结，进行敌视中国和苏联的侵略活动，特别是军事谍报活动，也在加紧进行。据“赤旗报”揭露，自从1958年岸信介访问美国同美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯就日美情报机关合作的问题举行秘密会谈以来，日本情报机关事实上已经变成美国中央情报局的远东办事处。岸信介政府除了为美国“U—2”型侦察飞机提供基地；根据美国供给的资料绘制出包括中国苏联领土在内的航空地图；还根据它同驻日美军签订的所谓“劳务基本合同”替美军雇用日本旧军人，搜集有关中国和苏联的情报。试问：岸信介政府做了这许多坏事，难道也是出于对日美“安全条约”的“误解”吗？要么就是岸信介忠实地执行了日美“安全条约”，替他的美国主子做了许多好事；要么就是岸信介违反了日美“安全条约”，做了一大堆“蠢事”。看来岸信介是不会同意他做了“蠢事”的。那末，结论只有一个：这些事实进一步证明，日美“安全条约”是侵略性的军事同盟条约。
    岸信介说中国人“误解”，那末日本人又怎样呢？难道千千万万日本人民奋起反对日美“安全条约”；统一行动不是一次，而是已经举行了十五次，而且还不罢休，正在举行第十六次；参加人数不是一次比一次少，而是一次比一次多，难道所有这一切也都是出于“误解”吗？
    如果日美“安全条约”果真是个好条约，那末，它怎么会遭到日本各阶层人民的如此广泛的坚决的反对呢？如果不是日美军事同盟条约，把日本人民重新驱向战争灾难的道路，怎么会促使平时从来不过问政治的日本佛教徒和基督教徒也纷纷走进斗争的行列呢？请问岸信介：你是怎样来解释这种“误解”的呢？
    看来不是别人“误解”，不是中国人、日本人“误解”。误解的倒是岸信介和他的一伙反动派。他们高估了他们自己的力量，低估了人民的力量。岸信介之流自以为，日美“安全条约”一经签字，就万事大吉了，是谁也反对不了了。如果有什么麻烦，狡辩几句，用什么“误解”之类就可以搪塞过去的。如果有什么示威、罢工之类，警棍、水龙、催泪弹甚至机关枪就可以对付过去的。岸信介和一切反动派包括美帝国主义在内，有一个共同的特点，也是他们倒霉的地方，就在于低估了人民的觉醒，低估了人民的团结，低估了人民的力量，而迷信他们自己，迷信他们手里的警棍、机关枪以至原子弹，迷信——或者用艾森豪威尔自己的话来说，“崇拜保密和隐藏”。这是他们不断失败、不断吃苦头的重要原因之一。眼前的例子，曾经骑在南朝鲜人民头上十二年之久的李承晚就是一个。派飞机侵犯苏联领空的艾森豪威尔也是一个。岸信介这样“误解”下去，绝不会有比李承晚好一点的下场。听罢，日本人民在怒吼！岸信介的丧钟响了！日美“安全条约”的丧钟响了！
