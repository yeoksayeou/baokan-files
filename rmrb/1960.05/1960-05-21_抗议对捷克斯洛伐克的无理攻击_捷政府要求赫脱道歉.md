Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 18th: The Czechoslovak government has lodged a serious protest with the US government regarding US Secretary of State Herter's statement on May 9th, which referred to the so-called "forcible takeover of Czechoslovakia" by the Soviet Union. A memorandum was delivered by the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry to Thomas Dillon, the US Chargé d'Affaires in Prague, on May 18th.

The memorandum stated that Herter's remarks directly violate all international norms and are clearly an act of interference in Czechoslovakia's internal affairs. The Czechoslovak government considers this a manifestation of the notorious "Cold War" policy.

The memorandum listed facts illustrating the hostile treatment of the Czechoslovak people by the United States and other Western imperialist countries throughout history. The memorandum condemned Herter's statement as distorting these historical facts and as an insult to the Czechoslovak people made on Czechoslovakia's National Day.

The memorandum pointed out that all of this, as well as recent developments in international affairs, make it difficult to believe that the US authorities' assurances of "US concern for easing international tensions and improving relations with the Czechoslovak Republic" are sincere.

The memorandum concluded by noting that this attitude of the United States is incompatible with the fact that the United States maintains diplomatic relations with Czechoslovakia, and it hopes that the US Secretary of State will issue an appropriate apology.

    抗议对捷克斯洛伐克的无理攻击
    捷政府要求赫脱道歉
    新华社布拉格18日电　捷克斯洛伐克政府就美国国务卿赫脱5月9日在一篇声明中讲到所谓苏联“武力接管捷克斯洛伐克”一事，向美国政府提出严重抗议。一份备忘录已由捷克斯洛伐克外交部于18日交给了美国驻布拉格代办托马斯·狄龙。
    这份备忘录说，赫脱的谈话直接违反一切国际惯例，并且显然是干涉捷克斯洛伐克内政的行为。捷克斯洛伐克政府认为，这是臭名昭彰的“冷战”政策的一种表现。
    备忘录列举事实，说明美国以及西方其他帝国主义国家在历史上对待捷克斯洛伐克人民的敌意的作法，备忘录谴责说，赫脱的声明歪曲了这些历史事实，并且是在捷克斯洛伐克国庆日说出的侮辱捷克斯洛伐克人民的话。
    备忘录指出，这一切以及最近国际事态的发展，使人们很难相信美国当局所谓“美国关心缓和国际紧张局势和改善同捷克斯洛伐克共和国的关系”的保证是有诚意的。
    备忘录最后促请注意，美国的这种态度是跟美国同捷克斯洛伐克保持外交关系的事实不相容的，它盼望美国国务卿作出适当的道歉。
