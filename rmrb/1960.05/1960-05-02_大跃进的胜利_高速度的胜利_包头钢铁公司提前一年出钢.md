    The Victory of the Great Leap Forward, the Victory of High Speed
    Baotou Iron and Steel Company Produces Steel One Year Ahead of Schedule
    Enters a New Stage of Inner Mongolia's Industrial Construction, Adds Fresh Troops to China's Iron and Steel Front
    Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 1st – Following the production of iron one year ahead of schedule, the Baotou Iron and Steel Company has now produced steel one year ahead of schedule, just seven months later.
    At 8:25 PM today, the first furnace of steel flowed from Baotou Steel's No. 1 giant open-hearth furnace, announcing the birth of a powerful new force on China's iron and steel front and declaring that the history of the iron and steel industry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has entered a new stage of rapid development.
    The No. 1 giant open-hearth furnace began charging at 6:00 AM this morning. When the temperature of the molten steel in the furnace rose to 1600 degrees Celsius and passed the sampling test, Shi Xiugui, director of the open-hearth furnace workshop and smelting foreman, immediately ordered the tapping of the steel. At this time, an assistant, Communist Party member Bao Lizhao, along with other Mongolian and Han workers, under the command of Mongolian steelworker (i.e., furnace chief) Alatan Bagen, quickly opened the taphole, and the first furnace of molten steel surged out, sparks flying, and the people watching the tapping burst into cheers.
    The molten steel flowed for more than thirty minutes. Mongolian crane operator and Communist Party member Bao Jinshan, operating the 350-ton ingot crane, lowered the large iron hook and lifted away the steel trough; in a short while, he roared the crane back and lifted the 270-ton ingot mold, quickly casting the molten steel into steel ingots.
    Among those who witnessed the steel production today were Su Qianyi, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China (also First Secretary of the Baotou Municipal Committee of the CPC), Kui Bi, and other party and government leaders from Baotou City and Baotou Steel. Soviet experts led by Klukov also witnessed the steel production.
    Baotou Steel's No. 1 giant open-hearth furnace was designed with the assistance of the Soviet Union and is one of China's current "kings of open-hearth furnaces." It adopts new technologies such as oxygen steelmaking and evaporative cooling, and implements automated operation and two-trough tapping. Auxiliary projects, such as batching, charging, ingot casting, ingot stripping, and mold preparation, are also highly mechanized and automated.
    From pouring the foundation to the completion of all its dozens of projects, this large open-hearth furnace and its associated projects took only five months and five days in calendar time, and the actual effective construction time was less than four months, making it the fastest open-hearth furnace construction period in China today.
    In order to ensure the high-speed construction of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace, the Baotou Iron and Steel Company Committee of the Communist Party of China resolutely implemented the policy of concentrating forces to ensure key points. In coordinated operations, workers of all trades chased each other, competed with each other, helped each other, and created conditions for each other, fully promoting the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and the spirit of great collaboration.
    The construction of Baotou Steel's No. 1 open-hearth furnace received support from more than 290 factories and enterprises across the country. At the same time, Soviet experts also made important contributions to Baotou Steel's early steel production.

### 大跃进的胜利　高速度的胜利  包头钢铁公司提前一年出钢

    大跃进的胜利　高速度的胜利
    包头钢铁公司提前一年出钢
    使内蒙古工业建设进入新阶段　为我国钢铁战线增加生力军
    据新华社包头1日电　包头钢铁公司在提前一年出铁之后的七个月，又提前一年出钢了。
    今天下午八点二十五分，包钢一号巨型平炉流出了第一炉钢水，宣告我国钢铁战线上又诞生了一支强大的生力军，宣告内蒙古自治区的钢铁工业历史从此进入了一个飞跃发展的新阶段。
    一号巨型平炉在今天早晨六时开始装料。当炉内钢水温度上升到一千六百度，经取样化验合格以后，平炉车间主任兼冶炼工长石修贵马上命令打点出钢。这时候，一助手、共产党员包力召同其他蒙古族和汉族工人一道，在蒙古族炼钢工（即炉长）阿拉坦巴根的指挥下，迅速打开出钢口，第一炉钢水随即奔腾而出，钢花四溅，参观出钢的人们顿时欢腾起来。
    钢水流注了三十多分钟。操纵着三百五十吨铸锭吊车的蒙古族运转手、共产党员包金山降下大铁钩，吊走了出钢槽；不一会儿，又把吊车轰??地开回来，吊起二百七十吨的钢锭模，很快把钢水铸成了钢锭。
    参观今天出钢的，有中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记苏谦益（兼中共包头市委第一书记）、奎璧和包头市、包钢等党政负责人。以克鲁克里柯夫为首的苏联专家们，也参观了出钢。
    包钢一号巨型平炉是苏联帮助我国设计的，是我国目前几座“平炉之王”之一。它采用了氧气炼钢、汽化冷却等新技术，实行自动化操作和两槽出钢。辅助工程，如配料、上料、铸锭、脱锭、整模等，也都是高度机械化和自动化的。
    这座大平炉及其所属的几十项工程，从浇灌基础到全部建成，日历工期只用了五个月零五天，而实际有效工期还不到四个月，是当前我国平炉建设工期最快的。
    中共包头钢铁公司委员会为了保证高速度建成一号平炉，坚决贯彻了集中兵力保证重点的方针。各工种工人在协同作战中，你追我赶，互相竞赛又互相帮助，互相创造条件，充分发扬了敢想敢干风格和大协作精神。
    包钢一号平炉的建设，得到了全国各地二百九十多个工厂企业的支援。同时，苏联专家也为包钢提前出钢作出了重要贡献。
