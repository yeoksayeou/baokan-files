Xinhua News Agency, May 8th: This reporter reports: Storm clouds gather over Japan, and the Japanese people's movement against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" surges forward, heading towards a new climax.

    The struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is a reflection of Japan's national contradictions, and this struggle has become the center uniting various struggles of all classes of the Japanese people. Because the Kishi Nobusuke group, at the request of the United States, attempts to rely on the majority of seats of the ruling party to force the Diet to approve this aggressive military treaty that betrays national interests, the struggle is now at an extremely acute juncture.

    The Japanese people clearly recognize that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" concluded by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries is a military alliance for aggression in Asia. It allows Japanese militarism, which was overthrown by the people of the world fifteen years ago, to raise its head again, and makes Japan once again a source of war in the East. This will not only bring profound disasters to the Japanese nation, but also pose a serious threat to peace and security in Asia.

    Therefore, since the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries proposed revising the "Security Treaty" in September 1958, the Japanese people, led by the working class, have launched struggles against the revision and demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" through various means such as rallies, strikes, and demonstrations. Now, this struggle has lasted for one year and eight months. The number of people participating in the struggle is increasing, the participating classes are widening, and the momentum of the struggle is growing. The flames of struggle have spread throughout Japan's four major islands. The duration, scale, unity, and organization of the struggle are unprecedented in Japanese history.

    In the initial stage, the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty" was carried out separately by various political parties and mass organizations. However, in the struggle, people from all walks of life in Japan clearly recognized the importance of unity and joint struggle. In March of last year, the Japanese Communist Party, Socialist Party, General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, Federation of Independent Unions, National Federation of Farmers' Associations, as well as 140 national organizations from youth, students, women, peace, international friendship, and small and medium-sized enterprises jointly formed the "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty." Since then, the struggle has entered a higher stage of joint struggle with unified leadership. Under the leadership of the National Council, the Japanese people have launched fifteen national unified actions that shook Japan and caused a worldwide sensation since April 15th of last year, resolutely opposing the revision and demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The cumulative number of participants in the fifteen unified actions reached 50 million.

    Fearing the continuous growth of the people's strength, the Kishi Nobusuke government and monopoly capital have adopted vicious methods such as bloody suppression and internal division in an attempt to weaken the people's ranks and undermine the people's struggle. They beat and arrested demonstrators and petitioners, searched and threatened actively struggling trade unions and mass organizations, and instigated divisionists to squeeze out the Communist Party and split the Socialist Party and trade unions.

    However, the Japanese people's answer to them is: more resolute struggle, more extensive unity. The participants in each unified action rapidly increased from the initial hundreds of thousands to millions, reaching seven million in the fifteenth unified action. In addition to the unified actions, the Japanese people also held a national demonstration against the "Security Treaty" with ten million participants. Despite the persecution by the Kishi Nobusuke government, the number of people who signed petitions against the Diet's approval of the new "Security Treaty" has reached 6.5 million. The Japanese Diet has received more than five million petitions against the approval of the new "Security Treaty." Even many capitalist groups and local councils have issued statements or passed resolutions opposing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Some enlightened people within the Japanese ruling party are also worried about the obligations that Kishi Nobusuke will bear after revising the "Security Treaty" and the possible consequences of establishing a Japan-U.S. military alliance. The movement against the "Security Treaty" has developed into a nationwide struggle.

    The Japanese people's heroic and unyielding struggle has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and made an important contribution to the cause of peace in Asia. They disrupted the enemy's timetable and postponed the signing of the new "Security Treaty" by more than a year. Recently, the Japanese people also smashed the Kishi Nobusuke group's conspiracy to force the House of Representatives to approve the new "Security Treaty" before April 26.

    In order to thwart the Kishi Nobusuke group's new conspiracy to extend the Diet session and forcibly pass this treaty before U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan on June 19, the Japanese people have decided to launch an even more powerful sixteenth unified action from May 9 to 26. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan has decided to hold a nationwide general strike. Encouraged by the favorable situation at home and abroad, the Japanese people's struggle has recently further developed into a struggle aimed at preventing the Diet from approving the new "Security Treaty," demanding the dissolution of the Diet, and overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, dealing an even heavier blow to the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries.

### 日本人民反对“安全条约”的斗争进入新高潮

    日本人民反对“安全条约”的斗争进入新高潮
    据新华社8日讯　本社记者报道：日本海上风聚云涌，日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的运动汹涌澎湃，正在推向新的高潮。
    反对日美“安全条约”的斗争是日本的民族矛盾的反映，这个斗争已经成为汇集日本各阶层人民各种斗争的中心。由于岸信介集团根据美国的要求企图依仗执政党多数议席强使国会批准这项侵略性的和出卖民族利益的军事条约，斗争现在正处于极其尖锐的关头。
    日本人民清楚地认识到：美日反动派缔结的新日美“安全条约”是侵略亚洲的军事同盟，它使曾经在十五年前被全世界人民打倒的日本军国主义重新抬头，使日本再度成为东方的战争策源地。这不仅将给日本民族带来深重的灾难，而且将给亚洲的和平和安全造成严重的威胁。
    因此，日本人民从美日反动派在1958年9月提出修改“安全条约”时起就以工人阶级为主举行大会、罢工、示威游行等各种方式展开了反对修改和要求废除日美“安全条约”的斗争。现在，这一斗争已经持续了一年零八个多月，参加斗争的人数越来越多，参加斗争的阶层越来越广，斗争的声势越来越大。斗争的烽火燃遍整个日本四大岛。斗争时间之久、规模之大和斗争的统一性和组织性都是日本历史上空前未有的。
    日本人民反对“安全条约”的斗争在初期还是由各个政党和群众团体分散进行的。但是，在斗争中日本各界人民清楚认识到团结一致、联合斗争的重要性。去年3月，日本共产党、社会党和日本工会总评议会、中立工会联合会、全日本农民协会联合会以及青年、学生、妇女、和平、国际友好、中小企业等各界一百四十个全国性团体联合组成了“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”。从此，斗争进入了有统一领导的联合斗争的更高阶段。在国民会议的领导下，日本人民从去年4月15日起先后展开了十五次震撼日本、轰动世界的全国性统一行动，坚决反对修改和要求废除日美“安全条约”。参加十五次统一行动的人数累计达到五千万人。
    由于害怕人民力量的不断壮大，岸信介政府和垄断资本曾经采取了血腥镇压和内部分化等毒辣的手段，企图削弱人民的队伍，破坏人民的斗争。它们殴打和逮捕示威请愿群众，搜查和威胁积极斗争的工会和群众团体，并且策动分裂主义者排挤共产党，分裂社会党和工会。
    但是，日本人民对它们的回答是：更坚决的斗争，更广泛的团结。每次统一行动的参加者以最初的几十万迅速增加为数百万，到十五次统一行动达到了七百万。除了统一行动外，日本人民还举行了一千万人参加的反对“安全条约”全国大游行。不顾岸信介政府的迫害、签名反对国会批准新“安全条约”的人数已经达到六百五十万。日本国会收到了五百多万份反对批准新“安全条约”的请愿书。甚至许多资本家的团体和地方议会也发表声明或通过决议，反对日美“安全条约”。日本执政党内一些有识之士也对岸信介修改“安全条约”后所将承担的义务以及建立日美军事同盟所可能带来的后果感到忧虑。反对“安全条约”的运动已经发展为全民性的斗争。
    日本人民的英勇不屈的斗争已经给予美日反动派以沉重的打击，对亚洲的和平事业作出了重要的贡献。他们打乱了敌人的时间表，把签订新“安全条约”的时间推迟了一年多。最近日本人民又粉碎了岸信介集团在4月26日以前强使国会众议院批准新“安全条约”的阴谋。
    为了粉碎岸信介集团延长国会会期在美国总统艾森豪威尔6月19日访问日本以前强行通过这个条约的新阴谋，日本人民决定从5月9日至26日展开更加强大的第十六次统一行动。日本工会总评议会已经决定要举行全国性总罢工。在国内外有利形势的鼓舞下，日本人民的斗争最近已经进一步发展为以阻止国会批准新“安全条约”、要求解散国会、打倒岸信介内阁为目标的斗争，更加沉重地打击着美日反动派。
