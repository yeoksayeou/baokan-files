Xinhua News Agency, May 25th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Central Executive Committee of the Japan Socialist Party held a meeting today and decided to launch a nationwide movement demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet, and to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

The meeting decided to mobilize its various local organizations to submit opinions to the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Diet expressing these demands.

At its meeting on the 24th, the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party also decided that all Socialist Party Diet members would return to their constituencies after May 27th to call on voters to demand the collective resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the dissolution of the Diet.

Socialist Party Diet members will return to Tokyo in early June to assist the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) in its planned nationwide general strike on June 4th.

In addition, the Democratic Socialist Party agreed on the 24th to accept the Socialist Party's proposal for a joint struggle between the two parties to force the Kishi Nobusuke government to dissolve the Diet. This agreement was reached by Koichi Yamamoto, Chairman of the Socialist Party Diet Policy Committee, and Kazuyuki Kasuga, Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party Diet Policy Committee.

The Democratic Socialist Party held a meeting of Diet members today and decided to completely abstain from any deliberations in the Diet from the 27th and to launch a movement in various regions demanding the resignation of the Kishi cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

Xinhua News Agency, May 24th, Tokyo Dispatch: At a press conference held on the 24th, Asanuma Inejiro, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, vehemently criticized Kishi Nobusuke, demanding the total resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the dissolution of the Diet before June 18th.

Asanuma said: As the person in charge of the Pacific War, Kishi Nobusuke brought the police into the Diet and forcibly "voted" on the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." This is a manifestation of fascist politics. "The Kishi Nobusuke cabinet has trampled on democratic politics and destroyed the parliamentary system. It is only natural for it to step down."

Asanuma explained the situation of the Japanese people's mass demonstrations demanding Kishi Nobusuke's resignation and the dissolution of the Diet, and emphasized that there is only one way out at present: "That is, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet should resign en masse and dissolve the Diet before June 18th to consult the people on whether to approve the new Security Treaty."

Asanuma criticized Kishi Nobusuke's remarks that he would neither dissolve the Diet nor resign en masse. Asanuma said that the Socialist Party will continue to refuse deliberations in the House of Councillors, just as it did in the House of Representatives, and will launch mass movements outside the Diet to severely attack the privileged and arrogant Prime Minister Kishi until he steps down and achieves dissolution, without taking a single step back.

He said that the Socialist Party will also hold traveling speeches in various places, and the trade unions will take the largest-scale actions to force Kishi Nobusuke to step down and dissolve the Diet.

He said: "The current struggle is a struggle by the Japanese people for peace and complete independence." He called on all those who are concerned about Japan's future to join the ranks of the battle.

He also said that the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling party are demanding a three-party summit to "clean up the mess," but "holding a meeting is not possible unless an agreement is reached on the issues of Kishi Nobusuke's resignation, the dissolution of the Diet, and preventing the ratification of the Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, May 25th, Tokyo Dispatch: Asanuma Inejiro, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, once again condemned U.S. imperialism late on the 24th for imposing its military needs on Japan, dividing Korea and Vietnam, occupying Taiwan, and occupying Okinawa. He said that this is the essence of U.S. imperialism.

Asanuma made these remarks in refuting the statement issued by the U.S. Embassy following the argument between U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II and Asanuma on the same day.

Speaking to reporters, Asanuma emphasized that the Japanese Constitution stipulates that Japan is not allowed to rearm, provide military bases to foreign countries, or form military alliances with other countries.

Asanuma refuted the statement issued by the U.S. Embassy, which slandered Asanuma's request to cancel Eisenhower's visit to Japan and his meeting with Douglas MacArthur II as being for "propaganda." However, Asanuma said, "There is ample reason to suspect that the Ambassador himself took this unprecedented action of issuing a statement on Japan's internal affairs" in order to "support the Kishi Nobusuke government."

Asanuma reiterated that Eisenhower's visit to Japan would not help promote friendship between Japan and the United States.

    日本社会党决定在全国展开倒岸运动
    浅沼发表谈话猛烈抨击岸信介的法西斯手段
    再次谴责美国在日本和亚洲的帝国主义政策
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本社会党中央执行委员会今天举行会议，决定要在全国范围内掀起要求岸信介内阁总辞职和解散国会以及阻止批准新“安全条约”的运动。
    会议决定发动它的各个地方组织向岸信介政府和国会提出表示这种要求的意见书。
    社会党中央执行委员会在24日的会议上还决定，社会党的全体国会议员在5月27日以后回到他们的选区去，呼吁选民要求岸信介政府集体辞职并解散国会。
    社会党的国会议员将在6月初回到东京，以便协助日本工会总评议会预定在6月4日举行的全国总罢工。
    另外，民主社会党24日同意接受社会党提出的两党进行联合斗争以迫使岸信介政府解散国会的建议。这项协议是由社会党国会对策委员会委员长山本幸一和民主社会党国会对策委员会委员长春日一幸达成的。
    民主社会党今天举行国会议员会议，决定从27日起完全不参加国会的任何审议，并在各地展开要求岸内阁下台和解散国会的运动。
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎在24日举行的记者招待会上猛烈抨击岸信介，要求岸信介政府总辞职，并在6月18日以前解散国会。
    浅沼说：作为太平洋战争的负责人岸信介把警察召入国会，强行“表决”新日美“安全条约”，这是法西斯政治的表现。“岸信介内阁已经践踏了民主政治，破坏了议会制度，下台是理所当然的。”
    浅沼说明日本人民群众示威，要求岸信介下台、解散国会的形势后强调说，当前的出路只有一条，“那就是，岸信介内阁实行总辞职，在6月18日以前解散国会，征询国民是否批准新安全条约。”
    浅沼抨击了岸信介关于既不解散国会，也不实行总辞职的谈话。浅沼说，社会党在参议院将像在众议院一样，继续坚持拒绝审议，在国会外面展开群众运动，对特权骄横的岸首相大加痛击，直到他下台和实现解散的时候为止，决不退让一步。
    他说，社会党还将在各地举行旅行演说，并由工会采取最大规模的行动，迫使岸信介不得不下台和解散国会。
    他说：“目前的斗争是日本国民要求和平和完全独立的斗争。”他呼吁一切忧虑日本前途的人们参加到战斗的行列中来。
    他并且说，岸信介政府和执政党要求举行三党首脑会谈来“收拾局面”，但是“如果不在岸信介下台、解散国会、阻止批准安全条约的问题上达成协议，举行会谈也是不行的。”
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎24日深夜再一次谴责美帝国主义把军事需要强加于日本，分裂朝鲜和越南，霸占台湾和霸占冲绳。他说，这是美帝国主义的实质。
    浅沼是在驳斥美国大使馆就当天美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二同浅沼争论以后所发表的声明时讲这番话的。
    浅沼在对记者讲话时强调说，日本宪法规定，日本不许重新武装，向外国提供军事基地或同其他国家结成军事同盟。
    浅沼驳斥了美国驻日本大使馆所发表的声明，这项声明诬蔑浅沼要求取消艾森豪威尔访问日本以及他同麦克阿瑟第二会面是为了“进行宣传”。但是，浅沼说，“有充分的理由可以怀疑，大使本人采取了这种就日本内政发表声明的史无前例的行动”是为了“支持岸信介政府”。
    浅沼重申，艾森豪威尔访问日本将不会有助于促进日本和美国的友谊。
