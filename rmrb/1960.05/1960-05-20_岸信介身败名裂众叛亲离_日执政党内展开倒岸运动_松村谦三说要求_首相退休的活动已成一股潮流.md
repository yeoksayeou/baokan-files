Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th Dispatch: As the Japanese people's struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke group over the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" intensifies, the anti-Kishi movement within Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party is also developing.

According to today's "Asahi Shimbun" report, representatives from six of the ruling party's eight factions held a meeting last night to jointly discuss how to force Kishi Nobusuke to step down. These six factions are the Miki-Matsumura faction, the Ishibashi faction, the Kono faction, the Ohno faction, the Ishii faction, and the Ikeda faction. The only factions not participating in the meeting were the Kishi Nobusuke faction and the Sato faction, headed by Kishi Nobusuke's younger brother, Sato Eisaku.

According to reports, the representative of the Miki-Matsumura faction said at the meeting that before the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is ratified, preparations should be made within the party to prevent Kishi Nobusuke from being elected president of the Liberal Democratic Party for a third consecutive term. If possible, the six factions should firmly support a jointly nominated presidential candidate.

At the meeting, some also put forward a strong proposal, saying that the movement to prevent Kishi Nobusuke from being elected president for a third term should be combined with countermeasures surrounding the Diet's deliberation of the new "Security Treaty."

The Japanese Liberal Democratic Party is scheduled to hold a presidential election in January next year. According to Liberal Democratic Party convention, the person elected president of the party while it is in power concurrently serves as prime minister and organizes the cabinet. Due to the conclusion of an aggressive military alliance treaty with the United States, the Kishi Nobusuke group has become increasingly unpopular and has been met with increasingly widespread opposition from the people. Recently, anti-Kishi activities within the ruling party have also become increasingly active. Starting from their own different interests, each faction unanimously opposes Kishi Nobusuke's third consecutive term as president of the ruling party, demanding that Kishi Nobusuke "retire." To this end, various factions have held gatherings to unite anti-Kishi forces. Takeo Miki, one of the leaders of the Miki-Matsumura faction, once publicly proposed that a new budget should be drawn up by the new president in the fall of this year. Kenzo Matsumura said, "The movement demanding Prime Minister Kishi's retirement has become a trend," and "If Prime Minister Kishi is re-elected for a third term, great chaos will occur."

However, on the other hand, the Kishi Nobusuke group is doing everything possible to use bribery and co-option tactics to influence some factions within the Liberal Democratic Party in order to get the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty approved in the Diet. According to the Associated Press, some anti-Kishi factions have indicated that they would assist Kishi Nobusuke in passing the new treaty in the Diet in exchange for Kishi Nobusuke's resignation.

    岸信介身败名裂众叛亲离
    日执政党内展开倒岸运动
    松村谦三说要求“首相退休的活动已成一股潮流”
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：随着日本人民同岸信介集团围绕新日美“安全条约”问题展开的斗争日益激烈，日本执政党自由民主党内部的倒岸运动也在发展。
    据“朝日新闻”今天报道，在执政党的八个派系中有六个派系的代表昨天晚上举行集会，共同商讨如何把岸信介赶下台的问题。这六派是三木—松村派、石桥派、河野派、大野派、石井派、池田派。没有参加这次会议的只有岸信介派和以岸信介的胞弟佐藤荣作为首的佐藤派。
    据报道，三木—松村派的代表在会上说，应该在新日美“安全条约”批准以前，在党内作好部署，阻止岸信介三次连任自由民主党总裁。如果可能的话，应该在六派之间坚决支持联合提名的总裁候选人。
    在会上，还有人提出强硬的主张说，应当把阻止岸信介三次当选总裁的运动同围绕国会审议新“安全条约”的对策结合起来。
    日本自由民主党预定在明年1月进行总裁选举。按照自由民主党惯例，在它执政时当选党内总裁的人兼任首相，组织内阁。由于同美国缔结侵略性军事同盟条约，岸信介集团已越来越不得人心，并遭到日益广泛的人民的反对，最近执政党内的反岸活动也日益活跃起来。各派从各自不同的利益出发，一致反对岸信介第三次连任执政党总裁，要求岸信介“退休”。为此，各派系纷纷举行集会集结反岸力量。三木—松村派的首脑之一三木武夫曾经公开提出要在今年秋天由新总裁编制新预算的主张。松村谦三说：“要求岸首相退休的活动已经成为一股潮流”，“假若岸首相蝉联三任总裁的话，就会发生很大的混乱”。
    但是，另一方面，岸信介集团为了使日美军事同盟条约在国会中获得批准，千方百计地对自由民主党内一些派系施用利诱、拉拢手段。据美联社透露，有一些反岸派曾经表示要以岸信介辞职为代价，协助岸信介在国会中通过新条约。
