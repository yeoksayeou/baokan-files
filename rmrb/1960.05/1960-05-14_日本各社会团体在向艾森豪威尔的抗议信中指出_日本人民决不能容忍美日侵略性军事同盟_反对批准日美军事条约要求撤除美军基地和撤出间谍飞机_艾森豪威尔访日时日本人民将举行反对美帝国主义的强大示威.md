Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th - Tokyo News: Six representatives of the Japanese "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" delivered a letter of protest to the US Ambassador to Japan this morning, sent by the "National Council" to the US President, opposing the conclusion of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty."

In the letter, the "National Council" represented more than 140 member groups and seven million members of more than 2,000 joint struggle organizations nationwide, protesting against the US and Nobusuke Kishi group concluding this aggressive military treaty and demanding that the US Congress not ratify this treaty.

In the letter, the "National Council" also demanded that the United States return Okinawa to Japan, and withdraw military bases and American troops from Japan, and immediately withdraw all U-2 and other aircraft engaged in espionage activities from Japan.

The letter emphasized that this is the desire of all Japanese people who long for peace, independence, democracy and neutrality. The "National Council" requested the US President to respond to the above points.

The letter said that no matter how hard the US and Japanese governments try to promote the purpose of the new "Security Treaty" as "maintaining peace" and based on the principle of "US-Japan equality," this fallacy cannot convince the Japanese people.

The letter pointed out that, as exposed in the Japanese Diet meetings, the purpose of this treaty is to conspire to aggress against neighboring countries headed by China and the Soviet Union, and it is an aggressive military alliance treaty that forces Japan to assume new military obligations.

The letter mentioned the fact that three American U-2 aircraft stationed at Japanese bases are collecting intelligence on China and the Soviet Union, and pointed out that this is an intolerable act that violates Japanese law, negates international law, and ignores the will of the Japanese people.

The "National Council" emphasized in the letter that the new "Security Treaty" infringes on Japan's sovereignty and national dignity, violates the basic interests of Asian countries, and the Japanese people will never allow the ratification of this treaty. The Japanese people's struggle against the ratification of this treaty is getting higher and higher, and the support of the people of Asia for the struggle is becoming more and more enthusiastic, which is justified.

The six representatives who delivered the letter of protest to the US Embassy included Hirozo Minakuchi, Secretary-General of the "National Council," Jukio Iwadare, Deputy Secretary-General, and Ichizo Suzuki, member of the Central Cadre Committee of the Japanese Communist Party. Twenty representatives of the Fukuoka Prefecture Joint Struggle Organization, who had just arrived in Tokyo this morning, also accompanied the representatives to the US Embassy to protest.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th - Tokyo News: Ten organizations, including the Japan Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the National Liaison Conference Against Military Bases, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, have decided to hold mass rallies during US President Eisenhower's visit to Japan to demand that the United States return Okinawa to Japan.

The preparatory committee for this mass rally was established in Tokyo on May 10. The committee is scheduled to hold another meeting on May 16 to decide on the date and other details of this mass rally.

Tsuyoshi Toki, the representative of the Japanese Communist Party, emphasized the importance of this rally at the first preparatory committee meeting. He said that this rally should be a powerful demonstration by the Japanese people against the US imperialists. He emphasized that this rally should demand: the abolition of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty", the withdrawal of all American bases from Japan, and the immediate return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan.

    日本各社会团体在向艾森豪威尔的抗议信中指出
    日本人民决不能容忍美日侵略性军事同盟
    反对批准日美军事条约要求撤除美军基地和撤出间谍飞机
    艾森豪威尔访日时日本人民将举行反对美帝国主义的强大示威
    据新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”六位代表今天上午向美国驻日大使馆递交了“国民会议”寄给美国总统的一封反对缔结新日美“安全条约”的抗议信。
    “国民会议”在信中代表一百四十多个会员团体和全国两千多个共同斗争组织的七百万会员，抗议美国同岸信介集团缔结这项侵略性的军事条约，并要求美国国会不要批准这项条约。
    “国民会议”在信中还要求美国把冲绳岛归还日本，并从日本撤除军事基地和撤出美军，立即从日本撤出U—2型等一切从事间谍活动的飞机。
    信中强调指出，这是渴望和平、独立、民主和中立的全体日本人民的意愿。“国民会议”要求美国总统就上述几点作出答复。
    信中说，无论美、日政府怎样竭力宣传新“安全条约”的目的在于“维护和平”和根据“日美平等”的原则，但是这种谬论不能使日本人民相信。
    信中指出，正如在日本国会会议上所暴露的，这项条约的目的在于阴谋侵略以中苏为首的邻近各国，并且是强使日本承担新的军事义务的侵略性军事同盟条约。
    信中提到三架美国U—2型飞机驻在日本基地收集中苏情报的事实，并且指出，这是违反日本法律和否定国际法、忽视日本人民意志的不可容忍的行为。
      “国民会议”在信中强调指出，新“安全条约”侵犯日本主权和国家尊严，违背亚洲各国的基本利益，日本人民绝不能容许批准这项条约。日本人民反对批准这项条约的斗争越来越高涨，全亚洲人民对斗争的支持也越来越热烈，这是理所当然的。
    到美国大使馆递交这封抗议信的六位代表中包括“国民会议”事务局长水口宏三、副事务局长岩垂寿喜男和日本共产党中央干部会委员铃木市藏。今天上午刚到达东京的福冈县共同斗争组织的代表二十人也随同代表到美国大使馆去进行抗议。
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本社会党、共产党、全国反对军事基地联络会议和日本工会总评议会等十个组织决定在美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本期间，举行群众大会要求美国把冲绳岛归还日本。
    这次群众大会的筹备委员会已于5月10日在东京成立。委员会预定在5月16日再举行会议，决定这一群众大会的日期和其他细节。
    日本共产党代表土岐强在第一次筹备委员会会议上强调这次集会的重要性。他说，这次大会应该是日本人民反对美帝国主义者的一次强大的示威。他强调说，这次大会应该要求：废除新日美“安全条约”，从日本撤消所有的美国基地，立即把冲绳和小笠原群岛归还日本。
