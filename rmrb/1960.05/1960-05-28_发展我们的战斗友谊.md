A Letter Sent to Japan

    Develop Our Fighting Friendship
    Yang Hansheng

    Dear Mr. Kenzo Nakajima, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association:
    Time flies so fast; it has been a year since we parted in Beijing. Our meeting in Beijing last summer left a deep impression on me. Especially at the lecture meeting held by our Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, you delivered a speech condemning the Kishida Nobusuke clique's policy of hostility toward China, and at the same time expressed your sincere friendship towards the Chinese people. Your firm attitude of clearly distinguishing between love and hate is something I cannot forget.
    A year has passed, and I still remember that you emphasized in your speech at that time that "The Kishida Nobusuke government will not change its policy to improve Sino-Japanese relations. The current issue is not to demand that the Kishida Nobusuke government change its policy, but to overthrow Kishida Nobusuke!" The Japanese people's struggle over the past year has fully confirmed the correctness of your assessment. Recently, the Kishida Nobusuke clique has intensified its efforts to actively promote the United States' war policy and hostile policy toward China. After U.S. imperialism sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference, he coordinated with U.S. imperialism's arms expansion and war preparations, intensifying the criminal activities of creating international tension, and adopted fascist violence to forcibly "pass" the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, attempting to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism and determined to drag the Japanese people into the abyss of disaster. For Japanese people with lofty ideals, if U.S. imperialism and the Kishida Nobusuke reactionary clique are not overthrown, Japan's independence and democracy cannot be achieved, and the peace of Asia and the world will suffer severe damage. Therefore, I am very excited that when the Japanese people's struggle is developing magnificently, wave after wave, I can hear you roaring loudly in an interview with a reporter from the "Japan News" weekly on the 21st of this month: "The Kishida Nobusuke clique's actions are illegal. The Japanese people will never accept this decision. We must overthrow the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet immediately." Your powerful voice expresses the firm will of millions of Japanese cultural figures, and also expresses the firm determination of more than 90 million Japanese people. With such heroic fighting spirit and unwavering determination, we firmly believe that the U.S. imperialism and the Kishida Nobusuke reactionary clique's delusion of extinguishing the flames of the Japanese people's struggle will not only fail to materialize, but ultimately, the flames of struggle that the Japanese people have fiercely ignited will burn the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to ashes!
    In the past year of struggle, what has made me especially happy is that I have seen Japanese cultural figures consistently and firmly throwing themselves into the ranks of the Japanese people's great anti-American patriotic struggle, standing with the broad masses of the people, and carrying out unyielding and heroic struggles. The revolutionary heroic spirit shown by the warriors of the Japanese cultural circles in this struggle has deeply moved us. I also remember very clearly that last year, on a clear morning when you were leaving Beijing to return to your country, when I said goodbye to you at the Beijing East Suburb Airport, you mentioned to me that many Japanese intellectuals actively participated in demonstrations and parades. In just this not-so-long period of one year, the struggle in the Japanese cultural circles has undergone profound changes. In the struggle against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, the broad masses of Japanese cultural figures have closely united with the broad masses of the people, sharing weal and woe, and becoming closely related!
    The Kishida Nobusuke clique's formation of an aggressive military alliance with U.S. imperialism, attempting to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism, not only concerns the fate of the Japanese people, but also concerns the peace of Asia and the world. The Chinese people and the Asian people, who have suffered miserably from the trampling of Japanese militarism, absolutely cannot allow the revival of Japanese militarism. Therefore, the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality is by no means isolated. It receives the full support of the Chinese people and the people of the world. Chairman Mao said when he met with Japanese friends visiting our country on May 14: "The Japanese people are very promising. The Chinese people have firmly supported, are firmly supporting, and will firmly support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle." This is the unwavering will of the 650 million Chinese people. The people of China and Japan should encourage and support each other forever in this common struggle. The friendship between the people of China and Japan is no longer an ordinary friendship, but a fighting friendship established in the common struggle. We should vigorously develop this fighting friendship.
    We are both cultural workers and are engaged in promoting friendly cooperation and cultural exchange between the people of China and Japan. Therefore, whenever we see the smooth development of every item of cultural exchange between our two peoples, we are very happy, and we regard it as a symbol of the development of this fighting friendship. Since you and I issued the "Joint Statement on Cultural Exchange between the People of China and Japan" in Beijing last June, the cultural exchange between our two peoples has become more substantive. There is no doubt that in the joint struggle against our common enemy, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, the cultural exchange between the people of China and Japan will have broad prospects for development. Let us hold hands tightly and strive for our great common struggle to move from one victory to another!

### 发展我们的战斗友谊

专栏：寄到日本去的信

    发展我们的战斗友谊
    阳翰笙亲爱的日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏先生：
    时间过得真快，我们在北京分手已经一年了。去年的夏天，我们在北京的会见，给我留下了深刻的印象。特别是在我们对外文化协会举行的讲演会上，您发表谴责岸信介集团敌视中国的政策，同时又表达了您对中国人民的真挚的友谊，您这种爱憎分明的坚定态度，是使我难以忘怀的。
    一年过去了，我还记得您当时在讲演会上曾经很强调地指出过“岸信介政府不会改变政策来改善中日关系的，现在的问题，不是要求岸信介政府如何改变政策，而是应该打倒岸信介！”一年来日本人民的斗争，完全证实了您这估计的正确。最近，岸信介集团更变本加厉地积极推行美国的战争政策和敌视中国的政策。在美帝国主义破坏了四国首脑会议之后，他策应美帝国主义扩军备战加紧制造国际紧张局势的罪恶活动，采取了法西斯暴力手段，强行“通过”日美军事同盟条约，妄图加速复活日本军国主义，决心把日本人民拖入灾难的深渊。这对日本有志之士来说，美国帝国主义和岸信介反动集团如不打倒，日本的独立和民主，便无法取得，亚洲和全世界的和平，便要遭受到严重的破坏。因此，我非常兴奋，当日本人民的斗争，正在波澜壮阔地，一浪高过一浪地开展着的时候，我能听到您在本月21日对“日本新闻”周报记者发表谈话时，大声地怒吼着：“岸信介集团的做法是非法的，日本人民绝不会接受这项决定，我们必须立即推翻岸信介内阁。”您这种强有力的声音，表达了千千万万个日本文化界人士的坚强意志，也表达了九千多万日本人民的坚定决心。你们有了这种英雄的斗志和坚定不移的决心，我们深信美帝国主义和岸信介反动集团，妄图扑灭日本人民斗争火焰的妄想，不但不能实现，归根结底，日本人民猛烈地燃烧起来了的斗争火焰，一定会把日美反动派烧个一干二净！
    在这一年来的战斗中，使我特别高兴的是我看到了日本文化界人士始终坚定地投身到日本人民这一伟大的反美爱国斗争的行列中，和广大的人民群众在一起，进行着不屈不挠的英勇的斗争。日本文化界的战士们在这个斗争中所表现出来的革命英雄气概，使我们深为感动。我还很清楚地记得，去年在您离开北京返国的一个清晨，当我同您在北京的东郊机场话别的时候，您曾对我说起过日本不少知识分子积极参加示威游行的情况。仅在这不算长的一年的时间中，日本文化界的斗争就已起了深刻的变化。广大的日本文化界人士在反对美日反动派的斗争中，已经紧密地同广大的人民群众，患难与共血肉相关地结合在一起了！
    岸信介集团与美帝国主义结成侵略性的军事联盟，妄图加速复活日本军国主义，这不仅关系到日本人民的命运，而且也关系到亚洲和世界的和平，中国人民和亚洲人民曾经惨遭日本军国主义的蹂躏，绝对不能容许日本军国主义复活。因此，日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约，争取独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争绝对不是孤立的，它得到中国人民和全世界人民的全力支援。毛主席在5月14日接见正在我国访问的日本朋友时曾说：“日本人民是很有希望的。中国人民过去、现在和将来都坚决支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。”这就是六亿五千万中国人民的坚定不移的意志，中日两国人民应该在这个共同斗争中永远互相鼓励、互相支持，中日两国人民的友谊，已经不是一般的友谊，而是在共同斗争中建立起来的战斗友谊了，我们应该大力地来发展这种战斗的友谊。
    我们都是文化工作者，都是从事促进中日两国人民间的友好合作和文化交流工作的人。因此，每当我们看到我们两国人民间的文化交流的每一个项目得到顺利发展的时候，我们都十分高兴，我们把它看作是这种战斗友谊的发展的标志。自从去年6月间您和我在北京发表了“关于中日两国人民间文化交流的联合声明”以来，我们两国人民的文化交流更加具有新的内容，毫无疑问，在反对我们的共同敌人美日反动派的联合斗争中，中日两国人民的文化交流将有着广阔的发展前途。让我们紧紧地握起手来，争取我们伟大的共同斗争从一个胜利走向另一个胜利吧！
