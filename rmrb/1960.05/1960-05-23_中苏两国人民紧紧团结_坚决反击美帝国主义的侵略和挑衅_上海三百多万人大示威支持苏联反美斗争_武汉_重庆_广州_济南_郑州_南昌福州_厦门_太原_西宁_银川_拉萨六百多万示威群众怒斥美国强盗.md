    Six Million Demonstration Participants in Wuhan, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Jinan, Zhengzhou, Nanchang, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Taiyuan, Xining, Yinchuan, and Lhasa Angrily Denounce American Bandits
    Incensed by the crimes of U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocations against the Soviet Union and its sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference, the Chinese people continue to hold demonstrations and rallies. In addition to the previously reported over 12 million people in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Anshan, Xi'an, Harbin, Changsha, Chengdu, and Hefei holding unprecedentedly massive demonstrations, on the 21st and 22nd, another nine million people in thirteen cities, including Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Guangzhou, held powerful demonstrations.
    In these cities, everyone turned out, and the shouts of slogans from the demonstration队伍队伍 were earth-shattering. The people's anger at the new aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism reached its climax. The numbers of participants in the demonstrations and rallies were: Shanghai, over three million; Wuhan, 1.5 million; Chongqing, 1.5 million; Guangzhou, over 800,000; Jinan, 520,000; Zhengzhou, 350,000; Nanchang, 330,000; Taiyuan, 300,000; Fuzhou, 300,000; Xiamen, 180,000; Xining, 200,000; Yinchuan, over 80,000; and Lhasa, 35,000. Party and government leaders in various regions, leaders of local organizations of democratic parties, and leaders of various people's organizations all participated in the conferences and spoke at the meetings, resolutely supporting the Soviet Union's solemn position on the Four-Power Conference and its just struggle against American aggression.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 22nd. Enraged by the banditry of U.S. imperialism, the people of Shanghai held an unprecedentedly massive demonstration and rally today with over three million participants, supporting the Soviet government's solemn stance against the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism and sternly condemning U.S. imperialism for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.
    The broad masses of the people of Shanghai expressed great indignation at U.S. imperialism's sending of spy planes to invade Soviet airspace and shamelessly sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference. In recent days, factories, government offices, schools, shops, neighborhoods, suburban people's communes, and military units have held rallies, condemning the serious crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against the Soviet Union and the people of the world. Today, the people's anger reached its climax. The entire city turned out en masse, and batches of demonstration队伍队伍 began to take to the streets from noon onwards, with militiamen carrying guns and workers carrying huge banners and cartoons. People marched shoulder to shoulder, holding high red flags, and converged in a mighty torrent on the People's Square in the central district. On Nanjing Road, Xizang Road, Yan'an Road, and other major thoroughfares around the square, the demonstration队伍队伍 stretched as far as the eye could see for dozens of miles. Slogans resounded through the sky: "Oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocations against the Soviet Union!" "Oppose U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference!" "Oppose the U.S. conspiracy to revive West German and Japanese militarism and plan a new war!" "People of the world, unite, strengthen the struggle against the imperialist war forces headed by the United States, and defend world peace!"
    Centered on the People's Square, all factories, government offices, schools, shops, hospitals, neighborhoods, and the Shanghai-based units of the army, navy, and air force held simultaneous demonstrations and rallies this afternoon. Red flags fluttered in the People's Square, and there was a sea of people. Huge slogans were hung on both sides of the rostrum and on the high-rise buildings around the square. Many of the cartoon boards in the mass队伍队伍 depicted the people of China, the Soviet Union, and the world together raising their fists and waving clubs to beat the American wolves who dared to commit aggression; others depicted the giant hand of the Soviet people tightly gripping the claws of the American aggressors. Militiamen, armed with light and heavy weapons, stood majestically at the forefront of the demonstrating masses. Among the militia队伍队伍 was Li Zengxiang, a driver from the Shanghai Gas Company militia who had been awarded a first-class merit for shooting down a B-26 American plane with a rifle on the Korean battlefield several years ago. He said angrily: Aggression against the Soviet Union is aggression against our country. If the American bandits are not reconciled to their defeat on the Korean battlefield and launch another war, we will certainly not spare them. Paralleling the militia队伍队伍 was the队伍队伍 of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai. Together with the demonstrating masses, they shouted slogans over and over again, and the entire venue was filled with a strong atmosphere of hatred for the enemy.
    At 4 p.m., the Shanghai people's rally to support the Soviet Union's just stance and oppose U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference began.
    The rally was presided over by Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai.
    Chen Pixian, Wei Wenbo, Ma Tianshui, and alternate secretary Liu Shuzhou, Secretaries of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China; Song Richang, Song Jiwen, Jin Zhonghua, Zhao Zukang, and Sheng Pihua, Deputy Mayors of Shanghai; Hu Juewen, Chen Wangdao, Shen Tilan, and Liu Jingji, Vice-Chairmen of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Lieutenant General Kang Zhiqiang and Major General Xiong Yingtang, leaders of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai; leaders of various departments of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee; and leaders of the local organizations of various democratic parties in Shanghai, various people's organizations, and prominent figures from all walks of life attended today's meeting.
    The Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, Yelishavigin, Soviet experts, and Soviet friends currently visiting Shanghai attended the meeting.
    Consuls General, consuls, and consular staff of various fraternal countries stationed in Shanghai also attended the meeting.
    Chen Pixian, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. The entire venue erupted in a storm of applause.
    In his speech, Chen Pixian sternly condemned the serious crimes of U.S. imperialism in carrying out blatant aggression and provocations against the Soviet Union and deliberately sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference. He said: The people of Shanghai, like the people of the whole country, fully support the Soviet Union's solemn position on the Four-Power Summit Conference and fully support the Soviet Union's just struggle against American aggression and provocations.
    Chen Pixian said: The people of the world can see very clearly that this serious crime committed by the U.S. reactionary ruling clique, headed by Eisenhower, against the cause of world peace is the result of the aggressive and warlike policy pursued by the U.S. government for a long time. U.S. imperialism is the most aggressive imperialism and the most ferocious enemy of world peace. This nature of it has never changed. He said that U.S. imperialism, with the support of British and French imperialism, brazenly sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference, once again nakedly exposing the ferocious features of U.S. imperialism's determination to be an enemy of the world's people and actively prepare for wars of aggression. It also exposed that Eisenhower is by no means a "peace envoy," but a downright bandit chieftain, the number one war monger. There is also a group of people who pretend to be "impartial," confuse right and wrong, and even slander the Soviet Union for "making a fuss over a minor issue," attempting to impose unfounded charges on the victim of aggression. These hypocrites who pretend to be "impartial" are true running dogs of imperialism.
    He said: U.S. imperialism's frantic provocations against the Soviet Union and its brazen sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference cannot save its fate of failure and decline, but will only arouse greater anger from the people of the world, further strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, and accelerate the death of U.S. imperialism.
    In his speech, Chen Pixian also strongly condemned the ugly behavior of U.S. imperialism in instigating the Nobusuke Kishi traitorous clique to use violence in the Japanese House of Representatives to illegally force through the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. He said that the world's people are becoming more and more aware day by day, and the united front against imperialist struggle is becoming stronger and stronger day by day. The lifespan of U.S. imperialism will not be very long.
    Chen Pixian's speech was constantly interrupted by the masses' storm of applause and shouts of slogans. People raised their arms and shouted: "People of the world, unite and overthrow U.S. imperialism!" "Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union!" "Long live the great unity of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism!"
    Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, Yelishavigin, spoke amid the enthusiastic applause of the masses. He said: During the years of growth of the Soviet state, the Soviet people have seen many threats, intimidations, and dirty provocations organized by imperialists against us. The result of all this is that all provocateurs, supporters, and implementers of the "policy of strength" have suffered a shameful failure without exception. On May 1 this year, the United States sent spy planes to invade Soviet airspace, and U.S. officials issued shameless statements, carrying out unprecedentedly despicable provocations. But the result was that they made a complete fool of themselves in front of the people of the world. U.S. imperialism has exposed its weakness but is still howling madly. If the American imperialist lords launch a war, they will definitely receive a counterattack that not only they themselves but also their children and grandchildren will never forget. The masses warmly welcomed Yelishavigin's speech with slogans and applause.
    Representatives of local organizations of various democratic parties in Shanghai, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, various people's organizations, and workers and farmers also spoke at the meeting.
    Sheng Pihua, representative of local organizations of various democratic parties in Shanghai, condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism in carrying out aggressive provocations against the Soviet Union and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference. He said that all members of the Shanghai local organizations of various democratic parties will certainly stand together with the people of the whole country and persevere in the struggle to completely defeat the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism.
    Jin Zhonghua, Chairman of the Shanghai branch of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, said that if we want to defend world peace, we must wage a persistent struggle against U.S. imperialism. He said that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is a powerful fortress for defending world peace. China and the Soviet Union will always unite together to fight together against imperialist aggression and safeguard world peace.
    Zhong Min, representing various people's organizations in Shanghai, said that the arrogant and domineering, blatant and brazen banditry of U.S. imperialism has aroused great indignation among the people of the world and has also aroused the incomparable anger of all the people of Shanghai. We firmly support the Soviet Union's solemn position against American aggression and provocations.
    Ying Zhongfa, national advanced producer and worker of the state-owned No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory, said passionately: We Shanghai workers firmly support the Soviet Union's solemn position. If U.S. imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression, we will join hands with all peace-loving people in the world and smash it to pieces with iron fists.
    Yin A'mei, national March 8th Red Banner Holder and female tractor driver, said: U.S. imperialism has exhausted its good words and done all the bad things. It speaks honey but carries a knife in its waist. Now it has reached the end of its evil deeds. If it is really tired of living and dares to launch a war of aggression, we will send it to the grave.
    Foreign friends from twenty countries who are visiting Shanghai all attended today's meeting. Together with the Chinese people, they supported the Soviet Union's just position and opposed U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference. Masao Komori, Deputy Head of the Japanese General Council of Trade Unions visiting delegation, said: Today's meeting embodies the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and it is also a great encouragement to the Japanese people to continue their struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. He excitedly told reporters that he had participated in five mass rallies during his visit to China and felt that the Chinese people strongly supported the Japanese people, which strengthened the confidence and courage of the Japanese people in carrying out the struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke clique. Feso Paul, a member of the Cameroon Youth Delegation, told reporters: U.S. imperialism has sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference. It is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world. It is engaged in aggression everywhere. Now the people of the world have risen up to oppose it, and its lifespan will not be long. We deeply feel that the Chinese people are the closest friends of all people who oppose colonialism and strive for freedom.
    The meeting ended amid the masses' passionate shouts of slogans. Dozens of balloons with huge slogans floated into the air from the mass队伍队伍. At this time, people sang songs such as "Unity is Strength," "The Hearts of the People of the World are United," and "Chinese People's Volunteer Army March," and held demonstrations in different directions. The masses who were scattered in thousands of factories, government offices, schools, shops, and neighborhoods throughout the city also formed队伍队伍 and took to the streets. The streets and alleys of the city were full of demonstrating masses, and angry slogans resounded everywhere. People shouted: "People of the world, unite and overthrow U.S. imperialism!"

    新华社上海22日电　被美帝国主义的强盗行为激怒了的上海人民，今天举行三百多万人的声势空前浩大的示威和集会，支持苏联政府对美帝国主义侵略罪行的严正立场，严厉谴责美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议。
    上海广大人民对美帝国主义派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空，无耻地破坏四国首脑会议，表示极大的愤慨。连日来，各工厂、机关、学校、商店、里弄、郊区人民公社和部队，纷纷举行集会，斥责美帝国主义对苏联和世界人民犯下的严重罪行。今天，人们的愤怒情绪达到了最高潮。全市万人空巷，一批批的示威队伍从中午开始就走向街头，民兵们背着枪，工人们抬着巨幅标语牌和漫画。人们肩并肩，高举红旗，浩浩荡荡地向中心区的人民广场汇集。广场四周的南京路、西藏路、延安路一带几十里长的通衢大道上，示威队伍一眼望不到尽头。口号声震天动地：“反对美帝国主义对苏联的侵略和挑衅！”“反对美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议！”“反对美国复活西德和日本军国主义、策划新战争的阴谋！”“全世界人民团结起来，加强斗争，反对以美国为首的帝国主义战争势力，保卫世界和平！”
    以人民广场为中心，全市所有的工厂、机关、学校、商店、医院、里弄和陆、海、空三军驻沪部队下午同时举行示威和集会。人民广场上红旗翻卷，人山人海。主席台两旁和广场四周的高楼大厦上，都挂着巨幅大字标语。群众队伍中的许多幅漫画牌上，有的画着中国、苏联和全世界人民一起高举拳头、挥动木棍、痛打胆敢进行侵略的美国狼；有的画着苏联人民的巨掌紧紧揪住了美国侵略者的魔爪。民兵们带着轻重武器，威武地站在示威群众的最前列。在民兵队伍里，有一位几年前在朝鲜战场上用步枪击落B—26型美机一架因而荣立一等功的司机、上海煤气公司民兵李增祥。他愤怒地说：对苏联的侵略就是对我国的侵略，美国强盗要是不甘心在朝鲜战场的失败，再发起战争，我们一定不会饶恕它。同民兵队伍并列的是人民解放军驻上海部队的队伍，他们同示威群众一起，一遍又一遍地高呼口号，整个会场充满了强烈的敌忾同仇的气氛。
    下午四时，上海各界人民支持苏联正义立场、反对美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议大会开始。
    大会由中共上海市委书记处书记、上海市副市长曹荻秋主持。
    中共上海市委书记处书记陈丕显、魏文伯、马天水、候补书记刘述周，上海市副市长宋日昌、宋季文、金仲华、赵祖康、盛丕华，政协上海市委员会副主席胡厥文、陈望道、沈体兰、刘靖基，中国人民解放军驻沪部队首长康志强中将、熊应堂少将，中共上海市委、上海市人民委员会各部门的负责人，以及各民主党派上海市地方组织、各人民团体的负责人和各界著名人士参加了今天的大会。
    苏联驻沪总领事叶里沙维金、苏联专家以及正在上海访问的苏联友人都参加了大会。
    参加大会的还有各兄弟国家驻沪总领事、领事和领事馆人员。
    中共上海市委书记处书记陈丕显在大会上讲话。全场响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    陈丕显在讲话中严厉谴责美帝国主义对苏联进行明目张胆的侵略和挑衅，蓄意破坏四国首脑会议的严重罪行。他说：上海人民同全国人民一样，完全拥护苏联对四国首脑会议所采取的严正立场，完全支持苏联反对美国侵略和挑衅的正义斗争。
    陈丕显说：全世界人民都看得很清楚：以艾森豪威尔为首的美国反动统治集团对世界和平事业所犯下的这种严重罪行，是美国政府长期奉行的侵略政策和战争政策的结果。美帝国主义是最富侵略性的帝国主义，是世界和平最凶恶的敌人，它的这种本性从来没有改变。他说：美帝国主义在英法帝国主义的支持下，悍然破坏了四国首脑会议，再一次赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义坚决与世界人民为敌，积极准备侵略战争的凶相，也暴露了艾森豪威尔决不是什么“和平使者”，而是地地道道的强盗头子，天字第一号的战争贩子。还有一伙人，伪装“公正”，混淆是非，甚至诽谤苏联“小题大做”，妄图把莫须有的罪名强加在被侵略者的头上。这些冒充“公正”的伪善者，是名副其实的帝国主义走狗。
    他说：美帝国主义疯狂地向苏联挑衅，悍然破坏四国首脑会议，并不能挽救它的失败和没落的命运，而只会激起全世界人民更大的愤怒，更加加强反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争，加速美帝国主义的死亡。
    陈丕显在讲话中，还强烈地谴责了美帝国主义嗾使岸信介卖国集团在日本众议院使用暴力，非法强行通过日美军事同盟条约的丑恶行为。他说，现在世界人民的觉悟一天比一天提高，反对帝国主义斗争的统一战线一天比一天更加壮大，美帝国主义的寿命不会很长了。
    陈丕显的讲话，不断被群众的暴风雨般的掌声和口号声打断。人们振臂高呼：“全世界人民团结起来，打倒美国帝国主义！”中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！”“亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民反帝国主义、反殖民主义大团结万岁！”
    苏联驻上海总领事叶里沙维金在群众的热烈掌声中讲话。他说：在苏维埃国家成长的年代里，苏联人民见到了不少由帝国主义者组织的针对我们的威胁、恐吓和肮脏的挑衅，而这一切的结果是所有的挑衅者、“实力政策”的拥护者和执行者都毫无例外地遭到了可耻的失败。今年5月1日，美国派遣间谍飞机侵入苏联领空，美国官方人士发出无耻的声明，进行了史无前例的卑鄙的挑衅，但是结果是他们在全世界人民面前出尽了丑。美帝国主义暴露了他们的虚弱，但是还在疯狂叫嚣。假如美帝国主义老爷们发动战争的话，他们一定会得到那种不仅他们自己甚至他们的子子孙孙也永远不会忘记的回击。群众用口号和掌声，热烈欢迎叶里沙维金的讲话。
    各民主党派上海市地方组织、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会上海市分会、各人民团体以及工人、农民的代表，都在大会上讲了话。
    各民主党派上海市地方组织代表盛丕华在讲话中谴责美帝国主义对苏联进行侵略挑衅和破坏四国首脑会议的罪行。他说，各民主党派上海地方组织的全体成员一定和全国人民一道，永远同苏联人民站在一起，为彻底击败美帝国主义的侵略政策而坚持不懈地斗争到底。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会上海市分会主席金仲华说，我们要保卫世界和平，必须对美帝国主义进行坚持不懈的斗争。他说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营是保卫世界和平的强大堡垒，中苏两国将永远团结在一起，为反对帝国主义的侵略、维护世界和平而共同战斗。
    钟民代表上海各人民团体讲话说，美帝国主义蛮横霸道、明目张胆的强盗行为，引起了全世界人民的极大愤慨，也激起了全上海人民的无比愤怒。我们坚决支持苏联反对美国侵略和挑衅的严正立场。
    全国先进生产者、国营第二纺织机械厂工人应忠发激昂地说：我们上海工人坚决支持苏联的严正立场。如果美帝国主义胆敢发动侵略战争，我们将和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，用铁拳打得它粉身碎骨。
    全国三八红旗手、女拖拉机手尹阿妹说：美帝国主义好话讲尽，坏事作绝，嘴里讲出糖来，腰里摸出刀来，现在它已经恶贯满盈。如果它真正活得不耐烦，胆敢发动侵略战争，我们就把它送进坟墓。
    正在上海访问的二十个国家的外国朋友都参加了今天的大会，他们和中国人民一起支持苏联正义立场，反对美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议。日本工会总评议会访华代表团副团长小森正夫说：今天大会体现了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结一致，同时对日本人民继续开展反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争也是很大的鼓舞。他兴奋地向记者表示，他在中国访问期间参加了五次群众集会，感到中国人民强有力地支持着日本人民，使日本人民开展反对美帝国主义和岸信介集团的斗争中增强了信心和勇气。喀麦隆青年代表团团员费索·保尔对记者说：美帝国主义破坏了四国首脑会议，它是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，它到处搞侵略，现在全世界人民都起来反对它，它的寿命不长了。我们深深地感到中国人民是一切反对殖民主义、争取自由的人民的最亲密的朋友。
    大会在群众激昂的口号声中结束。几十个挂着巨幅标语的气球从群众队伍中腾空而起。这时，人们高唱着“团结就是力量”、“全世界人民心一条”、“中国人民志愿军战歌”等歌曲，分路举行了示威游行。分散在全市成千上万个工厂、机关、学校、商店、里弄中举行集会的群众，也结队走上街头。全市大街小巷到处是示威的群众，到处是愤怒的口号声。人们高呼：“全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！”（附图片）
