Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Electric News Shanghai is concentrating its efforts on consolidating, promoting and improving the results of technological innovation. Many factories have adopted the method of innovating a batch, consolidating a batch, promoting a batch, improving a batch, and then innovating again, consolidating again, promoting again, and improving again, so that a large number of new equipment, new processes, and new technologies emerging from the technical revolution movement can be quickly promoted and applied in production, promoting the continuous improvement of production levels and driving the technical revolution movement forward wave after wave.

All industries are adopting various forms such as exchange meetings, consultation meetings, promotion meetings, and performance competitions to consolidate, promote, and improve various technical innovations. In order to vigorously promote various new technologies, the Mechanical Industry Bureau launched a massive "Technological Revolution Advanced Experience Promotion Week" in mid-April, holding a series of on-site meetings in several machinery factories, shipyards, and bearing factories with experience in promoting and adopting new technologies and new processes. The Light Industry, Chemical Industry, and Textile Industry Bureaus, and related leading departments, comprehensively promoted dozens of packaging machines researched and developed by various industries since the beginning of the year at a joint city-wide packaging mechanization experience evaluation and exchange conference.

After all industries focused on the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of technological innovations, many innovations that were not perfect were quickly perfected, and those that were not widely adopted were quickly and comprehensively promoted. The innovation projects that have already been promoted and adopted have been further improved through evaluation and exchange. For example, the semi-automatic doffing machine is a major innovation in cotton spinning mills, which can greatly reduce the labor intensity of workers; however, before April, only a few factories were experimenting with it on a few machines, and it was not widely promoted. In early April, a great upsurge of promotion swept through textile factories throughout the city. In just a few days, the application range expanded to 2.5 million spindles, and dozens of doffing workers were freed from the intense and heavy manual operations. The new process of chipless processing, which can greatly shorten processing time and save a lot of metal materials in the electromechanical industry, has now been comprehensively promoted in dozens of factories.

The consolidation and promotion of a large number of new technologies have greatly increased the utilization rate of innovation projects. Some factories currently have more than 70% of the innovation projects that have been put into production and are operating normally, and as high as 90% at the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory.

The great consolidation and great promotion of many advanced technologies immediately played a powerful role in promoting current production. The Party branch of the Shanghai No. 1 Shoe Factory mobilized cadres and the masses in each workshop to conduct specific analysis and research on each new machine, and adopted the method of learning, using, and modifying at the same time, so that many new machines were gradually completed and improved. All innovation projects were put into production, and the output of leather shoes increased by more than 70% compared with before the rectification and consolidation, while saving one-seventh of the labor force.

After many technological innovation projects were widely used in production, they were not only further consolidated, but also promoted the continuous improvement of technological innovation. The Zhabei Strip Steel Plant has recently launched three technological revolutions in a row. The first time, the entire factory's employees spent more than ten days realizing the semi-automation of the rolling mill, changing the original backwardness of manual operation. Subsequently, the factory immediately grasped the consolidation of new technologies, and on this basis mobilized the masses to carry out the second revolution, completing projects such as automatic steel cutting and automatic steel feeding in eight days, and connected the production into an automatic line. The content of the third revolution is even richer, with a series of new technologies such as electronic automatic controllers and radio control consoles appearing. Each of the three revolutions was an improvement over the last. So far, the factory has saved 40% of its labor force, and its production capacity has tripled compared with last year. After the Shanghai Bicycle Factory successfully designed the first domestic automatic combined electroplating machine, many scientific instrument factories, medical equipment factories, and cultural and educational supplies factories have researched and developed several other electroplating machines with different structures based on the principle of this electroplating machine, which can be used not only for chrome plating and nickel plating, but also for electroplating various alloys. The Shanghai Bicycle Factory has also recently designed a new type of roller electroplating machine, which can be used to electroplate any irregular workpieces that could not be electroplated by the past hanging electroplating machines.

    上海把革新成果广泛用于生产
    各行各业采取多种多样的形式，巩固、推广和提高各项先进经验
    使原来不够完善的项目很快完善，没有普遍推广的很快全面推广
    据新华社上海电　上海工业战线各部门正在大抓特抓技术革新成果的巩固、推广和提高的工作。许多工厂采取革新一批、巩固一批、推广一批、提高一批，再革新、再巩固、再推广、再提高的办法，使技术革命运动中涌现出来的大批新设备、新工艺、新技术，在生产中迅速推广采用，促进生产水平不断提高，使技术革命运动一浪高一浪地向前发展。
    各行各业采取交流会、会诊会、推广会、表演赛等多种多样的形式，来巩固、推广和提高各项技术革新。机械工业局为了大力推广各种新技术，4月中旬开展了一个声势浩大的“技术革命先进经验推广周”，先后在几家推广采用新技术、新工艺有经验的机械厂、造船厂、轴承厂，举行了一连串的现场会议。轻工业、化学工业、纺织工业局和有关领导部门，在联合召开的全市包装机械化经验评比交流大会上，全面推广了今年以来各行业研究成功的几十种包装机器。
    各行各业大抓技术革新的巩固、推广、提高以后，许多原来不够完善的革新都很快完善，原来采用不广的都迅速全面推广，已经推广采用的革新项目，通过评比交流，又有了新的提高。例如半自动落纱机，是棉纺厂的一项重大革新，可以大大减轻工人劳动强度；但是在4月份以前，只有个别工厂在少数几台机器上作试验，没有推广。4月上旬，全市纺织厂掀起了一个大推广的热潮，在短短几天内，应用范围就扩大到二百五十万纱锭，几十个落纱工人从紧张繁重的手工操作中解放了出来。机电工业中可以大大缩短加工时间，节约大量金属材料的新工艺——无切屑加工，目前也已在几十家工厂全面推广。
    大批新技术巩固和推广的结果，使革新项目的使用率大大提高。有些工厂目前已经投入生产、正常使用的革新项目，占到了革新总数的70％以上，高的如上海电机厂达到90％以上。
    许多先进技术的大巩固和大推广，立刻对当前的生产起了有力的促进作用。上海第一制鞋厂党总支发动各车间干部和群众，对每一种新机器进行具体分析研究，采取边学、边用、边改的办法，使许多新机器逐步完整和提高，所有革新项目全部投入生产，皮鞋产量比整顿巩固以前提高了70％多，同时节省了七分之一的劳动力。
    许多技术革新项目在生产中广为运用以后，不但更加巩固，而且推动了技术革新不断提高。闸北带钢厂最近接连掀起了三次技术大革命。第一次，全厂职工以十几天的时间，实现了轧钢机半自动化，改变了原来手工操作的落后面貌。接着，厂里就抓紧新技术的巩固工作，并且在这个基础上发动群众进行第二次革命，以八天的时间就完成了自动剪钢、自动送钢等项目，又把生产连成了自动线。第三次革命内容更加丰富，出现了电子自动控制器、无线电操纵台等一系列新技术。三次革命，一次比一次提高。到目前为止，这个厂已经节约了40％的劳动力，生产能力比去年提高了三倍。上海自行车厂设计成功国内第一台自动联合电镀机以后，许多科学仪器厂、医疗器械厂、文教用品厂根据这台电镀机的原理，又研究成功好几种不同结构的电镀机，不仅可以用来镀铬、镀镍，还可以电镀各种合金。上海自行车厂最近也设计成功又一种新型的滚式电镀机，凡是过去吊式电镀机所不能电镀的、形状不规则的工作物，都可以用这台机器电镀。
