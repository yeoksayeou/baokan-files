Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: Japanese leaders from all circles unanimously welcomed the joint declaration issued on the 2nd by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea.

    Sohyo Chairman Kaoru Ota said that the joint declaration is a valuable document for strengthening the unity and joint action of Japanese workers with workers from China and North Korea. Sohyo will make every effort to carry out activities to deepen the understanding and implementation of the joint declaration among all Japanese workers. Ota expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the trade unions of China and North Korea for their support to the Japanese working class. He stated that Sohyo must currently intensify its struggle to prevent the Diet from approving the new "Security Treaty" and support the struggle of the Miike coal mine workers, so as not to disappoint the expectations of Chinese and North Korean workers towards Japanese workers.

    Suzuki Ichizo, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, emphasized that at a time when the US imperialist aggression system in Asia and Africa is beginning to waver, the trade union organizations of China, Japan, and North Korea have formulated a joint action program, which will surely play a huge role in the further development of the struggle of the Asian and African people for independence, peace, and democracy.

    Suzuki stated that the Japanese Communist Party will devote all its efforts to realizing this joint declaration, which inspires the struggle of Japanese workers.

    Akira Kazami, Representative Member of the Japan Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, also pointed out that the trade unions of China, Japan, and North Korea have taken the lead in formulating a joint action program, which is of great significance.

    日本公众领袖发表谈话
    一致欢迎中日朝三国工会联合声明
    指出共同行动纲领将大大促进亚非人民的斗争
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本各界领袖一致欢迎中华全国总工会、日本工会总评议会、朝鲜职业总同盟在2日发表的联合声明。
    日本工会总评议会（总评）议长太田熏说，联合声明是加强日本工人同中朝两国工人的团结和联合行动的宝贵文件，“总评”将全力展开活动，为使日本全体工人加深理解和实行联合声明而努力。太田对中国和朝鲜的工会给与日本工人阶级的支援表示衷心感谢。他表示，当前“总评”要加强展开斗争，阻止国会批准新“安全条约”和支援三池煤矿工人的斗争，这样才不辜负中朝两国工人对日本工人的期望。
    日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员铃木市藏强调指出，在目前美帝国主义在亚非的侵略体制开始动摇的时候，中日朝三国的工会组织制订了共同行动纲领，这必将对亚非各国人民争取独立、和平、民主的斗争的进一步发展起巨大作用。
    铃木表示，日共今后将全力为实现鼓舞日本工人斗争的这项联合声明而奋斗。
    日本亚非团结委员会代表委员风见章也指出，中日朝三国工会这次率先制定了共同行动纲领，具有重大意义。
