    Reported by our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency, the Japanese people's struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous clique's forcible and illegal "passage" of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty is continuing to develop. In Tokyo, representatives from all over the country continued to demonstrate in front of Kishi Nobusuke's residence on the 22nd. They shouted slogans such as "Kishi Nobusuke, step down immediately!"
    "Dissolve the Diet!" "The Japanese people are not bound by the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty!" and other slogans. More than one hundred Diet members of the Socialist Party held a demonstration parade on the busiest streets of Tokyo on the afternoon of the 22nd.
    On the 21st, a portion of the 5,000 people who demonstrated in front of Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's official residence, after returning to the central area of Tokyo, gathered again in Hibiya Park and passed a resolution opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan, as well as a declaration calling on the Japanese people to force the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet to resign and dissolve the Diet. The declaration also stated that it would collect 20 million signatures against the Japan-U.S. military treaty. According to incomplete statistics from the Socialist Party, the number of petitions submitted to the Diet by representatives from various places on the 21st alone exceeded one million.
    In other regions, the struggle against the atrocities of the Kishi Nobusuke group is also surging forward. In Hokkaido, 350,000 workers held strikes and rallies on the 20th. Large-scale mass protest rallies were also held in Sendai, Shizuoka, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, and other places. (Detailed report on page 4)

  “解散国会！”“日本人民不受日美安全条约的拘束！”等口号。社会党的一百多名国会议员22日下午在东京几条最热闹的街道上举行示威游行。
    21日在岸信介首相官邸前举行示威的部分群众五千人，在回到东京市中心地区以后再次在日比谷公园集会，通过了反对艾森豪威尔访问日本的决议以及号召日本人民迫使岸信介内阁辞职和解散国会的宣言。宣言还说，将征集两千万人反对日美军事条约的签名。据社会党不完全统计，21日一天内各地代表向国会递交的请愿书就超过了一百万份。
