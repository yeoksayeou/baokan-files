President Opens the Flap

Lao She

You say Eisenhower I'm a failure?
Oh my, don't underestimate me!
I originally didn't want to go to Paris,
Didn't want to attend the summit conference.
What Paris, what not Paris,
Someone mentions a meeting and I get angry!
It's obvious: once peace is everywhere,
We won't have any business selling arms!
Don't think I also talk about peace,
Hahaha, my peace is military bases!
My ability is strong, although my face is green,
Before even setting off, I had already planned
  the scheme to sabotage the conference!
Didn't you hear the pessimistic news
  I spread?
If you really didn't hear,
Your ears are bad, you should blame yourselves!
What are you saying? What are you saying?
Saying I'm on trial in Paris?
Don't talk nonsense, my dears!
On trial? On trial? I, Eisenhower, can remain calm!
Saying the people of the world laugh at me and scold me,
All saying I'm unreasonable?
Hahaha, I, Eisenhower, am not discouraged,
When it comes to playing the rogue, I always score first!
The Soviet Union mentioned that black airplane,
After investigating and investigating, wasn't it all in vain?
Want me to confess, fine, only this one sentence:
God bless my number one imperiali
  sm!
I am proud, I am satisfied,
Who dares to compete with me in thick-skinnedness?
Please congratulate me on my victory,
Sabotaging the conference, I truly achieved my old goal!
Eisenhower is successful! Eisenhower really has bad ideas!
Huh? Why don't you cheer "Eisenhower's Great Vic
  tory"?
If you don't shout, I will cheer myself,
The whole world curses me, I can still curse myself?
Sabotaged the conference, sabotaged the conference, hee
  hee hee!
Please applaud, don't throw rotten eggs and water
  melon rinds!

    总统开嗙
    老舍你们说艾克我没出息？哎哟哟，不要把咱估计低！我本不愿上巴黎，不愿参加首脑会议。什么巴黎不巴黎，有人一提会议我就生气！明摆着：一旦到处都和平，我们贩卖军火没了生意！别看我也说和平，哈哈哈，我的和平是军事基地！我的本领强，虽然脸发绿，未曾动身，早就打好破坏会议
  的老主意！难道你们没听见，我散布的那些悲观消息？你们要是真没听见啊，耳朵不灵，你们应当怪自己！说什么？说什么？说我受审在巴黎？不要乱说，我的亲爱的！受审？受审？我艾克沉得住气！说什么全世界人民笑骂我，全都说我不讲理？哈哈哈，我艾克没有泄气，讲耍流氓我总考第一！苏联提起那架黑飞机，审来审去，还不是白费力？要我招认，好，只有这一句：上帝保佑我这天字号的帝国主
  义！我自豪，我满意，谁敢跟我比赛厚脸皮？请你们祝贺我的胜利，破坏会议，果然达到了老目
  的！艾克成功！艾克真有坏主意！嗯？你们怎不欢呼“艾克大胜
  利”？你们不喊，我自己会欢呼，全世唾骂，我还能自己骂自己？破坏了会议，破坏了会议，嘻
  嘻嘻！请你们鼓掌，别扔臭鸡蛋与西
  瓜皮！
