Xinhua News Agency, May 18th, TASS Paris dispatch: Soviet Premier Khrushchev gave a press conference in Paris this afternoon for reporters who came to Paris to cover the Four-Power Summit.

At 4:55 PM Moscow time, when cars bearing the Soviet flag approached the News Center building, the Soviet head of government was warmly welcomed by the citizens of Paris.

Before the press conference began, many reporters from newspapers, news agencies, radio stations, television stations, and newsreel companies gathered in the spacious hall of the News Center.

The press conference was opened by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, and Khrushchev delivered a statement at the press conference. After reading the statement, the Soviet head of government answered many questions raised by reporters. The press conference lasted nearly two and a half hours.

Xinhua News Agency, May 18th, TASS Paris dispatch: Soviet Premier Khrushchev issued a statement at a press conference in Paris on the 18th. The full text is as follows: Esteemed ladies and gentlemen!

You are evidently already aware of the statement I made on May 16 to French President de Gaulle, British Prime Minister Macmillan, and American President Eisenhower.

The circumstances that the Soviet government considered it necessary to issue this statement are well known to everyone – I am referring to the aggressive flight made by an American military aircraft over Soviet territory on the eve of the highest-level meeting, and the American government’s public statement that such flights are its national policy.

Now some people are attempting to accuse us, saying that the Soviet Union refused to participate in the conference and presented some kind of ultimatum to the United States. However, we have stated in the past and state now that as long as the American government publicly atones for the insult it inflicted on our country with its aggressive actions, we are willing to participate in the conference. But we cannot believe to this day that the espionage flights conducted by the United States will not be repeated. Please recall how the American leaders behaved after they were caught red-handed.

I will cite some documents, and only documents.

On May 5, when the whole world knew about the news that an American military aircraft had been shot down over Soviet airspace, the State Department said that it was an aircraft flying over Turkey to collect meteorological information. It also insisted that according to the pilot's report, his oxygen equipment had malfunctioned. It was said that the pilot therefore began to lose consciousness, and that in this situation, the aircraft continued to fly a long distance on automatic pilot, possibly accidentally intruding into Soviet airspace. It was reported that the aircraft was being searched for in the mountainous Lake Van area of Turkey.

When we announced that the American aircraft had been shot down in the Sverdlovsk region and the arrested pilot had confessed to conducting espionage activities, U.S. Secretary of State Herter said on May 9 that it was indeed a spy plane. He also said that these flights were conducted according to the president's instructions and according to a plan that included "extensive aerial observation," including the use of "penetration" of Soviet airspace.

On May 11, President Eisenhower himself confirmed Herter's statement.

On May12, the American embassy in Moscow once again stated in its note to the Soviet government that conducting aggressive espionage flights was the established policy of the United States.

Now, the American President has issued a statement in Paris saying that the United States has "stopped its flights" and will not resume them. Some people quote this sentence and ask, what else does the Soviet Union need? They say that the threat of American military aircraft flying over Soviet airspace has been eliminated. This statement may satisfy the lackeys of imperialism.

Imperialists are used to acting like Russian merchants of old: they put mustard on the lips of their lackeys, and those lackeys say "thank you" and bow deeply.

We cannot tolerate insults. We have pride, we have our own dignity, and we represent a powerful socialist country.

But at the preparatory meeting on May 16, Eisenhower said that his words about the American military aircraft stopping their flights meant that the period during which these flights would not be resumed was limited to his term as president. Eisenhower said, I certainly don't know what decisions the next president will make.

It can be seen that what the American president promised was not to abandon the policy of aggression, but only to temporarily "suspend" the flights until January 1961. The period that Mr. President promised to stop the provocative policy of espionage flights is not very long. However, international relations cannot be based on the tenure of one or another leader, otherwise what would be the value of any international agreement?

If we follow the American President's logic, then it would be impossible to hold negotiations on, for example, disarmament. Suppose an agreement is signed today, but tomorrow it will lose its effect and be thrown into the wastepaper basket because the person who signed the agreement has left office.

According to President Eisenhower's statement, the conclusion is that the question of whether American military aircraft will fly over Soviet airspace can only be decided by him. Look, how conceited! Now he says that these planes will no longer fly. How generous.

Of course, whether to send airplanes or not is something that President Eisenhower can decide. But whether airplanes can fly in our airspace is another matter entirely. This is for us to decide, and we will decide it very definitively – we will shoot down such airplanes and deliver a devastating blow to the bases from which the airplanes take off, and to those who establish and actually use these bases. It can be seen that the question is by no means some kind of "favor" that President Eisenhower is bestowing on the Soviet Union. What we demand from the American government is not "favors," but a sincere condemnation of the piratical flights of American reconnaissance planes.

However, President Eisenhower has not said a word of condemnation of the policy of provoking the Soviet Union, the policy under which the spy flights were conducted.

Can this kind of statement by the president satisfy anyone other than the aggressor himself?

Eisenhower declared that he had stopped the aggressive flights that were carried out during his time in the White House. This is not an admission, not even a semi-admission, but clearly an evasion of admission, and thus also an evasion of his responsibility for the aggressive actions. However, a politician's evasion, or even semi-admission, will not enable him to escape his responsibility to history. Even children are told: if you do something naughty, you must admit it and say "I won't do it again." In state affairs, it is especially important to thoroughly admit and draw all the necessary conclusions.

If we were satisfied with the American President's empty words and the "favor" he "bestowed" of stopping flights over the Soviet Union before January 1961, the Soviet people, our country, and the social public opinion of all peace-loving countries would not understand us.

Eisenhower's near-threatening statement about his intention to submit his new "Open Skies" plan to the United Nations cannot but surprise us. After the Pentagon became convinced that the road to Soviet airspace had been closed to American spy planes, it was apparently decided there to send planes to fly for the same purpose, but under the banner of the United Nations. It is to be expected that the United Nations – which is not an American state, not a department of the Pentagon – will refuse to play this undignified role.

Some of you have reported that the flights of American aerial bandits over the Soviet Union are just a "small matter." You are here representing the press of various countries, so I would like to ask you: how would you treat your own government if it treated with indifference and nonchalance the military aircraft of those countries that you often write about as potential military enemies flying over your cities? Would you respect such a government? Would your families and yourselves be calm when you hear other countries' planes roaring overhead?

You must know that the Soviet people also have the same right to think this way, especially since the peoples of our country have vivid memories of the two bloody wars that were imposed on us from the outside, which took the lives of tens of millions of people!

It is noteworthy that the governments of the countries that provided their territory to prepare for and conduct aggressive espionage flights into Soviet airspace are now having to, to some extent or other, explain themselves to public opinion and distance themselves from the actions of American militarists. They seem to have begun to understand – and we believe that in the near future, all those who provide their land as American military bases will understand – that it is not good to joke about these things.

The Soviet government regrets that it is not possible to hold the meeting now. However, as I have said, the Soviet government cannot take a different position. We have done everything we can to prepare well for the Four-Power Summit, however, certain hotheads in the United States sabotaged the meeting before it could even begin.

I repeat, gentlemen, the Soviet Union firmly advocates peaceful coexistence, advocates negotiations, and advocates reaching sensible and mutually acceptable agreements. We will work in this direction, and we are convinced that our peace-loving policy will be met with sympathy and understanding by the people of all countries, and we hope that the leaders of Western countries will also work in this direction. In six to eight months, if they are interested and agree to such a meeting, and create the necessary political environment for it, that is, no longer provoke socialist countries, then we will meet with our partners again in a new and more favorable environment to discuss and solve mature international problems. This moment may come even sooner, but it is only possible under the following conditions: everyone understands that no provocative activity can intimidate the Soviet Union, intimidate socialist countries. It is impossible to make us kneel. Only on an equal footing, without threats and blackmail, can you talk and negotiate with us, and it must be so.

I want to express my gratitude to French President General de Gaulle for making it possible for the heads of government of the great powers to gather in Paris, and for his efforts to hold the highest-level meeting, so that our meeting could be held as planned and meet the goals we came here to achieve.

Today I have bidden farewell to the French President. I exchanged views with him, and I am glad that we share the common desire to continue to strive to develop and strengthen our relations in all aspects in the future. I welcome this and am satisfied that I share a common understanding with the President on this extremely important issue.

I also want to express my gratitude to British Prime Minister Macmillan for his enthusiastic efforts to make the highest-level meeting possible.

Indeed, at the same time, I cannot help but express some regret. If the French President and the British Prime Minister had stood on the position of objectively assessing the facts and had not been influenced by their alliance relations, and if they had shown more will, then perhaps the American leaders would have had to condemn their aggressive actions, thereby creating the conditions for the highest-level meeting to be held and produce the beneficial results that the people of the world expect.

Thank you for your kindness.

Now I am ready to answer your questions, gentlemen.

    赫鲁晓夫在巴黎记者招待会上发表声明
    谴责艾森豪威尔逃避侵略责任
    苏联严正立场不能改变　四国会议已被美国破坏
    新华社18日讯　塔斯社巴黎讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫今天下午在巴黎为到巴黎来采访四国首脑会议消息的记者们举行了记者招待会。
    在莫斯科时间十六点五十五分，当插着苏联国旗的汽车驶近新闻中心大厦时，苏联政府首脑受到巴黎市民热烈的欢迎。
    在记者招待会开始之前，新闻中心宽敞的大厅里就聚集了许多报纸、通讯社、广播电台、电视台和新闻电影的记者。
    记者招待会由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯主持开始，赫鲁晓夫在记者招待会上发表了一个声明。苏联政府首脑在宣读了声明之后，回答了记者们提出的许多问题。记者招待会进行了将近两个半小时。
    新华社18日讯　塔斯社巴黎讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫18日在巴黎举行记者招待会上发表声明，全文如下：尊敬的女士们和先生们！
    你们显然已经知道我在5月16日向法国总统戴高乐、英国首相麦克米伦和美国总统艾森豪威尔所发表的声明。
    苏联政府认为有必要发表这一声明的那种情况，是大家都知道的——我所指的是美国军用飞机在最高级会晤的前夕在苏联上空所作的侵略性的飞行，和美国政府关于这种飞行是它的国家政策的公开声明。
    现在有人企图指责我们，说什么苏联拒绝参加会议，并向美国提出了某种最后通牒。但是，我们过去和现在都声明，只要美国政府公开洗刷它用侵略行动给我国带来的侮辱，我们愿意参加会议。但是，我们直到现在不能相信美国进行的间谍飞行不会重演。请大家回想一下，美国领导人在被当场抓住以后，他们的行径是怎样的。
    我要引用一些文件，而且只引用文件。
    5月5日，当全世界都知道了美国军用飞机在苏联领空被击落的消息后，国务院说，这是一架在土耳其上空飞行、目的在搜集气象情报的飞机。它还硬说，据飞行员报告，他的氧气设备坏了。说什么飞行员因此就开始失去知觉，而在这种情况下，飞机继续靠自动飞行装置飞行了很远的距离，可能偶然地侵入了苏联领空。据报道说，在土耳其山峦重叠的凡湖地区搜寻这架飞机。
    当我们宣布，美国的飞机在斯维德洛夫斯克地区已被击落而被捕的飞行员已承认进行间谍活动的时候，美国国务卿赫脱就在5月9日说，这的确是一架间谍飞机。他并且说，这种飞行是根据总统的指示和根据包括进行“广泛空中观测”在内的计划进行的，这种观测包括采用“渗入”苏联领空的办法。
    5月11日，艾森豪威尔总统本人证实了赫脱的声明。
    5月12日，美国驻莫斯科大使馆在它给苏联政府的照会中再一次声称，进行侵略性间谍飞行是美国的既定政策。
    现在，美国总统在巴黎发表声明说，美国已经“停止了自己的飞行”，并且不会再恢复这种飞行。有人引用这句话问道，苏联究竟还需要什么呢？他们说，美国军用飞机在苏联上空飞行的威胁已经取消了。这种说法可能会使帝国主义的仆从们感到满意。
    帝国主义者习惯于像古时候俄国商人的那种作法：他们用芥末往狗腿子嘴唇上涂，而那些狗腿子说，“谢谢”，并且深深施礼。
    我们不能容忍侮辱，我们有自豪感，有自己的尊严，我们是代表强大的社会主义国家的。
    但是，艾森豪威尔5月16日在预备会议上说，他关于美国军用飞机停止飞行的一些话的意思是，这些飞行不恢复的期限只限于他担任总统的期间。艾森豪威尔说，我当然不知道下一任总统将采取什么样的决定。
    可见美国总统所答应的不是放弃侵略政策，而只是在1961年1月以前暂时“停止”飞行。总统先生答应停止间谍飞行挑衅性政策的时期可不算长啊。然而国际关系不能够建立在这一位或那一位负责人的任期上面，否则任何国际协定会有什么价值呢？
    如果按照美国总统的逻辑，那末，就不可能就——譬如说——裁军问题举行谈判。假定说，今天签订了一项协定，可是明天它就会失去效力，会被扔到字纸篓里去，因为在协定上签字的那个人离职了。
    根据艾森豪威尔总统的声明，就得出这样的结论：美国军用飞机是否将在苏联上空飞行这个问题只能由他来决定。请看，多么的自负啊！现在他说，这些飞机不再飞行了。多么的宽洪大量啊。
    当然，派不派飞机这是艾森豪威尔总统可以决定的事情。但是，飞机能不能在我国领空飞行那就是另外一回事了。这要由我们来决定，我们要十分肯定地决定——我们将击落这种飞机，将给飞机起飞的基地、给那些建立这种基地和实际使用这种基地的人以毁灭性打击。可见，问题决不是艾森豪威尔总统对苏联的某种“恩赐”。我们要求美国政府的不是“恩赐”，而是诚心谴责美国侦察机的强盗飞行。
    然而艾森豪威尔总统没有对向苏联挑衅的政策说过一句谴责的话，而间谍飞行正是根据这一政策进行的。
    总统的这种声明难道能使侵略者本人以外的任何人满意吗？
    艾森豪威尔宣称，他已制止当他在白宫期间进行的侵略飞行。这不是承认，甚至不是半承认，而显然是逃避承认，从而也是逃避他对侵略行动的责任。不过，政治家的逃避、甚至半承认的做法，决不会使他有可能逃脱对历史的责任。甚至对小孩也是这样说的：干了淘气事就要承认，并且要说“以后再不干了”。在国家事务中，彻底承认并且作出一切必要的结论，这尤其重要。
    如果我们满足于美国总统的虚言搪塞和他所“赐与”的在1961年1月之前停止在苏联上空飞行的“恩惠”的话，苏联人民、我国和所有爱好和平国家的社会舆论将不会了解我们。
    艾森豪威尔关于他打算向联合国提出他的“开放天空”的新计划的近似威胁的声明，不能不使我们感到惊奇。在五角大楼深信通往苏联领空的道路已对美国间谍飞机关闭之后，那里显然决定派飞机作同样目的的飞行，不过是在联合国的旗帜下进行。可以预料，联合国——它不是美国的一个州，不是五角大楼的一个分部——将会拒绝起这种有损尊严的作用。
    你们之中某些人的报道说，美国空中强盗在苏联上空的飞行只是一件“小事情”。你们在这里代表各国的新闻界，因此我想问你们：你们将如何对待自己的政府，如果它漠不关心地、满不在乎地对待你们常常作为潜在的军事敌人来写的那些国家的军用飞机飞在你们城市的上空呢？你们是否会尊敬这样的政府？当你们听到别国的飞机在你们头上??响时，难道你们的家庭和你们自己会平心静气吗？
    要知道，苏联人民也同样有权这样考虑，何况我国各族人民对从外部强加于我们的两次流血战争记忆犹新，这两次战争夺去了几千万人的生命！
    值得注意的是，提供自己的领土用来准备和向苏联领空进行侵略性间谍飞行的国家的政府，现在不得不在这种或那种程度上向舆论表白，并同美国黩武主义者的行为划清界限。它们看来已开始理解到——我们相信，在不久的将来，所有提供自己的土地作为美国军事基地的人都会理解到——在这些事情上是不好开玩笑的。
    苏联政府感到遗憾的是，现在没有能够进行会议。但是，我已经说过，苏联政府不能采取另外的立场。我们已经尽了一切力量来很好地准备四国政府首脑会议，然而，美国某些头脑发热的人在会议能够开始以前就破坏了会议。
    我再说一遍，先生们，苏联坚决主张和平共处，主张谈判，主张达成明智的、互相可以接受的协议。我们将在这个方向努力，我们深信我们爱好和平的政策会得到各国人民的同情和谅解，我们但愿西方国家的领导人也将朝这个方向努力。再过六至八个月，如果他们感到兴趣和同意这种会晤，为这种会晤创造必要的政治环境，也就是不再对社会主义国家进行挑衅，那末，我们将在新的更加有利的环境中同我们的伙伴重新会晤，以便讨论和解决成熟了的国际问题。这个时刻也可能到的更快一些，但是，只有在这样的情况之下才有可能：所有的人都理解到，任何人采取任何挑衅活动都不能吓倒苏联，吓倒社会主义国家。要我们屈膝是不可能的。只有在平等的基础上，不进行威胁和讹诈，才可以同我们讲话和谈判，而且必须要这样。
    我要对法国总统戴高乐将军表示感谢，感谢他让大国政府首脑有可能在巴黎聚会，感谢他为了举行最高级会议，为了使我们的会议能像预定的那样举行并符合我们到这里来所要达到的目标而做的努力。
    今天我已经向法国总统辞行。我同他交换了意见，我对我们共同愿意在今后也尽力发展和加强我们在各方面的关系这一点感到高兴。我对这一点表示欢迎，并且对我同总统在这个极重要的问题上有共同的谅解表示满意。
    我也要向英国首相麦克米伦先生表示感谢，感谢他为使最高级会议能够举行而作的热心的努力。
    不错，在这同时，我也不能不表示某些遗憾。如果法国总统和英国首相站在客观估计事实的立场上而不受自己的同盟关系的影响，如果他们更多地表现出意志，那末可能美国的领导人就不得不谴责自己的侵略行动，从而创造条件使最高级会议能够举行并产生全世界人民所期望的有益成果。
    谢谢大家的盛意。
    现在我准备回答大家的问题，先生们。
