Xinhua News Agency, May 13th, Tokyo Dispatch: Three thousand citizens of Tokyo petitioned the Diet today, demanding the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the passage of a vote of no confidence in the Nobusuke Kishi government, and the dissolution of the Diet.

In addition to the petitioners from Tokyo, representatives from Fukuoka, Aichi, and Kyoto also visited the Diet and submitted petitions against the new "Security Treaty."

Toshio Kurihara, a Socialist Party Diet member responsible for receiving petitions, told reporters today that there were 50,000 petitions against the new "Security Treaty" yesterday alone.

Communist Party Diet member Yoshio Shiga and Socialist Party member Kanju Kato addressed the petitioners at a rally held before the Tokyo petitioners visited the Diet, saying, "Six hundred merchants in Gunma Prefecture closed their shops yesterday to express their opposition to the new treaty. Such collective participation by merchants in a progressive movement is unprecedented in Japan. This is one example proving the immense anger felt by the people against the aggressive military treaty."

Shiga said that a mothers' and children's convention held in Yamato City demanded the immediate withdrawal of U-2 "Black Jet" planes currently using the Atsugi Air Force Base near the city. Shiga pointed out that all reactionaries are doomed to fail if they arouse the anger of the people, including children and unorganized mothers.

Shiga called on Japanese workers to hold large-scale political strikes to oppose the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

Socialist Party member Kanju Kato emphasized in his speech at the rally that the united struggle of forces inside and outside the Diet is a decisive factor in the struggle against the new "Security Treaty."

At the same time, about 1,500 students held a sit-in demonstration in front of the Diet. They shouted: "We oppose the Diet's ratification of the Security Treaty!" and "Kishi Nobusuke government, resign!"

In the evening, students held demonstrations in the streets of Tokyo.

In addition to these students, about 1,000 night school students held a rally in the evening and, after the meeting, joined the students who had visited the Diet earlier for a demonstration.

As the situation surrounding the new "Security Treaty" becomes increasingly tense, fascist groups are stepping up their sabotage activities at the instigation of the Kishi Nobusuke government. Today, Bin Akao, the head of the Greater Japan Patriotic Party, drove a truck into the students' demonstration and shouted at the police: "Shoot the students!" After this, the broadcast truck demonstrated around the students, broadcasting the militaristic "Warship March."

In addition, the people of Osaka Prefecture held a rally in Osaka City today against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." The conference also passed a resolution to support the struggle of the Miike coal miners. After the meeting, the participants held a demonstration in the city.

Students in Kyoto City held a demonstration in the city this evening against the new "Security Treaty." The police unreasonably arrested four demonstrators. Subsequently, more than 600 students held a sit-in demonstration in front of the police station, demanding the release of the arrested students.

    反对批准日美军事同盟条约的怒火越烧越旺
    日本各地各界人民继续示威请愿
    志贺义雄号召工人举行大规模政治性罢工
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：东京今天又有三千名市民向国会请愿，要求废除新日美“安全条约”，通过不信任岸信介政府的决议和解散国会。
    除了东京的请愿者以外，来自福冈、爱知和京都的代表们也访问了国会，提交反对新“安全条约”的请愿书。
    负责接受请愿书的社会党国会议员栗原俊夫今天对记者说，反对新“安全条约”的请愿书在昨天一天就有五万件。
    共产党国会议员志贺义雄和社会党议员加藤勘十在东京的请愿者访问国会以前举行的一个大会上向请愿者发表讲话说，“群马县的六百名商人昨天关起他们的店铺，表示反对新条约。商人这样集体参加进步运动，在日本是史无前例的。这是证明人民对侵略性的军事条约所感到的巨大愤怒的事例之一。”
    志贺说，在大和市举行的母亲和儿童大会，要求现在正在使用这个市附近的厚木空军基地的U—2型“黑色喷气机”立即撤出。志贺指出，所有的反动派注定是要失败的，如果他们引起了包括儿童和无组织的母亲在内的人民的愤怒的话。
    志贺号召日本工人们举行大规模的政治性罢工，反对批准新“安全条约”。
    社会党议员加藤勘十在大会上发表讲话时强调说，国会内外的力量的联合斗争，是反对新“安全条约”斗争中的决定性因素。
    与此同时，大约有一千五百名学生在国会前面举行静坐示威。他们高呼：“我们反对国会批准安全条约”和“岸信介政府，辞职！”
    晚上，学生们在东京大街上举行了示威游行。
    除了这些学生外，大约有一千名夜校学生在晚上举行大会，并在会后，同早些时候访问过国会的学生们会合起来举行了示威游行。
    在环绕新“安全条约”问题的形势日益紧张的时候，法西斯团体正在岸信介政府的唆使下加紧进行破坏活动。今天大日本爱国党的头子赤尾敏，驾着一辆卡车开到学生的示威队伍中去，还向警察高喊：
  “开枪打学生呀！”在这以后，这辆广播卡车在学生周围示威，放送军国主义的“军舰进行曲”。
    另外，大阪府人民今天在大阪市举行了反对批准新“安全条约”大会。大会并且通过决议支援三池煤矿工人的斗争。会后，与会者在市内举行了示威游行。
    京都市的学生今天傍晚在市内举行了反对新“安全条约”的示威游行。警察无理逮捕四名示威者。随后有六百多名学生在警察署前面举行静坐示威，要求释放被捕的学生。
