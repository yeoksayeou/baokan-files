Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 26th: According to a May 20th report from "Lao Patriotic News," a company of the Royal Lao Army revolted on April 25th and defected to the Lao people's side.

    This company of the Royal Army, stationed at the Dang Kalu stronghold in Phongsaly Province, revolted because it was dissatisfied with the pro-American reactionaries' "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" adoption of vile and shameless means in the general election. They brought all their American weapons and a large quantity of military supplies.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 26th: According to a May 20th report from "Lao Patriotic News," news of the Lao people's victories against "sweeps" continues to arrive from various places.

    In Khammouane Province, the Lao People's Armed Forces conducted twenty-six counter-"sweep" operations in April, killing or wounding nearly one hundred Royal Army soldiers. In Phongsaly, the People's Armed Forces, in coordination with local masses, launched counter-"sweep" battles in areas such as Muang Hung and Keng Xi, routing the Royal Army and killing or wounding six enemy soldiers.

    On April 20th, the Lao People's Armed Forces also ambushed Royal Army soldiers who had just looted grain from the masses in Sang He (place name), recovering all the grain and wounding fifteen enemy soldiers. In Lower Laos, guerrillas killed seven Royal Army soldiers and wounded one in three consecutive days of counter-"sweep" battles on April 6th, 7th, and 10th.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 26th: According to a May 20th report from "Lao Patriotic News," the Lao people waged a heroic struggle with the American running dog, the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," before and after the general election, opposing the election orchestrated by the committee. According to reports, on April 24th, the day of the vote, hundreds of voters in polling stations eight and nine in Savannakhet Province demonstrated against the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests"' arbitrary and dictatorial actions during the voting.
    
    In Chepone, more than three thousand voters tore up their ballots and refused to vote. A Royal Army captain named Khan Pha in Chepone was dismissed for failing to complete the fraudulent tasks assigned to him by the head of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests." This matter has aroused resentment among some units of the local Royal Army.
    
    On May 4th, more than two thousand five hundred people held a rally in Phongsaly Province and passed a resolution refusing to recognize the election and demanding a new election. In early May, thousands of leaflets demanding a new election appeared in Vientiane and many other cities, many of which were distributed in the name of student, business, and soldier organizations.

    老挝王国军队一个连起义
    携带全副美国装备和大量军用物资投入人民队伍
    老挝人民武装英勇反“扫荡”，胜利消息频传
    新华社河内26日电　据“老挝爱国新闻”5月20日报道，老挝王国军队一个连4月25日起义投奔到老挝人民队伍方面来。
    驻扎在丰沙里省当加拉据点的这连王国军队是因为不满亲美的反动派“保卫国家利益委员会”在大选中采取卑鄙无耻手段而起义的。他们带来了全副美国武器和大量军用物资。
    新华社河内26日电　据“老挝爱国新闻”5月20日报道，老挝人民反“扫荡”胜利的消息继续从各地传来。
    在甘蒙省，老挝人民武装力量4月间进行了二十六次反“扫荡”，毙伤王国军队近百名。在丰沙里，人民武装力量同当地群众配合，在芒昏、更喜等地展开的反“扫荡”战斗中，把王国军队打得抱头鼠窜，毙伤敌军六名。
    老挝人民武装力量还在4月20日狙击了刚刚在桑热（地名）抢劫了群众的粮食的王国军队，夺回了全部粮食，并击伤敌军十五名。在下寮，游击队在4月6日、7日和10日连续三天的反“扫荡”战斗中打死王国军队七人，打伤一人。
    新华社河内26日电　据“老挝爱国新闻”5月20日报道，老挝人民在大选前后曾同美国走狗“保卫国家利益委员会”展开英勇斗争，反对由这个委员会一手导演的大选。据报道，在4月24日投票的那天，在沙湾拿吉省的第八、九号投票站有成百名选民示威游行，反对“保卫国家利益委员会”在投票时的专横、独断行动。
    在车奔，有三千多选民把选票撕毁，拒绝投票。车奔的一名名叫坎发的王国军队上尉因为没有完成“保卫国家利益委员会”头子交给他的舞弊任务而被革职。这件事已在当地王国军队的一些单位中引起愤懑情绪。
    5月4日，在丰沙里省有两千五百多人举行了集会，并通过决议，不承认这次大选，要求重新举行大选。5月初，在万象市和其他许多城市出现了成千张要求重新进行选举的传单，其中许多传单是以学生、工商业者和士兵组织的名义散发的。
