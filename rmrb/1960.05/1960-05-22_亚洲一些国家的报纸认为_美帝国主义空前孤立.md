Xinhua News Agency, 20th. Asian newspapers strongly condemned the United States for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit and supported the Soviet Union's solemn position.

    The "Burma New Times" editorial on the 20th stated that in the history of human relations since ancient times, no national leader has been as die-hard as the President of the United States. The prestige and status of the United States have declined, and Eisenhower has reached the point of ultimate failure.

    Iraq's "National News" published a commentary on the 19th stating that the responsibility for the failure of the Four-Power Summit "lies with Eisenhower and his government, and not with other people and governments."

    The newspaper said that since Eisenhower refused to admit that the United States was guilty, it showed that continuing the meeting was "a waste of time."

    A recent issue of the Indian "New Age" weekly published an editorial entitled "The American Aggressor – Caught and Exposed," stating that the incident of the United States sending U-2 spy planes into Soviet airspace "symbolizes the shameless aggressive policy of the United States."

    The editorial said: "The chief culprits of the (American) Pentagon and the State Department and their leader, the American President, have repeatedly contradicted themselves, sometimes denying they are responsible, sometimes admitting it, sometimes intimidating, sometimes roaring mad, but all to no avail."

    The editorial condemned the die-hard elements of U.S. imperialism for "supporting" the summit meeting in words, while taking action to sabotage the meeting. It pointed out that the Western camp is in a state of chaos.

    India's "Free Press" editorial on the 18th said, "Khrushchev struck at the most vital part of the warmongers."

    The editorial said that the main enemy of peace was caught red-handed in front of the whole world while acting as a thief. This is no small benefit for peace-loving people.

    亚洲一些国家的报纸认为
    美帝国主义空前孤立
    新华社20日讯　亚洲一些国家的报纸强烈谴责美国破坏四国会议，并支持苏联严正立场。
    “缅甸新时代报”20日的社论说，旷古以来的整个人类关系的历史中，没有一个国家领袖像美国总统那么死硬。美国的威信和地位已经下降，艾森豪威尔已到最后失败的地步了。
    伊拉克“国家报”19日发表评论说，四国首脑会议“告吹的责任在于艾森豪威尔和他的政府，而不在于其他的人和政府”。
    这家报纸说，艾森豪威尔既然拒绝承认美国有罪，这说明继续举行会议是“徒然浪费时间”。
    最近一期的印度“新世纪”周报发表的一篇题为“美国侵略者——被抓住和暴露了”的社论说，美国派遣U—2型间谍飞机侵入苏联上空的事件“象征着美国的厚颜无耻的侵略政策”。
    社论说：“（美国）五角大楼和国务院的首恶分子和他们的头子美国总统都曾经出尔反尔，一会儿否认他们要负责，一会儿又承认，一会儿进行恫吓，一会儿又咆哮发狂，这一切都没有用。”
    社论谴责美帝国主义死硬派在口头上“拥护”首脑会议的同时，却采取行动来破坏这个会议。它指出，西方阵营正处于混乱的局面。
    印度“自由报”18日的社论说，“赫鲁晓夫打击了战争贩子最要害的地方。”
    社论说，和平的主要敌人在当小偷的时候在全世界面前被抓住了。这对爱好和平的人民是一个不小的好处。
