Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd: The broad masses of workers on the industrial front in the capital continue to leap forward on the basis of "April exceeding March," and many factories and mines have achieved a flying start in May production.

On May Day, the Party Committee Secretary and the Factory Director of the Iron Smelting Plant of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company personally followed the production shift to solve problems in a timely manner. The workers of the No. 3 Blast Furnace divided their work according to their specialties, carefully inspected the equipment to ensure smooth furnace conditions, and continued to strictly implement the operating policy of "taking wind as the key link," adopting operating methods of high blast temperature, high blast pressure, high humidity, high load, and large air volume. On the 1st, pig iron production exceeded the plan by 1.5%, and on the 2nd, production increased by another 4.6% compared to the 1st. The steel output of the No. 1 Workshop of the Beijing Steel Plant exceeded the plan by 46.3% on the 1st, with a 100% qualification rate. As soon as the workers of the Jingxi Mining Bureau entered the Red May, their production enthusiasm soared even higher. On the 1st, Party Committee Secretaries, Mine Directors, Engineers, and Section Cadres of various factories and mines went down to the wells and worked with the miners. On the 1st and 2nd, they overfulfilled the raw coal production plan by 4,211 tons.

Many factories and mining enterprises had already made various preparations while achieving "April exceeding March" to carry out a major campaign in Red May and achieve a greater leap forward. The Liulihe Cement Plant, which was rated as a city-wide red flag unit in the first quarter inter-factory competition, convened a factory-wide worker conference at the end of April. The Party Committee pointed out at the meeting that Red May is a key month to achieve a second quarter surpassing the first. After the meeting, they mobilized workers to focus on key tasks and carry out technological innovation and technological revolution according to the new situation to ensure a full house in May. On the 1st and 2nd, cement production exceeded the plan by 32%, completing the plan, and increasing by 24% compared with the same period in April. The product quality fully met the national standards, marking a good start for a full house in May.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 3rd: On the basis of overfulfilling the April plan, the workers of many factories in Shanghai have boosted their enthusiasm and put forward the slogan "May is Redder than April," striving to complete half of the annual plan in the first half of the year.

Recently, the Party Committees of various districts have instructed all factories to earnestly consolidate, promote, and improve the current production and technological revolution on the one hand, and to prepare for the next stage of production on the other. In late April, the Party Committees of various districts convened meetings of the Party Committee Secretaries of various factories to specifically arrange the May leap forward plan. All factories also promptly mobilized the masses to discuss the May leap forward targets and implement the plans to workshops, teams, and individuals. On the first day of work after May Day, leading cadres of many factories went to the production front lines to guide production. After celebrating their festival, the workers poured into the factories early in the morning and enthusiastically threw themselves into the battle of "Red May." In various industries, many factories launched a competition craze of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward on the first day of work. The state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory carried out various new forms of competition such as relay races, tug-of-war, counterpart competitions, and tie-up competitions. New production records continued to appear. Shang Decheng, a worker, increased his daily output of rollers (parts on spinning frames) from 550 on April 30th to 785.

In order to ensure the realization of the leap forward plan, all factories have tried every means to tap the potential of raw materials, actively clear warehouses, vigorously carry out comprehensive utilization of raw materials, and mobilize the masses to continue the technological revolution, vigorously carry out consolidation, promotion, and improvement work, as an important measure for various industries to achieve May surpassing April and complete half of the annual plan in the first half of the year.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 3rd: The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued a fighting call to workers throughout the province to wage a major battle in May and June, striving to complete more than half of the annual plan for the output of major industrial products in the first half of the year. The call specifically requires the development of raw material production in order to drive the overall leap forward of other products.

The current production situation in Guangdong Province is very good. The rapid development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on the "Four Modernizations" has greatly increased the province's industrial production. In the first quarter of this year, the total industrial output value plan was completed by 101.4%, an increase of 49.4% and 9.3% compared with the same period last year and the fourth quarter respectively. The Provincial Party Committee believes that in the face of this excellent situation, our task is to boldly mobilize the masses, make persistent efforts, and win an even greater victory in the second quarter on the basis of the good start in the first quarter, striving to complete more than half of the annual plan for the output of major industrial products.

In order to complete this task, the Provincial Party Committee decided to focus on the production of raw materials in May and June, especially the production of coal, iron, and timber. It requires Party committees at all levels to resolutely implement the policy of "taking steel as the key link and coal as the focus" in industrial production, and to launch a mass coal-seizing campaign with the same vigor as developing iron and steel, with the entire Party mobilized and the masses mobilized to ensure the completion of this year's raw coal production task two months ahead of schedule. To this end, the Provincial Party Committee has decided to transfer a group of capable cadres to the front line, to be responsible for specific areas, and to focus on the four major coal mines of Nanling, Quren, Luojiadu, and Lianyang, and requires all regions and departments to support the coal-seizing campaign from all directions, and will not withdraw until complete victory is achieved.

Under the deployment of "guaranteeing steel with coal," the Provincial Party Committee also decided to launch a vigorous mass iron-smelting upsurge throughout the province, with a major battle in May and June, striving to complete more than half of the annual iron production task in the first half of this year. The central link is to improve the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces. At the same time, widely establish "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" and iron-smelting bases. In terms of timber production, the Provincial Party Committee requires that we seize the period from after spring plowing to before summer harvest, take advantage of the spring water rise, fix professional teams, and vigorously carry out timber transportation. At the same time, we must vigorously promote the comprehensive utilization and conservation and substitution of timber.

In order to develop the production of raw materials, materials, and fuels at high speed, the Provincial Party Committee calls on all localities to accelerate the construction of "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" centered on coal, iron, and railways. The Provincial Party Committee requires that all counties and communes with conditions should do a good job in "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" centered on coal, iron, and railways, and at the same time, they can also engage in "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" of cement, chemical industry, electricity, and non-ferrous metals. In the vigorous "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" movement, we must earnestly implement the policy of self-reliance, using indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, starting from small to large, and gradually improving.

The Provincial Party Committee believes that the key to completing these tasks is to continue to vigorously carry out the technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on the "Four Modernizations." The Provincial Party Committee requires that in this movement, in addition to continuing to improve the mechanization level of factories and mining enterprises and improve labor productivity, we must also vigorously engage in diversified operations and develop comprehensive utilization. At present, it is particularly important to resolutely do a good job in the comprehensive utilization of timber, rice bran, peat soil, edible salt, coal gasification, wet-ground slag cement, charcoal ash brick making, sugarcane, and other projects. In order to strengthen the leadership of the movement, the Provincial Party Committee decided to launch a major inspection, major summary, major evaluation, major promotion, and major improvement in the near future to make the "Four Modernizations" movement more powerfully promote the continued leap forward of production.

    北京许多企业夺得五月开门红
    上海工人力争五月超四月　广东省委号召大力增产原材料
    据新华社3日讯　首都工业战线的广大职工在“4月超3月”的基础上继续跃进，许多厂矿企业夺得了5月生产开门红。
    “五一”这一天，石景山钢铁公司炼铁厂党委书记和厂长都亲自跟班生产，及时解决问题。三高炉工人按专业进行分工，对设备进行细致的检查，保证炉况顺利，并继续严格执行以风为纲的操作方针，采取高风温、高风压、高湿度、高负荷和大风量的操作方法，1日生铁产量比计划超额1.5％，2日产量又比1日提高了4.6％。北京钢厂第一车间1日的钢产量超过计划46.3％，合格率达到百分之百。京西矿务局职工一进入红五月，生产热情更加高涨。1日各厂矿党委书记、矿长、工程师和科室干部分别到井下和矿工们一同劳动，1、2两日超额四千二百一十一吨完成了原煤生产计划。
    许多厂矿企业早在实现“4月超3月”的同时，就做了各种准备，要在红五月大干一场，实现更大跃进。在第一季度厂际竞赛中被评为全市红旗单位的琉璃河水泥厂，在4月底召开全厂职工大会，党委在会上指出红五月是实现二季超一季的关键月。会后就发动职工大抓关键，根据新的形势大搞技术革新和技术革命，保证5月满堂红。1、2两日的水泥产量超额32％，完成了计划，比4月同期提高了24％，产品质量完全合乎国家标准，为5月满堂红打响了头一炮。
    据新华社上海3日电　上海市许多工厂的职工在超额完成4月份计划的基础上，鼓起了更大的干劲，提出“5月更比4月红”的口号，力争上半年完成全年计划的一半。
    最近，各区区委都布置各厂要认真作到一手抓当前生产和技术革命的巩固、推广、提高工作；一手抓下一步生产的准备工作。4月下旬，各区区委都召开了各工厂党委书记会议，具体布置5月份跃进计划。各厂也都及时发动群众，讨论了5月份跃进指标，把计划落实到车间、小组和个人。“五一”节后开工的第一天，许多厂的领导干部都上生产前线，指导生产。工人们在欢度了自己的节日以后，一大早都涌进了工厂，更加热情地投入了“红五月”的战斗。各行业中有许多工厂在开工的第一天，就掀起了比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进的竞赛热潮。国营上海第二纺织机械厂开展了接力赛、拔河赛、对口赛、挂钩赛等各种新的竞赛形式，生产新纪录不断出现，工人尚德成生产罗拉（细纱机上的零件）的日产量，从4月30日的五百五十根提高到七百八十五根。
    为了确保跃进计划的实现，各厂都千方百计地挖掘原料材料潜力，积极清理仓库，大搞原料材料的综合利用，并且发动群众继续大闹技术革命，大搞巩固、推广、提高工作，作为各行业实现5月超4月，上半年完成全年计划一半的重要措施。
    新华社广州3日电　中共广东省委最近向全省职工发出了大战5、6月，力争上半年完成工业主要产品产量全年计划一半以上的战斗号召。号召特别要求发展原材料生产，以带动其他产品全面跃进。
    广东省当前生产的形势很好。以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动的迅猛发展，使全省的工业生产有了很大增长。今年第一季度工业总产值计划完成了101.4％，比去年同期和第四季度分别增长49.4％和9.3％，省委认为，在这大好形势的面前，我们的任务，就是要放手发动群众，再接再厉，在第一季度开门红的基础上，再在第二季度打一个更大的胜仗，力争使工业主要产品产量完成全年计划的一半以上。
    为了完成这个任务，省委决定在5、6月间要大抓原料材料生产，特别是煤、铁、木材生产。要求各级党委坚决贯彻工业生产以钢为纲，以煤为重点的方针，以大搞钢铁的劲头，全党动手，发动群众开展一个群众性的夺煤大会战，保证提前两个月完成今年原煤生产任务。为此，省委已经决定抽调一批得力干部上前线，分片包干，大抓南岭、曲仁、罗家渡、连阳四大煤矿，并且要求各个地区各个部门从四面八方支援夺煤大会战，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    在“以煤保钢”的部署下，省委还决定在全省范围内开展一个轰轰烈烈的群众性炼铁热潮，大战5、6月，力争在今年上半年完成全年产铁任务一半以上，中心环节是提高小高炉利用系数。同时，广泛地建立“小洋群”、“小土群”、炼铁基地。在木材生产方面，省委要求抓紧春耕后到夏收前这段时间，利用春水上涨的机会，固定专业队伍，大搞木材运输。与此同时，还要大力推行木材的综合利用和节约代用。
    为了高速度地发展原料、材料、燃料的生产，省委号召各地要加速建设以煤、铁、铁路为中心的“小洋群”、“小土群”。省委要求，凡是有条件的县和公社都要搞好煤炭、炼铁、铁路为中心的“小洋群”、 “小土群”，同时也可以搞水泥、化工、电力、有色金属的“小洋群”和“小土群”。在大搞“小洋群”和“小土群”运动中，要认真贯彻自力更生、土法上马、土洋结合、由小到大，逐步提高的方针。
    省委认为，完成这些任务的关键是继续大搞以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。省委要求各地在这一运动中除了继续提高厂矿企业的机械化程度，提高劳动生产率以外，还要大搞多种经营，发展综合利用。目前特别要坚决搞好木材、米糠、泥炭土、食盐、煤气化、湿碾矿渣水泥、炭灰制砖、甘蔗等项目的综合利用。为了加强对运动的领导，省委决定最近期间要开展大检查、大总结、大评比、大推广、大提高，使“四化”运动更有力地促进生产继续跃进。
