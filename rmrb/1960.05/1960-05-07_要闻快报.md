    Qinghai Vigorously Plants Oil and Sugar Industrial Crops
    Farmers of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province are actively planting various industrial crops, adapting to local conditions. Currently, in the oil crop producing areas of the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture at the foot of the Qilian Mountains, the newly opened sugar beet production bases in the Qaidam Basin and on the Hainan Grassland, and the eastern agricultural areas suitable for planting fiber crops, planting work has entered a high tide.
    In planting industrial crops, people of all ethnic groups are not only expanding the area but also paying attention to improving the quality of planting. Last winter and this spring, all counties universally held technical training classes for industrial crops and organized specialized production teams or production groups to be specifically responsible for management. In Minhe County, where oil crops were never or rarely fertilized in the past, every mu of rapeseed land is fertilized with 5,000 to 7,000 jin of base fertilizer this year.

    Zhejiang Various Places Rush to Plant Jute
    Various communes in Zhejiang Province are striving to complete the jute planting plan ahead of schedule and exceed the plan, while ensuring the planting area of ​​grain. As of April 27, 340,000 mu of jute have been sown throughout the province.
    Hangzhou, Xiaoshan, Haining, Shangyu and other major hemp-producing areas have universally promoted jute seeders, hand-cranked seed mixing machines, trenching seeders, linkage machines, and grooving machines. More than 14,000 seeders have been promoted and used throughout the province, and each machine can sow 15 to 18 mu per day, which is 7 to 9 times more efficient than manual sowing.

    Most of Anhui's Newly Reclaimed Land Planted with Crops
    Since last winter, Anhui Province has reclaimed 7 million mu of wasteland. Most of the newly reclaimed land has been planted with crops such as grain, small oil crops, melons, and vegetables.
    At present, while continuing to reclaim wasteland and make use of gaps to expand the planting area, all localities are also carrying out water conservancy construction, improving soil, and meticulously preparing the land in response to the characteristics of the newly reclaimed wasteland, to ensure that all the reclaimed land is planted with crops.

    Inner Mongolia Plants More Than 7 Million Mu of Forest in Spring
    The spring afforestation movement in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved great results. As of April 26, more than 7.52 million mu of forest had been planted, accounting for 75.2% of this year's plan, an increase of nearly double compared with the same period last year.
    In this spring's afforestation movement, thousand-mu forests, ten-thousand-mu mountains, and hundred-li forest belts have appeared everywhere. Zhelimu League and Ulanqab League alone have 174 concentrated forests of more than 1,000 mu, 78 of more than 5,000 mu, and 39 of more than 10,000 mu. In the process of afforestation, all localities have actively established forest farms and nurseries.

    Ningbo Prefecture Implements "Four Stations and One Team"
    In order to adapt to the new situation after the large-scale promotion and use of new tools, Zhejiang's Ningbo Prefecture has universally established "Four Stations and One Team" in various communes and production teams (establishing pumping stations with the commune as a unit, and establishing sowing tool stations, deep plowing plow stations, rice transplanter stations, and shepherd boy teams with the production team as a unit). This guarantees organizationally that a new type of tool is promoted and used once it's available. "Four Stations and One Team" also facilitates the matching of labor, cattle, and tools for assembly line operations, which greatly improves labor efficiency.

    New Wheat Variety Bred by Grafting Cogongrass and Wheat
    Zhong Qingzhi and other young farmers from the Hongqi People's Commune in Pengxi County, Sichuan, after more than a year of repeated research and experiments, grafted cogongrass and wheat to breed the first generation of high-quality wheat variety "Hongqi No. 1" with strong lodging resistance, large ears, and many grains. This kind of wheat is nearly three feet tall, with thick stems like cogongrass, leaves about 2.4 centimeters wide, deep green in color, and resistant to lodging. It also has extremely strong tillering ability, with 70 to 80 tillers per plant, ears four inches long, and each ear bearing about 25 grains, which is six to seven more than ordinary wheat varieties.

    要闻快报
    青海大种油料、糖料经济作物
    青海省各族农民因地制宜，积极播种各类经济作物。目前，在祁连山下海北藏族自治州的油料产区，在柴达木盆地和海南草原上新开辟的甜菜生产基地，在适于种植纤维植物的东部农业区，播种工作都已经进入高潮。
    各族人民在播种经济作物中，不仅扩大面积，同时注意提高播种质量。去冬今春，各县普遍举办了经济作物技术训练班，组织了经济作物专业生产队或生产组，专责经管。过去种油料作物从不施或很少施肥的民和县，今年每亩油菜地都施了五千斤到七千斤的底肥。
    浙江各地赶种黄麻
    浙江省各地公社在保证粮食种植面积的前提下，千方百计力争提前和超额完成黄麻播种计划。到4月27日止，全省已播下黄麻三十四万亩。
    杭州、肖山、海宁、上虞等主要麻区都普遍推广黄麻播种机、手摇拌种机，开槽播种机、连动机和压槽机等。全省已推广使用的一万四千多部播种机，每部每天可播种十五到十八亩，比手播工效提高七倍到九倍。
    安徽新开荒地大部种上庄稼
    安徽省去冬以来，已开垦荒地七百万亩。新开的荒地，大部已种上粮食、小油料、瓜菜等作物。
    目前，各地在继续开垦荒地，利用隙地，扩大播种面积的同时，又针对新垦荒地的特点，大搞水利建设，改良土壤，精细整地，保证把已开荒地全部种上庄稼。
    内蒙古春季造林七百多万亩
    内蒙古自治区春季造林运动取得巨大成绩。到4月26日已造林七百五十二万多亩，占今年计划的75.2％，比去年同期增加近一倍。
    各地在今春造林运动中，千亩林、万亩山、百里林带到处出现，仅哲盟和乌盟即有千亩以上的成片林一百七十四处，五千亩以上的七十八处，万亩以上的三十九处。各地在造林当中，积极兴办了林场和苗圃。
    宁波专区推行“四站一队”
    浙江宁波专区为适应新工具大量推广使用后的新情况，各地公社、生产队普遍建立“四站一队”（以公社为单位建立抽水机站，以生产队为单位建立播种农具站、深耕犁站、插秧机站和牧童队），这就从组织上保证了新式工具推广一部、使用一部。“四站一队”还便于实行劳力、耕牛、工具配套，进行流水作业，促使劳动工效大大提高。
    用芭茅和小麦嫁接育成新麦种
    四川蓬溪县红旗人民公社青年农民钟庆植等，经过一年多来的反复研究试验，用芭茅和小麦嫁接培育出了抗倒力强、穗大粒多的良种小麦“红旗一号”第一代。这种小麦株高将近三尺，茎秆粗壮有如芭茅，叶片宽约二点四公分，颜色深绿，能抗倒伏，且发蔸力极强，每窝分蘖七、八十根，穗长四寸，每穗约结子二十五台，比一般麦种多六、七台。
