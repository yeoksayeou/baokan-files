Xinhua News Agency, London, May 10th: The "Daily Express" here published an article today by its reporter, Pincher, pointing out that British aircraft also intruded into socialist countries for espionage activities.

    The article stated that due to the limited range of British aircraft, when conducting such espionage reconnaissance activities, they were "always limited to intruding very close to the (socialist countries') borders, so that if the aircraft were attacked, they could almost certainly fly back over the territory of friendly countries."

    The article also said: "The Foreign Office controls this type of flight through a secret agency, which is directly responsible to Foreign Secretary Lloyd."

    Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, May 11th: West Germany's "Frankfurter Rundschau" said today that, according to reliable sources, aircraft engaging in espionage activities by sneaking into the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have also taken off and landed on West German territory. A West German Defense Ministry spokesman denied at a press conference a few days ago that West German airports had ever provided facilities for "any reconnaissance operations against the Eastern bloc" by West Germany's allies. But the "Frankfurter Rundschau" today exposed this lie. The newspaper said that "this kind of thing has happened at Frankfurt/Main Airport in West Germany."

    英国“每日快报”承认
    英国飞机曾侵入社会主义国家
    新华社伦敦10日电　这里的“每日快报”今天刊载了它的记者平彻尔写的一篇文章，指出英国飞机也侵入社会主义国家进行间谍活动。
    这篇文章说，英国由于其飞机航程的限制，在进行这种间谍侦察活动时“一直限于在离（社会主义国家）边界非常近的地方侵入，以便飞机遭到攻击时几乎可以肯定通过友好国家领土的上空飞回”。
    这篇文章还说：“外交部通过秘密机构控制这种飞行，这个机构直接对外交大臣劳埃德负责”。
    据新华社波恩11日电　西德“法兰克福评论报”今天说，据可靠消息，潜入苏联和其他社会主义国家进行间谍活动的飞机也曾经在西德的领土上起飞和着陆。西德国防部发言人前几天在记者招待会上否认过西德的飞机场曾经为西德的盟国“对东方集团的任何侦察行动”提供便利。但是“法兰克福评论报”今天戳穿了这种谎话。这家报纸说，在“西德法兰克福的来因—美因机场上，就曾经发生过这种事”。
