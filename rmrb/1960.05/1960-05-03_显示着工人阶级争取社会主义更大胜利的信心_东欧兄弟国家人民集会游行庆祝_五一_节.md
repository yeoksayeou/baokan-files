Gomułka said that as we celebrate May Day today, we must express our will to defend peace and unite with all peace-loving forces around the world. We demand the conclusion of a comprehensive and complete disarmament agreement, the prohibition of nuclear and hydrogen weapon testing, the cessation of West Germany's militarization, and the cessation of West Germany's revanchist activities aimed at opposing the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and European peace. We demand the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the resolution of the West Berlin issue.

Gomułka concluded by saying that we can look to the future with confidence because we are on the right path and have loyal friends and allies.

The celebration ended with the singing of the Internationale.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 1st: Three hundred thousand residents of East and West Berlin held a grand parade in the democratic district of Berlin today to warmly celebrate International Labor Day.

The parading masses, holding high signs such as "Strive for a peace treaty with the two Germanys," "Turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city," and "Strive for the victory of socialism," marched into Marx-Engels Square. Here, they were reviewed by German Democratic Republic party and government leaders Ulbricht and others.

Also on the reviewing stand was Max Reimann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany. Jambyn Batmönkh, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Great Hural of the Mongolian People's Republic, who is currently visiting, also attended the holiday observation.

Today, red flags fluttered around Marx-Engels Square, and the parading masses were in an exceptionally enthusiastic mood. Workers held models of their products and various signs, demonstrating the will of the working class of the German Democratic Republic to strive with full confidence to realize the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) for the victory of socialism.

Thousands of West Berlin workers, holding signs such as "Strive to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city!" and "Not a penny for Strauss's war chest!" marched across the square with their children, as the spectators gave them warm cheers.

Before the parade, a grand military parade was held.

Herbert Warnke, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, delivered a brief holiday speech. He said that this year's parade powerfully demonstrates the strength of the German Democratic Republic in its struggle for peace and socialism. He pointed out that if the German working class takes unified action and unites with all peace-loving forces, it can stop the activities of West German militarism.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, May 1st: A grand mass parade with more than 200,000 participants was held in Sofia today to warmly celebrate International Labor Day.

Bulgarian party and government leaders Zhivkov, Yugov, and Ganev, among others, reviewed the parade from the rostrum on "September 9th" Square.

The parade began at 10:00 AM and lasted for three hours. The parading masses held high various signs demonstrating their overfulfillment of this year's first-quarter production plan, fully demonstrating the will of the Bulgarian working people to complete the Third Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) ahead of schedule. A huge and eye-catching sign hung on the east wall of the square, reading: "Accelerate Development! Build socialism completely in our motherland!"

The people participating in the parade enthusiastically shouted slogans such as "Long live the Bulgarian Communist Party!" Balloons of various colors, symbolizing peace, slowly rose into the sky.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, May 1st: Today, a mass parade with more than 300,000 participants was held in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, to warmly celebrate International Labor Day. At 9:00 AM sharp, Romanian party and government leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chivu Stoica, and Maurer, among others, ascended the reviewing stand amidst warm applause and cheers from the masses.

On the viewing stand were delegations of working people from the Soviet Union, China, and other countries.

Nicolae Ceaușescu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, spoke before the parade began. He said that the tasks put forward by the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party (1955) are being realized, and the targets for many important products can be completed ahead of schedule. Currently, the Romanian people are launching a vigorous labor competition to greet the Third Congress of the Party and to complete the 1960 economic plan. The task for the first quarter of 1960 has been successfully overfulfilled by 4%.

He said that as we celebrate May Day this year, the forces of peace and socialism are continuing to rise. However, the imperialist aggressive blocs have not stopped their activities; they continue to clamor for a "Cold War" and hinder the realization of peace. The unity of peace forces should be further strengthened and vigilance maintained, which is the way to ensure peace.

After Ceaușescu's speech, the parade began. Workers held huge signs showing the achievements they had made in production and the production guarantees they had put forward to greet the Party Congress.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, May 1st: Tens of thousands of working people in Tirana held a grand parade on Stalin Boulevard today to celebrate International Labor Day.

Tirana, after a long period of rain, was completely bathed in warm sunshine today. Red flags and festive slogans were hung on all the main streets of the city.

At 12:00 noon, Albanian party and government leaders Hoxha, Lleshi, and Shehu, among others, ascended the rostrum, and cheers and applause resounded throughout the venue. Nush, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Albanian Labour Party, spoke before the parade began. He said that the Albanian people have made many achievements in international relations. The Labour Party has made outstanding contributions to strengthening the unity of the international working class, thereby severely striking at the attempts of the Yugoslav revisionists to split the international workers' movement. As a member of the socialist family headed by the great Soviet Union, Albania exposed the plans of the US imperialist warmongers and their partners. The Albanian people fully support the policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and support the continuous efforts of the Soviet Union to ease international tensions, stop nuclear weapon testing, and achieve complete and thorough disarmament.

After Nush's speech, the parade, led by huge statues of Marx and Lenin, marched mightily past the rostrum. At the forefront were Young Pioneers and children. Then came the ranks of workers, students, peasants, and office workers. They carried product models and various charts and signs to report their achievements to the leaders.
