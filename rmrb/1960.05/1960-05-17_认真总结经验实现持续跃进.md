    Earnestly Summarize Experiences to Achieve Continuous Leaps Forward
    Zhao Yuan, First Secretary of the CCP Jingdezhen Municipal Committee
    Jingdezhen, a city known worldwide for its porcelain production, is presenting a scene of vigorous development and prosperity. The storm of technical innovation and technical revolution is rapidly changing the face of this ancient city. The ceramic industry, once ridiculed for not even being able to find a single screw, has now had most of its operations replaced by machinery. On the basis of completing all production tasks ahead of schedule by forty-four days last year with guaranteed quality and quantity, in the first quarter of this year, all industrial production indicators not only maintained the level of the fourth quarter of last year, but also increased by 61% compared with the same period last year, and have been completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled.
    Under the excellent situation where the tide of technical innovation and technical revolution is rising higher and higher, this year Jingdezhen's ceramic industry will undergo another leap forward change. While greatly increasing the production of various high-grade and exquisite daily-use porcelain, it will also comprehensively develop various cutting-edge industrial porcelain, electrical porcelain, building porcelain, and chemical porcelain. Ceramic production operations will be basically mechanized and semi-mechanized. Adapting to the needs of the technological revolution in the ceramic industry, in addition to the further accelerated development of existing industries such as machinery, coal, and building materials, new industries such as motor manufacturing, steel, and basic chemicals will also be established based on a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. In this way, the production landscape can be comprehensively changed, enabling Jingdezhen's porcelain production to develop faster and more fully meet the growing needs of all parties.
    To accomplish such a task in a short period of time, there will certainly be many difficulties, but we are full of confidence in victory. Because after two years of continuous great leaps forward, we have explored and summarized a relatively complete set of experiences in leading mass movements in implementing the general line of socialist construction.
                    Overall Planning, Phased Arrangements
    Inspired by the general line, in 1959, based on the arrangements of the entire province and the specific conditions of our city, we proposed to build Jingdezhen into a complete industrial base with porcelain as the main industry, supported by machinery, metallurgy, electricity, coal, mining, building materials, and the chemical industry, all based on modern technology, within three to five years, as well as a plan for overall and comprehensive development of grain as the main industry, with grain, oil, tea, fruit, wood, livestock, poultry, and aquatic products. We also proposed specific plans by system to ensure the phased realization of this general plan. Such as the ceramic industry technical transformation plan centered on the "four modernizations" of pulverization mechanization, raw material refinement, etc., as well as the corresponding plans for establishing the machinery industry, cultivating technical talents, developing mountainous areas, repairing highways, and establishing raw material and fuel supply bases, etc. In this way, with a general plan and phased plans by unit, the intentions of the leadership and the demands of the masses were combined, which played a great role in mobilizing and organizing the masses. In particular, because there was a plan, there was a center, mobilizing all positive factors from all aspects, twisting them into a rope, forming a strong force that is invincible, thus accelerating the speed of socialist construction. According to our original plan, it would take three years to basically realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of ceramic production, but now it can be completed one year ahead of schedule. In a short period of just over a year, we established a mechanical industry capable of manufacturing all ceramic machinery, trained tens of thousands of workers capable of using mechanical operations and mastering new technologies, established our own coal and raw material supply bases, and built hundreds of kilometers of transportation lines.
                  Grasp the Key, Launch Fierce Attacks
    There are two different approaches to implementing a plan: one is to advance on all fronts without prioritizing what is important or urgent, deploying troops everywhere; the other is to seize the key that has a decisive significance for the overall situation at different times, that is, to seize the weak links, concentrate superior forces, organize fierce attacks, conquer one and then another, finish one batch and then another. These two different approaches produce two different results. The former is a war of attrition, firing a shot here and a shot there, not only failing to hit the vital point, but also affecting the enthusiasm of the masses and putting the leadership in a passive position. The latter is a war of annihilation, which can achieve clarity and rapid progress. Last year, Jingdezhen organized three major campaigns based on the annual general plan. From June to August, in response to the shortage of raw material and fuel supply at the time, a campaign was launched with the central task of vigorously developing the production and transportation of raw materials and fuels, and overcoming the raw material and fuel barrier. From September to November, a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on promoting advanced experience was organized. From November to December, a mass movement centered on large-scale water conservancy construction, large-scale highway repairs, large-scale fertilizer accumulation, and large-scale preparation for raw material production was launched. Each campaign mobilized tens of thousands of people, led by the first secretaries of the Party committees at all levels, with all members of the municipal Party committee taking part. Doing so not only had a great effect and outstanding achievements because of the concentration of forces, the concentration of leadership, and the concentration of goals, which could complete tasks that were difficult to complete in normal times and overcome difficulties that were difficult to overcome in normal times; but also because what was grasped were the key issues at the time, which played a decisive role in driving the overall situation and boosting morale, thereby enabling the city to achieve the result of completing the annual national plan more than forty days ahead of schedule despite the shortage of raw material and fuel supply, and also made preparations for production in 1960 ahead of schedule.
    The leadership method of grasping the main contradictions, organizing superior forces, and fiercely attacking the key points is not only mastered by the municipal Party committee, but also adopted by most grassroots units in the city. Last year, the "key breakthrough battles" and "key competitions" organized by factories among workers were a concrete application of this leadership method. For example, the Universe Porcelain Factory, which was the first in our city to enter 1960, originally estimated that it would not be able to complete the annual plan, but because they organized five key breakthrough battles one after another based on the specific conditions of the factory (raw material and fuel barrier, transportation barrier, technical barrier, equipment barrier, quality barrier), they completed the national plan across the board sixty days ahead of schedule.
              Establish Banners, Use Points to Lead the Whole, Launch Competitions
    Any mass movement is not enough with just calls from above; there must also be concrete models created by the masses. This kind of model must be something that can reflect the development law of things and play a "guide" role in the movement. Grasping it and promoting it will give strength to the calls of the leadership, enrich the content of the movement, and overcome the generalized leadership style, putting one's work on a practical, reliable, and advanced foundation. In just over a year, Jingdezhen transformed a ceramic industry with a manual history of more than a thousand years and more than 30,000 workers from basic manual operation to mostly using mechanical or semi-mechanical operation under the conditions of very limited equipment and technology. One of the main reasons is that we seized a pacesetter who used indigenous methods to start, combining indigenous and foreign methods to vigorously develop mechanization - the Red Star Porcelain Factory.
    At the beginning of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, many people had superstitions, one-sidedly emphasizing the difficulties in materials, equipment, and technology. The leaders and workers of the Red Star Porcelain Factory were not like this. Their answer was: "If there are no materials, we can find them; if there is no equipment, we can make it; if there is no technology, we can learn it." In just a few months, they used porcelain, wood, and scrap iron to make dozens of machines. If they didn't know how to draw blueprints for making machines, they made models based on their ideas; if they didn't know how to calculate the speed for automation, they worked by feeling the turntable. If it was slow, they cut off a little; if it was fast, they added a little; if there was no power or belt, they used foot pedals. In the midst of such hard work, practical work, and clever work, they trained their own technical workers, their own designers, and established their own machine manufacturing workshop. In just a few months, they increased the degree of mechanization of the entire factory by two or three times. After we held an on-site meeting and promoted their advanced experience, a mass movement of "comparing with Red Star, learning from Red Star, catching up with Red Star" was quickly launched, and in only two or three months, many factories caught up.
    The purpose of grasping pacesetters is to get the movement going, to set off a high tide of production work, and to achieve an overall leap forward and common improvement. Therefore, with pacesetters, we must shout loudly, sound the gongs and drums for the pacesetters, and publicize them. In the era of the Great Leap Forward, heroes emerged in large numbers, and the banners of pacesetters were all over the place. Not only did the city have pacesetters, but every line of work had pacesetters, every unit had pacesetters, and even a production team or a production brigade had its own pacesetters. Grasping pacesetters requires organizing "compare, learn, catch up" movements, promoting them, and creating an atmosphere of "everyone striving to be upstream, everyone competing to be advanced." At this time, the leadership should also pay attention to "there is always someone better, there is always something better beyond the sky," and not stick to one point, holding onto the old pacesetters. The leadership's attention should advance with the advancement of the movement, constantly summarizing new experiences, establishing new pacesetters, and proposing new tasks. Since last year, we have been doing this, so that the movement has quickly swept every corner of the city. Not only workers, farmers, and street residents, but even retired workers and cattle herding children have participated in the competition, and have created many competition methods, such as "one dragon" and opponent competitions.
    Technical Revolution, Self-Reliance
    To maintain the enthusiasm of the masses and make the production upsurge rise higher and higher, it is not enough to rely solely on increasing labor intensity. In the midst of hard work, there must be clever work, vigorously promoting technical innovation and technical revolution. Last year, Jingdezhen was able to complete the annual national plan forty-four days ahead of schedule and achieve an unprecedented level of ceramic production capacity of more than 1.2 million pieces per day after withdrawing one-quarter of its labor force. An important reason is that it vigorously promoted technical innovation and technical revolution centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization.
    In 1959, Jingdezhen reformed more than 600 tools through mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements, including 256 major reforms, increasing work efficiency by one to 143 times. At present, the increased production capacity of the city's ceramic industry after improving the degree of mechanized forming is equivalent to adding a large porcelain factory with an annual output of 200,000 dan of porcelain, and building such a modern porcelain factory would take three to five years. In addition, transportation has basically achieved automobile towing, and construction enterprises have basically achieved vertical transportation winding, horizontal transportation vehicleization, trackization, and tool equipment innovation. Due to the continuous improvement of the degree of mechanization, it has not only opened up a broad road for the sustained leap forward of the city's national economy, but also greatly changed the working conditions of workers, making the enthusiasm of the masses more and more full, and everyone is energetic and full of fighting spirit.
    In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, our deepest understanding is that we must firmly establish the idea of self-reliance, implement the policy of walking on two legs, and be foreign if we can be foreign, and indigenous if we cannot be foreign. It is necessary to establish such guiding ideology because doing so: First, it can maximize the enthusiasm of the masses and concentrate the talents and wisdom of the masses in all aspects. Second, it can achieve mechanization more, faster, better, and more economically. Due to indigenous methods and the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, the masses can do it themselves, and the speed of mechanization can be greatly accelerated. Third, it can cultivate talents more, faster, better, and more economically. After last year's technical innovation and technical revolution movement, not only were many new industrial departments established on the flat ground, enriching the original weak links, but also a large number of technical forces and workers using mechanical operations were trained through learning, doing, and improving at the same time. They gained wisdom in the process of doing, learned a lot of things they didn't understand in the past, quickly mastered new technologies, and some have become technicians and designers.
                    Strike While the Iron is Hot, Do Not Miss the Opportunity
    Using the theory of continuous revolution to guide China's revolution and construction is an important experience for our cause to achieve great victory. In practical work, we feel that we must also use the idea of continuous revolution in order to always pay attention to discovering new problems, proposing new tasks, so that cadres and the masses will not become complacent and slack due to victory, and will move forward vigorously forever; we can take a step ahead, every step ahead, take a step proactively, every step proactively, and be able to seize another new victory with more certainty after one victory.
    After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the provincial Party committee meeting in August last year, the call to oppose rightism, boost morale, increase production, and practice economy has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Seizing this opportunity, we put forward the specific task of "fighting a major battle in August and September, breaking through the fuel barrier, doubling the output, and presenting a generous gift to the National Day" in industry. Following the great victories in industrial and agricultural production in August and September, we put forward the slogan of "working hard and working cleverly, surpassing September in October," and timely guided the selfless labor enthusiasm of the masses to the aspect of clever work, vigorously promoting tool reform and mechanization. In more than a month, the masses put forward more than 10,000 rationalization proposals for production, promoted advanced experience, and reformed more than 1,000 tools, and production efficiency rose sharply. Due to continuous victories, some cadres and the masses developed the idea of "taking a break." In response to this idea, we immediately conducted criticism and timely organized a "decisive battle in November, entering 1960 ahead of schedule" competition, making the enthusiasm of the masses greater and greater, and the production wave higher and higher. By November 18, the national plan was fully completed. In this way, we completed the road that normally takes seven months in three and a half months, which enabled us to free up our hands to do a good job in preparing for this year's production, so that this year started with a good start, every month was red, and the first quarter's industrial production task was overfulfilled. This proves that as long as we seize the opportunity, we will take the initiative; time is of decisive significance to us.

    认真总结经验实现持续跃进
    中共景德镇市委第一书记　赵渊
    景德镇这个以出产瓷器闻名全世界的城市，呈现着一片龙腾虎跃欣欣向荣的大好形势，技术革新和技术革命的风暴正在迅速地改变着这个古城的面貌。过去被人嘲笑为连一枚螺丝钉都找不到的陶瓷工业，现在大部分操作已经为机械所代替；在去年提前四十四天按质按量完成全部生产任务的基础上，今年第一季度，工业生产各项指标不但保持了去年第四季度水平，比去年同期增长了61％，而且已经提前超额完成。
    在技术革新和技术革命的浪潮一浪高过一浪的大好形势下，今年景德镇的陶瓷工业又将起一个飞跃的变化，在大量增产各种高级精美的日用瓷的同时，还将全面发展各种尖端的工业瓷、电瓷、建筑瓷和化学用瓷，陶瓷生产操作将基本上实现机械化和半机械化。适应着陶瓷工业技术大革命的需要，除现有机械、煤炭、建筑材料等工业将进一步加速发展外，还将本着土洋结合的办法，建立电机制造、钢铁、基本化工等新工业。这样，就可以全面地改变生产面貌，使景德镇的瓷器生产能够以更快的速度向前发展，比较充分地满足各方面日益增长的需要。
    要在短时期内完成这样的任务，肯定会有不少困难，但是我们却充满了必胜的信心。因为我们经过两年的连续大跃进，在贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线中，已经摸索和总结了一套比较完整的领导群众运动的经验。
                    全面规划　分期安排
    在总路线的鼓舞下，1959年我们根据全省的安排和我市的具体情况，提出在三、五年内把景德镇建设成为一个以瓷为主的、有机械、冶金、电力、煤炭、采矿、建筑材料、化学工业的完整的以现代化技术为基础的工业基地，以及以粮为主，粮、油、茶、果、木、禽畜、水产全面大发展的规划，并且按系统提出了保证分期实现这个总规划的具体规划。如以粉碎机械化、原料精制化等“四化”为中心的瓷业技术改造规划，以及与此相适应的建立机械工业、培养技术人材的规划，开发山区、大修公路、建立原料燃料供应基地的规划，等等。这样，有了总的规划，又有了按单位的分期规划，就把领导的意图和群众的要求结合了起来，对动员和组织群众起了很大的作用。特别是由于有了规划就有了中心，把各个方面的积极因素都调动起来，拧成一股绳，形成一支所向披靡无攻不克的坚强力量，因而加快了社会主义建设的速度。按我们原来的规划，要三年才能基本上实现瓷业生产的机械化和半机械化，现在可以提前一年完成。在短短的一年多时间内，我们建立了能够制造全部陶瓷机械的机械工业，训练了上万名能够使用机械操作、掌握新技术的工人，建立了自己的煤炭、原料供应基地，修建了纵横几百公里的交通运输线。
                  抓住关键　就要猛攻
    实现规划有两种不同的作法：一种是不分轻重缓急，齐头并进，全面展开，分兵把口；另一种是在不同时期抓住对全局有决定意义的关键，也就是抓住薄弱环节，集中优势兵力，组织猛攻，攻下一个再攻一个，干完一批再干一批。这两种不同的作法，产生两种不同的结果。前一种打的是消耗战，东放一枪，西放一枪，不仅打不中要害，而且会影响群众的积极性，使领导上陷于被动。后一种打的是歼灭战，可以做到纲举目张，高速跃进。景德镇在去年根据全年总规划，曾组织了三次大战役。6月到8月，针对当时原料燃料供应不足的情况，开展了一个以大搞原料燃料的生产和运输，攻克原料燃料关为中心的战役。9月到11月组织了一个以推广先进经验为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。11月到12月又开展了以大修水利、大修公路、大积肥料、大抓原材料生产准备为中心的群众运动。每次战役都出动数万人，由各级党委第一书记挂帅，市委委员全部上阵。这样做，不仅因为兵力集中、领导集中、目标集中而效果很大，成绩突出，可以完成平时难以完成的任务，克服平时难以克服的困难；而且因为所抓的都是当时带有关键性的问题，对带动全局、鼓舞士气起了决定性作用，从而使全市在原料燃料供应不足的情况下，取得了提前四十多天完成全年国家计划的成绩，还提前做好了1960年的生产准备工作。
    抓住主要矛盾，组织优势兵力，猛攻关键的领导方法，不但为市委所掌握，也为全市大部分基层单位所采用。去年各工厂在工人中组织的
  “攻关战”、“关键赛”，就是这一领导方法的具体运用。如去年我市第一个跨进1960年的宇宙瓷厂，原来估计完不成年计划，但是由于他们根据本厂的具体情况，先后组织了五次攻关战（原料燃料关、运输关、技术关、设备关、质量关），结果提前六十天全面完成了国家计划。
              树立旗帜　以点带面　开展竞赛
    任何一个群众运动，只有上面的号召是不够的，还必须有群众创造的具体样板。这种样板，必须是能够反映事物的发展规律并在运动中起
  “向导”作用的东西，抓住了它加以推广，领导上的号召就有了力量，就丰富了运动的内容，就可以克服一般化的领导作风，把自己的工作放在实际可靠而又先进的基础上。我市在短短的一年多的时间内，在设备、技术都非常缺乏的条件下，把一个有一千多年手工历史、有三万多名工人的陶瓷工业，由基本的手工操作一跃变为大部分使用机械或半机械操作，主要原因之一是我们抓住了一个使用土法上马、土洋结合大搞机械化的标兵——红星瓷厂。
    在技术革新和技术革命运动开展之初，不少人有迷信，片面地强调材料设备和技术等方面的困难，而红星瓷厂的领导和工人就不是这样，他们的回答是：“没有材料可以找，没有设备可以造，没有技术可以学”。在短短的几个月中，他们用瓷器、木头、废铁做成几十部机器。造机器不会画图纸，就根据设想做模型；搞自动化不会算转速，就摸着转盘干，慢了就切掉一点，快了就补上一点；没有动力、皮带，就用脚踏。就在这样穷干、实干加巧干的当中，他们培养了自己的技术工人、自己的设计师，成立了自己的机器制造车间，几个月就使全厂的机械化程度提高了两三倍。我们召开了现场会议，把他们的先进经验推广出去以后，很快就掀起了一个“比红星、学红星、赶红星”的群众运动，而且只有两三个月的功夫，很多厂就赶上了。
    抓标兵的目的是要把运动搞起来，把生产工作的高潮掀起来，达到全面跃进，共同提高。因此，有了标兵，就要大喊大叫，为标兵鸣锣喝道，宣传出去。在跃进年代，英雄辈出，标兵旗帜风云四起，不但全市有标兵，行行有标兵，单位有标兵，一个生产小组或一个生产队都有自己的标兵。抓住标兵，就要组织“比、学、赶”运动，推广开去，造成一种“人人争上游，个个比先进”的气氛，而这时领导上又要注意“强中还有强中手，天外还有天外天”，不能孤守一点，抓住老标兵不放。领导的注意力要随着运动的前进而前进，不断总结新的经验，树立新的标兵，提出新的任务。去年以来，我们正是这样作的，因而使运动很快地就席卷了全市的每一个角落，不但工人、农民、街道居民甚至退休工人、放牛小孩也参加了竞赛，并且创造了许多竞赛的方法，如“一条龙”、对手赛等。
    技术革命　自力更生
    要把群众的干劲坚持下去，使生产高潮一浪高过一浪，单靠增加劳动强度是不行的，在苦干当中必须有巧干，大闹技术革新和技术革命。去年景德镇能够在抽出四分之一劳动力的情况下，提前四十四天完成全年国家计划，瓷器生产能力达到日产一百二十多万件的空前水平，一个重要原因是大抓了以机械化和半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命。
    1959年，景德镇通过群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，先后改革工具六百多项，其中重大改革有二百五十六项，工效提高一倍至一百四十三倍。目前全市陶瓷工业成型机械化程度提高后增加的生产能力，相当于新增加了一个年产二十万担瓷器的大瓷厂，而新建一个这样的现代化瓷厂，需要三年到五年的时间。此外，交通运输也基本实现了汽车拖斗化，基建企业基本实现了垂直运输卷扬化、水平运输车子化、轨道化、工具设备革新化。由于机械化程度的不断提高，不但为我市国民经济的持续跃进开辟了一条宽阔的道路，也大大地改变了工人的劳动条件，使群众的干劲越来越足，一个个精神振奋，斗志昂扬。
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，我们体会最深的是要坚决树立自力更生的思想，执行两条腿走路的方针，能洋就洋，不能洋就土。树立这样的指导思想所以必要，是因为这样做：第一，可以最大限度地调动群众的积极性，把群众中各方面的人材和智慧都集中起来。第二，可以多快好省地实现机械化。由于土法上马、土洋结合，群众可以自己动手，机械化的速度就能大大加快。第三，可以多快好省地培养人材。经过去年一年的技术革新、技术革命运动，不但在平地上建立了许多新的工业部门，充实了原来的薄弱环节，并且通过边学、边做、边提高，培养了大批技术力量和使用机械操作的工人。他们在干的当中得到智慧，学会了很多过去所不了解的东西，很快地掌握了新技术，有的人已成了技术员、设计师。
                    趁热打铁　不误时机
    用不断革命的理论来指导中国的革命和建设，是我们的事业获得伟大胜利的一条重要经验。在实际工作中，我们感到同样必须运用不断革命的思想，才能经常注意发现新问题，提出新任务，使干部和群众不致因胜利而自满松劲，朝气蓬勃地永远前进；才可以做到一步提前，步步提前，一步主动，步步主动，能够在一个胜利以后更有把握地去夺取另一个新的胜利。
    在去年8月中共八中全会和省委会议以后，反右倾、鼓干劲，增产节约的号召已深入人心。抓住这一时机，我们在工业上提出了“大战8、9月，突破燃料关，产量加一番，厚礼献国庆”的具体任务。继8、9月工农业生产大捷以后，我们又提出了“苦干加巧干，10月超9月”的口号，适时地把群众的忘我劳动热情引到巧干这方面来，大搞工具改革，大搞机械化。在一个多月中，群众提出改革生产的合理化建议一万多件，推广先进经验、改革工具达一千多项，生产效率猛步上升。由于连续胜利，这时有些干部和群众产生了“歇一口气”的思想。针对这一思想，我们立即进行了批判，并及时组织了“决战11月，提前跨进1960年”的竞赛活动，使群众的干劲越来越大，生产浪潮愈来愈高，到11月18日就全面完成了国家计划。这样，我们就以三个半月的时间走完了平常要七个月才可以走完的路，使我们有可能抽出手来做好今年的生产准备工作，使今年一开始就做到开门红、月月红，超额完成了第一季度工业生产任务。这就证明，只要我们抓住了时机，就掌握了主动；时间，对我们来讲有决定的意义。
