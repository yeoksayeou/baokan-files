Xinhua News Agency, 14th - The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram on the 13th to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," stating that just as the Japanese people cannot forget the disasters of World War II, the Chinese workers and people vividly remember the calamities brought by Japanese militarism in the past decades, especially during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. The telegram said: "Chinese workers and people vow to fight alongside the Japanese people to the end to smash the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to plan a new war in the Far East."

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions expressed firm support and high respect in the telegram to the Japanese workers and people who are holding the unprecedented 16th unified action. The telegram pointed out that the words and deeds of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, as well as the recent deliberations in the Diet, nakedly expose that the U.S.-Japan military alliance is an enemy of the people of Asia and the world and aims to push the Japanese people into the abyss of a new war disaster. Japanese territory and its military forces have been used to engage in aggressive and provocative actions against China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries. The telegram described the grand rallies of nine million people in major cities across China starting from May 9th to support the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S., and to condemn the U.S.-Japan reactionaries for plotting new war conspiracies.

The telegram said: "In the situation where the East wind is increasingly prevailing over the West wind, and the people of the world are increasingly awakened, U.S. imperialism has become the target of public condemnation and is being beaten everywhere in the world. The 650 million Chinese people resolutely support the struggle of the Japanese people. No matter how desperately the U.S.-Japan reactionaries struggle, victory will surely belong to the heroic Japanese people!"

    日美军事同盟是与人民为敌
    全总致电支持日本人民阻止修改日美“安全条约”
    新华社14日讯　中华全国总工会13日打电报给日本工会总评议会和日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议说，正如日本人民不能忘怀第二次世界大战的灾祸一样，中国工人和人民对于日本军国主义过去数十年中特别是八年侵华战争中带来的灾难记忆犹新。电报说：“中国工人与人民誓与日本人民一道，为粉碎美日反动派在远东策划新战争的阴谋而斗争到底。”
    全总在电报中对正在举行空前规模的第十六次统一行动的日本工人和人民表示坚决的支持和崇高的敬意。电报指出，美日反动派的言行以及最近的国会审议，赤裸裸地暴露出日美军事同盟是与亚洲和全世界人民为敌，是要把日本人民推向新战争灾难的深渊。日本领土及其军事力量已被利用来从事对中、苏和其它亚洲国家的侵略挑衅行动。电报叙述了从5月9日起在我国各重要城市的九百万人隆重集会支持日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争、谴责美日反动派策划新战争阴谋的情况。
    电报说：“在东风愈加压倒西风，全世界人民日益觉醒的形势下，美帝国主义已成为众矢之的，在全世界到处挨打。中国六亿五千万人民坚决支持日本人民的斗争。不管美日反动派如何绝望挣扎，胜利一定属于英勇斗争的日本人民！”
