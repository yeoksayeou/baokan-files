Sichuan Launches "Ten Thousand Dragons" Transportation Movement
Automobiles and fleets break regional and river boundaries; materials are transported directly to Leshan Prefecture's steel, coal mines. Steel, coal, mining, and transportation departments jointly contract for production and transport to promote increased steel production.

Chengdu, May 26th (By Our Correspondent) - Sichuan Province, in order to improve transportation efficiency and ensure the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, is vigorously promoting communist collaboration within and outside the region, connecting production, supply, transport, and sales into one force, and launching the "Ten Thousand Dragons" water and land transportation movement. Currently, the province has formed more than eight thousand nine hundred "one-dragon" transportation lines, initially forming a transportation collaboration network with crisscrossing trunk and branch lines. At the beginning of this year, Sichuan Province, based on the principle of combining large, medium, and small sizes, combining points and surfaces, ensuring key points, and taking care of the overall situation, comprehensively arranged a large-scale transportation collaboration within the province: Automobile transportation, with Chongqing, Chengdu, Luzhou, and Ya'an as the center, organized four large regional collaboration networks; water transportation, with Chongqing, Hechuan, Luzhou, Hejiang, Yibin, Fuling as the center, with the Jialing River, Fujiang River, Qujiang River, Minjiang River, Tuojiang River, Wujiang River, and Sheshui River seven water systems as the backbone, forming a water transportation collaboration network, and through hub ports and stations connected with highways and railways, forming a water and land transportation network running through the province. At the same time, the short-distance branch lines of special districts, counties, and people's communes are also organized into collaborative one-dragon lines. In this way, long-distance and short-distance, trunk lines and branch lines, waterways and land routes, modern transportation tools and folk transportation tools, ports and stations and ships are linked into a continuous dragon-like transportation line.

The characteristic of this "Ten Thousand Dragons" transportation movement is: from the collaboration between transportation departments, it has developed into collaboration between production, supply, transport, and sales; from the collaboration of one point, one line, and one region, it has developed into a large-scale collaboration of multiple points, multiple lines, and multiple aspects of production, supply, transport, and sales; from transportation collaboration, it has developed into a comprehensive collaboration of technological revolution, fuel supply, and vehicle repair. For example, in automobile transportation and water transportation, the province has promoted "one-dragon" direct automobile transportation and Red Flag fleets, breaking regional and river boundaries, so that materials are transported from the starting point to the end point in one go, without transshipment in the middle. In this way, the efficiency of vehicle and ship transportation can generally be increased by half to one time compared with the past, and it can also save manpower and equipment for material transshipment, and avoid damage to materials during transshipment. Leshan Prefecture, on the basis of the original regional comprehensive "one-dragon" transportation collaboration, further carried out a larger-scale and more extensive mass-based joint production and transport "one-dragon" collaboration. They took the four steel plants of Qianghua, Leshan, Wutongqiao, and Zhongchuan as the core, organized the four departments of steel, coal, mining, and transportation to jointly compete for high production to achieve the special district's daily output of 1,000 tons of iron, so that the large-scale collaboration and competition within the transportation department was closely combined with the external large-scale collaboration and competition, which not only ensured the high production of steel, but also promoted the continuous leap forward of transportation. Since Leshan Prefecture implemented the joint production and transport collaboration, the average daily output of pig iron has increased from more than 800 tons to more than 1,100 tons; the monthly output per ton of automobile has reached more than 40,000 ton-kilometers, an increase of about three times compared with December last year; the berthing time of wooden boats has been shortened from an average of 36 hours in the past to 12 hours; the loading and unloading efficiency has increased by 1.5 times compared with the past, and the whole district has achieved no iron storage in factories and no coke storage in mines, with production and transportation following each other.

With the development of the "Ten Thousand Dragons" transportation movement, many units have also carried out corresponding reforms in enterprise management, production organization, labor allocation, and material supply systems. For example, in the past, the transportation departments in the Mianyang area were all independent and had their own systems. Some units transporting materials, with a transport distance of only three kilometers, had to go through nine procedures and sign more than ten documents, resulting in the accumulation of two or thirty thousand tons of materials at the railway station that could not be transported in time. After carrying out the "Ten Thousand Dragons" transportation collaboration, they mobilized the masses to reform various systems that hinder collaboration, established new systems that are conducive to collaboration, implemented unified production, transportation, and sales, unified planning and schedules, etc., which improved transportation efficiency and accelerated material turnover.

### 四川开展运输“万条龙”运动

    地区内外组织协作网产供运销拧成一股绳                                                            
    四川开展运输“万条龙”运动
    汽车、船队打破地区、江河界限，物资不经换装一次运到乐山专区钢煤矿山交通四部门联合包产包运促进钢铁增产
    本报成都26日电　四川省为了提高运输效率，保证工农业生产的跃进，正在大搞地区内外共产主义协作，把产供运销拧成一股绳，开展水陆运输“万条龙”运动。目前，全省已经组成八千九百多条“一条龙”运输线，初步形成了一个干线支线纵横交错的交通运输协作网。今年年初，四川省就根据大中小结合，点面结合，保证重点，照顾全面的方针，全面安排了省内水陆交通运输的大协作：汽车运输以重庆、成都、泸州、雅安为中心，组织了四个大片区的协作网；水上运输以重庆、合川、泸州、合江、宜宾、涪陵为中心，以嘉陵江、涪江、渠江、岷江、沱江、乌江、赦水河七条水系为骨干，组成水上运输协作网，并通过枢纽港、站与公路、铁路衔接，构成贯通全省的水陆运输网。同时，把专区、县、人民公社的短途支线也组成协作一条龙。这样，就使长途与短途、干线与支线、水路与陆路、近代运输工具与民间运输工具、港站与轮船之间，联成一条连续不断的龙网化运输线。
    这个运输“万条龙”运动的特点是：从运输部门之间的协作，发展到产、供、运、销之间的协作；从一点一线一个区的协作，发展为多点多线多方面的产、供、运、销大协作；从运输协作发展到技术革命、燃料供应、车船修理的全面协作。例如在汽车运输和水上运输方面，全省都推行了“一条龙”直达汽车运输和红旗船队，打破地区和江河界限，使物资从起点到终点一次运到，中途不再换装。这样，车船运输效率一般可比过去提高半倍到一倍，还可以节约物资中转的人力和设备，避免了物资中转时的损坏现象。乐山专区还在原有地区综合“一条龙”运输大协作的基础上，进一步开展了一个规模更大、群众性更为广泛的联合包产、包运“一条龙”大协作。他们以强华、乐山、五通桥、中川四个钢铁厂为核心，组织钢铁、煤炭、矿山、交通四个部门共同为实现全专区日产千吨铁的协作高产竞赛，使交通部门内部大协作、大竞赛，与外部大协作、大竞赛紧密结合起来，既保证了钢铁生产的高产，又促进了交通运输的持续跃进。乐山专区实行联合包产、包运大协作以来，生铁平均日产量已由原来八百多吨提高到一千一百多吨；汽车车吨月产达到四万多吨公里，比去年12月提高了三倍左右；木船停港时间由过去平均三十六小时缩短到十二小时；装卸效率比过去提高一点五倍，全区做到了厂不存铁、矿不存焦，随产随运。
    许多单位随着运输“万条龙”运动的发展，在企业管理、生产组织、劳动调配、材料供应等制度方面，也进行了相应的改革。如绵阳地区过去运输部门都是各立门户，各有制度。有的单位托运物资，只有三公里运距，却要办理九道手续，签具十多张单据，致使火车站经常积压着两三万吨物资不能及时运走。开展“万条龙”运输大协作以后，他们发动群众改革了妨碍协作的各种制度，建立了有利于协作的新制度，实行产、运、销统一，计划、班次统一等，提高了运输效率，加速了物资周转。
