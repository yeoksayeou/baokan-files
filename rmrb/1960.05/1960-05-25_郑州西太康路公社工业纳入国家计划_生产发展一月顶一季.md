Zhengzhou Xitaikang Road Commune Industry Incorporated into National Plan
Production Development One Month Equals One Quarter

(Our dispatch) The Xitaikang Road People's Commune in the Erqi District of Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, starting from solving the problems of raw materials and sales, has rationally adjusted its various commune-run factories, enabling production to quickly enter the orbit of the national plan. Over the past year, the industrial landscape of the entire commune has undergone tremendous changes, with the output value doubling continuously. The total output value in the first quarter of this year was equivalent to the total output value of the entire last year. The total output value in April exceeded that of the first quarter of this year by more than 40,000 yuan, thus achieving unprecedented development of "one quarter equals one year, one month equals one quarter."

The Xitaikang Road People's Commune is organized mainly by residents of 105 natural streets. During the upsurge of the whole people running industry in July 1958, the street residents established 1,063 factories in a short period of three days. However, these factories were small in scale, with each factory generally having only three to five people. Not only were the locations scattered and management difficult, but there were also many problems in terms of raw materials and sales. There was an urgent need to rectify and improve them so that production could be brought into the orbit of the national plan as soon as possible. In the process of adjustment, the commune's Party committee contacted the Zhengzhou City National Planning Department, commercial departments, and relevant state-owned and local state-owned large factories to grasp the market supply and demand and the laws governing the sources of raw materials. The following five methods were adopted to rectify the various factories under its jurisdiction:

First, some factories with sufficient raw materials and broad sales channels, such as small hardware factories, sulfuric acid factories, and various small commodity factories, were merged and expanded. Leading cadres were assigned, and various work systems were established and improved. Appropriate support was also provided in terms of funds, equipment, and technology.

Second, for some products that the commune had never produced before but were urgently needed in the market, and for which relevant departments were willing to provide a large amount of raw materials, such as spindles, marking chalk, and calcium carbide, the commune Party committee immediately sent people to other places and factories to learn production technology or invited technicians to actively prepare for the construction of new factories or add new workshops in one factory.

Third, for some factories with good sales channels but limited sources of materials, such as shoe factories, the basic situation was maintained. Production was carried out according to the raw materials supplied according to the plan, and substitutes were actively sought in order to expand production where possible.

Fourth, for some factories that were restricted by seasons, such as clothing factories, or occasionally encountered difficulties in raw materials or sales, but had long-term development prospects, such as bamboo ware factories, the commune Party committee enabled these factories to adopt methods such as mobile services, decentralized trips to the countryside to find production opportunities, or temporarily change to other products during the off-season or when encountering temporary difficulties, to maintain production and actively expand production.

Fifth, for a small number of factories with difficulties in raw materials, sluggish sales, and little prospect for development, production was stopped, and manpower and materials were transferred to urgently needed factories.

After reasonable adjustments, by the end of last year, the entire commune had merged from the initial 1,063 small factories into 75 large factories with dozens or even hundreds of people. Most of these factories have established close ties with state-owned industry, commerce, and national planning departments through various forms such as processing and exclusive sales. Raw material sources belonging to state-owned industrial and commercial departments for processing accounted for 59%, using waste materials and scraps from large factories accounted for 9.5%, and other self-produced and self-raised raw materials by the commune. More than 80% of the products are sold exclusively by state-owned commercial departments. For example, the raw materials for the chemical plant to manufacture soap are allocated by the Municipal Bureau of Light Industry, and the production plan is also formulated by the Municipal Planning Department. The cotton yarn required for the spindle factory to produce spindles is supplied by the Municipal Bureau of Commerce, and the production plan is issued by the Provincial Planning Commission. In this way, the entire commune-run industry has rapidly entered the orbit of the national plan from raw materials to sales.

After establishing close ties and processing and exclusive sales relationships with state-owned industry and commerce, the commune-run industry of Xitaikang Road People's Commune not only obtained sufficient raw material sources ranging from steel, chemical raw materials, cotton yarn and cotton cloth, silk, to scrap copper, scrap iron, and scraps, but also received strong support from state-owned industrial and commercial departments in terms of production equipment and technical guidance. Over the past year, the commune-run industry has used scraps and waste materials from large factories to produce more than 200 kinds of small commodities and small hardware products, such as trouser hooks, hairpins, thimbles, embroidery needles, shoe straps, shoe soles, carton nails, etc., to meet the needs of the broad masses of people in their lives. It has also produced various mechanical parts, caustic soda, sulfuric acid, calcium carbide, and other large quantities of products to supply industrial production.

Due to the reasonable adjustment of commune-run industry, various production avenues that meet social needs have been found. Many small factories have developed into prosperous large factories in a short period of time. Capital accumulation has increased exponentially, equipment has been continuously improved, and the cultural and technical level of workers has also been rapidly improved. In order to meet the urgent need in society for a large number of complex industrial products, since February this year, the Xitaikang Road People's Commune has absorbed another 644 people and established 16 factories. The number of workers has increased to 3,884 (more than 80% of whom are housewives). Including personnel occupied in living welfare aspects, all the whole and semi-idle labor force within the entire commune has almost all participated in production.

With the production tasks increasing exponentially and a severe shortage of labor, a mass-based, vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution wave swept through all production and living departments of the entire commune. Since the beginning of this year, the number of people participating in technical innovation in the entire commune has increased to 3,560, a total of more than 59,000 rationalization proposals have been put forward, 163 major innovations have been realized, saving 570 laborers and saving 25,900 yuan in funds. With the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, many factories have accepted more new production tasks and expanded the scale of the factories.

    郑州西太康路公社工业纳入国家计划
    生产发展一月顶一季
    本报讯　河南省郑州市二七区西太康路人民公社从解决原料、销路入手，合理调整了各个社办工厂，使生产迅速纳入国家计划轨道。一年多来，全社工业面貌日新月异，产值连续翻番：今年第一季度的总产值相当于去年全年的总和；4月份的总产值，又超出今年第一季度四万多元，从而获得了“一季顶一年，一月顶一季”史无前例的大发展。
    西太康路人民公社，是以一百零五条自然街的街道居民为主组织起来的。在1958年7月全民大办工业高潮中，街道居民在短短三天时间内，便创办起来一千零六十三个工厂。但是这些工厂规模很小，每个厂一般只有三、五个人，不仅住处分散，管理困难，在原料、销路方面也存在许多问题，迫切要求整顿提高，使生产尽快纳入国家计划轨道。在调整过程中，公社党委先后和郑州市国家计划部门、商业部门以及各有关国营、地方国营大厂挂勾，掌握了市场供求和原料来源等的情况规律，分别采取以下五种方法对所属各个工厂进行整顿：
    第一，对原料充足、产品销路广阔的一些工厂，如小五金厂、硫酸厂和各种小百货厂等进行合并、扩建，配备了领导骨干，建立与健全了各项工作制度。在资金、设备、技术等方面，也给予了适当支援。
    第二，对公社从未生产过但市场上迫切需要、有关部门又愿意提供大量原材料的一些产品，如轴线、划粉、电石等，公社党委便立即派人到外地外厂学习生产技术或请技术人员，积极筹建新厂或在一个工厂内增设新的车间。
    第三，对产品销路好，但是材料来源有限制的一些工厂，如鞋厂等，基本上维持原状，按照计划供应的原材料进行生产，并积极寻找代用品，以便在可能的情况下扩大生产。
    第四，对受季节限制的一些工厂，如被服厂等，或偶而遇到原料或销路等方面的困难，但有长远发展前途的一些工厂，如竹器厂，公社党委便使这些厂在淡季或碰到临时困难的时候，采用流动服务，分散下乡寻找生产门路或暂时改作其它产品等方法，维持生产，并积极扩大生产。
    第五，对少数原料困难、销路不畅、发展前途不大的工厂，便停止生产，并把人力物力转移到迫切需要的工厂。
    经过合理调整，到去年年底全社已由最初的一千零六十三个小工厂，合并成为七十五个数十人以至数百人的大工厂。这些工厂大都通过各种形式和国营工业、商业以及国家计划部门，建立了加工、包销等紧密的联系。原料来源属于国营工商部门来料加工的占59％，属于利用大厂下脚料、废料的占9.5％，其它为公社自产自筹原料；80％以上的产品，由国营商业部门统一包销。例如化工厂制造肥皂的原料，是由市轻工业局调拨，生产计划也由市计划部门制定；轴线厂生产轴线需要的棉纱，由市商业局供给，生产计划是省计划委员会下达的。这样全社社办工业，从原料到销路便迅速纳入了国家计划轨道。
    在和国营工业、商业建立了密切联系和加工包销的关系后，西太康路人民公社社办工业不仅得到了上自钢材、化工原料、棉纱棉布、绸缎，下至废铜烂铁、下脚料等充足的原材料来源，在生产设备、技术指导等方面，也受到了国营工商部门的大力支援。一年多来，全社社办工业利用大厂下脚料、废料生产了二百多种小百货、小五金产品，如裤勾、发卡、顶针、绣针、鞋绊、鞋掌、纸箱钉等，满足了广大人民生活上的需要；还生产了各种机械零件、烧碱、硫酸、电石等大量产品，供应了工业生产。
    由于社办工业经过合理调整，找到了切合社会需要的各种生产门路，许多小工厂在短短时间内便发展成为兴隆昌盛的大工厂，资金积累成倍增加，设备不断完善，工人文化技术水平也迅速提高。为了尽量满足社会上迫切需要的、品种复杂的大量的工业用品，从今年2月份起，西太康路人民公社又吸收了六百四十四人，创办了十六个工厂，工人增加到三千八百八十四人（其中80％以上是家庭妇女）。加上生活福利方面占用的人员，全公社范围内所有的整、半闲散劳力，已经接近全部参加生产。
    在生产任务成倍增加，劳力奇缺的情况下，一个群众性的轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命浪潮，席卷全公社各个生产、生活部门。今年以来，全公社参加技术革新的人数已增加到三千五百六十人，共提出各种合理化建议五万九千多条，实现重大革新一百六十三项，节省劳力五百七十人，节约资金二万五千九百多元。随着技术革新和技术革命运动的开展，又使许多工厂接受了更多的新的生产任务，扩大了工厂规模。
