	Drive the American Scoundrels Out of Turkey!
		Xiao San
	Turkey, how many years have you been asleep! I know, you have never fallen asleep. It was Menderes who told you to lie still, to obediently sleep and sleep again. He wouldn't let you raise your head, he wanted you to close your eyes, so you wouldn't see the American master's chain—the chain that led him by the nose.
	But now Istanbul has awakened, Izmir, Ankara... have awakened, all of Turkey has awakened—everywhere are angry roars, everywhere are erupting volcanoes! The first spring of the sixties is truly extraordinary: good news is seen at every doorway when the spring thunder sounds.
	Look, the "democratic showcase" of the "free world" has already become a pile of shattered glass. Turkey, this "free and democratic testing ground," will also be thoroughly cleansed by the people's angry waves.
	The so-called "great patriot" Syngman Rhee was dragged through the streets by the Korean people—like a dead dog! The so-called "freedom fighter" Menderes, does he think the Turkish people will let you have a good death?
	This dictator of the "sister republic" is just an American-raised running dog and traitor. Don't even think the thrones of all reactionary murderers will be "stable," the volcanoes beneath your feet are about to erupt—like a chain reaction.
	Down with American imperialism! Down with the number one enemy of mankind!
	Brave Turkish people! Hold high the banner of independence and freedom!
	Drive the American scoundrels out!
	The 650 million Chinese people will always firmly support you!

    把美国佬赶出土耳其！
    萧三土耳其，你睡了多少年岁！我知道，你从来没有入睡。是曼德列斯叫你躺着不动，叫你伏伏贴贴地睡了再睡。他不叫你抬起头来，他要你合上双眼，使你看不见美国主子那条锁
  链，——牵着他鼻子走的那条锁链。但是现在伊斯坦布尔醒来了，伊兹密尔、安卡拉……醒来了，全土耳其都醒来了，——到处是愤怒的吼声，到处是喷口的火山！六十年代第一个春天真不平
  常：春雷响处家家门口都见双喜。看那“自由世界”的“民主橱
  窗”，已经成了一堆粉碎的玻璃。土耳其这块“自由民主试验场”
  呀，也将被人民的怒涛彻底冲洗。所谓“伟大的爱国者”李承晚，被朝鲜人民倒拖在街上走——像一条死狗！所谓“自由战士”曼德列斯，难道土耳其人民能让你得个好
  死？这个“姊妹共和国”的独裁者，只是美国豢养的走狗和卖国
  贼。一切反动凶手的宝座休想“稳
  定”，你们脚下的火山都要爆发——
  就像连锁反应。打倒美国帝国主义！打倒人类头号死敌！英勇的土耳其人民！高举独立自由的大旗！把美国佬赶出去！六亿五千万中国人永远坚决支持你！
