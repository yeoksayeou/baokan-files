Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch from New York: The "New York Times" published an editorial on April 30th regarding the Turkish students' struggle against Menderes' dictatorial rule, urging the Turkish army to continue acting as a tool of the Menderes government to suppress student demonstrations. The "New York Times" stated that the "current key to the Turkish situation undoubtedly lies in the Turkish...excellent army." The newspaper praised the army, which has been constantly used to suppress student demonstrations, saying that the Turkish army "has always been loyal to the government, and as long as the army maintains this situation, there will be no revolution..."

The newspaper also tried to minimize the significance of the Turkish students' struggle, stating in its headline editorial titled "Two Fortresses of the West" that people should not be "too blinded by superficial similarities and think that the developments in these two places (South Korea and Turkey) are more than just coincidences."

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch: The Turkish people's struggle against Menderes' dictatorial rule continues to alarm American and British newspapers.

The "New York Herald Tribune" editorial on April 30th believes that there are "similarities" between the events in Turkey and South Korea. The editorial uneasily states, "The United States will certainly view what is happening with great unease." The editorial claims that "Turkey is an integral part of the Western alliance, and our (American) contribution to Turkey's military and economic strength has been enormous." The newspaper urged the Turkish reactionary government to intensify the suppression of the people, demanding that the Menderes government "pay attention" to the developments in South Korea and "learn appropriate lessons from it."

The British "Daily Telegraph" editorial on April 30th stated that the Turkish people's demonstration occurring when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council was meeting in Istanbul was a "grim irony" to the meeting. The editorial called on the Turkish government and opposition parties to "step back from the brink before it is too late" to prevent the Turkish people's struggle against dictatorial rule from developing into a "revolution."

    美报要土耳其政府加紧镇压活动
    唯恐曼德列斯遭到和李承晚同样的命运
    新华社1日讯　纽约消息：“纽约时报”4月30日就土耳其学生反对曼德列斯独裁统治的斗争发表一篇社论，要土耳其的军队继续充当曼德列斯政府的工具来镇压学生的示威。“纽约时报”说，土耳其局势的“当前的关键所在无疑的在于土耳其的……出色的军队”。这家报纸夸奖不断被用来镇压学生示威的军队说，土耳其的军队“一直是忠于政府的，只要军队保持这种情况，就不会有革命……”。
    这家报纸还力图缩小土耳其学生的斗争的意义，它在这篇题为“西方的两个堡垒”的头条社论中要人们不应该为所谓“过于为表面上的类似所蒙蔽，而认为这两个地方（南朝鲜和土耳其）的事态发展还不止于是巧合”。
    新华社2日讯　土耳其人民反对曼德列斯独裁统治的斗争继续使美英报纸惶恐不安。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”4月30日的社论认为土耳其和南朝鲜的事态有着“类似之处”。社论不安地说，“美国当然将以很大的不安来看待正在发生的事”。社论说什么“土耳其是西方联盟不可分割的部分，而我们（美国）对土耳其军事和经济力量的贡献一直是巨大的”。这家报纸督促土耳其反动政府加紧镇压人民，它要求曼德列斯政府“注意”南朝鲜的事态发展，“从中吸取适当的教训”。
    英国“每日电讯报”4月30日社论说，土耳其人民的示威发生在北大西洋集团理事会在伊斯坦布尔开会的时候是对会议的一个“冷酷的讽刺”。社论要求土耳其政府和反对党在“时间还不太迟之前从边缘上走回来”以免土耳其人民反对独裁统治的斗争发展成为“革命”。
