Editorial: Vegetable Production Must Be Tightly Grasped Season After Season

　　Spring vegetables are already on the market in large quantities, and the peak season for summer vegetable production is about to arrive. In this great season for vegetable production, appropriately expanding the planting area for summer vegetables, striving to produce more and better vegetables, and further meeting the growing needs of the vast urban and rural population is an important task on the current agricultural production front.

　　The national vegetable production situation this year is extremely good, which can be summarized as: more, earlier, better, and more detailed. The supply of vegetables in the first quarter of this year has increased compared with the same period last year, and the vegetable planting area has also generally expanded. According to statistics from 32 large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, the planned vegetable planting area this year has expanded by about 30% compared with 1959; the planned vegetable planting area in 23 provinces and regions such as Henan and Hebei has also expanded by about 35% compared with 1959. All regions have paid more attention to vegetable production this year than in previous years, and have generally achieved early sowing, early seedling cultivation, early transplanting and setting of seedlings, and early marketing. When arranging vegetable production this year, many regions have not only expanded the planting quantity, but also significantly increased the variety of vegetables compared with last year. Many Party committees have grasped the leadership of vegetable production tightly and meticulously, not only effectively arranging the annual production and supply plan, but also arranging the quarterly and monthly production and supply plans; not only arranging the production of commercial vegetables, but also arranging the production of self-consumption vegetables for commune members and vegetable seeds. These situations fully demonstrate that China's vegetable production this year will greatly increase compared with last year, and the vegetable supply will be further improved.

　　However, we cannot therefore think that our vegetable production work has been done sufficiently. The so-called "good" is in comparison with the past. We should look at problems from a developmental perspective. Although China's vegetable production has greatly increased in the past few years, especially since last year, and the situation on the vegetable production front this year is very good, it still cannot fully meet the needs of the vast urban and rural people's improved living standards and the development of industrial and agricultural production. Vegetables contain many nutrients that are not found in grains. No matter when, vegetables are an important non-staple food in people's lives, which can not only increase nutrition but also save grains. Moreover, in the event of disasters, vegetables can also supplement the shortage of grains. Last year, one-third of China's cultivated land suffered from varying degrees of drought and flood disasters. Although we relied on the collective strength of the people's communes to overcome the natural disasters and achieved a bumper harvest nationwide, grain production in some areas was still reduced. In these areas, we should plant more and more vegetables early for people to eat. In particular, after two consecutive years of great leap forward, on the one hand, people's living standards have been further improved, and the demand for vegetables is increasing. On the other hand, with the high-speed development of the national socialist construction cause, the urban population has increased rapidly, and new cities and industrial and mining areas have emerged continuously, requiring the agricultural sector to produce more and better vegetables to meet the needs of urban and industrial and mining area residents. This is an important measure to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and a glorious task for agriculture to support national construction. Secondly, vegetables are a crop with high yields and rapid growth. The large-scale development of vegetable production can not only greatly improve people's lives, but also solve the difficulty of insufficient feed and promote the faster development of animal husbandry. China's animal husbandry, especially pig breeding, has undergone rapid development since last year. By the end of 1959, the number of pigs in stock had reached 180 million, and the number of pigs raised this year will increase by 35% compared with last year. Melons and vegetables are a good feed and should be planted in large quantities to meet the needs of the great development of pig breeding.

　　Planting more vegetables, especially seizing the current peak season for vegetable production to plant more summer vegetables, is an important issue in current vegetable production. All regions where the vegetable production plan has not been fully implemented should quickly and specifically implement it, and implement the plan to the fields and assign responsibilities to individuals as much as possible. All regions where insufficient vegetables are planted should try to plant more. Like other crops, planting sufficient area is the first key to ensuring a bumper harvest. Only when the planting area is guaranteed can the foundation be laid for a bumper harvest of vegetables. When arranging the vegetable planting area, it is necessary to ensure the completion of the state's commercial vegetable planting plan, as well as the planting plan for the self-consumption of vegetables by the vast number of commune members. Some suburban areas of cities attach great importance to the planting of commercial vegetables, but the self-consumption vegetable plan for commune members is not arranged effectively enough. These regions should appropriately expand the area for self-consumption vegetables for commune members. For vegetable seed land, it is also necessary to stipulate the necessary area specifically for seed collection and retention. At the same time, we should use vacant land to plant as many fodder crops such as melons as possible. In short, it is necessary to ensure that there is sufficient vegetable planting area, and vegetable production must not be squeezed out because of increasing the planting of grain and industrial raw material crops. At present, some emerging cities and industrial and mining areas cannot fully self-supply vegetables. In addition to providing certain support from other regions, these regions must boost their energy, overcome difficulties, and expand the vegetable sowing area as much as possible to gradually achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables. Rural people's communes and production teams with conditions should plant commercial vegetables according to the national plan, and at the same time, should vigorously develop vegetable production with public canteens as the center, so as to achieve complete self-sufficiency in vegetables and ensure that commune members can eat enough fresh vegetables every day. This is an extremely important measure to improve the lives of commune members and run canteens well. Rural commune members and institutions, factories, groups, and schools can also use private plots, wasteland, open spaces, and various scattered land in front of and behind houses to plant melons and vegetables in large quantities, and everyone can solve the problem of eating vegetables.

　　While expanding the vegetable planting area, it is also necessary to strive to increase the yield per unit area. An effective way to increase the yield per unit area is to make full use of the land and increase the area of intercropping and relay cropping. In the arrangement of vegetable field stubble, attention should be paid to using different varieties, one stubble after another, to maximize the number of replantings. Advanced units in Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and other places in the south have replanted more than ten times a year; Jiezhou Commune in Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province, in the north, adopted mixed planting, alternate row cultivation, and seedling transplanting last year to achieve eight crops and seven harvests and six crops and six harvests, which greatly increased vegetable production. These experiences are very good and can be imitated and tried in various places. Strengthening vegetable field management, timely watering and fertilization, cultivating and weeding, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, and striving to increase the yield of each stubble are also important ways to increase the total yield. At present, the most prominent problem in vegetable field management is the lack of labor. In addition to taking fixed professional teams and arranging a certain amount of labor to support them, all regions should mobilize the masses to carry out tool reform on a large scale, which is the fundamental way to solve the problem of labor shortage. Xiaozhan Commune in Tianjin mobilized commune members to carry out tool reform on a large scale, and has created and reformed 43 kinds of garden tools, such as ditchers, seeders, soil covering machines, and ridging machines. These tools generally increase work efficiency by several times to dozens of times and solve the problem of labor shortage.

　　Summer is an important season for producing vegetables. It is necessary to make full use of favorable natural conditions to plant as many vegetables and increase the variety as much as possible. All cities and regions that can already self-supply vegetables should strive to increase the variety and plant more fine vegetables and condiments to meet the diverse needs of the people. Vegetable production must be good at seizing opportunities. When the peak season arrives, arrangements should be made for mass production. Vegetable production is seasonal. Under the current conditions, it is still difficult to achieve a complete balance between vegetable production and supply in different seasons. Only by producing more, processing more, and storing more in the peak season can the deficiency of less supply in the off-season be made up. In order to meet the arrival of the peak season for vegetable production, all regions should make preparations for processing and storage as early as possible. In vegetable production, it is necessary to continue to implement the spirit of "looking at the off-season in the peak season, and looking at winter and spring in summer and autumn." Whether in urban or rural areas, it is necessary to process and store a sufficient amount of vegetables in order to better meet the needs of urban and rural people in the off-season.

　　Vegetable production is a major issue related to the lives of the people across the country. This is both an important economic task and an important political task. Party committees at all levels, people's committees, and people's communes in various places must conscientiously implement the spirit of the "Instructions on Current Vegetable Work" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on February 18 this year, and grasp vegetable production season after season. It is necessary to grasp the current summer vegetable production, and also to make arrangements for the whole year's work; it is necessary to grasp vegetable production well, and also to grasp vegetable processing and market supply. The industrial, agricultural, commercial, and transportation departments in various regions should, under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, cooperate closely, support each other, and strive to do a good job in various tasks such as production, transportation, supply, processing, and storage during the peak season for vegetables. With the unified leadership of the Party committee and the close cooperation of various departments, relying on the superiority of the people's communes and the revolutionary drive of the vast number of commune members, it is believed that vegetable production this summer and throughout the year will surely achieve greater harvests.

### 蔬菜生产要季季都抓紧

    蔬菜生产要季季都抓紧
    春菜已经大量上市，夏菜生产旺季就要到来。在这蔬菜生产的大好季节里，适当扩大夏菜种植面积，努力增产更多更好的蔬菜，进一步满足城乡广大人民日益增长的需要，是当前农业生产战线上一个重要任务。
    今年全国蔬菜生产形势极为良好，可以概括为：多、早、好、细四个字。今年第一季度蔬菜供应量比去年同期增加了，而且蔬菜播种面积也普遍扩大了。据北京、天津、上海等三十二个大中城市和工矿区统计，今年蔬菜播种面积规划较1959年扩大30％左右；河南、河北等二十三个省区的蔬菜播种面积规划也较1959年扩大35％左右。各地对今年蔬菜生产都比往年抓得早，一般都做到了播种早、育苗早、移栽定苗早、上市早。许多地区在安排今年的蔬菜生产时不仅扩大了种植数量，而且蔬菜的品种比去年也有了显著的增加。很多党委对蔬菜生产的领导抓得紧、抓得细，既切实安排了全年生产和供应计划，又安排了季度、月份的生产和供应计划；不仅安排了商品菜的生产，也安排了社员的自食菜和蔬菜种子的生产。这些情况充分表明，今年我国蔬菜生产将要比去年有很大增长，蔬菜供应将会得到进一步的改善。
    但是，我们不能因此认为我们的蔬菜生产工作已经作得很充分了。所谓好，是同过去比较而言的。我们应该用发展的观点看问题，几年来，特别是去年以来，我国的蔬菜生产虽然有了很大的增长，今年蔬菜生产战线上的形势虽然很好，但是仍然不能充分满足广大城乡人民生活的改善和工农业生产发展的需要。蔬菜含有的许多营养素是粮食中没有的，不管在什么时候，蔬菜都是人们生活中一项重要的副食品，既可以增加营养，又可以节约粮食，而且，在遭受灾害时，蔬菜还可以补助粮食的不足。去年我国有三分之一耕地遭受不同程度的水旱灾害，虽然我们依靠人民公社的集体力量，战胜了自然灾害，在全国范围内获得了丰收，但仍然有一部分地区粮食减产，在这些地区更要早种多种蔬菜，供应人们食用。特别是经过两年连续大跃进，一方面人民的生活进一步提高，对蔬菜的要求愈来愈多，愈来愈高。一方面随着国家社会主义建设事业的高速度发展，城市人口迅速增加，新的城市和工矿区不断涌现，要求农业部门生产更多更好的蔬菜，供应城市和工矿区居民的需要。这是巩固工农联盟的一项重要措施，是农业支援国家建设的一个光荣任务。其次，蔬菜是一种产量很大、生长很快的作物，大量发展蔬菜生产不仅可以大大改善人们的生活，还可以解决饲料不足的困难，促进畜牧业更快发展。我国的畜牧业特别是养猪事业，去年以来有了飞跃的发展，到1959年底，生猪存栏数已达一亿八千万头，今年养猪头数将比去年增加35％。瓜菜是一种很好的饲料，应该大量种植瓜菜，满足养猪事业大发展的需要。
    多多种植蔬菜，特别是要抓住当前蔬菜生产的旺季，大种夏菜，是当前蔬菜生产中的重要问题。凡是蔬菜生产计划没有全部落实的地区，应迅速具体落实，尽可能将计划落实到田，责任到人。凡是蔬菜种得不足的地区，都应当尽量多种。蔬菜像其他的农作物一样，种植足够的面积是保证大丰收的第一个关键，只有种植面积有了保证，才为蔬菜生产大丰收打下了基础。在安排蔬菜种植面积时，既要保证完成国家的商品菜的种植计划，也要保证广大社员自食菜的种植计划，不能只顾一头。有不少城市郊区很重视商品蔬菜的种植，但对社员自食蔬菜计划安排得不够切实。这些地区应适当扩大社员自食菜的面积。对于蔬菜种子地，也需要规定必要的面积，专门用作采种留种。同时应利用空地尽可能多种一些瓜类等饲料作物。总之，要保证有足够的蔬菜种植面积，决不能因为增种粮食和工业原料作物而挤掉蔬菜。目前一些新兴城市和工矿区蔬菜还不能全部自给，除了其他地区应给予一定的支援外，这些地区必须鼓足干劲，克服困难，尽量扩大蔬菜播种面积，逐步做到蔬菜自给。农村人民公社和有条件的生产队要按照国家计划种好商品菜，同时应该以公共食堂为中心大力发展蔬菜生产，做到全部蔬菜自给自足，保证社员每天都能吃到足够的新鲜蔬菜。这是改善社员生活和办好食堂的一项极其重要的措施。农村社员和机关、工厂、团体、学校，也可以利用自留地、荒地、空地和房前屋后的各种零星土地，大量种植瓜菜，大家动手来解决吃菜问题。
    在扩大蔬菜种植面积的同时，还要努力提高单位面积产量。提高单位产量的有效办法，就是充分利用土地，增加复种、套种面积。在菜田茬口的安排上，应注意利用不同品种，一茬接一茬，尽量提高复种次数。南方的福州、杭州、广州等地的先进单位，有一年复种十次以上的；北方的山西运城县解州公社，去年采取混种、隔畦栽培、育苗移栽等办法，实现了八种七收和六种六收，大大提高了蔬菜产量。这些经验是很好的，各地都可以仿效试行。加强菜田管理，及时浇水、施肥，中耕除草，防治病虫害，努力提高每一茬的产量，也是提高总产量的重要办法。目前菜田管理中最突出的问题是劳动力不足。各地除采取固定专业队和安排一定劳动力加以支援以外，应该发动群众大搞工具改革，这是解决劳力不足的根本出路。天津市小站公社发动社员大搞工具改革，已创制和改制成功的有开沟器、播种器、复土器、作畦机等四十三种园田工具，这些工具一般都提高工效几倍到几十倍，解决了劳动力不足的问题。
    夏季是生产蔬菜的重要季节，要充分利用有利的自然条件，尽可能多种一些蔬菜和多增加一些品种。凡是蔬菜已能自给的城市和地区，要努力增加品种，增种细菜和调味品，满足人民多种多样的需要。生产蔬菜要善于掌握时机。在旺季到来的时候，就要安排大量生产。蔬菜生产是有季节性的，在目前的条件下，还很难作到蔬菜生产和供应在不同的季节里完全平衡。只有在旺季多生产一些，多加工、贮存一些，才能弥补淡季供应量较少的缺陷。为了迎接蔬菜生产旺季的到来，各地要及早做好加工、贮存的各项准备工作。在蔬菜生产中，必须继续贯彻“旺季看淡季，夏秋看冬春”的精神，不论城市或农村，都要加工、贮存足够数量的蔬菜，以便更好地满足城乡人民在淡季的需要。
    蔬菜生产是关系全国人民生活的大事情，这既是重要的经济任务，也是重要的政治任务。各级党委、人民委员会、各地人民公社，必须认真贯彻今年2月18日中共中央、国务院“关于当前蔬菜工作的指示”的精神，对蔬菜生产要一季接一季，季季都抓紧。既要抓当前夏菜生产，也要做好全年工作安排；既抓好蔬菜生产，也抓好蔬菜加工和市场供应。各地的工业、农业、商业和交通运输部门，应该在当地党委的统一领导下，密切协作，互相支援，努力做好蔬菜旺季的生产、运输、供应、加工、贮存等各项工作。有了党委的统一领导和各部门的密切协作，依靠人民公社的优越性和广大社员的革命干劲，可以相信，今年夏季和全年的蔬菜生产一定能够获得更大丰收。
