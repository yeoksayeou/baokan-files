　　The Rabbit Dies, the Fox Grieves
　　Syngman Rhee, the number one puppet of the United States in South Korea and the number one traitor whom the South Korean people hate to the bone, has been overthrown and spurned by the South Korean people and has become a political corpse. But Eisenhower honored him as the "father of the nation" and a "great patriot" of South Korea. On May 5, he wrote to Syngman Rhee, erecting a "monument to a lifetime of work" for him, and even said that Syngman Rhee had "won" the "gratitude of all Koreans." On May 11, he stated at a press conference that he had "admired and respected" Syngman Rhee for "many years."
　　Eisenhower had repeatedly said that the United States did not support dictators. But now, the Syngman Rhee dictatorship, fostered by the United States, has become a half-dead rat in the streets of Seoul, discrediting the United States. Yet, Eisenhower still wants to intervene and impose him on the angry South Korean people as the so-called "father of the nation." He also disregards the South Korean people's continued struggle against Heo Jeong, wanting this second Syngman Rhee, who is equally notorious, to inherit Syngman Rhee's "benevolence." To what a shameful extent has the US imperialist policy of supporting dictatorial puppets everywhere reached?
　　Why does Eisenhower still stubbornly support Syngman Rhee today? The secret lies in supporting a second Syngman Rhee. Although the United States' puppet manufacturing factory has created Heo Jeong's "new government," announced the resumption of "aid" to South Korea, and stated that it will exercise its responsibility to "defend" South Korea, the United States' dollars, bayonets, plus Heo Jeong's "new government," are still aimed at salvaging the traitorous rule that Syngman Rhee has implemented for twelve years. Heo Jeong's "flagpole of a local temple" is still Syngman Rhee's "monkey tail." Therefore, if we do not confer honors and erect a memorial arch for Syngman Rhee, how can we whitewash the image of the second Syngman Rhee, and how can we paint the US policy of supporting Heo Jeong with new colors, in order to deceive people and avoid the South Korean people's pointing the finger at the United States and Heo Jeong?
　　Not only that, but Eisenhower's appeasement of Syngman Rhee is also an appeasement to the likes of Chiang Kai-shek, Nobusuke Kishi, Ngo Dinh Diem, and Menderes, who are also surrounded by enemies on all sides. Chiang Kai-shek's "Central Daily News" recently lamented that "the tragedy in Korea is a replay of the tragedy we experienced in mainland China ten years ago," demanding that the United States be "more concerned" about the situation in South Korea. Now, isn't Eisenhower's "concern" for Syngman Rhee precisely in line with the aspirations of Chiang Kai-shek's small court? But was there little "concern" from the United States for Syngman Rhee in the past? Was there little "concern" from the United States for Chiang Kai-shek before he was driven out of mainland China? Was there little "concern" from the United States for Batista and Said? However, the "tragedies" of these "fathers of the nation" and "national heroes" are collapsing one after another. Now, how long can those puppets who are still eking out a precarious existence under the support of American bayonets last?
　　US imperialism, represented by Eisenhower, is the protector of all the most reactionary, decadent, and dark forces in the world. "The rabbit dies, the fox grieves; things of one kind feel sorrow for each other." Eisenhower's summoning the soul of Syngman Rhee, does it not make people hear his voice and see the sorrow in his heart?

    兔死狐悲
    李承晚，这个美国在南朝鲜的第一号傀儡、南朝鲜人民恨之入骨的头号卖国贼，已被南朝鲜人民所推翻、所唾弃，成了一具政治僵尸。但是艾森豪威尔却封他为南朝鲜的“国父”、“伟大的爱国者”。5月5日，他写信给李承晚，替李承晚立“毕生工作的丰碑”，还说什么李承晚“博得”了“全体朝鲜人的感激”。5月11日，他在记者招待会上又表示他“多年来一直钦佩和尊敬”李承晚。
    艾森豪威尔曾口口声声说美国没有支持独裁者。但现在美国一手豢养的李承晚独裁者已成了汉城街上的半死老鼠，使美国的名声扫地，艾森豪威尔却还要插上一手，把它作为所谓“国父”强加在愤怒的南朝鲜人民身上。他还不顾南朝鲜人民继续反对许政的斗争，要这个同样声名狼借的第二个李承晚继承李承晚的“恩泽”。美帝国主义到处扶植独裁傀儡的政策，已到了何等可耻的地步。
    为什么艾森豪威尔直到今天仍然要硬着头皮替李承晚捧场呢？此中奥妙在于为了支持李承晚第二。目前美国的傀儡制造工厂虽然制造出了许政的“新政”，宣布了恢复对南朝鲜的“援助”，并表示要对南朝鲜行使“防御”的责任。可是，美国的美元、刺刀加许政的“新政”，仍然是为了挽救李承晚十二年来所实行的卖国统治；许政的“土地庙的旗杆”仍然是李承晚的“猴尾巴”，所以，如果不为李承晚封功勋，立牌坊，又怎能为第二个李承晚粉饰门面，又怎能为美国支持许政的政策涂上新的色采，借以迷惑人心，从而躲避南朝鲜人民指向美国和许政的锋芒？
    不仅这样，艾森豪威尔之安抚李承晚，也是对同样处于四面楚歌的蒋介石、岸信介、吴庭艳、曼德列斯之流的安抚。蒋介石的“中央日报”，最近就哀鸣“朝鲜的悲剧正是十年前我们在大陆中国所发生的悲剧的重演”，要求美国对南朝鲜局势必须“更为关心”。现在，艾森豪威尔对李承晚的“关心”，岂不是正符合蒋介石小朝廷的渴望么。但是，美国过去对李承晚的“关心”还少吗？美国对蒋介石被赶出中国大陆前的“关心”还少吗？美国对巴蒂斯塔、赛义德的“关心”还少吗？可是，这群“国父”、“民族英雄”们的“悲剧”，却是一个接着一个地倒下去。现在，那些还在美国刺刀支撑下的苟延残喘的傀儡们，又能支撑多久呢？
    以艾森豪威尔为代表的美帝国主义是世界上一切最反动最腐朽最黑暗的势力的庇护者。“兔死狐悲，物伤其类”。艾森豪威尔为李承晚招魂，岂不使人闻其声而见其心之哀也。
