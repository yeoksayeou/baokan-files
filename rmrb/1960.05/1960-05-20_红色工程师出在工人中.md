    Red Engineers Emerge from the Workers
    The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee recently selected over a hundred outstanding workers to serve as engineers. One of them is Jin Xingtao, a worker from the Shanghai Automobile Electric Motor Factory who came from a shepherd background. This good news spread throughout the factory, invigorating and inspiring everyone. Jin Xingtao couldn't suppress his feelings of gratitude and wrote a poem: The factory director came to me with good news, saying I've become an engineer. My heart jumped upon hearing this, and I didn't know how to express my feelings. Although there have been minor achievements in recent years, they all rely on the Party's cultivation. The Party's kindness is deeper than the sea, and the Party's teachings are better than a mother. The future ahead is long and vast, and I must always practice diligently. I will never disappoint the Party's teachings, and I will never fail the Party's cultivation. I will temper my fiery red heart in the furnace, hold high the red flag and leap forward again, be humble, humble, and even more humble, rely on the Party and the masses to climb the peaks.
  The workers were even more elated, and many also wrote poems to praise it. Worker Zhou Baocheng wrote these three poems: Pearls emerge from the sea, phoenixes emerge from the mountains, red engineers, emerge from the workers. Infants grow up relying on their mothers, seedlings grow relying on the sun, workers become engineers, relying on the Party's cultivation to grow. Spring fills the garden with a hundred flowers blooming, every red flower is planted by the Party, workers become engineers, and red flowers bloom with brilliance, each one more beautiful than the last, red flowers facing the sun like a sea of clouds. Worker Gao Meisheng wrote: Workers become engineers, a thousand-year miracle now exists, science returns to its home, scaling the peaks of high, large, sophisticated, and cutting-edge technology.

    红色工程师出在工人中
    上海市人民委员会最近选拔了一百多位优秀工人担任工程师。其中有一位是牧童出身的上海汽车电机厂工人金兴涛。这喜讯传到厂里，人人振奋，个个鼓舞。金兴涛抑制不住感动的心情，写了一首诗：厂长找我报喜讯，说我当了工程师，听罢心脏跳不停，不知怎样表心情，几年虽有微成绩，都是依靠党培养，党的恩情深似海，党的教导胜母亲。今后前程万里长，我要永远勤苦练，决不辜负党教导，决不辜负党培养，烈火红心熔炉炼，高举红旗再跃进，虚心虚心再虚心，靠党靠群攀高峰。
  工人们更是兴高彩烈，不少人也写了诗来歌颂。工人周宝承写了这样三首：珍珠出海中，凤凰出山中，红色工程师，出在工人中。婴儿成长靠娘养，禾苗生长靠太阳，工人当了工程师，靠党培养得成长。春色满园百花开，朵朵红花是党栽，工人当了工程师，红花开放现异彩，一朵要比一朵美，红花朝阳如云海。工人高梅生写的是：工人当了工程师，千年奇迹如今有，科学从此回老家，高大精尖攀高峰。
