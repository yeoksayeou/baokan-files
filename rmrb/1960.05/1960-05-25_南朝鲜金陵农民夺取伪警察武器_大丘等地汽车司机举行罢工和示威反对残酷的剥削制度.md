　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 24th: Seoul dispatch: On May 23rd, more than 1,500 farmers in Buhang Township, Geumneung County, North Gyeongsang Province, fought with puppet police in order to drive away the puppet township office (i.e., district government). In the fight, the farmers seized weapons such as machine guns and carbines from the puppet police.

　　According to South Korea's Hapdong News Agency, more than 500 farmers in Sadeung-ri, Buhang Township, fought with more than 30 puppet police brought by the "chief" of the Gimcheon Puppet Police Station on May 23rd in order to drive out the puppet township office, which had been forcibly moved to Sadeung-ri on the 15th. As a result, six puppet police were injured, and one American-made light machine gun and three carbines were seized. The farmers in Yucheon-dong, the original location of this puppet township office, also resolutely opposed the return of the puppet township office, which oppresses and exploits the people, to Yucheon-dong. On May 23rd, more than 1,000 farmers in this village attacked the Buhan Branch of the puppet police stationed there, seizing two carbines and one American-made gun.

　　It is reported that the puppet "Governor" of North Gyeongsang Province, the "Director" of the puppet police bureau, and the "Regimental Commander" of the 122nd Regiment of the 50th Division of the puppet army, frightened by the people's resistance, rushed to Buhan Township this morning to lure and suppress the farmers.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 24th: Seoul dispatch: Car drivers in Daegu, Seoul, and other places in South Korea are making persistent efforts, supporting each other, and continuing to wage a tenacious struggle to improve working conditions and oppose the cruel system of exploitation.

　　According to Daegu Radio, more than 200 taxi drivers in Daegu held a demonstration by driving their cars on the 23rd. According to the drivers' exposure on the streets, the so-called "North Gyeongsang Province Taxi Owners Association," protected by the puppet authorities, is an intermediate exploitation agency created by speculators who do not even own a single car. The drivers demanded an investigation and punishment of these people. They also demanded the abolition of the so-called "Traffic Safety Association" as an intermediate exploitation agency. It is reported that South Korean car drivers are not only exploited by the puppet authorities, car owners, and various intermediate exploitation agencies, but are also frequently extorted by puppet military police.

　　It is also reported that the bus drivers on the Seoul-Sinchon line, who launched their struggle on the afternoon of the 22nd to strive for improved working conditions and the implementation of the eight-hour work system, are still fighting tenaciously. They refuse to work every day after 2 p.m.

　　According to Seoul Christian Radio today, more than 2,000 car drivers on 550 buses in Seoul support the struggle of the bus drivers on the Seoul-Sinchon line and said that they will also launch such a struggle.

    新华社平壤24日电　汉城消息：庆尚北道金陵郡釜项面一千五百多农民23日为了赶走伪面事务所（即区政府），同伪警察展开了搏斗。在搏斗中，农民们夺取了伪警察的机关枪和卡宾枪等武器。
    据南朝鲜合同通讯社报道，釜项面沙等里的五百多名农民23日为了把15日强行移到沙等里的伪面事务所驱逐出去，同金泉伪警察署“署长”带来的三十多名伪警察展开了搏斗，结果打伤六名伪警察，夺取了一挺美式轻机关枪和三支卡宾枪。这个伪面事务所原来的所在地柳村洞的农民也坚决不要压迫和剥削人民的伪面事务所再迁回柳村洞。23日这个村的一千多名农民袭击了驻在那里的伪警察釜项支署，夺取了两支卡宾枪和一支美式枪。
    据报道，被人民的反抗吓慌了的伪庆尚北道“道知事”、伪警察局“局长”和伪军五十师团一二二联队的“联队长”今天上午都赶到釜项面，向农民进行诱骗和镇压。
    新华社平壤24日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜大丘、汉城等地的汽车司机，正再接再厉，相互支持，继续为改善劳动条件、反对残酷的剥削制度展开顽强的斗争。
    据大丘广播电台广播，大丘市内二百多辆出租汽车的司机，23日开着汽车举行示威。据司机在街头上揭露，在傀儡当局庇护下的所谓“庆（尚）北（道）出租汽车车主协会”是连一辆汽车也没有的投机分子制造出来的中间剥削机关。司机们要求调查和惩办这些人。他们还要求废除所谓“交通安全协会”的中间剥削机关。据报道，南朝鲜的汽车司机不仅受着傀儡当局、车主和中间一些五花八门的剥削机关的剥削，还经常遭受伪军警的勒索。
    另据报道，从22日下午展开斗争的汉城—新村线路上的公共汽车司机为了争取改善劳动条件和实现八小时劳动制，一直到现在还在顽强地进行斗争。他们每到下午两点就拒绝做工。
