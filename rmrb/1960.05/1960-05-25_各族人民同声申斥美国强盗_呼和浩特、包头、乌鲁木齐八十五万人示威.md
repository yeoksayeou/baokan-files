Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 24th: Over 600,000 people of all ethnic groups from all walks of life in Hohhot and Baotou cities, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, held rallies and demonstrations on the 23rd, firmly supporting the Soviet Union's just stand against American imperialism's aggression and severely condemning American imperialism's crimes of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

In Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, 400,000 people of all ethnic groups from the city to the suburbs held rallies in dozens of locations on the 23rd. Ulanhu, First Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Autonomous Region, spoke at the rally in the central venue. He said: The ten million people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region resolutely oppose American imperialism's aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union and resolutely oppose American imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference. American imperialism's aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union is aggression and provocation against China and against the entire socialist camp. The people of Inner Mongolia fully support the relevant statements and speeches of our party and state leaders, and fully support the Soviet Union's solemn stand against American imperialism's aggression, together with the people of the whole country. In his speech, Ulanhu exposed American imperialism's conspiracy of feigning peace while actively expanding its armaments and preparing for war. He stated that the people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely stand with the Soviet people and fight to the end to defend world peace.

Sun Lanfeng, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, and representatives of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and various people's organizations of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously condemned the crimes of American imperialism in sending military aircraft to invade the Soviet Union and sabotage the Four-Power Summit Conference.

At the rallies held in dozens of locations in Hohhot on the 23rd, workers, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, students, government cadres, and citizens of all ethnic groups angrily shouted slogans such as "Support the Soviet government's solemn stand against American imperialism's aggression!" and "People of the world unite, down with American imperialism!" Sangga Xili, a Mongolian soldier who volunteered to participate in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and was awarded the Third-Class National Flag Medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, revealed to the new soldiers participating in the meeting the ugly image of American imperialism's disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield. He said: If American imperialism dares to continue launching aggression against the Soviet Union and the entire socialist countries, it will surely suffer an extremely tragic defeat. In Baotou City, the city of iron and steel industry, more than 200,000 people of all ethnic groups also held rallies and demonstrations on the 23rd to support the Soviet Union's just stand against American imperialism's aggression.

Su Qianyi, Yang Zhilin, Kui Bi, Wang Duo, and Wang Zaitian, Secretaries of the Secretariat of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as Soviet and Mongolian experts in Inner Mongolia, also participated in the mass rallies in Hohhot and Baotou.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 23rd: Two hundred and fifty thousand people of all ethnic groups in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, held an unprecedented rally and demonstration today in the pouring rain, supporting the Soviet Union's solemn stand against American imperialism's aggression and condemning American imperialism's crimes of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

Enraged by American imperialism's aggression against our great ally, the Soviet Union, the people of all ethnic groups in Urumqi turned out in full force today. 100,000 workers, peasants, government cadres, students, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and members of urban people's communes took to the streets from 11:00 a.m., forming hundreds of streams of people, gathering in the rain at the People's Square in the city center to hold a rally. They held up placards written in various ethnic languages and shouted slogans along the way. At the same time, 150,000 people from all factories, government agencies, schools, and people's communes in the suburbs of the city also held rallies.

The mass rally, attended by 100,000 people, was held at the People's Square at 1:30 p.m. in the rain. Zeng Di and Li Quan, Secretaries of the Secretariat of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, alternate secretaries Qi Guo and Lin Bomin, Vice Chairmen of the Autonomous Region Xin Lanting and Yimin Nuofu, Deputy Political Commissar of the Xinjiang Military Region Zuo Qi, Vice Chairmen of the Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference Yu Zhanlin and Yiming Mahsumu, Ren Gebai, First Secretary of the Urumqi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Secretary Sun Zhe, and Urumqi Mayor Yasheng Hudaibair attended today's meeting. Also attending the meeting were Koshenin and Tsimlyansky, Deputy Consul Generals of the Soviet Union in Urumqi, staff of the Consulate General, staff of the Urumqi branch of the Soviet Trade Representative Office in China, and Soviet experts.

Zeng Di, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He cited facts to prove that American imperialism's aggressive nature cannot be changed. He pointed out: American imperialism is the number one enemy of world peace. All peace-loving forces can only defend peace by waging a resolute struggle against imperialism, especially American imperialism. He quoted an ancient saying, "He who commits many injustices will destroy himself." American imperialism is engaging in aggression and plunder all over the world, and as a result, it is putting many nooses around its own neck. Its life is not long. At this time, shouts of "Down with American imperialism!" overwhelmed the entire venue.

The masses warmly welcomed the speech by Koshenin, Deputy Consul General of the Soviet Union in Urumqi. He said that American imperialism's shameless and reckless move to violate Soviet airspace has received its due punishment, and anyone who dares to violate Soviet borders with aggressive intentions in the future will receive the same fate. While Koshenin was speaking, the masses continuously shouted: "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!"

Following him, Yiming Mahsumu, Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Director of the Islamic Association of the Autonomous Region, spoke at the meeting. He represented people from all walks of life and all Muslims in Xinjiang in expressing great indignation at American imperialism's banditry and expressed firm support for the Soviet government's solemn stand against American imperialism's aggression. Gao Shuxian, a representative of various people's organizations in the Autonomous Region, also spoke. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the Soviet government's just stand.

    在内蒙古自治区首府呼和浩特市，23日从城市到郊区，有四十万各族人民分成几十处举行了集会。中共内蒙古自治区委员会第一书记、自治区主席乌兰夫在中心会场的集会上讲了话。他说：内蒙古自治区的一千万各族各界人民坚决反对美帝国主义对苏联的侵略和挑衅，坚决反对美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议。美帝国主义对苏联的侵略和挑衅，就是对我们中国的侵略和挑衅，也是对整个社会主义阵营的侵略和挑衅。内蒙古全区人民和全国人民一起，完全拥护我们党和国家领导人的有关声明和讲话，完全拥护苏联的反对美帝国主义侵略的严正立场。乌兰夫在讲话中揭露了美帝国主义一面伪装和平一面积极扩军备战的阴谋，他表示，内蒙古自治区的全区人民和全国人民一道，坚决和苏联人民站在一起，为保卫世界和平而斗争到底。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会内蒙古自治区分会副主席孙兰峰，政协内蒙古自治区委员会和内蒙古自治区各人民团体的代表也在会上讲了话，他们一致谴责美帝国主义派遣军用飞机侵略苏联和破坏四国首脑会议的罪行。
    23日在呼和浩特市几十个地方举行的集会上，各族的工人、解放军官兵、学生、机关干部和市民们愤怒地高呼“拥护苏联政府对美帝国主义侵略罪行的严正立场！”、“全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！”等口号。曾经志愿参加抗美援朝战争并且获得朝鲜民主主义人民共和国三级国旗勋章的蒙古族战士桑嘎希力，向参加大会的新战士揭露了美帝国主义在朝鲜战场上的惨败丑相。他说：美帝国主义如果胆敢继续向苏联和整个社会主义国家发动侵略，一定会遭到极其悲惨的失败。在钢铁工业城市——包头市，23日也有二十多万各族人民举行了集会和示威，支持苏联反对美帝国主义侵略的正义立场。

    据新华社乌鲁木齐23日电　新疆维吾尔自治区首府乌鲁木齐市各族人民二十五万人，今天冒着大雨举行空前规模的集会和示威，支持苏联反对美帝国主义侵略的严正立场，谴责美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议的罪行。
    被美帝国主义对我国的伟大盟邦苏联进行侵略所激怒的乌鲁木齐市各族人民，今天倾城而出，十万名工人、农民、机关干部、学生、人民解放军战士和城市人民公社社员，从中午十一时起就拥上街头，汇成几百条人流，在大雨中聚集在市中心人民广场上举行了集会。他们高举各种民族文字书写的标语牌，一路上高呼口号。与此同时，全市郊区所有的工厂、机关、学校和人民公社的十五万名群众，也纷纷举行集会。

    群众热烈欢迎苏联驻乌鲁木齐市副总领事柯申宁的讲话。他说，美帝国主义侵犯苏联领空的无耻的轻举妄动得到了应有的惩罚，今后谁敢抱着侵略目的侵犯苏联国境，也会得到同样的下场。在柯申宁讲话的时候，群众不断高呼：“中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！”
