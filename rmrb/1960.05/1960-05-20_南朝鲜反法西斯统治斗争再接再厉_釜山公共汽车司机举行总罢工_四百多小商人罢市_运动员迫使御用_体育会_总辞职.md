Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 19th: Busan dispatch: Amidst workers' strikes and student demonstrations in South Korea, bus drivers, merchants, and athletes in Busan have also joined the struggle against fascist rule and for improved treatment.

According to Tonghwa News Agency, all bus drivers in Busan City began a general strike at 4:00 PM on the 18th. They stated that they were subjected to eighteen hours of slave labor every day, without Sundays or holidays, and only received wages equivalent to one-third of the minimum living expenses. They put forward demands to the employers for higher wages and guaranteed rest time, and declared that the strike would continue until the employers agreed to these conditions. As of today, transportation in Busan is still in a state of "paralysis."

It is reported that more than 100 athletes in Busan successfully ousted the Syngman Rhee stooges from the Busan "Sports Association" on the 18th.

On this day, as the Syngman Rhee stooges in the Busan "Sports Association" were holding the so-called second "Joint Meeting of Directors," more than 100 athletes rushed into the venue, shouting: "Get out, you puppet cadres, directors, and executive members!" Under the pressure of the masses, the "Chairman," "Vice-Chairman," and all "Directors" of the "Sports Association" who were in the meeting had to announce their collective resignation. After ousting the stooges, the athletes decided to convene a temporary meeting to elect new cadres.

The news said that the Syngman Rhee stooges of the Busan "Sports Association," under the "Korean Sports Association" with Syngman Rhee as "President," used the "Sports Association" as a tool for making money, preventing the good development of sports, and athletes had long been dissatisfied with them.

According to the Busan Cultural Broadcasting Station, more than 400 small merchants selling cloth in the Busan International Market went on strike on the 18th. They flocked to the puppet tax authorities to condemn the cruel exploitation of the puppet tax authorities in collecting a wide variety of exorbitant taxes. They put forward ten demands, including "Immediately purge illegal tax officials" and "Fairly and reasonably share taxes," and launched a strike struggle to implement these demands. This is the first time that merchants have collectively gone on strike in the South Korean people's struggle for more than two months.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 19th: Seoul dispatch: The South Korean people continue to wage a struggle against paying taxes.

According to Busan Radio Station, the puppet tax authorities in Gyeongsangnam-do only collected 400 million won in "local taxes" in April, which is 33% less than the average monthly collection in the past.

It is reported that the anti-tax struggle launched by the people of Masan, where the large-scale demonstration struggle against the US-Rhee clique first ignited, is the most intense, and the puppet tax authorities there are "almost paralyzed."

Busan Radio Station admitted that it would be "quite difficult to enable the puppet tax authorities in Gyeongsangnam-do to 'function normally.'"

    南朝鲜反法西斯统治斗争再接再厉
    釜山公共汽车司机举行总罢工
    四百多小商人罢市　运动员迫使御用“体育会”总辞职
    新华社平壤19日电　釜山消息：在南朝鲜工人罢工、学生示威声中，釜山市的公共汽车司机、商人和运动员也投入了反对法西斯统治和要求改善待遇的斗争。
    据同和通讯社报道，釜山市内的所有的公共汽车司机从18日下午四时开始举行了总罢工。他们说，他们每天进行十八小时的奴隶劳动，没有星期日也没有假期，而只能拿到等于维持最低生活费用的三分之一的工资。他们向资方提出了提高工资、保障休息时间的条件，并且宣称一直罢工到资方答应这些条件时为止。一直到今天，釜山市内交通还处于“麻痹状态”。
    据报道，釜山市一百多名运动员18日胜利地把釜山“体育会”中的李承晚走狗赶下了台。
    这一天釜山“体育会”的李承晚的走狗们正在举行所谓第二次“理事联席会议”时，一百多名运动员冲进了会场，高呼：“御用干部、理事和常务人员滚出去！”，正在开会的“体育会”的“会长”、“副会长”和全体“理事”在群众的压力下不得不宣布全体总辞职。运动员们把走狗们赶下台后，决定召开临时会议选出新的干部。
    消息说，以李承晚为“总裁”的“大韩体育会”属下的釜山市“体育会”的李承晚走狗们把“体育会”当作赚钱的工具，使体育事业不能很好的发展，运动员很久以来就对他们不满。
    据釜山文化广播电台报道，釜山市国际市场四百多名贩卖布匹的小商人18日举行了罢市。他们一起涌到伪税务机关，谴责伪税务当局征收名目繁多的苛捐杂税的残酷的剥削行为。他们提出了“立即肃清不法的税务官吏”、“公平合理地负担捐税”等十项要求，并为贯彻这些要求展开了罢市斗争。在南朝鲜人民两个多月来的斗争中，商人集体罢市这是第一次。
    新华社平壤19日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜人民继续展开抗缴捐税的斗争。
    据釜山广播电台广播，庆尚南道的伪税务当局在4月份征收到手的“地方税”只有四亿圜，比过去每月平均征收的数量少了33％。
    据报道，首先燃起反对美李集团大规模示威斗争烽火的马山市人民展开的抗税斗争最为激烈，那里的伪税务机关“几乎陷入麻痹状态”。
    釜山广播电台承认，要使庆尚南道伪税务机关“发挥正常机能，会有相当困难。”
