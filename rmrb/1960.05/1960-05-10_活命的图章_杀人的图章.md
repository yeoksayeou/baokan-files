    The Stamp of Life, the Stamp of Murder
    (Japan) Songtian Jiezi
    
    Kishi Nobusuke in Washington
    With a "smack," a large seal was stamped. That was
    the seal for the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. military alliance -- the new
    "Security Treaty." Its other name is
    the slaughter of the entire nation,
    a stamp
    that sets fires in Asia and the whole world. But,
    the stamps we use are stamps of life. The murderous Kishi-marked seal may be made of ivory;
    the ones we use cost at most fifty yuan,
    but know that this seal contains
    our thoughts,
    our grievances,
    our hatred,
    our wisdom. We dip the stamp
    fully into the inkpad dyed red with our blood,
    and stamp it solemnly and deliberately,
    and write our address.
    We write our name. The place where we live is the "palace" where we, who have been squeezed dry, live, the nest of life designated as "healthy
    and cultural" by the Peaceful Constitution. Good! We will never hang ourselves or commit family suicide in this "palace" and "nest"; we will no longer allow these guys and their masters to trample on our Japanese archipelago. "The government wants to start a war again,
    seize my son,
    anyway, he will always be bombed by the atomic bomb,
    I would rather kill him myself first,
    than hand him over,
    how could I hand him over!"
    A mother muttered, using her calloused hands, to stamp the seal to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty".
    These stamps, one after another,
    and the sound made when stamping, the sound of the paper and pen rubbing when writing the address and name,
    millions of them gathered together, is a thunderbolt! This is the people's thunder. We eagerly hope to turn this thunder into strength, into material
    strength that can be seen with the eyes. My life has been enriched because I am focusing all my attention on this wish. I walk forward, today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow, I keep walking forward. We are stamping the stamp of life, we are stamping the stamp of life.

    活命的图章　杀人的图章
    （日本）　松田解子岸信介在华盛顿
  叭的一声盖了一个大图章。那是
  签订日美军事同盟——新
    “安全条约”的图章。它的别名叫作
  屠杀全国人民，
  在亚洲和全世界放火的图
    章。但是，
  我们盖的却是活命的图章。杀人的岸记图章也许是象牙的
  哩；我们用的却是至多只值五十元
  的便宜货，要知道，这图章里却蕴含着
  我们的心思，
  我们的怨恨，
  我们的憎恶，
  我们的睿智。我们把图章
  醮饱用我们鲜血染红的印
    色，郑重而沉着地盖上它，
  还写上我们的住址。
  写上我们的名字。我们居住的地方就是被压榨一空的我们起居的“宫殿”，是和平宪法指定为“健康
  而又文化”的生活巢穴。好！我们决不在这“宫殿”和“巢
  穴”里上吊，或者全家自杀；我们再不准许这些家伙和他们
  的主子践踏我们的日本列岛。“政府要再一次发动战争，
  抓走我的儿子，
  反正总是要被原子弹炸死，
  我宁肯自己先来杀死他，
  也不把他交出去，
  ——我怎么肯把他交出去
    呀！”一位母亲絮语着，用生满老茧的手，盖了阻止批准新“安全条约”
  的图章。这一个个挨着盖下去的图章，
  和盖章时发出的声音，这写住址和姓名时，
  发出的纸笔相擦的声音，千百万个汇集在一起，就是一声霹雳！这是人民的巨雷。我们热望把这巨响变成力量，变成用眼睛能够瞧见的物质力
  量。我的生命得到了充实，因为我全神贯注着这个愿望。我向前走去，今天，明天和后天，我不停地向前走去。我们盖的是活命的图章，我们盖的是活命的图章。
