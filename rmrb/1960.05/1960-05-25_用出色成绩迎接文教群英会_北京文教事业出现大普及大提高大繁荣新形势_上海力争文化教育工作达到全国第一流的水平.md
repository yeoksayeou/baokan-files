Xinhua News Agency, May 24th – Recently, the education, culture, health, sports, and news systems in the capital held representative conferences of advanced units and advanced workers, respectively. They summarized the achievements and experiences since the Beijing Cultural and Educational Advanced Workers Representative Conference, proposed new tasks, and selected 180 representatives to attend the National Cultural and Educational Advanced Workers Representative Conference.

The Beijing Cultural and Educational Advanced Workers Representative Conference, held in February this year, propelled the advanced worker movement in the city's cultural and educational circles to a new climax, and a new situation of continued universalization, improvement, and prosperity emerged in various cultural and educational undertakings. Cultural and educational workers are all dedicating their leap-forward achievements to the National Cultural and Educational Advanced Workers Representative Conference.

In the past few months, more than 20,000 teachers and students from various universities and secondary vocational schools have gone down to factories and the countryside to participate in productive labor, devote themselves to the technological revolution, learn from workers and peasants, and have made great achievements in ideological revolution, technological revolution, teaching, and scientific research. In the past month or so alone, Tsinghua University has collaborated with various factories and mines in Beijing to complete 179 major technological innovations, 60% of which have been put into production; by the end of April, teachers and students had already completed or started scientific research tasks originally scheduled for the end of the year or even a three-year plan ahead of schedule. Teachers and students of the Beijing Mining College formed a support-agriculture team with workers to help rural people's communes build agricultural machinery repair and assembly plants, manufacturing more than 40 kinds of innovative machines such as earthen gantry planers, levelers, and seeders. Teachers and students of the Mathematics Department of Beijing Normal University broke through the old system of mathematics teaching and compiled 820,000 words of trial textbooks in a short period. Many primary and secondary schools are actively conducting various experimental reforms of the school system to improve teaching quality, and advanced teaching experiences centered on improving teaching quality are also blossoming everywhere. Forty-two factories and mines in the city have established a spare-time education system from primary school to university.

The achievements of cultural, health, sports, and news workers in the past few months have also been remarkable. Professional arts units have successively linked up with factories, construction sites, and people's communes as fixed bases for arts workers to delve into life, engage in labor training, and guide mass spare-time cultural activities; at the same time, mass creation activities were carried out, and a colorful arts performance was held in May. The mass sports exercise movement reached a climax, and the city successively held 20,000 basketball games, a 500,000-person shooting exercise, a 100,000-person table tennis tournament, and a 100,000-person camping trip. Health and medical units sent people to the countryside, factories, and streets to carry out health care and prevention work. In the past two months, they have screened 3.4 million people for hypertension, trachoma, rheumatism, dental caries, etc., and helped grassroots units train 180,000 health activists. All hospitals have launched a mass movement to improve the quality of medical care centered on scientific research and technological revolution, and automatic medical operation devices and precision medical equipment have emerged.

In the universalization, improvement, and prosperity of cultural and educational undertakings, the ranks of intellectuals of the working class are growing rapidly. The 180 representatives elected by the capital's cultural and educational circles to attend the National Cultural and Educational Advanced Workers Representative Conference are vanguards standing at the forefront of ideological revolution, cultural revolution, and technological revolution. Among them are famous old professors, doctors, sports workers, and artists, as well as teachers, educators, health workers, film projectionists, etc. who have made extraordinary achievements in ordinary work. There are also many representatives who, not long ago, were illiterate, but now have broken into the "forbidden palace" of culture and science, and are bravely climbing the peaks of science and culture. Wei Conghua, a demobilized soldier and laboratory technician in the Physics Department of Peking University, was originally unfamiliar with "addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division." Under the cultivation of the Party, and after more than a year of unremitting efforts, he has now improved to the point where he can master the technology of complex spectral analysis experiments. Ma Qingfeng, a porter, was a semi-literate a few years ago, but is now a well-known spare-time senior primary school teacher in the city.

The National Cultural and Educational Advanced Workers Representative Conference is about to open. The representatives from Beijing have expressed that they must participate in the conference with the attitude of primary school students, humbly learn from the heroes from all over the country, better play the role of bridge, model, and leader, and work with cultural and educational workers throughout the city to seize new victories.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 24th – Shanghai recently convened a representative conference of advanced units and advanced workers in socialist construction in education, culture, health, sports, and news. All the representatives attending the conference unanimously stated that they would respond to the call of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, cultivate talents for socialist construction in a faster, better, and more economical way, strive to make Shanghai's cultural and educational undertakings and cultural and educational work have a first-class level, and strive to climb the peaks of science and culture.

A total of 7,000 representatives attended the conference, all of whom were outstanding figures in various aspects of Shanghai's cultural and educational front. During the conference, Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Shanghai, delivered a political report. Shi Ximin, alternate secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, made a report on cultural and educational work. Cao Diqiu, secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, congratulated and awarded prizes to the 704 advanced units and 937 advanced workers selected by the conference on behalf of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee at the closing of the conference.

In the past ten years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, Shanghai's cultural and educational work has made great achievements and gained experience. With the vigorous development of the great technological innovation and technological revolution movement on the industrial and agricultural fronts, a new situation of great development, great universalization, great improvement, and great prosperity has also emerged on Shanghai's cultural and educational front. At the meeting, Shi Ximin analyzed the basic experience of the city's cultural and educational work in achieving great achievements and said: The victory of Shanghai's cultural and educational work in the past ten years is primarily due to the adherence to the principle that all cultural and educational undertakings must be under the leadership of the Party, implement the principles of serving proletarian politics, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, combining education with productive labor, and developing cultural and educational undertakings with "walking on two legs," and adhere to the fundamental principle of combining theory with practice, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses. Secondly, it is due to the victory of the Party's policy on intellectuals. While the Party's cultural and educational policies have been successfully implemented, the face of Shanghai's cultural and educational workers has also changed greatly. In the struggle between the two roads and the two ideologies, a red and expert working-class intellectual team is rapidly growing. The vast majority of intellectuals have made progress to varying degrees, and a large number of new generations of intellectuals are constantly emerging. Since the Great Leap Forward, 3,700 people in Shanghai's education, culture, health, sports, and news have gloriously joined the ranks of the Party. More and more people in the cultural and educational ranks have realized that it is necessary to combine intellectuals with workers and peasants, make up their minds to integrate with the working people, and place themselves among the masses, so that they can move forward with light equipment. Third, to develop cultural and educational undertakings in a faster, better, and more economical way, it is necessary to resolutely rely on the masses, implement the Party's mass line, and carry out mass movements in a big way; at the same time, it is also necessary to break superstitions and liberate the mind. The victory of Shanghai's cultural and educational undertakings is precisely the victory of breaking superstitions, liberating the mind, continuous revolution, and carrying out mass movements in a big way.

Shi Ximin encouraged advanced workers to always maintain their advanced status, be promoters on the cultural and educational front, and work with cultural and educational workers throughout the city to create greater achievements. He also called on cultural and educational workers throughout the city to launch a more extensive, in-depth, and sustained upsurge in studying Marxism-Leninism and studying Chairman Mao's works, to guide all cultural and educational work with Mao Zedong Thought, and to be enthusiastic and creative propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought; to develop education in a faster, better, and more economical way, to train 700,000 intermediate and senior scientific and technical talents within eight years, and to ensure that the training of talents is fast, the quality of education is high, and the students are healthy. It is necessary to continuously improve the quality of cultural and educational work and strive to reach the national first-class level in all aspects. It is also necessary to carry out a more extensive cultural revolution and change people's spiritual and cultural outlook.

The conference elected 160 representatives of advanced units and advanced workers to attend the National Cultural and Educational Advanced Workers Representative Conference. Chen Wangdao, President of Fudan University, will serve as the head of the Shanghai delegation to the National Cultural and Educational Advanced Workers Representative Conference.

    用出色成绩迎接文教群英会
    北京文教事业出现大普及大提高大繁荣新形势
    上海力争文化教育工作达到全国第一流的水平
    新华社24日讯　首都教育、文化、卫生、体育、新闻系统最近分别举行了先进单位、先进工作者代表会议，总结北京市文教先进工作者代表大会以来的工作成绩和经验，提出新的任务，选出了一百八十个出席全国文教先进工作者代表大会的代表。
    今年2月召开的北京市文教先进工作者代表大会，推动全市文教界先进工作者运动走向新的高潮，各项文教事业出现了继续大普及、大提高、大繁荣的新形势。文教工作者们都以自己的跃进成就向全国文教先进工作者代表大会献礼。
    各高等学校和中等专业学校最近几个月来有两万多师生下厂下乡，参加生产劳动，投身于技术革命浪潮，拜工农为师，在思想革命、技术革命、教学和科学研究方面都取得很大成绩。清华大学仅最近一个多月内就同北京各厂矿协作完成一百七十九项重大技术革新，其中有60％已投入生产；到4月底，师生们就已经提前完成或开始了原定年底甚至三年计划规定要完成的科学研究任务。北京矿业学院师生同工人组成支援农业大队，帮助农村人民公社兴建起农业机械修配厂，制造出土龙门刨床、平地机、点种机等四十多种革新机具。北京师范大学数学系师生冲破数学教学旧体系，在短期内编出了八十二万字的试用教材。许多中、小学都在积极进行各种不同方案的学制改革实验，以提高教学质量为中心的先进教学经验也在遍地开花。全市已有四十二个厂矿建立起了从小学到大学的业余教育体系。
    文化、卫生、体育、新闻工作者近几个月来的成就也很显著。各专业文艺单位纷纷同工厂、工地、人民公社挂钩，作为文艺工作者深入生活、劳动锻炼、辅导群众业余文化活动的固定基地；同时开展群众性创作活动，5月份举行了万紫千红的文艺会演。群众性体育锻炼运动达到高潮，全市陆续举行了两万队篮球赛、五十万人射击运动、十多万人乒乓球赛、十万人野营。各卫生医疗单位派人下乡、下厂、下街道，展开卫生保健预防工作，两个月来普查了高血压、砂眼、风湿症、龋齿等三百四十万人次，帮助基层单位训练了十八万名卫生积极分子。各医院都开展了以科学研究、技术革命为中心的提高医疗质量的群众运动，出现了医疗操作自动装置和精密的医疗器械。
    在文教事业的大普及、大提高、大繁荣中，工人阶级的知识分子队伍正在迅速成长壮大。首都文教界选举出席全国文教先进工作者代表大会的一百八十个代表，就是站在思想革命、文化革命、技术革命前列的尖兵。这里面有著名的老教授、医生、体育工作者、艺术家，也有在平凡的工作中做出不平凡业绩的教师、教养员、卫生员、电影放映员等。还有很多代表，不久前才摆脱文盲状态，而如今已经闯入文化科学的“禁宫”，并且正在勇敢地攀登科学文化的高峰。转业军人、北京大学物理系实验员魏从华，原来“加减乘除”都不熟练，在党的培养下，经过一年多百折不挠的努力，现在已提高到能够掌握复杂光谱分析实验的技术。搬运工人马庆丰几年前还是个半文盲，而现在已经是全市闻名的业余高小教师了。
    全国文教先进工作者代表大会就要开幕了，北京市的代表纷纷表示，一定要以小学生的态度参加大会，虚心向全国各路英雄取经，更好地发挥桥梁、模范、带头作用，同全市文教工作者一起夺取新的胜利。
    据新华社上海24日电　上海市在最近召开了教育和文化、卫生、体育、新闻方面社会主义建设先进单位和先进工作者代表大会。出席大会的全体代表一致表示，要响应中共上海市委的号召，高举毛泽东思想红旗，多快好省地培养社会主义建设人材，力争上海文教事业、文教工作具有第一流的水平，努力攀登科学文化的高峰。
    出席这次大会的代表共七千人，他们都是上海文教战线各方面的优秀人物。会议期间，中共上海市委第一书记、上海市市长柯庆施作了政治报告。市委书记处候补书记石西民作了关于文教工作的报告。市委书记处书记曹荻秋在会议闭幕时，代表市委和市人民委员会向大会选出的七百零四个先进单位和九百三十七名先进工作者祝贺并给奖。
    十年来，特别是大跃进以来，上海文教工作取得了巨大成绩和经验。随着工农业战线上伟大的技术革新和技术革命运动的蓬勃发展，上海文教战线上也出现了大发展、大普及、大提高、大繁荣的新局面。会上，石西民分析全市文教工作取得巨大成就的基本经验说：十年来，上海文教工作取得胜利，首先，是由于坚持了一切文教事业必须在党的领导下，贯彻为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务，教育与生产劳动相结合和发展文教事业的“两条腿走路”方针，并且坚持了理论与实际相结合的根本原则，充分调动了广大群众的积极性。其次，是由于党的知识分子政策的胜利。在党的文教方针胜利贯彻的同时，上海文教工作者队伍的面貌也有了很大改变。在两条道路、两种思想的斗争中，一支又红又专的工人阶级知识分子队伍正在迅速成长。绝大多数知识分子都有了不同程度的进步，大批新的一代的知识分子在不断地涌现出来。大跃进以来，上海教育和文化、卫生、体育、新闻方面，已有三千七百人光荣地参加了党的队伍。文教队伍中越来越多的人，认识到必须实行知识分子和工农群众相结合，下决心同劳动人民打成一片，把自己放在群众之中，这样才能够轻装前进。第三，要多快好省地发展文教事业，必须坚决地依靠群众，贯彻党的群众路线，大搞群众运动；同时，还必须破除迷信，解放思想。上海文教事业的胜利，正是破除迷信，解放思想，不断革命，大搞群众运动的胜利。
    石西民勉励先进工作者永远保持先进，做文教战线上的促进派，同全市文教工作者一道，创造出更大的成绩。他还号召全市文教工作者掀起一个更加广泛、深入、持久的学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛主席著作的热潮，以毛泽东思想指导一切文教工作，做毛泽东思想的热情的、有创造性的宣传员；要多快好省地发展教育事业，在八年内培养七十万名中级和高级的科学技术人材，并且做到培养人材快，教育质量高，学生身体健康。要不断提高文化教育工作的质量，力争在各方面达到全国第一流的水平。还要更广泛地开展文化革命，改变人们的精神文化面貌。
    大会选出了出席全国文教先进工作者代表大会的先进单位和先进工作者代表一百六十人。复旦大学校长陈望道将担任上海出席全国文教先进工作者代表大会代表团团长。
