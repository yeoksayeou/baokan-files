Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 20th: TASS Moscow, May 20th: TASS communique:

    The scheduled exploration program for the satellite spaceship flight was completed on May 19, 1960.
    According to the plan, in order to de-orbit the satellite spaceship, at 2:52 AM (Moscow time) on May 19, the command was issued to activate the braking device and detach the sealed cabin.
    The braking device worked. At the same time, the planned work to maintain the stability of the spaceship during the engine activation was carried out. However, because an instrument in the satellite spaceship's orientation system had malfunctioned by this point, the direction of the reverse thrust deviated from the planned direction. As a result, the speed of the spaceship did not decrease; on the contrary, it increased slightly, and the satellite spaceship entered a new elliptical orbit, which was still almost in the original plane, but its apogee was much higher.
    The sealed cabin detached from the satellite spaceship, and the normal operation of the sealed cabin's stability system was recorded.
    The results of the first launch of the satellite spaceship solved a series of extremely important scientific and technological tasks:
    -- Verified the reliable launch and flight of the powerful carrier rocket according to the planned scheme. This launch and flight ensured that the spaceship entered a near-circular orbit very accurately.
    -- During the flight, the reliable maneuvering and orientation of the satellite spaceship were achieved for several days and nights.
    -- The telemetry data obtained showed that the spaceship's regulation system and temperature control system worked normally throughout the flight and guaranteed the conditions necessary for future human flight.
    -- Communication with the satellite spaceship via telegraph system was normal, while the telephone system, when relaying ground radio station signals through the satellite spaceship's instruments, operated with noise and severe distortion.
    -- The specialized radio equipment, designed to transmit commands to the spaceship, control the spaceship's flight trajectory, and transmit telemetry information from the spaceship regarding the operation of various systems, successfully completed its task.
    -- The automatic orientation solar battery pack operated normally.
    -- All the main devices used to implement the descent were designed correctly and could guarantee the completion of this task.
    The data obtained from the first satellite spaceship flight provided a wealth of material for the realization of future controllable human flight in space and demonstrated the correctness of the basic principles adopted in the manufacture of the spaceship. The results of the above work make it possible to move on to the next stage of testing.
    The satellite spaceship and the sealed cabin near it are currently orbiting with a period of 94.25 minutes. The perigee of the orbit is 307 kilometers, and the apogee is 690 kilometers. The angle between the orbit and the equatorial plane is 65 degrees.
    The final stage of the carrier rocket continues to operate along its previous orbit.
    The "Signal" radio transmitter installed on the satellite spaceship continues to operate normally, constantly transmitting information to the ground about the operation of various systems and instruments.

    为人在宇宙中作可控制的飞行提供了大量材料
    苏联宇宙飞船考察计划完成
    掣动装置起了作用　密封舱已脱离了飞船
    新华社20日讯　塔斯社莫斯科20日讯：塔斯社公报：
    卫星式飞船飞行的预定考察计划已经在1960年5月19日完成。
    根据计划，为了使卫星式飞船从轨道上下降，在5月19日二时五十二分（莫斯科时间）发出了开动掣动装置和使密封舱脱离的命令。
    掣动装置已经起了作用。同时进行了预定的使飞船在发动装置工作的时候保持稳定的工作。但是由于到这时卫星式飞船定向系统的一个仪器已经发生了故障，反推力的方向偏离了预定的方向。结果，飞船的速度没有减低，反而略有增加，卫星式飞船进入了新的椭圆形轨道，这条轨道差不多还在原来的平面上，但是它的远地点要高得多。
    密封舱已经脱离了卫星式飞船，并且纪录到了密封舱稳定系统的正常工作情况。
    第一次发射卫星式飞船的结果解决了一系列极重大的科学和技术任务：
    ——检验了强大的运载火箭按照预定方案可靠的起飞和飞行情况。这种起飞和飞行保证了宇宙飞船非常准确地进入接近圆形轨道。
    ——在飞行过程中，在几昼夜的时间内，实现了对卫星式飞船的可靠的操纵和它的定向工作。
    ——已获得的遥测材料表明，在整个飞行期间，飞船的调节系统和温度调节系统工作正常，并保证了人将来飞行时所必需的条件。
    ——通过电报系统同卫星式飞船进行的联系是正常的，而电话系统，在通过卫星式飞船的仪器转播地面无线电站讯号时，工作却是在有噪音和严重失真的情况下进行。
    ——预定用来向飞船传送命令、控制飞船的飞行轨道以及从飞船上发下关于飞船的各种系统工作情况的遥测情报的专门无线电装置，成功地完成了自己的任务。
    ——自动定向太阳能电池组工作情况正常。
    ——用来实现下降的全部主要装置设计正确，并可以保证完成这一任务。
    通过第一次卫星式飞船飞行所得来的数据，为实现未来的人在宇宙中的可控制的飞行，提供了大量材料，并且显示了制造宇宙飞船时所采用的基本原理的正确性。进行上述工作的结果，使得有可能转入下一步的试验阶段。
    卫星式飞船和在它附近的密封舱，目前正在沿着运行周期为九十四点二五分钟的轨道运行。轨道的近地点为三百零七公里，远地点为六百九十公里。轨道同赤道平面的交角为六十五度。
    运载火箭的最后一级继续沿着以前的轨道运行。
    卫星式飞船上所安装的“信号”无线电发射机继续正常工作，不断向地面发出关于各种系统和仪器工作情况的情报。
