On the Revolutionary Base Area of Hainan
	Guan Xin

What changes have taken place at the State-owned Sanmenpo Farm, the revolutionary base area where the people of Hainan waged revolutionary struggles before liberation, and where soldiers fought the enemy many times? One evening, in a two-story meeting room, Su Huanmin and Fu Xishu, the farm's Party committee secretaries, and other comrades, introduced us to the farm's situation. Most of them are veteran soldiers of the Qiongya Column from those years, who persisted in the revolutionary struggle in this area and were among the first pioneers here. They are very familiar with the present and past of this place and have a deep love for it. Farm Party Secretary Su Huanmin's home is in Pandan Village near Sanmenpo. In 1936, during the revolutionary upsurge, he joined the Chinese Communist Party and later served as village branch secretary, district committee secretary, and other positions. After Japanese imperialism set foot on Hainan in 1938, he also joined the guerrillas. Those were years of arduous struggle. The Japanese devils and the Kuomintang colluded together to encircle and suppress the revolutionary base areas. The guerrillas, led by the Party, resolutely fought the enemy with the support and cover of the masses. The blood of countless revolutionary martyrs was shed on the land of Sanmenpo. These scenes of revolutionary struggle from that time are still deeply etched in the memories of the soldiers today, and will forever be a force to inspire them forward. These soldiers from those years have now become commanders on the production front, and some have become excellent tractor drivers. The revolutionary tradition is being carried forward in new undertakings, and a beautiful farm has been built on the land stained red with the blood of the martyrs.

Hainan is the motherland's tropical island treasure. After Hainan's liberation in 1950, the people of Hainan, with their tradition of revolutionary struggle, actively launched the cause of developing tropical resources under the leadership of the Party. In 1952, a portion of the Hainan Military Region troops (formerly the Qiongya Column) was ordered to reorganize into the First Forestry Engineering Division of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, establishing the first batch of state-owned farms in various parts of Hainan. Sanmenpo Farm was established at this time.

Over the past eight years, the farm's workers have inherited the revolutionary fighting tradition of the Sanmenpo people, fearlessly fighting against nature. Now, their tremendous labor has yielded fruitful results. Rows of straight windbreak forest belts have formed a strong forest network on the land. A wide variety of tropical crops, under its protection, are growing vigorously. Rubber trees are exuding milky white latex, and coffee trees are covered with abundant fruit... one after another.

Sanmenpo is a vast grassland. The cogongrass grows taller than a person, and the evaporation rate of moisture is greater than the rainfall throughout the year, making the land dry and cracked. In particular, the large typhoons in autumn each year not only blow the branches and leaves of the crops to pieces, but even lift the workers' thatched houses as a whole. Typhoons, cogongrass, and drought have become the three major enemies of the workers. The leadership called on the workers to carry forward the revolutionary tradition, overcome the new "three major enemies," and build Sanmenpo into a large tropical crop garden for the motherland. The farm formulated a large-scale afforestation plan to build a green Great Wall on the grassland and completely transform the farm's natural environment.

Afforestation in such a dry place is also not an easy task. The windbreak forests must be planted on high slopes, and the workers have to carry water in buckets from several miles away to the slopes, pouring it into the dry soil and planting the seedlings. The hot climate and arduous labor leave the workers breathless. However, whenever the leadership tells everyone to take a break and then continue, they reply: "We can defeat the Kuomintang and imperialism, so what does this little difficulty amount to!" In this way, after a major campaign throughout the autumn of 1955, the entire farm completed the afforestation plan ahead of schedule. Immediately afterwards, a cogongrass removal campaign was launched, and in 1956, the cogongrass in the forest sections was eliminated in one fell swoop. Now, the windbreak forests have grown up. With these green Great Walls, typhoons can no longer wreak havoc. After the cogongrass in the forest sections was eliminated, terraced fields were built and cover crops were planted, preventing soil erosion and increasing the moisture in the soil. The farm's natural environment has undergone fundamental changes, and all kinds of crops are growing vigorously. The planting area of crops is expanding day by day. To date, the planting area of tropical crops and agricultural crops on this farm has expanded to nearly 100,000 mu. Moreover, since 1958, it has been providing the state with tropical crop products in large quantities, year after year.

Sanmenpo Farm also makes use of the farm's favorable conditions to implement the policy of "diversified operations, combining agriculture and animal husbandry," and vigorously develops animal husbandry. Now, all eleven work areas of the farm are actively developing pig raising and three-bird breeding, among which the Red Flag Work Area focuses on animal husbandry, undertaking the task of providing products and breeding seedlings to the state. The pig farm in this Red Flag Work Area is built in the middle of a large feed base. Many papayas and bananas are planted around the pig farm. The breeders say that papayas and bananas are very nutritious. Sows that eat them can increase milk production, and piglets that eat them grow quickly. They now raise more than 250 local improved breed sows and more than a dozen Soviet improved breed boars. Crossbreeding these two pig breeds results in a high pregnancy rate for sows, and the piglets are also numerous and grow large.

After Chairman Mao called for "large-scale and special pig raising," the farm's enthusiasm for developing animal husbandry became even higher. Last year, the entire farm only raised more than 1,000 pigs. This year, the plan is to develop to 10,000 pigs, and strive to develop to 100,000 pigs in three to five years. The farm Party committee also pays special attention to developing economic forest chicken farming. Now, each work area is actively establishing forest chicken farms. They plan to strive to raise 1 million chickens on the entire farm in three to five years. At that time, the beautiful tropical economic forest park will become even more beautiful and colorful.

    在海南革命根据地上
    关欣
    国营三门坡农场这个解放前海南人民进行革命斗争的根据地，战士们多少次与敌人进行搏斗的地方，如今起了哪些变化呢？一天晚上，在一座双层楼的会议室里，农场党委书记苏焕民、符锡书等同志，为我们介绍了这个农场的情况。他们之中，大多数人都是当年琼崖纵队的老战士，在这个地区坚持过革命斗争，又是这里的第一批垦荒者，对这个地方的现在和过去都十分熟悉，对她怀有一种深厚的爱。农场党委书记苏焕民同志的家就在三门坡附近的攀丹村。1936年革命高潮的时候，他加入了中国共产党，后来担任过村支部书记、区委书记等职。1938年日本帝国主义的铁蹄踏上海南以后，他又参加了游击队。那是一个斗争艰苦的年代。日本鬼子和国民党勾结在一起，对革命根据地实行夹攻。党所领导的游击队，在群众的支持与掩护下，坚决地打击了敌人。无数革命先烈的热血，洒在三门坡的土地上。这些当年革命斗争的情景，今天还深深地留在战士们的记忆中，永远成为鼓舞他们前进的力量。这些当年的战士们，现在，有的已成生产战线上的指挥员，有的已成了优秀的拖拉机手。革命的传统在新的事业中发扬光大，被先烈们的热血染红了的土地上，已经建起了美丽的农场。
    海南，是祖国热带的宝岛，1950年，海南解放后，具有革命斗争传统的海南人民，又在党的领导下，积极地开展了开发热带资源的事业，1952年，海南军区的部分部队（即原来的琼崖纵队），奉命改编为中国人民解放军林业工程第一师，在海南各地建立第一批国营农场，三门坡农场就是在这个时候建立的。
    八年来，农场的职工们继承了三门坡人民革命的战斗传统，不畏艰苦地与大自然作斗争。现在，他们所付出的巨大劳动，已结出了丰硕的果实，一条条笔直的防护林带，已在大地上结成强固的林网，品种繁多的热带作物，在它的护卫下，蓬勃地生长起来，橡胶树流出了乳白色胶液，咖啡树上结满了累累的果实……，一片连着一片。
    三门坡是一片莽莽的草原地。茅草长得有人高，一年中水分蒸发量比降雨量大，土地旱得干巴巴的。特别是每年秋季的大台风，别说是作物被刮得枝残叶落，连工人们住的草房，也整栋的被掀起来。台风、茅草、干旱，成了职工们的三大敌人。领导上号召工人们发扬革命的传统，战胜新的“三大敌人”，一定要把三门坡建成祖国的热带作物大花园。农场制订了大规模造林规划，要在草原上建起绿色的长城，彻底改造农场的自然环境。
    在这样干旱的地方造林，同样是件不容易的事。防护林要种在高坡上，工人们要从几里远的地方，把水一担担地挑到坡上来，浇在干燥的泥土里，把树苗栽下去。炎热的气候，艰苦的劳动，把工人累得喘不过气来。但是，每当领导上让大家歇歇再干的时候，他们却回答说：“国民党、帝国主义都能打倒，这点困难算得什么。”就这样，全场经过1955年一个秋天的大突击，提前完成了造林计划。紧接着，又掀起除茅运动，在1956年一举消灭了林段中的茅草，现在，防护林已经生长起来，有了这些绿色的长城，台风再不能逞凶了。林段茅草消灭以后，又修建了梯田，种上了复盖作物，水土不再流失，土壤中的水分也增加了。农场的自然环境起了根本的变化，各种作物都蓬勃地生长起来，作物的种植面积在天天扩大。到目前为止，这个农场热带作物和农作物种植面积，已经扩大到近十万亩。而且，从1958年开始，已经一年比一年多地向国家大批提供热带作物产品。
    三门坡农场还利用了农场的有利条件，实行“多种经营、农牧结合”的方针，大力发展畜牧业。现在，全场十一个作业区，都积极发展养猪和饲养三鸟事业，其中红旗作业区以畜牧业为主，担负着向国家提供产品和繁殖种苗的任务。这个红旗作业区的猪场就建立在一大片饲料基地中间，猪场周围种有许多木瓜和芭蕉，饲养员介绍说，木瓜和芭蕉的营养价值很高，母猪吃了能增加奶汁，小猪吃了长的快。他们现在养有二百五十多头本地良种母猪，十几头苏联的良种公猪，这两个猪种杂交，母猪的满怀率很高，生的小猪也多，长得也大。
    毛主席号召“大养特养其猪”以后，农场发展畜牧业的积极性更高了。去年全场养猪才一千多头，今年计划发展到一万头，争取三、五年后发展到十万头。农场党委还特别重视发展经济林园养鸡，现在，各个作业区都在积极的建立林园鸡场，他们计划在三、五年以后，争取全场养鸡达到一百万只。那时，美丽的热带经济林园将变得更加美丽多彩了。（附图片）
