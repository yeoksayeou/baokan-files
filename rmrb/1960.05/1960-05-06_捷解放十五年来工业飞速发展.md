    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 5th: Czechoslovakia's industry has developed rapidly in the fifteen years since liberation. At present, its industrial output has increased to four times that of 1937, the most developed year for industry before liberation; industry accounts for about 85% of the total industrial and agricultural output.
    Although Czechoslovakia's population accounts for only 0.5% of the world's population, it produces 2% of the world's industrial products. In terms of per capita industrial output, Czechoslovakia is one of the most advanced countries in the world; its per capita output of some major industrial products has caught up with or even surpassed the most developed capitalist countries.
    For example, Czechoslovakia's per capita coal production (calculated in terms of hard coal) is 4,449 kilograms, exceeding the United States, West Germany, Britain, and France; steel is 1,409 kilograms, exceeding Britain and France, and approaching the level of the United States and West Germany; electricity is 1,456 kilowatt-hours, exceeding France and approaching the level of West Germany. Czechoslovakia ranks first in the world in terms of per capita shoe production.
    Since liberation, Czechoslovakia's industry has been advancing at an average annual growth rate of 11.7%. During the same period, the average growth rate of American industry was only 2.5%, and Britain's was 3.4%.
    Czechoslovakia's industrial achievements have completely shattered the slander of some Western economists that socialism is only suitable for economically backward countries. It proves that a country like Czechoslovakia, which originally had a fairly developed industry, can also develop much faster under the socialist system than capitalist countries.
    In the past fifteen years, the development of Czechoslovakia's industry has changed the malformed phenomenon of extremely unbalanced industrial layout. Before liberation, more than 90% of the country's industry was concentrated in the western Czech and Moravian regions, while the eastern Slovak region had very little industry. After liberation, the industry in the Slovak region has developed rapidly. At present, the industry in this region has increased by 7.6 times compared with 1937, and its share in the national industry has also increased from 8% in 1937 to 17.7%.
    The irrational structure of the industry has also been changed. Before liberation, Czechoslovakia's industry was mainly light industry, and many equipment depended on Western capitalist countries. Almost no complex industrial sector was self-contained. After liberation, Czechoslovakia implemented a restructuring of the economic structure and established an independent industrial system based on heavy industry, especially machine manufacturing. At present, the proportion of production materials in Czechoslovakia's total industrial production is nearly 64%. Machine manufacturing, especially heavy machine manufacturing, has become the primary sector in industry, accounting for more than 30% of the total industry. Czechoslovakia ranks fourth in the world in terms of per capita machine production.
    During the upcoming Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), Czechoslovakia's industry will be further developed. In 1965, its industrial production will increase by 50% compared with 1960, and by five times compared with 1937. By then, it will be able to produce the entire year's industrial products of 1937 in two months. (Attached picture)

    捷解放十五年来工业飞速发展
    目前工业产值增为1937年的四倍　工业占工农业总产值的85％左右
    主要工业品产量按人口平均计已赶上或超过最发达的资本主义国家
    新华社布拉格5日电　解放十五年来，捷克斯洛伐克工业发展十分迅速。目前，它的工业产值已提高为解放前工业最发达的年代1937年的四倍；工业在工农业总产值中所占的比重已达85％左右。
    虽然捷克斯洛伐克的人口只占全世界人口的0.5％，但它却生产着全世界2％的工业产品。在按人口平均计算的工业产品产量方面，捷克斯洛伐克是世界上最先进的国家之一；它的一些主要工业产品按人口平均计算的产量已经赶上，甚至超过了最发达的资本主义国家。
    例如，捷克斯洛伐克按人口平均计算的煤产量（折合成硬煤计算）为四千四百四十九公斤，超过了美国、西德、英国和法国；钢一四百零九公斤，超过了英国和法国，接近美国和西德的水平；电力—一千四百五十六度，超过了法国，接近西德的水平。在按人口平均计算的制鞋工业产量方面，捷克斯洛伐克占世界第一位。
    解放以来，捷克斯洛伐克的工业以平均每年增长11.7％的速度前进着。而在同一时期，美国工业的平均增长速度只有2.5％，英国是3.4％。
    捷克斯洛伐克工业的发展成就彻底粉碎了某些西方经济学家所谓社会主义只适合于经济落后的国家的谰言。它证明：像捷克斯洛伐克这样原来工业就相当发达的国家，在社会主义制度下也会以比资本主义国家快得多的速度发展。
    十五年以来，捷克斯洛伐克工业的发展改变了过去工业布局十分不平衡的畸形现象。解放前，全国工业的90％以上集中在西部的捷克和摩拉维亚地区，而东部的斯洛伐克地区只有很少一点工业。解放后，斯洛伐克地区的工业得到了迅速的发展，目前，这一地区的工业比1937年提高了七点六倍，而它在全国工业中所占的比重也从1937年的8％提高到了17.7％。
    在工业结构方面也改变了过去不合理的状况。解放以前的捷克斯洛伐克工业以轻工业为主，有许多设备要依赖着西方资本主义国家，几乎没有一个较复杂的工业部门是自成体系的。解放后，捷克斯洛伐克实行了经济结构的改组，建立了以重工业为主，特别是以机器制造业为中心的独立的工业体系。目前，捷克斯洛伐克生产资料的生产在整个工业生产中所占的比重已将近64％。机器制造业、特别是重型机器制造业成了工业中的首要部门，它在全部工业中的比重已占30％以上。在按人口平均计算的机器生产方面，捷克斯洛伐克占世界第四位。
    在即将开始的第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）期间，捷克斯洛伐克的工业将有进一步的发展。1965年，它的工业生产将要比1960年增长50％，而与1937年比较，则将增长五倍。到那时，它每两个月就能生产1937年全年的工业产品。（附图片）
