    新华社20日讯　雅加达消息：据报道，印度尼西亚有关当局禁止反对荷兰殖民主义者军事挑衅的示威，参加示威的人遭到逮捕和审讯。据雅加达报纸报道，5月6日上千的印度尼西亚的青年在荷兰驻印度尼西亚外交代表团办公处前面举行示威，抗议荷兰增派军队和航空母舰到西伊里安。雅加达陆军当局出动警察驱散了示威者，拘捕了参加示威的大学生，并且在7日加以审讯。
    后来，一个陆军发言人说，“工会如再允许示威，武装部队将继续保卫荷兰大使馆和代办的住宅。”
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，雅加达第五军区司令威腊哈迪库苏马上校在5月7日对报界说，他对6日的群众示威表示“很遗憾”。据报道，这位司令还采取了“纪律措施”。他还指责示威者“轻举妄动”，要求雅加达市民“警惕”，不要受“煽动”。
    雅加达警察局9日宣布，未经陆军当局的许可，不得举行示威。
    据印度尼西亚新闻社报道，印度尼西亚外交部代理发言人埃芬迪5月6日评论学生的爱国示威时也说：“我们对于发生这件事情非常遗憾。”
    另据泗水消息，5月13日在泗水也爆发了大规模的反荷兰帝国主义的示威。泗水的陆军当局逮捕了同散发反荷兰标语有关的人。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，泗水军事司令部新闻官阿布马南中尉说，这次游行公开违抗了东爪哇战时掌权者1958年5月17日公布的法令，这项法令规定，一切游行示威均在被禁止之列。他又说，地方省当局将采取措施来对付违反这项法令的人。
