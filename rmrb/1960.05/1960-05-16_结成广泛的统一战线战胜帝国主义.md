Form a Broad United Front to Defeat Imperialism
"Hongqi" Commentator

Imperialism, headed by the United States, is stirring up a tidal wave of revolutionary struggles by oppressed people everywhere. The national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are developing wave upon wave, surging forward irresistibly. On the African continent, the flames of anti-colonialism are burning everywhere. A series of countries have declared independence or achieved a certain degree of independence, and are continuing to fight against imperialism in order to consolidate their existing achievements and strive for complete independence. The Algerian people are heroically persisting in their armed struggle against imperialism. People in many parts of East Africa, Central Africa, and West Africa are rising up to fight for independence. Africans in the Union of South Africa have launched a large-scale struggle against racial discrimination. Latin America has been transformed from a tightly controlled "backyard" of the United States into a front against U.S. imperialism. The Cuban people, who have achieved great success in the national democratic revolution, are defending the fruits of the revolution and resolutely opposing the U.S. intervention conspiracy. The people of Nicaragua, Dominica, and Paraguay have launched armed struggles against the U.S.-backed dictatorial regimes. In Asia, the national democratic movement is developing more deeply and widely. For more than a year, centering on the opposition to the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the Japanese people have repeatedly launched increasingly large-scale anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggles, and are currently carrying out an unprecedented Sixteenth Unified Action. Recently, the struggle of the South Korean people against U.S. imperialism and its lackey Syngman Rhee's fascist rule, like a volcanic eruption, has shaken U.S. imperialism's colonial rule in Asia. Immediately afterwards, the Turkish people ignited the flames of struggle against the U.S.-backed Menderes dictatorial government.

The struggles of the South Korean and Turkish people, which took place in America's two most loyal "allies," in America's two war bases in Asia, and in America's two "strong anti-communist fortresses" in its mind, are significant events. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "This struggle of the South Korean and Turkish people shows that the storm of the struggle of the oppressed people of Asian countries against imperialism and its lackeys will rise even greater. This struggle will be a support for the just struggles of the people of Africa, the people of Latin America, and the people of the world."

Wherever there is imperialist aggression, oppression, and plunder, there is resistance and struggle from the people. No matter what cruel rule and suppression or deception methods the U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in various countries use, the people of all oppressed nations' struggle for national independence and democracy cannot be stopped or bound. This is an inevitable law of human historical development that cannot be changed by the subjective wishes of any reactionaries. U.S. imperialism plays the role of world policeman in suppressing the revolutions and national liberation movements of the people of all countries. It supports the most reactionary and decadent forces everywhere in the capitalist world, enslaves and plunders the people of all countries. This inevitably leads to the continuous sharpening and expansion of its contradictions with the people of all countries, thereby arousing the resistance and struggle of the people of all countries. The recent popular revolts in South Korea and Turkey were caused by the long-term sinful rule of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. Take South Korea for example. Everyone knows that the United States supported its faithful dog Syngman Rhee in establishing an extremely reactionary, corrupt, dark, and barbarous fascist rule there. The U.S. occupation forces ran rampant and committed all kinds of evils. Under the crazy plunder of the U.S.-Rhee clique, South Korea's economy went bankrupt across the board, and the people generally lived in poverty. The South Korean people were deprived of all rights politically. The U.S.-Rhee clique turned South Korea into a large concentration camp and prison. In 1959 alone, more than 240,000 South Korean people were arrested, imprisoned, and killed. The U.S.-Rhee clique thought that by doing so, they could suppress the people's resistance and maintain their rule. The development of history is exactly the opposite of the wishes of the reactionaries. The more cruel the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Rhee clique, the deeper the people's anger will accumulate, and the stronger their resistance will inevitably become. Since the U.S. military occupied South Korea, especially since the establishment of the Syngman Rhee puppet government, the South Korean people have continuously launched various resistance struggles and even armed guerrilla struggles. This large-scale demonstration that swept through the cities of South Korea is a new upsurge in the South Korean people's struggle against the U.S.-Rhee clique. Under the impact of the powerful tide of popular struggle, Syngman Rhee, the United States' faithful dog who ruled South Korea for twelve years, was finally overthrown. In many other places under the control of U.S. imperialism, there are also volcanoes that can erupt at any time.

Imperialism and reactionaries in all countries have always had two hands in dealing with the resistance struggle of oppressed people: one is violent suppression, and the other is deception. U.S. imperialism is implementing a policy of aggression and expansion, and is being severely attacked by the people everywhere. Its days are getting harder and harder. Recently, in order to deal with the resistance of the people of various countries enslaved by it, U.S. imperialism, while continuing to adopt violent suppression, has tried to adopt some more cunning and deceptive strategies. In this South Korean incident, on the one hand, the United States dispatched the 15th Division of the South Korean puppet army, which is directly under the U.S. military command in Korea, carrying tanks, armored vehicles, and rocket launchers to enter Seoul to suppress the demonstrators. On the other hand, it adopted a series of deceptive methods to cover up its true face as the chief culprit, attempting to continue its bloody colonial rule in South Korea. When Syngman Rhee had to step down under the people's attack, the United States instructed another of its faithful dogs, Huh Chung, to organize a so-called "caretaker cabinet." Under the direction of its U.S. master, Huh Chung is stepping up the performance of a fake democratic farce, falsely claiming that he will “respect public opinion,” “welcome constructive criticism,” and carry out “revolutionary reforms.” The South Korean people, who have suffered deeply under the sinful rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs for more than ten years, will never believe this kind of deception. As long as the sinful rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs does not end, and as long as the suffering of the South Korean people is not relieved, their struggle will not stop for a day. The fact that the South Korean people are still constantly holding demonstrations after Huh Chung came to power is powerful proof. The people of Busan said: "We lived in shacks during the U.S. military government's rule, we also lived in shacks under Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party's rule, and we are still living in shacks now. We must change this situation!" This shows that the broad masses of awakened South Korean people are determined to eradicate the root causes of oppression, enslavement, hunger, and poverty, and to persevere in the struggle to the end. Even some Western news agencies admit that the South Korean people's resistance struggle "will inevitably continue to occur, and there will be more suppression, until the regime is finally overthrown. This may take two weeks or two years, but it is inevitable in the end." In Turkey or other places controlled by the United States, the United States may also adopt more cunning deceptive methods to ease the people's resistance, but it can be affirmed that this attempt will also not succeed. Imperialism and reactionaries are teachers by negative example for the people. The people will be tempered, educated, and learn how to defeat the enemy through struggle. The more reactionary the enemy is, the more it will stimulate the people's revolutionary nature, and the more the enemy will be on the verge of death. Neither suppression nor deception can save the reactionary rule from its inevitable doom.

While U.S. imperialism is stepping up its deception of the people of all countries, modern revisionists are shamefully playing the role of accomplices. Modern revisionists advocate "peaceful cooperation" between oppressors and oppressed, between imperialism and the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries. In their depiction, the nature of imperialism seems to have changed, as if imperialism has abandoned violence and policies of aggression and expansion, and has become very peaceful. How ridiculous their rhetoric appears in the face of real life. When South Korea and Turkey are densely covered with U.S. military bases, and U.S. occupation forces are ravaging the people there, when the people there are subjected to cruel plunder, hunger, and destitution, and have no way out, when the people there are deprived of all rights and tens of thousands of them are thrown into prisons and slaughtered, can they believe that the nature of imperialism has changed and that reactionaries are no longer reactionaries? The very fact that the South Korean and Turkish people have risen up to struggle powerfully refutes the modern revisionist fallacy of "peaceful cooperation" between oppressors and oppressed. The South Korean people originally wanted to achieve their goals through peaceful demonstrations, but the rulers used tanks, artillery, machine guns, and bayonets to deal with them. When the demonstrating masses were brutally slaughtered and their blood spilled all over the streets of Seoul and other cities, can they believe the deceptive nonsense that imperialism and its running dogs will abandon violence? Now, the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging unprecedentedly, the people in many places are launching armed guerrilla struggles against imperialism and its running dogs, and the Algerian people are persistently and victoriously carrying out the national liberation war. All these facts ruthlessly expose the deception of modern revisionism and prove the bankruptcy of modern revisionism.

The South Korean people's struggle against the U.S.-Rhee fascist rule has achieved its first victory, and the Turkish people's struggle against the Menderes traitorous dictatorial government is in full swing. To thoroughly realize their goals, the South Korean and Turkish people must go through a difficult, complex, and tortuous struggle process. U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in South Korea and Turkey will inevitably try every means to suppress the people's resistance. However, the patriotic and just struggles of the South Korean and Turkish people have the support of the people of the world. As long as the people of South Korea and Turkey unite as one and persevere in the struggle to the end, they will surely be able to achieve their goals.

The victory of the Cuban revolution is a shining example. Cuba is a country with only 6.5 million people, isolated in the Caribbean Sea, with the most ferocious imperialism—the United States—nearby. The enemy faced by the Cuban people in the revolutionary process was this most ferocious imperialism and the Batista dictatorial regime it had trained and armed to the teeth. Batista implemented a reign of terror against the Cuban people. During his rule, as many as 20,000 revolutionaries were brutally murdered. Because the Cuban people were closely united and persisted in their struggle for a long time, and after two years of guerrilla warfare, they finally overthrew the traitorous dictatorial regime and achieved victory in the national democratic revolution. After the victory of the Cuban revolution, the United States was unwilling to accept its defeat and tried every means to sabotage and plot subversion against Cuba, not only exerting economic and diplomatic pressure, threatening and intimidating, but also sending planes to bomb, creating explosions, and training rebels to prepare for attacks. The heroic Cuban people were not intimidated. Their determination to defend the revolution and advance the revolution became stronger and stronger. They destroyed the old state apparatus, resolutely suppressed counter-revolutionaries, and implemented land reform. They bravely fought back against U.S. intervention and defended national independence. In order to effectively combat the sabotage activities of enemies at home and abroad, they universally implemented military training and organized militias. The heroic struggle of the Cuban people greatly encouraged the people of Latin America and the people of the world, and severely hit U.S. imperialism's policies of aggression and war. The Cuban people's struggle shows that once the oppressed people awaken, take action, and persist in fighting for their own liberation, they will turn from the weak to the strong and show incomparably powerful strength, while imperialism and its running dogs will turn from the strong to the weak and reveal the original form of paper tigers. What the Cuban people can do, the South Korean people, the Turkish people, and all other oppressed people can certainly do.

Imperialism, headed by the United States, is the common enemy of the people of the world. Imperialism not only exploits and oppresses its own people, but also enslaves and loots the people of other countries. U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious and aggressive imperialism of our time. The U.S. ruling clique is frantically expanding its armaments and preparing for war, organizing aggressive military blocs, vigorously supporting the revival of militarism in Japan and West Germany, arrogantly interfering in and suppressing the revolutionary movements of the people of all countries, opposing all progressive and just causes, carrying out sabotage, subversion, military encirclement, and even war provocations against socialist countries, seriously threatening and undermining world peace. If the proletariat of capitalist countries wants to achieve liberation, if the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries want to achieve national independence, and if the people of the world want to safeguard world peace and achieve the victory of all progressive and just causes, they must wage a resolute struggle against imperialism, first and foremost U.S. imperialism. In the struggle against imperialism and its running dogs, the people of all countries need to unite and support each other. Only by combining the struggles of the people of socialist countries, the national liberation struggles of the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries, the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat of capitalist countries, and the struggles of the people of all countries for peace can we defeat imperialism and its running dogs and achieve lasting world peace. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:
  "The life of imperialism will not be very long. They have done all kinds of bad things, and the oppressed people of the whole world will never forgive them." "In order to defeat the reactionary rule of imperialism, it is necessary to form a broad united front, to unite all forces that can be united, excluding the enemy, and to continue the arduous struggle." The liberated Chinese people have always regarded resolutely supporting the just struggles of the people of all countries as their noble internationalist responsibility. The Chinese people will never forget the support of the people of all countries, and will never forget to use their own efforts to support the struggles of the people of all countries. We will always stand firmly on the side of the people of all countries and oppose imperialism. We believe that as long as the people of the world unite and persist in the struggle, they will surely be able to defeat imperialism and all its running dogs and achieve final victory.

    结成广泛的统一战线战胜帝国主义
    “红旗”评论员
    以美国为首的帝国主义到处都在激起被压迫人民革命斗争的怒潮。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动正一浪接一浪、汹涌澎湃地向前发展，势不可挡。在非洲大陆，到处燃起了反殖民主义的烽火。一系列的国家宣布了独立或者取得了一定程度的独立，正在为巩固已有的斗争成果和争取彻底的独立而同帝国主义继续进行着斗争。阿尔及利亚人民英勇地坚持着反对帝国主义的武装斗争，东非、中非和西非许多地方的人民纷纷起来争取独立，南非联邦的非洲人展开了反对种族歧视的大规模斗争。拉丁美洲已经由被控制极严的美国“后院”变成反对美帝国主义的前线。取得了民族民主革命的巨大成就的古巴人民，正在保卫革命的成果，坚决反对美国的干涉阴谋。尼加拉瓜、多米尼加、巴拉圭的人民开展了武装斗争，反对美国扶植的独裁政权。在亚洲，民族民主运动正在更加深入更加广泛地开展。一年多来，围绕着反对日美军事同盟条约，日本人民一次又一次地掀起了声势越来越大的反美爱国正义斗争，目前正在开展规模空前的第十六次统一行动。最近，南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义和它的走狗李承晚法西斯统治的斗争，像火山爆发一样，震撼了美帝国主义在亚洲的殖民统治。紧接着，土耳其人民又燃起了反对美国支持的曼德列斯独裁政府的斗争烈火。
    南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民的斗争，发生在美国的两个最忠实的“盟国”，发生在美国在亚洲的两个战争基地，发生在美国心目中的两个“强大的反共堡垒”，这是具有重大意义的事件。正如毛泽东同志所指出的：“南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民的这种斗争，表明亚洲各国受压迫人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴，将会有更大的兴起。这个斗争对于非洲人民、拉丁美洲人民以及全世界人民的正义斗争都将是一种支持。”
    哪里有帝国主义的侵略、压迫和掠夺，哪里就有人民的反抗和斗争。不论美帝国主义及其在各国的走狗使用什么残酷统治和镇压、欺骗手段，一切被压迫民族的人民争取民族独立和民主的斗争都是阻挡不住、束缚不了的。这是任何反动派的主观愿望所改变不了的人类历史发展的必然规律。美帝国主义担当着镇压各国人民革命和民族解放运动的世界宪兵的角色，在资本主义世界到处扶植最反动最腐朽的势力，奴役和掠夺各国人民，这就必然使它同各国人民的矛盾不断尖锐、扩大起来，从而引起各国人民的反抗斗争。最近在南朝鲜和土耳其爆发的人民的反抗斗争，就是美帝国主义和它的走狗多年来的罪恶统治所引起的。拿南朝鲜来说，人们都知道，美国扶植它的忠实走狗李承晚在那里建立了极端反动、腐朽、黑暗、野蛮的法西斯统治。美国占领军在那里横行霸道，无恶不作。在美李集团的疯狂掠夺下，南朝鲜的经济全面破产，人民生活普遍贫困。南朝鲜人民在政治上被剥夺了一切权利。美李集团把南朝鲜变成了一座大集中营和大牢狱，仅1959年被逮捕、监禁和杀害的南朝鲜人民就有二十四万多人。美李集团以为这样做，就可以镇压人民的反抗，维持他们的统治。历史的发展恰恰和反动派的愿望相反。美李集团的反动统治越残酷，人民的愤怒也就蓄积越深，他们的反抗也就必然会越来越强烈。自从美军占领南朝鲜特别是李承晚傀儡政府建立以来，南朝鲜的人民就不断展开了各种反抗斗争以至武装游击斗争。这次席卷了南朝鲜大小城市的大示威，是南朝鲜人民反对美李集团斗争的新的高潮。在人民斗争的强大怒潮的冲击下，统治南朝鲜十二年的美国忠实走狗李承晚终于被赶下了台。在美帝国主义控制下的其他许多地方，也都是一个个随时可以爆发的火山。
    帝国主义和各国反动派对待被压迫人民的反抗斗争从来就有两手：一手是暴力镇压，一手是欺骗。美帝国主义实行侵略、扩张政策，到处遭到人民的痛击，它的日子越来越不好过了。最近一个时期，美帝国主义为了对付受它奴役的各国人民的反抗，在继续采取暴力镇压的同时，力图采取一些更加狡猾、更具欺骗性的策略。在这次南朝鲜事件中，美国一方面派遣侵朝美军司令部所直接管辖的南朝鲜傀儡军第十五师团，携带坦克、装甲车和火箭炮开入汉城，镇压示威群众，另一方面，采取了一系列的欺骗手段来掩盖它的罪魁祸首的真面目，企图继续保持它在南朝鲜的血腥的殖民统治。当李承晚在人民的打击下不得不下台的时候，美国指使它的另一个忠实走狗许政出来组织所谓“看守内阁”。在美国主子的导演下，许政正在加紧演出假民主的丑剧，胡诌什么他将“尊重舆论”，“欢迎建设性的批评”，要进行“革命改革”。在美帝国主义和它的走狗十多年罪恶统治下深受苦难的南朝鲜人民，是决不会相信这种欺骗的。美帝国主义和它的走狗的罪恶统治一天不结束，南朝鲜人民的苦难一天不解除，他们的斗争也就一天不会停止。许政上台以后，南朝鲜人民仍然不断举行示威斗争，就是有力的证明。釜山的人民说：“在美国军政府统治时期我们是住窝棚，在李承晚的自由党的统治下我们也是住窝棚，现在还是住窝棚，一定要改变这种状况！”这表明，广大的觉醒了的南朝鲜人民，决心要拔除压迫、奴役、饥饿、贫穷的根源，把斗争坚持到底。连西方有的通讯社也承认：南朝鲜人民的反抗斗争“将不可避免地不断发生，也会发生更多的镇压，直到这个政权最后被推翻为止。这也许需要两个星期或者两年，但是这终究是不能避免的。”在土耳其或美国控制的其他地方，美国也可能采取更加狡猾的欺骗手段来缓和人民的反抗，但是，可以肯定，这种企图同样也是不能得逞的。帝国主义和反动派是人民的反面教员，人民群众会从斗争中得到锻炼，受到教育，学会如何战胜敌人。敌人越反动，就越能激发人民的革命性，敌人也就更加濒于死亡。不管镇压也好，欺骗也好，都不能挽救反动统治最后必然灭亡的命运。
    在美帝国主义加紧对各国人民进行欺骗的时候，现代修正主义者可耻地担当了帮凶的角色，现代修正主义者宣扬压迫者和被压迫者、帝国主义和殖民地半殖民地人民之间的“和平合作”。在他们的描绘下，帝国主义的本性似乎已经起了变化，好像帝国主义已经放弃了暴力和侵略、扩张政策，变得很和平了。他们的这套鬼话在现实生活面前显得多么可笑。当南朝鲜和土耳其密布着美国的军事基地，美国占领军在那里蹂躏人民的时候，当那里的人民受着残酷的掠夺、饥寒交迫、走投无路的时候，当那里的人民被剥夺了一切权利，成千成万地被投入牢狱和被奢杀的时候，他们能相信帝国主义的本性已经改变，相信反动派不再是反动派吗？南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民起来斗争的事实本身，就有力地驳斥了现代修正主义关于压迫者和被压迫者“和平合作”的谬论。南朝鲜人民本来想用和平的示威来达到他们的目的，但是统治者却用坦克、大炮、机关枪和刺刀来对付他们。当示威的群众惨遭奢杀，他们的鲜血洒遍汉城和其他城市的街道的时候，他们能相信说什么帝国主义和它的走狗会放弃暴力那套骗人的鬼话吗？现在，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动空前高涨，许多地方的人民展开了反对帝国主义及其走狗的武装游击斗争，阿尔及利亚人民坚持和胜利开展着民族解放战争，这一切事实都无情的戳穿了现代修正主义的欺骗，证明了现代修正主义的破产。
    南朝鲜人民反对美李法西斯统治的斗争已经获得第一步胜利，土耳其人民反对曼德列斯卖国独裁政府的斗争方兴未艾。南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民要彻底实现他们的目标，还须经历艰巨、复杂、曲折的斗争过程。美帝国主义和它在南朝鲜、土耳其的走狗，必然还会千方百计地镇压人民的反抗。但是，南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民的爱国正义斗争有着全世界人民的支持，只要南朝鲜、土耳其的人民团结一致，把斗争坚持到底，就一定能够达到自己的目标。
    古巴革命的胜利，是一个光辉的榜样。古巴是一个只有六百五十万人的国家，孤悬在加勒比海中，最凶恶的帝国主义——美国近在咫尺。古巴人民在革命过程中所面临的敌人，就是这个最凶恶的帝国主义和它所豢养的武装到牙齿的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权。巴蒂斯塔对古巴人民实行恐怖统治，在他执政期间，惨遭杀戮的革命者达两万人。由于古巴人民紧密团结，长期坚持斗争，并经过两年游击战争，终于推翻了卖国独裁政权，取得了民族民主革命的胜利。古巴革命胜利后，美国不甘心自己的失败，千方百计地对古巴进行破坏和策划颠覆活动，不但施加经济压力和外交压力，实行威胁、恐吓，而且派飞机轰炸，制造爆炸事件，训练叛乱分子准备进攻。英雄的古巴人民没有被吓倒，他们保卫革命和推进革命的决心愈来愈坚强。他们摧毁旧的国家机器，坚决镇压反革命，实行土地改革。他们勇敢地回击美国的干涉，维护民族独立。为了有力地打击国内外敌人的破坏活动，他们普遍实行了军事训练，组织了民兵。古巴人民的英勇斗争，大大鼓舞了拉丁美洲人民和世界各国人民，沉重地打击了美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。古巴人民的斗争表明，被压迫的人民一旦觉醒起来，行动起来，为争取自己的解放而坚持斗争，他们就会由弱者变为强者，表现出无比强大的力量，而帝国主义和它的走狗就会由强者变为弱者，显出纸老虎的原形。古巴人民能够做到的，南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民和其他一切被压迫的人民也一定能够做到。
    以美国为首的帝国主义是全世界人民的共同敌人。帝国主义不仅剥削、压迫本国人民，而且奴役和掠夺其他国家的人民。美帝国主义是当代最凶恶最富侵略性的帝国主义。美国统治集团疯狂地扩军备战，组织侵略性的军事集团，大力扶植日本和西德的军国主义复活，蛮横地干涉和镇压各国人民的革命运动，反对一切进步和正义的事业，对社会主义各国进行破坏、颠覆、军事包围以至战争挑衅，严重地威胁和破坏世界和平。资本主义各国无产阶级要获得解放，殖民地半殖民地人民要取得民族独立，全世界人民要维护世界和平，要取得一切进步和正义的事业的胜利，就必须和帝国主义首先是美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争。各国人民在反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中，需要互相团结互相支持。只有把社会主义各国人民的斗争、殖民地半殖民地人民的民族解放斗争、资本主义各国无产阶级的革命斗争、各国人民争取和平的斗争结合在一起，才能打败帝国主义及其走狗，取得世界的持久和平。毛泽东同志指出：
  “帝国主义的寿命不会很长了，他们做尽了坏事，全世界一切受压迫的人民决不会饶恕他们。”“为了战胜帝国主义的反动统治，必须结成广泛的统一战线，必须团结不包括敌人在内的一切可以团结的力量，继续进行艰巨的斗争。”解放了的中国人民，一贯把坚决支持各国人民的正义斗争，作为自己的崇高的国际主义责任。中国人民永远不会忘记世界各国人民对自己的支持，也永远不会忘记用自己的努力去支持各国人民的斗争。我们不论什么时候都坚决站在各国人民这一边，反对帝国主义。我们相信，只要全世界人民团结起来，坚持斗争，就一定能够打败帝国主义和他们的一切走狗，取得最后的胜利。（原载“红旗”1960年第10期）
