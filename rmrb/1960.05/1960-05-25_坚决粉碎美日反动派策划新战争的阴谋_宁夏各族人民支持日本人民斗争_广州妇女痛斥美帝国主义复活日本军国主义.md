Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, May 24th: People of all ethnic groups in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region continue to carry out various activities, resolutely supporting the Japanese people in opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's use of violence to illegally "pass" the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

In recent days, democratic parties, people's organizations, industrial and commercial circles, religious circles, and people from all walks of life in the autonomous region and Yinchuan City have held successive symposiums, strongly condemning U.S. imperialism for fostering the revival of Japanese militarism, opposing the conspiracy of U.S.-Japan reactionaries to plan a new war, and resolutely supporting the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S. and for patriotism. Yuan Jinzhang, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang in the Autonomous Region, published an article entitled "Supporting the Struggle of the Oppressed People is Our Responsibility." The article stated: U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, and the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique is a running dog of U.S. imperialism. It relies on the bayonets of U.S. imperialism to sell out national interests and bring endless disasters to the Japanese people. The Japanese people's anti-U.S. and patriotic struggle has won the sympathy and support of the people of the world. Supporting the Japanese people is our lofty and sacred internationalist responsibility. We resolutely stand with the Japanese people until the Japanese people's just struggle achieves final victory.

Representatives attending the Representative Meeting of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education in the Autonomous Region were extremely angry at the actions of U.S. imperialism in colluding with the Japanese reactionary clique to sign the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. They expressed their determination to stand firmly with the Japanese people and smash the new aggressive conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

More and more workers, farmers, students, and cadres in other counties and cities of the autonomous region have written to newspapers and radio stations, and held rallies, expressing their firm support for the Japanese people's just struggle to demand the dissolution of the Diet and the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and to overthrow the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," until the Japanese people achieve final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 24th: The broad masses of women in Guangzhou, who have suffered the cruel invasion of Japanese militarism, expressed their firm support for the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The women of Guangzhou have vivid memories of the heinous crimes committed by Japanese imperialists during their invasion of China more than 20 years ago. In the three days of June 4, 5, and 6, 1938 alone, more than 7,000 Guangzhou residents were killed or injured in the Japanese militarists' "major bombing." Many women lost their children and husbands as a result. Shi Er, an 80-year-old woman living on the water, lost her daughter and two granddaughters in the bombing by Japanese militarists. She witnessed the scene of Japanese invaders' planes fiercely strafing and bombing residents on the Pearl River. Today, when she recalls this tragic past, she gritted her teeth and said: "Japanese invaders are our mortal enemies. We will never allow U.S. imperialism to foster the revival of Japanese militarism. We must support the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty until victory." Many women in Guangzhou have tragic experiences like that of Shi Er. Zhao Bixia, the director of the Lingnan Street Sewing Factory, was forced to sell her son during the fall of Guangzhou. Her husband became seriously ill after being injured by the Japanese invaders, and has not yet recovered. She herself suffered a nervous breakdown due to excessive stimulation. She said: "If U.S. imperialism wants to revive Japanese militarism, we will fight it resolutely to the end!" Huang Yanhua, director of the Ninth Residents' Committee of Datang Street, like many women in Guangzhou, suffered the pain of separation from her loved ones under the persecution of Japanese militarism. During the Japanese imperialist invasion of China, five of her children starved to death, and four children were given away because she could not afford to raise them. She said: "The Chinese people will never allow U.S. imperialism to foster Japanese militarism to harm the people. We must use our greatest strength to defend peace, and the tragic history of the past must never be allowed to repeat itself!" (Attached picture)

    Old Mrs. Zhu Yanying, 55 years old from Hefei City, had her left leg blown off by a Japanese plane in 1938. This is her sitting on a cart participating in Hefei City's demonstration in support of the Japanese people's just struggle. She angrily shouted: Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism! Resolutely overthrow U.S. imperialism!

    新华社银川24日电　宁夏回族自治区各族各界人民继续展开各种活动，坚决支持日本人民反对岸信介政府使用暴力非法“通过”日美军事同盟条约。
    自治区和银川市各民主党派、各人民团体和工商界、宗教界及社会人士，近日来连续举行座谈会，强烈谴责美帝国主义扶植日本军国主义复活，反对美日反动派策划新战争的阴谋，坚决支持日本人民反美爱国的正义斗争。民革自治区委员会主任委员袁金章，发表了题为“支持被压迫人民的斗争是我们的责任”的文章。文章说：美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，岸信介反动集团是美帝国主义的走狗，它依靠美帝国主义的刺刀出卖民族利益，给日本人民带来了无穷的灾难。日本人民的反美爱国斗争，得到全世界人民的同情和支持。支持日本人民，是我们崇高神圣的国际主义责任，我们坚决和日本人民站在一起，直到日本人民的正义斗争取得最后胜利为止。
    出席自治区文化教育先进工作者代表会的代表，对美帝国主义勾结日本反动集团签订日美军事同盟条约的行动，异常愤怒。他们表示要坚决和日本人民站在一起，粉碎美日反动派新的侵略阴谋。
    自治区其他各县、市愈来愈多的工人、农民、学生和干部，纷纷给报纸、广播电台写稿，并举行集会，表示坚决支持日本人民要求解散国会和要求岸信介内阁下台，推翻日美“安全条约”的正义斗争，直到日本人民取得最后胜利时为止。
    新华社广州24日电　曾经遭受过日本军国主义残酷侵略的广州市广大妇女，表示坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。
    广州市妇女对二十多年以前日本帝国主义者在侵略中国期间所犯下的滔天罪行，记忆犹新。仅1938年6月4日、5日、6日三天中，广州市居民在日本军国主义“大轰炸”下，就死伤了七千多人。许多妇女因此而失掉了儿女和丈夫。八十岁的水上居民石二老大娘的女儿和两个孙女就是在日本军国主义者的轰炸下牺牲的。她目击了日本侵略者的飞机在珠江河面上向水上居民猛烈扫射和轰炸时的情景。今天，当她回忆起这个悲惨的往事时，她咬牙切齿地说：“日本侵略者是我们的死敌，我们决不容许美帝国主义扶植日本军国主义卷土重来，我们一定要支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，直到胜利为止。”广州市许多妇女都有像石二老大娘一样悲惨的经历。岭南街缝纫厂厂长赵碧霞的儿子就是在广州沦陷期间被迫卖掉的，她的丈夫被日寇打伤后得了重病，直到现在还没有复原。她自己也曾因受刺激过度以致神经失常。她说：“美帝国主义要复活日本军国主义，我们就要和它坚决斗争到底！”大塘街第九居民委员会主任黄燕华和许多广州妇女一样，在日本军国主义的迫害下饱尝了骨肉分离的痛苦。在日本帝国主义侵华期间，她的五个孩子饿死了，四个孩子因无法养活送给了人家。她说：“中国人民坚决不让美帝国主义扶植日本军国主义残害人民，我们一定要用最大的力量来保卫和平，过去的悲惨历史决不能让它重演！”（附图片）
