Local Newspaper Commentary:

    The work of comprehensively utilizing material resources, after the experiments and research of the past two years, has yielded considerable experience in various regions, and a number of factories for comprehensive utilization and diversified operations have been established. The current issue lies in the widespread promotion of existing experience, transforming experiments into production, and transforming the small-scale efforts of a few units into large-scale efforts in all sectors, vigorously launching a mass movement to vigorously promote comprehensive utilization and develop diversified operations. The practice of Nantong Prefecture, which organized more than 250 factories and mobilized rural people's communes and urban street residents to vigorously promote comprehensive utilization, is worth promoting. Only by mobilizing forces from all sides can the abundant resources distributed in the vast urban and rural areas be utilized to the greatest extent and at the fastest speed. Currently, some places emphasize that comprehensive utilization is a highly technical work that can only be experimented with by a few people, and they are afraid to let go and mobilize the masses to engage in it on a large scale. Comprehensive utilization is indeed highly technical, and experimentation and research are indispensable. However, should we only have a few people locked in laboratories to conduct experiments, or should we mobilize the broad masses to conduct experiments? Only the latter approach is correct and can lead to the discovery of more avenues for comprehensive utilization as quickly as possible.
    How to start vigorously promoting comprehensive utilization? According to the experience of various regions, we should adhere to the principle of "relying on the mountains to eat the mountains, relying on the water to eat the water," taking materials locally and utilizing them locally. Comprehensive utilization is inherently linked to the development of local resources. Therefore, all regions must look downward and fully and rationally utilize their own resources. Utilize whatever resources you have, and utilize as much of the resources as you have. (Excerpt from Xinhua Daily)

    大搞综合利用发展多种经营
    综合利用物质资源的工作，经过前两年的试验、研究，各地都已取得不少经验，而且建立了一批综合利用、多种经营的工厂。当前的问题，就在于普遍地推广已有的经验，变试验为生产，变少数单位的小搞为各行各业的大搞，大张旗鼓地掀起一个大搞综合利用发展多种经营的群众运动。南通专区组织了两百五十多家工厂，发动了农村人民公社、城市街道居民，都来大搞综合利用的做法，是值得提倡的。只有把各方面的力量都动员起来，才能以最快的速度，把分布在广大城乡的丰富资源最大限度地利用起来。现在有些地方，强调综合利用是技术性较强的工作，只能由少数人搞试验，不敢放手发动群众大搞。综合利用技术性是比较强的，试验、研究也是不可缺少的，然而，是只由少数人关在试验室里搞试验呢，还是发动广大群众搞试验呢？只有后一种做法才是正确的，才能尽快地发现更多的综合利用的门路。
    大搞综合利用从何着手？根据各地经验，应当本着“靠山吃山、靠水吃水”的原则，就地取材，就地利用。综合利用本来就是和开发地方资源联系在一起的，因此各地一定要眼睛向下，把自己的资源充分地、合理地利用起来，有什么资源就利用什么资源，有多少资源就利用多少资源。　（摘自新华日报）
