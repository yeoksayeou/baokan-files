Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch from Moscow via TASS: On the 15th, at 22:00 Moscow time (03:00 Beijing time on the 16th), the Soviet satellite spaceship completed its fourteenth orbit around the Earth. Ground recording stations are continuously receiving working data from the experimental instruments installed on the satellite. Receiving centers are constantly receiving signals from the spaceship's transmitter. The telemetry data received indicates that the instruments on the satellite spaceship are functioning normally. Reliable sealing and temperature control equipment ensure normal living conditions for the detachment cabin. Electronic computers have processed the accumulated observations of the satellite spaceship's operation, proving that its actual orbit is highly consistent with calculations. The orbit of the satellite spaceship is nearly circular, with a perigee altitude of 312 kilometers and an apogee of 369 kilometers. The orbital period is 91.2 minutes. The adjustment calculation center is continuously receiving materials from countries around the world regarding the reception of signals from the "signal" transmitter.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th. TASS reports that the Astronomical Observatory of the Academy of Sciences of the Uzbek Republic has obtained photographs of the trajectory of the Soviet spacecraft.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, reports that the Soviet spacecraft was first seen in Bucharest at 03:54 local time on the morning of the 16th.

This newspaper's comprehensive report, according to Xinhua News Agency: Observation stations in the United States, Britain, and Japan have received signals from the Soviet spacecraft transmitter.

The satellite spaceship passed over New York around the morning of the 15th, New York time. An observation station of a radio company in eastern Long Island received its signals, which lasted for six minutes. The Fort Monmouth radio observation station in New Jersey, USA, also received radio signals from the satellite spaceship. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in the United States announced on the 15th that a rural (Colorado) observation station of the observatory visually observed the Soviet satellite spaceship on the morning of the 15th.

The BBC in Tatsfield, Surrey, England, also received signals from the Soviet spacecraft on the 15th.

Tokyo, Japan, also received signals from the satellite spaceship on the afternoon of the 15th and the early morning of the 16th.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th: The Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has issued forecasts for the Soviet satellite spaceship and its carrier rocket passing over various parts of China in the coming days:

On the 18th of this month, the satellite spaceship will pass over Qingdao, Yantai, Lushun-Dalian, Anshan, Fushun, Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Jiamusi, and other places between 02:55 and 02:58 in the early morning, and will appear over Tianjin, Beijing, Ulanhot, eastern Qiqihar, and other places.

At 04:27 in the early morning of the 18th, it will pass over the western part of Xining.

On the 19th, the satellite spaceship will pass over Datong, Jining, Hohhot, Xilinhot, Hailar, and other places between 03:14 and 03:19 in the early morning, and will appear in the western parts of Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Ulanhot, Qiqihar, and the eastern part of Manzhouli. At 04:48 in the early morning, it will pass over the eastern part of Urumqi.

On the 20th, it will pass over the eastern part of Northeast China, but it will not be easy to see.

On the 21st of this month, the satellite spaceship will pass over Chengde, Ulanhot, Qiqihar, and other places between 02:23 and 02:25 in the early morning, the western parts of Jinzhou, Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Jiamusi, and the eastern part of Hailar.

The spaceship's carrier rocket will appear near the spaceship in the coming days. At the aforementioned times and locations, if the weather is clear, it can be seen with the naked eye.

    红色飞船频传喜讯
    苏联摄得飞船照片　许多国家收到讯号
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：15日莫斯科时间二十二时（北京时间16日三时），苏联卫星式飞船围绕地球运行十四周。地面纪录站正在不断地收到安装在卫星上的实验仪器的工作数据。各接收中心不断收到飞船发射机发回来的讯号。所收到的遥测数据表明：卫星式飞船仪器工作正常。可靠的密封状况和温度调节装备，保证了脱离舱正常的生活条件。电子计算机就已积累到的卫星式飞船运行情况观察结果作了整理，证明了它的实际轨道同计算是十分一致的。卫星式飞船的轨道接近圆形，近地点高度是三百一十二公里，远地点是三百六十九公里。运行周期为九十一点二分钟。调整计算中心不断收到世界各国送来的接收“信号”发射机讯号的材料。
    新华社莫斯科16日电　据塔斯社报道，乌兹别克共和国科学院天文台已经获得了苏联宇宙飞船的行踪照片。
    据新华社布加勒斯特电　16日早晨当地时间三时五十四分，在布加勒斯特第一次看到了苏联宇宙飞船。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国、英国、日本的一些观测站已收到了苏联宇宙飞船发射机发出的讯号。
