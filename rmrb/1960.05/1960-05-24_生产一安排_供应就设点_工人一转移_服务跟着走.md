Production is Arranged, Supply Points are Set Up
Workers are Transferred, Services Follow

    The Karamay Oilfield in Xinjiang has many types of work, a vast area, and very dispersed oil wells. To produce more oil, the main production workers work in three shifts day and night. The workers are unwilling to waste time going to the city to buy things. In order to adapt to this situation and support oil production in the mining area, the Karamay City commercial department not only opened night shops but also provided mobile supplies to construction sites and workshops. They have achieved the goal of setting up supply points wherever production is arranged and transferring supplies whenever production is transferred.
    In order to supply the living needs of oil-winning warriors in many ways, the mobile teams of the commercial department deliver all kinds of non-staple foods to the wells for supply, so that workers can eat high-quality and varied foods even in the severe winter. Most of the workers in Karamay work in the wild Gobi Desert, and the working and living conditions are quite difficult. In the distribution of materials, the store adheres to the principle of "guaranteeing key areas, taking care of special needs, and arranging general needs," trying to ensure that commodities are used where they are most needed and that the distribution of materials is fair and reasonable. The enthusiasm of commercial workers in serving production has been welcomed by the majority of employees. The commercial departments of the mining area often receive letters of thanks from the oil-winning front lines.

    生产一安排　供应就设点
    工人一转移　服务跟着走
    新疆克拉玛依油矿工种繁多，地区辽阔，矿井又非常分散。为了多产油，主要生产工人都是日夜三班。工人们都不愿意耽误时间到市区买东西。克拉玛依市商业部门为了适应这种情况，支援矿区石油生产，不但开办了夜间商店，还到工地、车间流动供应。做到了生产一安排，供应就设点；生产一转移，供应就转移。
    为了多方面供应夺油战士的生活需要，商业部门的流动组把各式各样的副食品送到井边供应，工人们即使在严寒的冬季也能吃到质量好、花样多的食品。克拉玛依的大部分工人在野外戈壁滩上工作，工作和生活条件相当艰苦。在物资分配上，商店本着“保证重点，照顾特殊，安排一般”的原则，尽量使商品用在最需要的地方，使物资分配公平合理。商业工作者为生产服务的热情，受到了广大职工的欢迎。矿区的商业部门经常收到从夺油前线给他们寄来的感谢信。
