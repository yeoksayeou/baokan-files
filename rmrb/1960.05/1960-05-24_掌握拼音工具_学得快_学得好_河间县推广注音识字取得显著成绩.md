Mastering the Pinyin Tool for Faster and Better Learning
Hejian County Achieves Remarkable Results in Promoting Phonetic Literacy

    (Our report) Hejian County, Hebei Province, has achieved remarkable results in promoting phonetic literacy. Through vigorously promoting Hanyu Pinyin and running numerous spare-time elementary schools, the county has enrolled over 115,000 young and middle-aged people, accounting for 97% of the total number eligible for enrollment. Because the workers and peasants have mastered the pinyin tool, the results of illiteracy elimination have been consolidated, and the number of non-illiterates has rapidly increased to 89%.

    In this county, using Hanyu Pinyin for illiteracy elimination, in just two months, more than 3,800 people out of over 44,000 illiterate individuals have been freed from illiteracy. Generally, it only takes a dozen hours to master the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet relatively proficiently, and thirty-five to thirty-eight hours to complete the "Phonetic Literacy Vocabulary List," recognizing 1,500 new characters. With an additional fourteen hours or so for review, consolidation, reading, and writing, they can meet the standards for graduation from illiteracy elimination programs. At the same time, the results of illiteracy elimination can be consolidated, and the number of characters recognized can be expanded. Many people, after mastering the pinyin alphabet, can teach themselves while reading many phonetic popular reading materials, and those who cannot write can temporarily use pinyin letters instead. Some farmers have read dozens of popular reading materials, and some have even bought phonetic versions of "On Contradiction" and "On Practice," sparking a wave of learning Chairman Mao's works. According to statistics, since October of last year, more than 70,000 copies of phonetic reading materials have been sold throughout the county. The reading materials are already in short supply, and as soon as new books arrive, the masses rush to buy and read them. The broad masses are very happy because, with the help of pinyin letters, they can quickly learn political, technical, and cultural knowledge. In Dacao Lu Village, an old woman and a mother of four learned the pinyin alphabet in seven days and recognized 1,500 characters in a month, enabling them to read phonetic reading materials and write simple letters. Some people wrote poems praising: "Phonetic literacy method is ingenious, learn five hundred and three in two days, shed the illiteracy hat in one month, and have no difficulty reading books and newspapers." The Hanyu Pinyin alphabet has become a convenient tool for the masses in production and life. People widely use Hanyu Pinyin letters to write big-character posters, challenge letters, good news reports, Spring Festival couplets, and so on. In promoting Hanyu Pinyin, the county first strengthened the Party's leadership over the phonetic literacy movement. The Party committees at all levels were led by a secretary who personally took charge and conducted thorough ideological mobilization. To unify the understanding of cadres and the masses, the county party committee adopted the methods of "seeing" and "debating," organizing on-site visits on the one hand and organizing discussions on the other, to enlighten everyone's in-depth understanding of this new thing of Hanyu Pinyin. These activities rapidly promoted the development of the phonetic literacy movement in the county, enabling more than 110,000 young and middle-aged people to persist in learning. When carrying out this work, the Party committees at all levels also closely integrated with production and made comprehensive and unified arrangements, implementing the principle of "learn more when not busy, learn less when busy, learn flexibly when very busy, persist regularly, and do not interrupt," so that students can use all available gaps to study independently anytime and anywhere, quickly master the pinyin tool, and read relevant production technology phonetic reading materials, so as to drive learning with production and promote production with learning. At the same time, a large number of backbone teachers were also trained in a planned way. In the past six months, the number of non-governmental school teachers in the county has increased from the original 1,600 to more than 4,300, with an average of one teacher for every twenty students. The 108 non-governmental school teacher pinyin teaching research stations and the pinyin teaching research groups in each village further helped the non-governmental school teachers to conduct research and exchange experiences. Through timely summing up experience and improving teaching methods, the teaching level has been continuously improved, and the results of illiteracy elimination have become more consolidated.
