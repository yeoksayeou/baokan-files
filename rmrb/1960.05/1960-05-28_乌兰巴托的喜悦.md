Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, with a population of over 150,000, today saw 80,000 citizens lining the streets to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and all the Chinese guests.

The Mongolian weather also seemed to be welcoming the distinguished Chinese guests. A few days ago, Ulaanbaatar had experienced some light showers, making the newly laid lawns alongside the streets even greener and more lovely. The trees lining the sidewalks also sprouted tender green leaves. Today, the weather was clear and the air particularly fresh and pleasant. Citizens, young and old, dressed in their festive best, arrived early to line the streets of the city, waiting to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai. Among the welcoming crowds were factory workers, government employees, students, elderly people nearing their twilight years, and lively, adorable children. Even nomadic herders living on the grasslands near the city had come. Chinese workers who were assisting in Mongolia's construction, along with representatives of overseas Chinese, joined the Mongolian people in joyfully awaiting the arrival of Premier Zhou. Cars and trucks filled with welcoming crowds sped along the road leading to the airport.

Mongolian Party and state leaders Tsedenbal, Sambuu, Tsende, and others arrived at the airport around ten o'clock.

Premier Zhou Enlai's special plane landed in Ulaanbaatar at 11:25 a.m. Chairman Tsedenbal and others walked to the front of the plane to greet him, shaking hands warmly with the visiting Chinese dignitaries and exchanging greetings. The welcoming crowd gathered at the airport erupted in enthusiastic cheers.

Subsequently, Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Chairman Tsedenbal, left the airport by car and headed towards the city center. Today, Ulaanbaatar was adorned everywhere with flags and colorful decorations, grandly welcoming the distinguished Chinese guests. The welcoming masses lined the wide streets, forming a sea of people. The cars arrived in front of the "Gate of Peace," on which hung a pale blue Khata with a golden bowl placed on top. According to Mongolian tradition, this signifies welcoming the most honored guests. The cars crossed the bridge over the Tuul River, which was only built last year. Huge banners were hung across both ends of the bridge, reading "Welcome Distinguished Guests" in both Chinese and Mongolian.

When Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Tsedenbal's convertible arrived at the "Gate of Friendship," the welcoming crowds, holding red flags or bouquets, erupted in excitement, cheering and saluting the Chinese dignitaries.

At the entrance of the Industrial Combine Factory, a group of young women wearing beautiful national costumes ran out of the welcoming crowd and placed large wreaths on the cars, expressing their respect to the distinguished guests. At the moment the car stopped, Sandek-Ochir, a worker from the woolen textile factory, Buunkhag, an old guerrilla fighter, and Nymbu, a citizen, presented Premier Zhou Enlai with a Khata and a silver bowl filled with dairy products. The elderly Nymbu, deeply moved, repeatedly said to Premier Zhou, "Salute to you!" Premier Zhou Enlai warmly shook his hand and said, "Thank you."

The "Peace Bridge" is a bridge built with the assistance of the Chinese people, symbolizing the fraternal friendship between the two countries. The national flags of China and Mongolia, hanging on the lampposts on the bridge, fluttered in the wind. Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Tsedenbal's convertible drove onto the bridge, where they looked out over the flourishing and developing city of Ulaanbaatar.

As the cars carrying the Chinese guests entered the main streets of the city, the welcoming crowds grew even larger. They waved the national flags of China and Mongolia and bouquets, continuously chanting "Long Live Mongolian-Chinese Friendship!" "Welcome Premier Zhou Enlai!"

As they approached the guesthouse, in front of the huge banner that read, "Extending heartfelt respect to the great and heroic Chinese people who are building socialism at the speed of the Great Leap Forward," people surged forward again to salute Premier Zhou Enlai by scattering colored paper confetti. At this time, several cars sped by. The people sitting in the cars had just welcomed Premier Zhou at the head of the "Peace Bridge" and now, they had rushed back to welcome the Chinese guests once again.

Chairman Tsedenbal accompanied Premier Zhou Enlai all the way to the tree-lined guesthouse, where Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Premier Zhou's entourage would be staying.

Today, Mongolian newspapers have devoted considerable space to publishing editorials, special articles, and poems to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai. "Unen" and "Youth Unen" printed eye-catching Chinese headlines: "May the Friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese Peoples Last Forever!" "Warmly Welcome Our Distinguished Guest, Comrade Zhou Enlai!" In its editorial entitled "A Visit of Brotherly Friendship," the Mongolian newspaper "Unen" said: "Premier Zhou Enlai's visit will make a great contribution to consolidating the traditional friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples, and will also make an important contribution to developing and consolidating the fraternal friendship and cooperation among the peoples of the powerful socialist camp."

This enthusiastic and grand welcome is a vivid demonstration of the deep friendship between China and Mongolia. Let us conclude by recording a poem entitled "Welcome You" written by the famous Mongolian poet Rentsen:

　　With a summer-like warm and benevolent heart,
　　Six hundred and fifty million brothers!
　　We are not friends made only this evening,
　　We are eternal brothers. ......

This famous poet, with sincere emotion, expressed the joy of the people of Ulaanbaatar, and also expressed the joy of all the Mongolian people!

    乌兰巴托的喜悦
    新华社记者　于民生　彭逢烨
    有着十五万多市民的蒙古人民共和国的首都乌兰巴托，今天有八万人夹道欢迎周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和全体中国客人。
    蒙古的天气也好像在欢迎中国贵宾，前两天，乌兰巴托下过几阵小雨，街道旁新铺设的草地更加绿得可爱，人行道两旁的树木也吐出了嫩绿的枝叶。今天，天气晴朗，空气特别清新宜人。市民们扶老携幼，一早就穿着节日的新装，到市区马路两旁，等待着欢迎周恩来总理。在欢迎的人群里，有工厂职工、机关干部和学生，有年近古稀的老人和活泼可爱的儿童，连住在市区附近草原上的牧民们也赶来了。帮助蒙古建设的中国员工们、华侨代表们和蒙古人民一道，兴高彩烈地迎候着周总理的来临。满载着欢迎人群的大小汽车在通往飞机场的马路上奔驰。
    蒙古党和国家领导人泽登巴尔、桑布、曾德等人，十点多钟就来到了机场。
    周恩来总理的专机十一点二十五分在乌兰巴托着陆。泽登巴尔主席等走到飞机前面迎接，他们同来访的中国贵宾亲切地握手问好。聚集在飞机场上的欢迎人群，发出了热情的欢呼。
    接着，周恩来总理在泽登巴尔主席陪同下坐汽车离开机场向市区进发。今天的乌兰巴托市到处悬旗结彩，万紫千红，盛装迎接中国贵宾。宽阔的马路两旁欢迎的群众人山人海。汽车来到了“和平门”前，“和平门”上悬挂着一幅淡蓝色的哈达，上面放着一个金色碗，按照蒙古民族的传统习惯，这是表示迎接最高贵的客人的。汽车经过横跨土拉河的大桥，大桥是去年才建成的。桥两头横挂着巨幅标语，分别用中蒙文写着“欢迎贵宾”。
    当周恩来总理和泽登巴尔主席乘坐的敞篷汽车来到了“友谊门”时，高举红旗或手拿花束的夹道欢迎的人群沸腾起来了，他们向中国贵宾欢呼致敬。
    在工业联合工厂门口，欢迎队伍里跑出一群穿着漂亮的民族服装的女青年，她们把一个个大花环放在汽车上，表示向贵宾致敬。在汽车停下的这一瞬间，毛纺织厂工人桑德克—奥奇尔、老游击队员布恩卡格和市民尼姆布向周恩来总理献哈达和用银碗盛装的奶食品。老人尼姆布激动得连连向周总理说：“向您致敬！”周恩来总理和他热烈握手，并且说：“谢谢你”。
    “和平桥”是中国人民帮助蒙古建设的、象征两国兄弟友谊之桥，桥上灯柱上挂着的中蒙两国国旗，迎风招展。周恩来总理和泽登巴尔主席乘坐的敞篷汽车驶上这座桥，他们眺望正在繁荣发展的乌兰巴托市的景色。
    当中国客人乘坐的汽车进入市区的主要街道时，欢迎的群众也越来越多，他们挥舞着中蒙两国国旗和花束，连续不断地欢呼“蒙中友谊万岁！”“欢迎周恩来总理！”
    快到迎宾馆了，在“向以大跃进速度建设社会主义的伟大的英雄中国人民致以衷心的敬礼”的巨幅横布标语前面，人们又涌上前去，向周恩来总理撒彩色纸片致敬。这时有几辆汽车奔驰而来，坐在汽车上的人们，刚才曾在“和平桥”头欢迎过周总理，现在，他们又再次赶来欢迎中国客人。
    泽登巴尔主席一直陪送周恩来总理到绿树成荫的迎宾馆，周总理、陈毅副总理和周总理的随行人员就住在这里。
    今天，蒙古报纸都用大量篇幅发表社论、专文和诗歌，欢迎周恩来总理。“真理报”、“青年真理报”刊印着醒目的中文大字标题：“蒙中人民友谊万古长青！”“热烈地欢迎我们的贵宾周恩来同志！”蒙古“真理报”在以“兄弟友谊的访问”为题的社论中说：“周恩来总理的这次访问，将为巩固蒙中两国人民的传统友谊作出巨大贡献，并且为发展和巩固强大的社会主义阵营人民的兄弟友谊和合作，作出重要贡献。”
    这次热烈而又盛大的欢迎，正是中蒙两国深厚友谊的生动证明。最后让我们记下一位蒙古著名诗人拉姆苏伦写的一首“欢迎你”的诗吧！
    怀着夏日般的温暖而慈善的心，
    六亿五千万兄弟们！
    我们并非是今夕结交的朋友，
    我们是永恒的弟兄。…………
    这位著名诗人以真挚的感情，表达了乌兰巴托人民的喜悦，也表达了全体蒙古人民的喜悦！
