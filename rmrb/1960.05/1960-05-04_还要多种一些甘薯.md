Plant More Sweet Potatoes

The spring sweet potato planting season has begun. This year, many places have broken with the old lunar calendar saying of "Plant sweet potato seeds around the Qingming Festival in March, and plant sweet potato seedlings around the Dragon Boat Festival in May," starting both seedling cultivation and planting one or two solar terms earlier than in previous years. This has prepared a good foundation for planting sweet potatoes early, abundantly, quickly, and well, and striving for a bumper sweet potato harvest this year.

Planting more high-yield crops is a reliable way to rapidly increase grain production. The sweet potato is the king of high-yield grain crops. Past experience has proven that wherever more sweet potatoes are planted, the faster the grain growth rate will be. In the ten years from 1949 to 1959, the sown area of grain crops nationwide expanded by about 20%, while the planting area of sweet potatoes more than doubled; the total output of grain nationwide increased by more than double, while the total output of sweet potatoes increased fourfold. The average yield per unit area of sweet potatoes is more than 30% higher than the national average yield of grain crops, making it the highest-yielding crop among all grain crops. Therefore, according to the unified arrangements for agricultural production, appropriately developing the production of tubers (mainly sweet potatoes) plays a significant role in accelerating the development of China's grain production. In densely populated and low-yield areas, planting more sweet potatoes is even more important. Hebei Province, which has historically been short of grain, has achieved basic self-sufficiency in grain since last year. One of the most important experiences has been planting more sweet potatoes and other high-yield crops. The tenth article of the National Agricultural Development Program adopted by the National People's Congress this year also clearly stipulates: "According to needs and dietary habits, appropriately develop high-yield crops such as corn and tubers." This shows that it is an important measure to realize the great leap forward in grain production.

Sweet potatoes are a staple food loved by the vast urban and rural residents, and in many areas, tubers are used as the main food source. Some people believe that after the establishment of public canteens, people can eat less or not eat sweet potatoes, and can plant less or even not plant tubers. This view is one-sided. The broad masses of the people do not change their habit of liking sweet potatoes simply because they participate in public canteens. In fact, urban and rural residents who participate in public canteens demand even more sweet potatoes to make their meals richer and more diverse. Tuber crops are also good concentrated feed and important industrial raw materials. The development of animal husbandry, especially pig raising, also requires planting more sweet potatoes, using their leaves, vines, and tubers as feed. Commune-run industries and state industries alike also require planting more sweet potatoes because sweet potatoes can be comprehensively utilized to make many products that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. In order to improve people's lives, to meet the needs of the great development of animal husbandry, to provide more raw materials for the food industry and the chemical industry, in a word, to realize a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward in agricultural production, and to promote the faster development of the entire national economy, all localities should plant as many tuber crops as possible.

Planting more sweet potatoes does not mean squeezing out or reducing the planting area of other crops. China is a country with very abundant agricultural products, and the country's economic construction and people's lives have diverse requirements for agricultural products. The planting area of grain crops needs to be expanded, and the area of cash crops such as cotton, oilseeds, tobacco, and sugar also needs to have a certain development. All regions should, according to the state's plans, and according to local needs and conditions, from the province and county to the commune and team, implement the planting area of sweet potatoes level by level, ensuring that the planned sweet potatoes are planted and planted well. At the same time, it is necessary to vigorously explore the potential for land utilization and strive to plant more sweet potatoes without affecting the planting area of various crops. Planting more also means harvesting more. Tubers are high-yield crops, and their potential for increasing production is still very large. There is much to be done to increase yield per unit area. Since the great leap forward in 1958 and 1959, many areas have seen large-scale high-yield records of sweet potato yields exceeding 10,000 catties per mu. In Xichong County, Sichuan Province, 230,000 mu of sweet potatoes averaged 6,278 catties per mu last year (more than twice the national average yield of sweet potatoes), of which 80,000 mu of high-yield fields yielded more than 10,000 catties per mu. If the national sweet potato yield can be increased to the level of Xichong County, the total output of sweet potatoes in China can be increased by one or two times, reaching about 300 billion catties (converted to grain). It can be seen that striving for high sweet potato yields has a pivotal role in realizing the continued leap forward in grain this year.

Early seedling cultivation and early planting have a decisive effect on increasing sweet potato yield. The sweet potato was originally a tropical perennial crop. Its stems and leaves only begin to form tubers after growing to a certain extent, and the tubers only grow larger in the later stages of its production. Early seedling cultivation, early planting, and appropriately extending the growing period of sweet potatoes can give full play to the high-yield performance of sweet potatoes and greatly increase its yield. According to a survey in Xichong County, Sichuan, under conditions of sufficient water and fertilizer, sweet potatoes with a growing period of more than 170 days yield more than 10,000 catties per mu; sweet potatoes with a growing period of about 150 days yield 8,000 to 9,000 catties per mu; sweet potatoes with a growing period of about 120 days yield about 5,000 catties per mu. The broad masses of farmers have created many valuable experiences in cultivating early seedlings, strong seedlings, and producing more seedlings in long-term production practice. This year, many places are widely promoting advanced methods such as warm bed seedling cultivation and kang (heated brick bed) seedling cultivation, making seedling cultivation one or two solar terms earlier than in previous years. This has created favorable conditions for timely early planting. Because early seedling cultivation and more seedling cultivation are common in various places, sweet potato seedlings are basically sufficient. However, because the planting area has been expanded this year, the planting time is short and concentrated, and the development of various places is uneven, some places still have a shortage of sweet potato seedlings. All localities should carefully calculate based on the cultivated area, and, based on the principle of mutual support and overall planning, try their best to allocate locally and solve locally. This can not only reduce the cost of planting sweet potatoes, but also ensure timely planting and improve the survival rate of sweet potato seedlings.

Time is pressing. All counties and communes that plant sweet potatoes must quickly implement the plans for tuber production, and take various practical and effective measures to ensure the area, ensure the quality, and ensure the timely completion of spring sweet potato planting. From now on, we must also do a good job in various preparations for summer sweet potato planting to ensure a bumper sweet potato harvest this year.

    还要多种一些甘薯
    春薯的栽插季节开始了。今年许多地方打破了“三月清明下薯种，五月端阳插薯苗”的旧农历，育苗和栽插都比往年提早了一、两个节令。这给又早又多又快又好地种植甘薯，争取今年甘薯的大丰收准备了一个良好的开端。
    多种高产作物，是迅速增产粮食的一个可靠办法。甘薯是粮食作物的高产之王。历年的经验证明，哪里种的甘薯多，哪里的粮食增长速度就快。从1949年至1959年的十年中，全国粮食作物的播种面积扩大了20％左右，而甘薯的种植面积扩大了一倍多；全国粮食的总产量增长了一倍多，而甘薯的总产量增加了四倍。甘薯的平均单位面积产量比全国粮食作物单位平均产量高30％以上，成为所有粮食作物中产量最高的作物。因此，根据农业生产的统一安排，适当地发展薯类（主要是甘薯）生产，对于加速发展我国粮食生产，有很大作用。在人多地少地区和低产地区，多种一些甘薯，更为重要。河北省历年缺粮，从去年起全省粮食作到基本自给，最重要的经验之一是多种甘薯和其他高产作物。今年全国人民代表大会通过的全国农业发展纲要第十条也明确规定：“根据需要和民食习惯，适当地发展玉米和薯类等高产作物”，可见这是实现粮食生产大跃进的重要措施。
    甘薯是广大城乡居民喜爱的口粮，有很多地区还把薯类作为主要的食粮。有人认为成立起公共食堂以后，就可以少吃或不吃甘薯了，就可以少种甚至不种薯类了。这种观点是片面的。广大人民群众并不因为他们参加了公共食堂就改变了喜爱吃甘薯的习惯。事实上参加了公共食堂的城乡居民，更要求多种一些甘薯，使自己的伙食更加丰富多样。薯类作物又是很好的精饲料和重要的工业原料。畜牧业，特别是养猪业的发展，也要求多种一些甘薯，用它的叶蔓薯块作饲料。社办工业和国家工业同样要求多种一些甘薯，因为甘薯可以综合利用，制成许多有益于国计民生的产品。为了改善人民生活，为了满足畜牧业大发展的需要，为了给食品工业和化学工业提供更多的原料，一句话，为了实现农业生产更好更全面的继续跃进，为了促进整个国民经济更快地向前发展，各地都应该尽可能地多种一些薯类作物。
    多种一些甘薯，这并不是说要挤掉或减少其他作物的种植面积。我国是一个农产品十分丰富的国家，国家经济建设和人民生活对农产品的要求是多种多样的。粮食作物需要扩大种植面积，棉花、油料、烟、糖等经济作物的面积也要有一定的发展。各个地区要根据国家的计划，根据当地的需要和条件，从省、县到社、队，把甘薯的种植面积逐级落实，保证把计划种植的甘薯种上并且种好。同时要大力发掘土地利用的潜力，争取在不影响各种作物种植面积的条件下多种一些甘薯。多种还要多收。薯类是高产作物，它的增产潜力现在仍然是很大的，提高单位产量大有可为。自从1958年、1959年连续两年大跃进以来，各地已出现不少甘薯亩产万斤以上的大面积丰产纪录。四川省西充县二十三万亩甘薯，去年平均亩产六千二百七十八斤（比全国甘薯的平均产量高二倍以上），其中八万亩高产田亩产万斤以上。如果全国的甘薯产量都能提高到西充县的水平，我国甘薯的总产量就可以跃增一两倍，达到（折粮食）三千亿斤左右。可见力争甘薯的高产，对于实现今年粮食的继续跃进，实在有举足轻重的作用。
    早育苗，早栽插，对于甘薯产量的增加，具有决定性的作用。甘薯原是一种热带多年生作物，它的茎叶生长到一定程度以后，才开始形成薯块，直到它的生产后期，薯块才能长大。早育苗，早栽插，适当延长甘薯的生长期，就可以充分发挥甘薯的高产性能，大大提高它的产量。根据四川西充县的调查，在水、肥充足的条件下，甘薯生长期在一百七十天以上的，亩产达万斤以上；生长期在一百五十天左右的，亩产八、九千斤；生长期在一百二十天左右的，亩产五千斤左右。广大农民在长期的生产实践中创造了很多培育早苗、壮苗和多出苗的宝贵经验。今年许多地方普遍推广温床育苗、火炕育苗等先进方法，育苗比往年提早一、两个节令。这就为适时地提早栽插创造了有利的条件。由于各地普遍早育苗，多育苗，薯苗基本上够用。但因今年种植面积有所扩大，栽插的时间短而集中，加上各地情况发展不平衡，有的地方还有缺少薯苗现象。各地应根据栽培面积仔细算笔账，本着互相支援、统筹安排的原则，尽可能作到就地调拨，就地解决，这样不仅可以降低栽种甘薯的成本，更可以保证适时栽插，提高薯苗的成活率。
    时间已很紧迫，凡是种植甘薯的县、公社，都要将薯类生产的计划迅速落实，并且采取各种切实有效的措施，保证面积，保证质量，保证适时地做好春薯的栽插。从现在起，还要同时做好夏薯种植的各项准备工作，确保今年甘薯的大丰收。
