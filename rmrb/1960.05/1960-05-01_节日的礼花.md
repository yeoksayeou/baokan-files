Festive Fireworks
Wang Shu
Looking up, a sea of flowers,
Innovation blossoms hung in the sky,
A production line takes flight in the east,
Automation flashes in the west.
Stars in the sky, dense and thick,
Another basketful scattered towards the heavens,
Don't say star-flowers fill the Milky Way,
Workers' wisdom covers heaven and earth.

    节日的礼花
    王术抬头看，一片花，革新花朵天上挂，东边飞起流水线，西边闪出自动化。天上星，密又密，朝天再撒一簸箕，莫道星花满银河，工人的智慧盖天地。
