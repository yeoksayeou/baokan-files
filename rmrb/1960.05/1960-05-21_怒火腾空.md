	Soaring Anger (Brand Tune)
	Quyi Monthly Editorial Department (Opening)
	Our sky is beautiful and bright,
	A clear sky, a vast east wind!
	Under this clear sky,
	Stands the great socialist camp.
  The magnificent peace construction is underway,
  The song of labor resounds through the sky! (Yun Su Tune)
  Under the clear sky, we build peace,
  Under the clear sky, we resolutely defend peace.
  Under the clear sky, our socialist camp is as
	  united as steel,
  We oppose wars of aggression, and we are not afraid of
	  war!
  We will not allow imperialist bandits to invade,
  We will never allow bandits to invade our sacred
	  airspace!
  If the imperialists dare to provoke,
  We'll make sure they can't escape the net and have nowhere to be buried alive! (Year of Peace)
  Eisenhower, peddling war,
  Jackal nature, destroying peace,
  He is bent on sabotaging the summit conference,
  On the eve of the meeting, he schemed and conjured up an evil wind!
  The ringleader gave the order, sending a thief,
  Slipped into the sacred airspace of the Soviet Union,
  Sneakingly engaged in espionage activities,
  With a bang, he was knocked upside down by a Soviet rocket!
  The ringleader was shocked, first pretending to be deaf and
	  dumb,
  With all the stolen goods in evidence, he couldn't pretend to be a mute.
  He insisted that the invasion of the Soviet Union was a reasonable action,
  Reciting his imperialist black-hearted
	  script. (Linked Pearl Tune)
  American imperialism revealed its ferocious face,
  Enraging the Soviet people with soaring anger!
  To invade the Soviet Union is to invade China,
  Our socialist camp is a close-knit
	  family!
  Six hundred million people raise their iron fists and swear together,
  Resolutely support the just struggle of the Soviet people!
  A billion people stand shoulder to shoulder, standing tall,
  We are infinitely powerful in striking at the aggressors!
  We are the rising sun with a bright future,
  You imperialists have done so many bad things that your life won't be long
  and your candle will soon burn out. If you dare to launch a war of aggression,
  that is to seek your own destruction and accelerate your entry into the grave. A billion people shout and the earth shakes, We must resolutely defend the world's lasting peace!

    怒火腾空（牌子曲）
    曲艺月刊编辑部（曲头）
    我们的天空，美丽光明，
    晴空万里，浩荡东风！
    在这晴空之下，
    屹立着伟大的社会主义阵营。
  宏伟的和平建设正进行，
  劳动的歌声响彻天空！（云苏调）
  晴空下，我们和平来建设，
  晴空下，我们坚决保卫和平。
  晴空下，我们社会主义阵营团
    结似钢铁，
  我们反对侵略战争，也不怕战
      争！
  我们不许帝国主义匪徒来侵
      犯，
  决不许匪徒侵犯我们神圣的领
      空！
  帝国主义胆敢来挑衅，
  管叫他难逃罗网无处葬身活不
      成！（太平年）
  艾森豪威尔，贩卖战争，
  豺狼成性，破坏和平，
  他一心要破坏首脑会议，
  会议前夕他阴谋诡计刮妖风！
  贼头子传下令，派了飞贼一名，
  溜进了苏联的神圣领空，
  贼眉鼠眼地搞开了间谍活动，
  轰的一声，被苏联火箭打了个
      倒栽葱！
  贼头子吃一惊，先是装哑又装
      聋，
  赃证俱全，哑吧又装不成。
  硬说是侵犯苏联是合理行动，
  念出了他帝国主义一本黑心
      经。（联珠调）
  美帝国主义露出来他的狰狞面
      目，
  激怒了苏联人民怒火腾空！
  侵犯苏联就是侵犯中国，
  我们社会主义阵营是一个亲密
      的大家庭！
  六亿人民高举铁拳齐宣誓，
  坚决支持苏联人民正义的斗
    争！
  十亿人民并肩而立顶天立地，
  打击那侵略者我们力大无穷！
  我们是太阳初升前程万里，
  你帝国主义坏事做绝寿命不长
  就要鬼吹灯。你若是胆敢把侵略战争来发
  动，那就是自寻灭亡加快走进坟墓
  中。十亿人民大喝一声天摇地动，我们要坚决保卫全世界持久和
  平！
