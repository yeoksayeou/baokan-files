Comrades, friends!

Forty-five years ago today, the Northern Warlord Government, colluding with Japanese imperialism, signed the Twenty-One Demands, a traitorous treaty, which aroused the public indignation of all Chinese people. Later, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people stood up, overthrew the traitorous government, overthrew imperialism, and achieved a great victory in the national democratic revolution.

Now, disaster has befallen the Japanese people. The Kishi Nobusuke government and the Japanese reactionaries are following the old path of Yuan Shikai, colluding with U.S. imperialism to sign the traitorous Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

The U.S. bandits and the Japanese reactionaries have extremely vicious intentions. They are reviving Japanese militarism, plotting a new war of aggression in the Far East, trying to turn Japan into a base of aggression, and making the Japanese people cannon fodder in the war of aggression.

Comrades, friends! Can we ignore this? We absolutely cannot ignore this!

The Japanese people are our friends. U.S. imperialism is the enemy of the Chinese people, the enemy of the Japanese people, and the common enemy of the people of the world. The Chinese people will definitely support the Japanese people, overthrow U.S. imperialism, overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary government, and completely abolish the notorious Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty!

Let us salute the heroic Japanese people's struggle!

U.S. bandits must get out of Japan! Get out of South Korea! Get out of South Vietnam! Get out of our territory of Taiwan! Get out of all of Asia!

Victory will always belong to the people who are fighting heroically!

    向英勇斗争的日本人民致敬
    中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒的讲话同志们，朋友们！
    四十五年前的今天，北洋军阀政府，勾结日本帝国主义，签订二十一条卖国条约，引起了全中国人民的公愤。后来，中国人民在中国共产党领导之下，站起来了，打倒卖国政府，打倒帝国主义，取得了民族民主革命的伟大胜利。
    现在，灾难临到了日本人民的头上，岸信介政府和日本反动派，走袁世凯的老路，勾结美帝国主义，签订卖国的日美军事同盟条约。
    美国强盗和日本反动派，用心是十分恶毒的。它们复活日本军国主义，在远东策划新的侵略战争，要把日本变成侵略基地，要使日本人民去当侵略战争的炮灰。
    同志们，朋友们！我们能置之不理吗？我们决不能置之不理！
    日本人民是我们的朋友。美帝国主义是中国人民的敌人，是日本人民的敌人，也是全世界人民的共同敌人。中国人民一定支援日本人民，打倒美帝国主义，打倒岸信介反动政府，把臭名远扬的日美军事同盟条约，一笔勾销！
    让我们向英勇斗争的日本人民致敬！
    美国强盗一定要从日本滚出去！从南朝鲜滚出去！从南越滚出去！从我国领土台湾滚出去！从整个亚洲滚出去！
    胜利永远是属于英勇斗争的人民！
