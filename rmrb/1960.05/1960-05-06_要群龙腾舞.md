    To Make the Dragons Dance in Swarms
    Cheng Pu
    With the deepening development of the tool reform movement, more and more new complete sets of tools are appearing in agricultural production. A "dragon" here, a "dragon" there. The "dragons" have become a swarm, which means that the production process is moving towards mechanization and semi-mechanization. Dragons come in various forms: some may be composed of improved tools that are basically operated manually, some may be mainly composed of semi-mechanized new tools, some may be composed of both semi-mechanized tools and machinery, and some may be entirely composed of modern machinery. The more "dragons", the better. Regardless of the type of "dragon", as long as it can reduce people's physical labor and improve labor efficiency, and can carry out intensive cultivation to increase yields, it is welcome. Under the current conditions, improved tools should not be neglected, and all regions should manufacture and promote them in large quantities; but at the same time, the proportion of semi-mechanized tools and modern machinery in various "dragons" should be increased as much as possible. The higher the degree of semi-mechanization and mechanization, the greater the power of the "dragon."
    To improve the degree of semi-mechanization and mechanization, more power must be obtained. The Yantai Special District of Shandong Province is completely correct in grasping tool matching on the one hand and power on the other in the agricultural technology innovation and technical revolution. When creating any new production tool, the power it needs must be considered at the same time, and attention should be paid to saving manpower and animal power as much as possible. If animal power can be used, do not use manpower; if there are conditions for using power machinery (whether it is a modern engine or a simple water turbine and windmill), do not use manpower and animal power. This requires grasping with both hands. Not only should efforts be made to make the new tools complete and become "dragons", but also these new tools should be given powerful power. A "dragon" will not be very powerful when a series of its components have not yet obtained power; once it obtains power, it will become a giant dragon that can fly freely and is very powerful. Therefore, even in places where new tools have already been matched into "dragons", it is still necessary to use your brains to see if more power can be obtained, and the proportion of semi-mechanization and mechanization can be increased, so that those "dragons" become more powerful "dragons".
    Where does the power come from? It is of course best to have more modern power machinery. The national industrial departments are also vigorously increasing the production of such agricultural machinery and the fuel they need, but at present, relying solely on these is far from meeting actual needs. The people's communes must do it themselves, adopt the method of indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and using local materials to fully utilize local power resources, such as water, wind, biogas, natural gas, etc., and do everything possible to solve the power problem of agricultural machinery. A waterwheel and a wooden water turbine may seem like the simplest indigenous things, but when they transmit the great natural forces of water and wind to various complete sets of new tools, the face of production will undergo remarkable changes. As a result of "seeking power from water, wind, and fire (comprehensive utilization of gas)", the Yantai Special District has basically realized the semi-mechanization of the summer harvest and summer planting tools that have been matched into "dragons", and will achieve the goal of cutting wheat in seven days and completing threshing in ten days this summer. This is such an amazing speed.
    The agricultural technology innovation and technical revolution movement is developing rapidly, and the flowers of innovation are colorful. May more "dragons" appear everywhere, and may swarms of "dragons" leap and dance!

    要群龙腾舞
    程浦
    随着工具改革运动的深入发展，农业生产中配套成龙的新工具越来越多了。这里一条龙，那里一条龙，龙成了群，就意味着生产过程正在走向机械化和半机械化。龙有各种各样：有的可能是基本上由手工操作的改良工具组成，有的可能是主要由半机械化的新工具组成，有的可能是由半机械化工具和机械共同组成，有的也可能完全是由现代机械组成的。龙，是越多越好。不论哪一种龙，只要它能减轻人们的体力劳动和提高劳动效率，能进行精耕细作提高产量，就值得欢迎。在目前的条件下，改良工具是不容忽视的，一切地区都应当大量制造和推广；但同时也应当尽量增加各种龙中的半机械化工具和现代化机械的比重。半机械化、机械化的程度愈高，龙的威力也愈大。
    要提高半机械化、机械化的程度，就得取得更多的动力。山东烟台专区在农业技术革新和技术革命中一手抓工具配套，一手抓动力，完全正确。在创造任何一种新的生产工具的时候，都要同时考虑到它所需要的动力，注意尽量节省人力和畜力，能用畜力的，就不要用人力；有条件使用动力机械（不管是现代化的发动机，还是简易的水轮机和风力机）的，就不要用人力和畜力。这就需要两手一齐抓，不仅要努力使新工具配成套，变成龙，而且要使这些新工具得到强大的动力。一条龙，当着它的一系列的组成部分还没有获得动力的时候，它的威力还不会很大；一旦获得了动力，它就会变成一条飞腾自如、威力很大的巨龙了。所以，就是新工具已经配套成龙的地方，也还需要动动脑筋，看看能不能多搞些动力，增加半机械化、机械化的比重，使得那些龙变成威力更大的龙。
    动力从何而来呢？多搞些现代化的动力机械当然是最好不过了，国家工业部门也正在大力增产这类农业机械和它们所需要的燃料，但是，目前光靠这些远不能满足实际需要。人民公社要自己动手，采取土法上马，土洋结合，就地取材的办法，充分利用当地的动力资源，如水、风、沼气、天然气等等，千方百计地解决农业机械的动力问题。一架水车、一部木制水轮机，看来都是些最简陋的土东西，但当它们把水力和风力这样的伟大的自然力传递给各种成套的新工具的时候，生产的面貌就会发生了不起的变化。烟台专区由于“向水、风、火（综合利用煤气）要动力”的结果，使得已经配套成龙的夏收夏种工具基本上实现半机械化，今年夏收时将做到七天割完小麦，十天完成脱谷。这是多么惊人的速度。
    农业技术革新和技术革命运动正在一日千里向前发展，革新的花朵万紫千红。愿各地出现更多的一条龙，愿成群的龙腾跃飞舞！
