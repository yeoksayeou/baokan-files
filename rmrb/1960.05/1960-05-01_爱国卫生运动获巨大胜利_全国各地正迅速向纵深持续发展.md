Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch: The first battle of the large-scale spring patriotic health campaign has achieved a great victory, and urban and rural areas across the country are clean and tidy in welcoming International Labor Day on May 1st. At present, the movement is rapidly developing in depth and sustained across the country.

This spring patriotic health campaign began in late March. The characteristics of the movement are: under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, with the First Secretary taking the lead, the masses are fully mobilized, and the high tide of the health movement has come quickly and fiercely, rapidly sweeping the country. During the assault week held in Qinghai Province in early April, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee took the lead, and responsible Party and government cadres below the secretary level went to the masses to participate in activities, making the movement spread to all aspects of towns, villages, and pastoral areas throughout the province. In Tianjin, in just one month from March 26 to April 26, the counties within the city carried out more than a dozen large-scale health assault battles, mobilizing more than 10 million person-times, eliminating more than 60,000 square meters of mosquito and fly breeding grounds, clearing more than 1.2 million tons of garbage, and dredging waste ditches such as the Qiangzi River, greatly improving the sanitary environment. During this period, provinces and cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Jiangsu carried out continuous and in-depth health publicity activities and health assault movements one wave after another. Since mid-to-late April, all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country have organized large-scale health inspections. These have powerfully promoted the development of the health movement.

In the movement, various places carried out competitions to learn from and catch up with the advanced, advancing towards high standards. The experiences of the two red flags on the national health front: rural health in Jishan, Shanxi, and urban health work in Foshan, Guangdong, have been promoted in urban and rural areas across the country. “Learn from Foshan, catch up with Foshan, surpass Foshan” and “Learn from Jishan, catch up with Jishan, surpass Jishan” have become a vivid and lively part of the current health movement. Cities such as Nanning, Guilin, Liuzhou, and Wuzhou in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are carrying out health competitions with "Learn from Foshan, catch up with Foshan, surpass Foshan" as the theme. In Guilin, because everyone acted together, 90% of the city's government offices were transformed into "hygienic homes" in the first three days. In Changsha, Hunan, in the process of learning from Foshan's experience and carrying out health movements, great efforts were made to rectify the city's appearance. In the past month, the city's 315 roads and bluestone streets have been generally washed with water two or three times, more than 10,000 street ditches have been cleaned and sewage ponds filled in, more than 4,600 street-center parks and flower beds have been built, and a large number of ornamental plants and more than 160,000 trees have been planted throughout the city, and the city's appearance has been completely renewed. All provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have produced a batch of health red flags, such as Xicheng District and Changping County in Beijing, Qingdao City and Rizhao County in Shandong Province, Ningbo City and Yueqing County in Zhejiang Province, and Zhangzhou City and Jianning County in Fujian Province. Various places have quickly promoted the experiences of these advanced regions through organizing visits and holding on-site meetings, making the health movement bloom everywhere and reap large-scale harvests. In learning from and catching up with the advanced, various places have also put forward higher standards, carried out basic health construction, and moved forward in big strides towards completely changing the sanitary conditions of cities and villages. In more than a month, the suburbs of Beijing built 1,100 closed stirred manure pools (ie, manure storage), providing conditions for eliminating mosquito and fly breeding conditions and improving environmental hygiene. In many rural people's communes in Hubei Province, natural villages were used as units to dredge the sewage ditches of every household, change open ditches to covered ditches, and connect them into a complete underground sewage drainage system, so that sewage converges into manure storage ponds farther from the village; some unnecessary toilets, manure piles, and sewage pits have been completely eliminated, greatly improving the environmental hygiene of rural areas.

Technical innovation and technical revolution in the patriotic health movement are also progressing rapidly. According to incomplete statistics, sanitation workers in Beijing have innovated more than 400 cleaning tools. Cleaning workers in Beijing, Shenyang, Guiyang, Jinan and other places have made tools such as car sweepers, battery-powered fast road sweepers, and vacuum manure suction machines, which have increased work efficiency by more than a dozen or even a hundred times. The masses in Shanghai, Hangzhou and other places have made electric mosquito traps, sound and light flavor mosquito killers, automatic fly killers and other tools, which have improved the efficiency of trapping and killing mosquitoes and flies.

After this major health inspection, various places are now summarizing the experience of the previous stage and holding various meetings for promotion; on the other hand, they are actively arranging the work for the next stage to push the health movement to a new upsurge more deeply and widely.

    爱国卫生运动获巨大胜利
    全国各地正迅速向纵深持续发展
  据新华社29日讯　声势浩大春季爱国卫生运动的第一个战役已取得巨大胜利，各地城乡干干净净地迎接“五一”国际劳动节。目前，运动正在全国范围迅速向纵深持续发展。
    这次春季爱国卫生运动是在3月下旬开始的。运动的特点是：各地在各级党委的领导下，第一书记挂帅，充分发动群众，卫生运动的高潮来得快，来得猛，很快席卷全国。青海省在4月上旬举行的突击周，省委第一书记挂帅，书记以下的党、政负责干部都到群众中去参加活动，使运动遍及全省大小城镇、农村、牧区的各个方面，天津市从3月26日至4月26日的一个月中，仅市内各县就连续进行了十几次大规模的卫生突击战，出动一千多万人次，消灭蚊蝇孳生地六万多平方米，清除垃圾一百二十多万吨，疏通了墙子河等废沟，大大改善卫生面貌。在这一期间，北京、上海、江苏等省、市，都一浪接一浪，连续深入地进行了卫生宣传活动和卫生突击运动。全国各省、市、自治区从4月中、下旬以来，都组织了大规模的卫生检查。这些，有力地推动了卫生运动的开展。
    在运动中，各地开展了学先进赶先进的竞赛，向着高标准前进。全国卫生战线上的两面红旗：山西稷山农村卫生、广东佛山城市卫生工作的经验，已在各地城乡推广，“学佛山、赶佛山、超佛山”、“学稷山、赶稷山、超稷山”，已成为目前卫生运动中的一项生动活泼的内容。广西僮族自治区南宁、桂林、柳州、梧州等城市以“学佛山、赶佛山、超佛山”为内容，开展卫生竞赛。桂林市由于上下一齐动手，最初三天中就使全市90％的机关变成了“卫生之家”。湖南长沙市在学习佛山经验，开展卫生运动当中，大力整顿市容，一个月来已把市内三百十五条马路和麻石街普遍用水冲洗了两三次，清洗街沟和填没污水塘等一万多处，修建街心公园、花圃四千六百多个，全市栽植大量的观赏植物和十六万多株树木，城市面貌已焕然一新。各省、市、自治区都出现了一批卫生红旗，如：北京市的西城区、昌平县、山东省的青岛市、日照县，浙江省的宁波市、乐清县，福建省的漳州市、建宁县等，各地通过组织参观、召开现场会议，迅速推广了这些先进地区的经验，使卫生运动遍地开花，大面积丰收。在学先进、赶先进当中，各地还提出了更高的标准，进行卫生基本建设，朝着彻底改变城市和农村卫生面貌的方向大步前进。北京市郊区一个多月修建了一千一百座密闭式搅拌粪稀池（即粪库），为消灭蚊蝇孳生条件、改善环境卫生提供了条件。湖北省许多农村人民公社以自然村为单位，把每家每户的污水沟疏通，明沟改为暗沟，联成完整的地下排污水系统，使污水汇入离村较远的贮粪池；一些不必要的厕所、粪堆、污水坑，已全部淘汰。使农村的环境卫生面貌大为改观。
    爱国卫生运动中的技术革新和技术革命也进展得很快。据不完全统计，北京市清洁工人革新清扫工具有四百多项。北京、沈阳、贵阳、济南等地的清洁工人制的汽车扫路机、电瓶快速扫道机、真空吸粪机等工具，提高工效十几倍以至百倍以上。上海、杭州等地的群众制成电动诱蚊器、声光味灭蚊器、自动灭蝇器等工具，提高了诱杀蚊蝇的效率。
    经过这次卫生大检查后，目前各地一方面正在总结前一阶段的经验，举行各种会议进行推广；另一方面积极安排下一阶段的工作，把卫生运动更深入更广泛地推向新的高潮。
