Actively Launch a Teaching Reform Movement
Li Huang, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee

Our province's education revolution movement was launched on the basis of the rectification and anti-rightist struggle in 1957. Over the past two years, it has achieved two major victories: (1) Firmly establishing the Party's leadership over education work; (2) Implementing the policy of "education serving proletarian politics, education combined with productive labor," and the two-legged approach to developing education.

At the very beginning of the education revolution movement, we touched upon the issue of how to reform teaching content, that is, how to overcome the problems of "less, slower, worse, and more expensive" in teaching and how to implement the general line in teaching to achieve "more, faster, better, and more economical." All cities and counties in our province have made many efforts in this regard and have achieved considerable results. The teaching reform experience of Beiguan Primary School in Heishan, however, is based on the spirit of the general line and the Great Leap Forward, and further fundamentally changes the phenomenon of "less, slower, worse, and more expensive" in teaching, embodying the principles of "more, faster, better, and more economical."

Under the leadership of the county party committee, Beiguan Primary School in Heishan, holding high the brilliant banner of Mao Zedong Thought, based on the spirit of the general line, launched a vigorous mass movement, promoted the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, and testing everything through experimentation, resolutely struggled against the phenomenon of "less, slower, worse, and more expensive" in teaching, and found a better way to achieve "more, faster, better, and more economical" in teaching, creating undeniable achievements and successful experiences. Although this experience is not yet perfect, it is a very encouraging and good start. There are two aspects to the Heishan experience: one is the experience of the pilot project in the first and second grades of Beiguan Primary School, which has been tested and has achieved success; the other is some ideas based on the spirit of the general line and the Great Leap Forward, which are in line with the spirit of the general line, but require solving many problems in future practice. The basic experience of Heishan in implementing the general line and the spirit of the Great Leap Forward in teaching is of universal significance. It is not only applicable to Heishan, but also to all cities and counties in our province; it is not only applicable to primary schools, but also to schools of all levels and types. To learn from the Heishan experience, we must first grasp the fundamental spirit of this experience and implement this fundamental spirit in teaching reform, rather than mechanically imitating their every specific practice. If we cannot grasp this fundamental spirit, then we will not be able to learn the Heishan experience well.

The Heishan County Party Committee has conducted a good summary of their specific experiences in teaching reform, and has also made two reports successively, which has enabled us to understand the entire picture of the Heishan experience more completely and deeply. I think there are three points in the Heishan teaching reform experience that need to be specially mentioned:

First, their teaching reform was preceded by thorough investigation and research. For example, they found the rules of Chinese characters through research, investigated children's vocabulary, children's acceptance ability, and so on. Moreover, in accordance with the principle of testing everything through experimentation, after a year and a half of teaching practice, the pilot class fundamentally transformed the curriculum content, removing the excessive and unnecessary cycles in the original textbooks, retaining the necessary cycles; removing the repetitive, outdated, cumbersome, and fragmented things, and reorganizing the teaching content, so that it truly conforms to the scientific system. If they take this approach a step further, continue to develop it, and practice it for a certain period of time, then it may be possible to establish a new system of courses in various subjects guided by Mao Zedong Thought that truly conforms to scientific laws. What has been achieved now will be a good start for this kind of thorough destruction and thorough establishment work.

Second, they have truly changed the "cramming" teaching method. In the pilot project, Beiguan Primary School in Heishan paid attention to stimulating students' enthusiasm and initiative in learning, and implemented "teaching less but practicing more," that is, the teacher explains the basic knowledge clearly and thoroughly, so that students fully understand it, and then give full play to students' ability to think independently, further drawing inferences from one instance, making analogies, and reaching a thorough understanding of the knowledge they have learned. There may be various understandings of "teaching less but practicing more," such as teaching less in quantity is considered concise, or teaching a lot of content in one class is called concise, etc., which are all incorrect. The correct understanding should be to explain the fundamental problems clearly and thoroughly so that students can easily understand them.

Third, they require all students to learn the courses well and consolidate the knowledge they have learned, that is, the so-called "grasping the middle and lower levels firmly and achieving an all-round leap forward," which is exactly the requirement that our educators should strive to achieve and must achieve.

The experience of teaching reform in Heishan is not only about reforming teaching content and methods, but also about breaking many absurd arguments in bourgeois educational theory. After promoting the Heishan experience and continuing to develop it in depth, combined with other advanced experiences in various educational works, our own educational science guided by Mao Zedong Thought will naturally be formed.

There are still some shortcomings in the Heishan Beiguan pilot project, which are inevitable and temporary shortcomings in the process of teaching reform. These shortcomings do not detract from their successful experience in the slightest. Moreover, we believe that these shortcomings will be made up for before long.

The pilot experience of Beiguan Primary School in Heishan has given us a profound education and further made us realize that all work must be led by Mao Zedong Thought, must implement the Party's general line, must have the strong leadership of the Party committee, must launch a vigorous mass movement, and must promote the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, and testing everything through experimentation. Can the Communist Party lead education? Bourgeois rightists say we can't, "laymen cannot lead professionals." The Heishan experience proves that only under the leadership of the Party can education be run well. With the leadership of the Party, anything can be done, there is nothing that cannot be done.

How to learn from and promote the Heishan experience and do a good job in teaching reform?

First of all, we must do a good job in ideological work, further shatter bourgeois educational ideas and theories, and mobilize the vast number of educators to work together for teaching reform. Carrying out teaching reform and promoting the Heishan experience will not be without difficulties and obstacles, and the first thing we will encounter will be various doubts and resistances in our minds. Therefore, to do a good job in teaching reform, we must first carry out ideological revolution, which must involve criticizing bourgeois academic thought and further launching a movement to liberate the mind. This involves class struggle, as well as the struggle between the advanced and the backward, and between the correct and the erroneous. However, ideological problems are complex problems, and we must analyze various ideological obstacles specifically, treat them differently, and adhere to presenting the facts and reasoning things out, without simplifying things.

In the process of teaching reform, these problems will naturally be encountered: (1) Is the teaching speed so fast that children can accept it? (2) If children can barely accept it, is the burden too heavy, which will affect their physical and mental development in the future? (3) Was the Heishan experience obtained under special conditions? Can it be promoted universally? (4) Will carrying out teaching reform in a "more, faster, better, and more economical" way increase the burden on teachers? Can teachers keep up? (5) Will such a bold reform cause "chaos"? (6) How to connect various school systems during the transition? And so on. It is very natural and not surprising that people have these doubts. We must carry out persuasive education work in response to these many thoughts. We must use facts to show that the current teaching content is far behind the level of children's intellectual development, thus causing poor classroom order, cumbersome, repetitive, and chaotic courses, which in turn cause students to be overburdened. Teaching reform, raising the level, is based on meeting children's knowledge requirements as the standard, not without restrictions, which will only stimulate children's enthusiasm for learning and improve children's ability to accept, and will not cause children to be overburdened. Heishan Beiguan Primary School does not have any special conditions, which is why their experience is most valuable. The pilot teachers of Heishan Beiguan Primary School are all graduates of junior normal school, and their level is not high. Their secret is "doing it with all their might." Their various reforms have gradually developed in practice. Can the level of teachers be improved? Yes. Teaching reform has inspired the enthusiasm of teachers, and everyone will inevitably improve their teaching level, and the speed at which they improve their teaching level must be faster than the speed required by students. Therefore, "as the water rises, the boat rises," the level of teachers can be improved. The Heishan experience has already proven this point. With the continuous improvement of the level of teachers, the teaching burden of teachers will gradually be relatively reduced. If individual teachers, in the process of teaching reform, are unable to teach the courses of the original class for certain reasons and need to be transferred, their treatment must not be reduced, and collective welfare should be gradually increased in accordance with government regulations to ensure their livelihood and give them opportunities for further study to help them gradually improve their professional level. Therefore, all educators must respond to Comrade Lu Dingyi's call: "Think about the society, think about the future generations, think about communism, and don't just think about yourself, just think about your own line of work." In short, for all these questions, we must present the facts, reason things out, and persuade and explain, without simplifying things. We must dare to listen to opposing opinions and not be afraid of opposing opinions. Letting others express different opinions will only benefit us and not harm us, "listen to both sides and you will be enlightened." Teaching reform is correct, and no one can attack it or reverse it. As for how to reform which course, we must study it specifically. We welcome everyone to put forward various opinions on these specific issues. We must carry out a mass movement of great publicity and great discussion in the education system and in society, and put all kinds of opinions on the table. Because teaching reform involves a wide range of aspects, involving education administrative cadres, teachers, parents, etc., we should make them all participate in this movement and support this major event that is beneficial to society, beneficial to future generations, and beneficial to the cause of socialism-communism.

In the process of promoting the Heishan experience, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party; for the pilot units, we must conduct timely inspections, deeply understand the situation, and help them solve specific problems. All localities must promptly summarize and exchange experiences, exchange pilot experiences, exchange advanced experiences in teaching reform, exchange various teaching experiences, exchange experiences in reforming teaching aids and manufacturing teaching aids, exchange experiences in productive labor, and exchange experiences in improving teachers' political and professional levels. All cities and counties must run well the spare-time further study of teachers, especially organizing all educators to seriously study Mao Zedong Thought. This is the fundamental problem of improving the teaching level and the quality of education.

China's socialist construction is leaping forward continuously with each passing day, and new problems facing educators will emerge every day, which requires us to constantly develop existing experiences and constantly create new experiences. Only in this way can we adapt to the needs of this rapidly developing situation. Any experience, which seems very good today, may be greatly insufficient tomorrow if it is not developed and improved, and if it does not absorb the advanced experiences of others to enrich it. Therefore, our educators must have such a style—never be satisfied with the existing achievements and constantly and tirelessly learn various advanced experiences. As one teacher said: we must understand that "there is always someone better". Chairman Mao said: "Modesty helps one to progress, while conceit makes one lag behind." Let us all encourage ourselves with Chairman Mao's words!

    积极开展教学改革运动
    中共辽宁省委书记  李荒
    我省教育革命运动，是在1957年整风、反右派斗争的基础上开展起来的。两年多来，已经取得了两大胜利：（1）巩固地树立起党对教育工作的领导权；
  （2）贯彻执行了“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，以及发展教育事业的两条腿走路方针。
    在教育革命运动一开始，我们就接触到如何改革教学内容问题，即如何克服教学中的少慢差费而在教学中执行总路线做到多快好省的问题。我省各市县在这方面都做了很多努力，并且取得了不少的成绩。黑山北关小学的教学改革经验，则是根据总路线、大跃进的精神，进一步从根本上改变了教学中少慢差费的现象而体现出多快好省的原则。
    黑山北关小学，在县委的领导下，高举毛泽东思想的光辉旗帜，根据总路线的精神，大搞群众运动，发扬敢想敢说敢做和一切经过试验的共产主义风格，坚决向教学工作中的少慢差费现象作斗争，给如何在教学中实现多快好省找出了较好的道路，创造出无可怀疑的成绩和成功的经验。虽然，这种经验还不够完善，但是，它是一个非常令人振奋的良好开端。黑山经验有两个方面：一个是经过考验，已经取得了成功的北关小学一、二年级试点的经验；另一个是根据总路线、大跃进精神所作的一些设想，这种设想是符合总路线精神的，但需要在今后实践中解决许多问题。黑山在教学中贯彻执行总路线、大跃进精神这个基本经验，是具有普遍意义的。它不仅适用于黑山，也适用于我们全省各市县；它不仅适用于小学，也适用于各级各类的学校。我们要学习黑山经验，必须首先掌握到这个经验的根本精神，并且把这个根本精神贯彻到教学改革中去，而不是机械地仿效他们的每一个具体作法。如果掌握不住这个根本精神，那么，是学不好黑山的经验的。
    黑山县委对他们进行教学改革的具体经验，已经进行了很好的总结，又先后做了两次报告，这就使我们更完全、更深入地了解了黑山经验的整个面貌。我认为，黑山教学改革经验中，有三点需要特别提出：
    第一、他们的教学改革是事先经过充分调查研究。例如他们经过研究，找出汉字的规律、调查儿童的语汇、儿童的接受能力，等等。并且，他们按照一切经过试验的原则，经过一年半来的教学实践，试点班从根本上改造了课程内容，去掉了原有教材中过多的、不必要的循环，保留了必要的循环；去掉了重复、陈腐、繁琐、支离破碎的东西，重新对教学内容进行了组织，使之真正符合科学的系统性。他们这种作法，再前进一步，继续发展，经过一定时期的实践，那么就可能建立起以毛泽东思想为指导的、真正符合科学规律的各门课程新体系。现在已做到的将是这种大破大立工作的一个良好的开端。
    第二、他们真正改变了“填鸭式”的教学方法。黑山北关小学在试点中，注意启发学生学习的积极性和主动性，实行“精讲多练”，就是教师将基本知识讲清楚、讲透彻，使学生完全理解而后再发挥学生的独立思考的能力，进一步去举一反三，触类旁通，对所学到的知识，达到融会贯通的地步。对“精讲多练”，可能有各种理解，如份量讲得少就是精，或者将很多内容一堂讲完叫做精等，这都是不对的。正确理解应是把根本问题讲清、讲透，使学生易于理解。
    第三、他们要求全体学生都能学好课程，并做到把学的知识巩固起来，即所谓“狠抓中下，全面跃进，这正是我们教育工作者所应努力达到而且必须达到的要求。
    黑山教学改革的经验，不只是改革了教学内容和方法，而且打破了资产阶级教育理论上的许多荒谬论点。推广黑山经验，继续深入发展之后，结合其他各种教育工作的先进经验，自然而然要形成我们自己的以毛泽东思想为指导的教育科学。
    黑山北关试点中还有一些缺点，这是教学改革过程中不可避免的、暂时的缺点。这些缺点丝毫不能使他们成功的经验减色。而且，我们相信，不要多久，这些缺点就会得到弥补的。
    黑山北关小学试点经验，使我们受到了深刻的教育，更进一步认识到，一切工作都必须毛泽东思想挂帅，都必须实行党的总路线，都必须有党委的坚强领导，都必须大搞群众运动，都必须发扬敢想敢说敢做和一切经过试验的共产主义风格。共产党能否领导教育？资产阶级右派分子说我们不行，“外行不能领导内行”。黑山经验证明：只有在党的领导下，才能办好教育。有了党的领导，什么事情都可以做成，没有做不到的事。
    如何学习和推广黑山经验，做好教学改革工作？
    首先要做好思想工作，进一步粉碎资产阶级的教育思想和理论，发动广大教育工作者，共同为进行教学改革而努力。进行教学改革，推广黑山经验，是不会没有困难和阻碍的，而首先碰到的将是思想上的各种怀疑和抵触。因此，要做好教学改革，必须首先实行思想革命，这必须进行对资产阶级学术思想的批判，和进一步开展解放思想运动。这是有阶级斗争，也有先进与落后、正确与谬误的斗争。但是，思想问题是个复杂的问题，我们对于各种思想障碍，要具体分析，区别对待，坚持摆事实，讲道理，不要简单化。
    在教学改革过程中，很自然地要碰到这些问题：
  （1）教学速度这么快，儿童是否接受得了？（2）儿童勉强接受得了，是否负担过重，会影响今后身心发展？（3）黑山的经验是否在特殊条件下取得的？是否能普遍推行？（4）多快好省地进行教学改革，是否会增加教师负担？教师是否能跟得上？（5）这样大胆改革是否会造成“混乱”？（6）过渡当中多种学制如何衔接？等等。人们发生这些怀疑是很自然的，不奇怪的。我们要针对这许多思想进行说服教育工作。我们要用事实说明现行教学内容大大落后于儿童智力发展水平，因而造成课堂秩序不好，课程繁琐、重复、凌乱进而又造成学生负担过重。而教学改革，提高程度，是以满足儿童的知识要求为标准的，不是毫无限制的，这只会启发儿童的学习积极性和提高儿童的接受能力，而不会引起儿童负担过重。黑山北关小学并没有什么特殊条件，正因这样，他们的经验才最可贵，黑山北关小学的试点教师，都是初师程度，程度不算高，他们的秘诀就是“干字当头”。他们的各种改革，都是在实践中逐渐发展起来的。教师水平能否提高呢？能。教学改革鼓舞了教师的积极性，就必然人人提高自己的教学水平，而他们提高自己教学水平的速度一定快于学生需要的速度。因此，“水涨船高”，教师水平是可以提高的。黑山的经验，已经证明了这一点。随着教师水平的不断提高，教师教学负担又会逐渐相对减轻的。如果有个别的教师，在教学改革过程中，确因某些原因而一时不能担任原来班级的课程而需要调动工作时，一定不降低他们的待遇，而且要按照政府的规定，逐步增加集体福利，使其生活得到保障，并给予他们进修的机会，帮助他们逐步提高业务水平。因此，全体教育工作者，要响应陆定一同志提出的号召：“要为社会着想，为后代着想，为共产主义着想，而不要光为个人着想，光为自己的一行一业着想”。总之，对所有这些疑问，都要摆事实，讲道理，说服解释，不要简单化。我们要敢于听反对意见，不要怕反对意见。让人家讲不同意见，对我们只有好处没有坏处，“兼听则明”。教学改革是正确的，是谁也攻不倒、反不掉的。至于哪门课如何改，要具体研究，在这些具体问题上大家提出各种意见，更是我们所欢迎的。我们要在教育系统，在社会上，进行大宣传、大讨论的群众运动，将各种意见摆开。因为教学改革工作关系方面很广泛，涉及到教育行政干部、教师、家长等，我们应当使他们都参加这项运动，支持这项有利于社会、有利于子孙后代、有利于社会主义——共产主义事业的大事。
    在推广黑山经验过程中，必须加强党的领导；对试点的单位，要及时进行检查，深入了解情况，帮助他们具体解决问题。各地要及时总结交流经验，交流试点经验，交流教学改革的先进经验，交流各种教学经验，交流教具改革和制造教具运动的经验，交流生产劳动的经验，交流提高教师政治、业务水平的经验。各市县要办好教师的业余进修，特别是要组织全体教育工作者，认真学习毛泽东思想。这是提高教学水平、教育质量的根本问题。
    我国的社会主义建设事业正在日新月异地持续跃进，出现在教育工作者面前的新问题将是天天不断，这就要求我们不断发展已有的经验，不断创造新的经验，只有这样，才能适应这种一日千里的形势发展的需要。任何经验，在今天看来是很好的，如果不去发展它，提高它，不吸收别人的先进经验来充实它，那么，在明天看来就可能大大不足了。因此，我们教育工作者，要有这样一种风格——永远不满足已有的成绩，时刻不懈的学习各种先进经验。像一位教师所说：要懂得“天外有天”。毛主席说：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。让我们大家共同用毛主席这句话来勉励自己！
