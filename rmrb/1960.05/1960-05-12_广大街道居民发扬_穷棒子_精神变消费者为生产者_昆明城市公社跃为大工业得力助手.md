Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 11th May: The industry run by the Kunming City People's Communes has become an important emerging force on the city's industrial front. Since 1958, the city's People's Communes have established more than 300 small factories and more than 900 production teams, nearly 100 of which are relatively large-scale with over 100 people. In less than two years, the total output value of the commune-run industry in the city has greatly increased. As a result of vigorously developing the urban People's Communes, more than 80,000 laborers from the urban residents have participated in production. Among them, more than 50,000 young and middle-aged women have gone to work in large-scale industry. The political, economic, and spiritual outlook of this frontier spring city has also undergone tremendous changes since the establishment of the People's Communes.

The industry run by the People's Communes in Kunming City adheres to the spirit of "poor stick" of starting from scratch and making do with whatever is available to develop production. Over the past year, production has grown by leaps and bounds. In 1958, the total output value of the city's commune-run industry was 25 million yuan, which increased to more than 150 million yuan in 1959, accounting for more than 11% of the city's total industrial output value. It is estimated that 350 million yuan can be completed this year. A large amount of raw materials used by these commune-run industries are waste materials in the city and scraps and leftovers from large factories. For example, the Panlong Lock Factory, which produced hundreds of thousands of locks last year, used all the scraps and waste materials from large factories as raw materials. The commune-run Panlong Electric Tool Factory uses the scraps of silicon steel sheets used by the Kunming Electric Motor Factory to manufacture electric motors as raw materials for manufacturing electric tools. According to statistics, among the products self-made by the city's commune-run industries, those made from scraps and waste materials account for more than 52%, and more than 90% of the raw materials needed for repair and service production are solved by waste recycling.

The factories run by the People's Communes in Kunming City have become a powerful assistant to large-scale industry, and have also produced a large number of products needed for people's lives in Kunming City, which has a relatively weak industrial base. 85% of the products of the city's commune-run industry serve large-scale industry and people's lives. The commune-run industry has processed a large number of machine parts for state-owned factories, and also produced a large number of forgings, screws, rivets, adobe, ammonia, asbestos products and other products needed by large factories. The commune-run industry also produces a large number of clothing, shoes, leather, cotton wadding, daily hardware, stationery, household appliances and medicines to supply the market, and the packaging paper boxes and paper bags used by commercial departments to package goods are also mostly supplied by the commune-run industry.

Among the employees of the People's Communes industries in Kunming City, more than 90% are family members of employees and housewives. In the melting pot of collective production and collective life, they have transformed from consumers into producers and have gradually mastered cultural technology. Many housewives have become outstanding technicians or advanced producers, and some have taken on leadership positions in factories with hundreds of people. Li Fengming, the director of the Fuchun United Factory, was a housewife who rarely went to the streets a year ago. After she participated in the production of a chemical group, she led the housewives to work hard and master the technology of manufacturing ink and other chemical products. This chemical group has also developed into a United Factory that can produce bone glue, bone meal, sodium sulfate, calcium phosphate and many other important products. She was also rated as a national "March 8th Red Banner Pacesetter". The Jinma Paper Flower Factory, which was established by more than a dozen old, weak, deaf and mute women with three pairs of scissors, has now caught up with the national advanced level in the manufacture of silk flowers (including 44 varieties such as chrysanthemums, peach blossoms, and cherry blossoms). The products are sold abroad and are listed as high-quality products in Kunming City.

When organizing residents to participate in collective production, the commune-run industry in Kunming City also pays attention to adapting to people and local conditions, and the methods are flexible and diverse. The commune adopts the method of centralized production for women with better physical strength and fewer children, and adopts the method of unified management and decentralized production for older and weaker women, doing some lighter work such as pasting paper bags, pasting matchboxes, mounting cardboard, twisting hemp ropes, and spinning yarn. The time is also appropriately flexible, so that everyone with labor ability can participate in a production labor and life service work within their capacity. The Huashan Commune also organized more than 100 blind people who used to rely on relief to participate in the processing of medicinal materials suitable for blind people. This not only made the blind people self-reliant laborers, but also increased wealth for the country. Last year, the output value of this blind flour mill reached 1.52 million yuan, making it the factory with the highest output value in the Huashan Commune.

The result of the great development of the People's Communes industry in Kunming City has rapidly changed the spiritual outlook of the city and the vast number of residents, and the material living standards of the commune members have also been greatly improved.

    广大街道居民发扬“穷棒子”精神变消费者为生产者
    昆明城市公社跃为大工业得力助手
    据新华社昆明11日电　昆明市城市人民公社举办的工业，已经成为全市工业战线上一支重要的新生力量。从1958年以来，全市人民公社已办起小型工厂三百多个、生产小组九百多个，其中初具规模拥有百人以上的工厂已有近百个。在不到两年的时间中，全市社办工业的总产值有了很大增长。由于大办城市人民公社的结果，从城市居民中有八万多个劳动力参加了生产。其中有五万多个青壮年妇女已到大工业中工作。这个边疆春城的政治、经济和人民的精神面貌，在成立人民公社以后也发生了巨大的变化。
    昆明市区各人民公社举办的工业，坚持白手起家、因陋就简的“穷棒子”精神发展生产，一年多来生产有了飞跃的增长，1958年全市社办工业总产值为二千五百万元，1959年增长到一亿五千多万元，占全市工业总产值11％以上，预计今年可完成三亿五千万元。这些社办工业所用的大量原料，都是城市中的废弃物资和大工厂的边料、下脚料。如去年生产数十万把锁的盘龙制锁厂，全部原料都是利用大工厂的边料、废料。社办的盘龙电动工具厂，利用昆明电机厂制造电动机用的釸钢片的边料，作为制造电动工具的原料。据统计，全市社办工业自制的产品中，利用边角废料制造的占52％以上，修理服务性生产所需原料90％以上是靠废品回收解决的。
    昆明市各城市人民公社举办的工厂，已经成为大工业的得力助手，而且也为工业基础较差的昆明市生产了大量人民生活所需的产品。全市社办工业的产品中有85％是为大工业和人民生活服务的。社办工业为国营工厂加工了大量机器零件，还生产了大工厂所需要的大量锻件、螺丝、铆钉、土坯、氨水、石棉制品等产品。社办工业还大量生产了服装、鞋子、皮革、棉絮、日用五金、文具用品、家庭用具和药品等供应市场，商业部门用来包装商品的包装纸盒、纸袋等也大部依靠社办工业供应。
    昆明市各城市人民公社工业的从业人员中，有90％以上是职工家属和家庭妇女。她们在集体生产和集体生活的熔炉中，从消费者变为生产者，并逐步掌握了文化技术，已有不少家庭妇女成为出色的技术工人或先进生产者，有的在数百人的工厂里担任领导工作。富春联合工厂厂长李凤鸣，一年前还是连街都不大上的家庭妇女，她参加一个化工小组的生产以后，领导家庭妇女们刻苦钻研，掌握了制造墨水等化工产品的技术，这个化工小组也发展成为能生产骨胶、骨粉、硫酸钠、磷酸钙等许多重要产品的联合工厂，她也因而被评为全国的“三八红旗手”。由十多个老弱和聋哑妇女靠三把剪子成立起来的金马纸花厂，目前制造的绸花（包括菊花、桃花、樱花等四十四个品种）已赶上全国先进水平，产品运销国外，并被列为昆明市优等产品。
    昆明市社办工业在组织居民参加集体生产时，还注意了因人、因地制宜，方式灵活多样。公社对体力较好、孩子较少的妇女采取集中生产的办法，年龄较大、体力较弱的就采取统一管理分散生产的办法，做一些贴纸袋、糊火柴盒、裱纸板、打麻绳、纺纱线等比较轻的活，时间上也适当地灵活一些，这样就使所有有劳动能力的人都能参加一项力所能及的生产劳动和生活服务工作。华山公社还把一百多名过去靠救济度日的盲人也组织起来参加适合盲人劳动的药材加工生产，这样不仅使盲人成了自食其力的劳动者，而且也为国家增加了财富，去年这个盲人碾粉厂的产值即达一百五十二万元，成为华山公社产值最多的一个工厂。
    昆明市城市人民公社工业大发展的结果，迅速改变了城市和广大居民的精神面貌，社员的物质生活水平也有了很大提高。
