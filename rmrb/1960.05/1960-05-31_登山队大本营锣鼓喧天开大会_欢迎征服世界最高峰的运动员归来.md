Xinhua News Agency, Mount Everest, May 30th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Guo Chaoren reports from the mountaineering team's base camp, 5,120 meters above sea level below Mount Everest: Today, under Mount Everest, drums and gongs resounded, firecrackers boomed, bouquets and colorful flags waved, and cheers echoed through the clouds. All the staff at the mountaineering team's base camp, 5,120 meters above sea level, warmly welcomed the victorious return of the heroes who conquered Mount Everest.

　　In the early morning, when the Mount Everest area was still shrouded in milky white mist, a scene of jubilation appeared at the mountaineering team's base camp. A colorful "Triumphal Arch" was erected at the entrance to the camp, and huge banners reading "Welcome the Heroic Conquerors of Mount Everest to Return Victoriously" and "Salute to the Mountaineering Heroes" were posted on both sides. People dressed in festive attire, holding bouquets they had rushed to make overnight, waving colorful flags, and holding the colorful hydrogen balloons they had filled themselves, stood on the slopes of the Rongbuk River valley, waiting to welcome the mountaineering heroes back to the base camp from the first camp, 5,400 meters above sea level.

　　At 13:30 Beijing time, sports champion Wang Fuzhou, sports champion Qu Yinhua, first-class athlete Gonbu, and more than twenty mountaineers who reached over 8,100 meters, led by Xu Jing, deputy captain of the Chinese mountaineering team, appeared on the rocky beach of the valley. At this moment, the sound of gongs and drums, cheers, and firecrackers blended together in the welcoming crowd, and more than a hundred hydrogen balloons with various welcome slogans slowly rose into the clear sky, fluttering over the silver mountains of Mount Everest.

　　The mountaineers wore sky-blue high-mountain "storm suits," carried grass-green high-mountain backpacks, and held ice axes, marching in neat formation.

　　Deputy Captain Xu Jing, team members Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Gonbu walked at the front of the team. Although Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Gonbu had undergone nine days of arduous fighting to seize the main peak, their physical condition was good. The intense ultraviolet rays of the high mountains had darkened their skin, and their eyes revealed a bright spirit.

　　Han Futong, member of the National Sports Commission of China, who had recently rushed from Beijing to the base camp at the foot of the mountain, expressed a warm welcome to the mountaineers on behalf of the National Sports Commission.

　　Deputy Captain Xu Jing, on behalf of all the mountaineers, reported to Han Futong: "Under the correct leadership of the Party and the direct command of the National Sports Commission, the Chinese mountaineering team has successfully completed its mission. Now, all team members have safely returned to base camp." Han Futong replied: "Thanks to your brave and tenacious will and spirit of unity and mutual assistance, you have overcome the harsh natural conditions of Mount Everest and won honor for the motherland. I hope you will not be arrogant or rash, continue to work hard, and move forward forever!"

　　The jubilant crowd swarmed forward, offering flowers to the heroes, lifting them high, and singing and dancing back to the camp.

　　At 14:00 Beijing time, a grand welcoming meeting was held on the base camp square at the foot of Mount Everest. Sports champion Wang Fuzhou spoke at the meeting on behalf of the three team members who reached the summit. Wang Fuzhou said that after an extremely arduous battle, the three of them finally overcame the many natural obstacles of Mount Everest and brought the five-star red flag of the motherland and the plaster statue of Chairman Mao to the summit. With the help of our comrades-in-arms, we have now returned safely. He concluded by saying that Qu Yinhua, Gonbu, and himself are all in good health, and thanked the Party and the people of the motherland for their meticulous care.

    登山队大本营锣鼓喧天开大会
    欢迎征服世界最高峰的运动员归来
    新华社珠穆朗玛30日电　新华社记者郭超人从珠穆朗玛峰下拔海五千一百二十米登山队大本营报道：今天珠穆朗玛峰下，锣鼓喧天，爆竹轰鸣，花束和彩旗招展，欢呼声响彻云间。拔海五千一百二十米的登山队大本营的全体工作人员们，热烈地欢迎了征服珠穆朗玛峰的英雄们凯旋归来。
    清晨，珠穆朗玛山区上空还弥漫着乳白色的晓雾，登山队大本营营地上就出现了一片欢腾景象。在通向营地的路口上搭起了五彩缤纷的“凯旋门”，两旁张贴着“欢迎征服珠穆朗玛峰的英雄们胜利归来”和“向登山英雄们致敬”的巨幅标语。人们穿着节日的衣衫，捧着他们连夜赶做的花束，举着彩旗，拿着他们自己灌制的五颜六色的氢气球，站立在绒布河谷的山坡上，等待欢迎登山英雄们从拔海五千四百米的第一号营地返回大本营。
    北京时间十三点三十分，胜利登上珠穆朗玛峰的运动健将王富洲，运动健将屈银华，一级运动员贡布和二十几名到达八千一百米以上的登山运动员们一道，在中国登山队副队长许竞率领下，出现在河谷的乱石滩上。这时，欢迎的人群中锣鼓声、欢呼声和鞭炮声响成一片，一百多个氢气球带着各种欢迎标语徐徐升上晴空，在珠穆朗玛银色的山峦上飘扬。
    登山队员们穿着天蓝色的高山“冲锋衣裤”，背着草绿色的高山背包，扶着冰镐，排着整齐的队伍走来。
    副队长许竞，队员王富洲，屈银华和贡布走在队伍的最前面。王富洲，屈银华和贡布虽然经过了九天艰苦的夺取主峰的战斗，但是身体情况良好，高山强烈的紫外线使他们皮肤变得黝黑，他们的双眼里透露着奕奕的神采。
    不久前从北京赶到山下大本营的我国国家体育运动委员会委员韩复东，代表国家体委向登山队员们表示热烈的欢迎。
    副队长许竞代表全体登山队员向韩复东报告说：“中国登山队在党的正确领导下，在国家体委的直接指挥下，胜利地完成了任务。现在，全体队员已安全返回大本营。”韩复东回答说：“由于你们勇敢顽强的意志和团结互助的精神，战胜了珠穆朗玛峰恶劣的大自然条件，为祖国争得了荣誉。希望你们不骄不躁，继续努力，永远前进！”
    欢腾的人群蜂拥而上，为英雄们献花，把他们高高抬起来，边跳边唱回到营地。
    北京时间十四点，在珠穆朗玛峰下的大本营广场上举行了隆重的欢迎大会。运动健将王富洲代表登上顶峰的三名队员在大会上讲话。王富洲说，经过极其艰苦的战斗，我们三个人终于战胜了珠穆朗玛峰的重重天险，把祖国的五星红旗和毛主席的石膏像带上了峰顶。在战友们的援助下，现在，我们安全地返回了。他最后说，屈银华、贡布和我，身体都很健康，感谢党和祖国人民对我们无微不至的关怀。
