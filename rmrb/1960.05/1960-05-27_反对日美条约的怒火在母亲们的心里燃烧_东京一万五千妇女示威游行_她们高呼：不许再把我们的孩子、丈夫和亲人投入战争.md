    The Fire of Anger Against the U.S.-Japan Treaty Burns in Mothers' Hearts
    15,000 Women Demonstrate in Tokyo
    They Shout: No More Throwing Our Children, Husbands, and Relatives into War
    (Comprehensive Report) Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo: Japanese women held two large-scale demonstrations in Tokyo on the 25th under the slogans "Don't throw our children, our husbands, and our relatives into war again!", "Down with the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet!", and "Abolish the Security Treaty!"

    The demonstrating mothers held up large banners that read, "Nobusuke Kishi, don't send our children to the battlefield again!" Many mothers led their children, and gray-haired grandmothers also participated in the march. They held small placards demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

    At 6 p.m., 10,000 women held a protest rally in Shibuya Park, followed by a demonstration march toward Nobusuke Kishi's private residence. The rally was convened by women's groups led by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the Federation of Independent Unions.

    Prior to this, approximately 5,000 housewives with children, female school teachers, gray-haired elderly women, and female office workers held a rally in Shiba Park, Tokyo, demanding Nobusuke Kishi's resignation and the dissolution of the Diet. This rally was convened by the Japan Women's Association for the Defense of Human Rights.

    The rally passed a resolution demanding the dissolution of the Diet and the total resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet. Another resolution passed by the rally stated that Japanese women strongly oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan. The rally also unanimously passed an appeal calling on all Japanese women to take various forms of action to express their protest against the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet.

    After the rally, the women held a demonstration march toward the Diet. As they passed in front of the Shiba Post Office, many postal workers leaned out of the windows, waved red flags, and shouted encouragement to them. When they passed the government office buildings, civil servants on the roofs of some government buildings also waved red flags to the marching women in support.

    On the way, the demonstrating women held a rally in Hibiya Park, where they listened to reports from Socialist and Communist Party members of the Diet on the current political situation.

    In the afternoon, 150 female telephone operators and other female workers went to Nobusuke Kishi's residence. As Nobusuke Kishi was about to leave, they surrounded the car he was riding in and gave him 2,000 "Senninbari" cloths. Each cloth had 1,000 stitches sewn with colored thread. One stitch represents one person, and each person expresses their opposition to the new "Security Treaty" by sewing a stitch on the cloth. These "Senninbari" cloths were completed by the 170,000 members of the Electrical Communication Workers' Union after three months of effort.

    日本各界人民示威集会坚决要求解散国会
    反对日美条约的怒火在母亲们的心里燃烧
    东京一万五千妇女示威游行
    她们高呼：不许再把我们的孩子、丈夫和亲人投入战争
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯东京消息：日本妇女25日在“不要再把我们的孩子、我们的丈夫、我们的亲人投入战争！”“打倒岸信介内阁！”“废除安全条约！”的口号下，在东京举行了两次声势浩大的示威游行。
    示威游行的母亲们高举着大旗，上面写道“岸信介，不要再把我们的孩子送上战场！”许多母亲领着她们的孩子，白发苍苍的祖母们也参加了游行。她们拿着小标语牌，要求废除日美军事同盟条约。
    晚间六时，妇女一万人在涩谷公园举行了抗议大会，然后举行示威游行，向岸信介私人住宅前进。这次大会是由日本工会总评议会和中立工会联合会领导的妇女团体召集的。
    在这以前，大约五千名带着孩子的家庭主妇、学校女教师、白发苍苍的老妇人和办公室的女职员在东京芝公园举行大会，要求岸信介下台，并且解散国会。这个大会是由日本妇女保卫人权协议会召集的。
    大会通过决议，要求解散国会和岸信介内阁总辞职。大会通过的另一项决议说，日本妇女们强烈反对艾森豪威尔访问日本。大会还一致通过一项呼吁书，号召所有日本妇女采取各种形式的行动来表示她们对岸信介内阁的抗议。
    会后，妇女们举行示威游行，向国会前进。当她们经过芝邮政局前面时，邮局许多工作人员从窗口探身出来，挥动红旗，大声呼唤，鼓励她们。当她们经过政府办公处的时候，在一些政府办公楼的屋顶上也有公务员向游行的妇女挥舞红旗表示声援。
    途中示威的妇女在日比谷公园举行了大会，听取了社会党和共产党议员作关于目前政治形势的报告。
    下午，还有一百五十位女电话接线员和其他女工前往岸信介住宅，当时岸信介正要出门，她们包围了岸信介乘坐的汽车，交给他两千块“千人针”布。每块布上有用彩线缝的一千个针脚。一个针脚就代表一个人，每人就以在布上缝的一针来表示自己反对新“安全条约”。这些“千人针”布是电气通信工会的十七万会员经过三个月的努力所完成的。
