Technological Revolution Promotes Continuous Production Leaps
A Batch of Factories and Mines Complete Half of the Annual Plan Ahead of Schedule

    Thirty-five Factories in Xi'an City
    (Our Dispatch) With everyone working together and focusing on daily progress, as of May 19, 35 factories and enterprises in Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, including the Provincial Construction Machinery Factory, Xi'an Metal Structure Factory, Municipal Auto Parts Factory, Xi'an Boiler Factory, Xi'an Electric Motor Manufacturing Factory, Zhongxing Electric Motor Factory, Xin'an Clothing Factory, Afang District Red Flag Machinery Factory, Yanta District Electric Machinery Factory, Beilin District Instrument Electromechanical Repair Factory, Weiyang District Xinlian Hardware Factory, and Dazhong Wooden Box Factory, have completed half of their annual plans forty-two to fifty-two days ahead of schedule.
    Since the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the call to "Surpass April in May, make the second quarter better than the first, and strive to complete half of the annual plan in the first half of the year," leading cadres in these factories have gone to the front lines of production, focusing on the daily progress of production. Some units have formulated specific measures to ensure that progress is tracked at all times, accounts are settled every half-day, and inspections are conducted daily, effectively promoting the continuous increase of production targets.
    Now, the units that have completed half of their annual plans ahead of schedule are further revising their targets and proposing specific measures to ensure overproduction on top of overproduction. The Xi'an Metal Structure Factory has already completed more than 76% of its annual plan, and they have proposed a new goal: Ideological revolution first, major technological transformation, no increase in personnel, and striving to set up nine satellite factories by the end of the year for steelmaking, painting, oxygen stations, electrical appliances, small hardware, etc., with the goal of doubling the total output value.
    Three Special Zones in Hubei
    (Our Dispatch) Enshi, Xiangyang, and Jingzhou Special Zones in Hubei Province have completed the state plan for raw coal production for the first half of the year forty-one, forty, and forty-nine days ahead of schedule, respectively.
    Since the beginning of this year, the coal mines in these special zones have earnestly implemented the relevant instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the Regional Party Committees, adhered to the policy of running mines by the whole people, and fully utilized the advantages of the people's communes, organizing tens of thousands of farmers to invest in coal production during their slack farming season, and launched a mass movement to run commune-level coal mines on a large scale. After the steel battle centered on coal, iron, minerals, and transportation was launched, each special zone put forward the slogan of "Taking coal as the key link, seizing every minute and second, fighting hard in May and June, and completing the plan ahead of schedule," and organized working groups with the participation of leaders at all levels to go deep into the grassroots to solve key problems in production, such as ventilation, drainage, and transportation, while also arranging for the well-being of the workers.

It also met the requirements of the first half of the year's plan in terms of major varieties and product quality, while ensuring safe production.
    Since the beginning of the year, this factory has carried out technological innovation and technological revolution movements in the main form of "production sports meets." To date, the factory has achieved 966 technological innovation projects; 123 single-machine automation units; and 24 production linkage lines, increasing efficiency by one to thirty times and saving a large amount of labor.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang
    According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Nanchang on the 26th, the small coal mines in the Jiujiang Special Zone of Jiangxi Province had completed 56.9% of the annual raw coal production plan by the 15th.
    In order to seize high coal production and ensure the continued leap forward of steel, the coal mine workers in this special zone have universally carried out technological innovation and technological revolution movements since the beginning of this year. Fushan Coal Mine in De'an County has realized seven innovation projects, such as underground transportation cableway, steep slope transportation cable car, and ground transportation vehicle, increasing efficiency by three to four times, with the highest reaching twenty-two times. Recently, there has been a lot of rain, which has brought great difficulties to various mines. However, the workers are determined to compete with the water for coal and to seize high production in the rainy season. In order to deal with underground water inrush, the workers of Datian Coal Mine in Wuning County proposed 145 innovation suggestions, which not only ensured normal production in the rainy season, but also greatly increased the daily output by one time.
