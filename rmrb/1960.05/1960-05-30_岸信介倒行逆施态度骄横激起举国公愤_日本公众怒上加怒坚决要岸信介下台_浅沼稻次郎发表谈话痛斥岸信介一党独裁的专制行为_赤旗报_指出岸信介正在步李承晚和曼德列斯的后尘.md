Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th - Tokyo News: Japan Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma, commenting on Kishi Nobusuke's outrageous remarks this morning regarding the "Security Treaty," dissolution of the Diet, and resignation of the cabinet, accused Kishi Nobusuke of implementing a blatant one-party dictatorship.

Kishi Nobusuke said at a press conference this morning that he did not want to resign nor dissolve the Diet. He also attacked the people's demonstrations as a "collective violence that undermines democracy."

Asanuma warned that if Kishi Nobusuke continues to act in his old way, it will only anger the people. Asanuma emphasized, "The Socialist Party will concentrate its efforts to dissolve the Diet before June 18th. We will launch a huge wave of opposition to the Security Treaty and opposition to the Kishi Nobusuke movement to force Kishi Nobusuke, who lacks political conscience, to accept the will of the people."

Asanuma made these remarks in Okayama, where he is currently giving traveling speeches against the "Security Treaty."

The Democratic Socialist Party issued a statement this afternoon condemning Kishi Nobusuke's remarks. The statement pointed out that the current crisis was created by the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. The statement said, "Kishi Nobusuke's remarks make us more convinced than ever that the prerequisite for resolving the current political crisis is the resignation of the entire Kishi Cabinet."

Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), condemned Kishi Nobusuke's claim that petitioning the Diet was an "action by a few people."

He said, "In order to safeguard democratic politics, there is no other way to resolve the political situation than the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet."

Documentary film director Susumu Hani, after listening to Kishi Nobusuke's remarks, said, "Mr. Kishi said that the voices without sound support him, and he supposedly bases this judgment on letters received. Then, how does one explain the seventeen million petitions? Why doesn't Mr. Kishi look at the crowds protesting across the country?"

Hani pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's statement that dissolving the Diet now is equivalent to succumbing to violence is completely unconvincing. He questioned, "Isn't it dictatorial politics to turn a deaf ear to opinions unfavorable to oneself and not even hold elections when the situation is not suitable?"

Takenouchi Yoshimi, who protested against the Kishi Nobusuke government and resigned from his position as a professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University as a result, said that Prime Minister Kishi's idea of "passing" the new "Security Treaty" is a "dictator's mentality."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - Tokyo News: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," published an editorial today, severely condemning Kishi Nobusuke's arrogant statement expressing his refusal to resign.

The editorial said that Kishi Nobusuke attributed the current crisis to the attitude of the opposition parties. Kishi Nobusuke also said that "newspapers do not represent public opinion." He called the people's movement against the revised "Security Treaty" "violence." Kishi Nobusuke even said: "If he resigns now, it would be succumbing to 'violence.'"

The editorial said that this statement is considered his official response to the great People's Unified Action on May 26th. This poses a serious question to the people.

The editorial pointed out, "Kishi Nobusuke is demonstrating the typical attitude of politicians who, as agents of American imperialism, are trying every means to cling to power, ignoring the people's increasingly strong calls against them. Kishi Nobusuke is using bizarre logic incompatible with normal thinking to justify this attitude."

The editorial pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke said that if "violence" prevails, there will be no democracy. But he forgets that it is the violence used by Kishi Nobusuke and his assistants that has brought parliamentary democracy to the brink of destruction. Because he adopted violence and undermined democracy, the people are now demonstrating, demanding Kishi Nobusuke's resignation and demanding the dissolution of the Diet.

The editorial emphasized that, as the reporters pointed out during the conversation with Kishi Nobusuke, the May 26th demonstration was an expression of the anger of the broadest sections of the people, shared by all, against Kishi Nobusuke's actions, but Kishi Nobusuke said that only a few organized people held the demonstration.

The editorial further pointed out, "When Kishi Nobusuke said that all the people of Japan should warmly welcome President Eisenhower, he confessed that he intends to trample on the Japanese people for the benefit of the United States." The editorial finally emphasized, "Kishi Nobusuke is walking the path already taken by the fallen Syngman Rhee and Menderes."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - Tokyo News: Japanese public opinion unanimously condemns Kishi Nobusuke's fascist remarks made at the press conference on the 28th.

Kishi Nobusuke yesterday arrogantly stated that his cabinet would neither resign en masse nor dissolve the Diet, and would continue to force the Senate to pass the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

"Mainichi Shimbun" published an editorial today pointing out that, during the hour-and-a-half-long press conference, not a single word was heard from Kishi Nobusuke expressing remorse for causing the current situation. The editorial pointed out that, not only that, but Kishi Nobusuke also vainly attempted to "consult" with the Socialist Party and the Democratic Socialist Party to resolve the situation.

The newspaper emphasized that there is no second way to resolve the situation other than the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet resigning en masse and dissolving the Diet.

"Asahi Shimbun" denounced Kishi Nobusuke's fallacy that the current time is not the time to dissolve the Diet, and pointed out that the only way to do so at present is to dissolve the Diet to listen to the people's opinions.

"Yomiuri Shimbun" pointed out that the demand for the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet to step down comes not only from the demonstrations of workers and students, but also from broad public opinion, including the press.

The editorial pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's remarks at the press conference have made it clear that Kishi Nobusuke completely ignores the current demands of the absolute majority of public opinion.

Kyodo News published a commentary yesterday under the name of Ushijima Shunsaku, saying: "Prime Minister Kishi definitely said, 'The method of the Kishi Cabinet's collective resignation and dissolution of the Diet should not be adopted to resolve the situation.' This is contrary to the claims of the opposition parties and the wishes of the people. However, the people will not give up hope and will force Kishi Nobusuke to step down."

Ushijima refuted Kishi Nobusuke's argument at the press conference that Japanese newspapers do not represent fair public opinion. He said, "The fair public opinion that Prime Minister Kishi speaks of seems to mean only newspapers that support Kishi Nobusuke's claims. However, the only newspaper that can be seen to support Kishi Nobusuke's claims is the organ of the Liberal Democratic Party." He further pointed out:

"Even within the Liberal Democratic Party, there are forces opposed to Kishi Nobusuke."

Ushijima said: Kishi Nobusuke said, "The 'Security Treaty' should also be passed in the Senate at an appropriate time, but if the Liberal Democratic Party alone passes it in the Senate, the public's resentment will burn like fire because of this."

Mizutani Chozaburo, head of the Democratic Socialist Party's Diet members group, said yesterday: Kishi Nobusuke stated at the press conference that he is willing to resolve the political situation through "consultations" with the Socialist Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, but if the Liberal Democratic Party does not accept the invalidation of the resolution to announce the new "Security Treaty" and extend the Diet session and dissolve the House of Representatives, the Democratic Socialist Party cannot participate in the three-party summit.

At the same time, Mizutani Chozaburo believes that Suehiro Nishio's remarks in a radio talk with Kishi Nobusuke on the 26th, expressing his opinion that he could recognize the extension of the Diet and the passage of the new "Security Treaty" by the House of Representatives in some form depending on the circumstances, violated the party's decision. The Liberal Democratic Party's "anti-mainstream faction" is also deeply dissatisfied with Kishi Nobusuke's remarks at the press conference. According to "Mainichi Shimbun" today, the twenty-seven members belonging to the Miki-Matsumura faction unanimously agreed at a meeting held yesterday that Kishi Nobusuke did not show any remorse for his actions, so they must resolutely force him to step down.

According to "Tokyo Shimbun," both the Kono faction and the Ishibashi faction members expressed strong dissatisfaction with Kishi Nobusuke's conversation with reporters.

"Asahi Shimbun" said today that the Liberal Democratic Party's "anti-mainstream faction" will take a "power confrontation" attitude to deal with the "mainstream faction." In other words, the relationship between the two factions has entered a state of "confrontation."

    岸信介倒行逆施态度骄横激起举国公愤
    日本公众怒上加怒坚决要岸信介下台
    浅沼稻次郎发表谈话痛斥岸信介一党独裁的专制行为
    “赤旗报”指出岸信介正在步李承晚和曼德列斯的后尘
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎在评论岸信介今天上午就“安全条约”、解散国会和内阁辞职问题发表的横暴谈话时指责说，岸信介正在实行露骨一党独裁制度。
    岸信介今天上午在记者招待会上说，他不愿辞职，也不解散国会。他还攻击人民示威运动是一种“破坏民主的集体暴力”。
    浅沼警告说，如果岸信介继续按他的老方式干下去，那只会激怒人民。浅沼强调说，“社会党将集中力量来使国会在6月18日以前解散。我们将发动反对安全条约、反对岸信介运动的巨大浪潮，来迫使缺乏政治良心的岸信介接受人民的意志。”
    浅沼是在冈山发表这番谈话的，他现在正在那里进行反对“安全条约”的旅行演说。
    民主社会党今天下午发表声明，谴责岸信介的谈话。声明指出，制造目前危机的是岸信介内阁。声明说，“岸信介的谈话使我们比过去任何时候更加深信，解决目前政局危机的先决条件是岸内阁全体辞职。”
    日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章谴责岸信介所谓向国会请愿是“部分人的行动”的说法。
    他说，“为了维护民主政治，除了岸信介内阁下台和解散国会，来设法收拾政局以外，别无他法。”
    纪录电影导演羽仁进在听了岸信介的谈话以后说，“岸先生说，没有声音的呼声是支持他的，据说他这个判断的根据是收到了信。那么，一千七百万封请愿书怎么解释呢？岸先生为什么不看一看目前在全国表示抗议的人群呢？”
    羽仁进指出，岸信介说现在解散国会等于屈服于暴力，这种说法完全没有说服力。他质问，“对于不利于自己的意见掩住耳朵不听，情况不合适的时候连选举也不举行。这样，岂不是独裁政治吗？”
    曾向岸信介政府表示抗议并因此而辞去东京都立大学教授职务的竹内好说，岸首相想“通过”新“安全条约”的想法是“独裁者的心理”。
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，严厉谴责岸信介发表的表示不辞职的傲慢声明。
    社论说，岸信介把目前的危机归咎于反对党的态度。岸信介还说什么“报纸不代表公众舆论”。他把人民反对经过修改的“安全条约”的运动称为是“暴力”。岸信介甚至说：“如果他现在辞职，那将是向‘暴力’屈服”。
    社论说，这项声明被认为是他对5月26日伟大的人民统一行动的正式答复。这样就对人民提出了严重的问题。
    社论指出，“岸信介表现出这样一些政客的典型态度：他们作为美帝国主义者的代理人，想尽办法死抱住政权不放，而无视人民反对他们的日益强烈的呼声。岸信介为了替这种态度辩解，正在使用同正常的想法不相容的离奇的逻辑。”
    社论指出，岸信介说，如果“暴力”得势，就不会有民主。但是他忘记了：是岸信介和他的助手所使用的暴力，把议会民主带到了毁灭的边缘。由于他采用暴力和破坏民主，因此人民现在示威，要求岸信介辞职并要求解散国会。
    社论强调说，正如记者们在同岸信介谈话时所指出的，5月26日示威，是最广泛的人民阶层所共有的对岸信介行为的愤怒的表示，而岸信介却说，只有一部分有组织的人举行示威。
    社论又指出，“当岸信介说日本全体人民应当对艾森豪威尔总统表示热烈欢迎时，他供认了他打算使为了美国的利益而践踏日本人民。”社论最后强调指出，“岸信介正在走已经垮台的李承晚和曼德列斯走过的道路。”
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本舆论一致声讨岸信介28日在记者招待会上发表的法西斯言论。
    岸信介昨天蛮横地表示，他的内阁既不全体辞职，也不解散国会，而且还要继续强使参议院通过新日美“安全条约”。
    “每日新闻”今天发表社论指出，在历时一个半小时的记者招待会上，连一句也没听到岸信介对造成目前局势表示悔悟的话。社论指出，不仅如此，岸信介还妄想同社会党、民主社会党共同“协商”来收拾局势。
    这家报纸强调指出，除了岸信介内阁全体辞职和解散国会以外，没有收拾局势的第二条道路。
    “朝日新闻”痛斥岸信介关于目前不是解散国会的时期的谬论，并且指出，在目前只有解散国会来听取人民的意见才是办法。
    “读卖新闻”指出，要求岸信介内阁下台的不仅是工人和学生的示威游行队伍，而且是包括新闻界在内的广泛社会舆论。
    社论指出，岸信介在记者招待会上的这番谈话，已经使人们明白了岸信介完全忽视绝对多数舆论的当前要求。
    共同社在昨天发表了署名牛岛俊作的评论说：“岸首相肯定说，‘不应该采取岸内阁总辞职、解散国会的办法来收拾局势’。这是违背在野党的主张和国民的希望。但是，国民不会抛弃希望，而会迫使岸信介下台”。
    牛岛驳斥了岸信介在记者招待会上说日本报纸没有代表公正舆论的论调。他说：“岸首相所说的公正舆论，似乎意味着只是拥护岸信介的主张的报纸。然而，所能看到的主张拥护岸信介的报纸只有自由民主党的机关报”。他进一步指出：
  “即使在自由民主党内部也有反对岸信介的势力”。
    牛岛说：岸信介说“在适当的时期，在参议院也应该通过‘安全条约’，但是，如果形成自由民主党单独在参议院通过的话，国民的反感将因此而像火一样地燃烧起来”。
    民主社会党国会议员团团长水谷长三郎昨天说：岸信介在记者招待会上表示，愿意通过同社会党、民主社会党“协商”来收拾政局，但是，如果自由民主党不接受宣布新“安全条约”的表决和延长国会会期的决议无效和解散众议院这些前提条件，民主社会党就不能参加三党首脑会谈。
    水谷长三郎同时认为，西尾末广26日在同岸信介发表广播谈话表示可以根据情况对延长国会和众议院通过新“安全条约”予以某种形式的承认的意见，是违反党的决定的。自由民主党“反主流派”也对岸信介在记者招待会上的谈话深为不满。据“每日新闻”今天报道，属于三木—松村派的二十七名议员在昨天举行的会议上一致认为，岸信介并没有对自己的行为表示反省，因此要坚决迫使他下台。
    据“东京新闻”报道，河野派和石桥派议员都对岸信介对记者的谈话表示强烈的不满。
      “朝日新闻”今天说，自由民主党“反主流派”将采取“实力对抗”的态度，来对付“主流派”。换句话说，这两派之间的关系已经进入“交锋”状态。
