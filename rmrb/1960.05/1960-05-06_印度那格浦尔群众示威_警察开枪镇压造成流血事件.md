Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 5th: Disturbances have occurred in Nagpur, in the newly formed Indian state of Maharashtra, for the past few days.

According to the Press Trust of India, 20,000 people demonstrated on May 1st to oppose the inclusion of Vidarbha into the newly formed Maharashtra state. Demonstrators burned a police car and a post office, and also attempted to break into granaries. Authorities dispatched police and used tear gas. It is reported that eighty people were injured.

According to today's "Hindustan Times," demonstrations continued in several parts of Nagpur city on May 2nd and 3rd. Police opened fire on demonstrators on May 2nd and 3rd, injuring dozens. So far, police have arrested 800 people, including 136 on May 4th alone.

It is reported that demonstrations have occurred in eight districts of Maharashtra. News reports state that a 48-hour curfew has been imposed in seventeen areas of Nagpur city since the night of May 2nd. As of the 4th, the curfew in fifteen other areas was extended for another 24 hours.

It is reported that the unrest began on April 27th. Some members of the Congress Party demanded that eight districts formerly belonging to Bombay State be formed into a state called Vidarbha, opposing the inclusion of these areas into the Maharashtra state formed along single Marathi language lines.

The Press Trust of India also reported that a twenty-day long demonstration was held in Imphal, Manipur, demanding the election of a Manipur State Assembly to replace the "dictatorial rule" of the Administrative Commissioner, who the demonstrators said represents the central government to govern the state. Police opened fire on demonstrators on April 25th. Local shops and entertainment venues held strikes to protest the police shooting.

    印度那格浦尔群众示威
    警察开枪镇压造成流血事件
    新华社新德里5日电　在印度新成立的马哈拉施特拉邦的那格浦尔，最近几天中连续发生骚动。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，5月1日有二万人举行示威，反对把维达尔巴划入新成立的马哈拉施特拉邦。示威者烧毁了一辆警车、一所邮局，示威者还企图打开粮仓。当局曾出动警察，施放催泪瓦斯，据报道有八十人受伤。
    据“印度斯坦时报”今天消息，5月2日、3日在那格浦尔市的几个地方继续发生示威事件。警察曾经在5月2日和3日向示威者开枪，受伤的有几十人。到目前为止，警察已经逮捕了八百人，其中在5月4日那天就逮捕了一百三十六人。
    据报道，马哈拉施特拉邦有八个县都发生了示威。消息说，自从5月2日夜间以来，在那格浦尔市十七个地区实行了四十八小时的宵禁。到4日为止，还有十五个地区要延长宵禁时间二十四小时。
    据报道，这次动乱是从4月27日开始的。一部分国大党人要求把原属孟买邦的八个县成立一个叫做维达尔巴的邦，反对把这些地方划入按单一的马拉地语言成立的马哈拉施特拉邦。
    印度报业托辣斯还报道，在曼尼普尔邦英帕尔也举行了历时二十天之久的示威，要求选举曼尼普尔邦议会来代替示威者所说的代表中央政府来管辖这个邦的行政专员的“独裁统治”。警察曾经在4月25日对示威者开枪射击，当地商店和娱乐场所都举行罢市，以抗议警察开枪事件。
