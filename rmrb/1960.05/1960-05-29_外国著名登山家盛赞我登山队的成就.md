Xinhua News Agency, May 28th - Foreign renowned mountaineers have lauded the Chinese mountaineering team for completing the human first ascent of the world's highest peak, Mount Everest, via its north face.

    Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand, who first ascended Mount Everest via its south face in 1953, said in Auckland on May 27th upon learning the news, "Well done, the Chinese team." He added, "I am very curious to know how they climbed the last thousand feet. That is the key to this climb, and in my opinion, it is very steep."

    Norgay, the guide who accompanied Hillary on the 1953 ascent, congratulated the Chinese mountaineering team in New Delhi on May 27th for ascending the mountain from the difficult north face.

    Max Eiselin, the leader of the Swiss climbing team that recently announced the successful conquest of Dhaulagiri Peak (26,795 feet, or approximately 8,167 meters above sea level) on May 13th, said in Kathmandu on May 27th that the success of the Chinese mountaineering team was "a great achievement." He expressed surprise at this achievement, saying: "I have always believed that the Chinese would one day climb this mountain, but I never thought they would climb it so quickly."

    Eiselin said: "This shows that Chinese mountaineering is developing at a high speed."

    外国著名登山家盛赞我登山队的成就
    新华社28日讯　外国著名登山家盛赞中国登山队完成人类第一次沿珠穆朗玛峰北坡登上这个世界第一高峰的顶峰的壮举。
    1953年沿珠穆朗玛南坡，第一次登上珠穆朗玛峰顶峰的新西兰人埃德蒙德·希拉里爵士27日在奥克兰知道这个消息后说，中国队“干得好极了”。他说，我很想知道他们如何爬上最后一千英尺的。这是这次爬山的关键，在我看来，是非常陡峭的。
    在1953年陪同希拉里攀登这个山峰的向导诺盖27日在新德里表示祝贺中国登山队从困难的北坡登上山峰。
    最近宣布在5月13日征服拔海二万六千七百九十五英尺（约八千一百六十七米）的道拉格里峰成功的瑞士爬山队队长马克斯·埃斯森，27日在加德满都说，中国登山队的成功是“一个伟大的成就”。他对这个成就感到惊奇，他说：我一直相信中国人总会有一天爬上这个山峰，但是我从未想到他们会那样快就爬上去。
    坡斯森说：“这说明中国的登山运动有了高速度的发展。”
