Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 9th: The full text of Prince Sihanouk of the Kingdom of Cambodia's speech at Phnom Penh Airport on the morning of May 9th to bid farewell to Premier Zhou Enlai is as follows:

    Mr. Premier,
    As your visit to our country comes to an end, I cannot fully express my feelings of reluctance to part and my excitement, which are the feelings of the entire Cambodian people. Mr. Premier, during these wonderful days, you have felt the heart of the entire nation beat for you and for the entire Chinese people. This is the most tremendous success achieved by a statesman in our country, and it has forever established the friendship that binds us together.

    The fraternal affection so warmly expressed by all the people of our country, we find its roots not only in the past millennia but also in the very harmonious co-existence of Cambodians and Chinese living together on our land. I am pleased to take this opportunity to emphasize how satisfied we are with the attitude of the Chinese expatriates in Cambodia. The Chinese expatriates faithfully abide by our laws and our policy of neutrality and consciously participate in the development work of our country.

    Mr. Premier, the warm welcome of the Khmer people shows you that they are sincerely pleased to see China, like Cambodia, faithfully defending our common ideals of peace, justice, and independence. This unity of ideals, which has been reaffirmed in the joint statement just signed, confirms that the friendship, which has never seen dispute, is very solid. Mr. Premier, allow me to express to you here our extreme satisfaction at seeing this new joint statement confirming the unreserved support of the Chinese nation for small, peaceful countries facing the scourge of imperialist and annexationist conspiracies. On the Cambodian side, it will therefore have more confidence in its future and the virtues of peaceful coexistence.

    In fact, we are absolutely convinced that friendship and harmonious cooperation between China and Cambodia, with strict respect for each other's systems and institutions, are particularly beneficial to Asian peace. I dare say that the relationship between our two countries is an example and an encouragement to the peoples and nations that are wholeheartedly devoted to seeking their own happiness and prosperity and are steadfastly striving for peace.

    Mr. Premier, Mr. Marshal, esteemed representatives and dear friends, please allow me once again to express the gratitude of Cambodia and the Cambodian people for China's invaluable and selfless assistance, which now and in the future will help to fully complete our national construction endeavors. We fully appreciate the value of the sacrifices made by the entire Chinese people, who are undergoing the most amazing economic revolution in the world, in order to provide us with this assistance.

    On behalf of the Royal Government and the Cambodian people, I extend to you, Mr. Premier, Mr. Marshal, esteemed representatives, and through you to the admirable Chinese people, our sincerest congratulations and wish you complete victory. The great cause you are undertaking will now and in the future amaze the world and our descendants.

    Finally, please allow me to ask you to convey our respect and wishes to the great leaders of New China, Chairman Mao Zedong and President Liu Shaoqi.

    Long live Premier Zhou Enlai and Marshal Chen Yi!
    Long live the People's China!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between Cambodia and China!

    西哈努克亲王的讲话
    新华社金边9日电　柬埔寨王国西哈努克亲王9日上午在金边机场欢送周恩来总理的讲话，全文如下：总理先生
  在您对我国的访问结束的时候，我无法充分表达我的惜别之情和我的激动，这是柬埔寨全体人民的感情。总理先生，在这几天美好的日子里，您感觉到整个民族的心为您和为全体中国人民而跳跃。这是一位政治家在我国所取得的最为巨大的成功，它永远地确立了把我们连结在一起的友谊。
    我国全体人民这样热烈地表达的这种亲如兄弟的感情，我们发现它的根源不仅仅在于长达千年的过去，而且也在于在我国土地上一起生活的柬埔寨人和中国人十分融洽的相处。我高兴地趁此机会强调指出，我们对于在柬埔寨的中国侨民的态度是多么满意。中国侨民忠实地遵守我们的各项法律和我们的中立政策，并且自觉地参加我们国家的发展工作。
    总理先生，高棉人民的热烈欢迎向您表明，他们看到中国像柬埔寨一样忠实地捍卫着我们共同的和平、正义和独立的理想而感到衷心地高兴。这种理想的一致，在刚刚签订的联合声明中，已予以重申，联合声明证实了从来没有出现过争执的友谊非常巩固。总理先生，请允许我在此向您表示，我们极为满意地看到这项新的联合声明证实了中华民族无保留的支持面临帝国主义者和并吞主义者的阴谋的祸害的和平小国。在柬埔寨方面，它将因而对自己的前途和和平共处的品德更有信心。
    事实上，我们绝对确信，中国和柬埔寨之间，在严格尊重彼此的制度和体制的情况下的友谊和和谐合作，对亚洲和平特别有利。我敢断言，我们两国之间的关系，对于一心一意致力于谋求自己的幸福和繁荣而坚定不移地争取和平的各国人民和国家，是一个范例和一种鼓舞。
    总理先生，元帅先生，尊敬的代表们和亲爱的朋友们，请允许我再一次向你们表示柬埔寨和柬埔寨人民对中国的如此可贵和如此无私的援助表示感激，这种援助现在和将来将有助于充分完成我们的国家建设事业。我们完全体会到正在进行世界上史无前例的最惊人的经济革命的全体中国人民，为了向我们提供这种援助而作出的牺牲的价值。
    我谨以王国政府和柬埔寨人民的名义，向您，总理先生、元帅先生、尊敬的代表们，并通过你们向可钦佩的中国人民，表示我们最诚挚的祝贺，祝你们获得全面的胜利。你们所进行的巨大事业现在和今后都将引起全世界和我们的后代的惊异。
    最后请允许我请您向新中国的伟大领袖们，毛泽东主席和共和国主席刘少奇阁下转达我们的敬意和祝愿。
    周恩来总理和陈毅元帅万岁！
    人民中国万岁！
    柬埔寨和中国之间的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
