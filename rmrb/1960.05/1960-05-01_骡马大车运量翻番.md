The workers of the Yinchuan City Rubber-wheeled Cart Transportation Company boldly innovated folk animal-powered transportation tools and successively trial-produced fifteen four-wheeled horse carts, three-wheeled horse carts, six-wheeled donkey carts and various trailers, enabling the weight pulled by mules and horses to rapidly increase from 0.66 tons per animal to 1-2 tons; the weight pulled by male mules increased from 0.3 tons per animal to 1 ton; the load capacity of each horse cart increased from 2 tons to 4-8 tons; and the load capacity of each donkey cart increased from 0.3 tons to 2 tons.
