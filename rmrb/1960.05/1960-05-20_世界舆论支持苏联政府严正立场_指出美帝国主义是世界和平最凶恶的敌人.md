    World Opinion Supports the Soviet Government's Solemn Stance
    Pointing Out that U.S. Imperialism is the Most Ferocious Enemy of World Peace
    Socialist Countries' Public Opinion Says
    We Must Constantly Strike at Peace-Breakers
    (Comprehensive report by our newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: Public opinion in various countries warmly supports Khrushchev's statement and condemns the United States for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.
    The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published an editorial on the 17th, saying that Khrushchev's statement condemned the warmongers. The Albanian people unanimously support Khrushchev's statement.
    The Bulgarian newspaper "Workers' Cause" said in its editorial on the 18th that the aggressive policy announced by the U.S. government as a national policy is incompatible with the vital interests of the people of all countries, and this policy is doomed to complete bankruptcy.
    The Hungarian newspaper "People's Freedom" wrote on the 18th that the United States must bear serious responsibility for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.
    The Polish newspaper "People's Tribune" published an editorial on the 18th, saying that the U.S. government undermined the most basic conditions for holding negotiations between representatives of various countries, namely, the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty, equality, and goodwill.
    The Romanian newspaper "Spark" published an editorial on the 18th, saying that the incident of U.S. aircraft violating Soviet airspace was a conspiracy against the summit conference.
    The Czechoslovak newspaper "Red Rights" published a commentary saying that the United States had sabotaged the summit conference. The commentary emphasized that vigilance must be constantly maintained to expose the destroyers of peace and to strike them again and again.
    Asian Countries' Public Opinion Says
    The Soviet Position is Beneficial to World Peace
    The Japanese Peace Committee issued a statement on the 19th, pointing out: "The direct responsibility for the failure of the summit conference lies with the provocative espionage flights conducted by U-2 aircraft over Soviet territory and the aggressive and adventurous policies of the United States revealed in Eisenhower's subsequent statement and the U.S. note to the Soviet Union."
    Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, published an article in the "Sankei Shimbun" on the 19th, pointing out that the U.S. U-2 aircraft's violation of Soviet airspace is directly responsible for the failure of the summit conference. Asanuma said that from the U.S. government's statement that it does not intend to stop espionage activities, it can be seen that the United States intends to continue to implement its Cold War policy.
    Saburo Eda, Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party, said at a press conference on the 18th, "We regret that the summit conference has broken down due to the attitude adopted by the United States."
    Yuichi Kobayashi, Chairman of the Japan Congress of Journalists, pointed out that now, after the discovery of U.S. spy planes invading the Soviet Union to conduct reconnaissance activities, the United States still has not repented, and this attitude is intolerable to the Soviet Union.
    The Indonesian "People's Daily" said on the 19th that the failure of the summit conference was due to the U.S. U-2 aircraft's arrogant intrusion into Soviet airspace, or in other words, the United States carried out an act of aggression.
    The Iraqi newspaper "People's Solidarity" said in its editorial on the 18th, "The people of all countries hope that the summit conference will safeguard world peace, rather than cover up the warlike and aggressive actions that the United States has consistently taken in violation of the interests and desires of the people of all countries." The editorial said that the Soviet position smashed the masks that some people used to cover up the truth.
    The Lebanese newspaper "Call" published editorials and articles on the 17th and 18th successively, expressing full support for Khrushchev's demands on the United States regarding the aircraft incident, and said, "These are very reasonable demands based on the interests of the Soviet Union and the interests of world peace."
    Latin American and Australian Public Opinion Says
    The Soviet Union Rebuked the Warmongers
    The Cuban newspaper "Today" published an editorial pointing out that "Eisenhower, Nixon, Herter, and the madmen of the Pentagon not only admitted to aerial espionage activities against the Soviet Union, but also stubbornly argued that such activities were necessary, thus making any beneficial talks impossible."
    The Argentine weekly "Action" commented on the summit conference, saying that Khrushchev's solemn preconditions for convening the conference were completely justified.
    The commentary said that Khrushchev's rebuke can play a role in deterring the warmongers.
    The Uruguayan newspaper "People's Paper" revealed that the clamor launched by the imperialist press on the issue of the Four-Power Summit Conference was to "cover up the serious provocations of the United States against the summit conference and shift the responsibility of the United States to the Soviet Union."
    The editorial published by "Last Hour" said, "It is worth pointing out the historical fact that after the aircraft incident, from Eisenhower to Herter, they insisted that espionage flights would continue as an 'unfortunate necessity.' In the world, no self-respecting country would use such language and abuse its power."
    The Australian Communist Party's organ "Tribune" weekly, when mentioning the situation of the Four-Power Summit Conference, said that Khrushchev's proposal opened the way for a genuine summit conference, "a genuine summit conference that can be held whenever the U.S. government decides, either now or in the future, to respect the borders of other countries and agree to peaceful coexistence."
    Progressive Public Opinion in European Countries Says
    We Must Combat the U.S. Policy of Provocation
    The Political Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on the 18th, pointing out that the United States must be held responsible for the failure of the Paris East-West Four-Power Summit Conference.
    The statement asked: "How can a conference to end the Cold War be held when the United States takes such actions and expresses its determination to maintain the Cold War by aggressive actions, violating Soviet airspace and violating international law?" The statement said that Macmillan's refusal to "guarantee that British bases will not be used for such purposes and also not to prohibit such flights from British bases, this attitude encourages the madmen of the Pentagon."
    Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, told workers at the Vitry-sur-Seine Pen factory on the evening of the 18th that the people of all countries are watching with anger as the U.S. militarist clique undermines this conference. The fact that a U.S. spy plane violated Soviet airspace proves that these people have not abandoned the policy of "strength" and have not abandoned the policy of "brink of war" that former Secretary of State Dulles spoke of.
    Thorez accused the U.S. President, the French President, and the British Prime Minister of trying to shift the responsibility for postponing the meeting to the country that suffered from their intolerable means.
    The Norwegian Communist Party's organ "Freedom" published an editorial on the 18th, saying that the Four-Power Summit Conference should have had such a clear premise: the conference should be conducted in an atmosphere of mutual trust with assurances to prevent provocations. However, this basic rule was undermined by the U.S. government in an extremely bad way on the eve of the conference. The editorial pointed out that the provocative policy of the U.S. government should be condemned, which makes it impossible for people to believe the "peaceful wishes" that the United States often expresses. It is now clear that this provocative policy of the United States must be thoroughly combated.

    阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”17日发表社论说，赫鲁晓夫的声明谴责了战争挑拨者。阿尔巴尼亚人民一致支持赫鲁晓夫的声明。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”18日的社论说，美国政府宣布为国策的侵略政策同各国人民的切身利益是不相容的，这个政策注定要完全破产。
    匈牙利“人民自由报”18日写道，美国要对破坏四国首脑会议负严重的责任。
    波兰“人民论坛报”18日发表编辑部文章说，美国政府破坏了各国代表之间举行谈判的最起码的条件，即相互尊重主权、平等和善意的原则。

    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”发表评论说，美国破坏了首脑会议，评论强调说，要不断保持警惕，揭露和平的破坏者，并一而再、再而三地给他们以打击。
    亚洲各国公众舆论说
    苏联立场有利世界和平
    日本和平委员会19日发表声明指出：“对最高级会议的失败要负直接责任的是U—2型飞机在苏联领土上空进行的挑衅性间谍飞行以及在艾森豪威尔接着发表的声明和美国致苏联照会中透露的美国的侵略性冒险政策。”
    日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎19日在“产经新闻”上发表文章指出，美国U—2型飞机侵犯苏联领空应对最高级会议未能开成负直接责任。浅沼稻次郎说，从美国政府说它不打算停止间谍活动的声明中，就可看出美国要继续执行冷战政策的意图。
    日本社会党书记长江田三郎18日在记者招待会上说，“我们感到遗憾，最高级会议由于美国所采取的态度而破裂”。
    日本记者会议议长小林雄一指出，现在，在美国间谍飞机侵犯苏联从事侦察活动被发现后，美国仍然没有改悔，这种态度是苏联所不能容忍的。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”19日说，最高级会议未能开成是由于美国U—2型飞机专横地侵入苏联领空，换句话说是，美国进行了侵略活动。
    伊拉克“人民团结报”18日发表的社论说，“各国人民都希望最高级会议维护世界和平，而不是掩盖美国违反世界各国人民的利益和愿望而一贯采取的好战的侵略行动。”社论说，苏联的立场把某些人用以遮盖事实真相的假面具砸得稀烂。
    黎巴嫩“呼声报”17日、18日连续发表社论和文章表示全力支持赫鲁晓夫在飞机事件上对美国提出的要求，并且说，“这些是出自苏联利益和世界和平利益的非常合理的要求。”
    拉丁美洲澳洲舆论说
    苏联训诫了战争贩子
    古巴“今日报”发表社论指出，“艾森豪威尔、尼克松、赫脱和五角大楼的狂人不仅承认了对苏联的空中间谍活动，而且顽固地辩解，说什么这种活动是必要的，这样就使得任何有益的会谈都成为不可能”。
    阿根廷“行动”周刊就最高级会议发表评论说，赫鲁晓夫对召开会议提出的郑重的先决条件是完全应该的。
    评论说，赫鲁晓夫这次训诫，能起制止战争贩子的作用。
    乌拉圭报纸“人民报”揭露帝国主义报刊就四国首脑会议问题发起的叫嚣是为了“掩盖美国对首脑会议的严重挑衅和把美国的责任推到苏联身上”。
    “最后一点钟报”发表的社论说，“值得指出这样一个历史事实：在发生飞机事件后，从艾森豪威尔到赫脱都坚持说，间谍飞行将作为‘不幸的必要’继续进行下去。在世界上，没有任何一个自重的国家会使用这种语言和滥用权力。”
    澳大利亚共产党机关报“论坛”周报在提到四国首脑会议的情况时说，赫鲁晓夫的建议为真正的最高级会议开辟了道路，“这种真正的最高级会议能够在无论现在或将来美国政府决定尊重其他国家的边界和同意和平共处时举行”。
    欧洲国家进步舆论说   
    必须打击美国挑衅政策
    英国共产党政治委员会18日发表声明指出，美国必须对巴黎东西方四国首脑会议未能开成负责。
    声明问道：“在美国采取这样的行动，并且表示它决心用侵略行动，侵犯苏联领空和违反国际法来保持冷战的情况下，怎么能举行结束冷战的会议呢？”声明说，麦克米伦拒绝“保证英国的基地不被用于这种用途，并且也不禁止从英国基地起飞的这种飞行，这种态度鼓励了五角大楼的狂人”。
    法国共产党总书记莫里斯·多列士18日晚上在维特里罗尼普伦工厂向工人们讲话说，各国人民怀着愤怒的心情看到美国军国主义集团破坏了这次会议。美国间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空的这一事实，证明了这些人还没有放弃“实力”政策，没有放弃故国务卿杜勒斯所说的“战争边缘”政策。
    多列士指责美国总统、法国总统和英国首相竭力要把会议推迟的责任推给遭受他们不能容许的手段之害的国家。
    挪威共产党机关报“自由报”18日发表社论说，四国政府首脑会议本来应该有这样一个明确的前提：会议应该在提出防止挑衅的保证的相互信任的气氛中进行。但是，这种基本的规则却被美国政府在会议召开前夕以极为恶劣的方式破坏了。社论指出，美国政府的挑衅政策应该受到谴责，它使人们不可能相信美国经常表示的“和平愿望”。现在很清楚，必须彻底打击美国这种挑衅政策。
