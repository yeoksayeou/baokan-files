Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 23rd: Seoul dispatch: Workers in Seoul and Busan, South Korea, have been holding strikes and demonstrations for days, striving to improve working conditions and living standards.

According to a broadcast by Busan Cultural Broadcasting Station, more than 2,600 workers in over 40 clothing factories in the Busan area held a general strike on the 21st, demanding that they sign a new collective contract with the capitalists. These workers had already fought for this demand last year. The capitalists pretended to agree to the workers' demands but signed a contract stipulating that wage issues would be "completely decided by the business owner." This aroused the workers' anger.

According to a broadcast by Seoul Broadcasting Station, 370 workers on the bus line between Seoul and Sinchon held a five-hour demonstration on the afternoon of the 22nd, demanding that the capitalists improve working conditions. To implement their demands, the workers decided to work only eight hours a day starting on the 23rd. Before this, bus workers in Seoul and other parts of South Korea generally worked as long as eighteen hours a day.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 23rd: Seoul dispatch: Farmers and students in Daejeon, Daegu, and other places in South Korea continue to launch struggles against the puppet authorities and to expel the American and Rhee Syngman special agents.

According to a broadcast by Daejeon Broadcasting Station, forty farmer representatives in Daejeon City held a sit-in demonstration in the offices of the Daejeon "Mayor" and "Deputy Mayor" on the 20th and 21st, opposing the Daejeon pseudo-municipal authorities' act of forcibly seizing farmers' cultivated land under the pretext of "park land" and then selling it to speculators.

According to a broadcast by Daegu Broadcasting Station, more than 1,000 students from Daegu Kwangbuk Girls' High School gathered at the school on the 21st, demanding the resignation of the American and Rhee Syngman special agent Principal Kwon Sang-cheol and School Supervisor Choi Myung-joo. The students revealed Kwon Sang-cheol's and Choi Myung-joo's despicable acts of colluding with Rhee Syngman's Liberal Party and embezzling the tuition and miscellaneous fees paid by the students. Kwon Sang-cheol and Choi Myung-joo were forced to express their agreement to resign in front of the students.

Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: Ankara dispatch: The Turkish Menderes fascist government continues to intensify its frantic suppression of the people's struggle against its traitorous and dictatorial rule. On the 22nd, after announcing the implementation of extended curfew hours, the Menderes government ordered all universities and colleges nationwide to suspend classes that evening.

After Turkish students held a demonstration against the Menderes government on April 28th, the Menderes government had already ordered the suspension of classes in higher education institutions in the capital Ankara and the largest city, Istanbul, for one month. According to the new order on the 22nd, all higher education institutions in Turkey will be closed until the start of the fall semester. The term examinations originally scheduled to begin on June 10th have been postponed to October.

In the large-scale demonstration struggle launched by the Turkish people against the US-backed Menderes traitorous government in the past three weeks, Turkish youth and students have consistently stood at the forefront.

The new suppression measures announced by the Menderes government on the 22nd are extremely brutal and also reflect its extreme panic over popular resistance. This dictatorial government not only extended the curfew hours, prohibited any demonstrations, and threatened to use force against any demonstrations, but it also prohibited all wedding and funeral ceremonies, stipulated that only single lines are allowed when queuing in cinemas, theaters, bus stations, or other public places, and prohibited residents from approaching any military buildings. It also openly announced that it would eavesdrop on telephone calls between the capital Ankara and other places as part of the strict inspection of all communications and suppression measures.

    坚决争取改善劳动条件和生活待遇
    南朝鲜两千多工人罢工示威
    土耳其反动派害怕人民示威勒令全国高等学校停课
    新华社平壤23日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜汉城和釜山的工人连日举行罢工和示威，争取改善劳动条件和生活待遇。
    据釜山文化广播电台广播，在釜山地区的四十多个被服工厂的二千六百多工人21日举行了总罢工，要求同资方签订新的集体合同。这些工人在去年就为这个要求进行斗争。资方假装答应工人的要求，但是却签订了一个规定对工资问题“完全由企业主决定”的合同。这激起了工人们的愤怒。
    据汉城广播电台广播，22日下午汉城同新村间的公共汽车线路上的三百七十名工人举行了五小时的示威，要求资方改善劳动条件。工人们为了贯彻他们的要求，决定从23日开始每天只作八小时的工。在这以前，汉城以及南朝鲜各地的公共汽车工人一般每天劳动时间长达十八小时。
    新华社平壤23日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜大田、大丘等地的农民和学生继续展开反对傀儡当局和驱逐美李特务的斗争。
    据大田广播电台广播，大田市四十名农民代表在20日和21日到大田“市长”和“副市长”的办公室里静坐示威，反对大田伪市政当局借口“公园用地”强掠农民的耕地然后出卖给投机分子的行为。
    据大丘广播电台广播，大丘广北女子高等学校一千多名学生21日集合在学校里，要求美李特务校长权尚哲和校监崔明柱下台。学生们揭露了权尚哲和崔明柱勾结李承晚的自由党、贪污学生们交纳的学杂费用等卑鄙行为。权尚哲和崔明柱被迫在学生们面前表示同意辞职。
    新华社23日讯　安卡拉消息：土耳其曼德列斯法西斯政府继续加紧疯狂镇压人民反对它的卖国独裁统治的斗争。22日，继宣布实行延长宵禁时间之后，曼德列斯政府又在当晚勒令全国所有大学和专科学校都停课。
    在4月28日土耳其学生举行反对曼德列斯政府的示威之后，曼德列斯政府已经下令首都安卡拉和最大城市伊斯坦布尔的高等学校停课一个月。根据22日的新命令，土耳其全国高等学校都将要关闭到秋季开学时为止。原定6月10日开始的学期考试被延期到10月举行。
    三星期以来土耳其人民掀起的反对美国扶植的曼德列斯卖国政府的大规模示威斗争中，土耳其青年学生一直站在最前列。
    曼德列斯政府在22日宣布的新的镇压措施极其残暴，也反映了它对人民反抗的极其恐慌。这个独裁政府不但延长了宵禁时间，禁止任何示威，威胁要用武力对付任何示威，而且它还禁止举行一切婚丧仪式，规定在电影院、戏院、汽车站或其他公共场所排队时只准排单行，不准居民走近一切军事建筑物。它还公然宣布将偷听首都安卡拉和其他地方之间来往电话，作为严格检查一切通讯的镇压措施一部分。（附图片）
