Urumqi, May 26th (report from this newspaper) – Under the Kunlun Mountains, Hotan Prefecture in Xinjiang has launched a large-scale land reclamation movement. In five months, the entire prefecture has reclaimed over 800,000 mu of irrigated land. Half of the newly reclaimed land has achieved contiguous land and a new irrigated area with a network of canal systems, of which more than 200,000 mu have been sown with spring wheat, highland barley, peas, oil crops and other crops. At present, tens of thousands of laborers in the entire prefecture are rushing to transport seeds and farm implements while also carrying out crash sowing.

Hotan Prefecture has more than 13 million mu of reclaimable wasteland, of which more than 5.5 million mu of wasteland have fertile soil and are suitable for reclamation into farmland, and the remaining wasteland can be reclaimed into pastures and forest farms. In order to reclaim and cultivate these fertile wastelands well, the People's Communes of Hotan Prefecture have established 37 commune-run farms under the unified leadership of the commune, with land owned by the commune and production brigades as the basic accounting unit. The scale of these farms is divided into several thousand mu to thirty or forty thousand mu according to conditions such as land, water conservancy, and labor force. Before reclamation, each commune plans the canal systems, roads, settlements, field ridges, forest belts, horticultural farms, pastures, and feed bases of the wasteland so that reclamation is closely combined with turning land into parkland, water conservancy projects, landscaping, and building new socialist villages in the wasteland. From the beginning, the reclamation of farmland has achieved high standards, establishing irrigation areas with complete canal systems suitable for large-scale mechanized farming.

In order to ensure that all of the more than 800,000 mu of wasteland newly reclaimed this spring are sown, the People's Communes are led by the Party Committee Secretary or the Deputy Director of the Commune to carry out the reclamation work. Nearly 30,000 young adults throughout the district have settled down in the wasteland. In the work of reclamation and sowing, inspection teams led by the Prefectural Party Committee Secretary conduct acceptance inspections according to quality and quantity.

Since liberation, Hotan Prefecture has been expanding its cultivated area every year while increasing the yield per unit area. However, due to limited conditions, reclamation could only be carried out on scattered small areas near the original cultivated land. Only after the establishment of the People's Communes was it possible to organize a large-scale expeditionary force to march towards the desert wasteland. This reclamation increased the average amount of irrigated land by more than one mu per person.

Xinjiang has more than 160 million mu of wasteland that can be reclaimed for farmland. Most of these wastelands are far from oases. Hotan Prefecture's reliance on the strength of the People's Communes to reclaim farmland by expedition has set a good example for farmers of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region to march towards the wasteland.

### 书记挂帅青年上阵　昔日荒沙变成绿洲  和田专区远征开荒八十万亩  半数新垦区已经实现了土地连片渠系成网

    书记挂帅青年上阵　昔日荒沙变成绿洲
    和田专区远征开荒八十万亩
    半数新垦区已经实现了土地连片渠系成网
    本报乌鲁木齐26日电　昆仑山下新疆和田专区开展了大规模的开荒造田运动。五个月中，全专区已开垦出八十多万亩水地，半数新垦荒地已实现了土地连片，渠系成网的园田化新灌区，其中二十多万亩已播种春小麦、青稞、豌豆、油料等作物。目前，全专区有几万劳力，一面赶运种籽农具，一面突击播种。
    和田专区有可垦荒地一千三百多万亩，其中有五百几十万亩荒地土壤肥沃，适宜垦为农田，其余荒地则可垦为牧场和林场。为了把这些肥沃的荒地开好种好，和田专区各人民公社建立了三十七个由公社统一领导、土地社有、以大队为基本核算单位的社办农场。这些农场的规模根据土地、水利、劳动力等条件划为几千亩，三、四万亩不等。各公社在开垦前就把荒地的渠系、道路、居民点、田畦、林带、园艺场、牧场、饲料基地规划出来，使开荒和园田化、水利化、园林化和建设荒地新农村紧密结合，一开始就实现了开荒造田高标准，建起渠系完整、适于大规模机械耕作的灌区。
    为了保证今春新开的八十多万亩荒地全部种上，各人民公社由党委书记或公社副社长领导开荒工作，全区近三万名青壮年，在荒地上定居下来。在开荒和播种工作中，以地委书记为首组成检查团按质按量进行验收。
    和田专区解放后在提高单位面积产量的同时，和田专区年年都扩大耕地面积，但毕竟因为条件限制，开荒只能限于在原来耕地附近零散的小面积上进行。只有在人民公社化后，才有可能组织大规模的远征军向沙漠荒地进军，这次开荒平均每人增加水地一亩一分多。
    新疆拥有可垦为农田的荒地一亿六千多万亩，这些荒地大都远离绿洲，和田地区依靠人民公社力量远征开荒造田，为自治区各民族农民群众向荒地进军树立了好榜样。（附图片）
