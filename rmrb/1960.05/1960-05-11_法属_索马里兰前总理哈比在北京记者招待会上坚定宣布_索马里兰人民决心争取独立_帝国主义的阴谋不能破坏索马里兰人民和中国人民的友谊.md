Xinhua News Agency, May 10th: Mohammed Habbi, the former Prime Minister of "French" Somaliland and Chairman of the Somaliland Democratic Union, who is currently visiting China, solemnly announced today: "The people of Somaliland are determined to win freedom, independence, and unity at any cost." He called on all Asian and African countries and freedom-loving nations to "support and assist the legitimate aspirations of the people of Somaliland to achieve national independence and unity." He said, "Despite the various conspiracies of colonialism and imperialism, the people of Somaliland will always be true and steadfast friends of the Chinese people." Mohammed Habbi made these remarks at a press conference held in Beijing this afternoon for Chinese and foreign journalists. Mohammed Habbi strongly condemned the atrocities and barbarism of the French imperialists in "French" Somaliland.

Speaking of his impressions of this visit to China, he said that before coming to China, he had seen books about China written by colonialists, saying that China had a large number of starving people. He said that he had personally visited China this time, visited many places, and saw that there was no unemployment, no homelessness, and no beggars in China, while many other capitals he had visited had beggars. He said: "Therefore, I am convinced that what the colonialist newspapers and books say are all lies. Their attempt is to divide us."

Mohammed Habbi said that he had a very good conversation with Chairman Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders in a friendly and brotherly atmosphere. He said: "Chairman Mao Zedong said that world peace should be maintained, and we agree with his view. I would like to convey to Chairman Mao Zedong the respect and sincere friendship of the people of Somaliland."

Ali Abdillahi, Secretary-General of the Somaliland Democratic Union who accompanied Habbi, also attended the press conference.

    “法属”索马里兰前总理哈比在北京记者招待会上坚定宣布
     索马里兰人民决心争取独立
    帝国主义的阴谋不能破坏索马里兰人民和中国人民的友谊
    据新华社10日讯　正在我国访问的“法属”索马里兰前总理、索马里兰民主联盟主席穆罕默德·哈比今天郑重宣布：“索马里兰人民决心不惜任何代价来赢取自由、独立和统一。”他呼吁所有亚非国家和爱好自由的民族“支持和援助索马里兰人民争取祖国独立和统一的正当愿望。”他说：“尽管殖民主义和帝国主义玩弄种种阴谋，索马里兰人民将永远是中国人民真正的、坚定的朋友。”穆罕默德·哈比是今天下午在北京举行的中外记者招待会上说这番话的。穆罕默德·哈比严厉谴责了法帝国主义者在“法属”索马里兰的暴行和野蛮行为。
    谈到他这次访问中国的观感时，他说，来到中国之前他看到殖民主义者所写的关于中国的书籍，说什么中国有大量受饥挨饿的人。他说，他这次亲自来到中国访问了很多地方，看了很多工厂，看到了在中国没有失业、没有无家可归的人，没有乞丐，而他访问过的许多其他国家的首都都有乞丐。他说：“因此，我深信，殖民主义者的报刊和书籍所说的都是假的。他们的企图是分裂我们。”
    穆罕默德·哈比说，他在友好的兄弟般的气氛中同毛泽东主席和中国的其他领导人进行了交谈，谈得很好。他说：“毛泽东主席说，应该维护世界和平，我们同意他的看法。我谨向毛泽东主席转致索马里兰人民的敬意和真诚的友谊。”
    同哈比来访的法属索马里兰民主联盟总书记阿里·阿卜迪拉西也出席了记者招待会。
