Guangzhou Dispatch: Guangdong's seven major sugar factories and communes in sugarcane-producing areas are linking up to carry out a large-scale mass movement to support agriculture, which has powerfully promoted the production of sugarcane, the raw material for sugar production.

Starting in the second half of last year, the Jiangmen Sugarcane Chemical Factory and the Zhongshan, Shunde, Zini, Dongguan, Nanhai and other sugar factories in the Pearl River Delta region successively adopted the method of directly linking up with sugarcane-producing communes to help one or several communes. For example, the Jiangmen Sugarcane Chemical Factory determined to focus on linking up with the communes in Xinhui, Taishan, Kaiping, and other places in the main sugarcane supply area. Due to the establishment of fixed cooperative relationships, the comprehensive support for agriculture can be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. For example, under the slogan of "Stepping out of the factory and going deep into the communes," Zini and other sugar factories have factory leaders and engineering technicians go to the linked communes to understand the needs of the countryside. Nanhai Sugar Factory and others invited the Party secretaries of the linked communes to the factory for discussions to jointly study support methods. After understanding the needs of the communes, each factory formulated plans, distinguished priorities, and organized a large-scale mass movement to support agriculture. The practices of the factories mainly have five aspects: 1. Using the methods of "inviting in and sending out" to train technical forces for the communes; 2. Helping the communes to run industries in terms of technology and equipment; 3. Assisting the communes in improving agricultural tools; 4. Organizing sugarcane field technical management teams; 5. Supplying the chemical fertilizers and sugarcane seedlings needed for sugarcane fields.

    广东七大糖厂同蔗区公社挂钩
    支援农业生产　扩大原料来源
    本报广州18日电　广东省七大糖厂和产蔗区公社挂钩，开展大规模支援农业的群众运动，有力地促进了制糖原料甘蔗的生产。
    珠江三角洲地区的江门甘蔗化工厂和中山、顺德、紫坭、东莞、南海等糖厂，从去年下半年开始，先后采取了同产蔗公社直接挂钩的办法，帮助一个或几个公社。如江门甘蔗化工厂，就确定以主要供蔗区的新会、台山、开平等地的公社为挂钩重点。由于固定了协作关系，使全面支援农业的工作能够有计划有步骤地进行。如紫坭等糖厂在“走出工厂、深入公社”的口号下，由厂领导干部带领工程技术人员到挂钩公社了解农村需要；南海糖厂等邀请挂钩公社的党委书记到工厂进行座谈，共同研究支援办法。在摸清公社需要后，各厂都制订了规划，分清轻重缓急，组织大规模支援农业的群众运动。各厂的做法主要有五个方面。一、用“请进来，派出去”的方法为公社培训技术力量；二、从技术、设备方面帮助公社办工业；三、协助公社改良农具；四、组织甘蔗田间技术管理队；五、供应蔗田所需的化肥和糖种甘蔗的种苗。
