Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, May 2nd: Premier Zhou Enlai met with the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party organizations, governments, military, democratic parties, and people's organizations of Guizhou Province and Guiyang City, as well as model workers on various production fronts in Guiyang City, and representatives of ethnic minorities this afternoon in Guiyang City, and had cordial talks with them. During the talks, Premier Zhou inquired about the current work and construction situation in Guizhou Province. Premier Zhou said: The old saying "No three days of sunshine, no three miles of flat land, no three fen of silver for the people" should be fundamentally negated. He said that Guizhou has beautiful mountains and rivers, a pleasant climate, abundant resources, and hardworking people. As long as the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, strengthen unity and work hard, the socialist construction of Guizhou will surely catch up and surpass others, and there is great hope.

Comrade Deng Yingchao and the comrades who accompanied Premier Zhou on his visit abroad also participated in the meeting.

After the meeting, Premier Zhou had dinner with everyone. Soviet expert Gari Ming Sergey Semyonovich, who was in Guiyang, also dined with Premier Zhou.
