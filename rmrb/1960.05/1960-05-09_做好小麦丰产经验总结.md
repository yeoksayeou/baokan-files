    Summarize Wheat High-Yield Experiences

    The situation of a bumper harvest of winter wheat across the country in 1960 has already taken shape. Seriously summarizing the experience of this year's winter wheat high-yield is an important task for wheat-producing areas during the summer harvest.

    This year, high-yield demonstration plots and small-area, high-yield experimental fields have increased significantly compared to previous years. High-yield plots and experimental fields are concentrated areas for implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" and the wisdom of the masses. Therefore, summarizing this year's wheat high-yield experience should focus on them. The transformation of low-yield fields into high-yield fields is a noteworthy aspect of wheat production. Summarizing experience in this area is of great significance for balanced production increase and striving for a universal bumper harvest of wheat. Achieving agricultural modernization is the direction of agricultural development in our country. In summarizing this year's wheat high-yield experience, we should also pay attention to some new issues of how wheat production can adapt to gardening, mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification.

    Summarizing wheat high-yield experience, like summarizing other experiences, must be well-organized and have clear viewpoints. Summarizing wheat high-yield experience must first have the basic conditions and management process of typical high-yield fields or plots; second, analyze the main experiences of achieving high-yield around the "Eight-Point Charter," citing necessary survey data to connect and comprehensively discuss; finally, analyze and discuss the applicable scope and application value of these experiences, propose future production increase measures and opinions, as well as issues that need to be further improved and resolved.

    The influence of climatic conditions on wheat growth and yield, experience in preventing frost or rescuing after frost damage, experience in large-scale prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, various tool reforms adapted to wheat, and experience in achieving high-yield and bumper harvest, with grains returned to the home, should all be investigated and summarized with emphasis and purpose according to local conditions.

    For most areas, there are still one or two months before the wheat harvest. However, in terms of summarizing this production experience, time is very pressing. We suggest that the leading departments in wheat-producing areas quickly grasp this task and take immediate action.

### 做好小麦丰产经验总结

    做好小麦丰产经验总结
    1960年全国冬小麦大丰收的形势已经形成，认真做好今年冬小麦丰产经验总结，是夏收期间麦产区的一件重要的工作。
    今年小麦大面积丰产方和小面积高额丰产试验田都比往年增加很多，丰产方和试验田又是贯彻执行
  “八字宪法”和群众智慧的集中表现的园地。因此总结今年小麦丰产经验应当以它们为主要对象。低产田变高产田是小麦生产中的一个值得注意的方面，总结这方面的经验对平衡增产，争取小麦普遍丰收也是有巨大意义的。实现农业现代化是我国农业发展的方向，在总结今年小麦丰产经验工作中还应当重视小麦生产如何适应园田化、机械化、水利化、电气化的一些新问题。
    总结小麦丰产经验和总结别的经验一样，必须条理分明，观点明确。总结小麦丰产经验首先要有典型丰产田或丰产方的基本情况和管理过程；其次要围绕“八字宪法”分析获得丰产的主要经验，引证必要的调查资料加以相互联系，综合论述；最后分析讨论这些经验的适用范围和应用价值，提出今后的增产措施和意见，以及需要进一步提高和解决的问题等。
    气候条件对小麦生育和产量的影响，预防霜冻或冻后挽救经验，大面积防治病虫的经验，各种适应于小麦的工具改革，以及丰产丰收、颗粒还家的收获脱粒经验等，都应该根据当地具体情况有重点、有目的地进行调查总结。
    就大部地区说，目前距收麦还有一、两月的时间，但是从总结这项生产经验的工作说，时间是很紧迫的，我们建议各麦产区的领导部门赶快抓住这项工作，迅速行动起来。
