Xinhua News Agency, 30th - According to TASS Moscow: The All-Soviet Conference of Advanced Workers in the Competition for the Title of Communist Labor Teams and Shock Workers concluded on the 30th at the Kremlin in Moscow.

The conference adopted a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The letter stated that the Soviet people, closely united around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are full of determination to continue to give the aggressors a devastating blow in the future, to stop the aggressors' actions that endanger the cause of world peace, and to unswervingly fight for world peace.

The participants in the conference expressed in the letter their unanimous support for the activities of the CPSU Central Committee in strengthening friendly relations between the people of all countries and the work done in improving the lives of the Soviet people.

The conference also adopted a letter to the working people of the Soviet Union, calling on the working people in Soviet cities and countryside to actively participate in the communist labor collectives and shock worker movements, to use their creative labor and constantly improve their awareness to more actively fight for the completion of the tasks of communist construction.

Soviet Communist Party and government leaders Aristov, Brezhnev, Ignatov, Kozlov, Kuusinen, Mukhitdinov, Polyansky, Khrushchev, Shvernik, and Pospelov attended today's meeting.

At today's meeting, Soviet Defense Minister Malinovsky and Soviet Academy of Sciences President Nesmeyanov gave congratulatory speeches to the conference on behalf of the Soviet military personnel and scientific workers, respectively.

Subsequently, All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions Chairman Grishin made a concluding speech.

The conference finally unanimously adopted the conference resolution, the letter to the working people of the Soviet Union, and the letter to the CPSU Central Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 30th - At the May 30th meeting of the All-Soviet Conference of Advanced Workers in the Competition for the Title of Communist Labor Teams and Shock Workers, representatives continued to angrily condemn the U.S. imperialists' provocative actions of aggression against the Soviet Union and their crimes of sabotaging the four-nation government summit. The representatives unanimously stated that they would continue to use greater labor achievements to enhance the power of the motherland and give the aggressors a fatal blow at any time.

The famous train driver Brazhenov pointed out in his speech that the U.S. imperialists shamelessly sabotaged the four-nation government summit. The Soviet Union exposed the U.S. imperialists' sinister plan, and its "peace" mask has been torn off. No matter what tricks the U.S. imperialists play, they cannot escape the guilt of sabotaging the summit. The people of the world have seen that the truth is on the side of the Soviet Union. He also said that the imperialists should know that we have sufficient strength to defend the honor of the motherland and to defend our peaceful labor. We will give a resolute response to the invading aggressors. In his speech, he also angrily condemned the United Nations Security Council for exonerating the United States under the control of the United States.

Mochta, a steelworker and Hero of Socialist Labor from Dnepropetrovsk, said that the U.S. imperialists cannot shirk the guilt of sabotaging the four-nation government summit. The U.S. imperialists only talk about peace in words, but in reality, they send spy planes to other countries, actively revive West German fascist forces, prepare for war, and try their best to obstruct the smooth progress of the Geneva conference on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. He said that our steelworkers will produce more steel to consolidate the Soviet Union's national defense.

Mazayeva, a student at the Moscow Power Institute, said that Soviet youth are extremely indignant at the provocative actions of the United States.

Soviet Academy of Sciences President Nesmeyanov pointed out in his speech at the meeting that the responsibility for sabotaging the four-nation government summit should be entirely borne by the United States. It is now very clear that the U.S. ruling clique is unwilling to seriously resolve international disputes, and some recent remarks by U.S. ruling clique leaders have aroused the irrepressible anger of the entire Soviet people. Nesmeyanov said that Soviet scientists are working hard to solve a series of important scientific problems. They will spare no effort to consolidate their motherland.

Baku oil worker Dzafarov pointed out that Baku's oil workers and all the people of the Azerbaijan Republic unanimously support Khrushchev's statement in Paris exposing U.S. imperialism. He said that we feel incomparably angry at the hypocritical faces of Eisenhower, Nixon, and Herter. The Soviet people warn the aggressors: No one is allowed to invade Soviet territory.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 30th - According to "Pravda" reports, during the All-Soviet Conference of Advanced Workers in the Competition for the Title of Communist Labor Teams and Shock Workers, the representatives attending the conference and the people of the Soviet Union unanimously and angrily condemned the U.S. imperialists' provocation against the Soviet Union and their aggressive policies. Conference representative Alekseevich, a worker at the Minsk Ball Bearing Factory, said in a statement published in "Pravda" that the U.S. imperialists' shameless provocation against the Soviet Union filled my heart with anger. All the members of our delegation and the workers of the entire Belorussia firmly support the measures taken by the Soviet government to strengthen its national defense forces.

Coal miner and Hero of Socialist Labor Kublashvili said that we members of the Georgian delegation were very excited after listening to the report at the meeting. We unanimously denounced the war instigators as shameful.

Shepherd Murmhanov said: My heart is full of resentment. On behalf of our work team and my family, I express my anger at the shameful actions of the American aggressors. We will shoot down every enemy plane that breaks into our airspace.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 29th - After listening to the speech by Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev at the All-Soviet Conference of Advanced Workers in the Competition for the Title of Communist Labor Teams and Shock Workers on the 28th, the working people of the Soviet Union held meetings one after another. They expressed their warm approval of the government's peace-loving foreign policy and were determined to tirelessly consolidate the motherland's power. They also condemned the dirty and shameful provocative acts of the American aggressors with anger.

Workshops at the Likhachev Automobile Factory, Small Car Factory, First Ball Bearing Factory, and "Three Mountains" Textile Factory in Moscow held meetings. Movchanr, captain of the spinning team at the "Three Mountains" Textile Factory, said at the meeting: We believe that communist labor must be victorious, and we assure the Party and the government that we will further improve our labor enthusiasm and labor productivity in the future. Our construction plan is very large, so we need peace. The shameless actions of the American provocateurs have aroused great anger among our textile workers. The provocateurs should remember: we will continue to regard any attempt to violate Soviet airspace as an act of aggression in the future, and we will always strike back at the aggressors. Textile worker Kuznetsova said: We advocate peace and the maintenance of the sovereignty of all countries. Therefore, we condemn the conspiracy of the American war provocateurs with particular indignation.

Krestyaninnikov, a lathe worker and member of the Communist Labor Team at the Leningrad Metal Factory's mechanical assembly workshop, said that each of us not only warmly supports the government's domestic and foreign policies, but also actively works to implement these policies and uses our labor to consolidate peace. However, we are always ready to give the shameless imperialists a devastating blow.

Berezin, a rolling mill worker at the Red Sormovo Shipyard in Gorky, said that our steps towards communism are firm, and neither U.S. imperialism nor other "Cold War" defenders can stop us from moving forward.

The soldiers of the Black Sea Fleet unanimously expressed their determination to tirelessly expose the imperialists' aggressive conspiracies and to heighten their vigilance. Navy Major Sizonyenko said that Khrushchev's angry rebuttal of U.S. imperialism is the voice of all the Soviet people. Now, the U.S. imperialists are trying to shift the blame for sabotaging the summit to others, and this will never succeed. Khrushchev's speech exposed them sharply.

Krishtiannikov, a worker at the Leningrad Hardware Factory, said at the meeting that we must use labor to strengthen the cause of peace. The Soviet people will always agree to develop friendly relations with the people of all countries, but at any time we should be prepared to give the imperialists a fatal blow. Turkmen Republic Ashgabat Textile Factory worker Nepesov said at the meeting that all honest people are angry at U.S. imperialism's provocation against the Soviet Union. Minsk Automatic Production Line Factory worker Belogurtsev said that all honest people in the world are against the aggressors, and the imperialist gentlemen will soon feel this.

    第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克的炼钢工人、社会主义劳动英雄莫赫塔说，美帝国主义是推脱不掉破坏四国政府首脑会议的罪责的。美帝国主义只是在口头上谈和平，而实际上却向别国派遣间谍飞机，积极复活西德法西斯势力，准备战争，并且极力阻挠日内瓦不继续核武器试验会议的顺利进行。他说，我们钢铁工人将生产更多的钢铁，来巩固苏联的国防。

    莫斯科李哈乔夫汽车厂、小型汽车厂、第一滚珠轴承厂以及“三山”纺织厂的各个车间都举行了集会。“三山”纺织厂纺织工作队长莫夫昌尔在会上说：我们相信共产主义劳动一定要获得胜利，我们向党和政府保证，今后要更加提高劳动积极性和劳动生产率。我们的建设计划很大，因此，我们需要和平。美国挑衅者的无耻行动在我们纺织工人中引起了极大的愤怒。挑衅者们应该记住：我们今后还要把侵犯苏联领空的一切尝试看成是侵略行为，而对侵略者我们永远是要打击的。纺织工库兹涅佐娃说：我们主张和平，主张维护各国的主权，因此，我们以特别愤慨的心情谴责美国战争挑衅者的阴谋。
    列宁格勒金属工厂机械装配车间共产主义劳动队队员、旋工克列斯季扬尼科夫说，我们每个人不仅热烈支持政府的内外政策，并且积极为实现这些政策而工作，用自己劳动来巩固和平。然而，我们在任何时候都准备着给厚颜无耻的帝国主义者以毁灭性的打击。
    高尔基的红色索尔莫沃造船厂辗压工人别列津说，我们走向共产主义的步伐是坚定的，无论是美帝国主义或是其他“冷战”捍卫者，都不能阻止我们前进。
    黑海舰队的战士们一致表示要不倦地揭露帝国主义的侵略阴谋，提高警惕性。海军少校西佐宁科说，赫鲁晓夫对美帝国主义愤怒的驳斥是全体苏联人民的声音。现在，美帝国主义者正企图把破坏首脑会议的罪责转嫁于人，这是决不会成功的。赫鲁晓夫的讲话一针见血地揭穿了他们。
    列宁格勒五金工厂工人克里斯强尼科夫在集会上说，我们要用劳动来加强和平事业。苏联人民永远赞同同各国人民发展友好关系，但是，任何时候都应该准备着给帝国主义者以致命的打击。土库曼共和国阿什哈巴德纺织工厂工人涅佩索夫在集会上说，所有正直的人都对美帝国主义对苏联的挑衅感到愤怒。明斯克自动工作线工厂工人别洛古尔采夫说，全世界所有正直的人都反对侵略者，帝国主义老爷们很快就会感到这一点。
