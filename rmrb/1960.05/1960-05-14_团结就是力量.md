Unity is Strength
By Our Staff Commentator

At a critical moment when the Kishi Nobusuke government is stepping up its efforts to force the Diet to approve the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and the Japanese people are launching an unprecedentedly powerful 16th unified action, the Kishi Nobusuke government is again carrying out new armed suppression of the Miike coal mine workers who are fighting to defend their vital interests. This incident is not accidental. It is a planned provocation by the Japanese reactionary forces against the Japanese working class.

The Miike Coal Mine Workers' Union is one of the most powerful unions in Japan. The Miike coal mine workers, who have persisted in an eight-month struggle against the Mitsui zaibatsu's dismissal plan, have always stood at the forefront of the struggle against the Diet's approval of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The Kishi Nobusuke government, a faithful servant of Japanese monopoly capital, has spared no effort to suppress and undermine the workers' movement in order to strike at the working class, the backbone of the anti-American patriotic struggle, and has first directed its spearhead at the Miike coal mine workers. For eight months, the Kishi Nobusuke government has dispatched thousands of police officers to Miike, not only colluding with the Mitsui zaibatsu to murder Kubo Kiyoshi, a Miike coal mine worker, but also injuring more than 200 workers and arresting more than 30 workers without cause.

The Kishi Nobusuke government's open use of police to suppress the struggle of the Miike coal mine workers shows that, with the signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, Japan is increasingly becoming a police state like it was before the war. The Japanese people have become increasingly clear that the revival of fascist militarism not only threatens peace in Asia, but also threatens the vital interests of the Japanese people first and foremost. In this sense, the struggle of the Miike workers is also an integral part of the struggle against Japanese militarism. We salute the heroic struggle of the Miike coal mine workers and protest the atrocities of the Kishi Nobusuke government. We believe that as long as the Japanese working class is united, they will be able to achieve victory in the struggle to defend their vital interests and in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

    正当岸信介政府加紧策划强使国会批准日美军事同盟条约和日本人民展开空前强大的第十六次统一行动的紧要时刻，岸信介政府又对为保卫自己的切身利益而斗争的三池煤矿工人进行新的武装镇压。这一事件并不是偶然的。它是日本反动势力对日本工人阶级的有计划的挑衅。
    三池煤矿工会是日本有数的实力强大的工会。为反对三井财阀解雇计划而坚持了八个月斗争的三池煤矿工人，从来就站在反对国会批准日美军事同盟条约斗争的前列。日本垄断资本的忠实奴仆岸信介政府，为了打击反美爱国斗争中的中坚力量——工人阶级，不遗余力地镇压和破坏工人运动，并且把矛头首先指向三池煤矿工人。八个月来，岸信介政府调集数千警察陈兵三池，不仅同三井财阀合谋杀害三池煤矿工人久保清，而且先后打伤了二百多名工人，无端逮捕了三十多名工人。
    岸信介政府公然使用警察镇压三池煤矿工人斗争，表明随着日美军事同盟条约的签订，日本正日益成为一个像战前一样的警察国家。日本人民已愈来愈清楚地看到：法西斯军国主义的复活，不仅威胁到亚洲和平，而且首先威胁到日本人民的切身利益。从这个意义上来说，三池工人的斗争，也正是反对日本军国主义斗争的一个组成部分。我们向英勇斗争的三池煤矿工人致意，并抗议岸信介政府的暴行。我们相信，只要日本工人阶级团结一致，他们就有可能在保卫自己的切身利益的斗争中取得胜利，在反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争中取得胜利。
