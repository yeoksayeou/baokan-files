    The Origin of the Toothbrush
    Many archaeologists and anthropologists have proven that there are traces of toothpick use on the jaws of ancient humans. At that time, the raw materials for toothpicks were made of wood, stone, ivory, etc. The shapes included needle tips, hooks, and knife and fork shapes. It is speculated that the purpose of humans using toothpicks at that time was to remove food stuck between the teeth.
    Later, it slowly evolved to using twigs and bamboo strips as toothpicks. At the same time, one end was flattened and split, so that the fibers separated to form a brush shape, which was used as a toothbrush.
    According to the currently known information, modern forms of bristle toothbrushes already existed in China a thousand years ago.
    In the burial objects of the tomb of the Liao Prince Consort Wei Wang of Dayingzi Village, Chifeng, excavated in 1954, there were two bone toothbrush handles. The shape of the brush handle is similar to that of modern toothbrush handles, and the length is also very similar. Because of the age, the bristle bundles are gone, but the toothbrush handle is still intact, and it can be seen that it is made of bone. The toothbrush head has eight bristle holes, evenly divided into two rows. Next to the holes, rust marks can still be seen, possibly from metal wire tying. This tomb dates back to the ninth year of Yingli in the Liao Dynasty, which is 959 AD. Formal toothbrushes did not appear in Europe until 1640.

    牙刷的来源
    许多考古学家及人类学家都证明在远古人类的颔骨上，有使用牙签的痕迹。当时牙签的原料是由木头、石头、象牙等制成的。形状有针尖形、钩形、刀叉形等。据推测，当时人类使用牙签的目的，还是为了剔除嵌塞在牙缝间的食物。
    后来慢慢演变，改用为树枝、竹片做成牙签。同时把它的一端咬平、咬裂，使其纤维分开成为刷形，就作为牙刷使用。
    现代形式的植毛牙刷，据现在所知道的资料，在一千年前，我国就已经有了。
    在1954年所发掘的赤峰大营子村辽驸马卫国王墓中的随葬品中，有两把骨制牙刷柄。刷柄的形状和现代的牙刷柄差不多，长度也很相似。因为年代已久，毛束已经没有了，而牙刷柄仍然完整，并能看出是骨制品。牙刷头部有八个植毛孔，均匀地分成两排。在孔旁还能看出可能是用金属丝结扎过的锈痕。这个墓是在辽代应历九年，即公元959年。而在欧洲到1640年才出现有正式牙刷。
