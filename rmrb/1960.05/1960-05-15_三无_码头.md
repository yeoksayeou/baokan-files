    "Three-No" Wharf

    The vast number of workers at the Xuzhou Coal Port construction site on the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal are vigorously promoting the use of substitute building materials, creating a "three-no" wharf with no cement, no steel bars, and no wood.

    This is a 150-meter-long repair wharf that can accommodate three ships simultaneously. If a similar type of concrete structure were used, it would require 660 tons of cement; if a reinforced concrete structure were used, it would require 60 tons of steel bars and 220 tons of cement; if a wooden cage structure were used, it would require 1,125 cubic meters of wood. The "three-no" wharf uses entirely steam-cured silicate concrete, wet-ground slag concrete, lime-burnt bonded concrete, and wood-chip concrete, all made from slag and silt as raw materials. The use of these substitute building materials in wharf projects and underwater structures must meet high-standard design requirements for frost resistance, corrosion resistance, impermeability, and wear resistance. To quickly overcome technical hurdles, Tsinghua University, the Cement Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, and the Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute sent technicians to assist with experiments, ensuring that the various properties of the substitute materials met the design requirements, and shortening the wharf's construction period by four-fifths.

    “三无”码头
    京杭大运河徐州煤港工地的广大职工，大搞建筑材料代用，创造了无水泥、无钢筋、无木料的“三无”码头。
    这是一座长一百五十米、同时可停靠三艘轮船的修船码头。如果采用同类型的混凝土结构，需用水泥六百六十吨；如果采用钢筋混凝土结构，需用钢筋六十吨和水泥二百二十吨；如果采用木笼结构，需用木材一千一百二十五立方米。这个“三无”码头的全部材料采用以矿渣、粉砂做原料的蒸养矽酸混凝土、湿碾矿渣混凝土、石灰烧粘混凝土、木屑混凝土等。在码头工程和水下建筑物中，使用这些建筑材料代用品，它必须适应抗冻、抗蚀、抗渗、耐磨等高标准的设计要求。为了迅速攻破技术关，清华大学、建筑工程部水泥科学研究所、南京水利科学研究所都派出技术员协助试验，使代用材料的各种性能都达到了设计要求，码头工期还缩短了五分之四。
