Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang. Jiangxi Province's transportation front is vigorously carrying out one-stop transportation of ore and coal, ensuring the needs of steel production for raw materials and fuel, and paving the way for the high-speed leap forward in steel production throughout the province.

Since the second quarter, Jiangxi Province has launched a new upsurge in vigorously developing steel and striving for high-speed steel production. Steel plants in various places have an urgent need for raw materials and fuels such as ore and coal. In order to ensure the timely transportation of steel raw materials and fuels, employees at ports, stations, and factories and mines first launched a technical revolution movement for mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, which rapidly doubled the efficiency of loading and unloading. On the transportation route from Tonglingshan Iron Mine in Ruichang County to Nanchang Iron and Steel Plant, the phenomenon of not guaranteeing daily transport and monthly transport often occurred in the past due to the low loading and unloading efficiency of stations and ports; after the relevant station and port employees vigorously carried out mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, various indigenous and foreign combined machines replaced manual loading and unloading, reducing automobile loading from half an hour at a time to no more than one minute per ton and unloading to no more than two minutes per ton, and ship loading and unloading from two days to twelve hours, greatly accelerating vehicle turnaround. The average daily transport volume of ore increased from 478 tons in the past to more than 1,200 tons per day, and the transportation plan was overfulfilled every day.

In order to meet the needs of one-stop coal and ore transportation, the transportation tools and dedicated lines between factories and mines have been rapidly strengthened and improved. According to the transport volume of raw materials and fuels of the province's major steel enterprises, railway, highway, shipping and other water and land transportation departments throughout the province have transferred 30% of modern transportation tools to be specifically responsible for the long-distance transportation of raw material and fuel production bases, ensuring that as much as is produced is transported, and where it is needed, it is transported. At the same time, transportation department employees also worked with factory and mine employees to vigorously develop the reconstruction and construction of dedicated lines, so that short-distance transportation and long-distance transportation were closely connected and mutually adapted.

In order to strengthen transportation collaboration, transportation departments throughout the province have generally established joint collaboration offices for production, transportation, and sales, as well as undertaking, consignment, and handling at the water and land transportation hubs on the factory and mine transportation lines to specifically organize matters such as undertaking consignment, water-land intermodal transportation, loading and unloading handling, and long and short-distance transfers, so that they can be consistent in pace and closely connected in all aspects. Relevant units such as water and land transportation departments, steel plants, coal mines, and iron mines throughout the province have also generally signed one-stop transportation agreements, strictly following the stipulated time and place for delivery, transportation, and unloading. At present, more than 100 one-stop coal and ore transportation lines have been organized between various steel bases and coal mines and iron mines throughout the province through the signing of agreements, so that many links such as highways, railways, shipping, handling, loading and unloading, coal mines, iron mines, and steel plants are twisted into one rope.

The continuous improvement of raw material and fuel transportation efficiency has guaranteed the high-speed leap forward in steel production. In the past, the New Yu Iron and Steel Plant's blast furnace was often affected by output due to ore and coal transportation not keeping up; after the implementation of one-stop factory and mine transportation, it not only guaranteed the needs of the blast furnace but also had ore reserves, and the output of pig iron also increased significantly.

    水陆联运、装卸搬运、长短途转运环环扣紧赶运铁厂“粮草”
    江西组织矿石煤炭运输一条龙
    据新华社南昌电　江西省交通战线大搞矿石、煤炭运输一条龙，确保钢铁生产对原料材料和燃料的需要，为全省钢铁生产高速度跃进开路。
    第二季度以来，江西省掀起了大搞钢铁、力争钢铁生产高速度的新高潮。各地钢铁厂对矿石、煤炭等原料燃料的需要既多又急。为了保证钢铁原料燃料的及时运输，各地港口、车站及厂矿职工，首先展开了装卸搬运机械化半机械化的技术革命运动，使装卸搬运效率迅速得到成倍的提高。瑞昌县铜岭山铁矿到南昌钢铁厂的运输途中，过去因车站、港口装卸搬运功效低，经常出现日运不保旬，旬运不保月的现象；各有关车站、港口职工，大搞装卸搬运机械化半机械化以后，各种土洋结合的机械代替了人力装卸搬运，使汽车装卸由过去半小时一次压缩为装车一吨不过一分钟，卸车一吨不过二分钟，船舶装卸由过去两天压缩为十二小时，大大加速了车辆周转，矿石的平均日运量由过去四百七十八吨提高到日运一千二百多吨，运输计划天天超额完成。
    为了适应煤炭、矿石运输一条龙的需要，厂矿之间的交通运输工具和专用线路，都迅速得到了加强和改善。全省铁路、公路、航运等水陆交通部门，根据全省主要钢铁企业原料燃料的运量情况，抽调了30％的现代化交通运输工具，专门担负原料燃料生产基地的长途运输，做到了生产多少运多少，那里需要就运到那里。与此同时，交通部门职工还同厂矿职工一道，大力展开了专用线的改建、兴建工作，使短途运输与长途运输紧密衔接，互相适应。
    为了加强运输协作，全省各地交通运输部门在厂矿运输线上的水陆交通枢纽地点普遍建立了产、运、销和承、托、搬协作联合办公室，具体组织承运托运、水陆联运、装卸搬运、长短途转运等事宜，使之步调一致、各方紧密衔接。各水陆交通部门、钢铁厂、煤矿、铁矿等有关单位，也普遍签订了一条龙运输协议书，严格按照规定的时间、地点发货、运货、卸货。目前，全省各个钢铁基地与煤矿、铁矿之间，通过签订协议，已经组织了一百多条煤炭、矿石运输一条龙，使公路、铁路、航运、搬运、装卸、煤矿、铁矿、钢铁厂等许多环节拧成了一股绳。
    原料燃料运输效率的不断提高，保证了钢铁生产的高速度跃进。新喻钢铁厂高炉过去常因矿石、煤炭运输赶不上，而影响产量；实现厂矿运输一条龙后，不仅保证了高炉需要，并且有了矿石储备，生铁产量也有了显著提高。
