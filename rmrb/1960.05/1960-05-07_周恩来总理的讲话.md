Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 5th. Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech at a banquet held by the Cambodian Regency Council today. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Your Royal Highness Prince Monireth, Chairman of the Regency Council, esteemed friends:

First of all, I would like to thank our hosts, the Regency Council headed by Prince Monireth, for holding such a grand and cordial banquet for us. I would like to take this opportunity to once again pay tribute to the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Cambodian people on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people.

I clearly remember that when I first visited your beautiful country three and a half years ago, His Majesty King Suramarit personally received us and repeatedly expressed his desire to visit China. This desire embodied the friendly feelings of the Cambodian people towards the Chinese people. Unfortunately, His Majesty the King passed away before his wish could be fulfilled. The Chinese people will never forget the efforts made by His Majesty the King during his lifetime to promote Sino-Cambodian friendship. On behalf of the Chinese Government and the people, and in my own name and that of Vice Premier Chen Yi, I would like to express my deep condolences on the passing of King Suramarit, and my sincere condolences to Her Majesty the Queen, Prince Sihanouk, and all members of the royal family.

China and Cambodia are both countries with a long history and culture. We both face the arduous tasks of safeguarding our national independence, building our countries, and striving for world peace. The friendly cooperation between our two countries is in the fundamental interests of our two peoples. I am pleased to point out that in recent years, the friendly relations between our two countries have greatly developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Among these, I would like to particularly mention the outstanding contributions made by Prince Sihanouk. At the same time, Her Majesty the Queen has also shown meticulous care for promoting Sino-Cambodian friendship. I believe that with our joint efforts, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries will be further consolidated and developed.

Allow me to propose a toast:

To Cambodia's prosperity and strength,

To the close friendship between the peoples of China and Cambodia,

to the health of Her Majesty the Queen,

To the health of all members of the Regency Council headed by Prince Monireth,

To the health of Prince Sihanouk,

Cheers!

    周恩来总理的讲话
    新华社金边5日电　周恩来总理今天在柬埔寨摄政委员会举行的宴会上发表了讲话，讲话全文如下：尊敬的摄政委员会主席莫尼勒亲王殿下，尊敬的朋友们：
    首先，我要感谢我们的主人们，以莫尼勒亲王为首的摄政委员会为我们举行这样一个隆重而又亲切的宴会。我想利用这个机会，代表中国政府和中国人民再一次向柬埔寨王国政府和柬埔寨人民致敬。
    我还清楚地记得，在三年半以前我第一次访问你们美丽的国家的时候，苏拉玛里特国王陛下，亲自接待我们，并且一再向我们表示他要访问中国的愿望，这种愿望体现了柬埔寨人民对于中国人民的友好感情。不幸国王陛下在他的这个愿望没有实现以前就与世长辞了，国王陛下生前促进中柬友好的努力是中国人民不能忘记的。我谨代表中国政府和人民，并且以陈毅副总理和我个人的名义，对于苏拉玛里特国王的逝世表示深切的悼念，同时对于王后陛下和西哈努克亲王殿下以及全体王室成员表示真挚的慰问。
    中柬两国都是有着悠久历史和文化的国家。我们都面临着维护自己的民族独立，建设自己的国家和争取世界和平的艰巨任务。我们两国的友好合作是符合我们两国人民的根本利益的。我高兴地指出，这几年来我们两国的友好关系在和平共处五项原则的基础上有了很大的发展。在这当中我愿意特别指出西哈努克亲王所作的卓越贡献。同时，王后陛下对于促进中柬友谊也表示了无微不至的关怀。我相信，在我们的共同努力之下，我们两国的友好合作关系必将进一步得到巩固和发展。
    请允许我建议：
    为柬埔寨王国的繁荣昌盛，
    为中柬两国人民的亲密友谊，
    为王后陛下的健康，
    为以莫尼勒亲王殿下为首的摄政委员会各位的健康，
    为西哈努克亲王殿下的健康，
    干杯！
