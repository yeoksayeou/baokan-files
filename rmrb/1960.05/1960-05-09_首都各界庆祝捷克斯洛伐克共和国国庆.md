Xinhua News Agency, May 8th. People from all walks of life in the capital gathered tonight to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia. Vice Premier He Long stated that the Chinese people fully support Comrade Khrushchev's solemn position on the international situation. Ambassador Bušiňák stated that all the people of Czechoslovakia support the struggle of all oppressed nations against imperialism and colonialism.

Xinhua News Agency, May 8th. Vice Premier He Long of the State Council solemnly stated today on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people that the Chinese government and the Chinese people fully support the Soviet government's solemn position on the summit meeting, and indignantly condemn the United States' aircraft for repeatedly invading Soviet airspace. He pointed out: The American aggressors' provocation against the Soviet Union is also a provocation against our China, and also a provocation against the entire socialist camp.

In his speech at the rally of people from all walks of life in the capital tonight celebrating the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia, Vice Premier He Long said: "The Four-Power Summit Conference will be held soon. Comrade Khrushchev recently clarified the Soviet government's solemn position on the summit conference at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and powerfully exposed and condemned the fact that U.S. imperialism insists on continuing the 'Cold War' and the arms race, and even directly provokes the Soviet Union in an attempt to undermine the true face of the summit conference. The Chinese government and the Chinese people fully support this solemn position of the Soviet government."

Vice Premier He Long pointed out: "We express our utmost indignation at the repeated violations of Soviet airspace by American aircraft. We believe that the American aggressors' provocation against the Soviet Union is also a provocation against our China, and also a provocation against the entire socialist camp. We firmly believe that this bandit behavior of U.S. imperialism can only expose its bellicose and brutal face once again in front of peace-loving people all over the world."

Vice Premier He Long solemnly stated: "The Chinese people are determined to unite with the people of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other socialist countries, and unite with all peace-loving countries and people in the world, heighten vigilance, strengthen the struggle, and strive to oppose the aggressive policies and war schemes of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, strive to ease international tensions, and safeguard world peace."

Vice Premier He Long's speech aroused extremely warm applause from the audience.

According to Xinhua News Agency, May 8th. More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand gathering in the auditorium of the CPPCC this evening to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia together with Czechoslovak comrades in Beijing.

Party and state leaders Zhu De, Peng Zhen, He Long, Shen Junru, Chen Shutong, etc., attended the celebration meeting.

The auditorium of the CPPCC, brightly illuminated by spotlights, was filled with a festive atmosphere. On the velvet curtain in the center of the rostrum, the national flags of China and Czechoslovakia were hung side by side, along with the words "1945-1960". The front of the rostrum was filled with blooming flowers and evergreen palm trees. Huge banners were hung inside and outside the venue: "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak people!" "Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" At 7:30, Zhu De, Peng Zhen, He Long and others, together with Czechoslovak Ambassador to China Jan Bušiňák, the head of the Czechoslovak friendship delegation Josef Obáfsky, and others, stepped onto the rostrum. At this time, all the people present stood up and applauded warmly, expressing fraternal congratulations to the Czechoslovak people who have made great achievements in socialist construction.

The meeting began with the solemn playing of the national anthems of Czechoslovakia and China.

Vice Premier He Long spoke first. He extended warm congratulations to the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the government, and the people on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people. (Full text to be published separately)

Ambassador Jan Bušiňák spoke amidst warm applause. He said that May 9, 1945, not only meant the national liberation of Czechoslovakia, but also meant that the Czechoslovak people had embarked on a stage of building a new and better socialist society. The Czechoslovak people will forever remember the unparalleled sacrifices made by the Soviet soldiers and the entire heroic Soviet people.

Ambassador Bušiňák said that the recent forcing of the hated Syngman Rhee to step down by the South Korean people, the fierce struggle of the Japanese people against the ratification of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and the various events in Turkey and other parts of the world, clearly show that the people of Asia, Africa, and South America are resolutely opposed to imperialism and colonialism, and that imperialism and colonialism are on the eve of total collapse. Our people fully support the just struggle of all oppressed and exploited nations, and firmly believe that no matter how the colonialists change their tactics and means, all oppressed and exploited nations will eventually be liberated.

Ambassador Bušiňák concluded by saying that all countries in the socialist camp have recently achieved brilliant successes in developing their economies, cultures, and improving the people's living standards. This is gratifying. The working people of Czechoslovakia are well aware that the assistance of the Soviet Union, the first country of workers and peasants, and the existence and assistance of the consolidated socialist camp play a great role in achieving these successes.

Josef Obáfsky, head of the Czechoslovak friendship delegation, extended cordial greetings to the Chinese people on behalf of the Czechoslovak people in his speech. When he spoke of the great achievements of the Czechoslovak people in building socialism, he said that today we are reaping the rich fruits of the enthusiastic and selfless labor of the past fifteen years. Our achievements are directly related to the achievements of the entire socialist camp. He said that the Czechoslovak people have always regarded the Soviet people as their shining example. Comrade Josef Obáfsky also pointed out that we defend everything that has been fought for and built up with blood and sweat, and will never allow the enemy to invade. Let the imperialists know that the strength we rely on is the revolutionary solidarity of the working people of all our countries, the immortal Marxist-Leninist doctrine, and the fighting experience of heroic and free people, and that no one can destroy our unity.

The speeches of Vice Premier He Long, Ambassador Bušiňák, and delegation leader Josef Obáfsky were warmly applauded by the audience.

Today's meeting was jointly sponsored by the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries of the People's Republic of China, the China-Czechoslovakia Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China, and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles.
