    “Broken Jade” Can Never Be Glued Together
    Su Hai
    Let Nobusuke Kishi, the traitorous Prime Minister of Japan, take a look at this photo: This is Japanese weaponry and a robber’s flag inscribed with “Lasting Military Fortune” that were captured by our Eighth Route Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan. This is the fate of imperialist invaders!
    In order to realize the aggressive ambitions of the Japanese monopoly capitalist group, Nobusuke Kishi disregards the national interests of Japan, disregards the Japanese people's demands for independence and peace, sells himself to the United States, desperately expands armaments, and revives militarism, attempting to relive the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Kishi's predecessors, in order to realize this dream, engaged in militarism and aggression for decades, but were crushed due to the resolute resistance of the Chinese and Asian people, and due to the Soviet Union's entry into the war. A character in Soviet writer Kim Roman's novel "A Diary Found in Sunchon"—a Japanese special agent—admits: "The jade is broken!" But they still dream: "The jade will be glued together." Kishi Nobusuke is now trying to glue together the fragments of "jade." However, this is in vain. The "jade" that was shattered by the people of the world can never be glued together. In the novel, an American officer said to that Japanese special agent: "After you surrendered, we thought of immediately replacing you in Asia, but Chiang Kai-shek put us in a difficult position. To be honest, what happened in China was a completely devastating tragedy." Today, a powerful new China stands tall in Asia, and a great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union stands tall in the world. Imperialism can no longer do whatever it wants. If, more than a decade ago, many Japanese people were poisoned by militarist education and sold their lives for the emperor and monopoly capital, then today the Japanese people's awareness has also greatly improved. Many veterans no longer want to sell their lives, women do not want their children to die in new wars of aggression, farmers are no longer deceived by the reactionary government, and the Japanese working class is heroically leading this struggle, they are confident of their victory. As Japanese worker Haruo Takeshita said: "We firmly believe that we will be victorious. We have witnessed so many workers and other people throughout the country united to fight against the new security treaty..." The Kishi Nobusuke group can no longer arbitrarily drive the people to be cannon fodder. Broken jade can never be glued together, let alone the fact that what the Kishi Nobusuke group wants to glue together is not jade at all, but garbage that is spurned by the people of Japan and the world!

### “碎玉”永远粘不起

    “碎玉”永远粘不起
    苏海
    让日本卖国首相岸信介看看这张照片吧：这是我国抗日战争中被我八路军缴获的日本武器和写着“武运长久”的强盗旗帜，这就是帝国主义侵略者的下场！
    岸信介为了实现日本垄断资本集团的侵略野心，不顾日本的民族利益，不顾日本人民争取独立、和平的要求，卖身投靠美国、拼命扩充军备，复活军国主义，企图重温“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦。岸信介的前辈们，为了想实现这个梦，穷兵黩武数十年之久，结果由于中国人民和亚洲人民的坚决抗战，由于苏联的出兵，而被粉碎了。苏联作家金罗曼的小说“在顺川发现的一本日记”中的人物——一个日本特务承认：“玉碎了！”但他们还梦想着：“玉还会被粘合起来的。”岸信介现在就在想粘合“玉”的碎片。可是，这是徒然的。被世界人民打得粉碎的“玉”，是永远也粘合不起来的。小说里一个美国军官对那个日本特务说：“你们投降以后，我们曾想着马上代替你们在亚洲的地位，但是蒋介石使我们处于困难的地位。老实说：在中国所发生的是完全复灭性的惨剧。”今天，在亚洲屹立着强大的新中国，在世界上屹立着以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营，帝国主义再也不能为所欲为了。如果说，十多年前，还有不少日本人中了军国主义教育的毒，为天皇和垄断资本卖命，那么，今天日本人民的觉悟也大大提高了，不少退伍军人已经不想再卖命，妇女们不想让自己的孩子在新的侵略战争中丧生，农民们不再受反动政府的欺骗，而日本的工人阶级，更是英勇地领导了这次斗争，他们确信着自己的胜利。正如日本工人竹下春男说的：“我们深信，我们将得到胜利。我们亲眼目睹全国有这么多的工人和其他的人一致为反对新安全条约而斗争……。”岸信介集团再也无法任意地驱使人民做炮灰。碎了的玉，尚且永远粘不起，何况岸信介集团想粘合的根本不是玉，而是被全日本、全世界人民唾弃的垃圾！
