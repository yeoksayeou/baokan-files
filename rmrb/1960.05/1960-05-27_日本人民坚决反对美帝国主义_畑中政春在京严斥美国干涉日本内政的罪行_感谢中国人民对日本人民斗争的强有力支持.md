Xinhua News Agency, May 26th. Hatanaka Seishun, secretary of the Japanese Peace Committee, who is currently visiting China, told reporters today that the magnificent struggle of the Japanese people to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and oppose the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is simultaneously developing into a struggle to resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialism that backs Kishi Nobusuke.

He pointed out that the purpose of the Japanese people's struggle is to abolish the "Security Treaty" and make Japan a truly independent country. He said that the Japanese people must free themselves from the multiple military, political, and economic shackles of U.S. imperialism.

Hatanaka Seishun strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for its increasingly blatant and open interference in the Japanese people's struggle and its support for the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique. He angrily criticized U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II for threatening Asanuma Inejirō, chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, in a very arrogant manner on the 24th, when Asanuma Inejirō went to the U.S. Embassy in Japan to deliver the Socialist Party's formal statement requesting the cancellation of Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

Hatanaka Seishun said that it is becoming increasingly clear that one of the purposes of the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique's hasty and hurried use of police violence to forcibly "pass" the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" was to prepare for Eisenhower's visit to Japan, and Eisenhower's visit to Japan after the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" was "passed" was to boost the morale of the Japanese reactionaries. He said that, therefore, in recent days, the Japanese people have been increasingly launching a movement to refuse Eisenhower's visit to Japan. He pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique's forcible "passage" of the "Security Treaty" has caused the struggle sweeping across Japan, in which broad masses of people from all walks of life participate, to develop to a new stage. People are flocking to Kishi Nobusuke's official residence and private home, the Diet, and the U.S. Embassy to demonstrate. He said that the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the largest trade union in Japan with more than 4.6 million members, has decided that the nationwide general strike to be held on June 4 will be of great significance and will severely strike the Kishi Nobusuke government. He also believes that the Japanese commercial strike, cultural gatherings to criticize the "Security Treaty," etc., will all be necessary.

Hatanaka Seishun deeply thanked the Chinese people for their strong support of the Japanese people's struggle. He said that from the huge mass rally supporting the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle in which he personally participated in China, it can be seen that the united and powerful Chinese people are so enthusiastically supporting the Japanese people's struggle, which moved me very much. This is a great encouragement to us Japanese people. I will definitely convey this enthusiasm of the Chinese people to the Japanese people as soon as possible.

    日本人民坚决反对美帝国主义
    畑中政春在京严斥美国干涉日本内政的罪行
    感谢中国人民对日本人民斗争的强有力支持
    新华社26日讯　正在我国进行访问的日本和平委员会书记畑中政春今天接见本社记者时指出，波澜壮阔的日本人民打倒岸信介内阁、反对日美新“安全条约”的斗争，正同时发展成为坚决反对岸信介的靠山美帝国主义的斗争。
    他指出，日本人民斗争的目的，是要废除“安全条约”，使日本真正成为独立的国家。他说，日本人民一定要从美帝国主义军事的、政治的、经济的重重束缚中解放出来。
    畑中政春强烈地谴责美帝国主义愈来愈露骨地公然干涉日本人民的斗争和支持岸信介反动集团。他愤怒地抨击了美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二在24日以非常横蛮的态度威胁日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎，当时浅沼稻次郎到美国驻日大使馆递交了社会党要求取消艾森豪威尔访问日本的正式声明。
    畑中政春说，人们越来越清楚地看到，岸信介反动集团那样迫不及待地匆匆忙忙以警察暴力强行“通过”日美新
  “安全条约”，其目的之一原来是为给艾森豪威尔访问日本作准备，而艾森豪威尔在日美“安全条约”被“通过”之后去日本访问，是为了给日本反动派打气。他说，因此，近几天来，日本人民正日益开展着拒绝艾森豪威尔访问日本的运动。他指出，岸信介反动集团用武力强行“通过  “安全条约”已使席卷日本全国、有各阶层广大群众参加的斗争发展到新的阶段。人们纷纷涌向岸信介的官邸和私人住宅、国会和美国大使馆示威。他说，日本最大的工会、拥有四百六十多万会员的日本工会总评议会决定在6月4日举行的全国性的总罢工，将具有重大的意义，它将沉重地打击岸信介政府。他还认为，日本商业总罢市、文化界人士集会抨击“安全条约”等都将是必要的。
    畑中政春深深感谢中国人民对日本人民的斗争的强有力的支持。他说，从他在中国亲身参加的支持日本人民爱国正义斗争的规模巨大的群众集会上，可以看出团结一致的、力量巨大的中国人民是那样热烈地支持日本人民的斗争，这使我非常感动。这是给我们日本人民的莫大的鼓舞。我一定要尽快地把中国人民这种热情传达给日本人民。
