Who can block the sun from shining its light and heat,
Who can stop the roar of the mighty wind,
Who can suppress the violent leaping of the ocean waves,
Who can prevent the struggle of the world's working people!

Flames, burn on!
Storms, howl away!
Ocean waves, surge and swell!
The people of Asia have risen!
The people of Africa have risen!
The people of Latin America have risen!
The people of the whole world have risen!

American imperialism, tremble!
Colonialism, shudder!
Fascism, die!
You will be like rats, bedbugs, flies, and mosquitoes,
Wiped out and eliminated by the awakened people!

    斗争的歌
    中共吉林白城地委第一书记　赵子平谁能遮住太阳不发光热，谁能挡住巨风的怒吼，谁能压住海洋的波涛暴跳，谁能阻止世界劳动人民的战斗！烈火呵你燃烧吧，风暴呵你呼啸吧，海洋的波涛啊你汹涌澎湃吧亚洲人民起来了，非洲人民起来了，拉丁美洲人民起来了，全世界人民都起来了！美帝国主义你发抖吧，殖民主义你战栗吧，法西斯主义你死亡吧，你们将像老鼠臭虫苍蝇蚊子一样，被觉醒了的人民清除消灭光！
