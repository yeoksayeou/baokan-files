To adapt to the needs of the development of urban communalized collective welfare undertakings, Tianjin is vigorously establishing street food processing stations.

    (Our report) Tianjin Municipality, in the vigorous urban people's commune movement, various streets have established large-scale mechanized and semi-mechanized staple food processing stations, non-staple food processing and vegetable distribution stations, and laundry stations to meet the needs of socializing housework and collectivizing life. As of May 20, the city has established 67 staple and non-staple food processing stations and 40 laundry stations, of which nine streets have all three stations, providing complete and networked services.

    With the rapid development of production and construction and the people's commune system, more and more women are participating in social production and service undertakings, and more and more people are requesting to join canteens. By the end of April, more than 8,600 street public canteens had been established in the city, with more than 800,000 people joining. In response to this situation, Zhengzhuangzi District Stores, under the leadership of the Hedong District Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Street Party Committee, established the first large-scale mechanized and semi-mechanized staple food processing station to process various staple foods for street canteens. As soon as this processing station was established, it was immediately welcomed by the masses. In the three days after the establishment of the processing station, the number of people joining the canteen doubled compared to the past. The new cooking utensils used in the processing station are generally complete and form a set, realizing mechanized and continuous production. While vigorously establishing staple food processing stations, various streets have also established mechanized laundry stations and non-staple food processing stations that cooperate with staple food processing stations. Each laundry station is equipped with washing machines and spin dryers, and uses steam pressing instead of heavy iron irons. The non-staple food processing station has a four-use vegetable cutting machine that can slice, shred, julienne, and chop fillings, as well as a meat cutting machine that can cut diced meat, shredded meat, and sliced meat, and a meat grinder.

    These large-scale mechanized and semi-mechanized staple and non-staple food processing stations and laundry stations, although established for a short time, the longest being just over a month, have already shown their advantages. First, they have greatly improved work efficiency, reduced the labor intensity of cooks and laundry workers, and saved a large amount of labor to support production and construction. The staple food processing stations and laundry stations with various mechanized cooking utensils have actually become large food production factories and laundry factories. These machines have high production efficiency. A dough mixer can mix a bag of flour (45 pounds) in one minute; a wowotou machine can produce 6,000 wowotou per hour, and a sesame cake machine can produce 3,000. A vegetable cutting machine can cut 1,000 pounds of vegetables per hour, and 120 pounds of steamed buns can be steamed in eight minutes using a five-pound pressure boiler. A six-meter-long oven can bake more than 500 sesame cakes in four minutes, and a staple food processing station can process 10,000 to 20,000 pounds of grain per day. Compared with using backward cooking utensils and manual operation, production efficiency has increased several times or dozens of times. What used to be done by twelve or thirteen people can now be done by one person, and the labor intensity is greatly reduced. After many small canteens were merged into medium-sized canteens, the number of cooks not only did not increase, but they also had a certain amount of time for cultural and political study every day. The washing machines in the mechanized laundry stations can wash an average of three or four pieces of clothing per minute, and the spin dryers can dry 20 pieces of clothing per minute, while manual washing takes a lot of time to wash one piece of clothing. Laundry workers describe this change by saying: "In the past, our hands never left the water and we leaned against the vat, our hands were soaked like peanuts, our arms ached so much we dared not raise them, and our legs stood in a bow-legged shape; now the machines replace us, the machines turn and turn, and thousands of pieces of clothing are washed." The Guozhuangzi Street Mechanized Laundry Station has only 36 service personnel, replacing the labor of 156 people in the twelve dismantling and washing teams in the entire street, and the delivery date has generally been shortened from ten days to two days, and the fees are low. Second, the establishment of staple food processing stations, etc., has further promoted the consolidation and development of urban commune collective welfare undertakings. The staple and non-staple food processing stations provide various canteens with a variety of delicious and inexpensive meals. Cooks no longer have to make staple foods, and only need to stir-fry the vegetables that have been cut and prepared by the processing station and make some soup for each meal, so they can concentrate on further improving the food and constantly innovate the variety of non-staple foods to make the food hot and the dishes fragrant, and improve the quality of service. Third, it has saved a lot of materials for the country. The staple food processing stations generally adopt new methods to make staple foods. The preservation rate of protein, carbohydrates, and fat in the staple foods made by this method is higher than that of the old method, which can save grain. At the same time, centralized processing can also save a lot of coal. Fourth, the establishment of staple food processing, etc., has further enriched the content of socialist commodity work. Commercial departments are fully responsible for everything from supplying the people's daily necessities to eating and washing clothes, truly becoming the people's "housekeepers."

    The key to Tianjin's ability to establish mechanized and semi-mechanized "three stations" in the past month or so lies in adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, strengthening the leadership of the Party, and vigorously carrying out mass movements. The district committees of various districts mobilized the forces of industry, commerce, and streets to promote the communist spirit of cooperation. The staff of the finance and trade departments tried every means to find materials; the industrial departments provided technology and manpower to design and manufacture equipment for the processing stations; the streets planned and adjusted housing for the establishment of processing stations, and the street residents actively participated in the labor of building houses. The Heping District Committee dispatched technicians from food, welfare, and coal construction companies to the site to explain the operation methods of various machines, and trained 300 staff members who mastered the operation of mechanized cooking utensils for the processing stations. Thanks to the cooperation of all parties, the processing stations were quickly built and put into production. In addition, these processing stations have all implemented the principles of simplicity and adapting to local conditions. They are either indigenous or foreign, or a combination of both.

    适应城市公社化集体福利事业发展需要
    天津大办街道食品加工站
    本报讯　天津市在大办城市人民公社运动中，各街道纷纷建立机械化、半机械化的大型主食加工站、副食加工配菜站和洗衣站，适应家务劳动社会化、生活集体化的需要。截至5月20日，全市已建立主副食加工站六十七个、洗衣站四十个，其中有九个街道“三站”俱全，服务成套成网。
    随着生产建设和人民公社化的迅速发展，有更多的妇女参加社会生产劳动和服务事业，要求加入食堂的人越来越多。到4月底，全市办起的街道公共食堂共八千六百多个，入伙人数有八十多万人。针对这种情况，郑庄子地区商店在中共河东区委和街党委的领导下，建起了第一个大型的机械化、半机械化的主食加工站，为街道食堂加工各种主食。这个加工站刚一建立，立刻受到群众的欢迎，在加工站建立后三天的时间里，食堂入伙人数比过去增加了一倍。加工站使用的新炊具，一般都成龙配套，实现机械化连续化的生产。各街道在大办主食加工站的同时，还建立起机械化的洗衣站，以及和主食加工站相配合的副食加工站。每个洗衣站都设有洗衣机、甩干机，并且利用汽烫代替了笨重的铁熨斗。副食加工站有可以切片、切丝、切条、剁馅的四用切菜机和切肉丁、肉丝、肉片的切肉机，还有搅肉机等。
    这些大型的机械化、半机械化的主副食加工站和洗衣站，虽然建立的时间很短，最长的只有一个多月，但是已经显示出它的优越性。首先，大大提高了工作效率，减轻了炊事员和洗衣员的劳动强度，节省了大批劳动力，支援生产建设。拥有各种机械化炊具的主食加工站和洗衣站，实际上已成为生产食品的大工厂和洗衣工厂。这些机器生产工效高，合面机一分钟合好一袋面（四十五斤）；窝头机每小时生产六千个，烧饼机生产三千个。切菜机一小时切一千斤菜，利用五磅气压的锅炉蒸汽，八分钟就可蒸熟一百二十斤馒头。六米长的烤炉每四分钟就可烤出五百多个烧饼，一个主食加工站每天能加工一两万斤粮食。同使用落后炊具和手工操作相比，生产效率成倍成十倍地增长，过去十二、三个人干的活，现在一个人就能胜任，而且劳动强度大大减轻。许多小食堂合并成中型食堂后，炊事员不但没有增加，反而每天都有一定的时间进行文化、政治学习。机械化洗衣站的洗衣机平均每分钟可以洗三、四件衣服，甩干机一分钟能甩干二十件衣服，而人工洗衣时洗一件衣服就要花费很多时间。洗衣人员形容这种变化说：“过去手不离水身靠缸，两手泡成花生样，胳膊疼的不敢扬，两腿站成罗圈样；现在机器代替我，机器转一转，洗好衣服千万件。”郭庄子街机械化洗衣站只有三十六个服务人员，代替了过去全街十二个拆洗组一百五十六人的劳动，交活日期一般也由过去的十天缩短到两天，而且收费低廉。其次，主食加工站等的建立，进一步促进了城市公社集体福利事业的巩固和发展。主副食加工站为各食堂配制出品种多样、味美价廉的饭菜，炊事员可不再作主食，每顿饭只需把加工站切好配好的菜炒炒和作些汤就行了，所以能够集中精力，进一步改进伙食，不断翻新副食花样，作到饭热菜香，提高了服务质量。第三，为国家节约了大量物资。各主食加工站普遍采用新法制作主食，用这种方法作出的主食中的蛋白质、醣类、脂肪的保存率比用旧法高，可以节约粮食。同时，集中加工还可以节约大量的煤炭。第四，主食加工等的建立，进一步丰富了社会主义商品工作的内容，商业部门从供应群众生活用品到吃饭、洗衣，全面负责到底，真正成为群众的“管家人”。
    天津市能够在最近一个多月的时间里，建立起机械化、半机械化的“三站”，关键在于坚持政治挂帅，加强党的领导，大搞群众运动。各区区委调动工业、商业、街道各方面的力量，大兴共产主义协作之风。财贸部门职工千方百计寻找物料；工业部门出技术出人力，为加工站设计和制造设备；街道为开办加工站筹划调剂房屋，街道居民积极参加修建房屋的劳动。和平区委抽调饮食、福利、煤建等公司的技术人员，到现场讲解各种机器的操作方法，为加工站培养了三百名掌握机械化炊具操作的工作人员。由于各方面的协作，保证了加工站迅速建成投入生产。此外，这些加工站都贯彻了因陋就简，因地制宜的原则，都是能土则土，能洋则洋，或土洋并举办起来的。
