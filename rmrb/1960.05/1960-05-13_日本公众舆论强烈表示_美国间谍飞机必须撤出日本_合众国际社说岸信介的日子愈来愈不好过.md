Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 12th: Two Tokyo daily newspapers published editorials today, expressing serious concern about the United States' use of Japanese bases for espionage activities, and unanimously demanded that the United States withdraw U-2 spy planes from Japan as soon as possible.

"Tokyo Shimbun" said, "We cannot agree with the U.S. explanation that the missions carried out by the three U-2 jet aircraft based in Japan are different from those of other aircraft of the same type. If that were the case, there would be no need to paint them black to prevent radar detection. This simple suspicion alone is enough to make the Japanese people doubt the purpose and activities of the black jet aircraft."

The editorial continued, "It is not appropriate to have aircraft in Japan that will become the source of unease for the Japanese people... The Japanese government must demand that the United States withdraw these aircraft from Japan."

"Yomiuri Shimbun," in an editorial entitled "U-2 Aircraft and Our Anxiety," said that a country that allows black jet aircraft to be stationed on its own territory must feel uneasy about the questions raised by recent events.

The editorial pointed out that it is no exaggeration to say that Khrushchev's revelations have had a profound psychological impact in Japan. The editorial also said, "It is absolutely important to guarantee clearly and unequivocally that we will not be dragged into a war that has nothing to do with us."

United Press International admitted that Kishi Nobusuke's days are getting harder. It said, "These are bad days for Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke." The pro-Western Kishi Nobusuke government is "facing one trouble after another today" -- the Soviet Union issued a warning about U.S. spy planes, Beijing held a rally of one million people against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and the United States and Kishi Nobusuke were attacked in the Japanese Diet by opposition party members.

At the same time, the people of Yamato City, Kanagawa Prefecture (where the so-called "black jet aircraft" are said to be based) are demanding that "U-2" aircraft be withdrawn from their city.

Approximately forty representatives from the Japan Education and Welfare Association and two women's groups met in a public school on the 11th and unanimously agreed to launch a broad campaign to demand the withdrawal of these aircraft from Japan.

    日本公众舆论强烈表示
    美国间谍飞机必须撤出日本
    合众国际社说岸信介的日子愈来愈不好过
    据新华社12日讯　东京消息：东京两家日报今天发表社论，对美国利用日本基地进行间谍活动表示严重不安，并且一致要求美国把U—2型间谍飞机尽早撤出日本。
    “东京新闻”说，“我们不能同意美国的这种解释：以日本为基地的三架U—2型喷气式飞机所进行的任务跟同一类型的其他飞机是不同的。如果这样的话，那就不需要把它们漆成黑色以防雷达的侦测。光是这一个简单的怀疑，已经足以使日本人怀疑黑色喷气式飞机的目的和活动了。”
    社论继续说，“日本境内有这种将成为日本人不安的根源的飞机，那是不适宜的……日本政府必须要求美国把这些飞机撤出日本。”
    “读卖新闻”在一篇题为“U—2型飞机和我们的焦虑”的社论中说，允许黑色喷气式飞机驻在自己国土上的国家，对于最近的事件所提出的问题一定感到不安。
    社论指出，可以毫不夸大地说，赫鲁晓夫揭露的情况，在日本引起了深刻的心理影响。社论还说，
  “绝对明确地保证我们不会被卷入一个同我们没有关系的战争中去，是绝对重要的。”
    合众国际社承认，岸信介的日子愈来愈不好过。它说，“对岸信介首相来说，这几天是不好的日子”。亲西方的岸信介政府“今天碰到的麻烦事情一件接着一件”——苏联对美国的间谍飞机提出警告，北京举行了有一百万人参加的反对日美“安全条约”的大会，美国和岸信介在日本国会遭到反对党议员的抨击。
    同时，神奈川县大和市（据说那里是所谓的“黑色喷气式飞机”的基地）的人民要求把“U—2型”飞机撤出他们的城市。
    日本教育福利协会和两个妇女团体的大约四十名代表11日在一所公立学校里开会，一致同意发动广泛的运动来要求这种飞机撤出日本。
