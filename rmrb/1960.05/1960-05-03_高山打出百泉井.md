Party Committee Secretary's Notes

    Drawing Spring Water from Wells on High Mountains
    Yao Zuodong, First Secretary of the Chengchuan People's Commune Committee, Huicheng County, Gansu Province
    The weather is clear, the sky is cloudless, and spring fills Zao’er Gully. Peach and plum blossoms along the banks of the gully compete in beauty, adorning Zao’er Gully with a vibrant scene. We climbed Ran’s Family Mountain on the south side of Zao’er Gully with boundless excitement. Looking north, it is truly beautiful. Nine gullies and eighteen bends, terraces all over the mountains, every piece of land has ridges, and the ridges are connected to each other. This used to be a gully stream fifteen *li* long, but today it has become extraordinarily moving. All fifteen *li* of the gully stream have been turned into 153 *mu* of paddy fields, winding from the foot of the northern mountain to Zhiqi River, strung together into a crystal-clear jade belt. Large and small ponds and dams are built at the mouths of each bay and gully, like gems inlaid in Zao’er Gully, reflecting water and sky, sparkling dazzlingly. The crisscrossing canals and the more than 2,100 *mu* of green wheat fields on both sides of the gully head are divided into terraces, one after another, like a beautiful carpet. On the highway running through the entire gully, cars and horse-drawn carriages come and go, echoing day and night.
    Following the Party's instructions and the demands of the people, the people of Zao'er Gully began to conquer the mountains and fight the water, building ponds and dams, managing the gully slopes, and diverting water up the mountains, so that Zao'er Gully began to change its character and benefit the people. The mountain slopes and terraced fields have become irrigated land, and the muddy gullies have become paddy fields. The wishes of the people of Zao'er Gully for many years have been realized. When they ate the first bowl of rice produced in Zao'er Gully and drank the rice soup produced in Zao'er Gully, the whole gully sang songs of happiness.
    Last winter was dry, and this spring was droughty. This deep gully, which people used to call "fertile gully, lean ridge, and thin land," was tested. After completing the battle of conquering the mountains and fighting the water, the people of Zao'er Gully, in order to make drought resistance and production even better, re-embroider Zao'er Gully, and correspondingly issued the battle cry of "The sky is dry, but the heart is not dry; the ground is dry, but the heart is not dry; resist the drought until the sky bows its head; we will not give up until we win a bumper harvest; draw spring water from wells on high mountains; a bumper harvest depends on people, not on heaven."
    It was already twelve o'clock at night. The night was so dark, but people were still so enthusiastically, actively, and in every possible way discussing the matter of finding water sources. This discussion was held in the office of the brigade headquarters. Girls, young men, old farmers, and cadres were arguing and offering suggestions for digging and irrigating one *mu* of land per person. Amid the discussion, a middle-aged man of medium build suddenly entered through the door. He was Yang Guodong, the Party Branch Secretary who led the people of Zao'er Gully in managing the mountains and water and turning from poverty to prosperity. He had just returned from a drought resistance and production meeting in the commune, and he talked to everyone with a smile: "The drought is severe, the task is arduous, and irrigating wheat is the top priority at present. If we don't do it well, wheat production will be reduced, which will affect national construction and our lives. To solve this problem, the Party committee calls on us to dig wells on high mountains and tap springs beside slopes. This is a new task for the people of Zao'er Gully."
    This was an extraordinary battle. In the past, no one had ever dared to think of digging wells and tapping springs on this high mountain more than 1,100 meters above sea level. But the people of Zao'er Gully, located in an arid area, and the broad masses of the people, regarded the matter of digging wells and tapping springs on high mountains as good news. Water is the lifeline of the people of Zao'er Gully. Agricultural production cannot be separated from water. Water is grain. The people of Zao'er Gully understand this more deeply. Although more than 60 water sources have been found, the heavy hoe for digging soil and removing soil cannot adapt to the use of high speed and high work efficiency, and has become a new problem in their well digging and spring tapping. The Party branch again convened a "Zhuge Liang meeting" of vanguard team members, Party and League cadres, and carpenters, and issued the call to ask for time from tools, to ask for labor from tools, to ask for water from tools, to ask for grain from tools, and to march toward nature. A fierce battle began. A mighty army of heroes and strong soldiers rushed to the mountains and bays to fight a great battle on the mountain tops and make a big fuss in the well clusters. During the day, red flags were waving, and songs shook the mountains and valleys. Party members contracted wells, League members contracted springs, and cadres contracted mountain tops. Everywhere was full of people. At night, bright lights and torches illuminated the sky. The masses led by the Party are the source of wisdom and strength. Hundreds of skillful hands made digging tools and wooden pulleys. Soil mechanization was implemented on the construction site. Chen Guiying from Manzhuang, who was only about twenty years old, was a member of the Communist Youth League. She got up when the rooster crowed and went to work before the stars came out. She and Zhu Zhilan contracted a spring and compared themselves with the young men. In order to dig out the water ahead of time, they thought day and night. Suddenly, they thought that the spinning wheel could turn automatically without being shaken by hand. Wouldn't it be the same if they made a frame to carry it at the wellhead? So they used the spinning wheel as a model and created a soil hoisting device.
    The early spring sunshine shone in Zao'er Gully, looking like a peach-red and willow-green scene. Spring brought warmth to Zao'er Gully. But the high mountains were still very cold, and it was a little unbearable in the morning and evening. Unfortunately, the weather changed that day. A cold wind blew, and the cold air invaded people. Early in the morning, Yang Guodong took off his shoes and socks as usual, rolled up his trousers, jumped down the well, and went to work. The young men around him jumped into the water one after another without saying a word and started working. The water was cold, but their hearts were warm, and everyone was sweating on their legs. Yang Guodong left a very deep impression on people. From then on, this well on the mountain was called "Secretary's Well" by the people.
    What is the source of power for people to conquer the mountains and ridges of Zao'er Gully and create miracles? It is the great power of the Party and the People's Commune. It is the battle drum of the Great Leap Forward that has awakened the water, which has been sleeping in the depths of the underground for thousands of years, to serve the will of the people. The irrigated land has been expanded from more than 500 *mu* to more than 1,000 *mu*.
    Now, on the more than ten barren mountains and bald ridges where heroes fought hard, there is a windbreak forest belt that is twelve *li* long and three *zhang* wide with green trees. The former Miao’er Bay has now become Jiulongkou, which has been built into a string of springs and a string of wells, spitting out underground treasures for the people of Zao’er Gully. They installed three waterwheels, two dragon bone waterwheels, and five artificial rainmakers. Ran Jinrui, who had never gone to school since he was a child, is now a water conservancy technician here, running around all day installing waterwheels for the wells and springs in Zao'er Gully. People who had never been to school for generations now have more than 100 children in primary school, and more than 100 young and middle-aged people have been literate, cultivating a new generation and construction talents for the country. This year, in this drought situation, there are still many people attending work. They have reclaimed more than 500 *mu* of wasteland. The land area has increased sharply by 50% compared with the previous year. Now the heroes are embroidering new flowers on the beautiful mountains and rivers.

    高山打出百泉井
    中共甘肃徽成县成川公社委员会第一书记　姚作栋
    天气晴朗，万里无云，一片春色充满了枣儿沟。沿沟两岸的桃李花香，竞春争艳，为枣儿沟缀上了一副鲜明图景。我们以无比兴奋的心情，登上了枣儿沟南面的冉家山。向北眺望，真是美气，九沟十八湾，遍山台台田，地地有埂，埂埂相连。以前这里是一个长达十五华里的沟溪，今天它已变得格外动人了。十五华里的沟溪全部修成了一百五十三亩沟溪稻田，从北山脚下弯弯曲曲地伸向了支旗川，串成了一条晶莹的玉带，各个湾沟口，修筑了大大小小塘坝，就像镶在枣儿沟的宝石，水天相映，闪闪耀眼。那纵横交织的渠道，沟头两畔青绿如茵的两千一百多亩麦田，划成了一台一台，一块一块，宛如美丽的地毯，在纵贯全沟的公路上，汽车、马车来来往往，日夜回响。
    枣儿沟人民遵循着党的指示和人民群众的要求，开始了征山战水，修塘筑坝，沟坡治理，引水上山，使枣儿沟开始改变了性格，造福于人民山坡梯田变成了水浇田，烂泥沟变成稻田，多少年来，枣儿沟人民的愿望实现了。他们吃上了枣儿沟出产的第一碗大米饭时，喝上枣儿沟自产的大米汤时，全沟人就唱起了幸福的赞歌。
    去年冬干，今年春旱，这条过去人称沟肥、梁瘦、地薄的深沟得到考验。枣儿沟人民在完成征山战水的战斗之后，为使抗旱生产更上一层楼，再绣枣儿沟，相应地又发出了“天旱心不旱，地干心不干，抗旱抗到天低头，不夺丰收心不休；高山打出百泉井，丰收由人不由天”的战斗号角。
    已经是深夜十二点的时候了，夜那么深，但人们还是那么热烈地、积极地、万计千方地讨论着寻找水源的事。这个讨论会是在大队部的办公室里开的，姑娘、小伙子、老农、干部们正在争持着为每人刨灌一亩田而献策献计。在众人讨论声中，忽然从门里进来了一个中等身材的中年人，他就是领导枣儿沟人民治山治水，由穷变富的总支书记杨国栋。他刚从公社里开罢抗旱生产会议回来，带着笑和大家谈起话来：“旱象严重，任务艰巨，抗旱浇麦是当前的头等大事，弄不好，小麦就要减产，也就要影响国家的建设和我们的生活。为了解决这个问题，党委号召我们高山打井，坡旁挖泉，这是我们枣儿沟人民的新任务。”
    这是一场不平凡的战斗，过去哪有人在这海拔一千一百多米的高山上打井掏泉，人们甚至连想也没敢想过。但是地处干旱的枣儿沟人民和广大群众，他们把高山打井掏泉的事，当作一个福音。水就是枣儿沟人民的命脉，发展农业生产离不了水，水就是粮食，枣儿沟人民体会得更深刻。虽然找出了六十多处水源，但笨重的镢头挖土，出土不能适应高速度和高工效的使用，已成为他们打井掏泉中的一个新的难题。党支部又召集了尖兵队员，党团干部和木匠，就地召开了“诸葛亮会”，提出了向工具要时间，向工具要劳力，向工具要水，向工具要粮，向自然进军的号召。激烈的战斗开始了，雄兵健将、浩浩荡荡奔赴山间梁湾大战山头，大闹井群。白天红旗招展，歌声震撼山岳，党员包井、团员包泉、干部包山头，到处一片人，夜晚明灯火把，红光烛天。党领导的群众就是智慧力量的源泉，用成百的巧手制成了掘土器、木滑轮。工地上实行了土机械化，满庄的陈桂英，年纪不过二十上下，是一个共青团员，她鸡叫起床星不出来就上工，她和朱之兰包了一眼泉，和小伙子们比了高低。她们为提前挖出水，朝思暮想，忽然想起纺线轮不用手摇可以自动转，如果做个架子担在井口不是同样能行吗？于是她们就用纺线轮为式样，创制了吊土器。
    初春的阳光照耀在枣儿沟里，看去一片桃红柳绿，阳春为枣儿沟带来了温暖。但高山还是很冷，早晚有些站不住。不巧那天天象变挂，冷风吹来，寒气侵人。一清早，杨国栋照样脱去了鞋袜，卷起了裤腿，纵身一跳，下井去了，周围的小伙子都一声不吭接二连三地跳下水去就干，水冷心热，个个腿上都出了汗。杨国栋给人们留下了极为深刻的印象，从此山上的这眼井，就被人们称为“书记井”。
    什么是人们征服枣儿沟群山千岭创造奇迹的力量源泉呢？是党、是人民公社的巨大威力，是大跃进的战鼓，唤醒了千年沉睡的蕴藏在地下深处的水，为人们的意志服务。水浇地由五百多亩扩大到一千多亩。
    现在，英雄苦战的十多个荒山秃岭上，出现了一条长达十二华里，宽三丈绿树成荫的防风林带。过去的庙儿湾，现在变成九龙口，修成了泉串泉，井串井，为枣儿沟人民吐出了地下宝。他们安装起了三部水车，两个龙骨水车，五个人工降雨器。从小就没念过书的冉锦瑞已是这里的一个水利技术员，整天在东奔西跑，为枣儿沟的井泉安装水车。从前世世代代人没有进过学校的人们，现在已有一百多名孩子进了小学，并有一百多个青壮年扫了盲，为国家培养着新的一代和建设人才。今年在这干旱的情况下，出勤的人仍然很多，他们已经开垦了荒地五百多亩，土地面积与前年相比，猛增了50％，如今英雄们又在大好山川上刺绣新的花朵了。
