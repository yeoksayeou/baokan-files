Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th (TASS): Soviet Premier Khrushchev delivered a concluding speech at the USSR Supreme Soviet meeting here this afternoon regarding the representatives' discussions. He noted with satisfaction that all speakers at the meeting fully agreed with and unanimously supported the Soviet government's proposals on abolishing taxes on workers and staff and completing the transition to shortened working hours for all workers and staff in 1960. He said that the representatives unanimously supported the Soviet government's domestic and foreign policies in their speeches.

Khrushchev particularly emphasized the need to build a strong construction industry in order to successfully complete the construction project plans set out in the Seven-Year Plan.

Khrushchev announced: "The pilot of the downed American aircraft is alive and well, and he is now in Moscow. The wreckage of the plane and the instruments found during the investigation have also been transported here. The pilot's name is Francis Gary Powers. He is thirty years old this year. He is a captain in the U.S. Air Force. He served in the Air Force until 1956, when he transferred to work for the Central Intelligence Agency."

Khrushchev pointed out that the U.S. Air Force's aggressive actions against the Soviet Union have aroused the righteous anger of the representatives and all Soviet people. He said that the official statements by American officials regarding the American aircraft shot down over Soviet airspace on May 1 were pure fabrications.

Khrushchev pointed out that, according to the American pilot's confession, he had not been dizzy at all, nor was there any damage to the oxygen cylinders. He was flying according to the route instructed to him in advance, accurately carrying out the instructions of his superiors, operating the switches of the instruments over predetermined targets in order to collect intelligence on Soviet military and industrial targets.

Khrushchev said that the authoritative committee of experts determined after studying the downed aircraft that this high-altitude "Lockheed U-2 type" aircraft was specifically designed for aerial reconnaissance. The mission of this aircraft was to traverse the entire territory of the Soviet Union from the Pamirs to the Kola Peninsula in order to reconnaissance Soviet military and industrial targets by means of aerial photography.

The head of the Soviet government showed the representatives some of the photos, on which military airfields, gas depots, and industrial enterprises could be seen—these are conclusive material evidence of the American aircraft's espionage activities. According to Khrushchev, the plane was shot down in Sverdlovsk.

Khrushchev went on to say that the American aircraft that intruded into Soviet territory flew more than two thousand kilometers over Soviet territory, flying in the air for a total of about four hours. The aircraft was monitored all the time, and as soon as the order was issued, it was shot down.

Khrushchev said that, according to the spy Powers' confession, he flew from Adana, Turkey, to Peshawar Airport in Pakistan on April 27. On May 1, pilot Powers took off from Peshawar Airport in Pakistan, and not from a Turkish airport near Adana as the U.S. State Department said; his mission was to fly along the route marked on his map over the Aral Sea, Sverdlovsk, and other locations to Arkhangelsk and Murmansk, and then land at Bodø Airport in Norway.

Khrushchev also said that the aircraft was equipped with a time bomb underneath. In order to destroy the evidence, the pilot was instructed not to be captured alive by the Soviet authorities. To this end, the pilot carried a specially made pin. He was instructed that, if necessary, he would stick this poison-tipped pin into himself, which would cause instant death.

Khrushchev pointed out that this pilot, who was supposedly studying the atmosphere, received 7,500 rubles in Soviet currency. He also received French gold francs, as well as currencies from West Germany and Italy. In addition, in addition to his own watch, he received two gold watches and seven women's gold rings for this flight.

Khrushchev said: "We warn once again from the lofty rostrum of the Supreme Soviet those countries that provide territory for hostile aircraft to take off to attack our country: do not play with fire!"

Khrushchev said that the governments of Turkey, Pakistan, and Norway should clearly realize that they are accomplices in this aggression because they allowed their airports to be used against the Soviet Union. This is by no means a friendly gesture. This is a hostile act towards the Soviet Union on their part.

Khrushchev said that the reason he talked about all this in detail was to refute the U.S. State Department's very clumsy fabrications and to tell the public in all countries, including the American public, about the conclusive facts about the American aggression against the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev stated that it would be appropriate to hold a special press conference to display the various equipment and weapons of the American pilot who violated Soviet airspace.

Khrushchev added, "Furthermore, I think it would be correct to raise the issue of trying this pilot."

Khrushchev said: "Currently, we believe that this act of aggression by the American aircraft that violated our country's borders is an attempt to create tension and revive the 'Cold War.' This is not yet preparation for war today. However, this provocative act of aggression is preparation for future war. It is precisely for this reason that we so resolutely expose this act of aggression."

Khrushchev pointed out that the U.S. aircraft incident does not help to peacefully resolve international disputes. However, the Soviet Union will not therefore increase its appropriations for armaments and troops, stop the process of reducing troops, and will continue to adhere to a peace-loving policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th: The Soviet Supreme Soviet's Council of the Union and Council of Nationalities held a joint meeting today and approved the laws on abolishing taxes on workers and staff and on completing the transition to a seven- to six-hour workday for all workers and staff in 1960. The meeting also passed the Soviet Council of Ministers' resolution on raising the standard of the monetary unit tenfold from January 1, 1961, and issuing new currency. The meeting unanimously adopted the resolution approving the Soviet government's activities in domestic and foreign policy.

At today's meeting, nine representatives spoke on the second item on the agenda. They unanimously pointed out that the decision to shorten the working day is a manifestation of the high level of development of the Soviet national economy. This measure is also another manifestation of the concern of the Soviet Communist Party and government for the people's lives. The Soviet people sincerely thank the Party and government for their care and will continue to work hard to develop production, increase labor productivity, accelerate the early completion of the Seven-Year Plan, and further strengthen the power of the national economy.

Those who spoke at the meeting unanimously expressed immense anger at the U.S. imperialist aircraft's violation of the Soviet Union. They also pointed out that no provocation by imperialism can intimidate the long-tempered Soviet people and the Soviet armed forces. The Soviet people are closely united around the Party and the government and continue to fight to defend the security of the motherland.

Next, K. Voroshilov's speech was read out at the meeting. In his speech, Voroshilov stated that, due to poor health, he requested the Soviet Supreme Soviet to relieve him of his duties as Chairman of the Presidium of the Soviet Supreme Soviet.

Khrushchev then proposed on behalf of the CPSU Central Committee to agree to Voroshilov's request.

Khrushchev said, "I think we should thank K. Voroshilov. He has worked for many years, he is a loyal son of the Party, one of the participants in the founding of the Party, and he defended the cause of the Party on the fronts of the civil war."

Khrushchev said that all of Voroshilov's labor and all of his activities were for the happiness of the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, for the development of the Communist Party.

Khrushchev proposed awarding K. Voroshilov the title of Hero of Socialist Labor to commend his outstanding contributions to the Communist Party and the Soviet state.

Khrushchev said that the CPSU Central Committee nominated Leonid Brezhnev to serve as Chairman of the Presidium of the Soviet Supreme Soviet.

Khrushchev said that Brezhnev is an outstanding social activist. He is a member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and has been elected as a representative to the Soviet Supreme Soviet three times.

The Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting accepted K. Voroshilov's request, relieved him of his duties as Chairman of the Presidium of the Soviet Supreme Soviet, and approved the order to award K. Voroshilov the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, as well as awarding him the Order of Lenin and the "Hammer and Sickle" gold medal.

The meeting passed the resolution on electing L. Brezhnev as Chairman of the Presidium of the Soviet Supreme Soviet.

The meeting also elected Voroshilov as a member of the Presidium of the Soviet Supreme Soviet.

L. Brezhnev made a brief speech at the meeting, thanking the representatives for their trust in him.

The meeting approved the order on abolishing the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs and the order on certain amendments to the Law on State Preferential Treatment, as well as some other decrees.

The Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting hereby declares its conclusion.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th (TASS, Moscow): The Fifth Session of the Soviet Supreme Soviet concluded the discussion of Khrushchev's report on abolishing taxes on workers and staff on the morning of the 6th. The meeting adopted a resolution based on Representative Demichev's proposal, supporting the activities of the Soviet Council of Ministers in domestic and foreign policy.

On the afternoon of the 6th, the meeting began the second item on the agenda: measures on completing the transition to shortened working days for all workers and staff in 1960. The meeting heard reports on this item on the agenda by Volkov, Chairman of the State Committee on Labor and Wages of the Soviet Council of Ministers, and Grishin, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions.

Volkov said in his report that as of April 1 this year, approximately sixteen million workers in the Soviet Union had already transitioned to a seven-hour or six-hour workday.

By the end of this year, another forty-three million people will transition to a seven-hour or six-hour workday.

Volkov listed materials to illustrate that the Soviet Union's production level is still constantly improving while shortening the working day.

Volkov pointed out that the wages of Soviet workers and staff are constantly increasing while shortening the working day. For example, the average wage of each worker in the metallurgical industry sector increased by 1,500 rubles per year, and the average wage of each worker and staff in the chemical industry sector increased by 1,200 rubles per year.

Volkov emphasized that the essence of all the measures implemented by the Soviet state aimed at improving the lives of the working people is determined by the essence of the socialist system. He said that providing a large portion of social wealth to the Soviet working people free of charge will make labor the people's primary need.

Grishin, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, emphasized in his report that the Soviet working people have achieved remarkable accomplishments in developing the socialist economy and greatly improving the material welfare and cultural level of the working people.

After the reports by Volkov and Grishin, the meeting then began discussing their reports. After the representative from Uzbekistan spoke, the meeting adjourned.

    赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上指出
    美国对苏联的侵略证据确凿
    会议批准关于取消职工赋税和缩短工作日的法律
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科7日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫今天下午在这里举行的苏联最高苏维埃会议上就代表们的讨论发表了结束语。他满意地指出，所有在会上发言的人都完全同意和一致拥护苏联政府关于取消工人和职员的赋税和在1960年完成全体工人和职员向缩短工作日过渡的建议。他说，代表们在发言中一致拥护苏联政府的内外政策。
    赫鲁晓夫特别强调指出，必须建立强大的建筑工业，以便胜利完成七年计划制定的建筑工程计划。
    赫鲁晓夫宣布：“被击落的美国飞机的飞行员还活着，而且健康，他现在在莫斯科。这架飞机的残骸和在调查过程中发现的仪器也运到了这里。这个飞行员的名字叫做弗朗西斯·哈里·鲍尔士。今年三十岁。他是美国空军上尉、他在空军任职到1956年，即到他转到中央情报局供职时为止。”
    赫鲁晓夫指出，美国空军对苏联采取的侵略行动激起了代表们和全体苏联人民的正当的愤怒。他说，美国负责人士关于5月1日在苏联领空被击落的美国飞机的官方说法，纯粹是捏造。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，据美国飞行员供认，他丝毫也未曾头晕，而且也没有什么氧气筒损坏的事情。他是按照事先指示他的路线飞行，准确地执行他的上级的指示，在预定目标上空操纵仪器的开关，以便收集苏联的军事和工业目标的情报。
    赫鲁晓夫说，权威的专家委员会研究了被击落的飞机后确定，这架高空飞行的“洛克希德U—2型”飞机是专供进行空中侦察用的。这架飞机的任务是从帕米尔到科拉半岛穿越苏联全部领土，以便用空中摄影的方法侦察苏联的军事和工业目标。
    苏联政府首脑把一部分照片拿给代表们看，在照片上可以看到军用机场、汽油库、工业企业——这是美国飞机进行间谍活动的确凿的物证。据赫鲁晓夫说，这架飞机是在斯维德洛夫斯克被击落的。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，侵入苏联国境的美国飞机在苏联领土上空飞过了两千多公里，在空中飞行了共计约四小时。飞机在这一时间内一直受到监视，一当命令发出，它就被击落了。
    赫鲁晓夫说，据间谍鲍尔士供认，他在4月27日从土耳其亚达那城飞到巴基斯坦的白沙瓦机场。5月1日飞行员鲍尔士就从巴基斯坦的白沙瓦机场起飞，而并不是像美国国务院所说那样从亚达那市附近的土耳其机场起飞，他的任务是沿着在他的地图标出的航线飞过咸海、斯维德洛夫斯克和其他地点上空，到阿尔汗格尔斯克和摩尔曼斯克，然后到挪威的布德机场着落。
    赫鲁晓夫还说，这架飞机下面装有定时炸弹。为了灭除罪迹，飞行员被教导不得为苏联当局活擒。为此，这个飞行员身上带了一枚特制的别针。他受命在必要时就用这枚带毒药的针往自己身上扎，便会立刻致死。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，这个据说是要研究大气的飞行员拿到了七千五百卢布的苏联币。他还得到了法国的金法郎以及西德和意大利等国的货币。此外，除了他自己的手表以外，他还因这次飞行而得到了两只金表和七个女式金戒指。
    赫鲁晓夫说：“我们从最高苏维埃的崇高讲台上再一次警告提供领土让敌对的飞机向我国起飞的那些国家：不要玩火！”
    赫鲁晓夫说，土耳其、巴基斯坦和挪威三国政府应当清楚地意识到，它们是这次侵犯的同谋者，因为它们允许自己的机场被用来反对苏联。这决不是友好的表现。这是它们方面对苏联的敌视行动。
    赫鲁晓夫说，他之所以详细地谈到所有这一切，是为了驳斥美国国务院十分拙劣的捏造，并把关于美国对苏联的侵略行动的确凿事实告诉世界各国的公众，其中包括美国的公众。
    赫鲁晓夫表示，举行专门的记者招待会，来展出侵犯苏联领空的美国飞行员的各种设备和武器，是适宜的。
    赫鲁晓夫补充说，此外，我想，提出审判这个飞行员的问题，将是正确的。
    赫鲁晓夫说：目前我们认为侵犯我国国境的美国飞机的这一侵略行动，是企图使神经紧张起来，使“冷战”复燃。这暂且还不是今天战争的准备。但是，这一挑衅性的侵略行动是未来战争的准备。正因为如此，所以我们这样坚决地揭露这种侵略行动。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，美国飞机事件无助于和平解决国际争端。但是苏联将不因此而增加对军备和军队的拨款，停止裁减军队的过程，并将继续遵循爱好和平政策。
    新华社莫斯科7日电　苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院今天举行联席会议，批准了关于取消工人和职员赋税和关于在1960年完成全体工人和职员向七—六小时工作日过渡的法律。会议还通过了苏联部长会议关于从1961年1月1日起把货币单位标准提高到十倍和发行新货币的决议。会议一致通过了关于赞同苏联政府在内外政策方面所进行的活动的决议。
    在今天的会议上有九位代表就第二项议程发了言。他们一致指出，缩短工作日的决定是苏联国民经济高度发展的表现。这一措施也是苏联共产党和政府关怀人民生活的又一表现。苏联人民衷心感谢党和政府的关怀，并将继续努力发展生产，提高劳动生产率，加速提前完成七年计划，进一步增强国民经济的力量。
    在会上发言的人一致对美帝国主义飞机侵犯苏联表示无比的愤怒。他们并指出，帝国主义的任何挑衅都不能吓倒久经锻炼的苏联人民和苏联武装力量。苏联人民紧紧地团结在党和政府的周围，继续为保卫祖国安全而奋斗。
    接着，会上宣读了克·伏罗希洛夫的发言。伏罗希洛夫在发言中表示，由于健康情况不佳，他提请苏联最高苏维埃免除他的苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席的职务。
    赫鲁晓夫随后代表苏共中央提出建议，同意伏罗希洛夫提出的这一请求。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我认为，我们应当感谢克·伏罗希洛夫。他工作了很多年，他是党的忠实儿子，是参加建党人之一，他在国内战争前线上保卫了党的事业。
    赫鲁晓夫说，伏罗希洛夫的全部劳动和全部活动，都是为了苏联各族人民的幸福，为了共产党的发展。
    赫鲁晓夫建议授予克·伏罗希洛夫社会主义劳动英雄的称号，以表彰他对共产党和苏维埃国家的杰出的功绩。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏共中央举荐列昂尼德·勃列日涅夫担任苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席。
    赫鲁晓夫说，勃列日涅夫是杰出的社会活动家。他是苏共中央主席团委员，三次当选为苏联最高苏维埃代表。
    苏联最高苏维埃会议接受了克·伏罗希洛夫的请求，免去他的苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席的职务，并批准了关于授予克·伏罗希洛夫社会主义劳动英雄称号，以及授予他列宁勋章和“镰刀和锤子”金质奖章的命令。
    会议通过了关于推选列·勃列日涅夫为苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席的决议。
    会议还选举伏罗希洛夫为苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员。
    列·勃列日涅夫在会上作了简短讲话，感谢各位代表对他的信任。
    会议批准了关于撤销苏联内务部的命令和关于国家优抚金法律的某些修改的命令，以及其他一些法令。
    苏联最高苏维埃会议至此宣告结束。
    据新华社7日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议在6日上午结束了对赫鲁晓夫作的关于取消工人和职员的赋税的报告的讨论。会议根据杰米契夫代表的建议通过了决议，支持苏联部长会议在对内政策和对外政策方面的活动。
    6日下午，会议开始进行第二项议程：关于在1960年完成全体工人和职员向缩短的工作日过渡的措施。会议听取了苏联部长会议国家劳动和工资问题委员会主席沃尔科夫和全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申分别就这项议程作的报告。
    沃尔科夫在报告中说，到今年4月1日，苏联已经约有一千六百万劳动者过渡到七小时或六小时工作日。
    到今年年底，还将有四千三百万人过渡到七小时或六小时工作日。
    沃尔科夫列举材料，说明在缩短工作日的同时，苏联的生产水平仍在不断提高。
    沃尔科夫指出，在缩短工作日的同时，苏联职工的工资在不断提高。例如，冶金工业部门的每个工人的工资平均一年增加了一千五百卢布，化学工业部门每个职工的工资平均一年增加了一千二百卢布。
    沃尔科夫强调指出，苏维埃国家实行的旨在改善劳动人民生活的一切措施的实质，是由社会主义制度的本质决定的。他说，把很大一部分社会财富免费地提供给苏联劳动人民，这将使劳动变为人们的第一需要。
    全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申在报告中着重指出，苏联劳动人民在发展社会主义经济、大大提高劳动人民物质福利和文化水平方面获得了卓越的成就。
    沃尔科夫和格里申的报告结束以后，会议接着开始讨论他们的报告。在乌兹别克的代表发言以后，会议即告结束。
