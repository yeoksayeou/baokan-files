Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 4th: Seoul dispatch: Under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, the South Korean puppet Huh Chung and Song Yo-chan (formerly misidentified as Zan) are frantically suppressing the South Korean people engaged in patriotic and righteous struggles. A fascist atmosphere of terror still envelops South Korea.

As reported, the executioners of the South Korean "Martial Law Command," headed by the pseudo-Army Chief of Staff Song Yo-chan, killed or wounded at least five thousand people in just two days, April 19th and April 26th, using tanks, machine guns, carbines, tear gas and other weapons supplied by the United States.

In order to more brutally suppress the South Korean people, on May 2nd, the blood-debt-laden executioner Song Yo-chan again clamored at a press conference about the possibility of "fifth columnists and communists taking the opportunity to make trouble."

Huh Chung, the running dog of U.S. imperialism, known as "Syngman Rhee the Second," after climbing onto the so-called "Acting President" position, clamored on April 29th about "rampant impure communist elements" and the need to "ensure security," and so on.

The North Korean newspaper "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today, severely condemning these executioners for inheriting Syngman Rhee's mantle, engaging in "anti-communist" clamoring, and carrying out bloody suppression of the South Korean people.

The commentary said that Huh Chung, Song Yo-chan and their ilk, because they have no mask to hide their ugly faces, have picked up the already dilapidated "anti-communist" trumpet and started blowing it. However, no matter how Huh Chung and Song Yo-chan blow the "anti-communist" trumpet under the direction of U.S. imperialism, they cannot escape the same fate as Syngman Rhee.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 4th: According to a Seoul radio broadcast cited by the Korean Central News Agency, the South Korean authorities arrested another 1,163 citizens in Seoul on the evening of May 2nd under the pretext of "violating curfew."

Up to this point, in the week starting from April 26th, a total of 4,866 citizens have been arrested in Seoul. Among them, 530 have already been subjected to so-called "security interrogation."

Seoul radio said that the prisons of the city's police stations are all overcrowded.

The Korean Central News Agency pointed out that the situation in Seoul shows that the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean Huh Chung clique are hypocritically talking about "reform" on the one hand, while on the other hand implementing the same fascist suppression policies as during Syngman Rhee's rule.

    法西斯恐怖仍然笼罩着南朝鲜
    许政宋尧讚等刽子手在美国操纵下疯狂镇压爱国人民
    仅在五月二日晚上汉城就有一千多名市民被非法逮捕
    据新华社平壤4日电　汉城消息：在美帝国主义操纵下的南朝鲜傀儡许政、宋尧讚（前误为赞）正在疯狂镇压进行爱国正义斗争的南朝鲜人民。法西斯恐怖气氛仍然笼罩着南朝鲜。
    据报道，以伪陆军参谋总长宋尧讚为头目的南朝鲜“戒严司令部”的刽子手们，仅在4月19日和4月26日两天就用坦克、机关炮、卡宾枪、催泪弹等美国供应的武器杀伤了至少有五千多人。
    为了更残暴地镇压南朝鲜人民，5月2日，血债累累的刽子手宋尧讚又在记者招待会上叫嚷什么“可能有第五纵队和共产党乘机捣乱”。
    被称为“李承晚第二”的美帝国主义的走狗许政，爬上所谓“代理总统”位子以后，在4月29日就叫嚣什么“共产不纯分子跋扈”，要“确保治安”等。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论，严厉谴责这些刽子手们继承李承晚的衣钵，进行“反共”叫嚣和对南朝鲜人民的血腥镇压。
    评论说，许政、宋尧讚之流因为没有任何假面具可以遮掩他们的丑恶面目，所以拿起早已破旧了的“反共”喇叭吹起来了。但是，许政和宋尧讚在美帝国主义的指使下无论怎样吹“反共”喇叭，他们也逃不掉像李承晚一样的命运。
    新华社平壤4日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社援引汉城电台广播，南朝鲜当局5月2日晚以“破坏宵禁”为名在汉城又逮捕市民一千一百六十三人。
    至此，在从4月26日起的一星期中，在汉城市共有市民四千八百六十六人被捕。其中已有五百三十人受到所谓“治安审讯”。
    汉城电台说，市内警察局的监狱个个人满为患。
    朝鲜中央通讯社指出，汉城的情况说明，美帝国主义者和南朝鲜许政集团一面假惺惺地大谈“改革”，一面执行着同李承晚统治时一样的法西斯镇压政策。
