    Countless Words Speak of Friendship
    Du Ai
    In May, red hawthorn blossoms and purple lilac blossoms, thick and clustered, form forests and patches, filling Prague like an ocean. The streets resonate with the moving melodies of "Prague Spring," and the beautiful Vltava River reflects the golden domes of the City of a Hundred Spires. People are radiant and full of vigor.
    What great significance does the red month of May hold for the people of Czechoslovakia! A comrade named Ervin Haliř recounted a touching story: Fifteen years ago, in early May 1945, when the Soviet Red Army had already captured Berlin, Nazi bandits were still entrenched in Prague, and German radio continued to broadcast news of the German army's offensive. It was at this time that the underground radio station of the Czech people issued the solemn voice of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, calling on the people to rise up, seize weapons, set up barricades in the streets, and engage in street fighting with the German army. Immediately, the entire city, under the leadership of the Czech Communist Party, joined the uprising. Haliř's father, who was not a soldier, became an officer and worked at the Fifth Command Post, while Haliř joined the Young Guard. Later, the Nazis urgently dispatched tanks and heavily surrounded Prague. German planes bombed from the sky, and Nazi radio warned that the Czechoslovak people must lay down their arms immediately, or they would all be annihilated. But the people of Prague were not afraid and replied: "It is not the people of Prague who will be annihilated, but the brutal Nazi bandits!" At that time, the Red Army, which had advanced all the way from the Ukrainian front to Berlin, was already very exhausted. However, upon hearing the appeal from the Czech radio, they immediately departed from Berlin to Prague. On May 9th, just as the German army was deploying large-scale destruction of the city and Prague was in a state of crisis, Czech radio suddenly broadcast music, followed by the news: "The Red Army has entered Prague!" "The Nazi bandit army has surrendered!" At that time, every street was filled with Soviet tanks, and the Soviet Union also sent many doctors and transported a lot of food... The excited men and women of Prague climbed onto the tanks, warmly embraced the Red Army soldiers, and pinned flowers on their uniforms. People throughout the city came out to welcome the Red Army, and were moved to tears. Haliř said: "I will never forget this impression for the rest of my life. I will never forget the Red Army..."
    During the anti-fascist war, the blood of the Soviet Red Army flowed across the land of Czechoslovakia. In Prague, in Lidice, in Bratislava, a pearl-like city on the banks of the Danube, in Banská Bystrica, the center of the Slovak uprising, and in many other cities and villages, Red Army Martyrs' Memorials were established. Every day, many people go to these solemn memorials to pay their respects and lay flowers.
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the people of this new country, advancing vigorously in socialist construction, deeply understand that without the powerful armed forces of the revolution to crush the bloody rule of imperialism and fascism, they do not know how long the Czechoslovak proletariat would have to wait to break their chains and seize power. Therefore, the Czechoslovak people know how to defend this victory and accelerate the expansion of the achievements of socialist construction. The men, women, old, and young you come into contact with will tell you with the deepest understanding what the great meaning of the term "the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union" is. They feel from the bottom of their hearts that every guest from a fraternal country is as close as their own family. This internationalist sentiment burns within you and stirs you for a long time.
    The Czechoslovak people love China as much as they love the Soviet Union. In this country, the name of Chairman Mao has taken root in the hearts of the people, arousing boundless respect. During our visit, large posters of the translated versions of Chairman Mao's poems were posted on the streets of Prague. When we paid a visit to the Ostrava City People's Committee, the Secretary-General of the City People's Committee said: "We are very grateful for the visit of guests from the great China under the leadership of Mao Zedong. We are delighted with any achievement of the People's China. We often introduce the Great Leap Forward of China to the workers, and our factories complete Chinese orders as a top priority." Comrade Godas, the 69-year-old mayor who had been a miner for thirty years and had received many Party awards and national medals after liberation, also received us and personally presented the guests with the city emblem of a white horse on a blue background and a small storm lantern as a souvenir. The Czechoslovak people were extremely enthusiastic to the Chinese guests. Meeting them for the first time felt like meeting old friends of many years. This sense of immediate affinity made people feel that in our socialist family, the distance between acquaintances and strangers hardly needed to exist. In particular, those friends who had visited China took the greatest joy in being able to get a promise to visit their home. They would introduce their entire family to you in detail: his wife liked to wear Chinese-style short cotton jackets, his daughter hoped to be friends with Chinese children... He would take you around the living room, pointing with great interest to the paintings of Qi Baishi or Xu Beihong hanging on the wall, Hangzhou silk landscapes, and Beijing opera facial masks. The painter Anton Holy, who had been to China, even brought crickets back with him. He also told us, "You know, the crickets in Beijing chirp so enthusiastically! Listening to them chirp, my heart is filled with countless words about Beijing..."
    They liked to jokingly call those who had visited China "Chinese in Czechoslovakia." In Prague, Comrade Marschiek, the Secretary of the Secretariat of the Czechoslovak Writers' Association and Minister of International Affairs, always liked to use this affectionate term to introduce friends who had been to China to guests. One day, a female comrade from the Prague Oriental Institute came. The Minister of International Affairs pointed to her from afar and said: "Isn't that another Chinese in Czechoslovakia!" Her name was Koslova, and she was extremely affectionate. She had studied at Peking University, spoke fluent Beijing dialect, and was there to work as a translator. She introduced herself, saying that her Chinese name was He Danni.
    In an unforgettable evening in Strakonice, in passionate meetings in the Bohemian Forest, in the Pilsen region, in the "Czech-Chinese Friendship" Unified Agricultural Cooperative, in the "December" Collective Farm, in the Škoda Heavy Machinery Factory, in the world-famous Koh-i-Noor Hardtmuth pencil factory, in the automated man-made fiber factory... we met many endearing Party workers, factory directors, blacksmiths, female shock workers, engineers, border guards, farm presidents, famous writers and editors, women and children, all of whom were very lovely people. All of this is forever etched in unforgettable memories. Especially those enthusiastic and innocent Czechoslovak children, how lovable they are! When we were walking in the Tatra Mountains, suddenly a huge Škoda long-distance bus stopped in front of us, and dozens of children jumped out chattering, shouting "Long live China! Long live China!" They all gathered around, and a burst of enthusiastic applause shook the snow-covered peaks of the Tatra Mountains. An eleven-year-old child photographer took pictures for everyone and said that he would definitely send the developed photos (sure enough, a week later, they were received in Prague). Then we were very busy, because these sixth- and eighth-grade students, who had traveled from a sanatorium more than a hundred kilometers away, all took out their small notebooks, asking the guests to sign their names and to write their own names in Chinese characters, so that they could keep them as souvenirs. A thirteen-year-old girl named Trisava asked for the guests' mailing address...
    The grand festival of the 15th anniversary of Czechoslovakia's liberation has arrived, and I think of everything during my visit to this lovely socialist country. I think of the deep friendship between the Chinese and Czech people, as vast as the ocean. Thinking of this international friendship with strong class feelings, I deeply feel that even if I had a thousand or ten thousand words, I could not express it well.

    万语千言话友情
    杜埃
    5月里，红色的山楂花，紫色的丁香花，密密丛丛，成林成片，像海洋似的泛满布拉格。街头荡漾着
  “布拉格之春”的动人乐曲，美丽的伏尔塔瓦河映现出百塔之城的金顶，人们容光焕发，朝气蓬勃。
    红色的5月，对捷克斯洛伐克人民来说，具有多么重大的意义！一位叫爱尔文·哈利赫的同志讲述了这样一个动人的故事：距今十五年前，即1945年5月初，那时苏联红军已攻克了柏林，但纳粹匪徒却仍盘据着布拉格，德国广播照常播送德军进攻的消息。就在这时候，捷克人民地下电台发出了捷克斯洛伐克共产党的庄严声音，号召人民起来夺取武器，设障碍物于街头，和德军进行巷战。立即，全城的人在捷共领导下参加了起义。哈利赫的父亲本来不是军人，这时也成了军官，在第五指挥所工作，而哈利赫则参加了青年近卫军。后来纳粹急调坦克，重重包围布拉格，德机在上空轰炸，纳粹广播警告，限捷克斯洛伐克人立刻放下武器，否则全部消灭。但布拉格人毫不畏惧，回答是：“被消灭的不是布拉格人，而是凶残的纳粹匪徒！”那时红军从乌克兰战线一直攻进柏林，已经十分辛劳，但一听到捷克电台的呼吁，就立即从柏林开到布拉格来。5月9日，正当德军部署大规模破坏城市、布拉格处于千钧一发的时候，捷克电台忽然播出音乐，接着又播出了“红军攻进了布拉格！”“纳粹匪军投降了！”的消息。那时候，每一条街上都布满了苏联坦克，苏联还派来了许多医生，运来了许多粮食……。激动的布拉格男男女女就爬上坦克，热情地抱着红军，把鲜花插在红军的衣襟上，全城的人都出来欢迎红军，人们感动得流下泪来。哈利赫说：“我这一生忘不了这印象，我永远忘不了红军……。”
    在反法西斯战争中，苏联红军的鲜血流遍了捷克斯洛伐克的土地。在布拉格，在利第采，在多瑙河岸珍珠似的布拉迪斯拉伐城，在斯洛伐克起义中心邦斯卡、比斯特里查等许许多多的城市和乡村，都建立了红军烈士纪念碑，我所看到的这些庄严的纪念碑，每天都有许多人前往凭吊和献花。
    解放后，在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设中猛进的这个新国家的人民，他们深知如果没有革命的强大武装力量去粉碎帝国主义法西斯的血腥统治，捷克斯洛伐克无产阶级要解除锁链和夺得政权不知要等待到什么时候，因而捷克斯洛伐克人深知如何来保卫这个胜利的成果，并且加快速度去扩大社会主义建设的成就。你所接触到的男女老幼，他们会用最深的体会告诉你，什么是“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营”这个词儿的伟大含义。他们对来自兄弟国家的每个客人，都从心坎里感到是自己的至亲骨肉。这种国际主义的感情，使你内心燃烧，久久激动不已。
    捷克斯洛伐克人像对苏联一样热爱中国。在这个国家里，毛主席的名字已经深入人心，引起人们无限的崇敬。在我们访问的那些日子里，布拉格街头正贴出毛主席诗词翻译本出版的大幅招贴画。在俄斯特拉伐拜会市人民委员会的时候，市人委秘书长说道：“我们很感谢来自毛泽东领导下的伟大中国的客人光临参观。我们对人民中国的任何成就都很高兴。我们经常向工人介绍中国的大跃进，我们的工厂把中国订货作为头等重要的任务来完成。”做过三十年矿工、解放后得过多次党的奖励和国家奖章、现年六十九岁的老市长哥达斯同志也接见了我们，还把蓝底白马的城徽和小风雨灯亲自送给客人，作为纪念。捷克斯洛伐克人对中国客人热情极了，初次见面就好像已是多年的老朋友，这种一见如故的情谊，使人感到在我们这社会主义大家庭里，人们之间的相识和不相识的距离几乎没有存在的必要。特别是那些曾经访问过中国的友人，他们以能够得到应诺去他家作客为最大的喜悦，他会把全家人逐个向你详细介绍：他爱人喜欢穿中国式短棉袄啦，他女儿希望同中国小孩做朋友啦……。他会带着你在客厅里转来转去，兴味盎然地指着那壁上挂着的齐白石或徐悲鸿的画、杭州丝织风景、北京戏剧人物脸谱。来过中国的画家安东·荷利，竟把蝈蝈也带回去了。他又告诉我们，“你知道，北京的蝈蝈叫的多热情！听着它叫，我心中就涌荡着对北京的千言万语……。”
    他们喜欢把曾到中国访问过的人开玩笑地称为“在捷克斯洛伐克的中国人。”在布拉格，捷克斯洛伐克作家协会书记处书记兼国际部长马尔斯契克同志，总是喜欢用这亲切的词儿为客人介绍来过中国的友人。一天，来了一位布拉格东方学院的女同志，这位国际部长远远地指着她道：“那不是又来了一位在捷克斯洛伐克的中国人！”她叫柯斯洛娃，亲热极了，在北京大学念过书，说得一口流利的北京话，是来作翻译的。她自己介绍道，她的中国名字叫贺丹尼。
    在斯特拉柯尼茨难忘的夜晚，在波希米亚森林中激情的会见，在比尔森州，在“捷中友谊”统一农业合作社，在“十二月”集体农庄，在斯柯达重型机械厂，在世界有名的哥希娜路铅笔工厂，在自动化的人造纤维工厂……我们会见了许多可亲的党的工作者、厂长、锻工、女突击手、工程师、边防军人、农庄主席、著名作家和编辑、妇女和小孩，他们都是非常可爱的人，这一切都永远地保留在难忘的记忆里。尤其是那热情的、天真的捷克斯洛伐克孩子们，多使人疼爱！我们在塔特尔高山散步的时候，忽然一辆迎面驶来的巨型斯柯达牌长途客车停下了，几十个孩子叽里呱啦地跳下来，朝着我们高呼“中国万岁！中国万岁！”全都围拢前来，一阵热烈的掌声震荡着塔特尔山顶的积雪。一个十一岁的儿童摄影师为大家拍照，并表示定要把洗出的照片寄来（果然，一星期后，在布拉格收到了）。接着我们可忙啦，因为这些从一百多公里外来疗养区旅行的六年级、八年级小学生们都一个个掏出了小本子，要客人签名，还要把他们自己的名字译音用中国字写上，好留作纪念。一个名叫特丽沙娃的十三岁女孩要求客人的通讯地址……
    捷克斯洛伐克解放十五周年的盛大节日来到了，我想起了在访问这个可爱的社会主义国家时的一切。想起了中捷人民海洋似的深厚友谊。想起这种带有强烈的阶级感情的国际友谊，深感心中虽有千言万语，也不能很好地表达出来。
