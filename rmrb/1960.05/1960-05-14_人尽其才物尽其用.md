Make the Best Use of People's Talents and Resources
    Liu Feng
In the high tide of establishing people's communes in the cities, the appearance of the cities has been completely renewed: all available human and material resources have been fully mobilized to directly serve the cause of socialist construction. A large number of liberated women laborers, promoting communist style and a fearless spirit of creation, have made many unexpected miracles in running street industries. The copper refining production group of the Hongzhen Second Lane Committee of Hongkou District in Shanghai extracts copper from copper scraps. In eleven months, they extracted more than 263,900 jin of pure copper, worth 670,000 yuan; the 38 Chemical Processing Production Group of the Qingyun Road Office in Zhabei District used waste water from naphthol dye factories, conducted more than 30 experiments, and produced 230 tons of sodium sulfate in one year, saving 77 tons of mirabilite, supplying more than 80 units in the city, and supporting industrial construction. … There are many such examples!
    This new situation is by no means a simple trivial matter, and like any newly emerging thing, it has great significance and a broad future.
    Women, this is a force that has been suppressed and imprisoned for thousands of years, and all their intelligence and talents have no way to be revealed. Now, this great human resource has finally been discovered, just like the precious minerals hidden underground, becoming a new source for building socialism. This new force is adding more and more material wealth to our motherland. Engels once said: "Human society possesses extremely rich productive forces, which, if rationally organized and properly allocated, can bring the greatest benefits to everyone." Today, in our country, we have found the correct path to rationally organize productive forces, which is the people's communes in urban and rural areas. The vivid facts of women's participation in production on the industrial and agricultural fronts and the manifestation of their power fully prove the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant prediction that "Chinese women are a great human resource." "Men and women have something to do, and every household has no idlers." The great superiority of our society makes it possible for everyone to do their best for the cause of socialist construction, which is impossible under any social system.
    If people can make the best use of their talents, then things can also be used to their full potential. In fact, waste is not really waste. Waste materials can not only be used for major purposes, but also for minor purposes. If you give up what I take, you can turn useless things into useful things, give full play to the role of material resources, and also turn minor uses into major uses, and one use into multiple uses. Mobilizing women to participate in production and using waste materials for production, making "people make the best use of their talents and things make the best use of their resources," is by no means a trivial matter. Every household has no idlers, and everything is useful, which will create more and better wealth.
    "Making the best use of people's talents" and "making the best use of resources" are not unrelated. People are a decisive factor. With people, there is everything. This principle is very obvious. In social production, whether the role of things can be fully utilized and whether they can be used to their full potential mainly depends on whether people have a correct understanding of things and whether they have a correct attitude. As long as people can exert their soaring revolutionary drive, can break superstitions, liberate their minds, and fully use their intelligence, then the effectiveness of things can also be fully utilized, from useless to useful, from one use to multiple uses. Only in today's era of people's communes can we truly achieve making the best use of people's talents and making the best use of resources.

    人尽其才物尽其用 
    刘丰
    在城市大办人民公社的高潮中，城市的面貌焕然一新：一切可以利用的人力物力都被充分地调动起来直接为社会主义建设事业服务了。被解放出来的大批妇女劳动力，发扬共产主义的风格和大无畏的创造精神，就在大办街道工业中做出了许多人们意想不到的奇迹。上海虹口区虹镇第二里弄委员会淘铜加工生产组，从铜的下脚中淘出铜。十一个月淘出净铜二十六万三千九百多斤，价值六十七万元；闸北区青云路办事处三八化工加工生产组，利用染料厂乙萘粉废水，试验三十余次，一年来生产硫酸钠二百三十吨，节约芒硝七十七吨，供应全市八十多个单位，支援了工业建设。……这样的例子多得很！
    这个新情况，决不是一件简单的小事，它也和任何刚萌芽的新生事物一样，有着重大的意义和宽广的前程。
    妇女，这是几千年来一直被压抑、禁锢着的一种力量，她们的一切聪明才智没有办法显露出来。现在，这个伟大人力资源终于被发掘出来了，这就如同蕴藏在地下的宝贵矿石一样，成为建设社会主义的一个新的源泉。这支生力军正为我们祖国增加越来越多的物质财富。恩格斯曾经说过：“人类社会拥有极其丰富的生产力，只要合理地组织起来，妥善地加以调配，就可以给一切人带来最大的利益。”今天，在我们的国家里就找到了合理组织生产力的正确道路，这就是城乡的人民公社。妇女参加工农战线生产的生动事实和她们的威力的显露，也充分证明了毛泽东同志所说的：“中国的妇女是一种伟大的人力资源”这一英明预见的正确性。“男男女女有事做，家家户户无闲人”，我们这个社会的巨大优越性，就使得所有的人都可以为社会主义建设事业各尽所能，这是在任何社会制度下都不可能出现的事情。
    人能尽其材，物也就能尽其用。其实，废物也不是真废。废料不但能大材大用，小材小用，你舍我取，变无用为有用，充分发挥物力的作用，并且还能小用变大用，一用变多用。发动妇女投入生产，利用废料生产，使“人尽其才，物尽其用”，这决不是一件小事。家家无闲人，物物都有用，这就会创造出更多更好的财富。
    “人尽其才”和“物尽其用”不是没有联系的。人，是一个决定的因素。有了人，也就有了一切。这个道理是十分明显的。在社会生产中，物的作用能不能充分发挥，能不能尽其所用，主要是取决于人对物是否有正确的认识，是否有正确的态度。人们只要能够发挥冲天的革命干劲，能够破除迷信，解放思想，充分运用自己的聪明才智，那么，物的效用也就能够充分发挥，从无用到有用，从一用到多用。只有在人民公社时代的今天，才能真正做到人尽其才，物尽其用。
