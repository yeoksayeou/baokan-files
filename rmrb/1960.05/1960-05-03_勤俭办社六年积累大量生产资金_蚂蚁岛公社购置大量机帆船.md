Xinhua News Agency report: The Ant Island People's Commune in Zhoushan County, Zhejiang Province, has adhered to the policy of self-reliance and running the commune diligently and thriftily for six years. Now it has basically realized semi-mechanization and mechanization, and production has developed by leaps and bounds, changing the past poverty-stricken appearance.

Ant Island is a small island in the Zhoushan Islands, with 586 fishing households living on the two square kilometers of the island. The fishermen on this island established a large-scale fishery production cooperative as early as 1954, and formally established a people's commune in 1958. Before 1954, before the establishment of the large cooperative, there was not a single large fishing boat on the island. The members could only drive a few stakes in the near sea and cast nets to fish, unable to go to the far sea for fishing. The state had to issue relief grain and large loans to this island every year. After the establishment of the large cooperative, it adhered to the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, adding 27 large boats, and all the boats were equipped with diesel engines, which could go to the sea hundreds of nautical miles away for fishing. In nearly six years, the island's fish production has increased by 14.1 times, and the fish output value has soared by 17.4 times. This cooperative has handled the ratio of accumulation and distribution very well, accumulated a large amount of funds, purchased fishing gear, and at the same time, the living standards of all members have exceeded the living standards of wealthy fishermen in the past.

The reason why the Ant Island People's Commune has achieved such great achievements in a short period of six years is that their experience is: adhering to putting politics in command and taking the road of running the commune diligently and thriftily. In the spring of 1954, the Ant Island established a large cooperative. The Party committee of the cooperative formulated a complete plan for running the cooperative diligently and thriftily in light of the current situation, and mobilized the members to discuss it. The vast majority of members advocated running the cooperative diligently and thriftily and relying on their own efforts. The Party committee of the cooperative called on all members to work together, increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and change the face of poverty. Once the ideology was clear, there was enough drive.

The first problem encountered in developing production was the issue of funds. Because the members were "empty-handed" and investment was limited, they started by developing sideline production to solve the financial difficulties. The female members played a leading role in this issue. In just a few days, they twisted 120,000 kilograms of straw rope, sold it for more than 9,600 yuan, and bought four large boats. From then on, the fishermen of Ant Island began to have large fishing boats. In order to develop production, the members opened up avenues of production. They went to Peach Blossom, Xia Zhi, Dengbu and other islands not far from Ant Island to trawl for shrimp and fish, and also increased the number of stakes and nets around the island to catch fish. They were determined to use the income from increasing near-sea production to add fishing gear and develop far-sea production. In order to quickly change the face of poverty, all men, women, and children in the commune worked together with one heart and one mind to engage in production.

While "increasing revenue", the members paid special attention to "reducing expenditure". The masses automatically formed 24 frugal housekeeping groups, expressing that they must: "Old cloth to mend torn clothes, cloth strips to line shoe soles; save money to deposit in the cooperative, and everyone builds a new Ant Island." Many members also made long-term savings investment plans. The commune cadres were also conscientious about the commune's financial expenditures. The Party committee of the commune once proposed: compress all non-productive expenditures; money that can be spent or not spent will not be spent at all. In order to realize the mechanization of motorized junks, so that the commune could accumulate more funds in a short period of time, the members consciously proposed to improve the distribution methods. In the past, the cooperative adopted the method of "settlement per fishing season, distribution per fishing season." Because the summer and autumn fishing seasons were strong, and the two ends were relatively light, the income per fishing season was unbalanced. Later, the distribution per fishing season was changed to: "assessing the base score, paying in advance on a monthly basis, rewarding per fishing season, and distributing throughout the year", and closely grasping the gradual improvement of members' lives on the basis of continuously developing production and continuously expanding public accumulation.

The Ant Island People's Commune has adhered to the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily for six years, accumulating a large amount of funds, adding 27 motorized junks, basically realizing the mechanization of motorized junks, the output has increased sharply, and the income of the members has also increased year by year. Everyone praised the Party committee of the cooperative for these good "housekeeping methods" and said with great satisfaction: "When the river has more water, the well water also rises."

Now, the Ant Island People's Commune is not satisfied with the existing achievements, and is continuing to adhere to the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily, and vigorously carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, striving to achieve the mechanization and automation of all production (including fishing, aquaculture, processing, etc.) in the shortest possible time.

    勤俭办社六年积累大量生产资金
    蚂蚁岛公社购置大量机帆船
    据新华社讯　浙江省舟山县蚂蚁岛人民公社，六年来坚持自力更生勤俭办社的方针，现在已经基本上实现了半机械化、机械化，生产有了飞跃的发展，改变了过去贫困面貌。
    蚂蚁岛是舟山群岛中的一个小岛，在两平方公里的岛上，住着五百八十六户渔家。这个岛上的渔民，从1954年就建立了大型的渔业生产合作社，1958年正式成立了人民公社。1954年未成立大社前，全岛没有一条大渔船，社员们只能在近海打几个桩头，张网捕鱼，不能去远海捕捞。国家每年要给这个岛发放救济粮和大笔贷款。成立大社后，坚持勤俭办社的方针，添制了二十七条大船，而且船船装上了柴油机，可以到几百浬以外海面上去捕鱼。在将近六年内，该岛的鱼产量提高了十四点一倍，鱼产值猛增了十七点四倍。这个社很好地处理了积累和分配的比例，积累了大量的资金，购置了渔具，同时全体社员的生活水平已经超过过去富裕渔民的生活水平。
    蚂蚁岛人民公社所以能够在短短的六年时间取得如此巨大的成就，他们的经验是：坚持政治挂帅，走勤俭办社的道路。1954年春天，蚂蚁岛成立了大社，社党委针对当时情况制定了整套勤俭办社的计划，发动社员讨论。绝大部分的社员主张勤俭办社，自力更生。社党委号召全社社员要同心协力，开源节流，改变贫困面貌。思想通了，干劲就足了。
    在发展生产中首先遇到的就是资金问题。由于社员“底子空”，投资有限，于是他们就从发展副业生产着手解决资金困难。女社员们在这个问题上起了带头作用，她们在短短的几天中，搓出了十二万斤草绳，卖得九千六百多元，买了四条大船。从此，蚂蚁岛渔民开始有了大渔船。为了发展生产，社员们一面广开生产门路，到离蚂蚁岛不远的桃花、虾峙、登步等岛去拖虾、钓鱼，一面又在本岛周围海面上增加桩头张网捕捞。他们决心用增加近海生产的收入来添置渔具，发展远海生产。为了迅速改变贫困面貌，全社男女老少拧成一股绳，齐心合力搞生产。
    在“开源”的同时，社员们特别注意“节流”。群众自动组成了二十四个勤俭持家小组，表示一定要：“旧布补破衣，布条衬鞋底；省下钱来存社里，大家建设新蚂蚁”。许多社员还订出了长远的节约投资计划。社干部对公社的经费开支也是兢兢业业，该社党委曾提出：压缩一切非生产开支；可花可不花的钱，一律不花。为了实现机帆船化，使公社在短期间内积累更多的资金，社员们自觉地提出改进分配办法。过去这个社采取的是“汛汛结算，汛汛分配”的办法。由于夏秋汛旺，两头较淡，所以汛汛收入是不平衡的。后来把汛汛分配改为：“评定底分，按月预支，汛汛奖励，全年分配”，并且紧紧掌握了在不断发展生产、不断扩大公共积累的基础上，逐步改善社员生活。
    蚂蚁岛人民公社，坚持勤俭办社的方针六年如一日，就这样积累了大量资金，添制了二十七条机帆船，基本上实现了机帆船化，产量激增，社员收入也逐年增加。大家都称赞社党委的这些办法是好“当家谱”，并且十分满意的说：“河水多了，井水也涨了”。
    现在，蚂蚁岛人民公社并没有满足已有的成就，正在继续坚持勤俭办社的方针，大力开展技术革新、技术革命运动，为争取在最短时间内实现全部生产（包括捕捞、养殖、加工等）机械化、自动化而奋斗。（附图片）
