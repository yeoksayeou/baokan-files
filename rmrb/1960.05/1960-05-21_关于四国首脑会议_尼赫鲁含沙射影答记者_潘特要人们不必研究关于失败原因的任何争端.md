Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 19th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, who is currently visiting Cairo, prevaricated when asked by reporters on May 18th about the incident of the American spy plane violating Soviet airspace and causing the collapse of the Four-Power Summit, saying that he did not know all the facts and that this was something on which he was unwilling to express his opinion. He also said that even if he knew all the facts, he might not express his opinion.

Nehru also said that when trying to solve world problems, "getting angry won't do any good, even if such anger is justified." He said that the failure of this meeting was due to "a lack of goodwill and sincerity."

Xinhua News Agency, May 19th: According to a report by the Indian Press Trust on May 18th, when answering a question from an Indian Press Trust reporter regarding responsibility for the outcome of the Four-Power Summit, Indian Home Minister Pant avoided talking about the responsibility that the United States should bear, and he asked people "not to study any disputes regarding the causes of failure."

The news also said that well-informed sources in New Delhi "did not try to blame either side for the failure of the meeting."

    关于四国首脑会议
    尼赫鲁含沙射影答记者
    潘特要人们不必研究关于失败原因的任何争端
    新华社19日讯　开罗消息：正在开罗访问的印度总理尼赫鲁18日在记者问到关于美国间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空事件造成四国首脑会议破裂的问题时推诿说，他不知道全部事实，这是他不愿意表示意见的事。他还说，即使他知道了全部事实，他也可能不表示意见。
    尼赫鲁还说什么，在设法解决世界问题的时候，“生气是不会有什么好处的，即使这种生气是正当的”。他说这次会议的失败是由于“缺乏善意和诚意”。
    新华社19日讯　据印度报业托辣斯18日报道，印度内政部长潘特在回答印度报业托辣斯记者提出的有关四国首脑会议结果的责任问题时，回避谈到美国应负的责任，他要人们“不必研究关于失败原因的任何争端”。
    这条消息还说，新德里的消息灵通人士“没有试图把会议失败归咎于那一方。”
