    Barren Hills Transformed into Tea Mountains in Three Days
    By Li Tianrui, First Secretary of the CPC Fujian Fuding County Committee

    Three days ago, barren hills, three days later, tea mountains,
    In three to five years, gold will be loaded by the cart.

    This is a folk song from the Bailin Commune. It fully reflects the high speed of development of the Wanbao Mountains and the people's ideals and aspirations for the beautiful prospects of the mountainous area. The Bailin Commune is located on the northern foothills of Mount Taimu in northeastern Fujian and is the origin of the famous "Bailin Gongfu" tea, known at home and abroad. For many years, people only knew its name but not its reality. At the time of liberation, the entire tea garden area was only over 1,000 mu, and with the aging of the tea trees, they were eliminated year by year. The highest annual output was less than 900 dan. In the ten years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the tea garden area has more than doubled, and the total tea output has more than tripled, but the commune members always feel unsatisfied. This spring, they launched another attack on the Wanbao Mountains. In just one month, they transformed more than 40 barren hills covered with thorns and rugged rocks into 10,000 mu of new-style tea gardens. One month, 10,000 mu, exceeding the total amount accumulated by our ancestors' centuries of hard work by several times. The speed and change are so astonishing!

    Stand on Partridge Mountain and see! This great mountain, where even partridges break their wings, once took the lives of many laborers traveling at night. Today, the "Pen Holder Mountain," "Eagle Beak Mountain," and others within a radius of dozens of miles have been transformed into "spiral" tea gardens, the soil as flat as a mirror, the terraces as straight as lines, tier upon tier reaching to the sky. Every time the red sun rises in the east, the newly turned yellow soil is like millions of bolts of golden silk covering the sky and the earth. The newly planted tender green white tea seedlings are growing vigorously under the spring rain and sunshine. If this is a colorful picture, then who, with such ingenuity, embroidered the barren hills so beautifully and brilliantly in just one month? It is the more than 4,000 households of commune members in these mountains! The organization of the people's commune has given them endless divine power and the ambition and heroic spirit to open up mountains and split the earth.

    When the commune issued the order to open up the mountains, it was the twelfth lunar month of last year, and the mountains were covered with ice and snow. However, in less than two days, 2,000 people rushed in from all directions. Leading them were the Party branch secretaries of the various brigades, who brought rice, quilts, and tools, coming in a mighty force, with dozens of camps spread across the large and small mountains. Large-scale operations, what extraordinary grandeur! Red flags and slogans filled the mountains and ridges, and the sound of broadcasting and hoes shook the heavens and the earth. Facing the north wind, the commune members ate cold sweet potato rice on the mountain tops morning and evening, clearing grass and refining mountains, breaking rocks and filling valleys, and shaving off the tops of several large mountains in three or four days. Comrade Lao Yang of the commune passed by Fuding Peak in the morning. Looking up at this mountain, so steep that his knees could hit his chest, he said to himself, "It's hard to open this mountain." A commune member on the mountain replied, "What's so hard about it? With my hoe, I can flatten high mountains. Come and see tomorrow." The next day, Comrade Lao Yang passed by the mountain again and saw piles of strange rocks and firewood roots stacked aside. A new mountain stood smiling under the blue sky. The 2,000 commune members fought fiercely for several days, and then heaven made things difficult, sending three days of heavy snow, with biting cold winds and slippery mountain roads. Communist Party member Wu Qiuzhong planted a large red flag on the summit before dawn. The commune members at the foot of the mountain looked up at the red flag waving, put down their rice bowls, and ran up the mountain with rice in their mouths. Snowflakes flew, and everyone was full of energy, with slogans resounding throughout the mountain: "Cold weather, warm hearts, snow three feet deep, we won't stop work." Lan Aying, a female Communist Youth League member from the Wengjiang Brigade, swung her hoe twice and chopped off a thick firewood stump. The commune members of the entire brigade worked up a sweat, and everyone took off their cotton-padded clothes in the heavy snow. When the Spring Festival arrived, the commune Party committee mobilized everyone to go down the mountain. The commune members' hearts had long been attracted by the beautiful scenery of the barren mountains. The more they worked, the happier they became, and every day felt like New Year's Day. Who would be willing to go home and spend their days idly? After working continuously for a month, the barren mountains that had been sleeping for thousands of years changed their appearance. Huang Agong, a 76-year-old commune member from the Cheyang Brigade, went to visit a high mountain and got lost on his way back. He stood in the newly opened tea garden for a long time, then suddenly laughed loudly: "It's changed, it's changed! It's really 'seven days in the mountains, thousands of years in the world.'"

    In the past, people often reclaimed wasteland in the spring, but they could only dig a piece here and a piece there, and they couldn't accomplish great things. In the advanced cooperative, due to limitations in manpower and land, they could only open one or two mountain tops at most, and it was impossible to have a more ambitious plan. The people's commune has made the commune members truly the masters of nature. If they want mountains, they have mountains; if they want people, they have people. They think more and see further, not only for today but more for tomorrow. From the beginning, they prepared for mechanized tea mountain cultivation in the future. Now the 10,000 mu of new tea gardens are just as people describe: every mountain has ditches, every terrace has soil dams, every platform has a convenient road, and every layer has a road for vehicles. Large and small mountains are connected into a road network, and whether it is a flatbed cart, a large cart, or a small tractor and tea picking machine for mechanized farming, they can all pass along a main road through each layer of terraces to the top of the mountain. Can you imagine that this grand and detailed blueprint of the Wanbao Mountains was designed by a farmer who had just become literate? Yes, it was him. This poor peasant, Lai Jinshi, who grew up in hardship, only studied for half a year. After the Party entrusted him with the task, he patted his chest and said, "No problem! We have the general line in our hearts, and technical things, no matter how difficult, can be overcome." According to the regular method, it would take a month just to survey and design these 10,000 mu of barren hills. However, now the commune headquarters' schedule for opening up the mountains includes surveying, designing, and reclaiming the land, all in just one month. They were not defeated by time. They also did not reach out to higher authorities for levels and measuring rods... Overnight, they connected dozens of old farmers and young people and established an "Engineering Technology Research Group." Without a level, they used visual estimation and hand measurement; without a measuring rod, they used bamboo poles... In six or seven days, this ox-like strong man spent countless sleepless nights. They finally replaced foreign methods with indigenous methods, broke through the technical barriers, and opened up 10,000 mu of high-standard tea gardens. What ambitious and energetic people! The Party's call and the far-reaching prospects have brought out endless wisdom and strength in their hearts. How noble and glorious their spiritual world is!

    Recently, the commune Party committee calculated an account: in three years, the 10,000 mu of tea gardens will produce 10,000 dan of tea, worth 1.2 million yuan; in five years, with mechanized farming, the output can be increased by 20,000 dan, worth 2 million yuan, and the average income per household can be increased by more than 500 yuan. Everyone smiled with joy after hearing this calculation. Encouraged by this beautiful prospect, in addition to planting white tea in the newly opened tea gardens, the commune members are also building bases for 10,000 pigs, 10,000 rabbits, and 10,000 chickens. The livestock farms, which are beginning to take shape, will soon begin to automatically send fertilizer to the tea mountains. Many fruit farmers are also busy pruning persimmon seedlings and pear seedlings... In a few years, the mountains within a radius of dozens of miles will be filled with white tea flowers and pear blossoms, and orange-red persimmons, a riot of color, with spring every year and every season, more beautiful than any garden. The commune's 1,500-kilowatt hydroelectric power station, which is about to be completed, is preparing to send electricity to the various pavilions on the tea mountains. Later, during the peak tea picking season, thousands of bright electric lights will be reflected in the green tea bushes, tractors and tea picking machines will roar across the mountains, and the commune members' songs and laughter will merge into one... That happy and beautiful scene will bloom like countless鲜艳 flowers everywhere under the Party's sunshine!

    荒山三日变茶山
    中共福建福鼎县委第一书记　李天瑞
    三日前是荒山，三日后是茶山，
    再过三五年，黄金用车装。
    这是白琳公社的一首民歌。它充分反映了开发万宝山的高速度，和人们对山区美好前景的理想和渴望。白琳公社位于闽东北太姥山的北麓，是古今闻名国内外的“白琳工夫”茶的产地。多少年来，人们只知其名而不知其实。解放时，它全部的茶园面积只有一千多亩，加上茶龄衰老，年年淘汰，最高年产量不上九百担。解放十年来，在党的领导下，茶园面积扩大了两倍多，茶叶总产量翻了三番多，但是社员们总感到不满足。今年春天，又向万宝山发起了进军，只一个月的时间，就把四十多座荆棘丛生、岩石峥嶙的荒山，变成了万亩新式茶园。一个月，一万亩，它超过了我们祖先千百年来血汗经营的总数的好几倍。其速度和变化是何等惊人啊！
    你站在鹧鸪山看吧！这个鹧鸪都飞折翅膀的大山，当年曾经断送过多少赶夜路的劳动人民的生命？如今方圆数十里内的“笔架山”、“鹰嘴山”……都开成了“螺旋式”的茶园，土平如镜，坎直如线，一坪坪直叠上天。每当红日东升，新翻起的黄土，像铺天盖地的罩下千万匹金色的绸缎。新栽下的嫩绿的白茶苗，在春雨、阳光下滋滋地生长。假如说，这是一幅彩图的话，那么，为时只有一个月，是谁巧夺天工，绣得荒山如此美丽辉煌呢？是这山里四千多户社员！人民公社的组织，赋给了他们无穷无尽的神力，给了他们开山劈地的雄心和豪迈的气魄。
    公社发出开山令的时候，正值去年腊月，冰雪封山，可是不到两天内，四处就赶来了两千人马。领头的是各个大队的党支书，他们带米、带被、带工具，浩浩荡荡地来了，大大小小的山头上连营数十里。大兵团作战，好非凡的气派呵、满山满岗红旗、标语万千，广播声，锄声震天动地。社员们迎着北风，早晚在山头上吃着冰冷的地瓜米，劈草炼山，破石填谷，三、四天内就剃光了几座大山头。公社的老杨同志上午路过复鐤峰，昂头望见这膝可撞胸的大山，自言自语道：“开这山可是难呵。”山上社员接嘴道：“难什么？看我这把锄头，高山能踩成平地，明天你再来看吧。”次日老杨同志过山来，只见千百堆怪石、柴根堆在一旁，一座新山迎笑屹立在蓝天下。两千社员酣战了数日，老天爷还来作难，连下了三天大雪，寒风刺骨，山道滑溜。共产党员吴秋忠，天曚曚 亮就把大红旗插上顶峰。山下社员昂头看红旗招展，放下饭碗嘴里边嚼着饭边跑上山。雪花纷纷飞，人人劲冲天，满山响起口号：“天寒心头热，雪下三尺不停工。”翁江大队女共青团员兰阿英，两锄头就甩掉碗口粗的大柴头。全队社员干得浑身大汗，大雪天里个个脱下了棉衣。春节到了，公社党委会动员大家下山。社员们的心早已被荒山的美景吸引住了，他们越干越高兴，日日像过年，谁还愿意回家闲着空过日子呢？连续干了一个月，沉睡了几千年的荒山，换了模样。俥阳大队七十六岁的老社员黄阿恭去高山里做客，回来时竟迷路了。他在新开的茶园中楞了半天，忽然哈哈大笑：“变了变了，真是‘山中方七日，世上几千年’”。
    这里过去春天时，也常有人开荒，但是只能东挖一块，西挖一块，办不了大事。高级社时，由于人力、土地等条件限制，最多也只能开一个两个山头，不可能有更远大的规划。人民公社，使社员们真正作了大自然的主人，要山有山、要人有人，他们想得更多，看得更远，不仅为今天想，更多的是为明天想，一开始时就为今后茶山机械耕作做了准备。现在万亩的新茶园，正像人们描绘的：山山开沟渠，坎坎筑土坝，坪坪有便道，层层通车子。大山小山连成了道路网，不论板车、大车以及实行机耕时的小型拖拉机和采茶机，都可沿着一条大道通过每一层梯园绕到山顶。这幅宏大精细的万宝山蓝图，你能想像得到是出自一个刚脱盲的农民之手设计的吗？是的，就是他。这个从小就在苦水里浸大的贫农赖金石，只念过半年的“人之初”。党把任务交给他后，他拍拍胸膛说：“没问题！我们心里有了总路线，技术之类的东西，再难也治得了它。”按照正规的办法，这万亩荒山单勘察设计就要一个月的时间，然而现在公社指挥部的开山日程上，连勘察、设计和开荒加起来才有一个月。他们没有被时间难倒。也没有伸手向上级要水平仪、测量杆……，一夜间就串连了几十个老农和青年，成立起了“工程技术研究组”，没水平仪用目测、手测；没测量杆用竹竿……，六、七天中，这个牛牯似的大汉，熬过了多少个不眠之夜呵，他们终于用土法代替了洋法，闯过了技术关，开出了万亩高标准的茶园。这是一种多么有雄心有气魄的人，党的号召、远大前景，在他们心灵中引出了无穷无尽的智慧和力量，他们的精神世界是何等高尚和光彩呵！
    最近公社党委会算了一笔账：三年后万亩茶园产茶万担，价值一百二十万元，五年后用机器耕作，可增产两万担，价值两百万元，平均每户能增加收入五百多元。这笔账算得人人喜笑颜开。在这个美好的前景鼓舞下，现在社员们除了在新开的茶园里栽下白茶外，还正在建设万头猪、万头兔、万头鸡等基地。初具规模的畜牧场，就要开始向茶山自动送肥了。许多果农也正忙着剪柿苗、梨苗……。几年后，方圆几十里的山头上，白的茶花、梨花、红橙橙的柿子，万紫千红，年年季季是春天，再美的花园也比不过它。即将建成的公社一千五百瓩水电站，正准备向茶山上各个凉亭送电。以后春茶旺采时，青绿的茶丛中映照着千百盏白花花的电灯，拖拉机和采茶机满山轰鸣，社员们的歌声和笑声汇成一片，……那幅欢乐的美景，就要像无数鲜艳的花朵一样，在党的阳光下遍地盛开！
