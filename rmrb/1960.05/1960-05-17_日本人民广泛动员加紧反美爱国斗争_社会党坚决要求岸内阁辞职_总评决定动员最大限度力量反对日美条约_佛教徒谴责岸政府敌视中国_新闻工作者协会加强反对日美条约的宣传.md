Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Tokyo dispatch: The leaders' meeting of local organizations of the Japanese Socialist Party passed a resolution on the 15th, resolutely demanding the dissolution of the Diet and the resignation of the most reactionary Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet in postwar Japan.

    The resolution pointed out that the Japanese people have recognized the danger of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," which will involve Japan in war.

    The resolution strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke group's conspiracy to force the Diet to approve the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and pointed out that this is trampling on the rights of the people and the Diet.

    The resolution demands the immediate dissolution of the Diet and the holding of a general election to elect a new House of Representatives. The resolution pointed out: "On the question of whether to approve the Security Treaty, the people are the highest judges."

    In the resolution, the Socialist Party expressed its firm opposition to the ruling party's extension of the Diet session, which should end on May 26, for the purpose of approving the new "Security Treaty."

    The resolution also revealed that the Kishi Nobusuke group's attempt to extend the Diet session was to please its American masters. The resolution said that this was done to ensure that the Diet's deliberations would not hinder U.S. President Eisenhower's planned visit to Japan from June 19 to 23.

    The Socialist Party also decided to submit this resolution to the Diet.

    Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Tokyo dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, with 3.6 million members, held a meeting today and decided to further strengthen the struggle against the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    The meeting decided that from May 17 to 19, the General Council of Trade Unions will mobilize 5,000 people every day to petition the Diet, and on the 20th, strikes and rallies will be held throughout the country to oppose the Diet's ratification of the treaty. A demonstration will also be held in Tokyo that day. After the 21st, the trade union will continue to petition the Diet every day.

    The meeting also decided that in order to prevent the Kishi Nobusuke group from extending the Diet session and suspending deliberations on the new "Security Treaty," the General Council of Trade Unions will mobilize its maximum force to carry out a resolute struggle.

    In addition, the Japan "Joint Struggle Conference of Kyushu Region to Stop the Ratification of the Security Treaty" decided yesterday that workers in Kyushu will hold a conference in the workshops on the 20th to oppose the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

    The Joint Struggle Conference also decided that when the ruling and opposition parties hold a public opinion hearing on the new "Security Treaty" in Fukuoka City tomorrow, it will mobilize about 10,000 trade union members, students, cultural figures, etc. to hold a petition movement in front of the Fukuoka Prefectural Government to stop the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," and at the end of the public opinion hearing, hold a Kyushu region general mobilization meeting in front of the prefectural government to stop the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and support the struggle of the Miike Coal Mine workers.

    Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japan Federation of Journalists Unions decided that the association's organ "Journalist" will publish a supplement every two days during the movement against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," specifically carrying news about the struggle against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," in order to strengthen propaganda about the opposition to the new "Security Treaty."

    The first supplement has already been published today, which contains news about the petition to the Diet on the 14th and the situation within the Conservative Party. Yoko Matsuoka published in this issue a report on her testimony at the public hearing held in the Diet on the new "Security Treaty" issue.

    Reporters and editors working in newspapers, news agencies, radio stations, and publishing companies who are at the forefront of the struggle are participating in the publication of the supplement.

    Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japan Association for the Protection of Children held its eighth congress in Tokyo on the 14th, and unanimously decided to participate in the struggle against the Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty." The congress then immediately elected representatives to participate in the petition to the Diet that day.

    The Japan Association for the Protection of Children is composed of 98 mass organizations, 59 regional organizations, and more than 200 social activists. For eight years, it has been waging unremitting struggles to seek the happiness of children.

    The congress also unanimously agreed that it is necessary to strive for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs. In order to achieve the above goals, the congress decided to amend the articles of association.

    At the initiative of the Japan Association for the Protection of Children, Japan launched the second Children's Month activity from May 5, which will continue until June 1. A grand gathering to celebrate International Children's Day will be held on May 28.

    Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Tokyo dispatch: Many famous Buddhists in Japan submitted petitions to the Diet, opposing the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." On May 13, the Kyoto Buddhist Conference submitted a petition to the Diet. The petition was signed by Yushin Hosoi, the abbot of Ryūhon-ji Temple, Ryokei Onishi, the abbot of Kiyomizu-dera Temple, Toshio Miyagi, the abbot of Byōdō-in Temple, and 92 other monks, all of whom belong to very famous temples in Kyoto. The petition emphasized that the signatories opposed the revision of the "Security Treaty" from a Buddhist point of view. The petitioners said, "The new 'Security Treaty' will make Japan forever hostile to China. We declare that we cannot tolerate Japan continuing to adopt a hostile attitude towards China, because Japan has committed a serious crime of aggression against China. We condemn the new treaty, considering it a violation of humanitarianism and Buddhism."

    Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Tokyo dispatch: The "Japan Diet Members League for Promoting Japan-China Trade" issued a statement today, calling on Liberal Democratic Party members not to help Kishi Nobusuke forcibly approve the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and to strive for the normalization of Japan-China relations.

    The statement pointed out that the present is a critical period for determining the fate of the Japanese nation. The statement emphasized the importance of breaking the deadlock in Japan-China relations. The statement said that a series of recent events have shown that the fallacy of breaking the deadlock in Japan-China relations after the revision of the "Security Treaty" is unworkable.

    The statement emphasized that if the Liberal Democratic Party members truly care about the future of Japan, they should stop assisting Kishi Nobusuke's conspiracy to forcibly approve the new "Security Treaty" and strive for the normalization of Japan-China relations.
