    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th Dispatch: The Kishi Nobusuke clique brazenly used police violence at midnight today, driving out opposition party members and manipulating the Diet's House of Representatives to unilaterally pass the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.
    Before the House of Representatives plenary session convened, Speaker Ichiro Kiyose called five hundred police officers into the Diet, forcibly expelling Socialist Party members. Socialist Party members had been struggling in the Diet all day today, opposing the extension of the Diet session and opposing the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."
    Then, Ichiro Kiyose convened a so-called House of Representatives plenary session attended only by members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The Liberal Democratic Party took this opportunity to first unilaterally pass a resolution to extend the Diet session by fifty days. Subsequently, Ozawa (a Liberal Democrat), chairman of the House of Representatives "Security Treaty" Special Committee, hastily made a report on the review of the new "Security Treaty."
    Without any discussion, the treaty, which is resolutely opposed by the Japanese people and the people of the world, was "passed" in the absence of all but Liberal Democratic Party members.
    Today, tens of thousands of people held demonstrations outside the Diet in the rain. They shouted: "The Korean people overthrew Syngman Rhee, we will overthrow Kishi Nobusuke!" The Japanese people have long declared that even if the Diet approves the new "Security Treaty," the people will never recognize this aggressive and nation-betraying dirty treaty.

    岸信介集团用暴力赶走在野党议员  
    强行通过日美军事同盟条约
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：岸信介集团今天午夜悍然施用警察暴力，赶走在野党议员，操纵国会众议院单独通过了侵略性的日美军事同盟条约。
    在众议院召开全体会议之前，议长清濑一郎把五百名警察叫进国会，用暴力将社会党议员强行赶走。社会党议员今天整天都在议会中进行斗争，反对延长国会会期和反对批准新“安全条约”。
    然后，清濑一郎召集了只有执政的自由民主党的议员参加的所谓众议院全体会议。自由民主党利用这个机会首先单独通过了延长国会会期五十天的决议案。随后，众议院“安全条约”特别委员会委员长小泽（自由民主党人）匆忙在会上作了关于审议新“安全条约”情况的报告。
    会议没有进行任何讨论，就在只有自由民主党议员在场的情况下，“通过”了这个遭到日本人民和全世界人民坚决反对的军事侵略条约。
    今天，在国会外面成千上万的人民冒雨举行示威。他们高呼：“朝鲜人民推翻了李承晚，我们将推翻岸信介！”日本人民早已宣布，即使国会批准新“安全条约”，人民也决不承认这个侵略性的和出卖民族利益的肮脏条约。
