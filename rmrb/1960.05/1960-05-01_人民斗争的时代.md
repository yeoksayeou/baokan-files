　　Today, the Chinese people, men and women, young and old, from the people's communes in cities and villages, from factories, mines, fields, schools, government offices, and canteens, are taking to the streets in tens of thousands to celebrate "May Day" International Labor Day. And just three days ago, in Beijing alone, 600,000 people took to the streets, gathering in Tiananmen Square to express their fighting will against U.S. imperialism.

　　The people who are waging a heroic struggle against the most vicious enemy of the people of the world—U.S. imperialism—to win their independence and liberation will never be isolated. The 650 million Chinese people are determined to support them with action. All the oppressed and exploited people in the world, all the laborers who have already gained liberation, also firmly stand with the Korean people. The people of Cuba and other Latin American countries are struggling, the people of Algeria and other African countries are struggling, the people of Japan and other Asian countries are also struggling, and the people of the whole world are fighting against the imperialist colonialists, especially the most brutal U.S. imperialists. These facts illustrate that our era is an era of people's struggle, an era of mutual support among peoples of all countries against a common enemy.

　　Humanity must progress, the world must progress. The oppressed and exploited people have reached the limit of their endurance and have recognized their enemies. In order to progress, they must liberate themselves; in order to liberate themselves, they must fight to the death with their mortal enemies. Thus, struggles rise one after another, surging across the world. No amount of cruel suppression, no sweet talk urging them not to struggle, or advising against struggle, can stop this great trend of the great era.

　　A few days ago, commemorating Lenin, we reviewed his exposition on the revolutionary struggle of the world's people in the age of imperialism. Judging from the facts of the struggle of the people of South Korea and other countries today, we are even more convinced of the theory that Lenin taught us. Judging from Lenin's theory, we are even more convinced that the people's struggle will surely achieve victory, and the rule of imperialism will inevitably collapse.

　　Lenin said: Capitalism has become so corrupt and moribund in the age of imperialism that it is nearing its death. Not only has U.S. imperialism itself entered a parasitic, corrupt, and dying stage, but the forces it has cultivated and supported are also completely rotten and dying things. No healthy person with even a little "humanity" is willing to serve U.S. imperialism. All it can find and rely on are rotten dregs like Chiang Kai-shek, Ngo Dinh Diem, and Syngman Rhee. But these puppet regimes cannot even maintain their own seats and are tottering. How can they stop the torrent of people's struggle? Socialism and communism are bound to achieve final victory, and the oppressed and enslaved people are bound to gain freedom and liberation. Imperialism is bound to perish. This is an inevitable law of history, which does not depend on human will. The people of South Korea and the people of all colonial and semi-colonial countries who are engaged in struggle clearly see that what must be overthrown and overthrown is not only those puppet regimes, but also their backer, U.S. imperialism.

　　The struggle of the South Korean people shows that all reactionary rule is not terrible, and imperialism is not terrible. "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" and "clay giants." Imperialism is already extremely corrupt, and the puppet forces it has cultivated are even more rotten like mud. At the same time, it also shows that the people can only defeat the enemy by carrying out struggle and only by adopting violence to deal with imperialism and reactionary rule.

　　The root of all evils, oppression, poverty, carnage, and war is imperialism. Today, this is mainly U.S. imperialism. There can be no peace in the world, and the people can only be independent and free if U.S. imperialism is overthrown. There can be no peace or benevolence with imperialism. "If they are defeated, it can only be attributed to their 'leniency'" (Marx). The Chinese people, who have won victory in the struggle against imperialism, completely stand on the side of all oppressed people in the world, are determined to support their struggle, and are willing to tell them our own struggle experience: Imperialism must be fought to the end, and there must be no "leniency"! Struggle will surely achieve victory, because now is the era in which the people's struggle achieves victory.

    人民斗争的时代
    林陵
    今天，中国人民，男女老少，从城市和农村的人民公社，从工厂、矿山、田头、学校、机关、食堂里成千成万地走到街上去，庆祝“五一”国际劳动节。而在三天前单是在北京，就有六十万人走到街上去，聚集在天安门广场上，表示了反对美帝国主义的斗争意志。
    为反对全世界人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义，为争取自己的独立解放而进行英勇斗争的人民决不会孤立，六亿五千万的中国人民用行动表示决心支援，全世界一切被压迫被剥削的人，一切已经取得解放的劳动者，也都坚决地站在朝鲜人民方面。古巴和拉丁美洲的其他各国人民在斗争，阿尔及利亚和非洲其他各国的人民在斗争，日本和亚洲其他各国的人民也在斗争，全世界的人民都在对帝国主义殖民者，特别是对最凶残的美帝国主义者进行着斗争。这些事实说明了我们的时代，是人民斗争的时代，是各国人民互相支援反对共同敌人的时代。
    人类必须进步，世界必须进步。被压迫被剥削的人民已经忍无可忍，已经认清了自己的敌人，为了进步，必须解放自己，为了解放自己，必须同自己的死敌拼死搏斗。于是此起彼伏的斗争，汹涌于全世界，任何残酷镇压，不许斗争或不要斗争的花言巧语的劝说，都不能阻挡这个大时代的大潮流。
    前几天纪念列宁，我们温习了他的关于帝国主义时代世界人民革命斗争的阐述，从今天南朝鲜和其他国家人民的斗争事实来看，更加确信列宁教导我们的理论，从列宁的理论来看，更加确信人民的斗争必然取得胜利，帝国主义的统治必然崩溃。
    列宁说：资本主义发展到帝国主义时代已腐朽不堪，临近死亡。美帝国主义者非但本身进入寄生、腐朽、垂死的阶段，它所培植和扶持的力量也完全是腐烂、败死的东西。没有一个健康的、有些微“人性”的人肯为美帝国主义服务，它所能找到，所能依靠的只是像蒋介石、吴庭艳、李承晚这种腐烂的败类。可是这些傀儡政权，连自己的座位都保持不住，摇摇欲坠，它们又怎能挡得住人民斗争的洪流？社会主义、共产主义一定得到最后胜利，被压迫、被奴役的人民，一定得到自由和解放，帝国主义一定灭亡，这是历史的必然规律，不以人的意志为转移的。正在进行斗争的南朝鲜人民和一切殖民地半殖民地国家的人民，都清楚地看到：要打倒、要推翻的，不仅是那些傀儡政权，而是它们的后台美帝国主义。
    南朝鲜人民的斗争，既显示了一切反动统治不可怕，帝国主义不可怕，“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”，都是“泥塑巨人”，帝国主义已经腐朽不堪，它所培植的傀儡势力更为腐烂如泥，同时也显示了人民只有进行斗争，对付帝国主义和反动统治只有采取暴力，才能摧枯拉朽地打倒敌人。
    一切罪恶、压迫、穷困、残杀、战争的根源是帝国主义。在今天来说，主要是美帝国主义。必须打倒美帝国主义，世界才有和平，人民才能独立自由。对帝国主义不能讲和平，不能讲仁慈，“如果他们被战败了，那只能归咎于他们的‘宽大’”（马克思）。对帝国主义斗争取得胜利的中国人民，完全站在世界上一切被压迫人民方面，决心支持他们的斗争，并且愿以自己的斗争经验告诉他们：对帝国主义必须斗争到底，决不能“宽大”！斗争必能取得胜利，因为现在是人民斗争取得胜利的时代。
