Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 30th—News: Leaders of the Japan Socialist Party and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) held talks this afternoon to discuss a joint plan of action to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and force the dissolution of the Diet.

The leaders of these two organizations decided to hold a rally in Tokyo around June 10th, with 250,000 workers, students, and people from other sectors participating, to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The talks were held by Secretary-General Eda Saburo of the Socialist Party and Secretary-General Iwai Akira of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan at the Sohyo headquarters.

They unanimously agreed that, in order to promote the struggle to overthrow the Kishi Cabinet and dissolve the Diet, the Socialist Party will convene a special delegate conference on June 6th; the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan will hold a two-day national delegate conference in Tokyo starting on June 8th.

At the conference, the Socialist Party will determine effective measures, including the resignation of all Diet members, to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," force the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet to resign, and dissolve the House of Representatives.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan will formulate a policy to promote the anti-Kishi and anti-U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" movement at the conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 30th—News: The Japan Socialist Party held an emergency meeting of leading cadres yesterday, deciding to use mass pressure to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government and force the dissolution of the Diet.

The leading cadres of the Socialist Party studied the future struggle policy at this meeting.

The meeting believed that the Kishi Nobusuke government is attempting to "pass" the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" unilaterally in the House of Councillors before June 18th. In order to prevent this conspiracy from succeeding, it is better to mobilize the masses than to engage in Diet struggles.

The meeting pointed out that, according to reports from all over the country, the demand for the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet to step down and dissolve the Diet has risen throughout the country.

The Socialist Party decided to fully support the 17th national unified action to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," centered on the general strike on June 4th, and to develop this unified action into a powerful struggle.

The meeting also decided that the Socialist Party will conduct speaking tours across the country before June 10th, calling on the people of all regions to rise up and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and force the dissolution of the Diet.

The Socialist Party decided to closely monitor the Kishi Nobusuke group's conspiracy to unilaterally vote on the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Councillors.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 30th—News: Increasingly broad sectors of Japanese society have voiced calls for Kishi Nobusuke to step down and dissolve the Diet.

More than 130 representatives from the "Grass Seeds Society," composed of housewives, brought their children to the Diet today to petition, expressing opposition to the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and demanding the collective resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

They also sent ten representatives to meet with Chief Cabinet Secretary Shiina Etsusaburo of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, submitting a protest letter to him protesting the Kishi Nobusuke group's act of bringing police into the Diet to forcibly vote on the new "Security Treaty," and demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet immediately resign collectively.

They strongly protested Kishi Nobusuke's open slander of those participating in demonstrations demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet as "just a part of the masses who were transferred here."

The representatives pointed out that ordinary housewives like us are also outraged by Kishi Nobusuke's atrocities.

Subsequently, the women representatives of the "Grass Seeds Society" visited various newspaper offices, news agencies, and radio stations, and submitted requests, demanding that the news organizations correctly report various facts from the standpoint of the people and strive to uphold democracy.

The Japan Historical Science Society adopted a resolution at its conference held in Tokyo on the 28th, demanding the collective resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the immediate dissolution of the Diet. The resolution stated that it does not recognize the "vote" of the House of Representatives on the new "Security Treaty."

The resolution pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's act of forcing the House of Representatives to "pass" the new "Security Treaty" is the same as Eisenhower's robber-like attitude in the U-2 spy plane incident that violated Soviet airspace, and is a struggle of the war forces trapped in the face of world peace forces.

The resolution said that, just as people in various parts of China held large-scale demonstrations against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, opposition to the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is surging not only in Japan but also abroad. Sixty-eight professors and associate professors who are participating in the 11th conference of the Kansai Sociological Society at Kobe University jointly issued a statement on the 29th, protesting the Kishi Nobusuke government's atrocities in the Diet and demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet.

The Osaka Prefecture Democratic Medical Groups Federation decided at a recent emergency meeting to hold a "strike" as part of the workers' general strike on June 4th.

The thirty-three clinics and hospitals belonging to this federation will stop working on that day and issue a statement demanding Kishi Nobusuke's resignation, the dissolution of the Diet, and opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

The federation also decided, at the request of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, to continue sending medical rescue teams to the Miike coal mine to support the workers' struggle against mass layoffs.

The "All-Japan Private University Student Federation," composed of students from private universities, held its spring conference on the 29th and unanimously passed a resolution expressing its intention to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," demanding the collective resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

In Nagasaki, the fishermen's union, which has 1,100 members, decided on May 27th that all fishermen who are currently fishing at sea should send telegrams to Kishi Nobusuke demanding his resignation and the dissolution of the Diet.

The Itami Democratic Merchants and Entrepreneurs Federation, composed of 150 merchants, decided at its conference held on May 26th that their shops will be closed on June 4th. June 4th is the day that Japanese workers are scheduled to hold a general strike to oppose the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and demand the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

On May 21st, more than 20,000 representatives from all over Japan, joined by workers and students from Tokyo, demonstrated in front of Kishi Nobusuke's residence, holding up signs that read "U.S. troops get out of Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan!"

    新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本社会党和日本工会总评议会的领导人今天下午举行会谈，商定共同推翻岸信介内阁和迫使解散国会的斗争计划。
    这两个组织的领袖决定，在6月10日前后，要在东京举行共有二十五万工人、学生和其他阶层人士参加的大会，反对日美军事同盟条约。
    这次会谈是由社会党书记长江田三郎和日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章在总评议会总部举行的。
    他们一致同意，为了推进打倒岸内阁和解散国会的斗争，社会党将在6月6日召开特别代表大会；总评议会将从6月8日起在东京举行两天的全国代表大会。
    在大会上，社会党将确定包括全体国会议员辞职等有效的措施，来阻止国会批准新日美“安全条约”，迫使岸信介内阁辞职和解散众议院。
    总评议会在大会上将制定推进反岸和反对日美“安全条约”运动的方针。
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本社会党昨天举行领导干部紧急会议，决定要用群众的压力，打倒岸信介政府和迫使解散国会。
    社会党领导干部在这次会议上研究了今后的斗争方针。
    会议认为，岸信介政府正在企图于6月18日以前在参议院单独“通过”新日美“安全条约”。为了阻止这种阴谋得逞，与其进行国会斗争，不如发动群众。
    会议指出，根据来自全国各地的报告，要求岸信介内阁下台和解散国会的呼声已经在全国范围内高涨起来。
    社会党决定要全力支持以6月4日总罢工为中心的第十七次阻止批准新“安全条约”全国统一行动，使这次统一行动发展成为强有力的斗争。
    会议并且决定，社会党将在6月10日以前，在全国各地进行演说旅行，呼吁各地人民起来打倒岸信介内阁和迫使解散国会。
    社会党决定，要严密监视岸信介集团企图在参议院单独表决新“安全条约”的阴谋活动。
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本越来越广泛的阶层发出了要求岸信介下台和解散国会的呼声。
    由家庭妇女组成的“草种子会”的代表一百三十多人，今天抱着小孩到国会请愿，表示反对批准新“安全条约”，要求岸信介内阁全体辞职和解散国会。
    她们还派遣十名代表会见岸信介内阁的官房长官椎名悦三郎，向他递交一份抗议书，抗议岸信介集团把警察引进国会强行表决新“安全条约”的暴行，并且要求岸信介内阁立即全体辞职。
    她们强烈抗议岸信介公开诬蔑参加示威游行要求岸信介内阁下台和解散国会的“不过是被调来的一部分群众”。
    代表们指出，像我们这样普通的家庭妇女也对岸信介的暴行感到气愤。
    随后“草种子会”的妇女代表们访问各家报馆、通讯社和广播电台，并递交要求书，要求各新闻机构站在人民的立场正确报道各种事实，并且为维护民主而努力。
    日本历史学研究会28日在东京召开的大会上，通过了要求岸信介内阁全体辞职和立即解散国会的决议。决议表示不承认众议院关于新“安全条约”的“表决”。
    决议指出，岸信介强使众议院“通过”新“安全条约”的暴行，同艾森豪威尔在U—2型间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空事件上所表现的强盗态度一样，是在世界和平力量面前陷入困境的战争势力的挣扎。
    这项决议说，正如中国各地人民举行大示威反对日美军事同盟那样，反对新日美“安全条约”的声浪不仅在日本国内而且在国外掀起。正在神户大学参加关西社会学会第十一次会议的六十八位教授和副教授，29日联合发表声明，抗议岸信介政府在国会的暴行，并且要求立即解散国会。
