Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch: Japanese bourgeois newspapers have expressed dissatisfaction with the Kishi Nobusuke clique's outrageous attempt to force the Diet to pass the new "Security Treaty."

    The "Mainichi Shimbun" criticized in today's editorial the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling party for trying to force the new "Security Treaty" through the Diet in a very short period of time in order to cooperate with the US Congress's ratification of the treaty. The newspaper said that this measure would throw the Diet into chaos and trample on parliamentarianism. The "Mainichi Shimbun" demanded that Kishi Nobusuke dissolve the Diet. An editorial in the "Yomiuri Shimbun" said that forcing the House of Representatives to pass the new "Security Treaty" after suspending deliberations midway would be a tragedy for the Japanese people. The "Asahi Shimbun" demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government study the doubts and improprieties of the Japanese public regarding the new "Security Treaty" and renegotiate with the United States.

    岸信介集团企图强行通过日美条约
    日本资产阶级报纸也表示不满
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本资产阶级报纸对岸信介集团企图强使国会通过新“安全条约”的横暴做法表示不满。
    “每日新闻”在今天的社论中指责岸信介政府和执政党为了配合美国国会批准这项条约，要在很短时间内强行在国会通过新“安全条约”。这家报纸说，这种措施将使国会陷入混乱，并且蹂躏议会主义。“每日新闻”要求岸信介解散国会。“读卖新闻”的社论说，在中途停止审议的情况下强使众议院通过新“安全条约”，这对于日本人民将是一个悲剧。“朝日新闻”要求岸信介政府对日本公众对新“安全条约”的怀疑和不妥当的地方进行研究，重新同美国进行谈判。
