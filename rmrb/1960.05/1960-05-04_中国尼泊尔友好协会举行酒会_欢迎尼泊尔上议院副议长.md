The China-Nepal Friendship Association held a reception this evening to welcome Mrs. Kamal Rana, Vice-Chairman of the Nepalese Upper House and Captain of the Nepalese Table Tennis Team, and other members of the Nepalese Table Tennis Team who were invited to visit our country.

Zhou Shujia said that the recent friendly visits between the Prime Ministers of Nepal and China and the signing of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship, the Boundary Agreement, and the Economic Assistance Agreement between the two governments have advanced the friendly relations between the two countries to a new stage. This fully proves that the friendly relations between the two countries, like the Himalayas, stand tall and cannot be shaken by any external force.

The recently signed Treaty of Peace and Friendship between China and Nepal is a vivid example of the growing friendship between the two countries.
