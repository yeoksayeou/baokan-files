Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 18th: Japanese government's Construction Ministry Geographical Survey Institute member, Kimishima Takeo, revealed in the recently published "Chuo Koron" weekly magazine that, since 1957, the aeronautical maps of areas including China and Soviet Siberia compiled by the Geographical Survey Institute and submitted to the "Defense Agency" have all been compiled and drawn based on photographs taken by U.S. Army Far East Map Service using U-2 aircraft.

At a recent meeting of the House of Representatives Special Committee on the "Security Treaty," Socialist Party members pointed out the aggressive intentions of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" and demanded that the government disclose the source of this map material.

At the time, "Defense Agency" Director-General Munenori Akagi replied that the map was compiled using maps provided by international private aviation organizations as material. Kimishima Takeo pointed out in "Chuo Koron" magazine that Akagi Munenori's reply was a deceitful lie.

Kimishima went on to reveal that, from 1957, the Geographical Survey Institute was also commissioned by the "Self-Defense Forces" to compile "detailed security maps" including the entirety of Japan, the Soviet Union, and China. The materials needed to compile these maps, such as information about power stations, mines, and whether roads "could withstand the use of tanks" in these areas, were all provided by the Cabinet Research Office.

Kimishima said that the Geographical Survey Institute's annual expenditure requires more than 500 million yen, of which 100 million yen is allocated by the "Self-Defense Forces."

    谎话拆穿　阴谋暴露
    日地理调查员揭露政府利用美国间谍飞机
    拍摄的中苏地区照片绘制军用地图
    据新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本政府建设省地理调查所所员君岛孟雄，在最近出版的“公论”周刊上揭露，从1957年以来，由这个地理调查所编制交给“防卫厅”的包括中国和苏联西伯利亚地方的航空地图，都是依靠美国陆军远东地图局提供的、用U—2型飞机拍摄的照片编绘的。
    在最近召开的众议院“安全条约”特别委员会会议上，社会党议员曾经指出了日本“自卫队”的侵略意图，并且要求政府公布这份地图材料的来源。
    当时，“防卫厅”长官赤城宗德答复说，这份地图是以国际民营航空机构提供的地图作为材料编制的。君岛孟雄在“公论”杂志上指出赤城宗德的答复是骗人的假话。
    君岛接着揭露，从1957年起，地理调查所还受“自卫队”的委托，编制了包括日本、苏联和中国全境在内的“警备详细地图”。编制这种地图所需要的材料，如关于这些地区的发电站、矿山以及公路“能不能经得起战车使用”等材料，都是由内阁调查室提供的。
    君岛说，地理调查所一年开支需要五亿多日元，其中一亿日元是由“自卫队”拨出的。
