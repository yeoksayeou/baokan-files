Still Fifty-Four Passengers
    Renshou

    This is a completely true story, common and ordinary in our country, yet extraordinarily moving...

    The international train from Beijing to Pingxiang departed from Beijing Station at 6:45 PM that day. More than six hundred passengers on the train, with feelings of parting and excitement, left beloved Beijing and headed for their respective work posts.

    All fifty-four sleeper tickets in Car No. 3 had been sold, but when the train departed, the passenger in the middle berth of No. 19 missed the train. All the passengers in the carriage were worried and anxious for him; the female attendant also felt regretful about this matter: one passenger was missing from the carriage she managed.

    The next day, as dawn broke, the first broadcast from the train's broadcasting room was not music, but an urgent report: a female passenger in berth No. 15 of Car No. 3 was experiencing abdominal pain. If there were any doctors or comrades with medical knowledge among the passengers, please go to her immediately for treatment. The report was repeated three times, and the passengers were awakened by the broadcast.

    At this time, an elderly male passenger climbed down from berth No. 26 of Car No. 3. Without even washing his face, he put on a woolen coat and walked to berth No. 15, pushing aside the concerned people gathered in front of the berth. He said to the female patient:

    "I am a doctor. May I examine you?"

    The female patient immediately blushed and did not answer.

    A young man in military uniform standing beside the berth excitedly said to the self-proclaimed doctor, "That's great! Old comrade, please quickly treat her – her stomach hurts!"

    The train's female health worker brought two pills: "Painkillers, they will make you feel better."

    The doctor said, "No! It's not appropriate to take painkillers before finding out the cause of the pain." After he finished speaking, he touched the patient's forehead; she did not have a fever. While checking her pulse, he asked about the patient's medical history. The patient said she had never suffered from gastrointestinal diseases.

    The doctor wanted to perform an abdominal examination on the patient, but many passengers were concerned and gathered nearby, making it inconvenient for the examination. The doctor turned to the young man in military uniform and asked, "Comrade, what is your relationship to her?"

    "Wife," the young man replied.

    The doctor pulled the young man aside and asked, "Is she pregnant?"

    The young man replied, "Yes, yes, it's almost time for delivery!"

    At this time, the patient cried out twice more. The doctor frowned and said, "She's about to give birth!"

    The attendant and passengers were stunned: "About to give birth?!"

    The doctor nodded: "She needs to be examined; can you find a small room?"

    The attendant quickly agreed, "Yes, yes." She and the pregnant woman's husband lifted the pregnant woman to the attendant's room. After the doctor examined the pregnant woman, he determined that she was about to give birth. Based on experience, the time from the onset of labor to delivery for first-time mothers is generally around twenty-four hours. Now, whether this pregnant woman can deliver smoothly according to the norm is difficult to predict. The safest way is to immediately send the pregnant woman off the train and to a hospital for delivery.

    The attendant said that there were thirty-two minutes until the train's scheduled stop at the next station, Luohe.

    The female train conductor arrived. The doctor discussed with the conductor: on one hand, the pregnant woman's husband should handle the disembarkation procedures at Luohe Station, and the train should telegraph Luohe Station to prepare an ambulance to meet the pregnant woman; on the other hand, preparations for delivery should be actively made on the train.

    The health worker brought a health kit to the doctor. The doctor opened it and saw that there were no delivery instruments or medicines. What to do? Solicit supplies from the passengers.

    The train's broadcasting room broadcast the message. Five minutes later, delivery supplies and substitutes such as gauze, cotton, sanitary paper, brandy, silk thread, and hemp thread, sent from various carriages, filled a table.

    The train was speeding, and the pregnant woman's labor pains were also accelerating in waves. There were now only twenty-three minutes left until the scheduled stop at Luohe!

    The doctor put on a mask and brushed his hands with his own toothbrush to wash them. The health worker sent the razor blade and silk thread to the dining car for boiling disinfection.

    When the doctor finished disinfecting and walked into the temporary delivery room, almost all the passengers in the entire carriage were quietly waiting outside the door.

    The young father's forehead was dotted with beads of sweat. He held his breath and stared at the "delivery room."

    At 8:25 AM, the mother gave birth! When the doctor delivered a white and chubby newborn baby, the train arrived at Luohe Station. The time was 8:28 AM. – After the rattling of the train wheels stopped, the cry of the new life began to sing!

    The passengers in each carriage continued to donate delivery supplies. The attendant ran to the broadcasting room to report the good news that the mother had given birth and that both mother and child were safe, thanking everyone for their care and support. Finally, she asked everyone to stop sending items.

    The good news spread to each carriage, and the entire train cheered! Then everyone sent gifts to the mother and baby: pastries, candies, small sweaters... constantly passed into the "delivery room."

    The doctor held the wrapped-up baby girl in his arms and walked out of the "delivery room." The passengers applauded and cheered. The doctor first congratulated the child's father, then placed the child on the empty berth of the passenger who had missed the train, smiling as he said to the attendant:

    "Now, your Car No. 3 still has fifty-four passengers!"

    还是五十四名乘客
    仁寿
    这是件完全真实的故事，在我们国家里是常见的，平凡的，而又异常动人……
    北京开往凭祥的国际列车于是日午后六时四十五分从北京站开出。全车六百多名乘客，怀着惜别和兴奋的心情，离开了可爱的北京，奔赴各个不同的工作岗位。
    三号车厢五十四张卧铺都卖出了车票，但在开车时，十九号中铺的旅客误车了。全车厢乘客都为他耽心和着急；女乘务员也为这件事情感到遗憾：她管理的车厢，少了一名乘客。
    第二天，晨曦微露，列车广播室第一次广播的不是音乐，而是一个紧急报告：三号车厢十五铺位一个女乘客发生腹痛现象，乘客中如有医生或懂得医学知识的同志，即刻前往诊治。报告连续了三遍，乘客们都被广播声惊醒了。
    这时，三号车厢第二十六号铺位上，爬下了一个老年男乘客，顾不得洗脸，披上一件毛绒衣，走到十五号铺位，拨开围在铺前的关心者们，对女患者说：
    “我是医生，能让我给您看看吗？”
    女患者顿时满脸绯红，没有回答。
    站在铺头边的一个穿军服的男青年，兴奋地对这位自我介绍的医生说：“这太好了！老同志，请你赶快给她治治吧，——她肚子疼！”
    列车女保健员拿来了两颗药丸：“止痛片，吃了就好。”
    医生说：“不行！在没有查出疼痛原因以前吃止痛剂，不妥当。”他说完摸摸患者的前额，没有发热。他一边诊察脉搏，一边询问患者的病史。患者诉说自己从未害过肠胃病。
    医生想给患者作腹部检查，但很多乘客关切地围在附近，不便检查。医生转问穿军服的青年：“同志，她是你的什么人？”
    “爱人。”青年回答说。
    医生将青年拉到一边，问：“怀孕了没有？”
    青年回答：“有，有，快到生产的时候了！”
    这时患者又叫了两声。医生皱了一下眉头，说：“她快要分娩了！”
    乘务员和乘客们顿时一怔：“要分娩了？！”
    医生点了点头：“需要检查；能找个小房间吗？”
    乘务员连忙答应：“行，行。”她跟孕妇的爱人将孕妇抬到乘务员室。医生给孕妇查完以后，确定孕妇即将分娩。根据经验，初产妇从发动到分娩的时间，一般约在二十四小时上下。现在，这个孕妇是否能按照规律顺利分娩，这就很难预断了。最安全的办法是，立即送孕妇下车，住院分娩。
    乘务员说，到达下站漯河停车的时间，还有三十二分钟。
    女列车长赶来了。医生跟列车长商量：一面请孕妇的爱人办理到漯河站下车的手续，由列车电请漯河站准备救护汽车迎接孕妇；一面在车上积极作好接生的准备工作。
    保健员给医生送来了一只保健箱。医生打开一看，没有接生器械和药材。怎么办？向乘客们征求。
    列车广播室播出了这个消息。五分钟后，从各节车厢里送来的纱布、棉花、卫生纸、白兰地、丝线和麻线等接生用品和代用品，堆满了一台子。
    列车在飞驰，孕妇的阵痛也在一阵阵地加速。现在距离漯河停车的时间，还有二十三分钟！
    医生戴上了口罩，用自己的牙刷刷手，洗手。保健员将刮胡子刀片和丝线送到餐车里进行煮沸消毒。
    当医生消毒完毕走进临时产房后，几乎整节车厢的乘客们都在门外静静地等待着。
    年青的父亲额上又冒出了几点汗珠，他屏住呼吸，两眼注视“产房”。
    八点二十五分，产妇分娩了！当医生接下了一个又白又胖的新生婴儿时，列车到达了漯河站。时间是八点二十八分。——轧轧的车轮声停息后，新生命的啼声开始鸣唱了！
    各节车厢的旅客，还在继续捐赠接生用品。乘务员跑到广播室，报告产妇已经分娩和母子平安的好消息，感谢大家的关怀和支援，最后，请大家停送物品。
    喜讯传到了各节车厢，全车欢腾！接着大家又向产妇和婴儿送礼：点心、糖果、小毛衣……不断地传进了“产房”。
    医生双手抱着包扎完毕的女婴儿走出“产房”，乘客们鼓掌欢呼。医生先向孩子的爸爸祝贺，后将孩子放在那张误车客人的空铺上，笑着对乘务员说：
      “现在，您的三号车厢，还是五十四名乘客！”
