    Breaking Down Factory Boundaries to Promote Collaboration, Conserve Labor and Materials, and Accelerate Production Leap Forward
    Xi'an Textile Mill and Dyeing Factory Achieve Continuous Production
    Beijing Many Units' Electricians Organized to Repair Electrical Equipment by Zone

    This Dispatch from Xi'an, May 27th: In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the Xi'an area textile mill and dyeing factory broke down factory boundaries and formed a joint production flow line, transforming originally intermittent production into continuous production. This is a new development in inter-factory communist collaboration.

    The Xi'an Textile Mill and the Xin'xibei Dyeing Factory, the Northwest First Dyeing Factory and the Northwest State-owned Cotton Mills No. 3, 4, and 5, are all very close, some separated by only a wall. However, originally, when the textile mill's products were transferred to the dyeing factory for processing, they had to go through more than ten processes in the finishing workshop, such as inspection, repair, brushing, stacking, packing, and printing, and then complete the factory exit procedures to hand over the cloth to the commercial department for transfer to the dyeing factory. After contacting the commercial department to complete the raw cloth entry procedures, the dyeing factory transported the raw cloth into the factory on trolleys and stored it in the warehouse. During dyeing, it had to be unpacked and inspected, and the cloth had to be sewn together before it could be singed and dyed. In this way, there was a lot of duplicated labor in the finishing workshop of the textile mill and the singeing workshop of the dyeing factory, wasting a lot of manpower and equipment. Sometimes, due to insufficient transportation capacity or failure to complete the raw cloth entry procedures in time, it also affected the dyeing factory's production. More seriously, many cloth would be wasted through several times of cutting and seaming. The Northwest State-owned Cotton Mills No. 3, 4, and 5 and the Northwest First Dyeing Factory, would cut off tens of thousands of meters of small cloth strips of about one centimeter each year due to cutting and joining.

    In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the workers of the textile mill and the dyeing factory actively suggested breaking down factory boundaries and forming a joint production flow line. The Party organization of the Shaanxi Provincial Textile Administration Bureau actively supported the workers' suggestions. The Party committees of the various factories also organized workers to discuss this issue. The workers said: What we are doing now is a technical revolution, and since it is a revolution, we should get rid of anything that is not conducive to production; if we cannot even break through a wall between factories, what kind of revolution is it? After discussion and unifying understanding, the workers of various factories and departments took active action to put forward suggestions and provide material conditions to promote the formation of a joint production flow line. Under the leadership of the Party committee secretaries of the two factories, the workers of the Xi'an Textile Mill and the Xin'xibei Dyeing Factory broke through the wall separating the two factories; and the joint production line was built in five or six days. After that, the cloth woven by the Xi'an Textile Mill no longer went through the finishing workshop, but was directly sent to the singeing workshop of the dyeing factory through an automatic line. The Xi'an Textile Mill and the Xi'an Knitting Factory jointly established a joint production flow line to reduce the complicated procedures between the factory exit (textile factory) and factory entry (knitting factory) of cotton yarn. The workers of the Northwest State-owned Cotton Mills No. 3, 4, and 5 and the Northwest First Dyeing Factory also jointly established a joint production flow line.

    The joint production flow line of the textile mill and the dyeing factory has not been established for long, but its benefits have already become apparent. According to preliminary calculations, after the Northwest State-owned Cotton Mills No. 3, 4, and 5 and the Northwest First Dyeing Factory established a joint production line, they can save more than 8,300 square meters of building area for factories and finished product warehouses, save 445 workers, and save 66 sets of equipment such as cloth stacking machines, cloth drying machines, brushing machines, and packing machines, saving 48,900 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, saving a total of more than 960,000 yuan.

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing.

    This Dispatch: In the great collaboration movement of power supply and utilization, many electricians scattered in power-using units in Beijing have adopted the practice of changing from working individually to mutual assistance, organizing "People's Power Line Stations" by zone, which has achieved good results in reasonably using manpower and improving the quality of line inspection and maintenance. Now there are already 47 "People's Power Line Stations" in the city, and half of the more than 12,000 electricians in various power-using units have been organized.

    The electricians of various power-using units in Beijing have always only done general electrical maintenance work within their own units, and the electrical equipment outside the enterprise gates is managed by the power supply bureau. This decentralized mode of operation, on the one hand, causes electricians to be unevenly busy and idle, and on the other hand, the potential of electrical maintenance instruments and tools cannot be fully utilized. Organizing "People's Power Line Stations" is to organize the electricians and electrical instruments scattered in various units according to region and line, and use them uniformly (the organized electricians are still subject to the administrative organization leadership of the original unit). Entrusted by the Beijing Power Supply Bureau, the electricians of each "Power Line Station" are responsible for the maintenance of public electrical equipment in the vicinity of their units, in addition to completing the maintenance of electrical equipment in their own units. The benefits of doing this are:

    First, manpower and equipment can support and adjust each other, thereby saving a large amount of labor and equipment. The more than 6,000 electricians who have been organized and the 47 "People's Power Line Stations" can save more than 10% of manpower. At the same time, these originally scattered electricians have stepped out of the scope of work of their own units and assumed part of the maintenance work of public electrical equipment, which makes it possible for the electricity management department to concentrate manpower and material resources to carry out the installation and maintenance of advanced electrical equipment.

    Second, the technical level of electricians can be improved. After the electricians are organized, it is possible to establish learning organizations, carry out technical learning and research, and exchange experiences, providing good conditions for improving the level of operating technology.

    Third, safety and power saving. In the past, the workload of the power supply bureau's line inspectors was about 33 kilometers per person, and they often could not manage it. Accidents were not discovered in time, and they were not handled in time. In the event of natural disasters such as wind, thunder, rain, and snow, no matter how far away the accident location was, special personnel and vehicles had to be sent to repair it, prolonging the power outage time and causing losses. After the establishment of "People's Power Line Stations", each electrician of each "People's Power Line Station", in addition to their own job, also undertakes the maintenance work of an average of about 450 meters of lines. They are more familiar with the lines and power consumption in their area, carry out reasonable dispatch, and can find and solve problems such as equipment defects in time, which not only ensures safety but also reduces power consumption. For example, after the electricians on Wenjiao North Road were organized, they often inspected the electrical equipment in the area, and adopted the method of "limiting power without cutting off the road", which can save more than 100,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity.

    Fourth, electricians move from various units to a larger scope of work, their horizons are broadened, which is more conducive to further developing the communist style of cooperation. For example, the Beijing Light Industry Machinery Factory lacked knife switches affecting production, and the Beijing Timber Factory immediately tapped the potential of equipment and organized electricians to help solve the problem. Twenty or thirty technical innovation projects of the Beijing Food Factory that could not be connected to electricity for a while were quickly connected to the power supply with the organization and assistance of the "People's Power Line Station", ensuring that the innovation projects were put into production in time.

    打破厂界大搞协作  节约人力物力  促进生产跃进
    西安纺织厂印染厂实现连续性生产
    北京许多单位的电工组织起来分片维修电气设备
    本报西安27日电　西安地区纺织厂和印染厂在技术革新和技术革命运动中，打破厂界，组成一条联合生产流程线，使原来间断性的生产变成了连续性的生产。这是厂际间共产主义协作的新发展。
    西安纺织厂和新西北印染厂，西北第一印染厂和西北国棉三、四、五厂，都靠得很近，有的只有一墙之隔。但是，原来纺织厂的产品转到印染厂去加工，需要经过整理车间的检验、分修、刷布、码布、打包、打印等十多道工序，再办理出厂手续，把布交给商业部门转印染厂。印染厂和商业部门联系办理原布入厂手续后，把原布用架子车运进厂内，存放在仓库里。印染时，要经过拆包和检验，把一匹一匹的布缝在一起，然后才能进行烧毛和漂染。这样，纺织厂的整理车间与印染厂的烧毛车间的重复劳动就很多，浪费了很多人力和设备。有时，因为运输力量不足或不能及时办理原布入厂手续，还影响印染厂的生产。更严重的是，经过几次剪裁、接缝，会浪费很多布。西北国棉三、四、五厂和西北第一印染厂，每年由于开剪、接头而裁下来的一公分左右的小布条就有几万米。
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，纺织厂和印染厂的职工积极建议打破厂界，组成联合生产流程线。陕西省纺织管理局党组织积极支持群众的建议。各厂党委也组织职工就这个问题进行了讨论。工人们说：我们现在搞的是技术革命，既然是革命，就应该把那些不利于生产的东西都革掉；连厂与厂之间的一道墙都不能冲开，还算什么革命？通过讨论，统一认识以后，各厂各部门的职工，都积极行动起来，提建议，提供物质条件，促进联合生产流程线的形成。西安纺织厂和新西北印染厂在两个厂的党委书记领导下，职工们把分隔两厂的围墙打通了；又用五、六天的时间，这条联合生产线就建成了。此后，西安纺织厂织的布，不再经过整理车间，而是通过自动线直接送到印染厂的烧毛车间。西安纺织厂同西安针织厂一起建立联合生产流程线，减少棉纱出厂（纺织厂）和入厂（针织厂）之间的繁杂手续。西北国棉三、四、五厂和西北第一印染厂的职工们，也共同建立联合生产流程线。
    纺织厂和印染厂的联合生产流程线建立不久，但是，它的好处已经显示出来了。据初步计算，西北国棉三、四、五厂和西北第一印染厂建立联合生产线后，可以节约厂房和成品仓库的建筑面积八千三百多平方米，节约职工四百四十五人，节约码布机、烘布机、刷布机、打包机等设备六十六台，每年节约用电四万八千九百度，总计可节约资金九十六万元以上。
    本报讯　在供用电大协作运动中，北京市许多分散在用电单位的电工，采用了变单干为互助，分片组织成“人民保线站”的做法，对合理使用人力，提高巡查和维修线路的质量，收到了良好的效果。现在全市已经出现了四十七个“人民保线站”，各用电单位的一万二千多名电工已有半数组织起来。
    北京各用电单位的电工历来都是只作本单位内部的一般电气维修工作，企业门外的电气设备都由供电局管理。这种分散作业的方式，一方面使电工忙闲不均，另一方面电气维修用的仪表、工具潜力也不能得到充分的发挥。组织“人民保线站”，就是把分散在各单位的电工、电气仪表按地区和线路组织起来，统一使用（组织起来的电工仍受原单位行政组织领导）。各“保线站”的电工受北京供电局的委托，除完成本单位的电气设备维修等工作外，还分片包干担负本单位附近地区的公用电气设备的维修等工作。这样作的好处是：
    第一、人力和设备可以互相支援互相调剂，从而节省了大批劳动力和设备。现在已组织起来的六千多名电工，四十七个“人民保线站”即可节省10％以上的人力。同时，这些原来分散的电工跳出了本单位工作的范围，担负起了一部分公用电气设备的维修工作，就使电业管理部门有可能集中人力物力进行高级电气设备的安装和维修工作。
    第二、可以提高电工的技术水平。电工组织起来后，就有可能成立学习组织，进行技术的学习和研究，交流经验，对提高操作技术水平提供了良好的条件。
    第三、安全省电。以前，供电局巡线员的线路维修工作量每人约三十三公里，往往管不过来，发现事故不及时，处理也不及时；有风、雷、雨、雪等自然灾害，不论事故地点有多远，也得专人专车去修理，延长了停电时间，造成损失。成立“人民保线站”后，各“人民保线站”的每个电工除本职工作外，平均又担负四百五十米左右线路的维修工作。他们对所属区域线路和用电情况比较熟悉，进行合理调度，并对设备缺陷等问题可以及时发现，及时解决，既保证了安全，也减少了电力的消耗。如文教北路的电工组织起来后，经常对所在区的电气设备进行检查，采用“限电不拉路”的办法，可节约电十万多度。
    第四、电工们从各个单位走向较大的工作范围，眼界开阔了，对进一步发扬共产主义协作之风，更为有利。如北京轻工业机械厂缺乏刀闸影响生产，北京市木材厂立即挖掘设备潜力并组织电工帮助解决了这个问题。北京市食品厂一时接不上电的二、三十项技术革新项目，在“人民保线站”的组织协助下，很快接上了电源，保证革新项目及时投入了生产。
