Xinhua News Agency report: The sowing of spring coarse grains in the southern provinces and regions has basically concluded. This year, the early, abundant, and high-quality sowing of spring coarse grains is a victory achieved by the people's communes in the southern provinces and regions under the guidance of the principle of "taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward."

According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture on April 23, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces and regions have sown over 70 million mu of various spring coarse grains, exceeding the original sowing plan for these seven provinces and regions by more than one fold. In addition, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces and regions have planted more than 22 million mu of spring sweet potatoes and potatoes. This year, the sowing of coarse grains in various parts of the south generally started about a month earlier than last year. This staggering of agricultural seasons facilitates labor arrangements and resolves the perennial conflict between early rice transplanting and coarse grain sowing for labor resources. Early sowing can avoid late-season droughts, extend the growing season of crops, and increase yields. Early sowing also enables early harvests, facilitating production and living arrangements.

The area sown with spring coarse grains in the southern provinces and regions is much larger than in any previous year. Guizhou, Sichuan, and Guangxi provinces and regions have sown over 38 million mu of spring corn, an increase of nearly one and a half times compared to last year. The expansion of the coarse grain sowing area is mainly due to the active and vigorous reclamation of wasteland by people's communes in various parts of the south, making full use of idle land, and engaging in intercropping and interplanting to ensure that every inch of land is utilized. Approximately 46% of the coarse grains and tubers sown in Guangxi were planted on newly reclaimed land, and 26% of the coarse grains sown in Hunan were also planted on newly opened land. Hunan also made full use of over 2.8 million mu of idle land to grow various crops, including over one billion pumpkin seedlings alone. The QianDongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture in Guizhou Province adopted a forest-grain intercropping system, and the forest-grain intercropping area in Jinping, Liping, Kaili, Jianhe, and other counties increased by one to nine times compared to last year. The Lile Commune in Xinhui County, Guangdong, has planted over 18,000 mu of spring crops, half of which were planted by utilizing scattered open spaces and adopting intercropping and interplanting methods.

The sowing quality of coarse grains in the south this year is better than in any previous year. Seven special districts and cities, including Fuling in Sichuan Province, inspected over 4.3 million mu of spring corn that had been sown. The vast majority were deeply ploughed to depths of eight inches to one foot two inches or more. Among the more than 3.4 million mu of corn, 42.4% applied over 20,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, 32.6% applied 10,000 to 20,000 jin, and 25% applied less than 10,000 jin. Reasonable close planting was achieved on over 3.3 million mu of corn. When sowing in the Shunde area of Fanshun County, Guangdong, the weather was dry, so over 100,000 people, 49 water pumps, 3,000 waterwheels, and over 110,000 water-lifting tools were organized for a concentrated effort to combat drought, ensuring the timely sowing of over 200,000 mu of dryland crops. Due to the good sowing quality, the early-sown corn has grown to one to two feet tall and is lush and sturdy. In Hunan Province, coarse grain crops have emerged evenly with tall seedlings and thick stalks.

In order to achieve a bumper harvest of spring-sown coarse grain crops, all localities promptly put forward the slogan "Plant one mu well, manage one mu well, and harvest one mu," and organized forces to check seedlings and replant, weed and topdress, and strengthen the prevention and control of pests and diseases and the soil and water conservation of mountain slopes.

Xinhua News Agency report: The sowing of spring crops has been widely launched in state farms across the country. The vast number of workers on the state farm front have launched a vigorous upsurge in spring sowing production, making this year's sowing work both fast and of high quality.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Land Reclamation, by mid-April, state farms across the country had sown over 20 million mu of various crops. The sowing of early spring crops, mainly spring wheat, in the Mudanjiang Reclamation Area of Heilongjiang Province is nearing completion. The sowing of spring wheat in state farms in the Xinjiang Reclamation Area has basically concluded, and cotton is being sown in a concentrated effort. By April 10, state farms in Guangdong Province had completed 80% of their spring sowing tasks, and the Zhanjiang, Foshan, and other reclamation areas had successively overfulfilled all of their spring sowing tasks.

This year's spring sowing work in state farms across the country has greatly exceeded any previous year in terms of early start, rapid progress, and high quality. The spring sowing time in various localities is generally about half a month earlier than in previous years, achieving timely early sowing. Farms in various localities have further implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and improved the quality of sowing.

The spring sowing area in various reclamation areas this year is much larger than last year. State farms in various localities have vigorously promoted technical innovation and technical revolution around spring sowing production. During the more than one month of preparation and spring sowing, state farms in the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps created and modified 35 types of important machines for sowing, land preparation, fertilization, and other tasks. Among them, 24 new machines increased efficiency several times to dozens of times compared to manual operation. State farms in the Huangfan District, Boai, and Banqiao of Henan Province created a spring sowing machine for applying water and fertilizer, which also increased work efficiency by more than ten times, greatly accelerating the sowing progress.

The spring sowing preparation work of state farms this year is better than any previous year. Since last winter, state farms in various localities have actively reclaimed wasteland and expanded the area of cultivated land. To date, over 10 million mu of wasteland have been reclaimed. Many state farms have proposed to open and sow simultaneously, achieving benefits in the same year. Reclamation areas in Xinjiang and Heilongjiang and many state farms in Gansu, Yunnan, and other provinces have leveled land and harrowed to conserve moisture before spring sowing. Various fertilizers were also vigorously accumulated and manufactured last winter and this spring, more and better than in any previous year.

    种得早　种得多　种得好
    南方七省春播杂粮超过计划一倍
    全国各国营农场掀起气势磅礴的春播生产高潮
    据新华社讯　南方各省区春杂粮的播种工作已基本结束。今年春杂粮种得早、种得多、种得好，这是南方各省区人民公社在以粮为纲、全面跃进的思想指导下，取得的一项胜利。
    据农业部4月23日的统计，四川、贵州、云南、广西、广东、湖南、江西七省区已播种各种春杂粮七千多万亩，超过七省区原订播种计划面积的一倍以上。此外，四川、贵州、云南、广西、广东、湖南、江西和福建八省区，已种春甘薯和马铃薯两千二百多万亩。今年南方各地杂粮播种普遍比去年提早一个月左右。这就错开了农事活动季节，便于安排劳力，解决了历年春季插早稻与播种杂粮互相争劳力的矛盾。早种可以避开尾旱，可以延长作物的生长期，提高产量；早种还可以早收获，便于安排生产和生活。
    南方各省区春种杂粮的面积比以往任何一年都扩大得多。贵州、四川、广西三个省区已播春玉米三千八百多万亩，比去年扩大近一倍半。杂粮播种面积的扩大，主要是南方各地人民公社积极大力开垦荒地，充分利用闲散地，大搞间种套种，做到见缝插针，寸土不闲。广西已播的杂粮和茹类有46％左右是种在新垦的耕地上，湖南已播的杂粮也有26％种在新开出的耕地上，湖南还充分利用闲散土地二百八十多万亩种植各种农作物，其中仅南瓜就种了十亿多蔸。贵州黔东南苗族侗族自治州采取林粮混作，仅锦屏、黎平、凯里、剑河等县，林粮混作面积分别比去年扩大一倍到九倍。广东新会县礼乐公社已种的一万八千多亩春种作物，有一半是利用零星空地和采取间种、套种的办法种植的。
    今年南方杂粮的播种质量比过去任何一年都好。四川省涪陵等七个专、市检查了四百三十多万亩已播的春玉米，绝大多数深耕八寸到一尺二寸以上，在三百四十多万亩玉米中，施底肥二万斤以上的占42.4％，一、二万斤的占32.6％，一万斤以下的占25％；在三百三十多万亩玉米中，都做到了合理密植，广东番顺县顺德地区在播种时天旱，就组织十多万人，四十九部抽水机，三千架水车和十一万多件提水工具，进行突击抗旱，保证了二十多万亩旱地作物及时播种。由于播种质量较好，目前早种的玉米已长一尺到二尺高，葱绿茁壮。湖南省杂粮作物出苗整齐，苗高秆粗。
    为了夺取春播杂粮作物的丰收，各地都及时提出了“种好一亩，管好一亩，丰收一亩”的口号，并组织力量进行查苗补苗，锄草追肥，并加强对病虫害的防治和山坡地的水土保持工作。
    据新华社讯　全国各地国营农场春种农作物的播种工作已经普遍展开。国营农场战线上的广大职工，掀起了一个气势磅礴的春播生产高潮，使今年播种工作进度既快，质量又好。
    据农垦部统计，到4月中旬全国各国营农场已经播种各种农作物二千多万亩。黑龙江省牡丹江垦区以春小麦为主的早春作物播种工作即将结束，新疆垦区各国营农场春小麦播种已经基本结束，正在突击播种棉花，广东省各垦区到4月10日已经完成80％的春播任务，其中湛江、佛山等垦区都已经先后超额完成了全部春播任务。
    今年各地国营农场的春播工作，无论就动手之早、进展之快、质量之高，都大大超过了以往任何一年。各地春播时间一般都比往年提前半月左右，做到了适时早播。各地农场都进一步贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，提高了播种质量。
    今年各垦区的春播面积比去年扩大了很多。各地国营农场围绕着春播生产大闹技术革新和技术革命。新疆军区生产建设兵团各国营农场在一个多月的备耕和春播当中，创造和改制各种播种、整地、施肥等重要机具达三十五种。其中有二十四种新机具比人工操作提高几倍到几十倍。河南省黄泛区、博爱、板桥等国营农场，创造出春播施水施肥机，工效也提高了十几倍，大大加快了播种进度。
    今年国营农场的春播准备工作比以往任何一年都做得好。从去冬以来，各地国营农场积极开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积，到目前为止，已开垦荒地一千多万亩。许多国营农场都提出边开边种，当年开当年收益。新疆、黑龙江的垦区和甘肃、云南等省的许多国营农场，都在春播前进行了平整土地，耙地保墒。去冬今春各地还大搞积肥、造肥，积造的各种肥料比过去任何一年都多，都好。
