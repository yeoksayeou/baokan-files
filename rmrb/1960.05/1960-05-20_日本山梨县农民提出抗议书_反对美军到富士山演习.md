Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 15th: Japanese farmers from Yamanashi Prefecture submitted a protest letter to the US Embassy in Japan and Japanese government authorities yesterday, resolutely opposing the stationing of US military forces from Okinawa in mainland Japan to conduct military exercises on Mount Fuji.

　　The farmers demanded that the Japanese government urge the US military stationed in Okinawa to cancel the military exercises on Mount Fuji.

　　The protest letter pointed out that the unauthorized deployment of US military forces stationed in Okinawa to mainland Japan for exercises is an infringement upon Japanese sovereignty.

　　The US Navy Command stationed at Yokosuka base in Japan had notified the Fujiyoshida City Hall in Yamanashi Prefecture and neighboring village offices on the 13th that the US military would conduct live ammunition shooting exercises at the North Fuji training grounds from May 16th to 21st. This notification from the US military aroused the indignation of local farmers. They organized the "Association to Protect Mount Fuji and Water," and decided to fight against the US military authorities.

　　According to reports, the Japan Socialist Party is preparing to criticize the Nobusuke Kishi government in the Diet over this incident.

　　Famous lawyer Shinichi Unno stated in an interview published in the "Asahi Shimbun" yesterday that this incident proves that no matter which unit of the US military intrudes into Japan, Japan's sovereignty will be undermined, and Japan may fall into a very dangerous state. Unno emphasized that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs should lodge a protest with the United States regarding this incident.

    日本山梨县农民提出抗议书
    反对美军到富士山演习
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本山梨县农民代表20人昨天向美国驻日本大使馆和日本政府当局提交抗议书，坚决反对驻冲绳美军开到日本内地，在富士山进行军事演习。
    农民们要求日本政府促使驻冲绳美军取消在富士山的军事演习。
    抗议书指出，驻冲绳美军擅自开到日本内地进行演习，是对日本主权的侵犯。
    驻在日本横须贺基地的美国海军司令部曾经在13日通知山梨县富士吉安市政府和邻近村公所，美军将从5月16日到21日在北富士演习场举行实弹射击演习。美军这个通知激起了当地农民的愤慨。他们组织了“保卫富士山与水协会”，决定同美军当局进行斗争。
    据报道，日本社会党准备就这个事件在国会抨击岸信介政府。
    著名律师海野晋吉昨天在“朝日新闻”上发表谈话指出，这件事情证明，无论美军那一个部队闯进日本，日本的主权都将遭到破坏，日本有可能陷入非常危险的状态。海野强调指出，日本外务省应当就这次事件向美国提出抗议。
