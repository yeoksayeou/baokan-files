Heighten Vigilance and Make Persistent Efforts
*People's Daily* Commentator

As the scale and momentum of the Japanese people's actions against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty grow, and as the end of the Japanese Diet session approaches, the Kishida Nobusuke group's situation becomes increasingly difficult. However, the Japanese reactionaries, headed by the Kishida Nobusuke group, do not retreat in the face of difficulties; on the contrary, they are adopting all despicable and shameless means in an attempt to force the Japanese Diet to pass the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty on the 20th, or at the latest on the last day of the session (the 26th). According to a Japan Broadcasting Corporation broadcast on the 16th, the countermeasures that Kishida Nobusuke and Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Masajiro Kawashima and others have decided to take are: "on the one hand, leave some leeway," that is, extend the Diet session depending on the situation; "on the other hand, take tough measures." Obviously, this is a two-pronged approach of both soft and hard tactics by the Kishida Nobusuke group. It attempts to use long-term delays to relax the Japanese people's will to fight against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and also prepares to combine open suppression and force the treaty through when the masses are caught off guard. Many signs indicate that the United States and the Kishida Nobusuke group have prepared for this conspiracy. Therefore, it cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of the Japanese people, and it cannot but arouse the close attention of all those who care about the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle.

It should be known that the Kishida Nobusuke group originally conspired to force the House of Representatives to pass this treaty before April 26, so that it could complete the legal procedures for ratifying this military alliance treaty before the Diet session closed on May 26. Because according to the Japanese Constitution, if the House of Councillors fails to pass this treaty within thirty days of the Diet session, the decision of the House of Representatives shall be regarded as the decision of the Diet. It was only because this conspiracy of the Kishida Nobusuke group has been frustrated under the strong opposition of the Japanese people that they have again attempted to adopt means of extending the session and even using armed suppression to ratify the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and present it as a "gift" to U.S. President Eisenhower, who is scheduled to visit Japan on June 19.

Many of the recent remarks made by the Kishida Nobusuke group have fully exposed their conspiracy to forcibly ratify the treaty at this Diet session, not hesitating to have the ruling party conduct "separate deliberations" and rely on a majority of seats to conduct "separate votes." According to Kyodo News, Kishida Nobusuke once stated that "no matter how long the discussion is, the basic ideas are different." He asked the members of the Liberal Democratic Party to "unite as one" and follow him in "finding a way" to get the treaty passed in this Diet session. In addition, the Kishida Nobusuke group decided that the Liberal Democratic Party would pass a resolution to extend the Diet session around the 20th, and agreed to "extend the Diet session for at least one month." It is worth noting that Masajiro Kawashima, Kishida Nobusuke's confidant and Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, has greatly attacked the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. He slandered the Japanese people's petition to the Diet as "training for violent revolution," claiming that the petition movement "concentrates people on violent revolution and conducts training," and so on. It must be pointed out that Kawashima's remarks are by no means accidental, but reveal the criminal conspiracy of the Kishida Nobusuke government. One of its purposes is to mobilize the strength within the ruling group; to intimidate and coerce all those within the ruling party who are dissatisfied with Kishida Nobusuke's policy of following the United States and opposing China and the Soviet Union with the people carrying out "violent revolution," and to cooperate in the matter of forcibly ratifying the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. But more importantly, this is to create an excuse for the Kishida Nobusuke group to openly suppress the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle. Hasn't the Kishida Nobusuke group repeatedly stated that it "will do everything possible" to pass the treaty at this Diet session? Among these countless "possibilities" naturally include the "tough measures" it recently publicly announced. Moreover, all reactionaries in the world always like to put hats such as "violent revolution" on the people's heads before launching an attack on the people, and then carry out bloody suppression. What's more, Kishida Nobusuke himself has used the same methods against the Japanese people more than once in the past. In fact, the Kishida Nobusuke group is indeed stepping up its actions. According to the "Sankei Shimbun" on the 13th, the Kishida Nobusuke group is deploying police to the Diet to obstruct the opposition parties from forcibly approving the new "Security Treaty." The Japanese "Public Security Investigation Agency" also convened a meeting of national police chiefs on the 12th to plot suppression actions. Fujii, the director of the "Public Security Investigation Agency," made it clear that the spearhead of suppression and persecution is directed at the Japanese people's "broad anti-American and anti-government mass unified action," and at the Japanese people's "national democratic united front." However, the Kishida Nobusuke group is afraid that relying solely on the police force will not be enough at the "critical moment." According to the "Tokyo Shimbun," the Japanese "Defense Agency" is further strengthening the training of the army to suppress mass movements in preparation for emergencies.

The above-mentioned signs are a dangerous signal for the broad masses of the Japanese people. It shows that the Japanese reactionaries, headed by the Kishida Nobusuke group, are prepared to launch an attack on the Japanese people who are adhering to the patriotic and just struggle at any time, which deserves the high vigilance of the Japanese people. Today, the Kishida Nobusuke group's conspiracy to use armed suppression does not show its strength, but precisely proves that the vigorously developing struggle of the Japanese people has made the Kishida Nobusuke group increasingly isolated, desperate, and has to resort to armed suppression. In the past few unified actions held by the Japanese people, the Kishida Nobusuke group also carried out large-scale arrests and persecutions. But the result was counterproductive, arousing even greater anger and resistance from the people, and prompting more people to participate in the struggle. If the Kishida Nobusuke group continues to launch attacks on the people in the future, the result can only be to accelerate its own demise.

    提高警惕再接再厉
    本报评论员
    随着日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的行动规模越来越大、声势越来越壮，随着日本国会会期的临近结束，岸信介集团的处境日益困难。然而，以岸信介集团为首的日本反动派并不知难而退；相反的，正在采取一切卑鄙无耻的手段，企图在20日、最迟也要在会期的最末一天（26日）以前强使日本国会通过日美军事同盟条约。据日本广播协会电台16日消息，岸信介和自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎等人已经决定采取的对策是：“一方面留有余地”也就是看情况延长国会会期；“一方面采取强硬措施”。显而易见，这是岸信介集团软硬兼施的两手。它既企图利用长期拖延来松懈日本广大人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争意志；也准备结合公开镇压，在群众措手不及的情况下强行通过条约。许多迹象表明，美国同岸信介集团已就这一阴谋进行了准备。为此，不能不引起日本人民的严重警惕，也不能不引起所有关心日本人民爱国正义斗争的人们的密切注意。
    要知道，岸信介集团原来阴谋在4月26日以前强使众议院通过这项条约，以便能在5月26日国会会议闭幕以前完成批准这个军事同盟条约的法律手续。因为根据日本宪法规定，如果参议院在国会开会的三十天内不能通过这项条约，众议院的决定就算作国会的决定。只是由于岸信介集团的这一阴谋已经在日本人民的强烈反对下遭到挫败，它们才又妄图采取延长会期甚至武力镇压的手段，来批准日美军事同盟条约，向预定在6月19日访问日本的美国总统艾森豪威尔“献礼”。
    岸信介集团最近发表的许多谈话，已充分暴露了它们为实现在这次国会会议上强行批准条约的阴谋，不惜由执政党“单独审议”，并依仗多数议席“单独表决”。据共同社报道，岸信介就曾表示“无论进行多么长时间的讨论，基本思想也是不同的。”他要求自由民主党的议员们“团结一致”，跟随着他在这次国会中“设法”使条约获得通过。此外，岸信介集团决定在20日前后由自由民主党通过延长国会会期的决议，并商定“最低限度要延长国会会期一个月”。值得注意的是岸信介的亲信、自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎对于日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争大肆攻击。他诬蔑日本人民到国会请愿是“暴力革命的训练”，什么请愿运动“使人集中于暴力革命，而进行训练”等等。必须指出，川岛的这番话绝非偶然，而是透露了岸信介政府的罪恶阴谋。它的目的之一，就在动员统治集团内部的力量；以人民进行“暴力革命”来恫吓和要挟执政党内所有对岸信介追随美国、敌视中苏的政策表示不满的人，在强行批准日美军事同盟条约的问题上进行合作。但更重要的，这是为岸信介集团对日本人民的爱国正义斗争进行公开镇压制造借口。岸信介集团不是曾经一再表示“要尽一切可能”在这次国会会议上通过条约吗？这无数“可能”中间自然包括它最近公开宣布的“强硬措施”了。何况世界上所有的反动派当它们向人民发动进攻的时候，总喜欢把“暴力革命”之类的帽子先加在人民的头上，然后进行血腥镇压。更何况岸信介本人过去已不止一次地对日本人民采用过同一手段。事实上，岸信介集团也的确在加紧行动。据日本“产经新闻”13日透露，岸信介集团正在部署警察到国会里阻挠在野党反对强行批准新“安全条约”。日本“公安调查厅”12日也召集全国警察头子开会策谋镇压行动。“公安调查厅”长官藤井明白指出，镇压和迫害的矛头是针对着日本人民“广泛的反美、反政府群众性的统一行动”，针对日本人民的“民族民主统一战线”的。但是，岸信介集团唯恐在“紧要关头”只依靠警察的力量还不够。据“东京新闻”报道，日本“防卫厅”正在进一步加强对陆军进行镇压群众运动的训练，以备不时之需。
    上面的这些迹象，对于日本广大人民来说是一个危险的信号。它表明以岸信介集团为首的日本反动派准备对坚持爱国正义斗争中的日本人民随时发动进攻，值得引起日本人民高度的警惕。今天，岸信介集团阴谋使用武力镇压，不是表现它的强大，恰恰是证明了日本人民蓬勃发展的斗争，已使得岸信介集团日益孤立、走投无路，而不得不乞灵于武力镇压。在日本人民过去举行的几次统一行动当中，岸信介集团也曾大肆逮捕迫害。但是结果适得其反，激起了人民更大的愤怒和反抗，促使更多的人参加斗争。岸信介集团今后如果继续对人民发动进攻，结果也只能是加快它自身的灭亡。
