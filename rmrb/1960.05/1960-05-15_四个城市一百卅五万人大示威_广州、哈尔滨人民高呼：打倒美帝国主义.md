Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 14th: Today, six hundred thousand people in Guangzhou City braved the rain to hold massive demonstrations and rallies on the city's main thoroughfares and in the suburban rural areas in support of the Japanese people's opposition to the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

This afternoon, the central venue of Yuexiu Mountain was packed with people who came to attend the rally. Although it was raining heavily, the masses were in high spirits, waving their fists and shouting slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" and "Resolutely support the Japanese people's opposition to the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty!"

Responsible comrades of the Party, government, and army of Guangdong Province who attended the central venue of Yuexiu Mountain included: Chen Yu, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPC and Governor of Guangdong Province; Zhao Wucheng and Liang Xiang, Secretaries of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the CPC; and Major General Xiao Yuanli, Commander of the Guangzhou Garrison. Responsible comrades of democratic parties and people's organizations in the province and city, as well as consuls of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Vietnam, and other countries in Guangzhou, and foreign friends in Guangzhou also attended the rally. Mr. Hatanaka Masaharu, head of the Japanese delegation to the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, Managing Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and Secretary of the Japan Peace Committee, also attended the rally and was warmly welcomed by the masses.

Zhu Guang, Standing Committee Member of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPC, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the CPC, and Mayor of Guangzhou, spoke at the rally. He said: The people of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City resolutely support the just struggle of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and express their high respect to the heroic and unyielding Japanese people. He said: The Japanese people have friends all over the world. In the past, all the sabotage and suppression by U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke government failed to stop the continuous advancement of the Japanese people's just struggle. Today, they are even less able to stop the massive struggle of all the Japanese people. He said that the people of China and Japan have established a fighting friendship in the common struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people have always regarded supporting the Japanese people's struggle as their sacred duty. We firmly believe that no matter how tortuous the road of the Japanese people's struggle, no matter how arduous the struggle, as long as the Japanese people, with the support of the people of the world and the Chinese people, strengthen unity, make persistent efforts, and persevere in the struggle to the end, they will surely be able to crush the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance, completely drive the forces of U.S. imperialism out of Japan, and final victory will surely belong to the great Japanese people.

Hatanaka Masaharu then spoke amidst warm applause from the audience. He said: The Japanese people thank the Chinese people for their support of the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. When he said, "Chinese friends, the Japanese people resolutely oppose Japan becoming a base for U.S. aggressive war, the Japanese people resolutely oppose the Diet's ratification of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and the Japanese people must fight side by side with Chinese friends to overthrow U.S. imperialism," the audience burst into thunderous applause. Representatives from the municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Women's Federation, local organizations of democratic parties, and various circles also spoke at the rally. At the end of the rally, the "Message to the People of All Circles in Guangzhou City in Support of the Japanese People's Opposition to the Japan-U.S. Military Alliance Treaty" was unanimously adopted. After the rally, a demonstration was held. Mass rallies and demonstrations were also held in various districts of the city today. Angry masses held up many cartoons, banners, and huge slogans. One cartoon depicted the people of Japan, Turkey, South Korea, and Cuba holding ropes in their hands, tightening the noose around the neck of U.S. imperialism.

Among the demonstrators were many victims and witnesses of the Japanese imperialist invasion of China. The husband of the old woman Huang Ranhe was stabbed to death by the Japanese invading army during the War of Resistance Against Japan, one daughter died after being tortured by the Japanese invading army, and another daughter starved to death during the Japanese invasion of China. She said: "My other children have grown up, our people are strong, and U.S. imperialism is trying to revive Japanese militarism to invade us. We will never agree!" Yang Basao, who had lived on the Pearl River for generations, was once held down by three Japanese invading soldiers with sharp knives at her throat and humiliated. At that time, she was preparing to commit suicide by throwing herself into the river in despair, but only decided to live on with tears in her eyes because she heard the crying of a forty-day-old girl on the boat. Huang Yanhua, who lost five children to starvation during the Japanese invasion of China, joined Yang Basao in today's demonstration in the rain, chest held high. She said that she would persist in the struggle against U.S. imperialism's revival of Japanese militarism.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 14th: Harbin, a major city in Northeast China that was once under the bloody rule of Japanese militarism for fourteen years, held a massive rally this afternoon in the Anti-Japanese Martyrs Memorial Tower Square with 500,000 people in support of the Japanese people's opposition to the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

Starting at noon, workers, cadres, members of urban people's communes, students, fully armed militia, and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Harbin gathered from all directions towards the venue, holding up placards and huge cartoons. Among these angry crowds were old soldiers of the former Anti-Japanese Allied Army and people who had suffered deeply from the persecution of Japanese militarism. The members of the Pingfang Urban People's Commune in Harbin, where Japanese militarism once established a germ warfare factory fifteen years ago, were even more indignant at the crimes of U.S. imperialism in reviving Japanese militarism. Jing Fuhe, a member of this commune, accused Japanese militarism of its crimes, saying: "The inhumane Japanese militarism established a germ warfare factory in Pingfang, which caused a plague there. Thirteen members of my family died in less than a month, leaving my family broken and ruined. I will never forget this blood feud with the Japanese fascists."

The city-wide rally in support of the Japanese people's opposition to the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty began at 2:30 p.m. Responsible comrades from the leading organs, various organizations, and democratic parties of Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City attended the rally. Mr. Yamazaki Shunichi, Secretary-General of the Japanese General Council of Trade Unions' Delegation to China, and some members of the delegation also attended the rally. Also attending the rally were Soviet Deputy Consul in Harbin, Oshaqi, and Soviet experts in Harbin.

Zhang Ruilin, Standing Committee Member of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the CPC, spoke on behalf of the Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee at the rally. He said that 500,000 people in Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City solemnly gathered today to express the firm support of the people of the entire province for the Japanese people's opposition to the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. U.S. imperialism, which is reviving the forces of Japanese militarism, is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan. The Chinese people have fresh memories of the deep disasters caused by the Japanese imperialist invasion of China. Especially in our Northeast, which was under the bloody rule of Japanese imperialism for fourteen years after the "September 18th Incident," countless compatriots were massacred and trampled upon by the Japanese fascists. We will never forget this blood feud, and we will never allow U.S. imperialism to revive Japanese militarism!

Li Yanlu, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and Yamazaki Shunichi, Secretary-General of the Japanese General Council of Trade Unions' Delegation to China, also spoke at the rally. Yamazaki Shunichi, on behalf of the Japanese working class, expressed his deep gratitude to the people of Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City for their strong support for the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. He said that under no circumstances would the vast majority of the Japanese people want to fight the Chinese people again. His speech was warmly applauded by the audience.

After the rally, 500,000 people held a demonstration.

    新华社广州14日电　广州市今天有六十万人在市内的通衢大道和郊区的农村中，冒雨举行了规模巨大的支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的示威游行和集会。
    今天下午，在越秀山中心会场上挤满了前来参加大会的群众。虽然当时正下着初夏的骤雨，但群众情绪激昂，人们挥着拳头，高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约！”等口号。
    参加越秀山中心会场的广东省党、政和军队的负责人有：中共广东省委书记、广东省省长陈郁，中共广州市委书记赵武成、梁湘，广州驻军首长萧元礼少将等。省、市各民主党派、各人民团体负责人和捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、越南等国家驻广州领事和在广州的外国友人也参加了大会。第二届亚非人民团结大会日本代表团团长、日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会总务常任理事、日本和平委员会书记畑中政春也参加了大会，受到到会群众的热烈欢迎。

    畑中政春接着在全场热烈的掌声中讲话，他说：日本人民对中国人民支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争表示感谢。当他说到“中国朋友们，日本人民坚决反对日本成为美国侵略战争的基地，日本人民坚决反对国会批准日美军事同盟条约，日本人民一定要和中国的朋友们并肩地为打倒美帝国主义而奋斗”的时候，全场掌声雷动。在大会上讲话的还有市工会、团市委、市妇联和各民主党派地方组织以及各界代表。大会结束时，全场一致通过了广州市各界人民支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约大会通电。大会结束后举行了示威游行。全市各区今天也举行了群众大会和示威游行。愤怒的群众举着许多漫画、横额和巨幅标语，有一幅漫画上画着：英勇的日本、土耳其、南朝鲜、古巴各国的人民手里执着的绳索，正套紧着美帝国主义的脖子。
    在示威的队伍中，有着众多的日本帝国主义侵略中国时的受害者和见证人。老妈妈黄冉荷的丈夫在抗日战争期间被日本侵略军刺死，一个女儿受到日本侵略军的折磨后死去，另一个女儿也在日本侵略中国期间活活饿死。她说：“我的另外几个孩子长大了，我们的人民强大了，美帝国主义妄想复活日本军国主义来侵略我们，我们决不答应！”世世代代居住在珠江水上的杨八嫂，当时曾被三个日本侵略军用利刀按着咽喉受到侮辱的，那时她在绝望中正在准备投江自杀，只是因为听了艇上刚生下来四十天的女孩的哭声，才决定含着眼泪活下来。在日本侵略中国期间饿死了五个孩子的黄燕华，今天和杨八嫂一起挺胸膛冒雨参加了示威，她表示要为反对美帝国主义复活日本军国主义而坚持斗争。
