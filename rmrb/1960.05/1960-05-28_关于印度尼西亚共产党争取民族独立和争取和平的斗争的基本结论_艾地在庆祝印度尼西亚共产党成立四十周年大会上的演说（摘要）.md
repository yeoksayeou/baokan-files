Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 26th: D.N. Aidit, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, delivered a speech at a mass rally in Jakarta on May 23rd celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian Communist Party, entitled "Basic Conclusions on the Struggle of the Indonesian Communist Party for National Independence and Peace."

The Basic Experience
of Forty Years of Struggle

Aidit summarized the basic experiences of forty years of struggle in the first part of his speech. He said that the development of the Indonesian Communist Party can be basically divided into four periods or four stages.

The first period was the period of the party's founding and the struggle against the first White Terror (1920-1926).

The second period was the period of underground activities and the anti-fascist front (1926-1945).

The third period was the period of the August Revolution of 1945 and the struggle against the second White Terror (1945-1951).

The fourth period is the period of the national front and strengthening the party (1951 to the present).

Aidit said: The first, second, and part of the third period, that is, up to 1948, was the period when the party was still in its infancy. During these periods, the party's revolutionary activities and fighting spirit were very high, so its prestige in the eyes of the people was also very high. However, even so, the party was still in its infancy because it had little experience on three basic issues: the united front, party building, and armed struggle. The party did not understand the historical conditions and situation of Indonesian society, the characteristics of the Indonesian revolution, and the laws of the Indonesian revolution; it did not grasp the theory of Marxism-Leninism, and in this case, it certainly could not lead the revolution that broke out in August 1945. The infancy ended with the adoption of the "New Road" resolution in August 1948.

In the middle of the third period, that is, in August 1948, the Indonesian Communist Party began to reach maturity. The 1945-1948 revolution provided the Indonesian Communist Party with many experiences and lessons.

Aidit said in his report that many of the experiences of this period (the third period) began to be summarized at the party congress in August 1948, which produced the resolution on the "New Road for the Republic of Indonesia"; the Fifth National Congress in 1954 further improved this resolution. These included the following conclusions: Regarding the issue of consolidating the national front, this period gave us important experience in the wavering attitude of the national bourgeoisie; it told us that in some cases this class could participate in the revolution and stand firmly on the side of the revolution, but in other cases it might waver or betray. When uniting the national bourgeoisie, the party must never abandon its independence, and it must never exclude its most reliable and largest ally—the peasantry.

He said: Regarding the issue of building the party, this period gave us important experience that it is impossible to lead the revolution without the theory of Marxism-Leninism as a guide to action rather than a dogma; it gave us an experience: the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism must be combined with the concrete practice of the Indonesian revolution.

In addition, this period also made the Indonesian Communist Party realize that in the revolution, armed struggle is the most important form of struggle. The development of the party depends to a large extent on the national front, and to a large extent on armed struggle. The rise and fall of armed struggle has a great influence on the rise and fall of the united front and the party.

The party came to a very important conclusion, that is: if the party could have seen at that time that the solution to the problem lay in combining the three forms of struggle—guerrilla warfare in the countryside (especially involving the peasants), the revolutionary actions of workers (especially transport workers) in enemy-occupied cities, and intense work in the enemy's armed forces—then it would have been possible to expand and consolidate the guerrilla war during the August Revolution of 1945, and as a result, the August Revolution would have been possible to complete thoroughly. The method of combining the three forms of struggle is extremely important; it is part of the theory of the Indonesian revolution, part of the theory of winning victory in guerrilla warfare in an archipelago country like Indonesia.

Aidit said, but this understanding and realization came too late, that is to say, it was understood and realized after the Indonesian Communist Party was no longer in the government, when the revolution was already in decline; this means that this understanding and realization could no longer prevent the occurrence of bourgeois betrayal. This is primarily because the party did not have a solid foundation among the peasants after the bourgeoisie colluded with the Dutch colonialists and betrayed the revolution through the Madiun provocation.

The 1945-1948 revolution actually opened up great possibilities for the party's development to maturity.

But this was not achieved, because theoretical work did not receive enough attention from the party leadership, and also because the party was in a state of chaos, with three Marxist-Leninist parties existing at that time, the Indonesian Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Indonesian Workers' Party, while the illegal Indonesian Communist Party continued to function. Because subjective ideas, namely dogmatism and empiricism, still dominated during this period, the party made right and "left" mistakes, greatly damaging the development of the party and the revolutionary movement.

The party congress in August 1948 considered this right-leaning and "left"-leaning opportunistic subjective thinking. However, obviously, this assessment was not complete. Only at the plenary session of the Central Committee in October 1953 was this issue finally resolved; the resolutions of this meeting were approved by the Fifth National Congress of the party in March 1954. The party, which had begun to reach maturity after the adoption of the "New Road" resolution, became a completely mature party after this congress, because it had answered all the important and basic questions of the Indonesian revolution, and fully understood the theory of the Indonesian revolution—a product of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the concrete practice of the Indonesian revolution.

The Fifth National Congress (1954) summarized the experiences of the fourth period—the period of the national front and strengthening the party. The Fifth National Congress decided that the Indonesian Communist Party today has two urgent tasks, namely the task of consolidating the national front and the task of continuing to build the party.

Regarding the national front, the party concluded that it must wage a struggle against two tendencies—the right tendency and the "left" tendency. The right tendency lies in exaggerating the significance of unity with the national bourgeoisie and underestimating the significance of the leadership of the working class and the alliance of workers and peasants. This is the danger of abandoning the party's independence, the danger of dissolving the party with the bourgeoisie. The "left" tendency, which must also be opposed, is sectarianism, which is the attitude of not attaching importance to the united front with the national bourgeoisie and not making every effort to defend this united front.

Establishing a united front with the national bourgeoisie opens up the possibility of developing and building the party, opens up the possibility of carrying out the party's most immediate work, which is: consolidating the anti-feudal alliance of workers and peasants. Party building and the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance are the ways to ensure the leadership of the proletariat in the national united front.

Regarding the opposition to dogmatism and empiricism, the Fifth National Party Congress emphasized that it is important to develop the working methods that distinguish the Indonesian Communist Party from the bourgeois parties, which can be simply called the working method of integrating theory with practice, closely linking with the masses of the people, and carrying out self-criticism.

Aidit said that the lesson that can be drawn from the above experiences and conclusions is the importance of revolutionary theory. Without theory or with wrong theory, a situation favorable to the development of the party and the revolutionary movement can become harmful to the development of the party and the revolutionary movement. However, theory can enable the party to get out of difficult situations, and it can advance the revolutionary movement step by step.

The Indonesian Communist Party put forward a theory that there are three forces in Indonesia today—progressive forces, middle forces, and die-hard forces—and the correctness of this theory has been proven. The party's policy towards these three forces is: develop progressive forces, unite middle forces, and isolate die-hard forces. In the process of uniting the middle forces, the party also wages struggle. The party unites the middle forces against imperialism and feudalism; however, if they want to narrow the party's freedom and the freedom of action of the working people, the party will wage struggle against them.

The Indonesian Communist Party put forward a theory that in armed struggles like the 1945-1948 revolution, the party must never copy the theories of armed struggle of other countries, it must implement the method of combining these three forms of struggle. If the party had implemented this method at that time, the situation of the 1945-1948 revolution would have been different.

The Indonesian Communist Party put forward a theory that in order for the Indonesian revolution to win victory, party members and the masses of working people must have a spirit of combining patriotism and proletarian internationalism. Indonesian communists must wage a struggle against national nihilism and chauvinism. The Indonesian revolution is not isolated from the world revolution that is now developing rapidly; the Indonesian revolution is part of the world's progressive forces, part of the struggle of the world's people for national independence, for democracy, peace, and socialism.

The Indonesian Communist Party put forward a theory that in order to lead political development, the party must follow the general policy: continue to consolidate the national front, continue to build the party, in order to thoroughly complete the requirements of the revolution of a national democratic nature in August 1945. The party's general policy of consolidating the national front is: to consolidate the unity between workers, peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie based on the anti-feudal worker-peasant alliance led by the working class. The party's general policy on party building is: to build the party throughout the country, a party with a broad mass base, completely consolidated ideologically, politically, and organizationally.

Aidit pointed out that in all cases, the party must be able to Indonesianize Marxism-Leninism. This is indeed a difficult task; it requires determination and hard work, and we still have many things to do in this regard, but this must be done by Indonesian communists.

On the Deceptive Remarks
about False "Socialism"

In the second part of his speech, Aidit refuted the deceptive remarks about false "socialism." Aidit said that at present, the word "socialism" is sold like hotcakes in our country. From government officials to national capitalists, from civilians to soldiers, from schoolchildren to former colonial bureaucrats, from lenders to landlords, in short, everyone talks about "socialism" or "Indonesian-style socialism." The times prove that the victory of socialism in the world is not only certain, but also very near.

Since the end of World War II, since socialism has achieved victory in many countries, and since the socialist system has increasingly proved its superiority, therefore, if the word "socialism" is sold like hotcakes in Indonesia, we don't need to be surprised, especially now that the Indonesian people have seen for themselves that after fifteen years of independence in our country, the capitalist political and economic system has increasingly exposed its inability to solve the problems faced by the majority of the Indonesian people.

Aidit said: If many people talk about "socialism" or "Indonesian-style socialism," should we communists oppose it? Of course not. If people have enough courage to talk about socialism, then it is a step forward compared to not talking about socialism at all or condemning socialism. Should we worry that some people are engaging in deception? The answer is no again. Because today, socialism is so concrete, it is such a living force, so deception is easy to recognize. Socialism is no longer an abstract theory, it is something that is living vigorously, and this is also the case for the Indonesian masses. Many Indonesian people already know what socialism is, so the people cannot be deceived, especially the class consciousness of the Indonesian working class and working people has greatly increased today, enough to distinguish socialism from "socialism."

Aidit said that now some people say that the Indonesian Communist Party agrees with socialism, but does not agree with adding the word "Indonesian-style." Before answering this point, I would first like to ask: What do you mean by saying "Indonesian-style"? Does "Indonesian-style socialism" refer to "feudal socialism," "bourgeois socialism," or "petty-bourgeois socialism"? If this is what you mean by the word "Indonesian-style," then we, who are loyal to the theory of Marx, not only disagree with it, but also oppose it. He also said that but if you say "Indonesian-style socialism" refers to socialism, real socialism, that is: as explained in the 1959 political manifesto of the Republic of Indonesia, a society without exploitation of man by man, established according to the conditions existing in Indonesia, then we not only do not oppose it, but absolutely agree with it, in fact, this is what our party has been fighting for since it was founded forty years ago, and many communists have already given their lives for it.

Aidit pointed out that the Indonesian Communist Party is as lush as a banyan tree with many roots, deeply rooted in the soil, with thick branches and a good place to provide shade. The Indonesian Communist Party is more native than many things that claim to be "native" and "national," but cannot grow on Indonesian soil. Those who have the right to say what is native or not national are not those "chirping monkeys" trained as part of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, graduates of foreign spy schools, but the Indonesian people, especially the creative working people.

Aidit continued, perhaps some people will say, yes, but the Indonesian Communist Party wants a socialist society led by the working class. Gentlemen, this is not what we want, this is a historical necessity, if we really want to build a socialist society, no class is more unwavering in the struggle for a socialist society than the working class. Moreover, in theory, there has never been socialism led by a bourgeoisie or a feudal landlord, and even more so in practice.

Aidit said: But we are also willing to talk about more practical things. Since "Indonesian-style socialism" is a social system without exploitation of man by man, therefore, we believe that it is self-contradictory for those who follow this social system not to pay attention to eliminating the rule of foreign big capitalists and landlords first. Moreover, it is even worse to strengthen the position of foreign big capitalists and maintain the landlord system within the scope of practicing "Indonesian-style socialism." If this is exactly what is being done, then it is winning people over, it is deception.

Therefore, precisely in order to realize socialism sometime in the future, the spearhead of our struggle today must be directed at the most direct and most vicious enemies, namely: first, at the imperialists, specifically the foreign big capitalists; second, at feudalism, specifically the landlords who exploit millions of peasants. In other words, we must thoroughly complete the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, thoroughly complete the national democratic revolution, as a "gateway" to entering socialist society.

It is deceiving the people to talk about socialism without taking action to completely eradicate the influence of imperialism and feudalism in economic, political, social and cultural aspects.

It is deceiving the people to talk about socialism without resolutely resisting the most dangerous enemy of the people of all countries today, including the Indonesian people—the head of world imperialism, the US imperialists. It is deceiving the people to talk about socialism without resolutely resisting the unscrupulous Dutch colonialists who are constantly strengthening themselves in West Irian. It is deceiving the people if one does not resist the "Democratic League" which is spreading policies that have the potential to divide the nation, creating conflicts and engaging in provocations. The "Democratic League" – the alliance between the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party – is only two months old, but the people have been able to see clearly that their policies are almost identical to those of the US imperialists and the Dutch imperialists.

That is why all patriotic forces, especially those who agree with socialism, must cooperate closely and fight actively to frustrate the policies of the Dutch and the Americans, to frustrate their agents who are creating chaos in our country, and must further destroy everything that provides the basis for these reactionary political forces, that is, foreign big capitalists and the landlord system. This is the only correct path to socialism that is in line with Indonesia's conditions.

Recent Developments in the Domestic Political Situation

The third part of Aidit's speech talked about recent developments in the domestic political situation.

Aidit said: Following the talks in Tampaksiring, Bali (Editor's note: the talks held by President Sukarno with the leaders of the three major political parties in March), the Indonesian political situation marks two situations of bankruptcy.

Aidit pointed out: First, the die-hard forces are further bankrupt. They are more isolated than ever before because they stubbornly stand on the side of the counter-revolution. The establishment of the completely undemocratic "Democratic League" cannot save them from bankruptcy. They frantically attack the communists, attack the forces that firmly oppose imperialism, and attack the truly enlightened people.

In just two months, the "Democratic League" has nakedly revealed itself as the successor to various "secret meetings," preparing for the second counter-revolutionary wave of the "Charter of Total Struggle" rebel group.

Aidit pointed out: The reactionaries hope to repeat the events of 1948, that is, to attack the communists through provocations, in order to open the door for the Dutch troops, while the Dutch troops are conducting military preparations in West Irian to attack the Republic of Indonesia. Aidit reminded the Indonesian people to continue to be vigilant.

Aidit said: Second, the claims of those who oppose the party system have also gone bankrupt. The Tampaksiring talks strengthened the party system. However, the claim to abolish the party system has not been completely defeated. Certain anti-democratic and anti-people political adventurers still want to use the establishment of a national front to "abolish parties and groups." The responsibility of all the Indonesian people is to support and consolidate the national front. Their responsibility also lies in maintaining the national front so that it continues to be a place for all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal classes and groups, various political parties, various organizations, and individuals to gather and cooperate, in order to make Indonesia completely independent and democratic, and to pave the way for it to enter socialist society based on Indonesia's conditions.

Aidit said: Attempts to "abolish parties and groups" by establishing a national front run counter to the true intention of establishing a national front. Therefore, if such an attempt is forced through, it will be opposed by the people, just as the people oppose the actions of adventurers. He said: The modern history of Indonesia proves that Indonesian society has always been a class society, and it is impossible to abolish political parties.

He finally said: All roads lead to victory, no matter how difficult the road that the Indonesian people will follow. The development of progressive forces, the increasingly close unity between progressive forces and middle forces, and the decline of die-hard forces, this process is continuing to develop. The duty of the Indonesian Communist Party lies in accelerating this process, by more firmly and actively implementing the party's general line—continue to build the national front, continue the work of party building, in order to thoroughly complete the revolution of August 1945.

There is no doubt that the development of Indonesian politics, the development of modern history of Indonesia, will depend to a large extent on this glorious general line.

    关于印度尼西亚共产党争取民族独立和争取和平的斗争的基本结论
    艾地在庆祝印度尼西亚共产党成立四十周年大会上的演说（摘要）
    新华社雅加达26日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会主席艾地5月23日在雅加达的一次群众大会上发表了一篇庆祝印度尼西亚共产党成立四十周年的演说，题目是“关于印度尼西亚共产党争取民族独立和争取和平的斗争的基本结论”。
  四十年斗争
  的基本经验
    艾地在他的演说的第一部分总结了四十年斗争的基本经验。他说，印度尼西亚共产党的发展基本上可以分为四个时期或四个阶段。
    第一个时期是党的成立和反对第一次白色恐怖的斗争的时期（1920年—1926年）。
    第二个时期是从事地下活动和反法西斯阵线的时期（1926年—1945年）。
    第三个时期是1945年8月革命和反对第二次白色恐怖的斗争的时期（1945年—1951年）。
    第四个时期是民族阵线和加强党的时期（1951年直到目前）。
    艾地说：第一时期、第二时期和第三时期的一部分，也就是一直到1948年，是党仍旧处在幼年阶段的时期。在这些时期中，党的革命活动和斗争精神非常高涨，因此它在人民眼里的威望也非常高。但是，即使如此，党仍旧处在幼年阶段，因为它在三个基本问题上还没有什么经验：统一战线问题，党的建设问题和武装斗争问题。党不了解印度尼西亚社会的历史条件和情况、印度尼西亚革命的特点和印度尼西亚革命的规律；它没有掌握马克思列宁主义的理论，在这种情况下，它当然没有能够领导1945年8月爆发的革命。幼年时期随着1948年8月“新的道路”的决议的通过而宣告结束。
    在第三个时期的中期，也就是在1948年8月，印度尼西亚共产党开始达到成熟的程度。1945年—1948年革命使印度尼西亚共产党得到了许多经验和教训。
    艾地在他的报告中说，这个时期（第三个时期）的许多经验在1948年8月的党代表会议上开始得到总结，这次会议上产生了关于“印度尼西亚共和国的新的道路”的决议；1954年的第五次全国代表大会又使得这项决议更加完善了。其中包括下列一些结论：关于巩固民族阵线的问题，这一时期使我们对民族资产阶级的动摇态度取得了重要的经验；它告诉我们，在某些情况下这个阶级能够参加革命和坚定地站在革命一边，但是在另外一些情况下它可能动摇或叛变。党在团结民族资产阶级的时候，决不能放弃自己的独立性，它决不能排斥它的最可靠的最大的同盟军——农民。
    他说：关于建设党的问题，这一时期使我们得到了重要的经验，即如果没有马克思列宁主义的理论作为行动的指南而不是教条，那就不可能领导革命；它使我们得到一条经验：马克思列宁主义的普遍真理必须同印度尼西亚革命的具体实践相结合。
    此外，这个时期还使印度尼西亚共产党认识到，在革命中，武装斗争是最重要的斗争形式。党的发展除了在很大程度上取决于民族阵线以外，在很大程度上还取决于武装斗争。武装斗争的消长对统一战线和党的消长有很大的影响。
    党得出了一个非常重要的结论，那就是：如果党在当时能够看到解决问题的办法就在于把三种斗争形式——农村中（特别牵涉到农民）的游击斗争、敌人占领的城市中工人们（特别是运输工人）的革命行动和在敌人武装部队中的紧张工作——互相结合起来，那时就会有可能扩展和巩固1945年8月革命时期的游击战争，结果八月革命就会有可能彻底完成。把三个斗争形式结合起来的方法是极其重要的，这是印度尼西亚革命的理论的一部分，在印度尼西亚这样的群岛国家的游击战争中赢得胜利的理论的一部分。
    艾地说，但是，这种理解和认识到得太晚了，这也就是说，这是在印度尼西亚共产党已经不再在政府里的时候，在革命已经在低落的时候理解和认识到的；这意味着，这种理解和认识已经不再能够使革命避免资产阶级叛变的发生。这首先是因为，在资产阶级同荷兰殖民主义者共谋而通过茉莉芬挑衅事件背叛革命以后，党在农民中间没有坚强的基础。
    1945年—1948年革命实际上为党的发展成熟打开了极大的可能。
    但是这一点没有能够实现，因为理论工作没有得到党的领导足够的注意，并且也因为党内处于混乱状态，当时存在着三个马克思列宁主义的政党，印度尼西亚共产党、社会党和印度尼西亚工人党，而处于非法地位的印度尼西亚共产党仍旧继续发生作用。因为主观主义的思想，即教条主义和经验主义，在这个时期内仍旧居于优势地位，所以党犯了右的和“左”的错误，大大损害了党和革命运动的发展。
    1948年8月的党代表会议考虑了这种右倾和“左”倾机会主义的主观主义思想。但是，显然，这种估计还不完全。只是在1953年10月的中央委员会全体会议上这个问题才最后得到解决；这次会议的各项决议得到了1954年3月党的第五次全国代表大会的同意。在通过“新的道路”决议以后已经开始达到成熟程度的党，经过这次代表大会就成了完全成熟的政党，因为它已经解答了印度尼西亚革命的一切重要的和基本的问题，完全领会了印度尼西亚革命的理论——马克思列宁主义普遍真理同印度尼西亚革命具体实践相结合的产物。
    第五次全国代表大会（1954年）归纳了第四个时期——民族阵线和加强党的时期——的经验。第五次全国代表大会决定，印度尼西亚共产党今天有两项迫切的任务，即巩固民族阵线的任务和继续建设党的任务。
    关于民族阵线，党得出的结论是必须同两种倾向——右的倾向和“左”的倾向——展开斗争。右的倾向在于夸大了同民族资产阶级的团结的意义而低估了工人阶级的领导的意义和工农联盟的意义。这就是放弃党的独立性的危险，把党同资产阶级溶合的危险。同样也必须加以反对的“左”的倾向就是宗派主义，就是不重视同民族资产阶级的统一战线和不尽一切力量保卫这种统一战线的态度。
    同民族资产阶级建立统一战线就打开了发展和建设党的可能性，打开了开展党的最眼前的工作的可能性，这也就是：巩固工人和农民的反封建的联盟。党的建设和工农联盟的巩固是保证民族统一战线中无产阶级的领导的办法。
    关于反对教条主义和经验主义，第五次全国党代表大会强调指出，发展使印度尼西亚共产党有别于资产阶级政党的工作方法是很重要的，这就是可以简单称之为理论联系实际、密切联系人民群众和开展自我批评的工作方法。
    艾地说，从上述经验和结论中可以得出的教训就是革命理论的重要性。没有理论或者说有了错误的理论，对党和革命运动的发展有利的形势可以变成对党和革命运动有害的形势。但是，理论可以使党摆脱困难的情况，它可以把革命运动一步一步向前推进。
    印度尼西亚共产党提出了这样一个理论，即印度尼西亚今天存在着三种力量——进步力量、中间力量和顽固势力，而这种理论的正确性已经得到证明。党对这三种力量的方针是：发展进步力量，团结中间力量和孤立顽固势力。在团结中间力量的过程中，党也展开斗争。党团结中间力量反对帝国主义和封建主义；但是，如果他们想缩小党的自由和劳动人民的行动自由，党就对他们展开斗争。
    印度尼西亚共产党提出了这样一种理论，即在1945年—1948年革命期间那样的武装斗争中，党决不能抄袭其他国家武装斗争的理论，它必须执行把这三种斗争形式结合起来的方法。如果党当时实行了这种方法，1945年—1948年革命的情况就会不同。
    印度尼西亚共产党提出了这样一种理论，即为了使印度尼西亚革命赢得胜利，党员和劳动人民群众必须具有爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义相结合的精神。印度尼西亚共产党人必须对民族虚无主义和沙文主义展开斗争。印度尼西亚革命同现在正在快速开展的世界革命并不是隔绝的；印度尼西亚革命是世界进步力量的一部分，世界人民争取民族独立、争取民主、和平和社会主义的斗争的一部分。
    印度尼西亚共产党提出了这样一种理论，即为了领导政治的发展，党必须遵循总的方针；继续巩固民族阵线，继续建设党，以彻底完成1945年8月革命这一民族民主性质的革命的要求。党的巩固民族阵线的总方针是：巩固以工人阶级领导的反对封建的工农联盟为基础的工人、农民、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级之间的团结。党关于建设党的总方针是：在全国各地建设党，一个具有广泛群众性的、在思想上、政治上和组织上完全巩固的党。
    艾地指出，在一切情况下，党必须能够把马克思列宁主义印度尼西亚化。这的确是一件困难的工作；这需要有决心和艰苦的努力，而我们在这方面还有许多事情要做，但是这一定必须要由印度尼西亚共产党人来做。
      关于假“社会主义”
          的欺骗性言论
    艾地在演说的第二部分中，驳斥了关于假“社会主义”的欺骗性的言论。艾地说，在目前，“社会主义”这个字眼在我国像热饼一样地出售。从政府官员起到民族资本家，从平民到军人，从学童到前殖民地官僚，从放债者到地主，总之，每一个人都脱口而出地谈论“社会主义”或“印度尼西亚式的社会主义”。时代证明，社会主义在全世界的胜利不但是肯定的，而且，这种胜利已经非常临近了。
    第二次世界大战结束以来，既然社会主义已经在许多国家内取得了胜利，既然社会主义制度日益证明它的优越性，因此，如果“社会主义”这个字眼在印度尼西亚像热饼一样的出售，我们不必感到奇怪，特别是现在印度尼西亚人民已经自己看到，在我国独立十五年以后，资本主义政治和经济制度已经愈来愈暴露出它不能够解决大多数印度尼西亚人民所面临的问题。
    艾地说：如果许多人谈论“社会主义”或“印度尼西亚式的社会主义”，我们共产党人要不要反对呢？当然不。如果人们有足够的胆气来谈论社会主义，那么较之根本不谈社会主义或谴责社会主义，是一个进步。我们应不应担心有些人进行欺骗呢？回答又是不。因为今天，社会主义是这样具体，是这样一种活生生的力量，所以欺骗是很容易认出来的。社会主义不再是一种抽象的理论，它是一种在生气勃勃地生活着的东西，对于印度尼西亚群众来说，也是这样。许多印度尼西亚人民已经知道社会主义是什么，所以人民是欺骗不了的，特别是印度尼西亚工人阶级和劳动人民的阶级觉悟今天已大大提高了，足以区别社会主义和
  “社会主义”。
    艾地说，现在有些人说，印度尼西亚共产党同意社会主义，但是不同意加上“印度尼西亚式的”这个字眼。在回答这一点以前，我首先想问一问：你说“印度尼西亚式的”是什么意思？“印度尼西亚式的社会主义”是不是指“封建社会主义”、“资产阶级社会主义”，或是“小资产阶级社会主义”？如果这就是你所谓“印度尼西亚式的”这个字眼的意思，那么，忠实于马克思理论的我们，不但不同意，而且反对它。他还说，但是，如果你说“印度尼西亚式的社会主义”，指的是社会主义，真正的社会主义，那就是：如1959年印度尼西亚共和国政治宣言所阐述的那样，根据印度尼西亚所存在的条件建立的，一个没有人剥削人的社会，那么我们不仅不反对，而且绝对同意，实际上，这就是我们党在四十年前成立以来一直为之奋斗、而且有许多共产党人已经为之付出自己生命的东西。
    艾地指出，印度尼西亚共产党就像一棵有许多根子的榕树一样地茂盛，深深地扎入土中，枝干粗壮，是一个很好的遮荫的地方。印度尼西亚共产党比许多自称“土生土长的”和“民族的”、但是不能在印度尼西亚土地上生长的东西更加来得土生土长。有权利说什么东西是土生土长的或者是不是民族的，并不是那些作为东南亚条约组织的活动的一部分训练出来的“吱吱喳喳的猴子”、外国间谍学校毕业生，而是那些印度尼西亚人民，特别是有创造性的劳动人民。
    艾地继续说，也许有些人要说，不错，但是印度尼西亚共产党要的是由工人阶级领导的社会主义社会。先生们，这不是我们所要求的东西，这是历史的必然性，如果我们真要建立社会主义社会的话，没有一个阶级比工人阶级更加坚持不渝地为社会主义社会而斗争。此外，在理论上还没有由一个资产阶级或封建地主领导的社会主义，在实践上更加如此。
    艾地说：但是，我们也愿意谈谈比较实际的事情。既然“印度尼西亚式的社会主义”是没有人剥削人的一种社会制度，所以我们认为：遵循这种社会制度的那些人不首先注意消除外国大资本家和地主的统治，那是自相矛盾的。而且，如果要在奉行“印度尼西亚式的社会主义”的范围内加强外国大资本家的地位并保持地主制度，那就更恶劣了。如果所作的正是那样，那就是笼络人心、就是欺骗。
    所以，正是为了在将来某时实现社会主义，我们今天斗争的矛头必须指向最直接和最凶恶的敌人，即：一、指向帝国主义者，具体对象就是外国大资本家；二、指向封建主义，具体对象就是剥削着千百万农民的地主。换句话说，我们必须彻底完成反帝反封建革命、彻底完成民族民主革命，作为进入社会主义社会的“门径”。
    如果不采取行动来完全铲除帝国主义和封建主义在经济、政治、社会和文化方面的影响而空谈社会主义，那就是欺骗人民。
    如果不坚决抵抗今天作为世界各国人民，包括印度尼西亚人民的最危险的敌人——世界帝国主义的头子美帝国主义者——而空谈社会主义，那就是欺骗人民。如果不坚决抵抗现在正在西伊里安不断加强自己的肆无忌惮的荷兰殖民主义者而空谈社会主义，那就是欺骗人民。如果不抵抗正在传播分裂民族潜力的政策并制造冲突和从事挑衅的“民主联盟”而空谈社会主义，那就是欺骗人民。“民主联盟”——马斯友美党和印度尼西亚社会党之间的联盟——只有两个月的历史，但是人民已经能够清楚地看出，他们的政策是同美帝国主义者和荷兰帝国主义者的政策几乎一模一样的。
    这就是为什么，一切爱国力量，特别是同意社会主义的那些力量，必须紧密地合作、积极地进行斗争，来挫败荷兰人以及美国人的政策，挫败在我国制造混乱的他们的代理人，并且必须进一步摧毁为这些反动政治势力提供基础的一切，那就是外国大资本家和地主制度。这是符合印度尼西亚的情况的、走向社会主义的唯一正确途径。
  国内政治形势最近的发展
    艾地讲话的第三部分谈到国内政治形势最近的发展。
    艾地说：继在巴厘的坦帕克斯林举行会谈（编者按：苏加诺总统同三大政党领袖在3月间举行的会谈）之后，印度尼西亚政治形势标志出两种破产的情况。
    艾地指出：首先，顽固势力进一步破产。他们远比以前更加孤立，因为他们顽固地站在反革命的一边。完全不民主的“民主联盟”的建立，也不能把他们从破产中拯救出来。他们疯狂地打击共产党人，打击坚定地反对帝国主义的力量，打击真正开明的人们。
    仅仅两个月的时间，“民主联盟”就赤裸裸地暴露出自己是各种“秘密会议”的继承者，准备“全面斗争约章”叛乱集团的第二个反革命浪潮。
    艾地指出：反动派希望重演1948年事件，即通过挑衅打击共产党人，以便为荷兰部队敞开大门，而荷兰部队正在西伊里安进行军事准备来向印度尼西亚共和国进攻。艾地提醒印度尼西亚人民要继续提高警惕。
    艾地说：第二，那些反对政党制度的人们的主张也破产了。坦帕克斯林的会谈加强了政党制度。可是要取消政党制度的主张并没有完全被打倒。某些反民主和反人民的政治冒险家，仍然想利用建立民族阵线来“取消政党和集团”。全体印度尼西亚人民的责任是支持和巩固民族阵线。他们的责任还在于保持民族阵线，使之继续成为一切反帝和反封建阶级和集团、各政党、各团体以及个人集会和合作的场所，以便使印度尼西亚完全独立和民主，为依据印度尼西亚的情况使之进入社会主义社会开辟途径。
    艾地说：企图通过建立民族阵线来“取消政党和集团”的尝试，是同建立民族阵线的真正意愿背道而驰的。所以，如果强行实施这种尝试，它将受到人民的反对，正如人民反对冒险家的行动一样。他说：印度尼西亚的现代史证明了印度尼西亚社会始终是一个阶级社会，不可能取消政党。
    他最后说：所有的道路都通向胜利，不管印度尼西亚人民所将遵循的道路怎样艰巨。进步力量的发展、进步力量同中间力量之间的日益紧密的团结、顽固势力的衰落，这种过程正在继续发展。印度尼西亚共产党的职责所在，是加速这一过程，办法就是更加坚定和积极地执行党的总路线——继续建立民族阵线、继续建党工作，以便彻底完成1945年8月的革命。
    毫无疑问，印度尼西亚政治的发展、印度尼西亚现代史的发展，在很大程度上将取决于这个光辉的总路线。
