Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 19th. Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, issued a statement in Shanghai today, saying that the statement made by Soviet Premier Khrushchev at the preliminary meeting of the Four-Power Summit, and his statement at the press conference before leaving Paris, not only represented the Soviet people, the entire socialist camp, but also the just voice of all peace-loving people in the world. I represent the entire Chinese industrial and commercial circles in expressing warm support and firm backing.

Chen Shutong said that the Soviet Union had made its utmost efforts to convene and successfully hold the Four-Power Summit. However, American imperialism has been deliberately sabotaging it. On the eve of the summit, it sent spy planes to fly like robbers over Soviet airspace, and openly stated that conducting spy flights over other countries was American policy. We express great anger at this thuggish behavior that disrupted the summit.

Chen Shutong said that this shameless act of American imperialism further proves that the aggressive nature of imperialism will not change. Although Eisenhower has recently put on a "peaceful" face, the fox's tail cannot be hidden after all. The truth about who wants peace and who wants war has become clear. American imperialism is destroying the summit under the guise of agreeing to hold it, and destroying peace under the guise of peace.

Chen Shutong said that we warn American imperialism and Eisenhower that deceptive tactics cannot fool the people of the world, and war threats cannot intimidate the people of the world. The powerful Soviet Union and the socialist camp can inflict devastating blows on imperialist madmen who dare to launch a war. In order to shatter the conspiracy of American imperialism to plan a new war, and to defend world peace, we must firmly unite with the Soviet people, with the people of all countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and with all peace-loving people around the world, and fight the imperialist robbers to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, May 20th. Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, today sent a telegram to Fedin, First Secretary of the Board of the Soviet Writers Association, supporting the Soviet government's solemn position on the provocative crimes of American imperialism.

Mao Dun's telegram said: "After the ferocious American robbers dispatched U-2 spy planes to invade Soviet airspace, ignoring the Soviet government's solemn protests and reasonable demands, ignoring the protests and condemnations from the socialist camp and peace-loving people all over the world, disregarding international law, and defying the world, they openly claimed that conducting aggressive spy flights was the established policy of the American government with the naked face and logic of a robber, and brazenly refused to take responsibility for their crimes, refused to make the necessary guarantee that they would not repeat them, and refused to apologize to the Soviet government and people, leading to the final destruction of the Four-Power Summit. The barbaric and unreasonable crimes of the American robbers have aroused the unparalleled anger of our 650 million people."

The telegram said: "The American imperialists, who are addicted to aggression, have never stopped their frenzied arms expansion and war preparations while feigning peace and agreeing to participate in the Four-Power Summit, and have been creating various difficulties and obstacles for the Four-Power Summit, and constantly spreading pessimistic sentiments that the Four-Power Summit is doomed to failure. The fact that the Four-Power Summit was finally destroyed by the American government is by no means accidental. Now, the American robbers are trying to shift the responsibility for destroying the Four-Power Summit to the Soviet government. This trick of reversing black and white is truly shameless to the extreme. We, all Chinese writers, like peace-loving people all over the world, firmly support the solemn position of the Soviet government headed by Comrade Khrushchev."

Mao Dun's telegram said: "We must not tolerate such crimes by the American robbers. We believe that an invasion of the Soviet Union is an invasion of China, and an invasion of the entire socialist camp. If the American robbers are obsessed and do not wake up, they will inevitably suffer the fate of playing with fire and burning themselves.

"Today—May 20th, while a demonstration of three million people against American aggression against the Soviet Union and the destruction of the Four-Power Summit is being held in our capital, Beijing, we especially express our determination and conviction to you—our closest comrades and comrades-in-arms: All Chinese writers pledge to stand with the Soviet writers and the Soviet people and fight to the end to overthrow American imperialism!"

    坚决支持苏联反击美国强盗
    全国工商联主任委员陈叔通发表声明
    中国作家协会主席茅盾致电费定
    新华社上海19日电　中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通今天在上海发表声明说，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在四国首脑会议预备会议上所发表的声明，和他离开巴黎前在记者招待会上的声明，不仅是代表苏联人民、代表整个社会主义阵营，也是代表世界一切爱好和平的人民的正义的声音。我代表全中国工商界表示热烈拥护和坚决支持。
    陈叔通说，为了召开和开好四国首脑会议，苏联曾经尽了最大的努力。但是，美帝国主义却一直蓄意破坏。在首脑会议即将举行的前夕，它派遣间谍飞机去苏联上空作强盗飞行，并公然说在其他国家上空进行间谍飞行是美国的国策。这种强盗行径破坏了首脑会议的召开，我们对此表示极大的愤怒。
    陈叔通说，美帝国主义的这种无耻的勾当，进一步证明了帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的。尽管最近一个时期来，艾森豪威尔扮出一副“和平”的面貌，但狐狸的尾巴终究是藏不住的。谁要和平，谁要战争，已经真相大白。美帝国主义是在同意举行首脑会议的幌子下破坏首脑会议，在和平的幌子下破坏和平。
    陈叔通说，我们警告美帝国主义和艾森豪威尔，用欺骗手段是骗不了世界人民的，用战争威胁也是吓不倒世界人民的。强大的苏联和社会主义阵营，能对敢于发动战争的帝国主义狂人给予毁灭性的打击。为了粉碎美帝国主义策划新战争的阴谋，为了保卫世界和平，我们要坚决地同苏联人民，同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的各国人民，同全世界一切爱好和平的人民，紧紧团结在一起，与帝国主义强盗斗争到底。
    新华社20日讯　中国作家协会主席茅盾今天致电苏联作家协会理事会第一书记费定，支持苏联政府对美帝国主义挑衅罪行所采取的严正立场。
    茅盾的电报说：“穷凶极恶的美国强盗派遣U—2型间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空之后，不顾苏联政府的严正抗议和合理要求，不顾社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平的人民的纷纷抗议和谴责，不顾国际公法，甘冒天下之大不韪，以赤裸裸的强盗的嘴脸和逻辑，公开声称进行侵略性的间谍飞行是美国政府的既定政策，并且悍然拒绝对自己的罪行承担责任，拒绝作出不再重犯的应有保证，拒绝向苏联政府和人民道歉，以致最后破坏了四国首脑会议。美国强盗这种蛮横无理的罪行，激起我国六亿五千万人民的无比愤怒。”
    电报说：“侵略成性的美国帝国主义者，在它伪装和平同意参加四国首脑会议的同时，从来也没有停止疯狂的扩军备战活动，而且一直为四国首脑会议制造种种困难和障碍，不断地散布四国首脑会议注定失败的悲观空气。四国首脑会议终于被美国政府所破坏，这决不是偶然的。现在，美国强盗企图把破坏四国首脑会议的责任转嫁于苏联政府，这种颠倒黑白的伎俩真是无耻到了极点。我们中国全体作家和全世界爱好和平的人民一样，坚决支持以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联政府的严正立场。”
    茅盾的电报说：“我们决不能容忍美国强盗的这种罪行。我们认为：对苏联的侵犯，就是对中国的侵犯，就是对整个社会主义阵营的侵犯。如果美国强盗执迷不悟，一定要遭到玩火自焚的命运。
    “今天—5月20日，在我国首都北京举行三百万人反对美国侵略苏联和破坏四国首脑会议的示威游行的同时，我们特向你们——我们最亲密的同志和战友，表示我们的决心和信念：我国全体作家誓同苏联作家及苏联人民站在一起，为打倒美帝国主义而斗争到底！”
