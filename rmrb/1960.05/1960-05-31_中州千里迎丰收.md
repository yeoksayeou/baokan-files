    Central Plains Reaps Bumper Harvest Across Thousands of Miles
    Written collectively by our correspondent in Henan and correspondents groups from various parts of Henan Province

    The most intense and busiest wheat harvest season of the year has arrived in Henan Province, a major wheat-producing area in China. Across the thousands of miles of the Central Plains, the wheat waves, nearing ripeness, roll in the wind, boundless and endless. This year, the wheat in Henan Province is generally growing well. Whether in the Taihang Mountains or the Funiu Mountains, whether in the plains of northern, eastern, or central Henan, or in the newly reclaimed Yellow River滩地 (tāndì - riverside land), everywhere there is wheat as tall as a person's chest, with large and uniform ears, and everywhere there is a joyous scene of welcoming the harvest. The province's 25 million mu of large-area high-yield plots are connected to each other, the wheat stalks are strong, and the growth is even more gratifying.

    Last autumn, Henan Province sowed wheat under extremely dry conditions, using methods such as irrigation to combat the drought. After sowing, it suffered from winter and spring droughts, with more than seven months of rainfall shortage. South of the Yellow River, it only rained in mid-to-late March this year, and northern Henan is still suffering from severe drought. Then, people will definitely ask: With such severe drought, why is the wheat in Henan Province growing better this year than in the previous two years?

      Bumper Harvest Depends on People, Not Heaven

    On the eve of the harvest, we visited both sides of the Yellow River, climbed the Taihang Mountains and the Funiu Mountains, and we deeply understood that the unusual nature of this year's wheat harvest in Henan lies first and foremost in the greater victory achieved in the fight against drought than last year.

    Lin County in the Taihang Mountains has not had a thorough rain for more than 200 days from last year to this year, but now the wheat has large ears and full grains, each plot surpassing the other. The wheat on the top of the mountains in the Shiban'yan People's Commune is also growing well. Being able to save the wheat on the high mountains in such a severe drought, and to make it grow well, one cannot help but admire the anti-drought perseverance of the Shiban'yan Commune members. This year, during the period when wheat growth requires water, the Shiban'yan Commune specially organized more than 240 water-carrying shock troops for these high-mountain wheat fields that cannot be irrigated, traversing mountains and ridges, running more than 20 *li* to carry water to irrigate the wheat. However, it is impossible to save all the wheat fields in all mountainous areas without irrigation conditions by relying solely on carrying water. For this reason, during this year's drought resistance, people in mountainous areas tried every means to find water sources. In the mass movement to find water, people in the Taihang Mountains, Funiu Mountains, and northern mountainous areas adopted various methods. Some people used magnetic bowls to cover the ground to observe the underground water vapor, and some people went to deep mountain valleys in the middle of the night when everything was silent to listen for water, and finally found many mountain springs. In just half a month, one county in the Taihang Mountains found 217 places, expanding the irrigation area by more than 17,300 *mu*. Song County in the Funiu Mountains also newly built and renovated more than 5,500 canals along the mountains during this year's drought resistance, totaling more than 10,000 *hua li*. A crystal-clear water belt connects thousands of mountains and gullies throughout Song County. The Shantou Commune in Song County established a great ambition and lofty aspirations, intercepted the Yi River, and along the cliffs where "birds dare not stand, and apes are frightened," they chiseled mountains and opened canals. After several months of hard work, they finally built a large canal more than 30 *li* long that crosses more than 50 mountain streams, cuts down seven mountain peaks, fills in 46 gullies, and passes through a 300-meter mountain cave and a 500-meter river bottom culvert, enabling tens of thousands of *mu* of wheat fields to be irrigated.

    Relying Entirely on Double Insurance for Drought Resistance

    In order to eliminate drought forever, the vast plain areas and hilly semi-mountainous areas proposed double insurance of well and canal irrigation, and launched a vigorous movement to drill wells on a large scale. This spring, nearly 100,000 wells were drilled in Henan Province, of which 60,000 to 70,000 have already played a role, ensuring the irrigation of vast wheat fields. Now, in the plains of Xuchang and Nanyang, there is a well every three to five hundred meters, scattered like stars in the boundless wheat sea. Canals crisscross the wheat fields, and the sound of water pumps echoes across the fields. Without these wells to extract groundwater, the wheat in Henan Province would not have grown as well as it is now. A one-million *mu* high-yield area in Nanyang Prefecture, relying on wells, irrigated four times and applied fertilizer four times this spring when the river dried up and the reservoir was dry. Now, these wheat fields have an average of 500,000 to 600,000 ears per *mu*, and there is no trace of drought.

    High-Yield Wheat is Even Better

    This year, the area of high-yield wheat fields in Henan is very large. Tens of thousands of *mu*, hundreds of thousands of *mu*, millions of *mu* of high-yield areas, one large piece after another, stretching as far as the eye can see. These high-yield wheat plants grow as tall, as dense, and the ears are very uniform. This is mainly due to the fact that people have cultivated and cultivated carefully under the same standards in accordance with the requirements of the "Eight-Character Charter" (soil, fertilizer, water, seed, close planting, protection, tool reform, field management). Wheat fields like this were only small test plots in 1958, and the largest was only a 10,000 *mu* high-yield area last year, while this year there are millions of *mu* of high-yield areas, and the area of high-yield areas in the province reaches 25 million *mu*. The bumper harvest of these wheat fields will play a significant role in this year's wheat harvest in Henan Province.

    Yanshi, the famous wheat red banner county, has done a particularly good job in this year's large-area high-yield wheat. Last year, only Dongqizhuang County had a 10,000 *mu* high-yield area, which achieved high yield. This year, the area of high-yield in the county has been expanded to 300,000 *mu*, and with last year's experience, the management of high-yield is more refined and meticulous, truly achieving "a higher level." In the Yue'tan Brigade of the Zhai Town Commune in Yanshi, there is an 800 *mu* wheat field, which is a test field cultivated under the leadership of the famous peasant expert Liu Mingxiang. The wheat stalks are as tall as a person's chest, the wheat stalks are thick, and each ear is three to four inches long, with fifty to sixty grains. The uniformity of the ears far exceeds that of ordinary high-yield fields. It is difficult to see the two or three smaller ears of wheat that are usually found in wheat fields in the 800 *mu*. This wheat grows so well because Liu Mingxiang scientifically controlled the tillering of the wheat during the wheat growing season according to the wheat's growth law, so that the wheat grew completely according to human will. This spring, thousands of people from various regions visited this wheat field, and no one did not envy and praise it.

      Wheat in Low-Yield Areas Exceeds Previous Years

    The good growth of wheat in many past low-yield areas and low-yield fields is a common feature of Henan this year. Miaowan Brigade in Gongshi Commune in Yanshi is like this, and Nanle County is also like this. Miracles have also appeared this year in the sandy areas of eastern Henan, the Yellow River灘地 (tāndì - riverside land), and the Beiman Ridge, where wheat grows particularly uniformly. This is the success of the leadership method of the Party at all levels in Henan Province in grasping both ends and continuously carrying out the leadership method of low-yield catching up with high-yield and eliminating the three types of seedlings.

    Nanle County is a sandy area on the north bank of the Yellow River, and the yield per *mu* of wheat has always been only a few dozen *jin*. Last year, the average yield of the county was only more than 100 *jin*. In order to change the low-yield situation, before wheat sowing last year, Nanle County launched a mass movement to improve the soil. On the basis of the initial improvement of the soil, four 10,000 *mu* high-yield areas were specially established on low-yield fields such as alkaline land and green sandy land. The 2,665 *mu* of saline-alkali slope cliffs in the Wujiatun Brigade of the Gujinlou Commune also entered the high-yield area. The local people call these lands "lands that squander their fortunes," and believe that: "Planting alkali land is suffering in vain, planting eighteen (*jin*) can only harvest fifteen (*jin*)." However, this year, under the leadership of Li Guangyuan, the first secretary of the county party committee, and Yang Diankui, the secretary of the secretariat, the wheat in this land that squandered its fortunes grew densely and the ears were full, which could be compared with the best silty wheat in the local area. Minquan County and Lankao County are sandy areas on the Yellow River滩地 (tāndì - riverside land) in Henan Province. In the past, it was "yellow sand everywhere, no grass grows, and a sandstorm will sweep away all the fertile land." However, after years of afforestation and wind prevention since liberation, the appearance of the river area has gradually changed. In particular, after the great battle on the Yellow River滩地 (tāndì - riverside land) last year, which expanded the wheat sowing area, the appearance of the sandy area has undergone earth-shaking changes. Now, although the 730,000 *mu* of wheat in Minquan County has suffered five giant winds of magnitude 9, not a single *mu* has been swallowed by the yellow sand, and not a single *mu* has grown poorly. The wheat in Lankao County also grows better than in any previous year.

    Now, the wheat in the southern part of Henan Province is gradually ripening, and the tense harvest season has arrived. The people of Henan are anxiously guarding against any possible disasters such as wind, hail, and rainstorms before the harvest, and are waiting to harvest the fruits of their hard work.

    中州千里迎丰收
    本报驻河南记者  河南省各地通讯组集体采写
    我国主要产麦区河南省一年一度最紧张、最繁忙的麦收季节到来了。千里中州，接近黄熟的麦浪迎风翻腾，无涯无际。今年，河南省的小麦普遍生长良好，不论是太行山区或伏牛山区，不论是豫北、豫东、豫中平原，也不论是新开垦的黄河滩地，到处是齐胸的小麦，穗大整齐，到处是一片喜气洋洋的迎接丰收的景象。全省二千五百万亩大面积的丰产方，方方相连，麦株茁壮，长得更是喜人。
    河南省去年秋天是在极端缺墒的情况下，采用浇水等等办法抗旱种麦的。种后又遭到冬旱和春旱，七个多月缺雨。黄河以南今年3月中下旬才下了雨，豫北地区到现在还在苦旱。那么，人们一定会问：这样苦旱，为什么今年河南省的小麦长得比前两年更好？
      丰收在人不在天
    丰收前夕，我们访问了黄河两岸，攀登了太行山和伏牛山，我们深深理解到：今年河南麦收不平凡，首先就在于抗旱斗争取得了比去年更大的胜利。
    太行山区的林县，从去年到今年有两百多天没有下过透雨，现在麦子却穗大籽饱，一块赛过一块，石板岩人民公社高山顶上的小麦同样长得很好。这样大旱，能够把高山上的小麦救下来，而且长的好，这不能不佩服石板岩公社社员的抗旱毅力。今年在小麦生长需水时期，石板岩公社特别为这些高山无法浇灌的麦田组织了二百四十多名担水突击队，翻山越岭，跑二十多里路，担水浇麦。但是，所有山区没有灌溉条件的麦田，光靠担水是无法全部救活的。为此，今年抗旱中间，山区的人们千方百计地寻找水源。在群众性的找水运动中，太行山区、伏牛山区、北部山区各地，人们采取了各种各样的办法。有的人用磁碗盖在地上观察地下水的蒸气，有些人在半夜三更万籁无声的时候到深山峡谷里去听水，终于找到了很多山泉。仅太行山的一个县在半个月内就找到了二百一十七处，扩大灌溉面积一万七千三百多亩。伏牛山区的嵩县，在今年抗旱中还沿山新修和整修了渠道五千五百多条，长达一万多华里。一条晶莹的水带把嵩县全县千千万万个山头、山沟都串连起来了。嵩县澶头公社树雄心、立大志，拦截伊河，沿着“飞鸟不敢站，猿猴心胆寒”的悬崖峭壁，凿山开渠，经过几个月的苦战，终于修成了一条跨越五十多个山涧、削平七个山头、填平四十六条沟、穿过三百米的山洞和五百米的河底涵洞，长达三十多里的大渠，使几万亩麦田获得了灌溉。
    抗旱全靠双保险
    广大平原地区和丘陵半山区，为了永远消灭干旱，提出了井渠灌溉双保险，开展了轰轰烈烈大打机井的运动。今年春天，河南全省共打机井近十万眼，其中已经发挥作用的有六、七万眼，保证了广大麦田的灌溉。现在，在许昌、南阳一带平原上，每隔三、五百米就有一眼机井，星罗棋布地散布在浩瀚无边的麦海里。麦地里渠道纵横，抽水机哒哒的声音响彻了原野。要没有这些机井取出地下水来，今年河南省的小麦就不可能长得像现在这样好。南阳专区的一个一百万亩的丰产方，今年春天在河干水库涸的情况下，依靠机井前后浇了四次水，同时追施了四次肥，现在这些麦田平均每亩都有五、六十万穗，根本看不出一丝受过旱灾的痕迹。
    丰产方小麦好上好
    今年河南小麦丰产田的面积很大。成万亩、几万亩、十万亩、几十万亩、成百万亩的丰产方，一大片连一大片，望不到边。这些丰产麦长得一样高大，一样稠密，穗头十分整齐。这主要是由于人们按照“八字宪法”的要求，在同一标准下精耕细作的结果。像这样的麦田，1958年只有小块试验田，去年最大的也只有万亩丰产方，而今年有成百万亩的丰产方，全省丰产方的面积共达二千五百万亩。这些麦田的丰收对今年河南全省小麦丰收起重大作用。
    著名的小麦红旗县——偃师，今年的小麦大面积丰产方搞的特别好。去年，这个县只有东奇庄一个万亩丰产方，获得了高产。今年全县丰产方面积扩大到三十万亩，而且有去年的经验，丰产方管理得更精更细，真正做到了“更上一层楼”。偃师翟镇公社岳滩大队有一块八百亩大的小麦，是著名的农民专家刘名祥领导培植的试验田。齐胸的麦棵，粗粗的麦秆，每个穗子都有三、四寸长，五、六十个籽。穗头整齐的程度远远超过一般丰产田，八百亩中很难看到通常麦田所有的二、三棚较小的穗头。这片小麦长得这样好，是由于刘名祥根据小麦的生长规律，在小麦生长期中科学地控制了小麦的分蘖，使小麦完全按照人的意志生长的结果。今年春天来自各个地区的，成千上万的人参观过这片小麦，没有一个参观者不羡慕，不称赞。
      低产区小麦胜往年
    许多过去的低产区、低产田小麦生长得也很好，是今年河南的普遍特点。偃师缑氏公社苗湾大队是这样，南乐县也是这样。豫东沙区、黄河滩地、北邙岭上今年也出现奇迹，小麦长得格外整齐。这是河南省各级党今年大抓两头，不断开展低产赶高产、消灭三类苗的领导方法的成功。
    南乐县是黄河北岸的沙区，历来小麦的亩产量只有几十斤，去年全县平均也只有一百多斤。为了改变低产面貌，去年麦播以前，南乐全县发动了一个群众性的改良土壤运动。在土壤初步改良的基础上，特别在碱地、青沙地等低产田上建立了四个万亩丰产方。谷金楼公社吴家屯大队的二千六百六十五亩盐碱坡崖地也进了丰产方。这些地当地群众称为“败家子地”，认为：“种碱地是白受苦，种十八（斤）只能收十五斤”。可是这块败家子地今年在县委第一书记李光远和书记处书记杨殿魁领导下，小麦却长得挤挤密密，穗穗饱满，可以同当地最好的淤地小麦平起平坐。民权县和兰考县是河南省黄河滩上的沙区。过去，在这里是“黄沙漠漠，寸草不生，一场风沙，良田尽倾”。但是，经过解放后几年来的造林防风，已逐步改变了河区面貌，特别是去年大战黄河滩，扩大了小麦播种面积以后，沙区面貌更是起了翻天复地的变化。现在民权县的七十三万亩小麦，虽然前后遭受了五场九级巨风，却没有一亩被黄沙吞没，也没有一亩长得不好。兰考县的小麦同样也长得比以往任何一年都好。
          ×　×　×
    现在，河南省南部地区小麦已经逐渐黄熟，紧张的收获季节来到了。河南人民正怀着一颗跳动不安的心，警惕着收割前任何可能发生的风、雹、暴雨等灾害，等待着收获辛勤劳动的果实。
