Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 6th: The largest water conservancy project in Jiangxi Province's history – the Ganfu Plain Comprehensive Development Water Conservancy Project – was fully completed on April 29th, two years ahead of schedule, and water was immediately released to meet the needs of early rice transplanting.

The Ganfu Plain Comprehensive Development Water Conservancy Project integrates flood control, drainage, and irrigation of farmland, and also develops navigation, power generation, and fish farming. The total amount of earth and stone work is 35 million cubic meters. The entire water conservancy system is spread over more than 4,000 square kilometers of the Ganfu Plain. 1,296 large, medium, and small engineering structures control more than 500 large and small irrigation canals with a total length of more than 1,500 kilometers. This project has been fully utilized since its completion, enabling the 3 million mu of farmland on the Ganfu Plain to realize water conservancy and self-flowing irrigation during the urgently needed rice transplanting season. Among them, 700,000 mu of farmland have basically gotten rid of the historical threat of severe waterlogging. The entire Ganfu Plain can save more than 12 million drought resistance and flood control labor days each year as a result, and can also promote "three transformations" of increasing production measures, such as changing from one crop to two crops a year, changing dry land to paddy fields, and changing barren land to cultivated land. With this water conservancy project, the Ganfu Plain can increase its grain harvest by 500 to 600 million jin per year from rice production alone.

This comprehensive development water conservancy project began construction on May 1, 1958, and was originally scheduled to be completed in May 1962. After two years of hard work by 100,000 water conservancy builders, it was victoriously completed on April 29th of this year, two years ahead of schedule, saving the state more than 20 million yuan in expenses.

The completion of the Ganfu Plain Comprehensive Development Water Conservancy Project can not only basically eliminate water and drought disasters in the upper and lower reaches of the Fu River, but also increase cultivated land. In terms of navigation, the main canal, branch canal, sub-branch canal, and drainage channel can also be fully utilized for navigation and transportation, forming a navigation network; the voyage of Fu River ships to Nanchang City is also more than 100 kilometers shorter than in the past. The Ganfu Plain was prone to waterlogging and drought in the past, and many ponds, reservoirs, and lakes could not be used for fish farming. Now the area of fish farming can reach more than 500,000 mu. Not only that, but hydropower stations can also be built using the irrigation and drainage channel drops to provide cheap power to the countryside.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: The six large reservoirs built in the Lin Yi District of Shandong Province last year have now successfully completed their main canal projects, enabling the reservoirs to play a huge role in drought resistance.

The six reservoir main canal projects started in November last year. Up to now, more than 2,000 li of main, branch, and feeder canals have been built. Together with the farm and capillary canals, the total length reaches 10,000 li, with more than 5,200 large-scale buildings.

The main canals of the six reservoirs are distributed from the southern foothills of the Yimeng Mountains to the Yellow Sea Bay, and from Xiaoshiyang in Juxian County to the plain of Tancheng in the northeast, passing through six counties and dozens of people's communes, turning nearly 300 li of 2 million mu of dry land into irrigated land. At the same time, more than 30 hydropower stations and power stations have been built or are under construction on these long canals. The construction of the six reservoir canal projects was entirely dependent on the strength of the communes, and was completed by adopting methods such as self-production, self-repair, substitution, cooperation, and economy.

After the completion of the main canals of the six reservoirs, they immediately played a huge role in drought resistance for wheat irrigation and drought resistance for spring sowing. According to incomplete statistics, 600,000 mu of wheat have been irrigated twice.

### 既能防洪排涝灌溉农田　又能发展航运发电养鱼  赣抚平原综合水利工程提前两年竣工  山东临沂专区六大水库在抗旱中发挥巨大作用

    既能防洪排涝灌溉农田　又能发展航运发电养鱼
    赣抚平原综合水利工程提前两年竣工
    山东临沂专区六大水库在抗旱中发挥巨大作用
    据新华社南昌6日电　江西省有历史以来兴建的最大一项水利工程——赣抚平原综合开发水利工程，比原计划提前两年在4月29日全部竣工，并且立即放水，供应早稻插秧需要。
    赣抚平原综合开发水利工程既可以防洪、排涝、灌溉农田，又可以发展航运、发电、养鱼。土石方工程总量共三千五百万立方米。整个水利系统遍布于四千多平方公里的赣抚平原。一千二百九十六座大中小型工程建筑物，控制着大小五百多条总长达一千五百多公里的灌溉渠道。这一工程自竣工之日起已全部开始利用，使赣抚平原上的三百万亩农田正当急需用水的插秧季节实现水利化，灌溉自流化。其中还有七十万亩农田，基本上摆脱了历史性的严重涝灾威胁。整个赣抚平原，每年可因此节约抗旱、防洪劳动力一千二百多万个，并可大量推行一季变双季、旱地变水田、荒田变熟地等“三变”的增产措施。有了这个水利工程，赣抚平原仅发展水稻生产一项，每年就可以增收粮食五亿到六亿斤。
    这个综合开发水利工程是1958年5月1日破土动工的，原计划在1962年5月建成，经过十万水利建设者的两年奋战，在今年4月29日比原计划提前两年全部胜利竣工，并为国家节省了两千多万元经费。
    赣抚平原综合开发水利工程的建成，不仅抚河上下游水旱灾害可以基本消除，而且可以增垦耕地。在航运方面，也可以充分利用总干渠、干渠、分干渠、排渍道通航运输，构成了一个航运网；抚河船只到南昌市的航程，也比过去缩短一百多公里。赣抚平原过去易涝易旱，许多池塘、水库、湖泊不能养鱼，现在养鱼水面可达五十万亩以上。不仅如此，利用灌溉、排渍渠道跌水还可以兴建水电站，为农村提供廉价的动力。
    新华社济南电　山东省临沂专区去年建成的六个大水库，现在干渠工程又胜利竣工，使水库在抗旱中发挥了巨大作用。
    这六个水库干渠工程是在去年11月间开始的，到目前止，已修建干、支、斗渠两千多华里，加上农、毛渠道，达万里之长，较大型建筑物五千二百多座。
    六个水库的干渠分布在沂蒙山南麓到黄海湾，和东北部莒县的小仕阳到郯城平原之间，穿过六个县和数十个人民公社，把方圆近三百华里的二百万亩旱地，变为水浇田。同时在这些长渠上，还修起或正在修建水力动力站、发电站三十多处。这六个水库渠道工程的修建，全部依靠公社力量，采取自产、自修、代用、协作、节约等办法修成的。
    六个水库的干渠修成后，立即在抗旱浇麦和抗旱春播中发挥了巨大作用，据不完全统计，已有六十万亩小麦浇水两遍。
