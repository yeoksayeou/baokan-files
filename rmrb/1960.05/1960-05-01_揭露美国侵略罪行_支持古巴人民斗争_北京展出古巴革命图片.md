    To expose U.S. aggression crimes and support the Cuban people's struggle, the China-Latin America Friendship Association and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions held the opening ceremony of the "Cuban Revolution Photo Exhibition" at the Art Hall of the Working People's Cultural Palace this morning.
    Chu Tunan, President of the China-Latin America Friendship Association, delivered the opening speech at the meeting. He expressed the highest respect on behalf of the China-Latin America Friendship Association to the heroic Cuban people. He said that the Cuban people's firm will and heroic spirit in opposing U.S. imperialism is a shining example for the Latin American people in opposing U.S. imperialist aggression, and has won the respect of people all over the world. The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the Cuban people. The unity, cooperation and mutual support between our two peoples in the common struggle cannot be destroyed by any force. Then, Rogelio Iglesias Batino, representative of the Cuban Workers' Federation, spoke in warm applause. He first thanked the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the China-Latin America Friendship Association for holding this photo exhibition. He then introduced the crimes of U.S. imperialism bombing Cuban cities, the Batista dictatorial army's brutal suppression, torture, and killing of 20,000 people in the photos. He said that this is the peace that U.S. imperialism promotes and claims to want to maintain.
    Iglesias said that in these photos, you can also see that Cuban workers, farmers, university students and all the Cuban people are organized into militias, ready to defend our revolution in any way necessary. He emphasized that in the face of every new attempt by U.S. imperialism to besiege and isolate us, the people of the world will more firmly support our revolution.
    After Liu Changsheng, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, cut the ribbon, Chinese and foreign guests attending the opening ceremony carefully viewed the exhibited photos. These vivid photos aroused great sympathy among the attendees, who unanimously expressed their support for the Cuban revolution. It particularly aroused strong feelings among friends from Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting against imperialism and colonialism. Shinhachi Hagiwara, head of the delegation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan visiting China, told reporters that the Japanese people are currently engaged in the struggle to prevent the passage of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and the Cuban people's struggle has boosted the confidence of the Japanese people's struggle.
    Fales Ben Mehar, head of the delegation of the General Union of Algerian Workers, said: "When I see these photos, I think of the brutal suppression suffered by the Cuban people under dictatorial rulers, just like the Algerian people." He said that U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, says it maintains peace and does not support French colonialism, but on the other hand, it uses weapons to help French colonialists strengthen their persecution and attacks on the Algerian people. U.S. imperialism is not only the enemy of the Cuban people, but also the enemy of the Algerian people.
    Edward-Jerome Bokuedangi, a member of the delegation of the General Confederation of Workers of the Congo, said that whether it is Belgium, France, Britain or the United States, all the imperialists and colonialists in the world are the same, they ferociously enslave the people and massacre the people. The Congolese people fully support the Cuban people's struggle against U.S. imperialism. Carlos Telles da Cunha e Mello, head of the delegation of the National Confederation of Public Servants of Brazil and the National Federation of Bank Employees of Brazil, said: "The Cuban people support the Cuban government, and a regime supported by the people will always win. The Brazilian people will always support the Cuban people's revolution."
    Attending the opening ceremony were friends from Asia, Africa, Latin America and other countries who were invited to visit China and participate in the celebration of the "May Day" International Labor Day, as well as people from all walks of life in the capital, totaling more than 500 people.

    揭露美国侵略罪行　支持古巴人民斗争
    北京展出古巴革命图片
    新华社30日讯　中国拉丁美洲友好协会、中华全国总工会，今天上午在劳动人民文化宫艺术厅举行“古巴革命图片展览”开幕式。
    中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南在会上致开幕词。他代表中国拉丁美洲友好协会向英勇战斗的古巴人民致以最崇高的敬意。他说，古巴人民反对美帝国主义的坚定意志和英雄气概是拉丁美洲人民反对美帝国主义侵略的光辉的榜样，赢得了全世界人民的尊敬。中国人民坚决支持古巴人民的正义斗争。我们两国人民在共同斗争中的团结合作和相互支援是任何力量也摧毁不了的。接着，古巴工人联合会代表洛赫里奥·伊格莱西亚斯·巴蒂诺在热烈掌声中讲话。他首先感谢中华全国总工会和中国拉丁美洲友好协会举行这个图片展览会。接着介绍了图片中美帝国主义轰炸古巴城市、巴蒂斯塔独裁军队残酷镇压、严刑拷打和杀害两万人民等罪行。他说，这就是美帝国主义所宣传和声称要加以维护的和平。
    伊格莱西亚斯说，在这些图片里，你们还可以看到古巴的工人、农民、大学生和全体古巴人民都组织成民兵，准备用必要的方式来保卫我们的革命。他强调指出，在美帝国主义每一次包围我们和孤立我们的新的企图的面前，全世界的人民将会更坚决的支持我们的革命。
    中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜剪彩后，出席开幕式的中外人士仔细观看了展出的图片。这些生动的图片引起了到会者极大的同情，一致表示支持古巴革命。特别激起了正在和帝国主义、殖民主义进行斗争的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的朋友们的强烈感情。日本总评访华代表团团长萩原信治对记者说，目前日本人民正在进行阻止通过日美“安全条约”的斗争，古巴人民的斗争鼓舞了日本人民的斗争信心。
    阿尔及利亚工人总联合会代表团团长法莱斯·本·梅哈尔说：“当我看到这些图片，我就想到古巴人民所遭受独裁统治者的残酷镇压也和阿尔及利亚人民一样。”他说，美帝国主义一方面说，维护和平，不支持法国殖民主义者，可是另一方面却用武器来帮助法国殖民主义者加强对阿尔及利亚人民的迫害和进攻。美帝国主义不仅是古巴人民的敌人，也是阿尔及利亚人民的敌人。
    刚果全国工人联合会代表团团员爱德华—季罗姆·博奎丹吉说，不管是比利时、法国、英国或者是美国，全世界的帝国主义者、殖民主义者都是一样，他们凶恶地奴役人民、屠杀人民。刚果人民全力支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。巴西全国公务员工会和巴西全国银行职员联合会代表团团长卡洛斯·泰勒·达·库尼亚·埃·梅洛说：“古巴人民是支持古巴政府的，为人民所支持的政权是永远会胜利的。巴西人民永远支持古巴人民的革命。”
    出席开幕式的，有应邀来我国访问和参加庆祝“五一”国际劳动节的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和其他国家的朋友们，以及首都各界人士共五百多人。
