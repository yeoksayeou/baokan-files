The Wu Lou Brigade of the Chengguan People's Commune in Zhecheng County, Henan Province, has created a method of steam incubation for chickens. All seven mess units in the brigade are using steam from cooking to incubate chickens.

This method of incubation is based on the principle of the heated kang incubation method. A kang is built next to the coal stove, measuring 120 cm long, 100 cm wide, and 110 cm high, utilizing the temperature of the coal fire and steam to incubate the chickens. During incubation, the eggs are placed in basins lined with wheat straw inside the kang, covered with a layer of cotton to maintain the temperature. The door of the kang is blocked with bricks. Depending on changes in air temperature, the kang door is either tightly sealed or left open to adjust the internal temperature. To ensure the temperature of the eggs is uniform and to prevent the germinal disc from sticking to the eggshell, the eggs need to be turned three or four times a day.

This type of steam incubation kang can generally incubate 200 eggs. Because it utilizes the residual heat from the coal fire and steam, the cost is very low. (Welfare Department of the Zhecheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party)

   蒸汽孵鸡成本低
    河南省柘城县城关人民公社吴楼大队，创造了蒸汽孵鸡法，全大队七个伙食单位都利用做饭用的蒸汽孵鸡。
    这种孵鸡方法是根据火炕孵鸡法的原理，在煤火炉旁搭一个长一百二十厘米，宽一百厘米，高一百一十厘米的炕，利用煤火的温度和蒸汽的温度孵鸡。孵鸡时，把蛋放在炕内，铺着麦秸的盆子里，盖一层棉花以保持温度。炕的门用砖堵住。根据气温的变化，或堵紧或开放调节炕内温度。为了使鸡蛋的温度均匀一致，防止胚盘粘到蛋壳上，每天需要翻蛋三、四次。
    这种蒸汽孵卵炕一般可孵蛋二百个。因为是利用煤火和蒸汽的余热，所以成本很低。（中共柘城县委福利部）
