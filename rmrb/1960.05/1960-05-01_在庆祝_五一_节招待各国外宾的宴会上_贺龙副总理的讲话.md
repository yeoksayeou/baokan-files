Distinguished guests from various countries, dear comrades and friends:

On the eve of the "May Day" International Labor Day, we are very pleased to be able to celebrate this great festival together with more than 700 friends from more than 60 countries. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I extend a warm welcome to you.

As we celebrate the first International Labor Day of the 1960s, we are pleased to see that the cause of liberation of the working people and oppressed nations around the world, and the cause of the people of the world to strive for and defend world peace, have made great progress. A beautiful and bright scene is now unfolding before us.

Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are working with great enthusiasm and creative labor to fulfill and overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan and to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. While further consolidating and developing the rural people's communes, various parts of our country are vigorously developing urban people's communes. Our people are launching a magnificent movement of technical innovation and technical revolution. A vigorous cultural revolution and educational revolution are being carried out in all cities and vast rural areas of our country. All this provides a reliable guarantee for the sustained leap forward of the national economy and the rapid improvement of the communist consciousness and scientific and cultural level of the masses.

On a global scale, the socialist countries where working people are the masters of the country are unprecedentedly strong, and their unity is becoming increasingly consolidated. The working people of all countries are carrying out extensive and in-depth struggles for democracy, the right to survival, and socialism. The storm of national democratic movements of oppressed nations has swept across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The people of the world have waged unremitting struggles against the war schemes of imperialism. All this has severely hit the imperialist aggressive camp headed by the United States, greatly weakened their strength, deepened their contradictions and crises, and accelerated their process towards final demise.

The closer imperialism gets to its death, the more it will make a desperate struggle. They are doing everything possible to undermine the efforts of socialist countries to ease the international situation, continue to frantically expand their armaments and prepare for war, and create obstacles to East-West talks. However, no matter what tricks US imperialism plays, it can only arouse increasingly widespread and fierce resistance and struggle from the people of the world. We are pleased to see that recently, the struggles against imperialism and colonialism in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have continued to reach new heights and have achieved a series of victories. In Asia, the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people is like a volcanic eruption. It has overthrown the traitorous dictator Syngman Rhee, is destroying the puppet regime of the Syngman Rhee clique, and is shaking the colonial rule of US imperialism in South Korea and the Far East. The struggle of millions of Japanese people against the Japan-US military alliance treaty is advancing wave after wave, forcing the Nobusuke Kishi reactionary clique to postpone the ratification of the treaty. The people of Indochina are waging unremitting struggles against US imperialist aggression and expansion, undermining the Geneva Accords and creating tension. In western Asia, the Turkish people have launched a heroic struggle against the Menderes reign of terror. The entire Africa is undergoing a profound and tremendous historical change. The national independence movement, which was still being carried out in some local areas a few years ago, has now swept across the entire African continent. From Algeria to the Union of South Africa and from Cameroon to Kenya, the awakened African people are waging unyielding struggles against the colonialists in various forms. In particular, the heroic Algerian people, who have been engaged in armed struggle against imperialism, have set a clear banner for the African people's struggle for liberation. The widely and deeply developing national democratic struggle in Latin America is constantly dealing heavy blows to US imperialism. The Cuban people have constantly crushed the interference and sabotage of US imperialism and defended the fruits of the revolution. The Venezuelan people recently defeated once again the subversive and destructive activities jointly manufactured by US imperialism and the domestic reactionaries. The entire Latin America is no longer a reliable rear area for US imperialism. All this shows that the victorious development of the world's people's anti-imperialist struggle is inevitable and cannot be stopped by any force. The Chinese people have always regarded the patriotic and just struggles of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries as an inseparable part of the world's people's movement to defend peace, as our own struggle, and give it firm support.

The Chinese government and the Chinese people have always spared no effort to consolidate and strengthen friendly unity with the people of all countries, especially the friendly unity with the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese government and the Chinese people have always followed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit to develop friendly relations with Asian, African, and Latin American countries. Premier Zhou Enlai's recent friendly visits to Burma and Nepal have achieved great success. Following the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between China and Burma, a Treaty of Peace and Friendship has also been signed between China and Nepal. This is a new victory for China's consistent diplomatic policy of adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Premier Zhou Enlai's talks with Prime Minister Nehru have also greatly helped the Indian people understand the Chinese government's friendly attitude towards India and its sincerity in resolving border disputes reasonably, thereby enhancing the great friendship between the Chinese and Indian people.

The current international situation is unprecedentedly favorable to the cause of peace, democracy, national liberation, and socialism. As long as the people of the world further strengthen their unity and continue to struggle, we will surely win greater victories!

Comrades and friends, let us

    For world peace,
    For the prosperity and strength of the socialist camp,
    For the victory of the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America,
    For the unity of the working people of the world,
    For the unity and friendship of all peace-loving countries and peoples,
    To the health of the distinguished guests and friends from all countries participating in this reception,

Cheers!

    在庆祝“五一”节招待各国外宾的宴会上
    贺龙副总理的讲话尊敬的各国贵宾们，亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    在“五一”国际劳动节的前夕，我们十分高兴能够同来自六十多个国家的七百多位朋友在这里共同庆祝这个伟大的节日。我代表中国政府和中国人民向你们表示热烈的欢迎。
    在庆祝六十年代第一个国际劳动节的时候，我们高兴地看到，全世界劳动人民和被压迫民族的解放事业，全世界人民争取和保卫世界和平的事业，有了巨大的发展。现在，展现在我们面前的是一片美好、光明的景象。
    中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，正以高度的热情和创造性的劳动，为完成和超额完成1960年的国民经济计划，为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗。我国各地在进一步巩固和发展农村人民公社的同时，正在大办城市人民公社。我国人民正在掀起一个波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动。我国所有城市和广大农村正在开展蓬蓬勃勃的文化革命和教育革命。所有这一切，对国民经济的持续跃进，对人民群众共产主义觉悟和科学文化水平的迅速提高，提供了可靠的保证。
    在全世界范围内，劳动人民成为国家主人的社会主义各国空前强大，他们之间的团结日益巩固，各国劳动人民正在为争取民主、生存权利和社会主义进行着广泛深入的斗争。被压迫民族的民族民主运动风暴席卷了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲。全世界人民为反对帝国主义的战争阴谋进行了坚持不懈的斗争。所有这一切，沉重地打击了以美国为首的帝国主义侵略阵营，大大地削弱了它们的力量，加深了它们的矛盾和危机，加速了它们走向最后死亡的过程。
    帝国主义越是临近死亡，就越要作垂死的挣扎。它们竭力破坏社会主义各国和缓国际局势的努力，继续疯狂地扩军备战，为东西方会谈制造障碍。但是，不管美帝国主义施展什么伎俩，它只能激起全世界人民越来越广泛、越来越猛烈的反抗和斗争。我们高兴地看到，最近以来亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的斗争不断出现新的高涨，并且取得了一系列的胜利。在亚洲，南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争，有如火山爆发，它已经打倒了卖国贼独裁者李承晚，正在摧毁着李承晚集团的傀儡政权，震撼着美帝国主义在南朝鲜和远东的殖民统治。日本千百万人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争一浪高过一浪地向前推进，迫使岸信介反动集团不得不推迟对这个条约的批准。印度支那各国人民，为反对美帝国主义侵略扩张、破坏日内瓦协议和制造紧张局势，进行着坚持不懈的斗争。在亚洲的西部，土耳其人民已经发动了反对曼德列斯恐怖统治的英勇斗争。整个非洲正在经历着一个深刻的巨大的历史变化。几年前还是在局部地区开展着的民族独立运动，现在已经席卷了整个非洲大陆。从阿尔及利亚到南非联邦，从喀麦隆到怯尼亚，觉醒了的非洲人民以各种形式同殖民主义者进行着不屈不挠的斗争。特别是一直同帝国主义进行着武装斗争的英勇的阿尔及利亚人民，为非洲人民争取解放的斗争，树立了鲜明的旗帜。在拉丁美洲广泛深入发展着的民族民主斗争，不断给予美帝国主义以沉重的打击。古巴人民不断粉碎了美帝国主义的干涉和破坏，保卫了革命的成果。委内瑞拉人民最近又一次击败了美帝国主义和本国反动派共同制造的颠复破坏活动。整个拉丁美洲，再也不是美帝国主义的什么可靠的后方了。所有这一切都表明，世界人民的反帝国主义斗争的胜利发展是不可避免的，是任何力量所不能阻止的。中国人民一向把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的爱国正义斗争，看作是全世界人民保卫和平运动中不可分的一部分，看作是我们自己的斗争，并且给予坚决的支持。
    中国政府和中国人民一贯不遗余力地巩固和加强同各国人民的友好团结，首先是同以苏联为首的社会主义各国的友好团结。中国政府和中国人民一向遵循和平共处五项原则和万隆精神，同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国发展友好关系。最近周恩来总理对缅甸和尼泊尔的友好访问获得了巨大的成功，继中缅签订友好和互不侵犯条约之后中尼也已经签订了和平友好条约。这是中国一贯坚持的和平友好五项原则的外交政策的新胜利。周恩来总理同尼赫鲁总理的会谈，也大大有助于印度人民了解中国政府对印度的友好态度和合理解决边界争端的诚意，从而增进了中印两国人民的伟大友谊。
    目前国际形势对于和平、民主、民族解放和社会主义事业空前有利，只要全世界人民进一步加强团结，再接再厉地进行斗争，我们就一定会赢得更大的胜利！
    同志们，朋友们，让我们
    为世界和平，
    为社会主义阵营的繁荣强盛，
    为亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族解放运动的胜利，
    为全世界劳动人民的团结，
    为一切爱好和平的国家和各国人民的团结和友谊，
    为参加这个招待会的各国贵宾们和朋友们的健康，
    干杯！
