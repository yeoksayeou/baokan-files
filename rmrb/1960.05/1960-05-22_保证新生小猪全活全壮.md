    Ensure All Newborn Piglets Live and Thrive
    During May and June this year, tens of millions of piglets will be born across the country. This marks the high-speed development of China's pig-raising industry and is the result of the tireless efforts of millions of feeding and management personnel.
    Before liberation, the highest number of pigs in stock in China was just over 70 million. This year, the number of piglets born in two months may reach or approach this figure. Producing so many piglets in two months is a product of the great power unleashed by the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.
    Now, the broad masses of cadres and commune members have an increasingly profound understanding of the mutually promoting relationship between the pig-raising industry and agriculture. This year, pig farms have been established everywhere, forming a professional pig-raising force of nearly ten million people, planting tens of millions of mu of feed crops, and launching a mass pig-breeding campaign. Therefore, in May and June, tens of millions of piglets will be produced. Now, the pig-raising professional teams in various places are rolling up their sleeves, ready to deliver this large batch of piglets and lay a solid foundation for the continued leap forward of the pig-raising industry this year.
    Can we guarantee that this large batch of piglets will all be born alive, survive, and thrive? This question must be answered with complete certainty. Some people believe that with a large number of piglets being born, it is inevitable that some will die, and it is impossible to guarantee that all will survive, let alone thrive. This is a reflection of the outdated concepts of the small-scale peasant economy. In the era of the small-scale peasant economy, a farming family raised one or two pigs, and due to the limitations of manpower, materials, and financial resources, it was impossible to establish a scientific management system, to prevent and eliminate pig diseases, or to strengthen the nutrition and care of sows. After the piglets were born, they were weak and prone to disease, and death was unavoidable. Now, our pig-raising industry is a socialist large economy based on collective feeding. Relying on the strong power of the People's Communes and implementing scientific feeding management, it is entirely possible to maximize the survival rate of piglets.
    To ensure that this large batch of piglets all lives and thrives, the most important thing is to properly solve the feed problem. Piglets and lactating sows must eat well and require a certain amount of concentrated feed. People may have two different attitudes towards the feed problem: one is to wait for support from higher authorities; the other is to concentrate the wisdom of the masses and take various measures to solve the feed problem self-reliantly with the spirit of "poor sticks." Countless experiences have proven that as long as we establish the ambition to develop the pig-raising industry at a high speed and fully mobilize the broad masses to find solutions, the feed problem can be solved. China is a large agricultural country with exceptionally abundant agricultural products, and various crops can be planted in many areas throughout the year. As long as we continue to implement the policy of "mainly relying on green and coarse feed, with appropriate matching of concentrated feed," and follow the principle of "relying on the mountains to eat the mountains, relying on the water to eat the water," implementing planting, collection, and processing simultaneously, the feed problem can be solved. As for concentrated feed, this year, nineteen provinces and cities, including Guangdong, Anhui, Hunan, Liaoning, Sichuan, and Shaanxi, have allocated 45 million mu of feed land and adopted methods such as intercropping and crop rotation to plant many high-yield feed crops. If we manage these feed lands carefully, we can harvest a large batch of feed, including some concentrated feed, in May and June. Various localities can also seize the season and make use of field edges, house fronts and backs, barren slopes, and gaps to greatly increase the planting of melons, beans, and vegetables to solve the feed problem during the period of scarcity.
    Solving the feed problem requires long-term planning and short-term arrangements. We must calculate both the overall account of the feed needed for the year and the detailed account of the feed needed for each period. For example, the leading departments of the animal husbandry front should know in their hearts how many sows are pregnant, how many piglets are likely to be born, how many may be born in May and June, how much green and coarse feed is needed, and how much concentrated feed is needed, and plan by category and by month, implement them at all levels, plan production, and plan supply.
    If the feed problem is solved, feeding management must keep up. Experience in many places shows that with the same amount of feed, the survival rate of piglets varies greatly depending on the quality of feeding management. First of all, the sows must be raised well. Healthy sows with sufficient milk can feed the piglets well and enhance the piglets' physique and disease resistance. The time when piglets are weaned and switch to eating feed is a critical point in whether piglets can survive. If the combination of concentrated and coarse feed is not good, the piglets will have indigestion and are prone to disease and death. Therefore, supplementary feed should be added early to enhance the piglets' digestive ability; separate pen feeding and group management should be implemented; and epidemic prevention work should be strengthened to reduce the chances of piglets getting sick.
    The successful completion of this year's pig-raising plan hinges on a great effort in May and June. We must be determined to resolutely fight the battle of welcoming the birth of a large number of piglets. We must achieve a complete victory for the pig-raising industry in the first half of this year!

### 保证新生小猪全活全壮

    保证新生小猪全活全壮
    今年5、6月间，全国各省、区将有几千万头小猪出生。这是我国养猪事业高速度发展的标志，是千千万万饲养管理人员日夜辛勤劳动的结晶。
    在解放以前，我国生猪最高存栏数不过七千多万头。而今年两个月内将要出生的小猪，就可能达到或近于这个数字。两个月生产这么多小猪，这是总路线，大跃进，人民公社发挥出来的巨大威力的产物。
    现在，广大干部和社员对于养猪业和农业互相促进的关系认识得越来越深刻了。今年全国各地大办猪场，组成了近千万人的养猪专业队伍，种植了几千万亩饲料，开展了群众性的配种运动，因此，在5、6月间，将要生产几千万头小猪。现在各地的养猪专业队伍正在磨拳擦掌，准备为这一大批小猪接生，为今年养猪业的继续跃进打好基础。
    能不能保证这一大批小猪全生、全活和全壮？对于这个问题必须给以完全肯定的回答。有些人认为，大批小猪生下来，死亡一些在所难免，无法保证全活，更不能保证全壮。这是小农经济时代的陈旧观念的反映。在小农经济时代，一个农家养一两头猪，由于人力、物力、财力的限制，不可能建立科学的管理制度，不可能预防和扑灭猪疫病，不可能加强母猪的营养和护理，仔猪生下来了，瘦弱多病，难免死亡。现在，我们的养猪业是以集体饲养为基础的社会主义大经济。依靠人民公社的雄厚力量，实行科学的饲养管理，完全可以保证最大限度地提高小猪的成活率。
    要保证这一大批小猪全活、全壮，最重要的是要妥善地解决饲料问题。小猪和哺乳母猪，都要吃得好些，都要求一定数量的精饲料。对于饲料问题，人们可能会有两种不同的态度：一种是坐等上级支援；一种是集中群众智慧，采取各种措施，用“穷棒子”精神自力更生解决饲料问题。无数经验证明，只要树立了高速度发展养猪事业的雄心壮志，又能充分发动广大群众想办法，饲料问题是完全有可能解决的。我国是一个大农业国，农产品异常丰富，许多地区一年四季都可以种植各种作物。只要继续贯彻“以青粗饲料为主，适当搭配精料”的方针，按照“靠山吃山、靠水吃水”的原则，实行种植、采集和加工同时并举，饲料问题就能够得到解决。至于精饲料，今年广东、安徽、湖南、辽宁、四川、陕西等十九个省市，已拨饲料地四千五百万亩，采取套种、轮种等办法，种植了许多高产饲料。认真管好这些饲料地，在5、6月份即可收获一大批饲料，包括部分精料。各地还可以抓紧季节，利用田边地角、屋前屋后、荒坡隙地，大量增种瓜类、豆类作物和蔬菜，解决青黄不接时期的饲料问题。
    解决饲料问题要长打算，短安排。既算一年所需饲料的大账，也算每个时期需要的饲料的细账。例如，究竟有多少母猪怀仔，可能有多少小猪出生，5、6两月可能生多少，究竟需要多少青粗饲料，多少精饲料等等，畜牧战线的领导部门应该心中有数，分类分月规划，层层落实，计划生产，计划供应。
    饲料问题解决了，饲养管理还要跟上。许多地方的经验表明：同等数量的饲料，由于饲养管理好坏不同，小猪的成活率就相差很多。首先要把母猪养好。母猪健壮，奶水充足，才能喂好小猪，增强小猪的体质和抗疫能力。小猪断奶、改吃饲料的时候，是小猪能否成活的一关。如果精粗饲料搭配不好，小猪消化不良，极易患病死亡。因此，应该提早加喂辅助饲料，增强小猪的消化能力；实行分圈饲养、分群管理；加强防疫工作，减少小猪患病的机会。
    今年养猪计划的胜利完成，关键在于5、6月份的大干特干。我们要下定决心，把迎接大批小猪出生这一仗坚决打好。一定要实现今年上半年养猪业的满堂红！
