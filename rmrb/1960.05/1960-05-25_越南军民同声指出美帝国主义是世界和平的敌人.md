    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 23rd. According to today's "Capital Hanoi Newspaper," people from all walks of life in Hanoi and commanders and fighters of the Vietnam People's Army, in interviews with reporters from the newspaper, strongly condemned the crime of U.S. imperialism in undermining the four-power summit conference and firmly supported the solemn position of the Soviet Union.
    Captain Nguyen Truc, who participated in the Dien Bien Phu battle, said, "We have a very clear understanding of the war nature of imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. Our People's Army warmly welcomes the Soviet Union's downing of the U.S. U-2 spy plane. This incident exposed the warmongering truth of U.S. imperialism, which pretends to want peace, and at the same time raised the vigilance of the people of the world. We want peace, but we are not begging for peace from U.S. imperialism. If they provoke a war, then, as Comrade Khrushchev said, they will be crushed."
    Tao Trong Binh, who worked as a national defense worker during the War of Resistance Against Japan, said, "U.S. imperialism talks about peace, but in reality, it undermines peace. And at the time when the highest-level meeting was held, the face of U.S. imperialism was exposed even more clearly. The American tune can only make the world's working class see more clearly that they are the enemy of peace, and make the working class more actively fight to defend peace."
    Comrade Vuong, who was gathered from Phu Dien district, Thua Thien province, South Vietnam, to the North of Vietnam and is receiving treatment at Bach Mai Hospital, said, "Whenever I talk about U.S. imperialism, I think of South Vietnam, and I think of the United States-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, which is dividing our country and slaughtering our people." He said that after hearing the news that U.S. imperialism had undermined the summit conference, he felt extremely angry.
    Prominent Vietnamese lawyer Du Xuan Shuang expressed his complete agreement with the Soviet Union's position. He said, "The incident of the U.S. U-2 plane invading the Soviet Union for reconnaissance seriously violated the national sovereignty of the Soviet Union. More seriously, U.S. Secretary of State Herter announced that the United States would continue to do so in the future and believed that this was the 'national policy' of the United States. For people like U.S. imperialism who are extremely stubborn in committing crimes and refuse to admit their guilt, and use the rhetoric of thugs to quibble and threaten the other party, it is completely impossible to sit down and conduct effective negotiations with them."

    越南军民同声指出美帝国主义是世界和平的敌人
    新华社河内23日电　据“首都河内报”今天报道：河内各界人民和越南人民军指挥员、战斗员在向这家报纸记者发表谈话时，强烈谴责美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议的罪行，坚决支持苏联的严正立场。
    曾经参加过奠边府战役的阮祝大尉说，“我们对帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义的战争本质看得很清楚。我们人民军热烈欢迎苏联击落美国U—2型间谍飞机。这件事揭穿了假装要和平的美帝国主义的好战真相，同时提高了世界人民的警惕。我们要和平，但是我们不是向美帝国主义乞求和平。如果它们挑起战争，那么，正如赫鲁晓夫同志所说的，他们将被粉碎。”
    抗战时期曾经当过国防工人的陶仲丙说，“美帝国主义口里谈和平，但实际上破坏和平。而在最高级会议召开的时候，美帝国主义的面目暴露得更清楚了。美国的论调只能使世界的工人阶级更清楚地看到它们是和平的敌人，使工人阶级更积极地为保卫和平而斗争。”
    从南越承天省丰田县集结到越南北方，正在白梅医院疗养的旺同志说，“一谈到美帝国主义，我就想起南越，想起正在分裂我国、残杀我国人民的美国—吴庭艳集团。”他说，听到美帝国主义破坏首脑会议的消息后，他感到无比愤怒。
    越南著名律师杜春爽表示完全赞同苏联的立场。他说，“美国U—2型飞机侵入苏联进行侦察的事件，严重地侵犯了苏联的国家主权。更严重的是，美国国务卿赫脱宣布美国今后还要继续这样做，并认为这是美国的‘国策’。对于像美帝国主义这样极其顽固的犯罪不认罪、并用暴徒的论调来狡辩和威胁对方的人，完全不能坐下来同他们进行有效的谈判。”
