Reading Chairman Ho Chi Minh's Poems
	Yuan Ying

	The autumn in Hanoi is full of fresh poetic charm. For a whole afternoon, we buried ourselves in the revolutionary cultural relics archive of the Central Library. Our hearts were completely captivated by a handwritten copy of poems.

	This is a great poem written by a great poet. In 1942, Chairman Ho Chi Minh was unjustly detained for a year by the Kuomintang bandits in Guangxi Province, China. Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents colluded with Japanese and French imperialist secret agents to illegally arrest the Vietnamese people's leader when he risked danger to step onto Chinese soil from Vietnam. In prison, Chairman Ho Chi Minh wrote more than a hundred poems, all in Chinese classical style using Chinese characters. Chairman Ho Chi Minh inscribed four characters on the cover: "Diary in Prison."

	We stared at this small booklet bound with native paper, and our hearts could not calm down for a long time. Through the dark prison life of old China, we heard the heartbeat of a great revolutionary. Though his body was in shackles, his heart was on the land of his motherland, in the storm of the struggle against the enemy. Chairman Ho used the following four lines as the opening of "Diary in Prison":

	The body is in prison, the spirit is outside,
	To accomplish great things, the spirit must be greater.

	Turning to the first page, under the title "Opening the Book," Chairman Ho wrote:

	I originally did not love to chant poetry, but because there is nothing to do in prison,
	I borrow chanting poetry to pass the long days, chanting and waiting for the time of freedom.

	In the long sleepless nights, he wrote and wrote, one poem after another, but "freedom" was still illusory.

	Unable to sleep through the vast long night, I made hundreds of prison poems,
	I often put down my pen after writing one, looking out from the cage door at the sky of freedom.
							("Sleepless Night")

	Chairman Ho Chi Minh was in prison, but his heart was always concerned about the motherland, thinking of the Vietnamese people who were suffering greatly. After decades of plunder by French colonialists, Japanese imperialists stepped onto Vietnamese soil. The struggle against imperialism was being carried out arduously; the motherland needed him, the struggle needed him, but he had wings and could not fly. The great patriot expressed his worries and grievances in his poems:

	One watch, two watches, and then three watches, tossing and turning, unable to sleep,
	Only when it was four or five watches did I close my eyes, my dreams circling around the five-pointed star.
							("Unable to Sleep")

	A guard with a gun stands in front of the door, the remaining clouds in the sky fly with the moon,
	Wood lice run rampant like tanks, mosquitoes gather and disperse like airplanes,
	My heart is full of thousands of miles of homeland, my dreams are filled with thousands of strands of new sorrow,
	Imprisoned without guilt for a year, the old man writes prison poems with tears.
							("Autumn Night")

	He missed the people of his motherland, and also missed the comrades who were fighting the enemy day and night.

	In the past, you saw me off to the riverbank, asking me when I would return, pointing to the new grain,
	Now the new fields have been plowed, and I am a prisoner in a foreign land.
					("Remembering a Friend")

	When occasionally seeing a little news of the motherland's struggle between the lines of the reactionary newspapers, he felt even more excited and agitated:

	Rather die than endure the bitterness of slavery, the banner of righteousness flies everywhere again,
	It is a pity that I am a prisoner, unable to personally go to the battlefield.
		("Ngong Newspaper: Vietnam Has Disturbances")

	A great revolutionary is always a person who maintains vigorous vitality. His eyes are like torches, piercing through the distant future. He can see the dawn in the dark night, and foresee the sunny day in the full sky of storms. It is precisely because he has mastered the law of historical development that he is so radiant and full of revolutionary optimism. Reading Chairman Ho's poems, although the prison life described is so dark, so indignant, and so shocking, what is overflowing in the poet's pen is the infinitely beautiful prospect, and the infinite confidence in gaining freedom!

	The sun shines on the wall every morning, on the unbolted cage door,
	The cage is still dark at the moment, but the light is already coming.
						("Morning")

	This revolutionary optimism runs through the entire collection of poems. His exposure and pungent satire of the reactionary black prison, his sympathy for fellow inmates, his yearning for light, and his concern for the motherland all deeply infect people. From these more than a hundred poems, we seem to see the great benevolence, great wisdom, and great courage of this great proletarian leader.

	This was more than three years ago, but the feelings when reading "Diary in Prison" are still so profound, encouraging myself to move forward. Today, as we celebrate the seventieth birthday of our beloved Chairman Ho Chi Minh, rereading it is even more cordial. We respectfully wish the old man longevity, like the evergreen pine of Nanshan, forever lush and green!

	[The People's Literature Publishing House has recently published Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "'Diary in Prison' Selected Poems" to celebrate Chairman Ho Chi Minh's seventieth birthday.]

### 读胡志明主席的诗

    读胡志明主席的诗
    袁鹰
    河内的秋天，充满了清新的诗意。整整一下午，我们埋头在中央图书馆的革命文物档案室里。我们的心，整个地被一本手抄本的诗所吸引住了。
    这是一位伟大的诗人写的一本伟大的诗篇。1942年，胡志明主席在中国广西省被国民党匪帮无辜羁押了一年之久。蒋介石的特务同日本、法国帝国主义的特务相勾结，当这位越南人民领袖冒着危险从越南踏上中国土地的时候，就非法地逮捕了他。在监狱里，胡志明主席写了一百多首诗，都是用汉字写的中国旧体诗。胡志明主席在封面上题了四个字：“狱中日记”。
    我们凝视着这个用土纸订成的小本子，心情好久不能平静下来。透过旧中国黑暗的牢狱生活，我们听到了一个伟大的革命者的心的跳动。他身在缧绁之中，心却在祖国的土地上，在对敌斗争的风暴里。胡主席用这样的四行作为“狱中日记”的卷首：
    身体在狱中，精神在狱外，
    欲成大事业，精神更要大。
    翻开第一页，在“开卷”这一题下，胡主席写道：
    老夫原不爱吟诗，因为囚中无所为，
    聊借吟诗消永日，且吟且待自由时。
    在漫长的不眠之夜，他写着写着，一首又一首，然而“自由”还是虚无缥缈。
    茫茫长夜不能眠，我做囚诗百几篇，
    做了一篇常搁笔，从笼门望自由天。
                            （“不眠夜”）
    胡志明主席身在狱中，心却是时时刻刻都关注着祖国，思念着灾难重重的越南人民。在法国殖民者掠夺了几十年之后，日本帝国主义者又踏上越南的土地。反对帝国主义的斗争，正在艰苦地进行；祖国需要他，斗争需要他，然而，他有翅难飞。伟大的爱国者在诗句里抒发了自己的忧愤心怀：
    一更二更又三更，辗转低回睡不成，
    四五更时才合眼，梦魂环绕五尖星。
                              （“睡不着”）
    门前卫士执枪立，天上残云带月飞，
    木虱纵横如坦克，蚊虫聚散似飞机，
    心怀故国千塘路，梦绕新愁万缕丝，
    无罪而囚已一载，老夫和泪写囚诗。
                            （“秋夜”）
    他怀念着祖国人民，也怀念着正在同敌人日夜斗争的战友。
    昔君送我至江滨，问我归期指谷新，
    现在新田已犁好，他乡我作狱中人。
                      （“忆友”）
    当偶尔从反动派报纸上的字里行间看到一点祖国斗争的消息时，心情就更加兴奋和激动了：
    宁死不甘奴隶苦，义旗到处又飘扬，
    可怜余作囚中客，未得躬亲上战场。
          （“邕报：越有骚动”）
    伟大的革命者总是一个永远保持着蓬勃朝气的人。他目光如炬，直透遥远的未来。他能在暗夜如磐中看到晨曦，在满天暴风雨里预见到晴天。正是由于他掌握了历史发展的规律，所以他才那么神采奕奕地充满了革命乐观主义精神。读胡主席的诗，虽然描写的监狱生活是那么黑暗，那么令人愤慨，那么怵目惊心，但是，洋溢在诗人笔下的，却是无限美好的前景，是对获得自由的无限信心！
    太阳每早从墙上，照着笼门闩未开，
    笼里现时还黑暗，光明却已面前来。
                        （“早”）
    这种革命的乐观主义精神，贯穿在整个诗集中。他对反动派黑狱的暴露和辛辣的讽刺，对同狱难友的同情，对光明的向往和对祖国的关怀，都使人深深地受到感染。从这一百多首诗里，我们仿佛看见了这位伟大的无产阶级领袖的大仁、大智、大勇的心胸。
    这是三年多以前的事情了，但是读“狱中日记”时的感受，至今还是那么深刻，鼓舞着自己前进。今天，正当我们敬爱的胡志明主席七旬大寿的时候，再一展卷，倍加亲切。敬祝老人家万寿无疆，像南山不老松一样，永远郁郁青青！
    〔人民文学出版社为了庆祝胡志明主席七十寿辰，最近已出版了胡志明主席的《“狱中日记”诗抄》。〕
