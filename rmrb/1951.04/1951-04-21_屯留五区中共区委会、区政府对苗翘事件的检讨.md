To the Editors:

We were suffering from extremely serious complacency. Last June, after the incident in Miao Qiao Village, our district, where village chief Yang Renhe favored a landlord and beat Li Fuchang's wife, we only considered it a problem of work style. Therefore, we only educated Yang Renhe not to infringe on human rights, and did not point out the seriousness of his losing his revolutionary stance. However, the village branch had a high degree of vigilance and struggled against Yang Renhe's erroneous behavior. After the Li Fuchang family was murdered, the village branch felt the matter was suspicious and reported it to the district committee. However, the district committee simply replied: "It may be poisoning, or it may be plague. You (referring to village cadres) should publicize the prevention of plague to the masses on the one hand, and monitor the activities of the landlords on the other." It was not treated as a problem to be studied. Therefore, the district committee thought the matter was over after suggesting that the district government send someone to investigate and report to the county committee. After Cui Chengzhuang was arrested in the county, we still did not recognize that this was a counter-revolutionary incident of landlords launching a counter-attack against the peasants.

From the above facts, the complacency in the leadership of our district committee and district government is extremely serious. We did not impose any restraint or suppression on the illegal activities of the reactionary landlord Cui Chengzhuang, nor did we give appropriate education and punishment to village chief Yang Renhe for his behavior of losing his revolutionary stance, which led to this bloody tragedy.

Secondly, after the Li Fuchang family was poisoned, we did not actively investigate, study, and treat them. This shows that not only do all our district cadres lack the necessary political acumen, but also their mass viewpoint is very weak. In terms of work style, it shows serious bureaucratism.

Now, all of our district cadres have made strict criticism and self-criticism on this issue, and unanimously expressed that they will remember this bloody lesson: 1. Strengthen political current affairs study among all district cadres to thoroughly liquidate the idea of underestimating the enemy and complacency. 2. Strengthen the publicity of patriotism and resistance to the U.S. and aid to Korea in the village branches, and combine the Miao Qiao incident and the Ji Shan incident to educate every party member, so that they can remember this bloody lesson, eliminate the idea of peace, and improve their vigilance and fighting will. 3. Hold a memorial meeting for Li Fuchang, centered on the base point village, strengthen the publicity of current political affairs, enlighten the political consciousness of the peasant masses, and mobilize the masses to consciously participate actively in the patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, assist the government in severely suppressing counter-revolutionary activities and the counter-attack of illegal landlords, and defend the motherland and the fruits of liberation.

The Entire Cadres of the Tounliu Fifth District CCP District Committee and District Government

(Editor's Note: Those who violated laws and neglected their duties in this incident should be subjected to strict inspection and handling. It is hoped that the Tounliu Fifth District Committee and the District Government will continue to conduct in-depth self-criticism and improve their work.)

　　屯留五区中共区委会、区政府对苗翘事件的检讨编辑同志：
    我们是存在着极严重的麻痹思想的。去年六月，我区苗翘村村长杨仁合偏袒地主吊打李福昌老婆的事件发生后，我们仅仅认为这是一个作风问题，因此对杨仁合只进行了不应侵犯人权的教育，并没有指出其丧失革命立场的严重错误。但是该村支部警觉性很高，与杨仁合的这种错误行为进行了斗争。在李福昌全家被害后，村支部感到事情可疑，便向区委会报告。但区委会却是简单地答复：“可能是中毒，也可能是瘟疫。你们（指村干部）一方面要向群众宣传防止瘟疫，另一方面要监视地主的活动。”并没有当成一个问题来研究。因此区委会在建议区政府派人去了解，和向县委报告后，就以为事情已告结束。在县里逮捕了崔成庄后，我们还没有认识这是地主向农民反攻的反革命事件。
    从上述事实看，我们区委会、区政府领导上的麻痹思想是极为严重的。我们对反动地主崔成庄的不法行为，没有加以丝毫制止和镇压，对村长杨仁合的丧失革命立场行为，也未给以适当的教育和处分，以致发生了这一血的惨案。
    其次，农民李福昌全家中毒后，我们没有积极调查、研究和治疗。这说明我区全体干部不但没有一点应有的政治嗅觉，就是群众观点也是很薄弱的。在工作作风上表现了严重的官僚主义。
    现在，我们全体区干部对这一问题已作了严格的批判与检讨，一致表示要记取这一血的教训：一、在全体区干部中加强政治时事学习，彻底清算轻敌麻痹思想。二、在各村支部中加强抗美援朝爱国主义的宣传，并结合苗翘事件和稷山事件来教育每个党员，要他们记取这一血的教训，消除太平观念，提高警惕性和斗争意志。三、以基点村为中心召开追悼李福昌大会，加强时事政治宣传，启发农民群众的政治觉悟，发动群众自觉地起来积极参加抗美援朝爱国运动，协助政府严厉镇压反革命活动和不法地主的反攻，保卫祖国和保卫翻身果实。
    屯留五区中共区委会、区政府全体干部
    （编者按：这一事件中的违法失职人员，应进行严格的检查和处理。希望屯留五区区委会和区政府继续进行深入检讨，改进自己的工作。）
