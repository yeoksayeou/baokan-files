Struggle for a Universal Resist-America-Aid-Korea Movement

　　The Experience of the Resist-America-Aid-Korea Movement in Hebei Province Deserves Attention
    Yin Zhe
    The Resist-America-Aid-Korea and Defend-Our-Homes-and-Country movement in the urban and rural areas of Hebei Province began in mid-October last year, based on the peace signature campaign conducted by 18 million people across the province. After the Spring Festival Resist-America-Aid-Korea Movement Propaganda Week (generally from February 1st to 15th, some extended to the 20th or the end of February), the patriotic movement of Resist-America-Aid-Korea was widely launched in various cities and towns and vast rural areas of the province.

    In October of last year, when the movement had just begun, it was shortly after the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops landed at Incheon in Korea. At that time, whether among cadres or people of all social strata, there were some differences and disputes regarding how to understand the issue of U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea and the resulting relationship between China and Korea (mainly the issue of whether we should or should not pay attention to U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea), as well as the understanding of U.S. imperialism. Panic and fluctuations even occurred among some people. Although correct understanding and attitude held a dominant advantage among cadres and people of all social strata, right-leaning sentiments of fearing the U.S., a national inferiority complex of admiring the U.S., and reactionary thoughts of being pro-U.S. existed among some people. The Resist-America-Aid-Korea and Defend-Our-Homes-and-Country movement, which lasted for more than five months, conducted an extremely profound test for all cadres and people of all circles, greatly enhancing the people's political awareness. Erroneous and reactionary thoughts such as fearing the U.S., admiring the U.S., and being pro-U.S. have now been basically dispelled; the views of hating, despising, and scorning U.S. imperialism have been further established among people of all circles; the majority of the masses have a correct and affirmative understanding of the relationship between China and Korea and that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger that looks strong but is weak inside. At the same time, the vast majority of the people have universally enhanced their love for the motherland; national self-esteem and self-confidence have also been greatly strengthened, thereby more forcefully promoting the production movement and various tasks.

    The Resist-America-Aid-Korea movement in Hebei Province was carried out relatively universally during the Spring Festival and achieved considerable results. At the same time, it accumulated several important experiences for continuing to carry out this movement.

    First, the issue of organizing and mobilizing forces is an important key to whether the movement can be carried out extensively.

    At that time, when schools at all levels were on Spring Festival vacation and party schools of the provincial and prefectural committees were on holiday for training party members, various localities fully used these forces. In addition to mobilizing cadres at all levels to participate in propaganda without exception and play a leading and guiding role in the movement, they focused on organizing teachers, students, trained party member cadres returning home for vacation, as well as cadres returning home for the Spring Festival, and the vast number of village cadres, party members, league members, and intellectuals in the countryside. For example, Fuyu Girls' Middle School in Tong County divided all 220 students returning home for the holiday into propaganda groups according to region. According to incomplete statistics, they made 930 household visits, propagandized 2,884 people, and, combined with literary and artistic activities, held group meetings, mass meetings, etc., propagandizing 8,380 people, and propagandized more than 900 people on the streets, for a total of more than 12,160 people. Among the 123 cadres from Lixian, Quyang, and Xinle who returned home for the Spring Festival, 119 conducted various forms of Resist-America-Aid-Korea propaganda in their hometowns. Due to the wide mobilization and organization of propaganda forces, the area of propaganda in many areas has reached a considerable level of popularity: according to statistics from Baixiang, Ningjin, Longyao, and Pingxiang counties, the villages where Resist-America-Aid-Korea propaganda was popularized accounted for 80 to 90 percent of the total number of villages.

    Second, the form of literary and artistic propaganda has been widely used, which is a form most welcomed by the masses.

    The literary and artistic propaganda teams organized during the Spring Festival were unprecedentedly magnificent, including not only all the theater troupes and various artists, but also temporarily mobilizing a large number of teachers, students, workers, and farmers to participate in literary and artistic propaganda activities, and even mobilizing a group of elderly people and peasant women who had never participated in such activities to participate. According to incomplete statistics from 51 counties, towns, and four cities, there were 2,431 new and old theater troupes participating in the Spring Festival propaganda, with more than 145,380 actors; in Ding County alone, more than 20,000 people participated in the performance. In addition to carrying out decentralized propaganda activities, many places gathered in the county seat or central area around the Lantern Festival for a meeting competition and concentrated performances. For example, Shijiazhuang City organized more than 300 workers' waist drum teams and nearly 10,000 rural peasants' theater troupes, dragon lanterns, Shehuo, and big drums to hold a grand competition, which lasted for several days and attracted more than 20,000 spectators. What is very different about this year's literary and artistic propaganda from the past is that the content is closely integrated with the current political struggle tasks. The general content revolves around the center of Resist-America-Aid-Korea and promoting patriotism, closely combined with encouraging production, banning reactionary secret societies, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Another feature is that many literary and artistic programs are created by the masses. For example, peasants in Ding County, Wuji, and Xinle independently created and performed no less than 200 new dramas, and there were 180 literary and artistic works from the masses in Luan County, and more than 170 in Fengnan. Many old literary and artistic forms have been enriched with new content, such as the small cart club and the dry boat in Ding County Prefecture and Daming and Yutian, which were changed to "Supporting the Korean War," "Sending Comfort Goods," "Sending Public Grain," and "Sending Volunteers," and the lion dance was changed to "Exposing the Paper Tiger of U.S. Imperialism"; As for propaganda forms such as slideshow projections, pictures, and photo exhibitions, many places have also adopted them and are quite popular with the masses. For example, the Resist-America-Aid-Korea exhibition held in Tangshan City attracted 76,000 visitors in six days. After the exhibition, the peasants in the suburbs continued to demand that the exhibition time be extended. Some backward and feudal things were also found in the content of literary and artistic propaganda in a few places. All have been met with dissatisfaction and opposition from the masses.

    Third, mobilizing and organizing the masses to accuse the atrocities of the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits is one of the effective ways to guide the masses to resolutely take action to Resist-America-Aid-Korea, oppose the United States imperialism arming Japan, and assist the government in severely suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

    In Shijiazhuang City, 66 of the 76 industries have separately held accusations against the U.S., Japan, and Chiang Kai-shek bandits. 3,058 households participated in the accusation (accounting for 75% of the total number of industrial and commercial households), with 11,345 people. At a mass meeting of more than 500 people in Pingyang Village, Fuping Third District, the atrocities of the Japanese invaders against the brutal massacre of the villagers of Pingyang were accused (the enemy created the bloody "Pingyang Massacre" in this village), which highly aroused the masses' hatred for the enemy. They gathered in front of the "Thousand People Tomb" and vowed: "We will never let the United States arm our enemies, and we will resolutely avenge the dead martyrs. The United States is our biggest enemy, and we will resolutely ask the United States to pay back the blood debt!" In Tangshan Prefecture, more than one million peasants in Fengnan, Linyu, Funing, Changli, Luan County, Fengrun, Lulong, and other seven counties participated in small meetings, symposiums, recalling accusations, or large gatherings and parades. In the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in Tianjin Prefecture, 230,000 people were mobilized to accuse the crimes of the Japanese invaders and counter-revolutionaries at various gatherings. Old hatred and new hatred flooded the hearts of the people, greatly strengthening the masses' determination to thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionaries.

    Fourth, various small symposiums are a good way to gather the masses, conduct in-depth propaganda, and easily solve the specific ideological problems of the masses.

    Since the peace signature movement, many places have frequently convened mass meetings. Due to poor organization, coupled with some cadres' propaganda being divorced from reality and unable to connect well with the masses' personal requirements and feelings, the masses could not help but feel somewhat bored. Small symposiums can avoid these shortcomings, especially during the busy farming season, this form is particularly necessary (of course, necessary mass meetings still need to be held). Here we can cite the example of Dazhao Village in Sanhe: the village has a total of 145 households and 767 people. Usually, mass meetings can only attract about 140 people at most, especially fewer women; During the Spring Festival propaganda, the propaganda team that came to the village cooperated with the village cadres to divide the whole village into three areas, with men and women taking turns, using the evening time to hold small symposiums, a total of three times, with about 320 people each time, accounting for more than 90% of adults, and women accounted for more than 35% of the number of attendees. This method of propaganda that goes deep into the masses deserves to be widely promoted and adopted.

    Fifth, in-depth ideological mobilization, unified and timely supervision and inspection are a decisive link in organizing all aspects of forces to invest in the movement and grasping the steady development of the movement.

    Before the start of the movement, party leading organs at all levels had mobilized and arranged various cadre meetings and specialized meetings of teachers, literary and art workers, and student meetings, and the main leading cadres made reports on current events and tasks. Some cities and counties had transmitted the plan to the party branch and helped the branch study and formulate implementation methods. Cadres of Tangshan City, districts, factories, and mines directly reported current events and carried out propaganda and mobilization to workers, students, and people from all walks of life. More than 40,000 people in the city heard this report. In order to unify the leadership of the Resist-America-Aid-Korea movement, Tangshan Prefecture and its subordinate counties established and improved the Resist-America-Aid-Korea Committee and set up full-time offices: the prefecture set up five people, and each county set up two or three people; the committee absorbed representatives from all aspects to participate, so as to promote the Resist-America-Aid-Korea movement in all circles. After the start of the movement, inspection work is very important. One way of inspection is to send people down to conduct on-the-spot inspections, and the other is to call people up to report. The Hebei Provincial Party Committee has organized several inspections. Experience has proved that the inspection work itself is a driving force. The place where this leadership method is not paid attention to is often the place where the movement is enthusiastic at the beginning, but will soon decline, and even make the movement unable to develop.

    Although the Resist-America-Aid-Korea movement in Hebei Province has achieved considerable results, the following problems still exist:

    First, the degree of popularization of the Resist-America-Aid-Korea movement is still far from enough, and the province still shows great imbalances. Generally speaking, cities and towns are better, and rural areas are worse; from a regional perspective, in mountainous areas, flood-stricken areas, and remote villages on the plains, the propaganda of Resist-America-Aid-Korea has not been extended to most of them, or even if propaganda has been carried out, only a small number of people have been educated. To achieve the goal of everyone receiving this education everywhere, a lot of effort is still needed.

    Second, how to continue and deepen the Resist-America-Aid-Korea movement in areas where it has already been launched, so that it truly becomes a driving force that plays a role at all times in various tasks, has not been resolved in the organizational leadership and leadership thinking of some leading organs and leading cadres. This is mainly manifested in isolating the Resist-America-Aid-Korea movement, or even opposing it to other tasks, such as spring farming production and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, or underestimating and insufficiently understanding the political task of Resist-America-Aid-Korea and failing to strengthen leadership. Leading organs at all levels should take effective measures to quickly correct this.

    Third, although the ideological awareness of the masses has been greatly improved during the five-month Resist-America-Aid-Korea movement, sufficient patriotic ideology and a correct understanding of the current situation have not yet been established among all the people, and erroneous thoughts such as fearing the United States and admiring the United States have not been thoroughly eliminated. This still requires a considerable long-term and serious ideological education and struggle.

　　河北省抗美援朝运动的经验值得重视
    尹哲
    河北省城乡的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，是从去年十月中旬在全省一千八百万人举行了和平签名的基础上开始的。经过春节抗美援朝运动宣传周（一般从二月一日到十五日，有的延长到二十日或二月底），抗美援朝的爱国主义运动便在全省各个城镇及广大乡村广泛展开。
    去年十月间，当运动刚刚开始时，正值美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略军登陆仁川后不久。当时无论在干部或各阶层人民群众中，对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜问题和由此引起的对中朝关系应做如何了解（其中主要是我们对美帝国主义侵朝理与不理的问题），以及对美帝国主义的认识问题，是有若干分歧和争论的。在某些人中甚至发生了恐慌与波动。正确的认识和态度虽然在干部及各阶层人民群众中占着压倒的优势，但恐美的右倾情绪、崇美的民族自卑心理及亲美的反动思想，在一部分人中是存在的。历时五个多月的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，对全体干部及各界人民群众，做了极为深刻的考验，大大提高了人民群众的政治觉悟。恐美、崇美、亲美等错误的和反动的思想，现在基本上已被廓清；仇视、蔑视和鄙视美帝国主义的观点，已在各界人民中进一步树立起来；大部分群众对中朝关系，对美帝国主义是个外强中干的纸老虎，有了正确和肯定的认识。同时，普遍提高了广大人民群众对祖国的热爱；民族自尊心与自信心也已大大加强，从而更有力地推动了生产运动及各种工作。
    河北省抗美援朝运动，在春节期间，开展得比较普遍，获得了相当的成绩。同时积累了继续开展这一运动的几点重要经验。
    首先，是组织与动员力量问题，这是运动能否开展得广泛的重要关键。
    当时，正当各级学校春节放假和省委及地委党校集训党员休假的时候，各地便充分地使用了这批力量。除动员各级干部无例外地参加宣传，并在运动中起带头、指导作用外，着重组织放假回家的教员、学生、受训的党员干部以及春节回家的干部以及广大的村干部、党员、团员及在乡知识分子。如通县富育女中，将全校假期回家的学生二百二十人，按地区编成宣传小组。据不完全的统计，她们共作家庭访问九百三十户，宣传了二千八百八十四人，结合文艺活动，召开片会、群众会等，宣传了八千三百八十人，在街头宣传了九百多人，共宣传了一万二千一百六十多人。蠡县、曲阳、新乐回家过年的一百二十三个干部中，有一百一十九人在家乡进行了各种方式的抗美援朝宣传。由于宣传力量动员与组织的广泛，因而宣传的面积在不少地区已经达到了相当普及的程度：据柏乡、宁晋、隆尧、平乡四个县的统计，抗美援朝宣传普及到的村庄，占村庄总数的百分之八十到九十。
    其次，文艺宣传的形式曾被广泛利用，这是最受群众欢迎的一种形式。
    春节中组织起来的文艺宣传队伍是空前壮阔的，不但包括了所有的剧团和各种艺人，还临时动员了广大的教员、学生、工人、农民参加了文艺的宣传活动，甚至还发动了一批从来没有参加过这种活动的老年人和农妇也参加了进来。据五十一个县、镇和四个市不完全的统计，参加春节宣传的新旧剧团就有二千四百三十一个，演员共十四万五千三百八十多人；定县一个县参加演出者即达二万多人。这样庞大的文艺宣传队伍，除进行了分散的宣传活动外，不少地方在元宵节前后曾会集到县城或中心区进行会师竞赛和集中的演出。如石家庄市曾组织了三百多个工人的腰鼓队和近万人的郊区农民的剧团、龙灯、社火、大鼓等举行大竞赛，历时数日，观众达二万余人。今年的文艺宣传与以往大不相同的，是内容紧密地结合了当前的政治斗争任务。总的内容都是围绕着抗美援朝发扬爱国主义这一中心，密切地结合了鼓励生产、取缔反动会道门、镇压反革命等工作。另一个特点，是文艺节目很多为群众创作。如定县、无极、新乐农民自编自演的新剧不下二百多种，滦县来自群众的文艺作品有一百八十件，丰南也有一百七十来件。很多旧的文艺形式充实了新的内容，如定县专区及大名、玉田等地，将旧形式的小车会、旱船，改为“支援朝鲜战争”、“送慰劳品”、“送公粮”、“送志愿军”等，将狮子会改为“戳穿美帝国主义纸老虎”；至于幻灯放映、图片、照片展览等宣传形式，很多地方也都采用了，并也颇为群众所欢迎。如唐山市所举行的抗美援朝展览会，六天中观众达七万六千人，展览结束后，郊区农民还不断要求延长展览时间。文艺宣传的内容，在少数地方也发现了一些落后的封建的东西。都遭到了群众的不满和反对。
    第三、发动与组织群众控诉日寇、蒋匪暴行，是引导群众坚决行动起来进行抗美援朝、反对美帝国主义武装日本，并协助政府严厉镇压反革命的有效办法之一。
    石家庄市在七十六个行业中，已有六十六个行业对美、日、蒋匪分别举行了控诉。参加控诉者三千零五十八户（占工商业总户数的百分之七十五），一万一千三百四十五人。阜平三区平阳村在五百多人的群众大会上，控诉日寇对平阳村民残暴的大屠杀（敌人在这村曾制造了血腥的“平阳惨案”），高度激发了群众对敌人的仇恨，他们齐集在“千人墓”前宣誓：“决不让美国武装我们的仇人，坚决替死难的烈士报仇雪恨。美国就是我们最大的仇人，坚决向美国要回血债！”唐山专区丰南、临榆、抚宁、昌黎、滦县、丰润、卢龙等七个县，有百余万农民参加了小会座谈回忆控诉或大的集会与游行。天津专区在镇压反革命中，曾发动了二十三万人在各种集会上控诉日寇及反革命的罪恶，旧仇新恨一齐涌上人民的心头，大大坚定了群众彻底肃清反革命的决心。
    第四、各色各样的小型座谈会，是便于集合群众，深入宣传，和容易解决群众具体思想问题的好方法。
    从和平签名运动以来，很多地方曾频繁地召开了群众大会，由于组织得不好，加上有些干部宣传上的脱离实际，不能很好联系群众的切身要求与感情，以致不能不使得群众感觉有些厌烦。小型的座谈会是可以避免这些缺点的，特别在农忙季节，这种形式尤属必要（当然必要的群众大会还是要开的）。这里可以举三河大赵庄村的例子：这个村共一百四十五户，七百六十七人，平常开群众大会，每次最多能到一百四十人左右，尤其妇女到的更少；在春节宣传中，到这村来的宣传队员配合村干部将全村划分为三片，男女轮班，利用晚上时间召开小型座谈会，共开三次，每次到三百二十人左右，占成年人的百分之九十以上，妇女占到会人数的百分之三十五还多。这种深入群众的宣传方法是值得广泛提倡采用的。
    第五、深入地思想动员，统一地及时地督促与检查，是组织各方面的力量投入运动及把握运动稳步发展的决定性的一环。
    各级党的领导机关，在运动开始以前都经过各种干部会以及专门召开的教员会议、文艺工作者会议、学生会议等进行动员和布置，并由主要领导干部作时事和任务的报告，有的市、县一直将计划传达到党的支部，并帮助支部研究订出实施的办法。唐山市市、区、厂矿干部直接向工人、学生及各界人民做时事报告和进行宣传、动员。听到这种报告的全市达四万多人。为统一抗美援朝的运动领导，唐山专区及所属各县，均建立与健全了抗美援朝委员会，并设专职办公室：专区设五人，各县设二、三人不等；委员会吸收各方面的代表人物参加，以便于推动各界的抗美援朝运动。运动开始后，检查工作很重要，检查的办法一个是派人下去进行实地视察，一个是调人上来汇报。河北省委曾组织了数次检查。经验证明，检查工作的本身就是一种推动的力量。不注意这项领导方法的地方，往往是运动在开始时热烈，但不久就要消沉，甚至使运动开展不起来。
    河北省的抗美援朝运动，虽然有了相当成绩，但还存在着如下的问题：
    第一、抗美援朝运动普及的程度还很不够，全省还表现着很大的不平衡。一般地说，是城镇较好，乡村较差；从地区上看，在山区、水灾区及平原上较偏僻的村庄，抗美援朝的宣传大部还没有伸入进去，或者虽也进行了宣传，但受到教育的人也只是一小部分。要想达到每一处每一人都受到这种教育的目标，还需要做很大的努力。
    第二、抗美援朝运动已经开展的地区，如何继续与深入下去，使之真正成为各种工作时时刻刻发生作用的动力，在部分领导机关和领导干部中尚未从组织领导与领导思想上获得解决。这主要表现在把抗美援朝运动孤立起来，甚至与其他工作，如春耕生产、镇压反革命等对立，或对抗美援朝这一政治任务估计认识不足而不加强领导。各级领导机关应该采取有效的措施，迅速加以纠正。
    第三、历时五个月的抗美援朝运动，群众的思想觉悟虽已有很大提高，但还没有在全体人民中树立起充分的爱国主义思想和对时局的正确认识，彻底肃清恐美、崇美等错误思想。这还需要一个相当长期的严重的思想教育和斗争。
