　　Guarantee the Completion of This Year's Cotton Planting Task
    Shijiazhuang Prefecture Inspects Preparations for Cotton Planting
    Shijiazhuang Prefecture, one of the major cotton-producing areas in Hebei, is making every effort to inspect the preparations for cotton planting. The Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the local CPC Committee have decided to list cotton planting as the central task overriding all others at present, concentrating the strength of cadres from all sides, universally mobilizing the masses to reserve cotton fields, and vigorously promoting the sale of fertilizers, even if it does not rain temporarily, to ensure the completion of this year's cotton planting plan. Last year, the prefecture had a bumper cotton harvest, and the masses are highly enthusiastic about cotton planting. Most districts and villages have conducted publicity and mobilization through Party member meetings, cadre meetings, and mass meetings, and have made village and household cotton planting plans, exceeding the originally stipulated cotton planting task. Most farmers are actively preparing for cotton planting.

    The problems that still exist are: (1) The cotton planting plan has not been fully implemented to households in some areas. For example, in Jin County's Second District, only six out of forty-eight villages have made village and household plans that can meet or exceed the cotton planting task; twenty-eight villages have convened mass meetings for mobilization, but have not deeply organized the making of household cotton planting plans; and fourteen villages are still stuck on the general call for planting more cotton. (2) A large batch of cotton planting fertilizer, soybean cake, is still stockpiled in the supply and marketing cooperatives and cannot be sold. The prefecture has already transported a total of 38 million jin of soybean cake, but only 800,000 jin have been sold. The reason why soybean cake cannot be sold is partly because the masses are not yet accustomed to using soybean cake and there is a mentality of relying on government loans; on the other hand, it is because the supply and marketing cooperatives have failed to organize loans and sales in a timely manner according to the economic situation and cotton planting needs of the masses, and the price has changed many times, which has fueled the masses' wait-and-see attitude. Currently, the sales of soybean cake have become a serious problem in the district's cotton planting work. In addition, cotton seeds from the Liangmian Management District and the Shijiazhuang Farm are very popular among the masses and have been loaned to the masses, but the cotton seeds stored in the supply and marketing cooperatives are of unsatisfactory quality and lending is still a problem. In Jin County, Pingshan and other places, ordinary farmers are worried about the spring drought and lack confidence in completing the cotton planting task.

    In order to solve these problems, the counties in the prefecture have organized cadres from various departments to go to the countryside to directly lead the cotton planting work. The prefecture has also organized a 33-person inspection team, led by the commissioner and the deputy secretary of the local CPC Committee, to inspect the preparations for cotton planting in Jin County, Gaocheng, and Huolu counties, solve various specific problems, and promote the spirit of "carrying water to plant seeds" in 1949 to ensure that this year's cotton planting task is completed even if it does not rain. Regarding the soybean cake problem, the prefecture has requested instructions from the higher-level government to determine the handling method, and is vigorously organizing the masses to exchange, purchase with cash, and purchase on credit, and mobilizing Party members, activists, and model workers to take the lead in purchasing.

### 保证完成今年植棉任务  石家庄专区检查植棉的准备工作

　　保证完成今年植棉任务
    石家庄专区检查植棉的准备工作
    河北主要产棉区之一的石家庄专区，正全力检查植棉准备工作。该专区专署及中共地方委员会已决定将植棉工作列为当前压倒一切的中心任务，集中各方面的干部力量，普遍动员群众留出棉田，大力推销肥料，即使暂时不下雨，也要保证完成今年的植棉计划。该专区去年棉花丰产，群众植棉情绪很高，大部区、村通过党员会、干部会、群众会进行了宣传动员，都作出了村和户的植棉计划，超过了原来规定的植棉任务。大部分农民已在积极进行植棉准备工作。
    目前尚存在的问题是：（一）部分地区植棉计划还没有完全贯彻到户。如晋县二区四十八个村，作好村计划、户计划能够达到或超过植棉任务的还只有六个村；已召开群众会进行动员的，但未深入组织作户的植棉计划的占二十八村；仍然停留在多植棉的一般号召上的占十四村。（二）大批植棉肥料黄豆饼尚囤放在供销合作社，卖不出去。该专区已运到的黄豆饼共三千八百万斤，但只售出了八十万斤。豆饼卖不出去的原因，一方面是因为群众还不习惯用黄豆饼及存在着依赖政府贷放的思想；另一方面则是因为供销合作社未能根据群众经济情况和植棉需要及时组织贷、售，而价格又多次变动，助长了群众的观望心理。现黄豆饼的销售工作已成为该区植棉工作中的严重问题。此外，良棉管理区和石家庄农场的棉籽极受群众欢迎，均已贷放到群众手里，但供销合作社所存棉种，因质量不能满足群众要求、贷放尚成问题。在晋县、平山等地，一般农民顾虑春旱，对完成植棉任务信心不足。
    为了解决这些问题，该专区各县已组织各部门干部下乡，直接领导植棉工作。专区也组织了三十三人的检查团，由专员和中共地方委员会副书记率领，分赴晋县、藁城、获鹿等县检查植棉准备工作，解决各种具体问题，并发扬一九四九年挑水点种的精神，保证天不下雨也要完成今年植棉任务。关于黄豆饼问题，该专区已一面请示上级政府确定处理办法，一面大力组织群众换购、现购及赊购，发动党员，积极分子，劳动模范带头购买。
