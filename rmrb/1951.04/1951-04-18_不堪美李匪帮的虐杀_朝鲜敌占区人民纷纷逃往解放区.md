Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th - The number of people fleeing to liberated areas from the enemy-occupied areas of the southern half of Korea, who are living in dire straits, is increasing daily. They are all accusing the American and Syngman Rhee gangs of their brutal rule and the miserable lives under it.

Park Young-shik, an old farmer from Hengseong County, South Gangwon Province, nearly sixty years old, recently escaped from Chungju, North Chungcheong Province, to the liberated area. In late January, the American troops, fleeing in disarray to the south, forced him and other residents to move south, and set fire to all the houses and piles of rice in the village. The refugees, facing starvation, cold, and the threat of death, walked to Wonju. There, the American and Syngman Rhee troops drove more than two thousand young men and women onto eight freight trains, deceiving them by saying they could continue south by train. At dusk, two American military police ran out of the station and fired dozens of signal flares, followed by several American planes flying over the train and dropping large numbers of gasoline drums, then strafing with rockets and machine guns. Park Young-shik recalled sadly, "In the fire, I saw my grandson calling out for his grandfather as he fell. This was truly the most painful thing in my sixty years. The horrific scene of them struggling in the sea of fire is something I will never forget."

Lee Mo-geun, a resident of Seoul, was forced by the American and Syngman Rhee gangs to flee to Busan when the Korean and Chinese People's Armies approached Seoul last December, where he became a beggar on the streets of Busan. He finally managed to escape to the liberated area. He said, "Today's Busan has become a dark world. Prices are soaring, and the lives of residents are extremely difficult. Refugees forced to flee south by the American and Syngman Rhee gangs are crowding all the streets of the city, on the verge of death." He said, "The people of Busan, living in a living hell, bitterly hate the American and Syngman Rhee gangs and long for early liberation."

People with anger and hunger burning in their hearts have finally risen up in revolt. According to Lee Soo-cheon, a farmer who escaped from Jecheon County, North Chungcheong Province, in mid-February of this year, tens of thousands of residents and refugees in Jecheon County held an uprising. Armed with wooden sticks and iron shovels, they stormed the headquarters of the puppet "Homeland Defense Corps," seized more than twenty rifles, and launched a life-and-death struggle with the American and Syngman Rhee gangs. Although the uprising was ultimately brutally suppressed by the American invading forces, Lee Soo-cheon said: the people have therefore more clearly recognized the brutal face of the American invaders and are ready to rise again at any time.

　　不堪美李匪帮的虐杀
    朝鲜敌占区人民纷纷逃往解放区
    【新华社平壤十七日电】水深火热下的朝鲜南半部敌占区人民，逃来解放区者日益众多。他们纷纷控诉在美、李匪帮血腥统治下的悲惨生活。
    南江原道横城县年近六十的老农民朴永植，最近从忠清北道忠州逃到了解放区。今年一月下旬，狼狈南逃的美军强迫他和其他居民南行，并把全村房屋和稻子堆放火烧毁。难民们在饥寒交迫和死亡的威胁下，步行到原州后，美、李匪军把其中两千多名青年男女赶上八辆载货的火车，欺骗他们说，可以坐火车继续南逃。黄昏时分，两个美国宪兵跑出车站打了数十发信号枪，接着就有几架美国飞机，飞到列车上空，投下大批汽油桶，然后以火箭炮和机枪扫射。朴永植悲痛地回忆说：“在火光中，我看到我的孙儿呼唤着祖父倒下去，这实在是我六十年中最痛心的事。他们在火海里挣扎的惨绝人寰的情景，是我永远不能遗忘的。”
    汉城居民李矛根在去年十二月朝、中人民军队迫近汉城时，被美、李匪帮强迫赶至釜山，在釜山街头沦为乞丐。他最后设法逃到了解放区。他说：“今天的釜山已成黑暗世界，物价暴涨，居民生活极为困苦。被美、李匪帮强迫南逃的难民，挤满了全城各街道，奄奄待毙。”他说：“生活在活地狱中的釜山人民，切齿痛恨美、李匪帮，渴望着早日获得解放。”
    胸中燃烧着愤怒和饥饿的火焰的人民，终于揭竿而起了。据自忠清北道堤川县逃出的农民李洙泉说，今年二月中旬，堤川县数万居民和难民，举行了起义。他们以木棍和铁铣为武器，冲向伪“乡土防卫队”队部，缴获了二十多支步枪，和美、李匪帮展开了生死的斗争。虽然起义最后被美国侵略军残酷地镇压下去。但是，李洙泉说：人民因此更认清了美国侵略者残暴的面目，并随时准备着再起。
