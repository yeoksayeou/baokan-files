    (Twenty-four) The villagers all envied Wang Shan's harvest. Some said, "Next year, we must change to planting some large flower seeds." Wang Shan then told him, "It's okay to plant my seeds next year."
    (Twenty-five) After the autumn harvest, this group's 24.5 mu of cotton fields yielded a total of 5,000 jin of cotton (the best one jin of pure cotton is equivalent to 8.5 jin of millet). The crowd transported the cotton to the cooperative batch after batch to exchange for daily necessities, etc. The villagers all envied them and said, "They are going to get rich!"
    (Twenty-six) After the cotton was delivered to the cooperative, everyone who saw it said it was good. They exchanged it for enough oil, salt, and cloth, and also borrowed a waterwheel, preparing to dig wells early next year, install the waterwheel, plant more cotton, and improve production even more.

    （二十四）村里的人，都羡慕王山的收成。有的说：“明年一定要换些大花籽种。”王山便告诉他：“明年种我的种子好了。”
    （二十五）秋后，他们这一组二十四亩半棉田，共摘了五千斤花（最好的一斤纯花合八斤半小米）。大伙一趟一趟地把棉花送到合作社去换日用物品等。村里的人，都很羡慕地说：“他们要发家了！”
    （二十六）棉花送到合作社后，看到的人都说好。他们换了足够的油、盐、布匹，又贷了一辆水车，准备来年早打井，装水车，多种棉花，把生产搞得更好。（完）
