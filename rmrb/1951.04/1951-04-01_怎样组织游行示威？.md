How to Organize Demonstrations and Parades?
　　Feng Luren

From the end of last October to March 20th of this year, people from all walks of life in more than 400 cities and towns and some rural areas across the country have held patriotic rallies and demonstrations against American aggression and aid to Korea and against the United States arming Japan. The number of people participating in the rallies and demonstrations totaled more than 15 million. Local experiences have proven that holding demonstrations and parades is an effective way to raise the political awareness and enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea General Association has recently called on people in urban and rural areas across the country to hold a demonstration parade as universally as possible on May 1st. The main content is to resist US aggression and aid Korea, oppose arming Japan, and defend world peace. Now, the experiences of organizing anti-American aggression and aid Korea demonstrations in various places are summarized for reference.

How to organize demonstrations and parades?

First, prepare before the demonstration. The first is to carry out current affairs propaganda among the masses of the people, so that the masses of the people understand the principle that everyone is responsible for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and thus actively participate in the demonstration parade. When mobilizing the masses to participate in the parade, organized masses, especially the activists among the masses, should be responsible for mobilizing and organizing scattered masses; at the same time, attention should be paid to mobilizing people with prestige and the more backward people among the masses to participate in the movement in order to expand political influence. Secondly, the local leading organs should prepare slogans and simple and popular leaflets for the conference according to the central content stipulated by the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea General Association and the local specific conditions. These slogans and leaflets must be understood by the people participating in the parade as much as possible. If possible, the masses participating in the parade should also be mobilized to prepare flags, portraits, cartoons, charts, etc. for the parade.

Second, issues to be aware of during the demonstration parade: At the demonstration parade, the local party and government leaders should attend and make reports, briefly and forcefully explaining the significance of the demonstration parade, explaining the specific tasks of the people from all walks of life in the anti-American aggression and aid Korea movement, and reviewing the parade team. The leading organs should also organize other people who have not participated in the parade to set up agitation stations, tea stations, etc., to inspire the patriotic enthusiasm of the parading masses.

Third, the work to be done after the demonstration parade: After the parade, local leading organs should promote various groups to summarize the experience of this demonstration parade. Through the summary, earnestly implement the central political requirements of the movement, and never be satisfied with the enthusiasm of one parade. We must strike while the iron is hot and work in depth. For example, carry out patriotic production competitions among workers and peasants, and carry out a non-tax evasion movement among business circles, etc. In short, after the parade, organize various patriotic actions of the masses from all walks of life to expand the results of the movement.

Local experiences have proven that wherever attention is paid to the above-mentioned issues, the parade appears particularly enthusiastic and the effect is very good; conversely, not only will it not be possible to organize an enthusiastic parade, but also the development of the movement will be affected. The 660,000-strong workers' parade held in Shanghai on March 4th maintained its majestic and orderly formation throughout the parade because it paid attention to these issues. After the parade, the workers' patriotic production enthusiasm became even higher. Workers in many factories returned and formulated production plans, determined to continue to demonstrate to American imperialism with brilliant production achievements. A driver from the British-owned tram company said: "This grand parade made me more aware of the greatness of the working class. I guarantee that I will not leave work or take unwarranted leave in my future production posts." The women's circles in Wuhan held a parade of 46,000 people on January 14th. Because the mobilization work was done well, from female workers and female soldiers to nuns and monks, from seventy-year-old women to children, all participated in the parade. The parade was more enthusiastic than other social groups. No one left early from beginning to end of the parade. The general response after the parade was very good, believing that "women are truly liberated and have stood up." Through the parade, various districts organized and contacted the masses more extensively and improved the political awareness of women. Housewives said: "We must expand the love for our families to love for our country." The old nun said: "I haven't been so happy in decades." At the end of the parade, many women greeted each other: "Sisters! Let's meet at the Women's Federation later!" On the other hand, the parade demonstration held by the business community in Taiyuan on December 11th last year did not achieve great results because the organizational work was not done well in advance, there was no ideological mobilization, and the conference was held by simply assigning the number of people. There was no discussion after the meeting, so the effect was not great. Some people did not even know the content of the patriotic pact after the parade, and some did not even know the content of the meeting. The local leading organs later discovered this situation and re-launched publicity work in various industries. However, this lesson should arouse the vigilance of all places.

　　怎样组织游行示威？
    冯鲁仁
    由去年十月底到今年三月二十日为止，全国已有四百多个城镇和部分乡村的各阶层人民举行了抗美援朝反对美国武装日本的爱国集会和示威游行，参加集会游行的人数共达一千五百万以上。各地经验证明：举行游行示威，是提高人民群众政治认识和热情的有效办法。因此，最近抗美援朝总会特号召全国城乡人民在五一节尽可能普遍地举行一次示威游行，主要的内容是抗美援朝，反对武装日本和保卫世界和平。现在把各地组织抗美援朝示威游行的经验整理出来，以供各地参考。
    要怎样组织游行示威呢？
    第一，举行示威以前要有准备。首先是要在人民群众中展开时事宣传，使人民群众懂得抗美援朝人人有责的道理，因而积极参加示威游行。在发动群众参加游行时，要通过有组织的群众特别是群众中的积极分子分头负责动员组织分散的群众；同时，要注意发动在群众中有声望的人物和较落后的人参加到运动中来，以便扩大政治影响。其次是当地领导机关要根据抗美援朝总会规定的中心内容和当地的具体情况，准备好大会用的口号和简明通俗的传单，这些口号、传单须尽量让参加游行的人了解其意义。如果可能时，还应动员参加游行的群众准备好游行用的旗子、像片、漫画、图表等等。
    第二，示威游行时应注意的问题：在游行示威大会上，当地党的和政府的首长应出席作报告，简短有力地说明游行示威的意义，说明各界人民在抗美援朝运动中的具体任务，并检阅游行队伍。领导机关并应组织其他未参加游行的人民设立鼓动站，茶水站等，以鼓舞游行的群众的爱国热情。
    第三，示威游行以后应进行的工作：游行后，各地领导机关应推动各团体总结这次示威游行的经验，通过总结，认真贯彻运动的中心政治要求，决不要满足于一次游行的热烈，必须趁热打铁，深入工作。如在工人、农民中开展爱国主义生产竞赛，在工商界中开展不漏税运动等等。总之，要在游行后，组织各界群众的各项爱国行动，来扩大运动的成果。
    各地的经验已经证明，凡注意到上述这些问题的，游行显得格外热烈，效果也很好；反之，不但不能组织热烈的游行，并且使运动的开展也受到影响。上海市在三月四日举行的六十六万工人大游行，由于注意了这些问题，游行队伍始终保持雄伟整齐。游行后，工人们的爱国生产热情更趋高涨，许多厂的工人回去后即订立生产计划，决心以光辉的生产成绩继续向美帝国主义示威。英商电车公司一位司机说：“这次大游行，使我更认识到工人阶级力量的伟大，我保证在今后的生产岗位上不脱班，不无故请假。”武汉市妇女界在一月十四日举行的四万六千人大游行，因为动员工作做得好，从女工，女战士到尼姑、修道，从七十岁的老妪到小孩都参加了游行。游行盛况较其他阶层更为热烈。参加游行的，自始至终，无一人早退。游行后，一般反映甚好，认为“妇女真正解放了，站起来了”。通过游行，各区更广泛地组织与联系了群众，提高了妇女界的政治觉悟。家庭妇女说：“要把爱护家庭的心扩大到爱国上去。”老尼姑说：“几十年来没有这样快活过。”游行结束时，许多妇女互相招呼：“姐妹们！以后在妇联见面呀！”在另一方面，太原市工商界去年十二月十一日举行的游行示威，由于事先组织工作没有做好，没有经过思想动员，用简单分配人数的方式召开大会，会后也没有展开讨论，以致效果不大。有的人游行后连爱国公约的内容也不知道，有的人甚至连开会的内容也不知道。当地领导机关后来已发现这种情况，并在各行各业中重新进行宣传工作。但是这个教训却是应该引起各地警惕的。
