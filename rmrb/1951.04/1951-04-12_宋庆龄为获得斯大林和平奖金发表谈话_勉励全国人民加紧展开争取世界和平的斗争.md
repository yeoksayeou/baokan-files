Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 11th—Song Qingling, President of the China Welfare Institute, issued the following statement here on the 10th regarding receiving the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Peace Prize:

　　I feel infinitely honored to be listed as one of the recipients of the Stalin Peace Prize. To be associated with the struggle to defend peace and with the name of Stalin is a special honor, because peace is what all the people of the world need most, and the name of Stalin is most representative of peace.

　　I accept this highest honor as a representative of the Chinese people. Through persistent revolutionary struggle, the Chinese people have placed the strength of our entire nation on the side of defending peace. The victory of the Chinese people, combined with the victory of the Soviet people in socialism, and the courageous advance and unwavering determination of all other progressive elements, has changed the world situation forever in favor of peace and the rule of the people.

　　Today, this united front of the people of the world is unfolding the struggle to defend peace at the most powerful pace. The American plutocratic warmongers and their lackeys, defiling the words "peace," are engaging in aggression under the pretext of peace, and they have suffered repeated and serious defeats. As a result, they are going mad. They are cruelly destroying all peaceful construction, turning the achievements of the brave Korean people into ashes. In Korea, Malaya, and other parts of the world, they bestially separate mothers and children, or kill them all. They want to subject all mankind to their plunder and exploitation, reducing them to slaves and cannon fodder, as they are currently doing in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan. However, their evil purpose will never be achieved, because the united front of the people of the world to defend peace has its own special strength. As the World Peace Council has shown, there is no region in the world without representatives participating in this struggle to "strengthen international peace."

　　Therefore, let us take this opportunity of the presentation of the Stalin Peace Prize to reiterate our determination to fight for the defense of world peace. Let us gather new strength, be further encouraged to overcome the enemies of mankind, and create the incomparably bright future of peaceful work and happy life that mankind deserves. Let us unite and shout in unison:

　　Long live Stalin, the leader of the world's people in the struggle for peace!

　　Long live all the forces of peace in the world!

　　Long live world peace!

　　宋庆龄为获得斯大林和平奖金发表谈话
  　勉励全国人民加紧展开争取世界和平的斗争
    【新华社上海十一日电】中国人民救济总会主席宋庆龄为获得“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金于十日在此间发表谈话如下：
    我被列名为斯大林和平奖金获奖人之一，感觉无限的荣幸。能够和保卫和平的斗争、和斯大林的名字连在一起，这是一个特殊的光荣。因为和平是全世界人民所最需要的。而斯大林的名字是最能代表和平的。
    我是以中国人民的一个代表来接受这个最高的荣誉的。中国人民经过了坚持不懈的革命斗争，已经把我们全国的力量放在保卫和平的一边。中国人民的胜利，配合着苏联人民在社会主义方面的胜利，以及其他一切进步分子的勇敢前进与坚定不移，已经使世界形势的改变，永远有利于和平与人民的统治。
    这个全世界人民的统一战线，今天正以最有力的步调展开保卫和平的斗争。美国的财阀战贩及其仆从们，玷污着“和平”这两个字，借口为和平而进行侵略，他们接连遭到严重失败。结果他们发疯了。他们残酷地毁坏一切和平的建设，把勇敢的朝鲜人民的建设成就变成灰烬。他们在朝鲜、马来亚以及世界其他地方，兽性地使母子骨肉分离，或者把他们都杀害了。他们要把全人类都供其掠夺剥削，沦为奴隶，作为炮灰，正如他们目前在美国国内、西欧与日本所干的一样。然而，他们这种罪恶的目的，决不能达到，因为世界人民保卫和平的统一战线，自有其特殊的力量。我们亿万人民坚决团结起来，反对那极少数的人，正如世界和平理事会所表明的，世界上没有一个地区没有代表参加这个“加强国际和平”的斗争。
    因此，让我们趁着斯大林和平奖金颁发的机会，再一次重申我们为保卫世界和平而斗争的决心。让我们集合起新的力量，更加鼓舞起来战胜人类的敌人，创造人类应该获得的和平工作与愉快生活的无比光明的前途。让我们联合起来，齐声高呼：
    世界人民争取和平的领导者斯大林万岁！
    世界一切的和平力量万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
