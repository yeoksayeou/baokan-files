　　The Sixteen Soviet Republics That Completed the Post-War Five-Year Plan (Part 2)
    Li He
  Kazakh Republic
    Kazakhstan borders the Ili, Tarbagatai, and Altai districts of Xinjiang Province in China. Under the Soviet regime, Kazakhstan has become a republic with developed heavy industry. In 1940, the total output of large-scale industry exceeded 22.2 times that of 1913. In 1949, the total industrial output exceeded that before the war by one time. The power generation capacity in 1949 had reached the level of 1950, equivalent to 300 times that of 1913. Now Kazakhstan's power generation capacity is almost equal to the national electricity of Tsarist Russia.
    During the post-war five years, labor productivity has been greatly improved. In 1949, the average annual output of each worker increased by 24.4 percent compared with 1940. From 1946 to 1949, the average wage increased by 59.7 percent.
    In agriculture, the existing cultivated land area is more than one and a half times that of 1913. The harvests of rice, sorghum, sugar beet, and tobacco maintain world records. By the end of last year, 4,500 collective farms had been merged into 1,670 large collective farms. Last year, the collective farmers paid the state more than 45 million poods of grain, exceeding 1940.
    Kazakhstan is the livestock breeding base in the east of the Soviet Union. Since 1933, the number of livestock has increased sixfold. The five-year plan for breeding livestock was completed ahead of schedule in 1949.
    Compared with 1945, the number of cattle in collective farms increased by 47 percent, horses by 91 percent, sheep and goats by one time, and pigs by four times. The number of "millionaire collective farms" increased fivefold compared with 1940. Kazakhstan now has 9,000 schools, 105 secondary technical schools, and 26 institutions of higher learning.
  Kyrgyz Republic
    Kyrgyzstan is a small country bordering the Aksu district of Xinjiang Province in China. The Tianshan Mountains account for most of the republic's 196,900 square kilometers. The foothills and valleys have good pastures, so livestock breeding has become the main sector of agriculture. In the past 15 years, the number of fine breeds of horses, fine-wool sheep, and pigs in the republic has increased more than fifteenfold. Artificial irrigation is practiced in the northern and western regions, and agriculture is well-developed. The cultivated area of grain has doubled compared with 1913, and the area of technical crops has tripled. More than two-thirds of farmland cultivation has been mechanized. The republic's original 559 collective farms have been merged into 230 large collective farms. The number of "millionaire collective farms" has increased eightfold compared with before the war.
    Before the revolution, Kyrgyzstan had almost no industry. At present, industry accounts for more than 70 percent of the national economy. In 1950, industrial output doubled compared with 1940. Electricity production increased 164 times in 25 years.
    During the Soviet regime, Kyrgyzstan created its own national script, eliminated illiteracy, and implemented universal seven-year education in rural areas and ten-year education in cities. In this country with a population of just over 1.5 million, there are now 1,650 schools with 330,000 students; 8 institutions of higher learning and 34 secondary technical schools with 13,500 students.
  Tajik Republic
    Tajikistan, which had almost no industry before the revolution, developed industry during the Stalin Five-Year Plans. In the capital, Stalinabad, there is a huge cotton textile mill, and in Leninabad there is a silk weaving mill. Tajikistan has also established oil, coal, rare metal mines, and power stations. After the war, industry continued to develop, especially in mining, textiles, and fruit canning.
    Tajikistan completed its five-year plan for cotton production in 1948. In terms of total cotton production, Tajikistan ranks second in the Soviet Union. The production of livestock, fruits, and grapes has exceeded the pre-set goals of the post-war five-year plan. On January 1, 1950, the republic had 300 "millionaire collective farms," an increase of 177 compared with 1948.
    Tajikistan, with a population of 1.5 million, now has 3,000 schools with 300,000 students. There are 13,000 students in nine institutions of higher learning, thirty technical schools, and normal schools. In the past three years, 500 primary and secondary school buildings have been built.
  Turkmen Republic
    The Turkmen Republic is located in the southernmost part of the Soviet Union, and three-quarters of its territory is desert. The entire republic has a population of 1.25 million, scattered in fertile irrigated areas in the desert. Under the Soviet system, Turkmenistan has changed from a backward border area to a prosperous land of economy and culture.
    Industry occupies a major position in the national economy. Under the Soviet system, oil extraction, oil refining, chemical, building materials, textile, sewing, printing, food, and cheese industries have been established. The total industrial output in 1949 greatly exceeded the pre-war level. The oil industry developed particularly rapidly, completing the five-year plan in just three years.
    The main sector of agriculture is cotton planting. The hot climate and irrigated land are suitable for producing good long-staple cotton. In the past few years after the war, new irrigated land has been expanded, and the cotton planting industry has achieved further development. After the Turkmen Grand Canal is completed, the cotton harvest will increase eightfold. On the pastures of the Kara-Kum Desert, livestock, especially the breeding of Astrakhan sheep, is very developed.
    Turkmenistan has completely eliminated illiteracy and is implementing seven-year universal education. The National University was established in 1950.
  Moldavian Republic
    Moldavia is the most densely populated republic in the Soviet Union: 2.7 million people live on 33,400 square kilometers of land.
    During the post-war five-year plan, Moldavia established more than 600 factories. As early as 1948, industrial production had exceeded the pre-war level by 18.9 percent. Moldavia is now one of the largest food industry regions in the Soviet Union. Light industry, metal appliance manufacturing, and woodworking manufacturing have also been developed. The number of employees has increased one and a half times compared with before the war.
    Moldavian industry mainly processes agricultural products. The fertile land of the republic produces grapes, fruits, corn, and wheat. Bessarabia, the western region of Moldavia that only returned to the Soviet Union before the war, achieved agricultural collectivization from 1949 to the spring of 1950. More than 96 percent of poor and middle peasants have joined collective farms. The republic had 108 machine tractor stations in 1950. The original 657 collective farms have been merged into 301 large collective farms. In the past four years, 229 power stations have been built in rural areas.
    Ten years ago, illiteracy in the western region accounted for three-quarters of the population, but now illiteracy has been eliminated. This year, more than 400,000 students are studying in more than 1,900 schools, and 15,000 students are studying in eight institutions of higher learning and thirty-eight secondary technical schools. The Moldavian branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences leads fourteen scientific research institutes.
  Lithuanian Republic
    There are three republics along the Baltic Sea: Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.
    During the post-war five-year plan, the Lithuanian Republic established many new enterprises, and the number of workers has more than doubled compared with before the war. In 1949, the total industrial output exceeded 67 percent of the pre-war level; in 1950, it exceeded 26 percent of 1949. The proportion of industry in the national economy was 34.9 percent in 1945, and rose to 51.8 percent in 1950.
    Lithuania established Soviet power in 1940. After the war, more than 90 percent of collective farmers have joined collective farms. 113 machine tractor stations have now been established, increasing 14,000 various agricultural machines in the four years after the war. In 1950 alone, 1,800 tractors were added. As early as 1949, the harvest of young collective farms was on average 15 to 20 percent higher than that of individual peasant economies. At present, Lithuania's original 4,122 collective farms have been merged into 1,560 large collective farms.
    The republic implements seven-year universal education. The republic with a population of 3 million has 4,000 primary, seven-year, and secondary schools with 459,000 students, 12 institutions of higher learning, and the number of university students is three times that of before the war.
  Latvian Republic
    Before the establishment of Soviet power in Latvia in 1940, it was an agricultural appendage of Western European imperialism. In 1929, foreign capital accounted for 52 percent of the timber industry, 55 percent of the paper industry, 69 percent of the textile industry, and 85 percent of the chemical industry. Latvia was subjected to the destruction of the Hitler gang only one year after the establishment of Soviet power. The recovery and development of its national economy began after the re-liberation in May 1945.
    Latvian industry has risen step by step in the post-war five years. If the total industrial output in 1945 is 100, then it was 180 in 1946, 270 in 1947, 380 in 1948, 507 in 1949, and about 600 in 1950. The industrial output prescribed by the post-war five-year plan was completed in three years and nine months. In 1949, industrial output exceeded the pre-war level by more than one time; in 1950, it exceeded 23 percent of 1949. The average monthly industrial output in 1950 was three times that of before the war. The industrial sectors that manufacture production tools, such as metal manufacturing and machine manufacturing, have been particularly developed after the war.
    Huge changes have taken place in the Latvian countryside after the war. In 1949, the complete collectivization of agriculture was completed. By this spring, the republic with an area of 64,500 square kilometers had established 100 machine tractor stations. In 1950, tractor horsepower increased sevenfold compared with 1945, and the amount of tractor work increased fourteenfold.
    The republic's original 4,118 collective farms have been merged into 1,827 large collective farms. Many large collective farms are undergoing the construction of agricultural towns.
    Latvia implements seven-year universal education. This year, 282,000 students are studying in 1,550 schools.
  Estonian Republic
    Before the establishment of Soviet power in the Estonian Republic in 1940, it was a semi-colony plundered by American imperialism. After the war, the national economy developed rapidly. Estonia is a famous shale producing area. After the war, shale production exceeded one time that of before the war. The world's largest shale gas manufacturing plant was established in the republic. In 1948, industrial production exceeded the pre-war level. In 1950, industrial output was three times that of before the war and four times that of 1945; among them, the production of generators increased one time compared with 1945, and the production of cotton textiles increased thirty times compared with 1945.
    Now 90 percent of farmers in Estonia have joined collective farms. The cultivated land of collective farms and state farms accounts for 95 percent of the total cultivated land area. There are a total of 56 machine tractor stations in the republic. In the five years after the war, the amount of tractor work increased twentyfold. Livestock breeding has also developed greatly: in 1950, cattle increased by 40 percent, horses by 21 percent, pigs by 75 percent, and goats and sheep by 54 percent.
    Estonia has opened 111 schools in the past four years. Most of the forty-eight secondary technical schools and specialized schools were established after the war. There are now eight institutions of higher learning.
  Karelo-Finnish Republic
    When the Karelo-Finnish Republic was just liberated from fascist occupation, the level of industrial production was 80 percent lower than in 1940. By 1949, the total industrial output had exceeded the pre-war level of 1940; in 1950, it exceeded 18 percent of 1949. The most important sectors of the national economy—the timber industry and the paper industry—have greatly developed. Timber harvesting has increased tenfold. In the past two years alone, the number of electric saws has increased 3.5 times, power stations have increased three times, tree-felling tractors have increased about six times, and locomotives have increased three times. The production of paper, paper fiber, and paper bags (for packing cement and other building materials) has long exceeded pre-war levels. The output of the largest Schigzhi Paper Factory in Europe has greatly increased. The republic has established many factories and hydroelectric power stations after the war. The White Sea-Baltic Canal, which was destroyed by the German bandits, has been restored. New cities, factories, and villages have appeared on both sides of the canal.
    Good crops are now growing on land that was previously considered unsuitable for cultivation. The entire republic has thirty machine tractor stations. The republic has eliminated illiteracy. There are now 77,000 students studying in 700 primary and secondary schools.

　　完成了战后五年计划的苏联十六个加盟共和国（下）
    李何
  哈萨克共和国
    哈萨克与我国新疆省伊犁、塔城、阿山三区交界。在苏维埃政权下，哈萨克已成为一个重工业发达的共和国。一九四○年大工业总产量超过一九一三年的二十二点二倍，一九四九年工业总产量超过战前一倍。发电能力在一九四九年已达到一九五○年的水平，相当于一九一三年的三百倍。现在哈萨克的发电能力，几等于沙皇俄国时代全国的电力。
    在战后五年中，劳动生产率已大大提高，一九四九年平均每个工人的一年生产量比一九四○年增加了百分之二十四点四。一九四六到一九四九年中，平均工资增加了五十九点七。
    在农业方面，现有的耕地面积，相当于一九一三年的一倍半以上。稻、高粱、甜菜和烟草的收成保持着世界纪录。截至去年年底止，已有四千五百个集体农场合并为一千六百七十个大集体农场。集体农民去年向国家缴纳的谷物超过一九四○年四千五百万普特。
    哈萨克是苏联东方的牲畜饲养业基地，自一九三三年以来，家畜头数增加了六倍。繁殖牲畜的五年计划已于一九四九年提前完成。
    与一九四五年相较，集体农场的牛增加了百分之四十七，马——百分之九十一，绵羊山羊——一倍，猪——四倍。“百万集体农场”的数目比一九四○年增加了五倍。哈萨克现有九千所学校、一百零五所中等技术学校、二十六所高等学校。
  吉尔吉斯共和国
    吉尔吉斯是一个小国，与我国新疆省阿克苏区交界，天山山脉占了共和国十九万六千九百平方公里的面积的大部分。山麓和山谷都有很好的牧场，因此牲畜饲养业成为农业的主要部门。在最近十五年间，共和国的优良品种的马匹、细毛绵羊和猪的头数增加了十五倍以上。北部和西部地区经过人工灌溉，农业十分发达。谷物耕地面积比一九一三年增加了一倍，技术作物面积增加了三倍。农田耕耘工作已有三分之二以上实行机械化。共和国原有的五百五十九个集体农场已合并为二百三十个大集体农场，“百万集体农场”的数目已比战前增加了八倍。
    革命前，吉尔吉斯几乎完全没有工业，目前工业在国民经济中的比重已超过了百分之七十。一九五○年工业产量比一九四○年增加了一倍。电力生产在二十五年中增加了一百六十四倍。
    吉尔吉斯在苏维埃政权时代创造了本民族的文字，消灭了文盲，实行了乡村七年制、城市十年制的普遍教育。在这人口不过一百五十万的国度里，现有一千六百五十所学校，学生三十三万人；八所高等学校和三十四所中等技术学校，学生一万三千五百人。
  塔吉克共和国
    革命前几乎没有工业的塔吉克，在斯大林五年计划年代中已发展了工业。在首都斯大林阿巴德有巨大棉织厂，在列宁阿巴德有丝织厂。塔吉克并建立了石油、煤、稀有金属矿场和电力站。战后工业继续发展着，特别是采矿、纺织和水果罐头等部门。
    塔吉克在一九四八年已经完成了产棉的五年计划。就产棉总量来说，塔吉克占全苏第二位。饲畜、水果、葡萄的生产都超过了战后五年计划的预定目标。一九五○年一月一日，共和国已有三百个“百万集体农场”，较一九四八年增加了一百七十七个。
    一百五十万人口的塔吉克现有三千所学校，学生三十万人。在九所高等学校、三十所技术学校和师范学校内学生共一万三千人。最近三年间已建筑了五百座中小学校舍。
  土库曼共和国
    土库曼共和国位于苏联国境的最南面，国土有四分之三是沙漠。全共和国一百二十五万人口，散居在沙漠中经过灌溉的肥沃地带。在苏维埃制度下，土库曼已由落后的边疆变成经济与文化繁荣的国土了。
    工业在国民经济中占主要地位。在苏维埃制度下建立了石油开采、石油提炼、化学、建筑器材、纺织、缝纫、印刷、食品和乳酪等工业部门。工业总产量在一九四九年已大大超过战前水平，石油工业发展得特别快，战后三年中就完成了五年计划的任务。
    农业的主要部门是植棉，炎热的气候和灌溉过的土地，都宜于生产长纤维的好棉花。战后几年间扩大了新的灌溉土地，植棉事业获得更进一步的发展。土库曼大运河将来竣工后，棉花收成将要增加八倍。在卡拉·库姆沙漠的牧场上，牲畜，特别是阿斯特拉罕种羊的饲养业非常发达。
    土库曼已完全消灭了文盲，实施着七年普及教育。一九五○年已建立了国立大学。
  摩尔达维亚共和国
    摩尔达维亚在苏联是人口最稠密的共和国：三万三千四百平方公里的土地上居住着二百七十万人民。
    摩尔达维亚在战后五年计划期间建立了六百多座工厂。还在一九四八年，工业生产量已超过战前水平的百分之十八点九。摩尔达维亚现在是苏联最大的食品工业区之一。也已发展了轻工业、金属器具制造业和木器制造业。职工人数比战前增加了一倍半。
    摩尔达维亚工业主要是对农业品的加工。在共和国肥沃的土地上出产着葡萄、水果、玉蜀黍、小麦。战前才回到苏联来的摩尔达维亚西部地区比萨拉比亚，从一九四九年到一九五零年春季实现了农业集体化。百分之九十六以上的贫农和中农已参加集体农场。共和国一九五○年已有一百零八个机器拖拉机站。原有的六百五十七个集体农场已合并为三百零一个大集体农场。最近四年中在乡村建筑了二百二十九个电力站。
    十年前西部地区的文盲占人口四分之三，现在文盲已经消灭。今年有四十多万学生在一千九百多所学校学习，一万五千学生在八所高等学校和三十八所中等技术学校学习。苏联科学院摩尔达维亚分院领导着十四个科学研究所。
  立陶宛共和国
    波罗的海沿岸有三个加盟共和国：立陶宛、拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚。
    立陶宛共和国在战后五年计划期间建立了许多新的企业，工人数目比战前增加了一倍多。一九四九年工业总产量已超过战前百分之六十七；一九五零年又超过一九四九年的百分之二十六。工业在国民经济中的比重，一九四五年是百分之三四点九，一九五零年上升到百分之五一点八。
    立陶宛在一九四零年建立起苏维埃政权，战后百分之九十以上集体农民已参加了集体农场。现在已建立了一百一十三个机器拖拉机站，在战后四年中增加了一万四千架各种农业机器。仅在一九五零年就增加了一千八百架拖拉机。还在一九四九年，年青的集体农场的收成已比个体农民经济收成平均高出了百分之十五至二十。目前立陶宛原有的四千一百二十二个集体农场已合并成一千五百六十个大集体农场。
    共和国实行了七年普遍教育。人口三百万的共和国有初等、七年制和中等学校四千所，学生四十五万九千人，高等学校十二所，大学生人数为战前的三倍。
  拉脱维亚共和国
    拉脱维亚在一九四零年建立苏维埃政权以前，是西欧帝国主义的农业附庸国。一九二九年外国资本在木材工业方面占百分之五十二，在造纸业方面占百分之五十五，在纺织业方面占百分之六十九，在化学业方面占百分之八十五。拉脱维亚建立苏维埃政权才一年，又受到希特勒匪帮的破坏。它的国民经济的恢复与发展，是一九四五年五月重新解放以后的事。
    拉脱维亚工业在战后五年中，步步上升。如以一九四五年工业总产量为一百，那么一九四六年为一八○，一九四七年为二七○，一九四八年为三八○，一九四九年为五○七，一九五零年约为六○○。战后五年计划规定的工业产量，在三年零九个月中就已完成了。一九四九年工业产量已超过战前水平一倍以上；一九五零年又超过一九四九年百分之二十三。一九五零年工业产量平均每月为战前三倍。战后特别发达的是制造生产工具的工业部门，如五金制造业、机器制造业等。
    战后拉脱维亚农村发生了巨大的变化。一九四九年已完成了农业的完全集体化。到今年春天，面积六万四千五百平方公里的共和国，已建立了一百个机器拖拉机站。一九五零年拖拉机马力比一九四五年增加了七倍，拖拉机的工作量增加了十四倍。
    共和国原有的四千一百一十八个集体农场已合并成一千八百二十七个大集体农场。许多大集体农场正进行着农业城镇的建设。
    拉脱维亚实行七年普遍教育。今年有二十八万二千学生在一千五百五十所学校学习。
  爱沙尼亚共和国
    爱沙尼亚共和国在一九四零年建立苏维埃政权以前，是为美国帝国主义所劫掠的半殖民地。战后国民经济才迅速地发展起来。爱沙尼亚是有名的页岩的产地。战后页岩产量超过了战前的一倍。在共和国建立了世界最大的页岩煤气制造厂。一九四八年工业生产已超过战前水平。一九五零年的工业产量为战前的三倍，为一九四五年的四倍；其中发电机的生产比一九四五年增加了一倍，棉织品的生产比一九四五年增加了三十倍。
    爱沙尼亚现在已有百分之九十的农民参加了集体农场。集体农场和国家农场的耕地，占全部耕地面积百分之九十五。共和国共有五十六个机器拖拉机站。战后五年中拖拉机的工作量增加了二十倍。牲畜饲养业也有很大发展：一九五零年牛增加了百分之四十，马——百分之二十一，猪——百分之七十五，山羊和绵羊——百分之五十四。
    爱沙尼亚最近四年来开办了一百一十一所学校。在四十八所中等技术学校和专门学校中，大部分是战后建立起来的。高等学校现在有八所。
  卡累利阿—芬兰共和国
    卡累利阿—芬兰刚从法西斯占领下解放出来的时候，工业生产水平低于一九四零年百分之八十。到了一九四九年工业总产量已超过战前一九四零年的水平；一九五零年又超过一九四九年的百分之十八。国民经济中最重要的部门——木材工业和造纸工业已大大发展。木材采伐量增加了十倍。仅在最近两年中，电锯数目增加了三点五倍，电力站增加三倍，摧树拖拉机增加约六倍，火车头增加三倍。纸、纸纤维、纸袋（装水泥等建筑材料用）的生产早已超过战前。全欧最大的施格志造纸工厂的产量大大增加了。共和国战后建立了许多工厂和水电站。恢复了被德寇破坏了的白海—波罗的海运河。在运河两岸出现了新的城市、工厂和乡村。
    在以前被认为不宜耕种的土地上，现在正长着很好的庄稼。全共和国已有三十个机器拖拉机站。共和国已经消灭了文盲。现有七万七千名学生在七百所中小学校学习。
