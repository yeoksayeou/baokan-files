Chongqing Catholics and Christians Hold Joint Meeting
　Accuse Imperialist Elements of Harming Our People

Participants demanded that the government severely punish Song Bohua, who harmed more than 300 Chinese children, and Sha Shuming, who engaged in espionage activities and oppressed workers.

Chongqing Catholics and Christians jointly held a meeting on April 15 to accuse imperialist elements of their crimes. More than 1,000 representatives from various church groups attended the meeting. The chairman of the meeting, Lu Guangting, district leader of the Chongqing District of the Christian Methodist Church, pointed out in his speech: It is the responsibility of every Christian to oppose imperialism's use of religion to undermine our motherland and endanger our people. The purpose of our accusation meeting today is to raise the awareness of Christians and resolutely fight against imperialist elements.

At the meeting, Huang Kaiming, Wang Shiying, Chen Guanghui, and others, orphaned girls who escaped from the Shapingba Nursery, which was run by the Tianzhujiao Zhenyuan Church system, Tang Junbai, a worker from the Ren'ai Tang Hospital, which was also run by Catholics, and more than 20 other Christians, angrily accused imperialist elements within the church of their crimes.

Huang Kaiming accused Song Bohua (a French national), the director of the Catholic Nursery, of the monstrous crime of harming more than 300 Chinese babies. She said: "Song Bohua confined the babies who entered the nursery in a small and humid room and handed them over to disabled orphaned girls to care for. The babies' food was controlled by Song Bohua. Two-year-old babies ate thin porridge and vegetable roots. One-year-old children ate rice soup. Many babies died of indigestion. Song Bohua and all the foreigners drank well water, but the Chinese babies, orphaned girls, and workers had to drink pool water that was often used for washing clothes and toilets. Some babies died of diarrhea, dysentery, and rectal prolapse after drinking the dirty water. Song Bohua only studied nursing for a few years and then served as the hospital's doctor. When she saw children, she didn't diagnose or prescribe medicine, but randomly used drugs for experiments, so many children died on the same day after taking the medicine. During the five years that Song Bohua was the director, the hospital adopted a total of 408 babies, of which 300 were harmed to death, with a mortality rate of more than 73 percent. After the liberation of Chongqing, Song Bohua continued to adopt 31 babies. Of these 31 babies, 29 have now died, and the remaining two blind children have also been fostered in other people's homes."

Huang Kaiming's accusation aroused great anger among all the Christians present. They unanimously shouted: "We request the People's Government to punish the murderer Song Bohua and avenge the more than 300 babies who died tragically!" When Wang Shiying, Chen Guanghui, and others read out their request to the People's Government to take over the nursery, the audience applauded thunderously, and more than a thousand Christians present shouted in unison: "Support!"

Tang Junbai, a worker at Ren'ai Tang Hospital, accused Sha Shuming, a French nun at the hospital, of engaging in espionage activities and oppressing the hospital's employees. He read out the request unanimously passed by all the employees of the hospital to the government to take over Ren'ai Tang Hospital, and accused Sha Shuming of her crimes, saying: Sha Shuming hid a transceiver, a military telephone, an American naval waist knife, and various reactionary books published in Hong Kong in the convent (the above items have been confiscated by the Chongqing Municipal Public Security Bureau after being reported by the hospital's employees). She often used the excuse of going to the countryside to treat illnesses to spread rumors everywhere. In the hospital, she often beat and scolded workers, and sometimes even forced workers to work for 23 hours a day, and did not allow female workers to have children. She also fired three workers for no reason, one of whom had worked in the hospital for 30 years. After liberation, Sha Shuming forbade workers from participating in trade union activities.

At this accusation meeting, Catholic nurse Tang Zhengyu, Lu Guangting, district leader of the Chongqing District of the Christian Methodist Church, and Zhao Mingxue, a disciple of the Sabbath Church, successively accused imperialist elements within the church of various crimes.

Finally, the representatives unanimously passed a resolution, making the following demands to the People's Government: severely punish imperialist elements Song Bohua, Sha Shuming, and others, establish a committee including people from all walks of life to investigate the crimes of imperialist elements in the nursery who harmed Chinese babies, and take over the nursery and Ren'ai Tang Hospital.

The Chongqing Municipal People's Government has now accepted the opinions of the representatives attending the meeting, established an investigation committee, and is actively carrying out investigations and handling the matter.

　　重庆天主教徒、基督教徒联合集会
　  控诉帝国主义分子残害我国人民罪行
    与会者要求政府严办残害我国儿童三百余名的宋伯华和进行间谍活动压迫职工的沙淑明
    重庆市天主教徒、基督教徒于四月十五日联合举行控诉帝国主义分子罪行大会。到会各教会团体代表一千余人。大会主席、基督教卫理公会重庆教区区长陆光廷在致词中指出：反对帝国主义利用宗教破坏我们祖国、危害我国人民，是每个教徒的责任。我们今天开控诉大会，就是要提高教徒的觉悟，坚决与帝国主义分子作斗争。
    会上，有从天主教真元堂教会系统主办的沙坪坝育婴院逃出来的孤女黄开明、汪世英、陈光惠等和天主教主办的仁爱堂医院的工友唐俊柏以及教徒等二十余人，愤怒地控诉了教会内帝国主义分子的罪行。
    黄开明控诉天主教育婴院院长宋伯华（法籍）残害三百余中国婴儿的滔天罪行，她说：“宋伯华将进院婴儿关在一间狭小而又潮湿的屋子里，交给身体残废的孤女照护。婴儿们的食物统由宋伯华支配。两岁的婴儿吃稀饭和菜根。一周岁的幼儿吃米浆汤。许多婴儿都患消化不良症死了。宋伯华及所有的外国人吃井水，却要中国婴儿、孤女、工人吃经常洗衣服、洗马桶用的池水。有些婴儿就是吃了脏水患腹泻、痢疾、脱肛等病死的。宋伯华只学过几年护士，便兼任院内医生。她给孩子看病时，不诊断也不开方，乱用药品试验，因而很多小孩吃了药当天就死了。宋伯华当院长的五年中，全院共收养四百零八名婴儿，其中三百名被残害死了，死亡率达百分之七十三以上。重庆解放后，宋伯华继续收养了婴儿三十一名。这三十一个婴儿中现在已死了二十九名，剩下两个瞎眼的也寄养到别人家里去了。”
    黄开明的控诉，激起了与会全体教徒的极大愤怒。他们一致高呼：“请求人民政府惩办杀人凶手宋伯华，为惨死的三百多个婴儿申冤复仇！”汪世英、陈光惠等宣读她们请求人民政府接管育婴院的请求书时，全场掌声如雷，千余与会教徒齐声高呼：“拥护！”
    仁爱堂医院工友唐俊柏控诉了该院法籍修道女沙淑明进行间谍活动和压迫院内职工的罪行。他宣读了该院全体职工一致通过的请求政府接管仁爱堂医院的请求书，并控诉沙淑明的罪行说：沙淑明在修道院内藏着收发报机、军用电话机、美国海军腰刀以及香港出版的反动书籍多种（以上物件经该院职工检举后，已由重庆市公安局加以没收）。她常假借下乡医病为名，到处散布谣言。在院内，她经常打骂工人，甚至有时强迫工人一天作二十三小时的工，不准女工生孩子。她还无故开除三个工人，其中有一个在该院做工已达三十年。解放以后，沙淑明禁止工人参加工会活动。
    在这个控诉大会上，天主教徒女护士唐正娱、基督教卫理公会重庆教区区长陆光廷及安息日会修徒赵明学等相继控诉了教会内帝国主义分子的各种罪行。
    最后，与会代表一致通过决议，向人民政府提出要求：严惩帝国主义分子宋伯华、沙淑明等，成立包括各界人士参加的调查育婴堂帝国主义分子残害中国婴儿的罪行的委员会，接管育婴院和仁爱堂医院。
    现重庆市人民政府已接受与会代表的意见，成立了调查委员会，积极进行调查和处理。
