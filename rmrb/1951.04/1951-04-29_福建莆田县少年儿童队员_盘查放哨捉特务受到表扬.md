Fujian Putian County Young Pioneers
Commended for Patrolling, Keeping Watch, and Capturing a Spy

To the Editor:
The action of Wei Guangyuan, captain of the Young Pioneers of Fengshan Street, Chengxiang, Putian County, Fujian Province, in leading his team to capture a spy is a patriotic act worthy of praise. More than one hundred Young Pioneers of Fengshan Street, having received an education in patriotism, have always taken their duties of guarding, keeping watch, and checking passes very seriously.

On February 27th, it was the turn of the Young Pioneers team led by captain Wei Guangyuan and male members Zheng Kuangzhong, and female members Li Yuzhen, Zheng Yugu, Chen Meiyu, Li Qiong, Huang Yunluan, Huang Jinzhu, etc., to stand guard outside the East Gate. At around 10 o'clock, they saw a person carrying baskets and another person hurrying from the south bank of the dike, talking to each other in whispers. Captain Wei Guangyuan found their behavior suspicious and went forward to question them. They discovered that the stamps on the two men's passes were blurred, and the names and ages they gave did not match what was written on the passes. The team members wanted to check the contents of their baskets, but the men nervously dodged. However, the children acted quickly and found a disassembled handgun and five bullets hidden at the bottom of the baskets. The men thought it would be easy to deceive the children and insisted that it was just a piece of iron. Captain Wei Guangyuan immediately blew his whistle, signaling for assembly, and the six members scattered nearby immediately gathered around. Seeing that the situation was not good, the two bad guys turned to run, but they were already surrounded by more than a dozen Young Pioneers, who pushed and shoved them, escorting them to the town government.

The Putian County People's Government and the Fengshan Street Government praised and rewarded the Young Pioneers for this patriotic act. Putian Provincial High School awarded the team a prize banner at the anti-American aggression and aid-Korea movement rally. The local student union also called on students to learn from the Young Pioneers of Fengshan Street.

### 福建莆田县少年儿童队员  盘查放哨捉特务受到表扬

    福建莆田县少年儿童队员
    盘查放哨捉特务受到表扬编辑同志：
    福建省莆田县城厢凤山街少年儿童队队长魏光元领导队员捉特务，是一件值得表扬的爱国行为。凤山街的一百多个少年儿童队员，因为接受了爱国主义的教育，对站岗放哨、检查路条的事，向来很认真。
    二月二十七日，轮到儿童队队长魏光元和男队员郑匡忠、女队员李玉珍、郑玉姑、陈梅玉、李琼、黄云鸾、黄金珠等，在东门外放哨。十点钟左右，他们看见一个挑着筐篓的人和另外一个从堤南边匆忙走过来的人在一起交头接耳地谈话。队长魏光元看见他们形迹可疑，就上前盘查。发现那两人的路条（通行证）上的印章模糊，所说名字和年龄和路条上所写的也不符合。队员们要检查他篓里的东西，那人慌张地躲闪。但儿童们动作很快，上去就翻出藏在篓底的一把拆散的手枪和五粒子弹。那人还以为小孩子好欺骗，硬说这是铁块。队长魏光元马上吹起哨子，发出集合的信号，散在附近的六个队员立刻围拢来。这两个坏家伙看情势不对，转身想跑；但已被十几个儿童队员包围起来，前推后拥地把他们押送到镇公所。
    对少年儿童队这样的爱国行为，莆田县人民政府和凤山街街政府都给予表扬和奖励。福建省立莆田中学在抗美援朝运动的大会上，授予该队奖旗一面。当地学生联合会也号召同学们向凤山街少年儿童队学习。
