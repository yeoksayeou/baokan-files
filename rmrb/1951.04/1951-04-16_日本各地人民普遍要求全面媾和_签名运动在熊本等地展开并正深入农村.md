　　Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Workers, farmers, students, and people from other classes in various parts of Japan are universally launching movements against rearmament and demanding overall peace. According to a United Press report: The overall peace movement has expanded to the entire Kyushu Island region. When the Takamatsu Coal Mine Workers' Union was conducting a struggle to demand higher wages, it simultaneously collected signatures demanding overall peace and quickly received the response of 4,000 people. The Kumamoto City Printing and Publishing Workers' Union printed 80,000 signature tickets and sent them to the preparatory committee for the overall peace movement in the city. In Omuta City, where factories of the Mitsui monopoly group are lined up, under the leadership of the preparatory committee of the overall peace patriotic movement association, which had already been established, a signature movement demanding overall peace is being launched. The Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union alone has collected the signatures of 350 people. Akizuki Town, Asakura County, Fukuoka Prefecture, also organized an overall peace promotion committee, with participants including workers, the town mayor, town councilors, and national capitalists.
　　The Japan Democratic Youth Fatherland Front, the Hokkaido Student Autonomy Association League, and others decided to hold a Hokkaido-wide symposium on the peace issue in Sapporo on March 11th, but it was forcibly dissolved by armed police and special agents just before the meeting was about to begin. More than 70 representatives from Daiyubari, Heiwa, Horonai, and other places were extremely indignant about this incident, and they resolved to organize youth and women's peace conferences and vigorously launch the overall peace movement.
　　The Japanese people's movement demanding overall peace is also penetrating into the countryside. The village council of Kasagi Village, Ena County, Gifu Prefecture, unanimously passed a proposal on March 7th, put forward by Communist Party member of the village council, Iida, regarding the demand for overall peace and opposition to rearmament. The next day, a joint meeting of village councilors from Kasagi, Nakanokata, Hirukawa, and Iiji villages was held, and about 70% of the participants approved the resolution of the Kasagi Village Council. The Farmers' Association of Kaminoyama Town, Yamagata Prefecture, also held a meeting of 200 people on March 15th, resolving to demand overall peace and oppose rearmament. In the Maki settlement (note: a settlement is a small village) in Tosu Town, Saga Prefecture, and the Kawaharayu settlement in Agatsuma County, Gunma Prefecture, more than 200 people have already signed their names demanding overall peace.
