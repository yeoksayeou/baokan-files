From Mott's Life Journey, See How the United States Uses Religion for Aggression
    Xu Ying
    American imperialism uses religion as a tool to invade the world. We can find ample evidence of this from the life journey of the American Christian and "citizen of the world," Mott.
    What kind of person was Mott? Why did American imperialists value him so much?
    Mott called himself a "living Christ," saying, "God is at my side." He said, "Jesus is the hope of the world," and he wanted to "promote the Kingdom of God." In reality, he did not serve religion, but rather, following the aggressive steps of American imperialism, he deployed missionaries around the world in preparation for aggression. If the British missionary Robert Morrison served British imperialism in the early 19th century with the button of a vice-consul, then Mott was an out-and-out running dog of American imperialism. This running dog "sent the power of the North American Association (the central hub for American imperialism's control of global church manpower and finances) to other parts of the world," and American imperialism's control extended into various countries along with it.
    Mott became the secretary of the North American University YMCA on September 1, 1888, engaging in youth work and praying for various universities. He claimed not to be an official and not to be involved in politics. However, he had two classmates and friends who occupied important positions in American politics: one was Miller, who had served as the American Minister to Korea and the Director of Far Eastern Intelligence for the U.S. State Department; the other was President Wilson, who strongly wanted him to be the ambassador to China and was also an important person in charge of the Christian North American Association.
    This Mott, filled with the blood of American imperialist aggression, had the dream of conquering the globe while serving as the YMCA secretary. He said, "A secretary is like a general who must go to the battlefield and work with his soldiers, sharing dangers together," and pointed out that in order to make Christianity a "spiritual tool for conquering the world," one must first demand "unity within itself." He was the creator of turning the religious "personal gospel" into an organized "social gospel," and he changed the content of the YMCA. He was also one of the founders of American imperialism's aggressive cosmopolitanism, advocating for interdenominational and interracial movements at all times and places. Interdenominationalism was centered on American Christianity, uniting various denominations within Christianity (whether Protestant denominations, Catholic denominations, or Orthodox denominations), and also centered on American imperialism to connect with various religions other than Christianity, such as Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, etc.; interracialism aimed to make Chinese, Japanese, Indians, Africans, Scandinavians, and Russians, regardless of race, become one with American imperialism. The purpose of the "interdenominational" movement was to conquer any church and believer in all countries, allowing them to be subordinate to American Christianity; the "interracial" movement was even more vicious, attempting to negate national movements, even negate the meaning of nationality, and attempting to eliminate the national consciousness of the people of various countries through the guise of religion, in order to achieve the goal of American imperialism enslaving the people of the world. These two movements are essentially the same as the "cosmopolitanism" now advocated by American imperialists. Mott harbored this vicious idea, attempting to carry out his so-called work of conquering the world.
    His first target was to attack young students. He formed the first global "World Student Christian Federation." His second goal was to engage in the unification of churches and missions in colonies around the world, and thus he embarked on a journey of 1.7 million miles, or the equivalent of circling the Earth 68 times. The focus was first on China and Japan, and then on the African continent.
    Let's look at a sketch of this "general's" office and how he carried out aggressive activities. "On his desk in his New York office was a piece of glass, under which was a world map. He probably replaced it with the latest revised world map every five years to avoid being outdated. He was once responsible for the economic responsibility of two large world missionary maps (regarding Christianity). He also obtained several maps that talked about Catholic missionary areas. He developed a deep admiration for the Catholic Church's world policy, so his work for decades was to seek a world, cooperative, unified policy among the divided Christian forces. His travels were tools to carry out that cause." "It is often said that he is a politician, but in many ways, he is more like a great general. He observes the situation in the world, investigates the enemy's strengths and weaknesses, patiently unites the forces on all sides, and then concentrates on one point, launching a general attack on the enemy's lines at the appropriate time. His speeches, his organization, his ideas for finding talent, and his methods for training leaders all have this situation. Although he wants to carefully consider the strategies in various small matters, he often wants to summarize them into larger ideas within the entire scope," and this idea is the idea of American imperialism's aggression and annexation of the world.
    Mott's hard work in global activities came at a price. In this world, he traveled 1.7 million miles, or the equivalent of circling the Earth 68 times. The achievements he obtained were also the extraordinary victories of American imperialism. He organized three joint organizations of world Christianity controlled by American imperialism: one was the World Student Christian Federation mentioned earlier; one was the World Missionary Conference established in Edinburgh in 1910, which had a hegemonic nature with British imperialism; and one was the World Council of Churches convened in The Hague, Netherlands, in 1948, which made American imperialism beam with joy. In the World Missionary Conference, which aimed to organize missions around the world, he was appointed as the chairman of the "Evangelization Group for All Non-Christian Areas of the World" and also the chairman of the "Continuation Committee," which used American Christian money and manpower to do organizational work. Before and after the First World War, he formed the World Alliance of YMCAs and the national councils of churches, which were chess pieces that Mott had to place for the American aggression policy. Therefore, after the Second World War, he convened the World Council of Churches with the determination to win, aiming to organize worldwide church groups, and attempted to unite with the Catholic Church, which had a "world policy" and had been "admired" by him for a long time, to realize a dream of a "kingdom" (American imperialism).
    In all of Mott's work, in addition to regularly crossing the Atlantic to Europe, his main global travels were in the East, totaling nine times. Among them, he was most "concerned" about China. He once said, "There is only one country with four hundred million people in the world," and "the lives of all mankind in the world must be ruled by the Kingdom of God," then Mott, who bore the mission of aggression, could not but actively "save the souls of the four hundred million people." He wanted to make these Chinese people with a great history, industriousness, and bravery willingly become slaves of the American imperialist colony, and never be able to resist the exploitation of the trinity of merchants, governors, and priests. Mott advanced following the aggressive steps of American imperialism, first firmly stepping on the Philippines, he said: "We should concentrate our strength in Manila,... their position is extremely important to the work in the Far East." One foot was also stepped on Japan, "Mott spent a lot of effort in promoting the relationship between the United States and Japan," and then directed all his strength towards the land of China. In China's work, the arrow was first aimed at students.
    On November 17, 1909, Mott revealed his intention to launch a full-scale attack on Chinese students in a fundraising letter. He believed that "hundreds of thousands of government-sponsored students in China," "five thousand Chinese students in Tokyo," "hundreds of Chinese students in American universities," and "Chinese students gathered in Europe" would "become the leaders of the new China in the future," and he "believed that the most important work at present is to make these people Christianized and have friendly relations with Christianity." He said: "I often have such a desire, because I am afraid that we will lose this excellent opportunity." Mott's intention was obvious: he wanted to train Chinese students to become servants of the United States and tools for invading China.
    As early as after the Boxer Movement, from 1901 to 1902, Mott went to the Pacific "to guide students in the Far East and South Asia to become disciples of Christ." After the establishment of the Edinburgh World Missionary Conference, he went to China from 1912 to 1913. After he preached in eleven cities, he said in his published report that 720 students had been baptized and joined the church, and it was expected that another 1,000 students would join the church by the end of six months.
    As early as 1913, American imperialists played out a scene similar to the story of appointing Stuart as ambassador more than 30 years later. At that time, it was just after the demise of the Qing Dynasty, and the United States wanted to promote this "citizen of the world" – Mott – as the ambassador to China. U.S. President Wilson said in a letter to a friend that he had the same intentions as Mott, saying: "The most important thing in my mind is that many of the activists who are now building a new China in China are members of the YMCA, and many of them have been educated in American universities. The direct or indirect Christian influence in front of them is very significant, and this influence should of course be preserved there... Mr. Mott is a friend I have known for a long time. He has the qualities of a statesman equal to anyone I know. He is not only very familiar with the situation in China, but also deeply trusted by all good people in the Christian world. I want to send him a telegram asking him to stay in China as the U.S. ambassador to China..."
    Mott did not show the fox tail like Stuart did later. He declined to serve as ambassador or similar political or religious affairs positions. But he always instigated all religious activities behind the scenes. For example, when he was in China, "he requested that the next World Student Christian Federation Conference be held in Beijing,... He recognized that it was an important place for China to fight against the anti-Christian movement." The Methodist Church he belonged to had become the largest church in China, and Rockefeller (American oil tycoon) and Carnegie (American steel tycoon) used their blood-stained gold yuan, hundreds of millions of dollars, to provide him for "evangelism." War criminals Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Tzu-wen, and Soong Mei-ling were all members of the Methodist Church he belonged to (later renamed the Methodist Church). When war criminal Chiang Kai-shek joined the Methodist Church, he said, "This conversion to Christianity was influenced by my mother-in-law and wife, and it is a political action." The price of this political action was to receive American aid to slaughter the Chinese people. In 1948, Mott and war monger Dulles jointly planned to establish the World Council of Churches in The Hague. This was an important part of his plan to "unify the Christian Church." Dulles ranted against the Soviet Union and communism at that religious conference. This infamous war monger inherited Mott's will and used the name of Christianity to carry out the conspiracy of enslaving the world. After American imperialism invaded Korea last year, the World Council of Churches made a resolution declaring North Korea as the aggressor; and strictly prohibited the priests of the association from participating in the World Peace Congress. Is the retired Mott so "uninvolved in politics"?
    Mott's old friend Miller praised him: "No one else in the world can take your place and go to the world as the ambassador of Jesus Christ (should be read as the vanguard of American imperialist aggression)." This is Mott's position of carrying out aggression under the guise of religion.
    Good religious people, please take a look at how American imperialists use religion to carry out aggressive activities from Mott's biography. This is the self-portrait of American imperialists using religion.

　　从穆德的一生行踪中看美国如何利用宗教进行侵略
    徐盈
    美帝国主义利用宗教作为侵略全世界的工具，我们从美国基督教徒“世界的公民”穆德的一生行踪中，得到了俯拾即是的证明。
    穆德是个什么样的人？美帝国主义者为何看重他？
    穆德自称为“活基督”，说“上帝就在我的手边”。他说“耶稣是世界的希望”，他要“推广上帝的天国”。实际上，他并非为宗教服务，而是随着美帝国主义的侵略步骤，在世界各地布置下准备侵略的传教士。假如说，十九世纪初，英籍牧师马礼逊是带着副领事的钮扣为英帝国主义服务的，那么，穆德也是不折不扣的美帝国主义的走狗。这只走狗，“把北美协会（美帝国主义控制全世界教会人力财力的中心枢纽）的力量送到其他世界”，美帝国主义的控制力量也就随着伸进了各国。
    穆德在一八八八年九月一日就任了北美大学青年会干事，从事青年工作，为各大学祷告。他自称不作官，不过问政治。他却有两个在美国政治上占重要地位的同学好友：一个叫米勒，曾做过美国驻朝鲜公使及美国国务院远东情报主任；另一个是极力想要他做驻中国大使的威尔逊总统，也是基督教北美协会的重要负责人之一。
    这个充满了美帝国主义侵略血液的穆德，在做青年会干事时便有征服全球之梦想。他说，“干事如同一个将军，必须要上战场和他的兵士一同工作，共冒危险才好”，又指出要使基督教成为“征服世界的精神工具”，必先要求自己“本身的统一”。他是把宗教的“个人福音”变为有组织的“社会福音”的创造者，他改变了青年会的内容。他又是美帝国主义侵略性的世界主义创始者之一，他随时随地提倡联宗与联种的运动。联宗是以美国基督教为中心，团结基督教中的各宗派（不论是抗议宗中间的各宗派或是天主教派，或是东正教派），还要以美帝国主义为中心联络基督教以外的各教派，如回教、佛教、犹太教等等；联种是要做到不论中国人、日本人、印度人、非洲人、斯堪的那维亚人以及俄罗斯人，都不分种族与美帝国主义成为一体。“联宗”运动的目的是要征服一切国家的任何教会与教徒，任其从属于美国基督教；“联种”运动则更加毒辣，企图否定民族运动，甚至否定民族的意义，企图通过宗教的外衣来消灭各国人民的民族意识，以期达到美帝国主义奴役全世界人民的目的。这两种运动，实质上和现在美帝国主义者所鼓吹的“世界主义”正是一个东西。穆德就是怀着这种恶毒的念头，企图来进行其所谓征服全世界的工作。
    他的第一个目标，是向青年学生进攻。他组成了第一个世界性的“世界基督教学生同盟”。他的第二个目标就是从事于全世界的教会与全世界在殖民地的差会的统一，这样他便从事于全程一百七十万英里，或等于环绕地球六十八次的旅程。其重点首先是中国与日本，以后便注意非洲大陆。
    请看这个“将军”的办公室的素描及其怎样进行侵略活动吧。“他在纽约办公室里的写字台上放着一块玻璃板，下面压着一幅世界地图。他大概每五年换一张最新修正的世界地图，以免过时。他曾经担负两幅世界宣教大地图的经济责任（关于基督教方面的）。他另外得到几幅地图是讲到天主教的宣教区域。他对于天主教的世界政策起了一种深切的仰慕心，所以他几十年中的工作是要在分裂的基督教势力中求得一种世界的，合作的，统一的政策。他的旅行就是进行那种事业的工具。”“常常有人说他是一位政治家，其实有许多地方，他是更像一位大将军，他观察全世界的情形，调查敌人的势力与弱点，耐心联合各方面的力量，然后集中一点，在适当的时机向敌人的阵线下总攻击。他的演说，他的组织，他的物色人才的思想，他的训练领袖的方法，都有这样的情形。他虽要详细考虑各种微小事情方面的策略，但是他常常要把它们归纳到整个范围内较大的思想中去”，这个思想就是美帝国主义侵略与吞并全世界的思想。
    穆德辛辛苦苦的环球活动是有代价的，在这个世界中走了一百七十万英里或等于环绕地球六十八次的路程，他得到的成就，也就是美帝国主义的非凡战绩。他组织了三个在美帝国主义手中控制的世界基督教的联合机构：一个是前面已提到的世界基督教学生同盟；一个是与英帝国主义有争霸性的一九一○年在爱丁堡成立的世界宣教大会；一个是美帝国主义眉开眼笑的一九四八年在荷兰京城召开的世界基督教协进会。在以组织全世界差会为目的的世界宣教大会中，他被任为“往世界一切非基督教区布道组”主席，又是以美国基督教出钱出人来做组织工作的“续行委办会”的主席。在第一次世界大战前后，他组成了基督教青年会世界协会及各国的基督教协进会，这是穆德为了美国侵略政策而必下的棋子。因此，在第二次世界大战之后，他才以必胜的心情召开组织全世界教会团体为目的的世界基督教协进会，并企图与有“世界政策”，使其“仰慕”已久的天主教联合为一体，实现一个“天国”（美帝国主义）的美梦。
    在穆德的全部工作中间，除了经常渡过大西洋到欧洲去以外，主要的世界性旅行都在东方，前后计有九次之多，其中他最“关切”的又是中国。他曾说过，“世界四万万人的国家只有一个”，而“全世界的人类生活都要受天国的统治”，那么，负有侵略使命的穆德，便不能不积极地来“救救四万万人的灵魂”。他要使这有伟大历史、勤劳勇敢的中国人民，甘心愿作美帝国主义殖民地的奴隶，永不可能反抗商人、总督、教士三位一体的压榨。穆德是随着美帝国主义的侵略步骤来迈进的，一脚先踏稳菲律宾，他说：“我们应集中我们的力量于马尼剌，……他们的地位，和远东的工作，有极大的关系。”一脚又踏上了日本，“在促进美日两国的关系，穆德颇费了不少的力量”，然后以一切力量指向中国的土地。在中国的工作，又是把箭头先对准学生。
    一九零九年十一月十七日，穆德在他的一封募捐信中透露了他向中国学生全面进攻的意图。他认为“中国几十万的官立学生”、“在东京的五千中国留学生”、“在美国大学的几百中国留学生”、“群集于欧洲的中国留学生”，“将来便成为新中国的领袖”，他“以为使这些人受着基督化而与基督教发生友谊的关系，实是目前最重要的工作。”他说：“我常常有这样的渴望，因为恐怕我们失去这种卓绝的机会。”穆德的企图是显然的，他想把中国学生训练成为美国的奴仆，作为侵略中国的工具。
    穆德早在义和团运动后，一九○一年至一九○二年到过太平洋，“引导远东与南亚的学生做基督的门徒”。及至爱丁堡世界宣教大会成立以后，他在一九一二至一九一三年到了中国。他在十一个城市游行布道以后，在其公布的报告中说，有七百二十个学生已受洗入教，预料六个月的终了还有一千个学生入教。
    早在一九一三年，美帝国主义者就曾扮演过一幕与三十多年后请司徒雷登出任大使的同样的故事。那时正是清朝灭亡之后，美国想捧出这个“世界的公民”——穆德出任中国大使。美国威尔逊总统在其一封致友人信中说出他与穆德同样的意图，他说：“我心中认为最重要的一件事，就是现今在中国建设新中国的活动分子中有许多是青年会的会员，并且也有许多是在美国大学里受过教育的人，在他们面前直接或间接的基督教影响是很显著的，这种影响当然是应当保存在那里的。……穆德先生是我素识的朋友，他所具政治家的品格，也和我所相识的任何人相等的，他非但对于中国的情形很是熟悉，并且也为基督教世界里一切良善人民所深信。我想拍电报给他，请他留在中国，代表美国作驻华大使。……”
    穆德没有像日后的司徒雷登一样地露出了狐狸尾巴，他谢绝了出任大使以及类似的政治或宗教事务的职务。但是他却始终在幕后策动着一切利用宗教的活动。譬如当在中国时，“他曾请求在北京举行下届世界基督教学生同盟大会，……他认清那是中国与反基督教运动斗争的重要地点。”他所属的美以美会，已成为中国最大的教会，洛克菲勒（美国煤油大王）、卡内基（美国钢铁大王）都以其沾满鲜血的金元，成亿地供他作“布道”之用。战犯蒋介石、宋子文、宋美龄都是他所属的美以美会（后改为卫理公会）的会员。当战犯蒋介石入美以美会的时候，曾说，“这次信奉基督教，是受了我岳母与妻子的感化，是一种政治行动。”这政治行动的代价，就是得到美援来屠杀中国人民。一九四八年，穆德和战争贩子杜勒斯共同计划成立荷京的世界基督教协进会，这是他“统一基督教会”计划的重要部分。杜勒斯在那个宗教大会上狂吠反苏反共。这个臭名昭彰的战争贩子，继承着穆德的意志，利用基督教的名义，来进行奴役全世界的阴谋。到去年美帝国主义侵略朝鲜后，世界基督教协进会又作了决议，宣布北朝鲜为侵略者；对于世界和平大会，则又严禁该会的教士参加。退休了的穆德，就是这样的“不问政治”吗？
    穆德的老友米勒赞美他道：“全世界没有别人能够代替你的地位，到全世界去做耶稣基督的大使（应读为美帝国主义的侵略先锋）。”这就是穆德披着宗教外衣进行侵略的地位。
    良善的宗教徒们，请从穆德传中看一看美帝国主义者如何利用宗教来进行侵略活动吧。这就是美帝国主义者利用宗教的自我写照。
