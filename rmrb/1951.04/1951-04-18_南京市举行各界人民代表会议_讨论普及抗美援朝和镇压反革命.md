Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th—The second session of the second Nanjing People's Representatives Conference, held from April 8th to 12th, focused on discussing issues such as deepening and expanding the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, and improving urban-rural material exchange.

At the meeting, Mayor Ke Qingshi reported on the various tasks of the past five months and future administrative guidelines. Representatives believed that Nanjing was once the center of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and a nest of counter-revolutionaries. The issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries was particularly important. Whether it was deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement or developing urban-rural material exchange, it was necessary to first suppress the destructive activities of counter-revolutionary elements. Representatives from all walks of life at the meeting accused the counter-revolutionary elements of continuing to do evil after liberation. Worker representative Liu Guxin said: "If counter-revolutionary elements are not eliminated, the people's production and life will not be guaranteed. Because if you want to produce, they will sabotage. In a certain factory, a special agent and bandit planted a package of explosives and destroyed the boiler, killing and injuring more than a dozen people." During the meeting, the representatives participated in the city-wide mobilization meeting to implement the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries." From the bloody accusations of many victims or their families who suffered from the counter-revolutionary elements, they further realized the monstrous crimes of the counter-revolutionary elements, and also saw the urgent demand of the broad masses of people to suppress the counter-revolutionaries. In just five hours, the conference received more than 7,000 letters requesting the government to resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, the representatives saw that the government's acceptance of the masses' demands gained the enthusiastic support and endorsement of the people. Many representatives said: "In the past, the understanding of suppressing counter-revolutionaries was not deep enough. Now we truly realize the truth that being kind to counter-revolutionary elements is being cruel to the people." The representatives criticized the government's past "unlimited leniency" towards counter-revolutionary elements and expressed warm support for the recent measures taken by the government to resolutely suppress a group of counter-revolutionary elements. In his concluding speech, Mayor Ke Qingshi, on behalf of the Municipal People's Government, reviewed the "unlimited leniency" bias that existed in the past in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and stated that the government would definitely accept everyone's opinions in the future, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary elements, and protect the interests of the broad masses of people in Nanjing.

The meeting also focused on the issue of popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. The representatives unanimously believed that since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in Nanjing, 80% of the city's population has received patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea. The awareness of people from all walks of life has been unprecedentedly improved, the ideas of being pro-American and worshiping the United States have been eliminated, and the national self-esteem and self-confidence have been greatly enhanced. However, the movement is not popular and deep enough. The meeting decided to continue to deepen and expand this movement in the future. The specific steps are: in April, through responding to the decision of the World Peace Council, launching the signing of the World Peace Council's declaration on concluding a peace treaty, holding voting on the Japanese issue, and preparing for the "May 1st" demonstration parade; after "May 1st," the activists in the movement will be absorbed into study organizations such as reading newspapers, listening to broadcasts, cultural centers, and night schools, and through them, a systematic and regular learning system will be tried out among organized and unorganized residents. In order to deepen this movement, it was decided to invite cultural and educational institutions to hold current affairs propaganda lectures from April to deeply carry out patriotic education, and to hold four to five large-scale exhibitions. The main part of the above work will be completed in August. At the next People's Representatives Conference, a review and summary of the Resist America, Aid Korea work will be conducted, and a major inspection of the implementation of the patriotic covenant will be held.

Regarding the issue of urban-rural material exchange, the meeting believed that it is necessary to rectify the trade associations of various industries, abolish feudal monopolies and various bad rules, and facilitate the entry of agricultural products into the city; at the same time, vigorously organize industrial products to go to the countryside.

Finally, after careful discussion by all the representatives, the meeting formulated the patriotic covenant of the city's people.

　　南京市举行各界人民代表会议
　  讨论普及抗美援朝和镇压反革命
    【新华社南京十六日电】四月八日到十二日举行的南京市第二届第二次各界人民代表会议；着重讨论了深入和扩大抗美援朝运动、镇压反革命活动和做好城乡物资交流工作等问题。
    会上，柯庆施市长报告了过去五个月的各项工作和今后施政方针。代表们认为：南京曾经是国民党反动统治的中心，是反革命的巢穴，镇压反革命问题特别重要，无论是深入抗美援朝运动或开展城乡物资交流，都必须首先镇压反革命分子的破坏活动。各界代表在会上控诉了解放后反革命分子仍在继续作恶的许多罪行。工人代表刘古心说：反革命分子不肃清，人民的生产和生活都没有保障。因为你要生产，他就要破坏。某厂因为一个特务匪徒放了一包炸药就炸毁了锅炉，炸死、炸伤了十几个人。在会议期间，代表们曾参加了全市贯彻执行中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例动员大会，从许多遭受反革命分子残害的受难者或其家属的血泪控诉中，进一步认识了反革命分子的滔天罪行；也看到了广大人民要求镇压反革命的迫切。在短短五个钟头里面，大会即接到了七千多封要求政府坚决镇压反革命的信件。同时，代表们看到了政府接受群众要求之后获得人民热烈的支持和拥护。许多代表说：过去对镇压反革命的认识还不深刻，现在才真正认识到对反革命分子仁慈就是对人民残忍的真理。代表们对于政府过去对反革命分子的“宽大无边”的偏向提出了批评，对于最近政府坚决镇压一批反革命分子的措施表示热烈拥护。柯庆施市长在总结发言中代表市人民政府对于过去在镇压反革命工作上存在的“宽大无边”偏向进行了检讨，表示政府今后一定接受大家的意见，坚决镇压反革命分子，以保障南京市广大人民的利益。
    会议并着重讨论了普及和深入开展抗美援朝运动问题。代表们一致认为：南京市自展开抗美援朝运动以来，全市已有百分之八十的人受到了抗美援朝爱国主义的教育，各阶层人民的觉悟都空前提高，扫除了亲美、崇美的思想，民族自尊心和自信心大大增强。但运动还不够普及和深入。会议决定今后要继续深入和扩大这一运动，具体的步骤是：在四月份内，通过响应世界和平理事会决定，发动拥护世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约宣言的签名，举行对日本问题的投票和准备“五一”示威游行；“五一”以后，把运动中的积极分子吸收到读报、广播收听组、文化馆和夜校等学习组织中去，并通过他们在有组织与无组织的居民中试行建立系统的经常的学习制度。为了深入这一运动，决定自四月份起，邀集各文化教育机关举办时事宣传讲座，深入进行爱国主义教育；举办四次到五次大规模的展览会。以上工作的主要部分都争取在八月完成。到下次各界人民代表会议时，进行一次抗美援朝工作检查和总结，并举行一次实行爱国公约的大检查。
    关于城乡物资交流问题，会议认为要整顿各行业的同业公会，废除封建把持和各项陋规，便利农产品入城；同时，应大力组织工业品下乡。
    会议最后经全体代表慎重讨论，订出了全市人民的爱国公约。
