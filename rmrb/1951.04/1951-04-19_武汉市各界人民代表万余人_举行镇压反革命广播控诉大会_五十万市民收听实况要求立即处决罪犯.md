Xinhua News Agency Report: Wuhan City

　　Wuhan City, April 15th—According to Xinhua News Agency, over ten thousand representatives from all circles of Wuhan held a broadcast rally at Zhongshan Park Square to accuse and denounce counter-revolutionaries. Half a million citizens throughout the city listened to the live broadcast of the rally.

　　After the rally began, Zhu Dixiu, Director of the Wuhan Public Security Bureau, delivered a report on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Following this, people from all walks of life voiced their angry accusations against the arrested secret agents. The Wuhan Municipal People's Government immediately accepted the demands of the representatives and ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to escort eight heinous counter-revolutionaries to the venue, including Hao Zhao, Niu Junbin, Yang Hanyi, Hu Huixue, Wang Yukun—the perpetrators of the "June 1st" Massacre—and the secret agent bullies Li Yutian, Xiang Bingnan, and Zhou Sanmao. Over ten thousand people in the audience shouted in unison, "Kneel down!" The eight counter-revolutionaries immediately knelt before the people, lowered their heads, and trembled with fear. The emotions of the more than ten thousand people in attendance became increasingly agitated and resentful as the accusations progressed. Xu Zhiqing, a representative of the maritime workers, accused the major wharf secret agent and bully Li Yutian of his crimes. The bandit Li Yutian had served as a standing committee member of the Kuomintang Special Party Headquarters and held more than twenty other false positions. He consistently exploited and oppressed workers, forced maritime workers to join the Kuomintang, organized the "Ten-Man Group" spy organization to monitor workers' activities, and organized dozens of thugs to frequently beat and scold fellow workers. Xu Zhiqing pointed at the bandit Li with grief and indignation, saying, "Li Yutian! You not only sucked the blood of the living, but you even refused to spare the dead!" At this point, the crowd below the stage became impassioned, shouting, "Shoot Li Yutian!" Ma Zhongyang, the former manager of the Joint Bookstore, pointed his finger, grinding his teeth, at the secret agent Niu Junbin, who had arrested him and was now kneeling on the stage, saying, "Young Niu! Let me tell you, when you arrested the six of us, only one of us was a Communist Party member, but now all six of us are glorious Communist Party members!" The crowd cheered in unison, "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

　　Xie Jianheng, a teaching assistant at Wuhan University, recounted the events of the "June 1st" Massacre to the assembly. On May 30, 1947, faculty and students of Wuhan University held a peaceful forum, calling on the Kuomintang authorities to cease their attacks on the liberated areas. At approximately 3:00 AM on June 1st, more than 2,000 secret agents, military police, and regular police of the reactionary American Chiang Kai-shek clique surrounded Wuhan University and conducted a massive search and arrest operation. Students rushed out of their dormitories to rescue the arrested faculty and students, but the reactionaries opened fire, killing three students on the spot and wounding more than twenty others. Xie Jianheng angrily accused: These heinous secret agents even drew up a blacklist on the eve of liberation, plotting to arrest more than five hundred faculty and students and execute them on the spot. He said: "Compatriots! Think about it! If we hadn't been liberated, what would become of Wuhan University today!" He demanded that these murderers with bloodstained hands be escorted to the graves of the martyrs on Luojia Mountain and executed. The roar of "Blood for blood! Avenge the dead martyrs!" immediately echoed from below the stage.

　　At the venue, letters of opinion from the representatives were submitted to the rostrum like snowflakes. From 12:00 noon to 6:00 PM, the nine telephone lines installed at the venue connected with the audience outside the venue more than four thousand times. Some units even sent the public's opinion letters to the venue. The vast masses inside and outside the venue put forward a common demand: "Shoot these secret agents!"

　　Wu De峰, the Mayor of Wuhan, summarized the opinions of all the representatives on behalf of the People's Government and said: "The People's Government accepts the demands of the broad masses and has decided to take these heinous secret agents to the areas where they committed their atrocities to be executed, so that the compatriots who have been persecuted by them can witness these counter-revolutionaries facing justice before the people!" At this moment, cheers and applause shook the venue like spring thunder.

　　Half a million people in factories, schools, government offices, and streets and alleys throughout the city, who listened to the live broadcast of the rally, expressed boundless indignation at the bloody crimes committed by the secret agents and bandits. The Wuhan Maritime Workers' Union organized fourteen listening stations, with a total of more than three thousand maritime workers and their families listening to the broadcast. When they heard Xu Zhiqing, the representative of the maritime workers, accuse Li Yutian and other secret agent bullies of their crimes, they unanimously angrily said: This time the government has vented our anger. In the future, we must resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries so that we can live in peace. Zheng Yong'an, a railway worker from Jiang'an, said: In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang, the world belonged to secret agents and bandits, but today the world belongs to the people. If these secret agents are not eradicated, our motherland cannot be built well. When the entire faculty and students of Wuhan University heard the accusation of the crimes of the perpetrators of the "June 1st" incident and demanded that they be escorted to the graves of the three martyrs for execution, everyone cheered wildly and immediately lined up to sweep the graves of the three martyrs on Luojia Mountain. In the evening, they held a school-wide conference to discuss and pass the patriotic covenant of all faculty and students. After listening to the broadcast, the soldiers of the Public Security Headquarters unanimously stated that they would be more vigilant and resolutely protect the lives and property of the people. More than 10,000 farmers from the suburbs of the city also rushed to the urban area to listen to the broadcast. After listening to the broadcast and returning, they all formulated conventions to prevent bandits and secret agents, guaranteeing that no secret agent or bandit would escape.

　　武汉市各界人民代表万余人
    举行镇压反革命广播控诉大会
    五十万市民收听实况要求立即处决罪犯
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：武汉市各界人民代表一万余人，于十五日在中山公园广场上举行镇压反革命广播控诉大会。全市收听大会实况广播的有五十万人。
    大会开始后，武汉市公安局局长朱涤新作了关于镇压反革命的报告。接着，各界人民对已被逮捕的特务分子提出了愤怒的控诉。武汉市人民政府当即接受各界代表的要求，由市公安局将制造“六、一”惨案的凶犯郝钊、牛俊彬、杨汉颐、胡挥血、王裕昆和特务恶霸李雨田、项炳南、周三毛等八个罪大恶极的反革命分子押解到会场。全场一万多人齐声高呼：“跪下来！”八个反革命分子即刻跪在人民面前，低下头来，吓得发抖。会场上一万多人的心情，都随着控诉的进行而激动、愤恨起来。海员工人代表许志清，控诉了码头大特务恶霸李雨田的罪行。李匪雨田曾身兼国民党特别党部常务委员等二十多种伪职，一贯剥削和压榨工人；强迫海员工人参加国民党；组织特务团体“十人团”，监视工人行动，并组织几十个打手，经常打骂工友。许志清悲愤地指着李匪说：“李雨田！你不但吸活人血，竟连死人也不肯放过啊！”这时，台下群众情绪激昂，高呼：“枪毙李雨田！”前联营书店经理马仲扬，咬牙切齿地指着曾经逮捕他而现在跪在台下的特务牛俊彬说：“姓牛的小子！我告诉你，你捉我们六个人的时候，其中只有一个是共产党员，现在我们六个人全是光荣的共产党员了！”全场群众齐声欢呼：“中国共产党万岁！”、“毛主席万岁！”
    武汉大学助教谢鉴衡，向大会诉述了“六、一”惨案的经过。一九四七年五月三十日，武汉大学师生举行和平座谈会，呼吁国民党当局停止进攻解放区。六月一日晨三时许，美蒋反动派的特务、宪兵、军警共二千余人，包围了武汉大学，大肆搜捕。同学们冲出宿舍要救回被捕师生，反动派便开枪射击，当场惨杀了三位学生，打伤了二十多人。谢鉴衡愤怒地控诉说：这些罪大恶极的特务分子，在解放前夕还开列了黑名单，阴谋再逮捕五百多个师生就地杀害。他说：“同胞们！想一想吧！如果不是解放了，还有什么现在的武汉大学！”他要求把这些手上沾满了鲜血的凶犯押到珞珈山烈士的墓前枪决。台下立即又响起“以血还血！为死难烈士复仇！”的吼声。
    在会场上，代表们的意见书像雪片似地递上了主席台。自十二时到下午六时，会场上装置的九部电话机，共与会场外的听众通了四千多次电话。有些单位并把群众的意见书送到会场上来。会场内外的广大群众们提出了一个共同要求：“枪毙这些特务分子！”
    武汉市市长吴德峰代表人民政府总结了全体代表的意见后说：“人民政府接受广大群众的要求，决定把这些万恶的特务分子带到遭受过他们残害的地区去枪决，让受过他们迫害的同胞们亲眼看见这些反革命分子在人民面前伏法！”这时，欢呼声、鼓掌声像春雷似的震撼会场。
    全市各工厂、学校、机关、街道里弄收听大会实况广播的五十万人民，对特务匪徒们所制造的血腥罪恶，表示无限愤慨。武汉市海员工会组织了十四个收听站，一共有三千余海员工人和他们的家属收听广播。当听到海员工人代表许志清控诉李匪雨田等特务恶霸分子的罪恶时，他们一致愤怒地说：这回政府给我们出了气了，今后要坚决镇压反革命分子，我们才能安宁生活。江岸铁路工人郑永安说：过去国民党统治下是特务匪徒的天下，今天是人民的天下了。不把这些特务分子肃清，我们的祖国就不能建设好。武汉大学全体师生在听到控诉“六、一”凶犯的罪状，要求押到三烈士墓前处决时，大家欢呼若狂，立即列队到珞珈山上三烈士墓前扫墓。晚上，他们又召开全校大会，讨论和通过全校师生的爱国公约。公安总队战士们，在听了广播后，一致表示，要更加提高警惕，坚决保卫人民的生命财产。该市郊区农民也有一万多人赶到市区来听广播。他们在听完广播回去后，都纷纷订立了防土匪、防特务的公约，保证决不让一个特务匪徒漏网。
