Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

　　To the Editor:
    The People's Daily published a letter in the "Reader's Letters" column on January 31st criticizing the cadres of Xige Village, Tenth District of our Fengrun County, for failing to treat the family of martyr Liang Gui with the preferential treatment stipulated by the government. Our county believes that such criticism is very good, as it can help us change our past dilatory work style.
    Since Liang Gui joined the revolution in September 1945, the government has provided preferential treatment to his family as a revolutionary military family. When Liang Gui died in action, the county government was unaware. After confirmation, the district government issued the certificate of sacrifice to Liang Bao Wan, Liang Gui's family member, in March 1949 in order to retroactively issue the pension. However, he did not submit the form until November 29, 1950, when Liang Bao Ru, the village's finance and grain committee member, brought it to the county People's Government. Liang Bao Ru was unable to explain why the report to the county was delayed for one year and eight months. For the sake of caution, our county asked the person to leave the form for investigation. After the district and village confirmed the facts, it was submitted to the special commissioner's office for review and approval. After approval on January 18 this year, the martyr Liang Gui's sacrifice pension of 800 jin of millet was fully issued on February 20, 1951.
    In addition to informing you of the above situation, we should also review our superficial and irresponsible work style. We must change this undesirable work style in the future.

### 河北丰润县人民政府检讨拖沓作风

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　河北丰润县人民政府检讨拖沓作风编辑同志：
    一月三十一日人民日报《读者来信专页》上，刊登了一封读者的信，这封信批评我县十区溪歌庄干部没有按照政府规定，优待烈士梁贵同志的家属，我县认为这样提出批评是很好的。可以帮助我们改变以往办事拖拉的作风。
    梁贵同志自一九四五年九月参加革命后，政府对其家属即按革命军人家属优待。梁贵同志牺牲时，当时县府不知道。后来得到证实，为补发抚恤金，即于一九四九年三月由区政府将牺牲证明表发给梁贵同志的家属梁宝万。但他一直未交该表，至一九五○年十一月二十九日，才由该村财粮委员梁宝儒送到县人民政府。而梁宝儒对于为啥拖延一年零八个月才报县的情况又交代不清。为慎重起见，我县即让来人将表留下，以便调查，经过区、村了解属实后，即呈专署审核批示，在今年一月十八日批准后，已将梁贵同志牺牲抚恤金小米八百斤于一九五一年二月二十日全部发给。
    除将以上情况告知外，我们亦应检讨工作浮浅和不负责任的工作作风，今后我们一定要改变这种不良作风。
                丰润县人民政府
