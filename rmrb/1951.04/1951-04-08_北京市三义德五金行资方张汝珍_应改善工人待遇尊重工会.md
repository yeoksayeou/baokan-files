    Zhang Ruzhen, Capitalist of Beijing Sanyide Hardware Store,
    Should Improve Worker Treatment and Respect the Trade Union

    Editor:
    Zhang Ruzhen, the capitalist of the Sanyide Hardware Store in the Sixth District of Beijing, attacks trade union cadres and undermines the authority of the trade union. He also violates the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital and developing production by providing workers with excessively low wages. The facts are as follows:
    Wang Weiyin, a worker at the Sanyide Hardware Store, was elected as the organization committee member of the Beijing Hardware Industry Trade Union last year. Zhang Ruzhen was very dissatisfied with this and often found fault to attack him. Once, when Wang Weiyin was distributing trade union membership badges, Zhang Ruzhen spread rumors everywhere, saying, "Wang Weiyin deposited the money paid by members for the badges in the bank and embezzled two months of interest." Zhang Ruzhen also frequently dampened workers' enthusiasm for learning. He told workers, "You didn't have a good father or mother, how can you still study?"
    Last August, the labor and capital sides of the Beijing hardware industry signed a collective contract. It stipulated that the minimum monthly wage for clerks in Grade C stores should not be less than one hundred jin of millet, and the minimum for apprentices should not be less than forty jin of millet. However, Zhang Ruzhen simply does not implement this regulation. Sanyide is actually a Grade B or higher hardware store with a very good business. Last year, the income from the books was about 1 billion yuan, with a net profit of 180 million yuan. However, the clerks' wages are only 60 jin of millet per month, and apprentices only get 15 jin of millet per month.
    The year-end bonus for 1950 was also not distributed according to the regulations of the Government Administration Council. When workers raised objections, Zhang Ruzhen replied, "It's none of your business. Giving you wages is already mutual benefit for labor and capital." In order to improve labor-capital relations, the workers went to the Municipal Labor Bureau to request a solution. After Zhang Ruzhen learned of this, he immediately wanted to dismiss all employees and force them to leave the factory. Although Zhang Ruzhen's attempt was not fully realized due to the protest of all employees, apprentice Meng Xiankai was ultimately dismissed. Zhang Ruzhen's serious illegal behavior is now being investigated and dealt with by relevant authorities.

### 北京市三义德五金行资方张汝珍  应改善工人待遇尊重工会

    北京市三义德五金行资方张汝珍
    应改善工人待遇尊重工会编辑同志：
    北京市第六区三义德五金行资方张汝珍，打击工会干部，破坏工会威信；并违反了劳资两利，发展生产的原则，给予工人过低的待遇。事实是这样：
    三义德五金行工人王维印，去年被选为北京市五金业工会组织委员。张汝珍对此非常不满，经常找岔子打击他。有一次，王维印在发工会会员证章时，张汝珍就到处造谣说：“王维印将会员交的证章钱存到银行里，贪污了两个月利息。”张汝珍还经常打击工人学习情绪。他对工人说：“你们没修个好爸爸、好妈妈，你们还能念书？”
    去年八月，北京市五金业劳资双方订立集体合同。其中规定：丙等铺子店员每月工资最低不能少于一百斤小米，学徒不能少于四十斤小米。但张汝珍根本就不执行这一规定。三义德实际是乙等以上的五金行，营业情况很好，去年流水账的收入约十亿元，纯利赚了一亿八千万元。可是店员的工资每月只六十斤小米，学徒每月只十五斤米。
    一九五○年年终奖金，也没有按照政务院规定办法发放。工人提出意见时，张汝珍回答说：“你们管不着。给你们工资就是劳资两利。”工人们为改进劳资关系，曾到市劳动局请求处理。张汝珍知道这件事后，立即就要解雇全体职工，强迫他们离厂。因为全体职工的抗议，张汝珍的企图虽未全部实现，但学徒孟宪楷终于被解雇。张汝珍这种严重的违法行为，现已由各有关机关调查处理。
