　　Self-criticism for Not Seriously Implementing the Central Committee's Decision to Establish a Propaganda Network
    中共河北新城县委会 (The CCP Xincheng County Committee, Hebei)
    Our county committee held an erroneous attitude towards the Central Committee's decision to establish a propaganda network for the people, which resulted in the decision not being implemented in our county.
    Originally, after the Hebei Provincial Committee's propaganda conference at the end of January, it coincided with the Spring Festival, which was a favorable time to establish a propaganda network. However, our county committee mistakenly believed that we were too busy with work and meetings to proceed. It wasn't until February 13th that County Party Secretary Zhang Xin conveyed this decision and the Hebei Provincial Committee's plan to establish a propaganda network within half a year. Although it was then decided that Li Ke, the head of the County Committee's Propaganda Department, would be responsible for drafting the "County Committee's Plan for Establishing a Propaganda Network," when the plan was brought to the County Committee meeting for discussion and approval, three of the eight County Committee members were absent. Apart from a more cautious study of the timeline and requirements for establishing the propaganda network, the meeting did not conduct a detailed study of the specific methods and steps for realizing this plan. When the County Committee deployed the plan to the districts, it was merely conveyed as is during the county-wide meeting to discuss spring plowing production and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. During the discussion, only a few district committee organization members and propaganda members expressed their opinions in conjunction with the rectification of branch work. None of the district committee secretaries participated in the discussion. When conveying this decision at the Party member training class, some district cadres expressed unwillingness to listen, and the county committee did not criticize or educate them on this erroneous attitude, but rather conveyed it perfunctorily and considered the matter finished.
    Because our county committee failed to implement the spirit of the Central Committee's establishment of a propaganda network, the plan to establish a propaganda network completely failed. The original plan was to have each district complete the key demonstration work of establishing a propaganda network in conjunction with the rectification of branch work in early March. Later, when the central task became the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the county committee did not redeploy the issue of establishing a propaganda network, and the vast majority of district committees did not study it. As a result, except for the fourth district, which established fourteen propagandists in Xinlizhuang, the other districts did not establish any. Some district committees did not even convey the county committee's decision to the district cadres, while others conveyed it very simply. One district committee member from the first district said: "There are so few cadres, and now we have to establish a propaganda network, so being a cadre is also being a propagandist. This can only be done in villages with many activists!" Many county committee members also believed: "There is so much work to do, if we do this, we won't be able to do that," "The more lice, the less itchy; the more debts, the less worry." These people seriously opposed propaganda work and central work. Under the control of this erroneous thinking, when our county committee studied the issue of establishing rapporteurs, it did not base it on the conditions stipulated by the Central Committee, but mistakenly regarded it as a kind of political treatment. Thus, of the twenty-three rapporteurs we decided on, at least ten did not meet the conditions for rapporteurs. A similar situation occurred when establishing propagandists. Out of the sixty branches, one hundred and seven propagandists were established. According to usual understanding, at least five of them have serious compulsory commanding styles. The above situation was not felt to be a serious problem by our county committee until mid-March, when it sent Xu Wenrong, the deputy head of the county committee's propaganda department, and others to cooperate with the first and second district committees to inspect the work of establishing a propaganda network. Now, except for the fifth district, which has established a propaganda network in Beiling, the second and sixth districts still have no news. The original plan to have each district establish a propaganda network in five to eight villages in March has once again failed.
    We examined the reasons for these errors. The main reason is that the county committee did not deeply understand the spirit of the Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network; nor did it seriously study the Hebei Provincial Committee's plan to establish a propaganda network within half a year. At the same time, we still have bureaucratic and commandist work styles. A district committee member in the second district falsely reported that the Mahe village in the district had established propagandists. The county committee's propaganda department did not make a detailed understanding, but blindly reported this achievement to the prefectural committee. In fact, Mahe village has not even established a reading group; the so-called propagandists are just individual cadres who have talked to the masses a few times, and have not actually formed an organization.
    Based on the above situation, we put forward the following improvement suggestions for future work on establishing a propaganda network: (1) We must mobilize all Party members and cadres in the county to conduct a serious study and learning of the Central Committee's decision and related documents. The county committee will also convene a meeting to review past mistakes and formulate a concrete implementation plan. We must convey this spirit to all Party members so that everyone can truly recognize the great significance of establishing a propaganda network from an ideological perspective. Districts that have not completed the establishment of key villages must personally take the lead in establishing demonstration villages, creating experience to promote ordinary villages. (2) In the current movements of resisting America and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, spring plowing and planting cotton, and spring labor to control rivers, we must discover activists and gradually cultivate them into propagandists. (3) In order to prevent the formalistic tendencies of emphasizing quantity over quality and filling the ranks with unqualified personnel in the work of developing propagandists, as well as the purely task-oriented view, we must carefully study and master the Central Committee's and the Provincial Committee's guidelines for establishing a propaganda network. We must conduct a serious review of the propagandists developed in the training class in conjunction with the current propaganda tasks, and formally determine those who meet the conditions as propagandists, and strengthen leadership. For those propagandists who do not temporarily meet the conditions, they should be gradually cultivated into propagandists. In the work of establishing a propaganda network, we must truly achieve establishing one and consolidating one, and make it play a role. However, we must also prevent the closed-doorist tendencies of being overly cautious. (4) Each district should hold short-term training classes in the near future to train propagandists. Each district committee should allocate appropriate cadres to lead this training work. We require the first, second, and third districts to focus on consolidating the propagandists established during the centralized training in April, strengthen organizational leadership over them, enable them to play a role in propaganda, and continue to cultivate and develop new propagandists during the consolidation; the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts should strive to complete the March plan, and establish propaganda networks in five to eight villages in each district, and try to exceed this. In order to realize the above plan, in addition to the various county committee members specifically helping the district committees, the county committee's propaganda department should vigorously grasp this work. (5) Party members and cadres of county and district agencies should re-study the Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network for the people in the entire Party, actively participate in various current tasks, and strive to become a propagandist or rapporteur.

### 对于没有认真执行中央建立宣传网决定的检讨

　　对于没有认真执行中央建立宣传网决定的检讨
    中共河北新城县委会
    我们县委对于中央关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定，抱着一种错误的态度，以致这一决定，未能在我县实现。
    本来在河北省委一月底宣传会议后，恰逢春节，正是建立宣传网的有利时机。但是我们县委却错误地认为工作忙、会议多没有办法进行。直到二月十三日，县委书记张欣同志才传达这一决定及河北省委半年建立宣传网的计划。以后虽然确定由县委宣传部长李克同志负责起草“县委建立宣传网的计划”。但当将计划拿到县委会上讨论通过时，八个县委委员就有三个没有参加。会议除对建立宣传网的时间与要求作了较慎重的研究外，对于实现这个计划的具体方法、步骤，均未作出详细的研究。县委给各区布置时，也只是在全县讨论春耕生产与镇压反革命的会议上，将计划照样作了传达。在讨论时只是几个区委组织委员、宣传委员结合整顿支部工作发表了一次意见，各区区委书记均未参加讨论。在党员集训班上传达这一决定时，一些区干部表示不愿意听，县委对此种错误态度也未进行批评与教育，只是草率地传达一下，就算了事。
    由于我们县委没有将中央建立宣传网的精神贯彻下去，结果建立宣传网的计划完全破产。原来计划在三月上旬，各区结合整顿支部工作，完成建立宣传网的重点示范工作。后来中心工作变为镇压反革命时，关于建立宣传网的问题，县委也没有重新布置，绝大多数区委也没有研究。结果除四区在辛立庄建立了十四个宣传员以外，其他区均未建立。有的区委甚至根本没有将县委的决定在区干部中进行传达，有的区委则传达得很简单。一区一个区委委员说：“干部这样少，又要建立宣传网，当干部又叫当宣传员，这除非积极分子多的村子才能作到！”也有不少县委委员认为：“工作这样多，反正作了这个就作不了那个”，“虱子多了不痒，债多了不愁”，这些人把宣传工作和中心工作严重地对立起来。在这个错误思想支配下，我们县委在研究关于建立报告员的问题时，也就不根据中央规定的条件，而错误地把它看成是一种政治待遇。这样，我们所决定的二十三个报告员，其中至少有十个是不够报告员条件的。在设立宣传员时，也发生了类似情况。在六十个支部里建立了一百零七名宣传员，据平常所了解，其中即有五个有严重的强迫命令作风。以上情况，我们县委直到三月中旬才感觉是一个严重的问题，才派县委副宣传部长许文荣等下去配合一、二区区委检查建立宣传网工作。现在，除五区在北领建立了宣传网外，二、六区仍无音讯。原定在三月份，每区要有五至八个村建立宣传网的计划，又一次流产。
    我们检查发生这些错误的原因，主要是县委没有深刻领会中央关于建立宣传网的决定的精神；对河北省委半年建立宣传网的计划，也没有认真地进行研究。同时我们仍存在着官僚主义和命令主义作风。二区有个区委委员谎报该区马河村已建立了宣传员，县委宣传部并未作详细了解，就盲目地向地委汇报了这一成绩。实际上马河村连个读报组都未建立起来；所谓宣传员也仅仅是个别干部与群众谈过几次话，实际上并未形成组织。
    根据上述情况，我们对今后建立宣传网工作，提出以下改进意见：（一）要发动全县党员干部，对中央决定及有关文件，进行认真地研究与学习。县委并召开会议，检讨已往错误，作出具体执行计划。我们要把这一精神贯彻到全体党员中去，使大家真正从思想上来认识建立宣传网工作的重大意义。未完成建立重点村的区，区委会必须亲自动手搞好示范村，创造经验推动一般村。（二）在当前抗美援朝、镇压反革命、春耕植棉、春工治河等运动中，发现积极分子，逐渐培养成为宣传员。（三）为防止发展宣传员工作中的重量不重质、滥竽充数的形式主义偏向和单纯任务观点，要好好学习与掌握中央及省委建立宣传网的方针。对在训练班中发展的宣传员，要结合当前的宣传任务，进行认真的审查，够条件者正式确定为宣传员，并加强领导。对暂时不够条件的宣传员，应逐步培养成为宣传员。在建立宣传网工作中，真正作到建立一个即巩固一个，并使其发生作用。但也要防止束手束脚的关门主义偏向。（四）各区要在最近举办短期训练班，训练宣传员。各区委要配备适当干部去领导这一训练工作。我们要求一、二、三区在四月份着重巩固集训时建立的宣传员，对他们加强组织领导，使之在宣传中发挥作用，并在巩固中继续培养与发展新的宣传员；四、五、六区争取完成三月份的计划，每区要在五至八个村建立宣传网，并尽量超过。为实现上述计划，除各县委委员具体帮助区委进行外，县委宣传部要大力掌握这一工作。（五）县、区各机关党员干部要重新学习中央关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定，在当前各种工作中积极行动，争取当个宣传员或报告员。
