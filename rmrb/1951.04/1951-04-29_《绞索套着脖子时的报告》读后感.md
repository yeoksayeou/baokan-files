Reflections on "Report Under the Gallows"
　　Jiě Yùzhēn
　　"Report Under the Gallows" is the posthumous work of Julius Fučík, a Czech revolutionary writer and member of the Central Committee of the Czech Communist Party. Its content mainly depicts the heroic deeds of the Czech Communist Party leading the people in the fight against fascism during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. It portrays the historical facts of the sharp struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in prisons, experienced and witnessed by him before and after his imprisonment by the German invaders. It depicts the heroic, steadfast, tenacious, and optimistic heroes, as well as the inhuman special agents and traitors, and expresses the author's own lofty and great thoughts and feelings. Therefore, this report is not only a historical document of "evidence of the times and people" but also educates revolutionaries and the broad masses of the people about what to love, what to hate, what to support, and what to oppose in the struggle for national independence and against aggression.
　　Among the friends I have come into contact with who have read this book, none have not been moved by its thrilling content, and none have not praised the author's literary talent expressed in the work. I think one of the important reasons why this report has gained such a strong attraction and appeal is that it is permeated with the author's full of fighting emotions, clear-cut love and hatred, and the class feelings of an optimistic communist in describing every event and every character throughout the book.
　　For example, the inner description after he suffered countless cruel physical tortures and mental torments:
　　"I love life and fight for it. I love you, people, and I am happy when you answer me with the same love. I am sad when you don't understand me... I was born for joy and I die for joy, and it is unfair to place a sad angel on my grave."
　　This is a voice called out from the bottom of the heart, a voice saturated with fighting thoughts and fighting emotions, which is the concentrated expression of the fighter's personality. It not only expresses the heroic and unyielding spirit of the hero generously going to his death, but also expresses his sincere love for real people.
　　A revolutionary is a true person, and he loves life. He does not want to die, he is attached to the revolutionary life, and he cherishes the life that is beneficial to the revolution.
　　"Death,... to be honest, I hope to meet you again after many years, I hope I can live a free life again, be able to work more, love more, sing more, and wander more in the world. You must know that I am only just a true adult now, and I have so much strength!" This is not a cowardly mentality of fearing death, but a concrete manifestation of the heroic character of a true revolutionary. Such a description does not violate the essential characteristics of a hero and does not damage the hero's lofty qualities. Precisely because he loves life, he can fight more resolutely and bravely. But the life he loves is conditional. He does not love the "life" of living in humiliation.
　　For example, one time the special agent Baum took Fučík from the dark prison to the city of Prague. Sitting in a small restaurant, sitting in the park, observing the crowded stream of people in front of him.
　　"—You are arrested now,—Baum was talking philosophy,—look, has anything changed around you? People still walk, talk, and rush around as before, everything is going on in a certain order, as if you didn't exist. Among these pedestrians are your readers. Have you ever thought that they have added a wrinkle for you?"
　　Another time, after interrogating for many hours, he drove through the beautiful Prague in the evening. The special agent said:
　　"—I know you love Prague. Look at it. Don't you want to come back here? It's so good! If you die, it will still be like this..." The poisonous means of this "life" temptation are more cunning and require a stronger will to resist than the inhuman physical tortures. A true hero can withstand the test of physical torture and can also resist this cunning temptation. How does our hero answer these insidious temptations?
　　"—It would be more beautiful without you." Under the coercion of the hero's noble qualities, the special agent was defeated, and below is a concise description of the special agent's embarrassment.
　　"He sneered, not maliciously, but a little miserably, and said:—You are a madman." The hero is not a madman, but a true person with a clear outlook on life and the world. The reason why the special agent calls our hero a madman only shows their superficial, faithless, and selfish essence. Our hero does not not love life, but loves life the most. However, what he loves is not the life under heavy pressure, not the life that the fascists are trying to suffocate and eliminate, but the free and happy life. Precisely because our hero loves life and his Prague so much, he does not hesitate to sacrifice his personal life to fight. This is the true love of the "madman" that the special agent cannot understand, and it is the hero's will that the bandits cannot destroy by any means.
　　The special agent who holds the power of life and death appears so small and cowardly in the face of the hero's power. As the author himself said: "...what should be done with those puppets with gold medals! One should see all their pathetic pettiness, see all their powerless brutality,..." Let's look at a few more film script-like, very concise descriptions of the torture chamber, and we can better recognize the "powerless brutality." How cowardly the special agent who is screaming while using torture.
　　"—Name? Answer! Address? Answer! Who are you in contact with? Answer! Secret location? Answer! Answer! Answer! We will crush you to pieces!" These descriptions not only express the unyielding spirit of a hero who is highly loyal to the cause of the people and the cowardice of the special agent, but also describe the heroic emotions of the author when writing.
　　The view of life is also expressed in the description of those traitors who exchange the lives of their comrades for their own "life."
　　"The coward loses more than his personal life, and Milek is like this. This deserter from the glorious team is despised even by the enemy.
　　He got a life, this is not life, because the collective vetoed him." This paragraph not only explains the essence of the traitor's "life," but also clearly points out what true life is.
　　The lofty emotions, fighting emotions, and class emotions conveyed by these insightful words are very strong, and almost every word radiates brilliance. And this emotion flows naturally in the work, without any trace of affectation. This is the power of this report to move people, and this is an important condition for forming literary and artistic works that inspire and educate people. Where does this power come from? Without a clear class position, one cannot correctly judge the meaning of life. One cannot truthfully portray heroes, nor can one observe and analyze traitors and special agents with clear distinctions between right and wrong, so as to correctly describe heroes and traitors and special agents, and one cannot generate the lofty class emotions exerted when describing different objects. If the author did not bravely participate in the sharp struggle, did not undergo the severe test of life and death, and the severe test of personal interests and revolutionary interests, if he had not contacted true comrades-in-arms and traitors and special agents in the struggle, recognized the nobility of comrades-in-arms, and experienced the brutality, meanness, and shameless harm of traitors and special agents, he would not have been able to generate such strong feelings of class love and hatred. Without strong class emotions, there is no way to vividly and deeply portray images and write touching plots.
　　What reference significance does such an excellent work have for young literary people or young friends who are willing to engage in literary work in the new China living in different situations? In the new China where the people are in power, young people and writers who live freely and happily, it reminds us once again of Chairman Mao's instruction that we must wholeheartedly and unconditionally participate in the fiery struggle. Go deep into the forefront of the struggle life (representative life, not general life). Only by experiencing and discovering fresh things in the practice of life can we avoid the unrealistic or even unreasonable fabrications in some works when praising heroes and models, and when describing aggressors, counter-revolutionaries, landlords, and other villains, can we not stop at the description of superficial phenomena, but can more essentially reveal them. Only in this way can we strengthen our clear-cut judgment on various things, correctly, vividly and deeply portray images, and be filled with strong love and hatred.

　　《绞索套着脖子时的报告》读后感
　　解驭珍
    《绞索套着脖子时的报告》，是捷克革命作家，捷克共产党中央委员尤利斯·伏契克的遗作。它的内容，主要的是描写捷克共产党在德寇占领捷克时期领导人民向法西斯斗争的英勇事迹的一面，描写他被德寇囚禁前后所经历的和目击的革命与反革命在监狱中尖锐斗争的史实。描写了英勇、刚毅、顽强、乐观的英雄和失掉人性的特务、叛徒等等不同的品质，以及抒发着作者自己的崇高而伟大的思想感情。所以这篇报告不仅是“时代和人的证据”的历史文献，而且是教育革命者，教育广大的人民，在争取祖国独立、反对侵略时应该爱什么、憎恨什么、拥护什么、反对什么。
    我所接触的读过这书的朋友，没有不被它的惊心动魄的内容所感动，没有不赞叹表现在作品中的作者的文学才华的。我想这篇报告所以获得如此强烈的吸引力和感染力的重要原因之一，就是浸透在全书中描写每一件事、每一个人物的作者的饱满的战斗的感情、爱憎分明和乐观主义的共产党人的阶级感情。
    例如叙述他受了无数残酷的肉刑和精神的磨折之后的内心描写：
    “我爱生活，并且为它而战斗。我爱你们，人们，当你们也以同样的爱回答我的时候，我是幸福的。当你们不了解我的时候，我是难过的。……我为欢乐而生，为欢乐而死，在我的坟墓上安放悲哀的安琪儿是不公正的。”
    这是从内心里叫出来的声音，饱和着战斗思想战斗情感的声音，也就是战斗者人格的集中表现。这里面不仅表现了英雄慷慨就义的英勇不屈的精神，同时表现了他挚爱着真正的人。
    革命者自己是真正的人，他爱生活。他不愿意死，他对革命的生活是留恋的，对于有利于革命的生命是珍惜的。
    “死神，……老实说，希望经过许多年之后再同你相会，希望我再过一过自由的生活，再能多多地工作，多多地爱，多多地唱，多多地在世上游逛。要知道我现在才刚刚是一个真正的成年人，我曾有这么多的力量！”这不是怕死的怯弱的心理，而是真正的革命者的英雄性格的具体表现。这样的描写不违反英雄的本质特征，没有损害英雄的崇高品质。正因为他爱生活，所以才能斗争得更坚决更勇敢。但他所爱的生活是有条件的。他不爱苟且偷生的“生活”。
    比如有一次特务标姆从阴暗的监狱里，把伏契克带到布拉格的城里。坐在小饭馆内，坐在公园里，观察着面前拥挤着的人流。
    “——你现在是被捕了，——标姆在谈哲学了，——你瞧，周围有什么变动了吗？人们还像以前一样走路、谈笑、奔波，一切都照一定的次序进行着，就好像没有你这个人一样。在这些行人里边有你的读者。你有没有想到他们为了你曾添过一条绉纹吗？”
    又一次在审问了许多钟头以后，傍晚驰过美丽的布拉格。特务说：
    “——我知道你爱布拉格。你看它吧。你难道不想回到这儿来吗？它是多么好啊！如果你死了它依旧是这样……”对于革命意志的危害性，这种“生”的诱惑的毒辣手段，应该说较诸惨无人道的肉刑更狡猾也更需要坚强意志来对抗。真正的英雄，经得起肉刑的考验，也能抗拒这种狡猾的诱惑。我们的英雄如何回答这些阴险的诱惑呢？
    “——如果没有你们，它会变得更美丽。”在英雄的高贵品质威迫之下，特务是被打败了，下面是简炼地描写着特务的狼狈。
    “他冷笑了一下，不恶毒，倒有点凄惨，说道：——你是一个狂士。”英雄不是狂士，而是具有明澈的人生观和世界观的真正的人。特务所以称我们的英雄是狂士，这只说明他们的浅薄、无信仰、自私自利的本质。我们的英雄，不是不爱生活，而是最爱生活的。但是他所爱的不是生活在重压之下的生活，不是被法西斯竭力想窒息和消灭的生活，而是自由的幸福的生活。我们的英雄正因为非常之爱生活和自己的布拉格，才不惜牺牲个人生命进行战斗。这就是特务不能理解的“狂士”真正的爱，也就是匪徒们用任何方法也不能摧毁的英雄的意志。
    掌握生杀权的特务，在英雄的威力之前，显得多么渺小，多么怯懦。正如作者自己所说：“……对那些带着金章的木偶应当怎样呢！对这些木偶应当看出他们一切可怜的渺小，看出他们一切无力的残暴，……”我们再看看几句电影脚本似的十分洗炼的刑房描写，就更能认识“无力的残暴”。一面用刑一面狂叫的特务多么怯懦呵。
    “——姓名？回答！住址？回答！同谁有联系？回答！秘密地点？回答！回答！回答！我们把你粉身碎骨！”这些描写不仅表现着具有高度忠于人民事业的英雄不屈的精神，和特务的怯懦，也描写着作者写作时的英雄情感。
    对于生活的看法，也表现在对于那些用同志的生命来换取自己“生命”的叛徒的描写上。
    “懦夫损失了比他个人的生命还要多的东西，米列克便是这样的。这个光荣的队伍中的逃兵，连敌人都轻视他。
    他得到一条活命，这不是生命，因为集体否决了他。”这一段描写，不仅说明了叛徒“生命”的实质，同时明确地指出什么是真正的生命。
    这些精辟的语言所传达出来的崇高的感情、战斗的感情、阶级的感情，十分强烈地，几乎是每一个字都放射着光辉。而这种感情在作品中自然地流露着，毫无做作的痕迹。这就是这本报告感人的力量，这是形成启发和教育人民的文艺作品的重要条件。这种力量从什么地方来的呢？如果没有明确的阶级立场，不能正确地判断生活的意义。不能真实地刻画英雄，也不能是非分明地观察和分析叛徒与特务，从而正确地描写英雄以及叛徒与特务，也就不能产生在描写不同对象时所发挥的崇高的阶级感情。如果作者不是英勇地参加尖锐的斗争，没有经受生与死的严重考验，个人利益与革命利益的严重考验，如果没有和真正的战友以及叛徒、特务在斗争中接触，认识到战友的高贵，和体会着叛徒、特务的残暴、卑鄙、无耻的危害，也无从产生如此强烈的阶级的爱与恨的感情。没有强烈的阶级情感，就无从生动地深刻地刻画形象，写出感人的情节。
    这样优秀的作品，对于生活在不同情况的新中国的文学青年或志愿从事文学工作的青年朋友，有什么参考意义呢？在人民当权的新中国，自由幸福地生活着的青年和作家，它使我们再一次想起毛主席指示我们要全心全意无条件地参加到火热的斗争当中去的话。深入到斗争生活的最前哨（有代表意义的生活，不是指一般的生活。）在生活实践当中对新鲜事物有所体验，有所发现，才能避免某些作品中那种歌颂英雄模范时的不生动甚至不近情理的杜撰，在描写侵略者、反革命分子、地主等等反派角色时，才不停止在表面现象的记述，而能更本质的揭露。也才能加强我们对于各种事物产生是非分明的判断，正确、生动而深刻的刻画形象，并且洋溢着强烈的爱和憎。
