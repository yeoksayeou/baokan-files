Guo Peishi Travels Thousands of Miles to Capture a Special Agent

Editor:

Guo Peishi, a woman from Guozhuang, Fifth District, Jun County, Pingyuan Province, traveled back and forth to Zhengzhou twice, covering thousands of miles, to help the government arrest a heinous counter-revolutionary and avenge her murdered son. Her proactive behavior has been commended by the Jun County People's Government in a public notice.

Guo Peishi is a poor peasant. In 1947, when the Eighth Route Army arrived in her hometown of Guozhuang, her son became a militiaman in the village, and she actively participated in revolutionary work. In 1948, Qin Shufang, a local tyrant and landlord from Guozhuang, used a feudal secret society to organize reactionary armed forces, killing dozens of our cadres and civilians. Her son was also killed by Qin Shufang. After liberation, Qin Shufang tried to escape the people's judgment and went into hiding. The class hatred was buried deep in Guo Peishi's heart. She believed that this blood feud would be avenged one day. She inquired everywhere about the whereabouts of her enemy and finally learned that Qin Shufang was hiding in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province. She decided to go to Zhengzhou to find her enemy. Her family's life was quite difficult. She sold some of the remaining grain in her house to pay for travel expenses and brought some sweet potatoes as dry food, and went to Zhengzhou, more than two hundred miles away, alone. She lived in Zhengzhou for more than half a month before she found out the address of Qin Shufang. She covered her face with a towel and personally confirmed the counter-revolutionary criminal Qin Shufang. She originally wanted to report to the Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau immediately, but because she did not have a letter of introduction from the local People's Government, she was afraid that they would not accept it. She returned to Jun County to get a letter of introduction, and then went to Zhengzhou again, where the Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau arrested Qin Shufang.

On March 20th, at the Jun County Fifth District People's Public Trial of Counter-Revolutionary Criminals, County Chief Li Bingyuan praised Guo Peishi's righteous action of actively assisting the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and reissued her 250,000 yuan for travel expenses. Guo Peishi said to the masses: "My child has been dead for three years, and I have always wanted to avenge him. Now I have helped the government catch a special agent, and I have avenged my child." The masses who had suffered from Qin Shufang praised Guo Peishi.

The women of Guozhuang said: "Who says women can't do things? We must learn from Aunt Guo and do a good job in suppressing counter-revolutionaries." On April 4th, the Jun County People's Government issued a notice to the entire county, calling on everyone to learn from Guo Peishi's example, assist the government in arresting counter-revolutionaries, and protect the interests of the people.

### 郭裴氏跋涉千里抓住特务

    郭裴氏跋涉千里抓住特务编辑同志：
    平原省浚县五区郭庄妇女郭裴氏，到郑州来回两次，跋涉千里，帮助政府抓捕罪大恶极的反革命分子，并替她被害的儿子报了仇。她这种积极行为，已经受到浚县人民政府通报表扬。
    郭裴氏是一个贫农。一九四七年，八路军到了她的家乡郭庄，她儿子在村里当了民兵，她也积极参加了革命工作。一九四八年，郭庄恶霸地主秦书芳，利用封建会门组织反动武装，杀害我干部及群众数十人；她儿子也被秦书芳杀死。解放后，秦书芳想逃避人民的审判，藏匿得不知去向。阶级的仇恨埋在郭裴氏心里。她相信这血仇终有一天会报的。她四出探听仇人的下落，终于得知了秦书芳躲藏在河南省郑州市。她就决定到郑州去找寻仇人。她家里生活相当困难，把家里剩余的一些粮卖了当路费，又带了一些红薯当干粮，独自到二百余里外的郑州去。在郑州住了半个多月，她才打听清楚秦书芳的住址。她用手巾遮盖住脸，亲自去看准了反革命罪犯秦书芳。她本想立即到郑州市公安局去报告，但因没有带本县人民政府的介绍信，怕人家不接受。他又回浚县开了介绍信，再到郑州，由郑州市公安局将秦书芳逮捕。
    三月二十日，在浚县五区人民公审反革命罪犯大会上，李炳源县长表扬了郭裴氏积极协助政府镇压反革命分子的正义行动，并补发给她二十五万元路费。郭裴氏向群众说：“我孩子死了三年了，我一直要为孩子报仇。现在我帮助政府抓住特务，也就给孩子报了仇。”受过秦书芳毒害的群众都夸奖郭裴氏。
    郭庄的妇女们说：“谁说妇女不办事？咱们一定得向郭大娘学习，做好镇压反革命工作。”四月四日，浚县人民政府并通报全县，号召大家学习郭裴氏的榜样，协助政府逮捕反革命分子，保卫人民的利益。
