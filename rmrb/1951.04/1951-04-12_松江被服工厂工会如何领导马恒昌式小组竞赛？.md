How does the Songjiang Garment Factory Union lead the Ma Hengchang-style team competition?
　　Under the full support and close cooperation of the Party, the administration, and the Communist Youth League, the Trade Union of the Second Garment Factory in Songjiang Province organized, planned, and purposefully led the workers of the entire factory to launch the Ma Hengchang-style team production competition, ensuring the smooth completion of last year's winter clothing task.

　　The winter clothing made by the factory last year was a new style, with complex sizes, and many workers had never made it before. The task was also very urgent. At that time, rework accounted for 40 percent of the entire factory's output. The trade union seized this key issue and led all the workers in launching the Ma Hengchang-style team production competition. The central theme of this competition was to ensure quality and complete tasks on time or ahead of schedule.

　　Before the team competition started, the trade union committee first held a meeting to discuss how to lead the competition. At the meeting, everyone clarified that labor competition is not like a "gust of wind" that passes with a "burst of energy," but a regular and main method for the trade union to lead the workers in doing a good job in production. The trade union then held two mobilization meetings for the workers, explaining that carrying out labor competition not only increases the workers' contribution to the country, but also benefits the workers themselves. By combining national interests with the personal interests of the workers, the workers' enthusiasm for labor began to rise.

　　When starting to draw up the competition plan, many ideological obstacles were encountered. Some workers said, "What's the point of drawing up a plan? It's enough to guarantee the completion of the task!" Many workers didn't know how to make the plan specific. At this time, the trade union, on the one hand, persuaded and educated the workers, making everyone realize that "competition must have a plan and steps, and cannot be done blindly"; on the other hand, it helped several teams to draw up plans in advance, set a good example, and inspire everyone. Subsequently, each team, focusing on the main problems of the entire factory and workshop, and based on the specific conditions of the team, formulated practical competition plans. For example, the content of the entire factory's competition was to improve quality and save raw materials on the premise of completing the task. The plan of each team should put this general purpose first and combine it with the key issues of the team. For example, the main problem of Xu Wenge's team in the past was arrogance, always feeling that the team's technology was very high. This time, the team stated in the plan: "Our team will never be complacent."

　　Drawing up the team competition plan is only the beginning of the competition. The next step is to closely monitor the implementation of the plan.

　　The Trade Union of the Second Garment Factory adopted the following methods to lead the masses in implementing the plan: Using the "Team Plan Inspection and Statistics Table" to urge the teams to implement the plan. The main content of each team's plan was made into a unified form, and each team filled in the implementation of the plan on time every day, and a total inspection was carried out on the table every half month as a basis for evaluation and awards. In this way, each team paid more attention to its own plan. The Tian Yupiao team posted the plan on the wall and often asked each worker to ensure that everyone remembered it firmly. The teams often checked each other. Some workers also copied a copy of the plan and hung it next to their machines. Every team and every worker in the factory regarded this "Inspection and Statistics Table" as a mirror, and looked at themselves every night when filling out the form to see what achievements had been made and whether there were any problems, using it as the goal for improvement the next day. The team leaders said: "This inspection table can really help us grasp the situation of the team. Whether it is labor discipline, saving, waste, output, quality, as long as you look at the table, you will understand." The trade union committee also formulated "Interim Competition Reward Measures," which were divided into quality, output, saving, waste utilization, labor discipline, unity and mutual assistance, and improving technology and various systems. According to the central content of the competition, the main and secondary were divided, and the scores were set according to the categories as inspection standards. The trade union regularly scored on an individual basis, and finally added up the scores of the entire team to see the good or bad of each team's performance.

　　Timely promotion of advanced experience is also an important method for trade unions to lead production competition. The Tian Yupiao team established a "three-person mutual aid group" in completing the winter clothing task, which ensured improved quality. The trade union's cultural and educational committee immediately introduced this experience on the blackboard newspaper and called on everyone to learn from it. After this working method was promoted throughout the factory, the rework rate of the entire factory decreased from 40 percent to 10 percent to 5 percent. The promotion of experience should also be divided into primary and secondary. Which experience can timely solve the current widespread difficulties, then that should be promoted first. The "three-person mutual aid group" of the Tian Yupiao team can immediately guarantee improved quality, and the trade union promptly promoted this method to the entire factory. In addition, the trade union and the administration jointly formulated the "Interim Competition Reward Measures," making the reward system an important condition for consolidating and improving the team competition. The trade union committee of the factory adopted the above-mentioned main methods to maintain the enthusiasm of the masses for a long time, ensure the successful implementation of the team competition plan, improve product quality, and complete the production task ahead of schedule.

### 松江被服工厂工会如何领导马恒昌式小组竞赛？

　　松江被服工厂工会如何领导马恒昌式小组竞赛？
    松江省被服二厂工会在党、行政、青年团的全力支持与紧密配合之下，有组织、有计划、有目标地领导全厂职工群众，展开马恒昌式小组竞赛，保证了去年冬服任务的顺利完成。
    去年该厂所作冬服是新式样，尺码复杂，很多工友没做过。任务催的又很紧。当时全厂反工活占百分之四十。工会抓住这一关键，领导全厂职工展开了马恒昌式小组生产竞赛。这次竞赛以保证质量，按期或提前完成任务为中心内容。
    在小组竞赛还未开展以前，工会委员会首先开会讨论如何领导竞赛。会上，大家明确了劳动竞赛不是像“刮一阵风”似的“一股劲”就过去了，而是工会领导职工群众搞好生产的经常的主要方法。工会接着又召开了两次职工动员大会，在会上说明：开展劳动竞赛不但增加工人对国家的贡献，对工友本身也有好处。这样把国家利益和职工个人利益结合起来，职工劳动热情开始高涨。
    开始订竞赛计划时，碰到好多思想障碍。有些工友说：“订计划干啥？保证完成任务就行了！”很多工友不知道怎样才能把计划订得具体。这时工会一方面说服教育职工，使大家认识到“竞赛要有计划，有步骤，不能瞎干”；一方面帮助几个小组提前订出计划，作好样子，启发带动大家。接着，各个小组都围绕着全厂和车间的主要问题，并根据本组情况，订出切合实际的竞赛计划，如全厂的竞赛内容是在完成任务的前提下提高质量，节省原材料。每个小组的计划就应把这个总目的放在第一位，并与本组关键问题相结合。如徐文阁小组过去的主要毛病是骄傲，总觉得本组技术很高，这次该组在计划中就订着：“我们小组，决不自满自足”。
    订好小组竞赛计划，还只是竞赛的开始。下一步的工作是抓紧检查贯彻实现。
    被服二厂工会采取了以下办法，领导群众执行计划：运用“小组计划检查统计表”督促小组执行计划。将各小组计划的主要内容制成统一表格，由各个小组每日按时填写执行计划的情况，半个月按表总检查一次，作为评奖材料。这样，各小组对自己的计划就更加重视了。田玉璞小组把计划贴在墙上，经常询问每个工友，使大家牢牢记住。各组之间经常互相检查。有的工友还把计划抄一份挂在自己的机器旁边。全厂每个小组、每个工人，都把这个《检查统计表》当作一面镜子，每天晚上填表时照照自己，看看有何成绩，有无毛病，把它作为第二天的改进目标。组长们说：“这个检查表真能帮助咱们掌握小组情况，无论劳动纪律、节约、浪费、产量、质量、只要一看表，就明白了。”工会委员会又拟订了“计划检查标准”，内分质量、产量、节约、利用废物、劳动纪律、团结互助、提高技术及各种制度等方面。根据竞赛的中心内容，分出主次，按类订出分数，作为检查标准。工会定期以个人为单位评分，最后把全组分数加在一起，就可看出各组成绩的好坏。
    及时推广先进经验，也是工会领导生产竞赛的一个重要方法。田玉璞小组在完成冬服任务中，建立“三人互助组”，保证提高了质量。工会文教委员马上在黑板报上介绍这一经验，并号召大家学习。这一工作方法推广到全厂后，全厂反工活从百分之四十减少到百分之十至百分之五。推广经验也要分主要和次要。那个经验能及时解决当前普遍存在的困难，就首先推广那个。田玉璞小组的“三人互助组”，能马上保证提高质量，工会便及时地把这个方法推广到全厂。此外，工会和行政并共同制订了“暂行竞赛奖励办法”，使奖励制度成为巩固与提高小组竞赛的重要条件。该厂工会委员会，采用了上述几种主要办法，使群众积极性长久保持下去，保证了小组竞赛计划的圆满实现，提高了产品质量，并提前完成了生产任务。
