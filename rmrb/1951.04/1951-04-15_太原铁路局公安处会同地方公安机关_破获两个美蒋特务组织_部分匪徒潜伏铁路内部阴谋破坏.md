Xinhua News Agency: The Public Security Department of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, in conjunction with the Public Security Department of Shanxi Province and the Public Security Bureau of Shijiazhuang City, after a long period of investigation, recently simultaneously cracked the cases of the US-Chiang Kai-shek espionage infiltration organizations "Jin-De Railway Joint Takeover Committee" and "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Jin-Ji Guerrilla Force" in Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, and Yangquan. Sixty-two key espionage elements, including Li Shuxiang, Zhao Guorui, and Yang Wu, were arrested, twenty-four of whom were espionage elements infiltrated into the railway system. One set of radio communication codebooks, a quantity of explosives, various reactionary propaganda materials, and one radio were seized.

The bandit "Jin-De Railway Joint Takeover Committee" was composed of Kuomintang military intelligence (Military Statistics Bureau) and Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (BIS, also known as Zhongtong) agents hidden within the railway system as its backbone, colluding with local bandits and spies in an attempt to carry out sabotage activities, vainly attempting to cooperate with the US-Chiang Kai-shek "counterattack on the mainland" and "take over" the Jin-De Railway (i.e., Taiyuan to Dezhou). It was a joint espionage organization of Chiang bandit's lurking "Party Department, Administration, and Trade Union." They plotted to infiltrate our railway system and the Communist Party and Communist Youth League, extend into "key positions," secretly steal state secrets, investigate the addresses of our responsible cadres in order to carry out assassinations, attempt to sabotage our railway factories, destroy bridges, seize militia weapons, and seize opportunities to riot. They also drafted a "road destruction plan" and so-called "road protection" measures, which were about to be sent to the American consulate in Hong Kong and Chiang bandit's espionage agencies in order to obtain economic and weapons assistance from the US-Chiang Kai-shek, but were quickly cracked by us.

The bandit "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Jin-Ji Guerrilla Force" belonged to the Kuomintang military intelligence system and was combined with the bandit "Jin-De Railway Joint Takeover Committee" to carry out sabotage. In December of last year, the bandits of this espionage organization attempted to use the convenience of railway employees traveling for free to carry radio stations, explosives, firearms, and other items. The principal offender in this case, Pan Jingong, frequently rode in the locomotive driven by driver Chi Bingshou between Shijiazhuang and Yangquan to arrange espionage activities. He once plotted to rob passenger trains in the Niangziguan area, seize postal items, funds, and passenger property as funds for counter-revolutionary activities.

The above two cases involve principal offenders who are extremely heinous and incorrigible counter-revolutionaries. For example, bandit leader Zhao Guorui, a Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics agent, was a running dog raised by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries for a long time. After the Japanese surrender, he successively served as the head of the organization and training section of the Kuomintang Special Party Department and the preparatory committee member of the trade union of the Shimen office of the pseudo-Jin-Ji Railway. In 1946, he joined the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics espionage organization, serving as the "Executive Committee Member of the Jin-Ji Railway Special Party Department and Director of the Shimen Special Party Department Office," "Director of the Yangquan Investigation and Statistics Office," and "Director of the Shimen Investigation and Statistics Office," developing espionage organizations and collecting intelligence on our army. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the people's government arrested Zhao to educate and reform him, and released him in February 1949. However, the criminal did not repent and organized the bandit "Jin-De Railway Joint Takeover Committee" again in 1950, resolutely continuing to be an enemy of the people.

Li Shuxiang, the principal offender of the bandit "Jin-De Railway Joint Takeover Committee," had received Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics espionage training in Nanjing and later joined the military intelligence system. The criminal successively served as the director of the cooperative of the Chiang bandit's Shijiazhuang Railway Trade Union, consistently persecuting workers. After liberation, he was dismissed from his railway status after being reported by workers, and the criminal was arrested and released after government education. After being released, the criminal did not repent, but used running a small business as cover to develop many spies and actively tried to re-establish contact with the military intelligence in Taiwan, being the active organizer and leader of the case. Fellow bandit leader Yang Wu had served as the chief of the Baoji Liaison Station of the military intelligence. After the Japanese surrender, he went to the pseudo-Jin-Ji Railway Bureau and served as the pseudo-"Trade Union Instructor" in Yangquan, the head of the Shijiazhuang Locomotive Depot, and the head of the Yangquan Locomotive Depot. The criminal refused to register after liberation in an attempt to lurk. After joining the bandit "Jin-De Railway Joint Takeover Committee" espionage organization, he actively developed the organization and personally drafted the "road destruction plan" and so-called "road protection" measures. Su Xiaozhong, who had served as a Japanese gendarmerie spy and a Chiang bandit spy, infiltrated our Shijiazhuang Locomotive Depot in September of last year, serving as a helper craftsman. The criminal colluded with bandit leader Li Shuxiang and others in March 1950 to organize a counter-revolutionary organization and actively conspired with bandit leader Li Shuxiang to assassinate Director Hu of our Shijiazhuang Railway Factory and labor model Tian Yunhua. When the American invading forces landed in Incheon, Su gathered six bandit leaders at his home for a secret meeting to celebrate.

Pan Jingong (also known as Pan Laosi), the ringleader of the bandit "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Jin-Ji Guerrilla Force," had worked as a trainee driver in the Yangquan Locomotive Depot. During the Japanese puppet period, he worked as a Japanese spy in Huolu. After the Japanese surrender, he joined the Chiang bandit's "81st Army" and the military intelligence organization. After liberation, the bandit sneaked back to Shijiazhuang and organized this reactionary organization in March of last year, personally developing more than ten bandits and actively engaging in counter-revolutionary activities.

Under the strong guidance of local public security organs, the Public Security Department of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, in conjunction with the public security organs of Shanxi and Shijiazhuang City, has arrested the perpetrators of these two cases after a long and thorough investigation and will prosecute them according to law. According to the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, they will be severely sanctioned.

　　太原铁路局公安处会同地方公安机关
    破获两个美蒋特务组织
    部分匪徒潜伏铁路内部阴谋破坏
    【新华社讯】太原铁路管理局公安处会同山西省公安厅、石家庄市公安局经过长期侦察，于最近在太原、石家庄、阳泉三地同时破获美蒋特务潜伏组织“晋德铁路联合接管委员会”、“反共救国军晋冀游击队”两案，逮捕主要特务分子李书祥、赵国瑞、杨武等六十二名，其中二十四名系潜伏在铁路中的特务分子，缴获电讯密码本一册、炸药一部、反动宣传品多种、收音机一架。
    匪“晋德铁路联合接管委员会”是以暗藏在铁路内部的国民党军统、中统特务为骨干，勾结地方土匪、特务企图进行破坏活动，妄图配合美蒋“反攻大陆”，“接收”晋德路（即太原至德县）的蒋匪潜伏“党部、行政、工会”等联合特务组织。他们阴谋打入我铁路内部和共产党及青年团内部，选择“要害部位”伸展，阴谋窃取国家机密，调查我负责干部的住址以便进行暗害，企图破坏我铁路工厂，炸毁桥梁，夺取民兵武装，伺机暴动，并拟定“破路计划”与所谓“护路”办法，正要送往香港美国领事馆与蒋匪特务机关，以便取得美蒋经济及武器等接济，但迅即被我破获。
    匪“反共救国军晋冀游击队”属国民党军统特务系统，与匪“晋德铁路联合接管委员会”是互相结合进行破坏的。去年十二月间，该特务组织匪徒企图利用铁路职工免票乘车的方便携带电台、炸药、枪支等物。该案主犯潘进公经常坐乘司机池炳寿所驾驶的机车往返石家庄、阳泉间布置特务活动，曾阴谋在娘子关地区抢劫旅客列车，夺取邮政、款项及旅客财物作为反革命活动经费。
    以上两案主犯都是罪大恶极、怙恶不悛的反革命分子。如匪首中统特务赵国瑞，是长期为帝国主义和国民党反动派所豢养的走狗。日寇投降后，又历充国民党特别党部组训组长、伪晋冀铁路石门办事处工会筹备委员等职。一九四六年参加中统特务组织，任匪“晋冀铁路特别党部执行委员兼石门特别党部办事处主任”、“阳泉调统室主任”、“石门调统室主任”等职，发展特务组织，搜集我军情报。石家庄解放后，人民政府曾逮捕赵匪进行教育改造，于一九四九年二月间，将其释放。但该犯不知悔改，于一九五○年又组织匪“晋德铁路联合接管委员会”，坚决继续与人民为敌。
    匪“晋德铁路联合接管委员会”主犯李书祥，曾在南京受过中统特务训练，后又参加了军统特务系统。该犯历充蒋匪石家庄铁路工会合作社主任等职，一贯逼害工人。解放后经工人检举，开除其路籍，并将该犯逮捕后经政府教育释放。被释后，该犯不知悔改，以经营小商为掩护，发展特务多人，并积极设法与台湾军统恢复联系，为该案的积极组织领导者。同案匪首杨武，曾任军统宝鸡联络站长。日寇投降后，到伪晋冀路局任阳泉伪“工会指导员”，石家庄机务段段长、阳泉机务段段长等职。该犯于解放后，拒不登记，企图潜伏。参加匪“晋德铁路联合接管委员会”特务组织后，即积极发展组织，并亲拟“破路计划”与所谓“护路”办法。担任过日寇宪兵队特务和蒋匪特务的苏效忠，于去年九月混入我石家庄机务段，任帮工匠。该犯于一九五○年三月与匪首李书祥等合谋组织反革命组织，并积极与匪首李书祥阴谋刺杀我石家庄铁路工厂胡厂长与劳动模范田蕴华等。美国侵朝军队登陆仁川时苏匪曾聚集匪首六人于其家中秘密开会庆祝。
    匪“反共救国军晋冀游击队”首犯潘进公（即潘老四），曾在阳泉机务段做过学习司机，日伪时期在获鹿当过日寇特务，日寇投降后参加蒋匪“八十一军”及军统特务组织。解放后该匪潜回石家庄，于去年三月组织该反动组织，亲自发展匪徒十余人，积极从事反革命活动。
    太原铁路管理局公安处在当地公安机关的有力指导下，会同山西与石家庄市公安机关，经过长期周密的调查，已将该两案人犯逮捕归案，并将依法提起公诉，根据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例，予以严厉制裁。
