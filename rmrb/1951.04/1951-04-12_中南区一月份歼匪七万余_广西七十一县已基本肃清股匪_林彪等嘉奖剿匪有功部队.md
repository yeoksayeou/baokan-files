The circulars commended all commanders and fighters of the bandit suppression troops in the aforementioned areas for demonstrating a high degree of initiative, correctly implementing the policies and guidelines of bandit suppression and mobilizing the masses, and therefore achieving brilliant victories in completing the bandit suppression tasks. They were encouraged to continue their efforts, display revolutionary heroism, and strive to create even greater achievements in completing all the glorious tasks assigned by higher authorities.
