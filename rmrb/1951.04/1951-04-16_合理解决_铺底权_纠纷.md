Reasonably Resolve "Pudianquan" Disputes

After careful research and absorbing opinions from all sides, the Beijing Municipal People's Government formulated the "Beijing Municipal People's Government Provisional Measures for Handling Pudianquan Disputes" and announced its implementation today. These provisional measures fully implement the policy of protecting housing and developing industry and commerce, and will gradually lead to a reasonable resolution of the long-standing "pudianquan" disputes in Beijing.

The "pudian" in Beijing originated during the Qianlong reign of the Qing Dynasty. Its initial purpose was to protect business operators from being affected by landlords taking back their properties. Later, due to the transfer of "pudianquan," the rights of landlords and "pudianquan" holders became mixed. Landlords' property rights gradually diminished, and most shop premises were controlled by "pudianquan" holders. Furthermore, during the more than ten years of Japanese puppet and Kuomintang reactionary rule, inflation occurred, and rents were rarely adjusted. Landlords' income was minimal, and some landlords had not received rent for many years, which increased property rights disputes. Under these circumstances, neither landlords nor "pudianquan" holders were willing to repair the houses, resulting in many houses gradually deteriorating and collapsing due to disrepair. Clearly, the "pudianquan" system has developed into an extremely unreasonable system today. It hinders the rational use of houses and creates opportunities for speculation and profiteering by a few bad elements who manipulate shop premises.

In order to protect housing and reduce disputes, the Municipal People's Government has explicitly prohibited the creation, sale, lease, pawn, or mortgage of "pudianquan." Existing "pudianquan" disputes should be resolved according to the following principles: First, for shop premises used by "pudianquan" holders for their own business, the landlord shall not take back the property during their continued business operation; second, "pudianquan" holders must reasonably adjust the rent with the landlord. For architectural pudian in which investments have been made, rights should be unified as much as possible. In addition, it is stipulated that "pudianquan" holders have the right of first refusal to purchase the shop premises. For those who have recently acquired the "pudianquan," have little income, or have paid a price to the landlord when creating the "pudianquan," the landlord shall give appropriate compensation to the "pudianquan" holder when they sublet the shop premises to a third party for business use. The right of continued lease and the right of first refusal to purchase are also guaranteed for third parties renting shop premises with "pudianquan." These measures protect both the property rights of landlords and the right to use shop premises by business operators, and fully implement the policy of protecting housing and developing industry and commerce, which greatly benefits landlords and business operators. Therefore, this method will definitely be able to reasonably resolve the existing "pudianquan" disputes. However, since "pudianquan" has a long history and complex circumstances, these provisional measures cannot completely resolve all "pudianquan" disputes. Therefore, supplementary amendments should be made based on specific circumstances during the handling process. It is hoped that both landlords and "pudianquan" holders will reasonably resolve the issues themselves in accordance with the spirit of these provisional measures.

### 合理解决“铺底权”纠纷

　　合理解决“铺底权”纠纷
    北京市人民政府经过慎重研究，吸取了各方面的意见之后，制订了“北京市人民政府关于铺底权纠纷处理试行办法”，并于今日公布实行。这个试行办法，充分地贯彻了保护房屋与发展工商业的政策，将使北京市长期存在着的“铺底权”纠纷逐步地获得合理解决。
    北京市的“铺底”起源于满清乾隆年间，创设的目的是为了保护工商业者不因房东收房而影响营业。其后，由于“铺底”辗转出让，房东与“铺底权”人权利混淆，房东的产权逐渐萎缩，一般铺房多半由“铺底权”人加以支配，加之在过去十多年来日伪与国民党反动统治期间，通货膨胀，房租很少调整，房东的收益微乎其微，且有的房东已多年收不到租，因而增加了不少产权纠纷。在这种情形下，房东与“铺底权”人对房屋都不愿意加以修缮，因而使很多房屋因年久失修而逐渐损坏与倒塌。很显然，“铺底权”的制度发展到今天已经是一个极不合理的制度，它妨碍了房屋的合理使用，也给少数操纵铺房的坏分子造成了投机牟利的机会。
    为了保护房屋，减少纠纷，市人民政府已明令严格禁止“铺底权”的创设、买卖、租赁、典、质等行为，对于现有的“铺底权”纠纷，应根据下述原则加以解决：一、“铺底权”人营业自用的铺房、在其继续营业期内、房东不得收房；二、有铺底权者须向房东合理调整房租。对于对铺房有所投资的建筑铺底，尽可能的使其权利划一；另外还规定了“铺底权”人对铺房有优先购买权；对于倒来不久收益无多、或在创设“铺底权”时曾与房东有代价者，在其将铺房转租与第三者营业使用者，房东需予“铺底权”人适当补偿。对于租用有“铺底权”铺房的第三者，也保证了他的继续承租权与优先购买权。这些措施既保护了房东的产权，又保护了工商业者对铺房的使用权；充分地贯彻了保护房屋与发展工商业的政策，使房东与工商业者获得了莫大的利益。因而这个办法一定能够合理地解决现存的“铺底权”纠纷。但因“铺底权”由来已久，情况复杂，这个试行办法不可能全部解决所有的“铺底权”纠纷，故在处理过程中还要根据具体情况加以补充修正。希望房东与“铺底权”人双方都按照这个试行办法的精神自行合理解决。
