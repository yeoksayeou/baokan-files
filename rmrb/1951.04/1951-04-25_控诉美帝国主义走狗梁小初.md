　　Accusation Against Liang Xiaochu, Running Dog of U.S. Imperialism
　　Jiang Wenhan, Deputy General Secretary of the National Association of Chinese YMCA

　　Liang Xiaochu, who worked in the Chinese YMCA for nearly forty years, from the standpoint of the people of our new China today, is a loyal tool who willingly served U.S. imperialism. During his tenure as General Secretary of the National Association of the YMCA, he closely colluded with the North American YMCA Association, making the Chinese YMCA directly or indirectly serve U.S. imperialism, and carried out the propaganda of worshiping, being friendly to, and fearing the U.S. among Chinese intellectuals.

　　Liang Xiaochu has always valued American secretaries and belittled Chinese colleagues. He always appointed American secretaries to many important positions in the National Association of the YMCA; he rarely consulted with Chinese responsible colleagues on many important decisions regarding the YMCA's policies; on the contrary, he always accepted the opinions of American secretaries. Among the American secretaries, many were doing intelligence and espionage work for the U.S. government. For example, Mr. and Mrs. Fei Wusheng openly colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the Syngman Rhee puppet; Luo Aihua carried out U.S. imperialist activities to invade China in Guangzhou; and Hu Laiming went to Northwest China under the guise of studying Islam to do intelligence work. These U.S. imperialist elements, although they returned to their country before and after liberation, continued to carry out propaganda to slander New China among the American people.

　　Liang Xiaochu is a typical so-called "high-class Chinese." He turned the YMCA into a completely Westernized organization: meetings were held in English, records were kept in English, reports were written in English, and even the charter of the National Association of the YMCA was translated from English. Once, in a meeting, he said to a representative from the interior, "You can speak in Chinese." He was no longer Chinese!

　　During Liang Xiaochu's term in the National Association of the YMCA, the finances were never made public. We, colleagues who had worked in the association for many years, did not understand the association's financial situation until recently when the government handled the registration of religious organizations.

　　After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Liang Xiaochu went to the United States several times for activities. When Shanghai was about to be liberated, he insisted on resigning in the name of "retirement," before the successor general secretary took office. After he fled to Hong Kong, he cooperated with the U.S. imperialist policy of using world Christian organizations to enslave the people of Asia, and successively held positions in the Asian regions of the World Council of Churches and the World Alliance of YMCAs, carrying out activities that violated the interests of all Asian people. At the Asian Conference of the World Council of Churches held in Bangkok in November 1949, Liang Xiaochu made reactionary remarks, such as calling the liberation of the Chinese people led by the Chinese Communist Party "Chinese imperialism." In the February issue of the World YMCA Monthly this year, Liang Xiaochu published an article calling New China "Communist China," and said that the freedom of the Chinese people has been restricted. He also said that the YMCA cannot raise funds in New China; however, in fact, the recent fundraising campaign of the Shanghai YMCA exceeded its target by 400 million yuan.

　　Last August, the World YMCA held a meeting in Denmark and sent a letter in advance requesting the Chinese YMCA to send representatives to participate. We immediately replied that we would not send representatives and did not agree to invite any overseas Chinese to serve as representatives. However, Liang Xiaochu, without our consent, claimed to represent the Chinese YMCA at the meeting and sent a letter to question us. At that meeting, they used the work of Korean prisoners of war as a cover, attempting to go to North Korea to conduct espionage activities for the United States; and refused to pass the Stockholm Peace Appeal.

　　We should make a serious accusation against Liang Xiaochu, such a loyal tool who willingly serves U.S. imperialism. We ourselves should also review that we were deeply exploited by U.S. imperialism in the past and failed to realize it earlier. From now on, all YMCA colleagues should strengthen our vigilance, resolutely sever ties with U.S. imperialism, eliminate all influences of U.S. imperialism, and enable the Chinese YMCA to move towards a bright future under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the People's Government.

　　控诉美帝国主义走狗梁小初
    中华基督教青年会全国协会副总干事　江文汉
    曾经在中国基督教青年会干过将近四十年的梁小初，从我们今天新中国人民的立场来看，是一个甘心服役于美帝国主义的忠实工具。他在充当青年会全国协会总干事的期间，紧密地勾结了北美青年会协会，使中国青年会直接或间接地服役于美帝国主义，在中国知识分子当中，进行崇美、亲美、恐美思想的宣传。
    梁小初一向就是重视美国干事和轻视中国同工的。青年会全国协会中许多重要职位，他总是委任美国干事担任的；许多关于青年会政策的重要决定，他很少和中国负责同工商量，相反的，他总是接受美国干事的意见。在美国干事当中，不少是替美国政府做情报特务工作的。像费吴生夫妇，公开地勾结蒋匪帮和李承晚傀儡；骆爱华在广州进行美帝国主义侵略中国的活动；胡籁明以研究回教为名，到中国的西北做情报工作。这些美帝国主义分子，虽然在解放前后都回了国，然而他们还在美国人民中继续进行诽谤新中国的宣传。
    梁小初是一个典型的所谓“高等华人”，他把青年会搞成一个十足洋化的机关：开会用英文，记录用英文，报告用英文，连青年会全国协会的宪章也是从英文翻译出来的，甚至在一次会议里，他对内地一位代表说，“你可以用中文讲。”他已经不是中国人了！
    梁小初在青年会全国协会的任期内，经济从来就不公开，我们在协会多年的同工，直到最近政府办理宗教团体登记的时候，才了解协会的经济情况。
    梁小初在抗日战争胜利后，几次往美国活动。等到上海快要解放的时候，他以“告老退休”的名义，坚持在继任总干事还未就任以前离职。当他跑到香港以后，就配合着美帝国主义利用世界性的基督教团体奴役亚洲人民的政策，先后担任了世界基督教教会协会和世界基督教青年会协会亚洲区的职务，进行违犯全亚洲人民利益的活动。一九四九年十一月在曼谷召开的世界基督教教会协进会的亚洲会议中，梁小初发表反动的言论，比如他把中国共产党所领导的中国人民解放，说成是“中国帝国主义”，在今年二月份的世界青年会月刊里，梁小初又发表了一篇文章，把新中国说成是“共产党中国”，又说中国人民的自由，已经受了限制。他又说青年会在新中国无法募捐，然而事实上最近上海青年会的征募运动，就超出了目标四亿元。
    去年八月世界青年会在丹麦举行了一个会议，事先来信要中国青年会派遣代表参加，我们立即回信申明不派代表，并不赞同邀请任何国外的中国人充当代表。然而梁小初未得我们的同意，自称代表中国青年会出席该会，并且来信质问我们。在那次会议里，他们假名朝鲜战俘工作，企图到北朝鲜替美国做间谍活动；并拒绝通过斯德哥尔摩和平呼吁书。
    像梁小初这样甘心服役于美帝国主义的忠实工具，我们应当提出严重的控诉。我们自己也要检讨过去深深被美帝国主义所利用，未能早日觉悟。今后我们全体青年会同工应当加强警惕，切实割断与美帝国主义的关系，肃清美帝国主义的一切影响，使中国的青年会，在毛主席与人民政府领导下，走向光明的前途。
