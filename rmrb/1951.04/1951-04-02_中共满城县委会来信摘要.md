Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    To the Editors:
    We agree with Comrade He Luofeng's self-criticism this time. We sent people to Comrade He Luofeng's hometown, Xiyuanpo Village in Mancheng County, to conduct an investigation. According to the results of the investigation, some of the situations reflected in the "Letters from Readers" do not correspond with the facts. For example, the "Letters from Readers" said that there was a saying circulating among the villagers in the surrounding villages: "There is an Old Man in the Sky, and there is He Luofeng on the ground." This is not in accordance with the facts. Comrade Luofeng's style has always been relatively democratic, and he has a very straightforward temperament. This is understood by comrades who work with Comrade Luofeng. And the masses in the village and surrounding villages did not have those circulating sayings. Also, regarding the issue of embezzling fruits, our investigation shows that it is also not true. The County Committee did not explain these two matters in the investigation report to the Baoding Prefectural Committee last July when the People's Daily asked the Baoding Prefectural Committee to investigate whether the readers' criticisms of Comrade Luofeng were correct. This is something for which the County Committee should be held responsible for self-criticism.
    Regarding the issue of selling land, we believe that Comrade Luofeng's family did have financial difficulties at the time; however, he should have raised this with the leadership so that a solution could be found. Comrade Luofeng's sale of land that had been distributed not long before had a negative impact.
    Regarding the issue of asking a Feng Shui master to look at Feng Shui, Comrade Luofeng did not stop this after discovering it, but adopted a sympathetic attitude. This shows that Comrade Luofeng does indeed have superstitious and backward ideas. This is the result of Comrade Luofeng's usual lack of study and lack of political development.
    We have not provided enough help to Comrade Luofeng in the past, which has prevented him from quickly overcoming his backward ideas. In the future, in addition to helping Comrade Luofeng to further deeply recognize his mistakes and correct them, we will also help Comrade Luofeng strengthen his studies in order to thoroughly overcome his remaining peasant backward ideas.
                                       CCP Mancheng County Committee, Hebei Province

### 中共满城县委会来信摘要

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中共满城县委会来信摘要编辑同志：
    我们同意何洛丰同志这次的检讨。我们曾派人到何洛丰同志的家乡——满城县西原坡村进行调查。根据调查结果，《读者来信》所反映的情况，有一部分是和事实不符的。例如《读者来信》中说，在附近村庄老乡中流传着：“天上有个老天爷，地下有个何洛丰。”这与事实不符。洛丰同志的作风一贯比较民主，他的性情很直爽。这是与洛丰同志一块工作的同志都了解的。而该村及附近村庄群众并未有那些流传的话。又如私吞果实问题，经我们调查，也非事实。这两件事，在去年七月人民日报请保定地委调查读者对洛丰同志批评是否正确时，县委会在给地委的调查报告中都未说明。这是县委会应当负责检讨的。
    关于卖地问题，我们认为当时洛丰同志家庭生活确有困难；但他应向领导上提出，以便设法解决。洛丰同志当时出卖分得不久的土地，影响是不好的。
    关于请阴阳先生看风水问题，洛丰同志发觉此事后未加制止，却采取了同情的态度。这说明洛丰同志确有迷信落后意识。这是洛丰同志平时不爱学习、政治上不开展的结果。
    我们平时对洛丰同志的帮助不够，使其落后意识未能迅速克服。今后我们除应帮助洛丰同志更进一步地深刻认识错误并予改正外，还要帮助洛丰同志加强学习，以彻底克服其残余的农民落后意识。
                                       中共河北省满城县委会
