To the Editor:

There are eighteen private livestock breeding stations in Wei County, Chahar, raising a total of sixteen stallions and thirty male donkeys. The existence of these private livestock breeding stations is beneficial for breeding livestock. For this reason, the Wei County People's Government has provided assistance such as loans to private livestock breeding stations. However, the People's Government has not provided sufficient business guidance to private livestock breeding stations, so the following problems still exist in private livestock breeding stations:

(1) The operators are not technically proficient. Most of the twenty-nine public livestock operators at the eighteen private livestock breeding stations are mainly engaged in agriculture and also engaged in public livestock breeding. They lack sufficient knowledge of the selection, cultivation, and use of public livestock, and also lack experience in the diseased state of female livestock (such as cold and heat diseases of the uterus) and the time of mating. Therefore, there are many cases of failure to conceive after mating; last year, two male donkeys and one stallion died from improper mating, one donkey was kicked, and two mares died from diseases contracted during mating. Moreover, because the owner of the public livestock can get 1.5 dou of millet for each mating (if the animal does not conceive, mating can continue for free), sometimes there is a phenomenon that the public livestock is mated too much in order to earn millet, and the female livestock cannot be fertilized.

(2) Public livestock does not meet standards. Among the forty-six public livestock in the county, there is one stallion and three donkeys over eighteen years old; only five small donkeys that are only two years old; nine stallions with diseases, and a large number of small and short donkey foals. Some of these public livestock have lost their fertility, and some, although fertile, are of poor quality.

(3) Those operating public livestock breeding stations have traditional conservative ideas and are often unwilling to spread experience and technology to the outside world. This hinders the improvement of livestock breeding technology.

Southern Chahar was originally a region with more livestock, but after the devastation by the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the lack of animal power has become a widespread and serious problem. Therefore, doing a good job in livestock breeding is of great significance at present.

### 蔚县私营种畜站应加改进

　　蔚县私营种畜站应加改进编辑同志：
    察哈尔蔚县共有私营种畜站十八处，共养公马十六匹，公驴三十头。这些私营种畜站的存在，对于繁殖牲畜是有益处的，为此，蔚县人民政府对私营种畜站曾给以贷款等帮助。但是人民政府对于私营种畜站的业务指导是做得不够的，因此私营种畜站现在还存在以下一些问题：
    （一）经营人员技术不熟练。十八处私营种畜站的二十九名公畜经营人员，大部分是以农业为主兼营公畜配种的。他们对公畜的选购、培养、使用缺乏足够的知识，对母畜的病态（如子宫冷热病等），交配时间，也缺乏经验。因此在交配以后不怀胎的次数很多；在去年并曾因交配不当，累死公驴两头，公马一匹，踢伤驴一匹，交配得病而死的母马有两匹。而且因为交配一次，公畜主可得小米一斗五升（如不怀胎，可继续免费交配），所以有时就发生为了挣小米而使公畜交配过多，母畜不能受精的现象。
    （二）公畜不合标准。全县四十六匹公畜中，有十八年以上的老公马一匹，驴三匹；仅够两岁的小驴五匹；带病的公马九匹，还有很大一部分身体低矮的小公驴驹。这些公畜中有的已失去生殖力，有的虽有生殖力，但素质低劣。
    （三）经营公畜配种站的有传统的保守思想，经验和技术常不肯向外传播。这样就妨碍了牲畜配种技术的提高。
    察哈尔南部原是畜产较多的地区，但是经过日寇和蒋匪的摧残，畜力缺乏已成为一个普遍而严重的问题。因此，搞好牲畜配种工作，在目前具有很重大的意义。
