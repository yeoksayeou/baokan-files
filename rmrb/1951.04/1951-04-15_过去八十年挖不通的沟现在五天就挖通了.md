　　A Ditch That Couldn't Be Dug for the Past Eighty Years Is Now Dug Through in Five Days
    To the Editor:
    The Ren Ditch in the Northwest Township of Fuliqu District, Suxian County, Northern Anhui, is a ditch that has not been dug through for eighty years. Now we have dug it through in five days. This was originally a small ditch, and it can also be said to be a small matter; however, from this small matter, we can see the changes in the countryside.
    This ditch is not long, only the fields of four villages, Daqin, Qiling, Dacai, and Fengwei, can rely on it for irrigation. The farmers in these four villages wanted to dig through this ditch eighty years ago, but the landlords didn't care about these things. In their view, it didn't benefit them, so they wouldn't allow the digging. If they didn't allow it, the farmers couldn't dig it. In the second year of Guangxu, the farmers of the four villages jointly prepared five tables of good wine and invited the big landlord Zhao Laomian, but it was all in vain. Later, the farmers of Fengwei Village fought a lawsuit with the landlord, but they ended up like moths flying into a flame.
    After liberation, the People's Government took the lead for the farmers, and things became easier. Last winter, the People's Government helped the farmers with the organizational work of digging the ditch, and after the work started, the Ren Ditch, which had not been dug through for eighty years, was dug through within five days.

### 过去八十年挖不通的沟现在五天就挖通了

　　过去八十年挖不通的沟现在五天就挖通了编辑同志：
    皖北宿县符离区西北乡的任沟，是条八十年没有挖通的沟。现在我们五天就把它挖通了。这本来是一条小沟，这也可以说是一件小事；但是，就从这件小事上，可以看出农村的变化。
    这个沟也不长，只有大秦、戚岭、大蔡、冯圩等四个村子的田地可以靠它灌溉。这四个村子的农民在八十年前就想挖通这条沟，但是地主是不管这些的，他看来对自己没油水，就不叫挖。他们不叫挖，农民就挖不成了。光绪二年，四个村的农民合办了五桌好酒，请了大地主赵老勉，结果还是白搭。后来冯圩村的农民又和地主打了一场官司，也落得个飞蛾投火。
    解放后，人民政府给农民作主，事情就好办了。去年的冬天，人民政府帮助农民进行了挖沟的组织工作，开工后，五天之内就把这条八十年挖不通的任沟挖通了。
