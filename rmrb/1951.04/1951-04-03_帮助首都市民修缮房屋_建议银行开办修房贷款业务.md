    Helping Beijing Citizens Repair Houses
    Suggest Banks Open Housing Repair Loan Services
    To the Editor:
    Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi mentioned the housing difficulties of the people in the capital in his speech at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing. I was very moved after reading it: the People's Government is truly a government that relieves the people's suffering, and the people's leaders care so much about the people's immediate problems.
    The housing shortage in the capital, like many other disasters, was left over by the Kuomintang reactionaries. During the reactionary rule, prices rose several times a day, and the landlords' rental income was not enough to pay the reactionary government's taxes. Houses were in disrepair, so the phenomenon of dilapidated houses was everywhere, which caused the current difficulty of insufficient housing.
    Today, the People's Government is determined to vigorously solve the housing shortage, and we strongly support it. I suggest that the government use loans to encourage and help private individuals repair houses so that all dilapidated houses can be repaired in a timely manner. The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China should find ways to open housing repair loan services. This will prevent the original houses from collapsing; in addition to the 15,000 to 20,000 new houses built this year, the housing problem in the capital can be solved.
                                            Wu Guorui et al.

### 帮助首都市民修缮房屋  建议银行开办修房贷款业务

    帮助首都市民修缮房屋
    建议银行开办修房贷款业务编辑同志：
    刘少奇副主席在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话，提到了首都人民住房困难问题。我读后非常感动：人民政府真正是为人民解除疾苦的政府，人民的领袖是这样地关怀着人民的切身问题。
    首都的房荒，和其他许多灾害一样，是国民党反动派遗留下来的。在反动统治时期，物价一日数涨，房主们的房租收入还不够缴纳反动政府的捐税，房屋失修，因此，败瓦颓垣的现象触目皆是，这就造成了目前房屋不敷的困难。
    今天，人民政府决心大力解决房荒，我们非常拥护。我建议政府用贷款方式，鼓励和帮助私人修缮房屋，使所有破旧房屋都及时得到修建。中国人民银行北京分行应设法开办修建房屋贷款业务。这样就可使原有的房屋不致坍毁；再加上本年新建的一万五千间到两万间房屋，首都的房屋问题，是能够得到解决的。
                                            武国瑞等
