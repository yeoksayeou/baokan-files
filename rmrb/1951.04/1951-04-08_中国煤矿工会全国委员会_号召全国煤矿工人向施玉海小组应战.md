　　Calls on Coal Miners Nationwide to Respond to the Challenge from the Shi Yuhai Group

Xinhua News Agency: The All-China Coal Miners' Trade Union National Committee issued a call on the 1st to coal miners nationwide, urging them to respond to the challenge from the Shi Yuhai Safe Production Group. The call pointed out: The challenge and competition put forward by the Shi Yuhai Safe Production Group to coal miners in Northeast China and across the country is a further development of the patriotic safe production competition movement of coal mine workers and staff. Coal mine trade union organizations at all levels should study and become familiar with the experience of the Shi Yuhai Safe Production Group, put forward different conditions for responding to the challenge based on the different circumstances of various mining areas and businesses, and carry out the response in an organized, prepared, and focused manner, so as to more deeply promote the patriotic safe production competition of coal mine workers and staff, and consolidate the grassroots organizations of coal mine trade unions. Coal mine trade union organizations at all levels should also pay attention to drawing on the experience of the safe production competition movement since October of last year, and combine the organization of the response with in-depth anti-US aggression and aid-Korea current affairs education and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries.
