　　Strictly Prevent Reactionary Landlords from Exploiting Loopholes
　　Landlord Lü Youze, Who Murdered Five People in Lingbao County, Attempted to Infiltrate the Revolutionary Ranks and Has Been Arrested by the Government
Editor:
　　In the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries or carry out land reform, many heinous counter-revolutionaries and local bullies often evade the struggle and flee to the cities, using various connections to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks and continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities.
　　Lü Youze, a lawless landlord from Lingbao County, Henan Province, who murdered five people, fled to Beijing on January 12th and sought out his cousin, Li Hong. Li Hong was the section chief of the Reception Section of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. At the time, he was busy with work and, due to ideological paralysis, as well as being away from home for a long time and not understanding the situation, he was blinded by the kinship and Lü's flowery words. He not only allowed Lü to stay in the reception center but also intended to introduce him to work. Fortunately, when introducing him to work, Comrade Li Hong paid attention and wrote to the Lingbao County People's Government to inquire about Lü's situation. After receiving Comrade Li Hong's letter, the Lingbao County Government immediately telegraphed the relevant departments to arrest him and wrote to Comrade Li Hong saying: "Lü Youze is the main culprit in the murder of five members of Li Huchen's family, members of the Dongcun Farmers' Association in 1947. Our county arrested him last year, but when the village farmers' association escorted him back to the village for struggle, he took the opportunity to escape due to negligent custody." The fugitive Lü Youze has now been arrested by the public security department. Comrade Li Hong has conducted a self-criticism for his ideological paralysis and blurred stance and has requested the leadership to impose a penalty.
　　This incident tells us that revolutionary cadres should be highly vigilant and not be blinded by relationships with relatives, friends, and fellow villagers. In addition, I also suggest that the personnel departments of various agencies should keep abreast of the situation of guests staying with cadres in their agencies and not become "air raid shelters" for fugitive landlords and counter-revolutionaries.

　　严防反动地主钻空子
    灵宝县杀害五条人命的地主吕有泽企图混入革命阵营已被政府逮捕编辑同志：
    在镇压反革命或进行土地改革的斗争中，很多罪大恶极的反革命分子及恶霸地主往往逃避斗争而逃亡到城市，并利用种种关系钻到革命队伍内部，继续进行反革命活动。
    河南省灵宝县杀过五条人命的不法地主吕有泽，一月十二日潜逃到北京，找他的表亲李弘。李弘是中央人民政府农业部招待科科长，当时他正忙于工作，加以思想麻痹，及离家日久、不了解情况，竟被亲戚关系和吕犯的花言巧语所蒙蔽，不但留吕犯住在招待所里，而且还要给他介绍工作。幸好在介绍工作时，李弘同志注意了一下，写信给灵宝县人民政府询问吕犯的情况。灵宝县政府接到李弘同志的信后，即电请有关部门予以逮捕，并写信给李弘同志说：“吕有泽是一九四七年杀死洞村农会会员李虎臣一家五口人的主要凶手。咱县去年就把他逮捕了；但在该村农会押他回村斗争时，因管押疏忽，他乘机逃跑。”现逃犯吕有泽已经公安部门逮捕。李弘同志对自己思想麻痹、立场模糊，已作了检讨，并请求领导上给予处分。
    这件事情告诉我们，革命干部应该有高度警惕，不要被亲属、朋友、同乡等关系所蒙蔽。此外，我还建议各机关的人事部门，应该随时了解本机关干部所留客人情况，不要当逃亡地主、反革命分子的“防空洞”。
