　　The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement Changes the Face of Work

    The Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement in Linru County, Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, has achieved significant results in the four and a half months since it began last November. The tired and negative emotions of some cadres and the desire to "change shifts and go home" have been largely resolved; the blind fear of the U.S. and worship of the U.S. among cadres and the masses, fearing a third world war and the atomic bomb, have also been fundamentally changed. At the same time, rumors have subsided, landlords and bullies have bowed their heads, popular sentiment has surged, and social order is more stable than ever before.

    Based on the patriotic ideology of resisting America and aiding Korea, the broad masses shouted the slogans: "No more being slaves of a fallen nation" and "Absolutely not being cowards." Farmers throughout the county have launched a patriotic upsurge of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Defending the Home and Defending the Country" and "Protecting the land and protecting our rice bowls"; within seven days, more than 2,000 young people applied to join the Volunteer Army; young students also applied to join military cadre schools; many model cases of fathers sending sons and wives sending husbands to join the army have appeared in various places. More than 70% of the masses throughout the county have been drawn into the upsurge of the movement.

    The movement has now entered a deeper stage and is currently establishing anti-American patriotic covenants and carrying out patriotic production increase competitions among the masses of all strata. Farmers throughout the county have established patriotic production increase plans. The patriotic production increase competition has gradually expanded from labor models to the masses, and 30% of the population in individual villages has participated in the production competition movement. Under the promotion of this movement, the cotton planting area throughout the county has exceeded last year's by 37% (from 146,000 mu to 200,000 mu); the past habit of not weeding wheat universally has also been changed. At present, except for late wheat, it has been weeded once or twice, and some have been weeded three times. Some women who have never participated in agricultural labor in the past are now also participating, fundamentally reversing the feudal consciousness that women working in the fields is "shameful." This year, on the "March 8th" International Women's Day, 94,500 women throughout the county participated in rallies, denouncing the atrocities of the Japanese invaders, American imperialists, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and held demonstrations. Their status in the family and society has also been greatly improved. The farmers know the principle that increasing production by 10% is to resist America and aid Korea, and regard all kinds of production as resisting America and aiding Korea. Therefore, the call to increase production by another 10% this year has become the actual action of the broad masses; individual mutual aid groups have proposed to increase production by 20%; first-class labor model Xu Niuwa has formulated a production increase plan of "cultivating three and saving one."

    In the anti-American patriotic movement, a new upsurge of cultural movement has also emerged. After being liberated, the broad masses of farmers urgently need to learn culture. At present, 25,375 men and women (workers, farmers, and citizens) throughout the county have voluntarily joined the literacy movement. The number of primary school students has increased by 32% on the basis of 25,000 last year. A 62-year-old woman and a child have also made a study plan. Individual masses have launched a husband and wife learning competition. Liberated farmers not only demand to learn culture, but also demand recreational activities. On "March 8th" alone, 550 women in one district participated in cultural and recreational activities; 16 elderly women over 45 years old also participated in cultural entertainment such as twisting the Yangko and dressing up as land boats. Now, the books needed by farmers in Xinhua Bookstore are in short supply, and more than 31,000 copies of farmers' literacy textbooks have been distributed, which is still not enough.

  The Process and Main Experiences of the Movement

    The movement can be roughly divided into two stages:

    The first stage: from last November to the end of January this year, was the stage of ideological education and practical action.

    The second stage: from mid-February to the present, the movement has been deepened to carry out the anti-American patriotic production increase competition and to establish patriotic covenants, so that the movement has entered a normal state.

    The main experiences are as follows:

    1. First, arm the minds of cadres and the masses from top to bottom and from inside to outside, and then launch a mass grievance movement from bottom to top. This is the main key to eliminating all confused thoughts and correcting the pacifist and paralyzed thoughts of cadres and the masses, and is also the first pass in the development of the movement. Before the movement, the thoughts of cadres and the masses in the county were extremely chaotic. Many old cadres were ideologically paralyzed and indifferent in the first stage of the Korean War. Some new cadres blindly feared the U.S. after the U.S. invading troops landed in Incheon, so they did not dare to publicize the situation, fearing that the masses' thoughts would fluctuate. Those who were determined were prepared to follow the Communist Party, and those who were not determined expressed negativity. Intellectuals, due to the deep pro-American education of the Kuomintang reactionaries, turned from blind worship of the U.S. to serious fear of the U.S., and after the Korean War entered a new stage, they maintained a neutral wait-and-see attitude. The peasants were panic-stricken and uneasy. Therefore, reversing the thoughts of cadres and the masses was a major issue and became the starting point for all work. The specific methods were to hold cadre meetings, training courses, various representative meetings, and forums (the county and districts have held 83 representative meetings and forums, with a total of 17,150 participants, including those who attended the meetings repeatedly). The specific method was: first, the leaders spoke about the current situation, analyzed the situation, and inspired the denunciation of the crimes of the Japanese invaders, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and American imperialism, and launched a grievance movement. On this basis, everyone freely debated, exposed and resolved confused thoughts, finally expressed their attitudes, organized practical anti-American patriotic actions, and implemented the current specific work. The outstanding experience was: mobilizing all cadres to participate in the grievance, and then leading the cadres to widely carry out a mass grievance movement. In development, it was universally expanded from men to women, from cadres to the masses, and from adults to children, thus reversing the idea that cadres thought the masses had been liberated and "forgotten their roots" and could not complain, and the idea that the masses thought complaining was shameful. After the cadres had complained, their emotions changed from negative to positive. At that time, among the 203 cadres directly under the county government, 153 applied to join the army and military cadre schools. After the masses complained, they shouted the call of "No more being slaves of a fallen nation" and "Absolutely not being cowards," and they all demanded to join the army to avenge their hatred. After the women complained, they proposed to sign up to send their sons and husbands to join the army and actively donate money to comfort the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. Women throughout the county donated a total of 7,473,100 yuan and 53,306 items of supplies, and 1,473 letters of condolence. Through the complaint, the cadres and the masses established anti-American ideas, but the fear of the U.S. and the worship of the U.S. still remained in some cadres. Through the comparison of the two major camps in the world, especially through the comparison of the farmers and cadres with their own personal experiences, the fear of the U.S. was eliminated and their confidence in victory was enhanced. The stories of battles told by honorary soldiers and veterans had a greater effect. The blind fear of the U.S. and worship of the U.S. among farmers and intellectuals were also basically resolved in the complaint.

    2. Combine it with specific work, and take resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the home and the country as the driving force of all work to promote all work forward. For example, in the struggle against counter-seizure during the issuance of land certificates, the peasants complained that the U.S. helped Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war, seized strong men, and forced food and forced payment, causing the peasants to be forced to flee famine, beg for food, and sell their children. The peasants said: "In the past, we only knew that the root of poverty was in Chiang Kai-shek, but who knew that the root was still in the U.S." This greatly inspired the masses' anti-American sentiment.

    3. The reason why the movement can be carried out so widely and deeply is due to the correct guidance of the superior party, the importance of leadership, and the participation of the entire party. This is the most basic link in the development of the movement. Since last November, the county party committee itself first clarified that the current affairs propaganda of resisting America and aiding Korea is one of the central tasks of the party and is the driving force for various tasks. Therefore, the county party committee convened various meetings to conduct ideological mobilization. The county magistrate, the secretary of the county party committee, the district chief, and the secretary of the district party committee personally helped more than 50 first- and second-class labor models to establish patriotic production increase plans and helped initiate a production increase competition. From last November to the present, only 30 people, including the secretary of the county party committee, the county magistrate, the minister of propaganda, the secretary of the district party committee, and the district chief, have made 540 current affairs reports.

    4. It is necessary to constantly summarize experience, improve the ideological level of cadres, and eliminate ideological obstacles in the movement. Because some cadres do not have enough understanding of the task of resisting America and aiding Korea as a long-term struggle, as the situation improves, they have the idea of ​​taking a breath, such as thinking that "the situation is not tight, the U.S. cannot come," "we cannot engage in anti-American patriotic movements every day," "there is a lot of work below, and there is no time to implement it," and so on. After the county party committee of the Communist Party of China discovered this problem, it first made a review and unified its understanding; it also convened department meetings and expanded cadre meetings at the end of February and the beginning of March, and the district also convened township cadre meetings to summarize and deploy the movement, and the anti-American movement entered a deeper stage.

    5. Establish an organization, unify leadership, and form an army of thousands of propaganda troops. Last winter, the county established district and township propaganda committees from top to bottom to unify the leadership of the propaganda organization, and printed and distributed 15,000 copies of various propaganda materials as the basis for the oral propaganda of the propaganda team, and unified the propaganda content.

  Several Issues to be Resolved

    1. Due to the lack of knowledge, theory, and cultural level of cadres, the anti-American patriotic ideology of the entire party is still far from the requirements. Therefore, continuously arming the minds of cadres should become a regular task for leading cadres.

    2. Although the party's propagandists have been established in the movement, the number and role are still lagging behind the requirements of the movement. In the future, we must strive to expand the number of propagandists and improve the quality of propagandists through the movement.

    3. There must be some more popular propaganda materials. At present, cadres above the district level cannot finish studying the materials, and mass propaganda materials are not enough.

    4. Although the patriotic production increase competition has been launched from point to surface, it is necessary to prevent the occurrence of formalism.

　　中共临汝县委关于抗美援朝运动的总结
    中共许昌地委办公室
    抗美援朝运动改变了工作面貌
    河南省许昌专区临汝县抗美援朝爱国运动，自去年十一月开始，四个半月来，已有显著成绩。部分干部的疲蹋消极情绪和想“换班回家”的思想，已基本得到解决；干部、群众怕三次世界大战，怕原子弹的盲目恐美和崇美的思想，也得到根本改变。同时谣言平息，地主恶霸低头，群情高涨，社会秩序空前安定。
    在抗美援朝的爱国思想基础上，广大群众喊出：“不再当亡国奴”，“决不当孬种”的口号。全县农民掀起了“抗美援朝保家卫国”、“保田保饭碗”的爱国高潮；七天内即有二千余名青年群众要求参加志愿军；青年学生也纷纷申请要求参加军事干部学校；各地出现了许多父送子、妻送夫参军的模范事例。全县有百分之七十以上的群众卷入了运动高潮。
    目前运动已进入更深入的阶段，现正在各阶层群众中订立反美爱国公约及开展爱国增产竞赛。全县农民纷纷订立爱国增产计划。爱国增产竞赛，已由劳动模范到群众逐步展开，个别村庄已有百分之三十的人口，投入生产竞赛运动。在这一运动的推动下，全县植棉面积超过去年百分之三十七（由十四万六千亩增加到二十万亩）；过去锄麦不普遍的习惯也已改变，目前除晚麦外，已普遍锄过一遍至二遍，个别锄过三遍。有些妇女历来没有参加农业劳动，现在也参加了，根本上扭转了过去妇女下地干活“骚气”的封建意识。今年“三八”节全县有九万四千五百名妇女分头参加了集会，控诉了日寇及美国帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮的暴行，举行了游行示威。她们在家庭和社会中的地位也已大大提高。农民知道了增产一成就是抗美援朝的道理，把各种生产均称为抗美援朝，由此今年再增产一成的号召，已变为广大人民的实际行动；个别的互助组提出要增产二成；一等劳动模范许牛娃制定了耕三余一的增产计划。
    在反美爱国运动中，同时也出现了一个文化运动的新高潮。广大农民翻身后，学文化已成为他们迫切的要求。目前全县已有二万五千三百七十五名男女群众（工人、农民、市民）自愿地投入识字运动。小学学生在去年两万五千名的基础上，增加了百分之三十二。六十二岁的老大娘与小孩子也订立学习计划。个别群众展开了夫妻学习竞赛。翻了身的农民不仅要求学文化，而且还要求娱乐活动，“三八”节仅一区即有五百五十名妇女投入了文娱活动；有十六名四十五岁以上的老年妇女也参加了扭秧歌、扮旱船等文化娱乐。现在新华书店中农民需要的书籍已供不应求，农民识字课本已发行到三万一千多份，尚不够用。
  运动开展的过程和主要经验
    运动过程大体可分为两个阶段：
    第一阶段：从去年十一月至今年一月底，为思想教育和实际行动阶段。
    第二阶段：从二月中旬至今，把运动更深入一步，开展抗美援朝爱国增产竞赛和订立爱国公约，使运动进入正常化。
    主要经验，有下面几点：
    一、先由上而下，由内而外地武装干部和群众的思想，再自下而上地展开群众诉苦运动，这是消除一切糊涂思想，纠正干部和群众和平麻痹思想的主要关键，也是运动开展的第一关。在运动前，该县干部和群众思想是异常混乱的。不少老干部在朝鲜战争第一阶段是思想麻痹，满不在乎。有些新干部在美国侵朝军队在仁川登陆后，盲目恐美，因而不敢宣传形势，怕群众思想波动。坚决的准备跟着共产党走，不坚决的表示消极。知识分子由于受国民党反动派的亲美教育较深，由盲目的崇美变成了严重的恐美病，朝鲜战争进入新阶段后，他们保持中立观望态度。农民是恐慌害怕，情绪不安。因此扭转干部、群众思想是个重大问题，成为一切工作开展的着手点。其具体方法是开干部会、训练班，各种代表会、座谈会（现县区召开各种代表会、座谈会八十三次，参加会者计达一七一五○人，其中有重复参加会议的）。具体进行办法：先由领导上讲目前形势，分析情况，启发控诉日寇、蒋介石匪帮、美帝国主义的罪行，开展诉苦运动。在此基础上，大家自由争论，暴露和解决糊涂思想，最后表示态度，组织反美爱国的实际行动，贯彻当前具体工作。其中突出经验是：发动全体干部投入诉苦，再由干部带头广泛开展群众性的诉苦运动。在发展上是由男人到妇女，由干部到群众，由成人到儿童普遍展开，从此扭转了干部认为群众已翻身“忘了本”诉不起苦来，和群众认为诉苦丢人等思想。干部经过诉苦后，情绪由消极变为积极，当时在县府直属的二百零三名干部中，申请参军与参加军事干部学校的即达一百五十三人。群众诉苦后喊出：“不再当亡国奴”、“决不当孬种”的呼声，纷纷要求参军复仇。妇女经过了诉苦后，提出了报名送子送夫参军及踊跃捐款慰劳志愿军和朝鲜人民军。全县妇女共捐款七、四七三、一○○元，物资五三、三○六件，慰问信一、四七三封。通过了诉苦，树立了干部群众仇美思想，但恐美崇美思想在部分干部中依然残存着，又通过了世界两大阵营对比，特别是通过农民和干部用自己的切身经验对比，解除了恐美思想，增强了自己的胜利信心。由荣誉军人和退伍军人讲战斗故事，作用更大。农民与知识分子盲目的恐美崇美思想，在控诉中也基本上得到解决。
    二、与具体工作结合进行，把抗美援朝保家卫国作为一切工作原动力，推动一切工作前进。如在颁发土地证时的反复辟的斗争中，农民控诉了美国帮助蒋介石打内战抓壮丁，要粮逼款，造成农民被迫逃荒要饭卖儿卖女的痛苦，农民们说：“过去只知道穷根在蒋介石身上，谁知道总根还在美国身上。”大大启发了群众的反美情绪。
    三、运动所以能如此广泛深入地开展，是由于上级党的指导正确，领导重视，全党动手。这是运动开展最基本的一环。自从去年十一月后，从县委本身首先是明确了抗美援朝的时事宣传，是党的中心工作之一，是各种工作的推动机。因此县委召开了各种会议，进行思想动员。该县县长、县委书记、区长、区委书记亲自帮助五十多个一、二等劳动模范订抗美爱国增产计划，并帮助发起增产竞赛。自去年十一月起到现在，仅县委书记、县长、宣传部长、区委书记、区长等三十人中即作过五百四十次时事报告。
    四、要经常不断地总结经验，提高干部的思想水平，扫除运动中的思想障碍。因为某些干部对抗美援朝是一个长期的斗争任务认识不足，因而随着形势好转，又有松一口气的思想产生，如认为“形势不紧了，美国来不了啦”、“不能天天搞抗美爱国运动”、“下边工作多，无时间贯彻”等。中共县委会发觉此问题后，首先作了检讨，统一了认识；又在二月底和三月初召开了部门会和扩大干部会，区亦召开了乡干部会，将运动作了总结和布置，抗美运动遂进入了一个深入的阶段。
    五、建立机构，统一领导，组成千军万马的宣传大军。去冬该县自上而下成立了区乡宣传委员会，统一领导宣传组织，并印发了各种宣传品一万五千份，以作宣传队伍口头宣传的依据，统一了宣传内容。
  尚待解决的几个问题
    一、由于干部知识少，理论与文化水平低，故全党的抗美爱国思想还距离要求甚远，因此继续不断地武装干部的思想，应成为领导干部的一个经常工作。
    二、运动中虽建立了党的宣传员，但数量上和作用上尚落在运动要求之后，今后必须通过运动，努力扩大宣传员数量，提高宣传员质量。
    三、须有一些较通俗的宣传材料。目前是区以上干部学习材料看不完，群众性宣传教材则不够用。
    四、爱国增产竞赛虽已由点向面展开，但必须防止发生形式主义偏向。
