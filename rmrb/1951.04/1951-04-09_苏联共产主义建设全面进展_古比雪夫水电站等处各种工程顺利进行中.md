　　Soviet Communist Construction Makes All-Round Progress
　　Construction of Various Projects at the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station and Other Locations Proceeding Smoothly
    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th] The Soviet Union's great communist construction projects are making all-round progress. According to TASS: The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station has completed the breakwater built on the upstream of the Volga River, which enables the locks along the bank and the base engineering of the hydroelectric power station below the water surface to proceed smoothly. Workers worked in the severe winter and laid more than 40,000 cubic meters of stone at the bottom of the river. After the ice melts and the water level drops, the construction of the locks will begin.

    At the starting point of the Turkmen Main Canal, Takhia-Tash Cape, many docks have been built, allowing passing ships to moor at any time. The Uzbek Academy of Sciences has organized the first scientific expedition team of 412 people to assist in the work of excavating the canal. They will study soil, water conservancy, geology, and plant cultivation on millions of hectares of land along the canal to prepare a work plan for irrigating desert areas.

    In the construction area of the Volga-Don Canal, Stakhanovite construction workers have built a huge cement factory ahead of schedule. This year, the amount of cement laid by the builders of the hydropower station there will be ten times more than in the past.

    In the main line of the South Ukrainian Canal—from the lock of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station to the village of Terpeniye in Melitopol City—hundreds of topographers, geologists, drilling workers, and others are currently working. They have excavated more than 200 test shafts and taken thousands of test rocks from depths of up to 100 meters to determine the geological conditions of the riverbed area. The work of delineating the riverbanks is progressing. Several exquisite residential areas will soon appear along the canal between Zaporozhye and Melitopol.

    Near the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station, people have been repairing houses destroyed in the war and building new apartments. The first batch of mobile homes has been assembled. In the second quarter, construction of breakwaters and port facilities will begin. Construction of factories, warehouses, and local steel-concrete manufacturing enterprises will begin in April, and construction of socialist residential areas will begin in May. To supply electricity to the construction area, two powerful generators will be transported to the construction area.

    Factories across the country are sending large amounts of machinery to the construction area. 97% of the earthwork on the South Ukrainian Canal will be done by machines. Workers at the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant have sent dozens of electric excavators to the Volga-Don Canal and the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station. Each bucket of this machine can dig three cubic meters of mud, and it can chisel open 450 cubic meters of rock per hour. Each machine can replace 1,300 people. In the Volga-Don Canal project, a new type of giant mooring cable manufactured by the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant has been used, which can replace 10,000 people. Its giant bucket can fit a car. This machine will be further improved after trial use. Shimech, a design engineer at the Ural Machinery Plant and a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, said: "Soviet engineers work for the people. Their horizons are vast and they are accomplishing things that engineers in capitalist countries cannot."

　　苏联共产主义建设全面进展
　  古比雪夫水电站等处
　  各种工程顺利进行中
    【新华社七日讯】苏联的伟大共产主义建设工程全面进展着。据塔斯社讯：古比雪夫水电站已经完成了在伏尔加河的逆流上建筑的防波堤，它使沿岸的水闸和水电站在水面以下的基层工程可以顺利进行。工人在严寒的冬天进行工作，在河底铺上了四万多立方公尺的石块。在河冰溶化水面降低之后，将开始建筑水闸。
    在土库曼大运河的起点塔赫亚·塔什岬，已经建成了许多码头，可使往来的船只随时碇泊。乌兹别克科学院已组织了第一批包括四百十二人的科学考察队前往协助开凿运河的工作，他们将在运河沿线数百万公顷的土地上研究土壤、水利、地质和植物培育，以准备灌溉沙漠地区的工作计划。
    在伏尔加河——顿河运河的建设区，斯塔哈诺夫式的建筑工人已提前建造了一座巨大的水泥制造厂。今年该处水电站的建造者所铺的水泥，要比过去增加十倍。
    在南乌克兰运河的主要干线——从第聂伯水电站的水闸到美利托波尔城的台尔培尼耶村，目前有数百地形学家、地质学家、钻孔工人等在工作着，他们已经挖掘了二百多个试验竖坑，从深达一百公尺的深处取出几千块供试验用的岩石，以测定河道经过地区的地层状况。划定河岸的工作在进展着。若干精美的住宅区即将在萨波罗什到美利托波尔之间的运河沿线上出现。
    在卡霍夫卡水电站附近，人们已在修复战争中毁坏了的房舍并建筑新的公寓。第一批活动房屋已装配完竣。在第二季内将动工建造防波堤和港口设备。四月内要开始建造工厂、仓库以及当地制造钢骨水泥的企业，五月将开始建造社会主义居民区。为了供应建设区的电力，将有两座强大发电机运往建设区。
    全国各地的工厂正以大量的机器送往建设区。南乌克兰运河的土工将有百分之九十七用机器来作。乌拉尔重型机械制造厂的工人，已将数十架电动挖掘机送往伏尔加河——顿河运河和古比雪夫水电站。这种机器每一戽斗能挖泥三立方公尺，每小时能凿开四百五十立方公尺的岩石，每架机器可以代替一千三百人工作。在伏尔加河——顿河运河的工程中，已使用了乌拉尔重型机械厂制造的新式巨大系留索，它可以代替一万人工作，它的巨大戽斗可以放进一部汽车。这种机器试用后还要再加以改进。乌拉尔机械厂的设计工程师、俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃代表希米奇说：“苏联工程师为人民劳动，他们的视野海阔天空，正在完成着资本主义国家工程师所作不到的事情”。
