Learn from the Experience of Xuchang Area and Do a Good Job in the Party's Propaganda Work
The long newsletter "The Propaganda Work of the Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party" published in this newspaper today systematically introduces the Party's propaganda work in one area. It tells us with many specific and vivid facts: How to do a good job in the Party's propaganda work, promote the progress of various practical tasks, and make the Party a strong party with close ties to the broad masses. This contains many important and fundamental experiences that are worth the attention and learning of the entire Party.
Xuchang area was not liberated for long. The entire area was completely liberated and stabilized during the Zhengzhou-Kaifeng Campaign in October 1948. However, in two and a half years, they have established 3,577 mass propaganda teams, including propaganda teams, cultural work teams, and Yangko teams, with 136,060 people participating in these propaganda teams; and since starting to experiment with establishing the Party's propaganda network in July last year, as of March this year, the Party's propagandists have grown to 10,168. Like some other places that have done a good job in propaganda work, the Xuchang local Party organization regularly leads propagandists, unites a strong mass propaganda force, and uses various propaganda tools to carry out propaganda on the situation, policies, and work tasks to the people, so that rumors disappear in urban and rural areas, the people's awareness is constantly improved, and various tasks such as anti-despotism, rent reduction, land reform, resistance to America and aid to Korea, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and development of production are successfully completed. It can be seen that the earliness of liberation and the length of the local Party's history are not the only factors determining the quality of propaganda work. The key lies in whether the Party truly attaches importance to propaganda, regards it as the main method of mobilizing the masses and promoting work, and is good at mobilizing and organizing the power of the entire Party to do propaganda work.
So, what experiences does the Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have in leading propaganda work, and what methods did they take to do a good job in propaganda work?
First, the entire Party attaches importance to propaganda and regards propaganda as one of the main methods of promoting all work and closely linking the Party with the masses. This is the key to the successful development of propaganda work in Xuchang area. The Xuchang Prefectural Committee raised propaganda to the principles of leadership methods and the mass line. Ji Dengkui, Deputy Secretary and Minister of Propaganda of the Prefectural Committee, said: "Propaganda work is the main method for leading organs to mobilize the masses. Without propaganda work, nothing can be accomplished." Because of this correct understanding, when they deploy various tasks, they list propaganda to Party members, the masses, and the people as the primary step in the work process, and discuss how to conduct propaganda at meetings; later, when checking and summarizing work, they also regard propaganda work as one of the important items. When every major work task arrives, they hold enlarged cadre meetings of the Party at all levels to mobilize the power of the entire Party; and they hold various people's representative meetings at all levels to explain the situation, analyze the situation, explain policies, explain tasks, launch discussions, and finally make resolutions, so that the policies and tasks of the Party and the government become the policies and tasks of the people's representatives from all walks of life, and through the people's representatives from all walks of life, mobilize all the people to act in unison for the current work tasks. This systematic propaganda mobilization within and outside the Party is presided over by the main负责人 responsible person of the Party committee. Not only that, the secretaries or deputy secretaries of the prefectural and county committees have personally presided over representative meetings of propagandists or training classes for propaganda personnel to summarize past work experience and formulate future propaganda plans. Because the Party committee attaches importance to propaganda and constantly mobilizes the entire Party to do propaganda work, most cadres have learned to carry out propaganda to the masses in their work. In this way, the propaganda work in Xuchang area has been done well, and the completion of other various practical work tasks has also been guaranteed. This experience is the common experience of all places where propaganda work and mass work are done well.
The reason why propaganda work is not done well in some places now is that the Party committee does not understand the importance of propaganda work, does not understand the connection between propaganda work and all other work, and isolates and neglects this work. They not only do not regard propaganda as a primary and main step in the Party's various work, but regard it as an "extra burden" that is opposed to practical work, and believe that tasks can be completed by relying on orders (sometimes with bonuses in factories), while propaganda is dispensable. Therefore, they push propaganda work to a few staff members in the propaganda department and do not want to intervene themselves, let alone mobilize the entire Party to carry out propaganda work. In this way, propaganda work cannot be developed, and they themselves are divorced from the masses and fall into the quagmire of bureaucracy and commandism. Therefore, whether or not to attach importance to propaganda is an important sign of whether the Party's working methods are correct and whether it relies on the consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses. If we want to overcome the style of forced orders and adopt the method of persuasion and education to the masses to work, we must mobilize the entire Party to carry out propaganda anytime and anywhere. Only when the Party committee takes the lead can propaganda work be truly carried out smoothly.
Second, to make propaganda work regular and exert practical effectiveness, it must be carried out in conjunction with current practical work, and not isolated from various practical work. Propaganda work that deviates from the actual situation and various practical work is dogmatic propaganda work. The masses call this kind of propaganda work propaganda as selling plasters. The biggest feature of propaganda work in Xuchang area is that they never carry out propaganda work in isolation, but regard propaganda work as a driving force for promoting all other work. They use propaganda and education to inspire the people's patriotism and political consciousness, and the result naturally falls on the current various work tasks, and they use uninterrupted propaganda and education to consolidate and improve the people's patriotism and political consciousness to prepare for the next step of work. In this way, work is done step by step, education is carried out once, and the work process becomes a process of propaganda and education for the people. Taking this spring's resistance to America and aid to Korea, harnessing the Huai River, and rural production as examples, when the Xuchang Prefectural Committee deployed this work, it spent two days studying how to link these tasks together. Later, it was decided to first carry out current affairs and political education on resistance to America and aid to Korea, improve the masses' political consciousness and production enthusiasm in the patriotic ideological education movement of resistance to America and aid to Korea, and on this basis, carry out the work of formulating production plans and the patriotic agricultural production increase movement, and mobilize migrant workers to participate in the Huai River harnessing project. As a result, these tasks were not contradictory but interdependent. The movement to resist America and aid Korea has been carried out, and other tasks have been successfully completed.
The reason why propaganda work cannot be carried out in some places now, or it is vigorous for a while and then declines, is that ideological and political propaganda work is not well integrated with various other practical work. In some places, current affairs propaganda is carried out in isolation, without putting forward action slogans to the masses, and without combining it with current practical work tasks (such as suppressing counter-revolutionaries, developing production, etc.), so that the masses' political enthusiasm is aroused but has nowhere to go, and the propaganda movement becomes an empty slogan. In some places, when carrying out various practical work, political propaganda and education are not carried out to the masses. The masses do not know the significance of this work in the country's economic and political life and its relationship with themselves, so they cannot exert revolutionary enthusiasm, and the movement is prone to be deserted. Both of these tendencies must be prevented. Anyone in charge of leadership work should be good at combining ideological and political propaganda work with current practical work when arranging work. Personnel in charge of propaganda work should consciously make ideological and political propaganda work serve various practical work and not "propaganda for the sake of propaganda."
Third, we must mobilize the strength of the Party and non-Party members, "organize a large army of propaganda troops," and launch propaganda activities to the people. The Party organization in Xuchang area is not only good at using the Party's regular propaganda force—the Party's reporters and propagandists, and organizing the Party's strength and the Youth League's strength to the propaganda front to carry out propaganda work, but also good at organizing various social forces and spreading propaganda and education work to every corner through non-Party propaganda organizations. The main mass propaganda organizations in Xuchang area include propaganda teams, cultural work teams, Yangko teams, troupes, reading groups, drawing groups, and youth clubs; the propaganda forms and tools often used include broadcasting tubes, blackboard newspapers, drama performances, reading newspapers, projecting slides, and posting posters. These mass propaganda organizations and forms are led by the township cultural and educational committees in rural areas. The Party's propagandists are planned to be distributed in these mass propaganda organizations and play a backbone role; the secretary or propaganda member of the township branch is often elected as the director or deputy director of the township cultural and educational committee, responsible for the leadership of propaganda work. This makes the Party's propaganda force and the mass propaganda force combined, able to act in unison, and spread the Party's and government's policies and tasks quickly and widely. The experience of Xuchang area tells us that the Party's propaganda force and the mass propaganda force are not only not contradictory but also mutually dependent, and the two have a fish-water relationship. With the Party's propagandists, it is still necessary to organize a large mass propaganda force as one's own hands and feet; and the mass propaganda organization must also have the Party's propagandists as the core to have ideas and content. The statement that the mass propaganda organization has nothing to do after the Party's propagandists are established, or that the Party's propagandists cannot participate in the mass propaganda organization to carry out work, is incorrect.
Fourth, to do a good job in propaganda work, we must establish a regular and systematic leadership system for propaganda work and make these systems truly effective. The Party organization in Xuchang area attaches importance to this aspect, and they have established a set of systems. That is, regularly convening meetings of propagandists and reporters to study mass ideas, discuss the content and methods of propaganda, establish propaganda transmission stations in the area, continuously provide propaganda materials, and plan, check, and summarize propaganda work on a regular basis. The experience of Xuchang area and other places proves that after the leadership system for propaganda work has been established, the most important thing is to persist in it regularly, all meetings must have substantial content, the propaganda materials provided must truly meet the level and needs of the masses, and propaganda personnel should be patiently helped and educated to solve various difficulties in their work, so that propaganda personnel do not feel that propaganda work is too much of a burden or an insurmountable task. To do this, leadership organs at all levels need to send people down from time to time to examine the living and ideological conditions of the masses and the situation of propaganda work, so as to make our propaganda instructions and propaganda materials fit the actual situation and the needs of the masses.
Xuchang area is a place where propaganda work is done relatively well in the Central South District, and it is also one of the places where propaganda work is done relatively well in the country, so we have used a large amount of space to introduce it to the entire Party. In fact, each large administrative region has at least one or two special zones where propaganda work is done relatively well, each special zone also has at least one or two counties that are relatively good, and each county often has one or two villages that are relatively good. The same is true of propaganda work, and the same is true of other Party work. Studying and disseminating these typical experiences is the key point of the leadership method of "from the masses, to the masses" taught to us by Chairman Mao. It is hoped that all localities will regularly summarize and promote the work of those special zones, counties, districts, villages, or cities and factories that have done their work well, and call on other places to learn from their experiences and methods, so that our Party's work will continue to move forward.

### 学习许昌地区经验做好党的宣传工作

　　学习许昌地区经验做好党的宣传工作
    今天本报发表的《中共河南许昌地委的宣传工作》的长篇通讯，有系统地介绍了一个地区的党的宣传工作。它以许多具体生动的事实告诉我们：怎样作好党的宣传工作，推动各项实际工作前进，使党成为强有力的与广大群众有密切联系的党。这中间包含着很多重要的具有基本性质的经验，值得全党重视和学习。
    许昌地区解放并不很久。全区是在一九四八年十月郑州、开封战役时才完全解放和稳定下来的。但在两年半的时间中，它们已经建立起宣传队、文工队、秧歌队等群众性的宣传队三千五百七十七支，参加这些宣传队伍的人员达十三万六千零六十人；而自去年七月开始试验建立党的宣传网后，至今年三月，党的宣传员已发展到一万零一百六十八人。与一些旁的作好了宣传工作的地方一样，许昌地方党组织经常地领导着宣传员，团结着强大的群众性的宣传队伍，运用各种宣传工具，向人民群众进行了形势、政策和工作任务的宣传，使城乡谣言绝迹，人民觉悟不断提高，反恶霸、减租、土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命和发展生产等各种工作都顺利地完成。由此可见，解放的早迟，当地党的历史的长短，并不是决定宣传工作好坏的唯一因素。关键还在于党是否真正重视宣传，把它看作是动员群众和推动工作的主要方法，并善于动员和组织全党力量来作宣传工作。
    那末，中共许昌地委在领导宣传工作上究竟有些什么经验，它们是采取什么方法把宣传工作作好的呢？
    第一、全党重视宣传，把宣传看作是推动一切工作和密切党与群众联系的主要方法之一。这是许昌地区成功地开展宣传工作的关键。许昌地委把宣传提到了领导方法和群众路线的原则上来。地委副书记兼宣传部长纪登奎同志说：“宣传工作是领导机关动员群众的主要方法，不做宣传工作，就会一事无成。”正因为有这种正确的认识，所以他们在布置各项工作时，都把向党员群众和人民群众作宣传列为工作过程中的首要步骤，在会议上都要讨论如何进行宣传；以后检查、总结工作时，又把宣传工作作为重要项目之一。他们在每一个重大的工作任务到来的时候，都逐级召开党的扩大干部会议，以动员全党的力量；又逐级召开各种人民代表会议，讲解形势，分析情况，说明政策，交代任务，发动讨论，最后作出决议，使党和政府的政策和任务，变成各界人民代表自己的政策和任务，通过各界人民代表去动员全体人民为当前的工作任务而一致行动起来。这种党内和党外的有系统的宣传动员，都是由党委的主要负责人主持的。不但这样，地委、县委的书记或副书记，都曾亲自主持宣传员代表大会或宣传人员训练班，总结以往工作经验，订立今后的宣传计划。由于党委重视宣传，经常地动员全党作宣传工作，所以多数干部都学会了在工作中向群众进行宣传。这样，许昌地区的宣传工作作好了，其他各种实际工作任务的完成也都得到了保证。这个经验，是宣传工作和群众工作作得好的一切地方的共同经验。
    现在有些地方宣传工作作得不好，一个最重要的原因，就是党委不了解宣传工作的重要性，不了解宣传工作与其他一切工作的联系，而把宣传工作孤立起来，并忽视这一工作。他们不但不把宣传当作党进行各种工作的一项首先的主要的步骤，反而视为一种与实际工作对立的“额外负担”，认为依靠命令（在工厂中有时加上奖金）就可以完成任务，至于宣传则是可有可无的事。因此，他们把宣传工作推给宣传部门少数工作人员去作，自己不愿过问，自然更不会去动员全党来进行宣传工作。这样，宣传工作既不能开展，他们自身也脱离了群众，陷于官僚主义、命令主义的泥坑。所以，是否重视宣传，是党的工作方法是否正确，是否依靠群众的觉悟性积极性的重要标志。如果我们要克服强迫命令作风，采取对群众说服教育的方法来工作；就必须动员全党随时随地进行宣传。而只有党委亲自带头，宣传工作才能真正顺利地开展起来。
    第二，要使宣传工作经常化，并发挥实际效能，必须与当前各项实际工作结合起来进行，而不要离开各项实际工作孤立地来进行。离开实际情况和各项实际工作的宣传工作，就是教条主义的宣传工作，群众把这种宣传工作叫作卖狗皮膏药的宣传。许昌地区宣传工作的最大特点，就是他们从来不把宣传工作孤立地进行，而是把宣传工作当作推动其他一切工作的一种动力。他们以宣传教育，来启发人民群众的爱国热情和政治觉悟，其结果很自然地落脚在当前的各种工作任务上，而又以不间断的宣传教育，来巩固和提高人民群众的爱国热情和政治觉悟，为下一步工作作准备，这样，工作一步，教育一次，工作过程也就成为对人民群众的宣传教育过程。以今春的抗美援朝、根治淮河和农村生产为例，许昌地委在布置这一工作时曾以两天时间来研究怎样把这些工作扭在一起，后来决定首先进行抗美援朝的时事政治教育，在抗美援朝爱国主义思想教育运动中提高群众的政治觉悟和生产热情，在这个基础上开展订立生产计划的工作和爱国主义农业增产运动，动员民工参加治淮工程。结果，这些工作就不是互相矛盾，而是相依相成的了。抗美援朝运动开展起来了，其他工作也胜利完成。
    现在有些地方宣传工作开展不起来，或者一时轰轰烈烈，随后又消沉下去，就是因为思想政治的宣传工作没有与其他各种实际工作结合得好的缘故。有的地方，孤立地进行时事宣传，不向群众提出行动口号，不与当前实际工作任务（如镇压反革命、发展生产等）结合，以致群众的政治热情发动起来了，却无所归宿，宣传运动变成一阵空喊。也有的地方，在进行各种实际工作时，不向群众进行政治性的宣传教育，群众不知道这种工作在国家经济政治生活中的意义，及其与自己的关系，以致不能发挥革命热情，运动也就容易冷冷清清。这两种偏向都是必须防止的。任何一个负责领导工作的人，在安排工作的时候，都应该善于把思想政治的宣传工作和当前的实际工作结合。而担负宣传工作的人员，应该自觉地使思想政治的宣传工作为各种实际工作服务，不要“为宣传而宣传”。
    第三、必须动员党内党外的力量，“组织千军万马的宣传大军”，向人民群众展开宣传活动。许昌地区党的组织，不仅善于利用党的经常的宣传力量——党的报告员和宣传员，全党的力量和青年团的力量组织到宣传战线上来，进行宣传工作，而且善于组织各种社会力量，通过非党的宣传组织，把宣传教育工作普及到每个角落中去。许昌地区主要的群众性的宣传组织有宣传队、文工队、秧歌队、剧团、读报组、图画组和青年俱乐部等；经常采用的宣传形式和工具有广播筒、黑板报、演戏、读报、放映幻灯、张贴画片等。这些群众的宣传组织和形式，在农村中由乡文教委员会领导。党的宣传员有计划地分布在这些群众的宣传组织中，起着骨干作用；乡支部书记或支部宣传委员往往被推选为乡文教委员会的主任或副主任，负责对于宣传工作的领导。这就使得党的宣传力量和群众的宣传力量结合起来，能够一致行动，把党和政府的政策、任务迅速地、广泛地传播开去。许昌地区的经验告诉我们，党的宣传力量与群众的宣传力量不但并不矛盾而且是互相依靠的，两者有着鱼水般的关系。有了党的宣传员，仍必须组织广大的群众宣传力量，作为自己的手足；而群众的宣传组织，也必须有党的宣传员作为核心，才能有思想，有内容。那种认为建立了党的宣传员，群众的宣传组织就无事可作，或者认为党的宣传员不能参加到群众的宣传组织中去进行工作的说法，都是不正确的。
    第四，要作好宣传工作，必须建立对宣传工作的经常的有系统的领导制度，并使这些制度真正发挥作用。许昌地区党的组织对于这一方面是重视的，他们已经建立了一套制度。这就是经常召开宣传员和报告员的会议，研究群众思想，讨论宣传的内容和方法，建立区的宣传传授站，不断地供给宣传材料，按期计划、检查和总结宣传工作。许昌地区和其他地方的经验都证明，在已经建立了对宣传工作的领导制度以后，最重要的是必须把它经常地坚持下去，各种会议都要有充实的内容，供给的宣传材料要真正适应群众的水平和需要，并且要耐心地帮助和教育宣传员，解决他们工作中的各种困难，不使宣传员感到宣传工作是一个太大的负担或不能胜任的任务。而要做到这样，各级领导机关就需要不时派人到下面去，考查群众的生活和思想状况以及宣传工作的状况，以便使我们的宣传指示和宣传材料切合实际情况和群众需要。
    许昌地区是中南区宣传工作作得比较好的地方，也是全国宣传工作作得比较好的地方之一，所以我们用了较大的篇幅来向全党介绍。事实上每个大行政区都有至少一两个专区的宣传工作作得比较好，每个专区也都至少有一两个县比较好，每个县也往往会有一两个村比较好。宣传工作如此，党的其他工作也莫不如此。研究和传播这些典型经验，这就是毛主席所教给我们的“从群众中来，到群众中去”的领导方法的要点。希望各地方经常将那些工作作得好的专区、县、区、村或是城市、工厂的工作，加以总结和推广，号召其他地方来学习它们的经验和方法，那样我们党的工作就会不断地向前迈进了。
