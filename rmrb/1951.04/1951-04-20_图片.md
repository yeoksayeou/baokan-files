　　Xue Yinghui, a worker representative from the Shanghai Lunchang Yarn Factory, representing all the workers of the factory at the public trial and sentencing meeting convened by the Shanghai Military Control Commission, demanded the execution of the heinous gangster and special agent Wang Songtao. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, Wang, under the guise of a pseudo "Central Market Outpatient Director," extorted vegetable vendors. After the Japanese surrender, he joined the Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau's secret service organization, relying on his power to bully workers and rape female workers; and he used the money embezzled from workers' year-end bonuses to open three rice shops and one egg shop. After liberation, he continued to engage in espionage activities and resisted registration. The Shanghai Military Control Commission accepted the demands of the broad masses, arrested him, and put him on trial. (Photo by Dong Weikun)

　　上海纶昌纱厂工人代表薛映辉，在上海军事管制委员会召开的公审宣判大会上，代表全厂工人，要求枪决罪大恶极的恶霸特务王松涛。王匪在日寇侵占上海期间，即以伪“中央市场外勤主任”名义，对菜贩横加勒索。日寇投降后，他又参加国民党中统特务组织，仗势欺压工人，强奸女工；并拿克扣工人年奖的钱，开了三家米店，一家蛋行。解放后，他继续进行特务活动，抗拒登记。上海军事管制委员会接受广大群众要求，把他逮捕起来审判。（董为焜摄）
