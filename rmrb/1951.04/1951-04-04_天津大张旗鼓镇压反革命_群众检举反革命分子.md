　　[Our Newspaper Dispatch] As a result of Tianjin's vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the political consciousness of the people has rapidly increased, and they have risen to expose counter-revolutionary elements and assist the government in eliminating counter-revolution. Gu Xiulan, a student in the women's literacy class in Xiaoguozhuang, Fourth District of Tianjin, saw a person spreading rumors and intimidating the masses at Han Shuipu No. 113, Xinguanshun Street, on the day that Tianjin executed counter-revolutionary criminals (March 31st). The person, named Wang Delu, was a hooligan. Wang Delu said fiercely: "I think these people who were shot were wronged. The Eighth Route Army wrongfully killed many good people. When the Kuomintang comes back one day, I will report it and arrest all these staff members, leaving none!" After hearing this, Gu Xiulan kindly explained to him the rationale for suppressing counter-revolutionaries, but Wang Delu glared at her and asked, "How many members of your family did the special agents kill?" He even punched her. Gu Xiulan believed that Wang Delu was spreading rumors to slander the government and intimidate the masses, which was a counter-revolutionary act. She immediately reported to the district representative Yang Xiyuan at the police station, and Wang Delu was arrested.

　　Sun Jinglin, a staff member of Tianjin Customs, heightened his vigilance and exposed suspicious counter-revolutionary elements. Sun Jinglin lives at No. 25 Yantai Road, Tenth District of Tianjin. A sudden, uninvited guest came to his house a few days ago. After inquiring with his wife, he learned that the visitor's surname was Wu, who had previously served in a puppet government position. After liberation, he changed his surname to Sun and was a neighbor of his wife's family. During the conversation, Wu not only inquired about the import and export situation of the customs but also asked if it was easy to go to Hong Kong. Sun Jinglin noticed that his behavior was suspicious and immediately reported to the police station. Early the next morning, the police station summoned Wu for questioning because he had not registered his household. Wu confessed that his original name was Wu Xiusheng, that he had served as a member of the Kuomintang Party Headquarters in Wanping County, Hebei Province, and had been a clerk in the Education Section and an accountant in the County Bank of the puppet county government. He had been guilty of corruption and other misdeeds. After liberation, he fled to Beijing and was placed under control after registration. Recently, Wu Xiusheng's father was detained by the government for oppressing the people in the past, so he fled to Tianjin to hide. Wu has now been sent to the Tenth Branch of the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau.

　　After Cui Xuewen, the head of the Yiguandao sect who had committed numerous evils and lived in the bird market of Tianjin, was executed this time, Cui Xuewen's family was not saddened. Her son, Cui Fulai, who is studying at Shanxi Middle School, realized under the education of the Youth League that Cui Xuewen was not only an enemy who oppressed his mother but, in terms of his counter-revolutionary crimes, was also an enemy of the masses. After Cui was arrested, Cui Fulai repeatedly explained this to his mother, and finally, his mother understood. After her husband was shot, she also persuaded the families of other executed counter-revolutionary elements. (Attached picture)

　　天津大张旗鼓镇压反革命       
    群众检举反革命分子
    【本报讯】天津市大张旗鼓地镇压反革命的结果，使人民群众政治觉悟迅速提高，并纷纷起来检举反革命分子，协助政府肃清反革命。天津市四区小郭庄妇女识字班学员谷秀兰，在天津市处决反革命罪犯的那天（三月三十一日），在新官汛大街一百一十三号韩水铺里，见到有一个人正在造谣威吓群众。那人叫王德禄，是流氓出身。王德禄气势汹汹地说：“我看枪毙的这些人，死得太屈了，八路军屈杀了很多好人，将来有一天国民党回来，我去报告，把这些工作人员全抓起来，一个也不留！”谷秀兰听到后，曾和蔼地向他解释镇压反革命的道理，但王德禄反而瞪起眼来问她：“特务杀了你家多少人？”还打了她一拳。谷秀兰认为王德禄造谣诬蔑政府、威吓群众，是一种反革命行为，当即和区代表杨西园到派出所报告，将王德禄逮捕。
    天津海关工作人员孙景霖，提高警惕，检举了形迹可疑的反革命分子。孙景霖住天津市十区烟台道二十五号，日前家中突然来一不速之客。经询问妻子后，知来人姓吴，过去曾供伪职，解放后改姓孙，是其妻娘家的邻人。在谈话中，吴除向孙景霖询问海关进出口情形外，并询问去香港是否容易。孙景霖察觉其形迹可疑，随即向派出所报告。次日清早，派出所因吴未报户口，传去问话。吴供认原名吴秀生，曾任河北省宛平县国民党党部委员，当过伪县政府教育科科员及县银行会计等，曾有贪污劣行；解放后逃至北京，登记后被管制。最近，吴秀生的父亲因过去欺压人民，而被政府拘押，他才逃来天津躲藏。现吴已被送至天津市公安十分局。
    住在天津市鸟市的作恶多端的一贯道首崔学文此次被枪毙之后，崔学文的家属并不悲哀。她的儿子崔福来，在山西中学读书，在青年团的教育下，认识到崔学文不仅是欺压母亲的仇人，就其反革命罪恶来说，更是人民大众的仇敌。崔犯被捕后，崔福来反复向母亲解说这一道理，最后母亲也想通了。她在丈夫被枪毙后还劝说其他被枪决的反革命分子的家属。（附图片）
