The Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association
    Convenes Anti-Imperialist Patriotic Accusation Meeting of Catholics
    Wu Kezhai and others use concrete facts to accuse imperialism of using Catholicism to invade our country
    The Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association convened the Tianjin Catholic Anti-Imperialist Patriotic Accusation Meeting on the 15th. More than 500 Catholics from various Catholic churches in the city attended. Many elderly Catholics nearing their seventies also participated in the meeting. At the meeting, Wu Kezhai, Liang Jundong, Tong Deyi, and thirteen others accused imperialism of using Catholicism to invade and oppress the Chinese people.
    At the beginning of the meeting, Wu Kezhai, Chairman of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association, reported on the significance of the meeting. He said: "The convening of this accusation meeting is because many Catholics have requested that the facts of being deceived, hoodwinked, and exploited by imperialism in the past be accused, so that everyone can recognize the true face of imperialism using Catholicism to carry out aggression, and then wash away the residual imperialist toxins in their minds and sever ties with imperialism."
    Nie Guoping, Shen Qingyu, and others exposed the imperialists' use of Catholicism to carry out espionage activities at the meeting. Nie Guoping first accused the international spy, Belgian priest Lei Zhenyuan, of using the name of Catholicism to organize the "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps," "People's Self-Defense Corps," and "People's National Construction Advancement Association" to carry out espionage activities and endanger the people of the motherland. He said: "The Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" was formed in 1946 by Lei Zhenyuan after being summoned by Chiang Kai-shek's secret service chief Dai Li, and with the secret service agent of the bandit gang, Catholic Diao Huaren, under orders. It was directly under the leadership of the bandit Secret Service Bureau, and all its members were Catholic priests and Catholics. "The Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" specialized in collecting intelligence about the liberated areas for the American and Chiang bandits, and carried out assassinations and "defections." Wu Yage, the priest who was the principal culprit in the "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" case cracked in Shijiazhuang, once used the church to develop special agents, directed bandit planes to bomb the liberated areas, and attempted to assassinate our people's leaders. Lei Zhenyuan also used Catholics to organize the "People's Self-Defense Corps," with three or four hundred people participating, led by priests, and all the Catholics were organized into squads, contacting Kuomintang agents, calling themselves the "August 13th" unit, attempting to sabotage the liberated areas and provide intelligence to the American and Chiang bandits. The "People's National Construction Advancement Association" organized by Lei Zhenyuan was an external organization for carrying out espionage activities. Jin Yupei, a special agent who has been arrested by the People's Government, was the captain of the "Tianjin-Beiping District Team of the Underground Work Corps of the Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" and the secretary of the "People's National Construction Advancement Association." Nie Guoping said angrily at this point in his accusation: "We Catholics really feel heartbroken that these special agents actually used divine power to say that the special agent organization was a matter within Catholicism. If we do not resolutely sever the connection between Catholicism and imperialism, we will not be able to wash away these stains on Catholicism."
    Gao Jiesan of the Tianjin Catholic special agent organization "People's National Construction Advancement Association" which had been cracked, said: "In the summer of 1947, Lei Zhenyuan instructed Jin Yupei to establish the 'People's National Construction Advancement Association' in Tianjin. Jin first went to Jin Gu University to find the principal, Father Liu Nairen (a Kuomintang special agent who had fled to Taiwan). He asked Liu Nairen to connect him to social connections and introduce Catholics from various churches. I was one of them. A week later, the association was established in Tianjin. Among the thirty or so people who attended the founding meeting were Hu Menghua, director of the Chiang bandit Social Bureau, and Bai Shiwei, director of the Inspection Office. The meeting explained that the organization would be established in various places first, and then a joint association would be established, and said that organizations had been established in Taiyuan and Beiping. At that time, a board of directors and a board of supervisors were also formed, and executive directors were elected. I was elected as chairman, and Jin Yupei was hired as secretary."
    Shen Qingyu and Cui Xiuwen, students of Jin Gu University, accused the American imperialist spies, French priests Bu Xiangxian, Bao Yihua, Fang Ruhui, etc., of using church schools to carry out espionage activities at the meeting.
    In the accusations, many Catholics pointed out that Wen Guibin, the French bishop of the Tianjin Catholic Diocese, was the chief leader of the imperialist elements in the Tianjin Catholic Church. Wen took office as the bishop of the Tianjin Diocese in 1922. After the liberation of Tianjin, Wen threatened the Catholic Tong Deyi and said: "You have to be careful, you are not allowed to sing the turning-over song." After the reform movement started, Wen tried his best to sabotage it. After some Chinese priests signed the reform declaration, Wen threatened: "If Chinese priests sign, they will not be allowed to say Mass tomorrow." But the patriotic Chinese priests were not intimidated by his abuse of divine power. Wen then wrote a letter to Li Depei, the priest of Jijiazhuang Church who had signed the declaration, threatening him: "I hope you did not sign, if you signed, I will suspend your divine power." The second time Wen wrote a letter asking Father Li to confess for three days. Wen also asked the Catholics of Jijiazhuang Church who had signed to write a confession. These despicable acts of sabotage made the broad masses of Catholics more clearly recognize Wen's imperialist face. Wen once attempted to prevent Tong Deyi, a Catholic who promoted the reform movement in Jijiazhuang Church, from going to Jijiazhuang. Tong Deyi said angrily during the accusation: "He, a Frenchman, actually dared to restrict a Chinese person's actions on Chinese soil. I don't know if he regards Jijiazhuang as French territory, or if he wants to turn Jijiazhuang into a French concession?" Tong Deyi also said: "All the Catholics in our Southwest Chengjiao Church are wondering: Why do we still allow such imperialist elements to ride on our heads? This is a disgrace to the entire Catholic Church!" When Wu Kezhai accused Wen Guibin, he listed Wen's crimes: Wen systematically handed over many churches in Tianjin to foreign priests to manage, and many Chinese priests were locked up in the Xikai General Church and not allowed to intervene. Wen Guibin allowed the international spy Lei Zhenyuan to use the name of Catholicism to organize the "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps," but did not allow the broad masses of Catholics to use the words Catholic when carrying out the anti-imperialist patriotic religious reform movement. Wen Guibin recently saw the victorious development of the Catholic reform movement and said insidiously: "Catholicism was introduced by foreigners. When we leave, we will destroy everything." Liang Jundong also accused Wen Guibin at the meeting of ordering Ning Shoudao, the Dutch priest of Sandeli Church, to tear up the announcement of the reform signature movement and insult Zhao Zhenya, the Chinese vice-bishop.
    Many Catholics also accused the imperialist elements in the Catholic Church of consistently oppressing Chinese Catholics and enslaving Chinese priests. Hou Peijin accused Lang Ruowang, an Italian priest of the Beijing Dunjiazhuang Church in the past, of his crimes. Lang Ruowang once used a leather whip to beat Catholics and drive wolves and dogs to bite people; when performing the "Four Great Zhanli," he ordered women to run races with cloth bags on their feet, and many people fell and were injured, but he laughed loudly. Liu Bociz, Wu Dongchen, and others also listed facts to accuse the imperialist elements of how arrogant and extravagant they were, bullying Chinese Catholics and priests.

　　天津市天主教革新运动促进会
    召开天主教徒反帝爱国控诉大会
    吴克斋等以具体事实控诉帝国主义利用天主教侵略我国
    天津市天主教革新运动促进会，于十五日召开天津市天主教徒反帝爱国控诉大会，到全市各天主教堂教徒五百余人。不少年近古稀的老教徒，也参加了大会。会上有吴克斋、梁俊栋、佟德义等十三人控诉帝国主义利用天主教进行侵略、欺压中国人民的罪行。
    会议开始，大会主席、天津市天主教革新运动促进会主任委员吴克斋报告开会意义。他说：“这个控诉会的召开，是因为许多教友群众要求把过去受到帝国主义的欺骗、蒙蔽以及被利用的事实控诉出来，让大家认清帝国主义利用天主教进行侵略的真面目，进而洗清思想中的帝国主义残余毒素，割断与帝国主义的联系。”
    聂国屏、申庆余等在会上揭发了帝国主义利用天主教进行间谍特务活动。聂国屏首先控诉国际间谍、比利时神甫雷震远利用天主教名义，组织“公教青年报国团”、“民众自卫团”及“民众建国协进会”，进行间谍特务活动，危害祖国人民的罪恶事实。他说：“公教青年报国团”是雷震远被蒋匪特务头子戴笠召见后，与匪保密局特务、天主教徒刁化仁等奉命于一九四六年组成的，直属匪保密局领导，内部成员全是天主教神甫及教徒。“公教青年报国团”专门为美蒋匪帮搜集解放区情报，并进行暗杀和“策反”工作。在石家庄破获的“公教青年报国团”案主犯吴雅阁神甫，就曾利用教会，发展特务，指挥匪机轰炸解放区并企图谋刺我人民领袖。雷震远又利用天主教徒组织了“民众自卫团”，有三、四百人参加，由神甫领导，把教徒都编成小队，与国民党特务联系，称为“八一三”部队，企图破坏解放区，供给美蒋情报。雷震远组织的“民众建国协进会”，则是进行特务活动的一个外围组织。已被人民政府逮捕的特务分子金玉培，就是“公教青年报国团地下工作总队平津区队”队长和“民众建国协进会”秘书。聂国屏控诉至此，激怒地说：“我们教友真是感到痛心，这些特务竟用神权，把特务组织说成是天主教内的事。如果我们不坚决割断天主教与帝国主义的联系，我们就洗不清这些加在天主教上的污点。”
    已被破获的天津天主教内特务组织“民众建国协进会”郜杰三说：“一九四七年夏，雷震远指示金玉培来天津市建立‘民众建国协进会’。金先到津沽大学找校长刘乃仁神甫（国民党特务，已逃台湾）。他叫刘乃仁替他拉社会关系，介绍各教堂教友。我就是其中之一。一星期后，该会即在天津成立，出席成立会的三十多人中，有蒋匪社会局长胡梦华和稽查处长白世维。会上说明该组织先在各地成立，以后再成立联合会，并说在太原、北平已成立了组织。当时并组成了理事会和监事会，推出常务理事，推我作理事长，并聘金玉培为秘书。”
    津沽大学学生申庆余、崔秀文在会上控诉了美帝国主义间谍、法籍神甫卜相贤、鲍翊华、房如晦等利用教会学校，进行间谍活动。
    在控诉中，不少教徒都指斥天主教天津教区法籍主教文贵宾为天津天主教内帝国主义分子的总头子，文于一九二二年即就任天津教区主教。天津解放后，文曾威胁教徒佟德义说：“你要小心，翻身歌不准唱。”在革新运动展开后，文更百般破坏。一部分中国神甫在革新宣言上签名后，文曾威胁说：“中国神甫要是签了名，明天就不准做弥撒。”但爱国的中国神甫并没有被他这种滥用神权的行为所吓倒。文当时曾写信恐吓已签名的纪家庄教堂李德培神甫说：“我希望你没有签名，如果你签了名，我就把你的神权挂起来。”第二次文又写信要李神甫坦白三天。文又要已签名的纪家庄教堂教徒写悔过书。这些卑鄙的破坏行动，使广大教徒更认清了文的帝国主义的面目。文曾企图禁止在纪家庄教堂推动革新运动的教徒佟德义到纪家庄去。佟德义在控诉时，激愤地说：“他一个法国人，居然敢来限制一个中国人在中国土地上的行动，不知道他把纪家庄看成是法国领土呢，还是想把纪家庄变成法国租界？”佟德义又说：“我们西南城角教堂所有的教友都在想：为什么到现在还让这样的帝国主义分子骑在我们头上？这是对整个天主教的耻辱！”吴克斋在控诉文贵宾时，列述文的罪行：文有计划地将天津的许多教堂交给外国神甫来掌管，不少中国神甫则被关在西开总堂里，不让过问。文贵宾允许国际间谍雷震远利用天主教名义组织“公教青年报国团”，却不允许广大教徒在进行反帝爱国的宗教革新运动时用天主教的字样。文贵宾在最近看到天主教革新运动胜利发展后，竟阴险地说：“天主教是外国人传来的，我们在走的时候，要把什么都毁灭掉。”梁俊栋也在会上控诉文贵宾曾命令三德里教堂荷兰籍神甫宁守道，撕毁革新签名运动的布告，污辱中国神甫赵振亚副主教的暴行。
    许多教徒还控诉了天主教内帝国主义分子一贯欺压中国教徒，奴役中国神甫的罪行。侯佩金控诉过去北京敦家庄教堂意大利籍神甫郎若望的罪行。郎若望曾用皮鞭抽打教徒，驱使狼狗咬人；在作“四大瞻礼”时，命令妇女双脚套上布口袋赛跑，有很多人跌倒摔伤，他却纵声大笑。刘伯慈、吴东辰等也列举事实控诉了帝国主义分子如何骄横奢侈，欺凌中国教徒和神甫。
