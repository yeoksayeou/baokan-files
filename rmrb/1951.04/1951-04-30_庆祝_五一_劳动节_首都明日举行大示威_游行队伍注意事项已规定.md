    [Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch] Tomorrow, people from all walks of life in the capital will hold a "May Day Labor Day Demonstration Parade." It is estimated that over 600,000 people will participate in the parade. Farmers in the suburbs will also hold parades and demonstrations in the four suburban areas. The marching contingents will complete assembly before 10:00 AM. In order to ensure the marching contingents quickly reach the venue, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has decided to temporarily suspend traffic in some areas.

When encountering intersections, the contingent with the earlier position in the parade sequence should be allowed to proceed first, and punctuality is required. After the marching contingents exit the West Third Gate, they should quickly disperse according to the return routes designated by the General Command.
    The marching contingents will proceed in seventy columns at the assembly venue, passing in front of the Tiananmen rostrum without stopping or performing, to ensure rapid passage. Except for cultural troupes, no one is allowed to wear costumes or carry gongs and drums.
    The Preparatory Committee of the Beijing People's Celebration of May Day Labor Day Demonstration Parade has issued the following "Important Notes for the大会 [Dàhuì, General Assembly/Mass Meeting]": 1. The participating contingents shall be organized at the designated area on time in accordance with the time stipulated by the command, and the meeting shall be held on time. 2.
