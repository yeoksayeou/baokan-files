According to the Japanese progressive newspaper *People's News* on January 29th: The Yoshida Cabinet meeting on December 28th last year decided to increase the police reserve force by 250,000 people. *Truth Special Communication* on February 28th stated: Iwane Hideo, the pro-American Japanese secret agent chief, has drafted a rearmament plan, attempting to establish land, sea, and air forces totaling 300,000 people. Furthermore, according to a report by Buckingham, the Tokyo bureau chief of the American *Newsweek*: Dulles' plan to rearm Japan is to rebuild twelve divisions of ground troops, totaling 200,000 people; and an air force of 25,000 people. The Japanese bourgeois economic magazine *Business World of Japan* revealed in its March 1st issue: "It is rumored that the 300,000 blankets scheduled for export have now been decided not to be exported, and will be entirely used for the police reserve force in the future."
