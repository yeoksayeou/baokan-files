　　Guangdong Provincial People's Government Chairman
　  Ye Jianying Issues Statement
　  Condemning the Hong Kong British Government's Unreasonable Acquittal of American-Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Who Robbed Our Fishing Boat

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th: On March 15, 1951, the Hong Kong British government acquitted American-Chiang Kai-shek bandits who robbed our fishing boats in Hong Kong. Regarding this unreasonable measure, Ye Jianying, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, issued the following statement:

    All five fishing boats belonging to our Guangdong Provincial People's Government that were staying in Hong Kong, namely Yushi, Yulian, and Yuyang, were suddenly hijacked on June 22, 1950, by over 30 American-Chiang Kai-shek bandits headed by Arno and Song Hengyu. The Hong Kong British government had previously allowed them to illegally clear customs. When the American-Chiang Kai-shek bandits were robbing the boats, a British water police vessel docked nearby even detained the reporting crew members on the charge of "reporting a false case." Furthermore, they used machine guns to prevent our crew members from resisting and escorted the bandits as they sailed the boats out to sea. After this incident occurred, the hijacked crew members immediately filed charges with the Hong Kong court. However, the Hong Kong British government created numerous difficulties and, in effect, froze the remaining Yupu and Yuqiong boats. The Hong Kong British government deliberately exonerated the American-Chiang Kai-shek bandits and attempted to collude with them to further seize the ownership of these five fishing boats. On March 15, 1951, they unreasonably acquitted the American-Chiang Kai-shek bandits who robbed the three fishing boats. As early as March 18, 1950, Minister Zhang Bojun of the Ministry of Communications of our Central People's Government had already issued a statement: "If this sacred property of our Central People's Government (referring to our government's property rights over Chinese ships in Singapore, Hong Kong, and other ports) is infringed upon, damaged, detained, transferred, or interfered with in its actions in Singapore, Hong Kong, and other ports, the respective governments must bear full responsibility and will incur corresponding consequences." I hereby solemnly declare that the Hong Kong British authorities' act of openly protecting American-Chiang Kai-shek bandits who rob our national property is illegal and unreasonable. The Hong Kong British government shall bear full responsibility for this matter and its consequences.

　　广东省人民政府主席
　  叶剑英发表声明
　  斥香港英政府无理宣判劫我渔船的美蒋匪徒无罪
    【新华社广州五日电】一九五一年三月十五日香港英政府宣判劫夺我在香港渔船的美蒋匪徒为无罪。对此种无理措施，广东省人民政府叶剑英主席特发表声明如下：
    我广东省人民政府所有留香港五艘渔船，其中渔时、渔连、渔扬三艘，于一九五○年六月二十二日突被以阿诺、宋亨豫为首的美蒋匪徒三十余人劫走。香港英政府事前既准其非法结关，而在美蒋匪徒劫夺时，在傍停泊之英水警轮又竟将报警船员以“报假案”罪加以扣押，且更以机枪制止我船员之抵抗，护送匪徒劫船出海。此事发生后，被劫船员当即向香港法院指控，而香港英政府诸多为难，并变相地将劫余之渔浦、渔琼两船加以冻结。香港英政府蓄意为美蒋匪徒洗刷罪名，并企图与他们互相勾结，进一步劫夺这五艘渔船的产权，竟于一九五一年三月十五日无理宣判劫夺三渔船之美蒋匪徒为无罪。早在一九五○年三月十八日我中央人民政府交通部章伯钧部长即已发表声明：“我中央人民政府的此项神圣的产权（按指我政府对在新加坡、香港以及各国港口的中国轮船的产权），如在新加坡、香港和各国港口的各轮有被侵犯、损坏、扣留、转移或干涉其行动情事，则各该政府必须负完全责任，并将引起相应的后果。”本人兹特郑重声明：香港英当局此种公然庇护美蒋匪徒劫夺我国家财产的行为，是非法的，无理的。香港英政府应对此事及其后果负全部责任。
