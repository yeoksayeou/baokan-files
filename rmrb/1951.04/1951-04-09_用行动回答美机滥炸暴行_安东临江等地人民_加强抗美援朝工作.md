　　Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 8th: The people of Andong, Linjiang, and other places express strong anger at the bombing and strafing atrocities of the invading American aircraft. Wang Jingbin, a female model worker at the Andong Railway Bureau Telephone Office, and Cai Zhizhong, a model worker and deputy stationmaster at the Andong Station, both angrily stated: "MacArthur's arrogant statement and the American aircraft's atrocities will absolutely not scare the heroic Chinese people. We must do a better job in resisting America and aiding Korea with greater strength, and use practical actions to strike at the American aggressors!" All employees of the Andong City Power Supply Bureau calmly worked during the American aircraft invasion, ensuring the city's normal power supply. At the same time, they each donated 20,000 Northeast currency units to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's Forces. The city's industrial and commercial sectors also donated 1.6 billion Northeast currency units to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers. More than 500 propagandists from various streets in Andong visited households for days, exposing MacArthur's shameless statement and the American aircraft's crimes of massacring our people. Under the slogan of "Those who are alive must resolutely fight the American devils to the end," workers of the Linjiang Railway's telecommunications section repaired the bombed train communication lines within forty minutes. Station employees also promptly prepared trains to ensure punctual departure. Now, people from all walks of life in Linjiang are actively establishing patriotic covenants, determined to respond to the atrocities of the American imperialists with practical actions to resist America and aid Korea.
