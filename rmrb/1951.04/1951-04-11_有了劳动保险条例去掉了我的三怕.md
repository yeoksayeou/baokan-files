The Labor Insurance Regulations Removed My Three Fears

　　I am a worker at the Taiyuan Telecommunications Bureau, and I am sixty-one years old this year. After listening to Vice Chairman Ma Zhen of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' speech on the "Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China," I felt an irrepressible surge of joy in my heart. However, I couldn't help but think of two old comrades who used to work with me: one was He Jingyuan, who worked at the Taiyuan Telegraph Bureau for more than thirty years. When the Japanese devils were around, he broke his leg while repairing a line. The doctor only gave him some ineffective medicine, and no one cared about the medical expenses. Old He managed to heal his injury with the help of his fellow workers, but he was left with a limp. After the Yan Xishan bandit gang took over Taiyuan, the bureau simply fired him. He Jingyuan, who was over sixty years old, had to beg on the streets and later disappeared. The other was Old Yao, who worked at the Telecommunications Bureau for fifty years. In 1945, after the Yan Xishan bandit gang returned to Taiyuan, he was laid off. He was already in his seventies at the time. He had no family and was destitute. He later wandered to the countryside begging for food and starved to death not long after. These two incidents have been constantly haunting me. Isn't this the tragic fate of countless working-class brothers in the old society? At that time, I had three fears in my heart: fear of unemployment, fear of starvation, and fear of dying without anyone to care for me.

　　Now, Chairman Mao has promulgated the Labor Insurance Regulations. I am truly filled with joy and feel that I have become younger. I already meet the retirement requirements, but I am unwilling to retire. I want to work hard for a few more years and pass on my skills to others. Our production team has already challenged the Ma Hengchang team, and we have already achieved significant results last month. I guarantee to help everyone improve their production skills and defend our victorious achievements with my own practical actions.

### 有了劳动保险条例去掉了我的三怕

　　有了劳动保险条例去掉了我的三怕
    我是太原电信局的工人，今年六十一岁。我听了市总工会马贞副主席关于“中华人民共和国劳动保险条例”的讲话以后，心中就有一阵阵抑制不住的痛快劲儿。可是，我不由地又想起了过去和我在一块做工的两个老伙伴：一个是贺景元，他在太原电报局干了三十几年。日本鬼子在时，他因为整修线路，摔断了腿。医生只给他涂了些不顶事的药水，医药费根本没人过问。老贺还是在工友们的帮助下，把伤治好了，但已成跛子。阎锡山匪帮接收太原后，局方索性把他开除了。六十多岁的贺景元只好沿街讨饭，后来就不知下落了。再一个是在电信局干了五十年的老姚。一九四五年阎锡山匪帮返回太原后，他被裁掉。他当时已经是七十几岁的人了。没有家眷，无依无靠，后来讨饭流落到乡村，不多时就饿死了。这两件事，过去时时刻刻在我心里幌动着。这不正是旧社会无数工人兄弟的悲惨下场吗？那时，我心中有三怕：怕失业，怕饿死，怕死了没人管。
    现在，毛主席颁布了劳动保险条例。我真是满心窝高兴，觉得自己又年青了许多。我现在已够退休条件了，但是我不愿意退休。我还要再好好工作几年，把我的技术教给别人。我们生产小组已经向马恒昌小组应战了，而且上月份已有了显著的成绩。我保证要好好地帮助大家提高生产技术，以自己的实际行动，保卫我们胜利的果实。
