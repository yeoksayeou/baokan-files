Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 10th. Following the exposure by the people of Guangzhou and Nanjing of the crimes of imperialist so-called "charitable organizations" harming Chinese children, the people of Ganzhou City, Jiangxi Province, have also recently exposed the crimes of the "Catholic Church Orphanage" in the city, run by American Catholic Bishop John A. O’Shea, for torturing and murdering Chinese children. This orphanage was founded in 1896 by a French Catholic priest. In 1919, American priest John A. O’Shea took over the orphanage after obtaining the bishopric of the Catholic Diocese of Ganzhou. The orphanage has always been indifferent to the health of children and has adopted cruel and destructive methods, resulting in the death of a large number of children. According to investigations: from 1896 to August 1949, when Ganzhou was liberated, a total of 3,342 Chinese children died in the orphanage, with a mortality rate of 84.2% of the total number of orphans admitted. After liberation, the Ganzhou Municipal People's Government repeatedly advised the orphanage to pay attention to the health of the orphans, but John A. O’Shea ignored them. In the year or so from the liberation of the city to March of this year, another 73 orphans continued to die in the orphanage. The orphanage currently has 319 orphans, and their living conditions are very poor. Among them, twenty infants aged one to three live in the nursery room filled with the stench of feces and urine and turbid air. The orphanage never pays attention to infant diseases, so that most of the infants have lung disease or skin sores; orphans over the age of three are very weak due to long-term consumption of only rice soup, pickles, and vegetable roots, and those suffering from lung disease account for 20%; orphans over the age of eight have to engage in heavy labor such as hulling rice, carrying water, weaving cloth, and growing vegetables, which seriously hinders the normal development of their bodies; the orphans in the orphanage have no personal freedom, and the marriage of adult girls or keeping them as nuns is entirely determined by John A. O’Shea.

The crimes of these American imperialist elements in torturing and murdering Chinese children have aroused strong indignation among the people of all walks of life in Ganzhou City, who have demanded that the government deal with them severely.

　　江西赣州市天主堂孤儿院长期虐杀我国儿童
　　人民要求政府严厉处理
    【新华社南昌十日电】继广州、南京两市人民揭发帝国主义的所谓“慈善机关”残害中国儿童的事件以后，江西赣州市人民也于最近揭露了该市美籍天主教主教和若望主办的“天主堂孤儿院”虐杀中国儿童的罪行。这所孤儿院是在一八九六年由一位法籍天主教神父创办的，一九一九年美籍神父和若望取得天主教赣州教区主教权后，即接办该孤儿院。该院对于儿童的健康一向漠不关心，并且采取残忍的摧残手段，造成大批儿童的死亡。据调查：自一八九六年至一九四九年八月赣州解放时止，孤儿院内共死亡中国儿童三千三百四十二名，死亡率达收容孤儿总数的百分之八十四点二。解放以后，赣州市人民政府曾几次劝说该院注意孤儿健康，但和若望却置之不理。从该市解放到本年三月止的一年多时间内，该院孤儿又继续死亡了七十三名。该院现在还有孤儿三百一十九名，他们的生活条件非常恶劣。其中有一岁到三岁的二十个婴儿住在充满屎臭尿臭、空气混浊的育婴室内。院方对婴儿疾病从不注意，以致大多数的婴孩已患肺病或染有疮疾；三岁以上的孤儿由于长期只吃米汤、腌菜、菜根，身体都很羸弱，患肺病的占百分之二十；八岁以上的孤儿就要从事砻谷、挑水、织布、种菜等繁重劳动，严重地妨碍了身体的正常发育；院内孤儿们都没有人身自由，成年女孩出嫁或留作道女，完全由和若望决定。
    美帝国主义分子这种虐杀中国儿童的罪行，已激起赣州市各界人民的强烈愤怒，纷纷要求政府严厉处理。
