Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: The British People's Delegation to China, consisting of nine members, which is here to participate in our country's May Day celebration, arrived in Beijing by plane at 1:00 PM today.

Those who went to the airport to welcome them included: Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs; Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing; Liu Guanyi, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression; Hong Shen, Director of the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations of the Government Administration Council's Cultural and Educational Committee; Qian Duansheng and Wang Tieya, professors at Peking University; Zhou Peiyuan, professor at Tsinghua University; Tu Changwang, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies; Zeng Xianzhi, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation; Meng Yongqian, Director of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives; Wu Maosun, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs; Chen Shaomin, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union; Qiu Jin, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the China Seamen's Union; An Lifu, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Dockworkers' Union; Shi Pinghao and Xia Bi Ruo, British advisors to the International News Bureau; Wei Ningdun, Beijing correspondent for the British *Daily Worker*, and dozens of others.

During the brief welcoming ceremony at the airport, the British People's Delegation received flowers from representatives of various organizations. Liu Ningyi then delivered a speech on behalf of the various people's organizations in our country, extending a warm welcome to the British People's Delegation. He pointed out that at a time when people all over the world are unanimously demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, opposing the rearmament of West Germany and Japan by the United States, and opposing the separate peace treaty with Japan by the United States, the arrival of the British People's Delegation once again proves the will of the people of all countries to unite and resolutely struggle for the cause of peace. The arrival of the British People's Delegation will greatly contribute to the development of friendship between the people of China and Britain. We believe that the people of China and Britain will unite more closely and work together to defend the common cause of world peace.

In his reply, Kane, the head of the British People's Delegation, first thanked the Chinese people for their warm welcome and invitation, and said that he felt extremely honored to be a member of the first British people's delegation to visit China. He said that the purpose of the delegation's visit to China was first to celebrate the great construction victories achieved by the Chinese people and to participate in the grand celebration of this victory. He emphasized: The task of our delegation is to promote and strengthen world peace. Our country needs peace and the friendship of China. The British people have launched a broad movement against Britain's involvement in a war against China, whether now or in the future. He pointed out: Britain's prosperity requires trade and friendship with China. He said that after the delegation returns to Britain, it will report the great achievements of the new China's construction to the British people. Kane said that no matter what obstacles there are, the friendship between the people of Britain and China will continue to flourish and grow. He finally shouted: Long live the friendship between the people of Britain and China! Long live the People's Republic of China!

At 8:00 PM in the evening, the Reception Committee for the British People's Delegation, jointly formed by the All-China Federation of Trade unions, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, the National Democratic Women's Federation, and the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations, hosted a banquet for all members of the delegation.
