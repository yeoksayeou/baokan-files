Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from People's Daily Readers

　　Northern Jiaotong University Beijing Railway Institute
    Has Noticed Students' Health Problems
Comrade Editor:
    The "Letters from Readers" column in your newspaper on March 20th published a letter from Comrade Wang Shishan (incorrectly reported as Wang Shanshi in the previous report) and others criticizing our institute's transportation, materials, and telecommunications departments for having heavy workloads, which affects students' health. We believe that most of the criticisms are consistent with the facts. We have paid attention to this issue and are striving to resolve it.
    Before liberation, our institute had a serious disconnect from practical needs. After liberation, the people's railways developed rapidly, making it even more difficult to meet the needs on the ground. Therefore, the issue of curriculum reform became urgent. Reforming the curriculum is a long-term and meticulous task, and we did not handle it carefully enough, resulting in some courses being excessively burdensome. On the other hand, higher technical education in the field of railways is still not a fully mature academic discipline at present. Although we consulted with relevant bureaus and experts of the Ministry of Railways during curriculum reform, the time was rushed, and it was inevitable that excessively burdensome phenomena would occur. However, changing transportation, materials, and telecommunications into engineering departments and enriching the curriculum to meet the needs of the people's railways is still the correct direction.
    Now, in order to solve the problem of excessively heavy workloads, we have universally established teaching research guidance groups to meticulously study course content, teaching hours, and teaching methods. On the other hand, we are conducting another detailed survey of self-study hours among students. Finally, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education, we will discuss with teachers and appropriately streamline some courses. Before this issue is resolved, we have notified all departments to appropriately reduce homework and lecture content. In terms of meals, we have also assigned dedicated personnel to manage them since February of this year, and there has been significant progress. At the same time, we are paying attention to carrying out various extracurricular cultural and recreational activities and appropriately allocating study time and cultural and recreational activity time.
    Curriculum reform is a long-term and meticulous task. In order to run the people's railway education well, we are trying our best to shorten this process and hope that comrades in relevant departments will give us guidance at any time.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　北方交通大学北京铁道学院
    已注意学员健康问题编辑同志：
    贵报三月二十日“读者来信”栏，登载了王世善（前报误为王善世）同学等批评我院运输、材料、电信三系功课繁重，影响学生健康一信。我们认为批评大部是符合事实的。我们已重视这一问题，正力求解决。
    解放前，我院有着严重的与实际需要脱节现象；解放后，人民铁道飞跃发展，更难满足现场的需要，因此课程改革问题，就迫不及待了。改革课程是一个长期的细致的工作，我们处理得不够十分慎重，因而产生了一部分课程过分繁重的现象；另一方面，关于铁路方面的高等技术教育，在现时还是不十分成熟的一门学术，在课程改革中虽曾与铁道部有关各局及专家共同研究，因为时间仓促，仍不免产生过分繁重现象。但将运输、材料、电信改为工程系，充实课程内容，以适应人民铁道的需要，这个方向还是正确的。
    现在，我们为了解决课程过分繁重问题，已普遍成立了教学研究指导组，精密研究课程内容，教学时数及教学方法；另一方面，在学生中再次详细调查自学时数，最后按照教育部之规定，与教员研究，适当精简一部分课程。在此问题解决前，已通知各系，适当减轻习题及授课内容。在伙食方面，本年二月起，也加派了专人管理，已大有进步。同时注意开展各种课外文化娱乐活动，适当地调配学习时间及文化娱乐活动时间。
    课程改革，是一个长期而细致的工作，为了办好人民铁道的教育，我们正尽量努力缩短这一过程，并希望有关部门的同志随时给我们以指教。
