Some Experiences from Visiting Land Reform
Professor of Tsinghua University Xu Yuhan

This time, I went to Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, with the Northwest China Land Reform Visiting Group from various universities in Beijing, to see some land reform work on the ground. Although it only lasted thirty-five days, the harvest during this short period was richer than any learning period of the same length. I re-entered university once. Now I will briefly write down some of the experiences I felt most closely during this trip.

(I)

First of all, based on my personal experience during this visit, I can definitely report to those who have not seen the land reform work on the ground: the land reform work is done very correctly and very well. In the past, there was a rumor in the city that the decrees and announcements regarding land reform promulgated by the Central People's Government could be said to be perfect in terms of the clauses, without any criticism, but the decrees and clauses were one thing, and the actual implementation was another. The implication was that the cadres had deviations in implementing policies and were too strict with the landlords. I began to doubt this rumor when I received a letter from my hometown (Wuxi County) at the end of last year. The letter mentioned the land reform situation in the countryside, so-and-so was identified as a local tyrant, so-and-so was detained, etc. At that time, I felt very happy after reading this letter, because the local tyrants who had been despised by everyone in the past had received their due punishment under the People's Government. However, I still had some doubts in my mind at that time: was it because my hometown was a land reform experimental zone in southern Jiangsu, and the cadres were specially selected, so there were no deviations? After visiting Chang'an County, Shaanxi, these doubts were completely dispelled. According to our understanding, Chang'an County is not an experimental county, but just an ordinary county in the Northwest. This time, we followed the land reform work team to the countryside and stayed in Dongda Village, Eleventh Township, Wuxing District, Chang'an County, for a total of twenty days. We participated in every process of the land reform movement within these twenty days, such as understanding the situation of the peasants, rectifying and expanding the farmers' association, preliminary trial of local tyrant landlords, preparing and convening rational struggle meetings, preliminary verification of land and determination of class components. In the entire process of these twenty days, we did not find anything that could not be made public, everything was done very openly and honestly; the cadres grasped the policies very steadily, and always followed and implemented the policies, and we could not see any deviations.

The cadres treated the landlords according to the policies, without any excessive strictness. To give two examples: Dongda Village has two local tyrant landlords, Zhang Zhijing and Zhang Zhiming, the former nicknamed "King of Hexi" and the latter nicknamed "Pangolin". The arrogance and cruelty of their methods can be glimpsed from these two nicknames. The two colluded with each other to carry out high-interest exploitation. A dan of rice lent out would turn into seven and a half dan after two years, and a loan of one hundred yuan would turn into three hundred yuan after one month; not only did they not pay wages to hired long-term workers, but they also found excuses to privately torture and beat them, and extort them. The two had also forced people to death, privately hid guns and other weapons, and had participated in counter-revolutionary conspiracies. At the rational struggle meeting with more than 20,000 people in the entire district, when the victims complained to their faces, the two still tried to quibble. The complainants were furious and tried to reach out to hit the two brothers several times, but they tried their best to suppress themselves, and their hands were raised but not hit. Finally, one victim couldn't bear it anymore and slapped the two in the face. I think this hit was right, and it was a good hit, but the cadres immediately dissuaded them. When the evidence of guns and grenades seized from their homes was there, and they continued to pursue the bullets and light machine guns they had hidden before, the two still denied it. At this time, the angry emotions of the masses reached the highest point, demanding that the two be shot immediately. In fact, even if the two were shot immediately at that time, it would not be wrong to them; but the cadres patiently persuaded the masses, and finally the masses agreed to hand the two over to the People's Court for handling. May I ask, can this method of handling be said to be too strict? Can it be said to be unfair? Can it be said to be indiscriminate beatings and killings?

Second example, we once visited a landlord family in Sipocun Village, Erxiang Township, Duqu District, Chang'an County, which had already undergone land reform. This family has two courtyards. After the land reform, the front courtyard is still reserved for self-use, and the back courtyard is given to farmers who lack houses. His family's floating wealth was not touched, and his bottles and jars were displayed full of eaves because the house could no longer hold them. He also received the same amount of land as the poor peasants and hired laborers. His sideline business - the flour mill - and the means of production used for the sideline business, such as houses, mills, and livestock, were completely untouched. Just imagine, treating class enemies like this, could there be anything more lenient than this? In fact, even after land reform, the life of a former landlord is still better than that of a poor peasant or hired laborer. Because the amount of land distributed to the two is almost the same, but the landlord used to have floating wealth, and generally also has some sideline businesses, or concurrently engages in industry and commerce. Under this lenient treatment, if the landlord does not painfully realize the impropriety of relying on exploitation for a living in the past and strives to start a new life, it is really too sorry for the people.

(II)

Secondly, from land reform, I realized the infinite brightness of the motherland's future. This understanding comes from two aspects: First, the cadres we came into contact with were too admirable; second, land reform uprooted the feudal roots and cut off the connection between imperialism and the countryside. After land reform is completed for a period of time, the old forces will never be able to restore and raise their heads in China.

Let's talk about the first point first. Before going to the countryside this time, we first participated in the Chang'an County Land Reform Cadre Summary Meeting and listened to six major reports made by the county committees. Each report was firm in its position, specific, rich, vivid, and delicate in content, completely in line with the spirit of Marxism-Leninism and never intentionally mentioned the name of Marxism-Leninism. If such a major report were moved to a school as a major lecture, it would definitely be very successful. This made us experience that only the theory abstracted from rich and concrete facts can be vivid and delicate and not become dogmatic. As for the school cultural level of these reporters, only one person had attended high school, and the rest only had junior high school or elementary school education. A deputy district secretary in charge of leading the land reform work in Dongda Village, Eleventh Township, Wuxing District, Chang'an County, was only twenty-five years old and had seven years of revolutionary experience. His sophistication in handling things, his thorough consideration, and his firm stance were all things that we, who teach in universities, were ashamed of. Others, such as the two comrades from the United Front Department who took care of our lives and the four security guards who protected our safety, all made us admire them very much in their usual words and deeds. These made us experience the greatness of the Party's education. Not only that, the talents of the cadres are indeed more brilliant than the other. The district-level cadres have already made us admire them, the county-level cadres are one level higher, and the provincial-level cadres are even higher, completely in line with the principle of promotion based on merit. Their spirit of enduring hardship and hard work is even more remarkable. What impressed me most was the scene when the cadres of Chang'an County finished the meeting, the working areas were assigned, and the cadres were ready to go. Each cadre carried very little luggage on their back, surrounded in one place, listening to the person in charge of the district give the last speech. The scene was just like a platoon or company in the army, after receiving a combat mission and before actual combat, listening to the platoon leader or company commander speak. After the speech, each soldier happily stepped onto his own work post. We believe that in Chinese history, there has never been a period in which so many talents have been concentrated in a county, so many hard-working servants who wholeheartedly serve the people. With such cadres to handle affairs for the country, what things cannot be handled well!

Let's talk about the second point. The land reform work truly uprooted the roots of the reactionary forces. Landlords have close relations with imperialism and feudal superstition, which is very clear in this land reform visit. Landlords pay close attention to current affairs, but their motives and feelings for paying attention to current affairs are completely based on the interests of their own class. When American imperialism launched its aggression against Korea, one landlord said, "America is back." Just imagine, the landlords call the American aggression "back," looking forward to America like looking forward to their own parents and children. With just this sentence, you can see how close the landlord class is to imperialism. The leaders of Yiguandao are mostly landlords or special agents, so this evil sect is thoroughly reactionary, deceiving the peasants and spreading rumors to confuse the public. According to the cadres of Mingdu District, Chang'an County, Yiguandao spread rumors in the countryside, saying that "the '共' character of the Communist Party can be split into '廿八', indicating that the Communist Party only has twenty-eight years of rule. Now, since the establishment of the Communist Party, it has exceeded twenty-eight years, so it is about to end." They also said, "The hat badge of the People's Liberation Army is written with '八一', indicating that after the Eighth Route Army, it is Yiguandao." We have also seen some Yiguandao "documents" confiscated in Chang'an County, which do contain suggestive counter-revolutionary words. From this, it can be seen that if the landlord class is not eliminated and the reactionary sects are not cleared, a root of the reactionary forces will remain in the countryside. Land reform is precisely to uproot the roots of the reactionary forces. If the land reform work is not purely a peaceful distribution of land, then in the process of land reform, the masses will realize that their poverty is not due to being born with bad luck, but due to being exploited, so they will no longer be superstitious. Some peasants in Chang'an have begun to not worship the kitchen god in their homes and instead hang portraits of Chairman Mao. In Yaitou Village near Dongda Village where we lived, fourteen Yiguandao members confessed and withdrew from the sect during the initial mobilization of the masses in the land reform process. After the completion of the land reform and the re-election of the village government, the political consciousness of the peasants has been raised, they understand how to defend their own regime, and the reactionary forces will definitely not be able to stand.

(III)

Finally, I will talk about the impact of visiting land reform on me personally. Within these thirty-five days, I felt that I had undergone three changes: first, I initially established a class viewpoint; second, I realized the importance of practice; and third, I began to have feelings for the peasant class.

In the countryside, there are mainly only two classes, peasants and landlords. The boundaries between the two are very clear, the camps are very obvious, and the contradictions are very sharp. After a peasant is elected as the chairman or member of the farmers' association, if he casually beats people, takes the landlord's line, drinks and eats meat at the landlord's house, and shelters the landlord to transfer property, he will definitely be spurned by the peasant masses. Jing Shengfu in Dongda Village is such an example. He was originally born as a poor peasant and hired laborer. After becoming the director of the village farmers' association, he forgot his roots and inherited the style of the previous Baojia head. He did not work for the peasants, but instead beat people casually, often ate and drank at the landlord's house, and even sheltered the landlord to transfer property, and even had suspected drug trafficking, and he himself became the village lid - the tyrant of the village. After the work team arrived, the peasants reported him, and he even threatened that after the work team left, he would make everyone who reported him fall like a watermelon. But the peasants' awareness has been raised. Under the leadership of the work team, the peasants held a village farmers' meeting to review him, first by the masses accusing him, then by himself confessing and admitting his mistakes in public, and then removing him from his position as director of the farmers' association, temporarily staying in the association to observe his behavior. This is the end of a class traitor. The cadres of the work team treated the peasants and landlords completely differently, with two different attitudes and two different methods of education. Towards the peasants, they were kind and amiable, patiently enlightening and persuading them. Even towards the dregs of the peasants, such as Jing Shengfu, they still painstakingly educated them to repent and start anew. Towards the landlord class, they were stern and dealt with them according to the law, demanding that they bow their heads to the people, and would never allow them to quibble or deny. In this place where the class division is very obvious and the class contradictions are very sharp, you can't help but often review yourself, often ask yourself, which side are you willing to stand on? Have you stood firm?

Generally speaking, intellectuals working in universities in the old society probably have two common problems. The first is to ignore practice. Taking this trip to visit land reform as an example, before starting out, I did not have any extravagant expectations for this trip. I thought that regarding land reform, it would be enough to read the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the land reform issue, and the Decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on the Division of Rural Class Components - these three documents. Seeing the land reform on the ground is just like doing one or two numerical examples after understanding a mathematical theorem, and there will be nothing new. After this field visit, I realized that the previous view was completely wrong. If you are not at the land reform site, you will not know that land reform from beginning to end is a very delicate mass movement; if you are not at the land reform site, you will not deeply appreciate why "land reform is a systematic and fierce struggle" (Liu Shaoqi: "Report on the Land Reform Issue"), "It must be carried out under leadership, with planning, in an orderly manner, in accordance with the laws and regulations promulgated by the Central People's Government and the people's governments at all levels and the policies and steps determined by them." (Ibid.) Indirect knowledge without practice is only incomplete knowledge. From now on, I want to correct the previous problem of ignoring practice. The second is the lack of feelings for the working people, probably because they have lived in the city for too long and have very little contact with the peasants, so there is no way to have a close feeling for the peasants. Although I have also said that the peasants are cute, it is actually just empty talk. After going to the countryside this time, I really know how cute the peasants are. I and another colleague lived in a peasant's house. His family has five people and only more than five mu of land. Life is very difficult and they have to rely on sideline production (going to the southern mountains to cut firewood, selling charcoal, and transporting timber) to maintain the livelihood of the family. During our stay at his home, he was very concerned about our lives. Although we brought a lot of bedding, he was afraid that we would catch cold, and he used the small amount of rice straw he had stored to burn the sleeping kang for us; they themselves did not drink water on purpose, only before and after meals, taking advantage of the convenience of cooking, they drank a mouthful of water or a bowl of rice soup, but towards us, they often asked us if we wanted to drink water, and often specially spent firewood to boil water for us; once, he even temporarily left the theater (watching a play is a big deal in the countryside, a rare entertainment opportunity), went home to boil a pot of tea for us, and then went back to watch the play. This kindness made us feel very ashamed. When we left Dongda Village, the peasants came out to see us off. They tried to dissuade us several times, but it was in vain. The peasants reluctantly said goodbye and sent us all the way out of Yaitou Village. After watching us get into the big car, the car turned and slowly went back. This really made us extremely moved and ashamed. What kind of merit and virtue do we have to receive this enthusiasm?

Why are the peasants so enthusiastic about us? We realized that our clothes, utensils, language, and appearance still have a distance from the peasants. I once asked my landlord in a casual chat: "What do you think we look like?" He smiled and did not answer several times. Later I said, "Could it be like a landlord?" He said, "That's right." Even so, the peasants are still extremely enthusiastic about us. What is the reason for this? The reason is: as my landlord said, although our appearance is like a landlord, our behavior is completely different from the landlord; because we went to the countryside with the work team, and the work team is to serve the peasants, so the peasants regard us as a family, treating us like relatives from afar. This made us intimately understand that only by incorporating ourselves into the peasant team and sincerely serving the peasants can we gain the enthusiasm of the peasants and enrich our own lives. And as long as you are willing to incorporate yourself into the peasant team, no matter what your clothes and appearance are, the peasants will definitely treat you as a family. This strengthens our determination to serve the people. How to do it? As the saying goes, a single straw can crush a camel. A single straw itself is very light, but the weight is accumulated by many straws. If you pile the straws on the camel one by one, the camel will eventually be unable to support it. I hope to play the role of a straw in the great movement of building the motherland in my own position.

　　参观土地改革的一些体验
    清华大学教授  徐毓枬
    这次随着北京各大学西北区土地改革参观团，到陕西省长安县实地看了一些土地改革工作。虽然前后只有三十五天，可是在这短短时期以内，收获之丰，是在同一长度学习时期内所从来没有过的。我重新进了一次大学。现在把我在此行中最亲切感到的一些体验，简单地写在下面。
            （一）
    首先，根据个人这次参观中所得经验，我可以肯定地向没有实地看见过土地改革工作的人们报告：土地改革工作做得很正确，非常好。过去在都市内有一种流言，说中央人民政府所颁布的关于土地改革的法令文告，就条文说，可以说是尽善尽美，毫无可以批评之处，不过法令条文是一件事，实际执行又是一件事，言外之意，是说干部执行政策有偏差，对待地主太严。我对这种流言开始怀疑，是在去年年底接到家乡（无锡县）来信的时候，信中提到乡间土地改革情形，某人定为恶霸，某人被拘禁等等。当时看了这信非常痛快，因为以往人人侧目的恶霸，现在在人民政府之下，得到了他们应得的惩罚。可是当时我心中还有一些怀疑：是否因为我乡是苏南土地改革实验区，干部特别挑选得好，所以没有偏差？到陕西长安县参观以后，这种怀疑完全打消了。据我们了解，长安县并不是实验县，只是西北区普通一县。这次我们随着土地改革工作组下乡，住在长安县五星区十一乡东大村，一共住了二十天。这二十天以内的土地改革运动之每一个过程，如了解农民情况，整顿与扩大农会，预审恶霸地主，准备与召开说理斗争大会，初步查实地亩与划定成份等工作，我们都参加了。在这二十天全部过程之中，我们丝毫没有发现有什么不可告人之处，一切做得非常光明磊落；干部对政策掌握得很稳，始终遵循和贯彻着政策，看不出有什么偏差。
    干部对待地主，也是依照政策办事，毫无过严之处。举两个例：东大村有恶霸地主张志敬、张志明兄弟二人，前者绰号“河西王”后者绰号“穿山甲”，其气焰之盛，手段之狠，从这两个绰号中便可窥见一般。二人狼狈为奸，实行高利盘剥，一担米放款经二年以后本利变为七担半，一百元借款经一个月后本利变为三百元；雇佣长工不仅不付工资，还找出借口把长工私刑吊打，向长工们勒索。二人又曾逼死过人命，私藏有枪枝与其他武器，还曾参预反革命阴谋。在全区二万人以上的说理斗争大会上，受害群众当面吐苦水时，二人还图狡辩。诉苦人怒不可遏，几次三番想伸手打他们兄弟二人，可是还竭力压制着自己，手举而未打。最后有一个受害农民实在忍不住了，伸手打了二人一个耳光。我觉得这一下打得对，打得好，可是干部立即劝阻。当在他们家中起出的枪枝与手榴弹物证俱在，继续追询二人前藏之子弹与轻机枪时，二人还抵赖不承认。这时群众的愤怒情绪达到了最高点，要求把二人立即枪毙。其实即使在当时把二人立即枪毙了，也并不冤枉他们；可是干部们还是耐心地说服群众，最后群众同意把二人交给人民法庭处理。试问这种处理方法，可以说是太严吗？可以说是不公正吗？可以说是乱打乱杀吗？
    第二例，我们曾经访问过已经进行了土地改革的长安县杜曲区二乡寺坡村一个地主家庭。这家有两进房子，经过土地改革后，前进仍保留自用，后进给缺屋无屋农民。他家的浮财没有动，他的瓶罐瓮坛，因为屋内已经放不下，陈列满了一屋檐。他还分得与贫雇农所得数量相同的一份土地。他的副业——粉房——和副业所用的生产资料，如房屋、磨子、牲口等，都完全不动。试想，像这样对待阶级敌人，还有比此更宽大的吗？事实上，即使在土地改革以后，一个原先地主之生活还是比贫雇农好。因为二者所分得的土地数量差不多，但是地主以往有浮财，一般还有一些副业，或兼营工商业。如果在这种宽大待遇之下，地主还不痛悟以往靠剥削为生之不当，努力从新做人，实在太对不起人民了。
            （二）
    其次，从土地改革中，我认识了祖国前途之无限光明。这种认识是从两方面得来的：第一、我们所接触到的干部太可令人敬爱了；第二，土地改革挖去了封建之根，切断了帝国主义与农村之联系，土地改革完成经过一段时期以后，旧势力再也不会在中国复辟抬头了。
    先说第一点。这次我们在下乡之前，先在长安县参加了该县土地改革干部总结会议，听过县委们所作六次大报告，每个报告都是立场坚定，内容具体、丰富、生动、细腻，完全合乎马克思列宁主义精神而从来未曾故意提马克思列宁的名字。如果把这种大报告搬到学校作为大课演讲，一定非常成功。这使我们体验到，只有从丰富的具体事实抽象出来的理论，才会生动和细腻，不沦为教条。至于这些报告人之学校文化程度，则只有一人上过高中，其余都只有初中或小学程度。负责领导长安县五星区十一乡土地改革工作的一位副区书，年仅二十五，已有七年革命经验，其办理事情之老练，思虑之周密，立场之坚定，我们这批在大学中教书的都自愧勿如。其他如照扶我们生活的两位统战部同志，保护我们安全的四位保安员，其平常言行，都使我们非常佩服。这些使我们体验到党的教育之伟大。不仅如此，干部们的才略确是一层比一层高明。区级干部已使我们钦佩不已，县级干部又高一层，省级干部更高一层，完全合乎依成绩升迁的这个原则。他们的吃苦耐劳精神更是了不起。最使我印象深刻的，是长安县干部会议结束、工作地区派定以后，各干部整装待发时情形。每个干部背上背着很少一些行李，围在一处，听本区负责人作最后一次讲话。其情其景，恰如军队中的一排一连，在接到战斗任务以后，实际作战以前，听排长或连长讲话一样。讲话完毕以后，每个战士都愉快地大踏步走上自己的工作岗位。我们相信，中国历史上从来没有一个时期，在一个县份内，集中着这么多人才，这么多吃苦耐劳一心一意为人民服务的勤务员。以这种干部来替国家办事，那会有办不通办不好的事情！
    再谈第二点。土地改革工作真正挖去了反动势力之根。地主们和帝国主义与封建迷信有密切关系，在这次土地改革参观中看得异常清楚。地主们很留心时事，可是他们留心时事之动机与心情，却完全从他们本阶级利益出发。美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜之时，有一个地主说，“美国回来了”。试想，地主们称美国侵略为“回来”，盼望美国像盼望自己的父母子女，单凭这句话，就可以看出地主阶级和帝国主义如何亲切。一贯道的头目大多是地主或特务，因此这个邪道是彻底反动的，欺骗农民，造谣惑众。据长安县鸣犊区干部反映，一贯道在乡间散布妖言，说什么“共产党的共字可以拆为廿八，表示共产党只有二十八年天下。现在，从共产党成立，已超过二十八年了，所以就要完了。”又说什么“解放军帽徽上写着八一，表示八路军之后，就是一贯道”。我们还看见过长安县缴获的一些一贯道“文件”，里面确有隐射的反革命词句。由此可见，如果地主阶级不消灭，反动道门不肃清，反动势力在农村中就留着一枝根。土地改革正是挖去了反动势力之根。如果土地改革工作不是单纯的和平分地，则在土地改革过程中，群众自会觉悟到自己之所以贫困，并不是由于生来命苦，而是由于受人剥削，所以不再迷信。长安有些农民家里已经开始不供灶王爷，改挂毛主席像。我们所住的东大村附近的崖头村，在土地改革初步发动群众过程之中，就有十四个一贯道分子自首退道。土地改革完成，村政权改选以后，农民政治觉悟提高了，懂得保卫自己的政权，反动势力决站不住脚。
            （三）
    最后，我谈一谈参观土地改革对于我个人的影响。在这三十五天之内，我自己觉得我自己起了三种变化，第一、初步建立了阶级观点，第二、意识到实践之重要，第三、开始对农民阶级有了感情。
    农村中主要只有两个阶级，农民和地主。二者间界线很清楚，阵营很明显，矛盾很尖锐。一个农民当选为农会主任或农会委员之后，如果随便打人，走地主路线，在地主家喝酒吃肉，包庇地主转移财物，他一定被农民群众所唾弃。东大村的靖生富便是这样一个例子。他本来是贫雇农出身，当了村农会主任以后，便忘了本，继承了以往保甲长作风，不替农民办事，反而随便打人，常常在地主家吃喝。甚而包庇地主转移财物，还有包庇贩毒嫌疑，他自己变成了村盖子——一村之霸。工作组到达以后，农民检举他，他还扬言等工作组走了以后，要检举他的人个个西瓜落地。但是农民觉悟程度提高了，在工作组领导之下，农民开了个村农民大会检讨他，先由群众控诉他，再由他自己当众坦白认错，然后革去他农会主任之职，暂时留会察看。这便是背叛阶级分子之下场。工作组干部对待农民和地主，完全是两种态度，两种教育方式。对待农民是和颜悦色、循循善诱地启发和说服，即使对待农民中的败类如靖生富之流，还是苦口婆心地教育，使他悔过自新，带罪图功。对待地主阶级乃是声色俱厉，依法处理，要他向人民低头，决不让他狡辩抵赖。在这种阶级分野非常明显，阶级矛盾非常尖锐之处，你不禁会常常检讨自己，常常自问，你愿意站在那一边？站稳了没有？
    一般说来，旧社会内在大学中工作的知识分子大概有两种通病。第一是忽视实践。以此行参观土地改革为例，在出发以前，我对此行并不存什么奢望，我以为关于土地改革，只要看看中华人民共和国土地改革法、刘少奇副主席关于土地改革问题的报告，以及中央人民政府政务院关于划分农村阶级成份的决定——这三个文件就够了，实地看土地改革，只好像是在懂了一条数学定理以后，再做一两个数字实例而已，不会有什么新奇处。这次实地参观以后，才知道以前看法完全错误。不在土地改革现场，不会知道土地改革自始至终是一系统非常细腻的群众运动；不在土地改革现场，不会深刻体会到，为什么“土地改革是一场系统的激烈的斗争”（刘少奇：《关于土地改革问题的报告》），“必须完全依照中央人民政府和各级人民政府所颁布的法令及其所决定的方针、政策和步骤，有领导地、有计划地、有秩序地去进行”。（同上文）间接知识而缺乏实践，只是不完全的知识。自今而后，我要矫正以往忽视实践之病。第二是缺乏对劳动人民的感情，大概由于住在城里太久了，极少和农民接触，所以无从对农民发生亲切之感。口中虽然亦曾说过农民可爱，其实是一句空话。这次下乡以后，才真知道农民之可爱。我和另一位同仁住在一个农民家里，他家有五口人，只有五亩多地，生活非常艰难，要靠副业生产（进南山砍柴，贩炭，运木材），才能维持一家生计。我们住在他家期间，他非常关心我们的生活。虽然我们被褥带得不少，可是他怕我们着冷，用他存量不多的稻草，替我们烧睡炕；他们自己是不特意喝水的，只在饭前饭后，乘烧饭之便，喝一口水或一碗米汤，可是对待我们，却常常问我们要不要喝水，常常为我们特意费柴煮水；有一次他甚至暂时离开了戏场（看戏在乡下是一件大事，稀有的娱乐机会），回家替我们煮了一壶茶，再回去看戏。这种盛情，使我们领受了非常自愧。当我们离开东大村的时候，农民们出来欢送我们，几次劝阻，还是无效，农民们依依惜别，一直把我们送出了崖头村，看我们坐上了大车，车子转动以后，才慢慢回去。这真使我们感动极了，惭愧极了，我们何功何德，可以领受他们这份热情？
    为什么农民对我们如此热情呢？我们意识到，我们的衣着、用具、语言和外表，和农民还有一个距离。我曾在闲唠之中，问过我的房东：“你看我们像个啥样？”，问了几遍他都笑了不答，后来我说“可像个地主？”他说“对了。”虽然如此，农民对我们还是异常热情，这是什么原因呢？原因是：正如我的房东所说，我们的外表虽然像个地主，可是行为和地主完全不一样；因为我们是随着工作组下乡的，工作组是为农民服务的，所以农民把我们看作是一家人，像对待远道来的亲戚那样对待我们。这使我们亲切领会，只有把自己编入农民队伍，真心替农民服务，才会获得农民的热情，才会使自己的生活充裕起来。而且只要你自己肯把自己编入农民队伍，不论你的衣着外表如何，农民一定把你当作一家人看待。这点加强了我们为人民服务的决心。如何做法呢？俗话说得好，一根稻草压死一只骆驼，一根稻草本身是非常轻微的，可是重量乃是许多稻草累积起来的，如果把稻草一根一根地向骆驼身上堆，最后骆驼总有支持不住的时候。我希望在伟大的建设祖国运动中，在自己的岗位上，尽一根稻草的作用。
