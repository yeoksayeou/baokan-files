  All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and the Association for Science and Technology Popularization Call on Scientific Workers
        to Further Develop the Patriotism Movement
    The All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and the All-China Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology recently jointly passed a resolution to respond to the notice of the China People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Association, calling on scientific workers across the country to further develop the great patriotic movement of resisting America and aiding Korea. The resolution stated in brief: Our ranks of scientific workers should, according to this resolution, further participate in the great patriotic movement of resisting America and aiding Korea. We hope that local branches and sub-branches will convene meetings of local scientific workers to denounce the crimes of aggression and destruction committed by American and Japanese imperialism against our country's scientific and technological undertakings in the past, and to denounce the crimes of the American and Japanese running-dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents in stifling science and persecuting scientific workers. Signatures should be collected in support of the conclusion of a peace pact, and the movement to sign patriotic covenants should be promoted, further promoting patriotic enthusiasm, and striving to study hard and do a good job in one's own post. The decision also pointed out that local branches and sub-branches can formulate plans to popularize and deepen the anti-American and aid-Korea movement within this year, based on the specific conditions of the locality, immediately start implementing them, and promptly inform the general association of the progress of the work.
