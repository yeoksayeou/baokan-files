I Accuse the Christian Scoundrel Chen Wenyuan

Jiang Changchuan, Bishop of the North China District of the Chinese Methodist Church

Today, with immense anger and shame, I accuse Chen Wenyuan, a Christian scoundrel who has been hiding within the Methodist Church, willingly exploited by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang as a special agent, and engaging in anti-people and counter-revolutionary activities. I must also examine myself for insufficient political awareness and vigilance, failing to proactively prevent the anti-people work done by the scoundrels among us, and failing to conduct a thorough review in a timely manner after this criminal who harmed the people was arrested. I want to apologize to all Methodist believers, all Christian believers in China, and all the people of China.

Chen Wenyuan's crimes of colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are numerous. I will now only cite a few of the more significant ones.

First, since 1938, he has been in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's Three People's Principles Youth League, participating in the training of the League's cadres at Luojia Mountain in Wuhan, acting as an instructor and instilling reactionary ideas into others. Later, he also served as a member of the League's review board and other positions. Because of this relationship, he became even more closely associated with the Kuomintang reactionaries.

Second, the New Life Movement, led by war criminal Soong Mei-ling and Huang Renlin, also used Christian scoundrels as their tools. The organization they formed was also a peripheral organization of the Kuomintang reactionaries, hypocritically promoting "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" on the one hand, and instilling the poisonous ideas of pro-Americanism, worship of America, and fear of America on the other. Chen Wenyuan served as a director in that organization for many years.

Third, Chen Wenyuan also colluded with American imperialism to carry out various reactionary activities. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he successively obeyed the orders of the puppet Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department. From 1943 to 1944, he went to England to conduct propaganda, and in 1946 and 1948, he went to the United States to conduct propaganda for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and further proclaimed himself an unofficial ambassador of Chiang's bandits, everywhere requesting "American aid" from American imperialism to act as an accomplice in massacring the Chinese people!

The facts of these reactionary actions are sufficient to prove how Chen Wenyuan put on the cloak of religion, colluded with the Chiang bandit gang and American imperialism to jointly undermine the Chinese people's revolution, and endanger the Chinese people. We must expose his crimes and accuse him of being a sinner of the church and a sinner of the people.

After liberation, Chen Wenyuan continued to sabotage the patriotic reform work of the church, obstructing the active participation of Methodist church members in the patriotic reform work. Even more abominably, an American imperialist military transceiver was found in his home in Chongqing, and this matter was only exposed by patriotic believers of the Chongqing Methodist Church in February of this year. Chen Wenyuan arrived in Shanghai in July 1950, but he did not confess the various evils he had committed in the past, pretending to be quiet in an attempt to conceal them.

As a person in charge of the Methodist Church, I should conduct a thorough review and be punished for my negligence and irresponsibility in this matter. I want to thank the government for arresting him, and at the same time, I request the government to severely punish him according to the law. At the same time, we must conduct a profound self-criticism and call on all Methodist church members to jointly eliminate the scoundrels in the church. I am determined to rectify our church with the spirit of placing righteousness above family loyalty. For such elements as Chen Wenyuan, we must eliminate one if there is one, and ten if there are ten. We must thoroughly cleanse them! (Loud applause) So that the Methodist Church can truly become a clean and upright Methodist Church of the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the government, we will unite closely, work together with one heart, actively participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and all anti-imperialist patriotic movements, and build a new church of the new China.

　　我控诉基督教败类陈文渊
    中华卫理公会华北区会督　江长川
    今天我以无比愤怒和惭愧的情绪，来控诉潜藏在卫理公会里面、甘心为美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮特务所利用、作反人民反革命活动的基督教败类陈文渊。我也要检讨我自己，政治觉悟不够，警惕性不高，既不能主动地防止我们当中的败类所做的反人民的工作，又不能在这危害人民的罪犯逮捕之后，及时作深刻的检讨。我要向卫理公会全体信徒、全中国的基督教信徒和全中国人民谢罪。
    陈文渊与蒋介石匪帮勾结的罪行，是很多的，我现在只举出其中比较重大的几件。
    第一，他从一九三八年以来就跟蒋介石匪帮的三民主义青年团勾结起来，参加了武汉珞珈山训练杀人的三青团干部的工作，担任训导长，向别人灌输反动的思想。以后他还当了三青团的评议员等职务。他就因了这样关系，与国民党反动派来往得更密切了。
    第二，战犯宋美龄和黄仁霖所主持的新生活运动，也利用了基督教的败类做他们的工具。他们组成的那个组织也是国民党反动派的外围组织，一方面虚伪地提倡“礼义廉耻”，另一方面灌输亲美、崇美、恐美的思想毒素。陈文渊在那个组织里面，担当多年理事职务。
    第三，陈文渊又勾结了美帝国主义作种种反动活动。抗日战争期间和抗日战争胜利之后，他先后奉了伪国民党中央宣传部之命，于一九四三年至一九四四年到英国去宣传，一九四六年和一九四八年又到美国替蒋介石匪帮宣传，并且进一步自称为非正式的蒋匪大使，到处向美帝国主义请求“美援”，来做残杀中国人民的帮凶！
    以上这些反动行为的事实，足以证明陈文渊是如何披上宗教的外衣，与蒋匪帮及美帝国主义来共同破坏中国人民革命，危害中国人民的罪行。我们要把他的罪行揭发出来，控诉他是教会的罪人，人民的罪人。
    陈文渊在解放以后，对教会爱国革新工作仍然进行破坏，阻挠了卫理公会教友对于爱国革新工作的积极参加；更可恶的，是还在他重庆的家里发现了美帝国主义的军用收发报机，直到今年二月间，这件事才由重庆卫理公会爱国信徒检举出来。陈文渊于一九五○年七月就到了上海，但他并未坦白过去所做种种罪恶，假装安静，企图隐瞒。
    我是卫理公会一个负责人，对于这个事件的疏忽与不负责，应该作深刻的检讨，并受到处分。我要感谢政府已经把他逮捕，同时还要请求政府将他依法严办。同时，我们要作个深刻的自我批评，并且号召卫理公会一切教友共同来肃清会里的败类。我决定以大义灭亲的精神来整顿我们的教会，对于陈文渊这样的分子，有一个除一个，有十个除十个，一定要彻底加以清洗！（大鼓掌）使卫理公会真正成为中国人民清清白白的一个卫理公会，在政府领导之下，紧密地团结在一起，同心协力，积极参加抗美援朝和一切的反帝爱国运动，建立新中国的新教会。
