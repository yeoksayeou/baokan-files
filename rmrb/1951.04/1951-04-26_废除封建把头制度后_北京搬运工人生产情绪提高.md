　　Following the abolition of the feudal foreman system,
　  Beijing搬运 Workers’ Production Enthusiasm Increases

　　After Beijing搬运 workers overthrew the feudal foremen who had been oppressing them, they changed their old work attitude. In March 1950, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued a decision to abolish the feudal monopoly system in the搬运 industry and establish搬运 companies. Under the leadership of the government and the trade union, the 6,500搬运 workers in Beijing carried out a vigorous struggle against the foremen for three to four months, arresting and bringing to justice according to the law the most heinous and universally hated feudal foremen (commonly known in Beijing as "lou bao"), such as Li Ming, Han Xiaokai, Jin Wenquan, and Liu Deren. With the feudal forces crushed and the feudal monopoly system abolished, workers' lives were guaranteed. As a result, workers' political awareness was generally raised, their work attitude changed, and their enthusiasm for production increased. For example, when loading and unloading grain in warehouses, in the past, about two to three hundred catties of soiled grain would be produced when emptying a grain stack (30 tons); now, only two to three catties of soiled grain are produced when emptying a grain stack. In the past, warehouse workers deliberately broke the burlap sacks in order to steal grain; now, the workers are afraid of breaking the burlap sacks and losing grain. Not only do they not use hooks, but they also carry needles and thread to repair leaks at any time. 搬运 worker Xu Zhenhui, who was skilled in stacking, never taught anyone in the past. After the anti-feudal struggle and the abolition of feudal exploitation, his awareness was raised. Not only did he teach many apprentices, but he also created the "eight-corner stacking method." In this way, not only does the grain stack not leak rain, but it is also well ventilated, and each stack of grain can save thirty to forty reed mats. Previously, it took fifteen people four to five hours to weigh and stack thirty tons of grain; now, it only takes two and a half hours, and work efficiency has doubled. After the abolition of the feudal monopoly system and the elimination of intermediate exploitation, the theft of goods was eliminated because workers' lives were guaranteed. Merchants reported: "In the past, one person was required to guard each vehicle to prevent theft, but now hundreds of tons of goods can be entrusted to搬运 workers without error."

　　After the Ma Hengchang team issued a challenge to workers across the country, 48 teams of Beijing搬运 workers have responded. Currently, the city's搬运 workers are striving to ensure fast loading, unloading, safe and rapid transportation, and to complete搬运 tasks.

　　废除封建把头制度后
　  北京搬运工人生产情绪提高
    北京市搬运工人在斗掉了压在他们头上的封建把头后，改变了旧的劳动态度。一九五○年三月，中央人民政府政务院颁布了废除搬运事业中封建把持制度建立搬运公司的决定。北京市六千五百名搬运工人在政府、工会的领导下，进行了三、四个月轰轰烈烈的反把头斗争，将罪大恶极，人人痛恨的封建把头（北京俗称搂包）李明、韩消凯、金文泉、刘德仁等，由人民政府逮捕法办。摧毁了封建势力，废除了封建把持制度，工人生活得到了保障，因此工人政治觉悟普遍提高，改变了劳动态度，提高了生产积极性。如仓库装卸粮食时，过去倒一个粮囤（三十吨），总有二、三百斤土粮；现在倒一个粮囤只出二、三斤土粮。仓库工人过去为了偷粮食，故意把麻袋弄破；现在工友们唯恐弄破麻袋损失粮食，不但不用手钩，并且身上带着针线，随时缝补漏洞。搬运工人徐珍会苫垛技术，过去他向来不教给人。经过反封建斗争，废除封建剥削后，觉悟提高，他不但教了好多徒弟，还创造了“八角苫垛法”。这样，不但粮囤不漏雨，还好通风，每囤粮食还可节省苇席三十到四十领。以前三十吨粮食十五个人检斤（过磅）、码垛，需四小时至五小时才能完成；现在只需要二小时半即可完成，工作效率提高一倍。废除封建把持制度，取消中间剥削后，由于工人生活得到了保障，因而消灭了偷窃货物的情况，客商反映：“从前运货，一个车上押着一个人都看不住，现在几百吨货物交给搬运工人都没错。”
    马恒昌小组向全国工人提出挑战后，北京市搬运工人已有四十八个小组应战。目前全市搬运工人正为保证快装、快卸、运输安全迅速，完成搬运任务而奋斗。
