One of China's Most Brilliant Artistic Heritages
Dunhuang Cultural Relics Exhibition Held in Beijing

One of China's most brilliant artistic heritages of the past thousand years, the Dunhuang cultural relics, has been exhibited at the Beijing History Museum since the 13th.

The exhibition mainly consists of copies of murals from the Mogao Grottoes (commonly known as the Dunhuang Thousand Buddha Caves), including more than 900 copies of murals from the Northern Wei, Western Wei, Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties, Song, and Yuan dynasties over a thousand years. In addition, there are some copies of murals from the Han tombs in Liaoyang, copies of painted tomb bricks from the Six Dynasties, scriptures from the Six Dynasties, cave models, and statues. Photos and materials of cultural relics stolen by imperialists are also on display.

The mural copies on display include Buddha statues, Buddha stories, sutra transformation stories, and various caissons, lintels, borders, auras, lotus pedestals, and other patterns, as well as dozens of types of landscapes, portraits, boats, vehicles, and animals. The creators of these murals were all nameless "painters" or "craftsmen" over the past thousand years. They inherited the Chinese ancient realist tradition of focusing on painting portraits and depicting social life, blending the influence of Buddhism with the lives of the people, and truthfully depicting the social life (including clothing systems, production activities) and figures of various dynasties. The works are full of healthy and simple styles, fully demonstrating the magnificent spirit of Chinese art.

The Mogao Grottoes are located forty miles southeast of Dunhuang County, Gansu Province. From the Northern Wei to the Ming Dynasty, countless Buddhist caves were excavated one after another. Art workers of various dynasties created exquisite statues and murals according to the different styles of each dynasty. The murals are especially a "national treasure." There are currently 469 caves in the Mogao Grottoes. If the murals in the caves are connected, they would stretch for twenty-five kilometers. It is China's most important existing picture treasury and the world's largest existing art museum.

Since the discovery of the Dunhuang art treasure in 1900, it has been coveted by imperialist elements. Stein from Britain, Bo Xihe from France, and American spy Warner came one after another. They bribed the Taoist priest guarding the cave and carried away newly discovered ancient manuscripts, ancient paintings, silk embroidery, etc., which had great historical and artistic value. The American spy Warner also used tape to peel off large murals. These robberies have caused great losses to our national culture.

This exhibition is hosted by the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Central Ministry of Culture. The works are entirely supplied by the Dunhuang Research Institute for Cultural Relics. Chang Shuhong, director of the Dunhuang Research Institute for Cultural Relics, has been engaged in the research, tracing, and preservation of Dunhuang cultural relics since 1943.

### 我国最光辉艺术遗产之一  敦煌文物在京举行展览

　　我国最光辉艺术遗产之一
    敦煌文物在京举行展览
    中国千余年来最光辉的艺术遗产之一的敦煌文物于十三日起在北京历史博物馆举行展览。
    展览内容以莫高窟（俗称敦煌千佛洞）的壁画摹本为主，包括有北魏、西魏、隋、唐、五代、宋、元一千年间各朝代壁画摹本九百余件，此外还有一部分辽阳汉墓壁画摹本，六朝彩画墓砖摹本，六朝的写经和洞窟模型、塑像等，同时还陈列有被帝国主义盗窃的文物照片、材料等。
    展览的壁画摹本有佛像、佛传、经变故事，有各种藻井、龛楣、边饰、项光、莲座等图案，有山水、人像、舟车、动物等数十种。这些壁画的创作者，都是一千年来默默无名的“画工”或“画匠”。他们继承了中国古代以画人像与描绘社会生活为主的现实主义传统，把佛教的影响和人民的生活揉在一起，真实地表现了历代的社会生活（包括衣冠制度、生产活动）与人物。作品中充满了健康与淳朴的作风，充分表现了中国艺术的雄伟的气魄。
    莫高窟在甘肃敦煌县东南四十里，从北魏到明，前后开凿了无数佛窟，各个朝代的艺术工作者都根据各朝代不同的风格制作了一些精美的塑像和壁画。而壁画一项更是“国之瑰宝”。莫高窟现有四百六十九个洞窟，如果把洞窟的壁画连接起来长达二十五公里。它是我国最重要的现存的图画宝库，是世界上现存的最大的美术馆。
    自一九零零年敦煌艺术宝库被发现后，它即为帝国主义分子所觊觎。英国的史坦因、法国的伯希和与美国间谍华尔纳，相继而来。他们贿赂了看守洞窟的道士，把新发现的具有极大历史价值与艺术价值的古写本、古画、丝绣品等，捆载而去。美国间谍华尔纳并用胶布把大幅壁画粘走。这些劫掠造成了我们民族文化的莫大损失。
    这次展览是由中央文化部文物局主持的。作品完全由敦煌文物研究所供给。敦煌文物研究所所长常书鸿自一九四三年起即从事敦煌文物的研究、描摹和保管工作。
