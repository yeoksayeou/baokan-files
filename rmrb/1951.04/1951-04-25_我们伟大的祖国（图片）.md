    Our Great Motherland
    The bronze clepsydra is an ancient Chinese instrument for measuring time. This instrument is currently located in the Guangzhou People's Museum. It was cast in the third year of the Yuan Dynasty's Yanyou era and is more than 630 years old. The top three levels have three bronze pots, large, medium and small, with dragon heads that leak water. The pot at the bottom does not leak. A copper ruler is placed vertically, marked with the twelve divisions of the day; there is also a light wooden floating arrow, which slowly rises along the copper ruler as the water rises. People can tell the time by looking at where the arrow points.

    我们伟大的祖国
    铜壶滴漏，是我国古代计算时刻的仪器。这副仪器现存于广州人民博物馆，它是元朝延祐三年铸造的，至今六百三十多年了。上面三级放着大中小三个铜壶，有龙头漏水。下面一个铜壶不漏水，竖着一把铜尺，刻着十二个时辰；另有一枝轻木的浮箭，随着水涨沿着铜尺慢慢浮起。人们看箭头所指的地方，就知道是什么时刻。
