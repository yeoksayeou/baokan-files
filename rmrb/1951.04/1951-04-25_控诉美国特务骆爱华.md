Accusation Against American Special Agent Lockwood
    Hu Yiyun, General Secretary of the Guangdong Christian Association

    In my capacity as a director of the Guangzhou YMCA, I accuse Lockwood, the former American secretary of the YMCA and an element of American imperialism. His English name is E.H. Lockwood.

    The North American Association sends American secretaries to various YMCA branches through the National YMCA of China. They are all experts in promoting anti-communism and anti-Sovietism, spreading pro-American, worship-America, and fear-America ideologies. Many of them are also engaged in activities against the interests of the people. After liberation, these American secretaries successively withdrew from China and stayed in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia to carry out activities. For example, H.A. Brunger of Guangzhou is at the Hong Kong YMCA, and K. Stange of Changsha is in Bangkok. Their attempts are obvious.

    Lockwood is one of many American secretaries. He held many positions, serving as the general secretary, director, and committee member of the YMCA, churches, schools, hospitals, and relief agencies. Over the past thirty years, especially from after the War of Resistance Against Japan to the early days of Guangzhou's liberation, he colluded with American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to carry out reactionary conspiracy activities, fully exposing the true face of an imperialist element. His Chinese name is Lockwood, but in reality, he is "Lock-harm-China." (laughter)

    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he organized the "International Affairs Research Society" in the YMCA, colluding with reactionary heads of the Kuomintang to carry out reactionary propaganda, paralyzing and poisoning the youth. Before liberation, he hosted "International Situation Lectures," promoting the power of the atomic bomb, claiming that the United States was a true democracy, slandering the Soviet Union as a "totalitarian" country, and constantly instilling in churchgoers the idea that Christianity and communism were opposed. He also claimed that China had no talent and no hope, undermining our national self-esteem and self-confidence.

    His relationship with the U.S. imperialist spy agency—the United States Information Service—was very close. Through him, the YMCA became the agent of the USIS for distributing reactionary books and periodicals: frequently distributing pamphlets, books, and magazines to schools and hospitals throughout South China, and screening poisonous films, and holding various lectures promoting pro-American and anti-Soviet views. After liberation, more than a thousand books and periodicals were displayed at the YMCA, requiring us to regularly report to the Hong Kong USIS about the readers' situation and reactions. If we did so, Austin's lies would have one more important piece of material.

    He had extremely close relations with the American Consulate. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was in fact the consul in Qujiang, Guangdong. After liberation, he was the chairman of the American Residents Association, actually performing the duties of the American consul.

    He had close relations with the Kuomintang reactionaries, especially the war criminal T.V. Soong. He not only invited those people to the YMCA to promote anti-Soviet and anti-communist views, but also frequently associated with war criminals such as T.V. Soong, Zhang Fakui, Li Zongren, and Yu Hanmou. He could walk into the offices or homes of these reactionary leaders at any time. He praised T.V. Soong for being talented, promising, and a "figure." In 1947, Chiang Kai-shek's "important figures" Ouyang Qu, Li Dachao, Gao Xin, and others came forward to host a celebration for his sixtieth birthday.

    Lockwood was responsible for the work of many relief agencies. How did he do his relief work? During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he presided over the "International Relief Committee" in Qujiang, supporting the American special agent Adams in investigating the terrain, harbors, transportation, and production conditions in various places through this organization. Only three people had the power to make decisions on the economic payments of the Economic Cooperation Administration in China, and Lockwood was one of them. They were directly in contact with Washington, undoubtedly agents of the US State Department.

    After liberation, it was discovered from the telegrams he sent that he was also the head of the reactionary news agency—Associated Press. On the first morning after liberation, he sent a telegram to the United States.

    Through these facts, it can be clearly seen how U.S. imperialism systematically used the church, cultivated American imperialist elements in the church, and carried out reactionary activities.

    In addition, I would also like to expose the situation of U.S. imperialism using Hong Kong to carry out aggression and sabotage against the Three-Self Patriotic Movement through the church.

    Hong Kong is a garbage dump of politics and also a garbage dump of religion. Many Christian scum have also run to Hong Kong one after another, carrying out activities that endanger the interests of the Chinese people. Many Western missionary societies in China are still staying in Hong Kong, setting up offices, and continuing their conspiracy activities, such as the Presbyterian Church, Baptist Church, Lutheran Church, China Inland Mission, Methodist Church, Evangelical Free Church, and the United Church of Canada. They are still using the lure of money, spreading various reactionary propaganda, and fantasizing that U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang will "attack the mainland" and make a comeback.

    The offices or agents of the missionary societies in Hong Kong collude with Christian scum and collude with U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to carry out anti-people activities. For example, the Lutheran Church's so-called "refugee service" is to serve the Chiang bandit army fleeing to Hong Kong. The Presbyterian Church publishes "Christianity and Communism," "The New Theology of Christianity," and "Reformation Magazine," etc., and sends them from Hong Kong to various places in the country. They have many reactionary publications disguised as religious books, which are sent to the country in large quantities.

    They are doing their utmost to sabotage the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement of Christianity in Guangdong. They used threatening letters to intimidate enlightened people in the churches, and even circled in red pen the news of the responsible pastors and secretaries of the Liangguang Baptist Association signing the declaration and sent it to churches in the South China hinterland to provoke and alienate the internal unity of the church. On another occasion, they used the names of two private individuals in Hong Kong, without going through the Baptist General Organization, to directly send letters to churches in various places, saying that if they needed money, they could send their address and budget, and they would find a way to send money. In addition, they also took the proof of our church property to Hong Kong and did not return it to us.

    They set up theological seminaries or training classes in Hong Kong to cultivate reactionary missionaries. They also used money to lure the heads of Chinese churches to Hong Kong to attend meetings. The Guangdong Association of the Church of Christ in China held a decision-making meeting in Hong Kong last June to discuss the work of the association and the relationship between the association and the missionary societies. The representative of the missionary society said: "We are willing to provide economic assistance, but the funds cannot fall into the hands of the Communist Party." This shows that they are indeed using the church to carry out cultural aggression. The association established an office in Hong Kong before liberation, which was headed by an American imperialist element. It was their idea to set up this office, because it was not convenient to contact after liberation, so it had to be set up. This also shows that their conspiracy is meticulous.

    I am exposing these facts to make us vigilant and pay attention to the tricks of U.S. imperialism in using the Hong Kong church.

    We have been anesthetized by imperialist ideology for a long time and have been running dogs and tools of U.S. imperialism without knowing it. We thank the leadership of the government, which has enabled us to improve our political understanding through study, and we have suddenly realized it. We often have lingering feelings towards U.S. imperialist missionary societies, which is a great mistake. Our Guangdong Branch of the Church of Christ in China is determined to immediately sever economic relations with U.S. imperialism, reject the economic temptation of U.S. imperialism, abolish the original Hong Kong office, and terminate the duties of foreign missionaries residing in Hong Kong. And we are determined to accept the leadership of the government, realize church reform, establish the church of the Chinese people, lead colleagues and believers to study hard, improve political consciousness, and actively participate in the patriotic movement.

　　控诉美国特务骆爱华
    广东基督教协进会总干事　胡翼云
    我以广州基督教青年会董事的地位，控诉青年会前美国干事、美帝国主义分子骆爱华，他的英文名字是：E.H.Lockwood。
    北美协会通过中华基督教青年会全国协会派美国干事到各地青年会，他们都是宣传反共、反苏，散播亲美、崇美、恐美思想的能手，还有不少是从事反人民利益的活动的。解放后，这些美国干事，先后撤离中国，停留在香港和东南亚各地活动，例如广州的布克礼（H.A.Brunger）在香港青年会，长沙的唐克儒（K.Stange）在曼谷，企图是很明显的。
    骆爱华就是许多美国干事中的一个。他身兼百职，担任青年会、教会、学校、医院、救济机关的总干事、董事、委员等职务。在过去三十多年中，特别是抗日战争后到广州解放初期一个时期中，勾结美帝国主义及蒋介石匪帮，进行反动阴谋活动，充分暴露了帝国主义分子的本来面目。他的中国名字叫骆爱华，实实在在是“骆害华”。（笑声）
    抗日战争期间，他在青年会组织“国际问题研究社”，勾结国民党反动头子，进行反动宣传，麻醉毒害青年。解放前，他又主持“国际时势讲座”，宣传原子弹威力，宣传美国是真正的民主，诬蔑苏联是“极权主义”国家，并经常在教会群众中灌输基督教与共产主义对立的思想；又说什么中国没有人才，没有希望，破坏我们的民族自尊心和自信心。
    他和美帝国主义特务机关——美国新闻处的关系是很密切的。通过了他，青年会成了美国新闻处散布反动书刊的代理人：经常把小册子、书籍杂志，分发到华南各地的学校、医院，并放映有毒素的影片，举行各种宣传亲美反苏的讲座。解放后，有一千多本书刊摆在青年会，要我们把读者情况和反应经常报告香港美国新闻处。我们要这样作了，奥斯汀的谰言中，又将多一项重要材料。
    他和美国领事馆关系极为密切。在抗日战争时，他实际是广东曲江的领事。解放后，他是美侨协会主席，实际执行美国领事职务。
    他和国民党反动派，特别是战犯宋子文有密切的关系。不但请那些人到青年会来宣传反苏反共，并经常与宋匪子文、张发奎、李宗仁、余汉谋这一批战犯有往来，他可以随时走进这些反动头子的办公室或家里，他赞扬宋匪子文有才干，有希望，是一个“人物”。一九四七年，蒋匪帮的“要人”欧阳驱、李大超、高信等，出面为他主持六十寿辰的庆贺会。
    骆爱华负责不少救济机构的工作。他的救济工作是怎样作的呢？抗日战争时期，他在曲江主持“国际救济委员会”，支持美国特务亚当斯通过这个机构，调查各地的地形、港湾、交通和生产情况。美国经济合作总署在中国的经济支付，只有三个人有决定权，骆爱华便是其中之一。他们直接与华盛顿联系，毫无疑问地是美国国务院的代理人。
    解放后，从他发出的电报中，发现他还是反动通讯社——美联社的负责人。在解放后的第一个早晨，他就拍电报到美国去。
    通过这些事实，很清楚地可以看到：美帝国主义是怎样有计划地利用教会，培养教会中的美帝国主义分子，进行反动活动。
    另外，我还要揭发美帝国主义利用香港，通过教会来进行侵略和破坏三自运动的情形。
    香港是政治的垃圾堆，也是宗教的垃圾堆。不少基督教败类也先后跑到香港，进行危害中国人民利益的活动。在中国的西差会，不少仍停留在香港，设立办事处，继续进行他们的阴谋活动，如长老会、浸信会、信义会、宣道会、卫理公会、同寅会、加拿大联合会等，仍然利用金钱的引诱，散播种种反动宣传品，并幻想美帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮“进攻大陆”，卷土重来。
    差会的办事处或代理人，在香港勾结基督教败类勾结美帝国主义与蒋介石匪帮，进行反人民活动。如信义会所谓“难民服务”，就是为逃亡香港的蒋匪军服务。约老会编印《基督教与共产主义》、《基督教的新神学》、《改革杂志》等，从香港分寄国内各地，他们有许多以宗教书籍作伪装的反动刊物，大批寄入国内。
    对广东基督教的三自革新运动，他们极力破坏。用恐吓信教威胁会的开明人士，甚至还把两广浸信会联合会负责牧师和干事在宣言上签名的新闻，用红笔圈出寄到华南内地各教会，挑拨离间教会内部的团结。还有一次，他们在香港用两个私人的名义，不通过浸信会总机构，直接寄信给各地堂会，说是如果需要钱，可以把地址和预算寄去，他们将设法寄钱来。另外，他们还把我们教会产业的证明带到香港去，不还给我们。
    他们在香港设神学院或训练班，培养反动的传教人员。他们又利用金钱，引诱中国教会的负责人到香港去开会。中华基督教会广东协会在去年六月，就在香港举行过一次决策会议，讨论协会工作和协会与差会的关系。差会的代表说：“愿意作经济的协助，但经费不能落在共产党手里。”这就可以看出，他们是的的确确利用教会来实行文化侵略。协会在解放前，设立了香港办事处，由美帝国主义分子主持。设这个办事处是他们的主意，因为解放后联系不方便所以要设立，这也可见他们的阴谋是无微不至的。
    我揭发这些事实，是要我们提高警惕，注意美帝国主义利用香港教会的鬼技。
    我们长期受帝国主义思想上的麻醉，做了美帝国主义的走狗、工具还不知道，我们感谢政府的领导，从学习中使我们提高了政治认识，才恍然大悟。我们对美帝国主义的差会，往往存在藕断丝连的心情，这是极大的错误。我们中华基督教会广东分会，决心立即断绝与美帝国主义的经济关系，拒绝美帝国主义的经济引诱，撤消原有驻港办事处，停止居留香港的外国传教士的职务。并决心接受政府领导，实现教会革新，建立中国人民的教会，领导同工和教徒努力学习，提高政治觉悟，积极参加爱国运动。
