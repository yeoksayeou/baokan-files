    Suggestions for Several Beijing Municipal Organizations to Establish Formal Working Systems
    To the Editor:
    Regarding the working systems of Beijing municipal organizations, I would like to offer some suggestions. First, I believe that the working systems of organizations should be formalized, and work should not be excessively rushed. Currently, the working systems of some municipal and district-level organizations in Beijing are rather chaotic, with cadres working from morning till night. Daily working hours often range from ten to twelve hours, and sometimes overtime and late nights are required. This not only hinders the work but also affects the health of the cadres.
    We suggest that all organizations pay attention to the following tasks:
    First, they should establish formal working systems and improve working methods to increase work efficiency and shorten working hours. However, some leading comrades in certain organizations do not pay attention to this point and often one-sidedly believe that whoever works longer hours is more active; those who advocate an eight-hour working system are considered backward and to have the viewpoint of a wage laborer. This kind of leadership thinking implicitly encourages cadres not to study how to improve working methods and increase work efficiency, but to bury their heads in work all day long, resulting in poor work performance and damage to their health.
    Second, they should improve cultural and recreational activities in organizations to regulate organizational life. Many cadres have this requirement, but no one is organizing it. This first requires that the administration and trade unions of each organization attach importance to cultural and recreational activities, carry out this work in an organized manner, and allocate certain funds to purchase necessary cultural and recreational equipment. Cultural and recreational activities in organizations can be diversified. In cultural and recreational activities, education on current affairs and the resistance against America and aid to Korea should be implemented. In this way, it can both promote the physical health of cadres and carry out political and ideological education.
    Third, all organizations should try their best to improve food, and pay attention to environmental hygiene and the treatment of sick comrades. Only by ensuring the health of cadres can work efficiency be effectively improved.

### 建议北京市若干机关建立正规工作制度

    建议北京市若干机关建立正规工作制度编辑同志：
    关于北京市机关工作制度，我提点意见。首先，我觉得机关工作制度应该正规化，工作不宜过于突击。目前，北京有些市、区级机关，工作制度比较混乱，干部从早到晚都在忙碌。每天工作时间总是在十小时到十二小时之间，有时还得突击、开夜车。这样，不但做不好工作，而且影响了干部身体健康。
    我们建议各机关注意这样几件工作：
    第一、应该建立正规的工作制度，改进工作方法，以提高工作效率，缩短工作时间。但目前有些机关的领导同志对这一点是不重视的，常常片面地认为谁的工作时间长，便是积极；对于提倡八小时工作制的人，便认为是落后，有雇佣观点。这种领导思想无形中鼓励了干部不研究如何改进工作方法，提高工作效率，只是整天闷着头干，结果是工作做不好，把身体也搞垮了。
    第二、应该搞好机关文化娱乐活动，调剂机关生活。很多机关干部都有这种要求，但是没有人组织。这首先要求各机关行政、工会重视文化娱乐活动，有组织地开展这一工作，并且拿出一定的经费，购置必要的文化娱乐设备。机关文化娱乐活动可以多样化。在文化娱乐活动中，应该贯彻时事学习和抗美援朝的教育。这样，既可以促进干部身体健康，又可以进行政治思想教育。
    第三、各机关应尽量搞好伙食，并注意环境卫生及患病同志的治疗。只有保证了干部身体健康，才能有效地提高工作效率。
