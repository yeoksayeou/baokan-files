Response to People's Daily Reporter's Criticism and Suggestions

　　Gushi County Accepts Readers' Opinions
　　Handles District and Village Cadres Who Embezzled Loans

Editor:
    The People's Daily published the criticism "Gushi County Should Speed Up Loan Work Inspection" in the "Readers' Letters" column on March 28th. We have conducted an inspection and handling of this matter, and now report the results as follows:
    In December of last year, our county issued 100,000 catties of grain as production loans to the Ninth District to support local disaster victims in production and self-salvation; and instructed the district to distribute all the grain before the Lunar New Year (February 6th). However, Li Shaonan, the district chief, consistently failed to pay attention to this matter. Under repeated urging from higher authorities, he did not distribute all the grain until March 6th. As a result, the development of the disaster situation could not be alleviated at the appropriate time. This kind of attitude of disregarding the interests of disaster victims and being detached from the masses is very wrong. We have submitted a request to the Huangchuan Special Prefecture of Henan Province to give District Chief Li Shaonan a demerit. Furthermore, Jiang Huairen, the township chief of Fenggang Township in the same district, and rogue Wang Zhixun gambled together, losing 180,000 yuan of winter clothing loans, and embezzled 150,000 yuan of feed loans. In addition to recovering these funds, we recommend that Jiang Huairen be dismissed from his post and investigated. Wang Xinquan, a clerk in the Second District, lost 400,000 yuan of winter clothing loans. It was found that the money was stolen by the messenger Liu Chunfu. Liu Chunfu has now been sentenced to three months in prison. Wang Xinquan has been criticized for his careless custody of the funds. Regarding the loss of 2 million yuan of winter clothing loans by Jiang Hongzhi, a financial and grain cadre in the Fifth District, the investigation revealed that it was not due to negligence but rather to Jiang Hongzhi's own embezzlement. Because this case involves other issues, it is currently under investigation and being handled.

### 固始县接受读者意见  处理贪污贷款的区村干部

专栏：对人民日报记者批评建议的反应

　  固始县接受读者意见
　  处理贪污贷款的区村干部编辑同志：
    人民日报三月二十八日《读者来信专页》，刊登了《固始县应速检查贷款工作》的批评。我们已对此事作了检查、处理，今将结果报告如下：
    去年十二月，我县发给九区生产贷粮十万斤，以扶助当地灾民生产自救；并指示该区于旧历年前（二月六日）必须发放完毕。但该区区长李绍南始终未予重视，在上级再三督促下，直至三月六日才将全部粮食贷出。因此，未能在适当时机减轻灾情的发展。这种漠视灾民利益、脱离群众的作风是很不对的。我们已呈请河南省潢川专署给予李绍南区长以记过一次的处分。又该区丰港乡乡长姜怀仁和流氓王治勋等聚赌，致输掉寒衣贷款十八万元，并贪污饲料贷款十五万元。我们除追还这些款项外，建议给予姜怀仁以撤职查办处分。二区文书王新权遗失的寒衣贷金四十万元，查明系被通讯员刘春富盗去。刘春富刻已被判徒刑三个月，王新权保管款项不慎，已予以批评。关于五区财粮干事蒋鸿志遗失寒衣贷款二百万元之事，据调查：并非疏忽大意，乃系蒋鸿志自行贪污；因此案牵涉有其他问题，刻正审讯处理。
