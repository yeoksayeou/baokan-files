How to Sing the "National Anthem" Well
    Feng Yimin

    In order to sing the "National Anthem" correctly and uniformly, I would like to offer a few suggestions for everyone to consider when learning to sing it.

    (1) First, we must have a clear understanding of the political significance of the "National Anthem" ideologically. Everyone should respect and love this song as they respect the "National Flag." Cadres, in particular, should ensure that they sing it correctly from an ideological standpoint.

    (2) We must strictly follow the various notes in the tune. We must not add or subtract a single note; we must not sing half a beat as one beat, or two beats as one and a half beats. If any mistakes are found, they should be corrected immediately with more practice. In general, the following areas are often overlooked:

    This error lies in shifting the word "起" (qǐ, rise) from the second half of the beat to the next measure, which affects the original rhythm of the word "来" (lái, come) and prevents it from being sung with emphasis. At the same time, the word "不" (bù, not) is also shifted from its original position to the next measure, making the syllables in that measure crowded and unclear.

    The original note for the word "把" (bǎ, hold) is on the second half of the beat, but some people lengthen its duration by a factor of two, treating it as a quarter note, which excessively highlights this unimportant word.

    In the former case, the two words "我们" (wǒmen, we) have a small dot, and the word "城" (chéng, city) is sung for two beats, which sounds impassioned and powerful. In the latter case, the two words "我们" (wǒmen, we) do not have a small dot, and the word "城" (chéng, city) is sung for one beat, which sounds short and hurried.

    In the former case, the two words "时候" (shíhou, time) sound like alarm bells, giving a sense of tension. In the latter case, an extra note (2-) is added to the word "时" (shí, time), which makes it sound leisurely and relaxed.

    In the former case, the three words "敌人的" (dírén de, enemy's) are a triplet, and the two words "炮火" (pàohuǒ, artillery fire) are each an eighth note and an eighth rest (i.e., sing for half a beat and rest for half a beat). The entire phrase makes us feel passionate and powerful, full of confidence in victory. The latter two cases sound weak and powerless.

    (3) The tempo is also very important. The national anthem should not be sung too fast or too slow. Too fast is not solemn enough, and too slow seems heavy. It must be well grasped. In short, it should express: solemnity, a firm will to resist aggressive war, and a feeling of full confidence in victory.

    The above may contain inappropriate points, and I hope everyone will study and correct them. (Attached image)

### 怎样把“国歌”唱好（歌曲）

　　怎样把“国歌”唱好
    冯宜民
    为了要把“国歌”唱得正确整齐，我提出几点意见，供大家在学唱时参考。
    （一）首先应在思想上明确认识“国歌”的政治意义，大家应该象尊敬“国旗”一样地尊敬和热爱这首歌。干部尤应从思想上保证正确地唱好它。
    （二）要严格地按照曲子中的各种音符来唱。既不能多添一个音，也不能减少一个音；该唱半拍的，就不能唱一拍；该唱两拍的，也不能唱一拍半。如果发现有唱错的地方，应当立即纠正，多多练习。一般经常不注意的地方，有以下几处：
    这一错误在于把“起”字从后半拍上移到次一小节，因而影响了“来”字的原来节奏，不能用强音唱出来。同时“不”字也从原来位置移到次一小节，使得这一小节的字音拥挤，不鲜明。
    “把”字原曲是在后半拍上，有人却把它的时值加长了一倍，当作四分音符来唱，使这一不重要的字过份突出。
    前者，“我们”二字，曲中有小附点，“城”字唱两拍，听起来，激昂而有气势，后者，“我们”二字，曲中没小附点，同时“城”字唱一拍，这就显得短促。
    前者，“时候”二字，听起来象警钟似地发出紧张的音响，后者，“时”字多添了一个（２－）音，就显得从容缓和了。
    前者，“敌人的”三字，为三连音符，“炮火”二字，都是一个八分音符和一个八分休止符（即是唱半拍停半拍）。整个句子，使我们听起来，感到激昂有力，充满胜利信心。后二者，就显得软弱无力了。
    （三）速度问题也很重要。——国歌不能唱得太快或太慢，太快不够庄严，太慢又显得沉重，须很好掌握，总之要表现出：庄严，坚决反抗侵略战争的斗争意志，和充满胜利信心的感情。
    以上所提，很可能有不当之处，希望大家研究指正。（附图片）
