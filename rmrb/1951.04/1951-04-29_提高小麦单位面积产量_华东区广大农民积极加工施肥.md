　　In order to increase wheat yield per unit area, the broad masses of farmers in East China are actively processing and applying fertilizer.

    Wheat seedlings are growing vigorously in the wheat-producing areas of East China. Currently, the broad masses of liberated farmers are actively hoeing and applying top dressing to strive for increased yield per unit area.

    In areas where there is a tradition of hoeing wheat and applying top dressing, wheat has mostly been hoeed once or twice. In some areas, it has been hoeed three to four times, and efforts are being made to hoe it again one to two times. In areas where there was no tradition of hoeing wheat and applying top dressing in the past, after receiving patriotic education and education on production policies and techniques, farmers have also begun to hoe wheat and apply additional fertilizer. For example, in Shandong, most areas had hoeed once before the Qingming Festival, and are currently hoeing for the second time, with some areas starting to hoe for the third time. In northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and southern Anhui, most areas have been hoeed twice and are in the process of hoeing for the third and fourth times. In southern Jiangsu and Zhejiang, most areas have been hoeed more than three times. Mud fertilizer and manure have been applied as top dressing in most areas, and ash fertilizer, slurry, urine, and fertilizer powder are currently being applied. The amount of top dressing generally exceeds that of previous years, and in some cases has exceeded or reached the level before the Anti-Japanese War.

    In areas with conditions for irrigating wheat fields, most are preparing to irrigate. In the disaster areas of northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui, wheat seedlings have now grown to more than half a foot tall, and local governments are vigorously leading the broad masses of farmers to actively repair rivers and ditches to protect wheat fields. In Fujian Province, the wheat maturity period is earlier, and harvesting has begun in some areas.

　　提高小麦单位面积产量
　  华东区广大农民积极加工施肥
    华东各产麦地区，麦苗旺盛。目前广大翻身农民正在为争取提高单位面积产量而积极进行加工和施追肥。
    有锄麦和施追肥习惯的地区，小麦已大多锄过一遍到两遍。个别地区的已锄过三至四遍，并争取再锄一遍到两遍。过去没有锄麦和施追肥习惯的地区，农民受到爱国主义教育和生产政策、生产技术教育后，也纷纷锄麦和追加肥料。如山东各地，清明前大多锄过一遍，目前正在锄第二遍，个别地区已开始锄三遍。苏北、皖北、皖南地区，大多已锄过二遍，正在锄三遍和四遍。苏南、浙江地区，大多已锄过三遍以上。各地大都已追施泥肥和粪肥，目前正在追施灰肥、粉浆、尿和肥田粉等肥料。追肥数量，一般皆超过往年，有的并超过或达到抗日战争以前的水平。
    有浇麦田条件的地区，大多准备灌水。苏北、皖北北部灾区，麦苗现已长到半尺多高，当地政府正大力领导广大农民积极修治河道沟洫，保护麦田。福建省小麦成熟期较早，部分地区已开始收割。
