　　Shanxi Provincial Report Team Goes Deep into Rural Areas to Publicize the Resist America, Aid Korea Campaign
    Wu Gang, Li Qing
    The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized provincial report teams in batches to go deep into the rural areas to report on current events, which greatly promoted the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in rural areas, and various tasks also advanced accordingly.
  The Reporter's Words are the Key to Opening Hearts and Minds
    The first batch of 120 provincial report team members sent to rural areas in Shanxi Province reported on issues related to the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign to more than 10,000 people in 58 villages in Jinyuan and Yangqu counties over three days from March 31st to April 2nd, and held discussions with 40% of the masses. In mid-April, the Shanxi Provincial Committee organized a second batch of 138 report team members to go to 38 villages and towns, including Chengguan, Baicheng, Shuixiu, and Hucun in Taigu County, to report to the masses on resisting America, aiding Korea, and opposing the US imperialist arming of Japan, and separately organized youth, women, and military families to hold symposiums on resisting America, aiding Korea. Through reports and symposiums, these two batches of report team members further educated the masses on resisting America and aiding Korea, and further strengthened the ties between the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the people.
    When these report team members gave reports in various places, many people listened. The masses were very interested in the reports and raised many difficult questions to the report team members, requesting answers. Yangqu County sent back more than 50 report survey cards, reflecting a common demand from the peasants - welcoming report team members to regularly explain national affairs, introduce policies and regulations, and share production experiences. The peasants said, "Your words are the key to opening hearts and minds." After the report team members explained resisting America, aiding Korea, opposing the rearmament of Japan, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, many people on the spot accused the Japanese invaders, Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's bandit gangs, and other counter-revolutionary elements. Some people handed over portraits of counter-revolutionary elements they recognized to the report team members, asking the government to issue arrest warrants; some people reported the hiding addresses of counter-revolutionary elements when they said goodbye to the report team members, asking the government to severely punish them. The reports of the report team members also helped the masses understand the strength of the forces for peace and strengthened their confidence in the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea. When the report team members were active in Houcheng Town, Taigu County, the masses crowded around to listen to the report team members explain the map. The masses pointed at the map and said, "This large area is the Soviet Union and China, and that large area is the New Democratic countries, all of which are countries that defend peace. With a large land and a large population, our strength is greater than that of the United States!" Some peasants also strengthened their confidence in victory from the comparison between the past and the present: "In the past, the People's Liberation Army stood on the mountain tops, carrying broken guns, and still defeated the Japanese devils; now the whole country is unified, with convenient transportation in all directions, with the army, navy, and air force, with cannons and tanks, as long as we are united, what are we afraid of from the American robbers!" After listening to the report, the masses in Dongliuzhuang, Yangqu County, automatically formulated a patriotic pact to resist America and aid Korea, passed a protest against US imperialism's rearmament of Japan, and donated money to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting on the front lines in Korea.
    While giving reports in various places, the report team members also paid attention to listening to and collecting the masses' demands and opinions on the Communist Party and the People's Government. Many people asked the People's Government to lend out new farm tools and improved varieties, and asked the government's water conservancy bureau to help various places repair waterwheels to ensure the successful completion of this year's agricultural production tasks. The report team members also inspected the situation of Resist America, Aid Korea education in the local area, and found that the atmosphere of Resist America, Aid Korea in some rural areas was still weak. This was mainly due to the unsound leadership at the village level.
  Five Experiences of the Report Team Members
    The Provincial Committee's organization of provincial report team members to go to the countryside to publicize not only set a demonstration role for the province's report team member work, but also gained the following five experiences:
    (1) The reporting areas should be concentrated, so that the masses in this area can receive a deeper education in resisting America and aiding Korea, and make it quickly become a force for promoting all work, changing the political and ideological outlook of the entire area, improving the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses, and promoting the progress of various tasks. The second batch of provincial report team members who set off accepted this experience, and more than 130 report team members concentrated on reporting in Taigu County, which received great results.
    (2) Report team members should have sufficient preparation before departure and make a detailed report outline. After the report team members arrive at the reporting location, they should hold discussions with the cadres, investigate the political, economic, and cultural conditions of the village they are going to, and enrich the content of the report based on these conditions. In the report, local examples familiar to the masses should be used to illustrate the problem. Such reports can be lively and welcomed by the masses. When the report team members reported in Jinyuan County, they used the example of the brutality of the Japanese invaders "Mao Mao Taijun" in the local area to not only explain the atrocities of US imperialism in Korea, but also explain the reason why US imperialism should not be allowed to rearm Japan. Such reports are very effective. The content of the discussion is also to first inspire the masses to recall and accuse the atrocities of the Japanese invaders, Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's bandit gangs, and then conduct discussions in connection with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and production issues. In addition, it is also necessary to study various policies related to rural construction (especially production policies) in order to answer the questions of the peasants.
    (3) During the spring plowing season in rural areas, report team members must also take care of the production difficulties of the masses and use various methods to report to the masses. Report team members give reports to women and children during the day, report to men at night, and use free time to make family visits, so that everyone can receive patriotic education to resist America and aid Korea in different situations.
    (4) When report team members go to rural areas to publicize, they should bring some simple maps, cartoons, and other publicity materials, which are most popular among the masses and make it easy for the masses to accept the content of the report. After seeing the maps and cartoons of the report team members, the masses in Chengguan, Taigu County, said, "Listen to the lecture, look at the pictures, the head and feet are aligned, and the heart is brighter."
    (5) Use the report card system. After the report, the opinions and requirements of the masses are written on the card. Not only do the report team members know the effect of their reports, but also the leaders at the higher level can understand the report location, time, content, number of participating masses, and the opinions and requirements of the masses from the card. The card is also signed by the local cadres, so that the local cadres can understand what opinions and requirements the masses still have; if it can be resolved, it will be resolved for the masses immediately.

　　山西省级报告员深入农村宣传抗美援朝
    吴钢　李青
    中共山西省委分批组织省级报告员深入农村报告时事，大大地推动了农村的抗美援朝运动，各项工作也随着前进一步。
  报告员的话是打开心眼的钥匙
    山西省第一批下乡的省级报告员，共有一百二十名，从三月三十一日到四月二日的三天内，向晋源、阳曲两县五十八个村的一万余群众做了有关抗美援朝问题的报告，并与其中百分之四十的群众进行了座谈。四月中旬，山西省委又组织第二批报告员下乡，共一百三十八名，到太谷县城关、白城、水秀、胡村等三十八个村镇，对群众作了抗美援朝和反对美帝国主义武装日本的报告，并分别组织青年、妇女、军属举行抗美援朝座谈会。这两批报告员，通过报告、座谈会，使群众进一步受到了抗美援朝的教育，并且进一步密切了共产党、人民政府与人民群众的联系。
    这些报告员在各地做报告时，听的群众很多。群众对报告十分感兴趣，并向报告员提出许多疑难问题，要求解答。阳曲县送回五十余张报告调查卡片，反映出农民的一个共同要求——欢迎报告员经常去讲解国家大事、介绍政策法令和生产经验。农民说：“你们的话是打开心眼的钥匙。”报告员讲解抗美援朝反对重新武装日本，以及镇压反革命等问题后，不少群众当场对日寇、蒋阎匪帮等反革命分子进行控诉。有些群众把认识的反革命分子的像片交给报告员要求政府通缉；有的人在送别报告员时，报告了反革命分子隐藏的地址，要求政府严办。报告员的报告还帮助群众认识了和平力量的强大，坚定了抗美援朝必胜的信心。报告员在太谷县侯城镇活动时，群众拥挤着争听报告员讲解地图，群众指画着地图说：“这一大片是苏联和中国，那一大片是新民主主义国家，都是保卫和平的国家，地大人多，咱的力量比美国大！”有些农民又从今昔的对比中，坚定了胜利信心：“从前解放军站山头，扛破枪，还打败了日本鬼子；现在全国统一，四通八达，有陆军、海军、空军，有大炮、坦克，只要咱们齐心，还怕什么美国强盗！”阳曲县东留庄群众，听了报告后自动订立抗美援朝爱国公约，通过反对美帝国主义重新武装日本抗议书，并捐钱慰劳在朝鲜前线作战的中国人民志愿军。
    在各地作报告的报告员，同时注意了听取和收集群众对共产党和人民政府的要求和意见。很多群众要求人民政府贷发新式农具和优良品种，并要求政府的水利局帮助各地修理水车，以保证今年的农业增产任务胜利完成。报告员并检查了当地抗美援朝教育情形，发现某些农村的抗美援朝气氛还稀薄。这主要是村级领导不健全的缘故。
  报告员的五点经验
    省委组织省级报告员下乡宣传，不仅对全省报告员工作起了示范作用，并获得了以下五点经验：
    （一）报告地区要集中，这样容易使这一地区的群众，受到较深刻的抗美援朝教育，并使它迅速成为推动一切工作的力量，改变整个地区的政治思想面貌，提高农民群众的生产情绪，推动各项工作前进。第二批出发的省级报告员，就是接受了这个经验，一百三十余名报告员，集中太谷一县进行报告，收到了很大的效果。
    （二）报告员出发前要有充分的准备，要作出详细的报告提纲。报告员到达报告地点后，应和干部进行座谈，调查所到村的政治、经济、文化情况，并根据这些情况充实报告内容。在报告中，应当运用当地群众所熟悉的事例来说明问题。这样的报告才能生动活泼为群众所欢迎。报告员在晋源县报告时，就用日寇“毛毛太君”在当地的残暴兽行为例，不仅说明了美帝国主义在朝鲜的暴行，并且说明了不能让美帝国主义重新武装日本的道理。这样的报告收效就很大。座谈内容也是先启发群众对日寇、蒋阎匪帮的暴行，进行回忆、控诉，再联系镇压反革命、生产等问题，进行讨论。此外，还要学习有关农村建设的各种政策（特别是生产政策），以便解答农民的疑问。
    （三）在农村春耕时期，报告员还必须照顾群众的生产上的困难，用各种方法对群众进行报告。报告员白天给妇女、儿童做报告，晚上给男人报告，并利用空闲做家庭访问，使每个人在不同的情况下受到抗美援朝的爱国教育。
    （四）报告员到农村去宣传时，应携带一些简明地图、漫画等宣传品，这些东西最受群众欢迎，容易使群众接受报告内容。太谷县城关群众看到报告员的地图、漫画后说：“听听讲，看看画，头脚对起来了，心里就更明亮了。”
    （五）使用报告卡片制度。在报告后，将群众的意见和要求，都写在卡片上。不仅报告员知道自己所作报告的效果，而且上级领导部门也能够从卡片上了解每个报告员的报告地点、时间、内容和参加群众数目、群众的意见和要求。而卡片又是经过当地干部签名，也使当地干部了解群众中还有些什么意见和要求；可以解决的，立刻给群众解决。
