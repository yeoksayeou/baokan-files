　　Northwest, Central South, and East China parts of the region
　　Spring plowing and sowing begin
    Farmers in Henan, southern Anhui, and the Northwest regions of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces and regions are universally engaged in spring plowing, and many areas have begun spring sowing. Farmers in Henan Province have accelerated spring plowing due to the development of patriotic production competitions. More than 20 million mu of spring land across the province have been universally plowed. In the famous cotton-producing areas of Shanzhou and Luoyang, 500,000 mu of cotton fields, and in the tobacco-producing areas of Xuchang and Yexian, more than 800,000 mu of tobacco fields have been plowed and harrowed. Currently, the vast number of farmers are soaking seeds and raising seedlings, preparing for spring sowing. In southern Anhui region, the majority of areas completed land reform this spring, and the production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers is unprecedentedly high. The spring plowing movement has been universally launched throughout the region. In counties such as Qimen and Ningguo, 90 percent of the spring fields have been plowed once or twice. Crops such as wheat, broad beans, and rapeseed in the Huizhou and Xuanzhou regions have been hoed two to three times and fertilized twice.
    In order to strive for a bumper harvest this year, farmers in the Northwest region have made preparations such as repairing canals and digging wells, selecting superior varieties, adding new agricultural implements, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests before spring plowing. Therefore, spring plowing and production in the entire region is progressing smoothly this year. Currently, the more than 20 million mu of wheat fields in Shaanxi Province have been mostly hoed once, and some areas are hoeing a second time. More than 3.5 million mu of cotton fields in the province have been universally plowed twice. Farmers in other provinces such as Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia are actively sowing crops such as wheat.

　　西北中南华东部分地区
　  开始进行春耕春种
    河南、皖南和西北区的陕西、甘肃、青海、宁夏等省区普遍进行春耕，许多地区已开始春种。河南省农民由于开展爱国生产竞赛，提早春耕。全省两千余万亩春地已经普遍翻耕，著名产棉区陕州、洛阳的五十万亩棉田和产烟区许昌、叶县等地八十余万亩烟田已耕、耙完毕。现广大农民正在浸种、育苗，准备春种。皖南区绝大部分地方于今春完成土地改革，广大农民生产热情空前高涨，春耕运动已在全区普遍展开。祁门、宁国等县的春田已有百分之九十犁过一遍至两遍。徽州、宣城等专区的小麦、蚕豆、油菜等作物已锄过两遍至三遍，并都施过两次肥。
    西北地区农民为争取今年丰收，在春耕以前，即做好了修渠打井、选择优良品种、增添新式农具和防治病虫害等准备工作。因此，今年全区的春耕生产进展顺利。现在，陕西省的两千多万亩麦田已大部锄完头遍，有些地区正在锄二遍。全省三百五十余万亩棉田普遍犁过两遍。其他甘肃、青海、宁夏等省农民正在积极播种小麦等作物。          （新华社）
