The Central-South Military and Political Committee Holds Third Meeting
Discussing the Implementation of Three Major Tasks such as Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea

    The Third Meeting of the Central-South Military and Political Committee was held from the 9th to the 16th of this month. The main agenda of this meeting was to discuss the current three central tasks: the patriotic ideological education movement of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, land reform, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries.

    The meeting unanimously agreed that the work in the Central-South region in the past six months has been successful, especially in the three major tasks of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, land reform, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries.

    Regarding the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the patriotic ideological education movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in the Central-South region has been extraordinarily large in scale and rapid in development over the past few months. According to extremely incomplete statistics from various regions, there have been more than 9,600 marches and demonstrations in the region to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, with 25 million participants; more than 31,000 current affairs symposiums, with more than 7 million participants; and 22,000 denunciation meetings, with 9.2 million participants. In this movement, a total of 450,000 propaganda teams and more than 46,000 propagandists and 2,000 speakers were mobilized. From the above series of statistics, it can be seen that this is a widespread movement with national participation. This is the first concentrated expression of the political awareness of the 140 million people in the Central-South region since liberation two years ago. This movement has greatly stimulated the ideological awareness of the masses; strengthened and consolidated the people's democratic united front; promoted various practical tasks; and promoted the participation of young students and workers in military cadre schools. Production competitions among workers, patriotic production increase movements among farmers, stabilization of prices and payment of taxes among industrial and commercial circles, and the Three-Self Patriotic Movement in religious circles have all been launched on the basis of this patriotic ideology.

    Regarding land reform, the period from October to mid-November last year was the period of typical land reform experiments in the Central-South region. At that time, some rural work cadres did not pay enough attention to mobilizing the masses. This shortcoming was somewhat changed after emphasizing the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses. From the second half of November to mid-December, it was a period of focused promotion. Some confusion occurred in some areas in terms of mastering policies and working methods, but due to the timely emphasis by the leading organs on the policy of relying on the masses and advancing steadily, it was quickly corrected, which greatly advanced the work. From mid-December to now, it has been a period of comprehensive development. At present, except for Henan Province, where the planting season is later and land reform work can continue until the wheat harvest, other provinces will conclude in mid-April so as not to violate the farming season and shift to spring plowing and production. In the past six months, a land distribution movement has been carried out in areas with 50 million agricultural population; a review movement combined with the distribution of land certificates has been carried out in areas with 10 million agricultural population; and a movement to clear out bandits, oppose local bullies, and reduce rent has been carried out in areas with nearly 30 million agricultural population. In total, about 90 million people in the region participated in the struggle. In areas where land reform has been completed, about 30 to 50 percent of the cultivated land has been transferred from landlords to the laboring people (in Henan, each person received 2 to 3 mu of land, while in Hunan and Hubei, each person received 1 to 2.5 mu of land). Farmers also received a batch of means of production. In terms of grain alone, each grain-deficient poor and hired farmer received at least 20 jin and at most 100 jin. In these places, landlords also received a share of land and means of production, obtaining the opportunity for labor reform. In the movement, a number of local bullies were brought to justice, a number of counter-revolutionaries were suppressed, and the people's democratic dictatorship was implemented in the vast countryside. Through this movement, the peasant association organizations in nearly 20,000 townships have been consolidated, and a large number of peasant leaders have emerged. Among the agricultural population, 25 to 40 percent of farmers have joined peasant association organizations, laying the foundation for democratic state building. The future plan is to complete land reform in areas with 50 million agricultural population before the spring of 1952 according to time and strength, and the remaining areas with 20 million population (excluding ethnic minority areas) will be completed in the winter of 1952.

    Regarding the suppression of counter-revolutionary work, the latent counter-revolutionary remnants in the Central-South region are still quite large, and the activities of counter-revolutionaries in the past period were also quite serious. The Lingling special agent arson incident alone left more than 2,000 people homeless, with losses amounting to more than 15.9 billion yuan. Last year, more than 5,000 cadres were killed by counter-revolutionaries in the region. In the past, there was a one-sidedly lenient tendency in the work, which resulted in many counter-revolutionaries who were guilty of heinous crimes, unrepentant, and continued to do evil after liberation escaping legal sanctions and not receiving due punishment. Since last autumn, according to the instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and the Supreme People's Court on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, combined with the great movement of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea and land reform, the region has widely launched a struggle to suppress counter-revolutionary activities. In the past few months, the Party, government, military, and people of the region have worked together to implement the correct policy of combining suppression and leniency, uncovered a large number of counter-revolutionary cases, detained and controlled a large number of professional secret agents, habitual bandits, local bullies, and various counter-revolutionary elements who organized riots and harmed people's lives, and executed a number of counter-revolutionary ringleaders who were guilty of heinous crimes, unrepentant, and deeply hated by the people. After these heinous counter-revolutionaries were suppressed, people from all walks of life expressed warm support. Some set up banquets to celebrate, some voluntarily reported bandits and secret agents, some sent intelligence and led the way to capture bandits, or went up the mountains together to catch secret agents. In western Hunan, 10,000 people spontaneously organized to go up the mountains to suppress bandits. Chen Ziliang, the bandit leader in Henan, who had been hiding in a cave for several months, was also found by the masses. After three bandit leaders were executed in Langxu, Guangxi, the people of the whole village spontaneously rose up to search for scattered bandits, and captured more than 130 bandits in less than three days, forming a mass upsurge in suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

    In the summary of the meeting, Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central-South Military and Political Committee, pointed out that the development and deepening of the patriotic ideological education movement of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea is a prerequisite for carrying out all work. Through this movement, it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate the remaining thoughts of worshiping the United States, being pro-American, and fearing the United States, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, recognize our own strength, and establish national self-esteem and self-confidence. Land reform is the basic problem of solving the lives and production of farmers. When farmers obtain land, their production enthusiasm will be high. The country's industrialization construction must be built on the basis of developing agriculture. Facts have proved that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is the demand of the broad masses. In the past, many areas had the deviation of "unlimited leniency," which the masses were dissatisfied with. Now, after severely suppressing the ringleaders and resolute counter-revolutionaries, not only are the broad masses actively supporting it with practical actions, but also the destructive activities of counter-revolutionary elements have been greatly reduced, and various tasks have been able to be carried out rapidly. Therefore, Vice Chairman Deng pointed out that in the future, it is necessary to continue to universally and deeply develop the patriotic ideological education movement of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea; areas that have completed land reform should quickly shift to production, and areas that have not undergone land reform should seize the time to eliminate bandits, oppose local bullies, reduce rent, and mobilize the masses to prepare for land reform; regarding the suppression of counter-revolutionary work, it is necessary to make a big splash, severely suppress the ringleaders, and widely publicize it to the masses, mobilize the masses to report, so as to expand and consolidate the united front and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

　　中南军政委员会举行第三次会议
　  讨论执行抗美援朝等三大任务
    中南军政委员会第三次会议于本月九日至十六日举行。此次会议的主要议题是讨论当前的三大中心工作：抗美援朝爱国主义思想教育运动、土地改革和镇压反革命。
    会议一致认为：半年来中南区的各项工作是有成绩的，特别是在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大工作方面。
    关于抗美援朝运动，数月来中南地区的抗美援朝爱国主义思想教育运动的规模异常巨大，发展异常迅速。据各地极不完全的统计材料，全区抗美援朝游行示威有九千六百多次，参加人数二千五百万人；举行时事座谈会三万一千多次，参加人数七百多万人；举行控诉会二万二千次，参加人数九百二十万人，在这运动中共出动各种宣传队四十五万人，宣传员四万六千多人，报告员二千人。从以上一系列的统计数字中看出，这是一个具有全民性的广泛运动。这是中南区一亿四千万人民解放两年以来政治觉悟程度初次集中的表现。这一运动，大大激发了人民群众的思想觉悟；加强与巩固了人民民主的统一战线；推动了各种实际工作；推动了青年学生、工人参加军事干部学校。工人中的生产竞赛，农民中的爱国增产运动，工商业界的稳定物价、缴纳捐税，宗教界的三自运动，都是在这个爱国主义思想基础上开展起来的。
    关于土地改革，中南区在去年十月至十一月中旬，是土地改革典型试验时期，当时部分农村工作干部不够重视发动群众的工作，这一缺点在强调了放手发动群众的工作方针后，即有所转变。从十一月下半月至十二月半是重点推行时期，局部地区在掌握政策和工作方法方面都发生了一些混乱现象，但由于领导机关即时强调了依靠群众、稳步前进的方针，很快得到纠正，使得工作大大地进展。十二月半至现在，是全面开展时期。目前，除河南省播种季节较晚，土地改革工作还可继续进行到麦收时期外，其他各省都在四月中旬告一段落，以不违农时，转入春耕生产。半年来，在五千万农业人口地区进行了分配土地运动；在一千万农业人口地区结合分发土地证进行了复查运动：在将近三千万农业人口地区进行了清剿土匪、反恶霸和减租运动。综计全区约有九千万人参加了斗争。在已完成土地改革地区，约有占耕地面积百分之三十至五十以上的土地，从地主手中转为劳动人民所有（河南每人分得土地二亩至三亩，湖南、湖北每人分得土地一亩至二亩五分）。农民还得到了一批生产资料。仅粮食一项，每个缺粮的贫雇农民，少的分得二十斤，多的分得一百斤。在这些地方，地主也同样分得一份土地和生产资料，取得劳动改造的机会。各地在运动中法办了一批恶霸，镇压了一批反革命分子，在广大乡村实施了人民民主专政。经过这一运动，已有近二万个乡的农民协会组织得到整顿，涌现出大批农民领袖。农业人口中，已有百分之二十五至四十的农民，加入了农民协会组织，奠定了民主建政的基础。今后计划是按照时间与力量，一九五二年春前在五千万农业人口地区完成土地改革，其余二千万人口地区（除去少数民族居住区）将在一九五二年冬完成。
    关于镇压反革命工作，中南地区潜在的反革命残余势力还相当大，过去一个时期，反革命的活动情况也是相当严重的。仅零陵特务纵火事件，即使二千多人民无家可归，损失达一百五十九亿元之多。去年全区被反革命分子所杀害的干部即达五千余人。过去工作中存在着片面宽大的偏向，致使许多罪大恶极、怙恶不悛及解放后仍继续作恶的反革命分子逍遥法外，没有受到应有的惩罚。自从去年秋季以来，根据中央人民政府政务院和最高人民法院关于镇压反革命活动的指示，结合抗美援朝、土地改革的伟大运动，全区广泛地展开了镇压反革命活动的斗争。几个月来，全区党、政、军、民一致努力，贯彻了镇压与宽大相结合的正确方针，破获了大批反革命案件，关押与管制了大批的职业特务、惯匪、恶霸、组织暴乱残害人民生命的各种反革命分子，并处决了一部分罪大恶极、怙恶不悛、为人民所深恶痛绝的反革命首恶分子。当镇压了这些万恶的反革命分子以后，各阶层人民表示热烈拥护，有的摆酒相贺，有的自动检举土匪特务，有的送情报带路捉匪，或相率上山捉特务。湘西有一万群众自动组织起来上山剿匪。河南匪首陈子亮藏于地洞内数月也被群众搜出。广西朗墟处决了三个匪首后，全村人民自动起来搜捕散匪，不到三天即捉匪一百三十多名，形成了一个群众性的镇压反革命高潮。
    中南军政委员会邓子恢副主席在会议的总结中指出：抗美援朝爱国主义思想教育运动的开展和深入，是进行一切工作的先决条件，要通过这一运动彻底肃清崇美、亲美、恐美的思想残余，分清敌我，认清自己的力量，建立起民族自尊心与自信心。土地改革是解决农民生活与生产的基本问题，农民获得了土地，生产情绪即会高涨。国家工业化建设必须建筑在发展农业的基础上。事实证明：镇压反革命是广大群众的要求，许多地区过去曾发生过“宽大无边”的偏差，群众是不满意的。现在对首恶与坚决的反革命分子加以严厉镇压后，不仅广大群众积极地以实际行动拥护，而且反革命分子的破坏行为也大大地减少了，各项工作也得以迅速开展。因此，邓副主席指出：今后必须继续普遍深入开展抗美援朝爱国主义思想教育运动；已经完成土地改革的地区应迅速转入生产，未经土地改革地区应抓紧时间清除土匪，反对恶霸，进行减租，发动群众，为土地改革准备条件；关于镇压反革命工作，必须大张旗鼓，严厉镇压首恶分子，并要向群众广泛宣传，发动群众检举，以扩大和巩固统一战线，巩固人民民主专政。
