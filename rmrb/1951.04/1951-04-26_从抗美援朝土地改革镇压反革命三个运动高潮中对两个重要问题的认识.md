We are now at a very sharp and tense stage, from the world to China. In terms of the international situation, American imperialists are reckless, fueling the armament of West Germany in Europe, fueling the armament of Japan in Asia, invading Taiwan and Vietnam, and even more frantically invading Korea. They are deliberately trying to be the head of the aggressors and are completely unrepentant. In order to safeguard world peace and to save our neighbors and ourselves, the people are using unparalleled anger and taking practical actions to launch a widespread and in-depth movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. Domestically, American-Chiang Kai-shek agents, traitors with no sense of nation or people, are also lurking and causing trouble everywhere, willing to be enemies of the people. In order to consolidate the revolutionary regime, our People's Government is also taking a resolute and swift stance, on the one hand, accelerating the anti-feudal land reform to eradicate the last roots of the reactionaries, and on the other hand, strengthening the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities to ensure social security. These three movements will continue to be raised step by step and deepened from all aspects in the future. In order to combine the upsurge of these three movements, I would like to raise two important related issues today for discussion with compatriots across the country.

First, understanding the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities from the essence of the people's regime: Why should we resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities today? The reason is very simple, because today's government is the people's own government, everything is for the people, and everything serves the people. For the sake of national security and our own happiness, every one of us (except counter-revolutionaries) should contribute all our strength to love and consolidate this government. As for the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek in the past, it was essentially oppressing the people and exploiting the people. It was a tool used by a few reactionary elements to rule the people. For the sake of our own interests and the future of our country, we must resolutely eliminate it, fundamentally eliminate it. Therefore, suppressing counter-revolutionary activities today is not for others, but for ourselves. This is a very ordinary truth. In areas where land reform has been carried out, the general peasants have raised their political consciousness from their own struggle to turn over, established their own democratic dictatorship, making it impossible for all counter-revolutionary scum to move. However, in cities, because the general unorganized citizens have a relatively vague understanding of politics, they think that if they do not engage in counter-revolutionary activities, they have fulfilled their responsibility to support the government. Therefore, some people take a third-party attitude towards the measures to suppress counter-revolutionary activities and are indifferent. This is the biggest mistake in thinking. We must quickly correct this wrong thinking and recognize that today's government is our own government. All the government's measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries are for the safety and happiness of every people. Everyone, regardless of gender, age, or race, cannot stand idly by and cannot think that this is irrelevant to themselves. In particular, those who have suffered from the oppression and devastation of the reactionary government in the past should have fresh memories of the suffering of those years and feel the pain of the current activities of counter-revolutionary elements. Therefore, everyone should regard the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as their own business. On the one hand, they must strengthen the study of various documents on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, understand the close relationship between suppressing counter-revolutionary activities and their own interests from the ideological level, and strengthen propaganda and education from themselves to others. On the other hand, they must pay attention to the lurking of counter-revolutionary activities, be vigilant at all times, and immediately report any suspicions, in order to assist the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries with practical actions. This is the fulfillment of the responsibility to protect their own government and consolidate their own regime.

Second, strengthening urban-rural exchanges from the economic, political, and cultural aspects: After the land reform, urban-rural exchanges should be strengthened. Many people have realized this issue, but the common view still only starts from an economic point of view and ignores the political and cultural significance of urban-rural exchanges. This is a mistake of looking at problems in an isolated and one-sided way. Of course, the rural areas after land reform have generally increased their productivity, providing a strong condition for China's industrialization. However, this alone obviously does not recognize the comprehensiveness of urban-rural exchanges. Why? I can talk about it in three points.

　　First, from a political point of view: Chinese peasants have been subjected to thousands of years of political and economic exploitation. This time, the world has turned upside down, and they have completely turned over from the sharp class struggle. Their political consciousness has been raised to an unprecedented level, and their position and understanding have been tempered to be stable and clear from the actual struggle. Therefore, they can establish their own democratic dictatorship to defend the fruits of revolutionary victory. Today, they have become the main force in defending the people's regime and a strong ally of the proletarian revolution. Everyone recognizes this point. Let us look back at the urban citizens. Because of the different living environment and the deep anesthesia they have suffered in the past, they have not improved themselves through fierce class struggles since liberation. Therefore, the meaning of the revolution is not clear, and the will of the revolution is not strong. In fact, apart from factories, schools, youth, women, and democratic parties and other organized people's organizations that regularly participate in propaganda and education, it is still not consolidated and improved through actual struggle. As for the general unorganized citizens, because they do not have many opportunities to receive propaganda and education, it is even more impossible to talk about understanding and experiencing from actual struggle. In this way, the political level of the general citizens lags behind the peasants who have turned over through organized struggles. Today, we can no longer look at peasants with the eyes of the past. In some places, we should also learn from peasants. For example, many intellectuals have participated in land reform or visited land reform, and they have more or less gained nourishment from this great movement to enrich their knowledge. If urban and rural areas can have high-level exchanges, then the political struggle experience of peasants will definitely help improve the political understanding of citizens and help the progress of citizens.

　　Second, from a cultural point of view: Citizens are naturally blessed, and their general cultural level is higher than that of peasants. Especially the level of science, hygiene, and art is even higher than that of peasants. However, peasants are not born backward elements. In the past, they were actually limited by economic conditions. I do not know how many talents have been buried. We have discovered the full wisdom and potential of peasants from the land reform movement, which is no less than that of ordinary citizens. Moreover, it has actually proved that their progress is much faster than that of intellectuals. Moreover, after the land reform, any peasant has the requirement to learn culture, and their desire for progress is very urgent. From this point of view, as long as there is the result of urban-rural exchanges in the future, increasing the opportunity for contact between citizens and peasants, peasants will be able to quickly improve the culture of rural areas after receiving the baptism of urban culture. At the same time, on the urban side, they can also absorb a large amount of materials from the rural areas to enrich the cultural content of citizens. There is no doubt about this. As long as we study the situation after the Soviet revolution and examine the rural situation in Northeast China after the land reform, we can get definite proof.

　　Third, from the perspective of China's industrialization: Because China's economy is backward, there are not many industrial workers now, which can only be regarded as the backbone of the basic team in the revolutionary base camp. The vast majority of combatants still belong to the vast peasants. As a result of the land reform, the peasants are competing in production with unparalleled enthusiasm and in the form of mutual assistance and cooperation, striving to increase production. The improvement of the productivity of rural areas after land reform is a universal fact. However, we must not be satisfied with the status quo to build a new China. China must take the road of industrialization, and it must accelerate the road of industrialization. This is an inevitable future. From the rural perspective, it must progress from individual small-scale economic operations to collective operations, and the long-term goal is rural industrialization. From the industrial perspective, it must progress from the current use of low-level machines to the use of high-level machines, and the long-term goal is industrial electrification. However, economic progress is governed by laws. We must not reach the sky in one step. It is impossible to build socialism without going through new democracy. From the perspective of the law of development, strengthening urban-rural exchanges today, improving individual small-scale economy, and improving productivity is actually a necessary process to achieve agricultural industrialization and industrial electrification. Therefore, from the perspective of China's industrialization prospects, we must also seize the time and quickly complete the work of this transitional era. "A journey of ten thousand miles begins with a single step." Therefore, we see the future, and we must not ignore the present.

　　Of course, we admit that after the land reform, rural production has gradually embarked on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation from individual small-scale economic operations to improve productivity. However, at the same time, we should also recognize that China must complete industrialization to ensure the success of the construction of a new democratic society, and then it can achieve socialism. From the perspective of revolutionary requirements, it can establish a country that is truly led by the proletariat—the workers. Therefore, all ideas and understandings should be based on workers as the main body (naturally, workers in a broad sense). Generally, peasants have not actually realized this. In order to improve the productivity and political understanding of peasants so that they can enter the stage of socialism from the stage of land reform, then, of course, the peasant class also needs to learn from the working class. Whether in technology or ideology, this point should be emphasized. So how can we achieve this goal? At present, the only way is to strengthen urban-rural exchanges, which can also be said to be worker-peasant exchanges, so that peasants can visit large-scale collective production more often, so that they can broaden their horizons and improve their understanding of China's industrialization prospects from the visits and studies, increase their courage to further advance, and unite them to jointly struggle for a common ideal—the ideal of socialism.

　　Compatriots! After listening to my opinions, there will probably be no more misunderstandings in thinking about the two important issues we have raised. We can probably recognize that: understanding the activities of suppressing counter-revolutionaries from the essence of the people's regime, and strengthening urban-rural exchanges from the economic, political, and cultural aspects are indeed the primary issues in the current upsurge of the patriotic movement. In order to provide you with a reference, I must also summarize my opinions and put forward a few specific implementation methods. Please pay attention:

　　1. To strengthen the study of documents on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities: such as the decrees on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities promulgated by the Central Government several times, Comrade Peng Zhen's report, Chairman Mao's On the People's Democratic Dictatorship, Lenin's State and Revolution, Stalin's speeches on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, etc., should be combined with oneself, humbly studied, and the necessity and importance of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities should be understood from the ideological level.

　　2. To assist the government in suppressing counter-revolutionary activities with practical actions: To always be vigilant, pay attention to the surrounding things and the dynamics of their relatives and friends, and immediately report any suspicions.

　　3. In the actual movement of urban-rural exchanges, we will launch universal and in-depth publicity and education work on the current central issues of resisting America, aiding Korea, opposing the armament of Japan, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and combine them with the enthusiastic upsurge of the patriotic production movement and consolidating national defense to implement a comprehensive mobilization to achieve a consistent and in-depth effect in urban and rural areas.

　　4. In rural areas where land reform has been carried out, we must grasp the direction of organization, further organize peasants to visit factories and learn from workers. In cities, we must grasp the correct industrial and commercial policies, organize the economic power of urban citizens in a planned way, and go deep into rural areas to assist the government in accelerating the circulation of materials and finance, and give full play to the economic and political exchange between urban and rural areas.

　　5. Seize the time to quickly complete the land reform in the suburbs of cities across the country. In the suburbs where land reform has been carried out or where anti-despot struggles have been carried out, we will universally promote urban-rural round-trip visiting groups or regularly hold urban-rural symposiums in a planned way to strengthen comprehensive exchange and propaganda.

　　从抗美援朝土地改革镇压反革命三个运动高潮中对两个重要问题的认识
    陈铭枢
    从世界到中国，现在正处在一个非常尖锐而紧张的阶段。以国际形势说，美帝国主义者已不顾一切，在欧洲加油武装西德，在亚洲加油武装日本，侵略台湾、越南，更疯狂地侵略朝鲜。他处心积虑，甘为戎首，已是毫无悔悟。我们为了保障世界的和平，为了救邻自救，人民正以无比的愤怒，拿实际行动，展开了普遍而深入的抗美援朝保家卫国运动。从国内说，美蒋的特务，毫无国家民族观念的败类，也正在各处潜伏捣乱，甘与人民为敌，我人民政府为了巩固革命政权，也以坚决而迅速的姿态，一方面加速进行反封建的土地改革，以拔掉反动派的最后根子，一方面就加强镇压反革命活动，以保障社会治安。这三种运动，今后还要从各方面步步提高，步步深入，为了结合这三种运动的高潮，我今天特别提出两个有关的重要问题，同全国同胞讨论一下。
    第一是由人民政权的本质，认识镇压反革命活动：我们今天为什么要坚决地镇压反革命活动呢？理由很简单，因为今天的政府，是人民自己的政府，一切为了人民，一切服务人民，我们为了国家的安全，为了自己的幸福，我们每一个人（除了反革命之外）都应该贡献一切力量，来爱护，来巩固这个政府。至于过去蒋介石那种反动政府，在本质上根本是压迫人民的，剥削人民的，它是少数反动分子用来统治人民的工具，为了我们本身的利益，为了我们国家的前途，所以我们要坚决消灭它，从根本上来消灭它，因此今天镇压反革命活动，并不是为了别人，乃是为了自己，这是一个很平凡的真理。土地改革了的地区，一般农民，都从本身的翻身斗争中提高政治觉悟，建立了自己的民主专政，使一切反革命败类无法活动，但在城市中，因为一般无组织的市民，对政治的认识，比较模糊，以为自己不做反革命活动，就以为是尽了拥护政府的责任，因此对于镇压反革命活动的措施，有些采取一种第三者的态度，漠不关心，这是思想上最大的错误。我们必须赶快改正这种错误思想，要认识今天的政府，是自己的政府，今天政府的一切镇压反革命措施，都是为了每个人民的安全幸福，每一个人，无论男女老少，都不能置身度外，不能以为这是与自己无关的事，尤其是过去曾经受过反动政府压迫摧残的过来人，回想当年的苦痛，应当记忆犹新，对于目前反革命分子的活动，感到切肤之痛，所以，每一个人，都应该把镇压反革命的事当作自己的事，一方面要加强各种关于镇压反革命文件的学习，从思想上认识镇压反革命活动和自己的切身关系，并且要由己及人加强宣教，一方面要注意反革命活动的潜伏，随时警惕，如有可疑，更要立即检举，以实际行动来协助政府镇压反革命，这才是尽了爱护自己政府巩固自己政权的责任。
    第二是从经济政治文化上加强城乡交流：在土地改革后，应该加强城乡交流，关于这个问题许多人已经认识得到，可是普通的观点，仍只单纯从经济观点出发，而忽略了城乡交流在政治上与文化上的意义，这是犯了孤立的片面的看问题的毛病。固然土地改革以后的农村，已普遍提高了生产力，为中国工业化提供了有力条件，然而仅仅是这样显然没有认识到城乡交流的全面性。为什么呢？我可以分三点来谈谈。
    一、从政治上讲：中国的农民，过去受了几千年的政治的经济的压榨，此次天翻地覆，从尖锐的阶级斗争中完全翻了身，他们的政治觉悟已是空前的提高了，他们的立场与认识，已由实际斗争中锻炼得稳定而明确，所以才能建立自己的民主专政，来保卫革命的胜利果实，在今天已成为保卫人民政权的主力军，成为无产阶级革命有力的同盟者，这一点大家的认识都是肯定了的。我们再回头来看城市市民的一面，因为生活环境不同，过去受的麻醉太深，解放以后，又没有经过激烈的阶级斗争来提高自己，所以革命的意义不明确，革命的意志不坚强，事实上除了工厂、学校，青年、妇女和民主党派与其他有组织的人民团体经常参加宣传教育外，然而还不是从实际斗争中来巩固提高，至于一般无组织的市民，因为受到宣传教育的机会不多，更谈不上说从实际斗争中去认识体会了。这样一来，一般市民的政治水平，反落在经过组织斗争的翻身农民之后，今天我们已不能拿过去的眼光来看农民，有些地方，还应当向农民学习。例如许多知识分子参加土地改革或参观土地改革以后，都或多或少从这个大运动中取得了营养来丰富自己的知识，假如城乡能够高度交流，那么农民的政治斗争经验，一定可以帮助市民政治认识的提高，帮助市民的进步。
    二、从文化上来讲：市民因为得天独厚，在一般的文化水准上是比较农民为高的。尤其是科学的卫生的文艺的水准，更在农民之上。但是农民并非天生落后分子，过去实为经济条件的限制，不知埋没了多少天才。我们由土地改革运动中，已发现了农民丰满的智慧潜力，并不在一般市民之下，而且事实上已经证明了，他们的进步比知识分子的速度还要快得多，而且从土地改革以后，任何农民，都有学习文化的要求，他们要求进步的心情是十分迫切的。由这样看来，今后只要有城乡交流的结果，增多市民与农民两者接触的机会，农民在接受了城市文化洗礼之后，必可很快地提高了农村的文化，同时在城市一方面，也可以从农村方面吸取广大的材料，来丰富市民的文化内容，这是毫无疑问的。我们只要研究下苏联革命后的情况，考察下我国东北在土地改革以后的农村情况，便可得到确切的证明了。
    三、从中国工业化的远景来讲：中国因为经济落后，现在的产业工人不多，仅能看作革命大本营基本队伍的基干，而绝大多数的战斗员，仍属于广大的农民，由于土地改革的结果，农民正以无比的热情，以互助合作的方式，作生产上的竞赛，争取生产量的增加，土地改革后的农村生产力的提高，已是普遍的事实。但我们要建设新中国，决不是以现状为满足，中国要走工业化的路，并且要加速走工业化的路，这是必然的前途，从农村说，一定要由个体的小经济经营进步到集体化的经营，远景是农村工业化。从工业来说，更要由现在的低级的机器使用进展到高度的机器使用，远景是工业电气化。但经济的进步是有规律性的，我们决不能一步登天，不经过新民主主义就不可能建设社会主义，从发展的规律说来，今天加强城乡交流，改进个体小经济，提高生产力，实为达到农业工业化，工业电气化的必由过程。所以，从中国的工业化远景看，我们也必须争取时间，赶快完成这个过渡时代的工作，“万里之行，始于足下”，因此我们看到将来，更不可忽略了现在。
    固然，我们承认土地改革后的农村生产，农民已由个人的小经济经营，慢慢走上互助合作之路，来提高生产力，但同时我们更应当认识，中国必须完成工业化的建设，才可保障新民主主义社会建设之成功，然后才可达到社会主义。从革命的要求说，才可建立真正以无产阶级——工人为领导的国家，所以一切应该以工人为主体（自然是广义的工人）这一个思想认识，一般农民，自然还没有从实际上体会得到，我们为了提高农民的生产力和政治认识，以便由土地改革关进入社会主义关，那么，农民阶级当然还有向工人阶级学习的必要。无论在技术上或思想上，都应该强调这点。那么如何才可以达到这个目的呢？在目前唯一的道路，便是加强城乡交流，也可以说使工农交流，使农民多多参观大规模的集体生产，使他们从参观学习中扩大眼光，提高对于中国工业化的远景认识，增加他们再进一步的勇气，使他们结合在一起，为共同的理想——社会主义的理想而共同奋斗。
    同胞们！在听了我的意见之后，对于我们提出的两个重要问题，在思想上，大概不会再发生什么误解，我们大概可以认识到：由人民政权的本质，认识镇压反革命的活动，和从经济政治文化上加强城乡交流这两个问题，确是在目前爱国运动高潮中的首要问题。为了提供各位的参考，我还得综合下我的意见，提出几点具体实施办法来，请各位注意：
    一、要加强镇压反革命活动的文件学习：如中央几次公布的镇压反革命活动的法令，彭真同志的报告，毛主席的论人民民主专政，列宁著的国家与革命，斯大林关于镇压反革命活动的言论等等，都要结合自己，虚心学习，从思想上认识镇压反革命活动的必要性与重要性。
    二、以实际行动协助政府镇压反革命活动：要经常提高警惕，注意到周围的事物，和自己亲友的动态，一遇可疑，马上检举告发。
    三、由城乡交流的实际运动中，将抗美援朝反对武装日本和镇压反革命的当前中心问题掀起普遍深入的宣传教育工作，并结合在爱国生产运动和巩固国防的热烈高潮中贯彻全面发动达到城乡一致深入的效果。
    四、在已进行土地改革的农村，必须掌握组织起来的方向，进一步组织农民多多参观工厂向工人学习，在城市必须掌握正确的工商政策有计划地组织城市市民经济力量，深入农村，协助政府加速物资金融的流转，充分发挥城乡间经济的政治的交流作用。
    五、争取时间，迅速完成全国城市的郊区土地改革，在已进行土地改革或已进行反恶霸斗争的郊区，则普遍推进城乡轮回参观团或经常有计划地举办城乡座谈会，加强全面的交流宣传。
