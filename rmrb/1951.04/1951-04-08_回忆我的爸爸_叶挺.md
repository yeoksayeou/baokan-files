Remembering My Father – Ye Ting
    Attached High School of Normal University, Ye Huaming

    My father has been gone for five whole years.

    Dad: I really didn't expect you to die so early. You were only fifty years old in 1946! I can't believe, no matter what, I can't believe you only lived to be fifty and died like that!

    Dad was a loyal servant of the people, loyal to the Party, loyal to the people. I am honored to have such a good father, and I will always remember my good father.

    The life my father lived in Enshi after being arrested in 1944 seems like it was just yesterday.

    Dad's personal life was exceptionally frugal.

    I remember clearly: Dad usually wore a gray-white shirt and a pair of blue-gray trousers, and only changed into a white fine cloth Zhongshan suit when he went out.

    In those dark days, labor took up most of Dad's time. He opened up more than one mu of wasteland on the hillside, planting tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and beans; he also raised nineteen chickens, more than twenty ducks, four pigs, and twenty-odd rabbits, which solved our (Dad, my older brother, younger sister, and me) problem of having enough to eat.

    Even in the most difficult environment, Dad did not forget to seize the time to educate us. Dad often told us stories of the Great Revolution.

    Dad was a regiment commander during the Great Revolution, and his regiment defeated the warlord Wu Peifu and was the first to occupy Wuhan. At that time, people called that regiment the "Iron Army."

    Dad once told us: "I was arrested by that kid Chiang Kai-shek. It doesn't matter that I was arrested, it's just a pity that I can't do more for the Party. Now I have no work to do every day, and I can't even see good books and newspapers. You must remember this sentence: 'Chiang Kai-shek, that bastard, is always our enemy.'"

    I still keep a poem called "Prison Song" written by my father in the "Zhazidong" prison:

    "The door for people to enter and exit is tightly locked
    The hole for dogs to crawl out of is open
    Crawl out
    I’ll give you freedom
    I long for freedom
    But I deeply know
    How can a human body crawl out of a dog hole
    I—
    Hope that one day
    The underground fire
    Will burn me together with this living coffin
    I—
    Should gain eternal life in flames and blood"

    At that time, around Dad, apart from us brothers and sisters, were all dog secret agents. There were "orderlies" sent by the Kuomintang at home, and those dog eyes stared at us all day long. Even we ignorant children were followed by dog secret agents when we went out. Dad often "jokingly" said: "I am very relieved when you go out, with 'guards' protecting you."

    The secret agents used all kinds of tricks. Guo Chan, the head of the secret agents, once said to Dad: "Commander Ye, you better go out and do some work, either public or secret, we can give it to you, and life will be much better!"

    Dad was furious when he heard this, picked up a teacup and smashed it on the table, saying: "Ye Ting will serve the Communist Party and the people for the rest of his life."

    In Enshi, we didn't even have the freedom to read books and newspapers. All you could see were dirty things that distorted the facts. Even letters from Mom, Dad could only hide in the quilt and secretly read with a flashlight.

    Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents used such shameless methods to deal with a revolutionary worker.

    On March 3, 1946, under the pressure of the people across the country, the Kuomintang had to release Dad.

    On the 4th, Dad sent a telegram to the Party Central Committee, requesting to restore his Party membership. This is the most important thing in a person's life. The Party Central Committee approved Dad's request. Father became a glorious Communist Party member again!

    The War of Resistance was won, and the people were happy to live a good life! But Chiang Kai-shek used the mediation of the American special envoy Marshall as a cover to actively prepare for the civil war. In July 1946, Chiang Kai-shek tore up his own "Four Promises" and frantically attacked our liberated areas. The so-called American special envoy Marshall also slipped away.

    Dad sacrificed on April 8, 1946, during Chiang Kai-shek's insincere "negotiations"! Dad had just come out of prison and hadn't had the chance to do more and better work for the Party and the people, and he was killed by American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek.

    I know who is responsible for Dad's death. American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, whom it single-handedly supported, should bear full responsibility. "Chiang Kai-shek, that bastard, is always our enemy!" Dad's words are deeply engraved in my heart.

    Dad: Now the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have stood up! Our national flag – the five-star red flag – is waving in the sky of the motherland. This is not an ordinary red flag, this is a red flag dyed with the blood of countless revolutionary soldiers, and Dad's blood is also on it!

    Dad: I will not forget the fruits exchanged for blood. Now American imperialism wants to invade our motherland again. Dad: I promise you: I will actively participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. This is what your good son should do. I will always remember your words: "Chiang Kai-shek, that bastard, is always our enemy!" American imperialism is also always our enemy!

    Dad: Although you will not come back! But what Dad said will always live in my heart, forever.

    Dad turned to ashes – on the land of our own motherland. These ashes fertilized the land, growing clusters of fresh red flowers. We must protect these flowers, so that they bloom better and grow more vigorously.

    Dad: I am now a member of the Communist Youth League. I must study hard, strive to improve myself, and strive to become a glorious Communist Party member. This is what I should do, and I think I will definitely be able to do it.

    Dad: Rest in peace!

　　回忆我的爸爸——叶挺
    师范大学附中　叶华明
    爸爸牺牲了整整五年了。
    爸爸：我真想不到你会死得那样早。一九四六年你才五十岁呀！我想不到，无论如何我也想不到你只活了五十岁就那样的死了！
    爸爸是人民的忠臣，他忠于党，忠于人民。我有这样的好爸爸，是感到光荣的，我要时时刻刻记住我的好爸爸。
    一九四四年爸爸被捕后在恩施的生活，想起来好像就在眼前。
    爸爸的个人生活，是异常俭朴的。
    我记得清清楚楚：爸爸平时穿一件灰白色的衬衣，一条青灰色的长裤，出门时才换一套白细布的中山装。
    在那段黑暗的日子里，劳动占去了爸爸大部分的时间。他在山坡上开了一亩多荒地，种了些西红柿、红薯、豆角；另外还养了十九只鸡，二十多只鸭子，四条猪和二十几只兔子，这样才解决了我们（爸爸、哥哥、妹妹和我）的吃饭问题。
    在最艰苦的环境里，爸爸也不忘记抓紧时间教育我们。爸爸时常给我们讲大革命的故事。
    爸爸在大革命时任团长，他的那个团打败了军阀吴佩孚，最先攻占了武汉。当时人们称那个团为“铁军”。
    爸爸曾告诉我们：“我被捕是蒋介石那小子干的，我被捕是不要紧的，只可惜自己不能为党多做一些事。现在我天天没有工作做，连好的书报都看不到。你们一定要记住这句话：‘蒋介石这混账东西永远是我们的敌人。’”
    我现在还保留着爸爸在“渣滓洞”监牢里写的一首叫《囚歌》的诗：
    “为人进出的门紧锁着
    为狗爬出的洞敞开着
    爬出来吧
    给你自由
    我渴望自由
    但我深深地知道
    人的身躯怎能从狗洞子里爬出
    我——
    希望有一天
    地下的烈火
    将我连这活棺材一齐烧掉
    我——
    应该在烈火与热血中得到永生”
    那时，在爸爸的周围除了我们弟兄以外，尽是些狗特务。家里有国民党派来的“勤务兵”，那些狗眼睛一天到晚盯着我们，连我们这些不懂事的小孩子出门时背后也跟着狗特务。爸爸常“幽默”地说：“你们出去，我很放心，有‘警卫员’保护着你们”。
    特务们什么手段都使得出来。特务头子郭忏曾对爸爸说：“叶军长，你最好出去做点工作，露面的或者不露面的工作，我们都可以给你，那样生活要好得多呀！”
    爸爸一听大怒，拿起茶杯就往桌上一砸，说：“叶挺是终身为共产党、为人民做事的。”
    在恩施，我们连看书报的自由都没有。给你看的尽是一些歪曲事实的脏东西。连妈妈写来的信，父亲都只能躲在被窝里，拿手电筒偷偷地看。
    蒋介石特务们，就是用这样无耻的手段来对付一位革命工作者的。
    一九四六年三月三日，国民党在全国人民的压力下，不得不释放了爸爸。
    四号，爸爸就打电报给党中央，请求恢复党籍，这是人的一生中最重要的事呀。党中央批准了爸爸的要求。父亲又重新成为一个光荣的共产党员了！
    抗战胜利啦，老百姓正高兴要过好日子啦！蒋介石却用美国特使马歇尔调停作掩护，积极进行了内战准备工作。一九四六年七月，蒋介石把他自己发表的什么《四项诺言》，扯成废纸，疯狂地向我们解放区进攻，所谓美国特使马歇尔也溜之乎也。
    爸爸就在蒋介石不诚心的“谈判”下，于一九四六年四月八日牺牲啦！爸爸刚从监狱出来，还没有更好更多地为党为人民做工作，就这样被美国帝国主义和蒋介石害死了。
    我知道爸爸的死，是该谁来负责的。是应由美帝国主义和它所一手扶植的蒋介石负完全责任的，“蒋介石这混账东西永远是我们的敌人！”爸爸这句话深深地刻在我的心中。
    爸爸：现在中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，已经站起来啦！我们的国旗——五星红旗在祖国的天空招展着，这不是普通的红旗，这是无数革命战士用血染成的红旗，这上面也有着爸爸的血呀！
    爸爸：我不会忘记这用血换来的果实。现在美帝国主义又想来侵犯我们的祖国了。爸爸：我向你保证：我要积极参加抗美援朝运动。这是你的好儿子所应该做的。我永远记着你的话：“蒋介石这混账东西永远是我们的敌人！”美帝国主义也永远是我们的敌人！
    爸爸：你虽然不会回来了！但爸爸说过的话，却永远活在我的心中，直到永远。
    爸爸变成灰了——在我们自己祖国的大地上。这些灰，肥润了大地，长出一丛丛鲜洁的红花来。我们要保护这花，使它开得更好，长的更茁壮。
    爸爸：我现在是个青年团员，我一定要好好地学习，努力提高自己，争取当一个光荣的共产党员。这是我应该做的，我想我一定能够做到的。
    爸爸：安息吧！
