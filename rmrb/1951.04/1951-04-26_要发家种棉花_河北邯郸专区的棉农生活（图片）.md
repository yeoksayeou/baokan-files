“Get Rich by Growing Cotton”
Life of Cotton Farmers in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province
By our special correspondent photographer Zheng Jingkang

The vast number of farmers in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, completed the cotton planting plan for 1950, which not only increased farmers' income but also supplied industrial raw materials to the country. This is the bustling downtown area of Handan. Farmers are bustling and crowding the streets. Some are busy buying fertilizers and farm tools, preparing for this year's expanded production; others are selling cotton and exchanging it for needed daily necessities.

Li Youxin, a farmer in Boyan Village, Wu'an County, teaches his two children to read every day after work. He said to the children: "Chairman Mao led us to stand up and made us rich. So you must study hard and serve the people in the future."

According to the "Instructions on Guaranteeing the Price Ratio between Cotton and Grain" issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, the supply and marketing cooperative of Boyan Village, Wu'an County, purchases cotton at a price ratio of 8.5 jin of millet for every jin of 7/8 inch medium-grade lint cotton. This not only guarantees textile raw materials but also increases farmers' income.

    河北省邯郸专区的广大农民完成了一九五○年的种棉计划，不仅增加了农民的收入，而且还供给了国家的工业原料。这是邯郸的闹市，农民们熙熙攘攘地挤满了一街，有的忙着买肥料、买农具，准备今年的扩大生产；有的卖掉棉花，换回需用的日用品。
