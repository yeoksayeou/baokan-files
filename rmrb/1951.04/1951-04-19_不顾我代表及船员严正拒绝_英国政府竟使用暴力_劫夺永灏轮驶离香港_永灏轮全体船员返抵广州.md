Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 18th: Our Yonghao oil tanker, which had been repeatedly obstructed from returning home by the British government in Hong Kong, was unreasonably "requisitioned" by the British government on April 7th under the false pretense of "public interest." Shao Liang, the representative of the China Oil Tanker Company stationed in Hong Kong, and Zuo Wenyuan, the captain of the ship, solemnly rejected this unreasonable measure by the British side on the spot, and pointed out that the Yonghao Wheel is the state property of the People's Republic of China, and the British government in Hong Kong has no right to "requisition" it. All 60-plus crew members of the Yonghao Wheel also expressed their indignation, united as one, and stood firm on the ship, firmly refusing British government personnel from boarding. They persisted until 12:00 noon on the 12th, when multiple naval vessels from the Hong Kong Police Station, fully loaded with armed police, suddenly surrounded our Yonghao oil tanker. At 12:30, P.B. Low, the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong Maritime Department, boarded the ship alone and once again put forward a so-called "emergency order," falsely claiming that "for the public interest," he was "requisitioning" our Yonghao Wheel. Captain Zuo Wenyuan of the ship once again rejected it based on reason. At this time, more than 200 policemen equipped with submachine guns, rattan shields, and tear gas weapons had climbed onto the ship from both sides using their own ladders and were deployed. Low then issued an "ultimatum," forcing all our employees to leave the oil tanker within half an hour. All the employees of the ship were extremely resentful of this shameless and unreasonable act by the British government in Hong Kong, and they still stood firm at their posts without budging. After a stalemate of about half an hour, the police whistle suddenly sounded, and the British police on the deck immediately scattered into firing positions, creating an extremely tense situation. Low once again threatened the employees of the ship, and under the order of the Hong Kong Police Commissioner, he arbitrarily tore down our solemn national flag. When our national flag was forcibly lowered, all the employees were extremely angry and shed tears. By 3:00 p.m., the thugs forcibly removed all the employees of the ship from the ship by force. When all the crew members left the ship, they sang the national anthem loudly with high spirits, expressing their angry protest against the British government's despicable act of hostility towards our People's Republic of China.

　　It is reported that the Yonghao oil tanker has been handed over to the British Navy and has sailed away from Hong Kong. The day after this incident occurred, the British Colonial Secretary Griffiths made a statement, exposing that the Hong Kong British government's "requisition" of the Yonghao oil tanker had been authorized by the London British government; the British government was unwilling to let the Yonghao Wheel return to China because, according to him, it might endanger the safety of the American and British aggressor troops in Korea; at the same time, "the British government decided to requisition the ship for its own needs." Griffiths's statement shows that the so-called "public interest" of the Hong Kong British government is nothing else but the aggressive interests of the American and British aggressor troops; and the British government's act of hijacking the Yonghao Wheel this time is not for anything else, but to curry favor with and ingratiate itself with its American master; its real purpose is to rob us of the state property of the People's Republic of China and serve their policies of aggression and war.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 18th: Captain Zuo Wenyuan and all 60 crew members of the "Yonghao" oil tanker, belonging to our shipping company, which was armed and hijacked by the British government in Hong Kong, returned to Guangzhou at 6:00 p.m. on the 15th. More than 300 representatives from the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the South China Committee of the China Seamen's Union, the Guangzhou Branch of the China Shipping Company, and the Guangzhou Port Authority went to the station to greet them and express their warm regards.

　　不顾我代表及船员严正拒绝
    英国政府竟使用暴力
    劫夺永灏轮驶离香港
    永灏轮全体船员返抵广州
    【新华社广州十八日电】曾遭香港英国政府百般阻挠不得归国的我永灏号油轮，于四月七日被英国政府妄称“为了公众利益”无理地加以“征用”。我中国油轮公司驻香港代表邵良及船长左文渊对于英方这种无理措施，曾当场加以严正拒绝，并指出永灏轮是中华人民共和国的国家财产，香港英国政府无权“征用”。永灏轮全体六十余位船员也一致表示愤慨，并团结一致坚守船上，严拒英国政府的人员上船。坚持到了十二日正午十二时，香港警署水师轮多艘，满载武装警察，突然密密包围我永灏油轮。十二时三十分，香港海事处副处长鲁氏（P.B.Low）单独登轮，再度提出所谓“紧急命令”，妄称“为了公众利益”，“征用”我永灏轮。该轮左文渊船长当又依理拒绝。这时，配备有冲锋枪、藤盾及催泪武器的二百余警察，已从该轮两傍依自备的吊梯攀登上船，布置就绪后，鲁氏即提出“最后通牒”，迫令我全体员工半小时内离开油轮。该轮全体员工对香港英国政府此种无耻无理的行径痛恨万分，仍坚守岗位不移。僵持约半小时后，忽然响起警笛，甲板上的英方警察，立即散开作射击姿态，情势极为紧张。鲁氏再次向该轮员工施以威逼，并在香港警察署长的命令下，竟擅自扯下我庄严的国旗。当我国旗被强行降落时，全体员工愤极落泪。至下午三时，暴徒们以武力强迫该轮全体员工离船。全体船员离船时，高唱国歌，情绪激昂，对英国政府这种敌视我中华人民共和国的卑鄙行为，表示愤怒的抗议。
    永灏油轮据报已经被移交给英国海军，并已驶离香港。在这事件发生的第二天，英国殖民地大臣葛里菲斯发表谈话，暴露了香港英国政府的“征用”永灏油轮，曾经伦敦英国政府授权；英国政府不愿让永灏轮回到中国来，因为据他说是这样可能会危及在朝鲜的美英侵略军的安全；同时，“英国政府为了自己的需要，才决定征用该轮”。葛里菲斯这个谈话说明了香港英国政府的所谓“公众利益”不是别的东西，正是美英侵略军的侵略利益；而英国政府这次劫夺永灏轮的行为不是为了别的，正是为了向他的美国主子邀宠献媚；其真正目的在把我们中华人民共和国的国家财产劫夺了去，为他们的侵略政策和战争政策服务。
    【新华社广州十八日电】为香港英国政府武装劫夺的我国轮船公司所属“永灏”号油轮船长左文渊及全体船员六十人，已于十五日下午六时返抵广州。广东省总工会筹委会、中国海员工会华南区委员会、中国轮船公司广州分公司及广州区港务局等单位代表三百余人前往车站迎接，并热烈向他们慰问。
