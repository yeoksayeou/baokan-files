　　East China Land Reform Enters Completion Stage
　　Broad Rural Areas Launch Resist-America, Aid-Korea, and Great Production Movement
    The land reform movement in the provinces and administrative regions of East China has largely entered the completion stage, and enthusiastic and active farmers are pouring into the spring plowing and production movement. As of early April, more than 33,000 townships (or villages) in the East China region have either completely completed land reform and issued land certificates, or have completed the land distribution work. Currently, only more than 9,000 townships (or villages) in the region have not yet implemented land reform, and are preparing to carry it out successively in the summer, autumn, and winter of this year.

    The East China land reform movement gradually unfolded from November of last year, and has now lasted about half a year. This movement covers a very wide area and is very large in scale. In addition to the old liberated areas of Shandong and northern Jiangsu carrying out the concluding stages of land reform, the new areas implementing land reform include all the newly liberated areas of northern Jiangsu, the entire area of southern Jiangsu, the entire area of southern Anhui, the entire province of Zhejiang, and parts of Fujian and northern Anhui. Now, the entire areas of northern Jiangsu, southern Jiangsu, and southern Anhui, and most areas of Zhejiang have largely been completed, and efforts are being stepped up to resolve the remaining issues in the distribution of land and property in order to benefit production. As for the work of issuing land certificates at the end of land reform, it is planned to continue to complete it during the production gaps after spring plowing.

    From the end of last year to February of this year was the peak period of the East China land reform movement, with the enthusiasm of the farmers being very high, and the struggle between the farmers and the landlord class being intense. At that time, a hasty mood of simply seeking speed was generally produced in various places, and the work was relatively sloppy. In January, the East China Land Reform Committee promptly pointed out this problem, emphasizing that the work must be thorough and meticulous. After that, various places successively organized inspection teams to go deep into the countryside for inspection, and quickly corrected the shortcomings of sloppy work. The inspection team under the South Jiangsu District Land Reform Committee had more than 100 people, who regularly patrolled and inspected in the countryside, which played a great role in the association's ability to grasp the situation, guide the movement, and implement policies. According to the results of inspections in various places, the land reform movement in the vast majority of areas is normal.

    Immediately following the climax of the land reform movement, a broad Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement with great farmer enthusiasm was launched in the rural areas of East China. Through this movement, the political awareness of the farmers was further improved. After the Spring Festival this year, a wave of farmers demanding to join the army to defend their homes and the country was universally launched in East China. With the arrival of spring plowing, the broad masses of farmers actively launched a great production movement. Now, the emancipated farmers in various parts of East China have successively established rural patriotic pacts and patriotic production increase plans.

　　华东土地改革进入结束阶段
　  广大农村掀起抗美援朝和大生产运动
    华东各省、各行政区的土地改革运动已大体进入结束阶段，热情积极的农民正涌入春耕生产运动。截至四月上旬，华东全区已有三万三千多个乡（或村），或已全部完成了土地改革，发了土地证，或已完成土地分配的工作。现在全区只有九千多个乡（或村）还未实行土地改革，准备在今年夏、秋和冬季陆续进行。
    华东土地改革运动从去年十一月逐渐展开，到现在历时已约半年。这次运动地区很广，规模很大。除山东、苏北老解放区进行结束土地改革的地区以外，新区实行土地改革的包括苏北全部新解放地区，苏南全区，皖南全区，浙江全省和福建、皖北部分地区。现在，苏北、苏南、皖南全部地区，浙江大部地区，均已大体完成，正加紧解决分配土地财产工作中遗留的问题，以利生产。至于结束土地改革发土地证的工作，预备在春耕以后的生产空隙中继续完成。
    去年年底到今年二月，是华东各地土地改革运动全面展开，农民热情很高，农民与地主阶级斗争紧张的高潮时期。当时，各地曾普遍产生单纯求快的急躁情绪，工作比较草率。一月，华东土地改革委员会及时指出这个问题，强调工作须深入细致，以后各地就先后组织了检查队，深入乡村检查，迅速纠正了工作草率的缺点。苏南区土地改革委员会所属的检查队有一百多人，经常在农村中巡回检查，对于该会掌握情况，指导运动和贯彻政策，起了很大的作用。据各地检查结果，绝大部分地区的土地改革运动是正常的。
    华东各地农村紧接着土地改革运动的高潮，开展了一个广大农民热情蓬勃的抗美援朝运动。经过这个运动农民的政治觉悟进一步提高。在今年春节以后，华东各地普遍展开了农民要求参军保家卫国的热潮。春耕到来，广大农民又积极展开大生产运动。现在，华东各地的翻身农民已纷纷订立乡村爱国公约和爱国增产计划。
