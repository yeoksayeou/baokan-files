The book and periodical introduction work done by the "Zhejiang Provincial Library Communication," published by the Zhejiang Provincial Library, is commendable. Its first characteristic is its strong political nature, being able to keenly integrate with current affairs policy education to serve readers. It was first published on July 1, 1950, and in the first and second issues (published in July and August), it coordinated with the central political task of opposing American imperialist aggression at the time, publishing the "Record of the Exhibition of Photos of the Chongqing Massacre by the American Imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek Bandits" (an exhibition organized by the library), and "Several Books Clarifying the Ugly Truth of American Imperialism." The third issue in September opened a "Special Topic Index" column, publishing "Reference Materials and Thesis Index on the Issue of American Imperialist Aggression against Taiwan and Korea"; at the same time, in order to cooperate with the propaganda of land reform work, it compiled and published "Reference Materials and Thesis Index on the Land Reform Law." In November 1950, when the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement reached a climax, the journal, in its sixth issue in December, published an editorial entitled "Responding to the Expanded Propaganda of Resisting America and Aiding Korea," and in this issue and the first issue of Volume 2, it continuously published "Reference Books for Resisting America and Aiding Korea" with extensive coverage. The combined second and third issues of Volume 2 published "A Glimpse of the Cultural Relics Plundered from Our Country by American Imperialism," using rich materials to illustrate the situation of American imperialist plunder of our country's cultural relics. Such large-scale and systematic propaganda on Resisting America and Aiding Korea and current affairs policies is of great value.

Its second characteristic is that each issue has a central focus. Its central content is mostly combined with the "Central Book Display" held by the Zhejiang Provincial Library every half month. For example, the library held a central display for Children's Day, a central display of historical science books, a central display commemorating the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, and a central display of the new China's people's literature. It then systematically introduced the books displayed in the journal in installments. Such a method of combining the actual work of the library to help readers select books and understand books is also a good one.

Its third characteristic is that the materials work is done meaningfully. In addition to frequently publishing thesis indexes related to current affairs policies, it also published "Book Review Index" in the first issue of Volume 2, compiling a catalog of theses related to book reviews in various newspapers and periodicals; it is also preparing to compile it for each issue.

The achievements of the "Zhejiang Provincial Library Communication" should be promoted. We also hope that based on the service targets of the library and the journal, it can further deeply combine with actual needs and make the content of book and periodical introductions more extensive. For example, the introduction of patriotic, counter-revolutionary suppression, economic construction, scientific and technological, and popular books are all very important at present. We further hope that library workers across the country will pay attention to the work experience of the Zhejiang Library, pay attention to their work direction and work methods, so that library work has a stronger political nature and takes on a greater propaganda task.

　　《浙江省立图书馆通讯》的书刊介绍工作
    浙江省立图书馆出版的《浙江省立图书馆通讯》所做的书刊介绍工作，是值得称赞的。它的第一个特点就是政治性很强，能敏锐地结合时事政策教育，为读者服务。它是一九五○年七月一日创刊的，在第一期和第二期中（七八两月出版），就配合了当时反对美帝国主义侵略的中心政治任务，发表了《美帝蒋匪重庆大屠杀案照片展览》纪实（该馆组织的展览），“几本明了美帝丑恶真相的书籍”。九月份第三期辟了《专题索引》一栏，发表了《美帝侵略台湾朝鲜问题参考资料及论文索引》；同时为了配合土地改革工作的宣传，编刊了《土地改革法参考资料及论文索引》。一九五○年十一月抗美援朝运动达到高潮，该刊于十二月份的第六期除发表专论《响应抗美援朝的扩大宣传》一文外，并在这一期和二卷一期，连续用大量篇幅发表了《抗美援朝参考书籍》，第二卷二、三期合刊发表了《美帝攫去的我国文物之一斑》，用丰富材料说明美帝国主义掠夺我国文物情况。这样大量地系统地进行抗美援朝和时事政策宣传，是很有价值的。
    它的第二个特点，是每期内容有中心。它的中心内容多半是与浙江省立图书馆每半月举行一次的《图书中心陈列》相结合的，例如该馆举行过儿童节中心陈列、历史科学书籍中心陈列、中国共产党成立纪念中心陈列、新中国的人民文学中心陈列，它便把那些陈列过的书籍在该刊上分期作了系统的介绍。像这样结合图书馆的实际工作，帮助读者选择书籍，了解书籍，也是很好的办法。
    它的第三个特点是资料工作做得有意义。它除了经常发表有关时事政策的论文索引外，在二卷一期还刊载了《图书评介索引》，将各种报刊上有关图书评介的论文编制了目录；它还准备各期编制下去。
    《浙江省立图书馆通讯》的这些成绩是应该推广的，我们还希望能根据该馆该刊的服务对象，更深入结合实际需要，把书刊介绍的内容更广泛一些，如爱国主义的、镇压反革命的、经济建设的、科学技术的、通俗普及的书籍介绍，在目前都是很重要的。我们更希望全国图书馆工作者注意浙江图书馆的工作经验，注意他们的工作方向与工作方法，使图书馆工作有更强烈的政治性，负担起更大的宣传任务。
