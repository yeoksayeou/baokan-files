The nationwide winter clothing donation campaign to support the disaster-stricken people in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Hebei, and Henan provinces has now concluded successfully.

A total of over 6.8 million sets of winter clothing were collected, worth approximately 340 to 350 billion RMB, and were promptly distributed to disaster victims in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Hebei, and Henan provinces. At the same time, it also incidentally solved the winter clothing problem for some urban poor, and helped the suffering people of our fraternal Korean nation. Such a tremendous achievement is unprecedented in China’s history. This fully demonstrates that the Chinese people today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the People's Government, possess inexhaustible strength, and completely shatters the shameless slanders of Acheson, Austin, and their ilk, spokesmen for American imperialism, who claimed that the Chinese people rely on the charity of imperialism. This is also a practical education for the few who in the past fantasized that China's relief efforts could only be carried out with foreign aid.

The success of this winter clothing donation campaign marks a major step forward in the relief and welfare work of New China. We are deeply convinced that in the future, people in relief and welfare circles nationwide, and local people's relief organizations, will certainly be able to summarize this experience, unite even better, and, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, more confidently implement the principle of "self-reliance and helping others," assist the government in organizing the masses to carry out production and thrift, labor mutual aid, so as to promote the development of the people's relief and welfare undertakings.

　　寒衣劝募工作巨大的成就
    全国人民支援皖北、苏北、河北、河南灾民的寒衣劝募运动，现已胜利结束。
    这次共募集寒衣六百八十余万套，约值人民币三千四五百亿元，并已及时地发给了皖北、苏北、河北、河南等地灾民；同时，还附带地解决了一部分城市贫民的寒衣问题，又帮助了朝鲜兄弟国家受难的人民。这样巨大的成就，在中国是史无前例的。这充分地证明：今天中国人民在毛主席和人民政府领导下，有无穷尽的力量。彻底粉碎了美帝国主义代言人艾奇逊、奥斯汀之流，诽谤中国人民要靠帝国主义施舍的无耻谰言。这对于过去那些幻想只有靠外国援助才能办理中国救济事业的少数人们，也是一个实际的教育。
    由于这次寒衣劝募工作的成功，标志着新中国救济福利事业，已大大地向前进了一步。我们深信今后全国救济福利界人士，和各地人民救济团体，必定能够总结这一次的经验，更好地团结起来，在中国共产党和中央人民政府正确领导之下，更有信心地实现“自救助人”的方针，协助政府组织群众进行生产节约，劳动互助，以推进人民大众的救济福利事业的开展。
