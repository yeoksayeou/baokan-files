Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, April 26th: The Panchen Erdeni and the responsible officials of the Panchen Kampus Assembly Hall, a group of fifteen people residing at the Ta'er Monastery in Qinghai Province, departed from Xi'an on the afternoon of the 25th of this month to pay respects to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, in Beijing. Accompanying them was Yang Jingren, a special representative of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, who came specifically to welcome the Panchen.

The Panchen and his entourage arrived in Xining from Ta'er Monastery on the 18th of this month, arrived in Lanzhou on the 19th, and flew to Xi'an from Lanzhou by special plane on the 22nd. During their travels through Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Xining, the Panchen and his party were warmly welcomed and hosted by the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Northwest Military and Political Committee, the Northwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, and the relevant provincial governors and mayors. When the Panchen and his party arrived in and departed from Xi'an, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, Yang Mingxuan, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the same, Ke Zhongping, Deputy Director, Wang Feng, Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Committee, Yang Jingren, Special Representative of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, Ma Mingfang, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government, Ma Hongbin (Hui nationality), Vice Chairman of the Gansu Provincial People's Government, Xirao Jiacuo (Tibetan nationality), Vice Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, Dali Zaya (Mongolian nationality), Chairman of the Alxa Banner Autonomous Region People's Government of Ningxia Province, Fang Zhongru, Mayor of Xi'an, and others personally went to the airport and railway station to welcome and see them off.

On the evening of the 23rd of this month, the Northwest Military and Political Committee held a welcoming banquet to welcome the Panchen and the responsible officials of the Kampus Assembly Hall. In his speech at the meeting, Vice Chairman Xi of the Committee pointed out: Tibet is the Tibet of China, and it is also the Tibet of the Tibetan people. No imperialist robbers must be allowed to invade. Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government have long decided to liberate Tibet, to help Tibetan compatriots return to the embrace of the motherland, to help the Tibetan people develop their own political, economic, cultural, and educational undertakings, and to live a happy and free life like the people of all ethnic groups in China. Now Tibet is about to be liberated, and Tibet is about to return to the big family of the motherland. This is the greatest joy for the Tibetan people and the people of the whole country. The Panchen said at the meeting: Tibet is a part of Chinese territory, and Tibetan territory is Chinese territory. This is recognized by people all over the world. From the previous Panchen to the present, they have consistently been inclined towards the motherland and opposed imperialism, and have consistently struggled to completely eliminate the imperialist forces that invaded Tibet. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government not only did not help them, but also colluded with imperialism to oppress the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the country. Today, the people of all ethnic groups in China have stood up under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Finally, he shouted: Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao! Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
