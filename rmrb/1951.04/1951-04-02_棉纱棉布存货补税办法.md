　　Measures for Supplementary Tax Payment on Cotton Yarn and Cloth Inventory

　　I. These measures are formulated in accordance with Article 5 of the Measures for the Collection of Unified Sales Tax on Cotton Yarn.

　　II. Provincial and municipal tax bureaus should, upon receiving these measures, immediately announce to public and private factories and merchants within their jurisdiction a deadline of five days to register their existing cotton yarn and cotton cloth with the local tax authorities. They should also pay the differential tax on the raw material portion of cotton cloth, calculated at 6% of the unified sales tax rate for cotton yarn, based on the local state-owned China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's listed prices. Cotton yarn less than one piece (forty bundles) and cotton cloth less than one piece (twenty bolts) are exempt from supplementary tax.

　　III. Public and private factories and merchants should complete the registration and supplementary tax payment procedures for their inventory in one go. For those with a large inventory, installment payments may be allowed with the approval of the tax authorities. The installment period should not exceed three months. If there are special difficulties, an extension may be granted, but the maximum extension should not exceed six months.

　　IV. After the supplementary tax is paid on cotton yarn, the "Unified Sales Tax Supplemented" stamp should be affixed to the tax certificate on each piece and across the seams of the package. For newly produced cotton yarn, the words "Unified Sales Tax Paid" should be printed on the package.

　　V. After the supplementary tax is paid on cotton cloth, the "Differential Tax Supplemented" stamp should be affixed across the seams of the package. To facilitate inspection of the market inventory, factories should print "Finished Product Woven with Unified Sales Yarn" on the packages of newly produced cotton cloth before they leave the factory during the supplementary tax period.

　　VI. For cotton yarn and cloth in transit, registration and supplementary tax payment should be made with the local tax authorities after they reach their destination. If they are unloaded and sold midway, registration and supplementary tax payment should be made with the tax authorities at the unloading location.

　　VII. Public and private factories and merchants shall not purchase cotton yarn and cloth that has not been supplemented with tax after the promulgation of these measures.

　　VIII. These measures shall be implemented from April 1st.
