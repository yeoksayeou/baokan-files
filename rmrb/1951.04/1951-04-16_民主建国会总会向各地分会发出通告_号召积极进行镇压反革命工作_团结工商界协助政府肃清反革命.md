　　The All-China Democratic National Construction Association Headquarters Issues a Circular to All Branches
    Calling for Active Suppression of Counter-Revolutionary Work
    Uniting Industrial and Commercial Circles to Assist the Government in Eliminating Counter-Revolutionaries
    [Reported by this newspaper] The All-China Democratic National Construction Association Headquarters' Standing Committee passed the "Circular of the All-China Democratic National Construction Association on Actively Carrying Out the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" at its 30th meeting, calling on branches in various regions to heighten their vigilance against counter-revolutionary elements, intensify their study of documents on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, unite industrial and commercial circles, and assist the government in eliminating counter-revolutionary elements. The full text of the circular is as follows:
    Since the Central People's Government promulgated the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries, a high tide of suppressing counter-revolutionaries has been launched throughout the country, causing reactionary secret agents, spies, habitual bandits, local tyrants, ruffians, leaders of secret societies, and some hidden reactionary elements to be brought to justice one after another. Bandits and secret agents tremble, and the people applaud. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries, land reform, and resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country are the three major tasks at present. We must conscientiously study the document "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries," grasp its spirit, and be able to cooperate with the government in our practical actions to eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements, so as to protect the people's lives and property and consolidate the great cause of the people's democratic dictatorship.
    Regarding the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, a relatively common misunderstanding is complacency. For example:
    Some people think that since the people's revolution has been victorious, counter-revolutionary elements will naturally be tamed. This idea is wrong. Counter-revolutionary elements used to rely on imperialism, feudal forces, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie to exploit the people. They are "irreconcilable" with the people's regime. They are still thinking about "changing the regime" and hoping to make a comeback. Therefore, the more victorious the people are, the more these bad elements hate us, and "they are more determined to adopt more drastic methods of struggle and are more likely to use desperate means of adventure to make a final struggle." The many counter-revolutionary cases that have been uncovered everywhere, including insidious sabotage activities that have never been heard of before, fully prove the truth that the more victorious the people's revolution, the more necessary it is to strengthen the struggle against counter-revolutionaries.
    Some people think that people who show some achievements in their work cannot be saboteurs. This is also a general view. Good work performance is good, but it cannot be said that having a little achievement means that one will never be a counter-revolutionary. "A real saboteur should sometimes make some contributions to his work so that he can maintain his status as a saboteur." Lying dormant to carry out long-term sabotage is originally a common working method of counter-revolutionary elements. We should not be confused by some superficial and temporary phenomena, but should always be vigilant and carefully examine whether people are sincerely working hard for the interests of the people in mass organizations and struggles, or secretly working for counter-revolution, so as to distinguish between real activists and disguised saboteurs. This examination must also be comprehensive, in-depth, and long-term. We must believe that as long as a thorough investigation is carried out, no bandits or secret agents can escape the eyes and ears of the people today.
    Some people think that as long as we devote ourselves to construction and achieve success, the counter-revolutionary attempts will not have any effect. This is a self-intoxicated and paralyzing thought. It should be recognized that only by thoroughly suppressing counter-revolutionary elements and cutting off all the evil hands of imperialism, feudal forces, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie can construction work be carried out smoothly and widely. Any construction work requires the efforts of tens of thousands of people, while sabotage does not require many people. A few bad elements can destroy the cause of tens of thousands of people. We cannot "use loud empty talk to ease the blow against saboteurs."
    Some people think that counter-revolutionary elements no longer have any reserve forces or social foundations. This view is also wrong. The feudal landlords who have been overthrown, the hooligans and local bullies who have yet to be eliminated, the incorrigible warlords and bureaucrats hiding in the cities, the party ruffians and villains of the reactionary government era, and the bandits and secret agents who live by counter-revolution still exist. In addition, the imperialists, especially the U.S. imperialists, are trying every possible means to use these counter-revolutionary forces to cooperate with their aggression against our country, and these counter-revolutionary elements will become more active and蠢动. Therefore, if the remnants of the reactionary ruling class are not completely eliminated or reformed, they are indeed an extremely serious threat to us. We should seriously recognize that even twenty years after the success of the Soviet revolution, a large number of counter-revolutionary traitors instructed by imperialism were still uncovered and punished. As long as the threat and influence of domestic and foreign reactionaries are not eliminated, counter-revolutionary elements may attempt to act, and we will not allow any relaxation in the effort to suppress counter-revolutionaries. We must oppose all fallacies that encourage paralysis towards counter-revolutionary elements. "Only when we eradicate this fallacy can we be completely sure that we are not afraid of any internal traitors or foreign enemies, and we are not afraid of their attacks, because in the future we will crush them as we have done now and in the past."
    Comrades! Now is the time when land reform is being carried out enthusiastically in various places. The lawless landlords, local tyrants, hooligans, local bullies, and habitual bandits who were originally in the countryside can no longer be accommodated in the countryside and have fled to the cities one after another. Sometimes they hide their names and sneak into factories, shops, schools, and institutions to cover themselves. The counter-revolutionary elements who were originally hiding in the cities also want to take advantage of various opportunities to sneak into various air-raid shelters under the iron hammer of suppressing counter-revolutionaries to obtain cover in order to continue their heinous crimes. Whichever place is paralyzed and careless, that place will be chosen by them as an air-raid shelter. Under such circumstances, some counter-revolutionary elements have sneaked into industrial and commercial circles and democratic parties. As far as this association is concerned, many cases of hidden counter-revolutionary elements have also occurred. Therefore, we must be more vigilant, and we must find ways and steps to remove these hidden elements in order to ensure the purity of this association and the safety of industrial and commercial circles. This is a serious political task facing us.
    For this reason, we suggest that local branches, under the leadership of the local government, carry out the following tasks:
    (1) Call on members of this association to launch the study of documents on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries through various groups (see note), and the organization and publicity departments are responsible for organizing reports and checking the effect.
    (2) Encourage members who have participated in reactionary parties, groups, and secret societies to make frank registration, and persuade them to automatically cleanse their history in the spirit of treating illnesses and saving people. If there are individual stubborn people who attempt to conceal the truth, they should be publicly exposed after obtaining the necessary information, and their membership should be expelled. We must do this in order to consolidate our ranks and improve the status and prestige of this association. Otherwise, allowing bad elements to carry out various sabotage activities will inevitably make legitimate industrialists and businessmen hesitate and unwilling to participate in the activities of this association, and even harm the unity among members.
    When carrying out this work, it must also be recognized that the vast majority of members are good, and unity must be strengthened for those who are good. It is imperative not to create a state of "everyone is a suspect," which will affect the consolidation and development of the association.
    (3) Members of this association should immediately assist in organizing and promoting the campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries through the system of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the guilds. It is imperative to launch calls to study documents on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries at various gatherings of industrial and commercial circles, mobilize self-confessions, and organize reporting work, so that all counter-revolutionary elements can be exposed in a timely manner and the government can take appropriate actions.
    (4) The focus of future development of this association should be more clearly affirmed as small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen, especially focusing on those who are regularly engaged in legitimate industry and commerce. Those with counter-revolutionary suspicions and unclear historical backgrounds, even if they have a considerable social status, must not be admitted to the association.
    (5) Of course, the basic policy of this association is development. We cannot close the door in the name of "preventing counter-revolutionary elements from infiltrating." On the contrary, only by absorbing a large number of truly progressive industrialists and businessmen can hidden elements be easily discovered and the back door for counter-revolutionaries to exploit be blocked. We must be good at discovering active members of industry and commerce (such as tax-paying models) in various patriotic movements, strive for and encourage them, be good at establishing close ties with the vast number of industrialists and businessmen, and further promote various movements to complete the glorious task of this association in uniting industrialists and businessmen.
    After receiving this circular, local branches should immediately arrange discussions, promote, check, and summarize various tasks in accordance with the above principles and in combination with the actual local situation, and report the summary to the headquarters before the end of May this year.

　　民主建国会总会向各地分会发出通告
    号召积极进行镇压反革命工作
    团结工商界协助政府肃清反革命
    【本报讯】民主建国会总会常务委员会第三十次会议通过“民主建国会关于积极进行镇压反革命的通告”，号召各地分会提高对反革命分子的警惕，加紧学习镇压反革命文件，团结工商界，协助政府肃清反革命分子。通告原文如下：
    自从中央人民政府颁布惩治反革命条例以后，全国各地掀起了镇压反革命的高潮，使得反动的特务、间谍、惯匪、恶霸、流氓、会门头子和一些暗藏的反动分子，纷纷落网。土匪特务发抖，人民称快，镇压反革命、土地改革、与抗美援朝保家卫国，是当前三大任务。我们必须认真地学习惩治反革命条例这一文件，掌握其精神，而且要能在实际行动中，配合政府肃清一切反革命分子，以保障人民的生命财产，巩固人民民主专政的大业。
    关于镇压反革命这一问题，比较普遍的错误认识，是麻痹大意。例如：
    有些人以为人民革命胜利了，反革命分子自然会驯服起来的。这种想法是不对的。反革命分子过去是依靠帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资产阶级，鱼肉人民为生的。他们对于人民政权，是“不共戴天”的。他们还在想“变天”，希图卷土重来。所以人民愈胜利，这些坏蛋对我们愈加仇恨，“更加决意采用更激烈的斗争方式，更想利用冒险拼命的手段，以作最后的挣扎。”现在各处破获许多反革命案件，内中有闻所未闻的阴险破坏活动，都充分证明了人民革命愈是胜利，愈是需要加强对反革命作斗争的这一真理。
    有些人以为在工作中表现一些成绩的人们，就不会是暗害分子，这也是一种笼统的看法。工作成绩是好的，但不能说有了一点成绩就决不会是反革命。“真正的暗害分子正应该有时也贡献一些工作成绩，他才能保持暗害分子的地位”。潜伏起来进行长期的暗害，本来是反革命分子常用的工作方式。我们不应为一些表面的暂时的现象所迷惑，而应该经常提高警惕，周密细致地考察人们在群众组织中，斗争中是真诚的为着人民利益而努力，或者暗中为着反革命而工作以区别真正的积极分子和伪装的暗害分子。这种考察而且必须是全面的，深入的，长期不断的。必须相信，只要进行彻底的调查，任何土匪特务都不可能逃过今天的人民耳目。
    有些人以为我们只要致力于建设事业获得成功，反革命的企图，就起不了什么作用，这是一种自我陶醉的麻痹思想。应该认识，只有彻底镇压反革命分子，斩断帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资产阶级的一切魔手，才能无阻碍地、广泛地开展建设工作。进行任何建设工作，都需要成千成万的人民的努力，而暗害破坏是不需要多少人的。少数败类，就可以破坏成千成万人民的事业，我们不能“以响亮的空谈，来和缓对暗害分子的打击。”
    有些人以为反革命分子，已经没有什么后备力量，没有什么社会基础了。这一看法，也是错误的。方被打倒的封建地主，尚待肃清的流氓地痞，隐藏都市的怙恶不悛的军阀官僚，反动政府时代的党痞恶棍，和以反革命为生的土匪、特务，仍然存在。加以帝国主义者，特别是美帝国主义者，正在千方百计地来利用这些反革命势力配合它对我国的侵略，这些反革命分子便要更加活跃蠢动起来。所以反动统治阶级的残渣，如果不被彻底地消灭或改造，对我们的确是极其严重的威胁。我们应严肃地认识，苏联在革命成功二十年以后，仍然破获和惩治了一大批帝国主义所指使的反革命的叛徒。国内外反动派的威胁和影响一天未被肃清，反革命分子就有可能企图活动，我们也就一天都不容许松弛镇压反革命的努力。我们要反对一切助长对反革命分子麻痹的谬论，“只有当我们铲除这种谬论时，我们便可以完全有把握的说，我们不怕任何内奸外敌，我们不怕他们袭击，因为今后也将与现在和过去一样粉碎他们”。
    同志们！现在正当各地热烈进行土地改革的时候，原来在乡村中的不法地主、恶霸、流氓、地痞、惯匪，在乡村中已经无法容身，纷纷逃到都市里来。他们有时隐姓埋名，钻进工厂、商店、学校、机关来掩护自己。原来隐藏在都市的反革命分子，在镇压反革命的铁锤之下，也想利用各种机会，钻到各种不同的防空洞里去，取得掩蔽，以继续他们的罪恶滔天的勾当。那个地方麻痹大意，那个地方就会被他们选作防空洞。就在这种情况下，工商界和民主党派，已经被反革命分子钻进了一些进去。就本会而论，也发生了多起的反革命暗藏分子的案子。所以，我们不能不有更高度的警惕，我们必须把这些暗藏分子，有办法有步骤地清除出去，以保证本会的纯洁和工商界的安全。这是我们当前的一个严重的政治任务。
    为此我们建议各地分会，应该在当地政府的领导下，进行下列各项工作：
    （１）号召本会会员，经过各小组展开对镇压反革命文件的学习（见附注），并由组织、宣教部门负责组织报告，检查效果。
    （２）鼓励曾经参加过反动党团会门的会员，进行坦白登记，应该以治病救人的精神，说服他们自动清洗自己的历史。如有个别顽固企图隐瞒者，应在取得必要的资料以后，进行公开揭发，并开除其会籍。我们必须这样做，才能巩固我们的队伍，才能提高本会的地位与威信。否则听任坏分子作种种的破坏活动，就必然会使正当工商业者徘徊观望，而不愿参加本会的活动，甚且损害会员之间的团结。
    在进行这一工作时，还必须认定绝大多数会员是好的，对于好的必须加强团结。切不可造成“草木皆兵”的状态，反而会影响到会的巩固与发展。
    （３）本会会员，应即通过工商联合会、同业公会的系统、协助组织推动展开镇压反革命的运动。必须在各种工商界的集会中，发起号召学习镇压反革命的文件，动员自行坦白，组织检举工作，使一切反革命分子，能够及时的暴露出来，政府得以进行适当的处理。
    （４）本会今后发展的重点，应该更明确地肯定为中小工商业者，尤其着重于经常从事于正当工商业的人员。对于有反革命嫌疑与不明历史底细的人物，即令在社会上有相当的地位，也不得吸收入会。
    （５）当然本会的基本方针是发展的。我们不能借口“防止反革命分子混入”而关起门来。相反的只有大批的吸收真正进步的工商业者进来，才能使隐藏的分子，易于被发现，才能堵塞反革命钻空子的后门。我们必须在各种爱国运动中，善于发现工商业者的积极分子（如缴税模范），加以争取和鼓励，善于与广大工商业者建立密切的联系，更进一步地推动各项运动，以完成本会团结工商业者的光荣任务。
    各地分会接到此项通告后，应即根据上述原则，结合当地实际情况，布置讨论、推动、检查总结各项工作，并请将总结于今年五月底以前，报告总会。
