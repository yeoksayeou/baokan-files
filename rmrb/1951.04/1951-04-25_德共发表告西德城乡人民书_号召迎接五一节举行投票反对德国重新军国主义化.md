    Calling for a May Day Vote Against German Remilitarization
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 23rd] According to TASS, Berlin, 22nd: The Central Bureau of the German Communist Party, in view of the upcoming May Day, has issued a letter to the people of West Germany's cities and countryside, calling on all West German workers, members of all parties and non-party individuals, and trade union members to unanimously express their determination to fight for peace and to demand a popular vote against German remilitarization and for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951. The letter declares: "Millions of people have already responded to the declaration of the Essen Congress against remilitarization, and have established committees in states, districts, cities and villages, and in various enterprises, to demand a popular vote against German remilitarization and for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951. This is in accordance with the interests of all the German people." The letter points out that preparing for the popular vote should be the slogan for this year's May Day celebration. Now, united action by all workers is more necessary than ever before, because the united strength of the working class is the best guarantee against remilitarization and war.

　　德共发表告西德城乡人民书
    号召迎接五一节举行投票反对德国重新军国主义化
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十二日讯：德国共产党中央局鉴于五一节即将来临，特发表告西德城乡人民书，号召全体西德工人们、各党派及无党派人士和工会会员们，一致表示他们为和平而斗争的决心，要求举行反对德国重新军国主义化和争取在一九五一年内缔结对德和约的人民投票。告人民书宣称：“几百万的人民已经响应反对重新军国主义化的埃森代表大会的宣言，在各州、区、城市和乡村中以及各企业中建立了要求举行反对德国重新军国主义化及争取在一九五一年内缔结对德和约的人民投票委员会，这是符合全体德国人民的利益的。”告人民书指出，筹备人民投票应该是今年庆祝五一节的口号。现在，全体工人的一致行动比以前任何时候都更有必要了，因为工人阶级力量的联合是反对重新军国主义化和战争的最好的保证。
