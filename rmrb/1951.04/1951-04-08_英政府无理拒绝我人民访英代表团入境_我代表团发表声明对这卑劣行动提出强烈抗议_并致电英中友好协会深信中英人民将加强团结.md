　　(Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 7th) The Chinese People's Delegation to Britain, invited to attend the annual meeting of the Britain-China Friendship Association in London from April 7th to 8th, was unjustifiably refused entry by the British government. The delegation hosted a press conference in Prague on the 7th, issuing a statement strongly protesting this despicable action by the British government, which deliberately undermines the friendship of the British people towards the Chinese people. At the same time, a telegram was sent to Mr. Jack Dribbon, Secretary-General of the Britain-China Friendship Association. The full text of the delegation's statement is as follows:
　　The Britain-China Friendship Association has scheduled its annual conference to be held in London on April 7th and 8th and had invited people's organizations of the People's Republic of China to send a delegation to participate. At the invitation of the Britain-China Friendship Association, people's organizations of the People's Republic of China sent the Chinese People's Delegation to Britain, composed of Li Yimang, Qian Duansheng, Wang Tieya, Cao Richang, and Yang Chengfang, to Britain to participate. On March 19th, the delegation applied to the British government for entry visas. After repeated inquiries, the British government officially replied on April 4th, refusing the entry of the entire delegation by refusing entry to a portion of the delegation members. In this way, the British government once again used the old trick of refusing entry to the delegates to the Second World Peace Congress held in Sheffield, England, last November, attempting to despicably obstruct friendly exchanges between the Chinese and British people. This only shows that the British government is extremely fearful of the friendship between the Chinese and British people, and therefore has to resort to such unreasonable means to undermine it. The Chinese people feel very indignant at this shameless and unreasonable measure of refusing entry to the Chinese People's Delegation to Britain. The Chinese people are deeply convinced that the friendship between the Chinese and British people cannot be obstructed or undermined by such despicable means, and that the Chinese and British people will unite more closely and strive to defend lasting world peace.
　　The telegram to Mr. Dribbon, Secretary-General of the Britain-China Friendship Association, is as follows: Mr. Dribbon, Secretary-General of the Britain-China Friendship Association, London:
　　We regret to inform you that, regarding our visit to Britain to participate in your annual conference, after a delay of seventeen days, the British government officially notified us on April 4th that it would grant entry visas to some of us, but refused visas to others. This makes it impossible for us to attend your conference.
　　This extremely tyrannical and unreasonable action by the British government is clearly intended to prevent us from meeting the British people and to undermine the friendship between the Chinese and British people. This is because the British government is extremely fearful of the development and consolidation of the friendship between our two peoples, which is a major factor in the struggle against wars of aggression and for the maintenance of lasting world peace.
　　Although we are unable to attend your annual conference, we know that the friendship between our two peoples will never be affected by such despicable and shameless obstruction by the British government. On the contrary, the British government's tyrannical and clumsy measures will only further expose its own ugly face. We are deeply convinced that the Chinese and British people will strengthen unity and strive together against wars of aggression and for the maintenance of lasting world peace. We wish the Britain-China Friendship Association annual conference a success.
　　　　Head of the Chinese People's Delegation to Britain, Li Yimang

　　英政府无理拒绝我人民访英代表团入境
　  我代表团发表声明对这卑劣行动提出强烈抗议
　  并致电英中友好协会深信中英人民将加强团结
    【本报讯】据新华社布拉格七日电：被邀出席于四月七日至八日在伦敦举行的英中友好协会年会的中国人民访英代表团，竟被英国政府无理拒绝入境。该团七日在布拉格招待记者，发表声明，对英国政府这种蓄意破坏英国人民对中国人民的友谊的卑劣行动，提出强烈的抗议。同时，并致电英中友好协会秘书长杰克·德里邦先生。该团声明原文如次：
    英国英中友好协会订于四月七、八两日在伦敦举行周年大会，并曾电邀中华人民共和国人民团体派遣代表团参加。中华人民共和国人民团体应英中友好协会之请，派遣了由李一氓、钱端升、王铁崖、曹日昌及杨承芳等五人所组成的中国人民访英代表团赴英参加。代表团于三月十九日即向英国政府交涉入境签证，经过多次催询，英国政府始于四月四日正式答复，用拒绝访英代表团一部分代表入境的形式，拒绝了整个访英代表团的入境。这样，英国政府又一次延用了去年十一月他们拒绝在英国设菲尔德召开的第二届世界拥护和平大会的代表们进入英国的故技，企图卑鄙地阻挠中英两国人民友谊的交往。这只是说明了英国政府对中英两国人民的友谊极其恐惧，因而不得不采用这种极其无理的手段来予以破坏。中国人民对于这种无耻无理地拒绝中国人民访英代表团进入英国的措施，感到十分愤懑。中国人民深信，中英两国人民的友谊断非这种卑劣手段所能阻挠和破坏，中英两国人民将更加团结起来，为保卫世界持久和平而奋斗。
    致英中友好协会秘书长德里邦电如次：伦敦英中友好协会秘书长德里邦先生：
    我们十分遗憾地通知你，关于我们来英参加你们的周年大会问题，经过十七天的拖延之后，英国政府在四月四日才正式通知我们，给我们一部分人入境签证，而拒绝给另一部分人签证。这就使得我们不能来参加你们的这次大会。
    英国政府这种极端横暴而无理的手段，显然是有意阻挠我们前来和英国人民见面，有意破坏中英两国人民的友谊。因为英国政府是十分恐惧我们两国人民友谊的发展与巩固的，这种友谊是反对侵略战争维护世界持久和平斗争中的一个重大因素。
    我们虽然不能来参加你们这次年会，但是我们深知，我们两国人民的友谊，绝不会因为英国政府这种卑鄙无耻的阻挠而受到影响。恰恰相反，英国政府的这种横暴拙劣的措施，只会更加暴露他自己的丑恶面目。我们深信，中英两国人民将加强团结，为反对侵略战争及维护世界持久和平而共同奋斗。敬祝英中友好协会年会成功。
        中国人民访英代表团团长李一氓
