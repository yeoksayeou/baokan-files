  Suggestions for More Explanations and Introductions When Screening Soviet Films Such as "The Conspiracy"

    Editor:
    Recently, several very educational Soviet films have been shown, such as "The Fall of Berlin," "Secret Mission," and "The Conspiracy." Some of our comrades were very moved after watching them. However, some—a considerable number—of comrades felt that they did not quite understand some of the content because these films reflect many historical and world political issues. For example, some comrades who watched "The Conspiracy" felt that they did not really understand the specific situation of the "Social Democratic Party." These comrades are always very interested in Soviet films, so this considerably weakened the educational effect of these good films. I think this is a pity. I suggest that whenever such films are shown, the relevant departments, such as the Film Bureau, should make some popular explanations and interpretations of the content in newspapers, on the radio, and during the public screening of the films. They should explain some of the names, place names, and other terms in the films that are unfamiliar to the general audience, in order to attract more viewers and strengthen the educational role of these films.

    Editor's Note: The opinions raised by the two readers above are very good. It is hoped that the relevant parties in cinemas and theaters, such as the Film Bureau, the Film Management Company, and the Theater Management Committee, will pay attention to this, actively improve the management of cinemas and theaters, and strengthen the education work for the audience.

### 建议放映《阴谋》等苏联电影时要多作说明介绍工作

  　建议放映《阴谋》等苏联电影时要多作说明介绍工作
    编辑同志：
    最近放映了几个极有教育意义的苏联电影，像《攻克柏林》、《秘密使节》、《阴谋》等。我们的一些同志们看了以后，非常感动。但也有一些——相当多的一些——同志觉得其中有一部分的内容看不大懂，原因是这些片子反映了不少历史问题和世界政治问题。例如有些同志看了《阴谋》一片，觉得“社会民主党”的具体情况实在不了解，而这些同志对苏联电影一向又是很有兴趣的，这样就相当削弱了这些好影片的教育作用。我认为这是可惜的事。我建议：凡是演出这类片子的时候，有关部门如电影局等，应该在报纸上，在广播电台上，在片子公映期间，对内容作一些通俗的说明和解释，对片子中的一些为一般观众所认为生疏的人名、地名及其他名词等，作一些解释，以便争取更多的观众，加强这些影片的教育作用。
          阿丛
    编者按：上面两位读者所提的意见是很好的，希望电影院、剧场的有关方面如电影局、影片经理公司及剧场管理委员会加以注意，积极地改进影剧院的管理，加强对观众的教育工作。
