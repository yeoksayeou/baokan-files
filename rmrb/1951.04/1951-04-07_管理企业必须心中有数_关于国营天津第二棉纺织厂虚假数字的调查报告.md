　　Managing Enterprises Requires Being Mindful
　  ——An Investigation Report on False Figures at the State-Owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory
    Our Newspaper Reporter Lu Hao
    The state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory (hereinafter referred to as Factory No. 2) under the North China Textile Administration Bureau, has done a lot of beneficial work in the initial transformation of old enterprises for more than two years. In particular, it has cracked down on and reformed a group of bad elements who bullied workers, abolished the old system of oppressing workers, and cultivated and promoted a large number of outstanding elements from the working masses to take up leadership positions in enterprise management. This has improved the political consciousness of all employees and mobilized and organized large-scale production competitions, which has achieved great results.
    But what is the biggest difficulty for Factory No. 2 in implementing the economic accounting system now? It is the problem of "not being mindful" in enterprise operation and management. "Not being mindful" is specifically manifested in the fact that the factory's leading comrades do not know, or do not fully know, the actual situation of the factory's raw materials, production efficiency, and output. This problem has been sharply exposed in the recent exposure of false production figures by the workers and staff of Factory No. 2. This exposure is a concrete manifestation of the growing sense of ownership of all employees of Factory No. 2 in enterprise management. This is beneficial to improving their own awareness, improving the work of Factory No. 2, and even improving the leadership of the national textile industry.
    In Factory No. 2, exactly how much raw cotton is needed to spin a bale of yarn is a confused account. Taking the overall cotton consumption figure (Note 1) for December 1950 as an example: According to the original records of this month, the amount of cotton consumed per bale of yarn (Note 2), including 31 catties of waste (Note 3), was 392.02 catties. According to the business standard calculation, each bale of yarn weighs 363 catties net, and the waste should be more than 36 catties, requiring about 400 catties of cotton to produce a bale of yarn. It is very obvious that there are problems with the original records of raw cotton receipt and payment and the workshop. However, in order to conform to the so-called "standard," Factory No. 2 reported the figure of 401.13 catties per bale of yarn to the North China Textile Administration Bureau. In this way, the amount of cotton consumed per bale of yarn is 9.11 catties higher than the original record of 392.02 catties. Based on the number of bales of yarn produced this month, this would mean an extra 60,000 catties of cotton. However, in reality, this surplus cotton figure does not exist, and the North China Cotton Textile Administration Bureau has not looked for the reason for this surplus figure. Therefore, no one actually knows how much cotton is consumed per bale of yarn in Factory No. 2.
    If the overall consumption cannot determine the amount of cotton consumed per bale of yarn, the situation of separate consumption (Note 4) is the same. In Factory No. 2, it is also unclear how much cotton is consumed for various yarn counts (Note 5). According to the original record statistics of the factory's cotton consumption for various yarn counts in February this year, it is as follows:
    Count 　　　　 20s 　　　　　　21s 　　　　 22s
    Cotton Consumption (catties) 392.63 　　 404.18 　　 379.52
    According to the actual situation, the cotton consumption of yarns with similar counts should not differ too much. There is no doubt that the above statistics must be due to errors in the original supply records. However, Factory No. 2 did not fundamentally analyze the reason for this problem in detail. In order to make the cotton consumption of each yarn count "reasonable" and at the same time meet the standards required by the higher authorities, Factory No. 2 reported the following figures to the North China Textile Administration Bureau:
    Count 　　　　 20s 　　　　　　21s 　　　　 22s
    Cotton Consumption (catties) 399.89 　　 400.01 　　 400.22
    It can be seen that in Factory No. 2, inventory becomes a flexible place to adjust cotton consumption. If there is too much or too little raw cotton, inventory (Note 6) is used to adjust it. The result of confusing counts (Note 7) is either reducing the quality of the yarn or increasing the cost of the yarn, and the cotton consumption figures for each yarn count are difficult to accurately calculate. This makes the cost accounting work completely empty, makes production quotas lose their basis, and in particular makes enterprise operation and management unable to closely see where savings have been made and where waste has occurred. False figures mask the loopholes in enterprise management, and mislead the direction of production leadership.
    In Factory No. 2, how much yarn can actually be produced per day? What is the working efficiency of each spindle per hour? This is also a confused account. Taking the figures reported by the factory to the North China Textile Administration Bureau in December 1950 as an example: In that month, due to the excessively low calculation of the hank conversion rate (Note 8), which was exactly the opposite of the aforementioned surplus raw cotton situation, the reported figure of yarn production in the yarn mill was 33,641 catties less than the actual inventory deficit. This deficit was later made up in January. In the market, because the hank conversion rate of self-use yarn was calculated too high, the actual yarn received by the cloth mill was less than the amount delivered by the yarn mill. This invisibly reduced the cost of the yarn mill, and the cost of the cloth mill was additionally increased. Therefore, the amount of yarn used per piece of cloth in that month was as high as 11.08 pounds, exceeding the previous standard yarn consumption of 10.79 pounds by 9.74 percent. It was not good to report the excessive yarn consumption, so the yarn consumption per piece of cloth was reduced to 10.894 pounds. The 20,915 pounds of deficit due to the reduced yarn consumption standard was used as inventory for the cloth mill. In fact, this yarn did not exist, but was rolled over month by month, making the cloth mill a place to flex the yarn production.
    The total output calculation is inaccurate, and the output calculation per spindle per hour is also inaccurate. Taking the actual output of the factory's No. 2 spinning mill on January 30 this year as an example:
    Count   Units Actual Spindles Hank Conversion Rate Converted Pounds Output per Spindle per Hour (Pounds)
    22s     37   14288        96.5%             5421          0.0495
    In order to make up for the aforementioned yarn production deficit in December last year, Factory No. 2 used the method of lowering the hank conversion rate to make up for it. Therefore, the hank conversion rate was lowered to 95 percent. However, due to the decrease in the hank conversion rate, the output per spindle per hour also decreased to 0.0487 pounds. It was also very "ugly" to reduce the output per spindle per hour for production performance. Therefore, they came up with a way to underreport the operating rate (Note 9). As a result, the reported output figures for the same day were falsely created as follows:
    Count   Falsely Reported Units Falsely Reported Spindles Falsely Reported Hank Conversion Rate Falsely Reported Pounds Falsely Reported Output per Spindle per Hour (Pounds)
    22s     36   13904        95%             5337          0.0501
    It can be seen that to make the yarn output more or less, as long as the hank conversion rate is flexibly adjusted, the spindles that are running can also be written as stopped due to flat cars or cleaning cars (Note 10). This makes the production figures lose their true record, makes the factory's production performance a matter of estimation by a few technicians, and in particular makes the creative enthusiasm of the workers and staff cannot be fully expressed, and correct criticism and commendation cannot be carried out.
    From the materials recently revealed by the employees of Factory No. 2, the reasons for the false production figures can be seen: Due to some corrupt management systems that are common in bureaucratic enterprises, they have not been thoroughly and effectively reformed, or the reform is very slow. In addition, the leadership lacks experience in enterprise operation and management, and there is a certain degree of bureaucracy. This makes it impossible for the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers and staff to be fully developed, hindering the continued improvement of enterprise operation and management. Some administrative management personnel unilaterally focus on how the higher authorities require production figure standards and how other factories' production records are. As a result, they have relaxed their fighting will. For example, in Factory No. 2, how much coal is used to generate one kilowatt-hour of electricity? Instead of seeking true records according to correct methods, they first inquire about the coal consumption figures of other factories, determine the coal consumption figure per kilowatt-hour according to subjective wishes, and then there is another formula for calculating coal consumption in Factory No. 2. This formula is: total coal consumption - (fabricated coal consumption per kilowatt-hour × total power generation) - steam coal consumption = coal consumption per kilowatt-hour. In fact, the workers and staff of the original motivation department are working hard. They inspect and repair boilers and transform gate valves. In the past, they used 170 tons of coal per day, but now they use only about 120 tons of coal per day. The actual coal consumption has indeed decreased. However, due to the lack of actual statistics, it is impossible to know how high the labor creation of the workers and staff has reached. It should be emphasized that the false production figures cannot obliterate the great contribution of all employees of Factory No. 2 to national construction in the past two years. Taking the output of the old cloth factory as an example, the output of cloth in the winter of 1950 increased by 11.47 percent compared with the spring of 1949 at the beginning of the liberation of Tianjin. There are many such facts; but precisely because the production figures have the problem of falsehood, it is impossible to fully express the actual production enthusiasm of all employees of Factory No. 2.
    Another reason for the false production figures is that the statistical work has the problem of formalism. Taking the planning section of Factory No. 2 as an example, there are a total of 108 kinds of reports made by the section, and only 13 kinds are relatively true, and the other 95 kinds are untrue. One of the important reasons for the untruthfulness is that the original records of the lower-level statistical work are extremely inaccurate. In the workshop, the consumption of raw materials and the calculation of output are not the responsibility of the main statistical personnel. The hanks are copied by the oilers, the records of machine downtime are registered by the secretaries, and the cloth output figures are done by the cloth wipers, but their main job is to do other work. Therefore, statistical work is only an incidental job. This situation must be improved. Secondly, the lack of unified calculation in statistical work also causes the inconsistency of figures before and after statistics. For example, the planning section and the personnel section both make worker attendance reports, but because the calculations are different, the number of people attending work each day is different. For example, on March 20, the personnel section counted the number of spinning workers in the cloth mill as 2,599, and the planning section counted it as 2,567. The two sides differed by 32 people. These problems also make the statistical work lack accurate basis, and the result is inevitably reduced to a formality.
    Replace the phenomenon of being mindful of nothing with scientific mastery of production figures; strictly implement the responsibility system, organize workers and staff to supervise each other, and completely eliminate the perfunctory and irresponsible work attitude left over from the old enterprise; simplify reports and strengthen the work of original records to establish the basis for correct production figure statistics. This is the first step that Factory No. 2 must take to implement the economic accounting system.
        Tianjin, March 24
    Note 1: This is the overall consumption of various counts of yarn as 20s yarn.
    Note 2: That is, the amount of cotton used per bale of yarn.
    Note 3: Refers to cotton lint, dust, broken seeds, etc.
    Note 4: The amount of cotton used for various counts of yarn.
    Note 5: Yarn is divided into 20s, 21s, 22s, etc. For example, 20s means that one pound of yarn has 20 units of 840 yards long; 21s means that one pound of yarn has 21 units of 840 yards long, and so on.
    Note 6: That is, the statistics of raw materials and semi-finished products at the end of the month.
    Note 7: This situation occurs when the supply of semi-finished products is chaotic during the production process. For example, cotton sliver for making 21s yarn is used as 22s yarn; or cotton sliver for 22s yarn is used as 21s yarn.
    Note 8: Hank is the unit for calculating yarn production, one hank is 840 yards. However, due to twist shrinkage, broken ends, empty spindles, etc., the actual output cannot be exactly the same as the figure calculated by the hank meter on the car. For example, if 1,000 hanks of yarn are produced, if the conversion rate is 95%, then 1,000 hanks are converted into 950 hanks for calculation. Therefore, raising or lowering the hank conversion rate can make the yarn output change accordingly.
    Note 9: The ratio of the number of actual running spindles to the number of original spindles.
    Note 10: Flat car refers to the disassembly and repair work of the machine; cleaning car refers to the cleaning and inspection work of the machine.

　　管理企业必须心中有数
　  ——关于国营天津第二棉纺织厂虚假数字的调查报告
    本报记者　陆灏
    华北纺织管理局国营天津第二棉纺织厂（以下简称二厂），两年多以来在初步改造旧企业的工作上，做了很多有益的工作。特别是打击和改造了一批欺侮工人的坏分子，取消了压迫工人的旧制度，培养和提拔了大批工人群众中的优秀分子担任了企业管理的领导工作，从而提高了全厂职工的政治觉悟，发动与组织了大规模的生产竞赛，获得了很大的成绩。
    但要推行经济核算制，目前二厂最大的困难是什么呢？是企业经营管理工作上“心中无数”的问题。“心中无数”具体表现在厂的领导同志，不知道，或者是不完全知道本厂原材料、生产效率和产量的确实情况。这一问题，从最近二厂自职工群众中开始揭发虚假生产数字的事实中尖锐的暴露出来。这种暴露，是二厂全体职工在企业管理上主人翁感觉日益增强的具体表现，这对于提高自己的觉悟，改进二厂的工作，乃至提高全国纺织工业的领导上，都是有益的。
    在二厂，究竟确实需要多少原棉能扯一件纱，这是一笔糊涂账。以一九五零年十二月份的通扯（注一）数字为例：据本月份原始记录，每件纱的扯棉量（注二），包括三十一斤下脚（注三）在内，共用棉三九二·○二斤。若依经营标准计算，每件纱净重为三百六十三斤，下脚则应在三十六斤以上，约需四百斤棉花才能出一件纱。十分显然，这是原棉收付和车间的原始纪录发生了问题。但是，由于为了所谓合乎“标准”，二厂便将每件纱扯棉以四○一·一三斤的数字报到华北纺织管理局。如此，每件纱的扯棉量比原始纪录三九二·○二斤的数字高九·一一斤，按本月产纱件数计算，就多出棉花六万斤；但实际上此项棉花盘盈的数字并不存在，而华北棉纺织管理局对于此项剩余的数字也并未寻找原因。所以二厂的扯棉量究竟是多少，实际上是无人能够知道的。
    通扯不能知道每件纱的扯棉量，分扯（注四）的情况也是如此。在二厂，各种支数纱（注五）的扯棉量究竟是多少，也是不清楚的。据今年二月该厂各支数纱的扯棉量之原始纪录统计如下：支别  　　　　  二十支    　　　　二十一支 　　　　 二十二支扯棉量（斤）    三九二·六三     四○四·一八     三七九·五二
    按照实际的情况，支数相近的纱支，扯棉量不会相差太大。毫无疑问，上述统计一定是供应的原始纪录发生了错误；但二厂并未从根本上去详细分析这一问题发生的原因，为了使得各支数纱扯棉量的“合理”，而同时又都能合乎上级要求的标准，二厂向华北纺织管理局又报了下例数字：支别    　　　　二十支  　　 　　 二十一支 　　　　二十二支扯棉量（斤）    三九九·八九    四○○·○一     四○○·二二
    由此可见，在二厂，盘存就成为调整扯棉量的机动之地，原棉多了或者少了，就用盘存（注六）来调剂。混乱支数（注七）的结果，不是降低了纱的质量；就是提高了纱的成本，各支数纱的扯棉量数字也就难以正确统计。这就使计算成本的工作完全落空；使生产定额失去依据；特别是使企业经营管理不能严密地看到在什么地方进行了节省，在什么地方发生了浪费，虚假的数字粉饰了企业管理上的漏洞，使生产的领导迷失了方向。
    在二厂，究竟每日能确实生产多少纱？每一个纱锭，每小时的工作效率又是怎样？这也是一笔糊涂账。仍以一九五零年十二月该厂向华北纺织管理局上报的数字为例：该月份由于亨司折合率（注八）的计算过低，和前述盈余原棉的情况恰恰相反，纱场纱的产量的上报数字比实际盘存亏空三万三千六百四十一斤，这笔亏空的数字后来是在一月份内补足的；在市场，由于将自用纱的亨司折合率计算过高，于是布场收到的纱实际少于纱场交付的数字，这样就使纱场的成本无形中减低；而布场的成本额外提高，因而该月份布场每匹布的用纱高到一一·○八磅，超过以往标准用纱一○·七九磅的百分之九·七四。用纱过高是并不好上报的，于是又把每匹布的用纱降至一○·八九四磅，其因降低用纱标准亏空的二万零九百十五磅的数字就作为布场的盘存，实际上这笔纱又并不存在，只是逐月下滚，将布场作为纱的产量伸缩的地方就是了。
    总的产量计算是不确实的，每小时每个纱锭的产量计算也是不确实的。举今年一月三十日该厂第二纺纱场的实际产量情况为例：支别   　 台数  实开锭数  亨司折合率  折磅  每锭每小时产量（磅）二十二  三七  一四二八八 百分之九六·五  五四二一  ○·○四九五
    为了弥补前述去年十二月份产纱亏空的数字，二厂就以降低亨司折合率的办法来弥补，于是就把亨司折合率降至百分之九十五，但由于降低亨司折合率，同时每个纱锭每小时的产量也随着下降至○·○四八七磅，降低纱锭每小时的产量对于生产成绩又很“难看”，于是又从少报运转率（注九）上想办法，结果同日产量数字上报假造为以下情况：支别    假报台数  假报锭数  假报亨司折合率  假报折磅  假报每锭每
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　小时产量（磅）二十二   三六  一三九○四  百分之九五   五三三七  ○·○五○一
    由此可见，要使纱的产量多或少，只要灵活调整亨司折合率，也可以把正在运转的纱锭，写成它因为平车、擦车（注十）而停开。这就使生产数字失去了真实的纪录；使全厂的生产成绩成为少数技术人员凭眼光估计的事情；特别是使职工群众的创造热情不能得到充分表现，正确的批评和表扬也无法进行。
    造成生产数字虚假的原因，从二厂最近职工揭露的材料中可看出：由于一部分在官僚主义企业中习以为常的腐朽的管理制度，还未得到彻底的有效的改革，或者改革得很慢，加上领导上对企业经营管理缺乏经验，以及一定程度的官僚主义作风，这就使得职工群众的积极性与创造性不能得到充分的发扬，障碍着企业经营管理的继续改进。有一部分行政管理人员片面地贯注在上级对于生产数字的标准要求如何和别厂的生产纪录如何，因而松懈了自己的战斗意志。譬如在二厂究竟发一度电，要用多少煤，他们不是按照正确的方法求取真实的纪录，他们却是先打听别厂煤耗的数字，按着主观的愿望，然后再定出每度电的煤耗数字，因而二厂就有另外一个计算煤耗的公式。这一公式是：总用煤量—（假造每度电的耗煤量×总发电量）—蒸汽耗煤量＝每度电煤耗量实际上，原动部门的职工群众是努力的，他们检，修锅炉，改造闸板，过去每天用煤一百七十吨，现在每天用煤不过一百二十吨左右，实际用煤确已减少，但由于缺乏实际的统计，就无法知道职工群众的劳动创造到底达到了怎样的高度。应该着重指出：生产数字的虚假决不能抹煞两年以来二厂全体职工对于国家建设的伟大贡献。以老布厂的产量来说，一九五零年冬季比天津解放初期的一九四九年春天，布的产量提高了百分之十一·四七。这样的事实是很多的；但正由于生产数字发生了虚假的毛病，就无法完全表达二厂全体职工群众实际的生产热情。
    生产数字虚假的另一个原因，是统计工作有着形式主义的毛病。就以二厂计划科来说，该科制作的表报共有一百零八种，比较真实的仅有十三种，其他九十五种都是不真实的。不真实的重要原因之一，就是下层统计工作的原始纪录极不精确。车间里原材料的耗用和产量的计算，都没有人员主要的负责统计，抄亨司是加油工抄的，机器停开的纪录是书记工登记的，布的产量数字是揩布工作的，但他们更主要的是做别的工作，因而统计工作只是一种附带的工作，这种情况必须加以改善；其次是统计工作缺乏统一的计算，也造成数字统计前后不符的原因，如计划科和人事科，都作工人出勤报告表，但由于计算不一样，每天出勤的人数就各有差异，如三月二十日，布场运转工的出勤人数统计人事科统计为二千五百九十九人，计划科统计为二千五百六十七人，双方相差三十二人。这些问题，也使统计工作缺乏精确的依据，其结果是无可避免地流于形式。
    以科学的掌握生产数字代替心中无数的现象；厉行责任制，组织职工群众相互监督，完全扫除旧企业残留的敷衍塞责的工作态度；简化表报，加强原始纪录的工作，以建立正确生产数字统计的基础。这就是二厂实行正确生产情况的纪录，改进企业经营的领导，从而鼓舞全厂职工群众的劳动热情的三个相互衔接的环节，这就是二厂实行经济核算制要走的第一步。
        三月二十四日于天津
    注一：这里是将各支纱通扯为廿支纱。
    注二：即每件纱的用棉量。
    注三：指棉屑，尘土、破籽等物。
    注四：各支纱的用棉量。
    注五：纱分廿支、廿一支、廿二支等种。如廿支，即一磅纱有廿个八百四十码长；廿一支，即一磅纱有廿一个八百四十码长，余则类推。
    注六：即月终对于原材料和半制品的统计。
    注七：此种情况是在生产过程中半成品的供应混乱时发生。如把制造廿一支纱的棉条作廿二支用；或把廿二支纱的棉条作廿一支用。
    注八：亨司是计算产纱的单位，一亨司为八四○码。但因捻缩、断头、空锭等原因，故实际产量与车上亨司表计算的数字不能完全一样。例如产纱一千亨司，如折合率为百分之九十五，即一千亨司折成九百五十亨司计算。因此，升降亨司折合率，可使纱的产量随之变动。
    注九：实际运转细纱锭数与原有锭数之比。
    注十：平车是对机器进行拆修工作；擦车是对机器进行清洁检查工作。
