The All-China Democratic Women's Federation
Instructions on Popularizing and Deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement Among Women
To all levels of Democratic Women's Federations, Chinese Women's Associations, Chinese Young Women's Christian Associations, and Chinese Women's Temperance Associations:

In order to earnestly implement the March 14th notice of the China People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, and to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement nationwide, and to publicize and respond to the call of the World Peace Council, all levels of Democratic Women's Federations and member organizations must attach great importance to popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement among women. Every woman in every place must receive patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea, eliminate the ideological influence of imperialism remaining among women, and stimulate patriotic enthusiasm. Everyone should work hard in production, work, and study, and educate their children to love the motherland, using this practical action to support Korea and oppose the American aggressors, so that the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement can be truly popularized and deepened among all the people.

Around the "March 8th" International Women's Day this year, Democratic Women's Federations and member organizations in various places carried out varying degrees of patriotic propaganda and education on resisting America and aiding Korea among women, expanding the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in women's circles. According to incomplete statistics, from January to "March 8th" International Women's Day, more than 6.3 million women in more than 180 cities and towns across the country participated in demonstrations and parades against America and against American imperialism rearming Japan. Many of them were housewives who rarely participated in social and political activities, and even nuns and sisters began to participate, expanding the unity of women's circles. Moreover, a large number of women participated in patriotic practical actions. Many patriotic mothers and wives personally sent their children and husbands to join the Volunteer Army. Many patriotic women personally went to work on the front lines, or sewed military uniforms and shoes for the soldiers on the front lines in the rear, and donated comfort bags, comfort items, and comfort money, etc. An even larger number of women are actively engaged in production, work, and study in various positions, assisting the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, consolidating the people's regime, and supporting the Korean front. However, the movement is not widespread and deep enough. Because some local cadres underestimated the enthusiasm of women for resisting America and aiding Korea and failed to mobilize them fully, many urban women and the vast majority of rural women have not yet been educated. At the same time, due to some shortcomings in the work, such as some cadres treating the work of resisting America and aiding Korea as a temporary task without fully integrating it with regular work; or adopting administrative orders without fully improving women's understanding from a political perspective; or failing to adequately address women's ideological situation, simply talking about grand principles, resulting in little effect. Therefore, among the women who have already received education on resisting America and aiding Korea, some have not yet been deeply educated. Although some women have begun to clarify pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American thoughts, it is not solid enough.

In order to further popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement among women, and to promote the women's liberation cause in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, the following suggestions are hereby put forward to you:

(1) We must regard popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement among women as the central task and fully implement it. From now until the "May 1st" Labor Day, the focus of carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement should be placed on popularization. The Democratic Women's Federation should prepare to cooperate with local Resist America, Aid Korea branches, trade unions, and relevant organizations to mobilize female workers, working women, and women from all walks of life to participate in the "May 1st" demonstrations and parades, ensuring that the women participating in the parades account for about one-third to one-half of the total number of adult women. In particular, more attention should be paid to mobilizing women who rarely participate in social and political activities to participate. To this end, various small mobilization meetings should be held in advance. At these meetings, and in accordance with the April 5th notice of the China People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, signatures should be collected in support of the World Peace Council's declaration on concluding a peace treaty, and votes should be held on the Japanese issue, that is, voting against the United States arming Japan, against the United States unilaterally concluding a peace treaty with Japan, and advocating the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. Attention should be paid to popularizing patriotic covenants; those that have not been established should be established immediately, and those that have been established should be implemented. At the same time, when arranging parades and demonstrations, the physical strength of women should be appropriately taken into account. Elderly and weak women can participate in short-distance parades. For children, appropriate arrangements should be made so that mothers can participate in the parades with peace of mind. The method of setting up temporary childcare stations in some cities during the "March 8th" International Women's Day parade is good and can be promoted.

After the "May 1st" Labor Day, the work during this period should be reviewed, and the ideological and practical work of the women should be further understood, experiences should be summarized, and new work steps should be decided. Generally speaking, for women who have already received propaganda and education, the focus should be on deepening; for those who have not yet received propaganda and education, popularization should continue first, and then deepened. It is required that every woman in every place should receive in-depth patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea and participate in specific patriotic actions this year.

To this end, Democratic Women's Federations and member organizations at all levels should combine the regular work tasks of women, take care of women's special circumstances, formulate a plan for popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement among women this year, and make the greatest efforts to implement it.

(2) In order to achieve the above objectives, Democratic Women's Federations and member organizations at all levels should organize all possible forces to the greatest extent possible. For women in all walks of life, they must actively consult with mass organizations, youth, and student organizations in all walks of life, as well as other organs and organizations that include women, to assist them in formulating plans and methods for popularizing and deepening the work of resisting America and aiding Korea that include women and are suitable for women; and they must provide timely suggestions, materials, and experiences to assist relevant organizations in conducting education on resisting America and aiding Korea for women in their respective industries.

Urban Democratic Women's Federations themselves should vigorously carry out work among housewives, women in religious circles, and other unorganized women. Housewives account for more than half of the urban women and have fewer opportunities to participate in social and political activities. Women in religious circles are more deeply influenced by imperialist ideology. Therefore, Democratic Women's Federations in various cities must pay attention to working among them. Only in this way can every woman in every place be educated, and the goal of uniting all patriotic and democratic women can be achieved. In rural areas, the Democratic Women's Federation should actively cooperate with peasant associations, the New Democratic Youth League, cooperatives, people's schools, mutual aid teams, etc., to actively popularize and deepen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea among rural women.

To this end, emphasis should be placed on organizing female cadres, activists among women, women representatives, female propagandists, female teachers, female artists, and female intellectuals in families; they should first be given short-term training to familiarize them with the ideological situation, current level, and understanding of the content of propaganda, propaganda methods, and then through them, the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement should be carried out among women. In addition, the Democratic Women's Federation can also mobilize women from all walks of life to publicize to their families and relatives, and promote men and college and middle school students from all walks of life to publicize to their families. Some cities have already adopted this method when commemorating the "March 8th" Festival and have achieved significant results. We believe that as long as the Democratic Women's Federations in various places are good at organizing and using various forces, they will surely be able to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement among all women.

(3) The content of the propaganda: It must be based on the development of the current international and domestic political situation, the specific local work tasks, and the tasks of women's work (such as currently mobilizing women in rural areas to participate in spring plowing and production, mobilizing female workers in factories to participate more actively in patriotic production competitions, and preparing for the June 1st International Children's Day, etc.), to determine the content of propaganda and education for each period. At present, it should be linked to responding to the resolutions of the World Peace Council and the International Democratic Women's Federation Council, especially to oppose American imperialism rearming Japan, oppose American imperialism unilaterally concluding a peace treaty with Japan, and combine it with the current work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries to assist the government in eliminating American Chiang Kai-shek special agents.

(4) Propaganda methods: Past experience has proved that holding various small meetings to accuse the crimes of American imperialism, Japanese invaders, and their running dogs Chiang Kai-shek bandits and special agents, and using real people and real events familiar to the masses to clearly explain the principles of resisting America and aiding Korea to protect the home and defend the country is the most effective method. In addition, various methods such as regular lectures, broadcasts, slides, and especially various artistic propaganda can be adopted. Now, many Democratic Women's Federations have set up women's publications, and many Democratic Women's Federations have also established women's supplements in local newspapers, which can become our regular propaganda positions. When there is strength, some popular pamphlets and picture books can be published to provide propaganda materials. We should also contact various relevant propaganda organs, pay attention to compiling propaganda materials suitable for women to read, and absorb women to participate in various meetings, evening parties, and movie and opera performances with propaganda and educational significance.

(5) Attention should be paid to carrying out propaganda and education through the original women's organizations, especially women's representative conferences, to arrange work and exchange work experience, and at the same time, through propaganda and education, to universally establish, expand, and consolidate women's organizations.

(6) In order to complete the above tasks, the Democratic Women's Federations in various places, under the unified leadership of the local Resist America, Aid Korea branches, should work together to implement the policy of mobilizing both men and women, and universally and deeply carry out the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement among both men and women. A work plan including women should be formulated, and male and female cadres should work together, arrange together, and check together. The cadres of the Democratic Women's Federation themselves should actively and diligently study current events, earnestly improve their policy level, and come out of the narrow small circles and bureaucratism to become the backbone of promoting the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in women's circles. Responsible cadres should also be sent to the affiliated Democratic Women's Federations in a timely manner to guide and promote work.

(7) This association has previously notified that a propaganda and education work conference will be held in June this year to summarize the experience of the Resist America, Aid Korea work in women's circles, discuss the plan and methods for popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement among women in the future, and stipulate the business and institutions of the propaganda and education department that are adapted to this and can be realized. To this end, we hope that the Democratic Women's Federations of major administrative regions, provinces, Beijing, and Tianjin, the Democratic Women's Federations of cities directly under the major administrative regions, and the member organizations affiliated to this association will submit the first report on the plan for resisting America and aiding Korea, the actual situation of implementation, and the experience to us before the end of May to assist in the preparation work for the propaganda and education work conference. Thereafter, written reports should be submitted to us on a quarterly basis.

### 中华全国民主妇女联合会  关于在妇女群众中普及和深入抗美援朝运动的指示

　　中华全国民主妇女联合会
    关于在妇女群众中普及和深入抗美援朝运动的指示各地各级民主妇女联合会中国妇女联谊会，中华基督教女青年协会，中华妇女节制协会：
    为了切实执行中国人民抗美援朝总会三月十四日的通知，在全国普及和深入抗美援朝运动，宣传并响应世界和平理事会的号召，各级民主妇女联合会及会员团体必须十分重视在妇女群众中普及深入抗美援朝运动，真正做到每一处每一个妇女都受到抗美援朝的爱国主义教育，肃清帝国主义在妇女群众中残留的思想影响，激发爱国主义热情，大家努力生产，努力工作，努力学习，并教育儿女热爱祖国，以此种实际行动，支援朝鲜，反对美国侵略者，使抗美援朝运动真正普及和深入到全体人民中去。
    今年“三八”国际妇女节前后，各地民主妇女联合会及会员团体都在妇女群众中进行了不同程度的抗美援朝的爱国主义的宣传教育工作，扩大了妇女界的抗美援朝运动。据不完全的统计，从一月到“三八”国际妇女节，全国一百八十几个城市和乡镇，共有六百三十多万妇女参加了抗美援朝反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的示威游行，其中有很多是平时很少参加社会政治活动的家庭妇女，甚至尼姑修女也开始参加，扩大了妇女界的团结，而且有大批妇女参加了爱国实际行动，有不少的爱国的母亲和妻子亲送了自己的子女、丈夫参加志愿军，有不少爱国的妇女亲自上前线工作，或在后方替前线将士缝制军衣军鞋，捐献慰劳袋慰劳品慰劳金等等。更有大批妇女正在从各种不同的岗位上，积极生产、工作和学习，协助政府镇压反革命，巩固人民政权，支援朝鲜前线。但是运动还不够普遍和深入，由于有些地方的干部，对妇女群众的抗美援朝的热情估计不足，未能放手发动，至今尚有不少的城市妇女和绝大多数农村妇女没有受到教育。同时又由于工作中的一些缺点，如有些干部或者以抗美援朝工作当做临时性的任务，没有充分与经常工作结合；或者采取行政命令的方式，未能充分从政治上来提高妇女的认识；或者未能很好地针对妇女的思想情况，空讲大道理，收效微小，因此在已经受到抗美援朝教育的妇女中，也有一部分尚未能受到深入的教育。有些妇女虽已开始澄清亲美、崇美、恐美思想，但不够巩固。
    为了进一步在妇女群众中普及深入抗美援朝运动，并在抗美援朝中推进妇女解放事业，特向你们提出下列建议：
    （一）要把在妇女群众中普及和深入抗美援朝运动当作中心的工作，全力贯彻执行。从现在开始，到“五一”节以前，开展抗美援朝运动的重点放在普及方面，民主妇女联合会准备配合当地抗美援朝分会、工会、及有关团体发动女工、劳动妇女及各界妇女参加“五一”示威游行，保证参加游行的妇女能占成年妇女总人数的三分之一到二分之一左右，特别应更多的注意动员平时很少参加社会政治活动的妇女参加。为此，事先应召开各种小型的动员会议，在这些会议上，并应根据中国人民抗美援朝总会的四月五日的通知，举行拥护世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言上签名，举行日本问题的投票，即投票反对美国武装日本，反对美国单独对日媾和，主张签订全面的对日和约，注意普及爱国公约，没有订立的应即订立，已经订立的要贯彻执行，同时在布置游行示威时，应适当地照顾妇女的体力，年老体弱的妇女可参加短途游行，对于小孩，应给以适当的安置，使母亲们安心参加游行。“三八”国际妇女节游行时，有些城市设临时托儿站的办法是好的，可以推广。
    在“五一”节以后，应检查这一时期的工作，更进一步了解妇女群众的思想情况和实际工作情况，总结经验，决定新的工作步骤。一般说来，对于已经受过宣传教育的妇女，应着重深入，对尚未受过宣传教育的，应继续普及，然后深入；要求今年年内能达到每一处每一个妇女都受到深入的抗美援朝的爱国主义教育，并参加爱国的具体行动。
    为此，各级妇女联合会及会员团体应结合妇女的经常工作任务，照顾妇女特殊情况，制订出今年在妇女群众中普及和深入抗美援朝运动的计划，并以最大努力来贯彻执行。
    （二）为着达到上述目的，各级民主妇女联合会及会员团体，应尽可能组织一切可能运用的力量，对各行各业妇女，必须主动地和各行各业的群众团体、青年、学生的组织以及其他包含有妇女在内的机关、团体协商，协助他们订出包含妇女在内并适合妇女的普及深入抗美援朝工作的计划及办法；并须适时的提出建议，提供材料和经验，协助各有关的团体，向各该行业的妇女进行抗美援朝的教育。
    城市民主妇女联合会本身应大力在家庭妇女，宗教界妇女及其他没有组织的妇女中间开展工作。家庭妇女占城市妇女半数以上，参加社会政治活动的机会较少，宗教界妇女受帝国主义思想影响较深，因此各城市民主妇女联合会必须注意在她们中工作，只有这样才能使每一处每一个妇女受到教育，才能达到团结全体爱国民主妇女的目的。在农村中，民主妇女联合会应主动配合农民协会、新民主主义青年团、合作社、民校、变工组互助组等，积极在农村妇女中普及和深入抗美援朝工作。
    为此，应着重组织女干部、妇女群众中的积极分子、妇女代表、女宣传员、女教员、女艺人、家庭知识妇女等；对于她们先加以短期的训练，使她们熟悉妇女群众的思想情况，现有水平及了解宣传内容，宣传方法方式，然后通过她们在妇女群众中开展抗美援朝运动。此外民主妇女联合会并可动员各行各业的妇女向她们的家属、亲友宣传，推动各行各业的男子，以及大、中、小学生向他们的家属宣传。有些城市在纪念“三八”节时，已经采用了这种办法，获得了显著成绩，我们相信，只要各地民主妇女联合会善于组织和运用各种力量，一定能够使抗美援朝运动普及和深入到全体妇女中去。
    （三）宣传的内容：必须针对当时的国际、国内政治形势的发展，当地的具体工作任务，妇女工作的任务（如目前农村中发动妇女参加春耕生产，工厂中发动女工更积极地参加爱国主义生产竞赛及筹备六一国际儿童节工作等），定出每一个时期宣传教育的内容。目前应联系响应世界和平理事会及国际民主妇女联合会理事会的决议，特别要反对美帝国主义重新武装日本，反对美帝国主义单独与日本媾和，并结合目前镇压反革命的工作，协助政府肃清美蒋特务。
    （四）宣传的方式方法：过去经验证明普遍召开各种小型的会议，控诉美帝国主义、日寇及其走狗蒋匪特务的罪行，运用群众熟知的真人真事具体讲清楚抗美援朝保家卫国的道理，是最有效的办法。此外并可采取各种各样的方式如定期讲座、广播、幻灯、特别是各种艺术宣传。现在有不少民主妇女联合会举办了妇女刊物，也有不少民主妇女联合会在当地报纸上办了妇女副刊，这些就可以成为我们经常的宣传阵地。有力量时并可出版一些通俗的小册子画刊等等，供给宣传材料。更应与各种有关的宣传机关接洽，注意编写适合于妇女阅读的宣传品，吸收妇女参加各种有宣传教育意义的会议、晚会和看电影戏曲等等。
    （五）应注意通过原有的妇女组织，特别是妇女代表会议来进行宣传教育，布置工作，交流工作经验，同时并经过宣传教育，来普遍建立和扩大巩固妇女的组织。
    （六）为完成上述任务，各地民主妇女联合会要在当地抗美援朝分会统一领导之下，协力贯彻男女一齐发动的方针，在男女群众中一齐普及深入抗美援朝运动，订出包含妇女在内的工作计划，男女干部一起动手，一起布置，一起检查，而民主妇女联合会干部本身更应积极努力学习时事，认真提高政策水平，从狭隘的小圈子里和事务主义中走出来，成为推动妇女界抗美援朝运动的骨干。更应适时地派负责干部到所属民主妇女联合会去指导和推动工作。
    （七）本会前已通知将于今年六月召开宣传教育工作会议，是总结妇女界抗美援朝工作的经验，讨论今后在妇女群众中普及深入抗美援朝的计划和办法，规定与此相适应而又可能实现的宣传教育部门的业务和机构；为此希望各大行政区、各省民主妇女联合会，北京、天津市民主妇女联合会，各大行政区直属市民主妇女联合会及本会所属会员团体，将抗美援朝工作的计划及执行的实际情况及经验，于五月底以前向我们作第一次汇报，协助宣传教育工作会议的准备工作。以后应按季向我们作书面报告。
          中华全国民主妇女联合会  四月十三日
