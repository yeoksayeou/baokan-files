    Why Does the Tianjin Lisheng Sporting Goods Factory Use the "Republic of China" Dating System? Editor:
    In March, we requested a price list from the Tianjin Lisheng Sporting Goods Factory and discovered that the factory's stamp on the list read: "March 12, Fortieth Year of the Republic of China." My classmates found this very strange. The People's Republic of China declared the abolition of the old year numbering system when it was founded in October 1949. Why is the Lisheng factory still using this dating system today? We request that this phenomenon be corrected immediately.

### 天津利生体育用品工厂为何采用“民国”记年法？

专栏：来信摘要

    天津利生体育用品工厂为何采用“民国”记年法？编辑同志：
    我们在三月间向天津利生体育用品工厂要了一份价目表，发现表内有该厂盖的一个长印是：“中华民国四十年三月十二日”。同学们都很奇怪，早在一九四九年十月中华人民共和国成立时，已宣布取消旧年号，利生工厂为什么到今天还用这样的记年？我们要求赶快纠正这种现象。
