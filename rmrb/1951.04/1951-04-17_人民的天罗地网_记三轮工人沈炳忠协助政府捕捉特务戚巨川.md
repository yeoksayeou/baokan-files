    ——An Account of Tricycle Worker Shen Bingzhong Assisting the Government in Capturing Special Agent Qi Juchuan

    At twelve o'clock on the night of March 20th, Shen Bingzhong, a seventeen-year-old tricycle driver, was about to stop work and rest after a day of fatigue. As he entered the Tianqiao West Market Street, he picked up a passenger who said he wanted to go to the outer seventh district government to find a relative. When they arrived at the outer seventh district government, it was already closed. The passenger then asked Shen Bingzhong to take him back to Tianqiao; just as they arrived at Tianqiao, he asked to be taken to Qianmen Railway Station. It was already past two in the morning when they arrived at Qianmen Railway Station. He asked Shen if there were any trains to Tianjin at this time. Shen replied that there were none until dawn. This passenger then discussed with Shen Bingzhong the possibility of Shen taking him around Beijing in the tricycle until dawn for 10,000 yuan. Shen was too tired to continue and did not agree.

    On the way home, Shen Bingzhong kept thinking about this strange passenger. Sometimes he thought the passenger might be a special agent, but then he thought that a cadre in the outer seventh district was a relative of the passenger, so he might not be a special agent.

    Shen Bingzhong had just laid down on his bed, dragging his tired body, when public security personnel from the outer fifth sub-bureau came to find him. The person who came told him, "The higher-ups want us to arrest a special agent who came to Beijing from Ninghe yesterday. The special agent's name is Qi Juchuan, and he is a special agent of the Kuomintang Military统局绥靖纵队第一大队 (Military Statistics Bureau Pacification Column First Brigade). We have been looking for him two or three times without catching him. We heard he took your tricycle?" Upon hearing this, the image of the passenger he had pulled an hour earlier immediately appeared in Shen Bingzhong's mind. He was suddenly startled and said, "He's a special agent? Had I known, I would have caught him long ago; that guy looked scared out of his wits." As he spoke, he got dressed. The public security comrades quickly held him down and said, "You've been tired all day, don't get up. Just tell us where you took him, and we'll go and catch him ourselves." "No, let's go together, I know him better than you, as long as I see him, he's guaranteed not to escape." So, he borrowed a bicycle and led several public security personnel on their way.

    They went to Qianmen Railway Station and searched for a long time without finding the man. Shen Bingzhong said, "This guy might be near the Chongwenmen Huashi Street district government." He then recounted the situation when he took the special agent to the outer seventh district. The public security personnel again advised him to go back to rest, but he insisted on leading the way. So, they left two public security personnel near the station, and Shen Bingzhong led two public security personnel straight to the outer seventh district government. They separately lay in ambush near the outer seventh district government.

    It was almost six o'clock when the sun had just turned red. At this time, a patrolman from the outer seventh district brought out a suspicious-looking person from an alley. Shen Bingzhong immediately recognized that it was the special agent Qi Juchuan they were trying to capture. He quickly called out to the two public security personnel, "We caught him! This is the guy, no mistake about it."

    After the special agent was arrested, Shen Bingzhong did not immediately go home. He ran to Qianmen Railway Station to notify the other two public security personnel. At the time, he thought: there are few of us, if we draw another public security person to the station to call people, I am afraid that there will be problems on the way back.

    Shen Bingzhong's active assistance to the government in arresting special agents was not accidental, nor was it simply because he was a restless young man, but rather because hatred for special agents had been planted in his young heart when he was twelve or thirteen years old. Shen Bingzhong is from Tongxian County. In his hometown, he was once labeled by Kuomintang special agents as a "little scout for the Eighth Route Army." Several special agents caught him, beat him severely, and threatened to beat him to death. Later, he escaped. In March 1948, his father was arrested by special agent Li Xinfeng on the grounds that selling cigarettes at a high price proved he was ideologically unsound. Later, through connections, a table of food was used as a fine, and the whole family, men, women, old and young, did hard labor for the Kuomintang special agents, and the matter was considered over. Every time he thought of these hatreds, he gnashed his teeth and was filled with indignation.

    When he assisted the government in capturing the special agent and returned home, it was already time for his daily work. He was so excited that he no longer felt any physical fatigue. He happily pushed out his tricycle and began his day's work.

    ——记三轮工人沈炳忠协助政府捕捉特务戚巨川
    朱波
    三月二十日夜十二时，十七岁的三轮车夫沈炳忠，带着一天的疲劳要收车休息了。当他刚刚走进天桥西市场大街时，拉上了一个据说要到外七区区政府找一个亲戚的客人。当拉到外七区政府时，区政府已经关了门。他又要沈炳忠拉他回天桥；刚到天桥，又要拉他到前门车站。到前门车站时已是深夜两点多钟。他问沈现在还有没有到天津去的火车？沈回答说没有了，到天明时才有。这个客人又和沈炳忠商量，要沈拉着他在北京市内转，转到天明给一万元。沈因为太疲劳，实在支持不住，没有答应他。
    在回家的路上，沈炳忠老在想着这个莫名其妙的客人。有时想到这个客人可能是特务，但又想到外七区有个干部是这个客人的亲戚，又不一定是特务。
    沈炳忠拖着疲倦的身体刚刚躺在床上，有外五分局的公安人员找他来了。来人告诉他说：“上级要我们逮捕一个特务，是昨天从宁河跑来北京的。特务名叫戚巨川，是国民党军统局绥靖纵队第一大队的特务。我们找了两三次没有捉住他，听说他坐过你的车？”沈炳忠一听，脑海中马上出现了在一个钟头前所拉过的那个客人的影子，他突然一惊，说：“他是特务？要知道我早把他捉住了；那家伙像吓坏了似的。”说着就穿衣服起来。公安局同志忙按住他说：“你累了一天，不要起来了，你说拉到什么地方，我们自己去捉。”“不，咱们一块去，我比你们更熟悉他，只要见了，保险跑不了。”于是，他借了一辆自行车，领着几个公安人员出发了。
    他们到前门车站，找了半天没有找到那人。沈炳忠说：“这家伙可能在崇文门花市大街区政府附近。”他又把当时他拉特务到外七区的情形说了一遍。公安人员这时又劝他回去休息，他还是坚持着要领着去。于是，留下两个公安人员仍在车站附近，由沈炳忠领着两个公安人员直奔外七区政府而去。他们分头在外七区区政府附近埋伏着。
    将近六点钟的时候，太阳刚露红。这时候，外七分区的巡逻警察，从一条胡同里带出来一个形迹可疑的人，沈炳忠马上认出来就是要捕的那个特务戚巨川。他连忙招呼那两个公安人员：“捉住了！就是这家伙，一点都错不了。”
    把特务分子逮捕住了，但是沈炳忠并没有马上回家，他又跑到前门车站，通知另外的两个公安人员。当时他是这样想：自己的人少，如果再抽一个公安人员到车站叫人，恐怕向回解的途中发生问题。
    沈炳忠积极帮助政府逮捕特务不是偶然的，更不是因为他是青年人好动，而是从他十二、三岁的时候，在他幼小的心灵里已种下了对特务的仇恨。沈炳忠是通县人。在故乡，他曾被国民党特务指为“八路军的小探子”。几个特务捉住他，暴打了他一顿，声言还要打死他。后来他跑了出来。一九四八年三月，他父亲又被特务李心丰抓了起来，理由是卖纸烟卖得贵，证明思想不良。后来托了人情，罚了一桌饭，全家男女老幼又给国民党特务做了苦工，事情才算过去。每想到这些仇恨，他都是咬牙切齿，愤不堪言的。
    当他协助政府捕捉了特务回到家的时候，已是他每天出车的时间了，他兴奋得再也感觉不到身体的疲劳。他愉快地推出三轮车，又开始了他一天的劳动。
