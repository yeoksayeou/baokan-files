Workers at the Wuchang Power Plant of the E'nan Electric Power Company, a clothing factory in Hankou, a leather factory, Wufeng Flour Mill, and the Jiang'an Railway Factory, Jiang'an Inspection Section, and Locomotive Depot affiliated with the Zhengzhou Railway Administration's Hankou Branch are all preparing to welcome their holiday with new achievements of completing the entire month's production tasks three to five days ahead of schedule. In addition to guaranteeing the completion of the entire month's tasks six days ahead of schedule, workers in the B Inspection Group and C Inspection Group of the Jiang'an Inspection Section will also repair five severely damaged carriages as a gift for "May 1st" Labor Day. After exceeding the first quarter's production target by 20%, Zhu Chengchun's team at the Hubei Provincial Farm Implement Factory has already formulated a specific plan to strive to complete the April production task five days ahead of schedule. Currently, all workers in the team are intensifying production. Workers and amateur artists from various factories are rushing to make slogans, cartoons, and various charts to display the gradually increasing production figures of the workers of their respective factories and to introduce the deeds of model workers for the "May 1st" parade. The Wuchang Branch of the Hengyang Railway Administration has dispatched two propaganda vehicles to various stations along the line to promote and advance the preparations for the "May 1st" parade and demonstration. At present, colorful archways with portraits of Chairman Mao are being erected on major streets and at the entrances of many factories throughout the city. Clerks in various public and private stores are also tidying up and arranging shop windows to welcome "May 1st." Some stores have also hung up song sheets of songs to be sung during the "May 1st" parade in the shop windows, allowing pedestrians and customers to view and sing along. In recent days, after nightfall, the songs of "Resist America, Aid Korea" and "Oppose the American Armed Japan" and the sound of waist drum practice are everywhere.

　　武汉工人保证提前完成任务
    武汉市工人正以加紧生产的实际行动迎接“五一”国际劳动节，并积极筹备“五一”示威大游行。鄂南电力公司武昌发电厂、汉口某被服厂、某皮革厂、五丰面粉厂和郑州铁路管理局汉口分局所属江岸铁路工厂、江岸检车段、机务段等单位的工人都准备以提前三天至五天完成全月生产任务的新成绩来迎接自己的节日。江岸检车段乙检组和丙检组工人，除保证提前六天完成全月任务外，还要修好五辆破坏不堪的车厢，做为“五一”劳动节的献礼。湖北省农具制造厂朱成春小组，于超额百分之二十完成了第一季度的生产任务后，即已订出具体计划，争取提前五天完成四月份的生产任务，现全组工人正加紧生产中。各工厂工人和业余文艺工作者们，正在赶制“五一”游行时用以显示各该厂工人生产数字逐步上升和介绍劳动模范事迹的标语牌、漫画牌及各种图表。衡阳铁路管理局武昌分局并已出动了两台宣传车到沿线各站宣传和推动“五一”游行示威的准备工作。现全市各重要街道和许多工厂门口正在搭起五彩缤纷的悬有毛主席肖像的大牌楼。各公私营商店店员也正在整顿和布置橱窗，迎接“五一”。有的商店并把“五一”游行时要唱的歌片挂在橱窗内，让行人和顾客观唱。连日来入夜以后，到处都飘荡着“抗美援朝”、“反对美国武装日本”的歌声和练习腰鼓的鼓声。
