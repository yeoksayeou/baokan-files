Remember This New Blood Debt

    American imperialist planes have recently been constantly intruding into our Northeast airspace, carrying out indiscriminate bombing. On March 30th, 31st, and April 7th alone, American invading planes intruded into Antung, Kuandian, Linjiang, Ji'an, and other areas of our country more than 20 times, using up to 80 planes, dropping more than 100 bombs, causing much loss to the lives and property of our people. The Chinese people must firmly remember this blood debt and will one day demand repayment from the enemy.
    The continuous bombing and strafing of our Northeast by American invading planes is an act of expanding the war. But this bloody atrocity will not only fail to save the American aggressors from defeat on the Korean battlefield, but will only further strengthen the Chinese people's determination and will to resist America and aid Korea. From this, the Chinese people have come to a deeper understanding of the enemy's brutality and weakness, because it refuses to admit defeat on the battlefield and so brutally massacres our peaceful people. From the very first day that the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, the Chinese people have clearly realized that the enemy's main purpose is to attack China. Now, we have drawn another conclusion from real life: only by resolutely fighting the enemy to the end and helping the Korean people defeat the American aggressors can we guarantee our peaceful and happy life.

　　记住这又一笔血债
    美国帝国主义的飞机近日又不断地侵入我东北领空，滥施轰炸。计上月三十日、三十一日和本月七日三天，美国侵朝飞机侵入我国的安东、宽甸、临江、辑安等地二十多次，使用飞机达八十架，投弹百枚以上，使我人民生命财产遭受许多损失。这一笔又一笔的血债，中国人民一定要把它牢牢地记在心头，总有一天要向敌人索还。
    美国侵朝飞机的连续轰炸和扫射我国东北，是一种扩大战争的行为。但这种血腥的暴行，不但不能挽救美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上失败，而且只有更加坚定中国人民抗美援朝的决心和意志。中国人民从这里更进一步地认识到敌人的残暴和虚弱，因为它既不肯承认战场上的失败，而又如此残暴地屠杀我国和平人民。中国人民从美国发动侵朝战争的第一天，就清楚地意识到：敌人的主要目的是在进攻中国。现在，我们又从实际生活中得出一个结论：只有坚决地与敌人斗争到底，协助朝鲜人民打败美国侵略者，才能保障自己和平幸福的生活。
