　　Introducing the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Propaganda Responsibility System in Beijing's Fifth District
　　Lin Hong
    Beijing's Fifth District, in its efforts to popularize the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and to welcome the "May Day" demonstration parade, has adopted a "contract system," that is, the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea propaganda responsibility system. The advantage of this method is that tasks are clear, responsibilities are fixed, and it is easy to stimulate the enthusiasm of propaganda workers; if it is not done well, it is also easy to trace responsibility.
    The specific approach of the responsibility system adopted by the district is: The overall leadership of the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea propaganda work is the responsibility of the Beijing Fifth District Committee of the Communist Party of China (hereinafter referred to as the District Committee). Four district-level working groups were established below to be responsible for propaganda and education work for residents, workers, office staff, and students and teachers, respectively. According to these four systems, anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea committees or propaganda groups were established at all levels from top to bottom to be responsible for the propaganda and education work of each police station, street, industry, factory, and school. Each level of propaganda agency formulates its own plan, which is implemented after approval by the superior organization. In order to discover and correct the shortcomings or deviations in the propaganda and education work in a timely manner, the district also decided that the party branches of the departments participating in the propaganda work should play a guaranteeing role, and the organization department of the district committee is responsible for checking and supervising the propaganda and education work of each unit.
    The district's current popular Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea propaganda and education plan was formulated based on the specific conditions of the district. The district has more than 130,000 people, of which unorganized residents account for the largest number, about 97,000. In the past four months, the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea propaganda and education work has been done relatively well in larger state-owned factories, public schools, and some private schools, but a large number of unorganized residents, religious circles, private middle schools (especially church schools), primary schools, and scattered shop assistants, handicraft workers, and porters, many people have not received this kind of education at all, or have only heard one or two current affairs reports, or have only seen one or two dramas or pictures related to Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea. Many muddled ideas still exist among these people. In response to this situation, the district committee determined that the current focus of the entire district's popular Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea education should be to conduct propaganda among unorganized residents; the focus of propaganda in schools should be private middle schools and primary schools, and special attention should be paid to strengthening propaganda and education for church schools and religious circles; the focus among workers should be shop assistants and scattered handicraft workers. According to this plan, the division of labor of the four working groups at the district level is: The Communist Party's district committee secretary, district head, district cultural and education section chief, industry and commerce section chief, Democratic Women's Federation, and China-Soviet Friendship Association personnel are jointly responsible for leading the propaganda and education work for residents; the Communist Party's district committee propaganda minister, some personnel from the district committee organization department, and the district Communist Youth League secretary are jointly responsible for leading the propaganda and education work for schools and religious circles; the district trade union office is responsible for leading the propaganda and education work for workers; the district committee propaganda department and organization department are responsible for leading the propaganda and education work for office staff. For factories, schools, or other units where the Communist Party of China and the Communist Youth League branches are of better quality and the masses have a higher political awareness, the district working group only makes general arrangements, and they are responsible for it themselves, and then check the work through regular reports and symposiums. In this way, the district working group can concentrate its efforts on attacking the weakest links.
    The propaganda responsibility system adopted by the district is not handled by a few people, but to organize the activists among the residents and, under the leadership of the district-level cadres, jointly be responsible for the propaganda and education work of the police station or street. This will ensure that patriotic education for Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea is popularized to unorganized residents. Each police station is composed of a district cadre, representatives of the district people's congress from all walks of life, as well as the director of the Democratic Women's Federation, members of the China-Soviet Friendship Association, health committee members, cooperative representatives, representatives of revolutionary martyrs' families, heads of night schools, and fire prevention captains of each police station to form an Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea committee, which is responsible for the propaganda and education work within its jurisdiction. Under the police station, propaganda groups are formed according to the streets, with street representatives, fire prevention and hygiene team leaders, etc., from 70 to 100 households; each group is responsible for the propaganda of these dozens of households. The cadres of the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea committee of each police station and the members of the street groups must undergo short-term study before conducting propaganda in each household. This team, jointly composed of cadres and activists from all walks of life, is the main force of the district's popular Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea education. In addition, the district committee also decided to transfer 4,200 middle school students and some university students to each police station to assist in promoting propaganda work, publish blackboard newspapers, teach singing, hold forums, and visit door to door, focusing on propaganda for working people and housewives. After primary school teachers improve their political awareness through study, they also mainly conduct propaganda to students' parents.
    At present, Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea committees have been established in all 18 police stations in the district, and the district committee secretary has made a mobilization report to more than 900 district and street representatives, fire prevention and hygiene team leaders, etc. The working method adopted by the district of establishing organizations at all levels, dividing responsibilities, and absorbing and utilizing activists is worth promoting.

　　介绍北京市第五区的抗美援朝宣传专责制
　　林洪
    北京市第五区在普及抗美援朝运动、迎接“五一”示威游行的宣传教育工作中，采用了“包干制”，亦即抗美援朝宣传专责制的方法。这种方法的好处是任务明确，责任固定，容易发挥宣传工作人员的积极性；如果作得不好，也容易追查责任。
    该区采用的专责制的具体作法是：抗美援朝宣传工作的总的领导由中国共产党北京市第五区委员会（以下简称区委会）负责，下面成立四个区一级的工作组，分别负责对居民、工人、机关工作人员和学生、教师、进行宣传教育工作。再按这四个系统，从上到下成立各级的抗美援朝委员会或宣传小组，负责各派出所、街道、行业、工厂和学校的宣传教育工作。每一级的宣传机构都各自订出计划，经上级组织批准后执行。为了及时发现和纠正宣传教育工作中的缺点或偏向，该区又决定参加宣传工作的各部门的党支部要起保证作用，并由区委会组织部负责检查和督促各单位的宣传教育工作。
    该区这次普及抗美援朝的宣传教育计划，是根据本区的具体情况制订的。该区有十三万多人，其中以无组织的居民占最大多数，约九万七千多人。在过去四个月来，抗美援朝的宣传教育工作，在较大的公营工厂、公立学校和部分私立学校中做得比较好，但广大的无组织的居民、宗教界、私立中学（特别是教会学校）、小学以及居住分散的店员、手工业工人和搬运工人等，有许多人还根本没有受到这种教育，或者只听过一两次时事报告，或者只看过一两次有关抗美援朝的戏剧、图片，这些人还存在许多糊涂思想。该区区委会针对这种情况，确定当前全区在普及抗美援朝教育时应注意对无组织的居民进行宣传；在学校中进行宣传的重点是私立中学和小学，特别要加强对教会学校与宗教界的宣传教育；在工人中的重点是店员和分散的手工业工人。根据这个计划，区一级四个工作组的分工是：共产党的区委会书记、区长、区文教科长、工商科长、民主妇女联合会和中苏友好协会人员共同负责领导对居民的宣传教育工作；共产党的区委会宣传部长，区委会组织部部分人员和区青年团书记共同负责领导对学校和宗教界的宣传教育工作；区工会办事处负责领导工人的宣传教育工作；区委会宣传部和组织部负责领导机关工作人员的宣传教育工作。凡是中国共产党和中国新民主主义青年团支部质量较好、群众政治觉悟较高的工厂、学校或其他单位，区工作组只作一般布置，由他们自己包干负责，然后通过定期汇报和座谈会来检查工作。这样区工作组就可以集中力量突击最弱的环节。
    该区所采用的宣传专责制并不是由少数人包办，而是要把居民中的积极分子组织起来，在区各级干部的领导下，共同负责本派出所或街道的宣传教育工作。这样就可以保证把抗美援朝的爱国教育普及到无组织的居民中去。各派出所都是由一个区干部、区各界人民代表会议代表及各该派出所的民主妇女联合会主任、中苏友好协会委员、卫生委员、合作社代表、革命军人家属代表、夜校负责人和防火大队长等共同组成抗美援朝委员会，负责本所辖区内的宣传教育工作。在派出所下面，又按街道，将七十到一百户中的街代表、防火和卫生组长等，组成若干宣传小组；每一小组包作这几十户的宣传。各派出所抗美援朝委员会的干部和街道小组的成员，都要经过短期学习后，才到各户进行宣传。这一支由干部和各界群众中的积极分子共同组成的队伍，是该区普及抗美援朝教育的主力军。此外，区委会还决定抽调四千二百个中学生和部分大学生，到各派出所协助推动宣传工作，出黑板报，教唱歌，开座谈会以及挨门拜访等，着重对劳动人民和家庭妇女进行宣传。小学教师经学习提高政治认识后，主要地也是向学生家长进行宣传。
    现全区十八个派出所已成立了抗美援朝委员会，区委书记已向全区区街代表和防火卫生小组长等九百多人作了动员报告。该区所采取的这种层层建立组织，分工负责，并吸收和运用积极分子参加的工作方法，是值得推广的。
