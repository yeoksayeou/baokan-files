　　Deepen the Propaganda and Education Work of Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries
　　Ma Huanren Liu Enqi

    Recently, achievements have been made in propaganda and education work on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in various regions. Many areas have used newspapers, radio broadcasts, exhibitions, films and dramas, calligraphy and painting, and symposiums to expose the crimes of counter-revolutionaries, reflect the demands of the people, and demonstrate the power of the people's government and its determination to suppress counter-revolutionaries. This has raised the political awareness of the broad masses of people, further recognizing the necessity of severely suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and creating favorable conditions for the future implementation of the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries."

    Experience in various regions has proven that if propaganda and education work on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries can be effectively carried out, first, leaders at all levels must attach importance to this work, and the propaganda departments should formulate propaganda plans and treat it as a regular part of their propaganda work. The public security and judicial organs should closely cooperate with the literary and artistic groups and frequently and proactively provide them with propaganda materials. Regions that have done this have seen their propaganda work unfold rapidly, with great momentum, considerable scale, and sustained strength. Public security and judicial departments in Central South, East China, Northwest and other regions have held joint meetings with propaganda organs to study propaganda work plans and discuss how to coordinate and cooperate. Public security organs in Shanxi and other places have helped writers and artists understand the various crimes of counter-revolutionaries and the heroic struggle of our public security personnel against counter-revolutionaries, and have worked with them to collect and organize materials, so more works on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries have been produced.

    Second, propaganda work on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries should be closely coordinated with the central work of the public security departments and integrated with the current struggle tasks of the people of the whole country. For example, when Shanxi Province banned the Yiguandao sect, it initially publicized government decrees; when arresting the most heinous leaders of the sect, it publicized their crimes of deceiving and defrauding people of their wealth; when the movement had begun but some of the masses still did not sufficiently recognize the Yiguandao's reactionary political nature, it used concrete facts to expose the Yiguandao's crimes of colluding with the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in carrying out counter-revolutionary activities. This played a significant role in promoting the practical work. Cities such as Beijing and Tianjin, and regions such as Northeast, Central South, and Southwest China, have also promoted their work by linking the propaganda work on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries with the current movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the land reform movement.

    Third, the propaganda work on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries must be carried out correctly. For example, on the one hand, we should publicize the severe suppression of counter-revolutionaries who have committed heinous crimes and are incorrigible, and at the same time, we should publicize the lenient treatment of those who have been coerced, have committed minor crimes, and are willing to repent; on the one hand, we should expose the crimes of counter-revolutionaries to raise the vigilance of the people and increase their hatred of counter-revolutionaries, and at the same time, we should prevent exaggerating the enemy's strength and causing panic among the masses; on the one hand, we should point out that the people's government has the power to eliminate all counter-revolutionary remnants, and at the same time, we should prevent the masses from developing paralysis and complacency. In addition, appropriate propaganda work should be carried out separately in light of the different situations in cities and villages, newly liberated areas and old liberated areas, land reform areas and non-land reform areas.

    Fourth, there should be a variety of propaganda methods. Publishing news, radio broadcasts, holding exhibitions, convening representative conferences and accusation meetings and symposiums, publicly showing films and dramas against spies, editing and publishing public security picture albums and popular readings, etc., are all effective propaganda methods worthy of promotion. However, at present, the newspapers in many regions simply and dryly report news of case solving and executions, and the content is not lively or rich enough, which should be improved in the future. Public security exhibitions are divided into two types: large-scale comprehensive ones and small-scale thematic and special case ones (for details, see the article "Experiences of Various Places in Holding Public Security Exhibitions" on page one of this newspaper on March 10). Both have their advantages and disadvantages. If they can be coordinated and used in combination, that is, holding thematic and special case exhibitions more often in peacetime, and accumulating materials for comprehensive exhibitions, the results will be greater. When carrying out the work of banning Yiguandao in Beijing, Shanxi, and Zhangjiakou, the method of "speaking from personal experience" was adopted, organizing Taoists to accuse and "three talents" to perform divination, which was very popular among the masses. In the "Prevent Spies and Oppose Secret Agents" movement in Tianjin, the public security sub-bureaus and police stations separately convened mass symposiums or mass meetings against secret agents in streets, factories, and schools; the police officers of the police stations also told the masses from house to house to pay attention to reading newspapers, reading announcements, and listening to the broadcasts of public trials of secret agents, and promptly collected feedback and answered questions, which was also very popular among the masses. In addition, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries should become one of the regular propaganda contents of propagandists in various places. This is an effective way to mobilize the masses to fight against counter-revolutionaries.

    At present, some regions have not done enough in the propaganda and education work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. In order to carry out this work deeply and extensively, people's organizations such as trade unions, farmers' associations, democratic women's federations, industry and commerce federations, as well as news, publishing, culture, education, art and other agencies and organizations, should attach importance to propaganda and education work on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and treat it as one of the regular tasks. There should be close contact between the public security departments and the above-mentioned agencies and organizations, and the public security departments should provide propaganda materials on time. The shortcomings of some public security personnel who are not actively cooperating with personnel in the propaganda and education departments should be corrected.

    In order to be able to repeatedly and regularly conduct propaganda and education work on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries among the masses, the following three points should be emphasized in terms of propaganda content: First, educate the masses with the evidence of crimes of local counter-revolutionaries and the materials of trials of counter-revolutionaries. Second, publicize the consistency between the criminal activities of counter-revolutionaries and the imperialist, especially the U.S. imperialist, aggressive conspiracies; at the same time, point out that after the counter-revolutionaries are severely suppressed by us, they will inevitably become more concealed, and their sabotage activities will become more frantic, in order to arouse the higher vigilance of the people. Third, vigorously publicize the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries." All localities should fully explain the great significance of the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries" by connecting the specific circumstances of local counter-revolutionary activities, from the harm of counter-revolutionary activities to the people and the motherland, and the relationship between the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the protection of the people's interests and the development of construction undertakings, to fully explain the great significance of the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," and explain that the people's government must severely suppress counter-revolutionary activities. It is necessary to make everyone understand what bad things the counter-revolutionaries have done, why they must be suppressed, and how everyone should assist the government in eliminating counter-revolutionary activities.

　　深入开展镇压反革命的宣传教育工作
    马焕仁　刘恩启
    近来，各地在镇压反革命宣传教育工作上是有成绩的。很多地区都通过报纸、广播、展览会、影剧、书画、座谈会等方式，揭发了反革命分子的罪恶，反映了人民的要求，显示了人民政府的威力与镇压反革命的决心；这样就提高了广大人民群众的政治觉悟，进一步认识到严厉镇压反革命的必要，并为今后贯彻执行“惩治反革命条例”创造了有利条件。
    各地经验证明，如能有效地进行镇压反革命宣传教育工作，首先，各级领导干部必须重视这一工作，宣传部门要订出宣传计划，并作为经常的宣传工作之一，公安、司法机关要与文艺团体密切合作，并经常主动地供给他们宣传材料。凡是这样做的地区，宣传工作就能迅速展开，声势浩大，规模可观，持续有力。中南、华东、西北等地区的公安、司法部门与宣传机关曾举行联席会议，研究宣传工作计划，商讨如何协同配合。山西等地的公安机关，帮助作家及艺人了解反革命分子的种种罪行和我公安人员与反革命分子英勇斗争的事迹，同他们一起搜集、整理材料，因而镇压反革命的作品就产生得较多。
    其次，镇压反革命宣传工作应与公安部门的中心工作密切配合，并与当前全国人民的斗争任务结合进行。如山西省取缔一贯道时，最初是宣传政府法令；待逮捕罪大恶极的道首时，则宣传道首骗人、诈财的罪行；待运动已展开，而部分群众对一贯道在政治上的反动本质尚认识不足时，则以具体事实揭发一贯道勾结日寇及蒋介石匪帮进行反革命活动的罪行。这样对实际工作起了很大的推动作用。北京、天津等城市，东北、中南、西南等地区在进行镇压反革命的宣传工作时，联系了当前的抗美援朝与土地改革运动，也对工作起了推动作用。
    第三，必须正确地进行镇压反革命的宣传工作。如一方面宣传对罪大恶极、怙恶不悛的反革命分子予以严厉镇压，同时又要宣传对胁从分子、罪恶不大而又愿意改悔的分子予以宽大处理；一方面揭露反革命分子的罪行，以提高人民的警惕，增强人民对反革命分子的憎恨，同时又要防止夸大敌人声势，而引起群众的恐慌；一方面要指出人民政府有力量肃清一切反革命残余，同时又要防止群众产生麻痹轻敌思想。此外，还应针对城市与乡村、新解放区与老解放区、土地改革区与非土地改革区的不同情况，分别进行适宜的宣传工作。
    第四，宣传方法要多种多样。如发布新闻，电台广播，举办展览，召开各界代表会和控诉会、座谈会，公演反对奸细的电影、戏剧，编辑出版公安画报与通俗读物等，都是有效的值得提倡的宣传方法。但目前许多地区的报纸，只是简单干枯地报道破案、处决的消息，内容不生动、不丰富，今后应当改进。公安展览会分大规模综合性的与专题、专案小型的两种（详见三月十日本报一版各地举办公安展览会的经验一文）。两者互有长短，如能配合起来，互相为用，即平时多举办专题、专案展览，而为综合性展览积累材料，则收效更大。北京、山西、张家口在进行取缔一贯道工作时，曾采用“现身说法”的方式，组织道徒控诉、“三才”扶乩表演等，极受群众欢迎。天津市曾在“防备奸细反对特务”运动中，由各公安分局、派出所分别召开了街道、工厂、学校的群众座谈会或群众反对特务大会；派出所警士更挨户告诉群众，注意看报纸，看布告，收听公审特务的广播，并及时收集反应，解答疑问，也很受群众的欢迎。此外，镇压反革命工作应成为各地宣传员的经常宣传内容之一。这是发动群众起来与反革命分子进行斗争的有效办法。
    目前，有些地区镇压反革命的宣传教育工作，还作得不够。为了使这一工作深入广泛地展开，各人民团体，如工会、农民协会、民主妇女联合会、工商联合会，以及新闻、出版、文化、教育、艺术等机关团体，应对镇压反革命宣传教育工作给予重视，并当作经常的工作之一。公安部门与上述机关团体之间，应取得密切联系，公安部门应按时供给宣传材料。某些公安人员不积极与宣传教育部门人员合作的缺点，应当纠正。
    为了能反复经常地在群众中进行关于镇压反革命的宣传教育工作，在宣传内容方面，应着重下述三点：一、以当地的反革命分子的罪证，和对于反革命分子的审判材料，来教育群众。二、宣传反革命分子的罪恶活动与帝国主义特别是与美帝国主义侵略阴谋的一致性；同时指出，反革命分子遭我严厉镇压后，必然更趋隐蔽，破坏活动更会疯狂，以引起人民群众的更高警惕。三、大力宣传“惩治反革命条例”。各地应联系当地反革命活动的具体情况，从反革命活动对人民对祖国的危害，镇压反革命对保卫人民利益和开展建设事业的关系等方面，来充分说明“惩治反革命条例”的重大意义，说明人民政府必须严厉镇压反革命活动。务使人人都懂得反革命分子做了那些坏事，为什么必须镇压，大家应当怎样来协助政府肃清反革命活动。
