　　A Bad Cartoon
    Recently, this newspaper has received many letters from readers expressing serious criticism of the cartoon "Kindness to Counter-Revolutionaries is Cruelty to the People" by Comrade Zhou Lushi, published on the front page of this newspaper on April 7th. The cartoon featured the image of a female cadre who displayed timidity, panic, fear, and a complete lack of fighting spirit towards the murderous special agents. It failed to represent the calm courage, unwavering bravery, and indomitable spirit of the Chinese people in their struggle against the enemy. Our nation has had countless outstanding representatives of the people who have displayed this heroic spirit even when counter-revolutionary forces were at their most rampant. There are countless examples of this. Taking women as an example, the heroic self-sacrifice of Liu Hulan, Ding Youjun, and countless heroic martyrs are typical of this noble quality of the Chinese people. Therefore, the image of the cadre depicted in this cartoon is untrue, incorrect, and lacks a firm stance.
    We must severely suppress counter-revolutionaries and be vigilant against their conspiracies and retaliation at all times. However, we must recognize the strength of the people's power today. As long as we correctly grasp the policy of combining suppression with leniency, and as long as the people are vigilant, the conspiracies of counter-revolutionaries will not succeed. Therefore, it is also untrue to one-sidedly exaggerate the ferocity of the enemy. Another shortcoming of the cartoon is that the expressive technique is not clear enough. Does the release of heinous counter-revolutionaries in the first image stem from a policy error or a deviation in the implementation of the policy? This has not been visually explained or annotated with text, leading to reader confusion and speculation. Therefore, the publication of this cartoon is not beneficial to readers, and may even be harmful.
    The editors failed to identify and correct this error before processing the artwork. Their lack of caution and careful consideration of the educational and political effect that a picture should have on readers is an inexcusable and unserious work attitude. Some readers also criticized the editors for failing to carefully consider the impact of the work after publication, which is absolutely necessary.
    The opinions expressed by our readers demonstrate the great responsibility of the broad masses of the people towards the revolutionary cause. They possess a high level of critical ability regarding the ideological and artistic quality of a work of art. Any work that does not conform to the thoughts and feelings of the broad masses of the people will inevitably be criticized by the readers. Therefore, our artists and art editors of newspapers and magazines must strive to improve their ideological and artistic level, so that our works truthfully reflect reality, correctly guide reality, and produce more works that are beneficial to the people.

### 一幅不好的漫画

　　一幅不好的漫画
    最近本报收到了很多读者来信，对于四月七日本报一版刊登周路石同志所作《对于反革命分子的仁慈就是对于人民的残忍》的漫画，提出了严正的批评；这幅画中出现了一个女干部的形象，她对于行凶的特务分子，表现畏缩、惊慌、恐惧和毫无斗志；没有表现中国人民在向敌人的斗争中，那种沉着勇敢，坚强不屈的无畏精神；我们的民族曾经有无数的人民的优秀代表，在反革命势力最猖獗时也都表现了这种英雄气概，这种例子是举不胜举的。就以妇女来说，像刘胡兰、丁佑君以及无数英雄先烈们英勇的自我牺牲，就是中国人民这种高贵品质的典型；因此这画中表现的干部的形象，是不真实的，是不正确的，也是失掉立场的。
    我们要严厉镇压反革命分子，要随时警惕反革命分子的阴谋和报复，但是必须认识今天人民力量是强大的；只要我们正确掌握镇压与宽大相结合的政策，只要人民提高警惕，反革命分子的阴谋就无法得逞，因此片面地去夸张了敌人的凶焰，也是不真实的。画的另一缺点是表现手法不够明确，第一图中释放罪大恶极的反革命分子，究竟是政策错误呢？还是执行政策中的偏向？没有加以形象的说明，或是文字的注解，也引起读者费解和猜测。因此这张画的发表对读者是无益的，甚或是有害的。
    编辑在处理这幅画稿前未能发现这个错误并加改正，不慎重和不仔细考虑一幅图画对读者应起的教育作用和政治的效果，是一种不应原谅和不严肃的工作作风；有的读者也批评编辑应当慎重考虑作品发表后的影响，这是完全必要的。
    我们的读者所提出的意见，表现了广大人民对革命事业的负责精神，他们对一件艺术作品中的思想性和艺术性，具有高度的批判能力；凡是不符合于广大人民思想情感的作品就必定受到读者的批评，因此我们的艺术工作者和报纸杂志的艺术编辑，必须努力提高自己思想水平和艺术水平，使我们的作品真实地反映现实，正确地指导现实，产生更多对人民有益的作品。
