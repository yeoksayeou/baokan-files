Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 5th: The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, at its meeting on the 5th, adopted a statement regarding the Adenauer government's signing of the Schuman Plan.

The statement first strongly condemned the signing of the Schuman Plan, which has completed the steps to carve out the Ruhr area, the industrial center of Germany, from the German economic system.

The statement then pointed out that the Schuman Plan agreement deprives the German people of the power to manage the production, distribution, and sales of the coal and steel industries, which are crucial to the national economy, and the production, distribution, and sales of various industrial sectors directly dependent on heavy industry, in accordance with national interests. The so-called "High Authority" in the Schuman Plan, which is in charge of the heavy industry consortium, will, in reality, be subordinate to aggressive American capital because it will be entirely dependent on American imperialism in terms of credit loans and important raw material sources. The Adenauer government, disregarding the interests of the vast German people, colludes with American imperialism to strengthen the position of West German monopoly capital and ensure they obtain huge profits in the new war preparations. This is the worst and, in terms of its consequences, the most serious of all the measures taken by the Adenauer government to split Germany, remilitarize West Germany, and turn West Germany into a bridgehead for aggressive war.

The government of the German Democratic Republic, representing all the German people, declares that Adenauer and his government, acting under the instructions of the Ruhr coal and steel magnates, have despicably betrayed the vital interests of the German people, and this group must bear full responsibility for this crime.

The Schuman Plan confirms France's annexation of the Saar region. The government of the German Democratic Republic declares that, according to the Potsdam Agreement, the Saar region is German territory and an integral part of Germany. The German people do not recognize now, and will never recognize in the future, the separation of the Saar region from Germany and the annexation of the region by French imperialism.

The signing of this plan precisely at the time of the preparatory meeting of the four foreign ministers in Paris fully exposes the attempt by the Adenauer government and its masters to undermine the four foreign ministers' meeting scheduled to discuss the German question. The signing of the Schuman Plan demonstrates that the Adenauer government has embarked on the road of dragging West Germany into an aggressive war and allying itself militarily, politically, and economically with American imperialism, a path that puts the German people at risk of national disaster.

The statement concluded by stating that the government of the German Democratic Republic firmly condemns the Adenauer government's signing of the Schuman Plan and believes that this plan must and will be defeated. The German Democratic Republic calls on the people of East and West Germany to join hands and unite with all peace-loving European peoples to fight together against this conspiracy of the imperialist warmongers. Strive to conclude a peace treaty with Germany in 1951, thereby eliminating the crisis of a new war. Only when Germany is unified on a democratic basis and cooperates in a friendly manner with all peace-loving countries can the future of the German people be guaranteed.

　　德意志民主共和国部长会议发表声明
    痛斥阿登纳傀儡政府签订舒曼计划
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：据塔斯社柏林五日讯：德意志民主共和国部长会议在五日举行的会议上，对阿登纳政府签订舒曼计划一事通过了一项声明。
    声明首先痛斥舒曼计划的签订，已使从德国经济体系中割取德国工业中心鲁尔区的步骤臻于完成。
    声明接着指出：舒曼计划的协定，剥夺了德国人民按照民族利益管理攸关国民经济命脉的煤钢工业的生产、分配和销售的权力，以及管理直接依赖重工业的各工业部门的生产、分配和销售的权力。舒曼计划中掌管重工业联营的所谓“高级机构”，实际上将从属于侵略性的美国资本，因为它在信用贷款和重要的原料来源方面将完全依赖美帝国主义。阿登纳政府不顾广大德国人民的利益，勾结美帝国主义加强西德垄断资本的地位，并保证它们在新战争准备中获取巨额利润。这是阿登纳政府在分裂德国、使西德重新军国主义化、变西德为侵略战争的桥头堡的一切措施中最坏的而就其后果来说最严重的措施。
    德意志民主共和国政府代表全体德国人民声明：在鲁尔煤钢巨头指令下行动的阿登纳及其政府，卑劣地叛卖了德国人民的切身利益，这个集团应对这件罪行负完全责任。
    舒曼计划确定了法国的吞并萨尔区。德意志民主共和国政府声明：根据波茨坦协定，萨尔区是德国领土，是德国不可分割的部分。德国人民现在不承认、而且将来永远也不承认萨尔区脱离德国和法帝国主义之吞并该区。
    这个计划的签订恰恰在巴黎四国外长会议预备会议进行之时，这就充分暴露了阿登纳政府及其主子们力图破坏预定要讨论德国问题的四国外长会议。舒曼计划的签订说明：阿登纳政府已走上把西德拖入侵略战争并在军事、政治、经济上和美帝国主义结盟的道路，这种道路使德国人民有遭到全民族灾难的危险。
    声明最后称：德意志民主共和国政府坚决谴责阿登纳政府之签订舒曼计划，并认为这个计划必须而且定会被击败。德意志民主共和国号召东西德人民携手并与一切爱好和平的欧洲人民联合起来，共同为反对帝国主义战争贩子的这种阴谋而斗争。争取在一九五一年内缔结对德和约，从而消除新战争的危机。只有德国在民主基础上统一起来并与一切爱好和平的国家友好合作，德国人民的前途才能有保障。
