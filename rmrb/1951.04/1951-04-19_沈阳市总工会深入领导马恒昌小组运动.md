The Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Deeply Leads the Ma Hengchang Group Movement
　　Lin Shan
    Shenyang City began to promote the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang Group in April 1950, and has achieved success in the past year. According to statistics from fourteen industries in March, there are now 384 advanced groups. Under the impetus of these advanced groups, the patriotic labor competition of Shenyang workers has improved. Some enterprises have completed their tasks ahead of schedule, improved product quality, and reduced costs. For example, the Zhang Yichang group in the hardening oil workshop of the Chemical Factory, after joint meetings of three shifts, studied and improved the operating methods, solved the problem of excessive oil content in oil residue soap, and treated soybean oil mucilage, which can save more than 30 million yuan (Northeast currency) per day, and shortened the operating time. Last December, they completed the monthly task in eighteen days, and in January this year, they broke through the original consumption quota. The Chu Hongyi group of the Railway Factory learned from the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group. From April to October last year, for six months, they exceeded the task by 25% every month, and completed the annual task two months ahead of schedule in 1950. The Yang Baozhong milling group of a factory combined with technicians to organize technical mutual assistance, creating more than 100 kinds of tools, large and small, last year, and the quality has been maintained at 99%.
    However, in the work of the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to promote the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, the following main shortcomings still exist: First, the development of advanced groups is not balanced enough. There are nearly 10,000 production groups in Shenyang City, but only 384 advanced groups. Some larger state-owned factories, such as the No. 3 Electric Factory, the No. 9 Machine Factory, and the Equipment Factory, have not yet produced a decent advanced group. Second, the advanced groups are not solid enough. Some industrial trade unions, such as the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Machinery Trade Union, have as many as one-third of the groups under their leadership that cannot be consolidated. Third, some trade union cadres have blindness in promoting the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, and only generally call for promotion. Some groups learn a set of systems and forms, but do not combine the promotion of advanced group experience with solving the key production problems of their own units. According to the above shortcomings, the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions proposed that trade unions at all levels should pay attention to the following points in leading the group work:
    When trade unions promote the experience of the Ma Hengchang advanced group, they should not only promote their system and form, but also grasp the key problems of the industry, factory, and workshop based on the basic spirit of the Ma Hengchang group, and focus on cultivating typical groups (not just discovering them), and then summarize the experience of these groups and vigorously promote them in an organized manner. The method of promoting the Gong Runwen group in the No. 5 Electric Factory is like this. They focused on cultivating the Gong Runwen group, seizing the key problem of the factory's high scrap rate of sand casting in production. The technicians and workers of the Gong Runwen group jointly studied technology and established a system of division of labor and responsibility, which greatly improved the production quality, and the scrap rate dropped from 50% to 60% in the past (the highest was 90%) to 7%. Their factory summarized this experience, and the Party, administration, and trade union concentrated their efforts to vigorously promote it, which drove all groups in the workshop to improve quality and work efficiency. The experience of this kind of advanced group that has been cultivated will not be perfect or at a very high level at the beginning, but it is exactly what this industry and this factory need to solve key problems, and their level is mostly attainable by the general public. Therefore, the effect of promoting this specific experience is very great.
    The key to consolidating and improving advanced groups lies in leadership. Trade union cadres should go deep into the groups to check frequently, find problems, and help solve them in time. For example, some advanced groups were discouraged because they failed to be selected in the evaluation, and have since fallen behind; some groups were dissatisfied because the group leader won the prize, and they were distracted and no longer progressed. When these problems occur, the trade union should immediately educate them.
    The trade union should summarize and exchange advanced experience in a timely manner, and point out a clear direction for advanced groups. Some units have adopted the method of joint meetings of group leaders, which is good. More importantly, the trade union leadership must always pay attention to: combining the work of advanced groups with the requirements of the entire work, so that advanced groups can always stand at the forefront of the movement.
    The leadership style of the group leader has a significant effect on the advanced group. The trade union should pay special attention to cultivating and educating group leaders. The trade union should make the group leader actively responsible and do a good job in uniting the entire group, especially uniting the old technicians. Many advanced groups have truly united and their technology has been rapidly improved only after mobilizing the old technicians. Groups that do not have good relations with old technicians often cannot consolidate their competition. In addition, the trade union should educate group leaders to always care about the thoughts, emotions, and lives of the masses. This is a very important condition for uniting the whole group and giving full play to production enthusiasm.
    In order to facilitate inspection and evaluation, especially to enable the workers to have clear goals to strive for, advanced groups should not only have general requirements, but also have more specific standards in each industry. In January this year, there were 678 advanced groups in Shenyang City. After basic conditions were established and an inspection was carried out, the number was greatly reduced. The competition standards should be appropriate. If they are too high, everyone cannot reach them, and they have no practical significance; if the standards are too low, production cannot be improved, and the due meaning is lost. Too many levels are also inappropriate. Some industries have set very detailed standards, but the masses cannot accept them, and they still fail.

　　沈阳市总工会深入领导马恒昌小组运动
　　林山
    沈阳市从一九五○年四月开始推广马恒昌小组先进经验，一年来是有成绩的。根据三月份十四个产业的统计，现在已经有三百八十四个先进小组。在这些先进小组的带动下，沈阳职工的爱国主义劳动竞赛提高了一步，有些企业单位，提前完成了任务，提高了产品质量，降低了成本。如化学工厂硬化油车间张义昌小组，经过三班联席会议，研究改进操作法，解决油脚皂含油过多，处理了大豆油粘质物问题，每日可节省三千余万元（东北币），并缩短了操作时间，去年十二月份十八天完成了全月任务，今年一月份又突破了原有的消耗定额。铁路工厂初洪义小组学习了马恒昌小组经验，从去年四月份起到十月六个月来，每月超过任务百分之二十五，一九五○年提前两个月完成全年任务。某厂杨宝忠铣刨组和技术人员结合，组织技术互助，去年创造了大小工具一百余种，质量经常保持百分之九十九。
    但是，在沈阳市总工会推广马恒昌小组经验的工作中，还存在以下几个主要缺点：首先是先进小组发展的不够平衡。沈阳市有近万个生产小组，先进小组却只有三百八十四个，有些比较大的国营厂，如电工三厂、机器九厂、装具厂等，还没有出现一个像样的先进小组。其次，先进小组不够巩固，个别产业工会如机械工会沈阳市委员会所领导的小组，竟有三分之一不能巩固。第三、有些工会干部在推广马恒昌小组经验中有盲目性，只是一般号召推广。有些小组学习一套制度、形式，却没有把推广先进小组经验与解决本单位的生产关键问题结合起来。根据上述缺点，沈阳市总工会提出要各级工会在领导小组工作中，注意以下几点：
    工会在推广马恒昌先进小组的经验时，不光是推广他们的制度形式，而是要根据马恒昌小组的基本精神，抓住本产业、本厂、本车间的关键问题，有重点地培养典型小组（不是只去发现），然后把这些小组的经验总结起来，有组织地大力推广。电工五厂推广宫润文小组的作法就是这样的。他们抓住本厂生产中的关键翻砂废品率太高的问题，重点培养宫润文小组。宫润文小组的技术人员与工人共同研究技术，建立了分工负责等制度，生产质量大为提高，废品率从过去百分之五十到六十（最高到过九十），降低到百分之七。他们厂总结了这一经验，党、行政、工会集中力量大力推广，带动了全车间各组都提高了质量和工作效率。这种培养出的先进小组的经验，在开初时还不会十分完善，水平还不会很高，但却正是这一产业这一工厂在解决关键问题上所需要的，他们的水平又多是一般群众所能达到的。因此，推广这种具体经验的效果就很大。
    先进小组巩固和提高的关键在于领导。工会的干部要深入小组经常检查，发现问题，及时帮助解决。譬如有的先进小组因为评选落选，大家泄气，从此落后了；有的小组因为小组长得奖，大家不满意，散了心，不再进步了。有了这些问题，工会要马上对他们进行教育。
    工会要及时总结、交流先进经验，给先进小组指出明确方向。有的单位采取小组长联席会的办法，是好的。更重要的是工会领导上必须经常注意：使先进小组工作和整个工作要求相结合，使先进小组能经常站在运动的前面。
    小组长的领导作风对于先进小组有重大作用。工会应该特别注意培养、教育小组长。工会要使小组长积极负责，作好团结全组特别是团结老技工的工作。不少先进小组都是在发动了老技工之后，小组才真正团结了，技术才能迅速提高。和老技工关系搞不好的小组，竞赛常常不能巩固。另外工会要教育小组长经常关心群众的思想、情绪、生活等。这是团结全组，发挥生产积极性很重要的条件。
    为了便于检查、评判，特别是使工人群众有明确的奋斗目标，对先进小组不只要有一般的要求，各产业还应该有比较具体的标准。沈阳市今年一月有六百七十八个先进小组后来订了基本条件，进行一次检查以后，就减少了很多。竞赛标准要适当，太高大家达不到，没有实际意义；标准太低，不能提高生产，也失掉了应有的意义。等级太多也不合适，有的产业订了很细的标准，但群众接受不了，还是落了空。
