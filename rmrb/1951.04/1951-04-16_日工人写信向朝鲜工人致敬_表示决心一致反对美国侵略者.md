　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 14th: According to a report in *Labor News*, the Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Japan sent a letter of respect on behalf of all workers in Japan to the Korean working class, who are fighting heroically against the American imperialist aggressors.

    The letter stated: It is very clear that the American imperialists' aggression against Korea is bound to fail. The heroic actions of Korean workers and peasants, as well as the Chinese People's Volunteers, will surely stop the American imperialists' plans for aggression.

    The letter pointed out: The American imperialists are not only your enemies but also the enemies of the working masses of Japan. At present, the American imperialists and their agents are cruelly exploiting and oppressing the workers and peasants of Japan, just as the Japanese imperialists formerly exploited and oppressed the working masses of Korea. Japanese workers demand the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and demand the immediate withdrawal of the American occupation forces. They oppose being used as cannon fodder for imperialist wars of aggression.

　　日工人写信向朝鲜工人致敬
　  表示决心一致反对美国侵略者
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社平壤十三日讯：《劳动新闻》报道：日本世界工会联合会联络事务局代表日本全国工人，向为反对美帝国主义侵略者而英勇战斗着的朝鲜工人阶级发出致敬信。
    信中说：十分明显，美帝国主义者对朝鲜的侵略必将归于失败，朝鲜工人和农民以及中国人民志愿军的英勇行动，必将制止住美帝国主义者的侵略计划。
    信中指出：美帝国主义者不仅是你们的敌人，也是日本劳苦大众的敌人。目前美帝国主义者及其代理人残酷地剥削和压迫日本的工人和农民，正像日本帝国主义者从前剥削和压迫朝鲜劳苦大众一样。日本工人要求缔结全面对日和约，要求美国占领军立刻撤退。他们反对被人利用去充当帝国主义侵略战争的炮灰。
