　　Accusation of Zhu Youyu, Running Dog of American Imperialism
　　Chen Jianzhen, Chairman of the House of Bishops of the Chinese Anglican Church
　　In a heavy mood filled with shame, grief, and indignation, I stand here to accuse Zhu Youyu—former Bishop of the Yunnan-Guizhou Diocese of the Chinese Anglican Church, and General Secretary of the Central Office of the Chinese Anglican Church—of being an aggressive tool of American imperialism and a degenerate element within the Christian church. For a bishop of the Chinese Anglican Church to accuse another bishop is no simple matter. But standing on the side of the people, for the love of our motherland and the love of our church, I must accuse him today. I wish he could hear our accusations these past two days, so that he would know that, having received years of Christian doctrine, he has failed to demonstrate the spirit of a true Christian, loyal to the people and loyal to the motherland, but has degenerated into an aggressive tool of American imperialism and a counter-revolutionary degenerate, and how he has let down the motherland and the church.

　　I accuse him of betraying the people and becoming a reactionary political tool of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. In 1938, he and Chen Wenyuan joined the reactionary Three People's Principles Youth League. In 1944, he went to Chongqing to see Chiang Kai-shek, and afterwards returned to Kunming on Chennault's bomber, and even felt this was something to be proud of. In the later period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he also became a U.S. military chaplain, wore a U.S. military uniform, and took pride in it. After liberation, he twice illegally left the country with a fake Kuomintang government passport. In July 1949, he attended the Central Committee meeting of the World Council of Churches in Canada, which passed a reactionary resolution supporting American imperialism in its war of aggression against Korea.

　　What is even more infuriating is that after the liberation of Shanghai and before the liberation of Guangzhou, Zhu Youyu spread anti-communist and anti-Soviet remarks in Guangzhou, saying that Christianity and communism could not coexist, that China should not regard the Soviet Union as a good friend, and that the Sino-Soviet alliance was actually a disadvantage for China, and so on.

　　I accuse him of not loving the church and of undermining the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the church. The Shaanxi Missionary District of the Chinese Anglican Church has always been a self-supporting diocese of Chinese believers. But since he also served as the General Secretary of the Missionary Department of the General Synod of the Chinese Anglican Church, he used donations from American missions to provide funding for the Shaanxi Missionary District, undermining the original foundation of self-reliance. At the national Christian conference scheduled to be held in 1950, he served as the chairman of the preparatory committee, but disregarded his work and left China privately. In November 1950, when he resigned from the post of General Secretary of the Central Office of the Chinese Anglican Church, he originally claimed that he would go to the South China Diocese as an assistant bishop, but after leaving Shanghai in early December, he went to Hong Kong and then to the United States. Recently, he even wrote a letter saying that he could raise donations for the Shaanxi Missionary District in the United States, attempting to undermine the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement of the church. This matter has been sternly rejected by the Missionary District.

　　Judging from Zhu Youyu's thoughts and behavior, he is a typical pro-American: he received American-style education from an early age, imitated Americans in his lifestyle, liked to associate with foreigners on weekdays, and was unwilling to approach the Chinese people. He wrote letters and records in English, calculated accounts in US dollars, and even imitated the tone of foreigners when speaking Chinese. He has been to the United States more than ten times in his life. Before liberation, his whole family moved to the United States. How could such a life not be pro-American and worship America? Secondly, he is a person who caters to the powerful and seeks personal gain, without noble principles. To illustrate with just one example: at the General Synod meeting of the Chinese Anglican Church in 1947, Zhu Youyu actually proposed that Wu Guozhen, a bandit, be appointed as the Minister of the Missionary Department. Although his proposal was rejected by the conference, it shows us that he only knew how to cater to the reactionary Kuomintang bureaucrats, and did not care about the cause of the church.

　　It is shameful that Zhu Youyu, who is so pro-American and worships America, does not love the motherland, and has degenerated into a reactionary political tool and echo of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Such a person who does not love the motherland is a degenerate element among the people; if he does not wake up, he can only follow American imperialism to its doom. Such a person who does not love the motherland and does not love the church cannot bear witness to the truth of Christ before all people, but shames the church. This is a sinner of the church and is not worthy to be called a bishop in the church of the people's China. Our church cannot tolerate the existence of such degenerate elements. We want to ask the South China Diocese to clarify whether Zhu Youyu is still their assistant bishop and to deal with him immediately.

　　That such a person could serve as a bishop in our church for more than ten years shows that we must reflect on our own church. First of all, in the past, we failed to pay attention to the position and backbone of the staff we selected. Secondly, our church lacks a system of learning and open review, and cannot correct the mistakes of the staff in time. The staff responsible for leadership lack a sense of responsibility and tolerate to the point of laissez-faire. I myself must also reflect: due to the petty-bourgeois sentimentality being too strong, the determination of struggle is not enough, and there is a lack of a spirit of hating evil as an enemy and a sense of justice, and the vigilance is not high. Otherwise, I would not have waited until I attended this conference to know about the reactionary resolution of the "World Council of Churches."

　　We must transform today's shame, grief, and indignation into strength. I would like to ask the Anglican believers attending this conference to return to their work posts, not only to convey the spirit and resolutions of the conference, but also to take responsibility for persuading, influencing, educating, and transforming the backward elements in our Anglican Church. If there are degenerate elements who still do not repent and reform, we must report, accuse, and expel them. We must learn and launch a struggle against the remaining influence of American imperialism in the church. If we cannot thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of imperialism in our ideology, even if the church achieves self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation in form, it will still leave gaps for imperialism to exploit. Ubiquitous imperialist elements will still attempt to use Christianity to turn each of us into Zhu Youyu.

　　We have the confidence to eliminate the influence of imperialism in the church, so that each of our believers can become people who truly love the motherland and love the church, and participate in the ranks of the great Chinese people and shout:
　　Long live the People's Republic of China!
　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　控诉美帝国主义走狗朱友渔
    中华圣公会主教院主席主教　陈见真
    在充满着羞愧、悲痛和愤慨的沉重心情中，我站在这里控诉朱友渔——前中华圣公会云贵教区主教，中华圣公会中央办事处总干事——他是美帝国主义的侵略工具，是基督教会中的败类。一个中华圣公会的主教，如果要控诉另一个主教，不是一件简单的事。但是站在人民的立场上，为爱祖国，爱教会，我今天必须控诉他。我巴不得他听到我们这两天的控诉，让他知道，自己受了多年基督教教义的栽培，没有表现出一个真基督徒的精神，忠于人民忠于祖国，而堕落成为美帝国主义的侵略工具、反革命的败类，是如何对不起祖国，对不起教会。
    我控诉他背叛人民，做了美帝国主义和蒋匪帮的反动政治工具。一九三八年他和陈文渊参加了反动的三民主义青年团。一九四四年他往重庆见蒋匪介石，事后坐陈纳德的轰炸机回昆明，还觉得这是可骄傲的。抗日战争后期，他又做了美军牧师，穿上美军制服，并且以此为荣。解放后他曾两次非法以伪国民党政府护照私自出国。一九四九年七月，他在加拿大参加了世界基督教协进会中央委员会会议，该会议通过了支持美帝国主义进行侵略朝鲜战争的反动决议案。
    还有令人愤恨的，是在上海解放后，广州解放前，朱友渔在广州散布反共反苏言论，说基督教与共产主义不能共存，说中国不应该以苏联为好朋友，中苏同盟实在是中国吃亏等等。
    我控诉他不爱教会，而且破坏教会三自运动。中华圣公会陕西传道区素来是中国信徒自养教区。但自他兼任中华圣公会总议会传道部总干事后，便以美国差会捐款供给陕西传道区经费，破坏了原来自立自养的基础，一九五○年拟开的全国基督教会议，他担任筹备委员会主席，却不顾工作，便私自离开中国。一九五○年十一月，他辞去中华圣公会中央办事处总干事职务时，原称到华南教区做副主教，但是十二月初离开上海后，即赴香港转往美国。最近还来信说他可在美国为陕西传道区捐款，企图破坏教会三自革新运动，此事已经该传道部严词拒绝。
    从朱友渔的思想为人来看，他是一个典型的亲美者：从小受的教育是美国式的教育，生活方式模仿美国人，平日最欢喜与洋人来往，而不愿接近中国人民，写信记录用英文，计算账目以美金为标准，甚至说中国话都要模仿外国人说中国话的腔调。他一生往美国有十余次之多。解放前全家都迁往美国。这样的生活那能不亲美、崇美呢？其次他是一个迎逢权贵、谋求个人利益，没有高尚原则的人。只举一个实例来说明：一九四七年中华圣公会总议会会议时，朱友渔竟提议由吴匪国桢任传道部部长。虽然他的提案被大会否决，但从这里可使我们看出他只知逢迎国民党反动官僚，而不以教会事业为念。
    像朱友渔这样亲美崇美，不爱祖国，以致堕落成为美帝国主义和蒋匪帮的反动政治工具、应声虫，是可耻的。这样不爱祖国的人，是人民中的败类；若不觉悟，只有跟着美帝国主义走向灭亡。这样不爱祖国，不爱教会的人，不能为基督的真理在万人面前作见证，反羞辱了教会，这是教会的罪人，是不配在人民中国的教会里被称为主教的。我们的教会中不能容许这样的败类存在。我们要请华南教区说明朱友渔是否仍是他们的副主教，并立刻加以处理。
    像这样一个人竟然能在我们教会中担任主教十多年，我们对自己的教会，就不能不有所检讨。首先，过去选任工作人员，未能注意其立场与骨格。其次，我们的教会中缺乏学习和公开检讨的制度，不能及时纠正工作人员的错误。负领导责任的工作人员缺乏责任感，容忍流于放任。我自己也要作检讨：由于小资产阶级的情面观点太重，斗争的坚决性不够，缺乏嫉恶如仇的精神与正义感，警惕性不高，否则我不会等到参加此次大会才知道“世界基督教协进会”的反动决议案。
    我们要把今天的惭愧、悲痛、愤慨化为力量。我要请参加此次大会的圣公会信徒回到本工作岗位，不但传达大会的精神和决议，更要负起责任来说服、感化、教育、改造我们圣公会里的落后分子。如果有堕落分子仍不悔过自新，我们就要检举、控诉、驱逐他们。我们要学习，对教会中残余的美帝国主义影响展开斗争。如果我们在思想意识上不能彻底肃清帝国主义的毒害影响，则纵令教会在形式上实现了自立自养自传，还是给帝国主义留下可钻的空隙。无孔不入的帝国主义分子仍将企图利用基督教把我们每一个人都变成朱友渔。
    我们有信心，能够肃清在教会里面的帝国主义影响，使我们每一个信徒成为真正爱祖国，爱教会的人民，参加在伟大的中国人民的行列中高呼：
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
