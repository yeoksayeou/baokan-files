Over Two Million Workers Nationwide
Participate in Patriotic Production Competition
Some Units' Competition Movement Develops Towards a Normal Direction

Since the Ma Hengchang Group issued a challenge to workers nationwide on January 17th, patriotic labor competitions have further developed across various regions as workers have responded enthusiastically. According to incomplete statistics, the number of factories and mines participating in the competition nationwide has reached 2,811, an increase of over 134 percent compared to December of last year. The number of workers participating in the competition is 2,232,000, an increase of over 86 percent compared to December of last year. A total of 5,522 groups nationwide have responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group. Some trade union organizations in the Northeast region, such as the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, have made the organized and planned promotion of advanced production experience the main content of their leadership in the competition. The competition conditions of many workshops and groups have begun to combine with solving the current key production problems of their units. Some trade unions have begun to actively consolidate grassroots trade union organizations during the movement. The labor competition is showing a new atmosphere and is beginning to develop from a crash campaign to a normal state. The production competition in enterprise departments in many regions within the customs (关内, i.e. inside the Great Wall) is also more extensive than before. Many groups have formulated more realistic competition conditions and have begun to pay attention to overcoming the blindness and rush nature of the competition.

In the competition movement, some units have continuously improved production efficiency due to their attention to learning and promoting advanced experience. For example, after Jiang Wanshou of the Northeast Clothing Factory No. 1 changed the labor organization, he can complete the annual task three months ahead of schedule. Eight industries in Shenyang City, including clothing, rubber, and leather, widely adopted this advanced experience, and production efficiency has generally increased by 20 percent compared to the past. The Chu Hongyi Group of the Shenyang Railway Factory promoted the Soviet Kovalev's working method, and output increased threefold. Yang Youde, a lathe worker at the Shenyang No. 4 Machine Tool Plant, applied the experience of the Soviet "high-speed cutting method," which increased production efficiency by 21 times. After the Wang Yongxiang ironworker team of the Changsha Engineering Section responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group, they learned from the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, exceeded the task by 68 percent in February, and did not produce a single defective product throughout the month.

In the labor competition, workers in various regions have fully demonstrated their high patriotic enthusiasm and wisdom, and new records are constantly emerging. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant created eight new records in a row from January 1st to 7th, creating a new record of smelting a furnace of high-speed molten steel in four hours and fifty-four minutes. The Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant has repeatedly set new records for steel ingot production. For example, taking the highest output last year as 100, it was 103.5 on February 13th, 125 on February 18th, 127.5 on March 3rd, and 156.35 on March 9th, increasing the country's wealth by more than 580,000 jin (斤, a Chinese unit of weight) of millet. After the Du Laishun lathe team of the Machinery Plant of the Central China Iron and Steel Company responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group, they set three new records in a row in one month, reducing the time to turn a mine car wheel from three hours to fifteen minutes, increasing production efficiency by eleven times. On March 22nd, the Luo Yongjin wind pick team of the Fengfeng Coal Mine created a national record of 254.4 tons of coal mined in seven hours and two minutes.

With the continuous improvement of labor efficiency, many factories and mines have completed the first quarter's production tasks ahead of schedule. The Northeast State-owned Textile Factory completed the first quarter's task ahead of schedule on March 20th. In Shenyang alone, 38 factories and mines completed the first quarter's tasks ahead of schedule. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant completed the first quarter's task ahead of schedule on March 25th.

On the other hand, there are still many shortcomings in the movement. The most important is that the responsible persons of some units do not pay enough attention to the Ma Hengchang Group's competition movement and lack in-depth and specific organizational leadership work. For example, some trade unions simply called on the workers on the radio; some trade unions were indifferent to the spontaneous competition of the masses; some units, in order to be the first to respond to the challenge, did not consult the masses, but a few cadres and a few activists monopolized the competition, and the masses did not know what was going on. This lack of enthusiastic support for the spontaneous enthusiasm of the masses and the lack of specific organizational leadership for the production competition are the main reasons for the competition to become a formality. The second shortcoming is that the competition plan is not specific and is formalistic. For example, the competition conditions of some groups in the Xi'an People's Machinery Factory are extremely unspecific, and there are also slogans such as "Strive to build a new China," "Respond to the call, learn technology, and use your brains," and "Contact the masses more" as competition conditions. Therefore, this kind of competition is formalistic. The third shortcoming is that the competition is not combined with various tasks, and the competition is carried out in isolation, ignoring business management and safety technical regulations. For example, some coal mines ignored safe production during the competition, resulting in an increase in accidents. In the Fushun Open-pit Mine, six accidents occurred in four days in mid-March. These shortcomings should be gradually overcome in the development of the movement.

### 全国二百多万职工  参加爱国主义生产竞赛  某些单位竞赛运动向正常方向发展

　　全国二百多万职工
    参加爱国主义生产竞赛
    某些单位竞赛运动向正常方向发展
    自从一月十七日马恒昌小组向全国职工提出挑战，各地职工纷纷应战后，爱国主义劳动竞赛已有更进一步的发展。根据目前不完全的统计，全国各地参加竞赛的厂矿单位已达二千八百一十一个，比去年十二月份增加了百分之一百三十四强。参加竞赛的职工有二百二十三万二千名，比去年十二月份增加了百分之八十六强。全国已有五千五百二十二个小组向马恒昌小组应战。东北地区若干工会组织，例如沈阳市总工会，已把有组织有计划地推广先进的生产经验，作为领导竞赛的主要内容。许多车间及小组的竞赛条件，已开始与解决本单位当前的生产关键问题相结合。若干工会已开始在运动中积极地整顿工会基层组织。劳动竞赛呈现着一种新的气象，开始从突击向正常发展。关内许多地区的企业部门的生产竞赛，其规模比从前也更加广泛了，很多小组都订出了比较切合实际的竞赛条件，开始注意克服竞赛中的盲目性和突击性。
    在竞赛运动中，有些单位由于注意学习与推广先进经验，生产效率不断提高。如东北被服一厂姜万寿改变了劳动组织后，可提前三个月完成全年任务。沈阳市被服、橡胶、皮革等八个产业，广泛地采用了这一先进经验，生产效率比过去普遍提高了百分之二十。沈阳铁路工厂初鸿义小组推广了苏联科瓦列夫的工作方法，产量增加了三倍。沈阳第四机器厂车工杨有德运用了苏联“高速切削法”的经验，使生产效率提高二十一倍。长沙工务段王永祥铁工班向马恒昌小组应战后，学习了马恒昌小组的经验，二月份超过任务百分之六十八，全月没出一件废品。
    各地职工群众在劳动竞赛中，充分地发挥了高度的爱国热情和智慧，新纪录不断涌现。太原钢铁厂一月一日至七日连创八次新纪录，创造了四小时五十四分钟炼一炉高速熔钢的新纪录。唐山钢铁厂钢锭产量连创四次新纪录。如以去年最高产量为一百，今年二月十三日为一○三点五，二月十八日为一二五，三月三日为一二七点五，三月九日为一五六点三五，给国家增加财富五十八万多斤小米。华中钢铁公司机械厂杜莱顺车工班向马恒昌小组应战后，一个月中连创三次新纪录，车一个矿车轮由三小时降低到十五分钟，提高生产效率十一倍。峰峰煤矿风镐手罗永金小组三月二十二日以七小时零二分钟的时间，创造了采煤二五四点四吨的全国最高纪录。
    随着劳动效率的不断提高，很多厂矿提前完成了第一季度的生产任务。东北国营纺织厂于三月二十号提前完成第一季度任务。沈阳一地就有三十八个厂矿提前完成了第一季任务。石景山钢铁厂于三月二十五日提前超额完成了第一季度任务。
    另一方面，运动中还存在着不少的缺点。最主要的是若干单位的负责人员，对马恒昌小组竞赛运动重视不够，缺乏深入具体的组织领导工作。如有的工会只简单的在广播机上向工人群众号召一下；有的工会对群众自发的竞赛漠不关心；有的单位为了抢先应战，不经群众讨论，而由少数几个干部和几个积极分子包办竞赛，群众还不知道是怎么回事。这种对于群众的自发热情，不予以热烈支持，对于生产竞赛，缺少具体组织的领导作风，是使竞赛流于形式的主要原因。第二个缺点是竞赛计划不具体和形式主义。如西安人民机器厂有些小组应战条件极不具体，还有以“努力建设新中国”，“响应号召，学习技术，开动脑筋”，“多联系群众”等口号作为竞赛条件的。因此，这种竞赛是形式主义的。第三个缺点是：竞赛没有和各项工作结合起来，孤立地搞竞赛，忽视经营管理和安全技术规程。如某些煤矿竞赛时，忽视安全生产，致使事故增加。抚顺露天矿三月中旬在四天中就发生了六次事故。这些缺点，是应该在运动的发展中逐步克服的。
