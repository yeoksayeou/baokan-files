Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch: The American warmonger, the so-called "Supreme Commander of the European North Atlantic Treaty Army," Eisenhower, formally took office in Paris on April 2nd.

The establishment of Eisenhower's headquarters is the result of his busy work for a full three months. After inspecting various Western European countries in January, he returned from the United States to Paris again on February 21st. After much activity, he barely managed to put together a staff for his headquarters, and on March 20th, he appointed a group of senior commanders of the North Atlantic invasion army. These included the Supreme Commander's "Chief Assistant": British Field Marshal Montgomery, and the "Air Force Assistant": British Air Chief Marshal Sanders. In addition, under the advice of Nazi war criminal and former Hitler Chief of Staff Guderian, Eisenhower divided the entire Western Europe into three war zones: North, Central, and South, and appointed commanders for the three war zones.

However, the establishment of Eisenhower's headquarters did not alleviate the serious difficulties the United States faced in organizing a unified European invasion army. To date, this invasion army is still a "paper army" "with officials but no soldiers." As early as the beginning of March, Associated Press military reporter Fisher pessimistically estimated: by the end of this year, the Atlantic Treaty nations would have only twelve combat-ready divisions in Western Europe. "These twelve divisions are the occupation forces of the United States, Britain, and France stationed in Germany - six American divisions (note: the United States currently has only two divisions in West Germany; here, the four divisions that the United States has repeatedly proclaimed but still does not know when they will be sent to Western Europe are also included in the calculation), three British divisions, and three French divisions. They will form the army that Eisenhower can immediately use."

At the same time, although Eisenhower's headquarters appears in the posture of a "unified" invasion machine of the North Atlantic countries, the serious suspicions and contradictions within the entire North Atlantic group remain unresolved. This is first manifested in the endless dispute within the U.S. ruling group over the issue of whether to send troops to Europe. Even Eisenhower himself had to admit with distress at the press conference announcing his inauguration: "The U.S. Congress's delay in approving the sending of U.S. troops to Europe is dangerous," and he cried out loudly, "The United States must set an example for other countries."

### 艾森豪威尔总部勉强凑成　美统治集团对派兵赴欧争吵不休

　　艾森豪威尔总部勉强凑成
  　美统治集团对派兵赴欧争吵不休
    【新华社十日讯】美国战争贩子，所谓“欧洲北大西洋公约军最高统帅”艾森豪威尔已于四月二日在巴黎宣布正式上任。
    艾森豪威尔这个总部的建立是他忙碌了整整三个月的结果。他在今年一月间巡视西欧各国之后，又自二月二十一日自美国重新回到巴黎，经过多方活动之后，才勉强替自己的总部凑成了一副班底，在三月二十日任命了一批北大西洋侵略军的高级指挥官。其中包括最高统帅“主要助理”：英国陆军元帅蒙哥马利，“空军助理”：英国空军总监桑德斯上将。此外，艾森豪威尔在纳粹战犯、前希特勒参谋长古德林献计之下，把整个西欧划分为北、中、南三个战区，并任命了三个战区的指挥官。
    但是，艾森豪威尔总部的成立，并没有使美国在组织欧洲统一侵略军方面的严重困难因此而有所消减。迄今为止，这支侵略军仍只是“有官无兵”的“纸上的军队”。美联社军事记者费氏在三月初就曾悲观地估计：到今年年底以前，大西洋公约国家在西欧只有十二个可以作战的师。“这十二个师是美英法三国的驻德占领军——六个美国师（按美国现在西德仅有二个师，这里是把美国所一再扬言而现在还不知道什么时候派到西欧去的四个师也计算在内了）、三个英国师、三个法国师。它们将组成艾森豪威尔可以立即使用的军队。”
    同时，虽然艾森豪威尔总部以北大西洋各国“统一”的侵略机器的姿态出现，但是整个北大西洋集团内部严重的猜疑与矛盾却仍然无法解决。这首先就表现在美国统治集团间对是否派兵到欧洲去的问题迄今争吵不休。这连艾森豪威尔自己在宣布上任的记者招待会上都不得不苦恼地承认：“美国国会迟迟不通过派美军到欧洲是危险的”，他大声哀号“美国必须为其他国家树立榜样”。
