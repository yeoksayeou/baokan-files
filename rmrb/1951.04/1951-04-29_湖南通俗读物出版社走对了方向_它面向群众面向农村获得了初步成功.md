　　Hunan Popular Reading Publishing House is on the Right Track
　  -- Its Focus on the Masses and Rural Areas Has Achieved Initial Success

   　To establish such a publishing house!
    After the national publishing conference last year, the representatives from Hunan who attended the conference returned to Changsha and began to consider establishing a popular reading publishing institution. This consideration was completely appropriate and necessary.
    At that time, a portion of the private printing industry in Changsha could no longer engage in the "pirated book" business, and general private bookstores were also in a state of depressed business; however, the broad masses were urgently in need of beneficial popular books and periodicals, and they were almost "undiscriminating in their hunger." One old bookstore compiled and printed a 《Reader for Workers and Peasants》 full of errors, yet it still sold more than 100,000 copies. In contrast, this inspired people: the way out for popular publishing houses is broad.
    How to establish it? Private bookstores had varying degrees of deficiencies and difficulties in terms of manpower and funds, and they were also mixed with more or less feudalistic regionalism; more importantly, there was a need for leaders. At this time, the New Hunan Daily, the Dazhong (Masses) Daily, and the Hunan Provincial Land Reform Committee decided to invest in supporting this cause. Thus, starting from mid-November, under the specific leadership of the Hunan Provincial People's Government's Press and Publication Department, everyone was united and preparatory work was carried out. On January 10, the Hunan Popular Reading Publishing House was formally established.
    The publishing house planned to raise a capital stock of 100 million, divided into 1,000 shares, each share worth 100,000. This gave every small bookstore the opportunity to participate. As a result, 52 of the 70 private bookstores in Changsha participated.
  What to do if there are no editors?
    The publishing house was established, so it had to publish books, but everywhere there was a "editor shortage," and it was difficult to find someone to be responsible for the editing work for a while. What to do?
    The first method: Closely cooperate with newspapers, especially with the Dazhong Daily. The newspaper already had a batch of existing forces, and some of these forces could be used by the publishing house in addition to dealing with newspaper work. Now, the Dazhong Daily has systematically edited a set of "Must-Reads for the Masses" for the publishing house, two of which have been published, and three are in print.
    The second method: Seek the help of relevant agencies. The 《Land Reform Reader》 jointly compiled by the Provincial Land Reform Committee and the Provincial Farmers' Association has been submitted to the publishing house for publication, and the 《Militia Textbook》 compiled by the Political Department of the Hunan Military Region has also been printed. The Provincial Department of Culture and Education, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Hunan Branch of the China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, and several cultural troupes are all preparing materials for the publishing house.
    The third method: Compile and select the works of workers and peasants; unite old artists and old novelists to create.
    In addition to these methods, an editorial review committee was established in general.
    By adopting methods such as close cooperation with newspapers and seeking assistance from relevant agencies, the problem of writing was largely solved, and the writings could meet the current needs of the broad masses.
  What to publish? How should it be published?
    Today, among the masses in the new areas, where and who is most urgently in need of popular readings? The peasants in the vast rural areas. This affirms that the publishing house must truly face the countryside.
    What do the peasants in the new areas urgently need? Among their broad interests, the most important is still popular political readings, current affairs education readings, especially readings related to the land reform movement and production movement that are closely related to them (popular literature and art are also needed, but not urgently needed). Thus, we decided that in the proportion of publications, readers must account for 20%, general political and current affairs readings must account for 35%, application writing must account for 10%, and popular literature and art (including various literary and artistic forms) must account for 35%. (Editor's note: Some readings on agricultural and sideline production knowledge and medical and health knowledge should also be published.)
    How should it be published? According to one's own strength, and in response to these needs, the approach of "rather publish fewer types, but sell more copies" is adopted. More sales require that it be loved by the masses and needed by the masses. Doing so can also avoid the phenomenon of blind publishing and prevent the accumulation of unsalable goods and the hoarding of dead capital.
    The printed books must also be easy for peasants to read, digest, and carry conveniently, and more importantly, they must be affordable. This affirms that the font should be large (now using No. 4 or Old No. 5 regular script), the book should be thin and small (generally 50 open, at most no more than 40 pages), and the price should be cheap (among the published books, the highest price for a copy is 700 yuan).
  How to distribute the books?
    After the books come out, how to get them into the hands of readers? One way is to hand them over to the post office for distribution, with direct contact from the publishing house. The comrades in the management department have done some investigation and understanding work and decided to put more effort into remote counties and counties with underdeveloped book industries. The results prove that in Daoxian County, Xiangxi, with a population of only 30,000, 90 trial sales books were sent to the post office and sold out in one afternoon. The post office system alone will sell at least 15,000 copies of each book.
    For private bookstores, various methods are used to encourage sales, and the discounts are fair to both public and private parties; fearing that they will not sell, a batch of books can be selected for trial sales first; fearing that they will not be sold out, the books can be returned. Now, almost all private bookstores in Changsha are placing the books of the Popular Reading Publishing House in a prominent position in the window display. The facts also prove that there are no stocks that can be returned. These books can not only be sold, but also be sold out.
    In the city, there are also some small book vendors who take these popular readings and peddle them in many remote alleys, which can go deeper into the masses.
    The distribution of popular readings is also a mass work. If it is not done well, popular readings are only "popular" halfway.
  If the direction is right, there will be achievements!
    The publishing house has only been established for just over 100 days. As of April 18, it has published nine kinds of popular readings and one copy of the 《Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries》, with a total circulation of 565,000 copies. Among them, there are 《Land Reform Reader》 Volumes 1, 2, and 3 (330,000 copies sold), 《Four-Character Scripture for Production and Prosperity》 (40,000 copies sold), 《Four Agricultural Labor Models in Hunan》 (20,000 copies sold) promoting land reform and agricultural production; 《Freedom of Marriage Song》 (40,000 copies sold) promoting the Marriage Law; and 《Two Worlds》 (25,000 copies sold), 《How American Imperialism Uses Japan》 (20,000 copies sold), and 《The Soviet Union Also Has Atomic Bombs》 (20,000 copies sold) promoting current affairs. The 《Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries》 has also sold 70,000 copies.
    Readers (especially peasants) love popular readings. As soon as the publishing house's new book advertisements were published in the Dazhong Daily, the newspaper received many letters requesting to buy new books on their behalf. Post offices across the country wrote to the publishing house saying, "These books are very popular with the masses, and our sales performance is very good!"
    Despite the shortage of funds and the lack of manpower, because the direction is right, it can be closely integrated with the needs of the masses, and it is willing to think of more ways, so it can overcome difficulties and achieve some results.
    The Hunan Popular Reading Publishing House is moving forward with such confidence, and is now working hard to strive to publish 70 to 80 kinds of books and distribute 3.5 million to 4 million copies this year.

　　湖南通俗读物出版社走对了方向
　  ——它面向群众面向农村获得了初步成功
　　傅白芦
   　成立这样一个出版社！
    去年全国出版会议开过以后，湖南出席会议的代表回到长沙，便开始酝酿成立一个通俗读物的出版机构。这种酝酿，是完全适合时宜，适合需要的。
    当时，长沙的一部分私营印刷业已经没有“翻版书”的生意可做，一般的私营书店也都处在营业不振的苦闷状态之中；而广大的群众，却正迫切需要有益于他们的通俗书刊，他们几乎是“饥不择食”。有一家旧书店编印了一本错误百出的《工农读本》，竟也销行了十万册以上。两相对比，这就启发了人们：通俗出版社的出路是广阔的。
    怎样成立呢？私营书店在人力和资金上都有不同程度的缺乏和困难，而且还夹杂着或多或少的具有封建意识的地域性；更重要的，是需要带头人。这时，新湖南报、大众报、湖南省土地改革委员会就决定投资来支持这个事业。这样，就从十一月中旬开始，在湖南省人民政府新闻出版处具体领导下，团结大家，进行了筹备工作。到一月十日，湖南通俗读物出版社正式成立。
    出版社预定筹集股金一亿，分成一千股，每股十万元。使得每个小书店都有参加的机会。因之长沙七十家私营书店中，就有五十二家参加了。
  没有编辑，怎么办？
    出版社成立了，就得出书，但到处都闹“编辑荒”，一时很难找到专人负责编辑工作，怎么办呢？
    第一个办法：与报社紧密合作，特别是与大众报。报社已经有了一批现成的力量，这批力量除了对付报纸工作以外，还有一些可以用到出版社来。现在，大众报已为出版社有计划的主编一套“大众必读”，出了两种，付印的有三种。
    第二个办法：争取有关机关的帮助。省土地改革委员会和省农民协会合编的《土地改革读本》，已交由出版社出版，湖南军区政治部编的《民兵课本》也已付印。省文教厅、农林厅、中华全国科学技术普及协会湖南分会和几个文工团都在为出版社准备材料。
    第三个办法：编选工人、农民的作品；团结旧艺人、旧小说家进行创作。
    除了这些办法之外，总的方面还成立了编审工作委员会。
    采取与报社紧密合作，争取各有关机关帮助等办法，大体解决了编写的问题，编写出来的读物，并能够适合当前广大群众的需要。
  出什么？该怎样出？
    今天，新区群众中，什么地方，什么人是最迫切需要通俗读物的呢？广大农村中的农民。这就肯定：出版社必须真正面向农村。
    新区农民迫切需要的是什么呢？在他们宽广的兴趣中，最主要的还是通俗的政治读物，时事教育读物，特别是和他们血肉相连的土地改革运动、生产运动的有关读物（通俗文艺也需要，但还不是迫切需要的）。这样，我们就决定：出版物的比例中，读本必须占有百分之二十，一般政治时事读物必须占有百分之三十五，应用文百分之十，通俗文艺（包括各种文艺形式）占百分之三十五。（编者按：还应该出版一些农副业生产知识的读物和医药卫生知识的读物。）
    该怎样出呢？根据自己的力量，针对这些个需要，便采取“宁可少出一些种类，但要多销一些册数”的作法。多销，这就必须是为群众所喜爱，为群众所需要的。这样做，更可以避免盲目出版的现象，也不致积压冷货，囤死资金。
    印出的书，还必须使农民容易看，消化得了，携带方便，更要紧的是买得起。这就肯定：字要大（现在是用四号或老五号正楷），本儿要薄而小（一般是五十开本，顶多不超过四十面），价钱要便宜（已出书中，一册的最高价为七百元）。
  怎样把书发出去？
    书出来以后，怎样使他到达读者的手里呢？办法之一，是交邮局发行，由出版社直接联系。经理部门工作同志作过一些调查和了解的工作，决定要对边远县、书业不发达的县多下功夫。成绩证明：仅三万人口的湘西道县城，九十本试销书寄到邮局，一个下午便卖光了。单是邮局系统，每册书至少要承销一万五千册。
    对于私营书店是用各种办法鼓励畅销，在折扣上是公私兼顾；怕卖不出，可以先选一批书试销；怕卖不完，可以退书。现在，长沙市的私营书店，几乎全部是把通俗读物出版社的书籍摆在窗橱中的显著地位。事实也证明：没有什么存货可以退回，这些书不但可以销出，而且也可以销完。
    在城市中，还有一些小书贩也拿了这些通俗读物，到许多偏僻小巷去叫卖，这就更能深入群众。
    通俗读物的发行工作，同样是一件群众工作，不做好它，通俗读物就还只“通俗”一半。
  走对了方向，就有成绩！
    出版社成立，还刚满一百天。到四月十八日止，已出了九种通俗读物和一册《惩治反革命条例》，总发行数为五十六万五千册。其中宣传土地改革和农业生产的，有《土地改革读本》一、二、三册（已销三十三万册），《生产发家四字经》（已销四万册），《湖南农业四劳模》（已销两万册）；宣传婚姻法的有《婚姻自由歌》（已销四万册）；宣传时事的，有《两个世界》（已销二万五千册），《美帝怎样利用日本》（已销二万册），《苏联也有原子弹》（已销二万册）。《惩治反革命条例》也已销七万册。
    读者（特别是农民）是喜爱通俗读物的。出版社新书的广告一在大众报登出来，报社就收到不少请代买新书的信。各地邮局给出版社写信说：“这些书很受群众欢迎，我们销书的成绩非常好！”
    尽管资金是如此短少，人力是如此不足，但因为走对了方向，能和群众的需要紧紧结合，肯多想办法，所以就能够克服困难，取得一些成绩。
    湖南通俗读物出版社是这样充满着信心前进，现在正为争取今年全年出书七十种到八十种，发行三百五十万册到四百万册而努力工作。
