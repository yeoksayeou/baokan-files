　　The Banner of Safe Production in Coal Mines - The Shi Yuhai Team
　　Shi Yuhai is an experienced miner with twelve years of production experience. Since 1947, the team he leads has not had any casualties except for one work-related injury. This is remarkable in the Xi'an Coal Mine, where the tunnels are old, the coal is brittle, and the methane content is high. Therefore, the "Shi Yuhai Coal Mining Team" has become a name loved by workers throughout the Xi'an mining area. Last September, Shi Yuhai went to Beijing to participate in the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, saw Chairman Mao, and received a prize personally signed by Chairman Mao. Since then, the reputation of the Shi Yuhai team has become even more resounding. Now they have become the banner of safe production in the Northeast coal mines. After the Xi'an Coal Mine launched a campaign to promote the experience of the Shi Yuhai team last year, the production concept of "safety first" has been universally established among the workers in the entire mining area, and more than 130 advanced safe production teams and groups have emerged. This has greatly reduced accidents in the entire mining area. In 1950, accidents decreased by 75.6 percent compared to 1949, and casualties decreased by 56 percent. Last October, it even created an unprecedented record of no deaths in the entire mining area.
　　Why can the Shi Yuhai team have such good results? The main reason is that their team has the following characteristics.
　　　　　　One, abide by safety regulations and conduct regular safety education
　　"Without life, there is no way to produce!" This is Shi Yuhai's most profound experience in twelve years of mining life. He instills this experience into the hearts of every worker through regular publicity and education. Therefore, the biggest feature of their team is that the entire team attaches importance to safety work, and preventing accidents is like preventing enemies, never relaxing for a moment.
　　This feature is inseparable from Shi Yuhai's attention to conducting safety education for workers at any time in combination with the actual situation. For example, once, someone tied the air door with a rope for the convenience of pushing the cart; another new worker cut down the board of the top air door and wanted to use it as a table. Both of these things seriously affected ventilation. After Shi Yuhai noticed, he immediately investigated and used these two things to organize discussions on the importance of ventilation in the pit; the team leader and veteran workers explained the use of air doors, top air door panels, and other safety equipment in the pit. This not only educated the workers who made mistakes, but also educated everyone. For experienced veteran workers, he also often pays attention to dispelling the narrow empiricism of some of them and raising their vigilance.
　　They are very serious about abiding by safety regulations. They especially cherish the safety equipment and machinery in the pit. Some equipment, such as sprayers and rock dust sheds, are sometimes placed too low, hindering the pushing of carts. They move them carefully after obtaining the consent of safety personnel.
　　　　　　Two, accept the experience and lessons of others and improve the safety work of the team
　　The Shi Yuhai team not only pays attention to the safety issues of its own operations at all times, but also pays special attention to studying the safety experience of other places, often learning from others' experiences and improving the team's safety work through oral inquiries or reading newspapers. For example, in April last year, the Fuguo No. 2 Mine had a gas explosion accident that injured sixteen people. After inquiring, it was learned that it was because the gas observer was irresponsible, went down the pit without a gas detector, and did not go to the main working face during inspection, but just smelled it with his nose, resulting in gas combustion. The Shi Yuhai team held a meeting to study this accident. In addition to deciding to be particularly vigilant about the cause of this accident, they also accepted the suggestion of Wu Chengtian, the leader of the drilling team, to improve the method of checking gas and reduce the possibility of gas combustion.
　　　　　　Three, unity and mutual assistance, assigning tasks according to ability
　　Shi Yuhai is not only familiar with his own business, but also familiar with the technical abilities of each worker in the team. Therefore, he can assign tasks according to their abilities and assign them to work in appropriate places according to their abilities. For example, last April, sixteen new workers came, who didn't understand anything when they first came, so they were first assigned to filling and pulling coal chutes in safe places. After they understood the general safety production knowledge in the pit, they were reassigned to work. This avoids casualties caused by new workers not understanding the safety common sense in the pit.
　　Experienced veteran workers are experienced, flexible and skilled in operation, so they are often assigned to work in complex and changing places. Last April, the second-level recovery face of the sixth roadway bottom plate of the new recovery area of the Third Mine collapsed twice, and the situation was very critical. After democratic discussion, it was decided to assign Wu Chengtian and Shang Xianqi, two experienced veteran workers, to do it. As a result, not only were possible roof fall accidents avoided, but the coal mining task was successfully completed. With the enthusiastic help of veteran workers, the sixteen new workers in the team learned how to set off explosives, planing coal, and stacking sandbags in more than four months, and also cultivated two drill operators.

### 煤矿安全生产的旗帜—施玉海小组

　　煤矿安全生产的旗帜—施玉海小组
    施玉海是一个有十二年生产经验的老矿工。他领导的小组，从一九四七年到现在，除了一次公伤外，没有发生过伤亡事故。这在坑道古老、煤质酥脆、含瓦斯量又多的西安煤矿，是件了不起的事情。所以“施玉海采煤小组”就成为西安全矿区工人所爱戴的名字。去年九月，施玉海到北京参加了全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议，看见了毛主席，得到了毛主席亲笔签名的奖品。从此，施玉海小组的名声更加响亮。现在他们已成为东北煤矿安全生产的旗帜。去年西安煤矿开展推广施玉海小组经验的运动以后，在全矿区工友中普遍树立了“安全第一”的生产观点，出现了一百三十多个先进的安全生产班、组，使全矿区事故大减，一九五○年比一九四九年事故减少了百分之七十五点六，伤亡减少了百分之五十六，去年十月份更创造了全矿区未出死亡事故的空前纪录。
    施玉海小组为什么能有这样好的成绩呢？主要的因为他们小组有下面几个特点。
            一、遵守保安规程，经常进行保安教育
    “没命，就没法生产！”这是施玉海十二年矿坑生活最深刻的体验。他把这个体验，通过平时的宣传教育，贯输到每个工人的心里去。所以他们小组最大的一个特点是：全组重视安全工作，防备事故就像防备敌人一样，一刻也不放松。
    这个特点是和施玉海注意随时结合实际情况向工人进行保安教育分不开的。比如有一次，不知是谁为推车方便就用绳子把风门拴住了；又有个新工人把顶风门的板子割下来想当桌子用。这两件事都严重地影响了通风。施玉海察觉后，立刻追查，并拿这两件事组织讨论坑内通风的重要性；又由班组长和老工人，讲解风门、顶风门的木板，以及坑内其他保安设备的用处。这样不仅教育了犯错误的工人，也教育了大家。对于有经验的老工人，他也经常注意打消他们中间部分人的狭隘经验主义的思想，提高他们的警惕性。
    他们在遵守保安规程上是非常认真的。对坑内保安设备和机械等特别爱护。有些设备像喷雾器、岩粉棚子等，有时候放得低了，妨碍推车，他们都是在征得保安人员的同意后，再谨慎加以移动。
            二、接受别人经验教训，改进本组安全工作
    施玉海小组不仅时刻注意本组作业安全问题，而且对别处的安全经验也特别注意研究，常常通过口头询问或看报等方式，学习别人的经验，改进本组安全工作。如富国二坑去年四月曾发生了负伤十六人的瓦斯爆炸事故，经询问知道是因为瓦斯观测员工作不负责任，没有带瓦斯检定器就下了坑，检查时也没到大掌子去，只用鼻子闻一闻，结果引起瓦斯燃烧。施玉海小组开会研究了这次事故，除了决定对这次事故发生的原因要特别警惕外，并接受打眼小组组长吴成田的建议，改进了检查瓦斯的方法，减少了瓦斯燃烧的可能性。
            三、团结互助，量材分工
    施玉海不仅熟悉本身业务，而且他还熟悉本组每个工人的技术能力。因此能量材分工，按能力高低分配在适当的场所工作。比如去年四月新来十六名新工友，刚来啥也不懂，就把他们先分配到安全地方充填，扒拉煤溜子。等到懂得了坑内一般安全生产知识以后，再重新分配工作。这样就避免了新工人因不懂坑内保安常识而造成伤亡事故。
    老工人经验丰富，操作灵活熟练，所以多让他们到情况复杂、变化多的地方去工作。去年四月，三坑新回采区六路底板二层回采开掌子面，送了两次道都垮了台，情况很危急，经过民主讨论，就决定分配吴成田、尚先启两位有经验的老工人去做。结果不但避免了可能发生的冒顶事故，而且胜利地完成了采煤任务。该组十六名新工人在老工友热心帮助下，四个多月学会了放炮、刨镐、垒沙垛子，还培养出了两个打眼手。
