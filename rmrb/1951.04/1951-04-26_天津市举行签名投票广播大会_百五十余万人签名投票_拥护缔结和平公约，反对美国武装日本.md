    [Our newspaper's special dispatch from Tianjin this morning at 1 a.m.] Yesterday, from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m., the Tianjin People's Broadcasting Station held a broadcast rally for signing in support of the conclusion of a peace pact and voting against the American arming of Japan. Citizens widely listened to the broadcast and signed and voted on the spot, reaching 1,543,672 people. The rally began with an opening speech by Huang Songling, Chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association, followed by a speech by Huang Jing, Mayor of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government. Zhou Zhimin, a worker from the Tianjin Steel Plant, and Shen Laotaitai, the family member of a tricycle worker Shen Liyong who was killed by American imperialist troops, denounced the crimes of American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang. The rally, centered on the Tianjin People's Broadcasting Station, saw all municipal organs, people's organizations, factories, schools, and streets each with their own command posts, venues, and extensive masses. Large and small gatherings exchanged hatred for American imperialism. The Tianjin Branch of the National Railway Workers' Union organized over 12,000 people to listen. Nankai University gathered over 2,000 teachers and students. Eighteen units of the Municipal Trade Union Council organized 11,800 people to participate. The Import and Export Industry Association used telephones to connect with 25 listening groups. This signature campaign in support of the conclusion of a peace pact and voting broadcast rally against the American arming of Japan in Tianjin enthusiastically swept the people of the city into the movement to strive for peace.
    Yang Shuwen, a tricycle worker from Nanfu Fang, after listening to the accusations of the victims, recalled how Japanese devils rode in his car without paying him, and also beat him blind in one eye. He said, "I must sign and vote!" Listeners from the Tianjin Match Industry Association recalled the past devastation of the Tianjin match industry by the Japanese invaders, and they said: "We cannot allow our industry to be stopped again, we must vote on the Japanese issue." The broadcast rally maintained close contact with the people of the Yuanda District. The families of the New Harmony Materials Factory workers in the Tangda District listened to the broadcast and said, "The power of signing and voting is too great, one more signature is like one more person picking up a gun." Yang Dongping, the nephew of Shen Chong, who was insulted by American soldiers, also rushed to the People's Broadcasting Station to denounce them. The broadcast rally aroused the anger of the people, and the people of Tianjin unanimously expressed their determination to do their jobs well to strengthen the forces for peace. The steelworkers of the Central Heavy Industry Department's Tianjin Steel Plant completed their task four days ahead of schedule this month. Comrades from the Tianjin Journalists' Resist America, Aid Korea Rescue Committee and the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Health Bureau also participated in the rally. They decided to organize five Resist America, Aid Korea surgical teams to work at the front, including a volunteer medical service team of 1,760 people. Employees of Dagu Chemical Factory, Tanggu Haihe Engineering Office, Tangda Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Tanggu Railway Workers' Union have all adopted patriotic covenants, guaranteeing that every employee will promote signing and voting to citizens and their families. The broadcast rally also inspired the people's enthusiasm for loving the Chinese People's Volunteers. Listeners from the Import and Export Industry Association specially sent a representative, Wang Dihua, to speak at the broadcasting station, and donated 50 million yuan to慰劳the People's Volunteers. Yilicheng Tofu Shop in the west end of the Eighth District, after more than 40 workers listened to the broadcast, each voluntarily donated 5,000 yuan. All workers of the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau donated one day's wages to buy books for the soldiers on the Korean front.
