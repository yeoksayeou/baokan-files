    Suggest Trade Organizations Unify Tobacco Leaf Purchase and Sales
    To the Editor:
    Xiangling County in Shanxi Province is a tobacco-producing area. Recently, the simultaneous rush to purchase tobacco leaves in the county by both the Industry Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government and the Linfen Native Produce Company has created market chaos. To avoid the recurrence of this phenomenon, I suggest it is best to implement unified purchase and sales of tobacco leaves.
    Since the beginning of spring, the Linfen Native Produce Company, due to allocation tasks, entrusted the local exchange to purchase tobacco leaves. Coincidentally, the Xiangling Purchasing Office of the Industry Department also entrusted the Xiangling County Supply and Marketing Cooperative to make purchases at the same time. In order to avoid inconsistent purchase prices, the Native Produce Company consulted with the Xiangling Purchasing Office of the Industry Department to agree on a unified purchase price (7,000 yuan per jin for standard tobacco leaves). The Purchasing Office and the Xiangling County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, anxious to complete their purchase tasks, arbitrarily allowed peddlers to quote prices out of order. Some peddlers passed off third-grade tobacco leaves as second-grade, and even mixed seven or eight jin of bad leaves into one bundle. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative also entrusted the weighing, accounting, and cashier work to the peddlers, resulting in some peddlers colluding with each other, falsely reporting high prices, and sharing the profits. This not only increased the difficulty of the Native Produce Company's purchases (as the Native Produce Company's purchase of tobacco leaves is mainly for export, the quality requirements are higher), but also caused market disorder.
    I believe that the Xiangling Purchasing Office and the Xiangling County Supply and Marketing Cooperative's practice of relying solely on peddlers for purchases, without going through the organization of cooperatives, is inappropriate. Moreover, allowing out-of-order price quotations without principle, undermining unified standards, and disrupting the market is even more wrong.
    Therefore, I suggest that trade organizations should implement unified purchase and sales of tobacco leaves (similar to the unified purchase and sales of cotton yarn); if conditions are not yet ripe, a joint purchase method can be implemented first in individual specialty product areas, in order to minimize the confusion in purchasing.

### 建议贸易机构统一购销烟叶

专栏：来信摘要

    建议贸易机构统一购销烟叶编辑同志：
    山西襄陵县是烟叶产区。最近因山西省人民政府工业厅和临汾土产公司同时在该县抢购烟叶，造成了市场上的紊乱现象。为避免这种现象继续发生，我建议最好实行烟叶的统购统销。
    入春以来，临汾土产公司因有调拨任务，曾委托当地交易所收购烟叶；工业厅襄陵收购处亦恰于此时委托襄陵县供销社进行收购。为了避免发生收购中价格不统一的现象，土产公司曾与工业厅襄陵收购处商订统一收购价格（标准烟叶每斤七千元）。该收购处与襄陵县供销社因急于完成收购任务，便擅自允许小贩们越级报价，有的小贩以三等烟叶充作二等出售，甚至一捆烟叶里掺有七八斤坏叶子。供销社并将列秤、算账、出纳等工作委托小贩管理，结果在收购中发生某些小贩互相串通、虚报高价，共同分利的事情。这样，既增加了土产公司收购的困难（因土产公司采购烟叶主要是为了出口，故对质量的要求较高），又造成了市场上的秩序紊乱。
    我认为襄陵收购处与襄陵供销社不通过合作社的组织，只依靠小贩收购的做法是不妥的；无原则地任其越级报价，破坏统一标准，扰乱市场的行为更是不对的。
    因此，我建议贸易机构应对烟叶实行统购、统销（如花纱布的统购、统销）；如条件不够成熟，则可在个别特产地区先实行联购办法，以期尽量减少采购中的混乱现象。
                                           郭瑛、周国瑜
