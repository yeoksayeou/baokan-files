    Taiyuan Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau
    Self-Criticism Regarding Refusal to Allocate Trade Union Funds to新生 Building Company

    To the Editors:
    Comrade Wang Guilin's criticism in the "Reader's Letters" section of your newspaper on March 21st, regarding the refusal of 新生 Building Company, under our bureau's leadership, to allocate trade union funds, is something we have examined and on which we offer the following self-criticism:

    新生 Building Company has indeed failed to allocate trade union funds according to the Trade Union Law in relation to military and municipal engineering projects. The reason for this is that when the bureau prepared the budget for municipal engineering projects last year, trade union funds were not included, so the company had no way to disburse them. This is a fact. After this review, the trade union funds that should have been allocated last year have now been retroactively allocated from this year's municipal funds. Another part of the project was not settled until March of this year, so the trade union funds were not allocated in a timely manner last year; they were all paid on April 3rd.

    The main reasons for these errors are, on the one hand, that the Construction Bureau's leadership was not thorough or meticulous enough, and the budgets that should have been prepared were not prepared in a timely manner; on the other hand, 新生 Building Company did not pay enough attention to this matter and did not actively study solutions. This shows that we have not been serious enough in implementing the Trade Union Law. We have now conducted a serious review among the cadres of 新生 Building Company to ensure that such illegal incidents do not happen again.

### 太原市人民政府建设局  对新生建筑公司拒拨工会经费的检讨

    太原市人民政府建设局
    对新生建筑公司拒拨工会经费的检讨编辑同志：
    王桂林同志三月二十一日在贵报《读者来信专页》上对我局领导的公营新生建筑公司拒绝拨缴工会经费提出批评。对此，我们作如下检讨：
    新生建筑公司在军事与市政工程方面是没有依工会法拨缴工会经费的。市政工程在去年本局编造预算时，没有把工会经费编造进去，所以公司没法开支，这是事实，经这次检查后，始由今年的市政经费内补拨了去年应拨的工会经费。另一部分工程，也由于迟至今年三月才结账，故去年没有及时拨缴工会经费；现已于四月三日一并缴清。
    发生这些错误的主要原因，一方面是建设局的领导不够深入、细致，应当编造的预算没有及时编造；另一方面，新生建筑公司对这件事也不够重视，没有主动研究解决办法。这说明我们对工会法的执行还不够认真。现在我们已在新生建筑公司的干部中，认真作了检查，以使此类违法事件不再发生。
              太原市人民政府建设局
