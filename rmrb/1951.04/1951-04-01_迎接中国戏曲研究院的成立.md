　　Welcoming the Establishment of the Chinese Academy of Chinese Opera
    Chinese Academy of Chinese Opera President Mei Lanfang
    In order to strengthen the research and experimentation of opera art, improve the creative level of opera art, and cultivate the next generation of new opera talents, the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government has decided to merge part of the editing and research work of the original Opera Improvement Bureau with the New Folk Art Experimental Mobile Group, the Opera Experimental School, and the Peking Opera Research Institute, and reorganize it into the Chinese Academy of Chinese Opera.
    The basic tasks of the Chinese Academy of Chinese Opera are defined as follows:
    (1) Select excellent old opera scripts, organize and revise them, and write new scripts and lyrics to ensure the necessary supply and gradually overcome the script shortage and the anarchic state of opera performances.
    (2) In order to build a patriotic people's opera cause, conduct research and experimentation on opera art in a focused, systematic, and integrated manner, and sort out experience from practice for promotion.
    (3) Strengthen patriotic people's opera education work, plan for the long term, use scientific methods, and systematically cultivate the younger generation of opera work cadres.
    The Chinese Academy of Chinese Opera was established following Chairman Mao's guiding principle of "weeding through the old to bring forth the new," inheriting the glorious tradition of the Yan'an Peking Opera Theater and the Peking Opera Research Institute of the Central Opera Improvement Bureau, as well as research and education work related to opera art. Historical experience has painfully told us that such a thing would have been absolutely impossible in the old society. That is to say, if it were not for the era of Mao Zedong, if it were not for the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government's attention and support for the people's opera cause, the establishment of the Chinese Academy of Chinese Opera would have been absolutely impossible. In terms of the significance of research and development of opera art, this should be regarded as a major event in the history of Chinese opera revolution and even cultural history, which deserves the unanimous excitement of our opera comrades! Personally, I am deeply honored to be so relied upon by the state, allowing me and comrades Cheng Yanqiu, Luo Heru, and Ma Shaobo to jointly take charge of the leadership work of the academy! As the proverb says, "Diligence can make up for clumsiness." Facing such a glorious and arduous task, we can only redouble our efforts to study, work with an extremely modest, prudent, serious, and responsible spirit, and with an attitude of close integration of theory and practice, and contribute all our meager strength to the country and the people, and to the cause of opera improvement.

　　迎接中国戏曲研究院的成立
    中国戏曲研究院院长  梅兰芳
    为了加强戏曲艺术的研究与实验工作，提高戏曲艺术的创作水平，和培养下一代新的戏曲人材起见，中央人民政府文化部决定将原戏曲改进局的一部分编审工作与研究工作和新曲艺实验流动小组、戏曲实验学校与京剧研究院合并，改组为中国戏曲研究院。
    中国戏曲研究院的基本任务是这样确定的：
    （一）选定旧有戏曲优良脚本，进行整理修改，并编写新剧本、新曲词，以保证必要的供应，逐渐克服剧本荒及戏曲上演的无政府状态。
    （二）为建设爱国主义的人民戏曲事业，在戏曲艺术方面有重点地、较系统地、并互相结合地进行研究实验工作，并从实践中整理经验，予以推广。
    （三）加强爱国主义的人民戏曲教育工作，往长远打算，用科学方法，有计划地培养戏曲工作干部的青年一代。
    中国戏曲研究院是遵循了毛主席“推陈出新”的指针，承继了延安京剧院和中央戏曲改进局的京剧研究院及有关戏曲艺术的研究、教育工作的光荣传统而成立的。历史的经验已经痛切地告诉了我们，在旧社会，绝不可能有这样的事实，就是说，假如不是在毛泽东的时代，假如不是中国共产党与人民政府重视与支持人民戏曲事业，中国戏曲研究院的成立是绝对不可能的。就戏曲艺术的研究发展的意义说来，应该认为这是中国戏曲革命史以至文化史上的一桩重大的事件，值得我们戏曲界的战友们一致兴奋！在我个人，蒙国家如此倚重，让我和程砚秋、罗合如、马少波诸位同志共同负责院的领导工作，深深引为荣幸！谚云：“勤能补拙”，面对着这样光荣而又艰巨的任务，惟有倍加振奋，努力学习，以极其虚心、谨慎、严肃、负责的精神，以理论与实践紧密结合的态度，从事工作，把自己一点微薄的力量，全部贡献给国家和人民，贡献给戏曲改进事业。
