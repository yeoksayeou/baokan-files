    Difficulties for Northern Jiangsu Farmers in Raising Pigs
    To the Editor:
    In our Northern Jiangsu region, pig manure is the primary fertilizer for farmland. Using soybean cake as fertilizer for dry land is far less effective than pig manure. Raising pigs is also a major sideline occupation for our farmers and a good way to accumulate wealth. However, at present, many farmers in our Northern Jiangsu region lack the capital to raise pigs and cannot afford piglets. This is the first difficulty in raising pigs. Secondly, there are also difficulties in selling the pigs. Although the People's Government has established state-owned pig trading houses in various towns, they have not penetrated into the countryside, and the purchase price of the state-owned pig trading houses is lower than that of private merchants. If farmers sell pigs to private merchants, sometimes the private merchants delay payment for months or even years, and the farmers cannot get cash, which is still a loss. Therefore, our farmers hope that the government can lend some money as capital for raising pigs, and also hope that local cooperatives will purchase farmers' pigs locally.

    Editor's Note: Last year, the Northern Jiangsu region suffered a severe drought, and some farmers lacked production funds, making it difficult to raise pigs or engage in other sideline occupations. This problem should first be addressed during the distribution of victory fruits in the land reform; the state financial and trade organs in the Northern Jiangsu region should also help farmers solve this problem as much as possible.

### 苏北农民养猪有困难

    苏北农民养猪有困难编辑同志：
    在我们苏北地区猪粪是农田的主要肥料。旱田用豆饼作肥料远不及猪粪有力。养猪又是我们农民的主要副业和集累财富的好办法。但是目前我们苏北地区的很多农民都缺乏养猪的资本，买不起小猪，这是养猪的第一个困难。其次，在猪的销路上也有困难。人民政府虽然在各城镇设立了公营猪行，但都没有深入农村，公营猪行的买价又低于私贩。农民把猪卖给私贩罢，有时私贩成年累月的拖延付款，农民拿不到现款，还是吃亏。因此我们农民们盼望着政府能贷给一些钱做养猪的本钱，并且还希望各地合作社就地收买农民的猪。

    编者按：去年苏北地区曾遭受严重灾荒，一部分农民缺乏生产资金，养猪或进行其他副业都有困难。这个问题，首先应该在土地改革中分配胜利果实时注意解决；苏北地区的国家金融贸易机关，也应该尽可能地帮助农民解决这一问题。
