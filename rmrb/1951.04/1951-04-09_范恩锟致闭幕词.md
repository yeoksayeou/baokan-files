　　Comrades Leaders, honored guests, esteemed priests, and fellow Catholics:

　　The Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association has been officially established today, filling us Catholics with boundless excitement and encouragement.

　　Listening to the speeches of the priests and fellow Catholics just now has given us an even clearer understanding of the imperialists' conspiracy to use religion to engage in aggression and sabotage against us. Therefore, we feel that the Catholic reform movement has become even more urgent. Although the imperialists are still trying every possible means to undermine us, and this struggle is still very arduous, we believe that with the support of the people of the whole country and the support of all patriotic Catholics, the Catholic reform movement will surely achieve final victory.

　　For many years, the imperialist elements within the church have deceived us with the fallacies of religion being "above politics" and "above international affairs," telling us not to ask about politics and to blindly obey. In reality, they have slapped themselves in the face. Recently, many cases of American imperialist espionage cracked by our government are related to them, such as Bu Xiangxian, Fang Ruhui, Bao Yihua, etc., who are their representatives. Today, we have deeply realized the truth that without a motherland, there is no Catholicism. Our reform movement is completely correct, which is not only patriotic but also a concrete manifestation of loving the church. However, our current awakening is only a beginning, and there is still much arduous work waiting for us. Therefore, we must redouble our efforts and strengthen ourselves. First of all, we must thoroughly expose the conspiracies of all saboteurs, severely suppress imperialist elements, continue to carry forward the anti-imperialist patriotic spirit, and strive to study current affairs. We must strengthen unity, correctly understand the enemy and ourselves, prevent the enemy from sowing discord, and be good Catholics who love the country and love the church. We must resolutely sever ties with imperialism, hold high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-aggression, establish an independent church, seize control of ecclesiastical power, and strive to realize our own management plan. Self-governance, self-propagation, and self-support will surely be successful.

　　We have confidence that the reform movement of us Catholics will surely achieve final victory. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will transform the Catholic Church, which has been controlled by imperialism, into a church of our own people, and it will grow healthily along with the increasing strength of New China, with a bright future ahead.

　　范恩锟致闭幕词各位首长、各位来宾、各位神长、各位教友：
    天津市天主教革新运动促进会今天正式成立了，我们天主教徒感到无限的兴奋和鼓舞。
    方才听了各位神长和教友的讲话，使我们更加清楚地认识了帝国主义利用宗教从事侵略与破坏我们的阴谋；因此，我们觉得天主教的革新运动就更加成为急不可待的事情了。虽然帝国主义还在千方万计的破坏我们，这场斗争还很艰苦；但我们相信：在全国人民的支持下，在全体爱国教友的支持下，天主教的革新运动一定是可以取得最后胜利的。
    多年来教内帝国主义分子一直以宗教“超政治”、“超国际”的谰言欺骗我们，叫我们不问政治，叫我们盲目服从，其实他们自己就打了自己的嘴巴。最近我们政府破获的许多美帝国主义间谍案件，很多是与他们有关系的，如卜相贤、房如晦、鲍翊华等就是他们的代表。今天我们已深深认识到没有祖国就没有天主教的真理。我们的革新运动是完全正确的，这不仅是爱国也是爱教的具体表现。但是，我们现在的觉醒只不过是个开端，还有许多很艰巨的工作在等待着我们；因此，我们必须加倍努力，加强自己。首先我们要彻底揭发一切破坏分子的阴谋，严厉镇压帝国主义分子，要继续发扬反帝的爱国精神，努力学习时事。要加强团结，正确地认识敌我，防止敌人挑拨，做一个爱国爱教的好教友。要坚决割断和帝国主义的联系，将反帝反侵略的大旗高举起来，建立自主的教会，掌握了教权，努力实现自己经营计划。自治、自传、自养，一定是可以成功的。
    我们是有信心的，我们天主教徒的革新运动必然获得最后胜利，我们要在毛主席的领导下，使为帝国主义所把持的天主教会成为人民自己的教会，并随着新中国的日益强大而健康起来，前途光芒万丈。
