Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 21st: The American imperialists' intensified efforts to pursue a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan, attempting to expand the aggressive war, have aroused strong opposition from people of all circles in Korea.

Hyun Heon, Chairman of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, said: Due to the failure of the aggressive war in Korea, the weakness of the American imperialists' insufficient troop strength has been further exposed. Therefore, it wants to tear up international agreements, set aside China and the Soviet Union, and conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, rearming Japan in order to turn Japan into an American base of aggression and the Japanese people into its cannon fodder for aggression, thereby expanding the aggressive war. This conspiracy of American imperialism completely violates the interests of the Korean and Chinese people, as well as the Japanese people. The entire Korean people, led by the working class, absolutely cannot tolerate it. We resolutely support the solemn statements repeatedly issued by the Chinese and Soviet governments on the issue of concluding a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, and will launch a more courageous struggle to thoroughly crush this criminal conspiracy of American imperialism.

Kim Si-jae, Vice Chairman of the Korean Farmers' League, said: Whenever the mortal enemy of our nation—Japanese imperialism—is mentioned, every Korean hates it to the core. Before the "August 15th" Liberation, 62 percent of all land in Korea was controlled by Japanese landlords and pro-Japanese traitors, who only accounted for 3 percent of the total number of farmers. Korean farmers lived a slave life worse than that of animals. Korean farmers, who have now become masters of the land, will never allow the American aggressors to re-establish the Japanese militarist forces to enslave us again. Korean farmers will work even harder on this year's production front, promote the final victory of the Fatherland Liberation War, and make it impossible for the American imperialists' sinister conspiracy to expand the war to ever be realized.

Lee Geum-sun, Vice Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's League, said: Korean women suffered all kinds of inhuman oppression and humiliation during the thirty-six years of Japanese rule. Today, as the American imperialist bandits are suffering heavy blows from the Korean and Chinese People's forces, they want to rearm Japan in order to expand the war of aggression against Korea, which will bring greater disasters and misfortunes to Korean women and children. All of us Korean women certainly resolutely oppose it.

Kim So-jin, Chairman of the Korean Democratic Youth League, said: All Korean youth resolutely oppose the American aggressors' conspiracy to pursue a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan. In the war of aggression against Korea, the American bandits have long used Japanese mercenaries, and Japan has long become an American base of aggression and an arsenal. However, in the past, American imperialism only did this secretly. Today, because it has suffered one shameful defeat after another, it is attempting to openly tear up international agreements, pursue a separate peace treaty with Japan, and massively rearm Japan in an attempt to expand the war of aggression against Korea. The people of the world are opposing this illegal act by American imperialism. In particular, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance strongly guarantees peace and security in Asia. The American imperialists' conspiracy to rearm Japan and expand aggression will inevitably be thoroughly bankrupted in the face of the people of all of Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: According to a United Press report: The Japanese Labor-Farmer Party issued an open letter on March 26th, based on the resolution of the party's Second Congress, expressing opposition to a separate peace treaty that leads to war. The open letter stated: Concluding a peace treaty with Japan through separate peace talks and rearmament will not only cause Japan to lose its independence and peace, but will also sharpen international opposition and deepen the crisis of a new war. The letter declared: The Labor-Farmer Party cannot agree to a separate peace treaty, and the public opinion of the Japanese people also shows that they absolutely oppose this form of peace treaty with Japan that leads to war.

　　坚决拥护中苏两国对日全面缔和主张
　  朝鲜人民反对美国武装日本
　  日本劳农党发表公开信反对单独媾和
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】美帝国主义加紧进行单独对日媾和与重新武装日本，企图扩大侵略战争的阴谋，已引起朝鲜各界人民的强烈反对。
    朝鲜职业总同盟委员长玄勋说：由于侵略朝鲜战争的失败，美帝国主义兵力不足的弱点更加暴露了。因此，它想撕毁国际协定，撇开中、苏两大国，单独对日媾和，重新武装日本，以便把日本变成美国的侵略基地，把日本人民当作它的侵略炮灰，扩大侵略战争。美帝国主义这一阴谋，完全违反朝、中两国人民以及日本人民的利益。以工人阶级为首的全朝鲜人民，绝对不能容忍。我们坚决拥护中、苏两国政府就缔结全面对日和约问题屡次发表的严正声明，并将展开更勇敢的战斗，来彻底粉碎美帝国主义这一罪恶阴谋。
    朝鲜农民同盟副委员长金时哉说：一提起我们民族不共戴天之仇——日本帝国主义来，没有一个朝鲜人不切齿痛恨的。在“八、一五”解放前，全朝鲜百分之六十二的土地，掌握在只占全国农户百分之三的日本地主和朝奸手中。朝鲜农民过着牛马不如的奴隶生活。已经变成土地的主人的朝鲜农民，决不能允许美国侵略者重新扶植日本军国主义势力再来奴役我们。朝鲜农民将在今年的生产战线上，更加努力，促进祖国解放战争的最后胜利，使美帝国主义扩大战争的罪恶阴谋永远无法实现。
    朝鲜民主妇女同盟副委员长李金顺说：朝鲜妇女在日寇三十六年的统治时期中，受尽了一切非人的压迫和凌辱。今天，当美帝国主义强盗遭到朝、中人民部队的沉重打击时，又要重新武装日本，以便扩大侵朝战争，势将给朝鲜妇女和儿童带来更大的灾难和不幸。我们全朝鲜妇女当然坚决反对。
    朝鲜民主青年同盟委员长金琐镇说：全朝鲜青年坚决反对美国侵略者单独对日媾和与重新武装日本的阴谋。在侵朝战争中，美国强盗早已使用了日本雇佣兵，日本早已变成了美国的侵略基地和军火库。但是，过去美帝国主义只是偷偷摸摸地这样做。今天，由于它遭到一次又一次的可耻失败，竟企图公然撕毁国际协定，单独对日媾和，大规模地重新武装日本，以图扩大侵朝战争。全世界人民都在反对美帝国主义这一非法行为，特别是中、苏两大国的友好同盟互助条约，强有力地保障了亚洲的和平与安全。美帝国主义重新武装日本扩大侵略的阴谋，在全亚洲人民的面前，必然要遭到彻底的破产。
    【新华社二十一日讯】据联合通讯社消息：日本劳农党曾于三月二十六日发表公开信，根据该党第二次大会的决议，表示反对导向战争的单独媾和。公开信说：以单独媾和与重新武装的方式促成对日和约的缔结，不但将使日本丧失独立与和平，并将使国际间的对立更加尖锐，加深新战争的危机。该信宣称：劳农党不能同意单独媾和，日本人民大众的舆论也表明他们绝对反对这种导向战争的对日媾和方式。
