  Shanghai Holds Spring Festival Opera Competition
    The Shanghai 1951 Spring Festival Opera and Ballad Competition, lasting one month, has successfully concluded. The Shanghai Spring Festival Opera and Ballad Competition Judging Committee awarded six honorary prizes on March 24th. In opera, there were four works: "Good Sons and Daughters" (滬劇, Shanghai Opera), "The Beauty Trap" (淮劇, Huai Opera), "Yue Fei" (淮劇, Huai Opera), and "Fifteen Episodes of Water Margin" (京劇, Beijing Opera serial). In ballad singing, there were two works: "The Taiping Rebellion" (評話, Pinghua storytelling) and "Three Times on the Sedan Chair" (弹词, Tanci ballad).
    These six operas, in addition to possessing the common characteristics of this year's Spring Festival performances—improvement in performance level, a serious and conscientious attitude towards work, and enthusiastic welcome from the audience—also prominently and closely cooperated with current political tasks, promoted patriotism, rapidly and directly reflected reality, and helped the audience gain a further understanding of the current situation. For example, the Shanghai Opera "Good Sons and Daughters" tells the patriotic story of two young men and women from Northeast China who joined the volunteer army and medical team, respectively, and met on the Korean battlefield. In terms of performance form, they all utilized the characteristics of their respective opera genres. The two Pingtan ballads, in addition to utilizing the original advantages of the Pingtan art, also broke through the original singing style of Pingtan and made new creations.
    In addition to the above six honorary awards, although the Yue Opera "Lord Xinling," which played a considerable role in singing patriotic operas during the Spring Festival, and the slapstick comedy "Living Buddha," which had been running for the second year and had undergone good revisions to the script, as well as new storytelling by "Li Chuang Wang" (Huang Yian), "Xiao Erhei Gets Married" (Liu Tianshao, etc.), "Nine Pieces of Clothing" (Xu Xueyue, etc.), and "Wu Song" (Yang Zhenxiong), etc., which did not participate in the competition, were also given special awards.

In addition to performing new and old dramas, these propaganda teams also extensively adopted folk art forms that were popular with the masses, such as flower drums, lotus flutes, colorful lotus boats, money boards, drawing lottery tickets, mountain songs, and storytelling, using Resist America, Aid Korea, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, land reform, and production and construction as the main content for propaganda, which was enthusiastically welcomed by the masses and powerfully promoted the propaganda and education work of Resist America, Aid Korea.

    上海市一九五一年春节戏曲曲艺竞赛历时一月，已胜利结束。该市春节戏曲曲艺竞赛评奖委员会于三月二十四日评定了荣誉奖六部。戏曲方面有《好儿女》（沪剧），《美人计》（淮剧），《岳飞》（淮剧），《十五本水泊梁山》（京剧连台本）四部；曲艺方面有《太平天国》（评话），《三上轿》（弹词）两部。
    这六部戏曲，除了具备今年春节演出的普遍特点——演出水平的提高、工作态度的严肃认真及受到观众的热烈欢迎外，它们还比较突出地紧密地配合当前的政治任务，发扬了爱国主义精神，迅速而直接地反映了现实，帮助观众对目前形势有了进一步的认识。如沪剧《好儿女》就是写东北的两个爱国男女青年，分别参加志愿部队和医疗队，在朝鲜战场上会师的爱国故事。在演出形式上都发挥了各该剧种的特点。其中两部评弹，除发挥了评弹艺术的原有优点，还突破了评弹原来的弹唱方式，有了新创造。
    除了上面六个荣誉奖外，虽然没有参加竞赛，但对春节演唱爱国主义戏曲起了相当作用的越剧《信陵公子》，和演出进入第二年，对剧本作了很好修改的滑稽戏《活菩萨》及《李闯王》（黄异庵），《小二黑结婚》（刘天韶等），《九件衣》（徐雪月等），《武松》（杨振雄）等新书说唱者，也给予特别奖。
