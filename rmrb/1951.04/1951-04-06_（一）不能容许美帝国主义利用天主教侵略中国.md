　　(I) American Imperialism Must Not Be Allowed to Use Catholicism to Invade China
    The Catholic Reform Movement, gradually unfolding under the great patriotic call to Resist America, Aid Korea, has increasingly and powerfully awakened the national consciousness of Catholics, enabling them to resolutely sever ties with imperialist elements. The Tianjin Public Security Bureau, accepting the just demands of teachers and students of Tientsin University and Catholic believers, arrested the American spies Bu Xiangxian, Bao Yihua, and Fang Ruhui. This is a concrete manifestation of Catholics assisting the government in eliminating counter-revolutionaries out of love for the country and the Church in the context of the deepening Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.
    Bu Xiangxian was the president of the Tianjin branch of the Catholic Jesuit Order, and Bao and Fang were both Catholic priests. They wore the cloak of Catholicism but actually served American imperialism to undermine the Chinese people's liberation cause. American imperialism, using these Catholics just as it uses the Vatican, regarded Catholicism as a tool for carrying out its aggressive conspiracies. The arrest of criminals like Bu Xiangxian forcefully exposed the fallacies spread by certain imperialist elements within Catholicism, who claimed that Catholicism is "supra-national," "supra-political," and "has no connection with imperialism, therefore there is no need to sever ties," and so on. This American spy case within Catholicism, uncovered in Tianjin, completely revealed the essence of these reactionary arguments. Their so-called "supra-national" simply means acting as spies for American imperialism regardless of nationality, which is a great insult to patriotic Catholics. In the past, the People's Government has captured many such "supra-national" spies, and now it has captured "supra-national" spies like Bu Xiangxian, all of whom wear the legal cloak of Catholicism to carry out destructive activities in China. Isn't this exactly what they call "supra-national"? The so-called "supra-political" is also easy to understand. No one with common sense could interpret the espionage activities carried out by Bu Xiangxian, the president of the Tianjin branch of the Catholic Jesuit Order, as "supra-political." These criminals gathered intelligence, sabotaged land reform, undermined the Marriage Law, slandered the People's Government, and acted as accomplices for American imperialism, engaging in destructive activities whenever possible. They neither "transcended" the destruction of China's politics nor "transcended" serving American imperialism's politics; on the contrary, they wholeheartedly participated in reactionary political activities. "Supra-political" is just a tattered fig leaf. Then look at the so-called "no connection with imperialism." May we ask, which of these American spies from the Catholic Church arrested in Tianjin has no connection with imperialism? These villains contacted the former Tianjin U.S. military headquarters, supplied intelligence to the U.S. imperialist's intelligence agency—the Army Strategic Intelligence Division, sabotaged the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, claiming that the "Holy Mother" "manifested" to the American invading army in Korea, undermined the Catholic Reform Movement, and slandered patriotic believers as "apostates" and "devils." Isn't all of this the connection they had with American imperialism? Moreover, this was not an ordinary connection, but a secret connection, a connection for espionage work, a connection through spy radio stations. Is there any more shameful connection than this criminal connection? Given this, the purpose of imperialist elements in creating this set of reactionary arguments is obvious. They fear Chinese Catholics severing ties with them, because in doing so, they will lose an important foothold in China. The sheepskin and the legal Catholic mask worn by the pawns they send to China will be peeled off, revealing their true identity as spies, and they will be intolerable to the people. Isn't that right? Once patriotic Catholics at Tientsin University severed ties with imperialism, they rose up to denounce spy villains like Bu Xiangxian. This righteous action of patriotic Catholics is by no means what they call "apostasy." It is these patriotic Catholics who helped the motherland eliminate an American spy nest and powerfully supported the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement; it is these patriotic Catholics who have upheld the dignity of Catholicism and helped the Chinese Catholic Church expel such dregs, and are therefore good believers. Every patriotic Catholic in the country should learn from the patriotic believers at Tientsin University, be a good citizen and a good believer, constantly and vigilantly watch the activities of imperialist elements hidden within Catholicism, denounce them, expose their crimes of harming the Chinese people, and thus harming Catholicism, so that their counter-revolutionary tricks have nowhere to be applied. Let all patriotic Catholics in China become aware, unite, and thoroughly smash the American imperialist's sinister plot to use Catholicism for espionage activities!

　　（一）不能容许美帝国主义利用天主教侵略中国
    在抗美援朝伟大的爱国主义号召下逐渐开展起来的天主教革新运动，已日渐有力地唤起了天主教徒的民族觉醒，使他们毅然地斩断同帝国主义分子的联系。天津市公安局接受津沽大学师生与天主教徒的正义要求，逮捕美国间谍卜相贤、鲍翊华、房如晦，便是在抗美援朝运动深入情形下天主教徒协助政府肃清反革命之爱国爱教的具体表现。
    卜相贤是天主教耶稣会天津院院长，鲍、房两犯也都是天主教的神甫。他们披着天主教外衣，实际上替美帝国主义服务来破坏中国人民的解放事业。美帝国主义利用这些天主教徒正如同利用梵蒂冈一样，把天主教作为它进行侵略阴谋的工具。卜相贤等犯的被捕，有力地揭破了某些帝国主义分子在天主教中散布的谬论，他们说什么天主教是“超国际”的，“超政治”的，“和帝国主义没有联系，因此也无所谓割断联系”等等。这次天津破获的天主教美国间谍案件，完全揭露了这些反动论调之本质。他们所说的“超国际”，只是不分国籍地给美帝国主义作特务，这真是对爱国天主教徒的莫大污辱。过去人民政府抓住过不少这种“超国际”的特务，现在又抓住了卜相贤这样“超国际”的特务，而他们都是披着天主教的合法外衣来在中国进行破坏勾当的。难道这不就是他们所说的“超国际”吗？所谓“超政治”，也是清楚易解的，每一个有常识的人，都不可能把天主教耶稣会天津院院长卜相贤等所进行的特务活动，解释成为“超政治”的。这些罪犯作情报、破坏土地改革、破坏婚姻法、诬蔑人民政府、为美帝国主义帮凶，只要有可能，他们就进行破坏活动。他们既没有“超”破坏中国之政治，也没有“超”为美帝国主义服务之政治；恰恰相反，他们死心塌地地参与着反动的政治活动。“超政治”不过是一块破烂不堪的遮羞布而已。再看所谓“和帝国主义没有联系”。请问，天津逮捕的这几个天主教美国间谍，有那一个与帝国主义没有联系呢？这几个匪类，和前天津美军司令部联系，给美帝国主义的特务机关——陆军战略情报处供给情报，破坏抗美援朝运动，说什么“圣母”给在朝鲜的美国侵略军“显圣”，破坏天主教革新运动，诬蔑爱国教徒为“叛教”，“魔鬼”，所有这一切，不就是他们和美帝国主义所进行的联系吗？而且这还不是一般的联系，而是秘密的联系，特务工作的联系，特务电台的联系。是不是还有比这种罪恶联系更可耻的呢？既然如此，帝国主义分子制造这套反动论调的目的就昭然若揭了。他们畏惧中国的天主教徒和他们割断联系，因为这一来，他们就在中国失去了一个重要立足之点，他们派来中国的走卒披的那张羊皮，戴的那副天主教的合法面具，就会被剥掉，露出了他们特务的本相，他们就要被人民所不容。不是吗？津沽大学的爱国天主教徒，一经与帝国主义割断联系，就纷起检举像卜相贤这样的特务匪类。爱国天主教徒的这种正义行动，也决不是如像他们所说的是什么“叛教”，正是这些爱国的天主教徒，帮助祖国扫除了一个美国特务巢穴，有力地支持了抗美援朝运动；正是这些爱国的天主教徒，才维护了天主教的尊严，帮助中国天主教驱除了这样的败类，因而是好的教徒。全国的每一个爱国天主教徒，都应该学习津沽大学的爱国教徒，作一个好公民，好教徒，时时刻刻警惕地注视着隐藏在天主教内的帝国主义分子的活动，检举他们，揭发他们危害中国人民，因而也是危害天主教的罪行，使他们的反革命伎俩无所施。全中国爱国的天主教徒觉悟起来，团结起来，彻底粉碎美帝国主义利用天主教进行特务活动的罪恶阴谋！
