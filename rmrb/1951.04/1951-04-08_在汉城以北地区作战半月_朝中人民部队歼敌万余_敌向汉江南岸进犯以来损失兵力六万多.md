Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 7th: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continue to fight bravely against the invading American, British, and other countries' aggressor troops and the Syngman Rhee puppet army in the area north of Seoul to the vicinity of the 38th parallel. From March 15th to March 31st, they annihilated more than 10,000 enemy troops. Thus, since the enemy launched an offensive towards the south bank of the Han River on January 25th, they have suffered a total loss of over 60,000 troops, of which more than 30,000 were American troops eliminated. At the beginning of this offensive, MacArthur greatly boasted about his tactic of "using mobile warfare to deplete the enemy's (referring to the Korean and Chinese People's Forces) strength." However, the facts have proven that it is not the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers who have suffered heavy losses, but precisely the American aggressor troops and their accomplices themselves.

　　在汉城以北地区作战半月
　  朝中人民部队歼敌万余
　  敌向汉江南岸进犯以来损失兵力六万多
    【新华社朝鲜前线七日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在汉城以北至北纬三十八度线附近地区，继续与进犯的美、英等国侵略军和李承晚伪军英勇作战，从三月十五日到三月三十一日，又歼灭敌军一万余人。这样，敌军从一月二十五日向汉江南岸发动进攻以来，计已损失兵力六万余人，其中美军被消灭的在三万人以上。在这次进攻之初，麦克阿瑟曾大肆吹嘘其“以运动战消耗敌军（指朝、中人民部队）兵力”的战法。但事实证明遭到惨重消耗的不是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，却正是美国侵略军及其帮凶们自己。
