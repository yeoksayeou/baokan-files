    I am reunited with my daughter
    An Jia Yumei thanks the government for taking over "Canaan Orphanage"
    Editor:
    Recently, the Beijing branch of the Chinese People's Relief Administration took over the Beijing "Canaan Orphanage," and my child (now named An Xiawa) escaped from the sea of ​​suffering. My child has been sent to the fourth grade of the First Affiliated Elementary School of Beijing Municipal Normal School. I thank the People's Government for rescuing my child and reuniting our mother and daughter.
    My name is An Jia Yumei. My husband is an electrician. Fourteen years ago, my husband could not work due to illness, and there was no way to make a living. In desperation, I sent my three-month-old daughter to the "Canaan Orphanage."
    After my child was admitted to the orphanage, it was like being sold. I could only see her once a year during the Qingming Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival, but I couldn't talk freely. I missed my child so much that I went blind.
    After liberation, my second son went to work in a factory, and my family no longer worried about making a living. Recently, my eldest son joined the Chinese People's Volunteers and went to Korea to fight the American devils. I feel that everything has become better, but there is still one thing that makes me feel uncomfortable: that is, my daughter is still suffering in the "Canaan Orphanage."
    Now I am extremely happy. I sincerely thank the People's Government and thank Chairman Mao. Without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, my daughter and I would never be reunited. I will write a letter to my eldest son in Korea, telling him to bravely strike at the American invading army. I will raise my children well and let them serve the people and repay Chairman Mao's great kindness when they grow up.

    我和我的女儿团圆了
    安贾玉梅感谢政府接管“迦南孤儿院”编辑同志：
    最近，中国人民救济总会北京分会接管了北京“迦南孤儿院”，我的孩子（现名安夏娃）跳出了苦海。我的孩子已被送到北京市立师范第一附属小学四年级念书。我感谢人民政府救出了我的孩子，使我们母女得到团圆。
    我叫安贾玉梅。我的丈夫是一个电灯匠。十四年前，我的丈夫因病不能工作，生活毫无办法。在万不得已的情况下，我把三个月的女孩子送入“迦南孤儿院”。
    我的孩子入院以后，就像被卖掉了一样。只有每年清明节、中秋节、我才能看一次孩子，但不能随便说话。我因为想念孩子，眼睛也急瞎了。
    解放后，我的二儿子进了工厂做工，我家生活就不愁了。最近，我的大儿子参加中国人民志愿军到朝鲜去打美国鬼子了。我觉着什么都变好了，只有一件事还使我心里不大痛快：这就是我的女孩子还在“迦南孤儿院”里受苦。
    现在，我高兴极了。我衷心感谢人民政府，感谢毛主席。如果没有共产党、毛主席，我和我的女儿是永远不能团圆的。我要写信告诉在朝鲜的大儿子，叫他英勇地打击美国侵略军队。我要好好地教养我的孩子们，让他们长大后为人民服务，报答毛主席的厚恩。
