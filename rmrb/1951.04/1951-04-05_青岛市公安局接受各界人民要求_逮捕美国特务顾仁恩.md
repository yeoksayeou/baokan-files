The Qingdao Public Security Bureau, responding to the people's demands, recently arrested Gu Ren'en, an American imperialist spy who was carrying out nefarious activities under the cloak of religion. The culprit Gu is from Hangzhou, and is 45 years old. Gu joined Christianity at the age of 24 and became acquainted with the American spy Mason. Afterwards, he used preaching as a cover to conduct espionage activities for American imperialism. After the successive liberation of various parts of the country, the culprit, following Mason's instructions, used the name of "obeying the Lord Jesus Christ's command to heal the sick and cast out demons" in Hangzhou, Tianjin, Suzhou, Wuxi, Shanghai, Qingdao and other places, fooling and deceiving backward masses, and taking the opportunity to carry out counter-revolutionary propaganda. Liu Yuxuan and other patriotic Christians in Qingdao exposed the crimes of the culprit Gu in the Qingdao Daily on March 7, demanding that the government punish him. People from all walks of life and many patriotic Christians also exposed the culprit's counter-revolutionary crimes one after another, and many of those who had been deceived demanded that the government severely punish him. The Qingdao Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, responding to the demands of the broad masses of the people, arrested Gu Ren'en. After being arrested, the culprit Gu confessed to his crimes of using religion as a cover to carry out counter-revolutionary activities for American imperialism. People from all walks of life in Qingdao wrote to the Qingdao Daily one after another, expressing their firm support for the People's Government's measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries.

    逮捕美国特务顾仁恩
    青岛市人民政府公安局接受人民的要求，于最近逮捕了披着宗教外衣进行罪恶活动的美帝国主义特务顾仁恩。顾犯系杭州人，现年四十五岁。顾犯二十四岁时参加了基督教，结识了美国特务麦森。嗣后即以传教为名，为美帝国主义进行特务活动。全国各地相继解放后，该犯遵照麦森的指示，以“奉主耶稣基督之命，医病赶鬼”为名，先后在杭州、天津、苏州、无锡、上海、青岛等地，愚弄欺骗落后群众，乘机进行反革命宣传。青岛市爱国基督教徒刘玉轩等于三月七日在青岛日报上揭发了顾犯的罪恶，要求政府予以制裁。各界人民及许多爱国基督教徒也纷纷揭发该犯的反革命罪行，许多被骗者都要求政府予以严厉制裁。青岛市人民政府公安局接受广大人民的要求，乃将顾仁恩逮捕。顾犯被捕后，对以宗教为掩护，为美帝国主义进行反革命活动的罪行，一一供认不讳。青岛市各界人民又纷纷写信给青岛日报，表示坚决拥护人民政府镇压反革命的措施。
