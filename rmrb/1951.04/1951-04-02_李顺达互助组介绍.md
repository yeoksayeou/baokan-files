　　Introduction to Li Shunda's Mutual Aid Team
　　Li Shunda's name is well-known in Shanxi Province. During the Anti-Japanese War, he was a famous labor model in Ping顺 County and the Taihang area. Last year, he also attended the Shanxi Provincial Congress of Industrial and Agricultural Labor Models and the National Congress of Labor Models for Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. The mutual aid team he led received the honorary title of "Model Mutual Aid Team" and was awarded a certificate with Chairman Mao's personal inscription, "Model on the Production Front." The main reason he and his mutual aid team received such respect and love is that for eight years he correctly implemented Chairman Mao's policy of "organizing" to develop rural production. As early as 1942, Li Shunda led the farmers of Xigou Village to organize labor exchange and mutual assistance to overcome disasters, implement improved technology, and increase yields, enabling all the villagers to achieve a prosperous life. Their personal experience proved that organizing is the best way for the vast number of peasants to transform from poverty to wealth and become prosperous.
　　Li Shunda was originally from Lin County, Henan Province (now under the jurisdiction of Pingyuan Province). Nineteen years ago, he fled famine to Xigou Village. At that time, his family of five had nothing, living in three dilapidated cave dwellings, renting twelve mu and seven fen of sloping land from the landlord. His village, Xigou, was a remote mountain gully with high mountains, thick rocks, and barren land. The whole village had twenty households, scattered in four gullies. The whole village produced 200 shi of grain annually, but paid more than 100 shi in rent to the landlords. Therefore, all the villagers lived a hard life of "half a year of chaff and vegetables, and half a year of grain."
　　　　Organizing Labor Mutual Assistance to Overcome Various Difficulties
　　In 1942, Ping顺 County suffered a drought, and the masses faced great difficulties in production and life. At that time, Li Shunda, based on the masses' demands to overcome difficulties and persist in production, actively responded to the call of the Communist Party and the People's Government to "organize to produce for self-salvation." In the spring of 1943, he first organized a six-person mutual aid team. According to the wasteland reclamation policy promulgated by the People's Government, the entire team reclaimed seven mu of wasteland and accumulated more than 18,000 jin of firewood in eight days. Their exemplary actions enhanced the masses' confidence in production for self-salvation and their enthusiasm for labor mutual assistance, enabling the mutual aid team to develop to sixteen households, divided into three groups, with Li Shunda elected as the captain. Subsequently, Li Shunda and others launched mutual aid and lending within the mutual aid team, lending a total of five shi of coarse grains, solving the difficulty of food shortage for some team members during wasteland reclamation. That year, the entire team reclaimed a total of 120 mu of wasteland, all planted with potatoes. After the autumn harvest, they harvested more than 100,000 jin, enabling the villagers to smoothly survive the famine year.
　　From 1944 to 1945, due to the busy war effort, Xigou Village farmers lacked labor and livestock. At this time, Li Shunda and the farmers remaining in the village made precise calculations, absorbing semi-able-bodied labor into the mutual aid team, and carried out scientific division of labor within the team, enabling all the villagers to complete plowing and harvesting tasks in a timely manner. In 1944, the entire village planted all the reclaimed wasteland with millet, and harvested a total of 120 shi of grain in the autumn. The villagers sold more than 50 shi of surplus grain and bought land, five head of draft animals, and many farm tools. From then on, the villagers laid the foundation for developing production. During the autumn harvest of 1945, each of the five mutual aid teams in the village had only one able-bodied male laborer left. At this time, Li Shunda and others mobilized thirty-two women, old men, and children to participate in the mutual aid team, concentrating labor according to the terrain. Within three days, they harvested all the millet in the village. During the autumn harvest, all the farmers participating in the mutual aid team were very satisfied because each mutual aid team correctly implemented the policy of "voluntary mutual benefit, equal exchange" and improved the democratic system within the team.
　　　　Intensive Farming and Improved Technology
　　In 1947, the difficulty of labor and livestock shortage for farmers in Xigou Village had been basically overcome. The farmers began to demand improved technology, and the People's Government also put forward the call for "intensive farming." At this time, Li Shunda led the team members to process and add fertilizer, and proposed the slogan "People have stood up, and the land must also stand up." However, Li Shunda encountered resistance from some farmers' conservative ideas when mobilizing all the villagers to improve technology. Li Shunda was not discouraged, and he patiently educated the farmers. In the past, the farmers in the village had no habit of plowing. Li Shunda first conducted experiments on his own seven fen of land, which was covered with grass and had not been harvested for three years. He plowed this piece of land three times to ensure that the grass was cleared and the soil was loose. As a result, he harvested one shi and seven dou of grain. He then led the mutual aid team to build terraces on thirty-two mu of thin hillside land, resulting in an increase in yield of 30% to 50% per mu. Later, based on years of weeding experience, he studied the appropriate distance between rows of seedlings on terraces, mountain ridges, and slopes. Li Shunda seized these examples of increased yields due to improved technology to educate the farmers, and as a result, he reversed the masses' old habits such as "not plowing in spring," "dense seedlings are better than sparse seedlings," and "farming requires effort, not skill," and gradually launched a technical improvement movement throughout the village. Later, he also discovered that sowing with a three-legged seed drill resulted in dense seedlings and poor ventilation, which easily damaged crops, while sowing with a two-legged seed drill resulted in wide ridges and good ventilation, which saved labor in weeding and increased yields. From then on, the entire village universally adopted two-legged seed drills, widened the distance between rows of crops, and increased the village's yield by one-third compared to previous years. In 1946, when Li Shunda promoted warm-water seed soaking, the masses did not believe it, fearing that it would scald the seeds to death. After two years of research and experimentation, he proved that warm-water seed soaking could reduce crop diseases. He also organized farmers to visit the fields and conduct comparative education with examples. Last year, all the seeds in the village were soaked and mixed with pesticides.
　　　　Xigou Village Transforms from Poverty to Wealth
　　Upon entering Xigou Village, you will see layers of neat terraces, newly planted forests, cattle and sheep all over the mountains, and newly built houses, creating a new scene. Truly, a poor gully has become a rich gully, and a barren mountain has become a treasure mountain. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the entire village had 171 mu of cultivated land, of which 114 mu were rented from landlords in other villages. Now, the villagers own 224 mu of cultivated land, 85% of which has become fertile land. The yield per mu in the entire village has exceeded 77.5% of the pre-war production level. The Li Shunda mutual aid team has exceeded 95% of the pre-war level. The number of draft animals in the entire village has increased from fifteen before the war to forty-three, and the number of sheep has increased from fifty before the war to one hundred and twenty-seven. The entire village has afforested 280 mu of barren mountains and built more than fifty new houses. Every family in the village has surplus grain, and the farmers' children have also entered schools. Li Shunda's family of twelve has eleven rooms, three cave dwellings, more than thirty mu of land, five head of livestock, thirty-four sheep, and more than twenty mu of mountain forest. The annual income, totaling grain, reaches more than eighty shi.
　　　　Launching a Patriotic Production Competition
　　Last winter, in order to prepare for expanding production this year, the mutual aid team led by Li Shunda first proposed launching a patriotic winter production competition to labor models and farmers throughout Shanxi Province. His call was quickly met with enthusiastic responses from labor models and farmers throughout the province. Because he repeatedly conducted patriotic education within the team and constantly checked and summarized the team's production, the mutual aid team he led overfulfilled the winter production plan by the end of February this year. In March this year, the Li Shunda mutual aid team took the lead in responding to the call of the National Agricultural Work Conference to launch a nationwide patriotic bumper harvest movement, and challenged mutual aid teams across the country to guarantee a bumper harvest of crops this year. The entire team also proposed a production plan of 378 jin per mu this year, an increase of 21 jin over last year, exceeding 108.4% of the pre-war production level per mu. His challenge has also been met with enthusiastic responses from labor models and mutual aid teams across the country.

　　李顺达互助组介绍
    李顺达的名字，在山西省是家喻户晓的。在抗日战争时期，他就是平顺县和太行区的著名劳动模范。去年，他又出席了山西省工农业劳动模范大会和全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议。他所领导的互助组，曾得到了“模范互助组”的光荣称号，并获得毛主席亲笔题辞“生产战线上的模范”的奖状。他和他的互助组受到这样的尊崇和爱戴，主要原因是由于他八年来正确地执行了毛主席“组织起来”的这一发展农村生产的方针。早于一九四二年，李顺达便领导西沟村的农民组织变工互助，战胜灾害，实行改良技术，增加了产量，使全村农民实现了丰衣足食。他们亲身的体验证明：组织起来是广大农民由穷变富、发家致富的最好道路。
    李顺达原来是河南省林县（现属平原省）人，十九年前他逃荒到西沟村。当时他全家五口人，一无所有，佃居破窑三孔，租种着地主的十二亩七分坡地。他的所在村——西沟，是个山高石厚、土地瘠薄的偏僻小山沟。全村二十户，还分散在四个沟岔。全村每年产粮二百石，但是向地主缴租就达百石以上。因此，全村农民都过着“半年糠菜半年粮”的困苦生活。
            组织劳动互助，克服各种困难
    一九四二年平顺县遭了旱灾，群众的生产与生活十分困难。当时，李顺达根据群众克服困难、坚持生产的要求，积极响应了共产党和人民政府提出的“组织起来生产自救”的号召。一九四三年春，他首先组织起一个六人的互助组，依据人民政府颁布的开荒政策，全组人员八天共开荒七亩，积柴一万八千余斤。他们的模范行动提高了群众生产自救的信心和劳动互助的积极性，使互助组发展到十六户，共分为三个组，李顺达被选为大队长。接着，李顺达等又在互助组内发动了互济互借，共借出杂粮五石，解决了组内一部分组员开荒时缺乏口粮的困难。那年全组共开荒一百二十亩，全部播种了山药蛋。秋后共收获十万多斤，使全村农民顺利度过了荒年。
    一九四四年至四五年，由于战勤繁忙，西沟村农民劳畜力非常缺乏。这时李顺达便和留在村里的农民精确计算，吸收半辅劳力参加了互助组，在组内进行科学分工，使全村农民都能及时完成耕种收割的任务。一九四四年，全村把开出的荒地全部种成谷子，秋后共收了一百二十石粮，该村农民把五十石余粮出卖了，买了土地和五头耕畜以及许多农具。从此，全村农民便奠定了发展生产的基础。一九四五年秋收时，该村五个互助组每组只剩下一个男全劳力，这时，李顺达等便动员三十二个妇女、老汉和儿童参加互助组，依据地形集中使用劳力。三天内便将全村的谷子都收割完毕。在秋收时，由于各互助组正确贯彻“自愿互利、等价交换”的政策，在组内并健全了民主制度，因此，所有参加互助组的农民都很满意。
            精耕细作，改良技术
    一九四七年，西沟村农民的劳畜力困难已基本克服。农民开始要求提高技术，人民政府也提出了“精耕细作”的号召。这时，李顺达领导互助组组员加工加肥，并提出“人翻了身，土地也要翻身”的口号。但是，李顺达在发动全村农民改良技术时，受到某些农民守旧思想的抵抗。李顺达不灰心，他耐心地教育农民。过去该村农民没有犁地习惯，李顺达便首先在自己的一块草多、三年没收成的七分土地上进行实验、他把这块地犁了三遍，作到草尽土松。结果收粮一石七斗。他又领导互助组把三十二亩山坡薄地，修成了梯田，结果每亩增产百分之三十至五十。以后，他又根据历年的锄苗经验，研究出梯田、山梁地以及坡地上留苗行间的适当距离。李顺达抓紧这些由于改良技术增加产量的例子教育农民，结果，扭转了群众“春不犁地”、“留苗稠比稀强”以及“种地没巧，出力就好”等旧的习惯，使全村农民逐步地展开了技术改良运动。以后，他又发现用三条腿耧播种，苗稠不通风，容易坏庄稼，用两条腿耧播种，垅宽通风，锄苗省工，产量也大。从此，全村便普遍采用了两条腿耧播种，加宽了作物的行间距离，使全村的产量比往年增加三分之一。一九四六年，李顺达在推广温汤浸种时，群众不相信，怕烫死。经过他两年的钻研试验，证明温汤浸种可以减轻作物病害。他并组织农民田间参观，进行实例对比的教育。去年全村的种籽便全部作到浸种、拌种。
            西沟村由穷变富
    一进入西沟村，便会看到一层层整齐的梯田，和一片片新植的树林，牛羊满山，到处修盖着新房屋等新的景象。真是穷沟变富沟，荒山变宝山了。抗战以前，全村共有耕地一百七十一亩，内有一百一十四亩是租种外村地主的。现在全村农民已拥有耕地二百二十四亩，其中有百分之八十五已变成良田。全村每亩产量已超过战前生产水平的百分之七十七点五。李顺达互助组就超过战前水平的百分之九十五。全村耕畜已由战前十五头，增至四十三头，羊由战前五十只，增至一百二十七只。全村荒山造林二百八十亩，新盖房屋五十余间。全村家家有了余粮，农民的子弟也都进了学校。李顺达全家十二口人，有十一间房、三孔窑、三十余亩地，五头牲畜。三十四只羊、二十余亩山林。每年的收入，合计粮食共达八十石以上。
            挑起爱国主义生产竞赛
    去年冬天，李顺达所领导的互助组为了作好今年扩大生产的准备工作，首先向山西全省劳动模范和农民提出了开展爱国主义冬季生产竞赛。他的号召迅速得到全省劳动模范和广大农民的热烈响应。由于他在组内反复地进行了爱国主义教育，并不断地进行检查和总结全组生产，因而在今年二月底，他所领导的互助组超额完成了冬季生产计划。今年三月，李顺达互助组又首先响应全国农业工作会议关于开展全国性的爱国丰产运动的号召，向全国各地互助组提出保证今年农作物丰产的挑战。全组并提出今年每亩产量三百七十八斤，比去年增产二十一斤，超过战前每亩生产水平百分之一百零八点四的增产计划。他的挑战，也已得到全国各地劳动模范和互助组的热烈应战。
