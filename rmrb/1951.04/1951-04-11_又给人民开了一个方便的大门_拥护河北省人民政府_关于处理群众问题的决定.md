Another Convenient Door Opened for the People
Supporting the Hebei Provincial People's Government's "Decision on Handling Mass Problems"

To the Editor:
    I read the "Decision on Handling Mass Problems" promulgated by the Hebei Provincial People's Government in the Hebei Daily on March 2nd. I think this is a very good thing. According to this decision, if we, the people, have any demands or opinions of the government, as long as we write a letter or talk to the government, the government will be responsible for handling and answering them. The government has opened another convenient door for us, and this is the benefit of our People's Government. When the Kuomintang reactionary government was in power, if we entered the yamen (government office), we would either have to spend money or suffer. At that time, we ordinary people were afraid of entering the yamen and seeing officials. Now it is different. People can seek the government for anything; if the government handles or answers slowly, the people can even urge them. This is because the current government has truly become the people's own working organ.

    However, there are still some staff members in our People's Government who do not pay enough attention to the issues that the people directly raise with them. For example, in our village, there is the land problem of a revolutionary soldier's family. Because the village did not resolve it well, he himself wrote to the county government twice to inquire, but as a result, he has not received a reply for more than three months. Since we write letters or run to the government, we must feel that this is an important matter. Some cadres in our People's Government sometimes do not understand this point. Some things that the cadres themselves consider unimportant, they think the people do not value either, so they do not seriously resolve them. I think this is the shortcoming that exists when some cadres handle the problems raised by the people. In a neighboring village, a farmer had two trees by his threshing ground forcibly sawed down by village cadres to repair a bridge, and the farmer was so angry that he did not eat for two days. He traveled more than fifty li to the county to complain. A cadre in the county People's Government said, "So what if they were sawed down? Are two trees worth getting so angry about!" In my opinion, cadres like this must never be allowed to take on the work of answering questions from the masses.

    From the perspective of us, the people, we must also help the government in every way. For example, if we all keep our eyes open and report counter-revolutionaries in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, this matter will be much easier to handle. In addition, the opinions and requests made to the government must also be honest. We cannot only talk about our own side of the story. There was a land dispute case that had already been adjudicated by the Tongxian Special District Branch of the Provincial People's Court. The defendant had no reason at all, but he still went to the newspaper and the higher-level government to demand that the matter be handled. When he went, he only talked about his own side of the story, did not mention the circumstances of the court's judgment, and did not mention the plaintiff's reasons. This is also wrong.

### 又给人民开了一个方便的大门　拥护河北省人民政府“关于处理群众问题的决定”

　　又给人民开了一个方便的大门
　　拥护河北省人民政府“关于处理群众问题的决定”编辑同志：
    我在三月二日的河北日报上，看到河北省人民政府公布的“关于处理群众问题的决定”。我觉得这件事很好。根据这个决定，咱们人民对政府有什么要求和意见，只要写上个信，或是找政府谈谈，政府就会负责地处理和答复。政府又给咱开了一个方便的大门，这就是咱们人民政府的好处。国民党反动政府在时，咱们进了衙门，不是花钱就得受罪。那时，咱们老百姓都怕进衙门，怕见官。现在可不同了，人民有什么事情找政府；政府办理或回答慢了，人民还能催促。这就是因为现在的政府真正成了人民自己的办事机关。
    可是，咱们人民政府中也还有些工作人员，对人民直接向他提出来的事，还不大重视。例如咱村有一个革命军人家属的土地问题，因为村里解决的不好，他本人两次写信到县政府问，结果，三个多月还没有得到回答。咱们既然写信或跑去找政府，咱们心里一定觉得这是重要的大事。咱们人民政府的干部有时就不懂得这一点。有些事，干部们自己认为不重要，就以为人民也不看重，也就不认真解决。我觉得这就是有些干部在办理人民所提出的问题时所存在的缺点。邻村有一个农民，场边有两棵树被村干部强迫锯下去修桥了，农民气得两天没有吃饭。他跑了五十多里路到县里去控诉。县人民政府的一位干部说，锯就锯了，两棵树值得这样生气吗！照我说，像这样的干部可千万不能担任解答群众问题的工作。
    在咱们人民来说，也要处处帮助政府。比方对镇压反革命，如果咱们人人擦亮眼睛，检举反革命分子，这件事就好办多了。另外，向政府提出的意见和要求也得老老实实，不能只说自己一面理。有一件土地纠纷案，已经由省人民法院通县专区分院判决了，被告根本没有理由，但他还到报社和上级政府要求处理这件事，去了只说自己一方面的道理，不说经法院判决的情形，也不提原告的理由，这也是不对的。
