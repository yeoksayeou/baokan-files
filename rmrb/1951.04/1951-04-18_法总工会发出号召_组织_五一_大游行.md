TASS, Paris, April 14th: The French General Confederation of Labor has issued a call to all French workers, urging them to organize a united "May Day" parade, making "May Day" a day of struggle for peace, bread, and freedom.

The French General Confederation of Labor calls on the French working people to "struggle for peace, demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, and jointly strive against provocation against the People's China, for a cessation of the Korean War, and against the danger of a Third World War; to jointly strive against continuing the war against the Vietnamese people, against the production and transportation of military materials, against turning France into a foreign war base, against the American occupation of French territory, and against the remilitarization of West Germany." The General Confederation of Labor also calls for struggle against the infringement of democratic freedoms, against the suppression of democrats and patriots, against undermining universal suffrage, to strive for the satisfaction of workers' demands (adjustment of wages, establishment of a wage system adjusted according to the price index), against raising prices and wasting national wealth, to strive for the conclusion of genuine collective contracts, and to strive for the realization of the principle of "equal pay for equal work."
