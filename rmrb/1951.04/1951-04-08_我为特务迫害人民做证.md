　　I Testify to the Persecution of the People by Special Agents
　　He Jianzhang
　　I used to study at the former Chaoyang University. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, I was reminded again of the crimes committed by the special agent Zhang Minzhi in persecuting me and my classmates at Chaoyang University. On the evening of December 2, 1948, Zhang Minzhi dispatched dozens of special agents, carrying guns, knives, ropes, iron bars, and wooden sticks, to break into the students' dormitories. The special agents dragged the students out of their sleep and beat them indiscriminately. Some students were beaten until they vomited blood, and some students' arms and legs were broken. In total, more than 200 people were beaten that night. In the eleven days from the 2nd to the 13th, more than 1,300 Chaoyang students were beaten (out of a total of more than 1,400 Chaoyang students), and more than 40 students were arrested successively. At that time, everyone was panic-stricken, and the students could not concentrate on their studies. On the morning of December 7, I was arrested. The special agents took me into the "Chaoyang Special Criminal Tribunal," where I suffered all kinds of torture.
　　The circumstances of my torture are unforgettable. The special agents tied me up, and three or four people beat me wildly with wooden sticks, until they broke my right leg bone. Then the special agents arrested my classmate Yang Zhaomin. He was beaten unconscious and fell into the corner of the wall. The special agents then threw a 20-pound iron dumbbell on his foot. The special agents asked me, "Did you see that?" I did not say anything. Immediately, I was punched in the face several times, and blood flowed from my nose and teeth. Even more cruel, they whipped me all over with bamboo canes, and blood was flowing everywhere on my head and hands. My legs were so badly tortured that I couldn't stand up. They said I was pretending to be stupid, so they used small wooden sticks to clamp between my fingers and twisted them hard. When the wooden sticks broke, they did it a second time. In the evening, I was dragged into another dormitory. In the center of the room was a stove, and the pack of jackals sat all around. There was a poker in the stove, burning red hot. I stood close to the stove. The special agents laughed happily and began to burn my hands with the poker. I was in pain and tried to avoid it, but they laughed even harder. The special agents were so inhuman.
　　The next day, another classmate, Hua Shangzhi, was arrested. He was beaten even more severely. Like us, he was beaten continuously. Before being sent to the Kuomintang Artillery Bureau prison, they gave him an extra session of torture. The special agents used the most vicious methods against him. They tied his genitals to his neck with a small rope, and he bent over like an arch. Then, the special agents beat his thighs with wooden sticks until the flesh was red. When they wiped it with salt water, fresh blood spurted out of his pores when they hit him again. ...On the evening of the 9th, six of us inmates were sent to the Kuomintang Artillery Bureau prison. In the prison, I saw many people who had been arrested by special agencies such as the so-called "Special Criminal Tribunal" and "Shock Brigade." In less than ten days, more than 2,000 people were sent in. The punishments they suffered were even more tragic to hear. There were "eye-stabbing," "cold water灌 (guàn)," "chili water灌 (guàn)," "tiger bench," "electric shock," etc. In short, the special agents used all the most barbaric and vicious punishments.
　　In the old society ruled by the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, we had no basic human rights and freedom. After liberation, these special agents have not given up and are still carrying out sabotage activities. Therefore, I demand that the government resolutely, thoroughly, and severely suppress counter-revolutionaries. Arrest those who should be arrested, and kill those who should be killed, without hesitation. We must ensure that there is no room for them if we exist!

　　我为特务迫害人民做证
　　贺建章
    我曾在前朝阳大学上学。在镇压反革命运动中，我又想到特务张民治迫害我和朝阳大学同学的罪行。一九四八年十二月二日的晚上，张民治驱使了几十个特务，带着枪、刀、绳索、铁棍、木棒，闯进了同学的宿舍。特务们把同学们从睡梦中拖起来，不分青红皂白，就是一顿毒打。有的同学被打得吐血，有的同学的胳膊、腿也被打断了。总计这天晚上有二百多人被打。从二日到十三日的十一天中，朝阳同学有一千三百多人挨了打（朝阳同学共一千四百余人），先后被捕的同学有四十多人。当时人心惶惶，同学们不能安心读书。十二月七日早晨，我被逮捕。特务们把我带进“朝阳特刑庭”的房子里，在这里我受尽了毒刑。
    我受刑的情形是永生难忘的。特务们将我绑起，三、四个人用木棒乱捶乱打，一直把我的右腿骨生生打断。接着特务们又捕来了同学杨昭敏。他被打得昏迷不醒，倒在墙角里。特务们又把二十多磅重的铁铔铃，甩在他脚上。特务们问我：“你看见了没有？”我没有作声。紧跟着我的脸上就挨了几拳，鼻血、牙血流了出来。更残酷的是，他们用竹鞭子在我身上乱抽，我的头上，手上，到处都在流血。我的腿受刑过甚，站不起来，他们说我装傻，就用小木棍夹在我的手指缝里，使劲地绞，木棍断了，又来二次。晚上，把我拖进另一间宿舍。房中央烧着炉子，四面坐着那班豺狼，火炉里有根通条，烧得红红的。我就靠近火炉站着。特务们笑着开心，用通条开始烫我的手。我痛，想避开，他们就笑得更厉害。特务们就是这样一点没有人性。
    第二天，又捕来了一位同学花尚之。他被打得更厉害。像我们一样，连续挨打，在临送国民党炮局监狱前，还特别为他加了一顿刑。特务们对他采用了最毒辣的手段，他们用小绳子将他的生殖器连着脖子捆住，人弯着身子像个弓形。然后，特务们用木棍痛打他的大腿，肉打得通红，用盐水一擦，再打时，鲜血从汗毛孔里直冒出来。……九号晚上，我们六个难友被送到国民党炮局监狱。在监狱里看到很多被所谓“特刑庭”、“突击大队”等特务机关捕来的人。不到十天，就送来两千人以上。他们受的刑罚，听来更加凄惨。有“刺马眼”、“灌凉水”、“灌辣椒水”、“坐老虎凳”、“电刑”等，总之一切最野蛮、最毒狠的刑罚，特务们都使尽了。
    我们在美、蒋匪帮统治的旧社会，没有起码的做人的权利和自由。解放之后，这些特务们还没有死心，仍在进行破坏活动。因此，我要求政府坚决、彻底、严厉地镇压反革命，该捕的就捕，该杀的就杀，毫不犹疑，要做到有我们就没有他们！
