　　The China Education Union Beijing Committee and Beijing Student Federation Issue Notice
　　Calling on Teachers, Staff, Students, and Workers in All Schools to Stand at the Forefront of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
　　[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to promote the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea, the Beijing Committee of the China Education Union and the Beijing Student Federation held a joint meeting on March 28. The meeting decided that teachers, staff, workers, and students in all schools should maintain close contact in order to unify the actions of the Education Union and the Student Federation in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. The meeting also passed and issued the following notice: To all teachers, staff, students, and workers in Beijing:
　　The China National Committee of the Resist America, Aid Korea has issued a notice on March 14, calling on the people of the whole country to respond to the resolution of the World Peace Council, and to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement throughout the country, putting forward the slogan "to ensure that every place and everyone in the country receives this patriotic education, and can actively participate in this patriotic action." We must resolutely respond to this call. To this end, the education workers' unions and student unions in all schools should formulate plans within a short period of time and implement them. We call on all schools to do the following:
　　1. Use various forms to strengthen patriotic education on Resist America, Aid Korea. The central content of the current propaganda and education is to oppose the United States rearming Japan, support the resolution of the World Peace Council, and support the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. It is necessary to continuously improve the understanding of the essence of American imperialism, and continuously improve patriotic thinking, so that the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement becomes an important part of our lives; becomes a constant driving force for doing a good job in teaching, studying hard, and doing good work.
　　2. Establish patriotic covenants on the basis of patriotic thought, making them the program of our patriotic actions, so as to consolidate and enhance our patriotic enthusiasm and understanding, and promote the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, so that it can be carried out persistently and deeply. Patriotic covenants should be fully conceived, discussed and passed by all teachers, students and staff. At the meetings to discuss the patriotic covenant, votes can also be taken on supporting the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers and opposing the United States rearming Japan.
　　3. Consciously undertake the political task of carrying out Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda to the broad masses of the people. Use after-school holidays to regularly conduct propaganda to the people near the school and their families. During the spring break, organize small propaganda teams to go to the countryside to conduct propaganda.
　　4. Greet the "May Day" demonstration parade. Through various patriotic propaganda and education activities before "May Day", all teachers, students and staff should understand the significance of the demonstration, jointly do various specific preparations, and participate in the city's "May Day" demonstration parade.
　　Our Beijing Education Union and Beijing Student Federation are preparing to jointly convene a city-wide representative conference in mid-April to summarize and exchange the experience of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, formulate a work plan for continuing to promote the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in the future, and pass the patriotic covenant of educators and students throughout the city.
　　Resisting America and aiding Korea is the primary task of the Chinese people at present. All educators and students in Beijing, carry forward our glorious revolutionary tradition and stand at the forefront of this movement!

　　中国教育工会北京市委员会及北京市学联发出通知       
    号召各校教师职员学生工友站在抗美援朝运动的最前列
    【本报讯】中国教育工会北京市委员会与北京市学生联合会，为推动抗美援朝的爱国主义运动，于三月二十八日召开联席会议，决定今后各校教师、职员、工友与学生应密切联系，以便统一教育工会与学生会在抗美援朝运动中的行动步骤。会议并通过发出通知如下：北京市全体教师职员同学工友同志们：
    中国人民抗美援朝总会已于三月十四日发出通告，号召全国人民响应世界和平理事会的决议，并在全国普及与深入抗美援朝运动，提出了“务使全国每一处每一人都受到这个爱国教育，都能积极参加这个爱国行动”，我们要坚决地响应这个号召。为此目的，各校教育工作者工会与学生会应于短期间内制订计划，并加以执行。我们号召各校做好下列几项工作：
    一、运用各种形式，加强抗美援朝的爱国教育。目前宣传教育的中心内容是反对美国重新武装日本、拥护世界和平理事会决议与拥护镇压反革命等。要不断地提高对美帝国主义本质的认识，不断地提高爱国主义思想，使抗美援朝爱国运动成为我们生活中的重要部分；成为搞好教学、努力学习、做好工作的经常动力。
    二、在爱国主义思想基础上订立爱国公约，使它成为我们的爱国行动纲领，以巩固与提高我们的爱国热情与认识，推动抗美援朝运动，使能持久深入地进行。爱国公约应经过全校师生员工充分地酝酿、讨论与通过。在讨论爱国公约的集会上，可同时对拥护五大国缔结和平公约与反对美国重新武装日本举行表决。
    三、自觉地担负起对广大的人民群众进行抗美援朝宣传的政治任务。利用课余假日，经常地向学校附近的人民和自己的家属进行宣传。春假期间，组织小型宣传队下乡宣传。
    四、迎接“五一”示威大游行。通过“五一”以前各种爱国主义的宣传、教育活动，使全校师生员工了解示威的意义，共同做好各种具体准备工作，参加“五一”节全市的示威游行。
    我们北京市教育工会和北京市学生联合会准备在四月中旬联合召开全市代表大会，总结与交流抗美援朝运动的经验，制订今后继续推进抗美援朝运动的工作计划，通过全市教育工作者和同学的爱国公约。
    抗美援朝是中国人民当前的首要任务，北京市全体教育工作者与同学们，发扬我们光辉的革命传统，站在这个运动的最前列！

                                联合会  一九五一年三月二十八日
