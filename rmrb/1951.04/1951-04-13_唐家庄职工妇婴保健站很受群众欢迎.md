The Tangjiazhuang Workers' Maternity and Child Health Station is very popular among the masses

Last September, the Tangjiazhuang Hospital in Tangshan City experimentally established a Workers' Maternity and Child Health Station. By the end of January of this year, a total of 490 pregnant women had been examined and 282 deliveries had been performed, without a single case of illness or death.

In the past, Tangjiazhuang Hospital did not have maternity ward facilities, and most pregnant women were sent to Linxi Hospital. Because it was far from home, it was inconvenient for workers to take care of them. Many pregnant women requested to be discharged three or two days after giving birth, which increased the incidence of illness and death among mothers and infants, and affected the production morale of the workers. The establishment of the Workers' Maternity and Child Health Station made the workers feel extremely happy.

After the Maternity and Child Health Station started working, it first conducted a general examination and registration of pregnant women, and publicized the precautions to be taken during the delivery period; and established a regular re-examination system. They also adopted a "family visit" method for women about to give birth, checking the preparations of the necessary supplies for the mother and baby. At the time of delivery, comrades from the health station personally went to the workers' homes to deliver the babies. After the baby was born, the health station continued to conduct regular home visits, paying attention to all changes in the mother and infant after delivery, until the mother and infant were completely healthy, and then the health work was concluded. Therefore, the Workers' Maternity and Child Health Station has been supported by the majority of workers and their families.

　　唐家庄职工妇婴保健站很受群众欢迎
    去年九月里，唐山市唐家庄医院，试办了一所职工妇婴保健站。至本年一月底，共检查产妇四九○人，接产二八二人，没有发生一件疾病和死亡事故。
    过去，唐家庄医院没有产房设备，产妇多送往林西医院。因为离家较远，职工不便照顾，好多产妇在产后三两天就要求出院，增加了产妇及婴儿的疾病和死亡现象；影响了职工的生产情绪。职工妇婴保健站设立后，职工们都感到无比地愉快。
    妇婴保健站开始工作后，首先对孕妇进行了普遍的检查与登记，向她们宣传产期应注意的事项；并且建立了定期的复查制度。对临产妇还采取了“家庭访视”的办法，检查产妇及婴儿必需用品的准备情况。临产时，由保健站工作同志亲往职工家里接生。婴儿下生后，保健站仍定期进行家庭访视，注意妇婴产后的一切变化，直到妇婴完全健康时，才将保健工作告一结束。因此，职工保健妇婴站得到广大职工及其家属的拥护。
