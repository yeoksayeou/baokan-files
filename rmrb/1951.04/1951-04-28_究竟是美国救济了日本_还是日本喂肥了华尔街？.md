　　Was Japan Saved by the United States, or Did Japan Enrich Wall Street?
    Zhuang Tao
    Wall Street's agent—the reactionary U.S. government—writes grandly in Chapter Six of its unilaterally formulated draft of the "Japanese Peace Treaty" that "Japan is unable" to "fulfill its obligations for relief and economic assistance given for the purpose of occupation since September 2, 1945." In other words, the United States, mindful of Japan's poverty, can write off Japan's debts to the United States, formed by "relief" and "economic assistance" in the past, once the peace treaty is signed. What a generous philanthropist! However, no rhetoric of U.S. imperialism can obscure the eyes and ears of the people of the world. Let's take a look at the true colors of this "philanthropist"!
    What is the "relief" and "economic assistance" that the United States gave to Japan for the purpose of occupation? This refers to the portion of the "Occupied Areas Relief Fund" and the "Occupied Areas Economic Recovery Fund" allocated to Japan from the U.S. annual expenditures since September 2, 1945. This amount was stipulated as part of Japan's effective debt to the United States in the final understanding of the "Awamaru Agreement" concluded between Japan and the United States in April 1949. According to the Japan Asahi Economic Yearbook of 1950, the total amount will reach 2,024 million U.S. dollars by the end of June this year. If calculated at the official Japanese exchange rate of 360 yen per U.S. dollar, it amounts to 730 billion yen, exceeding Japan's total budget for this year. So this is not a small amount. This money was extorted from the American people by the reactionary U.S. government, but once it fell into the hands of Wall Street tycoons, it became a means of cruelly exploiting and even destroying Japan under the guise of "relief" and "aid."

  Selling Surplus Goods in the Name of "Relief"
    Japan had no right to interfere with the so-called "Occupied Areas Relief Fund" or "Occupied Areas Economic Recovery Fund" allocated to Japan by the United States over the years after the war. This blood and sweat of the American people fell into the pockets of Wall Street tycoons at the very beginning under the guise of "aiding" the Japanese people. Then, according to their convenience in making money, they exported so-called "aid" materials to Japan. Therefore, since MacArthur, representing the Allied countries, entered Japan on September 2, 1945, he began to sell surplus goods for Wall Street in the name of "relief."
    The most sold were American wheat and American cotton. According to the second trade white paper published by the Japanese government last May, the import of food accounted for 41 percent of Japan's total imports in 1949, of which 75 percent came from the United States; the import of fiber (mainly cotton) accounted for 24 percent of the total imports, of which 80 percent of the cotton came from the United States; most of these imports were paid for by "aid funds." As everyone knows, the U.S. agricultural panic formed by the sharp drop in the prices of wheat, cotton, etc. since 1948 is a factor that has deepened the U.S. economic crisis after the war. Therefore, Wall Street exported a large amount of wheat and cotton in the name of "relief," which can not only plunder a large amount of tax revenue from the American people, but also play a role in stabilizing the highly monopolized prices of wheat and cotton in the country. Therefore, its "relief" to Japan has reached such a "warm" level: taking food as an example, Japan originally planned to import 2.4 million tons of food in 1949, but by the end of the 1949 fiscal year (i.e., the end of March 1950), Japan had imported 3.8 million tons of food, exceeding the planned target by more than 50 percent. As a result, Japan was equal to importing agricultural panic, which promoted the plunge in agricultural product prices. At the beginning of last year, the black market rice price in Japan even fell below the official price, causing the bankruptcy of Japanese rural areas and forcing many farmers to sell their own children.

  Practicing Usury in the Name of "Relief"
    These materials imported into Japan in the name of "relief" are not only surplus materials from the United States, but are actually a heavy usury exploitation of the Japanese people. The high price is staggering. Taking wheat as an example, the wheat that the United States forced Japan to import in 1949 was 5,400 yen per stone per day, while the wheat that the Japanese government purchased from Japanese rural areas at that time was 2,333 yen per stone per day, only accounting for 43 percent of the import price of American wheat. Then, in this way, wouldn't the sales of American wheat in Japan be greatly hindered? But Wall Street has other vicious methods, that is, the Japanese government purchases wheat from the United States at a high price of 5,400 yen per stone per day, and then sells it to the whole country at the general market price. The nearly half of the money lost in the middle per stone per day is paid from the expenditure taken from the Japanese people. As a result, in 1949 alone, the subsidy for imported food paid by the Japanese national treasury reached 48.7 billion yen, accounting for nearly 7 percent of Japan's expenditure that year. In the same year, the total expenditure of the Japanese national treasury for social and labor facilities and health and hygiene expenses for culture, education, labor, and health care was only 32 billion yen, accounting for about 4.6 percent of the expenditure that year.
    Even more shocking is the heavy usury in freight. For example, in 1949, the production price of Red Sea salt was 4.4 U.S. dollars per ton, but once it was shipped to Japan by an American ship, the import price per ton rose to 18.5 U.S. dollars. As a result, the freight and commission received by the United States accounted for nearly 80 percent of the import price. Therefore, even Asao, the president of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, a Mitsubishi zaibatsu company, had to say: "A considerable part of the Marshall Plan aid funds of Western European countries is directly lost as freight for transporting aid materials; Japan is also the same. More than half of the aid funds to Japan this year have been paid as sea freight." (Nissankyo Monthly Report, November 10, 1949)

  Controlling the Economic Lifeline of Japan in the Name of "Relief"
    But the Wall Street tycoons were not reconciled. From 1949, they established the so-called "U.S. Aid Counterpart Fund" system. That is to say, after these overstocked materials of heavy usury arrived in Japan, they had to be immediately converted into yen cash and transferred to the income part of Japan's special accounting budget, called the "U.S. Aid Counterpart Fund," which was completely controlled by the United States and invested in various industrial sectors according to U.S. orders. As of September 1950, the United States had actually invested a total of 145.2 billion yen. Half of this money was directly invested in basic industrial sectors of Japan such as electrical communications, railways, electric power, shipping, coal, steel, and chemicals. If the portion invested in the financial sector and becoming indirect investment in Japanese industry is added, the investment in basic industrial sectors of Japan accounts for 90 percent of the total "U.S. Aid Counterpart Fund" invested. In this way, the United States has actually completely controlled the economic lifeline of Japan, reaching the goal of destroying Japan. Taking 1949 as an example, 80 percent of Japan's electrical communication construction costs and 95 percent of the national railway construction costs were paid by the "U.S. Aid Counterpart Fund."

  Restoring Japan's Military Industry in the Name of "Relief"
    Finally, we must pay attention to the fact that since 1948, when the revolutionary victory of our Chinese people was expanding day by day, the United States began to import coking coal used for coking and raw materials for the steel industry such as iron ore and manganese ore into Japan as "aid" materials. Taking coking coal as an example, according to the second white paper of the Japanese government, it was almost not imported in 1946 and 1947. In 1948, it suddenly increased to 3.6 percent of the total imports, and in 1949, it further increased to 5 percent. Ninety percent of these coking coal came from the United States, and a considerable part of them were treated as "aid" materials. Therefore, before the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, the development of Japan's basic military industry—the steel industry—was directly proportional to the "relief" of the United States to Japan. In 1946, the total amount of "aid" from the United States to Japan was 290 million U.S. dollars, which increased to 460 million U.S. dollars in 1949 (Asahi Economic Yearbook of 1950). That is to say, the "relief funds" given by the United States to Japan in 1949 increased by nearly 60 percent compared with 1946. The annual output of Japanese steel also increased from 510,000 tons in 1946 to about 2.5 million tons in 1949, expanding by nearly four times. The conspiracy of the United States to restore Japan's military industry by hook or by crook in the name of "relief" has been fully exposed since the launch of the war of aggression against Korea at the end of June last year. Today, even the United States admits that Japan is the military supply base of the U.S. military closest to the battlefield. The formation of this military supply base is certainly not a day's work, but was promoted by the "active relief" of the United States to Japan since 1948.
    Based on the above-mentioned part of the facts, we are enough to see how much evil these Wall Street butchers, who kill without seeing blood, have done by stealing the taxes of the American people in the name of relieving Japan! They are achieving the goal of destroying the country and exterminating the species of Japan under the mask of philanthropists. However, today, these shameless guys dare to openly reverse black and white and confuse right and wrong in broad daylight, saying that this is the "relief" of the United States to Japan, and that this part of the debt will not have to be repaid in the future, in an attempt to deceive the Japanese people. Was Japan saved by the United States, or did Japan enrich Wall Street? The facts are obvious to all. Moreover, whose hands are in control of Japan's economic lifeline and even all political and military affairs today? It is also clear at a glance. Can the United States cover up all the evils it has done in Japan with just a piece of blank paper on the draft of the "Peace Treaty" with Japan? We Chinese people have seen through this trick that U.S. imperialism is accustomed to playing. Today, only when all Asian people unite to oppose the U.S. separate peace with Japan, oppose arming Japan, and finally drive the U.S. robbers out of the East, can we have a truly peaceful and happy life.

　　究竟是美国救济了日本
　  还是日本喂肥了华尔街？
    庄涛
    华尔街的代理人——美国反动政府，在它片面制订的《对日和约草案》第六章中，堂皇地写着：“日本无力”“履行其对于自一九四五年九月二日起为进行占领目的所给与的救济与经济协助之义务”。换句话说，就是：美国姑念日本贫苦，今后如和约签订，过去因“救济”及“经济协助”所形成的日本对美国的债务，可以一笔勾消。真是好一个慷慨的慈善家！然而美帝国主义的任何花言巧语，是不能掩蔽世界人民的耳目的。请看看这位“慈善家”的本色吧！
    什么是美国为进行占领目的所给予日本的“救济”与“经济协助”呢？这就是指一九四五年九月二日以来，从美国历年岁出的“占领区救济费”与“占领区经济复兴费”内，拨给日本的部分。这笔款项，在一九四九年四月日美双方缔结的《阿波丸协定》的最后了解事项中，规定为日本对美国的有效债务的一部分。据一九五○年日本朝日经济年史所载，截至今年六月底，总额将达二十亿二千四百万美元。如以一美元合三百六十日元的日本官方汇率计算，则合七千三百亿日元，超过今年日本的预算总额。所以这是一笔不小的数目。这笔钱是由美国反动政府向美国人民勒索来的，可是一到华尔街大亨们手里，便成了在“救济”、“援助”等美名掩盖下的、对日本人民进行残酷榨取以至灭亡日本的手段。
  借“救济”之名推销剩余物资
    战后美国历年拨给日本的所谓“占领区救济费”或“占领区经济复兴费”，日本本身是毫无过问之权的。这笔美国人民的血汗，一开头就在“援助”日本人民的幌子下，落入了华尔街大亨们的腰包。然后根据他们赚钱的方便，向日本输出所谓“援助”物资。所以自从一九四五年九月二日麦克阿瑟代表盟国进驻日本以后，就着手借“救济”之名替华尔街倾销剩余物资。
    推销得最多的是美国小麦和美国棉花。据去年五月日本政府发表的第二次贸易白皮书所载，一九四九年日本食粮的输入占输入总额的百分之四十一，其中百分之七十五来自美国；纤维类（主要为棉花）的输入占输入总额百分之二十四，其中棉花的百分之八十来自美国；这些输入的大部分都由“援助费”支付。大家都知道，一九四八年以来由小麦、棉花等价格暴跌而形成的美国农业恐慌，正是加深战后美国经济危机的一个因素。所以华尔街便借“救济”之名输出大量小麦与棉花，这样既可掠夺美国人民的大笔税收，又能起稳定国内小麦与棉花的高度垄断价格的作用。因此它对日本的“救济”曾达到这样“热心”的地步：拿食粮来说，一九四九年日本本预定输入食粮二百四十万吨，但到一九四九年度末（即一九五○年三月底），日本输入的食粮已达三百八十万吨，超过预定计划百分之五十以上。结果日本等于输入了农业恐慌，促成农产物价格的暴跌。去年初的日本黑市米价，甚至跌到公定价格以下，造成日本农村破产，使不少农民被迫出卖亲生的儿女。
  借“救济”之名实行重利盘剥
    这批借“救济”之名输入日本的物资，不仅是美国的剩余物资，而且实际上是对日本人民的重利盘剥。其价钱之高，听了使人咋舌。只拿小麦来说，一九四九年美国强制日本输入的小麦，每日石为五千四百日元，而当时日本政府向日本农村征购的小麦，则每日石为二千三百三十三日元，仅合美国小麦输入价格的百分之四十三。那末这样一来，美国小麦在日本的销路不是要受到很大阻碍了吗？但是华尔街又有其他毒辣的办法，这就是由日本政府按每日石五千四百日元的高价向美国购进小麦，然后还是按一般市场价格向全国出售，中间每日石亏损的将近一半的钱，便由取自日本人民的岁出中开支。结果一九四九年，仅日本国库开支的输入食粮补助费一项，就达四百八十七亿日元，占那一年日本岁出的将近百分之七。同年日本国库为文化、教育、劳动、保健而支出的社会及劳动施设费与保健卫生费二项合计，也不过三百二十亿日元，占该年岁出的百分之四点六左右。
    更骇人听闻的还有运费方面的重利盘剥。例如一九四九年，红海盐的产地价格为每吨四块四角美元，但一经美国船运到日本，每吨输入价格就涨到十八块五角美元。结果美国所收的运费与佣金，占输入价格的将近百分之八十。因此就连三菱财阀系的日本邮船会社社长浅尾也不得不说：“西欧各国马歇尔计划援助资金的相当部分，作为输送援助物资的运费而直接失去；日本也是如此，本年度对日援助资金的过半，作为海上运费而支付了。”（一九四九年十一月十日日产协月报）
  借“救济”之名控制日本经济命脉
    但是华尔街大亨们还不甘心，从一九四九年起，又设立了所谓“美援对等资金”制度。这就是说，这批重利盘剥的过剩物资到了日本以后，还得立刻折成日元现款，转入日本特别会计预算的收入部分，称为“美援对等资金”，完全归美国支配，根据美国的命令投入各产业部门。截至一九五○年九月，美国实际上已共投下一千四百五十二亿日元。这笔钱有一半直接投入电气通信、铁路、电力、海运、煤炭、钢铁、化学等日本基本产业部门。如加上投入金融部门而成为对日本工业的间接投资的部分，则对日本基本产业部门的投资，占投入的“美援对等资金”总额的百分之九十。这样美国实际上已经完全控制了日本的经济命脉，达到使日本亡国的目的。拿一九四九年来说，日本电气通信建设费的百分之八十，国家铁路建设费的百分之九十五，都是由“美援对等资金”支付的。
  借“救济”之名恢复日本军事工业
    最后不得不引起我们注意的。就是从一九四八年我们中国人民的革命胜利日益扩大的时候起，美国开始把炼焦煤用的粘结煤以及铁矿、锰矿等钢铁工业的原料，作为“援助”物资输入日本。仅拿粘结煤来说，据日本政府第二次白皮书所载，在一九四六年、一九四七年几乎没有输入，至一九四八年，突然增至占输入总额的百分之三点六，到一九四九年，更增至百分之五。这些粘结煤的百分之九十来自美国，其中相当部分是作为“援助”物资处理的。因此在美国发动侵朝战争以前，日本基本军事工业——钢铁工业的发展，是和美国对日本的“救济”成正比例的。一九四六年美国对日的“援助”总额为二亿九千万美元，至一九四九年增至四亿六千万美元（一九五○年朝日经济年史）。这就是说，一九四九年美国给予日本的“救济费”，比一九四六年增加将近百分之六十。而日本钢材的年产量，也就由一九四六年的五十一万吨，增至一九四九年的二百五十万吨左右，扩大了将近四倍。美国这种处心积虑地借“救济”之名恢复日本军事工业的阴谋，到去年六月底发动侵朝战争以后，已暴露无遗了。今天连美国也承认日本是美军最接近战场的军需补给基地。这个军需补给基地的形成，当然不是一天之功，而是一九四八年以来，美国对日“积极救济”所促成的。
    根据以上列举的一部分事实，我们已足以看出这批杀人不见血的华尔街屠夫们，借救济日本之名，不仅窃取了美国人民的税收，而且又借此做了多少罪恶的勾当！他们是在慈善家的假面具下，达到使日本亡国灭种的目的。然而今天这批丧尽廉耻的家伙，竟还敢在光天化日之下，公开颠倒黑白、混淆是非，说这是美国对日本的“救济”，说这部分债务今后可以不要还了，妄图借此蒙蔽日本人民。究竟是美国救济了日本，还是日本喂肥了华尔街？事实是有目共睹的。而且今天日本的经济命脉以至一切政治、军事，已经操于何人之手？也是一目了然的。美国仅凭一纸对日《和约草案》的空文就能把它在日本所做下的一切罪恶掩盖起来吗？我们中国人民已经看透了美帝国主义惯于玩弄的这套把戏。今天只有一切亚洲人民联合起来，反对美国对日单独媾和，反对武装日本，最后把美国强盗逐出东方，我们才能有真正和平、幸福的生活。
