    China Salt Industry Company Accepts Readers' Suggestions
    Plans to Improve Salt Supply in Qian'an and Other Places

    Editor:
    We consider the suggestions from the Tangshan Prefectural Administrative Office's Industry and Commerce Section published in your newspaper's reader's letters column on March 28th, regarding expanding the salt sales organization in the Tangshan area, and the editor's note, to be very valuable. According to a letter from the Tianjin Salt Company, which is directly under our company: "In addition to the existing Tangshan Branch Company, the three groups in Zunhua, Luanxian, and Yahongqiao, and the Qinhuangdao sales agency, we are planning to establish a formal salt sales organization in Qinhuangdao to supply the civilian needs of Changli, Funing, and other counties. As for the mountainous areas such as Qian'an, we have indeed not given them enough attention. Because Hebei Province is preparing to establish a comprehensive sales company here, we did not plan to establish another organization. After the comprehensive company is established and establishes a business relationship with our company, the salt supply problem for the people in the mountainous areas can be solved." Our company has now instructed the Tianjin company to send people to contact the Tangshan Prefectural Administrative Office, based on readers' suggestions, to consider establishing salt sales organizations in mountainous areas such as Qian'an and Zunhua.

### 中国盐业公司接受读者建议  拟改进迁安等地食盐供应

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中国盐业公司接受读者建议
    拟改进迁安等地食盐供应编辑同志：
    贵报三月二十八日读者来信专页载唐山专署工商科建议扩大唐山专区销盐机构的意见及编者按语，我们认为是很宝贵的。据本公司直属天津盐业公司来信报告：“唐山专区售盐机构除现有唐山支公司、遵化、滦县、鸦红桥三个小组及秦皇岛代销店外，最近拟在秦皇岛成立正式销盐机构，供给昌黎、抚宁等县的民需。至于迁安等山地，我们确实照顾得不够。因为河北省准备在这里设立一揽子性质的售货公司，所以我们就没有计划另立机构。俟一揽子公司成立，与我公司建立业务关系后，即可解决山区人民的食盐问题。”现本公司已指示天津公司，根据读者建议，派人与唐山专署接洽，考虑在迁安、遵化等山区建立销盐机构问题。
