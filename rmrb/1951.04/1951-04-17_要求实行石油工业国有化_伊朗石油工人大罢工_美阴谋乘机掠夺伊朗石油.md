　　Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: The strike of Iranian oil workers is expanding. On April 12th, more than 20,000 workers from the Abadan refinery in southern Iran and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company went on strike again. The authorities attempted to sabotage the strike, resulting in huge clashes and bloodshed. As a result, one Briton was killed and two British residences were destroyed. Many striking workers and local residents were shot and killed or wounded by military police. Many people were arrested in Abadan and Bandar-e Mashur.
    The just struggle of the Iranian oil workers has once again received strong support from the broad masses of the Iranian people. On April 12th, students at the University of Tehran went on strike for a day in support of the striking workers. On April 13th, 40,000 working people in Tehran held a mass rally in the square in front of the parliament to support the striking workers of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The conference resolved that the demands of the striking workers of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company must be met immediately: to abolish martial law and guarantee democratic freedom; to demand that Anglo-American imperialists must stop infringing upon Iran's national independence.
    The strike of the Iranian Anglo-Iranian Oil Company workers began on March 20th. 20,000 people participated in the strike, including workers from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's Abadan refinery, the largest refinery in the world, and workers from other business departments. The striking workers demanded that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company abolish the decision to cut wages and demanded the nationalization of the oil industry. Under the pressure of the demands of the Iranian oil workers and the people of the whole country, the Iranian Parliament passed a bill on March 20th to nationalize the Iranian oil industry, which accounts for 24 percent of the world's total output. The bill stipulates the organization of a committee to study the issue of taking over the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company within two months. After this, Britain suggested that it could share the company's profits equally with the Iranian government, while sending two more warships to the Persian Gulf in an attempt to prevent the implementation of the oil nationalization bill. On the other hand, US imperialism is also trying to seize Britain's position in Iran. They collude with the current Iranian government and attempt to hand over the management of the oil industry to American "experts" after the Iranian government nationalizes the oil industry. This has aroused the resolute resistance of the Iranian people to Britain's opposition to oil nationalization and the United States' attempt to seize the fruits of the Iranian people's struggle.

　　要求实行石油工业国有化
    伊朗石油工人大罢工
    美阴谋乘机掠夺伊朗石油
    【新华社十五日讯】伊朗石油工人的罢工正在扩大中。四月十二日，伊朗南部阿巴丹炼油厂和英伊石油公司等厂的工人两万余名，再度举行罢工。当局企图破坏罢工，因而引起巨大的冲突与流血事件。结果有一个英国人被杀，两个英国人的住宅被捣毁。很多罢工的工人和当地的居民，被军警开枪打死或打伤。在阿巴丹和班达·玛沙两地，很多人被逮捕。
    伊朗石油工人的正义斗争，再次获得了伊朗广大人民的有力支援。德黑兰大学学生于十二日罢课一日，声援罢工工人。十三日，德黑兰的劳动人民四万人，在国会前面的广场上举行群众大会，支持英伊石油公司各企业的罢工工人。大会决议坚持英伊石油公司罢工工人的要求必须立刻得到满足：要求取消戒严令，保障民主自由；要求英美帝国主义者必须停止侵犯伊朗的国家独立。
    伊朗英伊石油公司工人的罢工开始于三月二十日。参加罢工的有两万人，其中包括英伊石油公司设在阿巴丹的世界最大的炼油厂的工人以及其他企业部门的工人。罢工工人要求英伊石油公司取消关于削减工资的决定，要求石油工业国有化。在伊朗石油工人和全国人民的要求的压力下，伊朗国会于三月二十日通过了把占世界总产量百分之二十四的伊朗石油工业收归国有的法案。该法案规定组织一委员会，以两个月的时间研究关于接收英伊石油公司的问题。在此以后，英国即一面建议可与伊朗政府平分该公司的利润，一面增派军舰两艘到波斯湾，企图以此来阻止石油国有化法案的实行。另一方面，美帝国主义者亦力图乘机攫取英国在伊朗的地位。它们勾结伊朗现政府，企图在伊朗政府把石油工业收归国有后，交给美国“专家”来管理。这样，就引起了伊朗人民对于英国反对石油国有化和美国乘机攫取伊朗人民斗争果实的坚决反抗。
