　　Books on Agricultural Improvement and Agricultural Production
         "Rural Propaganda Work"
         Edited by the Northeast General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore, October 1950 Edition
         32mo, 51 pages, basic price originally 130 Northeast Yuan
         "How Rural Branches Lead Production"
         Compiled by the Organization Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Xinhua Bookstore Northeast General Branch
         October 1950 Edition, 32mo, 53 pages
         Basic price originally 140 Northeast Yuan
    This spring, many areas have completed land reform, and the vast number of farmers have been allocated land. The main problem facing these areas now and in the future is how to inspire the farmers' enthusiasm for production, and thus how to carry out propaganda and leadership. The above two books are the best reference books for rural cadres in areas after land reform to carry out propaganda and leadership.
    The first book is a summary of the rich experience accumulated by the Propaganda Departments of the CPC Provincial Committees of Heilongjiang Province, Songjiang Province, and Jilin Province in the rural propaganda work of various counties. It simply introduces and explains the content, methods, and future requirements of propaganda, with particularly numerous introductions to the experience of propaganda methods. According to their experience, oral propaganda is the most effective. The book cites many practical examples of oral propaganda, which are very interesting. These interesting and effective experiences are worth learning and promoting.
    The latter book introduces the experience of model rural branches in leading production in various parts of Northeast China. These rural branches are able to lead well and become model branches because they can all "firmly grasp the basic policy of the Party's rural work after the land reform, which is to develop agricultural production," can all put forward specific methods to expand production and increase income that are urgently required by the masses based on the specific conditions of their village, can all personally participate in production and lead production, and can all unite with others to implement collective leadership. The methods of "helping hooligans transform" and the establishment of "flexible production groups" introduced in this book are all valuable experiences, and rural cadres in various places should refer to and absorb them in suitable local conditions.
    In the rural areas led by these model rural branches, a new atmosphere of rapid and universal rise has emerged in agricultural cultivation, sideline business, actual income, and cultural education, all of which are illustrated with specific situations in the book. This shows that the people's power and land reform have opened up a path of prosperity and rise for the countryside. As long as the rural cadres lead well and can mobilize the farmers' enthusiasm for production, rural prosperity will surely be realized.

        "On the Mass Line for Agricultural Technology Improvement"
    Written by Zhang Qingtai, published by Fifty's Publishing House, September 1950
    36mo, 36 pages, basic price 2 yuan
    This book is written by the author based on the summary of practical work experience. It expounds the mass line for improving agricultural technology, and also criticizes the erroneous views of bourgeois agricultural science and the old-fashioned style that still exists today. It has great guiding significance both theoretically and practically. Based on the facts, the author correctly pointed out: "The peasant masses have rich experience and creativity, and only need scientific theoretical guidance. For example, Wang Zhengnian, a poor peasant in Panshan County, has created cotton grafting, Jiang Qing, a farmer-born district cadre in Hailun County, has created hybrid corn, and many farmers have inventions for the prevention and control of crop diseases and insect pests, all of which show the great wisdom of the peasant masses." Therefore, "the promotion and improvement of agricultural technology cannot be just a matter for agricultural technology cadres. All rural workers should be good at summarizing the production experience of the masses, learning agricultural technology from the masses, and educating the masses to improve agricultural technology." He also pointed out: In order to improve and promote agricultural technology, and in order to lead agricultural production well, "close contact between agricultural technology cadres and rural work comrades is one of the important links."
    The book also puts forward some valuable opinions to the cadres of agricultural experiment stations, pointing out that they should not start from subjective wishes, aim too high, and meddle in everything, but should stand on the position of serving the people, "start from reality, start from the needs of the masses; according to needs and possibilities, distinguish priorities and urgencies, and take care of various specific conditions (including human, material, and technical conditions), and focus on the several major objects that are most related to people's lives as the center of experimental research." At the same time, he also quoted a famous saying by Michurin to specifically illustrate the above opinions, saying: "We don't need delicate, aristocratic plants, we need worker-like plants, plants that are strong in themselves. What we need is something for everyone, not for a few." The opinions put forward by the author and Michurin's passage can be used as mottos for our cadres engaged in rural work, and are worthy of special pondering and attention.      (Liu Jichen)
  "The People's Academy of Sciences"
    Written by Su and Fei, translated by Nan Qian, published by Sanlian Bookstore, June 1950
    32mo, 157 pages, basic price 5.70 yuan
    This book is a story about grain production increase in the Soviet Union written in the style of a novel. In terms of books on agricultural production increase, it is rare to find one that is both rich in correct content and engaging.
    The whole book narrates the vivid struggle facts of the Soviet Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, led by Lysenko, accepting Stalin's great call, mastering Michurin's biological science theory, combining the strength of collective farmers, and implementing the resolution of the 1938 Soviet Supreme Soviet on increasing the yield of millet. The victory of this struggle enabled millet (translated as millet in the original book), which had always been considered a "low-grade" crop and the lowest-yielding crop in the Soviet Union, to increase from an average yield of 3.3 quintals per hectare (equal to 15 Chinese acres) in 1937 to an average yield of no less than 15 quintals per hectare in an area of 500,000 hectares in 1939, and even reached 206 quintals per hectare in individual harvests a few years later. This book tells us how this new record was created successfully.
    The beginning of the book narrates the process of millet cultivation in the Soviet Union, which was promoted due to the frequent droughts in Russian history. Due to the lack of reasonable management, the annual yield can only be said to be better than no harvest at all; therefore, ordinary farmers despise millet and treat it as a "compensatory" crop.
    The people's leader Stalin recognized that "drought is teaching us to build agriculture," and that millet is a good grain and feed crop that can resist drought. For the needs of the people, he pointed out that its yield should be increased in the dry areas of southeastern Soviet Union, and designated the Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences to undertake this great task.
    After accepting this task, Lysenko first sent people to the millet-producing areas to identify the reasons for the crop failure. Lysenko himself stayed in Moscow, conducting rigorous research in the laboratory and humbly consulting experienced farmers to summarize their experience. Finally, he combined the data from field investigations and research with the experience from the masses, and improved and organized it into a new method theory. This theory of combining science and practice convinced him that the yield could be increased five or six times in one year. However, after he issued the call, he was opposed and criticized by some scientific doctors who still retained conservative ideas, and even jointly accused Lysenko of only being able to ruin all millet crops, and it was impossible to increase the yield by five or six times in an area of 500,000 hectares within one year.
    With ideological leadership and the strength of the masses, Lysenko did not bow to those "scientific doctors." When the comrades engaged in research work inevitably had some questions and concerns in their minds when participating in this great practical production movement, Lysenko correctly instructed: "It will enable you to create the science of millet"; "You are going there to prove with practice and establish the scientific theory. The correctness of our theory will be proved on the fields of collective farms. Your work should win the collective farmers' respect for science, and not separate them from science." He also said: "You will complete a glorious mission - teach the people how to control nature."
    In 1939, a struggle was launched in an area of 500,000 hectares to increase the yield of millet to no less than 15 quintals per hectare. The book narrates in detail several typical deeds in this great scene. Not only scientific workers, agricultural experts, and mechanical experts participated in this work, but mainly tens of thousands of men, women, and children collective farm members, who organized 40,000 cultivation teams to cooperate.
    The book also describes in detail the creative activities of two labor heroes and a retired soldier in the struggle to increase yields, which is also a very important link in the whole book.
    The book also tells many interesting stories about agricultural machinery and fertilization.
    This book is a good book that agricultural experts, professors, technicians, administrative cadres, agricultural association cadres, students, and farmers should carefully read and study. Because the whole story of the book is to instruct the specific methods and ways in which to carry out the theory of mastering Michurin's doctrine with Marxism-Leninism as the ideological weapon in agricultural production practice. It clearly points out the answers to the following series of questions: How to follow the mass line in production practice? How to organize and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses? How to summarize and improve the experience of the masses? How to test agricultural theory in practice? How should scientific workers humbly learn from the masses and raise their experience to theory? How can the masses master science and become a weapon for production? This series of questions should be considered by our agricultural workers.        (Chen Yiqian)

    Editor's note: There is another Chinese translation of this book: "The Story of Soviet Grain Production Increase", translated by Qian Zhenhu, first published by Shanghai Qiming Bookstore in May 1950, 110 pages. Basic price 5.5 yuan.

　　关于农业改进和农业生产的书
         《农村宣传鼓动工作》
         新华书店东北总分店编辑  一九五○年十月版
         三十二开  五一页  基价原东北币一三○元
         《农村支部怎样领导生产》
         中共中央东北局组织部编  新华书店东北总分店

    今年春季完成土地改革的地区很多，广大的农民都分得了土地；这些地区，目前和今后主要的问题是在如何去启发农民的生产积极性，因而，也即是如何去宣传和领导。上列两本书，就是土地改革后地区农村干部宣传和领导的最好的参考书。
    第一本书是黑龙江省、松江省及吉林省中共省委宣传部对各县农村宣传鼓动工作所积累的丰富经验的总结。它把宣传的内容方法及今后的要求，都简单地做了介绍和说明，其中对于宣传方法的经验介绍的特别多。根据他们的经验，口头宣传收效最大，本书中举出许多口头宣传的实际例子，都是很有趣味的。这些富有趣味而收效最大的经验，值得学习和推广。
    后一本书，是介绍东北各地农村模范支部领导生产的经验的。这些农村支部所以领导的好而成为模范支部，是由于他们都能“紧紧的掌握了在土地改革后党对农村工作是发展农业生产的基本方针”，都能根据本村具体情况提出为群众所迫切要求扩大生产增加收入的具体办法，都能亲自参加生产和领导生产，都能团结别人实行集体领导。本书中所介绍的“帮助二流子改造”的方法和“死组活编”生产小组的编制，都是很有价值的经验，值得各地农村干部在适合地方情况下加以参考吸收的。
    这些农村模范支部所领导的农村，在农业耕作上，在副业经营与实际收入上，在文化教育上，都呈现出迅速普遍上升的新气象，书中均举出具体情况来。这说明了人民政权和土地改革已给农村开辟了繁荣上升的道路，只要是农村干部领导的好，能把农民生产的积极性发动起来，农村的繁荣一定会实现的。

        《论农业技术改进的群众路线》
    张庆泰著  五十年代出版社一九五○年九月版
    三十六开  三六页  基价二元
    本书是著者根据总结实际工作经验写成的。它阐述了改进农业技术的群众路线，同时又批评了资产阶级农业科学的错误观点和目前仍然存在的老一套作风，在理论上实际上都有很大的指导意义。著者根据事实正确地指出：“农民群众具有丰富经验与创造性，只是需要科学的理论指导，如盘山县贫农王正年有接种棉花的创造，海伦县农民出身的区干部姜庆有杂交苞米的创造，许多农民有防治作物病虫害的发明创造，都是表现了农民群众的伟大智慧。”因此“推广与提高农业技术，不能仅是农业技术干部的事情。所有农村工作者都应善于总结群众的生产经验，向群众学习农业技术，又教育群众提高农业技术。”并又指出：为了提高和推广农业技术，为了把农业生产领导的好，“农业技术干部与农村工作同志密切联系是重要环节之一”。
    本书还对于农业试验场的干部们提出一些宝贵的意见，指出：他们不应由主观愿望出发，好高骛远，东抓一下，西搅一手，而要站在为人民服务的立场上，“从实际出发，从群众的需要出发；根据需要与可能，分别轻重缓急，照顾到各种具体条件（包括人力物力与技术条件在内），抓紧关系人民生活最大的几种主要对象，作为试验研究的中心。”同时并引用了米邱林的一段名言具体地说明上面的意见说：“我们不需要娇嫩的贵族一般的植物，我们需要工人一般的植物，本身坚强的植物。我们需要的是那种为了每一个人的东西，不是为少数人的东西。”著者所提出来的这个意见和米邱林的这段名言，可当做我们从事农村工作干部的座右铭，是值得特别玩味和注意的。      （刘及辰）
  《人民的科学院》
    苏、费希著  南铣译  三联书店一九五○年六月版
    三十二开  一五七页  基价五·七○元
    这本书是以小说体裁写成的苏联谷物增产的故事。在有关农业增产的书籍方面，像这样既具有丰富而正确的内容，却又能引人入胜的，实不多见。
    全书叙述苏联列宁农业科学院以李森科为首的农业技术人员，接受斯大林的伟大号召，掌握米邱林生物科学理论，结合集体农民的力量，执行一九三八年苏联最高苏维埃会议关于增高黍稷产量的决议的生动的斗争的事实。这一斗争的胜利使在苏联一向被认为是“低等”作物，产量最低的一种农作物——黍稷（原书译为小米），从一九三七年每公顷（等于十五中国市亩）平均产量三·三公担（每公担约等于二百市斤）增为一九三九年在五十万公顷地区每公顷平均产量不少于十五公担以上，而且在几年后在个别的收获上竟提高到每公顷二○六公担。这本书就是告诉我们，这新纪录是如何创造成功的。
    本书的开始叙述了黍稷在苏联栽培的过程，那是因为俄国历史上经常性地发生旱灾而推广的，由于没有得到合理的经营，每年的产量只能说比完全没有收成好一点；所以一般农民都是卑视黍稷的，当作“弥补”作物来栽培。
    人民的领袖斯大林认定“旱灾正在教训我们建设农业”，黍稷是一种良好的粮食和饲料，能够抗旱的作物；为着人民的需要，他指出应在苏联东南部干燥地区提高它的产量，并指定列宁农业科学院担负这伟大的任务。
    李森科接受这种任务以后，首先派人到产黍稷区去鉴定这作物歉收的原因。李森科自己留在莫斯科，在研究室中进行严格的研究并虚心地向有经验的农民请教，总结他们的经验，最后结合了实地调查研究的资料和由群众中来的经验，提高和整理成为一套新方法的理论。这种科学与实践结合的理论使他确信可以在一年之中提高产量五六倍。但当他发出了号召之后，曾遭受一些残存着保守性思想的科学博士们的反对和指责，甚至于联名控诉李森科说他只能断送全部黍稷作物，绝不可能一年之内在五十万公顷的地区上增加产量五六倍的。
    有了思想领导，有了群众力量，李森科并没有向那些“科学博士”低头。当一般从事研究工作的同志，参加这伟大的实践生产运动，在思想上不免仍存在着一些问题和顾虑时，李森科正确的指示说：“它将使你们能够创造黍稷的科学”；“你们这一去是为了用实践来证明，确立科学的理论，我们的理论的正确性将在集体农场的田地上获得证明，你们的工作应该赢得集体农民对科学的尊重，不可使他们和科学分离。”又说：“你们将完成一件光荣的使命——教会人民怎样控制自然。”
    一九三九年在五十万公顷的地区上，展开了把黍稷提高每公顷不少于十五公担产量的斗争。这书很详细地叙述了这伟大场面中的若干典型的事迹。参加这项工作的不仅有科学工作者，农业专家，机械专家，主要还是成千成万男女老少的集体农场场员，组织了四万个耕作队配合来进行的。
    书中又详尽地叙述了两个劳动英雄和一个退役军人在提高收成斗争中的创造性活动，也是全书很主要的环节。
    关于农业机械和施肥问题，本书也讲了许多有趣的故事。
    这本书是不论农业专家、教授、技术员、行政干部、农会干部、学生以及农民们都应该仔细精读的好书。因为整本书的故事就是指示以马克思列宁主义为思想武器，掌握米邱林学说的理论，在农业生产实践行动中所进行的具体的方法和方式。它明白地指出下面这一系列问题的答案：在生产实践上如何走群众路线？如何有组织地发挥群众的积极性和创造性？如何总结和提高群众的经验？如何在实践中考验农业理论？科学工作者应该怎样虚心的向群众学习和把他们的经验提高到理论？怎样才能使群众掌握科学而成为生产的武器？这一连串的问题，都是我们农业工作者应该考虑的。        （陈宜谦）                  
    编者按：这一本书还有另外一个中译本：《苏联谷物增产故事》，钱振沪译述，上海启明书局一九五○年五月初版，一一○页。基价五元五角。
