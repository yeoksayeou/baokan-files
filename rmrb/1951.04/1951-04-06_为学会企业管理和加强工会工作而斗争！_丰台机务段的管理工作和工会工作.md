Strive to Learn Enterprise Management and Strengthen Trade Union Work!
  The Management and Trade Union Work of Fengtai Locomotive Depot
    By our reporter Chen Guohuang

  　A Stark Contrast
    Fengtai Locomotive Depot is a grassroots unit in the railway system, and its task is to operate and repair locomotives. The depot has a total of 1,114 employees. The depot was liberated on December 14, 1948. Before liberation, it had been subjected to the reactionary rule of British imperialism, the Northern Warlords, Japanese imperialism, and the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang took root here very early, with Kuomintang members accounting for 60% of the total number of people in the depot, including a small number of special agents. The feudal forces that colluded with the Kuomintang to oppress the workers were also very strong, such as the Qiao family workshop, the Li family airport, the Thirty-Six Friends, and the Northern Overlord, all of which were feudal forces that the workers hated. Under the oppression of internal and external reactionaries, the workers adopted a "go-slow" attitude to deal with the enemy, and production morale was extremely low. In the early days of liberation, the locomotives in the entire depot were not like locomotives at all. The average daily mileage (the number of miles a locomotive travels per day) reached a maximum of only 105.2 kilometers. Coal consumption was also very wasteful, and accidents occurred every day. By last year, the depot had completely changed. The daily mileage increased to 407.1 kilometers, coal consumption was reduced by half compared with the early days of liberation, and the quality of the locomotives was improved, reducing accidents. There were already ten locomotives that had traveled 100,000 kilometers without an accident, and one locomotive that had traveled 150,000 kilometers without an accident. Now the depot completes its tasks every month, and mostly overfulfills them. The depot completed all its tasks for the whole year of 1950 more than a month ahead of schedule.

  　Rely on the Working Class, Reform the Old System
    The main reason why Fengtai Locomotive Depot was able to change from the "decrepit and corrupt" past to today's "vigorous and vibrant" state is that the leading cadres of the depot initially implemented the policy of "relying on the working class to develop production."
    In the early days of liberation, the leading cadres of the depot tried all kinds of methods to get close to the workers and understand their demands. The leading cadres of the depot accepted the opinions of the workers and liquidated the cooperative controlled by the reactionary trade union before liberation, detained the special agents Tian Feng, Tian Shengqi, and others, and expelled six bad elements hated by the workers. The workers, who had been insulted and persecuted for decades, gradually raised their political consciousness through such struggles and realized that the Communist Party was their own party. The workers said, "This time, we feel relieved, we have truly turned over." Some said, "The Communist Party knows what we are thinking, the bad guys have been driven away, we are so happy to work." The workers began to realize their position as masters.
    Reforming the old bureaucratic management system and establishing a new democratic management system were important steps for Fengtai Locomotive Depot to realize democratic management. Fengtai Locomotive Depot promptly adjusted its personnel and removed redundant staff. In the past, the depot's transportation department had five non-productive supervisors who sat in the office every day, drinking tea and chatting. Their only job was to "supervise" the crew. After liberation, the depot transferred these five supervisors away. The depot also made appropriate arrangements for those who had been nominally paid salaries through personal relationships and bribery. In the past, the depot had 128 drivers, but only 66 of them regularly drove the trains, while the rest "only took salaries and did nothing." This unreasonable phenomenon has been changed. The depot has also initially adjusted the past very chaotic wage system.
    At the same time as reforming the old system, the depot established a Factory Management Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Management Committee). When the depot established the Management Committee in June 1949, the workers excitedly said, "We are really the masters of the locomotive depot!" The depot's Management Committee has a total of fifteen members, nine of whom are elected by the employees. The Management Committee meets once a week. Before the meeting, all members extensively collect opinions from the masses and bring them to the Management Committee for discussion. The Management Committee makes decisions, and the members convey them to the workers separately. The depot's Management Committee seriously discussed and decided on major issues related to workers' production. In June last year, one of the factory's electric picks (electric machines for repairing locomotives) broke down, so it could only complete half of the Class A locomotive inspection tasks (the factory only had two electric picks). The section chief brought this problem to the Management Committee for discussion: "The higher authorities want us to complete seven Class A locomotive inspections. One of our electric picks is broken, so we can't complete the task. What should we do?" Some members said, "According to the equipment capacity, we can only complete three and a half Class A locomotive inspection tasks." Some members said, "We ask the higher authorities to reduce the task!" At the meeting, worker members suggested: "We don't know the opinions of the masses yet, why don't we hand this problem over to the masses for discussion." The Management Committee agreed to this suggestion, and then convened a meeting of workers to raise this difficult problem. After several discussions, the workers came up with the method of "the machine doesn't rest when the man rests," and formed the workers using two electric picks into two shifts, day and night, taking turns using one electric pick, so that one electric pick could exert the effectiveness of two electric picks. But the workers thought, "I'm afraid the workers who make the accessories won't be able to keep up?" Therefore, they took the initiative to contact the accessory workers, explaining, "The higher authorities have difficulties, can we not overcome them?" The accessory workers said, "We will work harder, we guarantee you won't have to wait for the accessories." In this way, the task of inspecting seven Class A locomotives in June was finally victoriously completed by the workers. The Staff Representative Conference, which is the foundation of the depot's Management Committee, is led by the trade union and meets once a month. At the meeting, the section chief and other administrative cadres report on the work of the Management Committee, and listen to and answer the opinions raised by the masses. During the rectification movement last year, the administration asked the staff representatives to express more opinions according to the spirit of rectification. The staff representatives collected more than 400 opinions from the workers and gave them to the administration. The administrative cadres studied these opinions and answered them to the workers one by one. The workers were very satisfied and felt that "the leadership is not bureaucratic."

  Inspire Workers' Enthusiasm, Launch Production Competitions
    The workers of Fengtai Locomotive Depot were initially mobilized in the democratic reform movement. On this basis, the production movement was launched. The "Mao Zedong" locomotive came to Fengtai from Harbin, pointing out the direction of the production struggle for the Fengtai workers. Some drivers said, "The big brothers in the Northeast can turn broken locomotives into shiny 'Mao Zedong' locomotives, why can't we?" The workers automatically requested to repair a dilapidated and dead locomotive—the "No. 762" locomotive—into a brand-new and active locomotive. After this request was approved by the higher authorities, the workers were overjoyed and dedicated materials and tools. In their spare time, the workers and their families participated in this work. By the May 1st Labor Day in 1949, the "No. 762" locomotive was finally repaired by the workers and became the best locomotive in the entire depot. The workers selected conscientious and skilled drivers and stokers to drive this locomotive. Railway Minister Teng Daiyuan personally congratulated the workers and named the locomotive "May 1st Labor." The workers said with emotion, "The Minister personally congratulated us! We used to be called 'stinky workers,' but now our status has really improved!" Since then, the workers' production morale has been high, and production efficiency has risen again and again. In the same year, the depot mobilized the workers to repair another more damaged locomotive as a gift for the Party's birthday. This locomotive is the "July 1st" locomotive directly managed by the Ministry of Railways today. At the same time as reviving damaged locomotives, the workers launched a "Production and Savings Merit Movement" and waged a merciless struggle against wasteful phenomena in production. In May, June, and July 1950, the depot launched a vigorous production competition to create new records, and 41 workers created more than 120 new records. As one of the important contents of the new record creation movement, the depot launched a model locomotive team movement, which achieved great results. Model locomotives have accounted for 68.4% of all locomotives in the entire depot. In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes, Li Yong, the driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, called on railway workers to launch an over-axle movement. The workers of the depot responded first, and 15 locomotives implemented "over-axle." At the end of last year, the depot's locomotives towed more than 10,000 tons over the axle, increasing the country's transportation capacity. Recently, the workers of the depot challenged the Ma Hengchang team and put forward the resounding slogan of "uniting all employees and preparing for economic accounting." Some workers consciously helped the higher authorities to verify working hours and material consumption quotas.

  Implement the Responsibility System, Conclude Collective Contracts
    The quality of production performance is a sign of the democratization of enterprise management. After Fengtai Locomotive Depot launched the production movement, it universally implemented the responsibility system to consolidate the existing achievements. The depot's typical locomotive, "No. 1939," often had accidents in the past. Since the driver Li Yonglu took over the locomotive, there have been no accidents in the past two years, it has traveled safely for 150,000 kilometers, and it has often saved more than 10% of fuel. The implementation of the responsibility system—the contract repair system—in the locomotive repair factory has also consciously improved the workers' sense of responsibility: "The accidents of the locomotives we contract to repair are our shame." The Class A repair team of the depot is responsible for contracting to repair the "Mao Zedong" locomotive. Du Delin, the foreman of the Class A team, said, "We contract to repair the 'Mao Zedong' locomotive, we must guarantee its quality and never let it have an accident." Today, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive has traveled more than 230,000 kilometers without an accident. Because the depot implemented the responsibility system, the drivers and stokers who were originally enslaved by bad locomotives and old supervisors became conscious workers who managed the locomotives and created very good results: all the locomotives in the depot had traveled one million kilometers twice, with only two accidents occurring.
    The depot administration and the trade union concluded a collective contract. The second quarterly collective contract of the depot in 1950 stipulated that the administration "should be responsible for notifying the trade union of the monthly work plan two days in advance," and the trade union "should organize employees to discuss" when "receiving the administrative production plan" and "lead each team and individual to formulate collective production plans." In this way, the production plan stipulated by the administrative side became the production plan of the workers, and the workers knew how many tasks they should complete and what kind of quality they should guarantee, so their sense of responsibility was greatly improved. Last year, the depot concluded the second quarterly collective contract, and the workers overfulfilled the task. The contract stipulated that the production task for April was to complete a daily mileage of 328.5 kilometers, but it actually completed 407.5 kilometers. In the process of implementing the contract, the trade union checked the implementation situation and urged the administration to add safety railings to the coal platform, install screens in the workers' dormitories, and issue safety glasses to miners. The workers said, "The contract is really useful!" In the second quarterly collective contract, the workers saved more than 200 million yuan in material costs and received a large amount of bonuses.
    In addition, the depot promoted a rationalization proposal movement to improve production. In May, June, and July 1950, the workers put forward 54 rationalization proposals, 33 of which were adopted. The technical director said, "It's really good for production." The workers believe that "putting forward rationalization proposals is for our production."

  Cultivate Worker Cadres, Improve Trade Union Work
    In the production movement, Fengtai Locomotive Depot has produced many production models and advanced workers. The leading cadres of the depot have paid attention to cultivating and promoting worker cadres. Now, except for the section chief, the secretary of the General Party Branch, and the personnel director, who are external cadres, all the leading cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League at all levels in Fengtai Locomotive Depot are cultivated from the depot's workers. In the past two years, the depot has cultivated five section chief-level cadres, 38 director-level cadres, 38 foremen, and eight staff members from the workers. In addition, there are cadres from the Party and the trade union. For example, Li Yonglu, the vice chairman of the Beijing District Committee of the China Railway Trade Union, is a driver from the depot.
    In order to truly implement democratic management, trade union work must be done well, which is also proved by the experience of Fengtai Locomotive Depot. There are 87 trade union groups in Fengtai Locomotive Depot; three workshop committees are led by the grassroots trade union committee. Except for 110 apprentices who are applying for membership, all the rest of the employees have joined the trade union. The administrative cadres of the depot attach great importance to trade union work, which is one of the important factors for the good trade union work of Fengtai Locomotive Depot. The section chief of the depot said, "Without a trade union, it's like missing a leg." From the day the trade union was established in the depot, the Party and the administration have assigned capable cadres to the trade union. The administration also strongly supports the trade union's funding, purchasing equipment for the trade union, and allocating houses. The trade union cadres said, "The administration is really helpful!" The section chief also often goes to the trade union to understand the difficulties of the trade union. Every time the section chief receives a task from the higher authorities, he must first notify the trade union and consult with the trade union.

  Facing Production is the Primary Task of Trade Union Work
    The reason why the trade union has achieved results is basically because it has clarified the policy of "facing production." At the beginning of last year, the trade union of the depot formulated the 1950 production struggle goals. This is the key to the good trade union work of the depot. How does the trade union of Fengtai Locomotive Depot face production?
    After the trade union has grasped the production plan formulated by the administration, it first convenes the trade union committee for discussion, and then conveys it to each trade union group. Then, the trade union group convenes all employees to discuss the methods to complete the plan, and formulate monthly, ten-day, and daily production plans, and sometimes personal plans. In this way, the employees of the entire depot clarified their struggle goals.
    The trade union of the depot vigorously launched and led the workers' production competition, and paid attention to cultivating typical examples to promote production. The production competitions launched by the depot in the past two years have been led by the trade union. In the production competition movement, the depot has produced seven labor models, two of whom participated in the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers; 114 model workers and 27 advanced groups have also emerged.
    In order to ensure the completion of the production plan, the trade union of Fengtai Locomotive Depot mobilized the workers to formulate a set of necessary systems. In order to eliminate accidents and save fuel, the transportation department asked the crew to formulate a system on how to eliminate accidents and how to save fuel. Before the locomotive set off, the crew read these systems to ensure that everyone strictly abided by them. In order to eliminate counter-work phenomena, the factory department also formulated a swearing-in system before work. For example, the content of the oath of the Class A inspection team of the factory is: implement the "three no delivery" system: unqualified not delivered; heating of each department not delivered; leakage not delivered. Implement the five inspection system: after the work is done, hand it over to the foreman, inspector, crew, contract repair team and acceptance inspector for inspection. Implement the "three do not" system: sand casting with sand holes, lathe not required; lathe not standard, decoration worker not required; decoration unqualified, crew not required. In this way, the trade union of the depot mobilized the masses to formulate a system to consciously ensure the completion of the quantity and quality of products.
    The propaganda and mobilization work of the trade union of Fengtai Locomotive Depot has also played a great role in production. The main content of the propaganda and education work of the trade union of the depot is to commend advanced producers; criticize backward elements and encourage workers to do a good job in production. The depot has twelve types of written propaganda: big-character posters, wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, good news, clappers, slogans, congratulatory letters, mimeographed newspapers, red, yellow and black lists, red and black lists, locomotive competition boards, and commendation letters. In addition, there are broadcasts, celebration meetings, dramas and cartoons.

  Care for Workers' Welfare, Organize Workers' Mutual Assistance
    In addition, the trade union also timely solved the difficulties of workers' families and work. For example, the child of Liu Heting, the driver of the "No. 1939" locomotive, was sick, but he was busy with work and had no time to take care of the child. When the trade union learned about it, it immediately sent his child to the hospital. When the hospital had no medicine to treat it, the trade union sent someone to buy medicine in Beijing and cured the child. Liu Heting was very happy and worked harder. The smithy had no skylight, and the smoke filled the air, hindering work. The trade union negotiated with the administration and installed two skylights in the smithy. The grinding wheel in the factory had no protective cover, and sparks often got into the workers' eyes when grinding things, so the trade union told the administration and installed three protective covers.
    The trade union of the depot guarantees production in this way, so it can improve the workers' lives from the development of production. For example, from January to October 1950, the workers received a total of 390 million yuan in bonuses. The administration also continuously received bonuses and improved the workers' welfare.
    Under the principle of caring for workers' welfare and solving workers' difficulties as much as possible, the trade union of the depot also mobilized workers to use mutual assistance methods to solve their own difficulties and led workers to organize mutual aid societies. People who participate in the mutual aid society only need to pay a small amount of money to the society. If they encounter temporary difficulties, they can apply to the trade union group for approval and borrow money from the mutual aid society. In the past year, 3,400 workers borrowed money from the mutual aid society. The workers said, "This really solves the problem!" In the past, the workers' dormitories, canteens, auditoriums, etc. were either dilapidated or incomplete, and the administration was unable to solve them for a while. According to the workers' requests, the trade union mobilized the workers to use their spare time to dismantle the blockhouses built by the Japanese and Chiang in the past and use their bricks and wood to build a new auditorium and repair more than ten houses. When workers' families have major difficulties, such as death, illness, marriage, etc., the trade union can solve them immediately if it can; if it cannot solve them, it will mobilize everyone to help.
    Although Fengtai Locomotive Depot has initially implemented democratic management and has made great achievements in production, it still needs to make arduous efforts to further implement economic accounting. Therefore, it is necessary to absorb the past experience well, firmly rely on the working class, and do a good job in production.

　  丰台机务段的管理工作和工会工作
    本报记者　陈国黄
  　鲜明的对比
    丰台机务段是铁路系统的一个基层单位，它的任务是运用和修理机车，全段职工共有一千一百十四人。该段是在一九四八年十二月十四日解放的。解放之前，它曾受过英帝国主义、北洋军阀、日本帝国主义和国民党的反动统治，而国民党很早就在这里扎了根，国民党员占全段人数百分之六十，其中有少数的特务分子。和国民党勾结在一起压迫工人的封建势力也很强，如乔家车房、李家机场、三十六友、北霸天等，都是工人们所切齿痛恨的封建势力。在内外反动派压榨之下，工人以“磨洋工”态度对付敌人，生产情绪极其低落。解放初期，全段机车不像机车，机车的日车公里（一台机车每天走行的里数）平均最高仅达一○五点二公里，机车用煤也很浪费，并且天天出事故。到了去年，该段已完全变了样，日车公里提高到四○七点一公里，用煤量比解放初期减少一半，而且机车质量提高，减少了事故，走行十万公里无事故的机车已有十台，走行十五万公里无事故的机车也有一台。现在该段月月完成任务，并且多半超额完成任务，该段一九五○年全年各项任务均提前一个多月完成。 　 依靠工人阶级，改革旧制度
    丰台机务段之所以能从过去的“老朽腐烂”转为今天的“生气勃勃”，主要的原因是该段领导干部初步地执行了“依靠工人阶级，发展生产”的方针。
    解放初期，该段领导干部想尽了种种方法，和工人群众接近，了解工人群众的要求。该段领导干部曾接受了工人群众的意见，把解放前由反动工会所操纵的合作社清算了，把特务分子田丰、田盛齐等四人扣押起来，并开除了六名工人痛恨的坏分子。几十年来被侮辱被迫害的工人们经过了这样的斗争，逐步的提高了政治觉悟，认识了共产党是他们自己的政党。工人说：“这一下，咱们顺了气，真真翻身了。”有的说：“共产党知道咱心里事，坏家伙被赶走了，咱干活多高兴呵。”工人开始体会到主人翁的地位。
    改革旧的官僚的管理制度和建立新的民主的管理制度，是丰台机务段实现管理民主化的重要步骤。丰台机务段及时地调整了人事，把冗员去掉了。过去该段运转部门有五个不事生产的监工员，他们天天坐在办公室内，喝茶聊天，他们唯一的工作就是“监视”乘务员。解放之后，该段就把这五个监工员调走了。该段对于那些靠私人关系贿赂方法而挂名领薪的人，也作了适当的处理。过去该段有一百二十八个司机，而经常开车的只有六十六人，其余的人“只拿薪，不干事。”这种不合理的现象已经改变了。该段又初步调整了过去十分混乱的工资制度。
    与改革旧制度同时，该段建立了工厂管理委员会（下简称管委会）。该段在一九四九年六月成立管委会时，工人们激动地说：“咱们真的是机务段主人哪！”该段管委会共有十五个委员，其中有九个委员是由职工选举出来的。管委会每个星期开会一次。会议之前，所有委员都广泛地搜集群众意见，提到管委会上讨论。管委会作出决定，由委员们分别向工人传达。该段管委会认真讨论和决定了有关工人生产的重大问题。去年六月，该段工厂的电镐（检修机车的电动机器）坏了一台，因此，只能完成甲检机车任务的一半（该工厂只有两台电镐）。段长把这个问题提到管委会上讨论：“上级要我们完成甲检机车七台，我们坏了一台电镐，完不成任务，怎么办？”有的委员说：“按照设备能力，我们只能完成三台半甲检机车任务”，有的委员说：“我们要求上级减少任务！”会上，工人委员提议：“我们还不知道群众的意见，我们不妨把这个问题交给群众讨论。”管委会同意了这个意见，接着召集工人开会，把这个困难问题提出来，经过几次讨论，工人们想出了“歇人不歇马”的办法，把使用两台电镐的工人组成日夜两班，轮流使用一台电镐，使一台电镐发挥两台电镐的效能。但是工人们想：“恐怕制造配件的工友赶不上吧？”因此，他们主动地和配件工人联系，说明“上级有困难，咱们能不克服吗？”配件工人说：“咱们加油，包管你们不等配件。”这样，六月份甲检七台机车的任务，终于被工人们胜利地完成了。作为该段管委会的基础的职工代表会议是由工会领导的，每月开会一次。会上由段长和其他行政干部报告管委会的工作，并听取和解答群众提出的意见。去年整风运动时，行政上要求职工代表根据整风的精神多提意见，职工代表们便搜集了工人的意见四百多条，交给行政。行政干部研究了这些意见，逐一向工人解答，工人很满意，认为“领导不官僚”。
  鼓舞工人热情，开展生产竞赛
    在民主改革运动中丰台机务段的工人初步发动起来了。在这个基础上展开了生产运动。“毛泽东号”机车从哈尔滨来到丰台，给丰台工人们指出了生产斗争的方向。有些司机说：“东北大哥们能把破损机车变成亮堂堂的‘毛泽东号’，咱们怎么不能？”工人们自动地要求把一台破烂不堪的死机车——“七六二号”机车，修成一台崭新的活机车。这个要求被上级批准后，工人高兴万分，纷纷献交材料和工具。在业余时间内，工人和他们的家属都参加了这个工作。到一九四九年五一节，“七六二号”机车终于被工人修好了，并且变成全段最好的机车。工人们推选了有觉悟的技术好的司机和司炉来驾驶这台车。铁道部滕代远部长亲自向工人贺喜，并且命名这台车为“五一劳动号”。工人们感动地说：“部长都亲自给咱们贺喜啦！咱们过去被人叫作“臭工人”，现在地位真的提高啦！”从此以后，工人的生产情绪一直高涨，生产效率一再上升。同年，该段又发动工人修复了另一台更破损的机车，作为党的生日的献礼。这台机车就是今天铁道部直接管理的“七一号”机车。在复活破损机车的同时，工人们又开展了一次“生产节约立功运动”，向生产中的浪费现象作了无情的斗争。一九五○年五、六、七月，该段轰轰烈烈地展开了一个创造新纪录的生产大竞赛，四十一个工人创造了一百二十多件新纪录。作为创造新纪录运动的重要内容之一，该段曾展开模范机车队运动，获得很大的成绩。全段模范机车已占全部机车的百分之六十八点四。在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，“毛泽东号”机车司机长李永号召铁路工人开展超轴运动，该段工人首先响应，有十五台机车实行“超轴”。去年年底该段机车超轴牵引一万多吨，增强了国家大量的运输能力。最近该段工人又向马恒昌小组应战，提出了“团结全体职工，搞好经济核算制的准备工作”的响亮口号。有些工人自觉地帮助上级查定工时和材料消费定额。
  推行负责制，订立集体合同
    生产成绩的好坏，是一个企业管理民主化的标志。丰台机务段开展了生产运动以后，又普遍推行了负责制，把已有的成绩巩固下来。该段典型机车“一九三九号”，在过去常常出事故。自从司机李永禄包乘该车之后，两年来未出事故，安全走行了十五万公里，并经常节省燃煤百分之十以上。修理机车的工厂实行之负责制——包修制，工人们也自觉地提高了责任感：“咱们包修的机车，出了事故，就是咱们的耻辱。”该段包修组甲组负责包修“毛泽东号”机车，甲组的工长杜德林说：“咱们包修‘毛泽东号’，一定要保证它的质量好，决不让它出事故。”今天“毛泽东号”机车走行了二十三万多公里未出事故。该段由于实行了负责制，就使得原来被坏机车、被旧监工所奴役的司机和司炉成了管理机车的自觉的劳动者，创造了很好的成绩：全段所有机车曾两次走行了一百万公里，仅发生两次事故。
    该段行政和工会订立了集体合同。该段一九五○年的第二季集体合同规定：行政“应负责把每月工作计划在前二日通知工会，工会‘接到行政生产计划时，应组织职工讨论’，并‘领导各小组及各人订立集体生产计划’，这样，就使得行政方面规定的生产计划变成了工人群众的生产计划，工人们知道了他们应该完成多少任务和应该保证怎样的质量，因此，他们的责任心大大提高了。去年，该段订立了第二季的集体合同，工人们超额完成了任务。该合同规定四月份的生产任务是完成日车公里。三二八点五公里，但实际上完成了四○七点五公里。在执行合同过程中，工会检查了执行的情况，并督促行政增添了煤台的安全栏杆，装置了工人宿舍的纱窗，给矿工发了安全眼镜。工人说：“合同真顶事！”在第二季集体合同中，工人们节省了两亿多元材料费，得到了大批奖金。
    此外该段又推行了合理化建议运动，改进了生产。一九五○年五、六、七三个月内，工人提了五十四件合理化建议，其中三十三件，都被采用。技术主任说：“对生产真有好处。”工人认为：“提合理化建议，是为了咱们生产。”
  培养工人干部，健全工会工作
    在生产运动中，丰台机务段出现了许多生产模范和先进工作者。该段领导干部曾经注意培养和提拔工人干部。现在丰台机务段除段长、中共总支部书记和人事主任是外来干部外，所有党、行政、工会、青年团的各级领导干部都是从该段工人群众中培养出来的。两年多来，该段从工人中培养出来的段长级干部有五人，主任级干部三十八人，工长三十八人，各部门的干事八人，此外，还有党的和工会的干部。如中国铁路工会北京区委员会的副主席李永禄，就是该段的司机。
    为了真正贯彻管理民主化，必须做好工会工作，这也是丰台机务段的经验所证明了的。丰台机务段全段有工会小组八十七个；车间委员会三个，由基层工会委员会领导。职工中，除了一百一十名学徒工正在申请入会外，其余都参加了工会。该段行政干部很重视工会工作，这是丰台机务段工会工作作得好的重要因素之一。该段段长说：“没工会，就好像缺了腿。”从该段成立工会的那天起，党和行政都把有力的干部配备到工会中去。行政对于工会的经费也大力支持，替工会购用具，拨房屋，工会干部说：“行政真够帮忙！”段长又常常亲自到工会去了解工会的困难。段长每次接到上级任务时，必先通知工会，并和工会商量。
  面向生产是工会工作的首要任务
    该段工会之所以有成绩，基本上由于明确了“面向生产”的方针，去年年初，该段工会曾拟定了一九五○年生产奋斗目标。这是该段做好工会工作的关键。丰台机务段工会怎样面向生产呢？
    工会在掌握了行政上所订的生产计划之后，先召开工会委员会，进行讨论，然后传达给各工会小组，再由工会小组召集全体职工讨论完成计划的办法，并拟出每月、每旬、每日的生产计划，有时还拟出个人计划。这样就使得全段职工明确了奋斗目标。
    该段工会大力发动和领导了工人的生产竞赛，并注意培养典型，推动生产。两年来该段所展开的生产竞赛，都是工会领导的。在生产竞赛运动中，该段涌出了七名劳动模范，其中两名参加了全国工农兵劳动模范会议；还出现了一百十四名模范工作者和二十七个先进小组。
    为了保证完成生产计划，丰台机务段工会发动工人，制定了一套必要的制度。运转部门要消灭事故，节省燃煤，就由乘务员自己拟定怎样消灭事故，怎样节省燃煤的制度，在机车开出前，乘务员宣读这些制度，保证每人严格遵守。工厂部门为了消灭反工现象，也拟定了上班之前的宣誓制度。如工厂甲检组宣誓的内容是：实行“三不交”制度：不够标准不交；各部门发热不交；泄漏不交。实行五检制度：做完了活，交给工长、检查员、乘务员、包修组和验收员检查。实行“三不要”制度：翻砂有砂眼，镟床不要；镟床镟得不标准，装修工不要；装修得不合格，乘务员不要。该段工会就这样发动群众拟定制度自觉地保证完成产品的数量和质量。
    丰台机务段工会的宣传鼓动工作，对生产也起了很大的作用。该段工会宣传教育工作的主要内容是表扬先进生产者；批评落后分子，激励工人搞好生产。该段的文字宣传方式有十二种：大字报、壁报、黑板报、喜报、快板、标语、贺信、油印小报、红黄黑榜、红黑榜、机车竞赛板、表扬信。此外还有广播、庆功会、话剧和漫画等。
  关心工人福利，组织工人互助
    此外该段工会并及时地解决了工人家庭和工作的困难。如“一九三九号”机车司机刘贺廷的小孩有病，但他正忙于工作，没有时间照顾小孩。工会知道了，马上把他的小孩送到医院，医院没药治，工会便派人去北京城内买药，把小孩治好了。刘贺廷非常高兴，更加努力工作。铁匠房没有天窗，烟气弥漫，妨碍工作。工会向行政交涉，在铁匠房装置了两个天窗。工厂砂轮没有防护罩，磨东西时，火星常钻进工人眼里，工会便告诉行政，装置了三个防护罩。
    该段工会这样地保证生产，因此就能从发展生产中来改善了工人生活。比如一九五○年一月至十月，工人们所得的奖金达到了三亿九千万。行政上也不断地获得了奖金，改进了工人们的福利事业。
    在尽量关心工人福利，解决工人困难的原则下，该段工会并发动工人用互助方法解决自己的困难，领导工人组织了互助会。参加互助会的人只要向会里交很少的钱，遇到临时发生了困难，申请工会小组批准，即可向互助会借钱。去年一年之内，向互助会借钱的工人就有三千四百人，工人说：“这真解决问题！”过去该段工人宿舍、食堂、礼堂等，或是破烂不堪，或是残缺不全，而行政方面一时又无力解决。工会根据工人要求，发动工人利用业余时间，拆掉过去日、蒋修筑的炮楼，以其砖木新建了一座礼堂，还修补了十多间房屋。当工人家庭有重大困难时，如死亡、疾病、嫁娶等，工会能够解决的，立即解决；不能解决的，就发动大家帮助。
    丰台机务段虽然初步地实行了民主管理，生产工作也有了很大的成绩，但要进一步实行经济核算制还须作艰苦的努力。因此，必须很好地吸取过去的经验，牢牢地依靠工人阶级，把生产工作做好。
