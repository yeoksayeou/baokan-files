    Aunt Yao Catches a Spy
    Miao Di Zhao Zhifang 作

    (1) In a large courtyard near the Tianjin West Railway Station, lived more than a dozen families. There was Hei Liansheng who sold milk, Grandma Zhang Si who ran a mill, Shi Jintong who twisted hemp ropes, and Aunt Yao. They all got along very well.

    (2) In the northeast corner room of this courtyard lived a man named Yang Fazhang. He was a member of the Kuomintang and had worked in the puppet police force before liberation. After liberation, he pretended to be progressive and infiltrated the Revolutionary University to carry out espionage activities, and was captured by our public security organs. Last August, the government released him. The West Station Police Station held a mass meeting to announce his crimes and explained that he was a person under surveillance, and asked the masses to help the government monitor him. Comrades from the police station went to Aunt Yao's house and said to her, "You should pay more attention to that spy and monitor his behavior."

    (3) Aunt Yao thought of the past: her eldest son had been captured by the Japanese devils to work as a laborer, her second son pulled carts for others, and her husband rode a rickshaw, and the family could not even make ends meet. They were often bullied and beaten by the spy and his woman. ... Those days were truly unbearable! Thinking that the spy still wanted to destroy our good life, she felt very resentful.

    姚大娘捉特务
    苗地  赵志方 作
    （一）在靠近天津西车站的一个大杂院里，住着十几户人家。有卖牛奶的黑连升，开磨坊的张四奶奶，搓麻绳的史金桐和姚大娘。他（她）们相处得都很和气。
    （二）在这个院里的东北角屋里，住着一个叫杨法章的。他是国民党员，解放前干过伪保警队，解放后伪装进步，混入革命大学进行特务活动，被我公安机关捕获了。去年八月政府释放了他。西站派出所召开了群众大会，宣布他的罪状，并说明他是被管制分子，要求群众帮助政府监视他。派出所同志到姚大娘家里，对她说：“您应该多注意那个特务，监视他的行为。”
    （三）姚大娘想起了过去：大儿子曾被日本鬼子抓去当劳工，二儿子给人拉土车，老头子登三轮车，一家人吃穿都混不上。经常受特务和它的女人的欺侮与毒打。……那日子真不是人过的！想到现在特务还要破坏我们的好光景，她心里愤恨得很。
