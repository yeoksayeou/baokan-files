Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Paris, April 4th: The Four Foreign Ministers' Assistants meeting continued on the 2nd, chaired by French representative Baraduc.

Baraduc, representing the three Western powers, presented the following new proposals regarding the draft agenda for the Foreign Ministers' meeting:

"1. To consider the causes and effects of the current tense international situation in Europe, and the measures necessary to achieve effective and lasting improvement in relations between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, including the following relevant issues: current levels of armaments and armed forces of various countries, and measures to establish international supervision and disarmament and reduction of armed forces (including the armaments and armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France); eradication of German militarism; fulfillment of existing treaty obligations and agreements; elimination of the threat of war and fear of aggression. 2. To complete the Austrian State Treaty aimed at restoring the independence and democracy of Austria. 3. Various issues related to restoring German unity and preparing a peace treaty with Germany."

After the representatives of France, Britain, and the United States spoke successively to defend this draft, Soviet representative Gromyko made preliminary comments on the draft. He pointed out that in this draft agenda, the most significant issue of eradicating German militarism was relegated to a corner; the issues of reducing armed forces, establishing international supervision, and determining the levels of armaments and armed forces were also presented in a distorted way, as in the past, with the issue of armaments levels given first priority, followed by international supervision, while completely failing to mention what the supervision should be established for and why it should be implemented.

Gromyko pointed out that the Soviet delegation believes that reducing the armed forces of the four powers is the main issue to ensure peace.

Gromyko also pointed out that the new draft agenda of the three Western powers did not include the issue of fulfilling the part of the Italian peace treaty concerning Trieste. The three powers' representatives also did not answer the Soviet Union's proposal to consider the North Atlantic Treaty and the establishment of military bases by the United States in Britain, Norway, Iceland, and other European and Near Eastern countries. The Soviet delegation had pointed out that these issues were directly related to the causes of tension in Europe and the relations between the four countries.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Paris, April 4th: The Four Foreign Ministers' Assistants meeting held its twenty-second session on the 3rd, chaired by British representative Davies.

At the meeting, Soviet representative Gromyko urged the representatives of the three Western powers to note that many Soviet proposals had not yet been discussed in detail, such as the North Atlantic Treaty and the issue of the establishment of military bases by the United States in various countries. The Soviet delegation's proposal to include the part of the Italian peace treaty concerning Trieste on the agenda had also not been agreed upon.

In their speeches, the representatives of the three Western powers insisted that the draft agenda they had presented at the meeting on the 2nd included all the issues, and opposed including the above-mentioned issues proposed by the Soviet Union on the agenda.

Gromyko stated that the Soviet delegation could not agree with the views of the representatives of the three Western powers. He pointed out that the importance and urgency of the Trieste issue, which is directly related to international tension, has not diminished in the slightest at present. American and British troops are still stationed there, and defenses are being strengthened, turning it into an air and naval base for the United States and Britain; London is also busy carrying out diplomatic activities to undermine the Italian peace treaty concerning Trieste. Therefore, this issue must be studied by the four foreign ministers.

Gromyko then refuted Davies's claim that the Soviet proposal to study the North Atlantic Treaty and the issue of American military bases complicated the work of the meeting. He pointed out that the Soviet delegation believed that these proposals were of great significance, and that studying these issues by the Foreign Ministers' meeting would help improve relations between the four countries.

French representative Baraduc then spoke, repeating the worn-out clichés that the Soviet proposal on the North Atlantic Treaty and American military bases was for "propaganda purposes," and opposed the Soviet proposal.

After pointing out the absurdity of Baraduc's speech, Gromyko declared that the Soviet delegation reserves the right to make supplementary comments on the first point of the new proposal put forward by the representatives of the three Western powers on the 2nd.

　　葛罗米柯在四国外长助理会议发言
　  批评美英法新建议
　  指出肃清德国军国主义问题被忽视
    【本报讯】据新华社四日讯：塔斯社巴黎消息：四国外长助理会议于二日继续举行，由法国代表巴罗第任主席。
    巴罗第代表西方三国提出关于外长会议议程草案的新建议如下：
    “一、考虑目前欧洲国际局势紧张的原因和影响，及获致苏、美、英、法四国关系有效和持久的改善所必需的措施，其中包括下述有关问题：目前各国军备和军队水平以及建立国际监督和裁减军备及军队（包括苏、美、英、法四国的军备和军队）的措施；肃清德国军国主义；履行现存的条约义务和协定；消除战争威胁和侵略恐惧。二、完成旨在恢复独立和民主的奥地利的对奥和约。三、有关恢复德国统一及准备对德和约的各种问题。”
    在法、英、美三国代表相继发言为这个草案辩解以后，苏联代表葛罗米柯就该草案发表初步评论。他指出，在这个议程草案中，肃清德国军国主义这个最重大的问题被推到角落里；裁减军队、建立国际监督并确定军备和军队水平等问题也被本末倒置，像过去一样，第一位给予军备水平问题，其次才提到国际监督，而同时却完全不提应对什么建立监督和为什么要实行监督。
    葛罗米柯指出，苏联代表团认为，裁减四国军队是确保和平的主要问题。
    葛罗米柯并指出，西方三国的新议程草案没有包括履行对意和约中关于的里雅斯特部分的问题。三国代表也没有答复苏联所提出的考虑北大西洋公约以及美国在英国、挪威、冰岛和其他欧洲与近东国家建立军事基地的问题。苏联代表团曾指出，这些问题是与欧洲紧张局势的原因和四国之间关系的问题直接联系着的。
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎四日讯：四国外长助理会议于三日举行第二十二次会议，由英国代表戴维斯任主席。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯在会上促请西方三国代表注意，还有好多苏联的建议至今未详细讨论，如像北大西洋公约及美国在各国建立军事基地问题。苏联代表团要求把履行对意和约中关于的里雅斯特的部分列入议程的建议，也没有获致协议。
    西方三国代表在发言中硬说他们在二日会议上所提出的议程草案已包括了所有的问题，并反对把苏联建议的上述诸问题列入议程。
    葛罗米柯发言称：苏联代表团不能同意西方三国代表的观点。他指出：与国际紧张局势有直接关系的的里雅斯特问题，其重要性和紧迫性在目前毫未减少，该地仍然驻扎着美、英军队，并且正在加强防务，变为美英的海空军基地；伦敦也正忙于进行破坏对意和约中关于的里雅斯特问题的外交活动。因此，这个问题必须由四国外长加以研究。
    葛罗米柯接着反驳戴维斯所谓苏联关于研究北大西洋公约与美国军事基地问题的建议使会议的工作复杂化的说法，他指出：苏联代表团认为这些建议有着巨大的意义，由外长会议研究这些问题，会有助于四国关系的改善。
    法国代表巴罗第继起发言，他重复所谓苏联关于北大西洋公约和美国军事基地的建议是为了“宣传目的”的陈辞滥调，反对苏联的这个建议。
    葛罗米柯在指出巴罗第发言的荒谬性质以后宣称：苏联代表团保留对西方三国代表于二日提出的新建议中的第一点提出补充意见的权利。
