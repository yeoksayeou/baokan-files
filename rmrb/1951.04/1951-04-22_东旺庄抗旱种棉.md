　　(Sixteen) The next day, when the villagers from Wang Shan's mutual aid team arrived in the fields, they met Fang Luoyi, who was relying on the heavens for rain, also digging dry soil to get to moisture. He was very impressed that they could think of a way to use small sticks and water jugs to water and protect the seedlings.
    (Seventeen) After the cotton seedlings were watered, they grew very lushly. Wang Shan happily hoed the seedlings twice, but because the weather was unpredictable, he was afraid of damaging the cotton seedlings, so he left the seedlings very dense.
    (Eighteen) Two light rains came in the second half of the month, and Wang Shan finally thinned the seedlings, followed by applying cotton seed cake as top dressing. Second Aunt saw it and said, "There is no reason to apply strong fertilizer to cotton. People go crazy, and cotton will go crazy too!"
    (Nineteen) After applying the top dressing, Wang Shan also used tobacco water to treat the cotton aphids twice. The cotton grew very strongly. Fang Luoyi came over and said, "The plants are too far apart; I'm afraid they will develop 'plague' (meaning they will grow branches but not produce flowers)."

    （十六）第二天，王山互助组的老乡们一到地里，就碰上靠天等雨的房洛义，也在豁干购湿。他看到他们用小棍、水壶浇水保苗，心里很佩服他们能想办法。
    （十七）棉苗浇水之后，长得非常茂盛。王山高兴地锄了两遍苗，但是因为天气冷热不定，怕棉苗有损伤，苗儿留得还很密。
    （十八）下半月来了两场小雨，王山才定了苗，跟着施棉籽饼，上追肥。二大娘瞧见说：“棉花那有上壮肥的道理，人发疯，棉花也发疯了！”
    （十九）上过追肥之后，王山又用烟叶水连治了两次棉蚜。棉花长得很壮。房洛义走来说：“棵儿离得太远，恐怕要发瘟（长枝不结花的意思）。”
