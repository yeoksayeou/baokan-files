Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, April 9th: The 1951 spring project for the fundamental harnessing of the Huai River has fully commenced, with the exception of some technical aspects of the flood storage projects. In the three provinces along the Huai River—Henan, Northern Anhui, and Northern Jiangsu—a total of 1.4 million workers have arrived at the construction sites. A large quantity of engineering materials and tools are being transported from all over the country to the Huai River construction site.

The scale of the Huai River harnessing spring project is enormous. Under the unified leadership of the Huai River Harnessing Committee, the local workers began constructing embankments and dredging waterways more than a month ago. By the end of last month, construction of mountain valley reservoirs in the upper reaches and flood storage in the low-lying areas of the middle reaches had also commenced in part.

The construction of mountain valley reservoirs in the upper reaches and the flood storage projects in the middle reaches are the key to the entire Huai River harnessing project. The function of these projects is to intercept the floodwaters that the Huai River and its tributaries cannot discharge, proactively controlling the floodwaters in the mountain valley reservoirs or lake depressions during the flood season, thereby lowering the water level in the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River and ensuring the safety of the embankments in the middle and lower reaches. During the dry season, the stored water will be released back into the Huai River to facilitate navigation and irrigation. At present, the mountain valley reservoir projects that have commenced in the upper reaches of the Huai River are only a part of the overall project, mainly to gain experience for the large-scale construction of mountain valley reservoirs in the future. The reservoirs currently under construction are at Shimangpo (within Wuyang County), Banqiao (within Biyang County), and Baisha (at the intersection of Yuxian and Dengfeng Counties). The flood storage project in the middle reaches involves using the lakes and depressions on both banks of the Huai River in counties such as Huoqiu and Yingshang to intercept floodwaters. Currently, more than 100,000 workers have arrived at the construction site and begun earthwork operations. As for the large quantities of materials and tools required for the construction of the Runheji diversion sluice (part of the flood storage project), the Huai River Harnessing Committee is currently expediting the transportation of these items to the construction site from various sources.

In order to complete this year's Huai River harnessing spring project in a timely manner, the manpower and material resources mobilized by various localities to participate in the Huai River harnessing project are unprecedentedly large. Last winter, over ten thousand cadres from the three provinces along the Huai River went deep into the rural areas to carry out the mobilization and organization of workers. More than three thousand technical engineering personnel and water conservancy experts from all over the country, starting from late autumn and early winter last year, conducted on-the-spot surveys, measurements, planning, and design in the undulating mountainous areas of the upper reaches of the Huai River or in the lakes and marshes of the middle reaches, and formulated the entire plan for this year's spring project. Several thousand cadres specifically responsible for the supply of food to the workers transported large quantities of grain from North China provinces before the commencement of work, braving wind and rain, day and night. A large quantity of equipment and materials needed for the Huai River harnessing project was transported from more than a dozen large cities such as Shenyang, Qingdao, Wuhan, and Hangzhou. The Central and East China Postal and Telecommunications Departments recently dispatched a large number of telecommunications engineering teams, in cooperation with the engineering team of the Anhui Postal and Telecommunications Administration, using hundreds of thousands of catties of telecommunications equipment to set up more than a thousand li of new lines along both banks of the Huai River, strengthening the communication links for the Huai River harnessing project. The epidemic prevention team dispatched by the Central Ministry of Health, in cooperation with local Chinese and Western doctors, totaled more than a thousand medical workers, who established prevention stations or treatment centers at the construction sites where the workers were concentrated, to prevent and treat diseases for the workers. All of this has paved the way for the smooth progress of this unprecedentedly large-scale Huai River harnessing spring project.

Now, on both banks of the thousand-li Huai River, workers are gathered, and at a glance, various materials are piled up like mountains, red flags are fluttering in the wind everywhere, and there are endless rows of work sheds. The workers are carrying earth, shuttling back and forth. After receiving patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea, and protecting their homes and defending the country, many workers have extremely high work enthusiasm. They overcome various difficulties and launched a vigorous emulation drive on the construction sites. The work efficiency of the workers has therefore been unprecedentedly improved. The projects of restoring embankments and dredging waterways in various parts of northern Anhui in the middle reaches of the Huai River have now completed 24 million cubic meters of earthwork, about one-half of the planned amount. The project of repairing the canal embankments in the lower reaches of northern Jiangsu has also completed 1.7 million cubic meters of earthwork.

### 治淮春季工程全面开工　百四十万民工云集千里淮河两岸工地　在爱国主义热情鼓舞下展开立功竞赛

　　治淮春季工程全面开工
  　百四十万民工云集千里淮河两岸工地
  　在爱国主义热情鼓舞下展开立功竞赛
    【新华社蚌埠九日电】根治淮河的一九五一年春季工程，除蓄洪工程中的部分技术性工程外，其余工程现已全面开工。河南、皖北、苏北三个沿淮河的省区，先后到达工地的民工已有一百四十万人。大批的工程器材和工具，现正从全国各地源源运往淮河工地。
    治淮春季工程的规模非常巨大。在治淮委员会的统一领导下，早在一个多月以前，各地民工即开始修建堤防和疏浚河道等工程；至上月底，上游建筑山谷水库和中游的洼地蓄洪等工程，亦有部分开工。
    上游建筑山谷水库和中游的蓄洪工程是整个根治淮河工程的重点。这两种工程的作用在于拦蓄淮河干河及其支流所承泄不了的洪水，在汛期中主动地把洪水控制在山谷水库或湖洼地区，从而降低淮河中、下游的水位，保障淮河中、下游堤防的安全；到了淮河枯水时期，再将积蓄的水放入淮河，以便利航行和灌溉。现在，淮河上游已开始的山谷水库工程只是该项工程的一部分，主要是吸取经验，为将来大规模的建造山谷水库工程打下基础。现已开工的有石漫坡（舞阳县境）、板桥（泌阳县境）及白沙（禹县、登封两县交界处）三处水库。中游蓄洪工程是利用霍邱、颍上等县淮河两岸的湖泊和洼地拦蓄洪水，目前已有十多万民工到达工地，开始先作土方工程。至于建筑润河集分水闸（蓄洪工程的一部分）所需的大批器材和工具，治淮委员会现正加紧从各方面赶运到工地。
    为了能及时完成今年治淮的春季工程，各地动员参加治淮工程的人力和物力都是空前庞大的。去年冬季，沿淮河三省区共有上万的干部，深入到农村中去进行民工的动员和组织工作。来自全国各地的三千多名技术工程人员和水利专家们，从去年秋末冬初开始，就在淮河上游起伏的山地上，或是中游的湖沼洼地间，实地查勘、测量和规划、设计，制定了今年春季工程的全部计划。数千个专门负责民工粮食供应工作的干部，在动工以前，即不避风雨、不分日夜地从华北各省运到大批粮食。从沈阳、青岛、武汉、杭州等十几个大城市运到了大批治淮工程需用的器材和物资。中央及华东邮电部最近派了大批的电信工程队，配合安徽邮电管理局的工程队，以几十万斤的电信器材，在淮河两岸架设了一千多里的新线路，加强了治淮工程的通讯联系。中央卫生部派出的防疫队，配合当地的中、西医生，共有千名以上的医务工作者，分别在民工密聚的工地上成立了防治站或治疗所，为民工们防治疾病。所有这一切，为顺利进行这一空前规模的治淮春季工程铺平了道路。
    现在，千里淮河的两岸上，民工云集，一眼望去，各种物资堆积如山，到处是随风飘扬的红旗，和连绵不断的工棚。民工们抬土，往来如梭。许多民工经过抗美援朝、保家卫国的爱国主义教育以后，工作热情极高，他们排除种种困难，在工地上展开了热火朝天的立功竞赛运动。民工们的工作效率因而空前提高。淮河中游皖北各地的复堤和疏浚河道等工程，现已完成二千四百万土方，约完成计划的二分之一。下游苏北区培修运河堤防的工程亦已完成一百七十万土方。
