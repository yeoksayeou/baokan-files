The question of trade union funds
　　Dong Chu Ping
　　Trade union funds are the most important material foundation for consolidating and developing trade union organizations, and a basic link in trade union construction. The Central People's Government has included a special chapter in the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China to provide legal support and guarantee to trade union organizations in terms of material resources. In the past year, the general situation of administrative or capitalist parties allocating trade union funds is as follows: the old liberated areas are better than the newly liberated areas, large cities are better than small and medium-sized cities, state-owned enterprises are better than private enterprises, industry is better than commerce, and large industrial and commercial enterprises are better than small and medium-sized ones. In terms of trade union financial system, thanks to the correct leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, a national trade union financial conference was held, various methods for the collection and expenditure of funds were formulated, and the unified management of funds and the establishment of a trade union financial system began to be gradually implemented. However, judging from the implementation of the entire Trade Union Law, there are still quite common chaotic phenomena and some practical difficulties in the issue of trade union funds.
  I. The Capitalist's One-Sided View of Profit
　　Many capitalists still do not have a thorough understanding of the policy of "developing production and benefiting both labor and capital," and do not understand that developing production must rely on the working class. Therefore, they do not understand that paying trade union funds in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Union Law is not only an obligation they should abide by, but also something that is beneficial to them. Some capitalists in the Nanjing hat industry said, "The trade union is exploiting us!" The capitalist of Shanghai Yongsheng Thermos Factory said, "I have already fed them, and they still want to collect fees?" Some even provoked trade union cadres, saying, "If I pay to the bank, you still have to fill out forms to apply to the industrial trade union, which is troublesome; it's better to ask me directly, and I'll give you whatever you want." Most capitalists use methods of soft dragging and hard賴 to refuse to allocate trade union funds. Many people believe that "business tax can be delayed, and it doesn't matter if trade union funds are delayed." The capitalist of Shanghai Xiechang Sewing Machine Factory says "I will pay, I will pay" but never does. The capitalist of the Wuxing Company Silk Department is stubbornly赖, saying, "I am not breaking the law by being a boss. If I don't pay the cultural and educational fees, I will be sued, well then, I will go to jail." Some people are shrugging off responsibility to each other. Some capitalists in the Nanjing Steel Machinery Industry said, "Don't ask me to take the lead." The capitalist of Wuhan Yonglong Rice Mill said, "I will give if the Wuhan capitalists all give." Regarding the allocation of trade union funds, the government has no regulations on late payment fees. Thus, some who initially paid out of fear of government decrees, later saw that other factories were not paying, and they also followed suit. There are also some cunning capitalists who deduct trade union funds from workers' wages; or add trade union funds to the cost. For example, Shanghai Yapur Bulb Factory only paid November's trade union funds in June, but wrote on the cost sheet sent to the Industrial Department, "One hundred bulbs, with an additional 800 yuan for trade union funds." The most serious situation is the formation of class antagonism. The Henan Printing Industry Guild actually discussed and unanimously refused to allocate trade union funds. The occurrence of the above phenomena is all due to the capitalist starting from the "one-sided view of profit," which does not conform to the spirit of "benefiting both labor and capital." In the future, how to make private enterprises allocate trade union funds in accordance with the regulations requires great efforts from all parties, and trade union organizations must constantly carry out struggles. The government must conduct regular inspections and strict supervision.
  II. The View of Administrative Aspects of State-Owned Enterprises That We Are All One Family
　　Many administrative aspects of state-owned enterprises believe that enterprises and trade unions are all one family, and both serve the interests of the working class, so there is no need to distinguish between each other. Therefore, they often refuse to allocate trade union funds. The manager of the Kaifeng Public Tobacco Factory said, "It's okay to use the trade union funds in this factory, even if I take 5 percent, but I will not hand it over to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions." An administrative cadre in charge of a state-owned factory in Wuhan said, "The trade union funds must be limited, no more than 100,000 at most, and must be approved by the administration when used." The Guangzhou Branch of the China Grease Company handed the trade union funds over to the personnel department for safekeeping, refusing to allocate them to the trade union. Some administrative cadres in charge also said, "Leave it with me, come and get it when you need it!" The State-owned Jianghuai Water and Land Transportation Corporation not only did not pay the cultural and educational funds, but also proposed that the trade union's cultural and educational work be handled by the administration. These administrative cadres in charge do not know that although the political positions of the trade union and the administration are basically the same, their positions are different in the division of labor. In order to do a good job in production tasks, the administrative aspect must establish a clear view of relying on the working class; to rely on the working class, it is necessary to effectively promote the development of trade union organizations to accelerate the improvement of the working masses' class consciousness and cultural level. This series of work requires trade union organizations to have sufficient funds to carry out and complete smoothly.
  III. The Lack of Legal Compliance by Government Agencies and State-Owned Enterprises
　　In the administrative aspects of government agencies and state-owned enterprises, when it comes to issues related to funding, they often first consider the country's financial and economic difficulties. This is of course very good. It's just that they sometimes forget the legal view that the people's laws must be observed, so they can easily overlook Article 24 of the Trade Union Law and not study it carefully. For example, the East China Education Department ordered the Sunan Cultural and Education Department to stop allocating trade union funds, saying, "This type of funding will be uniformly allocated by the central government, and will be stopped in the future." They are executing the fourth clause of Article 24, the subsidy fees of the people's governments at all levels, as the second clause, 2% of the actual total wage. The South China Finance and Economics Committee replied to public factories, "The 2% of trade union funds is deducted from the workers' salaries." When the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions negotiated with them, they only approved "Please request instructions for handling" and then there was no follow-up. In general, the relevant labor administration departments have not promptly studied and dealt with illegal events. Some administrative aspects of state-owned enterprises give as little as possible, and even emphasize that there are no instructions from the superiors, or say "Unable to reimburse without the approval of the superiors," and refuse to implement this provision. These erroneous views must be overcome.
　　Since the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, in addition to the above reasons, the following three problems still exist in the work of trade union funds:
  I. The Issue of the Date of Commencement of Trade Union Funding Allocation
　　The Trade Union Law was promulgated and implemented on June 29, 1950. Since there are no provisions for late payment fees for the allocation of trade union funds, and the relevant government departments have not strictly supervised the implementation, and the trade union organizations have not actively grasped the promotion, most private enterprises have been delayed, or waited and watched state-owned enterprises. State-owned enterprises have a certain financial reimbursement system. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the allocation of trade union funds, the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government jointly issued a notice on October 11, 1950, stipulating that public factories, mines, shops, farms, and administrative agencies and schools should all start implementation from August. Local people's governments have also issued temporary measures for the collection and payment of trade union funds formulated by local trade unions. However, the date of commencement of allocation is not very consistent. The East China region generally started from July in accordance with the Trade Union Law, while North China and Central South mostly started from August, and some, such as Tianjin, started from September. The inconsistency in the allocation of trade union funds affects the income of trade union funds and the establishment of the system. Therefore, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has formulated temporary measures for the administrative or capitalist aspects of enterprises, agencies, and schools to allocate and collect trade union funds, and submitted them to the Financial and Economic Committee for promulgation. The decision to increase the collection of 1% of the late payment fee per day will be implemented with the promulgation of the measures. The administrative or capitalist aspects of enterprises, agencies, schools, and other production units or administrative units that established grassroots trade union organizations before August 1950 and have not yet allocated trade union funds should pay supplementary payments from August 1950; enterprises that have not yet established grassroots trade union organizations but whose location has established local trade unions or industrial trade union organizations should start implementation from April 1951. Regarding the issue of the date of commencement of trade union funding allocation, there is now a standard to follow, which can be resolved.
  II. The Issue of Actual Total Wage
　　At present, China's wage system does not have a unified standard. Some are based on time, some are based on piecework, and some are based on commission and dividends; the form of wage payment is also extremely inconsistent. Some have very little monetary wage, and take the form of food allowance, housing, water and electricity, uniforms, and other subsidies; the form of welfare also sometimes conceals the essence of wages. When trade union funds are to be calculated at 2% of the actual total wage, many difficulties are encountered. Some do not include the basic wage, such as some enterprises in Heilongjiang Province do not calculate piecework wages. Some do not include the auxiliary wage, such as many enterprises in Shanghai only allocate according to the nominal wage, excluding meal fees, technology, uniform and other allowances. Some also come up with ideas from the workers' names, such as some enterprises in Tangshan only calculate the wages of long-term workers and not the wages of temporary workers, and a public cooperative sack factory in Kaifeng only calculates the wages of trade union members and not the wages of non-members, only calculates the wages of internal workers and not the wages of external workers. On March 7, 1951, the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council issued the "Regulations on the Composition of Total Wages," and the issue of how to calculate the actual total wage will be uniformly resolved in the future. As for cooperative enterprises and private hospitals with social welfare nature, whether or not to allocate trade union funds can be decided by whether their wages belong to employees on the payroll. Trade union funds must be allocated according to the actual total wage. Therefore, if the relationship between rickshaw pullers and rickshaw companies is only a lease relationship rather than a labor-capital relationship, then rickshaw companies that only rent out vehicles do not need to allocate trade union funds. The "Regulations on the Composition of Total Wages" also clearly points out at the end: "If individual enterprises have difficulties in implementing certain items in these regulations, they must report to the local labor administrative agency for handling." This regulation can solve the issue of total wages.
  III. The Issue of Establishing a Trade Union Funds Revenue and Expenditure System
　　At present, workers in major industrial sectors and major and medium-sized cities across the country have basically been organized. National industrial trade unions have also been established one after another. Preliminary conditions for establishing a unified expenditure system for national trade union funds are already in place. However, due to the uneven development of organizational work, some industrial trade unions are centralized, some are decentralized, and the distribution is different. In addition, some trade union cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the political significance of doing a good job in trade union financial work, and do not attach enough importance to it. Therefore, the problems that exist today are:
　　(1) Most industrial trade unions have not established their own budget, final accounts, accounting, auditing, and other systems. The organization department responsible for collecting membership dues is not in contact with the financial department responsible for safekeeping and use. The income accounts are neither clear, nor is there a fixed proportion for payment. Some put the membership dues on each committee member. After the city of Tianjin cleared its finances, there were 84 cases of corruption, with a total loss of more than 18 million yuan. The welfare director of the Huangpu Wharf Branch in Shanghai fled with 8 million yuan of rice allocation money paid by members. These serious phenomena are all due to the failure to establish a funding system and the failure to regularly publish accounts to members, and must be quickly overcome and corrected.
　　(2) Some industrial trade unions have large amounts of funds, but do not know how to use them. Some have not used all of the cultural and educational funds for the cultural and educational undertakings of employees, but have used them for production and running factories. Some have also deposited membership dues in banks to generate interest. As a result, there has been a phenomenon in some places that employees are unwilling to pay membership dues. For example, a member of the Shanghai Clothing Industry Trade Union said, "We only see them collecting membership dues, and they don't provide welfare after collecting it, so we drag our feet." This seriously affects the discipline and organization of the trade union organization.
　　Under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, trade union organizations in various places seriously establish their own budget, final accounts, accounting, auditing and other systems in accordance with the various decisions of the National Trade Union Financial Conference, which is the primary link in doing a good job in trade union undertakings.

　　工会经费的问题
    董锄平
    工会经费，是巩固与发展工会组织的最重要的物质基础，是有关工会建设的一个基本环节。中央人民政府在中华人民共和国工会法中列为专章，就是要在物质方面，给工会组织以法律的支持与保障。一年来，行政方面或资方拨交工会经费的一般情况是：老解放区较新解放区好，大城市较中小城市好，国营企业较私营企业好，工业较商业好，大型工商业较中小型的好。在工会财务制度方面，由于中华全国总工会的正确领导，召开了全国工会财务会议，拟订了各种经费收支办法，开始逐渐地实施经费统一管理并建立工会财务制度。但是，从整个工会法执行情况来看，工会经费问题中也还相当普遍地存在着一些混乱现象和若干实际困难。
  一、资方的一利观点
    许多资本家对“发展生产，劳资两利”的政策，仍了解不够透彻，不懂得发展生产必须依靠工人阶级，也就不了解按照工会法的规定缴纳工会经费，不但是他们应当遵守的义务，而且是对他们有益的事情。南京帽业有些资方说：“工会剥削我们！”上海永生热水瓶厂资方说：“我饭已给他们吃了，还要缴费？”有的甚至挑拨工会干部说：“我缴给银行，你们还要填表向产业工会申请，多麻烦；倒不如直接向我要，要多少就是多少。”大多数资本家都是用软拖硬赖的方法，拒不拨交工会经费。很多人认为“营业税都可以拖，工会经费拖一拖，没啥关系。”上海协昌缝纫机器厂资方满口“就要缴，就要缴”，但却总是不缴。五星公司绸缎部资方则是硬赖，他说：“我做老板不犯法，如不缴文教费要吃官司，那末，我坐监牢好了”。有些人是彼此推诿，南京钢铁机器业有些资方说：“叫我带头拿，我不干。”武汉永龙米厂资方说：“武汉资方都给，我就给。”关于工会经费的拨交，政府没有滞纳金的规定，于是，一些开始慑于政府法令而缴纳的，后来见别厂不缴，就也跟着不缴了。还有一些狡猾的资本家从工人工资中扣出工会经费；或者把工会经费加到成本费上。如上海亚浦尔灯泡厂十一月份才缴六月份的工会经费，却在造送工业部的成本单上写着“百支灯泡，附加工会经费八百元。”情况最严重的是形成阶级的对抗。河南印刷业同业公会居然讨论一致拒绝拨交工会经费。上述现象的发生，都是由于资方从“一利观点”出发，而不合乎“劳资两利”的精神。今后如何使私营企业按章拨交工会经费尚须各方作很大的努力，工会组织尤须不断地进行斗争。政府须作经常的检查和严格的监督。
  二、国营企业行政方面一家人不分彼此的观点
    许多国营企业的行政方面，以为企业和工会都是一家人，都是为了工人阶级的利益服务，不必分什么彼此。因此，也常常拒绝拨交工会经费。开封公营烟厂经理说：“工会经费在本厂用，叫我拿百分之五都行，如拿到总工会，我是不交的。”武汉一公营厂行政负责干部说：“工会经费要有限制，最多不超过十万，用时须经行政批准。”中国油脂公司广州分公司将工会经费交给人事科保管，不肯拨交工会。也有的行政负责干部说：“放在我这里，要就来拿吧！”国营江淮水陆运输总公司，不但不交文教经费，而且还提出把工会文教工作交给行政去办。这些行政负责干部不知道工会与行政在政治上的立场，虽然基本上一致，但在工作的分工上，彼此的岗位都有不同。行政方面，为了搞好生产任务，必须建立明确的依靠工人阶级的观点；要依靠工人阶级，就必须有效地推进工会组织的发展，以加速提高工人群众的阶级觉悟和文化水平。这一系列的工作，就要工会组织有充裕的经费，才能顺利地进行和完成。
  三、政府机关和国营企业缺乏守法观点
    在政府机关和国营企业的行政方面，一提到有关经费的问题，往往首先考虑到国家财政经济困难。这当然是很好的。只是他们有时却忘记了人民的法律必须遵守的这一法制观点，因此对于工会法第二十四条的规定，就很容易忽略过去而不细心研究。例如华东教育部下令苏南文教处停拨工会经费，谓“此类经费，将由中央统一拨付，以后停止供给。”他们是把二十四条四款各级人民政府的补助费当作二款实际工资总额的百分之二的工会经费来执行了。华南财政经济委员会答复公营工厂说：“百分之二的工会经费是由工人工薪中扣除”，当广东省总工会和他们交涉时，又只批了个“请示办理”，便没有下文。一般劳动行政有关部门，对于违法的事件，也大都未及时研究处理。有些国营企业行政方面是能少给一点就少给一点，更有的强调上级没有指示，或说“没有经过上级批准，无法报销。”而拒不执行此一规定。这些错误观点是必须克服的。
    工会法颁布以来，在工会经费工作中，所受到的阻碍，除上述几点原因外，尚存在着下列三个问题：
  一、开始拨交工会经费的日期问题
    工会法是一九五○年六月二十九日公布施行的。由于工会经费的拨交没有滞纳金的规定，而政府有关部门又未严格的监督执行，工会组织也未主动的掌握推动，因此，大部分私营企业就拖延下来，或者观望国营企业。国营企业是有一定的财政报销制度的。为了使工会经费的拨交，能顺利进行，中央人民政府劳动部与财政部在一九五○年十月十一日联合发出通知，规定公营工厂矿场商店农场以及各行政机关学校一律自八月份起开始执行。各地人民政府也都纷纷发布当地工会所制定的工会经费收缴暂行办法。但开始拨交的日期是不大一致的。华东区大都按照工会法自七月开始，华北、中南则多自八月开始，也有的如天津是自九月份起执行的。拨交工会经费不统一，工会经费的收入与制度的建立就受到影响。因此，中华全国总工会制定了关于企业机关学校的行政方面或资方拨交工会经费收缴暂行办法，送请财政经济委员会颁布。按日增缴百分之一的滞纳金的决定，将随该办法的公布而实行。各企业机关学校等生产单位或行政单位的行政方面或资方在一九五○年八月以前已建立工会基层组织，尚未拨交工会经费的应自一九五○年八月起补缴；尚未建立工会基层组织的企业而其所在地已建立地方工会或产业工会组织的应自一九五一年四月份起开始执行。关于开始拨交工会经费的日期问题，今后已有准绳可循，自可获得解决。
  二、实际工资总额问题
    目前中国工资制度，尚无统一标准，有的计时，有的计件，还有提成分红；而工资支付的形式，也极不一致。有的货币工资很少，采取包饭，给房子住，给水电，制服等津贴；福利的形式，有时也隐蔽了工资的实质。当工会经费要按实际工资总额百分之二来计算时，就碰到了许多困难。有的不把基本工资计算在内，如黑龙江省某些企业不计算计件工资。有的把辅助工资不计算在内，如上海许多企业只按名义工资拨交，不包括膳费、技术、制服等津贴在内。也有的从工人的名义上打主意，如唐山有些企业只计算长工工资而不算临时工工资，开封一公营合作社麻袋厂只算工会会员工资而不算非会员的，只算内工而不算外工的。一九五一年三月七日政务院财政经济委员会发布了《关于工资总额组成的规定》，今后实际工资总额如何计算的问题将可获得统一解决。至于合作社企业，带有社会福利性质的私营医院，要不要拨交工会经费，只要看他的工资，是不是属于在册人员就可决定。必须按实际工资总额来拨交工会经费。因此，三轮车夫和车行主若只是租赁关系而不是劳资关系，那末，仅出租车辆的车行主也可不必拨交工会经费了。《关于工资总额组成的规定》最后还明确的指出：“如有个别企业对于本规定某些项目，确难执行时，得报请当地劳动行政机关处理之。”这一规定，是可以解决工资总额的问题的。
  三、建立工会经费收支制度的问题
    目前全国各重要产业部门，各大中城市的工人，已基本上组织起来。全国产业工会亦已次第建立。建立全国工会经费统一开支制度的初步条件已经具备。但由于组织工作发展的不平衡，产业工会有的集中，有的分散，分布情况不同，再加上有些工会干部对搞好工会财务工作的政治意义认识不足，重视不够，所以今天存在的问题是：
    （一）大部分产业工会都没有建立自己的预算、决算、会计、审核等制度。负责收会费的组织部门与负责保管使用的财务部门，互不联系。收入的账目既不清楚，支付也无一定比例。有的把会费收了放在每个委员身上。天津全市清理财务后，有八十四起贪污事件，共损失一千八百多万元。上海黄浦码头分会福利科长把会员交的配米款八百万卷逃。这些严重的现象，都是由于没有建立经费制度，没有定期向会员公布账目所致，必须迅速克服纠正。
    （二）某些产业工会有了大笔经费，不知道如何使用。有的没有把文教经费全部用在职工的文化教育事业上，而拿去搞生产，开办工厂。也有的把会费存到银行里去生息。因而有些地方就发生了职工不愿交付会费的现象。如上海衣着业工会会员说：“只看见收会费，收了去又不办福利，我们就拖拖他。”这就严重的影响了工会组织的纪律性和组织性。
    各地工会组织在中华全国总工会领导下，认真的按照全国工会财务会议的各项决定，建立起自己的预算、决算、会计、审核等制度，是做好工会事业的首要环节。
