Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: According to a United Press report: The Japan Peace Protection Committee held its second national representative conference in Tokyo on March 27th and 28th. Approximately 50 representatives from all over the country attended. The conference listened to a general report by Heino Yoshitaro, Director of the China Research Institute and member of the World Peace Council, and discussed detailed proposals regarding the new movement policy put forward by the headquarters of the Japan Peace Protection Committee. The proposals included: issuing a declaration to the world demanding a peaceful resolution to the Japanese issue; launching a signature campaign demanding the conclusion of a peace covenant by the five major powers; assisting the "Overall Peace Patriotic Movement Council" in strengthening the signature campaign demanding overall peace and opposing rearmament; supporting the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress and the World Peace Council, and carrying out activities to put them into practice in Japan.

The conference passed a resolution to launch a signature campaign in Japan demanding overall peace; called on the Japanese people to sign the declaration demanding the conclusion of a peace covenant by the five major powers; demanded that the United Nations rescind the illegal resolution slandering China as an "aggressor"; and issued a declaration to peace-loving people in Asia and the Pacific countries.

The conference also decided to broadly support candidates who are fighting for peace in the local elections.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: According to United Press news: The Japanese Yoshida government and the Tokyo police authorities have decided to prohibit the Japanese people from using Tokyo's "People's Plaza" (i.e., the plaza in front of the Imperial Palace; after the war, the Japanese working people have gathered here every year to celebrate "May Day") on "May Day." All Japanese labor unions have expressed opposition to this decision by the reactionary authorities. The executive committee of the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Labor Unions passed a resolution on March 30th to resolutely fight against the unreasonable decision of the authorities, and called on all labor unions to launch a protest movement for this purpose. The resolution pointed out: This issue is not simply a matter of using a place, but a suppressive measure against the workers' movement and an intolerable fascist act.

Leaders of the Japan Federation of Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Unions and the Japan Teachers' Union also issued statements opposing the Yoshida government's decision. The right-wing General Council of Trade Unions of Japan also expressed dissatisfaction, believing that the Yoshida government's decision is equivalent to prohibiting the celebration of "May Day," which is intolerable.

    【新华社十八日讯】据联合通讯社讯：日本拥护和平委员会于三月二十七、二十八两日在东京举行第二次全国代表会议，出席的有全国各地代表约五十人。大会听取了世界和平理事会理事、中国研究所所长平野义太郎的一般报告，并讨论了日本拥护和平委员会总部所提出的关于新运动方针的详细提案。提案包括：向世界发表宣言，要求以和平方式解决日本问题；展开要求五大国缔结和平公约的签名运动，协助“全面媾和爱国运动协议会”加强要求全面媾和与反对重新武装的签名运动；支持第二届世界和平大会与世界和平理事会的决议，并进行在日本付诸实践的活动。
    大会通过决议，在日本展开要求全面媾和的签名运动；号召日本人民在要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签名；要求联合国取消诬蔑中国为“侵略者”的非法决议；向亚洲、太平洋各国爱好和平的人民发表宣言。
    大会并决定在地方选举中广泛地支持为和平而斗争的候选人。
    【新华社十八日讯】据联合通讯社消息：日本吉田政府与东京警察当局已决定禁止日本人民在“五一”节使用东京“人民广场”（按即皇宫前广场，战后日本劳动人民每年均在此集会庆祝“五一”节）。日本各工会对反动当局的这项决定，一致表示反对。全日本产业别工会会议执行委员会于三月三十日通过决议，要为反对当局的无理决定而坚决斗争，并号召各工会为此展开抗议运动。决议指出：这一问题并非单纯是使用地方的问题，而是对工人运动的镇压措施，是难以容忍的法西斯行动。
    日本自治团体工会联合会及日本教职员工会的负责人，也都发表谈话，反对吉田政府的决定。右翼的日本工会总评议会也表示不满，该会认为吉田政府的决定等于是禁止庆祝“五一”节的行为，令人难以容忍。
