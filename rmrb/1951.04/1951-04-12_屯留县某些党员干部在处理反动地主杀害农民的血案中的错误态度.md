The Erroneous Attitude of Certain Party Cadres in Tunliu County in Handling the Bloody Case of Reactionary Landlords Killing Peasants
Xiao Han, Wang Peifa, Zhao Zuowei

Recently, Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, uncovered a shocking incident in which reactionary landlord Cui Chengzhuang murdered Li Fuchang's family of four. This fully exposed the reactionary nature of the landlord class and also revealed the extremely paralyzing thoughts of some leading cadres in Tunliu County who turned a blind eye to the counterattack of the landlord class.

The course of events was as follows: During the land reform in 1946, Li Fuchang, a peasant in Miaoqiao Village, Tunliu, was allocated five mu of land and a house belonging to the landlord Cui Chengzhuang. From then on, Li Fuchang was regarded as a thorn in Cui Chengzhuang's side, who harbored resentment. Landlord Cui Chengzhuang often quarreled with Li Fuchang by using the children's quarrels as an excuse, and said repeatedly: "Li Fuchang is really hateful, planting our land and living in our house, and still being stingy with us." Last year, on the nights of the twelfth and thirteenth of the seventh lunar month, landlord Cui Chengzhuang and his wife and son Cui Jinxi discussed poisoning Li Fuchang's entire family during the Mid-Autumn Festival. When the Cui family decided on the poisoning plan, Cui Chengzhuang said: "He divided our house and land. I will never be content until his whole family is wiped out." At first, his son Cui Jinxi was a little timid, but Cui Chengzhuang said: "Don't be afraid. The two of us old folks will take responsibility for poisoning his whole family." So Cui Jinxi took half a package of arsenic (about one and a half taels) from the beam and gave it to his mother, taking the opportunity to poison Li Fuchang's entire family. When Cui Chengzhuang's wife saw Fuchang's wife washing wheat and preparing to grind it into flour for the "Fifteenth," she put the arsenic in the millstone. On the fourteenth day of the seventh lunar month (August 27), Fuchang's wife steamed the ground flour into steamed buns, preparing to eat them on the morning of the fifteenth. She first steamed the bran into cornbread for the whole family to eat that day. Soon after eating, the poison took effect, and all four members of Li Fuchang's family felt nauseous, vomited yellow water, and had stomach pains. Li Fuchang suspected poisoning and asked his sick wife to invite the village chief, Yang Renhe, to tell him, but the village chief Yang Renhe indifferently said, "No, no!" He also found a doctor who said it was "cholera plague." So, on the one hand, they treated it as a plague, and on the other hand, they continued to eat the poisoned flour. By the twentieth of the seventh lunar month, the two young children had died first, and Fuchang and his wife were also on their last breath. Cui Chengzhuang and his son then spread rumors saying: "This is because Fuchang disturbed the 'Dragon Mountain' and 'Earth Sha' (referring to ghosts and gods) when digging a kiln in the wild." At the time, some peasants were deceived by Cui Chengzhuang and did not dare to visit them. The village chief Yang Renhe then asked Cui Jinxi to take care of them. Cui Jinxi took the opportunity to make the last batch of poisoned white flour into soup for Li Fuchang and his wife to drink, thus deepening the poisoning and making it impossible to save them. On the first day of the eighth lunar month (September 12), Li Fuchang and his wife died together.

At that time, the Miaoqiao Village Branch of the Communist Party of China had two diametrically opposed attitudes towards this matter: Branch Committee members Zhang Qingkui, Branch Propaganda Committee member Junma, and Branch Secretary Li Shuangsuo, etc., based on all aspects of the evidence and the situation of class struggle, judged that this was a counterattack by landlord Cui Chengzhuang, poisoning the emancipated peasants. They promptly reported to the Fifth District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Tunliu County and actively handled the aftermath of Li Fuchang's family. In addition, they waged a struggle against the behavior of village chief Yang Renhe and public security officer Zheng Caifa, who lost their revolutionary stand and violated Party discipline. However, village chief Yang Renhe and public security officer Zheng Caifa (both of whom were branch committee members) repeatedly defended the landlord. They said, "Cui Jinxi is a good boy and would not do such a thing." Before this incident, village chief Yang Renhe always sided with the landlord when dealing with disputes between peasants and landlords. On the ninth day of the sixth lunar month last year, Fuchang's daughter and Cui Jinxi's child had a quarrel. Cui Jinxi's daughter-in-law, Fan Xinhui, took the opportunity to quarrel with Fuchang's wife, deliberately jumped off the cliff of Fuchang's house, sprained her ankle, and sued to the village government. Village chief Yang Renhe did not ask right from wrong, but asked people to carry Fan Xinhui to Li Fuchang's house to be taken care of by Fuchang's wife; food, drink, and medicine expenses were also borne by Li Fuchang. Li Fuchang's wife was not convinced by this treatment. Village chief Yang Renhe then tied up Li Fuchang's wife and hung her on a pear tree. Thus, Li Fuchang's wife was forced to agree. That day, Fan Xinhui's family also invited a group of people to eat and drink lavishly at Li Fuchang's house, consuming a total of fifty jin of white flour and five packs of cigarettes. Fan Xinhui was recuperating at Fuchang's house, consuming a total of two dan and seven dou of millet from Li Fuchang. After criticism from the branch, village chief Yang Renhe publicly apologized to Li Fuchang; and ordered landlord Cui Chengzhuang to compensate for all the grain consumed by Fan Xinhui during her recuperation. In addition, village chief Yang Renhe and public security officer Zheng Caifa also condoned landlord Cui Jinxi's joining the militia as a squad leader. After Li Fuchang's entire family was poisoned, landlord Cui Jinxi said to Zheng Caifa: "If things go wrong, it will be because of Zhang Qingkui, Junma, and Li Shuangsuo, but you and the village chief don't have to be afraid." He also said: "District cadres often come to our village, I'm afraid something will happen, I'm preparing to run away." Public security officer Zheng Caifa did not report such words to the Party. This is because Yang Renhe had been deceived and bought off by the landlord with small favors, losing his class stand. On the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month last year, after Cui Chengzhuang killed Li Fuchang's entire family, he invited village chief Yang Renhe to a meal at noon. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, he also sent moon cakes and grapes to Village Chief Yang. Cui Chengzhuang and his son deliberately expressed some fear about this matter, but Yang Renhe comforted them and said, "Produce well, don't be afraid!"

The paralysis of thought of some district cadres in the Fifth District was also very serious. When Li Fuchang's entire family was poisoned but not dead, Zhang Guangyu, the deputy district chief of the district, was working in the village. At that time, he only listened to others saying it was a plague and did not inquire further. After District Party Secretary Dong Chenglin and Zhao Guoyou, a doctor from the district joint supply and marketing cooperative, performed an autopsy, the doctor said it was poisoning, but Dong Chenglin said, "I don't dare to say anything rashly." Doctor Zhao Guoyou then changed his words and said it was cholera plague. Dong Chenglin did not analyze the problem based on the actual situation, but only said vaguely: "Both possibilities of plague and poisoning exist." At this time, Cui Jinxi also wooed the district cadres, inviting Deputy District Chief Zhang Guangyu and a district committee member surnamed Zhang to dinner twice. Later, when the district reported the case to the county, the district only forwarded the information up and down, taking an irresponsible attitude. Moreover, the deputy district chief was afraid of poisoning, so he passively hid in Xiaozhaigou.

After receiving the report from the Fifth District Committee, the Tunliu County Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately suggested that the County People's Government send Yao Shifan, a staff member of the Education Section, to conduct an in-depth investigation. After the investigation, Yao reflected to the county the historical situation and many circumstantial evidence related to the incident. Shen Luming, deputy secretary of the Tunliu County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Jia Junying, deputy director of the Public Security Bureau, Li Junjie, the hospital director, and others held a meeting to study and analyze the situation based on the information reflected by Yao. They unanimously affirmed that it was poisoning. Shen Luming also pointed out: This is a landlord counterattack against the peasants. He suggested that the People's Government should immediately arrest the criminals. At that time, Liu Guhan, the secretary of the Public Security Bureau, said: There is no definite evidence yet, and it is not appropriate to arrest people. At the meeting, it was decided to send a capable cadre at the section chief level to investigate. However, the Public Security Bureau did not implement the decision of the meeting. Jia Junying shirked responsibility for not being able to send anyone, but only asked Cui Junsheng, a public security team member who was in the Fifth District, to investigate. Later, after Shen Luming repeatedly urged, the Public Security Bureau sent Liang Jinyu to investigate. Liang Jinyu stayed there for eight days (and went elsewhere for three days during the eight days), and did not discover the truth of the problem. After that, no one handled the matter for more than a month. It was not until Wang Taikui, the secretary of the County Committee, returned from Changzhi and discussed it separately with Li Yongfu, the county magistrate, Jia Junying, the deputy director of the Public Security Bureau, and others, that he convened a meeting of the County Committee to re-discuss the matter, and again decided that the Public Security Bureau and the Judicial Section should be responsible for the investigation. But it dragged on for another period of time. According to Huang Zhaofang of the Public Security Bureau, Director Jia originally wanted to go in person, but could not go because of the rain. Gao Dingzhen, the section chief of the Judicial Section, believed that there were many important cases that needed to be handled and was too busy to go. County Magistrate Li Yongfu did not insist on implementing the decision, nor did he report the situation to the County Committee. It was not until County Party Secretary Wang Taikui discovered this that he convened a second meeting of the County Committee to discuss it and criticized Jia Junying and others. On December 3, the Tunliu People's Government arrested the criminals Cui Chengzhuang and his wife and son Cui Jinxi.

Judging from the handling of this case, the thinking of some leading comrades of the Tunliu County Committee was relatively clear (they pointed out the nature of the problem at the beginning, made specific arrangements, and conducted inspections), but they did not promptly criticize and correct the phenomena of ideological paralysis, procrastination, and failure to implement decisions on the part of Jia Junying, deputy director of the Public Security Bureau, and Gao Dingzhen, section chief of the Judicial Section, which caused the case to drag on for nearly five months. At the same time, the County Committee did not promptly report to the higher authorities, nor did it instruct the District Committee to use this to educate Party members, overcome and clarify the paralysis of thought of Party members, and carry out necessary organizational rectification. After inspection, the County Committee made a special report and organized the entire Party to inspect the implementation of the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and prepared to mourn Li Fuchang's entire family.

County Magistrate Li Yongfu (member of the County Committee) only casually mentioned the serious case of landlord counterattack causing deaths a few times to Gao Dingzhen, the section chief of the Judicial Section, and did not carry out the decisions of the County Committee, nor did he pay enough attention to the instructions of the Changzhi Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Shanxi Provincial Committee. Therefore, this major case was repeatedly delayed. County Magistrate Li Yongfu should bear the main responsibility. Jia Junying, deputy director of the Public Security Bureau, adopted a negative attitude towards this matter and repeatedly delayed it, showing irresponsibility to the people. Gao Dingzhen, the section chief of the Judicial Section, mistakenly believed that since no one had appealed and no plaintiff was pursuing the matter, he shirked responsibility and delayed handling it.

The Changzhi Prefectural Committee's Discipline Inspection Committee recently sent a special inspection team to inspect the illegal and derelict behavior of cadres and Party members in Tunliu County in this incident in order to impose disciplinary sanctions.

　　屯留县某些党员干部在处理反动地主杀害农民的血案中的错误态度
    萧寒、王培法、赵作为
    山西屯留县最近发现了一件反动地主崔成庄杀害农民李福昌全家四口的惊人事件。这充分地暴露了地主阶级的反动本质，同时也暴露了屯留县若干领导干部对地主阶级反攻熟视无睹的极端麻痹思想。
    事情的经过是这样的：一九四六年土地改革中，屯留苗翘村农民李福昌分到地主崔成庄的土地五亩、房子一座，从此李福昌即被地主崔成庄看作眼中钉，怀恨在心。地主崔成庄时常借两家孩子吵架而和李福昌吵架，并口口声声说：“李福昌真可恶，种了咱的地，住了咱的房，还要刻薄咱。”去年旧历七月十二、十三两夜，地主崔成庄夫妇和他儿子崔进喜商议，趁过七月十五节时，将李福昌全家毒死。在崔家定毒计时，崔成庄说：“他分了咱家的房和地，不除灭了他这一家，咱总不甘心。”起初他儿子崔进喜有些胆怯，崔成庄说：“不要怕，毒死他全家由我老俩口顶命。”于是崔进喜便从梁上取下半包砒霜（约有一两半），交给他母亲，乘机给李福昌全家下毒。崔成庄老婆看见福昌老婆淘出麦子，准备磨面过“十五”，她便将砒霜放在磨眼里面。旧历七月十四日（八月二十七日），福昌老婆将磨好的面蒸成了馍馍，准备十五日上午吃。她先将麸子蒸成窝窝头当天全家吃了一顿。吃下不久，毒性即发，李福昌全家四口人全都恶心，吐黄水，肚子疼。李福昌已怀疑是中毒，便叫带病的老婆把村长杨仁合请来告诉他，但村长杨仁合满不在意地说：“不会！不会！”又找来个医生也说是“霍乱瘟疫”。所以一面是按瘟疫治疗，一面继续吃着毒面。到七月二十日，两个小孩子先死去，福昌夫妇也奄奄一息。崔成庄父子即制造谣言说：“这是福昌在野地打窑动了‘龙山’、‘土煞’（指鬼神）了。”当时有些农民被崔成庄蒙蔽，也就不敢前去探望。村长杨仁合便叫崔进喜去照料。崔进喜乘机将最后一把带毒的白面，作成拌汤让李福昌夫妇喝了；因此中毒愈深，无法挽救。旧历八月初一日（九月十二日），李福昌夫妇一起死去。
    当时中共苗翘村支部委员会，对此事有两种截然不同的态度：支部委员张庆奎、支部宣传委员骏马、支部书记李双锁等，他们根据各方面的证据和阶级斗争的情况，判断这是地主崔成庄反攻，毒杀翻身农民。他们及时地向中共屯留县五区委员会报告，并积极处理李福昌全家善后事情。此外他们对村长杨仁合、公安员郑财发丧失革命立场与破坏党纪的行为，进行了斗争。而村长杨仁合，公安员郑财发（都是支部委员），却一再为地主辩护。他们说：“崔进喜是个好孩子，不会作出这样的事情。”在这事件前，村长杨仁合在处理农民和地主的纠纷中，总是偏袒地主。去年旧历六月初九日，福昌的女儿和崔进喜的孩子吵架。崔进喜媳妇范新惠趁此与福昌老婆吵架，故意从福昌家的崖垴上跳下来，扭伤腿腕，告到村政府。村长杨仁合不问是非，就叫人把范新惠抬到李福昌家，由福昌老婆伺候；吃喝药费，亦由李福昌负担。李福昌老婆不服这种处理。村长杨仁合便把李福昌老婆捆起来，吊在梨树上。这样李福昌老婆被逼答应了。当天范新惠娘家又约了一伙人，到李福昌家大吃大喝一顿，共吃去了五十斤白面，抽了五条纸烟。范新惠在福昌家养伤，前后共耗费了李福昌两石七斗小米。后经支部批评，村长杨仁合才公开向李福昌道了歉；并命令地主崔成庄将范新惠养伤所耗费的粮食全部包赔。此外村长杨仁合和公安员郑财发还纵容地主崔进喜混入民兵当班长。农民李福昌全家被毒杀后，地主崔进喜曾和郑财发说：“事情要坏就坏在张庆奎、骏马、李双锁等人身上，你和村长不怕。”又说：“区干部常到咱们村，恐怕要出事，我准备逃跑。”公安员郑财发听了这样的话，竟然不向党报告。这因为杨仁合已被地主小恩小惠所欺骗、收买，丧失了阶级立场。去年七月十五日，崔成庄杀害农民李福昌全家后，中午曾请村长杨仁合吃了一顿饭。中秋节又给杨村长送月饼、葡萄等。崔成庄父子故意表示对这件事情有些害怕，杨仁合却安慰他们说：“好好生产吧，不要害怕！”
    五区某些区干部麻痹思想也是十分严重。李福昌全家中毒未死时，该区副区长张广玉在该村工作。当时他只听别人说是瘟疫，便不再过问。区委书记董成林和区联合供销社医生赵国有验尸后，医生说是中毒，董成林却说：“不敢乱说。”医生赵国有便改了口，说是霍乱瘟疫。董成林不根据实际情况分析问题，只笼统地说：“瘟疫、中毒两种可能都有。”这时崔进喜又拉拢区干部，两次请副区长张广玉和一个姓张的区委委员吃饭。后来区里把这个案子呈报县里，区里只是上传下达，采取不负责的态度。而且副区长怕中毒，便消极的躲到小寨沟去了。
    中共屯留县县委接到五区区委会的报告后，即建议县人民政府派教育科科员姚士藩前往深入调查。姚调查后向县里反映了与此事件相关的历史情况及许多旁证。中共屯留县委副书记申鲁明、公安局副局长贾俊英、医院院长李俊杰等集会研究，根据姚反映的情况分析结果，一致肯定是中毒。申鲁明并指出：这是地主向农民反攻。他建议人民政府应立即逮捕凶犯。当时公安局秘书刘谷汉表示：尚无确证，不宜捕人。会上也就决定派股长一级的得力干部下去调查。但是公安局并未执行会议决定。贾俊英推托派不出人去，只是叫正在五区的一个公安队员崔俊生调查。后经申鲁明再三督促，公安局才派了梁金玉前往调查。梁金玉下去住了八天（八天中还到别处走了三天），没有发现问题的真相。此后一个多月没人去处理这件事情。直到县委书记王太奎从长治回来，分头与县长李永福、公安局副局长贾俊英等商谈后，即召集县委会议重新讨论此事，再次决定由公安局、司法科负责调查。但是又拖了一段时间。据公安局黄兆芳反映：本来贾局长要亲自去的，但因天雨不能去。司法科郜定镇科长认为有许多重要案件需处理，忙不过来，不能去。县长李永福也没有坚持执行决定。更没有向县委会汇报这一情况。直至县委书记王太奎发现后，又二次召开县委会会议讨论，并批评了贾俊英等。十二月三日屯留人民政府才将凶犯崔成庄夫妇及其儿子崔进喜一并逮捕。
    从处理这一案件看来，屯留县委会若干领导同志的思想是比较明确的（开始就指明问题的性质，具体布置并进行了检查），但是对公安局副局长贾俊英、司法科科长郜定镇思想麻痹、办事拖拖沓沓，不执行决定的现象，并未及时批评与纠正，以致这件案子拖了将近五个月时间。同时县委会也没有及时向上级报告，也没有指示区委，借此对党员进行教育，克服与澄清党员的麻痹思想，进行必要的组织整顿。经检查后，县委会才作了专门报告，并组织全党检查执行镇压反革命政策情形，和筹备追悼李福昌全家。
    县长李永福（县委委员）对这样重大的地主反攻人命案件，只轻描淡写地和司法科长郜定镇说了几次就算了事，对县委会的决定没有贯彻执行，对长治专署及山西省委的指示，没有引起足够重视。所以这个重大案件一再拖延，县长李永福应负主要责任，公安局副局长贾俊英对此事采取消极态度，一再拖延，表现了对人民不负责任。司法科长郜定镇错误地认为：这事既没人上诉，又无原告追究，即推诿缓办。
    长治地委纪律检查委员会，最近曾专门派出检查小组去检查屯留县干部党员在这一事件中的违法失职行为，以便给以纪律处分。
