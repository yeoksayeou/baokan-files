　　To the Editor:

　　Cotton has now been planted in Xiaojin Village, Second District, Jinsha County, Guizhou. The peasants, who won the victory in the struggle against local bullies, have a higher production enthusiasm than in previous years. The peasants also enthusiastically responded to the government's call to plant more cotton and tobacco. The whole village has now decided to plant 12 mu of cotton and 7 mu of tobacco on a trial basis.

　　To the Editor:

　　In order to expand cotton planting, Lixian County, Hunan, has established a cotton planting promotion committee, invited experienced cotton growers as teachers, and opened cotton planting training classes. Two hundred farmers have already been trained in the county. Now, twenty carpenters have been organized to manufacture a cotton seeder suitable for the needs of the farmers here. The Provincial Department of Agriculture has ordered more than 200 units, and the County Construction Section has ordered more than 50 units. Farmers from nearby areas have also come to buy this cotton seeder on their own initiative. After publicity, a craze for cotton planting has unfolded in our county.

　　贵州金沙县二区种上棉花  湖南澧县农民展开种棉热潮编辑同志：
    贵州金沙县二区小金村，现在已经开始春耕了。在反霸斗争中得到了胜利的农民，生产情绪比往年都高涨。农民们并热烈响应政府多种棉、烟的号召，全村现已决定试种棉十二亩，种烟七亩。
            赵献礼编辑同志：
    湖南澧县为了扩大植棉，成立了一个植棉推广委员会，约请了种棉有经验的人作教师，开办植棉训练班。已经有两百农民到县受了训练。现在又组织了二十个木匠，制造一种适合这里农民需用的棉花播种机。省农业厅订购了二百多部，县建设科订购了五十多部，附近各地农民也有自动来买此种播棉机的。经过宣传以后，我们县已展开了种棉的热潮。
