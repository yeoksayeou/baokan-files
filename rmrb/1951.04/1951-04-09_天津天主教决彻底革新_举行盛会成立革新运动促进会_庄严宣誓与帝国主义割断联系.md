　　Tianjin Catholicism Determined to Thoroughly Innovate
　  Grand Meeting Held to Establish Innovation Movement Promotion Association
　  Solemn Oath Taken to Sever Ties with Imperialism
    [Report from this newspaper] The Tianjin Catholic Innovation Movement Promotion Association held its inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM on the 7th. The convening of this conference is an unprecedented grand event for Tianjin Catholicism, fully demonstrating the determination of Tianjin Catholicism to sever ties with imperialism and thoroughly innovate. In addition to 218 Catholic representatives from the city, including Wu Kezhai, Zhang Yushi, and Nie Guoping, Zhao Zhenya, Deputy Bishop of the Tianjin Diocese, and all Chinese priests from various Catholic churches in the city, including Hui Ruyu, Li Depei, and Zhang Jizhong, also attended. Huang Songling, Director of the Municipal People's Government's Culture and Education Committee, and Li Huasheng, Deputy Director, also attended the meeting and delivered speeches. Father Liu Fudong from Beijing, Father Wang Ruji, and Catholic representatives Zhang Hanmin, Zhu Fuxiang, and Xie Sijun also came to Tianjin to participate in this conference.
    The conference summarized the work of the preparatory committee of the Innovation Promotion Association over the past three months, established the future work policy, and adopted the charter of the Tianjin Catholic Innovation Movement Promotion Association; it elected 23 members of the Innovation Promotion Association and 3 alternate members; and formally established the Tianjin Catholic Innovation Movement Promotion Association.
    The conference began after paying respects to Chairman Mao and singing the national anthem. Wu Kezhai, Zhao Zhenya, and 13 others were elected as the presidium. Chairman Wu Kezhai said in his opening speech: "This conference shows that Tianjin Catholics are determined to sever ties with imperialism and implement the Three-Self principles (self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation, the same below) based on the spirit of anti-imperialism, patriotism, and love of religion. In the past, imperialist elements have carried out despicable obstruction to our patriotic movement, engaging in rumors, sabotage, and division, causing many difficulties for the innovation movement. However, the fact that more than 15,000 Chinese priests and Catholics signed the innovation declaration proves that the conspiracy of the imperialist elements has completely failed." He pointed out that in the future, we must expose the crimes of imperialism using religion for aggression as much as possible, and resolutely oppose imperialist acts of abusing divine power and distorting religious doctrines. He also pointed out that the innovation movement is not xenophobic, but aims to ensure that the sovereignty of Catholicism is held in the hands of Chinese priests and is not controlled by imperialism. Finally, he thanked all the people of Tianjin and the People's Government for their support on behalf of the Innovation Promotion Association, and guaranteed that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, they would complete the great task of anti-imperialism, patriotism, and love of religion with practical actions.
    Huang Songling, Director of the Municipal People's Government's Culture and Education Committee, extended sincere congratulations to the conference on behalf of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government. In his speech, he pointed out that the development of the innovation movement of Tianjin Catholicism is due to three conditions: a broad mass base, leadership by key members, and the support and call of Chinese priests headed by Deputy Bishop Zhao Zhenya, and it has also gained the support of the Municipal People's Government, thus achieving great results. This movement will be promoted from Tianjin to North China and to the whole country, and will also have a significant impact on Catholicism worldwide. He also pointed out that difficulties may still be encountered in future work, so it is necessary to continue the struggle against imperialism, conduct ideological struggles within Catholics, and thoroughly eliminate the remaining imperialist influence. His speech was continuously met with warm applause from the audience.
    Nie Guoping, on behalf of the preparatory committee of the Innovation Promotion Association, reported to the conference on the work of the preparatory committee in the past three months. He said: "The innovation movement shocked the imperialist elements from the very beginning and was met with their frantic and despicable obstruction. However, through the efforts of the colleagues of the Promotion Association, the guidance of Chinese priests, and the cooperation of all Catholics, everyone gradually recognized the face of imperialism, and the number of signatures increased day by day, reaching today's achievements." Finally, on behalf of the Promotion Association, he put forward three requests to all Catholics: 1. Intensify study, improve political awareness, recognize the difference between religious doctrine and imperialism, no longer blindly follow, and no longer be used by imperialism. 2. Heighten vigilance and prevent imperialism from making a comeback. 3. Strengthen the unity between Chinese priests and Catholics, and strictly prevent imperialist elements from sowing discord.
    Deputy Bishop Zhao Zhenya said in his speech: For nearly a century, Catholicism has been consistently used by imperialism as a tool for aggression. He cited the Xikai Church case, the "Catholic Patriotic National Salvation Corps," American spies, and priests Shang Jianxun and Bu Xiangxian destroying our national sovereignty and other facts, saying: "Don't these facts illustrate the conspiracy of imperialism using religion for aggression? Today, there are still some imperialist elements in our Tianjin church who are wearing religious cloaks and engaging in espionage activities for the United States. Today, the day when our Tianjin Catholic Innovation Movement Promotion Association is established is also the day when we announce the death of imperialism within Catholicism. The task in the future is to resolutely sever all ties with imperialism, transform Catholicism into an undertaking run by the Chinese people themselves, and, together with the people of the whole country, assist the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and deeply carry out the movement to resist America and aid Korea. Only in this way can we win the sympathy of the people of the whole country."
    Hui Ruyu, Li Depei, Zhang Jizhong, and Yang Rang priests spoke in succession. They unanimously denounced the imperialist elements who mixed into the religious circles as demons in sheep's clothing with wolfish hearts, attempting to distort religious doctrines and spread toxins to paralyze Chinese believers and harm the interests of the Chinese people. They unanimously expressed their determination to show their anti-imperialist, patriotic, and religious stance with practical actions and to remove these criminals who betray the country and religion from the church.
    Father Liu Fudong, Chairman of the Beijing Catholic Anti-US and Aid Korea Association Preparatory Committee, also spoke at the meeting. He hoped that Catholics in Beijing and Tianjin would unite, heighten their vigilance against imperialism, and, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, work together to build a new China and a pure Chinese Catholicism.
    Catholic representatives Li Dongshan and Wu Dongchen unanimously stated in their speeches that Catholics in Tianjin firmly support the Catholic Innovation Movement, and are willing to truly implement the Three-Self innovation under the leadership of Chinese priests, and completely sever ties with imperialism.
    Li Huasheng, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government's Culture and Education Committee, pointed out in his speech that under the historical conditions that the Chinese people have victoriously stood up, it is no longer allowed for imperialism to manipulate Catholicism and use religion to carry out its aggressive conspiracies. Therefore, since the launch of the Tianjin Catholic Innovation Movement, it has not only had a great impact in Tianjin, but also has had a great impact in various parts of North China and the whole country. All regions support the innovation movement of the broad patriotic Catholics in Tianjin, and everyone has confidence that this movement can be successful. He also pointed out that it is completely consistent for Catholics to love their country and love their religion, and the future of Chinese Catholicism depends on whether it can love the country, implement innovation, and sever ties with imperialism. Moreover, the Chinese people are fully capable of running their own religious undertakings well without relying on any imperialism. Finally, he also pointed out that the Vatican is colluding with American imperialism and has long served as a tool for American imperialism's aggression against the world. If this continues, it will surely cut itself off from Catholics all over the world.
    At this point in the conference, all attendees stood up and took a solemn oath led by Wu Kezhai in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and the national flag.
    The full text of the membership oath is as follows:
    1. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will support the Common Program, abide by government policies and laws, respond to government calls, and promote the spirit of patriotism.
    2. Ideologically eliminate imperialist influence. Resolutely promote the thorough realization of the innovation movement of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation of Catholicism in China.
    3. Sincerely believe in the pure doctrines of Catholicism and do our best to promote them, so that Catholicism in China can maintain its holiness.
    4. Abide by the regulations of the Innovation Promotion Association, implement the resolutions of the Innovation Promotion Association, and consciously abide by discipline.
    5. Unite with Chinese Catholics and strive to build a new China that is independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous.
    If we violate the above aspirations, we are willing to accept sanctions.
    The conference also passed three telegrams to Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and Catholics across the country and around the world. Finally, Professor Fan Enkun of Tianjin University delivered the closing speech and the meeting adjourned.

　　天津天主教决彻底革新
　  举行盛会成立革新运动促进会
　  庄严宣誓与帝国主义割断联系
    【本报讯】天津市天主教革新运动促进会，于七日下午三时举行成立大会。这次大会的召开，是天津天主教的空前盛举，充分表示了天津天主教与帝国主义割断联系，彻底革新的决心。出席大会的除全市天主教徒代表吴克斋、张羽时、聂国屏等二百十八人外，并有天主教天津教区赵振亚副主教及全市各天主教堂全体中国神甫回如愚、李德培、张济众等三十人。该市人民政府文教委员会黄松龄主任委员、李华生副主任委员也出席了这个大会，并讲了话。北京刘福栋神甫、王汝楫神甫，教徒代表张汉民、祝福祥、谢斯骏等五人，也来天津参加了这个大会。
    大会总结了三个月来革新促进会筹委会的工作，确立了今后工作方针，并通过了天津市天主教革新运动促进会章程；选出革新促进会委员二十三人，候补委员三人；正式成立天津市天主教革新运动促进会。
    大会在向毛主席致敬、唱国歌后开始。通过吴克斋、赵振亚等十五人为主席团。主席吴克斋在致开会词时说：“这次大会表示着天津天主教友决心要本着反帝爱国爱教的精神，割断与帝国主义的联系，实行三自（自治、自养、自传，下同）。过去帝国主义分子对我们的爱国运动进行了卑鄙的阻挠，从事造谣、破坏、分化，使革新运动遭遇到了很多的困难。但是一万五千余中国神长与教友们在革新宣言上签名的事实，证明帝国主义分子的阴谋已经彻底失败了。”他指出今后要尽量揭发帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略的罪恶，坚决反对滥用神权、曲解教义的帝国主义行为。并指出革新运动不是排外，乃是要使天主教的主权握在中国神长手里，不受帝国主义辖制。他最后代表革新促进会感谢全体天津人民和人民政府的支援，并保证要在毛主席英明领导下，以实际行动来完成反帝爱国爱教的这一伟大任务。
    市人民政府文教委员会黄松龄主任委员代表天津市人民政府向大会诚恳祝贺。他在讲话时指出，天津天主教的革新运动的发展，是由于有着广大的群众基础；有骨干进行领导；有以赵振亚副主教为首的中国神长的支持和号召等三个条件，而且获得市人民政府的支持，因此获得了很大的成绩。这个运动将自天津推广到华北，推广到全国，而且对全世界天主教也将发生重大的影响。并指出，在今后的工作中还可能遭到困难，因此必须继续进行对帝国主义的斗争，进行天主教徒内部思想上的斗争，把残余的帝国主义影响彻底加以扫除。他的讲话，不断博得全场热烈的掌声。
    聂国屏代表革新促进会筹委会向大会报告筹委会成立以来三个月的工作，他说：“革新运动一开始，便使帝国主义分子感到惊心动魄，遭到了他们疯狂、卑鄙的阻挠。但经过促进会同人的努力，中国神长的指导和全体教友的协力，大家逐渐地认清了帝国主义的面目，签名的日见增多，达到了今天的成就。”最后他代表促进会向全体教友提出三点要求：一、加紧学习，提高政治觉悟，认清教义与帝国主义的区别，不再盲从，不再被帝国主义所利用。二、提高警惕，严防帝国主义重新复辟。三、加强中国神长和教友之间的团结，严防帝国主义分子的挑拨离间。
    赵振亚副主教在讲话时说：近百年来，天主教一贯被帝国主义利用，作为侵略的工具。他列举西开教案、“公教报国团”、美国间谍、神甫尚建勋、卜相贤等破坏我国主权等事实后说：“这些事实不正是说明帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略的阴谋吗？今天我们天津教会还有一些披着宗教外衣，为美国进行间谍活动的帝国主义分子。今天我们天主教革新运动促进会成立的日子，也就是宣布天主教内帝国主义死亡的日子。今后的任务就是要坚决的斩断与帝国主义的一切联系，把天主教变为中国人民自办的事业，并和全国人民一起协助政府镇压反革命，深入展开抗美援朝运动。只有这样，我们才能博得全国人民的同情。”
    回如愚、李德培、张济众及杨让神甫相继讲话。他们一致指斥混人宗教界中的帝国主义分子为外披羊皮、内怀狼心的恶魔，企图歪曲教义，散布毒素来麻痹中国信徒，侵害中国人民的利益。他们一致表示要以实际行动来表现自己反帝爱国爱教的决心，把这些叛国叛教的罪犯，从教会中清除出去。
    北京天主教抗美援朝会筹委会主席刘福栋神甫也在会上讲了话。他希望北京与天津的天主教徒团结在一起，提高对帝国主义的警惕，在毛主席的英明领导下，共同为建设新中国，建设纯洁的中国天主教而努力。
    教友代表李东山和吴东辰在讲话时，一致表示天津的天主教教友都坚决拥护天主教革新运动，愿意在中国神甫的领导下真正实行三自革新，彻底割断与帝国主义的联系。
    天津市人民政府文教委员会李华生副主任委员讲话时指出，在中国人民已经胜利站起来的历史条件下，就不再容许帝国主义操纵天主教，用宗教来进行它的侵略阴谋。因此，天津天主教革新运动自发动以来，不但在天津产生了很大影响，而且在华北各地和全国都有着很大的影响。各地都支持着天津广大的爱国教友的革新运动，大家也有信心能使这个运动得到成功。并指出天主教徒爱国与爱教是完全一致的，中国天主教的前途就决定于是否能爱国，实行革新，割断与帝国主义的联系。而且中国人民完全有能力办好自己的宗教事业，不必借助任何帝国主义。最后他并指出梵蒂冈教廷与美帝国主义相勾结，长期作为美帝国主义侵略全世界的工具，长此下去，必将自绝于全世界的天主教教徒。
    大会至此，全体出席者起立，在毛主席像及国旗前，由吴克斋领导，庄严宣誓。
    会员入会誓词全文如下：
    一、在毛主席领导下拥护共同纲领，遵守政府政策法令，响应政府号召，发扬爱国主义精神。
    二、在思想上肃清帝国主义影响。坚决促进在中国的天主教彻底实现自治、自养、自传的革新运动。
    三、虔诚信仰天主教纯真教义，并尽力宣扬，使在中国的天主教得以维持其圣洁性。
    四、遵守革新促进会会章之规定，执行革新促进会之决议，自觉遵守纪律。
    五、和中国的天主教教友团结在一起，为建设独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的新中国而奋斗。
    如违背以上志愿，甘受制裁。
    大会并通过致毛主席、中国人民志愿军及朝鲜人民军及全国、全世界教友等三个电文。最后由津沽大学范恩锟教授致闭会词后闭会。
