　　The resolution appealed to all friends of China to make the following demands to the British government: 1. Insist that the People's Republic of China must obtain its rightful status in the United Nations Organization, and revoke the dangerous resolution passed by the United Nations against the wishes of the majority of the world's people, accusing China of being an aggressor. 2. Take all possible steps to propose discussions on a peaceful resolution of the Far East issue, withdraw British troops from Korea to avoid the danger of war with China, and seek to resolve the Korean issue on the basis of the withdrawal of all foreign troops. 3. Ensure that no peace treaty with Japan is concluded without the participation of the People's Republic of China. 4. Immediately sever all ties with the Chiang Kai-shek Group, especially by closing the British consulate in Taiwan.
