　　Examples of American Imperialism Using Religious Groups to Invade China
　  ——A Record of the Espionage Activities of the American Catholic Church in Meixian, Guangdong

    The espionage and reactionary propaganda activities of American imperialism using religious groups against the Chinese people have once again been substantiated by conclusive evidence in the recently uncovered American espionage case in Meixian (Jiaying), Guangdong.

    Although Meixian is a mountainous area, it controls the transportation between Guangdong, Fujian, and Jiangxi provinces, and is one of the earliest birthplaces of the Chinese people's revolution, making it particularly noticed by American imperialists. The Catholic Church has been present here for one hundred and ten years. As early as 1840, the Paris Foreign Missions Society of France established a church in Meixian. In 1925, France transferred its ecclesiastical rights to the Maryknoll Fathers, an organization employed by American imperialism. Consequently, more than thirty American missionaries were dispatched to this region to carry out activities. They used Meixian as their center and extended their influence to the surrounding areas of Dabu, Jiaoling, Pingyuan, Xingning, Wuhua, Longchuan, Zhongxin, and Heping.

    Bishop Ford of Meixian was an American spy who had resided in China for a long time. He came to China in 1918 and had served as the Catholic Bishop of Yangjiang, Guangdong. He was one of the main leaders of the Maryknoll Fathers, a tool of American imperialism. In 1925, he represented the American Catholic Church at the "Nine-Power Treaty" conference on "extraterritoriality" in China. He was a figure of considerable standing in American religious circles.

    Materials seized by the public security department of the Xingmei People's Government of Guangdong Province show that this American Catholic Church, from the time it began to exist in Meixian, was an intelligence agency serving the American government; Bishop Ford was a very cunning, old-fashioned American spy.

  Sending Intelligence in Code

    For more than twenty years, Ford and his church collected a great deal of intelligence about China's military, political, and economic affairs for the American government. In addition to regularly inserting information in letters, church annual reports, and inter-church transfers, as well as Ford himself or other missionaries returning to their country periodically to report, they also secretly communicated with the American consulate using codes. A letter from the American Consul in Shantou, Sinkler, to Ford on January 24, 1935, revealed that they had used the Shantou Baptist Church's code to communicate with each other. On April 18, 1936, Sinkler sent Ford a cipher he had personally designed, saying in the letter, "Dear Bishop Ford: Here I send you a telegraphic cipher for your secret communication with this consulate. This cipher was designed by me specifically for this purpose."

  Providing Military Intelligence

    From the materials obtained, it was found that Bishop Ford had already been spying for American imperialism during the Chinese Revolution. More than a month before the Northern Expeditionary Force marched north from Guangdong, the American Vice-Consul in Shantou, Burland, wrote to Ford asking him to provide information on the number and movements of the Northern Expeditionary Force. The following is a letter from Burland to Ford on May 18, 1926:

        "Your Excellency:

        Significant military actions will evidently take place in the Chao-Mei region as a whole. The consulate is deeply observing the developments. We would be most grateful if you could promptly notify us of the troop movements that you may observe, especially their numbers and direction. Thank you in advance for your cooperation in this matter.

            C. B. (Signature)"

    After the failure of the Great Revolution, the Chinese people organized the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to fight against the Kuomintang reactionary regime that betrayed national interests. At this time, Ford received orders from the American consulate to be responsible for reconnaissance of the Red Army in his area.

    On October 14 and 30, 1929, Ford wrote to the American Consul in Shantou, Smith, to report on the direction of the Red Army's movements. In his letter of October 30, he said:

        "Dear Mr. Smith:

        I know you would like to receive information about the current situation in this area, and I can satisfactorily tell you what I know so far. ...On the 20th, the Communist troops went from Fujian to Zhenping City and then to Songyuan, but retreated to Zhenping within that week. ...On the 25th (Friday), they occupied Jiaying City. Our seminary was on the outskirts of the city, and we could clearly hear the gunfire. ...At four o'clock on Saturday, the government troops arrived and routed the enemy. ...It is reported that the Red Army has withdrawn up the river towards Shekeng and Fengshun...."

    On November 4, 1929, Smith, the American Consul in Shantou, ordered the American Catholic Church in Jiaying (i.e., Meixian) to provide information on the Red Army's liberation of Jiaying. The original letter stated:

        "To the gentlemen of the Catholic Church in Jiaying:

        We have heard that the Communist troops have captured Jiaying. ...I hope you can provide me with any information about this recent Communist occupation.

        At the same time, I also hope that you can obtain any information about the current movements of the Communist troops and the general situation in Jiaying.

            Smith (Signature)"

    On November 13, 1929, Ford replied to the American Consul Smith:

        "...Your letter of the 4th of this month, asking me about the news of the Communist troops' recent occupation of Jiaying, I had already mentioned in my letter of October 30. ...Since then, on October 31, the Communist troops attempted to capture the city again. ...Although there were only about 500 troops in the city, the Red Army was said to have 6,000 or 7,000 men. The government troops fought well, and by dusk, they finally defeated the enemy. Of course, they were not all armed. ..."

  Providing Information on Highways and Transportation

    After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese invaders occupied the Shantou area, and the mountainous area of Xingmei became the next target of their invasion. At this time, the American government, using the pretext of "making highway annual reports," ordered Bishop Ford to conduct intelligence work on highways and transportation in this area.

    A letter from the American Consul in Shantou, Eans, to Ford on July 15, 1940, said:

    "Sir:

        The Department of Commerce in Washington is preparing a highway annual report and requires this consulate to provide highway information as requested in the attached table for this consular district.

        Judging from the situation in this district over the past three years, it may not be possible to obtain complete materials, but I hope you can provide me with any materials you have on hand or can collect locally. Thank you for your help.

            Eans (Signature)"

    After receiving this letter, Bishop Ford, after more than two weeks of effort, wrote back to Eans, reporting on the entire highway network situation in northeastern Guangdong, and listing in detail the mileage, road stations, bridges, road surface, and other materials. This intelligence work was praised by the American Consulate in Shantou and Washington.

    From the documents exchanged between Eans and Ford around July 1941, it can also be seen that traffic intelligence work was a regular task for Ford. Thereafter, approximately every year or so, Bishop Ford reported to the American Consul in Shantou, "providing any new materials that may be available."

  Providing Agricultural and Economic Intelligence

    At the same time as providing highway information, the American government also ordered Bishop Ford to collect information on crops.

        A letter from the American Consul in Shantou, Eans, to Ford on September 4, 1940, said:

        "Sir:

        I am very grateful for the information you recently gave me about the highways in your area. I have now received inquiries from the Commercial Counselor in Shanghai regarding crops in this consular district. He wants to obtain the following information:

      (1) What is the expected citrus harvest this year? What is the percentage difference between this year and last year? Is the expected export volume higher or lower than last year?

      (2) How is sugarcane cultivation in your area? By what percentage is the estimated planting area expected to increase this year? How does this year's harvest compare to last year's? What is the percentage?

      (3) How much rice is planted? What is the degree of output? What is the percentage compared to last year? If possible, please estimate the yield.

      (4) How much rice needs to be imported from abroad from now until next summer? Is the import volume higher or lower than in the past twelve months? What are the possible sources of imports?

      (5) Please inform me of the price of rice.

      (6) Is there any rice being imported now? If so, please state from where it is exported and to where it is exported.

      (7) What is the output of other crops such as peanuts and beans? Is it higher or lower than last year?

    It is difficult to obtain materials on inland crops here, and efforts must still be made. I would be very grateful if you could give me as much information as possible. ...Missionaries can provide favorable information on this."

    Under such instructions, Bishop Ford issued the same notice to the twenty-five missionaries in his diocese. More than a month later, he received intelligence such as "Report on Agricultural Production in Pingyuan Area," "Report on Crops in the Mountainous Area of the Northern Region," "Report on the Southern Valley Land," and "Report on Crops in the Northwest." This intelligence was collected from farmers by American missionaries through their "parishioners" in various places. Ford compiled this information and reported it to Eans. Ford also told Eans: "Father Mei, a missionary in Dongshi, Pingyuan, reported that he spent several days completing the task for the request of the respectable Mr. Eans. Some residents are still very suspicious of his motives." Eans was very satisfied. In a letter to Ford on October 19, 1940, he said: "Dear Bishop Ford: I have received your letters of the 3rd and 5th of this month, providing me with a lot of information about the crops in your area. Thank you for your assistance in enabling me to provide the Agricultural Commissioner in Shanghai with a reasonable and clear picture of the development in this area."

  Providing Intelligence to the Japanese Invaders

    After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, Ford took on the task of providing intelligence to the Japanese invaders. The American Consul in Shantou, Young, wrote to Ford on December 4, 1939, under the pretext of protecting American property:

    "Sir:

    The Japanese Consul in Shantou has written requesting the collection of maps and floor plans of locations of American industries not yet occupied by the Japanese army in Chenghai, Chaoyang, Jieyang, and other towns and villages around Shantou or inland areas. He requests that the location of American industries be accurately marked on the maps or floor plans. After this material is collected, it will be submitted to the Japanese military authorities.

    The purpose of this letter is to request your assistance in providing me with as much material as possible on the locations of American Catholic Church industries in this consular district. You probably know that this consular district refers to the area east of longitude 115 degrees east in Guangdong Province. The Japanese Consul says that aerial reconnaissance has revealed many flags and symbols of third countries in various towns, making it difficult to distinguish between the genuine and the false.

    In accordance with this request, please send me all the materials you have as soon as possible, and please continue to inform me if you have any in the future.

        American Consul Young (Signature)"

    Isn't this letter the most obvious historical evidence of guilt? It is not difficult to imagine that much intelligence was sent by Ford via the American Consul to the hands of the Japanese invaders.

  The Drafter of "Solutions to the Communist Rebellion in Guangdong Province"

    After Japan surrendered, Ford returned to his country to report once. Soon after, he rushed back to China and actively helped the Kuomintang bandits oppose the Chinese people. In a letter to Father Robba on February 25, 1946, he said: "Government officials in Haifeng (referring to the Kuomintang bandits) now seem even more grateful for the anti-communist assistance given by Catholic missionaries."

    When the People's Liberation Army launched a major counter-offensive, Ford was very anxious about the defeat of the Kuomintang bandits. He wrote furiously against communism and issued frantic calls to his followers. He stipulated in his Easter address in 1948 that on "Dominica Day" on May 2 each year, "a special ceremony will be held to save Russia and oppose communism," using this ceremony to "conduct extensive propaganda."

    This American imperialist element in the guise of a missionary once drafted a so-called "Solutions to the Communist Rebellion in Guangdong Province" for Song Ziweng, which was discovered in a letter he gave to Father Herries of the South China General Seminary in Hong Kong on January 31, 1948. The detailed contents have not yet been discovered. The letter said:

    "Last week, a local official asked me to draft a 'Solutions to the Communist Rebellion in Guangdong Province.' He wanted to present this solution to Provincial Chairman Song Ziweng (of course, in his own name). ...I hesitated for a moment, but finally agreed. Drafting a solution to the communist rebellion in this area gave me an opportunity to express my views on the current situation, and I felt much better afterward. ...I often look for opportunities to influence some officials so that they can recognize what I think."

  Enemies of the Chinese People to the End

    When the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River and marched south, and the Guangdong Kuomintang bandits prepared to flee, Ford stated that he and his church resolutely opposed communism and would be enemies of the Chinese people to the end. In his annual report to the general assembly of the American Maryknoll Fathers on August 22, 1949, he said: "In the whole of China, only the church has always adopted a firm anti-communist stance." Fearing that he would be punished by the Chinese people, this cunning old American imperialist burned many "secret documents" that he "feared the Communist Party would know" and "hurriedly hid all important documents in a panic" (letter to Batavia on August 25, 1949).

    After the liberation of Meixian, Ford continued a series of criminal activities. In July 1949, he sent the hidden traitor Xu De abroad. Xu De was a Chinese clergyman from the Jining Diocese. In Ford's words, he was "someone who had been dealing with the Japanese authorities throughout the Japanese occupation period," so he was "disliked by the Communist Party." Like the traitors, the special agents and despotic elements hated by the Chinese people were also protected by Ford's church. In November 1950, the fugitive agent Zeng Zhonggan and the despotic landlord Zeng Weihua, who were wanted by the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, were sheltered by Ford and hid in the Meixian Catholic Church for more than a month under the name of "studying the truth," but were finally exposed and arrested by our public security organs.

    Ford also instigated church members to participate in counter-revolutionary armed organizations. In the "Wu Army (a Kuomintang bandit organization)" case cracked in Pingyuan in December 1949, one of the bandits named Liu Rengsheng was a Catholic. According to his confession, he had previously participated in the "Three People's Principles Restoration and National Salvation Group," and later joined the "Wu Army" at Ford's instigation.

    Ford also frequently made fallacious remarks in churches that slandered the People's Government and spread various rumors such as "the Third World War is about to break out." He also distributed "Today's America" and many other reactionary pamphlets. When patriotic Chinese Catholics launched the Three-Self Reform Movement, Ford was greatly panicked. He came up with a set of tricks and conspiracies to undermine this movement. In a report to his superiors, he said: "Economic arrangements have been prepared early." At the same time, "for the convenience of carrying out work," he planned to transfer the church to "local people in the future" in advance. ...And he drafted a "proactive transfer plan," listing a list of "local people" he considered "most reliable." That is to say, he attempted to undermine the patriotic movement of Chinese church members by means of false three-self.

  The Chinese People Will Tear Off the Sheepskins of Imperialist Missionaries

    The above materials were found in the documents remaining after Ford's burning and concealment, but they are enough to prove Ford's crimes. No matter how clever and vicious Ford's tricks are, he will not escape the sanctions of the Chinese people. At the request of the broad masses of the people, our People's Public Security Organs have arrested him! The Chinese people will tear off the sheepskins of these imperialist missionaries and expose their wolfish forms!

　　美帝国主义利用宗教团体侵华的实例
　  ——记广东梅县美国天主教会的间谍活动
    新华社记者　王匡
    美帝国主义利用宗教进行反对中国人民的间谍活动和反动宣传，在最近破获的广东梅县（嘉应）的美国间谍案中，再一次得到确凿的罪证。
    梅县虽然是个山区，但它是控制着广东、福建、江西三省交通的要冲，并且是中国人民革命最早的策源地之一，因此特别为美帝国主义者所注意。天主教会在这里已有一百一十年的历史。早在一八四○年，法国巴黎会就在梅县设立了教会。一九二五年，法国将教权转让给美帝国主义御用的玛丽诺外方传教会。于是，有三十多个美籍传教士被派遣到这一地区来进行活动。他们以梅县为中心，把势力伸布到周围的大埔、蕉岭、平远、兴宁、五华、龙川、忠信、和平等广大地区。
    梅县主教福尔德是一个长期居留中国的美国间谍。他于一九一八年来华，曾经做过广东阳江天主教主教。他是美国玛丽诺外方传教会的主要负责人之一。一九二五年曾代表美国天主教会出席“九国公约”的在华“治外法权”会议。他在美国宗教界中是一个有相当地位的人物。
    广东兴梅人民政府公安部门搜获到的材料显示：这个美国的天主教会，从它开始在梅县存在的时候起，就是替美国政府服务的情报机关；福尔德主教是一个十分狡猾的老牌的美国间谍。
  用密电码送情报
    二十几年来，福尔德和他的教会，给美国政府搜集了很多关于中国的军事、政治、经济的谍报。递送情报的方法，除了经常在信件中、在教会的年报中夹递、与其他教会互相传递，以及福尔德本人或其他传教士定期回国报告以外，还用密电码与美国领事馆秘密通报。一九三五年一月二十四日汕头美国领事辛克给福尔德的一封信，透露出他们曾借用汕头浸信会的密码互相通报。一九三六年四月十八日，辛克寄了一份由他亲自设计的密码给福尔德，他在信上说：“亲爱的福尔德主教：这里我寄给你一个电报密码，给你作为与本领事馆秘密通信之用。这个密码是我专为这个目的而设计的。”
  供给军事情报
    从已获得的材料中，发现福尔德主教早在中国大革命时期，就已为美帝国主义刺探情报。在北伐军由广东北伐前的一个多月，汕头的美国副领事柏兰曾致函福尔德，要他供给北伐军的人数和行动的情报。下面是一九二六年五月十八日柏兰给福尔德的信：
        “阁下：
        整个潮梅地区显然将有重要的军事行动，本领事馆深切地注意到有关的发展，你可能注意到的部队行动特别是它的人数和方向，设若能够及时通知我们，我们非常感激。关于你在这件事情上的合作，谨预致谢忱。
            Ｃ·Ｂ（签名）”
    大革命失败以后，中国人民组织了工农红军，对出卖民族利益的国民党反动政权进行斗争。在这时候，福尔德接到美国领事馆的命令，担任他所在地区的对红军的侦察工作。
    一九二九年十月十四日、三十日，福尔德先后致函汕头美国领事斯密斯报告红军的移动方向，他在十月三十日的信上说：
        “亲爱的斯密斯先生：
        我知道你愿意得到这一带目前局势的信息，我可以满意地将迄今为止的我所知道的消息告诉你。……二十日那天，共军从福建到镇平城，随即去了松源，但又在那一星期内退回镇平。……二十五日（星期五）他们进占了嘉应城，我们的修院在城郊，我们可以清楚地听到枪声。……在星期六四点钟的时候，政府军赶到击溃了敌人。……据报告红军已溯江撤向畬坑和丰顺……。”
    一九二九年十一月四日汕头美领事斯密斯令嘉应（即梅县）美国天主教会供给关于红军解放嘉应的情报，原信称：
        “嘉应天主教会诸位先生：
        我们听说共军攻陷了嘉应，……我希望你们能供给我关于最近这次共军占领的任何消息。
        同时，我还希望能由你们取到关于现在共军移动及嘉应一般形势的任何情报。
            斯密斯（签名）”
    一九二九年十一月十三日，福尔德函复美领事斯密斯称：
        “……你本月四号的来信，问我关于共军最近占领嘉应的消息，我在十月三十日的信里已经预先说到了。……此后在十月三十一日，共军曾再一次试图攻夺这个城，……在城内的军队虽然只有五百人左右，而红军据说则有六、七千人。政府军打得很好，及至黄昏，终于把敌人击溃，当然，他们并不是全都有武器。……”
  供给公路交通情报
    抗日战争爆发以后，日寇侵占汕头一带，兴梅山地成为日寇下一步的侵略目标。这时，美国政府以“作公路年报”为词。命令福尔德主教进行这一地区公路交通的情报工作。
    一九四○年七月十五日汕头美国领事意恩斯给福尔德的信说：
    “先生：
        华盛顿商务部准备公路年报，要本领事提供本领区内如附表所要求的公路情报。
        由本区过去三年的情形看，想得到完整的材料恐不可能，但我希望你能把手边有的或是可以由地方上搜集到的任何材料供给我。感谢你的帮忙。
            意恩斯（签名）”
    福尔德主教接到这封信以后，经过两个多星期的努力，即写回信给意恩斯，报告了广东东北部的整个公路网情况，并详列公路英里数、路站、桥梁、路面等材料。这件情报工作曾得到汕头美领事馆和华盛顿的赞许。
    从一九四一年七月间意恩斯、福尔德往来文件中，还可以看出交通情报工作是福尔德的一项经常的工作。此后约每隔一年左右，福尔德主教就向汕头的美领事报告一次，“提供任何可能有的新材料”。
  供给农业经济情报
    与供给公路情报同时，美国政府又命令福尔德主教搜集有关农作物的情报。
        一九四○年九月四日，汕头美领事意恩斯给福尔德的信说：
        “先生：
        最近你给我关于贵区公路的资料，甚为感激。现又接到上海商务专员关于本领事区内农作物的询问，他要获得以下的情报：
      （一）预计今年柑桔收成如何？按百分比今年和去年相差多少？预计今年出口量比去年多或少？
      （二）你区蔗的种植如何？估计今年的播种面会增加百分之多少？估计本年与去年的收成比较如何？其百分比大小？
      （三）稻谷种植多少？产量程度如何？和去年相比，其百分比大小如何？如可能请估计其产量。
      （四）从现在起至明年夏季需要自国外输入多少米？输入量比过去十二个月多还是少？输入的可能来源是何处？
      （五）请告知米谷的价格。
      （六）现在米有无进口？如有的话，请说明自何处输出，输到何处去？
      （七）其他农作物如花生、豆类产量如何？比去年多还是少？
    在此很难获得内地农作物材料，还须设法努力。如能尽量给我资料，我是非常感激的。……传教士能供给对此有利的情报。
            意恩斯（签名）”
    福尔德主教在这样的指示下，便向他教区内的二十五个传教士发出同样的通知。一个多月以后，他收到了“平远区农产情况报告”、“北部地区山地关于农作物的报告”、“南部山谷地的报告”、“西北部农作物的报告”等情报。这些情报都是由各地美籍传教士通过他们的“教友”向农民搜集来的。福尔德把这些情报综合起来，报告给意恩斯。福尔德还告诉意恩斯：“平远东石传教士梅神父的报告上说，为了可敬的意恩斯先生的要求，他费了好几天的时间，才完成任务。有些居民们对他的动机还很怀疑。”意恩斯感到非常满意。在一九四○年十月十九日写给福尔德的信中说：“亲爱的福尔德主教：我已接到你本月三日和五日的来信，供给我很多关于贵区农作物的资料，感谢你的协助，使我能够向上海农业专员提供本区发展的合理且清晰的一幅图画。”
  给日本侵略者送情报
    在一九三七年日本侵略中国的战争发生后，福尔德担负了供给日本侵略军情报的任务。汕头美国领事杨格曾于一九三九年十二月四日以保护美国人财产为名，写信给福尔德称：
    “先生：
    汕头日本领事来函要求搜集美国产业所在而尚未被日军占领之澄海、潮阳、揭阳和汕头四周其他城市乡村或内地地方之地图和平面图，他要求在地图或平面图上要精确地标明美国国产业的位置，这类材料搜集好之后，将送交日本军事当局。
    本函的目的就是请你协助把本领事区内的美国天主教会产业所在地的材料尽量地供给我。你大概晓得本领事区是指广东省东经度一一五度以东的地方，日本领事称，自空侦察，在各城镇上有很多第三国的旗子和标志，难于辨其真伪。
    依此要求请即将你所有的材料迅速寄来，以后如有亦希陆续告我。
        美领事杨格（签名）”
    这封信不是一个最明显的历史罪证吗？不难想见，有许多情报由福尔德转经美国领事送达日本侵略军之手。
  “广东省共乱解决办法”的起草人
    日本投降以后，福尔德曾回国作了一次报告，不久便赶回中国，积极地帮助国民党匪帮反对中国人民。他在一九四六年二月二十五日写给鲁巴（Robba）神父的信中说：“海丰的政府官员（按指国民党匪帮）们现在似乎更加感谢天主教传教士所给予的反共援助”。
    当人民解放军大举反攻以后，福尔德因国民党匪帮的溃败感到十分焦急，他大写其反共文章，向其所属的教徒发出疯狂的叫嚣。他在一九四八年的复活节上规定每年五月二日“主日”那天，“为着拯救俄国和反对共产主义而举行一次特别仪式”，利用这种仪式“作广泛的宣传”。
    这位披着传教士外衣的美帝国主义分子，曾经替宋匪子文拟了一个所谓“广东省共乱解决办法”，这是从他在一九四八年一月三十一日给香港华南总修院赫利斯神父的信中发现的，详细内容至今尚未查获。那封信上说：
    “上星期本地有一个官员请我草拟一个‘广东省共乱解决办法’，他想把这个办法送呈省主席宋子文（当然用其本人名义），……我犹疑片刻，但终于答应了。草拟本地区之共乱解决办法，这就给了我一次对现势发表我的意见的机会，事后我觉得痛快多了。……我常想找机会能够影响些官员，使他们认识到我所想的。”
  与中国人民为敌到底
    当我人民解放军渡过长江，挥师南下，广东国民党匪帮准备逃窜时，福尔德表示他和他的教会坚决反共，与中国人民为敌到底。他在一九四九年八月二十二日给美国玛丽诺外方传教会总会的年报中说：“就全中国来说，只有教会一向采取了坚定的反共产主义的立场”。这位老奸巨猾的美帝国主义分子害怕会受到中国人民的惩罚，因此他烧毁了许多“怕共产党知道”的“秘密文件”，又在“慌乱之中，急忙把所有重要的文件都收藏起来了”（一九四九年八月二十五日给巴达维亚代收的信）。
    福尔德在梅县解放以后，继续进行了一连串的罪恶活动。一九四九年七月，他将窝藏着的汉奸许德遣送到国外去，许德是集宁教区的华籍教士，用福尔德的话来说，他是“在整个日本占领期内，一直与日本当局往来”因此为“共产党所不喜欢的人”。与汉奸一样为中国人民所痛恨的特务、恶霸分子，也受到福尔德的教会的庇护。一九五○年十一月，被江西省人民政府追缉的逃犯特务曾中干、恶霸地主曾维华，在福尔德的庇护下，在梅县天主堂以“学道理”为名，匿避了一个多月之久，但终于被我公安机关识破，加以逮捕。
    福尔德并唆使教徒参加反革命的武装组织。一九四九年十二月，在平远破获的“乌军（系一国民党土匪组织）”案中，有一个名叫刘壬生的土匪是天主教徒。据他招供，过去曾参加“三民主义维新救国团”，后在福尔德的怂恿下参加了“乌军”。
    福尔德更经常在教堂中发表毁谤人民政府的谬论，传播“第三次世界大战就要爆发”等各种谣言。他还散布“今日之美国”及其他许多反动的小册子。当爱国的中国天主教徒发起三自革新运动以后，福尔德大为恐慌。他想出了一套诡计，阴谋破坏这个运动。他在他的上级的一个报告中说：“经济上的布置早有准备了。”同时，“为了开展工作方便”，他计划把教会预先转给“未来的本地人手中”。………并拟定了一个“主动转移的计划”，开列了一张他认为“最可靠”的“本地人”的名单。这就是说，他企图以假三自的方法来破坏中国教徒的爱国运动。
  中国人民要撕下帝国主义传教士的羊皮
    以上的材料，是在福尔德焚毁和掩护后所剩余下来的文件中发现的，但已足够证明福尔德的罪行了。尽管福尔德的诡计是多么巧妙和恶毒，但他毕竟逃不开中国人民的制裁。我人民公安机关应广大人民的要求，已将他逮捕！中国人民要剥下这些帝国主义传教士的羊皮，叫他们露出豺狼的原形来！
