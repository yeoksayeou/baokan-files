    (8) The mutual aid team members, carrying plows and seeders, with baskets, cotton seeds, and old shoes, pull their livestock, and head towards the fields. The villagers watch, unable to figure out what's happening. Second Aunt even mocks them for being possessed.
    (9) When everyone arrives in the fields, they quickly get to work. Wang Shan operates the seeder, Da Chun binds the shoe soles, Xi Ni’er leads the livestock, and Er Ben puts on the harness, all working non-stop.
    (10) After plowing one row, the results are very good. Everyone divides into two groups: Er Ben leads the livestock in front to expose the dry soil; Wang Shan and the others follow behind to sow the cotton seeds in the moist soil. In just a few days, the entire team has planted all 24.5 mu of cotton.
    (11) The villagers, seeing that this method saves labor and effort, all crowd into Wang Shan's house to learn. They then go to other mutual aid teams to help everyone carry out the work of "exposing dry soil and sowing in the moist soil" (meaning to remove the dry soil and sow in the moist soil).

    （八）互助组的人们扛着犁、耧，带着篮子、棉籽和旧鞋，拉着牲口，向地里走去。村里的人瞧见，摸不清是怎么回事。二大娘也讥笑他们是活见鬼。
    （九）大家到了地里，赶忙动起手来。王山掌耧大椿绑鞋底，喜妮儿牵牲口，二笨上套，忙个不停。
    （十）大家拉了一趟，成绩很好。大家又分成两组：二笨在前面赶着牲口豁干土；王山他们跟着就把棉籽耩播在湿土上。几天工夫，全组二十四亩半棉花，全都种上了。
    （十一）村里的人，一看这个办法省工又省力，都挤到王山屋里来学习。他们便分别到其他互助组里，帮助大家进行豁干耩湿的工作（豁去干土，耩出湿土的意思）。
