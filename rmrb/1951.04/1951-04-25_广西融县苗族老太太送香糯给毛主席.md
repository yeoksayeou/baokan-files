To the Editor:

    One day, a Miao old woman came to the front of the barracks of a certain regiment stationed in Rong County, Guangxi Province. She was carrying a package and asked the sentry, "Comrade, are Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu here? I'm here to deliver something."

    It turned out that fourteen or fifteen years ago, the Red Army's Long March passed through her hometown – the Miao region in northern Guangxi. The Miao people, who had suffered from the persecution and oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary government, personally experienced that the Red Army was their own army and learned about the people's leaders, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. During these long years, they had been waiting for the Red Army to save them and caring about the health of the people's leader, Chairman Mao. This Miao old woman was representing the wishes of the Miao people, coming to deliver fragrant glutinous rice.

    When the instructor told her, "Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu are both in Beijing, commanding the army to continue to eliminate the reactionaries and leading the people of all ethnic groups across the country to build a new China. We are the army sent by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to fight the reactionaries," the old woman said excitedly, "Since you are sent by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, please taste a little of this bag of fragrant glutinous rice, it's as if Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu have eaten it!" Then she said, "We have been waiting for you all the time. Now that you have really come, we are all so happy that we can't sleep, and even the children have grown a little taller!"

    When she went back, the instructor gave her two portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. She shouted happily, "These are our saviors, I have seen them!" She looked at them again and again, tears of joy in her eyes; finally, she carefully rolled them up and took them home.

    广西融县苗族老太太送香糯给毛主席编辑同志：
    广西省融县驻军某部的营房门前，有一天来了一个苗族老太太。她手里提着一包东西，见了哨兵就问：“同志啊，毛主席、朱总司令在这里吗？我是来送东西的。”
    原来在十四五年以前，红军北上长征的队伍曾经经过她的家乡——桂北苗区。受尽国民党反动政府迫害和蹂躏的苗胞，亲身体验到红军是自己的队伍，并且知道了人民领袖毛主席和朱总司令。在这漫长的岁月里，他们一直在等待着红军来拯救自己，关怀着人民领袖毛主席的健康。这位苗族老太太，正是代表着苗胞的心意，来送香糯的。
    当指导员告诉她：“毛主席、朱总司令都在北京，正指挥军队继续消灭反动派，领导全国各族人民建设新中国。我们就是毛主席、朱总司令派来打反动派的军队。”老太婆很激动地说：“你们既是毛主席、朱总司令派来的，这包香糯就请你们每人尝一点吧，这也就像毛主席、朱总司令吃了一样！”接着她说：“我们成天等着你们。如今，你们真的来了。我们个个喜欢得睡不着觉，连娃崽（即小孩）也都多长高了一点啦！”
    她回去时，指导员送给她两张毛主席、朱总司令的像。她高兴地喊道：“这就是我们的救星，我见了他们啦！”她看了又看，喜欢的眼里流出了泪；最后，才卷得好好的带回家去了。
