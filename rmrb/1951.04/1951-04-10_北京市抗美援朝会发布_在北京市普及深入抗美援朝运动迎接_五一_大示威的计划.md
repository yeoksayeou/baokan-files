Based on the March 14th circular from the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association, and the decision made at the enlarged meeting of this association on April 2nd, to ensure that every place and every person receives patriotic education in resisting America and aiding Korea, and to welcome the "May Day" grand demonstration, this association has decided to mobilize all democratic parties, groups, organizations, factories, and schools in Beijing to carry out the following tasks:

  I. Each unit shall convene meetings to mobilize and formulate specific plans.

 II. Various groups and districts shall organize mass meetings, large and small, to conduct various forms of
        propaganda (including denunciations). Through mass discussions, the following signatures or votes shall be passed:

    (1) Supporting the conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers;

    (2) Opposing the United States arming Japan;

    (3) Establishing patriotic pacts (those that have already been established should check their implementation and do not need to be re-established);

    (4) Establishing anti-spy and anti-special agent pacts.

    The above mass signatures or votes must be completed before the end of April.

III. Conduct regular current affairs propaganda and patriotic education:

    (1) The Propaganda Department of the Beijing Anti-American and Aid-Korea Association will issue "Key Points for Popularizing and Deepening the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Patriotic Movement."

    (2) In factories, through spare-time schools, reading groups, blackboard newspapers, and broadcasts, report important current events of the day, and convene workshop group meetings or factory-wide meetings, large and small. After propaganda and explanation, pass the aforementioned signatures or votes. Large factories should organize propaganda teams to conduct propaganda to workers' families and nearby residents. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions should organize propaganda teams to conduct propaganda at the work locations of workers in various district industries.

    (3) In addition to implementing patriotic education in all subjects in middle schools, establish a system of current affairs reports, where political teachers or other responsible teachers report and explain important current events of the day during class breaks. This will encourage teachers and students to pay attention to current affairs studies. During the April spring break, organize college and middle school students to conduct propaganda work to the masses in urban and suburban areas. Afterwards, without affecting their studies, organize small propaganda teams to regularly conduct oral and written propaganda to nearby factories and residents. Mobilize primary school teachers to contact students' parents for propaganda.

    (4) Various districts in the city should organize the strength of workers, youth, women, and other group organizations, and organs, divide areas, conduct universal propaganda work, and organize various mass meetings, large and small, for residents to pass the aforementioned signatures or votes.

    (5) Suburban areas should use the propaganda teams of college and middle school students going to the countryside during the spring break to organize peasant meetings in each village to conduct propaganda and pass the aforementioned signatures or votes. At the same time, organize cadres and primary school teachers in suburban areas to establish regular current affairs propaganda work, such as blackboard newspapers and reading groups.

    (6) In shops and all public places, such as parks, theaters, cultural centers, squares, rural clubs in suburban areas, reading rooms, etc., art groups should work with relevant shops and responsible units to arrange various propaganda materials (paintings, pictures, models, slogans), and literary and artistic groups should conduct various literary and artistic propaganda activities.

    (7) When various propaganda teams conduct propaganda among the masses, through symposiums, denunciation meetings, and resident visits, collect the crimes of American and Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, record and publish them.

IV. The work steps and methods of various groups, districts, and agencies are as follows:

    (1) Major factories and mines should conduct propaganda and deliberation in the first half of April, and universally launch various activities inside and outside the factory in the second half of April. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions will convene representative meetings of porters, shop assistants, and small factory workers in early April to mobilize, discuss, and pass various covenants. Factories that have not conducted denunciations of the crimes of the United States, Japan, and Chiang Kai-shek should launch denunciations in the second half of April.

    (2) Universities will deploy 7,000 propaganda team members during the spring break in early April to go to various villages in the suburbs to carry out propaganda work. College and middle school students should divide regions and conduct regular propaganda activities in various districts, and the propaganda targets should be unified and planned in detail by each district.

    (3) Various districts in the city should universally convene various representative meetings in the first half of April, organize district street representatives, cadres of agencies and groups, and activists among the masses, divide areas (based on police stations), and launch universal propaganda activities in the second half of April, with each unit responsible for conducting inspections separately.

    (4) Various suburban districts should combine spring plowing work in early April to convene village meetings or representative meetings to publicize and discuss the passage of various covenants.

    (5) The Democratic Women's Federation will convene municipal and district cadre meetings and women's representative committee meetings and women's representative meetings from all walks of life in the first half of April to mobilize and assign work tasks.

    (6) In addition to organizing current affairs learning in early April, the business community should focus on arranging window propaganda and promoting it throughout the city.

    (7) Agencies should universally strengthen current affairs learning in April and organize propaganda forces to conduct resident propaganda in the vicinity.

    (8) Literary and art groups should convene meetings to arrange work and prepare literary and art propaganda materials.

    (9) All units should check the progress of their work at any time, and in late April, prepare for the "May Day" demonstration parade.
