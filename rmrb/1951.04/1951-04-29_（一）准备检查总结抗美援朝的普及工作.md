　　(I) Preparing to Inspect and Summarize the Popularization Work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea
Following the May Day anti-U.S. aggression and aid Korea mass demonstration parade, all regions should promptly inspect and summarize the popularization of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea movement to serve as the basis for further developing the movement in the future.

The content of the inspection and summary should first focus on the breadth of popularization, that is, to genuinely investigate whether the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea movement has reached the point where it is known to every household. Although this popularization movement has greatly advanced the propaganda and education campaign of Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, it is inevitable that some blank areas or blank spots will remain. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully examine how many people in each region have received anti-American patriotic education, and how many people have not received this education, in order to continue to address these remaining issues in future movements and completely eliminate the blank spots.

Secondly, the inspection and summary should focus on the extent to which the people understand U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism is a long-term and arduous one, and so is the task of eliminating the insidious influence left by U.S. imperialism among the Chinese people. After several months of patriotic movements, especially the recent popularization movement, the fear, admiration, and pro-American sentiments that have long existed among some people have been severely impacted, but they cannot be completely eradicated all at once. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a thorough inspection to determine, based on evidence, which issues should be the focus of future efforts.

The propaganda methods and approaches adopted in the popularization movement should also be summarized. Currently, various regions across the country are using many different methods for propaganda, with some places having as many as two hundred different types. It is important to analyze and study which of these methods can be widely promoted, and which are effective for certain people, certain places, or at certain times. This will be extremely helpful for further developing the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea movement.

The summary work should not only be based on written reports from lower-level agencies, but more importantly, it should involve going down to the grassroots level to truly investigate the extent of the people's understanding. Spot-checking a few factories, villages, schools, and hutongs can provide insight into the true state of the masses' thinking. Only based on such inspections can good summaries be made, and it can be accurately determined what experiences should be promoted and what shortcomings should be corrected.

The purpose of inspecting and summarizing the propaganda and education work of Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea is to promote future work. Therefore, based on this inspection and summary, a regular plan should be established to carry out the propaganda and education work of Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea regularly and persistently.

　　（一）准备检查总结抗美援朝的普及工作
    在五一节抗美援朝大示威游行后，各地都应该及时检查总结抗美援朝普及的情形，来作为今后深入开展抗美援朝运动的依据。
    检查总结的内容，首先就是普及的广度，就是要切实研究一下抗美援朝运动是否达到了家喻户晓的地步。这次的普及运动，虽然已把抗美援朝的宣传教育运动大大推进了一步，但是，不可免地仍会有一些空白区或空白点遗留下来，所以必须认真检查每一个地区究竟有多少人受到了反美爱国教育，还有多少人没有受到这种教育，以便在今后的运动中继续解决这些遗留问题，把空白点彻底消灭。
    其次要检查总结的，就是人民群众对于美帝国主义的认识程度。中国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，是长期而艰巨的，要肃清美帝国主义在中国人民中留下的恶毒影响，也是长期而艰巨的斗争。经过几个月来的爱国运动，特别是最近的普及运动，长期存在于一部分人民群众中的恐美、崇美以及亲美思想，已经受到严重打击；但还不能一下子彻底肃清。因此，必须加以切实检查，以便有根据地确定今后集中力量解决那些问题。
    对于在普及运动中所采取的宣传方法、方式，也应该加以总结。现在，全国各地都采用很多方式进行宣传，有的地方，竟达二百多种。其中有那些是可以普遍推广的，那些是对某些人，某些地方、在某些时间是有效的，都应该加以分析研究。这对于今后深入开展抗美援朝运动是会极有助益的。
    总结工作，不要仅仅根据下级机关的书面汇报，更重要的是要到下面去，确实调查人民群众的认识程度。抽查几个工厂，几个村庄，几个学校，几个胡同，就可以了解群众思想的真实状况。根据这样的检查，才能作出好的总结，正确确定要发扬什么经验，纠正什么缺点。
    检查、总结抗美援朝宣传教育工作的目的，是为了推动今后的工作，因此，要根据这种检查总结，定出经常性的计划来，把抗美援朝的宣传教育工作经常持久地进行下去。
