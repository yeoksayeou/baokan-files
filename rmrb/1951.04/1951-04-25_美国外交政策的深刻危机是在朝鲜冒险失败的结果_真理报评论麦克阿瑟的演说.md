Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 23rd: Pravda's foreign affairs commentator, Oliehov, wrote in a commentary on the deepening crisis of American foreign policy: News from American newspapers reveals that the struggle within the American ruling group over foreign policy issues has further intensified. This struggle, triggered by the deep crisis of aggressive American foreign policy, has reached an unsolvable point as a result of the failure of the American adventure in the Korean War.

Under these circumstances, Truman decided to dismiss MacArthur in an attempt to portray the crisis in American foreign policy as MacArthur's "personal crisis" and to shift the responsibility for the failure of the American military adventure in Korea onto MacArthur. MacArthur's speech to Congress upon his return to the United States once again proved that the cause of the crisis was the failure of the adventure in Korea.

In his speech, MacArthur attempted to explain why he could not handle the situation in Korea, or in other words, why American policy there had suffered a disastrous defeat. No matter how much MacArthur twisted and turned to "explain" his misfortune, his speech still proved the bankruptcy of American Far Eastern policy.

MacArthur raged and fumed, yet he had to admit that Asia was no longer what it was when "China was completely an uncooperative country, divided into many mutually hostile groups." MacArthur said that China is now unified. It is the "dominant force in Asia."

In an effort to defend the American military failure in Korea, MacArthur told one lie after another. He claimed that he did not receive reinforcements. However, everyone knows that the United States concentrated hundreds of thousands of troops in Korea, and reinforcements were constantly being shipped there.

MacArthur also said that he was not allowed to blockade the Chinese coast. However, everyone knows that the US Navy has in fact blockaded the Chinese coast.

MacArthur asserted that in order to win in Korea, he needed to invade Chinese territory with the Air Force. However, everyone knows that American aircraft have in fact constantly attacked Chinese territory in the past and continue to do so now.

Everyone knows that when Truman issued the order to dismiss MacArthur, he attempted to create the impression that MacArthur's actions violated the instructions of the US government and the high command. MacArthur's explanation completely overturned Truman's claim. From MacArthur's explanation, it is perfectly clear that his actions were entirely in accordance with the plans of the US government and the US military command.

This statement by the bankrupt "chieftain" caused confusion in the White House and the Pentagon (US Department of Defense). The Department of Defense, on Truman's instructions, immediately issued a "denial" statement. However, the "denial" does not "deny" anything, because it cannot deny that the Department of Defense and MacArthur share the same views on American Far Eastern policy and strategy.

This once again proves that Truman's clumsy attempt to shirk responsibility for the failure of the Korean adventure has failed. The internal struggle within the American ruling group proves that the crisis of American policy is further intensifying.

### 美国外交政策的深刻危机是在朝鲜冒险失败的结果  真理报评论麦克阿瑟的演说

　　美国外交政策的深刻危机是在朝鲜冒险失败的结果
　  真理报评论麦克阿瑟的演说
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：真理报外交评论员奥列贺夫在评论美国外交政策的日益加深的危机时写道：美国报纸消息透露，美国统治集团内部在外交政策问题上的斗争进一步加剧。美国侵略性外交政策的深刻危机所引起的这一斗争，由于美国在侵朝战争中遭到失败的结果，已经到了无法解决的地步。
    在这些情况下，杜鲁门遂决定撤免麦克阿瑟的职位，这样企图把美国外交政策的危机说成是麦克阿瑟的“个人危机”，把美国在朝鲜军事冒险失败的责任推在麦克阿瑟头上。麦克阿瑟在回到美国后向国会发表的演说又一次证明了：危机的原因是在朝鲜的冒险的失败。
    麦克阿瑟在其演说中企图解释他为什么不能应付朝鲜的局势，换言之，为什么美国政策在那里遭到了惨败。不论麦克阿瑟如何转弯抹角企图“解释”他的不幸，他的演说仍然证明了美国远东政策的破产。
    麦克阿瑟暴跳如雷，然而，他不得不承认亚洲已和“中国完全是一个不和协的国家，划分为许多互相敌对的集团”的时候不一样了。麦克阿瑟说，中国现在已经统一了。它是“亚洲的支配力量”。
    为了力图辩解美国在朝鲜的军事失败，麦克阿瑟撒出一个又一个的谎言。他声言，他没有得到援军。然而每一个人都很知道，美国在朝鲜集中了数十万军队，援军源源不绝地运到那里去。
    麦克阿瑟又说，他未被允许封锁中国海岸。然而每个人都知道，事实上美国海军已封锁了中国海岸。
    麦克阿瑟断言，要在朝鲜获胜，他需要以空军侵犯中国领土。然而谁都知道美国飞机实际上过去和现在都不断地侵袭中国领土。
    大家都知道，杜鲁门在发布撤免麦克阿瑟的命令时企图造成这样的印象：麦克阿瑟的行动违背了美国政府与高级指挥部的指示。麦克阿瑟的解释完全推翻了杜鲁门的这种说法。从麦克阿瑟的解释中，可以完全清楚地看到，他的行动完全依照着美国政府与美国军事指挥部的计划。
    破产了的“头目”的这个声明，在白宫与五角大楼（美国国防部）引起混乱。国防部奉杜鲁门的指示立刻制造“否认”声明。然而，“否认”并不能“抵赖掉”什么，因为它抵赖不掉国防部与麦克阿瑟对于美国远东政策与战略的意见是相同的。
    这再度证明了杜鲁门企图推卸朝鲜冒险失败的责任的笨拙计策已归于失败。美国统治集团的内部斗争证明了美国政策的危机进一步加剧。
