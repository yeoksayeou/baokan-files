　　Wu Kezhai's Opening Speech

　　Respected leaders and guests, respected clergy and fellow Catholics:

　　Today, we are very honored to have this opportunity to invite leaders and people from both inside and outside the Catholic Church to attend the inaugural meeting of the Tianjin Catholic Church Reform Movement Promotion Association. This is indeed an unprecedented event for the Catholic Church in Tianjin, indicating our determination as Tianjin Catholics to thoroughly eliminate the poison of imperialism from the Church, to bring the broad masses of Catholics closer to the people, and to stand tall as our motherland grows stronger.

　　As everyone knows, our country has suffered from imperialist aggression for nearly a hundred years. At the same time, since Catholicism was introduced to China, it has been used as a tool of aggression by imperialists, which is an undeniable fact. Historically, many wars of aggression against China were launched under the pretext of religious cases. A series of unequal treaties contained "missionary privileges" in China, with the aim of using missionary work as a cover to carry out conspiracies to invade our country.

　　We, the Catholic faithful, are determined to stand up with the people of the whole country in the spirit of anti-imperialism, patriotism, and love for the Church, resolutely wash away the stains of the Catholic Church in the past, resolutely sever all ties with imperialism, and implement self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation (hereinafter referred to as the "Three-Selfs"), and will never be utilized by imperialism. Imperialist elements have engaged in despicable obstruction of our patriotic movement, engaging in rumors, sabotage, and division, causing many difficulties for patriotic and Church-loving people; however, we believe that we have the strength and confidence to overcome them. Up to now, more than 15,000 clergy and fellow Catholics have signed the declaration of reform, which proves that the imperialist elements' conspiracies have been completely defeated.

　　However, the imperialist elements are not reconciled to their defeat, and they are still continuing to carry out sabotage; we must be vigilant, unite, and resolutely fight against the imperialist elements to strive for the complete victory of the reform movement.

　　The basic spirit of the reform movement has been stated in the declaration, and I will not repeat it here. I would just like to put forward two more points:

　　First: Our reform movement today can only be said to have taken the first step. We have not yet settled the crimes of imperialism using the Church to carry out aggression against our country for hundreds of years. We must expose the evils that imperialism has inflicted on religion as much as possible. Only in this way can we educate the Catholics who have been deceived and anesthetized in the past, and truly recognize the ugliness of imperialism; only in this way can we wash away the stains of the Catholic Church and restore the purity of Catholicism. The Catholics of Xikai and Wanghailou have recently held many accusation meetings, which is very good. The imperialist element Wen Guibin of Xikai is still posting notices in the priests' building to this day, slandering our anti-imperialist, patriotic, and Church-loving Three-Selfs movement; we cannot compromise with him. At the beginning of our Three-Selfs movement, he used threats and obstructions such as going to hell, stopping divine service, being a "devil," and being a traitor. Later, seeing that it had no effect, he admitted that the signatories were not devils and would not go to hell. Today, he is fabricating that we are "plotting against the legitimate authorities of the Church" and want to announce "the Pope's punishment of abandonment to us." We resolutely oppose this imperialist behavior of abusing divine power and distorting Catholic doctrine.

　　Second: The reform movement is not xenophobic, but aims to ensure that the sovereignty of the Catholic Church is in the hands of Chinese clergy, and is not subject to the control of imperialism, like other countries in the world. Because today our China is a strong country, and our Chinese Catholic Church must also become stronger with it. But the imperialist elements say: this is "offending superiors" and "apostasy." Fellow Catholics! We believe in the "Church," not the "people"; we believe in the "Gospel of Jesus Christ," not the "orders of the imperialist elements." Some people are still covering up for the imperialist elements, saying that they are "supra-national" and "supra-political"; but now we are awake, and apart from carrying out sabotage activities under this smokescreen, what they say is nothing but deceiving us into forgetting our motherland! For example, the recent uncovering of the American spy Father Lei Zhenyuan's vast spy organization, the Catholic Patriotic League, organized in five provinces and three cities in the North China Diocese, recruited many priests and Catholics to engage in espionage activities. The day before yesterday, the government also accepted the requests of teachers and students of Tianjin University and Catholics and arrested the three American spies Bu Xiangxian, Bao Yihua, and Fang Ruhui. They wear the cloak of religion, but engage in espionage. If it were not for the wisdom of the current government, not only would there be "religious cases," but Catholicism would probably not be able to be spread in China! Now the reform movement in various regions of the country has risen up, which proves that the vast majority of Catholics in the country have a common goal of patriotism and anti-imperialism, and similarly realize that our Chinese Catholic Church can no longer tolerate the oppression, fooling, and utilization of imperialist elements, and must sever any ties with them. Every faithful Catholic should have determination. Clergy and Catholics all over the country, act quickly! Don't hesitate any longer! Hesitation will only harm the Church and lead to a dead end. We Chinese clergy and Chinese Catholics must unite and promote this patriotic, Church-loving, and anti-imperialist reform movement, promote our holy religion, and shine brightly in our free land.

　　Finally, on behalf of the Tianjin Catholic Church Reform Movement Promotion Association, I would like to thank all the citizens of Tianjin and the people of the whole country, as well as the People's Government, for their support. And I guarantee that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we will support the Common Program and abide by all the policies, laws, and measures of the government, and complete this great task of anti-imperialist, patriotic, and Church-loving reform with practical actions.

### 吴克斋的开幕词

专栏：

　　吴克斋的开幕词诸位首长、来宾，诸位神长教友：
    今天我们很荣幸，能够有这样的机会，邀请诸位首长和教内教外的人士来参加我们天津市天主教革新运动促进会的成立大会。的确这是天津天主教的空前盛举，表示我们天津天主教徒决心把帝国主义的毒素彻底从教会中洗刷出去，使广大的天主教徒向人民靠拢，并且随着我们祖国的壮大而站立起来。
    大家知道，我们的国家近百年来一直受着帝国主义的侵略。同时天主教传入中国以来，被帝国主义者做为侵略的工具，这是不可否认的事实。历史上有多少次侵华战争都是以教案为借口。一连串不平等条约里都载着在华“传教特权”，目的就是以传教做掩护来进行侵略我国的阴谋。
    我们天主教信友决心要本着反帝爱国爱教的精神跟全国人民一同站起来，坚决地洗掉天主教过去的污点，坚决地与帝国主义割断一切关系，实行自治、自养、自传（以下简称三自），决不受帝国主义的任何利用。帝国主义分子们对我们的爱国运动进行了卑鄙的阻挠，从事造谣、破坏、分化，使爱国爱教的人士遇到了很多的困难；然而我们相信有力量、有信心来克服它。截至现在，在革新的宣言上签名的神长教友们，已有一万五千余名，这种事实证明了帝国主义分子们的阴谋已经彻底失败了。
    但是帝国主义分子是死不甘心的，他们还在继续进行破坏；我们要提高警惕，团结一致，与帝国主义分子坚决斗争，争取革新运动的彻底胜利。
    关于革新运动基本精神，已在宣言上载明，本人不再重复。仅在此再提出两点意见：
    第一：我们的革新运动今天只能说是走了第一步。几百年来帝国主义利用教会对我国进行侵略的罪行，我们还没有清算。我们必须尽量揭露帝国主义所加于宗教的罪恶，只有这样，我们才能教育过去受了欺骗、受了麻醉的教友，真正认识帝国主义的丑恶；只有这样才能洗刷天主教的污点，恢复天主教的纯洁。西开的教友、望海楼的教友最近都已经开过不少控诉会，这是非常好的。西开帝国主义分子文贵宾直到今天还在神甫楼里贴布告，污蔑我们的反帝爱国爱教三自运动；我们不能和他妥协。在我们三自运动刚开始时，他曾以下地狱、停止神功、是“魔鬼”、是叛徒等来威胁和阻挠我们。以后看没有什么效果，又承认签名的不是魔鬼，不下地狱了。今天他又在捏造我们要“图谋教会合法当局”了，要宣布“教宗给我们弃绝的惩罚”了。我们坚决反对这种滥用神权，曲解天主教义的帝国主义行为。
    第二：革新运动并不是排外，乃是要使天主教的主权掌握在中国神长的手里，而不受帝国主义的辖制，像世界上其他国家一样。因为今天我们中国是个强大的国家，我们中国天主教也要随着而强大起来了。但是帝国主义分子说：这是“犯上”、“叛教”。教友们！我们信的是“教”，而不是信的“人”，我们信的是“耶稣基督的福音”，而不是信的“帝国主义分子的命令”。有些人还在给帝国主义分子作掩护，说他们是“超国际”、“超政治”的；但是我们现在觉悟了，他们除了在这种烟幕下进行破坏活动外，他们说的话那一句不是欺骗我们忘掉了祖国呢！例如最近破获的美国间谍雷振远神甫在华北教区五省三市组织的公教报国团庞大的间谍特务组织，罗致了很多位神甫和教友做特务活动。前天政府又接受津沽大学师生和天主教徒的要求，逮捕了美国间谍卜相贤、鲍翊华、房如晦三人。他们披着宗教的外衣，干的却是间谍的勾当。若不是现在政府贤明，不但会发生“教案”，恐怕天主教在中国也就不用传了！现在全国各地区的革新运动，都已起来了，这证明了全国绝大多数的教友们有着爱国反帝的共同目标，同样地认识到我们中国的天主教再也不能忍受帝国主义分子的压迫、愚弄和利用了，要割断与他们的任何联系。每个有信德的教友，应当有决心。全国各地的神长、教友们，赶快行动起来吧！不要再迟疑了！迟疑的只是害了教，是走向一条死路。我们中国神长、中国教友们，必须一致团结起来推动这个爱国爱教反帝的革新运动，广扬我们的圣教，在我们的自由国土上大放光明。
    最后本人愿代表天津市天主教革新运动促进会来感谢全体天津市民和全国人民以及人民政府对我们的支援。并保证在毛主席英明领导下，拥护共同纲领遵守政府一切的政策、法令及措施，以实际行动来完成这一反帝爱国爱教伟大的革新任务。
