The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government
	Decision on State-Owned Industrial Production and Construction in 1951
	(Approved at the 79th Meeting of the Government Administration Council on April 6, 1951)
	(1) Approve the state-owned industrial production control figures for 1951 set by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, and instruct the central industrial ministries and the industrial departments of the major administrative regions to allocate these figures to their respective enterprises. Starting with the grassroots enterprises, specific plans for production, cost, labor, and other items for this year should be compiled from the bottom up, reviewed and summarized at each level, and submitted by the central industrial ministries for review by May 31, and then comprehensively submitted to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council for approval.
	In order to ensure the completion and exceeding of this year's production plans and to develop future industrial production, all industrial and trade departments must adopt a developmental perspective, integrating supply, production, and sales, and develop production through the development of supply and sales, opposing conservatism and reducing blindness. Therefore, in terms of supply: efforts should be made to increase the output of industrial raw material crops (cotton, hemp, tobacco, sugar, hides, wool, etc.) and various raw materials and semi-finished products, encourage conservation, reward the creation of substitutes, carefully clean up warehouse storage, and rationally allocate and utilize them; in terms of production: existing equipment capacity should be maximized, old production standards should be broken, output should be increased, quality should be improved, and varieties should be expanded; in terms of sales: the growth of people's purchasing power should be fully estimated, price policies should be correctly grasped, public and private commercial forces should be organized, and sales channels should be actively opened to ensure the balanced development of supply, production, and sales.
	Production control figures are not passive limits, but an active goal to strive for; all industrial departments should pay close attention to the comprehensive situation of supply, production, and sales; if it is necessary to change the production volume of a certain product, it should be reported to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council for timely verification and modification, in order to promote the development of industrial production.
	(2) Approve the state-owned industrial investment control figures for 1951 set by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, and instruct the central industrial departments to formulate specific plans for capital construction, and submit them to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council in two batches before May 15 and June 15. In order to ensure the realization of the capital construction plan, the capital construction project must implement an economic accounting system, and must comply with the capital construction procedures stipulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, establish a responsibility system, promote a contract system, ensure quality, avoid waste, and complete the plan on time.
	(3) State-owned local industries play an important role in developing the national economy, and a positive development policy must be adopted to encourage the enthusiasm of local governments at all levels in operating industries. The business direction of state-owned local industries is:
	(1) Facing the countryside and solving the lack of living and production materials for the vast number of farmers;
	(2) Processing for national enterprises and becoming a capable assistant to national enterprises;
	(3) Mainly using local raw materials;
	(4) Small and medium-sized industries that can be handled by local resources and manpower, especially light industries that produce civilian goods.
	Before the Central People's Government has formulated an overall plan including local industries, the production and basic construction plans of local industries should be reviewed at each level and decided by the financial and economic committees of the major administrative regions, and important ones should be reported to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council for approval; general plans should be reported to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council and the relevant central industrial departments for the record.
	The business scope of local industries:
	(1) Independent power plants not within the transmission network;
	(2) Operation of small mines (small mining areas);
	(3) Iron factories manufacturing agricultural tools and small hardware;
	(4) Building material industries (such as brick kilns, sawmills, etc.);
	(5) Textile and knitting factories;
	(6) Civilian bedding industry;
	(7) Food industry needed by the local area;
	(8) Paper mills and printing stationery industry;
	(9) Chemical industry manufacturing daily necessities;
	(10) Local public utilities and other light industries needed by the local area but difficult for the central government to prepare.
	The development of local industries should rely on local self-accumulation of funds. The financial and economic departments of the Central People's Government will provide the following assistance to local industries under possible conditions:
	(1) Surplus national production equipment can be allocated for local construction industries according to local basic construction plans, and local governments will pay depreciation fees to the state annually, or it will be used as state investment in local industries;
	(2) The central competent industrial departments provide technical guidance and assistance to local industries;
	(3) Trade departments and banks should support local industries within the scope of possibility;
	(4) The profits of local industries are exempt from the task of handing over to the state treasury within a certain period to meet the needs of local industrial expansion and reproduction;
	(5) Establish a leadership system for local industries to strengthen the leadership of local industrial policies and guidelines and assistance in business management.
	(4) Strengthening industrial operation and management and implementing economic accounting is the basic principle for managing people's enterprises. The purpose of economic accounting is to promote the enthusiasm of each enterprise in operation under the centralized guidance of the national plan, improve labor productivity, increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, eliminate waste and increase national accumulation, and ensure the expansion and reproduction of industry and improve the material life and cultural level of workers.
	The state implements the management of economic accounting for state-owned enterprises through the following five methods:
	(1) Implement planned management, that is, stipulate the tasks of enterprises to increase production (quantity, quality and variety), improve labor productivity and reduce costs, and establish a systematic inspection system to promote its realization.
	(2) Determine the necessary fixed assets and working capital for each enterprise. For enterprises that have not determined their capital, they should immediately seriously clean up their assets and determine their capital. If there is any surplus or deficiency, the state will uniformly allocate it.
	(3) Implement an independent accounting system, whereby the People's Bank of China centralizes all credit of state-owned enterprises, allowing each enterprise to have the right to independently conduct transactions with state banks, and gradually exert the supervisory role of banks over the financial activities of enterprises. The leaders of each enterprise are responsible for the profits and losses of the enterprises under their management.
	(4) Under the condition of completing the national balance plan, enterprises have the right to independently sell products and purchase raw materials through a contract system.
	(5) Implement a factory bonus fund system. All enterprises that have determined their capital and can carry out production in a planned manner can extract a certain percentage (not more than 30%) from the surplus profits, after the initial foundation of the economic accounting system has been laid, to serve as the factory bonus fund, which will be implemented by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council.
	All state-owned enterprises that have not yet started to implement economic accounting must do the following necessary work this year in order to lay the initial foundation for establishing an economic accounting system:
	(1) According to the plan forms promulgated by the Government Administration Council, prepare specific plans for production, labor, material supply, cost, finance, etc.
	(2) According to the asset cleaning method stipulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, clean up the assets and determine the capital.
	(3) On the basis of carrying out production competitions and anti-waste campaigns, formulate reasonable and feasible average advanced quotas; first of all, determine quality, quantity, material and work.
	(4) After a major security inspection, establish a security system and a regular inspection and maintenance system.
	(5) Establish a main responsibility system, starting with the most important and weakest links in the enterprise.
	(6) Establish and improve the management system of financial costs.
	(7) According to the periodic reporting system stipulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, strengthen statistical institutions at all levels, improve the grassroots recording system, and improve statistical work.
	For factories and mines where the economic accounting system has an initial foundation (such as the Northeast), this year should be improved to focus on the following tasks:
	(1) Strengthen workshop work, implement workshop cost management, and implement the economic accounting system to the workshop;
	(2) Improve capital management, organize the production process and supply and sales process more rationally, and accelerate the turnover of capital;
	(3) Strengthen technical management, formulate more practical operating procedures and technical standards, and establish independent and authoritative inspection work;
	(4) Gradually promote the piece-rate wage system.
	In order for enterprises to do a good job in operation and management and economic accounting, they must establish a master's labor attitude of all employees and give full play to their labor enthusiasm, wisdom and perseverance. Therefore, enterprise managers must adhere to the position of the working class, implement the idea of ​​democratic management, and resolutely implement:
	(1) Consult with leading cadres in all aspects frequently and be good at using the factory management committee to form a leading core.
	(2) All matters related to the masses of employees must be passed through the masses, with the consent and support of the masses, and become the conscious actions of the masses.
	(3) The implementation of the Trade Union Law should be implemented administratively. The trade union is the leader and organizer of the masses. All things that need to be done through the masses should be carried out through the trade union.
	(4) Regarding employee welfare, the labor insurance regulations should be implemented to improve security and health work.
	In order to improve the enthusiasm of industrial departments at all levels to improve operation and management, it is stipulated that the surplus profits of state-owned industries in the next two years will be controlled by the central industrial departments and the industrial departments of the major administrative regions; the scope of their use will be separately stipulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council.
	(5) Production competition in enterprises marks the improvement of the political awareness of the working class and the establishment of a new labor attitude. Production competition is a process of development from a rush to a regular, from improving labor intensity to combining labor and technology, and is combined with the development of operation and management in factories and mines. The responsibility of leadership lies in earnestly grasping the laws of movement, actively guiding the competition in the direction of regularity, and in the direction of giving full play to the wisdom of the working class and learning and mastering technology. To this end, attention should be paid to:
	(1) The content of the competition must be combined with the overall task of completing the production plan, combined with solving the current weakest or most critical link in production, and clarify the competition goals in each stage and in each factory and mine, avoiding generality and blindness.
	(2) Advocate the combination of labor and technology, enlighten the wisdom of employees, and improve production by improving tools, improving operating methods, and improving labor organization. Prevent the tendency of simply increasing labor intensity, pursuing quantity, and neglecting quality.
	(3) Promoting the experience of advanced producers and advanced production teams is a way to carry out production competition.
	(4) Establish and improve various business management systems in the competition, create new technical standards and quotas, and promote contact contracts and collective contracts, so that employees and various production departments can seek balanced development of mutual cooperation and mutual unity.
	(5) Establish a reasonable reward system in the competition.
	Production competition is a major event related to the overall work of a factory and mine. It must be planned and arranged uniformly by the factory management committee, with division of labor and cooperation. The trade union should be responsible for mobilizing and organizing employees to implement the competition; The administrative side must promptly put forward production plans and current central tasks, and be responsible for the supply of raw materials and the inspection of product specifications, etc., cooperate with each other to ensure the smooth progress of the competition.

    （五）企业中的生产竞赛，标志着工人阶级政治觉悟的提高与新的劳动态度的建立。生产竞赛是由突击到经常，由提高劳动强度到劳动与技术相结合的发展过程，是与工矿中的经营管理的发展相结合的。领导的责任，在于切实掌握运动的规律，积极引导竞赛向经常性的方向发展，向发挥工人阶级的智慧、学习与掌握技术的方向发展。为此，应注意：
    （１）竞赛的内容必须与完成生产计划的总任务相结合，与解决生产中当前最薄弱的或最关键的一环相结合，明确每一阶段、每一厂矿中的竞赛目标，避免一般性与盲目性。
    （２）提倡劳动与技术相结合，启发职工的智慧，从改善工具、改善操作方法、改善劳动组织来提高生产。防止单纯加强劳动强度，追逐数量，忽视质量的偏向。
    （３）推广先进生产者与先进生产小组的经验，是开展生产竞赛的方式。
    （４）在竞赛中建立与改善各种经营管理制度，创造新的技术标准与定额，提倡联系合同与集体合同，使职工之间、各生产部门之间，求得相互配合、相互团结的平衡发展。
    （５）在竞赛中建立合理的奖励制度。
    生产竞赛是关系于一个厂、矿全面工作的大事，必须经过工厂管理委员会的统一计划与布置，分工合作，而动员与组织职工群众实行竞赛，则应由工会负责；行政方面，则必须及时提出生产计划与当前的中心任务，并负责原材料的供应与产品规格的检验等，互相配合，保证竞赛的顺利进行。
