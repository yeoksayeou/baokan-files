　　CPC Wuxi County Committee Convened a Farmers' Representative Assembly to Announce the Results of the Handling of the Xu Dong Issue

To the Editors of the People's Daily:

After reading the short commentary in the People's Daily on March 16th entitled "Party Members Who Undermine Land Reform Must Be Severely Punished," we immediately convened a county committee meeting to discuss and examine the matter. We believe that the People's Daily's criticism of our handling of the issue of the evil landlord Xu Juchu, father of Xu Dong, is entirely correct. After the land reform began, when the district committee reflected the opinions of the masses requesting the arrest of Xu Juchu, we did not promptly arrest him according to the law because we did not sufficiently recognize the counter-revolutionary essence of Xu Juchu, who had consistently murdered, robbed, and opposed the people, and we did not adequately study the spirit of the Party and the People's Government's repeated instructions on actively arresting evil landlords and resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionary activities. Even after the district committee sent the county committee specific materials on the masses' accusations of Xu Juchu's crimes, and after investigation confirmed them, we arrested him on November 13th, but then hesitated for another two months on whether to sentence him to death, failing to promptly and severely punish him according to the laws of the People's Government and the opinions of the people. The death penalty was not carried out until January 30, 1951. This is a concrete manifestation of our insufficient implementation of the Party's policies and our lack of responsibility to the people. We should be criticized by the people, admit our mistakes to the people, and guarantee that similar mistakes will not occur in the future.

Our mistake in handling the case of the evil landlord Xu Juchu was mainly due to our unclear class stance and lack of principle. We did not steadfastly proceed from the interests of the people but instead considered the feelings of Xu Dong, mistakenly believing that Xu Juchu's son, Xu Dong, was the head of the organization section of the Nanjing branch of the East China People's Revolutionary University and a veteran cadre. Therefore, after Xu Juchu was arrested, Xu Dong wrote several letters defending his father and slandering the just actions of the masses. Furthermore, when Xu Dong came to the county committee twice to defend his father's crimes, the county committee did not adopt a serious attitude, adhere to principles, or take a correct stance to sternly criticize Xu Dong's mistakes. Instead, we yielded to Xu Dong's unreasonable demands, allowing Xu Dong to illegally extract his criminal father from prison to talk in the county committee office. We also agreed to Xu Dong going to the countryside to participate in mass meetings and speak publicly, suppressing the mass movement,打击打击 the fighting spirit of the masses, seriously hindering the land reform in the township, and fueling the counter-revolutionary arrogance of the evil landlords, which aroused great dissatisfaction among the people. This shows our lack of deep understanding of the great historical significance of implementing land reform and eliminating the feudal system. At the same time, our failure to promptly report Xu Dong's erroneous behavior to higher authorities and forward it to the Nanjing Municipal Committee also demonstrates a lack of organizational discipline.

In order to salvage the Party's prestige among the people, we have decided to send comrades from the county committee to convene a farmers' representative assembly in the locality to admit our mistakes to the masses and announce the Nanjing Municipal Committee's decision to expel Xu Dong from the Party and the Wuxi County People's Court's sentence of Xu Dong to imprisonment.

We believe that our mistake in handling the issue of the evil landlord Xu Juchu is serious. In addition to requesting that the higher-level Party committee give us the appropriate punishment, we also request that this self-criticism be published publicly in the People's Daily.

### 中共无锡县委召开农民代表大会  宣布徐栋问题处理结果

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　中共无锡县委召开农民代表大会
　  宣布徐栋问题处理结果人民日报编辑部：
    我们看到了人民日报三月十六日以《破坏土地改革的党员必须受到最严重的处分》为题的短评后，立即召开了县委会议，进行了讨论和检查。我们认为人民日报对我们在处理徐栋之父恶霸徐菊初问题上的批评是完全正确的。土地改革开始后，当地区委反映群众意见要求逮捕徐菊初，由于我们对徐菊初一贯杀人越货与人民为敌反革命的本质认识不足，和对党与人民政府历次关于主动逮捕恶霸和坚决镇压反革命活动的指示的精神研究不够，因而没有及时依法逮捕。及至当地区委将群众控诉徐菊初的具体罪恶材料送到县委，经调查属实于十一月十三日予以逮捕后，对是否应判死刑犹豫不决又达两月，未能按照人民政府法令，根据人民意见，迅速严厉惩治。直至一九五一年一月三十日才执行死刑。这是我们贯彻党的政策与对人民负责精神不够的一种具体表现，应该受到人民的指责，向人民承认错误，并保证今后不再发生类似错误。我们在处理恶霸徐菊初案件上所犯的错误，主要是由于阶级立场不明确，原则性不强，没有坚定地从人民群众利益出发，而照顾了徐栋的情绪，错误的认为徐菊初之子徐栋是华东人民革命大学南京分校的组织处长，是老干部。因而当逮捕徐菊初后，徐栋数次来信为其父辩护，污蔑群众的正义行动，及徐栋两次来县委为其父的罪行申辩时，县委均未采取严肃的态度，坚持原则，站在正确的立场，严正的批评徐栋的错误；反而迁就了徐栋的无理要求，允许徐栋违法地从狱中提取他犯罪的父亲到县委办公室里谈话，并同意徐栋下乡参加群众会议，公开讲话，压制了群众运动，打击了群众斗争情绪，严重地阻碍了该乡土地改革的进行，助长了恶霸地主的反革命活动气焰，招致了人民极大的不满。这是我们对实行土地改革、消灭封建制度的伟大历史意义缺乏深刻的认识，同时我们没有把徐栋的错误行为及时报告上级转告南京市委，又表现了缺乏组织性纪律性。为了挽救党在人民群众中的威信，我们决定派县委同志至当地召开农民代表大会，向人民群众承认我们的错误，并宣布南京市委开除徐栋党籍的决定和无锡县人民法院判处徐栋徒刑的判决书。我们认为我们在处理恶霸徐菊初问题的错误是严重的，除请求上级党委给予应得之处分外，并要求将此项检讨在人民日报上予以公开发表。
