Hebei Sends Large Number of Cadres to the Countryside
　　Inspect Cotton Planting Preparations
　　Chairman Yang Xiufeng Personally Inspects Cotton-Producing Areas Such as Xingtai and Handan

　　People's governments at all levels in Hebei Province have dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into the countryside to inspect the preparations for cotton planting. Chairman Yang Xiufeng of the Provincial People's Government also personally went to cotton-producing areas such as Xingtai and Handan to conduct inspections.

　　In general, the preparation work for cotton planting in various parts of Hebei Province started relatively early. Last winter, a large-scale fertilizer accumulation campaign was carried out throughout the province, resulting in more fertilizer being applied to cotton fields throughout the province this year than last year. Various regions and counties have also trained a large number of cotton planting technicians to specifically guide or help farmers improve cotton planting techniques. In addition, local cotton farmers have made good preparations for agricultural tools and seeds needed for cotton planting. Moreover, cotton fields in various places generally had a bumper harvest last year, and cotton farmers are highly enthusiastic about planting cotton. These are all favorable conditions for increasing cotton production in Hebei Province this year.

　　However, many local cadres, satisfied with the above achievements, have relaxed their leadership in cotton planting work, neglecting to address farmers' ideological concerns and practical difficulties regarding increasing cotton production. Cadres in some areas have also failed to mobilize and help farmers formulate cotton planting plans. As a result, cotton planting work in some villages has fallen into a state of laissez-faire, and the cotton planting preparations in some villages have not yet met the requirements of the original plan. According to a survey of eighty-six villages in Ding County and Jin County, only 20 percent of the villages have cadres who have thoroughly publicized the people's government's cotton planting policies, and the masses have generally made household cotton planting plans, able to complete or exceed the cotton planting figures required by the people's government. Another 47 percent of the villages have only generally formulated plans and need to strengthen leadership to complete the task. In more than 32 percent of the villages, cadres have relaxed their leadership in cotton planting work, and the number of cotton planting planned by farmers is still far from the requirements. Farmers in some areas still have ideological concerns such as fear of insect pests and fear of cotton prices falling.

　　Upon discovering the above problems, people's governments at all levels in Hebei Province immediately decided to send a large number of cadres to go deep into the countryside to inspect cotton planting work and publicize cotton planting policies to farmers to dispel their cotton planting concerns and difficulties. Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, personally went to Handan Prefecture at the end of last month to conduct inspections. Various departments of the Provincial People's Government have also recently dispatched more than ninety cadres to form an inspection team, led by Zhang Jiguang, Director of the Agricultural Department, and Li Jihuan, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, to go to various counties for inspection. The leading organs of various prefectures and most counties in the province have also organized inspection teams to go to the countryside for inspection.

### 河北大批干部下乡  检查植棉准备工作  杨秀峰主席亲赴邢台邯郸等产棉区检查

　　河北大批干部下乡
　  检查植棉准备工作
　  杨秀峰主席亲赴邢台邯郸等产棉区检查
    河北省各级人民政府已抽调大批干部深入农村，检查植棉的准备工作。省人民政府杨秀峰主席亦亲自到邢台、邯郸等棉产区进行检查。
    河北省各地的植棉准备工作，一般开始得较早。去年冬季，全省曾进行大规模的积肥运动，使今年全省棉田所施肥料普遍较去年增多；各专区及县又训练了大批的植棉技术人员，以便具体地指导或帮助农民改进植棉技术。其他如植棉所需的农具、种籽等，各地棉农也曾进行了很好的准备；加之，去年各地棉田普遍丰收，棉农植棉情绪都很高。这些都是河北省今年增产棉花的有利条件。
    但是，有不少地方干部由于满足于以上已有的成绩，因而放松了植棉工作的领导，忽视解决农民对增产棉花的思想顾虑和实际困难。有的地区干部更不注意动员和帮助农民制订植棉计划。因此，部分村庄的植棉工作陷于自流现象，有的村庄的植棉准备工作至今尚未达到原定计划的要求。据定县和晋县八十六个村的调查，仅有百分之二十的村庄，干部宣传人民政府植棉政策比较深入，群众普遍作了户的植棉计划，能完成或超过人民政府要求植棉数字；另有百分之四十七的村庄只一般地制订了计划，须加强领导才能完成任务；还有百分之三十二以上的村庄，干部放松领导植棉工作，农民计划植棉的数字距要求尚远。有些地区的农民还存在着怕虫害、怕棉花落价等思想顾虑。
    河北省各级人民政府发现了上述问题，立即决定派遣大批干部深入农村，检查植棉工作，并向农民宣传植棉政策，以解除农民的植棉顾虑和困难。省人民政府主席杨秀峰已于上月底亲赴邯郸专区检查。省人民政府的各部门近亦抽调干部九十多人组成检查团，由农业厅张纪光厅长、民政厅李济寰厅长等率领，分赴各县进行检查。该省各专区及大部分县的领导机关也纷纷组织了检查团下乡检查。
