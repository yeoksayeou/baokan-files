　　Hebei Launches Material Exchange Between Cooperatives
　  Using Stalled Local Products to Exchange for Essential Production Goods
To the Editor:
    In order to carry out the work of material exchange within the cooperative system, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative convened a meeting of responsible cadres from supply and marketing cooperatives in various special districts in late February. Through this meeting, thirty-five agreements and contracts were signed, covering thirty-four kinds of commodities, with a total sales volume of more than 13.8 billion yuan.
    Most of these commodities were slow-selling products. For example, the Tongxian Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative sold 78,500 pieces of stone slabs that had been stagnant for a long time, and 340,000 jin of lime. Other items such as sacks and pesticides were exchanged for much-needed white hemp, cottonseed, rice seeds, porcelain, and chili peppers (slow-selling goods from Handan Special District), which strongly supported the spring plowing production of cooperative members.
    In order to ensure the execution of the contracts, both parties clearly stipulated in the contracts that: those who violate the contracts shall compensate the other party with 10% of the total value of the goods, and shall be subject to due punishment according to the severity of the circumstances. I would like to share a few experiences from this contract signing with everyone:
    First, we made full preparations before the meeting. In particular, we seized the opportunity of the spring plowing season, when farmers needed to offer slow-selling products in exchange for seeds and other essential items for production. This played a great role in promoting and ensuring spring plowing work.
    Second, the person in charge of signing the contract should fully grasp the specifications, quality, quantity, transportation losses, delivery location and time, etc. of the products, and then carefully calculate before a contract can be established.
    Third, it is necessary to grasp the principle of mutual benefit for both the buyer and the seller, and at the same time adopt the policy of small profits and quick turnover.

### 河北展开合作社间物资交流  推出滞销土产换回生产必需品

　　河北展开合作社间物资交流
　  推出滞销土产换回生产必需品编辑同志：
    河北省供销合作总社为开展合作社系统内部物资交流的工作，在二月下旬召开了各专区供销社负责干部会议。通过这次会议订立了三十五件协议合同，计包括三十四种商品，总推销额为一百三十八亿多元。
    在这批商品中，大部是属于滞销产品。如通县专区供销合作总社销出了滞销很久的石板七万八千五百块，石灰三十四万斤，其他如麻袋、农药等物品，换回了自己需要的白麻、棉籽、稻种、磁货、辣椒（邯郸专区的滞销货）等货，有力地支持了社员的春耕生产。
    为了保证合同的执行，双方在合同内明文规定了：违犯合同者，除以商品总值金额的百分之十赔偿对方外，并应依情节的轻重受到应得的处分。我想把这次签订合同的几点经验告诉给大家：
    第一，在会议召开之前，我们做了充分的准备工作。特别是抓住了春耕时期，农民需要推出滞销产品换回籽种等生产上需用物品。这对春耕工作起了很大的推动和保证作用。
    第二，签订合同的负责人，应该充分掌握产品的规格、质量、数量、运输中的损耗量，交货地点时间等情况，然后经过精打细算，才能成立合同。
    第三，要掌握买卖双方两利的原则。同时以薄利多销为方针。
        河北省供销合作总社
