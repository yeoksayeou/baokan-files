Patriotic Content in Chinese Textbooks
    A Response to Mr. Jiang Shanye
    People's Education Publishing House

On March 22nd, the People's Daily published an article by Mr. Jiang Shanye on its third page, titled "Strengthening Patriotic Content in Chinese Language Classes," which criticized the middle school Chinese textbooks published by the People's Education Publishing House (including the five volumes for junior high and the six volumes for senior high). We welcome and value this criticism. After reading Mr. Jiang Shanye's article and discussing it, we feel that some of his criticisms are accurate and should be accepted, while others seem to view the issue of how to strengthen patriotic content too mechanically and narrowly, and require some explanation.

First of all, we acknowledge that Mr. Jiang's principle that Chinese language classes must strengthen patriotic content is entirely correct. We also agree with his suggestion that patriotic content should include heroic figures and their creations in the history of the motherland, the cultural heritage of the motherland, especially its literary heritage, the natural beauty of the motherland, and articles praising new people and new things in the motherland. Moreover, our editorial work has been planned and carried out with this intention. However, intention is just a predetermined goal; to concretely realize this intention, we must consider some related issues. What are the goals of Chinese language education, how should the selected teaching materials coordinate with these goals, what is the relationship between the subject matter and the theme of the teaching materials, and how should the literary heritage be received at the middle school stage? Only by clarifying these issues can we achieve the original intention.

The main goal of Chinese language education is to cultivate students' ability to understand, master, and apply the rules of the mother tongue. In the case of the Chinese language subject, patriotic education must be carried out through Chinese language education. It is unimaginable for the Chinese language subject to engage in empty talk about patriotic education without engaging in Chinese language education. Patriotic education can also be carried out through history, geography, political science, and other social sciences, as well as through natural sciences. In the task of conducting patriotic education, each subject should "specialize" according to its own nature, and each should undertake its own specific tasks. The Chinese language subject is by no means a "synthesis" of other subjects. A Chinese language textbook must be a "Chinese language" textbook. It is inappropriate to select some patriotic teaching materials from history, geography, political science, and other subjects and piece them together to form a Chinese language textbook.

Therefore, the patriotic teaching materials for the Chinese language subject must be "carefully selected from many articles that express this theme, on the one hand seeking their content to be substantial, with flesh and blood, and the development of thought to be correct and precise, and on the other hand seeking their writing to be consistent with spoken language, truthful and vivid" (Editorial Intent of Junior High Chinese Language Textbooks); at the same time, "attention should be paid to suitability for students' level, so that they can understand and digest them" (ibid.). Only such teaching materials can accomplish the task of Chinese language education, and thereby accomplish the task of patriotic education. As Mr. Jiang said, there are many articles that sing the praises of heroic figures in history, articles that sing the praises of the motherland's natural beauty, and articles that sing the praises of "the beginning of this great historical era and the victory of the Chinese people" in the new China. However, according to the selection criteria mentioned earlier, choosing teaching materials suitable for a certain grade in senior high or junior high school from those articles, and that are also Chinese language teaching materials, inevitably requires much deliberation. The selection of Chinese language teaching materials must strictly adhere to certain standards. Chinese language textbooks and "Collections of Patriotic Essays" and "Collections of Historical Stories" should be two completely different types of things.

Since selecting materials is not easy, can the editors write them themselves according to their needs? Writing a few such articles may be possible, but generally speaking, it is not. The role of middle school Chinese language textbooks is to enable students to read examples of various articles. The so-called examples refer not only to different genres, but also to different styles. If written by only a few people, the style will certainly not be diverse. It is inappropriate for students to always read articles written by only a few people. The materials for Chinese language textbooks must be "selected," and must be "selected" from many books, newspapers, and magazines according to standards. Due to our limited academic ability and experience, the scope of our material selection is not broad enough, the materials we have selected are not numerous enough, and the decisions we have made are not refined enough, resulting in many shortcomings in the Chinese language textbooks. We are willing to work hard to correct these shortcomings. We earnestly hope that Mr. Jiang and Chinese language teachers across the country will help us and inform us of articles that meet the selection criteria at any time.

The theme is expressed through the subject matter. The theme of patriotism can be expressed through a variety of subjects. When teaching the Chinese language subject, it is necessary to analyze the subject matter and study what theme it expresses. Such analysis and research is an important item in the teaching process of the Chinese language subject. If this item is ignored and the theme cannot be discovered from the subject matter, then it is a failure of teaching. Mr. Jiang said: "The spirit of loving the motherland should run through the entire textbook like a red thread." Running this "red thread" is something that should be paid attention to in the editing of the textbook; however, discovering this "red thread" is something that should be paid attention to in the teaching process.

Singing the praises of our great leader Chairman Mao is a theme. Mr. Jiang believes that there are only two articles in the junior high Chinese language textbooks related to this theme: "Chairman Mao and the Workers" and "Chairman Mao Zedong's Youth," and another article is about "Chairman Mao's Words." In fact, there are more than just these two articles related to this theme. Let's take one article as an example. Lesson 9 of the fourth volume is "The First Harvest" written by Shu Wei, which describes the gratitude, love, and respect of the emancipated peasants for Chairman Mao, which is very moving to read. Although this article does not use Chairman Mao's words and deeds as its subject matter, it does write about the lives of the emancipated peasants, from which it draws out the working people's love for Chairman Mao. It is necessary to analyze and study this when teaching, and it is not possible to judge that this article is unrelated to the theme of singing the praises of our great leader only based on its subject matter, especially not only based on its title. In his article, Mr. Jiang identified and listed several themes of patriotic education solely based on the subject matter and titles of the lessons, and then added the conclusions "small in number," "only a few," and "only a few," which is not a very appropriate superficial and mechanical view. We once received a letter from a teacher at the Second Affiliated Middle School of the Normal University, criticizing the fourth volume of the junior high Chinese language textbook, saying that there were too few patriotic materials in that volume, with only one article, Lesson 4, "New Patriotism." That teacher's view is similar to Mr. Jiang's. Here, we would like to raise the issue of theme and subject matter for teachers to consider.

The content of patriotism is extremely broad. The "elimination of feudal, comprador, and fascist ideologies" and the "development of ideas that serve the people" as stipulated in the Common Program's cultural and educational policies, and the public morality of "advocating love for the motherland, love for the people, love for labor, love for science, and care for public property," are all content of patriotism and should be the guiding principles for compiling and selecting Chinese language teaching materials. We have taken this into consideration when compiling this set of textbooks and have tried our best to collect various articles that express these thematic ideas. Our understanding is that patriotism is a general topic, and these are sub-topics under the general topic. It is inappropriate to separate it because it is a sub-topic and not a general topic, and to think that it is unrelated to patriotism.

Our country's literary heritage of several thousand years is too rich. How to introduce it concisely to middle school students is an important issue. We have not handled this issue well and should review it. Thank you, Mr. Jiang, for raising this issue. We must study it in depth and handle it better. The language used in most of the works in our country's literary heritage is very different from the language we use today (even for vernacular works, there is a distance between ancient vernacular and modern spoken language, and it takes a lot of effort to choose them, and once they are selected, detailed annotations must be made), which is the main factor hindering us from freely selecting ancient literary works. It is a generally accepted principle not to learn classical Chinese in junior high school. It is difficult to select ancient works for junior high Chinese language textbooks. Some classical Chinese is starting to be learned in senior high school. Since it is just beginning, what is learned must be very simple. When selecting materials, in order to take into account the level of learning, there must be some restrictions. "We have so many great poets in our history, who have created so many beautiful poems," that's right. The problem is how to select some chapters that students can understand and appreciate with their beginner's ability to learn classical Chinese, and compile them into textbooks. We have seen literature readers in Soviet schools and middle schools in our country that are equivalent to those grades. Those readers selected Pushkin, Chekhov, Turgenev, and Tolstoy. Our textbooks cannot do this, we have obstacles in language and writing.

This is a problem. How to solve it is worth studying. Mr. Jiang has proposed the methods of "retelling" and "introducing." We believe that retold articles cannot be regarded as literary works; introduction can only help appreciate literary works, and reading introductory articles is not the same as appreciating literary works. What is the appropriate way to solve this problem? We earnestly hope that comrades who study ancient literature in our country and middle school Chinese language teachers will study and discuss it together. - Mr. Jiang also raised the study of literary history. In the middle school stage, there used to be a subject of literary history, and textbooks of literary history were compiled. Students have not read many literary works, and only learn literary history in vain, and as a result, they only know a pile of nouns such as "Han Fu," "Tang Poetry," "Song Ci," "Yuan Qu," "Seven Scholars of Jian'an," and "Four Great Poets of the Early Tang Dynasty," and there are no other achievements. Mr. Jiang also proposed a "systematic introduction." This method has also been used in the past, and Commercial Press and China Book Company have both published senior high Chinese textbooks compiled according to the literary history system. If we compile and select again now, the viewpoint and position should certainly be changed, but that kind of "system" that lists the works of past dynasties like a historical museum is still questionable in terms of teaching effectiveness.

Our textbooks select more translated articles, and Mr. Jiang pointed out that this is a shortcoming. We have noticed this when editing, and others have also raised it. This should be corrected. We plan to select some other materials to replace some of the translated articles. Before the revision is completed, the original textbook will still have to be supplied for a period of time. We ask teachers to pay attention to the following points when teaching translated articles. First, the analysis and research must be linked to the situation in our country, and the mastery of the theme must be linked to ideological education. For example, Lesson 3 of the fourth volume of the junior high Chinese language textbook, "Lyonia and His Grandmother," is excerpted from Grossman's "The People Are Immortal." Although it writes about Soviet things, the theme of loving the motherland and hating the enemy can still have the effect of patriotic education if students analyze and understand it. Secondly, translated articles have many differences from our country's language habits in terms of vocabulary, syntax, and expression methods. These should be brought up for comparative study when teaching. Some can be absorbed to enrich our language materials. Some should be explained, and how it should be said according to our country's language habits. This kind of research is beneficial to students' language learning. Furthermore, we believe that the "articles about foreign things" pointed out by Mr. Jiang should be distinguished from translated articles. There is a certain purpose for selecting these articles, and we ask teachers to give students guidance when teaching. For example, the junior high Chinese language textbooks selected "Robertson," "Black People in America" (Volume 1), "The Naval Battle of Chumonchin," "In the Arctic," "In Yalta" (Volume 2), "The Happiest Man" (Volume 4), etc. If you don't just read the stories written, but also carefully understand the meaning of each article, then the effect of conducting ideological education through the Chinese language class will not be reduced because they are writing about foreign things.

Finally, let me briefly talk about the issues Mr. Jiang pointed out regarding the three teaching materials "A Visit to Yandang Mountain," "Breaking Ice on the Yellow River," and "Where Are the Masses?"

Mr. Jiang cited the last sentence of "A Visit to Yandang Mountain," "I see the four mountains clouded and rainy and gloomy, and I cannot but worry about tomorrow morning," and the poem by Xie Lingyun quoted in "Breaking Ice on the Yellow River," "The north wind is strong and sad," and believes that the use of the two words "worry" and "sad" "has a feeling of sadness." We cannot agree with this view. Seeing the clouds and rain gloomy, fearing that it will affect tomorrow morning's tour, is a positive emotion, and does not have a feeling of sadness. The "sad" in "The north wind is strong and sad" is not a sad meaning either, and you can understand it by reading the full text. "A Visit to Yandang Mountain" is excerpted from "Xu Xiake's Travels," and "Breaking Ice on the Yellow River" is excerpted from "The Travels of Lao Ts'an." These two books are famous literary works in our country, and excerpting these two articles is precisely to introduce these two books to students and let them "get a glimpse of the leopard." We cannot see the two words "worry" and "sad" and say that they "have a feeling of sadness," and we cannot regard these two articles as "vulgar and boring descriptive essays."

"Where Are the Masses?" was selected from the 29th issue of "China Youth." The editors had discussed it with the author, Comrade Wu Yikeng, and the author had revised it. The theme of this play is to criticize certain intellectuals who pay lip service to going deep into the masses and doing mass work, but after contacting the masses, when they encounter some specific facts that conflict with their own interests, they push away the masses and ignore the interests of the masses. The play has a very good effect on stage. Selecting it as a Chinese language teaching material can expose the shortcomings of intellectuals and achieve an educational effect. We have received many opinions on the Chinese language textbooks, but have not received any saying that this play is not suitable as a teaching material. Mr. Jiang believes that "it will have a bad effect," which is something we did not expect. We re-examined the play carefully and could not see that, as Mr. Jiang said, "it uses most of its space to describe the dirtiness of the peasants and the disgust of the young students." Mr. Jiang believes that this play "does not have enough positive portrayal of the peasants' diligence, bravery, and other excellent qualities." Our view is just the opposite. After reading this play, we have great respect for the peasant Yu Shuqing and do not have any feeling of "dirtiness" at all.

These are the different opinions from Mr. Jiang, and we would like to raise them for Mr. Jiang to give us guidance.

　　语文课本里的爱国主义内容
    答江山野先生
    人民教育出版社
    三月二十二日人民日报第三版登载江山野先生的一篇文章，题目叫《加强语文课的爱国主义内容》，是批评人民教育出版社出版的中学语文课本的（包括初中的五册，高中的六册）。我们很欢迎并且很重视这种批评。我们读了江山野先生的文章，经过讨论，觉得有些地方批评得很对，应该接受，有些地方似乎把怎么样加强爱国主义内容这个问题看得太机械了，太狭隘了，有说明一下的必要。
    首先我们承认江先生提出的语文课必须加强爱国主义的内容，这个原则是完全对的。爱国主义的内容应该包括祖国历史上的英雄人物及其创造，祖国的文化遗产，特别是文学遗产，祖国的大自然，歌颂祖国新人物、新事物的文章，这个意见，我们也同意。而且，我们的编辑工作就是按照这样的意图来计划来进行的。可是意图只是个预定的目标，要具体实现这个意图，必须考虑一些有关的问题。语文教育的目标是什么，选取的教材怎么样跟目标配合，教材的题材跟主题的关系怎么样，文学遗产在中学阶段怎么样接受，必须把这些问题都搞清楚了，才能够实现原来的意图。
    语文教育的目标主要是培养学生对于祖国语文规律的理解、掌握、运用的能力。爱国主义的教育，就语文科说，必须通过语文教育来进行。语文科离开了语文教育而空言爱国主义的教育，那是不能想像的。爱国主义的教育也可以通过历史科、地理科、政治科跟其他社会科学来进行，也可以通过自然科学来进行。在进行爱国主义教育的任务上，各学科各按本科的性质来“分工”，各自担任本科的特定的任务。语文科决非其他各科的“综合”。语文课本必须是“语文”课本。把历史科、地理科、政治科跟其他学科的有关爱国主义的教材选出一些来，拚凑成语文课本，那是不应该的。
    因此，语文科的爱国主义的教材要在表现这个主题的许多文章当中“审慎选择，一方面求其内容充实，有血有肉，思想的发展正确而且精密，一方面求其文字跟口语一致，真实而且生动”（初中语文课本编辑大意）；同时还要“注意到适合学生的程度，让他们领会得到，消化得了”（同上）。这样的教材才能够完成语文教育的任务，才能够从而完成爱国主义教育的任务。歌颂历史上英雄人物的文章，歌颂祖国大自然的文章，歌颂新中国“这一伟大历史时代的开端和中国人民的胜利”的文章，诚如江先生说的，数量很不少。可是，根据前面说的选材标准，要从那些文章选出适合高中或者初中某一年级程度的教材，而且是语文教材，就不免大费踌躇。语文教材的选择不能不严守一定的标准。语文课本跟《爱国主义文集》《历史故事集》该是完全不同的两类东西。
    选材既然不容易，是不是可以由编者按照需要自己来写呢？写这么几篇或者可以，一般的说可就不可以。中学语文课本的作用在使学生阅读各种文章的范例。所谓范例，不但指不同的体裁，也指不同的风格。由少数几个人来写，风格就决不能多种多样。让学生老是读少数几个人写的文章，那是不应该的。语文课本的材料必须“选”，必须依照标准从许多书籍、报纸、杂志里去“选”。我们限于学力和经验，选材的范围不够广，选出的材料不够多，去取的决定不够精当，致使语文课本有许多缺点。我们愿意努力改正这些缺点。我们热切地希望江先生和全国语文教师给我们帮助，遇见合乎选材标准的文章，随时告诉我们。
    主题是通过题材来表现的。表现爱国主义的主题，可以凭借多种多样的题材。语文科进行教学的时候，要就题材作分析，研究它表现的主题是什么。这样的分析研究是语文科教学过程中的重要项目。假如忽略了这个项目，不能就题材发掘主题，那就是教学的失败。江先生说：“要使爱祖国的精神像一条红线一样贯穿在整个课本之中。”贯穿这条“红线”是课本编辑上应该注意的；可是发掘这条“红线”是教学过程中应该注意的。
    歌颂我们伟大领袖毛主席，这是一个主题。江先生认为初中语文课本里有关这个主题的文章只有《毛主席和工人》跟《毛泽东同志的青年时代》两篇，另外有一篇是写《毛主席的话》的。其实，有关这个主题的决不止这两篇。随便举一篇来作例子。第四册第九课是束为写的《第一次收获》，写翻身农民对于毛主席的感激、热爱、崇敬，让人读了非常感动。这篇文章虽然没有用毛主席的言行做题材，可是写了翻身农民的生活，从这上头引出劳动人民对于毛主席的热爱。进行教学的时候就得加以分析研究，不能够光就它的题材，尤其不能够光就它的题目，就判定这篇文章跟歌颂我们伟大领袖的主题无关。江先生的文章里单从课文的题材和题目上来辨识，开列了几个爱国主义教育的主题，就加上“数量少”“只有几篇”“寥寥数篇”的断语，这种表面的机械的看法是不很妥当的。我们曾经接到师范大学附中二部一位教师的来信，对于初中语文课本第四册提出批评，说那一册里关于爱国主义的材料太少了，只有第四课《新爱国主义》一篇。那位教师的看法跟江先生相似。在这儿，我们愿意提出主题和题材的问题来，请求教师们考虑。
    爱国主义的内容是极其广泛的。共同纲领文化教育政策规定的“肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想”、“发展为人民服务的思想”，“提倡爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物”的公德，这些个都是爱国主义的内容，都是编选语文教材的时候应该依据的准绳。我们编辑这一套课本，曾经顾到这一点，尽可能搜集表现这些主题思想的各种各样的文章。我们的了解是：爱国主义是个总题，这些个就是总题下的子目。因为它是子目不是总题，就把它划开，认为跟爱国主义无关，这种狭隘的看法也是不很妥当的。
    我国几千年来的文学遗产太丰富了。怎么样扼要地介绍给中学生，这是个重要的问题。对于这个问题，我们没有处理得好，是应该检讨的。谢谢江先生提出这个意见，我们一定要深入地研究，更好地处理。我国文学遗产中大部分作品使用的语言跟今天我们使用的语言距离很大（即使是白话作品，古白话跟现代口语也有距离，选择的时候很费工夫，好容易选定了，还得作详细的注释），这是阻碍我们自由地选取古代文学作品的主要因素。初中阶段不学文言，这是公认的原则。初中语文课本就很难选入古人的作品。高中阶段开始学习一些文言。既然是开始，学的一定很浅易。选材的时候，为了顾到学习程度，就不能不受若干限制。“我们历史上有多少伟大的诗人，创造了多少美丽的诗歌”，不错。问题在怎么样从其中挑选出一些篇章，学生凭了初学文言的能力能够了解欣赏的，拿来编入课本。我们曾经看过苏联学校里和我国中学相当年级的文学读本。那些读本选录了普希金、契诃夫、屠格涅夫、托尔斯泰。我们的课本可不能这么办，我们有语言文字上的障碍。
    这是一个问题。怎么样解决，值得研究。江先生提出了“重述”跟“介绍”的方法。我们认为重述的文章不能算是文学作品；介绍只能帮助欣赏文学作品，读介绍的文章不等于欣赏文学作品。解决这个问题的适当办法该是什么呢？我们热切地希望研究我国古代文学的同志们，中学语文教师们，大家共同研究，展开讨论。——江先生又提出了文学史的研究。在中学阶段，过去曾经设过文学史的科目，编过文学史的课本。学生没有读过好多文学作品，空学文学史，结果只知道“汉赋”“唐诗”“宋词”“元曲”“建安七子”“初唐四杰”一堆名词，没有什么旁的成绩。江先生又提出了“有系统的介绍”。这个办法过去也曾经行过，商务、中华都出版过按文学史系统来编选的高中国文课本。现在如果再来编选，观点立场固然应该改变，但是那种像历史博物馆似的把历代作品罗列起来的“系统”，就教学的效果上说，仍然是可以怀疑的。
    我们的课本选的翻译文章比较多，江先生指出这是个缺点。我们在编辑的时候曾经注意到这一点，也有别人提出过。这是应该改正的。我们准备另外选一些材料来调换一部分翻译文章。在改编完成以前，原来的课本还得供应一段时期。我们请求教师们教学翻译文章的时候注意以下几点。第一，进行分析研究要跟我国的情况联系，掌握主题要跟思想教育联系。例如初中语文课本第四册第三课《辽尼亚和他的祖母》，是从苏联作家格洛斯曼的《人民是不朽的》里节选的。写的虽然是苏联的事物，但是其中热爱祖国憎恶敌人的主题，让学生分析体会之后，同样地能够收到爱国主义教育的效果。其次，翻译的文章，在语汇上，句法上，表现方法上，有许多跟我国语文习惯不同的，教学的时候应该提出来比较研究。有的可以吸收过来，丰富我们的语文资料。有的应该加以说明，按照我国语文习惯就该怎么样说。这种研究对于学生语文的学习是有益的。再其次，江先生指出的“写外国事物的文章”，我们认为应该跟翻译文章区别开来。选入这些文章都有一定的目的，教学的时候请教师们给学生指点。例如初中语文课本选了《罗伯逊》、《美国的黑人》（第一册）、《注文津的海战》、《在北极》、《在雅尔达》（第二册）、《最幸福的人》（第四册）等等，假如不光是读读所写的故事，还能仔细体会各篇的涵义，那就不会因为写的是外国事物，就减少了通过语文课进行思想教育的效果。
    最后，附带谈一谈江先生指出的关于《游雁宕山记》《黄河上打冰》《群众在哪里》三篇教材的问题。
    江先生举出《游雁宕山记》的最后一句《余见四山云雨凄迷，不能不为明晨忧也》，《黄河上打冰》里引谢灵运的诗《北风劲且哀》，认为运用《忧》《哀》两个词儿《带有哀伤的情感》。这个看法，我们不能同意。看见云雨凄迷，恐怕影响明晨的游览，正是一种积极的情绪，何尝带有哀伤的情感？《北风劲且哀》的《哀》也不是悲哀的意思，读了全文就可以领会。《游雁宕山记》是从《徐霞客游记》里节选的，《黄河上打冰》是从《老残游记》里节选的。这两部书是我国的文学名著，节选这两篇正是想把这两部书介绍给学生，让他们“窥豹一斑”。我们不能看见《忧》《哀》两个词儿就说“带有哀伤的情感”，更不能把这两篇看做“庸俗无聊的写景文”。
    《群众在哪里》是从《中国青年》第二十九期选来的。编者曾经和作者吴一铿同志商量过，并且经过作者加以修改。这个剧本的主题是指斥某些知识分子口口声声要深入群众，要做群众工作，可是接触了群众之后，遇到一些具体事实跟自己的利益抵触，就推开了群众，忽视了群众利益。这个剧本上演的效果很好。选来做语文教材，可以揭露知识分子的缺点，收到教育的效果。我们收到很多对于语文课本提出的意见，还没收到说这个剧本不适宜做教材的。江先生认为“会有不好的作用”，这是我们想不到的。我们重新把这个剧本仔细研究，看不出如江先生说的“它用大半篇幅描写农民的脏与青年学生的嫌脏”。江先生认为这个剧本“正面表现农民的勤劳、勇敢和其他优秀品质是不够的”。我们的看法刚刚相反，读完这个剧本，对于农民余淑清肃然起敬，丝毫也没有“脏”的感觉。
    和江先生不同的意见就是这些个，提出来请江先生指教。
