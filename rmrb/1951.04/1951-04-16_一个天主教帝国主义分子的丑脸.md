　　The Ugly Face of a Catholic Imperialist

　　In May 1948, the imperialist element, Cardinal Spellman, Archbishop of New York, came to China. The Kuomintang bandit gang immediately bustled about, welcoming this "honored guest." Bandit chieftains Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren both sent representatives to the airport to wait respectfully, and the puppet Executive Yuan's Information Bureau busied itself filming a newsreel of "Spellman's Visit to China," truly a show of "immense pomp."
　　What kind of person was Spellman actually? The "Spellman Special Issue" of *Yishi Weekly* (Volume 30, Issue 24), edited by the secret agent chieftain Yu Bin, provides some interesting material.
　　The secret agent chieftain, Yu Bin, a loyal running dog of imperialism, revealed it in his speech "Welcoming Cardinal Spellman's Visit to China" at a tea party at Aurora University. He said: "Our American friends (should read: imperialist elements—the author), consistently and unswervingly, have always been our support, giving us much encouragement and inspiration. Now that you have come, it fits the old Chinese saying: 'Sharing the worries of others.'"
　　Spellman came to China for the purpose of "Sharing the worries of others." This indeed reflected the actual situation at the time. 1948 was indeed a worrisome year for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. In that year, the People's Liberation Army established the Central Plains Liberated Area, recovered Yan'an, recovered most of the Shandong Liberated Area, liberated 97 percent of the Northeast and Jehol provinces, and wiped out the enemy's central strongholds in the North China Liberated Area except for Taiyuan. The People's Liberation Army had shifted from defense to offense, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was on the verge of collapse. The Chiang bandits felt deeply "worried," and the imperialist elements also felt deeply "worried." Thus, Spellman came to China to cheer up the butcher Chiang Kai-shek. At that time, the lackeys of imperialism, the "editors" of *Yishi Weekly*, said with tearful gratitude: "It's as if trapped in a besieged孤城, ... suddenly an angel flew in from the horizon."
　　However, Spellman's task was by no means limited to simply cheering up the butcher; his greater mission was to prepare tools for the butchers to kill people. At the banquet welcoming this imperialist element, Chiang Kai-shek shamelessly begged him: "Now that we are in the midst of suppressing the rebellion, it is timely that Cardinal Spellman has come to China, ... because the Cardinal is a good friend of China (should read: the Chinese reactionary ruling class), I believe that after the Cardinal returns home, there will be much help in terms of the spirit and material of China (should read: the Chinese reactionary ruling class)." Spellman readily agreed to Chiang Kai-shek's request. He said: "Because America today wants to aid China, I am very happy, and I am very willing to do what I can to promote aid to China (should read: 'aid Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang in fighting the civil war')."
　　This imperialist element, wearing the cloak of religion, swindling and bluffing everywhere, did not conceal his political face. He openly declared: "My views have always been consistent with President Chiang's, believing in sacrificing everything to resist communism." Why is communism so terrifying to people like Spellman?
　　The problem is very simple. This "Archbishop" is an imperialist element, and he is irreconcilable with the people. Therefore, he is also irreconcilable with the leader of the Chinese people—the Communist Party. But the development of things is contrary to the wishes of imperialism, and the Chinese people have stood up and established a new China of people's democracy. Therefore, this "Archbishop" does not know where he has run off to.

　　一个天主教帝国主义分子的丑脸
    植
    一九四八年五月，帝国主义分子纽约总主教史培尔曼枢机来到中国。国民党匪帮立刻忙作一团，迎接“上宾”。匪首蒋介石、李宗仁都派出代表到机场恭候，伪行政院新闻局忙于给他拍摄一部“史培尔曼访华”的新闻片子，真可算是“声势赫赫”。
    史培尔曼究竟是个什么样的人物呢？在特务头子于斌主编的《益世周刊》，史培尔曼专辑（三十卷二十四期）中，提供了一些有趣的材料。
    特务头子帝国主义的忠实走狗于斌，在他在震旦大学茶会上所作“欢迎史培尔曼枢机访华”的讲话中，即曾透露出来。他说：“我们的美国友人（应是：帝国主义分子——笔者），始终不渝，一向是我们的支持，给我们许多鼓励和灵感，现在你们来了，正合一句中国的古谚：“忧人之忧”。
    史培尔曼来到中国的目的是“忧人之忧”，这的确反映了当时的实际情况。一九四八年，正是蒋介石匪帮可忧的一年。在这一年，人民解放军建立了中原解放区，收复了延安，收复了山东解放区的绝大部分，解放了东北及热河百分之九十七的土地，肃清了敌人留在华北解放区内除太原以外的中心据点。人民解放军已从防御转入进攻，蒋介石匪帮眼看要坍台了。蒋匪深感“可忧”，帝国主义分子也深感“可忧”。于是，史培尔曼来到中国，给屠夫蒋介石打气。当时，帝国主义的走卒们益世周刊的“编者”曾经感激涕零地说：“好像陷于被围攻的孤城中，………忽然从天涯飞来了天使”。
    但是，史培尔曼的任务绝不止于单纯给屠夫打气，他的更大的使命，是给屠夫们准备杀人的工具。蒋匪介石在欢迎这个帝国主义分子的宴会上，曾厚颜无耻地向他乞求：“现在我们在戡乱的时候，适逢史枢机来华，………因为枢机是中国（应读为中国反动统治阶级）的好友，相信枢机返国以后，对中国（应读为中国反动统治阶级）的精神和物质方面，一定有很多帮助”。史培尔曼对于蒋匪的要求，满口应允。他说：“因为美国今日要援华，我很高兴，并且很愿意以我个人能力所做得到的，提倡援华（应读作‘援助蒋介石匪帮打内战’）。”
    这位披着宗教的外衣，到处招摇撞骗的帝国主义分子，并没有掩饰他的政治面目。他曾公开宣称：“我与蒋总统的意见，向来一致，认为不惜牺牲一切，来反抗共产主义”。对于史培尔曼之类说来，共产主义为什么这样可怕呢？
    问题是很简单的。这个“总主教”是个帝国主义分子，他与人民是誓不两立的。因而，他与中国人民的领导者——共产党也是誓不两立的。但是事情的发展和帝国主义的愿望相反，中国人民已经站立起来成立了人民民主的新中国。因此，这个“总主教”就不知道跑到什么地方去了。
