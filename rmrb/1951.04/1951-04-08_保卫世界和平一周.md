Week for Defending World Peace

	Asian Countries Demand the Conclusion of a Peace Pact
	The people of Asian countries warmly support the declaration and resolutions of the World Peace Council. Peace fighters in various countries are preparing for or have already launched signature campaigns demanding that the five major powers of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France conclude a peace pact.
	The Chinese people, with over 200 million having signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal, will launch a signature campaign for the conclusion of a peace pact in late April. The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front passed a resolution fully supporting the World Peace Council's "Declaration on the Conclusion of a Peace Pact" and "Resolution on the United Nations." The resolution pointed out that the Korean people will ensure that the military adventures of the chief culprit of new war instigators – the American imperialists – in the Korean battlefield end in shameful failure. In Vietnam, the National Congress convened to merge the Viet Minh and the Lien Viet, and the Vietnam Peace Committee, both sent telegrams to the World Peace Council expressing their support for and implementation of the Council's resolutions. The representatives of the Congress unanimously supported the declaration demanding the five major powers to conclude a peace pact and signed it. The Congress decided to launch a nationwide signature collection campaign. In India, the signature campaign demanding the five major powers to conclude a peace pact has already begun. Peace fighters in cities such as Bombay, Madras, Coimbatore, Dharapuram, and Nowgong are widely publicizing the World Peace Council's declarations and resolutions. On India's "National Peace Day" (March 25), 8,000 residents of Calcutta held a commemorative meeting, demanding that the five major powers immediately hold a meeting to negotiate and sign a peace pact.

	Chinese, Japanese, and Burmese People Oppose Arming Japan
	Recently, in our country, Japan, and Burma, movements have been enthusiastically launched to oppose the U.S. rearmament of Japan and strive for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.
	In its circular issued on March 14 regarding the popularization and deepening of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, this association called on the people of the country to hold small-scale gatherings in late April to conduct public opinion polls widely opposing the U.S. arming of Japan. Demonstrations and marches against the U.S. arming of Japan are continuing to develop. In the Central-South and Southwest regions alone, over 140 counties and cities, and some rural areas, have held demonstrations and marches against the arming of Japan. In some minority areas in the Southwest region, symposiums have also been held to oppose the arming of Japan and denounce Japanese atrocities.
	The Japanese Communist Party held its Fourth National Congress in late February. The Congress passed a resolution on expanding the national democratic united front. This resolution is intended to strengthen the struggle against a separate peace and strive for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty.
	On March 2, 34 trade union organizations in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, held a meeting, deciding to expand the signature campaign for a comprehensive peace treaty throughout the prefecture. The Ehime Prefecture Committee of the Japanese Communist Party called on various opposition parties to form a united front in local elections to fight for a comprehensive peace treaty and oppose rearmament. The people of Gifu City and the small and medium-sized industrial associations and chambers of commerce and industry in the southern district of Tokyo held peace treaty symposiums in early March, deciding to launch a signature collection campaign for a comprehensive peace treaty.
	During World War II, the people of Burma suffered greatly under the Japanese imperialists, and they still vividly remember the suffering brought to them by the Japanese invaders. March 27 was Burma's Anti-Japanese Resistance Day, and people from all walks of life in Rangoon held a commemorative gathering of more than 4,000 people on that day, and protested against the U.S. rearmament of Japan. U Wun, representative of the All Burma Labor Association, said at the meeting: The traces of the Japanese invaders trampling on the Burmese people have not yet disappeared, and we resolutely oppose the rearmament of Japan to slaughter the people again.

	European and Latin American Communist Parties Grow and Develop
	The Communist Parties of Europe and America, shouldering the important task of leading the struggle for peace, are growing stronger; recently, they have held meetings one after another, deciding to combine the defense of world peace with the struggle for democracy in their respective countries.
	The Communist Parties of Italy, Belgium, Sweden, Finland, Brazil, Uruguay and other countries have recently held congresses, and passed resolutions, deciding to intensify the struggle for peace and the democratic and free rights of the working people, and calling on the people to oppose the war and aggression plans of U.S. imperialism.
	The Belgian Communist Party Congress demanded that Belgium withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Swedish Communist Party Congress called the people's attention to the seriousness of the rearmament of West Germany, and called on the people to support the declaration for the conclusion of a peace pact. The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States recently issued a statement, calling for the combination of the struggle to defend democratic rights with the struggle for peace. The resolution of the National Committee of the Communist Party of Brazil called for the establishment of a national democratic front to oppose sending Brazilians as cannon fodder in the war of aggression against Korea.
	In the struggle to defend peace and oppose the reactionary measures of domestic governments, the Communist Parties of various countries have become increasingly closely linked with the masses of the people, and have strengthened their own strength. The number of members of the Italian Communist Party has increased from more than 1.7 million at the end of 1945 to more than 2.57 million (including more than 460,000 members of the Communist Youth League), the number of members of the Belgian Communist Party has increased more than four times compared with 1940, and the Austrian Communist Party has developed 7,000 new members from January 10 to March 1 this year.
	The growth and development of the Communist Parties of various countries is a guarantee that the world's movement to defend peace will surely triumph.
