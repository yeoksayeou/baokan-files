To the Editor:
    After the An'guo County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei Province publicized the benefits of cotton pre-purchasing to cotton farmers, it has begun to carry out cotton pre-purchase work. Cotton farmers are very happy about this.

    The Supply and Marketing Cooperative has now signed contracts with 201 cotton farmers for the pre-purchase of more than 100,000 jin of seed cotton. The 70 cotton farmers in Lijiazhuang, after signing a contract with the cooperative to pre-purchase more than 37,000 jin of seed cotton, further entrusted the cooperative to pay public grain and pre-levy 10,670 jin of cotton on their behalf. The cotton farmers' concerns about cotton prices and other aspects have been eliminated. For example, cotton farmer Li Daqiu said: "Signing a contract has four major benefits: (1) You don't have to worry about cotton prices falling and not being able to sell it; (2) You don't have to worry about being short-weighed; (3) You don't have to worry about damage from rats and theft; (4) You don't have to worry about smoke damage and cotton deterioration."

　　安国县植棉农民纷纷和供销社订立预购合同编辑同志：
    河北省安国县供销社经过向棉农宣传后，已展开棉花预购工作。棉农对此十分欢迎。
    供销社现已和二百零一户棉农订立了预购籽棉十万余斤的合同。立家庄的七十户棉农，与合作社签订了预购籽棉三万七千余斤的合同后，并进一步委托合作社代缴公粮和预征棉花一万零六百七十斤。棉农对于棉花价格及其他方面的种种顾虑已经消除。如棉农李大秋说：“订了合同有四大好处：（一）不怕棉价下跌卖不掉；（二）不怕亏秤；（三）不怕老鼠损坏和贼偷；（四）不怕烟熏，棉花变质。
