Tianjin, April 23 (Xinhua News Agency) – Over Ten Thousand Catholics in Tianjin Hold Demonstration and Parade to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea

Adopt Patriotic Covenant of Catholic Followers in the City, Vote Against US Arming Japan, and Sign in Support of Concluding a Peace Covenant.

　　Tianjin Catholic figures held a grand demonstration and parade today to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Participants in the demonstration and parade included Wu Kezhai, Chairman of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association, Zhao Zhenya, Deputy Bishop of the Tianjin Diocese, Chinese priests, nuns, and followers from all Catholic churches in the city, teachers and students from fifteen large and medium-sized Catholic schools, and peasant followers from suburban areas, totaling over ten thousand people. Zhou Shutao, Deputy Mayor of Tianjin, and Huang Songling, Chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Association, were also invited to participate.

　　The conference was opened by Wu Kezhai. He said: Since the establishment of the Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association half a month ago, patriotic followers have held many symposiums and accusation meetings. Everyone has initially recognized the essence of imperialism using the church for aggression. Today's demonstration and parade to resist US aggression and aid Korea is held at the request of the followers.

　　Zhou Shutao and Huang Songling respectively represented the Municipal People's Government and the Tianjin Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Branch in welcoming the patriotic actions of Catholics. They pointed out that the participation of Tianjin Catholics with all the people of Tianjin in the great Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea movement is a glorious action in the history of Catholics.

　　Deputy Bishop Zhao Zhenya said in his speech: We should continue our efforts to launch the reform movement and be sure to eradicate imperialism at its roots. He also called on patriotic followers to unite with non-Catholics to oppose US imperialism's separate peace with Japan and rearmament of Japan.

　　At the meeting, Fan Enkun, a representative of Catholic schools, exposed the truth of imperialist elements wearing sheep's clothing but hiding the hearts of wolves. He said: Imperialist elements do not admit that imperialism uses religion, but they organize special agent organizations such as the "Catholic Patriotic Corps." Imperialist elements say that religion is above politics, but Yu Bin participated in political activities against the motherland and the people. They do not regard these as anti-sacred canon, but they blame the patriotic actions of Chinese Catholics. Liu Xueyi, a student representative from Tianjin University, and Li Zengzhi, a student representative from Sacred Heart Girls' High School, used examples to illustrate how imperialist elements paralyze and enslave young students and carry out special agent activities in Catholic schools. They unanimously expressed their determination to eliminate the toxins left by imperialism in our minds in the anti-imperialist and patriotic movement. Xiao Tianru, an old chairman of the Xikai Church, a representative of the followers, listed the facts of Japanese imperialist aggression against China for more than 50 years, and called on all followers to rise up and oppose the US arming of Japan.

　　The conference then read and passed the Tianjin Catholic Followers' Patriotic Covenant, voted against US imperialism's arming of Japan, and signed the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace covenant by the five major powers. After the conference presented banners and condolences to the Chinese and Korean People's Forces, the parade began.

　　The parade was led by Wu Kezhai, Zhao Zhenya, and thirty-one Chinese priests and twenty nuns from the city. In the parade, there were white-haired old women and women holding infants. From Jizhuangzi, fifteen miles away from Tianjin, more than seventy of the one hundred and twenty Catholic followers in the whole village came to participate in this conference. Liu, an elderly woman from the village who is seventy-three years old, had not been to Tianjin for seventy years. Today, she came with her son and grandson to participate. He, an elderly woman in her sixties, did not own a piece of land before liberation, and her four sons were all hired workers for landlords. Now she has been allocated seven acres of land. Today, except for her second daughter-in-law who stayed at home to take care of the children, everyone else in her family participated in this conference. He said: I am doing this for the sake of loving the country, loving the church, and loving the fruits of victory given to us by Chairman Mao. The parade was welcomed by the general public along the way.

　　天津万余天主教徒
　  举行抗美援朝示威游行大会
　  通过全市教友爱国公约，投票反对美国武装日本，签名拥护缔结和平公约。
    天津市天主教人士于今日举行盛大的抗美援朝示威游行大会。参加示威游行大会的有天津市天主教革新运动促进会主任委员吴克斋、天津教区副主教赵振亚、全市各天主教堂中国神父、修女、教徒及天主教十五个大、中、小学校师生和郊区农民教徒等共一万余人。天津市人民政府副市长周叔韬、天津市抗美援朝分会主席黄松龄也应邀参加。
    大会由吴克斋致开会词。他说：天主教革新运动促进会成立半个月以来，爱国的教友们召开了许多次座谈会、控诉会，大家在思想上已初步认清了帝国主义利用教会进行侵略的本质。今天的抗美援朝示威游行大会就是在教友们的要求下举行的。
    周叔韬、黄松龄分别代表市人民政府及天津抗美援朝分会欢迎天主教徒的爱国行动。他们指出：天津市天主教徒与全天津市人民一起参加伟大的抗美援朝运动，是天主教徒在历史上的光荣的行动。
    赵振亚副主教在讲话中说：我们应该再接再厉地展开革新运动，一定要达到将帝国主义连根拔掉。他还号召爱国的教徒，要与非教徒团结一致，反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和、重新武装日本。
    会上，天主教学校代表范恩锟揭露了帝国主义分子外披羊皮内藏狼心的真相。他说：帝国主义分子不承认帝国主义利用宗教，但是他们却组织了“公教报国团”这种特务组织。帝国主义分子说宗教是超政治的，但于斌就参加了反祖国反人民的政治活动。他们把这些不算作反圣教法典，却来责备中国教徒的爱国行动。津沽大学学生代表刘学义、圣功女中学生代表李增志并用实例说明帝国主义分子在天主教学校中如何麻痹与奴役青年学生，并进行特务活动。他们一致表示，要在反帝爱国运动中肃清帝国主义在我们思想上留下的毒素。教友代表西开教堂老会长萧天如列举了五十余年来日本帝国主义侵略中国的事实，号召全体教友起来反对美国武装日本。
    大会接着宣读并通过了天津市天主教教友爱国公约，全体投票反对美帝国主义武装日本，并在世界和平理事会关于五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签名。大会向中朝人民部队献锦旗及慰问品后，即开始游行。
    游行队伍由吴克斋、赵振亚及全市三十一位中国神父、二十余位修女为前导。在游行行列中，有白发苍苍的老太太，有抱着乳婴的妇女。离天津十五里路的纪庄子，全村一百二十余天主教徒就有七十余人赶来参加这个大会。该村七十三岁的刘老太太，七十年没有来过天津，今天她带着儿子、孙子赶来参加。六十多岁的何老太太，解放前他家没有一亩地，四个儿子都给地主当雇工，现在她已经分到七亩地，今天她家除二媳妇留在家中看小孩外，其余的人都参加了这个大会。何老太太说：我为的是爱国、爱教、爱毛主席给我们的胜利果实。游行队伍沿途受到广大市民的欢迎。
