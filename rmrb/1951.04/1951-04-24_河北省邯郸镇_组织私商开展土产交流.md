　　Handan Town, Hebei Province

　　Organizes Private Merchants to Develop Local Product Exchange

　　Handan Town, Hebei Province, has achieved considerable success in organizing private merchants to develop local product exchange. The town is a distribution center for mountain goods and local products in southern Hebei Province. However, the state-owned trade and cooperative in the town have limited capacity, and the town has a large number of commercial households (accounting for 70% of the town's industrial and commercial households) with small capital, so it is necessary to organize private merchants. Based on this situation, the town's people's government and state-owned trade organs first organized private merchants to investigate the production and sales of local products around the town, and formulated a plan for purchasing and selling local products. During the investigation, the mountain goods industry learned that farmers in 14 counties including Wu'an and Shexian sell mountain goods and local products worth about 110 billion yuan each year, while state-owned trading companies and cooperatives can only purchase one-third, and the remaining local products need to rely on private merchants to purchase. The ironware industry learned that farmers in 22 surrounding counties need ironware worth about 2.2 billion yuan every six months, while the industry's capital is only over 100 million yuan. After the two industries conducted the investigation, they realized the broad prospects for local product management and strengthened their business confidence. They also automatically formulated a plan to expand their capital, and determined specific business methods based on the amount of capital. In this way, each industry has determined its own business scope and goals.

　　Secondly, various measures were taken to overcome the difficulties of insufficient capital for small merchants. The first is to organize joint operations. From last autumn to the present, statistics from 14 industries such as mountain goods show that there are 22 relatively fixed joint operation organizations, including 145 households. After the joint operation, the difficulties of "short legs and small capital" were overcome, and manpower and financial resources were saved. The second is to organize private merchants to establish purchase and exchange relationships with farmers on credit. For example, Tongyi Mountain Goods Store in the town was helped to establish a purchase relationship with 200 villages in Linxian County, purchasing 10,000 jin of peach kernels on credit every six months, and purchasing 140,000 jin of salt and about 40 barrels of kerosene for the masses. Now 300 private merchants have established relationships with farmers in 20 counties including Qingfeng. In addition, they are organized and mobilized to allow farmers in mountainous areas to invest in kind with mountain goods and local products. In this item alone, the mountain goods industry has increased its capital by more than 100 million yuan.

　　In order to develop inter-regional material exchange and expand the sales of local products, the town's people's government and trade organizations simultaneously led private merchants to establish extensive contacts with merchants from other places and carry out trust business. The town's trust merchants have now developed from two to eight.

　　河北省邯郸镇
   组织私商开展土产交流
    河北省邯郸镇组织私商开展土产交流工作，已有不少成绩。该镇为河北省南部山货土产的集散地。但该镇国营贸易与合作社力量有限，加以该镇商业户户数多（占全镇工商户数百分之七十）而资金小，所以组织私商就很有必要。该镇人民政府与国营贸易机关根据此种情况，首先组织私商调查了该镇周围的土产产销情况，制定了购销土产的计划。在调查中，山货业了解到武安、涉县等十四个县农民每年出售山货土产总值约一千一百亿元，而国营贸易公司与合作社仅能收购三分之一，所余土产均需依靠私商收购。铁货业了解到周围二十二个县农民半年需铁货价值约二十二亿元，而该业资金也仅有一亿余元。两业经过调查后，认识到土产经营的广阔前途，增强了经营信心。并自动制定了扩大资金的计划，根据资金大小情况，确定具体经营方式。这样，各业都确定了自己的经营范围和奋斗目标。
    其次，是采取各种办法，克服了小商户资金不足的困难。第一是组织联营。该镇去秋至今，仅山货等十四个行业统计，较固定的联营组织即有二十二个，包括一百四十五户。联营后，克服了“腿短、资金小”的困难，节省了人力和财力。其次是组织私商与农民建立赊购、换购关系。如帮助镇内通益山货栈和林县二百个村建立了赊购关系，半年赊购桃仁一万斤，代群众购盐十四万斤，煤油约四十桶。现在已有三百家私商和清丰等二十县农民建立了关系。另外，并组织与动员山地农民以山货土产实物入股。仅此一项，山货业各货栈就增加资金一亿余万元。
    为开展地区间的物资交流，扩大土产销量，该镇人民政府与贸易机构同时领导私商广泛地与外地商人建立联系，开展信托业务。该镇信托商户现在已由两家发展到八家。
