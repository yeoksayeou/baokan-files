　　Commemorating the Fifth Anniversary of the Death of Uncle Wang Ruofei
　　Guang Sheng

　　It has been five years since my uncle, Wang Ruofei, passed away. That was after Japan's surrender. The people of the whole country, after eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, urgently needed peace and democracy. However, American imperialism vigorously supported the Kuomintang in launching a civil war. At that time, my uncle was busy striving for the realization of domestic peace. As a result, he died in a plane crash at Black Tea Mountain. The Chinese people lost an outstanding leader, the Party lost an excellent cadre, the family lost a respected elder, and everyone was extremely saddened, determined to fight for the realization of the martyrs' ideals.

　　For five years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have defeated the Kuomintang bandit gang, liberated mainland China, convened the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, adopted the Common Program, and established the Central People's Government, realizing the preliminary ideals of the martyrs. However, the construction of the new China needs many strong cadres. The deaths of comrades such as my uncle, Bo Gu, and Ye Ting make us feel even more acutely the need for their presence now. Thousands upon thousands of comrades are saddened that they cannot participate in the construction and life of the new China, and thousands upon thousands of people are transforming this sorrow into strength.

　　In his childhood, my uncle participated in the Xinhai Revolution in Guizhou. Later, he joined the Communist Party in France. After returning to China, he participated in the Great Revolution of 1925 to 1927. He was one of the organizers and participants of the three Shanghai uprisings. After Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal and the failure of the Great Revolution, he participated in leading the armed resistance of peasants against landlords in the Subei area. In 1931, when Japan attacked Northeast China and then invaded North China and Inner Mongolia, my uncle went to Inner Mongolia to prepare to organize the people to resist the Japanese invaders. Unfortunately, he was arrested in Suiyuan. During the escort (he thought he was going to the execution ground), he was fearless and loudly publicized to the masses the principles of resisting Japan, uniting with the Soviet Union, stopping the civil war, and uniting against foreign enemies, shocking the rulers at that time. In prison, he firmly believed that in three to five years, China would definitely undergo new changes. In July 1937, the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out. After my uncle was released from prison that year, he went to Yan'an to assist the Party and Chairman Mao in their work, and participated in the formulation of policies such as rent reduction and interest reduction in the anti-Japanese base areas. In the late stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan and after Japan's surrender, my uncle participated in and led the democratic movement in the rear of Chongqing, opposed the dictatorial rule of Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek, participated in the political consultative conference at that time, and fought against the extremely vicious reactionaries for the sake of people's democracy. I remember that after his death, Mr. Guo Moruo called him "a bastion of democratic spirit" in his elegy. In short, throughout his life, my uncle waged resolute and courageous struggles against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism for the independence of the nation and the liberation of the people, never considering his personal safety, entering and leaving prisons and courts, facing bullets and artillery fire, and not hesitating to sacrifice himself.

　　Throughout his life, my uncle was loyal and honest to the people, the organization, and his comrades. In Suiyuan Prison, he not only cared for his fellow inmates in life, but also helped them make progress politically. At that time, a comrade named Yang Zhilin, who was in prison, later said to my aunt: Comrade Ruofei's teachings in prison made me begin to accept Marxism-Leninism. My uncle had no concept of personal fame or status at all. He tried his best to complete any task assigned to him by the Party, and he only knew how to work selflessly. I remember that in Yan'an, everyone gathered together to chat on Sundays, and every time he chatted for a few minutes, he would excuse himself and go back to the office to work or study. His personal life was extremely difficult. In 1939 in Yan'an, his bed was extremely simple, and the sheets were laid on grass. He actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to participate in the Great Production Movement and went up the mountains to reclaim wasteland and grow grain. His style was humble and simple. No matter what position he held or what work he did, he never told his relatives. He worked hard and was eager to learn. He only attended elementary school in his childhood, but through his own efforts, he became a very capable and knowledgeable person. I remember after Japan's surrender, he temporarily returned to Yan'an. Once, while talking about the atomic bomb at the entrance of his cave dwelling, he asked me some questions about electricity. Although I worked in a radio station, I couldn't answer them; later he explained it, and he explained it very well. At that time, I secretly thought, he really knows a lot! In short, my uncle was a tempered Communist Party member with noble qualities.

　　This year, when we commemorate the martyrs, it is also the time when American imperialism is frantically invading our friendly neighbor Korea, continuing to aid the remnants of the Kuomintang, and sending special agents and spies to mainland China to carry out sabotage. We must learn from Comrade Wang Ruofei's spirit of resolute struggle against the enemy throughout his life, and further popularize and deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea.

### 纪念王若飞舅父遇难五周年

　　纪念王若飞舅父遇难五周年
　　光绳
    舅舅王若飞遇难已五周年了。那是日本投降以后，全国人民经过八年的艰苦抗战，迫切地需要和平，需要民主的时候。美帝国主义却大力支持国民党发动内战。当时舅舅为了争取实现国内的和平而四处奔忙。结果坐飞机在黑茶山遇难了。中国人民损失了一位优秀的领导者，党损失了一个优秀的干部，家庭损失了一位敬爱的长者，大家痛心已极，决心为实现烈士们的理想而奋斗。
    五年了，中国人民在共产党和毛主席的领导下，打败了国民党匪帮，解放了中国大陆，召开了中国人民政治协商会议，通过了共同纲领，成立了中央人民政府，实现了先烈们的初步理想。但新中国的建设，正需要许多坚强的干部。舅舅、博古、叶挺等同志的遇难，使我们现在更感到他们存在的需要；千千万万的同志都为他们不能参与新中国的建设与生活而伤痛，千千万万的人则又把这种伤痛变为力量。
    舅舅幼年时，即在贵州参加了辛亥革命。后来在法国加入了共产党。回国后又参加了一九二五至一九二七年的大革命。他是上海三次暴动的组织者，和参加者之一。蒋介石叛变、大革命失败后，他参加领导了苏北一带农民的武装反抗地主的斗争。一九三一年日本进攻东北继又入侵华北、内蒙时，舅舅到了内蒙，准备组织人民反抗日本侵略者。不幸于绥远被捕。在被押解途中（他以为是赴刑场），他毫无惧色，大声向群众宣传抵抗日本，联合苏联，停止内战，一致对外的道理，而震惊了当时的统治者。在监狱中，他坚信三、五年后，中国一定要发生新的变化。一九三七年七月，抗日战争爆发了。当年舅舅出狱后，遂到延安协助党和毛主席工作，参加制定了抗日根据地的减租减息政策等。抗日战争末期和日本投降后，舅舅在重庆参加和领导了大后方的民主运动，反对国民党蒋介石的独裁统治，参加了当时的政治协商会议，为争取人民的民主而与穷凶极恶的反动派作斗争。记得他遇难后，郭沫若先生在挽诗中称他为“民主精神的一座堡垒”。总之，舅舅的一生，为了民族的独立，人民的解放，向帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义做了坚决勇敢的斗争，从不考虑个人的生命危险，出入监狱法庭，枪林弹雨，粉身碎骨，在所不计。
    舅舅一生对人民，对组织，对同志，都是忠诚老实的。在绥远监狱时，不仅在生活上关心难友，而且在政治上帮助他们进步。当时一位坐牢的杨植林同志，后来对舅母说：在监狱里受若飞同志的教导，使我开始接受了马克思列宁主义。舅舅根本没有个人名誉地位观念，党分配他任何任务，他都努力完成，他只知道忘我地工作。记得在延安时，礼拜天大家集拢一块闲话，每次扯几分钟他就先告辞，回办公室工作或学习去了。他的个人生活极为艰苦。一九三九年在延安时，他的床铺简单极了，被单下面铺的都是草。他积极响应毛主席的号召，参加大生产运动，上山开荒种谷。他的作风谦虚朴素。他不论担任了什么职务，做了什么工作，从不对亲戚讲的。他努力好学，幼年只读过小学，由于自己的努力，成为很有能力很有学问的人。记得日本投降后，他临时回延安，一次在他住的窟洞门口谈起原子弹来，他问了我一些电学上的问题，我虽做电台工作，却答不出来；后来他讲了，讲得很对。当时我暗中想，他知道的东西真不少！总之，舅舅是一个百炼成钢的具有高尚品质的共产党员。
    当今年纪念先烈的时候，正值美帝国主义疯狂侵略我友邦朝鲜，继续援助国民党残余势力，并派遣特务间谍分子来我国大陆进行破坏，我们要学习王若飞同志一生坚决对敌斗争的精神，更普及更深入抗美援朝运动。
