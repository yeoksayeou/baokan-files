The Shanghai People's Representatives Conference of All Circles held its Second Session of the Second Conference from the 11th to the 18th. The conference discussed issues such as popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and the guiding principles of municipal construction. More than 800 representatives attended, and over 90% of them expressed their opinions.

　　After listening to Mayor Chen Yi's report on "Shanghai's Work Tasks for 1951," Liu Changsheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association, gave a report to the conference on "The Shanghai People's Resist America, Aid Korea Movement." He said: The Resist America, Aid Korea movement in Shanghai has already achieved great successes, but there are still many shortcomings. For example, the propaganda and education work for Resist America, Aid Korea has not been done well enough in terms of reaching the masses and connecting with the current practical problems of the masses; many places have not yet signed patriotic pacts, and the patriotic pacts that have been signed have not been well implemented; about 10% of the city's population has not yet received Resist America, Aid Korea education, and in scattered residential areas and places with poor work, it is about 40% or more. In order to further popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the conference accepted and adopted the suggestions made by Chairman Liu Changsheng to the conference: (1) Take the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as the main content of the current Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and promote the universal signing and implementation of patriotic pacts by the people of the city; (2) Take the "Shanghai People's Joint Patriotic Pact" passed by the Shanghai People's Conference of All Circles Against American Arming of Japan as the common struggle program of the people of Shanghai; (3) All democratic parties, people's organizations, and propaganda and education institutions in the city should formulate plans within their respective scopes to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement this year; (4) Starting in late April, various meetings will be held throughout the city, signatures will be collected in support of the conclusion of a peace treaty, and voting on the Japan issue will take place; and in conjunction with the preparation for the "May 1st" celebration, propaganda work on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, opposing American arming of Japan, and defending world peace will be carried out. The delegates unanimously raised their hands in favor of the "Resolution of the World Peace Council on Solving the Japan Issue by Peaceful Means" and signed the "Declaration of the World Peace Council on the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty." The conference passed a telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteers, guaranteeing to support the Volunteers with all their strength.

　　The conference listened to a report by Yang Fan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, on severely suppressing counter-revolutionaries. The representatives from all circles unanimously believed that Shanghai was once a concentrated nest of counter-revolutionary elements, and after liberation, many counter-revolutionary elements and despotic landlords fled to Shanghai from other places. These counter-revolutionary elements have done everything possible to harm the people's cause. In order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, counter-revolutionary elements must be severely suppressed. Representatives from all circles at the meeting accused counter-revolutionary elements of their crimes, and some representatives criticized the past "boundless leniency" bias of the Municipal People's Government in its work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries; some representatives examined their own complacency. Xie Renbing, a representative of the democratic parties, said: In the past, our democratic parties had insufficient understanding of the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and were ideologically complacent, allowing counter-revolutionary elements to take advantage of loopholes; in the future, we must combine the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries with the work of consolidating and developing the organizations of our democratic parties, tighten our organizations, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and never allow counter-revolutionary elements to use our democratic parties as their air-raid shelters. The representatives put forward many practical and feasible methods for suppressing counter-revolutionary work. The conference finally adopted the "Resolution on Severely Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries," instructing the Municipal People's Government to severely suppress all counter-revolutionary elements, and pointed out that suppressing counter-revolutionaries is the responsibility of every person in the city, and the people of the city should support and actively assist the People's Government in carrying out the task of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

　　The conference adopted Mayor Chen Yi's report on "Shanghai's Work Tasks for 1951," reviewed and approved Deputy Mayor Pan Hannian's "Summary of the Work of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government in 1950" and Deputy Mayor Sheng Pihua's "Report on the City's Final Accounts for 1950 and the City's Budget for 1951." The conference accepted Deputy Mayor Pan Hannian's suggestion, and a visiting group to workers' residential areas was organized by representatives Hu Juewen and more than 60 others, who visited the two workers' residential areas of Hudong and Huxi in the rain, and Sun Dayu, a representative of the democratic parties, gave a report on the visit to the conference. The representatives attending the meeting unanimously believed that the water and electricity supply, roads, fire protection, and sanitation facilities in Shanghai's workers' residential areas were very poor and urgently needed improvement. The conference believed that the municipal construction policy put forward by Mayor Chen Yi of serving production and serving workers was completely correct. After discussion and research, the conference believed that the national financial situation had not yet completely improved, and at present, only the policy of "general maintenance and key construction" could be adopted. Many representatives from the business community expressed their willingness to implement the labor insurance regulations first to increase workers' welfare.

　　The Shanghai People's Representatives Conference of All Circles has been exercising the functions and powers of the Municipal People's Congress since its first session. This conference elected the members of the Consultative Committee of the Second Session of the Second Shanghai People's Representatives Conference of All Circles, and elected Chen Yi as the chairman of the committee, and Pan Hannian, Liu Changsheng, Hu Juewen, and Jin Zhonghua as the vice chairmen.

　　上海市各界人民代表会议通过决议
　  发动群众抗美援朝镇压反革命
  　到会代表举行关于日本问题的投票和拥护缔结和平公约的签名
    上海市第二届第二次各界人民代表会议于十一日至十八日举行。会议讨论了普及和深入开展抗美援朝运动、镇压反革命及市政建设方针等问题。出席代表八百余人，有百分之九十以上的代表发表了意见。
    会议听取了陈毅市长的“一九五一年上海市工作任务”的报告后，上海市抗美援朝分会主席刘长胜向会议作了“关于上海人民抗美援朝运动的报告”。他说：上海抗美援朝运动已经有了巨大的成绩，但是还有不少的缺点。例如：抗美援朝宣传教育工作，在深入群众与联系当前群众实际问题方面还做得非常不够；许多地方还没有签订爱国公约，已订的爱国公约还没有很好地执行；全市尚未受到抗美援朝教育的人约在百分之十以上，而在分散的居民中及工作较差的地方，约在百分之四十以上。为了进一步普及与深入抗美援朝运动，会议接受并通过了刘长胜主席向会议提出的建议：（一）把镇压反革命作为目前抗美援朝运动的主要内容，并推动全市人民普遍订立与执行爱国公约；（二）以上海市各界人民反对美国武装日本会议所通过的“上海各界人民共同爱国公约”作为全上海人民的共同斗争纲领；（三）全市各民主党派、各人民团体及各宣传教育机构，应在所属范围内订立在今年内普及与深入抗美援朝运动的计划；（四）从四月下旬起，在全市召开各种会议，举行拥护缔结和平公约的签名及关于日本问题的投票；和筹备纪念“五一”节相结合，同时开展关于镇压反革命、反对美国武装日本、保卫世界和平的宣传工作。到会代表一致举手赞成“世界和平理事会关于以和平方式解决日本问题的决议”，并在“世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言”上签了名。会议通过了致中国人民志愿军电，保证以全力支援志愿军。
    会议听取了上海市人民政府公安局局长杨帆关于严厉镇压反革命的报告。各界代表一致认为：上海过去是反革命分子集中的巢穴，解放后又有许多反革命分子和恶霸地主从其他地方逃来上海。这些反革命分子曾经百般地危害人民事业。为了巩固人民民主专政，对反革命分子必须予以严厉的镇压。各界代表在会上纷纷控诉了反革命分子的罪行，有些代表对市人民政府过去在镇压反革命工作上的“宽大无边”偏向，提出了批评；有些代表检讨了自己的麻痹思想。民主党派代表谢仁冰说：过去我们民主党派对镇压反革命问题认识不足，思想麻痹，使反革命分子钻了空子；今后必须把镇压反革命工作与我们民主党派巩固发展组织的工作结合起来，严密我们的组织，分清敌我，绝不让反革命分子把我们民主党派作为他的防空洞。代表们对镇压反革命工作提出了许多切实可行的办法。会议最后通过了“关于严厉镇压反革命的决议”，责成市人民政府对一切反革命分子予以严厉的镇压，并指出镇压反革命是全市人民每一个人的责任，全市人民应拥护并积极协助人民政府执行镇压反革命的任务。
    会议通过了陈毅市长的“一九五一年上海市工作任务”报告，审查与批准了潘汉年副市长的“上海市人民政府一九五○年工作总结”和盛丕华副市长的“关于一九五○年市决算及一九五一年市预算的报告”。会议接受潘汉年副市长的建议，由代表胡厥文等六十多人组织工人居住区参观团，冒雨访问了沪东、沪西两个工人居住区，并由民主党派代表孙大雨向会议作了访问的报告。出席会议的代表一致认为：上海工人住宅区的水电供应、道路、消防和卫生设备等很差，急需改进。会议认为陈毅市长所提出的为生产服务、为工人服务的市政建设方针，是完全正确的。会议经过讨论和研究后，认为国家财经情况尚未完全好转，目前只能采取“一般维持，重点建设”的方针。许多工商界代表表示愿意首先执行劳动保险条例以增进工人福利。
    上海市各界人民代表会议已自本届第一次会议开始代行市人民代表大会职权。本次会议选举了市第二届第二次各界人民代表会议协商委员会委员，选出陈毅为该会主席，潘汉年、刘长胜、胡厥文、金仲华为副主席。
