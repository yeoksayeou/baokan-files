Vigorously Promote Native Products

Promoting native products is an extremely important task in the 1951 financial and economic work. Because native products are widely distributed, diverse in type, and large in quantity, they account for a large proportion of farmers' total income. According to incomplete statistics from North China alone, the total value of native products in the North China region, excluding commodity grain, cotton, flue-cured tobacco leaves, peanuts, and other cash crops, is approximately equivalent to 7 billion catties of raw grain, accounting for about one-quarter of the total grain production in North China. Since last winter, as a result of the efforts of state-owned trading agencies, cooperatives, and the masses, about 70 percent of all native products in North China have been sold, equivalent to nearly 5 billion catties of raw grain, exceeding the total amount of public grain in North China in 1950. The quantity of native products in other major administrative regions is also very large. If all these native products can be sold, they will play a significant role in improving people's lives. According to the materials from North China, if all native products are sold, it can offset the burden of all agricultural taxes on farmers and provide some additional income. This is certainly a major event. The role of promoting native products is not only to increase people's income and enrich their economic strength, but also has the following important significance:

(1) As farmers sell native products and increase their income, their purchasing power increases, thereby expanding the market for industrial products. The total sales value of industrial products in eighteen industries in Beijing last December increased by 22 percent compared with November. Last winter, 25 billion yuan worth of industrial products were sold to rural areas in Shanxi. According to statistics from 34 villages in Tangshan Prefecture, 230 more livestock and 1,956 new farm tools were added in the past three months. In Hebei, cotton farmers are building houses, wearing floral fabrics, and using thermos bottles more and more every day. In Weixi Village, Cheng'an County, 400 households bought an average of two flashlights per household and one bicycle for every four households. With the development of material exchanges, the number of industrial and commercial households and capital in various cities and towns have increased significantly. Commercial networks in various places have also begun to recover and establish. The number of state-owned trading organizations in Shanxi increased threefold in 1950, and the number of private merchants in six prefectures increased by 5,727. In Handan, the number of firms in nine industries increased by 151 in the second half of last year, with capital of more than 700 million yuan. Industrial products, especially light industrial products, are already in short supply. This shows that China's domestic market for industrial products has infinitely broad ground.

(2) The opening and expansion of the domestic market has broken the blockade of our country's export goods by American imperialists. Some native products that were originally sold abroad can now be sold domestically. For example, peach kernels, a considerable portion of which used to be sold to the United States, were promoted to various parts of the country by a promotion team sent by Shanxi in January this year, and more than 100,000 catties were sold in Shanghai and Wuhan alone. Therefore, the view that the United States has blockaded us and native products have no sales outlets is clearly wrong.

(3) Increased national tax revenue. The frequent exchange of goods and materials, and the recovery and development of industry and commerce, coupled with the results of anti-American and aid-Korea political education, have raised the political consciousness of people from all walks of life. Everyone actively pays taxes, and all kinds of national tax revenues have completed their tasks, thereby powerfully supporting the country's huge financial needs.

The work of promoting native products is now unanimously welcomed by people from all walks of life in urban and rural areas. People from all walks of life are more supportive of the people's government because of the exchange of native products. Not only are the masses of farmers very happy, but many private merchants have made money in promoting native products. They said, "Following the people's government is definitely not wrong." This shows that promoting native products is not only an important link in developing the economy, but also a political issue related to the interests of millions of people. Leading organs in various places must be good at grasping such an important working link.

Although many regions have paid attention to this important work, it has not been universally valued by leading organs across the country. The development of the work of promoting native products is still uneven across the country. Some regions have made great achievements, some are just starting, and some have not yet paid attention. We hope that regions that have already made achievements will resolutely avoid complacency, systematically and on a large scale organize the work of promoting native products, focus on finding sales outlets for unsalable native products, and make the promotion work regularized. Regions that do not pay enough attention or have not yet paid attention to native product work should immediately pay attention to it and take effective measures to actively promote it.

In order to solve the problem of promoting native products, a series of measures should be taken. Holding good native product meetings or native product representative meetings at all levels and in all regions is an important key to completing the task of promoting native products. To hold good native product meetings or native product representative meetings, proper preparations must be made in advance. Trade departments, cooperatives, native product companies, export companies, banks, tax bureaus, transportation departments, federations of industry and commerce, market committees, exchanges, warehouse responsible cadres from all aspects such as the station and representatives of private merchants from all walks of life and representatives of various types of native product producers must participate. The principal leader must be responsible, personally preside over the meeting, explain the importance of promoting native products and the state's policy of rewarding the management of native products, overcome the erroneous views of some cadres who despise commerce, eliminate the various concerns of private merchants, unify the understanding of all parties, and organize the strength and steps of promotion. At the same time, it is necessary to mobilize the participating representatives to fully introduce and study the production, transportation, sales, specifications, prices, seasonality, and past and present material exchange routes of native products, formulate promotion plans, and come up with promotion methods, such as restoring and establishing new and old commercial networks; establishing warehouses; mobilizing and organizing private merchants to go to the countryside to manage native products; establishing and developing supply and marketing cooperatives to truly become the main force in managing native products; promoting the trade contract system; organizing material exchanges between cities and villages, regions and regions (such as Shanxi and Hebei, North China and South China, Guannei and Guanwai); establishing business information bulletins; strengthening transportation work. In addition to the state's transportation departments should plan to adjust the transportation capacity of trains, ships, and automobiles, local party and government leading organs should also actively establish transportation companies and joint ventures to promote native products, develop transportation networks, organize human and animal power, various vehicles and ships, dredge inland rivers and waterways, and renovate cart roads, and help the masses establish transportation cooperatives, etc. If conditions permit, at this kind of native product meeting or native product representative meeting, representatives can also be mobilized to sign written trade agreements or trade contracts with each other; and try to establish lasting trade relations. The leadership of this meeting must fully promote democracy in order to mobilize everyone's enthusiasm for promoting native products.

Vigorously promoting native products only does one aspect of native product work. Leading organs in various places must plan and guide the production of native products separately. For native products that sell well, the masses should be told to improve quality, improve specifications, reduce costs, and expand production; for native products that have no sales outlets for the time being, but can find sales outlets after improving specifications, the masses should be told to improve specifications, consider sales conditions, and carry out production appropriately; for native products that have sales outlets temporarily, but have no future prospects, the masses should be told not to continue to expand production; for native products that have no sales outlets now and in the future, the masses should be told to stop production and switch to other industries. In short, it is necessary to promote planned production and resolutely guard against blind production. In addition, farmers should also be advised not to set the price of native products too high, as they will not be able to sell them if they are too high. The principle of small profits and quick turnover should be adopted first. As long as sales outlets are opened and the goods have credibility, the price will gradually rise.

After the work of promoting native products is carried out, various places must also consider the situation that the demand for industrial products from farmers has increased due to the completion of land reform, bumper harvests, and stable prices, and the supply of industrial products is gradually insufficient, and try to solve it in advance. If the problem of insufficient industrial products is not paid attention to early and gradually solved, there will still be a danger of stagnation in urban and rural exchanges, and the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products will further expand, which will cause great difficulties and dissatisfaction among farmers. The solution to this problem lies in planning to develop local industries, mainly light industries; and at the same time, planning to develop handicrafts that are urgently needed by the vast number of farmers. According to the materials from Hebei Province, 20 percent of the industrial products used by farmers are urban industrial products, and 80 percent are handicraft products. This characteristic will change in the future, but it is estimated that it will not change in the short term. Various places should see this situation, and in addition to increasing the production of machine-made daily necessities, they must also plan to increase the output of handicraft products.

### 大力推销土产

　　大力推销土产
    推销土产，是一九五一年财政经济工作中一个极端重要的工作。因为土产分布广，种类杂，数量多，在全部农民收入中占很大比重。单据华北地区不完全统计，华北全区土产，除商品粮和棉花、烤烟叶、花生等经济作物外，总值约合七十亿斤原粮，约占华北粮食总产量的四分之一。自去冬以来，经国营贸易机关、合作社和群众努力推销的结果，华北全部土产已销出百分之七十左右，约合原粮近五十亿斤，超过了一九五○年华北全部的公粮数目。其他各大行政区的土产数量也很大。这些土产如能全部推销出去，对人民生活的改善，将起重大作用。照华北的材料，如果把土产全部推销出去，就可抵销农民全部农业税的负担，还另外有一些收入。这当然是一件大事。推销土产的作用，不仅可以增加人民收入，充实人民经济力量，而且还有如下的重要意义：
    （一）由于农民出售了土产，增加了收入，购买力就提高了，因而扩大了工业品市场。北京去年十二月份十八个行业工业品销售总值，较十一月份增加了百分之二十二。山西去冬有二五○亿元的工业品销入农村。唐山专区三十四个村统计，去冬三个月内增加牲口二三○头，新添农具一九五六件。河北棉农修盖房屋、穿花布、用热水瓶者一天比一天多了。成安县魏西村四百户人家，平均一户买两个手电，四户买一辆脚踏车。随着物资交流的发展，各个城镇工商业的户数、资金，都有显著增加。各地商业网亦开始恢复和建立。山西国营贸易机构在一九五○年增加了三倍，六个专区私商增加五七二七户；邯郸去年下半年九个行业增加了行栈一五一户，资金七亿余元。工业产品，特别是轻工业产品，已感供不应求。这说明中国工业品的国内市场有无限广阔的园地。
    （二）由于国内市场的开辟和扩大，打破了美帝国主义者对我国某些出口物资的封锁。有些原来外销的土产，现在可以内销了。例如桃仁，过去有不少的一部分销售美国，今年一月间，山西派出推销小组向国内各地推销，仅在上海、武汉两地就销出了十万多斤。因此，那些认为美国封锁我们，土产便没有销路的看法，显然是错误的。
    （三）增加了国家税收。物资交流的频繁，和工商业的恢复与发展，加以抗美援朝政治教育的结果，提高了各界人民的政治觉悟，大家踊跃纳税，国家各项税收都完成了任务，因而有力地支持了国家巨大的财政需要。
    推销土产的工作，现在已受到城乡各阶层人民一致的欢迎。各阶层人民因土产的交流而对人民政府更加拥护。不仅农民群众皆大欢喜，许多私商在推销土产中赚了钱，他们说：“跟着人民政府走，准没有错。”这说明推销土产，不仅是一个发展经济的重要环节，而且也是有关千百万人民利益的政治问题。各地领导机关必须善于掌握这样一个重要的工作环节。
    这一重要工作，许多地区虽然已经注意，但并不是已经被全国各地领导机关所普遍重视。推销土产的工作，在全国的发展还是不平衡的。有的地区已作出了很大成绩，有的才正在着手，有的至今尚未注意。我们希望已经作出成绩的地区，要切戒自满，要更系统地大规模地组织土产推销工作，要着重为滞销的土产找销路，并使推销工作经常化起来。凡重视不够或尚未重视土产工作的地区，应立即加以重视，并采取有效办法，积极地加以推销。
    为了解决土产推销问题，应采取一系列办法。开好各级各区的土产会议或土产代表会议，是完成推销土产任务的重要关键。要想开好土产会议或土产代表会议，事先必须有适当准备，会中必须有贸易部门、合作社、土产公司、出口公司、银行、税务局、交通部门和工商联合会、市集委员会、交易所、货栈各方面的负责干部以及各行各业的私商代表、各类土产生产者的代表参加，并须首长负责，亲自主持，讲清推销土产的重要性和国家奖励经营土产的政策，克服某些干部轻视商业的错误观点，消除私商的各种顾虑，统一各方的认识，组织推销的力量和步调。同时必须发动与会代表相互间充分介绍和研究土产的产、运、销、规格、价格、季节性，和过去现在物资交流的路线等情况，定出推销计划，想出推销办法，如恢复和建立新旧商业网；建立货栈；动员组织私商下乡经营土产；建立和发展供销社，使之真正成为经营土产的主要力量；推广贸易合同制；组织城市与乡村、地区与地区（如山西与河北，华北与华南，关内与关外）之间的物资交流；建立商情通报；加强运输工作，除国家交通部门应有计划地调整火车、轮船和汽车的运输力量外，地方党政领导机关还应积极建立推销土产的运输公司、联营公司，发展运输网，组织人畜力，各种车船，疏浚内河、航道，和整修车马大道，并帮助群众成立运输合作社等。如条件可能，在这种土产会议或土产代表会议上，还可发动代表互相订定书面的贸易协议，或签定贸易合同；并设法建立持久的贸易关系。对这种会议的领导必须充分发扬民主，以便发动大家推销土产的积极性。
    大力推销土产，只做了土产工作的一个方面。各地领导机关必须要有计划地有分别地指导土产的生产。凡是销路好的土产，应告诉群众提高质量，改进规格，降低成本，扩大生产；凡是暂无销路，但改善规格后可以找到销路的，应告诉群众，改善规格，斟酌销路情况，适当地进行生产；凡是暂时有销路，将来没有前途的，应告诉群众，不要再继续扩大生产；凡是现在将来均无销路的，应告诉群众停产转业。总之，要提倡有计划地生产，力戒盲目生产。此外，还应劝告农民，不要把土产价格订得过高，过高了便卖不出去。应该首先采取薄利广销的方针，只要打开了销路，货品有了信誉，价格自会逐渐高起来的。
    推销土产工作开展之后，各地必须同时考虑到由于土地改革完成、农业丰收以及物价稳定等，农民对于工业品的需求增加，工业品的供应逐见不足的情况，并且要预先设法予以解决。对于工业品不足的问题，如果不及早注意，逐步地求得解决，城乡交流仍将有停滞的危险，工农业产品剪刀差将会更加扩大，这将引起农民极大的困难和不满。解决这一问题的方法，在于有计划地放手发展地方工业，其中主要是轻工业；同时有计划地发展广大农民所迫切需要的手工业。根据河北省材料，农民所用的工业品，百分之二十是城市工业品，百分之八十是手工业品，这一个特点，将来是会起变化的，但估计短期还不会改变。各地应该看到这种情况，除增加机器工业日用品的生产外，还须有计划地增加手工业品的产量。
