　　Xinhua News Agency, April 4th dispatch from Berlin: The West German people's movement demanding unification and opposing re-militarization has become even more vigorous due to the Bonn "parliament's" rejection of the German Democratic Republic People's Chamber's proposal to hold All-German negotiations.

　　The Bonn "parliament" shamelessly rejected the People's Chamber's January 30th proposal after delaying for more than a month. Bonn puppet Premier Adenauer openly declared in the Bonn "parliament" on March 9th that All-German negotiations could not solve the problem.

　　Adenauer's actions aroused great anger among the West German people. More than 150 worker representatives from 36 enterprises in Nuremberg, including Communists, Social Democrats, Christian Democrats, and non-partisan individuals, unanimously passed a resolution addressed to the Bonn "parliament" and the Nuremberg City Council at the Second Nuremberg Workers' Congress Against Re-militarization held on March 31st. The resolution stated: "When we heard that Adenauer had basely refused to hold All-German negotiations, we were extremely indignant. The German people and the German working class will gladly undertake the mission rejected by Adenauer. Therefore, we have decided to immediately extend an invitation to the workers of enterprises in Leipzig, so that negotiations between representatives of enterprises in Leipzig and Nuremberg can begin here as soon as possible."

　　Now, the people throughout West Germany have decided to express their will to hold All-German negotiations and achieve unification and peace by holding more and more people's votes. According to Pravda's Berlin correspondent Naumov: In just a few days at the end of March, dozens of people's voting committees have been established in West Germany, and people's votes have already been held in many cities and villages. Eighty to ninety-five percent of those who participated in the voting opposed re-militarization and supported the conclusion of a peace treaty with a unified Germany in 1951. This movement has now swept across West Germany. Many intellectuals, veterans, returned overseas Chinese, clergy, and even a large number of former military officers have joined this movement.

　　阿登纳拒绝举行全德谈判      
    西德人民愤怒抗议       
    人民投票运动广泛展开
    【新华社四日讯】柏林消息：西德人民要求统一，反对重新军国主义化的运动，已因波恩“议会”之拒绝德意志民主共和国人民议会关于举行全德谈判的建议而更加蓬勃开展。
    波恩“议会”是在拖延了一个多月以后，无耻地拒绝人民议会一月三十日的建议的。波恩傀儡总理阿登纳三月九日在波恩“议会”上公然宣布，全德谈判不能解决问题。
    阿登纳的这种行径激起了西德人民极大的愤怒。来自纽伦堡三十六家企业中的一百五十多名共产党、社会民主党、基督教民主党及无党无派的工人代表，在三月三十一日举行的纽伦堡工人反对重新军国主义化第二次代表大会上，一致通过了致波恩“议会”及纽伦堡市议会的决议，其中说：“当我们听到了阿登纳卑鄙地拒绝举行全德谈判时，我们极其愤慨，德国人民与德国工人阶级将欣然担当起被阿登纳拒绝的使命。因此，我们决定立即向来比锡各企业的工人发出邀请，以便尽早在这里开始来比锡与纽伦堡各企业代表之间的谈判。”
    现在，西德全境的人民都决定通过举行越来越多的人民投票，来表达要求举行全德谈判，实现统一与和平的意志。据真理报驻柏林记者瑙莫夫报道：仅仅在三月底的几天中，西德就已成立了几十处人民投票委员会，在许多城市和乡村中，已经举行了人民投票。参加投票的有百分之八十到百分之九十五都反对重新军国主义化和赞成在一九五一年内与统一的德国缔结和约。这个运动现在已席卷西德各地。很多知识分子、复员军人、归国侨民、教士、甚至大批旧军官都参加了这个运动。
