Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily

To the Editor:

    Having read the article "Yongding River Project Delayed" published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on April 15th, we hereby reply as follows:

    The Hebei Provincial Spring Water Conservancy Project Conference originally stipulated that general earthwork should commence on March 15th. However, due to incomplete organization of the labor force, the later season this year, and a shortage of technical personnel, most areas failed to commence on time. In light of this situation, at the first meeting of the Provincial Water Conservancy Spring Repair Project Committee, the commencement dates for various locations were re-established as follows: March 25th for the left bank of the Yongding River, April 1st for the right bank; March 25th for the Daqing River Diversion Channel (Liu Zijiu's letter incorrectly included the Xingaifang Diversion Channel project within the Yongding River project; the Xingaifang Diversion Channel is a Daqing River project).

    The Yongding River project plan was originally prepared by the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau. The bureau submitted the plan to our department in early March. The construction organization was hastily established. A large quantity of materials were procured on a temporary basis; however, through the efforts of the staff, most areas commenced on schedule. Beijing and Zhuozhou County both commenced on March 25th, and all other counties commenced before April 1st.

    The commencement date for the Daqing River Diversion Channel was delayed by four days. This was because detailed measurements were not possible during last year's planning due to limited capacity. Measurements taken this March revealed the need for recalculation (the original letter stated that a total of 450,000 cubic meters of earth were added, requiring 130,000 labor days to complete, which was an approximate estimate; in reality, only over 300,000 cubic meters of earth were added, and the change in soil extraction distance did not increase labor).

    We examine the reasons for this delay in commencement, the main ones being: insufficient planning in our work, poor communication between various parties, and the possibility of some areas experiencing laxity due to the large workload and limited number of cadres. Because the project requires tens of thousands of people to work, even a slight delay results in a significant loss. We will certainly pay attention to solving problems promptly in the future and avoid wasting manpower.

### 河北省人民政府水利厅  对永定河工程迟延开工的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　河北省人民政府水利厅
    对永定河工程迟延开工的答复编辑同志：
    看了人民日报四月十五日“读者来信”栏发表的“永定河工程迟延开工”一稿，我们特答复如下：
    河北省春季水利工程会议原规定一般土工应于三月十五日开工。但由于民工组织工作没有完全做好，今年节气较晚，以及技术干部缺乏等原因，大部地区都未能按时开工。根据这种情况，在本省水利春修工程委员会第一次会议上，再次确定各处开工的日期为：永定河左堤三月二十五日，右堤四月一日；大清河分洪道（刘子久同志的原信中把新盖房分洪道工程列在永定河工程内，是不对的，新盖房分洪道是大清河工程）三月二十五日。
    永定河工程计划原是华北水利工程局编造的。该局在三月初旬将计划交给本厅。施工组织仓促成立。大批物料，临时筹措；但经过员工们的努力，大部地区都如期开工了。北京市、涿县全是三月二十五日开的工，其余各县也全在四月一日以前开了工。
    大清河分洪道的开工日期比规定的迟延了四天。这是因为去年做计划时没有力量去详细测量，今年三月测量后，发现需要重新计算所致（原信说合计增加四十五万方土，需要十三万个工来完成，这是原先约略估计；实际上只增加了三十多万土方，同时因改变了取土距离，而没有增加人工）。
    我们检讨这次延误开工的原因，主要是：工作计划性不够，各方面联系较差，同时由于工作多，干部少，抓不紧的现象在某些地方也是可能存在的。因为工程需要成千上万的人去做，稍一耽误便损失很大。今后我们一定注意及时解决问题，不浪费人工。
              河北省人民政府水利厅
