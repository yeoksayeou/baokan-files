　　Project Incomplete, Lavish Entertaining and Gift-Giving Everywhere
    Taiyuan Yongmao Construction Company's Work Style Needs Improvement

Editor:

    The Taiyuan Public Yongmao Construction Company is very irresponsible in completing contracted projects, and its work style is also extremely improper.

    In the second half of last year, Yongmao Construction Company contracted for the Taiyuan Railway Bureau's building construction project of more than 4.7 million jin of rice, in the form of a commissioned project, extracting a 5% commission fee (design fee not included). The contract stipulated that the entire project should be completed by the end of January this year. But it has not been completed until now. In the completed projects, there are many quality problems that must be reworked. For example, most of the sewers in the high-level dormitory are blocked, the cement ground is frozen and bulging, and the newly built roof has collapsed.

    The company's work style is also very improper. Soon after the company contracted the Railway Bureau's project, it invited the director, section chiefs, supervisors, and other relevant engineering personnel from the Railway Bureau to eat at the most beautiful Zhengda Hotel in Taiyuan City, saying it was to "strengthen friendship." According to those who were invited, one meal cost more than one million yuan. Last winter, when the Xun Huisheng Peking Opera Troupe came to Taiyuan to perform, first-class tickets cost 20,000 yuan each. The company bought more than 60 tickets and gave them to relevant engineering personnel of the Railway Bureau. Recently, when the Mao Shilai Opera Troupe came to Taiyuan to perform, the company prepared to invite relevant engineering personnel to watch the show, but this time it was rejected. The company also gave cigarettes, pens, diaries, etc. to the guards at the construction site and the railway workers watching the water tower. But they were also rejected by the guards and workers. Last year, the company has always adopted a system of layer-by-layer subcontracting when hiring workers in the Railway Bureau's construction, contracting earthwork and carpentry to foremen, who then hired workers at low prices to exploit them. Now that the weather is warm and thawing, the company's project contracted by the Railway Bureau has not started for a long time. The reason is that last year's subcontracting system was investigated by the Municipal Labor Bureau, and this year it is not allowed to do so, which affected the start of construction. It is hoped that the company and relevant leading organs will check and correct the above events.

### 工程完成不了到处请客送礼  太原永茂建筑公司作风待改进

　　工程完成不了到处请客送礼
    太原永茂建筑公司作风待改进编辑同志：
    太原公营永茂建筑公司在完成承揽工程上很不负责任，作风也极不正派。
    去年下半年，永茂建筑公司以代办工程形式，承揽了太原铁路局四百七十多万斤米的建筑房屋工程，从中抽取百分之五的代办费（设计费不在内）。合同规定全部工程在今年一月底完成。但一直到现在还没竣工。在已经完成的工程中有很多质量太差，必须反工。如高级宿舍的下水道大部闭塞，洋灰地冻裂鼓起来了，新盖好的屋顶塌了。
    该公司在作风上也很不正派。该公司刚承揽路局工程不久，就请路局中有关工程的处长、科长、监工等在太原市最漂亮的正大饭店吃饭，说是“联络友谊”。据被请的人回来说一席饭就花一百余万元。去冬荀慧生京剧团来太原演出时，甲等票每张两万元。该公司购买了六十余张票，送给路局有关工程人员。日前毛世来剧团来太原演出，该公司又准备请有关工程人员看戏，但这次被拒绝了。该公司还给建筑现场的警卫人员和看水塔的铁路工人送纸烟、钢笔、日记本等。但也被警卫员和工人拒绝。该公司去年在路局建筑中雇用工人一直是采取层层转包制，把土木工包给把头，把头再低价招揽工人从中剥削。现在日暖开冻，该公司承揽路局的工程还迟迟未开工，原因是去年的转包制，被市劳动局查出来，今年不容许这样做，因此就影响了开工。上述事件，希望该公司及有关领导机关检查纠正。
