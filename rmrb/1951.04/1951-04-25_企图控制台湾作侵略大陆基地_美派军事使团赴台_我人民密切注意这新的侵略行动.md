　　Attempting to Control Taiwan as a Base for Aggression Against the Mainland
　  US Sends Military Mission to Taiwan
　  Our People Closely Watch This New Act of Aggression
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 24th] American imperialists are further tightening their military control over Taiwan, our country's territory, and are attempting to turn Taiwan into one of the bases for expanding their war of aggression in the East. The US State Department announced on the evening of the 20th that the United States would send a military mission of one hundred people to Taiwan. The head of the mission will be Chase, Chief of Staff of the Third Army at Fort McPherson, Georgia, USA. This measure by the American imperialists is an attempt to further and completely control Taiwan militarily, turning Taiwan into a base for aggression against our mainland, and using the Kuomintang bandit troops as tools of aggression. According to a United Press International dispatch from Taipei on the 21st, the mission's purpose "on the surface is to assist in the defense of Taiwan," but it does not ignore the possibility of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops "using the supplied weapons to attack the mainland." The Chinese people are closely watching this new act of aggression by the American imperialists against China and are determined to crush any conspiracy by the American aggressors.

　　企图控制台湾作侵略大陆基地
　  美派军事使团赴台
　  我人民密切注意这新的侵略行动
    【新华社二十四日讯】美帝国主义者正进一步从军事上控制我国领土台湾，并企图把台湾作为扩大在东方的侵略战争的基地之一。美国国务院二十日晚宣布，美国将派一个由一百人组成的军事使团赴台湾。该使团的团长由美国佐治亚州麦克佛逊堡第三军参谋长蔡斯充任。美帝国主义这一措施，是企图进一步在军事上完全控制台湾，把台湾变为侵略我国大陆的基地，把国民党匪军当作侵略的工具。据美联社台北二十一日电讯供认：该使团的目的“表面上是协助保卫台湾”，但并不忽视蒋匪军“利用供应的武器进攻大陆的可能性”。中国人民正密切注意美帝国主义者对中国这一新的侵略行动，并决心粉碎美国侵略者的任何阴谋。
