	Can the Masses Understand Such Proclamations? Editor:
	Recently, I have noticed that many of the proclamations and notices issued by the Anyang City Public Security Bureau and the Military Control Commission of Pingyuan Province contain words that are too far removed from the common vernacular. For example, "earnestly proclaim," "invite blame and offense," "to demonstrate clear warning," "spread rumors to mislead the masses," "those who steal and hide for personal gain," "do not bring trouble upon yourselves," "assist the wicked," and so on. Frankly speaking, even as a primary school teacher with a higher elementary education, I find these words somewhat difficult to understand, and some I simply don't understand at all. How can the general public understand them?
	Since proclamations and notices are written for the broad masses, why make the language so obscure and difficult to understand? I believe that the language of any proclamation or notice should strive to be simple and easy to understand, at least to the point where someone with a primary school education can understand it. I suggest that relevant authorities pay attention to this matter.

	Editor's Note: Comrade Wei Sheng's suggestion is very correct. In the old government, proclamations were routinely filled with official jargon to intimidate the people. Today, the purpose of proclamations issued by the People's Government is to inform the broad masses. Therefore, the language of proclamations should strive to be simple and easy to understand.

### 这样的布告群众能看懂吗？

专栏：来信摘要

  这样的布告群众能看懂吗？编辑同志：
    近来看到平原省安阳市公安局、军事管制委员会等机关出的布告和通告中，有不少文词太不大众化了。像：“剀切布告”、“致干咎戾”、“以昭炯戒”、“造谣蛊惑群众”、“窃匿自肥者”、“勿自贻误”、“助纣为虐”等等。老实说，我这个高小教员来看这些文词，也感到有些吃力，有的甚至根本就不懂；一般群众怎样能看懂呢？
    布告、通告既然是写给广大群众看的，为什么要把文词弄得这样艰深难解呢？我觉得无论什么布告、通告的文字，都应力求通俗易懂，起码要使有小学程度的人能看懂才好。我建议有关机关注意这件事。
            平原省安阳市第三完小  蔚生
    编者按：蔚生君提的意见很对。旧政府出布告，照例是玩弄官样文章，吓唬人民；今天，人民政府出布告，目的是让广大群众知晓，因此，布告的文字应力求通俗易懂。
