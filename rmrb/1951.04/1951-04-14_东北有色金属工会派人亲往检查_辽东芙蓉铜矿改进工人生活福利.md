　　Northeast Nonferrous Metals Trade Union Sends People to Inspect in Person
    Liaodong Furong Copper Mine Improves Workers' Living Welfare

To the Editors:

    The criticism in the "Letters from Readers" column of your newspaper on March 23rd, "Liaodong Province Furong Copper Mine Trade Union Does Not Care About Workers' Lives," is correct. Yang Baoshan, Minister of the Labor Protection Department of our Nonferrous Metals Trade Union Committee, personally went to the mine to investigate and assisted the factory's trade union in resolving the existing problems. Here is an account of what happened:

    In the past, the administrative side and trade union cadres of the Furong Copper Mine did not pay enough attention to labor protection and welfare work, resulting in many unresolved problems. The main reason was that the trade union and the administration were not aligned in their thinking and work steps. The trade union leaders did not go deep into the field to solve problems, but spent their time circling around in routine work. Instead of actively contacting the administration and mobilizing workers to improve workers' lives on the basis of good production, they competed with the administration for power. This shows that the trade union cadres in this factory lacked a correct understanding of trade union work.

    On the administrative side, they were also not good at relying on the strength of the trade union to mobilize workers and improve production; they only relied on administrative orders to carry out their work. They did not consider adopting the requests and suggestions made by trade union cadres and workers regarding labor protection, welfare, and improvement work, and even expressed dissatisfaction with those who made suggestions.

    This time, with the specific help of the CPC Zhuanghe County Committee and the Labor Protection Department of the Nonferrous Metals Trade Union Committee, the administrative and trade union cadres of the mine have recognized their past mistakes and made profound self-criticisms to each other. The problems that existed in workers' lives in the past have also been basically resolved. Such as:

    (1) In July 1950, some female workers who were selecting ore in the mine worked one to two hours of overtime every day, and did not receive wages for more than twenty days. It has now been decided to pay them retroactively.

    (2) In September of last year, the mine implemented a piece-rate wage system for some female workers who were selecting ore, stipulating a wage of 350 yuan for each box of ore selected. When wages were paid at the end of April, it was discovered that the wage standard was set too high, and the wages of individual female workers even exceeded those of skilled workers in the pit. However, the administrative leaders neither discussed it with the trade union in advance nor persuaded or explained it to the workers, but reduced the wage per box to 250 yuan. The workers were dissatisfied with this, and the administration even suppressed the workers by saying "If you don't want to do it, you'll be fired." After research, it has been decided that the wages for September will still be paid at 350 yuan per box.

    (3) In the past, female workers who took sick leave were not paid. It has now been decided that sick female workers should be treated in accordance with the labor insurance regulations. Wages that were not paid before will now be paid retroactively.

    (4) There was no firewood for the earth beds in the workers' collective dormitory; thirty to forty workers shared a washbasin, and the workers could not wash their faces after work and had to go to eat; the workers' dormitory was unsanitary, and there were no brooms for sweeping the floor or the beds; the health allowance fee was not handed over to the health canteen for three months last year; and the welfare coal for 1949 and 1950 was not distributed to the workers. Now there are improved methods: ten catties of firewood are issued to each bed in the dormitory every day; eight to ten workers share a washbasin; brooms for sweeping the floor and the beds are distributed; two new mats are issued to each bed every year; welfare coal is reissued to the workers; and health allowance is also handed over to the health canteen so that workers can eat nutritious food.

    (5) The more than 450 workers' dormitories in the mine are generally draughty and leaky, preventing employees from living in a warm room. The administration is now preparing to start repairing these dormitories in April. It has also been decided to build a bathhouse that can accommodate 30 to 40 people on the original basis. A part of the money will be drawn from the mine director's fund to build an amateur sanatorium; a part of the money will be taken from the labor insurance fund to purchase some beds and bedding. The barbershop stipulates that all trade union members are free of charge.

    (6) The problems existing in the workers' meals in the mine in the past were even more serious. Some workers said, "They only know to ask us to complete production tasks, but I haven't had a full meal since the Chinese New Year." Some workers complained every time they ate. It has now been decided to allocate the two administrative horse-drawn carts to the workers' canteen to pull vegetables and firewood to reduce transportation costs in food purchases. We also suggest that the administration send someone to be responsible for managing the food.

### 东北有色金属工会派人亲往检查  辽东芙蓉铜矿改进工人生活福利

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　东北有色金属工会派人亲往检查
    辽东芙蓉铜矿改进工人生活福利编辑同志：
    贵报三月二十三日《读者来信》栏刊登《辽东省芙蓉铜矿工会不关心工人生活》的批评是正确的。我们有色金属工会委员会劳动保护部部长杨宝善同志曾亲到该矿进行了解，并协助该厂工会对存在的问题作了解决。现将经过告诉你们：
    芙蓉铜矿的行政方面和工会干部过去对劳动保护和福利工作不够重视，以致很多问题得不到解决。主要原因是：工会和行政在思想与工作步骤上不一致。工会领导干部不深入现场解决问题，整天在事务工作中打圈子，他们不是主动和行政取得联系，发动职工，在搞好生产的基础上，改善工人生活，相反的，是和行政互相争夺职权。这说明该厂工会干部对工会工作缺乏正确的认识。
    在行政方面，也不善于依靠工会的力量，来发动工人，搞好生产；只凭行政命令来搞工作；对工会干部及工人所提的有关劳动保护、福利及改进工作的要求和建议，不考虑采纳，甚至对提意见的人表示不满。
    这次在中共庄河县委及有色金属工会委员会劳动保护部的具体帮助下，该矿行政和工会干部都认识到过去的错误，并相互作了深刻的检讨。过去工人生活中所存在的问题，也已经基本上求得解决。如：
    （一）一九五○年七月间，该矿选矿石的女工有的每天延长工作一至两小时，共有二十多天没有发工资。现已决定补发。
    （二）去年九月，该矿对一部分选矿石的女工实行计件工资制，规订每选一箱矿石工资三百五十元。到四月底发工资时，发现工资标准订的过高，个别女工的工资竟超过了坑里的熟练工人。但行政领导干部事先既未与工会商讨，也未向工人进行说服解释，就将每箱工资降低到二百五十元。工人对此不满，行政上还以“不干就解雇”来压制工人。现经研究，已决定九月份工资仍按三百五十元一箱发给。
    （三）过去对女工因病请假的，不发工资。现在已决定，女工有病应按劳动保险条例处理。以前未发工资的，现在补发。
    （四）工人集体宿舍土炕没柴火烧；三四十个工人共用一个洗脸盆，工友下班无法洗脸，就得去吃饭；工人宿舍里不卫生，连扫地扫炕的扫把都没有；去年有三个月未将保健津贴费交给保健食堂；一九四九年和一九五○年的福利煤也没有发给工人等问题，现在都有了改进办法：宿舍里每个炕每天发给十斤柴火；八个到十个工人共用一个洗脸盆；发给扫地扫炕的扫把；每个炕每年发两床新席子；福利煤补发给工人；保健津贴也交给了保健食堂，让工人吃营养的食物。
    （五）该矿四百五十多间工人宿舍，普遍透风漏雨，使职工得不到一个暖和屋子住。现在行政上已准备在四月间动工修理这些宿舍。并决定在原有的基础上修造一个能容三四十个人的洗澡塘。由矿长基金内抽一部分钱，修业余休养所；由劳动保险基金拿一部分钱，购置一部分床铺和被褥。理发室并规定凡工会会员一律不收费。
    （六）该矿过去在工人伙食上存在的问题更严重。有些工人说“只知道叫我们完成生产任务，可是我自打过年就没有吃过一顿饱饭。”有些工人每逢吃饭就发牢骚。现在已决定把行政上的二辆马车拨给工人食堂拉菜拉柴，以减少伙食采购中的运费开支。我们并建议行政派专人负责管理伙食。
