Huang Huoqing's Opening Speech at the Tianjin Municipal and District People's Representatives Enlarged Meeting

Comrades, the enlarged meeting of representatives from all walks of life in the city being held today includes representatives from all sectors of the city, members of district consultation committees, members of various democratic parties, representatives of mass organizations, and representatives of victimized masses.

The main purpose of the meeting is to report on and discuss the punishment of counter-revolutionary criminals and to expose their counter-revolutionary crimes.

Recently, based on two years of thorough investigation and the assistance and demands of the broad masses of people, the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested a large number of special agents, traitors, local bullies, and reactionary secret society leaders who have committed heinous crimes. This is a great victory in the struggle against the enemy since the liberation of Tianjin! (Applause) These counter-revolutionary elements have consistently stood with the imperialist Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, oppressing the people and committing all kinds of evil deeds. Countless people have suffered their devastation and trampling, leading to broken families, deaths, and separations. After liberation, they continued to harbor extreme hostility towards the victorious people, opposing the people in every way, and remained counter-revolutionary to the end. They opposed the revolutionary great unity of the people from all walks of life, engaging in incitement and discord. They hated the increasingly prosperous economic construction, setting fire to factories and warehouses, and sabotaging machinery. They especially resented the freedom and happiness that our workers and other working people have gained in their political, economic, and cultural lives, and dreamed of restoring their reactionary rule.

Now, the Municipal People's Government has arrested all the deadly enemies of the people and imposed severe sanctions on them (warm applause), which is entirely an action representing the interests of the people and meeting the demands of the people. We firmly support the government's wise measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and the conference should celebrate this great victory in the struggle against the enemy. (Applause) Workers and victimized people throughout the city are holding meetings everywhere to accuse special agents and local bullies of their crimes. For example, textile factories, Tianjin Steel Plant, machine factories, Yizhong Tobacco Factory, and Rubber Branch Factory, etc., all unanimously believe that these bad eggs should have been arrested long ago. The government has sharp eyes and has not arrested a single wrong person. In the past, they enjoyed themselves, but now it's our turn to feel good. (Applause) When the tram factory arrested Xue Fuzhen and other "Four King Kongs," workers greeted each other with congratulations. When the Huayang Tobacco Factory arrested Luo Yun, the chairman of the puppet trade union and member of the bandit city party committee, all the workers immediately surrounded the public security personnel to accuse him. After the Fuxing Flour Mill arrested the special agent, both labor and management unanimously said that production competition would definitely improve in the future. The family committee of the No. 5 Cotton Mill decided that each person would publicize to eight households. This all shows that our workers unanimously support this measure of the government.

The general public also unanimously supports it. Grandma Yao, who assisted the government in capturing special agents, is their representative (applause). They have suggested to the government that the ringleaders of these counter-revolutionaries must be severely punished and should not be easily released to harm people again. There are also a few people who do not understand the policy and raise questions or concerns. To make everyone more clear, today's meeting is specially held, and Mayors Huang and Xu are invited to report to the conference and the victimized people will accuse the counter-revolutionaries of their criminal facts. It is also hoped that the representatives attending the meeting will discuss how to punish these counter-revolutionary elements. Our government is a government of broad people's democracy and dictatorship over counter-revolutionary elements. Today's meeting is also a meeting of people's democratic dictatorship. Now, please Director Xu report.

　　在天津市市、区各界人民代表扩大会议上       
    黄火青的开幕词
    今天召开的全市各界人民代表扩大会，到会的有全市各界代表，各区协商委员，各民主党派的党员，各群众团体的代表及被害群众代表。
    大会主要是报告讨论惩治反革命罪犯和控诉反革命的罪行。
    最近市公安局根据两年来的周密调查与广大人民的协助和要求，逮捕了一大批罪大恶极的特务、汉奸、恶霸和反动会门头子。这是天津解放以来，在对敌斗争中一次伟大胜利。（鼓掌）这些反革命分子，过去一贯站在帝国主义蒋介石匪帮一起，欺压人民无恶不作，不知有多少人受他们的摧残蹂躏，家破人亡妻子离散，牺牲许多人命。解放后他们对待胜利了的人民仍然抱着极端仇视的态度，处处与人民为敌，反革命到底，他们反对各界人民革命的大团结，进行挑拨离间，他们仇视日益繁荣的经济建设，纵火烧毁工厂仓库，破坏机器，他们特别对我们工人和其他劳动人民在政治上经济文化生活上所得的自由和幸福，表示憎恨，幻想恢复其反动统治。
    现在市人民政府把人民死敌统统抓起来予以严厉的制裁，（热烈鼓掌）完全是代表人民利益和符合人民要求的行动。我们坚决拥护政府镇压反革命的贤明措施，大会应庆祝这次对敌斗争的伟大胜利。（鼓掌）全市职工和被害人民到处开会控诉特务恶霸罪行，像纺织各厂、天津钢厂、机器厂、颐中烟厂、橡胶分厂等，都一致认为这些坏蛋早就应该抓起来，政府眼睛真亮，一个也未抓错，过去他们吃喝顺气，现在该咱们顺气。（鼓掌）电车厂抓走了薛福珍等四大金刚，工人见面互相道喜；华洋烟厂逮捕伪工会理事长匪市党部委员罗云时，全体工人立刻向公安人员围起控诉；福兴面粉厂把特务抓走，劳资双方异口同声说今后生产竞赛一定可以搞好；棉纺五厂的家属委员会决定每人宣传八家居民。这都说明咱工人们是一致拥护政府这一措施。
    一般市民也是一致拥护的，协助政府捉特务的姚大娘是其代表，（鼓掌）他们纷纷建议政府对这些反革命首恶分子必须严厉惩办，不要轻易把他们又放出来害人。也有少数不了解政策的人，提出疑问或顾虑，为使大家更清楚了解，特召开今天的大会，请黄、许二市长向大会报告及被害人民控诉反革命罪恶事实，并希到会代表讨论如何惩治这些反革命分子。我们的政府是广大人民民主对反革命分子专政的政府，今天大会也是人民民主专政的大会，下面请许兼局长报告。
