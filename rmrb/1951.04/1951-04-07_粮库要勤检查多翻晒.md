　　Grain Depots Should Be Frequently Inspected and Sunned
　　To the Editor:
　　When we in Lingling County collected the public grain last autumn, it was during the autumn rainy season, and the moisture content of the grain was high. To prevent the public grain from rotting, according to the instructions of the Hunan Provincial Grain Bureau, we promptly mobilized the cadres of each depot to carry out the work of shifting and sunning the grain. In general, the grain depots have mostly completed the grain protection work. However, some cadres are ideologically paralyzed, believing that the grain has only been in storage for a short time (one month to one and a half months) and are unwilling to shift it. For example, Zhu Shaohua, the director of the Huangximiao Grain Depot, had this idea. However, after we insisted that the depot shift the grain, we found that the grain at the bottom of some depots had already begun to heat up. If the shifting and sunning were delayed, there would be a danger of mold and insect infestation. In order to better protect the people's property, we hope that comrades working in grain depots everywhere will improve their sense of responsibility, overcome complacency, inspect at any time, and diligently shift and sun the grain.

### 粮库要勤检查多翻晒

　　粮库要勤检查多翻晒编辑同志：
    我们零陵县去年秋征公粮入库时，正值秋雨季节，粮食的含水量较大。为防止公粮霉烂，根据湖南省粮食局的指示，我们及时地发动了各库干部进行倒仓翻晒工作。一般说，各粮库大都完成了护粮工作。但是有些干部思想麻痹，认为粮食入库时间尚短（一个月至一个半月），不愿翻仓。如黄溪庙粮库主任朱绍华就有这种想法。但经我们坚持要该仓倒仓后，发现有的仓底存粮已开始发热，如延迟翻晒，就有霉烂生虫的危险。为了更好地保管人民财产，我们希望各地粮仓工作同志们要提高责任心，克服麻痹思想，随时检查，勤于翻晒。
