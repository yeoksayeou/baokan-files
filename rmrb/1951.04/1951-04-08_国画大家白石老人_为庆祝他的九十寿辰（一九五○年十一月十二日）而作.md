Grand Master of Chinese Painting, Old Man Baishi
　  ——In Celebration of His Ninetieth Birthday (November 12, 1950)
　　Li Keran
    At a certain exhibition, in a large hall, nearly a hundred Chinese paintings were hanging. I walked in and was immediately drawn to Mr. Qi Baishi's works. These works, with their vivid expressions and magnificent freshness, made me feel the boundless spirit of our Chinese nation and its great creative spirit. Although the works next to them were large in size and heavy in color, they seemed to lack vitality and appeared dull in comparison.
    Old Man Baishi's paintings are not only highly regarded by some artists and connoisseurs, but also have a wide following of enthusiasts. Since liberation, our government has shown great care for this old artist, and the Central Academy of Fine Arts has appointed him as an honorary professor. Many progressive artists not only express their respect for him but also praise his works. Why is it that Qi Baishi can receive such glory and respect? This is entirely due to his achievements and contributions in art; and these achievements and contributions are closely related to his lifelong spirit of perseverance and unyielding struggle.
    Old Man Baishi was born into a poor peasant family in Xingdoutang, a rural area of Xiangtan, Hunan. As a child, he herded cattle and gathered firewood. At the age of eight, his mother used the money she earned from threshing rice to pay for him to study for half a year. At eleven, he learned to plow the fields, but because he was young and physically weak, he switched to carpentry. First, he was an ordinary carpenter, then a decorative woodworker. After fifteen years, he changed his profession again to a portrait painter. It was not until he was twenty-seven that he met local scholars and celebrities and asked them to teach him reading, poetry, seal carving, and painting. During this period, his poverty was terrible: he and his wife often drank water to stave off hunger. In the evenings, they had no money to buy oil, so they used pine firewood as lamps. When his wife was about to give birth, she still had to go to the mountains to chop firewood as usual, unable to bear the burden, crawling home on her hands. In such a living environment, he still persevered in his self-study. As a carpenter, he often walked dozens of miles to the employer's house to work, carrying a small tung oil can, paper, and brushes in his tool basket. After a day's work, he would light the lamp and practice painting until late at night. When he practiced seal carving, he ground and carved the stone repeatedly, soaking it in water, filling the room with mud. Once, the knife pierced his finger, and he lost so much blood that he fainted, but none of these things could hinder his determination to move forward.
    Old Man Baishi lived an extremely simple and plain life. He got up early every day and painted and carved seals tirelessly. To avoid being disturbed, he often locked the front door. To save time, he composed poetry while sleeping and riding in cars. He devoted all his life force to art. He worked hard on art, persevered, and never stopped. It is said that he did not paint for ten days when his mother passed away, which was the only time in his life. Therefore, the number of paintings he has produced over the decades is truly countless. Our art history records the diligence of the ancients with the story of "The Pool Water Turning Black." Old Man Baishi, a man of great talent, also inherited the steadfast spirit of his predecessors and paid a great price. His achievements are by no means accidental.
    When we study Old Man Baishi's works, we must first remember that he is already ninety years old. In his youth, the artistic environment in China was very different from what it is now. At that time, Chinese painting, along with the dilapidated feudal society, had fallen into the most corrupt and decadent stage. The representative writers of formalism, the Four Wangs (Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Wang Yuanqi, and Wang Hui), although long dead, their successors, the so-called orthodox painters, were all walking the dead end of "not daring to make a single stroke without referring to the ancients." They worshipped the ancients but uncritically accepted their experience, binding themselves tightly with the ancient methods like a rope, making their works lifeless and even completely devoid of life. Another group of wild literati painters, inheriting the traditions of the Ming loyalist painters and the Yangzhou painters, opposed the formalism of rigidly adhering to the old methods and advocated creation. However, most of them placed the source of creation in their personal subjective thoughts, and therefore their works still failed to achieve a true expression and lost the appreciation of the masses. Old Man Baishi grew up in such an artistic environment, and he did not approve of the formalists' slavish imitation of the ancients. His artistic thought, in the past, had leaned towards these wild literati painters. In his works, we can indeed see that he accepted certain strengths of the Ming loyalist painters and the Yangzhou painters of the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods. However, his acceptance was critical and developmental. He accepted these writers' spirit of opposing the rigid adherence to the old methods and advocating creation; he accepted their expressive power in brush and ink, but in creation, he corrected the errors arising from subjectivity. In his recently written autobiography, there are these words: "After the age of twenty, I abandoned the axe and chisel to study portraiture, writing true likenesses of myriad insects and conveying the spirit of hundreds of birds. Only the dragon among the scaled creatures, I have never seen, so I cannot dare to do it boldly." Depicting without relying on fantasy, "conveying the spirit" and "writing true likenesses" both start from objective objects, which allowed the old man to find a true source in creation. Before the age of sixty, when the old man painted grass and insects, he kept many insects in his house. When painting shrimp, he often kept two live shrimp in his brush-washing pot. He has a collection of landscape paintings called "Borrowing the Mountain Hall," which is the result of his five trips to famous mountains and scenic spots in the southwest after the age of forty. Before the Spring Festival this year, Mr. Lao She selected four lines of Su Manshu's poems and asked the old man to paint them. One line was: "Banana leaves curl and embrace autumn flowers." The old man, not familiar with the curling of banana leaves, and with no real objects to refer to in the cold winter, asked people whether the curling of banana leaves was from left to right or from right to left. Without getting a correct answer, he did not paint the curled leaves. From this small example, we can see the importance the old man attached to the reality of objects in creation.
    Old Man Baishi's paintings include grass and insects that are so detailed that every hair is visible, and shrimp and crabs that are so rough that they are rendered with only a few strokes. Whether rough or fine, both equally express things to the point of achieving a combination of form and spirit. Look at the grass and insects painted by the old man, those two sensitive antennae, giving the feeling of moving with a touch. This is definitely not something that can be done simply by copying dead specimens. Looking at the ink crabs he paints, the realistic state of the movement of the claws is something that no subjectivist can dream of creating out of thin air. The old man once told me that his own paintings of crabs are easily distinguishable from the fake ones; the legs of his crabs are full and flat on the surface, while the fake ones are often round; his crabs walk sideways, while the fake ones often crawl forward like spiders, completely losing the characteristics of the crab. From this, we can know how profound the old man's understanding and expression of objects are. The chicks he paints not only show the down on their bodies, but also the lovely childishness of the small animals. The bees he paints, with their wings fluttering, truly seem to make you hear the buzzing sound. ... Faced with these vivid images, I think anyone will admit that the old man's works are realistic. However, if we compare the images in his paintings with real objects, we will definitely feel that there is a considerable distance between the two. The images on the screen have all been refined, purified of impurities, and processed. He wrote this on his works: "Painting should be between likeness and unlikeness. Too much likeness is flattering vulgarity; unlikeness is deceiving the world." Works that are completely similar in form and color to please vulgar people are not taken by him, and the "casual strokes, not seeking likeness" of the literati ink play are also accused of deceiving the world. His creation starts from objective things, casts the real object with thoughts and feelings, and then expresses it with his powerful brush and ink. Therefore, his works combine form and spirit, showing healthy characteristics, sweeping away the subjective biases and the morbid style of despising images in the literati paintings of the time.
    Old Man Baishi's works have another characteristic, which is their bright colors, full of the vigor of life. We know that in Chinese painting, after the Yuan Dynasty, due to the negative thinking of the literati painters, the bright colors gradually faded from the screen, and the bleak and decadent mood gradually increased. As early as the Song Dynasty, there were painters who wrote such verses: "Rainy smoke village, snowy mountain, easy to see but difficult to paint. Knowing early that it will not enter the eyes of the people, buy more rouge to paint peonies!" Rain and snow scenes are painted purely with light ink without using color, because they are not appreciated by the masses, which made the author utter lamenting verses. After the Yuan Dynasty, landscape painters mostly liked to use only a little light ochre in color, called "light Jiang." The mood of the screen is also considered "cold and detached" and "bitter" as high. This even led later painters to produce a very abnormal view: that profound art can only express sadness and sorrow, and that bright colors are incompatible with noble painting styles. This not only distanced Chinese painting from the masses but also made its path of development increasingly narrow. However, in the works of Old Man Baishi, these biased morbidities have been quite corrected. The morning glories he paints are extremely red and vibrant, as if they have received a night of sweet dew, welcoming the morning sun, thriving, and making people feel refreshed. In the past, I have seen him paint a "Lotus and Kingfisher" and a "Red Plum and Shoudai," which were extremely colorful and gorgeous. However, this did not lower the painting style. The old man's paintings not only express joyful and vigorous emotions in terms of color and style but also like to directly use some auspicious folk themes, such as "great luck and great profit," "joy on the eyebrows," etc. These themes, considered "vulgar" by eccentric literati painters, can equally become highly artistic works in his hands. This is also a major factor in why his works can win the love of more people.
    Due to Old Man Baishi's creative method, and due to his decades of hard and persistent work, his works have not only broken the shackles of the rigid old methods of the formalists but also corrected the "not seeking likeness" shortcomings of literati paintings; at the same time, he has advanced the techniques of ink painting from the original stage, endowing it with a higher degree of expressiveness. We see that any ordinary subject matter, in the hands of the old man, can "turn decay into magic," as if reaching the point of "turning stone into gold." I remember once telling a friend in the art world how wonderful the cherries painted by the old man were. This friend said suspiciously: "Cherries have very little change in shape and color, how can they be made into beautiful works?" When he saw the original painting, the red, juicy particles, and the complexly changing branches, plus the effect formed by the decorative fruit plate, he not only immediately dispelled his initial doubts but also made him linger in front of the painting, unwilling to leave. I remember when I first arrived in Beijing, the first time I saw the old man painting shrimp, I was amazed by the production in ten minutes. He paints a shrimp as easily as an ordinary person writes a word, with the brushstrokes, volume, texture, movement, and spirit, all being present, and as a result, the transparent shrimp swimming in the water appears vividly on the paper. Can you not marvel at his expressive power of ink painting?
    Why was it that Old Man Baishi, growing up in such a decadent artistic environment, was able to walk on a relatively healthy and correct path, thus improving the expressive power of ink painting? I think that in addition to its social factors at the time, there is one point that cannot be ignored, and that is his simple qualities and the great influence of folk art on his works. As mentioned earlier, the old man had been a decorative carpenter for a long time. It is said that the flower panels he carved were "carved to the point of being divine." After the age of twenty, he also worked as a portrait painter. The portraits he painted not only conveyed spirit but also had the superb skill of expressing the patterns of robes and gowns revealed through gauze clothing, which shows that his realistic skills were very high. Because he was originally a folk artist, he was able to naturally bring the healthy and realistic characteristics of folk art into his art, this is one point. Although Old Man Baishi entered the ranks of the literati after the age of forty and became a professional artist, he has always maintained the noble qualities of simple working people. He never sought fame and fortune, never used means, and relied entirely on his own genius and labor to create, relying on the support and love of admirers. Therefore, his works are naturally directly and closely connected with a part of the mass admirers, and naturally have to take care of their requirements and satisfy their requirements. The requirements of general admirers and the improvement and development of art originally had a long and deep contradiction in old Chinese painting, but Old Man Baishi was able to overcome it slowly, and I think this achievement is commendable.
    Art was originally created for the masses, but for hundreds of years, old Chinese painting has been playing out the tragedy of moving away from the masses. Hundreds and thousands of painters are sighing: "Highbrow art, a song with few listeners!" But they do not know how to deeply excavate the root of this contradiction. Old Man Baishi, in such an artistic environment, was uniquely able to approach the appreciation of the masses through diligent self-study and genius creation. He won the love of a wider range of admirers, which cannot but make us admire him! Of course, his creations from the past were limited by the times, and the themes he expressed had certain limitations, so his masses also had a certain scope. But from his works, we can at least recognize that: ink painting in Chinese painting can be realistic; it can use bright colors; it can express joyful and upward emotions; and it has a considerable degree of expressiveness. He has an original style, which is very different from the general so-called literati painting. This plays a role in opening up a broad and upright path in the development and creation of our new Chinese painting techniques; and it provides valuable and rich nourishment. I think this is Old Man Baishi's major contribution to our art and an indelible achievement in art history. (Attached pictures)

　　国画大家白石老人
　  ——为庆祝他的九十寿辰（一九五○年十一月十二日）而作
　　李可染
    在某次展览会上，一间宽大的厅堂里，挂着将近百十幅的国画。我走了进去，首先被齐白石先生的作品吸引住。这些作品，神态生动，壮丽清新，使我感到了我们中华民族的磅礴气魄，和伟大的创造精神。尽管旁边的作品，幅面很大，颜色浓重，但相形之下，就似乎生气不足，显得灰暗。
    白石老人的画，不仅为一些美术家、鉴赏家所推重，同时也拥有较为广大的爱好者。解放以后，我们的政府对于这位老艺术家爱护备至，中央美术学院并聘他为名誉教授。不少的进步美术家不仅对他表示敬重，并且同样称扬他的作品。为什么齐白石能得到这样的光荣和尊敬呢，这完全由于他在美术上的成就和贡献；而这些成就和贡献，又与他一生坚韧不屈的奋斗精神有着密切的关系。
    白石老人生长在湖南湘潭乡间星斗塘地方一个贫农的家里。幼年放牛拾柴。八岁时，他的母亲把椎稻草上剩余谷粒换得钱，积存下来，供他读了半年书。十一岁学犁田，因为幼小体力不支，改习木工。先为普通木匠，后作雕花细工。十五年后又改业画像的画工。到了二十七岁才结识当地文人名流，向他们请教读书，作诗，刻印，绘画。在这一时期他的穷困是可怕的：他同夫人常在饥饿时饮水当饭。晚间无钱买油，点松柴作灯。他的夫人将届分娩，还要照常到山上砍柴，不堪负荷，用手爬行回家。处在这样的生活环境下，他仍然坚韧不屈地进行他的自学。作木匠时，常远走数十里到雇主家里作工，在提着的工具篮子里他放着小小桐油罐子和纸笔，一天工作完毕，便在晚间点灯习画，至深夜不息。他练习刻印时，印石磨了又刻，刻了又磨，磨石醮水，弄得满屋尽成泥塘。有一次刀穿手指，流血过多，人都晕了过去，然而这些都不足阻挠他前进的决心。
    白石老人一生过着极其质朴单纯的生活。每天凌晨即起，作画刻印不知劳累。为了怕人纷扰，常把大门关锁。为了珍惜时间，睡觉及坐车时做诗。他把整个的生命力量都献给了艺术。他对艺术所下工夫，坚忍持久，从不间断。据说他母亲逝世时有十天未曾作画，这在他生平是仅有的事。因之他数十年来作画之多，真是难以数计。我们的美术史上，记载古人用功勤苦的情形，有《池水尽黑》的故事。白石老人是个有绝大天才的人，在这一点上也承继了先贤的坚毅精神，付出了绝大的代价，他的成就岂是偶然。
    我们研究白石老人的作品，首先不能忘记他已届九十岁的高龄，在他少壮的年代，中国的艺术环境同现在是大不相同。那时的中国画，已随着残破的封建社会，陷到最为腐朽颓废的阶段。公式主义的代表作家四王（王时敏、王鉴、王原祁、王翚虽早已死去，然而他们的承继者，所谓正统派画家，都是走着“离开古人不敢着一笔”的绝路。他们崇拜古人，却不善批评地接受古人的经验，而把古人的成法像一条绳子似的，把自己牢牢捆缚，弄得作品奄奄一息，甚至完全丧失了生命。另外一派在野的文人画家，承继了明遗民画家，及扬州诸画家的传统，反对公式主义者的死守成法，主张创造。然而他们大半又把创作的源泉，寄托在个人的主观思想里，因而他们的作品仍然得不到真实的表现，而且失去了群众的欣赏。白石老人生长在这样的艺术环境里，他不赞成公式主义者死摹古人的作品。他的艺术思想，过去是曾经倾向于这些在野的文人画家的。我们在他的作品里，确也可以看出他是接受了明遗民画家，及乾嘉间扬州诸画家的某些特长。然而他的接受是有批判的，同时是有发展的。他接受了这些作家的反对死守成法及主张创造的精神；接受了他们笔墨上的表现力，但在创造上却矫正了从主观出发的错误。在他最近自写的小传里有这样的话：“二十岁后，弃斧斤学画像，为万虫写照，百鸟传神。只有鳞虫中之龙，未曾见过，不能大胆敢为也。”描写不根据空想，“传神”“写照”都从客观物象出发，这样就使老人在创作上找到了真实的源泉。老人六十岁前画草虫时，家里就养了很多的虫子。画虾，经常在笔洗里放着两只活虾。他有一部借山馆图（山水画），就是他四十岁后，五次出游西南各名山胜迹的成果。今年春节前，老舍先生选了四句苏曼殊的诗，请老人作画。内中有一句是：“芭蕉叶卷抱秋花”，老人因为不熟芭蕉叶卷的情形，时当严冬，又无实物可作参证，逢人便问芭蕉的卷叶是从左到右，还是从右到左的。没有得到正确的答案，结果便没有画上卷叶。由此小小事例，可知老人在创作上对物象的真实，是抱着何等重视的态度。
    白石老人的画，有细到纤毫毕现的草虫，有粗到了了几笔的虾蟹。不管是粗是细，同样的都表现事物达到了形神兼备的境地，试看老人画的草虫，那两根敏锐的触须，真有一触即动的感觉。这决不是仅仅靠着摹写死的标本所能办得到的。再看他画的墨蟹，那脚爪活动的真实状态，更不是主观主义者凭空臆造所能梦见。老人曾告诉我说，他自己画的螃蟹，与那些伪作的容易分辨；他画的蟹腿饱满而表面扁平，伪作往往是滚圆的；他画螃蟹是横行的，伪作常是蜘蛛似的向前爬行，这样就完全失去了蟹的特性。由此可知老人对物象的认识和表现又是何等的深刻。他画的小鸡，不仅画出身上的茸毛，而且画出了小动物可爱的稚气。画的蜜蜂，那翅膀飞动，真仿佛要叫你听到了嗡嗡的声音。……对着这些生动的形象，我想任何人都会承认老人的作品是写实的。然而我们若把他画上的形象与真实物象对比，又一定会感到这二者之间有着相当的距离，那画面上的形象，都是经过千锤百炼，脱净了渣滓加过工的。他在作品上题过这样的话：“作画要在似与不似之间。太似为媚俗；不似为欺世。”那种毫无创造，完全以形色酷似来讨好庸俗人的作品既为他所不取，同样“逸笔草草，不求形似”的文人墨戏也责之为欺世。他的创作，从客观事物出发，把真实对象加以思想感情的铸造，而后用他有力的笔墨表现出来。因此他的作品形神兼备，显示出健康的特色，一扫当时文人画的主观偏颇，轻视形象的病态作风。
    白石老人的作品，还有另一个特色，就是色彩艳丽，充满了生命的朝气。我们知道中国画在元朝以后，由于士大夫画家思想的消极，鲜艳的色彩便一天一天地在画面上衰退，惨淡颓废的情调一天一天地在画面上增长。早在宋朝就有画家写出了这样的诗句：“雨里烟村雪里山，看时容易画时难。早知不入时人眼，多买胭脂画牡丹！”雨景雪景都是不用色彩纯用淡墨画成，因为不为群众所欣赏，才使作者发出了感喟诗句。元朝以后的山水，画家在色彩上大多只喜欢使用一点淡淡的赭石，名曰“浅绛”。画面的情调也以“冷逸”“苦涩”为高。这样甚至使以后的画家产生一种极不正常的看法：认为高深的艺术，只能表现苦闷哀愁，鲜艳的色彩与高尚的画格不能相容。这样不仅使国画远离了群众，同时也使它发展的道途日益窄狭。但是在白石老人的作品上，却相当的矫正了这些偏颇的病态。他画的牵牛花，红艳到了顶点，真仿佛受了一夜甘露，迎着朝阳，欣欣向荣，使人看了精神为之振奋。过去曾见他画过一幅《莲花翠鸟》及一幅《红梅寿带》，五色缤纷，绚灿极了。然而并未因此就降低了画格。老人的画，不仅在色彩上作风上表现出欣快峥嵘的情绪，同时还欢喜直接使用一些民间吉祥的题材，如“大吉大利”“喜上眉梢”等等，这些为怪癖的士大夫画家认为“俗”的题材，一到了他的笔下，同样的能成为高度的艺术品。他的作品所以能博得较多人的喜爱，这实也是一个主要的因素。
    由于白石老人的这种创作方法，由于他数十年坚苦持久的工力，在他的作品成就上，不仅打破了公式主义者死硬成法的束缚，并且矫正了文人画“不求形似”的缺失；同时把水墨画的技法，从原有阶段向前推进了一步，使它富有了更高度的表现力。我们看任何平凡的题材，到了老人手里，就能“化朽腐为神奇”，真仿佛到了“点石成金”的程度。记得有一次，我告诉一位美术界的朋友说老人画的樱桃是如何的美妙。这位朋友怀疑地说：“樱桃形色都极少变化，如何能制成美好的作品？”及至看见了原画，那红艳的饱含液汁的颗粒，及综错变化的枝梗，加上装饰风的果盘所形成的效果，不仅马上打消了他最初的怀疑，并且使他留恋在画前不肯离去。记得我初到北京，第一次看老人作虾，在十几分钟的制作中，使我感到惊异。他画一只虾，其容易就像普通人写一个字，笔墨过处，体积，质感，动作，神气，应有尽有，结果游泳在水里透明体的虾子，栩栩如生地出现在纸上了。这样你能不惊叹他水墨画的表现力吗？
    为什么白石老人生长在那样颓废的艺术环境里，而能走向比较健康正确的道路，因而提高了水墨画的表现力呢？我认为这除了有它当时社会的因素外，还有一点是不容忽视的，这就是他朴素的品质，和民间艺术对他作品的重大影响。前边已经说过，老人曾做过不少时期的雕花木匠。据说他雕的花板是“刻画入神”的。二十岁后又做过画像的画工，他画的人像不仅能传达神气，而且有表现从纱衣透露出袍褂花纹的绝技，可知他的写实技巧是很高明的。因为原来是民间艺人，所以能很自然地把民间艺术健康写实的特色，带到他的艺术里来，这是一点。白石老人四十岁后，虽然入了士大夫之林，成了专业的艺术家，但他一直保持着质朴劳动人民的高贵品质，一生不会沽名钓誉，不知使用手段，一切全靠自己天才的劳动创造，靠着欣赏者的拥护爱戴。因之他的作品，自然就与一部分群众欣赏者有着直接密切的联系，自然就得照顾到他们的要求，满足他们的要求。一般欣赏者的要求与艺术的提高发展，在过去旧国画中本存在着很久很深的矛盾，白石老人却能因此慢慢把它克服了，我认为这种成就是难能可贵的。
    艺术原为群众而创造，而旧国画数百年来，却演着远离群众的悲剧。成百成千的画家都在叹息着：“阳春白雪，曲高和寡”！却不知深入地挖掘这矛盾的根源。白石老人处在这样的艺术环境里，独能以坚苦自学，天才创造，接近了群众的欣赏。博得较广大的欣赏者的爱戴，这不能不使我们惊佩！当然他从来的创作，受了时代的限制，所表现的题材，有一定的限制性，因之他的群众，也就有了一定的范围。但我们从他的作品中至少可以认识到：国画中的水墨画可以写实；可以使用艳丽的色彩；可以表现欣悦向上的情感；并且它具有相当高度的表现力。他具有独创性的风格，和一般所谓文人画很不相同。这在我们新国画技法的发展和创造上，具有开启宽广平正的道路的作用；给予了宝贵而又丰富的滋养。我认为这是白石老人在我们美术上的重大贡献，也是他在美术史上不可磨灭的成就。（附图片）
