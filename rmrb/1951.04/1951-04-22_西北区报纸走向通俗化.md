　　Editor's note: This article reports the results of the Northwest Region newspaper work conference, which is worth the serious attention of newspaper workers in other regions. This conference conducted an in-depth review of the shortcomings of newspapers in the Northwest Region, which were not sufficiently popular and mass-oriented. These shortcomings can be found to varying degrees in many newspapers in other regions as well. It is essential that local newspapers at all levels move towards popularization as needed. Some newspaper workers believe that running popular newspapers is not "stylish" enough, and that since they are official newspapers playing a leading role in a certain region, they cannot be popular newspapers. This erroneous view must be corrected.

The Northwest Military and Political Committee's News and Publication Bureau convened the Northwest Region Newspaper Work Conference on January 20th, mainly to discuss how to further improve newspapers so that they truly become something that the broad masses of people love to read and listen to.

The meeting believed that newspapers in the Northwest region had not truly penetrated the masses. Even cadres were not very interested in newspapers. Taking the Masses Daily as an example: After the National News Work Conference, the Masses Daily paid attention to readers' letters and criticism and self-criticism, and was very lively for a period of time. However, it still only remained in the hands of cadres above the county level. In terms of regions, distribution was mainly in Xi'an and Shaanxi, with very few sales in Gansu, and even fewer in Qinghai. There are two reasons for these shortcomings: One is the newspaper's working method—that is, the working methods of newspaper staff are divorced from reality and divorced from the masses. This problem was originally resolved by the National News Work Conference, but it has not been implemented in actual work. Newspaper editors and reporters are mostly floating on the upper levels, running newspapers behind closed doors. For example, there is a phenomenon of reporters crowding in Xi'an, mostly staying at meeting interviews, often with four or five reporters attending the same meeting. Furthermore, of the Masses Daily’s editor-in-chief and cadres above the editor level, 14 people rarely go deep into factories and rural areas to understand the situation, analyze and raise problems. Some reporters who were sent out did not go deep into the lower levels. When they arrived at the lower levels, they only took a cursory look. There was even a city reporting team leader sitting at home who wrote that a road in Xi'an that had been planned to be paved with cement but had not been completed, had already been completed. The newspaper nominally set up a reception room, but no masses came to talk about problems. Various symposiums were also not convened proactively and in a timely manner. The work of establishing reading groups and worker-peasant correspondents was not actively implemented, and no effective measures were taken to carry out this work. The Masses Daily only had more than 1,800 correspondents, which did not play a significant role in practice. The newspaper itself did not conduct a systematic review of its own shortcomings and errors for a long time. Another reason is that the style of writing in the newspapers has not been improved. Many articles in the newspapers are lengthy and full of bureaucratic jargon. Some articles are just general appeals, lacking in-depth analysis, and publishing them does not serve any purpose, taking up valuable space in the newspaper and wasting readers' time. Newspapers always like to use rigid and lacking expression terms and phrases. For example, a commentary in the Masses Daily on October 4th last year said: "We believe that the future of the Korean War is by no means an unknown quantity"; the editorial on December 15th contained the phrase "to change the backward, ignorant, and tattered poor life." In addition, sayings such as "armed to the teeth" and "Dunkirk-style retreat" have been overused in newspapers, but the masses do not appreciate them. The propaganda column also failed to meet the current level of the propagandists and the needs of the masses. Often, an article for worker-peasant propagandists would be more than 3,000 words long. Some sentences were as long as one or two hundred words. Some cadres described "newspaper articles as like licorice, you don't have to eat it. Even if you eat it, it can't cure the disease." There were too many "twists and turns" and "jump fences" in the Ningxia Daily's layout. It was very difficult for readers with a low level of education to find the following sentences after reading the previous sentences, which affected their interest in reading.

The meeting first summarized the achievements of the newspaper work since the National News Work Conference. The meeting believed that the achievements were undeniable. The guiding role of newspapers has been strengthened. In terms of content, newspapers can combine current central tasks and focus on propaganda and reports on economic construction, people's democratic dictatorship, current affairs issues, and mass work issues. Newspaper comments have also gradually increased. Taking the Gansu Daily as an example, in the second half of last year, 76 county party secretaries and cadres above the county level wrote 124 commentaries for the Gansu Daily. In particular, the mass criticism and self-criticism movement was launched, and attention was paid to readers' letters. The Shaanxi Daily paid attention to localization and popularization, with an average of three-quarters of the space reflecting the situation in the province, of which two-thirds reflected the countryside, and began to be welcomed by the broad masses. In the second half of last year, the Ningxia Daily had more local news and strengthened the systematic guidance of the central work. The Qinghai Daily was able to regularly make serious public reviews of the shortcomings and errors that occurred in the newspaper itself in the newspaper. In the mass work of newspapers, the newspapers have developed more than 12,000 correspondents and established more than 4,100 reading groups. Of the more than 1,500 correspondents developed by the Xinjiang Daily, correspondents from the Uyghur, Kazakh, Tajik, and other fraternal ethnic groups accounted for half. After November last year, the Masses Daily established regular communication with Northwest worker-peasant models. The Gansu Daily held more than 40 various reader symposiums in a planned manner, with more than 1,500 people participating in the symposium. This played a very good role for the newspaper. Another major achievement is that, in view of the characteristics of the many ethnic groups in the Northwest, 13 fraternal ethnic newspapers were improved and established in Xinjiang, Qinghai, and other provinces and sub-regions, and a group of fraternal ethnic news cadres were trained. At present, there are 35 public and private newspapers in the entire Northwest (31 public, 3 private, and 1 new alliance), which are published in Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian, Tibetan, Uzbek, and Xibe and other minority languages. By the end of last year, the total circulation of the Northwest Greater Administrative Region and provincial-level newspapers was more than 100,000 copies, and there were nearly 1,000 news cadres. But the shortcomings mentioned above exist seriously.

Based on this situation, the meeting passed a resolution, determining that all newspapers should make greater efforts to strengthen the mass nature of newspapers and strive for all newspapers to become the most popular among the majority of local people. The specific methods are:

(1) Vigorously do a good job in readers' letters, worker-peasant correspondents, and reading group work. (2) The work style of newspaper editors and reporters must be connected with the masses. Each newspaper should select a large number of editors and reporters to go deep into the masses for interviews. The responsible comrades above the editor-in-chief of the newspaper should also regularly take turns to go to factories and rural areas to participate in mass work. (3) Thoroughly improve the style of writing in newspapers. Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia provincial newspapers should resolutely take the road of popularization of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Masses' Daily. New China News Agency telegraphic drafts should be compiled separately for cadres above the county level to meet their requirements. (4) Gradually strengthen newspapers' propaganda of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Increase newspaper commentaries, party life, and propagandist columns.

After the meeting, the newspapers have begun to make some improvements. For example, the Masses Daily has further fixed the "Letters from Heroic Models" column and strengthened contact with heroic models; some of the editor-in-chief and above cadres of the newspaper have been sent to work in various provinces, and the issue of writing style has attracted attention. The Gansu Daily has published the popular "Gansu Peasants" newspaper since March 15th. The Ningxia Daily and the Qinghai Daily changed the daily newspapers to popular tri-weekly newspapers from April 1st. In order to meet the needs of readers and cadres with a higher cultural level, the Ningxia Daily publishes a "News Express," and the Qinghai Daily publishes a "Xinhua News Agency News Draft," which is published daily on one sheet of quarto paper. The Ningxia Daily plans to rotate all cadres in two shifts to go to the countryside; and prepares to set up communication stations in Alxa League, Wuzhongbao, and other places to strengthen worker-peasant correspondent work and reporter work.

### 西北区报纸走向通俗化

　　西北区报纸走向通俗化
    编者按：本文报道西北地区报纸工作会议的结果，值得其他各地区报纸工作者认真注意，此次会议对于西北地区各报纸不够通俗化群众化的缺点作了深入的检讨，这些缺点在其他各地区的许多报纸中也是或多或少可以发现的。各级地方报纸按照需要向通俗化的方向走，是十分必要的。有的报纸工作者认为办通俗报纸不够“派头”，并认为，既然是在某一地区中起领导作用的机关报，就不能是通俗报纸，这种错误观念必须纠正。
    西北军政委员会新闻出版局于一月二十日，召开西北地区报纸工作会议，主要地讨论了如何进一步办好报纸，使它真正成为广大群众爱看爱听的问题。
    会议认为西北地区的报纸没有真正深入到群众中去。即使是干部，对报纸也没有很大兴趣。以群众日报为例：在全国新闻工作会议后，群众日报注意了读者来信和批评与自我批评，曾经有一个时期是很有生气的。但是，仍然是只停留在县以上干部手里，以地区来说，发行主要是西安市和陕西地区，甘肃就销得很少，青海更少。其所以产生这些缺点的原因有二：一个是报纸工作方法——即是报纸工作人员的工作方法脱离实际，脱离群众。这个问题，本来是全国新闻工作会议已经解决了的。可是没有在实际工作中加以贯彻。报纸编辑部人员和记者多是浮在上层，关起门来办报。像西安就有记者拥挤的现象，多是停留在会议采访上，常常是同一会议，就有四、五处的记者出席采访。又像群众日报总编辑和主编以上干部等十四人，很少深入工厂、农村中去了解情况，分析和提出问题。派出的一些记者，很多并未深入下层。到了下层，也只是走马观花。甚至有个城市报道组长坐在家里把西安一条曾经计划修洋灰路但未完成的马路，写成已经修好了。报社在形式上设立了接待室，却没有群众来谈问题。各种座谈会召开得亦不主动和及时。对于建立读报组和工农通讯员工作执行得不积极，没有采取各种有效办法来进行这项工作。群众日报才有一千八百多个通讯员，实际上不起什么大作用。报纸本身对自己的缺点和错误，长时间没有进行系统的检讨。另一个原因，是报纸文风未改进。报纸上许多文章，长篇大论，八股气味浓重。有些文章只是一般号召，缺乏深入分析，登了不起什么作用，占去了报纸的宝贵篇幅，浪费读者的时间。报纸上总爱用些生硬缺乏表现力量的术语和词句。如群众日报去年十月四日一篇时评说：“我们认为朝鲜战争的前途，决不是未知数”；十二月十五日社论中有“以改变落后、愚昧、鹑衣百结的穷苦生活”的词句。此外如“武装到了牙齿”、“敦刻尔克式的溃逃”之类的说法，在报纸上用滥了，群众却并不欣赏。宣传员专栏也未能切合宣传员的现有水平和群众的需要，往往，一篇给工农宣传员看的文章竟达三千多字。有的句子长达一、二百字。有些干部形容“报纸文章好像甘草一样，不吃也可以。吃了也治不了病”。宁夏日报编排“拐弯”“跳栏”太多，文化程度低的读者读了上文，很不容易找到下文，影响他们阅读的兴趣。
    这次会议首先总结了全国新闻工作会议以来报纸工作的成绩。会议认为有成绩是不容否认的。报纸指导性增强了。报纸在内容上能够结合当前中心工作，抓紧对经济建设、人民民主专政、时事问题、群众工作问题的宣传报道。报纸言论也逐渐增加了。以甘肃日报为例，去年下半年，已有七十六位县委书记和县长以上干部为甘肃日报写评论一百二十四篇。特别是开展了群众性的批评和自我批评运动，重视了读者来信。陕西日报注意了地方化、大众化，平均有四分之三篇幅反映本省情况，其中三分之二又是反映农村的，开始受到广大群众的欢迎。宁夏日报在去年下半年，地方消息多了，加强了对中心工作的系统指导。青海日报对报纸本身发生的缺点和错误，能够经常在报纸上认真地作公开检讨。在报纸群众工作上，各报共已发展通讯员一万二千多名，建立读报组四千一百多个。新疆日报发展的一千五百多个通讯员中，维、哈、塔等兄弟民族通讯员占了一半。群众日报去年十一月后和西北工农模范建立了经常的通讯联系，甘肃日报有计划地举行了四十多次各种读者座谈会，参加座谈的有一千五百余人。对报纸起了很好的作用。另一重大成绩是，针对西北多民族的特点，在新疆、青海等省改进和创办了省和分区的十三个兄弟民族报纸，培养了一批兄弟民族的新闻干部。现在全西北共有公私营报纸三十五种（公营三十一种，私营三种，另新盟一种），有用维、哈、蒙、藏、乌兹贝克和锡伯等少数民族文字出版的报纸。到去年年底止，西北大行政区和各省级报纸总发行数为十万余份，新闻干部近一千名。但是如前所述的缺点，是严重地存在着的。
    会议根据这种情况，通过了一项决议，确定所有报纸都应向加强报纸的群众性、争取所有报纸要成为当地最大多数群众所喜爱的方向作更大努力。具体办法是：
    （一）大力做好读者来信、工农通讯员和读报组工作。（二）报纸编辑记者的工作作风必须联系群众。各报应抽出大批编辑和记者深入群众进行采访，报纸主编以上负责同志亦应定期轮流到工厂农村中去参加群众工作。（三）彻底改进报纸的文风。甘肃、青海、宁夏省报应坚决走到陕甘宁边区群众报的通俗化道路。对县以上干部另编新华社电讯稿来满足他们的要求。（四）逐渐加强报纸对马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的宣传。增辟报纸述评、党的生活、宣传员专栏。
    在会议以后，各报已开始有了一些改进。如群众日报更加固定了《英雄模范来信》专栏，加强和英雄模范的联系；报社的一部分主编以上干部，已派到各省去工作，文风问题已引起注意。甘肃日报在三月十五日起另出版了通俗的《甘肃农民》报。宁夏日报和青海日报自四月一日起把日报改为通俗的三日刊。为了适应文化水平较高的读者和干部的需要，宁夏日报发行《新闻快报》一种，青海日报发行《新华社新闻稿》一种，日出四开一张。宁夏日报计划把全体干部分两班轮流下乡；并准备在阿拉善旗、吴忠堡等地设通讯站，以便加强工农通讯员工作和记者工作。
