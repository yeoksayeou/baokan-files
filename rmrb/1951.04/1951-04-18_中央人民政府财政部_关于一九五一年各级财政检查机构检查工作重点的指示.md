Since the notification of the establishment of financial inspection institutions at all levels and the promulgation of inspection methods last year, financial inspection work has attracted the attention of leaders at all levels. Most areas of provinces and cities have established institutions, and some have made considerable achievements. However, because this is a new task, many areas have not paid enough attention to it. In addition, the scope of inspection is quite broad, and newly established institutions inevitably feel overwhelmed or take detours. Therefore, we hereby issue the following instructions regarding the financial inspection work for 1951:

    I. Inspection of Enterprises and Institutions: In the future, enterprise income and production construction expenditures will be a very important part of our national budget. We must strictly supervise the implementation of the budget by various enterprise departments to promote the gradual normalization of their financial revenue and expenditure plans, so as to reduce the waste of state assets. Therefore, we require financial departments at all levels to make the inspection of enterprises and institutions one of the key points of this year's inspection work, to prepare the foundation for long-term construction in the future. Enterprises and institutions belonging to the major administrative regions, provinces, and cities shall be inspected by the respective financial departments at those levels; those belonging to the central government shall be inspected by the Ministry, and local financial departments may be entrusted to conduct inspections when necessary.

    II. Inspection of Budget and Final Account Preparation and Budget Execution of Financial Departments and Financial Departments at All Levels: In order to strengthen financial discipline and further improve the planning of national finance, the preparation of budgets, the execution of budgets, and the preparation of final accounts of financial departments and financial departments at all levels must be supervised and inspected. For example, was the budget prepared after investigation and research? Are there any specific bases? Is the execution of the budget in violation of financial discipline? Has the income been completed or exceeded the target? Is the tax levied according to the rate? Are there any instances of tax evasion? What is the situation of delivery to the treasury? Is the expenditure executed in accordance with the budget? Is it used properly? Are there any violations of the system or corruption and waste? When preparing the final accounts, examine the changes in the budget and their reasons, and examine the effect of various revenues and expenditures. This is a very complex but very important task, and we must start to carry it out.

    The above are the two major projects of this year's financial inspection work. In order to carry out this task, financial departments at all levels are required to establish and strengthen inspection institutions as soon as possible to better carry out the work, and it is hoped that they will report the progress of inspection work and the problems encountered to us at any time.

　　中央人民政府财政部
    关于一九五一年各级财政检查机构检查工作重点的指示
    自去年通知建立各级财政检查机构，并公布检查办法后，财政检查工作已引起各级领导的重视，各省市大部地区已建立机构，有的且已做出不少成绩，但因这是一项新的工作，还有不少地区对之注意不够，加以检查范围颇广，初建机构，难免感到顾此失彼或走弯路，为此，特将一九五一年的财政检查工作，做如下的指示：
    一、检查企业、事业：今后企业收入和生产建设支出，将是我们国家预算中的一个很重要的部分，我们必须严格监督各企业部门对预算的执行，促使其财务收支计划逐步走上正轨，以减少国家资财的浪费。因此，我们要求各级财政部门将检查企业、事业做为今年检查工作的重点之一，为今后的长期建设准备基础。凡属于各大区、省、市的企业、事业，由各该级财政部门负责检查；属于中央的，由本部负责检查，必要时可委托地方财政部门代查。
    二、检查各级财政部门、财务部门的预算、决算编造及预算执行情况：为了加强财政纪律，进一步提高国家财政的计划性，对各级财政部门、财务部门的预算的编造，预算的执行，和决算的编造，必须实行监督和检查。如预算的编造是否经过调查研究？有无具体根据？预算的执行是否有违反财政纪律？收入是否完成或超过任务？税收是否依率计征？有无偷漏现象？解库情况如何？支出是否按照预算执行？用的是否得当？有无违反制度或贪污浪费现象？编造决算时，则检查预算的变动及其原因，考查各项收入和支出的效果。这是一项很复杂但是很重要的工作，我们必须着手进行。
    以上是今年财政检查工作的两大项目。为了执行这个任务，要求各级财政部门尽早建立、充实检查机构，更好的开展工作，并希将检查工作进行情况及所遇到的问题随时报告我们。
