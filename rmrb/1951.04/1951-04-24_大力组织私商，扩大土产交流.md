  (I)
　　Various regions are now vigorously organizing the exchange of native products. This is one of the most important tasks in the current economic work. To make the large quantity, scattered production areas, and numerous types of native products circulate, it is not enough to rely solely on state-owned trade and cooperatives. This requires us to vigorously organize private merchants to participate in this work. According to the experience of various regions in the past six months, significant achievements have been made in regions that have well-united and organized private merchants to carry out this work. For example, in Pingyuan Province, from November of last year to the end of February of this year, through the joint efforts of state-owned trade and private merchants, 75.6% of 85 major native products have been sold, with a value equivalent to over 800 million catties of millet, exceeding the amount of public grain submitted to the state by the province last year. In Shanxi Province, 53% of 15 types of native products had been sold by the end of December last year. In the two months around the Spring Festival in Chahar Province, according to incomplete statistics, over 16 million catties of grain, over 630,000 catties of white hemp, and over 15,800 catties of medicinal materials were sold to other provinces through various joint venture organizations. In Jiangxi Province, in September of last year, state-owned companies entrusted private merchants to purchase 10 million catties of new grain and native products worth over 5 billion yuan in rural areas. Furthermore, according to estimates from Jiangxi Province, at least 50% of the grain and at least 70% of the native products that need to be transported out of the province in the autumn of last year and the spring of this year need to be handled by private merchants. In Shanxi Province, since last year, private merchants have handled approximately 50% of the sales of native products. Facts have proven that private merchants are an indispensable force in commodity circulation. We should effectively organize and lead private merchants to serve the exchange of native products.
  (II)
　　To organize private merchants to expand the exchange of native products, attention must be paid to the following tasks:
　　First, dispel the ideological concerns of private merchants. The main concerns of private merchants regarding the exchange of native products are: (1) lack of understanding of the policies of the People's Government; (2) questions about business operations: Is there a future in native product trade? Will I lose money? Which item is good to deal in? (3) fear of being taken advantage of when cooperating with public entities; (4) some who have cooperated with the government have the idea of “using public resources to support private interests” and simply relying on public entities. This requires us to clearly explain the policies to private merchants, pointing out the importance of carrying out urban-rural exchange for the prosperity of the social economy; guide private merchants to engage in trade activities facing the domestic market and rural areas, changing the past operating method of "sitting and waiting for customers"; explain that unity and mutual benefit, and self-reliance will provide solutions, and help them build confidence. It must be pointed out that emphasizing agriculture and neglecting commerce, emphasizing production and neglecting sales, or having ideas and practices of squeezing out private merchants are all incorrect.
　　Second, administrative promotion and guidance are very important for organizing private merchants. According to the experience of the North China region, first, the leadership must purposefully convene native product conferences and universally hold exhibitions of industrial and agricultural products, as well as handicrafts. Native product conferences should achieve the following: (1) clarify that promoting native products is an important key to current financial and economic work, so that the representatives attending the meeting fully understand the policies; (2) comprehensively introduce the "production," "transportation," and "sales" specifications, rates, prices, etc., so that the representatives can exchange opinions with each other; (3) introduce the experience of native product conferences in various regions, and communicate information on supply and demand and the seasonality of native products in various regions; (4) solve specific problems related to taxation and transportation; (5) formulate purchasing and sales plans; (6) organize the signing of purchasing and sales contracts. In exhibitions, the industrial, agricultural, and commercial sectors should understand each other's needs, learn from each other, and provide opinions on improving quality and specifications. Such conferences can inspire private merchants and industrial and agricultural representatives to recognize the importance of promoting native products. These meetings have a positive publicity and guiding role. Native product conferences and exhibitions in some cities in North China have been very successful and have achieved great results, and they should be vigorously promoted throughout the country.
　　Relevant leading authorities should provide guidance on the business opportunities for private merchants, guiding and organizing industries and floating capital that are difficult to develop and have no future to shift to the native product business. In order to guide this work in an organized and systematic manner, a materials exchange guidance committee can be jointly organized by the industrial and commercial administration, tax bureau, federation of industry and commerce, cooperatives, and relevant state-owned trade agencies to regularly study the situation and guide the work. According to the current experience of various regions: mobilizing private merchants to form "sales teams" to go deep into rural areas to purchase native products and promote industrial and handicraft products; organizing industrial and commercial delegations to visit various places, establishing contacts on the one hand, and purchasing and selling native and special products on the other; organizing "peddler teams" to conduct purchasing and sales in neighboring rural areas; and organizing merchants to purchase goods in distant places are all good methods. In addition to this, we must also pay attention to solving three problems: First, restore and establish new and old commercial networks. Due to the aggression war by Japanese invaders and the anti-people civil war by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang for more than ten years, regional divisions and traffic blockages have caused great damage to the old economic connections—the commercial network. For example, in WuZhi County, Pingyuan Province, and Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, there were 39 forwarding agencies before the war, but now only 5 are left. In some areas of Xinxiang, because there are no bamboo forwarding agencies, foreign merchants could not purchase goods locally after arriving last year, while local producers had nowhere to sell. The impact on the exchange of native products will be great if the commercial network is not restored or established in a timely manner. Therefore, it is necessary to: (1) encourage the restoration or establishment of primary markets such as fairs, temple fairs, and mule and horse fairs; (2) in small towns, state-owned companies should take the lead in setting up comprehensive stores to handle agency sales and purchases; (3) establish forwarding agencies (new types) in medium-sized cities as places for distant merchants to stay and handle trust businesses. And improve the management and operation of existing forwarding agencies and hotels to facilitate merchants and farmers entering the city; (4) organize transportation stations and use the carts, small carts, and livestock of rural masses to form transportation forces to serve the exchange of native products. Second, relevant local departments (industry and commerce, taxation, trade, banks, transportation, etc.) must cooperate effectively, closely coordinate, and take consistent steps. Third, county and district cadres (especially district and village cadres) should deeply publicize the benefits of promoting native products for the rural economy to farmers, encourage them to welcome foreign merchants who purchase and sell native products, and call on them not to raise prices arbitrarily to ensure smooth sales of native products.
　　Third, the leadership of the state-owned economy. In organizing private merchants to expand the exchange of native products, the leadership of the state-owned economy plays a decisive role. Past experience has proven:
　　(1) The participation of state-owned enterprises in leadership, through methods such as entrusted agency purchases and sales, can organize scattered private merchants and introduce them to planned operations. State-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and private businesses should cooperate appropriately, divide labor, and cooperate in order to play a greater role.
　　(2) State-owned enterprises mobilize private merchants to go to the countryside together to undertake the work of purchasing native products and supplying industrial products. The benefits of doing this are: on the one hand, guiding idle funds so that idle funds concentrated in cities can play a positive role; on the other hand, encouraging and organizing private merchants to operate materials that the state cannot and does not yet need to operate.
　　(3) Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, vigorously promote the contract system to organize the exchange of materials, overcome market blindness, and complete planned purchases and sales. Under the conditions of strict fulfillment of contracts, it is also possible to improve the quality of goods and eliminate or reduce phenomena such as adulteration and non-compliance with specifications.
　　(4) State-owned enterprises can use some of their capital to absorb private shares to organize public-private joint venture native product transportation and sales companies, driving private capital to participate in the purchase and sale of native and special products.
  (III)
　　Organizing joint ventures by private merchants is an important form of carrying out urban-rural material exchange. The methods of organizing joint ventures by private merchants have been promoted in various provinces and cities in North China, Wuhan City and Jiangxi Province in the Central and South region, and Shanghai and Jinan cities in East China, and have achieved considerable results. The experience of various regions proves that this is a method that is welcomed and urgently required by general private merchants: (1) After the joint venture, the private industrial and commercial sector can be guided from a decentralized and backward mode of operation to a rationalized operation; it can also connect the three aspects of "production," "sales," and "transportation," reduce the commercial process, accelerate the circulation of materials, and expand the market. (2) Organizing joint ventures and joint purchases can eliminate competition among the same industry and avoid price gouging, thereby reducing the cost of goods. Joint procurement requires fewer people and less expense, which can achieve small profits but quick turnover. (3) After the joint venture, the funds are concentrated, the talents are concentrated, and each unit learns from each other's strengths to make up for weaknesses, which can solve the difficulties of small businesses such as "small capital, inability to run far, and lack of technology." (4) Communicate various social and economic connections: connect industry and commerce through processing orders; connect production and consumption between regions through visits, consultations, and signing contracts; strengthen the connection between small rural producers through the joint purchase of raw materials; connect the relationship between public and private through the absorption of idle funds and bank lending. (5) In the process of joint venture, private merchants understand that it is beneficial to organize, gradually overcome the old consciousness of "the same trade is an enemy," and begin to move towards the new direction of "learning from each other's strengths, making up for weaknesses, and mutual assistance and mutual benefit." In terms of joint venture organizational forms, according to the current experience of various regions, there are mainly: (1) Joint Venture Company: The internal organization is a company, with a certain amount of capital, and the profit and loss of the business belong to the company. Different from general companies, the shareholders of the joint venture company are each enterprise unit, and each unit itself still operates independently. (2) Joint Venture Office (Place, Society): This form is currently the most common. The joint venture itself only has a fund, and the participating manufacturers maintain administrative and accounting independence. During the joint venture period, all external affairs are handled by the joint venture organization, and each participating unit is jointly responsible. As for the mode of operation, it varies depending on the purpose of the organization. In the commercial field, there can be: joint purchase and joint sales, joint purchase and distribution sales, joint lending, and joint investment in transportation. The above various joint ventures are sometimes composed of various different components, including: "public-private joint venture," "commercial joint venture," "industrial joint venture," "citizen joint venture," and "joint venture in which small households merge into large households for operation." However, attention must be paid to the following principles when organizing joint ventures:
　　(1) There must be leadership and focus: adopt different leadership methods according to different objects and different requirements. Small merchants and peddlers have small capital, so it is advisable to organize joint purchases first to reduce costs, and then gradually move towards joint sales in rural areas. Wholesaling is the main business for seated merchants, so it is advisable to first change the idea of "waiting for customers at the store," on the one hand, organizing joint purchases in rural areas, and on the other hand, forming groups in large cities. Large households and small households have different requirements, and even if they are in the same industry, they should not be forced to organize together.
　　(2) Joint ventures should be based on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, and should not be forcibly promoted using administrative power. Cultivate typical demonstrations, and encourage and guide other private merchants to voluntarily organize joint ventures with the actual achievements of typical households.
　　(3) Organized private merchants should be rewarded. Under possible conditions, priority should be given to providing convenience in terms of loans, agency purchases, agency sales, wholesale, credit, etc., and guidance should be provided in all aspects.

　　大力组织私商，扩大土产交流
    管大同
  （一）
    各地现在正在大力组织土产的交流工作。这是当前经济工作中最重要的任务之一。要使数量庞大、产地分散、种类繁多的土产流动起来，只是依靠国营贸易与合作社的力量是很不够的。这就需要我们去大力组织私商参加这一工作。根据过去半年来各地的经验，凡是很好团结私商、组织私商来进行这一工作的，都有很大的成绩。如：平原省八十五种主要土产，从去年十一月到本年二月底，经过国营贸易与私商共同努力，已推销出去百分之七五·六，价值折合八亿多斤小米，超过该省去年向国家交纳公粮的数目。山西省十五种土产，到去年十二月底已售出百分之五三。察哈尔省在春节前后两个月当中，据不完全统计，经过各种联营组织，销往省外的粮食有一千六百余万斤，白麻六十三万余斤，药材一万五千八百余斤。江西省在去年九月份内，由国营公司委托私商下乡代购新谷一千万斤，和价值五十余亿元的土产。又据江西省的估计，去秋及今春需要运出省外换取工业品的粮食至少有百分之五十，土产至少有百分之七十要靠私商经营。山西省从去年到现在，土产品的推销，由私商经营的约占百分之五十。事实证明，私商在运转商品上，是一支不可缺少的力量。我们应该很好地组织和领导私商，来为土产交流工作服务。
  （二）
    组织私商来扩大土产交流，必须注意进行以下几项工作：
    第一、打破私商的思想顾虑。私商对土产交流的顾虑，主要有：（一）对人民政府政策不了解。（二）对业务经营方面有疑问：做土产有无前途？会不会赔本？搞那一项好？（三）怕与公家合作私人会吃亏。（四）有些与政府合作过的，则又有“以公养私”单纯依赖公家的思想。这就需要我们很好地向私商阐明政策，指出当前开展城乡交流对繁荣社会经济的重要性；指导私商应面向国内、面向农村展开贸易活动，改变过去“坐待顾客上门”的经营方式；说明团结互利、自力更生就会有办法，帮助他们树立信心。必须指出，重农轻商，重生产不重销售，或有排挤私商的想法和做法，都是不对的。
    第二、行政上的推动与指导对于组织私商是一个很重要的问题。根据华北地区经验，首先要有领导有目的地召开土产会议和普遍举办工农产品以及手工业产品的展览会。在土产会议中要作到：（一）阐明推销土产是当前财经工作中的重要关键，使参加会议代表充分了解政策。（二）多方面介绍“产”“运”“销”规格、费率、价格等情况，使各代表互相交换意见。（三）介绍各地土产会议经验，沟通各地供求和土产季节性的情况。（四）解决有关税收运输等具体问题。（五）制定购销计划。（六）组织签订购销合同。在展览会中，要使工、农、商各界互相了解需求，互相观摩，提供改良品质规格的意见。这样的会议可以启发私商和工农代表们认识到推销土产的重要性。这些会议具有积极的宣传和指导作用。华北有些城市的土产会议和展览会开得很好，收到了很大效果，全国各地都应极力推广。
    对私商经营的出路有关领导机关要加以指导，引导与组织那些没有前途难于发展的行业和游资转向土产经营方面去。为了有组织有系统地指导这一工作，可吸收工商行政、税务局、工商业联合会、合作社以及有关的国营贸易机关，共同组织物资交流指导委员会，经常研究情况与指导工作。根据目前各地经验：动员私商组织“推销小组”，深入农村采购土产和推销工业品、手工业品；组织工商界访问团分赴各地访问，一面建立联系，一面购销土产品与特产品；组织“摊贩小组”到邻近乡区进行购销；以及组织行商到远地办货等，都是很好的办法。除此之外，我们还必须注意解决三个问题：第一、恢复与建立新旧商业网。由于十余年来日寇的侵略战争与蒋介石匪帮的反人民内战，使地区分割，交通阻塞，旧有经济联系——商业网——大多遭受破坏。如平原省的武陟、山西省的阳城，战前有怀货栈三十九户，现只剩下五户。新乡有的地区因为没有竹货行栈，去年外来客商到达当地后无处购货，而当地生产者却无处出售。如不及时恢复或建立商业网，对于土产交流的影响很大。因此必须：（一）鼓励恢复或成立集市、庙会、骡马大会等初级市场。（二）小城镇由国营公司带头设立一揽子商店，办理代销代购业务。（三）在中等城市内建立行栈（新型的）作远地客商落脚之处，兼办信托业务。并改善现有货栈客店的管理经营，以便利商旅和农民入城。（四）组织运输栈，利用农村群众的大车、小车、牲口等组成运输力量，为土产交流服务。第二、当地各有关部门（工商、税务、贸易、银行、交通等）须切实合作，紧密配合，步骤一致。第三、县区干部（特别是区村干部）应向农民深入宣传推销土产对于农村经济上的利益，鼓励他们欢迎外来购销土产的商人，号召他们不随便抬价，以求土产畅销。
    第三、国营经济的领导。在组织私商扩大土产交流工作中，国营经济的领导是具有决定性作用的。过去经验证明：
    （一）国营企业参加领导，通过委托代购代销等办法，可以把散漫的私商组织起来，导入计划性的经营。国营贸易公司、合作社、私营商业应适当配合，分工合作，才能发挥更大作用。
    （二）国营企业发动私商共同下乡担负收购土产与供应工业品的工作。这样做的好处是：一方面疏导游资，使集中于城市的游资能发挥积极作用；另方面则鼓励与组织私商经营国家所不能与尚不须经营的物资。
    （三）在国营经济领导下，大力推行合同制，以组织物资交流，克服市场盲目性，完成有计划地购销。在严格履行合同的条件下，还可以提高货物的品质，取缔或减少掺杂及不合规格等现象。
    （四）国营企业可以用一部分资力，吸收私股组织公私合营的土产运销公司，带动私人资本，参加土产特产的购销。
  （三）
    组织私商联营是开展城乡物资交流的一个重要形式。组织私商联营的办法，华北各省市，中南区的武汉市与江西省，华东的上海、济南等市都曾推行，而且都收到相当成果。各地经验证明，这是为一般私商所乐于接受和迫切要求的一种办法：（一）经过联营可以指导私营工商业由分散落后的经营方式走向合理化的经营；还可以把“产”“销”“运”三方面贯串联系起来，减少了商业过程，加速了物资流通，扩大了市场。（二）组织联营联购可以消除同业间的竞购，避免哄抬价格现象，因而减低进货成本；联合采购用人少，开支小，可以实现薄利多销。（三）联营后，资金集中，人材集中，各单位互相取长补短，可以解决小商业“资本小、跑不远、缺技术”等困难。（四）沟通各种社会经济的联系：通过加工定货联系了工商业；通过访问协商和订合同，联系地区间之生产消费；通过联购原料，加强了乡村小生产者间的联系；通过吸收游资，银行投放，联系公私间的关系。（五）在联营过程中，使私商了解到组织起来有好处，逐渐克服“同行是冤家”的旧意识，开始走向“取长补短，互助两利”的新方向。在联营组织形式方面根据目前各地经验主要有：（一）联营公司：内部为公司组织，有一定资本额，营业的利润盈亏属于公司。和一般公司不同的是联营公司股东是各企业单位，而各单位本身仍单独经营。（二）联营处（所，社）：目前以这种形式最多，联营本身仅有基金，参加厂商保持行政与会计的独立，联营期间，凡以联营经营组织对外一切事务，各参加单位连带负责。至于经营的方式，因组织目的而不同。在商业方面可有：联购联销、联购分销、联合放款及联合投资运输等方式。以上各种联营有时由各种不同成分组成，有：“公私合营”、“商业联营”、“工业联营”、“市民联营”、“小户合并为大户经营的联营”等。但在组织联营时必须注意以下的原则：
    （一）要有领导有重点：根据不同对象，不同要求，采用不同的领导方法。小商摊贩资本小，宜先组织联购，减低成本，再逐渐走向下乡联销。座商以批发为主，宜先转变“门市等待”思想，一方面向农村组织联购，一方面向大城市组。大户小户要求不同，虽然同一行业，不应勉强组织在一起。
    （二）联营应根据自愿两利原则，不应利用行政力量强制推行。培植典型示范，以典型户的实际成效鼓励引导其它私商自愿组织联营。
    （三）对组织起来的私商，应予以奖励。在可能的条件下，尽量优先给予贷款、代购、代销、批发、信用等的便利，并在各方面予以指导。
