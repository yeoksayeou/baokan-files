　　U.S. Aircraft Barbarously Bomb Medical Institutions
　　Korean Red Cross Lodges Strong Protest
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 24th] According to a TASS dispatch from Pyongyang on April 21st: The Central Committee of the Korean Red Cross Society has issued a statement protesting the barbaric atrocities of the U.S. Air Force in violating the basic principles of morality and international law. The statement said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly and resolutely protested the barbaric bombing of hospitals and other medical institutions bearing the Red Cross emblem by U.S. aircraft. However, the devastating air raids continue, while the United Nations tacitly encourages the imperialists to engage in banditry in Korea. Recently, American aerial bandits bombed and burned hospitals of the Red Cross, central pharmacies, drug warehouses, pharmaceutical factories, and the buildings of the Central Committee of the Korean Red Cross Society in Wonsan, Pyongyang, and other cities, all marked with the Red Cross emblem. In these barbaric air raids, hundreds of doctors, nurses, pharmacy staff, and responsible persons of the Red Cross district committees were killed or wounded. Hundreds of wounded soldiers in the hospitals were either killed or severely wounded again.

　　美机野蛮轰炸医疗机关
　  朝鲜红十字会严正抗议
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社平壤二十一日电：朝鲜红十字会中央委员会顷发表声明，抗议美国空军野蛮地违反道德与国际法的基本原则的暴行。声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾经一再坚决抗议美国飞机野蛮地轰炸医院和其他有红十字标志的医疗机关的暴行。但是毁灭性的空袭还在继续进行，而联合国却默默地鼓励帝国分子在朝鲜进行强盗行为。美国空中强盗们最近又炸毁了和焚毁了元山、平壤以及其他城市的有红十字会标志的红十字会的医院、中央药房、药库、制药厂以及朝鲜红十字会中央委员会的建筑物。在这些野蛮的空袭中，数百名医师、护士、药房职员、红十字会区委员会的负责人都被炸死或炸伤。在医院中的数百伤兵不是被炸死便是再度受到重伤。
