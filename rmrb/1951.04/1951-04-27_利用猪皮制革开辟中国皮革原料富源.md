Utilizing Pigskin for Leather Production Opens Up a Rich Source of Leather Raw Materials in China
Central People's Government, Ministry of Light Industry, Leather Group

During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation, rural areas across the country suffered destruction and looting by Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, leading to a significant decrease in the number of draught cattle. Consequently, the main raw material for the leather industry, cowhide, was also in extremely short supply. After liberation, in most agricultural areas of the country, land reform was nearing completion, and agricultural production was gradually recovering. Farmers were urgently in need of buying more draught cattle, making the shortage of cowhide, as an industrial raw material, even more acute. On the other hand, the demand for leather from national defense needs and industrial construction has also increased more than at any previous time. With such a pressing need and limited sources, the only way to remedy the situation is to open up other sources. Utilizing pigskin for leather production is an effective solution.

The History of Utilizing Pigskin for Leather Production

The use of pigskin has a long history in other countries. In the Soviet Union, for example, even before 1935, annual production reached 9 million pigskins. Currently, it is undoubtedly higher. South America also has a significant output, used to manufacture saddles, harnesses, shoe uppers, gloves, handbags, suitcases, leather clothing, and other items. In China, the use of pigskin, taking Jiaodong as an example, dates back at least a century. Smoked pigskin (the oldest method of pigskin leather production), is used by farmers themselves as sole leather when making cloth shoes. Pigskin is also used to make suitcases and handbags. In Wendeng alone, more than one million catties of light and heavy pig leather were produced in 1950. In Tianjin, in the early years of the Republic of China, chrome-tanned pigskin (i.e., using potassium dichromate to tan pigskin for leather, same below) sole leather was made into so-called "French blue-bottomed" casual shoes, which were well-received in the Northwest. In mid-July 1950, a large quantity of pig leather was exported. Pigskin leather production in Northeast China also has a history of many years. Currently, individual factories can produce 1,000 sheets of pig leather per day, including chrome-tanned grain leather and vegetable-tanned sole leather (using tanning with glue for pigskin leather production, same below), for both military and civilian use.

The Manufacturing of Pig Leather

Those who have not used pigskin for leather production often worry that pigskin has too much oil, unlike cow and sheepskin. In fact, after the liming process, pigskin becomes "white leather," which is exactly the same as cow and sheepskin. Mineral or vegetable tanning, or mineral and vegetable combination tanning, can be used. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, major leather factories in Northeast China, North China, and East China produced large quantities of pigskin. Leather workers in these regions with seven or eight years of experience or more have experience in manufacturing pig leather. Currently, some large factories in the Northeast still exclusively manufacture pig leather. The manufacturing method is as follows: after soaking pigskin in water to remove grease (scraping it off with a knife), it is soaked in increasingly strong lime water for nine days to remove the hair. After de-liming, it is used the same way as ordinary cow and sheepskin. Recently, North China Leather Factory and others are conducting demonstration manufacturing to promote the use of pigskin. Beijing Zhenbei Leather Factory is also manufacturing pig leather. Shanghai Yimin Leather Factory, due to the difficulty in purchasing raw pigskin, is using the pigskin of pigs that died from epidemic diseases to make leather, and is using this type of pig leather entirely to make leather shoes. Therefore, the manufacturing aspect of pig leather is not a major problem. Leather factories in various regions can go to the aforementioned leather factories to learn and observe if necessary.

To solve the problem of pigskin leather production, the Central People's Government Ministry of Light Industry sent people to the Tianqiao Slaughterhouse in Beijing for a detailed visit and conducted an actual pigskinning experiment, discovering the following problems and proposing solutions:

1.  Comparison of Labor Hours for Skinning and Scalding (scalding meaning removing hair): The wage for slaughtering one pig is RMB 4,500 (plus pig blood). Whether the work increases when skinning pigs, and whether wages should be increased accordingly, is worth studying. According to preliminary understanding, each pot has eight workers, slaughtering eight pigs per hour, which means each person slaughters one pig per hour. The situation of this pigskinning experiment is: two people can skin at least four pigs per hour, that is to say, each person can skin one pig in half an hour, and there is no problem in scalding pig heads and pig trotters in the remaining half hour. In this way, the time required for the work is the same, and wages do not need to be increased. This point requires relevant authorities to conduct persuasion and education for slaughterhouse workers, so that they understand the state's policies, are not bound by old habits, and do not emphasize wage increases, so as not to create difficulties for pigskin leather production work.

2.  Pig Bristles and Pig Hair Issue: According to local customs, when pigs are transported to the slaughterhouse, the bristles are pulled out from the live pigs. According to the experience of the Northeast Leather Factory, plucking the bristles of live pigs does not affect the pigskin. The original pig owner can still remove the pig bristles according to old habits. As for pig hair, in the past, it was removed after scalding and handed over to the original pig owner. In the future, the price can be determined according to the size of the pig and the amount of hair obtained, and the leather factory can pay a reasonable price. The leather factory can adopt the liming method for hair removal, preserving the pig hair for various uses. In this way, the leather factory does not suffer any loss.

3.  Pigskin Price Aspect: The price of pigskin should be equal to or cheaper than pork, but not too cheap. If pigskin is more expensive than meat, the slaughterhouse may leave a lot of meat on the skin; conversely, if it is much cheaper than meat, the pig owner would rather not skin the pig, or not slaughter the pig at the slaughterhouse, to avoid losses. This point should be carefully considered.

4.  Pigskin Quality Aspect: Large skin, small skin, thick skin, and thin skin should all be peeled off. All pigskins do not necessarily have to be made into sole leather. If only thick skins are peeled off and thin skins are not, there will definitely be deviations in the future. For example, improved breeds of pigs have poor bristles and thin hides. Although they cannot be used as sole leather, they can be used as grain leather.

5.  To take care of the slaughterhouses, if pigskin is skinned for leather production in Beijing and Tianjin, then pork transported from other places to Beijing and Tianjin must also be skinned. Although it is not very convenient to transport pork after skinning, the pork transported to Beijing and Tianjin is generally transported in cold weather, wrapped in rush bags or reed mats, which can solve the difficulty of transporting pork wrapped in hemp bags due to the thick layer of outer fat.

6.  Citizen Habits Issue: Small cities have unsound sanitation institutions, and citizens mostly distinguish whether a pig is diseased based on its skin. However, in big cities, all pork must first be inspected by sanitation institutions. The inspection stamp is the same whether it is stamped on the skin or on the meat. Citizens who buy meat with skin mostly (especially when stir-frying) throw away the skin when cooking; sometimes it costs more money to buy meat without skin. As for pig head meat and trotters, this kind of skin is not suitable for leather production, and it is also inconvenient to skin. They can be cut off separately before skinning, scalded to remove hair, and eaten as usual. Some people say that pigskin is to protect pork from spoilage, but in fact, pigskin can only protect the fat from spoilage, and cannot protect the muscles that are very prone to spoilage. The main reason for buying meat with skin is still the citizens' habits. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize cadres at all levels, local newspapers, cooperate with governments at all levels, and carry out propaganda and education in a planned and step-by-step manner to make citizens eat skinned pork, and at the same time mobilize leather factories to make them happy to manufacture pigskin.

7.  To promote pigskin leather production, it is recommended that local tax authorities consider the situation and provide pigskin with preferential treatment of exemption from goods tax during the initial promotion period to encourage it.

8.  Pigskin Preservation Issue: If too many pigskins are skinned, the leather factory's production capacity is limited, and pigskins may pile up. Pigskin contains too much oil. If it is dried into dry skin in the shade, it will be extremely difficult to soak in water. To remedy this shortcoming, it is necessary for salt affairs authorities to supply cheap industrial salt (i.e., salt that cannot be eaten because it contains chemical drugs). After washing the pigskin clean and scraping off as much grease as possible, add a little preservative and make it into salted fresh skin or salted dry skin, which can be stored for later use. In areas where table salt is scarce, lime can be used instead of table salt to make lime-board skin for storage and later use. It is imperative to prevent people from suffering losses after skinning pigs because they cannot sell the pigskin or because it is not properly preserved, which is very harmful to the promotion of pigskin leather production.

Strengthening the Propaganda and Promotion of Pigskin Leather Production

The Central People's Government Ministry of Light Industry, when convening the National Leather Industry Conference in December 1950, called on leather factories across the country to use pigskin for leather production to supply military and civilian use, to make up for the shortage of cowhide. After the conference made a resolution, it was approved by the Central Financial and Economic Commission. During this period, experts have done a lot of publicity work. Individual regions (such as the Northeast) are already implementing it. To widely promote this policy, it is still necessary to rely on governments at all levels, local newspapers, cadres at all levels, and leather factories to work together, pool wisdom, and conduct in-depth propaganda and explanation.

　　利用猪皮制革开辟中国皮革原料富源
    中央人民政府轻工业部皮革组
    在八年抗日战争、三年解放战争期间，各地农村遭受日本帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的破坏掠夺，耕牛数量大为减少。制革工业的主要原料牛皮，因而也异常缺乏。解放后全国大部农业地区，土地改革将近完成，农业生产逐渐恢复，农民急须添买耕牛，做为工业原料的牛皮就更感缺乏。但在另一方面，国防军需、工业建设对皮革的需要也较以前任何时期加多了。需要如此之殷，而来源又有限，补救之道，惟有另外开辟来源。利用猪皮制革就是一个有效的办法。
  利用猪皮制革的历史
    利用猪皮，在其他国家中，已有悠久历史。以苏联来说，远在一九三五年以前，每年即可生产九百万张猪皮。目下当不止此数。南美洲亦有巨额出产，用以制造马鞍、马具、鞋面、手套、皮包、皮箱、皮衣等物件。我国利用猪皮的历史，以胶东来说，至少已有百年。烟鞣猪皮（用烟薰猪皮，最老的猪皮制革的办法），农民自制布鞋时，用作底革，其他皮箱皮包，亦用猪皮来做。只文登一区，一九五○年即制造一百余万斤轻重猪革。天津在民国初年，铬鞣猪皮（即用铬酸钾鞣猪皮做革，下同）底革，制成所谓法蓝底便鞋，销售西北，很受欢迎。一九五○年七月中旬，曾有大批猪革出口。在东北猪皮制革亦有多年历史。目下个别工厂，每日可产猪革一千张，包括铬鞣面革及植物鞣底革（用掺胶鞣猪皮制革，下同），以供军需民用。
  猪革的制造
    没有利用过猪皮制革的人，常顾虑猪皮上油脂太多，和牛羊皮不同。实际上猪皮经灰水工程，变成白皮后，和牛羊皮是完全一样的。用矿物或植物鞣，或矿物、植物复鞣都可。抗日战争期间，东北、华北、华东的各大制革厂都曾大量制造过猪皮，这些地区的有七八年以上工龄的制革工人，都有制造猪革的经验。目前东北有些大工厂，仍然完全制造猪革。制造方法为：猪皮浸水去脂后（用刀刮去），在逐日加强的灰水中浸九日，即可脱毛。脱灰后即与普通牛羊皮一样使用。最近华北制革厂等，为了提倡利用猪皮，正进行示范性制造。北京振北制革厂亦正制造猪革。上海益民制革厂，因生猪皮不易购得，利用瘟猪皮制革，并全用此种猪革制成皮鞋，所以猪革在制造方面，问题并不大。各地皮革工厂在必要时可以到上述各制革厂学习观摩。
    为了解决猪皮制革问题，中央人民政府轻工业部曾派人赴北京天桥屠宰场详细访问，并作了一次实际剥猪皮的试验，发现下列问题并提出了解决的办法：
    １、剥皮与汤退（汤退即是将毛退掉）所耗工时的比较：宰猪工人，每宰猪一只，工资为人民币四千五百元（再加猪血）。剥猪皮时，工作是否增加，工资应否酌量增加，这是值得研究的。据初步了解，现在每一个锅，八个工人，每小时宰猪八个，合每人每小时宰猪一头。此次剥猪皮试验的情况是：每两人每小时至少可以剥四个猪的皮，也就是说，每人每半小时可剥一个猪，其余半小时汤猪头猪蹄，是没问题的。这样，工作所需的时间是一样的，工资也不必增加。这一点，需要有关机关注意对屠场工人进行说服教育，使他们了解国家的政策，不要受拘旧习惯，强调增加工资，以免给猪皮制革工作增加困难。
    ２、猪鬃猪毛问题：根据各地习惯，运猪赴屠场时，都在活猪身上将鬃拔下。根据东北制革厂的经验，活猪拔鬃，并不影响猪皮。原猪主尽可按旧习惯，先将猪鬃拔去。至于猪毛，过去在汤浸后，拔下交原猪主；今后可按猪只大小与得毛多少，规定价格，由制革厂酌付代价。制革厂可采用涂里法脱毛，保全猪毛，供各方应用。这样，制革厂并无任何损失。
    ３、猪皮价格方面：猪皮价格应当与猪肉相等或比猪肉便宜些，但不可太便宜。猪皮若比肉贵，则屠场可能在皮上带上许多肉；相反的，若比肉便宜太多，则猪主宁可不剥皮，或不在屠场宰猪，以免损失。这一点应考虑周到。
    ４、猪皮品质方面：大皮小皮、厚皮薄皮应一律剥取。所有猪皮，固不必求其一定能作底革，倘如薄的不剥，只剥厚的，将来一定会有偏差发生。比如改良种的猪，鬃不好，皮板薄，虽不能作底革，但可用作面革。
    ５、为了照顾屠场，假如在北京天津两地剥猪皮制革，则外埠运北京天津之猪肉，也必须剥皮。猪肉剥皮后再运，虽不大方便，但运肉来北京天津，一般都在天气冷的时候，用蒲包或芦席包运，即可解决猪肉外层油厚麻包包运不便的困难。
    ６、市民习惯问题：小城市卫生机构不健全，市民多从猪皮上鉴别是否瘟猪。但在大城市里，所有猪肉，都必须先由卫生机构检查，检查戳记盖在皮上和盖在肉上是一样的。市民买了有皮的肉，在做菜时大都（特别是炒菜时）将皮丢掉；有时买无皮的肉反而要多花钱，至于猪头肉及蹄子，这种皮不宜制革，且剥皮时也不方便，在剥皮之先另外割下，烫去毛后，可以照旧食用。有人说猪皮是为了保护猪肉不易腐坏，实际上猪皮只能保护不易腐坏之脂肪，而不能保护极易腐坏之肌肉。要买带皮的肉主要的还是市民的习惯问题。因之必须动员各级干部，各地报纸，配合各级政府，有计划有步骤地展开宣传教育，使市民食用剥皮猪肉，同时发动制革厂，使其乐于制造猪皮。
    ７、为了推广猪皮制革，建议各地税务机构，斟酌情况，在初推行期间，予猪皮以免征货物税之优待，以资鼓励。
    ８、猪皮保存问题：猪皮剥的多了，制革厂的生产力有限，有时会使猪皮堆积起来。猪皮含带油脂太多，如阴成干皮，则浸水时极为困难。为了补救这一缺点，盐务机关，供给廉价的工业盐（即加化学药品不能食用之盐）是必要的。将猪皮洗涤清洁，尽量刮去油脂后，加少许防腐剂，制成盐鲜皮或盐干皮，即可存储待用。在食盐缺乏区域，可以石灰代替食盐，制成灰板皮，储藏待用。万不可使人民剥得猪皮后，因销售不掉，或保存不善，而遭到损失，这对于推广猪皮制革，是有很大害处的。
  加强猪皮制革的宣传与推动工作
    中央人民政府轻工业部于一九五○年十二月召开全国制革工业会议时，曾号召全国制革厂利用猪皮制革，供给军需民用，以补牛皮之不足。且经大会作成议决案后，已由中央财政经济委员会批准。在此期间，专家们作了不少宣传工作。个别地区（如东北）已在实行。为了广泛推行这一政策，须尚依靠各级政府，各地报纸，各级干部，各制革厂，群策群力，深入进行宣传解释。
