　　The Patriotic Anti-American, Aid-Korea Movement of Peasants After Land Reform
    Su Jingcun, Associate Professor, Beijing Normal University
    During the last few days of our tour of the land reform in East China, we participated in a joint conference in Tongli District, Wujiang County, Southern Jiangsu, where peasants from the entire district celebrated the victory of land reform and the movement to resist America, aid Korea. We witnessed the broad masses of peasants engaged in the patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend their country after the vigorous land reform movement. That day, when we arrived in Tongli District from the county seat at around 10 a.m., peasants from various townships were streaming into Tongli Town in teams, beating gongs and drums, carrying flags, interspersed with Yangge dance teams and dragon lantern teams, joyfully reaching the meeting place. The militia teams all had their team flags and wore badges; peasant women, organized under the Women's Federation, formed large teams and also organized women's Yangge teams to participate. The meeting place was filled with red flags and equipped with loudspeakers. Nearly 20,000 peasants sat on the ground in an orderly manner. The chairman's platform was occupied by peasant representatives and representatives from all walks of life. Among the presidium was a peasant woman, wearing a blue jacket and a white towel on her head, a typical peasant costume that particularly highlighted the image of peasants who had stood up and become masters of their own affairs. After the cannons were fired, the chairman announced the opening of the meeting. The 20,000 peasants listened very quietly to the speeches from the stage. Through the education of the land reform movement in just a few months, the peasants had already demonstrated their organization and discipline. The peasant representatives used extremely sincere, simple, and moving language to express their happiness at standing up, thanking the People's Government, the Communist Party, and Chairman Mao for their leadership. They stated that they must intensify production and actively launch the movement to resist America and aid Korea in order to protect the fruits of victory they had achieved. He said, "We peasants have suffered thousands of years of oppression and pain. Today, we can stand up, which can only be achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."
    Following the speech summarizing the victory of land reform, the activity of resisting America and aiding Korea began. A middle-aged peasant woman first stepped onto the stage and angrily recounted the ordeal of her family being killed by Japanese soldiers during the War of Resistance Against Japan. She burst into tears when she spoke of her grief. Many peasants, especially those who had personally suffered from the oppression of Japanese imperialism, shed tears. Groups of peasants under the stage excitedly shouted slogans such as "Oppose America's arming of Japan, resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country." The peasant woman ended her denunciation with hateful words, saying, "I will keep an eye on the landlords in the future to prevent them from colluding with reactionaries and imperialists." Peasant masses continuously stepped onto the stage to denounce the crimes of Japanese imperialism during the War of Resistance Against Japan and firmly expressed their determination to completely eliminate the reactionaries in Taiwan, oppose America's arming of Japan, and defend their homes and country by resisting America and aiding Korea. Two elderly peasant women couldn't help but cry bitterly before they even began to denounce. The angry slogans of the masses under the stage and the cries of the denouncers on the stage intertwined. As I was thinking that the peasants had now elevated the pain they had personally suffered from imperialist oppression in the past to a political understanding and awareness, which had become a great force, a middle-aged peasant woman, with tears in her eyes, suddenly came up to me and said, "Comrade, can I go on stage and speak too?" I told her, of course, she could, and she went up to the stage. More and more people went up to the stage, and the stage was crowded with people asking to denounce. This conference gave me a very deep impression, making me realize the great power of the peasants, making me concretely realize the importance of resisting America and aiding Korea to the construction of the new China, and greatly increasing my confidence in the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea. At that time, I deeply felt that the high political consciousness and patriotic actions of enlisting in the army of the broad masses of peasant brothers were something I should learn from well.
    Before visiting the land reform, I personally would not have understood why the peasants were so eager to enlist in the army after the land reform and why they had such a deep understanding and political awareness of resisting America and aiding Korea. Especially those who have lived in the city for a long time mostly do not understand enough about class relations in rural areas. Before I went to East China to visit the land reform, a friend from Jiangnan said to me, "The lives of peasants in Jiangnan are relatively good, and landlords generally treat peasants relatively well, so the struggle will not be very intense." But when I arrived in the countryside and actually participated in the land reform movement, it confirmed that the so-called "no feudalism in Jiangnan, no local tyrants in rural areas" was completely a smokescreen by the landlord class to conceal their crimes and avoid political struggle. For example, in Xigang Township, Wujiang County, where I went, there were three local tyrant landlords (two of whom had been tried and executed by the People's Court). Their crimes were as follows: Landlord Xu Ziguang had shot or beaten to death six peasants, seized 500 mu of lake fields, seized the houses of two peasant families, and raped eleven women, one of whom died from an abortion. Landlord Tang Guilin killed peasant Jin Laohu, seized his property, and shot peasants Zhou Agen and two others. He kidnapped peasant Li Sanbao, extorted ransom money, and then shot him. He raped two women and seized one woman as a concubine. Landlord Shen Hongsheng had beaten to death four peasants, raped three women, and seized one woman. In the tall residences of many landlords in the countryside, there were private prisons and instruments of torture for hanging and beating people. Every year after the autumn harvest, in one landlord's prison, there were often twenty or thirty peasants detained for failing to pay their rent. The landlord class ruled and oppressed the peasants so fiercely and cruelly.
    The peasants who suffered the most knew very well why the landlord class could be so overbearing in the countryside, which was because the landlords had the support of the reactionary government in the past. They manipulated rural political power and local armed forces. The former pseudo-district and township chiefs were all landlords. For example, the former township chief of Xigang Township was a landlord. In Nanku Township, among the thirty-one landlord families, there were two commanders and two regimental commanders of the Kuomintang Self-Defense Force, and four pseudo-district chiefs. The landlord class was not only in league with the reactionary government, but even directly colluded with the imperialists. For example, the pseudo-township chief of Xigang Township, landlord Tang Guilin, had served as a spy for Japanese imperialism. During the land reform, the dishonest and illegal behavior of the landlord class further enhanced the political awareness of the peasants. For example, last year, when the United States landed in Incheon, Korea, the landlords spread rumors to the peasants, saying that the United States had already invaded, and the Kuomintang was about to return, and you still want to make trouble to divide the fields. Some landlords even threatened the peasants who had been allocated houses, telling them to protect the houses well and not damage them. In Southern Jiangsu, we saw photos of landlords photographing the land deeds and embankments they had handed over for preservation, dreaming that the reactionary government would come again. Landlord Tang Guilin even sneaked back from Shanghai to Xigang Township, plotting to organize the Special Agent Brigade of the Fifth Detachment of the Jiangnan Anti-Communist People's Self-Defense Army. All these counter-revolutionary and anti-people acts of the landlord class, hoping that the American reactionaries would come again so that they could exploit and oppress the peasants again, were extremely realistic lessons for the peasant masses, making the peasants concretely realize the relationship between the landlords, the reactionaries, and American imperialism, as well as the relationship between resisting America and aiding Korea and the peasants' liberation. Therefore, the peasants realistically realized that to prevent the landlords from rising again, they must completely eliminate the reactionaries, and to eliminate the reactionaries, they must overthrow American imperialism. Since the landlord class had already directly used American imperialism and the reactionaries to threaten the peasants, no problem had a more profound impact on the peasants than this.
    From visiting the land reform, I concretely realized that land reform is an important condition for building a new China and consolidating the people's regime, and that resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country is the personal requirement of the broad masses of the Chinese people. Only by resisting America and aiding Korea can we consolidate the fruits of the Chinese people's victory against imperialism and feudalism. At the same time, we must quickly complete land reform, completely eliminate the landlord class, eliminate the reactionaries, and severely suppress counter-revolutionaries, and then we can bring into play the great power of the broad masses of the people across the country to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, defend our country, and defend world peace.

　　土地改革后农民的抗美援朝爱国运动
    北京师范大学副教授  苏竞存
    我们在华东参观土地改革的最后几天，曾在苏南吴江县的同里区，参加了全区农民庆祝土地改革胜利和抗美援朝的联合大会。看到了广大的农民群众，在轰轰烈烈土地改革运动后抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国运动。那天当我们上午十点多钟由县城抵达同里区时，各乡的农民正结队的涌到同里镇，敲着锣鼓、举着旗帜，参杂着秧歌队和龙灯队，喜气洋洋的达到会场。民兵队都有他们的队旗，佩着标帜；农民妇女在妇女会的组织下，排列成大队的队伍，并另组织有妇女秧歌队来参加。大会会场上飘满了红旗，装置有扩音器，将近两万的农民，秩序井然地坐在地上。主席台上坐着农民代表和各界代表，主席团中有一位农民妇女，穿着蓝色上衣，头上包着一条白毛巾，典型的农民服装特别显出农民翻身当家的气象。鸣炮后主席报告开会了，两万农民非常肃静的倾听着台上的讲话，仅仅通过几个月来土地改革运动的教育，农民已表现出他们这样的有组织有纪律。农民代表用极其诚恳、朴素而动人的语言，说出他们翻身的幸福，感谢人民政府、感谢共产党和毛主席的领导。表示一定要加紧生产，要积极展开抗美援朝的运动，来保护已经获到的胜利果实。他说：“我们农民受了几千年的压迫和痛苦，今天得翻身，这只有在共产党在毛主席的领导下才能够做到。”
    总结土地改革胜利的讲话后，接着就是抗美援朝的活动。一个中年农妇首先走上主席台，愤怒地讲述她一家人在抗战时期被日本兵打杀的经过，说到悲痛的地方，放声大哭起来，许多农民，尤其是曾亲身受到日本帝国主义压迫的，都落泪了，台下一群一群的农民，激动的喊着“反对美国武装日本，抗美援朝、保家卫国”的口号。这位农妇用仇恨的言语结束她的控诉说：“我以后要看住地主，防他们勾结反动派和帝国主义。”农民群众连续不断地走上主席台，控诉抗战时期日本帝国主义的罪行，坚决表示要彻底消灭台湾的反动派，反对美国武装日本，要保家卫国抗美援朝。有两个老年的农妇，还没有开始控诉，就抑制不住地痛哭起来，台下群众愤怒的口号声和台上控诉者的哭声交成一片。当我正在想：现在农民把过去切身受到帝国主义压迫的痛苦，已提高到政治上的认识与觉悟，已变成伟大的力量了。忽然一个中年的农妇，含着泪走到我面前说：“同志，我也可以上台去讲讲吗？”我向她说当然可以，她走上台去了。走上台去的群众愈来愈多，台上挤满了要求控诉的人，这次大会给我很深的印象，使我认识到农民的伟大力量，使我具体地认识到抗美援朝对新中国建设的重要性，更大大地增加了我对抗美援朝胜利的信心。当时我深深地感觉到：广大农民兄弟这种高度的政治觉悟和参军的爱国行动，是我应当好好地向他们学习的。
    土地改革后的农民为什么这样踊跃要求参军，为什么对抗美援朝有这样深刻的认识和政治上的觉悟，我个人在没有参观土地改革以前，是不会了解的。尤其是常久居住在城市里的人，对农村阶级的关系，多半不够了解。在我去华东参观土地改革以前，有一个江南籍的朋友对我说：“江南农民生活比较好，一般地主待农民也比较好，斗争不会很剧烈的。”但是等我到了农村，实际参加了土地改革运动时，证实了所谓“江南无封建、农村无恶霸”的说法，完全是地主阶级希图掩蔽他们的罪恶，避免政治上斗争的烟幕。例如我所到的吴江县溪港乡，就有三个恶霸地主（其中两个已被人民法庭审判枪决），他们的罪行如下：地主徐子光曾枪杀或打死农民六人，霸占湖田五百亩，霸占农民房屋两户，强奸过妇女十一人，其中一人并因打胎致死。地主唐桂林杀死农民金老虎，夺去其财产，又枪杀农民周阿根等二人，绑架农民李三保，勒索得赎金后又枪杀了他，曾强奸妇女二人，霸占妇女一人为妾。地主沈洪生曾打死农民四人，曾强奸妇女三人，霸占妇女一人。在农村中许多地主的高大住宅内，都私设有牢狱和吊人打人的刑具，每年秋收后在一个地主的牢狱里，常常拘押着二、三十个缴不出租米的农民。地主阶级就是这样凶恶地残酷地统治和压迫着农民。
    地主阶级在农村里何以能这样霸道，身受其苦的农民是非常清楚的，就是因为过去地主们有反动派政府撑腰。他们操纵农村政权和地方武力。过去的伪区、乡长都是地主担任的，例如过去溪港乡的乡长就是地主。在南库乡，三十一户地主当中，就有国民党自卫队司令二人，团长二人，伪区长四人。地主阶级不但是和反动派政府是一气的，甚至还和帝国主义直接勾结，例如溪港乡伪乡长地主唐桂林，曾当过日本帝国主义的侦探。在土地改革期中，地主阶级的不老实不法的行为，更提高了农民的政治觉悟，例如去年当美国在朝鲜仁川登陆的时候，地主对农民大放谣言说，美国已打过来了，国民党就快要回来了，你们还要闹分田。有些地主并且还恫吓已分到房屋的农民，要农民好好的替他们保护房屋不要弄坏。在苏南我们看到了地主将缴出的田契圩册拍照以备保存的相片，还梦想反动派政府会再来。地主唐桂林并从上海潜回溪港乡，阴谋组织江南反共人民自卫军第五支队特务大队。地主阶级这一切希望美国反动派再来，他们好再剥削压迫农民的反革命反人民的行为，对农民群众是极其现实的教训，使农民具体地认识了地主和反动派和美帝国主义的关系，以及抗美援朝和农民翻身的关系。所以农民很现实地认识到，要使地主不能再起来，就要彻底消灭反动派，要消灭反动派，就必须要打倒美帝国主义。地主阶级既然已经直接用美帝国主义和反动派来恫吓农民，那么再没有比这个问题对农民影响更深刻了。
    从参观土地改革中，使我具体地认识了土地改革是建设新中国，是巩固人民政权的重要条件，抗美援朝保家卫国是中国广大人民的切身要求，只有抗美援朝才能巩固中国人民反帝反封建的胜利果实。同时必须要迅速完成土地改革，彻底消灭地主阶级，消灭反动派，以及严厉地镇压反革命，然后才能发挥全国广大人民抗美援朝保家卫国和保卫世界和平的伟大力量。
