　　Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Financial Inspection
    The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government promulgated the measures for establishing financial inspection institutions at all levels in December last year, and now has issued instructions on the key points of the inspection work of financial inspection institutions at all levels in 1951. These two measures are of great significance for doing a good job in financial work and maintaining financial discipline.
    Financial inspection work is still a new task at present. It has neither mature experience nor a complete system. In addition, the scope of inspection is wide and the inspection affairs are cumbersome. At the beginning, inspection institutions at all levels must carry out inspections with emphasis according to the actual needs, distinguishing between the important and the urgent. In order to do this work well, all relevant parties must pay attention to the following issues:
    First, the inspection institutions must collect various materials from the inspected institutions and local relevant parties in advance, analyze and study them, and formulate an inspection work plan. After arriving at the destination, they should try to obtain the help of responsible comrades from local relevant authorities and mobilize the inspected departments to participate in the inspection work. After the work is completed, they should report the inspection results to them. If the inspection is carried out in isolation, it may lead to failure.
    Second, the cadres performing inspection work should have a certain amount of work experience and political awareness. They should be humble and sincere when conducting inspections, and consult with everyone more on problems, and avoid being arbitrary. It must be understood that casually criticizing others will increase the difficulty of the work.
    Third, all levels of inspected institutions should have a correct understanding of the purpose of inspection; they must adopt a welcoming and cooperative attitude towards the inspection institutions of higher or same level. If, because there was no inspection system in the past, it is subjectively believed that the dispatch of personnel by the higher or same-level financial inspection departments to inspect the work is a distrust of themselves, and therefore a passive and resistant attitude is adopted; or if they are proud and complacent when achievements are inspected, and dissatisfied when shortcomings are inspected, the result will inevitably make the inspection work lose its positive significance. This is not allowed. All these wrong ideas must be eradicated.

### 认真作好财政检查工作

　　认真作好财政检查工作
    中央人民政府财政部于去年十二月间颁发了各级财政机关设置财政检查机构办法，现在又发出关于一九五一年各级财政检查机构检查工作重点的指示。这两项措施，对于作好财政工作，维护财政纪律，是有重大意义的。
    财政检查工作，在目前还是一件新工作，既无成熟的经验，又无完整的制度，加以检查范围广泛，检查事务繁琐，各级检查机构在开始时，必须根据实际情况的需要，分别轻重缓急，有重点地进行检查。为了作好这一工作，有关各方面必须注意以下几个问题：
    第一，检查机构必须事先搜集被检查机关和当地有关方面的各种材料，加以分析研究，作出检查工作计划。到达目的地后，应设法取得当地有关机关负责同志的帮助，并发动被检查部门参加检查工作。工作结束后，当向他们报告检查结果。假如孤立地进行检查，就可能招致失败。
    第二，执行检查工作的干部，应有一定的工作经验和政治水平，在进行检查时，应谦虚诚恳，有问题多和大家商量，切忌独断独行。必须了解，随便指责别人，批评别人，是会增加工作困难的。
    第三，各级被检查机关，对检查工作的目的，应有正确的认识；对上级或同级检查机关必须采取欢迎与协助的态度。假如因为过去没有检查工作的制度，就主观地认为上级或同级的财政检查部门派人来检查工作，就是对自己不信任，因而采取消极抵抗的态度；或者在检查出成绩时，骄傲自满，检查出缺点时，就不满意，其结果必使检查工作失掉积极意义。这是不能允许的。所有这些错误思想必须予以根除。
