　　Responding to Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team's Patriotic Production Competition Challenge       
　　Mutual Aid Teams Across the Country Rise to the Challenge       
　　Improving Technology, Strengthening Organization, and Guaranteeing a Bumper Harvest
　　[By Our Newspaper] Rural areas across the country are now conducting or preparing for large-scale spring plowing. In order to guarantee a bumper harvest of crops this year, the mutual aid team led by Li Shunda, a well-known labor model in Shanxi Province, first launched a patriotic production challenge to mutual aid teams across the country. Since the issuance of the challenge letter from Li Shunda's mutual aid team, agricultural labor models and mutual aid teams in various regions have risen to the challenge, and a nationwide patriotic agricultural production competition movement is taking shape. Our newspaper has already published news and letters of response from some famous labor models and many mutual aid teams in North Sichuan, Heilongjiang, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Shandong, and Chahar on the second page of March 17th and the sixth page of March 28th, respectively. Here are the reports of the continuing messages received:

　　　　Shanxi: Nearly Four Hundred Groups Accept the Challenge
　　　　Many Individual Farmers Also Participate in the Competition
　　The number of mutual aid teams in various parts of Shanxi Province that have responded to the challenge from Li Shunda's mutual aid team has reached 398.
　　The enthusiastic competition movement in Shanxi Province is being carried out under the leadership of labor models with the help of local leading organs. The Agricultural Science Department of the Yushe County People's Government and the state-owned farm jointly held a small symposium of twenty-four model mutual aid team leaders, who studied in detail the mutual assistance direction of Li Shunda's mutual aid team in improving technology and combining sideline occupations, as well as the conditions for increasing production this year, and mobilized the groups to participate in the competition. The county's Agricultural Science Department, state-owned farm, and cooperative jointly organized a responsible group (an organization specifically leading and promoting the county's competition movement) to guide the county's competition movement. The Ping顺县委 (Ping Shun County Party Committee) organized more than half of its cadres to go to the countryside to create model mutual aid teams, exchange production experiences, and quickly promoted fifty-one advanced mutual aid teams to respond to the challenge from Li Shunda's mutual aid team. Now, mutual aid teams in Hejin, Wenxi, Xie County, Linfen, Anze, Piding and other counties, as well as some individually farming peasants, have also begun to respond to the challenge from Li Shunda's mutual aid team.
　　Many of the mutual aid teams in the newly liberated areas that responded to the challenge emphasized developing team members, expanding mutual aid teams, and promoting individual farmers in the village to join mutual aid teams as conditions for responding to the challenge. Ten model mutual aid teams in the old liberated areas, such as Zhang Zhiquan, Guo Yu'en, Yang Fengshan, Zhang Furen, and Guo Shiren, also proposed increasing public large-scale agricultural implements, improving old agricultural implements, and opening small farms to cultivate improved varieties to ensure high yields.

　　　　Hebei Province Labor Model Song Luoxue's Team
　　　　Guarantees an Increase of 80% per Mu Compared to Before the Challenge
　　Song Luoxue's mutual aid team, a famous labor model in Hebei Province, and the mutual aid teams led by other labor models in the province, have recently proposed terms of challenge and responded to Li Shunda's mutual aid team.
　　Song Luoxue mutual aid team, a labor model in Songjia Village, Mancheng County, Hebei Province, has challenged Li Shunda mutual aid team, a labor model in Shanxi. Song Luoxue was a representative who attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers in Hebei Province last year. His mutual aid team has a total of 72 mu of land and plans to produce an average of 340 jin of grain per mu (including cotton and other crops), an increase of 32 jin compared to last year, exceeding the pre-Japanese War yield per mu by more than 80%. The specific plans to guarantee increased production are:
　　1. 80% of the land in the team will be planted with improved varieties. 2. An average of five carts of fertilizer will be applied per mu, an increase of one cart compared to last year, with planned topdressing. 3. All land will be cultivated twice and harrowed four times; cotton will be hoed six to eight times, wheat twice (previously only hoed once), millet four times, and other crops no less than three times. 4. Prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. Millet and corn seeds will all be mixed with sodium fluosilicate to control mole crickets, and millet seeds will be mixed with Ceresan to prevent black spot. Before the first hoeing of cotton, weeds will be removed once and burned to eradicate cotton aphids. To prevent red spiders, the biggest threat to cotton, no soybeans will be planted on the ridges of all cotton fields. Prepare lime and sulfur mixture for red spider treatment. 5. Improve planting techniques. Widen row spacing and plant spacing to suit the characteristics of "Erbimian" (二比棉) branch and leaf expansion. Implement cotton seed selection and field marking for seed selection. Implement mixed planting of cotton and peanuts, mixed planting of wheat and corn, and mixed planting of cotton and garlic. Use two mu of land for corn detasseling hybridization experiments. All major crops will be field-selected to ensure that improved varieties will be used in 1952. In addition, repair an old well and plan to dig drainage ditches to prevent drought and flooding. In order to consolidate and expand the mutual aid team, the team guarantees to implement a system of equal work and equal pay this year.
　　In addition to Song Luoxue's mutual aid team, the labor models and mutual aid teams in Hebei Province that have responded to Li Shunda's mutual aid team include: Wang Qingmei mutual aid team, a female labor model in Mancheng County; mutual aid teams led by forty-five labor models, including Li Baolin, Cai Jingsheng, and Lin Shurong in Qian'an County; Lin Shiyun, a labor model in Dingfuzhuang, Ji County, and eighteen mutual aid teams led by Sun Jingyu, Li Fu, and Wang Rong in the village. The above-mentioned labor models and mutual aid teams have all formulated detailed plans for their challenges and specific methods for completing the plans.

　　　　Chahar Longguan People's Representatives From All Walks of Life
　　　　Respond to the Challenge and Guarantee Increased Production in Disaster Areas
　　The 138 representatives of the first session of the People's Congress of All Circles in Longguan County, Chahar Province, enthusiastically responded to the challenge of Li Shunda's mutual aid team and passed a resolution to lead 80,000 farmers in the county to launch a patriotic production competition. They also wrote a letter to Li Shunda's mutual aid team, which mainly said: Our county has suffered severe natural disasters for many years. Last year, agricultural production averaged only 40%. Currently, 35% of the county's population are disaster victims. Therefore, we must actively prepare for spring plowing and engage in production for self-salvation. Even under such difficult circumstances, we must still represent nearly 80,000 farmers in the county in responding to the call of the Ministry of Agriculture, closely follow you, and complete this year's agricultural production increase task. Based on the specific conditions of our county, we propose to harvest 7 dou 6 sheng 6 of grain per mu this year and strive to bring agricultural production close to the pre-Japanese War level of 8 dou per mu. In order to achieve this plan, in addition to deep plowing, meticulous cultivation, and researching and improving farming techniques, we also propose the following guarantees: (1) Continue to deeply promote the anti-American and aid-Korea current affairs publicity. (2) Actively lead the masses in production for self-salvation, mobilize social mutual assistance, ensure that no one starves to death, and ensure that production is not delayed. (3) Organize a large number of mutual aid teams to ensure that 20% of the farmers in the county are organized. (4) In order to overcome natural disasters, vigorously develop forestry construction. Afforest 100,000 mu of mountains and cultivate forests, sow 9,000 mu of barren mountains, and plant 2 million scattered trees throughout the county. (5) Guarantee that revolutionary soldiers and martyrs' families will not leave a single mu of land uncultivated, and their yield will not be lower than that of ordinary farmers. (6) Universally carry out flood prevention and silt deposition, and every household digs water storage ponds to reduce flood flow and turn water disasters into water conservancy. We hereby challenge you with these conditions.

　　　　The Challenge Conditions of Many Mutual Aid Teams in Northeast China
　　　　Emphasize Planting Industrial Raw Materials and Cash Crops
　　Eight mutual aid teams led by famous agricultural labor models in Northeast China, including Han En, Wang Zhendang, Wang Zhijian, Huang Yongde, Long Zhenquan, Zhao Qizhi, and Cui De and Yu Dexiang, special-class agricultural labor models in Songjiang Province, have recently formulated their production plans for this year and challenged Li Shunda's mutual aid team. The challenge conditions of Han En's mutual aid team are: guarantee that the average yield per mu of the whole team will reach 566 jin this year, and the total output of the whole team will increase by 8.2% compared with last year. In order to achieve this goal, the whole team decided to sow 68% of the cultivated land with industrial raw materials and cash crops, and use improved varieties. In addition to using old agricultural implements to cultivate 140 mu of hillside land, which will be cultivated four times with a shovel, the remaining 300 mu of plain land will be completely cultivated with new agricultural implements, which will be cultivated five times with a shovel. 10,000 jin of manure will be applied per mu, an increase of 1,000 jin per mu compared to last year. In addition, the whole team also plans to cover 50 mu of poor quality mountain land with black soil to turn it into fertile land. In order to consolidate and improve the mutual aid organization, the whole team will extract manpower and animal power to carry out sideline production according to the slack time of agricultural work. In terms of labor distribution, the whole team will implement division of labor and specialization according to each person's expertise. There will be four groups: new agricultural implements, old agricultural implements, paddy fields, and sideline occupations.
　　Wang Zhendang's mutual aid team proposed in its letter of challenge: Guarantee that the average yield per mu will reach 336 jin this year, an increase of 16.6% compared with last year, exceeding the highest yield before the liberation of Northeast China by 166.6%. In order to achieve the goal of increasing production, seeds must be carefully selected and germination tests must be carried out in advance. The whole team will use two sets of new agricultural implements from spring plowing to autumn harvest. The whole team also plans to set aside 50 mu of seed collection fields and 40 mu of experimental fields for studying hybrid corn. In terms of fertilization, it is required that 85% of the fertile land be manured. In addition, preparations are being made to improve 220 mu of soil and reclaim 600 mu of wasteland. During the summer hoeing period, preparations are being made to dispatch six integrated shovel and hoeing machines to ensure that the land is shoveled and hoeed three to five times. In terms of sideline production, it was decided that the whole team would extract six people to fish with three boats, with an estimated annual income of 200 million Northeast coins, and also plan to cultivate 16 horse foals and 7 calves. In order to realize the above plan, the group will check the production plan seasonally and carry out production competitions within the group. At the same time, use the method of paying according to labor to mobilize 23 women and 6 old men in the group to participate in production.
　　Wang Zhijian, Huang Yongde, Long Zhenquan, Zhao Qizhi, and Cui De, Yu Dexiang and others led six mutual aid teams, in the challenge letter proposed to ensure that this year's conditions for increasing production. In order to achieve the goal of increasing production, in addition to uniformly planning to plant more industrial raw materials and commercial grain, each group also proposed specific methods such as improving agricultural technology and expanding cultivated land area.

　　　　More Than 180 Mutual Aid Teams in Shandong
　　　　Guarantee Increased Production and Fight Against Disasters
　　Agricultural labor models from thirty-three counties in Shandong Province and the 181 mutual aid teams they lead have challenged Li Shunda's mutual aid team. They all unanimously guaranteed in their letters of challenge: consolidate and improve the mutual aid team, fight against natural disasters, improve farming techniques, and formulate specific plans to increase production based on the situation in each region. For example, Lu Hongbin, a famous labor model in Shandong Province, led three mutual aid teams in his village, challenging Li Shunda's mutual aid team with the condition that the average yield per mu this year (the land in the area is mountainous and the soil is barren) is 270 jin, an increase of 80 jin per mu compared to last year, and an increase of 80% compared to before the war. Lu Shi'an mutual aid team, a labor model in Kunyu County, proposed in its letter of challenge: Guarantee that the whole team will produce 420 jin of grain per mu this year, an increase of 110 jin compared to last year. To this end, the whole team will apply an average of 30 loads of manure (a total of 4,500 jin) and 40 jin of soybean cake per mu; and universally sow improved varieties; at the same time, the team guarantees long-term irrigation of 15 mu of land and establishes an experimental field in the team to cultivate improved varieties. 139 labor models in Rushan County collectively responded to the challenge of Li Shunda's mutual aid team, guaranteeing to lead the peasant masses in Rushan County with their practical actions, actively carry out a patriotic production competition, and complete the task of increasing the county's grain production by 20 million jin.
