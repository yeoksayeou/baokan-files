To our respected Chairman Mao:

    Our machine factory completed the production tasks for the first quarter three days ahead of schedule. Now, we are reporting the production situation to you.

    Since the Ma Hengchang Group in our factory issued a challenge to workers nationwide in January, all workshops and groups in our factory have responded enthusiastically, launching a vigorous patriotic labor emulation campaign. During the competition, lathe operator Tong Junshan, while machining drill stand columns, created a new record of increasing efficiency by thirteen times. Planer Zhao Yukun created a new record for achieving standard product quality. The Chen Yucai workshop completed the universal milling machine, which used to require 360 work hours to assemble, one-third ahead of schedule, also creating a new record. The foundry's castings, totaling 380 types, improved in quality by 98 percent. By March 28th, the first quarter's production tasks had been victoriously completed, and two universal milling machines were over-produced. 100 percent of the products were first-class quality. Fifty-nine types of tools were modified, and seventy-eight new records were created. Technical personnel improved eighty types of production forms, added twenty sets of "255" components, and eight Ma Hengchang-style advanced production groups emerged.

    Although we have completed and exceeded the production tasks ahead of schedule, we will never be satisfied with these achievements. We will further unite with technical personnel, study technology diligently, and improve the quality and quantity of products, striving to continue to complete and exceed the production tasks in the second quarter, and build a strong economic and defense power for our great motherland. We wish you good health!

        Respectfully, all workers of a certain machine factory in Northeast China. March 28th

　　马恒昌小组所在厂全体职工
    向毛主席报告第一季度生产成绩的信敬爱的毛主席：
    我们机器厂提前三天完成了第一季度的生产任务，现在把生产情况向您报告。
    自一月份我们厂里的马恒昌小组向全国工人提出挑战后，我们全厂各车间、小组也纷纷应战，展开了轰轰烈烈的爱国主义劳动竞赛运动。在竞赛中，车工佟俊山车台钻立柱座，创造了提高效率十三倍的新纪录。大刨工赵玉昆创造了达到标准产品质量的新纪录。陈毓材车间把过去需要三百六十工才能装成的万能铣床，提前三分之一的时间完成，也创造了新纪录。翻砂场的铸件三百八十种，提高质量百分之九十八。到三月二十八号，第一季度的生产任务已经胜利完成，并且超额生产了两台万能铣床，产品质量百分之百都是一级品，改造了五十九种工具，创造了七十八种新纪录，技术人员改进了八十种生产表格，增制了“二五五”部件二十套，出现了八个马恒昌式的先进生产小组。
    我们虽然提前完成和超额完成了生产任务，但是我们决不因有了这些成绩而满足，还要进一步团结技术人员，钻研技术，提高产品的质量、产量，争取在第二季度继续完成和超过生产任务，建设我们伟大祖国的强大的经济力量和国防力量。谨祝您身体健康！
        东北某机器厂全体职工谨启  三月二十八日
