　　《Who Are the Most Lovable People》Has Deeply Educated Us

　　Letter from all the staff of the Beicheng Power Station of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau to the Editor:
　　After reading Comrade Wei Wei's "Who Are the Most Lovable People" on April 11, we learned that our volunteer comrades fought tenaciously against the invaders even when their bodies were engulfed in flames after the enemy dropped gasoline bombs, and finally annihilated the enemy. Our volunteer comrades jumped into the fire twice to rescue the Korean people in the fire. This spirit of self-sacrifice deeply moved us. We believe that such noble qualities can only be possessed by people under the leadership of the Communist Party. We further know that the reason they fight so bravely is precisely for us to live a peaceful and happy life. Precisely because of this, we believe that our soldiers are incomparably great and lovable.
　　Dear Editor, please convey a few words to our volunteer comrades on our behalf: We will definitely meet the challenge conditions of the Ma Hengchang Group, ensure safe power supply, and eliminate all accidents; consolidate our rear and actively support them to show our love for them. And extend our warmest greetings to them.
　　With best regards
　　　　　　All the staff of the Beicheng Power Station of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau

　　Letter from Bai Zhilan et al., Senior Three Class One, Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School to the Editor:
　　After we finished reading the Korean newsletter "Who Are the Most Lovable People" on April 11, do you know how excited our emotions were? We seemed to see the soldiers on the Korean battlefield, fighting the enemy with bayonets for our happiness; we also seemed to see our soldiers, wearing clothes ignited by fire, rushing towards the enemy. They hugged the enemy and burned to death with them. We also saw the volunteer soldiers, filled with noble qualities of internationalism, rescuing Korean children from the fire pit without regard for their own safety!
　　We recited it again and again, moved to tears.
　　We deeply realize how beautiful and noble the qualities of our soldiers are. Indeed, they are the most lovable people!
　　Whether we are sitting in a clean classroom listening to lectures, whether we are playing on a sunny playground, whether we are holding up our rice bowls, or lying in bed resting, we always feel that we are living in a happy country, and we are always proud and honored to have them!
　　These heroic images will always inspire us to study hard.
　　We assure the soldiers on the Korean front: We will definitely study hard, do a good job in propaganda, and work hard to support their heroic struggle. If the motherland needs us there, we will unhesitatingly obey the needs of the motherland!
　　Dear Editor: I hope you will convey our feelings to our volunteer comrades. Regards
　　　　　　Students of Senior Three Class One, Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School

　　《谁是最可爱的人》深深地教育了我们
    北京电业局北城发电站全体职工来信编辑同志：
    我们在四月十一日读了魏巍同志写的《谁是最可爱的人》后，知道了我们的志愿军同志，在敌人投下汽油弹满身被火烧着时，还向侵略者作顽强的斗争，终于把敌人歼灭。我们的志愿军同志们为了要急救火中的朝鲜人民两次跳进火坑。这种自我牺牲的精神，深深地感动了我们。我们认为，像这样崇高的品质，只有在共产党领导下的人民才可能有。我们更知道他们所以这样英勇的战斗，正是为了我们过和平幸福的生活。也正因为如此，我们认为，我们的战士是无比的伟大和可爱的。
    编辑同志，请你代我们转给志愿军同志们几句话：我们一定作到马恒昌小组的应战条件，保证安全供电，消灭一切事故；巩固我们的后方，积极支援他们，以表示对他们的热爱。并向他们致以最亲切的慰问。
    此致敬礼
          北京电业局北城发电站全体职工
  北京市第一女子中学高中部三年级一班白治兰等来信编辑同志：
    当我们读完了四月十一日《谁是最可爱的人》这篇朝鲜通讯后，你知道我们的感情是怎样的激动着？我们好像看到在朝鲜战场上的战士，为了我们的幸福，正和敌人拼刺刀；我们也好像亲眼看到我们的战士穿着被火燃着了的衣服，扑向敌人。他们抱紧了敌人和敌人一块烧死。我们也看到了充满国际主义高贵品质的志愿军战士们，奋不顾身地从火坑里救出了朝鲜的孩子！
    我们一遍又一遍的朗诵着，感动得流出了热泪。
    我们深刻地认识到我们战士的品质是多么美丽和高贵，的确，他们是最可爱的人！
    无论我们坐在洁白的教室里听讲，无论我们在阳光充沛的操场上游戏，无论我们端起饭碗，或者是躺在床上休息的时候，我们永远感觉到我们是生活在幸福的国度里，永远因为有了他们而感到骄傲与光荣！
    这些英雄的形象，将永远鼓舞着我们努力学习。
    我们向朝鲜前线的战士们保证：一定努力学好功课、做好宣传工作、努力来支援他们的英勇斗争，如果祖国需要我们到那儿，我们就毫不犹疑的服从祖国的需要！
    编辑同志：希望你把我们的心情转达给我们的志愿军同志们。敬礼
            北京市女一中高三级一班学生
