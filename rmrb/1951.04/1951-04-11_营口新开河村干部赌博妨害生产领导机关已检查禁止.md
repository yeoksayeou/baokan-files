　　Yingkou Xinkaihe Village Cadres Gambling Hinders Production; Leading Organs Have Inspected and Prohibited It
Editor:
Some village cadres in Xinkaihe Village, Hongcao District, Yingkou County, Liaodong Province, do not properly lead the masses in production, but often gather to gamble. Li Zhende, the village production committee member, lost 2.7 million yuan (Northeast currency; same below) and a pig in gambling. He also hosted Pai Gow games. Wang Yongge, the deputy secretary of the village's Communist Party branch, not only failed to persuade and educate against this phenomenon and strictly prohibit it but instead indulged it, saying, "A little gambling doesn't matter!" He himself has also participated in gambling. Some farmers have even lost their capital for production. Farmer Wang Guangyi lost 1,000 jin of sorghum intended for buying livestock, as well as an additional 2.3 million yuan. As a result, the leadership of production in the village has become laissez-faire. Upright farmers in the village are very dissatisfied with this. Some people say behind their backs, "Party members and cadres taking the lead in gambling is really outrageous."
This matter has now attracted the attention of county-level leaders. In order to correct this unhealthy trend, the Yingkou County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the County People's Government have instructed all districts to conduct inspections and strictly prohibit it.
　　    A Reader from Yingkou County
Editor's Note: The fact that some village cadres in Xinkaihe Village are leading gambling, hindering production, affecting work, and undermining the unity of the masses is extremely bad. This phenomenon should be immediately prohibited. County and district leaders should strictly educate them, rectify the work in the village, and immediately lead the masses in spring plowing and production.

专栏：来信摘要

　　营口新开河村干部赌博妨害生产领导机关已检查禁止编辑同志：
    辽东省营口县红草区新开河村某些村干部，不好好领导群众生产，却常常聚赌。该村生产委员李振德，赌博输了二百七十万元（东北币，以下同）和一口猪，他还放过牌九局。该村中共支部副书记王永革对于这种现象，不但不进行说服教育和严厉制止，反而放纵地说：“小玩一半回不算事！”他自己也参加过赌博。有些农民连生产的垫本也输了，农民王广义把准备买牲口的一千斤高粱输光，另外还输了二百三十万元。因此，该村的领导生产，形成自流状态。村里的正派农民对此甚为不满，有人在背后说：“党员、干部带头赌博，真是太不成话了。”
    此事现已引起县级领导上的注意。中共营口县委员会和县人民政府，为了纠正这种不良风气，现已指示各区进行检查并严厉禁止。
　　    营口县一读者
    编者按：新开河村某些村干部领导聚赌妨害生产，影响工作，破坏群众团结，是极端恶劣的。这种现象应该立即禁止。县区领导上应对他们严格进行教育，并整顿该村的工作，立即领导群众，进行春耕生产。
