　　The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated on March 20 the order on the recovery of local circulation notes of the Northeast Bank and the local circulation notes of the Inner Mongolia People's Bank. This is a further unified measure following the unified financial revenue and expenditure and management last year. Now, on the liberated land, except for Xinjiang, the national currency system has been completely unified. This will play a significant role in restoring and developing the national economy and facilitating the exchange of goods between customs and outside.
    Why unify the currency system of Northeast and Inner Mongolia now? This is because, under the circumstances of stable national prices, rapid recovery and some development of industry and agriculture, universal increase in people's purchasing power, and urgent need for smooth exchange of national goods, maintaining an independent currency system in the Northeast region has become an obstacle to the exchange of goods. Therefore, the decision to unify the currency system of Northeast and Inner Mongolia is timely.
    The reason why the Northeast region's currency system was not unified with the Renminbi when the Central People's Government was established was based on the needs of the time. Because the Northeast region was liberated earlier, prices had stabilized first, while the War of Liberation in Guannei had not yet been completely concluded, and efforts were still needed to stabilize prices. In order to enable the Northeast region to recover production and carry out construction as early as possible without being affected by the war and unstable prices in Guannei, so as to better support the whole country financially and economically, it was decided at that time to temporarily maintain the original independent currency system in the Northeast. Facts have proved that this measure was completely correct at the time, which not only facilitated the rapid recovery and development of the Northeast region's economy, but also created important favorable conditions for the development of the national economy. This is in line with the interests of the people of the whole country.
    Unifying the currency system is a complex task. After the currency system is unified, the obstacles to the exchange of goods between Guannei and outside caused by different currency systems will of course no longer exist. However, in order to avoid the sharp price differences of some commodities due to the non-unified currency system, and the sudden impact caused by the sudden unification of the currency system, which may cause unnecessary impact on industry and commerce, the government has decided to temporarily adopt appropriate management for a very small number of goods, and then gradually move towards a stage of smooth exchange. This is also completely necessary.
    The unification of the currency systems of Northeast and Inner Mongolia once again shows that the People's Government is not only a government that is faithful to the interests of the people, but also the most effective government. Under the old regime, major issues that were considered very complicated and involved conflicting interests can be resolved with just one order under the leadership of the Central People's Government. This also shows that a government that aims at the interests of the vast majority of the people and is therefore supported by the broad masses of the people is the most authoritative government in the world. Under the leadership of such a government, the people will continue to create new miracles.

### 统一币制，进一步沟通关内外物资交流

　　统一币制，进一步沟通关内外物资交流
    中央人民政府政务院于三月二十日颁布了关于收回东北银行地方流通券及内蒙古人民银行地方流通券的命令，这是继去年统一财政收支与管理后，进一步的统一措施。现在，在已解放的国土上，除新疆外，全国币制已经完全统一了。这对于恢复和发展全国经济，便利关内外物资交流方面，将发生重大作用。
    为什么要在现在来统一东北和内蒙古的币制呢？这就是因为在全国物价稳定、工农业迅速恢复并有若干发展、人民购买力普遍提高、全国物资迫切需要顺利交流的情况下，东北区保持独立币制已成为物资交流的障碍。因此，决定统一东北和内蒙古币制，是切合时宜的。
    东北区币制在中央人民政府成立时之所以没有与人民币统一，是根据当时的必要。因为东北全区解放较早，物价已首先稳定，而此时关内解放战争尚未完全结束，稳定物价尚待努力。为了使东北地区不受关内的战争及物价不稳的影响，能够及早恢复生产进行建设，以便更好地在财政经济上支援全国，故在那时决定暂时保持东北原来的独立币制。事实证明，当时这一措施是完全正确的，不仅有利于东北区经济的迅速恢复与发展，而且也给全国经济发展创造了重要的有利条件，这是符合于全国人民利益的。
    统一币制，是复杂的工作。在统一了币制之后，关内外的物资交流，凡因币制不同而来的障碍，当然已不存在。但为了避免由于币制不统一而形成某些商品的悬殊价格，因币制突然统一而发生过猛的冲击，以致工商业遭受不必要的影响起见，政府已决定对极少数几种物资，暂时采取适当的管理，然后逐渐走向平稳交流的阶段，这也是完全必要的。
    东北和内蒙古币制的统一，又一次说明人民政府不仅是忠实于人民利益的政府，而且是最有效能的政府。在旧政权下，被认为十分繁难，利害纠缠的重大问题，在中央人民政府领导下，只须一纸命令，即可加以解决。这也说明以最大多数人民利益为目的，因而为广大人民拥护的政府，是世界上最有权威的政府。在这种政府领导下，人民将不断创造新的奇迹。
