Strive to Popularize the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement

　　CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee's Plan for Welcoming the "May Day" Demonstration and Popularizing and Deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement

　　(I) Mobilize and Organize Every Cadre, Party Member, and Youth League Member in the Province to Stand at the Forefront of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement

　　1. Before April 10th, all 50,000 cadres, 280,000 Communist Party members, and 180,000 Youth League members above the district level in the province must, without exception, conduct a session of current affairs study. The study content will mainly be the propaganda outline for April compiled by the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee. Cadres must also study the following documents: Stalin's talk on the current international situation, the World Peace Council's declaration and resolutions, the People's Daily editorial of March 17th: "We Must Ensure That Every Place and Every Person in the Country Receives Patriotic Education of Resist America, Aid Korea," the People's Daily editorial of January 28th: "Smash the US Conspiracy to Re-arm Japan, and Strive for a Comprehensive and Just Peace Treaty with Japan," Foreign Minister Zhou's statement of February 2nd, and Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council Deputy Director Peng Zhen's report on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and punishing counter-revolutionary regulations.

　　2. Before "May Day," leading comrades at all levels and in all departments must give three political reports to their subordinate cadres (which must be combined with current production and the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries): one at the beginning of the cadre study; one after the study when organizing cadres to publicize to the masses; and one before the "May Day" demonstration. They must also lead by example, personally participating in propaganda and demonstrations.

　　3. From April 1st to May 1st, party branches and Youth League branches in both urban and rural areas must hold at least two to three special meetings to discuss party and league members' study, propaganda, and participation in the "May Day" demonstration regarding Resist America, Aid Korea. Each party and league member must guarantee to conduct propaganda and mobilization work among at least ten people and personally lead them to participate in parades and demonstrations.

　　(II) Mobilize and Organize All Cadres and All Propaganda, Education, and Cultural Institutions to Launch a Large-Scale Resist America, Aid Korea Propaganda Movement

　　1. Organize 600 cadres (including reporters) from provincial-level agencies to give political reports to the masses in Taiyuan City and in Yangqu, Jinyuan, Yuci, Taigu, and other counties in batches before April 15th.

　　2. The spring plowing inspection teams, Linfen work teams, and all other cadres sent to the countryside and factories by provincial-level agencies must use forums, lectures, and other methods to conduct Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education among the masses. Each person must conduct propaganda among at least 300 people and lead them to participate in Resist America, Aid Korea activities, such as signing, voting, establishing patriotic pacts, and participating in parades and demonstrations. They should also play a leading role in the surrounding factories and mines or villages.

　　3. Provincial-level agencies should organize three mobile propaganda teams. One will go to the industrial and mining area of Yangquan, and two will go to the rural areas of Linfen and Yuncheng. The propaganda teams must be equipped with reporters, small song and dance troupes, and carry various charts, exhibits, radios, amplifiers, and small movie projectors and other propaganda tools. Within one month, each mobile propaganda team must conduct propaganda among at least 30,000 to 50,000 people. And they must help and mobilize all possible propaganda forces in the local area.

　　4. From April 1st to May 1st, Shanxi Daily and Shanxi Peasant Daily must dedicate a "Striving to Ensure That Every Place and Every Person in the Province Receives Patriotic Education of Resist America, Aid Korea" column in each issue, continuously reporting the plans, dynamics, experiences, and problems of Resist America, Aid Korea in various cities, counties, towns, and industrial and mining areas. Shanxi Daily should write five editorials on Resist America, Aid Korea and welcoming "May Day," and Shanxi Peasant Daily should also write two on this topic. From April 1st to May 1st, Shanxi People's Broadcasting Station must have Resist America, Aid Korea programs every day, and organize responsible comrades from provincial-level agencies and labor models to give speeches twice a week. The theme of literary and artistic programs should be Resist America, Aid Korea and welcoming "May Day," and cadres should be taught to learn and sing Resist America, Aid Korea songs.

　　5. Before "May Day," all large, medium, and small schools in the province should organize propaganda teams to conduct propaganda among the nearby masses without hindering regular classes. Folk schools and workers' spare-time schools should spend fifteen to twenty minutes reading the newspaper before each class. Cultural centers in each county should use lantern slides, exhibitions, broadcasting, drama, and other propaganda methods to promote Resist America, Aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and promote the production movement. The Taiyuan Railway Administration should equip each train with propagandists as much as possible to conduct propaganda among passengers.

　　(III) Launch Broad Masses of People to Participate in Various Practical Actions of Resist America, Aid Korea

　　1. Launch people from all walks of life to universally establish patriotic pacts. The pacts should be specific, concise, and easy to implement. For those that have already been established, check the implementation status once before "May Day."

　　2. Launch the masses to universally participate in signing in support of the World Peace Council's declaration on concluding a peace pact and voting against US imperialism's rearmament of Japan (for simplicity, signing and voting can be replaced by raising hands). Signing and voting should be carried out with emphasis before April 15th to create experience; from April 15th to "May Day," it should be universally carried out throughout the province. Strive for 50% of the people in the province to participate. Strive for 100% participation from agencies, troops, factories, and schools. From the 15th to May 1st, local (city) and county party committees should assist and supervise the local People's Resist America, Aid Korea Association and report the number of signatures and votes to the Shanxi Provincial People's Resist America, Aid Korea Association every five days for timely statistics and reporting.

　　3. Launch the urban and rural people to hold a "May Day" Labor Day Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic grand demonstration. Strive for 150,000 people to participate in Taiyuan City; each county's plains areas will hold demonstrations by district, striving for 30% participation; mountainous areas will hold demonstrations by key villages, striving for 40% participation.

　　The above three actions should be the result of the masses' increased ideological awareness and high patriotic enthusiasm. Prevent any tendency towards commandism and formalism.

　　(IV) Supply Propaganda Materials in a Timely and Large Quantity

　　1. The content of the Propaganda Handbook for April of the Provincial Party Committee will focus on popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and welcoming "May Day." Party committees at the county level and above can compile supplementary materials based on this. Newspapers and radio stations should provide propaganda materials in a timely manner. Shanxi Daily should provide propaganda materials three to four times a week, and Shanxi Peasant Daily once per issue.

　　2. Compile and print 500,000 small leaflets. Print portraits of leaders, ensuring that each district has a set. Print 20,000 copies each of the Development Trend Map of the Korean War, the Asian Political Situation Map, and the World Political Situation Map, ensuring that each administrative village and each factory has one.

　　3. The Shanxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles is required to compile and select songs to popularize the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, create reportage literature and various small operas, draw 100,000 copies of Resist America, Aid Korea row paintings, and compile and print large quantities of comic strips and picture books.

　　(V) On Leadership and Inspection

　　1. The key to popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement lies in in-depth inspection. All provincial-level cadres going to the countryside and factories must be responsible for inspecting the Resist America, Aid Korea work in their localities and must report to the Provincial Party Committee twice before "May Day." Local committees, city committees, and county committees must also dispatch cadres to their subordinate areas in batches in mid-April to conduct inspections and provide assistance, paying particular attention to concentrating efforts to help backward areas. Cities, counties, and industrial and mining areas must convene a representative conference on Resist America, Aid Korea before April 15th. This conference will be convened by the local People's Resist America, Aid Korea Association (those who have not yet established this organization will be convened by the local Party Committee in conjunction with all sectors and people's organizations). Party committees at all levels must personally participate and lead in order to thoroughly understand the situation of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, discover backward corners and strata, and exchange experiences through this meeting.

　　2. Party committees at all levels, down to the grassroots party organizations, must formulate specific plans for popularizing and deepening Resist America, Aid Korea before April 10th, and promote and lead people's organizations, people's representative conferences at all levels, and Resist America, Aid Korea representative conferences to formulate plans separately.

　　3. Before April 25th, cities, counties, and industrial and mining areas should train Resist America, Aid Korea activists in batches, for one or two days. Special attention should be paid to training women, business people, and religious activists.

　　4. Party committees at the district level and above must unite with all sectors and people's organizations to establish a "May Day" Grand Demonstration Preparatory Committee to unify the organization of local propaganda forces and prepare all work related to parades and demonstrations.

　　5. In this Resist America, Aid Korea popularization movement, party committees at all levels must pay close attention to giving full play to the role of reporters and propagandists, earnestly completing the provincial party committee's plan for developing the propaganda network; and make a summary before May 10th and report it level by level. At the same time, pay close attention to reporting work. In addition to requiring the Xinhua branch to make specific plans, local areas are also required to make specific reporting plans.

　　6. Local and city committees must submit three reports to the provincial committee before May 10: one on the plan; one on the ideological review of Resist America, Aid Korea within and outside the party; and one on the summary of the "May Day" grand demonstration.

            （二）动员组织一切干部及所有宣传教育文化机构，开展大规模的抗美援朝宣传运动
    一、组织省级各机关干部六百人（包括报告员），于四月十五日以前，分批在太原市并到阳曲、晋源、榆次、太谷等县，向各该地群众做一次政治报告。

    四、山西日报、山西农民报，自四月一日至五月一日，每期须辟“为全省每处每人受到抗美援朝爱国教育而斗争”专栏，连续报道各市、县、镇及工矿区抗美援朝的计划、动态、经验和问题。山西日报应写五篇有关抗美援朝和迎接“五一”的社论，山西农民报也应就此写两篇。山西人民广播电台，从四月一日到五月一日，每日都要有抗美援朝的节目，每周须组织省级各机关负责同志和劳动模范讲演两次。文艺节目以抗美援朝和迎接“五一”为主题并且要教群众干部学唱抗美援朝歌曲。
    五、“五一”以前，全省大中小学校，在不妨碍正课的原则下，组织宣传队向附近群众进行宣传。民校和工人业余补习学校，在每次上课前，要以十五分钟到二十分钟的时间读报。各县文化馆要利用幻灯、展览、广播、戏剧等宣传方式，进行抗美援朝、镇压反革命、生产运动的宣传。太原铁路管理局尽可能在每次列车上，配备宣传员，向旅客进行宣传。

    以上三项行动，应当是群众思想觉悟提高和爱国热情高涨的结果。要防止任何命令主义和形式主义的偏向。
            （四）及时地大量地供给宣传资料
    一、省委宣传部四月份宣传手册的内容以普及深入抗美援朝运动、迎接“五一”为中心。县以上各级党委可按此编印补充资料。报纸、广播电台要及时供给宣传资料。山西日报每周要供给宣传资料三次至四次，山西农民报每期一次。

    二、各级党委直至党的基层组织，在四月十日前，均须制订普及与深入抗美援朝的具体计划，并推动与领导各人民团体、各界人民代表会议、抗美援朝代表会议等分别制订计划。
    三、四月二十五日以前，各市、县及工矿区，要分批集训抗美援朝积极分子，时间一天或两天，其中特别注意训练妇女、商民及宗教界的积极分子。
