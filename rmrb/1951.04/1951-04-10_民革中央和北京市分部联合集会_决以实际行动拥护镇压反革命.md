　　The Central Committee and the Beijing Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Jointly Held a Meeting:
　　Resolved to Support the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries with Practical Actions
　　[This newspaper reports] The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, in order to centrally demonstrate the party members' firm will to suppress the counter-revolutionary movement and to enhance ideological education, convened a "Conference to Support the Suppression of the Counter-Revolutionary Movement and Strengthen Ideological Education within the Party" on the first day of the month jointly with the Beijing Branch of the party. The meeting was presided over by Li Jishen, Chairman of the party, with a total of 223 central committee members, united committee members, and party members of the Beijing Branch in Beijing.

　　Li Jishen delivered a speech first, emphasizing that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is a political task of the people, and citing Article 7 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, he explained that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries cannot be separated from the people's revolution and national construction. He said that since the promulgation of the Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, there is now a powerful weapon for suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang must strengthen ideological education within the party, and use various methods to support the government's policies and measures with practical actions. Secondly, Li Jishen stated that the practical actions of the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang are still insufficient, and the organizational discipline is not strict enough, so that the special agent bandit Yang Shoude was able to infiltrate through deception and trickery. We should conduct a thorough self-criticism and raise vigilance. Finally, he asked every comrade to improve their ideological understanding, thoroughly understand that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is a resolute and fierce class struggle, and is a long-term, arduous, and complex political task. Every comrade must assist the government, report counter-revolutionary elements, and widely publicize to the masses. Concentrate the power of the masses to jointly exert the effectiveness of the suppression of counter-revolutionary movement. Next, Wang Kunlun, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department of the party, made a report (the full text of which is on the third page of this newspaper). Ning Wu, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the party and Convener of the Beijing Branch Committee, spoke. He reported on the process of discovering that reactionary bandits had infiltrated the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang since December of last year, and the decision of the Municipal Committee to clear them out. He said: "Yang Shoude, this heinous bandit and special agent ringleader who has been executed, pretended to be progressive, and used feudal teacher-student relations to deceive his teacher to introduce him to the party. He also forged underground work certificates and infiltrated the organization through various deceptive means." He pointed out that some individual registered special agents and reactionary party and league members under control had also infiltrated the party organization. He said: "It is a great mistake for some counter-revolutionary elements who pretended to be progressive and elements with political problems to infiltrate the organization temporarily. Today, on behalf of all comrades of the Municipal Committee, I publicly acknowledge our own mistakes. In addition to expelling this group of bad elements from the party, we have also arranged two weeks of study for the group, held two report meetings, and an expanded symposium to strengthen our education on the suppression of counter-revolutionary movement. All the introducers, group discussion members, group leaders, organization group, standing committee, and committee members of the expelled counter-revolutionary elements have made written self-criticisms at different levels, summarized the experiences and lessons, and submitted them to the Central Committee and distributed them to various groups for discussion. ... Finally, we still ask the Central Committee to give us the due punishment."

　　During the free speech session, Chen Shaoxian, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the party, proposed to strengthen organization and ideology, and the burden of various feudal backward relations must be discarded. Chen Qiyuan, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the party, said indignantly: "Chiang Kai-shek has committed numerous evils for more than 20 years and learned a set of fascists. Finally, he jointly established the 'Sino-American Cooperative Organization' with American imperialism, a special agent organization that harmed the people. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang must be particularly vigilant and smash this harmful thing in order to consolidate our organization. After this cleaning, a fresh face is not a shame but an honor. What is there to be afraid of in suppressing counter-revolutionaries? The fear is that the position is unstable." Zhang Bin said: "My lover, Sui Lu, and Yang Shoude were classmates more than ten years ago. Our two families lived on the same street. Three days after Yang was arrested, Sui Lu was also arrested. Sui Lu and I have been married for many years. At first, I did not realize that Sui Lu was a counter-revolutionary. I am a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and a revolutionary. I firmly support the government's policies. From now on, he and I have become hostile. After Sui Lu was arrested, the comrades of the Public Security Bureau inquired me and told me to do business with peace of mind. Now Yang has been executed, and Sui Lu is still in prison, but I have not been implicated, which proves that the People's Government will never wrong good people. We must trust the government and draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves. I can no longer let the relationship between husband and wife drag on, I want to divorce him. I request the government to kill if he should be killed according to the Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, and cut if he should be cut. I will never feel sorry for him!" Li Jun reviewed the mistake he had made in introducing a special agent under control to participate in the work of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. He hoped that the comrades of the party would take him as an example and wage a resolute struggle against ideological enemies; and asked the party organization to punish him. Deng Zhexi of the Beijing Branch of the party reviewed his "benevolent views", "pacifist ideas" and "personal selfishness" of taking care of himself, and then, based on the unanimous ideological understanding and the emotion of hating counter-revolutionaries and cherishing the organization, he proposed to formulate an agreement on "Supporting the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionary Movement and Consolidating the Organization" on the spot. The original text of the agreement is:

　　1. Resolutely support and actively implement the government's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries; 2. Strictly prevent counter-revolutionary elements from infiltrating our party and consolidate the party's organization; 3. Resolutely oppose benevolent views, pacifist ideas, one-sided leniency and sentimentalism, and eliminate the vague thinking of not distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves; 4. Resolutely remove all arrested and controlled elements without people's rights from the party; 5. Resolutely do not introduce any elements with unclear history or unclear political outlook to the party; 6. Resolutely support the decision of the Beijing Branch to expel the arrested and controlled elements.

　　After he made this proposal, Mei Gongbin concluded: "Today's conference is actually a review meeting, and the speeches are universal, enthusiastic, and frank. There are still more than a dozen comrades who want to speak, but the meeting time has exceeded the scheduled one hour, so it can only end here. Now I propose three suggestions: First, accept the instructions of Chairman Li Jishen and agree to the reports of Minister Wang Kunlun and Comrade Ning Wu, the head of the Municipal Branch, as the resolutions of the conference; second, agree to the six articles of the agreement proposed by Comrade Deng Zhexi as the agreement of Beijing party members; third, use the experience and spirit of this Beijing party members' congress to promote it to organizations throughout the country and launch a party-wide movement." Chairman Li Jishen of the party then asked everyone for their opinions, and it was immediately unanimously approved in the thunderous applause of the audience.

　　民革中央和北京市分部联合集会
　  决以实际行动拥护镇压反革命
    【本报讯】中国国民党革命委员会中央为了集中表现该党党员对镇压反革命运动的坚决意志和提高思想教育，一日与该党北京市分部联合召集“拥护镇压反革命运动加强党内思想教育大会”。会议由该党李济深主席主持，共到该党在北京的中央委员、团结委员和北京市分部的党员二百二十三人。
    李济深首先致词，他强调镇压反革命是人民的政治任务，并引证中国人民政协共同纲领第七条，说明镇压反革命与人民革命、建国不能分开。他说自从公布惩治反革命条例后，在镇压反革命上更有了一个强有力的武器。民革同志要加强党内思想教育，用各种各样的方式方法，以实际行动，来拥护政府的政策与措施。其次，李济深说明，民革同志的实际行动还不够，组织纪律也还不够严密，以致特务匪徒杨守德能以欺骗诡计钻入，应当痛自检讨，提高警惕。最后要求每一同志提高自己的思想认识，彻底了解镇压反革命是一种坚决而激烈的阶级斗争，是长期的，艰巨的，复杂的政治任务。每一同志必须协助政府，检举反革命分子，并向群众广为宣传。集中群众力量，共同发挥镇压反革命运动的效能。次由该党中央宣传部王昆仑部长作了报告（全文见本报第三版）。该党中央常务委员兼北京市分部委员会召集人寗武讲话。他报告了自从去年十二月发现反动匪徒混入民革，经市委会决议予以清除驱逐的经过。他说：“杨守德这个罪大恶极已被枪决的土匪特务头子是伪装进步，利用封建的师生关系，蒙蔽老师介绍入党的。他并伪造了地下工作证件，以种种欺骗的手段混入组织”。他提出，又有个别的在管制中的登记了的特务分子和反动党团分子也混入了该党组织。他说：“让一些伪装进步的反革命分子和政治立场有问题的分子一时混入组织，这是我们很大的错误，今天我代表市委会全体同志们公开承认我们自己的错误。我们除了清洗这批坏分子出党外，还布置了小组两周的学习，举行了两次报告会，和一次扩大座谈会，加强我们对于镇压反革命运动的教育。所有被开除的反革命分子的入党介绍人、小组谈话人、小组长、组织组、常会、委员会都分层作了书面检讨，总结了经验教训，呈报中央并分发各小组展开讨论。……最后仍请中央给我们应有的处分。”
    在自由发言时，该党中央常委陈劭先提出要严密组织和思想，把种种封建落后关系的包袱必须丢掉。该党中央常委陈其瑗愤慨地说：“蒋介石二十多年来作恶多端、学了法西斯一套。最后又和美帝国主义合办了‘中美合作所’这个残害人民的特务机关。民革必须特别警惕，打碎这个害人的东西，才能巩固我们的组织。经过这一次的清洗，刷新面貌，这不是耻辱而是光荣。我们镇压反革命，有什么可怕呢？怕就是立场不稳。”张斌说：“我的爱人睢鲁和杨守德是十多年前的同学。我们两家同住在一条街上。杨被捕后三天，睢鲁也被捕。我和睢鲁是多年夫妻。我起初认识不到睢鲁是反革命的。我是民革党员，是革命的，我坚决拥护政府的政策，今后我和他已成了敌对关系。睢鲁被捕后，公安局同志向我进行了解以后，叫我安心做买卖。现在杨已被枪决，睢鲁尚在监禁中，我却未被连累，足证人民政府绝不会冤枉好人的。我们要信任政府，划清敌我界限。我再不能让夫妻感情拖下去，我要和他离婚。请求政府按照惩治反革命条例，该杀就杀，该砍就砍。我绝不为他难过！”李钧在会上检讨了他曾介绍一个被管制的特务分子参加民革工作所犯错误。他希望该党同志们以他为例，向思想敌人作坚决斗争；并请求该党组织上予以处分。该党北京市分部邓哲熙检讨了他的“仁慈观点”、“太平观念”以及独善其身的“个人自私”等不正确思想后，即根据全场一致的思想认识和仇恨反革命、爱护组织的情绪，提出当场订立“拥护镇压反革命运动巩固组织”公约的建议。公约原文是：
    一，坚决拥护并积极执行政府镇压反革命政策；二，严防反革命分子混入本党，巩固党的组织；三，坚决反对仁慈观念、太平观念、片面宽大和温情主义，肃清敌我不分的模糊思想；四，坚决将一切被捕和被管制没有人民权利的分子清除出党；五，坚决不介绍任何历史不清白、政治面貌不清楚的分子入党；六，坚决拥护北京市分部关于开除被捕和被管制分子的决议。
    在他提出了这建议以后，梅龚彬作结论说：“今天的大会实际上也是一个检讨会，发言普遍、热烈、坦白。现在要求发言的还有十几位同志，但开会时间已超过预定的一个钟头，只能到此结束。现在提出建议三项：第一，接受李济深主席的指示并同意王昆仑部长和市分部负责人寗武同志的报告，作为大会的决议；第二，同意邓哲熙同志提出的公约六条作为北京党员的公约；第三，以这次北京党员大会的经验与精神，推广到全国各地组织去，展开全党范围的运动。”当由该党李济深主席征求大家意见，随即在全场雷动的掌声中一致通过。
