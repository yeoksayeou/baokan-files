　　Welcoming the International Labor Day

    Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: To welcome the International Labor Day, the working people of the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia are creating new production records and engaging in enthusiastic labor competitions.
    To welcome May Day, the drivers on the Moscow-Kiev line in the Soviet Union hauled one and a half times as many heavy-load freight cars in March as in February. On March 28, Stakhanovite driver Astafiev from Legov station drove a train weighing 4,054 tons (the quota standard is 2,300 tons) and arrived at the destination on time. On the same day, Gamayunov's locomotive crew created the highest driving speed by driving a train 445 tons heavier than usual.
    The Polish working people enthusiastically responded to the competition call issued by the workers of the Pruzkow Machine Factory to welcome May Day, and a wave of setting up production tasks has swept the country. After the Polish National Committee for the Defense of Peace called on the working people to deepen the patriotic movement, the scale of the movement has expanded even further. Three hundred factories have now held meetings to strengthen production. In the city and province of Lodz, 120,000 workers have undertaken new production tasks. Advanced miners in the Silesia-Dombrowski mining area have decided to complete the annual coal mining plan by May 1st. Famous miner Makivka guarantees to complete the first three years of the six-year plan by May 1st. Workers in various industrial enterprises in Warsaw guarantee to produce extra products worth 30 million zlotys. Workers at the "Zkchetsin" steel plant guarantee to overproduce 500 tons of pig iron. The steamer "Starova Wula" guarantees to make a sea voyage with the fuel saved. The workers operating the rotary printing press at the "Polish Language Publishing House" printing plant in Warsaw pledged to save enough paper in April to print the May Day special issue of the "People's Tribune."
    Miners in the Czechoslovak brown coal mines have achieved new successes in the competition to welcome May Day. In March, the national brown coal industry completed 103.4 percent of the plan. Miners in Mosteski, using Soviet methods of organizing production, have increased their daily quota by 11.4 percent, thereby achieving a record output.

    苏波捷工人创造生产新纪录
    【新华社四日讯】苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民，正以新的生产纪录和热烈的劳动竞赛来迎接五一国际劳动节。
    为了迎接五一节，苏联莫斯科——基辅线的司机人员三月份曳引的重载货车的次数为二月份的一倍半。三月二十八日，勒哥夫站斯塔哈诺夫式司机阿斯塔费耶夫驾驶重四千零五十四吨（定额标准为二千三百吨）的列车准时到达目的地。同一天，加马攸诺夫的机车组驾驶比平常重四百四十五吨的列车创造了行车的最高速度。
    波兰劳动人民热烈响应普鲁兹科夫机器工厂工人发出的迎接五一节的竞赛号召，订立迎接生产任务的浪潮已席卷全国。在波兰全国保卫和平委员会号召劳动人民深入展开爱国运动之后，运动的规模更加扩大了。现在已有三百个工厂举行了加强生产的会议。罗兹市和罗兹州已有十二万工人承担了新的生产任务。西里西亚——顿布劳斯基矿区的先进矿工，决定到五月一日完成全年采煤计划。著名矿工马基夫卡保证到五月一日完成六年计划中头三年的工作。华沙各工业企业的工人保证生产价值三千万兹罗提的额外生产品。“兹克捷辛”钢铁厂的工人保证要超计划生产五百吨生铁。“斯塔洛华·伍拉”号汽船保证以节省下来的燃料作一次海上航行。华沙的“波兰语出版社”印刷厂操作卷筒印刷机的工人提出保证，要在四月份节省下足够的纸张，印刷“人民论坛报”的五一节专号。
    捷克斯洛伐克褐煤矿的矿工在迎接五一的竞赛中已获得新成就。三月份全国褐煤工业完成了计划的百分之一○三点四。摩斯台斯基的矿工采用苏联组织生产的方法，已将每日定额提高了百分之十一点四，由此获得了创纪录的产量。
