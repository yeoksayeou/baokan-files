　　Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd:

　　The Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Friendship Association has issued a statement condemning the British government's illegal acts of intercepting Indonesian Chinese nationals Wen Jixiang and Zhang Youjun, who were returning home by ship, in Singapore and Hong Kong on March 16th and 21st respectively. The statement points out: The British authorities in Singapore and Hong Kong's illegal interception of Wen Jixiang and Zhang Youjun this time is a despicable and shameless act of piracy in violation of international law. The statement says: Just as the people of our country are unanimously protesting with anger against the crimes of the British colonial authorities in persecuting overseas Chinese in various places, and demanding that an investigation team be sent to Malaya to investigate the situation of the refugees, the British colonial authorities in Malaya and Hong Kong have brazenly adopted the piracy methods used by the US imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and illegally arrested returning overseas Chinese in transit. This once again exposes the British government's hostility towards the Chinese people. We express our infinite indignation at the British government's despicable behavior. The statement protests to the British government, demanding that the British government immediately release Wen Jixiang and Zhang Youjun, immediately stop all measures to persecute overseas Chinese, and accept the request made by our people to send an investigation team to Malaya to investigate the situation of the refugees.

　　英帝国主义非法截捕我归侨       
    北京归侨联谊会声明抗议
    【新华社三日讯】北京归国华侨联谊会顷发表声明，谴责英国政府于三月十六日及二十一日在新加坡和香港先后截捕乘轮归国的印尼华侨温集祥和张又君二人的非法行为。声明指出：新加坡和香港的英国当局此次非法截捕温集祥和张又君，是违犯国际公法的卑鄙无耻的海盗行为。声明称：正当我全国人民对各地英国殖民当局迫害华侨的罪行一致愤怒抗议并要求派调查团赴马来亚调查难侨情况之际，马来亚和香港两地的英国殖民当局竟悍然采取了美帝国主义和蒋匪帮曾使用过的海盗手段，非法逮捕过境的归国华侨，这再一次暴露了英国政府对中国人民的敌视。我们对于英国政府这种卑劣行为，表示无限的愤慨。该声明向英国政府提出抗议，要求英国政府立即释放温集祥和张又君二人，立即停止一切迫害华侨的措施，并接受我国人民提出的派遣调查团赴马来亚调查难侨情况的要求。
