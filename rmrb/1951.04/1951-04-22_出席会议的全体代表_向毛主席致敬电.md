　　All Representatives Attending the Meeting
　　Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao

Respected Chairman Mao:

We, the representatives from Christian churches and organizations across the country, extend to you our most profound respect!

Imperialism, especially American imperialism, has long used religion as a cover to carry out cultural aggression and various despicable espionage activities against our country. It has also, for a long time, economically and administratively controlled the Chinese church, making the Chinese church its appendage and tool. The broad masses of patriotic and religious Chinese Christians are unwilling to be used by American imperialism. Today, under your wise leadership, the Chinese people have achieved liberation, and we Christians can rise up and completely shatter the shackles that American imperialism has bound us with. We thank you with boundless joy and enthusiasm, and we assure you that we will resolutely sever all ties with American imperialism, eliminate the influence of imperialist counter-revolutionaries within the church, resolutely implement the Christian Reform Movement, establish a self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating church, support government laws and decrees, actively participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement, and unite with the people of the whole country to strive for the construction of a new China.

　  向毛主席致敬电敬爱的毛主席：
    我们来自全国各地的基督教各教会各团体的代表向您致最崇高的敬礼！
    帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，利用宗教为掩护，长期对我国进行了文化侵略和各种卑鄙的间谍活动，并在经济和行政上，长期把持了中国的教会，使中国教会成为它的附庸和工具。中国广大爱国爱教的基督徒们，是不甘心为美帝国主义所利用的，今天在您的英明领导下，全国人民取得了解放，我们基督徒才能起来，将美帝国主义捆束我们的枷锁彻底打碎。我们怀着无比的快乐和热情感谢您，并向您保证：我们要坚决与美帝国主义斩断一切关系，肃清教内帝国主义反革命分子和影响，坚决实行基督教革新运动，建立自治、自养、自传的教会，拥护政府法令，积极参加抗美援朝爱国运动，并和全国人民团结一致，为新中国的建设而奋斗。
