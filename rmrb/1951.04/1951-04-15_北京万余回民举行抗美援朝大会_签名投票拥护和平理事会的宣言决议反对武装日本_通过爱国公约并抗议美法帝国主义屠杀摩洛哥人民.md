(Xinhua News Agency) According to Xinhua News Agency reports: Today, over fourteen thousand Hui people in Beijing held a meeting at the Hui People's College square to resist America and aid Korea. Participating in this meeting were Imams and elders from over fifty mosques throughout the city, masses from various Hui organizations, teachers and students from various Hui schools, Hui staff from various government offices, and Hui people from various villages in the suburbs. This was the largest gathering of Hui people in Beijing ever held.

Meeting Chairman Ma Yuhai, Professor Ma Jian of the Department of Oriental Languages at Peking University, Shan Yichang, a Hui representative from the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation, Yang Yisan, a representative from the Hui Cooperative, Yang Mingyuan, Imam of the Jiaozihuotong Mosque, and Hong Zhaofan, a representative from the beef and mutton industry, all spoke at the meeting. Ma Yuhai called on Hui compatriots in Beijing to extensively and deeply develop the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and to strive for the realization of the World Peace Council's declaration and resolutions.

The meeting unanimously passed a resolution to establish the Beijing Hui People's Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression. All Hui people participating in the meeting solemnly signed petitions to support the World Peace Council's declaration and resolutions, and agreed to oppose American imperialism's arming of Japan. They also passed the Beijing Hui People's Patriotic Pact and a "Statement Protesting the Atrocities of U.S. and French Imperialism and Supporting the People of Morocco." The statement read in part: Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, French imperialism, in order to suppress the Moroccan people's struggle for national independence, attempts to turn Morocco into a base for U.S. aggressive war. On March 2nd, they opened fire and massacred a large number of Moroccan people in Casablanca-Tadla. By March 5th, they had arrested more than 35,000 patriotic Moroccans and bombed the peaceful residents of Meknes and Fez with their air force. These atrocities have not yet ended. This inhuman brutality is a provocation against the world's Muslim people and is making enemies of all Muslims worldwide! We, all Hui compatriots, resolutely support the struggles of the Korean and Moroccan people. After the meeting, the participating Hui groups held a demonstration parade against American imperialism's arming of Japan.

　　北京万余回民举行抗美援朝大会
    签名投票拥护和平理事会的宣言决议反对武装日本
    通过爱国公约并抗议美法帝国主义屠杀摩洛哥人民
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：北京市回民一万四千余人今日在回民学院广场举行抗美援朝大会。参加这次大会的有全市五十多处清真寺的阿訇、乡老，各回民团体群众，各回民学校师生，各机关回民工作人员，及郊区各村回民。这是北京市回民从来没有过的一次大集会。
    大会主席马玉槐、北京大学东方语文系教授马坚、北京市民主妇女联合会回民代表闪懿昌、回民合作社代表杨益三、教子胡同清真寺阿訇杨明远、牛羊肉业代表洪肇范等人均在大会上先后讲话。马玉槐号召北京市回族同胞普遍深入开展抗美援朝运动，为实现世界和平理事会的宣言和决议而奋斗。
    大会一致通过成立北京市回民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会。参加大会的全体回民一致庄重地通过签名拥护世界和平理事会的宣言、决议，和赞成反对美帝国主义武装日本，并通过了北京市回民爱国公约和“抗议美法帝国主义暴行支援摩洛哥人民的声明”。声明略称：法帝国主义在美帝国主义指使下，为了镇压摩洛哥人民要求民族独立的斗争，企图变摩洛哥为美国进行侵略战争的基地。竟在三月二日开枪屠杀加斯巴——塔德拉的大批摩洛哥人民，到三月五日止，搜捕了摩洛哥三万五千多位爱国志士，并以空军轰炸麦克尼斯和非斯两城的和平居民。这种暴行迄今尚未终止。这种惨无人道的暴行是对全世界回教人民的挑衅，是与我们全世界回民为敌！我们全体回民同胞坚决支援朝鲜和摩洛哥人民的斗争。会后，参加大会的各回民团体队伍举行了反对美帝国主义武装日本的示威游行。
