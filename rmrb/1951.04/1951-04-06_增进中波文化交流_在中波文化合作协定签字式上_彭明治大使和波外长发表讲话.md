Xinhua News Agency: Ambassador Peng Mingzhi's Speech at the Signing Ceremony of the Sino-Polish Cultural Cooperation Agreement

	Premier, Honorable Ministers, Ladies and Gentlemen:

	Today, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Poland have signed the Sino-Polish Cultural Cooperation Agreement. On behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, I congratulate on the successful conclusion of this agreement.

	Both China and Poland have long cultural histories. The people of both countries have waged long and arduous struggles against imperialism and domestic reactionaries to defend their inherent splendid cultures. Now, after winning the victory in the liberation wars, the people of China and Poland are successfully building their own new cultures to serve the world's lasting peace and the freedom and prosperity of mankind, and to carry forward the excellent cultures created by their ancestors. At a time when war mongers headed by U.S. imperialism are using their reactionary and decadent cultural activities to directly or indirectly coordinate with their military, political, and economic aggression around the world, the signing of the Sino-Polish Cultural Cooperation Agreement following the signing of four agreements related to economy is of even greater significance. This shows the strengthening of the cultural power of the world peace and democracy camp. It further consolidates the friendship and unity between the people of China and Poland, enhances cultural exchanges between the two countries, and helps the construction and development of cultural undertakings in both countries. At the same time, it will also contribute to the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.

	Premier, Ambassador, Ladies and Gentlemen:

	The cultural cooperation agreement just signed between the Republic of Poland and the People's Republic of China is of great significance to the people of our two countries. The signing of this agreement was made possible by the revolutionary changes that took place in Poland after World War II; similarly, the victory of the liberation war led by Mao Zedong in China shattered feudal and imperialist yokes; it is because of these changes that the reforms in the political, economic, and cultural aspects of our two countries have been realized, and the common goals pursued by the people of our two countries have become the basis for signing this agreement. In the history of the Polish and Chinese peoples, this is the first time to exchange experiences and achievements in culture, science, education, and art with each other. This enables Poland to understand China's rich culture of thousands of years, which is currently developing vigorously in the new China, and enables China to understand Polish culture, which is based on the progressive traditions of our people and transformed into a socialist culture. Our cultural cooperation opens up avenues for our two countries to acquire new cultural treasures. This will enrich our culture and give it new weapons in the struggle against decadent cosmopolitan culture, which is a weapon used by imperialism to enslave free and independent peoples. The implementation of our cultural cooperation agreement, while realizing the Sino-Polish economic agreement, will help deepen the friendly relations between the people of Poland and China, and will help strengthen our two countries and the growth of all forces led by the mighty Soviet Union and the great Stalin in the struggle for human peace and happiness.

　　增进中波文化交流
　  在中波文化合作协定签字式上
　  彭明治大使和波外长发表讲话
    【新华社讯】彭明治大使在中波文化合作协定签字式上的讲话总理先生，各位部长先生，诸位先生：
    今天，中华人民共和国中央人民政府和波兰共和国政府之间签订了中波文化合作协定，我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府和中国人民祝贺这一协定的胜利成功。
    中国和波兰都具有悠久的文化历史，两国人民曾为保卫他们固有的灿烂的文化而与帝国主义及国内的反动派作过长期艰苦的斗争。现在中波两国人民于取得解放战争的胜利后，正成功地建设着人民自己的新文化，使其为世界的持久和平与人类的自由和繁荣而服务，并要发扬光大其祖先们所创造的优秀文化。目前以美帝国主义为首的战争贩子们正利用其反动的腐朽的文化活动，直接或间接地配合其军事、政治和经济，对世界各地肆行侵略之际，中波两国继有关经济的四个协定签字后，中波文化合作协定的签订，更有其重要的意义。这显示了世界和平民主阵营文化力量的加强，它使中波两国人民的友谊与团结更加巩固，使两国文化的交流增强，并有助于两国文化事业的建设与发展，同时它对以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营亦将有所贡献。
    【新华社讯】波兰外长在中波文化合作协定签字式上的讲话总理先生、大使先生、各位先生：
    波兰共和国和中华人民共和国之间刚才所签订的文化合作协定，对我们两国人民是具有重大意义的。这一协定签订之所以成为可能，是由于二次世界大战之后在波兰发生了革命性的变化；同样由于在中国由毛泽东所领导的解放战争获得了胜利，粉碎了封建的和帝国主义的羁绊；由于这些变革才使我们两国在政治、经济和文化方面的改革得以实现，我们两国人民所共同追求的目的成为签订这一协定的基础。在波中两国人民的历史上，这还是第一次交换彼此在文化、科学、教育及艺术上的经验与成就。这使得波兰能够认识目前在新中国猛烈发展着的中国数千年丰富的文化，这使得中国得以认识根据我国人民进步的传统而使其转变为社会主义文化的波兰文化。我们的文化合作给我们两国开辟了获得新的文化宝藏的途径。这将使我们文化丰富起来，并付予其在反对腐朽的世界主义文化的斗争中以新的武器，而这种腐朽的世界主义的文化是帝国主义企图奴役自由独立人民的一种武器。在实现为波中经济协定的同时，我们的文化合作协定也付诸实现，是将有助于加深波中两国人民间的友好关系，并将有助于我们两国的强固及由强大苏联及伟大的斯大林所领导的为争取人类和平及幸福的一切力量的增长。
