Nationwide Spring Repair Projects for Major Rivers Begin in Full Swing

The spring repair projects for major rivers across the country have now begun in full swing. The scale of this year's nationwide water conservancy spring repair projects is even larger than last year's. The total earthwork alone requires over 400 million cubic meters, and the number of migrant workers mobilized to participate in the spring repairs will reach five million. All flood control projects must be completed before the arrival of the summer flood season. According to the decision of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, this year's spring repair projects for all rivers across the country will focus on the Huai River, and irrigation projects will focus on the Northwest region.

This year's Huai River spring repair project is the first spring project for fundamentally controlling the Huai River. The entire project focuses on building mountain valley reservoirs in the upper reaches and opening up depressions for flood storage in the middle reaches. Secondly, it involves straightening river courses, dredging riverbeds, and constructing necessary dikes and culverts. Currently, several reservoir projects in the upper reaches of the Huai River have commenced construction. In the northern Anhui region of the middle reaches, more than 500,000 migrant workers have arrived at the construction site. In the lower reaches, 145,000 migrant workers have also arrived at the construction site to reinforce the Grand Canal dikes and straighten the Huai River's channel into the Yangtze River.

In the North China region, the Chaobai River, Yongding River, and Daqing River in Hebei Province are the focus of the spring repair projects. The main projects are: continuing to straighten the new channel project in the lower reaches of the Chaobai River, aiming to safely discharge 3,000 cubic meters per second of floodwater; continuing to reinforce the dikes and scour dams on both sides of the Yongding River and repairing the Yongding River's downstream flood area to protect the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway and the Beijing-Hankou Railway. On the Daqing River, it is planned to build dikes in the middle reaches of the Daqing River, open temporary diversion channels, and carry out drainage projects in the Nanliang Ditch and Wen'an Depression areas of the river. It is estimated that after the completion of this project, about 180,000 mu of land can be drained to plant wheat. In the lower reaches of the Daqing River, the sluice gate and intake gate projects for the independent sea-bound Jianhe River project will begin this spring, as well as the laying of light railways. Soil and water conservation work such as tree planting and reservoir projects will begin this spring in the upper reaches of the Daqing River and the Yongding River. The above projects, together with the annual repair projects of other rivers in North China, require a total of 34 million cubic meters of earthwork and 1,700 structures. All projects have commenced in mid-March and will strive to be completed by the end of June.

The Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Pearl River will only undergo annual repair projects this year. The Yellow River spring repair project began on March 15th, with more than 200,000 migrant workers on the dikes, planning to complete 16 million cubic meters of earthwork and 520,000 cubic meters of stonework. The Yangtze River's annual repair project focuses on strengthening the Jingjiang Dike. Currently, 60,000 migrant workers are participating in the Jingjiang Dike reinforcement project. From late February to late March, the migrant workers have completed one-half of the total earthwork of 2.65 million cubic meters. It is expected to be completed by the end of April. Because the Pearl River Basin is located in the south and the weather is warmer, the annual repair project commenced in December last year. The focus is on constructing five dikes where water accumulation inside the dikes is relatively serious, including the Xinjiang Dike, Jindong Garden, and Jinxi Garden in Gaoyao County, Xijiang River; the Duzhou Dike in Dongguan County, Dongjiang River; and the Qingxi Dike in Qingyuan County, Beijiang River. The restoration project of the Lubao Sluice on the Beijiang River is also underway at the same time. The Pearl River spring repair project is expected to be completed before the arrival of the spring flood in late April.

In northern Jiangsu, the spring repair project of the Xinyi River also started in full on March 14th. A total of 200,000 migrant workers are working on the dikes. The spring repair project mainly involves restoring the dikes and excavating the midstream channel so that the Xinyi River can safely discharge a flood flow of 3,200 cubic meters per second.

In addition, irrigation projects in various parts of Ningxia Province in the Northwest, the Dujiangyan maintenance project in western Sichuan in the Southwest, and water conservancy projects in other regions have also started in full in March and are currently being accelerated.

　　全国各大江河春修工程全面开始
    全国各大江、河的春修工程，现已全面开始。今年全国水利春修工程规模较去年尤大。全部工程仅土工一项即需要四亿公方以上，动员参加春修的民工，将达五百万人。全部防洪工程均须在夏季洪水汛期到来前完成。根据中央人民政府水利部的决定，今年全国各河的春修工程以淮河为重点，灌溉工程以西北区为主。
    今年淮河的春修工程是根治淮河的第一个春季工程，全部工程以在上游修建山谷水库，和在中游开辟洼地蓄洪为重点。其次是整理河道、疏浚河床和修建必要的堤防和涵闸等。现在，淮河上游水库工程已有数处开工，中游皖北地区到达工地的民工已有五十多万人，下游培修运河堤防，整理淮河入江水道的民工，也已有十四万五千人到达工地。
    华北区以河北省的潮白河、永定河和大清河为春修工程的重点。主要工程项目是：继续整理潮白河下游新河道工程，以安全排泄三千秒公方洪水为目标。继续培修永定河两岸大堤和扫坝工程，修浚永定河下游泛区，以保护京山铁路和京汉铁路。大清河方面，拟在大清河中游修建堤坝，开临时分洪道，和进行该河南梁沟洼和文安洼一带的排水工程，估计此一工程完成后，约可使十八万亩地脱水种麦。大清河下游，今春将开始独流入海减河工程的船闸节制闸和进水闸工程，以及铺设轻便铁道。大清河和永定河的上游今春均将开始办理植树等水土保持工作和水库工程。以上工程连同华北其他河流的岁修工程，共需土工三千四百万公方，和建筑物一千七百处。全部工程均已在三月中旬动工，并争取在六月底前完工。
    黄河、长江、珠江、今年都仅进行岁修工程。黄河春修工程已于三月十五日开始，上堤民工共有二十多万，拟作土工一千六百万公方，石工五十二万公方。长江岁修工程以加强荆江大堤为重点。现已有六万民工参加培修荆江大堤工程，自二月下旬至三月下旬，该处民工已完成全部土工二百六十五万公方的二分之一。预计四月底可完工。珠江流域因地处南方，天气较暖，在去年十二月间岁修工程即已动工。该处是以修建堤内积水比较严重的西江高要县的新江堤围和金东、金西园，东江东莞县的独洲围，以及北江清远县的清溪围等五处堤围为主。北江的芦苞水闸修复工程亦在同时进行。珠江春修工程预计在四月下旬春汛到来前即可完工。
    苏北方面，新沂河的春修工程，也于三月十四日全部开工。共有民工二十万人上堤。春修工程项目，主要是复堤和开挖中游水道，以便新沂河能够安全排泄三千二百秒公方的洪水流量。
    此外，西北宁夏省各地的灌溉工程，西南川西地区的都江堰整修工程，以及其他地区的水利工程，也已在三月间全面开工，目前正在加紧进行。
