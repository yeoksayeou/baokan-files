Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: British Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Gaitskell published the annual 1951 British Economic Survey on April 3rd. According to the London Daily Telegraph and Morning Post, this survey proves that "the British economic system has been strained to a catastrophic limit."

In this survey, Gaitskell helplessly admitted that under the policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war while following the United States, Britain's economic crisis has been worsening. He said: "In the near future, we will at least encounter: a decline in the national production growth rate, an increase in the trade deficit, a reduction in the supply of consumer goods, and a continued rise in prices." And "the main reason for this unfortunate prospect" is precisely "the rearmament of Britain and its allies in the Western world."

Gaitskell emphasized that among the difficulties caused by the rearmament of the countries of the imperialist camp, especially "the large-scale armament production in the United States," the most serious are the shortage of raw materials and the rapid rise in raw material prices. As a result, Britain's production growth rate this year will be 3% lower than in 1950. Although the demand for steel has expanded due to the need to manufacture munitions, this year's steel production will actually be lower than in 1950. Other industries using metal, such as machinery manufacturing, are in the same situation. Due to the shortage of raw material sources and the large-scale shift to military industries, a large number of civilian industries will be cut back.

In the face of rising domestic prices and the shrinking of peaceful industries, Gaitskell expressed serious concern about Britain's economic lifeline, export trade. In order to import a large number of expensive military supplies, Gaitskell estimated that this year it is necessary to increase exports to a post-war record of 2.75 billion pounds (last year's total exports were 2.2 billion pounds) in order to balance the foreign trade deficit. Gaitskell claimed that this is an "extremely difficult task."

But in reality, it is not only difficult but fundamentally impossible for Britain to balance its trade. Gaitskell himself admitted: "After losing control over the sources of raw materials, Britain will no longer be able to increase exports or control the prices of imported goods." In fact, exports have already declined sharply this year. At the end of February, the price of imported goods was 25% higher than the average price for the whole of last year, while the price of exported goods had only increased by 9%. The expansion of Britain's import surplus this year is unavoidable. Therefore, Gaitskell bleakly predicted: "Gold and dollar reserves will not only not increase, but will decrease."

The reduction in exports will make it impossible for Britain to continue to exchange for the imported raw materials and food it needs, and therefore the consequences can only be further increases in domestic prices, further shrinkage of peaceful industries, and further reductions in exports. The British economy has thus fallen into a vicious cycle from which it cannot escape due to the reasons of war preparation.

In order to escape the fate of economic collapse, the only means of the British Labour government is to intensify the exploitation of the British people, forcing them to pay for unbearable military expenditures, strengthen labor, reduce consumption, and endure a life that is becoming more and more difficult. In Gaitskell's words, the current task "places great demands on the British people in terms of energy, technology and adaptability." Regardless of the fact that prices and profits are constantly increasing, Gaitskell openly declared that wage increases will not be allowed and that the British people will have to lower their already declining living standards. He even unreservedly stated that exports will be maintained at the expense of consumers. In the future, textiles and clothing will replace coal, iron, and machinery as the main export goods. This means that the already short supply of domestic consumer goods will be even more lacking.

In the face of the "difficult, unpleasant" picture of the British economy in 1951 painted by Gaitskell, all British newspapers felt frustrated. The News Chronicle described this survey as "the bleakest of such documents in five years." All commentaries admitted one fact: "Britain is about to embark on another year of economic crisis."

　　追随美国加紧备战的恶果
    英国经济危机日深
    贾兹克尔供认将加紧剥削人民
    【新华社十四日讯】英国财政大臣贾兹克尔于四月三日发表了一年一度的一九五一年英国经济综览，据伦敦每日电讯晨邮报认为，这个综览证明“英国的经济体系已紧张到了灾难性的极限”。
    贾兹克尔在这个综览中无可奈何地供认：英国在追随美国，奉行扩军备战的政策下，经济危机已日趋恶化。他说：“我们在最近的将来至少要遇到：全国生产增加率的下降，贸易逆差的增大，消费品供应的减少和物价的继续上涨”。而“造成这个不幸的前景的主要原因”，正是“英国和西方世界的盟友的重整军备”。
    贾兹克尔强调指出，帝国主义阵营各国的重整军备特别是“美国的大规模进行军备生产”所引起的各种困难中，最严重的是原料的缺乏和原料价格的迅速上涨。其结果，英国本年的生产增加率将比一九五○年降低百分之三。钢的需要虽然因为要制造军火而扩大，但是本年的钢产量却反而要比一九五○年为低，其他使用金属的机器制造等工业，都有相同的情况。而由于原料来源短缺与大量转向军事工业的结果，大量的民用工业将受到削减。
    在国内物价高涨与和平工业萎缩的情形下，贾兹克尔对于英国经济命脉所寄的出口事业感到严重的忧虑。为了需要输入大量昂贵的军事物资。贾兹克尔估计本年必须把出口量增加到二十七亿五千万英镑的战后最高纪录（去年出口总额为二十二亿英镑），才能平衡对外贸易的差额。贾兹克尔自称这是一个“极端困难的任务”。
    但是实际上英国要在贸易上平衡收支不仅困难而且根本不可能，贾兹克尔自己就承认：“丧失了对原料来源的控制以后，英国就不再能增加出口量，或者对进口货价进行管制了。”事实上，今年以来的出口已经锐减。在二月底，进口货价格较去年全年平均价格增高了百分之二十五，而出口货价格却只增加了百分之九。英国今年入超之扩大是无法避免的。因此，贾兹克尔黯然预告：“黄金与美元储备不仅不能增加，反而要减少。”
    出口的减少将使英国无法继续换取它所必需的进口原料和粮食，因此其后果只能是国内物价的更加上涨，和平工业的更加萎缩，出口的更加减少。英国经济就这样由于备战的原因而陷入了无法解脱的恶性循环。
    为了逃避经济崩溃的命运，英国工党政府的唯一手段，就是加紧剥削英国人民，强迫他们支付不堪负担的军费、加强劳动、减少消费、忍受一天比一天困苦的生活。用贾兹克尔的话来说，当前的任务“对于英国人民在精力、技术和适应性方面有很大的要求”。贾兹克尔不顾物价与利润不断增涨的事实，公然宣称，将不准增加工资并要求英国人民还要降低早已江河日下的生活水平。他甚至毫不讳言，将以消费者的牺牲来维持出口，今后纺织品与衣料将代替煤、铁、机器而成为出口的主要货物，这就是说，已经短少的国内消费品将更感缺乏。
    在贾兹克尔为一九五一年的英国经济所描绘的“艰难的，不愉快的”图景前面，英国所有的报纸都感到沮丧。《新闻纪事报》把这个综览说成“五年来这样的文件中最黯淡的一个”。所有的评论都承认了一个事实：“英国又将走上经济危机的一年”。
