    Refusing to Accept Old Age
    Artwork by Guan Jian
    (X) Old Man Li was thinking about the past. Suddenly, there was a loud noise, and the glass was shattered. His grandson hid in Old Man Li's arms, terrified. They heard people shouting, "American imperialist planes!" "American planes are dropping bombs!"
    (XI) The American imperialists' bombing enraged the people of Victory Village. Many people signed up to join the Volunteer Army. Old Man Li also squeezed out from the crowd and volunteered to join the stretcher team. A Korean elder said, "That won't do, you're over fifty years old!"
    (XII) Old Man Li was very unhappy to hear this. He said, "My son and daughter-in-law have both joined the revolution. My son has even made great contributions. Only I have not contributed to the revolution. My body is very strong, and I work just as well as the young people. Why won't you let me go?!"

    （十）李老头正在想着过去的事情。忽然一声巨响，玻璃被震碎了。孙儿吓得藏在李老头的怀里。只听得人们喊着“美国鬼子的飞机！”“美国飞机扔炸弹了！”
    （十一）美国鬼子的轰炸，激怒了胜利村的老百姓。许多人报名参加志愿军。李老头也从人群里挤出来，自愿报名参加志愿担架队。一位朝鲜族的老乡说：“不成啊，你是五十多岁的人了！”
    （十二）李老头听了很不高兴。他说：“我儿子、媳妇都参加了革命。儿子还立了大功。只有我一人对革命没有贡献。我的身体很结实，做起活来不比年青人差，为啥不让我去？！”
