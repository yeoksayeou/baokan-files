How Certain Catholic Scoundrels Undermined the People's Revolutionary Cause
Zhu Bo

Patriotic Catholics in several regions of the country are launching a renovation movement and a patriotic movement, which is very necessary. One of the main contents of the renovation movement is to sever the connection between Catholicism and imperialism. This sinister connection once seriously harmed our people's revolutionary cause, and the Chinese people still remember it vividly. What is introduced below are just a few examples of how imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang used Catholicism to undermine the people's revolutionary cause.

China's notorious war criminal, Archbishop of China Yu Bin, was a special agent chief cultivated by the American imperialist lackey Chiang Kai-shek. After Yu Bin graduated from the Roman Pontifical Urban University and returned to China, he relied on the power of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to serve as the bishop of the Nanjing Diocese and later climbed to the position of Archbishop of China. This loyal dog of imperialism became Chiang Kai-shek's accomplice in slaughtering the people as early as when the Chiang bandits were carrying out the ten-year anti-people civil war. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Yu Bin was appointed by the Chiang bandits as a pseudo-National Government senator, Chiang's political advisor, and pseudo-National Assembly representative because of his merits in opposing the people. During this period, Yu Bin assisted the Chiang bandits in developing special agent organizations throughout the country using the Catholic Church to carry out anti-people special agent activities.

During the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, there were also many heinous special agent elements who, under the guise of Catholicism, carried out anti-people special agent activities under the command of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Lebbe and Léont Van Peteghem were two very famous ones. Lebbe and Léont Van Peteghem were both Belgians who infiltrated China to preach before the Anti-Japanese War and often collected various important information about our country to supply to imperialism. Because they provided imperialism with a lot of important information, they were given the title of "China problem experts." In order to facilitate their special agent activities in China, they joined the Chinese nationality with the support of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, widely used Catholicism to establish special agent organizations, and developed counter-revolutionary armed forces with some Catholics as the backbone.

The Chiang bandit's "North China War Zone Supervision Group," which was active in North China in the early stage of the Anti-Japanese War, was formed by Lebbe. In the summer of 1938, Lebbe ran from North China to Wuhan and, through the introduction of war criminal Yu Bin, met with Chiang Kai-shek and special agent chief Dai Li. Chiang Kai-shek and Dai Li wanted to use Lebbe's influence in the North China Catholic Church to develop a special agent organization, so they first pulled Lebbe into the Military Intelligence Bureau's special agent organization and further allowed Lebbe to organize the "North China War Zone Supervision Group."

The "North China War Zone Supervision Group" was jointly formed by Military Intelligence Bureau special agents, Three People's Principles Youth League members, and Catholics. The group was divided into three detachments, nine companies, and twenty-seven platoons. They were distributed in Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and northern Henan provinces, cooperating with the Kuomintang bandit army, colluding with the Japanese and puppet troops, and carrying out anti-communist and anti-people special agent activities. After Lebbe's death, the group continued to be led by Catholic Li Guanghe (who served as the chief inspector of the Kuomintang National Defense Department's Confidential Bureau in North China during the Liberation War) and Bishop Micheal of the Xinxiang Diocese (an American special agent) to continue special agent activities.

The main tasks of the "North China War Zone Supervision Group" were to assist the Chiang bandit army and collude with the Japanese and puppet troops to establish special agent organizations and special agent armed forces in the liberated areas and occupied areas, collect various intelligence in the liberated areas, create rumors, and destroy various construction in the liberated areas. Lebbe personally led the second company of the first detachment of the group, living in the residence of Lu Zhonglin, chairman of the Chiang bandit Hebei Provincial Government (Hejiaping, Xingtai County), and used Lu bandit's radio station to send intelligence to Chiang's pseudo-regime. Sun Qizhi (Catholic), the captain of the third platoon of the second company, used preaching as a cover to lead the special agent work in Xingtai, Shahe, Yongnian, Handan and other places along the Pinghan Railway. He set up intelligence stations in local churches and used church members to collect intelligence. Through the introduction of Zheng Guodong, chairman of the Yongnian Magu Village Catholic Church, Sun Qizhi colluded with Xu Tieying, the head of the puppet army entrenched in the Yongnian area, and provided Xu bandit with intelligence. At the end of 1939, a part of the Kuomintang 97th Army (Zhu Huaibing) besieged the Shahe Anti-Japanese County Government at the Shahe Ferry, which was obtained from Sun Qizhi. Lebbe also ordered Catholic Li Zhongsan to organize a crusader army with Catholics as the backbone, with Li as the commander and Fan Zhendong (Catholic), a special agent of the Taiyuan Japanese Kempeitai, as the deputy commander, to carry out anti-people criminal activities. Liu Cheng, chief of the North China Supervision Group, was ordered by Lebbe to collude with Kimura (Japanese), a lieutenant general of the Japanese Army Liaison Department and a consultant of the Catholic Xishiku Cathedral in Beiping, in the Handan area to organize the special agent armed "Jinan Communist Suppression Army" mainly composed of Catholics.

After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, Léont Van Peteghem formed the "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" in North China. This was personally directed by Dai Li, the head of the Chiang bandit special agents. The "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" was an affiliated institution of the Chiang bandit's Confidential Bureau. In December 1945, Dai Li personally met Léont Van Peteghem in Beiping and instructed him on the "tactics" of establishing a special agent organization. After that, Léont Van Peteghem and Diaohuaren and other Confidential Bureau special agents and Catholics actively collected various intelligence about the Soviet Union and the liberated areas and supplied it to the Chiang bandit Confidential Bureau. In July of the same year, Dai Li sent the famous special agent Chen Zhenhua to assist Léont Van Peteghem in establishing a special agent organization, namely the "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps." The corps contacted the radio station of the bandit Confidential Bureau's Beijing Station and the headquarters of the bandit Confidential Bureau, and directly received special agent activity funds from the bandit Confidential Bureau. In order to facilitate special agent activities, the "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" successively established contacts with the Chiang bandit's Eleventh War Zone and the puppet Hebei Provincial Government. It also established two peripheral organizations, the "People's Self-Defense Corps" and the "People's National Construction Advancement Association," in an attempt to use the "People's Self-Defense Corps" to expand the special agent armed forces. At that time, they recruited deserters and vagrants from the Japanese and puppet security forces and some Catholics to form a counter-revolutionary armed force of three or four hundred people, led by Luo Yibin, and assigned to the bandit's Third Army. This counter-revolutionary armed force was completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army in the battle to liberate Shijiazhuang.

In July 1947, Léont Van Peteghem contacted a group of Catholics and successively established sub-groups of the Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps in various parts of North China to intensify counter-revolutionary activities such as collecting intelligence, instigating rebellion, and armed sabotage. The Hebei sub-group was headed by Diaohuaren concurrently, and Bi Zhuoyun was the secretary. Many work teams were also set up below the sub-group. Jin Yupei, the main criminal of the Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps and the People's National Construction Advancement Association and other special agent organizations recently uncovered in Tianjin, was the captain of the Tianjin work team of the Hebei sub-group at that time. In April and May 1948, Jin Yupei once organized reactionary landlords and bullies to cooperate with the Chiang bandit army to invade our Jizhong liberated area. A special agent armed force led by Jin Yupei wantonly killed and looted the people in the Renqiu area. After the liberation of Tianjin, Jin Yupei served as the captain of the "Pingjin District Team of the Underground Work Corps of the Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" and continued to carry out anti-communist and anti-people special agent activities.

On October 16, 1950, the Shijiazhuang City uncovered the "Catholic Patriotic Corps" special agent organization case. The main criminal, Wu Yage (priest of the Catholic Zhengding Diocese), joined the Kuomintang in 1946 and served as an executive member of the Kuomintang District Branch. In 1947, he joined the "Catholic Patriotic Corps" special agent organization. In August of the same year, after Wu bandit accepted the special agent mission in Beiping, he returned to Shijiazhuang and used the church to develop more than 70 special agents, who were active in 37 villages and towns in 16 counties and cities including Shijiazhuang, Pingshan, Lingshou, Zhengding, Wuji, and Gaocheng. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang in November 1947, the bandit lurked in the Zhengding Gaocheng area and secretly carried out activities to establish an intelligence organization. In January 1948, the bandit fled to Beiping and dispatched special agents to travel between Beiping and Shijiazhuang to spy on and transmit our military intelligence. Wu bandit drew a detailed map of the resident of the Pingshan County government and directed the bandit plane to bomb it, destroying 709 civilian houses and causing 34 deaths and injuries. The bandit also drew maps of the resident of our Shijiazhuang and other agencies, and reported them to the Chiang bandit special agent agency, stipulating that red and white bed sheets and arson should be used as signals to direct the planes to bomb. From September 13, 1948, the bandit planes continuously bombed Shijiazhuang and other places, causing 135 deaths and injuries in Shijiazhuang alone. Wu bandit also instructed Song Bendu to sneak into the liberated area to assassinate our military and government leaders.

Many special agent cases uncovered in various liberated areas under the cover of Catholicism, such as the espionage case in the Qiqihar Catholic Church and the espionage case in the Xianxian Catholic Church in Hebei, etc., made us more clearly recognize the true face of American imperialism and Chiang bandits using Catholicism to carry out special agent activities.

The espionage case in the Qiqihar Catholic Church was uncovered on July 24, 1947. According to the confession of the main criminal Hu Ganpu and the materials obtained by our public security organs, the Qiqihar Catholic Church had been carrying out special agent activities for a long time. In 1935, Hu organized the Qiqihar Chinese Catholic Youth Association and performed dramas promoting "the royal way paradise, Japanese-Manchu cooperation." In 1936, he published the "Fengsheng Monthly" to promote the Japanese invaders. In 1937, Hu received a certificate and bonus from Pu Yi. In May 1938, Hu dispatched the association's priests to speak at the anti-communist meeting convened by the Japanese invaders and distributed anti-communist leaflets. After the Japanese invaders surrendered in 1945, the Catholic Church colluded with Li Cier, a special agent of the Japanese invaders, to hide materials for the Japanese invaders Yin Teng and hid Hua Wendong, a famous bandit in Northeast China.

In 1946, Hu established a relationship with Peng Jiqun, chairman of the Kuomintang Nenjiang Province, and accepted the task of "helping the central government take over" given by Peng bandit. In April of the same year, Father Boshede purchased a radio station and secretly placed it in the Catholic Church. In August of the same year, Bo contacted Lieutenant Colonel Ballowf, the American representative of the military mediation team, and supplied Ballowf with various intelligence from the liberated area. The special agents also actively sabotaged the land reform, ordering church members not to participate in mass struggles, scolding farmers for distributing land as "tyrannical behavior," and spreading rumors such as "the central army must come in the autumn, and the Eighth Route Army will not be victorious." When the case was uncovered, a total of two radio stations, one small receiver, one large and one small transmitter, one hand-cranked motor, two plates of American-made detonators, and weapons and reactionary documents were seized.

The Hebei Xianxian Catholic international espionage case was uncovered on October 21, 1947. On the spot, one transmitter and one short-wave receiver, multiple American-made batteries, a copy of Sun Bandit Lianzhong's telegram "Xiang Zhi Character Three Two Two Character Han" to Zhao Zhensheng, the bishop of the church, and a notice issued on July 12, 1947 signed by the chief criminal Shang Jianxun (French) prohibiting church members from participating in land reform were found as evidence. These special agent bandits privately set up radio stations to supply intelligence to the US-Chiang, and organized church reactionary armed forces to collude with Chiang bandits to invade the liberated area. On January 4, 1947, the chief criminal Shang Jianxun and others sent Liao Yeer secretly to Beiping to request Sun Lianzhong, commander of the Chiang bandit's Eleventh War Zone, to send troops to invade our Jizhong liberated area. Sun Lianzhong replied on the 14th, saying: "Troops have been dispatched to suppress them." These special agents actively sabotaged the liberated area people's participation in the army and support for the front line and other actions. For example, inciting soldiers to desert, prohibiting church members from carrying stretchers, organizing young people to flee to the Chiang-occupied area, and ordering church members to steal confidential documents, etc. When the Liberation Army took the initiative to withdraw from Yan'an in 1947, they held a grand mass to pray for the "victory" of the Chiang bandits.

At present, patriotic people in Catholic churches in many regions have launched or are launching self-reliance and reform movements, proposing to expose the special agent elements hidden in Catholicism, which is very correct. Thoroughly clearing the counter-revolutionary elements in Catholicism will put the Chinese Catholic Church on the road to sound development. If these special agent elements in religious clothing are still obsessed with their mistakes, they will surely be overwhelmed by the increasingly surging patriotic wave across the country.

　　某些天主教的败类是怎样破坏人民革命事业的
    朱波
    全国若干地区的爱国的天主教人士，正在开展革新运动和爱国运动，这是非常必要的。革新运动的主要内容之一，是斩断天主教与帝国主义的连系。这种罪恶的联系，曾经严重地危害过我国人民的革命事业，中国人民至今记忆犹新。下面介绍的，只是帝国主义及蒋介石匪帮利用天主教，破坏人民革命事业的几个例子。
    中国著名的战犯、中华总主教于斌，就是美帝国主义走狗蒋介石一手培植起来的特务头子。于斌在罗马叶俄略大学毕业归国后，借美帝国主义及蒋介石匪帮的势力，担任了南京教区的主教，后来更爬上中华总主教的地位。这个帝国主义的忠实走狗，早在蒋匪进行十年反人民内战的时候，就成了蒋介石屠杀人民的帮凶。抗日战争爆发以后，于匪由于反人民有功，即被蒋匪任为伪国民政府参政员，蒋匪政治顾问及伪国大代表。在这一时期，于匪曾协助蒋匪，在全国各地利用天主教会发展特务组织，进行反人民的特务活动。
    在抗日战争及解放战争中，还有许多罪大恶极的特务分子，披着天主教的外衣，在帝国主义及蒋介石匪帮指挥下，进行反人民的特务活动。雷鸣远和雷震远就是其中非常著名的两个。雷鸣远和雷震远都是比利时人，在抗日战争以前，即潜入中国传教，经常搜集我国各种重要的情况，供给帝国主义。由于他们给帝国主义供给了许多重要的情报，因此，获得“中国问题专家”的称号。他们为了便于在中国进行特务活动，曾在蒋匪帮支持下，加入中国籍，广泛地利用天主教，建立特务组织，并以某些天主教徒为骨干，发展反革命武装。
    抗日战争初期活动在华北地区的蒋匪“华北战地督导团”，是雷鸣远一手组成的。在一九三八年夏天，雷鸣远从华北跑到武汉，经战犯于斌介绍，会见蒋介石及特务头子戴笠。蒋介石和戴笠想借雷鸣远在华北天主教中的影响，发展特务组织，于是首先把雷匪拉入军统特务组织，进一步让雷匪组织“华北战地督导团”。
    “华北战地督导团”是军统特务、三青团员、天主教徒联合组成的。该团下设三个大队，九个中队，二十七个区队。分布在河北、山西、陕西、及河南省北部一带，配合国民党匪军，勾结日伪军，进行反共反人民的特务活动。雷鸣远死后，该团续由天主教徒李广和（解放战争期间曾任蒋匪国防部保密局华北区总督察）及新乡教区主教米甘（美籍特务）领导，继续进行特务活动。
    “华北战地督导团”主要任务是：协助蒋匪军、勾结日伪军在解放区和沦陷区建立特务组织及特务武装，搜集解放区内各种情报，制造谣言，破坏解放区内各种建设。雷鸣远曾亲自带领该团第一大队二中队，住在蒋匪河北省府主席鹿钟麟的驻地（邢台县河家坪），利用鹿匪的电台，向蒋伪拍发情报。二中队三区队队长孙启之（天主教徒），以传教为掩护，领导平汉线邢台、沙河、永年、邯郸等地的特务工作。他在各地教堂内设立情报站，利用教徒搜集情报。孙启之经过永年马固村天主教会会长郑国栋的介绍，和盘踞永年一带的伪军头子许铁英勾结，供给许匪情报。一九三九年底国民党九十七军（朱怀冰）一部在沙河渡口围攻沙河抗日县政府，即是从孙启之处取得情报的。雷鸣远并曾命令天主教徒李仲三组织以天主教徒为骨干的十字军，以李为司令，以太原日本宪兵队特务范振东（天主教徒）为副司令，进行反人民的罪恶活动。华北督导团科长刘诚奉雷鸣远之命，在邯郸一带句结日本陆军联络部中将、天主教北平西什库总堂顾问木村（日籍），组织了以天主教徒为主的特务武装“冀南剿共军”。
    日寇投降后，雷震远在华北组成“公教青年报国团”。这是蒋匪特务头子戴笠亲自指挥的。“公教青年报国团”是蒋匪保密局的一个隶属机构。一九四五年十二月，戴笠在北平亲自召见雷震远，指示建立特务组织的“机宜”。此后雷震远和保密局特务、天主教徒刁化仁等即积极活动，搜集苏联及解放区的各种情报，供给蒋匪保密局。同年七月间，戴笠派来著名特务陈镇华，协助雷震远等建立特务组织。即“公教青年报国团”。该团以匪保密局北京站的电台和匪保密局本部联络，并直接从匪保密局领取特务活动经费。“公教青年报国团”为了便于进行特务活动，先后和蒋匪十一战区及伪河北省政府建立联系。并成立了“民众自卫总团”和“民众建国协进会”两个外围组织。企图利用“民众自卫总团”扩充特务武装。当时，他们曾收容日伪治安军的散兵游勇及一部分天主教徒，组成一支三、四百人的反革命武装，由骆毅宾率领，配属于匪第三军行动。这一支反革命武装在解放石家庄战斗中，全部为人民解放军歼灭。
    一九四七年七月间，雷震远又联络了一部分天主教徒，先后在华北各地建立公教青年报国团分团，加紧进行搜集情报、策反及武装破坏等反革命活动。河北分团以刁化仁兼主任，毕卓云任书记。在分团以下，还设立了许多工作队。最近天津市破获的公教青年报国团、民众建国协进会等特务组织的主犯金玉培，就是当时河北分团天津工作队队长。一九四八年四、五月间，金玉培曾经组织反动地主恶霸，配合蒋匪军进犯我冀中解放区，金玉培所带领的一股特务武装，曾大肆杀戮、抢劫任邱一带的人民。天津解放后，金玉培充任“公教青年报国团地下工作总队平津区队”队长，继续进行反共反人民的特务活动。
    一九五○年十月十六日，石家庄市破获了“公教报国团”特务组织案，主犯吴雅阁（天主教正定教区神甫）于一九四六年参加国民党，曾任国民党区分部执行委员。一九四七年参加“公教报国团”特务组织。同年八月，吴匪在北平接受特务任务后，返回石家庄，利用教会发展了七十余名特务，分别在石家庄、平山、灵寿、正定、无极、藁城等十六个县市、三十七个村庄活动。一九四七年十一月石家庄解放后，该匪即潜伏在正定藁城一带秘密活动，建立谍报组织。一九四八年一月，该匪逃往北平，派遣特务来往北平、石家庄间，刺探和传递我方军事情报。吴匪曾绘制平山县机关驻地详图，指挥匪机轰炸，计炸毁民房七百零九间，死伤三十四人。该匪又绘制我石家庄等地机关驻地图，转报蒋匪特务机关，规定以红白被单及放火为号，指使飞机轰炸。从一九四八年九月十三日起，匪机连续轰炸石家庄等地，仅石市即死伤一百三十五人。吴匪并指使宋本笃潜入解放区，谋杀我军政首长。
    解放区各地破获的许多以天主教为掩护的特务案，如齐齐哈尔天主教内的间谍案、河北献县天主教内的间谍案等，使我们更清楚地认识了美帝国主义及蒋匪利用天主教进行特务活动的真面目。
    齐齐哈尔天主教内的间谍案，是一九四七年七月二十四日破获的。据该案主犯胡干普的口供及我公安机关所获材料，齐市天主教堂很早就进行特务活动。一九三五年胡犯曾组织齐市中华公教青年会，演出宣扬“皇道乐土，日满协和”的戏剧。一九三六年出版《锋声月刊》，为日寇作宣传。一九三七年，胡犯获得了溥仪的奖状和奖金。一九三八年五月，胡犯派遣该会神甫到日寇召集的反共会上讲演，散发反共传单。一九四五年日寇投降后，该天主堂曾与日寇特务李次二勾结，为日寇尹藤隐藏物资，并藏匿东北著名的土匪华文东。
    一九四六年，胡犯与国民党嫩江省主席彭济群接上关系，接受彭匪给予的“帮助中央接收”的任务。同年四月，由神甫博施德购置电台，秘置天主堂内。同年八月，博犯与军调部执行小组美国代表巴劳夫中校取得联系，向巴劳夫供给解放区的各种情报。特务们并积极破坏土地改革，命令教徒不准参加群众斗争，谩骂农民分配土地为“暴虐行为”，散布“中央军秋天一定要来，八路军胜利不了”等谣言。破获此案时，计搜出电台两部，小型收报机一部，大小型发报机各一部，手摇马达一部，美制雷管两盘，及武器、反动文件等证物。
    河北献县天主教国际间谍案于一九四七年十月二十一日破获。当场搜出发报机及短波收报机各一部，美制电池多件，孙匪连仲复该堂主教赵振声的“相智字三二二字之寒”代电一份，及一九四七年七月十二日首犯尚建勋（法籍）签名发出的禁止教民参加土地改革的通知等罪证。这些特务匪徒私设电台，供给美蒋情报，并组织教会反动武装，勾结蒋匪进犯解放区。一九四七年一月四日，主犯尚建勋等曾派遣廖迓迩秘密赴北平，要求蒋匪十一战区司令长官孙连仲派兵进犯我冀中解放区。孙连仲于十四日复文说：“已酌派部队前往进剿。”这些特务对解放区人民参军，支援前线等行动，积极进行破坏。如煽动战士逃亡，禁止教民抬担架，组织青壮年逃亡蒋占区，并令教民偷窃秘密文件等。一九四七年解放军主动撤离延安时，他们曾作了一台大弥撒，为蒋匪的“胜利”祈祷。
    目前，许多地区天主教会中的爱国人士，已经或正在掀起自立革新运动，提出检举隐藏在天主教中的特务分子，这是非常正确的。彻底清除了天主教内的反革命分子，将使中国天主教走上健全发展的道路。如果这些披着宗教外衣的特务分子仍然执迷不悟，就一定会在全国日益澎湃的爱国浪潮中灭顶。
