　　The spring dredging project of the Sui River in the Suxian area of Northern Anhui Province has fully commenced. The river is a major tributary of the Huai River, stretching 133 kilometers from Suixikou in the upper reaches to Linhuaitou on the edge of Hongze Lake in the lower reaches. The planned dredging volume is 18,400,162 cubic meters of earthwork, 823,000 cubic meters of earth for dike construction, and 5,000,000 cubic meters for upstream management, totaling 24,224,662 cubic meters. Last winter, over 226,000 civil laborers were mobilized, completing 4,133,216 cubic meters in twenty days. Among them, 50,000 civil laborers from Sixian County started work on December 20th last year, overcoming severe cold of minus 10 degrees Celsius, snow, rain, and the Lunar New Year, and have not stopped working. Lingbi County and Suxian County stopped work during the freezing weather on January 10th, but on January 25th, after the weather warmed up, more than 25,000 civil laborers along the river resumed work. Now the spring project is fully underway, and from February 11th to the 20th, the number of civil laborers at work has reached 245,000. 40,000 civil laborers working on the 50-kilometer stretch of the old river management project upstream from Suixi to Fulidian are also starting work one after another. The Five River’s 10,000-strong expeditionary labor force also arrived at the Sixian County section around the 10th of this month. The spring project of the Sui River still has more than 20,090,000 cubic meters of earthwork remaining. The most difficult part is the 60-kilometer drainage project from Huitanggou to Kuhetou, especially the newly opened 25-kilometer river channel drainage work in Lingbi is extremely arduous. The sand and gravel excavation project in the 80-kilometer section from Chantangji in Lingbi to Shiji in Sihong is also very difficult, especially the more than 10-kilometer stretch of sand and gravel layer from Shipu to Kuhetou in Sixian County. However, the morale of the civil laborers is high, and all these difficulties are being overcome one by one.

　　皖北宿县专区二十四万余民工上堤
    濉河春季疏浚工程全面开工
    皖北宿县专区濉河春季疏浚工程全面开工。该河是淮河一大支流，上至濉溪口下至洪泽湖边临淮头，全长一百三十三公里，计划疏浚土方为一千八百四十万零一千六百六十二公方，取土筑堤八十二万三千公方，上游整理工程五百万公方，共计是二千四百二十二万四千六百六十二公方。去年冬季即动员二十二万六千余民工，二十天时间完成了四百十三万三千二百十六公方。其中泗县五万民工从去年十二月二十号开工，克服了摄氏零下十度的严寒与雪雨年关，一直没有停工。灵璧县和宿县在一月十号冰天雪地时放工，二十五号天气转暖后，沿河民工复工的即有二万五千余人。现春季工程全面展开，从二月十一日起到二十日止，上工民工已达二十四万五千人。濉溪至符离段上游五十公里整理旧河工程四万民工，亦陆续上工，五河万余远征劳动大军亦于本月十日前后开抵泗县工段。濉河春季工程，尚有二千零九万余公方，最艰难的是浍塘沟以下至枯河头六十公里排水工程，尤其是灵璧二十五公里新开河道排水工作异常艰巨。从灵璧禅堂集到泗洪石集约八十公里工段挖砂礓工程亦很艰难，特别是泗县时铺到枯河头十余公里的砂礓层更严重。但民工情绪高涨，所有这些困难都正被一一克服着。
