　　Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: The United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee held a tea party on the 4th to host all members of the three land reform visiting groups (East China, Central South, and Northwest regions) organized by professors from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Normal University, Yenching University, and other schools, who had returned to Beijing. Professors Wu Jingchao, Zheng Tianting, Lou Bangyan, Zhu Guangqian, Bian Zhilin, and others from various universities attended and spoke enthusiastically. From their personal experience in land reform, they believed that participating in land reform was of great benefit to the ideological remolding of intellectuals. They hoped to be able to participate in the land reform work teams in the new areas after the autumn harvest this year. The professors reported at the meeting that the emancipated peasants in various places urgently needed to learn culture, science, and hygiene knowledge, and hoped that scientific, medical, and artistic workers could go to the countryside to work.
