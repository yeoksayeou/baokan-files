How the Tangshan Railway South Factory Trade Union Faces Production
    Quán Zōng

　　The Tangshan Railway South Factory Trade Union has achieved great success in facing production over the past year. After launching the innovation record movement in March 1950, it initiated the "Red May" production competition. Currently, it is carrying out a patriotic production campaign to resist American aggression and aid Korea. Last year, the entire factory achieved the feat of completing half a year's production tasks in five months, with some workshops completing the entire year's production tasks in seven months. The entire factory saved over nine million catties of millet, and two hundred and thirty labor models and ten model groups emerged. A total of five thousand six hundred and nineteen employees received awards.

　　At the end of 1949, the factory underwent democratic reform, and on this basis, the grassroots trade union organizations were formally elected and established. Because the trade union leadership paid attention to promoting democracy and mobilized and relied on the workers, the workers realized that the trade union was truly their own organization, and 96 percent of them automatically paid their membership dues on time. Under these circumstances, the Tangshan Railway South Factory began to embark on the road of facing production.

　　The most important experience of the Tangshan Railway South Factory in facing production is to promote production work through workshop meetings. Every day, the entire factory has one hour of study before starting work. This system was originally stipulated by the administration, but later it was taken over and implemented by the trade union. The content of the study is: conveying and arranging and discussing the work plan for each period, the central tasks, instructions from higher authorities, work summaries, as well as current affairs studies, trade union business, etc. The method of study is to conduct large-scale transmission and explanation or group discussions in workshops, according to the nature of the problem. With this kind of study, all workers can grasp the work plan, and they can also understand various issues in trade union business and instructions from higher authorities, which has a great role in promoting trade union work. When discussing and formulating the collective contract, this study time was used to explain it in workshop meetings, conduct group discussions, and finally make a resolution. In this way, every worker has a deep understanding of the collective contract. This study has now become a workshop meeting for employees to study production tasks and trade union work.

　　The trade union leads all workers to master the production plan. After the administration distributes the standard plan of the workshop to each group, the trade union leads each group to formulate group and individual plans based on the standard plan. This plan is called the pre-ordered plan. When the Wú Kāiyún group of the passenger car shop set the pre-ordered plan, it created the "Daily Work Chart System." This system was quickly promoted throughout the factory. The "Daily Work Chart System" is that the group first studies how much labor is required for each item of work, the quality of each item, and the daily progress based on the administrative standard plan. Then, the group divides the work within the group through self-reporting and public discussion. After the division of labor, everyone forms three-person mutual aid groups according to their labor strength, technical level, and the quality and quantity of tools. Finally, the progress and quality of each person's daily work are all listed on the blackboard in a chart. In this way, a regular production competition naturally unfolds between groups and between people. In the competition, the three-person mutual aid group played a great role in improving technology. Those with high skills help and guide those with low skills at any time. Workers who fail to complete the daily chart plan conduct a review in the group meeting or during the lunch break to find out the reasons for not completing the task and formulate ways to complete the task. The experience of those who exceed the chart plan can also be disseminated in a timely manner. Obstacles in production can also be overcome at any time. When Wú Hǎiyún's group was making eighty-eight pillars for car No. 4003, the work was delayed due to waiting for the drill. The group then studied and adopted the assembly line method. The person in charge of the number specializes in the number; the person in charge of drilling specializes in drilling; the person in charge of screwing specializes in screwing. This overcame the difficulty of delaying work due to waiting for the drill, and the work originally scheduled for ten workers was completed by five workers. When the production plan is truly mastered by the workers, the creativity and production enthusiasm of the masses are greatly improved. Wú Hǎiyún's group alone created new records in shortening working hours as many as eight times, and received awards.

　　In order to do a better job in production, the trade union should care about and help workers solve their difficulties in life. Sūn Liánwàng of the foundry shop used to be a worker who was neither active nor backward, just following the crowd. He was neither distant nor close to the trade union. Once, he was injured in the head and was recuperating at home. The trade union visited him several times with things and gave him all kinds of care, urging him to take good care of his injury. He was moved to tears and said, "In the past, even if I was killed, no one would care about me. For so many years, I have lived alone, without relatives, and I am afraid of getting sick and no one taking care of me. Now the trade union cares about me so much, it is my relative." After the injury was healed, he became very kind to the trade union, actively responded to the call of the trade union, obeyed the leadership of the trade union, and his production enthusiasm was greatly improved. In last year's "Red May" competition, he modified the copper melting furnace and achieved great results, and was selected as a special model in Tangshan City. In addition to timely care for injured and sick employees, the trade union also organized the masses to help each other solve difficulties. Mutual aid associations were organized in each workshop. In the mutual aid association of 124 people in the passenger car shop, the family difficulties of more than 60 people have been solved in the past three months.

　　The relationship between the trade union and the administration is also relatively normal. Whenever it comes to production or the welfare of the workers, the trade union truly represents the opinions of the workers and adheres to principles. For example, in the past, when the task was not completed, the administration would let the workers work overtime. In August last year, the administration consulted with the trade union again, asking the locomotive shop to work eight hours of overtime every day. The trade union insisted on handling matters in accordance with the Trade Union Law and did not agree to overtime. At that time, the administration believed that it had the power and authority to ask workers to work overtime, and the trade union should not interfere. Seeing that the dispute was ineffective, the trade union wrote to the newspaper of the Ministry of Railways, stating the situation of overtime and the differences of opinion with the administration. Soon, the newspaper criticized this overtime as bad and stated that the trade union's criticism was correct. After such a dispute, from then on, whenever there was overtime, the administration took the initiative to consult with the trade union and seek the consent of both parties. Since the prohibition of random overtime, the number of sick people has been greatly reduced, and production has been relatively improved. During the overtime in August, an average of more than 400 people saw a doctor every day, but by November (no overtime), the number of people who saw a doctor was reduced by half, and locomotive production increased by 0.4 percent compared to August, passenger car production increased by 2.4 percent, and freight car production increased by 66 percent. This shows that only by adhering to principles can the trade union truly give play to the enthusiasm of the workers and do a good job in production. Only in this way can the relationship between the trade union and the administration be truly united.

　　唐山铁路南厂工会如何面向生产
    权宗
    唐山铁路南厂工会一年来在面向生产上获得了很大的成绩。一九五○年三月展开了创新纪录运动以后，又掀起了红五月的生产竞赛。现在正开展着抗美援朝爱国主义生产运动。去年全厂已创造出五个月完成半年生产任务的成绩，有的车间七个月完成了全年的生产任务。全厂节省了小米九百余万斤，出现了二百三十名劳动模范，十个典型小组。职工得奖者达五千六百十九人。
    一九四九年底该厂进行民主改革，在这一基础上该厂工会基层组织正式选举成立。由于工会领导上注意发扬民主，发动和依靠了工人群众，使工人体会到工会真正是自己的组织，按期自动缴纳会费的达百分之九十六。在这样的情况下，唐山铁路南厂开始走上面向生产的道路。
    唐山铁路南厂面向生产最重要的经验，是通过车间大会推动生产工作。全厂每天早晨在开工前，有一小时的学习。这一制度原为行政上所规定，后由工会掌握执行。学习内容是：传达布置和讨论每时期的工作计划、中心任务、上级指示、工作总结以及时事学习、工会业务等。学习方法是，根据问题性质，以车间为单位进行大会传达讲解或分组讨论。有了这样的学习，全体工人就能够掌握工作计划，对工会业务、上级指示中的各种问题也能有所认识，对工会工作有很大推动作用。讨论订立集体合同时就是利用这一学习时间，在车间大会上进行讲解，分组讨论，最后作出了决议。这样，每个工人对集体合同都有了深刻的了解。这种学习目前已成为职工群众研究生产任务和工会工作的车间大会。
    工会领导全体工人掌握生产计划。行政上将车间的标准计划发到各个小组后，工会就领导各组根据标准计划制定组内和个人计划。这个计划叫做预订计划。客车场吴开云小组在定预订计划时作出了“逐日工作图表制”。这种制度很快地推广到全场。“逐日工作图表制”是组内根据行政上的标准计划，先研究出每项每件工作须要多少工完成、每件的质量及每天的进度，然后小组内以自报公议的办法进行分工。分工后大家再按劳力的强弱，技术的高低，工具的好坏和多寡，分别组成三人互助组。最后把每人每日的进度和质量，统统以图表列到黑板上。这样，组与组、人与人之间便自然地展开了经常性的生产竞赛。竞赛中，三人互助组在改进技术上起了很大作用。技术高的随时帮助和指导技术低的。完不成逐日图表计划的工人，在小组会议上或在午饭休息时间进行检讨，找出完不成任务的原因，订出完成任务的办法。超过图表计划者的经验，也能及时得到传播。生产中的阻碍也能随时得到克服。吴海云小组在作四○○三车的八十八根立柱时，因等钻误工，组内便研究采用流水作业法。号眼的专管号眼；钻眼的专管钻眼；上螺丝的专管上螺丝。这样就克服了等钻误工的困难，原订十个工的工作五个工就完成了。生产计划真正为工人所掌握时，群众的创造力和生产情绪就大为提高。仅吴海云一组在缩短工时上创造新纪录即达八次之多，而且受到了奖励。
    为了把生产工作做得更好，工会应关心并帮助工人解决生活中的困难。铸工场孙连旺过去是个既不积极也不落后跟随大流跑的工人，他对工会也不疏远也不接近。有一次他的头被砸伤了在家养伤，工会几次带着东西去看他，多方给予照顾，劝他好好养伤。他感动得流着泪说：“在过去就是砸死，谁管你呢？多少年来我一个人过日子，没有亲人，就怕得病没人管。现在工会这样关心我，就是我的亲人。”伤好后，他对工会变得非常亲切，积极响应工会的号召，服从工会的领导，生产情绪大为提高。去年红五月竞赛中，他改修了化铜炉得到很大成绩，被选为唐山市的特等模范。工会除及时照顾伤病职工外，并组织了群众互助解决困难。各车间都组织了工友互助会。客车一百二十四人参加的互助会中，三个月来就已解决了六十余人的家庭困难。
    工会和行政的关系也比较正常。凡是有关生产、有关工人群众的福利，工会真正代表工人意见，坚持原则。如过去完不成任务时，行政就让工人加班，在去年八月份行政又与工会商量，让机车场每天加八小时的班，工会则坚持按工会法办事，不同意加班，当时行政上认为自己有职有权可以叫工人加班，工会不应阻拦。工会见争论无效，便将加班的情况与行政的分歧意见，写到铁道部机关报社去，不久报上批评这种加班是不好的，并说明工会批评得对。经过这样争论后，自此凡遇加班事情，行政上都是主动与工会协商，求得双方同意。自禁止了随便加班后，病号大为减少，生产相对提高了。八月份加班时看病的每日平均有四百余人，到十一月份（不加班）看病的减少了一半，而且比八月份机车生产提高了百分之零点四，客车提高百分之二点四，货车提高了百分之六六。这说明工会只有坚持原则，才能真正发挥工人群众积极性搞好生产，也只有这样，工会和行政的关系才能真正团结一致。
