    Enhance Political Vigilance
    Block all loopholes, leaving no room for spies and bandits
    Letter from Liu Dapeng of the Jilin People's Government Public Security Department

    Recently, the People's Daily has prominently published many reports on the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities. As readers of the People's Daily, we pay close attention to these reports. Cases like the spy arson case in Lingling County, Hunan Province, the execution of a group of counter-revolutionary criminals by the Beijing and Tianjin People's Public Security Organs, and especially the cracking of the American "Army Strategic Intelligence Office" spy organization in Tianjin, made me feel extremely happy after reading them. I firmly support this severe suppression of counter-revolutionary elements.

    In order to correctly implement the "Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," to seek justice and revenge for the countless victims, to safeguard the fruits of our people's victory, to protect the safety of our people's lives and property, and to protect the smooth progress of the country's production and construction, the severe suppression of counter-revolutionary elements is extremely necessary and correct; otherwise, our production and construction... everything would be unimaginable.

    The cracking of the American spy case in Tianjin once again nakedly exposes that the American and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents are one family. They collude with each other and jointly engage in despicable and shameless activities of murder and arson. We can never forget the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization," which was a murderous den where American imperialism cultivated and trained special agent claws for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. It is ironclad proof of American imperialism's persecution of the Chinese people. Now that American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, have been driven out of mainland China by our people, they are still not reconciled. They are trying every possible means to use a large number of spies and special agents to continue to carry out assassinations, sabotage, intelligence gathering, and sowing discord in the new China. Is there any doubt about this?

    Therefore, we must further enhance our political vigilance, block all loopholes, and leave no room for special agents and bandits. As long as all the Chinese people form a giant people's net and assist the People's Government Public Security Organs in reporting and exposing all counter-revolutionary elements, we will be able to completely smash any conspiracy or plan of the imperialists and their running dog reactionaries against the Chinese people. Let us study the "Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries" well and be seriously vigilant. We believe that no spy, special agent, or counter-revolutionary element can escape the net of the people's law and the punishment of the people.

    提高政治警惕性
    堵住一切漏洞，使特务匪徒无缝可钻
    吉林人民政府公安厅刘大鹏来信
    最近一个时期，人民日报曾经大张旗鼓地发表了很多镇压反革命活动的消息。我们是人民日报的读者，非常注意关心这些消息。像湖南省零陵县判处的特务纵火案、北京、天津人民公安机关处决的一批反革命罪犯案、特别是天津破获的美国“陆军战略情报处”的间谍特务组织案，我看完心里真痛快极啦，对于反革命分子这种严厉的镇压，我表示坚决拥护。
    为了正确地贯彻执行《惩治反革命条例》，为了给那些无数被害的人民伸冤报仇，为了保卫我们人民的胜利果实，为了保护我们人民生命财产的安全，为了保卫祖国顺利进行生产建设事业，对反革命分子的严厉镇压，这是十分需要和十分正确的；否则，我们的生产建设……一切的一切都是不堪设想的。
    从天津破获之美国间谍案，又一次赤裸裸地暴露了美蒋特务是一家。它们狼狈为奸，共同干着杀人放火的卑鄙无耻勾当。我们永远也不能忘掉“中美特种技术合作所”，就是美帝国主义为蒋家匪帮培养、训练特务爪牙的杀人魔窟。它就是美帝国主义残害中国人民的铁证。现在，美帝国主义及其走狗蒋家匪帮被我国人民逐出中国大陆以后，仍不死心，它们正想尽一切办法，利用大批的间谍、特务，想着在新中国继续进行暗杀，破坏，搜集情报，挑拨离间等活动，这难道还有疑问吗？
    因此我们要更加提高政治警觉性，堵住一切漏洞，使特务匪徒无空子可钻。只要我们全中国人民，组成一张人民的巨网，协助人民政府公安机关检举、揭发一切反革命分子，我们就能够把帝国主义者及其走狗反动派的任何一项反对中国人民的阴谋计划都彻底粉碎。愿我们好好的学习“惩治反革命条例”，认真的警惕起来，我们相信，一切间谍、特务反革命分子是绝逃脱不掉人民的法网和人民的惩办的。
