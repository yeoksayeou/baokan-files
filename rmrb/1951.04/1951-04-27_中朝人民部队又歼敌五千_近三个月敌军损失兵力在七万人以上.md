　　Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 26th: Our front-line reporter reports: In operations from the 11th to the 21st of this month, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army annihilated over 5,000 enemy troops, the vast majority of whom were American aggressor troops, about 4,500. Thus, since the enemy launched its adventurous northward offensive on January 25th of this year, the enemy forces have lost more than 70,000 troops in nearly three months. In launching this adventurous northward offensive, the American aggressors boasted of using mobile warfare tactics to "consume" and "kill" our army. However, in nearly three months of resistance, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have not only not been consumed and weakened, but their hatred for the enemy has deepened and their fighting spirit has become even more high-spirited. It is the American aggressor troops themselves who are being consumed and killed. The fate of the American aggression against Korea is doomed. Since MacArthur has been forced to step down after suffering repeated defeats, what new tactics can Ridgway come up with to save the doomed situation?

　　中朝人民部队又歼敌五千
　  近三个月敌军损失兵力在七万人以上
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】本社前线记者报道：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在本月十一日至二十一日的作战中又歼灭了敌军五千人以上，其中绝大多数为美国侵略军，约占四千五百名。至此，敌军从本年一月二十五日发动向北冒险进攻以来，在将近三个月中，损失的兵力已在七万人以上。美国侵略者在发动这次向北的冒险进攻中，曾吹嘘所谓以运动战“消耗”和“杀伤”我军的战法。但是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在近三个月的抗击战中，不但没有被消耗和削弱，而且对敌军仇恨更深，战志更加昂扬。被消耗、被杀伤的倒是美国侵略军自己。美国侵朝战略失败的命运是注定了的，麦克阿瑟既然因为连吃败仗滚下台去了，那末李奇微又能想出什么新的战法来挽救失败的定局呢？
