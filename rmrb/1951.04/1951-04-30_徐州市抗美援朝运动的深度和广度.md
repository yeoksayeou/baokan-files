    The Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement in Xuzhou City can be roughly divided into three stages. The first stage, from the joint declaration issued by the democratic parties on November 4th last year to the establishment of the Xuzhou City Branch of the People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression on December 2nd. This stage mainly involved carrying out current affairs study and propaganda inside and outside the Party, clarifying the confused thinking of cadres and the masses arising from the new situation of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea and Home-Defense Movement; the second stage, from the establishment of the Xuzhou City Branch of the People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression to the Xuzhou City People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Representative Conference on February 25th this year. The main characteristic of this stage was unified leadership, the comprehensive launch of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea and Home-Defense Movement, and the implementation of this patriotic movement's enthusiasm into practical work. Each unit universally formulated patriotic pledges or action programs; the third stage, from the convening of the Xuzhou City People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Representative Conference to the present, this stage is characterized mainly by seeking the consolidation and development of the movement, universally and deeply.

    The scale of this Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement in Xuzhou City exceeds any previous mass movement. According to incomplete statistics, the number of representatives participating in the separately held workers' representative conferences, student representative conferences, government employee representative conferences, Communist Youth League representative conferences, Sino-Soviet Friendship Association member representative conferences, and the city-wide Anti-American and Aid-Korea representative conference totaled approximately three thousand. These representatives are all activists among the masses. Educating the masses and expanding influence through them makes the number difficult to calculate. The denunciation meetings held separately by various sectors totaled two times, once denouncing the crimes of American imperialist aggression and once denouncing the crimes of the Japanese bandits. The number of participants totaled more than 50,000 people. Recently, a radio denunciation meeting was held, with more than 100,000 people organized to listen. Its impact extended not only to the masses of this city, but also to Tongshan, Tongbei, Xiao County, and Shan County around this city. Shan County alone organized more than 4,000 people to listen through its radio station. The anti-American patriotic demonstrations held separately by workers, students, women, industry and commerce, religious circles, and performing arts circles involved approximately 60,000 people. The most recent city-wide people's demonstration against American imperialism's rearmament of Japan exceeded any previous one. The number of people participating in the demonstration was approximately 100,000, and the number of people standing on the streets on both sides of the marching ranks to cheer reached more than 100,000. In summary, the masses who have been educated in Anti-American and Aid-Korea and participated in this movement total more than 200,000, accounting for more than two-thirds of the city's total population.

    This movement also has a relatively broad scope, including workers, peasants, students, industry and commerce, women, medical, cultural circles, and even religious circles, which had deeper connections with imperialism, have also joined the ranks of this movement, actively engaging in various activities. In the past, elderly people in their eighties and nineties who never cared about politics automatically organized an elderly team of more than 40 people to participate in the demonstration against American imperialism's rearmament of Japan. The team was well-organized, constantly shouting slogans along the way, and persevered until the end of the demonstration. These are all phenomena that have not been seen in the past.

    In terms of the depth of this movement, it not only swept away pro-American, admiration for America, and fear of America sentiments, and established national self-esteem and self-confidence, but also implemented the enthusiasm for Anti-American and Aid-Korea and Home-Defense into action, transforming it into actual strength. For example, the worker masses of the city's 16 major factories and mines launched a patriotic production competition, with 187 production teams challenging the Ma Hengchang team. The production enthusiasm of the working class is high, and great achievements have been created in production. The average daily coal production per person at the Jiawang Coal Mine reached 0.542 tons in January this year, an increase of 86 percent compared to October last year. After railway workers automatically held a signing and declaration to eliminate accidents, the No. 1909 locomotive crew has successfully completed 100,000 kilometers of safe driving and is now working hard to complete 200,000 kilometers without accidents. In general areas (excluding disaster areas), the peasant masses have successfully completed the task of ending land reform and, under the slogan of "Anti-American and Aid-Korea, guard the gate," "defend the fruits of liberation," expanded the militia. According to statistics from the first district of Tongshan County, the militia in the entire district has expanded from 222 to 484 people. After the peasants divided the land, they actively prepared for the spring farming and production. One village in Yanshan Township increased its livestock by more than 100 heads this year. The most prominent manifestation of students in the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement is that they responded to the call of the motherland and launched a wave of registration to participate in military cadre schools. There were a total of more than 2,500 registrants in the two times, accounting for about 50 percent of the total number of students. More than 5,000 teachers and students in the city made more than 12,000 comfort bags and wrote more than 8,000 comfort letters. According to statistics from elementary schools alone, nearly 100 street propaganda campaigns were held, with approximately 50,000 viewers. During the winter vacation, elementary schools also organized land reform propaganda teams to go deep into the countryside to promote propaganda. The area included 35 townships and more than 70 villages, with a total of 62 dramas, 66 variety shows, 90 comic strip exhibitions, 73 speeches, and 75 magic lantern shows, with a total audience of more than 50,000 people. The industry and commerce sectors first formulated five patriotic pledges as their action program. Each industry has also formulated business pledges based on its specific circumstances. Currently, 34 industries have formulated their own business pledges. In order to practice the pledges and ensure the completion of tax payment tasks, the industry and commerce sectors launched collective tax payment. Currently, six industries have paid taxes collectively in advance, eliminating past illegal phenomena such as tax evasion, tax avoidance, delay, and postponement. In the donation movement, the industry and commerce sectors donated an ambulance at the victory celebration meeting for the liberation of Pyongyang. In the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, 10,000 kilograms of millet were donated to the families of soldiers. Currently, the city is launching a donation movement of 1,000 yuan per household. In the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement, the performing arts sector has performed more than 40 new storytelling segments and created about 30 new performing arts pieces. Ninety percent of the content of these new performing arts pieces is related to Anti-American and Aid-Korea, and the remaining 10 percent reflects land reform, production, marriage law, etc. Each amusement venue has more than 6,000 to 7,000 listeners every day. In the Anti-American and Aid-Korea and Home-Defense Movement, the medical sector actively organized medical teams, with 167 people applying to register. Some traditional Chinese medicine doctors are striving to participate in the medical team and working hard to learn war trauma surgery. Christians in the religious sector believe that it is useless to simply pray for peace in churches in the past, but should be with the broad masses and strive for peace through action, and formulated seven Christian patriotic pledges to ensure that they resolutely sever ties with imperialism in thought and action.

　　徐州市抗美援朝运动的深度和广度
    本报特约记者　史敬棠
    徐州市抗美援朝保家卫国运动，大体上可以划分为三个阶段。第一阶段，自去年十一月四日各民主党派发表联合宣言，到十二月二日徐州市保卫世界和平反对美国侵略分会成立。这一阶段，主要是开展党内外时事学习与时事宣传，澄清干部群众在抗美援朝保家卫国运动的新形势下所产生的混乱思想；第二个阶段，自徐州市保卫世界和平反对美国侵略分会成立，至今年二月二十五日全市各界人民抗美援朝代表会议。这一阶段的主要特点，是统一领导，全面展开抗美援朝保家卫国运动，并将这一爱国运动的热情贯彻到实际工作中去，各单位普遍订立爱国公约或行动纲领；第三阶段，自徐州市各界人民抗美援朝代表会议召开，到目前为止，这一阶段的特点，主要是求得运动的巩固与发展，普遍与深入。
    徐州市这一次抗美援朝运动规模之大，超过已往任何一次群众运动。据不完全的统计，分别举行的职工代表会议、学生代表会议、机关代表会议、青年团代表会议、中苏友好协会会员代表会议以及全市性抗美援朝代表会议，参加的代表人数约计有三千左右。这些代表都是各界群众中的积极分子，通过他们教育群众扩大影响，这个数字就很难以计算。各界分别举行的控诉会，前后共有两次，一次控诉美帝国主义侵略罪行，一次控诉日寇的罪行，参加的人数约计五万余人。最近又举行了广播控诉大会，组织收听的群众超过十万以上。其影响范围不仅是本市的群众，还包括本市周围的铜山、铜北、萧县、单县等。只单县一个县的收音站即组织了四千余人收听。分别举行的职工、学生、妇女、工商界、宗教界和曲艺界的反美爱国示威游行，参加的人数约有六万余人。最近一次的全市各界人民反对美帝国主义重新武装日本示威大游行，人数超过过去任何一次。参加示威游行的群众约有十万人，站在游行行列两旁街道上助威的群众亦达十万人以上。总起来说，先后受到抗美援朝教育并参加这一运动的群众，约有二十万人以上，占全市的总人口数三分之二强。
    这一次运动的面也比较广泛，包括工人、农民、学生、工商、妇女、医务、文化各界甚至与帝国主义联系较深的宗教界，也都参加了这一运动行列，积极从事各种活动。过去从来不过问政治的八、九十岁的老年人，在这次举行反对美帝国主义重新武装日本示威游行时，自动组织一个四十余人的老人队，参加游行，队伍整齐，沿途不断高呼口号，一直坚持到游行的终点，这都是以往所没有见到过的现象。
    就这次运动的深度来说，不仅扫除了亲美、崇美、恐美情绪，树立起民族自尊心、自信心，而且把抗美援朝保家卫国的热情贯彻到行动中，变成实际的力量。如全市十六个主要厂矿的工人群众开展了爱国主义生产竞赛，有一八七个生产小组向马恒昌小组应战。工人阶级的生产情绪高涨，在生产上创造了伟大的成就。贾汪煤矿每人每日产煤量今年一月份平均达到○·五四二吨，较去年十月份提高了百分之八十六。铁路职工从自动的举行了消灭事故的签名和宣言后，一九○九号机车包乘组已胜利完成了十万公里安全行驶，现正为完成二十万公里无事故而努力。农民群众在一般的地区（灾区除外）已胜利地完成结束土地改革任务，并在“抗美援朝、看住大门”、“保卫翻身果实”的口号下，扩大了民兵，据铜山县一区的统计，全区的民兵已由二百二十二人扩大到四百八十四人。农民分得土地后积极迎接春耕大生产。阎山乡一个乡今年增加牲口百余头。学生在抗美援朝运动中最突出的表现就是响应祖国的号召，掀起报名参加军事干部学校的热潮，前后二次，共计报名的有二千五百多人，约占全体学生总数的百分之五十。全市五千余师生共制慰问袋一万二千余个，写慰问信八千余封。仅就小学校的统计，就举行了近百次的街头宣传，观众约在五万人以上。在寒假中，小学校还组织土地改革宣传队，深入农村宣传，地区包括三十五个乡，七十余个村子，共演出剧六十二次，杂耍六十六次，漫画展览九十次，口头讲话七十三次，拉洋片七十五次，观众共达五万余人。工商界首先制订五项爱国公约，作为自己的行动纲领。各行业又根据自己具体情况订出业务公约。现已有三十四个行业制订出自己的业务公约。为实践公约保证缴税任务之完成，工商界发动了集体纳税，现已有六个行业提前集体缴纳税款。消灭了过去逃税、漏税、拖、推等不法现象。在捐献运动中，工商界在平壤解放祝捷会上捐献救护汽车一辆。在拥军优属工作中，赠送军属小米一万斤。现全市又开展了一户一千元捐献运动，曲艺界在抗美援朝运动中，说唱新曲段，总计有四十多段，创作新曲艺约三十多段。这些新曲艺的内容百分之九十有关抗美援朝，其余百分之十反映土地改革、生产、婚姻法等。各游艺场所每天都拥有六七千以上的听众。医务界在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，积极组织医疗队，申请报名的已达一百六十七人。若干中医为争取参加医疗队努力学习战伤外科。宗教界基督教徒认为过去单单在教堂祈祷和平是没有用的，而应该与广大群众在一起，用行动争取和平，并制订基督教七项爱国公约，保证在思想上、行动上坚决与帝国主义割断联系。
