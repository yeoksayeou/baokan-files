    Learn From Granny Yao
    Zhou Li of the Logistics Department of the Air Defense Command wrote:
    After reading the article "Granny Yao Captures Special Agent Barehanded" on the front page of the People's Daily on April 2nd, I was deeply moved. I think that Granny Yao's spirit of loving the motherland and protecting the interests of the people is very worthy of being learned by the people of the whole country.
    The acts of spreading rumors, sabotage, arson, and murder by the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents and bandits have brought great losses to the Chinese people, which cannot be tolerated. Not long ago, the Central People's Government promulgated the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries," and recently, newspapers have published a series of news about the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. We believe that this high-profile approach is correct and is welcomed by the people of the whole country.
    However, to truly and thoroughly complete this task, it is not enough to rely solely on the government. It also depends on the assistance of the broad masses of the people to the government, that is, everyone must be vigilant, like Granny Yao, to understand the situation of those counter-revolutionary elements and monitor their actions at all times and places, so that they can report to the government when necessary.

    向姚大娘学习
    防空司令部后勤部周礼来信说：
    看到四月二日人民日报第一版所载《姚大娘徒手捉特务》一文后，我非常感动。我觉得像姚大娘这样热爱祖国、保卫人民利益的精神，是很值得全国人民向他学习的。
    美帝国主义和蒋介石的特务匪徒，到处造谣、破坏、烧杀的行为，已给中国人民带来很大损失，这是不能为人容忍的。不久前中央人民政府颁布了“惩治反革命条例”，最近报纸上一连串发表了许多关于镇压反革命的新闻，我们相信这种大张旗鼓的作法是正确的，是为全国人民称快的。
    但真正要彻底完成这一任务，只靠政府还是不够的，还有赖于广大人民对于政府的协助，那就是要每个人都警惕起来，像姚大娘这样，随时随地了解那些反革命分子的情况和监视他们的行动，等必要时好向政府报告。
