　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th: Singapore dispatch: The American imperialist "Educational Investigation Group" dispatched to Malaya in February is still continuing its activities in Malaya, openly directing the British colonial authorities in Malaya to further destroy the overseas Chinese education cause. D.W.T. Barwell, the assistant colonial secretary of the Malayan British colonial government, revealed to reporters in Kuala Lumpur that the group's mission is to conduct a broad investigation of Chinese education for overseas Chinese in Malaya, and then draft a so-called plan to "Malayanize" overseas Chinese education, so as to turn overseas Chinese education into a slave education. The content of the plan is to compile textbooks for overseas Chinese schools "with Malaya as the background and content" instead of China, and stipulate that English and Malay be compulsory subjects. The group also provides the local British colonial government with advice on "training teachers for Chinese schools."
