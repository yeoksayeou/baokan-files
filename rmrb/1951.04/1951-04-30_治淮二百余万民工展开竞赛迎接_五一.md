　　Over Two Million Workers on Huai River Project Launch Competition to Welcome "May Day"

　　The 2.2 million-strong labor army engaged in fundamentally harnessing the Huai River is holding a patriotic labor competition to welcome the great "May Day" International Labor Day. Before the start of the movement, the vast number of workers held grievance meetings in units of platoons or brigades to denounce the atrocities of the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. At the grievance meetings, the workers universally enhanced their enthusiasm and determination to resist America and aid Korea. The labor army of over two million people unanimously formulated a patriotic pact, guaranteeing that all projects would meet standards, improve labor efficiency, and return home after completing their tasks. Subsequently, a fervent patriotic labor competition movement unfolded along the thousand-mile Huai River line. To ensure the smooth progress of the competition movement, the front (referring to those working on the construction site) and the rear (referring to those engaged in production in the villages) signed mutual guarantee contracts: the front guaranteed the completion of the project, and the rear guaranteed no delay in production; at the same time, the front and the rear earnestly carried out the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. This greatly stabilized and encouraged the workers' morale. Labor efficiency has generally doubled compared to the winter repairs of last year. For example, in the lower reaches of northern Jiangsu province, the labor efficiency for repairing the canal embankment was 0.75 cubic meters (difficult work) during the winter repairs last year. Currently, it is 1.5 cubic meters during the spring repairs. In many areas in the upper, middle, and lower reaches, the task was completed half a month to twenty days ahead of schedule during the sixty-day spring repairs.

　　治淮二百余万民工展开竞赛迎接“五一”
    根治淮河的二百二十万劳动大军，举行爱国劳动竞赛，迎接伟大的“五一”国际劳动节。运动开始前，广大民工以中队或大队为单位，举行控诉日寇及蒋匪暴行的诉苦会。在诉苦会上，民工们普遍提高了抗美援朝的热情和决心。二百余万劳动大军一致订出爱国公约，保证所有工程合乎标准，提高劳动效率，完成任务再回家。此后，千里治淮线上，即热烈展开爱国劳动竞赛运动。为保证竞赛运动顺利开展，前方（指在工地劳动的人）与后方（指在村里生产的人）订出互相保证合同：前方保证完成工程，后方保证不误生产；同时前方与后方认真进行镇压反革命的工作。这样，便大大安定与鼓舞了民工的工作情绪。劳动效率，较去年冬修一般都提高了一倍。如下游苏北区培修运河河堤，去年冬修劳动效率为零点七五公方（难工），目前春修为一点五公方，上中下游有不少地区在春修六十天期间，提前半个月至二十天完成任务。
