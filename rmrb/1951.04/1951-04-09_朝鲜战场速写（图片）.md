    Sketches from the Korean Battlefield (Pencil Drawing) (Nine)
    Comrade Lin Tianfa, a machine gunner in a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, repelled eight enemy assaults in one day during the battle to defend the Han River. In another operation, he killed more than ninety enemies. This time, he was ordered to defend a certain high ground. Because the enemy's artillery fire destroyed the machine gun mount, he was buried in the soil. When he crawled out of the soil, the enemy had already begun their assault. Lin Tianfa picked up the machine gun and placed it on his own thigh to fire at the enemy. Later, he was burned by fire, but he persisted in staying on the front line. When the enemy charged, he killed more than twenty more enemies. Finally, he went down to bandage his wounds upon the order of the company commander. After bandaging, he picked up five hand grenades and returned to the position. Because of his bravery, tenacity, calmness, and decisiveness, he was awarded two Class A Merits.

    林天发同志，他是人民志愿军某部机枪连射手，在这次守备汉江的战役中，他曾在一天内打退敌人八次冲锋，另一次作战中击毙敌人九十余名，这一次他奉命守在某一高地，因为敌人炮火炸坏了机枪架，他也被埋在土里，当他从土里爬出来时，敌人已开始冲锋，林天发就端起机枪身放在自己大腿上向敌人射击，后来他又被火烧伤了，坚持不下火线，当敌人冲锋时，又打死了敌人二十多名，最后由于连长命令，他才下去包扎了伤口，等包扎后，他又拾了五个手榴弹，回到阵地上，由于他的英勇顽强，沉着果敢，曾立大功两次。
