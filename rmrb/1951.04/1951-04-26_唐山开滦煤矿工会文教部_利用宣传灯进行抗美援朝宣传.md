Tangshan Kailuan Coal Mine Trade Union Cultural and Educational Department
    Utilizes Propaganda Lights for Resist America, Aid Korea Propaganda

Comrade Editor:
    The Tangshan Kailuan Coal Mine Trade Union Cultural and Educational Department uses propaganda lights to conduct Resist America, Aid Korea and various policy and current affairs propaganda, which is very popular among the masses. Before the Spring Festival last year, we mobilized the primary school teachers of the Tangshan Mine to draw thirty-two historical pictures of American imperialism's aggression against China, and made several lamps measuring one foot and eight inches square. We hung the lamps with propaganda paintings on the flower wall of the Xishankou Club. The Xishankou Club is the central area of Tangshan City. The propaganda lights attract many pedestrians every day, and especially after the lights are turned on at night, it is even more crowded with spectators. During the Spring Festival period, farmers from the four villages and towns, as well as citizens and workers' families, saw the true face of the American imperialist wolf and its sinister and ruthless methods of harming the Chinese people from these pictures.
    When the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries" were promulgated, we drew the contents of the regulations and the materials of our mine's accusations against the crimes of counterrevolutionaries into cartoons and posted them on the lights for propaganda.
    Recently, we also combined the declaration requesting the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, the introduction of "May Day" and the songs to be sung during the "May Day" demonstration parade, with cartoons about the peace declaration, cartoons against American imperialism's support of Japan, etc., and promptly publicized them on the lights in the factory and the Xishankou Club. According to our experience, this method of propaganda is very effective in cities.

### 唐山开滦煤矿工会文教部  利用宣传灯进行抗美援朝宣传

　　唐山开滦煤矿工会文教部
    利用宣传灯进行抗美援朝宣传编辑同志：
    唐山开滦煤矿工会文教部用宣传灯进行抗美援朝及各种政策时事宣传，很受群众欢迎。去年春节前，我们动员了唐山矿的小学教师，画了三十二幅美帝国主义侵华历史图画，并作了几个一英尺八英寸见方的灯，把贴有宣传画的灯，挂在西山口俱乐部的花墙上。西山口俱乐部是唐山市的中心区，宣传灯每天吸引很多行人，特别是夜间灯亮之后，更是围满观众。在春节期中，四乡来的农民和市民、工人家属等，从这些画面上看到了美帝国主义这只野心狼的真面目，和它残害中国人民的阴险毒辣手段。
    当《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》公布后，我们便将条例的内容和我们矿上控诉反革命分子罪行的材料画成漫画，贴在灯上进行宣传。
    最近，我们并将要求缔结五大国和平公约宣言、“五一”介绍及在“五一”示威大游行时要唱的歌，配合着有关和平宣言的漫画，反对美帝国主义扶植日本的漫画等，也在厂内和西山口俱乐部的灯上及时宣传出去。根据我们的经验，在城市里用这办法进行宣传效果是很好的。
