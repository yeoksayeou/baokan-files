Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The "Conference on Handling Relief Organizations Receiving US Subsidies," convened by the Committee for Handling Relief Organizations Receiving US Subsidies under the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, opened in Beijing on the 26th. Attendees included representatives from national relief and welfare organizations receiving US subsidies, representatives from larger relief organizations across the country receiving US and other foreign subsidies, representatives from religious relief and welfare departments, as well as representatives from local civil affairs departments and local branches of the Chinese People's Relief Society, totaling one hundred and sixteen people.

　　A preparatory meeting was held on the 25th, which elected Xie Juezai, Chen Qiyuan, Chen Chuangang, Kang Keqing, Xiong Jinding, Zhang Yuanshan, Pu Huaren, Wu Yunfu and twenty-three others to form the presidium. Wu Yunfu, Secretary-General of the Committee for Handling Relief Organizations Receiving US Subsidies under the Government Administration Council, reported on the preparations for the conference. The task of this conference is to handle the aforementioned relief organizations and institutions in accordance with the Government Administration Council's "Decision on the Policy for Handling Cultural, Educational, and Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Receiving US Subsidies."

　　Xie Juezai, Director of the Committee for Handling Relief Organizations Receiving US Subsidies under the Government Administration Council, delivered a speech at the opening of the conference on the 26th. He used many concrete facts to illustrate the achievements of the new China's relief and welfare undertakings, explaining the essential difference between the new China's relief work and the old society's relief work, as well as the "relief" work of imperialism. Imperialism, under the guise of "relief," "charity," and "religion," carried out aggression and harmed the lives of Chinese children. Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate this kind of "relief" and unite the Chinese personnel in the original relief organizations and institutions to jointly carry out the relief and welfare work of the new China.

　　Guo Moruo, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, made a report to the conference. He pointed out that the root cause of the Chinese people's disasters is imperialism. Imperialism, in conjunction with China's feudal forces and bureaucratic comprador class, created disasters in China and then pretended to be compassionate and carried out "relief." After imperialism had battered China full of holes, it applied a few plasters. This is a great deception and insult to the Chinese people. The relief and welfare community should resolutely wash away this insult. He called on the relief and welfare community, especially the Chinese personnel of relief organizations receiving US subsidies, to participate in the anti-imperialist patriotic movement and actively participate in the signing of the peace pact and the voting movement against the United States arming Japan.

　　The conference also listened to Wu Yunfu's report on the "Implementation Measures for Handling Relief Organizations and Institutions Receiving US Subsidies." He expressed the hope that everyone would unite and do a good job in the takeover work. The relief work of the Chinese people should be done by the Chinese people themselves, and it will certainly be done better than before.

　　Xinhua News Agency: Soong Ching Ling, Chairman of the Chinese People's Relief Society, sent a telegram congratulating the opening of the Conference on Handling Relief Organizations Receiving US Subsidies. The text of the telegram is as follows:

　　Chinese People's Relief Society, Beijing, forwarded to the Conference on Handling Relief Organizations Receiving US Subsidies:

　　I am delighted to learn that the Conference on Handling Relief Organizations Receiving US Subsidies has been convened in Beijing. I deeply hope that all representatives will expose the false masks of US imperialism to the Chinese people as much as possible, and further unite the Chinese staff within the relief organizations receiving US subsidies, firmly stand on the people's side, love the motherland, and serve the people's relief and welfare undertakings of the new China. I also hope to work together with the people of the whole country to fight against US aggression and aid Korea and defend world peace! I send this telegram to express my regards and wish you success.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Soong Ching Ling

　　政务院召集全国救济福利界代表开会
　  处理接受美国津贴救济机关
  　人民救济总会主席宋庆龄电贺会议开幕
    【新华社二十六日讯】中央人民政府政务院处理接受美国津贴救济机关委员会召集的“处理接受美国津贴救济机关会议”，于二十六日在北京开幕。出席会议者包括接受美国津贴的全国性的救济福利社团代表，全国各地规模较大的接受美国以及其他外国津贴的救济机关代表，宗教界有关救济福利部门代表，以及各地民政部门与中国人民救济总会地方分会的代表，共有一百一十六人。
    会议于二十五日举行预备会，推选了谢觉哉、陈其瑗、陈传纲、康克清、熊瑾玎、章元善、浦化人、伍云甫等二十三人为主席团，并由政务院处理接受美国津贴救济机关委员会秘书长伍云甫报告会议筹备经过。这次会议的任务是依据政务院关于“处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定”，对上述救济社团及救济机关进行处理。
    政务院处理接受美国津贴救济机关委员会主任谢觉哉于二十六日会议开幕时致词。他以许多具体事实说明新中国的救济福利事业的成就，说明新中国的救济事业与旧社会的救济事业以及帝国主义的“救济”事业本质上的不同，帝国主义假借“救济”、“慈善”和“宗教”的名义进行侵略，并残害中国儿童的生命。因此必须肃清这种“救济”，团结原有救济社团与救济机关中的中国人员共同来进行新中国的救济福利工作。
    政务院文化教育委员会主任郭沫若向大会作了报告。他指出：中国人民灾难的总根源即是帝国主义。帝国主义结合了中国的封建势力和官僚买办阶级在中国造成灾难后，又来中国假装慈悲，进行“救济”。帝国主义把中国打得千孔百疮后，又给贴上几片膏药。这是对中国人民的极大欺骗和侮辱。救济福利界应坚决地洗清这种侮辱。他号召救济福利界特别是接受美国津贴的救济机关的中国人员应参加反帝爱国运动，积极参加关于缔结和平公约的签名及反对美国武装日本的投票运动。
    大会还听取了伍云甫关于“处理接受美国津贴的救济社团和救济机关的实施办法”的报告。他希望大家团结起来，做好接收工作，中国人民的救济事业应由中国人民自己来办，而且一定比以前办得更好。
    【新华社讯】中国人民救济总会主席宋庆龄电贺处理接受美国津贴的救济机关会议开幕。电文如下：
    北京中国人民救济总会转处理接受美国津贴的救济机关会议：
    欣悉处理接受美国津贴的救济机关会议在北京召开，本人深盼各代表尽量将美国帝国主义假面具揭露于中国人民之前，进而团结接受美国津贴的救济机关内之中国籍工作人员，坚决站在人民立场上，热爱祖国，为新中国的人民救济福利事业服务。并望与全国人民一道，为抗美援朝、保卫世界和平而奋斗！特电致意，预祝成功。
          宋庆龄
