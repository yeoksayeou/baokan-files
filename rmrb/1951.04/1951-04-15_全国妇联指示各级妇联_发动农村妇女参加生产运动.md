The All-China Democratic Women's Federation, in order to mobilize rural women to actively participate in the patriotic production movement and strive for a bumper harvest nationwide this year, has issued instructions to democratic women's federations at all levels. The instructions require democratic women's federations at all levels to actively assist the government in more widely mobilizing and organizing large numbers of rural women (including suburban farmers) to participate in the patriotic production movement, and together with male farmers, ensure the realization of the task of a bumper harvest. To this end, the instructions put forward the following suggestions to democratic women's federations at all levels:

	1. It is necessary to widely publicize the production tasks and production policies stipulated in the 1951 decision of the Central People's Government's State Council on agricultural and forestry production, as well as the local people's government's plan for agricultural production increase, and provide appropriate assistance for their implementation. In carrying out propaganda and education, it should be combined with the popularization and deepening of patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, so that every woman knows that her active production can not only lead to prosperity in life and improve the economic status of women, but also strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and protecting the homeland, which is a glorious and sacred task, not a "suffering" and "despicable" thing, to encourage women to actively participate in the patriotic production movement. To this end, for rural women, not only should propaganda and education be carried out as for male farmers, but also special efforts should be made for women in various ways and opportunities. On the basis of fully mobilizing women's thinking, mobilize them to participate in all possible agricultural labor, and do a good job in preparing for the busy farming season, ensuring that the annual agricultural production does not violate the farming season, especially the work of soaking seeds, mixing seeds, selecting seeds, and catching insects to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests, which should be universally and extensively mobilized for women to participate in. In areas producing cotton, hemp, and tobacco, emphasis should be placed on mobilizing women to assist in the home with planting more cotton, hemp, and tobacco, and undertaking the processing of these products. Attention should also be paid to combining agricultural production with mobilizing women to feed draught animals, raise livestock, restore special products, and participate in other handicrafts and sideline production.

	2. Continue to mobilize women to participate in the exchange of labor, mutual assistance, and cooperative undertakings. First of all, education on organizing should be carried out to make women understand that organizing can improve production efficiency, learn technology, prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests, develop sideline industries, solve production difficulties, and increase production, which is the road to prosperity. In carrying out mutual assistance, the principles of voluntariness, mutual benefit, and democracy must be adhered to. In areas where the exchange of labor and mutual assistance have a foundation, it is possible to promote appropriate division of labor between men and women, help women learn technology, combine agricultural and sideline production, rationally utilize women's labor force, and mutual assistance between young and middle-aged women and elderly women, and solve production difficulties with each other. Various localities can also, according to their specific circumstances, combine with "organizing" to mobilize women to actively participate in formulating production plans for the whole family, production plans for the whole group or village, etc., and participate in activities such as evaluation and competition, and labor models to enrich the content of the patriotic production movement. In newly liberated areas, the original habits of the masses should be followed, the experience of the old liberated areas should be used, and the organization of exchange of labor and mutual assistance should be promoted, and coercion should be strictly prevented.

	3. Universally promote women to learn and improve agricultural production technology, especially to learn the technology that is urgently needed in current agricultural production and is suitable for women's physical strength, such as cotton topping, pruning, cotton harvesting, tobacco harvesting, tobacco curing, hemp harvesting, prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, prevention and treatment of livestock and poultry diseases, etc. For technologies that require greater physical strength to master, a cautious approach should be adopted, and attention must be paid to women's physical strength, and one should not aim too high.

	4. Attention should be paid to solving the difficulties faced by women in participating in production as much as possible and satisfying women's reasonable and achievable demands, because this is an important link in inspiring women's enthusiasm and persistence in production, and it is also an indispensable work to promote the cause of women's liberation from the production movement. For example, promote the organization of young and middle-aged and elderly women to exchange labor and take care of children, organize baby-holding groups, nurseries during busy farming seasons, and other methods to take good care of children so that mothers can work in production with peace of mind. According to the laws of the People's Government and the degree of awareness of the local masses, appropriately solve problems such as women being subjected to domestic abuse, marital dissatisfaction, family disharmony, and foot binding, and further promote the establishment of democratic and harmonious families, and enable women to appropriately enjoy the fruits of production. Persuasion and education should be carried out against thoughts and behaviors that restrict women from participating in production and social activities.

	5. Democratic women's federations at all levels should use the form of women's representative conferences at all levels (especially township and village women's representative conferences) to lead women to participate in agricultural production. Past experience has proved that this is the best and most powerful organization for timely reflecting women's opinions on production, arranging production tasks, exchanging production experience, solving difficulties in production, and at the same time, carrying out inspection and supervision work.

Democratic women's federations at all levels should, according to the agricultural production increase plan of the local people's government, make specific plans for how to mobilize and organize women to participate in agricultural production this year; and maintain close cooperation with relevant departments of the people's government. At meetings related to agricultural production convened by governments at all levels, cadres of democratic women's federations or female representatives of people's congresses should actively put forward opinions on mobilizing women to participate in production at the meetings, and put forward specific suggestions on women's participation in agricultural production when formulating the entire agricultural production plan, so as to assist the government in promoting women's participation in production more smoothly. Democratic women's federations above the county level should lead women cadres to earnestly study relevant agricultural production policies and the local government's agricultural and forestry production plan, learn agricultural knowledge, master production technology; and seize all possible opportunities to mobilize female cadres, female representatives, and female production models and activists to participate in various agricultural technology training classes organized locally.

　　全国妇联指示各级妇联
    发动农村妇女参加生产运动
    中华全国民主妇女联合会为了发动农村妇女积极参加爱国生产运动，争取今年全国农产丰收，特给各级民主妇女联合会发出指示。该指示要求各级民主妇女联合会积极协助政府，更广泛地动员和组织大批农村妇女（包括城市的郊区农妇在内）参加爱国生产运动，与男农民一起，保证农产丰收任务的实现。为此，该指示向各级民主妇女联合会提出以下几点建议：
    １、必须大量宣传一九五一年中央人民政府政务院的农林生产决定中所规定的生产任务及生产政策和当地人民政府的农业增产计划，并加以适当的协助，以便贯彻执行。在进行宣传教育时，应与普及和深入抗美援朝爱国主义的宣传教育相结合，使每个妇女都知道自己的积极生产，不仅可以使生活走向富裕，提高妇女的经济地位，而且能加强抗美援朝、保家卫国的工作，这是光荣的神圣的任务，而不是“受苦”的“下贱”事情，以鼓励妇女积极参加爱国生产运动。为此，对农村妇女，不仅要和对男农民一样地进行宣传教育，还要通过各种方式各种机会，对妇女特别加一把力。在妇女思想充分发动的基础上，动员她们参加一切可能参加的农业劳动，并做好农忙准备工作，保证全年农业生产不违农时，特别是浸种、拌种、选种、抓虫等防治病虫害的工作，更要普遍大量发动妇女参加。在产棉、麻、烟的地区要着重动员妇女协助，家庭多种棉、麻、烟，及担任这些产品的加工工作。并注意结合农业生产发动妇女喂养耕畜，养育家畜，恢复特产及参加其他手工业、副业生产。
    ２、继续发动妇女参加变工、互助和合作事业。首先应进行组织起来的教育，使妇女了解组织起来可以提高生产效率，学习技术，防除病虫害，发展副业，解决生产困难，以增加产量，是走向富裕的道路。在进行互助中必须坚持自愿、两利与民主的原则。在变工互助有基础的地区，可提倡男女适当分工，帮助妇女学习技术，农、副业生产相结合，合理运用妇女的劳动力，青壮年妇女和老年妇女互助，互相解决生产困难等。各地并可根据当地具体情况，结合“组织起来”动员妇女积极参加订立全家的生产计划，全组或全村的生产计划等，参加评比竞赛、劳动模范等运动，以丰富爱国主义的生产运动的内容。新解放区应根据群众原有的习惯，运用老解放区的经验，提倡组织起来变工互助，严防强迫命令。
    ３、普遍提倡妇女学习并提高农业生产技术，特别要学会目前农业生产中所急需的而又适合妇女体力的技术，如棉花的打尖、打杈、收棉、收烟、烤烟、收麻，防除病虫害，防治耕畜，家禽的瘟病等技术。对于学习需要较大的体力才能掌握的技术，应该采取慎重的方针，务必注意妇女的体力情况，不要好高鹜远。
    ４、要注意尽可能地解决妇女参加生产中的困难与满足妇女的合理而又可能实现的要求，因为这是启发妇女生产积极性和持久性的重要一环，又是从生产运动中推进妇女解放事业的不可忽视的工作。例如提倡组织青壮年和老年妇女变工看孩子，组织抱娃娃组、农忙托儿所等办法，带好孩子，使母亲安心生产。根据人民政府的法律，当地群众的觉悟程度，适当解决妇女受家庭虐待，婚姻不满，家庭不和，束胸缠足等问题，进一步提倡建立民主和睦的家庭，并使妇女能适当地享受到生产成果。对于限制妇女参加生产，参加社会活动的思想、行为，要进行说服教育。
    ５、各级民主妇女联合会要运用各级妇女代表会议（特别是乡和村妇女代表会议）的方式，来领导妇女参加农业生产。过去的经验证明，这是及时反映妇女群众对生产的意见，布置生产任务，交流生产经验，解决生产中的困难，同时又是进行检查和督促工作的最好的最有力的组织。
    各级民主妇女联合会应根据当地人民政府的农业增产计划，作出今年如何发动和组织妇女参加农业生产的具体计划；经常与人民政府有关部门取得密切配合。在各级政府召开的有关农业生产的会议上，民主妇女联合会的干部或人民代表会议的女代表要在会议上主动提出发动妇女参加生产的意见，并在制订整个农业生产计划时提出有关妇女参加农业生产的具体建议，以便协助政府更顺利地推动妇女参加生产的工作。县以上的民主妇女联合会要领导妇女干部认真学习有关农业生产的政策及当地政府的农林生产计划，要学习农业知识，掌握生产技术；要抓紧一切可能的机会，动员女干部、女代表及妇女生产模范、积极分子，参加当地开办的各种农业技术训练班等。
