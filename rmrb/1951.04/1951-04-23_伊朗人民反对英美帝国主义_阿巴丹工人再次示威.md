　　Iranian People Oppose Anglo-American Imperialism
　　Abadan Workers Demonstrate Again
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 19th] Two thousand striking workers in Abadan, Iran, held another demonstration against Anglo-American imperialism on the 16th. In the oil field area, 27,000 workers are still on strike. As a result, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's huge refineries in Abadan and Kermanshah (north of Abadan) were forced to shut down completely on the 15th, and remained shut down on the 17th. Strikes by workers in Isfahan and movements against imperialists are also continuing.
　　The statement made by the American Ambassador to Iran, Grady, on the 15th, regarding American "concern about Iranian oil," even aroused criticism from Iranian bourgeois newspapers. The influential "Keyhan" newspaper commented on Grady's statement on the 16th, saying: "Our oil is ours, just as American oil is American, and British coal is British. If they (Britain and the United States) insist on their own way on this issue, we will not sell our oil to them, and we will find other customers." The newspaper accused Grady's statement of "interfering in Iran's internal affairs."

　　伊朗人民反对英美帝国主义
　  阿巴丹工人再次示威
    【新华社十九日讯】伊朗阿巴丹的罢工工人两万人，于十六日再次举行反对英、美帝国主义的示威游行。在该地油田地区，二万七千名工人仍在坚持罢工。结果英伊石油公司在阿巴丹和基尔曼沙（阿巴丹北部）的巨大炼油厂，自十五日起即被迫全部停工，迄十七日仍在停工状态中。伊斯法罕工人的罢工和反对帝国主义者的运动也在继续中。
    美国驻伊朗大使格拉第十五日发表的关于美国“关心伊朗石油”的声明，甚至引起伊朗资产阶级报纸的抨击。有影响的“基汉报”十六日在评论格拉第的声明时说：“我们的石油是我们的，正如美国的石油是美国的，英国的煤是英国的一样。如果它们（英国和美国）在这个问题上坚持己见，我们就不把我们的石油卖给它们，我们将会找到另外的主顾。”该报指责格拉第的声明是“干涉伊朗内政”。
