　　Reading “Tianjin Workers’ Painting Collection” and “Factory Sketch Collection”
　　Cai Ruohong
    In the past two years, both the fine art creations depicting workers' lives and the workers' own art exercises, such as the large number of amateur creations by workers published in factory wall newspapers and workers' reading materials, have achieved considerable success. The "Factory Sketch Collection" and "Tianjin Workers' Painting Collection," edited by Comrade A Ying and published by Shanghai Chenguang Publishing Company, can serve as examples to illustrate this achievement.

    "Factory Sketch Collection" consists of sketches made by the author while understanding the lives of workers. It includes portraits of workers and sketches of workers' production labor and social activities. This kind of exercise is a necessary process for art workers to familiarize themselves with and depict the lives and images of workers. Although they are all fragmentary scenes, from the subjects selected by the author, it can be seen that the focus is on expressing the new labor attitude of the working class. The author does not aimlessly depict machines, does not emphasize the exotic view of workers' special images, and does not focus on using light and shadow or atmosphere to compensate for the shortcomings of the main characters' images. The author's learning attitude is correct, and only with such a learning attitude can one correctly portray the image of workers and continuously obtain the source of creation. How to concentrate various individual images, find representative images of the working class, and depict them is an important task for art workers at present.

    "Tianjin Workers' Painting Collection" includes the exercises of twenty workers. These worker painters are scattered in various production units, but their works share a common point, which is the working class's spirit of being masters of their own affairs. Their production competitions, their tool improvements, their prevention of accidents, and their efforts in invention and creation all stem from their master-like labor attitude. They are better at grasping the theme than art workers because the theme in the works is precisely the theme in their lives. They use expressive forms without restraint because in their minds, there are few rigid dogmas to hinder them from using various forms.

    Of course, strictly speaking in terms of expression techniques, the worker painters' exercises are still in their infancy, and are relatively naive mass exercises. However, precisely because these works have a mass character, we must not underestimate its wide-ranging effect among the masses. Therefore, in guiding workers' art activities, we cannot simply focus on cultivating their skills. We cannot currently cultivate a large number of art experts among the working class, so skill cultivation is not the goal. The goal is to help them learn how to use certain techniques to express their own splendid lives.

    Developing workers' artistic talents and guiding workers' artistic creation is the unshirkable responsibility of art workers who serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. Conversely, art workers can also absorb nourishment from workers' art exercises and further improve their own thinking and art.

　　读《天津工人画集》和《工厂素描集》
    蔡若虹
    两年以来，无论是表现工人生活的美术创作或者是工人自己的美术习作，如大量发表在工厂壁报、工人读物上的工人业余创作，都获得了不少良好的成绩。阿英同志主编，上海晨光出版公司出版的《工厂素描集》和《天津工人画集》，可以作为说明这种成绩的一个例子。
    《工厂素描集》是作者在了解工人生活中的素描习作，这里包括着工人的画像和工人的生产劳动与社会活动的速写，这种习作是美术工作者在熟悉和描绘工人生活和工人形象的必经过程；虽然都是一些片断的画面，但从作者所选择的题材方面，可以看出是以表现工人阶级新的劳动态度为重点；作者在这里没有无目的地描写机器，没有强调工人特殊形象的猎奇观点，没有着重用光暗、气氛来弥补主要人物形象的欠缺的偏向；作者的学习态度是正确的，而且只有在这样的学习态度之下，才能正确地刻划工人形象和不断地取得创作的源泉。如何将各种个别的形象集中起来，找出工人阶级中的具有代表性的形象，加以描绘，这是目前美术工作者的一件重要的任务。
    《天津工人画集》则包括着二十个工人的习作，这些工人画家们分散在各个不同的生产单位，可是他们的作品却贯穿着一个共同之点，这就是工人阶级当家作主的主人翁气概。他们的生产竞赛，他们的工具改进，他们的防止事故以及努力于发明创造的精神，也都是从主人翁的劳动态度出发。他们比美术工作者更善于把握主题，因为作品中的主题正是他们生活中的主题。他们毫无拘束地运用表现形式，因为在他们的观念中还很少死板的教条来阻碍他们运用各种形式。
    当然，专从表现技术上说，工人画家们的习作还处于萌芽状态，是比较幼稚的群众性的习作。然而就因为这些作品的具有群众性的缘故，我们绝对不能过低地估计它在群众中的广泛效果。因而在指导工人艺术活动方面，就不能专门是培养他们的技术，我们目前还不可能在工人阶级中大量的培养美术专家，所以技术的培养不是目的，目的是帮助他们如何运用一定的技术来表现他们自己的灿烂生活。
    发挥工人的美术才能，指导工人的美术创作，这是为工农兵服务的美术工作者义不容辞的责任。反过来，美术工作者又可从工人的美术习作中吸收营养，进一步地提高自己的思想和艺术。
