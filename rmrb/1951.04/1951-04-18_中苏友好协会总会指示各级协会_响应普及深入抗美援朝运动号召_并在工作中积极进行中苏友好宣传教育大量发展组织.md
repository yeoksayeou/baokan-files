Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters today issued instructions to all levels of Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations across the country on responding to the call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America, Aid Korea and to carry out the work of the Association. The full text is as follows:

The notice issued by the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America, Aid Korea on March 14 regarding popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement nationwide is, in the view of this Association, entirely correct. All levels of organizations and all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should most resolutely and actively implement it, and in the course of implementation, closely integrate the propaganda and education work of Sino-Soviet friendship with the work of developing the Association's organization on a large scale. This should be the central task of all levels of Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations this year. To this end, the following instructions are specifically given:

(1) All levels of Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations should immediately formulate plans for popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement within this year, combining propaganda and education on Sino-Soviet friendship and the development of organizational work, and immediately issue instructions, decisions, and notices to their subordinates, convene necessary meetings, make specific arrangements, and mobilize the vast membership in various places to immediately and proactively cooperate with all relevant parties to implement the plans conscientiously. Simultaneously with the formulation of this plan, it is necessary to examine the implementation of the decisions of the First National Work Conference of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and summarize the past work experience in coordinating with the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, promote good experiences, and correct shortcomings and deviations.

(2) All levels of branches should flexibly adopt various different forms, use and produce various propaganda and education tools and materials, and launch patriotic and internationalist propaganda and education to the vast membership and non-member masses. Every member of this Association should continue to study in depth, eliminate certain remaining pro-American and fear-of-America thoughts, more deeply understand the Soviet Union's role as a fortress for defending world peace, and further consolidate and develop the great significance of Sino-Soviet friendship in resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending peace. At the same time, every member should strive to conduct propaganda to the vast non-member masses. Cadres and activists at all levels of this Association should work even harder to study, get closer to the masses, so that they have a better understanding of these issues and a better understanding of the masses' ideological situation, in order to more forcefully defeat the enemy's deception and rumors, and overcome certain incorrect thoughts among the masses.

(3) In the upcoming end of April and May, all levels of Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations should actively cooperate with local Resist America, Aid Korea branches to universally convene small meetings of various masses. At these meetings, coordinating with the accusations against the crimes of American and Japanese imperialism and their running dogs, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit secret agents, coordinating with the signing of the peace treaty and voting on the Japan issue, it is necessary to greatly expand the propaganda of Sino-Soviet friendship; it is necessary to seize these opportunities to develop the Association's membership on a large scale; in places or units where the Association's organization has not been established, conditions should be used and created to establish the Association's organization as much as possible. In the May Day parade, every member of this Association should actively participate and strive to publicize to the non-member masses, mobilizing them to participate, and special attention should be paid to mobilizing the masses who rarely participate in political activities. After May Day, all appropriate steps should be taken to make this work deep and lasting. All levels of Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations should promptly commend the organizations and members who have made outstanding achievements in this work, and report their successful experiences to their subordinates for universal promotion.

(4) Local branches should promptly report the plans and implementation of this work to the headquarters level by level.

                April 17th

    【新华社十七日讯】中苏友好协会总会今日发出为响应中国人民抗美援朝总会号召、开展本会工作给全国各级中苏友好协会的指示。全文如下：
    中国人民抗美援朝总会三月十四日所发出的关于在全国普及深入抗美援朝运动的通知，本会认为是完全正确的。中苏友好协会的各级组织和全体会员都应该最坚决和最积极地予以执行，并在执行中密切结合中苏友好的宣传教育工作和大量发展本会组织的工作。这应作为各级中苏友好协会本年度的中心任务。为此，特作如下指示：
    （一）各级中苏友好协会应立即制定在本年内普及深入抗美援朝运动，结合中苏友好协会宣传教育和发展组织工作的计划，并立即对所属发出指示、决定、通知，召开必要的会议，作具体的布置，动员各地广大的会员立即主动地配合各有关方面认真执行起来。与这一计划订定的同时，要检查中苏友好协会第一次全国工作会议各项决定的执行情况及总结前此配合抗美援朝运动的工作经验，发扬好的经验，纠正缺点和偏向。
    （二）各级分会应当灵活地采取各种不同的形式，使用和制作各种宣传教育工具和材料，展开对广大会员非会员群众爱国主义与国际主义的宣传教育。本会每一会员均应继续深入学习，肃清某些残存的崇美、恐美思想，更深刻地认识苏联对于保卫世界和平的堡垒作用，以及进一步巩固与发展中苏友好对抗美援朝与保卫和平的重大意义，同时争取每一会员向广大非会员群众进行宣传。本会各级干部和积极分子则应更加努力学习，更加接近广大群众，使自己对这些问题有更好的认识，对群众的思想情况有更好的了解，以便更加有力地击破敌人的欺骗造谣，克服群众中某些不正确的思想。
    （三）在即将到来的四月末和五月份，各级中苏友好协会均应积极配合各地抗美援朝分会，普遍召集各种群众的小型会议。在这些会议上，配合着控诉美、日帝国主义及其走狗蒋匪特务的罪行，配合着拥护和平公约的签名和关于日本问题的投票，要大大扩大中苏友好的宣传；要抓紧这些时机，大量发展本会会员；在未建立本会组织的地方或单位，应运用和创造条件，尽可能地建立起本会的组织。在五一大游行中，本会每一个会员都应积极参加，并努力向非会员群众宣传，发动他们参加，特别应当注意发动平时政治活动很少的群众参加。五一以后，则应采取一切适当的步骤，使这项工作深入和持久。各级中苏友好协会对在这一工作中做出优异成绩的组织和会员，应及时予以表扬，并将其成功的经验通报所属，以便普遍推行。
    （四）各地分会应将关于这一工作的计划和执行情况迅速逐级报告总会。
                四月十七日
