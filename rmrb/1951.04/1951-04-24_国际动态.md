  Czechoslovakia Expels French Cultural Spies
    The Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs presented a note to the French Embassy in Czechoslovakia on April 12, demanding that the French Aires Denny Academy in Prague and the French Institutes in Brno and Bratislava immediately cease their activities, and ordered that all procedures be completed by May 1, with the French lecturers and staff of the academies leaving Czechoslovakia on the same day. The note pointed out that these institutions had become tools against the Czechoslovak people's democratic system. French lecturers often spread fabricated propaganda about Czechoslovakia, gathered elements hostile to the Czechoslovak Republic around them, and carried out activities against the people's democratic system. Czechoslovakia's measure to expel imperialist cultural spies is a necessary means to protect national sovereignty and consolidate the people's democratic system.
  The Dutch Government's "Generosity"
    The Dutch government has submitted a bill to parliament requesting that the Dutch citizenship of 40,000 war criminals who fought on the side of Hitler's Germany during World War II be restored. These people were deprived of their Dutch citizenship under the Dutch constitution for actively cooperating with German fascists. And the Dutch government is preparing to cooperate with new German fascists!
  Schuman Plan Agreement Signed in Paris
    The foreign ministers of France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the West German puppet government signed the agreement on the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Super Cartel according to the so-called "Schuman Plan" in Paris on the 18th. Adenauer, the "Prime Minister" and "Foreign Minister" of the Bonn "government," signed the agreement first. This fact once again emphasizes the leading role played by the agents of American monopoly capitalists—West German revanchists—in the "unified" West European heavy industry.

  捷克驱逐法国文化间谍
    捷克斯洛伐克外交部于四月十二日向法国驻捷大使馆提出照会，要求法国设在布拉格的艾尔勒斯·丹尼学院及在布尔诺和布拉的斯拉发的法兰西学院立即停止活动，并限令五月一日以前了清一切手续，学院中的法国讲师和职员们于同日离开捷克斯洛伐克。照会指出：这些机构已变成了反对捷克斯洛伐克人民民主制度的工具。法国讲师经常散播伪造的关于捷克斯洛伐克的宣传，把敌对捷克斯洛伐克共和国的分子集结在他们的周围，进行反对人民民主制度的活动。捷克斯洛伐克驱逐帝国主义文化间谍的措施，是保护国家主权、巩固人民民主制度的必要手段。
  荷兰政府的“宽大”
    荷兰政府已向议会提出一项法案，要求将第二次世界大战期间站在希特勒德国一边作战的四万战犯恢复荷兰公民权。这些人是根据荷兰宪法因为与德国法西斯分子积极合作而被褫夺荷兰公民权的。而荷兰政府正准备与新的德国法西斯分子合作哩！
  舒曼计划协定在巴黎签订
    法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡五国及西德傀儡政府的外交部长，十八日在巴黎签订了根据所谓“舒曼计划”建立的欧洲煤钢超级卡特尔的协定。波恩“政府”的“总理”兼“外交部长”阿登纳首先在协定上签字。这一事实再一次地着重表明了美国垄断资本家的代理人——西德复仇主义分子——在“统一”西欧重工业中所担任的领导角色。
