　　Xinhua News Agency Report: The movement against American arming of Japan is continuously expanding in various regions of Central and Southwest China. According to incomplete statistics, over one hundred cities in the four provinces of Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, and Guangdong, thirty-seven cities and counties in Southwest China, and parts of rural areas in both Central and Southwest China have held demonstrations and parades against American arming of Japan. The minority peoples of Xikang Province and western Yunnan Province have also joined this movement, with some places holding rallies and demonstrations. Minority peoples in areas of Yunnan that were invaded by Japanese invaders have been actively denouncing the bloody crimes of the Japanese invaders.
　　
　　In Central China, from the “February 7th” Memorial Day to the “March 8th” Women’s Day, Guangdong Province alone saw demonstrations and parades held by people in more than thirty towns and cities, with some rural areas also holding parades. Over 500,000 people from all walks of life participated in the parades. In Henan Province, approximately 130,000 workers and their families in the cities of Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Zhoukou, and Zhuji, as well as the city of Huangshi in Hubei Province, held demonstrations and parades on the same day, March 18th. Workers in various places have actively responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group, expressing their love for the motherland and their determination to oppose American aggression with practical actions in production competitions.
　　
　　Peasants who have been emancipated in the land reform have also thrown themselves into this patriotic movement with vigorous enthusiasm. In the suburban areas of Wuhan, Ganzhou in Jiangxi, and Xuchang County in Henan Province, over 200,000 peasants have held demonstrations and parades. Guanshuo Township in Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, a village that had been brutally destroyed by the Japanese invaders, had been known as “Miserable Lane” for over a decade. During the land reform, the peasants in this village were allocated land, houses, and some grain and farm tools, and they joyfully changed the name of “Miserable Lane” to “Liberation Lane.” When they heard the news of American imperialism rearming Japan, they firmly stated that they would increase production and organize militias, determined not to allow “Liberation Lane” to return to the misery of “Miserable Lane.”
　　
　　Women, industrialists and businessmen, religious figures, and other people from all walks of life in the cities have been swept up in the patriotic fervor against American arming of Japan. On “March 8th” Women’s Day, 180,000 women in twenty-four towns and cities in Guangdong Province held demonstrations and parades. Industrialists and businessmen in various places have generally put forward the slogan of “Monthly tax payment and fulfillment of patriotic pledges.” On March 18th, over 140,000 people from 158 industries in Wuhan held a grand demonstration and parade. In Wuhan, Haikou, Nanchang, Nanyang, Linying, and other places, religious figures have participated in demonstrations and parades. Catholics and Christians in Nanyang City have said: Believers cannot just pray for peace; they must take active action to strive for peace and defend peace.
　　
　　In order to make this movement more widespread and in-depth, propaganda weeks have been designated in many cities to widely carry out propaganda activities. In Wuhan and Zhanjiang City in Guangdong alone, over 290,000 people participated in activities during the propaganda week.
　　
　　In the demonstrations and parades in various places in Southwest China, over 1.5 million people participated. They belong to various ethnic groups, various strata, and have various different religious beliefs. Monks from Mount Emei, who live above the “snow line” year-round, and the Tibetan, Qiang, Yi, Hui, and other ethnic minorities in remote areas such as western Sichuan and northern Sichuan, have also joined the ranks of this patriotic movement.
　　
　　Before and after the parades, people from all walks of life in various places who had suffered from the atrocities of the Japanese invaders held rallies to denounce the atrocities of the Japanese invaders. Workers, residents, industrialists and businessmen, and suburban peasants in Chongqing held over fifty denunciation meetings. Over 20,000 women representatives from fourteen counties, including Wenjiang and Xinfan in western Sichuan, held a large denunciation meeting in Chengdu on the 9th. After recalling the crimes of the Japanese invaders and recognizing the evil conspiracy of American imperialism to support Japan, they became even more determined to resist America, aid Korea, and defend their homes and country. These meetings all passed declarations, telegrams, or protest letters against American arming of Japan. Many places sent telegrams to the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people, expressing their willingness to fight together with them for a comprehensive peace treaty.
　　
　　In the movement against American arming of Japan, the patriotic enthusiasm of the people in various places has continued to increase, and they have formulated patriotic pledges based on their own work situations. The workers have enthusiastically responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group, and many Ma Hengchang-style production groups have emerged in factories in Chongqing in February. Salt workers in Zigong City, southern Sichuan, launched a patriotic production competition in conjunction with the movement against American arming of Japan, which has already reduced salt production costs by 10%. The industrial and commercial circles in Chongqing held a tax payment parade against American rearmament of Japan and quickly completed the industrial and commercial taxes for January and February. Donations to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's Forces on the Korean front and to relieve Korean refugees have also increased dramatically. For example, donations from all walks of life in Chongqing have increased from 500 million yuan to over 900 million yuan.
　　
　　People from all walks of life in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Kangding in Xikang Province, as well as Tibetan people in Ba'an and Lihua counties, have held forums against American arming of Japan. The forum held by the Tibetan people in Kangding was attended by over 60 representatives from all walks of life in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, as well as Living Buddhas and Lamas. The meeting passed a telegram to the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people, expressing their support for their struggle for democratic and independent liberation. From March 4th to 10th, over 5,000 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Kangding held demonstrations and parades, and separately passed patriotic pledges. The people of the Tibetan Autonomous Region expressed their determination to defend peace by enthusiastically making donations. According to incomplete statistics, the people in the region have donated over 24 million yuan and have written over 3,000 consolation letters in Tibetan and Chinese to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in Korea, and to the People's Liberation Army advancing into Tibet. In addition, demonstrations and parades of over 10,000 people have also been held in the Xichang area, where many ethnic groups live together.
　　
　　The Lisu, Nu, Hui, and other ethnic groups in the vast area between Gaoligong Mountain and the Nujiang River in western Yunnan Province have been denouncing the bloody crimes of the Japanese invaders after they invaded the area in 1940. Ma Siwei and other Hui people in Tengchong angrily denounced: In Yingpan Street, Tengchong, Japanese devils steamed four people to death alive in steamers, and countless others were killed and buried alive. The Japanese robbers also dyed the local residents' most precious salt red with the blood of the killed before allowing the residents to eat it. The denouncers unanimously stated that the people of all ethnic groups will never forget this debt of blood, and will never allow American robbers to rearm the Japanese devils today to carry out aggression again.

　　中南西南百四十余市县和部分农村       
    展开反对美国武装日本运动       
    西康云南少数民族人民亦热烈参加
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：中南区、西南区各地人民反对美国武装日本的运动正不断扩展。据不完全统计，江西、河南、湖北、广东四省一百多个城市，西南三十七个市县和中南西南两区部分农村已举行了反对美国武装日本的示威游行。西康省及云南省西部的少数民族人民也参加了这个运动，有的地方举行了集会和游行示威，云南曾被日寇侵入的地方的少数民族人民则纷纷控诉日寇的血腥罪行。
    在中南，从“二七”纪念日到“三八”妇女节的一个月中，仅广东省即有三十多个城镇的人民举行了示威游行，有些农村也举行了游行。参加游行的各界人民共有五十多万人。河南省开封、郑州、周口、朱集和湖北省黄石等市的工人及其家属共约十三万人于三月十八日同天举行了示威游行。各地工人纷纷响应马恒昌小组的挑战，以生产竞赛的实际行动来表示热爱祖国、反对美国侵略的决心。
    在土地改革中翻了身的农民，也以蓬勃的热情投入这个爱国运动。武汉、江西赣州等市郊区和河南省许昌县，前后共有二十多万农民举行了示威游行。广东省揭阳县官硕乡一个曾遭日寇残酷破坏的村子，十几年来被称为“凄惨巷”；在土地改革中，这村的农民分进了土地、房屋及一部分粮食和农具，他们欢天喜地地把“凄惨巷”改为“翻身巷”。当他们听到美帝国主义重新武装日本的消息时，他们坚决地表示要加劲生产，组织民兵，决不能让“翻身巷”再回到“凄惨巷”的苦境。
    城市中的妇女、工商业者、宗教界人士以及其他各界人民都被卷入了反对美国武装日本的爱国热潮。在“三八”节这一天，广东省有二十四个城镇的十八万妇女举行了示威游行。各地工商业者普遍提出了“月税月清、履行爱国公约”的口号。武汉市工商界一百五十八个行业十四万余人在三月十八日举行了盛大的示威游行。在武汉、海口、南昌、南阳、临颍等地，宗教界人士都参加了示威游行。南阳市的天主教徒和基督教徒都说：教徒们不能只是祈祷和平，要积极行动起来，争取和平，保卫和平。
    为着使这一运动更普遍、更深入地发展，在许多城市中都规定了宣传周，广泛开展宣传活动。仅武汉市和广东湛江市，在宣传周内参加活动的就有二十九万多人。
    在西南各地的示威游行中，有一百五十多万人参加。他们属于各个民族、各个阶层，具有各种不同的宗教信仰。常年居住在“雪线”以上的峨眉山僧众和川西、川北等偏僻地区的藏、羌、彝、回等各少数民族人民，也都参加了这个爱国运动的行列。
    在游行前后，各地曾受日寇荼毒的各界人民纷纷举行集会，控诉日寇暴行。重庆市工人、居民、工商业者及郊区农民，共举行了五十多次控诉会；川西区温江、新繁等十四个县的妇女代表二万多人，于九日在成都开了一个大控诉会。人们在回忆了日寇的罪行、认清了美帝国主义扶植日本的罪恶阴谋以后，就更坚定了抗美援朝保家卫国的意志。这些集会都通过了反对美国武装日本的宣言、通电或抗议书。有不少地方的游行大会致电日本共产党和日本人民，表示愿与他们为争取缔结全面和约而共同斗争。
    在反对美国武装日本的运动中，各地人民的爱国热忱继续提高，他们纷纷根据自己的工作情况订出爱国公约。工人们热烈地响应马恒昌小组的挑战，重庆市各工厂在二月份内已出现很多马恒昌式的生产小组。川南自贡市盐工结合反对美国武装日本运动发起了爱国主义生产竞赛，已使制盐成本降低了百分之十。重庆市工商界曾举行了反对美国重新武装日本的纳税大游行，迅速完成了一、二月份的工商业税。各地慰劳朝鲜前线中朝人民部队及救济朝鲜难民的捐款也激剧增加。如重庆市各界人民捐款已由五亿元增加到九亿多元。
    西康省藏族自治区康定的藏族、回族各界人民和巴安、理化等县藏族人民均先后举行了反对美国武装日本的座谈会。康定藏族人民举行的座谈会，出席的有藏族自治区各界人民代表及活佛、喇嘛等六十余人。会上曾通过致电日本共产党及日本人民，表示声援他们争取民主独立的解放斗争。三月四日至十日，康定各族各界人民五千余人相继举行了示威游行，并分别通过了爱国公约。藏族自治区人民以踊跃捐献来表示他们保卫和平的决心。据不完全统计：该区人民已捐献二千四百余万元，并写了三千多封藏、汉文字的慰问信分寄给在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军及进军西藏的人民解放军。此外，在多种民族杂居的西昌地区也举行过一万多人的示威游行。
    云南省西部高黎贡山与怒江间广大地区的傈僳、怒子、回族等民族人民，纷纷控诉一九四零年日寇侵入该地后的血腥罪行。腾冲回民马思伟等愤怒地控诉说：在腾冲营盘街，日本鬼子曾把四个人用蒸笼活活蒸死，被杀死和活埋的更不计其数。日本强盗并将当地居民最宝贵的盐巴，用被杀者的鲜血染红，才允许居民食用。控诉者一致表示：各族人民永远不会忘记这笔血债，更不容许美国强盗在今天重新武装日本鬼子再来进行侵略。
