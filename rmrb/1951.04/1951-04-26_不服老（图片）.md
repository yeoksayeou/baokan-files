    Refusing to Accept Old Age
    By Guan Jian
    (4) The Japanese devils first invaded Korea, and then invaded Northeast China from Korea like a flood. They raped, burned, and killed everywhere. Those warlords and bureaucrats who usually rode roughshod over the common people all ran into the interior.

    (5) After the warlords and bureaucrats ran away, the landlords colluded with the Japanese devils to oppress the people. Old Man Li and his son Dachun worked for the landlord. They couldn't get enough to eat or wear all year round. The Japanese devils also wanted to抓劳工 (zhua laogong - seize laborers) and抓壮丁 (zhua zhuangding - seize strong men). ... At that time, Old Man Li made up his mind to let his only son join the Anti-Japanese United Army.

    (6) In the deep winter of 1942, the Anti-Japanese United Army fought a battle with the Japanese devils on a hillside. Dachun was seriously wounded and lay in the snow, unable to get up. Just as he was getting anxious, Li Hongguang's troops (a unit of the Anti-Japanese United Army composed of Korean people) suddenly appeared on the hilltop. They bravely defeated the Japanese devils and rescued him.

    （四）日本鬼子也是先侵略了朝鲜，然后从朝鲜像洪水猛兽般地侵略到东北来。它们到处奸淫烧杀。那些平时骑在老百姓头上作威作福的军阀、官僚们都跑进关里去了。
    （五）军阀、官僚都跑了，地主们又和日本鬼子勾结起来欺压人民。李老头和儿子大春，给地主扛活。整年吃不饱，穿不暖。日本鬼子又要抓劳工，抓壮西。……当时，李老头下了决心，叫独生子参加了抗日联军。
    （六）一九四二年的深冬，抗日联军和日本鬼子在一个山坡上，打了一仗。大春负了重伤，躺在雪地里，爬不起来。正在着急，山头上忽然出现李红光的队伍（抗日联军中朝鲜人民组成的部队）。他们勇敢地击溃了日本鬼子，把他救起来。
