I Denounced My Grandfather
    (Narrated by Feng Shaoqian, Recorded by Sun Dehua)
    My grandfather's name is Feng Jinxiu. He is from Feng Village, Ba County, Hebei Province. In the past, he was the head of the Futong branch of the Miaofeng Mountain Buddhist Longhua Society. During the enemy and puppet regime, he colluded with Okamura Neji, a ruthless executioner, and the big traitor Wang Yitang. After the victory, he also had connections with Kuomintang secret service chiefs Hao Yulin and Chen Xianzhou. Wang Ziquan, the head of the "World New Buddhist Church," who had been executed, also had close ties with him. Wang Ziquan used exploitation and deception to get money and bought a large jar of opium paste, which he dug out piece by piece to smoke. He preached to his followers: "Wang Ziquan is a true immortal descended to earth, who disappears in the blink of an eye once he steps out." In our home, there is also a "Good Man Plaque" written by Okamura Neji for my grandfather. He used superstition to cruelly exploit the people of Ba County. He had an egg-sized lump on his forehead, calling himself "Old Buddha." He said to the followers he had deceived: "This big lump is a blessing. Why can't others grow it? There will be a great disaster in the future. Those who follow me into the faith will survive, but those who don't will surely die!" Fifteen years ago, he was sucking the blood of the people in Ba County. I was still young then, and I don't remember the details very well. Some people went bankrupt in order to believe in the faith, and they had to sell their children to pay money to this "living Buddha." Entering his religious sect meant entering a bottomless abyss, a boundless pit of fire. But he slowly grew fat, bought houses, and bought land. In the year of the "July 7th Incident," I was six years old. The people in the countryside generally demanded resistance against Japan. He was afraid, so he sold his house and land and came to Tianjin, colluding with the heads of reactionary secret societies in Tianjin. He sent his underlings to bring the money he had exploited from the followers in his hometown in bicycle tires for him to squander. Then, he opened several big businesses and made a fortune. When I was a child, I didn't know that my grandfather's hands were stained with blood. I didn't know that my grandfather was such a vicious and shameless person. I spent blood-stained money, and I regret it terribly!
    He not only harmed others, but also killed my mother:
    My mother did not believe in my grandfather's faith. She saw through the deeds that my grandfather was doing. My grandfather knew that my mother opposed him, said that my mother had violated "family rules," bought a dog whip used by the Japanese, stared at my father, and forced my father to whip my mother with tears in his eyes, listening to my mother's painful cries.
    My mother's life in my grandfather's hands was like rolling on a mountain of knives. My mother died in this way at the hands of my grandfather—a villain. Nine years ago, I became a motherless child. This is a blood debt, I cannot forget, I must demand it from him!
    He tried to use various methods to deceive the people. But I exposed their shameless tricks. I resolutely resisted and stood against them, becoming a thorn in their side.
    When I joined the Youth League in 1949, my grandfather tried to stop me and intimidate me, but I was not intimidated. When I joined the army, he tried to use the same old tricks. But his conspiracy was shattered again.
    Grandfather is also a skilled rumor-monger. He colluded with Wang Ziquan to promote him, and he said to the followers: "'The Great Way is clear,' don't 'blindly believe' in the Communist Party."
    The day after the news of the cracking of the "World New Buddhist Church" counter-revolutionary organization was announced, I knew that my grandfather was a complete villain. I hated him. No one can forgive him. At two o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the Hailar Road Police Station in District One to denounce him. After three or four days, my grandfather was arrested. I was so happy that I didn't know what to say. I hope the government will execute him quickly to avenge the old folks in Ba County, avenge my mother, and eliminate the harm for the people. Soon, he was released again, and my heart turned cold.
    But the eyes of the people cannot tolerate a grain of sand. During this period of severe suppression of counter-revolutionaries, he was arrested again. The government escorted him to Ba County, where a public trial meeting will be held.
    I want to ask the leadership for leave to attend this meeting. I want to accuse him of his crimes. I will not allow the enemy of the people to live. I love my country. I love this happy and beautiful life. I cannot let people like my grandfather destroy it. I want to see him fall before the people with my own eyes!

　　我检举了爷爷
    （冯绍谦述  孙德骅记）
    我爷爷叫冯锦修，河北省霸县冯村人，过去是妙峰山佛教龙华会福通盘盘主。敌伪统治时，勾结杀人不眨眼的刽子手——冈村宁次和大汉奸王揖唐。胜利后又和国民党的特务头子郝遇林、陈仙州等有了联系。已被枪决的“世界新佛教会”头子王紫泉，跟他的关系也很密切。王紫泉用剥削欺骗的手段骗来的钱买了一大缸大烟膏子，他就一块块地挖来抽。他向道徒们宣传说：“王紫泉是真仙下界，一出门转眼就没影了。”在我们家里，还有冈村宁次给我爷爷写的“善人匾”。他就用迷信来残酷地剥削着霸县的人民。他脑门上长了一个鸡蛋般的大疙疸，自称“老佛爷”，他对被骗入道的道徒说：“这个大疙疸就是福，怎么别人长不上？将来要有大难，跟着我入道的就能活，不入道准死不能赦！”十五年前，他就在霸县吸着人民的血，那时我还小，详细的事情记不太清楚了，有的为了信道倾家荡产，为了给他这个“活佛”交钱就得卖儿卖女。入了他的道门儿就走进了无底的深渊，无边的火坑。而他却慢慢胖了起来，买了房子，买了地。“七七”事变那年，我六岁，乡村人民普遍的要求抗日，他害怕，卖了房地来到天津，勾结着天津的反动会道门的头子。他打发手底下的小头子把从家乡道徒们那里剥削来的钱用自行车带装来，供他挥霍。接着，他开了好几个大买卖发了横财。我小时候，不知道爷爷的双手沾满了血，不知道爷爷是这样毒辣无耻的人，我花过带血的钞票，我后悔死了！
    他不但害别人，还害死了我母亲：
    我母亲不信爷爷的道，她看清了爷爷干的勾当，爷爷知道了我母亲反对他，说我母亲犯了“家规”，买来鬼子打狗的皮鞭，他瞪着眼，逼我父亲含着眼泪，抽打母亲，听着母亲痛苦地呼叫。
    母亲在爷爷手里过日子像滚刀山，母亲就这样屈死在我爷爷——恶棍手里。九年前，我就成了没娘的孩子，这是血债，我不能忘记，我要向他讨还！
    他想用各种方法来欺骗人民。但我揭穿了他们无耻的诡计，我坚决地反抗，和他们对立起来，成了他们的眼中钉。
    一九四九年我入团时，爷爷阻止我，恫吓我，我没被吓倒。我参军时，他又想施用故技。但阴谋又被我粉碎了。
    爷爷又是个造谣的能手，他勾结着王紫泉，替他宣传，他对道徒说：“‘大道已明’，别‘胡信’共产党。”
    破获“世界新佛教会”反革命组织的消息公布的第二天，我知道了爷爷是个彻头彻尾的大坏蛋，我恨他，谁也不能饶恕他，下午两点多钟，我到一区海拉尔道派出所去检举他。过了三、四天，爷爷被抓走了，我心里高兴得真不知说什么好，我希望政府赶快把他枪毙了，给霸县的老乡们报仇，给我妈妈报仇，给人民除害。不久，他又被放了出来，我心里凉了。
    但人民的眼睛里不能进一粒沙子，这次严厉镇压反革命期间，他又被逮捕了，政府把他押到霸县，将要在那里开一个群众公审大会。
    我要向上级请假，参加这个会，我要控诉他的罪恶，我不准许人民公敌活着，我爱我的祖国，我爱这幸福美丽的生活，我不能让爷爷这样的人来破坏，我要亲眼看着他在人民面前倒下去！
