　　[This Newspaper News] The vast urban and rural populations in North China, Northwest China, and Central and South China are tensely carrying out preparations for the "May Day" grand demonstration.
　　In North China, in addition to more than 400 small and medium-sized cities that will hold separate demonstrations and parades, 80,000 rural villages will also hold joint township parades by district or sub-district. Farmers and workers everywhere are rushing to make various slogan signs for the parade. The broad masses of rural women, especially young women in the cotton-producing areas of Hebei and Pingyuan provinces, are sewing spring clothes and steaming and baking dry food day and night, preparing to participate in the grand event.
　　Before mid-April, the anti-US and aid-Korea movement leading organs at all levels in North China had generally formulated publicity work plans and trained millions of cadres and activists to carry out publicity work. Shanxi and Chahar provinces each organized 70,000 cadres, teachers, and students above the district level to go to the countryside for publicity. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China gave short-term current affairs education to 1.4 million Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, taking them as the backbone of publicity.
　　In Northwest China, the preparations of people of all ethnic groups to welcome the "May Day" grand demonstration have been completed. Xi'an City has formed a parade contingent of approximately 400,000 people, accounting for 70% of the city's population. It is estimated that more than 7 million farmers in rural areas of Shaanxi Province will participate in the "May Day" demonstration parade, accounting for more than 60% of the province's population. Lanzhou City will have 100,000 people holding demonstrations and parades. In Tianshui Prefecture, 500,000 Hui and Han people have been organized to prepare for the parade. Various places in Ningxia Province are also actively preparing for the parade.
　　By mid-April, all counties in Qinghai had successively established "May Day" demonstration parade preparation committees. At that time, demonstrations and parades will be held in all cities, towns, villages, and monasteries throughout the province. People of all ethnic groups in small and medium-sized cities such as Dihua, Yili, Hami, and Kashgar in Xinjiang Province are actively carrying out the organizational work for the demonstration parade. After propaganda and organizational work among the masses in various cities and towns in southern Xinjiang through song and dance troupes, it is expected that people of all ethnic groups will participate in the demonstration parade with singing and dancing. In pastoral areas such as Nanshan, herdsmen hold small seminars to discuss the rationale of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea.
　　All parts of Central and South China are actively preparing to welcome the "May Day" grand demonstration. The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Jiangxi Branch of the Anti-US and Aid-Korea Association plan to fully mobilize the broad masses of people to participate in the "May Day" parade and demonstration, and strive for 10 million people in the province to participate in signing in support of the conclusion of a peace pact and voting on the Japanese issue. The Yuxian County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Henan Province plans to organize 450,000 people from all walks of life to participate in the "May Day" grand demonstration. More than 20 counties including Xiangxi Administrative Office, Xiangtan, Yueyang, and Pingjiang in Hunan Province have successively held representatives' meetings from all walks of life or anti-US and aid-Korea representatives' meetings, and have formulated specific publicity plans. Under the leadership of the District Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, all Party and government organs and mass organizations in Hainan Island will hold a grand demonstration movement for the "May Day" festival and the anniversary of the island's liberation from April 23 (the anniversary of the liberation of Hainan Island) to "May Day". The Guangzhou Branch of the Anti-US and Aid-Korea Association hired 107 lecturers, mobilized more than 30,000 teachers and students from schools throughout the city, and has formed a propaganda team to carry out anti-US and aid-Korea propaganda and education in order to thoroughly eliminate "blank spots" in the city. Guarantee that more than 500,000 people will participate in the demonstration on "May Day" and understand the significance of holding the demonstration.
