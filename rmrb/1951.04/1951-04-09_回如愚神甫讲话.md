Father Hui Ru-yu's Speech

Respected leaders, distinguished guests:

　　Today marks the founding of the Chinese Catholic Church Reform Movement Promotion Association, an unprecedented feat in the Chinese Catholic Church. We, the vast people of China, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, have stood up. We must no longer be oppressed by imperialist elements. We Chinese people should love our motherland. However, imperialist elements, using religion as a cover, engage in espionage and aggression activities that endanger our motherland, and consistently employ oppressive and deceptive tactics within the church. For example, the case of the French imperialist occupation of the Old Xikai in the fifth year of the Republic of China was under the pretext of protecting the church to seize Chinese territory. At the same time, imperialist elements within the church also abused their divine authority to aid this act of aggression. The facts are all there and cannot be denied! This is a great shame for our Chinese Catholic Church! They have deceived and misled us, the Chinese believers. They are all demons in sheep's clothing with the hearts of wolves! They have distorted the doctrines, spread poison, paralyzed Chinese believers, and infringed upon the interests of the Chinese people! This is intolerable to us, the Chinese people and Chinese Catholics. If we Catholics do not thoroughly eliminate them, we not only cannot be called good sons and daughters of China, but also cannot be called good believers of God. On the contrary, we are criminals of betraying the country and betraying the church! Therefore, we Catholics should faithfully support the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement and demonstrate our determination to oppose imperialism, love the country, and love the church with practical actions.

　　Today, our Catholic Church Reform Movement Promotion Association is officially established. We are extremely grateful for the guidance from the government and all the leaders present. Now, on behalf of all the clergy and all the Catholics in Tianjin, I extend our highest respect to the great Chairman Mao and Mayor Huang Jing!

　　回如愚神甫讲话诸位首长，诸位来宾：
    今天，是我们天主教革新运动促进会成立的日子，在中国天主教会里，这是一件空前的壮举。我们中国广大的人民，在毛主席的英明领导下，已经站起来了。我们决不能再受帝国主义分子的压迫了。我们中国人民，应当爱护我们自己的祖国。但帝国主义分子，利用宗教做掩护，进行危害我们祖国的间谍、侵略活动，并且一贯的在教会内施行欺压、哄骗的手段。如民国五年法帝国主义侵占老西开案，就是以保护教堂为名，霸占了中国的领土。同时教会内帝国主义分子，也滥用神权来帮助这侵略行为，事实俱在，不容讳言！这是我们中国天主教会莫大的耻辱！他们蒙蔽、欺骗了我们中国信徒。他们都是外披羊皮，内怀狼心的恶魔！他们歪曲了教义，散布毒素，麻痹中国信徒，侵害中国人民的利益！这是我们中国人民、中国教友所不能容忍的。我们天主教徒若不彻底除掉他们，不但称不起中国的好儿女，也称不起天主的好信徒。相反的，是叛国叛教的罪犯！所以我们天主教徒们应当忠诚的拥护三自革新运动，并以实际行动，表现我们反帝爱国、爱教的决心。
    今天我们天主教革新运动促进会正式成立，蒙政府和各位首长光临指导，我们是十二分的感激。现在我谨代表我们天津市全体神职班和全体教友们，向伟大的毛主席、黄敬市长，致以崇高的敬礼！
