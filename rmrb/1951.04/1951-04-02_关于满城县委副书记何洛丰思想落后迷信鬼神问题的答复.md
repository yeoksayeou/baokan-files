Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editor:

On August 4th of last year, the People's Daily published a reader's letter criticizing me for "backward thinking and superstitious beliefs in ghosts and gods." I am now sending my self-criticism.

First, I must criticize myself for not making a timely self-criticism after the Party newspaper published the criticism of me, despite repeated urging from the prefectural committee. At that time, because part of the criticism in the newspaper was inconsistent with the facts, I could not accept it, and I adopted an attitude of ignoring it. After a long period of inner struggle and with the help of other comrades, I have realized that this attitude is wrong. I should accept the correct parts of the criticism; and make factual corrections to the inaccurate parts.

The reader's criticism that I was superstitious in ghosts and gods, although the details differed somewhat from the facts, was basically correct. Although I did not personally invite a geomancer to see my wife, I did not stop it, and adopted an attitude of indifference. This reflects the remnants of feudal superstitious thinking in my mind.

Regarding the issue of selling land, the number of mu of land mentioned in the "Reader's Letter" is incorrect. At that time, because there were five people in my family and no labor force, and our life was indeed difficult, I sold five mu of land that had been distributed from the landlord in Xigou Village. This incident had a bad influence among the masses.

The "Reader's Letter" said that I took two or three pieces from each of the forty-six piles of clothing seized during struggle and pocketed them for myself. This is not true and should be corrected.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    关于满城县委副书记何洛丰思想落后迷信鬼神问题的答复编辑同志：
    去年八月四日，人民日报刊登了批评我“思想落后，迷信鬼神”的读者信件。今将我的检讨寄上。
    首先，我应当检讨的是：党报刊登了对我的批评后，经地委屡次督促，我仍没有及时进行检讨。当时我因为报纸上的批评有一部分与事实不符，接受不了，就采取了置之不理的态度。经过我长时间的内心斗争与其他同志对我的帮助，我已经认识到这种态度是错误的。我应当接受批评的正确部分；对失实的部分，则应作实事求是的更正。
    读者批评我迷信鬼神，所谈情况与事实虽有些出入，但基本上是正确的。虽然当时我自己没有去请阴阳先生来给我妻看病，但是，我却没有制止，而采取了不管的态度。这也就反映了在我的思想中还存在着封建迷信思想的残余。
    关于出卖土地的问题，《读者来信》中所说的土地亩数是不对的。当时我因家中五口人，没有劳动力，生活确实困难，便将分得西苟村地主的土地五亩出卖了。这件事在群众中的影响是不好的。
    《读者来信》说：我从斗争果实四十六堆衣服中间，每堆抽出二、三件私吞了，这不是事实，请更正。
