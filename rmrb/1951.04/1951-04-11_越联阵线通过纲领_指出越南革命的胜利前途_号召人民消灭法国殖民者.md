　　Xinhua News Agency, 10th: According to Vietnam News Agency on the 6th, the National Congress convened to merge Viet Minh and Viet Lien passed the program of the Vietnam National United Front (Viet Lien Front) in early March. The program is divided into three chapters. The first chapter of the program analyzes the overall international situation, and the program declares: The Vietnamese people firmly stand on the side of the peace and democracy camp.
    The second chapter of the program analyzes the current situation in Vietnam, saying: The liberation war waged by the Vietnamese people under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh has shifted from the defensive to the offensive. Although the French colonialists have American aid, they have retreated from the offensive to the defensive. The recent merger of Viet Minh and Viet Lien into the Viet Lien Front has further consolidated the Vietnamese national united front and guaranteed the victory of the Vietnamese resistance. The increase in American imperialist aid to the French colonialists may cause more difficulties for Vietnam's resistance, but final victory will certainly belong to the Vietnamese people.
    The third chapter of the program points out that the revolutionary tasks of the Vietnamese people at this stage are: to eliminate the French colonialists, defeat the American interventionists, and punish the traitors; to consolidate and develop the people's democratic regime; to build an independent, united, democratic, free and prosperous Vietnam; and to jointly safeguard lasting peace with the people of all countries in the world.
    The program also stipulates twelve specific policies for implementing armed resistance and carrying out national construction. The program stipulates that the Viet Lien Front must unite all patriotic groups and individuals, regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, or class, to form a solid national alliance as the foundation of the people's democratic state, and strive to complete the Vietnamese people's revolution.

　　越联阵线通过纲领
  　指出越南革命的胜利前途
  　号召人民消灭法国殖民者
    【新华社十日讯】据越南通讯社六日讯：为合并越盟和越联而召开的全国代表大会，于三月初通过了越南民族联合阵线（越联阵线）的纲领。纲领共分三章。纲领第一章分析了整个国际形势，纲领宣称：越南人民坚决地站在和平民主阵营方面。
    纲领第二章分析越南目前的形势说：越南人民在胡志明主席领导下进行的解放战争，已从守势转入攻势。法国殖民者虽有美国援助，但已从攻势退到守势。最近越盟和越联合并为越联阵线，更加巩固了越南民族统一阵线，并保证了越南抗战的胜利。美帝国主义增加对法国殖民者的援助，也许会使越南的抗战遇到更多的困难，但最后胜利一定属于越南人民。
    纲领的第三章指出现阶段越南人民的革命任务是：消灭法国殖民者，击败美国干涉者，惩办卖国贼；巩固和发展人民民主政权；建设一个独立、团结、民主、自由和繁荣的越南；并和世界各国人民共同维护持久和平。
    纲领并规定了为贯彻武装抗战和进行国家建设的十二项具体政策。纲领规定越联阵线必须不分性别、民族、宗教和阶级，团结一切爱国团体和人士，结成一个巩固的全国的联盟，作为人民民主国家的基础，为完成越南人民的革命而奋斗。
