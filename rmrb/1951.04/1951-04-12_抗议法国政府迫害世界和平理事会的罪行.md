　　Protest Against the French Government's Crimes of Persecuting the World Peace Council

　　The French government, violating the will of the French people, unreasonably ordered the banning of the World Peace Council from operating within French territory on the 9th of this month. This reactionary measure by the French government is a shameless attack and sabotage of the world movement to defend peace, and once again proves that it is willing to follow the war policies of American imperialism and is an enemy of the world's peace cause. Because the activities of the World Peace Council aim to safeguard human peace and security and strive for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact. Only those who hate peace will hate this world peace organization. The Chinese people, who love peace and are continuing to deepen and popularize the great struggle to resist America and aid Korea in order to defend world peace and respond to the resolutions of the World Peace Council, resolutely protest this tyrannical and reactionary measure by the French government.

　　The French reactionary government's unreasonable persecution of the World Peace Council is absolutely intolerable to peace-loving people all over the world. The World Peace Council is an organization for peace-loving people all over the world to strive for and defend world peace. It is composed of representatives of the people from sixty-five countries, elected by representatives of hundreds of millions of people from eighty countries around the world at the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw last November. It represents the peace-loving aspirations of the people of the world and is the headquarters for defending world peace. Therefore, the French government's unreasonable persecution of the World Peace Council is an infringement on the peaceful aspirations of peace-loving people all over the world and is bound to arouse the anger and opposition of peace-loving people all over the world.

　　This shameful act of the French government was obviously carried out under the instructions of its American masters. It is well known that the French government follows the will of the American aggressors, frantically carries out arms expansion and war preparations, intensifies its attacks on the Vietnamese people, and betrays the interests of the French people by signing the Schuman Plan treaty and agreeing to the crime of the United States arming West Germany. In January of this year, while the then French Prime Minister Pleven went to the United States to conduct a traitorous meeting with Truman, the French government issued a reactionary order based on decrees signed by the likes of Daladier and Pétain in 1939 and 1940, unreasonably prohibiting the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth and other three major international democratic organizations from operating in France. Now, precisely when French President Auriol's Wall Street masters in the United States expressed the French government's attitude of obedient servitude to the American war preparation and aggression policies, the French government, again based on the same shameful decrees, unreasonably banned the World Peace Council from operating in France. These facts fully prove that the French government is a shameful tool of its American masters. It has accepted the orders of the United States to undermine the world movement to defend peace.

　　This practice of American and French imperialism once again exposes their sinister attempts to disregard the opposition of peace-loving people around the world, to frantically prepare for war, and to prepare to launch a new world war. At the same time, it also fully demonstrates their fear of the increasingly vigorous world movement to defend peace, and their own weakness and isolation. Since the World Peace Council held its first meeting in Berlin in February of this year, the world movement to defend peace has been developed more widely and deeply. In order to respond to and implement the declaration and various resolutions of the first session of the World Peace Council, the people of various countries have generally launched extensive activities to defend peace. In Asia, the movement of the people of various countries, including the Japanese people, against the rearmament of Japan by the United States is developing vigorously; in Europe, the movement of the people of various countries, including the people of West Germany, against the arming of West Germany by the United States has also entered an unprecedented climax; in Eurasia and other parts of the world, the signature movement in support of the conclusion of a peace pact is attracting millions of new peace fighters to stand in the ranks of defending peace. This great struggle to defend peace on a world scale has seriously hit the war-mongers' war preparations and conspiracies to launch a new war, making American imperialists and their vassals tremble with fear. Therefore, they have adopted this tyrannical measure of banning the activities of the World Peace Council, attempting to destroy the world people's movement to defend peace. However, peace lives in the hearts of the people, and the worldwide activities to defend peace can never be banned by a mere reactionary order. The angered peace-loving people all over the world will unite more closely around the World Peace Council, intensify the struggle to defend peace, fight back against the provocations of the imperialist warmongers, and completely shatter the imperialists' conspiracy to launch a new war.

### 抗议法国政府迫害世界和平理事会的罪行

　　抗议法国政府迫害世界和平理事会的罪行
    法国政府违背法国人民的意志，于本月九日无理地下令禁止世界和平理事会在法国境内活动。法国政府的这个反动措施，是对世界保卫和平运动的无耻进攻与破坏，再次证明了它甘心追随美国帝国主义的战争政策，与世界和平事业为敌。因为世界和平理事会的活动，目的是在维护人类的和平和安全，争取缔结五大国和平公约。只有仇视和平，才会仇视这个世界和平机构。热爱和平，并为保卫世界和平、响应世界和平理事会决议而继续深入普及抗美援朝伟大斗争的中国人民，坚决抗议法国政府这一横暴的反动的措施。
    法国反动政府对世界和平理事会的无理迫害，是全世界爱好和平的人民所绝不能容忍的。世界和平理事会是全世界爱好和平人民争取并保卫世界和平的组织。它是世界上八十个国家的亿万人民代表，在去年十一月华沙二届世界保卫和平大会上选举出来的六十五个国家的人民代表所组成的。它代表了世界人民热爱和平的意愿，是保卫世界和平的司令部。因此，法国政府对世界和平理事会的无理迫害，也就是对全世界爱好和平人民的和平意愿的侵犯，是必然要引起全世界爱好和平人民的愤怒与反对的。
    法国政府的这一可耻行为，显然是在它的美国主子的指使下进行的。法国政府遵从美国侵略者的意旨，疯狂进行扩军备战，加紧进攻越南人民，并出卖法国人民利益签订舒曼计划条约，同意美国武装西德的罪行已是人所共知的了。今年一月间，在当时的法国政府总理普利文赴美与杜鲁门进行卖身投靠会谈的同时，法国政府就曾根据一九三九年和一九四○年由达拉第和贝当之流所签署的法令，发布反动命令，无理禁止世界工会联合会、国际民主妇女联合会、世界民主青年联盟等三大国际民主团体在法国境内活动。如今，也正是法国总统阿里奥尔在美国华尔街的主子们表示了法国政府对美国备战侵略政策忠顺的奴婢态度时，法国政府又根据了同样可耻的法令，无理禁止世界和平理事会在法国境内活动。这些事实，充分地证明了法国政府是它的美国主子的可耻的工具。它是接受了美国的命令，来破坏世界保卫和平运动的。
    美法帝国主义的这种做法，再一次暴露了它们不顾世界爱好和平人民的反对，进行疯狂备战，准备发动新的世界战争的罪恶企图。同时，也充分表示了它们对日益蓬勃发展的世界保卫和平运动的恐惧，和它们自己的虚弱与孤立。世界保卫和平运动，自世界和平理事会于今年二月间在柏林举行第一届会议以来，已得到了更为广泛与深入的发展。各国人民为响应与执行世界和平理事会第一届会议的宣言与各项决议，已普遍展开保卫和平的广泛活动。在亚洲，包括日本人民在内的各国人民反对美国重新武装日本的运动，正在蓬勃发展；在欧洲，包括西德人民在内的各国人民反对美国武装西德的运动，也已进入了前所未有的高潮；在欧亚两洲及世界其他各处，拥护缔结和平公约的签名运动，正在吸引着千千万万新的和平战士站到保卫和平的行列中来。这种世界规模的保卫和平的伟大斗争，严重地打击了战争贩子的备战活动与发动新战争阴谋，使得美帝国主义者及其附庸胆战心惊。于是它们便采取了这种禁止世界和平理事会活动的横暴措施，企图借以摧残世界人民保卫和平的运动。但是和平活在人心，全世界保卫和平的活动，决不是一纸反动命令所能取缔得了的。被触怒了的全世界爱好和平的人民，将更加紧密地团结在世界和平理事会的周围，加紧保卫和平的斗争，以还击帝国主义战争贩子的挑衅，使帝国主义发动新战争的阴谋彻底破产。
