[Reported by this newspaper] The Tianjin Public Security Bureau, accepting the just demands of all faculty, students, and patriotic Catholics of Tianjin University, has arrested and brought to justice three American imperialist spy elements hidden in the university who used religion as a cover for counter-revolutionary activities: Bu Xiangxian (Bonningue Alf, French national), Bao Yihua (also known as Bao Anliang, Pollet Henrieus, French national), and Fang Ruhui (Watine Ludov, French national). A U.S. military radio receiver and disassembled transmitting vacuum tube equipment were seized.

Bu Xiangxian and the other two criminals are loyal servants of American imperialism who have consistently engaged in anti-people activities. Bu was the "President" of the Tianjin branch of the Catholic Jesuit Order, and Bao and Fang were also "priests" in the Catholic Church. They wore the cloak of religion but engaged in espionage. In October 1947, our Jizhong People's Public Security Bureau cracked an international espionage case in Xian County, and Bu Xiangxian and others were among the fugitives in that case. At that time, under the direct leadership of bandit Shang Jianxun (the main culprit in the Xian County case), Bu Xiangxian and others secretly set up a radio station at the Institute of Industry and Commerce (now Tianjin University) with fugitive Deng Huidai (also a French reactionary priest) and others, to receive, send, and forward intelligence for the Xian County spy agency, and to supply intelligence personnel such as Motte of the American spy organization "U.S. Army Strategic Intelligence Unit" (S·S·U·) and international spy ringleader R.Lei. In September 1945, Bu Xiangxian was sent by Shang Jianxun to Tianjin to contact the Third Marine Division of the U.S. Marine Corps. Bu personally took a military aircraft sent by "Brigadier General" W.A. Worton of the division, and flew from Tianjin to Xian County to wreak havoc in the air, attempting to intimidate the local people who were carrying out land reform. Fang Ruhui served as the translator when the main criminals in the Xian County case contacted the U.S. military command in Tianjin. They also contacted the pseudo-garrison command through Liu Nairen (former president of Tianjin University) one of the Kuomintang secret service heads, made blacklists, and arbitrarily arrested progressive students and dismissed progressive professors. In short, before liberation, the Institute of Industry and Commerce was one of the bases for American espionage activities in Tianjin.

After liberation, the reactionary activities of these criminals remained unchanged, and even intensified. They used the reactionary organization "Legion of Mary" (also known as "Crusade of Our Lady", "Anti-Communist Crusade") in the church as a tool for counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, secretly gathering at 234 Zhennan Road (the former site of the Tianjin spy agency O.S.S. of the United States) every Friday night to discuss how to deal with various patriotic actions, acting as an echo for American imperialism. At that time, Bu Xiangxian served as the vice-president of the university, Bao Yihua served as the dean of the Engineering School, and Fang Ruhui served as the dean of the Business School. Taking advantage of their positions, when they visited factories with students, they inquired in detail about production conditions and production plans, and instructed trusted religious believers to infiltrate factories and government agencies in an attempt to gather intelligence. They constantly investigated the situation of our Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in the university, incited students to join the "Anti-Communist Guerrilla," and spread reactionary remarks. After the outbreak of the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea, they openly created rumors, touting "World War III" for American imperialism, and spreading shameless rumors. Last November, they even held secret meetings to discuss "how to deal with the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement"; Bu Xiangxian personally wrote reactionary pamphlets such as "The Atomic Bomb and the Cosmic Spirit" and "Austin," and distributed them publicly. They also often showed American reactionary films and organized students to listen to the "Voice of America" to carry out reactionary propaganda for American imperialism. Some patriotic religious believers in the university asked to join military cadre schools, but they threatened them, saying, "Joining a military cadre school is helping the devil, you are committing a crime." At the same time, Bu Xiangxian and others constantly slandered the new society, openly instructed religious believers "not to respond to the call of the People's Government," and prevented religious believers from approaching our Party members, Youth League members, and progressive students. When faculty, students and staff held various patriotic rallies they mobilized believers to go home. In addition, the criminals consistently resisted the educational policies of the People's Government. In January of this year, in order to safeguard the educational sovereignty of the Chinese people, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government accepted the demands of the faculty and students of the university and removed Bu Xiangxian from his post. However, the criminals took the leniency of the People's Government as a sign of weakness. Bu pretended to be ill in the hospital and continued to direct reactionary activities, deciding on a so-called "three-year plan" and asking believers to pray for his "safety." He also said to the believers, "It's not easy to deal with them (referring to the People's Government)." Bao and Fang were still not honest in the university. When patriotic religious believers in the university supported the self-reliance and reform movement and started signing, they abused "divine power," saying they were "apostates," and stopping them from "holding holy ceremonies" and "receiving sacraments." Bao Yihua openly said to Professors Fan Enkun and Wu Jiansheng (members of the Tianjin Catholic Self-Reliance and Reform Movement Promotion Association), "You have committed a crime, you will regret it." They used various despicable and shameless means to obstruct and sabotage this movement.

The criminal's destructive activities are too numerous to mention. Since the beginning of this year, faculty, students, and patriotic religious believers of Tianjin University have held continuous meetings, constantly accusing the criminals of their reactionary crimes, and unanimously demanding that the People's Government arrest them and bring them to justice. The Tianjin Public Security Bureau has also received many letters demanding the punishment of the criminals. Based on the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries", the Tianjin Public Security Bureau recently arrested the criminals in one fell swoop, and will prosecute them according to law and punish them.

[Another News] American imperialist spy elements lurking in Tianjin University to carry out counter-revolutionary activities also include Deng Huidai (also known as Vde Denis), Ke Shouyi (Petrus Klok), Di Shouren (Eduaurdus, Pctit), and Liu Nairen (Kuomintang secret agent). They were also all fugitives in the Xian County espionage case before liberation, colluding with the American Chiang Kai-shek gang and working together to engage in anti-people activities. After liberation, under the power and intimidation of our vast people and public security organs, they fled in fear of punishment.

[Reported by this newspaper] On the afternoon of the 2nd, more than 700 faculty, students, and staff of Tianjin University held an anti-imperialist patriotic accusation meeting. At the meeting, Catholic professor Miao Zhongyi and more than 20 students, including Gao Shukai, bitterly accused international spies Bu Xiangxian and others of their crimes, and expressed anger at being deceived by them in the past. During the accusation, slogans such as "Long live the unity of Tianjin University students!" and "Thoroughly eliminate imperialist elements in the university!" constantly erupted from the audience. Wu Jiansheng, representative of the Catholic Self-Reliance and Reform Promotion Association, and Wang Jinding, academic director of the university, both spoke at the meeting, calling on the faculty and students of Tianjin University to unite and thoroughly eliminate imperialist elements in the university. Finally, a resolution was passed demanding that the government severely punish American spies. (Attached picture)

　  天津逮捕三个美国间谍
　  卜相贤等三犯以宗教为掩护一贯进行反动活动
　  津沽大学师生员工举行控诉大会要求予以严惩
    【本报讯】天津市人民政府公安局接受津沽大学全体师生和爱国天主教徒的正义要求，将隐藏在该校、以宗教为掩护进行反革命活动的美帝国主义间谍分子卜相贤（Bonningue Alf，法藉）、鲍翊华（又名鲍安良，Pollet Henrieus，法籍）、房如晦（Watine Ludov，法籍）三犯逮捕归案，查获美国军用收报机一架及拆散的发射性真空管器材等一部。
    卜相贤等三犯，都是一贯进行反人民活动的美帝国主义的忠实奴仆。卜犯是天主教耶稣会天津院的“院长”，鲍、房两犯亦为天主教中的“神甫”。他们披着宗教的外衣，干的却是间谍勾当。一九四七年十月间，我冀中人民公安机关在献县破获了国际间谍案，卜相贤等就是其中在逃案犯的一部分。当时，卜相贤等在尚匪建勋（献县案主犯）的直接领导下，在工商学院（即现津沽大学）与逃犯邓惠达（也系法籍反动神甫）等秘密架设电台，为献县间谍机关收发转送情报，供给美国间谍组织“美国陆军战略情报处”（S·S·U·）的情报人员毛德（Motte）及国际间谍头子雷振远（R.Lei）等。一九四五年九月间，卜相贤被尚建勋派来天津与美国海军陆战队第三海陆师团联系，卜犯亲乘该师团“准将”瓦顿（W.A.Worton）所派的军用飞机，由天津飞往献县上空肆虐，企图恫吓正在进行土地改革的当地人民。献县案各主要罪犯与天津市美军司令部联系时，都由房如晦担任翻译。他们还通过国民党特务头子之一刘乃仁（解放前津沽大学校长）与伪警备司令部连系，开黑名单，随意逮捕进步同学，解聘进步教授。总之，在解放以前，工商学院是天津美国间谍活动的据点之一。
    解放以后，该犯等反动活动依然不变，反而变本加厉，利用教会中的反动组织“圣母御侍团”（即“圣母十字军”、“反共十字军”）作为反革命破坏活动的工具，每周星期五深夜在镇南道二三四号（前美国驻天津间谍机关Ｏ．Ｓ．Ｓ．驻地）秘密集会，研究如何对付各种爱国行动，为美帝国主义充当应声虫。当时，卜相贤担任该校副校长，鲍翊华任工学院院长，房如晦任商学院院长。他们利用职务之便，与同学一起到工厂参观时即详询生产情况、生产计划，并指示亲信教徒打入工厂机关，企图刺探情报。在校内不断调查我中共党员和青年团员的情况，煽动同学参加“反共游击队”，并散播反动言论。当美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争爆发以后，他们公开制造谣言，为美帝国主义吹嘘“三次世界大战”，散布无耻谣言。去年十一月，他们并曾秘密集会，商讨“如何对付抗美援朝运动”；卜犯相贤并曾亲著所谓“原子弹与宇宙精神”、“奥斯汀”等等反动小册，公开散发，还时常演映美国反动影片，组织同学收听“美国之音”，为美帝国主义进行反动宣传。该校有的爱国教徒曾要求参加军事干部学校，他们则恫吓说：“参加军事干部学校是帮助魔鬼，你就犯罪。”同时，卜相贤等不断地诬蔑新社会，公开指示教徒“不要响应人民政府号召”，并制止教徒与我党员团员及进步同学接近。在该校师生举行各项爱国集会时，他们则动员教徒回家。此外，该犯等一贯地抗拒人民政府的教育政策。今年一月，中央人民政府教育部为维护中国人民教育主权，接受了该校师生的要求，将卜犯相贤撤职。但该犯等反以人民政府之宽大为可欺，卜犯在医院内伪装养病，继续指挥反动活动，并决定什么“三年计划”，叫教徒们为他祈祷“安全”；并曾对教徒们说：“对付他们（指人民政府）真不容易”。鲍、房两犯在学校内亦仍不老老实实。当该校爱国教徒拥护自立革新运动展开签名时，他们则滥用“神权”，说他们是“叛教”，并停止他们“办神功”、“领圣礼”；鲍犯翊华并公开对该校教授范恩锟、吴健生（天津市天主教革新运动促进会委员）说：“你们犯罪了，你们总要后悔的。”利用各种卑鄙无耻的手段，阻挠破坏这一运动。
    该犯等的罪恶破坏活动，举不胜举。今年年初以来，津沽大学师生和爱国教徒，曾连续集会，不断地控诉该犯等的反动罪行，一致要求人民政府将他们逮捕法办。天津市人民政府公安局也曾收到很多要求惩办该犯等的信件。天津市公安局根据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例，于日前一举将该犯等捕获，并将依法提起公诉，予以制裁。
    【又讯】潜藏在津沽大学进行反革命活动的美帝国主义间谍分子，尚有邓惠达（又名邓尼Vde Denis）、柯守义（Petrus Klok）、狄守仁（Eduaurdus,Pctit）、刘乃仁（国民党特务）等，他们也都是天主教反动神甫。在解放以前，也均为献县间谍案的逃犯，与卜犯等勾结美蒋，狼狈为奸，进行反人民活动；解放以后，在我广大人民和公安机关的威力震慑之下，先后畏罪潜逃。
    【本报讯】天津津沽大学师生员工七百余人于二日下午举行反帝爱国控诉大会。会上天主教徒教授缪钟彝等、同学高树楷等二十余人沉痛控诉国际间谍卜相贤等的罪行，并对过去受他们蒙蔽表示愤怒。在控诉时，台下不断迸发出“津沽大学同学团结万岁！”“肃清校内帝国主义分子”等口号，天主教自立革新促进会代表吴健生及该校教务长王金鼎均在会上讲了话，号召津沽大学师生团结起来，彻底肃清校内的帝国主义分子。最后通过要求政府严厉处置美国间谍的决议。（附图片）
