　　Chen Dengke and His Novels
　　Kang Zhuo
　　In recent years, some writers of worker or peasant origin have emerged in our literary ranks. They have brought new blood to the people's literature and have been welcomed and valued by readers. Chen Dengke, the author who attracted people's attention not long ago with the novellas "Huoren Tang" and "Du Dasao", is one of these writers, and should be said to be one of the best among them.

　　Comrade Chen Dengke came from a poor peasant family. He farmed, pushed a cart, and was conscripted into the Kuomintang army. In 1940, he joined the revolutionary ranks. For the past ten years, he worked as a correspondent in local agencies for more than four years, and then worked as a reporter in a local newspaper. His cultural level is not high. He studied for two years when he was a child, but later forgot it. When he joined the revolution, he couldn't even write his own name. He began to learn culture in 1943, began writing correspondence for newspapers in 1944, and began literary writing in 1946. "Du Dasao" was his first novel, written in 1947, and published in 1948 by the Huazhong Xinhua Bookstore behind enemy lines at that time, and was welcomed by readers. "Huoren Tang" was written immediately after the publication of "Du Dasao". The first draft was completed in 1948, and after repeated revisions by himself, it was published in the October-November issue of "Shuo Shuo Chang Chang" last year. This work has also been well received, and is even more widely praised than "Du Dasao".

　　The two novels reflect events that occurred in the same area during the same period. They tell the story of the people in the old base areas of Central China, under the leadership of the Communist Party, uniting as one, tenaciously resisting, and fighting the enemy to the end after the Kuomintang bandit army launched a large-scale attack on the liberated areas in 1946, and finally winning a glorious victory. However, the two novels are not the same, each with its own brilliance and its own unique and profound meaning, and "Huoren Tang", in some senses, surpasses "Du Dasao".

　　"Du Dasao" describes: the bandit army's offensive completely destroyed the happiness of the first year's harvest after the peasants turned over. The husband of female Communist Party member Du Dasao (the main cadre of the village) transferred with our troops. Their home was looted, the whole family (sick mother-in-law and two children) were hungry all day long, and they were also forced to pay donations and taxes, forcing her to submit and be humiliated, forcing her to find her husband and return to "start anew"... She suffered rare hardships, and could hardly breathe. However, she was resolute and tenacious, and never yielded. Even in the enemy's prison and court, she was beaten several times until she was covered in blood and flesh, but she never said a soft word. On the contrary, her answers to the enemy were like bullets. As soon as she was released from prison, she sent her children to her grandmother's house and continued to fight the enemy. Her mother-in-law was killed by the enemy, and she herself was imprisoned for the second time, without eating a sip of tea for three days, but her fighting spirit grew higher and higher. After being released from prison again, in extremely difficult circumstances, she mobilized the peasants to form a "People's Self-Preservation Team", seized weapons from the enemy to attack the enemy. If they couldn't stay on land, they transferred to Hongze Lake, persevering under the siege of dozens of times more enemies, persevering in the face of hunger and disease, persevering in the face of the passive situation of casualties and losses, and actively attacking, breaking through thousands of layers of difficulties that were hard to believe. Finally, they persevered until the army went south, and cooperated with the main force to defeat the enemy. Du Dasao's team joined forces with the main force. Du Dasao and her two children were also reunited with her husband in the sound of victory in the war.

　　In "Huoren Tang", the scene that unfolds is even more magnificent than in "Du Dasao", with "the unity of the military and the people as one flesh and blood" as the most prominent theme.

　　Huoren Tang (Living People's Pond) is the name the common people gave to the building of Sun Zaitao, the feudal head of Xinheji. For fifty years, the Sun family ruled Xinheji, turning "more than twenty acres of surrounding black land into a piece of Sun Zaitao's cake", and every family in the market became his tenant. It is not known how many poor people were killed in Huoren Tang. In 1942, the New Fourth Army established a people's government here, and Sun Zaitao ran away secretly. The people reduced rent and interest, and carried out land reform. By the summer of 1946, it was "like flowers and plants in spring again". However, in the autumn, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army launched an offensive. The peasants who had turned over shouted in unison: "To have a good life for a long time, organize and fight Lao Jiang!" Men and women, amid the smoke of airplanes and artillery fire, enthusiastically supported the front. Widow Xue Lushi was Sun Zaitao's mortal enemy and an activist in the support-the-front movement. She and her two daughters, Dafengzi and Qiyuezi, mobilized the whole family and took the lead in everything.

　　Our troops were annihilating the enemy nearby, and combat hero Liu Gensheng continuously completed the most difficult tasks and made great contributions. When our army took the initiative to carry out a strategic retreat, Liu Gensheng was unfortunately wounded and captured by the enemy. The enemy forced Xue Lushi to dig a pit and bury Liu Gensheng alive. Xue Lushi replaced Liu Gensheng with her own dying youngest daughter, and meticulously nursed him, sheltered him.

　　After this, Sun Zaitao, in conjunction with Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army, implemented an extremely barbaric rule in Xinheji. Liu Gensheng's wounds slowly healed, and he contacted the Party organization outside, cleverly leading Party members and the masses to resist grain, resist conscription, and oppose burning and killing. The struggle lasted for fifteen months, through all kinds of disasters, and many people died. Finally, when the army went south, Liu Gensheng led the local comrades to act as internal support, personally blew up the enemy's ammunition depot, and cooperated with the army to completely eliminate the enemy, and the masses captured Sun Zaitao alive.

　　During this year, Dafengzi carefully served Liu Gensheng, and under Liu Gensheng's leadership, carried out an unyielding struggle. They pretended to be sisters in life, and they naturally developed feelings like brother and sister. When the battle ended, Liu Gensheng returned to the team and continued south with the army. Dafengzi took Liu Gensheng's hand and said: "Don't forget! Even if we are in different places, I will wait for you to the death!" Liu Gensheng also held Dafengzi's hand and replied: "Don't worry!" This is a pure and precious feeling! The novel's ending like this, summarizing the whole article, cannot help but fill us with the courage to fight, and the confidence to move forward forever for the ideal of happiness.

　　Both novels use direct expression methods, with complete structures from beginning to end (here, "Huoren Tang" is more complete than "Du Dasao"), to describe the situation in the early days of the Liberation War in a simple and natural way. On the one hand, the US-Chiang Kai-shek clique and the feudal landlords colluded with each other, and on the other hand, the military and civilians in the liberated areas were more closely united. The author directly describes the sharpest and most prominent struggle between these two aspects. This is a bloody struggle with no room for consideration, where it is a matter of life and death, and the enemy and us are clearly distinguished. The author boldly displays all the extremely tragic scenes that are even difficult to express in words, with strong colors and great momentum, so that we can fully feel the serious situation and the struggle of the Chinese people at that time. The two novels should be said to be true artistic records of that era. There are really not many works like this, and even writers who have boldly touched similar themes may not be many.

　　Regarding the characters, the author mainly praises the new heroic figures, and arranges the heroes in positive actions and struggles, undergoing various tests to grow and strengthen. The author has not treated his heroes in a static or vague way, so his heroic figures are clear and active.

　　The character of the heroic figures is as tenacious and resolute as if they cannot be broken, beaten, killed, or cut down. We see Du Dasao: the enemy, and even individual backward peasants, persuaded her to find her husband and return to "start anew", "Start anew, I will harm him, no... I would rather die than be a coward..." This is what she thought at the time. She never wavered in court, and after being released from prison, she thought for the sake of the struggle: "Men can take guns to kill the enemy, can't I take guns? Can't I go to war? Can't I kill the enemy?" And when she formed the "People's Self-Preservation Team" and declared war on the enemy, how strong was the "oath": "Kill, fight, kill and kill, burn and burn, move a hair, erect a flag... Guns have eyes, knives have mouths, don't kill people without hatred!" What a thrilling revolutionary spirit this is!

　　Communist Party member Liu Gensheng in "Huoren Tang", on the battlefield, is: "I, Liu Gensheng, joined the Party on the front line, and I want to test myself permanently on the front line." He completed several of the most difficult tasks in a row, and was so tired that he fell asleep as soon as he returned, but when he heard that there was another difficult task, he "was startled and sat up: 'I'll go...'" He put on his grenades and left. After being wounded and captured, he said to the enemy, "Raising his head and patting his chest: 'Okay, just stab me here!'" After being rescued by Xue Lushi, the Party assigned him to stay, and he cleverly led the victorious struggle; but when the demolition of the house inevitably failed, he "felt sad and reviewed: '...It's my fault—not organizing and leading the struggle, lacking a core backbone, and being paralyzed by Sun Zaitao's delaying tactics...'" After that, he became more alert, and in the face of such a disparity in the strength of the enemy and ourselves, he won victory after victory through soft and hard tactics, and even armed actions. And finally, he personally scouted the situation and blew up the enemy's ammunition depot, and was so calm, composed, and courageous.

　　As for the heroic Xue Lushi and her daughters, who used their own flesh and blood to save Liu Gensheng's life, this act of dying for another is enough to show their strength. Xue Lushi's answer to the enemy's attack was: "If he wants my liver, I want his guts!" Her attitude towards supporting the front was: "My whole family will go!" She was feeding one wounded soldier rice soup, and then went to help another with his bowel movement. When Dafengzi saw her mother and Liu Gensheng grinding wheat at the door while taking care of Liu Gensheng for a long time, she "rolled her eyes: 'You are all good! You won't give up until you knock down a few people!'" When her mother saw her "scolding Liu Gensheng, her face flushed: 'Dafengzi... You look like a mad dog, biting people when you see them. What did that kid do to you?' Dafengzi blushed, turned her head, and hugged Liu Gensheng: 'Qiyuezi, how many people are worried about you! If your injury heals, I will die in peace!'" Is this ordinary care? Or simple affection between children? This is extremely intimate emotion, and it is also healthy emotion. Look, in the face of a powerful enemy, Dafengzi is again: "Put up a machine gun and shoot us to death!" And rush up in the face of the bayonet: "Stab me to death!"

　　The reason why heroes are tenacious is based on certain reasons. Xue Lushi sighed to Liu Gensheng: "Alas! Bitter root to bitter root..." Xue Lushi also thought: "Xinheji is a man-eating dog—Sun Zaitao. He killed my man and seized my family's fields and houses for thirteen years. The Communist Party helped me take them back. The hatred has not yet been avenged, and he wants to come back..." Xue Lushi also said to the wounded: "My family's deep hatred depends on you to avenge for me, and my three women's lives also depend on you to protect..." Du Dasao also thought: "If the head of the Home-Returning Corps, Ru Yi, comes back, the people's lives will be gone." Therefore, "To live, you have to rely on yourself to fight for a way out." At the same time, the heroes all remembered the Party's education, firmly believed that "the New Fourth Army will definitely come back", and personally experienced the strength of the masses and the love of the masses for themselves, and also saw the shameful end of those who surrendered being killed by the enemy... For the awakened people, suffering and hatred are strength, the ideal of a happy life is strength, and the unity of the Party, the people's army, and the people themselves is strength. This strength is the basis for the heroes' tenacity, and it is also the basis of the class. Therefore, the heroes are not only tenacious, but also extraordinarily clear about the enemy and us, and even for traitors and all friends who can be won over, the novel writes about the heroes' clear policy ideas and strategic handling.

　　But the heroes are all ordinary people, and each has its own different personality. Du Dasao is a bit shrewish, and Xue Lushi is very kind. They have been sad, cried, complained, and even asked the heavens and Buddhas to protect them in the face of difficulties; but as soon as they reached a critical moment, they immediately straightened their chests and never compromised. Dafengzi is also very ordinary, but she is more enthusiastic and brave than the older generation. Liu Gensheng has no personal plans at all, but he is just a simple, hardworking, and brave ordinary combat hero.

　　The language of the work is also good. Comrade Chen Dengke created a simple, vivid, and uniquely mass-style language, whether it is dialogue, narration, description, or even psychological description. Here are a few examples. Describing the liveliness of Xinheji: "In the past, there were four markets every ten days. Every one, four, seven, and nine, people inside and outside the street, pushing each other's heads, selling and buying money on people's heads. The common people went to the street three times, and they didn't even want to go to the Shanghai Great World." But after Sun Zaitao squeezed it dry, "you can't hit anyone with a brick on the street, it's like it's turned into a dead street." Look again: "Fengjie, look, the sky suddenly changed after lunch, the sky was dark, thunder roared and lightning flashed, Mom was afraid it would rain. Now it's just midnight, and the moon in the dark clouds is gradually brightening again, and the sun will come out tomorrow! The sky over our Huoren Tang will also clear up soon!" Is Liu Gensheng's passage simply describing the scenery? No! It vividly paints the scene of the struggle at that time. Also: "A Communist Party member must not be bent or broken in fire and guns..." How powerful is this! This is what Liu Gensheng said, and it just brings out Liu Gensheng's character.

　　From Comrade Chen Dengke's two powerful novels, we can say that he is a very talented writer. But this is by no means an achievement that the author can achieve solely by talent. The working people's demand for culture after turning over is strong. Chen Dengke has been studying very hard since 1943. In 1944, when he was a worker-peasant correspondent, he was praised by the newspaper. In 1946, when he was a reporter, he was praised by the Central China Propaganda and Education Conference. Before and after writing these two novels, he published more than 300 news reports and 20 literary works. The short report "Iron Bones" greatly promoted the mass movement at that time, and Jianyang County also adapted it into a Huai opera and performed it everywhere, with great effect. During this period, the leaders have always valued him and helped him study. The Party branch also assigned a special person to help him, and the responsible comrades of the newspaper often helped him process materials and revise articles. At the same time, he came from the working people and has never left the working people. For ten years, he has almost always worked on the front line of the war. As a reporter, he interviewed while fighting guerrillas. In 1947, he personally insisted on fighting in Hongze Lake, which gave him extremely rich struggle experiences. His attitude towards literary writing is extremely honest. His first prose was written because he was sincerely moved by an experience. At that time, he did not even know that it was called literature. People said it was literature and published it for him. Later, he slowly learned about literature; he also said that he felt as if there were countless people and soldiers in his heart, who shed blood and sacrificed for peace and freedom, and created earth-shattering heroic deeds. If he didn't write them out, he felt sorry for them. From the above situation, for Comrade Chen Dengke's achievements, we can completely believe what he said to me: the main thing is the result of the Party's education. Of course, this is also the victory of Chairman Mao's literary policy!

　　陈登科和他的小说
    康濯
    近几年来，在我们文艺的队伍里，出现了一些工人或农民出身的作家，他们给人民文艺带来了新的血液，引起了读者的欢迎和重视。不久以前，以中篇小说《活人塘》和《杜大嫂》受到人们注意的作者陈登科，就是这些作家里边的一个，而且，应该说是这些作家里边的优秀的一个。
    陈登科同志出身贫农，种过田，推过车，给国民党征去当过兵。一九四○年参加革命队伍，十年来，在地方机关里当了四年多通讯员，以后一直在地方报社作记者。他的文化水平不高，小时候念过二年书，后来忘干了，参加革命的时候，连自己的名字也写不上。一九四三年开始学文化，一九四四年开始给报纸写通讯，一九四六年开始文艺写作。《杜大嫂》是他的第一部小说，一九四七年写成，一九四八年由当时敌后的华中新华书店出版以后，受到读者的欢迎。《活人塘》是紧接《杜大嫂》出版以后写的，初稿完成于一九四八年，经过他自己多次的修改，发表在去年十月十一月出版的《说说唱唱》上。这篇作品也得到了好评，而且是比《杜大嫂》更广泛的好评。
    两部小说反映的，是同一地区同一时期发生的事件，是一九四六年国民党匪军大举进攻解放区以后，华中老根据地的人民，在共产党的领导下，团结一致，顽强不屈，与敌人斗争到底，最后得到光荣胜利的故事。但两部小说并不雷同，各有各的光辉和各自独特的深长的意义，而《活人塘》，从某些意义上说，又超过了《杜大嫂》。
    《杜大嫂》写的是：匪军的进攻，完全破坏了农民翻身后第一年丰收的幸福。女共产党员杜大嫂的丈夫（村里主要干部）跟我们队伍转移了，家被洗劫一空，一家人（害病的婆婆和两个孩子）整天挨着饿，而且还被逼捐逼税，逼迫她屈服受辱，逼使她找丈夫回来“自新”……她经受的是少有的苦难，简直一口气也喘不过来。但是，她坚决顽强，绝不屈服，就是在敌人的监牢里和法庭上，几次被打得浑身血肉模糊，也始终没说过半句软一点的话，相反，回答敌人的句句是好像枪弹似的语言。一出狱，她把孩子送到外婆家，继续跟敌人斗争。婆婆被敌人杀害了，她自己第二次入狱，三天没吃一口茶水，可是斗志愈长愈高，再出狱后，就在极艰难的情况下，发动农民，成立起“人民保命队”，夺过敌人的武器来打击敌人。陆地上呆不了就转移到洪泽湖里，在几十倍敌人的团团围剿下坚持，在饥饿疾病的情况下坚持，在伤亡损失的消极情况下坚持，并积极出击，突破千重万重难以令人相信的难关。最后，终于坚持到大军南下，配合主力打败了敌人。杜大嫂的队伍与主力会合。杜大嫂和她两个孩子，也与丈夫在战争胜利声中，胜利地会合。
    在《活人塘》里，展开的场面甚至比《杜大嫂》还要壮烈，而以“军民血肉一体”为最突出的主题思想。
    活人塘，是老百姓给新河集封建头子孙在涛的大楼房取的名字。五十年来，孙家统治着新河集，把“周围二十多顷的黑土地变为孙在涛一块饼”，集上家家成了他的佃户，活人塘里不知被害死了多少穷人。一九四二年新四军在这里成立了人民政权，孙在涛偷跑了，人民减租减息、土地改革，到一九四六年夏季，这里才“又像春天的花草一样”。可是，就在秋天，蒋匪军发动了进攻。翻身的农民“一条声的喊：‘要得好日子过得长，组织起来打老蒋！’”男男女女，在飞机炮火硝烟里面，热烈支援前线。寡妇薛陆氏是孙在涛的死对头，也是支前运动中的积极分子，她和她两个女儿大凤子、七月子，全家出动，事事走在前头。
    我们的队伍在附近痛歼着敌人，战斗英雄刘根生连续完成着最艰险的任务，功劳很大。在我军主动进行战略撤退的时候，刘根生不幸负伤，被敌人俘虏，敌人强迫薛陆氏挖坑活埋刘根生。薛陆氏以牺牲自己快死的亲生小女儿，替换了刘根生，并无微不至地给他养伤，掩护他。
    这以后，孙在涛结合蒋匪军，在新河集实行着极野蛮的统治。刘根生伤慢慢好了，与外边党的组织取得联系，机智地领导党员和群众抗粮抗丁反烧杀。斗争坚持了十五个月，历尽灾祸，死了好多人，最后大军南下，刘根生领着当地的同志作内应，亲自炸毁了敌人的弹药库，配合大军彻底消灭了敌人，群众并活捉了孙在涛。
    在这一年多当中，大凤子小小心心地侍候着刘根生，并在刘根生的领导下，进行不屈的斗争。他们生活上装成姐妹，他们也自然地发生了亲兄亲妹一样的感情。当战斗结束，刘根生归队跟随大军继续南下，大凤拉着刘根生的手说：“你不要忘记！虽是天南地北，我也要死等着你！”刘根生也握着大凤的手回答：“你放心吧！”这是纯洁的宝贵的感情！小说这样的结尾，总括全篇，不禁使我们充满了斗争的勇气，和为幸福的理想而永远前进的信心。
    两部小说都是以直接的表现方法，以有头有尾的完整的结构（在这里，《活人塘》比《杜大嫂》更完整），朴实、自然地描写了解放战争初期的情况。一方面美蒋与封建地主相互勾结，另一方面解放区军民更紧密地团结，作者正面地描写了这两方面的针锋相对，最尖锐、最突出的斗争。这是你死我活、敌我分明、毫无考虑余地的血淋淋的斗争。一切惨烈无比的甚至很难用文字表现的场面，作者都大胆地展示开来，色彩浓，气势大，使我们完全感受到当时中国人民严重的情况和斗争的情景。两部小说应该说就是那个时代的真实的艺术的记录，像这样的作品实在还不多见，甚至连大胆接触过类似题材的作家，怕也不多。
    关于人物，作者主要是歌颂新的英雄人物，并且是把英雄安排在正面的行动和斗争中，经受各种考验而成长壮大。作者没有静止地、或模糊地处理过他的英雄，因而他的英雄人物都是明确的、活动的。
    英雄人物的性格，是敲不断、打不烂、杀不死、砍不倒那样的顽强坚决。我们看杜大嫂：敌人、甚至连个别落后的农民也劝她去找丈夫回来“自新”，“自新，我坑害他，不……硬死不做孬汉子……”这是她当时想的。法庭上她决不动摇，出狱后她为了斗争，想道：“男子能拿枪，杀敌人，我就不能拿枪吗？我就不能去打仗吗？我就不能杀仇人吗？”而当她组成了“人民保命队”，向敌人宣战的时候，“誓词”是何等强烈：“杀，拚，杀还杀，烧还烧，动一根毫毛，竖一根旗杆……枪有眼，刀有口，不杀没冤没仇人！”这是何等惊心动魄的革命气概！
    《活人塘》里的共产党员刘根生，在战场上是：“我刘根生是在火线上参加党的，我要永久在火线上考验自己。”连续完成了几次最艰险的任务，累得回来一睡就迷糊了，但听说又有困难任务，他“心里一惊，坐起来：‘我去……’”插好手榴弹就走。而负伤被俘后，对敌人又是“昂起头，拍拍胸口说：‘好，你就对我这块戳一刀吧！’”被薛陆氏救出，党分配他留下，他机智地领导着胜利的斗争；但反拆房时不得已失败，他就“心里难过，检讨着：‘……是我的罪——没有组织领导斗争，缺乏核心骨干，中了孙在涛缓兵计的麻痹……’”以后，他更机警起来，在敌我力量那样悬殊的情况下，软磨硬斗，甚至武装行动，节节胜利。而最后自己亲自侦察情况，炸毁敌人弹药库，又是那样地沉着、镇静，勇往直前。
    至于以自己的亲生骨肉，用替死来救活刘根生的英雄薛陆氏母女，仅以这个替死的行为，就足以表现她们的坚强了。薛陆氏对敌人进攻的回答是：“他要我肝花，我要他肚肠！”对支援前线是：“我家都去！”照顾伤员是正喂着一个的米汤，又去帮另一个大便。而在长期照顾刘根生的时候，有一回大凤子看见妈妈跟刘根生在门口搓麦，她“把眼一翻：‘都是好样儿的！不拖倒几个人不能拉倒！’”妈妈见她把刘根生“菜瓜了一顿，满脸火星直冒：‘大凤子……你看你跟疯狗一样，逢人咬人，那伢子又怎的你啊？’大凤子脸一红，掉回头，搂住刘根生：‘七月子，有多少人担心着你啊！你伤好了，我苦死也闭眼的！’”这难道是普通的照顾？或者是简单的儿女之情？这是亲切至极的感情，也是健康的感情。你看，在强大的敌人面前，大凤子又是：“你把机枪架起来扫死我们吧！”并面对刺刀冲上去：“你戳死我！”
    英雄的所以顽强，都是有根据的。薛陆氏对刘根生叹息过：“唉！苦根对苦根……”薛陆氏还想过：“新河集一条吃人的狗——孙在涛，他害死我家男人，霸占去我家田地、房屋十三年，共产党帮我夺回来，仇还未报，他又要回来……”薛陆氏又对伤员说过：“我家杀身大仇，靠你们替我报，我娘儿三个的性命，也靠你们保着……”杜大嫂也想过：“还乡团大队长如一回来，老百姓的命就没得了。”因而，“要活命，就要靠自己去拚出活路来。”同时，英雄们都牢记着党的教育，坚信着“新四军一定要回来”，并亲身体验到群众的力量和群众对自己的爱护，还看到了投降者被敌人杀害的可耻下场……对于觉悟了的人民，苦和仇恨就是力量，幸福生活的理想就是力量，党、人民军队和人民自己的团结，就是力量。这力量就是英雄们顽强的根据，也就是阶级的根据。因此，英雄们不仅顽强，而且异常敌友分明，甚至对叛徒，对一切可以争取的朋友，小说中都写出了英雄们明确的政策思想和策略的处理。
    但英雄们又都是平常的人，并且各有各的不同的性格。杜大嫂有些泼辣，薛陆氏非常善良，她们在困难面前还曾多次地伤心，流泪、埋怨甚至求天求菩萨保佑；只是一到紧要关头，就立刻挺起胸来，决不妥协。大凤子也很平常，可她比老一辈更热情勇敢。刘根生一点也没有个人打算，可也不过是一个朴实勤劳勇敢的普通战斗英雄。
    作品的语言也是好的。陈登科同志创造的，是朴素的形象的有独特的大众风格的群众语言，不论对话叙述描写甚至心理描写，都是这样。这里随便举几条。描写新河集的热闹：“从前十天四集，每逢一四七九街里街外的人，这头推那头晃，人头上接钱做买卖，老百姓到街上跑过三趟，上海大世界也不想去了。”但到孙在涛榨干了这里以后，“街上扔砖头也砸不到人，活像变成了死街”。再看：“凤姐，你看，中饭后天陡陡变的，满天黑洞洞，雷吼喝闪，妈妈怕下雨，现在刚到半夜，在乌云里的月亮，渐渐又发亮，明天太阳会出来的！我们这活人塘的天也快晴开了！”刘根生这段话，是单纯描写风景么？不！这简直把当时斗争的情景也鲜活地画出来了。还有：“一个共产党员，要在火里，枪里，烧不弯，打不折……”这多么有力量！这是刘根生说的，也正好烘托出了刘根生的性格。
    从陈登科同志这两部充满力量的小说，我们可以说他是一个很有才能的作家。但这也决不是作者单凭才能所能达到的成就。劳动人民翻身以后对文化的要求是强烈的，陈登科从一九四三年开始，学习就一直是非常刻苦。一九四四年当工农通讯员，就曾受到报社表扬，一九四六年当记者，又受到华中宣教大会的表扬。而在写这两部小说前后，他发表过三百多篇新闻通讯和二十来篇文艺作品，短篇报告《铁骨头》并曾给当时的群众运动以很大的推动作用，建阳县还曾改编成淮戏到处演唱，效果很大。这当中，领导上一直重视他，始终帮助他学习，党的支部还指定过专人给他帮助，报社负责同志也经常帮他处理材料、改文章。同时，他出身于劳动人民，始终没离开劳动人民，十年来几乎经常在战争的前线工作，当记者也是一边打游击一边采访，一九四七年并亲自在洪泽湖里坚持斗争，这使他有着极丰富的斗争生活。他写文艺的态度极其老实，第一篇散文是对一件经历过的事衷心感动了，就写了出来，当时他还并不知道那就叫文艺，人家说那是文艺，给他发表了，以后他才慢慢知道了文艺这件事；他还说过：他心里好像有无数的人民、战士，他们为着和平自由流血牺牲，创造出了惊天动地的英雄事迹，他如不写出来，就觉着对不起他们。从以上情形，对于陈登科同志的成就，我们完全可以相信他自己对我说的话：主要的，是党教育的结果。当然，这也是毛主席文艺方针的胜利！
