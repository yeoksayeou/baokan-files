Luo Yuchuan and Jia Xinzhai, Vice Chairmen of Pingyuan Province
　　Lead Six Hundred Cadres to the Countryside to Guide Drought Resistance and Cotton Planting Hebei's Handan, Shijiazhuang, Xingtai and other regions begin sowing.
    Now is the appropriate time for planting cotton in North China. Pingyuan Province is experiencing a lack of rain this spring. In order to complete the task of planting six million mu of cotton, the Provincial People's Government has issued instructions on drought resistance and planting, calling on cotton farmers to take immediate action to overcome the spring drought. Luo Yuchuan and Jia Xinzhai, Vice Chairmen of the province, as well as the heads of the Agriculture and Forestry Department, Civil Affairs Department, Finance Department, and Culture and Education Department, are leading 600 cadres of the Provincial People's Government to various places to guide drought resistance and cotton planting. All special districts and counties in the province will also mobilize 15,000 to 20,000 cadres to go deep into rural areas to help farmers with drought resistance and planting.
    Also: Handan Prefecture in Hebei began planting cotton on the 17th, and some villages have already overfulfilled their cotton planting tasks. Shijiazhuang and Xingtai Prefectures and other drought-stricken areas are intensively carrying out planting by utilizing soil moisture (this is a drought-resistant planting method, i.e., breaking open the dry soil and sowing the cotton seeds on the moist soil. See the comic strip on page 3 of this newspaper in recent days for reference).

　　平原省罗玉川、贾心斋副主席
　  带领六百干部下乡领导抗旱种棉  　河北邯郸、石家庄、邢台等专区开始播种
    目前正是华北种棉的适宜时期，平原省今春缺雨，该省人民政府为完成六百万亩的植棉任务，除发布抗旱点种指示，号召棉农立即行动起来，战胜春旱外，该省罗玉川、贾心斋副主席及农林厅长、民政厅长、财政厅长、文教厅长等率领该省人民政府干部六百人，分赴各地领导抗旱种棉。全省各专区、县也即将动员干部一万五千人到二万人，深入各地农村，帮助农民抗旱点种。
    又：河北邯郸专区十七日起已开始种棉，有些村已超额完成植棉任务。石家庄专区、邢台专区等缺雨地区，正紧张地进行借墒播种（这是抗旱的播种方法，即：耠开干土，把棉籽播在湿土上。可参看近几天本报第三版的连环画）。
