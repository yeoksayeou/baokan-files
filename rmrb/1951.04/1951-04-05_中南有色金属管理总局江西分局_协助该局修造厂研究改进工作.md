Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editorial Department:

After your newspaper published reader Gu Jiancheng's criticism on February 25th in "Readers' Letters" regarding the bureaucratic tendencies in the leadership of our bureau's affiliated Repair and Manufacturing Plant, we immediately dispatched personnel to the plant to investigate. We now submit the following report to you:

(1) The issue of repairing and fitting parts for the 390-horsepower diesel engine is as follows: In 1950, when repairing the Dajishan diesel engine, the Repair and Manufacturing Plant's Engineering Office originally planned to go to Shanghai to repair and fit parts at a cost of approximately 60 million yuan. Later, the plant's workers requested to repair it themselves. However, Director Zhang subjectively believed that the plant's workers lacked the technical skills and therefore did not give a clear answer. Later, the workers petitioned the branch bureau, and the plant then approved the workers to repair it themselves. When discussing the issue of rewards, the workers requested that half of the difference between the estimated repair cost in Shanghai and the plant's self-repair cost be given as a bonus. The plant did not agree. Furthermore, because there were no clear reward measures, the workers defiantly said, "We are too busy to repair and fit the parts." During the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend Our Homes and Country, the workers voluntarily requested the task of repairing and fitting the diesel engine parts from the administration, without mentioning the issue of rewards. On December 27th, they indeed completed the task ahead of schedule, which is a concrete manifestation of the workers' increased class consciousness and love for the motherland. Based on the principle of "an inch of production growth means an inch of welfare growth," the branch bureau awarded a bonus equivalent to 10% of the difference between the estimated repair cost in Shanghai and the self-repair cost. It is clear that the main reason for this incident was that the plant's administration did not firmly establish the idea of relying on the working class to improve production, did not understand the workers' production skills and morale, and did not have correct reward standards, which led to the problem dragging on for a long time and causing losses in production.

(2) The main reason why five lathes were not completed on time was that the plant did not have technical personnel to create drawings in early 1949, and there were no lathe drawings. Therefore, the workers' work lacked a basis, and the dimensions were inconsistent. Drawings were started in 1950, but the drawings were not well inspected, so the castings often did not match.

(3) Regarding safety, hygiene, and employee welfare, the plant has indeed not paid enough attention. Currently, there is only one toilet and four urinals for all employees in the plant and warehouses. Workers have to go to the open space outside the gate to relieve themselves, which delays production time.

(4) Regarding the issue of buying twenty tons of unusable iron, the iron was actually allocated by the South Central Region Nonferrous Metals Management Bureau's Business Department, and the responsibility does not lie with the Repair and Manufacturing Plant.

We are currently working with the plant to research and improve the above-mentioned shortcomings.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　中南有色金属管理总局江西分局         
    协助该局修造厂研究改进工作编辑同志：
    二月二十五日贵报《读者来信》发表读者顾建成对本局所属修造厂领导上存在着官僚主义的批评后，我们立即派人前往该厂进行了解，现将情况报告给你们：
    （一）关于三百九十匹马力柴油机零件的修配问题是这样的：一九五○年修理大吉山柴油机时，修造厂工务室原准备去上海修配约六千万元的零件。后来厂里工人要求自己修理。但张厂长主观认为修造厂工人技术差，因而未作明确答复。后来工人向分局去请求，厂里才批准工人自己修理。当讨论奖励问题时，工人要求照上海修理费的估价与厂里自修费的差数一半给奖。厂里不答应。又因为没有明确的奖励办法，所以工人赌气说“工作忙，不能修配了”。在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，工人又自动向行政上要求修配柴油机的任务，并不谈奖励问题。十二月二十七日果然提前完成任务，这是工人提高阶级觉悟，热爱祖国的具体表现。分局根据“生产长一寸福利长一分”的原则，按上海修配估价与自修费用的差额的一成给奖。由此可见造成这一事件的主要原因是：该厂行政没有很好树立依靠工人阶级搞好生产的思想，不了解工人的生产技术与生产情绪，没有正确的奖励标准，以致问题拖拉了很久，使生产上受到损失。
    （二）五部车床没有按时完工的主要原因，是在一九四九年初间厂里没有制图的技术人员，没有绘制车床图样，因此工人工作没有依据，搞的分寸大小不符合。一九五○年开始绘了图，但对图样没有很好检查，因此铸件往往驴唇不对马嘴。
    （三）安全卫生与职工福利问题，厂里的确注意得不够。现在厂里及堆栈所有职工，仅有一个厕所和四个小便桶。工人大小便要跑到门外旷场去，耽误了生产时间。
    （四）关于买了二十吨铁不能用的问题，实际上铁是中南区有色金属管理局经理部拨来的，责任不在于修造厂。
    上述存在的缺点，我们正在协同该厂研究改进中。
