Datong Coal Mine Values Workers' Wisdom and Creativity
	Successful Implementation of New Mining Method
The state-owned Datong Coal Mine adopted the rationalization proposal of tunneling worker Yan Fushou for improved labor organization, replacing the single-tunneling method with a multi-tunnel circular tunneling method (in preparation for coal mining), creating a new record of 1.4 meters per worker (tunneling worker).

The mine has traditionally used the single-tunneling method, with a certain number of tunneling workers using one electric drill, along with several cart pushers, to tunnel one lane. When using this tunneling method, for safety reasons, after blasting once, it was necessary to wait fifteen to thirty minutes before the tunneling workers could enter the face, first needing to shovel coal (i.e., dump the blasted coal four or five feet away from the face to clear the face) before continuing to use the electric drill to drill holes and tunnel. Shoveling coal was the most laborious task, taking one hour each time, and the shoveled coal had to be loaded onto carts by cart pushers and pushed out. This often led to a lack of coordination between tunneling workers and cart pushers, with some being busy and others idle, and the electric drill was often left idle, wasting time, manpower, and affecting the efficiency of the machine. The multi-tunnel circular tunneling method first improved the organization of labor. For example, in the mine's No. 102 tunneling area, there were nine tunneling workers and eight cart pushers, who were previously divided into three groups, each tunneling one lane. Now they are divided into three shifts, day and night, jointly tunneling two lanes. The work situation is as follows: tunneling workers use electric drills to drill holes in lane A, and after blasting, they switch to lane B to drill holes, while cart pushers go to lane A to shovel coal, load carts, and push them out. Tunneling workers and cart pushers carry out continuous circular production in two lanes, without affecting each other's working time. This has doubled the tunneling time compared to the past and has allowed the full performance of technology and machine efficiency. Cart pushers no longer experience delays due to lack of coal to push.

The creator of this tunneling method is Yan Fushou, a tunneling worker from the mine's No. 6 well, who has twenty years of experience in the mine. After liberation, Yan's class consciousness improved, and he focused on improving production. Last year, he painstakingly researched for several months before coming up with this method to improve production. After suggesting it to his superiors, he immediately received the enthusiastic support of Director He Shui. In late November of last year, the mine first trialed it in three tunneling areas, including No. 102 in No. 6 well. At that time, due to a lack of sufficient preparation, the production quota was too high, and the workers lacked confidence in completing the task, coupled with chaotic labor allocation, so the initial trial failed. After thorough research by the tunneling workers, a reasonable quota was determined, the labor force was organized rationally, and it was widely promoted in early January of this year in conjunction with the patriotic production competition movement. Each group in the No. 102 tunneling area also challenged the Ma Hengchang group. In the past two months, they have created thirteen new tunneling records. The most recent new record is 1.4 meters tunneled per worker (tunneling worker), exceeding the quota by 110 percent. Moreover, Ma Liuhaizi, a national labor model and manual tunneling expert from the mine, and another manual tunneling worker, Lian Wanlu, after using electric drills for tunneling, united two relatively backward technical workers and implemented the multi-tunnel circular tunneling method from March, also achieving a new record of 4.3 meters tunneled per shift.

### 大同煤矿重视工人智慧与创造  实行新法掘进成功

　　大同煤矿重视工人智慧与创造       
    实行新法掘进成功
    国营大同煤矿采用掘进工人燕福寿的改进劳动组织的合理化建议，以多孔道循环掘进法（给采煤作准备）代替单孔道掘进法，创出了每工（掘进工）能掘进一米四的新纪录。
    该矿历来采用单孔道掘进方法，以一定数量的掘进工人，使用一台电钻，配合几个推车工，掘进一道巷。使用这种掘进法时，为了保安，在放一遍炮后，必须等十五至三十分钟的时间，掘进工才能进掌子，先要攉煤（即把打下来的煤倒到离掌子四五尺远的地方，腾清了掌子面），才能继续用电钻打眼掘进。攉煤最费事，每次需要一个钟头，攉出的煤又必须由推车工装上车子推出。这样就造成掘进工和推车工常常调合不开，忙闲不均，电钻亦常常闲在那里的现象，十分浪费时间、人力和影响机器效能。多孔道循环掘进法首先改进了劳动力的组合。如该矿一○二号掘进区有九个掘进工，八个推车工，过去分成三组，各自掘进一道巷。现在分成昼夜三班，联合掘进两道巷。工作情形是这样：掘进工在甲巷用电钻打眼，放炮后，就转入乙巷打眼，推车工就到甲巷攉煤装车推出，掘进工和推车工在两道巷子里进行连续的循环生产，互不影响工作时间。这就使掘进时间比过去增加了一倍，并得以充分地发挥了技术和机器的效能，推车工也不再因无煤可推而发生误工现象。
    创造这个掘进方法的人是该矿六号井掘进工人燕福寿，他在该矿已有二十年工龄。解放后，燕的阶级觉悟提高，一心注意改进生产。去年苦心钻研了几个月，才想出了这个改进生产的方法，向上级建议后，立刻得到何水局长的热烈支持，去年十一月下旬，该矿在六号井一○二号等三个掘进区首先试行。当时因为缺乏充分酝酿，生产定额过高，工人没信心完成任务，加上劳动力分配混乱，因此初步试行失败。在经过掘进工人们的充分研究后，确定了合理的定额，合理地组织了劳动力，于今年一月初结合了爱国主义生产竞赛运动广泛地推行。一○二号掘进区各小组并向马恒昌小组应了战，二个多月来，他们已创出了十三次掘进新纪录，最近一次新纪录是每工（掘进工）掘进一米四，超过了定额百分之一百一十。又全国劳动模范，该矿人工掘进能手马六孩与另一人工掘进工连万禄自使用电钻掘进后，团结了二个比较落后的技术工，从三月份起实行多孔道循环掘进法，也达到了一班掘进四米三的新纪录。
