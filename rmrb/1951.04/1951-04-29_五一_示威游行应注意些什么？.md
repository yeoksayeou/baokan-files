　　What to Pay Attention to During the May Day Demonstration Parade?
　　Lin Hong
　　The upcoming national "May Day" demonstration parade will be large in scale and involve many people. Therefore, the time required for the parade will be relatively long. To prevent participants from becoming overly fatigued and to maintain their enthusiasm throughout, departments responsible for preparing the demonstration parade in various regions should pay attention to the following:

　　First, at the demonstration parade rally, there should not be too many speakers. All speeches should be as brief and clear as possible, mainly explaining the significance of resisting America and aiding Korea, opposing the United States' arming of Japan, and defending world peace, and calling on the people to complete current tasks. In the past, some places held mass rallies where leaders of various agencies and organizations all had to speak, and most speeches were lengthy and verbose, resulting in the masses becoming very tired. This must be avoided.

　　Second, many people in large and medium-sized cities will participate in the demonstration parade. It takes a considerable amount of time to gather all the teams at the venue. To avoid the phenomenon of teams crossing paths when converging on the venue or during the parade, which would delay the masses, the departments responsible for preparation should notify each unit in advance of their standing location in the venue, the time and direction of entry into the venue, the parade route, and the units in front of and behind them. When the teams converge on the venue and set off for the parade, there should be dedicated personnel to direct the teams of each unit. Obstacles on the venue and along the assembly and parade routes should be cleared in advance, and the venue rules should be issued to each unit. Each unit should promptly convey these rules to the participants, reminding everyone to observe them to maintain good order within the venue. After receiving the notification, each unit must strictly abide by the regulations and arrive at the venue at the designated time and from the designated route; otherwise, it will still easily cause the phenomenon of teams crossing paths. In addition, the mass teams must assemble at the venue on time before the meeting, but attention should also be paid not to assemble the teams too early to avoid causing fatigue to the masses and a lack of energy during the parade.

　　Third, the drinking water for the masses is an important issue that must be addressed by dedicated personnel. In general cities, residents near the venue and along the parade route can be organized to set up tea stations. The jars for holding tea should be covered to prevent unclean water from harming everyone's health. At the same time, sufficient temporary toilets should be set up in appropriate places according to the distribution of the masses in the venue.

　　Fourth, first aid stations should be set up at appropriate locations in the venue and along the parade route, jointly organized by local health and medical institutions. The location of the first aid stations should be notified to each unit and the rally liaisons in advance, and their location should be marked with clear symbols to avoid people getting sick and being unable to find medical personnel. Units with medical institutions (such as clinics) should form their own first aid teams and carry emergency medicines, which would be more convenient.

　　Fifth, the personnel of each unit participating in the parade should be determined in advance. On the evening before the parade, they should collectively or separately prepare some dry food, such as steamed buns, pancakes, corn bread, and radishes, etc., but not too much, just enough to eat.

　　Sixth, the personnel of each unit carrying large banners, slogans, and portraits of leaders should not be too few to avoid being overburdened. It is best to find a few more strong people to take turns carrying them. Along the way, when shouting slogans, it is also best to select a few people with loud voices to take turns leading everyone in shouting.

　　Seventh, when organizing the parade teams, each unit should preferably not allow people who are too old, physically weak, sick, or pregnant to participate. However, if the masses are very enthusiastic and determined to participate in such an unprecedented patriotic parade, do not forcibly prevent them, but should assign dedicated personnel to take care of them.

　　Eighth, the rural population is relatively scattered. In addition to paying attention to the above-mentioned relevant items, the departments responsible for preparing the demonstration parade should adopt the method of sub-area demonstration parades, with one district or several villages as a unit. The venue for each sub-area demonstration parade should be selected in a centrally located village. However, even in such a small area, it would still take too long for the parade team to walk through every village, and the masses would be too tired. Therefore, it is best to take the village where the venue is located as the center and delineate several routes. The masses who live on this route or not far from this route should hold demonstration parades along this route. When the teams from each village reach their own village, they should return home. In this way, roughly every village in this area will have a parade team passing through, and the masses will not have to walk too far. In addition, the expenses for mobilizing the masses to boil tea water should be reimbursed appropriately to avoid increasing the burden on farmers.

### “五一”示威游行应注意些什么？

　　“五一”示威游行应注意些什么？
    林洪
    即将到来的全国“五一”示威游行，规模很大，人数很多，因此，游行所需要的时间也就较长。为了使参加游行的群众不致于过度疲劳，始终保持饱满情绪，各地负责示威游行筹备工作的部门应注意下列几件事：
    第一、在示威游行大会上不要有很多人讲话，凡有讲话都要尽可能简要、明确，主要地是向到会群众说明抗美援朝、反对美国武装日本和保卫世界和平的意义，号召人民群众完成当前的任务。过去有些地方举行群众大会时，往往是各机关、团体的负责人都要讲话，凡有讲话又大都是长篇大论，结果弄得群众十分疲劳。这是须要注意避免的。
    第二、各大、中城市参加示威游行的人数很多，要把队伍全部集中到会场，需要相当长的时间。为了避免队伍向会场集中或在游行时发生交叉现象，以致耽误群众的时间，负责筹备工作的部门应在事前通知各单位在场内站立的地点，在什么时间，从什么方向进入会场，以及参加游行的路线，在那一个单位的前面和后面。在队伍向会场集中和出发游行的时候，更要有专人分工指挥各单位的队伍。事前还应将会场上和集合、游行线路上的障碍物予以清除，将会场守则发给各单位。各单位应及时向参加游行的群众传达，要大家注意遵守，以保持场内的良好秩序。各单位接到通知后，必须切实遵照规定，在指定时间，从指定路线到达会场；否则仍然容易造成队伍的交叉现象。此外，群众的队伍必须在开会前遵时集合到会场，但还应注意不要把队伍集合得太早，以免造成群众的疲劳，在游行时打不起精神。
    第三、群众的饮水是一个重要问题，必须有专人负责解决。一般城市可以有组织地动员会场附近和游行路线两旁的群众设立茶水站。装茶水的缸子要用盖子盖好，以免因饮水不洁，妨害大家的健康。同时还应根据会场内群众分布的情况，在适当地方设置足够的临时厕所。
    第四、在会场内和游行路线上，应在适当地点设立救护站，动员当地各卫生医疗机关共同组成。救护站所在地点，应事前通知各单位和大会联络员，并用鲜明符号标明其所在地，以免有人得病，找不到救护人员。凡有医疗机构（如医务所）的单位，都应自行组成救护小组，携带救急药品，这样就更方便些。
    第五、各单位参加游行的人应事先确定，在游行的前一天晚上，应集体或分别地准备好一些干粮，如馒头、烙饼、窝窝头及萝卜等，但不要太多，够吃就可以。
    第六、各单位抬巨幅旗帜、标语牌和领袖像的人员，不要太少，以免负担过重，最好多找几个力气大的人，轮流来抬。沿途呼口号，也最好挑选几个嗓音大的人轮流领导大家喊。
    第七、各单位在组织游行队伍时，最好不要让年纪过大、身体过弱的人和病人、孕妇参加。但如因群众的热情很高，定要参加这样空前盛大的爱国游行，也不要勉强制止，而应派定专人负责照顾。
    第八、农村人口较分散，负责筹备示威游行的部门除应注意上述有关各条外，应以一个区或几条村为单位，再采取分片示威游行的办法。每一片的示威游行大会的会场应选择在地点适中的村庄。但就是在这样一片小的地区内，要让游行队伍走遍每一村庄，所需要的时间也还太长，群众会太疲劳，因此最好以会场所在的村庄为中心，划定几条路线，凡是居住在这一条路线上或距离这一条路线不远的村庄的群众，都沿着这一条路线举行示威游行，各村的队伍到达自己所住的村庄时就各自回家。这样作，大致可以使这一片地区内的每一村庄都有游行队伍经过，而群众也不要走太远的路。此外，动员群众烧茶水的费用，要酌量偿付，以免加重农民的负担。
