　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 18th—China's third batch of rice, totaling 9,200 tons, shipped to India under the Sino-Indian barter agreement, arrived at Madras Port on March 16th. To date, the total amount of rice shipped by China to India has reached 22,300 tons. In the first half of April, People's China will ship two more batches of rice, totaling 11,500 tons, to India.

　　The rice shipped from China to India has been allocated by the Indian government to New Delhi, Bihar Province (where there is famine in the northern part), Assam Province (which suffered floods and earthquakes in the second half of last year), Madras Province (where some cities, especially rural areas, are in a state of near-famine), and Hyderabad Province. In Delhi, Chinese rice has already begun to be rationed by Indian government ration shops. The Indian people are very grateful to People's China for shipping rice to India. They are very satisfied with the quality and low price of Chinese rice. The manager of a rationing shop in the Indian capital said, "Chinese rice is of good quality and the price is the cheapest." He said that the price of Indian rice six months ago was 27 rupees per maund (one maund equals 37.3 kilograms); but the price of Chinese rice is only 17 rupees per maund.

　　我国第三批大米抵印
　  印度政府已开始配售
    【新华社新德里十八日电】我国按照中印换货合同运到印度的第三批大米九千二百吨，已于三月十六日到达马德拉斯港。到现在为止，中国运到印度的大米总数已达二万二千三百吨。四月上半月中，人民中国将再运两批共计一万一千五百吨的大米到印度。
    由中国运到印度的大米，已由印度政府分配到新德里、比哈尔省（该省北部有饥荒）、阿萨密省（该省去年下半年发生水灾和地震）、马德拉斯省（该省若干城市、特别是乡村，处于近饥荒的状态）及海德拉巴省等地。在德里，中国大米已由印度政府的配售商店开始配售。印度人民对人民中国运米到印度非常感激。他们对中国大米物美价廉都非常满意。印度首都配售商店的经理说：“中国大米品质既好，价钱又最便宜。”他说：印度大米六个月以前的价格每芒德（一芒德合三七点三公斤）为二十七卢比；但中国的大米的价格每芒德仅只十七卢比。
