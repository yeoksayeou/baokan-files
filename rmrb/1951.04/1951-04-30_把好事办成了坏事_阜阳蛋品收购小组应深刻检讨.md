Turning a Good Deed into a Bad One
Fuyang Egg Purchasing Group Should Conduct a Thorough Self-Criticism

To the Editor:

I believe the work attitude of the Fuyang Egg Purchasing Group in the Anhui North District deserves a thorough self-criticism. To help disaster victims in the Fuyang area of northern Anhui (which suffered from flooding last year) sell their eggs at reasonable prices, the Bengbu branch of the China Egg Products Company specifically established a purchasing group in Fuyang this February. However, due to the small number of staff in the group and the slow pace of work, the supply of boxes for packing the eggs could not keep up, resulting in untimely purchases. Everyday, sellers of eggs crowded half the street, making it difficult for pedestrians to pass, yet the eggs could not be sold. On March 20th, there were nearly 500 shoulder-pole loads of eggs for sale. Some farmers came from more than 200 *li* away and waited for more than half a month. The dry rations they brought were long gone. They couldn’t afford to stay in a hotel at night, so they slept on stone benches in the open air, and some even fell ill from the cold. When some people arrived, the price of eggs was 2,700 yuan per *jin*, but after more than ten days, the price had fallen to 2,000 yuan, and the eggs still had not been sold. They wasted time and lost money on food and drink. Some disaster victims originally used government loans to sell eggs as a sideline production, but after waiting for the eggs to drop in price, they couldn’t even sell them for enough to cover their costs. Liu Gongjun, a farmer from Xutang District, Fuyang County, who came to sell eggs, even contemplated suicide because of this.

The staff of the purchasing group lacked a mass perspective and did not consider how to solve the above-mentioned serious situation and the difficulties of the masses. If the number of staff in the purchasing group was too small and the packing materials were insufficient, they should have promptly requested instructions from their superiors to find a solution. If the superiors could not solve the problem for the time being, they should have changed the purchasing method or temporarily suspended the purchase. However, the staff of the purchasing group did not do this. They also did not explain the actual difficulties in their work to the masses well, but instead scolded the egg sellers with harsh words, kicked their loads, and broke the eggs. The masses are extremely dissatisfied with this. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will help the purchasing group conduct a thorough self-criticism and let them admit their mistakes and apologize to the masses.

Editor's Note: The establishment of the purchasing group in Fuyang by the Bengbu branch of the China Egg Products Company was originally a good thing to help disaster victims sell their sideline products. However, because the purchasing staff lacked a mass perspective, were perfunctory in their work, and only knew how to simply and passively carry out their tasks, without actively trying to solve the difficulties in their work and without explaining the situation well to the masses, the results were contrary to expectations, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. The purchasing group should conduct a thorough self-criticism on this.

### 把好事办成了坏事  阜阳蛋品收购小组应深刻检讨

　　把好事办成了坏事
    阜阳蛋品收购小组应深刻检讨编辑同志：
    我认为皖北阜阳蛋品收购小组的工作态度值得深刻检讨。中国蛋品公司蚌埠分公司为了帮皖北区阜阳一带灾民（去年该地区遭水灾）以合理价格销出鸡蛋，今年二月特在阜阳设立了收购小组。但因该组人员少，工作慢，装鸡蛋的箱子供应不上，以致收购不及时。卖鸡蛋的人每天都拥满了半条街，行人都通不过，可是鸡蛋却卖不出去。三月二十日那天，卖鸡蛋的担子，近五百付之多。有的农民从附近二百多里地赶来，等了半个多月，带来的干粮早吃光了，夜间住不起店，就宿在露天的石凳上，并有被冻病的。有的人来时，鸡蛋牌价是二千七百元一斤，过了十几天，价钱已落到二千元，鸡蛋还没有卖出去。他们浪费了时间，赔上了吃喝，有的灾民原来是用政府的贷款来贩卖鸡蛋进行副业生产的，等的鸡蛋跌了价，还卖不够本钱。阜阳县许堂区来卖鸡蛋的农民刘公俊，竟因此要寻短见。
    收购组的工作人员，太缺乏群众观点，对上述严重情况和群众的困难，不考虑如何解决。如果收购组的人员过少，装箱器材不够用，就应该迅速请示上级想办法；如果上级一时解决不了，也应该改变收购的办法或暂时停止收购。而收购组的人员却未这样作。他们也不把工作中的实际困难，很好地向群众进行解释，反而向卖鸡蛋的人发脾气，厉声厉色，踢人的挑子把鸡蛋打破。群众对此极为不满。希望有关机关帮助该收购组进行深刻检讨，并让他们向群众认错、道歉。
          袁明甫
    编者按：中国蛋品公司蚌埠分公司在阜阳设立收购小组，本来是帮助灾民推销副产品的一件好事；但由于收购人员缺少群众观点，对工作敷衍塞责，只知简单地、被动地去执行任务，不积极设法解决工作中的困难，不很好地向群众进行解释，以致事与愿违，引起群众不满。收购组对此应进行深刻检讨。
