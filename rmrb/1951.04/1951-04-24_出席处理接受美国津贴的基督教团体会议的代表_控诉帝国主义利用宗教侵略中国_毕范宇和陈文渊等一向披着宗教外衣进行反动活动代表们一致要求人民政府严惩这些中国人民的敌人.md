Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: The representatives attending the meeting on handling Christian organizations receiving U.S. subsidies, after listening to the reports by Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council Guo Moruo, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee Lu Dingyi, and Deputy Secretary-General Shao Quanlin, and after group discussions on the 17th and 18th, have gained a clearer understanding of the crimes of U.S. imperialism in using religion to invade China, and have deeply realized how U.S. imperialism has long used the church and Chinese scum within the church as tools of aggression. At the plenary sessions on the 19th and 20th, the representatives conducted impassioned denunciations of imperialist elements and scum within the church.

　　During the two-day conference, eighteen representatives took the stage to speak, accusing the notorious U.S. imperialist elements Bi Fanyu, Li Timothy, Luo Aihua, and Chinese Christian scum Chen Wenyuan, Liang Xiaochu, Gu Ren'en, Zhu Youyu, etc. All representatives unanimously demanded that the People's Government severely punish these enemies of the Chinese people!

　　First to be accused was Bi Fanyu, the U.S. imperialist element and former Rural Affairs Secretary of the National Christian Council of China. Those who accused him were: Cui Xianxiang, General Secretary of the National General Council of the Church of Christ in China; Shao Jingsan, General Secretary of the Nanjing Church of Christ in China; Shen Derong, Editor-in-Chief of the Tian Feng Journal; Shi Zhongyi, Secretary of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Christian Rural Service Federation; and Shi Ruzhang, Director of the Student Department of the National Association of the Young Women's Christian Association of China. They accused Bi Fanyu of engaging in activities to invade China for U.S. imperialism under the guise of religion. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Bi Fanyu served as an advisor to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and to the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the pseudo-Military Commission, a special agent organ of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and presided over the Chongqing Translator Training Class. He had close ties with the U.S. State Department. In 1946, he was one of the three people recommended by Marshall to serve as ambassador to China. He and U.S. Army Colonel Schriefer stationed in China jointly drafted a secret "Chinese Social Education Plan" for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, attempting to use American money to implement extremely vicious enslavement education in China. In the plan, he boasted that if this plan were implemented, it could break the Chinese people's faith in the Chinese Communist Party. His plan was revised by Marshall and sent to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. In 1948, he wrote a book called "China: Twilight or Dawn?" In this book, he fabricated many rumors, insulted the Chinese people's liberation war and the Communist Party, and did his best to support the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. In the book, he portrayed Chiang Kai-shek as China's Washington. Before the liberation of Nanjing, he spread rumors everywhere, saying: When the Communist Party comes, there will be no religious freedom. The facts exposed his rumors, as Shao Jingsan said at the accusation meeting: "After liberation, the bells of our church can still be heard every day." Bi Fanyu also wrote a pamphlet called "Home," in which he attempted to use religion to instill anti-communist and anti-people ideas into Christian families. Before the liberation of Nanjing, he asked some Christians to flee to Taiwan, saying that the United States would not give up Taiwan. After liberation, he himself stayed in Shanghai to continue manipulating and disrupting the activities of the Chinese church. But Bi Fanyu suffered a final and shameful defeat this time. Cui Xianxiang said angrily during the accusation: "In the past, we were poisoned by imperialism and were fooled by them. But today, the Chinese people have stood up, and the Chinese church has also stood up. We must forever and completely sever our relationship with imperialism and establish our own church for the Chinese people."

　　Jiang Changchuan, Bishop of the North China District of the Methodist Church in China, and Li Muqun, pastor of the Chongqing Lutheran Church, accused Chen Wenyuan, the scum of Chinese Christians and the heinous counter-revolutionary. They revealed Chen Wenyuan's counter-revolutionary crimes: he once served as a representative of the pseudo-National Assembly and had extremely close relations with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. He went to the United States several times, asking the U.S. government to help Chiang Kai-shek massacre the Chinese people. After liberation, he still refused to repent and refused to register as a member of the reactionary party and organization. He installed a military radio station in his home and deployed special agents in various units affiliated with the Methodist Church, plotting to sabotage the People's Government. Recently, the People's Government's public security organs captured thirteen special agents within the West China Methodist Church, all of whom were personally arranged by Chen Wenyuan. This U.S. agent has been arrested by our People's Public Security Organs in Shanghai. After the accusation, Jiang Changchuan reviewed his mistake of not reporting this counter-revolutionary element in time. He said passionately: "I am determined to rectify our church with the spirit of putting righteousness before family. For elements like Chen Wenyuan, we will eliminate one if there is one, and ten if there are ten. We must thoroughly clean them up!" The entire audience welcomed his determination with warm applause.

　　Jiang Wenhan, Deputy General Secretary of the National Association of Young Men's Christian Associations of China, exposed the conspiratorial activities of the World Alliance of YMCAs under the control of U.S. imperialism, and at the same time made a just accusation against Liang Xiaochu, the former General Secretary of the Chinese YMCA. In order to please his American masters, Liang Xiaochu completely Americanized the YMCA, creating the shameful phenomenon of taking pride in speaking English, eating Western food, and using English records and reports within the YMCA. When Shanghai was about to be liberated, Liang Xiaochu left his post and went to Hong Kong, serving as the Asian Regional Secretary of the "World Alliance of YMCAs" controlled by U.S. imperialism, attempting to establish a base in Southeast Asia to oppose the new China for U.S. imperialism. He was one of the hosts of the "Southeast Asian Christian Conference" held in Bangkok in November 1949 with the central theme of "opposing communism." He constantly made absurd remarks abroad, even slandering our great motherland as "Chinese imperialism." Jiang Wenhan said sadly: "Liang Xiaochu is no longer Chinese!" He, on behalf of the Chinese YMCA, guaranteed that from now on, they would resolutely sever all relations with U.S. imperialism and its running dog Liang Xiaochu, and thoroughly rectify the organization of the YMCA.

　　Gu Ren'en, the U.S. imperialist spy who has been arrested by our Public Security Bureau, was unanimously spurned by all representatives. Wang Chongsheng, Wang Zhikun, Xie Songsan, Niu Zhifang, and Qiao Weixiong, representatives of Christian organizations from Qingdao, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Tianjin, extremely angrily exposed his crimes in the above four places. The Executive Chairman of the conference read aloud a letter from a Christian, Yang Shaopeng, accusing Gu Ren'en, which was published in the People's Daily on the same day (20th). The letter accused Gu Ren'en of raping his daughter, Yang Xiuying, six years ago, causing her to become mentally disordered and insane, and she is still locked in bed. This outrageous Christian scum aroused the anger of all representatives. When Wang Chongsheng angrily asked on the stage "Should Gu Ren'en be killed or not," the audience immediately roared: "Kill! Kill!"

　　Bishop Chen Jianzhen, Chairman of the House of Bishops of the Chinese Anglican Church, exposed the crimes of Zhu Youyu, another bishop of the church, who colluded with U.S. imperialism to harm the interests of the people. Zhu Youyu once worked with Chen Wenyuan in the "Three People's Principles Youth League" and trained special agents for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. In July 1950, he participated in the Central Committee meeting of the "World Council of Churches," one of the tools of U.S. imperialist aggression, held in Canada. This meeting passed a reactionary resolution supporting the U.S. aggression in Korea and opposing the Stockholm Declaration banning atomic weapons. From this, it can be seen that he is a national scum with no conscience, wholeheartedly following U.S. imperialism.

　　In addition, Hu Yiyun, General Secretary of the Guangdong Christian Council, accused Luo Aihua, an American missionary spy who had lived in Guangzhou for more than 30 years, and Hu Zuyin, Honorary General Secretary of the Guang Xuehui, accused Li Timothy, the famous U.S. imperialist agent of the association. Wang Zizhong, General Secretary of the North China Christian Federation, and Chen Chonggui, President of the Chongqing Theological Seminary, also angrily accused U.S. imperialism of using religion to carry out aggression.

　　In their accusations, the representatives also conducted sincere self-criticism. Chen Chonggui said: "Why do we accuse and report scum like Chen Wenyuan and Gu Ren'en only after the government arrests them based on conclusive evidence, instead of accusing and reporting them earlier? This is a shame for all of us, and we should admit our mistakes." The representatives unanimously stated that after returning, they would hold accusation meetings extensively, strengthen the political study of church members, and resolutely eliminate the spies and special agents lurking inside the church.

(Editor's note: The accusation speeches of the above representatives will be published on pages five and six of tomorrow's newspaper.)

　　出席处理接受美国津贴的基督教团体会议的代表
　  控诉帝国主义利用宗教侵略中国
　  毕范宇和陈文渊等一向披着宗教外衣进行反动活动代表们一致要求人民政府严惩这些中国人民的敌人
    【新华社二十一日讯】出席处理接受美国津贴的基督教团体会议的全体代表，在听了政务院副总理郭沫若、文教委员会副主任陆定一、副秘书长邵荃麟的报告，并经过了十七、十八两天的小组讨论以后，他们对于美帝国主义利用宗教侵略中国的罪恶，开始有了更明确的认识，并且深切地觉悟到长期以来美帝国主义是如何利用教会及教会中的中国败类作为侵略的工具。在十九、二十两日的大会上，代表们对教会中的帝国主义分子及败类进行了激愤的控诉。
    在两天大会上，有十八位代表登台发言，他们控诉了臭名昭著的美帝国主义分子毕范宇、李提摩太、骆爱华和中国基督教徒败类陈文渊、梁小初、顾仁恩、朱友渔等。全体代表一致要求人民政府严厉惩办这些中国人民的敌人！
    首先被提出控诉的是美帝国主义分子前中华基督教总会乡村事工干事毕范宇。控诉他的人有：中华基督教会全国总会总干事崔宪详、南京中华基督教会总干事邵镜三、天风周刊总编辑沈德溶、江浙基督教乡村服务联合会干事施中一、中华基督教女青年会全国协会学生部主任干事施如璋。他们控诉毕范宇披着宗教外衣，实际上从事美帝国主义侵略中国的活动。毕范宇在抗战期间曾作过蒋匪介石的顾问，和蒋匪特务机关伪军事委员会外事局的顾问，主持重庆翻译员训练班。他和美国国务院有密切的关系。一九四六年马歇尔推荐担任驻华大使的三个人中，就有他一个。他曾经和美国驻华的陆军上校史瑞夫共同为蒋匪草拟了一个秘密的“中国社会教育计划”，企图用美国的钱在中国实施极其狠毒的奴化教育。他在计划中自诩如果这个计划实现后即可打破中国人民对中国共产党的信仰。他的这个计划曾经过马歇尔修正，送交给蒋匪。一九四八年他写了一本书，叫做《中国是黄昏还是黎明？》在这本书里，他捏造了许多谣言，污辱中国人民的解放战争和共产党，并竭力为蒋匪捧场。他在书中把蒋匪介石说成是中国的华盛顿。南京解放前他到处散布谣言，说：共产党来了，宗教是没有自由的。事实揭穿了他的谣言，正如邵镜三在控诉会上说的：“解放后，我们教堂的钟声还是每天可以听到。”毕范宇还写过一本小册子叫做《家》，他企图利用宗教把反共、反人民的思想灌输到基督教徒家庭中去。南京解放前，他要一些教徒往台湾跑，他说美国是不放弃台湾的。解放后他自己却一直留在上海继续作操纵和破坏中国教会的活动。但是毕范宇这一次却遭到了最后的可耻的失败。崔宪详在控诉时愤怒地说：“过去我们受了帝国主义的毒害，上了他们的当。但今天中国人民站起来了，中国的教会也站起来了，我们要永远地、彻底地割断与帝国主义的关系，建立起中国人民自己的教会。”
    中华基督教卫理公会华北教区会督江长川、重庆路德会牧师李牧群控诉了中国基督教徒的败类、罪大恶极的反革命分子陈文渊。他们揭露了陈文渊的反革命罪行：他曾任伪国大代表，与蒋匪的关系极为亲密。他曾几次去美国，要求美国政府帮助蒋介石屠杀中国人民。解放以后，仍怙恶不悛，拒绝办理反动党团分子的登记。他在家中装置军用无线电台，并在卫理公会所属各单位布置特务分子，阴谋对人民政府进行破坏。最近人民政府公安机关在华西卫理公会内捕获了十三名特务分子，他们都是由陈文渊亲手布置的。这个美国特务已被我人民公安机关在上海逮捕。江长川在控诉以后，检讨了自己没有及时检举这个反革命分子的错误。他激昂地说：“我决定以大义灭亲的精神来整顿我们的教会，对于陈文渊这样的分子，有一个除一个，有十个除十个，一定要彻底加以清洗！”全场代表以热烈的掌声欢迎他的决心。
    中华基督教青年会全国协会副总干事江文汉揭穿青年会世界协会在美帝国主义控制下的阴谋活动，同时对于中国青年会前总干事梁小初提出正义的控诉。梁小初为了奉承其美国主子，使青年会完全美化，在青年会内造成了以说英语、吃西餐、用英文记录和写报告为荣的可耻现象。上海快要解放的时候，梁小初离职去香港，担任美帝国主义控制的“基督教青年会世界协会”亚洲区干事，企图为美帝国主义在东南亚建立反对新中国的据点。一九四九年十一月在曼谷举行的以“反对共产主义”为中心议题的“东南亚基督教会议”，他是主持人之一。他在国外不断地发表荒谬的言论，甚至诽谤我们伟大的祖国为“中国帝国主义”。江文汉沉痛地说：“梁小初已经不是中国人了！”他代表中国基督教青年会保证今后坚决斩断与美帝国主义及其走狗梁小初的一切关系，并彻底整顿青年会的组织。
    已被我公安局逮捕的美帝国主义间谍分子顾仁恩，被全体代表一致唾弃。来自青岛、上海、杭州、天津四地的基督教团体代表王重生、王志坤、谢颂三、钮志芳和乔维熊极度愤慨地揭发了他在上述四地的罪行。大会执行主席在会上宣读了当天（二十日）人民日报所刊载的一封基督教徒杨绍彭控诉顾仁恩的信，信内控诉顾仁恩在六年前强奸了他的女儿杨秀英，使她神经失常而致发疯，至今还被锁在床上。这个伤天害理的基督教败类，激起了全体代表的愤怒。当王重生在台上激愤地问“顾仁恩该杀不该杀”时，台下立刻发出了怒吼：“该杀！该杀！”
    中华圣公会主教院主席主教陈见真揭发了该会另一个主教朱友渔勾结美帝国主义危害人民利益的罪行。朱友渔曾和陈文渊一道在“三民主义青年团”做过工作，为蒋匪训练特务。一九五○年七月，他参加美帝国主义侵略工具之一的“世界基督教协进会”在加拿大召开的中央委员会议，这个会议曾通过了一个支持美国在朝鲜的侵略行动和反对斯德哥尔摩禁止原子武器的宣言的反动决议，由此可见，他是一个毫无心肝的一心追随美帝国主义的民族败类。
    此外，尚有广东基督教协进会总干事胡翼云控诉了在广州居住达三十多年的美国传教士间谍分子骆爱华，广学会义务总干事胡祖荫控诉了该会著名的美帝国主义代理人李提摩太。华北基督教联合会总干事王梓仲和重庆神学院院长陈崇桂也都愤慨地控诉了美帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略的罪恶。
    各代表在控诉中，同时进行了诚恳的自我检讨。陈崇桂说：“像陈文渊、顾仁恩这种败类，我们为什么到政府根据确切罪证逮捕了他们以后，再来进行控诉，而不早一点控诉、检举他们呢？这是我们大家的羞耻，我们应该认错。”代表们一致表示回去以后，将普遍地举行控诉会，加强教徒的政治学习，坚决地肃清潜伏在教会内部的间谍、特务分子。
    （编者按：上述各位代表的控诉词，将于明日本报第五、六版刊出。）
