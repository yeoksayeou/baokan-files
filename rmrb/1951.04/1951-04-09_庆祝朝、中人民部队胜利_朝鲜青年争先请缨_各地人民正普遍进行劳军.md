　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th -- The great victories of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies on the front lines in continuously annihilating the enemy's active forces are inspiring the people in the liberated areas of Korea, making them participate in the great war of liberating the motherland with even more active actions. Thousands of workers and students have voluntarily signed up for the army, expressing their determination to fight for the liberation of the entire territory of the motherland. Youth in thirteen villages, including Sadong-ri in Pyongyang, have been holding mobilization meetings for days. In the enthusiastic atmosphere of celebrating the victory on the front lines, young people are vying to volunteer to kill the enemy. Zhao Jing-shi, a young farmer from Linheung-ri in the northern suburbs of Pyongyang, denounced the inhuman and bloody atrocities of the American bandits at a mobilization meeting and then swore: "I am a member of the Korean Workers' Party. Today's war determines the fate of my Korean nation. I am determined to take up arms and go to the front line, and I hope everyone will follow me!" Dozens of young people signed up for the army on the spot.
