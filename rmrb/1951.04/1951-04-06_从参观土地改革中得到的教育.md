　　Education Gained from Visiting Land Reform
    Professor of Beijing Normal University, Ma Te
  I. Deepened hatred for the feudal exploitation system and drew closer to the peasants emotionally.
    Intellectuals are accustomed to considering issues rationally, with little emotional experience, which often leads to deviations. For example, regarding the feudal exploitation system, although theoretically it is admitted that it must be abolished, it is only an abstract understanding. Especially regarding how the landlord class oppressed the peasants and caused heinous crimes through this system, the understanding is not specific enough, even very vague, and some things are even half-believed. For example, the scene in the movie "Shepherd's Song of Northern Shaanxi" where the landlord hangs and beats the hired worker, if we hadn't gone to the countryside to see it, we might have thought that this was at most an individual case, not a universal phenomenon. This time we had the opportunity to go to the countryside to see that there are indeed many things that cannot be seen in books, or that are not seen clearly or specifically enough even when seen.
    I once heard the saying "There is no feudalism in Jiangnan," the "reason" being: the landlord owns the land base, and the peasant owns the land surface. After going to the countryside to see it, we know that this statement is a deception. In fact, we only need to ask this question: Do peasants pay rent to landlords, or do landlords pay rent to peasants? This statement will be self-defeating. The truth is that the "separation" of land base and land surface is evidence of the Jiangnan landlords' cunning, deception, and trickery.
    In Xigang Township, Wujiang County, Southern Jiangsu, what we saw was: the so-called small rent land where peasants have no "land surface rights," peasants generally have to pay landlords eight dou of rice per mu as rent; the so-called large rent land where peasants have "land surface rights," peasants generally have to pay five dou of rice as rent. Eight dou is naturally somewhat different from five dou, but the land tax of large rent land is paid by the peasants, so the amount of exploitation is about the same as that of small rent land. Why do peasants tighten their belts and use the only food they save to buy this "land surface right"? The main reason is that they are afraid of the landlord withdrawing the tenancy. Landlords, in order to gain more profit, often threaten peasants with tenancy withdrawal, forcing peasants to use the food they need to survive to buy this "insurance" of "permanent tenancy" that has no guarantee. In fact, this "insurance" is just a trick played by the landlord class. Relying on political power, the landlord class can take back the land at any time. The common situation is that as soon as there is a disaster, and the peasants cannot pay the rent, the landlord can take back the land; and the landlord can obtain many additional exploitations in this transaction.
    In addition to "regular" exploitation, the landlord class would also create various pretexts to add exploitation on top of exploitation. For example, when the landlord Song Ziyu in Xigang Township was the puppet township head, he said he wanted to establish a self-defense force and forced the entire township to collect more than two hundred shi of gun rice. But after he received the gun rice, he put it all at home, ate and drank lavishly, and took a concubine for pleasure.
    The reason why the landlord class dared to act recklessly was mainly because they relied on their political power.
    In Nanku Township, just taking the thirty landlord households from the Henan gang as an example, two of them had served as commanders of the Kuomintang self-defense force, one as the head of the puppet security regiment, and four as puppet district chiefs. In the entire township, before liberation, there were twenty-three bandits, fourteen puppet military officers, eighteen Kuomintang members, seventy Three Youth League members, as well as plainclothes teams, self-defense forces, etc. After liberation, these forces were not severely hit and still lurked in grassroots organizations to carry out sabotage. For example, during the reorganization of the organization, it was discovered that among the village cadres, there were twenty-three Three Youth League members, one Kuomintang member, three landlords, two rich peasants, two puppet military officers, five puppet保长, fifteen puppet self-defense forces, five bandits, and one plainclothes team member. Among them, the landlord Ma Xiangsen, who was once the head of the Three Youth League, served as the head of the peasants' association group after liberation and requisitioned more than two thousand jin of grain, all of which fell into his own pocket. The puppet military officer Wei Rongkui also served as the head of the peasants' association group after liberation, raping women in the name of a cadre and releasing the puppet district chief.
    Xigang Township is not as prominent as this, but the situation is still similar. For example, the landlord Tang Guilin, who was recently executed, once served as the puppet township head, deputy commander of the self-defense regiment, Japanese military secret agent, and officer of the Kuomintang Loyal National Salvation Army. After liberation, he fled to Shanghai and sneaked back to Xigang in April 1950, plotting to organize the Fifth Detachment Special Agent Brigade of the Jiangnan Anti-Communist People's Self-Defense Army.
    Under the heavy exploitation and oppression of the landlord, official, bandit, enemy, puppet, and secret agent six-in-one, the peasants sighed from the bottom of their hearts:
    The peasants have two knives on their backs,
    Heavy rent and high interest;
    The peasants have three ways out,
    Escape, prison, or suicide.
    In Xigang Township, counting from several years before liberation, ninety-six peasant households were sued for failing to pay rent, fifteen died in prison as a result, two sold their children, eighty-two were deprived of their tenancy, and five cattle were forced to be sold. Among them, the landlord Xu Ziguang shot or beat six peasants to death, occupied the houses of two peasant households, five hundred mu of lake fields, and raped eleven women, one of whom died from an abortion.
    This is only a rough and far from complete picture of feudal exploitation and oppression in two townships. Facing this situation, I have been able to understand why land reform is a "systematic and fierce struggle." How difficult it is for the peasants to suppress their emotions when facing their class enemies with whom they have a sea of blood and deep hatred. In the past, I didn't understand it deeply enough, and I often made the mistake of not being able to reconcile emotions and reason. This visit to land reform not only made my rational understanding correspond to my perceptual understanding, but more importantly, through these perceptual understandings, I have deepened my hatred for the landlord class emotionally, and at the same time, I have moved closer to the peasants.
  II. From resigning to fate to class awakening, the peasants' thinking is very different from before.
    Due to the exploitation and oppression of the feudal system for thousands of years, the peasants' reason and emotions have generally been compressed. Run Tu in Lu Xun's "Hometown" is very representative of the typical peasant thinking before liberation: resigning to fate and placing one's hope on incense burners and candlesticks.
    Land reform is a great revolution for the landlord class, but it is an excellent education for the peasants. As the peasants themselves said: "Land reform not only turned us over, but also turned our hearts over."
    In Xigang Township, many peasants no longer believe in ghosts and gods. When asked why they don't believe in gods, the answer is straightforward: "The Bodhisattva and the landlord are one family. In the past, the landlord oppressed us, and the Bodhisattva never helped us. Now that we have turned over, why do we need the Bodhisattva?"
    On the boat from Pingwang Town to Xigang Township, we heard several peasant women from Xixi Township singing a song they composed, which can well illustrate the change in the peasants' thinking:
    Second Sister-in-law, Second Sister-in-law,
    There is something I don't understand:
    Good at calculating and hardworking,
    Is it ultimately bad luck?
    You are wrong, you are wrong,
    Fate is determined by oneself,
    Just because the rent is heavy and the interest is high,
    Now land reform is good for everyone.
    After the peasants went from the thought of resigning to fate to recognizing the root cause of their poverty today, their hatred for the landlord class is generally extremely strong, so they dare to openly expose the crimes of the landlord class. For example, Yu Longsheng, the hired worker of the landlord Zhuang Peide, openly exposed the fact that Zhuang Peide illegally distributed grain at the struggle meeting to recover the four major properties (referring to: houses, surplus grain, farming tools, and livestock), and even said the date, quantity, and location of the distribution clearly, making Zhuang Peide's wife (Zhuang himself had fled before the struggle, and only his wife was struggled against) unable to deny it. Afterwards, she said to her family, "They know everything!"
    For example, when struggling against the landlord Song Ziyu, an old lady exposed Song Ziyu's crimes in detail and in an organized manner, making many peasants present shed tears. Old ladies are generally very afraid of things. It is really not easy to dare to speak out what is in their hearts in such a public struggle occasion.
    After being educated by land reform, the peasants can generally unite and be considerate of each other, and their private ownership concept is very different from before. When the working cadres talk about policies, as long as they implement the idea of "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we should do this and that"; or the idea of "Peasants all over the world are one family," the peasants can accept it unconditionally.
    Xigang Township encountered a major difficulty when adjusting the land between villages: there was more land in the east and less land in the west, and the distance between east and west was more than ten miles, making it difficult to adjust. There were only two solutions: either the peasants move, and some of the peasants from the villages with less land move to the villages with more land; or re-adjust, and one township should be divided into two averages, one average for the villages in the east, and another average for the villages in the west. At that time, the working cadres were worried about this matter for several days and nights. During the discussion of this issue at the Peasants' Association Committee, the villages with more land first expressed their willingness to distribute the best houses and best land that were not received from the landlords to the peasants who moved from other villages; the village cadres with less land expressed their willingness to move there first, taking the lead, and being responsible for persuading the peasants. A major difficulty was quickly resolved.
    When Nanku Township was distributing the four major properties, individual peasants said: "It is easy to distribute land, but it is not easy to distribute the four major properties." "During the Kuomintang era, there would be fights even for a fish." But there were many vivid scenes during the distribution:
    For example, in one village, two cows were divided, one large and one small, one good and one bad. According to the general method, a lottery would be drawn to solve the problem. But the peasants did not do this. One peasant silently led away a small, bad cow, leaving a large, good one for others. Many peasants said: "It's a good distribution! Chairman Mao is blessed!"
    In another village, there were seven cows, and one had to be divided to another village. According to our thinking, it would be good to send the one left over after our own division to another village. But the peasants did not think so. They selected the best and largest one and solemnly sent it over with gongs and drums.
    Naturally, when distributing the four major properties and land, individual peasants were still inevitably dissatisfied, but this was quickly corrected by the peasants themselves. For example, at the group meeting of the Nanku Township Peasants' Representative Conference, one peasant expressed dissatisfaction with the house allocated to him. Immediately, a peasant corrected his mistake and said: "Houses do not grow crops. Productive labor can lead to wealth."
    In a land distribution group in Xigang Township, individual peasants expressed dissatisfaction with the land allocated to them, and they were quickly persuaded by the peasants themselves: "We didn't starve to death when we didn't have land in the past. Now that we have land, why do we still complain about whether it is good or bad!"
    Because the peasants have a high degree of class consciousness after land reform, they generally have a correct understanding of the need to resist US aggression and aid Korea in order to defend the fruits of victory. In Tongli Town, we participated in the district-wide celebration of the victory of land reform. The peasants came to the town from all directions, beating gongs and drums, dancing秧歌, and full of joy. After a period of complaining, a conscription upsurge immediately unfolded, and one hundred and five people signed up on the spot. Many peasants who joined the army said that being able to join the Chinese People's Liberation Army was their greatest honor. They said: "The Kuomintang couldn't catch conscripts. Joining the People's Liberation Army is more difficult than passing the imperial examination!" When asked why they wanted to join the Chinese People's Liberation Army, their opinion was: "The landlords will not give up. Only when Taiwan is liberated, Chiang Kai-shek is defeated, and American imperialism is driven away can the landlords give up."
  III. The cadres' policy thinking and work style also gave me great enlightenment.
    Intellectuals often have two incorrect views on policies: one is to understand policies abstractly, without understanding the profound content included in the policies; the other is to like to find the "deviations" of cadres, and cannot understand the so-called "deviations" from the cadres' standpoint.
    This time when we went down, we personally saw the responsible spirit and humble attitude of many cadres in implementing policies, which greatly moved us. I myself have imagined this: If I were also such a cadre, would I insist on the policy in every small matter without making mistakes?
    Examples are readily available.
    Zhang Xisheng, the chairman of the Peasants' Association in Nanku Township, distributed the landlord's two tents along with the beds to the peasants when distributing the four major properties. This matter quickly received a reaction. The landlord took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying: Nanku Township is in a complete mess, and even soft goods have been distributed. Zhang Xisheng felt that this matter was not good and brought it up for discussion at the cadre meeting. The meeting decided to return the two tents to the landlord, and Comrade Zhang also made a self-criticism at the Peasants' Representative Conference to draw everyone's attention and educate other cadres.
    On the one hand, it is policy thinking, and on the other hand, it is the mass line. Combined, it becomes the entire soul of cadre work.
    In Xigang Township, we once saw this situation: Comrade Hou Yuyi, a district-level cadre, and several comrades from the work team were simply like a family with the village cadres and the masses of peasants. The work team went out to work in the middle of the night, working there, eating there, and sleeping there. In Xigang Township, Comrade Hou Yuyi became the center of happiness for the masses of peasants. As soon as Comrade Hou arrived, even three-year-old children 친切called out his name. During the group discussions of the two Peasants' Representative Conferences, we saw Comrade Hou running from this group to that group, inspiring the masses to speak, listening to their opinions, and then, in his summary, he always grasped the ideological situation of the masses, repeatedly explaining the boundaries and depth of the policies, and timely pointing out the omissions that might occur. His concise and powerful words, like iron towers, were tightly rooted in the hearts of every peasant.
    In Xigang Township, when recovering the four major properties, some places did not consider the issue of recovering the dispersed grain before liberation carefully enough. Comrade Jin Peiyang, a county-level cadre who accompanied us on the visit at that time, saw this point. When inspecting the work, Comrade Jin guided the problem to the crux of the problem using the method of enlightenment and guidance, allowing the cadres to check where the problem occurred themselves, so that their own cadres felt that it was themselves who discovered the problem, not the superiors. This art moved everyone.
    The work style of the mass line, through the cadres' dissemination in actual work, quickly became common sense and habit for the masses of peasants. A peasant in Hexing Village, Xigang Township, was unwilling to draw good and bad land together during the land distribution. The group leader said he was selfish, but he retorted and said: It's just that you, the group leader, are not good. Why don't you let everyone speak? - The meaning is: It's not easy to deal with this matter with just the group leader alone. Wouldn't it be easier to let the masses deal with it!
    We, who are accustomed to doing research in houses and are not good at formulating our own teaching plans according to the needs of the masses, facing these vivid facts, know how to correct our work style.

　　从参观土地改革中得到的教育
    北京师范大学教授　马特
  一、加深了对封建剥削制度的仇恨，在情感上更靠拢了农民
    知识分子惯常从理性去考虑问题，很少感性的体验，往往容易发生偏差。例如，对于封建剥削制度，在理论上虽也承认必须废除，但也仅仅是一种抽象的理解。尤其是对于地主阶级怎样通过这种制度压迫农民造成滔天罪恶，懂得不够具体，甚至非常模糊，有的事情还会半信半疑。例如，电影《陕北牧歌》中地主吊打雇工的情形，要不是下乡去看看，也许会以为这至多是个别情形，不会是普遍的现象。这次我们有机会到乡下去看看，的确有许多事情是书本上看不到，或者是看到了也看得不够真切、不够具体的。
    曾经听到“江南无封建”的说法，“理由”是：地主有田底，农民有田面。这个说法，我们到乡下一看，就知道是个骗局。其实我们只要提出这样的问题：是农民向地主交租，还是地主向农民交租？这说法也就不攻自破了。事实的真相是：田底田面的“分家”，正是江南地主的狡猾、欺骗、和巧取豪夺的证据。
    在苏南吴江县溪港乡，我们所看到的情况是：农民没有“田面权”的所谓小租田，一般的每亩农民要交给地主租米八斗，有“田面权”的所谓大租田，一般的要交租米五斗。八斗与五斗自然有些区别，但大租田的地税却归农民缴，这样，剥削的分量，也就跟小租田差不多了。农民为什么要拉紧肚皮把节省下来的仅有粮食去买得这份“田面权”呢？主要也就是怕地主抽佃。地主为了利上加利，常常以抽佃恐吓农民，胁迫农民拿他们维持命根子的粮食去买这份并无任何保障的“永佃”的“保险”。事实上，这种“保险”只是地主阶级耍的花枪，地主阶级依仗政治势力，随时随地都可借口收田。普通的情形是：只要碰上灾荒，农民缴不起租米，地主就可以把田抽回；而地主在这一转手间，又可从中取得许多额外的剥削。
    地主阶级对于农民，除“正规的”剥削以外，还会巧立名目，剥削之上再加剥削。例如，溪港乡地主宋子瑜在任伪乡长时，说要成立自卫队，向全乡强迫收取枪米二百余石。但他收到枪米后，却全部放在家里，大吃大喝，娶小老婆作乐。
    地主阶级之所以敢于横行霸道，主要就是依仗他的政治势力。
    在南库乡，单就河南帮的三十户地主说，其中当过国民党自卫队司令的二人，伪保安团长一人，伪区长四人。全乡中，在解放前，有匪首二十三人，伪军官十四人，国民党员十八人，三青团员七十人，以及便衣队、自卫队等。解放后，这些势力并未受到严重的打击，仍然潜伏在基层组织中进行破坏。如整顿组织时，发现村干部中，竟有三青团员二十三人，国民党员一人，地主三人，富农二人，伪军官二人，伪保长五人，伪自卫队十五人，土匪五人，便衣队一人。其中地主马祥森，曾为三青团负责人，解放后任农民协会大组长，曾征粮二千多斤，全部落入自己的腰包。伪军官魏荣奎，在解放后亦任农民协会大组长，以干部名义强奸妇女，放走了伪区长。
    溪港乡没有这样突出，但情况还是大同小异。例如，最近枪决的地主唐桂林，曾任伪乡长，自卫团副团长，日本军密探，国民党忠义救国军军官。解放后逃往上海，又于一九五○年四月潜回溪港，阴谋组织江南反共人民自卫军第五支队特务大队。
    在地主、官、匪、敌、伪、特务，六位一体的重重剥削和压迫下，农民们从他们的心底发出这样的叹息：
    农民身上两把刀，
    租税重，利息高；
    农民出路有三条，
    一逃、二牢、三上吊。
    在溪港乡，从解放之前的若干年算起，农民因缴不起租米而吃官司的有九十六户，因而坐牢至死的十五名，出卖儿女的二户，被夺佃的八十二户，被迫卖牛五头。其中地主徐子光，曾枪杀或打死农民六人，霸占了两户农民的房子，五百亩湖田，强奸了十一个妇女，其中一人因打胎致死。
    这仅仅是两个乡封建剥削和封建压迫的大致而远不完备的情形。面对着这种情形，我已经能够理解，土地改革为什么是一场“系统的激烈的斗争”。农民们面对着他们血海深仇的阶级敌人，在情感上是如何的难于抑制。在过去，我是了解得不够深切，往往也就犯了情感和理智不能一致的毛病。这次参观土地改革，不但使我理性认识得与感性认识相印证，而更重要的是，通过这些感性认识，在情感上我已经加深了对地主阶级的仇恨，同时也就更靠拢了农民。
  二、从听天由命到阶级觉醒，农民的思想跟从前大不相同
    由于几千年的封建制度的剥削和压迫，农民的理智和情感，一般都被压缩了。鲁迅《故乡》中的闺土，很能代表解放前农民思想的典型：听天由命，把自己的希望寄托在香炉烛台上。
    土地改革对地主阶级是一个大革命，对农民却是绝好的教育。正如农民自己说的：“土地改革，不但使咱们翻了身，也使咱们翻了心。”
    在溪港乡，许多农民都不迷信鬼神了。问农民，为什么不信神了。回答是干脆利落：“菩萨和地主是一家，过去地主压迫咱们，菩萨从未帮过咱们的忙，现在咱们翻身了，还要菩萨干吗？”
    我们从平望镇到溪港乡的船上，听到溪西乡几个农民妇女唱着自己编的一首歌，这首歌很能说明农民思想情况的转变：
    二阿嫂，二阿嫂，
    有桩事情不明了：
    又会算，又勤劳，
    究竟看是命不好？
    你错了，你错了，
    命运本是自家定，
    只因租重利息高，
    现在土改大家好。
    农民们从听天由命的思想到今天认识了自己穷苦的根源以后，一般地对地主阶级的仇恨都异常强烈，因此也就敢于公开地揭发地主阶级的罪恶。例如，地主庄培德的雇工俞龙生，在追缴四大财产（指：房屋、余粮、农具、牲畜）的斗争大会上，就公开揭发庄培德不法分散粮食的事实，连日期、数量、分散的地点都说得清清楚楚，使得庄培德老婆（庄本人已于斗争前夕逃跑，仅仅斗争了他的老婆）无法抵赖。事后她对她家人说：“他们全都知道了！”
    又如，在斗争地主宋子瑜时，一个老太太把宋子瑜的罪恶，详详细细有条有理地揭发出来，使得在场的许多农民都流下了眼泪。老太太一般都是很怕事的，在这样公开斗争的场合，敢于说出自己心里的话，实在不是容易事。
    农民经过土地改革教育后，一般地都能团结互让，私有观念跟从前已大不相同。工作干部在讲政策时，只要把“在毛主席领导下，我们应该怎样怎样”；或把“天下农民是一家”的思想贯彻下去，农民就可无条件地接受。
    溪港乡在调整村与村之间的土地时，曾碰到一个大困难：东边地多，西边地少，东西相距十余里，不好调整。只有两个解决办法：要吗是农民搬家，少地的村的农民搬一部分到多地的村去；要吗是重新调整，一个乡要分成两种平均数，东边的村一种平均数，西边的村又一种平均数。当时工作干部为了这事几天几夜放心不下。在农民协会委员会上讨论这问题时，多地的村，首先表示愿意将没收到地主的最好房子和最好土地分给从别村搬来的农民；少地的村干部表示愿意自己首先搬过去，起带头作用，并负责说服农民。一个大困难很快就得到解决。
    南库乡在分配四大财产时，个别农民表示：“分土地容易，分四大财产可不简单。”“国民党时代分一条鱼都要打架。”但在分配时却有许多生动的场面：
    例如，有一个村，分两头牛，一大一小，一好一坏。照一般的办法，抽签解决。但农民却不这么办。一个农民不声不响地牵着一头小的坏的牛走了留下一头大的好的给别人。许多农民说：“分得好！毛主席有福！”
    另外一个村，有牛七头，须分一头给别一村。照我们想法，把自己分剩的一头送给别一村也就很好了。但农民却不这么想，他们挑选出长得最好最大的一头郑重其事地敲锣打鼓送过去。
    自然，在分配四大财产和土地时，个别农民不满意的地方仍然免不了，但很快就得到农民自己的纠正。例如，南库乡农民代表大会的小组会上，有一农民对分配给他的房子表示不满，马上有一个农民纠正了他的错误，说：“房子长不出庄稼来，生产劳动才能发家致富。”
    在溪港乡一个分田小组上，个别农民对分配给他的土地表示不满，很快地也得到农民自己的说服：“过去没有田都没有饿死，现在有了田，还嫌什么好坏！”
    由于农民经过土地改革后有高度的阶级觉悟，一般地对于保卫胜利果实必须抗美援朝都有正确的认识。在同里镇，我们参加了全区的庆祝土地改革胜利大会，农民们敲着锣鼓、扭着秧歌、喜气洋洋地从四面八方的乡村赶来镇上参加，经过一段诉苦后，立刻展开参军热潮，当场报名的就有一百零五名。许多参军的农民都表示，能够参加中国人民解放军是他们最大的光荣。他们说：“国民党抓丁抓不到，参加解放军比考秀才还难！”问他们为什么要参加中国人民解放军，他们的意见是：“地主不会死心，只有台湾解放了，蒋介石打垮了，美帝国主义赶走了，地主才能死心。”
  三、干部的政策思想和工作作风，同样给了我很大的启示
    知识分子对于政策经常有两种不正确的看法：一种是抽象地了解政策，不懂得政策所包括的深湛的内容；另一种是喜欢找干部的“偏差”，而不能从干部的立场去体会所谓“偏差”。
    这一次我们下去，亲眼看到许多干部执行政策的负责精神和虚心态度，使我们大大地感动。我自己曾经这样地设想：假使自己也做这样的一个干部，会不会在每一细小事情上都坚持政策，而不致于犯错误呢？
    例子是随手可拾的。
    南库乡的农民协会主任张锡生，在分配四大财产时，把地主的两顶帐子连同卧床分给了农民。这件事，很快地得到反应。地主乘机造谣说：南库乡乱得一团糟，连细软都给分了。张锡生感到这件事情不太妙，提到干部会议上讨论。会上决定将两顶帐子还给地主，张同志并在农民代表大会上作了自我检讨，借以引起大家注意和教育其他干部。
    一方面是政策思想，另方面是群众路线，结合起来，就成为干部工作的整个灵魂。
    在溪港乡，我们曾经看到这样情形：区级干部侯育义同志以及工作队几个同志，跟乡村干部和农民群众简直如同一家人。工作队半夜三更出去工作，工作在那里，就吃在那里，睡在那里。在溪港乡，侯育义同志成为农民群众快乐的中心，侯同志一到，连三岁的小孩都亲切地叫出他的名字来。在两次农民代表大会的小组讨论时，我们看到侯同志从这一个小组跑到那一个小组，启发群众发言，倾听他们的意见，然后在他总结的时候，总是抓住群众的思想情况，反复说明政策的界线和深度，及时地指出他们可能发生的疏忽。他的简明有力的话，像铁搭一样，紧紧地扎在每个农民的心上。
    溪港乡在追缴四大财产时，关于追缴解放前的分散粮食问题上，有些地方考虑得不够细致，当时陪同我们参观的县级干部金佩扬同志是看到了这点的。检查工作时，金同志用启发诱导的方法把问题引导到症结的所在，让干部自己去检查问题发生在什么地方，使自己干部感觉到发现问题的是自己而不是上级。这种艺术使我们每个人都感动了。
    群众路线的作风，通过干部在实际工作中的传播，很快地成为农民群众的常识和习惯、溪港乡合兴村一个农民在分田时不肯好田坏田搭搭配配抽出来，小组长说他自私，他却反唇相诘，说：就是你小组长一个人不好。为什么你不让大家来说话呢？——意思是：小组长一个人不好对付这件事，让群众对付不就好办！
    一向惯于关在房子里做研究工作的我们，不善于根据群众的要求来制定自己的教学计划的我们，面对着这些生动的事实，我们知道如何来修正我们的作风了。
