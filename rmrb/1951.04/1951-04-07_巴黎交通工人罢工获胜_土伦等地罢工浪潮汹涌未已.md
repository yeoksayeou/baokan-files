　　Paris Transportation Workers Win Strike
　  Strike Wave Surges in Toulon and Other Places

    【Xinhua News Agency, 6th】Paris dispatch: After persisting in a strike for nineteen days, Paris public transportation workers resumed work on the 4th because most of their demands were met. The powerful force they demonstrated during the strike has forced the government to agree to provide them with a monthly living allowance from April 1st, cancel sanctions against strikers, consider the issue of raising the minimum wage by 11.5 percent, and re-examine the pension issue for underground tram workers. However, the Central Strike Committee of Paris Public Transportation Workers announced: They will continue the struggle until all demands are met.
    Although the strike of Paris public transportation workers has come to an end, the wave of strikes throughout France continues unabated. 36,000 workers in naval arsenals in Paris, Toulon, and other places held a 24-hour strike on the 4th, demanding increased wages. On the same day, workers at the Brest Arsenal, who have been on strike since March 22nd, took to the streets with their wives and children to demonstrate. At the Port of La Pallice, which is managed by the U.S. military, dockworkers unanimously went on strike for 24 hours in support of wage increase demands. The Federation of Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Unions of the Paris region has also decided to hold a 24-hour warning strike. Workers at the "Cellophane" factory in Bezons have been on strike for several days.
    Under the pressure of continuing high prices, organizations of French civil service unions have stated that although the government has agreed to increase the salaries of low-paid personnel by 14.6 percent and high-paid personnel by 7.1 percent, it still cannot meet their demands.

　　巴黎交通工人罢工获胜
　  土伦等地罢工浪潮汹涌未已
    【新华社六日讯】巴黎消息：巴黎公共交通工人在坚持罢工十九天以后，因为大部分要求获得了满足，已于四日复工。他们在罢工中所表现的强大力量，已经迫使政府答应从四月一日起每月给他们生活津贴，取消对罢工者的制裁，考虑把最低工资提高百分之十一点五的问题，并且重新审查地下电车工人养老金的问题。但是，巴黎公共交通工人中央罢工委员会宣布：以后还要继续斗争，直到全部要求获得满足为止。
    巴黎公共交通工人的罢工虽然告一段落，但是，整个法国罢工的浪潮却依然汹涌未已。巴黎、土伦等地海军兵工厂的三万六千工人在四日举行了二十四小时罢工，要求增加工资。同日，从三月二十二日起就开始罢工的布勒斯特兵工厂工人，带着他们的妻子儿女一道到街上举行了示威。在美军管理下的拉巴利斯港，码头工人们为了支持增加工资的要求，一致罢工二十四小时。巴黎区邮电工会联合会也决定举行二十四小时的警告罢工。柏爽市“玻璃纸”工厂的工人已经罢工好几天了。
    在物价继续高涨的压力下，法国各公务员工会的组织已表示，政府虽然答应低薪人员加薪百分之十四点六，高薪人员加薪百分之七点一，但是仍然不能满足他们的要求。
