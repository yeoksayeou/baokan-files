    Xinhua News Agency, April 4th—The movement demanding an overall peace treaty and opposing rearmament is continuing to unfold in various parts of Japan.
    According to a United Press report: In Kanagawa Prefecture, thirty-four trade union groups held a meeting on March 2nd, deciding to expand the signature campaign demanding an overall peace treaty throughout the prefecture, and passed an emergency motion demanding that the Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the Socialist Party unite in struggle.
    The Japanese Communist Party’s Ehime Prefecture Committee has put forward slogans such as "Conclude an overall peace treaty guaranteeing Japan's independence and peace, oppose rearmament that leads to war," calling on various opposition parties to form a united front in local elections. The Shusangun branch of the Socialist Party in the prefecture has decided to unite with the Communist Party in struggle. In Yoshidahama, Matsuyama City, the prefecture is also brewing the establishment of a united front of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and progressive youth organizations.
    With the initiation of seven democratic groups and the mayor and deputy mayor, Gifu City held a symposium on the peace treaty issue on March 7th. Hirano Yoshitaro, director of the China Research Institute, opposed a separate peace treaty and rearmament in his speech, pointing out: "Rearmament will cause the military to take away our sons. Taxes will increase to an unbearable level." The meeting decided to launch an overall peace treaty movement.
    The small and medium-sized industrial associations and chambers of commerce in the Jonan area of Tokyo held two symposiums on the peace treaty issue at the end of February and the beginning of March, respectively. Hosokawa Kakuroku, a member of the Japanese Communist Party, attended and participated. The conclusion drawn from the symposium was: "Without an overall peace treaty, business will not prosper." The meeting also decided that all participants in the symposium would form a committee to promote an overall peace treaty and launch a signature campaign.

    【新华社四日讯】要求全面媾和与反对重新武装运动正在日本各地继续展开。
    据联合通讯社消息：在神奈川县，三十四个工会团体曾于三月二日举行会议，决定在全县扩大要求全面媾和的签名运动，并通过了要求共产党、劳农党与社会党联合斗争的紧急动议。
    日本共产党爱媛县委员会普提出“缔结保证日本独立与和平的全面和约，反对走向战争的重新武装”等口号，号召各在野党派在地方选举中结成统一战线。该县周桑郡社会党支部已决定与共产党联合斗争。该县松山市吉田滨，也在酝酿成立共产党、社会党与进步青年组织的统一战线。
    在七个民主团体与正副市长的发起之下，岐阜市于三月七日举行了媾和问题座谈会。中国研究所所长平野义太郎在发言时，反对单独媾和与重新武装，他指出：“重新武装将使军队把我们的儿子夺去。租税将增加到不堪负担的程度。”会中决定要展开全面媾和运动。
    东京城南地区中小工业会与商工俱乐部曾先后于二月底与三月初举行媾和问题座谈会两次，日本共产党参议员细川嘉六曾出席参加。座谈会得出的结论是：“如果没有全面和约，生意是不会兴旺的。”会中并决定由参加座谈会的全体人员组成促进全面媾和委员会，展开征集签名运动。
