　　Lessons from the Tunliu Massacre

　　The handling of the blood case in Tunliu County where a landlord murdered a farmer's entire family illustrates that within our Party, among our cadres, there are two distinctly different attitudes in implementing the Regulations for the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries. One is correct, represented by Zhang Qingkui, Junma, and Li Shuangsuo, members of the Miaoqiao Village Branch in Tunliu, and Wang Taikui and Shen Luming, Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the Tunliu County Party Committee. After the blood case occurred, Zhang Qingkui, Li Shuangsuo, and others immediately determined that this was a criminal act of the landlord's counterattack against the peasants and promptly reported to the higher Party committee for instructions on how to handle it. Shen Luming, Deputy Secretary of the Tunliu County Party Committee, clearly pointed out during the County Committee's discussion of the issue that this was a landlord's counterattack against the peasants and advocated the immediate arrest of the criminals. Wang Taikui, the County Party Secretary, also insisted on the policy of arresting the criminals after understanding the situation. In order to realize the Party's correct policy, these comrades also waged a resolute struggle against comrades who held incorrect attitudes on this issue.

　　The other attitude is completely the opposite, the erroneous attitude held by Yang Renhe (Party member), the Village Chief of Miaoqiao Village, Zheng Caifa (branch committee member), the Village Public Security Officer, Zhang Guangyu, the Deputy District Chief, Dong Chenglin, the District Party Secretary, Li Yongfu, a member of the Tunliu County Committee and County Head, and Jia Junying, Deputy Director of the Public Security Bureau. Yang Renhe and Zheng Caifa were negligent and not only failed to take precautions against or monitor the reactionary landlords, but even allowed the landlord to participate in the militia organization and even made him a squad leader. When the landlord launched a counterattack against the peasants, Yang Renhe lost his class stand and used torture to force the peasants to treat the landlord's injuries. When Li Fuchang's whole family was poisoned and requested a way to save them, Yang Renhe even thought, "This is a plague!" He even asked the murderer Cui Jinxi to take care of them, which gave the landlord the final opportunity to kill Li Fuchang's entire family. When the landlord Cui Chengzhuang felt guilty and showed fear, Yang Renhe comforted him: "Produce well, don't be afraid!" This politically extremely negligent phenomenon has reached an alarming degree.

　　Other cadres, including county-level cadres, were also very negligent. Especially Li Yongfu, as a member of the County Party Committee and County Head, failed to fulfill his due responsibility for this blood case and did not resolutely implement the County Committee's decision, delaying the arrest of the murderer Cui Chengzhuang and others for several months.

　　The former group of people should be commended. The latter group of people should be given appropriate punishments within the Party and administratively, according to the severity of their mistakes, in order to educate the entire Party and all staff members. In particular, Yang Renhe, in the face of such a sharp struggle, lost the class stand that a Communist Party member should have, shielded the landlord, and oppressed the peasants, and should be severely punished within the Party and should also receive due punishment administratively.

　　屯留血案的教训
    从屯留县处理地主杀害农民全家的血案中，说明了一个问题，即在我们党内，在我们干部中，在执行惩治反革命条例时，有两种截然不同的态度。一种是正确的，以屯留苗翘村支部委员张庆奎、骏马、李双锁和屯留县委书记王太奎、副书记申鲁明等为代表。张庆奎、李双锁等在这个血案发生之后，立刻判明这是不法地主向农民反攻的罪恶行动，及时报告上级党委请示处理办法。屯留县委副书记申鲁明，在县委会研究这一问题时，明确地指出了这是地主向农民的反攻，主张立即逮捕凶犯。县委书记王太奎在了解情况之后，也坚持逮捕凶犯的方针。为了实现党的正确的方针，这些同志并与对这一问题持错误态度的同志进行了坚决的斗争。
    另一种，是与此完全相反的态度，就是苗翘村村长杨仁合（党员）、村公安员郑财发（支部委员）、副区长张广玉、区委书记董成林、屯留县委委员、县长李永福，公安局副局长贾俊英等所持的错误态度。杨仁合、郑财发，麻痹大意，不但不对反动地主进行防范监视，甚至让地主参加了民兵组织，还让地主当了班长；当地主向农民反攻时，杨仁合竟丧失阶级立场，以吊打的办法强迫农民为地主养伤；当李福昌全家中毒，要求设法救治时，杨仁合还认为“这是瘟疫！”还叫凶犯崔进喜去照料，这就给予地主以最后杀死李福昌全家的机会；当地主崔成庄作贼心虚，表现恐惧时，杨仁合还安慰他：“好好生产，不要害怕！”这种政治上极端麻痹的现象，已到了惊人的地步。
    其他干部，包括县级干部在内，也非常麻痹。尤其是李永福，身为县委、县长，对这一血案始终没有负起应有的责任，不坚决执行县委决定，拖延数月之久始逮捕了杀人凶犯崔成庄等。
    前一种人，应受到表扬。后一种人，应当按照他们的错误的轻重，分别在党内和行政上给以应有的处分，以教育全党和所有工作人员。特别是杨仁合，在这样尖锐的斗争面前，丧失了共产党员应有的阶级立场，袒护地主，压迫农民，应受到党内严厉的处分，在行政上亦应受到应得的处分。
