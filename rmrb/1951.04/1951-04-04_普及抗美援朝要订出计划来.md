　　Since the China Peace Committee issued a circular on the 14th of last month, calling on the country to popularize and deepen the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, the national movement has had new developments. Today, the *People's Daily* publishes the "Decision on Popularizing and Deepening the Movement to Resist America, Aid Korea in Preparation for the May 1st Labor Day" and the "Plan for Popularizing and Deepening the Movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Welcoming the May 1st Grand Demonstration" promulgated by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, as well as the "Notice of the Tianjin Peace Committee on Responding to the Call of the General Association and Popularizing and Deepening the Movement to Resist America, Aid Korea Throughout the City." These indicate that the call of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the China Peace Committee to popularize the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea to every place and every person has begun to be implemented in some provinces and cities. In a large country like China with a population of nearly 500 million, mainly rural, it is impossible to complete this major political task in a short period without a concrete plan for popularizing education on Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea, and only conducting some fragmented and scattered propaganda work.
　　Like Shanxi and Tianjin, formulating a plan for popularizing and deepening the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and publicizing this plan, calling on all democratic parties, people's organizations, and people of all strata to strive together to realize this plan, is not a fragmented approach, but a concrete step to truly popularize the propaganda and education movement of Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea.
　　Based on existing experience, the following issues must be given special attention when formulating a popularization plan for Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea, in order to effectively guarantee the development of the movement.
　　First, there is the issue of understanding the propaganda and education movement of Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea. The reason why the movement has not been fully developed in some places or departments is that some comrades have not realized that the movement is the most important work in our national life at present and for a considerable period to come, and is an important driving force for all work. Failing to understand this, and treating the movement as an ordinary propaganda and education movement, or opposing the movement to other work, considering it an "extra burden" outside of regular work, is completely wrong. In fact, because of the movement, the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the land reform work in the new areas, and the national industrial and agricultural production work have all been greatly promoted. Without a deep understanding of this, the patriotic education of Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea cannot be carried out.
　　Second, the extent to which patriotic education of Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea has already been popularized in various places should not be overestimated. According to the sample survey materials of the Tianjin Peace Committee, in some small factories, about one-third of the people have not received or have not fully received education on Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea. Generally, small and medium-sized factories have not systematically carried out work for employees' families. In some middle schools, 20% to 30% of the faculty and staff are indifferent to Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea. Among residents, in streets with poor work, about 50% of the people have not been educated. According to the materials of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, even in places where the work of Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea has been done relatively well, the achievements are not yet consolidated. Although some cities and towns have held demonstrations and signed patriotic covenants, there is a tendency towards formalism. Especially in many rural areas, the political atmosphere is still relatively thin. Only a small number of women, who account for half of the population, have been mobilized. The reform and patriotic movement of the religious community is only just beginning, and in some places it has not yet begun. According to materials from other places, some rural cadres still have such thoughts: "We only care about the affairs of villages, districts, and counties, not international affairs." That is, they regard Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea as "foreign affairs" and do not understand that this is the primary struggle task of the Chinese people at present. For rural women, some places still have the view that "women are useless." All these facts remind us that we still need to do arduous work. If local authorities only see the positive aspects of existing achievements when making plans, and do not pay attention to the weak aspects of the work, it will hinder the progress of popularization.
　　Third, such a large-scale propaganda and education movement of Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea must pay attention to the method of combining key members with the masses, and be led by a certain organization, otherwise the movement will not be able to develop, or if it does develop, it will not be able to take root. Shanxi Province plans to mobilize all 50,000 cadres above the district level, 280,000 Communist Party members, and 180,000 Communist Youth League members to participate in this movement, and stipulates that each party and league member must guarantee to conduct propaganda and mobilization for ten people, and personally lead them to participate in the May 1st demonstration. This alone can guarantee that half of the 11 million people in Shanxi will participate in the ranks of Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea. Shanxi Province has also adopted some other effective measures. Tianjin plans to convene representative meetings of various people's organizations, districts, industries, and institutions to discuss and formulate plans, and mobilize and implement them level by level. Secondly, the city's teachers are organized, and then through the teachers, more than 90,000 students in the city's workers' spare-time schools and more than 200,000 students in universities, middle schools, and primary schools are mobilized to carry out propaganda to their surrounding employees, family members, and relatives and friends. Furthermore, each government agency, organization, factory, and school organizes small propaganda teams to conduct propaganda in small and medium-sized workshops and street residents under the principle of not hindering production. Citizen propaganda groups and other activists in each district conduct door-to-door visits to their streets and alleys. These methods are all effective ways to ensure that the movement penetrates into the masses. Local authorities should formulate methods that combine key members with the masses based on their specific circumstances. It must be pointed out here that the key members of the movement must include figures from all aspects such as democratic parties, industry and commerce, intellectuals, and religious circles, otherwise it will not be possible to create a broad patriotic camp. The China Peace Committee's April 1st notification to establish branch offices everywhere is an important guarantee for carrying out this movement.
　　Fourth, the propaganda of Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea should be combined with various central tasks in the local area to achieve twice the result with half the effort. At present, it should focus on combining with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the production movement, and in the new areas, it should be combined with land reform. The broad masses must understand the relationship between Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea and other tasks. For example, to ensure the victory of Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea, we must resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries. Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea is precisely to protect the safety of domestic industrial and agricultural production, and the development of industrial and agricultural production is an important condition for ensuring the victory of Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea. It is absolutely forbidden to promote Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea as a purely international current event, otherwise, it will greatly weaken the serious significance of "Resisting America and Aiding Korea" in order to "Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country." In rural areas, this is even more important. Propagandists who are divorced from the reality of rural areas are often regarded by farmers as people who "speak foreign languages." Such propaganda will not have any meaning. In terms of propaganda timing, various opportunities should also be used in combination. For example, schools in various places will soon have spring break. This is a good opportunity to use the holidays of faculty, staff, and students to carry out propaganda and education of Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea, and it should be used in a planned way.
　　Of course, the content of formulating a propaganda and education plan for Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea is not limited to these aspects, and there should be more appropriate content based on the different circumstances of each place. However, no matter what region, the leading organs should pay attention to checking on the movement. If no plan has been made, the current situation of the movement should be checked, the achievements and shortcomings should be estimated, and a practical plan should be formulated quickly. If a plan has already been made, the progress of the movement should also be checked at any time, and the deviations of the plan should be corrected in time to make the plan more correct and more effective. It is wrong not to make a plan and let things go; it is also wrong to think that everything is fine after a plan is made and not to check it.
　　Now, there is less than a month before the May 1st grand demonstration. All localities should carry out the work of Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea in an exceptionally planned manner, and strive to ensure that everyone in every place can receive the patriotic education of Resistance Against America, Aiding Korea before May 1st, or at the latest in late April, to prepare the ideological and organizational foundation for an unprecedented national large-scale demonstration.

### 普及抗美援朝要订出计划来

　　普及抗美援朝要订出计划来
    从上月十四日中国人民抗美援朝总会发出通告，号召全国普及与深入抗美援朝运动以来，全国抗美援朝运动已有新的开展。今天本报所发表的中国共产党山西省委员会所颁布的《为迎接五一劳动节，普及深入抗美援朝运动的决定》和《普及深入抗美援朝运动，迎接五一大示威计划》，以及《天津市抗美援朝会为响应总会号召并在全市普及深入抗美援朝运动的通告》，表示中共中央和抗美援朝总会关于把抗美援朝运动普及到每一处每一人的号召，在有些省市已经开始具体实施。在中国这样近五万万人口的以农村人口为主的大国，要求在短期内普及抗美援朝的教育，如果没有具体计划，而只是枝枝节节地零乱地作些宣传工作，是不可能完成这一重大政治任务的。
    照山西和天津那样，订出普及和深入抗美援朝运动的计划，并把这个计划公布，号召各民主党派、各人民团体、各阶层的群众，共同为实现这个计划而奋斗，这就不是枝枝节节的作法，而是使抗美援朝宣传教育运动真正普及的具体步骤。
    据已有的经验看来，订抗美援朝的普及计划时，必须特别注意下面一些问题，才能使运动的开展，得到有效的保证。
    首先，是对于抗美援朝宣传教育运动的认识问题。有些地方或者有些部门的抗美援朝运动之所以没有很充分地开展，就在于有些同志没有认识到抗美援朝运动是目前而且是今后相当时期内我们国家生活中最重大的工作，是一切工作的重要动力。不了解这一点，而把抗美援朝运动作为一个普通的宣传教育运动，或者把抗美援朝运动与其他工作对立起来，认为是经常工作之外一个“额外负担”。这是完全错误的。事实上，因为有了抗美援朝运动，无论镇压反革命的工作，新区的土地改革工作，以及全国的工农业生产工作，都因此得到了伟大的推动的力量。不深刻认识这一点，抗美援朝的爱国主义教育是不能开展起来的。
    第二，各地对于抗美援朝爱国主义教育已有的普及的程度，不能估计过高。据天津市抗美援朝会的抽查材料来看，没有受到或没有充分受到抗美援朝教育的人，在有些小工厂，还有三分之一左右。一般中小工厂，对职工家属均未有计划地进行工作。有的中学有百分之二十至三十的教职员对抗美援朝漠不关心。居民中，在工作较差的街道，还有百分之五十左右的人未受到教育。根据中国共产党山西省委员会的材料，在抗美援朝工作作得比较好的地方，成绩也还不巩固。有些城镇虽然进行过示威，订立过爱国公约，但存在着形式主义的偏向。特别在许多农村中，政治空气还是比较稀薄的。占人口半数的妇女只有少数动员起来了。宗教界的革新爱国运动还仅仅是开始，有些地方尚未开始。根据其他地方的材料，有些农村的干部还有这样的思想：“我们只管村际、区际、县际，不管国际。”就是他们把抗美援朝看成“外国的事”，而不了解这是中国人民目前首要的斗争任务。对于农村妇女，有些地方还有“娘儿们不顶事”的看法。所有这一些事实，都提醒我们还须作艰苦的工作。如果各地作计划时只看到已有的成绩的一方面，而不注意工作薄弱的方面，就会障碍普及工作的进行。
    第三，如此规模巨大的抗美援朝宣传教育运动，必须注意骨干和群众相结合的方法，并且由一定的组织把它领导起来，否则运动会开展不起来，或者开展起来了，不能生根。山西省计划全部动员区以上五万干部、二十八万共产党员和十八万青年团员，参加这一运动，又规定每一个党团员要保证向十个群众进行宣传和动员，并亲自带领他们参加五一示威游行。单单这一条，就可以保证全山西一千一百万人口的一半参加到抗美援朝的行列中来。山西省还采取了其他一些有效的办法。天津市计划由各人民团体、各区、各行业、各机构分别召开代表会议，讨论和制订计划，逐级动员贯彻执行。其次，把全市教员组织起来，然后通过教员把全市工人业余学校学生九万余人及大中小学校学生二十余万人动员起来，向自己周围的职工、家属、亲友等进行宣传。再其次，由各机关、团体、工厂、学校，分别组织小规模的宣传队，在不妨碍生产的原则下，分赴各中小作坊及街道居民中进行宣传。各区市民宣传小组及其他积极分子则向本街本胡同进行挨户访问。这些办法，都是保证运动深入到群众中去的有效方法。各地应根据自己的具体情况，订出使骨干和群众相结合的方法。这里必须指出：运动的骨干必须包括各民主党派、工商界、知识分子、宗教界等各方面的人物，否则不能造成广阔的爱国主义的阵营。四月一日中国人民抗美援朝总会通知各地普遍建立分会，这是开展这一运动的重要保证。
    第四，抗美援朝的宣传，应当和当地的各种中心工作相结合，才能收到事半功倍的效果。在目前应当着重与镇压反革命和生产运动相结合，在新区应与土地改革相结合。必须使广大群众明白抗美援朝和其他各项工作的关系。例如要保证抗美援朝的胜利，就必须坚决镇压反革命。抗美援朝正是为了保护国内工农业生产的安全，而发展工农业生产，也正是保证抗美援朝胜利的一个重要条件。切不可把抗美援朝作为单纯的国际时事来宣传，否则就要大大减弱了必须“抗美援朝”才能“保家卫国”的严重意义。在农村中，这一点更为重要，脱离农村实际的宣传者，往往被农民认为是“讲洋话”的人，这样的宣传，就不会有什么意义了。在宣传的时机上，也应利用各种机会相互结合。例如，各地学校即将放春假，这是一个利用教职员、学生的假期，进行抗美援朝宣传教育的良好机会，应有计划地加以利用。
    当然，订抗美援朝宣传教育计划的内容，并不止于这些方面，还应当根据各地不同情况，有更适当的内容。但是，无论在什么地区，领导机关都应当对抗美援朝运动注意检查。没有订计划的，应检查运动的现况，估计成绩和缺点，迅速订出切实可行的计划。已订计划的，也应随时检查运动进行的状况，及时修正计划的偏差，使计划更加正确，更加有效。不订计划，放任自流，是不对的；有了计划，即以为万事大吉，不加检查，也是不对的。
    现在，离五一大示威游行已经不足一个月了，各地应当异常有计划地来进行抗美援朝的工作，争取在五一以前，至迟在四月下旬，使每一处每一人都能受到抗美援朝的爱国主义的教育，为空前的全国规模的大示威，准备思想的和组织的基础。
