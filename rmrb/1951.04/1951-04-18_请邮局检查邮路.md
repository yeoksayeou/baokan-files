    Please Have the Post Office Check the Postal Routes
    A letter from the Fangcheng Post Office in Guangdong states: "According to readers, the People's Daily arrives very late. Therefore, we hope that the higher authorities will change the transportation route to pass through Guilin and then to Nanning, because Nanning has buses to Qinzhou County. In this way, the newspaper will arrive three or four days faster than coming from Guangzhou."
    A letter from the Xiadao Post Office in Fujian suggests: "If the newspapers sent to them from Beijing were transferred through Nanping, it would be much faster. Now they are transferred through Fucheng, which delays the return trip by three days."
    Editor's Note: Please research the above two suggestions, General Post Office. If the suggestion is reasonable, please find a way to adjust these postal routes immediately. Please also have the General Post Office check if there are similar situations in the postal routes of the Southwest and other regions. Dear Editors:
    We are located in Songtao County, Guizhou Province, and I have two suggestions regarding the distribution of the People's Daily:
    1. The People's Daily not only arrives here very slowly, but there are also frequent occurrences of accumulation and reversed issue numbers. The time difference between reversed issues is often as long as half a month. For example, after reading the newspapers from the beginning of February, it takes more than ten days to receive the newspapers from the end of January. In this way, many events in the newspaper are disconnected and incoherent, making it impossible to gain a systematic understanding of many issues, which causes great losses in our studies and also increases many difficulties. According to our understanding, the main reason for this phenomenon is that the distribution of the People's Daily does not have a fixed postal route. For example, from Beijing to Songtao, sometimes it is by train, sometimes by ship, sometimes it is transferred from Guiyang, sometimes from Huangxian, and sometimes from Chongqing or Xiushan. The situation is very chaotic. I am reporting these situations to you, please find a way to improve them immediately.
    2. The envelopes of the People's Daily we receive are often worn out. Sometimes even the newspapers are broken. Especially during the rainy season, they often get completely rotten, and we cannot read the newspapers we receive. The materials in the readable parts are incomplete, which we find very inconvenient. The main reasons for this are: 1. The paper quality of the newspaper wrappers is too poor to withstand the long-distance transportation and friction; 2. The people who send the newspapers only care about the convenience of wrapping and fold the newspapers into long strips, so they are easily broken. I suggest that oil paper should be used for wrapping in areas far away, and the newspapers should be folded shorter and rolled tighter.

    Editor's Note: Adjusting the postal routes in the Southwest is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. We hope that the relevant parties will handle it quickly. Regarding the method of packaging newspapers, please research and improve it, Distribution Section, Beijing Post Office. Dear Editors:
    Last November, our bureau ordered two copies of the People's Weekly (one for sixteen issues and one for fifteen issues) and twenty issues of Strive for Lasting Peace and People's Democracy from the Distribution Section of the Beijing Post Office with the third book and newspaper addition and subtraction form. However, nearly five months have passed and the Beijing Post Office has not sent us a single copy. Our bureau has sent an official letter to inquire, but they have neither replied nor returned our subscription money. We do not know why. This not only affects our bureau's credibility with readers, but also affects the promotion of the People's Weekly in our county. We hope they will respond publicly so that readers can understand the truth.

    Editor's Note: Please check and respond publicly, Beijing Post Office.

### 请邮局检查邮路

专栏：对本报发行工作的意见

    请邮局检查邮路
    广东防城邮局来信说：“据读者反映：人民日报到达的时间很迟。因此，我们希望上级将运输路线改由桂林经南宁转来。因为南宁有车通至钦县。这样，报纸比从广州来要快三、四天。”
    福建夏道邮局来信建议：北京发给他们的报纸，如改由南平转去要快得多。现在是由福城转去的，往返要多耽误三天时间。
    编者按：以上两项建议，请邮政总局研究。如该项建议是合理的，请即设法调整这些邮路。西南及其他各地邮路是否也有类似情形，亦请邮政总局检查一下。编辑同志：
    我们这里是贵州松桃县，我对人民日报的发行工作有两点意见：
    一、人民日报到这里不但很慢，而且经常有积压和期数颠倒的情形。期数颠倒的时间常相差半月之久。比如读过二月初旬的报后十几天，才接着元月下旬的报纸。这样报上很多事情，前后脱节，连贯不上，使好些问题都不能得到系统的了解，这使我们在学习上受到很大的损失，同时也增加了不少的困难。据我们了解，发生这种现象的主要原因，是人民日报的发行没有固定的邮运路线。如从北京到松桃，有时用火车，有时用轮船，有时由贵阳转来，有时由晃县转来，有时又由重庆、秀山转来，情形非常混乱。我将这些情形反映给你们，请即设法改善。
    二、我们所接到的人民日报，封套往往是被磨烂了。有时连报纸都折断了。特别是雨季，经常会整个的烂掉，我们接到这样的报也无法看，能看的部分材料不完整，我们感到很不方便。这原因主要的是：一、报卷封皮纸质太坏，不能抵耐长途转运的周折和摩擦；二、发报的人只图包封方便，把报纸顺摺成一长条，所以容易折断。我建议路途较远地区应用油纸包封，并将报纸折短点，卷紧些。
      贵州省松桃县人民政府税务局罗贤才
    编者按：调整西南邮运路线，是一个迫切需要解决的问题，希有关方面迅速处理。关于报纸的包装办法，请北京邮局发行科研究改善。编辑同志：
    我局去年十一月以第三号书报增减单向北京邮局发行科订人民周报两份（一份十六期，一份十五期），争取持久和平争取人民民主二十期。但迄今将近五个月，北京邮局一份也未发给我们。我局曾去公函询问，既不答复，也不将订款退给我们，不知是何道理。这样不但影响了我局对读者的信誉；同时也影响了人民周报在我县的推销。希望他们公开答复，使读者了解真象。
        平原省观城邮局邵海成
    编者按：请北京邮局检查，并公开答复。
