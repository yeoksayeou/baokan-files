    People's Court Publicly Executes a Group of Secret Agents
    210,000 people listened to the broadcast outside the venue. After the meeting, over 500 small discussion groups were organized among residents to promote the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in depth.
    [By Our Correspondent] According to Xinhua News Agency: On the 21st, Xi'an held a mass meeting of over 17,000 people to denounce counter-revolutionary crimes, and publicly executed a group of the most heinous counter-revolutionaries on the spot. Over 210,000 citizens from all walks of life listened to the live broadcast of the meeting outside the venue in an organized manner. At the meeting, at the request of representatives of people from all walks of life, the Municipal People's Government escorted the accused counter-revolutionary criminals to the venue. Among the executed counter-revolutionaries were Xu Jingji, a major accomplice of the bandit Hu Zongnan, a major secret agent who manufactured the Jiaokou tragedy in Lintong and murdered countless people (formerly served as the commander of Chiang Kai-shek's New Fifth Army, etc.); Li Hanying, a Kuomintang Central Bureau of Investigation secret agent who arrested more than 130 progressives and murdered countless people in the Guanzhong area in November 1943; Wang Zijian, a Kuomintang Military Intelligence Bureau secret agent who arrested more than 300 people and buried alive and shot 16 patriotic people in Nanjing on the eve of liberation; Lei Jingyi, director of the Kuomintang Central Bureau of Investigation secret service organization "Longhai Railway Statistics Office," who lured hundreds of young students into secret service organizations and murdered and arrested many patriotic youth; Lu Pin, a Military Intelligence Bureau secret agent who, after being captured, educated, and released by the People's Liberation Army, remained unrepentant and served as the leader of the bandit National Defense Ministry's hidden group, and shot eight revolutionary patriots; Li Zhengfan, director of the bandit "Suppression of Rebellion Committee" in Anlu County, Hubei, who destroyed the New Fourth Army newspaper office, brutally killed 39 newspaper staff and progressives, and dug out and stir-fried the hearts and livers of those killed. People from all walks of life hated these heinous counter-revolutionary elements to the bone.
    When the victims or their relatives denounced the crimes of the counter-revolutionary elements at the meeting, the enthusiastic slogans and mournful cries of the representatives at the meeting merged into one. Martyr Ding Xiaofeng was murdered by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in 1949. His wife, Tang Guiying, denounced at the meeting: "Now my three-year-old orphan often asks where his father has gone? My eighty-year-old mother is still looking forward to her son's return day and night. I have the old to support and the young to raise. Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents have made my life so miserable!" When the accusers named the counter-revolutionary criminals escorted to the scene to demand blood debts, more than 10,000 people shouted in unison: "Shoot him!" During the meeting, 155 written opinions and many letters reporting secret agents were received from representatives of all walks of life and masses listening to the broadcast outside the venue. People from all walks of life called the conference through the Municipal People's Broadcasting Station, unanimously requesting the People's Government to execute this group of counter-revolutionary elements immediately. All the ethnic minority committee members and representatives attending the meeting of the Ethnic Affairs Committee of the Northwest Military and Political Committee also put forward their opinions to the conference, representing the people of their ethnic groups in firmly supporting the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries, and expressed their willingness to assist the People's Government in thoroughly eliminating counter-revolutionaries in their ethnic minority areas. Ren Fuzhong, President of the Municipal People's Court, accepted the opinions of hundreds of thousands of people inside and outside the venue, and based on the various articles and clauses of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries," announced the crimes of this group of leading counter-revolutionary elements one by one, and sentenced them to death on the spot. Amidst the storm of applause from the representatives, they shouted slogans such as "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Support the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries!" The people's police immediately escorted these leading counter-revolutionary elements onto prison vehicles and, according to the opinions of the representatives present, paraded them through the four main streets of the east, west, south, and north under the supervision of twelve supervising representatives, and then escorted them to the execution ground for execution by firing squad.
    After the execution of this group of leading counter-revolutionary elements, the representatives who attended the meeting assisted the disorganized residents of various neighborhoods in the city to organize 540 small discussion groups on the 22nd to explain the content of the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries and the policy of combining suppression with leniency, and discussed the significance of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in depth. Many citizens who had been persecuted by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents made accusations at the meeting and poured out their grievances.
    Due to the vigorous and systematic publicity and education work, the people of Xi'an are now familiar with the government's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

　　西安万余人举行控诉反革命罪行大会
    人民法院当场处决一批特务
    会外收听广播群众达二十一万，会后组织居民举行了五百余个小型座谈会，深入宣传镇压反革命。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：西安市于二十一日举行一万七千多人的控诉反革命罪行大会，当场处决了一批反革命首恶。会场外有组织地收听大会实况广播的各界市民达二十一万多人。会上，市人民政府应各界人民代表的要求，曾将被控诉的反革命罪犯押至会场。在被处决的反革命分子中，有胡匪宗南的主要帮凶、制造临潼交口惨案、杀害过无数人民的大特务徐经济（曾任蒋匪新五军军长等职）；有一九四三年十一月在关中地区逮捕一百三十多进步人士和杀害过无数人民的国民党中统特务李含英；有在南京临解放时逮捕三百多人民和活埋、枪杀了十六位爱国人士的国民党军统特务王子健；有诱骗百余青年学生陷入特务组织并杀害、逮捕过许多爱国青年的国民党中统特务组织“陇海路调统室”主任雷景义；有在被人民解放军俘获、教育、释放后仍怙恶不悛、充当匪国防部潜伏组长、枪杀八名革命志士的军统特务吕品；有在湖北安陆县捣毁新四军报馆、残杀报馆工作人员及进步人士三十九人并将被杀者的心肝挖出炒吃的匪“戡乱会”主任李正藩等。各界人民对这些罪大恶极的反革命分子恨之入骨。
    当曾受迫害者或其亲属在会上控诉反革命分子的罪行时，全场代表的激愤口号声和他们的悲愤哭诉联成一片。烈士丁晓峰是在一九四九年被蒋匪特务杀害的。他的妻子汤桂英在会上控诉道：“现在三岁的孤儿还常常问他的爸爸那里去了？八十多岁的老母还在日夜盼望着他的儿子归来。我上有老、下有小，蒋匪特务害得我好苦啊！”控诉者指名向押解到场的反革命罪犯讨索血债时，一万多人齐声高呼：“枪毙他啊！”大会在进行中，曾先后收到各界代表和会外收听广播群众要求惩办特务罪犯的意见书一百五十五件和检举特务书多件。各阶层人民经由市人民广播电台向大会打电话，一致要求人民政府将这批反革命分子立即枪决。参加大会的西北军政委员会民族事务委员会各民族委员及列席代表，也都分别向大会提出意见，代表本民族人民坚决拥护惩治反革命条例，并表示要在本民族地区协助人民政府彻底肃清反革命。市人民法院院长任扶中接受会场内外数十万人民的意见，即依据《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》各条各款，逐一宣布了这批反革命首恶分子的罪状，并当场判处他们死刑。全场代表在暴风雨般的掌声中，高呼“中华人民共和国万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“拥护惩治反革命条例！”等口号。人民法警当即将这些反革命首恶押上刑车，依照到会代表意见，在十二位监刑代表监督下先分东、西、南、北四条大街游行示众，然后解赴刑场执行枪决。
    枪决这批反革命首恶后，参加大会的代表于二十二日在全市范围内分别协助各街坊无组织的居民群众组织了五百四十个小型座谈会，讲解惩治反革命条例的内容和镇压与宽大相结合的政策，深入地讨论了镇压反革命的意义。很多曾受蒋匪特务迫害的市民，都在会上作了控诉，吐出苦水。
    由于大张旗鼓和有系统地进行了宣传教育工作，西安人民对政府镇压反革命的政策已经家喻户晓。
