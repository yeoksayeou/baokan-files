    Tianjin Foreign Transportation Company Should Pay Attention to Cherishing National Property

To the Editor:

    Recently, Tianjin Foreign Transportation Company used a large number of open-top railcars to transport certain goods from Tianjin Station to the Northeast. The tarpaulins covering the open-top cars were supported by bamboo poles. Due to the shaking of the train, the bamboo poles punctured the tarpaulins. Some tarpaulins had as many as seventeen large holes. In over two hundred cars that have already passed, more than 90% of the tarpaulins were punctured. These tarpaulins cannot be used again next time. According to the Railway Bureau, the price of each tarpaulin is 3.5 million yuan. Damaging two hundred tarpaulins is a considerable loss. I suggest that Tianjin Foreign Transportation Company find a way to improve this method of damaging state property.

专栏：来信摘要

    天津国外运输公司应注意爱惜国家财产编辑同志：
    天津国外运输公司最近用大批敞车，装载某项物品，由天津站运往东北。敞车所盖的篷布，是用竹杆支架着的。因行车震荡，竹杆把篷布都扎坏了，一块篷布最多的扎有十七个大窟窿，在已过去的二百多车上，有百分之九十以上的篷布都被扎坏，这些篷布下次就不能利用了。按路局篷布价格每块为三百五十万元。弄坏二百块篷布，是一个相当大的损失。我建议天津国外运输公司对此种损害国家财产的办法应设法改进。
