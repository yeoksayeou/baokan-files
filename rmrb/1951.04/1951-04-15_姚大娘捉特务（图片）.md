    Granny Yao Catches a Spy
    By Miao Di and Zhao Zhifang
    (Seven) Granny Yao's family was on guard against Yang Fazhang day and night. In early March, Granny Yao heard that he had the intention of absconding, and she couldn't sleep soundly. At two o'clock in the morning on the ninth, Granny Yao saw that the lights were still on in Yang's house. She woke up the old man and asked him to take a walk in the yard. The old man Yao went out, and soon the lights in the opposite house went out.
    (Eight) At about six o'clock in the morning, the old man of the Yang family went to Shi Jintong to ask for the key to the gate. Because the time had not arrived, Shi Jintong did not give it to him. The old man of the Yang family went back again.
    (Nine) Granny Yao couldn't put her mind at ease. At night, she and her daughter-in-law took turns watching the movements in Yang Fazhang's room. When dawn broke and the gate was just opened, Yao's daughter-in-law saw at a glance a person in the yard carrying a large bedding roll out. She shouted, "Mother, look, the spy is running away!" Granny Yao immediately sat up when she heard this.

    姚大娘捉特务
    苗地  赵志方 作
    （七）姚大娘一家人，日夜提防着杨法章。三月初，姚大娘听说他有潜逃的意图，连睡觉都不踏实了。九号夜里两点多钟，姚大娘看见杨家屋里还有灯亮，她便叫醒老头，让他到院里去转一圈。姚老头出去不久，对屋里灯就灭了。
    （八）大约在早晨六点钟的时候，杨家老头子去找史金桐要大门钥匙。因为时间没到，史金桐没给他。杨家老头子又走了回去。
    （九）姚大娘放不下心。晚上，她和儿媳轮流注意着杨法章屋里的动静。天亮了，大门刚开，姚家媳妇一眼看见院里有一个人，扛着大铺盖卷往外走。她便喊：“娘，你看特务要跑！”姚大娘一听，马上坐了起来。
