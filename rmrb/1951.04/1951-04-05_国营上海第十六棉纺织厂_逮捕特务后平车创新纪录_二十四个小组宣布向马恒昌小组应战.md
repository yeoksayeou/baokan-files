　　State-owned Shanghai No. 16 Cotton Mill
    Flatbed Innovation Record After Arresting Special Agent
    Twenty-Four Groups Announce Challenge to Ma Hengchang Group
    Since the flatbed group of the Weaving Security Department of the state-owned Shanghai No. 16 Cotton Mill arrested the special agent Chen Xin at the end of February, the workers' production enthusiasm has been high, creating a new record of only 48 hours for a large flatbed (Toyota automatic loom), saving two hours compared to the 50-hour standard stipulated by the Textile Administration Bureau. Now, with this achievement, they are challenging the Ma Hengchang Group and all flatbed Toyota automatic loom workers in Shanghai's textile mills.
    In February, it took them at least 100 hours to flatbed a unit, sometimes even 160 hours, and the work done was not very good. The main reason for this was that the special agent Chen Xin was causing trouble. Chen Xin was a Kuomintang secret agent, and also a "big brother" of the "Bo Dao Party" and "Hong Men," a director and supervisor of the puppet trade union. Before liberation, he committed all kinds of evil deeds. After liberation, he refused to register and specialized in sabotaging production, deliberately breaking the 36 teeth on the loom and provoking workers to quarrel. Anyone who worked actively would be scolded by him. The workers all hated him. The production of the flatbed group was never good.
    After the government arrested the special agent Chen Xin, the workers felt like a weight had been lifted from their hearts. They all said, "This kind of person should have been arrested long ago. Only after he's arrested can we improve production!" The workers held an accusation meeting, accusing Chen Xin of his crimes. The workers who had disagreements before, after laying their cards on the table, realized that Chen Xin was behind it all. Everyone was united, and the conversation turned to production. After repeated discussions, a patriotic pact was formulated, and new work methods were also incorporated into it. This is why they were able to create a new flatbed record.
    Now, 24 groups in the factory have formally announced their challenge to the Ma Hengchang Group.

　　国营上海第十六棉纺织厂
    逮捕特务后平车创新纪录        
    二十四个小组宣布向马恒昌小组应战
    国营上海第十六棉纺织厂织保部平车组，自从二月底逮捕了特务分子陈新以后，工友生产热情高涨，创造了大平车（丰田式自动织机）一部只化四十八小时的新纪录，比纺织管理局规定的标准五十小时还省二小时。现在他们以这个成绩，向马恒昌小组应战，向全上海各纺织厂平丰田式自动织机的工友们挑战。
    在二月份，他们大平车一部，起码要化一百小时，有时甚至到一百六十小时，做出来的活还不怎么好。这主要原因是特务陈新在里面捣蛋。陈新是中统特务，同时是“薄刀党”、“红门”的“大哥”，伪工会的理监事，解放前无恶不作，解放后拒不登记，专门破坏生产，故意把织布机上的三十六牙齿打碎，并挑拨工友吵架，谁积极工作，就挨他的骂，工友们个个恨他。平车组生产始终搞不好。
    政府把特务陈新逮捕以后，工友们心上像去了一块石头，都说：“这种人老早就该捉，捉了去我们生产才搞得好！”工友们开了控诉会，控诉了陈新的罪行。以前闹意见的工友，把话一摊开，原来全是陈新在捣鬼，大家心也齐了，话头便转到生产。经过反复讨论，订出了爱国公约，把新的工作法也订了进去。所以能创造了平车的新纪录。
    现在该厂已经有二十四个小组，正式宣布向马恒昌小组应战。
