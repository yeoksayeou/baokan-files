    Refusing to Grow Old
    By Guan Jian
    (I) After the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, the Korean people living in the Victory Village north of the Yalu River in Northeast China returned to Korea one after another to join the Korean People's Army. The heart of the emancipated peasant, Old Man Li, was also uneasy. He thought, "The American imperialists are truly ruthless wolves!"
    (II) Old Man Li returned home and said to his daughter-in-law and children, "With imperialism around, we can never have a stable and good life!" Old Man Li's daughter-in-law is the director of the Victory Village Women's Federation. After listening to her father-in-law's words, she said to him, "After the American imperialists invade Korea, they will also invade China. It's just like the Japanese devils back then!"
    (III) His grandson was looking at picture books beside Old Man Li; Old Man Li was sitting on the kang, recalling the oppression he had suffered from the Japanese devils in the past.

    不服老
    关键作
    （一）美帝国主义发动了侵略朝鲜的战争以后，住在鸭绿江北岸的东北胜利村的朝鲜族人民，纷纷回到朝鲜参加朝鲜人民军。翻身农民李老头的心里也不平静了。他想：“美帝国主义真是一只狠心狼！”
    （二）李老头回到家中，对儿媳和孩子们说：“有帝国主义在，咱们的好日子总不能过稳！”李老头的儿媳妇，是胜利村妇女联合会主任。她听了公公的话后，就对他说：“美帝国主义侵略朝鲜以后，还要侵略中国。这就像当年小日本一样！”
    （三）孙儿在李老头的旁边看着画报；李老头却坐在炕上，回忆起过去受日本鬼子欺压的事情来。
