　  400,000 Women in Northern Jiangsu
　  Demonstrate Against American Arming of Japan
    The broad masses of women in Northern Jiangsu are actively participating in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea. Counties and cities have universally convened representative conferences of women from all walks of life to Resist America and Aid Korea.

    According to statistics from 150 towns and cities and over 600 townships, approximately 400,000 women participated in demonstrations against American arming of Japan. Housewives, shop owners, nuns, and Catholic sisters, who had never participated in social activities before, also joined the marches and other patriotic activities. In Yangzhou City, housewives accounted for over 80 percent of the 18,000 women who marched. Wang Xiuduan, a housewife in Nantong City with eleven children, had never gone out before. In this movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, she actively participated in the work of the Democratic Women's Federation, making flags, posting slogans, and participating in marches every day. Women throughout the region donated over 21 million yuan, sewed 57,000 comfort bags, and wrote a large number of letters of慰问 to the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean People's Army, and to provide relief to Korean refugees. Women in Yangzhou, Dongtai, Liuhe and other counties and cities, as well as in some villages, have all signed patriotic pledges. Working women are actively engaged in patriotic production competitions. The female workers of Nantong Dasheng Textile Factory are preparing to challenge the Ma Hengchang group. Sixty-nine female agricultural labor models in Rudong County have drawn up a full-year harvest plan.
