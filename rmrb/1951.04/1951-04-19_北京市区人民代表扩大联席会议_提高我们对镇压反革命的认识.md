　  Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Expanded Joint Conference
  　Enhancing Our Understanding of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries

To the Editor:
    After twenty-five student representatives from Tsinghua University participated in the Beijing Municipal and District People's Representatives Expanded Joint Conference on March 24th to discuss the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionary criminals, they universally enhanced their understanding of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the people's democratic dictatorship.
    Student representative Wang Qiming (a Christian) was very afraid before attending the meeting. When she arrived at the venue and saw that the order was good and the leaders were present, she immediately felt more at ease. After listening to Mayor Peng Zhen's speech, she felt it made a lot of sense. During the report by Luo Ruiqing, Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, the masses shouted slogans, and she was so excited that she followed everyone in shouting slogans; but she was still unwilling to shout the words "shoot to death." After listening to the accusations of the persecuted, she cried. In the past, she believed that no guilty person should be killed; they should be reformed. At this time, she realized that these ringleaders must be executed, otherwise, the people would suffer greater harm. She deeply felt the flesh-and-blood relationship between the people's government and the people; she loved her government even more.
    Another representative said: After this meeting, he more clearly understood the significance of the people's democratic dictatorship. Before the meeting, he thought: I've seen enough democracy, today I'll see dictatorship. At the meeting, he listened to the leaders' reports and the masses' accusations, and he specifically understood the principle of "democracy for whom, dictatorship for whom" and that democracy must be closely combined with dictatorship. He said: "The government not only repeatedly and earnestly discussed the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, but also told the people the specific situation and let the people decide. Such a government is truly the people's own."
    Youth League member Ji Jiqing criticized her past objective attitude towards the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. In the past, she also agreed with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, but thought that "the government suppresses counter-revolutionaries, and we only need to support it," separating herself from the government. This time, she heard the blood and tearful accusations of the persecuted and specifically understood the crimes of counter-revolutionaries in killing the people and sabotaging production…; especially seeing the attitude of the worker-peasant representatives and the persecuted in resolutely demanding the execution of counter-revolutionary criminals, she realized that she must support the government's suppression of counter-revolutionaries with practical actions.
    Through the representatives' relaying and propaganda, all the students in the school have enhanced their understanding of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. This tells us that the people are resolutely supporting the large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries!

　  北京市区人民代表扩大联席会议
  　提高我们对镇压反革命的认识编辑同志：
    清华大学学生代表二十五人参加了三月二十四日北京市市、区人民代表扩大联席会议讨论镇压反革命罪犯问题以后，普遍提高了对镇压反革命和人民民主专政的认识。
    学生代表王其明（基督教徒）在参加会议前，心里很害怕。到了会场，她看到秩序很好，首长都在，立刻放心一些了。听了彭真市长的讲话，她觉得很有道理。在北京市公安局长罗瑞卿兼局长报告时，群众高呼口号，她激动得跟着大家呼口号；但还不愿喊出“枪毙”两字，听了受迫害者控诉，她哭了。她过去认为对任何有罪的人都不应杀，应该感化。这时，她认识了必须处决这些首恶分子，否则就会使人民受到更大的损害。她深深感到人民政府和人民的血肉关系；她更爱自己的政府了。
    另一位代表说：经过这次会议，他更清楚地认识了人民民主专政的意义。在开会前，他想：民主看得多了，今天看看专政。在会上他听了首长报告、群众控诉，他具体认识了“对谁民主、对谁专政”及民主必须与专政密切结合的道理。他说：“政府对镇压反革命问题不但翻复认真讨论，并且将具体情况告诉人民，让人民来裁决。这样的政府真正是人民自己的。”
    青年团员季基卿批判了她过去对镇压反革命问题的客观态度。过去她也赞成镇压反革命，但认为“政府镇压反革命，我们只要拥护就够了”，把自己和政府分开了。这次她听到受迫害者的血泪控诉，具体地了解了反革命分子杀害人民、破坏生产……的罪行；尤其看到工农代表和被迫害者坚决要求枪决反革命罪犯的态度，她认识到自己必须以实际行动来拥护政府镇压反革命。
    经过代表们的传达、宣传，全校同学都提高了对镇压反革命的认识。这告诉我们：人民是坚决拥护大张旗鼓镇压反革命的！          青兴
