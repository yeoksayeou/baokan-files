Regarding "The Test": A Self-Criticism
Zhang Zhimin

　　After reading Comrade Li Keya's criticism of my novella "The Test" in the 94th issue of *People's Literature*, I initially felt uncomfortable. I felt that he didn't understand when this novel was depicting, didn't consider when it was written, and used the "Regulations on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries" promulgated in February 1951 to measure a work from 1949, which would naturally lead to some inappropriate judgments. I also thought that the treatment of the protagonist of the novel—Liu Qingchuan—was related to the deviations in the "leniency policy" implemented by some leading cadres at the time.

　　After calming down, I reread the criticism several times, connected it to theoretical policies, and compared it with my own work for examination. Only then did I begin to realize that the criticism was correct. It wasn't that it wasn't wrong because it was measured by past policy standards. Our Party and government's policies have never stated that we can condone or pity criminals who betray the people. Especially after studying the policy document of "resolutely suppressing counterrevolutionaries" today, I feel the seriousness of this mistake even more, and thus the education I received is even more profound. In addition to revising this novel, I will make the following self-criticism here:

　　1. How did I come to write this novel?

　　The first draft of this novel was written in 1948. The subject matter was a true story told to me by a comrade from a certain Party school at the time. It left a deep impression on me. I told this story to many comrades, and they also felt it was very educational. Later, I wrote it into a novel draft. From the occurrence to the end of the event, there were almost no major changes, only the names of the characters were changed, and some minor insertions were added. After this draft was written, it was put away and forgotten.

　　After entering the city, I personally witnessed some comrades failing the test of urban life and becoming corrupt and degenerate. I felt that although some people couldn't withstand the test in the past combat environment, in the victorious and peaceful environment, the sugar-coated poison was also severely corroding some of us. I also thought that although we were victorious and at peace, there were still hidden enemies around us. Based on this idea, I thought of organizing this work, wanting to use it as a reference for these comrades.

　　During the revision, I also considered the treatment of this character. Should he exist and be reborn? Or should he be destroyed? In the end, I thought that even though he had done things that harmed the people and the Party, even though he had made serious mistakes, as long as there was still a glimmer of hope for reform, the Party and the people would save him. In order to make the reasons for my handling more convincing, I also thought at the time: Our government adopts the policy of "the ringleaders must be punished, the coerced are not to be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded" towards counterrevolutionaries. Although Liu Qingchuan's mistake was that after being captured by the enemy, he succumbed under the enemy's threat and torture, and was forced to lead the enemy to capture our cadres, and he also succumbed in a despicable and selfish way to the special agent's honey trap, accepted the task of stealing guns, and caused losses to the Party and the people, he was not a die-hard special agent, but a person who had lost his way. For such a person, giving him a certain punishment was still possible to reform him. Therefore, in the novel, he was given a punishment and sent to study.

　　After this novel was included in the collection and published, I heard some comrades' opinions, but they all said: "This story is still very touching." Therefore, I became even more self-righteous and felt there was no problem!

　　2. How were the errors produced?

　　The first thing to examine is my serious peaceful paralysis thought and unclear class stance. Although my intention was to educate some comrades who had peaceful paralysis thought and an unstable class stance, I myself was shrouded in this kind of thought. Therefore, my vision was blurred. I did not sufficiently estimate Liu Qingchuan's mistakes, and I did not realize the seriousness of his betrayal of the motherland, the betrayal of the people, and the betrayal of the Party; I did not stand on the side of the people's interests to hate his crimes and despise his shameful behavior. My eyes did not first see the losses his crimes gave to the people, but first saw "hope that he can still be reformed." Therefore, I adopted a lenient and accommodating approach to this traitor. I didn't think about it, such treatment is wrong, let alone think that tolerance towards counterrevolutionaries is cruelty towards the people!

　　Comrade Li Keya's criticism said: "I sincerely hope that our writers will seriously study theoretical policies." Upon my own examination, I feel very ashamed! Of course, it's not that I haven't studied, but I really haven't studied systematically and deeply. Most of what I have learned is conceptual, and even sometimes when I feel unfamiliar with the policies in my own creation process, I just flip through the documents. That only understands some superficial things, and doesn't comprehend its spirit and essence. Because of this, sometimes my creations produce harmful works that violate the Party's policies.

　　Regarding the essence of writing struggles, writing new characters, and positive factors, although in my ideological understanding, it is not a very new issue anymore. However, it has not been long since I consciously paid attention to doing it. For a long time in the past, due to the instability of my class viewpoint and deviations in my creative thinking, I could not correctly observe life. Therefore, I did not actively create new character images to educate the people, nor could I accurately analyze and recognize the essence of struggle. Instead, I often saw problems as isolated and one-sided; I could not grasp the actively advancing things, and I could not get rid of the passively backward things. So I preferred to write about backward transformation and write about negative characters. I even felt interested in accidental and bizarre stories. When writing about backward characters, the images were prominent, while when writing about new characters, I started from concepts. In this way, I distorted the reality of life and lost the positive significance of the work.

　　The production of these errors, in addition to my low theoretical policy and artistic level, is mainly due to my insufficient study. Although I have been paying attention to correcting some problems, the progress is still far from enough. I am sincerely grateful for Comrade Li Keya's criticism, which is a spur to me. I need to better study theoretical policies, strengthen ideological cultivation, study realistic creative ideas and methods, and go deeper into analyzing life to gradually improve in my creation!

### 对于“考验”的检讨

　　对于“考验”的检讨
　　张志民
    看到《人民文艺》九十四期上，李克亚同志对我的中篇小说“考验”的批评，开始，我有些不痛快。我觉得，他不了解这篇小说是描写什么时候的事情，不看看是写在什么时间，而以一九五一年二月颁布的“惩治反革命条例”来衡量这篇一九四九年的作品，当然会有些地方不妥的，并且想到：对于小说的主人公——刘青川的处理，与当时某些领导干部执行“宽大政策”的偏差是有关系的。
    在我冷静下来后，我将这个批评重读了几遍，又连系着理论政策，对照我那篇东西进行了检查，才开始认识到这个批评是对的，并不是以过去的政策标准来衡量它就没有错，我们党和政府的政策，什么时候也没说过，对于叛卖人民的罪犯可以迁就、怜悯。而特别是在今天学习过“坚决镇压反革命”的政策文件后，就尤其感到这错误的严重，因而对我的教育也愈加深刻。我除去要对这篇小说进行修改外，并在这里作以下检讨：
    一、怎么写起了这篇小说？
    这篇小说的初稿，是写在一九四八年，这个题材是当时某党校的一位同志，向我谈的一件真实的故事，那时给予我的印象很深，我把这个故事讲给过许多同志听，他们也觉得对自己有很大教育。以后我把它写成了小说的草稿，从事件的发生到结束，几乎均无大变动，只是换了一下人物的姓名，增添了一些小的穿插。这篇草稿写成后就一直放起来了！
    入城以后，自己亲闻亲见个别同志经不起城市生活考验而腐化堕落的事件，便感到：在过去战斗的环境里，虽然有的人是经不起考验的，然而在胜利后和平的环境里，包着糖衣的毒素对我们某些人的腐蚀也是严重的，并且想到：虽然是胜利了，和平了，但是我们的身边仍存在着隐蔽的敌人。基于这个念头，便想起了整理这篇作品，想借此作为这些同志的一个借鉴。
    在整理中，我也考虑过对这个人物的处理，是叫他存在、新生呢？还是把它毁灭呢？最后想到：尽管他对人民对党作下了有危害的事情，尽管他犯过严重的错误，但只要他还有一线改造的希望，党和人民是会挽救他的。为使得我这样处理的理由更充分些，当时还想：我们政府对反革命是采取着“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”的方针，而刘青川的错误虽然是被敌人俘虏后，在敌人威胁拷打下他屈膝了，被迫地领敌人捕捉了我们的干部，又卑鄙自私地中了特务的美人计，接受了偷枪的任务，给党和人民造下了损失，但他总还不是个死心塌地的特务，而是个失足分子，对这样的人，给他一定的处分还是可以改造的。所以在小说中给他以处分，就让他去学习了。
    把这篇小说编入集内出版后，我曾听到一些同志的意见，但他们都是说：“这个故事还很感动人。”因此，自己也就更自以为是没问题了！
    二、错误是怎样产生的？
    首先要检查的，就是自己严重的和平麻痹思想和阶级立场不明确，自己的意图虽想以此来教育一些存在着和平麻痹思想和阶级立场不稳的同志，然而自己本身就被这种思想所笼罩着。因此，才模糊了自己的视线，对于刘青川的错误，没有足够的估计，没有认识到他叛卖祖国、叛卖人民、叛卖党的严重性；没有把脚根站在人民的利益方面来痛恨他的罪恶，来鄙视他可耻的行为。自己的眼睛不是先看到他的罪恶所给予人民的损失，而是首先看到了“希望他还能改造”，所以才对于这个叛徒采取宽大、迁就的处理。自己没有去设想一下，这样处理是错误的，更没有去想想，对于反革命的宽容就是对人民的残忍！
    李克亚同志的批评中说：“我诚恳地希望我们的作家认真地学习理论政策。”自己检查起来，很觉得惭愧！当然也并不是没学，而是的确没有系统、深刻地去研究学习过。所学的一些，也大部分是概念的，甚至有时候在自己创作过程中感到对政策不熟悉时，就只是去翻一翻文件，那只是了解一些皮毛，而没有领会到它的精神和实质。因为这样，所以在自己的创作中，就有时会产生出违反了党的政策的，有害的作品来。
    关于写斗争的本质，写新人物，积极因素的问题，在自己思想认识上，虽然不算是个很新的问题了。然而，比较有意识地注意去做，却还不久。在过去很长时间中，由于自己阶级观点的不稳固，创作思想上的偏差，所以使得自己不能正确地去观察生活，因此，不是去积极地创造新的人物形象来教育人民，不能准确地分析和认识斗争的本质，而往往是把问题看成孤立的，片面的；对积极前进的东西抓不住，而对消极落后的东西丢不完。所以就偏爱于写落后转变，写反面人物。甚至对于偶然、离奇的故事感觉兴趣。写起落后人物则形象突出，而写到新的人物则从概念出发了。这样，也就歪曲了生活的现实，失掉了作品的积极意义。
    产生这些错误，除去由于自己理论政策和艺术水平低以外，主要还是由于自己学习的不够，虽然有些问题自己已经注意在改正着，但进步还很不够。李克亚同志的批评，我是衷心感激的，这对我是一个鞭策。自己需要更好地去学习理论政策，加强思想修养学习现实主义的创作思想、方法，更深入地去分析生活，来在自己的创作中逐渐提高！
