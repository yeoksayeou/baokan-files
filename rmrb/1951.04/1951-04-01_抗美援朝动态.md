　　Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement Updates
　　　　Good Experiences in Shanxi's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement

　　The Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement in Shanxi Province has unfolded on a large scale. This movement has greatly promoted the raising of people's political consciousness, thereby advancing patriotic production competitions, grain requisition and taxation, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries.

　　The main experiences of Shanxi in carrying out the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement are:

　　(1) Leadership attention is a crucial link. Without the leadership's attention, there would be no attention from cadres, and the movement would not develop. In Shanxi, the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement has developed well in places where the leadership attaches importance to it, and vice versa.

　　(2) Anti-American and Aid-Korea political education must be closely integrated with various practical tasks. For example, banning the reactionary Yiguandao sect is closely linked with the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement. Through current affairs education, the masses have raised their political vigilance and realized that Yiguandao's rumors and sabotage echo and cooperate with American aggression, thus actively assisting the government in eliminating special agents.

　　(3) Combine propaganda work with the self-education of the masses. On the one hand, publicize the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement by linking it to the masses' personal interests; on the other hand, organize the masses to discuss and debate, and denounce the crimes of Japanese invaders, Chinese traitors, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the landlord class, linking these crimes with American imperialism. Or, recall the experience of heroic struggle and eventual victory in the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, which is very helpful in stimulating the masses' anti-American and patriotic enthusiasm and enhancing national self-esteem and self-confidence.

　　(4) Organize all propaganda forces and use various propaganda tools and methods. In addition to the propaganda and education departments, Shanxi Province has organized a large number of cadres to participate in propaganda work, paying attention to using newspapers, radio stations, systematic popular pamphlets, and pictorials for propaganda. Short-term training courses were held to train activists in the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement, so that they could go back and mobilize the masses. Organized cadres from government agencies and teachers and students from schools to conduct propaganda among the masses. Used winter schools and people's schools to publicize current affairs. Organized gatherings and demonstrations for different professions and organizations. Used methods such as reading newspapers and slide shows to conduct propaganda among the masses. These methods have been very effective.

　　At present, the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement is still developing poorly in some villages in Shanxi, and there are still blind spots. The patriotic movement in religious circles is particularly not in-depth. To this end, the leading organs of Shanxi Province have put forward the requirements of consolidation and deepening, expansion and development, and adherence to implementation.

　　　　Northwest National Minorities' Movement Against American Arming of Japan

　　The patriotic movement of the people of all ethnic minorities in the Northwest region against the American arming of Japan is gradually unfolding. As of early March, approximately 130,000 people in major, medium, and small cities and some pastoral areas have participated in marches and demonstrations. Current affairs seminars have been widely held in various places, and patriotic covenants including strengthening unity among ethnic groups, participating in militia, and stepping up production have been formulated. Qinghai Province has established a "Propaganda Committee for Ethnic Minority Areas" to conduct in-depth propaganda work in pastoral areas. The people of Altay, Xinjiang, have established the "Altay Branch of the Chinese Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression" and are preparing to launch a propaganda movement.

　　　　Shadow Puppetry Widely Welcomed in Shuangcheng's Current Affairs Propaganda

　　Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, has achieved great success in using shadow puppetry to carry out Anti-American and Aid-Korea propaganda.

　　Donkey shadow puppetry is one of the folk entertainment forms, especially in rural areas, with a long history, and is loved by the majority of farmers. Shuangcheng County used donkey shadow puppetry for propaganda in the past during the land reform and the great production movement, and it was very effective. Therefore, at the beginning of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement to protect the country, it was decided to make full use of this form. The county has successively held two training courses, and under the leadership of artist Wen Changhuai, more than ten new shadow puppetry scripts have been created with reforms in both content and form. Among them are "The Brutality of American Imperialism," "Another Debt of Blood," and "The End of the Aggressor." The characters in the shadow scrolls are all dressed in modern clothes, and airplanes, artillery, tanks, etc. have been added. During the performance, the bombs roar when they come down, making the battle scene very tense and fierce. This has never happened before.

　　These new shadow puppets, through nine shadow puppet groups, are active in every village in Shuangcheng County, and have performed in Lalin, Acheng and other places. In the past two months, more than 380 performances have been performed, with an audience of more than 340,000 people. Each performance has at least 500 people or more, and sometimes 2,000 or 3,000 people. When performing in Linjiang Village, District 9, Shuangcheng, farmers from Zhaodong County (Heilongjiang Province) on the north bank of the Songhua River also drove rubber-wheeled carts to come. Grandma Zhang, who had never been to a meeting since "August 15th," also put on her new robe to watch the shadow puppets.

　　The widespread performance of shadow puppets has greatly educated the farmers and inspired their enthusiasm for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect their homes and the country, making the masses more hateful of U.S. imperialism. After watching "The Brutality of American Imperialism," Shi Dianying's wife in Shengli Village, District 6, Shuangcheng, said: "The American devils raped and killed our women first, killed the mother, and the child was still breastfeeding on the mother's body. We can't let them occupy Korea and then invade us." When "Another Debt of Blood" was performed in Jinshan and Xing'an villages in District 8, many old ladies were moved to tears. When "Cannot Be Paralyzed" was performed in Renyong Village, Ma Xicai said: "Zhang Weifu (the spy in the play who spreads rumors) is made of donkey skin. If he were a real person, I would have beaten him to death."

　　抗美援朝动态
            山西开展抗美援朝运动的好经验
    山西省抗美援朝运动已大规模展开，这一运动对于提高人民政治觉悟，从而开展爱国生产竞赛、征粮征税、镇压反革命等工作都起了很大的推动作用。
    山西开展抗美援朝运动的主要经验是：
    （一）领导重视是决定一环。没有领导重视，就没有干部重视，就没有运动的开展。在山西，凡是领导上重视的地方，抗美援朝运动就开展得较好，反之就较差。
    （二）抗美援朝的政治教育必须与各种实际工作密切结合。如取缔反动的一贯道与抗美援朝密切结合，群众经过时事教育，提高了政治警惕性，认识到一贯道的造谣破坏与美国侵略互相呼应配合，因而积极协助政府肃清特务。
    （三）宣传工作和群众的自我教育相结合。一方面联系群众的切身利害，向群众宣传抗美援朝；另方面组织群众讨论和争辩，并控诉日寇汉奸、蒋介石匪帮、地主阶级的罪行，把这些罪行与美帝国主义联系起来，或回忆抗日战争及解放战争中英勇奋斗终于获得胜利的经验，对于激发群众反美爱国热情，提高民族自尊心和自信心，很有作用。
    （四）组织一切宣传力量，运用各种宣传工具和方法。除宣教部门外，山西省曾组织广大干部参加宣传工作，注意运用报纸、广播电台、有系统的通俗小册子和画报进行宣传。办了短期训练班，训练抗美援朝运动中的积极分子，使他们回去发动广大群众。组织了机关干部、学校师生对群众进行宣传。利用了冬学、民校宣传时事。组织了不同职业、团体举行集会和游行示威。运用了读报、幻灯等方式对群众进行宣传。这些方法都很有效果。
    目前抗美援朝运动在山西部分乡村还开展得较差，并且还有死角。宗教界的爱国运动尤其不深入。为此，山西省领导机关已提出巩固深入、扩大发展、坚持贯彻的要求。
            西北各少数民族的反对美国武装日本运动
    西北区各少数民族人民反对美国武装日本的爱国运动，正逐渐展开，截至三月上旬为止，各大、中、小城市及部分游牧区已有约十三万人参加了游行示威。各地普遍地召开了时事座谈会，并订出了包括加强各民族间团结，参加民兵，加紧生产等项内容的爱国公约。青海省成立了“民族地区宣传委员会”，将深入游牧区进行宣传工作。新疆阿山人民成立了“中国保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会阿山分会”，准备开展宣传运动。
            双城时事宣传中皮影戏大受欢迎
    松江省双城县运用皮影戏进行抗美援朝宣传，获得很大成绩。
    驴皮影戏是民间游艺形式之一，尤其在农村有悠久的历史，为广大农民所喜爱。双城县过去在土地改革及大生产运动中，就运用驴皮影戏进行宣传，功效很大。因此，在抗美援朝保家卫国运动将开始时，就决定充分利用这一形式。该县曾先后开办了两次训练班，并在艺人温长淮带头下，创作了从内容到形式都有所改革的十多本新的皮影戏。其中计有“美帝国主义暴行”，“又一笔血债”，“侵略者的下场”等。影卷中的人物都穿着时装，另添有飞机，大炮，坦克等。在演出时，炸弹下来还轰轰作响，把战斗场面表现得很紧张很激烈。这是过去没有过的。
    这些新的皮影，通过了九个皮影小组，活动在双城县每个村庄里，并到拉林、阿城等地演出。两个月来已演出过三百八十场之多，观众达三十万四千余人。每场最少五百人以上，多的时候达二、三千人。在双城九区临江村演出时，远在松花江北肇东县（黑龙江省）的农民也坐着胶皮车赶来了。从“八一五”到现在一次会场也没到过的张老太太，也把新大袍穿上来看皮影了。
    皮影的广泛演出，大大地教育了农民，鼓舞了农民抗美援朝保家卫国的情绪，使群众对美帝国主义更加仇恨。双城六区胜利村石殿英老婆，看完“美帝国主义暴行”后，说：“美国鬼子对咱们妇女先奸后杀，杀死妈妈，孩子还在妈妈身上吃奶。咱可不能叫他占住朝鲜，再来侵略我们。”在八区金山、杏山等村演“又一笔血债”时，很多老太太都感动得流了泪。在仁勇村演“麻痹不得”时，马喜财说：“张维福（剧中造谣的特务）是驴皮做的，他要是个真人，我非把他打死不可。”
