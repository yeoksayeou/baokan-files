Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 12th - The India-China Friendship Association, established in Calcutta on February 12, is actively promoting friendship between the peoples of China and India. Chakravarti, Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the India-China Friendship Association and Professor of Chinese History at the University of Calcutta, stated on March 23: Now that China has entered a new stage in its history, the Indian people naturally want to know how the new China is being built. The friendship between our two peoples is natural and necessary, and the main purpose of the Association is to consolidate this friendship. Well-known scientists, writers, artists, educators, professors, journalists, and political leaders of democratic parties in West Bengal Province are enthusiastically supporting this noble endeavor.

The Organizing Committee of the India-China Friendship Association has decided to prepare for a congress with broad representation to create a permanent organizational form for the Association. At the same time, the committee plans to hold various gatherings, symposiums, exhibitions, show films, and publish books and periodicals to deepen the work of the India-China Friendship Association among the masses, thereby strengthening the ties between the Chinese and Indian peoples and promoting friendship between the two countries.

According to the plan, the India-China Friendship Association held its first symposium entitled "Information on China" on the 3rd of this month. The scientist Bose, who chaired the symposium, said: "The 350 million Indian people and the 450 million Chinese people together account for almost half of the world's population. In the past, towering mountains did not separate them. Today, nothing can hinder the friendship between the Indian and Chinese peoples." Speakers at the meeting included Professor Chakravarti, Dr. Vari, a Hungarian scholar of Oriental philosophy and history, Dr. Nag, who visited China with the Indian poet Tagore in 1924, and J.K. Banerjee, editor of the "Republic" weekly.

　　促进中印两国人民友谊
    加尔各答印中友协筹备举行代表大会
    【新华社新德里十二日电】二月十二日在加尔各答成立的印中友好协会，正积极促进中、印两国人民的友谊。印中友好协会组织委员会主席、加尔各答大学中国历史教授查克拉佛蒂三月二十三日发表声明说：现在中国已进入它的历史的新阶段，印度人民自然会希望知道新的中国是怎样建立起来的。我们两国人民之间的友谊是自然而且必要的，协会的主要宗旨就是巩固这种友谊。西孟加拉省有名的科学家、作家、艺术家、教育家、教授、记者以及民主党派的政治领袖都热烈支持这种高尚的努力。
    印中友协组织委员会已决定筹备有广泛代表性的大会，产生协会的永久组织形式。同时该委员会计划举行各种集会、座谈会，举办展览会，放映电影，出版书刊，使印中友协的工作深入群众，借以加强中、印两国人民的联系，促进中、印两国人民的友谊。
    印中友协按照计划于本月三日举行了名为“中国的信息”的第一次座谈会。主持座谈会的科学家博斯说：“三亿五千万印度人民和四亿五千万中国人民加起来几乎占全世界人口的一半。在过去，崇山峻岭并没有能够把他们隔开。今天也是一样，没有东西能够阻碍印度人民和中国人民之间的友谊。”在会上发言的还有查克拉佛蒂教授、匈牙利东方哲学和历史学家瓦里博士、曾在一九二四年和印度诗人泰戈尔一道到过中国的纳格博士以及《共和国》周刊主编杰·凯·班那吉等。
