　　Why Do the Chinese People and All Asian People Oppose the United States Rearming Japan?
　　Wang Yunsheng
    Japanese fascists invaded China and massacred the people of Asia, committing heinous crimes. Only after China's eight-year War of Resistance and the arduous struggle of all Asian people, and especially due to the Soviet Union's entry into the war and the defeat of the ferocious Japanese Kwantung Army, were the Japanese fascists overthrown and forced to surrender unconditionally.
    When Japan signed the instrument of unconditional surrender on September 2, 1945, the Second World War was declared over, and people all over the world celebrated the restoration of peace. In particular, the people of Asia rejoiced at the demise of Japanese fascism, which would allow them to enjoy lasting peace and happiness. Who knew that the United States, one of the countries at war with Japan, was actually two-faced, harboring malicious intentions, violating the Potsdam Declaration and other international agreements, and plotting to revive Japanese fascism and rearm Japan. We, the entire Chinese people and all Asian people, unanimously and resolutely oppose this sinful act of breaking promises and undermining peace, and will never allow it to be realized.
    The US imperialist plot to arm Japan has not been a matter of a single day or night; it has been going on consistently since Japan's unconditional surrender. Now it is going to be carried out openly and blatantly, which makes it even more necessary for the entire Chinese people and all Asian people to unite to smash this major conspiratorial crime of US imperialism.
    MacArthur's leading the US Eighth Army to occupy and control Japan was originally under the joint commission of the Allied countries that fought against Japan. In the name of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, he occupied and controlled Japan to implement the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, disarm Japan, and finally transform Japan into a peaceful and democratic country. However, since MacArthur occupied Japan in September 1945, he has been violating the terms of the Potsdam Declaration and secretly rearming Japan. He expanded the Japanese police reserve to rebuild the Japanese army, used the Maritime Safety Agency to rebuild the Japanese navy, and used the Aviation Security Office to restore the Japanese air force. Japan's naval ports are well preserved, Japanese air force bases are being built everywhere, and Japanese military factories are operating day and night. Even so, US imperialism still does not think it is enough. Especially since its war of aggression against Korea has suffered successive defeats, it wants to rearm Japan on a large scale and openly. US imperialism is planning to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan. It wants to tear up all international agreements since World War II, conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, and then conclude a so-called "US-Japan military alliance" with the Japanese puppet government to allow the US military to continue to occupy Japan. At the same time, it will openly establish Japanese army, navy, and air forces, take the Japanese people as cannon fodder, and use them as capital to invade Korea, invade China, and conquer all Asian people. In order to defend Asian peace, and especially to defend the security of their own countries and the peace and happiness of individuals, the entire Chinese people and all Asian people unanimously and resolutely oppose US imperialism's rearming of Japan.
  The Chinese People Oppose It!
    Why do the Chinese people oppose US imperialism's rearming of Japan? Because China has suffered hundreds of years of Japanese aggression and harassment, especially in the past seventy years, China has been painfully subjected to Japanese aggression and oppression, almost to the point of national subjugation. After eight years of the War of Resistance, with more than ten million people shedding blood and sacrificing their lives, and five million US dollars worth of property being destroyed, the Japanese fascists were finally defeated and surrendered unconditionally. The roots of Japanese aggression could have been eradicated from then on. How can we tolerate the revival of Japanese fascism, rearming itself, and invading our China and massacring our people again?
    Please take a look at the blood debts of the Japanese fascists who massacred the Chinese people! Just a few important examples will show that these heinous Japanese fascists must never be allowed to revive in the human world.
    (1) The Lushun Massacre. During the Sino-Japanese War, on November 24, 1894, the Japanese army captured Lushun and launched a large-scale massacre, killing anyone they saw, sparing neither women nor children. All the Chinese people in Lushun were killed, leaving only thirty-six people. The reason why these thirty-six Chinese people were not killed was specifically to leave them to bury the bodies of their murdered compatriots. The Japanese beasts were so ferocious.
    (2) The Taiwan Massacre. After Japan seized Taiwan, it consistently used a policy of massacre to suppress the resistance of the Taiwanese people for decades. In the first three months of his tenure, the first Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, Kabayama Sukenori, had an average of six or seven Taiwanese people tied up and taken to the execution ground every day, their bodies exposed for several days before being thrown into the wilderness. The most inhumane thing was to use poison gas to massacre the indigenous people. On October 27, 1930, an uprising against Japanese rule broke out among the indigenous people of Taiwan. The Japanese guard mobilized to attack the indigenous people. In the deep mountains and valleys, the Japanese police went deep into the isolated areas and suffered many deaths. The Japanese Governor-General, Ishizuka Eizo, used vicious methods, building long walls to encircle them, and then mobilized more than a dozen planes to launch poisonous gas into the valleys to exterminate the indigenous people. More than 2,000 indigenous people died from poisoning in this campaign. Some of the indigenous people who escaped were also shot to death by machine guns surrounding them. The cruelty of the Japanese robbers was truly intolerable to heaven and earth.
    (3) The Nanjing Massacre. During the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan, the Nanjing Massacre was extremely appalling. On December 13, 1937, the Japanese army occupied Nanjing and began the massacre, killing more than 300,000 Chinese compatriots. They tied up Chinese people in strings of fifty, lined them up, and strafed them with guns. The Japanese beast army held killing contests. The banks of the Xiaguan River and the foothills of Zijin Mountain were all killing fields, and there were mass graves everywhere. Tens of thousands of rape cases occurred, and they were still killed after being raped. They burned alive 30,000 to 40,000 Chinese officers and soldiers who had not had time to evacuate. They ordered thousands of Chinese strongmen to tie each other up, and then stabbed them with swords, chopped them with knives, burned them, and buried them alive. Live burial was especially cruel. The mournful cries made the wind and clouds change color and the grass and trees mourn. The massacre in Nanjing continued for more than a month, and more than 300,000 people were massacred. How can we forget this hatred!
    (4) The Crime of Germ Warfare. Before 1936, Emperor Hirohito of Japan ordered Lieutenant General Shiro Ishii to establish a germ warfare unit in Northeast China, which was the so-called "Unit 731." This killing factory covered an area of 45 square miles. It not only produced large quantities of bacteria, but also used living people as experimental subjects, putting them to death alive. From 1940 to 1945, five or six years, as many as 3,000 people from Northeast China were sacrificed in this way. Since the summer of 1940, Japanese aircraft dropped plague bacteria in the Ningbo area of Zhejiang several times; that winter, they spread plague bacteria in the Jinhua area, and the plague spread, causing countless families to be destroyed in various places. Some families of twelve people were all infected and died. In 1941, plague bacteria were also spread in the Changde area of Hunan. In 1942, other types of bacteria were spread in the Central China region. On the eve of the liberation of Northeast China, Japan destroyed the factories that manufactured bacteria, and the plague bacteria spread everywhere. As a result, as many as 23,171 of our compatriots in Northeast China died from the epidemic. What a great crime this is!
    (5) The Hong Kong Massacre. Hong Kong was a colony seized by Britain, and the residents were mainly Chinese. After the Japanese army occupied Hong Kong, they carried out an inhumane massacre. The captain of the Japanese military police, Noma Kennosuke, used extremely cruel methods of killing. Dead people were often hung on trees. After torturing women, they were imprisoned in small boxes and then released hunting dogs to bite them, tearing the people to bloody pieces and killing them. They also forced the evacuation of citizens, exiling thousands upon thousands of people to barren islands where they starved to death. Rape of women and all kinds of torture. Reading the records in the newspapers today still makes people shudder.
    During the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan, more than 10 million Chinese soldiers and civilians were sacrificed under the butcher knives of the Japanese robbers. Of course, we cannot allow US imperialism to rearm Japan. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, we Chinese people defeated Japanese fascism, overthrew the Chiang Kai-shek gang, expelled the forces of imperialism, built a people's China, and embarked on the road of independence, democracy, peace, unity, prosperity, and strength. How can we tolerate US imperialism rearming Japan to destroy our peace and happiness and threaten our national security! We absolutely oppose US imperialism rearming Japan!
  The Asian People Oppose It!
    Why do the Asian people oppose US imperialism rearming Japan? Because many Asian countries have suffered from Japanese aggression and massacre. For example, the Korean people have suffered more than 50 years of national subjugation, of course they must oppose the revival of Japanese fascism. In the Pacific War, which began in 1941, many countries, including Burma, Vietnam, Malaya, Indonesia, and the Philippines, suffered from Japanese aggression and massacre. Even now, they are still scarred and bloodstained. Who can forget this deep hatred? Who can tolerate rearming Japan?
    Please take a look at the blood debts of the Japanese fascists who massacred the Asian people! Just a few important examples will show that the Asian people must never allow these heinous Japanese fascists to revive in the human world.
    (1) The Philippines Massacre. When the Japanese army attacked the Philippines, they first blindly bombed it with airplanes, causing heavy casualties among peaceful people. After landing, they launched a large-scale massacre. During the battle for Manila, countless Filipino people were massacred. Patients in the Red Cross hospital were all massacred by the Japanese army, and women and children all died miserably. Lieutenant General Yokoyama, the commander of the Japanese army in southern Luzon, alone committed the crime of massacring 45,000 civilians. Most of the overseas Chinese who were killed were killed with their entire families, leaving not even chickens or dogs alive. Another example is the famous "Bataan Death March." More than 16,000 American and Filipino soldiers who were captured after the fall of the Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor Fortress died from abuse. By the spring of 1945, when the Japanese army was defeated and withdrew from Manila, they systematically set fires and strafed the streets with machine guns. People either died in the fire or were killed by gunfire. Seven-tenths of the entire city was burned down. Can the Filipino people forget such pain?
    (2) The Malaya Massacre. The commander-in-chief of the Japanese army, Yamashita Tomoyuki, called himself the "Tiger of Malaya," and his ferocity can be imagined. Japanese robbers massacred 150,000 overseas Chinese in Malaya, and more Malay people were killed. They used barges to carry people from Singapore to St. John's Island, where they were shot and thrown into the water. They forced civilians to dig their own graves and then strafed them to death with machine guns. Thousands of people were driven into the jungle where they starved to death, and tens of thousands died from forced labor on the Thailand-Burma Railway. Yamashita Tomoyuki engaged in five major massacres, three in Singapore and two in the countryside of Johor, with mass graves everywhere.
    (3) Various Crimes of Murder. During the Pacific War, Japan occupied the entire territory of Burma, and there are countless massacres and destructions. When the Japanese army entered Indonesia, they carried out large-scale massacres in Sumatra and Medan. They also carried out long-term massacres in Vietnam. On Guam, the Japanese army killed prisoners of war and even cooked and ate human flesh. Just thinking about these things makes one shudder.
    In this way, the Asian people suffered from the Japanese fascists' massacre and destruction. The blood has not yet dried, and the ruins still exist. For the sake of their own safety, peace, and happiness, can they allow Japanese fascism to revive? Of course, they oppose US imperialism rearming Japan!
  The Japanese People Also Oppose It!
    Why do the Japanese people oppose US imperialism rearming Japan? Because the Japanese people followed their Meiji Emperor and the Japanese warlords, and as a result, they suffered a major defeat and a national tragedy. The current situation is that the country is destroyed and the family is ruined. The Japanese state is occupied by the US military, and the Japanese people are ruled by MacArthur. The Japanese people have suffered from the pain of defeat and national subjugation, and they know the tragic consequences of war. Therefore, they hate war and yearn for peace. They know that according to the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration, the new Japanese Constitution stipulates that there will be no army, navy, or air force. After the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty, the United Nations will jointly guarantee that Japan will forever be a peaceful and neutral country. In this way, the Japanese people will never pay military expenses, never serve as soldiers, and will always live a peaceful life. Now, US imperialism is planning a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan to be enemies with China, the Soviet Union, and all Asian people, and is immediately using the Japanese people as cannon fodder to help US imperialism engage in wars of aggression. In this way, Japan will fall into the tragedy of war, and because it will bear the brunt, Japan will be the first to be destroyed. The situation is clear, and the stakes are clear. Of course, the Japanese people oppose this dangerous conspiracy of US imperialism.
  The United States Has Always Supported Japanese Fascism
    US imperialism has always supported Japanese fascism, and we Chinese people are particularly clear about this. US imperialism has invaded China for more than 100 years, and in the history of Japanese aggression against China, US imperialism has often been the supporter behind Japan.
    Let's look at a few examples:
    (1) When Japanese warlords attacked Taiwan in 1874, American Li Xiande served as the staff officer of Saigo Takamori and used the American ship "New York" to transport troops to Japan.
    (2) During the Russo-Japanese War from 1904 to 1905, the United States made large amounts of war investment in Japan, bought Japanese stocks, and sold military equipment. At the end of the war, Theodore Roosevelt mediated the Portsmouth Conference, and the American railway tycoon Harriman went to Japan to buy all the ownership of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the South Manchurian Railway, hoping to reap the benefits.
    (3) In 1915, Japan forced China to sign the Sino-Japanese Treaty based on the Twenty-One Demands that would subjugate the country. In 1917, the United States and Japan concluded the Lansing-Ishii Agreement, in which the United States "recognizes that Japan has special interests in China, especially in areas bordering Japan." This is the United States supporting Japanese aggression.
    (4) During the Japanese war of aggression against China, which began in 1937, the United States supplied Japan with large amounts of war materials. Airplanes, gasoline, scrap iron, and other military supplies were sold to Japan in large quantities as weapons to massacre China. It only stopped after the Pearl Harbor Incident broke out at the end of 1941. Roosevelt once publicly said, "The United States sells steel and gasoline to Japan in order to prevent Japan from invading Southeast Asia." What is this all about?
  We Can Smash the Conspiracy of US Imperialism
    Now US imperialism is even more frantic. It wants to unilaterally tear up all international agreements since World War II, unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan, and rearm Japan as its tool of aggression, using the Japanese people as cannon fodder to massacre Chinese people again and massacre Asian people again. All of us Chinese people, all Asian people, including Japan, unanimously and resolutely oppose this conspiratorial crime of US imperialism.
    The US imperialist plot to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan completely violates international agreements such as the United Nations Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration. We have full power to oppose this conspiratorial crime of US imperialism. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, 475 million Chinese people have been liberated and stood up. We have sufficient strength to smash this conspiratorial crime of US imperialism. Not only that, the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance is to prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression, and to prevent any country from directly or indirectly colluding with Japan to re-invade and destroy peace. The great unity of 700 million people, combined with the strength of all Asian people, is invincible in the world. In the face of this unparalleled force for defending peace, the US imperialist plot to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan will surely be crushed, and it will never have the slightest luck!
    Now, we are holding a national referendum. Please cast your own vote, patriotic people across the country:
    (1) Oppose the United States arming Japan and oppose the United States unilaterally concluding a peace treaty with Japan!
    (2) Advocate the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and promote the peace and democracy of the Japanese people.

　　中国人民和全亚洲人民为什么反对美国重新武装日本？
　　王芸生
    日本法西斯，侵略中国，屠杀亚洲人民，罪恶滔天，好不容易经中国的八年抗战和全亚洲人民的艰苦奋斗，更由于苏联的参战，打垮了凶恶的日本关东军，才把日本法西斯打倒，迫令他无条件投降。
    当一九四五年九月二日日本签无条件投降书的时候，第二次世界大战宣告结束，全世界人民欢庆和平恢复；尤其全亚洲人民欢庆日本法西斯灭亡，从此得以永享和平的幸福。谁知道对日作战国家之一的美国，竟然口是心非，包藏祸心，破坏波茨坦公告等国际协定，阴谋复活日本法西斯，进行重新武装日本。这种毁约败信、破坏和平的罪恶行为，我们全中国人民和全亚洲人民都一致坚决反对，绝不容许其实现。
    美国帝国主义进行武装日本的阴谋，已非一朝一夕，自从日本无条件投降以来就在一贯地进行，现在更要明目张胆地公开进行，这就更需要全中国人民和全亚洲人民一致起来粉碎美帝国主义这一重大阴谋的罪行。
    麦克阿瑟率领美国第八军占领并管制日本，原是受对日作战的同盟国家的共同委任，以盟军最高统帅的名义，占领并管制日本，执行波茨坦公告的条款，解除日本的武装，最后把日本改造成为和平民主的国家。但是，麦克阿瑟自从一九四五年九月占领日本以来，就一直违反波茨坦公告的条款，暗地里重新武装日本。他扩充日本的警察后备队以重建日本陆军，以海上保安队重建日本的海军，以航空保安厅恢复日本的空军，日本的军港均完好存在着，日本的空军基地到处修建着，日本的军需工厂日夜开工着。就是这样，美帝国主义还认为不够，尤其在它的侵朝战争连续遭受失败以来，更要大量地公开地重新武装日本，美帝国主义正在策划对日单独媾和，它就是想撕毁第二次世界大战以来的一切国际协定，对日单独媾和，然后与日本傀儡政府订立一个所谓“美日军事同盟”，使美军继续占领日本，同时公开建立日本陆海空军，拿日本人民当炮灰，做它侵略朝鲜、侵略中国、并征服全亚洲人民的本钱。全中国人民和全亚洲人民为了保卫亚洲和平，尤其为了保卫自己国家的安全及个人的和平幸福，一致坚决反对美国帝国主义重新武装日本。
  中国人民反对！
    中国人民为什么要反对美帝国主义重新武装日本？因为中国曾经遭受日本几百年的侵略骚扰，尤其近七十年来痛受日本的侵略压迫，几乎到了亡国的惨境，血海深仇，数不清的血债，好不容易经过八年抗战，一千多万人以上流血牺牲，五百万万美元的财产遭受毁灭，才把日本法西斯打倒，无条件投降，日本的侵略的根株原本可以从此拔掉了，我们怎么可以容忍日本法西斯复活，重新武装起来，再来侵略我们中国屠杀我们人民呢？
    请看看日本法西斯屠杀中国人民的血账吧！只举几个重要的例子，就会知道这万恶的日本法西斯是绝对不能容许其复活于人间的了。
    （一）旅顺大屠杀。甲午战争之役，一八九四年十一月二十四日，日军攻陷旅顺，就大举屠杀，见人就杀，妇孺不留，全旅顺的中国人被杀光，只剩下三十六个人。这三十六个中国人之所以不杀，是特地留下掩埋被害同胞尸体的。日本野兽就是这样的凶狠。
    （二）台湾大屠杀。日本割取了台湾之后，几十年来一贯的是用屠杀政策以镇压台湾人民的反抗。日本第一任台湾总督桦山资纪初入台湾的三个月，平均每天有六七个台湾人被绑赴刑场处死，曝尸数日，然后投诸荒野。最灭绝人道的是以毒气屠杀高山族的人民。一九三○年十月二十七日台湾发生了高山族反抗日本统治的暴动，日本警备队动员攻打高山族，在深山穷谷间，日警孤军深入，死亡很多，日本总督石冢英藏竟下毒手，筑长墙以围困，然后动员十几架飞机，发射毒瓦斯于各山谷，以使高山族人灭种。是役受毒而死的高山族二千余人，一部分逃出的高山人，也遭长围的机关枪扫射而死。日本强盗的惨毒，真为天地所不容。
    （三）南京大屠杀。在中国的八年抗战中，南京大屠杀是惨绝人寰的。一九三七年十二月十三日日军占领了南京，就开始了大屠杀，共杀死中国同胞三十多万人。他们把中国人一串一串地捆绑起来，每串五十名，排成行列，用枪扫射。日本兽军作杀人竞赛，下关江边，紫金山下，都是杀人场，到处是万人坑。强奸案多至数万起，强奸之后仍是杀死。他们曾用火烧死中国未及撤退的官兵三四万人。他们曾令成千的中国壮丁互相捆绑，然后剑刺、刀劈、火焚、活埋。活埋尤其残酷，那种阴惨的叫喊，真使风云变色，草木含悲。南京的屠杀继续了一个多月，三十多万人被屠杀。这仇恨我们怎么会忘记！
    （四）细菌战的罪恶。在一九三六年以前，日皇裕仁就命令石井四郎中将在我东北成立细菌部队，那就是所谓“七三一部队”。这一个杀人的工厂占地四十五方里，不仅生产大量的细菌，还把活人当试验品，活活处死。自一九四○至一九四五的五、六年中，这样被牺牲的东北人民有三千人之多。一九四○年夏天以来，日本飞机几次在浙江宁波地区投下鼠疫细菌；那年冬天又在金华一带散布鼠疫细菌，瘟疫传播开来，各地家破人亡的不知有多少，有的一家十二口均遭传染而死。一九四一年在湖南、常德地区也散布了鼠疫细菌。一九四二年在华中地区更散布其他种的细菌。在东北解放前夕，日本破坏制造细菌的工厂，疫病细菌散播各地，因此我东北同胞染疫而死的达二万三千一百七十一人之众，这是多么大的罪恶！
    （五）香港大屠杀。香港是英国抢去的殖民地，居民主要是中国人，日军攻占香港之后，即进行惨无人道的大屠杀。日本宪兵队长野间贤之助，杀人的方法异常残忍，树上经常吊着死人，刑殴妇女之后，囚入小箱，再放出猎犬狂咬，把人咬得血肉模糊而死。又强迫疏散市民，把成千成万的人放逐于荒岛上饥饿而死。奸淫妇女，种种酷刑，今天重读报纸上的纪录，犹令人不寒而栗。
    在八年抗战中，就是这样，我们中国军民一千多万人牺牲在日本强盗的屠刀之下，我们当然不能容许美帝国主义再把日本重新武装起来。我们中国人民，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下，战胜了日本法西斯，打垮了蒋匪帮，驱逐了帝国主义的势力，建设起人民的中国，走上独立、民主、和平、统一与富强的道路，我们岂能容忍美帝国主义重新武装日本再来破坏我们的和平幸福，威胁我们的国家安全！我们绝对反对美帝国主义重新武装日本！
  亚洲人民反对！
    亚洲人民为什么要反对美帝国主义重新武装日本？因为许多亚洲国家都曾经遭受日本的侵略屠杀。像朝鲜人民曾经受过五十多年的亡国痛苦，当然要反对日本法西斯的复活。在由一九四一年开始的太平洋战争中，缅甸、越南、马来亚、印度尼西亚、菲律宾这许多国家都曾遭受过日本的侵略屠杀，到现在还疮痍满目，血迹斑斑，谁能忘记这血海深仇？谁能容忍再把日本武装起来？
    请看看日本法西斯屠杀亚洲人民的血账吧！只举几个重要的例子，就会知道亚洲人民是绝对不能容许这万恶的日本法西斯复活于人间的了。
    （一）菲律宾大屠杀。日军攻打菲律宾的时候，先是飞机盲目轰炸，和平人民死伤累累。登陆之后，就是大屠杀。在马尼拉争夺战中菲律宾人民被屠杀的难以数计，红十字会医院的病人都被日军屠杀光，妇女小孩一律惨死。吕宋南部日军司令横山中将一个人就有屠杀四万五千平民的罪行。华侨被杀的，大多是全家被杀害，鸡犬不留。又如著名的“八打雁死亡游行”，八打雁半岛及科里基多要塞陷落后被俘的美军及菲军，因不堪虐待而死的有一万六千余人。到一九四五年春天，日军战败撤出马尼拉时，他们有计划地放火焚烧，并沿街以机关枪扫射，人民不死于火，即死于枪杀，全城焚毁十分之七。这样的惨痛，菲律宾人民能忘记吗？
    （二）马来亚大屠杀。日军总司令山下奉文自号“马来之虎”，其凶残可知。日本强盗在马来亚屠杀华侨十五万人，马来亚人民被杀的更多。他们用驳船把新加坡人民载至圣约翰岛，予以枪杀，投入水中。迫令平民自掘墓穴，然后以机枪扫射而死。被驱至丛林中饥饿生毙的有几千人，被迫至泰国缅甸铁路做苦工而死的有几万人。山下奉文曾从事五次大屠杀，三次在新加坡，两次在柔佛乡间，到处是万人坑。
    （三）种种杀人罪行。在太平洋战争期间，日本曾占领了缅甸的全境，屠杀破坏，多不胜记。日军攻入印尼，在苏门答腊，在棉兰，都曾进行过大屠杀。在越南，也进行过长期的屠杀。日军在关岛，杀戮战俘，并且有煮食人肉的惨事。想想这些事情就令人毛骨悚然。
    就是这样，亚洲人民痛遭日本法西斯的屠杀破坏，血迹未干，废墟犹存，他们为了自己的生命安全，和平幸福，能让日本法西斯复活吗？当然反对美帝国主义重新武装日本！
  日本人民也反对！
    日本人民为什么要反对美帝国主义重新武装日本？因为日本人民跟着他们的明治天皇走，跟着日本军阀走，结果弄成大失败，演成亡国的惨祸。现在的情况是国破家亡，日本国家给美国军队占领着，日本人民被麦克阿瑟统治着。日本人民受到战败亡国的苦痛，晓得了战争后果的悲惨，所以他们痛恨战争，渴望和平。他们知道根据波茨坦公告的精神，日本新宪法规定不设陆海空军，全面和约缔结之后，由联合国共同保证日本永为和平中立的国家。这样，日本人民将永远不出军费、永远不当兵，永远过和平的生活。现在美帝国主义策动对日单独媾和，重新武装日本，以与中国苏联为敌，与全亚洲人民为敌，并且即用日本人民做炮灰，帮助美帝国主义从事侵略战争，这样，日本将陷于战争惨祸，且以首当其冲之故，日本必将首先毁灭。形势显然，利害分明，日本人民当然反对美帝国主义这一危险的阴谋。
  美国一向支持日本法西斯
    美帝国主义一向支持日本法西斯，对于这一点，我们中国人民特别认识清楚。美帝国主义侵略中国一百多年，而在日本侵略中国的历史中，美国帝国主义也常是日本背后的支持者。
    举几个例看：
    （一）一八七四年日本军阀攻打台湾，美国人李仙得做西乡从道的参谋，并以美国船“纽约”号给日本运兵。
    （二）一九○四年至一九○五年的日俄战争，美国对日本作大量的战争投资，收买日本的股票，出卖军械。到战争结束时，老罗斯福一面调停扑资茅斯会议，一面美国铁路大王哈里曼到日本去收买中东铁路和南满铁路的所有权，以冀坐收渔人之利。
    （三）一九一五年日本强迫中国订立二十一条亡国要求为基础的中日条约，至一九一七年美日缔结《蓝辛石井协定》，美国“承认日本于中国有特殊之利益，而于日本所属接壤地方尤为其然。”是美国支持日本的侵略。
    （四）一九三七年开始的日本侵华战争，美国以大量的战争物资供给日本。飞机、汽油、废铁及其他军用物资，大量出售给日本，作为屠杀中国的武器。直到一九四一年末珍珠港事变爆发后才停止。罗斯福曾公开地说：“美国把钢铁汽油卖给日本，是为了使日本不向南洋侵略。”请问这是什么话？
  我们能够粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋
    现在美帝国主义更加丧心病狂，想一手撕毁第二次世界大战以来的一切国际协定，单独对日媾和，重新把日本武装起来，作为他的侵略工具，拿日本人民做炮灰，再来屠杀中国人，再来屠杀亚洲人；我们全中国人民，全亚洲人民，包括日本在内，一致坚决反对美帝国主义这一阴谋罪行。
    美帝国主义阴谋单独对日媾和，重新武装日本，完全违反联合国宣言波茨坦公告等国际协定，我们有十足的权力反对美帝国主义这一阴谋罪行。四亿七千五百万中国人民，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下，获得解放了，站立起来了，我们有足够的力量粉碎美帝国主义这一阴谋罪行。非但如此，中苏友好同盟，就是为了制止日本侵略的再起，就是为了制止任何国家直接间接与日本相勾结起来重新侵略与破坏和平。七万万人的大团结，同时结合全亚洲人民的力量，是无敌天下的。在这强大无比的保卫和平的力量的面前，美帝国主义单独对日媾和与重新武装日本的阴谋一定归于粉碎，绝不使他有丝毫的侥幸！
    现在，我们正在举行全国民意投票，请全国的爱国人民投你自己的一票：
    （一）反对美国武装日本，反对美国单独对日媾和！
    （二）主张签订全面的对日和约，促进日本人民的和平、民主。
    （按：此文系四月十九日在中央人民广播电台发表的广播词）
