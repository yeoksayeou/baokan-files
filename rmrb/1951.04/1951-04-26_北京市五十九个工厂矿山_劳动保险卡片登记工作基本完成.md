Beijing’s Fifty-Nine Factories and Mines
　  Basically Complete Labor Insurance Card Registration Work

    The card registration work for factories and mines approved to implement labor insurance in Beijing has been basically completed. As of April, 59 units including the Beijing Tram Company, Beijing Automobile Repair Factory, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, China People's Printing Factory, and Beijing Garment Factory have carried out labor insurance card registration. Eighteen units including the Electric Power Administration Bureau, the Mechanical Plant of the Sanitary Engineering Bureau, and the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau are now starting card registration due to later approval.

    In order to prepare for the implementation of labor insurance, the Labor Insurance Department of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and the Beijing Labor Bureau held a city-wide labor insurance training class to train cadres, and formulated a labor insurance work plan for April, requiring factories to do a good job in publicity, organization, and card registration. They also selected the Beijing Tram Company Repair Factory for key experiments. The industrial work committees of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions also selected key factories to assist in this work, promptly understanding the situation and solving specific problems.

    After the city-wide labor insurance training class ended, the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League of each factory concentrated their efforts to carry out preparatory work, and generally held short-term amateur labor insurance training classes. Labor insurance committees were also established in each unit's trade union. Many units were able to combine the current affairs education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, using wall posters, cartoons, blackboards, broadcasts, speeches, discussions, grievance meetings, large classes, and general meetings of workers and staff to carry out labor insurance publicity and mobilization work. Labor insurance cadres of the Chengzi Mine of Mentougou Coal Mine in western Beijing also went to workers' homes, hospitals, and mine entrances to carry out publicity. Each factory also selected key groups or key workshops to assist, in order to break through a point and drive the overall situation. Some workers had low cultural levels and could not fill out card drafts, so the trade union organized them to help each other.

    However, the leadership of some units did not pay enough attention to the card registration work. One factory, without in-depth publicity and group discussion, asked everyone to fill out card drafts, and as a result, none of the more than 800 workers in the factory filled them out correctly. This not only failed to complete the preparation work for the implementation of labor insurance, but also aroused dissatisfaction among the workers. The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions is now paying attention to correcting this deviation.

### 北京市五十九个工厂矿山  劳动保险卡片登记工作基本完成

　　北京市五十九个工厂矿山
　  劳动保险卡片登记工作基本完成
    北京市被批准实行劳动保险的工厂、矿山卡片登记工作基本完成。截至四月为止，已有北京电车公司、北京汽车修配厂、石景山钢铁厂、中国人民印刷厂、北京被服厂等五十九个单位，进行了劳动保险卡片登记工作。电业管理总局、卫生工程局机械厂、钢铁工业局等十八个单位，因被批准较晚，现正开始进行卡片登记工作。
    北京市总工会劳动保险部为了做好实行劳动保险的准备工作，和北京市劳动局举办了全市的劳动保险训练班，训练干部，并订出了四月份的劳动保险工作计划，要求各厂做好宣传组织和卡片登记工作。又选择北京电车公司修造厂进行了重点试验。北京市总工会各产业工作委员会为配合这一工作，也选择了重点厂进行帮助，及时了解情况，解决具体问题。
    全市的劳动保险训练班结束后，各厂的党、行政、工会、青年团集中力量，进行准备工作，普遍地举办了短期的业余劳动保险训练班。各单位工会并建立了劳动保险委员会。很多单位都能结合抗美援朝的时事教育，运用大字报、漫画、黑板报、广播、讲演、座谈会、诉苦会、上大课、职工全体大会等方式，进行劳动保险的宣传动员工作。京西门头沟煤矿城子矿劳动保险干事等还到职工家里、病院、井口进行宣传。各厂还选择重点组或重点车间进行帮助，以便突破一点带动全面。有些工人文化水平低，不会填写卡片草稿，工会就组织他们互助。
    但有个别单位领导上对卡片登记工作重视不够，有一个厂子没有经过深入宣传和小组讨论，就叫大家填写卡片草稿，结果全厂八百多职工，没有一个填对的。这样不但不能完成实施劳动保险的准备工作，而且还引起工人群众的不满。现在北京市总工会正在注意纠正这个偏向。
