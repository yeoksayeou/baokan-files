The signature and voting campaign of people from all walks of life in Jinan was combined with listening to the East China People's celebration of the "May 1st" Labor Day broadcast meeting. In just two days, the 25th and 26th of this month, the number of participants in the signature and voting reached 200,000, accounting for about 30 percent of the city's residents.

In more than ten counties in Chahar Province and rural areas in Xiyang and Fenxi counties in Shanxi Province, more than 85% of farmers have signed and voted. The enthusiastic signatures and votes of people from all over the world were carried out on the basis of extensive accusation meetings, memorial services, and symposiums to improve their political awareness. Elderly people who suffered from the massacre by Japanese invaders in Panjiayu, Panjiadaizhuang, Huoshiying and other villages in Hebei Province rushed to Tangshan City to participate in the accusation broadcast meeting. In Tianzhen County, Chahar Province, which was looted by Japanese invaders in 1937, more than 2,500 people cried bitterly while accusing at the accusation meeting. After the meeting, more than 4,700 people in the city signed and voted. The workers of Pangjiabao Mine recalled the tragic deaths of more than 8,000 worker brothers. They shouted: "The history of 'Ten Thousand People Pit,' 'No Man's Land,' and 'Human Circle' must not be allowed to repeat itself. We resolutely oppose the United States arming Japan." Under the mood of extreme grief and indignation, everyone enthusiastically signed and voted.
　　As of the 25th, according to incomplete statistics in Shenyang, 566,000 workers, farmers, students, women, industrialists and businessmen, religious figures, ethnic minorities and street residents had signed and voted, accounting for about one-third of the city's population. This movement is continuing to deepen and expand. In order to enable many people who cannot attend the gatherings to have the opportunity to sign and vote, the students of various middle and primary schools in the city have also organized mobile signature and voting collection groups to carry out publicity at traffic arteries or remote Hutongs.
