　　Various Places Continue to Respond to Li Shunda's Production Increase Competition
    Many Mutual Aid Teams Petition Chairman Mao, Guaranteeing the Competition Will Have Inspections and Summaries
    Agricultural labor models and production mutual aid teams in various places continue to respond to the patriotic production increase challenge from the Li Shunda mutual aid team in Shanxi, and have launched patriotic production increase competitions in their respective regions. In Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, and the Northeast provinces, several special districts and counties have convened meetings of labor models or advanced mutual aid teams to specifically discuss the issue of responding to the Li Shunda mutual aid team's challenge and launching patriotic production increase campaigns in their regions. Due to the government's attention to leadership and the exemplary promotion of labor models, a surge in the production increase competition campaign has formed in the aforementioned areas. After the Tianjin Special District in Hebei convened a conference of labor models from across the district, the Zhang Wansheng mutual aid team, a labor model in Yongqing County, took the lead in responding to the challenge from the Li Shunda mutual aid team and challenged mutual aid teams throughout the district, sparking production increase competitions among mutual aid teams in various counties. In most counties and districts of Shanxi, not only has the production increase competition of the vast number of mutual aid teams been launched, but inspection and evaluation committees have also been organized to focus on grasping certain advanced mutual aid teams, guiding and promoting the development of the movement. For example, Yuci County first convened a meeting of twenty-four advanced production mutual aid team leaders, headed by the famous labor model Zhang Zhiquan, to discuss the issue of launching production competitions. The county has also formed a competition inspection and evaluation committee composed of the Secretary of the Yuci County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Yuci County Chief, the Director of the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the Head of the County Agriculture Section, to provide specific guidance and resolve difficulties in the competition. Zhang Zhiquan and the other twenty-four advanced mutual aid teams have petitioned Chairman Mao, guaranteeing that the competition will have inspections and summaries, and that the final results will be published in the newspaper. Under the leadership of these advanced mutual aid teams, the county's competition campaign has been launched in a planned manner.
    In their letters of challenge to Li Shunda, labor models and mutual aid teams in various places confidently put forward plans for increased cotton and grain production. With the exception of mutual aid teams in individual disaster areas (such as northern Anhui and parts of Chahar), most challenging mutual aid teams have proposed to increase grain production by about 10% per mu compared to last year, with many mutual aid teams proposing increases of 20% or more. For example, the Jin Shilong mutual aid team, a special-class agricultural labor model in Jilin, guarantees that this year each hectare of paddy field will produce 8,000 jin of grain, exceeding last year's production by more than 20%. The Fu Jingcai mutual aid team, a special-class labor model in Heilongjiang Province, plans to produce 2,760 jin of grain per hectare this year, exceeding the normal yield by 58%. Regarding cotton production plans, the mutual aid teams participating in the competition in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and other places have guaranteed to produce 120 to 200 jin of seed cotton per mu. In some areas with a better production base and conditions, such as the Handan Special District in Hebei, seventy-eight labor models petitioned Chairman Mao, proposing to create a record this year of 1,400 jin of grain and 700 jin of cotton per mu of paddy field, and 400 jin of grain and 500 jin of cotton per mu of dry land. The increase in production planned by most mutual aid teams participating in the competition in the old liberated areas exceeds the production level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. The Shi Niu Di mutual aid team in Licheng, Shanxi, guarantees to produce 435 jin of grain per mu, exceeding the pre-war level by 100.2%.
    In order to achieve the production increase plan, all the mutual aid teams participating in the competition have come up with many specific methods in terms of processing and adding fertilizer, and improving cultivation techniques. In terms of fertilization, many mutual aid teams are prepared to use multiple methods such as accumulating more soil, diligently padding livestock pens, fermenting grass fertilizer, pressing green manure, digging manure pits, utilizing human urine, and using sheep trampling to expand fertilizer sources. Because of last year's bumper harvest, mutual aid teams in various places have the strength to purchase more fine fertilizers such as bean cake, sesame cake, and fertilizer powder, which is a powerful guarantee for achieving increased production. In terms of cultivation, in order to be able to plow and hoe more and cultivate intensively and carefully, many mutual aid teams are prepared to mobilize women to participate in field production, and many mutual aid teams are prepared to use new-style farm implements—walking plows, weeding machines, etc.—to improve cultivation efficiency. In terms of preventing diseases and eliminating insect pests, the mutual aid teams in various places have decided to implement seed dressing with pesticides, warm water seed soaking, prepare pesticides for timely prevention and treatment of diseases and insect pests, and rake up the stubble and weeds in the cultivated land before cultivation and burn them to eliminate insect eggs. In addition, all the mutual aid teams participating in the competition unanimously proposed to select superior varieties to ensure a good harvest.
    The mutual aid teams in various places have undergone rectification in response to the challenge from the Li Shunda mutual aid team. Scientific division of labor has been carried out within the teams according to each person's expertise, and technical research groups have been established or special personnel have been assigned to provide technical guidance to the entire team. Many mutual aid teams have also established an internal public accumulation fund system (i.e., extracting a percentage of the harvest as public savings), which can not only solve some of the difficulties faced by team members in this year's production, but also, because of the public accumulation fund, can purchase large-scale agricultural implements and increase livestock that cannot be purchased with individual strength, which prepares more favorable conditions for the mutual aid teams to expand reproduction in the future.

　　各地继续响应李顺达丰产竞赛
    许多互助组上书毛主席保证竞赛作到有检查有总结
    各地农业劳动模范及生产互助组继续响应山西李顺达互助组的爱国丰产挑战，并在本地区内开展了爱国丰产竞赛。在河北、山西、山东、河南及东北各省，若干专区、县曾召集劳动模范或先进互助组开会，专门讨论向李顺达互助组应战展开本区的爱国丰产竞赛运动问题。由于政府注意领导及劳动模范的带头推动，丰产竞赛运动在上述各地已形成热潮。河北天津专区在召开全区的劳动模范会议以后，永清县劳动模范张万生互助组首先向李顺达互助组应战并向全专区互助组挑战，掀起了各县互助组的丰产竞赛。在山西大部县区，不仅发动了广大互助组的丰产竞赛，并组织了检查评判委员会，有重点地掌握某些先进互助组，指导和推动运动的向前发展。如榆社县首先召开了以著名劳动模范张志全为首的二十四个先进生产互助组组长会议，讨论展开生产竞赛问题。该县并已由中共榆社县委书记、榆社县长，县供销合作社主任、县府农业科长等组成了竞赛检查评判委员会，具体指导与解决竞赛中的困难问题。张志全等二十四个先进互助组已上书毛主席，保证竞赛做到有检查、有总结，并将最后结果在报上公布，在这些先进互助组的带动下，该县的竞赛运动已有计划地开展起来。
    各地劳动模范和互助组在给李顺达的应战书中，都充满信心地提出了棉粮增产计划。除个别灾区（如皖北及察哈尔部分地区）的互助组外，一般应战互助组都提出粮食要比去年每亩增产一成左右，不少的互助组提出增产二成以上。如吉林特等农业劳动模范金时龙互助组保证今年每垧水田产八千斤粮食，超过去年二成以上。黑龙江省特等劳动模范傅景财互助组计划今年每垧产粮二千七百六十斤，超过常年应产量的百分之五十八。棉花的生产计划，在河北、河南、山东等地参加竞赛的互助组都保证每亩产籽棉一百二、三十斤至二百斤。在某些生产基础和生产条件较好的地区，如河北邯郸专区，七十八个劳动模范上书毛主席，提出今年要创造每亩水田产粮一千四百斤、产棉七百斤，旱地产粮四百斤、产棉五百斤的丰产纪录。大部分老解放区参加竞赛的互助组，增产计划都超过抗日战争以前的生产水平。山西黎城石牛弟互助组保证每亩产粮四百三十五斤，超过战前水平百分之一百点二。
    为了实现增产计划，所有参加竞赛的互助组都在加工加肥，提高耕作技术等方面想出许多具体办法。在施肥方面，许多互助组都准备用多积土、勤垫圈、沤草肥、压绿肥、挖粪坑、利用人尿及羊踩圈等办法以扩大肥料来源。因为去年农作物丰收，各地互助组都有力量增购豆饼、麻饼、肥田粉等细肥，这是达到增产的有力保证。在耕作方面，为了能够多犁多锄，精耕细作，许多互助组都准备发动妇女参加田间生产，许多互助组准备使用新式农具——步犁、锄草机等以提高耕作效率。在防病除虫害方面，各地互助组决定实行药剂拌种、温汤浸种，准备好除虫药剂以便及时除治病虫害而外，并在耕作之前搂净耕地谷茬、杂草，用火烧掉以消灭虫卵。此外，所有参加竞赛的互助组一致提出选种优良品种以保证丰收。
    各地互助组在向李顺达互助组应战当中都进行了整顿。组内都按各人特长进行了科学分工，并建立了技术研究小组或设专人对全组进行技术指导。许多互助组并建立了组内的公积金制度（即抽出收获物的百分之几作为公共储蓄），不仅能解决组员在今年生产中的某些困难问题，而且因为有了公积金，可以购买个人力量所不能购置的大型农具及增加牲畜，这给互助组今后扩大再生产准备了更加有利的条件。
