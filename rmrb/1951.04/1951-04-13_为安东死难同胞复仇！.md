　　Avenge Our Compatriots Who Died in Andong!
    Following the bombings and strafing of our territory in Andong, Kuandian, Linjiang, and Ji'an on March 30, March 31, and April 7, the American aggressors once again dispatched more than 70 aircraft on April 12 to invade the airspace over Andong City, wantonly bombing the urban and suburban areas, dropping more than 110 bombs, and madly slaughtering our peaceful residents. This inhuman and brutal act by American imperialism once again proves that it is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. This bloodthirsty robber has destroyed countless cities and villages in Korea, slaughtering hundreds of thousands, even millions, of Korean men, women, and children, and is now constantly bombing cities and villages in Northeast China, further expanding its scope of murder and arson. The facts written in blood tell us that as long as the American aggressors continue to occupy Korea and persist in military adventures, the Chinese people will not be able to live peaceful and tranquil lives. We express our deep condolences to the compatriots who have suffered, and call on the people of the whole country to remember this blood debt, to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea a hundredfold, and together with the Korean people, to completely defeat the American aggressors, to avenge the victims! Avenge those compatriots whose parents, brothers, sisters, and children were taken away by the American bandits!

　　为安东死难同胞复仇！
    美国侵略者继三月三十日、三十一日和四月七日轰炸扫射我国领土安东、宽甸、临江、辑安等地后，又于十二日派遣飞机七十余架侵入我安东市上空，在市区和市郊滥肆轰炸，投弹一百十多枚，疯狂地屠杀我和平居民。美帝国主义的这种绝灭人性的残暴行为，再一次证明它是中国人民的死敌。这个嗜杀成性的强盗，毁灭了朝鲜的无数城市和乡村，屠杀了成十万、成百万朝鲜的男女老幼，现在又不断地轰炸我国东北的城市和乡村，进一步地扩大它的杀人放火范围。血的事实告诉我们：只要美国侵略者继续盘踞朝鲜，坚持军事冒险，中国人民就无法过和平安宁的日子。我们对于被难同胞表示深沉的哀悼，并号召全国人民记住这一血海深仇，百倍地加强抗美援朝工作，与朝鲜人民一起，彻底打败美国侵略者，为被害者复仇！为那些被美国强盗夺去了父母、兄弟、姐妹、子女的同胞复仇！
