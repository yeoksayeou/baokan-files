　　Beijing Catholic Anti-American and Aid-Korea Association Established
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Beijing Catholic Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression held its inaugural meeting on the 15th. Father Liu Fudong presided over the meeting. More than 1,000 Catholics attended. Cui Yueli, Deputy Secretary-General of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression, attended and gave a speech. The meeting adopted the committee's articles of association, a list of committee members and standing committee members, formulated a patriotic pact for Catholics in Beijing, signed in support of the Five-Power Peace Pact, voted against US imperialism's separate peace treaty with Japan and the rearmament of Japan, passed the declaration of the meeting, and passed a message of respect to Chairman Mao and a message of respect to the Chinese and Korean People's fighters.
    In his speech, Cui Yueli pointed out that if we want peace, we must resist America and aid Korea. Today's inaugural meeting demonstrates the determination of Catholics to resist America and aid Korea. Cui Yueli finally emphasized: Catholics must resist America and aid Korea. First, they must implement the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, sever ties with imperialism, and reject the dirty money of imperialism. Second, they must widely and deeply publicize the significance of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement among Catholics and criticize incorrect thinking among Catholics. Third, they must study current affairs and have a correct understanding of current affairs, and not adopt an indifferent attitude.

　　北京天主教抗美援朝会成立
    【本报讯】北京市天主教保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会十五日举行成立大会。大会由刘福栋神甫主持，到会教徒一千多人，中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会北京市分会副秘书长崔月犁出席指导并讲话。大会通过了委员会简章，委员会委员和常务委员名单；制订了北京市天主教徒爱国公约；签名拥护五大国缔结和平公约；投票反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和及重新武装日本；通过了大会的宣言；并通过向毛主席致敬电，和向中朝人民战士致敬电。
    崔月犁在讲话中指出，我们要和平，就要抗美援朝。今天的成立大会，就表现出天主教徒抗美援朝的决心。崔月犁最后强调指出：天主教徒要抗美援朝，第一要实行三自革新运动，斩断与帝国主义的联系，不要帝国主义的臭钱；第二要在教徒内普遍深入地宣传三自革新运动的意义，并批判教徒中的不正确思想。第三要学习时事，对时事要有正确的认识，不要采取漠不关心的态度。
