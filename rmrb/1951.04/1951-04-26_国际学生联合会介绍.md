Introduction to the International Union of Students

　　In August 1946, the First World Student Congress was held in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, and the International Union of Students was officially established. For the past five years, in accordance with the guidelines stipulated in its charter, the International Union of Students has been uniting students around the world in the struggle against imperialism and for lasting peace, national independence, and democratic education, contributing its strength to the consolidation and expansion of the world's peace and democracy camp.

　　The International Union of Students has consistently and resolutely supported the cause of peace throughout the world. It has continuously called on students around the world to fight for peace and to stop imperialist aggression. When American imperialism launched a frenzied war of aggression in Korea, the International Union of Students appealed to students of all countries to support the Korean youth and students and demanded a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The International Union of Students actively participates in the worldwide peace movement. It has sent representatives to all previous World Peace Congresses and has become an important member of the organization. After the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress launched the Stockholm Appeal peace signature campaign last year, the International Union of Students mobilized students from all countries to respond enthusiastically and awarded peace banners to outstanding signature collectors. When the first World Peace Council meeting in February this year made ten resolutions, including "Conclusion of a Peace Pact Among the Five Great Powers" and "Opposition to the Arming of West Germany and Japan," the International Union of Students immediately called on students around the world to fight for their realization. The International Union of Students has long resolutely opposed the militarization of schools, education, and research, and opposed imperialist war propaganda.

　　In August 1949, the International Union of Students and the World Federation of Democratic Youth jointly organized the Second World Youth and Student Festival in Budapest. This year, it will again join the World Federation of Democratic Youth to organize the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival in Berlin from August 5th to 19th, calling on all upright youth and students to enthusiastically participate in this grand peace demonstration and jointly strive for lasting peace.

　　The International Union of Students regards supporting the struggle of students in colonial and dependent countries for national liberation as one of its important tasks. In early 1947, the International Union of Students and the World Federation of Democratic Youth organized the "Southeast Asia Visiting Group," bringing the sympathy and support of youth and students around the world to the youth and students of Southeast Asia who were fighting heroically to break free from the shackles of imperialism, and assisting them in establishing or consolidating their organizations. In February 1948, the "Southeast Asia Youth and Student Conference" was held in India to help them exchange struggle experiences. Subsequently, in the summer of 1948, it joined the World Federation of Democratic Youth in organizing a delegation to visit colonial countries in the Middle East and North Africa. At the same time, it held the "Latin American Youth and Student Conference" and the "Latin American Student Leaders Conference" in Mexico. All of these activities have promoted the development of the student movements in Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, North Africa, and other of the world's largest colonial and semi-colonial regions, and the student movements in these regions are part of the world's entire peace and democracy struggle.

　　In addition, the "World Student Week" (November 10th-17th), "International Student Day" (November 17th), "Day of Struggle Against the Colonial System" (February 21st), "Day of Support for the Spanish Youth Struggle" (April 14th), etc., initiated by the International Union of Students, have become days for students around the world to expand propaganda and demonstrations. Activities on these days consolidate and expand the ranks of progressive students worldwide.

　　The International Union of Students is constantly committed to the welfare, relief, travel, sports, and other aspects of students around the world. For example, in promoting student welfare, it has donated books, stationery, medicines, etc., to students in colonial, semi-colonial, and other countries who are in urgent need. At the same time, it strongly supports the establishment of the International Student Relief Fund, which will establish regional headquarters in Asia, Western Europe, and Brazil to investigate the living needs of students in various regions, carry out relief movements, and establish student sanatoriums in various regions. The sanatorium in China was laid on February 21, 1951. In sports, the International Union of Students is the organizer of the University Summer and Winter Games. In culture and travel, the International Union of Students is working hard to strengthen its work. This spring, it organized a Czech student art troupe to visit the United Kingdom and organized an international student camp in Poland to strengthen friendship and unity among students from various countries. In addition, it regularly publishes "World Student News," "IUS Bulletin," and a series of books on the studies and struggles of students from various countries, which has played a role in promoting the exchange of experiences in student movements in various countries.

　　The International Union of Students has continued to develop in the course of its struggle. When it was founded, it had only 38 countries and 1.5 million members, and now it has grown to 71 countries and 5 million members. The International Union of Students is a strong representative organization of all democratic students around the world.

　　In August 1950, the International Union of Students held its Second World Student Congress in Prague. The Congress put forward the primary task for students in all countries to actively strive for world peace and stop imperialist aggression. The Congress summarized the struggle experience of the International Union of Students in the four years since its establishment and made resolutions for the development of future work. This Congress demonstrated the great unity of students around the world in the struggle for peace and was an important milestone in the progress of the international democratic student movement.

　　The International Union of Students has always supported the just struggle of Chinese students. It has repeatedly launched students from all countries to support the struggle of our students against American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek. For example, in the "May 20th," "June 9th," "July 5th," and "August 15th" movements, the International Union of Students and student unions of many countries have sent telegrams to our students to express their condolences and strongly condemn the Kuomintang reactionaries for persecuting students. In the summer of 1948, IUS representative Briman visited China, successively arriving in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and other places, giving great encouragement to our students who were fighting heroically in coordination with the people of the whole country against the Kuomintang reactionaries. In 1949, when the People's Republic of China was proclaimed, the representative of the International Union of Students telegraphed the All-China Students' Federation on behalf of democratic students around the world, expressing congratulations and cheering for the bright future of Chinese students!

　　This time, the International Union of Students is holding its Executive Committee in China, which shows that the International Union of Students fully understands the role played by the Chinese student movement and reflects the enthusiastic support of Chinese students for the International Union of Students.

　　国际学生联合会介绍
    一九四六年八月，世界学生第一次代表大会在捷克首都布拉格召开，正式成立了国际学生联合会。五年来，国际学联根据会章规定的方针，一直团结着世界学生反对帝国主义，争取持久和平、民族独立、民主教育而斗争，对于世界和平民主阵营的巩固和扩大，贡献了自己的力量。
    国际学联一贯地坚决拥护全世界的和平事业。它不断地号召世界学生为和平而斗争，制止帝国主义的侵略。当美帝国主义在朝鲜发动疯狂的侵略战争时，国际学联便呼吁各国学生支援朝鲜青年学生，要求和平解决朝鲜问题。国际学联积极参加全世界的和平运动，它曾派遣代表出席了历届的世界和平大会，并成为该会重要会员之一。去年世界和大常设委员会发起斯德哥尔摩宣言的和平签名运动以后，国际学联曾动员各国学生热烈响应，并以和平旗帜奖给优异的签名搜集者。当今年二月第一届世界和平理事会会议作了“缔结五大国和平公约”、“反对武装西德、日本”等十项决议时，国际学联立即号召世界学生为其实现而斗争。国际学联长时期以来就坚决地反对学校、教育与研究工作的军国主义化，反对帝国主义的战争宣传。
    在一九四九的八月，国际学联曾与世界民主青年联盟共同组织了在布达佩斯举行的第二届世界青年与学生联欢节；今年又要和世界青联共同组织八月五日至十九日在柏林举行的第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节，号召一切正直的青年和学生热烈参加这一盛大的和平大示威，共同为争取持久和平而奋斗。
    国际学联把支援殖民地附属国学生争取民族解放的斗争，作为它的重要任务之一。一九四七年初，国际学联和世界青联组织了“东南亚访问团”，把世界青年和学生的同情与支援带给了正在为挣脱帝国主义枷锁而英勇斗争的东南亚青年和学生，协助他们成立或巩固了他们的组织；一九四八年二月，在印度召开了“东南亚青年和学生大会”，协助他们交流斗争经验；此后，又在一九四八年夏，和世界青联共同组织代表团，访问了中东和北非各殖民地国家，同时，并在墨西哥召开了“拉丁美洲青年和学生大会”及“拉丁美洲学生领袖会议”。所有这些活动都促进了东南亚、拉丁美洲、中东、北非等这几个世界上最大的殖民地、半殖民地区域学生运动的发展，而这些地区的学生运动是世界整个和平民主斗争的一部分。
    此外，国际学联所发起的“世界学生周”（十一月十日——十七日），“国际学生日”（十一月十七日），“反对殖民制度斗争日”（二月二十一日），“支援西班牙青年斗争日”（四月十四日）等，都成为世界学生扩大宣传和示威的日子。在这些日子的活动都巩固和扩大着世界进步学生的队伍。
    国际学联不断地致力于世界学生的福利、救济、旅行、体育等项工作。如在促进学生生活福利方面，曾以书籍、文具、医药等赠送给殖民地、半殖民地等国需要迫切的学生。同时并大力赞助国际学生救济会的成立，该会将在亚洲、西欧及巴西分别设立区域总部，调查各地区学生的生活需要情况，开展救济运动并建立各地区的学生疗养院。在中国的疗养院已于一九五一年二月二十一日奠基。在体育方面，国际学联是大学生夏令及冬令运动会的组织者。在文化、旅行等方面，国际学联正努力加强工作，今年春天曾组织了捷克的学生文工团访问英国，并在波兰组织国际学生营加强各国学生之间的友谊和团结。此外经常出版《世界学生新闻》，《国际学联公报》及各国学生的学习和斗争的丛书，对各国学运经验的交流，起了推动作用。
    国际学联在斗争过程中不断地发展，在成立时只有三十八个国家，一百五十万会员，现在已发展到七十一个国家，五百万会员。国际学联是全世界一切民主学生的强有力的代表组织。
    一九五○年八月，国际学联在布拉格召开了世界学生第二次代表大会，大会提出了各国学生当前的首要任务为积极地争取世界和平，制止帝国主义的侵略。大会总结了国际学联自成立以来的四年间的斗争经验，并为未来工作的展开而作了决议。这次代表大会表现了世界学生在争取和平斗争中的伟大团结，在国际民主学生运动向前发展的进程中是一块重要的里程碑。
    国际学联一向支援中国学生的正义斗争，它曾经屡次发动各国学生支援我国学生为反对美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石所进行的斗争。例如在“五、二○”“六、九”“七、五”“八、一五”等历次运动中，国际学联及许多国家的学联都曾致电我国同学，表示慰问，并对国民党反动派迫害学生的暴行加以严厉的谴责。一九四八年夏，国际学联代表布丽曼曾来中国访问，先后到达北京、上海、杭州、南京等地，对正在配合全国人民力量和国民党反动派进行英勇斗争的我国学生，给予极大的鼓舞。一九四九年，当中华人民共和国宣告成立时，国际学联代表全世界的民主学生致电我国全国学联，表示祝贺并为中国学生的未来光辉前途而欢呼！
    这次国际学联，在中国召开执行委员会，表现了国际学联充分了解中国学生运动所起的作用，并反映了中国学生对国际学联的热烈拥护。
