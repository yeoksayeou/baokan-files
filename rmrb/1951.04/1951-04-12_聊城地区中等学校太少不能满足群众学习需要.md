To the Editor:

　　The children of peasants who have stood up are eager to learn. In some small and medium-sized cities, the number of secondary schools is too small, and it is becoming apparent that they cannot meet the needs of the masses.

　　This winter, the Liaocheng United Normal School in Pingyuan Province recruited 150 new students (100 males and 50 females). Within a few days, the number of applicants reached more than 2,700 (2,500 males and 200 females). They came from rural areas in more than a dozen counties near Liaocheng, braving the severe cold and carrying bedding, dry food, etc., walking hundreds of miles to take the entrance examination. However, due to the limited number of places available, more than 90% of the applicants could not be admitted. Therefore, I think the government should establish more secondary schools in rural areas and small cities to meet the learning requirements of the vast number of peasant children.

　　聊城地区中等学校太少不能满足群众学习需要编辑同志：
    翻身后的农民子弟迫切要求学习，在某些中小城市，中等学校太少，已显得不能满足群众的需要。
    平原省聊城联合师范学校，今冬招考新生一百五十名（男生一百名，女生五十名），在数天内，报名者已达二千七百余人（男二千五百人，女二百人）。他们来自聊城附近十几县的农村，冒着严寒，携带被褥、干粮等，从几百里外徒步跑来投考。但因招收的名额太少，百分之九十以上的人均不能被录取。因此，我觉得政府应在农村和小城市中多建立一些中等学校，以满足广大农民子弟们的学习要求。
