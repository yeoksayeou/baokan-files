Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: Qiao Mingxun, the Chairman of the Tianjin Rubber Trade Association and Deputy Manager of the private Zhenzhong Rubber Factory, was arrested in Tianjin for swindling a large sum of national property while contracted to manufacture military raincoats for the Logistics Department of a certain military region. Taking advantage of his position as Chairman of the Rubber Trade Association and as the representative of the contracted factory, Qiao used fraudulent and monopolistic means to inflate the cost of raincoats and illegally speculate by misappropriating funds, resulting in delays in military supplies. After a detailed investigation, the Tianjin Municipal People's Procuratorate filed a public prosecution with the Tianjin Municipal People's Court on April 14th. The Tianjin Municipal People's Court accepted the prosecution and arrested Qiao on the 16th.

On November 27th of last year, Qiao Mingxun, as a member of the Tianjin Rubber Trade Association and representative of the contracted factory, signed a contract with the Logistics Department of a certain military region to manufacture military raincoats. During the signing of the contract, both parties agreed, and it was explicitly stated in the contract that the profit margin would be 5%. However, Qiao fraudulently inflated the cost of each raincoat (including the cloth, rubber, and gasoline supplied by the military, as well as all factory expenses and profits) from around 100,000 yuan to 141,000 yuan, thus illegally obtaining profits exceeding 20%. According to the actual cost calculation of Qingdao Qilu Rubber Factory on February 12th of this year, each raincoat only cost 112,061 yuan (this calculation is still relatively high). Using this figure, the cost of each raincoat was inflated by nearly 30,000 yuan. Therefore, the hundreds of thousands of raincoats contracted by Qiao resulted in a loss of billions of yuan in national property.

The main facts of Qiao's fraudulent acquisition of national property through inflated costs are as follows: The original contract stipulated that the dyeing fee for each bolt of cloth was 45,000 yuan, but according to a reliable investigation, the actual cost was 32,500 yuan. Moreover, after dyeing, each bolt of cloth could be stretched by about 1.5 to 2 yards, but Qiao concealed this fact and cut off the excess before sending it to the dyeing factory. In addition to the stretched amount, each bolt of cloth could also be used to make ten raincoats, while the original contract only stipulated nine and a half. The most shocking aspect was the amount of gasoline defrauded by Qiao. The original contract stipulated that each bolt of cloth required 4.5 gallons of gasoline for coating (later changed to 4.3 gallons), but technicians at the Xingguang Rubber Factory, one of the factories that used more gasoline for manual coating, stated that their factory only used 3.06 gallons of gasoline per bolt of cloth. Qilu Company, which used three-roller machines for coating, used less than one gallon per bolt of cloth. Eleven-twelfths of the raincoats ordered this time were manufactured by rubber factories with three-roller machines. The original contract stipulated that the sewing fee was 8,038 yuan per raincoat, but the actual cost was only 4,927 yuan. In addition, Qiao inflated the cost of various materials to obtain exorbitant profits.

According to the contract, Qiao Mingxun - the representative of the contracted factory - was responsible for delivering the goods on time. However, no goods were delivered after the first deadline, and less than half of the required amount was delivered after the second deadline. The main reason for the delay in delivery was that Qiao had withheld payments, deposited them in the bank to generate interest for personal gain, and misappropriated some of the funds for speculative trading, which hindered the production of the contracted factories. Qiao also replaced the military's supplied Wufu and Shuanglong cloth with inferior materials, and for nearly a month, he reduced the amount of rubber used by 140 jin per day, resulting in very poor quality raincoats. Of the raincoats delivered by March 31st, more than one-quarter were defective.

Qiao also unreasonably withheld payments from the contracted factories. Xingguang Rubber Factory, which contracted to produce 25,000 raincoats, had more than 20 million yuan withheld. Tianjin Rubber Factory had a total of 94.35 million yuan withheld in several instances. Qiao also stole and sold the packaging, iron strips, and bamboo boards from the military-allocated raincoat cloth, worth a total of 38 million yuan, and distributed it to more than ten employees of the Rubber Trade Association.

This incident caused significant losses to national property, and Qiao should obviously bear the main responsibility. However, the witnesses to the signing of the contract, the Central Ministry of Light Industry (represented by Ai Zhicheng), the supervisors from the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau, and the procurers from the Logistics Department of a certain military region (represented by Qu Jianguo), lacked in-depth investigation and research beforehand, giving bad elements an opportunity to exploit the situation, which was one of the reasons for the loss of national property. The draft "Specifications for Ordering Military Shoes and Raincloth" stipulated by the Central Ministry of Light Industry at the National Rubber Industry Conference set the gasoline consumption too high, which also created favorable conditions for Qiao to defraud national property.

　　天津市逮捕诈取国家巨款的奸商乔铭勋
    该犯承做军用雨衣提高成本扣留贷款非法投机贻误军需
    【新华社十八日讯】天津市橡胶同业公会主任委员、私营震中橡胶厂副经理乔铭勋，在承制某军区后勤部军需部军用雨衣中，利用其橡胶同业公会主任委员的地位和承订厂代表人的身份，用欺诈垄断手段，抬高雨衣成本，骗取国家大量财产；又挪用货款，偷换材料，致不能按合同规定的期限和规格交货，贻误军需。天津市人民检察署经过详细侦查，已于四月十四日向该市人民法院提起公诉。天津市人民法院已接受这一公诉，于十六日将乔犯逮捕。
    去年十一月二十七日乔铭勋以天津市橡胶同业公会会员、承订厂代表人身份，与某军区后勤部军需部订立承做军用雨衣合同。在签订合同时，双方商妥，并于合同中明文规定利润为百分之五。但乔犯却用欺诈手段，把雨衣成本（包括军方供给的布、胶、汽油，厂方一切费用和利润）由每件十万元左右抬高到十四万一千元，诈取非法利润达百分之二十以上。依据青岛齐鲁橡胶厂今年二月十二日的实际成本计算，每件雨衣只用十一万二千零六十一元（此计算尚偏高），如以此数计算，每件雨衣就抬高成本近三万元。因此，由乔犯代表承制的数十万套雨衣，就使国家财产损失达数十亿元。
    乔犯从抬高成本中骗取国家财产的主要事实如下：原订合同中规定每匹布染费为四万五千元，但据确切调查，实际是三万二千五百元。又如每匹布经过染色以后，可伸长一码五到两码左右，但乔犯却讳而不言，并在发给染厂前从中剪去。除伸长之数以外，每匹布也可以裁雨衣十件，而原合同中却规定裁九件半。最惊人的是乔犯骗取的汽油数量。原合同规定每匹布上胶用汽油四点五加仑（后改为四点三加仑），但用人工上胶耗费汽油较多的承制厂之一——星光橡胶厂的技师说，该厂每匹布也只用汽油三点零六加仑。用三联滚机上胶的齐鲁公司，每匹布还没有用到一加仑。而这次定制的雨衣，有十二分之十一是有三联滚机的橡胶厂承制的。原合同规定缝纫费每件是八千零三十八元，但实际只用四千九百二十七元。此外，乔犯并把各种材料费用都抬高，以骗取暴利。
    按照合同规定，乔铭勋——承制厂代表人——应负按期交货的责任。但第一次到期后一件未交，第二次到期后只交了不到应交数的一半。延误交货的主要原因是乔犯曾扣留货款存入银行生息肥己，并挪用一部作投机买卖，妨碍了各承制厂的生产。乔犯又用粗劣布匹盗换军方所供给的五福布和双龙布，并在将近一月的时间内，每天偷工减料少用的橡胶达一百四十斤，结果雨衣质量非常低劣。到三月三十一日为止交验的雨衣中，残品就占四分之一还多。
    乔犯又无理克扣承制厂的货款。星光橡胶厂承做两万五千件雨衣，就被他扣除二千多万元。天津橡胶厂被扣几次，共九千四百三十五万余元。该犯并曾将军方拨给雨衣布的包皮、铁条、竹板等盗卖，共值三千八百万元，分给该同业公会十余职员。
    这次事件使国家财产遭受重大损失，其主要责任显然应由乔犯担负。但签订该项合同的鉴证人中央轻工业部（代表人艾志诚）、监督人天津市人民政府工商局和定货人某军区后勤部军需部（代表人曲建国）等事前缺乏深入调查研究，予坏分子以可乘之机，也是这次使国家财产遭受损失的原因之一。中央轻工业部在全国橡胶工业会议上规定的“军鞋雨布定货规格”草案中，把汽油用量定得太高，也为乔犯诈取国家财产造成有利条件。
