Xinhua News Agency dispatch: United Press International released the text of the draft of the Treaty of Peace with Japan, unilaterally formulated by the United States, on April 5th. The full text is as follows:

Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan (for advisory purposes only)

The Allied Powers and Japan, determining that their future relations shall be those of sovereign and equal nations, will co-operate in friendly association to promote their common welfare and to maintain international peace and security; Japan declares its intention to apply for membership in the United Nations and in all circumstances to conform to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations; to strive to realize the objectives of the United Nations Declaration regarding human rights; to create conditions of stability and well-being in its country, as provided for in Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter of the United Nations, which have been initiated by Japan's post-war legislation; and to observe fair practices prevailing internationally in trade and commerce, both national and private. The Allied Powers welcome these intentions of Japan and will endeavor to assist their realization. To provide a lasting and peaceful foundation for their future relationships, the Allied Powers and Japan have concluded this Treaty.

Chapter I Peace

I. The state of war between the Allied Powers and Japan has terminated.

Chapter II Sovereignty

II. The Allied Powers recognize the full sovereignty of the Japanese people over Japan and its territorial waters.

Chapter III Territory

III. Japan renounces all right, title and claim to Korea, Taiwan and the Pescadores Islands; and renounces all right, title and claim derived from or associated with the mandate system or arising from the activities of nationals of Japan in the Antarctic area. Japan accepts the action of the United Nations Security Council of April 2, 1947, extending the trusteeship system to the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific.

IV. The United States may propose to the United Nations that the Ryukyu Islands south of 29 degrees North Latitude, the Bonin Islands, including Rosario Island (i.e. Nishino-shima), the Volcano Islands (i.e. Iwo Jima - translator's note), Parece Vela (i.e. Okinotorishima - translator's note) and Marcus Island (i.e. Minami-Tori-shima - translator's note) be placed under the trusteeship system with the United States as the administering authority. Japan will concur in any such proposals. Pending the making of such proposals and affirmative action thereon, the United States will have the right to exercise all and any administrative, legislative and judicial powers over the territory and inhabitants of these islands, including their territorial waters.

V. Japan will return the southern part of Sakhalin and all islands adjacent to it to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and cede the Kurile Islands to the Soviet Union.

Chapter IV Security

VI. Japan undertakes the obligations set forth in Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations, and especially the following:
　　A. To settle its international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace, security and justice are not endangered;
　　B. To refrain in its international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations;
　　C. To give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the Charter, and to refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the United Nations may take preventive or enforcement action.
The Allied Powers shall, in their relations with Japan, comply mutually with the principles of Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations.

VII. The Allied powers recognize that as a sovereign nation Japan has the inherent right of self-defense as contemplated by the Charter of the United Nations, and that Japan may voluntarily enter into collective security arrangements or one or more agreements in which one or more of the Allied powers participate. Such agreements shall be solely for security against armed attack.
　　Note: The above proposals, in themselves, are not considered to be exhaustive in security matters and shall be supplemented by the results of the current exchange of views. The purpose of the current exchange of views is to maintain the security of the Pacific and to enable Japan to contribute to the safeguarding of its own security thereafter, while ensuring that Japan does not adopt armaments that could become a threat of aggression or be used to promote peace and security otherwise than in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations.

Chapter V Political and Economic Clauses

VIII. Japan will continue to be a party to existing multilateral treaties and agreements designed to promote legitimate commerce, prohibit the abuse of narcotics, and protect fisheries and marine mammals, and Japan will endeavor to accede to those to which it is not yet a party.

IX. Japan agrees to enter into negotiations expeditiously with any nation that so desires for the conclusion of new bilateral and multilateral agreements for the regulation, conservation and development of fisheries on the high seas.

X. Each of the Allied Powers shall, within one year after this Treaty has come into force between it and Japan, notify Japan which of its pre-war bilateral treaties with Japan it wishes to continue in effect or to revise, and any such treaty shall continue in effect or shall be revised accordingly. The treaties so continued or revised shall be only those which are not inconsistent with this Treaty, and the treaty provisions thereby superseded shall be deemed terminated. All treaties not so notified shall be deemed terminated.

XI. Japan renounces all special rights and interests in China.

XII. The power to grant clemency, reduce sentences, parole and pardon to war criminals imprisoned in Japan pursuant to judgments of Allied Military Tribunals may not be exercised except on recommendation of the government or governments of one or more of the countries on whose territory the accused committed the offenses. In the case of those sentenced by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, such power may not be exercised except on the recommendation of the majority of the governments of those countries which participated in that Tribunal.

XIII. Japan declares that it will readily conclude treaties or agreements with each of the Allied Powers to place their commercial and trade relations on a stable and friendly basis. Pending the conclusion thereof, the Government of Japan will, during a period of three years from the date this Treaty comes into force, grant the Allied Powers most-favored-nation treatment with respect to customs duties, taxes and all other regulations applying to the importation and exportation of goods and other regulations relating thereto. Simultaneously, the Government of Japan shall accord to the vessels, nationals, companies and property, interests and commercial activities of the Allied Powers in Japan national treatment, or most-favored-nation treatment, whichever is the more advantageous. National treatment shall not include coastwise and domestic navigation. If any country requires Japan to grant it advantages concerning any of the above matters which are higher than those granted by it to Japan, other than those exceptions normally reserved by commercial treaties, Japan may refuse to grant such advantages.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the first paragraph of this Article, the Government of Japan shall be entitled to take measures to safeguard its external financial position, balance of payments or vital interests, and to reserve exceptions normally included in commercial agreements.

Pending the conclusion of civil aviation transport agreements, Japan shall, during a period of three years, grant to the Allied Powers no less favorable treatment with respect to civil air traffic than that previously enjoyed by the Allied Powers in respect of civil air traffic prior to the coming into force of this Treaty.

The Japanese submarine cables connecting Japan with territory over which Japan ceases to exercise control pursuant to this Treaty shall be equally divided. Japan will retain the Japanese terminal and half of the adjoining cable. The remainder, together with the adjoining installations, shall belong to the separating territory.

Chapter VI Claims and Property

XIV. The Allied Powers recognize that Japan lacks the capacity to pay adequate reparations to the Allied Powers for damage caused by it during the war and to meet its other obligations, by means of the transfer of gold, money, property or services, enabling Japan to maintain a viable economy. However, Japan shall accord to each of the Allied Powers the right to seize, retain and dispose of all property, rights and interests of Japan and Japanese nationals which on September 2, 1945, were within the territories relinquished by Japan, or were within the territory of any of the Allied Powers administered under the United Nations trusteeship system, except for:
　　(1) Property of Japanese nationals permitted to reside within the territory of an Allied Power and not subjected to special measures applied prior to September 2, 1945;
　　(2) Material assets of diplomatic and consular missions, less storage charges;
　　(3) Property of non-political and religious, charitable, cultural or educational institutions;
　　(4) Property within Japan, wherever documents of title or other evidence of ownership or of claims to such property may be located;
　　(5) Trade marks identifying Japanese products.
If any of the Allied Powers has derived Japanese or Japanese national industrial property rights or interests from the territory of another Allied Power, it shall conduct settlement with the other Allied Power.

Claims of the Allied Powers for reparations and for direct military costs of occupation shall be deemed to be satisfied from Japanese assets (subject to the aforementioned legal relationships) and from resources acquired from the Japanese mainland during the occupation. (Note: The above proposal on compensation shall be determined in accordance with the exchange of opinions that are currently being conducted.)

XV. Upon demand made within six months after the coming into force of this Treaty, Japan will return the property, tangible and intangible, and rights or interests of any of the Allied Powers or its nationals which are within Japan, provided that the possessor did not voluntarily dispose of it through compulsion or deceit. If the property of an Allied Power or its nationals in Japan was damaged or destroyed as a result of the war, compensation shall be made in Japanese yen at the exchange rate between yen and foreign currency pursuant to Japanese domestic law.

XVI. Japan waives all claims of Japan and its nationals arising out of any actions taken by the Allied Powers during the period of the war (which is terminated by this Treaty), and waives all claims arising from the presence, operations or actions of any Allied authorities or forces in Japanese territory prior to the coming into force of this Treaty.

Chapter VII Settlement of Disputes

XVII. Any dispute between any of the Allied Powers and Japan arising out of the interpretation or execution of this Treaty, which is not settled by diplomatic means, shall be referred, at the request of either party to the dispute, to the International Court of Justice.

Japan and those of the Allied Powers which are not parties to the Statute of the International Court of Justice will deposit with the International Court of Justice, at the time of their ratification of this Treaty, a joint declaration, in accordance with the resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations of October 15, 1946, accepting the jurisdiction of the Court in respect of all disputes of the character described in this Article and undertaking to comply with the decisions of the Court.

Chapter VIII Final Clauses

XVIII. For the purposes of this Treaty, the Allied Powers shall be deemed to be those states which have been at war with Japan or have been in a state of war with Japan, and which are parties to this Treaty.

XIX. Except as otherwise provided in Article XI, this Treaty shall not confer any rights, titles or benefits on any state which is not a signatory, ratifier or acceding state. Nor shall any provision of this Treaty be deemed to diminish or prejudice the rights, title and interests of Japan in favor of any state not a signatory, ratifier or acceding state (subject to the above exception - translator's note: referring to the provisions of Article XI).

XX. Japan shall not enter into any treaty or military reparations agreement with any state which gives to that state preferences exceeding those given to signatory states of this Treaty.

XXI. This Treaty shall be ratified by the Allied Powers and by Japan. It shall come into force as between Japan and each of the other ratifying states when the instruments of ratification have been deposited by Japan and by a majority of the states which are members of the Far Eastern Commission, including the principal occupying power, the United States, with the Government of the United States. If the Treaty has not come into force within nine months after Japan's ratification, any Allied Power may, at its discretion, give notice to the Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of its intention that this Treaty shall come into force between that state and Japan.

The Government of the United States will inform all signatory and acceding states of all instruments of ratification and notices deposited with it pursuant to this Treaty.

XXII. Any state which has been at war with Japan or in a state of war with Japan, and which is not a party to this Treaty, may accede to this Treaty at any time within three years after the Treaty has come into force between Japan and any state which has ratified this Treaty.

Accession shall be effected by depositing an instrument of accession with the Government of the United States, which will notify all signatory and acceding states of each such declaration.

    七、盟国承认为主权国家的日本具有联合国宪章所规定的单独或集体的，自然应有的自卫权，并承认日本可以自愿地参加集体安全的一个或几个协定，其中有一个或数个盟国参加者。此等协定将专为反对武装进攻而保障安全者。
    注：上述建议本身在安全方面并不能视为是详尽的，须视目前交换意见之结果，再加以补充。目前交换意见的用意在于维持太平洋的安全，并使日本此后能为保障其本身安全有所贡献而使日本为此目的不采取可以成为进攻的威胁，或可以作为非按照联合国宗旨与原则促进和平与安全之用的武装。
  第五章  政治及经济方面的条款
    八、对于现有促进正当商务，禁止滥用麻醉剂，保护鱼类与海兽类的各项多边条约与协定，日本将继续为缔约国之一方，对于尚未加入者，日本将设法加入之。
    九、日本同意和愿意的各国迅速开始谈判以便缔订关于管理、保护与发展公海渔业之新的双边及多边协定。
    十、盟国之每一国家于本条约在该国与日本之间生效后一年期内，将通知日本其在战前对日所订的双边条约之中对何者愿意保存有效或加以修订，则此种条约将继续有效或将加以修订。但此等条约中不适合于本条约的条款不在此例。此种条款均应认为废止。凡未经依照上述方法通知之一切条约，均将认为废止。

    十三、日本声明它准备与各盟国迅速缔结条约或协定，以便将相互间之商业与贸易关系建立在稳固与友好的基础上。在这个期间，日本政府在本条约一经生效后三年内，在关税、捐税及其他适用于进出口货及和进出口货有关的一切其他规章方面，均给予各盟国以最惠国的待遇。日本政府同时对盟国船只、国民、公司以及他们在日本的财产、利益及商业活动方面给予国民待遇，或最惠国待遇，视何者较为有利而决定之。国民待遇不包括日本的沿岸及国内航行。关于上述任何事项如任何一国要求日本给予优待，比较该国除其商约照例保留者外，所给予日本之优待为较高者，则日本得以拒绝之。

  第六章  要求及财产
    十四、盟国认为，日本无力以那些可以使日本维持生存经济的黄金，钱款，财产或劳役当支付手段，以履行其对于自一九四五年九月二日起为进行占领目的所给与的救济与经济协助之义务，并对盟国因战争而引起之损失给以相当的赔偿。但对于在一九四一年十二月七日至一九四五年九月二日期间处于日本所放弃的领土之内，或处于盟国中任何一盟国依照联合国托管制度所管理的领土之内一切日本的及日本国民的财产、权利与利益，日本给予每一盟国以支配保留及处理之权，但下列各项除外：
    （１）原来被允许居于某一盟国境内，并未成为在一九四五年九月二日以前所实施的特殊措施的对象之日本国民的财产；
    （２）扣除保管费用以后的外交及领事机关的物质资产；
    （３）非政治性的，以及宗教、慈善、文化或教育等机关的财产；

    盟国之赔偿要求及因占领的直接军事开支而提出的要求，将认为应由日本资产（但须考虑上述各项法权关系）并由占领期内自日本本土所已取得的资财赔偿之。（附注：上述关于赔偿的建议须视正在交换的意见如何而确定之。）
    十五、凡每一盟国或其国民在日本所有的物资财产或非物资财产及各种权利或利益，日本于本条约生效后六个月内，一经提出要求，即应归还各该盟国及其国民，但持有人并非因强迫或受骗，业经自愿加以处理者，不在此列。若盟国或盟国国民在日本之财产因战争而受亏损，则应根据日本国内法，按照日元与外币兑换之比率，以日元赔偿之。
    十六、日本放弃其国家与国民因各盟国在战争期内（此战争系由本条约所结束者）所采取行动而发生之一切要求，并放弃在本约生效以前因任何盟国当局或军队在日本领土上的驻在、策动或行动而发生的要求。
  第七章  争端之调解
    十七、由于本条约之解释或履行，任何一盟国与日本之间所发生之争端，未经外交途径解决者，应根据争端任何一方之要求，提交国际法庭解决之。
    日本及未参加国际法庭机构之盟国，应于批准本约时并按照一九四六年十月十五日联合国安全理事会之决议，向国际法庭交存共同声明，表示接受该法庭对于具有本条所述性质的一切争端之管辖，无须专缔协定。
  第八章  最后条款
    十八、为本条约之目的，所称盟国系指曾与日本作战或曾与日本处于战争状态，并为本条约缔约国之国家。
    十九、除第十一条所规定者外，对任何未经签字，批准或加入本条约之国家，本条约将不给予任何权利、法律基础或利益。同时，本条约任何的规定不得为有利于未经签订、批准或加入本条约的国家，而削弱或损害日本的权利、法律基础与利益。（但仍有上述例外——译者按：系指第十一条的规定）
    二十、日本不与任何国家订立和平协议或军事赔偿的协议——其所给予该国之优例超过本条约所给予参加国之优例者。
    二十一、本条约由盟国及日本批准之。自日本及为远东委员会会员国之大多数国家，包括主要占领国美国在内，将批准书交与美国政府保管时起，本条约在日本及其他已批准之各国间即告生效。若在日本批准后九个月内，本约尚未生效，则任何一盟国得依其自愿以照会日本与美国政府之方式，使本约在该国与日本之间发生效力。
    关于所有按照本条约送交美国保管的批准书及照会，美国政府将通知所有已签字及已加入本条约之各国。
    二十二、与日本作战或与日本处于作战状态，而尚未签订本条约的任何国家，得于本条约在日本与批准本条约之任何一国间生效后三年内，随时加入本条约。
    此等加入，以将加入声明书交与美国政府保管之方式进行之。美国政府将每一此等声明，通知所有已签字及已加入本条约之各国。
