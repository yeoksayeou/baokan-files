　　Nanjing Industrial and Mining Enterprises Launch the Patriotic Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement: Experiences and Gains
　　Jin Yukun
　　In Nanjing, the patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea movement has become a key driving force for all production and work in industrial and mining enterprises. Simultaneously, through this movement, the most practical, vivid, and effective class education has been conducted, leading to an unprecedented increase in the political consciousness of workers and staff.

　　The Situation Before the Movement
　　Before the movement, due to the lack of in-depth and systematic class education, the general level of class consciousness among workers and staff was not very high. After the American troops landed at Inchon, not only were the masses of workers and staff emotionally shaken, but even some trade union cadres experienced extreme ideological confusion. For example, a trade union cadre for stevedores, who had been very active in the movement against feudal leaders, suddenly became dispirited with the change in the Korean war situation. A tricycle trade union cadre, influenced by rumors, even hesitated to stamp membership applications. Precisely because of this, counter-revolutionaries hidden in factories and enterprises became very arrogant, even openly attacking activists, saying, "See how ruthless the American troops are!" Reactionary slogans also appeared frequently, fully exposing the particularly complex political situation within Nanjing's industrial and mining enterprises. On the other hand, some workers and staff held purely economic viewpoints, and counter-revolutionaries exploited this to instigate and agitate, leading to a decline in the workers' and staff's enthusiasm for production. Last November and December, the work for one week at the radio factory took three weeks to complete; a fitter made only thirteen rivets in a day, while normally thirteen rivets would not take half an hour. Learning also became a formality, either grumbling behind closed doors or basking in the sun eating peanuts. Activists were also very frustrated, complaining that the leadership could not come up with a solution.
　　This situation greatly hindered the city's production and work.
　　Last November, the city launched the patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea movement for workers and staff. The movement began with the study of current affairs, enabling workers and staff to ideologically draw a line between themselves and the enemy. Then, the study of suppressing counter-revolutionaries was conducted, drawing a line between themselves and the enemy organizationally. Through the above two studies, the workers' and staff's patriotic enthusiasm soared. To combine patriotic enthusiasm with practical action, a patriotic production competition was launched. During this period, centered on opposing the American arming of Japan, the "February 7th" demonstration parade was held; female workers and workers' families participated in the "March 8th" demonstration parade. Currently, the signing of patriotic pledges is being widely promoted to advance the Ma Hengchang Group production competition movement. The development of the movement is expanding from major factories and mines to general factories and shops, from concentrated industrial workers to scattered stevedores and handicraft workers, and from progressive masses to backward masses.

　　Adopting the Method of Mass Accusations, with the Masses Educating Each Other
　　The main reason why this movement can be so in-depth and widespread is that the method of mass accusations was adopted in the study. Initially, some factory masses were lethargic and could not "muster hatred towards America." For example, at the Ammonia Plant, eight large reports were given at the beginning, but the study could not be carried out. However, once the masses were mobilized to make accusations, the content immediately became richer. This is because the workers and staff suffered deeply from the oppression of imperialism and the reactionaries. Therefore, mobilizing workers and staff to widely accuse the crimes of American imperialism, Japanese invaders, Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, secret agents, landlords, and local tyrants, and revealing these bloody facts, is the best education for everyone. Through accusations, not only was hatred towards the enemy aroused, but also the confused thinking among workers and staff was criticized. When the Jiangnan Company began its accusations, some workers and staff still believed that although the United States was bad, without American cars, they would not be able to eat. However, in the accusations, the workers understood that the economic aggression of American imperialism prevented China's industry from rising, and therefore they could not build cars themselves. Thus, they shifted from "worshiping America" to hating America. Stevedore Zhang Azu said: In the past, we were asleep, but now Chairman Mao has woken us up.
　　Many workers and staff traced the roots of their suffering during the accusations, criticizing "fatalistic" thinking. For example, Tao Qinggao, a miner from Ma'anshan, had two younger brothers sold off due to the landlord's debt-collection. However, he believed that "winter melons grow hair, eggplants grow thorns"—it was destined to be so. Through recollections, comparisons, and casual talks, he found that the root cause of his suffering was the feudal class and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, not some "horoscope." In this way, workers and staff moved from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, clarifying their class stance.
　　Furthermore, from tracing the roots of suffering to digging out the roots of suffering. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries is one of its concrete actions. When the movement delved into accusing the crimes of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and secret agents and local tyrants, the masses' emotions became even more激昂 and the content became even more profound and rich.

　　Patriotic Ideological Education is the Important Key to Carrying Out All Work
　　At the beginning, the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, due to insufficient understanding of this movement, opposed the movement to production competition, resulting in neither being done well. Similar biases occurred in various factories. For example, the Ammonia Plant Trade Union believed that the welfare issues must be resolved first to enhance the trade union's prestige and carry out the movement. The Radio Factory believed that the situation was special and that the production system and wage issues must be resolved first. Therefore, "movement" and "production" were contradictory, which led the movement astray.
　　However, the development of the movement provided a good explanation. In units where the movement was launched, the masses' awareness was raised, the atmosphere in the factory was renewed, production that was not going well improved, learning that could not be carried out was carried out, those who were not united were united, and trade union work became active. For example, the Radio Factory, Nanjing Oil Press Factory, and Jiangnan Automobile Company were all units where the movement was carried out relatively well, and therefore, great changes occurred rapidly in production. The Radio Factory went from a state of extreme depression in production enthusiasm to exceeding its tasks, and the production of transformers increased from three to seven per day. The workers said: When secret agents are eliminated, heart disease is removed, eyes are brightened, and there is energy for production. The Nanjing Oil Press Factory, which had previously collapsed in the production competition, saw new records in output after the suppression of counter-revolutionaries; the serious phenomenon of breakdowns at Jiangnan Automobile Company also began to disappear. Therefore, in these units, it was no longer a question of the masses' enthusiasm for production, but rather how to strengthen leadership to meet the demands of the masses. In these units, the masses' thinking was transformed, patriotic enthusiasm was high, cadres' confidence was enhanced, and all work was smoothly advanced. On the contrary, units where the movement was not carried out in depth encountered obstacles in production and work. For example, although the wage adjustment was carried out at the Electric Porcelain Factory, the masses' ideological awareness was not raised, so more and more problems arose. Reactionary slogans and rumors appeared openly, and the masses' enthusiasm for production was low. Two major accidents have occurred recently.

　　Thoroughly Changed the Face of Industrial and Mining Enterprises
　　This movement not only carried out patriotic ideological education but was also combined with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, centered on "drawing a clear line between ourselves and the enemy," so the movement was filled with rich content of struggle. The depth and breadth of the movement are mainly manifested in the ideological mobilization of the masses. In places where the movement was carried out, the vast majority of the masses were mobilized. Taking the Third Manufacturing Group of the Radio Factory as an example: The group had 31 members. Before the movement, backward elements outnumbered activists. After the movement, there were 22 activists, accounting for two-thirds of the group, nine middle elements, accounting for one-third of the group, and the backward elements were completely transformed. Seventeen new activists emerged. This statistic illustrates the achievements of the patriotic movement in mobilizing the masses. Technical personnel, who had rarely participated in political movements since liberation, also deeply criticized the past purely technical viewpoints and the erroneous idea of being "above class" in the study, and actively participated in the movement. Jiang Ruiyang, a veteran master worker in the cold working workshop of the Radio Factory, often complained in the past and was once targeted by secret agents for development. During this suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the vicious face of the secret agent who had wooed him was exposed. He reviewed that due to his pro-American and fear-of-American mentality, after liberation, because there were no American goods, he felt that everything was unsatisfactory and unpleasant, allowing secret agents to exploit him. After Jiang's thinking was straightened out, his production efficiency doubled.
　　Through the study of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the complacency among workers and staff was corrected, and the masses' political vigilance was enhanced. For example, the Radio Factory suffered extremely heavy production losses last year due to the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries, but the factory always sought reasons from a technical and institutional perspective, ignoring the major political reasons, so the problem was never solved. After the counter-revolutionaries were uncovered, the truth came to light. The engineers felt that if they did not pay attention to politics today, production could not be done well. The workers said: If one bad person is left, then everyone will suffer. Some workers and staff clarified that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is a long-term task, so all factories established worker pickets to assist public security departments in protecting the safety of enterprises. The improvement of the masses' political vigilance is an extremely valuable and important gain.
　　Because the internal purity of the working class has been achieved, the workers and staff are unprecedentedly united, and righteousness has greatly risen. The workers said: "The reactionaries and secret agents want us to be backward, we want to progress; the reactionaries and secret agents want us to be divided, we want to be united." Ma Fengwen and You Shundu, veteran workers at the Ammonia Plant who had been at odds for four years, shook hands again. Dai Jin, chief engineer of the Water Plant, had been beaten by backward workers incited by secret agent Wu Dousheng in the past, and had deep misunderstandings about the workers. After Wu Dousheng's face was revealed this time, he realized that he had been deceived by the secret agent. Both sides conducted reviews and promised to unite and do a good job in production. At the same time, due to the unity and progress of the workers and staff, a large number of activists emerged. For example, in the North Branch of the Telecommunications Bureau, out of 48 people, backward elements used to account for half, but after the movement, only three people had not yet transformed.
　　Feudal gangs have a deep historical foundation in industrial and mining enterprises. In Ma'anshan alone, there are more than ten types of gangs. Counter-revolutionaries often use this as their base of operations. For example, secret agent Li Linpu in Ma'anshan carried out activities through the Lǐ Religion; secret agent Wang Cuiqing of Jiangnan Automobile Company used the "Thirteen Taibao," "One Hundred and Eight Generals," and "Thirty-Six Friends" as its base. Through this movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the true face of these feudal organizations was revealed: these gang leaders were either feudal despots or Kuomintang secret agents. Many deceived workers in Ma'anshan said: Thank the Communist Party for saving us, otherwise we would have been sold to the secret agents and despots without even knowing it! Deceived workers at Jiangnan Company, Xiaguan Power Plant, and other places have declared their withdrawal from gang organizations. The ideological foundation of feudal gangs among the masses has been initially destroyed.
　　Although the workers' and staff's patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea movement has achieved great results, its development is still very uneven. A trade union cadre at the Jiangnan Cement Plant had not even heard the four words "anti-American and aid-Korea." The foundation of the patriotic movement for other scattered small factories and shop assistants is also weak. These situations all show that carrying out the anti-American and aid-Korea patriotic movement in depth remains a serious political task.

　　南京工矿企业开展抗美援朝爱国运动的经验及其收获
    金雨困
    南京市抗美援朝爱国主义的运动，在工矿企业中已成为推动一切生产与工作的关键。同时由于通过这一运动，进行了最实际、最生动、最有效的阶级教育，因此职工政治觉悟获得了空前的提高。
  运动开展前的情况
    在运动开展以前，由于很少曾深入地、系统地进行过阶级教育，因此一般职工阶级觉悟是不很高的。当侵朝美军在仁川登陆后，不仅职工群众情绪波动，连某些工会干部思想也极度混乱。如有一个搬运工会干部，本来在反封建头子运动中非常积极，但随着朝鲜战局的转变，他却顿时消沉下来了。三轮车工会有一个干部因受谣言影响，旁人要入会，他连盖章都不敢了。正因为这样，暗藏在工厂企业中的反革命分子却十分嚣张起来，甚至公开打击积极分子说：“你看美军倒底狠不狠？”反动标语亦时常出现，充分暴露了南京工矿企业内的政治情况特别复杂的特点。另一方面，由于有些职工本身存在着经济观点，反革命分子即利用此点进行挑拨鼓动，因此使职工生产情绪一度十分低落。去年十一、十二月间，无线电厂一个星期的工作，三个星期尚未完成；有个钳工一天只做了十三个铆钉，在平时十三个铆钉还用不了半个钟头。学习也流于形式，不是关起房门发牢骚，便是晒太阳吃吃花生米。积极分子也很苦闷，埋怨领导拿不出办法来。
    这种情况，使全市生产、工作受到很大的阻碍。
    去年十一月开展了全市职工的抗美援朝的爱国主义运动。运动首先从学习时事开始，使职工在思想上划分敌我界线。接着进行了镇压反革命的学习，从组织上划分敌我界线。通过以上两个学习，职工爱国热情蓬勃高涨。为使爱国热情与实际行动结合，遂展开了爱国主义生产竞赛。其间曾以反对美国武装日本为中心，举行了“二七”示威大游行；女工和工属参加了“三八”示威大游行。目前正在普遍订立爱国公约，以推动马恒昌小组生产竞赛运动。运动的发展，正在由主要的厂矿企业普及到一般的厂、店中去，由集中的产业工人普及到分散性的搬运、手工业工人中去，由进步的群众普及到落后的群众中去。
  采取群众控诉的方法，由群众教育群众
    此次运动之所以能如此深入广泛，主要由于在学习中采取了群众控诉的方法。开始时有些工厂群众情绪疲塌，“仇美仇不起来”，如铔厂开始时做了八个大报告，学习还是无法开展。但一经发动群众控诉，内容便立即丰富起来。这是因为工人兄弟直接遭受帝国主义和反动派迫害十分深重，因此发动职工广泛控诉美帝国主义、日寇、蒋介石匪帮、特务、地主、恶霸的罪行，把这些血淋淋的事实揭开来，是对大家最好的教育。通过控诉不仅激发了对敌人的仇恨，并进而批判了职工中的糊涂思想。江南公司开始控诉时，有些职工仍认为：美国虽坏，但没有美国的汽车我们就吃不成饭。但在控诉中，工人明白了美帝国主义的经济侵略使中国工业不能抬头，因此自己不能造汽车，遂由“崇美”思想转变为仇美。加油工张阿组说：过去我们睡着了，现在毛主席把我们喊醒了。
    许多工人在控诉时深追苦根，批判了“宿命”思想。如马鞍山掘工陶青高两个弟弟被地主逼债卖掉了，他却认为：“冬瓜长毛，茄子长刺”——命该如此。通过回忆、对比、漫谈，他找出了受苦的根源是封建阶级和国民党的反动统治，而不是什么“时辰八字”。这样，使职工从感性认识提高到理性认识，明确了阶级立场。
    再进一步从追苦根到挖苦根。镇压反革命即其具体行动之一。当运动深入到控诉国民党反动统治和特务、恶霸的罪行的时候，群众情绪尤为激昂，内容亦更为深刻、丰富。
  爱国主义思想教育是开展一切工作的重要关键
    南京市总工会在开始时，由于对这一运动认识不足，因而把运动与生产竞赛对立起来，结果使两者均未搞好。各工厂亦发生类似偏向。如錏厂工会认为首先要解决了福利问题才能提高工会威信开展运动。无线电厂则认为情况特殊，首先要解决生产制度与工资问题，因此“运动”与“生产”相矛盾，就使运动走了弯路。
    但运动的发展情况却作了很好的说明。凡是运动开展起来的单位，群众觉悟提高，厂内气象一新，生产搞不好的好了，学习搞不起来的搞起来了，不团结的也团结了，工会工作也活跃起来了。如无线电厂、南京榨油厂、江南汽车公司均为运动搞得较好的单位，因此在生产上均迅速发生极大变化。无线电厂由生产情绪极度低落一变而为超过任务，变压器由每天生产三个增加到七个。工人说：特务铲除了，心病除掉了，眼睛亮了，生产就有劲了。南京榨油厂过去生产竞赛搞垮了台，自镇压反革命后，产量出现了新纪录；江南汽车公司严重的抛锚现象也开始消灭了。因此在这些单位里已不是群众生产积极性的问题，而是如何加强领导工作以适应群众要求的问题。在这些单位里，群众思想获得改造，爱国热情高涨，干部信心提高，一切工作均得顺利推进。相反，运动没有深入开展的单位，生产、工作都遇到了障碍。如电瓷厂虽把工资调整了，但群众思想觉悟未提高，因此问题却越来越多，反革命标语谣言公然出现，群众生产情绪低落，已连续数月不能完成生产任务。最近又发生了两次重大事故。
  彻底改变了工矿企业的面貌
    此次运动不仅进行了爱国主义的思想教育，而且是与镇压反革命相结合，以“划清敌我界线”为中心，因此使运动更充满了丰富的斗争内容。运动的深度和广度主要表现在思想上发动了群众，凡是运动开展起来的地方，绝大部分群众都被发动起来。以无线电厂第三制造组为例：该组共有三十一人，运动前，落后分子超过积极分子，运动开展后积极分子为二十二人，占全组三分之二，中间分子九人，占全组三分之一，落后分子完全转变，新涌现了积极分子十七人。这个统计数字说明了爱国运动发动群众的成绩。解放后从来很少参加政治运动的技术人员，在学习中亦深刻地批判了过去单纯技术观点与“超阶级”的错误思想，因而积极投入到运动中来。无线电厂冷作间有位老师傅江瑞阳，过去时常发牢骚，曾为特务作了发展的对象。此次镇压反革命中暴露了那位拉拢过他的特务凶恶面目，他检讨自己由于有崇美、恐美思想，解放后，因为没有美国货来了，什么也感到不如意、不顺眼，为特务钻了孔子。江老师傅思想搞通后，生产效率提高了一倍。
    通过镇压反革命的学习，纠正了职工中的麻痹思想，提高了群众的政治警惕性。如无线电厂去年由于反革命分子的破坏，生产损失极重大，而该厂始终仅从技术和制度上找寻原因，却忽视了重大的政治原因，因此问题始终得不到解决。自反革命分子破获后，真相就大白了。工程师们感觉今天再不问政治，生产就无法搞好。工人说：如果再留一个坏人，那么人人都要受害。一些职工们明确了镇压反革命是个长期性的工作，因此各厂均建立了工人纠察队协助公安部门保卫企业的安全。群众政治警惕性的提高是个极其可贵而重要的收获。
    由于纯洁了工人阶级的内部，职工空前团结，正气大大抬头。工人们说：“反动派、特务分子要我们落后，我们要进步；反动派、特务分子要我们分裂，我们要团结。”闹了四年意见的铔厂老工人马凤文和尤顺度又重携起手来。水厂总工程师戴进过去曾因特务分子武窦生煽动落后工人打过他，对工人误会很深，这次揭露武窦生面目后，知道原来是受了特务的欺骗，双方都进行了检讨，并保证团结，搞好生产。同时由于职工的团结进步，涌现了大批积极分子，如电信局北分局四十八个人中，过去落后分子要占半数，运动开展后，仅三人尚未转变。
    封建帮会在工矿企业中有着深厚的历史基础。仅马鞍山一处即有帮会十余种之多。反革命分子往往即以此为其活动的基地。如马鞍山特务李林普即是通过理教会进行活动；江南汽车公司特务王萃卿即利用“十三太保”、“一百零八将”、“三十六友”为其大本营。通过此次镇压反革命运动，揭露了这些封建组织的真面目：这些帮会头子不是封建恶霸，便是国民党特务。马鞍山许多被骗的工人说：感谢共产党救了我们，不然为特务、恶霸卖了命还不知道呢！江南公司、下关发电厂等被骗的工人，均纷纷声明脱离帮会组织。初步摧垮了封建帮会在群众中的思想基础。
    目前职工抗美援朝爱国运动虽已获得很大成绩，但其发展还是很不平衡的。江南水泥厂有一个工会干部甚至连“抗美援朝”四个字都没有听到过。其它分散小厂及店员爱国运动的基础均较薄弱。这些情况都说明深入开展抗美援朝爱国运动仍然是一个严重的政治任务。
