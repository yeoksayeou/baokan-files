　　Bulgaria Uncovers American Espionage Organization
　  Ringleaders Golkov and Others Sentenced to Death
    [Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 7th] According to TASS, Sofia, 6th: Bulgaria has uncovered a latent espionage organization directed by American and Greek intelligence agencies. Following a public trial, the principal culprits, Golkov and others, have been sentenced to death and imprisonment, respectively. The trial confirmed that the leaders of this organization fled Bulgaria for Greece in 1948, where they worked for American, British, and Greek intelligence agencies. According to instructions from the American Embassy and with the assistance of the Greek authorities, the spy Golkov established a terrorist organization in Athens. In the second half of 1949, the first batch of spies, carrying American money, weapons, and reactionary propaganda materials, infiltrated Bulgaria to recruit internal agents and carry out large-scale subversive and sabotage activities. The Sofia District Court concluded the trial of this case on the 6th, and the criminals have confessed to their crimes. The court sentenced Golkov and Dannev to death, and Pukov and others to varying terms of imprisonment.
