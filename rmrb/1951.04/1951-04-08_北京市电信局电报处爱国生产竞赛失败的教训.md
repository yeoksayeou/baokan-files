Lessons from the Failure of the Patriotic Production Competition

Zhu Bo

The Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Telegraph Office neglected to conduct ideological and political education for its employees, causing the failure of the patriotic production competition movement. This is a lesson that should be learned by other localities. The office has more than 600 employees, divided into over 50 production groups, but only 30 groups participated in the competition. Shortly after the competition began, some groups collapsed. According to statistics from January of this year, over 60 percent of the 30 production groups participating in the competition had collapsed. By February, the patriotic production competition movement had almost completely stopped. Workers' thinking was quite confused, and production morale was unstable. Many employees still had pro-American and admiring-America thoughts, believing that the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign should be abandoned halfway. A few backward workers even listened to the "Voice of America" and spread negative influences among the employees. As a result, not only did the patriotic production competition movement fail to get going, but even routine production work was affected. For example, several workers once went out during working hours to try to transfer to East China. This phenomenon of skipping work caused great losses. Other phenomena, such as workers sleeping and chatting idly during working hours, were quite common.

Why did the patriotic production competition movement at the Telegraph Office fail? One of the main reasons is that the leading cadres were satisfied with the superficial achievements of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and neglected the political foundation for launching the patriotic production competition movement: solving workers' ideological problems and raising workers' political consciousness. When the nationwide Resist America, Aid Korea movement began last year, the office's employees enthusiastically joined the movement. At that time, the workers' morale was very high. They purchased more than 300 copies of current affairs manuals at once, and wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, slogans, and pictures were all put up. On the surface, the office's Resist America, Aid Korea movement had already started, and because the office's employees were relatively well-educated, many workers could talk about the grand principles of resisting America and aiding Korea. Therefore, the leading cadres were satisfied with these superficial achievements, thinking that their Resist America, Aid Korea work had been done "almost enough." Consequently, they did not seek to solve the most important ideological problem for the workers: the problem of understanding American imperialism. The symposiums held and the current affairs reports made during the Resist America, Aid Korea movement were not targeted at the masses' ideological problems. Later, although the workers exposed some ideological problems in the symposiums, the leading cadres did not try to help solve them. In this situation, the leading cadres thought it was "time to move into practical action," so they hastily formulated a production competition plan and convened a mobilization meeting for the production competition movement. The competition conditions for the participating production groups were not well-considered or discussed by the workers before the so-called competition was formally launched.

Another reason why the office's production competition movement failed to be successful was the failure to regularly conduct current affairs and political education for the workers. Especially after the patriotic production competition movement began, the current affairs education for the workers was even more neglected. Although the leading cadres sometimes made current affairs reports, the number of attendees was less than one-third of all employees. The slogans and pictures in the work rooms were outdated. After the movement against American arming of Japan and the accusation of Japanese and American aggression crimes was launched in various places, the office's leaders did not recognize that the accusation meeting was the most effective way to raise workers' political consciousness and did not convene accusation meetings. They believed that there were not many employees in their office who had been persecuted by imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, and that they were not "typical enough," so they could not hold accusation meetings. In fact, there were quite a few employees in the office who had been persecuted by Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's gang special agents, especially among the newspaper delivery workers, many of whom had been beaten by Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. Zhou Guangwen, a worker in charge of machinery, had been beaten twice by the Japanese invaders and took a long time to recover. Because accusation meetings were not held, the hatred accumulated in the employees' hearts for many years could not be expressed, and the workers' political consciousness could not be raised.

Recently, the responsible cadres of the Telegraph Office's CCP branch, administration, and trade union examined the reasons for the failure of the patriotic production competition and found that the main reason was that they themselves did not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and therefore neglected the work of conducting current affairs education among the employees. Therefore, they have decided in April to combine the work of "establishing propagandists," "rectifying labor discipline," and "registering labor insurance cards" to mobilize all forces to vigorously carry out current affairs propaganda and patriotic education in various ways, and to mobilize all employees to accuse the crimes of Japanese and American imperialism and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, in order to raise the political consciousness of the employees, and to relaunch the patriotic production competition on this basis to welcome the "May 1st" Labor Day.

### 北京市电信局电报处爱国生产竞赛失败的教训

    爱国生产竞赛失败的教训
　　朱波
    北京市电信局电报处忽视对职工的时事政治宣传教育，使爱国生产竞赛运动遭到失败，这是值得各地引为教训的。该处共有六百多职工，分五十多个生产小组，但参加竞赛的只有三十个小组；而在竞赛开始后不久，有的小组就垮了台。据今年一月份的统计：三十个参加竞赛的生产小组有百分之六十以上垮了台；到了二月份，爱国生产竞赛运动已经几乎全部停止。工人思想相当混乱，生产情绪不安。不少职工仍然有恐美和崇美的思想，认为抗美援朝应该半途而废。个别落后工人，甚至还收听“美国之音”，并在职工中散布不良影响。因此，不但爱国生产竞赛运动没有搞起来，就连日常的生产工作也受了影响。例如有几个工人曾经在工作的时间跑出去活动调到华东去。这种溜班的现象，使工作遭受了很大的损失。其它如工人在工作时间睡觉、闲聊天，都是相当普遍的现象。
    电报处爱国生产竞赛运动为什么会失败呢？主要原因之一是领导干部满足于抗美援朝运动的表面成绩，而忽视了发动爱国生产竞赛运动的政治基础——解决工人思想问题，提高工人的政治觉悟。去年全国抗美援朝运动开始时，该处职工都热情地投入了这一运动。当时工人的情绪很高，一次即购买时事手册三百多本，壁报、黑板报、标语、图画等也都搞起来了。从表面上看，该处的抗美援朝运动已经起来，而且因为该处职工的文化程度较高，不少工人都能讲出一套抗美援朝的大道理。因此，该处领导干部就满足于这些表面成绩，以为他们的抗美援朝工作已经作得“差不多”了，因而对工人思想上最主要的问题——对美帝国主义的认识问题，没有想法求得解决。抗美援朝运动中召开的座谈会及所作时事报告等，也不是针对群众的思想问题的。后来虽然工人在座谈会上暴露了一些思想问题，领导干部也没有想办法帮助解决。就在这种情况下，领导干部认为“应该是转入实际行动”的时候了，于是匆匆忙忙地订出生产竞赛计划，召开生产竞赛运动的动员大会。参加竞赛的生产小组的竞赛条件，也没有经过工人很好酝酿和讨论，就正式开始了所谓竞赛。
    该处生产竞赛运动未能搞好的另一个原因，是未能经常地对工人进行时事政治教育。特别是从爱国生产竞赛运动开始以后，对工人的时事教育更加忽视。虽然领导干部有时也作时事报告，但参加的人数还不到全体职工的三分之一。工作房里的标语、图画都是过时了的。在反对美国武装日本，控诉日美的侵略罪行运动在各地展开后，该处领导人员没有认识控诉会乃是提高工人政治觉悟最有效的办法，没有召开控诉会。他们认为本处被帝国主义及蒋匪特务迫害的职工不多，而且又“不够典型”，因此无法开控诉会。实际上，该处受日寇、蒋匪帮特务迫害的职工并不少，尤其是送报的工人中，很多人被日寇及蒋匪特务毒打过。管理机械的工人周光雯曾被日寇毒打过两次，休养了好久才恢复健康。因为没有开控诉会，多年来积压在职工心中的仇恨得不到伸诉，工人的政治觉悟也就得不到提高。
    最近电报处中共支部、行政、工会的负责干部检查了爱国生产竞赛失败的原因，发现主要原因是由于他们自己对抗美援朝运动的伟大意义认识不足，因而忽视了在职工中进行时事教育的工作。因此，他们已决定在四月份结合着“建立宣传员”，“整顿劳动纪律”、“登记劳动保险卡片”等工作，动员全部力量以各种不同的方式，大力开展时事宣传和爱国教育，并发动全体职工控诉日、美帝国主义及其走狗蒋匪特务的罪行，以提高职工的政治觉悟，并在这个基础上重新开展爱国生产竞赛，来迎接“五一”劳动节。
