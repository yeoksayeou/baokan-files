Shandong Jiawang Coal Mine Only Focuses on Crash Coal Transport
	Over Sixty Workers Fall Ill from Overwork
	Over sixty workers in the loading and unloading team of the Jiawang Coal Mine in Shandong Province have fallen ill due to overwork caused by a crash coal transport campaign. Before the Spring Festival, the mine administration signed a contract with Jiawang Railway Station to transport 33,000 tons of coal from February 4th to 13th. They neither consulted the workers beforehand nor accurately considered the actual capacity of the loading and unloading team. They simply announced the contract details to the workers when carrying out the task. The workers, with increased awareness from the patriotic education of resisting America and aiding Korea, increased their working hours to fourteen hours a day to ensure the completion of the contract task. They switched from using coal baskets holding less than 200 jin [approximately 100 kg] to larger baskets holding 300 jin [approximately 150 kg]. On two occasions when the train was delayed (once for forty-five minutes, once for two hours), the workers waited on the coal piles in the wind and snow. Although they ultimately overfulfilled the task through a crash effort, more than five workers coughed up blood and over sixty fell ill due to overwork and poor working conditions.
	This incident fully demonstrates the serious bureaucratic style of the mine administration in its work. Not only did they fail to determine tasks based on the actual situation, but during implementation, they also failed to deeply understand the difficulties and suffering of the workers and find ways to help solve them in a timely manner. This incident also illustrates the harm of simply increasing labor intensity in production. The mine's trade union has now raised concerns with the administration, which has attracted their attention, and they plan to initially improve working conditions. As for the sick workers, they have been sent to hospitals for recuperation and treatment based on the severity of their conditions.

　　山东贾汪煤矿只管突击运煤        
    六十余工人积劳成病
    山东贾汪煤矿装卸队工人有六十余人因突击运煤工作而积劳成疾。该矿行政上在春节前与贾汪车站订立了自二月四日至十三日运煤三万三千吨的合同，事前既未向工人征求意见，又没有确切地考虑到装卸队的实际力量，只在执行任务时向工人简单宣读了一下合同内容。工人在抗美援朝的时事教育里觉悟程度提高，为了保证完成合同任务，每天将工作时间增加到十四小时。原用二百斤不到的煤筐抬煤，现改用三百斤大筐抬。有两次火车误点（一次四十五分钟、一次二小时），工人便在风雪下的煤堆上等候。最后虽突击超额完成了任务，但因劳动过度，工作条件恶劣，致使五人吐血，六十余人生病。
    这件事情充分证明了该矿行政上在工作中存在着严重的官僚主义作风，不但不根据实际情况来确定任务，而且在执行中又不去深入了解工作中的困难与工人的痛苦，而设法及时帮助解决。这件事同时也说明了在生产中单纯提高劳动强度的危害性。现该矿工会已向行政上提出意见，引起了行政上的重视，拟初步改善劳动条件。至于生病工人，已分别轻重送医院休养治疗。
