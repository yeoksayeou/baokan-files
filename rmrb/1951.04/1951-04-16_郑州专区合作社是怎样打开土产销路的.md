How the Zhengzhou Special District Cooperative Opened Up Sales Channels for Native Produce
    Han Huan

    I. Native Produce Situation

    The Zhengzhou Special District in Henan Province includes seven counties: Zheng County, Xinzheng, Rongyang, Gong County, Mi County, Dengfeng, and Chenggao, with a population of 1.9 million. The area has a large population and little land. In most areas, half of the farmers' living and production materials depend on income from native and special products. The main native and special products in the area include dates (annual pre-war production of 10 million jin), persimmon cakes (annual pre-war production of 20 million jin), peanuts (annual pre-war production of 10 million jin), mulberry bark, honeysuckle, millstones, straw braid, and more than 30 other varieties. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, most were sold in Guangzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an, Hebei, and other places. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the native produce market was destroyed, sales stagnated, and prices plummeted. For example, dates fell from one jin of dates being exchanged for one jin of wheat before the war to five liang of wheat, persimmon cakes fell from eleven liang of wheat to three liang of wheat, and mulberry bark fell from fifteen jin of wheat per bundle to three jin of wheat. Every year after the harvest, farmers were forced to sell cheap and buy dear. After liberation, the sales of native produce improved compared with the War of Resistance Against Japan, and prices also increased somewhat. However, due to the lack of widespread recovery of the commercial network, sales channels have not been completely smooth, and the problem of unsold native and special products has not been completely resolved. From the perspective of prices, before October 1950, the price of persimmon cakes could only reach 60% to 70% of the pre-war level. Farmers urgently requested cooperatives to organize purchases and open up sales channels.

    II. How to Open Up Sales Channels

    In August and September 1950, the Zhengzhou Special District Cooperative and county cooperatives began to be established. At that time, due to incorrect business orientation, the business of the cooperatives was largely limited to operating stores and pursuing profits, and the work of promoting native produce was not done well. At that time, the cooperatives did not understand the production and sales situation, were afraid of losing money, and disliked the trivial and troublesome nature of promoting native produce. Therefore, although some county cooperatives, at the request of farmers and in conjunction with the organization of cooperatives, purchased some native produce, the cooperatives did not actively seek sales channels, resulting in a backlog of funds and losses.

    In order to open up sales channels for native produce, the Zhengzhou Special District Cooperative first corrected the direction of business operations. Last November, the Special District Cooperative began to inspect and correct the tendency to not pay attention to organizing the promotion of native produce, and closed the stores. From that time on, the cooperative began to concentrate its efforts on organizing the promotion of native produce, and business gradually developed. For example, after Mi County Cooperative closed its stores last December and organized the promotion of native produce, the turnover increased by one-third compared with November. Before Zheng County Cooperative closed its stores in January, there was only one primary cooperative in the county with fewer than 500 members. However, from January after closing the stores to the end of March, the county had developed to nine primary cooperatives with more than 15,000 members, and at the same time promoted more than 60,000 jin of dates. Experience has shown that county cooperatives can only concentrate their efforts on organizing the promotion of native produce if they put down the burden of stores and correct the direction of business.

    Secondly, the Special District Cooperative took the lead in purchasing native produce and opening up sales channels. The Special District Cooperative wrote letters to relevant parties in Wuhan, Pingyuan, Xi'an, Hebei, and other places to introduce the local native produce situation and understand the types and quantities that could be promoted in various places; at the same time, in conjunction with the organization of cooperative work, it took the lead in purchasing native produce and actively promoting it. In December alone, the Special District Cooperative, in cooperation with the Provincial Cooperative Working Team, organized cooperatives in Chenggao and purchased 60,000 jin of persimmon cakes and some other native produce in 20 days. After the Special District Cooperative established contact with various places, the purchased native produce quickly found sales channels.

    Third, according to the production and sales situation, organize exchanges in a planned manner through necessary meetings. After the sales of native produce began to become active in January this year, the Special District Cooperative seized the opportunity to convene meetings of county cooperatives, summarize and exchange experiences, and carry out native produce promotion work. At the meeting, according to the product and sales situation, it was further determined to start from three aspects to organize exchanges. First: Organize exchanges within the county for products needed by the masses in the county. Second: For products needed by various counties in the Special District, sign contracts through meetings to organize exchanges. Third: For products that cannot be promoted in the Special District, the Special District Cooperative is responsible for finding sales channels. During the meeting, the counties signed ten contracts on the spot, exchanging 27,000 bundles of mulberry bark, 8,000 straw hats, and 100,000 jin of paper mulberry bark (paper-making raw material). After this period of exploration, the county cooperatives' fear that native produce could not be promoted, fear of losing money, and reluctance to organize native produce promotion ideas have been basically resolved after understanding the needs of production and sales, and promotion business has been further developed.

    Fourth, establish contact with cooperatives in neighboring areas. In order to open up sales channels for native produce in all aspects, the Special District Cooperative and cooperatives in neighboring areas must establish contact. In establishing this kind of contact, the three principles of fair prices, convenient purchase and sale, and adherence to credit were grasped to gain the trust of cooperatives in neighboring areas. From the beginning of January to mid-March, cooperatives from other areas directly came to the Zhengzhou Special District to purchase native produce, including the Pingyuan Yuanyang County Cooperative (ordering persimmon cakes, mulberry bark, millstones, and straw hats a total of four times), the Luoyang Special District Xin'an County Cooperative (entrusted to purchase a batch of hemp paper), and cooperatives from Handan and other eleven areas (purchasing Mi County's mulberry bark). Through the establishment of contact between the Special District Cooperative and cooperatives in neighboring areas, the sales channels for native produce were quickly expanded.

    III. Native Produce Situation After Sales Became Active

    Since the Zhengzhou Special District Cooperative comprehensively reversed its business direction and organized the promotion of native produce in January, the sales channels for native produce have been basically opened, and the prices of most native produce have reached pre-war standards. By mid-March, the native produce promoted through cooperatives included 440,000 jin of dates, 118,800 jin of persimmon cakes, 70,000 jin of straw braid, 160,000 straw hats, 40,000 bundles of mulberry bark, 3,000 bolts of homespun cloth and 260,179 square feet, 46,534 jin of cotton, 1,912 bundles of hemp paper (200 knives per bundle), 20,000 millstones, 8,800 jin of honeysuckle, and 2,480 jin of melon seeds. Due to smooth sales channels, Mi County's mulberry bark is currently in short supply, and the price per bundle has more than doubled compared with before October last year. Honeysuckle has also been completely sold out due to the small output. The sales of dates and persimmon cakes, which have the largest output and are more difficult to sell in the entire Special District, have reached about 70% of the output by the end of March.

    Due to the development of native produce sales, the Zhengzhou Special District Cooperative and county cooperatives have been warmly welcomed by the masses, and the cooperatives have gradually developed. From the beginning of organizing cooperatives in conjunction with promoting native produce in December last year to mid-March this year, more than 30 primary cooperatives have been developed in the entire Special District, and the number of members has increased by more than five times, laying a good foundation for the development of cooperative work in the future.

　　郑州专区合作社是怎样打开土产销路的
    韩寰
    一、土产情况
    河南郑州专区包括郑县、新郑、荣阳、巩县、密县、登封、成皋七个县，人口一百九十万。全区人多地少，大部地区农民一半生活、生产资料依靠土产与特产收入。全区主要的土产、特产有大枣（战前年产一千万斤），柿饼（战前年产二千万斤），花生（战前年产一千万斤），桑?、银花、磨石、草帽辫等三十余种。抗日战争前大部销售于广州、武汉、西安、河北等地。抗日战争时期，由于土产市场遭受破坏，销路停滞，土产价格惨跌。如大枣由战前每斤折换小麦一斤降到折换五两，柿饼由每斤折换小麦十一两降到折换三两，桑?由每把折小麦十五斤降到折换三斤。每年土产收获后，农民被迫贱卖、贵买。解放后土产销路已较抗日战争时期好转，价格也提高了一些。但由于商业网没有普遍恢复，销路还没有完全畅通，土产、特产品滞销问题仍未彻底解决。从价格上看，一九五○年十月份前，柿饼价格只能达到战前百分之六十到七十。农民迫切要求合作社组织收购，打开销路。
  二、怎样打开销路
    一九五○年八、九月间，郑州专区合作社和各县合作社开始建立。当时由于经营方向不正确，合作社的业务大部限于经营门市，追逐利润，推销土产的工作作得很不好。当时合作社不了解产销情况，怕赔钱，嫌推销土产琐碎、麻烦，因此有些县社虽然在农民的要求下，结合合作社的组织工作，收购了一部分土产，但因合作社不主动找销路，结果积压了资金，受到了损失。
    郑州专区合作社为了打开土产销路，首先端正业务经营方向。去年十一月，专区合作社开始检查纠正了不重视组织土产推销工作的偏向，并关闭了门市部。从这个时候起，合作社便开始集中力量组织土产推销，在业务上也逐渐获得发展。如密县合作社在去年十二月关闭门市部，组织土产推销后，结果营业额比十一月份增加了三分之一。郑县合作社在一月份关闭门市部以前，全县只有一个基层社，社员不到五百人，但在一月份关闭门市部以后到三月底止，全县已发展到九个基层社，一万五千多个社员，同时推销了大枣六万多斤。经验证明，各县合作社只有放下门市部的包袱，端正业务方向，才能集中力量组织土产推销。
    其次是专区合作社带头收购土产，打开销路。该专区合作社一面向武汉、平原、西安、河北等地有关方面写信介绍本地土产情况，了解各地所能推销的种类和数量；一面结合组织合作社工作，带头收购土产主动推销。该专区合作社仅在去年十二月份，配合省合作社工作队在成皋组织合作社时，二十天即收购柿饼六万斤，和其他土产一部。该专区合作社和各地取得联系后，已收购的土产很快就找到了销路。
    第三，根据产销情况，通过必要的会议有计划地组织交流。今年一月间土产销路开始活跃后，专区合作社又抓紧召开各县合作社会议，总结交流经验、开展土产推销工作。会上根据产品、销路的情况，进一步确定由三方面入手，组织交流。第一：本县群众需要的产品组织县内交流，第二：本专区各县需要的产品，通过会议签订合同组织交流，第三：本专区推销不了的产品，由专区社负责寻找销路。在会议中，各县当场签订了十件合同，交换物资有桑?二万七千把，草帽八千顶，构皮（造纸原料）十万斤。各县合作社怕土产推销不了，怕赔钱，不敢动手组织土产推销的思想，经过这一段摸索，了解了产销需要后，已得到了基本解决，推销业务得到了进一步的发展。
    第四，和友邻地区合作社建立联系。为了从各方面打开土产销路，专区合作社和友邻地区合作社必须建立联系。建立这种联系时，掌握了价格公道、购销便利、坚守信用三个原则，取得友邻地区合作社的信任。由一月份开始到三月中旬，外区直接到郑州专区购买土产的已有平原原阳县合作社（前后订购柿饼、桑?、磨石、草帽共四起）、洛阳专区新安县合作社（委托代购麻纸一批）及邯郸等十一个地区的合作社（购买密县的桑?）。经过专区合作社和友邻地区合作社建立联系，很快就扩大了土产的销路。
  三、销路活跃后的土产情况
    郑州专区合作社从一月份全面扭转业务方向，组织土产推销以来，土产销路已基本打开，大部土产价格已达到战前标准。到三月中旬止，通过合作社组织推销的土产已有大枣四十四万斤，柿饼一十一万八千八百斤，草帽辫七万斤，草帽一十六万顶，桑?四万把，土布三千匹又二十六万零一百七十九方尺，棉花四万六千五百三十四斤，麻纸一千九百一十二绳（每绳二百刀），磨石二万块，银花八千八百斤，瓜子二千四百八十斤。密县桑?由于销路畅通，目前已供不应求，每把价格比去年十月份前提高了一倍以上，银花也因产量过小，全部销完。全专区产量最大销路较难的大枣、柿饼，到三月底销量已达产量的百分之七十左右。
    由于土产销路的开展，郑州专区合作社和各县合作社受到群众热烈欢迎，合作社也逐步得到了发展。由去年十二月份结合推销土产进行组织合作社开始，到今年三月中旬止，全专区已发展了三十多个基层社，社员人数也增加了五倍以上，给今后合作社工作的发展打下了良好的基础。
