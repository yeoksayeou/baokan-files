　　Yang Xiandong, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Central Government, sent a letter to this newspaper from Shandong on March 29, reporting exciting news from the cotton-producing areas of Shandong: On March 17, we went to Huimin, Dezhou, Wuqiao, Dongguang, and other places to understand the specific situations at the special district, county, and village levels. I participated in a county-wide cadre meeting above the township level in Wuqiao, invited labor models to a symposium, and visited several old farmers. They were very satisfied with the cotton-grain price ratio last year, which remained at the level of one jin of ginned cotton to eight to ten jin of millet throughout the year. Only in the implementation of the policy of "better cotton, better price," the mastery of grading technology was not good enough, and deviations sometimes occurred. I saw the improved lives of farmers after the bumper cotton harvest, the soaring enthusiasm for production, and the active work enthusiasm of cadres at all levels, which made me very excited.

　　All parts of Shandong have integrated the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement with the cotton production movement, launching a patriotic production upsurge. The masses have put forward slogans such as "Patriotic Cotton," "Cotton for National Prosperity and People's Wealth," and "Love the Country and Get Rich, Plant More Cotton." Governments at all levels have taken cotton planting as the central task of current production work. The province, special districts, and counties have all held or are holding cadre meetings. Villages, through party branch meetings, party and league member meetings, representative meetings from all walks of life, and cotton farmer representative meetings, have thoroughly implemented the cotton planting task and cotton-grain price ratio policy among the masses, basically achieving universal awareness. From leading comrades of governments at all levels to the masses, everyone has confidence in completing the cotton planting task.

　　Due to the bumper cotton harvest last year, farmers' investment capacity has generally increased. They have prepared more fertilizer than last year, repaired and added farm tools, and increased livestock. In Wuqiao County, the number of livestock increased from 25,000 in 1949 to more than 29,000 in November 1950. An investigation of seven old farmers in Lao Ya Zhang Village showed that they planned to plant 48 mu of cotton this year and had prepared 1,600 jin of soybean cake and 300 jin of black beans as fertilizer. The improvement of farmers' lives can be seen in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The amount of cotton used by themselves has increased. Farmers in cotton-producing areas rarely wear patched clothes, and many women and children under the age of 30 wear foreign cloth and printed cloth. According to surveys of two villages, farmers' self-use of cotton accounts for 8 to 10 percent of the total cotton production, with each person using five to seven jin of ginned cotton. The food has also improved a lot, and the amount of wheat consumed has increased from 5 percent to about 17 percent. Labor model Xu Bingyin said that his family ate corn all year round in 1949, but now they eat wheat food once every five days. The amount of meat sold in the market in Yuji Village has increased sixfold compared to before the war. In the past, there were only two meat shops, but now there are ten. Every village is repairing houses, with every household doing minor repairs and renovations, and new houses accounting for more than 10 percent. There are 120 households in Manzhuang Village, and more than 40 households have built new houses or renovated houses. Bicycles and flashlights have increased a lot in cotton-producing areas. More than one hundred new bicycles have been added to a district in Liangji, and an average of one flashlight per two households. Cultural education in cotton-producing areas is also advancing by leaps and bounds. In the Liangji District of Wuqiao, there were more than 2,000 primary school students in 1949, and now the number has increased to more than 4,000. The farmers who had a bumper harvest enjoyed themselves during the Spring Festival. Four carts of firecrackers were sold in one market day in Liangji District. In short, this bumper year not only made up for the losses caused by the disasters of the past two years, but also allowed them to have some surplus. Now farmers in the Wuqiao and Huimin cotton-producing areas still have 15 to 25 percent of their cotton in storage.

　　Shandong's wheat seedlings are growing well and a good harvest is expected. The province is not short of food and still has some reserves.

### 山东棉农生活显著提高  现正结合抗美援朝运动掀起爱国生产热潮

　　山东棉农生活显著提高        
    现正结合抗美援朝运动掀起爱国生产热潮
    中央农业部副部长杨显东三月二十九日自山东致函本报，报道了山东棉产区令人兴奋的情况称：三月十七日我们分赴惠民、德州、吴桥、东光等地了解了专区、县、村各级的具体情况，我在吴桥参加了乡以上的全县干部大会，邀请劳动模范座谈，并访问了几位老农。他们对去年的棉粮比价很满意，全年始终在一斤皮棉比八斤至十斤小米的水平，只是在优棉优价政策的执行上，分级技术的掌握还不够好，有时发生偏差。我看到了棉花丰收后好转的农民生活，高涨的生产情绪，和各级干部们的积极工作热情，使我非常兴奋。
    山东各地都把抗美援朝运动和棉花生产运动融汇在一起，掀起了爱国生产热潮，群众提出了“爱国棉”、“民富国强棉”、“爱国发家，多种棉花”等口号。各级政府都把植棉当作了当前生产工作的中心任务，省、专区、县都已召开过或正在开干部会，村里通过党的支部会，党、团员会，各界代表会，棉农代表会等，把植棉任务及棉粮比价政策已贯彻布置到群众中，基本上做到了家喻户晓。从各级政府领导同志一直到群众，都有信心完成植棉任务。
    由于去年棉花丰收，农民投资能力普遍增大，准备下了较去年更多的肥料，修理并添置了农具，增加了牲口。吴桥县全县一九四九年有二万五千头牲口，一九五○年十一月调查已增到二万九千多头。在老鸦张庄调查了七户老农，他们今年计划种四十八亩棉花，已准备下一千六百斤豆饼、三百斤黑豆做肥料。农民生活，在衣、食、住、行上都可以看出来已经相当的提高。自用棉量增多了，棉区里农民已很少有穿补钉的衣服，三十岁以下的妇女及小孩很多都穿洋布，花布。根据两个村的调查，农民自用棉量占全部棉花产量的百分之八至十，每人用五至七斤皮棉。吃食上也好得多了，小麦的食用量由百分之五增到了百分之十七左右。劳动模范徐丙寅说，他家一九四九年全年都在吃玉米，现在每五天要吃一次面食。于集村集市上的售肉量比战前增加了六倍，过去只有两个肉铺，现在有十个肉铺。每个村庄都在修理房屋，家家户户小修小补，盖新房的占百分之十以上。满庄村有一百二十户，盖新房和翻修房的就有四十多户。自行车、手电筒在棉区增加了很多。梁集一个区新添自行车有百余辆，平均两家有一个手电筒。棉区的文化教育也在突飞猛进，吴桥梁集区一九四九年小学学生有两千多人，现在增到了四千多人。丰收的农民在春节都尽情狂欢，梁集区一个集日售出了四车鞭炮。总之，这一个丰年，不但补上了二年的因灾情所受的损失，还都能够有些剩余，现在吴桥、惠民棉区的农民还存着百分之十五至百分之二十五的棉花。
    山东麦苗生长很好，可望丰收，现在全省食粮不缺，尚有存余。
