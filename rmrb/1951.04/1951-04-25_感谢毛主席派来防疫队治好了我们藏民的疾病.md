“Thank Chairman Mao for Sending a Disease Prevention Team to Cure the Diseases of Our Tibetan People”

    The Seventh Detachment of the Central Epidemic Prevention Corps, acting on Chairman Mao's orders, came to the Labrang Tibetan area in Gansu Province to carry out health and medical work, relieving our minority brothers from the suffering of disease. In the three and a half months of work in Labrang, they have treated more than 20,000 patients; and sent treatment teams to cross snow-capped mountains more than 3,000 feet high, going deep into pastoral areas to treat the masses of herdsmen.

    The Tibetan man, A Zhou, was suffering from severe vasculitis. When he heard the news that the Central Epidemic Prevention Team had come to Labrang, he rode his horse from Xikang, traveling for more than a month on the road, and when he arrived, his right leg was so swollen that he could not move. After half a month of treatment and care by the comrades of the Epidemic Prevention Team, he was cured. In order to express his gratitude to Chairman Mao, he specially sent a red brocade banner to the Central Epidemic Prevention Team, which read: "Chairman Mao! You care about the suffering of our Tibetan people and sent an epidemic prevention team to cure our diseases. We are extremely grateful to you!" His fingerprints were also clearly printed on the banner. When he went back, he bought a portrait of Chairman Mao and took it back to his hometown in the grasslands of Xikang with great care.

    “感谢毛主席派来防疫队治好了我们藏民的疾病”编辑同志：
    中央防疫总队第七大队奉了毛主席的命令，来到甘肃省拉卜楞藏区开展卫生医疗工作，为少数民族兄弟们解除疾病的痛苦。在拉卜楞三个半月的工作中，他们已治疗了两万多病人；并派出治疗小组翻越三千多尺高的雪山，深入牧畜地区为牧民群众治病。
    藏民埃周，患着很严重的血管炎，他听到中央防疫队来到拉卜楞的消息，即从西康骑马奔来，路上走了一个多月，到达时右腿已经肿得不能动弹了。经过防疫队同志半个月的治疗和护理，他的病已痊愈了。为了表示他对毛主席的谢意，特送给中央防疫队一面红锦旗，上面写着：“毛主席！您关怀我们藏族人民的痛苦，派来了防疫队，治好了我们的疾病。我们万分的感谢您！”旗上还清楚地按着他的指纹印。当他回去的时候，又买了一张毛主席的像，十分慎重地带回西康草地家乡去。
