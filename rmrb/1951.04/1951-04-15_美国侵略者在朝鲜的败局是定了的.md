　　The downfall of MacArthur, the commander-in-chief of the American Far East invasion forces, is a victory for the anti-American struggle of the Chinese and Korean people, and also a victory for the world's people in opposing wars of aggression and defending world peace.
    MacArthur was the chief steward sent by American imperialism to the Far East to enslave and invade the Eastern people. He came to Asia before World War II to engage in aggression and plunder. From 1945, he abused his authority as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces to implement the American imperialist policy of enslaving the Japanese people. Last year, when the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, MacArthur was appointed as the so-called "Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces," commanding the American and its accomplice's invading forces to massacre the Korean people, forcibly occupy China's Taiwan, and bomb China's border. In the Korean War, the American aggressors used more than half of the American army, and initially possessed advantages in naval and air forces and weaponry, but under the heroic resistance of the Korean People's Army, the American aggressors and their accomplices repeatedly failed. Especially since the Chinese People's Volunteers have assisted the Korean people in combat, the blows suffered by the American invading forces have become increasingly serious. The American aggressors originally intended to use the invasion of Korea as a springboard to attack the Chinese mainland, but now the Korean War has been going on for almost ten months, and even American officials cannot but admit that the American military casualties have reached one-fifth of the total American casualties in World War II (in fact, the number of American military casualties is far higher than this); and more importantly, the future of the war is becoming increasingly dim for the invaders. Precisely because of this, serious divisions have occurred within the American ruling group and within the imperialist camp, and they have been blaming and quarreling with each other. Under such circumstances, Truman had no choice but to dismiss MacArthur, who he himself had praised as "America's great soldier and statesman" but who was actually a war criminal implementing America's policy of aggression against the East. Obviously, MacArthur fell under the iron fist of the anti-American struggle of the Chinese and Korean people; it marks the failure of American imperialist aggression policy and war policy, and the victory of the world's people in opposing American aggression and defending world peace.
    However, the American aggressors have not learned the lessons they should have learned from the failure of the Korean War. It still persists in this unjust war of aggression, and it still attempts to expand this war. The replacement of MacArthur by Ridgway, the commander of the US Eighth Army in the invasion of Korea, proves that the American aggressors are determined to persist in the military adventure of invading Korea, and have not abandoned their crazy attempt to expand the war in Korea. Before announcing MacArthur's dismissal, the American aggressors continuously sent eighty aircraft to frantically and indiscriminately bomb our territories of Andong, Kuandian, Ji'an, and Linjiang for three days on March 30, March 31, and April 7; and on the same day that MacArthur was dismissed, that is, April 11, the American aggressors actually invaded the airspace over our Fujian coast with more than 200 aircraft and strafed the peaceful residents of Fuzhou; on the second day after MacArthur was dismissed, that is, April 12, the American aggressors again dispatched more than 70 aircraft to bomb the urban area and suburbs of Andong, killing our peaceful people. This proves that the American robbers not only have no intention of repenting, but are also extending their claws of aggression and expanding their scope of killing day by day. From this, it can be seen that the replacement of MacArthur by Ridgway is Truman's attempt to shirk responsibility for the failure of the Korean War and cover up his conspiracy to continue and expand the war. Therefore, the Chinese people cannot relax their efforts in the slightest, and should continue to strengthen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, resolutely support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, resist the attacks of the American aggressors, and make them completely defeated.

### 美国侵略者在朝鲜的败局是定了的

　　美国侵略者在朝鲜的败局是定了的
    美国远东侵略军总司令麦克阿瑟的下台，是中朝人民抗美斗争的胜利，也是世界人民反对侵略战争保卫世界和平的一个胜利。
    麦克阿瑟是美国帝国主义派在远东奴役和侵略东方人民的总管。他在第二次世界大战前就来亚洲，从事侵略和掠夺事业。一九四五年起，他就滥用盟军最高统帅的职权，执行美国帝国主义奴役日本人民的政策。去年，美国发动侵略朝鲜的战争，麦克阿瑟即被任命为所谓“联合国军总司令”，指挥美国及其帮凶们的侵略军，屠杀朝鲜人民，强占中国台湾，轰炸中国边境。美国侵略者在朝鲜战争中，使用了半数以上的美国陆军，并一开始即占有海空军和武器装备方面的优势，但在朝鲜人民军的英勇抗击之下，美国侵略者及其帮凶们一再失败。特别是自从中国人民志愿部队协助朝鲜人民作战以来，美国侵略军所遭受的打击更日益严重。美国侵略者原以侵略朝鲜作为进攻中国大陆的跳板，但现在侵朝战争已经进行了快十个月，就连美国官方也不能不承认美军的伤亡，已达美军在第二次世界大战中伤亡总数的五分之一（其实，美军的伤亡数字远高于此）；而且更重要的是，战争的前途对于侵略者是越来越暗淡了。正因为如此，美国统治集团的内部和帝国主义阵营内部，发生了严重的分歧，他们相互埋怨，相互争吵。在这样的情况下，杜鲁门就不得不把这个曾被他自己称誉为“美国伟大的军人和政治家”而实际是执行美国侵略东方政策的战犯的麦克阿瑟撤职。很显然，麦克阿瑟是在中朝两国人民的抗美斗争的铁拳打击之下倒台的；它标志着美国帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的失败，世界人民反对美国侵略保卫世界和平的胜利。
    但美国侵略者并未从侵朝战争的失败中，取得应有的教训。它仍然坚持这个不义的侵略战争，它仍然企图扩大这个战争。以侵略朝鲜的美国第八军军长李奇微去代替麦克阿瑟，证明美国侵略者决心坚持侵略朝鲜的军事冒险，而且也并未放弃扩大侵朝战争的疯狂企图。美国侵略者在宣布将麦克阿瑟撤职以前，连续地派了八十架飞机，在三月三十日、三十一日和四月七日三天，疯狂地滥炸我国领土安东、宽甸、辑安、临江；而在麦克阿瑟被撤职的同一天，即四月十一日，美国侵略者竟以二百多架飞机，侵入我福建沿海上空，并扫射我福州和平居民；在麦克阿瑟被撤职的第二天，即四月十二日，美国侵略者又派遣了七十多架飞机，轰炸我安东市区和郊外，杀害我和平人民。这证明美国强盗不但毫无悔祸之心，而且正在一天天地伸张它的侵略魔手，扩大它的杀人范围。由此可见，以李奇微代替麦克阿瑟，是杜鲁门企图推卸侵朝战争的失败责任，而掩饰其继续战争和扩大战争的阴谋。中国人民因此丝毫不能松懈自己的努力，应该再接再厉，加强抗美援朝运动，坚决支援中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军，抵抗美国侵略者的进攻，使之彻底失败。
