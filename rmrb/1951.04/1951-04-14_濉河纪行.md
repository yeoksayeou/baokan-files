　　Sui River Travelogue
　　By Our Reporter Gu Weijin
　　The "Ukraine" of Northern Anhui
　　Entering eastern Northern Anhui, we can see the Sui River, one of the main tributaries on the northern bank of the Huai River. It originates in Xiao County, meandering through Suixi County, Su County, Lingbi County, Si County, and Sihong County, finally entering Hongze Lake. Along this 234-kilometer-long Sui River, there used to be a vast fertile plain. It once grew millions of acres of good wheat. In the words of the farmers, "The wheat grew more than a person tall, so dense that even snakes couldn't get through." It also produced sesame, sorghum, and soybeans in abundance. People called this area the "Ukraine of Northern Anhui."
　　However, since 1938 when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits breached the Yellow River dike at Huayuankou in Henan, diverting the Yellow River water into the Huai River, the Huai River system deteriorated, and the Sui River became a silted river, frequently causing inland flooding. The fertile land along the Sui River has suffered from flood disasters year after year.
　　Currently, in the Huai River management project in Northern Anhui, the inland flooding problems of the two main tributaries of the Huai River—the West Fei River and the Sui River—must be resolved. Solving the inland flooding problems of these two tributaries will bring a bountiful harvest to seven million acres of fertile land. However, among the dredging projects to solve the inland flooding problems of these two rivers, the Sui River project is the most arduous.
　　Digging a River from Flat Ground in Ice and Snow
　　In the middle reaches of the Sui River, between Lingbi County and Si County, I witnessed an astonishing miracle—digging a river from flat ground.
　　Because the terrain in the middle reaches of the Sui River is low-lying, making it difficult to drain water, inland flooding occurs frequently. This time, the river course was diverted between Lingbi and Si County—digging a new river channel of more than 30 kilometers long, 65 meters wide, and 3.5 meters deep from flat ground. Here, it seemed like a water kingdom. Digging six or seven inches deep, underground water would gush out; the deeper you dug, the more water gushed out. This harsh situation tells people that the river is very difficult to dig.
　　However, the people along the Sui River are all outstanding sons and daughters who have been tempered in battles. They have never succumbed to difficulties, and now they are determined to dig the river down.
　　The first step in digging the river is drainage. Only by draining the water can the soil be taken. But the difficulty is that the surrounding area is flat, where can the water be drained to? The wisdom of the masses overcame the difficulties. Long ditches (i.e., vertical and horizontal ditches) were dug in the central area of the river to drain water. Naturally, underground water still gushed out when digging the Long ditches. So the masses came up with another solution: before digging the Long ditches, embankments were built on both sides of the Long ditches to form earthen ponds. Every time a section of Long ditch was dug, the water inside was bailed into the earthen pond. After the Long ditch was dug, the water in the earthen pond was poured back into the Long ditch, and the water in the Long ditch was led into the river. This was considered a solution to the difficulty of drainage. But the underground water came very quickly, rising an inch every eight minutes. Therefore, after drainage, the soil must be dug quickly, and water must be drained quickly when water is seen. This is truly a very complex and tense project. But even that is not enough to describe it. It must be explained that this project was not carried out in the warm spring, but in the severe winter (during the winter repair period). How many unimaginable difficulties are contained in this!
　　At first, when the cold wind gently drifted from the river, when the river water was only slightly freezing, it was still possible to go into the water to dig the river. However, as the weather gradually turned cold, when ice and snow appeared on the river, it was very difficult to go into the water to dig the river. But at this time, tens of thousands of brave and fearless river workers swept away the vast snow covering dozens of miles of the river, broke the ice on the river with sticks, went into the river to drain water and take soil; used water pumps to pump water, used dragon-bone waterwheels, used bamboo baskets, buckets, and basins to bail water, used iron shovels to scoop up silt, and used grappling hooks to pry open frozen soil. In this situation, the wet pants of many people turned into ice buckets; the thighs inside the "ice buckets" were frozen red and swollen. Some people's hands and feet were cracked with frostbite, and their shoulders were rubbed raw from carrying soil; but even so, could you see any fear of difficulty on their faces? No. Many migrant workers in Chengguan and Fengmiao Township in Lingbi County had frostbite cracks one or two fingers deep; but they wrapped the wounds with thread or cloth and silently went into the water to work. At night, the weather was terrifyingly cold, but as long as the cold moon was in the sky, as long as the tools could break the ice on the river, the river was still filled with black masses of people. While working, they sang here and there those songs that showed their inner joy and strong will: "Digging the river is good, digging the river is good, dig the Sui River well and we'll have enough to eat! Add oil to bail (water), work hard to scoop (mud), it's like adding a new cotton coat!"
　　Under their unyielding struggle against ice and snow, the prototype of a new river channel of more than 30 kilometers long has appeared before people's eyes.
　　Attacking the Hard Conglomerate
　　In the middle and lower reaches of the Sui River, between Si County and Sihong, I saw another scene of the outstanding sons and daughters along the Sui River defeating nature.
　　Here, there is a section of river channel nearly 40 kilometers long, densely covered with conglomerate, which is a combination of sand and gravel as hard as iron and stone. It is one or two inches to one or two meters deep. The small conglomerate is like chicken eggs and fists, and the large ones are like sledgehammers and earth baskets. In the Kuhetou area, in addition to the conglomerate in the river, there are also conglomerate layers standing on both banks for more than ten kilometers, the large conglomerate layers like bull heads or tabletops. According to the requirements of the project, the conglomerate in the river must be dug out, and the conglomerate layers on both banks must be cut off, so that the river channel becomes wider and deeper.
　　At first, the migrant workers did not estimate that the conglomerate and conglomerate layers were so hard. Relying on their vigorous strength, they waved tens of thousands of iron shovels, grappling hooks, and steel forks to attack the conglomerate and conglomerate layers; but as a result, they had not dug even an inch deep, and all the tools were either broken or chipped. To deal with this tough enemy, drilling machines were dispatched immediately. However, in some places, the drilling machines could not drill down. The migrant workers had to adopt this method: first, dig a large hole under the conglomerate, and then use tools to hammer down from above, so that the conglomerate would fall off. However, even if this method was adopted—and this method of digging holes could only be applied to the conglomerate layers on the river bank, not to the conglomerate in the river, the project was still very difficult.
　　Did you see them digging the conglomerate layer on the river bank? They crawled or knelt down to dig holes inch by inch under the conglomerate layer, their hands blistered, the blisters turned into calluses, and sand grains flew into their faces like nails, causing pain; sometimes, the holes were not dug well, and the conglomerate layer above collapsed, injuring people's limbs. Did you see them digging conglomerate in the river? In winter, breaking the ice on the river and stepping into the water was cold enough to be unbearable, but in some places the conglomerate in the water was like sharp teeth, stabbing the soles of their feet, and they dug conglomerate with all their might while stepping on these "sharp teeth." When the conglomerate was dug more than a meter deep, either their feet were pierced or their whole body became muddy.
　　However, this arduous project is nothing to be feared for these outstanding river workers who have been tempered in long-term struggles, on the contrary, it can show their heroic qualities. Han Luqi, a migrant worker from Xinwu Township in Si County, was working on top of an eight-foot-high conglomerate layer when suddenly the conglomerate layer collapsed and he fell down with it, injuring his hand; everyone advised him to rest, but he said: "If my hand is broken and I can't dig, I can still carry soil." So he started carrying soil. Xie Litai, a migrant worker from the same township, was buried in sand when digging the conglomerate layer, and everyone dug him out with their hands. He took a few breaths and silently started working again. Li Ge, a woman from Tongnan Township who participated in digging the river, was seriously injured in the thigh when digging conglomerate, she was sent to the hospital, she knew that she would not be able to do this work in the future, but she still actively asked to leave the hospital to go to the construction site. She said, "I can't do heavy work, but I can cook." Her husband, Li Kang, who was digging conglomerate with her, although he saw that she was seriously injured at the time and felt a little uncomfortable, only went to see her twice in the thirty-two days since she entered the hospital. During these days, he silently completed the project that his wife had not completed.
　　Under the heroic and selfless work of the migrant workers, the 40-kilometer-long iron-stone hard conglomerate was gradually conquered. The continuous improvement of work efficiency can be seen: at first, the efficiency per person per day was 0.2 cubic meters, then it increased to 0.6 cubic meters, then to 0.8 cubic meters, and the highest reached more than one cubic meter.
　　Unforgettable Years of Disaster, Yearning for a Better Future
　　On the long Sui River line, the brave and hardworking deeds created by these outstanding migrant workers are endless. The reason why they are so brave and hardworking is because they cannot forget the past years of disaster and yearn for a better future.
　　The people along the Sui River are very resentful when they mention the river management in the Kuomintang era. They said, "Officials get rich, and the common people suffer." They sang a song like this: "Mentioning digging the river is heartbreaking, the district chief builds a building, the township chief builds a tile house, the Bao chief builds a brick wall, the Jia chief takes the head and tail and deducts a few coins, and the common people are in tears!" They saw clearly that the river management in the Kuomintang era was deception and plunder. What was the result? Migrant workers in Siyang and Sihong County (newly established county) said it right: "We paid money, we put in effort, we dug the river every year, and we were flooded every year!" The tragic scene of the flooding is something they will never forget: the vast water flooded six or seven million acres of land every year, and more than one million people struggled on the brink of hunger and cold. Didn't the people along the Sui River praise the prosperity of their villages: "Golden Dazhuang, Silver Tushan, Li Qi's house is half the sky (meaning he has money to cover half the sky), money is still with the Jian Wu family (the first four villages are all in Lingbi County)." But since suffering from floods year after year, what have these villages become? There has been no autumn harvest for five years, and no wheat harvest for two or three years. People live on bran and wild vegetables. In the past, there were herds of cattle and horses in the village, but now there are no cattle or horses. In the past, the village was full of trees, but now there are only a few small trees with watermarks. There is no firewood for cooking, so the houses are torn down and used as fuel. Burning the houses is not enough to live in, so two families live in one house. "Golden Dazhuang" is already called "Guangliaozhuang" (Emptied Village).
　　Yes, the people along the Sui River cannot forget the disasters of the past. But they also cannot forget that the people's government saved them from the disasters. Since liberation, the people's government has vigorously carried out production and disaster relief year after year: distributing relief grain, distributing seeds, distributing winter clothes, leading sideline production, carrying out river management, and using work as relief. In this way, they climbed out of the disaster. As the people in the light and severely affected areas of Lingbi, Si County, and Sihong said: "Now we eat, wear, live, plant (seeds), use, Chairman Mao has taken care of us, and we have some hope."
　　Now they recall the days of the past and look at the present time, and their hearts are full of a new hope—manage the Sui River well and live a good life. Farmers in Suinan Township in Si County said: "As long as we dig the river well, this place will be a pile of grain, and we will have everything." Farmers by Hongze Lake said: "Our place can get rich, and people can starve to death (the land by the lake is good, yielding 300-400 jin per mu, which is like getting rich; but it is often flooded, and if it is flooded, people will starve to death), dig the river well, and we will always get rich." Farmers in Suxian and Lingbi hope to manage the river well, and after a few good wheat harvests, they will be able to build houses, add livestock, and marry a wife. Farmers in Longji, Sihong County, hope to manage the river well, harvest grain, send their children to school, and no longer be blind for generations.
　　The people along the Sui River know how to realize this beautiful future.

　　濉河纪行
    本报记者  古维进
  淮北的“乌克兰”
    进入皖北东，我们便可以看到淮河北岸的主要支流之一的濉河。它从萧县的发源地，弯弯曲曲地流经濉溪县、宿县、灵璧县、泗县、泗洪县，最后进入洪泽湖。在这一条长达二百三十四公里的濉河沿岸。原是一片肥沃无垠的平原。这里曾经长着数百万亩的好小麦。用农民的话来说就是：“麦子长得一人多高，密密的，蛇都窜不进去。”这里也盛产芝麻、高粱、大豆。人们把这块地区称为“淮北的乌克兰”。
    但是，自一九三八年蒋匪在河南花园口炸开黄河大堤，黄水夺淮，淮河水系败坏以后，濉河便变成了一条淤塞的河流，经常发生内涝，濉河沿岸这一片肥沃的土地，便连年遭受到洪水的灾害。
    目前在皖北治理淮河的工程中，有淮河的两条主要支流——西淝河和濉河——的内涝问题必须解决。解决了这两条支流的内涝问题，就会使七百万亩沃土得到丰收。但在解决这两条河的内涝问题的疏浚工程中，要算濉河工程最艰巨了。
  在冰雪中平地挖河
    在濉河中游即灵璧县与泗县之间，我看见了一种惊人的奇迹——平地挖河。
    由于濉河中游地势低洼，不便宣泄，经常发生内涝，这次便在灵璧至泗县之间改道挖河——从平地挖出一条三十余公里长，六十五公尺宽，三公尺五公寸深的新河道。这里好像是水国，挖土六七公寸深，地下的水便源源涌出；再挖下去，水涌的更多。这种恶劣的情况，告诉人们河是很难挖下去的。
    但是濉河沿岸的人民，都是久经战斗锻炼的优秀儿女，他们从没有在困难面前屈服过，现在也决心要把河挖下去。
    挖河的第一步工程就是排水，排掉水才能取土。但是困难的是周围都是平地，水排到什么地方去呢？群众的智慧克服了困难。在挖河的中心地带挖龙沟（即纵横沟）排水。自然，挖龙沟时地下的水仍然要涌出来的。于是群众又想出了办法：在挖龙沟之前，在龙沟两旁筑起堤堰，围成土塘，每挖一段龙沟，就把里头的水戽到土塘，龙沟挖成，再把土塘的水倒回龙沟，而龙沟的水则引到河里。这样算是解决排水的困难。但是地下的水来得非常快，每八分钟就可以涨一寸水。因此排水之后，必须迅速挖土，挖土见水，又必须迅速排水。这真是一段非常复杂紧张的工程。但是这样说还是不够的。必须说明，这个工程不是在暖和的春日，是在严寒的冬天（冬修期间）进行的。这里面包含多少难于设想的困难呵。
    开始，当寒风轻轻地从河上飘过的时候，当河水才有点冻人的时候，下水挖河还是可以的。但是，天气渐渐冷了，冰和雪出现在河上的时候，这时下水挖河真是非常困难的。但是，就在这个时候，数万勇敢无畏的河工，扫除河上数十里地的茫茫积雪，用棍子打破河上的冰，下河排水取土；用抽水机抽水，用龙骨水车，用笆斗、桶、盆戽水，用铁锹捞起淤泥，用抓钩撬开冻土。在这种情况下，许多人湿掉的裤子都变成了冰桶；“冰桶”里面的大腿冻得红肿。有些人的手足冻裂了，肩膊抬土磨烂了；但是就是这样，你能看到他们有畏难之色么？没有。灵璧县城关和冯庙乡等地的民工，不少的人手足冻裂一二指深；但是他们用线或布把伤口包缠起来，又默默地下水工作。夜里，天气才冷得怕人呢，但是，只要寒月当空的时候，只要工具可以打破河上冰的时候，河里仍然是布满着黑黝黝的人群。他们一面工作，一面这里那里的唱起那显示内心的喜悦和刚强的意志的歌谣：“扒河（治河）好，扒河好，扒好濉河吃得饱！加油戽（水）下劲捞（泥），如同添件新棉袄！”
    他们不屈不挠地和冰雪斗争之下，一条三十余公里长的新河道的雏形，已经出现在人们的面前了。
  向坚硬的砂礓进攻
    在濉河的中、下游即泗县至泗洪之间，我又看见濉河沿岸的优秀儿女战胜自然的另一个场面。
    这里，有一段将近四十公里地的河道，密布着砂土和石子结合起来的像铁石般坚硬的砂礓。它有一二公寸至一二公尺深。小的砂礓像鸡卵、拳头，大的像铁锤、土筐。在枯河头一带，除了河里有砂礓，两岸还耸立着十余公里地的砂礓层，大的砂礓层像牛头或桌面。根据工程的要求，必须把河里的砂礓挖掉，把两岸的砂礓层削掉，使河道变得更宽更深。
    开始，民工没有估计到砂礓和砂礓层是这样坚硬的。他们凭着旺盛的气力，挥动着成万把铁锹、抓钩、钢叉向着砂礓和砂礓层开火；但是结果还没有挖到一指深，全部工具不是断齿就是碰开缺口。为了对付这个强硬的敌人，钻探机随即出动。但是，有的地方钻探机也钻不下去。民工只好采取这种办法：先在砂礓下面掏个大洞，然后用工具从上面往下锤，这样砂礓便脱落下来。但是，即使采取这种办法——而且这种掏洞的办法只能适用于河岸上的砂礓层，不适用于河里的砂礓，工程仍然是十分艰苦的。
    你看见他们在河岸挖砂礓层么？他们爬着或跪着在砂礓层下面一分一寸的挖洞子，手打起泡，泡变成茧，砂粒像钉子似的飞扑脸孔，使人疼痛难受；有时，洞子没有挖好，上面的砂礓层塌下来，把人们的肢体压伤。你看见他们在河里挖砂礓么？冬天，敲破河上的冰，足踏到水里就够冻的难受，然而，有些地方水里的砂礓却像利齿般的刺着足底，他们就是踩在这些“利齿”上面使劲地挖砂礓。当把砂礓挖到一公尺多深的时候，不是足被刺破，就是浑身变成泥人。
    但是，这种艰苦的工程，对于这些久经斗争锻炼的优秀的河工说来，不是什么畏惧，相反地，倒能显出他们的英雄本色。泗县新吴乡民工韩路奇，爬在一块八尺高的砂礓层上面工作，忽然砂礓层倒塌，他随着翻下来，手跌伤了；大家劝他休息，但是他说：“手坏了，不能挖，还能抬土。”于是他便抬起土来了。该乡民工谢立泰，挖砂礓层时，全身给砂土埋掉，大家用手把他挖出来，他喘了几口气，不声不响地又开始工作。佟南乡参加挖河的妇女李葛氏刨砂礓时，大腿被砂地压得负了重伤，她被送到医院后，知道今后不能干这个活儿了，但是她还是积极要求离开医院到工地去。她说：“我不能做重活，烧饭也成。”和她在一块刨砂礓的丈夫李康，当时虽然看见她受伤不轻，心里有些难受，但是，自她进医院后，在三十二天内他才去看过两次。在这些日子里，他默默地完成着他妻子未曾完成的工程。
    在民工这样英勇的和忘我的工作之下，四十公里长的铁石般坚硬的砂礓，逐渐被征服过来了。从工作效率的不断提高可以看出：起先每人每天的效率是○·二公方，后来增至○·六公方，又增至○·八公方，最高的达一公方多。
  忘不了灾难的岁月，向往着美好的将来
    在漫长的濉河线上，这些优秀的民工创造出的勇敢勤劳的事迹是说不完的。他们之所以这样勇敢勤劳，是因为他们忘记不了过去灾难的岁月和向往着美好的将来。
    濉河沿岸的人民，提起国民党时代的治河，都非常痛恨。他们说：“当官的发财，老百姓遭殃。”他们唱着一首这样的歌谣：“提起挖河好心伤，区长盖楼房，乡长盖瓦房，保长砌砖墙，甲长拿头弄尾扣几文，老百姓泪汪汪！”他们看清楚了国民党时代的治河就是欺骗和掠夺。其结果是什么呢？泗县和泗洪县（新设县）一带的民工说得对：“出了钱，出了力，年年扒河（治河），年年受淹！”那受淹的悲惨情景，更是他们永远不会忘怀的：那汪洋的大水，每年要淹掉六七百万亩土地，百余万人民在饥寒线上挣扎。濉河沿岸人民不是歌颂过自己村庄的富庶么：“金大庄，银土山，李七宅子半个天（即有钱遮了半个天），有钱还是简吴家（上四村均属灵璧县）。”但是自连年遭受水灾以来，这些村庄变成什么样子了呢？五年没有收秋，两三年没有收麦，人们吃糠咽菜度日。往日村里牛马成群，现在没有牛马的影子。往日村里树木蓊郁，现在仅有几棵留着水印的小树。做饭没有柴烧，拆掉房子当燃料。房子烧掉不够住，两家合在一家住。“金大庄”已经叫做“光了庄”了。
    是的，濉河沿岸的人民忘记不了过去的灾难。但是，他们也忘记不了人民政府把他们从灾难中挽救出来。解放以来，人民政府连年大力进行生产救灾：发救济粮，发种籽，发冬衣，领导副业生产，进行治河，以工代赈。这样，他们便从灾难中爬起来了。正如灵璧、泗县、泗洪等地的轻、重灾区的人民所说的：“现在吃的，穿的，住的，种的（种籽），用的，毛主席都给咱们操了心，光景有个头绪了”。
    现在他们回想过去的日子，看看现在的时光，心底都满怀着一种新的希望——治好濉河，过好日子。泗县濉南乡的农民说：“只要扒好河，咱这里就是粮食堆子，什么都有。”洪泽湖边的农民说：“咱这个地方能发财，也能饿死人（湖边地好，一亩收三四百斤，等于发财；但常淹，淹了便要饿死人），扒好河，永远发财。”宿县、灵璧一带的农民希望治好河，连收几季好麦，就能盖起房子，增添牲口，娶个媳妇。泗洪县龙集的农民希望治好河，打到粮食，就送儿女上学，再不当几辈子的瞎子。
    濉河沿岸的人民是懂得怎样实现这个美好的将来的。
