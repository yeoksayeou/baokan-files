The Soviet Propaganda Poster and Caricature Exhibition, jointly sponsored by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Fine Arts Workers, and the Central Academy of Fine Arts, has opened in Beijing. From the three hundred and forty-eight works on display, we see the fruitful and nutritious results of the diligent work of Soviet propaganda artists and caricaturists.

Propaganda posters and caricatures, like other Soviet literature and art, have a great influence on progressive Chinese art workers. In the past, due to the reactionary blockade, it was difficult for most people to see Soviet propaganda posters and caricatures. Since the victory of the Chinese revolution, this situation has fundamentally changed, but this is the first time that Soviet propaganda posters and caricatures have been exhibited on such a large scale. It is a very meaningful event for the people of the capital to see these beautiful pictures and to understand Soviet society and Soviet art more closely from these pictures.

Soviet propaganda posters and caricatures are an art that arose in the revolution, and they have a glorious and long history of struggle. The works exhibited this time include early works from 1919 to works from 1950. These propaganda posters and caricatures have a common characteristic: they are very closely combined with the important political struggles of each stage. Whether we look at the works of the painter Moor during the domestic war in 1920, which focused on crushing foreign interventionists and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, or at the paintings on the theme of Soviet economic construction, paintings from the period of the Patriotic War, or paintings reflecting the recovery and development of the Soviet economy after the war, Soviet propaganda posters and caricatures all served the important political struggles of the time. These paintings are full of fighting spirit. Therefore, these paintings still have practical significance for us today. For example, the work "Severely Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries" created by the painter Gini in 1930 is still a painting with an extremely familiar theme for the Chinese people today, twenty years later.

Soviet painters have an extremely broad vision. We certainly cannot say that these propaganda posters represent every aspect of the Soviet state, but we can say that they represent many of the main aspects. For example, the theme of praising leaders Lenin and Stalin, like other Soviet paintings, is largely expressed in propaganda posters. Of the two hundred and thirty-five works exhibited this time, thirty-one are on this theme. There are thirty-five works depicting the heroic Soviet army, and even more works depicting the creative labor of workers. In many paintings, Soviet painters depict how to raise children in the Stalin era, scientific agricultural techniques, how to feed piglets, and how to breed carp. All of this is for the same goal: to move towards a happy communist society and to fight for the beautiful life of the Soviet people and the people of the world.

Many propaganda posters adopt various different themes and express them through artistic images. There are no formulas, no abstract concepts, and no dry sermons, but rather attractive and persuasive artistic images and explanations. For example, Moxin's "Collective Farmers! Build Ponds!" is a beautiful landscape painting. In the pond surrounded by lush green trees, groups of snow-white geese and ducks are swimming. I think anyone who sees this picture will think that they should work hard to build such a beautiful pond.

Another painting is "Strong Man! Grow Up!" by Biliessovsky, depicting a robust Soviet baby being placed on a scale by a nursery worker. This caption fully expresses the future of Soviet children and the care of the Soviet government and people for children.

In the propaganda posters on the theme of defending peace, many use the combination of praising positive characters and satirizing negative characters in the same picture, which is a combination of propaganda posters and caricatures. The difficulty of making positive praise in caricatures is solved. These paintings show how small and fragile those imperialist warmongers are in the face of the powerful forces of the people. This is the creation of Soviet painters, and I think it should also be an artistic expression method that we should learn.

The works of the Soviet caricaturists Kukryniksy, Efimov, Ganf, and other caricaturists who are familiar to us occupy a large place in this venue. Before and during the Patriotic War, a large number of Soviet caricatures focused their firepower on fascist Hitler's Germany. After the war, the painters' pens pointed to the ferocious American imperialism and its accomplices. Although these warmongers are clamoring and making empty threats, in the hands of Soviet painters, they have become a group of weak, outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and declining clowns. Some of the works in the venue satirize American imperialism's enslavement of the British government. Soviet painters have profoundly explored the essence of this theme; Attlee has become a servant of Wall Street, Bevin has become Acheson's seat, and British imperialism, which calls itself a lion, is dragging the American chariot. If it were not for a deep political analysis, then these metaphors would be in vain, and it would be impossible to reveal the essence of the matter.

Soviet painters have adopted familiar life images as metaphors in the expression methods of caricatures. This method is very mature. Precisely because it is an image that comes from life, it is diverse, and therefore it is very easy for the masses to understand. For example, the cartoon "The Marshall Plan in Action" by Kukryniksy uses a horse-drawn cart filled with steamed buns to represent the Marshall Plan. This metaphor accurately expresses the relationship between American imperialism and the enslavement of other countries. Efimov's "America's Business Marriage" uses the image of a wedding ceremony in life to forcibly unite Britain and France with the gold of American imperialism. This very appropriately expresses the relationship between the three.

Another characteristic of Soviet caricatures is that the technique has reached an extremely skilled level. Therefore, it can more perfectly express political content. The image of the characters in the paintings deeply expresses the character and identity of the characters (firstly, due to a deep political analysis), but if the painters had not worked hard in technique, it would not have been possible to achieve this. On this point, when I was in the Soviet Union, I saw Kukryniksy and other painters tirelessly drawing sketches, and I also saw a large cabinet of sketches and drawings by the painter Zhukov, which deeply moved me. In order to more perfectly express political topics, in order to more accurately shoot at the enemy, and in order to more effectively touch and persuade readers through artistic methods, in addition to carefully studying politics, we must also regularly practice our skills. This is an extremely important inspiration for our Chinese caricature workers.

These paintings are so moving that some viewers wrote in the exhibition's opinion book that they hoped to have these paintings printed into a collection of paintings, and many viewers requested that the exhibition be exhibited throughout the country, and in rural areas. A telecommunications worker, Tian Jingzhao, wrote in the opinion book: "I hope that the Central Academy of Fine Arts will set up amateur training classes so that workers can also have the opportunity to learn art." This proves that the Soviet propaganda posters and caricature art exhibited this time have deeply moved our audience. (Attached pictures)

### 苏联的宣传画和讽刺画

　　苏联的宣传画和讽刺画
　　华君武
    中苏友好协会、中华全国美术工作者协会、中央美术学院联合主办的苏联宣传画和讽刺画展览会，已经在北京揭幕了。从三百四十八幅作品中，我们看到了苏联宣传画家和讽刺画家们辛勤工作而结出来的丰硕而有营养的果实。
    宣传画和讽刺画也如苏联其它文学艺术一样，对于中国的进步美术工作者是有极大的影响的。过去由于反动派的封锁，大部分的人对于苏联的宣传画和讽刺画较难看到。自从中国革命胜利以后，这种情况已经有了基本的改变，但是像这样大规模的展出苏联的宣传画和讽刺画，却还是第一次。首都的人民能够看到这些优美的图画，从这些图画里更亲切地了解苏联的社会和苏联的艺术，这是一件非常有意义的事情。
    苏联的宣传画和讽刺画是在革命中兴起的一种艺术，它有着光荣悠久的斗争历史。这次展出的作品中，就有从一九一九年的早期作品，到一九五○年为止的作品。这些宣传画和讽刺画都有一个共同的特点，就是和各个阶段的重要政治斗争，非常紧密地结合着。我们从一九二○年画家莫尔在国内战争时期的作品，粉碎外国干涉者和镇压反革命为内容的画来看也好，从以苏联的经济建设为内容的画，卫国战争时期的画来看也好，从战后反映的苏联经济恢复和发展的画来看也好，苏联的宣传画和讽刺画都是为着当前的重要政治斗争服务的。这些画充满了战斗性。因此，这些画在今天看来，对于我们也还有其现实的意义，举例来说，画家吉尼在一九三○年作的严厉镇压反革命的作品，对于时隔二十年的，今天的中国人民来说，也还是一幅极其亲切的主题的画呢。
    苏联画家们的视野是极其宽广的。我们当然还不能说这些宣传画表现了苏联国家的每个方面，然而可以说表现了许多主要的方面。举例来说，宣传画和其它苏联的绘画一样，歌颂领袖列宁和斯大林同志的主题，在宣传画中是被大量表现着的。这次展出的二百三十五幅作品中，就占有三十一幅。表现英勇的苏联军队的作品就有三十五幅，而表现劳动者创造性的劳动的作品为数更多。在许多画中，苏联画家们画着如何抚育斯大林时代的孩子们，画着科学的农业技术，也画着如何去喂养小猪，如何去繁殖鲤鱼。这一切都是为着同一的目标，走向幸福的共产主义社会，为着苏联人民和世界人民的美好生活而斗争。
    许多宣传画采取了各种不同的主题用艺术的形象表现出来，没有公式，没有抽象的概念，没有枯燥的说教，而是有着吸引人和说服人的艺术形象和说明。举例说，莫辛画的“集体农民们！造池塘吧！”画面上是一幅极美的风景画，被碧绿的树林所围绕的池塘中，成群雪白的鹅鸭在泅水。我想，任何人看了这张画都会想到应当努力工作，去建造这样一个美丽的池塘。
    另一幅是毕列索夫斯基所作的“壮士！成长起来吧！”画着茁壮的苏联婴儿，被保育员放在磅秤上，这句说明，把苏联儿童的未来以及苏联政府和人民对儿童的关怀，充分地表明出来了。
    在保卫和平为主题的宣传画中，有许多是用歌颂正面人物和讽刺反面人物处理在同一画面中，是一种宣传画和讽刺画的结合的形式，讽刺画较难作正面的歌颂的困难被解决了。这种画显示了在强大的人民力量面前，那些帝国主义战争贩子是多么渺小和脆弱。这是苏联画家们的创造，我想也应当是我们要学习的一种艺术表现方法。
    久为我们熟悉的苏联讽刺画家库克磊尼克斯，叶菲莫夫，甘夫及其他讽刺画家们的作品，在这会场里占很大的地位。苏联的讽刺画在卫国战争以前和当时，大量的作品都是集中火力向法西斯的希特勒德国射击，在战争以后，画家们的笔尖就指向了凶恶的美帝国主义及其帮凶们。尽管这些战争贩子们正在叫嚣和虚声恫吓，但它们在苏联画家的笔下，却成为虚弱的，外强中干的，走向没落的一群小丑。会场中有一些作品是讽刺美帝国主义在奴役着英国政府，苏联的画家们极其深刻地发掘了这一主题的本质；艾德礼变成了华尔街的仆役，贝文变成了艾奇逊的坐椅，以狮子自喻的英帝国主义，却在拖着美国的车子。如果不是从政治上去深刻分析，那么这一些比拟也就落空，是不可能揭露事情的本质的。
    苏联画家们在讽刺画的表现方法上，采取了人民所熟悉的生活形象作为比喻，这种方法是非常成熟的。正是由于它是从生活来的的形象，它是多种多样的，因此也就极易为群众所了解，举例来说，库克磊尼克斯所作的《马歇尔计划在实行中》的漫画，用马套包子来表现马歇尔计划，这样的比喻就非常准确地表现了美帝国主义奴役其它国家这一关系。叶菲莫夫所作的《美国的买卖式的婚姻》，利用了生活中的结婚仪式的形象，以美帝国主义的金元，把英国和法国强制地联合在一起了。这就非常恰当地表现了三者的关系。
    苏联讽刺画的另一特点是技术上已经达到了极端熟练的程度。因此就能更完美地去表现政治内容，画中的人物的形象深刻地表现了人物的性格和身份（首先是由于从政治上深刻分析得来的），但如果没有画家们在技术上的苦练，那也是不可能达到的。在这一点上，我在苏联时看到了库克磊尼克斯及其它画家们在孜孜不倦地画着速写，也看到画家儒可夫的一大柜子速写和素描草稿，这是深深使我感动的。为着更完善地表现政治的课题，为了更准确地去射击敌人，为了更能通过艺术的手法去感动和说服读者，除了认真地学习政治，也就必须经常地练习自己的技术，这一点，对于我们中国的讽刺画工作者来说，是一个极其重要的启示。
    这些画是如此地感动人，有的观众在展览会的意见簿上写着，希望把这些画印成画集，许多观众要求画展到全国去展览，到农村中去展览。有一位电信工人田景照在意见簿上写着：“希望中央美术学院设立业余补习班，以便工人也有能学习艺术的机会”，这证明了这次展出的苏联宣传画和讽刺画艺术是深刻地感动了我们的观众。（附图片）
