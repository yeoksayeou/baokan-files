　　Self-Criticism Regarding Delayed Payment of Union Dues

Editor:
　　The article "Taiyuan Yongmao Construction Company Should Allocate Union Funds," published in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on January 12th, criticized us. This criticism is correct.

　　Last year, because we had to pay five months' worth of union dues at once, the amount was large, and the company had temporary financial difficulties, we failed to pay in full promptly, causing comrades from the union to urge us repeatedly. Not only did we not make our best efforts to raise funds for payment, but we also said some unprincipled strange things to the union comrades. This shows that we still lack the idea of relying on the working class. We usually do not study enough, and our policy level is low. Regarding the allocation of union funds, we simply emphasized that we had no money, ignoring that this is a legal responsibility. This was a mistake. Although we made a supplementary payment of union dues on January 4th, we should conduct a deep self-criticism. In the future, in addition to strengthening our studies, we will definitely ensure timely payment of union dues.

### 太原永茂建筑公司  对拖延拨交工会经费的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者来信批评建议的反应

　　太原永茂建筑公司       
    对拖延拨交工会经费的检讨编辑同志：
    一月十二日人民日报“读者来信”栏内刊载“太原永茂建筑公司应拨交工会经费”一文，对我们提出批评。这种批评是正确的。
    去年因我们一下要交五个月的工会经费，数字较大，公司一时款项困难，未能及时缴足，使得工会的同志接二连三地来催交。我们不但未尽最大努力筹款交纳，还向工会的同志讲了一些无原则的怪话。这说明我们还十分缺乏依靠工人阶级的思想。我们平时学习不够，政策水平低，对拨交工会经费，单纯地强调我们没有款，而忽视了这是法律上的责任，这是一个错误。虽然我们已在一月四日补交了工会经费，但应该进行深刻检讨。我们今后除了加强学习外，一定保证按期交纳工会经费。
