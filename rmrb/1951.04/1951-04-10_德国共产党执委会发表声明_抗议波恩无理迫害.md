Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: According to TASS, the Adenauer puppet government recently adopted open terror tactics against various democratic organizations leading the struggle of the West German people, declaring the German Communist Party, the Action Group of the Social Democratic Party, the Free German Youth League, the German Peace Committee, the German-Soviet Friendship Association, the Cultural Alliance, the Democratic Women's League of Germany, the Association of Victims of Nazism, the Pan-German Association of Agricultural and Forestry Workers, and the National Front of Democratic Germany as "unconstitutional" and "anti-national." It also announced that it would no longer provide "government orders and other orders paid for by state funds" to enterprises that provide financial assistance to the aforementioned organizations. The Executive Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement a few days ago, lodging a serious protest against this unreasonable persecution by the Adenauer government.

The statement vehemently condemned the Adenauer government's action, saying it was an attempt to suppress the growing movement against remilitarization and demanding a plebiscite, in accordance with the orders of its foreign masters.

The statement emphasized that neither the Communist Party nor the organizations advocating peace threatened the security of West Germany, but some people were trying to deal with them with extraordinary laws. Peace and security were precisely threatened by the Adenauer government. The West German people strongly opposed remilitarization and hoped to conclude a peace treaty in 1951, which was what Adenauer and his imperialist string-pullers feared. That was why he was violating the constitutional rights of the people.

The German Communist Party solemnly declared in the statement: "In the struggle to defend peace, we will never take a step back. We reiterate what we said in the declaration of the Party Congress: 'In order to defend peace and save the country, the German Communist Party will spare no sacrifice if necessary. This path is in line with the peaceful interests of our people, therefore this path is just and will lead to victory.'"

　　德国共产党执委会发表声明
　  抗议波恩无理迫害
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：阿登纳傀儡政府最近对领导西德人民作斗争的各民主组织采取了公开的恐怖行动，宣布德国共产党与社会民主党行动派、自由德国青年联盟、德国和平委员会、德苏友好协会、文化联盟、德国民主妇女联合会、纳粹受害者协会、全德农林工作者协会及民主德国全国阵线等团体为“违反宪法”、“仇视国家”，并宣布今后将不把“政府定货单以及由国家经费开支的其他定货单”交与给上列各组织以经济援助的各企业。对于阿登纳政府这一无理迫害，德国共产党执行委员会已于日前发表声明，提出严重抗议。
    声明痛斥阿登纳政府这样做，是企图遵照其外国主子的命令，镇压日益增长的反对重新军国主义化与要求举行人民投票的运动。
    声明强调指出：不论是共产党，还是主张和平的团体，都没有威胁西德的安全，但是，却有人企图用非常的法律来处置它们。和平与安全正是受到了阿登纳政府的威胁。西德人民都强烈地反对重新军国主义化并希望在一九五一年缔结和约，这就是阿登纳及其牵线人帝国主义者所害怕的事情。这就是他所以要侵犯人民的宪法权利的原因。
    德国共产党在声明中庄严地宣布：“在维护和平的斗争中，我们决不退后一步。我们重申我们在党代表大会宣言中已经说过的话：‘为了维护和平与拯救国家，德国共产党在必要时将不惜任何牺牲。这条道路是符合我国人民的和平利益的，因此这条道路是正义的，并且会通向胜利。’”
