The issue of student health has generally attracted the attention of educational administrative departments and school leaders in various regions. Schools are currently considering adjusting the curriculum, streamlining unnecessary teaching materials, improving teaching methods, and enhancing students' learning outcomes. At the same time, they are appropriately reducing meetings and activities to ensure students get adequate sleep and necessary extracurricular activity time. Many schools have added hygiene and sports equipment, and have jointly formed health committees, sports and hygiene committees, etc., comprised of school administration, student unions, and physiology and physical education teachers, in order to promote this work in an organized and planned manner.

Currently, schools in various regions are making full use of extracurricular activity time. Some schools have even established extracurricular activity committees to lead students in activities such as dancing, drama, group games, ball games, and waist drum performances. Some schools also use holidays and festivals to organize students for outings, mountain climbing, or entertainment evenings. For example, over 80% of students at Peking University participate in morning exercises and extracurricular activities. At Tsinghua University, the number of students participating in morning runs has increased from a few dozen to over 500.

Schools are also paying attention to improving students' meals. In the past, due to poor meals, more than half of the students at Shenyang Advanced Industrial Vocational School suffered from night blindness and dry eye. However, after efforts were made to improve the situation, many students gained weight, and the number of illnesses decreased, completely eliminating night blindness and dry eye. Universities such as Zhejiang University and Tsinghua University have also improved dining hall work according to their specific circumstances.

Some schools use the surplus from extracurricular production to subsidize food expenses. The production committee of Guangzhou Municipal Normal School organized a production cooperative to raise livestock and grow vegetables. Beijing Municipal No. 1 Middle School challenged other middle schools in the city: guaranteeing that all 800 teachers, students, and staff members have vegetables to eat in all four seasons, with an average of at least half a jin of green vegetables per person per day, and at least 400 people drinking a bowl of soy milk every day.

In order to ensure that students with lung diseases can receive isolated recuperation, more than 70 students with lung diseases at Nanjing University organized a Lung Disease Student Affairs Committee to manage their own welfare affairs, such as meals, hygiene, and recreation. Students with financial difficulties can also receive assistance from the school.

To ensure school hygiene, the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau is planning to jointly organize a city-wide hygiene committee with the Health Bureau to promote school hygiene work; and plans to establish school hygiene stations in districts to be responsible for student diagnosis, prevention, and physical examinations for each school. The China Medical University has also decided to provide 100 half-price treatments to middle school students in the city every day. The Shenyang Student Union has also implemented a method of providing free or reduced-fee referrals for treatment for poor students. In addition, Peking University and Songjiang Mudanjiang Normal School and other schools have regularly published wall newspapers to introduce general health and medical knowledge to increase students' hygiene knowledge.

　　各地学校开始注意学生健康
    学生健康问题，已普遍引起各地教育行政部门、学校领导方面的重视。各地学校现正在考虑调整课程，精简不必要的教材，改进教学方法，提高学生学习效果；同时，适当地减少会议活动，使学生获得足够的睡眠和必需的课外活动时间。许多学校添置了卫生体育设备，并由学校行政、学生会及生理、体育教员等共同组成了健康委员会、体育卫生委员会等，以便有组织、有计划地推进这一工作。
    目前，各地学校都充分利用了课外活动时间，部分学校还专门成立了课外活动委员会，领导同学进行舞蹈、戏剧、集体游戏、球类、腰鼓等活动，有些学校更利用假期及节日，组织同学郊游、爬山或举行文娱晚会等。例如北京大学参加早操和课外活动的人数已达百分之八十以上。清华大学每天早晨参加长跑的学生已由原来的几十个人增加到五百余人。
    学生的伙食，各校也在注意改进。沈阳工科高级职业学校过去由于伙食不好，曾有半数以上学生患夜盲症和眼干症。但经过设法改善以后，很多学生的体重都增加，生病的也减少了，并完全消灭了夜盲症和眼干症。浙江、清华等大学也根据具体情况改善了膳团工作。
    有些学校以课余生产的盈余，补助伙食费。广州市立师范生产委员会组织了生产合作社饲养牲畜和种植蔬菜。北京市立第一中学向全市其他中学提出挑战：保证全校师生员工八百人四季有菜吃，平均每人每天至少能吃到半斤青菜，并起码有四百人每天喝到一碗豆浆。
    为了使肺病同学能得到隔离休养，南京大学七十多位患肺病的同学组织了肺病同学干事会，来管理他们自己的福利事业，如膳食、卫生、文娱等工作。经济困难的同学，还可以得到学校的帮助。
    在保证学校卫生方面，天津市教育局正拟与卫生局共同组织全市性的卫生委员会，推动学校的卫生工作；并拟分区设立学校卫生站，负责办理各校学生诊疗、预防和身体检查等工作。中国医科大学还决定每日给全市中学生以一百名半价治疗的便利；沈阳市学生联合会也施行了对贫苦学生免、减费介绍治疗的办法。此外，北京大学及松江牡丹江师范等校为了增进同学们的卫生常识，定期出版了壁报，专门介绍一般卫生医疗常识。
