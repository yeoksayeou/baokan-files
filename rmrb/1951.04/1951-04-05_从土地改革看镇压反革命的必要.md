Seeing the Necessity of Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries from the Land Reform
	Assistant Teacher, Engineering Department, North China University, Xue Shouzhang

	In early February this year, I had the opportunity to join the "Northwest Land Reform Visiting Group" to visit the land reform in the Wuxing District of Chang'an County, Guanzhong, Northwest China. In this earth-shattering land reform movement, we witnessed the power of the peasants; saw how the cadres correctly implemented the government's policies; and understood why, when implementing land reform, it is necessary to boldly mobilize the masses to launch a fierce struggle against the landlord class, and not to peacefully distribute land or simply distribute land, etc. We returned to Beijing on March 15th, just in time for the Beijing People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee meeting to discuss the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries." The representatives unanimously demanded the resolute suppression of counter-revolutionary activities. I think this is something that completely represents the interests and demands of the people, and is something that everyone cares about. Now, based on the facts I have witnessed, heard, and personally experienced during the land reform visit, I will talk about why it is necessary to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries.

		The More Lenient, the More Ferocious

	When in Chang'an County, we first visited Sippo Village, which had just undergone land reform. Among the thirteen landlord households in this village, not a single one had not committed a crime during the land reform process. One of the landlords, named Zhao Weiyi, was once the secretary-general of the Kuomintang Chang'an County. He had been under government supervision and training for eight months after liberation, but he remained incorrigible after being released. He instigated thugs to violently strike the head and waist of Zhao Ke, the director of the peasant association, with stones in the night, knocking Zhao Ke unconscious. Fortunately, he was rescued by the militia patrolling at night. After this assassination attempt, the government did not deal with it in a timely manner, but only asked him to write a letter of repentance. Although Zhao Weiyi superficially admitted his mistake and expressed his submission to the peasants, he secretly continued to undermine land reform. He spread rumors saying: "Land reform is divided into three stages: first reform the landlords, then the rich peasants, and third the middle peasants." When he saw that the peasant association was organizing the militia, he spread another rumor: "The Third World War is about to break out, and they are going to conscript!" When assessing his class status, he bought off a group of people, asking them to prove that he had "major labor," in an attempt to lower his class status. However, the villagers saw clearly and questioned him: "You were the puppet secretary-general, riding in a truck, going back and forth with a whoosh, what major labor did you do?" He also colluded with a group of bad elements to put on a rival show against the peasant association: the peasant association held a meeting, and they held a secret meeting, for a total of seven times. Because of his various acts of sabotage, the peasants launched five struggles of reasoning against him. Although he tried his best to quibble, he was speechless in the face of conclusive evidence and had to remain silent in the end. Thus, he wrote three more letters of repentance. The masses reported that his family had a pistol, but he insisted that he did not and refused to hand it over voluntarily.

	Eight months of supervision and training, five struggles of reasoning, and three letters of repentance, did Zhao Weiyi really submit to the peasants? Did he stop undermining land reform? Facts proved that the leniency of the peasants towards him did not prompt him to repent and reform, but made him even more rampant. Zhao Weiyi had no intention of repenting at all, and not only continued to undermine land reform, but also undermined it more fiercely. He even planned to assassinate the village chief and the director and deputy directors of the peasant association. Fortunately, the peasant association cadres had raised their vigilance and arrested them on the spot on the night they held a secret meeting to decide on the conspiracy. After the arrest, a pistol was also found. This shows that counter-revolutionaries will never willingly be eliminated. Leniency towards these people only makes them more rampant and unscrupulous.

		The Enemy Will Not Voluntarily Surrender Their Arms

	Later we went to Dongda Village, Eleventh Township, Wuxing District. The landlord Zhang Zhijing in this village was known as the "King of Hexi." During the Kuomintang rule, he served as a member of the Chang'an County Council. His father's generation had six brothers, known as the "Six Wolves." His younger brother, named Zhang Zhiming, was nicknamed "Pangolin." They were all despotic landlords. His family had privately set up a criminal court and hired a dozen thugs. He often said: "You can't become a rich man without killing poor people!" He called himself the "Living閻王" in front of the peasants, "If I want you to die, you die, and if I want you to live, you live." Anyone who dared to disobey him would be arrested and made to sit on the "airplane" (a torture method), kneeling on red iron chains. The peasants were forced into bankruptcy, selling their children, hanging themselves, and jumping into the river. No one knows how many died tragically.

	After liberation, the reactionary arrogance of the Zhang Zhijing and Zhang Zhiming brothers was still very high, and they continued to be enemies of the people. Zhang Zhijing once colluded with Zhang Fu and five others to go to Nanshan to "fight guerrillas." He said to Zhang Fu: "As long as there are people, guns are no problem." At that time, Zhang Fu did not fall for it and announced this conspiracy in public. Later, when Zhang Fu became the director of the township peasant association, Zhang Zhiming took 1.5 dan of grain to bribe him. Zhang Zhijing hosted a banquet to invite village cadres, attempting to buy them off and win them over. At the same time, he secretly transferred a large amount of grain and property and dispersed the land. Not only that, but they also instigated backward elements in the armed forces to carry out a rebellion. In the autumn of 1949, a certain platoon of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army was producing in Xida Village (adjacent to Dongda Village). Zhang Zhijing used his lackey Zhang Zigui to collude with some backward liberation fighters in the unit, inciting them to rebel. Although this conspiracy rebellion case was uncovered by the government, it was not dealt with in a timely manner, and the guns were not recovered (according to the masses, his family had a light machine gun, eight rifles, five pistols, more than thirty grenades, and a large box of bullets. Except for one rifle and one pistol handed over in the early days of liberation, the rest were not handed over). After the land reform began, the masses were initially mobilized. From Guo Suiwa, a long-term worker in his family, it was learned that a rifle was buried in the soil under a haystack in the south courtyard of the Zhang family. When Zhang Zhiming was asked about it at the time, he denied it to the death. Later, when he was asked to sign a certificate, he wrote: "My family has no guns. If they are found, I will be executed without regret." The next morning, a mass meeting of the whole village was held, and he was asked to confess in front of the masses, but he still said no. On the spot, the masses inspected his home and dug out a rifle under the haystack. With the gun in front of him, Zhang Zhiming still wanted to quibble, saying that the gun was broken. At that time, the villagers asked him to hand over all the weapons, and he said: "There really aren't any now. If any more are found, I will really be 'executed without regret'." However, at noon on the same day, two grenades were dug out from the soil under a haystack in the north courtyard of his house. I obtained the clues for these two grenades in a conversation with Li Bailou (Zhang Zhiming's nephew, who is an intellectual) after the meeting, and then got them from Zhang Zhiming's son. These two grenades were very new, with no rust on the iron, proving that they had been buried in the past few days. Zhang Zhijing's son buried the grenades. He originally lived in Xi'an and had returned twice after the land reform began. After that, the masses dug out many bullets from his house. Zhang Zhijing also initially denied all these weapons, but later, when he knew that they had been dug out by the masses, he did not dare to deny it. However, he still refused to hand over the light machine gun, pistol, and other weapons. These counter-revolutionaries will never voluntarily surrender their arms to the people. If you are lenient towards them, they will try every possible means to deal with you to the end,妄想 (wang xiang - absurdly hope) that one day they will ride on the heads of the people again!

	Secondly, I would like to use the facts in the land reform to illustrate the relationship between the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the land reform.

		Without Resolutely Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries, the Masses Cannot Be Mobilized

	The local tyrant Lu Shitai in Yanwan Village, Fourth Township, Baqiao District, Chang'an County, nicknamed "Zuoshanwang" (King of the Mountain), colluded with enemy and puppet troops before liberation, killing, robbing, raping women, and committing all kinds of evil. When women in Yanwan Village encountered a crying child, they only had to say "Look! Lu Xiawa (Lu Shitai's nickname)," and the child would not dare to cry anymore. Even children could count several of the bad things he had done, and the peasants hated him to the bone. After liberation, more than 30 peasants, including Luo Changde, organized a peasant association to reason with him, and finally押到 (ya dao - escorted) him to the district. However, the district cadres at that time had an boundless tendency towards leniency, and did not punish him severely, but released him on bail. Lu Shitai returned to the village and said to the peasants: "You bunch of poor kids, I have crossed great rivers and seas, and now I am suffering from your small mosquito bites? Go! Take your legs if you want them, take your arms if you want them!" When the villagers heard that Lu Shitai had been released again, they stopped hoeing the fields. The elderly people who participated in the reasoning meeting told the young people: "You with strong legs should leave quickly! We old men are waiting to be shot." After the district government learned of this situation, it arrested Lu Shitai again and sent him to the county people's court, which sentenced him to three years in prison. When the news reached Baqiao, everyone felt that it was still too lenient towards him. The peasant Luo Changde said: "People are saying that the government is implementing a policy of leniency. The people are very panicked! Sitting in prison won't hurt a hair on his head, and three years will be over in a blink of an eye. There are many people sighing, and no one is in the mood to produce." While in prison, Lu犯 (Lu fan - criminal Lu) even took the opportunity of meeting with his family to instruct his wife to transfer land and property and resist land reform. He also made a big statement: "When I am released in three years, I will fill the village with spirit halls and tables, from the top of the ditch to the bottom." He also incited his younger brother Lu Yunshan to return to the village to spread rumors, threaten the masses, resist the payment of public grain, and undermine government decrees. Lu Yunshan also colluded with habitual bandits, looting everywhere, and people were even more panicked.

	The above facts show that if counter-revolutionaries are not dealt with in a timely manner or are treated too leniently, they cannot be made to bow their heads and confess their crimes. Even in prison, they will still transfer land and property, resist land reform, and threaten the masses. And the peasants are "sighing", "very panicked", "not in the mood to produce", "those with strong legs want to escape", and "old men are waiting to be shot". Can land reform proceed smoothly in this way? Do the peasants dare to divide the land? Even if the land is divided, can the peasants be at ease to produce? Isn't the reason very obvious? To successfully complete land reform, it is necessary to severely suppress counter-revolutionaries; otherwise, the peasants will have many concerns and will not dare to rise up. Take the land reform in Dongda Village, for example. Before the guns of Zhang Zhijing and Zhang Zhiming were dug out, the peasants did not dare to speak. Even after the first gun was dug out, the peasants still had many concerns. At that time, a militiaman guarding Zhang Zhiming secretly approached the work team to talk: "The back door of my house is not strong. I am afraid of something happening at night..." He was afraid that Zhang Zhiming would assassinate him. Only after the two despots Zhang Zhijing and Zhang Zhiming were arrested and a struggle meeting of more than 20,000 people was held did the knot in the hearts of the peasants untie, and they dared to rise up and carry out land reform. Take the land reform in Baqiao District, for example. After the land reform work team understood the ideological situation of the masses, the Chang'an County People's Court accepted the peasants' demands and corrected the tendency of "unlimited leniency." With the approval of the higher authorities, according to the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," Lu Shitai was sentenced to death and executed by shooting after the struggle meeting. The people were overjoyed, and the applause was thunderous. More than 100,000 people in the field shouted: "Well done, right! By removing this scourge, we peasants can concentrate on land reform!"

	If counter-revolutionaries are not resolutely suppressed, on the one hand, the peasants will not dare to rise up, and land reform cannot be carried out; on the other hand, it may also cause chaos in the land reform order and lead to "leftist" tendencies. Because the peasants' grievances cannot be redressed, and the government has failed to suppress the counter-revolutionaries for them, they will have to rise up themselves and take action to eliminate the harm. Once the suppressed emotions are vented, it is not easy to control. Take the land reform in Dongda Village, for example. At the beginning of the land reform, some peasants said to the work team: "It is not enough to just talk and not do, or just struggle and not deal with it." Some peasants also discussed privately that they wanted to bury Zhang Zhijing and Zhang Zhiming alive without going through the people's court. They did not believe in the people's court, or even in the government's laws. They were afraid that the government would be lenient again. After the struggle meeting of more than 20,000 people on March 7, the masses demanded that the people's court pronounce a verdict on the spot. The staff of the people's court said: "We will study the materials reflected by everyone and deal with it soon." But the masses still did not disperse, fearing that the people's court would sentence them too lightly. Some people on the spot advocated immediately chopping Zhang Zhijing and Zhang Zhiming to death; others advocated piercing them with鏢槍 (biao qiang - dart spears). After the cadres repeatedly explained: "The people's court is the court of the people, and it will definitely work for the people and make judgments according to everyone's opinions and in accordance with the law," they also sent cadres and activists down to explain repeatedly to the peasants in each village, and the masses reluctantly dispersed.

	From the above facts, it shows that in order to ensure the orderly progress of land reform, it is necessary to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries!

　　从土地改革看镇压反革命的必要
    华北大学工学院助教  薛寿漳
    今年二月初，我得有机会作为“西北土改参观团”的一员，到西北关中长安县五星区一带参观土地改革。在这个惊天动地的土地改革运动中，我们亲眼看到了农民的力量；看到了干部是如何正确地贯彻政府的政策；认识了为什么实行土地改革时，必须放手发动群众向地主阶级展开激烈的斗争，而不能和平分地与单纯分地等等。我们于三月十五日回到北京，正逢北京市人民代表会议协商委员会开会，讨论“惩治反革命条例”。代表们一致要求坚决镇压反革命活动。我想这是一件完全代表人民利益与要求，是大家所关心的事情。今就个人在参观土地改革中目睹耳闻及亲身经历的事实，谈谈为什么要坚决镇压反革命。
            愈宽大，它愈凶狠
    在长安县时，我们首先访问了初经土地改革的寺坡村。这村共十三户地主，在土地改革过程中，竟没有一户没犯过法。其中一个地主，名叫赵维镒，当过国民党长安县书记长，解放以后被政府管训过八个月，但放出来后仍怙恶不悛。他曾唆使暴徒在夜里用石头猛击农会主任赵珂的头部与腰部，打得赵珂昏迷不醒。幸而碰到民兵巡夜，才得救。这件刺杀事件发生后，政府并未及时地处理，仅仅只要他写悔过书。赵维镒虽然表面上认了错，表示向农民低头，但暗中照旧破坏土地改革。他造谣说：“土地改革分三次：先改地主，次改富农，三改中农。”他见农会组织民兵，又放出谣言：“第三次大战打起来了，要拉壮丁了。”在评定成份时，他收买了一批人，要这些人证明他有“主要劳动”，企图降低成份。但是，老乡们看得清楚，指问他：“你当伪书记长，坐着卡车，来去呜呜的，有啥主要劳动？”他又勾引了一批坏分子，与农会唱对台戏：农会开一次会，他们也开一次秘密会，一共开了七次。由于他这样地百般破坏，农民曾向他展开五次说理斗争。虽然他千方百计地狡赖，但是在确凿的人证物证前面，词穷理拙，最后不得不闭口无言。这样，他又先后写了三次悔过书。群众反应他家有手枪，但他一口咬定说没有，不肯自动交出来。
    八个月的管训，五次说理斗争，三次悔过，赵维镒是不是真的向农民低头了呢？他是不是不再破坏土地改革了呢？事实证明，农民对他的宽大，不但没有促使他悔过自新，反而使得他更加猖獗了。赵维镒丝毫没有悔过之心，不但继续破坏土地改革，而且破坏得更加激烈了，他竟计划将村长与正、副农会主任统统暗杀掉。幸亏农会干部已提高警惕，就在他们开秘密会决定阴谋计划的那天晚上，当场将他们逮捕了。逮捕以后，还搜出一支手枪。由此可见，反革命分子决不自甘消灭。对这些人的宽大，结果是使得他们更猖獗，更肆无忌惮。
            敌人不会自动缴械
    后来我们到了五星区十一乡东大村。这村地主张志敬，人称“河西王”。国民党统治时期，他当长安县参议员。他父辈弟兄六个，人称“六只狼”。他的弟弟名叫张志明，外号“穿山甲”。都是恶霸地主。他家里曾私设刑庭，雇了十几个打手。他常说：“杀不了穷汉，成不了富汉！”在农民面前自称“活阎王”，“要你死就死，活就活。”谁敢违抗他，便抓来坐“飞机”，跪红铁索。农民被逼得家破人亡，卖儿鬻女，上吊跳滩，死于非命的不知有多少。
    解放以后，张志敬、张志明弟兄俩的反动气焰依然很高，继续与人民为敌。张志敬曾勾引张福等五人上南山“打游击”，他对张福说：“只要有人，枪没有问题。”当时张福没有上当，把这阴谋当众宣布了。后来张福当了乡农会主任，张志明拿一石五斗粮去行贿。张志敬摆酒席请村干部，企图收买拉拢干部，同时又暗中转移大批粮食、财物，分散土地。不但如此，他们还策动武装部队中的落后分子进行叛变。一九四九年秋，解放军某团某排在西大村（东大村相邻）生产，张志敬利用狗腿子张子贵，勾引该部一部分落后的解放战士，煽惑落后分子，进行叛变。这一阴谋叛变案虽经政府破获，但没有及时处理，枪枝也没有追出来（据群众反映，他家里有轻机关枪一挺，步枪八支，手枪五支，手榴弹三十余枚，子弹一大箱，除解放初期交出一支步枪，一支手枪之外，余均未交出）。土地改革开始以后，初步发动了群众，从他家长工郭遂娃口中，知道在张家南院草堆下面土中埋有步枪一支。当时找张志明查问，他却死不承认。后来要他具结，他写道：“我家无枪，如经查出，枪决无悔。”第二天早晨，开全村群众大会，在群众面前要他坦白，他还说没有。当场即由群众到他家中检查，就在那个草堆下面挖出了步枪一支。枪摆在面前，张志明还想狡辩，说这枪是坏的。当时老乡们要他把所有武器都交出来，他说：“现在真的没有了，再查出来真的‘枪决无悔’了。”但是，就在当天中午，又在他家北院草堆下面土中，挖出两个手榴弹来。这两个手榴弹是我在会后与李白楼（张志明的外甥，是知识分子）谈出线索后，再从张志明的儿子手中搞出来的。这二颗手榴弹样式很新，弹铁上毫无锈痕，证明是最近几天才埋下的。埋手榴弹的是张志敬的儿子。他原来住在西安，土地改革开始后还回来过两次。此后群众又从他家搞出许多子弹。所有这些武器，张志敬最初也不承认，后来知道已被群众搞出来了，才不敢抵赖了。但是，轻机关枪、手枪及其他武器还是不肯交出来。这些反革命分子，他决不会自动向人民缴械。你对他宽大，他却要想尽一切可能的办法与你周旋到底，妄想有一天再骑在人民头上！
    其次，我想再以土地改革中的事实来说明镇压反革命与土地改革的关系。
            不坚决镇压反革命，就不能发动群众
    长安县灞桥区四乡砚湾村恶霸鹿世泰，外号“坐山王”，解放前勾结敌伪团队，杀人抢劫、奸淫妇女，无恶不作。砚湾村妇女遇到孩子哭，只要说上一句“看！鹿瞎娃（鹿世泰的小名）”，孩子就不敢再哭了。他做的坏事，连娃娃们也能数上几宗，农民恨他入骨。解放后，农民罗昌德等三十多人组织农会，与他进行说理斗争，最后把他押到区上。但当时区干部有着宽大无边的偏向，没有严厉惩办，就让他取保释放了。鹿世泰回到村里，对农民说：“你们这伙穷小子，我大江大海都渡过，现在受你们这股小蚊子气？走！要腿给腿，要胳膊给胳膊！”全村人听说鹿世泰又放回来，地也不锄了，参加说理斗争会的老年人给年青人们说：“你们腿硬的快走吧！我们老汉们等着挨枪打就是了。”区政府知道这情形后，又把鹿世泰押起来，送到县人民法庭，判了三年徒刑。消息传到灞桥，人人都觉得还是对他太宽大。农民罗昌德说：“人家都说政府实行宽大政策哩。人民心里都慌得很哪！坐狱，连人家的毛也伤不着一根，三年一幌就满了，唉声叹气的人多着呢，反正都无心生产了。”鹿犯在狱中还乘接见家属机会，指使他妻子转移土地与财产，抗拒土地改革。他又放出大话：“三年一满，我要村里灵堂灵桌子支满，从沟上支到沟下。”还唆使他弟弟鹿云山回村造谣，威胁群众，抗缴公粮，破坏政府法令。鹿云山又勾结惯匪，到处抢劫，人心更慌了。
    上面事实中说明了，如果对反革命分子不及时处理或处理得过宽，就不能使反革命分子低头服罪。他在狱中也还要转移土地财物，抗拒土地改革；还要威吓群众。而农民呢，“唉声叹气”，“心慌得很”，“无心生产”，“腿硬的要逃跑”，“老汉等着挨枪打”。这样土地改革能够顺利进行吗？农民敢分地吗？即使分了地，农民能安心生产吗？道理不是很明显吗？要胜利地完成土地改革，必须严厉镇压反革命，否则农民就顾虑很多，不敢起来。就拿东大村的土地改革来说，也是这样。当张志敬、张志明两人的枪还没有搞出来之前，农民便不敢说话。就在第一支枪搞出来以后，农民还有很多顾虑。当时一个看守张志明的民兵偷偷地找工作组来谈：“咱家后门不牢固，夜里怕万一……”他恐怕张志明来暗害他。只有当张志敬张志明两个恶霸被逮捕起来，并且开了二万多人的斗争会以后，农民心中的疙瘩才解开了，才敢起来进行土地改革。再拿灞桥区的土地改革来说，土地改革工作组了解群众的思想情况后，长安县人民法庭便接受了农民的要求，纠正了“宽大无边”的偏向，经上级批准，按“惩治反革命条例”，把鹿世泰在斗争会后判处死刑，执行枪决，人心大快，掌声如雷，满场子十来万人高呼：“杀得好，杀得对，除了这个祸根，我们农民一心闹土地改革！”
    如不坚决镇压反革命，一方面农民不敢起来，土地改革进行不了；另一方面，也可能会使土地改革秩序混乱，发生过“左”的倾向。因为农民满肚子冤屈不得申诉，政府又未能替他们镇压反革命，他们便要自己起来，动手除害。当被抑制的情绪一旦发泄出来，那是不容易掌握的。再拿东大村的土地改革来说，在土地改革开始时，有的农民对工作组说：“光说不做，光斗争不处理是不成的。”也有些农民私下议论，想不经过人民法庭而把张志敬、张志明两人活埋掉。他们不相信人民法庭，甚至不相信政府法律。他们害怕政府再讲宽大。在三月七日二万多人参加的斗争会后，群众要求人民法庭当场判决。人民法庭的工作人员说：“我们根据大家反映的材料，研究以后，很快就处理。”但是群众还是不散，他们唯恐人民法庭判得太轻了。当场有人主张立刻铡死张志敬与张志明；也有主张用镖枪刺死的。经过干部再三解释：“人民法庭是人民的法庭，是一定替人民办事，一定根据大家意见，依法判决”。这样解释了一个多小时，又派干部与积极分子下去分头与各村农民反复解释，群众才勉强地散去。
    从以上事实中，说明为了要保证土地改革有秩序地进行，必须坚决镇压反革命！
