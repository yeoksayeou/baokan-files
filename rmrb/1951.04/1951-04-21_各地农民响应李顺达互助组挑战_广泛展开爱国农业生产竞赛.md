Farmers Across the Country Respond to Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team's Challenge
Widely Launching Patriotic Agricultural Production Competition

　　An unprecedented patriotic production competition movement on China's agricultural production front has been widely launched throughout the country. This patriotic production competition was proposed on March 6th by the famous agricultural labor model Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team of Shanxi Province, and it has been warmly responded to by agricultural labor models and mutual aid teams across the country. The leading organs in various places also attach great importance to this movement. After the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team issued a production challenge to farmers across the country, the agricultural departments of the People's Governments of Jilin, Songjiang, Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, Gansu, Qinghai, Shandong, Zhejiang, Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Northern Sichuan and other provinces and districts issued instructions calling on all labor models to respond to the challenge of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team. Hui Zhongquan, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, also wrote a letter to all agricultural labor models in the Northwest, hoping that they would formulate production plans based on the different conditions in each place to respond to the challenge of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team and launch a region-wide production competition. The Northeast People's Government also promulgated "Reward Measures for Patriotic Agricultural Bumper Harvest Movement". As a result, the patriotic production movement has gained rapid development throughout the country. As of the 16th of this month, labor models and mutual aid teams from twenty-nine provinces and districts including Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, Pingyuan, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaodong, Rehe, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Jiangxi, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, Northern Anhui, Guizhou, Southern Sichuan, Northern Sichuan and Western Sichuan have responded to the challenge of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, including 1,938 mutual aid teams and 1,618 labor models. Most of the responding labor models in various provinces and regions, while responding to the challenge of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, also challenged the farmers in their own provinces and regions, forming a heated "chain competition". For example, the Zhao Qizhi Mutual Aid Team in the Northeast region, after responding to the challenge of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, challenged all cotton farmers in the Northeast region with the slogan "One more cotton boll per plant"; the Xu Niuwa Mutual Aid Team in Henan Province and the Chen Weifang Mutual Aid Team in Northern Jiangsu Province, after responding to the challenge of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, also proposed to challenge the labor models and mutual aid teams in the entire province and region. At the same time, under the influence of the production competition initiated by the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, the bumper harvest competition between mutual aid teams and between farmers became even more heated. According to statistics from Hebei Province at the end of March, more than 300,000 mutual aid teams in the province, led by tens of thousands of labor models, have launched a bumper harvest competition movement; in the Northeast region, more than 500 mutual aid teams and tens of thousands of farmers have been involved in the bumper harvest competition craze.
    The rapid development of this patriotic production movement fully demonstrates the unprecedented high level of production enthusiasm of the broad masses of Chinese farmers under the education of the patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea campaign. When this movement began, many labor models and mutual aid teams automatically convened family meetings and mutual aid team meetings, conscientiously formulated annual production plans, and enthusiastically participated in the competition. From the production competition plans proposed by labor models and mutual aid teams across the country, most have the following characteristics:
    (1) Emphasis on improving agricultural technology. The response plans of many mutual aid teams focus on intensive cultivation, increased fertilization, water management and pest control, and enriching the new content of mutual aid teams as the main conditions. For example, the Han En Mutual Aid Team in Jilin Province proposed to connect with supply and marketing cooperatives to ensure the promotion of local products and the supply of production materials, and many responding mutual aid teams in the old revolutionary areas of northern Shaanxi proposed to establish agricultural research groups to improve agricultural technology, which are all good examples.
    (2) Emphasis on inspection and summary. The responding labor models and mutual aid teams in various places not only formulated specific production increase plans in their response letters, but also formulated guarantee conditions for inspection and implementation of the plans. For example, Shi Cunjin and 298 other labor models in Licheng County, Shanxi Province, hired 15 responsible cadres from the special district and county to organize an evaluation committee to inspect the implementation of the response plan and prepare for a final evaluation in the autumn of this year. The Wang Zhentang Mutual Aid Team in Heilongjiang Province stipulates that a meeting of persons in charge of various industries (his team implements division of labor and industries according to each person's expertise) is held every seven days to check the completion of the response plan, and an inspection and summary is carried out in each agricultural season. These are effective ways to ensure the completion of the competition plan.
    (3) Seize the agricultural season and conduct evaluations. For example, the Lü Hongbin Mutual Aid Team in Shandong Province has already evaluated cultivation methods during this year's spring plowing. Through this evaluation, all team members further recognized the importance of improved cultivation methods for ensuring increased grain production this year.
    Now, spring plowing has begun in various parts of the country, and the leading organs in various places are seizing this season to help the responding labor models and mutual aid teams implement their response plans and complete the spring plowing and sowing tasks.

### 各地农民响应李顺达互助组挑战  广泛展开爱国农业生产竞赛

　　各地农民响应李顺达互助组挑战
    广泛展开爱国农业生产竞赛
    在我国农业生产战线上具有空前规模的爱国主义生产竞赛运动，已在全国范围内广泛地开展起来。这一爱国生产竞赛是今年三月六日由山西省著名农业劳动模范李顺达互助组所提出的，它获得了全国各地农业劳动模范和互助组的热烈响应。各地领导机关对这个运动也极为重视。当李顺达互助组向全国农民提出生产挑战后，吉林、松江、河北、山西、察哈尔、甘肃、青海、山东、浙江、苏北、皖北、川北等省、区人民政府的农业部门均发出指示，号召全体劳动模范向李顺达互助组应战。西北军政委员会农林部部长惠中权并写信给西北全体农业劳动模范，希望他们根据各地不同条件，订出生产计划向李顺达互助组应战和开展全区性的生产竞赛。东北人民政府也颁布了“爱国主义农业丰产运动奖励办法”。因而，爱国生产运动在全国范围内获得了迅速的发展。截至本月十六日为止，全国已有山西、河北、察哈尔、平原、内蒙自治区、松江、黑龙江、吉林、辽东、热河、陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海、江西、河南、湖南、湖北、广东、浙江、福建、山东、苏北、皖南、皖北、贵州、川南、川北、川西等二十九个省、区的劳动模范和互助组向李顺达互助组应战，应战者包括一千九百三十八个互助组，和一千六百一十八位劳动模范。其中大部分省、区的应战劳动模范在向李顺达互助组应战同时，又向本省、本区的农民挑战，形成了热烈的“连环竞赛”。如东北区赵启志互助组在向李顺达互助组应战后，以“每棵多结一个棉桃”的口号向东北全区棉农挑战；河南省许牛娃互助组和苏北区陈维芳互助组向李顺达互助组应战后，又提出向全省全区劳动模范和互助组挑战。同时，在李顺达互助组发起生产竞赛的影响下、各地互助组与互助组和农民与农民之间的丰产竞赛更为热烈。据河北省三月底的统计，全省已有三十余万个互助组在上万劳动模范的带动下，展开了丰产竞赛运动；东北区已有五百多个互助组和成千成万的农民卷入了丰产竞赛热潮。
    这一爱国生产运动的迅速发展，充分显示了我国广大农民在抗美援朝爱国主义的教育下，生产情绪空前高涨。当这一运动开始时，许多劳动模范和互助组，都自动地召开家庭会、互助组会，认真地制订了全年生产计划，热烈地参加了竞赛。从各地劳动模范和互助组所提出的生产竞赛计划来看，大多具有以下几个特点：
    （一）着重提高农业技术。许多互助组的应战计划，都是以精耕细作，多施肥料，治水除虫和充实互助组新内容为主要条件。如吉林省韩恩互助组提出与供销合作社相联系，以保证推销土产和供应生产资料，陕北老区许多应战互助组都提出成立农事研究小组，提高农业技术等，都是很好的例子。
    （二）强调检查、总结。各地应战劳动模范和互助组在应战书中不仅订出具体的增产计划，而且都订出了检查和执行计划的保证条件。如山西省黎城县石寸金等二百九十八位劳动模范，聘请了十五位专署和县的负责干部组织评判委员会，检查应战计划执行的情况，准备今年秋后总评。黑龙江省王振堂互助组，规定每七天开一次各业负责人的会议（他组内是按每人特长实行分工分业的），检查应战计划完成程度，在每一个农事季节进行一次检查总结。这些都是保证完成竞赛计划的有效办法。
    （三）抓紧农事季节，进行评比。如山东省吕鸿宾互助组在今年春耕期间，已经评比了耕作方法。通过这一次评比，使全体组员进一步地认识了改良耕作法对保证今年粮食增产的重要性。
    现在，全国各地已开始春耕，各地领导机关正抓紧这个季节，帮助应战劳动模范和互助组贯彻应战计划，完成春耕播种任务。
