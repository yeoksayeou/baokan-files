　　Greeting the "May Day" Grand Demonstration: Shanxi Province Formulates Plan for Resisting America and Aiding Korea
　  Striving to Popularize the Movement to Resist America and Aid Korea
    By our special correspondent Wu Xiang
    After the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the "Decision and Plan on Greeting the 'May Day' Grand Demonstration and Popularizing and Deepening the Movement to Resist America and Aid Korea" at the end of March, the movement to resist America and aid Korea in Shanxi Province has entered a new stage. The characteristic of this stage is that the entire province, from top to bottom, has universally formulated popularization plans, changing the piecemeal approach of the past. Therefore, the serious imbalance that existed in the movement in the past has begun to change, ensuring that the call issued by the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, to ensure that every place and every person receives patriotic education in resisting America and aiding Korea, can be realized.
    Formulating plans is an important step in popularizing and deepening the propaganda and education movement to resist America and aid Korea. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first set an example for the entire province with its own plan. Immediately following this, in early April, the party committees of 92 counties in the six special districts of Yuci, Changzhi, Yuncheng, Xinxian, Xingxian, and Linfen successively formulated their own specific plans based on the provincial party committee's plan and local conditions. Under the promotion and influence of the party committees, most enterprises, people's organizations at all levels, people's representative conferences at all levels, and associations for resisting America and aiding Korea, etc., have also formulated plans. The Shanxi Daily recently also received specific plans from the preparatory committee of the Taiyuan City Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Xiyang Federation of Industry and Commerce, Taiyuan Middle School, National Normal School, the attached elementary school of Taiyuan Normal School, the amateur school of Taiyuan Machine Factory, Xiyang Fifth Senior Primary School, the faculty and staff of the Mingyuan Catholic School, the Pingyao Grain Branch Company, the business section of the Native Produce Company, the Taiyuan First Cultural Center, the Yu County Cultural Center, the Huguan Cultural Center, Huguan Fifth District, Yushe Fourth District, the Yushe Dazhai Model Village, the Xiyang Nanguan Street Club, and many reporters and propagandists. The breadth of the planning scope and the speed of the timing have surpassed any previous movement. Facts prove that when formulating plans, leaders must understand the development of the movement and the confused understandings that cadres and the masses still have in their minds. Without this, it is impossible to determine the specific steps of the popularization movement, and understanding these situations is the decisive link in guiding the movement towards normal development. The Yuci Prefectural Committee formulated three different guidelines and approaches for the three different types of regions with relatively deep, beginning to deepen, and lagging movements, respectively, and concentrated its efforts to send more cadres to help lagging regions carry out work. The Xinxian Prefectural Committee strictly criticized the erroneous views that "propagating to the masses conflicts with work" and that "propaganda, shouting slogans, posting slogans, parades and demonstrations, and signing and voting are ineffective." The Changzhi County Committee, through inspection, found that resisting America and aiding Korea in the past only remained at the level of words and meetings and could not be combined with actual work. The plan then determined that each district should go deep into one or two villages before April 20 to create models, and then promote them.
    When the Propaganda Department of the Taiyuan Fourth District Committee went deep into the model to help Guanmenqian Village formulate a plan, it found that none of the cadres, party members, or league members in the village knew the content of the Five-Power Pact for Peace, and only four people knew that American imperialism was arming Japan. Therefore, this plan is not only a great impetus to the anti-American and aid-Korea movement in the province, but also a great inspection; it not only made the cadres at all levels further clearly recognize that the anti-American and aid-Korea movement is the driving force of all work, but also found the weaknesses of this movement and how to popularize and deepen it. In the past, the economic sector generally neglected politics, but this time it also moved, and some automatically formulated specific plans. But on the whole, the economic sector is still relatively weak and has not formed a series of complete plans.
    The plans in various places have emphasized the backbone role of cadres, party members, and league members, and resolutely guaranteed to complete the requirements of the provincial party committee, so that 50,000 cadres above the district level, 280,000 party members, and 180,000 league members in the province can not only actively participate themselves, but also carry out propaganda and mobilization to at least ten people, and lead them to participate in the "May Day" demonstration parade. Regarding how to mobilize all propaganda forces and use various propaganda tools, many plans have put forward specific methods: Many counties have planned to hold special meetings for reporters and propagandists to specifically allocate the location, frequency, and number of people to be propagandized, and then train activists who have emerged in the mass movement to establish a propaganda network. The Taiyuan City First District plans to have the district committee and the Public Security Bureau be responsible for concentrating all household registration personnel for training, and through them, popularize the propaganda to remote alleys and every household. The Shanxi District Committee of the Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union plans to launch a competition in April for each postal worker to develop one newspaper and publicize to ten people, turning each postal worker into a propagandist and conducting propaganda to remote mountain villages and recipients of mail. The plan of the Yushe Dazhai Model Village proposes that for the 49 women in the village who are older and have many children, special personnel should be assigned to carry out propaganda to stimulate their political enthusiasm. Because the business section of the Native Produce Company lacks special opportunities to conduct propaganda and education to the masses, it plans to use off-office hours and the time when it trades with the masses to conduct propaganda, ensuring that each person publicizes to at least ten people. Xiyang plans to organize five temple fairs. In addition to exchanging materials, farm tools, and livestock at the temple fairs, it also plans to use Yangko dances, clapper talks, operas, lectures, exhibitions, slides, and broadcasting equipment to conduct centralized propaganda. However, some counties have not paid attention to using activists to mobilize intermediate and backward masses, but have simply copied the provincial party committee's plan in a uniform way, requiring that a certain number of cadres, party members, and league members in the county stand at the forefront of the movement, and that each person publicize to ten people, and that the number of people participating in signing and voting reach a certain percentage, but have not thought of more specific ways to achieve this.
    To make the plan correct and specific, the past movement must first be inspected. The implementation of the plan must be continuously and timely inspected. Many plans have specifically stipulated the inspection methods: The Xinxian Prefectural Committee plans to directly help a county, a district, and a village formulate plans and inspect their implementation. The cadres in various places who go to the countryside all bear the task of inspecting the implementation of the plan in the local area. Some counties have also drawn up cadres to form inspection teams or groups to select key points for inspection. The Xingxian Prefectural Committee uniformly plans to organize a large number of cadres from the district and county-level agencies to go to the countryside to inspect and help implement the plan, with an average of two cadres per administrative village.
    The Shanxi Daily also published an editorial on the 18th, calling on the province to step up the inspection of the implementation of the plan to resist America and aid Korea, correct deviations, exchange experiences, supplement specific methods, so that each plan can be 100% realized, and so that 11 million people in the province can stand in the ranks of resisting America and aiding Korea.

### 迎接“五一”大示威  山西全省订出抗美援朝计划  为普及抗美援朝运动而斗争

　　迎接“五一”大示威  山西全省订出抗美援朝计划
　  为普及抗美援朝运动而斗争
    本报特约记者　吴象
    中共山西省委在三月底颁布“迎接‘五一’大示威，普及深入抗美援朝运动”的决定和计划以后，山西省的抗美援朝运动已经走上了一个新的阶段。这个阶段的特点，就是全省从上到下普遍订出了普及计划，改变了过去枝枝节节的作法。因此，过去运动中那种严重的不平衡现象已开始转变，使抗美援朝总会发出的让每一处每一人都要受到抗美援朝爱国教育的号召，有了实现的保证。
    订计划是普及深入抗美援朝宣传教育运动的重要步骤。中国共产党山西省委员会首先以自己的计划，向全省作了示范。紧接着在四月上旬，榆次、长治、运城、忻县、兴县、临汾六个专区九十二个县的党委，都先后依据省委的计划和当地情况，订出了各自的具体计划。在党委的推动影响之下，各企业、各级人民团体、各界人民代表会议及抗美援朝会等，也大部订了计划。山西日报最近还收到太原市工商联合会筹委会、昔阳工商联合会、太原中学、国民师范、太原师范附小、太原机器厂业余学校、昔阳第五高小、天主教明原学校教职员、平遥粮食支公司、土产公司业务科、太原第一文化馆、盂县文化馆、壶关文化馆、壶关五区、榆社四区、榆社大寨模范村、昔阳南关街俱乐部等以及许多报告员、宣传员个人的具体计划。订计划范围之广泛，时间之迅速，超过了过去任何的运动。事实证明：订计划时，领导者必须了解运动发展的情况，了解干部和群众的思想上还有那些糊涂认识。不如此就无法确定普及运动的具体步骤，而了解这些情况，则是指导运动向正常发展的决定一环。榆次地委分别对运动比较深入的、开始深入的和落后的三种不同的地区规定了三种不同的方针、作法，集中力量多派干部帮助落后地区开展工作。忻县地委严格批判了认为“向群众宣传与工作有矛盾”、“宣传、喊口号、贴标语、游行示威、签名投票没有作用”等错误观点。长治县委通过检查发现过去抗美援朝只是停留在口头上和会议上，和实际工作结合不起来，在计划中便确定每个区在四月二十日以前要深入一两个村创造典型，然后加以推广。
    太原四区区委宣传部深入典型帮助观门前村订计划时，发现该村干部、党员、团员中竟然没有一个人知道五大国缔结和平公约的内容是什么，知道美帝国主义武装日本的也只有四个人。因此，这次订计划，对全省抗美援朝运动不仅是个大推动，而且是个大检查；不仅使各级干部进一步明确认识抗美援朝运动是一切工作的动力，而且也找到了这个运动的薄弱之处和怎样去普及深入。经济部门过去对政治一般是比较忽视的，这次也动起来了，有的已自动订了具体计划。但是整个说来，经济部门仍然是比较薄弱的，没有形成一系列完整的计划。
    各地的计划都强调了干部、党员、团员的骨干作用，坚决保证完成省委的要求，真正使全省五万区以上干部、二十八万党员、十八万团员，做到除了自己积极参加，并至少向十个群众进行宣传动员，带领他们参加“五一”示威游行。对于如何动员一切宣传力量，运用各种宣传工具，许多计划中提出了具体办法：不少县都计划召开报告员、宣传员的专门会议，具体分配以活动的地点、次数和宣传的人数，然后训练群众运动中涌现的积极分子，建立宣传网。太原市一区计划由区委和公安分局负责把全部户籍员集中训练一次，通过他们把宣传普及到偏僻的小巷和每一户。邮电工会山西区委会计划在四月份开展每个邮工发展一份报、宣传十个人的竞赛，把每个邮工都变成宣传员，向投递邮件的偏僻山庄和收件人进行宣传。榆社大寨模范村的计划中，提出对全村四十九个年纪大和孩子多的妇女，要指定专人进行宣传，启发其政治热情。土产公司业务科因为缺少专门向群众进行宣传教育的机会，便计划利用下办公时间和群众交易当中进行宣传，保证每人至少宣传十个人。昔阳计划组织五个庙会，庙会上除交流物资、农具、牲畜外，还准备用秧歌、快板、戏曲、讲座、展览、幻灯、播音机等集中进行宣传。但是也有些县却没有注意运用积极分子去发动中间及落后的群众，只是千篇一律地套用省委的计划，要求全县多少干部、多少党员、多少团员站在运动的最前列，每人宣传十个人，参加签名投票的人要达到百分之几等，至于如何达到，却没有想更多的具体的办法。
    计划要订得正确、具体，必须先对过去的运动进行检查。计划的贯彻执行，更必须不断地及时地进行检查。许多计划都具体规定了检查办法：忻县地委计划直接帮助一个县、一个区、一个村订出计划，并检查其执行情况。各地下乡的干部，都负担了检查当地执行计划情况的任务，有些县更抽调干部组成检查团或小组，分别选择重点进行检查。兴县地委统一计划组织专区、县两级机关大批干部下乡检查帮助执行计划，平均每个行政村可有两个干部。
    山西日报在十八日又发表了社论，号召全省加紧检查抗美援朝计划的执行情况，纠正偏差，交流经验，补充具体办法，使每个计划都能百分之百地实现，使全省一千一百万人民，都站到抗美援朝的行列中来。
