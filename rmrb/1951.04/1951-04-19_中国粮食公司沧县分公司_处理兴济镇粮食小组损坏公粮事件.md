Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

　　China Grain Company, Cang County Branch
　　Handling of the Incident of Damaged Public Grain by the Xingji Town Grain Team

　　Editor:
    We sincerely accept the criticism published in the "Readers' Letters" section of the People's Daily on February 28th regarding the negligence in grain storage by the Xingji Town Grain Team (previously mistakenly written as Xingji Town Branch) under the China Grain Company, Cang County Branch, and offer the following review:

　　From late June to the end of December last year, the Xingji Town Grain Team purchased a total of 846,805 jin of wheat, which was stored in five warehouses and entrusted to the town's exchange for safekeeping. During relocation in December last year, it was discovered that the wheat in four warehouses had been damaged due to moisture and lack of regular turning and drying, resulting in a total loss of 11,315 jin.

　　The reasons for the loss are as follows:

　　1. First and foremost, the leadership lacked sufficient attention to state property and exhibited serious complacency and bureaucratic tendencies. For example, when entrusting the exchange to store the wheat, no contract was signed with them. When team members reported that the wheat was generating heat, the relevant leaders subjectively believed that no grain had ever been spoiled in previous years, and assumed that this batch of wheat, which had only recently been put into storage, would not have any problems, thereby relaxing the inspection of the team's grain storage work. Therefore, the Cang County Commissioner's Office issued a circular ordering the person in charge of the Cang County Grain Branch to conduct a thorough self-criticism.

　　2. The direct person in charge of the team, Xu Zhenling, failed to clean the bottom of the warehouses before and after the wheat was put into storage; nor did he actively urge repairs after the warehouse walls collapsed. Especially erroneous was Xu's frequent unauthorized provision of public grain to private merchants on credit; therefore, he has been dismissed from his position. In late September last year, Ma Jianjun was transferred to be the person in charge of the grain team. After taking over the work, Ma also failed to conduct strict inspections of the grain stored in each warehouse, resulting in even greater losses, and has also been removed from his post.

　　3. The Xingji Town Exchange, neglecting its responsibility for grain storage, should also be criticized, and it has been decided to waive the grain storage fees.

### 中国粮食公司沧县分公司  处理兴济镇粮食小组损坏公粮事件

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　  中国粮食公司沧县分公司
　  处理兴济镇粮食小组损坏公粮事件编辑同志：
    人民日报二月二十八日“读者来信专页”刊登对中国粮食公司沧县分公司所属兴济镇粮食小组（上次误写为兴济镇分公司），忽视粮食保管的批评，我们诚恳接受，现作如下检讨：
    兴济镇粮食小组在去年六月下旬至十二月底止共收购小麦八十四万六千八百零五斤，分存于五个仓库中，交由该镇交易所保管。去年十二月移仓时，始发现有四个仓库的麦子因受潮湿及久未翻晒，共损失一万一千三百一十五斤。
    造成损失的原因有下面几点：
    一、首先是领导机关对国家财产重视不足，存在着严重的麻痹自满情绪与官僚主义作风。如委托交易所保管这批小麦时，并未与其订立合同。当小组人员反映小麦有发热现象时，有关领导人还主观主义地认为年来从未坏过一粒粮食，相信这批入仓不久的小麦也不致发生什么问题，因而放松了对该组粮食保管工作的检查。为此沧县专署通令沧县粮食分公司负责人应作深刻检讨。
    二、该小组的直接负责人许振岭，在小麦入库前后，不进行清扫仓底的工作；仓墙倒塌后，也不积极督促修理；尤其错误的，是许经常擅自将公家的粮食赊给私商，因此已予以开除的处分。去年九月底调派马建军为该粮食小组负责人，马接收此项工作后，亦未对各仓存粮进行严格检查，以致造成更大损失，亦给予撤职处理。
    三、兴济镇交易所，忽视自己应负保管粮食的责任，也应该受到批评，并决定免给粮食保管费用。
