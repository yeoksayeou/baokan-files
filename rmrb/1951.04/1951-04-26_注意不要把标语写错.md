　　Be Careful Not to Write Slogans Incorrectly Editor Comrades:
    In order to welcome the "May Day" holiday, the people of all circles in Beijing, in conjunction with the publicity of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, have recently posted many slogans on walls and windows. This is a manifestation of the increased political awareness of the people of all circles in Beijing, which is very valuable. However, some of the slogans written are incorrect or inappropriate, and it is worth pointing out. For example, "Support the Five Great Powers to Conclude a Peace Treaty" is written as "The Five Great Powers Conclude a Peace Treaty" or "Support the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty"; others write "Oppose the United States Arming Japan" separately as "Oppose the United States" and "Arming Japan"; on car number 1-01448 there is a sticker that says "Fight to New York and Demand Blood Debt from the American Imperialists," and on car number 1074 there is a sticker that says "Fight to Washington and Capture Truman Alive!" Some of these slogans have their original meaning distorted in the process of simplification or line breaks, while others are simply wrong. This will confuse the masses' thinking, or be used by the enemy as counter-propaganda material. In this regard, it is hoped that the producers themselves will consciously correct the erroneous slogans, and relevant authorities should also check and correct them. In order to avoid errors in slogans, everyone should make slogans based on the "Slogans for Celebrating the 'May Day' Labor Day of 1951" promulgated by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

　　注意不要把标语写错编辑同志：
    北京市各界人民为了迎接“五一”节，结合抗美援朝运动的宣传，最近在墙上、门窗上贴了许多标语，这是北京市各界人民政治觉悟提高的表现，是非常可贵的。但所写的标语中有个别是错误或不适当的，值得提出注意。如把“拥护五大国缔结和平公约”写成“五大国订立和约”或“拥护缔结和约”；还有的把“反对美国武装日本”分开写成“反对美国”、“武装日本”；在一、○一四四八号汽车上贴有“打到纽约去，向美帝讨还血债”，一○七四号汽车上贴有“打到华盛顿，活捉杜鲁门！”这些标语，有的是在简化或分行时把原意弄错了，有的则根本就是错误的。这会混乱群众的思想，或者被敌人用作反宣传的资料。对此，希望制作者本人自觉将错误的标语改正过来，有关机关亦应检查纠正。为了避免标语的错误，大家应该根据中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会颁布的“为庆祝一九五一年‘五一’劳动节的口号”制作标语。
