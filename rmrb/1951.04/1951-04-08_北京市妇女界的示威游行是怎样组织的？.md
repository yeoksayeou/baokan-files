How Was the Demonstration March of Women in Beijing Organized?

The demonstration march held by women in Beijing on January 28th this year against the United States rearming Japan was the largest and most enthusiastic patriotic demonstration march by women in Beijing. The original plan was to mobilize 30,000 people, but actually, more than 45,000 people participated. Among them, more than 23,000 were housewives, and more than 15,000 were participating in political activities for the first time. Because this patriotic demonstration march was a separate political action by women, it greatly enhanced women's sense of ownership and political consciousness. An old woman participating in the march excitedly wiped away her tears and said, "Even the sorghum stalks in the corner of the house are standing up, and we can also take care of national affairs." Many women said, "This time we learned a lot, and we will dare to come out next time." Many women who were reluctant to attend meetings in the past actively participated in various gatherings after the march. Many citizens also changed their views on women because of this, saying, "The women of today are so remarkable!"

What are the reasons for the better organization of this patriotic demonstration march by women? First, the mobilization work was relatively extensive and in-depth, the methods were relatively flexible, and attention was paid to helping the masses solve their difficulties. During the mobilization, on the one hand, the method of using advanced elements to promote the broad masses was adopted, such as students promoting parents, and industrialists and businessmen leading their families; at the same time, universal home visits were conducted, mother-in-law meetings were held, and women were organized to take care of children for each other to reduce the resistance and difficulties for housewives to participate in the march. Second, women leaders and representatives from all strata, parties, and groups, including nuns and sisters, were absorbed to participate in the preparatory work, and they mobilized a large number of people.

However, because the preparation period was short and the publicity work was not done enough, the central slogan of "Oppose the United States arming Japan" was not universally and deeply understood by the masses participating in the demonstration march at that time. To make up for this shortcoming, the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation immediately emphasized the publicity of this slogan to the masses after the march. The people of Beijing suffered greatly from the oppression of Japanese invaders during the eight years of occupation, and their hatred for Japanese imperialism is extremely deep. Strengthening publicity in this regard will greatly enhance the anti-American sentiment of the masses.

### 北京市妇女界的示威游行是怎样组织的？

　　北京市妇女界的示威游行是怎样组织的？
    北京市妇女界在今年一月二十八日所举行的反对美国重新武装日本的示威游行，是北京妇女界爱国示威游行中规模最大、情绪最热烈的一次。这次示威游行原计划动员三万人，实际参加的却有四万五千多人。其中有两万三千多名是家庭妇女，有一万五千多名是第一次参加政治活动的。因为这次爱国示威游行是妇女界单独的政治行动，就大大提高了妇女的主人翁感觉和政治觉悟。参加游行的一个老太太兴奋地擦着眼泪说：“屋角的秫秸也竖起来了，咱也能管国家大事了。”很多妇女都说：“这次长了见识，下次就敢出来了。”很多过去不愿开会的妇女，游行之后，便积极参加各种集会。不少市民也因此改变了对妇女的看法，他们说：“现在的女人们也这样了不起！”
    这次妇女界爱国示威游行组织得较好的原因是什么呢？第一是由于动员工作比较广泛深入，方式比较灵活，并注意帮助群众解决困难。在动员时，一方面采取以先进分子推动广大群众的办法，如学生推动家长，工商业者带动家属；同时又普遍进行了家庭访问，召开婆婆会议，组织妇女互相看顾小孩，以减少家庭妇女参加游行的阻力与困难。第二是由于吸收了各阶层各党派各团体的妇女领袖与代表人物，包括尼姑与修女参加筹备工作，通过他们动员了大批群众。
    但因为筹备期间短促，宣传工作做得不够，致使“反对美国武装日本”的中心口号，未为当时参加示威游行群众所普遍深刻了解。为了弥补这一缺陷，游行后北京市民主妇女联合会即向群众强调宣传了这一口号。北京市人民在八年沦陷期间，备受日寇的压迫，对日本帝国主义的仇恨极深，加强这一方面的宣传，将会大大提高群众的反美情绪。
