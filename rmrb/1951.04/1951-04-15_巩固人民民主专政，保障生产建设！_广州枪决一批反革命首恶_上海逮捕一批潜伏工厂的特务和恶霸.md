    Guangzhou Executes a Batch of Arch-Criminal Counter-Revolutionaries
    Shanghai Arrests a Batch of Secret Agents and Local Bullies Lurking in Factories

　　The Guangzhou Military Control Commission recently executed a batch of counter-revolutionaries with heinous crimes.

　　Among the executed counter-revolutionaries were many high-ranking officers of the Kuomintang bandit army who had engaged in counter-revolutionary warfare for a long time and still plotted riots after liberation, remaining unrepentant until their death. For example, Han Chao, who served as "Lieutenant General and Deputy Commander of the 62nd Army" of the bandits, drafted the "Hainan Comprehensive Communist Suppression Plan" in 1948, massacring the people of Hainan on a large scale. After the liberation of Hainan, he still lurked in Haikou City, plotting to organize counter-revolutionary armed forces. Bandit Tan Baochan served successively as "Deputy Commander of the Security Forces" and "Detachment Commander of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army in the Guangdong-Guangxi Border Region." After liberation, he organized counter-revolutionary armed forces in Luoding County, plotting to riot.

　　Among the executed counter-revolutionaries were also some secret agents dispatched by the US-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang who infiltrated organs and factories to spy on military and political intelligence and seek opportunities for sabotage. For example, the bandit Huang Shaoyu, who was dispatched by the "China Group of the Tokyo Office of the State Department Strategic Committee" of the US intelligence agency to infiltrate our factory, investigated our military facilities and stole important intelligence to supply to the US government. Military Intelligence agent Li Jian had always committed numerous evils. After liberation, he lurked in the city, spying on our military and political intelligence and supplying it to the "South China Dispatch Station of the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense."

　　In addition, among the counter-revolutionaries executed this time were also some extremely wicked local bullies and habitual bandits who had long disrupted social order and still committed armed robbery after liberation. For example, Huang Qin, the local bully and "local emperor" of Xinxing North District, served successively as the bandit self-defense captain and intelligence captain. After liberation, he reorganized the bandit remnants and attacked the district people's government, killing ten working cadres. Chen Tong, the bully who served as the pseudo-county magistrate of Haikang County, captured and killed 114 revolutionary personnel in 1945. After liberation, Bandit Chen organized the "Guangdong Southern Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," plotting rebellion.

　　The Guangzhou Military Control Commission, in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and safeguard the people's lives and property, accepted the demands of the victimized masses and, in accordance with the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, sentenced these incorrigible arch-criminal counter-revolutionaries to capital punishment.

　　After the execution of this batch of counter-revolutionary criminals, people from all walks of life in the city cheered and rejoiced. The wife of the victim Zhu Jiang, upon hearing that the murderer of her husband had been executed, rushed from the countryside of Panyu County to Guangzhou City to thank the people's government.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th: With the exposure and assistance of the broad masses of the people, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau recently arrested a batch of Kuomintang secret agents and local bullies in factories.

　　These counter-revolutionary elements have tried every means to sabotage factory production, causing significant losses to the people's property. For example, more than ten Kuomintang secret agents, including Tan Jincheng, Wu Guohao, and Lu Xiangyuan, lurked in the private Zhengtai Rubber Factory. In the two months from January 16 to March 16 this year, they continuously sabotaged the factory's machinery and equipment more than 20 times. They damaged two large vehicles, damaged tire cloth and hot water radiators, and even attempted to set the Zhengtai Rubber Factory on fire with gasoline. Secret agents Fei Dingzhong, Zhu Yinquan, Wang Pansheng, Zhang Wenbin, Shi Linbao, Chen Wenzhong, and Wang Xuegui, who lurked in the State-owned Cotton Spinning Factory No. 4, damaged two steel wire machines of the factory; they also damaged the water dragon belt and all firefighting equipment. They plotted to set fire to the opening and cleaning workshop to prevent workers from rescuing the situation. Secret agent Huang Xizhang, who lurked in the Dahuali Food Factory, not only failed to sincerely confess when the city held registration for reactionary party and league secret agents but continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. He sabotaged the production of yeast, reducing the output by 250 kilograms. Secret agent Chen Zhanglin, hiding in the Tianzhang Paper Mill, damaged 9,000 pounds of the factory's Daolin paper pulp, causing the factory to lose 40 million yuan.

　　Among the arrested counter-revolutionary elements, some were local bullies with heinous crimes. For example, Wang Songtao, who engaged in counter-revolutionary activities in the private Lunchang Yarn Factory, was a bully who ran rampant in Pudong. After the Japanese surrender, he sneaked into the Lunchang Yarn Factory, organized a puppet trade union and guard team, and served as the "Chairman" and "Captain," specializing in sabotaging the workers' movement. Bully and secret agent Chen Xiaomao raped more than 100 female workers in the private Mifeng Yarn Factory and deducted wages from more than 2,000 workers. After the liberation of Shanghai, Bandit Chen also damaged the factory's No. 3 steel wire machine, causing the factory to lose more than 8,000 pounds of yarn.

　　Workers in various factories deeply hate this group of counter-revolutionary elements who openly opposed the people. When the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested this batch of counter-revolutionary elements, workers in various factories were overjoyed. Many workers said in unison: "Eliminating this batch of counter-revolutionary elements guarantees production!"

    广州枪决一批反革命首恶
    上海逮捕一批潜伏工厂的特务和恶霸
    【新华社广州十四日电】广州市军事管制委员会最近枪决了一批罪大恶极的反革命分子。
    在枪决的反革命分子中，有不少是长期进行反革命战争，解放后仍图暴乱，死不悔改的国民党匪军的高级军官。如曾任匪“六十二军中将副军长”的韩潮，一九四八年曾拟订“海南全面剿共计划”，大肆屠杀海南人民。海南解放后，仍潜伏海口市，阴谋组织反革命武装。谭匪宝灿，历任匪“保安副司令”、“粤桂边区反共救国军支队长”等职，解放后又在罗定县组织反革命武装，阴谋暴乱。
    在枪决的反革命分子中，还有一些是受美蒋匪帮派遣，打入机关、工厂内部，刺探军政情报和伺机破坏的特务分子。如接受美国特务机关“国务院战略委员会东京办事处驻香港中国组”派遣打入我工厂进行活动的黄匪绍瑜，曾调查我方军事设施，窃取重要情报供给美国政府。军统特务李健，一向作恶多端，解放后潜伏本市，刺探我军政情报，供给匪“国防部二厅华南派遣站”。
    此外，在这次枪决的反革命分子中还有一些是罪大恶极的恶霸分子和长期扰乱社会秩序，解放后仍持枪抢劫的惯匪分子。如新兴北区的恶霸“土皇帝”黄勤，历任匪自卫大队长、谍报队长等职，解放后又收编匪残部，袭击区人民政府，杀害工作干部十人。曾任伪海康县长的恶霸陈桐，在一九四五年曾捕杀革命人员一百十四名。解放后，陈匪又组织“广东南反共救国军”，阴谋叛乱。
    广州市军事管制委员会为巩固人民民主专政，维护人民生命财产，接受被难群众的要求，根据惩治反革命条例，将这些怙恶不悛的反革命首恶分子处以极刑。
    在枪决了这批反革命罪犯以后，本市各界人民均欢腾鼓舞，额手称庆。被害人朱江的妻子，听说杀害亲夫的凶犯已处决，特由番禺县乡间赶到广州市向人民政府道谢。
    【新华社上海十二日电】在广大人民的检举和协助下，上海市人民政府公安局最近在工厂中逮捕了一批国民党特务分子和恶霸分子。
    这些反革命分子，曾经千方百计地破坏工厂生产，使人民财产遭致重大损失。例如：国民党特务分子谭进城、吴国浩、陆祥元等十余人潜伏于私营正泰橡胶厂中，在今年一月十六日至三月十六日的两个月中，连续破坏该厂机器设备达二十次之多。他们破坏了两部大车，破坏了车胎布、热水汀，还企图用汽油把正泰橡胶厂烧光。潜伏在国营棉纺第四厂的特务费定中、朱银泉、王盘声、张文斌、施林宝、陈文忠、王学贵等，破坏了该厂两架钢丝车；还破坏了水龙皮带及所有的救火用具，他们阴谋在放火焚烧清花车间时，使工人们无法施救。潜伏于大华利食料厂的特务分子黄锡章，在该市举办反动党团特务登记时，不但不真诚坦白，反而继续进行反革命活动。他在制造酵母时进行破坏，使酵母减产二百五十公斤。隐蔽在天章造纸厂的特务分子陈章林，破坏了该厂道林纸浆九千磅，使该厂损失四千万元。
    在逮捕的这批反革命分子中，有一些是罪大恶极的恶霸分子。如在私营纶昌纱厂中进行反革命活动的王松涛，是横行浦东的恶霸，日寇投降后潜入纶昌纱厂，组织伪工会和护工队，自任“理事长”及“大队长”，专门破坏工人运动。恶霸特务分子陈小毛，在私营蜜丰纱厂内先后强奸一百多个女工，先后克扣两千多工人的工资。上海解放后，陈匪又破坏了该厂三号钢丝车，使该厂损失八千多磅绒线。
    各工厂工人对这批明目张胆与人民为敌的反革命分子，恨之入骨。当上海市人民政府公安局逮捕了这批反革命分子后，各工厂工人莫不称快。很多工人都异口同声地说：清除这批反革命分子，生产就有了保障啦！
