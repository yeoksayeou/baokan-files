　　Promotion of Superior Varieties Should Be Cautious
    The Tangshan Area Blindly Promoted 150,000 Jin of "Youzi" Wheat Seeds, Suffering Losses
    To the Editor:
    Last autumn, the Tangshan Farm promoted 150,000 jin of "Youzi" wheat seeds in thirteen counties of the Tangshan area. Because no variety acclimation trials were conducted before the promotion, and farmers were not informed to prepare for cold protection, all the wheat seedlings from these 150,000 jin of seeds were frozen to death. This incident not only caused great losses to the farmers, but also created obstacles for the continued promotion of superior varieties. Therefore, I would like to offer two points regarding this matter:
    1.  In the future, before promoting a certain superior variety, the responsible authorities must carefully study and conduct variety acclimation trials. After trials by county farms, specially contracted farmers, and demonstration households, widespread promotion should then be carried out.
    2.  For those farmers who suffered losses due to the planting of "Youzi" wheat seeds, the government should help them replant or compensate for the losses in other ways.
            Bó Guāng
    Editor's Note: Comrade Bó Guāng's opinion is correct. We hope that the relevant authorities will promptly review this matter and take effective remedial measures.

### 推广优良品种应该慎重  唐山专区盲目推广十五万斤蚰子麦种遭受损失

　　推广优良品种应该慎重
    唐山专区盲目推广十五万斤蚰子麦种遭受损失
    编辑同志：
    唐山农场于去年秋季在唐山专区十三个县中推广蚰子麦种十五万斤。因为在推广前没有进行品种风土试验，亦未向农民说明要作防寒准备，以致使这十五万斤种子的麦苗全部冻死。这件事情不仅使农民受到了很大的损失。而且为继续推广优良品种工作造成了障碍。因此，我对这件事要提出两点意见：
    一、今后在推广某一种优良品种以前，负责机关必须认真研究并进行品种风土试验，通过县农场和特约农家及示范户的试种后，再进行普遍推广。
    二、对于这次播种蚰子麦种而受到损失的各农户，政府应帮助他们进行补种，或以其他办法弥补此种损失。
            伯光
    编者按：伯光同志的意见是对的，希望有关机关对此事速作检讨并进行有效的善后措施。
