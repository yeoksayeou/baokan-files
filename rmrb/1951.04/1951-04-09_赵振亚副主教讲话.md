Speech by Associate Bishop Zhao Zhenya

Respected leaders, honored guests, clergy, and fellow parishioners:

Today is the founding day of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association. We are sincerely grateful to the leaders and guests who have taken time out of their busy schedules to attend and guide us. For the past century, the Catholic Church has consistently been used by imperialism as a tool for aggression. Looking back at history, Catholicism was introduced to China by imperialists, with one hand holding guns and cannons and the other holding dollars and pounds, using threats, inducements, and unequal treaties. All unequal treaties included "freedom of religion" as an important item, which is no coincidence. How many times in history have imperialist wars of aggression, stained with the blood of the Chinese people, such as the Anglo-French Allied Forces in 1858, the Sino-French War in 1884, and the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900, did imperialism not use religious cases as an excuse? The countless crimes of priests in China, such as seizing land, monopolizing lawsuits, infringing upon sovereignty, committing brutal killings, and extorting ransoms, are truly too numerous to list. Taking Tianjin as an example, the famous "Xikai Church Case" was precisely a primitive and spontaneous anti-imperialist movement by the Chinese people. More recent examples include the Shang Jianxun case in Xianxian, the espionage cases in Qiqihar, Shenyang, Jiaozuo, Shijiazhuang, and other places uncovered during the Liberation War, as well as the "Catholic Patriotic Group," the "People's National Construction Association," and the espionage cases of Bu Xiangxian, Bao Yihua, Fang Ruhui, and others uncovered in Tianjin. Do not all these illustrate the conspiracy of imperialism to use religion to carry out aggressive activities? After its defeat on the Chinese mainland, American imperialism is trying to maintain its reactionary influence through the church, attempting to intensify espionage and sabotage activities under the cover of the church. Today, there are still some imperialist elements in our church who are wearing religious cloaks and carrying out espionage activities for American imperialism. We patriotic, country-loving, and religion-loving Catholics should rise up, unite with the people of the whole country, and resolutely and thoroughly eliminate all imperialist elements within the church to protect the security of our motherland.

On January 13th of this year, we Catholics in Tianjin, based on the principles of anti-imperialism, patriotism, and love of religion, loudly issued the Tianjin Catholic Reform Declaration. Under the leadership of the preparatory committee of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association, which was organized by progressive Catholics, the reform movement gradually shattered the imperialists' activities of sowing discord and sabotaging through tortuous, complex, and arduous sharp struggles. In just three months, it has gained the signatures of over 15,000 Catholics, which is a great victory.

Today is the founding day of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association, which is also the day to declare the death of imperialist elements within the Catholic Church. In the future, our task is to resolutely cut off all ties with imperialism, eliminate all imperialist influence, implement the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, thoroughly implement self-government, self-support, and self-propagation, and transform all undertakings of the Chinese Catholic Church, which have always been controlled by foreigners, especially imperialist elements, into undertakings run by the Chinese people themselves. We must also work with the people of the whole country to assist the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and deeply develop the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country. Only in this way can we win the sympathy of the people of the whole country, and only in this way can our church have a bright future. Naturally, we may encounter some difficulties in the course of our work, but we have the confidence and strength to achieve final victory with the support of all Catholics and the broad masses of the people.

Finally, on behalf of the clergy and Catholics of the entire city of Tianjin, I guarantee that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will do a good job in the anti-imperialist, patriotic, and religion-loving movement. We are also ready to respond to the government's call at any time and take practical actions to accomplish this great historical task of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending our homes and country.

　　赵振亚副主教讲话各位首长、各位来宾、神长、教友们：
    今天是我们天津市天主教革新运动促进会成立大会的日子，承蒙各位首长和各位来宾于百忙中拨冗莅会指导，我们谨以至诚向各位致谢。近百年来我们天主教一贯的被帝国主义利用，做为侵略的工具。翻开历史来看，天主教传入中国是帝国主义一手拿着枪炮一手拿着美元、英镑，用威胁利诱和不平等条约以俱来的。一切不平等条约中都把“传教自由”列为重要的一项，这不是偶然的。历史上多少次丧权辱国染满中国人民鲜血的帝国主义侵略战争如一八五八年英法联军，一八八四年中法战争，一九○○年八国联军，那一次帝国主义不是借口教案呢？教士在中国霸占田产、包揽诉讼、侵犯主权、逞凶残杀、勒索赎款等无数罪行，真是罄竹难书。就天津来讲，有名的“西开教案”正是中国人民原始的自发反侵略运动，最近的例子如解放战争中连续破获的献县尚建勋案，齐齐哈尔、沈阳、焦作、石家庄等地的间谍案，以及我们天津破获的“公教报国团”、“民众建国协进会”、及卜相贤、鲍翊华、房如晦等间谍案。所有这些不正是说明帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略活动的阴谋吗？美帝国主义在中国大陆失败以后正在力图经过教会来保持它的反动影响，妄想在教会的掩护下，加紧进行间谍破坏活动。今天我们教会中还有一些披着宗教外衣，为美帝国主义进行间谍活动的帝国主义分子。我们反帝、爱国、爱教的教友们应当起来，跟全国人民一道坚决彻底地消灭教会内的一切帝国主义分子以保卫祖国安全。
    今年一月十三日我们天津市天主教徒，基于反帝、爱国、爱教的原则下，响亮地发表了天津市天主教革新宣言。革新运动是在进步的教友们所组织的天津市天主教革新运动促进会委员会筹备会领导下的，经过了曲折复杂和艰苦的尖锐斗争，才逐渐地粉碎了帝国主义者挑拨离间与阴谋破坏活动。在短短三个月内竟获得了拥有一万五千多教友的签名，这是一个伟大的胜利。
    今天是我们天津市天主教革新运动促进会成立的日子，也就是宣布天主教内帝国主义分子死亡的日子。今后我们的任务是坚决的斩断与帝国主义的一切联系，肃清帝国主义的一切影响，实施三自运动，彻底实行自治自养自传，把一向为外国人特别是帝国主义分子所把持的中国天主教的一切事业变为中国人民自办的事业。并和全国人民一起协助政府镇压反革命，深入展开抗美援朝卫国保家运动。只有这样我们才能博得全国人民的同情，也只有这样我们的教会才有光明的前途。自然在工作进行中可能还会遇到一些困难，但是，我们有信心也有力量在全体教友拥护与广大人民的支持下，我们一定能够获得最后胜利。
    最后，我代表全天津市的神职班和教友们，保证在毛主席的领导下，作好反帝、爱国、爱教运动。并随时准备响应政府的号召，以实际行动来完成抗美援朝保家卫国，这一伟大的历史任务。
