　　Chengde City People's Rally at Shuiquangou
　　Publicly Mourning Compatriots Killed by Japanese Invaders
　　Resolutely Opposing the United States Arming Japan
    【本报讯】According to Xinhua News Agency: Seven thousand five hundred people from all walks of life in Chengde City held a public memorial meeting for the deceased compatriots at Shuiquangou in the suburbs of the city on the Qingming Festival. This place was sprinkled with the blood of the anti-Japanese people. Luo Chengde, Chairman of the People's Government of Rehe Province, who presided over the ceremony, paid tribute to the cemetery of the deceased compatriots. Participants then recalled with deep sorrow the massacre crimes committed by the Japanese invaders in the area. All participants swore before the cemetery of the deceased compatriots, expressing their firm opposition to the United States arming Japan, and their determination to improve the patriotic production movement to enhance the economic strength of the country.
    Note: Shuiquangou is located in the western suburbs of Chengde City and was a killing field during the Japanese occupation of Rehe. Tens of thousands of patriotic compatriots sacrificed here during the thirteen years. The vast majority of them were Communist Party members, guerrillas, and patriotic people unwilling to be submissive subjects of the Japanese invaders, who persisted in the anti-Japanese struggle in Xinglong, Chengde, and other counties (the then-uninhabited areas) north of the Great Wall. They were massacred here in batches by the Japanese invaders using methods such as beheading, shooting, electrocution, and hanging. At that time, the mountains and plains were covered with the corpses of patriots. After the Northeast was liberated on August 15, the local people's government collected more than 8,000 white bones from the ditch and reburied them in a common grave for the deceased compatriots.

　　承德市人民集会水泉沟
  　公祭被日寇杀害的同胞
  　坚决反对美国武装日本
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：承德市各界人民七千五百多人于清明节在洒满抗日人民鲜血的市郊水泉沟举行了公祭死难同胞大会。主祭人热河省人民政府主席罗成德向死难同胞公墓致祭后，与祭者怀着沉痛的回忆控诉了日寇在当地的屠杀罪行。全体与祭者在死难同胞公墓前宣誓，表示坚决反对美国武装日本，并要搞好爱国生产运动以增强国家的经济力量。
    按：水泉沟在承德市西郊，是日寇侵占热河期间的杀人场。十三年中牺牲在这里的爱国同胞数以万计。他们绝大多数是在长城以北兴隆、承德等县（当时的无人区）坚持抗日斗争的共产党员、游击队员和不愿当日寇顺民的爱国人民。他们被日寇以刀劈、枪毙、电刑、绞刑等手段成批地屠杀在这儿。当时，这里漫山遍野全是爱国者的尸体。“八一五”东北解放后，当地人民政府曾在沟内收集了八千多白骨，合葬为死难同胞公墓。
