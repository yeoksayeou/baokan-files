The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang instructs local organizations
Calling for Enthusiastic Participation in Signing in Support of the Peace Pact and Voting on the Japanese Issue

[Our Newspaper] To promote local organizations' activities of signing in support of the Peace Pact and voting on the Japanese issue, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has issued the following specific instructions to local organizations:

I. In terms of ideological education, we must enable comrades within the Party and the masses connected with the Party to deeply understand that responding to the resolution of the World Peace Council is inseparable from the sacred struggle task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. In particular, supporting the five major powers in concluding a peace pact; opposing the United States arming Japan; and opposing the United States' separate peace treaty with Japan, is more in line with the consistent peaceful aspirations and vital interests of the entire Chinese people. The Chinese people have always supported world peace and opposed world war. Therefore, they firmly advocate the conclusion of a peace pact among China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to resolve the Korean issue, the Asian issue, and global issues through peaceful means. However, the American aggressors and their accomplices not only refuse to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, but also actively prepare to rearm Germany and Japan, expanding the war of aggression, all of which are heading down the road of destroying world peace and threatening human security. From this, we should recognize that American imperialism and its accomplices are the great enemies of the entire Chinese and world peace-loving people. Our signing today in support of the conclusion of the five-power peace pact is to express the firm will and great strength of the entire Chinese and world peace-loving people to defend world peace. Our voting on the Japanese issue today is to express our firm opposition to American imperialism arming Japan, opposing a separate peace treaty with Japan, advocating the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, and promoting the peace and democratic aspirations of the Japanese people. Therefore, we must vigorously publicize and promote the significance and spirit of this signing and voting campaign in accordance with the documents promulgated by the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, in order to promote the popularization and in-depth effect of the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

II. The methods and approaches to leading and carrying out this movement should be flexible. In addition to large-scale rallies where cooperation with local democratic parties and people's organizations should be carried out to achieve greater results, various small-scale meetings can also be held within the Party to carry out signing and voting in accordance with the prescribed methods, so as to ensure that every comrade within the Party and the masses connected with the Party receive this peace, democratic, and patriotic education, and demonstrate a force in support of world peace and the fight against imperialist aggressors.

III. The General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea has also announced the "Notice on Singing During the May 1st Labor Day Demonstration Parade," which stipulates five songs, hoping that the people of the whole country will work hard to learn to sing them. In particular, the National Anthem (March of the Volunteers) and the Battle Song of the Chinese People's Volunteers (Defeat the American Wolves) are the basic songs to be sung during the demonstration parade. Comrades of our Party should enthusiastically learn to sing them, and sing them proficiently during gatherings and parades, so as to enhance the passionate emotions of loving the country, loving the people, loving the government, loving peace, and loving our heroic patriotic volunteer soldiers.

IV. In terms of checking work, summarizing experiences, and reporting achievements, it is hoped that local organizations will, after the completion of their own signing and voting movement work, report in detail the prior plans, the process of implementation, the achievements obtained, and the advantages and disadvantages discovered, for the central government to refer to, and to allow for the exchange of experiences between regions.

　　民革中央委员会指示各地方组织
    号召热烈参加拥护缔结和平公约的签名及关于日本问题的投票
    【本报讯】中国国民党革命委员会为促进各地方组织举行关于拥护缔结和平公约的签名及关于日本问题的投票，特对各地方组织发出具体指示如下：
    一、在思想教育上，我们必须使党内同志及与党有联系的群众深切了解响应世界和平理事会的决议是与抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣斗争任务不能分开的，特别是拥护五大国缔结和平公约；反对美国武装日本；反对美国单独对日媾和，是与全中国人民的一向和平志愿及切身的利益更相符合的。中国人民从来是拥护世界和平而反对世界战争的，因此，也坚决主张缔结中、苏、美、英、法五大国和平公约，以和平方法解决朝鲜问题、亚洲问题以及全世界的问题；但是美国侵略者及其帮凶们不但拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题，而且积极准备重新武装德国、武装日本，扩大侵略战争，一切一切，都向破坏世界和平威胁人类安全的道路上走去。由此我们应认定美帝国主义及其帮凶们是全中国和全世界爱好和平人民的大敌人。我们今日举行拥护缔结五国和平公约签名，就是表示全中国和全世界爱好和平人民保卫世界和平的坚决意志与伟大力量；我们今日举行关于日本问题的投票，就是表示我们坚决反对美帝国主义武装日本，反对单独对日媾和，主张缔结全面的对日和约，并促进日本人民的和平民主的愿望与态度。因此我们对于这次举行签名投票运动的意义与精神，必须根据抗美援朝总会公布的文件大力宣传，多方鼓动，用以促进普及和深入抗美援朝运动的效果。
    二、在领导进行这一运动的方式方法上，要灵活运用。除在大规模的集会上应与当地民主党派，人民团体协作进行收得更大效果外，本党内部亦可举行多种小型会议，依照规定办法，进行签名投票，务使党内每一同志及与党有联系的群众受到这一运动的和平民主爱国教育，并表现拥护世界和平和打击帝国主义侵略者的一份力量。
    三、抗美援朝总会并公布了“关于五一劳动节示威游行时唱歌的通知”内中规定五首歌曲，希望全国人民努力学习会唱，特别是国歌（义勇军进行曲）及中国人民志愿军战歌（打败美国野心狼）为示威游行时所唱的基本歌曲，本党同志应热烈学习会唱，在集会和游行时，纯熟唱出，提高爱国家、爱人民、爱政府，爱和平以及爱我们英勇卫国的志愿军战士们的热烈情绪。
    四、在检查工作，总结经验、报告成绩这一方面，希望各地方组织于自己举行签名投票运动工作结束后，即将事前的计划，推行的经过，获得的成绩，发现的优点与缺点，详为报告，借供中央参考，并可使各地交流经验。
