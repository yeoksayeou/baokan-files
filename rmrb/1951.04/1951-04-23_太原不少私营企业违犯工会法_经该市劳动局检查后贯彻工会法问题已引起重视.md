    Many Private Enterprises in Taiyuan Violate the Trade Union Law
    After Inspection by the City Labor Bureau, Importance Has Been Attached to the Implementation of the Trade Union Law

To the Editor:
    The Trade Union Law has been promulgated for almost ten months, and there are still many private enterprise owners in Taiyuan who are unwilling to implement the Trade Union Law; the phenomenon of violating the Trade Union Law is also quite serious. Therefore, in early March, we conducted inspections in conjunction with trade unions and other relevant departments, and it is expected that all inspections will be completed by the end of April. Now I will tell you about the problems found in the inspection:
    Many private enterprise owners do not understand or even distort the Trade Union Law. For example, the manager of the private Simin Wood Factory said: "The Trade Union Law is a matter for the workers and is not beneficial to the capitalists. Allocating trade union funds is almost the same as paying taxes." The chairman of the Bathhouse Industry Guild said: "Implement the Trade Union Law? Our direct superior has not yet given instructions." Workers at the private Tianxin Inn participate in the trade union secretly, fearing that the capitalists will find out and make things difficult for them. In many civil engineering construction factories, there are neither factory management committees nor labor-capital consultation meetings, excluding workers from the production management circle. The owner of the private Jinyi Iron Factory undermines worker solidarity and co-opts trade union group leaders among the workers, such as giving them special meals and secretly increasing wages, so that they become detached from the masses.
    The phenomenon of beating and scolding workers and illegally dismissing workers is also very serious. The wife of the manager of Zhengji Clothing Store, because apprentices poured water poorly, used too much oil when cooking, or had dirty hands when serving food, beat and scolded the apprentices three times in a row. The private Zhonghe Chemical Factory dismissed nine workers without notifying the trade union. The Gongji Iron Factory illegally forced thirteen workers to leave. Within March, the Simin Wood Factory dismissed eighteen workers without going through the trade union.
    In order to facilitate dismissal and control of workers, and to pay less trade union funds, some owners have adopted the method of hiring temporary workers. The Fuhe Noodle Shop has nineteen workers, but only reported six formal workers, and the rest are regarded as temporary workers; but most of them have worked for more than three months or a full year. The Juxingfeng Electric Mill replaced seventy temporary workers in one year; while there are only three long-term workers in the factory. Twenty-nine of the forty-four workers in the Zhang Qiulai Iron Factory are temporary workers.
    The phenomenon of arrears and deductions of workers' wages is also serious. Long-term workers in the Simin Wood Factory work fourteen hours a day, and work the same in winter and summer, but in winter they only provide meals and do not pay wages. The owner does not care if the workers are sick. The toilet and workshop of the Zhang Qiulai Iron Factory are next to each other, which is very unsanitary.
    Of the city's fifty-five private industries, only the bathhouse industry has basically paid off the trade union funds after the trade union's efforts; other industries have either not paid at all or have paid some. In the five industries of hardware and electrical materials, etc., among the sixty-nine households, twenty households concealed and underreported trade union funds. Of the city's fifty-five private industries, only seven industries have allocated offices to the trade unions (private grassroots trade unions are organized by industry), and the remaining industries have not resolved this.
    In the process of inspection, we promptly dealt with enterprises that did not implement the Trade Union Law. In general, in addition to ordering them to make self-criticisms, they also guaranteed that they would earnestly implement the Trade Union Law in the future; in serious cases, they were ordered to publicly admit their mistakes, or publish self-criticisms in newspapers to ensure that they would not violate the law again. After the inspection, the issue of implementing the Trade Union Law has attracted the close attention of both labor and capital in the city. It is believed that on the basis of this major inspection, the Trade Union Law can be basically implemented in this city.
            Taiyuan Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau

    Editor's Note: The Taiyuan Municipal Labor Bureau's comprehensive inspection of the implementation of the Trade Union Law is an effective method for implementing the Trade Union Law. However, it must be recognized that the thorough implementation of the Trade Union Law must go through an arduous struggle process. All grassroots trade unions should exercise the rights granted to trade union organizations by the state and continue to fight against all phenomena that violate the Trade Union Law; relevant leading organs should also strengthen inspection and supervision to ensure the thorough implementation of the Trade Union Law.

### 太原不少私营企业违犯工会法  经该市劳动局检查后贯彻工会法问题已引起重视

    太原不少私营企业违犯工会法
    经该市劳动局检查后贯彻工会法问题已引起重视编辑同志：
    工会法颁布快要十个月了，太原市还有不少私营企业的资方不愿意执行工会法；违犯工会法的现象也相当严重。因此我们在三月上旬会同工会等有关部门进行检查，预计四月底可全部检查完毕。现将检查中发现的问题告诉你们：
    不少私营企业的资方不了解甚至曲解工会法。如私营四民木厂的经理说：“工会法是工人的事，对资方没有利，拨交工会经费和上税差不多。”澡堂业同业公会理事长说：“执行工会法？我们的直接上级还没有下指示。”私营天心栈工人参加工会是秘密的，怕资方知道了和他们为难。许多土木建筑厂中，既没有工厂管理委员会，又没有劳资协商会议，将工人排斥于生产管理圈外。私营晋义铁工厂资方破坏工人团结，拉拢工人中的工会组长，比如给他们吃小锅饭，暗加工资等，使他们脱离群众。
    打骂工人和非法解雇工人的现象也很严重。正记服装店经理的老婆，因为学徒倒水倒的不好、炒菜用油多了、端饭时手脏等小事情，曾连续三次打骂学徒。私营中和化学厂不通知工会，解雇了九个工人。工记铁工厂非法逼走十三个工人。四民木厂在三月份内，不经过工会解雇工人十八名。
    为了便于解雇与控制工人，以及少交工会经费，有些资方采取了雇佣临时工的办法。复合面店有十九个工人，只报了六个正式工人，其余的都当作临时工；但他们多系工作三个月以上或满一年的工人。聚兴丰电磨厂一年撤换了七十个临时工；而厂里的长期工人，只有三个。张秋来铁工厂四十四个工人中就有二十九个是临时工。
    拖欠克扣工人工资的现象也严重。四民木厂的长期工人每日工作十四小时，冬天和夏天一样劳动，但是冬天只管饭，不给工资。工人有病资方也不管。张秋来铁工厂的厕所和工房靠在一块，很不卫生。
    全市五十五个私营行业，只有澡塘业经过工会的争取，大体交清工会经费；其它各行业有的根本未交，有的交过一些。五金电料等五个行业六十九户中，隐瞒少报工会经费者即达二十户。全市五十五个私营行业，只有七个行业拨给工会办公室（私营基层工会是以行业为单位组织的），其余各行业均未解决。
    在检查过程中，我们对不执行工会法的企业，均及时作了适当处理。一般的除令其作检讨外，并保证今后切实执行工会法；情况严重的，则令其公开承认错误，或登报检讨保证以后不再违犯。经过检查，贯彻执行工会法的问题，已引起全市劳资双方的密切注意。相信在这次大检查的基础上，工会法在本市即可基本上贯彻执行。
            太原市人民政府劳动局
    编者按：太原市劳动局普遍检查工会法执行情况，这是贯彻执行工会法的一个有效方法。但必须认识：彻底实施工会法还须经过一个艰巨的斗争过程。各基层工会应该运用国家所赋予工会组织的权利，继续向一切违犯工会法的现象作斗争；有关领导机关亦应加强检查和督促，才能保证工会法的彻底实施。
