    Everyone Talking About Hatred of U.S. Imperialism Greatly Increases Production Enthusiasm
    Editor:
    After the propaganda about resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country in our village (Shiwangou Village, Da'an Township, Fifth District, Fei County, Shandong Province), everyone's production enthusiasm is very high, and the hatred for U.S. imperialism is even deeper.
    In order to inspire the masses' patriotic enthusiasm, the party members and cadres in our village held a meeting together. At the meeting, I first talked about my own history and my understanding of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. I grew up in poverty. My father died, and my two younger sisters were sold to landlords' families as maids, for a total of fifty catties of soybeans. Not long after my third sister was sold, she was beaten to death by the landlord. Fortunately, the Communist Party led us to defeat the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang, and the poor were liberated. Now the American devils want to invade us again, to make us return to the suffering under the rule of the Kuomintang. I used to have a paralyzing ideology about this matter, and I did not participate in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea with the greatest effort. At the meeting, I made a self-criticism and guaranteed that I would work hard to produce and strengthen national defense in the future. After I finished speaking, many people were moved to tears. Everyone spoke out about the suffering they had suffered in the past, and they were determined to defend their good life today. Zhao Shiying, a female party member who had been beaten to death and then came back to life by the landlord, said: "The reason the landlord dared to beat me back then was that we had no power to resist him. That was because it was the world of the Kuomintang, and the Kuomintang was supported by the American devils. So, if we don't want to be bullied by the landlord again, we have to defeat the American devils' aggression." Under the leadership of the village cadres, the people in our village often talk about these principles, especially when they talk about the hardships of the past. Everyone loves their current life even more, and they are particularly motivated to work.
    The district people's government hoped that our village could plant 300 mu of cotton. In response to the government's call, our village left 360 mu of land to grow cotton. Everyone agreed to deliver all the manure in seven days, and it was completed in five days. The same goes for planting trees. All 105 people in the village have planted 924 trees. Hu Fengxiang, a 63-year-old farmer in the village, said: "Now that our lives are better, don't forget how it came about. We can only preserve our good life by defeating the American devils' aggression. So I always think about going to the front to fight the American devils!"
    The farmers in our village also voluntarily donated 95,000 yuan RMB to help Korean refugees. Although the money is not much, our hearts are warm. The money was donated voluntarily, one thousand or another thousand.

    大家谈起对美帝国主义的仇恨
    生产的劲头儿就大起来了编辑同志：
    我村（山东省费县五区大安乡十万沟村）经过抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传，大家生产情绪都很高，对美帝国主义的仇恨更深了。
    为了启发群众的爱国热情，我村党员和干部们在一起开过会，在会上，我先谈了自己的历史和自己对抗美援朝的认识。我从小就受穷。父亲死了，两个妹妹卖给地主家当了丫头，共卖了五十斤豆子。三妹妹卖出去不久，就被地主打死了。幸亏共产党领导我们把日本鬼子和国民党打垮了，穷人才翻了身。现在美国鬼子又要来侵略我们，要让我们再回到国民党统治下的那种苦难里过日子，我对这件事情曾有过麻痹思想，没有用最大的努力来参加抗美援朝运动。在会上我做了检讨，并保证今后一定要努力生产，增强国防力量。我的意见说完以后，很多人都听得哭了。大家都说出了过去自身遭受的苦难，决心要保卫自己今天的好日子。被地主打得死过去又活过来的女党员赵士英说：“当初地主敢打我，我们没有力量反抗他，那就是因为那是国民党的世界，国民党就是美国鬼子给他撑的腰。这样说来，咱们不想再受地主的气，那就得打垮美国鬼子的侵略”。我们村的人民在村干部的领导下，时常谈这些道理，特别是谈起过去的苦处，大家就更加心爱现在的日子，干活的劲儿也就特别足。
    区人民政府希望我村能种三百亩地的棉花，我们为响应政府的号召，全村留下了三百六十亩田种棉花。大家商议好全村要在七天内送完粪，结果五天就送完了。栽树也是这样，全村一百零五个人已栽树九百二十四棵。村里六十三岁的老农民胡凤祥说：“咱们日子过好了，可不要忘了这是怎样来的。咱们只有打败美国鬼子的侵略才能把好日子保下来。所以我心里也总想着要到前方去和美国鬼子拚他两口肉下来呢！”
    我村农民还自动拿出九万五千元人民币，去救济朝鲜难民。钱虽不多，咱们的心可热着呢，这钱都是这个一千那个一千的自动拿的。
