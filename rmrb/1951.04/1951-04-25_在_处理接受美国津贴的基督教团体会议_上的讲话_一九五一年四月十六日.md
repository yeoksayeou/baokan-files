　　Speech at the "Conference on Handling Christian Groups Receiving American Subsidies"
　  April 16, 1951
    (Lu Dingyi, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government)
    The "Conference on Handling Christian Groups Receiving American Subsidies," convened by the Religious Affairs Department of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, opens today. The purpose of this conference is to encourage the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (self-government, self-support, and self-propagation) of Christianity, and to handle Christian groups receiving American subsidies, transforming them into groups completely managed by Chinese Christians themselves, based on the decision made by the Government Administration Council on December 29th of last year.

    Why did the Government Administration Council make the decision to handle religious groups receiving American subsidies? The reason for this was clearly stated in Vice Premier Guo Moruo's report on December 29th. First, because American imperialism uses huge sums of money to subsidize religious undertakings, controlling them to deceive and anesthetize the Chinese people, and to instill slavish ideology, which is one of the most insidious forms of cultural aggression. Second, because American imperialism constantly attempts to use the cultural institutions it subsidizes and controls, including religious groups, to spread rumors and slander against the people's New China, to publish and disseminate reactionary books and periodicals, and even to hide weapons and collude with Chiang Kai-shek's bandit secret agents to carry out espionage and sabotage activities. These activities have become even more active since the American imperialists invaded Korea and Taiwan, and the Chinese people's movement to resist America and aid Korea has been widely launched. Third, because the American government announced the freezing of our country's assets in the United States last December, attempting to use this method to increase the difficulties of the People's Government and threaten the livelihoods of all Chinese staff working in religious groups receiving American subsidies. Therefore, the People's Government has a responsibility to properly handle religious groups receiving American subsidies.

    As you all know, after the decision was issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on December 29th of last year, the Central People's Government and local People's Governments have convened many meetings to handle cultural, educational, and relief institutions receiving American subsidies, and all have achieved good results. The method adopted by the government is to convene all relevant parties when dealing with a problem, announce policies, discuss together, and then implement them. This time, regarding Christian groups receiving American subsidies, the Religious Affairs Department has drafted a draft plan for handling them, inviting representatives of Christian groups from all over the country to attend the meeting, discuss it together, and then submit it to the Government Administration Council for approval and implementation.

    Today's speech is divided into three parts: First, on patriotism; second, the conspiracy of American imperialism to use Christianity to carry out aggression against the world and against New China; and third, a few expectations for Chinese Christians.

  First, On Patriotism

    Handling Christian groups receiving American subsidies is by no means a technical issue; it is a struggle. The purpose of the struggle is to thoroughly eliminate the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression in our country over the past hundred years. To carry out such a struggle, patriotic Christians in religious groups need to unite with the government and work together under the guidance of the People's Government led by the Chinese Communist Party. To achieve this unity, a common political basis is needed. American imperialist elements in the church have been telling Chinese Christians that the Communist Party and religious people cannot have such a common basis because the Communist Party is materialist and religious people are idealist. It is true that the communist's worldview is materialist and the religious person's worldview is idealist, and these two worldviews are contradictory. Communists believe that dialectical materialism is the worldview of the Marxist-Leninist party, and that dialectical materialism and historical materialism are the theoretical foundations of communism. We also believe that Chinese communists and Chinese patriotic religious people, including Christians, have a basis for unity in politics, which is the great Common Program adopted by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This program was jointly approved by representatives of the Communist Party, representatives of religious circles, and representatives from all fields. On the basis of the Common Program, we can unite to do a good job in handling Christian groups receiving American subsidies, and to do a good job in eliminating the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression.

    Now let me read to you a few articles in the Common Program that are relevant to this conference:

    Preamble to the Common Program: "The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference unanimously agrees to take New Democracy, that is, People's Democracy, as the political basis of the People's Republic of China, and formulates the following Common Program, which shall be jointly observed by all units participating in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, all levels of People's Governments, and the people of the whole country."

    "Article 5: The people of the People's Republic of China have freedom of thought, speech, publication, assembly, association, communication, person, residence, movement, religious belief, and demonstration." The freedom of religious belief mentioned here means that for all people of New China, regardless of whether they support or oppose religion, regardless of what religion they believe in, the government shall not interfere.

    "Article 8: All citizens of the People's Republic of China have the obligation to defend the motherland, abide by the law, observe labor discipline, protect public property, perform public service and military service, and pay taxes." This means that, regardless of whether one is religious or non-religious, one has the above obligations, first and foremost the obligation to defend the motherland. One cannot be unpatriotic simply because one is religious or non-religious.

    "Article 42: The promotion of love for the motherland, love for the people, love for labor, love for science, and love for the protection of public property shall be the public morality of all citizens of the People's Republic of China." Religious and non-religious people alike have a responsibility to promote these virtues.

    "Article 7: The People's Republic of China must suppress all counter-revolutionary activities, severely punish all Kuomintang counter-revolutionary war criminals and other incorrigible counter-revolutionary ringleaders who collude with imperialism, betray the motherland, and oppose the people's democratic cause. For general reactionaries, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capitalists, after disarming them and eliminating their special power, their political rights must still be deprived according to law for a necessary period of time, but at the same time, a way out for life is given, and they are forced to reform themselves through labor to become new people. If they continue to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, they must be severely sanctioned." Helping the government suppress counter-revolutionaries is a responsibility shared by both religious and non-religious people.

    "Article 54: The principles of the foreign policy of the People's Republic of China are to safeguard the independence, freedom ,and integrity of territorial sovereignty of this country, uphold lasting international peace and friendly cooperation among the peoples of all countries, and oppose the policies of aggression and war of imperialism."

   "Article 41: The culture and education of the People's Republic of China are New Democratic, that is, national, scientific, and mass culture and education. The main task of the cultural and educational work of the People's Government shall be to raise the cultural level of the people, train talents for national construction, eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideologies, and develop ideas that serve the people."

    Gentlemen, from the Common Program, we can see that, apart from issues of worldview or religious belief, where the government shall not interfere with administrative orders, we have a common responsibility to unite and work together on many other issues. To say that we cannot find a common basis for unity and cooperation is just imperialist propaganda.

    Our worldviews are different, but we are all Chinese, we must all love our motherland, we must all oppose imperialism and reactionaries, and we must all fight for China's independence, democracy, peace, unity, prosperity, and strength.

    Every Chinese should love the motherland, and Chinese Christians also have a responsibility to love the country. We love our motherland, not only because we ourselves grew up in China, our ancestors were in China, and our children and grandchildren will also live in China; we love our motherland even more because today's China is already the people's own China, today's China is essentially different from the China of the past, and is more lovable than ever before.

    For nearly a hundred years, our country has been bullied by imperialism from the outside, reduced to a semi-colony, and oppressed by feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism from within, and the lives of the vast working people have been very painful. Patriotic people with lofty ideals, in order to liberate the motherland, stepped forward, one after another, and sacrificed themselves to struggle. By the time of this People's Liberation War, thanks to the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and thanks to the efforts of the people of the whole country, more than 8 million Kuomintang bandit troops were eliminated, completely thwarting the American imperialist conspiracy to monopolize China as a colony. The American imperialists' provision of 6 billion U.S. dollars in military aid to the Kuomintang bandit gang could not save the demise of the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The Chinese people have gained true liberation.

    In the year and a half since the founding of the people's New China, at home, except for Taiwan and Tibet, true political, military, and economic unity has been achieved; on the basis of the people's representative conferences, true democratic politics has been realized for the first time in the country; the phenomena of currency inflation and soaring prices, which the reactionaries had been unable to solve for twelve years, have been quickly curbed. The vast majority of bandits across the country have been eliminated. Transportation has been restored, and railways and highways are unimpeded, and one can travel directly from Manchuria to Guangdong and Guangxi. The total length of railways open to traffic in the country is more than 26,000 kilometers, while in 1936 it was only 11,000 kilometers (excluding the railways of the puppet Manchuria at that time); the total length of highways open to traffic is more than 100,000 kilometers, while in 1936 it was only 60,000 kilometers. Rent reduction and interest reduction and land reform have been implemented in the vast newly liberated areas. Land reform has been implemented in areas with a population of approximately 140 million people this past winter and spring. Together with the old liberated areas where land reform has already been implemented, land reform has been implemented in areas with a total population of 300 million people. The peasants there have been freed from the oppression and exploitation of feudal landlords, their lives have been improved, and their productivity and enthusiasm for production have also increased. Last year, the production of grain and cotton was already close to the pre-war level, and this year we are striving to exceed the pre-war level. Water conservancy projects have been greatly developed, and this year we will begin to fundamentally manage the Huai River, which has suffered from disasters nine years out of ten. The customs, which had always been managed by foreigners, have been truly recovered and are being managed very well. Domestic and foreign trade has been restored and developed. Domestic trade is now focused on developing exchanges between urban and rural areas, thus both rural and urban production have broad markets; in terms of foreign trade, despite the imperialists' best efforts to obstruct it, the volume of import and export trade in 1950 still exceeded any year in the past twenty years, and there was a trade surplus for the first time in seventy-three years, with the surplus accounting for 9.34 percent of the total value of imports. The People's Government has adjusted the relationship between public and private economies, enabling public and private production undertakings to flourish. In addition, the great famine of the previous year was overcome, unemployment was relieved, various epidemics were prevented and suppressed, and cultural education was popularized among the vast workers and peasants. According to incomplete statistics, more than one million workers and staff members across the country have participated in amateur school studies, and 25 million peasants have joined winter schools last year. Poisonous American films have been completely squeezed out of the market. No government in the old China has ever done so much for the people in such a short period of time.

    The Chinese people's victory is not limited to these. One of the greatest victories of the Chinese people is the assistance to the Korean people in defeating the American imperialist aggression against Korea, thereby defending our great motherland. This victory has already forced the enemy chieftain MacArthur to step down. The victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army over American imperialism proves the strength of the Chinese people and the world's peace and democracy camp, and proves that American imperialism and all imperialism are nothing more than paper tigers. Due to these achievements and victories, our country is unprecedentedly strong, and its position and prestige in the world are unprecedentedly enhanced. Our country has signed a treaty of friendship, alliance, and mutual assistance with the Soviet Union, and the union of these two major powers has become an invincible force in the world.

    Can any Chinese people not feel excited and proud of the strength of their motherland? Can they say that such a motherland is not lovable? All kind-hearted Chinese people must love the glorious and great New China.

    Of course, our love for our motherland cannot violate the Common Program and go on to love those who are enemies of the motherland. Imperialism oppressed us for a hundred years, and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang oppressed us for more than twenty years, and they are still dreaming of riding on the heads of the Chinese people again. We have only hatred for them. American imperialism invades Korea and Taiwan, attempts to rearm Japan to attack our country, and attempts to provoke a third world war, we must resolutely oppose it. And we are fully confident that the Chinese people will certainly win, and the forces of world peace will certainly win.

    The vast majority of Christian believers are patriotic. Some Christians have been beaten and imprisoned by the Kuomintang bandit gang in the past for the sake of patriotism. These patriots are glorious. In September of last year, Christians led by Mr. Wu Yaozong issued "The Path of Efforts by Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China," proposing a Three-Self Patriotic Movement with the aim of eliminating imperialist influence within Christianity, which is a declaration of patriotism. The People's Government supports and encourages this patriotic proposition.

  Second, The Conspiracy of American Imperialism to Use Christianity to Carry Out Aggression
        Against the World and Against New China

    Christianity was originally a European religion. The spread of Christianity outside Europe began in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. At that time, the capitalist suzerain states all took their own colonies as missionary targets, but excluded the import of Christianity into other countries. In our country, these invaders also preached in their respective spheres of influence. American pastor Bridgman once confessed without being beaten: "We who preach in China do so more for political reasons than for religious reasons." After the mid-nineteenth century, as capitalism developed into imperialism, British and American imperialists wanted to use religion as a tool to invade the whole world. At the same time, in order to ease the conflicts between various churches, under the initiative of the American Mott, they developed the "Ecumenical Movement" and the "World-Wide Evangelistic Movement", and established "Christian Councils" in various countries. The "National Christian Council of China" was also established in China in 1922, which was an organization controlled by British and American imperialism. In addition, international Christian organizations such as the "World Student Christian Federation," "World Alliance of Young Men's Christian Associations," "World Young Women's Christian Association," "World Sunday School Association" (now renamed "World Council of Christian Education"), and "United Bible Societies" were also established. Mott once raised more than 300 million US dollars, which were used to develop these groups. The main donors were American capitalists such as Rockefeller and Hearst, the boss of the yellow newspaper trust.

    Although there were these international organizations, before the Second World War, the international Christian missionary system still had three major groups: first, the United States, second, Britain, and third, the countries of Northwestern Europe, which competed with each other. After the Second World War, the United States became the number one imperialist country, and countries such as Britain and France were reduced to second and third-rate countries. American imperialism also seized the dominant leadership position in the international missionary cause. American imperialism further controlled various Christian international organizations in order to use religion as its tool of aggression to dominate the world. The "World Council of Churches" (also translated as the World Christian Church Association), which was established in the capital of the Netherlands in August 1948, flaunts the so-called "universal" or "global" "Ecumenical Movement," and this organization was entirely produced under the direct support of American imperialism.

    During the preparation process of this council, the American financial giant Rockefeller once donated 500,000 US dollars as funding for training anti-communist religious cadres. The notorious American war monger Dulles personally attended the inaugural meeting of this council and served as one of the chairmen of the council's International Affairs Committee. As everyone knows, the war monger Dulles advocated uniting with German and Japanese fascists to attack the Soviet Union and invade China during the Second World War. He is now a "advisor" to the US State Department and is the actual leader of American imperialist foreign policy.

    This "World Council of Churches," which flaunts the "Christian Ecumenical Movement," held a meeting in Canada in early July last year and passed a "Resolution on the Korean War." This resolution was published in August 1950 in the publication (Christianity and Crisis) published by Union Theological Seminary in New York, USA. Its main contents are two points: First, it slanders the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and supports the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea, saying that "the attack was launched by North Korea" and "demanding that the United Nations, which requires to maintain world order, immediately decide to face up to this act of aggression and authorize all member states to support the police bill." Second, it opposes the Stockholm Declaration banning atomic weapons. As everyone knows, this declaration has more than 500 million signatories worldwide, and more than 200 million signatories in China, but the "World Council of Churches" opposes this declaration and prohibits Christians from signing this peace declaration. Is supporting the American imperialist aggression against Korea and opposing the ban on atomic weapons a "super-political" issue of religious belief? Obviously not, this is obviously a political proposition, a political proposition of American imperialists. It can be seen that the "World Council of Churches" is a tool of aggression of American imperialism, and the so-called "Christian Ecumenical Movement" is a guise for American imperialism to use Christianity to invade the world, and is incompatible with the patriotism of the Chinese people.

    After the Second World War, in order to use Christianity to carry out cultural aggression in order to annex the world, American imperialism, in addition to organizing the "World Council of Churches," also strengthened and expanded sectarian international organizations, such as the "Lutheran World Federation," "Baptist World Alliance," and existing Christian international organizations, such as the "World Alliance of Young Men's Christian Associations," "World Young Women's Christian Association," "International Missionary Council," and "World Council of Christian Education." Eighty percent of the funding for all these international Christian organizations comes from the United States. American imperialism is particularly concerned about Asia. The "World Alliance of Young Men's Christian Associations," "International Missionary Council," "World Council of Churches," and "World Council of Christian Education," all controlled by American imperialism, have sent regional secretaries stationed in Asia. Furthermore, a series of conferences were held in Asia, such as the "World Student Christian Federation" holding the "Asian Leaders Conference" in Ceylon in December 1948, the "World Alliance of Young Men's Christian Associations" holding the "Southeast Asian YMCA Leaders Conference" in Bangkok in August 1949, and the "World Young Women's Christian Association" holding the "General Council" in Hangzhou in 1947, with war criminal Soong Mei-ling as the main speaker. In November 1949, the "Asia General Secretaries' Workshop" was held in Bangkok, and later the "Asia Leaders Training Conference" was held in India. The "World Council of Churches" and the "International Missionary Council" held the "Southeast Asian Christian Conference" in Bangkok in December 1949. These conferences all discussed communism as a serious "problem," "threat," or "challenge." They did not mention a word about the common enemy of mankind, American imperialism, its acts of aggression, and its new plans for a world war.

    Many of the Chinese Christian groups receiving American subsidies are directly related to the "China Committee of the Foreign Missions Conference of North America." Chinese Christian groups receiving subsidies from other countries are now also indirectly related to the United States.

    The July issue of the Chinese Christian Church National General Assembly's newsletter published the May 8 "Letter from the China Committee of the Foreign Missions Conference of North America to Certain Chinese Christians." From this letter, we can see the American imperialist policy of continuing to carry out cultural aggression against China after the founding of New China. This letter was signed by Americans Galen Weaver, Farrar, Bagg, Mills, Edith Showers, and Ku Ching-lan. In the letter, they said to "certain Chinese Christians" who wrote to them: "Your joint letter to us this time is of inestimable value." "When we read again the names of those who signed this joint letter, all of whom have long been in our remembrance and are very enthusiastic about our common cause as Christian friends, our hearts remember that in the universal prayer fellowship, we have a constant, lasting, and inseparable connection with you." New China is independent, liberated, and has a bright future, and patriotic Christians are very excited, but this letter sadly says, "We must re-shoulder the cross of enduring hardship and self-sacrifice." This letter instructed these "Christian friends of the common cause": "You are now striving to create a new way to give Caesar what is Caesar's, and God what is God's," that is, to use religion as a cloak and secretly collude with American imperialism to resist the People's Government. This letter promised to donate funds in the economic aspect to "help the Chinese church without causing any harm," that is, to change the way of open subsidies to secret subsidies, and this way of secret subsidies is undoubtedly bribery. For the National Christian Council of China, they were willing to "continue to provide the highest amount of subsidy," "the council hopes to give this subsidy whenever it is needed"; "Christian texts and the promotion of rural churches, etc., can all use donations from foreign churches." Regarding church schools, hospitals, and other Christian institutions, the letter stated that they would "enthusiastically support" them. Regarding foreigners coming to China to preach, the letter stated, "We believe that our missionaries are prepared and willing to serve under these circumstances (referring to the conditions of New China)."

    From the letter of the "China Committee of the Foreign Missions Conference of North America," we can see: First, after the founding of New China, American imperialists, because their aggression in politics, military, and economic aspects has failed, are desperately trying to maintain their cultural aggression strongholds in China, and are more concerned about using Christianity to carry out cultural aggression and espionage activities. Second, under the guise of the so-called "universal fellowship," they are trying to buy off Chinese Christians, oppose the Chinese church's Three-Self Patriotic Movement, and resist the People's Government.

    The above facts show that using Christianity to carry out cultural aggression is an important component of the American imperialist policy of aggression. Behind the so-called Christian "universality" or "globality" is the bloody claws of American imperialism, preparing for a war of aggression against New China, and preparing for a "universal" massacre. This situation deserves deep vigilance from the Chinese people, especially Christians.

    There is no doubt that the majority of Christians in the United States and other foreign countries are working people, and there are good people among the leaders of the churches. We must unite with them to oppose imperialism and fight for world peace. However, there is also no doubt that the existing Christian international organizations and the "Foreign Missions Conference of North America," as well as the American missions in our country, are all tools of aggression of American imperialism. Precisely because this is a political issue rather than a matter of faith, the People's Government must intervene in the issue of the relationship between Chinese Christian groups and foreign Christian groups in order to ensure the safety of the country. Christians also have a responsibility to assist the government in this matter.

    In the conspiracy to carry out cultural aggression against China, imperialists have always colluded with the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary bandit gang. American imperialist Biven Yu, who was disguised as a missionary, had the closest relationship with the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary bandit gang. He had served as an advisor to Chiang Kai-shek and drafted anti-communist and anti-people "education plans" for Chiang Kai-shek. The "New Life Movement" formerly advocated by the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek was closely related to the imperialist missionary activities in our country. Patriotic Christians should pay attention to the imperialist elements lurking in Christian groups, the die-hard imperialist running dogs, and the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary bandit gang elements, and should assist the government in exposing them.

  Third, Expectations for Christians

    We hope that Chinese Christians will stand under the banner of anti-imperialism and patriotism, unite with the People's Government on the basis of the great Common Program, and work together under the guidance of the People's Government to build a new China.

    (1) There are currently three major movements underway across the country, namely, resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. We hope that Chinese Christians will actively support and participate in these three movements. The purpose of resisting America and aiding Korea is to give our country an international environment in which we can peacefully build, because if our country is under the threat of imperialist armed attack, there is no possibility of carrying out peaceful construction. Resisting America and aiding Korea is also for the sake of striving for world peace, and opposing the American imperialist war policy and policy of aggression. In order to achieve victory in resisting America and aiding Korea, in addition to the heroic People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fighting on the front lines, a lot of work must be done in the rear. One of these tasks is to spread the propaganda of resisting America and aiding Korea to every place and every person. Among Christians, special attention must be paid to eliminating the ideas of fear of America, worship of America, and flattering of America, and establishing ideas of hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialism. The purpose of land reform is to eliminate the feudal land ownership system, increase the production enthusiasm of the peasants who account for 80% of the population, develop agricultural production, and improve the lives of the peasants. Only by doing this can our country's industry develop smoothly. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the removal of pests such as spies, bandits, bullies, and counter-revolutionaries who do not know how to repent is the pressing task of consolidating national defense, protecting production, and stabilizing social order. Christians have a responsibility to assist the government in exposing these counter-revolutionaries, especially counter-revolutionaries such as Gu Renen who are disguised as religious people.

    (2) The declaration of "The Path of Efforts by Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China" has been signed by 180,000 people, which is good. This signature movement must continue to be expanded among Christians. But more importantly, it is necessary to realize the self-government, self-support, and self-propagation of Christian groups in practice, not just in words. First of all, church groups receiving American subsidies must immediately accomplish this task. The People's Government will definitely encourage and help you to do so. The "Draft Measures for Handling Christian Groups Receiving American Subsidies" drafted by the Religious Affairs Department of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council is for this purpose.

    Let the patriotic Christians and the People's Government unite more closely, work together, and build our motherland stronger and more prosperous!

    (Editor's note: The joint declaration and signature list of representatives of various churches and groups of Chinese Christianity, and the speeches of the representatives attending the conference on handling Christian groups receiving American subsidies, denouncing the crimes of imperialist elements and scum in the church, can be found on pages five and six of this newspaper today).

　　在“处理接受美国津贴的基督教团体会议”上的讲话
　  一九五一年四月十六日
    （中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会副主任陆定一）
    中央人民政府政务院文教委员会宗教事务处召集的“处理接受美国津贴的基督教团体会议”今天开幕了。这个会议的目的，是根据政务院去年十二月二十九日决定，鼓励基督教的自治、自养、自传运动，处理接受美国津贴的基督教团体，使之变成为中国教徒完全自办的团体。
    政务院为什么要作出决定，处理接受美国津贴的宗教团体？这个理由，在十二月二十九日郭沫若副总理的报告中，已经说得很明白。第一，因为美国帝国主义以巨额款项津贴宗教事业，加以控制，来进行对中国人民的欺骗、麻醉，和灌输奴化思想，是恶毒的文化侵略方式之一。第二，因为美国帝国主义不断地企图利用它所津贴和控制的文化机关，包括宗教团体在内，对人民的新中国进行造谣、诽谤，出版和散布反动书刊，甚至隐藏武器，勾结蒋匪特务，进行间谍和破坏活动。这种活动，在美帝国主义侵略朝鲜、台湾以后，中国人民抗美援朝运动广泛开展的时候，更加活跃起来。第三，因为美国政府在去年十二月宣布冻结我国在美国的财产，企图用这个办法来增加人民政府的困难，威胁所有在接受美国津贴的宗教团体中全部中国工作人员的生活。因此，人民政府对于接受美国津贴的宗教团体，就有责任予以妥善的处理。
    各位知道，在中央人民政府政务院去年十二月二十九日决定发布之后，中央人民政府和地方人民政府已经召集过多次会议，处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关，都得到良好的结果。政府所采取的方法，就是在处理一个问题时，召集所有有关方面，宣布政策，共同商讨，然后施行。此次对于接受美国津贴的基督教团体，宗教事务处已经起草了一个处理办法的草案，邀请全国的基督教团体代表来开会，共同讨论，然后呈请政务院批准实施。
    今天的讲话，分三部分：第一，关于爱国主义；第二，美国帝国主义利用基督教进行侵略全世界和侵略新中国的阴谋；第三，对中国基督教徒的几点期望。
  第一，关于爱国主义
    处理接受美国津贴的基督教团体，这决不是一个技术性的问题，这是一个斗争。斗争的目的是彻底肃清一百多年来美帝国主义对我国的文化侵略的影响。要进行这样一个斗争，需要宗教团体的爱国教徒与政府团结起来，在以中国共产党为领导的人民政府的指导之下，共同努力。为了达到这个团结，需要有政治上的共同基础。教会里的美国帝国主义分子一直在向中国教徒说，共产党与宗教徒是不能有这样的共同基础的，因为共产党是唯物主义者，宗教徒是唯心主义者。不错，共产党员的世界观是唯物主义的，宗教徒的世界观是唯心主义的，这两种世界观是相反的。共产主义者认为，辩证唯物主义是马克思列宁主义党的世界观，辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义是共产主义的理论基础。我们又认为，中国的共产党员与中国的爱国的宗教徒，包括基督教徒在内，在政治上是有团结的基础的，这就是人民政治协商会议所通过的伟大的共同纲领，这个纲领是共产党的代表和宗教界的代表和各方面的代表在一起，共同举手通过的。在共同纲领的基础上，我们能够团结起来，把处理接受美国津贴的基督教团体的事情做好，把肃清美国帝国主义文化侵略影响的事情做好。
    现在让我把共同纲领中与此次会议有关的几条，向大家宣读：
    共同纲领序言：“中国人民政治协商会议一致同意以新民主主义即人民民主主义为中华人民共和国的政治基础，并制定以下的共同纲领，凡参加人民政治协商会议的各单位、各级人民政府和全国人民均应共同遵守。”
    “第五条：中华人民共和国人民有思想、言论、出版、集会、结社、通讯、人身、居住、迁徙、宗教信仰及示威游行的自由权。”这里所说的宗教信仰的自由权，就是凡属新中国的人民，不管他赞成或反对宗教，不管他信仰什么宗教，政府不得干涉。
    “第八条：中华人民共和国国民均有保卫祖国、遵守法律、遵守劳动纪律、爱护公共财产、应征公役兵役和缴纳赋税的义务。”这就是说，不论宗教徒与非宗教徒，都有上述的义务，首先是保卫祖国的义务。不能因为做了宗教徒或非宗教徒，就可以不爱国。
    “第四十二条：提倡爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物为中华人民共和国全体国民的公德。”这些公德，教徒与非教徒都有责任去提倡。
    “第七条：中华人民共和国必须镇压一切反革命活动，严厉惩罚一切勾结帝国主义、背叛祖国、反对人民民主事业的国民党反革命战争罪犯和其他怙恶不悛的反革命首要分子。对于一般的反动分子、封建地主、官僚资本家，在解除其武装、消灭其特殊势力后，仍须依法在必要时期内剥夺他们的政治权利，但同时给以生活出路，并强迫他们在劳动中改造自己，成为新人。假如他们继续进行反革命活动，必须予以严厉的制裁。”帮助政府镇压反革命，不论教徒和非教徒都有同样的责任。
    “第五十四条：中华人民共和国外交政策的原则，为保障本国独立、自由和领土主权的完整，拥护国际的持久和平和各国人民间的友好合作，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。”
    “第四十一条：中华人民共和国的文化教育为新民主主义的，即民族的、科学的、大众的文化教育。人民政府的文化教育工作，应以提高人民文化水平，培养国家建设人才，肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，发展为人民服务的思想为主要任务。”
    各位先生们，从共同纲领里，我们可以看见，除了在世界观的问题或宗教信仰的问题上，政府不得用行政命令干涉外，在许许多多其他的问题上，我们有共同责任团结起来一致努力的。说我们之间找不到团结合作的共同基础，那只是帝国主义者的造谣罢了。
    我们的世界观不同，但我们都是中国人，都要爱祖国，都要反对帝国主义和反动派，都要为中国的独立、民主、和平、统一、富强而斗争。
    每一个中国人都应该爱祖国，中国的基督教徒也有责任爱国。我们爱祖国，不但因为我们自己生长在中国，我们的祖先在中国，我们的子子孙孙也将居住在中国；我们爱祖国，更因为今天的中国已经是人民自己的中国，今天的中国和过去的中国已有本质上的不同，而比任何时候都更加可爱了。
    我国近百年来，外受帝国主义的欺侮，沦为半殖民地，国内有封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫，广大劳动人民的生活非常痛苦。爱国志士为了祖国的解放，前仆后继，牺牲奋斗。到了这次人民解放战争，由于毛主席和共产党的领导，由于全国人民的努力，消灭了八百余万国民党匪军，使美帝国主义独占中国为殖民地的阴谋完全失败，美帝国主义给与国民党匪帮六十万万美元的军事援助，丝毫不能挽救帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义反动统治的灭亡。中国人民得到真正的解放。
    人民的新中国建国一年半以来，在国内，除了台湾西藏以外，实现了政治、军事、经济上的真正统一；在人民代表会议的基础上，全国第一次实现了真正的民主政治；十二年来反动派所无法解决的通货膨胀与物价高涨的现象迅速制止了。全国的土匪极大部分肃清了。交通恢复，铁路公路畅通无阻，从满洲里可以直达广东广西。全国铁路通车的有二万六千多公里，而一九三六年只有一万一千公里（不包括当时伪满的铁路）；公路通车的有十万多公里，而一九三六年只有六万多公里。在广大的新解放地区实行了减租减息和土地改革，去冬今春约有一亿四千万人口的地区实行了土地改革，加上已经实行土地改革的老解放区，共有三万万人口的地区实行了土地改革，那里的农民摆脱了封建地主的压迫与剥削，生活改善了，生产力和生产的积极性也跟着提高了。去年粮食和棉花的生产已经接近战前的水平，今年正在争取超过战前的水平。水利事业大发展，今年开始要把十年九灾的淮河加以根本治理。向来由外国人管理的海关真正收回了，而且办得很好。国内外的贸易恢复而且发展了，国内的贸易现在着重于发展城乡交流，因而农村和城市的生产都有了广阔的市场；对外贸易方面，尽管帝国主义竭力阻碍，但一九五○年进出口贸易量还是超过了近二十年的任何一年，并且出现了七十三年来未曾有过的出超，出超占进口总值的百分之九·三四。人民政府调整了公私经济之间的关系，使公私生产事业欣欣向荣。此外，克服了前年的大灾荒，救济了失业，防止和扑灭了各种疫病，向广大工农普及了文化教育。据不完全的统计，全国已有一百多万职工参加业余学校学习，有二千五百万农民入了去年的冬学。有毒素的美国影片已经在市场上完全被排挤出去。旧中国的任何政府，从来没有在这样短的时间里，替人民做出这样多的事情来。
    中国人民的胜利还不止这些。中国人民的最大的胜利之一，是援助朝鲜人民击败了美帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略，从而保卫了我们的伟大祖国。这个胜利已经迫使敌酋麦克阿瑟下台。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军对美帝国主义的胜利，证明了中国人民和世界和平民主阵营力量的强大，证明美帝国主义和一切帝国主义不过是纸老虎。由于这些成就和胜利，我们的国家是空前的强大了，在世界上的地位和威信是空前的提高了。我国和苏联订立了友好同盟互助条约，这两个大国的联合，成了世界上不可战胜的力量。
    凡是中国人民，对于自己的祖国的强大，能够不感到兴奋和骄傲吗？能够说这样的祖国不可爱吗？凡是善良的中国人一定热爱光荣伟大的新中国。
    我们爱祖国，当然不能违背共同纲领，去爱那些祖国的敌人。帝国主义压迫了我们一百年，蒋介石匪帮压迫了我们二十多年，他们现在还在梦想再骑到中国人民的头上来。我们对于他们，只有仇恨。美帝国主义侵略朝鲜、台湾，企图重新武装日本来进攻我国，企图挑起第三次世界大战，我们一定要坚决反对。而且我们完全有信心，中国人民一定胜利，世界和平的力量一定胜利。
    基督教的信徒中，最大多数是爱国的。有些教徒过去为了爱国，受过国民党匪帮的殴打与监禁。这些爱国者是光荣的。去年九月，以吴耀宗先生为首的基督教徒，发表了“中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径”，提出了以肃清基督教内帝国主义影响为目的的自治、自养、自传的运动，这是一个爱国主义的宣言。人民政府对于这种爱国的主张，是予以支持和鼓励的。
  第二，美国帝国主义利用基督教进行侵略全世界和侵略新中国的
        阴谋
    基督教原来是欧洲的宗教。基督教的传布到欧洲以外，是十六、七世纪开始的。当时各资本主义宗主国，都以自己的殖民地为传教对象，但对其他国家基督教的输入，则予以排斥。在我国，这些侵略者也各在自己的势力范围内传教。美国牧师裨治文曾经不打自招地说：“我等在中国传教之人，与其说是由于宗教的原因，毋宁说是由于政治的原因。”到了十九世纪中叶以后，资本主义发展成为帝国主义，英美帝国主义者想以宗教为工具，侵略全世界，同时为了缓和各教会间的冲突，所以在美国人穆德的主动下，发展了“教会合一运动”，“全世界前进宣教运动”，在各国成立“基督教协进会”，在中国也于一九二二年成立了“中华全国基督教协进会”，这是由英美帝国主义控制的机关。此外，还成立了“世界基督教学生同盟”、“基督教青年会世界协会”、“世界基督教女青年会”、“世界主日学总会”（现改为“世界基督教教育协会”）、“联合圣经公会”等国际性的基督教团体。穆德曾一手募捐过三亿以上的美金，用于发展这些团体。主要的捐助者，是美国大资本家洛克斐勒和黄色报纸托辣斯的老板赫斯脱等。
    虽然有了这些国际性的团体，可是在第二次世界大战以前，国际基督教的传教系统仍有三大集团，第一是美国，其次是英国，再次是西北欧各国，彼此抗衡。到了第二次世界大战以后，美国成为第一号帝国主义国家，英法等国降为第二第三等的国家，美帝国主义在国际传教事业上也夺得了独占的领导地位。美国帝国主义进一步地控制了各个基督教国际团体，以便利用宗教作为它的侵略工具，来独霸全世界。一九四八年八月在荷兰京城成立的“世界基督教协进会”（又译作世界基督教会协会），标榜所谓“普世性”或“世界性”的“教会合一运动”，这个团体就完全是在美帝国主义的直接支持下产生的。
    这个协进会，在筹备过程中，曾由美国金融巨头洛克斐勒一次捐助了五十万元美金，作为训练反共宗教干部的经费。著名的美国战争贩子杜勒斯，亲自出席了这个协进会的成立大会，并且担任了该协进会的国际事务委员会主席之一。大家知道，战争贩子杜勒斯，在第二次世界大战时是主张联合德日法西斯，进攻苏联和侵略中国的，现在是美国国务院的“顾问”，是美国帝国主义外交政策的实际领导人。
    这个标榜“基督教普世运动”的“世界基督教协进会”，去年七月初在加拿大开会，通过了一个“对于朝鲜战争的决议”。这个决议曾于一九五○年八月刊载在美国纽约协和神学院出版的刊物（基督教与危机）上。其内容主要有两点：第一，诬蔑朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，拥护美帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略战争，说“攻击是由北朝鲜发动的”，“要求维持世界秩序的联合国立即决定正视这种侵略行为，并授权予各会员国均应支持警察法案”。第二，反对斯德哥尔摩禁止原子武器的宣言，大家知道，这个宣言在全世界上有五万万以上的签名者，在全中国有二万万以上的签名者，但是“世界基督教协进会”却反对这个宣言，并禁止基督教徒在这个和平宣言上签名。赞成美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，和反对禁止原子武器，这是“超政治”的宗教信仰问题么？显然不是，这显然是政治主张，是美国帝国主义者的政治主张。可以看出，“世界基督教协进会”是美国帝国主义的侵略工具，所谓“基督教普世运动”是美帝国主义利用基督教侵略全世界的幌子，与中国人民的爱国主义不能相容。
    第二次世界大战后，美国帝国主义为了利用基督教进行文化侵略，以便并吞世界，除了组织“世界基督教协进会”以外，还加强和扩大了宗派性的国际组织，如“世界信义宗联合会”、“世界浸礼会联盟”，以及原有的基督教国际团体，如“基督教青年会世界协会”、“世界基督教女青年会”、“国际宣教协会”、和“世界基督教教育协会”等。所有这些国际性的基督教团体，经费的百分之八十都来自美国。对于亚洲，美帝国主义是特别关心的。美国帝国主义所控制的“基督教青年会世界协会”“国际宣教协会”“世界基督教协进会”“世界基督教教育协会”都派了专驻亚洲的区干事。再则，在亚洲举行了一连串的会议，如“世界基督教学生同盟”于一九四八年十二月在锡兰举行“亚洲领袖会议”，“基督教青年会世界协会”于一九四九年八月在曼谷举行“东南亚青年会领袖会议”，“世界基督教女青年会”则于一九四七年在杭州举行了“全体理事会”，由战犯宋美龄为主要讲员，一九四九年十一月又在曼谷举行“亚洲总干事工作会”，后来又在印度举行“亚洲领袖训练会”，“世界基督教协进会”及“国际宣教协会”于一九四九年十二月在曼谷举行“东南亚基督教会议”。这些会议，都把共产主义作为严重的“问题”“威胁”或“挑战”来讨论。对于世界人类的公敌美国帝国主义及其侵略行为和新的世界大战计划则一字不提。
    中国的接受美国津贴的基督教团体，有许多是与美国的“北美基督教差会联合会中国委员会”直接发生关系的。在中国的接受其他国家津贴的基督教团体，现在也会间接同美国发生关系了。
    中华基督教会全国总会去年七月号的会报上发表了五月八日“北美基督教差会联合会中国委员会复中国某些基督教徒的信”，从这封信里可以看出美国帝国主义在新中国成立后对中国继续进行文化侵略的方针。这封信由美国人葛惠良、法乐尔、包巴格、密尔士、施懿秀、寇清岚签名。他们在信里对写信去的“某些中国教徒”说：“你们这次写给我们的联名信，是具有不可估计的价值”。“当我们再念过签署此次联名信的各位的姓名，他们都是久在我们怀念之中和非常热忱于我们共同主义的基督徒朋友，我们心中就记起在普世祈祷团契之中，我们对于你们有一种经常持久而不可分离的联系。”新中国是独立了，解放了，有光明的前途，爱国的基督教徒都很兴奋，但这封信却悲哀地说，“我们要重新背起忍受困苦和自我牺牲的十字架。”这封信指示这些“共同主义的基督徒朋友”说：“你们现在努力去造出一种新的方式，以该撒的物还给该撒，上帝的物还给上帝”，就是说，以宗教为外衣，暗地里勾结美帝国主义反抗人民政府。这封信答应在经济方面，愿意捐款“帮助中国教会，而不至有所贻害”，就是说，改变公开津贴的方式为秘密津贴，这种秘密津贴的方式，毫无疑义，就是收买。对于中华全国基督教协进会，愿意“继续以最高额的补助费”供给，“该会希望此项补助费到何时，即给到何时”；“基督教文字和促进乡村教会等，都可利用国外教会的捐款”。对于教会学校、医院、及其他基督教机关，该信表示要“热心赞助”。对于外国人来中国传教，该信表示“我们相信，我们的宣教师准备愿在这些情形（指新中国的条件）之下来服务。”
    从“北美基督教差会联合会中国委员会”的信里，我们可以看到：第一、在新中国成立之后，美国帝国主义者因为在政治、军事、经济各方面的侵略都失败了，拼命企图保持它在中国的文化侵略据点，对于利用基督教来进行文化侵略和间谍活动是更加关心了。第二、在所谓“普世团契”的幌子下，企图收买中国基督教徒，反对中国教会自治、自养、自传的革新运动，和反抗人民政府。
    以上的事实表明，利用基督教来进行文化侵略，这是美国帝国主义侵略政策的重要组成部分之一。在所谓基督教“普世性”或“世界性”口号的背后，是美国帝国主义血淋淋的魔掌，在准备反对新中国的侵略战争，并且准备“普世性”的大屠杀。这种情形，值得中国人民尤其是基督教徒深深警惕。
    毫无疑问，美国和其他外国的基督教徒里，大多数是劳动人民，教会的领袖中也有好人，我们是要同他们联合起来反对帝国主义，为世界和平而奋斗的。但是，现有的基督教国际团体和“北美基督教差会联合会”之类，以及在我国的美国差会，都是美帝国主义的侵略工具，这一点也是毫无疑问的。正因为这是一个政治问题而不是信仰问题，所以人民政府对于中国基督教团体与外国基督教团体关系的问题，必须过问，以保障国家的安全。基督教徒也有责任在这件事情上协助政府。
    在对中国进行文化侵略的阴谋中，帝国主义者向来是与国民党反革命匪帮勾结一起的。披着传教外衣的美国帝国主义分子毕范宇，是与国民党反革命匪帮关系最密切的，他曾经做过蒋匪的顾问，替蒋匪起草过反共反人民的“教育计划”。匪首蒋介石从前所提倡的“新生活运动”，是与帝国主义在我国的传教活动有密切关系的。爱国的基督教徒，应该注意潜伏在基督教团体中的帝国主义分子，死心塌地的帝国主义走狗，和国民党反革命匪帮分子，应该协助政府来揭露他们。
  第三，对基督教徒的期望
    我们希望，中国的基督教徒站到反帝爱国的旗帜之下，在伟大的共同纲领的基础之上，与人民政府团结起来，在人民政府的指导之下，共同努力，建设新中国。
    （一）现在全国有三个大运动正在进行，即抗美援朝、土地改革、和镇压反革命。希望中国基督教徒积极拥护和参加这三个运动。抗美援朝的目的，是使我国有一个可以和平建设的国际环境，因为如果我们的国家处在帝国主义武装进攻的威胁之下，就没有可能进行和平建设。抗美援朝同时也为了争取世界和平，反对美国帝国主义的战争政策与侵略政策。为了取得抗美援朝的胜利，除了英勇的人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军在前线作战以外，在后方要做很多工作，这些工作之一，就是把抗美援朝的宣传达到每处每人，在教徒中特别要注意肃清恐美、崇美、媚美的思想，建立对美国帝国主义仇视、鄙视、蔑视的思想。土地改革的目的，是消灭封建的土地所有制，提高占人口百分之八十的农民的生产热情，发展农业生产，改善农民生活，只有这样做了，我国的工业才能顺畅发展。镇压反革命，对于特务、土匪、恶霸和不知改悔的反革命分子等害虫的清除，是巩固国防，保护生产，安定社会秩序的当务之急，教徒有责任来协助政府揭发这些反革命分子，特别是披着宗教外衣的象顾仁恩这类的反革命分子。
    （二）“中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径”宣言，签名者已达十八万人，这是好的。必须继续在基督教徒中扩大这个签名运动。但更重要的，是要在实际上而不仅在口头上实现基督教团体的自治、自养、自传。首先是接受美国津贴的教会团体，必须立即做到这个任务。人民政府是一定鼓励你们、帮助你们这样做的。此次由政务院文教委员会宗教事务处所拟的“处理接受美国津贴的基督教团体办法草案”，就是为了这个目的。
    爱国的基督教徒与人民政府更加亲密的团结起来，共同努力，把我们的祖国建设得更强大更富裕吧！
