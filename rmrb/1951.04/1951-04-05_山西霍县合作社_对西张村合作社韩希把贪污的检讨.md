Column: Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editors:

The article by Comrade Ya Nan published in the People's Daily on February 27th in the "Readers' Letters" column, criticizing the embezzlement and dereliction of duty by Han Xiba, the purchasing agent of the Xizhang Village Cooperative in Huo County, Shanxi Province, is completely correct. Since becoming the purchasing agent of the cooperative, Han Xiba has displayed a lax and corrupt lifestyle, lacking the thought of serving the members. Our county cooperative should also bear some responsibility for the occurrence of this incident. For example, we knew that the village cooperative sent Han Xiba to Shijiazhuang to buy a cotton ginning machine for profit-seeking purposes, but we did not stop it. We also failed to instruct them on how to handle the fact that the cooperative went to Shijiazhuang to purchase goods without asking for instructions from higher authorities. This shows that we have not fulfilled our due responsibilities. From this incident, we have also examined that the business connection between our county cooperative and the village cooperative is insufficient, and we have not paid enough attention to the education of cooperative cadres. For this reason, the village cooperative has convened a meeting of member representatives, strictly criticized Han Xiba, dismissed him from his post, and recovered the embezzled public funds.

### 山西霍县合作社  对西张村合作社韩希把贪污的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　山西霍县合作社
    对西张村合作社韩希把贪污的检讨编辑同志：
    人民日报二月二十七日《读者来信》栏所刊登的亚男同志对山西霍县西张村合作社采购员韩希把贪污渎职的批评一文是完全正确的。韩希把自担任该合作社采购员后，即表现生活散漫、腐化，缺乏为社员服务的思想。此事的发生，我们县合作社也要负一部分责任。如该村合作社派韩希把至石家庄买弹花车是为了经营图利，我们知道了，却未加制止。该社未请示上级，就到石家庄办货，我们也未指示处理，这说明我们没有尽到应有的责任。从这件事中，也检查出我们县社与村社间业务上的联系不够，未重视对合作社干部的教育。为此，该村合作社已召开了社员代表会议，对韩希把进行了严格的批评，并罢免了他的职务，追还了他所挪用的公款。
