        Shijiazhuang Railway Hospital is Irresponsible
        The treatment of Zhang Migui should be investigated

To the Editor:

    We believe that the work attitude of some doctors at the Shijiazhuang Railway Hospital should be improved. Zhang Migui, a worker of our section, sprained his left foot on December 5th of last year due to carelessness at work. He went to the Shijiazhuang Railway Hospital outpatient clinic every day. Initially, he could walk a short distance with crutches. After more than twenty days of treatment, not only did it not improve, but he even had difficulty walking. Later, he was hospitalized for treatment. When he was first hospitalized, his bowel movements were normal, and with assistance, he could walk five or six steps in the room. After nearly a month in the hospital, Zhang Migui's lower body could not move; he only had a bowel movement once every four or five days after an enema. The doctor could not cure him and said he had venereal disease. After four blood tests at the hospital, it was proven that he did not have venereal disease. At that time, the union cadres felt that the hospital could not treat him and requested a transfer to another hospital. The hospital still believed they could cure him and did not agree to the transfer. By the beginning of March, Zhang Migui was unable to move his entire body. It is said that the doctor damaged his spinal cord when drawing spinal fluid. At this time, the union firmly requested a transfer to another hospital. The director of the hospital's medical department still disagreed, believing that given Zhang Migui's current condition, it would be difficult to cure him even if he were transferred to another hospital. Every time we visited Zhang Migui, he would cry to us about the irresponsible behavior of the doctors and nurses towards patients. Sometimes, they would cut the electric bell wire because they were annoyed that patients called for help at night.

    We hope that the Shijiazhuang Railway Hospital will review the treatment of Zhang Migui and change this irresponsible medical style.

    石家庄铁路医院不负责
    应检查给张米贵治病的经过编辑同志：
    我们认为石家庄铁路医院某些医生的工作态度，是应当改进的。本段工人张米贵在去年十二月五日，因工作不慎，将左足扭伤。他每天到石家庄铁路医院门诊。开始，他每天还可以扶着拐棍走上里把路。经过二十多天的诊治，不但没有见效，反而连行走都困难了。后来，他又住院医治。初住院时大小便正常，用人扶着，还能在屋内走五六步。住院将近一月，张米贵下半身不能转动；每四、五天灌肠后才大便一次。医生没有办法治，就说他有花柳病。经过该院四次抽血检验，证明没有花柳病。当时工会干部觉得该院无法治疗，请求办理转院手续。该院仍认为他们可以治好，不同意转院。至三月初，张米贵已全身不能活动。据说是医生给他抽脊髓抽坏的。这时，工会又坚决要求转院。该院医务主任还是不同意，他认为像张米贵现在的病，转到别的医院也难以治好。我们每次去看张米贵时，他都向我们哭诉医生、看护对病人不负责任的情形，有时他们嫌病人夜里叫人麻烦，就把电铃线掐断。
    我们希望石家庄铁路医院对张米贵的治疗经过应进行检讨，改变这种对病人不负责任的医疗作风。
