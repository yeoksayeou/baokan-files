(Xinhua News Agency, April 29th) The Executive Committee of the International Union of Students (IUS), holding its meeting in Beijing, continued its sessions on the 27th and 28th. The meeting discussed the report by the IUS President, Grohman, on "Student Movements in Colonies and Dependent Countries and the Tasks of the IUS." A committee composed of nine people, including Grohman, Soviet representative Yershova, and Chinese representative Yang Cheng, was formed to draft a resolution on this agenda item.

    Democratic student representatives from various countries who spoke at the meeting expressed their agreement with Grohman's report. They unanimously praised the great achievements of the Chinese people and expressed their support for the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and further strengthened unity to defend world peace. The speeches by the student representatives from Japan, Thailand, and the Philippines, who were attending the IUS meeting for the first time, were especially warmly welcomed.

    The speech by Korean representative Park Chol-bok was warmly welcomed by all the representatives. Park Chol-bok reported on the active participation of Korean students in the struggle against the American aggressors. He said: With the support of peace-loving people around the world, the Korean people have become stronger in the struggle. The heroic struggle of the Korean people proves that only by resolutely opposing imperialist colonizers can national independence and the right to education be achieved.

    Vietnamese student representative Nguyen Cang said: All Vietnamese students are fighting alongside the Vietnamese people against French and American imperialism, which is turning Vietnam into a base for aggression against China and Southeast Asian countries. He urged students from Asian countries to unite closely in the struggle against colonialism and imperialism.

    Japanese student representative Toyama Kon said: Encouraged by the booming Japanese labor movement after World War II, Japanese students launched a movement against the enslavement and colonial education of American imperialism. Recently, the Japanese student movement has united approximately 400,000 university students and approximately 1.6 million newly established Japanese high school students. The Japanese student movement is closely integrated with the Japanese people's struggle against re-militarization and for a comprehensive peace treaty, and it is closely integrated with the Asian and world people's struggle to defend peace.

    Thai representative Saisunthorn spoke, denouncing the reactionary Thai Luang Phibuns government for selling the country's rights to American imperialism, which has plunged the vast majority of the Thai people into poverty. She pointed out that the task of the Thai student movement is to strive for the true independence of the motherland, and therefore, the first thing to do is to oppose American imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Luang Phibuns government. Currently, the Thai student movement and the Thai national liberation movement are combined with the struggle to demand the withdrawal of American troops from Korea and oppose American imperialism's arming of Japan.

    Philippine student representative Santos exposed the crimes of American imperialism's aggression against the Philippines. He said that under the influence of the growing armed struggle of the Philippine people against American imperialism, even those Philippine students who have been deeply influenced by "American culture" have now joined the ranks of the Philippine people's struggle.

    Malayan student representative Lin Hong, in his speech, thanked the students of various countries for their encouragement and support to the Malayan students in their arduous struggle. He reported on the heroic armed struggle and legal struggle of the Malayan students, and urged British and American student organizations to launch a movement against the barbaric massacres of imperialism. He declared: Culture cannot be destroyed; it is the imperialists themselves who will be destroyed.

    Student representatives from India, Burma, and Ceylon all expressed their enthusiasm to learn from the glorious Chinese students in their speeches. Indian representative Ray said that only after arriving in China did he truly understand what national liberation and national independence are. Burmese representative Kim Wan Rong said that it increases their confidence that student representatives from colonies and dependent countries can meet in Beijing to discuss issues related to them. Ceylon representative Stanley said that American imperialism's so-called "aid" is a means of aggression. He said that colonial students must learn from the Chinese students' struggle experience.

    Soviet representative Yershova used the brilliant achievements of the various ethnic groups of the Soviet Union and the new China in culture and education to illustrate that only after achieving national independence and establishing their own people's country can students' lives be improved and elevated. She said that in the just struggle of students in colonies and dependent countries, Soviet students will always stand with them.

    German Democratic Republic representative Terba, Czechoslovak representative Kratochvíl, Romanian representative Baileanu, Hungarian representative Gozdon-Yi, Bulgarian representative Georgieva, and Mongolian representative Sherav all used specific facts to illustrate the rapid development of their respective countries' education, and the improvement of students' living and learning conditions. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the struggle of students in colonies and dependent countries for national independence and democratic education.

    Dutch representative Onroegas, on behalf of Dutch students, expressed support for students in colonies and dependent countries, and emphasized his willingness to unite and cooperate with Indonesian students. French representative Chavano said that French students support colonial students in their struggle for national independence and are willing to cooperate with Vietnamese students. Belgian representative De Cock said that students from all countries should help colonial students living in distress. British representative Gruse said that national independence is an indispensable prerequisite for democratic education.

    The discussion of the first agenda item ended on the 28th. At the afternoon meeting, Gu Qizong, Chairman of the Beijing Students' Federation, paid tribute to the Executive Committee on behalf of the students of Beijing and invited the representatives attending this Executive Committee meeting to participate in the Beijing May Fourth Youth Day celebration rally, which was warmly welcomed.
