　　Beijing Da Guangming Cinema Accepts Public Criticism
    Reactionary Music Records Inspected and Destroyed
To the Editor:
    After seeing the reader Qian Xuezhao's criticism in the reader's letter column of your newspaper on March 21st, regarding our cinema playing American reactionary music and Fascist German military music records, all the staff of our cinema held a meeting for self-examination. This was because the staff of our cinema did not understand musical scores, and had relatively few records, so they blindly adopted these reactionary music records. We recognize that this was a serious mistake, and immediately conducted a detailed inspection of all the records in our cinema. All records with reactionary content have been destroyed. All the staff of our cinema guarantee that we will never make this mistake again. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Qian Xuezhao.
        Beijing Da Guangming Cinema

　　北京大光明电影院接受群众批评
    对反动乐曲唱片已检查销毁编辑同志：
    见到贵报三月二十一日读者来信专页，发表读者钱学昭对我院放送美国反动音乐和法西斯德国军乐唱片的批评，我们全院职工即集会检讨。这是因我院职工都不了解曲谱，唱片又较少，就盲目采用了这些反动乐曲唱片。我们认识到这是一个严重的错误，并立即对本院所有唱片进行了详细的检查，所有反动内容的唱片已销毁。我们全院职工保证今后决不再犯这种错误。谨向钱学昭君表示谢意。
        北京市大光明电影院
