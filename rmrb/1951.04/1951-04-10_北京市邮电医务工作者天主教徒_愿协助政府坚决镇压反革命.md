　　Beijing Postal and Medical Workers Who are Catholics
　  Willing to Assist the Government in Resolutely Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries
    The preparatory committee of the Beijing Catholic Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression convened a symposium of Catholic postal and medical workers in the city on April 1st. Xue Chengye, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Culture and Education of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, attended and gave guidance. Liu Fudong, chairman of the symposium, said in his speech: The central issue of the patriotic movement of Catholics is to actively carry out the self-government, self-support, and self-propagation reform movement. For more than a hundred years, imperialism has used Catholicism to invade and oppress the Chinese people. We can only resolutely and thoroughly cut off all ties with imperialism, purge the imperialist elements hidden in the church, and eliminate the influence of imperialism on the church, so that Catholics can truly stand up and realize the patriotic aspirations of Catholics. Then the participating Catholics spoke enthusiastically, expressing their willingness to assist the People's Government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, eliminate destructive elements in the church, and wash away the stains of Catholicism. Postal workers Wang Jingru, Zhang Zhongli, Hao Cunhou, Wang Xiyu and others particularly pointed out that the patriotic movement of Catholics should not remain on paper, but should be expressed in practical actions. Since the American invasion of the Korean War began last year, Catholics working in the post office have actively participated in the patriotic production competition, and some have even been named model workers because of their special efforts.

　　北京市邮电医务工作者天主教徒
　  愿协助政府坚决镇压反革命
    北京市天主教保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会筹备会于四月一日召开全市邮电和医务工作者天主教徒座谈会。北京市人民政府文教局副局长薛成业出席指导。座谈会主席刘福栋致词说：天主教徒爱国运动的中心问题是积极开展自治、自养、自传革新运动。一百多年来帝国主义利用天主教侵略压迫中国人民，我们只有坚决彻底地斩断与帝国主义的一切联系，把潜藏在教会中的帝国主义分子清洗出去，并肃清帝国主义对教会的影响，天主教徒才能真正站立起来，才能实现天主教徒的爱国愿望。接着与会教徒热烈发言，愿意协助人民政府镇压反革命，将教会中的破坏分子清除出去，洗刷天主教的污点。邮电工人王景儒、张忠礼、郝存厚、王希禹等更特别指出，天主教徒的爱国运动不应停留在口头上，而要以实际行动表现出来。自去年美国侵略朝鲜战争开始后，在邮局工作的天主教徒已积极地参加了爱国主义的生产竞赛，因为工作特别努力，有的并已被评为劳动模范。
