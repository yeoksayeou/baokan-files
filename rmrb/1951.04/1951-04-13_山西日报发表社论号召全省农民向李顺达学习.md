Shanxi Daily Publishes Editorial
    Calling on Farmers Throughout the Province to Learn from Li Shunda

　　On April 5th, the Shanxi Daily published an editorial entitled "Li Shunda is a Model Laborer and a Patriotic Model," calling on labor models and farmers throughout the province to greet this year's "May Day" with practical actions of learning from Li Shunda and responding to the challenge of the Li Shunda mutual aid team. The editorial pointed out: The outstanding achievements of Li Shunda and the mutual aid team he leads in production lie in the fact that he has set an example for farmers. This example answers a major question in the minds of all farmers: After the implementation of land reform, what path should farmers take if they want to live a richer life? For eight years, the Li Shunda mutual aid team has used living facts to fully prove what Chairman Mao said long ago: "Organizing is the only way to transform from poverty to wealth." Especially in the recent two or three years, the Li Shunda mutual aid team has again used living facts to fully prove that the call made by the Communist Party and the People's Government—combining mutual aid teams with improving technology, developing rural sideline occupations, and supply and marketing cooperatives—is the correct direction for developing rural productive forces and prospering the rural economy. The Li Shunda mutual aid team has consistently persisted, never slackened, whether in the past war years, or during the land reform period and after land reform. Moreover, they have been developing and improving the work of the mutual aid team every year. They use new-style agricultural tools for cultivation, adopt scientific methods to select seeds and prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests, and use surplus labor to develop sideline occupations. It is one of the earliest and best-performing mutual aid teams in the province. Every member of the Li Shunda mutual aid team is also a member of the cooperative. The Li Shunda mutual aid team used these new and advanced production methods to turn a poor gully in Ping顺 County into a rich gully. The yield per mu in the whole village exceeded the pre-war production level by 77.5 percent, and his mutual aid team exceeded it by 95 percent. This year, they are fully confident of exceeding the pre-war level by 108.4 percent. The income from their various sideline productions has also greatly exceeded the pre-war level. Moreover, their mutual aid team already has public accumulation funds and public property as funds for expanding the collective production undertakings of the mutual aid team and for mutual emergency assistance. It can be seen that Li Shunda is a clever and capable innovator in labor production and a model leader in organization.
    The editorial stated: Li Shunda's achievements in production are mainly due to his hard work in studying politics, constantly paying attention to major domestic and international events, and raising his patriotic consciousness, which he achieved by combining production and politics. Now, in our province's factories or rural areas, there are often people who think that as long as they bury themselves in production and don't care about national affairs, they can still be a labor model. Some staff members even think that as long as they concentrate on their own business and technology, it is enough, and studying politics seems to be superfluous or dispensable. However, Li Shunda's experience over the past ten years has proved that only by working hard to study the politics of New Democracy can one broaden one's horizons, know what path to take in production, and why take this path? Only when the masses' political awareness is raised can the masses' wisdom, the masses' enthusiasm for production, and creativity be truly brought into play. Therefore, every member of the mutual aid team led by Li Shunda not only has a very high enthusiasm for production, but also has a very high patriotic spirit.
    The editorial continued: As everyone knows, Li Shunda is a poor peasant who suffered cruel exploitation in the old society. For more than ten years, he has been determined that only by following the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can there be a bright future. As early as the Anti-Japanese War, he was already a model Communist Party member. Under the education of the Party, he always harbored great hatred and resolute determination to fight against feudalism, imperialism, and their running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Whether during the war, during the land reform period, or now in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, he always walked in front of the masses, leading the masses in various struggles. He has always actively responded to, carefully studied, and implemented every call of the Party and the People's Government. He subscribes to the Shanxi Daily, Farmer's Daily, and Shanxi Pictorial, and regularly studies politics and current affairs, and conducts propaganda to the masses.
    Because he actively studies politics, his vision has broadened and he can see further, so he is very fond of science and technology. When he first visited the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition, he took the lead in advocating the use of new-style agricultural tools. He actively promoted the role of cities helping the countryside and workers leading the peasants. He is very fond of and concerned about all public property and collective interests in the mutual aid team. Because he clearly realizes that the long-term development of all collective undertakings will bring unlimited happiness to every farmer.
    His patriotism is also reflected in his firm belief in the collective strength of the masses. At no time has he been proud because he has achieved success or received praise. He has received first-class awards at the two labor hero conferences in the Taihang area in the past. He also won the honorary title of the first agricultural labor model at the provincial labor model conference last year. He attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers and received a certificate with Chairman Mao's inscription "Model on the Production Front." The reason why he has been able to maintain the glorious title of labor model for several years is because he has continuously strived to improve his political consciousness and humbly learn from the masses. The mutual aid team he led has been able to persist for eight years due to the unity among the members and the development of the spirit of collectivism of mutual learning. This March, their patriotic production competition initiated to mutual aid teams and farmers across the country was proposed on the basis of in-depth patriotic study of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. In their challenge letter, they listed studying politics and improving political consciousness as the first guarantee for completing the competition conditions. At the same time, in order to ensure regular patriotic propaganda, they recently designated three members in the mutual aid team to serve as propagandists, fully demonstrating their love for the great motherland.
    The editorial finally called on more than 13,000 industrial and agricultural labor models in the province to learn from Li Shunda, work hard to study politics, and become production models and patriotic models. It also called on Party and government leading organs at all levels and all cadres to give play to the leading role, backbone role, and bridge role of labor models, and to regularly help all labor models strengthen their political study and improve their patriotic awareness.

### 山西日报发表社论号召全省农民向李顺达学习

　　山西日报发表社论
    号召全省农民向李顺达学习
    山西日报四月五日以《李顺达是劳动模范又是爱国模范》为题，发表社论，号召全省劳动模范和农民要以向李顺达学习和向李顺达互助组应战的实际行动，迎接今年的“五一”节。社论指出：李顺达和他所领导的互助组，在生产事业上的突出成就，就在于他给农民们树立了一个榜样。这个榜样，回答了所有农民心里的一个大问题，这就是在实行了土地改革之后，农民要想过更加富裕的生活，究竟要走那条道路？八年来，李顺达互助组用活的事实，完全证明了毛主席早就说过的：“组织起来是由穷变富的必由之路”。尤其是最近二、三年来，李顺达互助组又用活的事实，完全证明了共产党和人民政府所提出的号召——把互助组与提高技术、发展农村副业和供销合作社三者结合起来，是发展农村生产力、繁荣农村经济的正确方向。李顺达互助组，无论在过去战争时期，或在土地改革时期及土地改革以后，一贯地坚持下来，从来没有松懈过。而且每年都在发展与改进着互助组的工作。他们采用新式农具来耕作，采用科学的方法来选种、防除病虫害，并利用剩余劳力来发展副业，是全省最早而且是成绩最好的一个互助组。李顺达互助组，每个组员又是合作社社员。李顺达互助组，就是用了这些新型的先进的生产方式，把平顺县的一个穷沟变成了富沟，全村每亩地产量超过战前生产水平百分之七十七点五，他的互助组超过了百分之九十五，今年他们完全有信心超过战前百分之一百零八点四，他们的各种副业生产的收入也大大超过了战前。而且他们互助组里，已经有了公积金和公共财产，作为扩大互助组的集体生产事业和相互救急的费用。由此可见，李顺达是劳动生产上一位聪明能干的革新者，也是组织起来的一个模范的领导者。
    社论称：李顺达在生产事业上的成就，主要是他努力学习政治，时时关心国内国外的大事，提高自己爱国主义的觉悟，把生产与政治结合起来而取得的。现在，我们省内工厂里或农村里，常常有这样的人，他们认为只要埋头生产，不必管那些国家大事，一样可以当个劳动模范。甚至还有些工作人员，他们认为，只要专心于自己的业务和技术就够了，学习政治似乎是多余的，或者是可有可无的。但是，李顺达十多年来的经验证明，只有努力学习新民主主义的政治，才能使自己的眼界开阔起来，才知道在生产事业上要走什么道路，并且为什么要走这条道路？只有群众的政治觉悟提高了，群众的聪明智慧，群众生产的积极性和创造性才能真正发挥起来。所以李顺达所领导的互助组的每个组员，不仅生产情绪非常高涨，而且爱国主义的情绪也同样是非常高涨的。
    社论继称：大家都知道，李顺达是一个受过旧社会残酷剥削的贫农，十多年以来，他就下定决心只有跟着共产党和毛主席走，才有光明前途。早在抗日战争时期，他就已经是一个模范的共产党员了。在党的教育下，他对封建主义、帝国主义及其走狗蒋匪帮，始终怀着极大的仇恨和坚决斗争的决心。无论在战争时期、土地改革时期和现在镇压反革命时，他都是走着群众前头，带领群众，进行各种斗争。他对党和人民政府的每个号召，从来是积极响应，细心学习，贯彻执行的。他订有山西日报、农民报、山西画报，经常学习政治、时事，并向群众进行宣传。
    由于他积极学习政治，他的眼光放宽了，看远了，因此他对科学技术是很热爱的。当他第一次参观了天津工业展览会之后，他首先以身作则提倡使用新式农具。他积极宣传城市帮助乡村、工人领导农民的作用。对互助组中的一切公共财产和集体利益，他是非常爱护和关心的。因为他清楚地认识到，一切集体事业发展的远景，将给每个农民带来无限的幸福。
    他的爱国主义的觉悟还表现在他十分相信群众的集体力量。任何时候，他没有因为有了成绩、得到了表扬而骄傲。他在过去太行区两次劳动英雄会上，都曾得到过头等奖励。去年全省劳动模范会上又得到了第一名农业劳动模范的光荣称号。并出席了全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议，获得了毛主席亲笔题辞“生产战线上的模范”的奖状。他几年来能始终保持住劳动模范的光荣称号，是因为他不断努力提高自己的政治觉悟和虚心向群众学习的结果。他领导的互助组，由于组员之间的团结和发扬了互相学习的集体主义的精神，因此能坚持八年之久。今年三月，他们向全国互助组和农民发起的爱国丰产的竞赛，是在深入抗美援朝的爱国主义学习的基础上提出的。他们在挑战书中，把学习政治、提高政治觉悟列为完成竞赛条件的第一项保证。同时，他们最近为了保证经常进行爱国主义的宣传，并在互助组内指定三个组员担任宣传员的工作，充分表现了他们对伟大祖国的热爱。
    社论最后号召全省一万三千多工农业的劳动模范，向李顺达看齐，努力学习政治，成为生产模范和爱国模范。并号召各级党政领导机关和所有干部发挥劳动模范的带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用，经常地帮助所有劳动模范加强政治学习，提高爱国主义的觉悟。
