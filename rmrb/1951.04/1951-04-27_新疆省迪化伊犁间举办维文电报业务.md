　　Uyghur Telegraph Service Launched Between Dihua and Yili, Xinjiang Province

    Xinhua News Agency: After more than a year of research, the Xinjiang Provincial Telecommunications Bureau has created a method for sending telegrams in Uyghur. Starting from April 1st, the bureau has launched Uyghur telegraph services between Dihua and Yili, and aims to extend it to ten larger bureaus and offices in Northern and Southern Xinjiang within this year. Uyghur people account for more than 80 percent of the total population of Xinjiang Province. Although Xinjiang Province had telegrams 50 years ago, the Uyghur people have never been able to use their own writing to transmit telegrams. The success of Uyghur telegraphy will greatly strengthen communication and cultural exchange among the Uyghur people.

　　新疆省迪化伊犁间举办维文电报业务
    新疆省电信管理局经过一年多的研究，创造了用维吾尔文通电报的方法。该局已于四月一日起，首先在迪化与伊犁间举办维文电报业务，并争取在今年内推广到南北疆十个较大的局、所。按新疆省维吾尔民族人民占全省人口的百分之八十以上。虽然五十年前新疆省就已有了电报，但维族人民一直不能使用自己的文字传递电报。现在维文通报的成功，将大大加强维吾尔民族中的通信联系和文化交流。
