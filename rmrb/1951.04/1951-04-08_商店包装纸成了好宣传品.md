　　Store Wrapping Paper Becomes a Good Propaganda Tool
    The Xie Da Xiang Silk and Cloth Store in Shanghai has recently printed various slogans promoting Resist America, Aid Korea, and oppose the American armament of Japan on its wrapping paper, which is very popular among the masses. The store uses thousands of wrapping papers every day, thus providing current affairs education to a portion of the urban population. In Longyao County, Hebei Province, public and private stores print various cartoons, quick verse, drum lyrics, poems, and slogans promoting Resist America, Aid Korea on their wrapping paper. For example, the wrapping paper of bookstores writes "Studying and literacy broaden knowledge, Resist America, Aid Korea, and protect the homeland," and candles are printed with golden characters "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Country," making the wrapping paper a propaganda tool that is widely circulated among the masses.

　　商店包装纸成了好宣传品
    上海市协大祥绸布号最近在包装纸上印上抗美援朝和反对美国武装日本的各种标语，进行宣传，很受群众欢迎。该店每日使用包装纸达数千份，这样，使一部分市民群众受到了时事教育。河北省隆尧县各公私商店在包装纸上印上各种抗美援朝的漫画，快板，鼓词，诗歌，标语口号等。如书店的包装纸上写着“念书识字知识广，抗美援朝保家乡”，蜡烛上印着“抗美援朝，保家卫国”等金字，使包装纸变成了宣传品，广泛流行于群众中。
