To the Editor:

	As long as our people's eyes are bright, there will be nowhere for counter-revolutionaries to hide. The incident of the woman Li Shuying catching a spy while visiting relatives is a very good illustration. Li Shuying currently lives in Mentougou, District 16 of suburban Beijing. Her husband, Zhou Zhen, had previously been persecuted by special agents. On April 1st, Li Shuying went to Zhaojiatai Village to visit her sister. After dinner, her sister took her to visit the Sun family next door. They chatted with Old Mrs. Sun. Old Mrs. Sun talked about her three daughters, and as she talked, she mentioned that one of her daughters was married to He Liangui from Guishi Village.

	As soon as Li Shuying heard the name He Liangui, she was shocked. He Liangui was one of the main culprits who created the "Guishi Village Bloodbath" and persecuted her husband. In 1946, Guishi Village was liberated by the then Eighth Route Army and a people's government was established. On the night of August 17th of the same year, Kuomintang special agents He Liangui and He Lianzhi colluded with the Mentougou Kuomintang reactionary armed forces to sneak into Guishi Village, killing village chief Zhou Jun and militia captain Zhou Xin, kidnapping eight or nine village cadres and militiamen, and looting all firearms and weapons. Li Shuying's husband, Zhou Zhen, was arrested and beaten half to death, but luckily he escaped later.

	After liberation, through mass accusations, He Lianzhi had already been arrested and executed by the government, but He Liangui had been hiding and had not been discovered.

	When Li Shuying learned that Old Mrs. Sun was He Liangui's mother-in-law, she pretended to be unaffected and talked to Old Mrs. Sun about her son-in-law He Liangui's family situation. Finally, she found out that He Liangui was currently living in the Sun's home. After leaving the Sun's house, Li Shuying quickly ran to the Yangpoyuan Administrative Village, where Guishi Village was located, and reported to the militia headquarters. That night, the Yangpoyuan Administrative Village sent out militiamen to Zhaojiatai Village and arrested the extremely wicked special agent He Liangui. On April 2nd, Li Shuying, along with the militiamen, tied up the special agent criminal He Liangui and sent him to the Mentougou Public Security Bureau. The local people praised Li Shuying's exemplary behavior in catching a spy.

### 李淑英串亲戚不忘捉特务

    李淑英串亲戚不忘捉特务编辑同志：
    只要咱们人民的眼睛亮起来，反革命分子就无处存身。妇女李淑英串亲戚捉特务这件事，就是一个很好的说明。李淑英现住在京郊十六区门头沟，她丈夫周珍曾受过特务分子的迫害。四月一日，李淑英到赵家台村去看她姐姐。吃过饭，姐姐领她到邻近孙家去串门子。她们和孙老太太闲谈起来。孙老太太谈起她的三个女儿，谈着，谈着，她提起自己有一个女儿，嫁给圭石村的何连贵。
    李淑英一听到何连贵的名子，心里吃了一惊。何连贵就是制造“圭石村血案”迫害她丈夫的主犯之一。一九四六年，圭石村曾被当时的八路军解放，并建立了人民政权。同年八月十七日夜里，国民党特务何连贵、何连芝勾结门头沟国民党反动武装摸进圭石村，杀死村长周俊、民兵队长周信，绑走村干部及民兵八、九人，并抢去所有枪枝武器。李淑英的丈夫周珍被抓去后，打的死去活来，后来幸亏逃脱。
    解放后，经过群众控诉，何连芝已经被政府逮捕枪毙了，但何连贵却一直隐藏起来，未得发现。
    李淑英知道了孙老太太就是何连贵的岳母，她就装作没事人，和孙老太太谈扯她女婿何连贵家的情形，最后终于探听出何连贵现时就住在孙家。李淑英打孙家出来，就赶紧跑到圭石村所在的杨坡园行政村，报告了民兵队部。当夜，即由杨坡园行政村派出民兵，到赵家台村逮捕了罪大恶极的特务何连贵。四月二日，李淑英随同民兵一起，把特务罪犯何连贵五花大绑送到门头沟公安局。当地人民都称赞李淑英抓特务的模范行为。
