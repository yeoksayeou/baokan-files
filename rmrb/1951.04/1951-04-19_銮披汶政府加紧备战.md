　　The Phibun Government Intensifies War Preparations
　　Ou Weiqun
    Travelers entering Thailand today will undoubtedly feel that the Thai government's war preparations and anti-communist clamor, like the tropical weather, are suffocating. Government officials and the pronouncements of kept newspapers and radio stations are desperately clamoring for war, as if the war had already begun on this land. Apart from the differences in language and writing, one might think that this peninsula in the tropics is a state under American rule. All the words and deeds of the ruling class here fully reflect the will of Washington. Huge war preparation costs, rapid expansion of military power, hoarding of materials... all these scenes are a microcosm of today's America.
    Thailand's fiscal budget for 1951 is the largest in Thai history. The total amount of the three major items, namely ordinary expenditure, investment special expenditure and non-investment special expenditure, is 3.5 billion baht (Thai currency, each baht is equivalent to 1.024 RMB, according to the Bank of China's exchange rate on March 10). Even on the surface figures, the Ministry of Defense's expenses rank first, totaling more than 252.2 million baht. In addition to this, there is a "National Defense Fund" of more than 230.4 million baht, military equipment purchase funds of more than 10 million baht, and strategic highway construction reserve funds of more than 145.53 million baht. War preparation-related expenditures also include: geographical survey fees, horse breeding improvement fees, military school subsidy fees, oil storage station construction fees, airport expansion fees, aerial mapping fees, etc., totaling more than 54 million baht. The total direct and indirect war preparation-related expenses amount to approximately 700 million baht.
    The Ministry of Interior's expenditure this year is more than 179.7 million. Most of it is used to expand and strengthen the police force. The police in Thailand are a disguised form of the army.
    At the end of February this year, when the Thai Senate discussed the budget bill, the Phibun government was accused by its American master of being ineffective in war preparation. As a result, he hurriedly ordered the Ministry of Finance to formulate a special budget for the first phase of the war preparation plan. The initial budget totaled at least more than 50 million baht, and they were impatiently demanding to use it in advance before submitting it to the parliament for retroactive approval. It is not difficult to believe that since there are so-called special expenses for the first phase of the war preparation plan, there will undoubtedly be a second phase and a third phase thereafter.
    Under the urging and instigation of the American ambassador to Thailand, the Phibun clique's war preparation measures have been popularized to all levels of administrative departments. On February 14 this year, Phibun drafted an outline of a wartime plan, which is divided into three parts: military, administrative and economic. Although the detailed content has not been disclosed, it is not difficult to understand from the various war preparation measures taken by the Thai government in recent months that this so-called wartime plan is a plan to mobilize Thailand and prepare it to enter the war in the short term. According to the Thai government, the entire wartime work will be completed before the end of this year.
    At the beginning of February this year, the Ministry of Defense, headed by Phibun, decided to expand the number of new recruits this year (according to the recruitment period in April) to twice that of last year. The physical standards for new recruits were lowered so that each battalion would have four full-strength companies. At the same time, the Army Department also "called on" educated youths to join the army, without any numerical limit. These youths will serve as platoon-level officers after completing their training. The active-duty soldiers whose term of service expires in May this year will not be discharged for the time being.
    At the beginning of January this year, the Supreme Committee of the Thai Ministry of Defense originally planned to summon demobilized soldiers to join the army, train them to use American weapons, and investigate the addresses of the first-class reserves in preparation for conscription. However, because the time for military mobilization was not yet ripe, the spokesman of the military authorities concealed the news of the conscription of reserves as a "rumor with ulterior motives."
    Although demobilized soldiers of the army have not been conscripted into the army, the air force authorities ordered demobilized air force personnel above the rank of sergeant to report for duty at the end of January. The personnel that the military department paid special attention to were machine gunners on fighter planes and bombers and transport plane personnel. It is reported that 200 air force personnel have reported on time. At the end of February, Phibun also ordered the rush repair and expansion of four airports so that giant military aircraft could take off and land. Two of the four airports are in Phetchaburi Province and Prachuap Khiri Khan Province (there is also a seaplane base here) in the south-central part of Thailand bordering Myanmar, one is in Tak Province on the Thai-Myanmar border south of Chiang Mai in the north, and the other is in Maha Sarakham Province in the northeast.
    This year's naval conscription quota has also been decided to be increased by 20% compared with last year, while expanding the organization of the Naval Department. In addition to receiving more than 30 warships "assisted" by the United States, there is an urgent need to purchase one transport ship each of about 3,000 tons and 1,000 tons, and one oil tanker of more than 1,000 tons.
    In order to supplement the inadequacy of the regular army and police force, the Ministry of Interior, under the order of the US State Department at the end of January this year, organized a national so-called "People's Self-Defense Force." The first phase plans to organize 50,000 people, with the Minister of Interior as the commander-in-chief, the county heads of each county as the local responsible persons, and the village chiefs, reactionary teachers in schools, and retired soldiers as the backbone. The so-called "People's Self-Defense Force" is actually a disguised police and secret service organization.
    The construction of strategic highways is also in progress. The system centered on Chiang Mai (an important stronghold in northern Thailand) has been decided to allocate more than 7 million baht for construction and limit its completion by the middle of the year. The construction cost of the highway system centered on Ubon Ratchathani (a key area in the northeast) is being reviewed.
    In terms of materials, the Phibun government has partially begun to carry out controls and hoarding. Materials such as medicines, paper, gauze, and copper and iron have been gradually brought under control. At the end of February, the Thai government held a so-called wartime national grain conference, discussing the following: 1. How to control all food in the country and implement government storage; 2. The distribution of food in wartime; 3. How to collect grain in wartime. The Minister of Commerce openly declared that rationing would be adopted when necessary for people's daily necessities.
    In order to facilitate the looting and plunder of US imperialism, the Ministry of Commerce has specially set up an "Export Office to the United States" and decided to hoard tin ore and rubber and directly export them to the United States instead of merchants.
    The Phibun reactionary clique's war preparation clamor is isolated. The Thai people only feel the rising prices and more and more Americans, but cannot see the so-called "communist aggression." In order to facilitate deceiving the Thai people, Phibun held a national county head training class in mid-January, so that this group of local administrative heads could learn a set of words and phrases to anesthetize the people, strengthen the methods of controlling the people, and divide the relationship between the Thai people and foreigners. After completing their training and returning to their respective places, they gave speeches to the Thai people, clamoring that "World War is about to break out" and "The Communist Party is about to attack Thailand," attempting to deceive and hoodwink the Thai people in order to further exploit them.
    The Thai government's wartime evacuation plan is being prepared. It is said that the plan to evacuate Bangkok residents has been secretly drafted and will be enforced at that time. The military authorities also nervously said that Bangkok might be declared a undefended city.
    The air defense conference has also been held, and the air defense organization has been expanded. The air-raid shelters built by the Japanese occupation forces will be rebuilt.
    The Thai government frantically clamors that "the Korean War is the fuse of the Third World War," "the Communist Party is going to invade Thailand," and "Thailand is going to fight for the United Nations," but it is also deeply afraid that the people will not believe it, so on the one hand, it constantly publicizes the importance of so-called "American aid," and on the other hand, it blames the Communist Party for the responsibility of military and police conflicts, factional struggles and rising prices.
    Under Phibun's frantic war preparation and reactionary rule, the Thai people are increasingly feeling the increasing poverty of life and the threat of war. They are increasingly dissatisfied with the Phibun clique's reactionary policy of selling themselves to US imperialism. They demand peace and friendly coexistence with the people of Asian countries. The Thai people's forces against war and striving for peace are gradually growing. Under the fascist suppression of the Phibun government's army and police, the Thai people's peace signatures have reached 100,000. Representatives of the Thai people also attended the first session of the World Peace Council. These facts are clear evidence of the increasing awakening of the Thai people and the growth of their strength. (Attached picture)

　　銮披汶政府加紧备战
　　欧为群
    踏进泰国国境的旅客，现在一定会感觉到，泰国政府的备战措施与反共叫嚣，正如热带的天气一样，使人喘不过气来。政府官员与御用报纸、广播的言论，都声嘶力竭地在叫嚣战争，好像战争早已在这块土地上进行了。除了语言与文字的不同外，人们会以为这个位于热带的半岛，是美国统治下的一个州。这里统治阶级的一切言行，都是充分地仰承着华盛顿的意志。备战费用的庞大、军力的急速扩充。物资的囤积…………这一切景象都是今日美国的缩影。
    一九五一年度泰国的财政预算，是泰国历史上最大的预算。普通支出、投资特别支出与非投资特别支出三大项的总额为三十五亿铢（泰币名，每铢折合人民币一○二四元，根据中国银行三月十日牌价）。就在表面的数字上，国防部费用也占第一位，共二亿五千二百余万铢。除此以外，还有“卫国基金”二亿三千四十余万铢，购买军备费一千余万铢，建筑战略公路准备金一亿四千五百三十余万铢。与备战有关的支出尚有：地舆调查费、马种改良费、军校补助费、储油站建筑费、机场扩充费、空中摄绘地图费等共五千四百余万铢。以上直接间接与备战有关的费用共约为七亿铢。
    内务部本年的支出为一亿七千九百余万。其大部分是用来扩大与加强警察力量的。警察在泰国是一种变相陆军。
    今年二月底，当泰国上院讨论预算案时，銮披汶政府受到美国主子的指责，斥其备战不力。于是他就急忙令财政部制订第一期备战计划特别预算。初步预算总额最少在五千万铢以上，而且还迫不及待地要预先支用然后再交议会追认。不难相信，既然有所谓第一期备战计划的特别费用，那么此后会有第二期，第三期，也就是无疑的了。
    在美国驻泰大使的督促与指使之下，銮披汶集团的备战措施，已经普及到各级行政部门中。今年二月十四日，銮披汶拟定了一个战时计划大纲，这个大纲计分军事、行政与经济三个部分。详细内容虽未披露，但从泰国政府最近几个月来的各种备战措施中，不难明了这个所谓战时计划就是把泰国总动员起来并准备在短期内投入战争的计划。据泰国政府透露：整个战时的工作将在本年年底以前准备完毕。
    今年二月初，由銮披汶兼任部长的国防部，决定将今年度入伍（按入伍期为四月）的新兵额，扩大为去年的两倍，新兵的体格标准则加以降低，以便使每一个营都有兵员足额的四个连。同时陆军署还“号召”知识青年从军，数额无限制。这些青年将于受训期满后，担任排级军官；对于本年五月服役期满的现役军人，则准备暂不遣散。
    本年一月初，泰国国防部最高委员会原拟召集复员士兵入伍，训练他们使用美国武器，并要调查第一类后备军的住址，准备征召入伍。但因军事总动员的时机尚未成熟，因而军事当局的发言人就把征召后备军的消息掩饰成为“别有用心的谣言”了。
    陆军的复员士兵虽未征召入伍，空军当局却于一月底命令士级以上的复员空军入伍报到了，特别引起军部注意的，是战斗机与轰炸机上的机枪手与运输机人员。据悉，按时报到的空军人员已有二百名。銮披汶并于二月底下令赶修与扩大四个飞机场，使能升降巨型的军用飞机。四个机场中的两个，在泰国中部偏南与缅甸交界的佛丕府及巴蜀府（此地尚有水上机场），一个在北部清迈以南泰缅边境上的哒府，另一个在东北部吗哈沙拉堪府。
    本年度海军的征兵额，也决定比去年增加百分之二十，同时扩大海军署的组织。除接收美国“援助”的三十余艘舰艇外，并急需购买三千吨及一千吨左右的运输舰各一艘，一千余吨的载油船一艘。
    为了补正规军与警察力量的不足，内务部于今年一月底奉美国国务院命令组织全国性的所谓“民众自卫军”，第一期打算组织五万人，以内务部长为总司令，以各县县长为地方负责人，以村长、学校中的反动教师及退伍军人等为骨干。所谓“民众自卫军”的组织，实际上就是变相的警察与特务机构。
    战略公路的建筑也在积极进行中。以清迈（泰国北部的重要据点）为中心的系统，已决定拨款七百余万铢进行修建，并限定年中完成。以乌汶（东北部要地）为中心的公路系统，其建筑费正在审核中。
    在物资方面，銮披汶政府已部分地开始进行管制与囤积。药品、纸张、纱布及铜铁等物资均被逐步加以管制。二月底，泰国政府举行了所谓战时国家粮食会议，讨论内容如下：一、如何控制全国所有之粮食以及由政府实行储藏；二、战时粮食的分配；三、战时如何征粮。商业部长曾公开宣称，对于人民生活的必需品，必要时将采取配给制。
    为了便利美帝国主义的搜刮掠夺，商业部特设“对美输出处”，并决定囤储锡砂与树胶，代替商人直接输往美国。
    銮披汶反动集团的备战叫嚣是孤立的，泰国人民只感觉到物价高涨，美国人愈来愈多，而看不到所谓共产党的“侵略”。为了便于欺骗泰国人民，銮披汶于一月中举办了一个全国县长的训练班，让这批地方行政负责人学会一套麻醉人民的词令、加强对人民管制的办法与分化泰国人民与外侨关系的手腕。他们受训完毕回到各地后，就对泰国人民训话，叫嚣什么“世界大战就要爆发了”、“共产党就要进攻泰国了”，企图蒙蔽、欺哄泰国人民，以便进一步利用他们。
    泰国政府的战时疏散计划已在准备中，据说疏散曼谷居民的计划已经秘密拟好，届时要强制执行。军事当局并且还紧张地说，可能宣布曼谷为不设防城市。
    防空会议也已举行过了，防空机构已经扩大。以前由日本占领军所建的防空壕都将重新修建起来。
    泰国政府疯狂地叫嚣“朝鲜战争是第三次世界大战的导火线”、“共产党要侵略泰国”、“泰国要为联合国而战”，但又深怕人民不信，因此一方面又不断地宣扬所谓“美援”的重要性，而一方面把军警冲突、派系斗争与物价高涨的责任推在共产党的身上。
    在銮披汶的疯狂备战与反动统治之下，泰国人民正日益感受到生活的更加贫困与战争的威胁。他们对于銮披汶集团卖身投靠于美帝国主义的反动政策，一天一天地表示不满。他们要求和平并与亚洲各国人民友好共处。泰国人民反对战争、争取和平的力量正在逐渐成长起来。在銮披汶政府军警的法西斯镇压之下，泰国人民的和平签名已达十万。在第一届世界和平理事会上也有泰国人民的代表出席。这些事实，就是泰国人民日益觉醒与他们力量成长的明证。（附图片）
