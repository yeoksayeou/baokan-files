　　A Record of the Cotton Farmer Representative Meeting in Anyang Special District, Pingyuan Province
　　Jiang Fan
　　Anyang, Ye County, and Tangyin County in Anyang Special District, Pingyuan Province, are the main cotton-producing areas, and Qi County and Jun County also have soil suitable for cotton planting. Last year, with the strong call and assistance of the government, the area of cotton fields in the entire region expanded by hundreds of thousands of mu compared to 1949, and the yield of ginned cotton per mu also increased by about four jin. This year, the special district commissioner's office, together with the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, convened a cotton farmer representative meeting, which solved some problems in cotton production and sales, and greatly promoted the expansion of cotton planting this year.

　　Conducting ideological mobilization among cotton farmers, explaining that growing more cotton is beneficial to themselves and the country, is an important key to expanding cotton fields. Although the vast majority of cotton farmers have demands to expand cotton fields, due to the devastation of the enemy puppets and disasters before liberation, many cotton farmers still have the conservative idea of ​​"growing enough grain for use, and planting cotton in the remaining land." In this meeting, the cotton farmers were inspired to recognize the difference between today's People's Government and the past reactionary governments from the facts they experienced, so that the cotton farmers understood that today's cotton planting can not only supply industrial raw materials, but also make profits; the government's policy of encouraging cotton planting was explained, eliminating the cotton farmers' concerns about planting more cotton and increasing the burden. The representatives had confidence in planting cotton and made plans to increase production. Wu Jingu, from Wujiagang Village, Anyang, who has a total of only twenty-four mu of land, plans to plant twenty-two mu of cotton, and decided to apply more topdressing fertilizer and hoe two more times in order to strive for a bumper harvest. In addition, he also proposed to guarantee the mobilization of all the villagers to plant more cotton.

　　Some shortcomings occurred in the work of the state-owned trade department of Pingyuan Province last year, which once caused the unreasonable phenomenon of cheap cotton in spring and expensive cotton in summer. Cotton farmers are unwilling to sell cotton this year. It is estimated that about 45 percent of the cotton that should be sold in the entire region is still in the hands of cotton farmers. Some cotton farmers only sold 20 percent of the cotton stored in 1949 and 1950. At the meeting, specific examples were used to illustrate the benefits of selling cotton and turning "dead cotton into living capital" for cotton farmers. For example, Yang Huiyuan, from Zong Village, Eight District, Anyang, harvested more than 2,000 jin of cotton last year, sold 700 jin, and bought a mule. He earned 800 jin of rice by using the mule to pull stones, and plans to build three buildings this year. At the meeting, it was also explained to everyone that the seasonal price difference that occurred in the past was only an occasional phenomenon. In the future, under the conditions of national financial and economic unification and convenient transportation, the state-owned economy has sufficient strength to ensure timely regulation of materials and grasp reasonable price differences.

　　Administrative cadres attending the meeting introduced the cotton purchase method in detail, explaining the benefits of purchase on credit and storage on behalf of cotton farmers. In this way, cotton farmers began to understand the reason for purchase on credit and storage on behalf, but still held a try-and-see attitude. For example, a representative, Li Mingde, had more than 1,000 jin of cotton stored at home, and only handed over 200 jin to the company for storage on behalf, saying: "The rest will wait and see!" The meeting also focused on the cotton farmers' distrust of the state and fear of exposing their affluence. The thoughts and concerns made the cotton farmers think back to the facts that the exploiting classes in the old society devastated the cotton farmers, and compare them with the facts that today's People's Government and the state-owned economy actively support the cotton farmers and protect the interests of the cotton farmers, so as to enhance the cotton farmers' trust in the People's Government. The relevant departments also reviewed at the meeting the shortcomings existing in the past purchase work, such as unclear grading of cotton collection, inaccurate weighing, complicated procedures, and poor attitudes of cadres; they guaranteed that they would strictly grade in the future, so that cotton farmers would not suffer losses, cotton would be collected as soon as it arrived, the procedures were simple, cotton farmers could withdraw money at any time, and cadres would be educated to improve their work style.

　　After the above discussions and reviews, most of the cotton farmers' thoughts were straightened out. For example, Li Mingde, who originally only decided to store 200 jin of cotton, decided to deposit all 1,000 jin of cotton into the state-owned trade company after discussion. Driven by activists, the purchase on credit and barter were launched on the spot, and the companies announced the types and prices of items for sale on the spot. At this meeting, 22 contracts and 39 agreements were signed, with cotton farmers selling 67,000 jin of seed cotton and 22,000 jin of ginned cotton; cotton farmers exchanged 47 tons of coal, 60,000 jin of salt, 28,000 pieces of bean cake, more than 2,000 jin of fertilizer powder, three sprayers, and a lot of materials such as cloth and department stores. The representatives were extremely enthusiastic, and asked the conference for publicity materials, preparing to carry out publicity to all cotton farmers after returning.

　　记平原省安阳专区棉农代表会
    姜泛
    平原省安阳专区安阳，邺县、汤阴三县，为主要产棉区，淇县、浚县土质亦适合植棉。去年全区在政府大力号召与协助下，较一九四九年扩大棉田数十万亩，同时每亩约增产皮棉四斤。今年该专区专署会同花纱布公司召开了棉农代表会议，解决了棉花产销中的某些问题，对今年扩大植棉，起了很大的推动作用。
    向棉农进行思想动员，说明多种棉花对自己和国家都有利，是扩大棉田的重要关键。广大棉农虽有扩大棉田要求，但由于解放前，屡受敌伪与灾荒的摧残，所以不少棉农还存在着“种粮够用，余地植棉”的保守思想。在这次会议中，启发棉农从本身体会到的事实，认识今天人民政府和过去反动政府的不同，使棉农了解今天种棉花既可以供应工业原料，又可以得利；讲解了政府奖励植棉的政策，消除了棉农怕种棉多增加负担的顾虑。代表们有了种棉的信心，纷纷作出增产计划。安阳吴家岗村吴金贵，总共只有二十四亩地，就计划种二十二亩棉花，并决定要多加追肥，多锄两遍，争取丰收。此外他还提出保证动员全村群众多种棉花。
    去年平原省国营贸易部门工作中曾发生一些缺点，一度造成棉花春贱夏贵的不合理现象。棉农们今年便存棉不愿出售。据估计，现在全专区尚有应售量百分之四十五左右的棉花，存在棉农手里。部分棉农只出售了一九四九年与一九五○年两年存花的百分之二十。会议上用具体例子，说明出售棉花，把“死棉花变成活资本”，对棉农的好处。如安阳八区宗村杨会元，去年收花两千余斤，卖了七百斤，买了骡子一头。他用骡子拉石头赚了八百斤米，今年准备盖三间楼房。会议中，并向大家说明过去发生季节差价，只是偶然现象，今后，在全国财经统一、交通便利的条件下，国营经济有足够力量保证适时调剂物资，掌握合理差价。
    参加会议的行政干部详细地向大家介绍了棉花赊购办法，说明赊购代存对棉农的好处。这样，棉农开始懂得了赊购代存的道理，但还抱着试一试的态度，例如：有一个代表李明德，家里存一千多斤花，只交公司代存二百斤，说：“其余的等看看再说吧！”会议又针对棉农不信任国家、怕暴露自己富足等思想顾虑，让棉农从回想旧社会剥削阶级摧残棉农的事实，来和今天人民政府与国营经济积极扶植棉农，保障棉农利益的事实对比，增强棉农对人民政府的信赖。有关部门并在会议上检讨了过去收购工作中存在着的收花等级不明、秤不准确、手续繁杂，干部态度不好等缺点；保证今后一定严加分级，不使棉农吃亏，棉花随到随收，手续简便，棉农需要用钱随时可取，并教育干部改进作风。
    经过以上讨论和检讨，棉农思想大部搞通，如原来只决定存放二百斤棉花的李明德，经过讨论后，决定将所有一千斤花全部存入国营贸易公司。经过积极分子的带动，当场展开了赊购、换购，各公司当场公布了出售物品的种类和价格。在这个会议上即订立了合同二十二个，协议三十九个，计棉农出售籽棉达六万七千斤，皮棉二万二千斤；棉农换回煤四十七吨，盐六万斤，豆饼二万八千块，肥田粉两千余斤，喷雾器三个，以及布、百货等不少物资。代表情绪异常热烈，纷纷向大会要宣传品，准备回去后向全体棉农进行宣传。
