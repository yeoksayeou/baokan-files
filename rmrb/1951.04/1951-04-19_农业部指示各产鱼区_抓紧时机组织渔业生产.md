　　Ministry of Agriculture Directs Fish Producing Areas
　　Seize the Opportunity to Organize Fishery Production
    The spring fishing season has now begun in all fishing areas across the country. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government recently issued instructions requiring the people's governments and aquatic product departments in various fish producing areas to seize the opportunity to organize fishery production, strengthen the transportation and sales of fish products, and conscientiously manage state-owned enterprises to complete the annual production tasks. The instructions stated:
    First, at present, mass fishery production accounts for a large proportion of the entire fishery industry. Therefore, the focus of our work must be to vigorously organize fishermen's production and increase their enthusiasm for production. Not only should we assist fishermen in organizing cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and fishermen's associations as regular work, but we should also grasp the fishing season to help fishermen organize production, go to sea (lakes) more, and catch more fish. Whether going to sea or returning to port, we must be vigilant, always pay attention to defense, and also pay attention to inland lake and pond farming, and prohibit the use of dense-mesh nets to protect production. All relevant departments should organize temporary joint guidance organizations (such as the Shanghai Municipal Committee, etc.) as much as possible during the fishing season, concentrate their efforts to solve difficult problems in production, transportation, sales, and material supply, and appropriately adjust labor-capital relations.
    Second, fishery loans should be issued accurately and quickly to ensure timely issuance and effective use of loans. Aquatic product administrative departments must closely cooperate with banks to check the use and effectiveness of fishery loans, summarize and report on a quarterly basis; and mobilize and educate fishermen to advocate thrift and savings, and gradually achieve self-reliance and break the idea of simply relying on government loans. Regarding the allocation and sale of fish and salt, it is necessary to cooperate with relevant departments to improve the allocation and sales methods, to ensure sufficient supply, good salt allocation, and prevent embezzlement.
    Third, strengthen transportation and sales work, do a good job in market management, make full use of existing cold storage and processing equipment in various places, state-owned aquatic product enterprise departments should establish regular business relationships with cooperatives, sign entrusted processing and purchasing contracts, organize public and private forces, adjust supply and demand, reasonably control fish prices, and ensure fishermen a certain production profit. Fish market management fees should be gradually reduced. In places where market management has not been established, fish shops and fish warehouses should be persuaded to reduce commissions, strictly prohibit fraudulent weighing and price suppression, and appropriately reduce intermediate exploitation, in order to maintain production and facilitate transportation and sales.
    Fourth, conscientiously manage state-owned enterprises, implement economic accounting, rely on democratic management by workers, launch production competitions, improve technology, strive to increase production, and strive to overfulfill the 1951 production tasks.

　　农业部指示各产鱼区
　　抓紧时机组织渔业生产
    现在全国各渔区已开始春汛生产。中央人民政府农业部于日前发布指示，要求各产鱼区人民政府及水产部门抓紧时机，组织渔业生产，加强鱼货运销，并认真掌握国营企业，以完成全年生产任务，该指示称：
    第一、目前在整个渔业中群众性的渔业生产占很大比重，因此我们的工作重点，必须是大力组织渔民生产，提高渔民生产积极性：不仅将协助渔民组织合作社、互助组、渔协会作为经常工作，更应掌握渔业季节，帮助渔民组织生产，多下海（湖），多捕鱼。无论出海与回港，都必须提高警惕，时刻注意防卫，并注意内地湖塘养殖，禁止密网罟鱼，以保护生产。各有关部门尽可能在汛期组织临时联合指导机构（如海市委员会等），集中力量，解决生产、运销、物资供应等困难问题，并适当调整劳资关系。
    第二、要准确迅速发放渔贷，保证贷款及时发放和有效运用。水产行政部门必须密切配合银行，检查渔业贷款使用情况及效果，分季总结上报；并动员教育渔民，提倡节约储蓄，逐渐做到自力更生，打破单纯依赖政府贷款思想。关于渔盐配售，必须配合有关部门改进配售办法，要做到充分供应，配售好盐，并防止冲销。
    第三、加强运销工作，做好市场管理，充分利用各地原有冷藏加工设备，国营水产企业部门应与合作社建立经常业务关系，订立委托加工收购合同，组织公私力量，调剂供求，合理掌握鱼价，保障渔民一定的生产利润。鱼市场管理费应设法逐步减轻，未建立市场管理的地方，要说服鱼行、鱼栈减低行佣，严禁骗秤压价，适当减轻中间剥削，以期维护生产便利运销。
    第四、认真掌握国营企业，实行经济核算，依靠工人民主管理，展开生产竞赛，提高技术，努力增加生产，争取超额完成一九五一年的生产任务。
