Xinhua News Agency, New York, 22nd Tass: Malik, the Soviet representative to the United Nations, received on the 20th a delegation from the "American Peace Crusaders," an organization with broad influence in the United States. The delegation was led by Smith and included the well-known peace activist Robertson, Schiller, an activist from the American "National Labor Peace Conference," Lucas, the American representative to the Second World Peace Congress, and Braun and Mauhidei, representatives of the American Women's Peace Committee.

　　The delegation informed Malik of facts sufficient to prove that the American peace movement and the movement against American aggression in Korea are growing stronger. Smith read a letter from the participants of the "American Peace Crusaders" to Malik. The letter requested the United Nations to take immediate steps to hold immediate negotiations between the five major powers in order to peacefully resolve the Korean War.

　　In his reply, Malik pointed out that the United States, using its docile majority in the United Nations, has rejected proposals for a genuine solution to the Korean issue and other issues in the Far East, and has forcibly passed its own proposals in order to cover up American aggression against Korea and China.

　　Malik then exposed the attempts by the American rulers to shift the responsibility for the current international tensions onto the peace-loving people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union. They deceive the American people or deliberately distort the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union aimed at strengthening peace. Malik cited examples of how the newspapers and official propaganda of American monopolies deceive public opinion, saying: A delegation composed of more than thirty religious leaders from various states of the United States recently visited the Soviet delegation to the United Nations. During the conversation, it was discovered that not a single representative of this delegation had ever read in American local newspapers the news that the Soviet Union advocated the establishment of strict international control to ban atomic weapons; they were unaware of such a thing. They were also unaware of the various proposals for strengthening peace put forward by the Soviet Union at the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, especially the draft declaration on "Eliminating the Threat of a New War and Strengthening World Peace and Security."

　　Malik also answered in detail many questions from the delegation regarding the Soviet people's struggle for peace and the achievements of Soviet domestic peaceful construction.

　　苏联驻联合国代表马立克接见“美国和平十字军”代表团
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：苏联驻联合国代表马立克于二十日接见在美国有广大影响的“美国和平十字军”的代表团。代表团由斯密士率领，包括著名的和平战士罗伯逊、美国“全国劳工和平会议”的积极分子薛勒、美国出席第二届世界和平大会代表鲁卡丝、美国妇女和平委员会代表勃朗和毛海黛。
    代表团把足以证明美国的和平运动、反对美国侵略朝鲜运动已趋壮大的事实告知马立克。斯密士宣读了“美国和平十字军”的参加者致马立克的信。信中要求联合国立即采取步骤，立即进行五大国谈判，以便和平解决朝鲜战争。
    马立克在答复中指出：美国利用其在联合国中驯服的多数，拒绝了真正解决朝鲜问题和远东其他问题的建议，并且为了掩饰美国对朝鲜和中国的侵略，强行通过了它们的提案。
    马立克继而揭露美国统治者企图把目前国际关系紧张的责任推在爱好和平的人民民主国家与苏联头上。它们蒙蔽美国人民或故意歪曲苏联所提旨在加强和平的建议。马立克举例说明美国垄断企业的报纸与官方宣传蒙蔽舆论的实况说：由美国各州三十余位宗教领袖所组成的代表团，最近访问苏联驻联合国的代表团。在谈话中发现，这个代表团没有一个代表迄今在美国地方报纸上读到苏联赞成建立严格的国际管制以禁止原子武器的消息，他们不知道有这么一回事。他们也不知道苏联在联合国大会第五届会议中所提出的加强和平的各项建议，特别是关于“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全宣言”草案。
    马立克还详细解答了代表团关于苏联人民争取和平的斗争和苏联国内和平建设的成就的许多问题。
