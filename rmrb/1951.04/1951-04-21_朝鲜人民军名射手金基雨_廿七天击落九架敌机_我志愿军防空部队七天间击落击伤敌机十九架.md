	Sergeant Kim Ki-woo is only twenty-two years old this year. He was originally a model young farmer from Songnan Village, Nanduri District, Tanchuan County, South Hamgyong Province. On October 20th last year, he volunteered to join the army along with countless young people to defend his motherland. As a result of his hard study of shooting techniques, he became a famous marksman in just four months.
	On February 22nd this year, ten enemy fighter planes attacked a certain area of Korea. Sergeant Kim Ki-woo shot down three enemy planes with his skillful shooting techniques, and was therefore awarded the title of Hero of the Republic by the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea for the first time.
	On March 10th, ten American fighter planes again invaded the skies over a certain area and indiscriminately bombed peaceful people. Heroic marksman Kim Ki-woo calmly fought the enemy planes and shot down another three enemy planes. Two of them were hit and immediately crashed and burned, and the other crashed in a thick smoke in a certain area on the west coast.
	The success of the shooting and the glory of the title of hero did not make Sergeant Kim Ki-woo proud and complacent in the slightest. He still practiced actively and diligently as in the past, and shared his experience with his comrades.
	On March 12th, 17th, and 20th, he successively shot down three more enemy planes. That is to say, he created a brilliant record of shooting down six enemy planes in eleven days.
	The outstanding achievements of heroic marksman Kim Ki-woo made him once again awarded the title of Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on April 12th, becoming the second double hero of the Republic after General Fang Hushan. Hero of the Republic Kim Ki-woo was warmly cheered and congratulated by the people. His name is well-known and loved by all the Korean people, and he has become a banner for creating more brilliant achievements.
	Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 19th: From the 9th to the 15th of this month, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army anti-aircraft units shot down and damaged nineteen enemy planes in the skies over the front lines. Among the ten enemy planes shot down, six were B-24 and B-29 heavy bombers.

　　朝鲜人民军名射手金基雨
    廿七天击落九架敌机
    我志愿军防空部队七天间击落击伤敌机十九架
    【新华社平壤十九日电】朝鲜人民军某部对空射击组织第七组的名射手金基雨下士，因在二十七天中击落敌机九架，先后于二月二十二日和四月十二日两度荣膺朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄称号。
    金基雨下士今年仅二十二岁，原来是咸镜南道端川县南斗日区松难村的一个模范青年农民。去年十月二十日，他与无数青年一道为保卫自己祖国而志愿参军。由于他刻苦地学习射击技术的结果，仅仅四个月的时间，就成了著名的射手。
    今年二月二十二日，敌战斗机十架来袭朝鲜某地。金基雨下士以其熟练的射击技术，击落敌机三架，因而第一次荣膺朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会所授予的共和国英雄称号。
    三月十日，美国战斗机十架又侵临某地区上空，对和平人民滥施轰炸。英雄射手金基雨沉着地与敌机搏斗，再度击落了敌机三架，其中两架被打中后当即坠落焚毁，另外一架冒着浓烟落在西海岸某地。
    射击的成功和英雄称号的光荣，丝毫也没有使得金基雨下士骄傲自满。他仍和过去一样地积极苦练，并以自己的经验传播给战友们。
    三月十二日、十七日、二十日，他又连续地击落敌机三架。这就是说，他在十一天内创造了击落敌机六架的光辉纪录。
    英雄射手金基雨下士的卓越战绩，使他于四月十二日再度荣膺朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄的称号，成为继方虎山将军之后的第二个共和国双重英雄。共和国英雄金基雨受到了人民的热烈欢呼和祝贺，他的名字已为全朝鲜人民所熟知与热爱，并成为为创造更辉煌的战绩的旗帜。
    【新华社朝鲜前线十九日电】中国人民志愿军防空部队自本月九日至十五日在前线上空击落、击伤敌机十九架。在击落的十架敌机中有六架是Ｂ二四和Ｂ二九型重轰炸机。
