　　Defend World Peace Week
　　The illustrious name of the outstanding peace fighter is linked to Stalin
　　The Stalin International Peace Prize Committee held a meeting in Moscow earlier this month. The meeting decided to award the Stalin International Peace Prize for "Strengthening International Peace" to seven outstanding peace fighters who have made remarkable contributions to the struggle to maintain and consolidate peace: Joliot-Curie, Soong Ching Ling, Johnson, Mrs. Gordon, Merton, Park Chung Ae, and Yala.
　　The Soviet people congratulated the recipients of the awards. The editorial in Pravda pointed out: The struggle to defend world peace is inseparable from the illustrious name of Stalin, and the awarding of this prize is a clear demonstration of the Soviet Union's unwavering pursuit of a peace-loving policy.
　　Soong Ching Ling, Chairman of the Chinese People's Relief Administration, was awarded the Stalin International Peace Prize for her long-term contribution to the struggle for the happiness and liberation of the great Chinese people and for the cause of world peace. Soong Ching Ling's receipt of this award is not only her honor, but also the honor of the Chinese people. Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government of China, and Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, have sent telegrams to congratulate her.
　　The awarding of the Stalin International Peace Prize is an event of great significance, encouraging progressive people around the world to further strengthen the struggle to defend world peace.
　　People of all countries demand the conclusion of a peace pact
　　Peace fighters from all countries are stepping up the mass movement to demand the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers. The Japan Peace Committee held a standing committee meeting on March 14, unanimously expressed its support for the resolutions of the World Peace Council, and decided to launch a signature campaign to demand the conclusion of a peace pact. Czechoslovakia launched the "Demonstration Month for the Defense of Peace" movement on the first of this month, and more than 250,000 people participated in the signature campaign in the first week. Poland has decided to hold a "National Peace Vote" in mid-May. People in Finland, Denmark, Israel, Uruguay and other countries are also actively launching signature campaigns for the conclusion of a peace pact.
　　The Japanese people's movement against rearmament continues to rise
　　The Japanese people's patriotic movement against rearmament and demanding overall peace is continuing to develop. The Second National Conference of the National Council for Patriotic Movement for Overall Peace, held in Tokyo in early April, issued a letter to the Japanese people, pointing out that the Potsdam Proclamation made it possible to conclude an overall peace treaty with Japan, and enabled the Japanese people to gain independence and liberation. The letter to the people called on: Let everyone unite in the signature campaign to demand an overall peace treaty and oppose armament, defend peace and safeguard national independence in the face of the greatest threat of a separate treaty leading to war. The call of the National Council for Patriotic Movement for Overall Peace clearly pointed out the path for the Japanese people to defend peace and strive for national independence. The National Council for Patriotic Movement for Overall Peace has been established in eighteen major cities in Japan, and its activities are gradually penetrating into the lives of people of all strata in Japan. According to preliminary estimates, the Japanese people have collected more than 1.5 million signatures demanding overall peace and opposing rearmament.
　　People's democratic countries donate money and materials to support the Korean people
　　The heroic struggle of the Korean people against the aggression of US imperialism is a major contribution to the cause of world peace. They have received strong support and assistance from peace-loving people in all countries around the world.
　　As of March 13, donations from the Chinese people to comfort the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers and relieve Korean refugees have exceeded 83 billion yuan. Of this, 45 billion yuan has been used by the association to purchase various comfort items and relief materials such as grain and cotton, which have been shipped to Korea.
　　The people of various people's democratic countries have donated materials to help the Korean people. The Czechoslovak people donated more than 7,000 yards of woolen fabrics, 253 boxes of medicines, and 177 boxes of clothing. The Polish people donated 33 boxes of medical drugs. The Hungarian people donated a large number of woolen fabrics, cotton fabrics, blankets, and consolation bags. The people of the German Democratic Republic donated 475 boxes of medicines and clothing. The Mongolian people donated 14 carriages of comfort items such as leather jackets, cotton jackets, and leather shoes. These materials have been transported to Korea and are being distributed by the Korean government.
　　The French government unreasonably prohibits the activities of the World Peace Council
　　The flourishing world peace movement is causing increasing fear among imperialist war-mongers. The reactionary French government has unreasonably ordered the World Peace Council to be banned from operating in France earlier this month. This reactionary measure has aroused immense anger and strong protests from people of all countries. Democratic parties and people's organizations in China have issued statements or talks, unanimously lodging serious protests with the French government and demanding that the French government immediately announce the cancellation of this reactionary order. They called on people from all walks of life in China to further launch the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, actively sign the declaration demanding the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers, and fight to the end to defend world peace.
　　The French Communist Party, various French people's organizations, and local trade unions have also issued protest statements. The French Communist Party called on the people of France to oppose the government's illegal actions and to wage a comprehensive struggle to repeal this reactionary ban.

　　保卫世界和平一周
  　卓越的和平战士和斯大林的英名联在一起
    “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会于本月初在莫斯科举行会议。会议决定以“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金授予在维护与巩固和平斗争中有卓越贡献的七位和平斗士：约里奥——居里、宋庆龄、约翰逊、戈登夫人、墨尔顿、朴正爱和雅拉。
    苏联人民纷纷祝贺这次奖金的获得者。真理报发表社论指出：保卫世界和平的斗争与斯大林的英名是分不开的，这项奖金的颁发正是苏联始终不渝地奉行爱好和平政策的明证。
    我国人民救济总会主席宋庆龄，由于长期贡献她的力量为伟大的中国人民的幸福与解放、为世界的和平事业而斗争，荣获了斯大林国际和平奖金。宋庆龄荣获这项奖金，不仅是她的荣誉，而且是中国人民的荣誉。我中央人民政府政务院总理周恩来、我国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅等，均致电向她祝贺。
    颁发斯大林国际和平奖金是具有伟大意义的事件，它鼓舞了全世界进步人类更进一步加强保卫世界和平的斗争。
  各国人民要求缔结和平公约
    各国的和平战士正在加紧展开要求缔结五大国和平公约的群众运动。日本和平委员会三月十四日召开常任委员会，一致表示拥护世界和平理事会的各项决议，并决定发起要求缔结和平公约的签名运动。捷克斯洛伐克于本月一日起展开“保卫和平示威月”运动，第一周即有二十五万余人参加签名。波兰已决定在五月中旬举行“全国和平投票”。芬兰、丹麦、以色列、乌拉圭等国人民也积极展开缔结和平公约的签名运动。
  日本人民反对重新武装运动陆续高涨
    日本人民反对重新武装、要求全面媾和的爱国运动正在继续发展。四月初在东京举行的全国全面媾和爱国运动协议会第二届全国会议，发表了告日本人民书，指出波茨坦公告使缔结全面对日和约成为可能，并使日本人民能够获得独立和解放。告人民书号召：让每一个人在征集要求全面和约和反对武装的签名运动中团结起来，在面临导致战争的单独和约的最大威胁时保卫和平并保障民族的独立。日本全面媾和爱国运动协议会的号召清晰而明确地为日本人民指出保卫和平与争取民族独立的道路。全面媾和爱国运动协议会已在日本十八个重要城市建立起来，它的活动正逐渐深入到日本各阶层人民的生活中，据初步的估计，日本人民要求全面和约反对重新武装的签名已征集到一百五十万零三千余名。
  人民民主国家人民捐送款物支援朝鲜人民
    朝鲜人民反抗美帝国主义侵略的英勇斗争，是对于世界和平事业的重大贡献。他们受到全世界各国爱好和平人民的有力支持与援助。
    中国人民慰劳中朝人民战士及救济朝鲜难民的捐款，截至三月十三日止，已超过人民币八百三十余亿元。其中四百五十亿元已由本会购买各种慰劳品与粮食、棉花等救济物资运往朝鲜。
    各人民民主国家人民，纷纷捐献物资援助朝鲜人民。捷克斯洛伐克人民赠送的有毛织物七千余码，医药品二百五十三箱，衣着一百七十七箱。波兰人民赠送医疗药物三十三箱。匈牙利人民赠送了大批毛织物、棉织物、毛毯与慰问袋。德意志民主共和国人民赠送了医药品与衣服四百七十五箱。蒙古人民赠送的有皮衣、棉衣与皮鞋等慰问品十四车厢。这些物资已经运到朝鲜，正由朝鲜政府分发中。
  法国政府无理禁止世界和平理事会活动
    全世界蓬勃发展的保卫和平运动，使帝国主义战争贩子们日益恐惧。法国反动政府已于本月初无理地下令禁止世界和平理事会在法国境内活动。这一反动措施，已引起各国人民的无比愤怒与强烈抗议。中国各民主党派和各人民团体均发表声明或谈话，一致向法国政府提出严重抗议，并要求法国政府立即宣布取消这项反动命令。它们号召中国各界人民更进一步展开抗美援朝运动，积极在要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签名，为保卫世界和平而奋斗到底。
    法国共产党、法国各人民团体和各地工会也纷纷发表了抗议声明。法国共产党号召全法人民反对政府的非法行为，为撤销这个反动禁令而进行全面的斗争。
