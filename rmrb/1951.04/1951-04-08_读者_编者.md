  Comrade Wang Chun's self-criticism regarding "A History of American Aggression Against China."
    Wang Chun, the author of "A History of American Aggression Against China," sent us the following letter:
    "After reading the book review 'Review of Six Histories of American Imperialist Aggression Against China,' I am filled with shame! I actually have no research on this topic. At the time, I was editing the Workers' Daily, and felt it was necessary to tell the workers about this kind of thing, but there were no manuscripts. Therefore, I temporarily flipped through newspapers and magazines, simplified it, and published a section every day. Later, after it was finished printing (in the newspaper), letters came from readers in various places, saying it was relatively easy to understand, and requested a printed version, so the Workers' Publishing House printed an edition (10,000 copies), which has not been reprinted yet. The materials I based it on were all Liu's works, Qin's works, and the newspapers of those few days, and I really didn't do any research. The reason why some people's names are written differently from the popular versions is, I remember, also due to the influence of the materials I copied when writing. Only the date when Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, etc., was a deliberate violation, thinking that writing it like this would include his death date, so I violated historical facts. This book recently sold out 10,000 copies and is planned to be discontinued immediately.
    In addition, I really hope that a more complete "History of American Imperialist Aggression Against China" will appear, so that people who do popular propaganda have something to rely on, but there is no need to accuse it of plagiarism. This is very important."
    We must state our opinion: Comrade Wang Chun's book is very well done in terms of popularization, and it should be reprinted after some local revisions, and should not be discontinued. At the same time, so-called plagiarism should certainly not include popularization work.
  Comrade Pan Lang's explanation of "One Book Published Twice"
    Comrade Pan Lang, the translator of "The Relationship Between Urban and Rural Areas in the Soviet Union," after seeing "One Book Became Two Books" published in this column in the tenth issue of this journal, wrote to admit that "the accusations made are completely correct, and this undesirable phenomenon of 'production waste' must be eliminated as soon as possible." The letter also explained the course of events as follows:
    "In the late spring of 1949, I finished translating this essay in Hong Kong and sent it to the 'New China' magazine of the Shanghai China Book Bureau in three separate letters for publication. This was before the liberation of Shanghai. When I wrote to inquire after the liberation of Shanghai, I learned that the three letters of manuscripts had not been collected. I thought that it might have been lost, and the loss of letters was common at that time. At that time, my friend went to Beijing and took the original manuscript of my translation, introducing it to the China and Foreign Publishing House in Beijing. I didn't know if it could be published. As a result, my friend wrote my old name 'Translated by Pan Gongzhao' on it for publication. At about the same time, 'New China' in Shanghai collected the translated manuscripts sent before the liberation of Shanghai and published them as one of the series. At that time, I had returned to the liberated Guangzhou from Hong Kong.
    The responsibility should be borne by me. The main source of the error is, first of all, my persistent idea that if an article or a book is beneficial to the people, the more it is published, the better, without considering the adverse consequences it would cause to readers and publishers. Secondly, after discovering the fact that 'One Book Was Published Twice', I did not attach importance to this error and did not eliminate this error in time.
    Now, in addition to preparing to further reflect on it ideologically, I am discussing a proper handling method with the publisher and thank the readers and editors for their criticism. Because this can exempt me from errors in the future and enable those who hold the same views as me to have a correct understanding."

  王春同志对《美国侵华史话》的检讨。
    《美国侵华史话》作者王春，给了我们下面一封信：
    “读了书报评论《评六种美帝侵华史》一文，惭汗无巳！我其实对此项课题，并无研究。当时我是在编工人日报，因感必须给工人讲这一类事，而没有稿子，因此便临时翻动书报，通俗化一下，每天印发一段。后来印完了（在报上），有各地读报的来信，说比较好懂，要求印本子，所以就由工人出版社印出一版（一万册），现在尚未再印。我所根据的材料，都是刘著、钦著及那几天的报纸，实在未作过考证。其中有些人名字写得和流行的不同，记得也是受写时所抄材料影响。只有袁贼称帝时日等，则是明知故犯，以为这样写一下，连其死期都可以包进，故遂违背了史实。这一本书最近一万本已售完，拟即停印。
    另外，我确实希望能有一本比较完整的《美帝侵华史》出现，以便做通俗宣传的人有所依据，但亦不必责其有抄袭之嫌，倒是很重要的。”
    我们必须说明我们的意见：王春同志这本书在通俗化上是做得很好的，应该作局部修正后继续印行，不应该停印。同时所谓抄袭当然不应该包括通俗化工作在内。
  潘朗同志对《一书两印》的说明
    《苏联城乡关系》译者潘朗同志看到本刊第十号本栏所载《一本书变成了两本书》后，来信承认对于这一件事“所提出的责难是完全正确的，这种不应有的‘生产浪费’的现象是必须及早消灭的。”来信并说明这一件事的经过如下：
    “一九四九年春末，我在香港译竣这一篇论文，分三函寄给上海中华书局《新中华》杂志发表，这是在上海解放以前。当上海解放以后，我去信询问时，知道三封分寄的稿件没有收齐。我想，那可能是遗失了，当时信件的遗失是平常的事。那时，我的朋友到了北京，带去我译文的底稿，介绍给北京中外出版社。也不知道是否能出版。结果是由我的朋友代为写上我的旧名“潘公昭译”给出版了。差不多同一时候，上海《新中华》收齐了上海解放前寄去的译稿，又作为丛书之一而出版了。那时我已从香港回到解放了的广州。
    责任应由我负。错误的主要来源，首先是一直存在着的我的这样的一种思想：即认为如果某一篇文章或一本书，对人民是有益的，就愈多发表愈多出版愈好，而完全没有想到对读者对出版者所会引起的不良的后果。其次，是在发现了《一书两印》的事实以后，我没有重视这个错误，没有及时消除这种错误。
    现在，除了准备进一步从思想上加以检讨之外，正和出版者商量妥善处理办法，并向读者编者的指责致谢。因为这可以使我以后免除错误，并使和我抱着同样见解的人得有正确的认识。”
