    Unreasonable Restrictions on Renting Should Be Abolished
    Beijing Landlords Refuse to Rent to People with Children
    To the Editor:
        The day before yesterday, my friend and I went to Guanyinsi Hutong to look at a house. When I was negotiating the price with the landlord, the landlord suddenly asked me, "Do you have children?" I said, "Yes." The landlord said, "I won't rent it. I don't rent my house to people with children." I had no choice but to leave. Later, I looked at several other houses, and the landlords all said they would not rent to people with children.
        Editor, I don't think it's right for landlords to add this kind of restriction when renting out houses. Shouldn't people with children be able to live in houses? Who can guarantee that they won't have children themselves? I hope that the district office or police station can give appropriate education to landlords in the district who have this kind of thinking, and abolish this unwarranted restriction on renting.
                                                Gao Yi

### 租房不合理限制应取消  北京有房主不肯租房给有小孩的人

    租房不合理限制应取消
    北京有房主不肯租房给有小孩的人编辑同志：
    前天我和朋友到观音寺胡同去看房子。在我和房主洽商房价的时候，房主忽然问我：“你有小孩子吗？”我说：“有。”房主说：“不租了，我的房子不租给有小孩子的人。”我没有办法，只好退出来。后来，我又看了几处房子，房主们都说不租给有孩子的人。
    编者同志，我认为，房主出租房屋加上这种限制是不对的。有孩子的人就不应该住房吗？谁又能保证他自己不会有小孩子呢？希望区公所或派出所能够给管区内存有这种思想的房主以适当的教育，取消这种不应当有的租房限制。
                                                高邑
