Understanding the Gu Ren'en Incident
　　General Secretary of the Beijing YMCA, Gao Shangren

The Qingdao Municipal People's Government recently accepted the accusations of patriotic Christians and people from all walks of life in Qingdao and arrested Gu Ren'en, a degenerate in Christianity. This is a very gratifying event. This is the government removing a scourge for the people, and even more so, removing a great scourge for Chinese Christianity. We firmly support this wise and decisive measure by the government and hope that the government will promptly and severely punish this criminal.

The emergence of this scandal in Chinese Christianity is a great shame for us Christians. Because I am a Christian, I have felt very ashamed these past few days. Gu Ren'en, this degenerate, has insulted the Chinese Christian Church and insulted all Chinese Christians. Since he has insulted our Christianity, we should resolutely request the government to severely punish him according to the law.

In the study sessions on the mornings of March 27th and 28th, I led all colleagues of the Beijing YMCA in a discussion of the Gu Ren'en crime incident. We also read in detail "Gu Ren'en's Confession" published in the March 20th issue of *Rural Church Newsletter*. I believe that Chinese Christianity bears considerable responsibility for the emergence of such a degenerate as Gu Ren'en in Chinese Christianity. Because Gu Ren'en has been a Christian missionary for many years. Such a degenerate dares to act recklessly in broad daylight, spread rumors to confuse the public, and act as a running dog for the American imperialists, the mortal enemies of the Chinese people, and yet our Christianity has failed to sanction him earlier. This is truly regrettable. Because I am a Christian, I also bear considerable responsibility for this matter.

The "self-governance" of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement contains the meaning of "self-discipline." For a degenerate like Gu Ren'en, we Christians ourselves should have already banned him and sanctioned him. The basic principle of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement is to eliminate imperialist influence within Christianity and to raise the awareness of patriotism and love for the people among general believers. Yet, within our Christianity, there has emerged such a missionary who opposes the people and advocates for American imperialism! I repeat: Gu Ren'en is a "missionary"!

I believe that the Chinese Christian community should immediately rise up and strengthen its organization. On the basis of being organized, disciplined, and planned, we must universally and deeply eliminate imperialist influence, especially American imperialist influence, and promote the highly internationalist and patriotic spirit of Chinese Christians. Upholding the basic Christian doctrines of adhering to truth and advocating justice, we must use practice to confirm our faith.

　　对顾仁恩事件的认识
    北京市基督教青年会总干事  高尚仁
    青岛市人民政府最近接受青岛市爱国基督徒及各界人民的控告，把基督教中的败类顾仁恩逮捕了。这是一件大快人心的事。这是政府为人民除了一害，更是为中国基督教除了一个大害。我们坚决拥护政府这种英明果断的措施，并盼政府从速严惩这个罪徒。
    中国基督教中出了这件丑事，是我们基督教徒的天大耻辱。因为我是个基督徒，这几天，我心里觉着非常羞惭。顾仁恩这个败类污辱了中国基督教教会，污辱了中国所有的基督徒。他既然污辱了我们基督教，我们应坚决请求政府把他严惩法办。
    在三月二十七日和二十八日早晨的学习会中，我曾领导北京市基督教青年会全体同人漫谈顾仁恩罪恶事件。我们也详细地读了三月二十日《乡村教会通讯》上所载《顾仁恩的自供》。我认为中国基督教中出了顾仁恩这样的败类，中国基督教是负有相当责任的。因为顾仁恩是多年传教的基督教传教士。这样一个败类胆敢在光天化日之下胡作非为、妖言惑众，为中国人民的死敌美帝国主义作走狗，而我们基督教竟未能早日把他制裁，这实是一件憾事。因为我是个基督徒，因此，我也对这件事负有相当责任。
    三自运动的“自治”是含有“自制”的意义的。对于顾仁恩这种败类，我们基督教自己早就应当取缔他，制裁他。三自运动的基本方针是肃清基督教内部的帝国主义影响，和提高一般信徒的爱国家爱人民的觉悟，而我们基督教中竟出现了这样反人民为美帝国主义张目的传教士！我再重说：顾仁恩是一个“传教士”呢！
    我认为中国基督教界应当即刻起来加强组织。在有组织、有纪律和有计划的基础上，普遍深入地肃清帝国主义影响，尤其是美帝国主义影响，发扬中国基督徒高度的国际主义的爱国主义精神，在坚持真理主张正义的基督教基本教义上，用实践来证实我们的信仰。
