Australian Peace Committee Calls for Conclusion of a Peace Pact
The plenary session of the Australian National Peace Committee, held in Melbourne a few days ago, adopted a program for defending peace and issued an appeal to the Australian people on behalf of the Peace Committee regarding the general election. The appeal stated: "We demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact, and therefore have decided to issue this appeal, calling on all good men and women and all groups who strive to strengthen peace to sign this appeal. This is our paramount task during and after the election."

In its program for defending peace, the National Peace Committee strongly condemned the remilitarization of Japan and the rearmament of West Germany, considering the attempt to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan as a blatant act of betrayal and collusion with the enemy, and expressed an uncompromising opposition to any Pacific Pact. The program called for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, demanded that the Australian government immediately recognize the People's Republic of China, and allow China to take its rightful seat in the United Nations.

American Conspiracy to Persecute Korean Residents in Japan
The American occupation authorities in Japan are preparing to persecute Korean residents with democratic ideas. In the past few months, American intelligence agencies, with the assistance of the Japanese police, have arrested more than two hundred Korean patriots and imprisoned them in Sugamo Prison, falsely accusing them of collecting information about the US military stationed in Japan. The purpose of this persecution by the American authorities is to eliminate these patriots, incite distrust of Korean residents among the Japanese people, in order to drive Koreans from Japan to South Korea, and at the same time, suppress various democratic groups in Japan and push the Japanese people towards a war of aggression.

US Forcibly Conscripts Korean Residents in Japan
The United States is continuously forcibly conscripting Korean residents in Japan, giving them military training, and sending them to the Korean battlefield as cannon fodder. The training began at the beginning of the war of aggression against Korea, with the first forced training focusing on Korean students in Japan. Recently, the American occupation authorities spent eight million dollars to convert the former site of the Yokosuka former prison into a Korean puppet army barracks. Some of the puppet troops who have been trained have been sent to Korea to fight. This practice of the American aggressors will not only fail to save it from defeat, but will also arouse greater anger among the Korean people.

Protest from the Vietnamese People
Le Dinh Tham, Chairman of the Vietnam Peace Committee, sent a telegram to the World Peace Council on April 12, stating that all peace fighters and people of Vietnam are deeply angered by the French government's decision to ban the World Peace Council from operating in France. This action by the French government clearly shows that the French government has now increasingly become a lackey of American imperialism and has taken a step on the road of provoking reactionary and evil wars, a road that runs counter to the peaceful traditions and aspirations of the French people. They protested against this reactionary act of the French government and pledged to work hard to support the World Peace Council.

  澳和委会呼吁缔结和平公约
    几天前在墨尔本举行的澳大利亚全国和平委员会全体会议，通过了保卫和平纲领，并发布了和平委员会为大选事向澳大利亚人民的呼吁书。呼吁书说：“我们要求五大国缔结和平公约，因此决定发出这种呼吁书，号召力求加强和平的一切善良的男女们和一切团体，在这呼吁书上签名。这便是我们在选举期间以及在选举以后的无上重要的任务。”
    全国和平委员会在保卫和平纲领中强烈谴责使日本重新军国主义化和重新武装西德，认为企图缔结单独对日和约乃是明目张胆的背信通敌的行为，并对于任何太平洋公约表示誓不妥协的反对态度。纲领中要求一切外国军队退出朝鲜，要求澳大利亚政府立即承认中华人民共和国，并使中国取得联合国中应有的席位。
  美国迫害在日朝鲜侨民的阴谋
    在日本的美国占领当局，正在准备对有民主思想的朝鲜侨民进行迫害。在过去几个月中，美国特务机关在日本警察协助下，逮捕了两百多个朝鲜爱国者，关在巢鸭监狱中，诬指他们曾经搜集过关于驻日美军的情报。美国当局这一迫害行动的目的，是要消灭这些爱国者，并在日本人民中激起对朝鲜侨民的不信任，以图把朝鲜人从日本赶到南朝鲜去，同时也借以达到镇压日本各民主团体的目的，把日本人民推向侵略战争。
  美在日强征朝鲜侨民当兵
    美国在日本不断强征朝鲜侨民，加以军事训练，派到朝鲜战场充当炮灰。训练工作在侵朝战争之初便已开始，最先强迫集训的主要是留日朝鲜学生。最近美国占领当局花了八百万美元，将本来横须贺的前刑务所旧址改建为朝鲜伪军兵营。经过训练的伪军已有一部分被派去朝鲜作战。美国侵略者的这种做法，不但挽救不了它的失败，而且将激起朝鲜人民更大的愤怒。
  越南人民的抗议
    越南和平委员会主席黎庭探，于四月十二日致电世界和平理事会说：越南的全体和平斗士和人民，对于法国政府下令禁止世界和平理事会在法国活动的决定，深为愤怒。法国政府的这一行为明显地说明：法国政府现在已越来越成为美帝国主义的走狗，并已在挑拨反动和罪恶的战争的道路上跨进了一步，这一道路是与法国人民的和平传统与愿望背道而驰的。他们对法国政府的这种反动行为表示抗议，并保证努力支持世界和平理事会。
