Response to Criticism and Suggestions from People's Daily Readers

To the Editor:

The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on February 21st published criticism regarding our county's failure to issue preferential treatment grain to the family of revolutionary martyr Feng Zhisong. The details are as follows:

Prior to 1950, our county issued preferential treatment grain to all families of martyrs who held certificates from the troops or certificates from the martyr's colleagues and district/village, after verification. On March 2, 1950, when the Special Commissioner's Office allocated grain, it instructed: This year's preferential treatment grain should only be issued to those holding certificates from the troops; those with certificates from private individuals or district/village should not be issued for the time being, pending instructions from the Provincial People's Government. On April 18 of the same year, the Provincial Government notified us that: We have just received instructions from the Ministry of Internal Affairs that the issue of supplementary preferential treatment grain is under study; therefore, those with certificates from individual comrades should not be issued for the time being. By the time the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government promulgated the five regulations on preferential treatment, we had already been ordered to conclude the grain issuance procedures for 1950. Therefore, in 1950, preferential treatment grain was not issued to the families of revolutionary martyrs who had individual or district/village certificates.

The family of martyr Feng Zhisong came to the County People's Government to collect preferential treatment grain in March 1950. At that time, we explained the reason and did not issue it. Since then, the family has not come to collect it again. On February 24th of this year, after the Special Commissioner's Office allocated the preferential treatment grain for the first half of the year, we immediately notified the family of martyr Feng Zhisong to come and collect the preferential treatment grain. On March 14th, his family has already collected the preferential treatment grain.

　　山西孝义县人民政府对未发烈士家属优抚粮问题的说明
    编辑同志：
    二月二十一日人民日报《读者来信》栏刊载了对我县不发给革命烈士冯芝松同志家属抚恤粮一事的批评。兹将经过情形答复如下：
    我县在一九五○年以前，凡烈士家属持有部队证明或烈士同事及区村证明，经审查属实者，一律按规定发给抚恤粮。一九五○年三月二日，专署拨粮时曾指示：今年的抚恤粮，须持有部队证明者才可发给；如系私人或区村证明者暂不发给，待省人民政府指示后再说。同年四月十八日，省政府通知说：顷接内务部指示，补发抚恤粮问题，正在研究；因此个别同志证明者，暂不发给。及至中央人民政府内务部公布五个优抚条例时，我们已奉令结束一九五○年的发粮手续。故一九五○年中，对个人及区村证明的革命烈士家属，就都没发优抚粮。
    冯芝松烈士家属来县人民政府领取抚恤粮，是在一九五○年三月间。当时我们就说明原因，没有发给。此后，该同志家中也就再没来领过。到了今年二月二十四日，专署给拨下本年上半年的优抚粮后，我们即通知冯芝松烈士家属前来领取抚恤粮。三月十四日，他家已领去了抚恤粮。
