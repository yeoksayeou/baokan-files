　　The East River, West River, and Han River in Guangdong Province of the Central-South Region, the Gan River and Fu River in Jiangxi Province, and the Xiang River in Hunan Province have now entered the flood season. The water levels of the above rivers have recently risen, and some have exceeded the highest flood level or danger level for the same period in previous years. In order to strengthen flood control forces in various places and unify the command of flood control work in various places, the Central-South Military and Political Committee established the Central-South Flood Control Headquarters on April 19, according to the precedent of 1950, with Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central-South Military and Political Committee, concurrently serving as the Director of the Headquarters. The Guangdong Provincial Flood Control Headquarters and the flood control agencies of prefectures and counties along the province's major rivers have also been established successively. Hydrological stations throughout the province are reporting water conditions daily. Other provinces are also preparing to establish flood control headquarters.

　　广东江西湖南各河已入汛期
    中南区广东省的东江、西江和韩江，江西省的赣江、抚河，以及湖南省的湘江等较大江河现已进入汛期。以上各江河的水位，最近均曾上涨，有的已经超过历年同一时期的最高洪水位或危险水位。中南军政委员会为了加强各地的防汛力量，和统一指挥各地的防汛工作，已按照一九五○年成例，于四月十九日成立了中南防汛总指挥部，由中南军政委员会副主席邓子恢兼任总指挥部主任。广东省防汛指挥部及沿该省各主要江河的专区和县的防汛机构亦已先后成立。全省各处水文站已经按日报告水情。其他省份亦正准备成立防汛指挥部。
