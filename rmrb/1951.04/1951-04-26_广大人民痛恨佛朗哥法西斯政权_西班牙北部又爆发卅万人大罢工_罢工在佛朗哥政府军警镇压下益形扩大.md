　　Xinhua News Agency, 25th: Following the general strike of 300,000 workers in Barcelona in March, a large-scale strike of 300,000 workers has erupted in industrial centers in northern Spain.

　　On the morning of the 23rd, 300,000 workers in Bilbao, San Sebastián, and the provinces of Vizcaya and Guipúzcoa, the main manufacturing areas of Spain, simultaneously laid down their tools and began a 48-hour strike, protesting the high cost of living, demanding a 50% wage increase, and the implementation of price controls. Workers in steel plants, naval shipyards, explosives factories, light weapons factories, power plants, cement plants, and other various factories participated in the struggle.

　　The Franco government dispatched a large number of armed police to suppress and arrest strikers, and threatened them with dismissal and severe punishment, coercing workers to resume work at 7:00 a.m. on the 24th. However, the strike actually expanded on this day. Railway employees and insurance company workers in the provinces of Guipúzcoa and Vizcaya joined the strike; public transportation and government agencies’ employees and bank employees also engaged in slowdowns. All stores were also closed.

　　Paris' L'Humanité, commenting on the new major strike by Spanish workers, pointed out: "The struggle of the Spanish people has developed to a new stage. This developing struggle proves that the Spanish people hate the Franco regime and want to prevent the American imperialists from using them as cannon fodder."

　　广大人民痛恨佛朗哥法西斯政权
　  西班牙北部又爆发卅万人大罢工
  　罢工在佛朗哥政府军警镇压下益形扩大
    【新华社二十五日讯】继三月间巴塞罗那三十万工人总罢工之后，西班牙北部各工业中心又爆发了三十万工人的大罢工。
    在二十三日上午，西班牙主要制造业地区毕尔巴鄂城、圣塞巴斯提安城和维兹加雅及吉普斯柯亚两省的三十万工人一齐放下工具，开始举行四十八小时罢工，抗议生活费用的高涨，要求增加工资百分之五十，并实行物价管制。钢铁厂、海军造船厂、炸药厂、轻武器工厂、电力厂、水泥厂及其他各种工厂的工人们，都参加了斗争。
    佛朗哥政府调来了大批武装警察，压制并逮捕罢工者，又以解雇和严厉惩罚相恫吓，胁迫工人在二十四日上午七时复工。但罢工反而在这一天扩大开来。吉普斯柯亚和维兹加雅两省的铁路员工和保险公司工人都参加了罢工；公共交通运输事业和政府各机关的员工和银行雇员也举行怠工。各商店也关了门。
    巴黎人道报在评论西班牙工人新的大罢工时指出：“西班牙人民的斗争已经发展到新的阶段。这种发展中的斗争，证明西班牙人民痛恨佛朗哥政权，并且要阻止美帝国主义者利用他们当炮灰。”
