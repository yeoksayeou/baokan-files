　　Speech by Catholic Li Dongshan

　　Today, the Catholic Reform Promotion Association is formally established. I am very excited because our struggle against imperialism has achieved initial victory. The Chinese clergy and Catholics in Tianjin have recognized that they must sever all ties with imperialism in order to maintain the sanctity of Catholicism. The Chinese clergy and Catholics in Tianjin have further united, which is truly exciting.

　　However, we must not forget the shameless things that imperialism has done using the Holy Church, putting a dunce cap on our Holy Church. We have not yet cleansed ourselves, or even seriously begun to cleanse ourselves. The historical facts mentioned by everyone just now and the cases of imperialism using the Holy Church for espionage that have been uncovered in recent years are undeniable facts. Just a few days ago, the Public Security Bureau uncovered a spy case in our Holy Church and arrested three special agent "priests," American spies Bu Xiangxian, Bao Yihua, and Fang Ruhui. This cannot but pain us.

　　I think we should settle old scores with imperialism, and calculate how imperialism has used the Holy Church for aggression over the past few hundred years. I think this will be beneficial and harmless to us. It will certainly further encourage and strengthen our determination to fight against imperialism. If we have sores on our face, we should expose our own scars, not let others do it for us.

　　I am a Catholic from Xikai, and it is hateful that imperialist elements are still doing everything possible to undermine our anti-imperialist, patriotic, and religious loving movement today. We cannot tolerate or wait any longer. We must launch a struggle against these imperialist elements.

　　American imperialism and their running dogs are conducting activities against the Chinese people and undermining the patriotic and renovation movement in religious circles. They have published many reactionary books in Hong Kong, they are engaging in reactionary organizations within the Catholic Church, they are spreading rumors, sowing discord, and sending people into our ranks. We must be vigilant.

　　Today, as a Catholic, I hope that the clergy will bravely lead us to take action and fight against imperialism; and make a concrete work plan for truly implementing the Three-Self principles. We Catholics firmly support the Chinese clergy in leading the implementation of the Three-Self principles.

### 李东山教友讲话

　　李东山教友讲话
    今天天主教革新促进会正式成立。鄙人非常兴奋，因为我们反对帝国主义的斗争已经获得初步胜利，天津市的中国神长和教友已经认识了必须割断与帝国主义一切联系才能维护天主教的圣洁。天津市的中国神长和教友们已经更进一步团结起来了，这不能不令人兴奋。
    但是我们不能忘记，帝国主义利用圣教会所干出来的无耻事情，给我们圣教会扣上了一顶屎盆子，我们还没有洗清，甚至还没有认真开始洗刷。刚才各位谈的许多历史事实和这几年来破获的帝国主义利用圣教会搞特务的案件，都是不可辩驳的事实。就在前几天，公安局还在我们圣教会里破获了一个间谍案件，逮捕了美国间谍卜相贤、鲍翊华、房如晦三个特务“神甫”这不能不使我们痛心。
    我觉得，我们应该和帝国主义算算老账了，算算几百年来帝国主义究竟是怎么利用圣教会进行侵略的。我想，这对我们是有益无害的。它一定会更加鼓舞和坚定我们和帝国主义斗争的决心。我们脸上长了疮，我们应该自己揭自己的疮疤，不能净让人家替我们揭。
    我是西开的教友，可恨的是帝国主义分子，到今天还在百般破坏我们的反帝爱国爱教运动。我们不能容忍和等待了，我们要展开对这些帝国主义分子的斗争。
    美帝国主义和他们的走狗正在进行反对中国人民和破坏宗教界爱国革新运动的活动。他们在香港出了很多反动书，他们在天主教里搞反动组织，他们造谣，挑拨离间，派人打进我们内部，我们不能不严防。
    今天，我以一个教友的立场，希望神长们勇敢地领导我们行动起来，和帝国主义作斗争；并为真正实行三自作出具体工作计划来。我们教友是坚决拥护中国神长领导实行三自的。
