　　Enhancing Friendship Between the Chinese and Indian People

　　At a time when India is suffering from a severe grain shortage, the third shipment of rice from our country has arrived in India, and we have agreed to supply India with a further substantial amount of one million tons of grain. This fully demonstrates the care and friendship of the Chinese people and the People's Government towards the Indian people. At the same time, American imperialist elements are exploiting India's grain shortage to carry out blackmail and extortion against the Indian people. The Indian government conducted negotiations with the United States on the grain issue long before negotiating with our country. However, the United States has not only shown no intention of supplying grain to India so far, but even when the US Congress discussed this matter in March, American Congressman Vorys and others proposed using it as leverage to coerce India into supplying the United States with strategic materials (mainly uranium ore for producing atomic energy and single-crystal ore for producing jet aircraft engines), otherwise no grain would be provided. In other words, if India is unwilling to sacrifice her national sovereignty at this time, she will not receive grain from the United States. This shameless predatory tactic of the United States towards the Indian people in distress fully exposes its imperialist wolfish face. This is why the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people is increasing day by day, while anti-American sentiment among the Indian people is rising.

　　中印人民友谊的增进
    在印度粮荒严重的时候，我国第三批大米到达印度，并同意再以一百万吨的大量粮食供给印度，这充分表现了中国人民和人民政府对印度人民的关怀与友爱。而与此同时，美国帝国主义分子却在利用印度的粮荒向印度人民实行敲诈与勒索。印度政府早在与我国进行谈判之前，就与美国进行了关于粮食问题的谈判。但是，美国不但到现在为止尚无以粮食供给印度的意思，甚至在美国国会于三月间讨论这件事情的时候，就有美国众议院的议员伏利斯等提出要借此要挟印度以战略物资（主要的是生产原子能的铀矿及生产喷气飞机引擎用的单晶矿等）供给美国，否则就不给粮食。换句话说，假如印度不愿意在这时候牺牲她的国家主权的话，她就得不到美国的粮食。美国对困难中的印度人民的这种无耻的掠夺手段，充分暴露了它的帝国主义的豺狼面目。这也就是为什么中印人民之间的友谊在日益增进，而印度人民反美情绪日益高涨的缘故。
