　　The Iranian people's movement against American and British imperialism and demanding the nationalization of the oil industry is developing. Under the demands and pressure of the people, the Iranian parliament passed a resolution in March to nationalize the oil industry. The British government sent warships to the Persian Gulf in an attempt to threaten the Iranian people and prevent the implementation of the nationalization of the Iranian oil industry. American imperialism has also openly expressed great "concern" about the situation in Iran. Recently, strikes and demonstrations by workers in Abadan and other places in Iran have brought this struggle of the Iranian people to a new climax. This is a serious blow to the expansionist policies of the United States and Britain in the Middle East.
　　Iran is the largest oil-producing country in the Middle East. Since the 20th century, Iran's oil industry has been controlled by British imperialism. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company is the foundation of British economic plunder in Iran, controlling more than 100,000 square kilometers of Iran's richest oil field area, with 52.5 percent of its capital owned by Britain. Its annual output is more than 30 million tons. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, like a huge octopus, stretches out its countless tentacles, sucking Iranian oil and the blood and sweat of the Iranian people. The backwardness and stagnation of the Iranian economy and the extreme poverty of the Iranian people are the evil consequences of decades of British exploitation and plunder. Therefore, the demand for the nationalization of the oil industry has been the unswerving struggle requirement of Iranian oil workers and all patriotic people for decades.
　　If Iran nationalizes the oil industry, it will naturally be a serious blow to British imperialist economic interests in the Middle East. Like rubber in Malaya, Iranian oil is one of the lifelines of British imperialism. Therefore, on the one hand, the British government has expressed its willingness to negotiate with the Iranian government for a "reasonable" distribution of profits; on the other hand, it has sent more warships to the Persian Gulf, and has also attempted to prevent the implementation of the nationalization of the Iranian oil industry by means of transferring troops from Pakistan and Iraq for reinforcements.
　　This situation has made American imperialism, which has long coveted Iranian oil, think it is a good opportunity to fish in troubled waters. Washington has reported that the United States has suggested that Britain and Iran share the profits equally. This is naturally the United States' attempt to take advantage of this opportunity to further extend its aggressive claws into Iran. In order to negotiate on how to deal with the Iranian situation and share Iranian oil interests, the United States and Britain are conducting "consultations." The American and British imperialists are plotting to divide up Iran's oil profits and suppress the Iranian people's struggle.
　　However, the conspiracies of American and British imperialism are difficult for the Iranian people to tolerate. The Iranian people's movement demanding the nationalization of the oil industry and opposing American and British imperialism is continuing to expand. Under the leadership of the Iranian People's Party, the strength of the Iranian people is growing. They have realized that the demand for the nationalization of the oil industry and the struggle against imperialism are the struggle for national independence and the right to life. The large-scale strike movement of Iranian oil workers is a powerful answer to the conspiracies of American and British imperialism.

　　伊朗人民的反帝斗争
    伊朗人民反对美、英帝国主义、要求石油工业国有化的运动，正在发展中。伊朗议会在人民的要求与压力之下，已于三月间通过将石油工业收归国有的决议。英国政府的军舰为此开往波斯湾，企图威胁伊朗人民、阻止伊朗石油工业国有化的实行。美帝国主义对于伊朗的局势，也公开表示十分“关心”。最近伊朗阿巴丹等地工人的罢工示威运动，已使伊朗人民的这一斗争进入了新的高潮。这是对美、英在中东实行扩张政策的一个严重打击。
    伊朗是中东产油最多的国家。伊朗的石油工业，自二十世纪以来，即为英帝国主义所控制。英伊石油公司就是英国在伊朗进行经济掠夺的基础，控制着伊朗最富的油田区达十万方公里以上，其资本的百分之五十二点五为英国所有。它的年产量在三千万吨以上。英伊石油公司像一头巨大的章鱼一样，伸张着它无数的触须，吮吸着伊朗的石油与人民的血汗。伊朗经济的落后停滞与伊朗人民的极端贫困，就是英国数十年来榨取与掠夺所造成的恶果。因此，要求实行石油工业国有化一直是伊朗石油工人与所有爱国人民数十年来坚持不渝的斗争要求。
    伊朗如果实行了石油工业国有化，对于英帝国主义在中东的经济利益自然是一个严重的打击。与马来亚的橡胶一样，伊朗的石油是英帝国主义的命根之一。因此英国政府一方面表示愿与伊朗政府谈判“合理”分配利润；一方面则又增派军舰前往波斯湾，并且还以自巴基斯坦与伊拉克调遣军队增援等为手段，企图以此阻止伊朗石油工业国有化的实行。
    这种情形使得对于伊朗石油垂涎已久的美国帝国主义，认为是混水摸鱼的好机会。华盛顿传出了美国建议英国与伊朗平分利润的消息。这自然是美国想利用这个机会来把它侵略的魔手更进一步伸入伊朗。为了谈判应付伊朗局势与均沾伊朗石油利益的问题，美国与英国已在进行“协商”。美、英帝国主义是要阴谋瓜分伊朗的石油利润，镇压伊朗人民的斗争。
    但是美英帝国主义的阴谋，是伊朗人民所决难容忍的。伊朗人民要求实行石油工业国有化、反对英美帝国主义的运动，正在继续扩大展开。在伊朗人民党的领导之下，伊朗人民的力量正在成长壮大起来。他们已经认识到：要求实行石油工业国有化与反对帝国主义的斗争，就是争取民族独立与生活权利的斗争。这次伊朗石油工人规模巨大的罢工运动，就是对美、英帝国主义阴谋一个有力的答复。
