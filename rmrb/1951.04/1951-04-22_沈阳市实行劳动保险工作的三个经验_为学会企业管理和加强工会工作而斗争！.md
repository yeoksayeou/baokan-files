Three Experiences of Shenyang City in Implementing Labor Insurance Work
Strive to Learn Enterprise Management and Strengthen Trade Union Work!
Jin Lijing

　　Shenyang City began implementing labor insurance on April 1, 1949. As of now, 145 state-owned factories and units in the city, with a total of 115,108 people, have implemented labor insurance (accounting for 92.57% of the total number of people in state-owned and public factories and units in the city), and 20,659 people have enjoyed the benefits of the labor insurance fund. After the specific problems and difficulties of the employees were resolved, their political awareness and production enthusiasm significantly improved. Over the past two years, Shenyang City has gained the following three experiences in implementing labor insurance work:

　　When starting to implement labor insurance, it is essential to do sufficient publicity and preparatory work. When Shenyang City started implementing labor insurance, it specifically held labor insurance cadre training classes, and newspapers also did a lot of publicity, praising the railway department for its good implementation of labor insurance and criticizing the military supplies system for its poor implementation of labor insurance. Within each factory, the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League cooperated to educate employees about labor insurance. After repeated publicity and education, many workers understood labor insurance. Some workers said, "In the past, no one cared about workers' birth, old age, sickness, and death. Now with labor insurance, there is nothing to worry about." In particular, older workers were very moved, thinking, "Having labor insurance is more reliable than having a son." Therefore, the workers' production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. In the past, the knitting factory could only weave an average of 50 towels per person per day. After implementing labor insurance, the number of towels woven per person per day increased to 70.

　　To ensure that labor insurance work can truly promote employees' production, the trade union must actively and proactively carry out mass work and provide active care, consideration, and assistance to employees' birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, and disability. This experience has been proven in many factories in Shenyang. For example, Zhao Chuntian, a 63-year-old technician at the Fifth Machine Factory, was not active in his work in the past and rarely went to the production site. When the trade union issued him a pension, it held a respect-for-the-elderly meeting to show him care and consideration. Zhao Chuntian was greatly moved. He said at the respect-for-the-elderly meeting, "I have never seen such a thing in my entire life. In the past, people like us were unwanted. Now the higher authorities are giving pensions, only the Communist Party can do this. In the future, I will definitely contribute all my skills." From then on, he worked very actively, went to the production site himself, transformed the gear shaper, researched and invented safety air tanks and milling cutter grinders, and transformed gear grinders and gear shaving machines, receiving six awards.

　　Yang Qingquan, a worker at the Glucose Workshop of the Northeast Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, used to be cynical and ideologically backward. Later, he fell ill, and the comrades responsible for labor insurance, the chairman of the trade union, and the secretary of the Party branch all came to see him with concern. From then on, his work attitude completely changed, and he promoted the progress of the backward workers who were close to him in the past, and promoted his own group into a model group.

　　To do a good job in labor insurance work, it is essential to have a sound labor insurance committee organization and leadership, and to establish various necessary working systems. This issue has had very painful experiences and lessons in Shenyang. When Shenyang City started implementing labor insurance, it was a vigorous effort, which played a certain role in improving workers' awareness and developing production work. However, due to the unsound organization (the labor insurance committee was not elected and lacked mass participation), many necessary working systems were not established (such as budget, final accounts, physical examination, medical evaluation, and supervision systems). In addition, the trade union lacked understanding of labor insurance and relaxed its leadership, so that labor insurance in many factories did not play its due role in production, and there were many problems. The labor insurance work of the First Machine Factory was very bad in the past. The workers had no impression of labor insurance, the accounting system was very chaotic, and a lot of money was lost. Nearly half of the people were not registered for labor insurance. Such situations were quite common in Shenyang. However, there were also factories with relatively good labor insurance work, such as the Dyeing Factory. They had democratically elected labor insurance committees from the factory to the workshop, and the chairman of the trade union personally served as the director of the committee, and the group had labor insurance representatives. The working system was sound, and the division of labor was clear. They carefully carried out mass visits to every sick and injured employee. Due to the development of medical supervision work, doctor Ping was elected to the labor insurance committee. He went to the production site and dormitory day and night to treat employees. He won the support of all employees in the factory. When making budgets and final accounts, it is necessary to carefully understand the situation of the masses. Doing so is the equivalent of formulating a labor insurance work plan. The factory also has a regular system for physical examinations for employees. If it is found that an employee's body is not suitable for a certain job, the labor insurance committee will put forward its opinion and suggest that the administration transfer the employee to a suitable job, and the transferred employee is also very satisfied. Because the labor insurance organization and work of the factory are relatively sound and in-depth, it has played a great role in promoting production.

　　沈阳市实行劳动保险工作的三个经验
　  为学会企业管理和加强工会工作而斗争！
　　金力静
    沈阳市是在一九四九年四月一日开始实行劳动保险的。截至现在为止，全市一百四十五个公营工厂和单位，共有十一万五千一百零八人实行了劳动保险（占全市国营公营工厂和单位人数百分之九十二点五七），有两万零六百五十九人享受了劳动保险基金的待遇。职工的具体问题和困难得到解决后，政治觉悟和生产积极性显著提高。两年以来沈阳市在实行劳动保险工作中，获得了以下三点经验：
    在开始实行劳动保险时，一定要做充分的宣传准备工作。沈阳市在开始实行劳动保险时，曾专门举办了劳动保险干部训练班，报纸也做了很多宣传，表扬了实行劳动保险较好的铁路部门，批评了实行劳动保险较差的军需系统。在各工厂内，党、行政、工会、青年团一致配合，对职工进行了劳动保险的教育。经过反复的宣传教育，许多工友对劳动保险有了认识，有的工友讲：“过去工人生老病死无人管，现在有了劳动保险，什么也不愁了。”特别是老年工友很受感动，认为：“有了劳动保险，比有儿子还牢靠。”因此，工人的生产情绪空前提高了。针织厂过去每人每日平均只能织五十条毛巾，实行劳动保险后，每人每日所织毛巾增加到七十条。
    要使劳动保险工作能真正推动职工搞好生产，工会必须积极主动地进行群众工作，对职工的生老病死伤残给以主动的关心体贴和帮助。这一经验在沈阳很多工厂都得到了证明。如第五机器厂有位六十三岁的老技术员赵春田，过去工作不积极，很少下现场。工会给他发养老金时，举行了敬老会，对他表示关心和体贴。赵春田大为感动，他在敬老会上说：“我活了一辈子也没有见过这样的事。在以前，像咱这样的人，已经是没人要的了。现在上级还给养老金，真是只有共产党才能这样做。以后我一定要把我的技术都拿出来。”从此以后，他工作非常积极，亲自下现场，改造了插齿机，研究发明了保险风罐、铣刀研磨机，改造了磨齿机、铲齿机等工具，得到了六次奖励。
    东北化学制药厂葡萄糖场工友杨清泉，原来好说怪话，思想很落后。后来他病了，负责劳动保险工作的同志、工会主席、党的支部书记都很关心地来看他。从此他的工作态度完全转变，而且推动了过去和他接近的落后工友一同进步，并推动了他自己的小组变成了模范组。
    劳动保险工作要想办好，一定要有健全的劳动保险委员会的组织领导，并建立各种必要的工作制度。这一问题在沈阳是有很惨痛的经验教训的。沈阳市在开始实行劳动保险时轰轰烈烈，对提高工友觉悟与开展生产工作上，也曾起了一定的推动作用。可是由于组织不健全（劳动保险委员会未经过选举，缺乏群众性）。许多应有的工作制度没建立（如预决算、检查身体、医疗评定和监督制度等）。再加上工会对劳动保险认识不足，放松领导，以致后来有很多工厂的劳动保险在生产中没发挥应有的作用，而且存在的问题非常多。第一机器厂劳动保险工作，在过去就是很糟糕的。工友对劳动保险无印象，会计制度很紊乱，并丢失了很多钱，差不多有一半人未进行劳动保险登记等，像这样的情况在沈阳相当普遍。但是也有劳动保险工作比较好的，例如：染料厂，他们从工厂到车间，都有真正民主选举的劳动保险委员会，工会主席亲自兼任了主任委员，小组有劳动保险代表。工作制度健全，分工明确，他们对于每一个病伤职工，都认真地进行群众性的慰问。该厂由于医疗监督工作的开展，医生平某被选入劳动保险委员会。他不论白天黑夜都深入到现场和宿舍为职工治病。获得了全厂职工的拥护。做预决算时先要认真了解群众情况，这样做预算即等于制定了劳动保险工作计划。该厂并有定期的为职工检查身体的制度，发现了某个工友身体不适合于某个工作岗位，劳动保险委员会即提出意见，建议行政调换适当的工作岗位，被调换的工友也很满意。由于该厂劳动保险的组织与工作都比较健全深入，在生产中起了很大推动作用。
