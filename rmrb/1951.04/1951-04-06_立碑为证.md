Erecting a Monument as Proof
    Ding ?, Professor of the 工学院 [Engineering Institute] of North China University

    In Xiaoyukou, Yinzhen District, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, the landlord brothers Li Xiantong and Li Xianshun were extremely cruel in oppressing and exploiting the peasants before liberation. At the struggle meeting, the deeds and account books handed over by their family formed a pile several feet high, containing countless stories of the peasants' blood and tears. This large pile was burned in public, but the peasants were still uneasy, fearing that the landlord's family still had hidden deeds that had not been handed over, which could cause trouble in the future. Therefore, they demanded that the landlords guarantee that the unsubmitted documents would no longer be valid. The peasants themselves devised a method to have the landlords erect a monument, on which was written:

    Our family is a feudal exploiting landlord family that has lived by exploiting the people in the past. We have committed great sins through refusing to return land redemption, refusing to write off debts. Now, after the Farmers' Association reasoned and struggled with us, all the remaining deeds and account books have been handed over, and the remaining unsubmitted deeds and account books are completely invalid. From now on, we are willing to abide by government laws under the leadership of the People's Government and the Farmers' Association and start anew. Fearing that there would be no proof in the future, we erected this monument as proof.

    This monument is a creation of the peasants' wisdom, recording this epoch-making event—the land reform and the liberation of the peasants. This inscription evokes feelings of both excitement and solemnity; but behind each word is a history of feudalism, which has only now entered a new page under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

    In the past, the words of peasants were never inscribed on steles. They either praised the merits of autocratic monarchs or promoted the chastity and filial piety of feudal morality. When rich and powerful landlords' family members died, they always erected a tombstone to record the start and end dates of their personal exploitation career and the degree of their exploitation.

    Now, for the first time, there is a monument of their own made by the peasants themselves, "Fearing that there would be no proof in the future, we erected this monument as proof," using this monument to prove the eternal demise of the landlord class.

    This monument is a record of a revolutionary milestone, and its value cannot be compared with any ancient stele in the Stele Forest [Beilin] (Note). It is worth preserving carefully and keeping as a permanent memorial to the peasants' liberation.

    [Note] The Stele Forest is in Xi'an and is the place in China with the largest collection of ancient steles.

　　立碑为证
    华北大学工学院教授　丁?
    陕西长安县引镇区小芋口有地主李宪通和李宪顺兄弟二人，解放前对农民欺压剥削，十分凶恶。在斗争大会上，由他们家里交出的契约账本，就有几尺高一大堆，其中不知有多少农民的血泪故事。这一大堆当众烧了，但是农民们仍放不下心，怕地主家里仍有隐藏未交出的，将来再生事故；因此一定要地主保证，未交出的不再有效；并由农民自己想出一个办法，要地主立了一碑，碑上写道：
    我家是封建剥削的地主家庭，过去靠剥削人民过生活；赎地不退约，还债不勾账，罪恶重大。今经农会说理斗争，所存契约账本完全交出，其余未交出的契约账本，一律无效。今后愿在人民政府及农会领导下，遵守政府法令，从新做人。恐后无凭，立碑为证。
    这碑是农民智慧的创造，记下了这件划时代的大事——土地改革，农民翻身。这碑文读来有兴奋又有庄严的感觉；但在每个字的后面，是一部封建的历史，如今在毛主席和共产党的领导之下，历史才转入了新的一页。
    以前的碑石上面，从来不曾刻上过农民的话。不是歌颂专制君王的功德，就是宣扬封建道德的贞孝，有钱有势的地主家人死了总要刻一块墓碑，记下他们个人剥削生涯的起讫年月和剥削的显赫程度。
    如今，才第一次有了农民自己的碑，“恐后无凭，立碑为证”，用这碑来证明地主阶级的永远灭亡。
    这碑是一个革命里程的记录，它的价值不是碑林（注）中的任何古碑可以比拟的，值得我们好好保存起来，留作农民翻身的永久纪念。
    【注】碑林在西安，是中国集有古碑最多的地方。
