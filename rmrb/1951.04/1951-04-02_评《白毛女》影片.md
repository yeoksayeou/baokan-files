　　Review of the Film "The White Haired Girl"
    Zhou Weizhi
    The story of "The White Haired Girl" was widely circulated in the vast villages of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region during the early period of the War of Resistance Against Japan. This folk tale illustrates that the toiling masses of China, though exploited, humiliated, and harmed in the dark and lengthy feudal society, were uncompromising and unyielding. Their boundless aspiration and conviction for a bright future inspired their iron-like fighting will. The White Haired Girl is not just an ordinary sufferer but the embodiment of the Chinese working people's spirit of resistance against feudal forces and their unwavering perseverance. The broad masses used their blood and tears to write this touching story, shaping this heroic image who endured all kinds of torment and yet remained extraordinarily tenacious. Many anti-feudal folk legends of the past could only place hope in beautiful imaginations; Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai could turn into white cranes or butterflies and fly to the heavens together, while Ma Wencai was buried alive in a cracked tomb. However, "The White Haired Girl" concludes with the arrival of the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, liberating the working masses and thus rescuing herself. Through this realistic and romantic ending, they denounce the old society and praise the earth-shaking victorious struggle, celebrating their own liberation.
    The opera adapted from the story of the White Haired Girl is successful. It uses the poetry and songs of the masses to vividly and centrally express the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese working people, praising Xier's tenacious character: "Water that cannot be scooped dry, fire that cannot be extinguished," "I want revenge, I want to live!" The Chinese people finally stood up under the leadership of the Communist Party, and "The White Haired Girl" also "got her grievances redressed under the sun!" This excellent opera has been staged countless times across the country, loved by the broad masses of people, inspiring them to struggle forward, and playing a great educational role.
    The film "The White Haired Girl" is basically adapted from the opera, but it also makes many important additions and deletions, which compensate for certain deficiencies in the original play in fully developing the unyielding character of "The White Haired Girl." This makes the White Haired Girl's tenacious character more completely depicted, and the fighting spirit of the Chinese people more powerfully displayed.
    First, in the original play, after the White Haired Girl was raped by Huang Shiren, she was "like a broken branch passing under a stone," and her will to resist was not clearly expressed. When Huang Shiren deceived her, she even harbored illusions about him, thinking that a rich man would truly love a poor girl like her; thinking that since she was already disgraced, she might as well stay with Huang Shiren. It was not until Auntie Er exposed the deception that she realized she had been tricked and thought of resisting. This handling of the situation is very inappropriate. Because the Xier we want to portray is a typical example of an excellent poor peasant daughter. The masses, through the legend of "The White Haired Girl" and through their own revolutionary romantic imagination, express their own brave and fighting character. Therefore, Xier is by no means an isolated poor peasant daughter, let alone the kind of unpromising girl who is easily deceived and willing to endure humiliation without any class consciousness. To depict her having such illusions about the vicious class enemy Huang Shiren cannot but be said to be a distortion of Xier's character, harming the self-esteem of the working people, and seriously damaging the entire theme. Even aside from the theme of "The White Haired Girl," from the general perspective of "human nature," Huang Shiren is a tyrant, a representative of the vicious landlord class. He not only exploits the fruits of the peasants' labor, but also forces the White Haired Girl's father, Yang Bailao, to his death in the snow; he breaks up the love and happy life of Xier and Dachun, and Xier herself is abused by him, living a life of slavery like a beast. Xier is full of hatred for Huang Shiren, how could she endure humiliation and have illusions about Huang? Perhaps some poor peasant daughters may have such wrong ideas after all hope is lost, but this is by no means the content that this play is required to express. It is completely correct to delete it in the movie.
    In order to strengthen the expression of Xier's rebellious character, the film adds many important plots. It explains that after Xier was violated, she failed to escape with Dachun, was beaten into the mill by Huang Shiren and suffered. The beautiful and innocent little girl was tortured beyond recognition in heavy labor, but she was not a weak woman who couldn't lift her head because she was ravaged by Huang Shiren. She never despaired, and she believed that Dachun would definitely come back. This belief supported her, enabling her to endure all unimaginable pain and torture, to fight against nature and wild beasts in the deep mountains, to persevere in hardship for several years, and to live tenaciously even with her hair turned white, looking forward to the arrival of happiness. Therefore, increasing the scenes of Xier suffering in Huang's mill and struggling hard in the cave not only deepens people's sympathy for Xier, but most importantly, it more meticulously and vividly expresses the strong perseverance of the Chinese working people. They are unyielding, fight to the end, and finally achieve victory, giving people infinite confidence and encouragement. This is precisely the expression of the masses' revolutionary spirit and optimism.
    Second, the film also provides a more vivid depiction of the love life between Dachun and Xier. They love labor, love each other, and are willing to build a happy life through hard work. On the eve of her marriage, Xier cut out the characters for "double happiness" (囍) and mandarin ducks, and pasted them on the window of the new house; she combed her hair into a bun and put on the velvet flower given to her by Dachun. She smiled and sang softly. Her mood, full of sweet imagination, allows the audience to feel the atmosphere of happiness. But she never expected that she was already in Huang Shiren's vicious plan, and was finally captured into Huang's mansion on the first day of the new year, and her happy life was brutally destroyed. This strong contrast leaves a deep impression. The pure love between Xier and Dachun is indelible. After Xier arrives at Huang's house, she never forgets Dachun. She says, "Born as a member of the Wang family, die as a ghost of the Wang family." This must not be regarded as feudal ethical thought, but precisely represents the pure love between working people. Her using shoes to express her deep affection for Dachun is also reasonable, touching, and relatable. Especially after the final struggle against Huang Shiren, a scene of Dachun and Xier working together appears. Xier has combed her hair into a bun, indicating that she has married Dachun. She still lives and works as innocently and happily as before, and her white hair has turned black. Her beautiful and moving image reappears in front of the audience, no longer a disheveled, barefoot "white-haired ghost." The film ends here, indicating that the era in which Xier was insulted and harmed has passed, and the happy life of the Chinese people has arrived. It gives the audience a complete feeling. This is where the editors and directors are successful.
    Third, regarding the handling of the child in "The White Haired Girl," the film shows that Xier had a miscarriage due to overwork after escaping from Huang's house, and the child died soon after. I think this is also a very good change. The original legend also said that the child had died long ago, or that the child died after seeing the sun. This shows that the masses, starting from class sentiments, do not like the child to survive. Some may argue that the child is of course innocent, and maternal love cannot be erased, and that it would not matter if the child survived until after liberation. However, since this child is an "illegitimate child," a result of class oppression, its existence can only stimulate the deep pain in the White Haired Girl's heart and is by no means a symbol of the mother's happiness. We have no reason to make the audience pity this child, or to be interested in this child when watching the performance. We also do not need to use the child's affairs to arouse the audience's sympathy for the White Haired Girl, which is counterproductive. From the perspective of the entire plot development, the existence of the child is completely unnecessary; the child's death can eliminate Xier's emotional entanglement, remove the mark left by past painful encounters, and allow her to live a healthier life, which is beneficial to expressing Xier's steadfast spirit. Therefore, such a modification should be said to be very reasonable.
    In addition, due to the absence of stage limitations, the film not only shows Huang Shiren's persecution of Yang Bailao, Xier, and Dachun, but also writes about the vast numbers of poor peasants being oppressed and bullied by landlords and tyrants, working as slaves for landlords all their lives, and eventually dying in poverty. These places make the class relationship between feudal forces and the oppressed peasants more fully expressed.
    The director's style of this film is very simple and powerful, without any relaxation from beginning to end. He used many contrasting techniques, such as the rich living in tall buildings and the poor being like cattle and horses, giving people a strong impression. Several main actors also performed appropriately, maintaining a realistic performance style. In many places, the tunes from the original play were used, and some new solos and choruses were composed, which mostly have the characteristics of national music, enriching the expression of the characters' emotions and sounding very familiar. This is a rare achievement in the music of general state-owned films.
    In short, this film has high achievements in both ideology and art, and it is truly an improvement on the basis of the original play. However, there are also some places that are not as good as the original play or deserve to be strengthened, such as the relationship between Yang Bailao and Xier not being as moving as in the original play. Before Yang Bailao's death, the inner conflicts were not depicted deeply enough, and the audience's emotions were interrupted by his singing. After his death, Xier's grief, Dachun's, and the masses' anger lack powerful expression and are not moving enough. Also, when Dachun came back, he only said a few words to his mother, and his relationship with the masses was not enthusiastic enough. Because the masses pinned their hopes of revenge on Dachun, that is, on the Red Army. Now that Dachun is back, the emotions should be excited and enthusiastic, but the scene is very flat. The final struggle scene also passed very simply, and the power of the masses and the joy after victory should be strengthened.
    Some places where singing is used hinder the development of emotions and sound very discordant, such as the part where Xier cries and sings while lying on her father's corpse and the part where Yang Bailao sings before his death. But I think this is a matter of how to cooperate with the needs of the plot in the future, and more appropriately use singing to deepen the expression of emotions. It is not a contradiction of the whole content and form, or a contradiction between the film form and the singing form, because in some places singing is used which is not normally used in real life, but it does not feel uncoordinated.

　　评《白毛女》影片
    周巍峙
    《白毛女》故事，在抗日战争初期，盛传于晋察冀边区广大乡村。这个民间故事说明了中国的劳苦群众在阴暗而又漫长的封建社会里，虽然是被压榨，被污辱与被损害的，但她（他）们却是不妥协不屈服的；对于未来美满生活的无限热望与确信，鼓舞着她（他）们钢铁一般的斗争意志。白毛女不是一般的受难人物，而是中国劳苦人民反抗封建势力，坚贞不屈的奋斗精神的体现者，广大人民用自己的血和泪，来抒写这个可歌可泣的故事，塑造这个受尽折磨而又顽强万分的英雄形象。过去许多反封建的民间传说，只能把希望寄托在美丽的想像上面，梁山伯、祝英台可以变成白鹤或蝴蝶双双飞上天，而把马文才活埋在裂破的坟墓里；而白毛女却是以共产党八路军到来，解放了劳苦群众，因而也救出了自己作结束，他们通过这个既现实又浪漫的结局来控诉旧社会，歌颂翻天覆地的胜利斗争，歌颂自己的解放。
    根据白毛女故事编成的歌剧是成功的，它用群众的诗与歌声，生动而集中地表现了中国劳苦人民这种革命精神，歌颂了喜儿那种“舀不干的水，扑不灭的火”，“我要报仇我要活！”的顽强性格。中国人民终于在共产党的领导下，站立起来了，“白毛女”也在“太阳底下把冤伸”了！这一优秀的歌剧曾在全国上演无数次，为广大人民所热爱，鼓舞人民斗争前进，发挥了伟大的教育作用。
    《白毛女》影片基本上是根据歌剧改编，但也作了不少重要的增删，它使原剧在完成《白毛女》这个不屈服的性格方面所存在的某些缺陷得到弥补。这样就使《白毛女》的顽强性格得到更圆满的描绘，中国人民的斗争精神得到更有力的发挥。
    第一、在原剧中白毛女被黄世仁奸污后，是“压折的树枝石头底下过”，反抗的意志表现得不够鲜明，而在黄世仁骗她时，她竟对黄寄与幻想，以为富人真会爱她这样一个穷女孩子；以为自己既已见不得人，不如跟黄世仁过下去，也就算了。直到二婶子给揭破以后，她才知道是受骗了，才想到反抗。这个地方的处理是十分不妥当的。因为我们所要表现的喜儿是优秀的贫农女儿的典型，群众通过《白毛女》的传说，通过自己革命浪漫主义的想像，来表现自己勇敢斗争的性格，因此喜儿绝不是个别的贫农女儿，更不是那种毫无阶级意识那样易于受骗，甘于忍辱偷生的没出息的女孩子，描写她对凶恶的阶级敌人黄世仁产生那样的幻想不能不说是歪曲了喜儿的性格，伤害了劳动人民的自尊心，对整个主题思想也是严重的损害。就是撇开“白毛女”主题思想不谈，单从一般“人情”来看，黄世仁是恶霸，是凶毒的地主阶级的代表，他不仅剥削农民的劳动果实，他更逼死白毛女的父亲杨白劳，凄凄惨惨地死在雪地里；他拆散喜儿和大春的爱情与幸福生活，而喜儿自己又被他糟蹋了，过着牛马般的奴隶生活。喜儿对于黄世仁满怀仇恨，她怎会忍辱屈就，对黄存幻想呢？也许有个别贫农的女儿在一切绝望以后，可能存在这种错误念头，但这也绝非本剧所要求表现的内容。在电影中把它删掉了，我认为是完全正确的。
    为了加强喜儿这种反抗性格的表现，在影片中增加了许多重要的情节，它说明喜儿被污辱后，随大春逃走没有成功，被黄世仁打入磨房受苦，美丽天真的小姑娘，在繁重的劳动中被折磨得不成人样，但她不是一个因被黄世仁糟蹋而抬不起头来的弱女，她从不绝望，她相信大春一定会回来的。这种信念支持着她，使她能够忍受一切不可想像的痛苦与折磨，能够在深山里与自然界、与野兽作斗争，困苦坚持好几年，把头发都熬白了，还是刚毅顽强地生活下去，期待着幸福的到来。因此增加喜儿在黄家磨房受罪，在山洞苦斗的场面，不仅加深了人们对于喜儿的同情，最主要的是它更细致、更形象地表现了中国劳动人民的坚强毅力，她（他）们不屈不挠，奋斗到底，最后终于获得胜利，给与人们无限的信心与鼓励。这正是群众革命精神与乐观主义的表现。
    第二、关于大春与喜儿的爱情生活，在电影中也有着比较生动的描绘。他俩热爱劳动，相亲相爱，愿意在勤苦劳动中建立起幸福的生活。喜儿在结婚前夜，剪着囍字和鸳鸯，贴在新房的窗上；她梳起发髻，插上大春赠给她的绒花。她微笑着，低声唱着。她那充满甜蜜想像的心情，使观众们也能感受到那种幸福的气氛。但她绝没有想到她早已在黄世仁的恶毒计算之中，终于在年初一被抓进黄门，幸福的生活遭到横暴的破坏。这种强烈的对比，给人深刻的印象。喜儿和大春之间的纯真的爱情是永远不可磨灭的。喜儿到黄家以后，念念不忘大春，她说：“生为王门人，死为王门鬼”。这绝不能认为是封建的礼教思想，而正是表示劳动人民之间纯真的爱情。她用鞋子寄托对于大春的深情，也都是合情合理、亲切动人。特别在最后斗争黄世仁以后，出现了大春与喜儿在一起劳动的镜头，喜儿已梳起了发髻，表示已和大春结婚了。她仍像从前那样天真而愉快地生活着，劳动着，白的头发也变黑了。她那美丽动人的形象，又重现在观众面前，再不是什么披发赤足的“白毛鬼”了。电影在这里结束，说明喜儿被污辱、被损害的时代已过去了，中国人民的美满生活已经降临。它给予观众一种完满的感觉。这是编导同志成功的地方。
    第三、关于《白毛女》小孩的处理问题，在影片中是表现喜儿逃出黄家后因过分疲劳小产了，这小孩不久也就死去。这一点我认为也改的很好。原来传说中也都说小孩子早已死了，或者说小孩子见到太阳后就死了。这说明群众从阶级情感出发，并不喜欢小孩子生存下去。也许有人认为，小孩子当然是无辜的，母爱是不能抹煞的，小孩生存到解放以后似乎并无大碍。但是，这孩子既是“孽种”，是阶级压迫的结果，他的存在只能刺激白毛女心灵深处的隐痛，绝不是母亲幸福的象征。我们没有理由使观众怜惜这个孩子，或者在看演出时对这孩子发生兴趣。我们也不必用小孩子事引起观众对白毛女的同情，那是适得其反的。而从整个情节发展来看，小孩的存在完全没有必要；小孩死了，可以免去喜儿在情感上的牵扯，去掉过去痛苦遭遇所遗留下来的烙印，使她能更健全地生活下去，对表现喜儿的坚贞精神方面有好处。因此，这样修改应该说是很合理的。
    此外，由于没有舞台的限制，在电影中不但表现了黄世仁对杨白劳、喜儿和大春他们的迫害，同时还写出广大贫苦农民都受到地主恶霸的压榨与欺凌，一辈子为地主当牛当马，最后在贫困中死去。这些地方使得封建势力与被压迫的农民的阶级关系，得到更充分的表现。
    本片的导演作风十分朴实有力，从头到尾毫不松懈。他采取了很多对比的手法，如富人坐高楼，穷人如马牛等等，给人强烈的印象。几个主要演员也表演得恰如其分，保持着现实主义的表演风格。在许多地方采用了原剧的曲子，并新编了一些独唱与齐唱，大都能具有民族音乐的色彩，使角色的情绪得到更丰富的表现，听起来十分亲切。这是一般国营影片音乐中很少有的收获。
    总而言之，这部电影无论在思想上与艺术上都有高度的成就，真正是在原剧的基础上提高了一步。但也有一些地方不如原剧或值得加强的地方，如杨白劳与喜儿的关系不如原剧动人。在杨白劳死前，其内心的矛盾，描绘不够深刻，观众的情感却被他的歌声打断了。在他死后，喜儿的悲恸、大春及群众的愤恨，缺乏有力的表现，不够感动人。还有在大春回来时，仅跟母亲说了几句话，他与群众间的关系不够热烈。因为群众们是把报仇的希望寄托在大春身上，也就是寄托在红军身上。现在大春回来了，情绪应该激动与热烈，而在镜头上则表现很平淡。最后斗争场面也很简单地过去了，群众的力量与胜利后的愉快，还应加强一些。
    有些运用唱歌的地方，妨碍了情绪的发展，听起来很不协和，如喜儿伏在父亲尸体上哭唱的一段以及杨白劳死前唱歌的部分都有此感觉。但我认为这是今后如何配合剧情需要，更恰当地运用歌声以加深感情的表达问题，不是整个内容与形式矛盾，或电影形式与歌唱形式的矛盾问题，因为有好些地方用了并非生活中应有的歌声而并不感到不调和。
