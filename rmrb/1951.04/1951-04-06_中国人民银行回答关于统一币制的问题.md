Editor's Note: To meet the needs of national economic construction and facilitate the exchange of goods throughout the country, the State Council of the Central People's Government has issued an order to unify the currency system and recall the local currency notes issued by the Northeast Bank and the Inner Mongolia People's Bank. Since the State Council officially announced the order on April 1st, the Head Office of the People's Bank of China has received a number of inquiries, and the bank has now provided a comprehensive response as follows:

Q: After the establishment of the Central People's Government, many local currencies were gradually unified. Why was the currency unification in the Northeast region delayed?

A: The main reason for the delay in currency unification in the Northeast region was based on the necessities of the time. Because the Northeast region was liberated earlier, had a better production base, and prices had stabilized first; while at this time the liberation war in the interior had not yet completely ended, and efforts were still needed to stabilize prices. In order to protect the Northeast region from the impact of the war and unstable prices in the interior, to enable it to restore production and carry out construction as soon as possible, and to better support the whole country financially and economically with the existing foundation in the Northeast, the Central People's Government decided to temporarily maintain the original currency system in the Northeast, even though many other local currencies had been gradually unified. Facts have proven that this measure was completely correct and necessary at the time.

Q: What is the basis for calculating and setting the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the Northeast circulating notes and the Inner Mongolia circulating notes at one yuan to nine yuan and five jiao?

A: The exchange rate between the Renminbi and the Northeast circulating notes and the Inner Mongolia circulating notes, set at one yuan to nine yuan and five jiao, is mainly based on the theoretical exchange rate of the main goods exchanged between the interior and the exterior, in representative locations such as Shenyang in the Northeast and Tianjin in North China, weighted by the trade conditions of both sides, and with reference to the exchange situation of the joint office of the People's Bank of China Shanhaiguan Northeast Bank. It was determined according to the following principles: (1) After the exchange rate is set, it should not cause general price fluctuations on either side. (2) Take into account the different and greater needs of both sides in the exchange of goods. (3) Facilitate the mutual assistance and development of both sides in future production and construction.

Q: After the currency system is unified, what is the organizational form of the People's Banks in the Northeast region and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region?

A: After the currency system is unified, the original Head Office of the Northeast Bank will be reorganized into the Northeast Regional Branch of the People's Bank of China, and its subordinate branches will be reorganized into provincial and municipal branches of the People's Bank of China, and sub-branches will be reorganized into county and city sub-branches of the People's Bank of China; the Head Office of the Inner Mongolia People's Bank will be reorganized into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Branch of the People's Bank of China (under the direct leadership of the Head Office of the People's Bank of China). There are currently 192 branches and sub-branches of the People's Bank of China in the Northeast region, and 17 branches and sub-branches of the People's Bank of China in Inner Mongolia.

Q: If I want to buy goods in the Northeast or need cash in the Northeast, can I remit money from the interior to the exterior through the People's Bank? Which places have remittance services?

A: Yes, you can. Since April 1st, the following eleven places in the Northeast can directly and unlimitedly remit money: Shenyang, Jinzhou, Andong, Yingkou, Dalian, Changchun, Jilin, Harbin, Mudanjiang, Chengde, and Qiqihar; the following eighteen places in the interior: Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Baoding, Kaifeng, Jinan, Yantai, Qingdao, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Xi'an, Shanghai, Hankou, Changsha, Hengyang, Nanchang, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. In addition, many other places can be remitted through the Shanhaiguan Joint Office.

Q: If I am traveling from the exterior to the interior and have Northeast circulating notes or Inner Mongolia circulating notes, what should I do?

A: You should exchange them for Renminbi in the Northeast region or the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Otherwise, if you bring them to the interior, they are neither allowed to circulate nor can they be exchanged.

Q: After the currency system is unified, can Northeast circulating notes and Inner Mongolia circulating notes be exchanged in various places in the interior?

A: No, you cannot. The main reason why they cannot be exchanged is the same as why Northeast circulating notes and Inner Mongolia circulating notes could not circulate in various places in the interior in the past. This time, the currency unification is for the Renminbi to circulate in the exterior, while local circulating notes in the Northeast are not allowed to enter the interior. If exchange is allowed in the interior, Northeast circulating notes and Inner Mongolia circulating notes will flow into the interior, which will affect the currency circulation in the interior. At the same time, limiting the exchange to the exterior facilitates the unified control of the exchange work. In the past, a small number of lawless elements engaged in speculation in currency in some important places of travel, profiting from it. Although the currency system has been unified, Northeast and Inner Mongolia local circulating notes are still allowed to circulate temporarily in their respective regions in April. In order to stop speculation, the measure of not allowing exchange is also in line with the interests of the people.

Q: In the past, there was a joint office of the People's Bank of China Northeast Bank in Shanhaiguan. Does it still exist now? Can Northeast circulating notes be exchanged there?

A: Yes, it does. However, according to the regulations of the unified currency system, it will be cancelled in the future. It is currently scheduled to continue to exist until the end of April. During this period, passengers traveling by train who hold small amounts of Northeast or Inner Mongolia circulating notes can exchange them there.

Q: What impact does the unification of the currency system between the interior and the exterior have on the allocation and settlement of units in the two regions?

A: Before the currency system was unified, it was difficult to carry out direct allocation and settlement because (1) the specific practices of currency management were not completely the same in the banks of the two regions, (2) the currencies used for accounting and payment by the units in the two regions were different, and (3) remittances between the interior and the exterior mostly had to be remitted through the Shanhaiguan Joint Office, which was not very convenient. Therefore, before the currency system was unified, only a part of the transactions between units in the interior and the exterior were handled through the bank's public funds remittance. Now that the currency system is unified, the Head Office of the People's Bank of China and the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government are discussing an agreement on the allocation of materials between the interior and the exterior and the settlement through bank transfers; the trade departments will start first to form direct settlements between units in the interior and the exterior, and other units will also handle them one after another. In this way, the allocation and settlement work between the interior and the exterior will also be fully unified.

　　中国人民银行回答关于统一币制的问题
    编者按：为适应国家经济建设的需要，便利全国物资交流，中央人民政府政务院特发布命令，决定统一币制，收回东北银行和内蒙古人民银行所发行的地方流通券。自政务院四月一日正式公布命令后，中国人民银行总行曾陆续接到一些询问，现经该行综合答复如下：
    问：中央人民政府成立后，许多地方币都陆续统一了，为什么东北区货币统一较迟？
    答：东北区货币统一较迟的主要原因，是根据当时的必要。由于东北全区解放较早，生产基础较好，物价已首先稳定；而此时关内解放战争尚未完全结束，稳定物价尚待努力，为了使东北地区不受关内的战争及物价不稳的影响，使能及早恢复生产，进行建设，以便运用东北已有的基础在财政经济上更好地支援全国，所以虽然其他许多地方币都陆续统一了，中央人民政府却决定暂时保持东北原来的币制。事实证明，当时这一措施是完全正确的和必要的。
    问：人民币和东北流通券及内蒙古流通券的币值比价，规定为一元比九元五角是根据什么计算和订定的？
    答：人民币和东北流通券及内蒙古流通券的币值比价，规定为一元比九元五角，主要是根据关内外交流的主要物资，就具有代表性地点的东北沈阳及华北天津两地的市场理论比值，结合双方贸易状况加权计算，并参酌山海关人民银行东北银行联合办事处对双方货币的兑换情况而订定的。并根据以下一些原则：（１）比价订定后，不使任何一方一般物价遭受波动。（２）照顾双方物资交流上不同的更多需要。（３）便利今后双方生产建设事业上的相互辅助发展。
    问：统一币制后，东北区、内蒙古自治区的人民银行是怎样的一种组织形式？
    答：统一币制后，原东北银行总行改组为中国人民银行东北区行，其下各分行均改组为中国人民银行省、市分行，支行均改组为中国人民银行县、市支行；内蒙古人民银行总行改组为中国人民银行内蒙古自治区分行（受中国人民银行总行直接领导）。东北区现有人民银行分、支机构一百九十二个，内蒙古有人民银行分、支机构十七个。
    问：如去东北买货，或在东北有现金需要，关内到关外可以经由人民银行汇款吗？有那些地方通汇？
    答：可以汇。自四月一日起关内外可以直接无限通汇的地点，东北有沈阳、锦州、安东、营口、大连、长春、吉林、哈尔滨、牡丹江、承德、齐齐哈尔等十一处；关内有北京、天津、唐山、保定、开封、济南、烟台、青岛、太原、张家口、西安、上海、汉口、长沙、衡阳、南昌、广州、重庆等十八处。此外还有许多地方，可经过山海关联合办事处转汇。
    问：从关外到关内，身边存有东北流通券或内蒙古流通券的应该怎样处理？
    答：应该在东北区或内蒙古自治区即兑换成人民币。不然带到关内，是既不准许流通亦不能兑换的。
    问：统一币制后，关内各地是否可以兑换东北流通券内蒙古流通券？
    答：不可以。不能兑换的主要原因，和以往东北流通券、内蒙古流通券不能在关内各地流通的道理是一样的。这次统一币制是人民币到关外流通，而东北地方流通券则不准进关内流通，如关内准予兑换的话，则东北流通券和内蒙古流通券将要流入关内，这将会影响关内的货币流通。同时只限于关外兑换，便于统一掌握兑换工作的进行。过去有少数不法分子，在一些来往冲要地方，作捣卖票币的勾当，从中渔利，现在币制虽已统一，但四月份仍准许东北和内蒙古地方流通券在各该区暂时流通，为了制止投机，采取不予兑换的措施，也是符合人民利益的。
    问：过去山海关曾有中国人民银行东北银行联合办事处的机构，现在还有吗？该地是否可以兑换东北流通券？
    答：有的。不过根据统一币制的规定，将来是要取消的。现在预定继续存在到四月底。在此期间内，乘坐火车的旅客所持有的小额东北或内蒙古流通券，可在该处兑换。
    问：关内外币制的统一，对两地单位的划拨清算有什么影响？
    答：币制没有统一以前由于（１）两地的银行，对货币管理的具体做法不完全一样，（２）两地的单位记帐和收付所用的货币不同，（３）关内外的汇款大多要经山海关联合办事处转汇，不甚方便，所以要开展相互直接的划拨清算是有困难的。因此币制未统一前，关内单位对关外交易往来中，只有一部分通过银行用公款汇兑的方式来办理。现在币制统一了，中国人民银行总行与中央人民政府贸易部正在商订关于关内外物资调拨，通过银行划拨清算的协议书；即将由贸易部门开始，先组成关内外单位间的直接结算，其他单位也将陆续办理。这样，关内外的划拨清算工作，也将全部走向统一。
