　　Welcoming "May Day", Popularizing and Deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement!
    The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China Makes a Decision
    Guaranteeing the Complete Implementation of the Specific Plan for the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
    [Report from this newspaper] After discussing the "Circular" issued by the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea on March 14th and the People's Daily editorial "It is Necessary to Ensure that Everyone in Every Place Throughout the Country Receives Patriotic Education on Resisting America and Aiding Korea," the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (hereinafter referred to as the Provincial Committee) believes that the call in this circular and editorial is an urgent political task that must be realized at present. Based on the actual situation in the province, the Provincial Committee has formulated a specific plan for welcoming the "May Day" International Labor Day demonstration and popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement (the full text of the plan can be found on page three of today's newspaper). In order to realize this plan, the following decisions are made:
    1. Party organizations at all levels and all party members and cadres must make the greatest efforts to ensure the complete realization of this plan of the Provincial Committee, and promptly formulate their own specific plans. It should be pointed out that our task is first and foremost to ensure that every cadre and every party member in the province can truly stand at the forefront of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in thought and action. At the same time, hundreds of thousands of workers and Communist Youth League members in the province should truly play a leading role in the great anti-American and patriotic movement.
    2. In-depth inspection is an important key to continuing to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. Party leading organs at all levels should recognize that although the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in the province has made great achievements in the past period, it is extremely unbalanced. In better areas, there is a tendency for the movement to lose momentum, so the achievements obtained are not solid; although many cities and towns have also held demonstrations and established patriotic pacts, there are tendencies of formalism; especially in many rural areas, the political atmosphere is still relatively thin; women, who account for half of the population, only a small portion have actively participated in the patriotic movement; the reform and patriotic movement in religious circles has only just begun, and in many places it has not even started; in many places in factories, production and politics are still divorced. If these situations are not first thoroughly inspected, it will be impossible to formulate specific plans and effective working methods that are in line with the different requirements of popularization and deepening. This is precisely the problem we must pay attention to solving.
    3. It is necessary to closely integrate the popularization and deepening of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement with the current production movement and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries; and to make the patriotic education of Resisting America and Aiding Korea truly become the driving force for promoting the production movement and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Some party members and cadres, and even some leading comrades, list the above three tasks in parallel, viewing them in isolation from each other, and even neglecting the popularization and deepening of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement under the pretext of being afraid of delaying production or delaying work. This is extremely wrong and should be resolutely overcome. The experiences of Taiyuan, Yuci, Pingding, and Guoxian prove that the above three can and must be combined. It also fully proves that the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement is the basic driving force for promoting all work. Whoever neglects this work even slightly will commit a major principled error in politics. Of course, holding too many mass gatherings, which affects the masses' production, should be avoided as much as possible. This requires all party comrades and the broad masses of people to work together to create better experiences in combining the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement with the production movement.
    4. Popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement is an extremely great and arduous task, which cannot be done well by a small number of party members. Party organizations at all levels must unite the forces of all aspects such as people's representatives from all walks of life, people's organizations, and democratic parties to carry out this work together; they must pay close attention to establishing and strengthening the organizations and work of the people's committees to Resist America and Aid Korea in various places, and vigorously give play to the role of all cultural, educational, and propaganda institutions. Anti-American and patriotic political education is a long-term task. In this movement, it is necessary to earnestly develop and establish party reporters and propagandists, and realize the Provincial Committee's plan to establish a propaganda network, in order to lay the foundation for further deepening patriotic education in the future, and to truly make this educational work regular.
    We must use strengthened practical work in Resisting America and Aiding Korea, and unparalleled determination to oppose the arming of Japan and defend world peace, to welcome the great "May Day" Labor Day! Our 11 million people in the province must unite as one and bravely stand in the great ranks of the people of China and the world to defend peace!

### 迎接“五一”，普及深入抗美援朝运动！  中共山西省委作出决定  保证全部实现抗美援朝运动具体计划

　　迎接“五一”，普及深入抗美援朝运动！       
    中共山西省委作出决定        
    保证全部实现抗美援朝运动具体计划
    【本报讯】中国共产党山西省委员会（以下文中简称省委）讨论了中国人民抗美援朝总会在三月十四日发出的通告和人民日报社论“必须使全国每一处每一人都受到抗美援朝的爱国教育”之后，认为这个通告和社论中的号召是当前必须实现的迫切的政治任务；并根据全省实际情况，制订了迎接“五一”国际劳动节的大示威，普及深入抗美援朝运动的具体计划（计划全文见本报今日第三版）。为实现这个计划，作出如下决定：
    一、各级党的组织及所有党员干部，务须以最大的努力，保证省委这一计划的全部实现。并迅速拟定自己的具体计划。应当指出，我们的任务，首先在于使全省每个干部、每个党员，真正能在思想上、行动上，站在抗美援朝运动的最前列。同时使全省数十万工人和青年团员，在反美爱国的伟大运动中，真正发挥带头作用。
    二、深入检查，是继续普及深入抗美援朝运动的重要关键。各级党的领导机关应当认识，过去一个时期，全省抗美援朝运动虽然有很大成绩，但极不平衡。比较好的地方，已有冷热病的倾向，因而得到的成绩并不巩固；不少城镇虽然也进行过示威，订立爱国公约等，但形式主义的偏向是存在的；特别是许多农村中，政治空气还是比较稀薄的；占人口半数的妇女，已经积极参加爱国运动的还只占小部分；宗教界的革新爱国运动仅仅是开始，甚至不少地方尚未开始；工厂里许多地方，生产与政治还是脱节的。对于这些情况如果不首先进行深入检查，就不能按照普及与深入的不同要求，定出切合实际的具体计划和有效的工作方法。而这正是我们必须注意解决的问题。
    三、必须使普及深入抗美援朝运动，与当前的生产运动与镇压反革命工作密切相结合；并使抗美援朝的爱国教育确实成为推进生产运动与镇压反革命工作的动力。某些党员干部甚至某些领导同志，把上述三件工作并列起来，各自孤立起来看，甚至借口怕耽误生产、耽误工作，而忽视抗美援朝运动的普及深入工作，这是十分错误的，应当坚决克服。太原市、榆次、平定、崞县等地的经验证明，上述三者是必须而且可以结合的。也完全证明抗美援朝运动是推动一切工作前进的基本动力。谁要稍稍忽视这个工作，谁就要在政治上犯原则性的重大错误。当然，举行过多的群众集会，因而影响群众的生产，是应当尽可能避免的。这就需要全党同志与广大人民群众在一道，共同创造抗美援朝运动与生产运动相结合的更好的经验。
    四、普及深入抗美援朝运动，是一件极其伟大而艰巨的工作，决非少数党员所能作好的。各级党的组织，务必联合各界人民代表、各人民团体、各民主党派等各方面的力量共同来进行；要十分注意建立与加强各地人民抗美援朝会的组织与工作，并大力发挥所有文化、教育与宣传机构的作用。反美爱国的政治教育是一个长期的任务。必须在这次运动中，认真发展与建立党的报告员、宣传员，实现省委关于建立宣传网的计划，以奠定今后进一步深入爱国主义教育的基础，并使此项教育工作真正作到经常化。
    我们一定要以加强抗美援朝的实际工作，和反对武装日本、保卫世界和平的无比决心，来迎接伟大的“五一”劳动节！我们全省一千一百万人民，一定要团结一心，勇敢地站到全中国全世界人民保卫和平的伟大行列里来！
