Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 14th: Czechoslovakia is widely introducing New China through periodicals, window displays, and sales of Chinese publications. The latest issue of the Czechoslovak Army's official publication, the "Our Army" weekly, devoted considerable space to introducing New China. The cover of the magazine featured a photograph of two Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers holding the PLA flag, with the caption: "Glory to the heroic army of the Chinese people, which stands shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet army as the most powerful defender of peace." The first few pages of the weekly featured photographs of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and the commanders of the various field armies of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, along with the Chinese national anthem and flag. The weekly published many photographs documenting the history and life of the People's Liberation Army and published an essay recounting the history of the PLA's founding. An author named An Jie, in an essay entitled "Defending Peace in the Far East," introduced the heroic achievements of the People's Liberation Army and pointed out: "Today, there is a force in the Far East capable of completely shattering the American imperialists' plans for aggression." The weekly also published a Czech translation of the short story "Six O'Clock in the Morning" by Chinese writer Liu Baiyu, as well as an article introducing the martyr Wang Xiaohe, a Shanghai trade union leader murdered by the Kuomintang reactionaries: "Wang Xiaohe – The Chinese People's Fucik."

The widely circulated "World Pictorial" printed a Chinese New Year picture on the back cover of its latest issue, with a note saying: "These exquisite New Year pictures express the spirit of a powerful nation fighting for peace, progress, and happiness for all the people of the world." In the window of the "Red Rights Newspaper" building in the center of Prague, Chinese New Year pictures were displayed, attracting a large number of viewers. Many large bookstores throughout the country, such as the Orbis Bookstore and the Freedom Bookstore, sell pamphlets from the Chinese Foreign Languages Press and the English version of "People's China," as well as some Chinese pictorials, which are warmly welcomed by the Czech people.
