To the Editorial Department:

　　Recently, I heard that the People's Insurance Company of China is going to start cotton insurance business in the Dezhou area of Shandong. Some people say that this is a good thing for the government to take care of farmers and help them grow cotton well; but some individuals think that this is the government pre-collecting cotton taxes. Because we are not very clear about this matter, we are writing to ask you to explain this matter in detail.

Comrade Xu Bingjun: Your questions are now answered separately as follows:

　　(1) The purpose of launching cotton harvest insurance is to protect the production interests of cotton farmers, reduce disaster losses, improve the quality and yield of cotton production, and expand the area of cotton fields. This is a way to help cotton farmers pool their own economic strength to jointly protect their production interests, and it is by no means a pre-collection of cotton taxes.

　　(2) The guarantee of cotton harvest insurance for cotton farmers is: once the planted cotton is insured, if it encounters natural disasters such as floods, droughts, insects, diseases, wind, hail, frost, and freezing, and the harvest is reduced, the People's Insurance Company of China will pay compensation in accordance with the regulations, so that cotton farmers will not suffer losses due to poor cotton harvests or no harvests. For example, in the Dezhou area last year, more than 190,000 mu of cotton fields suffered severe insect pests (red spiders) and hail disasters, and more than 10,000 mu of abandoned cotton fields. Therefore, local cotton farmers are very afraid of natural disasters this year. Launching cotton harvest insurance can help farmers eliminate this concern and allow them to plant cotton with confidence.

　　(3) Cotton harvest insurance not only provides passive compensation to disaster-stricken cotton farmers, but more importantly, actively combines with relevant departments to carry out disaster prevention and relief work. One of the most important tasks of cotton insurance in the Dezhou area this year is to prevent and control insect pests. The insurance company plans to purchase 1,000 sprayers and some medicines with the insurance premiums collected to prevent and control pests.

　　(4) The specific methods of cotton harvest insurance stipulate that only high-quality cotton seeds are insured, and the compensation for cotton fields that are not cultivated and fertilized according to proper methods is limited. Through these methods, farmers can be encouraged to select high-quality varieties and pay attention to cultivation, improve cotton quality, and combine the above-mentioned compensation and disaster prevention methods to make farmers happy to grow cotton and bold to grow cotton, so as to achieve the goal of expanding the cotton field area.

　　(5) Cotton harvest insurance stipulates that the insured amount is 70% of the value of the seed cotton that should be harvested, and the insurance premium is 5% of the insured amount. For example, if the average cotton field produces 100 jin of seed cotton per mu, the insured amount per mu is 70 jin, and the insurance premium is 3.5 jin. In order to take care of the actual difficulties of individual farmers, the insurance premium can be paid on a deferred basis after obtaining a guarantee.

　　(6) Launching cotton harvest insurance in Dezhou is very beneficial to increasing cotton production. It is estimated that this year, in Wuqiao, Dongguang, Ningjin, Nanpi, Dexian, Shanghe, Linyi, Lingxian and other counties in the area, cotton fields covered by cotton harvest insurance can reach 700,000 mu, and other areas are also preparing to try to insure some cotton fields.

　　(7) The working steps of cotton harvest insurance are: first, through publicity, establish cotton insurance committees at all levels, and then farmers freely combine to form mass cotton insurance associations and collectively insure with the People's Insurance Company of China.

　　(8) Cotton harvest insurance is currently in the trial stage in different regions. In order to combine with the actual situation, the methods and promotion methods in various regions are somewhat different. The above are just the situations prepared for trial in the Dezhou area of Shandong Province for the time being. Based on the trial experience in various places, the head office of the People's Insurance Company of China is now drafting a unified national method.

### 关于棉花收获保险的问题

　　关于棉花收获保险的问题编辑同志：
    最近听说中国人民保险公司要到咱们山东德州一带开办棉花保险业务。有的人说，这是政府照顾农民帮助农民种好棉花的好事情；但也有个别的人认为这是政府在预收棉花税。因为我们不很清楚这件事情，所以写信来请你们把这件事情详细的解释一下。
            山东德州  徐炳钧徐炳钧同志：你所提的问题，现分别答复如下：
    （一）举办棉花收获保险的目的，是为了保障棉农的生产利益，减少灾害的损失，提高棉产的质量、产量和扩大棉田的面积。这是帮助棉农集合自身的经济力量来共同保障他们生产利益的一种方法，决不是什么预收棉花税。
    （二）棉花收获保险对棉农的保障是：种下的棉花一经保险，如果遇到水、旱、虫、病、风、雹、霜、冻等天然灾害，而减少收获时，由中国人民保险公司照章赔款，使棉农不致因棉花歉收或无收成而遭受损失。如德州地区去年有十九万亩以上的棉田受到很严重的虫害（红蜘蛛）和雹灾，废弃的棉田共有一万多亩。因此当地棉农在今年对自然灾害很恐惧。举办棉花收获保险，就可帮助农民解除这种顾虑，使他们放手植棉。
    （三）棉花收获保险业务，不仅对受灾棉农作消极的赔款，更重要的是积极地结合有关部门，进行防灾与救灾工作。德州地区今年棉花保险业务最重要的工作之一，就是防治虫害。保险公司准备以所收保险费购置一千架喷雾器和若干药品，防治害虫。
    （四）棉花收获保险的具体办法中，规定只承保优良的棉种，对不按正当方法进行耕种和施肥的棉田，其赔款是有一定限制的。通过这些办法，可以鼓励农民选种优良品种和注意耕作，提高棉花质量，再结合上述赔款与防灾办法，使农民乐于种棉、放胆种棉，达成扩大棉田面积的目的。
    （五）棉花收获保险，规定保险额为应收籽棉价值的七成，保险费为保险额的百分之五。如平均每亩棉田产一百斤籽棉，每亩的投保额即为七十斤，保险费为三斤半。为了照顾个别农民的实际困难，在取得保证后保险费可延期缴付。
    （六）在德州开办棉花收获保险业务，对于增产棉花是很有益处的。今年预计在该区内的吴桥、东光、宁津、南皮、德县、商河、临邑、陵县等县，承保棉花收获保险的棉田可达七十万亩，其他地区也准备试保一部分棉田。
    （七）棉花收获保险工作步骤，首先是经过宣传，成立各级组织的棉花保险委员会，然后由农民自由结合起来，通过群众性的棉花保险会，集体向中国人民保险公司投保。
    （八）棉花收获保险，目前还在分区试办阶段。为了结合实际情况，各个地区的办法和推行方式，多少有些差别。上述各项，只是山东德州区暂时准备试办的情形，根据各地试办经验，中国人民保险公司总公司现正拟订全国统一性的办法。
