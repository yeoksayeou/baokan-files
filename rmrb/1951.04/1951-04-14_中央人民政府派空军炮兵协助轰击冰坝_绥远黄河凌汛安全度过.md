The Central People's Government Sends Air Force Artillery to Assist in Bombing Ice Dams
Suiyuan Yellow River Ice Flood Safely Passed

With the direct assistance of the Central People's Government, the people of various areas along the Yellow River in Suiyuan Province overcame this year's severe Yellow River ice flood, ensuring the safety of the lives and property of nearly one million people.

This year, the Yellow River thawed first in Ningxia, upstream. At that time, the temperature in Suiyuan was very low, and the river was still completely frozen. When the upstream ice floes reached Suiyuan, they formed ice dams, blocking the floodwaters, impacting the dikes, and threatening the safety of the lives and property of nearly one million people along the Yellow River in Suiyuan. On March 23rd, an ice dam formed at Dutangkou, the border between Suiyuan and Ningxia, and the flood control dike was breached. Upon hearing the news, Deputy Director Zhang of the Huangyangzha Engineering Office immediately led artillery, cadres, and the masses to rush to the rescue, and as a result, the ice dam was blasted open. On the 24th, another ice dam formed at Xuechengqukou, and bombing was ineffective, with floodwaters approaching Huangyangzha from three sides. At this time, the Wula River also formed an ice dam, and the water level rose sharply, overflowing to Toudaoqiao, and four to five hundred households in Micang County were flooded. The Shanba Special District immediately mobilized more than 1,800 people from Micang and Linhe counties to rush to the rescue. All cadres of the Special District and the CCP Prefectural Committee also went out to lead the masses in rescue work and handle disaster relief matters. In the most urgent situation, cadres led the masses to temporarily bundle wooden rafts and float into the floodwaters, rescuing most of the disaster-stricken people and livestock. On the 26th, another ice dam formed at Ta'erwan in the Heji Canal, and artillery from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army rushed to the rescue. On the 25th, another ice dam formed in the Shagou area of Micang County, and the masses blasted the dam open with hand grenades. On the 28th, ice floes accumulated into a dam in the Xifujiagedu section of the river. At that time, artillery from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army blasted it open, and no disaster occurred.

Upon learning of this news, the Central People's Government immediately sent airplanes, artillery, and engineers to Suiyuan to assist in bombing the ice dams. On the morning of March 29th, the airplanes sent by the Central Government scouted the ice dam situation along the river in Suixi and Baotou, Sarlachi areas. On March 31st, the Central Artillery and Engineers also arrived, and were deployed in various dangerous work areas. At 4 p.m. on March 31st, another large ice dam formed at Dabusu Tai, and the water level rose by 1.6 meters. Flood control personnel and the masses rushed to the dike for rescue, and artillery was called in to bomb it. The following afternoon, the airplanes sent by the Central Government concentrated on bombing the ice dam, and in just over an hour, the entire ice dam was opened, and the water level dropped rapidly. On the same afternoon, three more ice dams formed west of the Dengkou Station, and artillery from a certain unit immediately bombarded them. At around 5 p.m., the airplanes came again to bomb them, and all three ice dams were opened. On April 2nd, two ice dams formed in the Shidagu and Tuheqi areas of Saxian County, and were all eliminated under the bombing of the Central Government's airplanes and artillery. On the 3rd, another ice dam formed near Erdaowan in Jungar Banner, and the situation was very urgent. Air Force personnel worked tirelessly and repeatedly bombed the ice dam open. At this time, the Yellow River west of Machi in Baotou had completely thawed, and artillery from a certain unit closely followed the ice floes, advancing along the river to be ready for rescue at any time. On the night of the 3rd, three breaches occurred southwest of Tuheqi. The deputy regimental commander of a certain artillery unit personally went to the river to assist in plugging the breaches. Commissioner Xing of the Saxian Special District and the Saxian County Magistrate immediately mobilized the masses to plug one breach. The floodwaters from the remaining two breaches were blocked by the Minsheng Canal dike and the Erdaohao ditch, and did not spread into a disaster. On the night of the 3rd, the water level near Dengkou rose sharply for a time, and Secretary Hao of the Baotou County Party Committee and County Magistrate Luo of Baotou County hurriedly led the masses to protect it, and the dangerous situation was quickly overcome. On the afternoon of the 4th, after airplanes scouted along the river, the Yellow River in this province had been completely opened. This battle against the ice flood has basically declared a victorious end.

The successful passage of this spring's ice flood in Suiyuan is inseparable from the earnest care of the Central People's Government and provincial leaders, as well as the heroic and arduous struggle of the cadres and the masses. The provincial government organized work groups for Suixi and Baotou, Sarlachi, to go to Suixi and Baotou, Sarlachi to handle relief and guide ice flood prevention work. In particular, after the Suiyuan Daily published the news that Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the Central People's Government personally presided over meetings late into the night to deploy plans to destroy the ice dams, and immediately sent airplanes and artillery to blast the ice dams, it greatly encouraged and moved the tens of thousands of people along the river. When the Central Government's airplanes and artillery worked tirelessly to bomb the ice dams, many of the masses were moved to tears. Some said, "The Kuomintang's airplanes were used to fight civil wars and bomb our people, but the Communist Party uses airplanes to bomb ice dams and eliminate harm for the people." Some said, "Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou are in charge of national affairs and care about the old folks in Suiyuan. If we don't step up flood prevention, we will be letting down Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou." In this way, the determination and confidence of the people to fight against the ice flood was greatly boosted. The farmers along the river stood guard day and night, and if there was a signal to assemble, they could gather two thousand people within two hours.

On April 5th, people from all walks of life and organizations in Baotou City held a meeting to bid farewell to the Central Air Force and Artillery. After such a major test, the people naturally expressed their boundless love for their people's leaders and the people's country. They wrote a letter of thanks to Chairman Mao with extremely affectionate words from the bottom of their hearts. They unanimously said in a firm tone: "With the leadership of our Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government, we are fully confident of overcoming all natural disasters, just as we are fully confident of overcoming the aggression of American imperialism!"

　　中央人民政府派空军炮兵协助轰击冰坝
    绥远黄河凌汛安全度过
    绥远省沿黄河各地人民，在中央人民政府的直接帮助下，战胜了今年严重的黄河凌汛，近百万人民的生命财产得到了安全的保障。
    今年的黄河是由上游宁夏境内开冻的。当时绥远气温很低，河身尚全部封冻着。上游冰块流至绥境后，便结成冰坝，阻挡洪流，冲击堤防，威胁着绥远黄河沿岸近百万人民生命财产的安全。三月二十三日，绥远、宁夏交界处的渡堂口结成冰坝，防洪堤竟被冲决。黄扬闸工程处张副处长闻讯，立即带领炮兵、干部、群众赶往抢救，结果将冰坝炸开。二十四日，薛成渠口又结成冰坝一道，轰炸无效，洪水三面迫近黄扬闸。乌拉河也于此时坐冰坝，水位骤涨，漫至头道桥，米仓县有四五百户被淹。陕坝专署当即紧急动员米仓、临河两县群众一千八百余人赶往抢救，专署及中共地委全体干部也纷纷出动，率领群众抢险，并办理救灾事宜。在最紧急的时候，干部带领群众临时捆成木筏，泛入洪流中，救出了大部分灾胞和牲畜。二十六日合济渠塔儿湾又结冰坝，解放军某部炮兵赶往抢险。二十五日，米仓县的沙沟地区又结成冰坝一道，群众用手榴弹将坝炸开。二十八日，西傅家圪堵河段冰块拥积成坝，当时由解放军某部炮兵用炮轰开，未成灾害。
    中央人民政府知道这个消息后，立刻派飞机、炮兵、工兵到绥远协助轰炸冰坝。三月二十九日上午，中央所派的飞机在绥西与包头、萨拉齐一带，沿河侦察冰坝情况，三月三十一日中央炮兵、工兵亦已到达。分别布置在各险工地带。三月三十一日下午四时，打布苏台又结了一道大冰坝，水位上涨一米六。防汛人员及群众急忙上堤抢险，并调炮兵轰击。翌日下午，中央所派飞机集中轰炸冰坝，仅一点多钟，即将冰坝全部打开，水位迅速降落。同日下午磴口车站以西又结冰坝三道，某部炮兵立即轰击，下午五时许，飞机又赶来轰炸，三道冰坝，全部打开。四月二日萨县十大股、土合气两地又坐冰坝两道，在中央飞机和炮兵轰击之下全部解消。三日准格尔旗二道河附近又结冰坝一道，情况十分紧急，空军人员不辞劳苦，更番将冰坝轰开。此时，包头麻池以西的黄河，已经全部开冻，某部炮兵紧随流凌，沿河前进，以便随时抢险。三日晚上土合气西南决口三处，某部炮兵副团长亲自上河协助堵口，萨县专署邢专员和萨县县长立即发动群众堵住一处，其余两处决口的溃水，被民生渠堤及二道濠挡住，没有扩大成灾。三日晚上磴口附近水势一度猛涨，包头县委郝书记及包头县罗县长急忙领导群众防护，险境迅速度过。四日下午经飞机沿河侦察，本省黄河已全部开通，这一场与凌灾的斗争，已经基本上胜利的宣告结束。
    绥远今年春季凌汛的胜利度过，是和中央人民政府、省级首长们的殷切关怀以及干部群众的英勇苦斗分不开的。省政府曾组织了绥西及包头、萨拉齐工作团分赴绥西及包头、萨拉齐办理救济及指导防凌工作。特别是当绥远日报刊载出了中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理亲自连夜主持开会，部署破灭冰坝计划，并立即派来了飞机、炮兵爆破冰坝的消息后，大大鼓舞了和感动了沿河两岸成千成万的人民群众。当中央飞机与炮兵不畏辛劳的出动轰击冰坝时，不少的群众感动的流下了眼泪。有的说：“国民党的飞机是用来打内战和轰炸我们人民的，共产党却是用飞机轰炸冰坝，替人民除害。”有的说：“毛主席、周总理担当国家大事，关心我们绥远的老百姓，我们要不加紧防汛，太对不起毛主席和周总理了。”这样，大大鼓舞起人民与冰凌斗争的决心和信心，沿河农民昼夜放哨，一有集合信号，二小时内能集合起两千人。
    四月五日包头市各界人民和机关团体，开会欢送中央空军和炮兵；经过了这样一场重大的考验，人民都非常自然的流露出对人民领袖和人民国家的无限热爱，他们以发自内心的极亲切的词句，写出了向毛主席的致谢电。他们一致以坚定的口吻说：“有我们的毛主席、共产党和人民政府的领导，我们完全有把握战胜一切天然的灾祸，就如同我们完全有把握战胜美帝国主义的侵略行为一样！”
