Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: The Executive Committee Meeting of the International Union of Students (IUS) opened in Beijing at 10:00 AM today. The meeting was presided over by IUS President Gromman. Those present at the meeting included: Yershova (Soviet Union), representative of IUS Vice President Shelepin; Yang Cheng (China); Cruz (United Kingdom), representative of Jenkins; Quevara (Cuba); Secretary General Bellinger (Italy); secretaries or their representatives, executive committee members and their representatives, totaling twenty people. Invited to attend were one representative from the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and thirty-one student representatives from nineteen countries, including China, Belgium, Bulgaria, Burma, Ceylon, Czechoslovakia, Finland, France, Lebanon, Malaya, Nigeria (West Africa), Scotland, Hungary, Vietnam, Korea, Mongolia, Japan, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The representatives from China invited to attend were Xie Bangding, Ke Zaiyu, Lu Cuichi, and Liang Geng.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression; Ma Xulun, Minister of Education of the Central People's Government; Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China; and Jiang Nanxiang, Deputy Secretary, attended the opening ceremony.

In his opening remarks, President Gromman expressed his gratitude to the Chinese students and the Chinese people for inviting the Executive Committee to meet in Beijing.

Guo Moruo delivered a congratulatory speech, extending his respect to the student representatives from various countries on behalf of the Chinese people. He said: The young students of the whole world, especially their leading organization—the International Union of Students, have made great contributions to the movement of the people of the whole world to strive for freedom and democracy. At a time when world peace is being seriously threatened and even partially destroyed, we, the Chinese people and students, are determined to join hands more closely with the peace-loving people and students of the world to fight together to defend world peace, to strive for freedom and democracy, and to promote cultural progress. Ma Xulun pointed out in his speech: The education of New China is implementing the policy of opening schools to workers and peasants, and a large number of working people and their children have poured into the schools. The schools of New China are carrying out an education that is consistent with theory and practice. The students of New China are working hard, enthusiastically and intensively for the construction of the motherland and fighting to defend world peace. Jiang Nanxiang delivered a congratulatory speech to the meeting on behalf of the New Democratic Youth League of China and the Chinese youth. He said: This meeting, discussing the student movement in colonies and dependent countries, reflects the urgent demands of the vast number of oppressed students. The experience of the Chinese student movement proves that the student movement plays a very important role in the national liberation movement in colonies and dependent countries. If students want to obtain democratic education and a bright future, they must first strive for national independence and break the chains of imperialist aggression. Xie Bangding said in his congratulatory speech: All Chinese students warmly welcome the opening of the meeting. The convening of this meeting in Beijing represents the strong unity and close friendship between Chinese students and democratic students all over the world, and will greatly encourage the struggling Chinese students.

The meeting then adopted three agenda items: 1. The student movement in colonies and dependent countries and the tasks of the International Union of Students; 2. Preparations for the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival; 3. Other matters.

Gromman presented a report on the first agenda item. After a detailed analysis of the current student life and struggle in colonies and dependent countries, he pointed out: The colonial system is the deadly enemy of education, culture, and science, and is the most fundamental cause of the suffering and poverty of all students in colonies and dependent countries. He said that the aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism, in order to step up preparations for war, is intensifying its aggression against the colonies and exploiting the people of the colonies. Therefore, students all over the world, especially students in colonies and dependent countries who are most severely oppressed by imperialism, must unite more closely to fight to smash the colonial system. Finally, he suggested that the International Union of Students should support the struggle of students in colonies and dependent countries for national independence and democratic education with greater efforts and in various ways, and called on students all over the world to support the resolutions of the World Peace Council, oppose the arming of Japan, and demand a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

The morning session ended here.

Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: The Executive Committee of the International Union of Students continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 26th. Yang Cheng, the Chinese representative and Vice President of the IUS, delivered a report entitled "The Patriotic Movement of Chinese Students Against American Imperialism." He pointed out: From the past, especially since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chinese students have realized from experience that American imperialism has always been the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people and students. Chinese students have launched a struggle against the US-Chiang reactionaries together with the people of the whole country, and in the past six months, they have more enthusiastically participated in the patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. He pointed out: At present, a major part of the patriotic movement of Chinese students against American imperialism is to oppose the American arming of Japan.

After Yang Cheng's speech, members of the Chinese Young Pioneers entered the venue in formation to pay their respects to the student representatives from various countries and present flowers. In their congratulatory message, the representatives of the Young Pioneers sincerely expressed their simple desire for a peaceful and happy life, as well as their hatred for the American imperialist aggressors. The venue repeatedly resounded with warm applause for them.

IUS President Gromman read out a congratulatory telegram from Nanjing students to the Executive Committee.

After the break, Thomas, the representative from Nigeria in West Africa, spoke, denouncing the British imperialists' oppression of the colonial people and their devastation of the students. Quevara, the Cuban representative, accused American imperialism of trying to colonize Cuba. Jilani, the Iranian representative, exposed the conspiracy of American and British imperialists to actively prepare for war and undermine peace, and called on the people and students of colonial and semi-colonial countries to unite and fight for freedom and independence. All representatives expressed their active support for the just struggle of the Chinese and Korean people. (Attached picture)

    郭沫若首先致贺词，他代表中国人民向各国学生代表致敬。他说：全世界的青年学生，特别是他们的领导机构——国际学生联合会，在全世界人民争取自由民主的运动中，是有着很大的贡献的。在世界和平已遭受着严重的威胁甚至局部破坏的时候，我们中国人民和学生决与世界爱和平的人民和学生更紧密地携起手来，共同为保卫世界和平，为争取自由民主，为促进文化进步而奋斗。马叙伦致词时指出：新中国的教育正执行着学校为工农开门的方针，大批劳动人民和他们的子弟已涌入学校。新中国的学校正在进行着理论与实践一致的教育。新中国的学生正在努力热情而紧张地为祖国的建设事业而学习，为保卫世界和平而斗争着。蒋南翔代表中国新民主主义青年团和中国青年向会议致贺。他说：这次会议，讨论殖民地、附属国学生运动问题，是反映了广大被压迫学生们的迫切要求。中国学生运动的经验证明：在殖民地、附属国的民族解放运动中，学生运动有着很重要的作用。学生们要获得民主的教育和美好的将来，必须首先争取民族的独立，打碎帝国主义的侵略锁链。谢邦定致贺词说：全中国学生热烈欢呼会议的开幕。这次会议在北京召开，表示着中国学生和全世界民主学生之间的坚强团结和亲密友谊，并将给斗争中的中国学生以很大的鼓舞。
