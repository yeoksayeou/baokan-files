　　The key to flood control
　　-- Introduction to the Huai River Middle Reaches Flood Storage Project

　　The flood storage project in the middle reaches of the Huai River is key to controlling the entire Huai River flood. This project is huge and complex. More than 100,000 laborers have now arrived at the construction site and are stepping up the construction of 85 kilometers of dikes in the flood storage area, while actively preparing to build diversion gates.

　　The Huai River was originally a fairly calm river on the Jianghuai Plain, where rice was abundant on both sides and people lived very well. Since the Yellow River breached its banks during the Southern Song Dynasty and took over the Huai River's waterway to the sea, the Huai River has become a river without a tail, flowing through Hongze Lake, passing through the Sanhe, and passing through the canal and Gaobao Lake into the Yangtze River. From that time on, the Huai River bed was silted up with yellow mud and sand. In addition, the Huai River has a particularly large number of tributaries in the middle and upper reaches, most of which converge in a spoke-like shape above and below Zhengyangguan, thus forming a phenomenon of upper congestion and lower blockage throughout the Huai River basin. In 1938, after the Kuomintang bandits broke open the Yellow River levee at Huayuankou, the floods of the Yellow River further damaged the drainage system of the Huai River's main and tributary rivers, and the floods in the Huai River basin have become more frequent every year since then. In 1950, 40 million mu of fertile land on both sides of the Huai River were flooded, and more than 13 million people were affected.

　　During the reign of feudal emperors and Kuomintang reactionaries, they also clamored to harness the Huai River, but most of them remained at the stage of planning to solve the problem of the Huai River's waterway to the sea. They were eager to find a way out for the Huai River flood, but did not have a positive way and determination to cure the Huai River. In the end, even this passive prevention and control plan was nothing more than an excuse for the reactionary rulers to plunder the people's wealth.

　　After liberation, the Central People's Government paid great attention to the people's water conservancy projects. According to the decision of the Central People's Government's Administrative Council on harnessing the Huai River, the principle of harnessing the Huai River is: "Both storage and drainage should be planned to achieve the goal of permanent cure." At present, the upstream valley reservoirs and the midstream flood storage projects made by the Huai River Harnessing Committee are carried out in accordance with this principle. Judging from the actual situation of the Huai River basin itself, according to the hydrological records of last year and previous years, the flood flow discharged from the Huai River through Honghekou is about 6,450 cubic meters per second. After converging with the Shi, Ying and other tributaries in the middle reaches at Zhengyangguan, the flood flow increases to more than 10,000 cubic meters per second, while the Huai River channel below Zhengyangguan can only discharge up to 6,000 to 6,500 cubic meters per second. Therefore, it is necessary to block and store a large amount of floodwater in the middle reaches of the Huai River. On the one hand, storing floodwater can reduce the threat of floodwater to the dikes below Zhengyangguan, and on the other hand, it can also benefit navigation and irrigation. This is the midstream flood storage project that is currently under construction.

　　The specific plan for the midstream flood storage project is to use the six large lakes of Chengxihu and Chengdonghu and the three depressions of Menghua Depression between Huoqiu and Yingshang counties on both sides of the Huai River to store floodwater, which is estimated to be able to block and store more than 7.2 billion cubic meters of floodwater.

　　According to this plan, two major projects must be carried out in the flood storage area, namely the levee project and the sluice gate project. A levee 85 kilometers long, separating the Huai River from the flood storage area, will be built from Linshuiji, south of Sanhejian in the west, to Nipotu, southwest of Zhengyangguan in the east, as well as the Shangge levee to prevent the water of Chengxihu from overflowing, and the Xiage levee to block Chengxihu and Jiangjiahu. The construction of this levee requires more than 10 million cubic meters of earthwork and more than 170,000 laborers, which is almost one-third of the total number of Huai River harnessing laborers in northern Anhui last winter.

　　The focus of the sluice gate project is to build a diversion gate as long as one Chinese mile on the main stream of the Huai River in the flood storage area. The northern part of the gate is the river entrance gate, and the southern part is the lake entrance gate. In addition, a part of the original Huai River will be blocked, and a fixed river channel 83 meters wide will be opened south of the river entrance gate, so that a limited amount of Huai River floodwater can flow slowly downstream through this river channel; if a large amount of floodwater flows eastward, and the three depressions of Menghua and the fixed river channel cannot store and discharge the water, the lake entrance gate can be opened to allow the floodwater to flow into Chengxihu. In addition, a river-blocking dam controlling Chengdonghu will be built at Nipotu, and a Wanmin gate will be built on the Xiage levee. In this way, after the Huai River flood recedes, the Wanmin gate and the river-blocking dam can be opened to release water into the Huai River, and the land in the lake that has been silted up by the flood can also be planted with autumn crops, and the amount of water in the Huai River can be appropriately adjusted to facilitate navigation. In this way, the water volume of the Huai River's main stream is regulated and controlled through the flood storage area, and with the dredging of the Sui, Fei and other tributaries, the flood peak in the middle reaches of the Huai River will not be too high, and the flow of Zhengyangguan can also meet the required requirements.

　　As far as the entire midstream flood storage project is concerned, the diversion gate is a huge and complex project, and it must be completed before the flood season of the Huai River arrives at the end of June. Therefore, the project task is very arduous. It is estimated that the main materials for the construction of the diversion gate alone, including cement, rubble, gravel, yellow sand, and steel gates, will require 250,000 tons. The number of vehicles, ships, and workers transporting these materials is countless. In order to complete this sluice gate project in a timely manner, there will be about 10 different types of skilled workers, about 1,000 technical cadres, and 30,000 laborers from all over the country working day and night on this construction site of several hundred mu. To facilitate the progress of this project, a small power plant will be opened near the construction site, and a 15-kilometer-long light railway will be laid to help with transportation.

　　The construction of such a large-scale project and the control of such a large flow of floodwater is unprecedented in the history of water conservancy in our country. Moreover, this project needs to be completed in such a short period of time, which would not be possible without the leadership of the Central People's Government and the joint support and efforts of the people of the whole country.

　　控制洪水的关键
    ——淮河中游蓄洪工程介绍
    淮河中游的蓄洪工程，是控制整个淮河洪水的关键。这一工程规模巨大而复杂。现在已经有十多万民工到达工地，正在加紧赶修八十五公里长的蓄洪区堤防，同时积极准备建筑分水闸。
    淮河本是江淮平原上一条相当平静的河流，两岸盛产稻米，人民生活非常富足。自南宋时黄河决口夺去淮河的入海水道以后，淮河从此就成了一条没有尾巴的河流，而改由洪泽湖流经三河穿过运河及高宝湖经长江入海了。淮河河床也从那时起被黄水泥沙淤淀，加上淮河中、上游支流特别多，大部分支流均成车辐形汇集在正阳关上下，因而形成整个淮河流域上壅下塞的现象。到了一九三八年，国民党匪帮扒开花园口黄河大堤以后，黄河的洪水更加破坏了淮河干河及其支河的排水系统，淮河流域的水灾也从此一年比一年多。一九五○年淮河两岸就有四千万亩良田被淹，一千三百多万人口受灾。
    在封建帝王和国民党反动派统治时代，他们也曾经喧嚷着要治淮，但是多半停留在计划解决淮河的入海水道问题上，他们急于给淮河洪水寻找一条出路，而没有一个根治淮河的积极办法和决心。最后，就连这一个消极的防治计划，也不过成为反动统治者向人民搜刮财富的借口而已。
    解放以后，中央人民政府十分注意人民的水利事业。根据中央人民政府政务院关于治理淮河的决定，治淮的方针是：“应蓄泄兼筹，以达根治之目的”。目前，治淮委员会所作的上游山谷水库和中游蓄洪工程，就是本着这个方针进行的。从淮河流域本身的实际情况看，根据去年及以前多次的水文记载，淮河经洪河口下泄的洪水流量约有六千四百五十秒公方，到正阳关与中游的史、颍等支河会合后，洪水流量增加到一万秒公方以上，而正阳关以下的淮河河槽最多仅能泄六千到六千五百秒公方。因此，在淮河中游拦蓄大量的洪水，十分必要。一方面，积蓄洪水可以减轻洪水对正阳关以下河堤的威胁，另方面又可有航行和灌溉的利益。这就是目前正在大举动工的中游蓄洪工程。
    中游蓄洪工程的具体计划，是利用霍邱、颍上等县间淮河两岸的城西湖、城东湖等六个大湖及濛河洼地等三个洼地来蓄洪，估计可拦蓄洪水七十二亿公方以上。
    根据这个计划，在蓄洪区须举办两项大工程，即堤防工程和水闸工程。在西自三河尖以南的临水集，东至正阳关西南的泥泊渡之间，修建一道全长八十五公里的隔开淮河与蓄洪区的堤防，和防止城西湖水外溢的上格堤，与阻隔城西湖与姜家湖之间的下格堤。修建这道堤防，共需一千多万土方和十七万多民工，几等于去年冬季皖北全部治淮民工数的三分之一。
    水闸工程的重点是在蓄洪区淮河干河上建造一座长达一华里的分水闸，该闸的北部为进河闸，南部为进湖闸。另将原有的淮河堵闭一部分，在进河闸南边开辟一道八十三公尺宽的固定河槽，使有限量的淮河洪水经此河槽缓慢下流；如遇大量洪水东下，濛河等三个洼地及固定河槽均蓄泄不了时，就可开放进湖闸，让洪水注入城西湖。此外，再在泥泊渡筑一道控制城东湖的拦河坝，在下格堤上修建一座万民闸。这样，遇淮河洪水下降后，可打开万民闸及拦河坝放水入淮河，经洪水淤过的湖内土地还可以种植秋季作物，并适当地调剂淮河的水量，以便利航行。这样，淮河干河水量经过蓄洪区的调节控制，加上濉、肥等支河已经疏浚，淮水在中游便不会形成过高的洪水峰，正阳关的流量亦可达到应有的要求了。
    就整个中游蓄洪工程来说，分水闸是一个规模巨大而复杂的工程，并且必须在六月底淮水汛期到来前完成，因而工程任务非常艰巨。据估计，建筑分水闸仅主要器材包括水泥、块石、碎石、黄沙、钢闸等即需二十五万吨。运输这些器材的车辆、船只及工人难以数计。为了能够及时突击完成这个水闸工程，将有来自各地的十种不同的技术工人，一千个左右的技术干部和三万民工，在这块几百亩见方的工地上，日夜不断地工作。为便于这个工程的进行，工地附近将开设一个小型发电厂，并铺设一条十五公里长的轻便铁道，以帮助运输。
    建筑这样规模巨大和控制这样大流量洪水的工程，在我国水利史上还是空前的。而且，这一工程需要在如此短促的时间内完成，没有中央人民政府的领导，和全国人民的共同支援和努力是不可能成功的。
