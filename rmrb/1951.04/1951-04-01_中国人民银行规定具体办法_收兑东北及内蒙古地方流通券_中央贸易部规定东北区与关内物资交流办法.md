　　【Report from this newspaper】In order to implement the State Council's "Order on Recalling Local Currency Issued by the Northeast Bank and the Inner Mongolia People's Bank," the Head Office of the People's Bank of China and the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government have formulated specific implementation measures and issued them for execution. In accordance with the order, the People's Bank has decided to recall Northeast currency with Renminbi starting from April 1. The collection and exchange will be carried out in two stages: The first stage is from April 1 to April 30, during which there will be unlimited collection and exchange, and Northeast currency will still be allowed to circulate in the Northeast market; The second stage is from May 1 to May 31, during which the circulation of Northeast currency in the market will be stopped, but unlimited exchange will still be allowed. The local currency of the Inner Mongolia People's Bank will also be collected and exchanged starting from April 1, and its use will be discontinued from June 1. Because the Inner Mongolia region is vast and transportation is inconvenient, the exchange period for the local currency of the Inner Mongolia People's Bank will be extended to the end of July. To take care of the people of Inner Mongolia, the People's Bank has specially printed a portion of Renminbi with Mongolian characters for circulation in the Inner Mongolia region. In terms of trade, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government stipulates that after the unification of the monetary system, the free exchange of materials between the Northeast region and the rest of China will not be restricted, except for grain, coal, and matches in the Northeast region, which will be temporarily managed as a transitional measure, and tobacco and alcohol, which are monopoly goods, will be uniformly allocated by monopoly organizations.

　　中国人民银行规定具体办法        
    收兑东北及内蒙古地方流通券       
    中央贸易部规定东北区与关内物资交流办法
    【本报讯】中国人民银行总行和中央人民政府贸易部为执行政务院“关于收回东北银行和内蒙古人民银行所发行的地方流通券的命令”，已分别拟定具体实施办法下达执行。人民银行遵照命令规定决定自四月一日起以人民币收回东北币。收兑分两个阶段进行：四月一日至三十日为第一阶段，一方面无限制收兑，一方面仍准许东北币在东北市场流通；五月一日至五月三十一日为第二阶段，停止东北币在市面流通，但仍无限制兑换。内蒙古人民银行地方流通券亦自四月一日起开始收兑，六月一日起停止使用。因为内蒙古地区辽阔，交通不便，内蒙古人民银行地方流通券的兑换期限将延至七月底。人民银行为照顾内蒙古人民，特印制了一部分有蒙古文字的人民币在内蒙古地区流通。在贸易方面，中央人民政府贸易部规定，在币制统一后，东北区与关内物资除东北区粮食、煤、火柴暂时采取管理的过渡办法，及烟酒为专卖物资由专卖机构统一调剂外，其他物资关内外均可自由交流，不受限制。
