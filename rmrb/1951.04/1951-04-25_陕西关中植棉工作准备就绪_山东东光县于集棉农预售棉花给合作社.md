The cotton planting preparation work in Guanzhong area of Shaanxi, one of the most famous cotton-producing areas in the country, has been completed. All cotton fields have been plowed twice, and some cotton fields have been plowed three times. Farmers in Jingyang, Sanyuan, Gaoling and other counties have turned more than 30% of the cotton fields with iron shovels to a depth of 1.2 feet, and harrowed and leveled them very carefully. Farmers in various places have also built small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, so that 100,000 mu of dryland cotton fields have been irrigated.

Due to the extensive publicity of the reasonable cotton-grain price ratio policy by governments at all levels, the cotton planting area in Guanzhong area has increased significantly this year. Farmers in many places have set aside fields to prepare for planting cotton. Many cotton farmers in the areas along the Jinghe and Weihe rivers are planning to change the land originally planned for growing melons and vegetables to cotton. The area planned for cotton planting by farmers in 400 natural villages in Jin Yu and Li Yang districts of Lintong County this year has expanded from the original 40% of the total cultivated land area to 53.2%.

In the process of preparing for cotton planting in the Guanzhong area, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Cooperative Bureau selectively loaned 20,000 dan of high-quality cotton seeds, 1,900 tons of chemical fertilizers, 2,300 tons of oil cake and black beans, and various agricultural tools and insecticides, relieving some of the difficulties faced by cotton farmers in planting cotton and greatly boosting their enthusiasm for planting cotton.

Farmers near Yuji in Dongguang County, Shandong Province, are actively preselling cotton to cooperatives. According to the statistics of the Yuji Supply and Marketing Cooperative, 488 cotton farmers in six nearby villages have signed pre-purchase contracts with the cooperative for 296,000 jin of seed cotton. The pre-purchase volume accounts for 55% of the total seed cotton production of these six villages. In addition to obtaining some fertilizer when preselling cotton, farmers can also exchange for currency or other goods according to their prior requirements when delivering cotton in the future. Seeing that planting cotton can not only obtain fertilizer in advance, but also guarantee a good price when selling cotton in the future, farmers' interest in planting cotton has greatly increased. Last year, the thirteen villages within the business scope of the Yuji Supply and Marketing Cooperative had 18,500 mu of cotton fields, which has increased to 23,400 mu this year. The cotton field area of ​​the thirteen villages has accounted for 90% of the total spring field area.

At first, farmers in the area did not dare to presell cotton to the cooperative because they did not understand what a pre-purchase contract was. The cooperative made detailed explanations to them in response to the farmers' concerns. At the same time, in order to set an example for the farmers, the cooperative first selected two cooperative member groups in Yuji Village of Cheng Zhuang Township and Xiaotun Village of Da Tun Township to try it out. After the typical groups signed the contract, they held a member representative meeting by township, and the representatives of the two groups respectively reported the process of signing the contract, and then the cooperative members of each village discussed it, raised questions, and the cooperative cadres made explanations. In this way, the farmers clearly understood the benefits of preselling cotton, and the cooperative timely supplied more than 470,000 jin of soybean cakes, and also displayed standard cotton samples in the cooperative, guaranteeing cotton farmers that the grades would be determined according to the standard cotton samples after autumn, and high-quality cotton would be given a better price. Cooperative members in each village came to sign pre-purchase contracts with the cooperative. These pre-purchase contracts have been discussed in detail by the cooperative members, so the content is very agreeable to the cooperative members. For example, the contract does not make rigid regulations on the delivery period, and farmers can continue to deliver all the cotton from the time the new cotton is on the market until the middle of February of the following year. In this way, farmers can exchange for the materials or currency stipulated in the contract from the cooperative at any time according to their needs. The pre-purchase contract also specifies the price and grade of cotton, as well as the cooperative's timely supply of materials, because these are the issues that farmers are most concerned about and worried about.

　　陕西关中植棉工作准备就绪
　  山东东光县于集棉农预售棉花给合作社
    全国著名棉产地之一——陕西关中地区的植棉准备工作已经就绪。所有棉田已普遍犁过两次，有些地方的棉田已犁了三次。泾阳、三原、高陵等县的农民已将百分之三十以上的棉田，用铁锨翻土一尺二寸深，并耙、耱得非常平整细致。各地农民还兴修了小型农田水利，使十万亩旱地棉田得到灌溉。
    由于各级人民政府广泛宣传了合理的棉粮比价政策，今年关中地区的植棉面积已有显著增加。很多地方的农民都留出田来准备种棉。沿泾河、渭河两岸地区的许多棉农，把原来计划种瓜菜的土地，都准备改种棉花。临潼县金雨、栎阳两个区四百个自然村的农民今年准备植棉的面积，已由原来的占全部耕地面积的百分之四十扩大到百分之五十三点二。
    在关中地区农民进行植棉准备工作的过程中，陕西省农林厅与合作局，曾在该区有重点地贷出优良棉籽两万市担，化学肥料一千九百吨，油渣、黑豆两千三百吨及农具、杀虫药械多种，解除了棉农在植棉中的若干困难，大大鼓舞了他们的植棉情绪。

    山东省东光县于集附近的农民纷纷预售棉花给合作社。据于集供销合作社的统计：附近六个村已有四百八十八户棉农跟合作社订立了二十九万六千斤籽棉的预购合同。预购量占这六个村籽棉总产量的百分之五十五。该地农民除在预售棉花时已取得了一部分肥料外，将来交棉时，还可以按照他们预先提出的要求，换取货币或其他物品。农民看到种植棉花既可预先取得肥料，将来出售棉花时又可以保证卖个好价钱，植棉兴趣因而大大提高。在于集供销合作社经营范围内的十三个村子去年共有棉田一万八千五百亩，今年已增加到两万三千四百亩。十三村的棉田面积已占全部春田面积的百分之九十。
    起初，该地农民因为不懂得什么叫预购合同，所以不敢把棉花预售给合作社。合作社便针对农民的顾虑，详细地向他们作了解释。同时为了给农民作个样子，合作社先在程庄乡的于集村和大屯乡的小屯村选择两个社员小组来试办。典型小组订出合同后，便以乡为单位举行社员代表会议，由这两个小组的代表分别报告签订合同的经过，然后由各村社员加以讨论，提出疑问，合作社干部再作解释。这样，农民便很清楚地了解了预售棉花的好处，加以合作社及时供应了四十七万多斤豆饼，又在社内陈列了标准棉样，向棉农保证秋后按标准棉样确定等级，优棉优价。各村社员便纷纷前来与合作社签订预购合同。这些预购合同是经过社员详细讨论的，因此内容很合社员心意。例如合同内对交棉期限不作硬性规定，农民可以在新棉上市后一直到下年度二月中旬这个期间内陆续交齐。这样，便使得农民可以按照自己的需要随时向合作社换取合同上规定的物资或货币。预购合同对于棉花的价格、等级，以及合作社及时供给物资等项也都规定得比较具体，因为这些是农民最关心和顾虑最大的。（新华社）
