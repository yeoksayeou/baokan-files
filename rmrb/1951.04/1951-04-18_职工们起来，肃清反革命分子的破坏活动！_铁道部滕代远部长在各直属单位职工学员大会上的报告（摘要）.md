Workers Arise, Eliminate the Sabotage Activities of Counter-Revolutionary Elements!
　　--Excerpts from the Report by Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan at the Workers and Cadres Conference of Directly Subordinate Units
    In order to organize workers to deeply study the Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, the Directly Subordinate Work Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union convened a conference on the 12th, attended by more than 5,000 people, including workers from directly subordinate units of the Ministry of Railways in Beijing, cadres and students from the Public Security Cadre School and the Health School, and faculty, staff, and students from the Beijing Railway Institute of Northern Jiaotong University. Minister Teng Daiyuan delivered a report. Excerpts from the report are as follows:

    The struggle between revolution and counter-revolution is acute and cruel. As long as imperialism and its running dogs in China exist, counter-revolutionary elements will try to sabotage the people's cause. Just looking at our railways: the loss of state property caused by the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements last year alone was very large.

    For example, in the case of the "Kuomintang Shanghai-Nanjing Area Qishuyan Factory Protection Brigade" cracked at the Qishuyan Factory, Zhou Laisheng, the leader of the military intelligence special task force, developed more than 30 spies in the factory, carried out large-scale sabotage, created rumors, and directed enemy aircraft to bomb targets, successively burning four train cars three times. Huang Peng, a special agent of the "Hunan-Guangxi Border Area Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" and the "Joint Service Department Military Transportation Takeover Team" uncovered by the Hengyang Railway Bureau, used the pretext of cleaning furnace ash to probe railway intelligence and develop reactionary organizations. The special agent Yi Yinsheng served as the chief of the Changsha pseudo-police section before liberation and killed more than 200 people, including Li Yun, the Minister of Organization of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Zhang Zhixin of Hengyang was a special agent of the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" who had consistently framed progressive elements before liberation and did not repent after liberation. He deliberately tried to switch the wrong track, attempting to cause a train crash, and often spread rumors and wrote reactionary slogans. Military intelligence special agent Fan Yuhe lurked in the power work area of Tianjin East Station, deliberately electrocuting workers Cao Shirong and others, and collected intelligence on the Soviet delegation and Chairman Mao's special train. Chen Dequan, a Central Statistics Bureau special agent in the Shanghai Zhabei Locomotive Depot, used his technical skills to sabotage locomotive steam valves and water pipes eight times in a row.

    Those counter-revolutionary elements who have not repented after liberation, continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, cling to evil, and are determined to be enemies of the people should be resolutely suppressed. Without suppressing these counter-revolutionary elements, our hard work in construction is not guaranteed, and our people's democratic dictatorship cannot be consolidated.

    During the recent study, the following ideas have emerged, which I think should be explained. Some comrades said: "I agree with suppressing counter-revolutionaries, but we are an enterprise department, and we are afraid that employee morale will fluctuate and affect production." The concern about "fearing shocks" is unnecessary. It depends on who is shocked? Who is panicking? Of course, counter-revolutionary elements will be shocked, and they must be shocked. What's wrong with making bad guys afraid to continue their activities!? Facts have proven that after Tianjin and Zhengzhou successively dealt with a group of counter-revolutionary elements, the broad masses of workers applauded and said: It was a pleasure to kill them, we should have done this long ago! At the same time, the production morale of the broad masses of workers has also increased due to the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. For example, after the counter-revolutionary element Wen Shaozeng from the Tianjin Railway Bureau's Steel Fittings Factory was arrested and sent to the People's Court, the factory's rolling mill immediately launched a movement to challenge the Ma Hengchang team. The daily output of both groups A and B has exceeded the original standard by 62%. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries has led to "righteousness rising and evil declining." Counter-revolutionary elements generally show panic and fear of being beheaded, so they surrender to the government and hand over their guns. For example, within four days after the arrest of special agents at the Changxindian Factory, 25 special agents registered for self-renewal and handed over their guns. What's wrong with that? Only by resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries can we do a good job in production.

    Some people think that suppressing counter-revolutionaries is only a matter for public security organs and has nothing to do with them. This idea is also incorrect. Counter-revolutionary elements are enemies of the broad masses of the people, and we are serving the people, for ourselves, and for our motherland. We cannot stand idly by. We should create a situation where "rats crossing the street are chased and beaten by everyone" for counter-revolutionary elements in order to eliminate them.

    Some people say: "We took over everything as is during liberation, and now we are dealing with it again. Is there a contradiction?" There is no contradiction. The policy of combining suppression and leniency has not changed. The previous takeover was to quickly restore production and stabilize work. Special agents do not actively produce, but actively sabotage production. Now that we have learned that he is a heinous counter-revolutionary element who is determined to be an enemy of the people, why not deal with him? Some people worry that suppressing counter-revolutionary elements will lead to mistakes? Will good people be wronged? The people's suppression of counter-revolutionaries relies on careful investigation and research and the help and supervision of the masses. With these two things, there will be no mistakes. The Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries have clear provisions on what crimes special agents should be guilty of and how they should be dealt with. Those who truly repent can be treated leniently.

    Some comrades believe that suppressing counter-revolutionaries will affect the unity of technical personnel. This statement is wrong. Suppressing counter-revolutionaries is an act of every Chinese people loving their motherland. Technical personnel also love their motherland and will sympathize with and actively participate in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. In the past, some comrades held the view of not asking about politics, but after they actually understand the crimes of counter-revolutionaries, they will actively participate. The people's technical cadres must participate in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. As for special agents disguised as and mixed in with technical personnel, we will not condone them just because they have technology. We should not divide them by whether they have technology or not, but by revolution and counter-revolution.

    The Ministry of Railways is an organ of the Central People's Government and the leading organ of the national railways. Protecting the leading organ is like protecting a person's brain. The same goes for all factories, sections, and stations. We will never allow a single counter-revolutionary element to exist. Those who have joined counter-revolutionary special agent organizations in the past and have not yet confessed and are still active should quickly and voluntarily register with the Public Security Bureau. The government has long issued a clear order that failure to register or refusal to register is an illegal act.

    All our workers must, with the responsible spirit of the masters of the country and with practical actions to love the motherland, report to the government all hidden counter-revolutionary elements. Our study of suppressing counter-revolutionaries must be combined with practical actions. As long as everyone rises up to carry out the struggle against spies and special agents, under the sight of ten eyes and the pointing of ten hands, those few hidden counter-revolutionary elements will be isolated and have nowhere to hide. Only by thoroughly eliminating the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements can we guarantee the smooth development of the construction of the people's railways.

　　职工们起来，肃清反革命分子的破坏活动！
    ——铁道部滕代远部长在各直属单位职工学员大会上的报告（摘要）
    中国铁路工会直属工作委员会为组织职工深入学习惩治反革命条例，曾于十二日召集铁道部在北京各直属单位职工及公安干部学校、卫生学校学员、北方交通大学北京铁道学院教职员工学员等五千余人，由滕代远部长作报告。报告摘要如下：
    革命与反革命的斗争是尖锐的、残酷的。世界上有帝国主义及其在中国的走狗存在一天，反革命分子就要想法破坏人民的事业。就从我们铁路上来看：去年一年内因反革命分子破坏而造成国家资财的损失是很大的。
    如戚墅堰工厂破获匪“国民党沪宁区戚墅堰护厂大队”案，以军统特务组长周来生为首在机厂发展特务达三十余人，大肆破坏，制造谣言，指示敌机轰炸目标，先后连续三次烧毁车箱四辆。衡阳局破获的匪“湘桂边区反共救国军”及“联合勤务部军运接管组”之特务分子黄鹏，以包清理炉灰为名，刺探铁路情报，发展反动组织。特务分子易寅生在解放前任长沙伪警务段长，曾杀我中共湖南省委组织部长李云等二百余人。衡阳张志新，是“中美合作所”特务，解放前一贯陷害进步分子，解放后仍不悔改，曾有意扳错道岔，企图造成撞车事故，并经常造谣，写反动标语。军统特务范玉和潜伏在天津东站电力工区，故意电伤工人曹世荣等三人，并搜集苏联代表团及毛主席专车情报等。上海闸口机务段中统特务陈德泉，利用技术连续八次破坏机车汽阀、水管。
    像这些在解放后不知悔改，继续进行反革命活动，怙恶不悛，坚决与人民为敌的反革命分子是应该坚决给以镇压的。不镇压这些反革命分子，我们辛勤地建设是没有保障的，我们的人民民主专政是不能巩固的。
    大家在最近的学习当中，曾发生了以下几种想法，我认为是应当加以说明的。有些同志说：“镇压反革命我赞成，但我们是企业部门，怕员工情绪波动，影响生产。”“害怕震动”的顾虑是不必要的。要看什么人震动？什么人恐慌？当然反革命分子会震动，而且一定要他们震动。使坏分子不敢再继续活动，这有什么不好呢！？事实证明，最近天津、郑州连续处治了一批反革命分子以后，广大职工拍手称快，他们说：杀得痛快，早就该这样办！同时广大职工的生产情绪也因镇压了反革命而提高了。例如天津局钢铁配件厂反革命分子闻绍曾被逮捕送人民法院以后，该厂轧钢部即开展了向马恒昌小组应战的运动。现甲、乙两组日产量均超过原订标准百分之六十二。镇压反革命使“正气抬头，邪气下降”，反革命分子普遍表现恐慌不安，害怕杀头，因而向政府自首，缴出手枪。如长辛店工厂逮捕特务分子后四天内，就有二十五个特务分子自新登记，并缴出手枪。这有什么坏处？只有坚决镇压反革命才能搞好生产。
    有人认为镇压反革命仅仅是公安机关的事，与自己无关，这种想法也是不对的。反革命分子与广大人民为敌，我们是为人民服务，为我们自己，为我们的祖国，不能袖手旁观。对反革命分子应造成“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的局面，才能肃清它。
    有的人说：“解放接收时原封不动包下来了，今天又来处理，是否有矛盾？”没有矛盾，镇压与宽大结合的政策并无变动。以前的包下来，是为了迅速恢复生产，安定工作。特务分子不积极生产，而积极破坏生产。今天既然已经了解他是坚决与人民为敌的罪大恶极的反革命分子，为什么还不处理？有的人顾虑到镇压反革命分子会不会有搞错的？是否会冤枉了好人？人民镇压反革命是靠周密的调查研究及群众的帮助与监督，有了这两条就不会搞错。惩治反革命条例中对特务作恶应得何罪，如何处治有明文规定，真正悔改者，可以从宽处理。
    有的同志认为镇压反革命会影响到团结技术人员，这种说法是错误的。镇压反革命是每个中国人民热爱祖国的行动，技术人员同样地热爱祖国，会同情和积极参加镇压反革命的，过去某些同志存在不问政治的观点，但当他实际了解反革命的罪恶之后，会积极参加的。人民的技术干部一定要参加镇压反革命的运动。至于伪装、混入技术人员中的特务分子，亦不因为他有技术就姑息他。不能以有技术与没技术做分界，而是应该以革命与反革命为分界。
    铁道部是中央人民政府机关，是全国铁路的领导机关，保护领导机关要像保护一个人的头脑一样，各厂、段、站也是一样，决不允许有一个反革命分子存在。一些过去曾经加入过反革命特务组织直至现在还没有坦白并继续活动者，应该迅速自动到公安局登记，政府早有明令规定，不登记或拒绝登记是违法行为。
    我们全体职工要以国家主人的负责精神，以爱护祖国的实际行动，向政府检举一切暗藏的反革命分子。我们学习镇压反革命要与实际行动结合起来。只要大家起来进行防奸细反特务的斗争，在十目所视，十手所指的情况下，那些少数暗藏的反革命分子就会孤立，无容身之地。只有彻底肃清反革命分子的破坏活动，才能保障人民铁道的建设事业顺利地向前发展。
