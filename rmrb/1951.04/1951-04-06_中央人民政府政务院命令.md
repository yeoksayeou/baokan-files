　　Order of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government

After a year of consolidation, local finances in cities across the country have largely overcome the phenomenon of indiscriminate collection and expenditure. However, most cities still find their local revenues insufficient to cover expenditures. In order to guarantee the expenses of certain local undertakings, various regions have constantly requested increases in new revenues or have requested subsidies from the central government. To this end, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government specially convened the first national financial work conference of twelve major cities to discuss this issue and made a "Decision on Further Consolidating Urban Local Finances" to balance financial revenue and expenditure. The Government Administration Council now approves this decision and hereby orders its promulgation, hoping that it will be followed and implemented.

This order.

Premier Zhou Enlai
March 31, 1951

　　中央人民政府政务院命令
    全国城市地方财政，经过一年来的整理，基本上克服了乱收乱支的现象，但大多数城市的地方收支仍感入不敷出。为了保证某些地方事业的开支，各地曾不断要求增加新的收入，或则请求中央补助。为此，中央人民政府财政部特召集第一次全国十二个大城市的财政工作会议加以讨论，并对平衡财政收支问题作出“关于进一步整理城市地方财政的决定”。本院现批准此项决定，特令公布，希即遵照执行。
    此令
      总理  周恩来
        一九五一年三月三十一日
