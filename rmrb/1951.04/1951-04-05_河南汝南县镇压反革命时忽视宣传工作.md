　　Henan Runan County Neglects Propaganda Work During Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries

To the Editor:

　　Recently, Runan County, Henan Province, executed a batch of counter-revolutionary criminals. Most of the masses were happy and said: "The government has corrected the 'boundless leniency' deviation and avenged the people!" However, there are still a few backward masses who are indifferent to the government's execution of counter-revolutionary criminals. This is because Runan County neglected propaganda and education work when suppressing counter-revolutionaries. On March 17th, when Runan County executed twenty special agents, only a few judgment notices were posted. These judgment notices were written very simply, only stating the background, class origin, and former positions held in the puppet regime of these counter-revolutionary criminals, as well as stating that they were executed according to Article X, Section X of the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries." This kind of judgment notice has little educational significance for the masses.

　　I suggest that local people's governments should clearly state the crimes of the counter-revolutionary criminals in the judgment notices when executing them, and post the judgment notices in large numbers; or print them into propaganda materials and distribute them widely to the local masses, so that the masses can understand the crimes of the counter-revolutionary elements and raise the masses' vigilance against counter-revolutionary activities.

　　Editor's Note: When executing counter-revolutionary criminals, the crimes of the counter-revolutionary elements should be fully publicized to the masses. This can not only expand the effect of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, but also has great educational significance for the masses. Comrade Ye Maosheng pointed out the shortcomings in the propaganda work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in Runan County, Henan Province, which is worthy of attention by all localities.

### 河南汝南县镇压反革命时忽视宣传工作

　　河南汝南县镇压反革命时忽视宣传工作编辑同志：
    河南省汝南县最近处决了一批反革命罪犯。大部分群众都高兴地说：“政府纠正了‘宽大无边’的偏向，给老百姓报仇出气了！”但是还有少数落后群众，对政府处决反革命罪犯漠不关心。这是因为汝南县在镇压反革命分子时忽视了宣传教育工作。三月十七日，汝南县处决二十名特务分子时，只张贴了很少几张判决书。这些判决书写得很简单，只说明了这些反革命罪犯的出身、成份、所任伪职以及根据《惩治反革命条例》第几条第几项，依法执行处决等语。这种判决书对群众的教育意义是不大的。
    我建议各地人民政府在处决反革命罪犯时，应该在判决书上详细写明他们的罪行，并将判决书多多张贴；或者印成宣传品广泛地发给当地群众，以便使群众了解反革命分子的罪行，提高群众对反革命活动的警惕。
                                 河南汝南县总工会  叶茂盛
    编者按：处决反革命罪犯时，应当把反革命分子的罪恶充分向群众宣传。这不但可以扩大镇压反革命工作的效果，并且对群众有极大的教育意义。叶茂盛同志指出河南省汝南县镇压反革命宣传工作中的缺点，值得各地注意。
