    Our Great Motherland
    Bridge No. 8 between Luoyang and Tongguan on the Longhai Railway is the highest bridge in the country. This bridge was destroyed by the Kuomintang during the Anti-Japanese War, leaving only five dilapidated bridge piers more than forty meters high. In the autumn of 1949, a certain unit of our Railway Corps, relying on the heroic efforts of climbing hero Yang Lian'di and others, the assistance of advanced Soviet technology, and the hard work of all comrades, repaired it in two months. This is one of the great miracles in the people's railway undertaking.

    我们伟大的祖国
    陇海铁路洛阳潼关间的第八号桥，是全国最高的桥梁。这座桥在抗日战争期间被国民党破坏，只余五座四十多米高的残破的桥墩。一九四九年秋，我铁道兵团某部，靠着登高英雄杨连第等的英勇努力，苏联先进技术的援助，以及全体同志的紧张工作，两个月就把它修复了。这是人民铁路事业中伟大的奇迹之一。
