　　Strive to Build an Independent and Autonomous New Customs Service
    ——Congratulating the Promulgation of the Provisional Customs Law of the People's Republic of China
    The Provisional Customs Law of the People’s Republic of China was promulgated by the State Administration Council of the Central People’s Government on April 18th and will be implemented nationwide from May 1st. This is a major achievement of historical significance in the economic and defense construction of the Chinese people after driving away imperialism.
    Customs is a country’s economic gateway. For any independent and autonomous country, the key to this gate is always held by the country itself. However, for the past hundred years, China's customs has been controlled by imperialists and has become a powerful tool for invading China. As a result of imperialist control of Chinese customs, they imported large quantities of goods into China, absorbed cheap raw materials from China, and strangled and hindered the development of China's national industry, thus making China an economically backward colonial country.
    The great victory of the Chinese People’s Revolution ended this humiliating history of Chinese customs and transformed the customs, which had been controlled by imperialists for a century, into a completely autonomous customs serving the Chinese people and benefiting the national economy and the people's livelihood. Comrade Liu Shaoqi once pointed out: "The customs policy and foreign trade policy of New China have become important tools for protecting the development of New China's industry." This means that the key to our country's gate is in our own pockets, not in the pockets of the imperialists as in the past. From now on, Chinese industry will not be subject to competition from cheap imperialist goods, and China's raw materials will first be supplied to the needs of its own industry. This removes one of the biggest obstacles that has prevented the development of Chinese industry for a century.
    After the imperialist forces were driven out of China and the management rights of the customs were recovered, the political obstacles to achieving independence and autonomy of Chinese customs have been eliminated. In 1950, the customs achieved a foreign trade surplus for the first time in seventy-three years, and basically eliminated the large-scale smuggling by imperialists, warlords, bureaucrats, and local bullies. However, it is still a very serious and urgent task to build a new customs system on the political basis of independence and autonomy. Because the old customs was handled in accordance with the unequal treaties and the orders of the foreign Inspector General of Customs, who was the agent of imperialism in customs affairs, while the independent and autonomous New China customs must strictly abide by the laws of its own country and can no longer continue to follow the established practices formulated by imperialism. After the Central People's Government has been established for a year and a half, with the rapid recovery and development of foreign trade in New China, the increasing burden of customs tasks, and the active sabotage of Chinese customs by imperialism through smuggling, New China's customs should quickly carry out its work on the track of independence and autonomy. It should effectively supervise the implementation of the Central People’s Government’s foreign trade control laws and decisions, be responsible for the actual supervision and control of the import and export of various goods and currencies, and effectively collect customs duties and resolutely fight against smuggling. In order to carry out the above-mentioned urgent and serious tasks, to enable the new customs to act on a new track, and to correctly and specifically reflect the principles, policies, and tasks prescribed by the Central People's Government for the new customs, there must be a new customs law. The interim regulations, measures, etc. related to customs business that were separately promulgated and implemented by the military control committees and people's governments at all levels in the early days of liberation are obviously no longer able to meet the needs of the work.
    The Provisional Customs Law of the People's Republic of China is formulated in response to the urgent needs of the current customs work, based on the economic and customs policies of New China, the experience of customs work over the past year, and the advanced experience of Soviet customs, and critically adopting some useful business experience of the old Chinese customs. The Customs Law clearly and systematically stipulates the organization, tasks, powers, and unified customs working methods of the new customs agency, and stipulates the responsibilities and obligations of public and private enterprises, institutions, social organizations, and individuals engaged in foreign trade and transportation business to the customs regulations, and the mutual relationship between the customs and them. The promulgation of this independent and autonomous customs law indicates that the national customs work will embark on a new and more orderly stage.
    What are the basic tasks of the independent and autonomous customs of the People's Republic of China? The Provisional Customs Law clearly answers this question.
    First of all, it is the supervision of foreign trade. The Customs Law stipulates that the new customs shall be responsible for the comprehensive (including sea, land, air, and post) and actual (not just based on documents, formalistic) supervision and control of goods and currencies entering and leaving the country to ensure the effective implementation of the foreign trade licensing system and the complete control of import and export foreign exchange by the national financial management authorities.
    Secondly, it is to collect customs duties in accordance with the tariff promulgated by the Central People’s Government. This not only has the significance of consolidating the balance of financial revenue and expenditure, enhancing national defense construction, and stabilizing financial prices, but more importantly, it plays a role in coordinating national foreign trade control and protecting the restoration and development of national industry.
    Third, it is to fight against smuggling. The Customs Law stipulates that all smuggling activities that evade trade control and are combined with political sabotage should be dealt with separately from general violations of regulations and tax evasion. In all smuggling cases, the goods shall be confiscated, or a fine shall be imposed, and in important cases, the smugglers shall be transferred to the judicial or public security organs for investigation and prosecution. This regulation has great political and economic significance for the Chinese customs. Because, for many years, imperialism has attacked China with both predatory open trade and piratical smuggling activities. Today, after we have driven away imperialism and stopped predatory open trade, we have also adopted a decisive policy of banning illegal smuggling activities, which is a heavy blow to imperialism. At present, the smuggling activities carried out by US imperialism with Hong Kong and Macau as bases are the main targets of the New China Customs in curbing smuggling.
    There is no doubt that every patriotic person should adopt an attitude of cherishing and helping the new customs that protects national industry and fights against imperialism. All private enterprises and institutions engaged in foreign trade and international transportation should strictly abide by the responsibilities and obligations stipulated in the Customs Law, submit to customs supervision, promptly declare and pay taxes, and assist the customs in reporting illegal smuggling and tax evasion elements. If we recall the various discriminations and oppressions suffered under the control of the old customs in the past, such as Chinese merchants having to write foreign languages and speak foreign languages in Chinese customs, and even having to go through foreign firms to declare and pay taxes, and endure multiple layers of extortion and exploitation, we should automatically and consciously cherish our own customs. And we should include cherishing the new customs as one of the contents of the patriotic convention.
    Similarly, all state-owned import and export trade agencies and their staff should play an exemplary role in cherishing the new customs. We must not try to avoid customs supervision from the point of view of being afraid of trouble, so as to avoid creating chaos in import and export work.
    Customs work is linked to many aspects of work. Customs should clarify responsibilities and cooperate with the administrative departments of the state in charge of transportation in the supervision of international navigation vessels, and with the border defense public security departments in the investigation of smuggling along the coast and borders. We must not overstep our authority, nor can we shirk our responsibilities.
    At the beginning of the establishment of the new customs, the senior party and government organs in various places should attach importance to the customs work, supervise and guide the customs organs in various places to correctly implement the various provisions of the Customs Law, so as to gradually get on the right track.
    After the promulgation of the Provisional Customs Law, customs workers across the country should conscientiously study the Customs Law and strictly carry out various tasks in accordance with the Customs Law. The old customs workers were deeply influenced by British and American imperialism in the past; since liberation, after political study and ideological transformation, they have generally made significant progress. In the future, we must continue to transform our ideology and style, establish and consolidate the idea of serving the people, and develop a clean and simple revolutionary work style. All customs workers must also be good at publicizing the Customs Law, so that the work of the New China Customs can move forward victoriously with the assistance and supervision of the masses.

### 为建设独立自主的新海关而奋斗——祝中华人民共和国暂行海关法的颁布

　　为建设独立自主的新海关而奋斗
    ——祝中华人民共和国暂行海关法的颁布
    中华人民共和国暂行海关法已于四月十八日由中央人民政府政务院公布，并决定自五月一日起在全国实施。这是中国人民赶走了帝国主义后在经济国防的建设上有历史意义的一个重大成就。
    海关是一个国家的经济大门。对于任何独立自主的国家来说，这个门上的钥匙总是由各该国家自己掌握的。但在过去一百年间，中国的海关却掌握在帝国主义手中，成为侵略中国的有力工具。由于帝国主义控制中国海关的结果，他们向中国大量输入商品，从中国吸收廉价原料，绞杀和阻碍我国民族工业的发展，因而使中国成为经济上落后的殖民地的国家。
    中国人民大革命的伟大胜利，结束了中国海关这种屈辱的历史，把百年来被帝国主义所把持的海关，变为为中国人民服务的、完全自主的、有利于国计民生的海关。刘少奇同志曾经指出：“新中国的海关政策与对外贸易政策已经成为保护新中国工业发展的重要工具。”这就是说，我国大门的钥匙已在我们自己的袋子里，而不是如过去一样在帝国主义的袋子里了。从今以后，中国工业就不致受到帝国主义的廉价商品的竞争，中国的原料将首先供给自己工业的需要。这就扫除了一百年来使中国工业不能发展的一个最大的障碍。
    帝国主义势力被赶出中国，海关的管理权已被收回之后，中国海关实现独立自主的政治障碍已经没有了。一九五○年的海关已出现了七十三年来第一次的对外贸易出超局面，而且基本上肃清了帝国主义、军阀、官僚、恶霸大规模走私的局面。但是，在独立自主的政治基础上，建设起新海关的制度，仍是很严重而急迫的任务。因为旧海关是按照不平等条约和帝国主义在海关方面的代理人——外籍总税务司的命令来办事的，而独立自主的中国新海关必须严格依照中国人民自己的国家的法律办事，不能再继续沿用帝国主义所制定的成规。在中央人民政府成立已一年半之后，在新中国对外贸易迅速恢复和发展，海关任务日益繁重，而帝国主义又用走私来对中国海关积极进行破坏的情形下，新中国海关应当迅速地在独立自主的轨道上进行自己的工作。它应当有效地监督中央人民政府对外贸易管制法令和决定的实施，应当负责对各种货物及货币的输入输出执行实际的监督管制，并且应当有效地征收关税，与走私进行坚决的斗争。为着执行上述迫切而严重的任务，使新海关在新的轨道上行动起来，正确地具体地体现中央人民政府对于新海关所规定的方针、政策和任务，必须有新的海关法。解放初期各地军事管制委员会及各级人民政府所分别公布实行的一些有关海关业务的暂行条例、办法等，很显然，现在都不能适应工作的需要了。
    中华人民共和国暂行海关法则是针对当前海关工作的迫切需要，根据新中国的经济政策和海关政策、一年多来的海关工作经验、和苏联海关先进的经验，并批判地采取了中国旧海关一些有用的业务经验而拟定的。海关法明确地系统地规定了新海关机构的组织、任务、职权和统一的海关工作方法，规定进行对外贸易和运输业务的公私企业机关、社会团体和私人对于海关规章的责任和义务以及海关和他们之间的相互关系。这部独立自主的海关法的公布，表示全国海关工作将走上一个新的更有条理的阶段。
    中华人民共和国独立自主的海关的基本任务是什么呢？暂行海关法很明确地回答了这个问题。
    首先就是对外贸易的监督问题。海关法规定新海关对进出国境的货物、货币应负责执行全面的（包括海、陆、空、邮的）实际的（不是只凭单据的、形式主义的）监管，以保证对外贸易许可制度的有效实施和进出口外汇全部由国家金融管理机关所掌握。
    其次，就是按照中央人民政府所公布的税则征收关税。这不仅有巩固财政收支平衡，增强国防建设和稳定金融物价力量的意义，更重要的作用是配合国家对外贸易管制，保护民族工业的恢复和发展。
    第三就是和走私作斗争。海关法规定所有逃避贸易管制以及与政治破坏相结合的走私行为，应与一般的违章漏税行为分别处理。对于走私案件一律没收货物，或并处以罚金，其重要者，并须将走私人移送司法或公安机关究办。这个规定，对于中国海关来说，有重大的政治经济的意义。因为，多少年来帝国主义是以掠夺性的公开贸易和海盗式的走私活动同时向中国进攻的。今天我们赶走了帝国主义停止了掠夺性的公开贸易之外，对于非法的走私活动，也采取了断然的取缔政策，对于帝国主义是一个沉重的打击。现在，美帝国主义以香港澳门为据点所进行的走私活动，正是新中国海关在制止走私方面的主要对象。
    毫无疑问，每个爱国的人民对于保护民族工业与帝国主义进行斗争的新海关应当采取一种爱护和帮助的态度。一切进行对外贸易和国际运输的私营企业机关应该严格遵守海关法所规定的责任和义务，服从海关监管，迅速报关纳税，并协助海关检举违法走私漏税的分子。如果回忆一下过去在旧海关控制下所受的种种歧视和压迫，如中国商人必须在中国海关写外国文，说外国话，以至于必须通过洋行才能报关纳税，忍受多层的勒索和剥削的状况，应当自动自觉地来爱护我们自己的海关。并应把爱护新海关作为爱国公约内容之一。
    同样，一切国营进出口贸易机关及其工作人员应在爱护新海关这一问题上起模范的作用。不能从怕麻烦的观点出发企图避开海关的监督，以免在进出口工作中造成混乱。
    海关工作是与多方面的工作相联的。海关应和国家管理交通运输的行政部门在国际航行船舶的监管工作上，和边防公安部门在沿海沿边的查私工作上，明确职责，分工合作。既不能越权管理，亦不能推卸责任。
    在新海关刚建立的时候，各地高级党政机关应重视海关工作，监督并指导各地海关机关正确执行海关法的各项规定，使之逐步走上正轨。
    全国海关工作人员在暂行海关法公布后，应该认真地学习海关法，严格地根据海关法进行各项工作。旧海关工作人员过去受英美帝国主义的影响较深；解放以来，经过政治学习和思想改造，一般已有显著的进步。今后仍须继续改造思想作风，树立和巩固为人民服务的思想，和廉洁的、朴素的革命工作作风。一切海关工作人员还须善于宣传海关法，使新中国海关工作能在群众的协助和监督之下，向前胜利迈进。
