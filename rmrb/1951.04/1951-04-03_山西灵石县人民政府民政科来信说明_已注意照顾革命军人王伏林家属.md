A Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

　　Letter from the Civil Affairs Section of the Lingshi County People's Government, Shanxi Province, Explaining That Attention Has Been Paid to Taking Care of the Family of Revolutionary Soldier Wang Fulin
    Comrade Editor:
    Wang Fulin's criticism of our county's failure to take care of his family, published in the "Reader's Letters" section of the People's Daily on January 31, has prompted us to make the following report and self-criticism.
    Wang Fulin's father, Wang Daoxian, is 55 years old, of poor peasant background, with a family of seven, 28 mu of mountain land, a courtyard, and an ox, making life relatively difficult. The government's preferential treatment for him is as follows: Lingshi County was liberated in August 1948. In January 1949, a "Military Family Honor" plaque was hung at Wang Fulin's home. At that time, the new district was in disarray, and there was no unified system for preferential treatment for families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. In the winter of the same year, Wang Daoxian saw that Yang Zhongxin, who had worked with Wang Fulin in Dongjialing Village, a neighboring village, had formal certification and was allocated one stone of relief millet by the district government. Wang Daoxian also went to the district to ask for relief grain. Wu Bingru, the district finance and grain assistant, did not allocate grain to him because he did not have formal certification and did not provide a detailed explanation, which led to an argument with Wang Daoxian. In December of the same year, during the land reform in the village, the cadres participating in the land reform gave him a detailed explanation regarding the grain allocation issue; Wang Daoxian also understood that it was not in accordance with the procedures for him to ask for grain without certification. In January 1950, after the land reform was completed, the administrative village proposed to take care of Wang Daoxian. At that time, Wang Daoxian took the initiative to say: "I didn't do much labor when I was young, but I've been able to exercise more in recent years. I'm only 54 years old this year and not too old. I have less than 30 mu of land and an ox. I can farm it myself and don't need a substitute farmer." At that time, Cao Ren, the head of the administrative village, commended Wang Daoxian at a mass meeting and on the blackboard newspaper, and Wang Daoxian was very happy.
    During the distribution of relief grain to families of revolutionary soldiers at the end of last year, his family was also given 90 jin of relief millet. To this end, Gu Fengjie, the head of our county's Civil Affairs Section, also went to Wang Daoxian's home to express his condolences. Wang Daoxian also believed that his son Wang Fulin's comments in the newspaper were not entirely accurate.
    Regarding Wang Daoxian's visit to the district to ask for grain, the finance and grain assistant Wu Bingru's failure to provide patient explanations to Wang Daoxian was wrong, and the Civil Affairs Section has made a profound self-criticism. We will pay further attention to the preferential treatment of military families in the future to avoid similar shortcomings.

### 山西灵石县人民政府民政科来信说明  已注意照顾革命军人王伏林家属

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　山西灵石县人民政府民政科来信说明        
    已注意照顾革命军人王伏林家属编辑同志：
    人民日报一月三十一日的“读者来信专页”内，发表了王伏林同志对本县不照顾其家属的批评。为此事我们特作以下的报告和检讨。
    王伏林之父王道显年五十五岁，系贫农成份，家有七口人，有山地二十八亩，院一所，牛一头，生活比较困难。政府对他的优待情况是这样：灵石县于一九四八年八月份解放，一九四九年一月份给王伏林之家挂了军属光荣牌。当时新区秩序混乱，对革命烈士家属，革命军人家属等的优待还没有统一的制度。同年冬季王道显看到邻村董家岭村与王伏林一同参加工作的杨忠信同志，持有正式证明文件，由区政府拨给救济小米一石。王道显也到区里要救济粮。区财粮助理员吴炳茹因其没有正式证明文件，没有给他拨粮，也没有作详细解释，并因此和王道显争吵了一次。同年十二月份该村土地改革时，参加土地改革的干部为拨粮问题曾对他作了详细的解释；王道显也了解到自己没有证明文件，前往要粮不合手续。一九五○年一月份土地改革结束后，行政村即对王道显提出要照顾，当时王道显主动地说：我年青时没有多劳动过，近几年来我锻炼的还可以了。今年我才五十四岁还不算老，我的土地不到三十亩，有牛一头，我自己能种，不需要代耕。当时由行政村长曹仁，在群众大会上和黑板报上对王道显作了表扬，王道显也很高兴。
    在去年年关发救济优待革命军人家属粮时，也发给他家救济粮小米九十斤。为此事我县民政科长顾丰节还到王道显家中慰问。王道显也认为其子王伏林在报上所提的意见不够正确。
    关于王道显到区上拨粮一事，财粮助理员吴炳茹对王道显不作耐心的解释，是不对的，民政科已作了深刻的检讨。我们今后对于优待军人家属一事当作进一步的注意，以求不再发生类似缺点。
