　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 18th: As the famine in India develops to its most critical point, the Chinese people are very concerned and sympathetic to the difficulties faced by the Indian people due to the famine. In order to enhance the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Indian people, our Central People's Government has recently agreed to supply India with another one million tons of grain.

　　All newspapers across India have hailed this proposal in unison, calling it a manifestation of the great friendship of the Chinese people towards the Indian people. The Indian News Chronicle wrote in its April 4th editorial: The Indian people "welcome the reported suggestion that China will supply India with one million tons of grain." The newspaper pointed out: "This suggestion is a very great expression of friendship towards a neighboring country like India. India is determined to maintain the most friendly relations with China. This rice will certainly have a spiritual nutritional value. Given that we will certainly have a long-term food shortage in the next few years, we can now enter into a long-term agreement with China." The Hindi "New India Times" published an editorial on April 4th entitled "A Neighbor Who Sympathizes With Us," contrasting the sincere help of the People's China to the Indian people with the long-proclaimed American "gift" of grain to India. The newspaper wrote: "China is not like those wealthy countries, neither saying it will donate grain to us, nor demanding that its officials supervise the distribution of grain." The "Leader Newspaper" published an editorial on April 6th entitled "Who is India's Real Friend." The newspaper wrote: The People's China, which has been slandered and vilified by the United States, "is today radiating humanitarian brilliance in all directions. China has overcome all difficulties to achieve self-sufficiency in food. Seeing the great suffering of India, the Chinese people have felt sympathy and proposed to supply the Indian people with one million tons of food." The newspaper concluded: "For the Indian people, now is the time for them to recognize enemies and friends, and treat them separately."

　　关怀印度人民因粮荒所遭受的困难
　  我国同意续以百万吨粮食输印
　  印度人民对于我国的真诚帮助热烈欢呼
    【新华社新德里十八日电】正当印度粮荒发展到最危急的时候，中国人民非常关怀和同情印度人民由于粮荒所遭受的困难。为了增进中印两国人民之间的友谊与合作，我国中央人民政府最近同意再供给印度一百万吨粮食。
    印度全国各报对这个建议都同声欢呼，称之为中国人民对印度人民的伟大友谊的表现。印度新闻纪事报四月四日的社论写道：印度人民“欢迎所传中国将供给印度一百万吨粮食的建议”。该报指出：“这个建议是对于印度这样的邻国的一种非常伟大的友谊的表示。印度是决意要与中国保持最友好的关系的。这种大米一定会具有一种精神上的营养价值。鉴于我们在今后若干年之内一定会有长期的粮食不足，我们现在就可以与中国径行订立长期协定。”印地语的“新印度时报”于四月四日发表题为“一个同情我们的邻国”的社论，将人民中国对印度人民的真诚帮助，与美国所宣扬已久的“赠送”粮食给印度的把戏作了对比。该报写道：“中国不像那些豪富的国家，既没有说要赠送我们粮食，也没有要求由他的官员来监督粮食的分配。”“领袖报”于四月六日的社论题为“谁是印度的真正的朋友”。该报写道：横遭美国诬蔑诽谤的人民中国，“今天正在向四面八方发出人道主义的光辉。中国曾排除万难在粮食问题上达到自给自足的地步。中国人民看到印度遭受巨大的苦难，发生了同情之心，并提议供给印度人民一百万吨食粮”。该报结语称：“对于印度人民来说，现在正是他们认清敌人和朋友、并分别地加以对待的时候了。
