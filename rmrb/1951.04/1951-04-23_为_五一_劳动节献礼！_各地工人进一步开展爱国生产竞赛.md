To Present a Gift for the "May Day" Labor Day!
Workers Across the Country Further Launch Patriotic Production Competitions

　　Workers across the country are launching an even more extensive patriotic production competition as a gift for the "May Day" Labor Day. In factories and mines, on railways and in forests, more than 2,800 factories, mines, and enterprises, and more than 2.2 million workers have already joined the production competition. Challenge letters from heroes are pouring in like snowflakes. More than 5,500 groups have already responded to the Ma Hengchang Advanced Production Team's challenge. The Shi Yuhai Model Safe Production Team's challenge has also been met with response from the majority of workers in the coal mining industry. Advanced producers such as the Andong Railway Bureau Telephone Station, the model workers of Shenyang City, the Shixian Paper Mill, and the Wang Yongxiang ironworking team of Hunan have all issued new challenges to their respective industries or regions. Workers in each locomotive group of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot are determined to dedicate one million kilometers of safe operation as a gift for the "May Day" Labor Day. In addition to guaranteeing the fulfillment of the conditions for responding to the Ma Hengchang Team's challenge and saving 50% of locomotive materials, the workers of the famous "Mao Zedong" locomotive group have also proposed conditions such as "increasing vigilance and strictly preventing sabotage by saboteurs." In addition, workers in Lushun and Dalian and other places have decided to promote advanced experience, and workers in the Zhangjiakou Railway Factory are offering rationalization proposals as "May Day" gifts. Workers in Changsha City guarantee that they will universally launch a campaign to learn from the experience of the Ma Hengchang Team in all industries with more than 50 people in the city, and cultivate eight advanced teams on the original basis. Workers in Fuzhou City are determined to strive to have another 30 units and more than 12,000 workers participate in the patriotic competition movement in the Red May.

　　In order to further deepen the patriotic competition movement and lay an ideological foundation for the "May Day" national demonstration parade, trade unions in various places have made plans to conduct in-depth patriotic ideological education among workers. After current affairs education, employees in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places have generally established patriotic pacts and turned them into the action guidelines of every employee. In order to ensure that every employee and family member receives patriotic education for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions has hired more than 100 reporters to conduct reports at the grassroots trade union level, organize discussions and accusations, and then establish patriotic pacts. Through these actions, the class consciousness of workers across the country will be greatly improved, and even more brilliant achievements will be created in the Red May competition.

　　为“五一”劳动节献礼！
    各地工人进一步开展爱国生产竞赛
    全国工人们正在以进一步的开展爱国主义的生产竞赛运动，来作为对“五一”劳动节的献礼，在工厂和矿山，在铁路和森林里，两千八百多个工厂、矿山和企业单位，二百二十多万工人群众刻已投入了生产竞赛运动。英雄们的挑战应战书雪片似的飞来，向马恒昌先进生产小组应战的小组刻已达五千五百多个，施玉海模范安全生产小组的挑战也获得了煤矿工业中广大工人们的响应。安东铁路局电话所、沈阳市的劳动模范们，石岘造纸厂，湖南王永祥铁工班等先进生产者，均已向各该产业或地区提出了新的挑战。丰台机务段各机车组工友决心以百万安全走行公里来作为对“五一”劳动节的献礼，著名的“毛泽东号”机车组的工友除保证实现向马恒昌小组应战的条件和节省机车用料百分之五十外，并提出要“提高警惕，严防破坏分子破坏”等条件。此外旅大等地工友决以推广先进经验，张家口铁路工厂工友以合理化建议等来当作“五一”献礼。长沙市工人们保证在全市五十人以上的产业内普遍展开学习马恒昌小组经验运动，并在原有基础上培养出八个先进小组来。福州市工人们决在红五月中争取再有三十个单位、一万二千多工人参加到爱国竞赛运动中来。
    为进一步深入爱国主义竞赛运动和为“五一”全国大示威游行打下思想基础，各地工会刻已作出计划，深入地在工人中进行爱国主义的思想教育。上海、天津等地职工经过时事教育后普遍订立了爱国公约，把爱国公约变成每个职工的行动纲领。为使每个职工和工属受到抗美援朝的爱国教育，沈阳市总工会已聘请一百多个报告员，以基层工会为单位进行报告，并组织讨论和控诉，进而订立爱国公约。经过这些行动，将使全国工人的阶级觉悟大大提高，并在红五月的竞赛中创造出更辉煌的成绩来。
