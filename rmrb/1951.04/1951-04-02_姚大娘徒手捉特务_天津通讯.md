　　Granny Yao Catches a Spy with Her Bare Hands
    ·Tianjin Correspondence·
    Fifty-one-year-old Granny Yao, who lives in Tianjin, caught the spy Yang Fazhang with her bare hands. Granny Yao lives in a large courtyard near the Tianjin West Railway Station, where more than a dozen families reside, including Hei Liansheng, who sells milk, Grandma Zhang Si, who runs a mill, Shi Jintong, who twists hemp ropes, and Yang Fazhang, a spy under surveillance.

    Granny Yao's family has six members. Her two sons work in a state-owned cigarette factory and do not often come home, leaving only the old couple, their elder daughter-in-law, and a young grandson. After the Municipal Public Security Bureau announced that Yang Fazhang had infiltrated our Revolutionary University to carry out espionage activities and was currently a person under surveillance, Granny Yao paid attention to understanding his situation and monitoring his actions.

    Granny Yao's house is directly opposite the Yangs' house. During the Spring Festival this year, she took her children to the Yangs' house to pay New Year's greetings, and they began to interact. Granny Yao often visited his house, teaching Yang Fazhang's mother how to twist hemp ropes, and sometimes chatted with Yang Fazhang. This went on for almost three months. At night, Granny Yao didn't even hang curtains; even with the lights off, she watched the activity in the Yangs' house by the light of their lamps.

    The key to the courtyard gate was managed by Shi Jintong. Granny Yao, fearing that Yang Fazhang would run around, told Jintong: "Brother Tong, you must be careful with the gate. Open and close it at regular times, and don't give the key to anyone at other times. If anyone disagrees, let me know." The back door was managed by Grandma Zhang Si, who ran the mill. She also told Grandma Zhang Si: "Don't easily lend your back door to others! You know that the young man from the Yangs is not honest."

    At around 2:00 AM on March 9th, Granny Yao saw a light in the Yangs' room. She woke up Grandpa Yao to take a walk in the courtyard. The opposite room heard voices and immediately turned off the lights. Until 5:00 AM, Granny Yao couldn't rest easy, so she woke up her daughter-in-law to listen to the activity in the opposite room. At around 6:00 AM, the old man from the Yangs asked for the key, and he opened the gate as soon as it was light. Granny Yao's daughter-in-law caught a glimpse of a person carrying a bedding roll walking out of the courtyard. At this moment, Hei Zhaoming, the thirteen-year-old child of Hei Liansheng, a student at the Municipal Twenty-Third Elementary School, yelled in the courtyard while pulling up his pants: "The spy is running away!" His mother immediately told him to ride his small pedal tricycle to report to the police station. Granny Yao also hurriedly dressed and chased after him. Granny Yao had bound feet, and she chased while shouting. Yang Fazhang was running around in a panic with his luggage on his shoulder, but at the West Railway Station, Granny Yao finally caught him. She handed him over to the police station, panting. Sweat streamed down her face. She felt like a stone had been lifted from her heart and said: "I caught the spy." When the reporter asked her why she was so brave, she said: "If I hadn't suffered so much from the oppression of spies and bullies in the past, how would I know how vicious they are?"

    It turned out that Granny Yao's family had suffered greatly from the persecution of Japanese invaders and the oppression of spies and bullies. Her eldest son was once captured by the Japanese invaders to work as a coolie, her second son pulled a dirt cart, and the old man pedaled a tricycle. The family's earnings were not enough to eat and drink, and they were also forced by bullies to sell their only quilt. After Tianjin was liberated, both sons got jobs and became active members of the production front. Now, her family lives in two rooms, wallpapered cleanly, and such a life is not easy to come by. In order to protect her own life and the safety of everyone, she voluntarily watched and captured the spy Yang Fazhang who was under surveillance.

### 姚大娘徒手捉特务  天津通讯

　　姚大娘徒手捉特务
    ·天津通讯·
    住在天津市的五十一岁的姚大娘，徒手捉住了特务分子杨法章。姚大娘住在靠近天津西站的一个大杂院里，同院住着十几户人家，有卖牛奶的黑连升，开磨房的张四奶奶，搓麻绳的史金桐和被管制的特务分子杨法章。
    姚大娘家有六口人。两个儿子在公营烟厂做工，不常回家，家里只剩下老夫妇俩、大儿媳和一个小孙子。当市公安局宣布杨法章曾混入我革命大学进行过特务活动，目前是个被管制分子后，姚大娘就注意了解他的情况和监视他的行动。
    姚大娘的住房，正和杨家对面。今年春节，她领着孩子到杨家去拜年，开始有了来往。姚大娘平时就常到他家串门，教给杨法章的娘搓麻绳，有时也和杨法章搭讪两句话。就这样差不多有三个月。夜里，姚大娘的窗帘也不挂，黑了灯，也在看杨家灯影的活动。
    院子大门上的钥匙是史金桐经管的，姚大娘怕杨法章乱跑，她告诉金桐说：“桐哥，你可小心门户呀，早晚开关要有定时，别的时候谁要钥匙，可千万别给；谁要不答应，可给我个话儿。”后门是磨房张四奶奶管的，她也给四奶奶说：“你家后门可别轻易给别人借光呀！你知道杨家的小子不老实。”
    三月九日夜里两点多钟，姚大娘看见杨家房里有灯光，她便叫醒姚老先生到院里去走走；对房听见有人声，马上把灯灭了。直到五点钟，姚大娘放心不下，叫醒了儿媳一同听着对房的动静。六点来钟，杨家老头要钥匙，天刚亮就开了大门。姚家媳妇一闪眼看见院里有一个人肩着铺盖往外走。这时，黑连升的十三岁的孩子、市立二十三小学的学生黑昭明，在院里提着裤子大叫：“特务跑了！”他妈马上叫他蹬上小脚踏车去派出所报告。姚大娘也就急忙穿好衣服追出去。姚大娘是缠过足的，她一面追一面喊。杨法章肩着行李慌慌张张地乱窜，但到西站，终于被姚大娘抓住了。她气喘喘地把他交给了派出所。她脸上的汗涔涔地直流。她的心里像掉下了一颗石子似地说：“特务被我抓到了。”当记者问她为什么这样的勇敢？她说：“要不是我过去受尽特务恶霸的欺压，我怎知道他们的狠毒。”
    原来，姚大娘一家从前受尽日寇的迫害和特务恶霸的欺压。大儿子曾被日寇抓去当苦工，二儿子拉土车，老头子蹬三轮，一家挣的不够吃喝，还被恶霸逼着买去一床仅有的被子。天津解放后，两个儿子都有了工作，都是生产战线上的积极分子。现在她家住着两间房，裱糊得干干净净，这样的生活是不容易得来的。她为了保障自己的生活和大伙儿的安全，才自动地看管和捕捉了被管制的特务分子杨法章。
