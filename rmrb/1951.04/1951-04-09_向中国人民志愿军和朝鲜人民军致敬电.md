To the dear comrades of the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army:

　　You have heroically defeated the American and Rhee gangs in order to resist aggression and defend peace, raising the international status of China and Korea. We, the more than fifteen thousand Catholic followers in Tianjin, extend to you our most cordial, sincere, and highest respect. We are also willing to learn from you, to do well in our self-reliance and renovation movement, to forever sever all relations with imperialism, and to resolutely respond to the government's call: Resist America, Aid Korea, Oppose American Armed Japan, Eliminate Secret Agents and Bandits, and Consolidate National Defense. We further guarantee to support the front lines with labor production, to repay your merits.

      With respect,
