　　The Tong County People's Government Should Quickly Resolve Revolutionary Soldier Mu Tianyou's Land Issue
To the Editor:
    I am from Tong County, Hebei Province. My mother teaches in Xiaoshengmiao Village, Sixth District of this county, and has no house or land. After the liberation of Tong County, the army sent my family member certificate for military service to the Tong County People's Government. When land reform was implemented in the village, my family was not allocated land. At that time, the army sent another letter to the Tong County People's Government, but has never received a response.
    In October 1950, I personally took a letter from the army to the Civil Affairs Section of the Tong County People's Government to negotiate this matter. At that time, the cadres of the county, district, and Xiaoshengmiao Village all replied to me: "There are still reserved houses and land in the village that can be allocated to you, but we need to wait until after the autumn harvest to process it for you." However, half a year has passed, and they still have not processed it. For this reason, the regiment I belong to wrote another official letter to the Tong County Prefecture, but still received no reply. This dilatory style of not resolving problems is really unsatisfactory.

### 革命军人穆天佑的土地问题通县人民政府应速解决

专栏：来信摘要

　　革命军人穆天佑的土地问题通县人民政府应速解决编辑同志：
    我是河北省通县人。我母亲在本县六区小圣庙村教书，没有房屋和土地。通县解放后，部队即将我的军属证明书寄给通县人民政府。村中实行土地改革，却未给我家分地。当时又由部队给通县人民政府去信，但一直得不到回答。
    一九五零年十月，我自己带了部队的公函亲去通县人民政府民政科协商此事。当时县、区及小圣庙村的干部都答复我说：“村中还有保留的房屋和土地，可以分给你一分，但需要等到秋后才能给你办理。”可是，现在已过了半年，他们仍旧没有办理。为此，我所属的团部又给通县专署写去公函，还是得不到答复。这种拖延不解决问题的作风，实在不能令人满意。
　　        人民解放军某部六○三团穆天佑
