　　Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 17th: According to a Rome dispatch from Teletype News Agency, 200,000 people in Rome held a grand mass meeting in the Square of St. John on the evening of the 15th to celebrate the victorious conclusion of the Seventh National Congress of the Italian Communist Party.

　　The General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti, delivered a speech to the assembly. He solemnly declared: "The Italian people will never wage a criminal war of aggression against other peoples!" His response was a thunderous unanimous cry from 200,000 listeners: "Never!" Togliatti, on behalf of the Italian Communist Party, put forward a method to guarantee that Italy would not be dragged into a disastrous war of aggression, which is to organize a government of peace. He said: We must have a great shift in the attitude of the entire nation in Italy. We must take such actions to force the Gasperi government to no longer move along the path of war, a government that has linked its own fate with that of American imperialism. We must force our rulers to either abandon power or take another path. We propose a new path, which is to organize a government of peace. Togliatti emphasized: At a time when the international situation is becoming more tense and the shadow of war is becoming more gloomy, let us advocate for peace! This will allow Italy to withdraw from the front lines preparing for a new war. Togliatti finally called on Italians with various political views to act in unison to defend peace.

　　When Togliatti's speech ended, millions of torches were lit throughout the venue. In the blazing firelight, countless doves of peace painted by Picasso, tied to balloons, slowly rose.

　　庆祝意共第七次代表大会胜利闭幕
    罗马二十万人举行群众大会
    托里亚蒂号召争取组织和平政府
    【新华社十七日讯】据电通社罗马讯，为庆祝意大利共产党第七次全国代表大会胜利闭幕，罗马二十万人民十五日晚间在圣若望广场举行了盛大的群众大会。
    意共总书记托里亚蒂向大会发表演说。他庄严地宣布：“意大利人民决不对别国人民进行罪恶的侵略战争！”回答他的是二十万听众雷鸣似地同声高呼：“决不！”托里亚蒂代表意大利共产党提出了保证意大利不被拖入灾难性的侵略战争中的方法，这就是组织和平政府。他说：我们必须在意大利来一个全体国民态度的大转变。我们一定要采取这样的行动，迫使加斯贝利政府不能再沿着战争的道路前进，这个政府已经把它自己的命运和美帝国主义的命运联结在一起了。我们必须迫使我们的统治者不是放弃政权，就是改走另外一条路。我们建议采取一条新的道路，就是组织一个和平政府。托里亚蒂强调说：在这个国际形势更加紧张、战争阴霾更加低沉的时候，让我们倡议和平罢！这会使意大利从正在准备新战争的阵线中退出来。托里亚蒂最后呼吁抱有各种政治见解的意大利人一致行动，保卫和平。
    当托里亚蒂的演说结束的时候，全场燃起了千万把火炬。在熊熊的火光中，无数毕加索画的和平鸽子，系在轻气球上缓缓升起。
