　　“Grow More Cotton, One Somersault into the Sky!”
     ——Farmers in Jie County, Shanxi, Get Rich Growing Cotton
     Lu Jitong
     The farmers of Jie County, Shanxi, responding to the government's call to plant as much cotton as possible, have seen a leap in production and living standards in the past two years. Some farmers say, "Grow more cotton, one somersault into the sky!" This is absolutely true. Take the mutual aid group of Shi Caigui, a Shanxi provincial labor model, for example. All five households in their group were peasants who only gained their freedom in 1949. Last year, they turned seven mu of dry land into paddy fields, planted cotton, applied plenty of fertilizer, and hoed the fields seven times, harvesting over 1,700 jin of seed cotton in total.

    In Sanlousi Village, Jie County, where more cotton is grown, the farmers' food and clothing have greatly improved. Out of the village's 300 households, 90 households have bought flashlights, and 40 young people have put on sneakers.

    The farmers of Jie County have received various forms of assistance from the state in expanding their cotton fields. Thanks to loans from the People's Bank, Xizhanggeng Village has added 38 waterwheels and dug 46 wells, nearly doubling the village's paddy fields. In 1949, Dizhang Village had only 64 head of livestock. In the past two years, due to bank loans and increased income from cotton growing, the number of livestock has increased to 300. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company vigorously purchases cotton. In January and February of this year alone, it purchased 190,000 jin of last year's surplus cotton through various purchasing stations and cooperatives and sold more than 1.3 million jin of grain. Recently, it used over one million jin of grain to pre-purchase 150,000 jin of cotton from cotton farmers. Now, there are no farmers in the county who lack grain.

    The farmers of Jie County, with the help of the state, have expanded their cotton fields and increased their income, understanding the loveliness of the motherland from their own practical interests. In the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, this smallest county in the Yuncheng region was the county that donated the most and the fastest; in one month, it donated more than 12 million yuan.

    In response to the government's call to "expand cotton fields and increase unit yield," the farmers of Jie County are now actively carrying out patriotic production competitions. Party and Youth League members in Donggao Village have proposed: "We want to plant cotton all over the land!" Some farmers in Yang Village are preparing to plant all their irrigated and dry land with cotton. Wang Miaoqiao, a female Party member in Sanlousi Village, said to everyone: "Expanding cotton fields is not only for individual prosperity, but also for completing the state's tasks. We must ensure that people across the country do not wear foreign cloth or use foreign cotton."

    Preparations for cotton planting are now in full swing throughout the county. Women in Nanxia Village spent three days picking 480,000 jin of cotton seeds, enough for the village's 700 mu of cotton fields. In the fields, one can see nothing but newly turned wet soil and dense piles of manure newly delivered to the fields. Now, they are just waiting for planting.

　　“多种棉，一个筋头翻上天！”
     ——山西解县农民种棉发家
     路际通
     山西解县的农民，响应政府的号召，尽量多种棉花，近两年来，大家在生产和生活上真是飞跃上升。有的农民说：“多种棉，一个筋头翻上天！”这话一点不错。拿山西省劳动模范史采贵互助组来说，他们全组五户，都是一九四九年才翻身的农民。去年，他们把七亩旱地变成水田，种上棉花，粪上的足足的，锄了七遍，共收了一千七百多斤籽棉。
    解县种棉较多的三楼寺村，农民的吃用大改善。全村三百户人家，有九十户买了手电筒，有四十户的青年人穿上了球鞋。
    解县的农民在扩大棉田上，曾得到国家各种的帮助。由于人民银行的贷款，西张耿村新添了三十八部水车，打了四十六眼井，全村水田差不多增加一倍。底掌村在一九四九年只有六十四头牲口，两年来由于银行的贷款和种棉增加收入，牲口增加到三百头。花纱布公司大力收购棉花，仅今年一、二月份，通过各收购点和合作社即收购去年的余棉十九万斤，售出粮食一百三十余万斤。最近又以百余万斤粮食，向棉农预购棉花十五万斤。现在，全县已没有缺粮的农民。
    解县的农民因为在国家的帮助下，扩大棉田，增加了收入，他们从切身的利益中，了解到祖国的可爱。在抗美援朝运动中，这个运城专区最小的县份，却是捐款最多、最快的一个县；一个月内，就捐了一千二百多万元。
    解县的农民为响应政府“扩大棉田，提高单位产量”的号召，现正积极开展爱国丰产竞赛。东膏村的党、团员提出：“我们要把棉花种满地！”羊村有些农民准备把自己所有的水旱地都种成棉花。三楼寺村女党员王妙巧向大家说：“扩大棉田不仅是为着个人发家，也是为国家完成任务，我们要使全国人民不穿外国布，不用外国棉。”
    种棉准备工作现正在全县火热的进行着。南贾村的妇女，三天就拣完了全村七百亩棉田所需用的四十八万斤棉籽。在田地里，一眼望去，全是新翻的湿土和密密的新送到地里的粪堆。现在，只等着播种了。
