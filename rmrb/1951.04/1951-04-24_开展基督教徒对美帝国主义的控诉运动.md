　　Launch a Movement of Christian Accusations Against American Imperialism

At the meeting convened by the Religious Affairs Department of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council to handle Christian organizations receiving American subsidies, the attending representatives, through group meetings and general sessions, concentrated on accusing the imperialist elements and their running dogs, such as Bi Fanyu, Luo Aihua, Zhu Youyu, Chen Wenyuan, and Gu Renen – the dregs of Christianity. They also accused the World Council of Churches, manipulated by the American warmonger Dulles, of its sinful activities. This stirred up the attending representatives' hatred towards American imperialism and greatly enhanced Christian's patriotic zeal and determination to eliminate imperialist cultural aggression and implement the Three-Self Reform. Thus, the meeting achieved a satisfactory outcome. This experience is worth promoting among Christian organizations across the country, to universally launch a movement of accusations against American imperialism among Christians nationwide, in order to raise the political awareness of the broad masses of believers and clearly draw a line between them and imperialist elements and their running dogs.

The Christian accusation movement is a self-education movement for Christians based on their own experiences and what they have seen and heard about the crimes of American imperialism in persecuting the Chinese people. This is the most important method for popularizing and deeply developing the Three-Self Patriotic Movement among the broad masses of believers, and it is also the urgent demand of the broad masses of believers. Chinese Christians, like people from all walks of life, have suffered deeply from the oppression and humiliation of imperialism, especially American imperialism, for a hundred years, and they are filled with grief and indignation. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, they had nowhere to turn for redress. Now, under the leadership of the People's Government, they are eager to vent their accumulated grievances and pain that have been suppressed for many years. This is very natural. However, in the process of using Christianity to invade China, American imperialism not only utilized church organizations and some church figures, but also distorted the doctrines, using them as tools to oppose the cause of the Chinese people's liberation, and vigorously instilled slavish ideas. At the same time, it used so-called "charitable" and "cultural" institutions to cover up these ugly activities, so that its oppression and humiliation of Chinese Christians was coated with a thin layer of sugar, causing many believers to be deceived and not recognize the true face of American imperialism. As a result, some believers unconsciously regarded the enemy as a friend and the evil wolf as a sheep. Some people, although they have learned that American imperialism has indeed used Christianity as a tool of aggression, still dare not boldly expose their conspiracies because they are intimidated by imperialist elements and their running dogs. This has become an obstacle to the development of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, and an obstacle to mobilizing the broad masses of believers to actively and courageously fight against imperialist elements. The most effective way to remove this obstacle is to launch a movement of accusations against American imperialism, exposing its conspiratorial activities from all sides, so as to make the broad masses of believers recognize the baseness and viciousness of American imperialism, as well as its outwardly strong but inwardly weak paper tiger nature, and stimulate their love for the great motherland, their hatred for American imperialism that endangers the great motherland, and their enthusiasm for the anti-imperialist struggle.

American imperialism has long used Christianity for cultural aggression, and many believers have been deeply poisoned. Some believers have even been directly or indirectly used by American imperialism. Therefore, when they raise their political awareness in the process of making accusations, they will be saddened by the fact that they were too deeply poisoned in the past, they will expose the influence of this cultural aggression, they will report the imperialist elements hidden in the church, and they will expose the running dogs trained and arranged to be hidden by American imperialism, and assist the People's Government in clearing out these reactionary elements.

Christians throughout the country should actively participate in the movement of accusations against American imperialism. Every Christian should recognize that, as a Chinese, he should cherish his motherland, accuse American imperialism and its running dogs of using the church to invade China, and defend the great motherland; as a kind and devout believer, he should cherish his church, accuse American imperialism of defiling the church and using the church as a tool of aggression, in order to protect the religion of the Chinese people from the aggression and exploitation of foreign imperialism.

　　开展基督教徒对美帝国主义的控诉运动
    在政务院文化教育委员会宗教事务处召集的处理接受美国津贴的基督教团体的会议上，到会代表经过小组会和大会，集中控诉了帝国主义分子及其走狗毕范宇、骆爱华、朱友渔、陈文渊、顾仁恩等基督教的败类，控诉了美国战争贩子杜勒斯所操纵的世界基督教协进会的罪恶活动，激起了到会代表对美帝国主义的仇恨情绪，大大提高了基督教徒爱国热忱和肃清帝国主义文化侵略，实行三自革新的决心，因而使会议得到圆满的收获。这一经验，值得推广到全国基督教团体中去，在全国基督教徒中普遍展开控诉美帝国主义的运动，以提高广大教徒的政治觉悟，显明地划清与帝国主义分子及其走狗的界线。
    基督教徒的控诉运动，乃是基督教徒以亲身经受与耳闻目见的美帝国主义迫害中国人民的罪恶事实，进行自我教育的运动，这是在广大教徒中普及与深入开展三自革新运动的最重要的方法，也是广大教徒的迫切要求。中国的基督教徒，如同其他各界人民一样，百年来曾深受帝国主义特别是美帝国主义的压迫与侮辱，悲愤满怀，在国民党反动统治时期，他们无处伸诉；现在，在人民政府领导之下，他们迫切要求吐诉压抑了多年的心中积愤和苦痛，这是很自然的事情。但是，美帝国主义在利用基督教侵略中国的过程中，不仅利用了教会团体和部分教会人士，而且对教义也横加曲解，作为反对中国人民解放事业的工具，极力灌输奴化思想；同时，又利用所谓“慈善”和“文化”机关，掩盖这些丑恶活动，使它们对中国教徒的压迫与侮辱，裹上了薄薄的一层糖衣，致有不少教徒受了这种蒙蔽与欺骗，还不认识美帝国主义的真实面目。因而有些教徒不自觉地把敌人当作了朋友，把恶狼当作了绵羊。有些人虽然已经了解到美帝国主义确实利用基督教作了侵略工具；但因受帝国主义分子及其走狗的威吓，还不敢大胆地揭露它们的阴谋。这就成为开展三自革新运动的障碍，成为发动广大教徒积极勇敢地同帝国主义分子进行斗争的障碍。扫除这种障碍的最有效的办法，是开展对美帝国主义的控诉运动，从各方面揭露美帝国主义的阴谋活动，从而使广大教徒认识美帝国主义的卑鄙与凶狠，以及它外强中干的纸老虎本质，激发他们对伟大祖国的热爱，激发他们对危害伟大祖国的美帝国主义的仇恨和反帝国主义斗争的热情。
    美帝国主义曾经长期利用基督教进行文化侵略，使许多教徒中了很深的毒害，有些教徒甚至直接或间接地被美帝国主义所利用。因此，当他们在控诉过程中提高了政治觉悟以后，他们就会痛心于过去中毒太深，就会揭露这种文化侵略的影响，就会检举隐藏在教会中的帝国主义分子，检举美帝国主义训练和布置潜伏的走狗，协助人民政府清除这些反动分子。
    全国各地的基督教徒，都应该积极参加对美帝国主义的控诉运动。每一个基督教徒都应该认识，作为一个中国人，应该爱护自己的祖国，控诉美帝国主义及其走狗利用教会侵略中国的罪行，保卫伟大祖国；作为一个善良而虔诚的教徒，应该爱护自己的教会，控诉美帝国主义沾辱教会，把教会当作侵略工具的罪行，以保护中国人自己的宗教不受外国帝国主义的侵略与利用。
