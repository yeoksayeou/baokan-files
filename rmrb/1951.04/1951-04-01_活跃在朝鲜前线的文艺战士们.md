　　Literary and Art Soldiers Active on the Korean Front
    Wu Ming
    This is a large mountain gully, not far from the front lines. It's not as cold here as it is in North Korea. Although it still freezes at night, the snow begins to melt as soon as the sun comes out. In the evening, the artillery roars rumble, and various flares constantly flash nearby. Enemy planes fly overhead from time to time, firing bursts of blood-red tracer bullets. This place is only thirty li away from the enemy, but in the eyes of the soldiers, it is already the deep rear.
    The cultural troupe has organized an evening party for the soldiers. The soldiers have completely forgotten the fatigue of fighting the enemy during the day, and everyone is coming to participate with great enthusiasm.
    The venue is in front of a local's house. The bright moonlight shines on the white snow on the surrounding mountains, presenting a silver-white landscape. Besides this natural light, only one candle is lit at the venue for the prompter, which can be extinguished at any time. There are really a lot of people participating in the evening party, a large dark mass.
    With a whistle, the evening party begins. A burst of drumming, sometimes fast and sometimes slow, makes everyone in the audience smile. The first program is singing, a total of five songs: "American Planes are Big Flies," "The Chongchon River," "Touching the Big Cannon," "The Messenger," and "Volunteer Army Song." These songs are full of military flavor. While singing, some people in the audience beat time with their hands or feet, and some echo in a low voice. There are cries for an encore, and the actors have to promise to sing again after the play.
    The first play is a drama – "It Turned Out to Be Grandma," with only four characters, the content of which shows the close friendship between the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people. This short play is very dramatic and attracts the audience. The clothes of the female comrade who plays the old woman were temporarily exchanged with the landlord grandma behind the stage. The grandma, wearing the volunteer army uniform, watched the play in the audience, laughing so hard that she couldn't close her mouth, constantly saying "Chao Ximida!" (Good!) After the play, the female comrade walked off the stage, and the grandma hugged her. The female comrade asked for her opinion, and she said, "You are just like my sister!" It is said that later, when this grandma saw any female comrades in the Volunteer Army, she no longer called them "Comrade" but "Sister."
    The second is a piece of lyrics called "In a Bivouac," the general idea of which is that a certain unit of the Volunteer Army arrived at the bivouac without investigating the local customs, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the people. Later, the misunderstanding was resolved because we helped the masses with their work. The language is quite popular, full of humor, and appropriately adds some Korean words that everyone often says, so it constantly causes laughter.
    The third is a comic dialogue called "Digging Fortifications," which expresses the soldiers' experience in digging fortifications in combat through vivid images. Some soldiers who watched the play said, "The company commander and instructor constantly tell us how to dig fortifications, but it's not as clear as watching this play."
    "The True Face of the American Army" is a living newspaper play. The crazy American army, after being hit by us several times, has revealed its coward's true face, but the officers are still forcing the soldiers to fight. When the battle is urgent, the officers take off their hats as disguises and sneak away, and the remaining American soldiers also want to run. They discuss using a poker card game to decide who runs. Whoever draws the Queen of Spades first will fight on the position, and the rest will hide in the fortifications. The soldiers pray before drawing cards. As a result, one soldier draws it, but he comes up with a clever trick. He puts the machine gun on the fortification, ties one end of the rope to the machine gun trigger, and hides the other end of the rope in the fortification. When he pulls the rope, the machine gun starts firing. Our soldiers rush up, only hear the gunshots and see no one. Later, they found the rope and also captured the people. The audience laughed and swayed from beginning to end. When the enemy raised his hands and was caught out of the fortification, a soldier in the audience raised his electric carbine and shouted, "Deputy squad leader! Look at that guy, just like the one we caught on the 38th parallel!" The rest of the people also talked loudly about the "true face of the American army" and the "American way of life" they had seen on the battlefield.
    The Battle of Flying Tiger Mountain is a famous battle. Our soldiers hadn't eaten anything for three days and three nights. The soldiers grabbed snow to trick their stomachs. At this time, a Korean old woman led a group of women, braving the hail of bullets, to deliver cooked rice to our army's position on the top of the mountain. The soldiers ate this rice, which strengthened their determination to kill the enemy, and finally won the victory. This story is now expressed in the short play "On the Position." Among the five plays, in terms of form, this is a more serious play, and it is very touching. While the play was being performed, an enemy plane flew low overhead, but the play continued as usual, only the candle used for prompting was blown out.
    After the play, they sang several songs such as "Camping in the Woods" and "Fighting Tanks." In the end, the audience also sang along. The loud singing shocked the entire valley and suppressed the enemy's artillery fire. The evening party, which lasted more than two hours, satisfied the soldiers very much. The soldiers shouted as they walked, "Thank you to our cultural troupe for performing for us! We will guarantee more victories to answer the cultural troupe!"
    These programs are all based on the real events of the troops watching the play. In Korea, the volunteer army cultural troupes are generally welcomed by the soldiers. During the battle, the literary and art soldiers are scattered and deeply involved in various companies, carrying out front-line literary and art activities. They compile heroic deeds into short plays, comic dialogues, and ditties in a timely manner. On the march, on cold nights, they beat artillery shells and tirelessly mobilize in front and behind the ranks. When they sang "Why Endure Hardship" to the soldiers on the road, two soldiers jumped out of the ranks and enthusiastically and excitedly replied with a comic dialogue: "I know these difficulties, what is hateful is the American soldiers; I will remember what the comrades said and rush to the front line to avenge the hatred!" They powerfully encouraged the fighting will of the commanders and fighters, and together with the heroic soldiers, attacked the American aggressors at minus 30 degrees.
    Since entering Korea, in less than three months, the cultural troupe mentioned above has performed a total of fifteen times, each time with different new programs. The performance locations are generally in mountain gullies or rice paddy ridges on the edge of villages, or else under the eaves of local people's houses. In order to prevent air raids, performances are absolutely not allowed during the day. Even when performing at night, lights cannot be lit, so their plays do not use lighting.
    These fifteen performances do not only include fifteen evening parties. Some performances include several evening parties. After performing in this unit, they travel another ten or twenty li overnight to another unit, sometimes performing in three places in one night. As soon as the soldiers hear that the cultural troupe is coming, no matter how late it is, even if they haven't slept for a few days, they have to watch the play. The soldiers said: "As long as you come, we are happy."
    Under the welcome and love of the soldiers, the comrades of the cultural troupe, of course, do not care about everything else. They walk, recite lines, discuss, and perform during the march. After arriving at the destination, the play is rehearsed and performed at night.
    Their costumes and props are also very simple, all brought by themselves. A set of gongs and drums, several huqins, violins, etc. Anyway, the troops have a lot of captured American tarpaulins, so there is no need to bring curtains, let alone hard scenery. Most of the costumes and props are borrowed by whoever uses them. Because there are no lights, makeup is not used much. There is charcoal everywhere, which can solve the problem.
    In this process of less than three months, they created a total of sixteen scripts that have been performed, and many comic dialogues, lyrics, etc. Among the songs created, "Fighting Tanks" and other eleven songs have become popular in the troops. The programs we saw above only took seven days from writing the script to rehearsing and performing, and in these seven days, they marched for three days like the troops.
    It needs to be especially mentioned that although the comrades engaged in literary and art work in the Volunteer Army on the Korean front are working day and night with a selfless fighting spirit, it is still far from meeting the needs of the soldiers. Many soldiers hope to see more and better dramas and other performances, and to sing songs that encourage fighting spirit. They often ask what good plays and movies are currently being performed in various parts of the motherland, and repeatedly say: "Thank the people of the motherland for their enthusiastic support of the Volunteer Army; I hope to tell the literary and art circles of the motherland that the front line also very much needs literary and art activities and spiritual food."

### 活跃在朝鲜前线的文艺战士们

　　活跃在朝鲜前线的文艺战士们
    吴明
    这是一个大山沟，离开前线不远。这里不像北朝鲜那样冷，虽然夜晚仍要结冰，但太阳一出来，积雪便开始化了。傍晚的时候，炮声隆隆地响着，各色照明弹不断地在附近闪耀，天空中不时有敌人的飞机飞过，打一阵子血红的曳光弹。这里离开敌人才不过三十里，可是在战士们看来，已经是深远的后方了。
    文工团已给战士们组织起晚会来了。战士们已经完全忘记了白天冲杀敌人的疲劳，大家都兴致勃勃地来参加。
    会场是在一家老百姓的房子前面，天上皎洁的月光，映着四围山上白茫茫的积雪，大地呈现一片银白色，除这个大自然的灯光外，全会场只点了一支给提示人用的，随时可以吹熄的蜡烛。舞台是利用老百姓的一片比较宽大的木台阶，四周挂了几块写着Ｕ·Ｓ的大雨布，说是为遮风，实际只能算划道界线，不使人挤上舞台来。参加晚会的可真不少，黑压压的一大片。
    哨子一吹，晚会便开始了。一阵时急时缓的锣鼓，使看的人脸上都露出了笑容。第一个节目是唱歌，一共唱了五个歌子：《美国飞机大苍蝇》、《清川江》、《摸大炮》，《通讯员》、《志愿军之歌》，这些歌子都是部队风味十足，唱的时候，台下人有的用手或脚打着节拍，有的用低声应和。一片要求再唱的呼声，演员们只好答应看完戏再唱。
    第一个戏是话剧——《原来是老大娘》，只有四个角色，内容表现中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民的亲密友谊。这个短剧戏剧性很强，很吸引观众。演老大娘的女同志的衣服，就是与舞台后边那家房东老大娘临时换穿了一下，老大娘穿着志愿军的军服在台下看戏，笑得连嘴都合不上了，老是说“操西米达！”（好！）演完戏，女同志走下台来，老大娘把她抱着。女同志征求她的意见，她说：“你真像我的妹妹呀！”据说后来这个老大娘见了任何志愿军中的女同志，再不叫“同志”，而叫“妹妹”了。
    第二个是一段唱词，叫“在一次宿营中”，大意是说，志愿军某部到达宿营地，没有调查群众的风俗习惯，因而引起老百姓的不满，后来由于我们帮忙群众做活，才解除了误会。语言相当通俗，情趣横生，而且适当地加进了一些大家常说的朝鲜话，因此不断地引起笑声。
    第三个是一个快板剧叫《挖工事》，把战士们在作战中挖工事的经验，通过生动的形象表现出来。有些战士们看了这个剧说：“连长指导员不断地给咱讲怎样挖工事，但都没有看了这个戏那样清楚。”
    “美军原形”是一个活报剧。疯狂的美国军队，在经我们几次打击以后，已露出了他那懦夫的原形，但当官的还是逼着当兵的打，战斗一紧急，军官摘下帽子作伪装，自己偷跑，剩下的几个美国兵也想跑，他们商量用摸扑克牌的办法来决定谁跑。谁先摸着黑桃Ｑ谁就在阵地上打，其余的人便藏到工事里。士兵们在摸牌前大作祷告。摸的结果，一个士兵摸到了，可是他想了一个偷巧的办法，他把机枪放在工事上，用绳子一头拴着机枪扳机，自己牵了绳子的另一头也藏到工事里。一拉绳子机枪便打了起来，我们的战士冲上来，只听见枪响不见人，后来，发现了绳子，也俘虏了人。观众从头到尾都笑得东倒西歪。演到敌人举起双手从工事里被捉出来的时候，台下一个战士举起他的电发卡宾枪大声喊着：“副班长！你看那个家伙，就像咱们在三八线上捉到的那个一样！”其余的人也大声谈起了他们在战场上所看到的“美军原形”和“美国生活方式”来了。
    飞虎山战斗是著名的战役。我们的战士三天三夜没吃到东西，战士们抓起雪块哄骗自己的肚子，这时候，有一个朝鲜老太太领着一群妇女，冒着枪林弹雨，把做好的大米饭，送到山顶上我军阵地里来。战士们吃了这饭，更增强了杀敌决心，终于获得了胜利。这一故事现在已用“在阵地上”的短剧表现出来。五个剧中在形式上看，这是个比较严肃的剧，它很感动人。正在演出的时候，敌机从头上低空飞过，可是戏还是照样演下去，只把提示用的那支蜡烛吹熄了。
    剧演完后，又唱了《林中露营》、《打坦克》等几支歌子，唱到最后，台下人也唱了起来，嘹亮的歌声，震撼了整个山谷，把敌人的炮声都压了下去。两小时多的晚会，使战士们非常满意。战士们边走边喊：“感谢我们的文工团给我们演剧！我们要保证多打胜仗来回答文工团！”
    这些节目都是根据看戏的这个部队中他们的实事编成的。在朝鲜的志愿军文工团，普遍地受到战士们的欢迎。在作战过程中文艺战士们都分散地深入到各个连队，开展火线文艺活动。他们把英雄事迹及时地编成短剧、快板、小调。在进军途中，在寒风刺骨的夜里，他们敲打着炮弹筒，不知疲倦地在行列前后进行鼓动。当他们在路上向战士们演唱《为什么要艰苦》的时候，有两个战士从行列里跳出来，热情而兴奋地用快板回答道：“这些困难我知情，可恨的是美国兵；同志说的我记牢，赶到前线把仇报！”他们有力地鼓舞了指战员们的战斗意志，和英勇的战士们一同在零下三十度打击着美国侵略者。
    从入朝鲜以来不到三个月中，上面所说的那个文工团一共演出了十五次，每次都有不同的新节目，演出地点一般都在山沟里或村边的稻田埂子上，再不然就是老百姓的房檐下。为了防空，白天绝对不能演，夜晚演也不能点灯，所以他们的戏都不用灯光。
    这十五次演出中并不止开十五个晚会，有几次演出包括几个晚会，在这个单位演了后，连夜再走一、二十里路到别一个单位去，有时一夜连演三个地方。战士们一听见文工团来了，天再晚，几天不睡觉也得看戏，战士们说：“只要你们来，我们就高兴。”
    文工团的同志在战士们这样欢迎和热爱下，当然也不顾自己的一切，他们在行军中边走边对剧词、讨论、表演，到目的地后，戏排好，夜晚就出去演。
    他们的服装道具也很简单，都是自己带上，一套锣鼓，几把胡琴、提琴等，反正部队有的是缴获来的美国大油布，所以也不用带幕布，更不要说硬景。服装道具多半是谁用谁借。因为没有灯光，化装品也不大用，到处有黑炭，就可以解决问题。
    在这个不到三个月的过程中，他们一共创作了十六个演出过的剧本，和许多快板、唱词等。创作的歌子在部队流行开的有《打坦克》等十一首。以上我们看到的那些节目，从写剧本，到排好、演出，只化了七天的时间，而在这七天中，还和部队一样行军三天。
    需要特别提到的是：虽然在朝鲜前线志愿军搞文艺工作的同志，以忘我的战斗精神在日以继夜地工作着，但距离战士们的需要还差得很远。不少战士们希望看到更多更好的戏剧等各种演出，和唱鼓舞斗志的歌曲。他们常问起祖国各地目前有什么好的戏和电影在演，并再三地说：“感谢祖国的人民，对志愿军热情的支援；希望告诉祖国的文艺界，前线上也非常需要文艺活动和精神食粮。”
