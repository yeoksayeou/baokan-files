　　Northeast Shi Yuhai Group Achieves Accident-Free Record for Over Three Months
　  Successfully Fulfilling Challenge Conditions to Coal Miners Nationwide
    The Shi Yuhai group of the Northeast Xi'an Coal Mine has fulfilled the safe production challenge conditions they proposed to coal miners nationwide in anticipation of "May Day." In the competition, in addition to ensuring no liability accidents for more than three months, the Shi Yuhai group also overfulfilled the production task by 8.7 percent in the first quarter. The attendance rate reached more than 95 percent, and the consumption of raw materials was also reduced. For example, the consumption of pit wood was reduced by 29.8 percent compared with the quota. The group has completed the April production plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the plan by 2 percent.
    In order to fulfill the provisions of the challenge conditions regarding the expansion of cultural and technical learning, all workers in the group participated in pithead schools or technical schools, and regularly held joint meetings with technical personnel to study technical issues.
    Since the group proposed the challenge, further improvements have been made in safety equipment and safety systems. For example, in the past, only the group leaders handed over to each other during shift changes. Now, a shift handover system has been established between workers doing the same job. This makes the responsibility clearer and allows each worker to be familiar with the safety situation. In terms of roof management, they learned from advanced Soviet experience and thinned the roof protection plates. This not only increased the recovery rate but also ensured safe production.

### 东北施玉海小组三月余未出事故  胜利完成向全国煤矿工人挑战条件

　　东北施玉海小组三月余未出事故
　  胜利完成向全国煤矿工人挑战条件
    东北西安煤矿施玉海小组已实现了他们为迎接“五一”向全国煤矿工人提出的安全生产挑战条件。施玉海小组在竞赛中，除保证了三个多月未出任何责任事故外，并在第一季度超额完成生产任务百分之八点七，出勤率达到百分之九十五以上，原材料的消耗亦有降低，如坑木消耗即较定额降低了百分之二十九点八。该组已提前完成四月份生产计划，并超过计划百分之二。
    该组为履行挑战条件中关于展开文化、技术学习的规定，全组工人都参加了坑口学校或技术学校，并定期与技术人员开联席会，研究技术问题。
    该组自提出挑战后，在安全设备与安全制度方面又有了进一步的改进。如他们过去交接班时只是大组长之间互相交接，现在又按工种建立了同样工作的工人之间的交接班制度。这样就使责任更加明确，又使每个工人都能熟习安全情况。在顶板管理上，他们学习苏联先进经验，将顶板护顶片改薄。这不但增高了回采率，也保证了安全生产。
