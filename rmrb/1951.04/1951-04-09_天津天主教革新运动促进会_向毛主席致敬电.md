Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao

Respected Chairman Mao:

We are now reporting to you: The Tianjin Catholic Reformation Movement Promotion Association has been formally established today. We issued a reformation declaration on January 13th of this year, and after three months of arduous struggle, we shattered various conspiracies and sabotage by imperialists, and finally achieved today's victory. As of today, more than 15,000 Catholics have signed the declaration, demonstrating the determination and enthusiasm of Tianjin Catholics to resist imperialism, love the country, and love the church. This movement has won the support of all Catholics and the broad masses of the people. Under your wise leadership, we assure you that we will definitely do a good job in resisting imperialism, loving the country, and loving the church, and we are determined to sever all ties with imperialism, eliminate imperialist influence, thoroughly implement self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation, and respond to the government's call at any time, taking practical actions to complete the great task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending the country. Now we respectfully represent the clergy and all Catholics in Tianjin to extend our regards for your health.

And extend our highest respect!
	Tianjin Catholic Reformation Movement Promotion Association Founding Meeting
