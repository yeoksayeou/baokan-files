    The First Machine Factory Trade Union in Shenyang Abandons Leadership of Labor Insurance Work
    The chairman of the First Machine Factory Trade Union in Shenyang (concurrently the chairman of the Labor Insurance Committee) has abandoned leadership of the labor insurance work, resulting in serious chaos in the factory's labor insurance work. First, the labor insurance fund of more than 30 million yuan (Northeast currency) was lost on September 14th of last year. Economic procedures are extremely chaotic. More than half of the sanatorium's expenses have no official receipts. When workers receive various subsidies or relief funds, the trade union chairman rarely reviews or approves them, nor are receipts required. Only a small portion is stamped or fingerprinted on the expenditure warrants. Without the approval of the higher-level trade union, the factory's trade union labor insurance committee arbitrarily decided to spend 300,000 yuan per month from the labor insurance fund to cover the cooks' food expenses. The younger brother of Zhao Changling, the director of the first workshop, was already in his twenties when he died, but death and funeral subsidies were still collected as if he were a directly supported dependent. More than half of the factory's employees have not registered in accordance with labor insurance regulations, and those who have registered are very careless. Since its establishment, the Labor Insurance Committee has rarely held meetings or reviewed and summarized its work, and has not reported its work to the masses. The workshop labor insurance groups, labor insurance representatives, and the factory's labor insurance fund audit committee have not played a role; only one labor insurance committee member is doing the work, which is fundamentally inconsistent with the regulations for establishing various work committees in grassroots trade unions. Therefore, workers have many opinions about the trade union. Because of the problems with labor insurance work, production has not been successful either. The main reason for these shortcomings is that the trade union chairman lacks a correct understanding of the trade union's orientation towards production. He does not understand that orientation towards production refers to comprehensive trade union work, that all departments of the trade union must do their work well to ensure production, and to develop production into a full-fledged mass movement. Therefore, it is by no means just focusing on production and ignoring other work; on the contrary, labor insurance is an important part of the trade union's production-oriented work, and doing a good job in labor insurance can play a significant role in production. It is hoped that the First Machine Factory Trade Union will pay attention to this work in the future.

    Editor's note: In public enterprises, it is right for trade union cadres to assist the administration in solving production problems and leading workers to complete production tasks in order to guarantee the long-term interests of the workers. This is one aspect of trade union work. On the other hand, the trade union must lead in solving the current interests of the workers. The trade union represents the interests of the workers and must take appropriate care of both. Like the First Machine Factory Trade Union in Shenyang, abandoning one of its important tasks—leading workers to realize labor insurance—is wrong. Any one-sided production view or one-sided employee welfare view will cause losses to national production and workers' interests.

### 沈阳第一机器厂工会放弃领导劳动保险工作

    沈阳第一机器厂工会放弃领导劳动保险工作
    沈阳第一机器厂工会主席（兼劳动保险委员会主任委员）放弃对劳动保险工作的领导，造成该厂劳动保险工作的严重混乱状态。首先是劳动保险基金竟于去年九月十四日丢失了三千多万元（东北币下同）。经济手续十分紊乱，疗养所的开支，一半以上没有正式收据。工友领取各项补助金或救济金时，工会主席很少加以审查和批示，也不要收据。只有一小部分在支出传票上盖章或按指纹。未经上级工会批准，该厂工会劳动保险委员，竟擅自决定每月从劳动保险基金中给伙夫开支伙食费三十万元。第一车间主任赵长龄的弟弟已二十多岁，病故时也按照直系供养亲属领了死亡丧葬补助金。全厂半数以上的职工，不执行劳动保险规定进行登记，已登记的也很马虎。劳动保险委员会自成立以来，很少开会和检查总结工作，更没有向群众报告过工作。车间劳动保险小组、劳动保险代表及该厂劳动保险基金审核委员会都没有起作用，只有劳动保险委员一人在搞，根本不合基层工会建立各种工作委员会的规定。因此工人对工会意见很多。由于劳动保险工作存在问题，因而生产也没有搞好。产生这些缺点的主要原因是：工会主席对工会面向生产缺乏正确的认识。不懂面向生产是指全面的工会工作，是工会各部门工作都要做好，以保证生产，将生产发展为饱满的群众性运动。因此，就绝不是单抓生产，不管其他的工作；相反的，劳动保险是工会面向生产的重要工作的一环，做好了劳动保险对生产能起很大的作用。希望第一机器厂工会今后能注意这一工作。

    编者按：在公营企业中，工会干部协助行政解决生产中问题，领导工人完成生产任务，以保证工人的长远利益，这是对的，是工会工作的一方面。另一方面，工会必须领导解决工人的当前利益问题。工会是代表工人利益的，对两者必须适当照顾。像沈阳机器一厂工会，放弃了本身重要工作之一——领导工人实现劳动保险，是错误的。任何只强调一方面的片面生产观点和片面的职工福利观点，都会造成国家生产和工人利益的损失。
