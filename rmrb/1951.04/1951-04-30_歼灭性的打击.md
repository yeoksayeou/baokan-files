On February 11th, the eighteenth day of the 230,000-strong enemy's all-out northward advance, the U.S. and Syngman Rhee's bandit troops suffered another annihilating blow, with 12,900 men wiped out in the Hengcheng area in just one day and night.

This blow was dealt on the main offensive position of the enemy's central front. At that time, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army on the Han River front were heroically resisting, holding the enemy's main force in the western sector. The enemy's line north of Hengcheng had become an exposed flank, but the enemy still frantically advanced along the Yuanju-Chuncheon highway. By noon on the 11th, their forward units had crossed the highway intersection fifty miles north of Hengcheng. Long-range artillery was already bombarding northward on the intersecting highway more than twenty miles to the rear. The entire 8th Division of the Syngman Rhee bandit army and part of the U.S. invading army's 2nd Division had deployed their main forces on Shengzhi Peak between these three highways.

The Shengzhi Peak's mountains and ridges stretch for twenty to thirty miles, with two main peaks reaching 800 meters and 773 meters respectively. The enemy, relying on the natural barrier of the main peak and with their backs to the intersecting highway, thought themselves like a pair of pliers with a fully opened tiger's mouth—advancing, they could unleash thousands of shells, using so-called "destructive bombardment" to "clear the road" for the offensive spearhead; retreating, the forward mountain positions, like the tiger's mouth's teeth, could cover the main force's retreat to the highway under the same artillery support.

This is the "initiative in tactical operations" that the U.S. invading army desperately boasts about. Its aggressive ambitions make it so greedy that it stubbornly sees the failures predetermined by the past three battles as "tactical errors." However, righteous punishment cannot be escaped by any "tactics." As the soldiers of a certain unit of the Volunteers often say, "You're called Truman, I'm called 'Better Than You'!" When they suddenly appear in front of the enemy, they not only have the ability to break the enemy's offensive teeth in one fell swoop, but also have the ability to insert themselves into the tiger's mouth and cut off the enemy's retreat.

  Strong Ascent of Six Fishbone Peaks

To strike head-on and cut off the enemy's retreat; to penetrate the twenty-mile-deep mountain position in three and a half hours, and to capture their rear command center, Guangtiantai, before the enemy becomes disorganized—such a heroic advance that sweeps away everything is beyond the comprehension of the invading army's generals, not to mention fighting, even just walking.

Take the 700-meter-high Hedong Nanshan as an example. This is one of the enemy's forward offensive positions. The six peaks are like six steamed buns, and the slopes are as steep as fish backbones. In the words of the soldiers, "When you stand, your mouth can kiss the ground." The mountain road is so narrow that there is no room for two people to stand side by side, and the attacking troops can only charge one after another. The slope is so steep that shooting at the top of the mountain can injure your own people in front. Only the first few people in the entire assault company can bring their firepower to bear. However, the accumulated snow in early spring is so slippery that even holding onto branches and rocks with both hands, your feet still slide down, let alone shooting and charging at the same time. The brave men simply carried their guns on their backs, freeing up their hands, and even if there were no branches or rocks, they would insert their hands into the snow and climb upward, until the enemy's sniper bullets constantly splashed snow and gravel around their feet, then they would find a place where they could barely stand, stomp out a snow nest, stabilize their feet, take off their guns and return fire a few times, and then quickly carry their guns on their backs and continue climbing. And when descending the mountain, the brave men advanced by running and rolling. Some spread their legs and slid down while sitting, some rode on wooden sticks and flew down, some hugged their weapons and rolled down hundreds of meters of snow slope, and some even knocked down pine trees by the roots without stopping.

At that time, it was five o'clock in the afternoon, and the general attack's barrage began to bombard the enemy's position. Enemy planes were frantically searching for the suddenly appearing People's Volunteer artillery and the follow-up troops that occasionally crossed the highway. Red tracer bullets flew wildly through the valley, sparks burst from the rocks, and exploding shells threw ice and snow all over the head. On this fiery steep cliff, the Volunteer assault company was not just thinking about the six mountain peaks, but about annihilating an entire division of the enemy. If this gap could not be opened, the main force would not be able to penetrate the enemy's heart, and the brotherly units would not be able to cut off the enemy's retreat smoothly. The assault company commander said, "We must open a gap even if it is a mountain of knives!" The soldiers then said, "Charging up the mountain is victory!" Even if they were exhausted to the point of fainting, they would not forget to grab branches and grip their weapons in their daze, just suck on the snow on the rocks, take a breath, open their eyes and climb forward again.

For this victory, various artillery pieces were also advancing on the same road. The artillerymen unloaded the cannons, tied them with ropes, and carried them piece by piece, pulling in front and pushing in the back. If the ropes were not long enough, they would form "human ropes," set up "human ladders," and fight with the overhanging cliffs and steep slopes, using every imaginable method to transport the cannons forward. When the horses caught up with the assault troops with weapons and ammunition, even they themselves were shocked, not knowing how they had crossed the mountain with people and cannons.

In an instant—the first grenade hit the top of the mountain, and the brave men of the assault company immediately boiled over. The fire that reddened Andong City and Sinuiju in the great motherland, the thousands of miles of ruins from the Yalu River to the Han River, the Korean infants tearing at their mother's bloody corpses on the roadside, the Korean girls dying in the arms of American beast soldiers—all the hatred and vows ignited in the days of the sorrowful march were now condensed into the simplest battle cry: "The time to fulfill our determination has come!" The brave men encouraged each other as they charged towards the enemy. As soon as the thick smoke of the explosion filled the top of the mountain, the assault squad had already rushed to the enemy's side. Automatic rifles on both sides were firing fiercely, and the machine gunner had already circled to the rear of the position. They could not find a firing position on the steep cliff, so they held up the machine gun and swept it like a submachine gun. The 60mm mortar also caught up with the grenades, and the little gunner stomped out a snow nest on the spot, using his feet to hold the base plate and his hands to grab the barrel as a gun mount, letting the muzzle point straight to the sky, and firing fiercely at a short distance of less than seventy meters.

This was a short and fierce battle for the mountain top. The assault company captured six mountain peaks. The company commander, political instructor, and four platoon leaders were wounded one after another. There were still six more peaks ahead. The blood of comrades cannot be shed in vain. One said, "I'll be the acting company commander!" Another said, "I'll lead the assault squad." As soon as the new assault group was organized, the machine gun group collected a full bag of bullets. Soldier Li Cai was seriously wounded in the shoulder, but he resolutely broke free from the medic's hand, and said as he charged, "Bandage me after we eliminate the enemy." He shot down four enemies before all the bullets he carried were used up, and then captured a prisoner with his empty gun. Squad leader Sun Futang, who was suddenly wounded in the back of his foot, fell headfirst, then quickly climbed up again: "We Chinese can never bow our heads to the enemy! I will climb up and eliminate the enemy!" He limped onto the sixth mountain peak. The fierce battle boiled on the highest peak of Hedong. Just as fresh blood was flowing from his feet, the carbine roared in his hands again. He rushed into the enemy's formation and shot down a dozen enemies in one breath, and the bloodstains under his feet were like an arrow of victory pointing south—the gap was opened. The assault company, at the cost of forty-nine casualties, killed and wounded more than sixty enemies and captured more than ten, but the main thing was that they had opened a road for advancement.

  A Dagger Plunging Thirty Li Deep

When the forward battle began to erupt, another assault force rushed across the highway and plunged into the snow valley between the two "teeth" less than seven miles apart.

They advanced so quickly and quietly that the enemy's search detachment walking on the highway was just smoking and humming vulgar songs, not knowing that their mobile sentries had been cut off several times. And the eighth squad of a certain unit of the Volunteers at the forefront of the column, when they overwhelmed the blocking enemy with a burst of fire, deputy squad leader Wang Buxiang grabbed a puppet soldier around the waist and threw him to the ground, then suddenly released his hands, only kicked him once, and went after the team. He remembered that his task was not to capture a prisoner, but to capture an entire division of the enemy.

This was the "dagger force" eighth squad, which volunteered to be the first to plunge into the enemy's heart. They had won the assault mission in the assault company of the assault battalion, which became the "tip of the dagger" of the entire force. "Rapidly and boldly penetrate, do not curl the tip of the dagger halfway." This was an arduous and glorious task. As early as noon, when the enemy's artillery fire concentrated on the bombardment, they happily said in the shelter, "Truman, oh Truman, you are drumming and gonging before the show even starts, how lively, as soon as we make our entrance, you will have to play a mute." As soon as the signal for the general attack was raised, they evaded the enemy's aerial search, passed through twenty miles of mountainous terrain, and began to drill into the deep ditch from the enemy's "tooth gap," leaving the "fire blockade zone" boasted by the enemy behind.

However, Zhang Honglin, the assault company commander who was closely following the eighth squad, was particularly nervous at the time. The Dahuang Ditch was sandwiched between two major peaks, and the mouths of the ditch at both the north and south ends were connected to the highway, but a 700-meter-high mountain ridge crossed in the middle, with only firewood trails to walk on, and even the Korean guides living at the mouth of the ditch got lost. The two regiments of the puppet 8th Division were in the mountains on both sides, but there was only darkness and silence in front of them. Holding a compass, he grasped the direction of the entire force, only feeling that the cold shadows of the peaks and mountains were like lurking monsters. A sudden fierce battle could break out at any time. Overwhelming the blocking enemy—with such a determination, the soldiers would overwhelm it even if it was a mountain of knives as long as he shouted, "The time to fulfill our determination has come!" But the decisive battle was still ahead, and shedding a little more blood or delaying for a minute along the way would affect the overall situation. When a soldier decided to dedicate his life to the motherland and throw himself into the Korean battlefield, how much he hoped that he could kill more enemies, win more battles, and create more merit for world peace? The assault company commander felt that what he held in his hand was not a compass, but the lives and honor of the entire company, and his thousand and one anxious feelings were poured into one determination: "Penetrate rapidly, just advance if you don't encounter the enemy, and advance while fighting if you encounter the enemy!" He encouraged them along the way. And Zhou Xiangshuang, the leader of the sharp knife squad rushing in the front, when he discovered the sparks of cigarette butts flashing on the mountain village, continued to advance, until several enemies ran down and greeted him in Korean, then he shouted "Unfold!" The burst-firing carbine held in front of his chest also swept fiercely at the same time, shooting down four enemies in one breath, and then chasing up the mountain. The caught-off-guard enemy collapsed, and then counterattacked. Shooter Liu Shumu had already rushed to the flank of the squad leader, and he held up his machine gun and shot down four enemies head-on, chasing down and capturing four more prisoners. When the fierce firepower of the assault company turned into sporadic search gunfire, the follow-up troops had begun to pass through the mountain village safely.

The assault company advanced so rapidly and bravely. Some soldiers on the steep cliffs could not climb, so they said, "If we occupy the mountain top, there will be no problem for the main force to pass through, victory is just a matter of gritting your teeth." The fire net of snipers covering from the big mountains on the roadside, they said, "Don't be afraid of side shots. We can't get up, and the enemy can't get down. Advancing is victory." A fierce burst of gunfire erupted on the way back, they said, "The follow-up troops will definitely be able to fight over. Our retreat cannot be cut off, and the enemy will be in chaos if their retreat is cut off. Boldly penetrating is victory." The blocking enemy was overwhelmed, they said, "Don't capture prisoners or guns, a bigger victory is ahead. Gaining the upper hand means a big victory." The assault seventh company, with the eighth squad as the "sharp knife," became an unstoppable sharp knife, overwhelmed four blockades along the way, and occupied the mouth of the ditch on the road from west to east on the side and rear of Guangtiantai at 9:30 that night, opening up the road for the entire assault force to enter the heart of the enemy.

At 11:30 p.m., the fierce battle between the Volunteers and the puppet Rhee army's 10th regiment for the main peak 800 highland was fiercely unfolding, and the battle to forcefully attack the puppet Rhee army's 16th regiment's 773 highland had not yet begun. At this time, a row of car lights several miles long suddenly appeared on the highway, speeding eastward.

These were the cars of the U.S. 2nd Division's heavy artillery battalion and the puppet Rhee army's 8th Division headquarters. The first car, far from the vehicle group, rushed through the mouth of the ditch and drove towards Guangtiantai. Obviously, the enemy still thought that this road hidden deep behind the flanks of the two main peak positions was still a good position for long-range artillery. It was not until the 8th company of the Volunteers stationed in Guangtiantai destroyed the first car that all the torches suddenly went out and the cars stopped.

But the sound of the engines did not stop, but roared instead. Three heavy tanks rolled forward at the head, firing dense fan-shaped fire nets. The automatic weapons on the cars and howitzer tractors also swept fiercely to both sides of the road.

The enemy wanted to break through, to rush towards the north-south highway leading directly to Yuanju. The light and heavy machine guns of the assault battalion seized a row of small hills along the mouth of the ditch. The assault seventh company rushed to the highway first. The sharp knife eighth squad inserted itself into the ditch along the north side of the road. The brave men who had experienced the three battles fired even fiercer sniper fire with the same American-made automatic weapons. The demolition men of the assault platoon threw themselves at the tanks under the interweaving fire nets, and the first tank, as tall as a house, was blown up and stopped moving.

  Heroic Battalion Commander and Heroic Soldiers

But suddenly, the immobile tank spewed out flames and roared again, rushing through the fire net of the seventh company and the sniper position of the eighth company, desperately fleeing to the highway intersection. The remaining two tanks also took the opportunity to escape.

The automatic weapons and light curved-trajectory weapons on the cars behind also fired desperately. The howitzers on the tanks bombed the air wildly. The five-mile-long motorcycle column, like a fiery serpent, followed the two tanks and rushed towards Guangtiantai. This was the "artillery superiority" boasted by the enemy. We must eliminate this "advantage." Yu Shuilin, a Communist Party member of the eighth company, picked up an anti-tank grenade and rushed onto the highway, but the second tank rolled over him. In this extremely dangerous moment, he was not knocked down by the rolling gears, but supported himself on it, ran a few steps, and, taking advantage of the light from the shells, aimed at the vital point, and suddenly blew up the heavy tank, setting it on fire, and then seriously damaged the second one in the same way. A large truck full of American soldiers was also destroyed by him with two grenades.

The wounded tank, emitting fire, was still struggling to move forward, when it was hit by a rocket from the front. - The Volunteer artillery, who had just struggled in the mountains and on the snowy roads, had already set up American-made rocket launchers, anti-tank guns, and infantry guns along the highway and struck head-on. The pile of iron wreckage blocked more than 140 cars and tanks on the highway. The enemy in the cars had been knocked to the ground by the infantry who were attacking in the waist. This was a good opportunity to seize spoils of war. But Li Yucai, the commander of the assault battalion, said: "The artillery and cars can't run away anyway, they will all be ours after we eliminate the enemy. Continue to advance!" The young battalion commander Li Yucai had won the title of hero in the battle with his brave, resourceful, and decisive command. With the experience of the three battles, he looked at the clusters of light from the shells on the mountain, as if he saw the cunning enemy. They avoided night battles, scattered and hid in the mountains, waiting for dawn so that the planes could cover them to regroup and fight again. Originally, Nanshan, Beishan, and Bihushan in Guangtiantai, which were tightly sandwiched between the highway forks, were the positions of the 21st regiment of the puppet Rhee army's 8th division and the 9th regiment of the U.S. 2nd division, plus the enemy who had fled from the cars. There were at least 3,000 U.S. and Rhee bandit troops concentrated in this area. On this section of the highway less than three miles long, there were sparks of blood and fire everywhere on the undulating and intricate large and small high ground. The assault force was in the encirclement of the enemy's superior forces. We must quickly disrupt the enemy! The assault battalion immediately organized itself into many independent penetrating assault daggers, one company after another, one platoon after another, and struck at the mountain tops where the gunfire was dense. But the "sharp knife" seventh company, which was inserted into Nanshan in Guangtiantai, was suppressed on the side of the highway by the suddenly strengthened firepower before it could launch an attack.

This was the commanding height of the Guangtiantai area. If Nanshan could not be captured, it would be difficult for the assault force to deploy its forces, and the brotherly forces who were detouring Hengcheng from the right flank would lose the barrier for their advance, and it was imperative to capture it resolutely. However, the "sharp knife" eighth squad and the assault platoon were suppressed in the depression at the foot of the mountain by three-sided firepower and could not lift their heads. It was exactly 4:00 a.m. on the 12th, and the heroic battalion commander Li Yucai, who personally led the seventh company, was facing the battlefield test that commanders often encounter, and the most intense and stressful one. This was the intense and meticulous thinking before the decision was made, and the fierce struggle aroused in an instant by the sudden appearance of bad enemy conditions. If we capture it resolutely, the blood will not be shed in vain. But a commander of a people's army, who forgets to eat and sleep and thinks day and night on the battlefield, is not only for winning battles, but also for fighting a beautiful battle with very few casualties and great results. The commander's sense of responsibility made him forget that bullets were flying around him. He continued to stand in front of the 522-meter-high mountain, staring at the black shadows of the seven peaks, examining every mountain top firing point that was firing madly. Suddenly he felt that the people climbing on the mountain were a group of stupid pigs sticking out their butts and arching their mouths at the highway.

"Give him a kick from behind!" he decided decisively. The soldiers then realized the heroic battalion commander's determination with heroic battles. Shooter Liao Yuanben suddenly stood up straight from the depression, knelt down and held up his light machine gun and shot at the mountain. Although the three-sided fire net turned towards him immediately, the brave young League member did not relax the heavy machine gun that was firing the most urgently on the opposite mountain. The bullets that were flying around him flew higher and higher, as if he saw the enemy shrinking their heads under the machine gun, and he simply stood up and shot fiercely. The gun barrel turned red, but he could not bear to let go of his hands that were being burned, and he fired 873 bullets in one breath, forcibly suppressing one side of the enemy's firepower. After the assault platoon safely withdrew from the enemy's fire blockade zone and quickly transferred to the northwest corner of Nanshan in Guangtiantai, the brave men, who had fought fiercely all night, climbed over three mountain peaks in one breath and launched a sudden attack on the enemy who was smoking. They captured four top positions in a row from behind the enemy in just one and a half hours. And the first to rush to the highest peak was still the heroic sharp knife eighth squad. Although only squad leader Zhou Xiangshuang, shooter Liu Shumu and four other people were left in this heroic squad, the assault firepower of the four guns was still so fierce that they disrupted the enemy's position before the enemy could turn around.

  Encircle and Annihilate the Enemy in the Enemy's Heart

While the Nanshan attack was developing smoothly, a fierce battle that lasted for two consecutive hours broke out at the southeastern end of Beishan in Guangtiantai.

This was a narrow mountain leg wedged into the highway fork. The two platoons of the fifth company of the second battalion, which had inserted themselves there from Guangtiantai, were suddenly counterattacked by an enemy dozens of times their size. The two brave men Sun Lianji and Shi Yubao had just destroyed the first tank that had rushed to the front, and the highway fork was also cut off by the melee. In the raging fire of the tank, groups of enemy soldiers appeared and disappeared in the ditch along the highway, rushing eastward. More than sixty cars full of enemy soldiers on the north-south highway were rushing south. The enemy on Bihushan on the east side also bombarded and swept the small mountain leg. The mouth of the highway became the focus of the enemy's frantic counterattack on three sides.

Under the three-sided fire net, the brave men of the fifth and sixth companies sometimes crossed the highway, sometimes chased to the ditch, forcefully fought their way through the enemy group, and then fiercely fought their way back, scattering the enemy. But the enemy that had been scattered had not been wiped out. They huddled on the foothills under the steep cliffs of Nanshan, the ditches of the highway trunk line, and the highlands on the east side. When more than thirty enemy planes suddenly appeared in the early morning, the counterattack shells immediately bombarded the narrow small mountain leg. The enemy wanted to break through on a large scale. Thousands of enemy soldiers poured into the cars, desperately shooting south while accelerating to escape. The enemy planes that swept over the mountain tops were anxiously circling overhead. The curved-trajectory guns of Bihushan fiercely bombarded the small mountain leg filled with smoke and fire. Although the American wounded crawling all over the ground waved their hands to their partners in the cars for help, the speeding cars were still reluctant to let go of this good opportunity to break through. Suddenly, stubborn light spewed out from the cannon smoke again, it was the Volunteer warriors who rushed out to meet them head-on. The first car crashed head-on into the ditch, and the second car crashed violently into the car in front, also stopping.

The panicked enemy then rolled out of the cars, drilled into the ditch, regrouped, and charged south again, flanked by car columns, but were beaten back, ran back to hide, fired artillery, and then got back in the cars and charged again. Thousands of U.S. and Rhee bandit troops repeatedly charged four times, but still failed to break through the highway fork. The more enemy soldiers came to counterattack, the more fiercely the soldiers fought to meet them. They were so selfless, charging forward fiercely and plunging forward in the melee. They could not be brought back for a while. Only company commander Li Yishan and three soldiers were left to defend the mountain top, and they were still full of confidence.

"Anyway, the brotherly forces will be fighting over soon, we must hold this intersection even if there is only one person left." As company commander Li said, he grabbed the messenger's Mauser rifle and led three people to beat back the enemy's counterattack from the cars. The artery in his leg was broken, but he still insisted on directing the battle on the position. The messenger ran twice to grab the gun and asked him to withdraw from the front line, but he firmly refused both times and ordered, "Go ahead and tell the assault platoon leader to continue fighting." He did not let go of the Mauser rifle in his hand until he sacrificed, showing the lofty quality of self-sacrifice of a Communist Party member. It was this tenacious battle to shed blood generously in order to annihilate the enemy that forcibly blocked the enemy's breakthrough channels from north to south and from west to east for two hours. Until the two assault platoon leaders, Dong Yuqing and Xie Jingui, and more than a dozen heroic soldiers sacrificed heroically, Lin Rongshou, a machine gunner who was separated in the melee, still automatically organized himself with five soldiers, fighting back and forth on the highway fork. Two machine guns were destroyed by the enemy, and he found the third one to continue fighting. When the machine gun bullets were used up, he picked up a carbine and an automatic rifle and fired stubbornly.

At this moment, the righteous punishment for annihilating the enemy began: the brotherly forces detouring on the flank had already met in Hengcheng in the south, and the brotherly forces attacking from the front began to appear in the mountains in the north. The 10th and 16th regiments of the puppet Rhee army's 8th division, which were entrenched on the two main peaks of Shengzhi Peak, collapsed all over the mountains. The Chenggu depression north of Guangtiantai alone was crowded with more than a thousand U.S. and Rhee bandit troops.

The U.S. and Rhee bandit troops, who had collapsed in the mountains, were still desperately sending radio messages, setting up air contact boards, and asking the enemy planes that were flying around in the sky for help. But as the Volunteer warriors said: "You circle around in the sky, and I will do the same on the ground!" The warriors only focused on the penetrating battle of capturing prisoners. You Fenglin's squad of the third company of a certain unit, which was inserted into Chenggu from the mountains, swept into the snow valley, forcibly divided the enemy group of more than 500 people who continued to resist into two halves, and then turned back and fought from the enemy group back to the top of the mountain. Jiang Yuquan's squad of the ninth company of the assault battalion blocked hundreds of enemies head-on in an hour-long melee. When the enemy completely lost their will to fight and only cared about fleeing in all directions, the warriors used the firepower of pursuit to intercept the way, sweeping around the fleeing enemy like a whip driving a flock of sheep, and then capturing them. As the heroic company that bravely blocked the highway mouth firmly believed, their blood would not be shed in vain. Only six hours later, the brotherly forces captured more than 7,300 puppet Rhee army soldiers and more than 550 American soldiers. Among the large number of spoils of war placed on the Guangtian-Hengcheng line were 567 cars, 14 tanks, and 57 howitzers.

　　歼灭性的打击
    新华社特派记者　华山
    二月十一日，正是二十三万敌人全力北犯的第十八天，美、李匪军又遭到一次歼灭性的打击，一万二千九百人只一昼夜便在横城地区覆没了。
    这一打击是在敌人中部战线的进攻主阵地上进行的。当时汉江前线的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，正以英雄式的抗击战，把敌人主力箝制在西线地区。越过横城以北的敌人的战线，已经成为暴露的侧翼，可是敌人仍旧疯狂地沿着原州——春川公路猛犯着。到了十一日中午，其前沿部队已经越过横城以北五十里的公路交叉点。远射程炮队已经在侧后二十余里的交叉公路上向北轰击。李承晚匪军第八师全部及美侵略军第二师的一部已经在这三条公路间的圣智峰展开其主力了。
    圣智峰的丛山峻岭纵横二三十里，两座主峰高达八零零公尺和七七三公尺。敌人依托主峰天险，背靠交叉公路，自以为像满张着虎口的一把老虎钳—进可以泻出成千发的炮弹，用所谓“毁灭的轰击”给进攻矛头“肃清道路”，退则前沿山头阵地如同虎口的门牙，可以在同样的炮火支援下掩护主力从容撤回公路逃跑。
    这就是美国侵犯军所拼命吹嘘的“力争战术上的主动”。侵略野心使它如此贪婪，以至它硬把过去三次战役注定的失败看成“战术上的错误”。可是，正义的惩罚终不是借助于任何“战术”所能逃脱的。正如志愿军某部战士们经常所说的：“你叫杜鲁门，我叫‘比你强’！”当他们突然在敌人面前出现的时候，他们不仅有本事一举敲断敌人的进攻门牙；而且有本事从虎口硬插进去，把敌人的退路一举切断。
  强登六座鱼脊高峰
    又要迎头痛击，又要断敌后路；三个半钟头打透了纵深二十余里的山岳阵地，不等敌人混乱就攻占其侧后的指挥中心广田台——这样横扫一切的英雄进军，不说打仗，光走路也是侵略军的将军们所无法理解的。
    拿高达七百多公尺的鹤洞南山为例，这是敌人的前沿进攻阵地之一，六座山峰好像六个馒头，山坡都像鱼脊梁骨那样陡，用战士的话说：“人站着，嘴就啃到地皮了”。山路这样窄，并排站两个人就没处落脚，攻击部队只能一个跟着一个冲。山坡这样陡，朝山头打枪就能伤着前面的自己人。整个突击连只有头里几个人可以发挥火力。可是，初春的积雪这样滑，两手攀住树枝岩石，双脚还要往下溜，更不用说一面打枪一面冲锋了。勇士们干脆大背起枪，腾出双手，那怕没有树枝岩石，也要把手插到雪里往上爬，直到敌人狙击的子弹老在脚边溅起雪花碎石的时候，才找个勉强可以落脚的地方，就地踏个雪窝，站稳双脚，摘下枪来还击几下，又赶紧大背起枪继续攀登。而下山的时候，勇士们便连跑带滚地前进。有的叉开两腿坐着往下溜，有的骑着木棍往下飞跑，有的抱住武器一溜风滚下几百公尺的雪坡，有人甚至把松树连根撞倒了也顾不得停下脚来。
    当时正是午后五点钟，总攻击的排炮开始向敌人阵地猛轰。敌机正在仓皇地寻找突然出现的人民志愿军的炮兵和不时横过公路的后续部队。红色的曳光弹满谷乱飞，岩头迸着火星，炮弹爆炸时扬过来满头冰雪。在这战火纷飞的陡岩上，志愿军突击连想的不只是六座山头，而是要歼灭整师敌人。打不开这个缺口，主力就无法打进敌人腹心，兄弟部队就不能顺利地断敌后路。突击连长说：“是刀山也要打开个缺口！”战士便说：“冲上山是胜利！”他们那怕累得昏倒了，昏厥中还是忘不了攀住树枝，握紧武器，只是吮吮岩头的积雪，缓一口气，张开眼睛又爬起前进了。
    为了这次胜利，各种炮也在同样的路上前进着。炮兵们把炮卸开，拴上绳子，一件件地用人扛着，前面拉，后面推，绳子不够长就用人连成“人索”，架起“人梯”，和悬岩陡坡搏斗着，用尽一切可以想到的办法，把炮运向前去。等到马匹又驮上武器弹药追上了突击部队的时候，连他们自己也大吃一惊，不知道自己是怎样连人带炮翻过山来的。
    顷刻之间——第一颗手榴弹打上山头，突击连的勇士们立即沸腾起来。映红了伟大祖国安东市的新义州的大火，从鸭绿江到汉江的千里废墟，在公路边扯着母亲血尸的朝鲜婴孩，死在美国兽兵尸体怀抱中的朝鲜少女——在进军的悲愤日子里所燃起的种种仇恨和誓愿，此刻都凝结成了一句最简单的战斗号召：“实现决心的时候到啦！”冲向敌人的勇士们互相鼓舞着。爆炸的浓烟刚刚弥漫山头，突击班已经冲到敌人身旁。双方的自动步枪正在猛烈对射，机枪射手已经绕到阵地后方，陡岩上找不到射击阵地，他们就抱起机枪当冲锋枪扫射。六零炮也赶上了手榴弹，小炮手就地踏开个雪窝，用脚蹬住炮盘，用手抓住炮筒当炮架，让炮口直冲着天，在不到七十公尺的短距离内猛打起来。
    这是短促而激烈的山头争夺战。突击连攻占了六座山头。连长、指导员和四个排长先后负伤了。前面还有六座高峰。同志的血不能白流。这个说：“我代理连长！”那个就说：“我带突击班。”新的突击组刚刚组织好，机枪组又收集了满袋的子弹。战士李才的肩头负了重伤，仍然坚决挣脱卫生员的手，一面冲一面说：“消灭了敌人再给我包扎。”直到他射倒了四个敌人，随身的子弹全打光以后，还拿着空枪捉了一个俘虏。脚背突然负伤的班长孙福堂，一栽头，又猛爬起来：“中国人怎的也不能向敌人低头！我爬上去也要消灭敌人！”他跛着脚冲上第六座山头。激战在鹤洞的最高峰沸腾。就在鲜血正从他脚上流出的时候，卡宾枪又在他手中嘶吼着，他冲进敌阵，一口气射倒了十几个敌人，而他脚下的血印就像一支胜利的箭头指向南方——缺口打开了。突击连以付出四十九个伤亡的代价，在两个钟头内毙伤敌人六十余，俘敌十余，但主要的是他们毕竟打开了一条进军的道路。
  尖刀猛插三十里
    当前沿争夺战开始爆发的时候，在相距不到七里的两颗“门牙”中间，又一支突击部队冲过了公路，插进了雪谷。
    他们前进得这样迅速，肃静得这样出奇，以致走在公路上的敌人搜索大队还只管抽着烟，哼着下流的歌曲，不知道自己的游动哨已经被插断过好几次。而走在行列尖端的志愿军某部第八班，当他们以突发的火力冲垮了拦路的敌人时，副班长王步祥拦腰抱住一个伪军，一把把他摔倒地上，忽然又松开双手，只踢他一脚，便追赶队伍去了。他想起自己的任务不是抓一个俘虏，而是抓住整师敌人。
    这是自报奋勇首先插进敌人心脏的“尖刀部队”第八班。他们在突击营的突击连里争到了突击任务，这就成了整个部队的“尖刀尖”。“迅速勇猛大胆穿插，不能中途卷了刀尖。”这是一个艰巨的光荣任务。早在中午敌人炮火集中轰击的时候，他们便在掩蔽部里乐着说：“杜鲁门啊杜鲁门，你没开戏就敲锣打鼓，怪热闹的，咱一出场，你又要唱哑巴戏了。”总攻击的信号刚刚升起，他们就躲过敌机的搜索，通过了二十里山地，开始从敌人的“牙缝”钻进深沟，把敌人吹嘘的“火力封锁带”扔在脑后了。
    可是，紧跟着第八班前进的突击连长张洪林，当时的心情却是特别紧张的。大荒沟夹在两大主峰之间，南北两端的沟口都和公路衔接，中间却横着一道七百公尺高的大山脊，仅有打柴小路可走，深沟底下连住在沟口的朝鲜向导也迷路了。伪八师的两个团，就在两侧大山丛中，眼前却是一片漆黑和死寂。他拿着指北针，掌握着整个部队的方向，只觉得阴冷的峰峦黑影如同潜伏着的怪兽那样。突然的激战随时可能在身旁爆发。冲垮阻击的敌人——凭着这样的志愿，战士们只要他喊一声“实现决心的时候到了！”那怕是刀山也要冲垮它的。可是决定的战斗还在后面，沿途多流一点血或耽搁一分钟，都要影响全局。当一个战士决心把生命献给祖国，投身朝鲜战场的时候，他多么希望自己能够多杀几个敌人，多打几个胜仗，为世界和平创造更多的功绩呢？突击连长感到手里握住的不是指北针，而是全连人的生命和荣誉，千头万绪的紧张心情，都贯注到一个决心上了：“迅速猛插，碰不上敌人只管前进，碰上敌人就边打边前进！”他一路上这样鼓动着。而冲在头里的尖刀班长周祥双，当他发现山庄上闪着烟头星火的时候，依然继续前进，直到几个敌人跑下来用朝鲜话向他打招呼时，他才喊一声“展开！”端在胸前的连发卡宾枪也同时猛扫起来，一口气射倒四个敌人，就势追上山头。猝不及防的敌人垮了下去，又反扑上来。射手刘树木已经抢到班长侧翼，他端着机枪迎头射倒四个敌人，尾追下去，又抓了四个俘虏。等到突击连的猛烈火力变成了零碎的搜索枪声时，后续部队已开始从山庄安全通过了。
    突击连就是这样迅速勇猛地前进着。陡岩上有的战士攀不动了，他们便说：“占领了山头，主力通过没问题，鼓把劲就是胜利。”路旁大山上盖下来狙击的火网，他们便说：“不怕侧射。咱上不去，敌人也下不来。前进就是胜利。”来路上爆发了混战的激烈枪炮声，他们便说：“后续部队一定能打过来。咱们的后路切不断，敌人断了后路就乱了。猛插就是胜利。”堵击的敌人被冲垮了，他们便说：“不抓俘虏不要枪，更大的胜利还在前头。抓住大头就有大胜利。”以第八班为“尖刀”的突击第七连，就是这样地成为一把锐不可当的尖刀，沿途打垮了四次阻击，在当晚九点三十分占领了广田台侧后由西向东的公路的沟口，打通了整个突击部队进入敌人心脏的道路。
    午夜十一时半，志愿军与李伪军第十团争夺主峰八零零高地的激战正在猛烈展开，而强攻李伪军第十六团七七三高地的战斗还未打响。这时公路上忽然出现了一溜几里长的汽车灯炬向东驰来。
    这是美军第二师重野炮营和李伪军第八师师部的汽车。远离车群的第一辆车冲过了沟口驰向广田台，显然敌人还以为这条深藏在两大主峰阵地侧后的公路，依然是远射程炮队的良好阵地。直到进至广田台的志愿军第八连将第一辆汽车击毁，所有火炬才突然熄灭，汽车停住了。
    但是马达声并未停止，相反地却轰然吼动起来。三辆重型坦克在头里，发射出密集的扇形火网向前滚动。汽车上和榴弹炮牵引车上的自动火器也向公路两侧猛烈扫射起来。
    敌人要突围，要冲向直通原州的南北公路。突击营的轻重机枪，抢占了沿着沟口的一溜小山。突击第七连先头冲向公路。尖刀第八班在前面插到路北的沟沿。经过了三次战役的勇士们，都以同样的美造自动火器，发射出更加猛烈的狙击火力。突击排的爆破手，就在双方交织的火网下扑向坦克，把房样高的第一辆坦克炸得不动了。
  英雄营长与英雄战士
    可是，突然间那辆不动的坦克又喷出火舌，嘶声震吼起来，猛然冲过了七连的火网，又冲过了八连的狙击阵地，拚命逃向公路交叉点。其余二辆也乘机逃脱了。
    后面汽车上的自动火器和轻型曲射火器，这时也拚命猛射起来。坦克上的榴弹炮朝着空气乱轰一顿。五里长的摩托行列如同一条浑身冒火的怪蛇，紧跟着那二辆坦克冲向广田台。这就是敌人吹嘘的“炮火优势”。必须打掉它这个“优势”。八连的共产党员于水林拿起反坦克炸弹就冲上公路，第二辆坦克却擦身滚压过来了。在这万分危险的顷刻间，他没有被滚动的齿轮卷倒，却就势扶着它，跟着跑了几步，借着炮弹射出的弹光，看准要害，顿时把重型坦克炸起大火，跟着又把同样的第二辆炸个重伤。满载着美国兵的一辆大卡车，也叫他用两颗手榴弹炸毁了。
    负伤的坦克冒着火还要向前挣扎，迎面又挨了一支火箭。——刚才还在大山里和雪路苦斗的志愿军炮兵，已经沿着公路架起美制火箭炮、反坦克炮和步兵炮，迎头痛击起来。挤成一堆的钢铁残骸，把一百四十多辆汽车、坦克堵死在公路上了。车上的敌人已经被拦腰突击的步兵打得满地乱滚了这是缴获战利品的好机会。突击营长李玉才却说：“大炮汽车反正跑不了，消灭了敌人就都是我们的。继续前进！”青年营长李玉才曾经以勇敢与机智的果断指挥，在战斗中荣获英雄称号。凭着三次战役的经验，他看着山头的簇簇弹光，就像看见了狡猾的敌人。他们避开夜战，分散躲在山中，等待天明，好让飞机掩护着重新集结作战。本来紧夹着公路岔口的广田台的南山、北山和碧鹤山，就是李伪军第八师二十一团和美军第二师第九团等部的阵地，加上从汽车上逃窜的敌人，这一带最少密集了三千名美李匪军。在这段不到三里长的公路沿线，一处处起伏错杂的大小高地，都有血火迸发。突击部队正处在敌人优势兵力的包围中。必须迅速打乱敌人！突击营立刻一个连一个排地组织成许多独立穿插的突击尖刀，分头向着枪声密集的山头打去。可是插向广田台南山的“尖刀”第七连，没等发起攻击，便被突然加强的火力压在公路边了。
    这是广田台一带的制高点。打不下南山，突击部队就难以展开兵力，从右翼迂回横城的兄弟部队就失却进军的屏障，坚决打下是不容迟疑的。可是“尖刀”第八班和突击排已经被三面火力制压在山麓的洼地上，抬不起头了。正是十二日清晨四点钟，亲自带领着第七连的英雄营长李玉才，面临着指挥员经常碰到的、也是最激烈紧张的战场考验。这是决心下达以前的紧张而又缜密的思考和突然出现的恶劣敌情在顷刻间所激起的强烈斗争。坚决打下，血没有白流。可是一个人民军队的指挥员，在战场上废寝忘食地日夜思虑的，不仅是为的打胜仗，而且是要打个伤亡很小、战果很大的漂亮仗。指挥员的责任心使他忘了子弹正在身边乱窜。他继续站在五二二公尺高的大山面前，凝视着七座山峰的黑影，审视着每一处疯狂喷射着的山头火力点。忽然他觉得爬在山上的是一群撅着屁股只管向公路拱着嘴巴的蠢猪。
    “从屁股后给他一脚！”他果断地决定着。战士们便以英雄的战斗实现了英雄营长的决心。射手廖元本陡然从洼地上直起身来，跪着端起轻机枪就和山头对射。尽管三面火网顿时转向着他，这个勇敢的青年团员依然不放松对面山头上打得最急的重机枪。在身旁乱窜的子弹越飞越高，他就像看见敌人把头缩回在机枪底下似的，索性站起身来猛打。枪筒打红了，他也舍不得松开被烙疼的手，一口气打了八百七十三发子弹，硬把敌人的一面火力制压下去。当突击排安全地撤离了敌人的火力封锁地带，迅速转移到广田台南山的西北角以后，经过了一整夜激战的勇士们，又一口气攀越过三座山峰，向着正在抽烟的敌人发起突然的攻击。他们从敌人屁股后面连夺四座顶峰阵地，前后只花了一个半钟头。而首先冲上最高峰的仍然是英雄的尖刀第八班。尽管这个英雄班只留下班长周祥双，射击手刘树木等四个人了，可是四支枪的突击火力还是这样猛烈，不等敌人回过头来，他们就把敌人的阵地打乱了。
  在敌人心脏围歼敌人
    南山攻击战正在顺利发展的时候，广田台北山的东南端爆发了连续两小时的一场恶战。
    这是楔入公路岔口的一条狭长的山腿子。从广田插到那里的二营五连的两个排，突然遭到了几十倍于己的敌人的反击。孙连纪和史玉保二勇士刚刚把冲到跟前的第一辆坦克击毁，公路岔口也被混战隔断。在坦克的熊熊大火中，一群群的敌兵在公路的沟沿时隐时现，朝东涌来。南北公路上满载敌兵的六十几辆汽车，正在向南急驰。路东碧鹤山上的敌人，也朝小山腿轰击、扫射起来。公路口成了三面敌人疯狂反击的焦点。
    五六连的勇士们在三面火网下，一时插过公路口，一时追到沟沿，从敌群中硬打过去，又兜头猛打回来，打得敌人四散逃跑。可是跑乱了的敌人并没有被消灭。他们猬集在南山陡岩下的山麓、公路干线的沟沿和东侧的高地上。当三十几架敌机突然在清晨出现的时候，反击的炮弹顿时把狭长的小山腿子打遍了。敌人要大举突围。成千的敌兵涌上汽车，一面开足马力逃命，一面拚命向南射击。掠过山头的敌机在头顶急得团团乱转。碧鹤山的曲射炮一股劲往烟火弥漫的小山腿猛轰。尽管满地爬着的美国伤兵向着车上的伙伴扬手求救，但急驰的汽车仍然舍不得放过这突围的好机会。突然间，炮烟里又喷射出顽强的弹光，是志愿军勇士们冲出来迎头阻击了。头一辆汽车顿时一头撞到沟沿，第二辆猛然撞上前车，也不动了。
    慌乱的敌人于是又滚下汽车，钻到沟里，重新集结起来，分两路夹着汽车行列往南冲，又被打垮了，又跑回去躲起来，又打炮射击，然后又上车，又冲。成千的美李匪军如此反复冲了四次，始终没能冲过公路岔口。反击的敌人越是来得多，迎击的战士越是打得猛。他们如此奋不顾身，在混战中往前猛冲猛插。一时收不回来。坚守着山头的只剩下连长李艺山和三个战士，他们依然充满信心。
    “反正兄弟部队马上就会打过来，剩下一个人也要把这路口卡住。”李连长说着就一把夺过通讯员的马枪，带着三个人一样打垮了一次汽车上敌人的反击。他腿部的动脉被打断了，还在阵地上坚持指挥。通讯员两次跑来抢枪，要他撤离火线，他两次都坚决拒绝，并且命令说：“你到前面去叫突击排长继续打。”他直到牺牲也不肯放下手中的马枪，表现了共产党员自我牺牲的崇高品质。正是这种为了全歼敌人而慷慨流血的顽强战斗，硬把敌人从北向南和从西向东的突围孔道堵住了两小时。直到两个突击排长董玉庆，谢金桂和十几个英雄战士壮烈牺牲后，在混战中失散了的机枪射手林荣寿仍然和五个战士自动组织起来，在公路岔上打来打去。两挺机枪被敌人打坏了，他又找了第三挺继续战斗。机枪子弹打完了，又拿起卡宾枪和自动步枪顽强射击。
    就在这个时候，全歼敌人的正义惩罚开始了：侧翼迂回的兄弟部队已经在南面的横城会师，正面攻击的兄弟部队开始在北面的大山出现。踞守圣智峰两大主峰的李伪军第八师第十团和十六团都漫山溃散下来了。仅仅是广田北面的城谷洼地里就挤满了一千多名美李匪军。
    溃散在山丛中的美李匪军还拚命地发着无线电报，摆起对空联络布板，向满天乱飞的敌机求救。可是正如志愿军勇士们说的：“你在天上团团转，我在地上照样干！”勇士们只管投入猛抓俘虏的穿插战斗。从大山插向城谷的某部三连的尤风林班，扫射着冲进雪谷，硬把继续抵抗的五百多人的敌群分成两半，然后返回头又从敌群中打回山顶。突击营九连的姜玉泉班以一个钟头的混战，迎头挡住几百敌人。当敌人完全丧失斗志，只顾四散逃跑的时候，勇士们又用追击的火力截住去路，一股劲在逃敌的身旁扫射着，像一条赶着羊群的鞭子似地把他们赶成一团，再把他们俘掳起来。正如在公路口壮烈阻击的英雄连队所坚信的，他们的血不会白流。仅仅六个钟头以后，兄弟部队便抓到了李伪军七千三百多名和美军五百五十余名。摆在广田横城一线的大批胜利品中，有五百六十七辆汽车，十四辆坦克，和五十七门榴弹炮。
