Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th. TASS dispatch: The "People's Daily" London correspondent, Mayevsky, interviewed the British Dean of Canterbury, Johnson, who was awarded the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Peoples." Johnson said: I deeply feel the honor given to me by the movement to defend peace, a movement which now represents more than half of the adults in the world, and which is closely linked at every moment with the great name of Stalin. I am very grateful for the recognition of my modest efforts for international peace over the past thirty years. From the time when Russia was isolated, I pointed out what the actual hopes of Russia were. Now the Soviet Union has become a powerful country, uniting the people of the world to defend peace. At a time when the whole world is facing the threat of war, the "Strengthening International Peace" Prize gives me new inspiration and makes me work harder for peace. Johnson emphasized that the British people hate the American aggressors' idea of advocating war against China and oppose the rearmament of West Germany. The British people's peace movement is growing. Johnson concluded: When dark clouds shroud the world, we hear Stalin's clear and understandable words, and we have the confidence that peace will prevail.

    斯大林国际奖金鼓舞他更加努力为和平工作
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：真理报驻伦敦记者马耶夫斯基访问了荣膺“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金的英国坎特伯雷副主教约翰逊。约翰逊谈称：我深切地感到保卫和平运动给予我的光荣，这个运动现在代表着全世界一半以上的成年人，并且时时刻刻与斯大林的英名密切地联系着。我非常感谢人们承认我三十年来为国际和平而尽的微劳。从俄国孤立的时代起，我便指出俄国的实际希望是什么。现在苏联已成为强大的国家，团结了世界人民保卫和平。在今天全世界面临着战争威胁的时候，“加强国际和平”奖金给我以新的鼓舞，使我更加努力来为和平工作。约翰逊强调指出英国人民憎恨美国侵略者鼓吹对中国作战的思想，并反对重新武装西德。英国人民的和平运动正日趋壮大。约翰逊最后说：当阴云笼罩全世界的时候，我们听到斯大林的明白易解的言语，就会产生了和平必胜的信心。
