North Korean Dispatch

　　Heaven and Earth
　　Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Shu Qun

　　One night, we hurried to Samdok District. It is said that this is one of North Korea's gold mining areas, now completely destroyed by the enemy. The waxing moon emitted a faint light, making it impossible to see anything clearly; everything was blurred. When we entered the house, we couldn't see anything at all. These days, we have become accustomed to living in Korean houses. We take off our shoes outside and enter directly onto the *ondol* (heated floor). Someone said, "The Korean *ondol* deserves praise," and that's right. With just a little firewood and a few fires, the *ondol* heats up. It's as quick and even as the enthusiasm with which the Korean people treat the Chinese People's Volunteers. No matter how cold the Korean winter is, the warmth of the Koreans and the heat of the *ondol* will surely keep you warm and cozy all night long. However, this time, as we stepped over the threshold, we felt particularly cold. We couldn't hear the sound of the host speaking. The *ondol* was ice-cold. We thought: maybe the village had been bombed, or maybe there were too many refugees. Whatever the case, there must be difficulties. The person in charge then led us to this empty house. We shone a flashlight and saw three small heads peeking out from a tattered quilt on the *ondol* in the next room (actually, just a window-like partition). Their faces were thin and pale. If one of the children hadn't occasionally whimpered softly, we might have mistaken them for three little corpses. Right now, there are indeed many orphans in North Korea. There were four in the place where our correspondent was staying. Fortunately, they still had a mother. When we were eating there, some of us ate less, and some even went hungry, sharing our food with the children and donating money to the mother. The older child took the bowl of rice, but before she could eat it, she stopped and fed the rice to the sleeping little mouth. That loving and stubborn Korean mother resolutely refused to accept the money. She meant that our journey was long and we needed money everywhere. She patted her chest, indicating that she had the confidence and strength to raise the children to adulthood. Unfortunately, we couldn't communicate our thoughts and feelings well due to the language barrier. Living under enemy air raids every day, we only understood that she called the planes "byeon-gi" (plane), and with her gestures and a "boom" sound, we understood that she was saying that the enemy plane bombings had killed her husband and others, leaving her with four children and adding several more orphans to North Korea. The "byeon-gi" and gestures, plus the "boom" sound, not only could the mother say and gesture, but the children could also say and gesture; not only do we Chinese people understand, but people all over the world also understand; not only are we Chinese people sympathizing, but people all over the world are sympathizing!

　　We often hear American war merchants talking about "devastating bombings." Now we see them "bombing the map" aimlessly. The entire map of North Korea is their bombing target. They can shatter the rocks on the mountains, they can scatter the branches and leaves of the forests, they can collapse the houses, they can wound and kill people; but "devastating bombings" will never destroy the orphans. Everyone knows that childhood memories are particularly strong, and the orphans will forever remember the hatred of the American murderers. "Devastating bombings" will ultimately not affect the victory of the armed brothers of the Chinese and North Korean people.

　　People who have seen American prisoners of war all say that when asked "Why did you come to Korea?" there are all sorts of answers. One answer is "to travel," so they "traveled" to Korea, and then "traveled" from the ground to the sky. But there will always be a day when they can't stand their ground at all. Absurd American pilots and gunners, don't think that if you can't stand on the ground, you can still stay in the sky. In the vast sky, you can't grow wheat to give them bread to eat, you can't grow cotton to give them clothes to wear, and there are no coffee shops, bars, or dance halls for them to play in. In short, people can't live in the sky.

　　On January 26, an incident occurred near Songseok Village. An American plane crashed into a mountain and fell. One of the two people in the plane was killed. The surviving guy wanted to escape. But this is the ground, not as casual as the sky, where you can do whatever you want. This surviving guy was caught by our driver comrade and sent to our military organization. The first thing he said was, "Are you going to execute me?" The most profound impression he gave us was "fear." We treated his injuries, but he refused, fearing that the medicine was poisonous. We gave him food to eat, but he wanted someone else to taste it first, fearing that the food was poisonous. When he was sent to the prisoner-of-war camp, he collapsed, fearing that he would be sent to the execution ground. He sat in the car, unable to sit still, his eyes constantly looking at the sky, his ears constantly listening for sounds. He was afraid that his comrades would bomb him. Yesterday, he was a great robber who killed and set fires; today, he is a ridiculous clown.

　　We all know that "fear" is one of the characteristics of American prisoners of war. Of course, not all American prisoners of war are pilots and gunners. And not all American air force prisoners of war were captured because they crashed into mountains. Most of them were shot down by our anti-aircraft weapons. There are also some who were shot down by the soldiers with rifles. For example, in Yuegu Village, a small unit of Chinese People's Volunteers was passing through and was harassed by four enemy planes. The enemy planes, with their wings askew, flew close to the ground, dropping bombs and firing machine guns. A Chinese People's Volunteer soldier became impatient and raised his gun and fired two shots at it; two shots brought down one plane. Another example: the anti-aircraft battle unfolded at the ×× anti-aircraft artillery position was as follows: At a little after 10 a.m. on February 1, four Mustang enemy planes flew over. The enemy knew that this was an anti-aircraft artillery position (because the sky was blocked by a network of fire, many enemy planes had fallen here), so they dared not fly low. Flying high and dropping bombs was inaccurate. It could be clearly seen that the pilots of the enemy planes had already shown the characteristics of prisoners of war before they were captured – "fear." As soon as they flew down low, our fierce artillery fire immediately drove them back up. They spun countless times, came back countless times, but it was all in vain. One enemy plane was hit by our anti-aircraft artillery. It nosedived, its tail emitting smoke and fire, and it fell straight down. Just now, the people in the villages within twenty *li* were still in hiding. This time, it was more lively than a festival. The Korean people ignored the other three enemy planes overhead and ran out, looking up at the sky and shouting, "Well done!" "People are jumping out!" At this time, two white balls fell out of the smoke and fire. The white balls opened, becoming two parachutes, with a pair of fleeing ghosts dangling below. The Korean people immediately became busy, regardless of men or women, old or young. Those with knives took knives, those with sticks took sticks, those with ropes took ropes, those with electric wires took electric wires, regardless of the distance, regardless of the height of the mountains, regardless of the depth of the river, rushing straight towards the direction in which the parachutes were falling. They ran faster than wild horses and arrived in one breath. One of the two murderers escaped. However, it wasn't long before he was found by the people in the woods. This pair of murderers were wearing the same large leather hats, the same canvas overalls, and the same large rubber shoes. However, one was older and one was younger. The older one sat on his parachute after landing, very obediently, without moving at all. He could only laugh, laughing incessantly. He closed his mouth, stared blankly, and the flesh on his face did not stretch or shrink, as if it were a sculpted smiling face, always the same. Some people say this is called a "soul-lost laugh," and that's probably right. The younger one always kept his head down, like a freak without a front neck. These two monsters attracted four or five hundred people to this desolate hillside. They weren't just standing around, watching a puppet show for fun. Their hearts were agitated, and their eyes flashed with the fire of revenge. Their mouths shouted words of revenge: "Hit them, beat these two guys to death!" But they were stopped by the staff. Can we blame the Korean people, can we say they have no manners? No! We have personally seen how much property of the Korean people has been lost in their hands, how many houses of the Korean people have collapsed in their hands, and how many lives of the Korean people have been lost in their hands. Let them raise their heads and open their eyes to see, standing before them are so many widows, so many orphans, so many old people without descendants. This group of men, women, old and young are all shouting, "Give me back my people!" This pair of murderers didn't understand Korean. Someone translated it into English for them, but they pretended not to understand. The younger one never raised his head. The older one lowered his head again. Yes, they are not only sorry to the Korean people, they can't bear to see the Korean people, but they are also sorry to every blade of grass and tree in Korea, and they can't bear to see every blade of grass and tree in Korea. They lowered their heads and were escorted by our armed comrades to the prisoner-of-war camp. When seven enemy planes flew over to look for them, no one was found. Only the wreckage of the plane by the river a *li* away was found by them. The number of that Mustang plane was clearly visible – number one eight nine. A Chinese People's Volunteer soldier said, "Go back and tell that old MacArthur, just say it's sleeping (smashed)." However, war merchants do not listen to good advice and still send groups and groups of enemy planes. On the same afternoon, another one "fell asleep," and two more "fell asleep" the next day.

　　I've written so much, but I haven't written enough about the anti-aircraft gunners of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Because we are on the road, we don't have time to visit them. Let's call them the comrades of Liu Yuanchuan (the glorious figure who was named "Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" for his anti-aircraft artillery defense). Let us repeat: "Salute to the anti-aircraft heroes!"

　　Along the way, we constantly heard the sound of "boom." Every time we heard a sound, we couldn't help but think about how many fewer people there were in Korea, and how many more orphans were added...

　　At the same time, we also saw that before and after the enemy planes "boom," they fell down one by one, and more and more every day. For the liberation and happiness of Korea, and the safety and construction of our motherland, let the combined fire network of the ground and the sky wipe out the enemy in one fell swoop!

　　天上地下
    本报特约记者  舒群
    一天夜里，我们赶到三德区。据说，这是朝鲜的金矿区之一，现在已被敌人破坏无余了。上弦月，发着微弱的光，也看不清什么，一切都模模糊糊。当我们走进屋子的时候，连什么也看不见了。这些日子，我们在朝鲜的屋里住惯了，鞋脱在外头，进门就是炕。有人说“朝鲜的炕值得表扬”，这是对的。只用一点柴，烧几把火，炕就热了。有如朝鲜人民招待中国人民志愿军的热情似地热得那么快，又那么匀。随便朝鲜的冬天多么冷，朝鲜人热和炕热，准让你暖暖烘烘地过了夜。可是，这次我们迈进门槛，都感觉特别冷。听不见主人说话的声音。炕又是冰凉的。我们想：大概村子被炸了，或者难民来多了。不管怎么的，反正有困难吧。负责人才把我们送到这间空房子里来。我们拿电筒照了照，在隔壁（实际只是一层窗子似的隔扇）的炕上，破被套里露着三个小脑袋，脸瘦、又惨白，如果没有一个孩子偶然轻轻地哼哼两声，难免误认为这是三个小尸首。现在，朝鲜的孤儿们实在不少，我们通讯员借宿的地方，就有四个。所幸的是她们还有一个妈妈。当我们在那里吃饭的时候，我们有的人少吃了些，有的人竟是饿了一顿，把饭菜分给孩子，还捐钱给母亲。大孩子接过饭碗，刚张嘴想吃，又没吃；她把饭送到那个睡觉的小嘴里去。那慈爱的倔强的朝鲜母亲，坚决不收钱。她的意思是我们的路远，到处需要钱。她拍拍胸，表示有自信、有力量把孩子们养大成人。可惜，语言不通，没法很好地交流彼此的思想情感。每天在敌机空袭下生活，我们只懂得她把飞机叫“边机”，再加上她的手势，和“轰”的一声，我们明白她这是说，敌机轰炸的结果，把她的丈夫等人炸死了，只给她留下四个孩子，给朝鲜又增加了几个孤儿。“边机”和手势，再加上“轰”声，不仅母亲会说会比划，孩子们也会说会比划；不仅我们中国人能懂，全世界人民也都会懂；不仅我们中国人民在同情，全世界人民都在同情啊！
    我们常听美国战争贩子说“毁灭性的轰炸”。现在我们看见他们无目标地“炸地图”。整个朝鲜的地图，都是他们轰炸的目标。他们可以把山上的石头炸裂，可以把树林的枝叶炸得纷飞，可以把房子炸塌，可以把人炸伤、炸死；但“毁灭性的轰炸”，终归毁灭不了孤儿们。谁都知道，童年的记忆力特别强，孤儿们将永远记得美国杀人犯的仇恨。“毁灭性的轰炸”，终归影响不了中朝人民武装弟兄的胜利。
    见过美国俘虏的人们都说，问他们“为什么到朝鲜来的？”有各式各样的回答。其中有一种回答是“好游”，所以“游”到朝鲜，又从地下“游”到天上。但是，总会有那么一天，他们会完全站不住脚的。荒唐的美国驾驶员和射击手，别以为地下站不住脚，天上还能停留。在大空之中，既种不出麦子给他们面包吃，又种不出棉花给他们衣服穿，更没咖啡店、酒吧间、跳舞厅给他们玩耍。总之，天上是活不了人的。
    一月二十六日，在松石村附近发生了一件事，有一架美国飞机碰到山上，掉下来了。飞机中的两个人，碰死了一个。活着的这个家伙，想逃跑。但这是地下，不像天上那么随便，可以为所欲为。这个活着的家伙被我们的司机同志捉住了，把他送到我们的军事机关。他说的第一句话就是：“你们枪毙我不？”他给我们最深刻的一个印象，就是“怕”。我们给他治伤，他不肯，怕药是有毒的。给他饭吃，他要别人先尝过，怕饭是有毒的。送他上俘虏营时，他就瘫了，怕被送到刑场去。他坐在车上，坐也坐不稳，眼睛一直看天空，耳朵一直听声音，他怕他的伙伴炸了他。昨天，他还是杀人放火的大盗，今天就是可笑的小丑了。
    我们都知道“怕”是美国俘虏的特点之一。当然，所有的美国俘虏并不完全是飞机驾驶员和射击手。美国空军俘虏，也并不完全是因碰山而被俘的。其中的大多数，是被我们的高射武器打下来的。也有一些，是被战士们用步枪打下来的。例如，在月古村，有志愿军一个小部队经过，被四架敌机骚扰。敌机歪着翅膊，贴着地皮飞来飞去扔炸弹、打机关炮。一个志愿军战士不耐烦了，举起枪给它两枪；两枪就打下来一架。又例如：在××高射炮阵地展开的防空战，经过情形如下：二月一日上午十点多钟，飞来四架野马式敌机。敌人知道这是高射炮阵地（因为天空火网的封锁，这里掉下过好多架敌机了），不敢低飞。高飞又投弹不准。可以看得清楚，敌机的驾驶员还没有被俘，已经表现了俘虏的特点——“怕”。他们刚低飞下来，我们一阵猛烈的炮火，立刻把它们打上去。旋了无数圈，重来无数次，结果还是白扯。有一架敌机，被我们的高射炮打中了。它把头一栽，屁股放出一股烟火，一个劲地往下掉。刚才，二十里内的村子的人们还在隐蔽，这一下子，比过节还热闹，朝鲜老百姓也不管头上其余的三架敌机，都跑出来，仰着脸看，嘴里喊道：“打的好！”“人跳出来啦！”这时，有两个白球从烟火里掉出来。白球张开，成了两把伞，伞下坠着一对逃命鬼。朝鲜老百姓立刻都忙起来，不管男女，不管老少，有刀子的拿刀子，有棒子的拿棒子，有绳子的拿绳子。有电线的拿电线，不管路远近，不管山高低，不管河深浅，一直向降落伞降落的方向冲去。他们比野马跑的还快，一口气就跑到了。两个杀人犯，逃了一个。可是，没有多久，就被人民从树林子里搜出来了。这一对杀人犯，都戴一样的大皮帽子，穿一样的帆布套衣，一样的大胶皮鞋。不过有一个年老些的，一个年青些的。年老些的，着地后，一直坐在他的伞上，很守规矩，一动也不动。他只会笑，一个劲地笑。他闭着嘴，楞着眼睛，脸上的皮肉，也不伸不缩，好像是塑成的笑脸，老是一个样子。有人说这叫“失魂笑”，大概是对的。那个年青些的，总是低着头，好像没前脖颈的怪胎似的。这两个怪物，在这荒凉的山坡下，引来四五百人。他们不是闲着没事，来看木偶戏取乐的。他们的心激动着，他们的眼睛冒着复仇的火。他们的嘴喊着复仇的话：“打呀，打死这两个家伙！”但是，他们被工作人员拦住了。我们能责备朝鲜人民、能说他们没有教养吗？不能！我们亲眼看见多少朝鲜人民的财物损失在他们的手里，多少朝鲜人民的家屋倒在他们的手里，多少朝鲜人民的生命丧在他们的手里。让他们抬起头来，睁开眼睛看看吧，他们眼前站着那么多的寡妇，那么多的孤儿，那么多的绝后的老人。这群男女老小都在喊：“给我的人偿命呵！”这一对凶手不懂得朝鲜话，有人用英文给他们翻译出来，他们还装不懂。那个年青些的一直没抬头。年老的又把头低下。是的，他们不仅对不起朝鲜人，见不得朝鲜人，而且对不起朝鲜的一草一木，也见不得朝鲜的一草一木。他们低着头，被我们的武装同志押着往俘虏营走。当七架敌机飞来寻找他们的时候，什么人也没发现，只有一里外河边上的那一架机骸，被它们发现了，那架野马式飞机的编号是清清楚楚的——一八九号。有个中国人民志愿军的战士说：“回去告诉麦克阿瑟那老小子吧，就说它睡（碎）着了。”但是，战争贩子是不听忠告的，还是派一群一群的敌机来。就在当天下午，又“睡着”了一架，第二天又“睡着”了两架。
    写了这么多，却没有写到应该更多写的中国人民志愿军的高射炮手。因为我们正在赶路，没有时间去访问他们。现在姑且称之为刘源川（以高射炮防空有功而被称为“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄”的光荣人物）的同伴吧。让我们重复一句：“向防空英雄们致敬！”
    一路上我们不断地听到“轰”的声音。每听一声，不由得想到朝鲜又少了多少人，又添了多少孤儿……
    同时，我们也看到，敌机在“轰”的前后，一架一架地掉下来，而且一天比一天多。为了朝鲜的解放和幸福、祖国的安全和建设，让地下天上的联合火网，把敌人一网打尽！
