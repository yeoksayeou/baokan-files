    Self-Criticism Regarding Incorrectly Printed Flags of Peaceful and Democratic Nations

To the Editors:

    The criticism made by Comrade Li Ben Zhao in your newspaper on March 25th regarding our incorrectly printed flags of peaceful and democratic nations is entirely correct. The flags we published were based on the "World Political Situation Map" published by World Knowledge Press in August 1950. Some of the images were incorrect; World Knowledge Press corrected them in the October reprint last year, but because we did not have the reprinted map at the time, we printed them incorrectly. After discovering this error, we corrected it in the 46th issue and printed the correct versions in the 47th issue.

    This error demonstrates that our work suffers from a careless style. We will definitely work hard to improve in the future.

### 天津新儿童社  对印错和平民主国家国旗的检讨

　　天津新儿童社
    对印错和平民主国家国旗的检讨编辑同志：
    贵报三月二十五日刊登李本昭同志对我们印错和平民主国家的国旗的批评，是完全正确的。我们登载的这些国旗，是根据世界知识社一九五○年八月出版的《世界政治形势图》制版的。其中有些图是错的，世界知识社在去年十月再版时已经更正，但我们因当时没有再版的地图，所以错印了。发觉这个错误以后，我们已于四十六期更正，并在四十七期中把正确的印上了。
    这个错误，说明了我们工作中存在着粗枝大叶的作风，今后一定努力改进。
