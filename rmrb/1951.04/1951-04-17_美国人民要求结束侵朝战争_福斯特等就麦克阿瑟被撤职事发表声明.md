　　American People Demand an End to the War of Aggression Against Korea
    Foster and Others Issue Statements on MacArthur's Dismissal

    [Xinhua News Agency, 16th] Leaders of progressive forces in the United States, commenting on MacArthur's dismissal, pointed out that this was a victory for the peace camp. They also pointed out that the Truman government's aggressive policy had not changed. They demanded an end to the war of aggression against Korea, the withdrawal of American troops, and a change in American foreign policy.

    According to a dispatch from Telecommunications Agency in New York on the 13th: William Z. Foster, Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, issued a statement. The statement, after pointing out that the protests of people around the world had a great effect on MacArthur's dismissal, said: "The Truman government is not establishing world peace by dismissing MacArthur, but is further intensifying the movement to militarize the United States, Britain, France, and Germany. ... Peace forces should now more urgently than ever demand a democratic peace to end the Korean War. They should also vigorously demand that the four major powers currently negotiating in Paris open the door to a genuine easing of the current dangerous world tension."

    Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States, said in his commentary on MacArthur's dismissal: "The American people deeply hope to avoid a world war. They are now not only trying to suppress and restrain those who more openly and actively advocate launching preemptive wars, but are also increasingly opposing the bipartisan war policies of Truman and Dulles."

    William B. Bross Lloyd Jr., Chairman of the Progressive Party of America, and Paul Robeson, Secretary, issued a statement saying: "The dismissal of MacArthur is a major victory for the forces of peace in the United States and around the world. The American people want not only to replace a general, but also to end the tragic Korean War. ... We demand peace first—no war in Asia, no rearmament of Europe."

    The American Peace Crusade organization telegraphed Truman saying: "We ask you to heed the hopes of millions of Americans, immediately initiate negotiations for a peaceful resolution of the Korean problem, and withdraw American troops. We also ask you to instruct Ambassador Jessup to reach an effective agreement with the Soviet Union and other countries at the Paris Foreign Minister's Assistants meeting in order to establish long-term peaceful relations on a world scale."

    The New York Labor Peace Conference also telegraphed Truman, demanding an end to the Korean War, the withdrawal of American troops, and the convening of a five-power conference to resolve all international disputes.

　　美国人民要求结束侵朝战争
    福斯特等就麦克阿瑟被撤职事发表声明
    【新华社十六日讯】美国进步力量的领袖在评论麦克阿瑟的下台时指出，这是和平阵营的胜利，他们同时指出，杜鲁门政府的侵略政策并未改变，他们要求结束对朝鲜的侵略战争，撤回美国军队，并改变美国的外交政策。
    据电通社纽约十三日消息：美国共产党主席福斯特发表一项声明。声明在指出全世界人民的抗议对于麦克阿瑟的撤职有极大作用之后说道：“杜鲁门政府不是以麦克阿瑟的撤职来建立世界和平，而是更加加紧使美、英、法、德军事化的运动。……和平力量现在应该较以往更为加紧地要求以民主的和平结束朝鲜战争。他们并应有力地要求目前正在巴黎举行谈判的四大国，为真正缓和目前世界危险的紧张局势打开大门。”
    美国共产党总书记但尼斯在评论麦克阿瑟被撤职时说道：“美国人民深深希望避免世界大战。他们现在不仅在努力抑压和束缚那些更公开更积极主张进行先发制人的战争的人，而且正在越来越甚地反对杜鲁门——杜勒斯的两党战争政策。”
    美国进步党主席宾逊及书记鲍尔温发表的声明说：“撤换麦克阿瑟乃是美国及全世界和平力量的重大胜利。美国人民不仅要撤换一位将军，而且要停止可悲的朝鲜战争。……我们要求和平第一—既不要亚洲战争，也不要重新武装欧洲。”
    美国和平十字军组织致电杜鲁门说：“我们要求你重视千百万美国人民的希望，立即倡议谈判和平解决朝鲜问题，并撤退美国军队。我们并要求你训令耶塞普大使在巴黎外长助理会议上与苏联及其他国家获致有效的协议，以便建立世界规模的长期和平关系。”
    纽约劳工和平会议也致电杜鲁门，要求结束朝鲜战争、撤退美国军队并召开五大国会议，以解决一切国际争端。
