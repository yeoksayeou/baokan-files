In the recent years of the Great Production Movement, various regions in the Northeast have universally convened labor model conferences at the village, district, county, and even provincial levels. These meetings facilitated the exchange and summarization of production experiences and the arrangement of the next steps in production plans. After these meetings, the labor models conducted publicity and mobilization among the broad masses of farmers, enhancing their enthusiasm for production.

The current situation requires us to both resist America and aid Korea, consolidating national defense, and to increase production and develop the economy. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to better utilize the role of each labor model, transforming the Government Administration Council's decisions regarding agricultural and forestry production into concrete actions by the broad masses of farmers, launching a patriotic bumper harvest competition, and striving for a full regional harvest in 1951. Here, we offer some preliminary suggestions for local areas to consider.

  Strengthen Ideological Education and Continuously Improve the Political Consciousness of Labor Models

We must conduct ideological education for labor models, so that they not only achieve results in agricultural production, but can also continuously improve their political consciousness. Local leading organs should regularly educate labor models, enabling them to respect leadership, connect with the masses, and organize and lead the masses to advance together; not to exaggerate achievements, nor to conceal shortcomings; to study diligently and make constant progress. If the leading organs do not pay attention to educating them, or only praise their advantages without criticizing their shortcomings, some labor models easily become arrogant, detached from the masses, and cause losses in production. Last spring, after Heilongjiang Province's special-class labor model Wang Zhongyou was rewarded, due to his arrogance, laziness, and detachment from the masses, and because the provincial and county agricultural leading organs failed to educate him in a timely manner, the mutual aid team led by Wang Zhongyou almost collapsed. Some labor models thought that they had been to the province, county, or even Beijing, shook hands with Chairman Mao, and ate at the same table with him; therefore, they looked down on village cadres and local governments. Some labor models even flaunted their power to the masses and suppressed them. For example, when Liaoxi Province convened a labor model conference this year, more than two-thirds of the past provincial labor models were not selected. In Zhaoyuan County, of the twenty-odd provincial labor models selected in 1949, only two were elected as provincial labor models last year. Such situations have occurred, more or less, in various regions. After these situations occurred, the local relevant leading organs conducted corrections, and deeply criticized and educated some labor models' arrogance and complacency. However, the lessons of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoxi provinces tell us that it is not enough to only criticize and educate after problems occur; we must constantly pay attention to conducting specific leadership, education, and cultivation of labor models, so that they can continuously improve and play a good leading and backbone role among the masses.

  Labor Models Should Not Be Used as Cadres

The reason why farmers can be selected as labor models is because they are good at production. If being selected as a labor model leads to detachment from production, then what kind of "labor model" is that?! However, the leadership has often overlooked this point in the past. For example, Liaoxi Province's labor model Wang Zhengnian, the district and village leadership did not cultivate him in production, but only asked him to help with the village's regulation of cotton and hemp seeds, mobilize the masses to repair dikes, and lead the masses to send rice to the dikes, which delayed his work on improving technology. Jilin Province's first-class labor model Sun Shaoyan, because the leadership often went to him to create typical examples, outsiders also often visited, and in addition to frequent meetings, he delayed ninety workdays last year, and spent two dan and seven dou of grain to make up for work and pay for meeting expenses. The mutual aid team members also made up thirty-six workdays for him. Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, XinSheng village labor model Fu Dechang, because outsiders often went to find him, caused dissatisfaction among the masses, who said, "You are a 'labor model,' and we have to follow you and be 'troubled by meetings.'" The emergence of these deviations has made some of the masses reluctant to become labor models because they are afraid of delaying work due to meetings and fear of taking the lead in everything. This is indeed a major obstacle to improving agricultural production and consolidating and developing mutual aid teams, and should attract the attention of leading organs in various regions.

  Help Labor Models Improve Production According to Specific Circumstances

In the past, specific assistance to labor models in production in some individual areas was very insufficient. Some areas did not help labor models formulate production plans and conduct regular inspections to summarize experiences and lessons; instead, they excessively demanded that labor models take the lead everywhere and be models in everything, increasing the burden on labor models and putting them in a dilemma. For example, when experimenting with and promoting new-style agricultural tools last year, some areas blindly forced labor models to take the lead. When Jilin Province promoted the high-ridge soil-cultivating plow last year, a certain leading organ forced Zhu Baoxing to take the lead (because he could blacksmith and loved to study new agricultural tools). As a result, not only did he delay more than a month of work, but also because the high-ridge soil-cultivating plow was not easy to use, it caused dissatisfaction and blame from the masses, and reduced his prestige among the masses. Yushu County's provincial labor model Liu Bingli reflected: "In the past year, governments at all levels (including reporters, there were twenty-one units) came to visit, and there was not a ten-day period without a guest." The village cadres also thought that the model team was under the leadership of the higher authorities, and thus abandoned specific leadership and cultivation of the labor models. On the contrary, wherever the leading organs provided various specific assistance to the labor models according to specific circumstances and needs, the effect on production was very great. Last year, the Northeast Agricultural and Forestry Department loaned Wang Zhentang's mutual aid team two sets of Soviet-made agricultural implements, and provided technical guidance, which not only enabled the team to expand its cultivated area - reclaiming ninety-seven hectares of wasteland - but also produced more than eight hundred dan of grain than in 1949.

  Leadership Education for Labor Models Must Be Regular

The agricultural leading organs must regard the leadership, education, and cultivation of labor models as one of the regular tasks of leading agricultural production. If it is regarded as a shock campaign, and not regularly and promptly cultivated in production, it will not produce good results.

In the past, some areas did not pay regular attention to the cultivation of labor models, so they only rushed to elect them when it was time to hold labor model conferences, or even selected them in isolation from production. Such elections are prone to deviations. Wang Shouzhi, a fake labor model in Niqiaogouzi Village, Fate District, Shulan County, was not discovered until the county party committee working group inspected spring plowing last year. Zhangwu Guan Fengge, relying entirely on his ability to speak well, was a "fake labor model" for three years. There are also some areas that do not pay attention to and lead newly emerging labor models. For example, Zhao Kexian in Sidao Jianchang Village, Nanshanchengzi District, Qingyuan, harvested more grain than anyone else in the village, and had a lot of experience in improving technology and increasing grain production. The masses in the village all learned from him. Although the village cadres knew that his production was good, they did not cultivate him. On the contrary, they regarded the village's deputy chief Pang Guoxing as a labor model (in fact, he was inferior to Zhao Kexian in every aspect of production). This shows how serious the bureaucratic style of work was in the past in some places in the work of cultivating labor models. Therefore, in the future, agricultural leading organs must go deep into the masses and into the production movement to regularly discover and cultivate various models (as long as there is an achievement or a skill, it should be commended). Overcome and correct the past tendency of only looking at materials, not going deep into the masses, detaching from production, and selecting labor models in isolation.

### 关于农业劳动模范的培养问题

　　关于农业劳动模范的培养问题
    在最近几年的大生产运动中，东北区各地都普遍地召开了村、区、县以至全省的劳动模范大会。在这些会议中交流与总结了生产经验，布置了下一步的生产计划。这些劳动模范在会后向广大农民进行宣传与鼓动，提高了广大农民群众的生产积极性。
    目前的形势是一方面要抗美援朝，巩固国防；一方面要提高生产，发展经济。在这种情况下，必须更好地发挥每个劳动模范的作用，把政务院关于农林生产的决定，变成广大农民的具体行动，掀起爱国主义的丰产竞赛，争取一九五一年全区大丰收。在这里，我们提出几点初步意见，以供各地参考。
  加强思想教育，不断地提高劳动模范的政治觉悟
    对劳动模范进行思想教育，使他们不仅在农业生产上有成绩，并能继续不断地提高自己的政治觉悟。各地领导机关应该经常教育劳动模范，使他们能够很好地尊重领导，联系群众，组织与带领群众共同前进；不夸大成绩，不隐瞒缺点；努力学习，不断进步。如果领导机关不注意对他们进行教育，或只表扬优点不批评缺点，有些劳动模范就容易自高自大，脱离群众，使生产受到损失。去年春天，黑龙江省特等劳动模范王忠有受奖后，由于他骄傲、懒散、脱离群众，省、县农业领导机关又未能对他及时加以教育，王忠有领导的互助组几乎垮了台。有的劳动模范，以为自己到过省、县、甚至到过北京，和毛主席握过手、在一张桌子上吃过饭；因而就瞧不起村干部和地方政府。有的劳动模范甚至向群众抖威风，压制群众。如辽西省今年召开劳动模范大会时，过去的省劳动模范就有三分之二以上没有被选上。肇源县一九四九年选出的二十几个省劳动模范，去年当选省劳动模范的，只有两个人。像这些情况，各地或多或少都发生过。此种情况发生后，当地有关领导机关虽都进行了纠正，对某些劳动模范的骄傲自满情绪，进行了深刻的批评和教育。但黑龙江、吉林、辽西等省的教训告诉我们：仅仅在问题发生后才进行批评和教育是不够的，必须经常地注意对劳动模范进行具体的领导教育与培养，才能使他们不断的提高，很好地在群众中起带头与骨干作用。
  不能把劳动模范当干部使用
    农民所以能被选为劳动模范，就是因为他们的生产搞得好，如果被选为劳动模范就会因而脱离生产，那还成为什么“劳动模范”呢？！但领导上过去往往忽视了这一点。如辽西省劳动模范王正年，区、村领导上不对他在生产上加以培养，只是叫他帮助村内调剂棉麻种籽、发动群众修堤、带领群众往堤上送米等，以致耽误了他的改进技术工作。吉林省一等劳动模范孙绍岩，由于领导上经常去找他搞典型，外人也常常去访问，再加上常开会，去年一年就耽误了九十个工，自己一共花掉两石七斗粮食来补工和做开会用的盘费。互助组组员还替他补了三十六个工。松江省双城县新生村劳动模范傅德昌，因为外面经常有人去找他，引起群众对他不满，都说：“你当‘劳动模范’，我们还得跟着你当‘开会麻烦’。”由于这些偏差的产生，使部分群众因为怕开会误工、怕事事带头，而不愿当劳动模范。这确是提高农业生产，巩固与发展互助组的一大障碍，应该引起各地领导机关的注意。
  根据具体情况帮助劳动模范提高生产
    过去个别地区对劳动模范在生产上的具体帮助，是很不够的。有的地区不帮助劳动模范订立生产计划，并按期检查，总结经验教训；只是过高地要求劳动模范处处带头、事事模范，给劳动模范增加负担，使他们两头为难。如去年实验推广新式农具时，有的地区盲目地硬使劳动模范带头。吉林省去年推广高作培土犁时，某领导机关硬叫朱宝兴带头（因为他会打铁，也爱钻研新农具），结果不但他自己耽误了一个多月工，同时因为高作培土犁不好使，还引起了群众对他的不满和责备，降低了他在群众中的威信。榆树县省劳动模范刘秉礼反映：“在去年一年里，各级政府（包括记者有二十一个单位）都来访问，没有隔过十天不来客人。”村干部也认为模范组是上级领导的，以致放弃了对劳动模范的具体领导与培养。相反的，凡是领导机关根据具体情况和需要，对劳动模范进行各种具体帮助，对生产上起的作用就很大。去年东北农林部贷给王振堂互助组两套苏联马拉农具，并在技术上给予指导，不仅使该组扩大了耕地面积——开荒九十七垧，还比一九四九年多打八百多石粮食。
  对劳动模范的领导教育必须经常
    农业领导机关必须把对劳动模范的领导、教育与培养，当成领导农业生产的经常工作之一。如果把它当作一种突击工作，而不经常及时地在生产中加以培养，就不会产生好的效果。
    过去有些地区，由于领导上没有经常地注意对劳动模范的培养，直到临开劳动模范大会时才去突击选举，甚至脱离生产孤立地评选。这样的评选就容易有偏差。舒兰县法特区泥桥沟子村，有名无实的假劳动模范王守治，直至去年县委工作组检查春耕时才被发现。彰武关凤阁，全凭能说会道，当了三年“假劳动模范”。还有的地区，对新起的劳动模范不予以重视与领导。如清原南山城子区四道碱场村赵克先，全村数他打粮打的多，对改良技术、增产粮食，都很有经验，全村的群众也都向他学习。村干部虽然知道他生产好，但对他不加培养，相反地倒把该村的副村长庞国兴当成了个劳动模范（其实他在生产上处处不如赵克先）。这说明有些地方过去在培养劳动模范工作上，存在着怎样严重的官僚主义作风。因此，今后农业领导机关必须深入到群众中和生产运动里去，经常发现与培养各种模范（只要是有一事之成或一技之长，就应该表扬）。克服和纠正过去那种只看材料，不深入群众，脱离生产，孤立评选劳动模范的偏向。
