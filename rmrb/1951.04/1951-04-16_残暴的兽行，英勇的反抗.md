　　Brutal Atrocities, Heroic Resistance
　　By Our Correspondent Tian Liu
　　The atrocities of the American invading army in Korea are becoming increasingly brutal. The resistance of the Korean people is becoming more resolute and heroic. After suffering repeated defeats in Korea, the enemy has implemented a policy of mad destruction, attempting to suppress the Korean people. However, the Korean people have never yielded. With the support of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, they are bravely and tenaciously resisting the invaders, digging a grave for the greedy and shameless MacArthur and his ilk.
　　During my time reporting in Korea, I have passed through countless burning villages and walked past countless new graves. This bloody reality makes it clear that one of the purposes of the American invaders' arrival in Korea is to destroy the Korean people and the people's Korea.
　　Shortly after the New Year, I stayed in Xinli, Shuncheon County. It was the only intact village I had seen in Korea in two months. The village is surrounded by small hills covered with green pines, and a stream that does not freeze even in winter flows by the village. The houses, with their tiled roofs, are evenly nestled at the foot of the mountains, beside the stream, and among the pine forests. Entering this village at night, with the moonlight shining through the tops of the pine trees and the stars twinkling in the night sky, I was reminded of the opening lines of a folk song, "Sending My Man on a Stretcher," composed by the Chinese People's Volunteer stretcher team: "The moon climbs the mountain ridge, stars bloom in the sky."
　　In a small house by the village, there lived a woman with a shaved head. According to Jin Wanfu, the chairman of the Farmers' Alliance in the village, she was a labor party member, and her hair was cut off by the American and Li bandits. During the enemy's occupation, all female labor party members and family members of labor party members had their heads shaved as a mark, indicating that they were "red elements" and could be arbitrarily raped, murdered, and insulted. Xinli is a small village of fewer than twenty households, yet eight women who had not escaped were shaved and subjected to indescribable abuses by the beasts. The husbands of seven of these women were murdered.
　　Comrade Jin Wanfu, a simple and kind farmer in his forties, also told many horrifying stories of the enemy's atrocities.
　　Zheng Changhao was one of the labor party members who did not have time to retreat when the enemy occupied Xinli and was captured by the enemy. The bandits wanted to learn about the labor party situation in the village and other information from Comrade Zheng Changhao in order to further slaughter and ravage the people of the village. The enemy tortured him, breaking pine sticks as thick as arms, but Zheng Changhao said nothing, not even uttering a groan. Faced with this giant as solid as a rock, the enemy, more brutal than beasts, could do nothing. Therefore, the enemy used a thick iron wire to pierce Zheng Changhao's nose, forcing his wife to pull the wire and run. Zheng Changhao remained silent, looking at the enemy with his head held high. He thought to himself: I want to show the enemy what a labor party member is like. The enemy howled in a pig-like, hoarse voice: "Labor party members, come and register quickly, those who disobey the order will be like Zheng Changhao." However, the enemy's "demonstration" only provoked more anger and hatred from the people. Everyone stood silently at their doors, staring at the unfolding tragedy. Old man Jin, sixty-three years old, bit his lips until they bled. One day, two days, three days... passed, and not a single labor party member surrendered. Finally, the enemy killed Zheng Changhao and threw his body into the mountain stream. His wife is still bedridden, deliriously cursing the enemy.
　　The bandits entrenched themselves in this village for fifty days before being defeated by the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. In these short fifty days, the enemy committed countless crimes. When the enemy fled, they abducted all the young people. According to those who occasionally escaped, the enemy massacred the abductees in batches along the way. According to confirmed information, ten members of the Farmers' Alliance were killed; in one small village of fewer than fifty households alone, eight farmers were killed. The enemy ate half of the cattle in that village, all the pigs and chickens, and destroyed and burned all the farm tools. In the entire county, 1,799 people were brutally murdered by the enemy, including 529 women and 343 children; 1,914 women were raped; and the whereabouts of more than 41,600 people are still unknown.
　　The enemy's cruelty is indescribable. In Xinxingdong, Duanchuan County, twenty-one young women were subjected to all kinds of humiliation by the enemy, stripped naked, led through the streets with ropes, and finally beheaded one by one in the rice fields. In Zhuyongli, with only 210 people, 72 people were killed, including 20 children under the age of eight and six mothers carrying nursing babies. In Ershangli, the bandits stripped two pregnant women naked and beat their abdomens with wooden sticks. When the pregnant women's bellies ruptured, the beasts clapped and laughed. In Lantiandi, Ningbian County, the bandits captured a young woman who was eight months pregnant, first chopped off her feet, then her hands, and then cut open her abdomen, and put the unborn baby on the tip of a bayonet... When the enemy retreated from Hamhung, they forced 120,000 people to leave their homes. The bandits swept with machine guns along the way; cars ran over people. When they were driven into the sea, they drove innocent people onto ships. Unprecedented massacres and insults were carried out at sea. The beasts threw people into the sea in batches. In the coastal area of ​​Xihujin, there are still many corpses washed ashore. Relatives stood by the sea in groups, identifying their loved ones. More than 10,000 bodies have now been found. The enemy's atrocities did not frighten the heroic Korean people. Now, not only are those who are armed engaging in life-and-death battles with the invaders, but even those who fall into the hands of the enemy remain steadfast. In Xinxingdong, Duanchuan County, there is a one-eyed farmer named Jin Renshe, who had his only eye gouged out by the enemy. The enemy asked him: "Can you still see your Kim Il-sung?" He shouted in a voice that shook the mountains and rivers: "Yes, yes!"
　　The Korean people are brave and strong. They bear all these disasters with their chests held high. For the victory of the motherland and for a happy tomorrow, everyone contributes everything they have. The day after Xinli, Shuncheon County was liberated, thirty young people joined the People's Army hand in hand. Prior to them, seventy-five young people from this village of 260 households had already been fighting victoriously with the enemy in the People's Army. Those who remained in the village organized self-defense forces and quickly restored social order. The day after the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army launched the third campaign against the enemy, the farmers drove ten carts overnight to the front line to carry out transportation work. Although the enemy burned and robbed most of their granaries, and their lives were already difficult, they still tightened their belts and took out the grain buried in the mountains to pay public grain. Within three days, they collected more than 3,000 bags of rice and more than 2,000 bags of other grains. All the work in the village has been restored. In the "Democratic Propaganda Room," where huge portraits of Kim Il-sung, Mao Zedong, and Stalin are hung, mass meetings and other meetings are often held to spread the news of victory and carry out all mobilization work. The spring plowing work has already begun to be prepared. The Farmers' Alliance has thoroughly investigated farm tools and seeds, helped farmers organize labor exchange teams to solve the difficulties of farm tools and plowing animals caused by the enemy's destruction, and organized farmers to make full use of the short time before the arrival of spring plowing to develop household sideline production. Now, almost every family is weaving straw bags. The cleaning and fertilizer accumulation campaign, which is combined with the spring epidemic prevention and health work, has also been enthusiastically carried out throughout the village. Two months ago, when I passed a certain station, the station was still scarred and battered, the rails were scattered haphazardly by the roadside, and the wires were lying on the snow. Now the station has been completely restored, and the nearby coal mine has also started work. The Korean working class stands on the front line of the Patriotic War. For example, half of the workers in this coal mine have joined the People's Army to directly strike the invaders, and the remaining workers have taken on the entire burden of production. One miner said that in the five years after liberation, his life, in terms of wages alone, has increased by two times compared with the era of Japanese imperialist rule. "It is such a country that has turned me from a beast of burden into a master, from poverty to prosperity." He said: "Therefore, in order to defend my country and to defend my happy life, I will contribute everything I have, even my life." Yes, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and General Kim Il-sung, the industrial production of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the first half of 1950 had reached 117.5 percent of that in 1944. Workers' wages have increased by 80 percent compared with 1946. The land reform in northern Korea was completed in 1946, and more than 720,000 poor farmers received nearly one million hectares of land; the hard work of the farmers who became masters of their own land made the agricultural production in 1948 exceed the highest output during the Japanese imperialist rule; the farmers' lives were greatly improved, and more than 180,000 households have been repaired and newly built in the past five years alone. Comrade Jin Wanfu, the chairman of the Farmers' Alliance in Xinli, Shuncheon County, said: "These great achievements were all created by the people themselves. Therefore, when American imperialism invaded our sacred motherland and destroyed our great life built with hard work, everyone devoted themselves to the great struggle to defend the motherland, regardless of everything."
　　I fully understand this truth. The great people of our great motherland have taken this path and achieved victory. The Korean people, who are as brave and hardworking as the Chinese people, will also achieve victory, and have already achieved great victories and are advancing towards final victory.

　　残暴的兽行，英勇的反抗
    本报记者  田流
    美国侵略军在朝鲜的兽行，越来越残暴了。朝鲜人民的反抗，更加坚决与英勇。敌人在朝鲜连吃败仗以后，实行了疯狂的毁灭政策，妄图压住朝鲜的人民。但是，朝鲜人民绝未屈服，他们在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军支助之下，英勇顽强地反抗侵略者，给贪婪无耻的麦克阿瑟之徒，挖掘了死亡的坟墓。
    在朝鲜采访期间，我穿过多少燃烧的村庄，走过多少成群的新坟，这种血淋淋的现实，使人明确地想到，美国侵略者到朝鲜来的目的之一，就是毁灭朝鲜的人民和人民的朝鲜。
    新年后不久，我投宿在顺川郡新里。这是两个月来，我在朝鲜看到的唯一的完好无损的村庄。村的四周有长满了青松的小山环绕着，村边流着寒冬都不结冰的小溪，片片鳞彩的房子，十分匀称地坎镶在山脚下、小溪旁、松林间。晚上进入这个村庄，这时月光从松林梢头照过来，星星在夜空里闪耀，此情此景，使我想起日间在中国人民志愿担架队里听到他们自己编的“送郎出担架”小唱中开头的两句：“月儿上山崖，星儿满天花”的诗句。
    村边一所小房子里，有一个推光了头的女主人。据里（村）农民同盟委员长金万福说，她是劳动党员，她的头发是美李匪徒剪掉的。在敌人侵占时期，所有女劳动党员和劳动党员的眷属，都被剃光了头发，作为标记，指明她们是“赤色分子”，可以任意奸淫、屠杀和侮辱。新里是个不满二十户的小庄子，就有八个未及逃走的妇女，被剪光了头，遭到了野兽们难以形容的蹂躏，其中有七个人的丈夫被屠杀了。
    金万福同志，这位四十来岁的淳朴善良的农民，还说了许多骇人听闻的敌人暴行的故事。
    郑昌镐是敌人侵占新里时没有来得及撤退的劳动党员之一，被敌人捉住了。匪徒们想从郑昌镐同志口中了解全村劳动党的情况和其他方面的情报，以便进一步屠杀和蹂躏全村人民。敌人拷打他，把胳臂粗的松木棒都打折了，但郑昌镐什么也没有说，甚至都没有哎哟一声。对于这位岩石一样的巨人，残暴甚于禽兽的敌人，也再无他法可施。于是，敌人用一根粗铁丝，把郑昌镐的鼻子穿起来，强迫他的妻子牵着铁丝跑。郑昌镐仍然一声不响，昂首怒视敌人，穿过大街小巷。他心里想着：我要叫敌人看看，这就是劳动党员。敌人用猪叫似的沙嗓子嚎叫着：“劳动党员们快来登记，违抗命令的人都要像郑昌镐一样。”但是，敌人的“示威游行”所得到的只是人民的更加愤怒和仇视，所有的人都一言不发地站在门口，正视着这场惨剧的进行。六十三岁的金老汉，把嘴唇都咬破了。一天、两天、三天……过去了，没有一个劳动党员去自首。最后，敌人杀了郑昌镐，把尸首投到山涧里。他的妻子，到现在还病卧床上，发着呓语，咒骂敌人。
    匪徒们在这个村庄盘据了五十天以后，就被英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军击溃了。在这短短的五十天中，敌人造下了数不清的罪行。敌人临窜逃时，把所有的青年人都掳走了。据偶而逃回的人说，敌人在路上成批地屠杀着那些被掳者。据已经查明的，农民同盟的十个委员被杀；仅在一个不满五十户的小庄子上，就有八个农民被杀。敌人在那个庄子上吃掉了一半的耕牛，全部的猪和鸡，捣毁并烧掉所有的农具。在全郡（县），被敌人惨杀者达一千七百九十九人，其中有五百二十九个妇女和三百四十三个儿童；有一千九百一十四个妇女被奸污；有四万一千六百余人，至今还找不到下落。
    敌人的残暴是说不尽的。在端川郡的新洞里，二十一个青年妇女被敌人百般侮辱后，还被剥光了衣服，用绳子牵着，在大街上游行，最后一个一个地被砍死在稻田里。在仅有二百一十人的朱用里，就有七十二人被杀，其中有二十个八岁以下的儿童，六个背着吃奶婴儿的母亲。在二上里，匪徒们剥光两个孕妇的衣服，用木棍敲打她们的腹部。孕妇的肚子破裂了，野兽们在一旁鼓掌大笑。在宁边郡兰田里，匪徒们捉住一位怀孕八个月的青年妇女，先剁去双足，又剁去两手，而后开膛破肚，把未出世的婴儿挑在刺刀尖上……。咸兴敌人溃退时，逼迫着十二万人离开了他们的家园。匪徒们一路扫着机枪；汽车从人身上轧过去。当它们被赶下海去的时候，又把无辜的人民驱上船去。空前未闻的虐杀和侮辱又在海上进行了。野兽们把人们成批地投入海里。在西湖津沿海的地方，至今还有许多尸体飘上岸来。亲属们成群地伫立海边，辨视自己的亲人，现在已经找到了一万多尸体。敌人的暴行并没有吓住英勇的朝鲜人民，现在不仅手执武器的人们同侵略者进行着生死的决斗，即便有些人落于敌手，仍然是坚贞不屈。端川郡新兴洞有位一只眼睛的农民，名金仁燮，他被敌人挖去了唯一的眼睛。敌人问他：“你还能看见你的金日成么？”他用震撼山河的声音高呼：“能，能！”
    朝鲜人民是勇敢而坚强的，他们挺胸承担着这一切的灾难。他们为着祖国的胜利，为着幸福的明天，每个人都供献着自己的一切。顺川郡新里解放的第二天，三十个青年手挽手地参加了人民军。在他们之先，这个二百六十户的村庄，已经有七十五个青年在人民军中同敌人进行着胜利的战斗。留在村里的人组织起自卫队，迅速恢复了社会治安。在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队向敌人发起第三次战役的第二天，农民们连夜赶着十辆大车，到前线担任运输工作。虽然敌人烧毁和抢去了他们大部分粮仓，他们的生活已很困难，但是，他们仍然节衣缩食，把埋在山里的粮食拿出来缴公粮，三天之内就收集了三千余袋稻子和二千余袋其他粮食。该村的一切工作都已恢复起来。高悬着金日成、毛泽东和斯大林巨像的“民主宣传室”里，经常举行着群众大会和其他会议，传播着胜利消息，进行着一切动员工作。春耕工作已经开始准备起来，农民同盟已经详细调查农具、籽种，帮助农民组织换工插犋班，解决因敌人破坏而造成的农具耕畜困难，组织农民充分利用春耕尚未到来的短促时间，开展家庭副业生产。现在，几乎每个家庭都在织草袋子；和春季防疫卫生工作结合进行的清扫积肥运动，也已在全村热烈地进行了。两个月前，我过某某车站时，车站上还是鳞伤满目，铁轨横七竖八地丢在路旁，电线落在雪地上。现在该站已经完全恢复，附近的煤矿也开工了。朝鲜的工人阶级站在卫国战争的最前线上，例如，这个煤矿有一半工人参加了人民军，直接打击侵略者，剩下的工人则担负起全部生产重担。一位矿工说，在解放后的五年中，他的生活，仅工资一项，就比日寇统治时代提高了二倍，“就是这样的国家使我从牛马变成主人，由贫穷变为富裕。”他说：“因此，为着保卫我的国家，为着保卫我的幸福生活，我将贡献我的一切，甚至生命。”是的，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在劳动党和金日成将军领导之下，一九五○年上半年的工业生产已经达到了一九四四年的百分之一一七点五。工人工资比一九四六年增加了百分之八十。朝鲜北部的土地改革一九四六年便完成了，七十二万余贫苦的农民得到了将近一百万以上公顷的土地；成为自己土地的主人的农民们的辛勤劳动，在一九四八年就使农业的生产量，超过日寇统治时代的最高产量；农民生活大为改善，五年来仅修缮和新建房屋的就超过十八万户。顺川郡新里农民同盟委员长金万福同志说：“这些伟大的成就，都是人民自己创造的。因此，当美帝国主义侵略我们的神圣祖国，破坏我们辛勤缔造的伟大生活时，每个人便不顾一切地献身于保卫祖国的伟大斗争了。”
    我完全懂得这个道理，我们伟大祖国的伟大人民就是走过这条道路，取得胜利的。和中国人民同样勇敢而勤劳的朝鲜人民，同样会得到胜利，并且已经得到巨大的胜利和正向最后胜利前进。
