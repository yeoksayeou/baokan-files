    Beijing Public Security Bureau Upholds the Interests of the Working Class, Lawfully Arrests Unlawful Capitalist Yang Kuaisheng

    To the Editor:

    On March 23rd, the Fourth Outer Branch of the Public Security Bureau, accepting the demands of our workers, detained Yang Kuaisheng, the capitalist of Shengchang Auto Parts Shop on Xuanwumenwai Street, who has consistently abused workers. This is a necessary measure by the government to protect human rights and uphold the law. We are now reporting the details of the incident to you.

    On March 7th, Yang Kuaisheng sent apprentice Yang Kuizhong to Tianjin to purchase 370 pieces of ball bearings. After Yang Kuizhong returned to Beijing, the capitalist discovered that over 40 of the pieces were of inferior quality and held a grudge. On the 20th, Yang Kuaisheng used a pretext to push Yang Kuizhong down the stairs, smashing his right forehead, causing blood to flow profusely and staining his cotton-padded coat with blood. After committing the assault, Yang Kuaisheng ordered the apprentices to clean the bloodstains on the stairs and forbade the beaten apprentice from making a sound. When Li Jinhui, the director of the Eighth District Branch of the Hardware Industry Union, learned of this and went to the shop to investigate, Yang Kuaisheng arrogantly replied, "I was the one who beat him. I've beaten people everywhere I've gone. I don't need you to come and meddle. I've never been taken down before, what can you do to me?"

    Yang Kuaisheng is notorious in the Eighth District hardware industry for his illegal abuse, oppression, and exploitation of workers. Before liberation, apprentices who worked at his shop were beaten and driven away before completing their apprenticeships. He even broke the arm of an apprentice named Gao Libin. After liberation, Yang remained unrepentant and intensified his actions. One winter evening last year, the apprentices came to the shop and prepared to rest. Yang Kuaisheng saw Yang Kuizhong dozing off and poured a basin of cold water on Yang Kuizhong's neck. Apprentice Zhang Xianhui was beaten mercilessly by Yang Kuaisheng for selling an iron ball bearing for 4,000 yuan less than it was worth, even breaking the feather duster handle. Apprentice Wang Kechang, who is only seventeen years old this year, has also been tormented by Yang Kuaisheng. In the past, he was only given enough money for three sesame cakes a day. He himself can't even remember the number of times he's been beaten. Last winter, Wang Kechang was beaten by Yang Kuaisheng with a fire shovel on his arm, causing a large lump, because he didn't clean up all the coal he picked up. On one occasion, Yang Kuaisheng even took off Wang Kechang's padded coat and brutally whipped Wang's back with a hemp rope dipped in cold water, forbidding him from telling anyone afterward.

    After the labor-capital collective contract was signed by the hardware industry in May of last year, Yang Kuaisheng superficially said that he would pay each apprentice 30 jin of millet per month, but he did not actually implement it. Based only on what we know, Yang Kuaisheng's actions in oppressing workers are already alarming. Yang Kuaisheng's acts of abuse and injury to workers have directly violated human rights and seriously violated policies and laws. The Eighth District Office of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, in order to protect the interests of workers, has supported us in filing a complaint with the relevant authorities. The Fourth Outer Branch of the Public Security Bureau has detained Yang Kuaisheng. We demand that the government severely punish Yang Kuaisheng according to the law and demand that he guarantee that no act of oppression against workers will ever occur again in the future.

### 北京市公安局维护工人阶级利益  依法拘捕不法资方杨魁盛

    北京市公安局维护工人阶级利益
    依法拘捕不法资方杨魁盛编辑同志：
    三月二十三日，公安外四分局接受我们工人的要求，将宣武门外大街盛昌汽车零件行一贯虐待工人的资方杨魁盛扣押了。这是政府保障人权，维护法令的必要措施。现在我们把事情经过报告给你。
    三月七日，杨魁盛派学徒杨魁忠去天津购买滚珠三百七十件。杨魁忠回北京后，资方发现其中有四十多件货色较差，即怀恨在心。二十日杨魁盛借故将杨魁忠推倒在楼梯上，砸破右额角，血流如注，棉袄上血迹斑斑。杨魁盛行凶后，一面命学徒将楼梯上血迹洗净，一面不许被打学徒声张。五金业工会八区分会主任李金惠知道这件事后，到该店调查时，杨魁盛态度傲慢地回答说：“人是我打的。我到那儿都是打了，用不着你来瞎嚷嚷。从先我就没窝过（即没栽过斤斗），你们把我怎样？”
    杨魁盛非法虐待、欺压与剥削工人，在八区五金同业中是闻名的。解放前在他柜上当学徒的工人，手艺未学满都一个个给他打走了。学徒高立彬连胳膊都给他打断了。解放后，杨仍不知悔悟，反而变本加厉。去年冬天一个晚上，学徒们上门后准备休息。杨魁盛瞥见杨魁忠在一边打盹，便用一盆凉水朝杨魁忠的脖子上泼去。学徒张现辉过去因为一个球铁轴少卖了四千元，杨魁盛就没命地打他，把鸡毛帚柄都打断了。学徒王克昌今年才十七岁，也被杨魁盛折磨得够呛。过去一天只给他三个烧饼钱。平常挨打的次数，连他本人也记不清了。去年冬王克昌因捡煤没捡净，被杨魁盛用生火的铁铲子把他的胳膊打得起了一个大疙瘩。有一次杨魁盛还脱掉王克昌身上的大棉袄，用麻绳蘸凉水朝王的脊背上狠毒地抽打，打毕还不许往外说。
    去年五月五金业劳资双方订集体合同后，杨魁盛表面上说每月给学徒每人三十斤小米的工资，实际上并未执行。仅就我们所知道的一些情况，杨魁盛压迫工人的行为已经是令人心惊了。杨魁盛这种虐待伤害工人的行为，已经直接侵害了人权，严重违反了政策法令。市总工会八区办事处为保护工人利益，已支持我们向有关机关进行控诉。公安外四分局已将杨魁盛扣押。我们要求政府依法严惩杨魁盛，并要他保证今后绝不发生任何压迫工人的行为。
        第八区五金业全体工人
