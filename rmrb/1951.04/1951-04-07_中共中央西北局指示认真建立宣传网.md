　　The Northwest Bureau of the CCP Central Committee recently inspected the establishment of propaganda networks in various parts of Northwest China, and found that Party organizations in various places were still not doing enough in publicizing to the people. Therefore, it issued "Instructions on Earnestly Implementing the Central Committee's Decision on Establishing Propaganda Networks." The instructions stated: Party organizations at various levels in the CCP have not fully implemented the Central Committee's decision on establishing propaganda networks. Some prefectural committees and county committees have not discussed the Central Committee's decision; some prefectural committees and county committees have not formulated specific implementation plans. Secondly, there are still empirical and conservative viewpoints among cadres in various places. They are hesitant about the establishment of propaganda networks and emphasize difficulties. Some cadres pit the establishment of propaganda networks against other tasks. They believe that establishing propaganda networks will hinder the completion of other work tasks. The instructions pointed out that these cadres did not realize that establishing propaganda networks is an effective way to solve the difficulty of having too few propaganda workers; strengthening the Party's propaganda work to the people, deeply publicizing policies, and raising the political awareness of the people are the primary conditions for ensuring the completion of all work. The idea of pitting the establishment of propaganda networks against other work is essentially an idea of abolishing the Party's propaganda work and an idea of habitually using simple administrative orders to treat the people.
　　The instructions ordered Party committees at all levels to formulate specific plans for establishing propaganda networks based on local conditions. Party committees at all levels should conduct a special inspection in the near future and strictly establish the Party's leadership system for propaganda work. The instructions also ordered Party committees in various places to establish a reporting system above the county level before May.

　　中共中央西北局指示认真建立宣传网
    中共中央西北局最近检查了西北各地建立宣传网的情况，发现各地党组织对人民群众的宣传工作还作得很不够，因此发出了“关于认真执行中央建立宣传网决定的指示”。指示称：各地中共党的组织在建立宣传网工作中，还没有完全贯彻中共中央关于建立宣传网的决定。有些地委和县委还没有讨论中央的决定；有的地委和县委没有订出具体执行的计划。其次，在各地干部中还存在着经验主义的保守观点，他们对建立宣传网工作表示犹疑，强调困难。有的干部把建立宣传网与其他工作对立起来。他们认为建立宣传网会妨碍其他工作任务的完成。指示指出，这些干部没有认识到，建立宣传网正是解决宣传工作干部少的困难的有效办法；加强党对人民群众的宣传工作，深入宣传政策，提高人民群众的政治觉悟，正是保证完成一切工作的首要条件。把建立宣传网和其他工作对立起来的思想，实质上是取消党的宣传工作的思想，是习惯于用简单的行政命令方法去对待人民群众的思想。
    指示责成各级党委根据当地实际情况，订出建立宣传网的具体计划。各级党委在最近时期内，应进行一次专门检查，严格地把党对宣传工作的领导制度建立起来。指示并责成各地党委应在五月以前把县级以上的报告员制度建立起来。
