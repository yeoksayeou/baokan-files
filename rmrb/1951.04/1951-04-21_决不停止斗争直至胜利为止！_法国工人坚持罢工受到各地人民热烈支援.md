　　Never Stop Fighting Until Victory!
　　French Workers Persist in Strike, Receiving Enthusiastic Support from People Everywhere
    [Xinhua News Agency, Eighteenth Dispatch from Paris] News from Paris: Amid soaring prices, the wave of strikes in France continues to rise and fall, remaining turbulent.

    The strike at the Brest Naval Arsenal, which began on March 22nd, is still ongoing. After a meeting on the 14th, the 6,500 striking workers of the entire factory announced that they are determined to fight until they achieve complete victory, regardless of the brutal persecution by the police. They resolutely demand that the government allocate funds from the military budget to increase their wages by 20 francs per hour and to issue bonuses of 6,000 francs. They also demand the implementation of a wage adjustment system based on the price index. The heroic struggle of the workers at the Brest Naval Arsenal has received enthusiastic support from people everywhere. Local people have invited them and their children to their homes for meals. Workers at the Cherbourg Naval Arsenal donated 50,000 francs to their strike fund and, along with workers from Lorient and other naval arsenals, held a short strike on the 10th to express their solidarity.

    The 20,000 steelworkers of Marseille, under the leadership of the action committee composed of representatives from the General Confederation of Labor, "Workers' Force," and the Christian Labor Federation, have been on strike since the 9th, demanding a 15 percent wage increase. Workers at four factories have already achieved partial victory.

    Iron ore miners in eastern France have also gone on strike, completely halting mining operations in the region. Trade unions affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor, "Workers' Force," and the Christian Labor Federation in Limoges, western France, jointly held a "Day of Struggle for Wage Increases" on the 14th.

    Currently, employees of French postal, telephone, telegraph, and airline companies are all demanding wage increases.

    Wherever workers act in unity, the strikers' demands can be met. Sailors of the merchant fleet, workers at the "Dusseldorf" factory, and workers in several enterprises in the Pas-de-Calais department have forced the government and factory owners to agree to wage increases. French General Confederation of Labor General Secretary Frachon wrote in L'Humanité on the 15th that the government and factory owners' policy of trying to discourage the working class has completely failed. The working class has realized that only through unity in struggle can victory be achieved.

　  法国工人坚持罢工受到各地人民热烈支援
    【新华社十八日讯】巴黎消息：在物价飞涨声中，法国的罢工浪潮此伏彼起，继续汹涌不已。
    从三月二十二日就开始的布勒斯特海军兵工厂的罢工，迄今仍在坚持中。全厂六千五百名罢工工人在十四日举行会议后宣布：他们决心不顾警察的残暴迫害，一直斗争到获得全部胜利为止。他们坚决要求政府从军事预算中拨款为他们增加工资每小时二十法郎，并发给奖金六千法郎，同时还要求实行按物价指数调整工资的制度。布勒斯特海军兵工厂工人的英勇斗争，受到了各地人民的热烈支援。当地人民纷纷请他们和他们的孩子回家吃饭。瑟堡海军兵工厂的工人捐献了五万法郎给他们做罢工基金，并且和罗利翁以及其他各地海军兵工厂的工人一道在十日举行了短期罢工，表示声援。
    马赛的二万钢铁工人，在总工会、“工人力量”和天主教劳工联盟各工会的代表们组成的行动委员会的领导下，已于九日起举行罢工，要求增加工资百分之十五。有四个工厂的工人已经获得部分胜利。
    法国东部的铁矿工人也已经罢工，这个地区的采矿工作已完全停顿。法国西部里摩日城总工会、“工人力量”和天主教劳工联盟所属各冶金工人和五金工人工会组织，在十四日联合举行了“为增加工资而斗争日”。
    现在，法国的邮政、电话、电报和航空公司的雇员，都在要求增加工资。
    凡是工人们统一行动的地方，罢工者的要求就能得到满足。商船队的海员、“杜塞尔”工厂的工人和加来海峡省若干企业的工人，都已迫使政府和厂主答应提高工资。法国总工会总书记佛拉商十五日在人道报上撰文指出：政府和厂主想使工人阶级气馁的政策已经完全破产。工人阶级已经了解到：只有在斗争中团结一致，才能获得胜利。
