Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th—The Soviet people are enthusiastically celebrating the victorious completion of the Soviet post-war Five-Year Plan and are gathering to guarantee even greater efforts in communist construction.

　　Workers at the Moscow "Hammer and Sickle" factory completed their five-year production targets in less than four years. Steelworker Grebeshikov said: "During the five years, I overproduced 4,800 tons of steel. My labor has strengthened the power of the motherland. I will work hard to produce more steel for communist construction." Last year, the output of Moscow's First Ball Bearing Factory exceeded the pre-war level by 79 percent, and the profits from over-planned production reached 22.2 million rubles. The forging, grinding, machining, and assembly workers of the factory have decided to complete the April plan before April 25th and the annual plan before October 5th, and guarantee the production of high-quality products.

　　Mironov, foreman of the tractor workshop at the Kirov factory in Leningrad, said: "We love our motherland and are determined to contribute all our strength to the victory of communism." Workers in the steelmaking workshop of the factory have guaranteed to complete orders for the Tsimlyanskaya Hydroelectric Station one month ahead of schedule.

　　At a mass meeting held at the Minsk Tractor Factory in the capital of Belarus, welder Antonik said: "Our people are faithfully fighting for peace through creative labor. Our labor is part of the overall achievements of the entire Soviet Union." Petrov, a steelworker in the Donets Basin, said: "We feel very proud to hear that our labor contributes to the revival of the southern black metal smelting industry in the motherland. The metal we produce is used for peace and communist construction." The Kiev "Lenin Blacksmith" machine factory completed its five-year plan in three years and ten months. Many workers in the factory have guaranteed to work better. Last year, the output of the Almaty Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant was two and a half times that of 1946, and the output of metallurgical equipment was five and a half times. Sand-turning worker Martinco, who completed seven years of production quotas in three years, announced that he would complete three production quotas every day.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th—People from all countries enthusiastically celebrated the successful completion of the Soviet post-war Five-Year Plan, and unanimously pointed out that this is a great contribution to the cause of world peace.

　　Park Jung-ae, Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's League, said: "The achievements of the Soviet Union in implementing the post-war Five-Year Plan eloquently prove the increasing strength of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's consistent pursuit of a peace-loving policy. The victory of the Soviet Union is the victory of progressive mankind who loves peace all over the world and is an unbreakable force to prevent the American and British imperialists from launching a new world war."

　　The German Democratic Republic's "Berliner Zeitung" published a commentary stating: The great achievements of the Soviet Union fully prove the peaceful nature of the Soviet economy and reflect the great power of the Soviet Union. Poland's "Warsaw Life" newspaper said: "The achievements of the Soviet Union are a guarantee for the successful completion of the economic plans of the people's democratic countries, and deepen the understanding of the working people of the imperialist countries that the peace camp will inevitably win." Czechoslovakia's "Red Right" newspaper published an editorial saying: "The achievements of the Soviet Union prove the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system." Hungarian newspapers all published the full text of the Soviet communiqué on the front page. "Free People" newspaper said: The completion of the Soviet post-war Five-Year Plan is "an event of great international significance. It encourages millions of oppressed people to further carry out the struggle for liberation and a better life." Romanian Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Stoica wrote in "Spark" newspaper: "The victory of the Soviet people is a huge material basis for their brotherly assistance to the Romanian people." Bulgaria's "Worker's Business" newspaper commented: "This victory inspires the Bulgarian people to unremittingly learn from the rich experience of the Soviet Union."

　　Italy's "Unità" published the communiqué on the results of the Soviet Five-Year Plan under a banner headline on the front page, and wrote: "The Soviet Union's early completion of the Five-Year Plan proves that socialist countries are fighting for peace and the happiness of the people of the world. However, American imperialism is pursuing the criminal policy of launching wars." The Dutch Communist Party's newspaper "Truth" published a summary communiqué of the Soviet Five-Year Plan. The newspaper was immediately sold out. The newspaper made a clear comparison between the thriving life of the Soviet people and the impoverished conditions of the people in Western imperialist countries in its commentary. Israel's "Kol Ha'am" and "Al-Hamisma" newspapers both published the communiqué on the results of the Soviet post-war Five-Year Plan.

    莫斯科“锤子与镰刀”工厂的工人不到四年便完成了五年计划的生产任务。炼钢工人格列别希科夫说：“我在五年中超计划生产了四千八百吨钢，我的劳动已增强了祖国的威力，我要努力为共产主义建设生产更多的钢。”莫斯科第一球轴承工厂去年的生产量已超过战前水平的百分之七十九，超计划多生产的产品获利达二千二百万卢布。该厂锻冶、琢磨、机械及装配工人已决定在四月二十五日前完成四月份计划，在十月五日前完成本年计划，并保证生产优等质量的产品。
    列宁格勒基洛夫工厂的拖拉机车间领班米罗诺夫说：“我们热爱祖国，而且决心为共产主义的胜利贡献出全部力量。”该厂炼钢车间的工人已保证要提前一个月完成齐姆良斯卡雅水电站的订货。
    在白俄罗斯首都明斯克拖拉机工厂举行的群众大会上，电焊工人安托尼克说：“我国人民以创造性劳动为和平而忠诚地奋斗。全苏联的总成就中是有着我们的一分劳动的。”顿尼兹盆地的炼钢工人彼得罗夫说：“我们听到我们的劳动对祖国复兴南方黑色金属冶炼业的贡献，觉得非常骄傲。我们生产的金属是用于和平和共产主义的建设事业的。”基辅“列宁铁匠”机器制造厂在三年零十个月内完成了五年计划，该厂许多工人已保证要更好地工作。阿拉木图重型机器制造厂去年产量为一九四六年的两倍半，冶金装备的产量为五倍半。三年完成七年生产定额的翻沙工人马尔秦科宣布要每天完成三个生产定额。
    【新华社二十日讯】各国人民热烈欢呼苏联胜利完成战后五年计划，并一致指出这是苏联对世界和平事业的伟大贡献。
    朝鲜民主妇女同盟委员长朴正爱说：“苏联执行战后五年计划的成就，雄辩地证明了苏联威力的日益壮大，和苏联始终不渝地奉行爱好和平的政策。苏联的胜利是全世界爱好和平的进步人类的胜利，是防止美英帝国主义者发动新世界战争的坚不可破的力量。”
    德意志民主共和国的《柏林日报》发表评论称：苏联的巨大成就充分证明苏联经济的和平性质，并且反映了苏联的巨大威力。波兰《华沙生活》报说：“苏联的成就是人民民主国家胜利完成经济计划的保证，并且加深了帝国主义国家的劳动人民对于和平阵营必然获胜的认识。”捷克斯洛伐克《红色权利》报发表社论说：“苏联的成就证明了社会主义制度的无比优越。”匈牙利各报均以首页地位发表了苏联公报的全文，《自由人民》报称：苏联战后五年计划的完成是“具有重大国际意义的事件，它鼓舞着千百万被压迫人民进一步进行争取解放和美好生活的斗争”。罗马尼亚部长会议副主席斯托依卡在《火花报》上撰文称：“苏联人民的胜利是他们给罗马尼亚人民以兄弟般援助的巨大物质基础。”保加利亚《工人事业》报评称：“这一胜利鼓舞着保加利亚人民坚持不懈地学习苏联的丰富经验。”
