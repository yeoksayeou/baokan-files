　　All-China Federation of Cooperatives Holds Materials Exchange Meeting

　　From April 16th to 23rd, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives convened a meeting in Beijing of heads of sales departments from the cooperative federations of major administrative regions (excluding the Southwest), the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the five provinces of North China to hold a materials exchange meeting. At this meeting, representatives from local cooperatives reported on the progress of materials exchange in the first quarter, sales plans for the second quarter, and the pre-purchase of industrial raw materials such as cotton and hemp. Discussions were held to determine future approaches. Finally, local cooperatives signed eighteen materials exchange contracts with each other, totaling more than 127 billion yuan; and established ten exchange agreements, totaling more than 171 billion yuan. The exchanged materials included 37 kinds of agricultural, sideline, and native products such as corn, sorghum, soybean cake, soybean oil, wool, live pigs, apples, bananas, reed mats, and eggs.

　　From the reports of local representatives, it can be seen that since the National Cooperative Business Meeting in December last year, local cooperatives have begun to attach importance to sales work, and local areas have held materials exchange meetings and signed a large number of exchange contracts. In areas where sales work has been done relatively well, native products that had been unsalable for many years have opened up sales channels, and therefore the purchasing power of farmers in those areas has greatly increased. At the same time, the cooperatives themselves have also gained some experience. For example, the Hebei Provincial Federation of Cooperatives convened a materials exchange meeting among the special district cooperatives in late February, which helped members sell a large number of unsalable products, such as slate from Tongxian Special District, sweet potato chips and charcoal from Tangshan Special District, and porcelain and chili peppers from Handan Special District. At the same time, the cooperatives exchanged a large number of means of production and livelihood materials such as pesticides, cotton seeds, rice seeds, corn, and soap for the members. The Shanxi Provincial Federation of Cooperatives held a professional meeting to study the specifications and sales of local products, and solved the problem of hawthorn unsalability. However, local cooperatives still have some problems in selling agricultural and sideline products, especially in selling local products, such as not starting from serving the production of members, and not conducting investigation and research. Therefore, the members' local products are not selling well, and the obligations stipulated in the contract cannot be fulfilled after the contract is signed. In response to the above problems, Liang Yao, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, pointed out in the meeting's summary report that in order to do a good job in sales, the following points must be achieved:

　　1. Sales must be aimed at developing the production of members. The practice of simply making profits by emphasizing popular goods and neglecting unpopular goods, emphasizing plains and neglecting mountainous areas is incorrect.

　　2. It is necessary to understand what members produce in what season, what the output, specifications, and quality are through local product exchange meetings, member representative meetings, and investigation and statistics meetings. At the same time, professional meetings should be held to understand the supply and sales, transportation, and price issues of various local products.

　　3. Sales should be organized in many ways according to different sales targets and regions. In addition to meeting the needs of the country, sales should first be found within the cooperative system and in the local market. The working methods of only looking outward and not inward, passively waiting, and relying on foreign sales must be corrected.

　　4. Strengthen economic accounting and reduce the cost of goods. Do not let the goods take detours, try to organize the processing of local products, and stipulate the expenditure standards and main material damage rates of cooperatives at all levels.

　　5. Strictly abide by contract credit and enforce economic discipline. Those who violate the contract without reason should be sanctioned, and serious cases can be sent to the people's court for handling.

　　In order to welcome the National Materials Exchange Conference to be held in August, the National Federation of Cooperatives requested at the meeting that local cooperatives start from the grassroots cooperatives to conduct detailed investigations on the production and sales of members' agricultural and sideline products and local products, and prepare specific opinions on business management.

　　Regarding the pre-purchase of industrial raw materials such as cotton and hemp, local areas have achieved very good results. The average pre-purchase volume of cotton has reached one-quarter of the total national output of ginned cotton. In order to further develop the pre-purchase work, Deputy Director Liang Yao pointed out in the summary of the meeting: 1. The pre-purchase work should be agreed upon by the relevant departments of the People's Government and the central party committees at all levels and done together. 2. Attention should be paid to organizing the "order form" work, detailing the names, specifications, quantities, delivery time, procedures, and other items of the goods needed by farmers to ensure the supply of physical objects. 3. Cotton processing work should be prepared. 4. Credit pre-purchase work should be fully developed, and the pre-purchase method of pre-paying physical objects should not be advocated too much.

### 全国合作总社召开物资交换会议

　　全国合作总社召开物资交换会议
    四月十六日至二十三日，全国合作总社召集各大行政区（西南在外）、内蒙自治区及华北五省的合作总社推销部门负责人在北京举行物资交换会议。在这次会议上，各地合作社代表汇报了第一季度物资交换工作情况、第二季度的推销计划、以及棉、麻等工业原料的预购工作情况，并进行讨论，确定了今后的做法。最后，各地合作社间相互签订了十八件物资交换合同，总值一千二百七十多亿元；成立交换协议十件，总值一千七百一十亿元。交换物资包括玉米、高粱、豆饼、豆油、羊毛、活猪、苹果、香蕉、苇席、鸡蛋等农业副业产品和土产品三十七种。
    从各地代表的汇报中可以看出，自去年十二月全国合作社业务会议以后，各地合作社已开始重视推销工作，各地都举行了物资交换会议，订立了大批交换合同。在推销工作做得比较好的地区，多年滞销的土产品已打开了销路，因此那些地区的农民购买力已大大提高。同时合作社本身也获得了一些经验。例如河北省总社于二月下旬召开的各专区社间的物资交流会议，曾替社员销出了大批滞销产品，如通县专区的石板，唐山专区的白薯干、木炭，邯郸专区的磁货、辣椒、蒲扇。同时合作社为社员换进了大批农药、棉籽、稻种、玉米、肥皂等生产资料与生活资料。山西省总社召开了专业会议，研究了土产的规格与销路，解决了山楂的滞销问题。但各地合作社在推销农业副业产品，特别是推销土产中，还存在着一些问题，例如推销不是从为社员的生产服务出发，不调查研究等。因此，社员的土产不得畅销，合同订立后不能履行合同中规定的义务。针对上述问题，全国合作总社副主任梁耀在会议总结报告中指出，要做好推销工作，必须做到以下几点：
    一、推销必须以发展社员生产为目的。重热货轻冷货、重平原轻山地等单纯为了盈利的做法都是不对的。
    二、必须通过土产交流会议、社员代表会议、调查统计会议，了解社员在什么季节生产什么？产量、规格、质量如何？同时召开专业会，了解各种土产的供销情况、运输情况与价格问题。
    三、应根据不同的推销对象与地区，多方面去组织推销。除了满足国家的需要外，首先应在合作社系统内和本地市场上去找销路。只向外不向内、消极等待、依赖外销的工作方法必须纠正。
    四、加强经济核算，减低货物成本。不让货物走弯路，尽量组织土产加工，规定各级社的开支标准和主要物资的伤耗率。
    五、严守合同信用，执行经济纪律。对无故不守合同者应加以制裁，严重的可送人民法院处理。
    为了迎接将在八月间召开的全国物资交流会议，全国总社在会上要求各地合作社由基层社开始详细调查社员农副产品及土产的产销情况，并准备经营管理上的具体意见。
    关于棉、麻等工业原料的预购工作，各地成绩都很好。棉花的预购量平均已达到全国皮棉总产量的四分之一。为了进一步开展预购工作，梁耀副主任在会议的总结中指出：一、预购工作应和人民政府各有关部门及各级中央党委协议一致，共同来做。二、要注意组织“订货单”工作，详细订明农民需要的货物品名、规格、数量、交货时间、手续等项，以保证实物供应。三、应准备棉花加工工作。四、应全力展开信用预购工作，不宜多提倡预付实物的预购方法。
