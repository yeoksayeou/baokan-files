Comrades and Catholic faithful across the country:

　　Today I am prepared to talk to you about the reform of Catholicism and the popularization and deepening of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement among Catholics, the promotion of the signature campaign to support the conclusion of a peace pact, and the voting campaign against the arming of Japan. You all know more than I do, and I am willing to follow behind you and work hard to do a good job with practical actions, and further stir up a climax of our love for the motherland and defense of world peace.
　　Our China is now a strong and independent country. With the strength of the country, Catholicism in China has the conditions to cleanse the stains of the past, and has the opportunity to enable 3.5 million Catholic friends across the country to enter the ranks of the broad masses of people and jointly build our motherland. Everyone must recognize that after the Opium War, imperialism used cannons to send a large number of foreign missionaries into our country. For more than 100 years, Catholicism has been an important tool used by imperialism to invade our country. They invaded our country by force, forced our country to sign unequal treaties, encroached on our sovereignty, oppressed our people, especially enslaved and poisoned the minds of our Catholic friends, causing them to forget their motherland, worship foreign lands, and not distinguish between the doctrines of God and the poison of imperialism, and even blurred the boundary between "divine right" and "human rights," allowing them to be enslaved and slaughtered without realizing it.
　　Opening the history of China in the last 100 years, we can see that the so-called missionary work of foreigners in China has had an inextricable relationship with their government's aggression against China from the very beginning. The "privilege of preaching" clause is clearly recorded in the unequal treaties, which is an irrefutable fact; and many of these unequal treaties were planned and plotted by missionaries who were so-called "China experts." The priests in China seized farmland, monopolized lawsuits, oppressed the people, and interfered in internal affairs, and their arrogance was boundless and they did everything. In 1860, the Manchu Qing government and France revised the treaty, and the French priest who was acting as a translator secretly added "French missionaries are allowed to rent and buy land in various provinces and build them at will." The Qing government was昏愦糊涂 and signed and recognized it. In 1867, Bishop Hong of France transferred officials from Sichuan Province and opened the seal of office for use. In 1868, Bishop Hu Fuli of Guizhou actually sent the Qing Dynasty a note of "recommendation for Daoyuan." In 1899, Fan Guohan, the French bishop in Beijing, and the Manchu Qing Prime Minister's Office formulated measures to treat priests, putting "bishops on par with governors and supervisors, church managers and chief priests on par with Si and Dao, and priests on par with prefectures and counties." Chinese officials had to answer and pay respects according to the ranks of the priests. Missionaries in Shandong also regarded themselves as the highest officials of a province and called themselves governors. Isn't this arrogant attitude of "casting seals of office," "recommending Daoyuan," and "calling themselves governors" completely regarding China as a colony? After the Sino-French Treaty, according to the regulations for returning churches, foreign priests went to various provinces and places to return churches. For a time, in Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hubei, Sichuan, Zhili, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Fengtian, Guangdong..., incidents of priests seizing farmland in the name of returning churches occurred everywhere. They had many methods, such as French priests forcibly buying houses from the people in Huai'an, British priests enclosing public land on Wumushan Mountain in Fuzhou, and American priests forcibly renting houses from the people in Dengzhou. After occupying the houses and land for a long time, they neither paid taxes nor transported food, and completely transferred the land tax to the peasants. In 1869, the foreign priest Qin Fuchen of Sichuan Province massacred more than 200 Chinese people, including Zhao Yonglin, and finally left. When the Sino-French War broke out in 1884, the French church in Guangxi openly colluded with bandits to carry out espionage activities. In essence, the church had become an important stronghold for invading China. Over the past 100 years, there have been countless bloody and tearful events. The above examples are only a small part. Any patriotic Chinese should never and cannot forget them.
　　The broad masses of the Chinese people have recognized that imperialism uses the church to carry out aggression, and foreign missionaries are the vanguard of aggression. Therefore, church affairs have occurred in various places one after another. At that time, the masses of people across the country everywhere "killed priests and destroyed churches," which was precisely the just anti-aggression movement of the Chinese people. From the Opium War in 1840 to 1900, more than 60 church affairs occurred across the country. Among them, the major ones were the Guangxi church affair in 1856, which became an excuse for the Anglo-French allied forces to organize and force the signing of the Treaty of Tianjin. The Juye church affair in Shandong in 1897 became the reason for Germany to lease Jiaozhou Bay. The Taiwan church affair in 1868, the Xiyang church affair in 1869, the Yichang church affair in 1891, and the Chengdu church affair in 1895 all had British, American, French and other countries' warships arbitrarily rampaging in our country's inland rivers and seas, and landing for exercises and demonstrations. In these church affairs, 1,500 Chinese people died or were injured directly, and the number of indirect deaths and injuries was impossible to count. The Qing court spent more than 1.8 million taels of silver in compensation and condolences, and the direct enclosure of land and extortion were not included. The largest church affair was the Tianjin church affair in 1870. The cause was that the French Ren Ci Tang abducted men and women and buried young children, which aroused public outrage and demanded entry into the church for inspection. This anti-imperialist struggle was purely a mass movement, but the executioner Zeng Guofan killed 20 people, including Feng Cripple, and sent 25 people, including Wang Wu, into exile in order to please imperialism. As a result, the people across the country all called Zeng Guofan a traitor. Even his fellow villagers in Hunan took down the plaque at the Hunan Guild Hall that praised his merits and broke it into ashes. He himself could not but admit that "he was ashamed of public opinion abroad and guilty of conscience, which was a regret in his life," and finally died in the voices of the people across the country saying that he should be killed.
　　After more than 100 years of heroic struggle, we have finally been liberated. In particular, in the past two years, we have achieved great victories in politics, economy, culture, and military affairs. In order to consolidate and expand the victory of our motherland and to protect the happy life we have already obtained, we must never allow imperialism to enjoy all privileges in our country again, and we must not allow imperialism to continue to carry out aggression against our country through religious means. Father Zhang Jizhong of Tianjin said when participating in the reform movement: "If the Chinese had all believed in Catholicism in the past, imperialism could have turned China into their colony without any effort." This is truly a sincere expression of personal painful experience. During the Anti-Japanese War, the international spy Father Lei Zhenyuan established a special agent organization in the John Brothers Association in Anguo County, Hebei Province, and used the treatment of wounded soldiers as a name to collect intelligence. In 1938, Lei went to Hankou to meet with the bandit Chiang Kai-shek and was ordered to organize the North China Battlefield Supervision and Guidance People's Service Corps, widely recruiting believers, passing through Sichuan, Shaanxi to southern Shanxi, and specializing in special agent activities.
　　During the Liberation War, they intensified their special agent activities. In 1947, the Xianxian Zhangjiazhuang spy case cracked by our public security organs in central Hebei Province revealed that the principal offender Shang Jianxun secretly set up a secret radio station to contact Maude, an intelligence officer of the United States stationed in Tianjin, and reported various confidential intelligence of the liberated areas, and colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to attack the liberated areas.
　　As for the famous special agent leader and war criminal Yu Bin, who obtained a doctorate in political science from the Italian fascist bandit gang, this American lackey helped Chiang Kai-shek oppose the Chinese people when Chiang Kai-shek carried out the ten-year anti-people civil war. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, Yu Bin founded the "Catholic Cultural Advancement Association" in Nanjing, attempting to establish branches in 130 dioceses across the country, so that Catholicism across the country would be controlled by American forces.
　　In February of this year, the cases of the "Catholic Patriotic Corps" and the "People's Nation-Building Advancement Association" were also cracked in Tianjin. These were formed in 1946 by the special agent Lei Zhenyuan after being summoned by the Chiang Kai-shek special agent leader Dai Li, and the secret agent of the bandit Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, Catholic Diao Huarin, and others. The "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" had branches in five provinces and two cities in North China, and each branch and its subordinate organizations had a guiding priest. The "Catholic Patriotic Corps" specialized in collecting intelligence on the liberated areas for the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs and carrying out assassinations and "defection" work. In addition, the Tianjin Public Security Bureau recently accepted the request of teachers and students of Jin Gu University and Catholic friends and arrested Bu Xiangxian, vice president of the university, Bao Yihua, dean of the School of Engineering, and Fang Ruhui, dean of the School of Commerce, three foreign priests. They all used the identity of missionaries to privately hide radio stations, report to the enemy, and directly be directed by American special agent Maude to carry out sabotage against the liberation cause of the Chinese people. They once slandered the Catholic reform movement as "apostasy" and "going to hell." They consistently spread deceptive lies that Catholicism is "above politics" and "above international affairs," and that "there is no connection with imperialism, so there is no so-called severing of connections." Now everything has been exposed. They have neither "transcended" the politics of destroying China, nor "transcended" the politics of serving American imperialism. They use the guise of God to engage in espionage activities, and there is nothing more shameful than them.
　　Much has been said, and there are countless ugly things like these that cannot be said enough. Which one is not ironclad evidence that imperialism used Catholicism to carry out aggression? Therefore, patriotic and religious Catholic friends across the country unanimously realized that Catholicism must be reformed. In other words, if Catholicism intends to continue to spread in China, it must first eliminate the imperialist elements within the church, sever all ties with imperialism, and further eliminate all the poisons left by imperialism in the minds of believers. Otherwise, the broad masses of people across the country will not understand us. Today, continuing to allow imperialism to use the church to carry out aggression directly endangers the interests of the people across the country. Therefore, today the reform of Catholicism is no longer a purely internal matter of the church, but a social issue for Catholic friends to maintain the purity of Catholicism and cut off contact with imperialism.
　　The facts are in front of us. Reform is beneficial to the church and the people. On the contrary, it will endanger the country, Catholicism itself, and every believer and priest. So which path should we take? Undoubtedly, everyone is willing to stand in the great ranks of defending the motherland and building the motherland with the people across the country. It is precisely because of this request that patriotic people within our church initiated the Catholic reform movement. Since patriotic bishops, priests, and believers in Sichuan, Jiangxi, and other places issued reform declarations, more than 60 places across the country have responded so far, launching a surging reform movement. This shows that the reform movement represents the wishes of the broad masses of believers, and many believers have already awakened. This great and just movement will surely win the support of Catholic friends across the country and will surely be victorious!
　　Our Catholic friends in Tianjin naturally also realize the great significance of this movement, so they issued a reform declaration on January 13th of this year. After a fierce struggle with imperialist elements and their lackeys, the reform movement has been supported by Vicar General Zhao Zhenya and Hui Ruyu, Li Depei, Zhang Jizhong, Yang Rang, Wang Sixian, Li Futing, Liu Zhiyi and other priests and presidents of various churches, as well as the support of the broad masses of believers and citizens. Now, more than 15,000 people have signed the reform declaration. The reform movement has achieved preliminary success.
　　In order to consolidate our achievements and do a good job in the future, we officially established the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association on April 7th of this year. At the founding meeting, we summarized the work of the past three months, determined the future work policy, adopted the articles of association of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Promotion Association, elected the members of the promotion association, and vowed to completely sever all ties with imperialism. After the meeting, many churches and believers in other places sent us letters and telegrams expressing their support and encouragement and willingness to join hands with us to fight. We should thank them for their concern. In the course of the movement, we deeply felt that our strength is great. Because we are a just cause, we have the support of all believers. The strength of the Chinese people is great and invincible. With the support of the Chinese people, we will be victorious in everything. I believe that we will definitely achieve greater success.
　　Recently, Catholic friends in various places in Tianjin have held several large and small symposiums and will continue to hold them. We are liberated, let the believers cleanly spit out the bitterness that has been suppressed in their hearts for many years, expose the ugly faces of imperialism, and settle the general accounts with them. We are determined to expel all imperialist elements and anti-communist running dogs! We are determined to save the Holy Church contaminated by imperialism, and we are determined to carry out the independent reform movement to the end!
　　We are preparing to hold a large-scale anti-American and aid-Korea parade in Tianjin on the 22nd of this month. Let imperialism tremble before us!
　　Secondly, I am prepared to talk about popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, supporting the conclusion of a peace pact, and firmly opposing the arming of Japan.
　　On March 14th, the China People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association issued a notice calling on the whole country to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. On April 5th, it issued another notice on signing in support of the conclusion of a peace pact and voting against the arming of Japan.
　　Since the great Resist America, Aid Korea movement began, the people of all strata across the country, regardless of occupation or belief, have actively plunged into the movement. In the past few months, great results have been achieved. Its influence is so profound and great. After the education of this movement, the awareness of the people across the country has generally improved a step, greatly changing the inferiority complex formed under the oppression of imperialism in the past 100 years, and promoting national self-esteem and self-confidence. Our Catholic reform movement has also developed on this basis. The Resist America, Aid Korea work is currently and will be the most important work in our country for a considerable period of time. Of course, it is also the most important work for our Catholic friends. People of other strata should popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Because we have been most deeply poisoned by the ideological toxins spread by imperialism in the past, and at the same time, the movement within our religious circles is not as developed as in other strata, therefore, the issue of deepening and popularization is more necessary and more responsible for us. How to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement within Catholicism? It is to strengthen our study, strengthen our publicity, accuse imperialism of the crime of using Catholicism to carry out aggression, further promote the reform movement, sever all ties with imperialism, and completely eliminate all the influence of imperialism within Catholicism.
　　Another concrete work of Resist America, Aid Korea is to sign in support of the conclusion of a peace pact and vote against the arming of Japan. This is a concrete action to safeguard peace in Asia and the world. This is the bounden duty of the peace-loving Chinese people; we are the brave soldiers of Jesus, and we should stand at the forefront.
　　The Chinese people have suffered the most and deepest crimes from Japanese imperialism. Starting from the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the blood debts owed to us by Japanese imperialism are countless. In the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War alone, the Chinese people sacrificed more than 10 million people and lost more than 10 million trillion RMB worth of property. Blood feuds are unforgettable forever. Can the Chinese people willingly let American imperialism rearm Japan?
　　Because we have lived a miserable life of cattle and horses for a long time, we understand the preciousness of peace and the importance of peace even more today after our victory. Jesus said: "You should be careful to do what everyone thinks is beautiful." Thousands upon thousands of people around the world need peace and oppose war. We Catholics should join them in signing and voting to crush the imperialist aggression plot and defend world peace. We pray for peace every day, and today is the time for us to fulfill the true spirit of Jesus Christ's love for people and saving the world with practical actions.
　　To do this work well, much hard publicity and organizational work is still needed. Especially within our Catholicism, imperialism still has considerable power. They are not reconciled to failure. They will continue to sabotage. They will continue to fight as cornered beasts. Therefore, we Catholic friends should make special efforts and be especially vigilant. All the Chinese priests and believers unite with the Chinese people and the people of the world, and world peace will surely be victorious, the Chinese people will surely be victorious, and the reform of Catholicism will surely be victorious!
　　All Catholic friends of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Promotion Association are willing to rise up and act vigorously with Catholic friends from all over the country, encourage each other, expel imperialist forces, eliminate imperialist influence, promote the Holy Church, and build a new China!

　　天津市天主教革新运动促进会主任委员吴克斋
    在中央人民广播电台的广播词全国同胞和天主教教友们：
    今天我预备和大家谈谈天主教的革新和在天主教徒中普及与深入抗美援朝运动，展开拥护缔结和平公约，及反对武装日本的投票运动问题。大家知道的比我丰富，我愿追随在大家之后努力以实际行动做好工作，进一步兴起我们热爱祖国和保卫世界和平的高潮。
    我们中国是一个强大独立的国家了。随着国家的强大，天主教在中国才有条件来洗净过去的污点，才有机会来使全国三百五十万天主教友进入广大人民的行列，来共同建设我们的祖国。大家要认清楚，鸦片战争以后，帝国主义用大炮把大批外国传教士送入我国，一百多年来，天主教就一直是帝国主义利用为侵略我国的一个重要工具。他们以武力侵略我国，强迫我国订立不平等条约，侵占我国主权，欺压我国人民，特别是奴化毒害我国教友的思想，使之忘掉祖国，崇拜外洋，分不清那是天主的教义，那是帝国主义的毒药，甚而模糊了“神权”与“人权”的界限，听任他们奴役宰割而不自知。
    翻开中国近百年史，我们可以看到外国在中国的所谓传教事业从一开始便和他们政府的对华侵略，有着难解难分的关系。不平等条约上明文记载着“传教特权”的条款，这是不可辩驳的事实；而这些不平等条约有许多又是所谓“中国通”的传教士参与其事，阴谋策划的。教士们在中国霸占田产，包揽诉讼，欺压百姓，干涉内政，真是气焰万丈，无所不为。一八六○年满清政府与法国增订条约，当时当翻译的法国教士竟私添了“准法国宣教师在各省租买田地，建造自便”，清政府昏愦糊涂，签字承认。一八六七年法国洪主教移行四川省官员，铸用关防开用。一八六八年贵州主教胡傅理竟送给清朝“保送道员”的照会。一八九九年北京法国主教范国翰与满清总理衙门订立待遇教士的办法，把“主教与督抚平行，管堂暨总司铎与司道平行，司铎与府县平行”，中国官吏要按照司铎的等级分别答拜。山东传教士也有以一省最高长官自居，自称巡抚的。这种“铸用关防”，“保送道员”，“自称巡抚”的狂妄态度，不是把中国完全看成了殖民地是什么？中法条约以后，依照还堂的规定，外国教士，到各省地方，抵还教堂，一时江苏、江西、湖北、四川、直隶、山东、山西、陕西、河南、奉天、广东……，各地都发生过教士以还堂名义霸占田产的事件。他们的方法很多，如法国教士在淮安强买民房，英国教士在福州乌木山圈占公地，美国教士在登州强租民房。长占了房地以后，既不过割，又不输粮，把田赋完全转嫁到农民身上。一八六九年四川外籍神甫覃辅臣屠杀中国人民赵永林等二百余人，末了一走了事。一八八四年中法战争发生时，广西法国教堂公然勾引匪徒，进行特务活动。实质上，教堂已经成为侵略中国的一个重要据点。百余年来，无数血泪斑斑的事迹，以上所举，不及万一，我们任何一个爱国的中国人是永远也不应该和不能忘记的。
    中国广大人民已经认识帝国主义利用教会进行侵略，而外国教士就是侵略的先锋。因此各地相继发生教案，当时全国各地人民群众到处“杀教士，毁教堂”，正是中国人民正义的反侵略运动。从一八四○年鸦片战争起到一九○○年这六十多年间，全国各地发生教案不下六十几起，其中重大的如一八五六年的广西教案，成为英法联军组织的借口，强迫签订天津条约。一八九七年的山东巨野教案，成为德国租借胶澳的理由。一八六八年台湾教案，一八六九年西阳教案，一八九一年宜昌教案，一八九五年成都教案，都有英、美、法等国兵舰任意在我国内河内海横行，并登陆演习示威。这些教案中直接死伤的中国人民有一千五百人，间接死伤的无法统计，清庭赔偿和抚恤耗去库银一百八十多万两，而直接的圈地和勒索尚不在内。教案中最大的是一八七○年的天津教案，起因是法国仁慈堂迷拐男女，埋葬幼孩，引起人民公愤，要求入堂检查。这一次反帝斗争，纯粹是一个群众运动，但刽子手曾国藩为了讨好帝国主义，竟把冯瘸子等二十人杀死，王五等二十五人发配充军，结果全国人民都同声叫曾国藩为卖国贼，连他的湖南同乡也把他在湖南会馆夸耀功名的匾额，摘下来打碎烧成灰了。他自己也不能不承认“外惭清议，内疚神明，为一生憾事”，终于在国人皆曰可杀声中死去。
    经过了百余年来的英勇斗争，今天我们终于解放了，特别二年来无论政治上、经济上、文化上、军事上都已取得了巨大的胜利。为了巩固和扩大我们祖国的胜利，为了保障我们已经获得的幸福的生活，我们绝不能容许帝国主义再在我国享有一切特权，更不能容许帝国主义利用宗教方面继续进行对我国的侵略。天津张济众神父在这次参加革新运动中曾说：“如果中国人在从前都奉了天主教的话，帝国主义可以不用丝毫力量，就将中国变为他们的殖民地。”真是切身惨痛经验的真切流露。抗日战争期间，国际间谍雷振远神父，在河北安国县约翰兄弟会成立了特务组织，借医治伤兵为名，刺探情报。一九三八年雷氏到汉口见蒋匪介石，受命组织了华北战地督导民众服务团，广招教徒，经四川、陕西到晋南（山西南部），专搞特务活动。
    解放战争期中，他们更加紧了特务活动。一九四七年冀中我公安机关破获的献县张家庄间谍案，主犯尚建勋私设秘密电台，与美国驻天津情报人员毛德联系，报告解放区的各种机密情报，并勾引蒋介石匪帮进攻解放区。
    至于有名的特务头子战犯于斌，得过意大利法西斯匪帮的政治学博士，这个美国奴才在蒋匪介石进行十年反人民内战时，就帮助蒋介石反对中国人民。抗日战争结束后，于斌在南京创立“天主教文化协进会”，企图在全国一百三十个教区中成立分会，使全国天主教都为美国势力所把持。
    今年二月在天津又破获了“公教报国团”和“民众建国协进会”的案子，是特务雷振远奉蒋匪特务头子戴笠召见后，与匪保密局特务、天主教徒刁化仁等于一九四六年组成的。“公教青年报国团”在华北五省二市都有分团，每个分团及其下的组织都有指导司铎。“公教报国团”专门为美、蒋匪帮搜集解放区情报，并进行暗杀，“策反”工作。此外最近天津公安局接受津沽大学师生及天主教友要求，逮捕了该校副校长卜相贤，工学院长鲍翊华，商学院长房如晦三外籍神甫。他们都是以传教士的身份，私藏电台，与敌通报，直接受美国特务毛德指挥，进行破坏中国人民的解放事业。他们曾污蔑天主教的革新运动为“叛教”，“下地狱”，他们一贯散布天主教是“超政治”“超国际”，“和帝国主义没有联系，自无所谓割断联系”等欺人谎言，现在一切都揭穿了。他们既没有“超”破坏中国的政治，也没有“超”为美帝国主义服务的政治。他们以天主的幌子干间谍的勾当，再也没有比他们更可耻的了。
    话已讲得不少，诸如此类说不清道不完的丑事，那一样不是帝国主义利用天主教进行侵略的铁证呢？因此，全国各地爱国爱教的教友不约而同地认识到天主教必须革新，换句话说，天主教在中国如果打算继续传下去，首先要铲除教内的帝国主义分子，并割断与帝国主义的一切联系，更进一步地使教友们从思想上肃清帝国主义所留下的一切毒素。不然的话，全国广大人民也不会谅解我们的。今天继续容许帝国主义利用教会进行侵略，那就直接危害了全国人民的利益。因此，今天天主教的革新已不单纯是教内问题，而是天主教的教友为维护天主教的纯洁，斩断与帝国主义联系的社会问题了。
    事实摆在面前，革新对教对人民都有利，反之，就要危害国家危害天主教本身，危害每个教友，神长。那么我们应该走那条路呢？无疑的大家都愿意与全国人民一道站在保卫祖国，建设祖国的伟大行列里。也正是有了这个要求，我们教内爱国人士才发起了天主教的革新运动。自从四川、江西等地的爱国主教、神长、教友们发表革新宣言后，跟着全国各地响应的截至现在已有六十几处，展开了风起云涌的革新运动。这说明了革新运动是代表广大教友愿望的，不少教友已经觉悟了。这个伟大的正义的运动，一定会取得全国教友的拥护，一定会取得胜利！
    我们天津市教友们自然也认识到这个运动伟大的意义，所以在今年一月十三日发出了革新宣言，经过与帝国主义分子及其走狗的剧烈斗争，革新运动已经得到了赵振亚副主教和回如愚、李德培、张济众、杨让、王思贤、李辅庭、刘志伊等各位神长及各堂口的会长的赞助，以及广大教友和市民的支援。现在，在革新宣言上签名的已有一万五千余名。革新运动获得了初步的成就。
    为了巩固我们的成就，作好今后的工作，我们在今年四月七日正式成立了天津天主教革新运动促进会。成立大会上我们总结了三个月来的工作，确定了今后工作方针，通过了天津市天主教革新促进会章程，选举了促进会的委员，并宣誓彻底割断与帝国主义的一切联系。开会以后，其他各地的许多教会，教友们，给我们来信和电报表示支持与鼓励，愿意和我们共同携手奋斗。我们应该感谢他们的关怀。在运动过程中，我们深深地感到我们的力量是伟大的。因为我们是正义的事业，有一切教友支援我们，中国人民的力量是伟大而无敌的，我们有了中国人民的支援，我们无往而不胜利，我相信，我们定会得到更大的成就。
    最近天津各处教友已经召开了好几次大、小型的座谈会，还要继续召开。我们解放了，让教友们干干净净吐吐压在心底多少年来的苦水吧，揭露帝国主义的丑恶的面目吧！和他们算算总账，我们决心要把一切帝国主义分子反共走狗驱逐出去！我们决心要把帝国主义所沾污的圣教拯救过来，我们决心要把自立革新运动进行到底！
    本月二十二日我们准备举行天津天主教抗美援朝大游行。让帝国主义在我们面前发抖吧！
    其次，我准备谈谈普及与深入抗美援朝运动，拥护缔结和平公约，坚决反对武装日本的问题。
    三月十四日中国人民抗美援朝总会发表通告，号召全国普及与深入抗美援朝运动。四月五日又发表签名拥护缔结和平公约，反对武装日本投票的通知。
    自伟大的抗美援朝运动开始以来，我全国人民，一切阶层，不分职业，不分信仰，都积极地投身到运动中来。几个月来，已经收到很大成效。它的影响是如此深巨，经过了这个运动的教育，全国人民的觉悟都普遍提高了一步，大大改变了近百年来在帝国主义压迫下形成的自卑心理，发扬了民族自尊心和自信心。我们天主教的革新运动，也就是在这个基础上发展起来的。抗美援朝工作是目前也是今后相当时期内我们国家内最重大的工作，当然也是我们天主教教友的最重大的工作。别的阶层人民应该普及与深入抗美援朝。因为我们过去受帝国主义所散播的思想毒素最深，同时在我们宗教界内比起别的阶层运动还不够开展，因此深入与普及问题对我们来说，就更其必要和更其责任重大了。怎样在天主教内普及和深入抗美援朝呢？就是加强我们的学习，加强我们的宣传，控诉帝国主义利用天主教进行侵略的罪恶，进一步推进革新运动，割断与帝国主义的一切联系，彻底肃清帝国主义在天主教内的一切影响。
    抗美援朝另一件具体工作，就是签名拥护缔结和平公约和投票反对武装日本。这是维护亚洲和世界和平的具体行动。这是爱好和平的中国人民义不容辞的；我们是耶稣的勇兵，我们应该站到最前列。
    中国人民受日本帝国主义的罪最深最多。从马关条约开始，日本帝国主义欠下我们的血债是数不清、数不尽的。仅仅抗战八年，中国人民就牺牲了一千万以上，损失了一千万亿人民币以上的财产。血海深仇，永世难忘，中国人民能甘心让美帝国主义重新武装日本吗？
    因为我们长期过着牛马的苦难日子，今天胜利了，我们更懂得和平的珍贵，更懂得和平的重要。耶稣说：“众人以为美的事，你应该留心去做。”全世界千千万万人都需要和平，反对战争，我们天主教人士就应该和他们一齐参加签名，参加投票，粉碎帝国主义侵略阴谋，保卫世界和平。我们天天都祈祷和平，今天正是我们以实际行动履行天主耶稣爱人救世真精神的时候。
    做好这一工作，还需要许多艰苦的宣传工作和组织工作，尤其是我们天主教内部，帝国主义还有相当的势力，他们不甘心失败，他们将继续破坏，他们还要作困兽斗，所以我们天主教教友应该特别努力，特别提高警惕。全体的中国神长们、教友们团结一致和全中国人民在一起，和全世界人民在一起，世界和平一定胜利，中国人民一定胜利，天主教的革新也一定胜利！
    我们天津天主教革新促进会全体教友愿与全国各地教友奋起力行，互励互勉，驱逐帝国主义势力，肃清帝国主义影响，广扬圣教，建设新中国！
