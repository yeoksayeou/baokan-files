    Look, This is How Landlords Trample on Peasant Women!
    Record of Yu Huiling's Accusation Against Her Father

    To the Editorial Comrades:
    During the Zhengzhou Telecommunications Bureau's anti-revolutionary accusation meeting, Yu Huiling (female member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League), a telephone operator at the bureau, made accusations against her landlord tyrant father. Below is an excerpt from her accusation.

    My father's name is Yu Huiwu. He is from Liudukou Village, Xiping, Henan Province, and is a landlord tyrant. From his life, we can see how a landlord element oppresses and tramples on peasant women. Yu Huiwu did not love my mother, because landlord elements simply do not understand true love. He was mixed up with a female rogue named Liu Jichun outside. One night, as heavy snow fell, Yu Huiwu, after indulging in opium, suddenly stood up from the bed, pointed a pistol at my mother's head and said, "Get out! If you don't get out, I'll shoot you dead immediately!" My mother was so frightened that she knelt on the ground begging for mercy. As a result, she was severely beaten by him, but he still demanded that she leave within three days.

    After Yu Huiwu fooled around with Liu Jichun for a period of time, he bought a young peasant woman named Huang Sini from a neighboring village. Since Huang Sini came to my house, my mother and I were even more abused. My mother was forced to attempt suicide, but fortunately, she was discovered early and saved. However, Yu Huiwu glared and said, "Suicide, very good, that's exactly what I want!" Even more unreasonably, he scolded the neighbors, saying they shouldn't meddle in other people's business.

    More than a year later, Yu JinSheng’s daughter—Yu Ni—was also eyed by Yu Huiwu, and he forcibly demanded the girl from Yu Jinsheng. The tenant Yu Jinsheng pleaded, "Masters, please spare me! We only have this one girl in our family. She's only seventeen this year, too young, and doesn't know how to serve masters." Upon hearing this, Yu Huiwu became angry. He said, "Do you still want to live? If you don't give me Yu Ni as a maid, I'll settle accounts with you immediately. You're farming my land, and you owe me a lot of rent. Otherwise, I'll break your dog legs!" The tenant was forced to send his daughter into the fire pit. After Yu Ni came to my house, she was constantly beaten and bullied, even beaten to the point of rolling on the ground.

    A year later, the shameless Yu Huiwu could not restrain his animalistic nature and finally raped the little girl. The peasant's daughter could not bear this kind of humiliation and wanted to escape. Yu Huiwu locked her in the house and continued to take pleasure in the suffering of others. Thus, this little girl was devastated and became pregnant and died in childbirth. Afterwards, Yu Huiwu even told his family, "If anyone

    看，地主就是这样蹂躏农民妇女的！
    记于惠玲对她父亲的控诉编辑同志：
    郑州电信局举行反革命控诉大会时，该局话务员于惠玲（中国新民主主义青年团女团员），对她的恶霸地主父亲进行了控诉。下边是摘记她控诉中的一部分。
    我的父亲叫于徽五。河南西平刘渡口村人，是一个恶霸地主。从他的生活中，我们可以看出一个地主分子是怎样的压迫蹂躏了农民妇女。于徽五并不爱我的母亲，这是因为地主分子根本就不懂得真正的爱情。他在外边和一个女流氓刘季春混在一起。一天夜里，天下着大雪，于徽五一个劲地吸足了大烟，猛然从床上站起来，把手枪对着我母亲的头说：“你滚出去，你要不滚，我马上就打死你。”吓得我母亲跪在地上求饶。结果遭了他一顿毒打，还是要我母亲在三天内滚出去。
    于徽五和刘季春鬼混了一个时期后，又在邻村买了一个名叫黄四妮的青年农民妇女。自从黄四妮来到我家以后，我母女俩人就更受虐待了。我母亲被逼得去寻短见，幸为别人发现得早，才救下了命。但于徽五却在一边瞪着眼说：“寻死，很好，这正投我的心意。”更无理的是他又把邻居们骂了一顿，说他们不该多管闲事。
    过了一年多以后，佃户于金生的姑娘—于妮又被于徽五看上了，他就向于金生强要这姑娘。佃户于金生哀求说：“大爷们，你们饶了我吧，我们三门就这一个姑娘。她今年才十七岁，年纪太小，还不会侍候老爷们。”于徽五一听就翻了脸，他说：“你还想活不想活？你不把于妮给我做丫头，我马上和你算账。你种我的地，欠我的租子还多着呢，再不然我就打断你的狗腿！”佃户被逼的没法子，只好将自己的女儿送入火坑。于妮来到我家后，不断地挨打受气，甚至被打得满地打滚。
    再过了一年，不要脸的于徽五就耐不住兽性了，终于把这个小姑娘强奸了。农民的女儿不堪忍受此种耻辱，就想逃跑。于徽五就把她关在屋里，继续以别人的痛苦来取乐。就这样，这小姑娘被遭塌的怀孕了；并因生产而葬送了性命。事后于徽五还对家人说：“谁要是走漏了风声，我就杀了谁。”
