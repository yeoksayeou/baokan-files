Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

To the Editors:

Regarding Comrade Gu Jiancheng's criticism in the February 25th "Letters from Readers" column of your newspaper regarding my failure to rely on the working class, I offer the following self-criticism:

　　(1) In the year after liberation, due to my own low level of awareness, I mistakenly believed that the tiered contact method—production team leaders contacting workers, department heads contacting production team leaders, and the factory director contacting department heads—was very complete. Consequently, I never thought that the factory director should also go deep into the lower levels, which is the fundamental reason for my insufficient understanding of the workers.

　　(2) The repair factory's industrial and administrative organizations were both established in the year after liberation. During this process, objective circumstances such as insufficient manpower and unfamiliarity with the work further promoted my tendencies toward事務ism and bureaucratism.

　　(3) Because I did not actively contact the trade union, there was an inconsistent phenomenon of administration only focusing on production while the trade union emphasized welfare.

Because I lived in the old society for a long time, I have not yet studied the new methods of managing enterprises sufficiently. I sincerely accept the People's Daily's criticism of me and am determined to strengthen my studies in the future to better improve myself.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　中南有色金属管理总局江西分局修造       
    厂厂长张挽中对不依靠工人阶级的检讨编辑同志：
    顾建成同志在二月二十五日贵报《读者来信》栏批评我不依靠工人阶级的问题，我作如下检讨：
    （一）在解放后的一年中，由于自己觉悟不高，错误地认为：由生产小组长联系工人，部门主管人联系生产小组长，厂长联系部门主管人的分层联系办法很完善。因而竟没想到厂长也应该深入下层，这就是我对工人了解不够的基本原因。
    （二）修造厂工务与行政组织都是在解放后的一年中建立起来的。在这个过程中，因为人力不够、工作生疏等客观情况，更加促进了我的事务主义和官僚主义作风。
    （三）由于我没有主动地和工会联系，因而形成行政只顾生产，工会强调福利的步调不一致现象。
    因为我在旧社会生活了很久，对于新的管理企业的方法还学习得很不够。我诚恳地接受人民日报对我的批评，决心在以后加强学习，更好地提高自己。
