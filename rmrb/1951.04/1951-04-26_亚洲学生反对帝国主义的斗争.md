　　Asian Students' Struggle Against Imperialism
　　In Asia, students from various countries oppressed by imperialism are, together with the people of their own countries, strengthening the unity of their ranks, opposing imperialist aggression and enslavement education, opposing imperialism's transformation of their motherlands into bases for aggressive war, and opposing the United States' rearmament of Japan.
　　In Korea, American imperialism launched a war of aggression, razing peaceful towns and villages, schools and libraries to the ground, and massacring tens of thousands of women and children. In the Korean people's just struggle against American imperialism, Korean youth and students bravely participated in the battle to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland and to defend peace in Asia and the world. They enthusiastically responded to the call of Korean people's leader General Kim Il-sung: "Everything for the front, everything for victory." On the third day after the outbreak of the war, 2,600 of the 3,100 students at Kim Il-sung University signed up for the front, and more than 90 percent of all students at universities and middle schools requested to join the army. South Korean youth and students joined the guerrillas and launched extensive attacks, cutting off enemy transportation everywhere and inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. This spring, Korean students, along with urban young workers and staff, organized spring plowing shock brigades and went to the countryside to assist farmers in spring plowing, striving to realize the slogan put forward by rural youth: "Do not waste an inch of land, increase grain production, and support the front." The just struggle of Korean students has won the sympathy and support of democratic students and youth around the world from the very beginning. Chinese students and youth have also taken voluntary actions to support the Chinese People's Volunteers in their resistance against America and aid to Korea, dealing a heavy blow to American imperialism.
　　In Vietnam, students are participating en masse in the Vietnamese people's liberation struggle and, together with the people of the whole country, are actively responding to the call to "prepare for the general counter-offensive" in order to finally drive out the French imperialists. In battle, students have shown heroic spirit. For example, in the defense of Hai Duong City, student Deng Guozheng used bombs to blast enemy fortifications, sacrificing himself to achieve victory in the battle. Countless medical students have organized medical teams to support the front and serve the soldiers. In the enemy-occupied areas, students are increasingly fiercely fighting against the Bao Dai puppet regime and imperialism. In the liberated areas, students are working hard to learn military techniques and culture, preparing to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. They are also actively participating in the literacy movement to eliminate illiteracy. Ninety percent of the teachers in the literacy classes are young people and students. By the end of 1949, the number of literate people in the country had reached 11.58 million, accounting for more than half of the country's population. In March of this year, the Vietnam Workers' Party announced its establishment, and the Viet Minh and Viet Lien were merged into the Vietnam National United Front. These all marked the growth of the Vietnamese people's strength. Since last year, the Vietnamese people have achieved a series of brilliant victories in the military. Regardless of the frantic interference and intimidation of American imperialism, the Vietnamese people's patriotic war will make greater progress, and their "victory in 1951 will be even greater than the victory in 1950."
　　In Japan, students' patriotic movement against American imperialism and its running dog, the Yoshida traitorous government, is rising. Recently, because American imperialism has suffered a shameful defeat in its aggression in Korea, it has attempted to engage in a separate peace treaty with Japan and prepare to rearm Japan, putting it on the bandwagon of American imperialism. This conspiracy of American imperialism has been resolutely opposed by the Japanese people and students. Now, the movement against a separate peace treaty with Japan and the rearmament of Japan has spread throughout the country. Students in large and small cities such as Tokyo and Kyoto have participated in rallies, discussions, and forums, and they have also participated in a widespread signature campaign against the rearmament of Japan. By the beginning of March, students and workers in Kyoto had collected 300,000 signatures. The number of signatures in Tokyo reached 500,000 in February. At the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tohoku University, Kiryu Women's High School in Gunma Prefecture, and many other schools, public opinion polls were held on the rearmament of Japan. The results reflected that the majority of Japanese students opposed the rearmament of Japan and demanded a comprehensive peace treaty. At present, this movement is developing vigorously despite various persecutions by the reactionaries.
　　Over the past year, Indian students have also carried out a series of struggles to strive for peace and democracy, oppose the government's closure of schools and dismissal of professors, oppose increased tuition fees, and oppose various persecution measures. They have expressed their determination to oppose imperialism and defend peace with active actions. When collecting signatures for the Stockholm Peace Appeal, students in Bombay collected 42,000 signatures within five days. Indian students hate the imperialist acts of aggression in Asia, and some have expressed their willingness to go to Korea to resist the invaders. For example, recently, twelve students from Khalsa College in East Punjab Province and fifty young people from Bombay have expressed their desire to go to Korea to support the Korean people. Indian students have expressed great anger and lodged serious protests against American imperialism's rearmament of Japan, regarding it as a springboard for aggression against the people of Asian countries.
　　In Burma and Indonesia, students are taking increasingly active actions to oppose imperialism and strive for complete national independence. Burmese students stand closely with the people and participate in various practical struggles, tempering themselves in the struggles.
　　In Thailand, the deep national disasters caused by the tyranny of Luang Phibuns and the aggression of American imperialism have gradually awakened Thai youth and students. The student movement, led by Thammasat University, has developed from a struggle against unequal treatment and striving for their own immediate interests to a political struggle against new wars and supporting world peace. After the Stockholm Peace Appeal was issued, it was only through layers of blockade and obstruction that it reached the hands of Thai students and people. The nationwide signature campaign for peace was widely launched in various parts of Thailand from November of last year. More than a thousand students from Thammasat University signed the Stockholm Declaration. Students from Chulalongkorn University also actively responded to the signature campaign. Active members among the students of Thammasat University also organized propaganda teams to go to the countryside during holidays to promote and collect peace signatures. Thai students have expressed their determination to oppose the aggression of American imperialist warmongers and defend peace through concrete actions. They will work hard together with democratic youth from all over the world to strive for lasting world peace and people's democracy.
　　The high tide of the anti-imperialist movement of various Asian nations, especially the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the victory of the Chinese and Korean people's resistance to American imperialist aggression, has greatly strengthened the world's peace and democracy camp and dealt a serious blow to the imperialist warmongers. From the struggle, the Asian people and youth and students have realized that imperialism can be defeated. They will strengthen their unity with a hundredfold confidence and fight to the end for the final victory of the national liberation movement.

　　亚洲学生反对帝国主义的斗争
    在亚洲，受着帝国主义压迫的各国学生，正和自己国家的人民在一起，加强自己队伍的团结，反对帝国主义的侵略和奴化教育，反对帝国主义把自己的祖国变为侵略战争的基地，反对美国重新武装日本。
    在朝鲜，美帝国主义发动了侵略战争，把朝鲜的和平城镇和乡村、学校和图书馆夷成了平地，屠杀了成千成万的妇女和儿童。在朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义的正义斗争中，朝鲜青年学生为了保卫祖国的独立和自由，保卫亚洲与全世界的和平而英勇地参加战斗。他们热烈地响应朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军所发出的“一切为了前线，一切为了胜利”的号召。在战争爆发后第三天，金日成大学的三千一百名学生中有二千六百人报名上了前线，大学和中学全体学生中有百分之九十以上都要求参军。南朝鲜的青年学生则参加了游击队而广泛出击，到处切断敌人的交通，给敌人以重大的打击。今年春天，朝鲜学生又和城市青年工人、职员一道，纷纷组织春耕突击队，下乡协助农民进行春耕，要实现农村青年所提出的“不荒废一寸土地，增产粮食，支援前线”的口号。朝鲜学生的正义斗争从开始的一天起就赢得了全世界民主学生和青年的同情和支援。中国学生和青年更纷纷以志愿的行动支援中国人民抗美援朝志愿部队与朝鲜人民军，给美帝国主义以沉重的打击。
    在越南，学生大批的参加越南人民的解放斗争，并和全国人民一道积极地响应“准备总反攻”的号召，以便最后把法帝国主义者驱逐出去。在战斗中，学生表现了英勇的气概，例如在海阳城的保卫战中，学生邓国征用炸弹轰炸敌人的工事，他牺牲了自己而取得了战役的胜利。无数医科学生则组织医疗队，支援前线，为战士服务。在敌占区里，学生们愈来愈激烈地向保大傀儡政权及帝国主义作斗争。在解放区，学生们努力学习军事技术，学习文化，准备随时响应祖国的号召，他们又积极地参加了扫除文盲的识字运动，识字班的教员百分之九十都是青年和学生，截至一九四九年底全国识字人数已达一千一百五十八万人，占全国人口半数以上。今年三月越南劳动党宣布成立，越盟、越联合并为越南民族联合阵线，这些都标志着越南人民力量的壮大。去年以来，越南人民在军事上已获得一连串的辉煌胜利。不管美帝国主义的疯狂干涉和恫吓，越南人民的爱国战争将获得更大的进展，他们“在一九五一年的胜利将会比一九五○年的胜利更为伟大”。
    在日本，学生们反对美帝国主义及其走狗吉田卖国政府的爱国运动日益高涨。最近，由于美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略遭到可耻的失败，它便企图进行单独对日媾和的勾当，并准备重新武装日本，把它套在美帝国主义的战车上面。美帝国主义的这一阴谋遭受到日本人民和学生的坚决反对。现在，反对单独对日媾和与重新武装日本的运动已普及全国。东京京都等大小城市的学生纷纷参加奋起大会、讨论会、和座谈会，他们又参加广泛的反对重新武装日本的签名运动。京都学生和工人到三月初已征集了三十万签名。东京的签名人数在二月便已达到五十万。在东京工业大学、东北大学、群马县桐生女子高等学校以及其他许多学校都举行了关于重新武装日本的民意测验，结果反映出大多数日本学生都反对重新武装日本，要求全面媾和。目前这一运动正不顾反动派的种种迫害而蓬勃地向前发展。
    一年以来，印度学生也进行了一系列的斗争，争取和平民主，反对政府关闭学校解聘教授，反对增加学费，反对种种的迫害措施，他们以积极的行动表示了他们反对帝国主义与保卫和平的决心。在征集斯德哥尔摩的和平宣言签名时，孟买学生在五天以内就搜集了四万二千个签名。印度学生痛恨帝国主义在亚洲的侵略行为，有些表示愿到朝鲜去抗击侵略者，如最近东旁遮普省卡尔萨大学的十二名学生与孟买的五十名青年都表示要到朝鲜去支援朝鲜的人民。印度学生对于美帝国主义重新武装日本，把它当作侵略亚洲各国人民的跳板，表示极大的愤怒并提出了严重抗议。
    在缅甸和印度尼西亚，学生以日益积极的行动，反对帝国主义，争取完全的民族独立。缅甸学生紧紧地与人民站在一起，参加各种实际斗争，在斗争中锻炼了自己。
    在泰国，由于銮披汶的暴政以及美帝国主义的侵略而引起的深重的民族灾难，已促使泰国的青年学生逐渐觉悟起来。以法政大学为主体的学生运动，已由反对不平等的待遇、争取自己切身利益的斗争发展到反对新战争、拥护世界和平的政治斗争。斯德哥尔摩和平宣言发出以后，通过了层层封锁和阻碍才传到了泰国学生和人民的手里。全国性的征集和平签名运动从去年十一月便在泰国各地普遍展开，法政大学学生千余人都在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名。朱拉隆功大学学生也踊跃地响应签名运动。法政大学学生中的积极分子还组织宣传队，利用假期，下乡宣传征集和平签名。泰国学生已通过具体的行动表示了反对美帝国主义战争贩子的侵略和保卫和平的决心，他们将和世界各国的民主青年一起努力斗争，争取世界的持久和平与人民民主。
    亚洲各民族反对帝国主义运动的高涨，特别是中国人民革命的胜利以及中朝人民反对美帝国主义侵略的胜利，大大地增强了全世界的和平民主阵营，并给予帝国主义战争贩子以严重的打击。从斗争中，亚洲人民和青年学生都认识到，帝国主义是能够被打败的。他们将以百倍的信心，加强团结，为争取民族解放运动的最后胜利而斗争到底。
