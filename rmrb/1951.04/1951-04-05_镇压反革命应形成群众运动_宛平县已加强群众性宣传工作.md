　　Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries Should Form a Mass Movement

Wanping County Has Strengthened Mass Propaganda Work

Editor Comrades:

　　One of the reasons why the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in Wanping County has not formed a mass movement is that the propaganda work has not been done enough. Now the leadership of the county is correcting this deviation.

　　After the Central People's Government announced the Regulations for Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, this county did not deeply promote them to the masses in combination with the local specific conditions. Special agents took the opportunity to spread rumors, intimidate, and deceive the masses.

　　The masses are very supportive of the government's suppression of counter-revolutionaries. For example, when the counter-revolutionary criminals Song Fuzeng, Ping Chaobin, and Shi Tianyue were executed in this county, farmers from fifteen *li* away rushed to participate in the accusation meetings, and held evening parties and parades. However, because many masses do not have a sufficient understanding of the spirit of the Regulations for Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, they dare not boldly expose and report counter-revolutionary elements. When the mass meeting was held in Shangqingshui Village to accuse the crimes of special agent Wang Junde, many masses said: "Don't say too much, be careful not to stir up a hornet's nest."

　　After the leadership of this county discovered this situation, they have made a review and the responsible comrades have separately led the meetings of district and village cadres and propagandists to vigorously strengthen the propaganda work for the masses.

### 镇压反革命应形成群众运动  宛平县已加强群众性宣传工作

　　镇压反革命应形成群众运动        
    宛平县已加强群众性宣传工作编辑同志：
    宛平县镇压反革命没有形成群众运动的原因之一，是宣传工作做得不够。现在本县领导上正在纠正这个偏向。
    在中央人民政府公布惩治反革命条例后，本县没有很好结合当地具体情况，向群众深入宣传。特务分子便乘机造谣，恐吓、欺骗群众。
    群众对政府镇压反革命是非常拥护的，如本县枪决反革命罪犯宋福增、平超斌、史天月时，十五里以外的农民都赶来参加控诉大会，并且举行了晚会和游行。但是，很多群众因为对惩治反革命条例的精神不够了解，因此不敢大胆告发、检举反革命分子。上清水村举行群众大会控诉特务王俊德的罪恶时，很多群众说：“别多说话，小心狐狸打不成惹了一身骚。”
    本县领导上发现了这个情况后，已作了检讨，并由负责同志分头领导区、村干部及宣传员会议，以大力加强对群众的宣传工作。
