　　Accusation Against Christian Scoundrel Gu Ren'en
　　Qiao Weixiong, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Christian Reformation Promotion Committee

　　Gu Ren'en is a disgrace to Christianity. He once "preached" at the Asbury Church of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Beijing, attracting many young people. I went to listen once, just to see what kind of "exciting evangelist" he was. It turned out that on the stage, he didn't preach the "Word," but promoted that he had been a movie star, acted in "Orchid in the Valley," knew the Shanghai gang leaders, and acted like a bully, saying things like "When a gun is drawn, who isn't afraid?" and "Who doesn't love lavish spending?" Just like the vile and shameless things he confessed to in his own statement, which he considered supremely glorious. In the sacred church, he would arbitrarily bind the pastor presiding over the service, and then untie him, performing a release from demonic bondage to carry out superstitious propaganda. At the time, I felt that this was not preaching, but nonsense!

　　One morning, I met him on Jiaodaokou Street practicing riding a bicycle, supported by several young women, with a very ugly and unsightly demeanor. I immediately advised the fellow members of the Young People's Fellowship not to listen to his "preaching." Not long after, I heard that a mentally ill woman went to Asbury Church to find him, but he avoided her. The woman completely took off all her clothes and was sent to the hospital naked. This incident immediately spread throughout the churches, but no one knew what was going on or why this woman went mad because of him. Now, after seeing the accusation of fellow believer Yang Shaopeng in the Beijing People's Daily on April 20, I learned that the woman was Yang Xiuying, who was raped by Gu Ren'en, leading to her mental breakdown. Even today, that poor fellow sister is still chained to her bed due to Gu's atrocities. Gu Ren'en was a Christian scoundrel with immoral conduct ten years ago. No wonder he was willing to be a pawn of the American spy Mason and engage in counter-revolutionary activities.

　　Secondly, I accuse Gu Ren'en of being an American spy. Last summer, we learned in Tianjin that he was "preaching" at the China Christian Church on Dagu Road, the Wesley Church of the Methodist Episcopal Church on Binjiang Road, the China Christian Church at Cangmenkou, and the China Anglican Church on Jiujiang Road in Tianjin. He was still putting on the same ugly performance, deceiving others, and boasting about himself. Moreover, he even started "curing" "diseases" at Wesley Church. How did he "cure diseases"? For example, if someone was lame, using crutches, they would go to see him for treatment. He would apply oil, have two people hold them up, and drag them out, immediately broadcasting, "The lame one is walking!" In reality, two living people were replacing the two wooden crutches, and the person was still lame when they left the church. If he couldn't cure the disease, he would say that the patient "lacked sincerity." For example, once a blind person went to see him for treatment. After praying and applying oil, he held a watch in his hand and asked the patient, "Can you see what this is?" The patient said, "I can't see." He pushed them away and said, "Go! Go! Lack of sincerity!" When the patient tried to argue, he immediately said, "Sing a hymn! Sing a hymn!" The choir would then all sing together, and the blind patient would be dragged out. Gu Ren'en's "curing diseases" was ineffective, but under his deception, some backward masses were fooled by him. He used this method to willingly act as a running dog for American imperialism and engage in counter-revolutionary activities. The People's Government was completely correct to arrest him. I demand that the government severely punish him to eliminate harm for the people and the church.

　　However, after the news of Gu Ren'en's arrest spread to Tianjin, some spy elements in the church took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying, "Christianity is being persecuted," and "Several thousand people in Shanghai want to bail out Gu Ren'en." They even threatened, "Those who accuse Gu Ren'en are heretics." This caused a small number of backward fellow believers, who had been deceived by him, to be afraid to accuse him and even pray for him. This is a disgrace to our church. We must strengthen our learning, raise our vigilance, and expose the spy elements within the church.

　　控诉基督教败类顾仁恩
    天津基督教革新推进委员会副主席　乔维熊
    顾仁恩是一个基督教的败类。他曾在北京卫理公会亚斯理堂“布道”，前往听“道”的青年人很多。我为了看看他到底是个什么样的“兴奋布道家”，也去听了一次。原来他在台上不是讲“道”，而是宣传他曾当过电影明星，演过《空谷兰》，认识上海的帮会头子们，横行霸道，说什么“手枪出笼，谁人不怕”，“挥金如土，谁人不爱”，像现在在他自己供状中所供的一样下流无耻并认为无上光荣。他在圣洁的礼拜堂内任意捆绑主持礼拜的牧师，然后他再解开，表演从魔鬼捆绑得到释放，进行迷信宣传。当时，我觉得这不是布道，而是胡闹！
    一天早晨，我遇见他在交道口大街练习骑脚踏车，扶着几个青年妇女，态度十分丑恶难看。我当时便劝青年同道团契契友不要去听他讲“道”。过了不久，听说有位患精神病的妇女去亚斯理堂找他，他避面不见，那位妇女竟将身上所穿的衣服完全脱下，赤身露体，被人送到医院里去。这件事立刻传遍了各教会，但是谁也不知道是什么回事，为什么这位妇女会因他发疯。这次看到四月二十日北京人民日报登载杨绍彭同道的控诉，才知道那位妇女就是被顾仁恩强奸以致精神错乱的杨秀英。直到今天，那位可怜的同道姊妹，还因顾匪的残害而被铁链捆在床上。顾仁恩十年前就是品行不端的基督教的败类，无怪乎他甘心作美国特务麦森的爪牙，进行反革命活动了。
    其次，我控诉顾仁恩是一个美国特务分子。去年夏天我们在天津又知道他在天津大沽路中华基督教会，滨江道卫理公会维斯理堂，仓门口中华基督教会和九江路中华圣公会等处布“道”。他还是那样丑态百出，欺骗别人，夸耀自己。而且他竟在维斯理堂“治”起“病”来。他是怎样“治病”呢？比如有一位跛腿的，架着双拐，前去看病。他抹了油，过来两个人一架，便拖了出去，立刻广播说：“跛腿的走路了！”其实是以两个活人代替了两个木拐，那人出了礼拜堂还是跛腿的。他治不好病，就说病人“信心不诚”。比如有一次一位瞎眼的去看病，他祈祷抹油后，手中拿个表，问病人说：“你看这是什么？”病人说：“我看不见。”他就用手一推说：“去！去！信心不诚！”病人要分辩，他就立刻说：“唱诗！唱诗！”唱诗班就大家唱起来，瞎眼的病人被拖了出去。顾仁恩“治病”是不灵的，但在他的欺诈下，部分落后群众却受了他的愚弄。他就是利用这种手段，甘心作美帝国主义的走狗，进行反革命活动。人民政府逮捕他是完全正确的。我要求政府严厉惩办他，为人民为教会除害。
    但是顾仁恩被捕的消息传到天津后，教会里的一些特务分子乘机造谣说：“基督教受迫害了”，“上海有好几千人要保释顾仁恩”。更威肋说：“控诉顾仁恩的就是离经叛道”。致使一小部分落后同道，受过他欺骗的都不敢控诉，甚至为他祈祷。这是我们教会的耻辱。我们要加强学习，提高警惕，检举教会内的特务分子。
