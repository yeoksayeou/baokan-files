Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: Xiong Jinqing, Director of the Chinese People's Relief Committee for Malayan Refugees, answered the following questions raised by a reporter from this agency on the 24th of this month regarding the dispatch of an investigation team to Malaya for Malayan refugees:

Question: What is the progress of the Chinese People's Relief Committee for Malayan Refugees in sending an investigation team to Malaya to investigate the situation of the refugees?

Answer: The Chinese People's Relief Committee for Malayan Refugees telegraphed British Prime Minister Attlee on March 8th, proposing that we go to Malaya to conduct investigations into the work of the refugees. It has been over a month since then, and Attlee has yet to give a formal reply.

Question: British Colonial Secretary Griffiths recently made a statement in the British House of Commons, saying that overseas Chinese in Malaya have "freedom" and "peace," and that he refuses to allow the refugee investigation team to enter Malaya. What is your opinion of this statement?

Answer: Griffiths' statement is utterly absurd. The whole world knows that the British government and the Malayan colonial government authorities, disregarding the great contributions of our more than 2.8 million overseas Chinese in Malaya together with the local people, disregarding international morality, treat our compatriots with savage and brutal bloody massacres, forced migrations, arrests, expulsions, and even barbaric means such as collective imprisonment and collective punishment. Overseas Chinese property has been plundered, houses have been burned, and villages have been swept away. Such atrocities have been openly published in the Malayan British colonial government's own newspapers in lengthy reports. Since June 1948, approximately 40,000 overseas Chinese have been deported, and more than 15,000 people were sent to prison in the past year alone. Griffiths himself admitted as early as last March that "the number of displaced overseas Chinese in Malaya reached 400,000." The reactionary Sing Chew Daily recently revealed that "residents are now facing the threat of homelessness." Overseas Chinese compatriots who have been deported back to China have complained that Malaya has become a prison of death and terror, and a huge number of overseas Chinese have fallen into hunger, cold, separation of wives and children, and the destruction of families.

The Chinese people have dispatched an investigation team to Malaya to find out the suffering of the overseas Chinese there. If Griffiths says that overseas Chinese in Malaya have "freedom" and "peace," then why is the British government afraid of the Chinese people's investigation team going to Malaya to take a look?

Question: Please tell us about the situation of the British Malayan colonial government expelling overseas Chinese and our reception of returned refugees.

Answer: The British Malayan colonial government began large-scale deportations of overseas Chinese back to China in November of last year. In the past four months or so, a total of 3,513 overseas Chinese have been deported back to China, including 2,022 children, women, and elderly people, accounting for more than 57 percent. This is the number of four batches of returning overseas Chinese; there is another batch not included. Our people's government and people's organizations, in order to enable these batches of suffering compatriots to rebuild their homes and live in peace after returning to their motherland, have made arrangements according to their specific circumstances, with some returning to their hometowns to engage in production, and others joining work or study. The refugees feel that the people's motherland is warmly concerned and cares for them.

Question: What is the reaction of overseas Chinese to the dispatch of a refugee investigation team to Malaya?

Answer: It has been supported by the vast number of overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese from various places and returned overseas Chinese in China have sent letters expressing their warm support and hoping that the investigation team will depart as soon as possible. Many overseas Chinese newspapers have published this news and the statement of the Chinese People's Relief Committee for Malayan Refugees in prominent positions, and published commentaries pointing out that the Chinese people's decision and action are completely just and humanitarian; the British government and the Malayan colonial government must pay attention to it.

The Chinese people's dispatch of an investigation team to Malaya is a just and reasonable action that fully demonstrates the Chinese people's keen concern for overseas Chinese. The British authorities have absolutely no reason to reject it.

　　关于派遣马来亚难侨调查团问题
    熊瑾玎斥葛里菲斯荒谬谈话
    指出：中国人民关怀海外华侨的合理行动，英国当局绝无理由加以拒绝。
    【新华社二十四日讯】中国人民救济马来亚难侨委员会主任熊瑾玎，本月二十四日，就本社记者所提出的关于派遣马来亚难侨调查团的几项问题，答复如下：
    问：中国人民救济马来亚难侨委员会遣派调查团往马来亚调查难侨的事情，进行情况如何？
    答：中国人民救济马来亚难侨委员会已于三月八日致电英国首相艾德礼，向他提出：我们要到马来亚进行调查难侨工作。至今月余，艾德礼尚无正式答复。
    问：英国殖民部大臣葛里菲斯最近曾在英国下议院发表谈话，说马来亚华侨有“自由”与“和平”；并说拒绝允许难侨调查团进入马来亚，你对他这一谈话的看法如何？
    答：葛里菲斯的这一谈话是荒谬绝伦的。全世界都知道，英国政府和马来亚殖民地政府当局不顾我二百八十余万华侨在马来亚与当地人民一起的伟大贡献，不顾国际道义，以凶残狂暴的血腥屠杀、强迫迁移、逮捕、驱逐、甚至集体囚禁和集体惩罚等野蛮手段，来对待我侨胞。华侨的财产被掠夺，房屋被烧毁，村落被扫荡，诸如此类的暴行，连马来亚英国殖民地政府御用报纸也连篇累牍地公开登载过。自一九四八年六月到目前为止，仅被驱逐出境的华侨即达四万人左右，去年一年内被送进监狱者共计一万五千余人。葛里菲斯早在去年三月亦自己供认“马来亚流离失所的华侨达四十万人”。反动的星洲日报最近还透露说：“居民现已面对着无家可归的威胁”。被驱逐归国的侨胞纷纷控诉马来亚已变成一座死亡恐怖的监狱，巨大数目的华侨已陷于饥寒交迫、妻离子散和家破人亡的境地。
    中国人民为了实地调查清楚马来亚华侨受难情况，才派遣调查团到马来亚去。如果葛里菲斯说，马来亚华侨有“自由”与“和平”，那末英国政府又何必害怕中国人民的调查团到马来亚去看一看呢？
    问：请你谈谈目前英国马来亚殖民地政府驱逐华侨出境的情况和我们接待归国难侨的情形。
    答：英国马来亚殖民地政府成批的大规模驱逐华侨回国，自去年十一月间开始，四个多月以来，被驱逐回国的华侨共计三五一三人，其中儿童妇女和老年人有二○二二人，占百分之五十七以上，这是四批归侨的人数，还有一批未列入。我们的人民政府及人民团体为了使这几批受难侨胞在归国后重新安家立业，平安生活，都根据各个人的具体情况，分别安置，有的人回乡生产，有的人参加工作或学习。难侨们都感到人民的祖国对他们是热心关怀与爱护的。
    问：国外华侨对于派遣马来亚难侨调查团的反应如何？
    答：它已获得了广大华侨的拥护。国外各地华侨和国内的归侨，纷纷来信，表示热烈的支持，并希望调查团早日出发。许多国外的华侨报纸用显著地位刊载此项消息及中国人民救济马来亚难侨委员会的声明，并发表评论指出中国人民这个决定和行动是完全合乎正义和人道的；英国政府和马来亚殖民地政府必须予以重视。
    中国人民派遣调查团前往马来亚调查完全是中国人民热切关怀海外华侨的既正义又合理的行动，英国当局绝对没有丝毫理由加以拒绝。
