In support of concluding a peace pact and opposing the United States arming Japan, a signature and voting campaign is being enthusiastically launched by the masses in Shanxi province. This movement is being carried out on the basis of popularizing patriotic education to resist America and aid Korea. According to a recent survey, out of 1.8 million people in the Yuncheng area, 1.4 million have received preliminary patriotic education to resist America and aid Korea, except for a small number of mountain areas and villages near the mountains. Among them, 400,000 people have received more systematic ideological education through schools, winter schools, and various trainings. In Pindding County, basically everyone is aware of the situation. The masses' awareness has generally increased, and most can recognize the significance of resisting America and aiding Korea: "Consolidating national defense is like inserting thorns on the wall to prevent wolves from entering the house!" "The front and the rear are of one mind; fighting wolves and production cannot be separated." "The field is like the battlefield, and the hoe is like a rifle!" However, the development of the entire movement is still very uneven. After the province universally established a plan to popularize patriotic education to resist America and aid Korea, the movement advanced rapidly. For example, in Xigou Village in Pingshun, where labor model Li Shunda is located, half of the women and a quarter of the men originally had little or no understanding of resisting America and aiding Korea. After inspection, a popularization plan was established, determining that all 44 party members, Youth League members, and propagandists in the village would be assigned fixed propaganda targets according to region and mutual aid group, and propaganda would be carried out separately. A conference was also held to denounce the aggressive atrocities of the U.S. and Japan. The movement was quickly popularized. Xingli, a 68-year-old man, also spoke about his suffering. Li Shunda's mutual aid group has all participated in the signing and voting.

Signature and voting activities are being held successively in factories and mines in Taiyuan. The Iron and Steel Plant held a representative conference to resist America and aid Korea on April 18. All the representatives participated in the signing and voting and resolved to strive for 100% participation of all employees in the signing and voting. Ninety-five percent of the employees of the No. 1 Flour Mill have already signed. In terms of schools, Shanxi University College of Science, Mingxian College and its affiliated middle and primary schools, Taigu Normal School, Yuncheng Normal School, Xinjiang Middle School, Yushe, and Xiangling High Primary School have begun signing and voting. On the 23rd, more than 5,000 Young Pioneer team members in Taiyuan City raised their hands to sign and vote 100% at the demonstration conference to resist America and aid Korea. They also went deep into the streets in groups to carry out propaganda and mobilize citizens to sign and vote.

This movement has also been enthusiastically launched in rural areas. Forty-five thousand out of 90,000 people in Licheng County have already signed, and 35,000 people have voted. Representatives of all circles in Linfen want to strive for 150,000 people to sign and vote out of 200,000 people in the county. Many rural areas in Fenxi, Huguan, Lishi, Heshun, Fencheng, Kelan, Tunliu, Yangcheng, Xiyang, and Wanquan counties have also started signing and voting. After in-depth mobilization in Nan Jixian Village in Xiyang, combined with denouncing the aggressive atrocities of the U.S. and Japan, the number of signatories reached 87%. The Shanxi Branch of the Resist America and Aid Korea Association recently issued a call, requesting the entire province to strive for 7 million people to participate in the signing and voting.

　　拥护缔结和平公约，反对美国武装日本
　  山西各地群众热烈举行签名投票
    山西全省热烈展开拥护缔结和平公约、反对美国武装日本的签名、投票运动。这一运动是在普及抗美援朝爱国教育的基础上展开的。据不久以前的调查，运城专区一百八十万人中，除了一小部分山区和接近山地的村庄外，已有一百四十万人初步受到抗美援朝爱国教育，其中有四十万人经过学校、冬学和各种训练，受到了比较系统的思想教育。平定县基本上已经做到家喻户晓。群众觉悟普遍提高，大多能认清抗美援朝的意义，“巩固国防是在墙头上插圪针，不让野狼进家！”“前方后方一条心，打狼生产不能分”、“田地好比战场，锄头好比步枪！”但整个运动发展还很不平衡。全省普遍订出普及抗美援朝爱国教育计划后，运动迅速大步前进。如劳动模范李顺达所在的平顺西沟村，原来也有半数妇女和四分之一的男人对抗美援朝不了解或很少了解。经过检查订出普及计划，确定全村四十四个党员、团员、宣传员按地区和互助组分工固定宣传对象，分别进行宣传，又举行了控诉美日侵略暴行的大会。运动迅速普及了。六十八岁的兴理老汉也诉了苦。李顺达互助组已全部参加了签名和投票。
    太原各厂矿正在陆续举行签名投票。钢铁厂于四月十八日举行抗美援朝代表大会，代表们全数参加了签名投票，并决议争取全厂百分之百的职工参加签名投票，面粉一厂已签名的职工达总人数百分之九十五。学校方面已开始签名投票的有山西大学理学院、铭贤学院及附中附小、太谷师范、运城师范、新绛中学、榆社、襄陵高小等。太原市五千余少年儿童队员于二十三日在抗美援朝示威大会上百分之百的举手签名投票。并分组深入街道，进行宣传，发动市民签名投票。
    这一运动在农村中也已热烈展开。黎城全县九万人中已有四万五千人签名，三万五千人投票。临汾各界代表会代表要在全县二十万人中争取十五万人签名投票。汾西、壶关、离石、和顺、汾城、岢岚、屯留、阳城，昔阳、万泉等县的不少农村，亦已开始了签名投票。昔阳南集贤村经过深入动员，结合控诉美日侵略暴行，签名人数达百分之八十七。山西抗美援朝分会顷发出号召，要求全省争取七百万人参加签名投票。
