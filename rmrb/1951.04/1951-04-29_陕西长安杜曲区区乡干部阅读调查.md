Reading Survey of District and Township Cadres in Duqu District, Chang'an, Shaanxi

　　On April 19th, the Xi'an Masses Daily published a survey report titled "District and Township Cadres Urgently Need Cultural Food" on the opinions of district and township cadres in Duqu District, Chang'an County, regarding books and periodicals. The report stated that a座谈会 was recently held in the district, attended by 22 district and township cadres, who expressed the following opinions on books and periodicals they wanted to read and those they had read:
  A. Books and periodicals they want to read but haven't yet:
    (1) Experiences and methods of rural work;
    (2) Popular pamphlets explaining policies;
    (3) Answers to current affairs questions;
    (4) Books and periodicals to help transform thinking;
    (5) Books and periodicals about establishing a revolutionary worldview;
    (6) Popular pamphlets explaining revolutionary theory (such as "On Practice");
    (7) Stories of the heroic battles of the People's Volunteer Army;
    (8) Stories of production models and labor heroes;
    (9) Popular science knowledge and stories to break superstitions;
    (10) Popular pamphlets explaining the benefits of the New Marriage Law;
    (11) Reading materials to encourage women to participate in social activities and production (such as co-production by men and women, learning, work, and production models among women);
    (12) Teaching materials and methods for educating village cadres;
    (13) Picture-story books and health posters with pictures and words;
    (14) Qinqiang and Meihu opera scripts, and song collections;
    (15) Popular publications to help with learning (like the elementary version of "Study").
  B. Opinions on books and magazines already read:
    One, liked: (1) Shaanxi Daily; (2) Propagandist Handbook; (3) Policy study materials (only saw the first collection).
    Two, opinions: (1) The Masses Daily is still too difficult. (2) "Northwest Literature and Art" and "Study" have long and difficult articles that are hard to understand. (3) On "Health Newsletter": It is considered very necessary, but the shortcoming is that too many summaries, announcements, and instructions are published, and too little introduction to health knowledge.
    What is the educational level of the district and township cadres in this district? Out of a total of 54 people, 37 have junior high school education (with basic reading ability), 12 have higher primary school education, 1 has elementary primary school education, and 2 each have high school education and rudimentary literacy. That is to say, cadres with junior high school education account for about 70% of all district and township cadres. They are all very enthusiastic about learning and have an extremely urgent need for books and periodicals, but they find it difficult to find suitable books, and "it is also impossible to buy books in the countryside, it is not easy to go to the city, and when you get to the city, you don't know what books to buy."
    This report points out: "Among all readers of books and periodicals, district and township cadres are a very large target audience. According to statistics, there are more than 60,000 district and township cadres in Shaanxi Province alone. If calculated based on the five northwestern provinces, the number should not be less than 150,000. However, among such a large number of readers, the majority have very low reading ability. Although they urgently need spiritual food, there is nothing for them to read today. What we give them completely fails to meet their requirements and cannot satisfy them. This cannot be said to be a serious problem."
    Based on the above situation, the report puts forward the following opinions: 1. Comrades who write articles should face this readership and write more things for them according to their needs. Sufficient importance should be attached to this readership. 2. Distribution workers should also pay attention to the countryside and allocate considerable resources to send various popular publications that rural cadres and the broad masses of peasants need and already exist to the countryside. 3. Strengthen book and periodical introductions and reviews in newspapers and periodicals. First, introduce some things that they urgently need, that are helpful to their learning, and that are easy to understand, so that district and township cadres can choose and purchase them. 4. County and district leaders should organize the vast number of district and township cadres to study in a planned and step-by-step manner according to the characteristics of the countryside.
    This report points out the opinions of district and township cadres in some areas on reading materials. These opinions are worth paying attention to. We believe that the people's publishing houses and other publishing houses in various places should, in accordance with the needs of local cadres and the broad masses, plan and earnestly strive for the publication of various local popular reading materials, and should also earnestly investigate whether the various popular reading materials that have been published can be distributed to the districts and townships and whether they are suitable for the needs of the readers.

### 陕西长安杜曲区区乡干部阅读调查

　　陕西长安杜曲区区乡干部阅读调查
    四月十九日西安群众日报以《区乡干部迫切需要文化食粮》为题，发表了一篇长安县杜曲区区乡干部对书刊意见的调查报道。报道说明最近在该区曾举行一次座谈会，参加的有区乡干部二十二人，他们对阅读以及没有阅读的书刊有如下的意见：
  甲、想看，但还没有看到的书刊
    （一）作农村工作的经验和办法；
    （二）解释政策的通俗小册子；
    （三）时事问题解答的；
    （四）帮助改造思想的；
    （五）有关建立革命人生观的；
    （六）通俗解释革命理论的小册子（如《实践论》）；
    （七）人民志愿军英勇打仗的故事；
    （八）生产模范、劳动英雄的故事；
    （九）破除迷信的科学常识和故事；
    （十）通俗解释新婚姻法有啥好处的小册子；
    （十一）鼓励妇女参加社会活动和参加生产的读物（如男女共同生产的，妇女中的学习、工作、生产模范等）；
    （十二）教育村干部的教材和方法；
    （十三）有图有字的连环故事画、卫生画；
    （十四）秦腔、郿鄠剧本、歌曲集子；
    （十五）通俗的帮助学习的刊物（如像学习初级版那样的东西。）
  乙、对已看到的书报杂志的意见
    一、喜欢看的：（一）陕西日报；（二）宣传员手册；（三）政策学习资料（只见了第一辑）。
    二、有意见的：（一）群众日报还太深。（二）《西北文艺》和《学习》文章长且深，看不懂。（三）对《卫生通讯》的意见：认为很需要，但缺点是总结、布告、指示登的太多，卫生常识介绍的太少。
    这一区的区乡干部文化水平有多高呢？全数五十四人，其中初中程度的（有初步阅读能力的）三十七人，高小十二人，初小一人，高中和粗识字的各二人。这就是说，初中程度的干部约占全体区乡干部的百分之七十。他们的学习情绪都很高，对书刊的要求异常迫切，但他们很难找到合适的书，而且“在乡下也买不到书，进城不容易，到了城里又不知买什么书好。”
    这一篇报道指出：“在书刊的所有读者对象中，区乡干部是个十分广大的对象，据统计：陕西一省区乡干部即达六万余人，可是如以西北五省计算，数目当不会在十五万以下可。是如此广大的读者中，大多数阅读能力很低，虽然他们迫切的需要精神食粮，今天却没有什么东西可读。我们给他们的完全不能满足他们的要求，不能使他们满意，这不能不说是一个严重的问题。”
    报道根据以上情况，提出如下的意见：一、写文章的同志应该面向这个读者层，根据他们的需要给他们多写一点东西，对这个读者对象应有足够的重视。二、发行工作者也应该重视农村，分出相当的力量把农村干部和广大农民群众需要而现在已经有了的各种通俗读物送到农村去。三、在报纸刊物上加强书刊介绍和评论工作，首先应介绍一些他们急切需要的，对他们学习有帮助而又通俗易懂的东西，以便于区乡干部选择购买。四、县区领导干部，应根据农村特点，有计划有步骤地组织广大区乡干部学习。
    这一篇报道指出了一部分地区区乡干部对读物的意见，这些意见是很值得重视的。我们以为各地方的人民出版社和其他出版社都应该依照地方干部及广大群众的需要，有计划地切实努力于地方性的各种通俗读物的出版，并应切实调查已出版的各种通俗读物是否能发行到区乡中去，是否适合于读者的需要。
