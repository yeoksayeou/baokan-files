  (I) In propaganda against American rearmament of Japan, we should guide the people to hate American imperialism.
    Our purpose in propagandizing against American rearmament of Japan is to make the masses of the people recognize that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. It wants to rearm Japan and use it as an accomplice to invade China and turn China into an American colony, so that the Chinese people, who have already stood up, will once again live the life of slaves. This will arouse the hatred of the people across the country for the American robbers and everyone will participate in the struggle to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country. The matter is very clear. The Japanese robbers have been defeated by the Chinese people. Without the support of American imperialism, they cannot make a comeback. Even if the United States rearmes it (it has not yet been fully armed), it can only act as a pawn of the United States. Today, the main enemy of the Chinese people is American imperialism. Therefore, in the propaganda on this issue, we should concentrate our firepower on the American robbers. The correct way to put the slogan should be: Oppose American imperialism rearming Japan! Do not shift the target, only publicizing that the Japanese invaders who invaded China at that time were hateful, without publicizing that the United States, which is currently rearming Japan, is the most hateful, so that the masses of the people simply hate the Japanese invaders of the past and relax their struggle against the current main enemy—American imperialism.
    Some propaganda teams organized by teachers, students, and staff of universities and middle schools in Beijing have grasped this point well when propagandizing to farmers in the suburbs, thus achieving great results. They talked about the Japanese invaders' "Three Alls Policy" in China and the American robbers' new "Three Alls Policy" in Korea, making the farmers realize that "all imperialists in the world are cannibals." In their plays, they performed how American imperialists handed guns to Japanese reactionaries, making the farmers realize: "It turns out that the backstage boss of Japan is the United States, and the American robbers are even more evil than the Japanese robbers." Therefore, when voting on the Japan issue, men and women all raised their hands to oppose American rearmament of Japan. This kind of propaganda method is correct and worth learning from in various places.
    But not all places are carrying out propaganda so correctly. For example, in the Second District of Wuhan, it was found that some propaganda work was done poorly. Residents only knew that the purpose of holding accusation meetings was to talk about the evils of the Japanese invaders, but they did not know that the United States was rearming Japan, and they did not connect the accusations of the atrocities of the Japanese invaders with the opposition to American rearmament of Japan. This shows that some propagandists have lost the purpose and direction of propaganda on this issue, so that they cannot achieve the expected results and may even produce bad side effects. I hope that other places will learn from this lesson and check themselves in the same way to correct similar deviations.
    We must recognize that, due to the Japanese invaders' armed invasion of China for as long as eight years, all of China was ravaged, and there is a widespread psychology of hatred for the Japanese invaders among the people. Therefore, when it comes to opposing the rearmament of Japan, the masses of the people easily concentrate their hatred on the Japanese invaders of the past, while ignoring that defeated Japan cannot rearm itself, and that the current enemy is American imperialism. This requires leaders to have a good grasp of propaganda and education work, to be good at guiding the emotions of the masses, and to raise the awareness of the masses, so that they can shift from hating the Japanese invaders of the past to hating American imperialism today, and then from hating American imperialism to embarking on the actual struggles of resisting America, aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and developing production.
  (II) Combine Resisting America and Aiding Korea with Suppressing Counter-revolutionaries
    The experience of the No. 610 Yarn Factory in combining the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, published in today's issue, is worthy of attention in various places.
    The movement to Resist America and Aid Korea must be combined with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. In places where counter-revolutionary activities are rampant, the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea often cannot be carried out well if counter-revolutionaries are not suppressed, because counter-revolutionaries are undermining this movement every day and every hour. Patriotic production competitions in many factories have been repeatedly sabotaged by counter-revolutionaries. After the elimination of counter-revolutionaries, the face of production has been completely renewed. The experience of the Chongqing No. 610 Yarn Factory is a clear example. In some places, counter-revolutionaries are still riding on the heads of the people. If they are not severely suppressed, the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea will not be easily carried out smoothly. For example, the masses of Beiguan Village in the First District of Qinyang County, Pingyuan Province, once said: Resisting America and Aiding Korea is good, but if lives are not guaranteed, what is the point of production?! After mobilizing the masses to accuse and expose counter-revolutionaries and severely suppressing them, the village enthusiastically launched a patriotic production competition and formulated a year-round production plan. This shows that Resisting America and Aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries should and can be closely combined.
    When conducting education on Resisting America and Aiding Korea and mobilizing the masses to accuse, the crimes of American imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and counter-revolutionaries can be linked together, while pointing out the relationship between them, so that the masses can realize that all counter-revolutionaries are ultimately manipulated and directed by American imperialism and serve American imperialism. In this way, it is possible to raise the masses' hatred for counter-revolutionaries to the height of opposing American imperialism and recognize the necessity of resisting America and aiding Korea. Similarly, in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, it is also possible to educate the masses through propaganda and accusations to recognize how counter-revolutionaries, under the command of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, carry out sabotage activities and endanger the people and the motherland; and then mobilize the masses to expose counter-revolutionaries and cut off the claws of American imperialism.
  (III) Eliminate the Blank Spots in the Movement to Resist America and Aid Korea
    Today's issue publishes investigation materials on the propaganda work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea in cities such as Shanghai, Wuhan, Xi'an, Shenyang, and Liaoyang. These materials show that even in some large and medium-sized cities where the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea has been widely launched, the propaganda and education work on Resisting America and Aiding Korea is still not universal and in-depth enough, and there are still many blank spots. From these materials, it can be seen that not only are there many people among the unorganized and scattered residents who have not received education on Resisting America and Aiding Korea, but even among the organized and concentrated factory workers, there are some who have not received education on Resisting America and Aiding Korea. This situation should arouse our serious attention.
    According to the provisions of the March 14th circular of this council, the latter half of April is the period for continuing to popularize the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea throughout the country. During this period, all localities should widely launch propaganda work on Resisting America and Aiding Korea, so that every place and every person can be educated on Resisting America and Aiding Korea. Large and medium-sized cities must also completely eliminate the blank spots in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea during this period. To achieve this goal, strenuous efforts must be made.
    The experience of various places proves that conducting spot checks is an effective way to understand the actual situation of propaganda work on Resisting America and Aiding Korea, and it is an important driving force for the work itself. This spot-checking method can not only be adopted now, but can also continue to be adopted in the future. After the period of universalizing the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea in the latter half of April and the May Day parade, all localities can conduct another spot check to see to what extent the movement has been popularized, so as to formulate methods for further deepening the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea in the future in accordance with the actual situation.

　　时评
  （一）在宣传反对美国武装日本时，应引导人民仇视美帝国主义
    我们宣传反对美国武装日本的目的，是在使人民群众认识美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，它要把日本重新武装起来，作为美国的帮凶，一同来侵略中国，把中国变成美国的殖民地，使已经站起来的中国人民再去过那种奴隶牛马的生活，从而激起全国人民对美国强盗的仇恨，人人参加到抗美援朝保家卫国的斗争中来。事情是很明白的，日本强盗已被中国人民所打败，如果没有美帝国主义的扶植，是不能卷土重来的。即使美国把它重新武装起来（现在还没有武装好），它也只能充当美国的走卒。今天中国人民的主要敌人是美国帝国主义。所以，在这个问题的宣传上，我们应该把斗争的火力集中到美国强盗身上。口号的正确提法，应该是：反对重新武装日本的美帝国主义！不要转移目标，只宣传当时侵略中国的日寇可恨，而不宣传今天正在武装日本的美国才最可恨，以致人民群众单纯地仇恨当年的日寇，而放松了对于当前主要敌人——美帝国主义的斗争。
    北京市大中学校师生员工所组织的某些宣传队，在向郊区农民宣传时对这一点掌握得很好，因而收到了很大的效果。它们从日寇在中国的“三光政策”，讲到美国强盗在朝鲜的新的“三光政策”，使农民认识到“天下帝国主义都吃人”。它们在演剧中，表演了美国帝国主义者把枪交给日本反动派，使农民认识到：“原来日本的后台老板是美国，美国强盗比日本强盗还恶。”因此，在举行日本问题投票时，男男女女都举手反对美国武装日本。这样的宣传方法是正确的，值得各地学习。
    但不是所有地方都是这样正确地进行宣传的。例如，武汉市第二区就发现某些宣传工作做得差的地方，居民只知道开控诉会是为了说日寇的坏，而不知道美国正在重新武装日本的事，没有把控诉日寇暴行和反对美国重新武装日本联系起来。这说明有些宣传工作者在这个问题上，迷失了宣传的目的和方向，以致不能收到预期的效果，甚至可能产生不好的副作用。希望其他地方接受这个教训，同样抽查一下，纠正类似的偏向。
    必须认识：由于日寇武装侵华达八年之久，全中国到处遭到蹂躏，人民中间普遍地存在着仇恨日寇的心理，所以，一提到反对重新武装日本，人民群众很容易把仇恨集中到当年的日寇身上，而忽略了战败国日本是不能自己重新武装自己的，当前的敌人是美帝国主义。这就要求领导者很好地掌握宣传教育工作，善于引导群众的情绪，提高群众的认识，使他们由仇恨过去的日寇，而转到仇恨今天的美帝国主义，再由仇恨美帝国主义，而走上抗美援朝、镇压反革命、发展生产等等的实际斗争。
  （二）把抗美援朝与镇压反革命结合起来
    本刊今日发表的六一○纱厂抗美援朝运动与镇压反革命结合进行的经验，值得各地注意。
    抗美援朝运动必须与镇压反革命相结合。在反革命分子活动猖獗的地方，如果不镇压反革命，抗美援朝运动往往不能很好开展。因为反革命分子每日每时都在破坏这一运动。不少工厂的爱国生产竞赛，曾屡遭反革命分子破坏。在清除反革命分子之后，生产面貌就为之一新。重庆六一○纱厂的经验是一个明显的例证。有些地方，反革命分子还骑在人民头上，如不予以严厉镇压，抗美援朝运动就不易顺利开展。如平原省沁阳县一区北关村群众曾这样说：抗美援朝是好，但性命不保，生产干啥？！而在发动群众控诉、检举了反革命分子，并予以严厉镇压之后，该村热烈展开了爱国生产竞赛，并订出了全年生产计划。这就说明，抗美援朝与镇压反革命，应该而且可能密切地结合进行。
    在对群众进行抗美援朝教育以及发动群众控诉时，可以把美帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮及反革命分子的罪行联系在一起，同时指明它们之间的关系，使群众认识到，一切反革命分子，归根到底是受美帝国主义的操纵与指挥，是为美帝国主义服务的。这样就能够把群众对反革命分子的仇恨，提高到反对美帝国主义的高度，认识到抗美援朝的必要性。同样，在镇压反革命运动中，也可以通过宣传、控诉，教育群众认识反革命分子如何在美帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮指挥下，进行破坏活动，危害人民祖国；进而发动群众检举反革命分子，斩断美帝国主义的爪牙。
  （三）消灭抗美援朝运动的空白点
    今天本刊发表了上海、武汉、西安、沈阳、辽阳等城市关于抗美援朝宣传工作的调查材料。这几个材料说明，即使在抗美援朝运动已经广泛展开的一些大中城市，抗美援朝的宣传教育工作仍是进行得不够普遍和深入的，仍然存在着许多空白点。从这几个材料中可以看出，不但在无组织的分散的居民中有很多人未受到抗美援朝的教育，而且甚至有组织的集中的工厂工人中，也有人未受到抗美援朝的教育。这种情况应该引起我们的严重注意。
    按照本会三月十四日通告的规定，四月下旬是在全国范围内继续普及抗美援朝运动的时期。在这段时间内，各地都应广泛展开抗美援朝的宣传工作，以便使每处每人都受到抗美援朝的教育。各大中城市也要在此时期中完全消灭抗美援朝运动的空白点。要达到这一目标，必须进行艰苦的努力。
    各地的经验证明：进行抽查，是了解抗美援朝宣传工作实际状况的有效办法，并且是对于工作本身的一个重要推动力。这种抽查办法，不仅现在可以采用，而且将来还可以继续采用。在经过四月下旬的抗美援朝运动的普及时期和五一大示威以后，各地可以再举行一次抽查，看这一运动已普及到什么程度，以便按照实际情形规定出今后进一步深入抗美援朝运动的办法。
