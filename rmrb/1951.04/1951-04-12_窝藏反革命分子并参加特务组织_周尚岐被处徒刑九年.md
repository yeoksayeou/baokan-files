【News Dispatch from Beijing】 The counter-revolutionary Zhou Shangqi, who harbored and shielded counter-revolutionary criminals and participated in a special agent organization, has been sentenced to nine years in prison by the Military Tribunal of the Beijing Military Control Commission.

The perpetrator Zhou is the owner of Zhouji Barber Shop in the People's Market of this city. He originally knew the special agent Zhang Yuzhong. Later, through Zhang, he met the special agent Wu Shaoxian. In March 1950, the two bandits, Wu and Zhang, told him about their special agent identification and work plans. Not only did Zhou fail to report them, but he further colluded with the bandit Zhang, joined the special agent organization, and even planned to rob a bank in a certain county together, actively raising travel expenses for Zhang and others to travel between Beijing and Tianjin. In order to conceal their identities as special agents, Zhou also registered their household registration for them, and they worked in Zhou's barber shop, preparing to lie low for a long time and carry out counter-revolutionary activities. In addition to the bandits Zhang and Wu being sentenced separately, the Military Tribunal, in accordance with Article 7, Paragraph 2, and Article 13 of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, sentenced the perpetrator Zhou to nine years in prison.

　　窝藏反革命分子并参加特务组织
  　周尚岐被处徒刑九年
    【京市新闻处讯】窝藏包庇反革命罪犯，并参加特务组织的反革命犯周尚岐，已由北京市军事管制委员会军法处判处徒刑九年。
    周犯是本市人民市场周记理发铺的老板，原来就与特务张玉忠相识。后来又经张匪介绍与特务吴绍贤认识。一九五○年三月，吴张二匪，将特务匪徒的证件、工作计划告诉他。周犯不但隐匿不报，并进一步与张匪勾结，参加了特务组织，并且计划一同到某县去抢劫银行，积极筹措张匪等来往于北京天津等地的路费。张匪等为了掩护特务身份，又由周匪替他们报上了户口，并在周犯的理发铺工作，准备长期潜伏，进行反革命活动。除张吴二匪另外判处外，军法处依据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例第七条第二款及第十三条的规定，判处周犯九年徒刑。（泉）
