[Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch] Accepting the Reasonable Demands of the Broad Masses of Citizens: Beijing Orders the Abolition of Real Estate Brokerage Activities

[Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch] In order to implement the resolution of the First Session of the Third Municipal People's Representatives Conference and abolish real estate brokerage activities, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has issued the following proclamation:

It has been found that some hooligans and local bullies in this city have continued the bad habits of the period of Japanese puppet and Kuomintang reactionary rule, using real estate brokerage as a cover to extort money from landlords, tenants, or buyers and sellers of houses through illegal means such as deception and intimidation, demanding high "brokerage fees," and driving up housing prices, undermining the housing policy of the People's Government. Such illegal acts have aroused dissatisfaction among the people of this city, who have demanded that the government strictly ban them. At the First Session of the Third Municipal People's Representatives Conference, many representatives proposed motions to ban brokers, which were resolved by the conference and handed over to the government for handling. Now, in order to implement the resolution of the representatives' conference and realize the demands of the broad masses of citizens, it is decided to ban brokers, i.e., real estate brokers, from the date of this proclamation. From now on, no so-called "advertising agencies," "service agencies," or other shops or individuals may solicit brokerage fees or any other fees in the name of brokering houses. Violators will be severely punished. Citizens buying, selling, or renting houses may either negotiate directly between the parties concerned or register with the Municipal Real Estate Exchange and its branches for assistance. If any illegal elements intimidate or disrupt the process, the parties concerned should immediately report them, and the government will investigate and deal with them.

[Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch] In order to implement the resolution of the First Session of the Third Municipal People's Representatives Conference, the Beijing Municipal People's Government issued an order on the 13th to abolish "brokers" and strictly prohibit any individual or organization from using the name of "advertising agency" to "broker houses" and damage the interests of the people.

These "brokers" are mostly local bullies, hooligans, fugitive landlords, and officials and Baojia chiefs from the Kuomintang reactionary regime. They often use extortion, deception, and other illegal means to extort high brokerage fees from the people and organizations who buy, sell, or rent houses, driving up housing prices and rents, and even hindering the normal buying, selling, and renting of houses, undermining the housing policy of the People's Government. For example, the house of Qian Niumengqiu at No. 24 Beiheyan Street had already been sold to the Beijing Real Estate Company for 500 bolts of cloth through the introduction of the Real Estate Exchange. However, the broker Li Quanbin obstructed the transaction and incited the resident Guo Xiyuan to demand high moving expenses. The owner was forced to raise the price to 580 bolts of cloth. Through Li Quanbin's "brokerage," the house was sold to another government organization. Li Quanbin used deception to ensure that the owner still only received 500 bolts of cloth, while the other 80 bolts were taken by Li Quanbin and others. The Petroleum Company bought a house at an agreed price of 1,500 bolts of cloth, but due to the "broker's" inflation of the price, they had to pay 3,000 bolts of cloth to buy the house. These "brokers" also often conceal enemy property and evade housing taxes. For example, the "broker" Wang Jinting and others assisted the family of Wu Zanzhou, a traitor who had served as the governor of Hebei Province under the Japanese puppet regime, in concealing Wu's property at No. 26 Xingsheng Hutong and pawned it to the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry for 730 bolts of cloth. Wang Jinting obtained a brokerage fee of 1 million yuan from this transaction. Soon, the Municipal People's Court announced the confiscation of this traitorous property. Due to the concealment and deception of the broker Wang Jinting, the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau paid 584 bolts of cloth for nothing and still had no place to live after nine months. As for the "brokers" instigating owners to underreport housing prices and evade housing taxes, the People's Government investigated 52 such cases in 1950 alone. Before the liberation of Beijing, these "brokers" often colluded with secret agents and puppet soldiers and police, ganging up to beat landlords. After the liberation of Beijing, the broker Mi Jingsheng even dared to beat the landlord Chen Haiting and force him to write a receipt for a brokerage fee worth six bolts of cloth. They often spread rumors, undermining the housing policy of the People's Government and hindering citizens from conducting fair and reasonable transactions through the Real Estate Exchange. They spread rumors saying: "The Land Administration Bureau measures houses in preparation for confiscating them." "The prices of houses sold through the Exchange all require the purchase of public bonds." Some "brokers" even posed as government workers and prohibited citizens from freely buying and selling houses. Some "brokers" even used "real estate brokerage" as a cover for counter-revolutionary activities, and Song Fujin, Fu Yueting, and others have been arrested by the Public Security Bureau.

The broad masses of the people in Beijing have long hated these evil acts of "brokers" and have demanded that the People's Government strictly ban them. In addition to accepting this reasonable demand of the people of Beijing, the Beijing Municipal People's Government also established five additional real estate exchange branches in the urban area on March 30 to help citizens buy and sell and rent houses fairly and reasonably.

[Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee held its second meeting on the 12th, chaired by Mayor Peng Zhen. The main agenda items were discussions on plans for building houses, constructing roads and bridges, and installing streetlights in the city, as well as on the abolition of real estate brokers and the handling of housing title disputes.

Secretary-General Xue Zizheng of the Municipal People's Government first reported on the plan to build 15,000 to 20,000 new houses. To implement this plan, it is planned to organize public and private forces to establish public construction companies and joint public-private real estate companies, and to promote larger public mining enterprises to build more employee dormitories, with banks providing loans to districts to repair some private houses and encourage private construction.

Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu reported on the abolition of real estate brokers, pointing out that most real estate brokers are hooligans and local bullies who make a living by deceiving, threatening, and extorting housing "brokerage fees," monopolizing housing transactions, and acting like local tyrants. Therefore, it was decided to accept the opinions of people from all walks of life and abolish all real estate brokerage activities. Committee members Xu Chubo, Zheng Yun, Shu Sheyu, Le Songsheng, Wang Wenbin, Cheng Hongyi, and others spoke successively, unanimously believing that the plan to build more houses was feasible and would not fail. The committee members unanimously agreed to abolish real estate brokers, citing actual examples of the various illegal activities of real estate brokers and the domineering behavior of some large brokers.

The meeting approved the plan for building houses and the proclamation on the abolition of real estate brokers.

The meeting also discussed and approved the "Provisional Measures of the Beijing Municipal People's Government for Handling Disputes over Housing Title Rights." "Housing Title Rights" is a long-standing social problem in this city, with numerous disputes. In order to rationally handle such disputes and implement the policy of protecting houses and developing industry and commerce, these provisional measures were formulated.

Director Wang Mingzhi of the Municipal Construction Bureau reported to the meeting on the plan for constructing and maintaining roads, bridges, and culverts, and installing streetlights in 1951. This plan was formulated based on proposals from the People's Representatives Conference of the city and various districts. Due to the limited municipal construction funds this year, the principle of spending less and doing more was adopted. It is planned to build and renovate some macadam roads and repair some hutong dirt roads in the city, saving a batch of funds to repair bridges and culverts in the suburbs, and to install more streetlights in remote hutongs. Committee member Shu Sheyu said: He strongly agreed with this approach, which focuses on popularization and solves the problems of the majority. After discussion, the meeting approved this plan of the Construction Bureau.

The meeting approved the revised proclamation on "Regulations on the Location of Electric Power Plants Above Three Horsepower in This City," the "Provisional Measures for Medical Management of Factories and Mines," the list of members of the Cultural and Educational Committee, and other personnel appointments and removals. Finally, the meeting approved the list of district heads, deputy district heads, and members of the District People's Government Committee elected by the People's Representatives Conference of the Twelfth District.

　　接受广大市民的合理要求
    北京明令取缔房纤活动
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府为执行第三届第一次各界人民代表会议的决议，取缔房屋纤手活动，顷发出布告如下：
    查本市现有一部分流氓、地痞沿袭日伪和国民党反动派统治时期的恶习，借拉房纤为掩护，用欺骗、威吓等不法手段，对房东、房客或房屋的买主、卖主实行敲诈，索取高额“纤费”，并且哄抬房价，破坏人民政府的房屋政策，这种不法行为，已引起本市人民的不满，纷纷要求本府严予取缔。在本市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议中，曾有许多代表提出取缔纤手的提案，并经大会决议，交由本府处理。兹为执行代表会议的决议，实现广大市民的要求，特决定自布告之日起，取缔纤手，即拉房纤的。今后，不论所谓“广告社”、“服务社”或其他店铺、个人均不得再有借说合房屋为名，索取纤费或其他任何费用，违者定予严惩。市民买卖或租赁房屋，或由当事人双方自行洽商，或到本市房地产交易所及其分所登记，由其代为介绍，均听当事人自便，倘有不法分子从中威吓破坏，当事人应立即告发，本府定予究办。
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府执行第三届第一次各界人民代表会议的决议，于十三日明令取缔“纤手”严厉禁止任何个人或借用所谓“广告社”等名义“拉房纤”，损害人民利益。
    这些“纤手”，大多数是地痞、流氓、逃亡地主和国民党反动政权中的官僚、保甲长等，他们经常用敲诈、欺骗等非法手段，向买卖或租赁房屋的人民和机关、团体勒索高额纤费，哄抬房价和租金，甚至阻挠房屋的正常买卖、租赁，破坏人民政府的房屋政策。例如北河沿二十四号钱钮梦秋的房屋，本来已经房地产交易所介绍，以五百匹布的价格卖给北京房产公司。纤手李全斌却从中阻挠，嗾使住户郭西园索取高额搬家费。房主被迫将房价抬高到五百八十匹布，经李全斌“拉纤”，将该房与另一机关成交，李全斌用欺骗手段使房主仍旧只得五百匹布，其他八十匹被李全斌等骗去。石油公司所买到的一所房屋，本来说妥按一千五百匹布的价格成交，由于“纤手”从中哄抬房价，结果付出三千匹布才将房子买到。这些“纤手”还经常隐匿敌产，偷漏房税。例如“纤手”王金亭等协助曾任日伪河北省省长的汉奸吴赞周的家属，隐匿吴逆在兴盛胡同二十六号的房产一所，并以七百三十匹布的价格，典给重工业部钢铁工业局，王金亭从中取得纤费一百万元。不久，市人民法院宣布没收这所逆产。由于纤手王金亭的隐瞒、欺骗，使钢铁工业局白白付出了五百八十四匹布，至今九个月还没有房子住。至于“纤手”主使业主少报房价，偷漏房税的事件，仅一九五○年经人民政府查出的就有五十二件。这些“纤手”在北京解放以前，常与特务、伪军警相勾结，成群结伙，殴打房主。北京解放后，纤手米景升还胆敢殴打房主陈海亭，强迫他写出价值六匹布的纤费。他们经常制造谣言，破坏人民政府的房屋政策，阻挠市民通过房地产交易所进行公平合理的交易。他们造谣说：“地政局测量房屋，是准备没收房屋。”“经过交易所成交立契的房价，都得买公债。”有的“纤手”还冒充政府工作人员，禁止市民自由买卖房屋。有的“纤手”甚至以“拉房纤”作掩护，进行反革命活动，已经公安局加以逮捕的有宋福金、傅月亭等。
    北京市广大人民对于“纤手”的这些罪恶行为，早已深恶痛绝，纷纷要求人民政府严加取缔。北京市人民政府除接受北京市人民的这项合理要求外，并于三月三十日在城区增设了五个房地产交易分所，帮助市民公平合理地买卖和租赁房屋。（曾普）
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府委员会于十二日举行第二次会议，由彭真市长主席，主要议程是讨论关于本市修建房屋、修筑道路桥梁和安装路灯的计划，以及关于取缔房屋纤手和关于处理房屋铺底权问题。
    市人民政府薛子正秘书长首先报告关于增建一万五千间至两万间房屋的计划。为了执行这一计划，准备组织公私力量，建立公营建筑公司和公私合营的房产公司，并推动较大的公营矿厂企业增建职工宿舍，由银行贷款给各区修缮一部分民房及鼓励私人盖房。
    张友渔副市长报告关于取缔房屋纤手的问题，他指出房纤多是出身于流氓、地痞，靠欺骗、威胁、诈取房屋“纤费”为业，垄断房屋交易，行同恶霸，故决定接受各界人民的意见，取缔一切房纤的活动。徐楚波、郑芸、舒舍予、乐松生、王文斌、程宏毅等委员相继发言，一致认为增建房屋的计划是可行的，是不会落空的。各委员并一致同意取缔房纤，并以实际例证列举房纤各种不法活动的情况以及一部大纤手的恶霸行为。
    会议通过了修建房屋的计划和关于取缔房屋纤手的布告。
    会议还讨论通过了“北京市人民政府关于铺底权纠纷处理试行办法”。“铺底权”是本市存在已久的一个社会问题，纠纷丛生。为了合理地处理这类纠纷，贯彻保护房屋和发展工商业的政策，故制定了这个试行办法。
    市建设局王明之局长向会议报告了一九五一年修建和保养道路、桥涵，以及安装路灯的计划，这个计划是根据市和各区各界人民代表会议的提案制订的。由于本年市政建设经费有限，故本着少花钱多作事的方针，拟在市内新修和翻修一部分石碴路、整修一部分胡同土路，省出一批经费，修补郊区的桥梁和涵洞；并在偏僻胡同内增设路灯。舒舍予委员发言说：他非常同意这种着重普及，解决多数人的问题的方针。经讨论后，会议批准了建设局的这个计划。
    会议通过了修正“关于本市设置三马力以上之电力工厂地点规定”的布告，“关于工厂矿场医务管理暂行办法”以及文教委员会委员名单和其他人事任免事项。最后，批准了第十二区各界人民代表会议选出的区长、副区长和区人民政府委员会的名单。
