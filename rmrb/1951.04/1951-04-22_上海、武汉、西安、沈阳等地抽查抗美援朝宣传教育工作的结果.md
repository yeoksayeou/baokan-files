Recently, many places have conducted spot checks on the propaganda and education work of resisting America and aiding Korea. The results of the spot checks prove that although the propaganda and education work of resisting America and aiding Korea in various places has achieved significant results, it is not yet widespread enough and not deep enough, and needs to be further strengthened. Now we publish the abstracts of the spot check materials from Shanghai, Wuhan, Xi'an, Shenyang, Liaoyang and other places here for reference.

(1) Investigation of Baishoufang in Penglai District, Shanghai: There are 131 households and 485 people in this alley. Among them, there are 38 winter defense service team members, 36 family women's federation members, 5 Communist Youth League members, 7 young students, 125 primary school students, and 9 activists, as well as a literacy class. The main propaganda work carried out in this alley was: 1. The service team held four mass meetings, with 18 to 40 people participating each time; 2. A propaganda performance, with more than 120 listeners; 3. Giving political lessons in the literacy class, which has 125 students; 4. Propaganda on current affairs on the blackboard newspaper, but because the content was not popular, the effect was minimal; 5. Activists passed on the reports they heard about resisting America and aiding Korea to the masses; 6. Primary school students conveyed simple sentences about resisting America and aiding Korea to their parents at home. According to the results of this inspection, after these propaganda and education work, all 38 winter defense team members have a relatively clear understanding of the issue of resisting America and aiding Korea; 95 of the 99 housewives know that American imperialism is China's enemy; 85 of the literacy class members know that the United States is China's enemy, and 110 know that the Soviet Union and North Korea are China's good friends. However, some elderly people and some women who did not attend the meetings still do not know about resisting America and aiding Korea, and some primary school students have learned the four characters "resist America and aid Korea," but do not understand the principles of resisting America and aiding Korea.

(2) Two investigation materials from Wuhan City

(A) In order to understand the situation of the propaganda work of resisting America and aiding Korea, the Propaganda Department of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted a test on some employees of Wuhan Match Factory, Jianghan Shipbuilding Factory No. 3, and Textile Factory No. 1 in late March, using oral and written tests. The results of the test show that although the understanding of cadres and general employees of these units on resisting America and aiding Korea has made significant progress compared with the past, there are still great weaknesses. For example, in the fifth row, twenty-ninth group of fine yarn in class A of the South Factory of the No. 1 Yarn Factory, seven-ninths of the people do not know why to conduct production competitions, and six-ninths of the people do not know that the United States is invading Korea and is arming Japan. Among the eleven people in the eighteenth group of the third row of fine yarn in class A of the North Factory of the factory, only four people know that the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are fighting with the United States, and the remaining seven people only know that Korea is fighting, but do not know who is fighting with whom; three people know that the United States is arming Japan, and the remaining eight do not know. Wuhan Match Factory is better, but less than half can explain the reason for the patriotic production competition.

(B) The Propaganda Department of the Second District Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China sent people to conduct spot checks on 16 winter defense groups in late March and early April. In the groups with better propaganda work, residents have a good understanding of resisting America and aiding Korea, and can all explain the significance of resisting America and aiding Korea. However, in the worse groups, residents only know about resisting America and aiding Korea and donating money to relieve Korean refugees, but do not know why to resist America and aid Korea; they only know that the purpose of holding accusation meetings is to talk about the evils of the Japanese invaders, but do not know about the United States rearming Japan, and have not linked the accusation of the Japanese invaders' atrocities with the opposition to the United States rearming Japan. Some people only know the four characters of resisting America and aiding Korea, and know nothing else, and some have not even heard of resisting America and aiding Korea. In the two households spot-checked in Qiaokou, both said that they had attended meetings, but did not know what was said at the meetings.

(3) Investigation materials from the Seventh District of Xi'an: In mid-April, the Seventh District Committee of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted a spot check on the propaganda work of resisting America and aiding Korea in the two residential areas of Doufu Lane and Jinglong Pond. There are 307 households and 1,377 people in the two places. This time, only 444 people in 206 households were investigated. The investigators conducted simple oral tests on the people interviewed. Among these 400-plus people, 290 people have a good and relatively good understanding of resisting America and aiding Korea, accounting for more than 65% of the number of people interviewed. They understand the general principles of resisting America and aiding Korea, and some can also relate it to their own lives and due responsibilities. The rest of the people have a very vague understanding of resisting America and aiding Korea. Some people only know the phrase "resist America and aid Korea," but do not know what it means. Some people know the meaning of these four characters, but do not know why. Some people only know about fighting, but do not know who is fighting with whom, and where; a small number of people do not know about this at all. Some women have participated in demonstrations by women from all walks of life against the United States arming Japan, but they did not know why before or after the event. Some women have raised donations of comfort items for Korean refugees, but they do not know why they are raising donations, or who they are raising donations for, they only know that they were given to the refugees.

(4) Investigation materials from a residential group in Shenyang: Zhao Tianlin, the Minister of Propaganda of the Heping District Committee of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and others conducted an investigation in the eighteenth residential group of the eighth household registration district in the district in the form of visiting homes. There are 33 households in this residential group, and 22 households were investigated. This is a relatively backward group in the district's propaganda work. The propagandists have just been established and have not yet penetrated into the residents to carry out propaganda. The residential group's meetings rarely talk about resisting America and aiding Korea. After individual conversations, it was learned that men all understand the issue of resisting America and aiding Korea, and many people understand it very well. The residential group leader and grassroots cadres have a clear understanding of various issues. Two housewives and eight elderly people do not know about resisting America and aiding Korea at all, and other women can only say the eight characters "resist America and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country," but do not understand what it means. Some women only learned about resisting America and aiding Korea after watching a movie. Children who are studying all understand the simple principles of resisting America and aiding Korea.

(5) Investigation materials from a residential group in Liaoyang: The Liaoyang Municipal Cultural Center conducted a spot check in the twenty-fourth group of the third household registration district of the Xiangping Police Station in the city in March, and a total of 29 people were investigated. Among them, two women only know about resisting America and aiding Korea, but do not know why to resist America and aid Korea. In addition, the general public's understanding of resisting America and aiding Korea is also very vague, and they have not established confidence in the victory of the Korean War. Women representatives who often go to various meetings and know some current affairs have a clearer understanding of resisting America and aiding Korea.

　　上海、武汉、西安、沈阳等地抽查抗美援朝宣传教育工作的结果
    最近很多地方都对抗美援朝的宣传教育工作进行了抽查。抽查的结果证明，各地所进行的抗美援朝的宣传教育工作虽然都已获得显著成绩，但还不够普遍，不够深入，须要进一步加强。现在我们把上海、武汉、西安、沈阳、辽阳等地的抽查材料摘要发表在这里，以供各地参考。
    （一）上海市蓬莱区百寿坊的调查：该弄共一百三十一户人家，四百八十五人。其中有冬防服务队员三十八人，家庭妇联会员三十六人，青年团员五人，青年学生七名，小学生一百二十五人，积极分子九人，另有义务识字班一所。在该弄所进行的抗美援朝宣传工作主要为：１、由服务队召开过四次群众会，每次有十八至四十人参加；２、化装宣传一次，听众一百二十多人；３、在义务识字班讲政治课，识字班有学员一百二十五人；４、在黑板报上宣传时事，但因内容不通俗，作用甚小；５、积极分子将自己所听到的关于抗美援朝的报告传达给群众；６、让小学生把关于抗美援朝的简单几句话传达给家里大人。据这次检查结果，经过这些宣传教育工作以后，三十八个冬防队员对抗美援朝问题都是认识得比较清楚的；九十九个家庭妇女中有九十五人知道美国帝国主义是中国的敌人；识字班中有八十五人知道美国是中国的敌人，一百一十名知道苏联、朝鲜是中国的好朋友。但有些年老的人和一部分不参加会议的妇女，还不知道抗美援朝这回事，有些小学生虽然学会了“抗美援朝”四个字，但不懂得抗美援朝的道理。
    （二）武汉市的两个调查材料
    （甲）中共武汉市委宣传部为了了解抗美援朝宣传工作的情形，于三月下旬对武汉火柴厂、江汉船舶三厂、第一纺织厂等单位的一部分职工举行了一次测验，方式是用口试和笔试。测验的结果表明这些单位的干部与一般职工对抗美援朝的认识虽已较前有了显著进步；但仍有很大弱点。例如：一纱厂南厂甲班细纱第五排第二十九组，九分之七的人都不知道为什么要进行生产竞赛，九分之六的人还不知道美国侵略朝鲜和正在武装日本的事。该厂北厂甲班细纱第三排第十八小组十一个人中间，只有四个人晓得中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在和美国打仗，其余七个人只晓得朝鲜在打仗，但不晓得谁同谁在打；三个人知道美国在武装日本，其余八个不知道。武汉火柴厂较好，但说得出爱国生产竞赛的道理的也不到一半。
    （乙）中共武汉市第二区区委宣传部派人于三月底和四月初抽查了十六个冬防小组。在宣传工作较好的组中，居民对抗美援朝都有了认识，都可讲出抗美援朝的意义。但在较差的组中，居民只知抗美援朝和捐款救济朝鲜难民，但不知道为什么要抗美援朝；只知道开控诉会是为了说日寇坏，不知道美国重新武装日本的事，没有把控诉日寇暴行和反对美国重新武装日本联系起来。部分的人只知道抗美援朝四个字，其他全不知道，有的连抗美援朝还没听说过。在硚口抽查的两户，都说去开过会，会上讲的什么却不知道。
    （三）西安第七区的调查材料：中共西安市第七区区委会在四月中旬抽查了窦付巷、景龙池两个居民区的抗美援朝宣传工作的情况。该两地共三百零七户，一千三百七十七人。这次只调查了二百零六户中的四百四十四个人。调查者对被访问的人都进行了简单的口试。在这四百多人当中，对抗美援朝认识很好的和比较好的共二百九十人，占访问人数的百分之六十五强，他们对抗美援朝的一般道理都懂得，有的还能联系到自己的生活和应尽的责任。此外的人对抗美援朝的认识非常模糊。有些人只知抗美援朝这一句话，但不知道是什么意思。有的人知道这四个字的意思，但不知道为什么。有的人只知道打仗，但不知谁和谁打，在什么地方打；少数人还根本不知道这件事。有的妇女曾参加过各界妇女反对美国武装日本的示威，但事前事后均不知道为什么。有的妇女曾给朝鲜难民募捐过慰劳品，但不知道为什么募捐，给谁募捐，只知道给了难民。
    （四）沈阳市一个居民组的调查材料：中共沈阳市和平区区委会宣传部长赵天林等在该区第八户口区第十八居民组，以串门形式作了一次调查。该居民组共三十三户，调查了二十二户。这是该区宣传工作较落后的一个组。宣传员刚建立起，还未深入到居民中去进行宣传，平时居民组的会议上很少讲抗美援朝的事。经个别谈话了解：男人对抗美援朝的事情都懂，有不少人理解得很好。居民组长和基层干部对各项问题的认识都较明确。有两名家庭妇女和八位老人根本不知道抗美援朝的事，其他妇女也只能说出“抗美援朝，保家卫国”八个字，但不了解这是什么意思。有些妇女是在看了电影以后才知道抗美援朝这回事的。念书的小孩都懂得抗美援朝的简单道理。
    （五）辽阳市一个居民组的调查材料：辽阳市文化馆于三月间在该市襄平派出所第三户籍区第二十四组进行了抽查，共调查了二十九个人。其中有两名妇女只知抗美援朝，但不知为什么要抗美援朝。此外一般人对抗美援朝的认识也非常模糊，对朝鲜战争的胜利信心也没树立起来。常到各处开会知道一些时事的妇女代表，对抗美援朝就了解得比较清楚些。
