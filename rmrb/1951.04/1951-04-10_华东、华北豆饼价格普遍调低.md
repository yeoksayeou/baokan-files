　　Huadong, Huabei Soybean Cake Prices Universally Lowered
    Soybean cake prices in the East China region and the five provinces and two cities of North China have been universally reduced. In order to cooperate with the completion of this year's agricultural production increase task, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government lowered the listed prices of soybean cake of state-owned native produce companies in the East China region and the five provinces—important agricultural production areas—of North China starting from March 12th. Among them, the soybean cake listed prices in the economic crop producing areas of cotton, tobacco, and other crops in Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces were reduced even more than in general areas. Calculated in terms of grain, the reduced soybean cake price is cheaper than in any previous year. For example, compared with the cheapest period for soybean cake in the past, in December 1950, Hebei Province generally needed 0.56 jin of Beihe millet to exchange for one jin of soybean cake, now Baoding only needs 0.53 jin of Fudi millet to exchange for one jin of soybean cake, and Tianjin only needs 0.49 jin. In Jinan, Shandong, 0.51 jin of wheat was needed to exchange for one jin of soybean cake in 1950, but now only 0.47 jin of wheat is needed to exchange for one jin of soybean cake.
    At the same time, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government also stipulated preferential measures for cooperatives to purchase soybean cake: all cooperative members who raise cash to purchase soybean cake from state-owned native produce companies in various places can enjoy a 2% discount on the company's listed price; all cooperative members who purchase soybean cake through the native produce company may receive a 1% discount. The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government also instructed state-owned native produce companies and cotton, yarn and cloth companies in various places to sign agreements to encourage farmers to exchange cotton for soybean cake. The price of cotton is based on the listed price, and the price of soybean cake can be sold to farmers at a 2% discount on the listed price.

　　华东、华北豆饼价格普遍调低
    华东区和华北五省二市豆饼价格已经普遍降低。中央人民政府贸易部为了配合完成今年农业增产任务，从三月十二日起调低了华东区和华北五省——重要农业生产地区——国营土产公司的豆饼牌价，其中河北、平原、山东各省的棉花、烟叶等经济作物产区的豆饼牌价又比一般地区调低得更多。折成粮食计算，调低后的豆饼价格比过去任何一年都便宜。例如：和过去豆饼最便宜的时期相比，河北省在一九五○年十二月一般要零点五六斤北河小米才能换到一斤豆饼，现在保定只要零点五三斤伏地小米就可换一斤豆饼，天津只要零点四九斤。山东济南在一九五○年要零点五一斤小麦才能换一斤豆饼，现在只要零点四七斤小麦就可换一斤豆饼。
    同时，中央人民政府贸易部又规定了合作社购买豆饼的优待办法：凡是合作社自筹现款向各地国营土产公司购买豆饼的，社员可以得到按公司牌价打九八折的优待；凡是合作社代理土产公司销售的，社员买豆饼也可得到打九九折的优待。中央人民政府贸易部并指示各地国营土产公司和花纱布公司订立协议，鼓励农民拿棉花来换豆饼，棉花按牌价作价，豆饼可按牌价打九八折作价卖给农民。
