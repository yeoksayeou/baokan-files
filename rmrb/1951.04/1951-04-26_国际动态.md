　　International Developments
  Failure of Base Methods of the French Government
    The French government shamelessly exploited the difficult living conditions of unemployed workers in Brest, demanding that they go to the Upper Alps to repair an airfield for the American air force, and threatening them with "suspension of unemployment benefits if they refuse." However, the unemployed workers in Brest were not subdued by this threat. They sent a delegation to protest this attempt to violate the people's will to the local government, expressing their absolute unwillingness to build an airfield for the American military. In the face of these staunch and unyielding peace fighters, the French reactionary rulers' attempt to please their American masters suffered a shameful defeat.
  Italian People Demand Improved Living Standards
    Nearly three thousand secondary schools throughout Italy, with sixty-two thousand faculty and staff, began a general strike on the morning of April 18, protesting the Minister of Education's rejection of their proposed salary increases and other demands. This general strike affected seven hundred and twenty-two thousand students across Italy. The Italian General Confederation of Labor has issued a call for all union members to provide various forms of assistance to the striking faculty and staff.
    Four thousand unemployed merchant seamen in Torre del Greco, near Naples, held a demonstration on the 16th with their families, demanding work and bread. Motorized police launched a brutal attack on this group of people demanding a way to live, resulting in nineteen injuries.
    The Italian people are suffering from the hardships brought about by the war economy and are fighting to win their vital interests.

  法政府卑劣手段的失败
    法国政府厚颜无耻地利用布勒斯特失业工人的生活困苦情况，要他们到上阿尔卑斯替美国空军修机场，并以“如果不去，便停付失业救济金”来威胁。但是布勒斯特的失业工人并没有被这种威胁所屈服，他们派出了代表团向当地政府抗议这种违反人民意志的企图，表示绝对不愿为美军修筑飞机场。在这些坚强不屈的和平斗士面前，法国的反动统治者讨好美国主子的图谋遭到了可耻的失败。
  意大利人民要求改善生活
    全意大利近三千个中学的六万二千个教职员，已在四月十八日上午开始总罢教，抗议教育部长拒绝他们所提增加薪水及其他各项要求。这次总罢教影响到全意七十二万二千个学生。意大利总工会已发出号召，要求一切的工会会员给罢教的教职员们各种援助。
    那不勒斯附近托勒·德尔·克莱科城的四千失业商运海员，在十六日携带家属举行了示威，要求工作和面包。摩托化警察向这支要求活命的人的队伍发动残酷的袭击，结果使十九个人负伤。
    意大利人民饱受备战经济带给他们的生活苦难，正在为争取他们的切身利益而斗争。
