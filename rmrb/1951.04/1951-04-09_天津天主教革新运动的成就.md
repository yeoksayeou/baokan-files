　　Achievements of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement

The Tianjin Catholic Self-Reliance Reform Movement Promotion Association was officially established on the 7th. This is a major achievement of the Tianjin Catholic self-reliance reform movement. The patriotic Catholics of the Tianjin Diocese have organized and raised the banner of patriotism. The Tianjin Catholic self-reliance reform movement developed in the struggle against imperialist elements Wen Guibin, Bu Xiangxian (American imperialist spy, already arrested), and others. Now, 15,000 Catholics have signed the reform declaration, and many Chinese priests have also joined in signing. Tianjin's example shows that the movement for self-government, self-propagation, and self-support is a patriotic movement supported by the vast number of Chinese Catholics. Any imperialist elements and reactionaries who try to obstruct this just patriotic movement will be met with a bloody nose!

The Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement began in December of last year with the accusations by students in Tianjin church schools against the crimes of American imperialism. This accusation awakened the students' and faculty's patriotic consciousness, promoted righteousness, and overwhelmed evil. After this accusation movement developed, the students also paid attention to the unity of Catholics and non-Catholics, thus creating conditions for the Tianjin Catholic Three-Self Reform Movement. This movement developed from schools to Catholics, and on January 11th of this year, the preparatory committee of the Tianjin Catholic Self-Reliance Reform Movement Promotion Association was established. Imperialist elements such as Wen Guibin and Bu Xiangxian threatened patriotic Catholics with "betrayal," "schism," "suspension of divine service," "removal of divine authority," and "going to hell," but the patriotic Catholics were not afraid of these threats, and argued with them with justification, exposing the facts of imperialism using religion to invade China. In this way, Chinese priests and more Catholics also joined the signing of the declaration. Patriotic Catholics in Tianjin's nine churches gave speeches on the Three-Self Movement and solicited signatures from Catholics. The cracking down on the counter-revolutionary "Catholic Patriotic Corps" and the arrest of American imperialist spy Bu Xiangxian exposed the lies of the imperialist elements in Catholicism, who claimed to be "supra-national, supra-political" and "never associated with imperialism." The self-reliance reform movement has developed even further.

Like other dioceses across the country, Tianjin's Catholicism was originally controlled by imperialist elements and their lackeys, who were the mortal enemies of the reform movement, and the consciousness of the Catholics was originally not high. Imperialist elements are adept at using intimidation, bribery, rumors, slander, provocation, and discord, and imperialist elements in Tianjin Catholicism also exhausted these means. But the facts in Tianjin prove that these methods of imperialist elements cannot stop the awakening of the Catholic masses. As long as it is a just cause, a single spark can start a prairie fire. Since patriotic Catholics have the sympathy of the people and the support of the people's government, they will surely be able to defeat the conspiracies of imperialist elements. Patriotic Catholics across the country should learn from Tianjin's example, resolutely fight against imperialist elements and their lackeys, and realize the self-reliance reform of Catholicism.

In order to consolidate and expand the victory of the Catholic Reform Movement, extensive mass publicity must be carried out. In this way, the movement can penetrate the broad masses of Catholics. That is to say, we must be good at using newspapers, periodicals, radio stations, and all propaganda tools to explain the significance of the Reform Movement in order to raise the political consciousness of Catholics. All propaganda organs and people's organizations should support the patriotic movement of Catholics and help them fight against imperialist elements. The patriotic Catholics of Tianjin go to the churches to give speeches on the significance of the Three-Self Movement, and set up signature stations in various churches to solicit Catholic signatures for the Reform Declaration. These propaganda methods should be followed by patriotic Catholics in various places. The publication "Guangyang" published by the preparatory committee of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association not only educated the Catholics in Tianjin, but also educated the vast number of Catholics in North China. Catholics in Tangshan, Suiyuan, Shanxi and other places have written letters requesting "Guangyang" to introduce more of the real situation of Catholicism in order to raise the political consciousness of Catholics. In the past, ordinary Catholics hated the imperialist elements who oppressed them on the one hand, and were deceived by them on the other. Now, the vast number of Catholics are asking to understand the real situation of Catholicism. This real situation is the real situation of imperialists using Catholicism to carry out aggressive activities; the real situation of imperialist elements and their lackeys carrying out special agent activities hidden in Catholicism; and the real situation of imperialist elements squandering money in the church and oppressing Chinese priests and Catholics. Once they understand these real situations, they will suddenly realize and join the patriotic reform movement to fight resolutely against imperialist elements.

The victory of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement is only a preliminary victory. Imperialist elements will never be reconciled to their failure, and they will inevitably make a desperate struggle to sabotage the Reform Movement. Therefore, the patriotic Catholics of Tianjin must raise their vigilance, continue to fight against imperialist elements, continue to educate Catholics and constantly raise their political consciousness, consolidate and strengthen unity, and push the movement forward until they completely overthrow the privileges of imperialist elements in the church, drive out the forces of imperialism in the church, so that imperialists have no possibility to use the church to carry out aggressive activities again.

### 天津天主教革新运动的成就

　　天津天主教革新运动的成就
    天津天主教自立革新运动促进会已于七日正式成立。这是天津天主教自立革新运动一个重大的成就。天津教区的爱国的天主教徒，已经组织起来，树立起爱国主义的旗帜。天津天主教自立革新运动，是在与帝国主义分子文贵宾、卜相贤（美帝国主义间谍分子，已逮捕）等的斗争中发展起来的。现在，在革新宣言上签名的天主教徒已达一万五千人，许多中国神甫亦已参加签名。天津的榜样，说明了自治自传自养的运动，是广大中国天主教徒所拥护的爱国运动，任何帝国主义分子和反动分子，如果要阻挡这个正义的爱国运动，就要碰得头破血流！
    天津天主教革新运动，开始于去年十二月天津教会学校中同学对美国帝国主义罪行的控诉，这种控诉唤起了学生和教职员的爱国觉悟，伸张了正气，压倒了邪气。在这个控诉运动发展起来之后，同学们又注意了教徒与非教徒的团结，因而为天津天主教的三自革新运动创造了条件。这个运动，由学校发展到教徒中，今年一月十一日成立了天津天主教自立革新运动促进会筹备委员会。帝国主义分子文贵宾、卜相贤等，以“背叛”“裂教”“停止神功”“摘神权”“下地狱”等威吓爱国的教徒，但是爱国的教徒不怕这些威吓，理直气壮地与他说理辩论，揭露帝国主义利用宗教侵略中国的事实，这样，中国神甫和更多的教徒也就参加宣言的签名。天津的九个教堂里都有爱国的教徒演讲三自运动和征求教徒签名。反革命的“公教报国团”的破获，和美帝国主义间谍卜相贤的逮捕，揭露了天主教中帝国主义分子所谓“超国际、超政治”，“从未与帝国主义有联系”的鬼话，自立革新运动更加发展起来。
    和全国的其他教区一样，天津的天主教原来是由帝国主义分子及其走狗所把持的，他们乃是革新运动的死敌，而教徒的觉悟是原来不高的。帝国主义分子，是惯会用威吓、利诱、造谣、污蔑、挑拨、离间等手段的，天津天主教中的帝国主义分子也是施尽了这些手段的。但是天津的事实，证明帝国主义分子的这些手段并不能阻挡天主教教徒群众的觉悟。只要是正义的事业，星星之火，可以燎原。爱国的教徒既然得到人民的同情，和人民政府的支持，是一定可以战胜帝国主义分子的阴谋的。全国各地爱国的天主教徒，应该学习天津的榜样，与帝国主义分子及其走狗坚决斗争，来实现天主教的自立革新。
    为了巩固与扩大天主教革新运动的胜利，必须进行广泛的群众性的宣传。这样，才能使运动深入到广大教徒群众中去。这就是说，要善于利用报纸、刊物、广播电台以及一切的宣传工具，来解释革新运动的意义，以提高教徒的政治觉悟。一切宣传机关、人民团体，应该支持天主教的爱国运动，帮助他们同帝国主义分子进行斗争。天津爱国的天主教徒，到教堂中去演讲三自运动的意义，在各教堂设立签名站征求教徒签名于革新宣言，这些宣传的方法，应为各地爱国的天主教徒所效法。天津天主教革新运动促进会筹备委员会所出版的刊物“广扬”，不仅教育了天津的教徒，而且教育了华北的广大教徒。唐山、绥远、山西等地的教徒，即纷纷写信，要求“广扬”多多介绍天主教的实情，借以提高教徒的政治觉悟。过去，一般天主教徒对于压迫他们的帝国主义分子，一方面痛恨他们，一方面又受着他们的蒙蔽。现在广大的教徒们要求了解天主教的实情了。这实情，就是帝国主义利用天主教进行侵略活动的实情；就是帝国主义分子及其走狗，隐藏在天主教内进行特务活动的实情；就是帝国主义分子在教内挥霍无度，欺压中国神甫与教徒的实情。这些实情一经为他们所了解，他们就会恍然大悟，就会卷入爱国的革新运动中来，同帝国主义分子进行坚决斗争。
    天津天主教革新运动的胜利，还只是初步的胜利，帝国主义分子决不会甘心于自己的失败，他们必然会作垂死挣扎，来破坏革新运动的；因此，天津的爱国教徒，必须提高警惕，继续与帝国主义分子进行斗争，继续教育教徒，不断提高其政治觉悟，巩固与加强团结，把运动推向前进，直到把帝国主义分子在教会中的特权完全推翻，把帝国主义在教会中的势力驱除净尽，使帝国主义者没有可能再来利用教会进行侵略活动为止。
