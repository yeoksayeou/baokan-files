　　Anti-American Aggression Propaganda Deeply Penetrates Poor Citizens in the Qianling East Road Police Station District of Guiyang
The anti-American aggression propaganda work in the Qianling East Road Police Station district of Guiyang City has deeply penetrated the poor working-class citizens. About 5,000 residents in this area have received education on the current affairs of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, accounting for two-thirds of the residents in the entire area. In the propaganda work, 14 activists emerged and seven propagandists were elected by the masses, forming a propaganda organization.
　　More than one-third of the residents in the Qianling East Road Police Station district are rickshaw pullers, flatbed carters, construction workers, and water carriers. They have no fixed rest time, and many are illiterate. Most are not organized. People's representatives from all walks of life in the district and some residents, based on the characteristics of the residents in the district, organized three propaganda groups. Group members study current affairs and politics twice a week. First, they choose a time that does not interfere with the residents' work, and display some anti-American aggression cartoons and comic strips in several residents' homes in rotation; and ask activists among the masses to mobilize everyone to come and see. During the exhibition, the propaganda group sends people to give popular explanations. After everyone becomes interested in the exhibition, the propaganda group starts to establish study organizations and cultivate activists among the masses as the backbone of the study organizations. After this study organization is consolidated, the propaganda group transfers the propaganda cartoons, materials, and books to another place, and then helps the residents there establish a study organization. In this way, the anti-American aggression propaganda is gradually deepened into every corner of the residents. The propaganda group led by Tang Feng, a women's representative in the district, in addition to conducting current affairs education through reading newspapers, comparisons, accusations, and casual talks, also teaches everyone to read. They teach everyone to read while explaining current affairs. Everyone is very interested in learning. Many working women rush to participate after finishing their work at home. The propaganda group has also developed. Tang Feng's group has grown from fifteen to thirty people. The propaganda group also reads newspapers and tells stories in places where working residents rest and gather. When they read newspapers, they explain new terms and important points while reading; and intersperse some local news and new people and new things. In this way, everyone naturally connects with reality and launches into casual talks and accusations.

　  贵阳黔灵东路公安派出所辖区
　  抗美援朝宣传深入贫苦市民
    贵阳市黔灵东路公安派出所辖区的抗美援朝宣传工作，深入贫苦劳动市民。该区受到抗美援朝时事教育的居民约五千多人，占全区居民的三分之二。该区在宣传工作中涌现了十四个积极分子并由群众选出七个宣传员，形成了一个宣传组织。
    黔灵东路公安派出所辖区内的居民有三分之一以上是人力车夫、板车夫、泥水工人和挑水工人。他们没有固定的休息时间。很多人不识字。大部分没有组织起来。该区各界人民代表和一部分居民根据区内居民的特点，组织了三个宣传小组。组员每周学习时事政治两次。他们首先选择不耽误居民干活的时间，把一些有关抗美援朝的漫画和连环画分别在几户居民的家里轮流展览；并要群众中的积极分子动员大家来看。在展览中宣传小组派人作通俗解说。宣传小组等大家对展览发生兴趣以后，就着手建立学习组织；并培养群众中的积极分子作为学习组织的骨干。在这个学习组织巩固之后，宣传小组就把宣传漫画、资料和图书等转移到另一个地方，再帮助那里的居民建立学习组织。这样就把抗美援朝的宣传逐步地深入到每个角落的居民中去。该区的妇女代表唐风领导的宣传小组除经常用读报、对比、控诉和漫谈等方式进行时事教育外，还教大家识字。她们一面教大家识字，一面讲解时事。大家的学习兴趣很高。许多劳动妇女在家里赶着做完活就跑来参加。宣传小组也得到了发展。唐风的小组已由十五人发展到三十人。宣传组还在劳动居民休息和集聚的地方读报和说书。他们读报时，遇到新名词和重要的地方，就边读边讲；并穿插一些本地所发生的新闻与新人新事。这样，大家很自然地联系实际，展开漫谈和控诉。
