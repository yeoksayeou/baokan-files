　　Truman's Clumsy Scheme
    *Pravda* Editorial
    President Truman has ordered the dismissal of General MacArthur from his position as Supreme Commander for the Far East. Yesterday's commander of the Korean intervention forces, the "uncrowned emperor" of Japan—as the American bourgeois press flatteringly called him—finds himself out of power.
    It is noteworthy the deliberately sensational and clamorous manner in which American officials reported the news of MacArthur's dismissal to the public. The announcement was made at a special press conference at the White House (the official residence of the American president) at 1:00 AM Washington time. Even during the Second World War, the White House never held a press conference at such a late hour. President Truman was in such a hurry to let the world know his decision that, according to American newspapers, MacArthur himself learned of his dismissal from a radio broadcast even before receiving the official order transmitted by the Army communications system—the military telegraph.
    MacArthur's dismissal reflects the deepening crisis experienced by America's aggressive foreign policy due to the setbacks suffered by the United States in Korea. There can be no two opinions on this matter. The American imperialists' aggressive gambling policy towards the Far East, primarily towards Korea and the People's Republic of China, has aroused profound dissatisfaction among the broad masses of the American people, which is no secret to anyone.
    This policy has intensified the internal struggles within the American ruling circles and sharply aggravated the contradictions and differences within the American-British bloc.
    The question then arises: why did the White House have to make such a fuss about MacArthur's dismissal? The answer to this question can be easily found in Truman's broadcast speech on April 11 regarding MacArthur's dismissal. Truman's speech clearly shows that there is a reason for making such a big deal about MacArthur's dismissal. Here, we see a poorly conceived scheme. The purpose of this scheme, which Truman thought of, is first and foremost to portray the crisis in American foreign policy as some kind of "personal crisis" of MacArthur's. Truman attempts to shift the responsibility for the policy he has been pursuing with the knowledge, consent, and instructions of the American ruling circles onto MacArthur.
    But this is not President Truman's only purpose. He also attempts to gain political capital and shirk his own responsibility for the overall international tension, which has been largely caused by America's aggressive policy in the Far East and its continued aggression against the Korean people and the People's Republic of China. Truman, employing his usual tactic of shifting blame, vainly attempts to make it appear as if the responsibility for the current international tension in the Far East does not lie with the American ruling circles, but with peace-loving countries, primarily the Soviet Union.
    President Truman would be correct if it were Soviet troops, not American troops, that were invading Korea, and if it were Soviet troops, not American troops, that were occupying the Chinese territory of Taiwan Island. However, Soviet troops have always remained and still remain on Soviet territory, while it is precisely American troops that, at the President's command, are violating Korea and, likewise at Truman's command, are seizing Taiwan. This is too bad for Truman. What can Mr. Truman use to refute these facts? Is it not clear that the responsibility for the tension in the Far East rests entirely with Mr. Truman and his government? Therefore, Mr. Truman's attempt to shift the responsibility for his own mistakes onto the Soviet government can only evoke laughter.
    Mr. Truman attempts to pin the blame of aggression on the Korean people. Let us look at the facts.
    The whole world knows that the troops of Syngman Rhee, on the orders of the American ruling circles, attacked the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and then the American armed forces intervened. Irrefutable and undeniable documents confirming the acts of aggression by the troops of Syngman Rhee and the American armed forces have been submitted to the United Nations and widely published. Some of these documents have been published in a special collection compiled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. President Truman must already know these documents. We can also recall certain facts. For example, Johnson, the head of the ECA's Korean branch, stated in a speech to the House Appropriations Committee on May 19, 1950, that the 100,000 troops of South Korea, equipped with American weapons and trained by the American military advisory group, were fully prepared and could begin combat at any time. It was at this time that Syngman Rhee declared in the newspapers that May and June would be the most critical months in Korean history. Let us also recall Dulles's speech to the South Korean National Assembly on June 19, six days before the attack on North Korea. He said that the United States was willing to give South Korea all necessary spiritual and material support. In a letter to Syngman Rhee on June 20, 1950, Dulles emphasized the role assigned to Korea in the upcoming events. He wrote that he greatly valued the decisive role that Korea could play in the great drama that was unfolding.
    Contrary to the truthful and well-documented materials (which prove that the aggression was launched by Syngman Rhee's troops under the direct instigation of the American ruling circles), Truman, in order to justify his theory that American troops have the right to remain in Korea, finds false documents from the archives and insists that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea committed aggression. What is the basis for the President's words? Due to a lack of well-documented materials (because such materials do not exist), Truman uses excerpts from what he calls "secret intelligence," talking about speeches by some mysterious "North Korean communist officers." It is on these God-knows-what "bases" that Truman accuses the Korean people, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, of aggression. In the end, Truman has another "secret intelligence" in which a mysterious "Far East communist officer" appears. According to Truman, this mysterious figure, who has neither rank nor nationality, advocates "the long-awaited world revolution." Based on these crudely fabricated and poorly conceived materials, Truman concludes that "Communist leaders want to control... all of Asia." It is not difficult to see that the "arguments" derived from these poorly conceived fabricated materials put the American President in a ridiculous position. He bases his entire concept on such dubious "sources" to justify his aggressive policy in Korea; and not only justifies the further continuation of this aggressive policy, but also paves the way for it; as a result, the American President is placed in an even more ridiculous position.
    What is the purpose of Truman fabricating the so-called "Communist aggression" in the Far East and reiterating it in every possible way? It is to confuse world public opinion, deceive the people of all countries, and portray the current bandit-like war of aggression waged by the United States and its vassals in Korea as a struggle against aggression.
    Everyone knows that the American interventionist forces are not only trying to seize Korea, but also trying to invade Northeast China and attack the People's Republic of China. The heroic struggle of the Korean people and the Chinese volunteer forces has thwarted these criminal conspiracies. The interventionists' plans have failed. Having no ability to implement these bandit-like plans, the unlucky MacArthur was removed from his post. He was unable to cope with the situation in Korea—this is the reason why MacArthur's career came to a shameful end.
    What does President Truman say? He attempts to make it appear as if it is thanks to Truman and his government that the war on the Korean training ground has not expanded beyond Korea. It is said that MacArthur was removed precisely because he wanted to expand the war and use the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to attack China.
    Truman attempts to portray what was done out of necessity as something done willingly. He describes the disastrous defeat of the military gamble in Korea as a "victory." He shamelessly distorts the facts to such an extent that he says that aggression against the Korean people is... the "best way" to prevent a Third World War. Indeed, absurdity to this extent can be said to have reached its peak.
    The President is so carried away with his nonsensical arguments that he repeatedly puts himself in an embarrassing position. For example, in order to prove that the United States is not expanding the Korean War out of its own volition, he pretends to ask rhetorically: why don't we bomb Northeast China and mainland China? Why don't we help the Chinese Kuomintang troops land on the Chinese mainland? Truman's first question is not worth a smile. Isn't it known to everyone that the American Air Force continues to carry out provocative attacks on Chinese territory? According to Xinhua News Agency, on March 30, American aircraft invaded Antung, Lagu Shao, and Ji'an County, dropping bombs; from 19:00 on March 30 to 3:00 on March 31, American aircraft invaded Chinese airspace 17 times in a row; on March 31, American aircraft dropped 30 bombs in Linjiang County; on April 7, American bombers bombed Antung again. This is the factual answer to Truman's first question.
    As for the second question, about helping the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang land on the Chinese mainland, the key is that Truman has no say in the matter. Truman knows very well that the American people want peace, and they are very alarmed by the prospect of another world war that the American ruling circles are plotting. It is precisely for this reason that President Truman tirelessly and repeatedly assures that he longs for peace, and that his entire mind is focused on how to prevent a Third World War.
    However,... flimsy threads are bound to break. President Truman attempts to shift the responsibility onto peace-loving countries, who, according to him, should "change their policies." But the President remains silent about the peace proposals made by the People's Republic of China in the past. He merely says, pointlessly, that the United States is always willing to peacefully resolve the conflict. However, empty words without action are useless.
    One can ask: what steps does the United States intend to take to seek a peaceful resolution to the war? MacArthur has been dismissed, but will American troops be withdrawn from Korea accordingly? The facts show that this is not the case. We see these words in Truman's speech: "The change in the Far East command does not mean any change in American policy. We will continue to wage the Korean War with perseverance and determination, so that the war will be brought to a victorious end quickly." This proves the American President's attitude. Based on this statement by Truman, the hypocrisy of his usual guarantees of striving for a peaceful resolution of the war and preventing war is exposed.
    No matter how Truman tries to absolve himself of the responsibility for aggression against Korea and preparing for another world war, it is all in vain. He cannot shirk this responsibility no matter what. Neither his false statements nor his sensational decision to replace MacArthur can save him.

　　杜鲁门的笨拙计策
    苏联真理报社论
    杜鲁门总统下令免除了麦克阿瑟将军的远东总司令的职位。昨天的朝鲜干涉军总司令、日本的“无冕皇帝”——美国资产阶级报纸这样诌媚地称呼他——发现自己已经失势了。
    值得注意的是美国官方人士向舆论界报道麦克阿瑟被革职的消息时所用的故意耸人听闻的方式，大喊大叫的方式。这个消息是在华盛顿时间上午一时，在白宫（美国总统的官邸）的特别记者招待会上宣布的。即使在第二次世界大战中，白宫也从来没有在这样晚的时间举行过记者招待会。杜鲁门总统是这样急忙地要让全世界知道他的决定，据美国报纸报道，麦克阿瑟本人甚至在没有接到陆军通讯系统——即军用电报——所传送的官方命令之前，就从无线电的广播中得知他被撤职。
    由于美国在朝鲜所遭到的失利，美国的侵略性的外交政策已经走到了绝路，麦克阿瑟的被撤职，正反映了美国的侵略性外交政策所经历的日益加深的危机。对于这个问题不可能有两种意见。美帝国主义对远东首先是对朝鲜和中华人民共和国的侵略性赌博政策引起了美国广大人民的深刻的不满，这对任何人都不是秘密了。
    这一政策使得美国统治集团的内部斗争加剧，使美、英集团阵营中的矛盾和分歧急剧地尖锐化。
    问题就发生了：为什么白宫一定要在麦克阿瑟撤职的事情上这样大喊大叫呢？这个问题的答案，可以很容易地在杜鲁门四月十一日就麦克阿瑟撤职事发表的广播演说中找到。杜鲁门的演说清楚地说明，在麦克阿瑟撤职的事情上大惊小怪，不是没有原因的。在这里，我们看到一个策划得很不高明的计谋。杜鲁门所想的这个计谋的目的，首先是把美国外交政策的危机说成是麦克阿瑟的某种“个人的危机”。杜鲁门企图把他在美国统治集团的知悉、同意和指示下所奉行的政策的责任，放到麦克阿瑟身上。
    但这并不是杜鲁门总统唯一的目的。他也企图获得政治资本，并推卸他自己对于全面国际紧张局势的责任，这个紧张局势在很大程度上是由美国在远东的侵略政策和继续侵略朝鲜人民及中华人民共和国所造成的。杜鲁门采用他惯用的诿过于人的办法，徒然地企图把事情说得好像是目前远东国际紧张局势的责任不在于美国统治集团，而在于爱好和平的国家，首先是苏联。
    如果侵略朝鲜的是苏联军队而不是美国军队的话，如果占领中国领土——台湾岛的是苏联军队而不是美国军队的话，杜鲁门总统会是正确的。但是，苏联军队一向而且仍然留在苏联的领土上，而奉总统之命侵犯朝鲜的以及同样地奉杜鲁门之命攫夺台湾的，却正是美国的部队。这对杜鲁门来说是太糟了。杜鲁门先生能用什么来反驳这些事实呢？远东紧张局势的责任完全应该由杜鲁门先生及其政府来担负，难道还不明白吗？因此，杜鲁门先生要想把他自己的错误的责任转嫁到苏联政府身上的企图，只能引人一笑。
    杜鲁门先生企图把侵略罪名加在朝鲜人民身上，让我们来看看事实吧。
    全世界都知道：李承晚的军队奉美国统治集团的命令进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，跟着，美国武装部队就来干涉。证实李承晚军队和美国武装部队的侵略事实的、任何人也驳不倒的、无可争辩的文件，已经送交联合国并且广泛地公布了。这些文件中有一些已发表在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省所编的专集中。杜鲁门总统一定已经知道这些文件。我们也可以把某些事实追述一下。例如，美国经合总署朝鲜分署署长琼逊，在一九五○年五月十九日，在美国国会众院拨款委员会演说时称：以美国武器装备并由美国军事顾问团训练的南朝鲜的十万军队，已经完成准备，并能随时开始作战。正是在这个时候，李承晚在报上声称，五、六月将是朝鲜历史上的最危急的月份。让我们也来追述一下杜勒斯在进攻北朝鲜前六天即六月十九日向南朝鲜国民议会发表的演说。他说，美国愿意给南朝鲜一切必要的精神上与物质上的支持。杜勒斯在一九五○年六月二十日致李承晚的信中，强调在即将到来的事件中派给朝鲜的任务。他写道，他极为重视朝鲜在正在演出的伟大戏剧中所能扮演的决定性的角色。
    与真实的确凿有据的材料相反（这些材料证明侵略是李承晚军队在美国统治集团的直接唆使下发动的），杜鲁门为了证明他的美国军队有权留在朝鲜的理论，就从档案中找出虚假的文件，硬说朝鲜民主主义人民共和国侵略。总统的话根据什么呢？由于缺少确凿有据的材料（因为这种材料并不存在），杜鲁门就应用他所说的《秘密谍报》的摘录，谈到某种神秘的“北朝鲜共军军官”的演说。杜鲁门就是以这些天知道的“根据”给朝鲜人民、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国加上侵略的罪名。到头来，杜鲁门还有一个《秘密谍报》，神秘的“远东共军军官”又在其中出现。据杜鲁门说，这个既没有官阶又没有国籍的神秘人物，鼓吹“等待已久的世界革命”。根据这种粗制滥造的和不高明的捏造材料，杜鲁门得出结论说：“共产党领袖要想控制……全亚洲。”不难看到，这种从不高明的捏造材料中所得出的“论据”，使美国总统处于荒谬可笑的地位。他根据这种可疑的“消息来源”，杜撰出整个概念，来辩解他在朝鲜的侵略政策；并且，不仅仅为进一步继续实行这个侵略政策辩解，而且为它铺平道路；其结果，美国总统就更加处在荒谬可笑的地位。
    杜鲁门捏造所谓“共产党侵略”远东的说法并且用一切可能方式加以重申，是为了什么目的？为了迷惑世界舆论，欺骗各国人民，把目前美国及其附庸国在朝鲜进行的强盗式的侵略战争说成是反对侵略的斗争。
    大家都知道，美国干涉军不但力图攫取朝鲜，并且力图侵犯中国东北，进攻中华人民共和国。朝鲜人民和中国志愿部队的英勇斗争挫败了这些罪恶的阴谋。干涉分子的计划已经失败了。由于没有能力实施这些强盗式的计划，倒霉的麦克阿瑟被撤免职务。他没有能力应付朝鲜的局势——这便是麦克阿瑟的生涯归于可耻结束的原因。
    杜鲁门总统是怎样说的呢？他企图把问题说成是，假如朝鲜练兵场上的战争不扩展到朝鲜境外，那是杜鲁门和他的政府的功劳。据说：麦克阿瑟正是因为要扩大战争，要利用蒋介石匪帮来进攻中国，所以才被撤掉的。
    杜鲁门企图把出于不得已的事情说成心甘情愿的事情。他把在朝鲜的军事赌博的惨败形容为“胜利”。他愈来愈不要脸地任意歪曲事实，竟然到了这种地步：说什么侵略朝鲜人民是……防止第三次世界大战的“最好办法”。的确，荒谬到这种程度也可说是登峰造极的了。
    总统对于他那套不通的说法是那么得意忘形，以致一再弄得狼狈不堪。譬如，他为了证明美国不扩大朝鲜战争是出于自愿，便假意地反问道：我们为什么不轰炸中国东北和中国本部呢？我们为什么不帮助中国国民党军队在中国大陆登陆呢？杜鲁门的第一个问题不值一笑。美国空军继续对中国领土进行挑衅性的袭击，难道不是每个人都知道的吗？据新华通讯社消息，三月三十日，美国飞机侵入安东、拉古哨和辑安县，投了炸弹；三月三十日十九时至三十一日三时，美国飞机一连侵犯中国领空十七次；三月三十一日，美国飞机在临江县投弹三十枚；四月七日，美国轰炸机再度轰炸安东。这便是事实对杜鲁门第一个问题的回答。
    至于第二个问题，关于帮助蒋介石匪帮在中国大陆登陆的问题，那末关键在于这完全是杜鲁门作不得主的。杜鲁门很晓得，美国人民要和平，他们对于美国统治集团正在谋划的另一世界大战的远景感到非常惊慌。正因为这个缘故，杜鲁门总统才不厌烦地屡屡保证说，他渴望和平，又说他全部心思都是集中在怎样防止第三次世界大战上。
    但是，……不结实的线总免不了要断的。杜鲁门总统企图把责任推卸在爱好和平的国家身上，据他说这些国家应该“改变它们的政策”。但是对于中华人民共和国过去所提出的和平建议，总统却一声也不响。他只是无聊地说，美国随时愿意和平解决冲突。但是，没有行动表现的空话是不中用的。
    人们可以问：为求和平解决战争，美国打算采取什么步骤呢？麦克阿瑟是被撤职了，但是美国军队是不是会随着撤出朝鲜呢？事实表明情形并不是这样。我们从杜鲁门的演说中看到这些话：“远东统帅的更动，并不意味着美国政策有任何改变。我们将继续以毅力和决心进行朝鲜战争，以使战争迅速达到胜利的结束。”这就证明了美国总统的态度。根据杜鲁门这个声明看，他平时所说的争取战争和平解决及防止战争的一些保证的虚伪性便暴露无遗了。
    杜鲁门无论怎样企图为自己开脱侵略朝鲜及准备另一次世界大战的责任，终归是徒然的。他无论如何也推脱不了这责任。不论是他的虚伪声明或是他撤换麦克阿瑟的震动一时的决定都救不了他。
