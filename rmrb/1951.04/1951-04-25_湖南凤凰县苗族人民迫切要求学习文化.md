    Miao People in Fenghuang County, Hunan Province, Eagerly Demand to Learn Culture
    To the Editor:
    I am writing to inform you about the urgent desire of the Miao compatriots in Fenghuang County, Hunan Province, to learn culture.
    Fenghuang County is a place where Miao compatriots live in concentrated communities. In the past, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang's Han chauvinism, Miao compatriots lived in hunger, cold, and disease, and there was no question of learning culture.
    After liberation, the Miao people were emancipated. The People's Government annihilated the bandits, and led the Miao people in some key areas to overthrow the local bullies, distribute the fruits of victory, and have the conditions to develop production. As life gradually improved, the Miao people's demand to learn culture has also been increasing day by day. Since February 1st of this year, there have been more than twenty cases in which various villages in the second district of Fenghuang County have requested the district government to add primary schools. The number of students in each primary school is now ten times more than in previous years. For example, Wuben Primary School only had seven or eight students in previous years, but recently it suddenly increased to more than 130. There are now 426 students in the border area primary school, and the number is still increasing. Miao girls aged fifteen or sixteen, who did not dare to show their faces in the past, now dare to come out to school in their colorful clothes. After Miao citizen Long ?guang received two shi of grain after the distribution, he quickly took out five sheng of rice and bought books for his "ya zai" (i.e., children). On the day he sent his child to school, he said with a smile to everyone he met: "In the first half of last year, my ya zai was still begging for rice. I never thought that this year he could go to school. We are truly liberated!"

### 湖南凤凰县苗族人民迫切要求学习文化

    湖南凤凰县苗族人民迫切要求学习文化编辑同志：
    我把湖南省凤凰县苗族同胞迫切要求学习文化的情况告诉你们。
    凤凰县是苗族同胞聚居的地方。在过去国民党大汉族主义反动统治下，苗族同胞生活在饥寒疾病之中，根本谈不上学习文化。
    解放后，苗民翻身了。人民政府剿灭了土匪，领导部分重点区的苗民斗倒了恶霸，分得了果实，有了发展生产的条件。生活逐渐好转了，苗民学习文化的要求也就日渐提高。从今年二月一日起，凤凰县二区各寨先后向区政府要求增设小学的就有二十多起。各小学现有学生人数比往年多了十倍。如务本小学校往年只有七八个学生，最近突然增加到一百三十多人。边区小学现在已有四百二十六个学生，还在继续增加。十五六岁的苗族姑娘，过去不敢露面，现在也敢穿着花衣裳出来上学了。苗民龙?光在分得两石果实谷子后，赶紧拿出五升米，替牙崽（即小孩子）买了书。在他送孩子上学那天，逢人便笑嘻嘻地说：“去年上半年，我牙崽还在讨米，想不到今年可以上学堂了。咱们这才真叫翻了身呀！”
