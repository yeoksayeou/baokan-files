　　How did the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Implement the Central Committee's Decision to Establish a Propaganda Network?
    By the Propaganda Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    After the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued its decision on establishing a propaganda network for the masses throughout the Party, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately arranged for the entire Party to study and discuss this decision. Soon after, the Provincial Committee, based on the Central Committee's decision and the spirit of the Northeast Bureau's decision on implementing the Central Committee's decision, formulated a six-month work plan and wrote an article published in the Heilongjiang Daily to mobilize the entire Party to pay attention to this work. At the province's Third Party Congress, repeated discussions were held, calling on Party organizations and members throughout the province to earnestly study the aforementioned decision and strive to implement it. At the same time, it severely criticized the erroneous thinking of some people who belittled the work of the propaganda network, regarding its establishment as merely a temporary task for a few people. Through these efforts, the vast majority of municipal and county Party committees, and some grassroots Party organizations, have begun to attach importance to propaganda work, and have begun to recognize that establishing a propaganda network is an important step in improving the Party's leadership, and is a fundamental method for overcoming commandism and strengthening ties between the Party and the masses. According to statistics from the provincial propaganda chiefs' meeting on March 4th, and recent reports from county Party committees on the establishment of the propaganda network, 29 of the 42 cities and counties in the province have specifically discussed the issue of propaganda network work, and reviewed past propaganda network work. Local meetings have also formulated implementation measures based on local conditions, and convened district committee-level or branch secretary meetings, or equivalent Party meetings, to convey the information to grassroots organizations. However, some county Party committees did not earnestly discuss and convey the Central Committee's decision, and failed to formulate specific plans to realize this decision, thus failing to quickly realize this decision throughout the county. This shows that these Party committees have not adequately understood the spirit of the Central Committee's decision to establish a propaganda network, and their attitude towards implementing the Central Committee's decision is not serious and conscientious enough. Four counties even failed to convey and discuss the decisions of the Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, as well as the Provincial Committee's implementation plan.

  Two Attitudes and Two Approaches to Implementing the Central Committee's Decision

    From our understanding, there are two different approaches to conveying and discussing the Central Committee's decision in various regions, resulting in two different effects and yielding two sets of experiences and lessons. One approach is to earnestly study and discuss the Central Committee's decision, and use the spirit of the Central Committee's decision to review and summarize past propaganda network work, identify problems, draw lessons, and thus recognize the significance of establishing a regular propaganda work system, formulate a specific plan for establishing a propaganda network, and strive to realize this decision in actual work, achieving preliminary results. The other attitude is to adopt a perfunctory attitude towards establishing a propaganda network, completely contrary to the above attitude, failing to earnestly study the decisions of the Central Committee and higher levels. When Nehe County's seven county committees discussed and approved the work plan for establishing the propaganda network, four county committees had not even seen the plan, and therefore passed it in a careless manner, resulting in it being unworkable. Some county propaganda chiefs even said: The system stipulated by the Central Committee is too strict and too numerous, which is somewhat troublesome. This is a manifestation of not being serious about the Central Committee's decision and lacking a strong Party spirit. This is a lack of basic knowledge of the Party's propaganda work, as well as a lack of the basic conditions and necessary political awareness of a Party member. This must be brought to the serious attention of Party organizations at all levels.

  Through Propaganda, the Party's Connection with the People Has Moved Forward a Step

    Based on the spirit of the Central Committee's decision, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party reviewed past propaganda network work. Through a year of experimentation and creation last year, Heilongjiang Province's propaganda network work has achieved initial results. The propaganda network work has played a significant role in inspiring the people's determination and confidence in resisting America and aiding Korea, and in carrying out patriotic production emulation campaigns in urban and rural areas, and has established a preliminary foundation in the organization of the propaganda network. Eighty-one percent of the branches in the province have established propaganda networks, and a number of outstanding propagandists have emerged. Because the Party has such a propaganda network, the Party's connection with the people has moved forward a step, and the Party's leadership style has also greatly improved. However, on the other hand, it has also exposed many problems that still exist in Heilongjiang's propaganda network work. The most important of these is that most Party organizations have not yet established a leadership and management system for propagandists; they have not yet provided propagandists with a large amount of propaganda materials, and have not yet summarized the work of propagandists in a timely manner. Therefore, the role of propagandists cannot be actively brought into play. A large part of the propagandists have a simple task-oriented view of "propaganda when a task comes, and forget about it when it's gone," and a small part of the propagandists in districts and villages are not pure enough, and some are even falsely reported. The organization of the provincial propaganda network can generally be divided into three categories: The first category is those who can play a regular role. According to statistics from 22 counties, one city, and one Party committee, there are 4,820 propagandists who can play a regular role, accounting for 17.1% of all propagandists; the second category is those who are of good quality and whose selection procedures comply with the Central Committee's regulations, but due to weak leadership, their propaganda to the masses is intermittent, and they publicize for a while after a task is assigned, and then stop, with 18,777 people, accounting for 66.8% of all propagandists; the third category is propagandists who do not meet the standards stipulated by the Central Committee, which can be divided into two types, one is hooligans who have no prestige among the masses or are of poor quality, or those with unclear political backgrounds and political problems, and the other is those who were not reviewed and approved by the Party branch committee, but were elected or selected at people's congresses or mass meetings. Therefore, there are no cadres in these areas, and very few Party members and Youth League members, and the vast majority are masses. These masses are mostly people who are eloquent or honest and kind in the countryside, and the district committee approves them as propagandists, and some of them do not even know that they are propagandists. There are a total of 4,524 people in the above category, accounting for 16.1% of the total number of propagandists. This is formalism in the establishment of the propaganda network, and it is a manifestation of the simple task-oriented view in the establishment of the propaganda network. When inspecting the work of the propaganda network, various counties have begun to rectify and cleanse this type of propagandist. On the other hand, new problems have occurred in areas that have already paid attention to the work of propagandists. According to our understanding in Qiqihar City and Tailai County, after everyone further recognized the importance of propaganda work, various departments and units demanded that propagandists simply publicize the tasks of their own units, which is not right. Propagandists must be educated to be good at combining current events and policies with the county's specific tasks for propaganda. Otherwise, it will be impossible to complete the task, and it is easy to go astray.

  Establishing Propagandist Training Stations to Strengthen Education for Propagandists

    Establishing propagandist training stations is an important link in enabling rural propagandists to play a regular role and in improving and consolidating the organization of the propaganda network. Nehe County has established training stations for a relatively long time, and has received greater results. Preliminary experience has been gained: First, grasping the characteristics that propagandists have low political and cultural levels and poor acceptance ability, the content of training must be clear and simple, with the principle of being less but refined, so as to prevent the phenomenon of not being able to digest too much. Second, the content of each training session should be combined with the current central work, and investigations and research should be conducted in advance, and explanations should be given in light of the ideological situation and other problems of the local masses, so that the effect will be greater. Third, district committee members should be specifically assigned to be responsible, and the district committee should provide unified leadership, so that the training work can be regular. Fourth, the combination of teaching and discussion and trial teaching, that is, after teaching the content of the propaganda, select several propagandists to give speeches on the spot or to the masses, and organize all propagandists to discuss this further, promoting the correct ones and correcting the wrong ones, so as to strengthen the further and profound understanding of the teaching content, and also deepen the memory. Fifth, the combination of teaching and summarizing work is the most effective way to improve the level of propagandists and to strengthen their understanding of the teaching content.

  The Province Established More Than 1,000 Rapporteurs to Publicize the Issue of Opposing the United States' Arming of Japan

    Heilongjiang Province has established more than 1,000 rapporteurs. Among the 42 rapporteurs at the provincial level, including all members of the Provincial Committee and the heads and deputy heads of various departments and commissions, and the main responsible Party member cadres of the provincial government at the director level and various mass organizations. Among the city and county-level rapporteurs, there are city and county committee members, government section chief level and the main Party member cadres of various mass organizations. Some of the Party committees and general branches in industrial and mining enterprises and the rural district committees have formally determined rapporteurs, the former are all Party committee members, and the latter, some counties have considered that some district committee members are illiterate and it is difficult to be competent, and have not been determined as rapporteurs. According to statistics from 21 cities and counties, there are already 1,113 rapporteurs (including 667 district-level rapporteurs, 378 county-level rapporteurs, 26 city-level rapporteurs, and 42 provincial-level rapporteurs). The Provincial Committee has formulated working regulations for provincial-level rapporteurs; cities and counties have also established a rapporteur working system. In the propaganda campaign to oppose the United States' imperialism arming Japan and universally signing patriotic covenants, most of the provincial and municipal rapporteurs made political reports on radio stations, cadre meetings, representative meetings, organized mass gathering places, and propagandist conferences. Qiqihar City's rapporteurs divided the work according to the various classes of organs, factories, cultural centers, schools, industry and commerce, and fixed responsibilities. In addition to reporting current affairs policies to their assigned objects once a month, they also went to report temporarily when there were temporary tasks. Due to this division of labor, it has begun to promote a closer connection between some rapporteurs and a certain number of the masses. The establishment of rapporteurs has greatly promoted the work of propagandists. The propagandists reflected that "with rapporteurs, we are also more confident in our propaganda work." However, since the establishment of rapporteurs is a new task, and there is a lack of experience, there are many shortcomings and problems. The following shortcomings have occurred in Qiqihar City: (1) The reports of some rapporteurs have not been reviewed and approved by the secretary of the Provincial Committee, so some problems have occurred in individual reports. The original regulations required reporting on opposing the United States' imperialism arming Japan, but individual rapporteurs talked about other issues. And there are errors in the wording. In the future, it must be ensured that the content of the report is designated or reviewed and approved by the secretary of the Provincial Committee, and report after the report. On the same content of the report, a forum can be organized to exchange speaking outlines. (2) Because the ideological situation of cadres and the masses is not adequately investigated and grasped on weekdays, and the work of supplying materials is not done well, some reports are empty and generalized, and cannot fully exert the due effect. This should be paid attention to in the future.

    Heilongjiang Province has gained the following three experiences in the work of rapporteurs: First, after the rapporteur is reviewed and approved by the Party committee, a series of organizational work must be done accordingly; the division of labor should be strict, the report objects should be determined, the propaganda plan should be formulated, and the working system should be stipulated, so as to effectively play the role of each rapporteur. Otherwise, the work of the rapporteur will become a formality. Second, rapporteurs at all levels should constantly understand the ideological situation of the masses and cadres, and prepare the content of the report based on these ideological situations, so as to make their reports lively and effective. For example, Zheng Xuekong, Minister of the Organization Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, convened a forum of branch secretaries and branch members from 15 factories before giving a report to workers on opposing the United States' imperialism arming Japan to understand the workers' ideological situation, and then gave a report in light of these ideological situations, which was very effective. Third, the content of the rapporteur's report should be consistent with the propaganda task of the propagandist. After the rapporteur reports, the Party organization can organize the propagandist to conduct discussions and studies, and then go to the masses to publicize. Experience has proved that this combination is particularly effective in propaganda. However, it is also necessary to prevent the tendency of propagandists to recite the rapporteur's report to the masses.

　　中共黑龙江省委怎样执行中央建立宣传网决定的？
    中共黑龙江省委宣传部
    中共中央发布关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网决定后，中共黑龙江省委员会立即布置全党学习和讨论这一决定。不久，省委又根据中央决定和东北局关于贯彻中央决定的决定精神，制订了半年的工作计划。并撰写论文在黑龙江日报上发表，动员全党注意这一工作。在省的第三届党代表会议上，又进行了反复讨论，号召全省党的组织、党员，认真研究上述决定，努力加以贯彻。同时严肃地批判了一部分人轻视宣传网工作，把建立宣传网工作看作只是少数人的临时性工作的错误思想。经过这些努力，全省绝大部分市县党委和一些党的基层组织，已开始重视宣传工作，开始认识建立宣传网就是改进党的领导的一个重要步骤，是克服命令主义，密切党和群众关系的根本方法。据三月四日全省宣传部长会议上的调查统计，和最近各县县委关于建立宣传网的报告，全省四十二个市县中，已有二十九个市县委专门讨论了宣传网工作的问题，检查了过去的宣传网工作。各地会议并针对本地情况，制定了实施办法，召开区委级或支部书记会议，或党的相当会议，传达到基层组织中去。但是，也有一些县委，没有认真讨论与传达中央的决定，未能定出实现这一决定的具体计划，因而不能迅速在全县范围内实现这一决定。这说明了这些党委对中央建立宣传网决定的精神还领会不够，执行中央决定的态度还不够严肃认真。有四个县，甚至根本没有传达和讨论中央与东北局的决定，以及省委的实施计划。
  贯彻中央决定的两种态度两种作法
    据我们了解：在各地传达讨论中央决定时，有两种不同的作法，因而产生了两种不同的效果，得到两条经验教训。一种是认真学习与讨论中央决定。并以中央决定的精神，检查与总结以往的宣传网工作，发现了问题，得出了经验教训，从而认识了建立经常的宣传工作制度的意义，制定出建立宣传网的具体计划，并在实际工作中，努力地实现这一决定，取得了初步的成绩。另一种态度则对建立宣传网采取了敷衍塞责的态度。完全与上述态度相反，不认真研究中央与上级的决定。讷河七个县委讨论、通过建立宣传网工作计划时，竟有四个县委未看过这一计划，因此是马马虎虎地通过了，结果行不通。甚至有的县委宣传部长说：中央规定的制度太严密，太繁多，有些麻烦。这是对中央决定不严肃与党性不强的表现。这是对党的宣传工作缺乏起码知识，也是缺乏一个党员的起码条件和必要的政治觉悟的表现。必须引起各级党的组织严重的注意。
  经过宣传，党与人民群众联系前进了一步
    中共黑龙江省委根据中央决定精神，检查了过去的宣传网工作。经过去年一年的试验与创造，黑龙江省的宣传网工作已取得初步成绩。宣传网工作在启发人民群众抗美援朝的决心信心、开展城乡爱国主义生产竞赛运动中，已经起了相当大的推动作用，在宣传网的组织上已有了初步基础。全省已有百分之八十一的支部建立了宣传网，并且涌现出一部分优秀宣传员。由于党有了这样的宣传网，党与人民群众的联系已前进一步，党的领导作风也有很大的改进。但是，在另一方面，也暴露出黑龙江宣传网工作中还存在不少问题。其中最主要的是：大部分党的组织，还没有建立起对宣传员的领导管理制度；还没有大量供给宣传员以宣传资料，还没有及时总结宣传员的工作。因此，还不能积极发挥宣传员的作用。有很大一部分宣传员存在着“来了任务就宣传，没了就算”的单纯任务观点，有一小部分区、村宣传员的成分还不够纯洁，有的还是虚报挂名的。现在省宣传网的组织，大体可化为三类：第一类是能够经常起作用的，根据二十二个县、一个市、一个党委的统计，能经常起作用的宣传员有四千八百二十名，占全部宣传员的百分之十七点一；第二类质量尚好，挑选手续也合乎中央规定，但因领导不强，他们对群众的宣传时断时续，布置一个任务宣传一阵，过去就拉倒的，有一万八千七百七十七名，占全部宣传员百分之六十六点八；第三类是不合乎中央规定标准的宣传员，其中还可分成两种，一种是在群众里没有威信，或是品质不良的二流子，或是政治面貌不清和政治上有问题者，一种不是党的支部委员会审查通过，而是在人民代表会议或群众大会上选举或挑选的。因此，这些地区的宣传员中没有干部，也很少有党员和团员，绝大部分是群众。这些群众又多系农村里能说会道的或老实厚道的人，区委批准他们作宣传员，他们有的还不知道自己是宣传员。上述一类共有四千五百二十四名，占全体宣传员总数的百分之十六点一。这是建立宣传网中的形式主义，是建立宣传网中的单纯任务观点的表现。在检查宣传网工作时，各县已开始整顿和清洗此类宣传员。另一方面，在已经注意宣传员工作的地区，发生了新的问题。根据我们在齐齐哈尔市和泰来县的了解，在大家进一步认识了宣传工作的重要性后，各部门各单位都要求宣传员单纯宣传本单位的任务，这是不对的。必须教育宣传员，善于把时事与政策和县里的具体任务结合起来宣传。否则无法完成任务，并容易发生偏向。
  建立宣传员传授站加强对宣传员的教育
    建立宣传员传授站是使农村宣传员能够经常起作用，是提高巩固宣传网组织的重要一环。讷河县建立传授站时间较长，收到的效果较大。并已取得初步经验：第一是抓住宣传员政治文化水平低接受能力差的特点，在传授内容上，必须明确简单，以少而精为原则，这样可以防止发生讲多了，消化不了的现象。第二是每次传授内容要结合当前中心工作，事前进行调查研究，针对当地群众的思想状况及其他问题，进行讲解，收效才大。第三，区委委员要具体分工负责，区委会要统一领导，才能使传授工作经常。第四，传授与讨论试教结合进行，即传授完宣传内容之后，选择数名宣传员或者当场讲演，或者向群众讲演，组织全体宣传员就此再展开讨论，发扬正确的，纠正错误的，借以加强对传授内容的进一步深刻了解，也加深了记忆。第五是传授与总结工作相结合，是提高宣传员水平，也是加强其对传授内容的了解最为有效的办法。
  全省建立了一千余名报告员宣传反对美国武装日本问题
    黑龙江省已建立了一千多名报告员。在省级的四十二名报告员中，包括省委全体与各部委正副部长，省人民政府厅长级及各群众团体主要负责的党员干部。在市县一级报告员中，有市县委员，政府科长级与各群众团体主要党员干部。在工矿企业党委与总支和农村区委已有一部分正式确定了报告员，前者都是党委委员，后者有的县考虑到有的区委委员因为不识字，实难胜任，而未确定为报告员。据二十一个市县统计已有报告员一千一百十三名（包括区级报告员六百六十七名，县级三百七十八名，市级二十六名，省级四十二名），省委制定了省级报告员工作条例；市县也建立了报告员工作制度。在反对美帝国主义武装日本普遍订立爱国公约的宣传运动中，省市报告员大部分在广播电台上、干部会上、代表会上，有组织的群众集会场所，宣传员大会上作了政治报告。齐齐哈尔市报告员按机关、工厂、文化馆、学校、工商等各阶层分了工，固定负责，除每月必须向其所分对象，报告一次时事政策外，并做到有临时任务临时去报告。由于这种分工，已开始促使一部分报告员与一定数量的群众有了较密切的联系。报告员的建立，对宣传员工作推动很大。宣传员反映说：“有了报告员我们宣传工作也有把握了。”但是由于建立报告员是一件新工作，缺乏经验，因此存在很多缺点和问题。在齐齐哈尔市曾发生过如下缺点：（一）有的报告员的报告未经省委书记审查批准，因而在个别报告中发生了一些问题，原来规定报告反对美帝国主义武装日本，而个别报告员却讲了别的问题。并有词句上的错误。今后必须作到报告内容由省委书记指定，或审查批准，报告后汇报，在相同的报告内容上，可组织座谈会与交换讲话提纲。（二）由于平时调查掌握干部与群众的思想状况不够，又加供给资料工作作的不好，因而发生有些报告的内容空泛一般化，不能充分发挥应有的效果，这是今后应该注意的问题。
    黑龙江省在报告员工作上，已取得以下三点经验：第一、报告员经党委审查批准后，必须随之作好一系列的组织工作；严密分工，确定报告对象，制订宣传计划，规定工作制度，这样才能有效地发挥每个报告员的作用。否则会使报告员工作流于形式主义。第二、各级报告员应不断地了解群众干部的思想情况，并根据这些思想情况，准备报告内容，这样才能使自己的报告生动有效。如黑龙江省委组织部郑学孔部长，在向工友作反对美帝国主义武装日本的报告之前，先召集十五个工厂的支部书记、支部委员进行座谈，了解工友思想情况，然后针对这些思想情况进行报告，收效很大。第三、报告员的报告内容，应与宣传员的宣传任务一致。报告员报告后，党的组织即可组织宣传员进行讨论学习，然后向群众去宣传。经验证明，这种结合，在宣传上收的效果特别大。但也要防止宣传员向群众背诵报告员报告的偏向。
