　　The Farmers' Associations in Zhongxiachang and other places in Xupu County Should Not Collect Shed Rent from Vendors
To the Editor:
    Markets (called "chang" in Hunan) are set up in Zhongxiachang, Qiaokou, and Huaqiao in Xupu County, Hunan. Vendors who go to the market have already paid rent of one to two *sheng* of rice to the shed owners for the rented wooden sheds. However, the local Farmers' Associations also collect one *sheng* of rice from each shed, and the vendors, due to their small capital and meager profits, are unwilling to pay this money. It is said that the Farmers' Association has sent militiamen to arrest people several times because of this, but later changed to having the shed owners collect the rent on their behalf. Many vendors are unwilling to go to the market to do business because the shed rent is too high and they cannot afford it. This affects the exchange of goods. I believe that the vendors have already borne the taxes and rent they should pay, and it is unreasonable for the Farmers' Associations to demand another sum of money from them. I hope that the local People's Government and relevant departments will correct this phenomenon.

### 溆浦县仲夏场等地农会不应向商贩征收棚租

专栏：来信摘要

　　溆浦县仲夏场等地农会不应向商贩征收棚租编辑同志：
    湖南溆浦县仲夏场、桥口、花桥等处设有集市（湖南称为场）。赶场的商贩所租木棚，已向棚主缴纳租金一至二升米。但当地农会却又要向每个棚子征收一升米，商贩们因本小利微，都不愿出这笔钱。据说有几次农会因此派民兵抓人，后来则改由棚主代收。不少商贩因棚租过高，负担不起，而不愿意到集上去做生意了。这就使物资交流受到影响。我认为商贩们已负担了应纳捐税和租金，农会向他们再索取一份钱，是不合理的。我希望当地人民政府与有关部门纠正这种现象。
