Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 10th. French troops invading Vietnam and puppet troops of the Bao Dai puppet government have repeatedly invaded our territory and opened fire on our troops, interfering with our army's剿匪 operations within our own borders. The invading actions of the French troops and Bao Dai puppet troops have aroused great anger among our border army and civilians.

On March 2nd, French officials Guo Shi, a five-circle commander, Liu Pai, a three-circle commander, Bao Dai puppet troops Gu Yi, Xue Guoding, Gu Liuzhou official, Zou Lan (Vietnamese), head of the Meng Suo militia regiment, and a French journalist, carrying cameras, telescopes and other items, illegally entered Jinshuihe Town, Jinping County, Yunnan Province, to meet with local bandit Diao Jiazhu, and did not leave our territory until the afternoon of the same day. There is no doubt that they were supporting the bandits to expand the rebellion. When our army advanced to suppress the bandits, the French troops on the opposite bank fired at us with machine guns and rifles to assist the bandits in their stubborn resistance.

On the 4th, our剿匪 troops in Jinping County were attacked by local French troops stationed in Manniangong, Vietnam (opposite Nafa Xun, southwest of Jinping County). On the 8th, French troops and Bao Dai puppet troops continued to assist the bandits in Jinping County in their stubborn resistance. Our剿匪 troops and local militia, in order to safeguard national interests and self-defense, fought back. In the counterattack, our army captured French platoon-level officer Buse, Bao Dai puppet army translator and squad leader Diao Jinbiao, squad leader Leng Wanlei, and 23 Vietnamese soldiers, and seized one machine gun, two submachine guns, one carbine, 18 rifles, and a quantity of bullets and grenades.

Prior to this, French troops and Bao Dai puppet troops invading Vietnam had repeatedly provoked us and supported bandits within our borders in carrying out rebellions. On October 24 last year, Diao Wen'an, the Meng Suo provincial governor of the Bao Dai puppet regime, illegally entered Mengla area, Jinping County, to meet with bandit leader Diao Jiazhu, and frequently supplied Diao Jiazhu, He Guangrong and other bandit units with military supplies.

Also, on January 6th and 8th, French aircraft twice violated our airspace. On the 8th at 16:00, three French aircraft invaded our airspace over Jinshuihe and Zhongrong areas of Jinping County, circling for as long as one hour. One of them strafed Baishiyan Village.

Recently, the French troops and Bao Dai puppet troops have not only not stopped their provocative acts of infringing upon our land and air sovereignty, but also increased their forces in Manniangong on March 10, claiming that if our country does not release the French officer Buse and others who were captured during the provocative actions, they will launch an attack on us. Our border army and civilians are closely watching this new unreasonable provocative behavior of France.

　　侵略越南的法军与保大傀儡军
　　接连侵入我国境向我军开枪射击
　　在金平干扰我军剿匪行动被我俘获官兵二十余人
　　我边疆军民正密切注视其新的无理挑衅行为
    【新华社昆明十日电】侵略越南的法国军队与保大傀儡政府伪军，接连侵入我国领土，并向我国军队开枪射击，干扰我军在本国境内的剿匪行动。法军和保大傀儡军的侵犯行为已引起我边疆军民的极大愤怒。
    三月二日，越南莱州、猛梭（莱州东北）、三乐民兵总指挥法国五圈官果实、三圈官刘拍、保大伪军谷抑、古柳州官薛国丁、猛梭民兵团长邹兰（越人）及法记者一人，携带照像机、望远镜等物，擅自进入我国云南之金平县金水河镇，与当地土匪刁家柱会谈，直至当日下午始离我国境，其为支助土匪扩大叛乱，已无可置疑。当我军向该部土匪进剿时，对岸法军曾以机枪、步枪向我射击，协助土匪进行顽抗。
    四日，我金平县剿匪部队曾受到驻在越南曼念贡（金平县城西南那发讯对面）地方法军的袭击。八日，法军及保大伪军又继续援助我国金平县境内土匪进行顽抗。我剿匪部队与当地民兵为维护国家权益和自卫，予以反击。在反击中，我军俘获法国排级军官布色、保大伪军翻译兼班长刁金彪、班长冷万儡及越籍士兵共二十三人，缴获机枪一挺、手提式二支、卡宾枪一支、步枪十八支及子弹、手榴弹各一部。
    在此以前，侵犯越南的法国军队及保大伪军，曾多次向我国挑衅，支助我国境内土匪进行叛乱。去年十月二十四日，保大伪政权猛梭省长刁文安，曾擅自进入我金平县猛喇地方，与匪首刁家柱会晤，并经常以军火供应刁家柱、贺光荣等匪部。
    又一月六日、八日，法国飞机曾两度侵犯我领空，其中八日十六时侵入我国金平县金水河、忠嵘一带领空的法机三架，曾盘旋达一小时之久。其中一架并向我白石岩村扫射。
    最近，法军及保大伪军不仅没有中止侵犯我国陆空主权的挑衅行为，而且于三月十日在曼念贡增加兵力，扬言如我国不释放其在挑衅行动中被俘虏之法军官布色等，即将向我发动进攻。我边境军民，对法国此种新的无理挑衅行为，正加以密切注意。
