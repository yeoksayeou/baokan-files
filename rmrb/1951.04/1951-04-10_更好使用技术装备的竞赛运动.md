Better Use of Technical Equipment in Competitive Sports

    Currently, a nationwide competition for better use of technical equipment is underway in the Soviet Union. This movement began in January and February of this year in anticipation of the elections of the Supreme Soviets of the various Union Republics, and is now being promoted in industry and agriculture. Metallurgical and machine-building workers in Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, and the Urals, coal miners in Kuzbass and Donbass, oil workers in Baku, construction workers on the Volga-Don Canal, lumber workers in Karelia-Finland and Siberia, textile workers in Moscow and Ivanovo, tractor drivers in Kuban and Kazakhstan, and numerous other machine workers in heavy industry, light industry, transportation, and agriculture are all participating in this competition with a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm.
    This patriotic and selfless labor enthusiasm of the Soviet working people stems from the noble ideals of striving for social happiness and national prosperity, as well as from the recognition of the competition for better use of technical equipment. Soviet industry and agriculture, by their socialist nature, are the most advanced in the world, and their technical equipment is also the most advanced. The victorious completion of the First Five-Year Plan after the war has greatly renewed the technical equipment of many sectors of the national economy, significantly increasing their level of mechanization. The output of the machine-building industry reached 2.2 times the pre-war level. More than 700 highly efficient new machines were manufactured in 1949 and 1950 alone. Laborious work in many industrial sectors such as coal mining, metallurgy, construction, and lumber has been mechanized. Take the coal mining industry as an example: as early as 1949, 98.1 percent of mining operations, 99 percent of transport operations, and 98.6 percent of loading and unloading operations had been mechanized. A combined machine called "Donbass" is now in use, with one machine able to replace the laborious work of dozens of people, simultaneously excavating coal and unloading it onto conveyor belts. Take agriculture as an example: collective farms and state farms have increased their stock by 330,000 tractors, 75,000 combine harvesters, 146,000 trucks, and 3.3 million other agricultural machines in the last two years alone. It is not difficult to imagine how significant it is for the development of socialist production to use and utilize the strength of such a strong new technical equipment well. For example, due to the use of high-speed cutting methods on cutting machines, the workload of all Soviet machine-building factories increased by a factor of two in 1950 compared to 1949. The competition for better use of technical equipment is being carried out on such a superior foundation.
    To make better use of technical equipment means to master one's machines perfectly, to maximize the potential of the machines to increase production. The scope of this competition is very broad, including protecting machines, improving technology, and even organizing labor.
    Here is an example: Recently, 1,400 miners from the "Rostov Coal Mine" in Shakhty, Donbass coal region, participated in a competition initiated by Mokilenko, a coal cutting machine operator from Anthracite Pit No. 46. This competition, centered on implementing machine responsibility systems and fully utilizing machine functions, is expanding. During the thirteen months from January of last year to February of this year, the coal cutting machine used by Mokilenko has not been overhauled (the original usage period was eight months, and he guaranteed one year of use). Due to responsible protection and good use of the machine, his monthly coal production in the first few months was about 3,000 tons, increasing to 5,000 tons in November of last year, and 6,000 tons in December, while the original standard was only 2,700 tons. Last year, he completed 27 months of production tasks. He is also competing with excavator operators on the Volga-Don Canal. Before going to work, Mokilenko always checks his machine, runs it idle once, observes any problems, oils the places that need oiling, and replaces broken gear teeth to avoid wasting motor power; after work, he wipes the machine clean, oils it, and then reports the machine's condition to the team leader. In addition, he writes down the machine's condition in a special notebook and helps others master the machine. He personally participates in machine repairs whenever they are needed. He pays great attention to improving his technical knowledge and recently graduated from the technical training class attached to the mine. He is very concerned about reading relevant newspapers and magazines. His mine holds a "Coal Cutting Machine Operator Day" every month to exchange experiences.
    Another example: the Buneev Tractor Team of the Malorussisk Machine Tractor Station in Kuban initiated a competition to cultivate more land with existing tractors. Now, thousands of tractor drivers in Kazakhstan alone are learning from their example. Buneev is a hero of socialist labor and a tractor team leader. His team implemented economic accounting last year, with each tractor driver having a ledger to record fuel and repair material consumption; last year, individual personnel implemented responsible protection systems for tractors, reducing consumption and lowering tractor operating costs. In February of this year, after conducting research with the tractor drivers in his team, and with the help of agricultural experts, Buneev formulated correct routes and time calculations for completing each shift's work tasks for each team member, and carried out early repairs to tractors and farm implements in preparation for spring plowing. The team challenged tractor drivers in the entire Krasnodar region: to harvest more than 150 poods per hectare of winter wheat (equivalent to more than 320 catties per mu), and more than 120 poods per hectare of sunflowers from all cultivated land. Each tractor must cultivate 1,100 hectares of land and will not be overhauled until it has cultivated 500 to 700 hectares; use the fuel saved to cultivate one day every eleven days; each tractor must work two shifts and exceed the plan, with good work quality; the cost per hectare of tractor work must be reduced by two rubles, and 20 percent of repair materials must be saved; all tractors and their attached farm implements will implement responsible protection systems. In this way, the competition for better use of technical equipment is closely combined with the competition for increasing productivity, improving work quality, saving materials, and reducing costs.
  (II)
    In the competition for better use of technical equipment, grassroots trade union workers have played a significant role. The situation at the Moscow Press Machine Factory is a case in point.
    The Moscow Press Machine Factory is a factory that is good at utilizing its production potential. It has increased its output by 4.8 times in the past five years and completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in February of last year. When planning how to exceed last year's output this year, the factory leaders felt that it would seem impossible to do so without greatly increasing the number of machines. However, the competition initiated by Potapov, the cutting worker and trade union group leader in the mechanical workshop, and his achievements proved that it was possible.
    In anticipation of the elections of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federal Republic, the second group in the mechanical workshop, according to Potapov's proposal, decided: to increase output by more than 10 percent with existing manpower and machines, to completely eliminate the loss of non-productive working time in the first half of the year, and to increase the efficiency of machines by 10 to 15 percent. The workshop administration immediately supported this. Engineers and statisticians, together with foremen and workers, calculated the highest load rate for each machine. After calculation, it was known that production could be greatly increased if the loss of non-productive working time, such as modifying the machine, was eliminated. Encouraged by Potapov, the workers actively adopted a machine-specific responsibility system. Before the machines were handed over to workers for responsible use, they were inspected and repaired. In order to keep the machines running continuously, machine maintenance was carried out on rest days or non-working days.
    After the competition began, the workers demanded to see their own and everyone else's achievements every day. Therefore, in addition to assigning specific tasks before going to work, guiding production during work, and checking the quality of finished products, the foreman, with the assistance of the statistician, also summarized the overall and individual work achievements every day and handed them over to Potapov, the trade union group leader, for publication. During the lunch break every day, Potapov usually convened a trade union group meeting for a few minutes, at which he briefly informed everyone how the tasks were completed last night and by whom, and then posted the figures on the bulletin board. Previously, the results of the competition were announced in the workshop twice a month, but now they are announced in the production group every day. This greatly improved the morale of the workers. Previously, because there were many people in the workshop, the achievements were not noticeable; when the results were announced late, the experience could not be quickly disseminated. Now the opposite is true. At the same time, the trade union group also issued "express reports." Those who exceeded the tasks first were those who eliminated the loss of non-productive time. Previously, workers had to spend twenty or thirty minutes after going to work cleaning up their work positions and receiving materials. In the competition, as a result of discussions between Potapov and the foreman, it was decided that the previous shift of workers should clean up their work positions before going off duty, and ensure that the next shift of workers could work continuously for two hours after taking over.
    Potapov, the trade union group leader, paid great attention to the workers' education. He often talked with the workers about the communist attitude they should have towards labor and socialist property. He also often provided the workers with suggestions on how to better manufacture certain parts. Three "Stakhanov learning classes" were established in the production group to impart experience on the spot. One class was taught by him personally. Potapov knew that the task of the trade union group leader was to help the foreman arrange and guide the production of the entire group, so he maintained close contact with the foreman and often discussed production issues. He often reflected the workers' demands to the foreman on behalf of the workers, and pointed out shortcomings in the work, while the foreman humbly accepted his opinions and better organized production. Realistic criticism improved the creativity and enthusiasm of all members of the group.
    Potapov's production group's competition for better use of technical equipment was valued by the factory leadership. The factory trade union committee drafted a plan to launch the competition, and decided to first hold meetings of various trade union groups, because at such meetings workers could make more criticisms and suggestions. Of the 1,100 people who attended the meeting, 450 spoke. The factory director instructed the workshop director to provide all possible conveniences to the competitors. In this way, 60 trade union groups in the press machine factory, including more than 1,000 trade union members, participated in the competition. Before March 1, more than 80 percent of the factory's machine equipment, including cranes and handcarts, had implemented a machine-specific responsibility system. The machines were repaired before they were handed over to the workers for responsible use. Many production groups also inspected the machines once a week. The groups participating in the competition all learned from Potapov's group's daily announcement of results, promoted the experience of advanced workers, and strengthened the connection between the trade union group leader and the foreman. In order to promote the connection between the two, the factory's Party, trade union, and Youth League organizations regularly held "Foreman and Trade Union Group Leader Days." Foreman and Trade Union Group Leader Days either discussed the workers' rationalization proposals or discussed the results and experiences of the competition. The competition also found that only by strictly organizing the trade union group according to production principles could the close connection between the trade union group leader and the foreman be guaranteed. Previously, some classes had three or four trade union groups, and some trade union groups included two or three production groups. These shortcomings have been corrected.
    The results of the first month of the competition in the press machine factory were considerable. The output of each machine in Potapov's production group increased by 10.3 percent in February.
    In this way, the competition for better use of technical equipment was promoted from one production group to the entire factory, from one factory to the entire enterprise department, creating a huge movement on a national scale.

　　更好使用技术装备的竞赛运动
　　李何
  （一）
    目前苏联全国正展开更好使用技术装备的竞赛运动。这个运动开始于今年一、二月间迎接各加盟共和国最高苏维埃选举的时候，现在正在工业和农业中推广着。莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯大林格勒和乌拉尔的冶金和机器制造工人，库兹巴斯和顿巴斯的采煤工人、巴库的石油工人、伏尔加河——顿河运河的建筑工人、卡累利阿——芬兰和西伯利亚的木材工人、莫斯科和伊凡诺伏的纺织工人、库班和哈萨克的拖拉机手，以及许许多多的重工业、轻工业、运输业和农业机器工人，都怀着高度的爱国主义热情投入这一竞赛运动中去。
    苏联劳动人民的这种爱国主义的忘我劳动热情，出于为社会幸福和为祖国繁荣而奋斗的崇高理想，也出于对更好使用技术装备的竞赛运动的认识。苏联的工业和农业，就其社会主义性质来说是世界上最先进的，就其技术装备来说也是世界上最先进的。战后第一届五年计划的胜利完成，使国民经济许多部门的技术装备焕然一新，大大提高了它们的机械化水平。机器制造业的产量达到战前水平的二点二倍。仅在一九四九年和一九五零年间就制造了七百多种效率极高的新式机器。像采煤、冶金、建筑、木材等许多工业部门的费力的劳动都机械化了。拿采煤工业来说：还在一九四九年，采掘工作的百分之九十八点一、输送工作的百分之九十九和装卸工作的百分之九十八点六已机械化了。现在使用的一种叫做“顿巴斯”的联合机，一台机器就能代替几十个人的费力劳动，它能在挖煤同时把煤卸在运送带上。拿农业来说：集体农场和国家农场仅在最近两年中，就增加了拖拉机三十三万辆、康拜因机七万五千辆、载重汽车十四万六千辆、其他农业机器三百三十万架。不难想像，很好地使用和发挥这样雄厚的新式技术装备的力量，对于发展社会主义生产有多么重大的意义。例如：全苏机器制造厂由于运用快速切割法的切割母机，就使一九五零年工作量比一九四九年增加了一倍。更好使用技术装备的竞赛运动，就是在这样优越的基础上进行的。
    更好地使用技术装备，这就是说，要完善地掌握自己的机器，尽量发挥机器的潜在能力，以提高生产。这一竞赛运动的范围很广，它包括保护机器、改进技术以至于组织劳动。
    这里有一个例子：最近顿巴斯煤区沙赫特城“罗斯多夫煤矿场”有一千四百个矿工，参加了第四十六号无烟煤坑挖煤机手摩基连科发起的竞赛。这个以实行机器负责制和充分发挥机器功能为中心的竞赛运动正在扩大着。从去年一月到今年二月的十三个月间，摩基连科使用的挖煤机就没有检修过（原定使用期限为八个月，他保证使用一年）。由于负责保护和很好使用机器，他在头几个月内每月产煤约三千吨，去年十一月增到五千吨，十二月增到六千吨，而原定标准不过二千七百吨。去年他完成了二十七个月的生产任务。他还和伏尔加河——顿河运河的挖土机手进行竞赛。摩基连科在上班之前总要检查一遍自己的机器，把它空转一回，察看有什么毛病，该上油的地方就上油，折了的轮齿就换掉，免得耗费摩托力；下班后他把机器擦干净，上油，然后向组长报告机器情况。此外，他还把机器的情形写在特备的簿子上，并且帮助别人掌握机器。遇到修理机器，他都亲自参加。他非常注意提高自己的技术知识，不久前才从矿内附设的技术训练班毕业。他很关心阅读有关的报纸刊物。他那个矿场上每月都举行一次“挖煤机手日”，交换经验。
    另外一个例子：库班马洛露西斯克机器拖拉机站布涅夫拖拉机队，发起了用现有拖拉机耕种更多土地的竞赛。现在仅哈萨克一个共和国就有几千名拖拉机手学习他们的榜样。布涅夫是社会主义劳动英雄和拖拉机队长。他所领导的一队去年已实行经济核算制，每个拖拉机手有一本账簿，登记燃料和修理材料消耗的情形；去年个别人员已实行了对拖拉机的负责保护制，减少了消耗，减低了拖拉机工作成本。今年二月间布涅夫和本队拖拉机手作了一番研究之后，在农业专家的帮助下，为每个队员制订了正确路线和完成每班工作任务的时间计算表，先期修理了拖拉机和农具，以准备春耕。该队向克拉斯诺达全区拖拉机手挑战：要从所有耕地上每公顷收冬麦一百五十普特以上（合每市亩三百二十市斤以上），向日葵一百二十普特以上。每辆拖拉机要耕一千一百公顷土地，不耕到五百至七百公顷不用检修；每十一天用节省下的燃料耕作一天；每架拖拉机做两班工作，而且要超过计划，工作质量要好；拖拉机每公顷工作成本要减低两卢布，要节约修理材料百分之二十；所有拖拉机及其附带农具都实行负责保护制。这样，更好使用技术装备的竞赛，便跟提高生产率、提高工作质量、节约材料、减低成本的竞赛紧密结合起来了。
  （二）
    在更好使用技术装备的竞赛运动中，工会基层工作者起了很大的作用。莫斯科压榨机制造厂的情形便是如此。
    莫斯科压榨机制造厂是善于发挥生产潜力的工厂。它在过去五年中增加了产量四点八倍，并在去年二月提前完成了五年计划。在今年开始筹划如何超过去年的产量时，厂内的领导人觉得不大大增加机器，这似乎是不可能做到的。然而机械车间工会小组长切割工人波塔波夫发起的竞赛及其成就却证明这是可能做到的。
    在迎接俄罗斯联邦共和国最高苏维埃选举的时候，根据波塔波夫的提议，机械车间第二组决定：要用现有的人力和机器提高产量百分之十以上，上半年要完全消灭非生产的工作时间的损失，要提高机器的效率百分之十到十五。车间行政上立刻予以支持。工程师和统计员跟领班和工人们一起，计算了每台母机最高的负荷率。计算之后知道如果消灭了像改装母机等非生产的工作时间的损失，生产量是可以大大提高的。在波塔波夫的鼓励下，工人们积极采取了机器专人负责制。机器在点交工人负责使用前，都经过检查和修理。为了使机器不断工作，检修机器放在休息日或非工作日进行。
    竞赛开始后，工人们要求每天都看到自己的和大家的成绩。因此领班除了上班前分配具体任务，在工作中指导生产和检查成品质量之外，还在统计员协助下总结每天全体和每人的工作成绩，交给工会小组长波塔波夫公布。每天午饭休息的时候，波塔波夫通常要召集工会小组开几分钟会，会上他简要地通知昨晚全体和每人是怎样完成任务的，然后在公告牌上公布数字。以前竞赛结果每月在车间公布两次，现在每天在生产组公布。这样就大大提高了工人的情绪。以前因为车间人多，成绩便显不出；成绩公布得迟，经验便不能迅速传播。现在相反了。同时，工会小组还发出了“快报”。首先超出任务的，是那些消灭了非生产时间的损失的人们。以前工人上班后，要花二、三十分钟去收拾工作位置和领取材料。在竞赛中，波塔波夫和领班商量的结果，决定前一班工人在下班之前，要把工作位置收拾干净，要保证下一班工人接手后两个钟头之内能不断工作。
    工会小组长波塔波夫非常注意工人的教育工作。他经常和工人们交谈对劳动和对社会主义财产应有的共产主义态度。他也经常向工人们提供如何更好地制造某些零件的意见。生产组内成立了三班就地传授经验的“斯塔哈诺夫学习班”。有一班由他亲自教授。波塔波夫知道工会小组长的任务是帮助领班来布置和指导全组的生产，因此他和领班保持着密切的接触，经常商量生产上的问题。他经常代表工人向领班反映工人的要求，提出工作中的缺点，而领班则虚心地接受他的意见，更好地组织生产。实事求是的批评提高了全组人员的创造性和积极性。
    波塔波夫生产组更好使用技术装备的竞赛，受到了该厂领导上的重视。工厂工会委员会拟定了展开竞赛的计划，决定首先举行各工会小组会议，因为在这种会议上工人能够更多地提出批评和建议。在参加这次会议的一千一百人中，有四百五十人说了话。厂长指示车间长要给竞赛者以一切方便条件。这样，压榨机制造厂六十个工会小组，包括一千多工会会员，都参加了竞赛。三月一日以前，全厂百分之八十以上的机器装备，包括起重机、手车在内，都实行了专人负责制。机器点交工人负责使用之前都修理妥当。许多生产组还每周检查一次机器。参加竞赛的组都学习波塔波夫组每日公布成绩，推广先进者的经验，密切工会小组长和领班的联系。为了促进两者之间的联系，工厂的党、工会和青年团的组织都定期举行“领班和工会小组长日”。领班和工会小组长日不是讨论工人的合理化建议就是讨论竞赛的结果和经验。在竞赛中还发现了只有严格按照生产原则来组织工会小组，才能保证工会小组长和领班的密切联系。以前有的一班有三四个工会小组，有的一个工会小组包括两三个生产组，这些缺点都被纠正过来了。
    压榨机制造厂第一个月的竞赛，成绩很可观。波塔波夫的生产组每一台母机的产量在二月份增加了百分之十点三。
    更好使用技术装备的竞赛，就是这样从一个生产组推广到整个工厂，由一个工厂推广到整个企业部门，而造成了全国规模的巨大运动。
