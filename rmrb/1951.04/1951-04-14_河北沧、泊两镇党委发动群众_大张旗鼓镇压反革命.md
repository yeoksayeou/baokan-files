The Cang and Bo Towns' Party Committees in Hebei Province Mobilize the Masses to Vigorously Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries

In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the CPC committees of Cang and Bo Towns in Hebei Province earnestly mobilized the broad masses, achieving a vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The main experience driving this movement forward rapidly was the extensive and thorough propaganda and mobilization work.

Eliminating counter-revolutionaries is a serious and acute political struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. Therefore, it is necessary to first overcome the right-leaning and paralyzing thoughts of revolutionary cadres and clarify the revolutionary stance. This is an important link in correctly implementing policies and deeply mobilizing the broad masses of people to wage a resolute struggle against counter-revolutionaries. Initially, some Communist Party members and cadres in these two towns had serious right-leaning and paralyzing thoughts. Some people were not active in this work, or were hesitant and afraid to mobilize the masses, fearing mistakes; individual elements with wavering stances even accepted bribes from counter-revolutionary elements, sheltering and letting go of counter-revolutionary elements. All of this seriously hindered the development of this movement. The Cang and Bo Towns' CPC committees and people's governments first convened meetings of organ cadres, party members, and cadres, party members, and members of the Youth League in streets and factories to conduct in-depth ideological education on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The meetings combined the communication and implementation of the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries, inspiring cadres, party members, and members of the Youth League to recall and denounce the crimes of counter-revolutionaries, arousing everyone's hatred for counter-revolutionary elements and enhancing their political awareness. In this way, the broad cadres, party members, and Youth League members became the backbone of this movement. They went out to convene mass meetings, small group meetings, and symposiums, combining the denunciation of counter-revolutionary crimes to carry out propaganda and education on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. They also actively mobilized the broad masses of people to report and accuse counter-revolutionary elements to the government, help the government monitor, arrest, and control counter-revolutionary criminals, and investigate and study the activities of reactionary elements. More than 300 party members of the Cang Town street branch secretly reported and accused counter-revolutionary elements to the government. Cadres and party members of Sihe Street helped the government arrest the extremely vicious leader of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit assassination gang. With the active assistance of cadres, party members, and the broad masses of people, the town's public security organs arrested a large number of counter-revolutionary criminals.

The party committees of these two towns used the party's propaganda network in this movement. They led reporters and propagandists to conduct widespread propaganda and mobilization work for suppressing counter-revolutionaries among the people. At the beginning of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the party committee convened a meeting of propagandists, with the secretary of the party committee personally making a report on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The 222 propagandists in the two towns were very active in this movement. They held casual talks from door to door, convened mass symposiums, and carried out propaganda at various meetings and at execution grounds. Propagandists from Bo Town Normal School went deep into the streets to conduct propaganda until 12 o'clock at night. Factory propagandists went deep into the workshops in conjunction with production to carry out propaganda. The propagandists also paid attention to collecting mass feedback, understanding the people's ideological situation, studying it, and reporting it to the higher levels. The reporters were also very active in the movement. Fifteen reporters in Cang Town made twenty-eight reports to the masses on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in half a month, with nearly 10,000 listeners. From February 15th to March 17th, the secretary of the Bo Town party committee made nineteen reports on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the mayor made twelve reports in twenty days. The results were all very significant.

The party committees and people's governments of the two towns also organized cadres to go deep into the streets, factories, and industries to convene workers', citizens', and merchants' meetings, small group meetings, and symposiums to conduct ideological education on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. This dispelled some of the masses' muddled ideas and concerns about the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and combined with denouncing, accusing, and exposing the crimes of counter-revolutionaries, enlightened the people's political awareness and mobilized the masses to actively participate in this movement. Cang Town organized more than 20 cadres, in addition to convening various mass meetings and small group meetings for propaganda, also convened symposiums of ten types of people: industry and commerce, Hui people, doctors, art and literature, teachers, youth, women, students, and peasants. In conjunction with the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea, a ten-day propaganda movement against American imperialism's arming of Japan was carried out in the industrial and commercial sectors. Bo Town also organized a propaganda team of more than 50 cadres and students to carry out five days of extensive propaganda. During the propaganda, the general public's emotions were extremely high, actively supporting the measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries, rejoicing, and spreading the news. However, a few of the masses still had some concerns. Some were afraid that the government would be too lenient, some were afraid of implicating themselves, some were afraid of false accusations by bad people, and some were afraid that the government would not handle the matter carefully and let counter-revolutionary elements escape. After the party committee discovered this, it focused on publicizing the people's government's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in light of these ideological situations. At the same time, it mobilized the broad masses of people to recall and denounce the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements. At the cadres' meeting of the Bo Town Federation of Trade Unions, everyone was encouraged to express their grievances, and one after another spoke of the suffering they had suffered at the hands of counter-revolutionary elements. When a worker talked about the shameless crime of special agents stripping a woman naked and playing with her on the street, everyone's emotions were extremely indignant, and they unanimously stated that they would resolutely assist the government in eliminating counter-revolutionaries. The deputy manager of Cang Town Chunhe Public Goods Store was detained by special agents when he bought fur goods during the Japanese rule and spent a lot of money to redeem them. Later, for his own safety, he gave gifts and treated special agents and traitors to dinner. At the beginning of this movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, because he did not understand the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, he was panicked that someone would say that he had contact with special agents. After propaganda and education, he understood that suppressing counter-revolutionaries was to avenge himself. He boldly denounced the special agents at the merchants' symposium. Under his influence and the education of the government, the merchants reported seven hidden counter-revolutionary elements to the government.

When arresting and executing counter-revolutionary elements, both towns held grand mass denunciation meetings and public trial meetings, everywhere explaining policies, exposing the crimes of arrested and executed counter-revolutionary elements. This transformed some of the masses' pity for counter-revolutionary elements and greatly enhanced the political awareness and vigilance of the people. The broad masses of people actively reported and accused counter-revolutionary elements to the people's government. Cang Town alone reported more than 300 counter-revolutionary criminals.

Another important method of relying on and mobilizing the masses to do a good job in suppressing counter-revolutionaries is to implement policies, listen to the voices and demands of people from all walks of life, and carry out propaganda and education to the broad masses of people through the people's representatives of all walks of life through the convening of people's representative conferences and consultative committees. Before executing counter-revolutionary criminals, Cang and Bo Towns convened expanded meetings of the people's representative conferences and consultative committees, in which, in addition to the participation of consultative committee members, people's representatives from all walks of life and other representative figures were also invited to participate in discussing the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries and the handling of counter-revolutionary criminals. This not only enhanced the political awareness of the people's representatives from all walks of life, but also fully promoted democracy, enabling the people's government to correctly sentence criminals in accordance with policies and the demands of the masses. Representatives from all walks of life were very satisfied with the government's attitude of relying on the broad masses of people to cautiously handle problems.

In carrying out propaganda for the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the propagandists were also able to use various forms of propaganda, such as art and literature, rooftop broadcasts, blackboard newspapers, propaganda products, and street speeches, to carry out extensive propaganda. Bo Town used slide shows to show "Shangrao Concentration Camp," the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries," and the crimes of executed counter-revolutionary elements. It also mobilized amateur theater troupes to rehearse various dramas on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, exposing the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements with true people and events, which greatly educated the masses. Bo Town Normal School drew thirty cartoons on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and posted them on the streets, and people went to see them every day. The masses reflected: "Counter-revolutionary elements are really hateful. We shouldn't be polite to these bad guys." Citizen Jiang Yuyuan saw the propaganda products of the execution of counter-revolutionary criminal Du Songlin and happily shouted: "The government is really eliminating harm for the people. When Du the blind man was a special agent, he arrested me and beat me to death. Now the government has executed him. This time I can finally vent my anger. It's really a good government!"

Cang and Bo Towns, due to relying on and mobilizing the strength of the broad masses, carried out the propaganda for the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in a vigorous manner. Therefore, their work has achieved great results. In these two towns, a vigorous movement to eliminate counter-revolutionaries with leadership, planning, order, and the participation of the broad masses of people has already formed. At present, this movement is developing extensively and deeply. However, the Bo Town Party Committee did not pay attention to closely integrating the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries with the movement to resist America and aid Korea and oppose American imperialism's rearmament of Japan, which should be corrected in subsequent movements.

　　河北沧、泊两镇党委发动群众
    大张旗鼓镇压反革命
    中共河北沧县地委书记  甘春雷  宣传部长  赵萍
    在镇压反革命运动中，河北沧镇、泊镇的中共党委认真地发动了广大群众，作到了大张旗鼓地镇压反革命。推动这个运动迅速向前发展的主要经验是进行了普遍深入的宣传鼓动工作。
    肃清反革命，就是革命与反革命的严重尖锐的政治斗争，因此，必须首先克服革命干部的右倾、麻痹思想，明确革命立场。这是正确贯彻政策、深入发动广大人民群众向反革命进行坚决斗争的重要环节。开始，这两镇的部分共产党员和干部，存有严重的右倾、麻痹思想。有些人对这一工作不积极，或束手束脚，不敢发动群众，怕出错误；个别立场不坚定的分子，甚至受反革命分子的贿赂，包庇、放走反革命分子。这些都严重障碍了这一运动的开展。沧镇、泊镇中共党委和人民政府，首先召开了机关干部、党员会议和街道、工厂的干部、党员、团员会议，进行了深入的镇压反革命的思想教育。会议结合传达与贯彻惩治反革命条例，启发干部、党员、团员回忆、控诉反革命的罪行，激发了大家对反革命分子的仇恨，提高了政治觉悟。这样，广大的干部、党员、团员，就成为这一运动的骨干。他们四出召开群众大会、片会、座谈会，结合控诉反革命罪行，进行关于镇压反革命的宣传教育。并积极地发动广大人民群众，向政府检举、控告反革命分子，帮助政府监视、逮捕、管制反革命罪犯；调查、研究反动分子的活动情况。沧镇街道支部党员，就有三百多人向政府密报、检举反革命分子。四合街干部、党员帮助政府逮捕了罪大恶极的蒋匪暗杀团小队长。在干部、党员和广大人民群众的积极协助之下，该镇公安机关逮捕了大批反革命罪犯。
    这两个镇的党委在这一运动中，运用了党的宣传网。他们领导报告员、宣传员在人民群众中，普遍进行镇压反革命宣传鼓动工作。镇压反革命开始，党委曾召开了宣传员大会，由党委书记亲自作镇压反革命的报告。两个镇二百二十二个宣传员，在这一运动中非常活跃。他们挨户漫谈，召开群众座谈会，并在各种会议上和刑场上进行宣传。泊镇师范学生宣传员，深入到街道去一直宣传到晚十二时。工厂宣传员结合生产深入到车间进行宣传。宣传员并注意了搜集群众反映，了解群众思想情况，加以研究，向上汇报。报告员在运动中也非常活跃。沧镇十五名报告员半月向群众作了二十八次有关镇压反革命的报告，听众近万人。泊镇党委书记从二月十五日至三月十七日，作了十九次镇压反革命报告，镇长二十天作了十二次报告。效果都很大。
    两镇的党委和人民政府，又组织干部深入到街道、工厂、行业召开工人、市民、商人大会、片会和座谈会，进行镇压反革命的思想教育。这样解除了某些群众对镇压反革命的糊涂观念和顾虑，并且结合控诉、控告、揭露反革命罪行，启发人民的政治觉悟，发动人民群众积极投入到这个运动中来。沧镇组织了二十多个干部，除召开各种群众大会、片会宣传外，还召开了工商、回民、医生、文艺、教职员、青年、妇女、学生、农民等十一种座谈会。并结合抗美援朝的爱国运动，在工商业界开展了十天反对美帝国主义武装日本的宣传运动。泊镇也组织了干部、学生五十多人的宣传队，进行了五天的广泛宣传。在宣传中，一般群众情绪极为高涨，对镇压反革命的措施积极拥护，欢天喜地，奔走相告。但也有少数群众仍存在一些顾虑。有的怕政府再宽大无边，有的怕连累自己，有的怕坏人诬告，有的怕政府处理不慎放跑了反革命分子。党委发现后，又针对这些思想情况，着重宣传了人民政府镇压反革命政策。同时发动了广大人民回忆、控诉反革命分子罪行。泊镇工会在工会干部会议上，启发大家诉苦，一个接一个地说出了自己遭受反革命分子摧残的苦处。当一个工人说到特务把一个妇女剥去衣服裸体在街上玩弄的无耻罪行时，大家的情绪异常激怒，一致表示，坚决协助政府肃清反革命。沧镇春和公货栈副经理，在日本统治时，因买皮货遭到特务扣押，花了很多钱才赎出来。后来他为了自己的安全，曾给特务、汉奸送礼、请客。在这次镇压反革命运动开始时因为他对镇压反革命政策不了解，怕有人说这是自己与特务有联系，有些恐慌。经过宣传教育他明白了镇压反革命是为自己报仇。他便在商人座谈会上大胆地控诉了特务。在他的影响和政府的教育下，商人们向政府检举了七个隐蔽的反革命分子。
    在逮捕与处决反革命分子时，两镇都召开了盛大的群众控诉大会、公审大会，到处讲政策，揭露被捕和被处决的反革命分子罪行。这样转变了某些群众对反革命分子的怜悯思想，大大地提高了人民群众的政治觉悟和警惕性。广大群众纷纷自动向人民政府检举、控告反革命分子。仅沧镇就检举了三百多名反革命罪犯。
    依靠群众、发动群众做好镇压反革命工作的另一个重要方法，是通过召开各界人民代表会议协商委员会，贯彻政策，听取各界人民代表的呼声和要求，通过各界人民代表向广大人民进行宣传教育。在处决反革命罪犯之前，沧、泊两镇均召开了各界人民代表会协商委员会扩大会议，除协商委员参加外，还邀请了各界人民代表和其他代表人物参加，讨论惩治反革命条例和处理反革命罪犯问题。这样既提高了各界人民代表的政治觉悟，又充分的发扬了民主，使人民政府能够根据政策和群众要求，正确的量刑。各界代表对政府这样依靠广大人民慎重处理问题的态度，非常满意。
    在进行镇压反革命宣传中，宣传员又能利用各种宣传形式，如文艺、屋顶广播、黑板报、宣传品、街头讲演等，广泛地进行了宣传。泊镇利用幻灯放映了《上饶集中营》、《惩治反革命条例》和被处决的反革命分子罪行。并动员了业余剧团排演各种镇压反革命戏剧，用真人真事揭露反革命分子罪恶，对群众的教育很大。泊镇师范画了三十幅镇压反革命的漫画贴在街上，天天有群众去看。群众反映：“反革命分子真可恨。对这些坏家伙不应客气。”市民姜玉元看到枪决反革命罪犯杜松林的宣传品后，高兴的喊道：“政府真为人民除害，杜瞎子当特务时，把我抓走打了个死，现在政府把他枪决了，这回我可出了气啦，真是好政府呀！”
    沧、泊两镇，由于依靠与发动了广大群众力量，大张旗鼓地进行了镇压反革命宣传，所以，他们的工作是有很大成绩的。在这两镇，已经形成了一个轰轰烈烈的有领导、有计划、有秩序、有广大人民群众参加的肃清反革命运动。目前这个运动正在广泛深入的发展着。但是，泊镇党委没有注意把镇压反革命运动与抗美援朝、反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的运动密切结合起来，这在以后的运动中应该注意纠正的。（转载河北日报）
