To the Editor:

　　Since February of this year, the Hebei Provincial People's Government has made significant progress in handling letters from the masses and addressing their concerns, which has been well-received by the people. Previously, some departments of the Hebei Provincial People's Government lacked specialized institutions and systems for handling letters from the masses and addressing their concerns, and some staff members did not pay enough attention to this work. As a result, the problems and opinions raised by the masses were not resolved or answered in a timely and satisfactory manner, which affected the connection between the government and the people. For example, in the past, the General Office of the Hebei Provincial People's Government (formerly the General Secretariat) would forward letters from the masses to the relevant departments according to their nature, but rarely checked on the results of the handling. In January of last year, the Department of Industry received a letter from Zhao Dehua and Li Bohua from Changping County, requesting that the potassium carbonate they had trial-produced be tested. The Department of Industry did not have testing equipment and left the matter unattended. It was not until Zhao and Li published a notice in the newspaper inquiring about the matter that the Department of Industry forwarded the original to the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government for testing and provided a response. Another example is the case of Jia Fengshan from Qinli Village, Ding County, who was murdered (but not killed) by Zhao Wenyu. The Ding County People's Court failed to properly try the case. Jia Fengshan repeatedly appealed to the Provincial People's Court. Each time Jia Fengshan went, the Provincial People's Court would write a letter asking the lower-level authorities to investigate and deal with the matter, which was delayed for more than five months without resolution. As a result, Jia Fengshan walked to the train station with a sign on his back that read "Support the Communist Party, Down with the Dark Government of Ding County," which affected the government's prestige among the people. This matter was not seriously resolved until the provincial leading organs learned about it.

　　In order to correct this serious bureaucratic style of work and strengthen the connection between the government and the people, the Hebei Provincial People's Government issued a "Decision on Handling Mass Problems" on February 5 of this year and ordered governments at all levels to establish mass consultation offices, designating specific personnel to be responsible for handling the opinions raised by the masses. The Provincial People's Government has already achieved the goal of uniformly registering all letters from the masses or oral inquiries, and then forwarding them to the relevant departments for investigation and handling. Each letter is accompanied by a transmittal and feedback form to facilitate checking on the handling situation. For problems that cannot be answered immediately, the masses are first informed.

　　In one month, the Provincial People's Government received a total of 83 letters from the people, including 26 related to the work style of cadres, 9 reporting on counter-revolutionary elements and illegal activities, 6 related to work suggestions, 4 reporting on production situations, 18 appealing against the handling of problems by lower-level governments, 16 requesting the government to resolve or answer personal problems, and 4 others. The letter writers included farmers, People's Liberation Army soldiers, revolutionary cadres and their families, model workers, and mass representatives. These letters reflect many useful situations and positive suggestions, and provide valuable opinions for educating cadres and improving work style.

　　In the "Decision on Handling Mass Problems," the Hebei Provincial People's Government first pointed out that solving the problems raised by the masses is a matter of the people's government closely contacting the masses and correctly implementing the mass viewpoint of policies. Therefore, the decision stipulates specific methods for solving this problem: Handling the problems raised in letters from the masses or direct inquiries should be the responsibility of specific personnel designated by the secretarial departments (the General Office at the provincial level) and the sections and bureaus (the departments, bureaus, committees, and academies at the provincial level) of governments at all levels, under the leadership of the heads of their respective departments. Letters should be uniformly registered and forwarded by the secretarial department to the relevant departments for handling according to their nature. Responsible comrades must personally study the letters, promptly reply or forward them to lower levels for handling within a time limit, or send people to handle them on the spot, based on policies. For problems that are difficult to solve immediately, the writers should be informed in advance. In order to facilitate inspection and supervision, a transmittal and feedback system should be established, and regular summaries should be implemented. Lower-level governments must seriously handle the problems assigned to them by higher-level governments, and higher-level governments must supervise and inspect them. For incidents of accusing cadres, special personnel should be sent to investigate and handle them. If cadres retaliate or retaliate under the pretext of being accused or because the accusations are inconsistent with the facts, they should be resolutely stopped, and those who are serious should be given disciplinary sanctions. In order to closely contact the masses, people's governments at the provincial, special district, municipal, and county levels should all set up "Mass Consultation Offices" in front of their gates, equip them with capable cadres, and be responsible for receiving and talking with those who come to inquire; problems that cannot be solved face-to-face should be received and registered by the secretarial department and handled in the same way as letters.

### 河北省人民政府认真处理群众来信

　　河北省人民政府认真处理群众来信编辑同志：
    从今年二月以来，河北省人民政府在处理群众来信及群众来谈的工作上，有了很大的进步，群众反映良好。过去，河北省人民政府的某些部门，对处理群众的来信及来谈的意见，缺乏专门的机构和制度，某些工作人员对此又不够重视。因此，群众所提的问题和意见，得不到及时的解决和圆满的答复，影响了政府与群众的联系。如过去河北省人民政府秘书厅（即现在的办公厅）接到群众来信后，即按性质分别送交主管部门，至于办理结果如何，则很少检查。工业厅在去年一月接到昌平县赵德华、李伯华来信，请求化验他们试制的炭酸钾，工业厅没有化验设备，就把这事搁置不管。直到赵、李登报催询后，工业厅才将原件转到中央人民政府轻工业部进行了化验，并作了答复。再如定县秦里村贾凤山被赵文玉杀害（未死）一案，定县人民法院未能正确审理。贾凤山曾一再至省人民法院控诉。贾凤山每去一次，省人民法院即写一信让下级机关调查处理，结果竟拖延五个多月未得解决。贾凤山为此曾身背“拥护共产党，打倒定县黑暗政府”的牌子，走到车站，影响了政府在人民群众中的威信。这件事情，直至省领导机关知道后，才得到认真地解决。
    河北省人民政府为了纠正这种严重的官僚主义作风，密切政府与群众的联系，曾于今年二月五日作出“关于处理群众问题的决定”，并令各级政府设立群众问事处，指定专人负责处理群众所提出的意见。省人民政府对于群众来信或口头询问，已经做到先统一登记，然后分别送交有关部门调查处理。在每一信件上，附有交办回报表，以便检查处理情形。对于不能立即答复的问题，均先向群众声明。
    一个月来省人民政府共收到人民来信八十三封，其中有关干部作风的二十六件，检举反革命分子及不法行为的九件，有关工作建议的六件，报告生产情况的四件，对下级政府处理的问题不服而上告的十八件，请求政府解决或解答个人问题的十六件，其他四件。来信的人有农民、人民解放军战士、革命干部及其家属、劳动模范、群众代表等。这些来信中，已经答复处理的十五件，正在调查研究或转下级政府机关调查研究的六十五件，其余三件因没有地址、姓名不能寄复。从这些来信中，反映出许多有益的情况和积极建议，提供了教育干部，改进作风的宝贵意见。          河北省人民政府办公厅
　　　　附：河北省人民政府“关于处理群众问题的决定”的摘要
    河北省人民政府在“关于处理群众问题的决定”中，首先指出解决群众所提出的问题，是人民政府密切联系群众、正确贯彻政策的群众观点问题。因此，该决定中规定了具体解决这个问题的方法：处理群众来信或直接询问中所提出的问题，应由各级政府之秘书部门（省为办公厅）及各科、局（省为各厅、局、会、院）指定专人在本部门首长领导下负责进行。对于来信应统一登记，由秘书部门按性质交有关部门办理。负责同志必须亲自研究，根据政策及时答复或转交下级限期处理，或派人就地处理。一时难以解决的问题应向来信人预作声明。为了便于检查督促，应建立交办回报制度，并实行定期的总结。责成下级政府处理之问题，下级政府须认真办理，上级政府须督促检查。对于控诉干部的事件，应派专人调查处理，干部如有因被控诉或因控诉与事实不符而借故打击、报复者，应坚决制止，严重者给以法纪制裁。为了密切联系群众，省、专署、市、县各级人民政府均应在门前设立“群众问事处”配备有力干部，负责与来问者接谈；不能当面解决之问题，由秘书部门接谈登记后，仍按来信处理。
