More Than 8,000 Townships in Central South China Have Completed Land Reform
Emancipated Peasants Actively Accumulate Fertilizer and Build Water Conservancy Projects to Welcome Spring Plowing

Since the land reform work in various provinces of the Central South Region began last November, it has achieved great results in nearly five months. Currently, more than 8,500 townships in the six provinces of the region have completed land reform, and more than 10,000 townships are in progress. In areas where land reform has been completed, approximately 14 million landless or land-poor peasants have received an average of about 700 jin of land per person in terms of annual yield, which basically meets their land requirements. The peasants also received a portion of the cattle, farm tools, houses, and grain. The emancipated peasants are now busy farming, accumulating fertilizer, and building water conservancy projects to welcome spring plowing. The villages undergoing land reform are striving to basically complete the distribution of land before the busy spring plowing season arrives.

In this land reform in the Central South Region, generally speaking, all localities have correctly implemented the policy of "relying on poor and hired peasants and uniting with middle peasants" to boldly mobilize the masses, and the peasant ranks have been greatly developed. The number of members of the Henan Provincial Peasants' Association has reached more than 9.7 million. In the more than 3,700 townships in Jiangxi Province that have completed or are undergoing land reform, the number of members of the Peasants' Association has expanded from 1.2 million before land reform to 3.1 million, accounting for approximately 35% to 40% of the rural population. More than 100,000 peasant activists who have close ties with the broad masses have emerged in the land reform movement. The province's militia has also grown more than three times larger than before land reform. According to a survey of ten counties including Leping, Ji'an, and Nankang, a total of more than 1.6 million people are united around the Peasants' Association and directly participate in the land reform struggle, reaching 80% of the total rural population of the ten counties.

The more successful method of mobilizing the broad masses of peasants in various places is to combine the peasants' representative meeting with individual "visits to the poor to inquire about their suffering." The advantage of the peasants' representative meeting is that it can widely connect with the masses, easily concentrate the opinions of the majority of peasants, and is particularly effective in conducting current affairs education and publicizing policies, as well as solving important township-wide issues and unifying mass actions. However, it is not enough to rely solely on publicity and mobilization at meetings and the activities of a few representatives. It is necessary to combine it with the method of "visiting the poor to inquire about their suffering" so that cadres can go deep into individual poor peasant households and slowly enlighten the peasants to speak out their grievances and raise their class consciousness in a friendly manner. Then, these awakened peasants will connect with the masses (especially poor and hired peasants) and gradually expand the peasant ranks.

In addition, in leading the land reform movement in the new areas, the experience of various places in Central South China is that the following important links must be correctly grasped: First, in terms of the guiding method of the movement, it is necessary to firmly grasp the law of "from point to surface, combining point and surface" and developing in a wave-like manner. We should start with a few key townships and absorb peasant representatives from nearby villages (i.e., attached points) to participate in learning; in this way, cadres can be used more centrally, experience can be created, and influence can be expanded. After the work in the key townships has come to an end, a group of cadres and peasant representatives from nearby villages will be drawn to expand the movement to nearby villages. At this time, these nearby villages will become the second batch of new key points, and the land reform work will be rapidly and orderly carried out throughout the district or county in this wave-like manner. Second, in the process of land reform, we should first mobilize the masses to defeat the political prestige of the landlord class, and then can we achieve the complete abolition of the feudal land system in the economy. According to the general experience of various places, we should first start with anti-hegemony and suppressing the activities of counter-revolutionary elements, combined with the struggle to re-examine rent reduction; the main focus is on overthrowing the power holders of the landlord class. Then, we will turn to dividing rural classes, clarifying class boundaries, and further raising the political consciousness of the peasants, and launch a full-scale offensive against the landlord class; and combine it with the struggle against the landlord's decentralization and concealment of land and property. After the various classes in the countryside have been accurately divided, we can begin to confiscate, requisition, and distribute land. Third, land reform must be closely combined with resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionary elements, and rural production. For example, some areas have combined the land reform movement with the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, launched extensive current affairs propaganda among the masses, exposed various rumors fabricated by the landlord class, and made the broad masses further realize the conspiracy of the landlord class to collude with the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries from many vivid facts, further enhancing the fighting spirit of the masses and greatly promoting the land reform work.

### 中南八千多乡已完成土地改革  翻身农民积极积肥兴修水利迎接春耕

　　中南八千多乡已完成土地改革
    翻身农民积极积肥兴修水利迎接春耕
    中南区各省的土地改革工作，自去年十一月开始后，近五个月来已获得巨大成绩。目前全区六个省已有八千五百多个乡完成了土地改革，另有一万多个乡正在进行。在已经完成土地改革的地区，约有一千四百多万无地或少地的农民，每人平均分得的土地，其常年产量约在七百斤左右，基本上可以满足他们的土地要求。农民并分得了一部分耕牛、农具、房屋和粮食。翻身农民现正忙着耕田、积肥和兴修水利等工作，迎接春耕生产。正在进行土地改革的乡村，争取在春耕的紧张季节到来前基本上完成分配土地。
    中南区在这次土地改革中，一般说各地都正确贯彻了“依靠贫农、雇农，团结中农”的放手发动群众的方针，农民队伍得到很大发展。河南省农民协会会员已达九百七十多万人。在江西省已经完成和正在进行土地改革的三千七百多个乡里，农民协会会员已由土地改革前一百二十万人扩大到三百一十万人，约占农村人口百分之三十五到百分之四十。土地改革运动中并涌现了十余万与广大群众有密切联系的农民积极分子。全省民兵武装也比土地改革前壮大了三倍多。据乐平、吉安、南康等十个县调查，团结在农民协会周围直接参加土地改革斗争的群众，共有一百六十多万人，已达该十县农村总人口的百分之八十。
    各地发动广大农民的较为成功的办法是把农民代表会议与个别“访贫访苦”两种方式结合进行。农民代表会议的好处可以广泛联系群众，容易集中大多数农民的意见，特别对进行时事教育和宣传政策，以及解决全乡性重要问题、统一群众行动等方面，都有很大成效。但单靠会议上的宣传动员和少数代表的活动是不够的，必须结合“访贫访苦”的方法，使干部深入到个别贫苦农户中去，以交朋友的方式，慢慢启发农民诉苦，提高其阶级觉悟。然后再由这些觉悟了的农民串连群众（特别是贫雇农），逐步扩大农民的队伍。
    此外，在领导新区土地改革运动中，中南各地的经验是必须正确掌握以下几个重要环节：第一、在运动的指导方法上，必须紧紧掌握“由点到面、点面结合”波浪式发展的规律。首先应从几个重点乡做起，吸收附近乡村（即附点）农民代表参加学习；这样就可以使干部的使用较为集中，创造经验，扩大影响。待重点乡工作告一段落，再从重点乡抽出一批干部和附近乡农民代表，把运动扩展到附近乡村。这时，附近这些乡村又成为第二批新的重点，依此波浪式地逐步扩展，使土地改革工作迅速而又有秩序地在全区或全县展开。第二、在土地改革过程中，应首先发动群众打落地主阶级政治上的统治威风，然后方能达到在经济上彻底废除封建的土地制度。根据各地一般的经验，首先应从反恶霸、镇压反革命分子的活动入手，结合复查减租的斗争；主要在于打倒地主阶级的当权派。然后即转入划分农村阶级，分清阶级界限，进一步提高农民的政治觉悟，向地主阶级展开全面进攻；并结合进行反对地主分散和隐瞒土地、财产的斗争。待农村各个阶级划分准确之后，即可开始没收、征收和分配土地。第三、土地改革必须与抗美援朝、镇压反革命分子及农村生产密切结合进行。如有些地区土地改革运动中结合了抗美援朝工作，在群众中展开了广泛的时事宣传，揭穿了地主阶级捏造的各种谣言，并使广大群众从许多生动事实中进一步认识地主阶级与美、蒋反动派相互勾结的阴谋，更加提高了群众的斗争情绪，大大推动了土地改革工作。（新华社）
