　　Suffering Severe Blows from the Korean and Chinese People in the War of Aggression Against Korea
    US Far East Army Commander MacArthur Dismissed
    Ridgway Replaces MacArthur to Continue the War of Aggression, Still Unable to Save the US from Defeat on the Korean Battlefield.
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 13th] US Far East Aggressor Army Commander MacArthur has been dismissed as a result of suffering severe armed blows from the Korean and Chinese people while commanding the war of aggression against Korea. This is a victory for the Korean and Chinese people's struggle against US aggression. His successor is Lieutenant General Ridgway, commander of the US Eighth Army, who is currently directly commanding operations on the Korean battlefield. The order to dismiss MacArthur was announced by US President Truman on April 11th. Truman announced the removal of MacArthur from all his positions, including Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, "Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces," Far East Commander, and Commander of the US Army in the Far East. Prior to the decision to remove MacArthur, fierce recriminations and disputes had erupted within the US ruling group and the imperialist camp due to repeated disastrous defeats and serious difficulties encountered in the war of aggression against Korea. Ridgway's transfer from his position as commander of the US Eighth Army in the aggression against Korea to replace MacArthur indicates the US imperialists' determination to persist in their military adventure in Korea, but he will certainly not be able to save the US aggressors from defeat on the Korean battlefield. In a statement to reporters on April 1st, Ridgway publicly admitted that the war of aggression against Korea was facing a huge crisis and that the war was becoming increasingly difficult for the United States. And the day after MacArthur was dismissed, on April 12th, the US aggressors again dispatched more than 70 aircraft to intrude into our Northeast airspace, bomb our Andong urban and suburban areas, and kill our peaceful residents, still carrying out the crime of expanding the war of aggression.

　　在侵朝战争中遭受朝中人民严重打击
    美远东军总司令麦克阿瑟下台
    李奇微替麦克阿瑟继续进行侵略战争，同样不能挽救美国在朝鲜战场上的败局。
    【新华社十三日讯】美国远东侵略军总司令麦克阿瑟已因在指挥侵略朝鲜的战争中遭受朝鲜和中国人民的武装的严重打击而下台。这是中朝人民抗美斗争的胜利。继任他的是现在朝鲜战场直接指挥作战的美国第八军军长李奇微。撤销麦克阿瑟职务的命令是美国总统杜鲁门在四月十一日公布的。杜鲁门宣布撤销麦克阿瑟的各项职务，包括盟军最高统帅，“联合国军总司令”，远东总司令和远东美国陆军统帅。在决定把麦克阿瑟撤职以前，由于侵朝战争遭到多次惨败并遇到严重困难，美国统治集团内部和帝国主义阵营内部曾发生剧烈的相互埋怨和争吵。李奇微从侵略朝鲜的美国第八军军长的职务上调去代替麦克阿瑟，表明美帝国主义决心坚持对朝鲜的军事冒险勾当，但他决不能挽救美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上的败局。李奇微四月一日在对记者的谈话中，曾公开承认侵朝战争存在巨大危机，战争对美国变得越发艰苦。而在麦克阿瑟被撤职的第二天，即四月十二日，美国侵略者又派遣了七十多架飞机，侵入我东北领空，轰炸我安东市区和郊外，杀害我和平居民，仍在进行扩大侵略战争的罪行。
