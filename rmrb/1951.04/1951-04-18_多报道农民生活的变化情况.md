Reader's Letter

    Fan Mingxi, of No. 1, Special, Hanjiang Fourth Road, Hankou City, suggests:

    I found the "Investigation Report on Rural Wuxiang, Shanxi" published in the People's Daily last October and the article "Some Situations in Rural Henan After Land Reform" written by Comrade Zhang Xi, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, published on March 12 this year, to be of great significance. From these two articles, I saw the achievements accumulated in our work, which increased our infinite work enthusiasm and confidence.

    However, we feel that your newspaper publishes relatively little in this regard, which can be said to be unsatisfactory to us. Therefore, I suggest that your newspaper send some reporters to go deep into the countryside to do some investigation work on the changes in rural life and write news reports. The writing angle may start from the transformation process of a farmer, a farmer's family, a village, or the economy, politics, and ideology of a township, and should highlight the strong contrast between the new and old lives. But we also oppose that kind of list-like, unnatural comparison method. I firmly believe that writing about the changes in farmers' lives after liberation will definitely become an encouragement to the people in the newly liberated areas that are implementing land reform.

    多报道农民生活的变化情况
    汉口市汉江四路特一号范明稀来信建议说：
    人民日报去年十月间所刊登的“山西武乡农村考察报告”，及今年三月十二日刊载的中共河南省委书记张玺同志所写的“土地改革后河南农村的若干情况”两文，我感到意义十分重大。从这两篇文章里看出了我们工作积累起来的成绩，使我们增加了无限的工作热情和信心。
    但我们感到贵报刊载这方面的东西还比较少，可以说不能令我们感到满足。因此我建议贵报酌情派出一些记者，深入农村做一些农村生活变化的考察工作，写成通讯报道。写作的角度不妨从一个农民，一家农民或一个村庄，或一个乡的经济、政治、思想意识的转变过程着手，并要衬托出强烈的新旧生活的对比。但我们也反对那种罗列式的不自然的比较方法。我深信，写解放后农民生活的变化，对正在实行土地改革的新解放地区的人民定会成为一种鼓舞力量。
