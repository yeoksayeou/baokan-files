The People's Representative Conferences held in the 30 districts of the city have focused on discussing the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Representatives from various circles in many districts have also formulated patriotic anti-special agent pacts. The broad masses of workers in Shanghai have actively reported counter-revolutionary elements to the government. On April 9, the Public Security Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government arrested a group of special agents hiding in various factories. On the 10th, the Public Security Bureau, in response to the demands of the broad masses of people, arrested a group of local bullies who had consistently committed murder, robbery, rape, and plunder. The people of all districts strongly supported this measure by the government, holding meetings and suggesting that the Second Session of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference should focus on discussing the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. On April 10, Nanjing held a mobilization rally for people from all walks of life to implement the central government's regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries. On that day, more than 400,000 people listened to the live broadcast of the conference.

According to statistics, 146 counter-revolutionary elements were reported in just half a day.

This group of counter-revolutionary elements has been shot on the spot.

	Northwest Region: People of all ethnic groups and all walks of life warmly support the People's Government's severe punishment of counter-revolutionary criminals. The People's Governments of Xi'an, Lanzhou, Dihua, Yinchuan, Xining, and other places accepted the demands of the people of all ethnic groups and successively executed a group of counter-revolutionary elements. During the Qingming Festival, at a public memorial service for martyrs in Xi'an with more than 10,000 people, people from all walks of life accused counter-revolutionary elements. In early April, people from all walks of life in Xi'an reported more than 70 special agents; some hidden counter-revolutionary elements registered out of fear of the people's power. In response to the demands of the Hui and Han people, the Linxia Municipal People's Government of Gansu Province executed a group of arch-criminals on March 26. People from all walks of life cheered, and mass organizations spontaneously held forums, expressing their willingness to assist the government in arresting bandits and special agents who have not yet been brought to justice.

	Southwest Region: The suppression of counter-revolutionaries in Chongqing has formed a mass movement. Workers and nearby residents from five factories, including the 21st and 29th factories in the city, held anti-special agent rallies, accusing the special agents of their crimes and assisting the government in arresting and reporting counter-revolutionary elements.
