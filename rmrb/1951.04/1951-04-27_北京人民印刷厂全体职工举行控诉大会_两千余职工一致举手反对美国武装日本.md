The Beijing People's Printing Factory held an accusation and signature meeting against the US arming of Japan at 5:00 PM on the 21st of this month. All workers in the factory participated in the meeting, including older workers and technicians who had not previously been very concerned about current affairs. Everyone listened to the blood and tears of the victims with激憤 [ji fen - righteous indignation]. When Peng Cuirong, a female worker from the packaging department, recounted how her father's ears were cut off by the Japanese devils, who then forced him to eat them, many people were so激憤 [ji fen - filled with righteous indignation] that they shed tears. Worker Liang Ruigang accused the Japanese devils of pressing him under a shoulder pole three times, and then the US-Chiang reactionaries came and drove him out of the factory. Worker Yu Hong recalled the days of eating wild vegetables under the rule of the enemy puppets, his whole body swollen, unable to eat enough, living a life worse than death. These painful experiences, personally experienced by many workers, stirred up everyone's old and new hatred. Some people were so saddened that they cried while submitting their slips. Old worker Zhang Hanshou, who had been working for more than thirty years, said, "In the past, I thought my life was hard because of my bad fate, but now I know it was caused by imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. I want to go on stage and talk to everyone about it." Amidst the grief and憤怒 [fen nu - anger], worker Peng Cuirong proposed: "We must take action and not let the US and Japanese devils come and ruin us again!" The masses immediately shouted: "We must improve production and launch a patriotic production competition!" "We must establish a patriotic pact!" Finally, more than two thousand workers unanimously raised their hands to oppose the US arming of Japan and support the conclusion of a peace treaty.
