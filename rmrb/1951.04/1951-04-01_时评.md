Current Commentary

    (1) Strive to Rapidly Popularize the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
    In the notification issued by this Association on March 14th, we called on the people of urban and rural areas nationwide to hold small meetings as universally as possible in late April. At these meetings, they should denounce the crimes of Japanese and American aggression, as well as the crimes of Japanese and American running dogs and Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents in persecuting the people; hold signature campaigns in support of concluding a peace treaty; and hold voting on the Japanese issue. On May 1st, they should hold large-scale demonstrations as universally as possible, with resisting America, aiding Korea, opposing the arming of Japan, and defending world peace as the main themes of the demonstrations. Since the aforementioned notification of this Association was issued, the leading organs of the three major administrative regions of Northeast, East China, and Northwest, and Wuhan City, as well as people's organizations such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Youth Federation, have made specific arrangements within their respective scopes. We hope that the leading organs of all parties, groups, and levels in all regions, and all propaganda, education, and cultural institutions, can take action without further delay and work together to popularize the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.
    To hold rallies and demonstrations as universally as possible in all cities and villages across the country, and to concentrate these activities in late April and May Day, is a huge and urgent political mobilization effort. It requires immediate arrangements and timely promotion to cities, counties, districts, and townships. The leading organs and cadres of people's organizations at all levels in all regions, as well as reporters and propagandists, should study in detail the notification of this Association of March 14th and related documents, and use all gatherings to publicize the requirements of the aforementioned notification and its great political significance, calling on the masses to prepare to participate in these patriotic rallies and demonstrations. The leading organs of all groups at all levels in all regions should quickly assemble personnel engaged in popularizing Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work, provide them with short-term training or organize them for short-term study, and send them down to work in a timely manner. They should also refer to the methods of the Northwest Administrative Region to mobilize personnel engaged in mass work in rural areas (hundreds of thousands of such personnel are in the country) to assist in propaganda work. Leading organs at the provincial level (including major cities and administrative office districts) should immediately begin compiling concise and popular propaganda materials for use by propaganda teams, propagandists, and cadres at all levels in their respective regions. Newspapers and periodicals nationwide should strive to publicize the necessity of holding rallies and demonstrations in late April and May Day, and introduce to readers successful experiences in organizing denunciation meetings, organizing demonstrations, and conducting propaganda to the masses.

   (2) Current Propaganda Should Be Combined with Resisting America, Aiding Korea
    To implement patriotic education for resisting America and aiding Korea into the propaganda of all practical work tasks can not only make the propaganda of resisting America and aiding Korea richer, more in-depth and lasting, but, particularly importantly, can provide a great impetus to the completion of various practical work tasks. However, in this regard, whether in the written propaganda of newspapers and periodicals or in the oral propaganda of mass gatherings, there is often a disconnect between the two.
    Recently, the attention of many city people has been focused on the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and the attention of rural people has been focused on spring plowing. It is necessary to implement the propaganda of resisting America and aiding Korea into the propaganda of deploying the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and deploying spring plowing, simultaneously publicizing resisting America and aiding Korea in mass gatherings and propaganda materials promoting these central tasks, and explaining the connection between these central tasks and resisting America and aiding Korea, in order to continue to popularize and deepen patriotic education, and to promote the completion of the above-mentioned central tasks through this patriotic education. We hope that the leading organs in all regions, reporters, propagandists, newspaper and magazine editors, and writer comrades in all regions, will pay attention to combining these two kinds of propaganda.

   (3) Oppose the Casual Mobilization of the Masses to Parade and Present Flowers
    Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, people from all walks of life in various regions have widely held demonstrations and parades. These demonstrations and parades have played a great role in stimulating the patriotic sentiments of the masses and raising their political awareness, and are therefore entirely necessary. However, the masses should not be mobilized for demonstrations frequently and arbitrarily, as this will hinder the production, work, and study of the masses and cause waste of resources. It is precisely to prevent this phenomenon from occurring that the notification of this Association on March 14th stipulated that the meetings for denunciation, signing, and voting should be concentrated on a certain day in late April, and the demonstrations should be concentrated on May Day.
    However, the phenomenon of wasting manpower and resources has already been discovered in many cities. For example, in Chongqing, since the Spring Festival, there has been a demonstration almost every day in the urban area, and some working cadres and mass organizations mobilize the masses to parade at every turn. Sometimes it is a parade of the masses from one or several schools or factories, and sometimes it is a parade of residents from one street or one section, and traffic is often blocked by the parade. In addition, the masses frequently present flags and flowers, and present flags and flowers at every turn, resulting in expensive flower prices in the city. If this phenomenon of frequently mobilizing the masses to parade and present flowers continues, it will inevitably delay work, hinder production and study, and make both cadres and the masses feel it is a burden. After discovering the above phenomenon, the leading organs of Chongqing Municipality issued instructions to the districts and people's organizations in the city in March to earnestly correct it, pointing out that the enthusiasm of the masses should be cherished and excessive fatigue of the masses should be avoided. The instructions also specifically stipulated that in the future, except for commemorative festivals, work holidays, Spring Festival, and temporarily stipulated occasions that must be carried out as stipulated by the State Council, if districts and mass organizations need to hold mass rallies or parades, they must be approved by the municipal leading organs; except for the first city-wide representative meetings convened by mass organizations and the people's representative meetings of each district, it is forbidden to mobilize the masses to present flags and flowers at general meetings and festivals.
    The above-mentioned regulations of the leading organs of Chongqing Municipality are necessary and correct. All regions should pay attention to correcting phenomena such as arbitrarily mobilizing the masses to parade and present flowers.

    时评
   （一）为迅速普及抗美援朝运动而努力
    本会在三月十四日发出的通告中，号召全国城乡人民在四月下旬尽可能普遍地举行小型的会议，在这些会议上控诉日美侵略的罪行以及日美走狗蒋匪特务迫害人民的罪行，举行拥护缔结和平公约的签名，举行日本问题的投票；并在五月一日尽可能普遍地举行大示威，以抗美援朝、反对武装日本、保卫世界和平为示威的主要内容。自本会上述通告发出以后，东北、华东、西北三个大行政区和武汉市的领导机关，以及全国总工会、全国民主青年联合会等人民团体，已就所属范围作了具体布置。我们希望，各党派、各团体各地各级的领导机关，所有宣传教育文化机构，能够不再延迟地采取行动，共同为普及抗美援朝运动而努力。
    要在全国所有城市和乡村都尽可能普遍地举行集会和示威游行，而且进行这些活动的时间又要求集中在四月下旬和五一节，这是一个十分巨大而紧迫的政治动员工作，需要立即动手布置起来，并且及时地推广到市、县和区、乡去。各人民团体各地各级的领导机关和干部，各地的报告员、宣传员，应当详细地研究本会三月十四日的通告及有关文件，并利用一切集会向人民群众宣传上述通告的要求及其巨大的政治意义，号召群众准备参加这些爱国集会和示威游行。各团体各地各级的领导机关应当迅速调集从事普及抗美援朝宣传工作的人员，加以短期训练或组织他们进行短期学习，及时地派遣他们下去工作，并应参照西北大行政区的办法，动员分布在农村从事群众工作的人员（这样的人员在全国有几十万）协助进行宣传工作。各省级（包括大市和行署区）领导机关，应当立即着手编印简明通俗的宣传资料，供给所属地区宣传队、宣传员和各级干部使用。全国的报纸刊物，应当努力宣传在四月下旬和五一节举行集会和示威的必要，并向读者介绍组织控诉会、组织示威游行以及向群众作宣传的成功经验。
   （二）当前的各项宣传要和抗美援朝相结合
    把抗美援朝的爱国教育贯彻到所有实际工作任务的宣传中去，不但可以使抗美援朝的宣传更加丰富更能深入和持久化，而且特别重要的是，这样可以使得各项实际工作任务的完成，获得一个伟大的推动力量。但是，在这个问题上，无论是在报纸刊物的文字宣传或者是在群众集会的口头宣传中，目前都时常发现两者互相脱节的现象。
  最近许多城市人民的注意力都集中到镇压反革命的工作上，乡村人民的注意力都集中到春耕的工作上。必须把抗美援朝的宣传贯彻到布置镇压反革命和布置春耕的宣传中去，在宣传这些中心工作的群众集会和宣传品中同时宣传抗美援朝，并阐明这些中心工作与抗美援朝的联系，才能继续普及深入爱国的教育，并经过这种爱国教育去推动上述中心工作的完成。我们希望各地的领导机关，各地的报告员、宣传员、报刊编辑和作家同志们，都要注意把这两种宣传结合起来。
   （三）反对随便动员群众游行献花
    抗美援朝运动展开以来，各地各界人民广泛地举行了示威游行。这种示威游行，对于激发人民群众的爱国情绪和提高人民群众的政治觉悟，起了伟大的作用，因此是完全必要的。但是，不可频繁地随意地动员群众游行示威，否则就将妨碍人民群众的生产、工作和学习，并造成物力的浪费。正是为了防止这种现象的发生，所以本会三月十四日的通告，才规定控诉、签名、投票的会议，集中于四月下旬的某一天举行，游行示威集中在五一节举行。
    但是不少城市已经发现浪费人力物力的现象。例如在重庆，春节以来，市区内几乎无日无示威，有些工作干部和群众团体，动不动就发动群众游行。有时是一个或几个学校或工厂的群众游行，有时是一条街或一个段的居民群众游行，交通常为游行队所阻断。此外，群众献旗献花也非常频繁，动不动就是献旗献花，以致市上鲜花价格昂贵。这种频繁地动员群众游行献花的现象继续下去，必将耽误工作，妨碍生产和学习，使干部和群众都感到是一种负担。重庆市领导机关在发现以上现象后，已于三月间指示该市各区及各人民团体加以切实纠正，指出应珍贵群众的热情，避免过分疲劳群众。该指示并且具体规定：今后除政务院规定的纪念节日、工假、春节及临时规定必须进行者以外，各区各群众团体如需举行群众大会或游行时，必须经市领导机关批准；除各群众团体召开的首次全市性的代表会议及各区人民代表会议外，一般的会议及节日，禁止动员群众献旗献花。
    重庆市领导机关的上述规定是必要的，正确的。各地都应该注意纠正任意动员群众游行献花等现象。
