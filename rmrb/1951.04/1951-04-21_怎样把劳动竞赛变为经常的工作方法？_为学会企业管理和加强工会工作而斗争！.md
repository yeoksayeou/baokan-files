How to Turn Labor Competition into a Regular Working Method?
　　Strive to Learn Enterprise Management and Strengthen Trade Union Work!
　　Dong Xin, Head of the Production Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

Currently, the patriotic labor competition has been widely carried out throughout the country. In particular, since the Ma Hengchang小组 (team/group) challenged workers nationwide, 5,522 advanced production teams have participated in the competition, launching a new upsurge of patriotic labor competition. Many enterprises and units in various regions have learned and promoted the experience of the Ma Hengchang小组 and other advanced 小组 (teams/groups) and advanced producers, greatly improving the labor competition. Many factories and mines have eliminated the phenomenon of突击 (campaign-style crash work), changed the situation of pure physical competition, and made the competition move towards normal development. In the Northeast region, especially in Shenyang, the planned and organized promotion of advanced experience has been taken as the basic content of the competition movement. In this way, the competition is more in-depth and universal, and labor productivity is constantly improving, setting an example of how to correctly conduct labor competition.

However, on a national scale, the competition in many factories and mines is often tight at the beginning and loose at the end. The main reason is the lack of concrete organizational leadership, or a bureaucratic attitude towards the spontaneous labor enthusiasm of the masses, resulting in the competition becoming a formality, unable to be sustained and consolidated, and even gradually declining. The JiaMusi City Federation of Trade Unions inspected the competition situation of 23 factories and found that only two factories could adhere to regular competition, 13 factories had intermittent competition, and eight factories had already declined. Similar situations exist in cities across the country. Many advanced production小组's (teams/groups) competition movements still have many formalism problems, such as generalized competition conditions, failure to combine competition with the improvement of enterprise management, and failure to improve workshop work, but only limited to within the小组 (team/group), etc. In short, the current competition movement is generally not in-depth and consolidated enough.

An important reason why the competition in many units cannot be sustained and consolidated is because of blind突击 (campaign-style crash work) and pure physical competition. Naturally, in the early stage of the competition,突击 (campaign-style crash work) is difficult to avoid. This is because the working masses after liberation have a preliminary political awareness, and their labor attitude has begun to change, often strengthening their labor intensity to express their labor enthusiasm. Secondly, enterprise management is also in the process of transformation and development, plans are not yet thorough, institutions and systems are not sound enough, especially the wage system is unreasonable, and it cannot yet adapt to the workers' high enthusiasm. Furthermore, cadres in various aspects lack experience in competition. Therefore, the competition from突击 (campaign-style crash work) to normal is a process of development. However, one-time突击 (campaign-style crash work) competition can never be sustained, and often gains outweigh the losses, such as shoddy manufacturing, damage to machines, etc. Therefore, how to guide the competition from突击 (campaign-style crash work) to normal and become a regular working method is the main topic of guiding labor competition at present. To solve this problem, there are several experiences in various regions:

First, strengthening patriotic ideological education and continuously improving the political awareness of the working masses is an important key to making competition a regular working method. Labor competition is a new labor attitude of the working masses under their own regime, and the establishment and consolidation of this labor attitude is inseparable from the improvement of the political awareness and technical level of the working masses. The great victory of the Chinese revolution awakened the consciousness of the working masses and provided conditions for the widespread development of competition. However, to consolidate and persist in the spontaneous enthusiasm of the masses, and to make the revolutionary labor attitude a new social morality, it is necessary to continuously improve their level of awareness politically, so that every worker truly understands the status of the working class today and their responsibility to the country, and the great future of communism. Only in this way can the competition become a conscious movement of the working class to regularly complete production plans in national construction. At present, we should seize the issues of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, opposing U.S. imperialism's arming of Japan, implementing labor insurance, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and adopt various methods to widely and deeply carry out propaganda and education among the working masses, stimulate the masses' patriotic enthusiasm, and thus organize regular labor competition on a conscious and voluntary basis. For example, a factory in Northeast China adopted the method of complaining about the hardships of the old society to expose the atrocities of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang, enlightened the masses, fundamentally changed the workers' attitude of "dragging their feet," and launched a competition. When the flames of the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Korea burned to the Yalu River, many factories in Northeast China widely carried out current affairs education, arousing the anger of the vast working masses against U.S. imperialism, and launching a patriotic labor competition. Experience has proved that the more widespread and in-depth the current affairs and policy education, the more widespread and in-depth the patriotic labor competition. A factory in Northeast China has made current affairs and policy study a regular system, and the competition in that factory has been consolidated and sustained, becoming a regular working method.

Therefore, using every political and economic event, combined with the actual situation of the masses, regularly and systematically carrying out patriotic ideological education, constantly stimulating the patriotic enthusiasm of the working masses, inspiring their sense of ownership, improving their class consciousness, and cultivating their new moral concepts of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving science, loving labor, and cherishing public property, can consolidate the production competition regularly and persistently, and gradually become the working masses' daily and hourly labor style and lifestyle.

Second, the competition should be closely combined with the transformation of old enterprises and the improvement of business management. Especially when we lack sufficient experience in enterprise management, relying on the masses, organizing competitions to gradually establish various new scientific management systems can more practically solve the problems in all aspects of the unit's business management. The Northeast has formulated advanced quotas and implemented the economic accounting system in the new record movement. A factory has gathered various experiences of the working masses in the competition and their opinions on the management department, and formulated various business regulations and standard operating methods, as well as 14 other reporting systems. The Zhang Yichang小组 (team/group) of Shenyang Chemical Factory, with the concrete help of technicians, improved the operating methods, which were adopted by the administration and formulated into new technical regulations, and implemented in the entire factory. This can not only enable the advanced to lead the backward, and achieve the goal of universal improvement, but also strengthen technical management work.

An important way to promote business management in the competition is to hold regular production meetings in workshops and小组s (teams/groups) to check the competition work, mobilize the masses to expose problems in business management from all aspects, and study solutions for adoption and implementation by the administrative department. In this way, the mass competition movement has promoted business management. Developing deeper and deeper step by step, so that the competition becomes the driving force for transforming enterprise management.

Third, promote the contract system. The collective contract is an important method to organize the continuous rise of workers' labor enthusiasm, and it is also a concrete method to implement management democratization and enterprise management, and it is the best form to ensure the competition is regular and persistent.

The contract should stipulate the production tasks, so that all employees have a clear goal to strive for. The contract should stipulate the responsibilities and guarantees of both the administration and the workers, stipulate the wage and reward methods, and stipulate the methods to improve the cultural and material lives of the workers on the basis of developing production. This greatly strengthens the sense of responsibility of the working masses, enables the workers to exert the greatest enthusiasm and creativity in production, and at the same time, it can improve the work of the administrative management department. The experiences of the Soviet Union and the Northeast have confirmed this role. A factory in the Northeast signed a collective contract, completed and exceeded the state's tasks. After the workers created huge wealth for the country, their cultural and material lives were also improved. As a result, many factories set up workers' children's schools, clinics, and spare-time sanatoriums, built clubs, bought movie projectors, and solved workers' welfare problems, inspiring the masses and making the competition enthusiasm often full. Other examples, such as the Fengtai Locomotive Depot and the Dongguan Sugar Factory in Guangdong, have greatly promoted the production movement because of the signing of collective contracts. Collective contracts can also unify the pace of the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League in factories and enterprises, concentrate all forces, and strive to complete production plans and improve the material and cultural lives of employees.

The production plans and quotas of many factories and mines are not accurate, and the wage system is unreasonable. Therefore, there are certain difficulties in signing comprehensive contracts. However, according to the specific situation, it is possible to sign contracts on issues that are more certain. Through the contract, it can promote the emergence of more accurate plans, formulate more reasonable quotas, and implement the economic accounting system. Therefore, the idea of ​​many administrative management cadres who are unwilling to sign collective contracts is wrong.

In private enterprises, signing collective contracts is a necessary way to organize competitions and do a good job in production.

Fourth, according to the factory's production plan, mobilizing the workers to discuss and formulate personal and小组 (team/group) production plans is the basic method of organizing competition. With a production plan, everyone has a clear goal to strive for. This plan can become a condition for competition, and the inspection of the competition has a basis.

The formulation of production plans or competition conditions should generally include the content of how much to complete and exceed the production plan, to what extent the product quality should reach, and how much to save raw materials and reduce costs, and the methods for technical learning and ensuring the completion of these conditions should be specified. The experience of a factory in the Northeast is: to take production as the center, the weaknesses and difficulties of the group as the focus, and combine the current tasks and specific requirements of the workshop to formulate a production plan. Only by finding the key problems in production and specifically and flexibly stipulating the tasks of each person and each group can the plan not be generalized or become a formality. The小组 (team/group) covenant plays a major role in the competition, which can not only start competition between individuals, but also give play to the collective creativity. This is on the one hand, to concretize the state's production plan and become each worker's own plan, and at the same time, there is the小组's (team/group's) collective conscious supervision role to promote workshop work. A factory in the Northeast took the小组's (team/group's) collective covenant movement as the basic method of the factory's regular competition, adhered to it for more than a year, and it is still a powerful form for organizing competition and ensuring the completion of production tasks. Therefore, making out personal production plans, plus小组 (team/group) covenants or patriotic covenants, and linking contracts or competition treaties, can connect individuals,小组s (teams/groups), and workshops vertically and horizontally, and organize both direct production and indirect production personnel, and both production departments and management departments into the competition. Only by moving everything in this way can the competition be maintained regularly.

Fifth, advocate the combination of manual and mental labor, and the combination of labor and technology. The method of combining labor and technology is first to strengthen the technical learning of the working masses, continuously improve their technical proficiency, and strictly implement technical operating procedures and safety regulations. The second is to strengthen the unity of workers and technicians, so that the rich experience of the working masses is combined with the scientific knowledge of technicians. The third is to carry out rationalization proposals, improve technology, improve labor organization, and advocate inventions and creations. Only in this way can the competition avoid pure physical competition. Many regions and many factories have this experience. For example, after the experience of Jiang Wanshou of Shenyang Garment Factory No. 1 in improving labor organization was promoted, the labor productivity of Shenyang's garment industry system increased by 25%, and the 1951 task could be completed three months ahead of schedule. Chu Hongyi of Shenyang Railway Factory learned Kovalev's working method and increased work efficiency by three times. Zhang Yichang of Shenyang Chemical Factory was originally a carpenter, but with the help of technicians, he became a chemical worker, and made technical improvements, which improved production efficiency. Therefore, trade union cadres must go deep into the production process, study the experience of advanced producers, and promote it. To make the experience of advanced producers mastered by every worker is to realize the basic principle of competition. Only when the technical level of the vast working masses is continuously improved and the promotion of advanced experience becomes the basic method of guiding the competition can the phenomenon of突击 (campaign-style crash work) be overcome and gradually develop towards a higher level form.

Sixth, implement the policy of taking into account both public and private interests, and labor and capital. The first is to implement a reasonable wage system. This is the material guarantee for making the competition from突击 (campaign-style crash work) to regular. However, we have not yet widely promoted the piece-rate wage system, and there are still many unreasonable aspects of the current wage system that have not been adjusted, which greatly hinders the development of the competition. Therefore, before the state officially and comprehensively reforms the wage system, it is also necessary to appropriately adjust unreasonable aspects in order to inspire the labor enthusiasm of the working masses. Secondly, various spiritual and material reward systems should be implemented. From direct production personnel to auxiliary production personnel, there should be certain reward methods. According to the experience of a factory in the Northeast, in order to make the reward play a greater role, it is necessary to act in accordance with regulations, and to reward flexibly and timely. The third is to implement the government's labor laws, improve labor protection work, and regularly conduct safety and health inspections, formulate various systems and methods, and implement them. However, the administrative and trade union organizations of many factories and mines have not paid due attention to this issue, and often the number of accidents increases during the competition, and there are many problems in life and housing, such as poor food and poor toilets, which cannot be solved immediately. In fact, some problems can be solved by organizing workers to do it themselves, which is easy to do. However, because it was not dealt with in time, it affected the workers' emotions and hindered the development and consolidation of the competition. The Shenyang Jin Dejiang小组 (team/group) organized workers to assist the administration in improving labor conditions and living conditions, which improved the workers' production enthusiasm.

Seventh, strengthen the leadership of the competition, and the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League should have consistent thinking and coordinated actions. Establish and improve the inspection system for the competition. Adopt methods such as glory lists, production charts, blackboards, and broadcasts to conduct criticism and praise, and establish regular agitation work. Pay attention to cultivating the models of小组s (teams/groups) and workshops and labor models. Regularly convene meetings of labor models and advanced producers, regularly study and summarize experience, and promote advanced experience in a planned and universal way. Only in this way can the competition continue to have fresh content and continue to develop.

Carrying out the Ma Hengchang小组 (team/group) competition movement is the key to raising the labor competition to a higher level. This movement has been widely carried out in regions and industries. Concrete help should be given to those advanced小组s (teams/groups) participating in the competition, their experience should be disseminated, and the competition movement in the workshop and factory should be promoted. In areas where the competition has not been carried out or has been carried out less, efforts should be concentrated on key cultivation, absorbing experience, and promoting小组 (team/group) competition. If小组 (team/group) competition is done well, it can then be done well in a workshop or a factory. In order to make the competition develop steadily, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the workshop over the competition, because the workshop is the basic unit of production, and小组s (teams/groups) cannot be isolated from the requirements of the workshop.

　　怎样把劳动竞赛变为经常的工作方法？
    为学会企业管理和加强工会工作而斗争！
    中华全国总工会生产部部长  董昕
    目前全国各地爱国主义劳动竞赛已经有了相当广泛的开展。特别是马恒昌小组向全国工人挑战后，已有五千五百二十二个先进生产小组参加竞赛运动，开展了爱国主义劳动竞赛的新高潮。许多地区的企业单位，学习与推广了马恒昌小组及其他先进小组与先进生产者的经验，使劳动竞赛大大提高了一步。许多厂矿单位消除了突击现象，改变了单纯体力比赛的情况，使竞赛走向正常的发展。在东北地区，尤其是沈阳市，已把有计划有组织地推广先进经验，作为竞赛运动的基本内容。这样，竞赛更加深入与普遍，劳动生产效率不断地提高，给如何正确地进行劳动竞赛作出了榜样。
    但就全国范围来讲，许多厂矿单位的竞赛还常常是前紧后松的。其主要的原因是，缺少具体的组织领导工作，或则对群众自发的劳动热情，采取官僚主义的态度，以致竞赛流于形式，不能坚持巩固，甚至逐渐消沉。佳木斯市总工会检查了二十三个工厂的竞赛情况，发现能够坚持经常竞赛的仅有两个厂，竞赛若断若续的有十三个厂，已经消沉下去的有八个厂。全国各城市都有类似情况。许多先进生产小组竞赛运动中还存在着许多形式主义，如竞赛条件一般化，竞赛未与改善企业经营管理相结合，竞赛未把车间工作提高一步，而只局限于小组内等等。总之，当前的竞赛运动一般还是不够深入和巩固的。
    许多单位的竞赛不能坚持巩固的重要原因，是由于盲目突击，单纯体力比赛。自然，在竞赛初期，突击现象很难避免，这是由于解放后的工人群众有了初步政治觉悟，劳动态度开始转变，往往以加强劳动强度，来表现他们的劳动热情。其次企业管理也处在改造发展过程中，计划还不周密，机构、制度不够健全，特别是工资制度不合理，还不能适应工人群众的高涨的热情。再就是各方面的干部对竞赛还缺少经验。因此，竞赛由突击到正常，是一个发展的过程。但是，突击一时的竞赛，绝不能持久，而且往往得不偿失，如粗制滥造，损坏机器等等。因此，如何引导竞赛从突击到正常，成为经常的工作方法，是当前指导劳动竞赛的主要课题。解决这个问题，各地已有这样几点经验：
    一、加强爱国主义的思想教育，不断提高工人群众的政治觉悟，是使竞赛成为经常的工作方法的重要关键。劳动竞赛是工人群众在自己的政权下的一种新的劳动态度，而这种劳动态度的树立与巩固，是与工人群众政治觉悟与技术水平的提高分不开的。中国革命伟大的胜利，唤醒了工人群众的觉悟，具备了广泛开展竞赛的条件。但要把群众的自发热情巩固起来并坚持下去，使得革命的劳动态度成为新的社会道德，就需要不断地在政治上提高其觉悟程度，使每一个工人真正懂得今天工人阶级的地位与对国家的责任，和共产主义的伟大前程，这样，才能使竞赛成为工人阶级在国家建设中经常完成生产计划的自觉运动。目前应该抓紧抗美援朝、反对美帝国主义武装日本、实施劳动保险与镇压反革命等问题，采取各种方式，广泛深入地在工人群众中进行宣传教育，激发群众的爱国热情，从而在自觉自愿的基础上组织经常的劳动竞赛。比如东北某工厂，采取诉苦运动的方式，控诉了日本帝国主义和国民党的暴行，启发了群众的觉悟，基本上转变了工人的“磨洋工”的态度，发动了竞赛。当美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战火燃烧到鸭绿江边时，东北许多工厂广泛地进行了时事教育，激起广大工人群众对美帝国主义的愤怒，发动了爱国主义劳动竞赛。经验证明，时事政策教育愈广泛深入，爱国主义劳动竞赛也越广泛深入。东北某厂把时事政策学习形成为经常制度，该厂竞赛也就巩固持久成为经常的工作方法。
    因此，利用每一个政治的经济的事件，结合群众的实际情况，经常地系统地进行爱国主义的思想教育，不断地激发工人群众的爱国热情，启发其主人翁的感觉，提高其阶级觉悟，培养其爱祖国、爱人民、爱科学、爱劳动、爱护公共财物的新的道德观念，才能将生产竞赛经常持久地巩固下去，以至逐渐成为工人群众每日每时的劳动方式与生活方式。
    二、竞赛要与改造旧企业，改善经营管理密切结合。尤其当我们对于企业管理还缺乏足够的经验的时候，依靠群众，组织竞赛逐渐树立各种新的科学的管理制度，才能更实际地解决本单位经营管理各方面的问题。东北已在新纪录运动中，制定了先进的定额，贯彻了经济核算制。某工厂把工人群众在竞赛中的各种经验和对于管理部门的意见，集中起来，制定了各种业务规程和标准操作法，及其他十四种表报制度。沈阳市化学工厂张义昌小组在竞赛中，取得技术人员的具体帮助，改进了操作方法，经行政采纳制订为新的技术规程，在全厂实行。这样不仅可以使先进带动落后，达到普遍提高的目的，而且也加强了技术管理工作。
    在竞赛中推进经营管理工作的重要方式，是定期召开车间、小组的生产会议，检查竞赛工作，发动群众从各方面揭发经营管理上的问题，并研究解决的方法，交行政部门采纳实行。这样群众竞赛运动就推动了经营管理工作。一步一步地向前深入发展下去，使竞赛成为改造企业管理的动力。
    三、推广合同制。集体合同是组织工人劳动热情不断上涨的重要方法，也是贯彻管理民主化与经营企业化的具体方法，是保证竞赛经常持久的最好的形式。
    合同应规定生产任务，使全体职工有了明确的奋斗目标。合同应规定行政与工人双方的职责与保证条件，规定工资与奖励办法，在发展生产的基础上，规定改善工人的文化物质生活的办法。这就大大加强工人群众的责任心，使工人在生产上发挥最大的积极性与创造性，同时也可以把行政管理部门的工作提高一步。苏联及东北的经验都证实了这种作用。东北某工厂签订集体合同，完成与超过了国家的任务。工人为国家创造了巨大的财富后，自己的文化物质生活也得到改善。许多工厂因而办了工人子弟学校、医务所、业余休养所，修了俱乐部，买了电影机，解决了工人福利问题，鼓舞了群众，使竞赛热情经常饱满。其他如象丰台机务段、广东东莞糖厂，都因为签订了集体合同大大推进了生产运动。集体合同还可以统一工厂企业中党、行政、工会、青年团的步调，集中一切力量，为完成生产计划，改善职工物质文化生活而努力。
    许多厂矿单位的生产计划及定额不精确，工资制度不合理，因此，签订全面的合同，是有某些困难的。但可根据具体情况，将比较有把握的问题，签订合同。经过合同可以推动比较精确的计划的出现，可以制订比较合理的定额，可以贯彻经济核算制度。所以许多行政管理干部不愿签订集体合同的想法是不对的。
    在私营企业里，订立集体合同，更是组织竞赛搞好生产的必要的办法。
    四、根据工厂的生产计划，发动工人群众讨论，制订个人与小组的生产计划，是组织竞赛的基本方法。有了生产计划，就使得每个人有了明确的奋斗目标。这种计划可以成为竞赛的条件，使竞赛的检查有所依据。
    生产计划或是竞赛条件的制订，一般的都应包括完成和超过生产计划多少，产品质量达到什么程度，节省原材料和降低成本多少等内容，并要订出技术学习与保证完成这些条件的办法。东北某工厂的经验是：以生产为中心，以本组的弱点与困难为重点，结合车间的当前任务与具体要求，制订生产计划。只有找出生产上的关键问题，具体灵活地规定每个人、每个组的任务，才不会使计划一般化，或流于形式。小组公约在竞赛中有重大作用，这样既可以展开个人与个人之间的竞赛，也可以发挥集体的创造性。这也就是一方面把国家生产计划具体化，成为每个工人自己的计划，同时，又有小组的集体的自觉的监督作用，以推动车间工作。东北某工厂以小组集体公约运动，作为该厂的经常的竞赛的基本方法，坚持了一年多，迄今仍为组织竞赛保证完成生产任务的有力的形式。因此，订出个人生产计划，再加上小组公约或爱国公约，联系合同或竞赛条约，这就可以把个人、小组、车间之间纵横联系起来，并把直接生产与间接生产的人员，把生产部门与经理部门都组织到竞赛中来。只有这样全盘动起来，才能保持竞赛的经常性。
    五、提倡手脑并用，劳动与技术结合。劳动与技术结合的方法，首先是加强工人群众的技术学习，不断提高技术熟练程度，严格执行技术操作规程与安全规程。其次是加强工人与技术人员的团结，使工人群众的丰富的经验与技术人员的科学知识相结合。再次是开展合理化建议，改进技术，改善劳动组织，提倡发明创造。只有这样，竞赛才能避免单纯体力比赛。许多地区许多工厂都有了这种经验。如沈阳被服一厂姜万寿改进劳动组织的经验被推广后，沈阳市被服业系统的劳动生产率，提高百分之二十五，一九五一年任务可以提前三个月完成。沈阳铁路工厂初鸿义学习科瓦列夫的工作方法，提高工作效率三倍。沈阳化学工厂张义昌原是一个木工，在技术人员帮助下成为化学工人，而且在技术上有所改进，提高了生产效率。因此工会干部必须深入生产过程，研究先进生产者的经验，加以推广。把先进生产者的经验，为每一个工人群众所掌握，这就是实现竞赛的基本原则。只有广大工人群众的技术水平不断提高，把推广先进经验成为指导竞赛的基本方法，才能克服突击现象，逐步向较高级的形式发展。
    六、贯彻公私兼顾、劳资两利的方针。首先要实行合理的工资制度。这是使竞赛从突击到经常的物质保证。但是，我们今天还没有大量推行计件工资制度，现行工资制度还有很多不合理的地方未加调整，这就大大障碍了竞赛的发展。因此，在国家没有正式全面的改革工资制度之前，也需要适当地调整不合理的地方，才能启发工人群众的劳动情绪。其次，应该实行各种精神的与物质的奖励制度，从直接生产人员到辅助生产人员，都应该有一定的奖励办法。根据东北某工厂的经验，要使奖励发生较大的作用，要照章办事，要奖得灵活和及时。其三，是贯彻政府的劳动法令，改进劳动保护工作，经常进行安全卫生检查，制订各种制度、办法，加以贯彻。但许多厂矿单位行政和工会组织对这一问题还未加以应有的注意，常常是竞赛中事故增多，生活住居存在着许多问题，如象伙食不好、厕所不好，都不能即时解决。其实有些问题可以组织工人自己动手解决，是轻而易举的。但因没有及时处理，影响了工人情绪，妨碍竞赛的开展与巩固。沈阳金德江小组组织工人自己动手，协助行政改进劳动条件与生活住居条件，提高了工人的生产情绪，是十分重要的经验。
    七、加强竞赛的领导，党、行政、工会、青年团应思想一致，协同动作。建立与健全对于竞赛的检查制度。采取光荣榜，生产图表，黑板报，广播等方式进行批评表扬，树立经常的鼓动工作。注意培养小组、车间的典型与劳动模范。经常召开劳动模范与先进生产者会议，经常研究与总结经验，并把先进的经验，有计划地普遍地推广出去。只有这样，竞赛才能不断地有新鲜的内容，不断向前发展。
    开展马恒昌小组竞赛运动是把劳动竞赛提高一步的关键。这一运动已经有了相当开展的地区和产业，应当给与参加竞赛的那些先进小组以具体帮助，传播他们的经验，推动本车间、本厂的竞赛运动。尚未开展或开展较少的区域，应集中力量重点培养，吸收经验，把小组竞赛推动起来。小组竞赛搞好了，就可进而搞好一个车间，一个厂的竞赛。为使竞赛稳固地发展，必须加强车间对竞赛的领导，因为车间是生产的基本单位，不能脱离车间的要求，孤立地去搞小组。
