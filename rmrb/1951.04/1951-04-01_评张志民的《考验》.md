　　A Critique of Zhang Zhimin's "The Test"
    Li Keya

　　I recently finished reading Zhang Zhimin's collection of short stories, "The Test" (published by Tianxia Book Company). I believe that one of the stories, "The Test," has serious shortcomings and errors in terms of content and creative method.

　　"The Test" depicts the journey of an intellectual from a petty-bourgeois background who, after joining the revolution, fails to withstand the trials of the environment and ultimately betrays the people and the Party. The author may have intended to use this story to educate certain revolutionary cadres from petty-bourgeois backgrounds, using this character as a warning to help them withstand any test in any environment. But has the author's intention been realized? Let's examine how the author handled this character.

　　The protagonist of the novel, Liu Qingchuan, "joined the anti-Japanese work with anti-Japanese enthusiasm." After studying, he was assigned to a district as an assistant. He was deeply moved by the brave and sacrificial spirit and the hardworking and simple style of the old cadres and Communist Party members in the district, and therefore wanted to become a Communist Party member as well. Finally, he applied to join the Party. On the day he joined the Party, the district party secretary told him: "Communist Party members must withstand tests!" He thought: "In my work today, I will never encounter the kind of situation where the district party secretary was nailed with bamboo skewers or burned with hot iron rods by the enemy. What serious test will I have to face?"

　　But the day of the test eventually came. The county assigned the task of collecting public grain. Liu Qingchuan, the district chief, and the district militiaman Xiao Si were sent to Huangjiazhai to do the collection work. After they arrived at Huangjiazhai, they encountered Japanese invaders looting grain in the village. The district chief stood in front, preparing to cover everyone's escape, but the enemy had already entered the village. Xiao Si was killed, and the district chief was also killed. At this moment, in order to save his own life, Liu Qingchuan betrayed the Party and the people and surrendered to the enemy.

　　After surrendering to the enemy, he not only told the enemy everything, but also led the enemy to surround Huangjiazhai and capture all of our village cadres. The loyal Communist Party member Wei Fuyuan was also buried alive as a result. Later, the Eighth Route Army liberated that area, and Liu Qingchuan actually returned to the revolutionary ranks! How does the novel deal with such a traitor to the Party and the motherland? The author wrote: The leading organs, in order to save him, allowed him to study and reflect, and then assigned him work again.

　　After Japan surrendered, Liu Qingchuan worked in a district of Zhangjiakou. He concealed the truth from the organization, fell in love with a female agent, fell into the trap of a honey trap set by the enemy, and agreed to work for the agent, once again betraying the people.

　　One night, Liu Qingchuan stole the district chief's gun, preparing to give it to the enemy, but because it was dark outside, he fell as soon as he went out, and was discovered by the district chief. At this time, how does the author deal with this traitor to the revolution and the enemy? "In order to save this young man, he was sent to study, hoping that he could still be reformed."

　　Is such lenient treatment of a criminal who has repeatedly betrayed the Party, the motherland, and the people the policy of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government? Of course not. Such treatment is obviously wrong. The author failed to observe and deal with this despicable, degenerate, and selfish character with the correct policy perspective, thus objectively forming a sense of pity, appeasement, and indulgence toward the traitor.

　　Lenin once said that, from a political point of view, no matter what the motive for the act of treason, the harm to the people is the same. The author's inappropriate handling of such a traitor is due to the failure to consider the issue from a political perspective, and therefore the novel erroneously gives repeated lenient treatment to a traitor who has repeatedly betrayed the people.

　　Secondly, the author also departed from individual and accidental phenomena when creating the character, obliterating the educational power of the Party, and making the work lose its authenticity (realism). In the New Democratic Revolution, countless people from petty-bourgeois backgrounds participated in the revolution. After a relatively long period of education by the Party—the education of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought—they generally got rid of their original class positions and were tempered into steel-like fighters. They have played a significant positive role in the revolutionary movement. Why doesn't the author praise these new heroic figures, mainly using their heroic and revolutionary positive factors to educate young people? Why does the author insist on using great effort to unearth individual and accidental phenomena from real life—from the revolutionary ranks—such as selfish, despicable, dirty, and reactionary characters like Liu Qingchuan to depict? Has it achieved the purpose of educating readers as a result?

　　It is obvious that what is written in the novel "The Test" is only an individual phenomenon in the Chinese people's revolution, not the essence of it. Such a creative method of writing about negative characters as the main characters, while failing to deeply expose and criticize them, is obviously wrong. This alone is worth pondering. Today, the Chinese people demand that our writers go deep into life, truly use the creative method of new realism to depict things that generally exist in the struggle, and create a large number of positive character images. Our authors' strength should mainly be placed in this aspect. Therefore, we must change the past preference for writing about negative characters and negative figures (of course, this is not to say that such characters are not allowed to exist in our works). I sincerely hope that our writers will earnestly study theory and policy, analyze reality, and study reality, because only in this way can we grasp the essential and inevitable things in real life for creation, and only then can we grasp the positive factors in real life and create more and better works that are educational to the people, guiding people forward.

### 评张志民的《考验》

　　评张志民的《考验》
    李克亚
    最近我读完了张志民同志的小说集——《考验》（天下图书公司出版）。我认为其中一篇小说《考验》，在内容及创作方法上，有严重的缺点和错误。
    《考验》是描绘一个小资产阶级出身的知识分子参加革命以后，经不起环境的考验，终于背叛了人民，背叛了党的经过。作者也许是企图用这个故事来教育某些小资产阶级出身的革命干部，把这个人物作为借鉴，使他们能够在任何环境里都经得起考验。但作者的企图是否实现了呢？现在让我们看看作者是怎样处理这个人物的。
    小说的主人公刘青川“抱着抗日的热情，参加抗日工作”，经过学习后，分配在一个区里作助理员。他看到区里的老干部和共产党员的勇敢牺牲的精神和艰苦朴素的作风，很是感动，因此也想做一个共产党员。终于他申请入党了。在他入党的那天，区委书记对他说：“共产党员要经得起考验！”他这样想：“在我今天的工作中，决不会碰到像区委书记那样地被敌人钉竹签，烫火锥这种事了，这又有什么严重的关头来考验我呢？”
    可是终究考验的日子来到了。县里布置了一个征收公粮的任务。刘青川和区长、区丁小四等三人被派到黄家寨做征收工作。他们到黄家寨后，正碰到日寇到该村抢粮。区长顶在前面，准备掩护大家冲出去，可是敌人已经进了村。小四牺牲了，区长也牺牲了。这时刘青川为着保全自己的生命，背叛了党，背叛了人民，向敌人投降了。
    他投降敌人后，不但把所有的情况告诉了敌人，而且以后还带领敌人包围黄家寨，把我们的村干部全部捉去。忠心耿耿的共产党员魏福元也因此被活埋了。后来八路军解放了那个地方，刘青川竟又回到革命队伍里来了！小说怎样处理这样一个党和祖国的叛徒呢？作者是这样写的：领导机关为了挽救他的缘故，让他学习和反省，以后又分配他做工作。
    日本投降后，刘青川到张家口某区工作，他隐瞒了组织，爱上一个女特务，坠入敌人所布置的美人计的圈套，答应替特务办事，又一次地叛卖了人民。
    某天夜晚，刘青川把区长的枪偷到手了，准备去送给敌人，但由于外面漆黑，一出门就摔了一交，结果被区长发现。这时，作者又是怎样处理这个革命的叛徒和敌人呢？“为了挽救这个青年，送他去学习，希望他还能改造。”
    对于这样一再叛卖党，叛卖祖国和人民的罪徒的宽大处理，难道是中国共产党和中央人民政府的政策吗？当然不是的。这样的处理显然是错误的。作者没有能以正确的政策观点来观察和处理这个卑鄙、堕落、自私的人物，因之客观上形成对叛徒的怜悯、迁就和姑息。
    列宁曾经说过，从政治意义上说，不论是由于什么动机而发生的叛变行为，其危害人民的效果是一样的。作者对这样一个叛徒处理的不恰当，就是由于没有能从政治上考虑问题，因而小说中对这样一个屡次叛卖人民的叛徒，错误地一再给以宽大的处理。
    其次，作者在创作人物形象时，也是从个别的、偶然的现象出发；抹煞了党的教育力量，使作品失去了真实性（现实性）。在新民主主义革命运动中，无数的出身于小资产阶级的人们参加了革命，他们经过了党较长期的教育——马克思列宁主义，毛泽东思想的教育——一般地说他们都摆脱了原来的阶级立场，锻炼成了钢铁般的战士。他们在革命运动中曾经起了不少的积极作用。作者为什么不歌颂这些新英雄人物，主要以他们的英勇性、革命性的积极因素来教育青年？作者为什么偏要以很大的力量从现实生活中——从革命队伍里发掘出个别的、偶然的现象——像刘青川这样的自私、卑鄙、肮脏、反动的人物来加以描写呢？它是否因此达到了教育读者的目的呢？
    很明显地，《考验》这篇小说里所写的只是中国人民革命当中个别的现象而不是本质的东西。这样把反面人物当作主要人物来写，而又不能深刻地加以揭露、批判的创作方法，显然是错误的。单从这一点也值得引起我们深思。中国人民今天要求我们的作家深入生活，真正用新现实主义的创作方法，去描写在斗争中普遍存在的事物，创造大量的积极人物的形象；我们作者的力量主要应该放在这方面，因此我们必须改变过去那种喜爱写消极人物，反面人物的偏好（当然，这不是说这样的人物就不容许在我们的作品中存在了）。我诚恳地希望我们的作家认真地学习理论政策，分析现实，研究现实，因为只有这样，我们才能抓住现实生活中的本质的、必然性的东西来进行创作，我们才能抓住现实生活中的积极因素，创作出更多的、更好的对人民有教育意义的作品，指导着人们前进。
