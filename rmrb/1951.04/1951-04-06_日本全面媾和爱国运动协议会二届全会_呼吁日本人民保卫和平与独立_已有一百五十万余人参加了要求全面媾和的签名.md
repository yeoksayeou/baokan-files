During their speeches, the representatives pointed out that scientists, cultural workers, Buddhist monks, and Christian pastors in Nagoya, Kyoto, and Nara, as well as workers in Toyama, Kyoto, and Fukuoka, have actively participated in this patriotic movement. The representatives also mentioned examples of joint actions taken by many political parties in Kyoto, Fukuoka, and Oita.

The conference passed a letter to the Japanese people, as well as resolutions protesting the deprivation of Communist Party member Kawakami's rights and protesting the judgments regarding the so-called Mitaka and Matsukawa incidents.

The letter to the Japanese people pointed out that the Potsdam Declaration made the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan possible and enabled the Japanese people to gain independence and liberation. Let everyone unite in the signature campaign demanding a comprehensive peace treaty and opposing armament. The National Comprehensive Peace Patriotic Movement Council National Conference once again appeals to all the people to defend peace and safeguard national independence in the face of the grave threat of a separate treaty that leads to war.

The conference released statistics on the signature campaign demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty and opposing the armament of Japan. A total of 1,503,301 signatures were collected. Local branches of the National Comprehensive Peace Patriotic Movement Council or the organizing committees of these branches have been established in eighteen locations, including Tokyo, Kanagawa, Aichi, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Hiroshima, and Akita.
