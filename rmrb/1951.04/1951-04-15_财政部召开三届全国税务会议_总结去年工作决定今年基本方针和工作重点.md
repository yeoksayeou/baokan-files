　　The Third National Tax Conference convened by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government was held in Beijing from March 20th to April 6th. The conference first discussed and summarized the tax work of 1950. The participants unanimously agreed that the tax work in 1950 was quite successful. These achievements are mainly reflected in the fact that local tax authorities have completed the tax revenue plans stipulated by the Central People's Government and basically implemented the laws and regulations stipulated by the Central People's Government. Therefore, they have played a considerable role in realizing the state financial budget, stabilizing national financial prices, and providing funds for national construction. The reasons for obtaining these achievements are: the Party committees and people's governments at all levels have strengthened their leadership over tax work, the hard work of all tax personnel, and the active fulfillment of tax obligations by the industrial and commercial sectors; at the same time, the popularization and deepening of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and the restoration and development of the urban and rural economy have provided favorable conditions for completing tax tasks.
    The participants believe that, based on the experience of the 1950 tax work, to do a good job in tax work, ensure the completion of tax tasks, and implement the policy of reasonable burden, it is necessary to: 1. Formulate a unified tax law. Last year, due to the Central People's Government's promulgation of various major tax laws, the differences in collection and the imbalance of tax burdens in various regions have been basically eliminated. 2. Party committees and people's governments at all levels attach importance to tax work, and tax cadres strive to complete their work tasks. 3. Rely on workers and shop assistants, unite the industrial and commercial sectors, and eliminate tax evasion. 4. Grasp the key points of taxation. 5. Find out the sources of tax revenue, that is, understand the number of industrial and commercial households in the country, the production and sales volume of various industrial products, the turnover and profit rate of various industries, and study the laws among them.
    Based on the above experience and the national financial and economic work guidelines for 1951, the conference proposed the following basic guidelines and work focus for this year's tax work:
    1. Conduct planned censuses of key tax sources and strengthen tax source control. This requires using considerable force to participate in the re-evaluation of assets of private enterprises in major cities.
    2. Emphasize the implementation of policies and acting in accordance with the law, especially calculating and levying taxes according to rates. At the same time, further simplify tax collection procedures to facilitate the exchange of goods and materials between urban and rural areas.
    3. Continue to require Party committees and people's governments at all levels to attach importance to tax work, adjust the strength of cadres in a focused manner, and rectify organizations and train cadres in a planned manner to improve the business and policy level of tax cadres. At the same time, continue to rely on workers and shop assistants, unite the industrial and commercial sectors to fulfill patriotic conventions, and block tax evasion.
    The participants unanimously agreed that doing the above work well is the main prerequisite for completing the tax tasks for 1951.
    The conference also discussed the draft tax laws for the upcoming temporary commercial tax, peddler tax, and transaction tax, as well as the taxation issues of cooperatives. In order to further balance the burden and take care of the exchange of goods and materials between urban and rural areas, the conference made necessary revisions to the above draft tax laws. In addition, the conference focused on discussing organizational leadership issues and several specific issues related to the collection of industrial and commercial taxes and goods taxes.
    The participants believe that although the tax work last year has achieved great results, all tax personnel must not be complacent about this. Because the financial and economic tasks for 1951 are more arduous and heavy, this requires all tax personnel, under the leadership of Party committees and people's governments at all levels, to further unite the industrial and commercial sectors, rely on workers and shop assistants, and mobilize the broad masses of the people to strive for greater victories in tax work.

　　财政部召开三届全国税务会议
    总结去年工作决定今年基本方针和工作重点
    中央人民政府财政部召开的第三届全国税务会议于三月二十日到四月六日在北京举行。会议首先讨论并总结了一九五○年的税务工作。与会者一致认为，一九五○年的税务工作是有相当成绩的。这些成绩主要表现在各地税务机关都完成了中央人民政府规定的税收计划，基本上贯彻了中央人民政府规定的法令和制度，因而在实现国家财政概算，稳定全国金融物价，提供国家建设资金等方面都起了相当的作用。获得这些成绩的原因是：各级中共党委和人民政府加强了对税收工作的领导，全体税务人员的艰苦努力和工商界的积极履行纳税义务；同时，抗美援朝运动的普及和深入，城乡经济的恢复和发展，都为完成税收任务提供了良好的条件。
    与会者认为，根据一九五○年税务工作的经验，要作好税务工作，保证完成税收任务和贯彻执行合理负担政策，必须：一、制订统一的税法。去年由于中央人民政府颁布了各种主要税法，各地征收上的纷歧和税负不平衡现象已基本上消灭了。二、各地中共党委和人民政府重视税收工作和税收干部努力完成工作任务。三、依靠职工店员，团结工商界，肃清偷漏现象。四、掌握税收重点。五、摸清税源，即了解全国工商业的户数、各种工业品的产销量、各种行业的营业额和利润率，并研究其中的规律。
    会上根据上述经验和一九五一年全国财经工作方针，提出了本年度税务工作的基本方针和工作重点如下：
    一、有计划地进行重点税源的普查，加强税源控制。这就必须使用相当的力量参加主要城市中私营企业的重估资产工作。
    二、强调贯彻政策，依法办事，特别是依率计征。同时要进一步简化稽征手续，便利城乡物资交流。
    三、继续要求各级中共党委和人民政府重视税收工作，有重点地调整干部力量，和有计划地整顿组织，训练干部，以便提高税收干部的业务和政策水平。同时要继续依靠职工店员，团结工商界履行爱国公约，堵塞偷漏。
    与会者一致同意，做好上述工作，是完成一九五一年税收任务的主要前提。
    会议也讨论了即将颁发的临时商业税、摊贩业税、交易税的税法草案和合作社的纳税问题。为了进一步平衡负担，照顾城乡物资交流，会议上对上述税法草案作了必要的修正。此外，会议并着重讨论了组织领导问题和有关工商、货物各税征收中的几个具体问题。
    与会者认为：去年的税收工作成绩虽然很大，但全体税务人员决不可因此有自满情绪。因为一九五一年的财经工作任务更加艰巨和繁重，这便要全体税务人员在各级中共党委和人民政府的领导下，进一步团结工商界，依靠职工店员，并动员广大人民来争取税收工作的更大胜利。
