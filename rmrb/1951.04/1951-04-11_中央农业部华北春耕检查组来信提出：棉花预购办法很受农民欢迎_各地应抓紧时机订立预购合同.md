Central Ministry of Agriculture North China Spring Planting Inspection Team Writes:
　　Cotton Pre-Purchase Method Very Popular with Farmers, All Regions Should Seize the Opportunity to Establish Pre-Purchase Contracts
To the Editor:

　　We recently publicized the cotton pre-purchase agreement method stipulated by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and the Central Trade Department to farmers in the third district of Jin County, Hebei Province. The farmers welcomed this very much. In Dongzhuosu Village, we invited nine cooperative members for a discussion. Eight members were willing to sign this pre-purchase contract. The Communist Party branch secretary of Yinjiagzhuang reflected: The village originally planned to plant 1,674 mu of cotton. After two mobilizations, it was still short by more than 100 mu. According to the pre-purchase method, if some grain could be advanced to solve the food shortage for some people, the cotton planting plan could be completed. Some farmers in Beipengtou Village were preparing to plant some "spring corn" due to insufficient spring grain. Now that they heard that they could get corn in advance by signing a contract, they all changed to planting cotton. Director Wang of the Dongzhuosu United Village Cooperative proposed: Our cooperative has more than 4,000 members, most of whom are willing to sign pre-purchase contracts. Members generally prefer Northeast corn, but it would be even better if soybean cake could be used to pre-purchase cotton. It is estimated that the cooperative can develop many more members by signing cotton pre-purchase contracts. We believe that if North China can widely sign cotton pre-purchase contracts before cotton sowing, the cotton planting plan will not only be completed as planned but is likely to exceed the target.
　　The sowing season has arrived. We hope that cooperatives and trade departments in various regions will seize the opportunity to sign cotton pre-purchase contracts with farmers.

Editor's Note: The cotton pre-purchase contract is a positive and good method for expanding cotton production and ensuring national needs. All regions should seize the season and do a good job in this work. The signing of contracts must be based on voluntary mutual benefit. The method should be that the district and village cooperatives first sign contracts with production teams or individual farmers based on actual conditions, and then sign contracts level by level upwards. In this regard, it is necessary to prevent administrative orders or the phenomenon of assigning tasks. To ensure the implementation of the contract, inspections should be carried out in a planned way, and the masses should be mobilized to supervise each other. It is necessary to prevent the funds and grain prepaid in the contract from being misappropriated or issued as relief funds.

### 中央农业部华北春耕检查组来信提出：棉花预购办法很受农民欢迎  各地应抓紧时机订立预购合同

　　中央农业部华北春耕检查组来信提出：
　　棉花预购办法很受农民欢迎  各地应抓紧时机订立预购合同
    编辑同志：
    我们最近在河北省晋县三区，将全国合作总社和中央贸易部规定的棉花预购协议办法，向农民进行宣传，农民对此非常欢迎。在东卓宿村，我们邀请了九名合作社员，举行座谈。有八个社员愿意订这种预购合同。尹家庄中共支部书记反映：该村原计划种一六七四亩棉花，经两次动员，尚差一百多亩，根据预购的办法，如果能先支给一部分粮食，解决了某些人的吃粮困难，植棉计划就能完成。北彭头村某些农民因春粮不足，都准备种一些“春玉米”，现在听说订合同能先支给玉米，便全改种棉花了。东卓宿联村合作社王主任提出：我们合作社有四千多名社员，大部分都愿意订预购合同。社员一般都喜欢东北玉米，但如能以豆饼来预购棉花，就更好。估计该村合作社通过订立棉花预购合同，还可发展很多社员。我们相信，如果华北地区能在棉花播种前，广泛订立棉花预购合同，植棉计划不仅会如数完成，还很可能超过。
    播种时节已到，希望各地合作社和贸易部门抓紧时机，和农民订立棉花的预购合同。
　　          中央农业部华北春耕检查组
    编者按：棉花预购合同对扩大棉产，保证全国需要，是一个积极的好办法。各地应该抓紧时节搞好这一工作。订合同必须建立在自愿两利的基础上。其方法应该是先由区、村合作社根据实际情况，和生产小组或个别农民订约，然后逐级上订。对此，要防止行政命令或摊派任务的现象。为了保证合同的实现，应该有计划地进行检查，发动群众互相监督，应防止把合同预支的款项和粮食胡乱挪用，或当作救济粮款发出。
