Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

To the Editor:

　　We have read the article "Xiangjiang Coal Mine Leaders Do Not Rely on Workers, Competition Fails to Take Off and Accidents Increase" by Ya Wu published in the "Reader's Letters" section of your newspaper on March 14th. After reading it, we immediately examined our own work. We feel that while some of Ya Wu's criticisms are correct, many are inaccurate. We would like to clarify point by point as follows:

　　In the initial stages of the competition at Xiangjiang Coal Mine, due to a lack of experience, coordination in various aspects was insufficient; in particular, publicity and mobilization efforts were not timely enough, which affected the rapid deployment of the competition. After numerous discussions, preliminary improvements have been made. The production competition was enthusiastically launched as early as February 16th. Electromechanical workers did not rest during the Spring Festival, taking advantage of the shutdown period to conduct major overhauls of the wellhead, tunnels, and machinery, which increased the safety guarantee for the production competition. After the start of the second section of the well work team's competition, output increased month by month. In the past, the average ash content of coal was over 25 percent; now, the ash content has been reduced to about 20 percent. Workers have established a shift handover system and consciously abide by labor discipline, which has greatly improved order underground. Since the start of the competition, work-related injuries have significantly decreased, and there have been no fatalities. Workers in the washing and refining section have adjusted the labor organization, increasing the washing and refining volume from 260 tons per day to 400 tons; after establishing a production chart system, workers' morale has been further boosted. Other workshops are also in the process of developing production competition plans. Ya Wu did not mention any of these facts.

　　Comrade Ya Wu said, "How to carry out the competition was never discussed with the workers, but rather a few administrative leaders wrote a plan and reported it to the higher authorities." This is not the case. At the beginning of the competition, we organized workers' discussions and widely solicited opinions from the masses. The management committee and the trade union also held several meetings for discussion, all of which have meeting records available for verification.

　　He also said, "The writing group wrote dozens of slogans, and only one was posted in the carpentry workshop yard: 'Do not wear oily shoes or wooden clogs underground'; the rest of the slogans were also command-like, how can they improve workers' production morale?" In fact, there were more than dozens of slogans, all of which were created by the slogan and cartoon group of the propaganda and mobilization committee. We feel that it is necessary to post slogans like "Do not wear oily shoes or wooden clogs underground" in the carpentry workshop yard. Because not only well work team workers go down the mine, but also civil engineering and electromechanical workers often go down for maintenance, and in the past, it was often found that people were wearing oily shoes and wooden clogs underground. Since the slogans were posted, no one has worn oily shoes or wooden clogs underground.

　　As for saying, "The blackboard newspaper does not mention the competition, but on the February 18th blackboard newspaper was posted a confession of gambling workers." Comrade Ya Wu's way of raising the issue is one-sided. Our blackboard newspaper revolves around the central work, reflecting the production situation and life dynamics of the workers. In the competition movement, of course, the competition is the main focus; but this does not mean that other things are not allowed to be published at all. Since the launch of the competition, the blackboard newspaper has published a lot of news about production, and there are drafts available for verification. The workers are particularly interested in the blackboard newspaper, and their enthusiasm for writing articles is very high. The eighteen blackboards are currently not enough. Articles on production competition are extremely crowded.

　　After the establishment of the mine management committee last year, workers raised many opinions on production and even life. After careful study, we adopted and implemented most of them; we also explained to the workers those that could not be implemented. Today, workers are putting forward more correct opinions, which we believe is a favorable condition for Xiangjiang Coal Mine and a good guarantee for running the mine well. We believe that Comrade Ya Wu's approach of reflecting problems without investigation and research and without a spirit of seeking truth from facts is not good.

　　Editor's note: The publication of reader Ya Wu's unrealistic criticism of Xiangjiang Coal Mine in this newspaper on March 14th was an undesirable oversight. From the letter from Guo Yongfeng, Deputy Manager of Xiangjiang Coal Mine Company, etc., it can be seen that although there were some shortcomings in the production competition at Xiangjiang Coal Mine in the past, Ya Wu did not adopt a realistic, well-intentioned, and constructive criticism of these shortcomings; instead, he unilaterally exaggerated the shortcomings and even completely distorted the facts, which is not right.

### 湘江煤矿公司对不正确批评提出意见

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　湘江煤矿公司对不正确批评提出意见编辑同志：
    贵报三月十四日《读者来信专页》刊登亚屋写的《湘江煤矿领导干部不依靠工人，竞赛搞不起来事故却增加了》一稿。我们看后即结合自己的工作做了检查。我们觉得亚屋的批评虽然有一部分是正确的，但失实之处颇多。现逐项说明如下：
    湘江煤矿在竞赛初期，由于缺乏经验，各方面配合得很不够；尤其是宣传鼓动工作搞得不及时，影响竞赛不能迅速展开。经过大家多次研究，已有初步改进。生产竞赛早在二月十六日热烈地展开了。机电工人春节不休息，趁停工时期进行了井口、井巷、机械大检修，增加了生产竞赛安全的保障。井工股第二段竞赛开始后，产量逐月增加。过去煤质灰份平均在百分之二十五以上，现在煤质灰分降低到百分之二十左右。工人建立交接班制度，自觉地遵守劳动纪律，使井下秩序大大改进。竞赛开始至今，公伤事故显著减少，更未发生死亡事故。洗炼股工人调整劳动组织，使洗炼量由以往每天二百六十吨提高到四百吨；建立生产图表制度后，工人情绪更加高涨。其他各车间也正在订生产竞赛计划。对于这些事实，亚屋同志却只字未提。
    亚屋同志说：“竞赛如何搞，根本未发动工人讨论，只是由少数行政领导干部写了计划报告上级。”事实不是这样。竞赛开始时，我们便组织工人讨论，广泛征求群众意见。管理委员会及工会也曾数度开会讨论，均有会议纪录可查。
    他又说：“文书股写了几十条标语，在木工场院子里贴了一张，‘不要穿着油鞋、木屐下井’；其余的标语也是一条条命令式的，怎么能提高工人的生产情绪。”实际上标语不止几十条，都是宣传鼓动委员会标语漫画组搞的。在木工场院子里贴“不要穿着油鞋、木屐下井”这样的标语，我们觉得是必要的。因为矿山不仅井工股工人下井，土木股与机电股的工人也时常下井检修，并且过去时常发现有穿着油鞋、木屐下井的。自从贴了标语后，现在的确没有人穿油鞋、木屐下井了。
    至于说：“黑板报也不提竞赛的事，在二月十八日的黑板报上登的是赌博工人的悔过书。”亚屋同志这样提问题是片面的。我们的黑板报是围绕着中心工作，反映工人的生产情况与生活动态的。在竞赛运动中，当然是以竞赛为主；但这并不是说其他的东西根本不许登。竞赛开展以来，黑板报刊登了许多关于生产的消息，是有底稿可查的。工人们对黑板报特别感兴趣，写稿子的情绪很高，十八块黑板目前已不敷应用。生产竞赛方面的稿件，异常拥挤。
    去年本矿管理委员会成立后，工人们对生产上以至生活上提出很多意见，我们经过慎密的研究，大部分采纳实行了；一部分不能实行的，也都向工人做了解释。到今天，工人中提出的正确意见更多了，我们觉得这是湘江煤矿的有利条件，是搞好矿山的良好保证。我们认为亚屋同志这种不经过调查研究，不以实事求是的精神来反映问题，是不好的。
          湘江煤矿公司副经理郭永丰、温德、刘柏庵
            工会主席  傅达聪                  
    编者按：三月十四日本报刊登读者亚屋对湘江煤矿的不切合事实的批评，这是一个不应有的疏忽，从湘江煤矿公司副经理郭永丰等的来信中看：湘江煤矿过去在生产竞赛上虽然存在着一些缺点，但亚屋对于这些缺点不是采取实事求是的、与人为善的、建设性的批评；而是片面地夸大了缺点，甚至完全歪曲了事实，这是不应该的。
