Xinhua News Agency, Second Dispatch: The China People's Resist America, Aid Korea Headquarters Issues Notice

Regarding how to respond to the resolutions of the World Peace Council and the issue of popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement nationwide, this headquarters has already made clear provisions in the circular issued on March 14th. In order to execute this major political task, it is necessary to universally establish Resist America, Aid Korea branches in all localities. Therefore, the following provisions are specifically made:

(1) All cities and counties above the county level should establish Resist America, Aid Korea branches, so that everyone in every place in the country can participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.

(2) The leading bodies of local branches should absorb representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and other patriotic democratic figures. Only in this way can the organization of this headquarters have full representation and mass character, and can it smoothly mobilize all the people to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.

(3) Provincial, municipal, and administrative region-level branches may, based on the principle of streamlining, set up a number of full-time and part-time staff according to work needs. At the county level, appropriate cadres may be recommended by various people's organizations or propaganda and education departments to concurrently serve and regularly preside over the work.

(4) After the establishment of local branches, it is hoped that a report will be written to us through the superior branch.

    【新华社二日讯】中国人民抗美援朝总会通知
    关于如何响应世界和平理事会的决议及在全国普及与深入抗美援朝运动问题，本会已于三月十四日所发通告中作了明确的规定。为执行这一重大的政治任务，各地抗美援朝分会有普遍建立之必要。因此特作如下的规定：
    （一）所有市和县以上各级均应建立抗美援朝分会，以便使全国每一处每一人都能参加抗美援朝运动。
    （二）各地分会领导机构中应吸收各民主党派、各人民团体及其他各方面的爱国民主人士的代表人物参加。这样才能使本会的组织具有充分的代表性和群众性，才能顺利地动员全体人民，普及与深入抗美援朝运动。
    （三）省、市和行政区以上分会，可根据精简原则，按工作上的需要，设置若干专职与兼职工作人员。县一级可由各人民团体或宣传教育部门内推出适当干部兼任，并经常主持其工作。
    （四）各地分会成立后，望一律经过上级分会写一报告给我们。
