　　The Ma Hengchang Team Completes Production Task Ahead of Schedule in March
    Once Again Realizing Challenge Conditions to Workers Nationwide
    Quality Qualification Rate of Precision Products Reaches 100 Percent
    The Ma Hengchang team realized once again in March the challenge conditions put forward to workers nationwide.
    The team modified three types of tools in March. With the help of technical personnel, four technicians in the team initially learned the "high-speed cutting method" and created four new records for shortening working hours. Among them, Tong Junshan used the "high-speed cutting method" to machine a grooved wheel, shortening the time required from 14 hours in the past to 1 hour and 50 minutes. The relationship between masters and apprentices within the team became closer. All nine apprentices in the team have been able to work on lathes with the help of their masters, and some can even do more difficult work. At the beginning of March, the team held a complaint meeting and a discussion meeting, accusing the Japanese invaders of their atrocities. They also conducted criticism and self-criticism at the meeting, reviewed the reasons for the 0.6 percent scrap rate in February, and proposed improvement measures. As a result, the quality qualification rate of the 638 precision products made by the team in March reached 100 percent, and the monthly production task was completed four days and seven hours ahead of schedule. The attendance rate also remained at 100 percent, as in the first two months. In addition, in response to the call from the administrative side to ensure the completion of the factory's first-quarter production task, the team selected two technicians to help in other departments of the factory for seven days, repaired 13 defective products for other teams, and proposed 10 rationalization proposals. By mid-March, the factory had completed its first-quarter task 15 days ahead of schedule.
    After summarizing its work in March, the Ma Hengchang team decided that in April, in addition to actively realizing the three goals set at the end of February before the "May 1st" Labor Day (the whole team, except for apprentices, will learn the "high-speed cutting method"; eliminate illiteracy; all apprentices in the team will improve their technical level by one grade), they also proposed to do two more things: (1) Respond to the call of the Northeast People's Government Industry Department and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, do a good job in the spring security inspection, select special personnel from the team to be responsible for inspecting technical operating procedures, ensure the safety of machines and personnel; formulate a system for regularly maintaining environmental hygiene and personal hygiene, and ensure the healthy production of workers. (2) Continue to strengthen unity with technical personnel and strengthen technical learning, and invite technical personnel to give lectures on the principles of "high-speed cutting method" and technical theory once a week.

　　马恒昌小组三月份提前完成生产任务
    再度实现向全国工人挑战条件
    所做精密产品质量合格率达百分之百
    马恒昌小组三月份又实现了向全国工人提出的挑战条件。
    该组在三月份中改造了三种工具。在技术人员的帮助下，组内有四名技工初步学会了“高速切削法”创造了四项缩短工时的新纪录。其中佟俊山试用“高速切削法”车一个槽轮，由过去需要十四小时缩短为一小时五十分。组内师徒关系更加密切。全组九名徒工在师傅帮助下都已上车床做活，有的且能做比较难做的活。三月初，该组召开了诉苦会和座谈会，控诉日寇暴行。他们并在会上展开批评与自我批评，检讨了二月份存在百分之零点六废品率的原因，并提出了改进办法。结果，三月份全组所做六百三十八件精密产品的质量合格率已达到百分之百，并提前四天零七小时完成了全月生产任务，出勤率也和头两个月一样保持了百分之百。此外，该组还响应行政方面提出的保证完成全厂第一季度生产任务的号召，推选二名技工到该厂其他部门帮工七天，又为别组修理废品十三件，提出合理化建议十件。在三月中旬，该厂已提前十五天完成了首季任务。
    马恒昌小组在总结三月份工作后，决定四月份除积极实现二月底订出的“五一”节前的三项奋斗目标（除了徒工，全组学会“高速切削法”；消灭文盲；全组徒工技术提高一级）外，并提出还要做好两件事：（一）响应东北人民政府工业部和东北总工会的号召，做好春季保安检查工作，由组内选出专人负责检查技术操作规程，保证机器和人身的安全；订出经常保持环境卫生和身体卫生的制度，保证工人健康生产。（二）继续加强团结技术人员和加强技术学习，每周请技术人员讲“高速切削法”原理、技术理论各一次。（新华社）
