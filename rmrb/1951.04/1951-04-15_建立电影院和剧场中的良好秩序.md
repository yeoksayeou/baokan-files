　　Establishing Good Order in Cinemas and Theaters

　　To the Editor:

　　The quality of order in cinemas and theaters is a crucial factor in determining whether the audience can effectively absorb the content of plays and movies. If, in the past, going to the theater was simply for casual amusement and fun, now many viewers understand that "watching plays and movies is like attending night school, for the purpose of gaining knowledge and broadening the mind." Therefore, theater management has become an important task today that cannot be taken lightly. We should not only actively improve the theater's facilities (such as lounges, tea rooms, and other ventilation and sanitary facilities), but also constantly educate the audience and promote the necessity of maintaining public order. Public opinion should also constantly monitor and stop phenomena that disrupt theater order. In my opinion, doing so is an indispensable part of improving the cultural level of the masses. Especially in the capital, we should strive to achieve this and set a good example of public order for the whole country. For example, the "Star Cinema" in Dongsi Pailou, whose theater conditions and order have always been poor, has recently been making efforts to promote "Please smoke in the lounge," "Do not smoke in the theater to avoid affecting the light," etc., which is undoubtedly a good sign.

　　In recent instances, I think the most worthy of improvement is that audiences often leave their seats before the play ends or the words "The End" appear on the screen. Those waiting to see the end are blocked by the people standing in front of them; some viewers even block the lens with their heads, creating a large black patch on the screen! Even public cinemas like "Dahua" turn a blind eye to this phenomenon.

　　Even before the film is finished, the exit doors are opened wide, light shines in from outside, and the curtain is already drawn in front of the screen, with the final few scenes of the film projected onto the curtain!

　　There are naturally reasons why the audience wants to leave before the play is over. First, many cinemas currently only have one exit door (one upstairs and one downstairs), and some people are afraid of the crowds at the exit, so they leave early to hire a car or catch a bus; another reason is that many plays currently start with suffering, followed by liberation, and then struggle—ending. And the endings are often perfunctory, with largely the same approach. Therefore, many viewers watch the beginning tensely, happily see liberation, and then feel there is nothing more to see, so they want to leave. Overcoming the first point naturally requires further improvements in theater construction (currently, "Dahua" and "Capital" have separated the audience's entrance and exit routes); overcoming the second point also depends on a more in-depth approach to the content of the plays and overcoming formulaic methods of presentation, but even if these are achieved, it still cannot guarantee that the audience will not leave their seats before the end, because this indeed involves the audience's views and habits regarding public order, as well as the theater's education of the audience.

　　The audience should understand that the beginning and end of a play or a movie, like an article, have been carefully considered by the author. Not every play or movie ends with a struggle. For example, "The White-Haired Girl" does not end after the struggle meeting; there is also a scene at the end where Xi'er and Dachun work together in production—this is something that the author and director put thought into, not just a casual ending. Another example is "The Russian Question." The main character, Smith, has an important speech at the end of the play (on stage, it is to a visiting interviewer; in the movie, it is in the square). Every word and sentence is very meaningful. If everyone is making noise and cannot hear clearly, it is like only seeing part of the play, or even missing a very important part.

　　In order to establish good theater-going habits among the audience, I propose that the point of not being able to leave one's seat casually before the end of the performance should be promoted and educated as a theater-going rule among the audience (using slides, it can be noted in the program, or like other theater rules. It should also be proposed to the audience). The practice of the Beijing People's Art Theater of only allowing latecomers to enter after a performance is finished during musical evenings is correct. Cinemas should educate their management personnel and correct the habit of opening doors and windows and drawing the curtain before the performance is over.

　　Finally, there is the issue of playing music records in the theater.

　　Recently, several large theaters have mostly played foreign songs before the start of the movie, and Chinese music is rarely heard; upon entering the theater, it feels as if one is already abroad. This trend is also unhealthy. There are already many newly recorded Chinese records, and there are also many good instrumental pieces among the old records. Why must the emphasis be on playing foreign music? Chinese cinemas and theaters should play more Chinese songs, and currently, they should also play more songs about resisting America and aiding Korea.

### 建立电影院和剧场中的良好秩序

专栏：读者来信
 　 建立电影院和剧场中的良好秩序编辑同志：
    电影院和剧场秩序的好坏，是决定观众能否很好地接受戏剧、电影内容的重要条件之一。如果说过去进剧场只是为了随便玩玩，开开心，那么，现在许多观众都懂得，“看戏、看电影，也好像上夜校一样，是为了长知识、开脑筋的”。因之剧场管理在今天变成了一件不可轻视的工作。我们不仅应该积极改善剧场的设备条件（如休息室、饮茶室以及其他通风等卫生设备等），同时应该随时教育观众，向观众宣传维持公共秩序的必要性。群众舆论也应该随时监督和制止那些破坏剧场秩序的现象。这样作，在我看来是提高群众文化水平中一个不可缺少的东西。尤其是在首都，我们应该努力作到这点，为全国树立起良好的公共秩序的模范。如东四牌楼的“明星电影院”，剧场条件和秩序一向都较差，但它最近也在努力宣传“吸烟请到休息室”，“勿在场内吸烟，以免影响光线”等，这无疑是很好的现象。
    在最近的事例中，我觉得最值得改进的是观众往往不等散戏或银幕上映出“剧终”、“完”等字样时，便纷纷离座。那些等着看完的人，却被前面站起来的人遮住了视线；有的观众竟使脑袋挡住了镜头，在银幕映出黑黑的一大片！即使象“大华”这样的公营电影院，也对此种现象熟视无睹。
    甚至，影片还没映完，散场门便已大开，光线从门外照了进来，并且银幕前面已经拉上幕帷，影片在最终的几个画面，是映在幕帷上的！
    观众不等戏完便要走，这自然也有原因。第一是目前许多影院只有一个散场门（楼上下各一），有的人惟恐散场时拥挤，便提前动身，以便雇车或搭车；另一个原因便是目前有好多戏，先是痛苦，后是解放，接着便是斗争——完结。而且后面每每草草从事，手法大体雷同。所以许多观众紧张地看完了前面，高兴地看到解放，再以后，便觉得没有什么可看的了，因此想走。克服第一点，在剧场建设上自然还需要继续作一些改进（目前如“大华”、“首都”，已将观众入场出场分道处理）；克服第二点，也有待于在剧作内容上的更加深入，与克服表现方法上的公式主义，但是即使作到这些也仍不能保证观众不致在散戏前随便离座，因这中间确实包含着一个观众对公共秩序的看法与习惯，以及剧场对观众的教育问题。
    应该使观众懂得：一场戏或是一个电影，它的开头和结尾，好像一篇文章一样，都是经过作者细心思考过的。不见得每个戏每个电影都是一斗争便完结。比如《白毛女》，也并不是开过斗争会便完了，最后还有喜儿和大春一块生产的镜头——这一点，乃是作者和导演费过心思处理的，并不是一个随便的收场。又比如《俄罗斯问题》，剧中主人斯密司在结尾时有一段很重要的讲话（舞台剧是对一位访员，电影是在广场上），每字每句都很有意思，如果大家哄哄闹嚷听不清楚，这便等于只看了这个戏的一部分，甚至漏掉了很重要的一部分。
    为了在观众中建立起良好的看戏习惯，我提议应把不散场时不能随便离座这一点，当做一种看戏的规矩在观众中进行宣传教育（用幻灯片即可，演戏可以注在说明书上，或和其他的剧场规则一样。同时向观众提出）。北京人民艺术剧院在举行音乐晚会时，迟到的观众必须等一个节目表演完毕时方准入场的作法是对的。电影院应该对管理人员进行教育，不等演完即打开门窗和拉上幕帷的习惯，必须加以纠正。
    最后，还有一个在剧场中放送音乐唱片的问题。
    近来有几家大的剧场，在电影开演前大半是放送外国歌曲，中国音乐却很少听见；一进剧场，仿佛已置身国外。这种风气也是不健康的，中国新灌的唱片已很多，旧唱片中也不乏好的器乐曲子，为什么一定要偏重于放送外国音乐呢？中国的影剧院，应该多放中国歌曲，在目前，还应该多放抗美援朝的歌曲。
