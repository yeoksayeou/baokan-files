　　Why I Firmly Demand the Government Severely Suppress Counter-revolutionaries?
　　Xu Yingchao, Director of the Physical Education Department, Beijing Normal University

　　I have been working in the education field since 1919, and I have been teaching at Beijing Normal University since 1926. Everyone who knows me well knows that I am honest and conscientious. However, under the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, this kind of behavior was not allowed, so I was almost killed by secret agents.

　　In 1948, the "April 9th" bloodbath occurred at Beijing Normal University. Secret agents broke into the school in the middle of the night, fired shots to intimidate, smashed classrooms, injured students, and kidnapped students. When I went to the student dormitory, I saw blood all over the beds and bedding, and blood all over the floor. One streak of blood flowed all the way from the steps to the bottom. I couldn't contain my grief and indignation, so I proposed convening a professors' meeting to support the students; and mobilized all the professors to see the students' blood stains; and went to the bandit leader Li Zongren's headquarters to demand the release of the arrested students. Unexpectedly, this was the main reason why I was persecuted by secret agents. At that time, some students in the Physical Education Department of Beijing Normal University acted recklessly in the school, did not attend classes properly, and often fought. I often advised them, but little did I know that they were secret agents and Sanqing Tuan (Three Youth Principles League) thugs, who actually said that I was oppressing patriotic youth, which was also the reason for my persecution.

　　On the night of December 23, 1948, more than twenty secret agents entered the teachers' dormitory from the roof and surrounded the dormitory. More than a dozen secret agents broke into my room under the pretext of checking household registration, pointing several guns at me and forbidding me to move. My young children were also watched by them with guns. They opened all the boxes and all the drawers, and rummaged through all the things, throwing them all over the room and on the floor. Finally, they took me to the Zhongyu Restaurant in Shefan Temple, Xidan Archway, and interrogated me in a small room, saying that I incited student unrest and oppressed patriotic youth, saying that I was the secretary of the Beijing Democratic League, saying that there was my name on a printed matter, and asking me for the list of the Democratic League and the radio station. In fact, I have nothing to do with the Democratic League. I have been working in the education field for thirty years, and I don't know a single comrade of the Democratic League, so where would I get a list? Where would there be a radio station? I said it was fabricated. I reasoned with them, but little did I know that secret agents are inhuman things, so what is there to reason with! Without saying a word, they started torturing me. Six or seven people came up, pressed me to the ground, made me kneel, stuffed my mouth with a towel, put a large lever on my calves, two people held my arms, and one grabbed my hair and pulled it back, making my upper body lean back, bending me to the ground. Four people stood on the lever, pressing down hard, scolding and pressing. At that time, I felt my legs aching as if they were about to crack, as if they were about to burst. After pressing like this for more than half an hour, I passed out. When I came back to life, they still wanted the list and the radio station. I clearly didn't have them. So they pressed again. They pressed me to death three times like this, and pointed at my face, scolded me, and hit my face, making my mouth bleed. When I saw their ferocious appearance, they looked like a group of evil ghosts. Later, they thought that pressing with a lever was not enough, so they changed another kind of torture. They tied me up with a rope, from shoulder to foot, tied dozens of times, and then laid me face up on a table, with my head hanging outside the table. One person grabbed my hair and pulled my head down, four people pressed my arms and legs, and another person sat on my stomach. At this time, I couldn't move at all. Another person folded a towel, covered my nose and mouth, and poured cold water from a pot, pouring water into both my nose and mouth, choking me so I couldn't breathe. I felt like I was going to suffocate, and I desperately struggled; but I couldn't move at all. I was watered to death three times like this. Even now, whenever I think about it, I have to take a deep breath. If I think about it at night, I have to sit up and take a deep breath.

　　Later, they took me to the First Substation of the Second Branch Bureau in Fuyou Street and threw me into a large empty room. This room had no door, and many windows were also broken. At that time, it was the coldest time of winter. In such a room, without a stove, without bedding, I lay on the ground. My legs were numb for four days, and after four days I felt pain, and the pain became more and more severe, as if they were about to burst.

　　Later, they dragged me out for interrogation again. The person who interrogated me this time was the most ferocious one. His nickname was "Human Cook," meaning that he killed people casually. He didn't think it was a big deal to kill people, just like a cook killing chickens. He told me to tell him all the members of the Democratic League and hand over the radio station. I clearly didn't know a single member of the Democratic League, so where would I get a list and a radio station? He shouted ferociously, "Torture him!" Then a group of people came up, tied my hands behind my back with hemp rope, kicked me while tying, tying it very tightly, breaking the skin. Then they hung me upside down with my hands tied behind my back from the beam of the house. After I was hung up, two soldiers stood on both sides, taking turns kicking my waist with their feet, causing me to swing back and forth in the air; and slapping my face, making my mouth bleed. They hung me like this for more than an hour. This wasn't enough. They tore off my clothes, burned a half-foot-long iron rod red in the stove, and scalded me, making sizzling sounds and smoke, scalding dozens of places on my body. I gnashed my teeth and hated them. Finally, I felt that I was going to die. I only said one sentence: "What kind of person am I, Xu Yingchao, to die here like this!" After saying this, I fainted.

　　After that, they threw me back into that broken room. I lay half-dead on a mat, and vaguely heard the wind blowing outside. It seemed that it was already dark, and the lights in the room seemed to be half on and half off. There were two people in black clothes holding guns. At this time, my two legs were unable to move because they were pressed by the lever, and my two arms were unable to move because they were hung up. My two hands had lost consciousness because they were tied up. The skin on my wrists was torn off by the rope, and my hands were covered with blood, swollen and not looking like human hands. My whole body was scalded. I lay there in a daze. At that time, I thought: Aren't university professors usually respected? Shouldn't they uphold justice in society? Shouldn't they lead and care for young people? Now, I am suffering such cruel torture! Suffering such humiliation! This group of inhuman things! If I don't die, I must avenge this! I also thought, I am bound to die. Is this the result of my hating evil like an enemy and never compromising? Thinking this, I felt infinite grief and indignation!

　　After a few days, because they couldn't get anything out of me, they changed to a method of pretending to be kind. A secret agent leader came to talk to me, advising me to confess, saying that if I confessed, I could avoid death and be treated favorably, and asked me to write a self-criticism. What did I have to confess? So I wrote a self-criticism as follows:

　　"I have been engaged in education for thirty years, and I am honest and faithful, and I work hard and conscientiously. I am strict with students' studies at the Normal University; but I love young people. In the 'April 9th' incident, students were injured, and I couldn't control my emotions, so I made statements sympathizing with the students. I expressed dissatisfaction with the 'government,' but I have not committed any illegal actions. It is not right to consider it as ironclad evidence of a capital crime simply because my name is written on a printed matter. If I am destroyed without a clear investigation, my personal loss is small, and although I am destroyed, many people will sympathize. I know that my life will end in the next day or two. I only hope to die knowing why."

　　In fact, this self-criticism was my suicide note. I thought that since they treated me so cruelly, they would never let me go easily, so I knew that I was bound to die. Unexpectedly, on the night when Chairman Mao announced the eight peace conditions, I was released from prison.

　　It has been more than two years now, and my legs have not yet recovered. Whenever I think of secret agents, I hate them from the bottom of my heart. People who have not been harmed cannot understand how hateful secret agents are. They have harmed so many good people! Killed so many patriotic youths! Originally, I thought that after liberation, this group of inhuman things should be eliminated. Unexpectedly, the government is too lenient. Many who should be killed are not killed, and many counter-revolutionary things are still at large. Not only do they not correct their past mistakes and bow to the people, but they still do evil. When the Resist America, Aid Korea movement began, they became even bolder in their reaction. I often felt depressed about this. The People's Government is all good, but it is too lenient towards counter-revolutionary elements. Being lenient towards them is harmful to the people.

　　Since the promulgation of the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, the government has really strictly suppressed them and really killed some counter-revolutionary elements who have committed heinous crimes. Today I finally breathed a sigh of relief. Perhaps some people still have some compassion for those inhuman things, but that is because they have not personally suffered their harm and do not know how hateful those things are. If your children had been killed by secret agents, then today you would applaud the execution of secret agents. Don't just feel compassion when you see counter-revolutionary elements being executed! Don't you feel compassion for the thousands of good people and revolutionary cadres killed by secret agents? Secret agents are inhuman beasts, and those who are persecuted by them are patriotic youth and good people! We should compare both sides and think about it repeatedly. Being kind to counter-revolutionary elements will be harmful to the people. We must look at the problem from the people's standpoint.

　　Today, the government is so strictly suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and I 100% approve of it. I firmly demand that the government must strictly suppress them and not show any mercy.

　　我为什么坚决要求政府严厉镇压反革命？
    北京师范大学体育系主任  徐英超
    我从一九一九年就在教育界工作，从一九二六年，就在北京师范大学任教。凡是熟习我的人，都知道我为人正直，作事认真。但是，在国民党匪帮统治时期，这样作人作事是不允许的，所以我几乎被特务害死。
    一九四八年北京师范大学发生“四、九”血案，特务们半夜闯入学校，鸣枪示威，捣毁教室，打伤学生，绑走学生。我到学生宿舍，看见满床衣服被褥上都是血，满地也都是血。有一片血，一直从台阶上流到台阶下面去。我忍不住自己的悲愤，于是提议召开教授会，支援学生；并发动全体教授去看学生的血迹；并到匪首李宗仁行辕要求释放被捕学生。不料这就是我被特务迫害的主要原因。那时候北京师范大学体育系有一部分学生，在学校里横行霸道，不正经上课，时常打架。我时常劝告他们，那里晓得他们是特务和三青团打手，竟说我压迫了爱国青年，这也是我被迫害的原因。
    一九四八年十二月二十三日夜里，二十多个特务从房上进到教员宿舍里，把宿舍包围起来。十几个特务借口检查户口，闯进我的屋子，几支手枪对着我，不许动。我的小孩子们也都被他们用手枪看起来。他们把所有的箱子，所有的抽屉都打开，把所有的东西都翻乱了，扔得满屋子满地都是。最后把我弄到西单牌楼舍饭寺中裕饭店，在一间小屋子里审问我，说我鼓动学潮，压迫爱国青年，说我是北京市民主同盟的书记，说一张印刷品上有我的名字，向我要民主同盟的名单、电台。其实，我与民主同盟毫无关系。我在教育界工作了三十年，一个民主同盟的同志都不认识，那里会有名单呢？那里有什么电台呢？我说那是有人捏造的。我和他们讲理，那里晓得特务是没有人性的东西，还讲什么理！不由分说就是上刑，六七个人上来，把我按在地上，跪下，把我的嘴用手巾塞住，把一根大杠子放在我的腿肚子上，两个人搬住我的胳膊，一个抓住我的头发，往后一拉，使我上体向后仰过去，这样折在地下，杠子上站上去四个人，用力向下踏，向下压，一边骂，一边压。当时，我感觉腿疼得好像要裂开，好像要涨破。这样压了有半点多钟，我死过去了。等我再活过来，他们还是要名单，要电台。我明明没有。他们就再压。就这样把我压死过去三次，并且指着脸骂我，打我的脸，打得嘴流血。我看他们那个凶恶的样子，像一群恶鬼。后来他们认为压杠子还不够，又换一种刑法，用绳子把我捆上，从肩捆到脚，捆了几十道，然后把我仰放在一张桌子上，脑袋空在桌子外边，一个人抓住我的头发，向下拉住我的脑袋，四个人按住我的胳膊和腿，又一个人坐在我的肚子上。这时候，我一点都不能动了。另外一个人把一条毛巾折上，盖住我的鼻子和嘴，用一把壶灌凉水，连鼻子带嘴一齐往里进水，呛得出不来气，我感觉要蹩死，我拼死挣命；但是，我一点也动不了。一直被灌死过去。就这样灌死过三次。到现在，我每想起来，就必须长吸气，若在夜里想起来，就必须坐起来长吸气。
    后来，他们把我弄到府右街内二分局第一分驻所，把我扔在一间很大的空屋子里。这屋子没有门，许多窗户也是破的。那时候是数九的天气了。就在这样的屋子里，没有炉火，也没有铺的，没有盖的，躺在地上，我的腿四天的工夫没有知觉，四天以后才知道疼，越来越疼，好像要涨破的那样疼痛。
    后来他们又把我架出去审问。这次审我的人是最凶的一个。他的外号叫“人厨子”，意思就是他随便杀人。他杀人不算什么，就好像厨子杀鸡一样。他叫我把民主同盟的人都说出来，把电台交出来。我明明连一个民主同盟的人也不认识，那里有什么名单和电台呢？他面目狰狞地大喊一声“上刑”。于是上来一群人，用麻绳子把我的手倒背着绑起来，用脚踹着绑，绑的非常之紧，把肉皮都勒破了。然后把我倒背手在房梁底下吊起来。吊起来之后，有两个宪兵站在两旁，用脚轮流踹我的腰，使我在空中吊着来回的摆动；并且打我的嘴巴，打得满嘴流血。这样吊了一个多钟头。这还不算，他们又把我的衣服扯下去，把铁通条在炉子里烧红了半尺多长，烫我，烫得嗞啦嗞啦的响，烫得冒烟，把我身上烫烂了好几十块。我咬牙切齿地恨他们。最后我觉得我是必死的了。我只说了一句：“我徐英超是一个什么样的人，叫我这样子死在这里！”说完这话以后，我就昏迷了。
    此后，他们又把我扔到那间破屋子里。我半死地躺在一块席上，昏昏沉沉地听得外边刮着大风，天好像已经黑了，屋里的灯好像半明半灭似的，有两个穿着黑衣裳的人拿着手枪。这时候，我的两条腿被杠子压得已经不能动了，两只胳膊被吊得也不会动了，两只手被绑得失去了知觉，手腕的皮被绳子勒得都掉了，满手都是血，肿得不像人手的样子，满身皮肉都烫烂了，我昏昏沉沉地躺在那里。当时我想：大学教授平时不是很受人尊敬的?？不是应在社会上主持正义的?？不是应当领导青年爱护青年的?？现在，竟受这样残酷的刑罚！竟受这样的侮辱！这群没人性的东西！我如不死，此仇非报不可！我又想，我是必死的了。这就是我疾恶如仇绝不妥协的结果?？思想至此，无限悲愤！
    过了几天，因为他们问不出什么来，于是又改用假装善意的方法。来了一个特务头子和我谈话，劝我坦白，说我若坦白了，就可以不死，并且可受优待，叫我写自白书。我有什么可坦白的呢？遂写了一篇自白书如下：
    “我从事教育三十年，为人正直忠实，作事努力认真。在师大任教，对学生课业严格；但是我喜爱青年。‘四九’事件，学生被打伤，我因情感不能自已，遂有同情学生的言论。对‘政府’表示不满，但无犯法行动，不应只凭一张印刷品写上我的名子，就算是犯死罪的铁证。倘若不调查清楚，而把我毁灭了，我个人损失小，虽被毁灭必有许多人同情。我知道我的生命将在这一两天内结束，我只希望死得明白。”
    其实这篇自白书就是我的绝命书。我想他们既然如此残酷地对待我，则绝不肯轻易放我，因此，我知道我是势在必死。不料在毛主席发表八项和平条件的那天晚上，我竟出狱。
    到现在两年多了，我的腿还不能复原。我每想起特务，就从心里恨。没受过害的人，不能体会到特务有多可恨。他们害了多少好人！杀了多少爱国青年！本来，我想解放了，这群没人性的东西，可该消灭他们了。没想到政府太宽大了，多少该杀的不杀，许多反革命的东西们仍逍遥法外，不但不改前非，不向人民低头，并且仍旧为非做恶。抗美援朝运动开始的时候，他们更大胆的反动起来，我时常为此气闷。人民政府都好，就是对反革命分子太宽大了。对他们宽大，就是对人民有害。
    自从惩治反革命条例公布以后，政府真的严格镇压了，真的杀了些罪大恶极的反革命分子。我今天才出了一口气。也许有人对那些没人性东西们还有些恻隐之心，那是因为没有亲身受过他们的害，不知道那些东西们的可恨。假使您的子女曾被特务们害死，那么今天枪决特务您就要鼓掌称快了。不要光看枪决反革命分子而发恻隐之心啊！难道对于特务所杀的几千几百的善良人民和革命干部不发发恻隐之心么？特务是没人性的禽兽，而被他们迫害的都是爱国青年和善良的人民啊！应该把两方面比较一下，反复地想一想，对于反革命分子仁慈，对于人民就要有害了。我们要站在人民立场看一看问题。
    今天政府这样严厉镇压反革命，我百分之百地赞成。我坚决要求政府必须严厉镇压，一点不要留情。
