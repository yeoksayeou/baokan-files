　　Thanks to the Chinese People for Their Just Aid
    Letter from Korean People's Army Soldiers to the Chinese People
    (1) Dear Chinese People:
    The bloodstains of World War II are not yet dry, and the American imperialists have launched a new war of aggression, attempting to drag all peace-loving people of the world into a large-scale war. They openly invaded our country, cruelly massacred our people, and madly destroyed our peaceful cities and beautiful countryside, causing our millions of people to suffer unprecedented disasters. However, all the massacres and bombings of the American imperialists cannot shake our determination to avenge our fallen compatriots and strive for national independence and freedom. We will fight to the end until we drive them out of our country.
    Dear Chinese People: In the most difficult period of our war against American imperialist aggression and for independence and freedom, you carried forward the great spirit of internationalism, formed the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, and crossed the Yalu River to fight together with us against the invading forces headed by American imperialism, in order to protect your homes and defend your country and world peace. In just a few months, you dealt a fatal blow to the aggressive arrogance of American imperialism and doomed the enemy to extinction. We Korean people will never forget the Chinese people's just aid.
    Today (February 8th) is the third anniversary of the founding of our Korean People's Army. I swear to you: We will certainly be able to repel the American imperialists' aggression against Korea and win the final victory!
    Respectfully wishing the People's Republic of China prosperity and all the people freedom and happiness!
    Long live the friendship between the Korean and Chinese people!
                Korean People's Army Soldier Jin Zhongxuan
    (2) Dear Chinese People:
    When we Korean people were facing the most difficult time in our struggle against the American war of aggression, we received the just support of the Chinese people. This strengthened our will to fight and our confidence in victory. I extend my heartfelt thanks to you.
    Since the Chinese People's Volunteer Army came to our country and fought alongside us, it has severely struck several times the American invading forces and the traitorous Syngman Rhee bandit army, who have committed all kinds of evil on our land, and liberated vast areas of our country, freeing millions of Korean people from the enemy's trampling. This great victory is the result of the struggle of our people and the just support of the Chinese people.
    Dear Chinese People: Defeating American imperialist aggression in Asia and defending peace in Asia and the world is our common struggle goal of the Korean and Chinese people. We believe that the firm unity of the Korean and Chinese people will surely shatter all the aggression of the American imperialists. At present, although the American invading forces are still showing considerable arrogance on the soil of our motherland, they are bound to fail, and final victory must be ours! We will surely be able to drive them out of the land of our motherland!
    Dear Chinese People: With the same feeling as loving my motherland, I hope that China's construction cause will achieve rapid development; because the great China is a fortress for safeguarding the happiness of the people of the East.
                Korean People's Army Soldier Jin Shangjun

### 感谢中国人民正义的援助  朝鲜人民军战士给中国人民的信

　　感谢中国人民正义的援助
    朝鲜人民军战士给中国人民的信
    （一）亲爱的中国人民：
    第二次世界大战血迹未干，美帝国主义者又发动了新的侵略战争，企图将全世界爱好和平的人民，引入大规模战争的火坑里。他们公开侵略我们祖国，残忍地屠杀我国人民，疯狂地破坏我国的和平城市和美丽的农村，使我们千百万人民遭受到人类未曾有过的灾难。但是，美帝国主义者的一切屠杀和轰炸，动摇不了我们为死难同胞复仇及争取民族独立、自由的决心。我们一定斗争到底，直到把它们赶出我国为止。
    亲爱的中国人民：在我们反对美帝国主义侵略，争取独立自由的战争的最艰苦时期，你们发扬了伟大的国际主义精神，组成英勇的中国人民志愿军，为了保家卫国、保卫世界和平，跨过了鸭绿江，和我们共同打击以美帝国主义为首的侵略军队。在短短的几个月中，就致命地打击了美帝国主义的侵略气焰，注定了敌人灭亡的下场。我们朝鲜人民对中国人民正义的援助是永远不会忘记的。
    今天（二月八日）是我们朝鲜人民军创立三周年纪念日。我向你们宣誓：我们一定能够打退美帝国主义者对朝鲜的侵略，争取最后的胜利！
    敬祝中华人民共和国的繁荣和全体人民的自由幸福！
    朝中人民友谊万岁！
                朝鲜人民军战士  金仲铉
    （二）亲爱的中国人民：
    当我们朝鲜人民反对美国侵略战争最艰苦的时候，受到了中国人民正义的支援。这加强了我们斗争的意志和胜利的信心。我向你们致衷心的谢意。
    自从中国人民志愿部队来到我国和我们共同作战以来，已经数次严重地打击了在我国土地上无恶不作的美国侵略军队和卖国贼李承晚匪军，并解放了我国广大的地区，使千百万朝鲜人民从敌人蹂躏下解放出来。这个伟大的胜利，是我国人民的斗争和中国人民正义支援的结果。
    亲爱的中国人民：打败美帝国主义者对亚洲的侵略，保卫亚洲及全世界的和平，是我们朝、中人民共同的斗争目标。我们相信：朝、中两国人民的坚强的团结，一定能粉碎美帝国主义者的一切侵略。在目前，美国侵略军队在我们祖国的土地上，虽然还表现得相当的猖狂；但是，它们是一定要失败的，最后胜利一定是我们的！我们一定能把它们从祖国的土地上驱逐出去！
    敬爱的中国人民：我以爱祖国一样的心情，希望中国的建设事业取得迅速的发展；因为伟大的中国是保卫东方人民幸福的堡垒。
                朝鲜人民军战士  金尚俊
