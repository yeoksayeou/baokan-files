East China and Central South China Launch Spring Afforestation Campaign

The broad masses of peasants in East China and Central South China, with the specific assistance of local people's government forestry departments, are now joyfully planting trees and creating forests on hillsides and riverbanks.

This year's afforestation plan in East China mainly focuses on eliminating barren mountains and wastelands, with a focus on creating water source forests and riverbank protection forests along rivers. To date, in Lishui County, Zhejiang Province alone, farmers have organized 30 afforestation cooperatives and planted more than 2 million trees. In some villages in Jinhua, Tangxi, Tonglu, Fuyang, Jinyun and other places, farmers planted more than 700,000 trees on local barren mountains in just one or two days. Farmers in the suburbs of Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, were initially concerned about planting trees, fearing that the forests would be nationalized. After local government forestry cadres explained the policy to the farmers and promoted cooperative afforestation, the farmers' concerns were eliminated. Farmers in Zhanban Township planted nearly 600,000 Masson pines on more than 2,000 mu of barren mountains in just eleven days. Similarly, in many rural areas of southern Anhui and southern Jiangsu, millions of delicate pine seedlings can now be seen everywhere, being cared for by farmers as if they were wheat seedlings.

In the spring afforestation campaign, farmers in various parts of the Central South region have universally put forward the slogans "Get rich in the long run, plant more trees" and "Eat from the mountains, but nourish the mountains, or future generations will be left bare mountains.” Cooperative afforestation groups or afforestation cooperatives have been widely organized in rural areas. Many farmers bring dry food and plant fruit trees collectively on barren mountains from early morning until dark. At present, farmers in the suburbs of Luoyang City, Henan Province, have planted more than 200,000 trees; farmers in Shantou and Fucun townships in Jia County have planted more than 4,000 mu of fruit trees such as peaches and apricots. Farmers in various parts of Hunan Province are not only cultivating a large number of economic forests, but are also actively creating riverbank protection forests. In Xupu County alone, 400,000 tung trees have been planted, and 1.3 million willow branches have been planted along the Yuan River. Guangdong Province, which was liberated later, has also made significant achievements in afforestation. Farmers in the three districts of Lechang County have now planted more than 2,000 mu of trees and have begun to close off 30,000 mu of mountains for forest cultivation. This year, the 25,000 Yao people in Liannan County also responded to the call of the people's government with unprecedented enthusiasm, planting 1.5 million trees in less than a month, exceeding 60 percent of the original afforestation task.

### 华东中南两区展开春季造林运动

　　华东中南两区展开春季造林运动
    华东、中南两区的广大农民，在当地人民政府林业部门的具体协助下，现正满怀着喜悦，纷纷在山坡、河岸地带植树造林。
    今年华东地区的造林计划，主要是消灭荒山、荒地，并有重点地在江、河沿岸造水源林和护岸林。到目前为止，仅浙江丽水一县的农民，即已组织了三十个造林合作社，植树二百多万株。金华、汤溪、桐庐、富阳、缙云等地部分村庄的农民，仅利用一两天的时间，即在当地荒山上植了七十多万株树。福建省福州市郊的农民起初对植树有顾虑，怕造了林子会归公。后经当地政府林业干部向农民进行解释并提倡合作造林，农民的顾虑即告消除。该市战坂乡农民仅在十一天内即在二千多亩荒山上植了近六十万株马尾松。同样，在皖南和苏南地区的许多农村中，现在也到处可见千百万株娇嫩的松苗，被农民们当作麦苗一样地爱护着。
    中南区各地的农民在今春植树造林运动中，普遍提出“远来富，多种树”和“吃山要养山，山光子孙干”的口号。各地农村已广泛地组织了合作造林小组或造林合作社。许多农民起早摸黑地带着干粮在荒山上集体种果树。现在，河南省洛阳市郊农民已植树二十多万株；郏县的山头、傅村两乡农民已种桃、杏等果树四千多亩。湖南省各地农民不仅大量培植经济林，并正在积极地营造护岸林。仅溆浦一县即已种下四十万株油桐，沅江两岸也种植了一百三十万株柳条。解放较晚的广东省，在造林工作上也有了显著的成绩。该省乐昌县三个区的农民现已植树二千多亩，并开始封山育林三万亩。连南县的二万五千徭族人民，今年也史无前例地以无比热情响应了人民政府的号召，不到一个月即已植树一百五十万株，超过了该处原定植树任务的百分之六十。
