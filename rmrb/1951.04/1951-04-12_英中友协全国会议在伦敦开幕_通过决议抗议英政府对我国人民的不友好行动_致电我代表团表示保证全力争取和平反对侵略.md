　　To Li Yimang, Head of the Chinese People's Delegation: The UK-China Friendship Association deeply regrets that the Chinese People's National Conference for Peace and Friendship is unable to attend our conference due to the actions of our government, and hereby extends our heartfelt greetings to you. We strongly protest this hostile action by our government and have telegraphed people and groups across the country, calling on them to protest as well. We have received the speech you sent us, and we are extremely excited and impressed to learn of the extraordinary achievements of your country's people, and share with you the full determination to achieve lasting world peace. We believe that friendship and trade relations between Britain and China are in the permanent interests of our two peoples. We guarantee to do our utmost to defeat the conspiracy to expand the war in the Far East, not to go to war with China, and to seek a peaceful solution to the Far East issue through negotiations. Long live the friendship between the people of China and Britain. May this friendship last and flourish.

　　Sincerely, Ilerby, President of the UK-China Friendship Association, and Delibon, Secretary-General, on behalf of the entire conference.
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 11th: The National Conference for Peace and Friendship with China, held by the UK-China Friendship Association, opened on the 8th at Beaver Hall in London. Representatives from six national committees of trade unions, one regional committee, twenty-seven trade union branches, ten local trade union representative councils, and five constituency organizations of the Labour Party attended the conference.

　　The statement of the Chinese People's Delegation was read at the meeting. The Chinese People's Delegation was unable to attend the conference because the British government refused to grant entry visas to all members of the delegation. In response, the conference passed a resolution protesting the British government's unfriendly actions.

　　Moffatt, Chairman of the Scottish Mineworkers' Union, said at the meeting: After discussions in the various branches of the Mineworkers' Union, Scottish miners have declared that they firmly oppose Britain's support for American aggression against China. He said: If we let all the trade union masses in our country have such a discussion, we believe that the same conclusion will be reached. He then announced to the enthusiastic applause of the audience: "No British mother wants her son to go to Korea to die for American imperialism and aggression." Moffatt pointed out that MacArthur's statement and the attitude of the US government have created a very serious situation in the Far East. He called on the representatives to do their utmost to support China and strive for peace. He said: "There can be no more delay. It is the responsibility of the broad masses of workers and the progressive movement in our country not to let anyone drag us into a third world war."

　　Many representatives spoke enthusiastically in succession. Hamp, a young Labour Party member from Wandsworth, called on all Labour Party members to fight within their own districts and other organizations to prevent war and stop the attack on China.

　　Main, Secretary-General of the Association of Senior Civil Servants, in his personal capacity, demanded that the vast number of people who oppose fighting China be mobilized.

　　Craig proposed a motion condemning MacArthur's statement calling for war against China, demanding a negotiated settlement of the Korean issue, the withdrawal of British troops from Korea, the complete severance of relations with Chiang Kai-shek, and the implementation of policies to promote British-Chinese trade.

　　Pritt, Vice-Chairman of the National Council of the British Peace Committee, emphasized when talking about the American threat to invade China that whether the Labour government can stop following American policy depends mainly on the efforts of millions of trade union members in Britain.

　　Renowned journalist Montague said in his speech that the Korean War is illegal and barbaric. He called on the representatives to protest this war.

    会上宣读了中国人民代表团的声明，中国人民代表团由于英国政府拒绝给全体团员以入境签证而未能出席大会。大会为此通过一项决议，抗议英国政府的不友好行动。
    苏格兰矿工联盟主席莫法特在会上说：苏格兰矿工在矿工联盟的各个分会中进行了讨论之后，已声明他们坚决反对英国支持美国侵略中国。他说：如果让我国全体工会群众作这样的讨论，我们相信也会得出同样的结论。他接着在会众的热烈喝采声中宣布：“没有一个英国的母亲愿意她的儿子为美国帝国主义和侵略而去朝鲜送命。”莫法特指出：麦克阿瑟的声明和美国政府的态度，已在远东造成了十分严重的局势。他号召代表们竭尽全力支援中国，争取和平。他说：“不能再拖延了。不让任何人把我们拖进第三次世界大战中去，是我国广大的劳工群众和进步运动的责任。”

    英国和平委员会全国理事会副主席普里特谈到美国威胁着要侵略中国时强调指出，工党政府能否停止追随美国政策主要要看英国千百万工会群众的努力而定。
    著名新闻记者蒙塔古在发言中说，朝鲜战争是非法的，是野蛮的。他号召代表们抗议这个战争。
