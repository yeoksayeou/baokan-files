Agricultural Labor Model Shi Yudian
Reports to Chairman Mao on the Situation of Resisting America and Aiding Korea

Dear Chairman Mao:

　　I went to the county government for a meeting, studied current affairs, and understood that resisting America and aiding Korea is a major event. I heard that American imperialism is going to arm Japan again, and that American imperialism is committing atrocities in Korea, raping and plundering. Tears couldn't help but flow from my eyes, and I resolved to contribute to resisting America and aiding Korea. At the meeting in the county, more than three hundred and ninety people competed to donate grain and money to help the Korean people. Song Wanlu, a family member of a revolutionary soldier in my district, donated one hundred catties of millet. I also donated 18,000 yuan to show my love for the Korean people and my hatred for the American devils.

　　After returning to the village, I conducted propaganda in the surrounding six administrative villages. When the masses recalled the atrocities of the Japanese devils in China in those years, they deeply hated American imperialism. Everyone voluntarily donated more than 1,200 catties of millet and some cash. In addition to donating grain and money to support the Volunteer Army, we decided to do a good job in agricultural and sideline production to increase the strength of our country. Since we are near the mountains here, planting trees is very important. I must set an example for the masses. Now I have planted 112 fruit trees. This year I plan to plant 3,000 soft jujube trees, 1,000 walnut trees, and 2,000 mulberry trees, as well as tung trees and ginkgo trees. We must turn the barren mountains on the edge of our village into a beautiful forest garden within three years.

　　For this purpose, our village has established a nine-member forest protection committee, specifically responsible for protecting the mountains and forests.

　　农业劳动模范石玉殿
    向毛主席报告抗美援朝情形亲爱的毛主席：
    我去县府开了会，学习了时事，明白了抗美援朝是一件重要的大事情。我听说美帝国主义又要武装日本，又听说美帝国主义在朝鲜奸淫掳掠，我的眼泪不由地流下来了，我下定决心要出力抗美援朝。在县里开会的三百九十多个人，都争先恐后地献粮献款救济朝鲜人民。我区革命军人家属宋万禄献小米一百斤。我也献出一万八千元，表示我对朝鲜人民的相爱和对美国鬼子的痛恨。
    回村后我就在周围六个行政村进行宣传，群众想起当年日本鬼子在中国的暴行，就十分痛恨美帝国主义。大家自愿献出小米一千二百余斤和一部分现款。除了捐献粮款支援志愿军以外，我们决定要搞好农业和副业生产，增加咱们国家的力量。咱们这里靠山，栽树很要紧，我一定得给群众做个样子，现下我已栽了一百一十二棵果子树。今年我准备栽软枣树三千棵，核桃树一千棵，山蚕树二千棵，其他还有桐树和白果树。咱们这村边的一片荒山，一定要在三年内叫它变成美丽的林园。
    为了这个目的，我村已成立了九个人的护林委员会，专门负责保护山林。
