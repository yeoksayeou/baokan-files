Xinhua News Agency, April 17th: The incident of the Iranian military police massacring oil workers in Abadan has aroused great anger among the Iranian people. In Abadan, the striking workers' opposition to imperialism has been heightened by this incident. Disregarding the martial law banning public gatherings, 20,000 workers in the area held another demonstration on the 15th, chanting anti-British and anti-American slogans, demanding the immediate nationalization of oil, and calling on all patriotic Iranians not to work for the imperialists. The striking workers also set up picket lines around the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's large refinery, causing the Abadan refinery, one of the world's largest refineries, to announce its closure. The workers angrily demanded: "Throw the robbers into the sea!" Similar demonstrations were held by striking workers in the oil-producing areas at the top of the Persian Gulf. The broad masses of working people in Tehran are also extremely indignant.

The Iranian government used troops armed with tanks and armored vehicles to suppress the striking workers. The troops opened fire on the demonstrating masses. On the 13th, six striking workers in Abadan were shot dead. On the 14th, another worker in Isfahan was shot dead. The Iranian government is now dispatching a large number of troops to Abadan and has arrested 30 striking workers. Another 250 workers have been expelled from Abadan.

British authorities continue to send more fleets to threaten striking workers. On the 15th, two more British warships sailed from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. The British Ambassador to Tehran, Sir Francis Shepherd, met with Iranian Prime Minister Hossein Ala again on the 14th, stating that Britain would take direct "action" at an "appropriate time."

The US Ambassador to Tehran, Grady, also issued a statement on the 15th, openly expressing the United States' coveting of Iranian oil. He said: The United States is "concerned about the situation in Iran" and also "concerned about Iranian oil" because Iranian oil is "a very valuable asset."

　　伊朗政府军队竟枪杀罢工的石油工人
    阿巴丹等地罢工工人示威抗议
    伊朗人民反帝情绪益形高涨
    【新华社十七日讯】伊朗阿巴丹石油工人被伊朗军警屠杀的事件，激起了伊朗人民的巨大愤怒。在阿巴丹，罢工工人反对帝国主义的情绪，已因这次事件益形高涨。该地二万工人不顾禁止公共集会的戒严命令，又于十五日举行示威，高呼反英、反美的口号，要求立即实行石油国有化，并号召全体爱国的伊朗人不要为帝国主义者工作。罢工工人同时在英伊石油公司的大炼油厂周围，布置了纠察线，使该世界最大炼油厂之一——阿巴丹炼油厂，宣告停工关门。工人们愤怒地要求：“把强盗丢到海里去！”在波斯湾顶端的油产区，罢工工人也举行了类似的示威。德黑兰的广大劳动人民也是极为愤慨。
    伊朗政府以坦克和装甲车武装的军队镇压罢工工人。军队开枪射击示威群众。十三日，阿巴丹的罢工工人有六名被枪杀。十四日，伊斯法罕又有工人一名被枪杀。伊朗政府现正派大批部队前往阿巴丹，并已逮捕了罢工工人三十名。另有工人二百五十人被驱逐出阿巴丹。
    英国当局继续增派舰队威胁罢工工人。十五日又有两艘英国军舰自地中海开往波斯湾。英国驻德黑兰大使希佛德于十四日再度往见伊朗总理侯赛尼·阿拉，表示英国在“适当的时候”将直接“采取行动”。
    美国驻德黑兰大使格拉第亦于十五日发表声明，公开表示美国垂涎伊朗的石油。他说：美国“关心伊朗的情势”，也“关心伊朗的石油”，因为伊朗石油是“一个很有价值的资产”。
