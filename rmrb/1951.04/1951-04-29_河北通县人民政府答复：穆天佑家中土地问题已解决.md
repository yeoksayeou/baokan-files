    Reply from Tong County People's Government, Hebei:
    The Land Problem of Mu Tianyou's Family Has Been Resolved
    To the Editor:
    The People's Daily "Readers' Letters" page published a letter from revolutionary soldier Comrade Mu Tianyou regarding his family's land problem on April 11th. Our reply is as follows:
    Mu Tianyou's elderly mother, Cheng Furen, is a primary school teacher in Xiaoshengmiao Village, in our county, earning a monthly salary of 195 <i>jin</i> of rice. During the land reform in 1949, she was not allocated any land.
    In October 1950, Comrade Mu Tianyou, seeing that his mother was old and fearing that she would have no means of support in the future, therefore requested land. At that time, because it was during the autumn harvest, it was not possible to adjust the land immediately, so we promised to resolve this issue after the autumn harvest. Later, because Xiaoshengmiao was re-designated from the Sixth District to the jurisdiction of the Chengguan District, this matter was put aside for a period of time, until January of this year when it was decided to allocate her five <i>mu</i> of land. The housing problem is still under consideration for a solution.
    We did not resolve this problem in a timely manner, and we did not promptly respond to Comrade Mu Tianyou's letter (one time). This is indeed wrong. After examining the reasons, this is because we did not pay enough attention to the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary soldiers. We saw that Mu's mother had an income of more than 100 <i>jin</i> of millet per month and that her life was not a problem, so we did not value this matter. Now, in addition to conducting a self-criticism, we also express our apologies to Comrade Mu Tianyou and his mother.

### 河北通县人民政府答复：穆天佑家中土地问题已解决

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    河北通县人民政府答复：
    穆天佑家中土地问题已解决编辑同志：
    四月十一日人民日报读者来信专页发表了革命军人穆天佑同志对他家土地问题的来信，现在答复如下：
    穆天佑同志的老母亲程辅仁，在本县小圣庙村任小学教员，每月薪资米一百九十五斤。一九四九年土地改革时未分给她土地。
    一九五○年十月，穆天佑同志见其母年老，恐将来生活无着，因此提出了土地要求。当时因为在秋收期间，不能马上调济，即答应在秋收后给解决这个问题。以后又因为小圣庙由六区改划到城关区管辖，所以又把这件事搁置了一个时期，直到今年一月间才决定分给她土地五亩，房子问题尚在研究解决办法。
    对于这一问题，我们解决的不够及时，对穆天佑同志的来信（一次）又未及时答复，这确实是不对的。检查原因，这是由于我们对优待革命军人家属的工作重视不够，我们看到穆老大娘一月有一百多斤小米收入，生活不成问题，所以就没有看重这件事。现在我们除了作了一番检讨以外，并向穆天佑同志和他的母亲表示歉意。
          通县县长  李子凡
