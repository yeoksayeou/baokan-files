The Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association has issued a "Notice on Responding to the Resolution of the World Peace Council to Popularize and Deepen the Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in Preparation for the 'May Day' Labor Day." It states: Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries are the three major political tasks of the Chinese people at present. We call on all levels of our party organizations and all members to earnestly abide by the March 14th notice of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and formulate plans to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea based on local conditions. All party members should immediately mobilize the masses, convene various meetings to discuss the current political situation, denounce the crimes of the U.S. and Japanese aggressors and their running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and special agents in persecuting the people, hold signature campaigns to support the conclusion of a peace treaty, hold votes on the Japanese issue, or sign letters to oppose the arming of Japan. This year on "May Day," large-scale demonstrations and parades will be held across the country. We require organizations at all levels and all party members to make preparations as early as possible under the leadership of the party and the local people's government, and to vigorously mobilize the masses to participate in this movement. Regarding slogans, leaflets, wall newspapers, murals, as well as the routes, flags, transportation, food and drink, and medical aid for demonstrations and parades, all must be planned properly in advance. In a word, we must be determined to do this work well. In the work of land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, we require every comrade to stand firm and distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. When land reform struggles relate to oneself, one must be even more firm and never waver. We must always be vigilant and expose all reactionary elements.
