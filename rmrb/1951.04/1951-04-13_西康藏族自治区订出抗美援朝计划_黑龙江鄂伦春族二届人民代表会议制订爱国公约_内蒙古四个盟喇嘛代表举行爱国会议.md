Xinhua News Agency, Ya'an, April 11th: The Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province has formulated a plan for carrying out the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement throughout the region this year.

The Resist America and Aid Korea Movement has been initially launched in some towns and villages in the region. More than 10,000 people in Kangding city and its suburbs have participated in this movement. Many industries, resident groups, and some institutions have formulated patriotic pacts. Due to the vast area, inconvenient transportation, and dispersed population of the autonomous region, this movement has not yet been widely carried out among the broad masses of Tibetan people. Therefore, the plan for carrying out the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement first stipulates that each county should immediately establish a Resist America and Aid Korea branch, using villages, temples, schools, and institutions as units to invite people to give current affairs reports to people from all walks of life in turn, so that everyone in the region receives patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea. The plan also stipulates that from now until the end of July, the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement in the region will focus on popularization and strive for gradual deepening. On May 1st, the Resist America and Aid Korea branches in each county will preside over demonstrations in the county people's government seat; then, marches and accusation meetings will be held in districts and townships, combined with the current central work, to mobilize local people to sign patriotic pacts. Strive to have more than 50% of the population in the region sign the declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact by the end of July, and more than 70% of the population receive education on resisting America and aiding Korea. The plan finally stipulates that after July, the main focus will be on the deepening stage. The Resist America and Aid Korea branches in each county will regularly hold representative conferences on resisting America and aiding Korea to check the implementation of patriotic pacts in various places and arrange new tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, April 11th: The Oroqen people in the Heihe Special District of Heilongjiang Province, in the far northeast, held their second representative conference in early March. At the meeting, the representatives listened to Yue Lin, the leader of the Oroqen Nationality Coordination Office, compare and analyze the two different lives of the Oroqen people before and after liberation. He called on everyone to love the motherland and resolutely oppose the United States arming Japan to protect today's good life. After listening to the report, the representatives condemned the crimes of Japanese imperialism and stated that they would resolutely not allow the United States to rearm Japan. Gegen Torlegur, the principal of the Oroqen Nationality Primary School in Inner Mongolia, who came to Heihe to visit the Oroqen people, said: "The Japanese devils simply did not treat our Oroqen compatriots as human beings. They politically oppressed and deceived us, economically cruelly exploited us, and used opium and other poisons to harm us, trying to exterminate our race. Without the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we would never be able to stand up!" At this conference, the representatives discussed fire prevention and forest protection work and formulated four patriotic pacts: (1) Love the motherland and Chairman Mao; (2) Support the Chinese Communist Party, support the People's Government, and oppose American imperialism rearming Japan; (3) Abide by government laws and regulations, respond to government calls, protect forests, and cherish state property; (4) Increase vigilance, prevent spies, special agents, and bandits, and strictly prohibit the cultivation of opium.

Note: The Oroqen nationality is scattered in the Heilongjiang River Basin and the Greater Khingan Mountains of Inner Mongolia, relying on hunting in the mountains and forests for a living all year round. During the Japanese occupation of Northeast China, the Japanese invaders provoked the feelings of the Oroqen and Han people, prohibiting the two ethnic groups from interacting, and plundered the valuable mountain products and furs hunted by the Oroqen people by brutal means, and poisoned them with large amounts of opium. As a result, they lived a long-term primitive life, and the population decreased year by year. According to statistics at the time of liberation in 1945, the Oroqen population in Heilongjiang Province had decreased from more than 4,000 at the time of the "September 18th Incident" to more than 900, of which 80% of the young adults over the age of 18 smoked opium. After the liberation of Northeast China, the Oroqen people were allocated land and houses in the land reform. Oroqen people have been elected to participate in the people's representative conferences at the provincial and county levels, and last year, an agency for managing their own ethnic affairs, the Coordination Office, was established. After the economic life improved, the days of wearing animal skins in winter and summer are gone. The Oroqen people in Aihui County have all moved into new houses. At this representative conference, Yue Lin, the leader of the Coordination Office, announced that the Coordination Office would reward Oroqen women who gave birth to four or more children.

Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: Lama representatives from the Xing'an League, Hulunbuir League, Xilin Gol League, and Chahar League of Inner Mongolia held a patriotic conference in Zhangjiakou City in early March. Among the representatives present were Living Buddha Maidar Gegen of Xing'an League, Living Buddha Gala Sengge Gegen of Hulunbuir League, and Chagan Gegen of Xilin Gol League, who had participated in the National Day celebrations in Beijing last year. After discussing the current domestic and international situation, the representatives formulated five patriotic pacts based on the specific circumstances of the lamas in Inner Mongolia, as a common goal for the above-mentioned leagues to strive for in the future: (1) Support Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and support the Common Program; (2) Oppose American imperialism's aggression against our country's territory of Taiwan and our neighbor Korea, oppose American imperialism rearming Japan, and actively participate in the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement with various concrete actions; (3) Resolutely support the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, expose counter-revolutionary elements, and oppose spreading rumors to confuse the public; (4) Improve lama medical technology and serve the people; (5) Run lama schools and strengthen ideological education on loving the nation and loving the motherland.

In addition: Lamas from all over Inner Mongolia have donated more than 4 million Mongolian currency to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's soldiers.

　　西康藏族自治区订出抗美援朝计划
    黑龙江鄂伦春族二届人民代表会议制订爱国公约
    内蒙古四个盟喇嘛代表举行爱国会议
    【新华社雅安十一日电】西康省藏族自治区已订出全区本年度开展抗美援朝运动的计划。
    该区的抗美援朝运动，已在部分城镇和乡村中初步展开。康定城区和近郊已有万余人参加了这一运动。有许多行业、居民小组和某些机关都订立了爱国公约。由于该自治区的地区辽阔，交通不便，人民居住分散，这一运动还未在广大的藏族人民中普遍开展。为此，在开展抗美援朝运动的计划中，首先规定：各县应立即成立抗美援朝支会，以乡村、寺庙、学校、机关为单位，请人轮回向各界人民作时事报告，使全区每个人都受到抗美援朝爱国主义的教育。计划中还规定从现在到七月底，全区的抗美援朝运动以普及为主，求得逐步深入。五月一日，由各县抗美援朝支会主持，在县人民政府所在地，分别举行示威游行；然后，再以区、乡为单位举行游行和召开控诉会，结合当前的中心工作，发动当地人民签订爱国公约。争取全区在七月底有百分之五十以上的人口在关于缔结和平公约的宣言上签名，和百分之七十以上的人口受到抗美援朝的教育。计划最后规定：七月以后主要为深入阶段，各县抗美援朝支会定期召开抗美援朝代表会议，检查各地爱国公约执行情形和布置新的任务。
    【新华社齐齐哈尔十一日电】东北极北部黑龙江省黑河专区境内的鄂伦春族人民于三月初举行了第二届代表会议。会上，各代表听取了该民族协领公署岳林协领把鄂伦春族人民解放前后的两种不同生活作了对比和分析以后，他号召大家热爱祖国，坚决反对美国武装日本，以保卫今天的美好生活。代表们听完报告后，纷纷控诉日本帝国主义的罪行，表示坚决不能允许美国重新武装日本。来黑河访问鄂伦春民族的内蒙古鄂伦春族小学校长格根托勒古尔说：“日本鬼子根本不把我们鄂伦春族同胞当人，在政治上压迫与蒙蔽我们，在经济上残酷剥削我们，并用大烟等毒物来残害我们，想使我们灭种。如果没有毛主席和共产党的领导，我们永远也翻不过身来！”在这次会议上，代表们讨论了防火护林工作，并制订四项爱国公约：（一）爱祖国，爱毛主席；（二）拥护中国共产党，拥护人民政府，反对美帝国主义重新武装日本；（三）遵守政府法令，响应政府号召，保护森林，爱护国家财产；（四）提高警惕，防奸防特防匪，严禁种植鸦片。
    按：鄂伦春民族散居于黑龙江流域及内蒙古兴安岭一带，常年依靠山林狩猎为生。日寇在侵占东北时期，挑拨鄂、汉人民情感，禁止两族人民互相来往，用残暴的手段掠夺鄂伦春人民所猎获的贵重山货和皮张，并以大量鸦片来毒害他们。因此，使他们过着长期的原始生活，人口逐年减少。据一九四五年解放时统计，黑龙江省内的鄂伦春族人口已由“九一八”时的四千多人减至九百多人，其中十八岁以上的青壮年有百分之八十吸食鸦片。东北解放后，鄂伦春人民在土地改革中分到了土地和房屋。在省、县各级人民代表会议中，鄂伦春人都选有自己的代表参加，并于去年建立了管理自己民族事务的机关——协领公署。经济生活上升后，过去冬夏都穿着兽皮的日子已经不复返了。瑷珲全县的鄂伦春人，更已全部住上了新房。在这次代表会议上，岳林协领宣布：鄂伦春族妇女生孩子四个以上，协领公署即予以奖励。
    【新华社十一日讯】内蒙古兴安盟、呼纳盟、锡林郭勒盟和察哈尔盟的喇嘛代表曾于上月初旬在张家口市举行了爱国会议。出席代表中有去年曾来京参加国庆盛典的兴安盟迈达尔葛根活佛、呼纳盟嘎拉僧葛根活佛及锡林郭勒盟查干葛根活佛。代表们在讨论了目前的国内外形势以后，根据内蒙古喇嘛的具体情况，订出五项爱国公约，作为上述各盟喇嘛今后共同努力的目标：（一）拥护毛主席和中国共产党，拥护共同纲领；（二）反对美帝国主义侵略我国领土台湾和我们的邻邦朝鲜，反对美帝国主义重新武装日本，积极以各种具体行动参加抗美援朝运动；（三）坚决拥护政府镇压反革命，检举反革命分子，反对造谣惑众；（四）改进喇嘛医疗技术，为人民服务；（五）开办喇嘛学校，加强爱民族爱祖国的思想教育。
    又讯：内蒙古各地喇嘛已捐出蒙币四百余万元慰劳中朝人民战士。
