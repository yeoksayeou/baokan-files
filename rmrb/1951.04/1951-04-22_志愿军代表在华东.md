　　Chinese People's Volunteer Army, at the invitation of the China Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, has sent two groups of representatives back to the country to report to the people of the motherland on the situation of the Volunteer Army fighting in Korea. These two groups of representatives have gone to East China, Central South, Northwest and North China in three groups to work. Their work has had a great impact on the people in various places. The following introduces the situation of a Volunteer Army representative group composed of comrades Chai Chuanruo, Dong Lefu, and Dou Shaoqi working in various parts of East China.
　　From the beginning of March to the beginning of April, the Volunteer Army representative group successively made reports to people from all walks of life in Jinan, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhu. They made six reports in Jinan, with more than 80,000 listeners, 49 reports in Shanghai, with more than 430,000 listeners, 21 reports in Nanjing, with more than 340,000 listeners, and five reports in Wuhu, with more than 71,000 listeners. A total of 81 reports were made, with more than 930,000 listeners. More than 300,000 people in Shanghai and more than 100,000 people in Nanjing heard the Volunteer Army report through radio broadcasts. Other parts of East China also widely organized people from all walks of life to listen to Volunteer Army broadcasts. As for the number of people who heard the Volunteer Army report through the transmission of representatives from all walks of life, it was even greater.
　　The representatives of the Volunteer Army were warmly welcomed by the people everywhere. Wherever the representatives of the Volunteer Army went, it was crowded with people. The people in various places regarded it as a great honor to see the face of the Volunteer Army and to be able to shake hands with the Volunteer Army.
　　The people in various places saw the heroic example of the Chinese people in the Volunteer Army, and they were all moved by the heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army. More than 10,000 student representatives in Shanghai held a welcome meeting in Yiyuan in the rain. It was not until the Volunteer Army finished the report that many students realized that the house was leaking and their bodies were soaked by the rain. At the welcome meeting of all students of a certain college in Nanjing, Representative Chai Chuanruo reported for more than four hours, and the audience still felt unsatisfied. A teacher from a middle school in Shanghai took advantage of various opportunities to listen four times in a row, a reporter from a newspaper listened eight times in a row, and the staff of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government listened more than ten times, and still listened with relish. Some student representatives in Shanghai disguised themselves as Volunteer Army soldiers when they went back to convey the report, solemnly conveyed it in the first person, and the students enthusiastically presented flowers and saluted them. Many people felt that "a surge of energy was added to their bodies" after listening to the report. Some relatively backward masses also said: "In the past, I saw what was said in the newspaper, and I still didn't understand it. I thought it was for propaganda. This time, it's real people telling real things, not fake at all, proving that what is said in the newspaper is completely true."
　　In the report, the Volunteer Army used concrete facts to expose the atrocities of the American aggressors, greatly arousing the righteous indignation of the people and strengthening their hatred of the United States. When more than 3,000 people from the cultural and press circles in Shanghai gathered to listen to the report of the Volunteer Army representatives, many female writers wiped their tears with handkerchiefs when they heard about the atrocities of the American aggressors. The crowd was so indignant that the reporter was forced to stop speaking for more than ten minutes. The audience spontaneously shouted slogans dozens of times, one after another, which was difficult to restrain: "Down with the heinous American imperialism!" "Avenge the Korean people!" "Defend human civilization!" "Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!" ... When more than 10,000 teachers from universities and middle schools in Shanghai listened to the report of the Volunteer Army, many old professors angrily shouted slogans and sang "Down with the American wolves!" during the break. Many listeners said: "I used to think that the United States was more civilized than Japan, but now I know that they are more barbaric than Japan!" The reaction of the troops in Nanjing who listened to the report was: when they heard about the enemy's cruelty, there was no one who didn't gnash their teeth; when they heard about our victory, there was no one who didn't cheer.
　　The representatives of the Volunteer Army told the people in various places about the hard struggle of the Volunteer Army to overcome difficulties, which has a great inspiring effect on the people in various places. The representatives of the Shandong labor model congress were moved to tears when they heard the story of the Volunteer Army fighting against the enemy in the ice and snow, enduring hunger and cold. They held the hands of the Volunteer Army representatives tightly and said: "We old Shandong people have made up our minds this time. If you want money, we have money; if you want grain, we have grain; if you want people, we have people." "Our work is far worse than yours. We must tell all the old Shandong people about your hard work and great achievements." Many workers and staff members of organs in Nanjing felt that when they thought of the Volunteer Army while working, they would gain a surge of energy, feeling that if they didn't work hard, they would be "letting down the Volunteer Army"; "We should work hard and shouldn't complain." Wang Chuanfa, a member of the work-relief engineering team, said after listening to the report: "Although the welcome meeting has passed, the words of the Volunteer Army representatives are still ringing in my ears. The Volunteer Army drinks snow and chews water and eats potato skins, and still sheds blood and fights for the people. I usually frown when the food is not good, and I am unwilling to go on business trips without a bicycle. Thinking about it, I am really ashamed!" Wang Zixia, a female member of a farmers' association in the suburbs of Nanjing, said: "We are not suffering from eating vegetable porridge in the rear; after listening to the report this time, we have more confidence in overcoming difficulties and getting through the spring famine." After listening to the report, the students of Tongji University in Shanghai added a clause to their patriotic convention: "Resolutely obey the organization's assignments." The industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai are also discussing "how to be worthy of the Volunteer Army."
　　The report of the Volunteer Army representatives gave the people in various parts of East China a great education. Therefore, these reports became a powerful factor in promoting the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and various works in East China. The workers in Nanjing proposed "to improve technology and do a good job in production like Guo Zhongtian's heroic platoon improved tactics to win battles." After listening to the report, the workers of Shanghai Meiguang Bleaching Factory bleached 30,000 more pieces of cloth in three days; it is estimated that a workshop will save 24 million yuan worth of fuel coal per month. After listening to the report, the workers of Shanghai Iron and Steel No. 2 Factory completed the quota standard of four-point bamboo steel that night, breaking the routine. The workers of Qixin Yarn Factory completed the work that used to take ten hours in eight hours. In the past, it took nine workers two days to wipe a No. 3 car in the cleaning room of the factory, but now five workers can wipe it in two and a half hours, and they can wipe an additional unpacking car. The farmers in the suburbs of Nanjing unanimously expressed their determination to increase grain production. They said: "The Volunteer Army guards the gate, and we can get the land. If we don't produce more grain, how can we be worthy of the Volunteer Army." The troops and public security forces in various places have guaranteed to do a good job in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and improve combat skills to cooperate with the victory of the Volunteer Army. The students are determined to study hard and guarantee to step up the propaganda of Resist America, Aid Korea. The report of the Volunteer Army also had a great impact on the cadres working in various agencies and organizations. Many agencies in Nanjing and Shanghai reflected: "After listening to the report, those who were uneasy are at ease, and those who were emotional are not emotional."

　　志愿军代表在华东
    中国人民志愿军，应抗美援朝总会的邀请，先后派了两批代表回国，向祖国的人民报告志愿军在朝鲜作战的情况。这两批代表已先后分三组前往华东、中南、西北和华北各地工作。他们的工作在各地人民群众中发生了极大的影响。下面介绍的是由柴川若、董乐辅、窦少毅三位同志组成的一个志愿军代表小组在华东各地工作的情形。
    自三月初到四月初为止，志愿军代表小组先后在济南、上海、南京、芜湖四个城市向各界人民作了报告。他们在济南作了报告六次，听众八万余人，在上海作了报告四十九次，听众四十三万余人，在南京作了报告二十一次，听众三十四万人，在芜湖作了报告五次，听众七万一千余人。总计报告八十一次，听众九十三万余人。经过无线电广播听到志愿军报告的，在上海有三十万人，在南京有十万人以上。华东区其他各地也广泛组织各界人民收听志愿军广播。至于经过各界代表的传达听到志愿军报告的人数更多。
    志愿军的代表们受到各地人民热烈的欢迎。志愿军的代表到了那里，那里就挤满了人群。各地人民都把看见志愿军的面、能和志愿军握一握手，看作莫大的光荣。
    各地人民在志愿军的身上，看到了中国人民的英雄榜样，他们都为志愿军的英雄事迹所感动。上海万余学生代表冒雨在逸园举行欢迎大会，直到志愿军报告完毕，许多学生才发觉房子漏雨，自己身上给雨湿透了。在南京某学院全体学员的欢迎大会上，柴川若代表报告了四个多小时，听众还感到不满足。上海某中学教员，利用各种机会连听四次，某报记者连听八次，上海市人民政府交际处的工作人员连听十多次，还听得津津有味。上海有些学生代表回去传达时，化装成志愿军的样子，郑重其事地用第一人称传达，学生们一样热烈地向他们献花致敬。许多人在听报告后觉得“身上增加了一股劲”。有些比较落后的群众也说：“过去看见报上说的，还有些不明白，认为是为了宣传，这回可是真人讲真事，一点不假，证明报上说的也完全不假。”
    志愿军在报告中，用具体事实揭发了美国侵略者的暴行，大大地激发了人民群众的义愤，加强了他们的仇美心理。当上海文化界新闻界三千余人集会听志愿军代表报告，听到美国侵略者的暴行时，许多女作家用手帕揩眼泪，群情激愤，使报告人被迫停止讲话达十余分钟。听众自发地呼口号达数十次，此起彼落，难以抑止：“打倒万恶的美帝国主义！”“为朝鲜人民复仇！”“保卫人类的文明！”“中国人民志愿军万岁！”……上海大中学教员万余人听志愿军报告时，许多老教授愤而高呼口号，并在休息时高唱“打倒美国野心狼！”。许多听众说：“过去以为美国比日本文明，现在才知道他们比日本更野蛮！”南京的部队听报告的反应是：听到敌人的残暴，没有不咬牙的；听到咱们的胜利，没有不欢呼的。
    志愿军代表在报告中，把志愿军艰苦奋斗克服困难的情形告诉给各地人民，这对于各地人民有极大的激励作用。山东劳动模范代表大会的代表们听了志愿军在冰天雪地忍饥受寒战胜敌人的故事，大家都感动得流泪。他们紧握住志愿军代表的手说：“咱们老山东这回都下了决心，要钱有钱，要粮有粮，要人有人。”“我们的工作比你们差得远了，一定把你们的劳苦功高告诉给全山东的老百姓。”南京的许多工人和机关工作人员，听了报告，在工作的时候，只要一想起志愿军，身上便增加了一股劲，感觉自己不好好工作，就是“对不起志愿军”；“应当好好干，不应当叫苦。”工赈工程队王传法听过报告后说：“欢迎会虽然开过了，志愿军代表的话还在耳边响，志愿军饮雪嚼水吃洋芋皮，还为人民流血奋斗，我平常饭菜不好就绉眉头，没有自行车就不愿出公差，想想真羞愧！”南京市郊一农会女会员王子霞说：“我们在后方吃菜稀饭并不算苦；这次我们听了报告，对克服困难度过春荒更有信心了。”上海同济大学学生听了报告后，就在自己的爱国公约上加了一条“坚决服从组织分配”。上海工商界也在讨论“要怎样才能对得起志愿军”。
    志愿军代表的报告，给了华东各地人民很大的教育，因此，这些报告成了推动华东各地抗美援朝运动以及各种工作的一个有力因素。南京的工人们提出“要像郭忠田英雄排改进战术打胜仗一样，改进技术，搞好生产”。上海美光漂布厂工人听了报告之后，在三天之内多漂了三万匹布；预计一个车间每月将节省价值二千四百万元的燃煤。上海钢铁二厂的工人，听了传达报告后，当晚就突破常例地完成了四分竹节钢的定额标准。启新纱厂工人在八小时中完成了过去要十小时才能完成的工作。该厂清花间的工人，过去揩一部三号车，九个工人两天还做不完，现在五个工人在两个半小时内就揩好了，并可加揩一部拆包车。南京市郊的农民一致表示决心增加粮食生产，他们说：“志愿军守住大门，我们才分到地，不多打粮食，怎对得起志愿军哪。”各地的驻军和公安部队都保证要做好镇压反革命的工作，提高战斗技术，以与志愿军的胜利相配合。学生们决心努力学习，并保证加紧宣传抗美援朝。志愿军的报告，在各机关团体的工作干部中也发生了很大影响。南京、上海许多机关反映：“听了报告后，不安心的安心了，闹情绪的不闹了。”
