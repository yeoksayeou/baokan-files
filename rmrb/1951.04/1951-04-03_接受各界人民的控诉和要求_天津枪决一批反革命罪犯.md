Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd. The Military Control Commission Military Law Office of Tianjin Municipality, having accepted accusations and demands from all walks of life in the city, executed a batch of counter-revolutionary criminals on March 31st, in accordance with the Regulations for Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries.

Among the executed counter-revolutionaries were a large number of arch-criminals who had long engaged in evil deeds, sabotaged revolutionary work, suppressed worker and student movements, and bore heavy debts of blood. For example, Yuan Baohuang, a notorious labor traitor who had consistently harmed workers and sabotaged the worker movement, served as an executive member of the Tianjin Municipal Party Headquarters of the bandits, a pseudo-National Assembly representative, and a standing director of the bandit Federation of Trade Unions after the Japanese surrendered. He controlled the pseudo-Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and suppressed the worker movement. During the Tianjin tram workers' strike in 1948, he first instructed his henchmen to threaten workers with pistols, and then colluded with bandit police and military to block the company gate with armored vehicles, arresting nine workers including Du Baoli. According to his own confession, he had carried out similar incidents thirty-five times. Zhu Shiyin, the major special agent who manufactured the "Panjiayu Massacre," led Japanese invaders in slaughtering 1,200 of our people and burning more than 1,000 houses, leaving the village desolate and reduced to rubble. Cao Qiang, an American-Chiang special agent, as the chief of the Tianjin bandit Inspection Office, directed his subordinates to search our Tianjin office and arrest our cadres during the "peace negotiations" in 1946. In the same year, he murdered four of our captured soldiers and colluded with the intelligence department of the U.S. Marine Corps to collect information about our side. Later, he was transferred to Jinan to preside over special agent work, where he captured and harmed more than 60 of our cadres and innocent people. Guo Yongtu, a special agent devoid of humanity, was the director of the "Tianjin Liaison Office of the Military Liaison Group," a hidden special agent organization. He led bandit troops in attacking our liberated areas more than 40 times, injuring more than 100 of our revolutionary personnel. He even inhumanly dissected and ate the hearts of our revolutionary personnel and used non-custodial punishments such as burying alive and drowning to kill six of our staff members and four village cadres.

Another group consisted of incorrigible special agents, all of whom were former Japanese, puppet, American, and Chiang special agents. After liberation, they refused to register and continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, either providing intelligence to the enemy or infiltrating our organs, factories, and schools to carry out sabotage. For example, Sun Furui and Li Zhongshi were originally Japanese and puppet military officers, and later served in important military and political positions in the Chiang bandit army. They assassinated our revolutionary cadres Zhao Yunluo and others, as well as many village cadres, and organized bandits to infiltrate our liberated areas to assassinate revolutionary cadres. After liberation, Sun, Li, and others organized the bandit "Investigation Office of the Party, Government, and Military of the Pingjin-Hebei-Jehol Area," under the command of Chiang bandit special agent Zhang Qingen, and operated in Beijing and Tianjin, opening Qida Antique Shop and soy sauce shop in Tianjin as cover, harboring and releasing the major special agent Liu Zhao, and colluding with retained employee Guo Yanting to gather our national secrets. Liu Lida was a member of the Kuomintang district branch and a special agent of the "Zhongyi Pujishe." After liberation, he concealed his reactionary identity and lurked in the repair shop of the Haihe Engineering Office, where he sabotaged the factory's largest motor. Zhao Hongyan and Xu Fenghui were the principal figures of the Chiang bandit special agent organization "Tianjin People's National Construction Advancement Association," which used Catholicism as a cover. They planned to infiltrate our organs, factories, and schools to carry out assassinations, and even attempted to establish counter-revolutionary armed forces. Zhongtong special agents Chen Xumian, Bai Jingyun, and others lurked in the railway department after liberation, plotting sabotage, damaging locomotives several times, disrupting traffic safety, and attempting to burn locomotives.

Another batch of executed special agents were bandits who had infiltrated from Taiwan and special agents who, after liberation, colluded with special agents to establish reactionary organizations and engage in counter-revolutionary activities. For example, Zhu Rui, Wang Sichi, Dong Quanqing, and others were key criminals of the special agent organization "29th Column of the Chinese People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," directly commanded by Chiang bandit special agent Zheng Jiemin. They attempted to establish a maritime base, but their ships were damaged at sea, and they temporarily disguised themselves as refugees, hoping to land and lurk, taking advantage of opportunities to cause chaos. Liu Jinyong, a military secret agent, infiltrated North China under the orders of the Taiwan Chiang bandits to establish a communication network and gather information about our troops' equipment and troop deployment. Cui Tongqi and Fan Yuhe were key criminals of the bandit "Second Department of the Directly Subordinate Ministry of National Defense Anti-Communist Youth National Salvation Team," responsible for carrying out sabotage in the railway bureau. In September 1949, they pulled the main power switch of the East Station, causing a seven-minute power outage, and secretly photographed the distribution panel, attempting to carry out an explosion.

There was a group of local tyrants and porters who were murderers. For many years, they had exploited workers, oppressed citizens, set up gambling dens, engaged in group fights, and raped women. After liberation, they still refused to bow their heads and confess their crimes to the people, attempting to restore feudal forces. For example, Ba Yanqing, a traitor, special agent, local tyrant, and head of a large porter gang, sold opium, set up gambling dens, and ran rampant in the Hebei Avenue area of the city for 17 years, cruelly exploiting workers. He also served as the branch president of the Japanese puppet Xinminhui, assisting the Japanese invaders in oppressing the people. After the Japanese surrendered, he more actively engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, serving as a puppet National Assembly representative, a supervisor of the bandit Party Headquarters, and a standing committee member of the bandit Pacification Committee. During the "June 2nd" student anti-hunger parade, Ba Bandit led his followers to block the students' parade, beat and arrested them, causing a major bloodshed. After liberation, he did not repent, colluding with porter gang leaders to sabotage worker organizations. Another example is Zhai Chunhe, the head of a porter gang who ran rampant for 20 years, exploiting 44% of the workers' wages through the "2-8 deposit, 3-7 split account" method, and raping female entertainers Li Jinfen, Xi Cailing, Jin Ronghua, Wang Suqiu, and others. Jing Yijiang (nicknamed Jing San), a traitor, local tyrant, and special agent, often persecuted workers, accusing them of "colluding with the Eighth Route Army" and using torture to force confessions while serving as a company commander in the Japanese puppet army and a special agent in the intelligence office of the bandit "Pacification Commissioner's Office." He also raped many women, cruelly raping Fan Zhang's wife and then forcibly raping her 14-year-old daughter, forcing an abortion after she became pregnant. After liberation, Jing Bandit still did not repent, concealing his identity as a special agent, harboring and releasing bandit officers.

There were also principal figures who used reactionary Taoist sects to spread rumors, mislead the public, rape women, defraud people of their property, and attempt to organize reactionary armed forces. For example, Wang Ziquan, the head of the "World New Buddhist Church," colluded with major traitors Wang Yitang, Chu Minyi, and Japanese invaders war criminals Okamura Neiji during the Anti-Japanese War, doing intelligence work for the Japanese invaders and taking advantage of the enemy's power to plunder the people's wealth. After the Japanese surrendered, he colluded with Chiang bandit special agent heads Hao Yulin, Chen Xianzhou, and others to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. After the liberation of Tianjin, Wang Bandit still did not repent, spreading rumors and sabotage, claiming "ten thousand religions return to one," calling himself "Zhong Huangtian," and attempting to organize an armed rebellion. Li Yukun was the head of Yiguandao, a Dian Chuan Shi, using the Taoist sect to engage in counter-revolutionary activities in Tianjin, Hangzhou, and other places, establishing more than 50 altars such as "Xingshi" and "Zhongyi" in Hangzhou alone. Around 1944, he colluded with Japanese puppet traitors to establish the Bai Shizi Hui, a peripheral organization of Yiguandao, in Tianjin, defrauding people of their property. After liberation, Li Bandit also harbored bandits.

A group of traitors and habitual bandits who surrendered to the Japanese invaders, betrayed the motherland, ganged up to rob, and cruelly harmed the people were also executed at the same time. For example, Gao Tiehou, nicknamed "King Yama Gao," killed more than 60 people. Zhang Tianpei, who came from the puppet army, led the Japanese invaders in attacking the liberated areas several times, killing 18 of our soldiers, and later served Chiang bandits, personally injuring three of our military personnel.

After the sentences were announced on the morning of the 31st, these counter-revolutionary criminals were taken to the execution ground in batches and executed by firing squad. The Military Control Commission Military Law Office of Tianjin Municipality had widely posted announcements in the urban area, detailing the list of criminals and their crimes.

　　接受各界人民的控诉和要求       
    天津枪决一批反革命罪犯
    【新华社天津二日电】天津市军事管制委员会军法处接受本市各界人民的控诉和要求，依据惩治反革命条例于三月三十一日枪决了一批反革命罪犯。
    在处决的反革命分子中，有一大批是长期作恶，破坏革命工作，镇压工人及学生运动，负有重大血债的首恶分子。如一贯残害工人破坏工人运动著名大工贼苑宝璜，他在日寇投降后充任匪天津市党部执行委员、伪国大代表及匪总工会常务理事，把持伪天津市总工会，镇压工人运动。一九四八年天津市电车工人罢工时，他先指示其爪牙以手枪威胁工人，又勾结匪军警以装甲车堵住公司门口，逮捕工人杜宝礼等九人。据其自供，类此事件，他先后作过三十五次之多。制造“潘家峪大血案”的大特务朱世荫，曾带领日寇屠杀我人民一千二百人，烧毁房屋千余间，使该村人烟断绝，全村化为瓦砾。美蒋特务曹强，充天津市匪稽查处处长时，正值一九四六年“和平谈判”期间，他指示其属下搜查我驻天津办事处，逮捕我干部。同年，杀害我被俘战士四名，更与美海军陆战队情报处勾结，搜集我方情报。后调济南主持特务工作，曾捕害我干部和无辜人民六十余人。灭绝人性的特务郭永图，是潜伏特务组织“军事联络组驻天津联络处”的主任，曾先后率领匪军进攻我解放区四十余次，伤害我革命人员百余名。他更灭绝人性地剖食我革命人员的心脏又以活埋淹溺等非刑杀害我工作人员六名，村干部四名。
    另一批是怙恶不悛的特务分子，他们都是日、伪、美蒋特务出身，解放后拒不登记，继续作反革命活动，或供给敌人情报，或潜入我机关、工厂、学校内部进行破坏。如孙福锐、李仲諟等原都是日伪军官，后又转任蒋匪军政要职，曾暗杀我革命干部赵云洛等五人，村干部多人，又组织土匪潜入我解放区刺杀革命干部。解放后，孙、李等组织匪“平津冀热区党政军调查处”，受蒋匪特务头子张庆恩的指挥，活动于北京天津两市，在天津市开设启大古玩店和酱油房作掩护，窝藏并放走大特务头子刘钊，并勾结留用职员郭晏廷刺探我国家机密。刘礼达是国民党区分部委员，又是“忠义普济社”特务，解放后隐瞒反动身份，潜伏在海河工程处修理厂内，曾破坏过该厂的最大马达。赵鸿雁、徐凤翙是以天主教为掩护的蒋匪特务组织“天津民众建国协进会”的首要分子，他们计划打入我机关工厂学校内部进行暗杀，更企图建立反革命武装。中统特务陈绪绵、白景云等解放后潜伏铁路部门，阴谋破坏，曾几次损毁机车，破坏行车安全，并曾企图烧毁机车。
    另一批处决的特务是自台湾潜入的匪徒，和解放后勾结特务建立反动组织，进行反革命活动的特务分子。如朱锐、王思炽、董铨卿等是受蒋匪特务头子郑介民亲自指挥的特务组织“中华人民反共救国军第二十九纵队”的要犯。他们企图建立海上基地，在海上因船只损坏，临时化装难民，妄想登陆潜伏，乘机作乱。军统特务刘金镛受台湾蒋匪命令潜入华北，建立通讯网，刺探我部队的装备和兵力布置。崔桐起、范玉和是匪“直属国防部二厅反共青年救国队”要犯，负责在铁路局内进行破坏工作。一九四九年九月曾将东站电源总闸拉开，使全站停电七分钟，并偷摄配电盘的照片，企图进行爆炸。
    有一批是恶霸脚行头杀人犯，他们多年剥削工人，压迫市民，设赌群殴，奸淫妇女，在解放后仍然不向人民低头认罪，妄图恢复封建势力。像汉奸特务恶霸大脚行头子巴延庆，曾贩卖白面，设立赌局，横行本市河北大街一带，残酷剥削工人十七年，并曾充任日伪新民会分会长，协助日寇压榨人民。日寇投降后，更积极进行反革命活动，历充伪国大代表，匪党部督导员及匪戡乱委员会常务委员等。“六·二”学生反饥饿大游行时，巴匪曾率领徒众阻拦学生游行，殴打逮捕，造成大血案，解放后不知悔改，勾串脚行头，破坏工人组织。又如横行二十年的脚行头翟春和，用“二八存款，三七劈账”的方式剥削工人工资的百分之四十四，强奸女艺人李金芬、喜彩苓、金荣花、王素秋等多人。汉奸恶霸特务井义江（浑名井三），在充任日伪军连长及匪“绥靖公署”谍报处特务时，经常迫害工人，指为“勾通八路”，酷刑逼供。他又奸淫过很多妇女，曾残忍地将范张氏强奸后，又将其十四岁幼女强行奸污，怀孕后又强迫坠胎。解放后，井匪仍不悔改，隐瞒特务身份，窝藏和放走匪军官。
    还有是利用反动道会门，造谣惑众，奸淫妇女，诈欺民财，并企图组织反动武装的首恶分子。如“世界新佛教会”的头子王紫泉，在抗日期间曾与大汉奸王揖唐、褚民谊及日寇侵华战犯冈村宁次勾结，为日寇作情报工作，并借敌势搜刮民财。日寇投降后，复与蒋匪特务头子郝玉林、陈仙洲等勾结一起进行反革命活动。天津解放后，王匪仍不知悔改，造谣破坏，扬言“万教归一”，自称“中皇天”，企图组织武装暴动。李育坤是一贯道道长，点传师，在天津、杭州等地利用道门进行反革命活动，仅杭州一地就成立了“醒世”、“忠一”等坛五十余处。一九四四年间，勾结日伪汉奸在天津成立一贯道外围组织白十字会，诈欺取财。解放后，李匪并窝藏匪徒。
    投降日寇，背叛祖国，结伙行抢残害人民的一批汉奸、惯匪也同时伏法。如外号“高阎王”的高铁侯，杀过六十多条人命。伪军出身的张天培，曾引导日寇几次进攻解放区，杀害我战士十八名，后又为蒋匪效力，亲手伤害我军人员三名。
    这些反革命罪犯，在三十一日上午宣判后分批绑赴刑场执行枪决。本市军事管制委员会军法处曾在市区普遍张贴布告，详列各犯名单及罪状。
