　　Model Worker Xu Luomo Returns to Village After Graduating from Agricultural University to Promote Agricultural Technology
    Improve Agricultural Technology and Ensure a Bumper Harvest of Cotton and Grain!
To the Editor:

    Since Xu Luomo, a labor model from Beipengjia Village, Jin County, Hebei Province, returned home after studying agricultural technology at Beijing Agricultural University for seven months last year, his house has often been crowded with farmers who come to learn agricultural techniques from him. Xu Luomo explained to everyone the role of the three essential fertilizer elements: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. He pointed out that the cotton planted in the north of the village in previous years had very lush leaves but did not produce many cotton bolls. This was because there was too much nitrogen and too little phosphorus in the soil. If some bone meal fertilizer were used, this could be remedied. Many farmers listened to him and were willing to buy bone meal as fertilizer. Based on the amount everyone requested, 5,000 jin of bone meal was not enough.

    Xu Luomo also mobilized everyone to separate the firewood ashes from the stove from urine and manure to prevent them from losing their potency when mixed together. Some people felt this was too troublesome, but after his repeated explanations, several households have prepared to separate them.

    Last year, the village bought more than 1,000 jin of tobacco leaves to treat cotton aphids. This year, tobacco leaves are too expensive, so Xu Luomo led the farmers to manufacture solid cotton oil emulsion to treat cotton aphids. Initially, everyone did not believe it, and no one wanted to try it first. Xu Luomo first persuaded the farmer Zhang Laokai, and the two of them jointly bought eighteen jin of cotton oil. Then, he mobilized everyone to invest shares, with one share equivalent to one jin of oil. In this way, twelve farming households invested shares. During the production process, Xu Luomo personally taught everyone. He mixed cotton oil, hemp seeds, millet flour, etc., in a basin, placed it on the heated kang (platform bed), and stirred it daily to let it ferment into a solid. Many farmers ran to see it every day. After three days, because the cotton oil was heated on the kang, it became thinner. Everyone anxiously said, "Xu Luomo, why is this thing getting thinner and thinner? Are you afraid you misheard in Beijing?" But by the ninth day, the cotton oil emulsion became thick, and with the addition of alkali, it became soap blocks - solid cotton oil emulsion.

    Xu Luomo, together with the village head and the Communist Party branch secretary, actively led everyone to turn dry land into paddy fields and expand cotton fields. They organized six production teams and borrowed six waterwheels from the county water conservancy promotion agency as early as the sixth day of the first lunar month. As of the end of the second lunar month, the village had borrowed a total of twenty-two waterwheels. They led everyone in digging three new wells and deepening four old wells, expanding the paddy fields by more than 150 mu. To expand the cotton fields, they also brought back 800 jin of pure Sizi No. 4 cotton seeds from the county farm.

    The mutual aid group led by Xu Luomo has already challenged the Li Shunda mutual aid group. The cotton planted by their group is guaranteed to produce 377 jin of seed cotton per mu, and the dry land is guaranteed to produce 150 jin per mu.

    Because farmers frequently ask Xu Luomo for agricultural technology, he is now preparing to find enthusiastic farmers to organize a technical research group.

### 提高农业技术，保证棉粮丰收！  劳动模范许洛墨农业大学毕业后  回村宣传农业技术

　　劳动模范许洛墨农业大学毕业后
    回村宣传农业技术
    提高农业技术，保证棉粮丰收！编辑同志：
    河北省晋县北彭家庄村劳动模范许洛墨，自去年在北京农业大学学习农业技术七个月回家后，屋子里经常挤满了来向他学习农业技术的农民。许洛墨向大家讲解肥料三要素氮、磷、钾的作用。他指出本村村北的地，往年种的棉花，叶子长的很茂盛，棉桃结的不多，这是因为地土里氮素多，磷素太少，如果用些骨粉肥料，就能治过来。很多农民听了他的话，都愿买骨粉做肥料。根据大家所提出来的数目，五千斤骨粉还不够。
    许洛墨还动员大家，把烧灶火的柴草灰单另放起来，免得和尿、大粪混在一起，弄得没劲了。有些人觉得这样太麻烦，经过他再三解释，已有几户准备分开放了。
    去年，本村曾买了一千多斤烟叶治棉蚜虫。今年烟叶太贵，许洛墨就领导农民制造固体棉油乳剂来治棉蚜虫。开始大家不相信，谁也不愿先作。许洛墨先说动了农民张老开，他俩合伙买了十八斤棉油。然后动员大家入股，一股算一斤油。这样一来，就有十二户农民入股。在制作时，许洛墨亲自教给大家。他把棉油、大麻仁、小米面等在盆里配合好，放在坑头上，每天搅拌，让它发酵后变成固体。很多农民天天跑来看。三天过去，因为棉油放在炕头上着了热，却变稀了。大家着急地说：“许洛墨，为什这东西越来越稀？怕是你在北京听错了吧？”可是到第九天，棉油乳剂变稠了，放上碱，就成了皂块——固体棉油乳剂。
    许洛墨和村长、中共支部书记等，积极领导大家把旱田变成水田，扩大棉田。他们组织了六个生产组，正月初六，就从县水利推进社贷回六辆水车。截至夏历二月底，全村已贷回二十二辆水车。他们领导大家，打了三眼新井，又把四眼旧井锥深，扩大水田一百五十多亩。为了扩大棉田，又从县农场拉回八百斤纯斯子四号棉籽。
    许洛墨所领导的互助组，已向李顺达互助组应战。他们组种的棉花，保证每亩产籽棉三七七斤，旱地每亩产一五○斤。
    因为经常有农民向许洛墨求教农业技术，他现在正准备找热心的农民，组织一个技术研究组。
