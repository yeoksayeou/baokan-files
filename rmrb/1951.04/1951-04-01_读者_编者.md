Two Suggestions for Uniformity in Translation

Reader Wu Gonghua suggests two points for uniformity in translation: First, all foreign names and place names, except those that have been used for a long time and are widely known, should in principle "follow the pronunciation of the owner," and be transliterated according to their native pronunciation. If necessary, a literal translation can be added to avoid the common practice of using English or Russian pronunciation for translation. Second, the abbreviation of names in translations should not use foreign letters. Many books and periodicals use English or Russian letters for abbreviated names, which is very inconvenient. It should be the practice, as in "Yue·Sidalin" (Joseph Stalin) and "An·Yang·Weixinsiji" (Andrey Vyshinsky), to use the first syllable to replace the first letter. If the first syllable cannot be pronounced, it is better to have the last name without the first name. We believe that these two opinions are correct. In view of the many confusions in current translations, it is really necessary to use such simple and universal principles to unify them.

About the Revised Edition of *Ciyuan*

Many readers have sent letters and articles criticizing the explanations of certain terms in the revised edition of the *Ciyuan* dictionary published by the Commercial Press, pointing out that most of the entries related to political and realistic topics are explained incorrectly or inappropriately. One reader even suggested that the publisher stop selling it.

The revised edition of *Ciyuan* does have shortcomings. In the third issue of this newspaper on January 21st of this year, we pointed out that "there are still incomplete and incorrect shortcomings in the explanations of some nouns." But today we do not have a more complete and comprehensive reference book, so critically using the revised edition of *Ciyuan* is still necessary. We suggest that the Commercial Press carefully accept the opinions of readers that have been published in the newspaper and those that we will continue to forward, and revise some of the wrong, inappropriate, or incomplete entries in the revised edition of *Ciyuan*. Temporarily print inserts to be distributed with the revised edition, and send them free of charge to readers who have already purchased the book as a remedy. In addition, further revisions should be considered to meet the requirements of readers.

Copyright Issues

According to the Workers' Publishing House, Zhao Shuli's *Shi Bu Lan Gan Che* (Stone Isn't Rotten Drives the Cart) was originally agreed to be published by them, but the Northeast Branch of Xinhua Bookstore preemptively published it on its own. Later, the Shanghai People's Press reprinted it. *Ruci Meiguo* (So This is America) was also published by them, but Sanlian Bookstore reprinted it. The Workers' Publishing House expressed its opinion: This not only "causes economic losses to publishers and authors, but also makes it difficult to correct errors in the version, which is detrimental to the publishing industry." We hope that all publishers will respect the copyright of others, and should not reprint the publications of one publisher without obtaining the consent of that publisher.

            译名统一的两点建议
    读者吴公华对译名统一建议两点：一、一切外国人名地名除习用已久，众人皆知者外，一概采“名从主人”原则，按照其本国读法音译出来，必要时可附以义译，避免目前常见的用英文或俄文发音去译的办法。二、译名上的名字简写一概不用外国字母，许多书刊上人名简写都用英文字母或俄文字母，很不方便，应当一概仿“约·斯大林”，“安·扬·维辛斯基”之例，用第一个音段来代替第一个字母，如果说不出第一个音段，宁可有姓无名。我们认为这两个意见都是正确的，鉴于目前译名上的许多混乱，实在要用这样简单而能通用的原则，加以统一。
            关于《辞源》改编本
    有很多读者来信、来稿，对商务印书馆《辞源》改编本若干名词解释提出批评，指出其中有关政治性及现实性的条目大都解释错误或欠妥。有一位读者甚至提议要求出版者停售。
    《辞源》改编本的缺点是有的。在本年一月二十一日本刊第三号上，我们就曾指出它“在有些名词的解释中，还存在着不完全和不正确的缺点”。但今天我们还没有一部更完善的、综合性的工具书，那么批判地使用《辞源》改编本也还有其必要。我们建议商务印书馆细心接受报纸上已经发表的和我们陆续转去的读者的意见，将《辞源》改编本中若干错误的、不妥的或不完全的条目，加以修改，暂时附印插页，随改编本发行，并无偿寄送已购该书的读者，作为一个补救。另外也应该考虑进一步的改编修订，以符合读者的要求。
            版权问题
    据工人出版社反映：赵树理著《石不烂赶车》，原和作者约定由他们出版，新华书店东北总分店抢先自行出版了，随后又由上海人民书报社翻印，《如此美国》也是他们出版的，三联书店又拿来翻版了。工人出版社提出意见：这样做，不只使出版家和著作家的“经济权益受损失，且使版本讹误难于纠正，对出版事业是不利的”。我们希望一切出版家们尊重别人的版权，在没有取得一个出版家的同意时，不应该把这一出版家的出版物拿来重印。
