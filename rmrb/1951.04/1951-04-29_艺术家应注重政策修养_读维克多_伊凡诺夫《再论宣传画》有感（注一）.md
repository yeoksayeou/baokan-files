　　Artists Should Focus on Policy Cultivation
　　——Reflections on Reading Viktor Ivanov's "More on Propaganda Posters" (Note 1)
　　Liao Hua
    Viktor Ivanov, a propaganda artist who has twice won the Stalin Prize, is one of the painters in this Soviet art exhibition in Beijing who attracted my attention the most. His works such as "The Great Stalin is the Torch of Communism," "For the Happiness of the People," and "Mothers of All Mankind Fight for Peace" are all works that have left a deep impression on me (Note 2). Now, after reading his essay "More on Propaganda Posters," I have a better understanding of the reasons why Viktor Ivanov and other Soviet propaganda artists (Note 3) have achieved such brilliant success. What is the reason?
    Any Chinese artist who has read this essay can understand from it that Viktor Ivanov has a very good grasp of the characteristics (or one might say, the laws) of propaganda posters. For example, the appeal of propaganda posters depends not only on the text, but also on the picture itself. In composition, it is necessary to select the most important things, so that the audience's attention is focused on the most essential things, thus forming the simplicity of the work and producing a strong appeal. In order to be suitable for distant audiences, the image must be easy to see clearly and easy to understand, so as not to be a blur. Avoid separating the text and the artistic image, focus on the attractiveness of the form, and closely link the audience with the propaganda poster, and if necessary, make the posture and line of sight of the characters in the painting face the audience. Oppose formalism, oppose only pursuing good looks, oppose looking to weak and fashionable color photography when one should strongly use brush and ink, and oppose "handicraft"-style calm processing of all details, not for the unity of thought and form, the unity of form and content. These are not empty theories, but theories that have been confirmed by the creative practice of an artist who came from an art school and has worked on propaganda posters for more than ten years.
    Are these theoretical principles of creation the main conditions for the success of propaganda posters? No. As a more important condition for propaganda posters and even other works of art, one should seek it from his experience. If we want to learn from Soviet propaganda artists, the main thing is not to learn their composition, coloring, and brushwork. It is certainly not formal imitation. The main thing should be to learn how they grasp the theme of propaganda posters, and only then, under this premise, how to earnestly seek appropriate methods of expression.
    Viktor Ivanov opposes the general saying: "Their (propaganda artists') works 'reflect' a certain aspect of our reality, a certain achievement of the Soviet system." He believes that the theme of propaganda posters should be an appeal to the tasks of the struggle in reality. As the essence of propaganda posters, it should be looking forward, it should be for the "future." This argument is very much in line with the spirit of socialist realism. The characteristic of socialist realism is not mainly to critically reflect reality, not to simply explain the process of the development of things, but to see the direction of the development of reality, and to emphasize subjective initiative, guiding the people to fight for reasonable ideals. It is obviously not enough to simply explain the process of the development of things without guiding the people on how to deal with reality. The propaganda artist himself must see the contradictions in reality, grasp the tasks of the struggle in a certain period, and call on the people to strive to change objective reality. The author believes:
    "Political propaganda posters are tools for mobilizing the Soviet people. Its mission is not only to reflect reality, but also to emotionally influence the masses, unite the feelings, thoughts, and will of the Soviet people. It should contain a direct call to action."
    After giving the example of "We Conquer Drought," which is in line with this task, the author put forward serious criticisms of some works that flatly record phenomena and cannot produce a calling effect. These criticisms are also worth the vigilance of some Chinese writers. He said:
    "If someone asks them to paint a propaganda poster about sowing, then they will paint a few collective farm members working in the fields. What does this give to the collective farmers who see this painting? You should know that the farmers know more about how to sow than the painters do" (this does not refer to educational propaganda posters that promote some new things in agriculture)."
    In our propaganda posters and New Year pictures, there are examples similar to "We Conquer Drought," and there are also examples of this kind of flat recording of phenomena.
    Viktor Ivanov put forward opinions on the method of expressing the theme of sowing: he opposes treating the picture as a "passive decoration and 'bait' for slogans." Rather, the picture should also produce the political purpose of reminding the masses of what must be done and why. In order to conform to the purposefulness of propaganda posters, when expressing the theme of sowing, one can point out its results - fertile fields, mountains of grain, and improved living standards.
    Yes, Viktor Ivanov is talking about the issue of creative methods here. But it is more than just the issue of creative methods. "How to express" is subordinate to "what to express." He does not regard creative methods in isolation from the theme. Serious propaganda artists understand very well that not only must they think more and find more materials at work, but they must also constantly and deeply study life, so as to obtain themes that conform to looking forward or facing the future, and thus choose and create concrete images that fit this theme. What standards should be used to study life? What is the criterion for distinguishing which things should develop or represent the "future"? Although Viktor Ivanov did not fully explain it in this article, it is very clear that writers must study and master policy. When policy has become the writer's yardstick for distinguishing in which direction things will develop and how they should develop, he can correctly understand life, feel the occurrence and development of new things, and distinguish what is representative of the reality of life. Moreover, only in this way can the "old routine" of expression be effectively overcome in creation, and a fresh and lively image be formed. Only in this way can it be clearly decided what is worth emphasizing, and a concise image be formed. Only in this way can one not only rely on the words in the picture, but also express the theme through the image at the same time. Only in this way can one consciously judge whether the form and content are unified, and avoid leaving the content and simply pursuing "good-looking" forms. Only in this way can one avoid the predicament of "rushing to complete tasks," and be able to complete a better work in a few days of work time, as Viktor Ivanov said. Why do policy and life have such a significant impact on propaganda posters and even all artistic creations? It would take many pages to discuss this in detail. However, as long as we can seriously study the relationship between policy and life, as long as we can actively participate in the anti-imperialist patriotic movement, land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and other revolutionary practices, we can fully understand the origin and role of policy, so as to correctly judge what should be described. When the purpose of "what to describe" is clear, we can then stipulate the methods of "how to describe" and judge the gains and losses of propaganda posters in terms of expression methods. If one does not understand policy and treats revolutionary struggles coldly and detachedly, then one cannot obtain a theme with positive significance, nor can one fundamentally measure the gains and losses of expression methods. Then it is possible to repeat the shortcomings of failing to concentrate on reflecting the people's aspirations and repeat the mistakes of distorting reality (that is, violating policy).
    Individual young friends have seen the high artistry of Soviet propaganda posters and simply believe that this is due to the excellence of the basic skills of sketching, and thus decided to strengthen their sketching studies. (Although he is already focusing on learning sketching.) This is obviously a misguided view. It is certainly right to learn from Soviet propaganda artists, but if one ignores the question of what should be focused on learning, one cannot improve one's professional level. (Although we cannot despise the training of skills.) Under the leadership of Stalin, Viktor Ivanov's insightful theory once again illustrates the correctness of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy, and the correctness of the path taken by outstanding Chinese painters. Artists must seriously study the policies of the Communist Party, and works that can correctly reflect policies are becoming more widespread.

　　艺术家应注重政策修养
　  ——读维克多·伊凡诺夫《再论宣传画》有感（注一）
　　廖华
    两次荣获斯大林奖金的宣传画家维克多·伊凡诺夫，是这一次在北京举行的苏联画展中最引起笔者注意的画家之一。他的《伟大的斯大林是共产主义的火炬》、《为了人民的幸福》、《全人类的母亲们为和平斗争》等等，都是给我印象很深的作品（注二）。现在读了他的论文《再论宣传画》，更了解了维克多·伊凡诺夫和其他苏联宣传画家（注三）获得如此辉煌的成就的原因。这原因是什么呢？
    凡是读过这篇论文的中国美术家，都可以从中了解：维克多·伊凡诺夫非常掌握得住宣传画的特性（也可以说是规律）。比如说：宣传画的号召力量不仅取决于文字，而且更是取决于图画本身。在构图时要挑选最主要的东西，使观众的注意力集中在最本质的东西上面，因而形成作品的简洁，产生强大的感染力。为了适应远距离的观众，必须使形象容易看得清楚，容易看懂，而不至于模糊一团。避免文字和美术形象分家，着重造形的吸引力，把观众与宣传画紧密地联结在一起，必要时使画中人物的姿式和视线朝向观众。反对形式主义，反对只图好看，反对应该强烈地使用笔墨时也向软弱的时髦的彩色照像看齐，反对不是为了思想与造型的统一，形式与内容的统一，而对所有细节都给予“手工业”式的平心静气的加工。这些，都不是空论，而是出身于美术学校、干了十多年宣传画工作的美术家，从创作实践中得到证实了的理论。
    这些创作方法上的理论，是不是宣传画能够成功的主要条件呢？不是。作为宣传画以至其它艺术品的更重要的条件，应该从他这篇经验谈中去寻求。如果说要向苏联宣传画家学习，主要的不在于学习他们的构图、设色和用笔。更绝不是形式的抄袭。主要的，应该是学习他们如何掌握宣传画的主题，其次才是在这一前提之下，如何认真地寻求适当的表现的方法。
    维克多·伊凡诺夫反对一般的说法：“他们（宣传画家）的作品‘反映’了我们现实的某一方面，苏维埃制度的某种成就。”他认为：宣传画的主题应该是对于现实的斗争任务的一种号召。作为宣传画的本质，应该是向前看，应该是为了“未来”。这一论点十分符合社会主义现实主义的精神。社会主义现实主义的特点，主要不在于批判地反映现实，不在于单纯地说明事物发展的过程，而在于看得出现实的发展方向，并且强调主观能动性，引导人民为着合理的理想而斗争。单纯地说明事物发展过程而不引导人民如何对待现实显然是不够的。宣传画家自己必须看得出现实的矛盾之所在，掌握得住一定时期的斗争任务，号召人民去为变革客观现实而努力。作者认为：
    “政治宣传画是动员苏维埃人民的工具，它的使命不但是反映现实，而且更加要在情感上影响群众，团结苏维埃人们的感情、思想和意志。它应该含有对一定行动的直接号召。”
    作者举出符合这一任务的例子“我们战胜旱灾”之后，紧接着对于某些平板地记录现象、不能产生号召作用的作品，提出了严正的批评。这些批评，同样值得中国有些作家警惕。他说：
    “假如人家请他们画一幅关于播种的宣传画，那末，他们就画几个在农田上工作的集体农庄庄员。这对于看这幅画的集体农民给了些什么呢？要知道：如何进行播种，农民比画家内行得多”（这里不是指宣传农业中某种新东西的教育性的宣传画而言）。”
    在我们的宣传画以及年画中，有类似“我们战胜旱灾”的例子，也有这种平板记录现象例子的。
    维克多·伊凡诺夫对于播种的主题的表现方法提出意见：反对把图画当成“口号的被动的装饰和‘诱饵’”。而要使图画也能产生提醒群众必须做什么和为什么要这样做的政治目的。为了符合宣传画的目的性，在表达播种这一主题的时候，可以指出它的结果——丰饶的田垄，如山的谷物和生活的提高。
    是的，在这儿维克多·伊凡诺夫谈的是创作方法问题。但也不止于创作方法问题。“如何表现”服从“表现什么”，他没有孤立地脱离主题来看待创作方法。严肃的宣传画家十分懂得：不仅在工作时要多想多找材料，而且必须经常深刻研究生活，从而获得符合向前看或面向未来的主题，从而选择和创造切合这一主题的具体形象。用什么标准来研究生活呢？什么是辨别那一些事物应该发展或代表“未来”呢？维克多·伊凡诺夫虽然没有在这一篇文章里充分说明，但很显然，作家必须研究和掌握政策。当政策已经成为作家辨别事物将要向那一方向发展应该如何发展的标尺时，他才能够正确地认识生活，感得到新鲜事物的发生和发展，区别什么才是具有代表意义的生活现实。而且，只有如此，才能在创作上有效地克服“老一套”的表现方式，形成形象的新鲜活泼。只有如此，才能明确地决定什么是值得着重描写的东西，形成形象的简洁。只有如此，才能不只依赖图中的文字，而能够同时借形象来表达主题。只有如此，才能够自觉地判断形式和内容是否统一，避免离开内容而在单纯地追求“好看”的形式。只有如此，才能避免“赶任务”的窘状，才能如同维克多·伊凡诺夫所说，几天的工作时间也能够完成一件较好的作品。为什么政策和生活对于宣传画以至一切艺术创作有如此重大的作用呢？详细谈起来将要许多篇幅。可是，只要我们能认真研究政策与生活的关系，只要我们能够积极参加反帝国主义爱国运动、土地改革、镇压反革命等等革命实践，就可以充分的理解政策的来历与作用，从而正确判断应该描写什么。“描写什么”的目的明确了，就可以进而规定应该“如何描写”的方法和判断宣传画在表现方法上的得失。如果不懂得政策而且冷淡地超然地对待革命斗争，那就不能获得具有积极意义的主题，也不能从根本上衡量表现方法的得失。那就可能重复不能集中地反映人民愿望的缺点和重复歪曲现实（即违反政策）的错误。
    个别青年朋友看了苏联宣传画的高度艺术性，而单纯地认为这由于素描基础的高明，因而决定加强素描学习。（虽然他已经在着重地学习素描。）这显然是舍本逐末的看法。向苏联宣传画家学习当然是对的，但是，如果忽略了应该着重学习什么的问题，也不能提高自己的业务水平。（虽然我们不能轻视技术的磨练。）在斯大林领导下，维克多·伊凡诺夫精辟的理论，再一次说明了毛主席文艺方针的正确，和中国优秀画家所走的道路的正确。艺术家必须认真学习共产党的政策，已经能够正确反映政策的作品更加普遍。
