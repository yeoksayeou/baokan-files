Shanghai Newspapers Fight to Unfold Criticism and Self-Criticism
Shanghai Municipal People's Government News Publication Department

　　Editor's note: This article summarizes the experiences of Shanghai newspapers in unfolding criticism and self-criticism from May to December 1950, a period of eight months. Although the material is somewhat old, it is still worth referencing. It is very helpful for news publication administrative organs to make such a summary of various aspects of news publication work in a certain period, in order to improve the quality of news publication work, and this is also a method that should be learned.

　　Achieved Certain Results

　　Shanghai newspapers have already achieved great results in criticism and self-criticism. These achievements are mainly manifested in the following three aspects: (A) Helping the government to examine work, correct work, and rectify the work style of leading cadres. For example, last year, the Jiefang Daily criticized the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory (July 27), the Asia Steel Factory (June 26), the Yisheng Enamel Factory, the Shanghai Municipal Trade Trust Company (September 5), the Ta Kung Pao criticized the China Textile No. 11 Factory, the China Textile Printing and Dyeing No. 3 Factory, the Wusong and Qiujiang state-owned machine factories, the Xinjing District Takeover Committee Zhou Hongwu, the Xinwen Daily criticized several professional companies of the East China Trade Department, the People's Court, the Wenhui Daily criticized the Yushan Station of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, and the Luwan District Branch Fifth Branch of the Shanghai Public Bonds Promotion Committee; all of these received the attention of the leadership, and those who were criticized mostly accepted the criticism, conducted self-criticism, and corrected their mistakes. In addition to helping government agencies and organizations improve their work, this work also enhanced the government's prestige. (B) Strengthening the connection between newspapers and the masses, thereby enhancing the prestige of newspapers as important tools for propaganda and education. (C) Educating the readers, which is to say, raising the level of political awareness of the readers. The reader letters initially received by newspapers were mostly limited to job requests and trivial matters in life, but soon turned to concerns about politics, the current situation, and public events; even immature or small criticisms and suggestions, at least proved that the letter-writing masses were gradually able to jump from the individual circle to the social circle, from concrete small things to a principled height; this also proved that the national news work conference's policy on this issue was correct.

　　The reasons for achieving these results are, first, due to the strong support of the Party and the government. After the CCP Central Committee's decision on unfolding criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government's instructions on unfolding criticism and self-criticism in newspapers were announced, the municipal government held a cadre meeting on May 20 last year, in order to educate the cadres of subordinate units. The responsible leaders personally reported on the significance of criticism and self-criticism, and pointed out some deviations that had occurred in some units in dealing with criticism and self-criticism, as well as how to understand criticism, examine mistakes, and improve work. Afterwards, the responsible comrades of each bureau and office also made separate transmission reports, educating subordinate cadres to earnestly implement it. On May 23, the News Publication Department convened a symposium of responsible persons of various newspapers and major editors and reporters, and Vice Mayor Pan Hannian personally spoke, explaining the importance of criticism and self-criticism. This symposium was of great educational and enlightening significance to general journalists. Later, in the rectification movement, the responsible comrades conducted severe criticism and self-criticism based on the materials published in the newspapers.

　　Secondly, due to the hard work and energetic promotion of the various newspapers. After the National Journalism Conference, there had been a change in the thinking of journalists, so for the newspapers of Shanghai after liberation, criticism and self-criticism was a new task, and there was no prior experience. In the process of carrying out the work, they encountered some obstacles, but they were not intimidated by the obstacles. For example, the Jiefang Daily's criticism of the Shanghai Cooperative Supply and Marketing General Cooperative Coal Briquette Factory on June 13, the Ta Kung Pao's criticism of the yarn factory union and the Xinjing District Takeover Committee, and the Xinwen Daily's criticism of the East China Trade Department were resisted by those criticized, who used minor discrepancies in wording and facts as excuses. Because these criticisms were fundamentally correct, the principle of criticism and self-criticism was finally upheld under the resolute correction of the leadership. The above experience also proves that unfolding criticism and self-criticism in newspapers is itself a process of ideological struggle and ideological education that adheres to principles. Without this struggle and education, the conditions for the smooth development of this work cannot be obtained.

　　Several Experiences

　　In the past eight months, with the diligent research of newspaper workers, the newspapers have gained the following experiences, which are indispensable for better completion of the work.

　　1. Methods of Conducting Criticism and Self-Criticism. According to the reports of various newspapers, the following cautious and appropriate methods are generally adopted to carry out the work:

　　1.  Regarding the handling of readers' critical manuscripts, reporters or comrades handling readers' letters are generally sent to investigate, or the letters are forwarded to relevant agencies and organizations, and then the letters and investigation results or self-criticisms are published simultaneously.

　　2.  More important manuscripts are published on the news page or the local news page, and secondary or unimportant ones are placed on the social service page or the supplement. Individual newspapers also publish commentaries along with important critical manuscripts, raising them to a principled height and strengthening the policy and ideological nature of the critical events.

　　3.  For departments or individuals whose self-criticism is incorrect or not sincere, the editors add comments behind the published manuscripts, adhere to principles, and help them correct their mistakes.

　　4.  For those who ignore criticism or delay responses, actively take the method of public prompting, or send letters to urge them. Sometimes, readers' opinions are adopted to publicly demand responses.

　　5.  When encountering problems that are not easy to solve, contact the leading agencies and ask for assistance in solving them. (However, this method is rarely used.)

　　2. Reader Letter Editors' Symposium. In order to exchange experiences and study ways to solve difficulties, the editors of the social service groups of various newspapers have organized regular symposiums since June, once a month, and invited comrades from the news authorities to participate. This symposium is helpful in understanding each other's situation, exchanging work experience, and overcoming difficulties.

　　3. Correspondents Played a Role. After liberation, the newspapers realized the mistake of running newspapers behind closed doors in the past, and gradually attached importance to the organization of correspondents. Generally speaking, the Jiefang Daily attached more importance to this work, and was able to better connect with the masses, rely on the masses, and grasp this policy, so the correspondents it organized were also more numerous. In addition to providing news and news clues, they also provided a large number of critical manuscripts. When some newspapers held correspondents' symposiums, they also reported on the issue of criticism and self-criticism, and mobilized them to conduct criticism and self-criticism in the newspapers. The situation in Shanghai is that newspapers with well-organized correspondent networks also carried out criticism well.

　　4. Layout Adjustment. In order to carry out criticism and self-criticism, the newspapers all allocated social service pages within their original space to publish the criticisms and suggestions of the masses, which became a page that was of concern to and loved by the broad masses of readers. Later, in order to gradually improve the work of criticism from trivial matters, the newspapers began to merge the social service pages with the original supplements. The four major newspapers in Shanghai have now done this, such as the "Jiefang Supplement" of the Jiefang Daily (Editor's note: changed to "Reader Letters" from March 2 this year), the "Dagong Park Land" of the Ta Kung Pao, the "Reader Garden" of the Xinwen Daily, and the "Social University" of the Wenhui Daily. During the layout adjustment, there were concerns within the newspapers. For example, at the beginning, there were also concerns within the Ta Kung Pao about merging the social service page with the supplement, thinking that this might affect sales, but in fact, after the merger, readers only felt uncomfortable for the first few days, and there was no special reaction. However, from the perspective of the entire connection with the masses, the space used by the newspapers in this regard is still somewhat small.

　　The above four experiences were all obtained by the newspapers after going through a stage of exploration and creation, and all played a certain role.

　　Difficulties and Shortcomings

　　The achievements and experiences of carrying out criticism and self-criticism in newspapers are summarized above. However, some problems and difficulties were also encountered in the work. According to the situation we obtained from the reports and symposiums of various newspapers, in addition to many who humbly accepted criticism and worked hard to improve their work, there are still many who are criticized who resist self-criticism with the following different attitudes:

　　1. Adopt a bureaucratic attitude towards criticism, either reject it completely, or seize on some factual inaccuracies in the criticism as an excuse to refuse to accept the correct parts, such as the Xin Feng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, a comrade from the state-owned Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory, and the second criticism of the No. 12 National Cotton Factory (all of the above are seen in the Jiefang Daily).

　　2. Accept it on the surface, delay in making changes or take a perfunctory attitude, such as the criticism of the Qiujiang Machine Factory and the Shanghai Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry Union's criticism of the native products company's medicinal materials group, which yielded no results (see Jiefang Daily). Some accept it on the surface, and also say that they will punish the working comrades who have made mistakes, but whether they have been punished or not, there is no follow-up.

　　3. Individual agencies or organizations have had the phenomenon of rejecting criticism, threatening newspaper workers, and attempting to suppress criticism. Such as the "fatigue bombing" of the person in charge of the East China Trade Department to the person in charge of the Xinwen Daily interview department, and the insult of the person in charge of the yarn factory union to the reporter of the Ta Kung Pao. Also, after the Xinwen Daily criticized a certain paper mill, the capitalists mobilized backward workers to make noise and investigate the source of the news. The Ta Kung Pao published an untrue criticism that a middle school teacher suffered from lung disease and affected the health of students, and the comrades of the Education Bureau actually attempted to go to the newspaper to check the original manuscript (which did not happen), and did not realize that newspapers should be protected and assisted when conducting reporting work and publishing critical manuscripts. If it does not match the facts, it can be corrected or sued.

　　4. Some agencies deal with reporters in a perfunctory manner after criticism and block the news.

　　5. Some leading agencies do not pay enough attention to criticism. After receiving the critical letters forwarded by the newspapers, they forward the letters down level by level, and finally the reply forwarded to the newspapers is "According to the report of a certain district (township)...", without expressing any responsible opinions of their own, as if this incident has nothing to do with them at all.

　　6. Some agencies only reply or explain the problem, and do not conduct in-depth self-criticism.

　　7. The phenomenon of delaying responses or not replying at all to the reader letters forwarded by the newspapers is quite common. According to the report of the Xinwen Daily, the People's Court of this city cannot quickly reply to the reader letters forwarded by the newspaper, or even does not reply at all. According to the latest statistics, 28 letters were forwarded in October, of which 17 were replied to, and 11 were not replied to. In November, 15 letters were forwarded, 6 were replied to, and 9 were not replied to. Later, the newspaper directly sent a letter to the court, requesting a general explanation, but the result was still not replied to. Delaying the reply is in fact equivalent to not replying. Because the critical event has passed two or three months, the masses' impressions have faded, and even disappeared. Bringing up the old matter again cannot satisfy the readers, and the newspaper also has no need to publish it.

　　Naturally, there are also many shortcomings in the work of newspaper editors and reporters in carrying out critical work and grasping the measure of criticism:

　　1. Some newspapers have too few staff members to handle reader letters. For example, the Ta Kung Pao initially had only two (the main work was still borne by one person), and the Wenhui Daily had only one. Although it has increased later, they still feel overwhelmed in the busy affairs of dealing with reader visits and handling manuscripts, so they do not have time to consider problems, formulate plans, or even find time to make summaries. Due to the limitations of manpower, the following series of problems have occurred.

　　2. Editors carelessly delete and modify manuscripts, resulting in phenomena that do not completely match the facts. For example, when the Jiefang Daily handled the case of Wu Helin, a local bully in Pudong, abusing his wife to death, it mistakenly changed "trial" to "retrial" and "seduction" to "rape", causing dissatisfaction from the court. Individual reporters are not humble enough in interviews, do not grasp the key points of the facts, or ask one-sided questions, and lack analysis of the background and causes of the shortcomings and errors, so that those who are criticized cannot be convinced.

　　3. They do not trust the readers, suspect that the criticism is 100% correct, and cannot send out more working comrades to investigate themselves. The result of such excessive caution is that they dare not criticize major events, and criticize minor events more.

　　4. They lack regular contact with various agencies and do not understand what their central work is at a certain stage, so the criticisms published cannot hit the nail on the head, resulting in a phenomenon of scratching an itch from outside the boot.

　　5. The inspection work is not done well. Usually, the sent letters are counted, whether there is a reply or not, but there is no inspection, and there is no timely supervision. It is also unclear whether the work of the criticized agencies has improved.

　　6. Individual newspapers cannot persist in criticism, and often change the letters that they subjectively believe should be published publicly due to the other party's opinions.

　　7. The common feeling of newspapers is that handling manuscripts falls into a passive state. Whatever manuscripts readers send, they publish. The editors cannot proactively organize manuscripts from readers around one or several central issues within a certain period of time, so that key criticisms and general criticisms can be well coordinated. For example, when the government called on the masses to do a good job in winter defense and all sectors enthusiastically responded to the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to defend the country, the reflection in the newspapers was abstract and empty, and the work of correcting deviations and errors was very insufficient.

　　8. After September, the number of reader letters received by the newspapers gradually decreased. In addition to the gradual improvement of the situation, the gradual resolution of the citizens' difficult problems and ideological concerns, and the fact that the criticism did not gradually expand to depth and regularity, resulting in fewer submissions, the main reason should be said to be our above-mentioned attitude of resisting criticism and the insufficient efforts of newspaper staff to enlighten readers to contact readers, which is the most important reason. Obviously, we must break through this link in order for the work to go deeper and persist.

　　The Road to Improvement in the Future

　　The movement of criticism and self-criticism is constantly developing and has gained widespread attention. The shortcomings that have occurred on both sides, the criticizer and the criticized, have occurred in the development process of the work, and should be overcome, and must be overcome. In order to further advance the criticism and self-criticism unfolded in the newspapers, we believe that it is necessary to pay attention to achieving the following points:

　　1. It is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the editorial boards of the newspapers on criticism and self-criticism. Generally speaking, the responsible persons of the editorial departments of the newspapers have a clearer understanding of the local situation at that time, and a more comprehensive understanding, while some editors, due to the limitations of their level and the nature of their work, often cannot grasp the overall situation, so they cannot find the key to the problem, hit the nail on the head, and even make deviations when conducting criticism. Working comrades must actively strengthen contact with various agencies and organizations, participate in various symposiums, understand the situation of each agency and the current work center, and critical manuscripts must be closely integrated with the current central work, otherwise they cannot produce a positive and effective role.

　　2. The editors of reader letters must get out of the circle of passively dealing with trivial matters in the past, flexibly use reader groups and correspondent networks, and turn to proactively organizing manuscripts from readers. Readers' submissions often follow the direction expressed on the newspaper pages. Some newspapers receive a flood of reader submissions criticizing public utilities because there are many manuscripts criticizing public utilities. Some newspapers publish more answers on medicine and health, so reader letters are mostly limited to asking about illnesses and medicines. Trivial matters are not without value. We must realize that they are a manifestation of big problems. If we can find the internal connections between many small problems that seem trivial on the surface, and combine them with the current central work, publishing them in the newspapers will definitely be welcomed by readers, and it will be easy to raise the masses from trivial matters to big problems, and raise them from their level of experience to principles. Editors should proactively grasp the work center of each period and adjust the layout, and cannot wait for reader letters to decide the central content.

　　3. It must be understood that the purpose of unfolding criticism and self-criticism in newspapers is to improve work. Therefore, the criticism of newspapers must implement the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and carry out a persistent and resolute struggle against bad tendencies. For the vague shirking of responsibility of some staff members of certain agencies, it is necessary to get to the bottom of it. Incorrect attitudes must be corrected. Delays and neglect should be criticized. When necessary, contact should be made with the leadership to speed up the resolution of the event, or it should be announced in the newspapers (this itself is a kind of criticism). Criticism, self-criticism, and improvement of work are inseparable processes. Criticism and self-criticism are not enough. It is necessary to investigate whether the criticized person has improved their work. In order to carry out regular and effective efforts, the manpower of the newspapers to handle reader letters must be strengthened.

　　4. In order to unfold criticism and self-criticism in a led and planned way, the news publication administrative organs must take on the task of promoting and actually leading. In the past, the editors of reader letters of various newspapers had great expectations for the News Publication Department, but because of our own weakness and insufficient attention to this work, we did not provide much specific help, so except for some efforts in the initial stage of unfolding, most of the time we let the newspapers explore on their own. This is one of the reasons for the spontaneity of the criticism and self-criticism movement. In the future, we must carefully study the content and working methods of the reader letter pages of various newspapers, distinguish the correct and inappropriate parts from them, and then summarize them into principled conclusions, and then combine them with the current central work to guide the newspapers to further and regularly carry out the criticism and self-criticism movement.

　　5. In the coming period, the most important central work of the people of the whole country is the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to defend the country. The newspapers have already done some work in propaganda and reporting, but it is not deep enough, and it is far from being a household name, and it has not been closely coordinated in terms of criticism and self-criticism. It must be recognized that resisting US aggression and aiding Korea is a long-term movement, and whether we do well or not in this regard is related to the fundamental and greatest interests of the people. The editors of reader letters of various newspapers should focus on this work, and the responsible persons and all staff members of various newspapers should also take this as the center, organize reader manuscripts, and check the specific and practical work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea in various aspects through the masses, point out its shortcomings, correct its mistakes, and fight against all thoughts and actions that are harmful to the movement of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to defend the country, so that criticism and self-criticism can be further improved.

### 上海各报为展开批评和自我批评而斗争

　　上海各报为展开批评和自我批评而斗争
    上海市人民政府新闻出版处
    编者按：本文总结了上海各报一九五○年五月至十二月八个月中在展开批评和自我批评方面的经验。材料虽然稍旧了一些，但是很值得参考。新闻出版行政机关在一定时期对新闻出版工作的各个方面作出这样性质的总结，对于提高新闻出版工作质量很有作用，这也是应当学习的一个方法。
  获得了一定的成绩
    上海各报在批评和自我批评方面，已经获得了很大的成绩。这种成绩主要表现在以下三方面：（甲）帮助政府检查工作，改正工作和纠正领导干部的作风上面。例如去年解放日报批评了上海电机厂（七月二十七日），亚细亚钢铁厂（六月二十六日），义生搪瓷厂，上海市贸易信托公司（九月五日），大公报批评了中纺十一厂、中纺印染三厂、吴淞、虬江两国营机器厂、新泾区接管委员会周洪武，新闻日报批评了华东贸易部几个专业公司、人民法院，文汇报批评了上海铁路局玉山站、上海公债推销委员会卢湾区分会第五支会；凡此都受到领导方面的注意，被批评者大都接受了批评，进行检讨，纠正错误。这一工作除了帮助机关团体改进了工作之外，还提高了政府的威信。（乙）加强了报纸与群众之间的联系，从而提高作为宣传教育重要工具的报纸的威信。（丙）教育了读者群众，也就是提高了读者政治认识的水平。报纸最初所收到的读者来信中，大多是限于求职问事以及生活上的琐屑小事，但是不久就转到对政治、对时局、对社会公众事件的关切上来了，即使是不成熟的或者是小事情的批评与建议，至少证明了投书的群众已能逐渐从个人的圈子跳到社会的圈子，从具体的小事情提高到原则性的高度；这也证明了全国新闻工作会议对这个问题的方针是正确的。
    获得这些成绩的原因，首先是由于党和政府的大力支持。中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定和上海市人民政府关于在报纸上展开批评和自我批评的指示公布之后，市府为了教育所属单位的干部起见，在去年五月二十日举行干部大会，由负责首长亲自报告批评和自我批评的意义，并指出若干单位在对待批评和自我批评时所发生的偏向，以及怎样来认识批评，检讨错误，改进工作。事后各局处的负责同志并分别作了传达报告，教育所属干部认真执行。五月二十三日，新闻出版处邀集各报负责人及主要编采人员举行座谈会，由潘汉年副市长亲临讲话，说明批评和自我批评这个工作的重要性。这次座谈会对一般新闻工作者的教育启发意义甚大。以后在整风运动中，负责同志曾根据报纸所刊的材料进行了严厉的批评和自我批评。
    其次，由于各报纸的努力宣传和努力工作。全国新闻工作会议以后，新闻工作者的思想上已有转变，因此，对于解放后的上海的报纸，批评和自我批评虽是一件新的工作，事先亦毫无经验，在工作进行过程中且曾遭遇到若干阻碍，但他们并没有被阻碍所吓倒。例如六月十三日解放日报对上海合作供销总社合作煤球厂的批评，大公报对纱厂工会和新泾区接管委员会的批评，新闻日报对华东贸易部的批评，被批评者以文字与事实的小有出入为借口，公然抵抗批评，由于这些批评在基本上是正确的，最后终于在领导方面坚决纠正之下，维护了批评和自我批评的原则。以上的经验也证明了：在报纸上展开批评和自我批评，本身就是一个坚持原则的思想斗争和思想教育的过程，没有这一斗争和教育，这个工作是无法获得顺利发展的条件的。
  几点经验
    八个月来，在报纸工作者的虚心研究下，各报已经获得了下列一些经验，这样的经验是更好地完成工作所不可少的基础。
    一、进行批评和自我批评的方法。根据各报的报告，大体采用以下的几种谨慎而妥善的办法来进行工作：
    １、处理读者的批评稿件，一般是派记者或处理读者来信的工作同志前往调查，或者把来信转往有关机关团体，然后以来信和调查结果或检讨同时刊登。
    ２、比较重要的稿件刊登在要闻版或本市新闻版，次要的或不重要的则放在社会服务版或副刊。个别报纸对重要的批评稿件并配合言论发表，提高到原则高度，加强批评事件的政策性和思想性。
    ３、对于检讨不正确或不虚心不认真的部门或个人，编者在发刊的稿件后面加上按语，坚持原则，帮助其纠正错误。
    ４、对批评者不理，或拖延答复的，主动采取公开催问的办法，或者去信催促。有时采用读者的意见，公开要求答复。
    ５、遇到不易解决的问题，就与领导机构联系，要求协助解决。（但这一种方法还很少采用。）
    二、读者来信编者座谈会。为了交流经验，研究解决困难的办法起见，各报社会服务组的编者自六月份起组织了定期的座谈会，每月一次，并邀请新闻主管部门的同志参加。这个座谈会在彼此了解情况，交流工作经验，以及克服困难等方面都是有帮助的。
    三、通讯员起了作用。解放以后各报都认识到过去闭门办报的错误，而逐渐重视通讯员的组织工作。一般地说，解放日报比较重视这一工作，而且也能较好地联系群众，依靠群众，掌握了这方针，所以所组织的通讯员也比较多。他们除了供给新闻与新闻线索外，也供给了大量的批评稿件。有些报纸在召开通讯员座谈会时，还报告了批评和自我批评问题，并动员他们在报纸上进行批评和自我批评。上海的情形是：凡通讯员网组织得好的报纸，批评也开展得好。
    四、版面的调整。为了开展批评和自我批评工作，各报都在原有篇幅内划出了社会服务版，刊登群众的批评与建议，而且成为广大读者关切爱读的一版。后来为了使批评工作逐渐由琐屑小事加以提高，各报开始把社会服务版和原有的副刊合并。上海四个主要大报现在都是这样做了，如解放日报的《解放副刊》（编者按：已于本年三月二日起改为《读者来信》）、大公报的《大公园地》、新闻日报的《读者园地》、文汇报的《社会大学》。在版面调整时，报纸内部曾经有过顾虑，例如大公报内部在开始时对社会服务版与副刊合并也曾有顾虑，认为这样做了可能影响到销路，但事实上合并之后除了使读者在最初几天感觉到不习惯外，并没有特殊的反响。但是从整个联系群众来看，各报在这方面所用的篇幅还是少了一些。
    以上四点经验，都是各报经过了摸索创造的阶段才获得的，而且都曾起了一定的作用。
  困难和缺点
    在报纸上进行批评和自我批评的成绩和经验概如上述。但在工作中还遇到一些问题和困难。据我们在各报的报告和座谈会中得到的情况，一般被批评者除了不少虚心接受批评，努力改进工作的以外，尚有不少被批评者，仍旧以如下几种不同的态度，抗拒自我批评：
    一、对批评采取官僚主义态度，或者全部拒绝，或者抓住批评中部分失实之处作为借口而拒绝接受正确的部分，如新丰染织厂，国营上海绢纺厂某同志，对国棉十二厂的二次批评等即是（以上均见解放日报）。
    二、表面接受，拖延不改或者采取敷衍态度，如批评虬江机器厂、上海市参燕业工会批评土产公司药材组事件，均无结果（见解放日报）。有的表面接受，而且说要对犯了错误的工作同志予以处分，但到底处分了没有，便没有下文了。
    三、个别机关或团体曾有拒绝批评，威胁报纸工作者，企图压制批评的现象。如华东贸易部负责人对新闻日报采访部负责人的“疲劳轰炸”，纱厂工会负责人对大公报记者的侮辱。又新闻日报对某纸厂进行批评后，该厂资方便发动落后工人前往吵闹，并追究新闻来源。大公报刊载某中学教师患肺病影响学生健康的不实批评，教育局的同志竟企图前往报馆查阅原稿（未成事实），而没有认识到，报纸在进行报道工作及发表批评的稿件时，应受到保护协助，如果不符事实，可以提出更正，起诉。
    四、有些机关在批评后以敷衍态度对付记者，把消息封锁起来。
    五、有些领导机关对批评不够重视，在接到报馆转去的批评函件后，便把信件逐级往下转，最后转往报馆的答复便是“据某某区（乡）报告……”，而自己不表示一点负责的意见，仿佛这事件与他们完全无关似的。
    六、有的机关仅就问题答复或解释，不深入检讨。
    七、对于报馆转去的读者函件拖延答复或根本不复的现象相当普遍。据新闻日报的报告，本市人民法院对报馆转去的读者函件，就不能很快答复，甚至不答复，据最近的统计，十月份转去函件二十八件，其中十七件有答复，十一件未复，十一月份转去十五件，六件有答复，九件未复。后来该报曾直接去函法院，要求有一个总的交代，结果还是未复。拖延答复事实上等于不复。因为批评的事件经过两三个月时间，群众的印象已经淡薄，甚至消失，旧事重提，已不能使读者满意，而报纸也无刊登的必要了。
    自然，报纸编辑、记者在进行批评工作及掌握批评分寸上也存在着很多缺点：
    一、有些报纸处理读者来信的工作人员太少，如大公报在开始时只有两位（主要的工作还是由一个人负担的），文汇报只有一位，后来虽然增加了，但在应付读者访问，处理稿件的繁忙事务中还是觉得应接不暇，因此便没有时间来考虑问题，拟具计划，甚至连作总结的时间也抽不出来。由于人力的限制，便发生了以下一连串的问题。
    二、编辑改稿时粗枝大叶地删改，致有与事实不完全相符的现象发生。如解放日报在处理浦东恶霸吴鹤林虐杀其妻案把“审判”误为“重审”，“诱奸”误为“强奸”，引起法院方面的不满。个别记者在采访中不够虚心，对所举事实抓不住要害，或者提得片面，对缺点错误产生的背景原因缺乏分析，致有时不能使被批评者心悦诚服。
    三、对读者不信任，怀疑批评是否百分之百正确，而自己又不能派出更多的工作同志出去调查。这样过分谨慎的结果，便是大事不敢批评，小事多批评。
    四、与各机关缺少经常的联系，不了解其在某一阶段的中心工作是什么，以致刊出的批评不能击中要害，发生隔靴搔痒的现象。
    五、检查工作做得不够，通常发出的信件有统计，是否有答复，便没有检查，也没有及时督促。对于被批评机构的工作有无改进，也不清楚。
    六、个别报纸不能坚持批评，主观上认为应予公开发表的信件，常因对方意见而改变。
    七、报纸共同的感觉是处理稿件陷于被动，读者来什么稿件就登什么稿件，编者还不能在一定的时期内环绕着一个或几个中心问题主动地向读者组织稿件，使重点批评和一般性的批评很好配合起来。例如政府在号召群众做好冬防工作以及各界热烈响应抗美援朝保家卫国运动时，报纸上的反映是抽象的，空洞的，对于纠正偏向错误的工作做得非常不够。
    八、九月份以后，各报所收到读者来信逐渐减少，这除了因为情况逐步好转，市民疑难问题思想顾虑逐渐解决，以及批评并未逐步扩大转到深入与经常方面，以致来稿较少以外，主要应当说是我们上述的这种抗拒批评的态度以及报纸工作人员所作的启发读者联系读者的努力不够，乃是最重要的原因。很显然的，我们必须突破这个环节，工作才能深入及坚持下去。
  今后改进的道路
    批评和自我批评运动正在不断开展之中，且已获得了普遍的重视。批评者与被批评者双方所发生的缺点，都产生在工作的发展过程中，应该是可以克服的，而且是必须克服的。为了把报纸上展开的批评和自我批评向前推进一步，我们认为必须注意作到下列几点：
    一、必须加强各报编委对于批评和自我批评的领导。一般地说，各报编辑部的负责人对于当时当地的情况了解比较清楚，更了解全面，而部分编辑同志则由于水平与工作性质的限制，常常不能掌握全面的情况，因而在进行批评时不能找出问题的关键，击中要害，甚至发生偏差。工作同志必须主动的加强与各机关团体的联系，参加各种座谈会，了解各该机关的情况以及当前的工作中心，批评稿件必须密切结合当前的中心工作，否则就不能产生积极有效的作用。
    二、读者来信的编者必须由过去被动的应付琐碎小事的圈子里脱身出来，灵活运用读者小组与通讯网，转到主动地去组织读者的稿件。读者的来稿常常是跟着报纸版面上所表现的方向走的，有的报纸因为批评公用事业的稿件多，读者批评水电交通的稿件就雪片飞来，有的报纸因为刊载医药卫生的解答较多，读者来信便大部限于问病问药。琐屑小事并非是毫无价值的，我们必须认识到它是大问题表现出来的一面，如果能从许多表面上看来是琐屑的小问题中间，发现其内在的联系，并结合起当前的中心工作，在报纸上发表出来，一定能为读者欢迎，而且容易把群众从琐事提高到大问题上去，从他们的经验水平提高到原则上去。编者应主动掌握各个时期的工作中心，调整版面，而不能等待读者来信，再来决定中心内容。
    三、必须理解：在报纸上展开批评和自我批评的目的是为了改进工作，因此报纸的批评必须贯彻批评和自我批评的精神，与不良倾向作持久的坚决的斗争。对于某些机关的某些工作人员的含糊推诿，必须追根究底，不正确的态度必须纠正，拖延不理应加批评，必要的时候应该与领导方面取得联系，加速事件的解决，或者在报纸上予以公布（这件事本身就是一种批评）。批评、检讨和改进工作是不可分的过程，有了批评和检讨还是不够，必须追究被批评者有没有改进工作。为了进行经常的有效的努力，各报处理读者来信的人力必须加强。
    四、为了有领导地有计划地展开批评和自我批评，新闻出版行政机关必须负起推动和实际领导的任务。各报读者来信的编者过去对新闻出版处的期望很大，但因我们本身力量的薄弱以及对这一工作的重视还有不够，具体帮助不多，因此除了在开始展开的一个阶段曾有所努力外，大部分的时间是听任各报自己摸索的。这是造成批评和自我批评运动自流的原因之一。今后我们必须审慎研究各报读者来信版的内容和工作方法，从中区别出正确的和不妥当的部分，然后综合归纳为原则性的结论，再结合当前的中心工作，指导各报进一步地经常地开展批评和自我批评运动。
    五、今后一个时期，全国人民最重要的中心工作是抗美援朝保家卫国运动，各报在宣传报道上已经做了一部分工作，但还不够深入，距离家喻户晓的程度还差得很远，而表现在批评和自我批评方面的还未密切配合。必须认识到抗美援朝是一个长期的运动，我们在这方面做得好或者不好，关系着人民根本的最大的利益。各报读者来信编者应该把重心放在这一工作上面，各报负责人及全体工作人员也应以此为中心，组织读者的稿件，通过群众来检查各方面的抗美援朝的具体的实际工作，指出其缺点，纠正其错误，与一切有害于抗美援朝爱国运动的思想行动作斗争，才能使批评和自我批评更向前提高一步。
