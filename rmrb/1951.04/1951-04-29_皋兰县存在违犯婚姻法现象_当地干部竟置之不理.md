    Gao Lan County Exhibits Violations of Marriage Law; Local Cadres Ignore the Situation

    To the Editors:

    The Marriage Law has been promulgated and implemented for a year, but the masses and cadres in the villages of Gao Lan County, Gansu Province, still do not attach importance to it. In Qijiapo Village, Qijiapo Township, the villager Shi Keqin forced his thirteen-year-old daughter to marry. His daughter died forty days after the marriage. Xu Dezhong of the same village, in order to have a grandson early, allowed his thirteen-year-old son to marry an eighteen-year-old woman. Family relations became very strained after the marriage. In Yangjiashan Village, in the same township, Yang Daoyou's marriage was arranged by his parents. However, the woman has a mental illness and makes a lot of noise at home all day long. Yang Daoyou is very dissatisfied, causing discord in the family, and the whole family has no interest in production.

    When these things happened, the Working Group of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was working in the township. After the comrades of the working group heard the masses' reports, they did not educate the masses; some comrades even said: "It is better to do less than to do more." Township cadres also adopted an irresponsible attitude of "not hearing, not asking, not reporting, and not paying attention." We hope they will review and correct this.

### 皋兰县存在违犯婚姻法现象  当地干部竟置之不理

    皋兰县存在违犯婚姻法现象
    当地干部竟置之不理编辑同志：
    婚姻法公布施行已经一年了，但在甘肃省皋兰县乡村里，群众和干部对此还很不重视。该县祁家坡乡祁家坡村，村民史克勤强迫他十三岁的女儿结婚。婚后四十天，他女儿就死了。该村徐德忠为了要早抱孙子，就让他十三岁的男孩和一个十八岁的妇女结婚。婚后家庭关系闹得很不好。该乡党家山村杨道有，由家长包办结了婚。但是女方有神经病，整天在家里胡打乱闹。杨道有很不满意，弄的家庭不和，全家无心生产。
    在这些事情发生时，中共甘肃省委会工作团正在该乡工作。工作团的同志听到群众反映后，也不向群众进行教育；个别同志甚至说：“多一事不如少一事。”乡干部对此也采取“不闻不问，不报不理”的不负责态度。对此，希望他们检讨改正。
