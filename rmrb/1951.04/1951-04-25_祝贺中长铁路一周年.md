　　Congratulating the First Anniversary of the China Changchun Railway
　　Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways of the Central People's Government

　　April 25th marks the first anniversary of the establishment of the China Changchun Railway Corporation and the China Changchun Railway Administration. Allow me, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, to extend my greetings to all comrades working on the China Changchun Railway. I thank all the Soviet comrades, headed by Comrades Yelogov and Grunichev, for faithfully embodying Marshal Stalin's great friendship and making outstanding contributions to the China Changchun Railway. I extend my congratulations to all the staff and workers of the China Changchun Railway for their glorious achievements over the past year!

　　In the year since its establishment, the China Changchun Railway has played a significant role in the development of friendly and mutually beneficial relations between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union and in the advancement of China's railway construction. The comrades of the China Changchun Railway have faithfully implemented the instructions of the governments of China and the Soviet Union to build the China Changchun Railway into a model railway of China before its handover. The Soviet Union's advanced railway management methods have been gradually and systematically implemented or are being implemented on the China Changchun Railway. Production and financial plans have been developed, and the economic accounting system has begun to be implemented. Efforts have been made in all aspects, such as surveying personnel, checking standards, and assessing work skills, to improve efficiency and reduce costs, while also paying attention to labor protection and improving the lives of employees.

　　In various fields such as transportation, commerce, locomotive, rolling stock, engineering, telecommunications, planning, statistics, factory management, finance, materials, revenue, personnel, education, wages and working hours, livelihood, and health, advanced technical operation methods and scientific work systems of Soviet railway management have been introduced and implemented. All have proven effective, and some have been promoted to other railways in China.

　　The transportation tasks assigned to the China Changchun Railway by the state have been overfulfilled, and profits have been made. The China Changchun Railway has played a significant role in supporting the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea.

　　China's railways have been advancing rapidly in recent years. This is due to the victory of the Chinese Liberation War, the support of the Chinese people, the joint efforts of all the staff and workers of the Chinese railways, and the assistance of Soviet experts and the acceptance of advanced Soviet experience. China's economic development requires China's railways to continue to move forward. This year, we will focus on implementing economic accounting on Chinese railways and prepare to implement it universally in all administrative bureaus across the country next year. This means there is much work to be done, and various technical operations must be continuously improved. It is clear that this problem can only be effectively solved by fostering the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers and combining it with the systematic study of advanced Soviet experience in railway management. It is hoped that all comrades of the China Changchun Railway will take on the role of leader, backbone, and bridge, combining advanced Soviet experience with China's specific conditions. After the results are achieved on the China Changchun Railway, they should be systematically and promptly disseminated to other railways in China. Much has already been summarized, disseminated, and reflected in the past year, and it is hoped that more will be done in the future. Other Chinese railways should also send cadres in a planned and organized manner to regularly and specifically study certain aspects of the work. This is an extra burden on your work, and teaching them is the glorious responsibility of the comrades of the China Changchun Railway.

　　Chinese comrades working on the China Changchun Railway, you must continue to unremittingly and even more highly promote your enthusiasm and creativity, and systematically and in a more organized way learn from Soviet comrades in all aspects, actively introduce the situation, actively raise questions, and learn each piece thoroughly, learning complete sets of experiences. One of the conclusions from your summary of learning Soviet experience last year was that where the study of advanced Soviet experience is taken seriously, the work is active and progress is rapid. The China Changchun Railway has more than a thousand Soviet experts, and they are also working together in the field on a daily basis. This environment is rare. One year has already passed, and although there is still more than a year left, the time is not very long. The state requires you to learn completely, so that when we manage the model railway during the period of joint Sino-Soviet management ourselves, we can continue to manage it in a model way. This is the glorious task of all Chinese comrades of the China Changchun Railway. You must spare no effort to fulfill the government's requirements of you, that is, to highly promote your enthusiasm and creativity, and to honestly and earnestly learn from the Soviet comrades who are working together.

　　The development and progress of the China Changchun Railway demonstrate the development and progress of the friendly and mutually beneficial relations between China and the Soviet Union. Let us wish the China Changchun Railway a model completion of the state tasks this year, the promotion of a series of advanced experiences in Soviet railway management, and the continuous and greater dissemination of the experience gained in combination with China's conditions to the national railways. We must use our glorious work results to powerfully support the victorious struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea. I wish the China Changchun Railway even greater success this year, and I wish the comrades good health!

　　Long live the unity of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union!
　　Long live the world's peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!
　　Long live the great People's Republic of China!
　　Long live the Communist Party of China!
　　Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!
　　Long live Marshal Stalin, the teacher of the working people of the world!

　　祝贺中长铁路一周年
    中央人民政府铁道部部长　滕代远
    四月二十五日是中长铁路公司、中长铁路管理局成立一周年的纪念日，让我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府，向中长路全体工作的同志们致慰问。感谢以叶洛果夫与格鲁尼切夫同志为首的全体苏联同志，忠诚地体现着斯大林大元帅伟大的友谊，在中长路上给了卓越的贡献。对中长路全体职工一年来的光辉成绩表示祝贺！
    中长路成立一年内，对中苏两大民族友好互助关系的开展，对中国人民铁道建设事业的前进，是有着重大作用的。中长路的同志们，忠实地执行着中苏两国政府，在移交前把中长路办成中国模范铁路的指示。苏联先进的管理铁路的方法，逐步地有系统地在中长路实行着或实行了。有了生产财务计划，开始实行经济核算制。从各方面，如查定员、查标准、考工等，提高效率，降低成本，同时注意了劳动保护及改善职工生活的工作。
    在车务、商务、机务、车辆、工务、电务、计划、统计、厂务、财务、材料、进款、人事、教育、工资工时、生计、卫生等各方面，介绍和实行了苏联铁路管理先进的技术作业方法，及科学的工作制度。且都已行之有效，有些已向中国其他铁路推广。
    国家所给予中长铁路的运输任务，已经超额完成了，并取得了利润。在支援抗美援朝的战争中中长路是起了巨大作用的。
    中国人民铁道几年来在迅速地前进着，这是由于中国解放战争的胜利，中国人民的支持，中国铁路全体职工的共同努力，并得到了苏联专家的帮助和接受了苏联先进经验的结果。中国的经济发展要求中国铁路继续向前进，我们今年要在中国铁路上重点实行经济核算，并准备明年在全国各管理局普遍实行，这样就有许多工作要做，在各种技术作业方面也要不断提高。很清楚，只有以发扬广大职工的积极性和创造性为基础，与系统地学习苏联管理铁路的先进经验相结合，才能有效地解决这一问题。希望中长路全体同志们担负起带头、骨干、桥梁作用，把苏联先进经验与中国具体情况相结合，在中长路产生效果之后，立即有系统地及时地向中国其他铁路传播。过去一年内已经总结传播和反映了不少，今后还希望更多一些。中国其他铁路还要有计划有组织地派干部来，定期地分类地学习某些工作，这是你们工作外的负担，教会他们是中长路同志们光荣的责任。
    在中长路工作的中国同志们，你们要继续不懈地更高地发扬你们的积极性和创造性，并从各方面更要有计划地有组织地向苏联同志学习，主动地介绍情况，积极地提出问题，一件一件地学透彻，学会成套的经验。你们去年八个月学习苏联经验总结中有一条，那里学苏联先进经验认真，那里工作就活跃，进步就快。中长路有一千多位苏联专家，又是日常相处于现场实际工作中，这个环境是难得的。已经过去一年了，虽还有一年多，时间并不是很长的，国家要求你们完全学会，把中苏共管时的模范铁路，当我们自己管时，要能继续模范地管理下去，这是中长路全体中国同志的光荣任务。你们要不遗余力地实现政府对你们的要求，那就是高度地发扬你们的积极性和创造性，老老实实地向一道工作的苏联同志认真学习。
    中长铁路的发展和前进，表现着中苏两国友好互助关系的发展和前进。让我们预祝中长铁路今年模范地完成国家任务，推广苏联铁路管理一系列的先进经验，并不断和更多地把结合中国情况取得的经验，向全国铁路传播。要拿我们光辉的工作成果，来有力地支援抗美援朝胜利的斗争。预祝中长路今年有更大的成功，并祝同志们健康！
    中苏两大民族的团结一致万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营万岁！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
    世界劳动人民的导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
