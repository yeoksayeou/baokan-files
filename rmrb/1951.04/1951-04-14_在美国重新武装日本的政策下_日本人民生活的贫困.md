　　Under the American Policy of Rearming Japan
    The Impoverishment of the Japanese People
    The United States is stepping up the rearmament of Japan, preparing to expand its war of aggression. This is a new disaster directly threatening the Japanese people.
    The recent passage of the 1951 budget案 by the Japanese Diet is entirely in the service of American war preparations and rearmament. Of the total expenditure of 657.42 billion yen, a large portion is used for military spending. This includes 102.7 billion yen for so-called "occupation costs" to be used by the United States to build military bases and maintain the occupying forces stationed in Japan, 16 billion yen for the "Police Reserve Force" to arm the Japanese army, and more than 5.5 billion yen for the "Maritime Safety Agency" to arm the Japanese navy. The 110.4 billion yen for "Public Works" and 110 billion yen for "Local Fiscal Equalization Subsidies" are also actually military expenditures, a large part of which is used for military construction. In addition, 50 billion yen for the "Foreign Exchange Special Account" and 2.5 billion yen for the "Essential Materials Import Fund" are mainly to meet the needs of importing strategic materials. There are many small items hidden in this budget, all of which have a military nature, either directly or indirectly.
    The cost of rearming Japan must be borne by the Japanese taxpayers. In 1950, the average tax paid by each Japanese family was almost twelve times that of 1939. Recently, MacArthur Headquarters instructed the Yoshida puppet government to revise local tax laws, and the total amount of income tax to be collected in 1951 will increase by 28.9 billion yen compared to last year.
    Increased taxes reduce the income of the working people. In 1950, the real wages of Japanese workers were about one-third of what they were before the war. At the Mitaka Factory near Tokyo, the average monthly wage for workers is 4,000 to 5,000 yen, but they have to pay 700 yen in taxes each month. Many people in Tokyo have to sell their rationed rice to pay taxes. In some places, farmers have to pay 44 percent of their income in exorbitant taxes. Farmers are often deprived of their land by the Japanese government for failing to pay taxes.
    In addition to the exploitation of heavy taxes, the Japanese people also suffer from high prices. After the United States launched its war of aggression in Korea, it bought a large amount of materials in Japan to supply the war, causing prices to soar in Japan. By early February of this year, prices in Japan had risen by an average of about 50 percent compared to before the United States launched its war of aggression in Korea. Under these circumstances, the wages of the Japanese working people can only maintain a half-starved existence.
    Because the Yoshida puppet government is cooperating with the United States in the war of aggression against Korea, Japanese workers are suffering slave-like treatment. Workers in factories, railroads, ships, docks, and seaports controlled by the American occupying forces and its managers are constantly working under armed surveillance. In order to produce large quantities of military supplies for the American aggressors, Japanese monopoly capitalists cruelly exploit Japanese workers. Japanese workers are forced to intensify their labor, while wages are reduced. Each worker at the Asano Dockyard is forced to work 170 hours more per month without any increase in wages; while the Fuji Iron Works reduced the wages of each worker by 500 yen per month, it also increased the workload of four open-hearth furnaces. However, the most serious problem is unemployment, with the total number of unemployed and semi-unemployed workers in Japan reaching 18 million.
    This tragic picture of the lives of the Japanese people is the result of the American policy of rearming Japan and turning Japan into its military base and colony. At present, the Japanese people have not yet escaped from the disasters left over from the Second World War due to the Japanese fascist forces launching a war of aggression, and the United States is conspiring to inflict new war disasters on the Japanese people. The American conspiracy to rearm Japan will not only drive the Japanese people to serve as cannon fodder for its expanded war of aggression, but will also further increase the exploitation and extraction from the Japanese people, and the lives of the Japanese people will fall into an even more tragic situation. Therefore, the Japanese people have widely launched a struggle against rearmament and for the right to survival. The broad development of the Japanese people's struggle against rearmament is a serious obstacle to the United States' use of Japan to expand its aggression.

### 在美国重新武装日本的政策下  日本人民生活的贫困

　　在美国重新武装日本的政策下
    日本人民生活的贫困
    美国正在加紧重新武装日本，准备扩大侵略战争。这是直接威胁着日本人民的新的灾祸。
    最近日本国会通过了一九五一年的预算案，这个预算案完全是为美国备战政策服务的，是为准备重新武装而作的。在六千五百七十四亿二千万日元的岁出总额项下，有很大部分是用在军事开支上。其中包括供美国在日本建筑军事基地与维持驻日占领军之用的所谓“占领费”一千零二十七亿日元，用作武装日本陆军的“警察后备队”经费一百六十亿日元，用作武装日本海军的“海上保安厅”经费五十五亿余日元。一千一百零四亿日元的“公共事业费”与一千一百亿日元的“地方财政平衡补助费”，实际上也是军事费用，其中很大部分用于军事性的土木建筑。此外，五百亿日元的“外汇特别会计”与二十五亿日元的“紧要物资输入基金”，主要地也是为了应付输入战略物资的需要。在这个预算案中隐藏着许多小笔款项，这些款项直接或间接都具有一种军事性质。
    这些重新武装日本的费用，都要出在日本纳税人的身上。在一九五○年中，每个日本家庭平均所缴的税，几乎有一九三九年的十二倍。最近麦克阿瑟总部训令吉田傀儡政府修改地方税法，一九五一年度要征收的所得税总额，要比去年增加二百八十九亿日元。
    赋税加重，劳动人民的收入就要减低。一九五○年日本工人的实际工资约为战前的三分之一。在东京近郊的三鹰工厂里，工人每月平均工资是四千到五千日元，但每月却要缴七百日元的税。东京很多人为了缴税，连配给米也不得不拿出去卖。有的地方农民要用他的收入的百分之四十四去缴纳苛捐杂税。农民常常因为无钱纳税而被日本政府没收了土地。
    除了重税剥削以外，日本人民还受到物价高涨的痛苦。美国在发动侵略朝鲜战争以后，为了供应战争的需要，在日本大量搜买物资，致使日本物价飞涨。到今年二月初，日本的物价平均比美国发动侵略朝鲜战争以前上涨了百分之五十左右。在这种情况下，日本劳动人民的工资只能维持半饥半饱的生活。
    因为吉田傀儡政府和美国在侵略朝鲜战争中实行合作，而使日本工人遭受到奴隶般的待遇。在美国占领军的和它管理的工厂里，以及其他工厂、铁路、船只、船坞、海港工作的工人们，都是经常在武装监视下做工的。日本独占资本家为了替美国侵略者大量生产军需订货，残酷地剥削日本工人。日本工人被迫加强劳动强度，而工资却被减低。浅野船坞的每个工人每月被迫多做一百七十小时的工，但工资却没有增加；富士制铁厂一方面每月减低了每个工人的工资五百日元，另一方面却又增加四座平炉的工作。然而，最严重的还是失业问题，日本失业和半失业的工人总数已达一千八百万人。
    日本人民生活的这种悲惨景象，是美国重新武装日本、变日本为其军事基地与殖民地政策的结果。目前，日本人民尚未摆脱第二次世界大战期间由于日本法西斯势力发动侵略战争所遗留下来的灾祸，而美国竟又阴谋以新的战争灾祸加在日本人民身上。美国重新武装日本的阴谋，不仅要驱使日本人民充当其扩大侵略战争的炮灰，而且将更进一步加重对日本人民的剥削与榨取，日本人民的生活也将陷入更加悲惨的地步。因此，日本人民已广泛地展开了反对重新武装与争取生存权利的斗争。日本人民反对重新武装斗争的广大发展，正是美国利用日本进行扩大侵略的严重障碍。
