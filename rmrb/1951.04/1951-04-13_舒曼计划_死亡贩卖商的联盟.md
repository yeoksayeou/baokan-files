　　"Schuman Plan" - Alliance of Merchants of Death
　　The draft treaty of the "Schuman Plan" was signed in Paris on March 19 by the puppet governments of France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and West Germany. The "Schuman Plan" is a shameful tool for the United States to rearm West Germany, and its signing is one of the important steps taken by the United States to intensify the rearmament of West Germany. This sinister plan seriously violates the interests of the people of Western European countries and has aroused strong opposition from the people of Western European countries. The government of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on April 5, calling on the people of East and West Germany to unite with all peace-loving people of Europe to fight to defeat the sinister schemes of the imperialist warmongers.
　　On May 8 last year, French Foreign Minister Schuman held talks with US Secretary of State Acheson. The next day, Schuman issued a statement proposing that France and West Germany jointly manage coal and steel resources, advocating that "all French and German coal and steel production should be placed under a senior joint management agency," and that "this joint management agency should include an organization that welcomes the participation of all other European countries." That is to say, the coal and steel industries of France and Germany, as well as all Western European countries, should be merged into a large international trust controlled by US monopoly capital. Under the instigation of the United States, the "Schuman Plan" officially began negotiations in Paris on June 20 last year, with representatives from the puppet governments of France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and West Germany participating. Western European countries unanimously feared that the revival of the German coal and steel trust would threaten their economic foundations, and negotiations repeatedly stalled as a result. The United States hinted that it would pressure Britain to participate in the negotiations by reducing "Marshall Plan" funding, but the British government finally refused to participate because British arms merchants were particularly alarmed by the "Schuman Plan." The new alliance of Western European arms magnates resulting from the "Schuman Plan" is planning to produce 30 to 31 million tons of steel annually, while the British steel industry can only produce a little more than 16 million tons annually. In this way, the American and German magnates who monopolize the production of coal and steel in Western Europe will be able to play a greater role in the war trade than British factory owners and bankers. This also threatens Britain's market in the world. The "Schuman Plan" was negotiated for nine months, from June last year to March this year, before it was signed, which fully proves that there are serious contradictions among the Western European war blocs.
　　The "Schuman Plan" is actually a plan for the United States to plunder Western European heavy industry. The draft treaty specifically stipulates that the governments of the countries participating in the "Schuman Plan" give up sovereignty over the coal and steel industry, and under the "control" of the so-called supranational high-level agency, the coal and steel industries of the five countries and West Germany will be merged, and raw materials, markets and labor will be uniformly distributed. The United States uses the guise of the "European Unified Army" to ask Western European countries to provide it with cannon fodder for aggressive wars, and then uses the Western European coal and steel industry joint venture of the "Schuman Plan" to turn Western Europe into a European branch of the American arsenal.
　　The implementation of the "Schuman Plan" means that the coal of Western European countries will not be used for residential heating but for the production of military equipment, and steel will not be used for the production of textile and agricultural machinery but for the manufacture of guns and tanks for American aggression. As German Communist Party Chairman Lehman said, the "Schuman Plan" is an "alliance of merchants of death."
　　Although the "Schuman Plan" has been signed under the manipulation of the United States, the implementation of this treaty is still a long shot. The treaty stipulates that the coal and steel industries of France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and West Germany will be merged and operated on a "gradual" basis, and there will be a five-year "transition period" before formal implementation. This is enough to show that even the United States itself is not sure whether this sinister plan can be successfully implemented. The widespread development of the movement against the rearmament of West Germany by the people of Western European countries is a serious obstacle and blow to the "Schuman Plan."

### “舒曼计划”——死亡贩卖商的联盟

　　“舒曼计划”——死亡贩卖商的联盟
    “舒曼计划”条约草案已于三月十九日由法、意、荷、比、卢和西德傀儡政府在巴黎签字。“舒曼计划”是美国重新武装西德的可耻的工具，它的签订，是美国加紧重新武装西德的重要步骤之一。这一罪恶计划严重地违反了西欧各国人民的利益，已引起西欧各国人民的强烈反对。德意志民主共和国政府四月五日发表声明，号召东西德人民与一切爱好和平的欧洲人民联合起来，为击败帝国主义战争贩子的罪恶阴谋而斗争。
    去年五月八日，法国外长舒曼与美国国务卿艾奇逊举行了会谈，第二天舒曼就发表了一项声明，建议法国与西德联营煤钢资源，主张“全部法德煤钢的生产，均置于一高级共管机关之下”，而且“这一共管机关应包括在一欢迎其他一切欧洲国家参加的组织之内”。这就是说，要把法国与德国以及全部西欧国家的煤钢工业，均合并在一个美国独占资本控制下的大国际托辣斯里。在美国的策动下，“舒曼计划”于去年六月二十日在巴黎正式开始谈判，参加的有法、意、荷、比、卢和西德傀儡政府的代表。西欧各国一致恐惧德国煤钢托辣斯的复活会威胁自己的经济基础，谈判因此曾一再陷入僵局。美国曾暗示要以削减“马歇尔计划”拨款来压迫英国参加谈判，但是英国政府终于拒绝参加，因为英国的军火商人对“舒曼计划”特别恐慌。由“舒曼计划”而产生的西欧军火大王的新联盟，正在计划每年生产三千万至三千一百万吨的钢，而英国的钢铁工业每年只能生产一千六百万吨多一点。这样，独占了西欧煤钢生产的美国和德国的大王们，就能够在战争的买卖中比英国工厂老板和银行家起更大的作用。这也就威胁到英国在世界上的市场。从去年六月到今年三月，“舒曼计划”一直谈判了九个月才签字，这充分证明了西欧战争集团之间存在着严重的矛盾。
    “舒曼计划”实际上就是美国掠夺西欧重工业的计划。草约特别规定参加“舒曼计划”各国政府放弃对煤钢工业的主权，而在所谓超国家的高级机构“管制”之下，将五国与西德的煤钢工业实行合并，统一分配原料、市场与劳工。美国用“欧洲统一军”的幌子要西欧各国给它提供侵略战争的炮灰，再以“舒曼计划”的西欧煤钢工业联营把西欧变成美国兵工厂的欧洲分厂。
    “舒曼计划”的实施，就意味着西欧各国的煤将不用于住宅保暖而用于生产军备，钢不用于生产纺织和农业的机器而用于制造供给美国侵略用的枪炮和坦克。正如德国共产党主席雷曼所说的，“舒曼计划”是“死亡贩卖商的联盟”。
    “舒曼计划”虽在美国的操纵下签了字，但这个条约的实行却还是夜长梦多。条约规定法、意、荷、比、卢和西德的煤钢工业将在“渐进”的基础上合并经营，而且在正式实施以前，将有一个为期五年的“过渡时期”。这足以说明：这个罪恶计划的能否顺利实现，连美国自己也并无把握。西欧各国人民反对重新武装西德运动的广泛发展，就是对“舒曼计划”的严重障碍与打击。
