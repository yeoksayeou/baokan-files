　　Nanjing “April 1st” Massacre Main Culprit
　　Criminal Luo Chunbo Executed in Kunming
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 10th】Luo Chunbo, the main culprit of the Nanjing "April 1st" Massacre, has been executed in Kunming.
　　The criminal Luo joined the Kuomintang secret service organization "Revival Society" in 1936 and has been carrying out counter-revolutionary activities for more than ten years. In 1949, when the criminal served as the Director of the Political Warfare Department of the bandit Nanjing Garrison Headquarters, he suppressed the just demands of the Nanjing people for genuine peace, arrested 26 people, including Meng Shiheng, a democrat and member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and handed them over to the bandit leader Mao Sen for murder. On April 1st of the same year, the Kuomintang bandits carried out a fake peace conspiracy, sending a "peace delegation" north. Students from ten colleges and universities in Nanjing held a march on that day, demanding that the reactionaries sincerely seek peace. Criminal Luo then ordered military police and secret agents to surround and beat the students, killing and injuring more than 200 students, causing a major bloody incident. Before the liberation of Nanjing, criminal Luo fled to Yunnan and served as the Director of the Political Warfare Department of the bandit "Yunnan Pacification Headquarters." After the liberation of Yunnan, criminal Luo remained unrepentant and secretly carried out counter-revolutionary activities, and was finally arrested by the Kunming Military Control Commission, sentenced to death according to law, and has been executed in Kunming.

　　南京“四一”血案主要凶手
　　罗犯春波在昆明伏法
    【新华社昆明十日电】南京“四一”血案的主要凶犯罗春波已在昆明伏法。
    罗犯于一九三六年加入国民党特务组织“复兴社”，十几年来，一贯进行反革命活动。一九四九年，该犯任匪南京卫戍司令部政工处长时，曾镇压南京人民争取真正和平的正义要求，逮捕民主人士、农工民主党党员孟士衡等二十六人，交匪首毛森杀害。同年四月一日，国民党匪帮进行假和平阴谋，派遣“和平代表团”北上，南京十个专科以上学校的学生于是日举行游行，要求反动派诚意谋和，罗犯即布置宪兵、特务包围和殴打学生，共打死打伤学生二百余人，造成重大血案。南京解放前，罗犯逃往云南，任匪“云南绥靖公署政工处长”。云南解放后，罗犯仍不悔悟，秘密进行反革命活动，终被昆明市军事管制委员会逮捕，依法判处死刑，并已在昆明正法。
