　　Hatred and Friendship
　　Wu Xuanyang
　　Wohuli Mountain is located in the southeast of Fujin County, Songjiang Province, and is a very beautiful mountain. The mountain has layers of green pines, patches of lilac, and rows of willows and poplars. A small river winds around the foot of the mountain, and the clear river water irrigates the fertile fields. Hardworking people live at the foot of the mountain. Wohuli Mountain borders the great Soviet Union, and people can climb to the top of the mountain and see the Soviet people working in the fields with their telescopes, where tractors are moving slightly.

　　After March 1939, this place became a living "hell." Thousands of Japanese bandits went up the mountain, dug trenches, and built bunkers, wanting to "realize" their plan to "attack the Soviet Union and occupy China for a long time." They put up an electric fence more than one person tall around the mountain, totaling one hundred and twenty li in length. Chinese people were not allowed to walk within two hundred meters of the electric fence. If Chinese people were found forty meters away from the electric fence, the bandits would shoot them.

　　The people doing hard labor on this mountain were "laborers" captured by the Japanese bandits from Jinzhou, Liaoyang, Shandong, Hebei, and other places. Because they were secretly transported, the "laborers" did not know "what part of China this was." Slogans such as "Diligent Labor Serves the Country," "Wartime Emergency Tasks," and "Japan and Manchuria, One Heart, One Mind" were written everywhere on the mountain. The Japanese devils forced the "laborers" to work sixteen hours a day with bayonets and iron bars. In summer, people fainted in the sun, and in winter they labored in the severe cold of minus forty degrees. They lived in board sheds, freezing and unable to sleep in winter, and the rooms were full of water on rainy days. They ate acorn flour porridge and were dizzy with hunger. If anyone mentioned going home, they would be dragged to the riverbank and shot at night. The Japanese policy was to "maintain military secrets and not let a single Chinese coolie escape from the mountain." The number of Chinese people who died on this mountain is impossible to count. According to estimates by nearby residents, there were at least seven or eight thousand people.

　　Ma Yunrong was one of the "laborers" who escaped from here. He narrated the whole process: I am a farmer, and my home is in Baolin Village, Fujin County. One evening in June 1945, more than a dozen Japanese soldiers came down from the mountain, carrying "38" rifles, and went to various homes to grab "official carts." I was taken to Wohuli Mountain. We were forced to haul things from the city to the mountain every night. We had to take off our clothes while sleeping for a while during the day, because they were afraid we would run away. The "laborers" working on the mountain were simply tortured beyond recognition. We looked forward to day and night, hoping for the day when we could escape from the mountain! In August, Soviet Red Army planes came and destroyed the bunkers and trenches on the mountain. We jumped for joy, thinking that we had finally made it. Unexpectedly, on August 11th, just as the sun was setting, the Japanese devils drove more than two hundred of us "cart drivers" into a large house. Then a team of Japanese soldiers came in, carrying guns with bayonets attached, and set up two machine guns at the door, not allowing us to move. The devils tied our hands with iron wire, in groups of ten or twenty, and dragged us out. Before long, we heard people shouting in the distance: "Little Japanese devils! You have lost all conscience!..." When our group of twenty-two people were driven out, I saw countless heads hanging on the branches, and the ground was covered in dripping blood. My heart beat violently, as if it was about to explode. When we reached the hillside, the devils made us kneel down, and then three Japanese soldiers came over, carrying sabers, ready to chop off our heads. I saw with my own eyes that Tian Yong from Fude Village, who was kneeling next to me, had his head chopped off by a devil with one stroke. The head rolled to one side. Then, I felt the knife raised over my head... When it was dark, I opened my eyes and saw corpses all around me. My neck was covered in blood, and my chest hurt terribly. I endured the pain, knocked open the iron wire tied to my hands on a rock, held my chin with my hand, and secretly crawled down the mountain. When I got home, I stayed in the hospital and was not cured after two months.

　　At this time, the Soviet Red Army defeated Japan and entered Fujin City. I went to the Soviet Red Army hospital for treatment, and they comforted me and told me to rest assured. After fifty-three days of treatment, without spending a penny, my neck was cured. Now I have been liberated, divided the land, have horses and carts, and built a new house. Life is good, and I have become the village chief and joined the Communist Party of China!

　　Every time I touch the three-finger-deep knife wound on the back of my neck and see the stab wound on my chest, I wish I could catch the Japanese devils and take a bite. Now, the American devils want to prop up Japan again to kill us Chinese people. I will risk this head that hasn't fallen off and resolutely oppose it! (Attached pictures)

　　仇恨和友情
    吴宣扬
    卧虎里山在松江省富锦县东南，是一座很美丽的山。山上有层层青松、片片丁香，柳树、杨树排列成行。山下有一条小河蜿蜒绕过，清清的河水灌溉着肥沃的田野。山脚下居住着勤劳的人民。卧虎里山与伟大苏联友邦接壤，人们登上山峰，用望远镜可以看到在田野里劳动着的苏联人民，拖拉机在微微蠕动。
    一九三九年三月以后，这里变成了人间“地狱”。数千日本强盗上了山，挖战壕，修地堡，想“实现”“进攻苏联、长期侵占中国”的计划。他们在山下四周拉上一人多高的电网，共长一百二十里。在电网二百米内不准中国人走，如果离电网四十米的地方发现中国人，强盗们就开枪射击。
    在这座山上做苦工的，是日本强盗从锦州、辽阳、山东、河北等地抓来的“劳工”。因为是秘密运来的，所以“劳工”们都不知道“这是中国的什么地方”。山上到处写着“勤劳报国”、“战时非常任务”、“日满一德一心”等标语。鬼子们用刺刀和铁棒逼着“劳工”一天干十六个钟头的苦工。夏天，人们在太阳下晒晕过去，冬天在零下四十度的严寒里劳动。住的是板棚子，冬天冻得睡不着，雨天则满屋是水。吃的是橡子面粥，饿得发晕。病了，只有等死。谁要提到回家的事，夜晚就被拉到河边枪毙。日寇的政策是“保守军事秘密，不让一个中国苦力逃下山去”。死在这座山上的中国人民是无法统计的。据附近居民的估计，至少也有七、八千人。
    马运荣是从这里逃出来的“劳工”之一。他叙述前后经过说：我是一个庄稼人，家住在富锦县保林村。一九四五年六月的一天晚上，从山上下来十多个日本兵，端着“三八”枪，到各家抓“官车”。我被抓到卧虎里山上。我们每夜被逼着从城里往山上拉东西。白天睡一会儿觉，还得把衣服扒光，因为怕我们逃跑。山上干活的“劳工”，简直被折磨得不像人样子。我们盼白天，盼黑夜，盼着什么时候才能逃下山去！八月，苏联红军的飞机来了，把山上的地堡和战壕，都炸毁了。我们乐得直蹦，心想这可熬到头了。那想到，八月十一号这天，太阳刚偏西的时候，日本鬼子把我们二百多个“赶车”的都赶到一个大房子里，接着进来一队鬼子兵，端着枪，枪上插着刺刀，门口架着两挺机关枪，不准我们动。鬼子用铁丝把我们的手绑起，十个一伙二十个一伙地拉了出去。不一会就听见远处人们喊着：“小日本鬼呀！你们丧尽了天良！……”我们这一伙二十二个人被赶出去的时候，我看到树枝上挂着数不清的人头，鲜血滴了满地。我心跳得厉害，心像炸开了一样。到了半山坡，鬼子让我们跪下，接着过来三个日本兵，手里提着战刀，要来砍我们的头。我亲眼看见跪在我旁边的福德村的田永，被鬼子一刀砍下头来。头滚向一边。接着，我觉着大刀在我头上举了一下……。天黑的时候，我睁开了眼，一看身旁尽是死尸。我脖子里流满了血，前胸脯疼得厉害。我忍着痛，把捆在手上的铁丝在石头上磕开，手托着下巴，偷偷地爬下了山。到了家，住了医院，治了两个月还没有治好。
    这时，苏联红军打败了日本，进了富锦城。我到苏联红军医院去治，他们安慰我，让我放心。治了五十三天，一个钱没花，脖子便治好了。如今我翻了身，分了地，有马有车，盖了新房。日子过好了，又当了村长，还参加了中国共产党！
    我每回摸到脖子后面三指深的刀伤，瞧见胸前被扎的伤疤时，就恨不得捉住日寇咬几口。现在，美国鬼子又想把日本扶起来，再来杀咱们中国人，我要拚出这个没掉的脑袋，坚决反对它！（附图片）
