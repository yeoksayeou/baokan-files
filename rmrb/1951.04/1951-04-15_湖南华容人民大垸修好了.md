　　To the Editor:
    The People's Grand Embankment (a low-lying area surrounded by dikes) in the north of the Hedong area of Huarong County, Hunan Province, was quickly repaired last winter with government loans and assistance and leadership. However, during the Kuomintang rule, due to the corruption and obstruction of landlords and township chiefs, farmers spent a lot of effort but could never repair this embankment.
    The People's Grand Embankment is formed by the merger of eight smaller embankments. Eighty percent of the land within the embankment is fertile silt land. Last year's cotton grew more than two meters tall, almost like small trees; this year's spring seedlings are also growing very well. Preparations are now underway to expand cotton planting, and this embankment will become the first-class cotton planting area in Huarong County.
    The project was carried out by the dike-repairing team organized by farmers from three townships in the first and fourth districts. Because repairing the dike was the farmers' own business, everyone was very enthusiastic. Li Qingjiang, the third squad leader, is a newly liberated poor peasant. Every day before dawn, he carries a load of firewood to the street to exchange for rice to cook. After eating, he immediately goes to work on the dike. He also concurrently serves in the farmers' association, leading the masses to dig ditches and plant cotton, and also helps with farming. He is so busy that he doesn't even have time to put on his straw sandals. His enthusiasm for serving the people has greatly encouraged the dike-repairing laborers.

### 湖南华容人民大垸修好了

　　湖南华容人民大垸修好了编辑同志：
    湖南华容县河东北面的人民大垸（以堤围起来的低洼地区），去冬经政府贷粮扶助和领导，很快就修好了。但在国民党统治时期，因为地主、乡保长的贪污阻挠，农民花过很多的力气，总是修不好这个垸。
    人民大垸是由八个垸子合并起来的，垸内有百分之八十的土地，是肥沃的泥沙地。去年长的棉花有两公尺多高，简直象小树一样；今年的春苗也长得很好。现在正准备扩大植棉，这个垸将成为华容县第一等的植棉区。
    工程是由一、四区三个乡的农民所组织的修堤大队进行的。因为修堤是农民自己的事，所以大家都很起劲。第三中队长李晴江是一个新翻身的贫苦农民，他每天天不亮就掮起一担柴上街换米煮饭吃，吃过饭，马上到堤上做工。他还兼任农会工作，要领导群众开沟港和植棉，又要代耕，他忙得草鞋穿不上脚。他这种为人民服务的热忱，给修堤民工以很大的鼓励。
