Why are Large Batches of Cloth Under Size?
    The North China Textile Administration Bureau Should Investigate Responsibility and Seriously Implement Contract Regulations
    Editor's Note: On March 27th, we received a letter from Xin Guang, a worker at the Tianjin No. 2 State-owned Cotton Factory, exposing the factory's lack of attention to product specifications, resulting in short-length cloth. After sending a letter to the Tianjin Municipal Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation for investigation, it was confirmed to be true. We are now publishing the worker's letter and the Tianjin Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation's investigation report on this matter together. We hope that the cadres in charge of production will pay attention to this lesson, strictly pay attention to the quality and specifications of products, and conscientiously implement the contract regulations.
  (I) A Letter from a Worker at the Tianjin No. 2 State-owned Cotton Factory

    Editor:
    I am a worker at the Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory of the North China Textile Administration Bureau. I would like to talk to you about the problem of short-length cloth in our factory.

    In June and July last year, the cloth produced by our factory was mostly over forty yards long. Therefore, the factory and the engineers discussed cutting half a yard off each long piece of cloth and selling it as cloth scraps. However, because the standard specifications were not accurately grasped, the fine cloth delivered to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation was generally short in length, with each piece of cloth only thirty-nine and six or seven tenths of a yard. It is said that the person who suggested cutting the cloth scraps even received a bonus.

    Now the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation is negotiating with the North China Textile Administration Bureau because of the short length. Not only has the person responsible not been held accountable, but they are also fighting a lawsuit with the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation. Isn't this the old way of doing things? Therefore, please clarify the right and wrong of this matter and correct the wrong ideas of some people.
              Xin Guang

  (II) Investigation Report of the Tianjin Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation

    Editor:

    Regarding the matter of the North China Textile Administration Bureau allocating more than one million pieces of short-length cloth to our company last year, after three inspections by us and a review by the Central Textile Industry Department, it has been proven to be true. However, the North China Textile Administration Bureau has repeatedly concealed its mistakes and shirked its responsibility by using the excuse that "the folded code measurement" was insufficient. Of course, since October of last year, the Five Blessings Cloth produced by the factories under the bureau has met the standard specifications, but the short-length incident in the past has not yet been reasonably resolved. The investigation of this matter is written to you as follows.

    From June to September last year, our company had the North China Textile Administration Bureau weave 548,000 pieces of dyed grey cloth, and also extracted 895,000 pieces of Five Blessings Cloth. During the first extraction of more than 300,000 pieces of grey cloth for delivery to various dyeing factories for processing, it was found that they were generally under the specified length. In October of this year, according to the Tianjin Daily's report on the insufficient length of the Five Blessings Cloth produced by the No. 2 State-owned Cotton Factory, we also inspected our inventory of Five Blessings Cloth and found that it was generally short. We requested the North China Textile Administration Bureau to send personnel to inspect and demanded that the producing party be responsible for compensating the losses.

    After the first inspection, the North China Textile Administration Bureau admitted that the cloth was indeed short. The bureau explained that the reason for the short length was that cotton cloth undergoes folding and packaging, and the width may increase due to the pressure of the machine, and the length will inevitably shrink. Changes in the temperature and humidity of the cotton can also affect the shrinkage of the length. We believe that the short length of the grey cloth is very large, and there is no widening fact, so the above two reasons should not be emphasized. Cotton and yarn have certain moisture content standards. If the quality of the cloth is affected or does not meet the specifications due to this, the producing party should be responsible for compensation. Therefore, we immediately reported the inspection situation to the Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economic Committee and the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation for joint resolution.

    In early October, the North China Textile Administration Bureau sent personnel for a second inspection and proposed to carry out the inspection by measuring the total length of the entire piece with a tape measure. We could not agree. Because cotton cloth is stipulated to be forty yards long, with forty widths per yard, the yarn factory operates with machines, folding forty widths to make one piece, instead of measuring forty yards and then folding it into forty widths; at the same time, the market trades in pieces, which also measures the length of the width and then checks the number of widths, instead of measuring the total length of the entire piece. Later, the Central Textile Industry Department also instructed that the inspection should be carried out according to common practice, but the North China Textile Administration Bureau did not comply.

    After that, we continued to thoroughly inspect and found that the Five Blessings Cloth had a weight deficiency (each piece had a weight deficiency of more than 0.25 pounds). At the end of October, we reported this situation to the Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economic Committee, the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, and sent a copy to the North China Textile Administration Bureau, but the bureau still shirked its responsibility. The bureau sent a letter on November 6 stating: "According to the bureau's operating standard regulations, a weight of less than 11.5 pounds is considered second-class cloth; and a weight deficiency of 0.25 pounds is only the standard for deducting wages within the factory and cannot be listed as second-class cloth." However, in the National Public Textile Industry Conference convened by the Central Textile Industry Department in March 1950, it was stipulated that the allowable tolerance for the weight of each piece of yarn and cloth should not exceed 0.25 pounds, otherwise it would be second-class cloth. At the same time, before the discovery of short-length and weight-deficiency incidents, the North China Textile Administration Bureau repeatedly cited the above regulations due to issues such as cotton grade, mixed cotton composition, and cotton quantity requirements.

    On November 11, the Central Textile Industry Department sent personnel to jointly inspect the inventory cloth with the North China Textile Administration Bureau and our company. The inspection method was to measure the length of the width with a yardstick. The results showed that the average short length of each piece of Five Blessings Cloth was 9 and 10/16 inches; the average short length of each piece of grey cloth was 10 and 12/16 inches. Afterwards, the Central Textile Industry Department instructed the North China Textile Administration Bureau (a copy of this document was sent to our company): "Since the short length is a fact, it should be compensated in full. In the future, the finished product inspection work should be strictly implemented. And the short-length incident should be used to educate employees, so as to avoid similar incidents from happening again." In its reply to the Central Textile Industry Department on March 10 this year, the Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economic Committee expressed its agreement with the above investigation and proposed specific compensation methods.

    However, the North China Textile Administration Bureau also proposed that the company did not devalue and sell all the short-length and weight-deficient cloth, but instead transferred the loss to consumers, so it should not be required to compensate for the loss. We believe that strict enforcement of specifications is an attitude of responsibility to producers and consumers, and responsibility should not be considered based on the profit or loss of either party. Secondly, most of the Five Blessings Cloth, except for a small portion directly supplied to the market, is allocated for military use and for processing by public and private factories (and all the dyed grey cloth is processed for our own use), so the compensation can be returned to the consumers.

    In order to ensure the specifications and quality of products in the future, we hope that the North China Textile Administration Bureau will lead the public and private factories to further establish standards for the operation of yarn and cloth; and we hope that Tianjin can organize a joint product inspection committee with the participation of all relevant parties including finance, economics, production, and trade, to facilitate the inspection of product specifications.

　　为什么大批布匹尺码不足？
    华北纺织管理局应追查责任认真执行合同规定
    编者按：我们于三月二十七日接到天津国棉二厂工人新光的来信，揭发该厂不重视产品规格，因而发生布匹短码的事件。经去函中国花纱布公司天津市公司调查，证明属实。现将工人来信及天津花纱布公司对此事的调查报告一并发表。希望管理生产的干部重视这一教训，严格地注意产品的质量、规格，并认真执行合同的规定。
  （一）天津国棉二厂工人的来信编辑同志：
    我是华北纺织管理局天津国棉纺织第二厂的一个工人。我愿意把本厂布匹短码的问题和你们谈谈。
    去年六七月间，我厂所产布匹，多超过四十码。因此，厂方与工程师商量，把长码的布每匹剪下半码，当作布头出售。但因没有精确地掌握标准规格，以致交给花纱布公司的细布普遍短码，每匹布只有三十九码六、七。听说建议剪裁布头的人还得了奖金。
    现在花纱布公司因为短码事，已与华北纺织管理局进行交涉。当事人不仅未曾追究责任，还与花纱布公司打官司，这岂不是旧作风吗？所以请你们弄清楚这件事的是非，纠正某些人的错误想法。
              新光
  （二）天津花纱布公司的调查报告编辑同志：
    关于华北纺织管理局去年拨交我公司百余万匹布短码事，经过我们前后三次检验，及会同中央纺织工业部复查，证明属实。但华北纺织管理局以“叠码衡量”不足为准作借口，一再掩饰错误，推卸责任。当然，自去年十月以后，该局所属各厂生产的五福布，已合规格标准，但过去的短码事件，至今仍未合理解决。现将对此事的调查情形写给你们。
    去年六至九月，本公司由华北纺织管理局代织染色坯布五十四万八千余匹，另提取五福布八十九万五千余匹。在第一次提取坯布三十余万匹交付各染厂加工时，发现普遍不足尺码。本年十月，我们根据天津日报报道国棉二厂所产五福布不足尺码情况，又检查我们库存的五福布，亦普遍发现短码情形。我们提请华北纺织管理局派员前来检查，并要求产方负责赔偿损失。
    华北纺织管理局在第一次检查后，已承认确实短码。该局解释短码原因是：棉布经过摺幅打包工程，受机器之压力，宽度可能增加，长度势必缩减。棉花温湿度的变化，亦可影响长度回缩。我们认为坯布短码很大，且无加宽事实，故不应强调上述两项理由。按棉花和纱布都有一定的含水标准，如因此影响布匹质量或不合规格时，产方应负责赔偿。因此，我们即将检查情况呈报天津市财政经济委员会和中国花纱布公司协同解决。
    华北纺织管理局于十月初二次派员检查，提出要以皮尺量全匹总长的办法实行检验。我们未能同意。因为棉布规定长四十码，每码一幅共四十幅，纱厂以机器操作，摺叠四十幅即为一匹，而不是量足四十码再摺成四十幅；同时市场成匹交易，亦系量幅长而后查幅数，不是量全匹总长。后中央纺织工业部亦指示应按常例检查，但华北纺织管理局亦不遵照执行。
    此后，我们继续彻底检查，又发现五福布有亏磅（每匹亏磅均超过零点二五磅）情况。我们于十月底把这种情况呈报天津市财政经济委员会、中国花纱布公司并抄致华北纺织管理局，但该局对此仍推卸责任。该局于十一月六日来函称：“亏磅问题，照我局经营标准规定，凡不足十一磅半者，始为次布；而亏零点二五磅者，仅系厂内评分扣工资的标准，不能列为次布。”但在一九五○年三月中央纺织工业部所召开的全国公营纺织工业会议中，对纱布经营标准曾规定：每匹布重量允许公差，不得超过零点二五磅，否则即为次布。同时，在未发现短码亏磅事件前，华北纺织管理局因棉花等级、混棉成份与需棉数量等问题，曾屡次引用上述规定。
    十一月十一日，中央纺织工业部派员会同华北纺织管理局及我公司检验该项库存布匹。检验方法是用码尺量幅长，结果平均五福布每匹短码九又十六分之十英寸；坯布每匹平均短码十又十六分之十二英寸。此后，中央纺织工业部即指示华北纺织管理局（此件曾抄致我公司）：“短码既属事实，即应如数赔偿。今后成品检验工作，应严格执行。并以此次短码事件，教育职工，以免再有类似事件发生。”天津市财政经济委员会在今年三月十日复中央纺织工业部对此事的处理意见中，表示同意上述调查，并曾提出具体的赔偿办法。
    但华北纺织管理局又提出：所有短码亏磅之布匹，公司并未贬值出售，而是将此项损失转嫁于消费者，所以不应要求赔偿损失。我们认为，严格执行规格，是对生产者和消费者的负责态度，不应以何方损益计较责任。其次，这批五福布除直接供销市场一小部分外，大部分是拨供军用及公私营工厂加工用（染色坯布则全部加工自用），所以这笔赔偿是可以退还给消费者的。
    为了在今后保证产品的规格与质量，我们希望华北纺织管理局领导各公、私营工厂，更进一步地订立纱布经营规格标准；并希望天津市能组织一包括财经、生产、贸易等有关各方面参加的联合检验产品委员会，以便利产品规格的检验。
