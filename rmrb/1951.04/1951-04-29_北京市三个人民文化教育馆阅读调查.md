Reading Survey of Three People's Cultural Education Centers in Beijing

    Recently, we conducted a survey on reading habits in the Second, Fourth, and Fifth People's Cultural Education Centers in Beijing. The readership of these three cultural education centers is roughly as follows: The Second Cultural Education Center (Qianmen in the commercial district) primarily serves shop assistants and children; the Fourth Cultural Education Center (Dongliulichang in a small industrial and commercial area) primarily serves shop assistants, while its mobile reading station serves mainly handicraft workers; the Fifth Cultural Education Center (Dongsi Pailou Qitiao in a residential area) has a majority of children as readers, and its mobile reading station also mainly serves workers from small factories.

    The reading situation in all three cultural education centers consistently reflects the readers' fondness for picture story books (lianhuanhua). Readers of picture story books account for more than 80% of the total readership. These readers almost unanimously feel that the content of the picture story books is monotonous, believing that "the same old stories of peasants turning over" cannot meet their needs. Secondly, in terms of the illustration techniques of the picture story books, they also point out shortcomings such as simple storylines, insufficient coherence, and low artistic quality. According to the comrades working in the cultural education centers, some readers say that certain picture story books "don't draw people like people," "the stories have no plot," and "they are not satisfying to read." They often repeatedly ask the staff, "Are there any good ones?" Among the picture story books, those most popular are the "New Children's Heroes," "Chicken Feather Letter," "Worker Zhang Feihu," and "Brother Hou and His Young Pioneers" published by the Popular Art Publishing House. Not only do children love to read these books, but adults also compete to read them. Some movie story picture story books are also very popular with readers, but unfortunately, there are too few of them. Picture story books with the theme of resisting America and aiding Korea are also too few, among which "Korean People's Guerrilla Team" and "A Korean Soldier" are more popular. "The History of American Imperialism's Aggression Against China" is not yet accepted by the general public, mainly because it uses one picture to represent a historical event, and readers cannot understand it because they are not yet familiar with history.

    In literary works, "New Children's Heroes" is universally welcomed. According to the Second and Fourth Cultural Education Centers, "People's Literature Series" is also borrowed by many readers, but they did not specify which titles. The Fifth Cultural Education Center clearly pointed out that, in addition to "New Children's Heroes," books such as "Heroes of Lüliang," "Changes in Lijiazhuang," and "A Cotton Gin" are frequently borrowed. Some books, such as "Liu Qiao's Reunion" and "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," used to be popular with readers, but now they are borrowed less frequently. According to their understanding, the reason is that "they are tired of reading them." Comrades from the Second Cultural Education Center said that the combat stories of the People's Liberation Army and the stories of combat heroes are very attractive. Especially the heroic achievements of our volunteer troops in the war to resist America and aid Korea have become the focus of readers' love, but there are still too few literary novels written with this type of story. All three cultural education centers reflect that there are relatively few readers of folk art and scripts.

    Many readers borrow books on social sciences, but they all find them too profound and feel unable to digest them. Readers at the Second Cultural Education Center requested that more social science books be published that are simpler than "Popular Philosophy." Popular science books are also equally welcomed, especially popular medical and health publications. Readers at the Second Cultural Education Center borrow a lot of popular crafts books. Readers also requested more scientific picture story books.

    Current affairs publications are also welcomed by readers, but there are too few that are truly popular. Readers at the Second Cultural Education Center hope that some popular books explaining laws and policies will be published, especially books explaining industrial and commercial policies.

    From this partial reading survey, it is not difficult to see that the choice of publications by this group of readers is adapted to their cultural level and living conditions. Picture story books and literary novels with the story of peasants turning over cannot fully meet the reading interests of urban people. They need more publications that are relevant to their real lives, which is understandable. This shows that seizing certain reader groups and conducting publicity and education suitable for their needs is a path that popular publications should take. Secondly, these readers' opinions also clearly reflect other requirements for popularization—to use language as popularly as possible, to explain principles as popularly as possible, not to have too broad topics, and to ensure that the content is concrete.

### 北京市三个人民文化教育馆阅读调查

　　北京市三个人民文化教育馆阅读调查
    最近我们曾经向北京市第二、第四和第五等三个人民文化教育馆进行了一次阅读情况的调查。这三个文教馆的读者成份大体是这样：第二文教馆（商业区的前门）读者主要是店员和儿童；第四文教馆（小型工商业区域的东琉璃厂）的读者主要是店员，它的巡回阅览站的读者主要是手工业工人；第五文教馆（住宅区的东四牌楼七条）的读者，以儿童占多数，它的巡回阅览站的读者大致也是一些小型工厂的工人。
    三个文教馆的阅读情况一致反映了读者对连环图画的爱好。连环图画的阅读者约占全部阅览人数的百分之八十以上。这些读者也差不多一致地感到连环图画的内容单调，认为“老一套的农民翻身的故事”不能满足他们的需要；其次，在连环图画的编绘技术上，也指出故事性简单、连贯性不够、艺术性不高等缺点。据文教馆工作同志反映：有些读者说某些连环图画《画得人不像人》，《故事没有情节》，《看了不够味儿》；他们往往不断追问工作人员：“还有好的没有？”在连环图画中最受欢迎的是大众图画出版社的《新儿女英雄传》、《鸡毛信》、《工人张飞虎》、《侯哥弹和他的少年队》等，这些书不但儿童们爱看，成年的人也争着看。一些电影故事连环图画也很受读者欢迎，可惜出的还太少。以抗美援朝为主题的连环图画也是太少，其中较受欢迎的是《朝鲜人民游击队》、《朝鲜一兵》等。《美帝侵华史》还不能为一般读者所接受，主要原因是它用一幅图表现一个历史事件，而读者因为还不熟悉历史，因此不能领悟。
    在文艺读物中，《新儿女英雄传》受到普遍的欢迎；《人民文艺丛书》据第二、第四文教馆说，也有很多读者借阅，但没有具体指明哪些书名。第五文教馆比较明确地指出，除了“新儿女英雄传”外，借得多的有《吕梁英雄传》、《李家庄的变迁》、《一架弹花机》。有些书如《刘巧团圆》、《王贵与李香香》等曾经受到读者爱好，但现在借的较少，据他们了解，原因也是“看腻了”。第二文教馆工作同志们说：解放军的战斗故事和战斗英雄的故事很有吸引力，特别是在抗美援朝战争中我志愿部队的英勇战绩成为读者爱好的中心，但以这一类故事写成的文艺小说还是太少。三个文教馆一致反映：曲艺和剧本的阅读者都比较少。
    对于社会科学书籍，读者借阅的很多，但都嫌太深，感到消化不了。第二文教馆的读者要求能多出版一些比《大众哲学》更浅的社会科学书籍。通俗性的自然科学书籍也同样受到欢迎，特别是通俗的医药卫生读物。第二文教馆的读者借阅通俗工艺书籍的很多。读者还要求多出一些科学性连环图画。
    时事读物也是受到读者欢迎的，但真正通俗性的太少。第二文教馆读者希望有些解释法令，政策的通俗书籍出版，尤其是阐明工商业政策的书。
    从这一局部的阅读调查中，不难看出这一部分读者对于出版物的选择是与他们的文化水平和生活情况相适应的。以翻身农民的故事为内容的连环图画与文艺小说不能完全满足城市人民的阅读兴趣，他们需要更多的与他们的现实生活相关连的出版物，这原因是可以理解的。这说明了抓紧一定的读者对象进行适合于他们要求的宣传教育，是通俗性出版物应该走上的一条道路。其次，从这些读者意见中也明确地反映了通俗化的另一些要求——要尽可能把语言用得通俗一点，把道理讲得通俗一点，题目不要太大，内容一定要具体。
