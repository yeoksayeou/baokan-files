　　Learning from the Peasants
    Yang Renpian, Professor of Peking University

    "One visit to the land reform is worth two years of study;" – Many people who have visited the land reform have this feeling. The reason is simple: reading is not as good as hearing, and hearing is not as good as seeing. The facts are presented before our eyes, convincing us without the need for explanation, leaving us no room for sophistry. Intellectuals may have their own set of views on practical politics that they confidently believe are correct. However, after visiting the land reform, it immediately becomes clear that this set of views is ultimately wrong. Only then do they realize how an intellectual's self-confidence is a stubborn force that hinders their progress. Stepping out of the study, out of the city, and into the countryside where class struggle is most acute, coming into contact with the peasants and the vast reality, the broadened horizons allow me to no longer be dominated by self-confidence. Thus, I gradually began to learn from the peasants. What did I learn?

  First, I Understood Revolution from Land Reform

    I once thought: the purpose of revolution lies in seizing political power. Once the people's regime is consolidated, the anti-feudal land reform can be smoothly promoted. This is tantamount to saying that land reform is the fruit of revolution, and a so-called "peaceful land reform" that does not require fierce struggle is feasible. After coming into contact with reality, I gradually realized that I did not thoroughly understand the revolution, and therefore did not thoroughly understand the land reform policy.

    The foundation of the people's regime is indeed consolidated, but the land reform policy cannot be completed solely through government decrees and cadre execution. In areas that have been liberated for less than two years, the political power in some rural areas is still inevitably controlled by counter-revolutionaries who serve the landlords. It cannot be expected that they will thoroughly implement the land reform policy. After we arrived at Shishan Township, Hengshan County, Hunan Province, the responsible comrades explained in their report that the cadres who first arrived in the township to understand the situation were surrounded by this group of people. As a result, when the work team went to the township to carry out work, they encountered some inappropriate difficulties, which made the work of mobilizing the masses not as good as Songao Township, which we had already seen. The purpose of land reform is to eliminate the landlord class. The landlord class, with its long history and tradition, is by no means willing to be eliminated. They have used counter-revolutionary activities, even organizing armed riots, to undermine the people's regime; they have used clan relations to divide the peasants; they have organized gangs to oppress the peasants; they have used the painful experience of the failure of the Great Revolution of 1927 to create "the change of heaven" ideology to scare the peasants; enticement and rumors are even more common weapons of struggle they use. The thoroughness of dispersing property and the severity of destroying property are almost unimaginable to us. We visited the residences of three local bullies and landlords. The dilapidated and chaotic situation made it hard for us to believe that these were the homes of landlords not long ago. We witnessed the struggle against three landlords. Their consistent attitude was denial, deception, and stubbornness. One of them had been struggled against nine times, but had never yielded any results. The reason why landlords commit crimes and stubbornly deal with struggle is simply because this is a class struggle. They are determined to resist, preferring to die rather than hand over the fruits to the peasants. It is said that one landlord, after hearing that another landlord had hanged himself out of fear of punishment, said with a sneer, "Suicide is not worth it;" this fully demonstrates the stubbornness of the landlords in the class struggle. If the landlords are like this, then what about the peasants who have been oppressed and exploited by them for generations and cannot get enough to eat and keep warm? Once they are mobilized, awakened, and confident in their ability to struggle, what will they do? Their fighting spirit is not difficult to imagine. After the on-the-spot visit, I deeply experienced that land reform is indeed a sharp and fierce class struggle; therefore, I understood that the so-called "peaceful land reform" is simply impossible if land reform is to be thoroughly implemented. Since land reform is a sharp and fierce class struggle, then land reform is revolution, not the result of revolution; conversely, if the anti-feudal land reform is not completed, then the new democratic revolution is not completed either.

    The task of the revolution is not only to complete the land reform but also to further consolidate the fruits of the land reform. The counter-revolutionary landlord class has indeed been defeated, but they may not be willing to accept labor reform wholeheartedly, and some may still dream of a comeback. Otherwise, there should be no counter-revolutionary espionage activities in the cities where the people's regime has been generally consolidated. The landlords are waiting for an opportunity to act, and the peasants are also vigilant at all times. We understood the relationship between anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism from political study, but not as specifically and directly as the peasants. They said: The landlords hope that Chiang Kai-shek will return, Chiang Kai-shek relies on American imperialism; American imperialism wants to use Chiang Kai-shek, and Chiang Kai-shek wants to use the landlords. They can now only send secret agents to carry out counter-revolutionary activities in the country. To ensure their liberation, the peasants must not only defeat the landlords but also liberate Taiwan, overthrow American imperialism, and suppress counter-revolutionaries. This logic is so simple and clear. According to this logic, the struggle in the countryside is to overthrow feudalism and, at the same time, to overthrow imperialism. This is tantamount to saying: one battlefield, two enemies. The same is true on the Korean battlefield: defeating these two enemies. This is tantamount to saying: although the battlefields are different, the enemies are the same.

    Land reform is directly and indirectly related to the interests of every Chinese person. It is a very superficial illusion to think that one has no direct interest in land reform because one is neither a landlord nor a peasant. The reason for this illusion is that we live in the city and do not understand the reality of the countryside. The peasants will not come to the city to promote it. The crimes of the landlord class cannot be thoroughly understood without on-the-spot observation, and therefore, one cannot understand how their crimes are a force that hinders the development of the New China. On the contrary, the landlords can not only escape to the city to promote it, but they also have several volunteer promoters. Their class stand will naturally lead them to exaggerate the excessive leftist deviations in the land reform; these malicious exaggerations are often easily transmitted to intellectuals because many of the people we come into contact with are from the landlord class or related to the landlord class. As a result, our class stand is easily blurred. Since land reform is a struggle for the peasants to settle accounts with the landlords, deviations are inevitable, even if they are not to be encouraged, they are at least excusable. When I first participated in the land reform, I regretted choosing to visit the Central South region because I knew that our "Hunan barbarians" were daring to struggle, not to mention the blood debt of 1927; I was worried that encountering excessive leftist deviations would further blur my class stand. Having been psychologically prepared, I was pleasantly surprised after seeing the heated struggle scene. At this time, I admired the ability of the cadres to grasp the instructions on correcting deviations, but at the same time, I felt that the struggle was too gentle. (According to reports from several friends – including some landlords – there are now generally no deviations; if there were deviations in the past, justice often stood on the side of the peasants.) The feeling of "too gentle" is certainly wrong, but it shows that we have begun to have a clear class stand: the peasants' grievances win our sympathy, and the landlords' stubbornness earns our hatred; – this is only emotional. However, the peasants' grievances make us more aware of the cruelty of feudal exploitation and the backwardness of feudal production, and the landlords' sabotage and stubbornness make us more aware that class struggle is inevitably sharp; thus, it leads us to a rational consideration: if we recognize that land reform is a necessary condition for building a new China, then the landlord class must be defeated; if the fate of the new China and our fate are closely related, then we must stand on the side of the peasants and cannot stand by. When we saw the landlords stubbornly resisting to the end in the struggle, not only did each of us emotionally support the peasants, but we also recognized that we had a responsibility to help them in some way. We discussed some "scholar" methods, which of course did not help the actual situation, but this has already shown that we are not just here to visit, but actually have the significance of participating in the struggle. Since then, when we encountered other problems, we naturally and unanimously stood on the side of the peasants, hoping to do our best to help solve them; after our group returned to Beijing, we still did not give up such efforts. As a result of such gradual development in thought, I abandoned the illusion that "land reform has nothing to do with me directly," and answered the question of why to lean to one side – a question that had been intellectually unresolved for two years.

    Visiting the land reform allowed me to understand the revolution in this way. This understanding did not come from conclusions, nor from reading and discussion, but was taught to me by the peasants. At the same time, I have to learn from the peasants how to practice, because this theoretical understanding is still very high in my opinion, and there is still a considerable distance from practice.

  Second, I Experienced Practice from Land Reform

    After visiting the land reform, I realized that land reform is not a rigid job. Policies and steps are consistent, but in dealing with individual problems, it is not the same everywhere; even between counties and even between townships, they may be different from each other. This is the result of practice. Because problems must be solved in light of the actual situation, it cannot be mechanical, but must be dialectical. I once thought: since land reform is taking land from the hands of a small class and distributing it to the class with the largest number of people, it is such a major and detailed task. The measurement of fields, the identification of soil properties, and the investigation of household registration must be completed by formulating a plan and mobilizing experts in advance. This is such a mechanical, scholarly view!

    Political commentators who like to make witty remarks once called the Chinese peasants 400 million Adous [a derogatory term for incompetent people]; in addition to being ignorant, they must also bear the crime of selfishness. When carrying out land reform, they are no longer Adous, but rather several collective Zhuge Liangs [a symbol of wisdom]; as for not being selfish, they at least perform better than intellectuals. The reason why they are able to do this is due to the correct mass line. Regarding the mass line, here I only want to point out that only the mass line can produce collective wisdom that can be put into practice, and only the mass line can produce a selfless spirit that can be put into practice. The masses are mobilized by cadres and led by cadres. If the cadres lead the masses by the nose, the masses will become Adous; if he becomes the tail of the masses, he may deviate. The reason why the masses can practice is only because the cadres can also practice; the cadres believe in the masses and are united with the masses, not standing on the heads of the masses as we imagined. Only in this way can the masses produce the wisdom and selfless spirit necessary for practice.

    The cultural level of the peasants is not high, but let's see how they use collective wisdom to solve some difficulties. It is said that during the so-called "peaceful land reform" period, the landlords recited the articles of the Land Reform Law more fluently than the cadres, and held the Land Reform Law in their hands to scare the peasants when classifying classes. However, when struggling against local bullies and classifying classes, the peasants were not seen holding the Land Reform Law, and no peasant was heard quoting the articles of the Land Reform Law. After learning how to classify classes, they only summarized several principles that every peasant could use to deal with the landlords; these few simple principles could make the landlords speechless. The same method was used to classify other classes. Such a complicated task as classifying classes was completed in just over ten days. Intellectuals inevitably criticize them for being "unscientific," but they classified them so accurately. (Because it is considered that it may not be accurate, the classification of classes must still be approved by the higher authorities after the classification of classes.) The second is "land surveying," and measuring fields should be a more complicated task. The paddy fields in the hilly areas of Hunan are uneven, and there are all kinds of shapes and sizes of fields. Even measuring experts using scientific tools will feel that the work is not easy. The peasants do not even use a tape measure. They believe in the experience and judgment of honest old farmers; several such old farmers were recommended at the discussion meeting to take on this task. One group I saw had five people. When they arrived in each field, they stood in different positions, glanced with their eyes, thought in their minds, and then they knew the yield of each field (because the yield of fields is different, Hunan generally discusses yield rather than area). After they saw a larger field, I separately asked them about the estimated results. Four of them estimated 8.5 dan [a unit of dry measure], and one estimated 8 dan, which shows that their estimation was quite accurate. After estimating a number, they would add another item of number to the sign indicating the original owner and tenant's self-reported yield, so that the public could judge. Land distribution also followed the same method, with several impartial old farmers distributing it according to the principles decided at the meeting. After the distribution, on the one hand, it was registered in the books, and at the same time, the name of the owner and the tenant on the sign were scraped off with a knife, and replaced with the name of the peasant who was allocated the land. This method may not be 100% accurate – "unscientific," but it has basically solved the problem and has not caused serious disputes. What particularly caught my attention when listening to the production team meeting was the result of the discussion on water conservancy issues. In the past, people could fight or even file lawsuits for water disputes. In the future, it will certainly be more difficult to reasonably solve the water source problem under the original irrigation system. After negating several unworkable methods, they decided on the following method: the new owners of the fields within the scope of the original irrigation system would jointly recommend one person to "watch the water"; the labor he spent would be compensated by other farmers in other labor. This is such a simple and practical method!

    Although collective wisdom has solved many problems related to the vital interests of the peasants, it is not enough to explain the unselfishness of the peasants. The selfishness of the peasants is no less than that of the intellectuals; only because they have educated themselves in the process of land reform, recognized the power of unity, and thus truly reduced the selfish heart of individualism. Land surveying and land distribution are not absolutely accurate, but the peasants are happy to accept it and unanimously said, "How can it be without any difference?" Therefore, the deposit withdrawn due to the struggle was not fully returned to the tenants who originally paid the deposit; when distributing furniture, they almost followed the principle of each taking what they needed, without haggling over the monetary value of the furniture; when distributing houses, they only took care of everyone's needs. What is particularly noteworthy is the organization of the labor team, which is one of the main issues discussed at the production team meeting: in addition to deciding to take turns working for the widowed and the families of soldiers, they also agreed on the principle of "others first, me second," no wonder rural youths are so enthusiastic to join the army.

    Peasants are not as conservative and opposed to science as we imagine. On the contrary, as long as you can convince them, they are willing to accept science. At the production team meeting, most of them agreed to choose the new variety called "Victory Indica." They are not against science, but they do not violate the actual situation by clamoring for science. Their cultural level may not be very high, but they can practice, and they do what they say. Formalism is not seen in the countryside. Selfishness may be inevitable, but if the idea of individualism is overcome by one point, it will also be expressed in action by one point. People who only sing high-sounding tunes but whose actions are still backward are almost invisible in the countryside. I think intellectuals who want to study "On Practice" may as well learn from the peasants; first of all, stop clamoring and start from practice little by little.

    The peasants' spirit of practice also inspired me to solve academic problems. After reading more than 20 years of the history of the French Revolution, I did not get a correct explanation of why the land policy of the French Revolution failed until I visited the land reform. There are too many factors involved in this issue, so I can only write another article to discuss it; here, I only want to explain my conclusion. The usual explanation for this failure is: the political enemies of the Robespierre faction destroyed the implementation of this policy; the peasants were not aware and did not rise up to support this policy; the Robespierre faction failed, and the land policy also failed. Mathieu, the authority of the history of the French Revolution, and the most advanced experts have not put forward a more advanced explanation. Now I understand that the Robespierre faction was only a mechanical materialist, did not understand dialectics, and therefore did not understand the theory of practice. The policies drawn up in the study were always circulating in the parliament and yamen [government offices], and were not handed over to the masses; the masses could not give play to their spirit of practice and were willing to be Adous; thus, the policies that could have played a great role were equal to empty words. From this, it can be seen that visiting the land reform may have some inspiration for the business of every academic worker, and its role is not limited to making us recognize reality and transform our thinking.

  Third, I Foresee the Future of the New China from Land Reform

    People who have visited the land reform can foresee that the New China after the land reform will have unprecedented prosperity.

    First, Politics: In the countryside after land reform and after the establishment of political power, everyone works, and those who do not work and disrupt order will not be able to survive in the countryside. When visiting the confiscation of fruits, I saw the Young Pioneers on guard along the way; at that time, I thought that such a lively scene was an opportunity for children to play and make trouble. After being organized, they would not only not hinder the work, but would also play an active role. Thus, I further recognized the power of organization and also recognized the authenticity of the stories about the Young Pioneers in the old liberated areas. Secondly, after the completion of the national land reform, it is not difficult to obtain a fairly accurate total population and total field area by collecting the data related to land distribution; in this way, land reform incidentally completes an administrative task that has never been completed in history – a national population survey and land register survey. This will have a huge significance for the development of the New China.

    Second, Economy: After the peasants are allocated land and are no longer exploited, due to their high enthusiasm for production, strong spirit of cooperation, coupled with the help of the government and scientific guidance, the speed of production increase is beyond doubt. The increase in grain production, the increase in rural purchasing power, and the surplus of rural labor have solved half of the problem for the development of industry; and the land reform policy vigorously protects industry and commerce, leaving a foundation for the development of industry and commerce. We can easily foresee the prosperity of the economic construction of the New China, and at the same time, we can also foresee the accelerated progress of the rural appearance. In the past, I had imagined that the transition from small land ownership to collective farm system would be a very difficult move, because I had recognized that the peasants' desire for land ownership and conservatism were very strong; from the peasants' spirit of practice, I think this view is an overstatement. As long as the conditions are met, the transition to the collective farm system will be very natural.

    Third, National Defense: As politics and economy move forward, national defense will of course move forward accordingly; here, I only want to point out the issue of sources of soldiers. A good rural order has saved the country an unknown amount of military power because there is no need to station troops anymore. Under the call of patriotism to defend the country, the enthusiasm of the countryside to join the army is beyond our imagination. Almost every township has exceeded its expected number. When we visited the district people's court in Huanghua Township, Changsha, it was the time when the townships were successively sending soldiers to the district, giving us the opportunity to contact most of the young soldiers. The understanding that "overthrowing the landlords is to overthrow American imperialism" has created several moving stories of vying to join the army; under such an understanding and enthusiasm, our country will be a country that will never be bullied again.

    Fourth, Culture: Peasants are easy to accept culture. The liberated peasants can immediately accept political education and understand political theories of a fairly high standard. They can think, and think very well; they can speak, and speak well. They speak at group meetings in a reasonable and emotional way, and do not make mistakes when using new terms; therefore, we no longer have to worry too much that the peasants do not understand the conversations of intellectuals, as long as there is no accent barrier. One linguist in our visiting group said: "I have shaken the view that peasants cannot easily recognize Chinese characters"; how to improve Chinese characters is another matter, but it is an iron fact that peasants are easy to accept culture. At the same time, peasants are also eagerly demanding culture. Not being able to read, not being able to write, and not having culture are their troubles, and they want to get rid of these troubles. We saw peasant literacy classes and blackboard newspapers. According to a friend who visited the land reform in Jiangxi, he has seen peasant reading groups led by primary school teachers. Eliminating rural illiteracy is just around the corner; their demands are not only in literacy. The peasants said: "Land and houses can be divided, but culture cannot be divided!" They also said: "In the past, only landlords sent their children to school, but now we should also send our children to school." If economic conditions permit, they will send a large number of their children to schools. Therefore, our middle schools and universities must open their doors to workers and peasants, otherwise they will automatically come and knock on the door. The peasants educated me, and at the same time, I experienced that the peasants are asking us to educate them. When reporting the impressions of the land reform to the students, I emphasized this point: the peasants are expecting your help, no matter what you study. Now, I still want to emphasize this point: the peasants are expecting the efforts and help of every academic worker, no matter what you study. I think that since the peasants have educated me to understand the revolution and experience practice, if this education should play a role, then I should work hard in my post, gradually practice according to the improvement of the level of thought, so as to do my best in the work of building people's culture to repay the peasants.

    Finally, I would like to end my impressions of visiting the land reform and this article with a simplest sentence: After the land reform, the New China has a future, and everyone who is willing to work for the people also has a future. (Reprinted from Guangming Daily)

　　跟农民学习以后
    北京大学教授  杨人楩
    “参观一次土地改革，胜过两年的学习；”——若干参观过土地改革的人都有此感觉。理由很简单：阅读不如耳闻，耳闻不如目睹。事实呈现在眼前，不说而可使我们信服，不容我们诡辩。知识分子对于实际政治可能有其一套自信是正确的看法，参观土地改革以后，立即证明这一套看法毕竟错误；才了解知识分子的自信心是一个如何阻碍他进步的顽强力量。走出书斋，走出都市，走向阶级斗争最尖锐的农村，接触了农民，接触了广大的实际；广大的眼界，使我不再受自信心的支配。于是我才逐渐向农民学习。学习到些什么呢？
  第一、从土地改革认识了革命
    我曾经想：革命的目的在于夺取政权，人民政权既已巩固，就可顺利地推动反封建的土地改革。这无异是说：土地改革是革命之果；不需激烈斗争的所谓“和平土地改革”，是可以行得通的。接触实际以后，我才逐渐了解我是不曾透彻认识革命，因而也就不曾透彻了解土地改革政策。
    人民政权的基础诚然是巩固了，可是土地改革政策并非单凭政府的法令和干部的执行便可完成的。在解放不到两年的地区中，有些农村的政权仍不免为反革命分子所左右，他们是为地主服务的，不能希望他们来彻底执行土地改革政策。我们到达湖南衡山县石山乡以后，负责同志在报告中说明最先到乡了解情况的干部曾被这一批人包围，因而工作队到乡进行工作时，遭遇到一些不当遭遇的困难。以致发动群众的工作比不上我们业经看过的松坳乡。土地改革的目的在于消灭地主阶级。具有悠久历史传统的地主阶级是决不甘心被消灭的，他们曾以反革命的活动，甚至组织武装暴动，来破坏人民政权；他们利用宗族关系来分化农民；他们组织帮会来压迫农民；他们根据一九二七年大革命失败的惨痛经验制造变天思想来吓唬农民；利诱和谣言更是他们常用的斗争武器。分散财产之彻底和破坏财产之厉害，几乎是我们想像不到的。我们参观过三个恶霸地主的住宅，那种残破狼藉的情况，使我们不敢相信在不久以前这就是地主的家。我们曾看见斗争三个地主，他们一致的态度是抵赖，欺骗，与硬挺。其中一个已经斗争过九次，却始终斗不出果实。地主之所以要犯法，要以顽固态度来应付斗争，只因为这是一个阶级斗争。他们下决心抵抗，宁死不肯把果实交给农民。据说，某地主听见另一地主惧罪自缢以后，冷笑地说：“自杀才不值得；”这就充分表现出阶级斗争中地主的顽固。地主既是如此，那么，那些世代受其压迫受其剥削而不得温饱的农民，一经发动、觉悟、而自信有力量斗争以后，又将如何呢？他们的斗争精神是不难想像的。实地参观以后，我才深深地体验到土地改革确乎是尖锐而激烈的阶级斗争；因此，我才了解所谓“和平土地改革”根本是不可能的，假使要彻底实行土地改革的话。土地改革既是尖锐而激烈的阶级斗争，那么，土地改革就是革命，而不是革命的结果；反之，反封建的土地改革没有完成，新民主主义的革命也就没有完成。
    革命的任务，不但要完成土地改革，而且要进一步巩固土地改革的果实。反革命的地主阶级诚然被打垮了，未必就肯死心踏地接受劳动改造，仍不免有些梦想死灰复燃。否则，在人民政权业经普遍巩固的都市中，不当再有反革命的特务活动。地主在待机而动，农民也在随时警惕。我们从政治学习中理解到反帝反封建的关系，却不如农民了解得那么具体而干脆。他们说：地主希望蒋介石回来，蒋介石靠美帝国主义；美帝国主义要利用蒋介石，蒋介石要利用地主。他们现在只能支使特务在国内进行反革命活动。农民要保证翻身，不但要打垮地主，同时要解放台湾，要打倒美帝国主义和镇压反革命。这个逻辑是何等简单明了，根据这个逻辑来讲，农村中的斗争是要打倒封建，同时就是要打倒帝国主义，这无异是说：一个战场，两个敌人。在朝鲜战场上也同样是打倒这两个敌人，这又无异是说：战场虽不同，而敌人相同。
    土地改革是和每个中国人民的利害有间接和直接关系的。因为自己既非地主又非农人而认为自己就和土地改革没有直接利害关系，这只是一种极肤浅的错觉。错觉之所以发生，因为我们生活在都市里，不了解农村的实际。农人是不会到城市里来宣传的。关于地主阶级的罪行，非经过实地观察是不会透彻了解的，因而也就不能了解他们的罪恶是怎样一个足以阻碍新中国发展的力量。反之，地主不但能够逃避到城市来宣传，他们又有若干义务宣传员。阶级立场自然会使他们夸大土地改革中的过左偏差；这些恶意的夸大往往很容易传到知识分子耳中，因为我们所接触的人物有不少是地主阶级或与地主阶级有关的。于是，我们的阶级立场就容易模糊起来。土地改革既是农民和地主算总账的斗争，那么，偏差原是难免的，即使不是可以鼓励的，至少是可以原谅的。刚参加土地改革时，我曾懊悔选择到中南区去参观，因为我知道我们“湖南蛮子”是敢于斗争的，何况又有一九二七年的血债；我担心遇到过左的偏差更会模糊我的阶级立场。已有心理准备的我，看过热烈的斗争场面以后，大出望外。这时，我佩服干部掌握纠偏指示的能力，同时我又觉得进行斗争时不免过于温和。（据若干朋友——其中也有地主——的报道，现在已经是普遍没有偏差；已往假使有偏差，公道往往是站在农民一边的。）“过于温和”的感觉当然是错误的，然而表示出我们已开始有明确的阶级立场：农民的诉苦博得我们的同情，地主的硬挺换得我们的憎恨；——这还只是感情上的。可是，农民的诉苦使我们更了解封建剥削之残酷，了解封建生产的落后性，地主的破坏与顽固使我们更了解阶级斗争必然是尖锐的；于是引导我们到理智的考虑：假使认定土地改革是建设新中国的必需条件，则地主阶级是必须打垮的；假使新中国的命运和我们的命运是休戚相关，我们就必须站在农民的一面，不能旁观。当我们看见地主在斗争中硬挺到底时，我们不但每个人在情绪上支持农民，同时也认定有应该如何帮他们一点忙的责任。我们讨论出一些“秀才”方法，当然无补于实际，然而这已说明了我们不单是来参观的，实际已具有参加斗争的意义。此后，我们碰到其他问题时，我们也就自然而然地一致站在农民的一面，希望尽一点力量来帮助解决；我们团体回到北京以后，我们仍然不曾放弃这样的努力。思想上这么逐步发展的结果，使我放弃了“土地改革直接与我无关”的错觉，并且使我答复了为什么要一边倒的问题——两年来在思想上一直搞不通的一个问题。
    参观土地改革使我这么认识了革命。这种认识不是从结论不是从阅读和讨论中得来的，而是农民教给我的。同时，我还得向农民学习如何实践，因为，这种理论认识在我看来仍然是水准很高的，离实践还有相当距离。
  第二、从土地改革体验了实践
    参观土地改革以后，我才懂得土地改革不是一个刻板式的工作。政策和步骤固然是一致的，但在处理个别问题时，并非到处一律；就是县与县之间，甚至乡与乡之间也可能彼此不同。这就是实践的结果。因为要针对实际情况来解决问题，所以不能是机械的，而必然是辩证的。我曾经想：土地改革既是从少数人阶级手里把土地拿出来分给为数最多的阶级，是个何等重大而细密的工作，关于田亩的丈量，土性的鉴别，户口的调查，都是事先必得制定方案动员专家去完成的。这是多么机械的书生之见！
    喜欢说俏皮话的政论家，曾经把中国农民称为四万万阿斗；除了愚昧之外，他们还要担当自私的罪名。在进行土地改革时，他们不再是阿斗，反而是若干集体诸葛亮；至于不自私一点，至少表现得要比知识分子强。所以能够如此，由于有正确的群众路线。关于群众路线，在这里我只想指明：只有群众路线才能产生可以实践的集体智慧，才能产生可以实践的忘我精神。群众是由干部发动，部干领导的。如果干部牵着群众的鼻子走，群众就变成阿斗；如果他做了群众的尾巴，说不定就要出偏差。群众之所以能实践，只缘干部也能实践；干部相信群众，与群众结合在一起，并不是如我们所想像的站在群众头上，是这样，才能够使群众产生实践所必需的智慧与忘我精神。
    农民的文化水平是不高的，且看他们如何发挥集体智慧来解决一些困难。听说在所谓“和平土地改革”时期，地主对土地改革法的条文背到比干部还熟，在划阶级时手里拿着土地改革法来吓唬农民。在斗争恶霸和划分阶级的时候，却看不见农民拿着土地改革法，听不见那一个农民引用土地改革法条文。他们学完划阶级以后，只归纳成几条每一个农民都能运用的原则来对付地主；这么几条简单的原则就可以使地主辞穷理屈。划其他阶级，也是用同样的方法。划分阶级这么一个复杂的工作，就这么在短短十几天之内完成。知识分子不免要批评他们“不科学”，然而，他们竟划得如此准确。（正因为考虑到可能不准确，所以在划分阶级以后仍须上级批准。）其次是“勘田”，丈量田亩应当是一个更繁杂的工作。湖南邱陵地带的水田高低不一，田的形状大小是应有尽有，就是使用科学工具的测量专家也会感觉工作不是容易的。农民却连皮尺也不用。他们相信正直老农的经验与判断；在讨论会上推出了几位这样的老农去担任这个工作。我所看见的一组是五位。他们到了每一丘田里，站在不同的地位上，用眼一瞄，脑子里一捉摸，胸中就有数；几个人当面一对，就决定每一丘田的产量是多少（因为田的产量不同，所以湖南一般论产量而不论面积）。在他们看过较大的一丘田以后，我曾分别去问过他们估计的结果，其中四位估计八石五，一位估计八石，可见其估计是相当准确的。估计出一个数目以后，就在写明原有业主佃户自报产量的标志上，再添一项数字，以凭公断。分田也是依照这样的方法，由几位公正老农依照会上决定的原则去分配。分配以后，一方面登记在簿册上，同时把标志上业主的名字和佃户一项用刀削去，换上分得土地的农民的名字。这样的办法可能不是百分之百的准确——“不科学”，然而在基本上已解决了问题，不曾引起严重的争执。在旁听准备生产的小组会上，特别使我注意的是讨论水利问题的结果。在已往，为着争水可以打架以至打官司。今后要在原灌溉系统之下合理地解决水源问题，当然更困难。他们在否定若干行不通的办法之后，决定了这么一个办法：由原灌溉系统所及的田亩之新业主共推一人“看水”；他所费的劳力，由其他农人在另外的劳作上来补偿。这是何等干脆而能实践的办法！
    集体智慧虽然解决了不少与农民切身利害有关的问题，但不足以说明农民之不自私。农民的自私原不亚于知识分子的自私；只因他们在土地改革过程中教育了自己，认识了团结的力量，因而就真正减轻了个人主义的自私心。勘田和分田并非绝对准确的，然而农民都高兴接受，一致表示：“那里能够一点不差？”因此，因斗争而退出的押金并非全数还给原来付出押金的佃户；分配家具时几乎办到各取所需的原则，而不斤斤较量家具的金钱价值；分配房屋时也只照顾各人的需要。尤其值得注意的是代工队之组织，这是生产小组会上讨论的主要问题之一：除决定轮流代孤寡及参军家属劳动以外，更议定了“先人后我”的原则，怪不得农村青年会那样踊跃参军。
    农民并不如我们所想像的那么保守而反对科学。相反的，只要你能说服他们，他们很愿接受科学。在生产小组会上，他们就多数赞成选用称为“胜利籼”的新种。他们不反对科学，但不因嚷着科学而违反实际。他们的文化水平可能不很高，然而他们能实践，说到那里，做到那里。在农村中看不见形式主义。自私心可能是免不了的，但是个人主义的思想克服一分，在行动上也就表现一分。嘴里只唱高调而行为仍然落后的人物，在农村中几乎是看不见的。我想，知识分子要学习“实践论”，不妨向农民看齐；先且别嚷嚷，一点一滴地从实践上做起。
    农民的实践精神，也启发我去解决学问上的问题。读了二十多年的法国革命史；法国革命时的土地政策何以会失败，直到参观土地改革以后我才得到一个正确的解释。关于这个问题，牵涉太多，只好另写专文来讨论；在这里，我只想说明我的结论。素来对于这次失败的解释是：罗伯斯庇尔派的政敌破坏这个政策之进行；农民不觉悟，不曾起来支持这个政策；罗伯斯庇尔派失败，土地政策也就跟着失败。法国革命史的一代权威马迪厄和最前进的专家，都不曾提出更进一步的解释。现在我才明白罗伯斯庇尔派只是机械唯物论者，不懂得辩证法，因而不懂得实践论。书斋中拟出的政策，老是在议会和衙门里兜圈子，不曾把它交给群众；群众无从发挥其实践精神，甘心作阿斗；于是本可起大作用的政策就等于空文。由此可见参观土地改革对于每一个学术工作者的业务可能有所启发，其作用不限于使我们认识现实及改造思想而已。
  第三、从土地改革预见新中国的前途
    参观过土地改革的人，都能预见到土地改革后的新中国会有一个史无前例的繁荣。
    一、政治：土地改革建政后的农村，人人劳动，不劳动而又破坏秩序的分子，在农村中将不能生存。在参观没收果实的时候，沿途看见少年儿童队在警戒着；我当时想，这么一个热闹的场面正是孩子们嬉弄捣乱的机会，经过组织以后，他们不但不会阻碍工作，反而能起积极作用。于是我进一步认识组织的力量，同时也认识到有关老解放区儿童队的故事之真实性。复次，在全国土地改革完成以后，把有关土地分配的资料结集起来，不难得出一个相当正确的人口总数和田亩总数；土地改革就这么附带地完成一个历史上所从来不曾完成过的行政任务——全国人口调查和田籍调查。这于新中国的发展，将会有何等巨大的意义。
    二、经济：农民分得土地不受剥削以后，由于生产情绪高，合作精神强，加以政府的帮助和科学的指示，生产增加之速是毫无疑问的。粮食的增产，农村购买力的增大和农村劳动力的剩余，为发展工业解决了一半问题；而土地改革政策极力保护工商业，又为工商业发展留下了一个基础。我们不难预料到新中国经济建设的繁荣，同时，也可预料到农村面貌的加速进步。在已往，我曾设想到由小土地所有制过渡到集体农场制将是很困难的一着，因为我曾认定农民的土地占有欲和保守性很强；从农民的实践精神看来，我这种看法又是过虑，只要条件具备了，过渡到集体农场将是很自然的。
    三、国防：政治和经济向前发展，国防当然也跟着向前发展；在这里，我只想指出兵源的问题。农村秩序好，已为国家节省了不知若干兵力，因为再不需要驻军。在保家卫国的爱国主义号召之下，农村参军之热烈，又是我们所不能想像的，几乎每一个乡都超出了它所预期的数目。当我们在长沙黄花乡参观区人民法庭时，正是各乡陆续欢送参军到区上的时候、使我们有机会和多数参军青年接触。“打倒地主就要打倒美帝国主义”的认识，造成了若干争先参军的动人故事；在这么一种认识与热情之下，我们的国家将是一个再不会被人欺侮的国家。
    四、文化：农民容易接受文化。翻身的农民马上就能接受政治教育，就能理解相当高度水准的政治理论。能够想，想得很好；能够说，说得不错。他们在小组会议上发言，入情入理，在使用新名辞时不犯错误；因此我们再无须过虑农民不懂知识分子的谈话，只要没有口音的隔阂。我们参观团中有一位语言学家说：“我已动摇了农民不易认识汉字的看法”；汉字如何改良是另一问题，农民容易接受文化，却是铁一般的事实。同时，农民也在热烈地要求文化。不能读，不能写，没有文化，是他们的苦恼，他们要摆脱这些苦恼。我们看见了农民识字班和黑板报，据参观过江西土地改革的朋友说，他已看到由小学教师领导的农民读报小组。消灭农村文盲是指日可待的事；他们的要求，却不仅在识字而已。农民说：“土地房屋可以分，文化不能分！”又说：“以前只有地主送孩子读书，现在我们也该送孩子读书。”在经济条件许可之下，他们将大批送子弟进学校。所以我们的中学大学要向工农开门，否则他们会自动跑来敲门。农民教育了我，同时我也体验到农民要求我们去教育他们。在向同学们报告土地改革观感时，我曾强调这一点：农民在期待你们的帮助，不管你是学那一门的。现在，我仍想强调这一点：农民在期待每一个学术工作者的努力与帮助，不管你是学什么的。我想，农民既已教育我认识了革命，体验到实践；假使这点教育应起作用的话，我便该在本岗位工作上努力，依着思想水平的提高，逐步实践，以便在建设人民文化的工作上尽我的一点力量来报答农民。
    最后，我想用一句最简单的话来结束我在参观土地改革中的观感和这一篇文章：土地改革以后，新中国是有前途的，每个愿为人民而劳动的人也是有前途的。              （转载光明日报）
