Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 5th: The Four Power Foreign Minister Assistants' Conference continued on the 4th, chaired by Soviet representative Gromyko.

　　Gromyko continued to comment on the new suggestions made by the Western Three Powers on the 2nd. He pointed out that it is reasonable and correct to first discuss the issue of reducing armaments and troops, and then discuss the level of armaments and troops, as well as supervision. Secondly, what should be discussed and resolved by the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is the issue of reducing the troops of the four powers, not the issue of general reduction of troops. Opposing this suggestion is equivalent to refusing to reduce troops.

　　Gromyko then put forward new suggestions from the Soviet delegation. He pointed out that the new suggestions were drafted not only based on the proposals made by the Soviet Union, but also based on some of the most important suggestions made by the Western Three Powers. The new suggestions of the Soviet delegation are as follows: "Study the causes and consequences of the existing international tension in Europe and the measures necessary to obtain a genuine and lasting improvement in the relations between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France, including the the following issues: the issue of eliminating German militarism; the issue of measures to reduce the armaments and troops of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France; the issue of the current level of armaments and troops and the establishment of corresponding international supervision; the issue of fulfilling existing treaty obligations and agreements; the issue of eliminating the threat of war and fear of aggression."

　　Gromyko also stated that the Soviet delegation believes that the important issues of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the US military bases in various countries, as well as the Trieste issue, must be included in the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

　　Representatives of the Western Three Powers stated that they reserved the right to speak on the content of the new Soviet suggestions later. U.S. Representative Jessup and British Representative Davies expressed preliminary opinions, still insisting on listing the issue of armament levels as the first item and replacing the reduction of troops of the four powers with the general reduction of armaments.

　　Gromyko refuted this unfounded argument and hoped that the representatives of the three countries would accept the new Soviet suggestions after thoroughly understanding them.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 6th: Gromyko, head of the Soviet delegation to the Four Power Foreign Minister Assistants' Conference, hosted a banquet on the 5th to entertain the heads of the French delegation to the conference, Mr. Parodi, the head of the US delegation, Mr. Jessup, the head of the British delegation, Mr. Davies and their assistants.

　　Informal exchanges of views took place at the banquet. The meeting originally scheduled for the 5th was canceled. The next meeting is scheduled for the 6th.

　　四国外长助理会议继续举行
　  葛罗米柯再提新建议
　  强调肃清德国军国主义的重要性
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎五日讯：四国外长助理会议于四日继续举行，由苏联代表葛罗米柯任主席。
    葛罗米柯对西方三国于二日提出的新建议继续加以评论。他指出：只有首先讨论裁减军备和军队的问题，然后再谈军备和军队水平以及监督的问题，才是合理而且正确的。其次，应由四国外长会议讨论和解决的，是裁减四国军队的问题，而不是普遍裁减军队的问题。反对这个建议，就等于拒绝裁减军队。
    葛罗米柯接着提出苏联代表团的新建议。他指出：新建议不仅是根据苏联所提出的而且也是根据西方三国所提出的若干最为重要的建议而拟订的。苏联代表团的新建议如下：“研究欧洲现存国际紧张局势的原因与后果以及为获致苏、美、英、法四国关系的真正而持久的改善所必需的措施，其中包括下列各项问题：关于肃清德国军国主义问题；关于裁减苏、美、英、法四国军备与军队的措施问题；关于现存军备与军队水平与建立相应的国际监督的问题；关于履行现存条约义务与协定的问题；关于消除战争威胁与侵略恐惧的问题。”
    葛罗米柯又称：苏联代表团认为，必须将具有重要意义的关于北大西洋公约与美国在各国的军事基地问题以及的里雅斯特问题列入外长会议议程。
    西方三国代表表示保留以后就苏联新建议的内容发言的权利。美国代表耶塞普和英国代表戴维斯发表了初步意见，仍然坚持把军备水平问题列为第一项和以普遍裁减军备代替裁减四国军队的主张。
    葛罗米柯驳斥了这种毫无理由的论据，并希望三国代表在彻底了解苏联的新建议之后加以接受。
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社巴黎六日讯：苏联出席四国外长助理会议代表团团长葛罗米柯，于五日设宴招待出席这次会议的法国代表团团长巴罗第、美国代表团团长耶塞普、英国代表团团长戴维斯和他们的助手。
    席上，曾非正式交换意见。原定五日举行的会议取消。下次会议定于六日举行。
