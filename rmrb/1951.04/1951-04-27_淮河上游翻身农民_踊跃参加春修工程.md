　　More than 500,000 migrant workers from eight special districts in Henan Province, in the upper reaches of the Huai River, have arrived at the Huai River control construction site one after another. On approximately 80,000 square kilometers of land, stretching north to the Longhai Railway, west to the Funiu Mountains, south to the Dabie Mountains, and east to the border between Henan and Anhui, a vivid scene of emancipated peasants fighting against nature is unfolding.
    This year's spring repair project in the upper reaches of the Huai River focuses on the construction of valley reservoirs, while also focusing on the management of the Hong, Ru, and other rivers. The entire project includes five major items: valley reservoirs, lowland flood storage, river channel management, ditches and soil and water conservation. Before the start of the above projects, considerable preparation work was carried out in various places. In general, the masses were told about the suffering caused by floods through representative meetings or mass meetings, and anti-American and aid-Korea education was carried out at the same time, which enlightened the masses' political consciousness. As a result, migrant workers who voluntarily signed up to participate in the Huai River control were extremely enthusiastic, and many counties exceeded the original quota. After the start of work, various places adopted mutual assistance methods such as substitute farming, exchange work, or helping work to solve the contradiction between migrant workers' Huai River control and spring farming production. In terms of cadre allocation, in addition to the original technical personnel transferred from East China and Central South China, thousands of cadres were transferred from each special district to run training courses to learn simple engineering technology and project management. In Xinyang Special District alone, 2,228 cadres at the county, district, and township levels, 337 land surveyors, and 130 students from various schools assisting in the Huai River control participated in the study. In terms of health work, in addition to the central and Henan provincial epidemic prevention teams as the backbone, a large number of medical personnel were mobilized to participate in the health work of the Huai River control construction site.
    Now, several highways leading to the construction site have been built, and a large number of engineering materials, grain, coal, and medicines have been continuously transported to the construction site. On the vast Huanghuai Plain and the continuous Tongbai Mountains of Henan Province, the vast number of migrant workers are carrying out the spring repair project in the upper reaches of the Huai River in an orderly manner.

　　淮河上游翻身农民
    踊跃参加春修工程
    淮河上游河南省境内八个专区的五十余万民工已先后到达治淮工地。在北至陇海铁路、西至伏牛山区，南至大别山区，东至河南、安徽交界处，约八万平方公里的土地上，正展开翻身农民向大自然作斗争的生动场面。
    今年淮河上游的春修工程是以修建山谷水库为主，同时有重点地整理洪、汝等河流。全部工程包括山谷水库、洼地蓄洪、河道整理、沟洫与水土保持等五大项。在上述工程动工前，各地都进行了相当充分的准备工作。一般地区均通过召开代表会或群众大会的方式，向群众讲诉遭受水灾的苦楚，同时进行抗美援朝教育，启发了群众的政治觉悟，结果自动报名参加治淮的民工极为踊跃，许多县份都超过了原定名额。动工后，各地又分别采取了代耕、换工或帮工等互助办法，解决了民工们治淮与春耕生产的矛盾问题。在干部配备上，除原有由华东、中南两区调来的技术人员外，各专区又抽调出数千名干部，开办了训练班，学习简单的工程技术与工程管理。其中仅信阳专区参加学习的即有县、区、乡各级干部二千二百二十八人、收方员三百三十七人及协助治淮工作的各校学生一百三十人。在卫生工作方面，除以中央及河南省防疫队为骨干外，各地又动员了大批医务人员参加治淮工地的卫生工作。
    现在，数条通达工地的公路已经修成，大批的工程器材、粮、煤及医药用品均已源源运抵工地。在河南省辽阔的黄淮平原上和群山连绵的桐柏山区，广大民工正有次序地进行着淮河上游的春修工程。
