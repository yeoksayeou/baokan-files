Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 6th: According to a report in the Canadian Tribune on the 2nd, Tim Buck, General Secretary of the Labour-Progressive Party of Canada, wrote a letter to Canadian Prime Minister St. Laurent, requesting the Canadian government not to support the U.S. war policy of aggression against China. The letter stated: "MacArthur's use of his proximity to the 38th parallel as an opportunity to present a belligerent ultimatum to the people of Korea and China has greatly shocked the world." The letter also stated: "The attempt to invade People's China is a criminal, suicidal, and hopeless adventure. This aggression must not succeed. The only result of this aggression is the unnecessary sacrifice of millions of lives, including the lives of Canadian children, for the profits of monopoly capitalists, in a futile struggle for American domination of Asia." Buck said: "The Labour-Progressive Party demands that your government no longer appease the American war group and publicly declare that Canada severs relations with the suicidal war policy of aggression against China. The majority of Canadian people oppose the Korean War and advocate that your government recognize China."

    【新华社布拉格六日电】据加拿大论坛报二日报道：加拿大劳工进步党总书记巴克（前译布克）曾写信给加拿大总理圣劳伦，要求加拿大政府不要支持美国侵略中国的战争政策。信中说：“麦克阿瑟利用他的接近三八线，作为向朝鲜与中国人民提出好战的哀的美敦书的机会，此举使世人大为震惊。”信中又说：“侵略人民中国的企图是犯罪的、自杀的与毫无希望的冒险。这种侵略决不能得逞。这种侵略的唯一结果，是为垄断资本家的利润而无谓地牺牲千百万条生命，包括加拿大孩子们的生命在内，为美国对亚洲的统治进行徒然无功的斗争。”巴克说：“劳工进步党要求你的政府不能再绥靖美国的战争集团，并公开宣布加拿大与自杀的侵略中国的战争政策断绝关系。大多数加拿大人民都反对朝鲜战争，主张你的政府承认中国。”
