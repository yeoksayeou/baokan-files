　　The Pioneer Who Spreads Advanced Soviet Technology
　　Wang Qi
　　Yu Yunhai is an engineer with twenty years of experience. With the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, he successively repaired two large generators, giving new life to two old machines that had been broken for many years. Therefore, Engineer Yu's reputation spread throughout China's electrical industry. He himself also went through a complex struggle process, transforming from an old technician into a new people's engineer.
　　Many of the machines in China's power plants were, during the period of Japanese occupation and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, in disrepair for many years and operating in extremely poor condition, like old cows pulling broken carts. After liberation, some technicians still had ideological obstacles and never attached importance to "regular maintenance" in the electrical industry. Some cadres believed that the machines were too old and that it would be better to buy new ones than to repair them. As a result, the output and utilization rate of generators were very low, and there were many accidents. Since the first National Electrical Industry Conference last year, although electrical workers in various places have gradually begun to correct this view, more than one-fifth of the installed capacity of public and private power plants across the country is still frozen and unable to be utilized. This is a huge waste. Now the industrial electricity consumption across the country is increasing day by day. It takes a long time to build new power plants, but it is relatively quick to restore these frozen power equipment. Therefore, strengthening regular maintenance so that machines can exert their due effectiveness has become a primary task in the electrical industry. Engineer Yu happened to open up a new path in this regard.
　　On September 14, 1949, the largest generator in the Shijingshan Power Plant suffered a serious damage accident. The entire rotor (the most important part of the generator) was destroyed. At that time, the situation in the factory was very chaotic. This chaotic situation can be explained by the following colloquialisms: "Two hours wandering around before and after work, four hours busy with accidents, two hours dealing with things." Engineer Yu was the director of the Shijingshan Power Plant at that time, and he was resting in the hospital when the generator accident occurred. At that time, the Central Fuel Industry Department attached great importance to this matter, held a special meeting to investigate, and instructed Engineer Yu to be responsible for repairing the generator. Soviet experts from the Central Fuel Industry Department personally went to the Shijingshan Power Plant to help Engineer Yu. As soon as the Soviet experts arrived at the factory, they put forward many suggestions, but they encountered great ideological resistance. Many technicians did not know what Soviet technology was like, but they knew about German and American technology. They thought: If outstanding German and American engineers can't deal with such machines, how can Soviet experts do it?! Needless to say, even Engineer Yu, who already had some understanding of Soviet technology from Russian books, could not accept the technical suggestions of the Soviet experts at this time. At first, Engineer Yu argued with the Soviet experts, feeling that he had twenty years of experience and had read many Soviet books, and that he would know what the Soviet experts knew. He also wondered whether the Soviet technology was good, but whether this expert was a first- or second-rate expert? Did he have experience with such complex machines? He had a big question mark in his mind.
　　In old China, Engineer Yu studied at the Harbin Institute of Technology. When he worked at the Harbin Power Plant, it was during the Japanese imperialist occupation of Northeast China. Engineer Yu was treated inhumanly by the Japanese imperialists there: Chinese technicians were inferior to foreign ones and could not hold their heads up. When the Shijingshan Power Plant had not yet been liberated, the Kuomintang reactionaries invited American imperialist engineers. Engineer Yu only had one conclusion about Japanese or American engineers: they would only enslave and would not help the Chinese people. Therefore, Engineer Yu once received Soviet experts with this feeling. But what about the Soviet experts? They consulted with Engineer Yu everywhere, and when there were problems, they always raised them first and studied them with Engineer Yu. When there was no agreement, Engineer Yu found Soviet books to testify, and the Soviet experts patiently explained that this theory was already outdated and that the Soviet working people were constantly creating new experiences. In the frequent contacts between Engineer Yu and the Soviet experts, he gradually changed his views on the Soviet experts. Finally, one thing completely changed Engineer Yu's view of the Soviet experts. In the past, when the blades of Chinese steam turbines were damaged, they had to be purchased from foreign countries. After the Soviet experts arrived in Shanghai, they found that there were three factories in Shanghai that could make such blades. Engineer Yu did not know about this, and neither did many other people. After the Soviet experts discovered this, they said to Engineer Yu: Why buy from other countries when our own country can manufacture these blades? The quality of those made in our own country may not be as good as those made in foreign countries, but if we don't order from our own factories, the quality will never improve. Perhaps those made in our own country will be more expensive, but it is much better than a large amount of funds flowing to foreign countries. This series of words from the Soviet experts, filled with internationalist friendship, made Engineer Yu both ashamed and moved! He remembered that during the Kuomintang rule, American imperialist engineers had also come to the Shijingshan Power Plant. An American engineer said to Engineer Yu: You can't use this machine (referring to the generator that was damaged and waiting to be repaired) at all. You can only throw it into the sea and buy a simpler machine from us in America, which you Chinese people can use. What a sharp contrast! It made Engineer Yu understand who China's real friends were!
　　However, going from understanding to practice still requires many complex processes. Although Engineer Yu believed in the superiority of Soviet technology, he had no way to convince others. The Soviet experts had suggested that the steam-water separator in front of the main steam valve of the machine be removed and that the separator be connected to the steam-water ejector. When Engineer Yu was preparing to do this, some workers objected, thinking that doing so would cause water to enter the steam-water ejector, making it impossible to create a vacuum. They were reluctant to carry out the plan for a long time. After many twists and turns, it was done according to the Soviet experts' advice. As soon as the machine was running, there was the sound of water inside, and everyone complained that the removal of the steam-water separator had caused damage. Later, when it was dismantled, it was found that other pipes had been connected incorrectly. After reconnecting the pipes and testing the machine again, there was no water sound. The result of this transformation increased the machine's output and saved steam. There were many similar things. As long as the workers said, "I've never seen it before" or "It's always been like this," Engineer Yu didn't know how to do it well and felt very sad and discouraged. After work, he returned to the dormitory, lay on the bed, and asked himself: "Didn't the Party, the administration, and the trade union help you? Don't you have technology? Why can't you still do it well?!" He felt very small. Once, the Party branch secretary of the Shijingshan Power Plant talked to him from evening to the next morning. The branch secretary advised Engineer Yu to put down his airs and learn honestly from the workers. He said that technology can only truly play a role when it is mastered by the masses. Engineer Yu received such help and was enlightened by the Soviet experts, and his thinking changed greatly. Later, when he made a technical decision, he would first consult and study with technicians and veteran workers. Engineer Yu had always believed that "democracy cannot be discussed in technology, and discussing democracy will delay things." The fact was exactly the opposite. When advanced technology was combined with the working masses, it exerted unparalleled power. The generator that the Japanese imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the American imperialist engineers had been unable to deal with for more than a decade was finally repaired in the hands of the people.
　　The repair of the Shijingshan generator opened the eyes of all the employees of the plant and strengthened Engineer Yu's confidence. In April 1950, Engineer Yu, with this confidence, went to Fushun with Soviet experts to repair a certain generator. This generator was also manufactured by the Japanese Mitsubishi factory and had been in use for more than ten years. Since the accident in 1933, it had not been operating well and had not been able to exert its due effectiveness. After inspection by Soviet experts, it was determined that the main problem was vibration and that the load could not be increased. In response to these problems, Soviet experts proposed a maintenance plan and method. The most difficult of these was finding dynamic balance. Finding dynamic balance was a new method. In the past, static balance was found. According to the Soviet experts' suggestion, the 22-ton rotor had to be placed on a balancing platform and rotated by another motor to find balance. No one had ever seen this work done, and no one dared to do it, fearing that it would cause trouble.
　　Engineer Yu was appointed as the person in charge of repairing this generator. At first, he did not dare to accept this task. When repairing the turbine at the Shijingshan Power Plant, Engineer Yu mainly had to overcome his lack of confidence. After arriving in Fushun, Engineer Yu knew that he would encounter greater ideological resistance. The workers, technicians, and most of the cadres of the Fushun Power Plant believed that after the Japanese surrendered, the Kuomintang bandits had destroyed the machines and that in order to avoid accidents and increase output, it was only possible to replace the large cover and the rotor blades, which would cost a lot of money; otherwise, it would be impossible. After the repair began, all of these doubts were directed at Engineer Yu, hindering the most important work of finding dynamic balance. However, Engineer Yu believed in the Soviet experts' advice, and the leaders often encouraged him. The Soviet experts encouraged Engineer Yu: When we do something, we should estimate the possibility of failure. Only by learning again and again will we become smarter. Although Engineer Yu went through two reworkings, which caused attacks from conservative thinking, his confidence became stronger and stronger with the constant support of the leaders. Fushun's generator was finally completely repaired on September 29, 1950, after one hundred and sixty-one days. After this generator was repaired, it was like a new machine that had just left the factory, and its output reached 100% of its original capacity. Many engineers at the Fushun Power Plant were very surprised that the Japanese could not repair it in the past, but now we Chinese people have actually repaired it. This is really a miracle! Yes, this is a miracle, and in Engineer Yu's personal experience, the root of the miracle was discovered: "There is no second direction. Our Chinese technicians can only learn advanced technology from the Soviet Union."
　　At the first National Electrical Industry Conference last year, it was after the damage to a certain generator at the Shijingshan Power Plant. Engineer Yu was given a dismissal punishment. One year later, at the second National Electrical Industry Conference in March of this year, Engineer Yu gave a typical report introducing his experience in learning advanced Soviet technology. He frankly said: Before the accident with a certain generator at the Shijingshan Power Plant, I knew that there was something wrong with the machine and that there were many problems in the factory. At that time, I was not so ill that I could not get out of bed, but I put down my work and went to recuperate. After the accident, Chen Yu, director of the Central Fuel Industry Department, said at the review meeting: We must regard the machine as more important than our own body. At that time, I felt very ashamed, especially when the Party branch secretary of the Shijingshan Power Plant tearfully reviewed his request for double punishment, which moved me very much. So I decided to atone for my crimes and asked to repair the damaged generator, making the greatest determination not to enter the city or go home until the generator was repaired. In the meantime, Engineer Yu also changed. Now Engineer Yu is a new engineer armed with advanced technology, a glorious people's engineer! He has been to Harbin, Jiamusi, and Tianjin, helping the power plants there discover machine problems and solve them, and has received unanimous praise. At the second National Electrical Industry Conference, he received an award from the presidium of the conference, and all the representatives of the second National Electrical Industry Conference also passed a proposal requesting the government to consider revoking Engineer Yu's punishment in 1949. Engineer Yu told others what the Soviet experts had told him, which he had also personally verified: "Serving the people wholeheartedly, the sooner one understands this truth, the greater one's happiness will be." Let us hope that more and more Yu Yunhais will appear on the economic construction front of our motherland!

　　传播苏联先进技术的披荆斩棘者
    汪琦
    于运海是一个有二十年经验的工程师。他得到苏联专家的热心帮助，先后修复了两台较大的发电机，使两台破旧多年的老机器获得了新的生命。因此，于工程师的声誉传遍了中国电业界。他自己也经过了一个复杂的斗争过程，由一个旧的技术人员变成了新的人民工程师。
    我国许多发电厂的机器，在日寇和国民党反动统治时期，多是多年失修，运转情况非常恶劣，就像老牛破车一样。解放以后，若干技术人员还有保守思想的障碍，始终未将电业中的“定期检修”重视起来。一般干部认为机器都老掉牙了，与其修理，还不如买新的。于是，发电机的出力和利用率都很低，事故很多。自从去年第一次全国电业会议以来，各地电业工作者虽然已开始逐渐纠正这一观点，但目前全国公私营电厂的设备容量，仍有五分之一以上被冻结着未能利用。这是一种极大的浪费。现在全国工业用电日益增加。增建新的电厂需时颇久，恢复这些冻结了的发电设备，却是比较快的。因此，加强定期检修，使机器发生应有的效能，便成了电业工作中一个首要的任务。于工程师恰巧在这方面打开了一条新的道路。
    一九四九年九月十四号，石景山发电厂最大的一台发电机发生了严重的损坏事故。整个回转子（发电机里最重要的一部分）毁了。而当时该厂的情况是很混乱的。这种混乱情况，可用下面几句口头语来说明：“上班前后两个钟头转游转游，四个钟头忙于事故，两个钟头应付应付。”于工程师当时是石景山发电厂的厂长，这台发电机发生事故时，他正在医院里休养。当时中央燃料工业处对这件事非常重视，专门开了会检查，并指令于工程师负责修复这台发电机。中央燃料工业处的苏联专家亲自到石景山发电厂去帮助于工程师。苏联专家一到厂里，就提出了许多建议，可是遭到了很大的思想抵抗。许多技术人员并不知道苏联技术究竟如何，但他们知道德国的、美国的。他们想：德国的、美国的高明工程师对这样机器都对付不了，苏联专家那能行呢？！这些不必说了，连在俄文书本上已对苏联技术有些认识的于工程师，这时听到苏联专家的技术建议，一时也接受不了。起初于工程师和苏联专家争论，觉得自己有二十年经验，念了许多苏联书，苏联专家能知道的他也会知道。他还想，苏联技术好他不怀疑，但这个专家是不是一、二流的呢？对这样复杂的机器有没有经验？他心里打了一个大问号。
    于工程师在旧中国时，曾在哈尔滨工业大学念过书。当他在哈尔滨发电厂工作时，正是日本帝国主义侵占东北的时候，于工程师在那里受到了日本帝国主义者的非人待遇：中国的技术人员比外国的低一等，抬不起头来。当石景山发电厂还没有解放时，国民党反动派曾请来美帝国主义的工程师。于工程师对于日本的或美国的工程师，只有一个结论，他们只会奴役，不会帮助中国人，因此，于工程师曾经怀着这种心情接待苏联专家。但是苏联专家呢？处处和于工程师商量，有问题总是先提出来和于工程师研究，在争论不下时，于工程师找出苏联书来作证，苏联专家耐心地解释说：这种理论现在已经陈旧了，苏联劳动人民不断地创造着新的经验，在于工程师和苏联专家频繁的接触中，逐渐改变了对苏联专家的看法。最后，有一件事完全改变了于工程师对苏联专家的看法。过去中国汽轮机的叶片坏了，非向外国购买不可，苏联专家到上海后，发现上海有三个工厂能做这种叶片。这件事情于工程师不知道，其他很多人也不知道。苏联专家发现以后，对于工程师说：自己国里能制造这种叶片，为什么还到别的国家去买呢？自己国里造的也许不如外国好，但是如果不向自己工厂订货，质量永远提不高。也许自己造的要贵一些，但是比起大批资金流到外国去要好得多。苏联专家这一番洋溢着国际主义友情的话，使于工程师又是惭愧又是感动！他想起在国民党统治时期，美帝国主义的工程师也曾到过石景山发电厂，有一个美国工程师对于工程师说：这样机器（指因损坏待修的这台发电机）你们根本就不能用，只有扔到海里去，到我们美国买比较简单的机器，你们中国人才能用。这是何等鲜明的对比啊！它使于工程师理解了中国真正的朋友是谁！
    但是，由认识到实践，还要经过许多复杂的过程。于工程师虽然相信了苏联技术的优越性，但他没有办法说服别人，苏联专家曾建议将该机主蒸汽门前的汽水分离器取消，将分离器接到汽水喷射器上。于工程师准备这样作的时候，有些工友表示反对，他们以为这样做会使汽水喷射器进水，无法抽成真空。迟迟不肯执行。经过许多周折，才按苏联专家的意见做了。机器一运转，又发现里面有水的声音，大家都埋怨开了，说是汽水分离器取消坏了。以后拆开一看，原来是别的管子接错了。重新接了管子再试车，就没有水声了。这样改造的结果，使机器的出力增高而又节省了蒸汽。还有许多类似的事情，只要工人一说“过去没见过”，“从来就这样”，于工程师就不知道怎样办好，就感到非常难过和灰心。工作完了，回到宿舍，躺在床上，自己问自己：“党、行政、工会不是协助你了吗？你不是有技术吗？怎样还搞不好呢！？”他觉得自己很渺小。有一次，石景山发电厂的党的总支书记和他谈话，从晚上谈到第二天早上。总支书记劝于工程师放下架子，老老实实地向工人学。他说，技术只有为群众所掌握，才能真正发生作用。于工程师得到这样的帮助，又得到苏联专家的启示，思想大变了。以后，他决定一件技术上的问题，就先找技术人员、老工人商量、研究。于工程师过去一直认为“技术上是不能讲民主的，讲民主就要耽误事。”事实恰巧相反，当先进技术一与工人群众结合起来，就发挥了无比的力量。日本帝国主义、国民党、美帝国主义工程师十几年来都无法对付的这台发电机，终于在人民手中修理好了。
    石景山发电机的修复，打开了全厂职工的眼界，坚定了于工程师的信心。一九五○年四月，于工程师又带着这种信心，和苏联专家一起到抚顺，检修某号发电机。这台发电机也是日本三菱工厂制造的，已经有十几年历史了，自从一九三三年发生事故以后，一直没有很好的运转，一直未能发挥其应有的效能。经苏联专家检查之后，认为主要的毛病是震动，负荷带不上去，针对这些毛病，苏联专家提出了检修的计划和方法，其中最困难的是找动平衡。找动平衡是个新方法，过去都找静平衡，照苏联专家建议的办法，要将二十二吨回转子放在平衡台上，由别的马达带着转找平衡。这个工作谁也没有见过，都不敢做，怕闹乱子。
    于工程师被指定为检修这台发电机的负责人。一开始，他不敢接受这个任务，修复石景山发电厂那台透平机的时候，于工程师主要是要战胜自己的信心不足。到了抚顺以后，于工程师知道要遭到更大的思想抵抗，抚顺发电厂的工人、技术人员和大多数干部，都认为在日本投降后，国民党匪帮把机器都破坏了，要想不出事故，要提高出力，只有换大盖、换回转子叶片，要花很多钱，否则是不可能的。开始检修以后，所有这一切怀疑都朝向于工程师，阻碍着最重要的找动平衡的工作。可是，于工程师相信苏联专家的建议，领导上又经常鼓励他。苏联专家鼓励于工程师说：我们做一件事应该把失败的可能性估计进去，只有一次又一次地学习，我们才会聪明起来。于工程师虽然经过两次返工，引起保守思想的袭击，但他在领导上不断地支持下，信心越来越加强了。抚顺某号发电机终于经过了一百六十一天的时间，一九五○年九月二十九号完全修好了。这台发电机检修之后，好像才出厂的新机器一样，出力达到了原定容量的百分之百。抚顺发电厂许多工程师都很奇怪，过去日本人修不好，现在咱们中国人居然修好了，这真是一个奇迹！是的，这是一个奇迹，而且由于工程师亲身的体验中，发掘了奇迹产生的根源：“没有第二个方向，我们中国技术人员只有向苏联学习先进技术。”
    在去年第一次全国电业会议时，正是石景山发电厂某号机损坏以后。于工程师受到了撤职处分。时隔一年，在今年三月第二次全国电业会议上，于工程师作了典型报告，介绍他学习苏联先进技术的经验。他诚恳坦白地说：在石景山发电厂某号发电机发生事故以前，我知道机器有毛病，也知道厂里问题很多，当时我自己并非病得不能起床，但我放下工作休养去了。等到事故发生之后，中央燃料工业处陈郁处长在检讨会上说：要把机器看得比自己身体还重要。当时我觉得很惭愧，特别是石景山发电厂党的支部书记声泪俱下检讨自己请求双重处分，使我非常感动，于是我决心带罪立功，请求修复这台损坏的发电机，下最大决心，不修好这台发电机不进城，不回家，终于这台发电机修复了。在这中间于工程师也改变了，现在于工程师已是一个有先进技术武装了的新的工程师，是一个光荣的人民工程师！他到过哈尔滨、佳木斯、天津，帮助那儿的发电厂发现了机器的毛病，解决了问题，得到了一致的好评。在第二次全国电业会议上，他受到了会议主席团给予他的奖励，第二次全国电业会议的全体代表并通过建议请求政府考虑撤消一九四九年对于工程师的处分。于工程师把苏联专家同他说过的，也是他自己亲身体验证实了的一句话告诉别人：“真心为人民服务，谁早一天明白这个道理，谁的幸福就要大一些。”让我们这样期望，在我们祖国的经济建设战线上，出现更多更多的于运海吧！
