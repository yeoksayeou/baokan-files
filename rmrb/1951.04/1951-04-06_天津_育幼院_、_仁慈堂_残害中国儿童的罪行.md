To the Editor:

Last August, I visited the "Nursery" and "Charitable Hall" affiliated with the Tianjin Xikai Catholic Hospital. I discovered that they were both seriously harming our country's children.

The "Nursery" takes in female infants from newborn to six years old. Under the abuse of the hospital, those poor infants were all skin and bones. The food the infants ate, as far as I saw, was just a little bit of extremely thin gruel.

The "Charitable Hall" takes in girls from six to eighteen years old. Outside the children's housing, there is a wooden fence that is locked all day long.

The children mostly work in addition to chanting scriptures. Children as young as five or six years old have to sew sock tops and braid ribbons; slightly older children do drawnwork and embroidery. Although the hospital accepts outside work at a very high price, the children's long hours of work only earn them tattered clothes and undernourished food.

We firmly oppose imperialist elements harming our children under the guise of "charity." We request that the government liberate this group of children, who are still suffering, from the forbidden land of the imperialist elements.

### 天津“育幼院”、“仁慈堂”残害中国儿童的罪行

    天津“育幼院”、“仁慈堂”残害中国儿童的罪行编辑同志：
    去年八月，我曾访问了天津西开天主教医院附设的“育幼院”和“仁慈堂”。我发觉它们都严重地残害着我国的儿童。
    “育幼院”收容的是初生至六岁的女婴。在院方的虐害下，那些可怜的婴儿都瘦得皮包骨头。婴儿们吃的东西，据我所见，只是一点极稀的面糊。
    “仁慈堂”收容六岁至十八岁的女孩。孩子们的住房外面，都有一道一天到晚锁着的木栏子。
    孩子们除了念经以外，大部时间是做工。五、六岁的孩子就要缝袜口、编带子；稍大一点的就挑花、绣花。院方接受外活的定价虽然很高，但孩子们长时间的工作，只换来破旧的衣服和缺乏营养的食品。
    我们坚决反对帝国主义分子披着“慈善”的外衣来残害我国的孩子。我们请求政府把这一群现在还在苦难中的孩子们，从帝国主义分子的禁地里解放出来。
        刘仁心
