The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Propaganda Committee of the Headquarters of the China Democratic League recently instructed local organizations to mobilize all party members, league members, and the masses they are connected with to participate in the May Day demonstration and parade. In its notification, the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang instructed local organizations to combine specific circumstances and flexibly apply the slogans in the "Call for the Celebration of the May 1st Labor Day of 1951" issued by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in order to achieve the effect of internal education and external propaganda. Furthermore, regarding the signing of the petition to support the conclusion of a peace treaty and the voting on the Japanese issue, if local organizations have not had time to hold these activities within this month, they must hold meetings before the May Day demonstration and parade to carry out the signing and voting.

The instructions from the Propaganda Committee of the Headquarters of the China Democratic League specifically stipulate that all branches should hold various small meetings extensively in late April to mobilize the masses to actively participate in the May Day demonstration and parade, and to denounce the crimes of aggression by Japanese and American imperialism, as well as the persecution of the people by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit secret agents, through these meetings. On the basis of enhanced ideological awareness, they should hold the signing of the petition to support the conclusion of a peace treaty and the voting on the Japanese issue. At the same time, all branches should mobilize League members and cultural and educational figures studying in Japan and the United States to write letters to their American and Japanese friends, jointly opposing the arming of Japan by the United States, and striving for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.

The instructions emphasize that if any branches have not yet determined plans for popularizing and deepening the movement to resist America and aid Korea, they should immediately formulate specific plans based on local conditions and implement them; if plans have already been formulated, they should pay attention to timely summarization and inspection, and strive for thorough completion.

　　民革中央和民盟总部指示各地组织
    动员党员盟员及群众
    参加“五一”节大示威
    中国国民党革命委员会中央委员会、中国民主同盟总部宣传委员会，日前分别指示各地组织，动员全体党员、盟员和所联系的群众参加五一节示威游行。中国国民党革命委员会中央委员会的通知中，指示各地，结合具体情况，就人民政协全国委员会所发布的“为庆祝一九五一年五一劳动节的号召”中的口号，分别采取灵活运用，以期收到对内教育和对外宣传的效果。又关于拥护缔结和平公约签名及关于日本问题的投票，各地组织如有在本月内未及举行的，须于五一节示威游行前先行集会，进行签名投票。
    中国民主同盟总部宣传委员会的指示中具体规定：各支分部应于四月下旬广泛举行各种小型会议，动员群众积极参加五一节示威大游行，并通过这些会议控诉日、美帝国主义侵略以及蒋匪特务迫害人民的罪行。在思想觉悟提高的基础上，举行拥护缔结和平公约的签名和关于日本问题的投票。同时，各支分部应动员留日、留美盟员和文教界人士写信给他们的美国朋友和日本朋友，共同反对美国武装日本，并为争取对日缔结全面和约而奋斗。
    该指示中着重指出：各支分部如还有未确定普及和深入抗美援朝运动计划的，应即根据当地具体情况，迅速拟订具体计划，并即着手实行；倘已订定计划，则应注意及时总结和检查，力求贯彻完成。
