　　Establishing Notarization Work to Protect State Property

　　Some private enterprises and merchants, when entering into contracts with public entities, inherit the habits and practices of the old society, disregard the policies and laws of the People's Government, and violate contracts through speculation, trickery, and fraud. The Tianjin Municipal People's Court handled 144 such cases in a six-month period from March to August last year, involving disputed debts totaling more than 25 billion yuan. In Zhejiang last spring, fifteen private merchants were entrusted to reel autumn cocoons and raw silk, but due to shoddy workmanship and substandard quality, a large amount of foreign exchange was lost and reduced. If this situation continues to develop, it will inevitably cause serious losses to state property and economic construction, and will affect the legitimate operation and development of the vast number of private enterprises and merchants.

　　These illegal acts of private enterprises and merchants must be corrected. They must be educated to raise their awareness. Government agencies, especially enterprise, trade departments, and military logistics agencies, should adopt a serious attitude when trading and contracting with private enterprises and merchants, and overcome complacency and bureaucratic practices. A certain legal procedure should be followed to ensure public-private transactions are legally guaranteed and eliminate the possibility of speculation by private merchants.

　　The notarization work of the Nanchang Municipal People's Court has played a significant role in this regard, preventing the loss of state property and ensuring the execution of public-private contracts. On the contrary, when dealing with such cases, the courts in some areas unilaterally use "taking care of private capital" as a reason, talking about "private before public," believing that it does not matter if the public sector suffers a little loss, and objectively condoning the illegal behavior of some private entrepreneurs and merchants. Some financial and economic personnel do not have a serious enough attitude, believing that this is an unavoidable loss in public-private transactions, and do not actively seek to prevent or remedy it, treating these losses directly as "bad debts," which are all wrong.

　　At present, cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, Harbin, and Shenyang have also implemented notarization systems or notarization services, but the courts in some cities are not good at protecting national interests through the notarization system. The notarization system adopted by the Nanchang Municipal People's Court provides a better approach in this regard. For example, strict review of guarantors and prohibition of guarantees by the same industry are worthy of reference by all regions.

### 建立公证工作保护国家财产

　　建立公证工作保护国家财产
    有些私营企业与私商，在与公家订立契约合同时，因袭旧社会的习惯与作风，藐视人民政府的政策法令，违背契约合同，投机取巧，欺诈套骗。天津市人民法院去年三月至八月六个月中，受理此类案件达一百四十四起，因此纠缠不清的债务折合人民币二百五十多亿。浙江去年春季十五家私商受委托代缫秋茧和生丝，因偷工减料，不合外销标准，损失与减少了大量外汇。这种情况继续发展下去，必然使国家财产、经济建设受到严重损失，并将影响广大私营企业与私商的正当经营与发展。
    必须纠正这些私营企业和私商的不法行为。必须对他们进行教育，提高其觉悟。政府机关特别是企业、贸易部门与军队后勤机关在和私营企业与私商进行交易、订立合同时，应该采取严肃的态度，克服麻痹思想与官僚主义的作风。应该经过一定的司法程序，使公私交易得到法律的保证，杜绝私商投机取巧的可能。
    南昌市人民法院的公证工作，在这一点上起了相当的作用，防止了国家财产的损失，保证了公私合同的执行。相反，某些地区的法院在处理此类案件时，片面地以“照顾私人资本”为理由，讲什么“先私后公”，认为公家损失一点不要紧，客观上纵容了某些私营企业者与私商的不法行为。还有些财经机关人员的态度不够严肃，认为这是公私交易中必不可免的损失，而不积极设法防止补救，把这些损失径做“呆账”处理，这些都是错误的。
    目前北京、天津、上海、青岛、哈尔滨、沈阳等城市也实行了公证制度或公证业务，但有些城市的法院还不善于通过公证制度，保护国家利益。南昌市人民法院所采用的公证制度，在这方面提供了一个比较好的作法。比如对保证商进行严格审查，禁止同业作保等，都是值得各地参考的。
