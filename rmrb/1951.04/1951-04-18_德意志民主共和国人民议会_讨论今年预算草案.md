　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th: According to TASS, Berlin, 12th, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held a meeting on April 11th to discuss the draft national budget for 1951 submitted by the government.

　　Dr. Loch, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of the German Democratic Republic, presented a report to the People's Chamber on the draft national budget for 1951. Loch first reported on the smooth implementation of the 1950 national budget. He emphasized that this achievement was the result of overfulfilling the 1950 economic plan. He said that in 1950, the industrial production plan was exceeded by 9 percent, the average yield per hectare of land exceeded the pre-war level, the number of livestock increased significantly, and transportation improved.

　　As a result of the overall budget execution, a surplus of 466 million marks was achieved, exceeding the original plan by 362 million marks.

　　The draft national budget for 1951 is expected to have a surplus of 729 million marks. The income from the state-owned economic sector in the budget revenue will reach 2.966 billion marks, which is more than double that of last year. The funds used to develop the state-owned economy will reach 2.385 billion marks, about twice that of last year, accounting for 10.5 percent of the total budget expenditure. The funds used to develop agriculture will reach 1.631 billion marks, accounting for 7.2 percent of the total budget expenditure. The funds used to develop cultural and social undertakings will reach 7.416 billion marks, an increase of 25 percent over last year, accounting for about one-third of the total national budget expenditure. The funds used to subsidize youth and develop sports will exceed 500 million marks. The budget also stipulates that a large amount of funds will be used to continue to implement the policy of stabilizing the value of the mark. The expenditure for the Ministry of Interior of the Republic and the Ministries of Interior of the states (including all the People's Police forces) will be reduced by 16 percent compared with 1950, accounting for only 3.26 percent of the total budget.

　　Loch pointed out that this budget shows that the German Democratic Republic is pursuing a policy of peaceful construction. In West Germany, the occupation fees and the cost of re-militarization this year will be as high as 13.15 billion West German marks (one West German mark is equivalent to six German Democratic Republic marks), while the total income of the West German "Federal Republic" in 1950 was only 13 billion marks.

　　德意志民主共和国人民议会
    讨论今年预算草案
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社柏林十二日讯：德意志民主共和国人民议会于四月十一日举行会议，讨论政府提出的一九五一年的国家预算草案。
    德意志民主共和国副总理兼财政部长洛赫博士向人民议会提出了一九五一年度国家预算草案的报告。洛赫首先报告了一九五○年度国家预算顺利执行的情形。他强调指出这个成就是超额完成一九五○年经济计划的结果。他说，在一九五○年，工业生产计划超过百分之九，每公顷土地的平均收获量已超过了战前的水平，牲口的数目大有增加，运输事业也有改进。
    整个预算执行的结果，共赢余四亿六千六百万马克，超过原定计划三亿六千二百万马克。
    一九五一年度的国家预算草案预定要赢余七亿二千九百万马克。预算岁入中征自国营经济部分的收入将达二十九亿六千六百万马克，即比去年增加一倍以上。用于发展国营经济的款项达二十三亿八千五百万马克，约为去年的两倍，占整个预算支出的百分之十点五。用于发展农业的款项达十六亿三千一百万马克，占整个预算支出的百分之七点二。用于发展文化与社会事业的款项将达七十四亿一千六百万马克，即比去年增加百分之二十五，约占整个国家预算支出的三分之一。用于补助青年与发展体育的款项将超过五亿马克。预算并规定以大笔款项，用于继续执行稳定马克币值的政策。用于共和国内务部及各州内务部（包括所有的人民警察部队在内）的支出，将比一九五○年减少百分之十六，在整个预算中只占百分之三点二六。
    洛赫指出，这个预算说明德意志民主共和国奉行和平建设的政策。而在西德，今年的占领费与重新军国主义化的费用将高达一百三十一亿五千万西德马克（一西德马克折合六个德意志民主共和国马克），西德“联邦共和国”一九五○年度的全部收入却不过一百三十亿马克。
