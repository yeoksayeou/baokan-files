　　(I) Strengthening Anti-American Aggression and Aid-Korea Education for the Working Masses
    This issue of the journal publishes an article entitled "Lessons from the Failure of the Patriotic Production Competition in the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau's Telegraph Office," which deserves attention from all regions. As the article points out, the main reason for the failure of the production competition in this enterprise lies in the fact that the Chinese Communist Party branch, the trade union, and the administrative leaders of the enterprise were satisfied with the once "vigorous" anti-American aggression and aid-Korea movement last year. Therefore, they did not persistently carry out systematic and in-depth patriotic propaganda and education on anti-American aggression and aid-Korea among the working masses. Instead, they abandoned such political education and engaged in production competitions in isolation and perfunctorily.

    In the past period, the workers' anti-American and patriotic movement has been of considerable scale. In the past five months, more than 1.64 million workers in various regions have participated in anti-American aggression and aid-Korea rallies and parades, and more than 1.66 million have participated in patriotic production competitions. Due to the increased patriotic awareness of the working masses, new production records have emerged in many local factories and mines, product quality has improved, raw materials have been saved, and costs have been reduced, thereby greatly increasing the country's economic strength.

    However, there are still many localities and many cadres who do not understand the great historical significance of the anti-American aggression and aid-Korea movement, thinking that a "shock movement" is enough to complete the task, or at least it is "almost done." Therefore, they become complacent and do not seriously, persistently, and deeply carry out systematic patriotic education on anti-American aggression and aid-Korea. This phenomenon exists not only in some enterprises in Beijing, but also in some enterprises in other regions. For example, according to Xinhua News Agency materials, many trade union organizations in the Central and Southern China region and the CCP branches of enterprise units do not yet recognize the important significance of anti-American aggression and aid-Korea patriotic education. Some local trade union organizations, and even some provincial trade union organizations, have not yet paid attention to this work. In many enterprises, due to the lack of serious patriotic current affairs and political education, the patriotic production competition has either not been launched at all, or has only been launched in form. In fact, it has not become a conscious patriotic action of the working masses. Some workers even believe that "competition is not just about working more for the factory and the capitalists." In this case, the patriotic production competition will certainly not achieve any results.

    We hope that the leading organs and trade union organizations at all levels in various regions will seriously value and strengthen the propaganda and education work on anti-American aggression and aid-Korea for the working masses. Trade unions at all levels should, in the near future, formulate regular plans for popularizing and deepening the propaganda and education on anti-American aggression and aid-Korea, and assist the Communist Party in establishing propaganda networks in factories and enterprises, so that current affairs and political propaganda and education work can be carried out persistently and regularly, making it a regular driving force for promoting the advancement of China's industrial production.

### （一）加强对工人群众的抗美援朝教育

　　（一）加强对工人群众的抗美援朝教育
    本刊本期发表了《北京市电信局电报处爱国生产竞赛失败的教训》一文，值得引起各地注意。正如该文所指出，这个企业生产竞赛失败的主要原因，在于这个企业的中国共产党支部、职工会和行政负责人员满足于去年一度“轰轰烈烈”的工人抗美援朝运动，因而没有坚持地对工人群众进行抗美援朝的系统的深入的爱国宣传教育，反而抛开这种政治教育，孤立地同时又马虎从事地去搞生产竞赛。
    在过去一个时期中，工人的抗美爱国运动已有很大的规模。五个多月以来，各地工人参加抗美援朝集会和游行的已在一百六十四万人以上，参加爱国生产竞赛的在一百六十六万人以上。由于工人群众爱国认识的提高，许多地方的厂矿企业出现了生产新纪录，提高了产品质量，节约了原料，减低了成本，因而大大增加了国家的经济力量。
    但是，有不少的地方和不少的干部，直到现在还不了解抗美援朝运动的伟大历史意义，以为一个“突击运动”过去就算完成了任务，至少是“已经差不多”了，因而就自满起来，就不认真地坚持地深入地进行系统的抗美援朝的爱国教育。不仅北京的一部企业中存在着这种现象，在其他地方的一部分企业中也存在着同样的现象。例如，据新华社的材料，中南区的许多工会组织和企业单位的中共支部，还不认识抗美援朝爱国教育的重要意义，有的地方工会组织甚至有些省的工会组织，直到现在还没有重视这个工作。在不少企业中，由于爱国主义的时事政治教育没有认真进行，爱国生产竞赛或者根本没有发动起来，或者是仅仅在形式上发动了，但事实上，并未成为工人群众的自觉的爱国行动，有些工人甚至认为“竞赛还不是给厂方和资方多干活”。在这种情况下，爱国生产竞赛当然不会得到什么效果的。
    我们希望各地领导机关和各级工会组织，都要认真重视并加强对工人群众进行抗美援朝的宣传教育工作；各级工会都要在最近时间内，订出普及深入抗美援朝宣传教育的经常计划，并协助共产党把工厂企业中的宣传网建立起来，使时事政治宣传教育工作持久、经常地进行下去，使它成为推动我国工业生产前进的经常起作用的动力。
