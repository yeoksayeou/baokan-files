　　The Absurd and Outrageous US Draft Treaty with Japan

　　The US-drafted peace treaty with Japan, which it attempts to force upon other nations, has been published.

　　Although US officials have stated that this draft is merely a suggestion and is subject to discussion and modification, the principles of US policy toward Japan remain unchanged regardless of any revisions. Despite Dulles's efforts to cater to America's vassal states and especially to deceive and appease the Japanese people when drafting this treaty, no amount of linguistic trickery or obfuscation can conceal the US imperialist plot to dominate Japan, arm it, and prepare for new wars.

　　First, the US draft treaty with Japan is completely illegal, an utterly lawless separate peace proposal.

　　The Declaration by United Nations of January 1, 1942, stated: "Each Government undertakes to cooperate with the Governments signatory hereto and not to make a separate armistice or peace with the enemies." President Roosevelt, on behalf of the US government, solemnly signed this declaration.

　　Consider now Article XVIII of Chapter VIII of the US draft treaty with Japan, which states in its final clause: "For the purposes of the present Treaty, the Allied Powers shall be the States at war with Japan, or which have at any time been at war with Japan, and which become parties to the present Treaty." According to this, China, despite having fought against Japan, is not considered an "Allied Power" if it does not sign this treaty; and if it is not an "Allied Power," it cannot intervene in the affairs of the defeated nation of Japan, possessing "no right, legal basis, or interest whatsoever." The United States thus brazenly writes clauses into its draft treaty, coercing other nations to accept it, and using it to intimidate "Japan and the majority of members of the Far Eastern Commission" into signing. If the number of signatory nations does not constitute a "majority" of the members of the Far Eastern Commission, then the treaty will still be valid "nine months" after its ratification by Japan, even if only a "minority" of nations choose to sign it. And if even a minority of nations cannot be found, then "the United States, as the principal occupying power," will not hesitate to act alone, meaning: the US alone will conclude a separate peace with Japan, and it will still be valid.

　　This US draft treaty intentionally excludes China and the Soviet Union, the two major nations that fought against Japan, and it also holds America's vassal states in great contempt, subtly suggesting in its wording: if you do not comply with the will of the United States, then to hell with you!

　　Never before has a nation so brazenly dared to erase the contributions and will of all the nations that fought together, and to conclude a separate, even solitary, peace. This not only violates the legally binding force of the aforementioned Declaration by United Nations but also completely undermines the foundations of international morality through its unilateral actions and disregard for law.

　　Second, the main purpose of the US separate peace with Japan is to prepare for a new war. It is not a peace treaty, but a war treaty.

　　According to international documents such as the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy toward Japan, Japan must abolish its armed forces. This was one of the main objectives of the Allied Powers in fighting against Japan. However, this US draft treaty with Japan not only makes no mention of abolishing Japanese armed forces but also tries every possible way to legalize Japan's rearmament.

　　Examine Chapter IV of the draft carefully. Dulles focuses exclusively on the topic of "security," avoiding the word "armament," but in such a way as to allow Japan to arm itself to the teeth without restriction. The United States says that since Japan has sovereignty, it has the right to self-defense, which gives rise to the ability to establish military forces to defend that sovereignty. The US, fearing that Australia, New Zealand, and others might feel uneasy, politely explains in a footnote that Japanese armament must not "become a threat of aggression" and cannot be used "otherwise than for purposes which are consistent with the Principles and Purposes of the United Nations Charter to promote peace and security." This footnote is merely meant to deceive certain "Allied Powers," but it cannot deceive anyone in reality.

　　The United States uses two methods to completely control Japan's armament. First, through the UN organizations controlled by the United States. According to Article VI of Chapter IV of the draft, "Japan will undertake the obligations set forth in Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations." Therefore, on the day the treaty comes into effect, Japan will be obligated to obey the decisions of the "United Nations." For example, if the US's "United Nations" invades Korea, Japan must "give the United Nations every assistance," without any violation. Second, Article VII of the draft stipulates: "Japan recognizes the right of individual or collective self-defense and may enter voluntarily into collective security arrangements with one or more other States Members of the United Nations." This provision is perfectly clear. The so-called "one Allied Power" is the "US-Japan alliance," and the so-called "several Allied Powers" is the "Pacific Pact." According to reports, both of these pacts are being drafted by the US State Department. The former is called the "US-Japan Bilateral Agreement," which, according to Truman's statement on April 18, will stipulate that "the United States will maintain armed forces in and around Japan." The latter is a Pacific Pact similar to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and it is said that the participating countries include the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Japan. The United States has already begun to arm Japan and is already using Japan on a large scale as a tool for aggression against Korea. The US draft treaty with Japan calls for the full-scale armament of Japan and the formation of a Pacific aggression bloc centered on a rearmed Japan, to continue aggression against Korea and Taiwan of China, and to further threaten all peace-loving people in Asia.

　　To enable the unrestricted expansion of Japanese armament, to use this armed force to continue the war of aggression against Korea, and to prepare for a larger war of aggression against the people of Asia – this is the main purpose of the US separate peace with Japan.

　　Third, the US draft treaty with Japan infringes on China's sovereignty and interests, and also harms the Soviet Union. In the draft treaty, the United States does not treat China and the Soviet Union as victorious Allied Powers, but as enemy nations.

　　The Cairo Declaration decided that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands would be returned to China. This sacred provision is stealthily altered in Article III of Chapter III of the draft. It only mentions "Japan renounces all right, title and claim to Korea, Formosa and the Pescadores," without affirming to whom these territories would belong after the renunciation, implying the US's ambition to covet our country's territory. The US's armed occupation of Taiwan further confirms the US's territorial ambitions. Although Article V of the draft affirms that "Japan renounces all right, title and claim to that portion of Sakhalin and the islands adjacent to it over which the Soviet Union exercises sovereignty, and Japan renounces all right, title and claim to the Kurile Islands," Article XIX stipulates: "This Treaty shall not confer any rights, titles or benefits on any State which is not a party to this Treaty." That is to say, if the Soviet Union does not obey the US's command to sign this treaty, Japan can send troops to reclaim the southern part of Sakhalin and the Kurile Islands. The US government is not satisfied with using Japan to invade Korea and Taiwan. It is also preparing to drag Japan into a larger, more adventurous war. The danger of its intentions is evident here.

　　On the other hand, both the Atlantic Charter of August 1941 between Roosevelt and Churchill (endorsed by the Declaration by United Nations of 1942, making it legally binding) and the Cairo Declaration solemnly declared that the Allied Powers had no intention of territorial expansion. The United States has gone back on its word, showing insatiable greed. In addition to already acquiring the "former Japanese-mandated Pacific islands," it wants to use various means to seize the Ryukyu Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, and other Japanese islands. This is clearly an arrangement for invading the Asian continent and controlling Japan's fate.

　　Article XI: "Japan renounces all special rights and interests in China." What special rights will Japan renounce in China? Things like concessions and consular jurisdiction. This is something that a defeated nation that once had special rights in China must do, and it certainly should not retain its privileges in China. But this does not mean that this draft treaty takes care of China's interests. On the contrary, in Chapter VI, "Claims and Property," it not only closes the door to China's reasonable demands on Japan but also paves the way for Japan to make a series of demands on China under various pretexts. Article XIV of the draft declares that Japan is unable to pay reparations. "Allied Powers' claims for reparations" can only be paid in two ways: one is through "Japanese assets" within each country's jurisdiction. In other words, Japanese property in China is not "abandoned" but used as compensation. The other is "resources already obtained from the Japanese mainland during the occupation period," which refers to the more than 9,000 pieces of broken-down machinery obtained by the Kuomintang reactionary government. According to this draft, when the treaty is signed, China cannot make any demands on Japan. On the contrary, Japan can demand that China return "material assets of diplomatic and consular agencies" and previously aggressive enterprises, including "material assets of religious, charitable, cultural or educational institutions." This is what they mean by "Japan renouncing all special rights and interests in China."

　　Fourth, for Japan, this treaty is a contract of national subjugation and racial extinction. The United States is layering restrictions and exploitation upon Japan both militarily and economically, and the Japanese nation will never have a chance to recover.

　　Dulles is making every effort to promote that he is "fighting for a lenient peace treaty with Japan."

　　Just how lenient is it? At first glance, after the treaty is signed, Japan regains its sovereignty, can freely arm itself, no longer has to pay reparations, and enjoys equal and most-favored-nation treatment or national treatment with the United States, which seems quite lenient. But upon closer inspection, all the so-called leniency is a deception, and each "leniency" can send Japan to hell.

　　First, let's talk about the lenient sovereignty. Article II of the draft states that "The Allied Powers recognize the full sovereignty of the Japanese people over Japan and its territorial waters." This is completely an empty phrase. First of all, this Japanese sovereignty cannot protect its territory, territorial waters, and airspace. The US Army will continue to be stationed on Japanese territory; US air bases in Japan are like honeycombs; and the US Navy can freely enter and exit Japanese military ports and territorial waters. This Japanese sovereignty cannot protect its industries and businesses because it must give the United States most-favored-nation treatment or national treatment, which means that the United States has monopolistic designs. Japan cannot implement protective tariffs and cannot prevent American capital from controlling and even stifling Japan's economic life because it must also obey the decisions of the so-called United Nations, which means that Japan cannot freely trade with Asian countries in a way that is conducive to developing peaceful industries. The treaty grants Japan a sovereignty that has neither "sovereignty" nor "rights." As such, Japan's status after the signing of this treaty will be equivalent to the most humble colony of the United States. This is one of the "leniencies" of the United States.

　　This draft treaty does not say a word about democratizing Japanese politics and guaranteeing the peaceful life of the Japanese people. The United States is not interested in these things. Its interest lies in depriving the Japanese people of their basic human rights and reviving fascist militarism and releasing Japanese war criminals. According to the implication of Article XII of the draft, war criminals who have already been illegally released cannot be held accountable; war criminals who have not been indicted or tried cannot be arrested or extradited. The only remaining war criminal issue is listening to the United States' instructions and granting sentence reductions and amnesty to war criminals in prison. Being especially gracious to war criminals and extremely cruel to the Japanese people is the second "leniency" of the United States.

　　On the issue of security, the United States seems to be very warmly considering protecting Japan. The American God said, "Someone wants to invade you, so I must protect you." Who exactly is invading Japan? The one invading Japan is none other than US imperialism, which is "protecting" Japan. In fact, the first issue to be resolved for Japan's "security" is nothing else but the Japanese people must adhere to the national independence movement and drive out the American aggressors. The hateful American aggressors also want to use the invaded Japan as a tool for aggression in Asia. Japanese fascists, caught between being invaded and invading, are enthusiastically dreaming of becoming slaves and ascending to heaven. The treaty allows Japan to rearm. For whom is it rearming? It is very clear that it is arming for the United States, to be cannon fodder for American imperialism. As a result, it will inevitably set fire to itself and make Japanese territory a battlefield. This is the third "leniency" of the United States.

　　Japan does not have to pay reparations anymore, and the United States can also refrain from demanding repayment of occupation expenses. The United States seems generous in this regard. Does the United States really not want money? Nonsense! The United States has already earned enough money in Japan and wants to continue to earn without restrictions. The "post-war settlement expenses" paid by Japan for serving the US occupying forces have already extracted a large amount of blood and sweat from the Japanese people. The US government has controlled most of Japan's industry through various forms, such as counterpart funds from US aid. American capitalists have used the decree to dissolve Japanese financial cliques to cheaply acquire Japanese stocks. Japanese industry has become or is becoming American industry. The forty American trading companies and twelve shipping companies in Japan completely monopolize Japan's trade, extracting profits more than ten times higher than the cost at unequal exchange rates. After more than five years of plunder, almost all of Japan's property has been transferred to the United States. The entire Japanese property has been given to the United States. Why would it need any compensation or occupation expenses? The Philippines insisted on demanding reparations, and the United States believed that Japan's reparations had "infringed" on its vested interests, so it frankly replied: "The United States cannot see its own property being taken away as reparations." It can be seen from this that the US's cancellation of reparations means that it has monopolized the reparations, seized Japanese property, and developed war industries in Japan.

　　The United States not only wants to seize Japan's present but also wants to seize Japan's future. According to the provisions of Chapter V of the draft, Japan must sign a commercial treaty with the United States to protect the United States' vested privileges and interests. Within three years after the treaty takes effect, the United States can continue to enjoy all rights and interests in Japan until the commercial treaty is signed. Everything the United States wants is the most-favored-nation treatment or national treatment with the essence of US monopoly. This is the fourth "leniency" of the United States.

　　There are too many of such "leniencies" from the United States to list. In short, everything the United States has already occupied is the United States'; everything in Japan and other Allied countries that has not yet been occupied by the United States also must be the United States'. Once the treaty is signed, Japan will only have a geographical name left, and a group of slaves struggling for survival on the brink of death while wearing shackles.

　　Fifth, this US draft treaty not only threatens the security of all countries in the Far East and the Pacific but also undermines the natural relations of Asian economies.

　　Article XIII of the draft stipulates: "If any State requires Japan to grant it any preference higher than that granted by that State to Japan, other than any reservations in its commercial treaty, Japan may refuse to do so." According to this provision, to give an example, US citizens enjoy the same treatment as Japanese citizens when operating factories in Japan, and Japanese citizens enjoy the same treatment as US citizens when operating factories in the United States. It is said that this is equal reciprocity. The United States can agree to this because it is not afraid of Japanese citizens competing with American capitalists in the United States. Can India agree to this? Can Australia, Indonesia, or the Philippines agree to this? If they cannot agree, then they cannot obtain the treatment enjoyed by the United States in Japan. In this way, the Japanese economy will be incorporated into the US system, and the natural relations of Asian economies will be undermined. Through its manipulation of Japan, American capitalists will more easily erode Asia's economic interests. American cotton can defeat Indian cotton, Osaka textiles can defeat Manchester textiles, Japanese ships can defeat British ships, and so on.

　　A US draft treaty with Japan like this is absurd and outrageous, unprecedented in history. It completely violates the principle of a joint peace treaty with Japan by the Allied Powers, violates the purpose of the Allied Powers' war against Japan, completely destroys all international agreements with Japan, harms the legitimate interests of other Allied countries, and destroys the promises given to Japan by the Potsdam Declaration. The draft is a challenge to the people of China, the people of the Soviet Union, the people of Japan, the people of Asia, and all peace-loving people in the world.

　　The People's Republic of China has long declared that China is willing to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible with other Allied countries in the Second World War, based on the international agreements of the Allied Powers' policies towards Japan, to end the state of war with Japan, and to enable the Japanese people to obtain democracy, peace, and national independence. Without the participation and consent of the People's Republic of China, any treaty signed with Japan by the United States or the United States and its so-called allies is illegal and invalid. The Chinese people have resisted Japan for the longest time and have made the greatest sacrifices. The great contribution to defeating Japanese imperialism is indelible, and the right to speak on the peace treaty with Japan is unshakable. The Chinese people are the most determined in opposing the revival of Japanese imperialism and are also the most sympathetic to the Japanese people's liberation movement. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the US's separate peace plan, which enslaves the Japanese nation and harms the people of all ethnic groups in the Far East.

　　The Japanese people should oppose this treaty even more. The Potsdam Declaration states, "We do not intend to enslave the Japanese people or destroy them as a nation." This treaty seeks to enslave the Japanese people and destroy the Japanese nation. The Potsdam Declaration demands that Japan's politics be democratic and peace-oriented; it allows Japan to obtain raw materials, develop peaceful industries, and maintain and improve the people's lives. This treaty only seeks to wage war, disregards the life and death of the Japanese people, and completely deprives the Japanese people of their material and spiritual rights to survival. The Japanese people must oppose a separate peace and rearmament and carry out the struggle for national independence and liberation.

　　The people of various countries in the Far East cannot sit idly by while Japanese militarism is revived. They cannot allow the United States to take credit for the work of others, monopolize the Japanese peace treaty, and harm the people of Asia. The people of Asia must unite and drive out US imperialism!

　　The Chinese people are determined to fight alongside the Japanese people and the people of all ethnic groups in the East to bury this absurd and outrageous draft treaty in the flames of the great national independence and liberation movement of the Asian people.

### 荒谬绝伦的美国对日和约草案

　　荒谬绝伦的美国对日和约草案
    美国单独起草并企图强迫他国接受的对日和约草案发表了。
    虽然美官方曾声明该草案仅是一种建议，尚待讨论修改；但无论怎样修改，美国对日政策的各项原则是不变的，万变不离其宗的。虽然杜勒斯起草这个草案时，确曾挖空心思，极力敷衍美国的仆从国家，特别希望以之欺骗、讨好日本人；但无论怎样应用文字技巧，故弄玄虚使意义含糊，都不能够掩饰美帝国主义独霸日本、武装日本与准备新战争的阴谋。
    第一、美国对日和约草案完全是非法的，它是一个无法无天的单独媾和方案。
    一九四二年元旦反法西斯的同盟国宣言：“每一政府，承允与本宣言签字国政府合作，并不与敌国缔结单独停战协定或和约。”在这宣言上，美国罗斯福总统曾代表美国政府庄重地签了字。
    请看现在美国的对日和约草案第八章第十八条最后条款：“为本条约之目的，所称盟国系指曾与日本作战或曾与日本处于交战状态，并为本条约缔约国之国家。”依此，中国虽与日本作战，不在这个和约签字，便不是它所称的“盟国”；不是“盟国”，对战败国日本便不能过问，即没有“任何权利、法律基础或利益”。美国这样横暴地写下强迫他国接受它的对日和约的条文，用以威吓“日本及远东委员会大多数会员国”参加签字。如签字国不够远东委员会会员国的“大多数”，则和约在日本批准后“九个月”，“少数”国家自行决定签字也有效。假使连少数国家都没有，“作为主要占领国的美国”就不客气地要唱独脚戏了，就是说：我美国一国与日本单独媾和，仍然有效。
    美国这和约草案，蓄意排斥中苏两大对日作战国家的参加，而且十分看不起美国的那些仆从国，字里行间隐约地对它们说：若不顺从美国的意旨就去你的吧！
    有史以来，没有一个国家像美国这样肆无忌惮、敢于磨灭所有共同作战国家的功劳与意志，而单独甚至孤独的媾和。这不但违背上述同盟国宣言法律的拘束，实际是一手遮天，目无法纪，彻底破坏了国际道义的基础。
    第二、美国对日单独媾和的主要目的，是为了准备新战争。那不是什么和平条约，而是战争条约。
    根据波茨坦公告、远东委员会对日基本政策等国际文件，日本必须废除武装。这是盟国对日作战的主要目的之一。但美国这个对日和约草案，不仅对废除日本武装一字不提，而且千方百计使日本再武装合法化。
    请仔细研究草案第四章。杜勒斯专在“安全”的题目上做文章，不碰武装字样，但却做到可以使日本武装到牙齿而不受限制。美国说日本既有主权，即有自卫权，因而产生可以建立保卫主权的武力。美国恐怕澳大利亚、纽西兰等感觉不安，特别礼貌地在附注中说明日本武装不能“成为进攻的威胁”，不可以作为“非按联合国宗旨与原则促进和平与安全之用”。这注脚，无非为了哄骗某些“盟国”，其实是对谁都欺骗不了的。
    美国应用两个方法，完全掌握着日本武装。其一，通过美国所控制的联合国机构。根据草案第四章第六条“日本承担联合国宪章第二条所述的义务”，则和约签字生效之日，日本便开始有义务服从“联合国”的决定了。例如美国的“联合国”侵略朝鲜，日本就必须“尽力予以协助”，不得有违。其二，草案第七条规定：“承认日本可以自愿地参加集体安全的一个或几个协定，其中有一个或数个盟国参加者。”这规定明白不过，所谓“一个盟国”就是“美日同盟”，所谓“数个盟国”就是“太平洋公约”。据讯，这两个公约已在美国务院起草中。前者叫“美日双边协定”，根据杜鲁门四月十八日声明，这个协定将规定：“美国将在日本及日本周围驻扎武装部队”。后者即类似北大西洋公约的太平洋公约，据说参加国家有美国、澳大利亚、纽西兰、菲律宾、日本等。美国已开始武装了日本，并已大规模地利用日本为侵略朝鲜的工具；美国对日和约草案，则要求全面武装日本，并以再武装了的日本为中心，形成太平洋侵略集团，继续侵略朝鲜与中国台湾，并进而威胁全亚洲所有爱好和平的人民。
    使日本武装无限制扩大起来，利用这个武装力量，继续侵略朝鲜的战争，并准备更大的侵略亚洲人民的战争，这就是美国单独对日媾和的主要目的。
    第三、美国对日和约草案，在主权与权益上，既侵略中国，又损害了苏联。在和约草案中，美国不是以中苏为战胜的盟国，而是视为敌国。
    开罗宣言决定台湾及澎湖列岛归还中国，这神圣的规定，在草案第三章第三条里面被窃改了，它仅提起“日本放弃对朝鲜、台湾及澎湖列岛的一切权利、权利上的根据与要求”，而不肯定放弃后的归属问题，弦外之音，暗示美国觊觎我国领土的野心。美国的武装占领台湾更加证实了美国的领土野心。草案第五条虽然肯定“日本将库页岛的南部及其附近的一切岛屿归还苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟，并将千岛群岛移交苏联”；但在第十九条中又规定：“对任何未经签字，批准或加入本条约之国家，本条约将不给予任何权利、法律基础或利益”。就是说，苏联如不听美国之命在本约签字，日本可以兴兵收回库页岛南部和千岛群岛。美国政府并不以利用日本侵略朝鲜和台湾为满足，它还准备把日本拖进更大的冒险的战争，其用心之险，于此可见。
    另方面，不论一九四一年八月罗斯福邱吉尔大西洋宣言（一九四二年同盟国宣言予以赞成，有法律的拘束力）或开罗宣言都信誓旦旦，同盟国无意扩张领土。美国竟食言而肥，贪欲无餍，除已经取得“前日本委任统治地太平洋岛屿”外，还要玩弄各种手段，攫取琉球、小笠原及其他日本的群岛。很显然的，这是侵略亚洲大陆，并制日本之死命的布置。
    第十一条“日本放弃在中国的一切特别权利和利益”。日本在中国将放弃什么特权呢？放弃租界、领事裁判权之类。这本是过去在中国有特权的一个战败国所绝对必须做的，难道日本还应该保持它在中国的特权吗？但这并不表示这个草案照顾中国的利益，相反，在草案第六章“要求及财产”里面，不仅关闭了中国对日本的合理要求之门，而且为日本开辟道路，使它有权可以假借各种名义向中国提出一系列的要求。草案第十四条宣布日本本国无力支付赔偿，“盟国的赔偿要求”只能有两种支付办法：一种是各该国管辖范围内的“日本资产”。换言之，日本在华财产并不是“放弃”，而是作为赔偿了事的。另一种就是“占领期内自日本本土所已取得的资财”，这就是国民党反动政府所取得的九千余件破烂机器。照此草案，和约签字时，中国不能对日本有所要求，相反的，日本可以要求中国交还“外交及领事机关的物质资产”，可以要求交还以前侵略性的事业包括“宗教、慈善、文化或教育机关的物质资产”等。这就是“日本放弃在中国的一切特别权利和利益”。
    第四、对日本来说，这和约是亡国灭种的卖身契。美国从军事又从经济对日本层层束缚与盘剥，日本民族永远休想翻身。
    杜勒斯竭力宣传他在“为签订宽大对日和约而斗争”。
    究竟怎样个宽大呢？乍一看，和约签订，日本恢复了主权，可以自由武装，不必再付赔偿，与美国平等、互相享有最惠国待遇或国民待遇，好像是够宽大的。详细研究一番，所有所谓宽大都是骗局，每个“宽大”都可以把日本打进地狱。
    先说宽大的主权。草案第二草“盟国承认日本人民对日本及其领海有充分的主权”。这完全是一句空话。首先，这日本主权就不能保护它的领土、领海和领空。在日本的领土上，美国陆军将继续驻扎；美国在日本的空军基地像蜂窝一样；美国海军可以自由出入日本的军港和领海。这日本主权，又不能保护它的工商业，因为必须给美国以美国独占为内容的最惠国待遇，或国民待遇，日本便不能实行保护关税，便无法阻止美国资本操纵以至窒息日本的经济生活；因为还要服从美国的所谓联合国的决定，日本便不能自由与亚洲国家进行符合于发展和平工业的贸易。和约是给日本这样一个既无“主”又无“权”的主权的，依此看来，此和约签字后的日本地位将等于美国的最卑贱的殖民地。这是美国的“宽大”之一。
    关于日本政治应民主化，和保障日本人民的和平生活问题，这个和约草案绝口不谈。美国对这些不感兴趣，它的兴趣在于剥夺日本人民的基本人权，复兴法西斯军国主义，和释放日本战犯。照草案第十二条的涵义，已经非法释放的战犯，不能追究；未经起诉与审判的战犯，不能逮捕、移交；今后战犯问题只剩听美国吩咐，对在狱战犯给予减刑特赦而已。对战犯格外开恩，对日本人民极端残酷，这是美国“宽大”之二。
    在安全问题上，美国好像很温存地在为保护日本着想。美国上帝说：“人家要侵略你呀，非我保护不可呀。”到底是谁在侵略日本呢？侵略日本的不是别人，正是在“保护”着日本的美国帝国主义。事实上解决日本“安全”的头一个问题，不是别的，正是日本人民必须坚持民族独立运动，赶走美国侵略者。可恶的美国侵略者还要利用被侵略的日本做侵略亚洲的工具。日本法西斯分子，在被侵略与侵略之间，起劲地在做奴才进天国的美梦。和约允许日本再武装，为谁武装呢？很明白的，为美国，替美国帝国主义当炮灰。而其结果，必然引火烧身，使日本国土沦为战场。这是美国的“宽大”之三。
    日本不必再支付赔偿，美国占领费也可以不要求偿还。美国此举好像够慷慨。难道美国真的不要钱吗？见鬼！美国在日本已赚够了钱，还要无限制地包赚下去。日本为美国占领军服务所付出的“终战处理费”，已榨取了日本人民一大笔血汗。美国政府通过各种形式，例如美援对等资金等，已控制了日本产业的大部分。美国资本家利用解散日本财阀的法令，廉价收买日本的股票，日本产业已变成或正在变成美国的产业。美国在日本的四十家贸易公司、十二家轮船公司，完全垄断日本的贸易，以不等价的汇率，榨取高于成本十倍以上的高额利润。经过这五年多来的掠夺，可怜日本产业已差不多全部转入美国手中。整个日本财产都送给美国了，还要什么赔偿，要什么占领费？菲律宾坚持赔偿的要求，美国认为日本赔偿已“侵犯”到它的既得权益，曾坦白答复：“美国不能看见自己的财产，被人当做赔款拿去。”由此可见，美国取消赔偿，就是它独占了赔偿，霸占了日本财产，在日本发展战争工业。
    美国不但霸占日本的现在，还要霸占日本的将来。根据草案第五章规定，日本必须与美国签订商约，保护美国既得的特权与利益。在和约生效后三年内，美国可以在日本继续享受一切权益，到商约签订为止。美国一切都要以美国独占为实质的最惠国待遇或国民待遇，这是美国的“宽大”之四。
    美国如此一类的“宽大”，不胜枚举。总之，所有美国已经占有的东西，都是美国的；所有还未被美国占有的日本的和其他盟国的东西，也都要是美国的。一旦和约签字，日本将只剩下一个地理名词，和一群套着锁链在死亡线上挣扎的奴隶。
    第五、美国这个和约草案，不仅威胁着所有远东和太平洋国家的安全，而且还要破坏亚洲经济的自然关系。
    草案第十三条规定：“任何一国要求日本给予优待，比较该国除其商约照例保留者外，所给予日本之优待为较高者，则日本得以拒绝之。”依此规定，举一个例，美国国民在日本办工厂享有日本国民的待遇，日本国民在美国办工厂也享有美国国民的待遇。据说这是平等互惠。美国可以答应，因为它不怕日本国民到美国和美国的资本家竞争。印度能答应吗？澳洲、印尼、菲律宾能答应吗？不能答应则在日本不能获得美国所享有的待遇。这样，就将日本经济纳入美国体系之中，破坏亚洲经济的自然关系。通过对日本的操纵，美国资本家将更顺利地蚕食亚洲的经济利益。美国棉花可以打倒印度棉花，大阪的纺织品可以打倒曼彻斯特的纺织品，日本轮船可以打倒英国轮船，诸如此类。
    像美国这样的对日和约草案，是荒谬绝伦、史无前例的。它完全违反盟国对日共同媾和的原则，违反盟国对日作战的目的，彻底破坏一切对日国际协议，损害其他盟国的合法利益，摧毁波茨坦公告给予日本的诺言。草案是对中国人民、苏联人民、日本人民、亚洲人民和全世界一切爱好和平人民的一份挑战书。
    中华人民共和国早就宣布，中国愿意尽速与第二次大战中其他盟国在盟国对日政策的国际协议的基础上，缔结全面的对日和约，结束对日战争状态，使日本人民得到民主、和平与国家的独立。没有中华人民共和国的参加与同意，不管美国或美国及其所谓盟国与日本签订任何和约，都是非法的，无效的。中国人民抗日最久，牺牲最大，对于击败日本帝国主义的伟大贡献是不可磨灭的，对于对日和约的发言权是不可动摇的。中国人民反对日本帝国的复活最坚决，对于日本人民的解放运动也最同情，中国人民坚决反对美国这个奴役日本民族和危害远东各族人民的单独媾和方案。
    日本人民更应该反对这个和约。波茨坦公告写着“吾人无意奴役日本民族或灭亡其国家。”这个和约是要奴役日本民族和灭亡日本国家的。波茨坦公告要求日本政治民主，及倾向和平；允许日本取得原料，发展和平工业，维持和改善人民的生活。这个和约只图遂行战争，不顾日本人民的死活，完全剥夺日本人民物质的和精神的生存权利。日本人民必须反对单独媾和及反对重新武装，进行民族独立解放斗争。
    远东各国人民不能坐视日本军国主义的复活，不能允许美国贪天之功，包办日本和约，危害亚洲人民。亚洲人民要团结起来，赶走美帝国主义！
    中国人民决心与日本人民及东方各族人民共同奋斗，把这个荒谬绝伦的和约草案，埋葬在亚洲人民伟大的民族独立解放运动的怒火中。
