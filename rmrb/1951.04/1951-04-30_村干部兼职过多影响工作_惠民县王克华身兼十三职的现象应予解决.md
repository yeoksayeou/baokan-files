　　Too Many Concurrent Positions Held by Village Cadres Affect Work
    The Phenomenon of Wang Kehua in Huimin County Holding Thirteen Positions Should Be Resolved

To the Editors:

    I am Wang Kehua from Wangjiadianzi Village, Jinjia Township, Fifth District, Huimin County, Shandong Province. I am twenty years old this year. I am an alternate member of the Chinese Communist Party and also a member of the Communist Youth League. I know that a Communist Party member should serve the people wholeheartedly. However, because I currently hold too many concurrent positions, although I am busy all day long, I still cannot do my job well.

    My current positions include: Standing Committee Member of the Youth Circle of the Huimin County People's Representative Conference, Member of the District Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, Secretary of the Township General Branch, Secretary of the Village Branch, Group Leader, Public Security Officer of Jinjia Township, Militia Instructor, Acting Secretary of the Party Branch of this Village (alternate party members cannot serve as branch secretary), Director of the Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families Committee, Director of the Culture and Education Committee, Director of the Winter Study Committee, Winter Study Teacher, and Noon Study Teacher. Because I hold too many concurrent positions, meetings take up most of my time every day. During the busy farming season in summer, I attended twenty-eight meetings in one month. In winter, I attended more than forty meetings in one month. As a result, my work has not been done well, but I am already dizzy and have developed a brain ailment. My family also has a lot of complaints about me because I am busy with meetings all day long, which delays production.

    When the rectification movement began last year, I was studying in the county. I raised the issue and asked the leading comrades to find a way to solve my problem of holding too many concurrent positions. As a result, the comrades only asked me to examine my mistakes and shortcomings in my work, and did not allow me to raise difficult issues; therefore, it was not resolved.

    I once wrote a letter to the Shandong Rural Mass Newspaper about this situation. My letter was published on the Rural Garden page of the fourth edition of the 94th issue of the Rural Mass Newspaper. However, the leading comrades of the Fifth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party not only did not help solve my problem of holding too many concurrent positions, but instead seized on individual words and phrases in my letter to argue with me. I believe that if this continues, my work will not be done well. I hope you can help me solve this problem.

          Wang Kehua

    Editor's Note: We believe that Comrade Wang Kehua's request is correct. Holding too many concurrent positions will inevitably affect work and production. The county and district leaders of Huimin County should consider and appropriately solve his problem. In order to solve the phenomenon of village cadres holding too many concurrent positions, county and district leading cadres are required to go deep into the masses, boldly cultivate and promote cadres. In order to solve the phenomenon of too many meetings, this requires county and district leaders to minimize unnecessary and unprepared meetings for village cadres; at the same time, for meetings that must be held, they should also seize the time to avoid delaying work and production. In short, the leadership must be good at following the mass line and deeply leading the work in order to solve various specific problems and difficulties at the grassroots level.

　　村干部兼职过多影响工作
    惠民县王克华身兼十三职的现象应予解决编辑同志：
    我是山东省惠民县五区金家乡王家店子村人，今年二十岁。我是中国共产党候补党员，也是青年团员。我知道一个共产党员应该全心全意为人民服务。但因为我现在兼职太多，虽然终日忙碌，仍不能把工作作好。
    我现任的职务有：惠民县各界人民代表会议青年界常务委员，中国新民主主义青年团区委委员、乡总支部书记、村支部书记、小组长，金家乡公安员、民兵指导员，本村中共党支部代理书记（候补党员不能任支部书记）、拥军优属委员会主任、文教委员会主任、冬学委员会主任，冬学教师、午学教师。因为我兼职太多，所以每天开会占去大部时间。夏季农忙时，一个月中我参加了二十八次会议。冬季时，一个月就参加了四十多次会议。这样，我的工作没有做好，但已累得头昏眼花，并且得了脑病。我家里也因我整天忙着开会，耽误生产，对我很有意见。
    去年整风运动开始时，我正在县里学习。我提出意见，请领导同志设法解决我兼职太多的问题。结果同志们只让我检讨自己在工作中的错误和缺点，不让我提困难问题；所以没有得到解决。
    我曾经把这一情况写信告知山东农村大众报。农村大众报第九十四期第四版农村园地上发表了我的信。可是中共第五区区委会领导同志不但不帮助解决我兼职太多的问题，反而抓住我信中的个别辞句，与我争执。我认为：这样下去，我的工作是做不好的，希望你们帮助我解决这一问题。
          王克华    编者按：我们认为王克华同志的要求是正确的，兼职过多，势必影响工作和生产。惠民县县区领导上应该考虑并适当解决他的问题。为要解决村干部兼职过多的现象，就要求县区领导干部能够深入群众，大胆放手培养与提拔干部。为解决会议过多的现象，这就要求县区领导上尽量减少不必要的和没有准备的村干部会议；同时，对必须召开的会议，也要抓紧时间，以免耽误工作和生产。总之，领导上必须善于走群众路线，深入领导工作，才能解决下面的各种具体问题和困难。
