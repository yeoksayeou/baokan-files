Yunnan Zhaotong Christian and Catholic Communities
Hold Anti-Imperialist Patriotic Congress
Telegraph Chairman Mao to Support Resistance Against America
[This newspaper dispatch] Yunnan Zhaotong Christian and Catholic figures recently held an anti-American, aid-Korea, protect-the-homeland, and anti-imperialist patriotic congress. They sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, expressing their commitment to earnestly implement the Three-Self Patriotic Movement and support the struggle to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose imperialism and feudalism. The original telegram is as follows:

Dear Chairman Mao:

We thank you. Because of your wise leadership, our people, who have been oppressed for thousands of years, have stood up, and our nation, which has been bullied, has raised its head. Today, even we, the Christian and Catholic believers in remote and isolated Zhaotong, who have been cruelly anesthetized and enslaved for nearly a century by imperialism, especially American imperialism, under the guise of religion, have also recognized our friends and enemies, and recognized the evil intentions of imperialism thanks to your teachings. We are loyal believers and, even more so, Chinese people. Under your leadership, we will earnestly implement the Three-Self Movement to realize a pure Chinese people's own church that loves the motherland, loves service, and loves peace; do our jobs well to support the revolutionary struggle to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose imperialism and feudalism. We will forever follow you, and respectfully wish you good health.

Zhaotong Christian and Catholic Anti-American, Aid-Korea, Protect-the-Homeland, Anti-Imperialist Patriotic Congress, April 4th
