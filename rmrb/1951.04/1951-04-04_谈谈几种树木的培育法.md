To the Editors:

I am sending this material because since last autumn, many labor models from various provinces and regions have written to me, requesting information on how to plant and care for various trees. I have only written down some methods of tree care for now.

Spring has arrived, and it is time to do this work. I hope you will review this material and publish it so that the broad masses can use it. This is only a preliminary draft and there will certainly be shortcomings. At the same time, this material is based on the situation in my area, and there may be variations in other regions due to different climates. I hope that experts in various places will offer criticisms and suggestions after reading it.

Persimmon Tree Method for Inserting Shoots After the Awakening of Insects (Jingzhe): When the wild jujube tree is thick enough, you can use shoot grafting (cleft grafting). First, split the mother tree (rootstock) with an axe, and use a sharp knife to cut the persimmon scion (graft) into a triangular shape. After inserting it properly (the cambium of the scion and the cambium of the rootstock should be tightly connected), no need to wrap anything, it is also very firm. Then cover it with mud. If it is high above the ground, use two sticks to tie below the mud head, and then use other things to pad around it and cover it with soil. This method ensures survival. It is best to use a paste made of yellow wax, alfalfa, and pig tallow to seal the shoot graft, which can protect it from wind and sun. If you don't have these things, just use mud.

There is also another grafting method for wild jujube trees: When the persimmon flowers bloom, use bud grafting (T-budding). The back of the bud should have a half-grain of rice shape to ensure survival. You can also use patch budding. First, cut the bark of the wild jujube tree into a T-shape, then attach the prepared scion, and wrap it tightly with hemp. If there are gaps, it will not survive.

Pear Tree Grafting Method: Pear tree grafting also uses shoot grafting after the Awakening of Insects (Jingzhe). Split the rootstock with an axe, and cut the scion into two faces like knife edges, attach the bark to the outside, and cover it with mud.

There is also another pear tree grafting method: bud grafting (T-budding) after wheat harvest. Use new branches with leaves as scions, cut off the leaves, leaving the petioles. If the inside is convex when peeled open, it will survive, and if there are holes, it will not survive. In addition, pear trees can also be grafted by cuttings around the Beginning of Autumn (Liqiu), without cutting off the leaves.

Apricot trees are also grafted after the Awakening of Insects (Jingzhe): Grafting small apricots onto large apricots requires grafting every year. Use shoot grafting this year and bud grafting the following year. Grafting twice yields extra-large fruits, but once is also acceptable. The method is the same as above (persimmon, pear). After grafting apricot trees, you also have to watch out for insects (pay attention to insects four or five days after grafting), otherwise, the insects will damage the buds, and they may not survive. Peach trees can also be grafted onto apricot trees, and apricot trees can also be grafted onto peach trees. Red and yellow plum trees can also be grafted onto peach and apricot trees, and peach and apricot trees can also be grafted onto red and yellow plum trees. These four types of trees are all grafted by cuttings during the Awakening of Insects (Jingzhe), and bud grafting is done after the wheat harvest. The method is the same as for persimmon, pear trees, etc.

Wild pear, flowering crabapple, sour plum, and sand pear trees can all be grafted onto sweet crabapple trees, and also onto apple trees. Grafting apple trees twice yields extra-large fruits. The method is the same as for peach and apricot trees. Pear trees grown from pear seeds also need to be grafted, otherwise the pears will not be delicious. After the autumn harvest, open the wild pear fruit, dry it, and store it. Plant it in the spring, and it can be transplanted in the autumn harvest. Mulberry seeds emerge as soon as they are planted and must also be dried and rubbed open before planting. Rake the ground level, scatter the seeds on the ground, and rake them once with a bamboo rake. Elm and willow trees are planted in the spring (elm seed catkins, willow seed fluff. The seeds are small and should not be planted too deep.

Planting methods (Sowing methods): It is best to plant walnut trees with green skins during the White Dew (Bailu) season, and they will emerge this year. Planting dry walnuts after the autumn harvest will not emerge this year. Peach and apricot fruits cannot be planted this year when they are ripe. Plant them in winter, and they will emerge early the following spring. To cultivate pear trees, you need to plant wild pear seeds. After the autumn harvest, open the wild pear fruit, dry it, and store it. Plant it in the spring, and it can be transplanted in the autumn harvest. Mulberry seeds emerge as soon as they are planted and must also be dried and rubbed open before planting. Rake the ground level, scatter the seeds on the ground, and rake them once with a bamboo rake. Elm and willow trees are planted in the spring (elm seed catkins, willow seed fluff. The seeds are small and should not be planted too deep.

Planting methods: When planting small trees, first dig a hole. When planting, the trunk should be close to the edge. Bury it with soil, lift the tree upwards to spread the roots, then add soil and tamp it down. When planting large trees, cut off most of the top. Remember the yin and yang sides. The yin side is black, and the yang side is white. The yang side faces the sun, and the yin side faces the shade for easy survival. When planting large trees, you must cut off large branches for easy survival. Small trees should not be topped. One-year-old paulownia seedlings do not survive well when planted. You must cultivate two-year-old seedlings. Also, do not remove the green leaves, as removing the green leaves will cause sunburned bark. Generally, trees are planted in all four seasons. It is best to plant pepper trees in the dog days (Fu Tian). When planting cypress trees, first dig a hole, plant the tree in the hole, then water it, and shake the roots to stick to the mud. After the water seeps into the soil, cover it with soil and tamp it down. The best time to transplant trees is in autumn and winter. "Planting trees in spring makes the trees sick, and planting trees in winter makes the trees dream." It is best to plant grapes in rainy weather, and they must be pressed down when planted in spring. To get large fruits, you must graft. You can graft any tree, and relying solely on lateral branches will not produce large fruits. Wild jujube trees and jujube trees can be grafted onto any tree. Pepper trees must have the "hairy legs" (redundant branches) removed for a large harvest. Walnuts are harvested during the White Dew (Bailu) season. Do not harvest after these few days (for fear of damaging the bark, which will harm the growth). If the persimmon tree is damaged, sawing off half a stump can still produce new branches (referring to cutting a fork into five branches). After sawing, you must chop it with an axe, chop it into oblique stubs, which is good for the easy growth of new branches. Every household raising seedlings, the endless benefits are indescribable, and they can also harvest fruits even in slightly drier weather, because the roots of the fruit trees are deep and can absorb water.

Editor's Note: Comrade Shi Yudian is an agricultural labor model who attended the First National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers. He is from Dongye Village, Lin County, Pingyuan Province. He learned to graft trees at the age of fourteen and is fifty-nine years old this year. For more than forty years, he has grafted more than 20,000 fruit trees for villages near Dongye Village. He has also taught more than 150 people how to graft trees. In the long process of labor, he has accumulated rich experience in fruit tree cultivation and has also created many valuable fruit tree cultivation methods, such as the fruit tree branch drilling method, the apple tree bark cutting method, and the pepper tree pruning method, which can make fruitless fruit trees and fruit branches bear fruit. Because he actively helped villagers graft and plant trees, the area around Dongye Village in Lin County is densely covered with orchards that are connected from village to village, and farmers' incomes are increasing day by day. Today, we publish the article "Shi Yudian's Tree Cultivation Method" for research and learning in various places. The solar terms mentioned in the article are only applicable to North China. The northeast, northwest, and other colder regions will be later, and other warmer regions can be earlier. (Attached picture)

　　谈谈几种树木的培育法
    石玉殿口述  岳发儒记编辑同志：
    寄去这个材料，是有原因的，从去年秋后到现在，各省各地劳动模范们给我来信很多，都是要的各种树的种法、和养法。今仅写了一些养树的办法。
    春天已来到了，正是该做这一工作的时候。望你们将这材料校阅后，刊载此一问题，以便广大群众采用。这仅是初步写的材料，一定会有缺点的。同时这个材料是根据我区的情形写的，别的地区，因气候不同，或多或少是会有变更的。希望各地技术高才先生们，见后多多提些批评指正。
    惊蛰插笋的柿树方法：软枣树粗时，能用插笋接（插接法）。先用斧子劈开树母子（砧木），用尖锐的刀子把柿树码子（接穗）削成三棱形，插好后（应将码子的形成层和砧木的形成层紧接）。不用什么缠绕，也是很坚固的。然后用泥糊着；离地面高时用两根棍绑在泥糊头的下边，再用别的东西把周围垫好，弄土盖好。这样的做法，能够活的稳。插笋接树最好用黄蜡、苜杨、猪心油三样熬成浆糊，照缝糊着，能保持风吹日晒，如没这些东西还用泥糊。
    软枣树还有一种接法：柿花开时，用扣码接（芽接），扣开码芽背面有一半米粒的样子能活的稳。平面也行，先把软枣树皮割成丁字形，后把削好的码子扣上，用麻缠紧就行啦。如果有缝隙是不会活的。
    梨树的接法：梨树的接法也是惊蛰插笋，用斧子劈开砧木，把接穗削成两个面如刀棱形，皮靠外边插，用泥糊着就妥了。
    梨树还有一种接法：割麦以后扣码接（芽接法）。使用新枝有叶子的码，把叶截了，留叶柄，剥开里面是凸的就活的稳，有孔洞是不会活的。此外在立秋的时候，梨树也能插技接的，不用截去叶子。
    杏树也是惊蛰接：小杏接大杏，要连年接，今年插笋，后年扣码，接两次果子格外大，一次也行，办法同上（柿、梨）。杏树接后，还得看虫（接着四五天后注意看虫），不然的话，虫会咬坏芽子，怕活不了。桃树也能接杏树，杏树也能接桃树。红、黄李子树也能接桃杏树，桃杏树也能接红、黄李子树。这四种树插枝接都是在惊蛰，扣码都是在麦收以后，其办法同于柿、梨树等。
    杜梨、海棠、酸梅、沙果四种树都能接花红树，还能接苹果树，苹果树接两次果子格外大。其办法同于桃杏树。梨籽生出来的树，也还得接，不接梨不好吃。
    接枣树惊蛰插笋（不能扣码）：甲、接黄栋树，小满扣码，使用去年树上长的旧条。黄栋树暑伏插枝接也能扣码，如果树粗能插笋，如树细就用扣码。乙、柳树能接桃树，味道是苦的但也能吃。丙、桑树接梨树不易活，用靠树的办法就能活。桑树接梨很好吃，果皮色也很好看。丁、小桑叶树能接大桑叶树，可在麦收以后用扣码接法。
    压树法（压条法）：如桑树很好压，不几天就会生根的。其他果树的压枝春天压着到秋罢就有了根，想往别处移栽都行的。如果树枝高就不便压枝，可用盆子盛土支起压也行。果树枝压树不用接。压果子树根还得接。树干上孳生的小树条也能压栽。
    靠树的方法：除松、椿、杨（插条可活，不必接）、泡桐等树不能靠外，余下都能靠，把两方面的皮削破，捆到一块，就不用理它了，秋后把果木根割断（接穗），把嫌树头砍了（砧木的上部），即换成果树头啦！
    种树方法（播种方法）：核桃树最好在白露带青皮种，本年就出来了。秋罢种上干核桃，本年就不出啦。桃、杏的果实成熟了本年种上不能出。种在冬天时候，第二年春天，早早就出来了。养梨树要种杜梨籽。秋罢弄开杜梨果，晒干保存起来。到春天种上，秋罢就能移栽。桑树籽随种随出，也得晒干后搓开去种，把地耙平，撒在地上，用竹爬子搂一遍即成功啦。榆、柳是春天种的（榆钱籽、柳骨须籽（柳絮），种籽小都不能种深。
    栽树方法：栽小树时，先刨穴，栽时，树干要靠边，用土埋了；把树向上提提根就舒展了，然后培土，踏实。树大了栽时多截去头。要记阴阳面，阴面发黑，阳面发白。阳向阳，阴向阴容易活。栽大树必须多剪去大枝条，才容易活的。小树不要截头，泡桐树一年生的苗栽了不好活，必须要养二年的苗。还不要去青叶，一去青叶就会晒皮的。一般的树都分四季栽，栽花椒树最好是伏天。栽柏树时，先刨成穴，把树栽到穴内，然后灌水，摇动摇动根部，根粘上了泥，等到水渗入土后，再盖土，踏实。移栽树是秋天和冬天最好，“春天栽树树害病，冬天栽树树做梦。”阴雨时最好栽葡萄，春天栽还得压。要想结的果大，必须靠接，不管什么树都能靠，光靠偏枝也不会结大果实的。软枣树和枣树不管什么树都能靠的。花椒树要去掉毛腿子（冗枝），才有大收成，核桃树打时（收获果实）在白露，过了这几天就不要打（恐伤树皮，有损生长）。柿树坏了锯了个半桩子，还能生新的枝条（指格五岔股锯而言），锯后必须要用斧子砍砍，砍成斜茬就好了，才易生长新枝的。家家户户养苗圃，无穷利益说不完，天气稍微旱些也能收果子，因为果树根深能吸收水分。
    编者按：石玉殿同志是出席第一届全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的农业劳动模范，平原省林县东冶村人。他十四岁就学会接树，今年五十九岁了。四十多年来，他给东冶村附近各村接活果树二万多棵。还教会一百五十多人接树。在长期的劳动过程中，他积累了丰富的果树培育经验，还创造了很多宝贵的果树培育方法，像果树枝干钻孔法，苹果树切皮法，花椒剪枝法等，能使不结果的果树果枝结果。由于他积极帮助村民接树植树，林县东冶村一带，果林密布，村村相接，农民收入一天天增多。今天发表石玉殿树木培育法一文，可供各地研究与学习。文内所谈气节，只适用于华北地区，东北、西北等较寒冷的地区则要晚一些，其他较温暖的地区则可提早一些。（附图片）
