　　Beijing Women Hold Radio Rally to Accuse U.S.
　  400,000 People Listen to Accusations and Participate in Signature Voting
    [By Our Newspaper] The Beijing Democratic Women's Federation and the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station jointly held the Beijing Women's Radio Rally Against U.S. Arming of Japan on the 24th. The central venue was set up at the broadcasting station, and listening sessions or small groups were set up in streets, alleys, courtyards, most public places, and shops throughout the city. The number of listeners in the city reached more than 400,000. Among them, in addition to the vast number of working women and housewives, there were also nuns, Buddhist nuns, childcare workers, shop employees and their families, and patients in hospitals. At the beginning of the meeting, Liang Keping, the chairman of the meeting, used the comparison of women's lives before and after the liberation of Beijing to illustrate that Beijing women must no longer live the days of being oppressed and enslaved. They must continue to strengthen the anti-U.S. and aid-Korea ranks of Beijing women with resolute actions. Then, Han Wenjing and three others made accusations. Han Wenjing, who lives in the Second District of Beijing, used her personal experience in Wanggan Village, Yunmeng County, Hubei Province in 1938 to accuse the Japanese invaders of raping and massacring a large number of women. Li, an old woman from the First District, accused the Japanese invaders of shooting her son and insulting her when they bombed and burned Gaoyang (she was pregnant at the time). But when she talked about her life after liberation, she was so moved that she shouted: "Thank you, Chairman Mao!" She said enthusiastically and excitedly: "Chairman Mao! I think you heard my words. I hope you take good care of your health and lead the People's Government for ten thousand years!" The third accuser was Old Woman Chang, who had suffered from the ravages of Japanese, American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries for three generations. When the Eight-Nation Alliance attacked Beijing, her father was killed by American devils; when the Japanese invaders occupied Beijing, they forced her mother to beg for food and starve to death. She herself had ten children, eight of whom died from illness and starvation. The last person to accuse was Wang Shuyun, who had been wronged for eleven years. She said that the People's Government had finally avenged the injustice of her two elder brothers being buried alive by traitors and bullies in Tianjin. During the accusations, the blood, tears, and hatred of each accuser aroused the anger of every listener. Thousands of listening masses shouted in unison: "No Japanese devils are allowed to come again!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Avenge our dead sisters!"
    After the accusation, the conference accepted a suggestion from a sister and passed a letter of tribute to Cai Chang, chairman of the National Women's Federation. Comrade Cai Chang immediately gave a radio speech to the conference on the phone, which greatly encouraged the listening masses. Then, Zhou Ruiming, a housewife in the Second District and a representative of the People's Congress of all circles in the city, proposed six patriotic covenants to challenge the women of the city, and the listening masses in various places immediately responded enthusiastically. Finally, a vote was held on supporting the conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers and on the peaceful settlement of the Japanese issue, and the listening masses in various places solemnly raised their peace-loving arms. Afterwards, the conference broadcasted the response from various places.
    This radio rally further enlightened the patriotic enthusiasm and the will to fight against the enemy among the vast number of women. Fifteen old women fainted on the spot due to excessive grief and anger. All the female workers of the shoe factory of the Clothing General Factory, all the nuns of the Rehe Diocese, 334 female Buddhists, and many other sisters called or wrote to express their views after listening to the accusations and Comrade Cai Chang's telephone broadcast: They will implement the patriotic covenant. During and after the conference, women in various places rushed to call or write to the Municipal People's Broadcasting Station and the Municipal Democratic Women's Federation to express their response to the call of the conference. As of 7 pm on the 25th, the number of respondents reached 294,704. Nearly 2,000 phone calls were received that day.
    In addition, phone calls and written challenges to Zhou Ruiming's challenge came one after another. There were collective and individual written challenges, and 1,071 pieces have been received. These written challenges are full of patriotic enthusiasm. Sixty-six women in Section 18 of the Fourth District guaranteed to donate books and newspapers to the Volunteer Army every month. Sun Zhiying guaranteed "to encourage her Christian husband to participate in the Three-Self Reform Movement with the greatest strength." Zhang Jinru guaranteed to encourage her husband and son to bravely kill the enemy. More than 700 women in the Inner Second District collectively made a covenant to ensure that after the "May 1st" Labor Day, every Sunday will be "Resist America and Aid Korea Day" to study current affairs and conduct anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda.

　　北京妇女举行广播控诉大会
　  四十万人收听控诉并参加签名投票
    【本报讯】北京市民主妇女联合会和北京市人民广播电台，于二十四日联合举办北京妇女反对美国武装日本广播控诉大会，中心会场设在广播台，并在全市各街道、胡同、宅院、大部分公共场所和商户分设收听大会或小组。全市收听人数达四十万以上。其中除了广大的劳动妇女、家庭妇女外，还包括了修女、尼姑、托儿所工作人员、商店职工和家属，以及医院里的病人。大会开始，由大会主席梁柯平以北京解放前后妇女生活的对比，来说明北京妇女决不能再过那种受压迫当奴隶的日子，必须以坚决的行动，继续壮大北京妇女抗美援朝的队伍。继即由韩文菁等四人进行控诉。住在北京市第二区的韩文菁以她一九三八年在湖北云梦县王干村亲身的见闻，控诉了日寇强奸和屠杀大批妇女的暴行。一区的李老太太控诉了日寇在高阳轰炸和烧杀时，枪伤她儿子、侮辱她自己的罪行（当时她还怀着孕）。但当她谈到解放后的生活时，感动得连声高喊：“感谢毛主席！”她热情激动地说：“毛主席！我想你是听见我的话的，我希望你老人家好好保养身体，领导人民政府万万年！”第三个控诉的，是三辈子受尽日、美帝国主义和国民党反动派残害的常老太太。八国联军攻北京时，她父亲被美国鬼子打死；日寇占领北京时，逼得她母亲讨饭饿死。她自己生过十个孩子，连病带饿就死掉了八个。最后上台控诉的是含冤十一年的王淑云，她说：她的两个哥哥在天津被汉奸恶霸活埋的冤仇，今天才由人民政府给报了仇。在控诉当中，每个控诉者的血泪和仇恨，都激起了每个收听者的愤怒。几千处的收听群众都同声高呼：“不准日本鬼子再来！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“为死难姊妹们报仇！”
    控诉后，大会接受一位姊妹的建议，通过向全国妇女联合会主席蔡畅致敬的信。蔡畅同志当即在电话里向大会作广播讲话，给收听群众以很大的鼓舞。接着第二区家庭妇女、市各界人民代表会议代表周瑞明大娘，提出六项爱国公约向全市妇女挑战，各地收听群众立即热烈应战。最后，举行关于拥护五大国缔结和平公约和关于和平解决日本问题的投票，各处收听群众都严肃地举起爱好和平的手臂来。接着，大会并播送各处响应号召的情况。
    这次广播控诉大会，进一步启发了广大妇女群众爱国的热情和敌忾同仇的意志。有十五位大娘因悲愤过度，当场晕倒。被服总厂制鞋厂全体女工、热河教区全体修女、三百三十四位女佛教徒，以及其他很多的姐妹们，听了控诉和蔡畅同志的电话广播后，都纷纷打电话或写信表示：要贯彻执行爱国公约。各处妇女群众，在大会进行中和会后，更争向市人民广播电台和市民主妇女联合会打电话或写信，表示响应大会号召，截至二十五日下午七时止，响应号召者计达二十九万四千七百零四人。当天接到的电话近二千次。
    另外，向周瑞明大娘应战的电话和应战书，接连不断地传来。应战书有集体的、个人的，已收到一千零七十一件。这些应战书都充溢了爱国主义的热情。四区十八段六十六个妇女，保证每月捐献书报给志愿军。孙志英保证“以最大的力量鼓励信奉基督教的丈夫，参加三自革新运动”。张锦如保证鼓励丈夫和儿子英勇杀敌。内二区七百多妇女，则集体订约保证：“五一”节后，以每星期日为“抗美援朝日”学习时事，进行抗美援朝宣传。
