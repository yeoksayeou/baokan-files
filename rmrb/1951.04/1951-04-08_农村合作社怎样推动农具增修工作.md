　　Due to the long-term damage caused by the enemy and puppet regimes and the shackles of the feudal land system, the lack of farm tools in rural areas is quite serious. According to a survey from the First National Farm Tool Conference, the general lack of farm tools in rural areas across the country is above 20%. Therefore, the planned augmentation and repair of existing farm tools has become one of the most important tasks in agricultural production.
    Since the beginning of spring, rural cooperatives across the country have started production, repair and supply work, and have achieved considerable success. In only six counties in Shanxi Province, namely Xiangning, Lishi, Xiangyuan, and Lingchuan, 12,480 farm tools have been augmented and repaired. Some regions have also combined the augmentation and repair of existing farm tools with a focus on promoting new types of farm tools.
    Most cooperatives in various regions carry out this work by organizing iron and woodworking artisans and placing processing orders with urban farm tool industries. Only a small number have set up their own factories for processing.

  I. Organizing Iron and Woodworking Artisans for Manufacturing
    How can iron and woodworking artisans be organized to serve agriculture? The best method is to convene production and sales conferences of iron and woodworking artisans and farmer representatives. These conferences can connect scattered small artisans with the vast number of farmers. In Tangyin County, Pingyuan Province, twenty contracts and sixty agreements were signed at five representative meetings, with a total transaction of more than 3,100 farm tools. Cooperatives in Chahar Province signed 36 contracts through such meetings, totaling 24,377 iron and wood farm tools.
    These meetings also play a certain role in improving specifications and quality. Yuan Yin, a carpenter in the Sixth District of Tangyin County, guaranteed the quality of his seeders at the representative meeting: elm body, willow hopper, no jumping in three steps, no skewing in five steps. Through consultation at the meeting, the prices of farm tools were also more reasonable. The price of each hoe blade ordered through the production and sales conference in Tangyin was lower than the price asked by blacksmiths by five catties of millet. The farm tools ordered through the production and sales conference in Chahar Province were 15% to 20% cheaper than the previous market price. Why are the prices relatively cheaper? Mainly because the sales of small artisans' products are guaranteed. Blacksmiths and other artisans in Southern Chahar stated after signing the contract: "In the past, because few products were sold, we had to raise the price a bit; now that the sales are guaranteed and the quantity has increased, although the price of each product is lower, it still adds up to make money."
    In organizing this work, cooperatives must help small artisans solve the problems of raw materials and funds, such as supplying coal, iron (and timber in some areas), and raising necessary funds. Some cooperatives have already done this. For example, Dazhai Village in Yushe County, Shanxi Province, supplied two blacksmith furnaces with 748 catties of iron and coal, and the entire village augmented and repaired 484 farm tools of various sizes. Cooperatives in some areas of Xiuwu, Pingyuan Province, solved the difficulties of blacksmith furnace funds and raw materials by launching village cooperatives to raise shares and collect scrap iron.

  II. Placing Processing Orders with Urban Farm Tool Industries
    Rural cooperatives placing processing orders with urban farm tool industries is an important way to obtain a large number of farm tools to meet the needs of members. Most areas in Northeast China have adopted this method. The Hailin County Cooperative in Songjiang Province ordered 40,000 catties of plowshares from the Xinnuo Iron Factory in Mudanjiang City. Urban farm tool industries have a large production volume, but the disadvantage is that they do not understand the quantity and specifications required by farmers, and there is great blindness in production. Therefore, the cooperative acting as an intermediary to coordinate the ordering of farm tools plays a significant role in promoting the integration of production and sales. Cooperatives must do a good job in investigation and research to understand the needs of members and the production capacity of factories. Cooperatives in various regions have adopted two methods in conducting investigation and research. One is to convene various meetings. Cooperatives in Linjiang County, Liaodong Province, and Chengde City, Rehe Province, etc., convened member meetings, member representative meetings, or joint meetings of district and village cooperative directors to understand the needs of members. The other method is to conduct in-depth investigations from the bottom up, make plans (including specifications, quality, quantity, etc.), and then the higher-level cooperatives summarize them and separately sign contracts with the farm tool industry for purchase. There are also cases where farm tool samples are displayed in market towns, or samples are distributed in advance, and after farmers try them and find them suitable, orders are placed accordingly.

  III. Issues to Note
    First, cooperatives must obtain the assistance of state-owned trading companies, state banks, agricultural technology departments, etc., in order to solve the problems of raw materials, funds, and improving farm tool manufacturing technology. This is a very important link. The iron furnace and cart shop industries in Yingkou County, Liaodong Province, were able to obtain coke for opening their furnaces thanks to the assistance of the state-owned Coal Construction Company. For example, Tangyin, Pingyuan, obtained 30 million yuan in agricultural tool loans from the bank, solving the problem of funding difficulties. In some areas where the cooperative foundation is weak, the supply of farm tools by the trade department plays an even greater role.
    Second, attach importance to the production capacity of private farm tool industries and organize them to serve agriculture in a planned way. Private farm tool manufacturing industries in various regions have considerable production capacity. The machinery industry in Tianjin produced and sold 300 iron plows last year, and the agricultural tool smelting industry produced more than 64,000 catties of farm tools in January this year. The copper and ironware industry has the capacity to produce 3,000 to 5,000 sprayers per month. There are 64 private ironworkers in Jilin City, including four specializing in plowshares, each capable of producing 1,400 per day. Last year, they sold 50,000 plowshares. Private businesses in some regions are also very active in transporting and selling farm tools. The Handan Ironware Industry in Hebei Province uses various methods to operate farm tools and related hardware materials. Hongxiang alone transported 198 plow beams from Jincheng and 1,000 plow bottoms from Yangquan in one month. This should also be utilized.
    Third, closely integrate supply and marketing operations. Cooperatives in various regions can mostly grasp this link in specific implementation. Before supplying farm tools to members, they first promote the sales of agricultural and sideline products of the members, or organize the exchange of products for farm tools. For example, cooperatives in some counties in Songjiang Province, Northeast China, organized large-scale domestic sales of products, and 70% of the yellow tobacco in the Pingling area found a market. The director of the cooperative in that area said: "If we don't use this method to solve the sales of our tobacco and hemp, the farmers will not have money to buy farm tools this year." The method of exchanging products for farm tools is also widely used by cooperatives in various regions. For example, among the more than 24,000 iron and wood farm tools organized and traded through the production and sales conference in Chahar Province, some were exchanged for naked oats and naked oat flour. The farm tools traded and ordered by cooperatives in the Liaocheng area of Pingyuan Province through the exchange and ordering of farm tools between regions included 351 iron shovels, 9,000 bamboo rakes, and 17,110 sickle heads.
    Fourth, focus on promoting new farm tools to members. Cooperatives in Northeast China and North China have already started this work. Cooperatives in various parts of Northeast China have acted as agents for selling new-style farm tools such as double-wheeled wasteland reclamation plows and small paddy field plows manufactured by factories under the Northeast People's Government Agricultural and Forestry Department and the agricultural and forestry departments of various provinces. The Tongxian area cooperative also bought new-style walking plows and weeding machines from farms and distributed them to various cooperatives for demonstration.
    In organizing the supply of farm tools, rural cooperatives in various regions should, in addition to paying attention to the above issues, also focus on cotton, hemp, and special product areas, and mutual aid groups, and pay attention to grasping the seasonality of farm tool supply.

　　农村合作社怎样推动农具增修工作
　　近宇
    由于敌伪长时期的破坏和封建土地制度的束缚，各地农村缺乏农具情况相当严重。据全国第一次农具会议的调查，各地农村一般的缺乏农具在百分之二十以上。因而，有计划地增修原有农具就成为农业生产中的重要工作之一。
    全国各地农村合作社根据这一情况，入春以来，相继开始了制修供应工作，并获得相当成绩。仅山西省乡宁、离石、襄垣、陵川等六个县，已增修农具一万二千四百八十件。部分地区并结合增修原有农具重点推广新式农具。
    各地合作社多以组织铁木手工业者与向城镇农具工业加工订购两种方法进行这一工作，自己设厂加工的为数很少。
  一、组织铁木手工业者制造
    怎样组织铁木手工业者为农业服务呢？最好的方法是召开铁木手工业者和农民代表的产销会议。这种会议可以把分散的小手工业者和广大的农民联系起来。平原省汤阴县在五处代表会中，共订了二十件合同，六十件协议，成交农具达三千一百余件。察哈尔省合作社通过这种会议签订合同三十六件，计铁木农具二万四千三百七十七件。
    这种会议在提高规格品质上也有一定的作用。汤阴县六区木匠袁银，在代表会上向农民保证耧的质量：槐木身，柳木斗，三步不跳，五步不斜。通过会议的协商，农具价格也较合理。汤阴经产销会议订购的锄板，每个比铁匠索要的价钱低小米五斤。察哈尔省通过产销会议订购的农具较以往市价便宜百分之十五至二十。为什么价格会比较便宜呢？主要是由于保证了小手工业者产品的销路。察南铁匠和其他工匠在订合同后表示：过去因产品销的少，所以要把价钱提高一些；现在销路有了保证，数量也增多了，每件产品的价格虽然低点，但合计起来还是赚钱。
    合作社在组织这项工作中，必须帮助小手工业者解决原料和资金问题，如供应煤、铁（部分地区也有需木材的），和筹措必要的资金。若干合作社已这样做了。如山西榆社县大寨村供给两个铁匠炉七百四十八斤铁和燃煤，全村共增修了大小农具四百八十四件。平原修武若干地区合作社，用发动村合作社集股和搜集废铁的办法，解决了铁匠炉资金与原料的困难。
  二、向城镇农具工业加工订货
    农村合作社向城镇农具工业加工订货，是取得大量农具满足社员需要的重要方法。东北多数地区都采用这一方法。松江省海林县合作社向牡丹江市信和铁工厂订铧子四万斤。城镇农具业生产量较大，但缺点是不了解农民需要的数量、规格，生产中有很大的盲目性。因此合作社居间统筹订制农具，对促进产销结合的作用很大。合作社必须作好调查研究工作，了解社员需要和工厂生产能力等情况。各地合作社在进行调查研究工作中采用的方法有两种。一种是召开各种会议。东北辽东省临江县，热河省承德市等地合作社召开了社员大会、社员代表会或是区村合作社主任联席会议等，了解社员需要的情况。另一办法是自下而上深入调查，做出计划（包括规格、品质、数量等），由上级社汇总起来，分别向农具业订合同洽购。也有利用集镇展览农具样品，或先期分发样品，等农民试用合适后再依样订造的。
  三、应注意的几个问题
    第一，合作社必须取得国营贸易公司、国家银行、农业技术等部门的协助，才能很好地解决原料、资金和改进农具制造技术等问题。这是一个很重要的环节。辽东省营口县铁炉、车铺业，由于国营煤建公司的协助才得到开炉的焦炭。如平原汤阴取得银行农具贷款三千万元，解决了资金困难问题。若干合作社基础薄弱的地区，贸易部门供应农具更有很大的作用。
    第二，重视私营农具工业的生产力量，组织它们有计划的为农业服务。各地私营农具制造业具有相当生产能力。天津市机器工业去年曾制售铁犁三百架，农具冶制工业今年一月份共生产农具六万四千余斤，铜铁器工业每月就具有生产喷雾器三千至五千架的能力。吉林市私营铁工翻砂业共六十四家，其中专门做铧子的就有四家，每家每日可产一千四百个。去年曾售出铧子五万个。若干地区的私营商业对运销农具也是很积极的。河北省邯郸铁货业采用各种方式经营农具及有关五金材料，只鸿祥号一家在一个月内就由晋城等地运来犁辕一百九十八根，由阳泉运来犁底一千付。这也是应该加以利用的。
    第三，供销业务要密切结合。各地合作社在具体执行中多能掌握这一环节。他们在供应社员农具之前，多先把社员的农业副业产品推销出去，或是组织产品与农具的交换。如东北松江省若干县合作社大量组织产品内销，平岭区的黄烟有百分之七十找到销路。该区合作社主任说：“若不用这个办法来解决我们烟麻的销路，今年农民就没有钱买农具。”以产品交换农具的办法也被各地合作社普遍采用，如察哈尔省合作社通过产销会议组织成交的二万四千多件铁木农具中，就有一部分是用莜麦、莜面交换的。平原聊城专区合作社采用地区之间的农具交换和订购办法成交的农具就有铁锹三百五十一把、竹芭子九千张、镰头一万七千一百十张。
    第四，有重点地向社员推广新农具。东北、华北等地合作社已开始进行这一工作。东北各地合作社即代销了东北人民政府农林部及各省农林厅所属工厂制造的双轮开荒洋犁、水田小洋犁等新式农具。通县专区合作社也向农场买了新式步犁和锄草机分配到各社示范。
    各地农村合作社在组织农具供应工作中，除应注意上述问题外，还应把工作重点放在棉、麻、烟特产区和互助组上，并注意掌握供应农具的季节性。
