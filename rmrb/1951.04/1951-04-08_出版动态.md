Statistics of Publications by Xinhua Bookstore Northeast in 1950

According to statistics from the Northeast General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore: In 1950, 33,703,144 copies of textbooks were published, an increase of 99.4% compared to 1949; 6,219,000 copies of literacy textbooks for workers and peasants were published, and 5,111,000 copies of general books were published, an increase of 67.9%; 7,521,544 copies of magazines were published, an increase of 175.6%; 2,773,486 New Year pictures and propaganda posters were published, an increase of 78.9%. A total of 56,020,000 copies of books and periodicals were published, more than double the total of 24,700,000 copies published in 1949.

Northeast Publishes Popular and Small-Sized "Agricultural Technology" Magazine

To meet the needs of developing agricultural production, the Northeast "Agricultural Technology" bi-monthly magazine was launched in March. This is a popular and small-sized publication aimed at improving agricultural technology, exchanging production experience, and popularizing agricultural science knowledge, targeting district and village cadres and the masses of farmers.

With the forward development of agricultural production, improving agricultural cultivation techniques and combining agricultural technology research with farmers' production practices will greatly help improve the yield and quality of agricultural products. The publication of such a magazine is timely and necessary.

Regarding Medical and Health Periodicals

According to available data, there are currently more than 50 types of medical and health periodicals across the country, which is beneficial to medical and health research. However, there are not enough popular periodicals that popularize medical and health knowledge, which is a shortcoming. At the same time, the content of various periodicals is too general, which is also a drawback.

The "Chinese Journal of Internal Medicine" monthly, published by the East China Branch of the People's Military Medical Society, published three treatises on schistosomiasis japonica in Volume 3, Issue 3. This disease is an epidemic in the Yangtze River region, and the journal has reported on it in the past. Such continuous attention to the research and prevention of local diseases in combination with the actual local situation is a direction that medical and health periodicals should pay attention to. The "Chinese Journal of Surgery" monthly, sponsored by the same society, also published a "Special Issue on War Injuries" in Volume 1, Issue 3. At present, medical workers from all over the country are actively organizing volunteer medical surgical teams to go to Korea to carry out battlefield rescue work. To cooperate with this great action, it is also necessary to strengthen technical education in wartime trauma medical emergency treatment. Secondly, "Acupuncture Therapy," which has received widespread attention from the masses, and "Tissue Therapy," which is suitable for the needs of the broad masses of people, are rarely reported and researched in various medical journals. This should be given attention, introduced, and promoted as much as possible.

A Newly Published "New World Map"

The "New World Map" (edited by Tu Sicong and Wang Zhen) recently published by the World and Geography Society has new materials and exquisite drawings, and is considered to be one of the better world maps published so far. This map has the following characteristics: (1) It does not adopt the old map's method of dividing and listing countries in a flat manner, but uses regions as units and sets colors according to terrain layering; in addition to the main map, there are various illustrations and supplementary maps as supplementary materials; (2) The text explanations are concise and summarized. This map is suitable for teaching in high schools and above and for general reference.

National Peking Library Prints Library Cards

In order to help libraries in various places with classification and cataloging, and to solve the difficulty of writing cards by printing them, the National Peking Library began printing library application cards in December last year. Currently, 39 units have subscribed to the cards. The cards are temporarily made for books published after September 1950, and the classification is temporarily based on Liu Guojun's "Chinese Book Classification Method." Each book has three cards, which are registered according to the title, author, and nature of the book. According to the current situation, each card costs 200 RMB. With 300 to 400 new books per month, the required cost is about 200,000 RMB. This work of the Peking Library can save the work of classifying and making cards for various libraries, which is very meaningful. However, to do this work well, the classification and cataloging methods of libraries across the country must first be reasonably unified. Secondly, the cards currently printed include a relatively complete collection of books, which requires a larger cost because they must be purchased in full sets, so they are not very suitable except for a few larger libraries. Therefore, we hope that the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, the General Administration of Publication, and the library community across the country will study this issue, and hope that after a period of time, these printed cards can meet the needs of libraries across the country.

Promote Newspaper Reading Experience

According to the reflections in propaganda manuals from various places, reading newspapers is one of the main methods used by propagandists to promote to workers and peasants. At present, propagandists in various places have created effective newspaper reading experiences. The article "Reading Newspapers and Casual Talks" in the fifth issue of Tianjin's "Propaganda Manual" points out that the best way to read newspapers is to read, speak, and discuss at the same time. Many propaganda manuals mention that reading word by word is ineffective. The article "Reading Newspapers" in the fifth issue of the Northwest "Propagandist Manual" advocates turning "reading the newspaper" into speaking the newspaper. There are four key points for speaking the newspaper: first, have a clear understanding; second, meet the needs ("the worst thing is that the masses want west but you talk east"); third, have everyone speak up (discussion); fourth, be vivid and colorful. The third issue of "Propagandist" in Central South introduced that when Shen Baixuan, a propagandist from the Fuxin Flour Mill in Hankou, read newspapers, he made gestures, used metaphors, and had expressions, which was very effective. The fourth issue of "Propaganda Experience" in the Northeast, "Several Experiences of Zhang Weiming's Newspaper Reading Group," proposed methods to overcome the contempt for newspaper reading among some workers. These good newspaper reading methods are worthy of study and adoption by propagandists in various places.

Distribute Newspapers to Urban and Rural Readers in Large Quantities

The Mingshui County Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Heilongjiang Province issued a challenge to the entire province of Heilongjiang to distribute newspapers to urban and rural readers in large quantities. One of the conditions is to ensure that every district, village, and tun in the county has newspapers, with a minimum of one copy in each tun. It also proposed to pay attention to mass work in the promotion and distribution: "Make sure to visit and solicit opinions from subscribers on a regular basis." Heilongjiang Daily published and supported this competition, pointing out in a short commentary titled "Distribute Newspapers to Urban and Rural Readers in Large Quantities" that it is necessary to "do a good job in publicizing the distribution of newspapers, and prevent the phenomenon of forced distribution in order to simply pursue numbers."

In areas where rural postal services are relatively imperfect, overcoming difficulties to promote newspapers to the countryside is an important political task of distribution work; and constantly paying attention to mass work when distributing newspapers is the key to doing a good job in distribution work. Heilongjiang Daily and the post office should pay serious attention to this issue.

Good Newspaper Reading Groups

In the past, the masses in Yong'anbao Village, Fifth District, Liuhe, Liaodong, had nothing to do at night, and they chatted and made trouble. Winter Changhai, a veteran who returned to the village and became a propaganda committee member in the branch, immediately paid attention to this matter and cooperated with elementary school teachers to create a newspaper reading group. Reading newspapers, telling stories, learning to read, and learning to sing became the center of cultural propaganda activities in the village, and played a significant role in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Two months later, it had developed into a small rural library with more than 160 kinds of rural popular reading materials and comic strips. This is a vivid story of a newspaper reading group published by Liaodong Dazhong Daily on March 7th; on the same day, it also published information and experiences of other good newspaper reading groups. Obviously, such newspaper reading groups have actually played the role of propagandists, and publishing such materials is of great value.

Gains of Professors and Writers Participating in Land Reform and Rural Surveys

Beijing and Tianjin newspapers have recently published many articles on the thoughts and gains of professors and writers after participating in land reform. Such as Xiao Qian's "Learning in Land Reform," Wu Jingchao's "Experience of Participating in Land Reform Work," Zhu Guangqian's "Understanding the Greatness of New China from Participating in Land Reform," and He Lin's "Participating in Land Reform Changed My Thinking," etc., all used their specific observations to illustrate the justice of land reform and the progress of their understanding of farmers, etc., and changed their methods and attitudes of doing scholarship because of this living education.

Shanghai Jiefang Daily consecutively published two issues of "Special Issue of East China Literary and Art Work Investigation Group" on March 28th and 29th, including the thoughts, experiences, and creative materials of several writers after investigating literary and artistic work among workers and peasants in Shandong. The preface to the special issue stated that the 52 people who participated in this investigation and visit all had abundant gains.

These articles published by professors and writers in newspapers show that they have gained a lot from participating in land reform and mass literary and artistic work, and quickly spread the impact they received from the struggles and activities of workers and peasants to other intellectuals, so that other intellectuals can also be educated.

　　出版动态
  一九五○年东北新华书店出版物统计
    据新华书店东北总分店统计：一九五○年计出版教科书三三、七○三、一四四册，比一九四九年增加百分之九九·四；出版工农文化课本六、二一九、○○○册，一般书籍五、一一一、○○○册，增加百分之六七·九；出版杂志七、五二一、五四四册，增加百分之一七五·六；出版年画、宣传画二、七七三、四八六张，增加百分之七八·九。总计出版书刊五六、○二○、○○○册，为一九四九年出版书刊总数二四、七○○、○○○册的一倍以上。
  东北出版通俗小型的《农业技术》杂志
    为适应发展农业生产的需要，东北《农业技术》半月刊已于三月份创刊。这是个通俗小型的，以改进农业技术，交流生产经验，普及农业科学知识为主旨，以区村干部及农民群众为对象的刊物。
    随着农业生产的向前发展，改进农业耕作技术，把农业技术研究和农民生产实践结合起来，将大有助于提高农产品产量质量。这样刊物的出版，是很适时和必要的。
  关于医药卫生期刊
    据现有资料统计，最近各地医药卫生期刊已达五十余种，这是有益于医药、卫生研究的。但普及医药卫生知识的通俗期刊还不多，是一个缺憾。同时各种期刊内容过于一般化，也是一个缺点。
    人民军医社华东分社出版的《内科学报》月刊三卷三期发表了以日本住吸血虫病为主要内容的论著三篇，这种病是长江地区的流行性疾病，过去该刊即有报道。这样连续地结合当地实际情况，重视地方病的研究防治，是医药卫生期刊应该注意的一个方向。该社主办的《外科学报》月刊，一卷三期也出了《战伤专号》。目前各地医务工作者纷纷组织抗美援朝志愿医疗手术队，到朝鲜去作战地救护工作，配合这一伟大行动，加强战时外伤医疗急救的技术教育也是必要的。其次，受广大群众注意的《针灸疗法》，及适合于广大人民需要的《组织疗法》，各种医药期刊都很少报道和研究的文字，这是应该加以重视并尽力介绍、推广的。
  一本新出版的《新世界地图》
    世界与地学社最近出版的《新世界地图》（屠思聪、王振编），取材较新、绘制精工，在已出版的世界地图中算是较好的一种。这本地图有如下特点：（一）不采用旧日地图以国为单位的平铺分列法，而以区域为单位，并按地形分层设色；除主图外，还有各种插图和补充用图作补充资料；（二）文字说明，扼要概括。这一本地图适合于高中以上学校讲授和一般参考之用。
  国立北京图书馆制印图书馆用卡片
    国立北京图书馆为帮助各地图书馆分类编目，并用印片的方式来解决写片的困难，从去年十二月起，开始印制图书馆应用卡片，现在订购卡片的图书馆已有三十九个单位。该项卡片暂从一九五○年九月以后出版的书籍做起，分类暂仍根据刘国钧的《中国图书分类法》。每书有卡片三张，分别按书名、著者、性质分类登录。照现在的情形，每张卡片需人民币二百元。每月以三、四百本新书计算，所需费约在二十万元左右。北京图书馆这种工作，可以省却各图书馆分类制卡的工作，是很有意义的。不过要做好这个工作，首先还得把全国图书馆的分类法和编目法合理的统一起来。其次，现在印制的卡片，所收的书籍比较完全，因须全套订购，所需费用较大，除了少数规模较大的图书馆以外，就不很适用。因此，我们希望文化部文物局、出版总署及全国图书馆界，都来研究这个问题，希望经过一个时期，这种印制的卡片，能够适应全国图书馆的需要。
  推广读报经验
    根据各地宣传手册的反映，读报是宣传员对工农群众宣传的主要方法之一。目前各地宣传员已经创造了有效的读报经验。天津《宣传手册》第五期《读报和漫谈》一文里，指出最好的读报方法是又读，又讲，又讨论。许多宣传手册提到一字一字的念，是没有效果的。西北《宣传员手册》第五期《读报》一文，主张把“念报”变成说报。说报有四个要点：一要心里有底；二要满足需要（“最怕是群众要西你讲东”）；三要众人开口（讨论）；四要有声有色。中南《宣传员》三期介绍了汉口福新面粉厂沈柏萱宣传员读报时，做手势，打比喻，有表情，成效很好。东北《宣传经验》第四期《张维明读报组的几点经验》提出克服若干工人轻视读报的方法。这些良好的读报方法，都值得各地宣传员研究、采用。
  把报纸大量发行到城乡读者中去
    黑龙江省明水县邮电局向黑龙江全省发出了把报纸大量发行到城乡读者中去的挑战，条件之一是保证全县各区、村、屯都有报纸，屯最低一份。并提出要在推广发行中注意做群众工作：“做到按期访问征求订户意见”。黑龙江日报发表并支持了这个竞赛，在题为《把报纸大量发行到城乡读者手里》的短评中指出：应该“做好发行报纸的宣传工作，防止单纯追求数字以致强迫摊派的现象”。
    在乡邮比较不健全的地区，克服困难把报纸推广到乡村中去，是发行工作的重要政治任务；而在发行报纸时不断注意做群众工作则是做好发行工作的关键。黑龙江日报和邮局应该认真注意这个问题。
  好的读报组
    辽东柳河五区永安堡村，以前群众到了晚上没有事做，闲谈打闹。退伍军人冬长海回村在支部当宣传委员，立即注意了这件事，和小学教师合作创办了读报组，读报、讲故事、识字、学唱歌，成了村里文化宣传活动的中心，在抗美援朝运动中起了不小的作用，两个月后，已发展成为有一百六十多种农村通俗读物和连环画的小型农村图书室了。这是辽东大众报三月七日发表的一个生动的读报组的故事；在同一天的报纸上，还发表了其他好的读报组的情况和经验。显然，这样的读报组，实际上已起了宣传员的作用，发表这样的材料是有很大的价值的。
  教授和作家参加土地改革和农村调查的收获
    北京、天津各报近来发表了许多教授、作家参加土地改革之后的感想、收获等文章。如萧乾的《在土地改革中学习》吴景超的《参加土地改革工作的心得》，朱光潜的《从参加土地改革认识新中国的伟大》贺麟的《参加土地改革改变了我的思想》等，都用他们具体的观察说明了土地改革的正义性和他们对农民的认识的进步等，并因为这一活的教育而改变了做学问的方法和态度。
    上海解放日报三月二十八、二十九两天连续刊载了《华东文艺工作调查团特辑》两期，包括几个作家写的调查山东工农文艺工作后的感想、体验和创作材料等。在特辑前言中说，参加这次调查访问的五十二个人，都有丰盛的收获。
    教授和作家们在报纸上所发表的这些文章说明他们参加土地改革和群众文艺工作收获很大，并把他们从工农群众的斗争和活动中所受到的影响很快传播给其他知识分子，使其他知识分子也受到教育。
