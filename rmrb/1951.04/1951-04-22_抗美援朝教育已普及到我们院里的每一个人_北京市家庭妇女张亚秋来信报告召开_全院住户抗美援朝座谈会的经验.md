To the Editor:
    To popularize the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement to every household and every person in our courtyard, we decided to hold regular symposiums for all residents to carry out Anti-American and Aid-Korea propaganda. This is a very good form of propaganda, and we have already achieved practical results.
    My home is at 168 Xidan North Street, Beijing. There are more than ten households and more than fifty people in the courtyard. These residents include office workers, students, rickshaw pullers, vendors, etc. After the China Peace Committee issued the "Circular on Responding to the Resolution of the World Peace Council and Popularizing and Deepening the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement Nationwide," I mobilized the residents of our courtyard to hold a symposium on Anti-American and Aid-Korea to raise everyone's awareness of Anti-American and Aid-Korea, so that everyone would take action to protect their motherland. After more than ten days of preparation, with the help of Comrade Zhang Guangfu (bank clerk) in the same courtyard, the first symposium was held on the morning of April 8. Everyone in the courtyard participated. This was unprecedented in our courtyard. At the beginning of the symposium, because everyone lacked experience in holding meetings, they didn't know what to talk about first. After Comrade Zhang Guangfu took the lead in denouncing the aggressive crimes of American imperialism and explaining that Anti-American and Aid-Korea was to defend the security of the motherland and protect one's own life, Zhang Zhitai, a student at Xinsheng Girls' High School, then told everyone about the situation of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement in the school and the heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army in Korea. Everyone was greatly moved, and then spoke out to express their determination to resist America and aid Korea. Based on their actual living conditions, all the residents of the courtyard consciously formulated four patriotic covenants: (1) Participate in the work of resisting America and aiding Korea with practical actions; (2) Resolutely support the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and assist the government in eradicating spies; (3) Pay attention to the hygiene of the courtyard and cherish public property; (4) Strengthen unity and mutual assistance, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. The meeting also elected Xiang Jiping as the security team leader and Liang Haicheng as the sanitation team leader to strengthen the courtyard's fire prevention, anti-espionage, and sanitation work. We also stipulated that meetings should be held once a week, and in addition to discussing current events, other family life issues can also be brought to the meeting for everyone to help solve.
    After the first symposium, the unity, mutual assistance, and labor enthusiasm of all the residents of the courtyard were improved. On April 11, when the cleaning team came to the courtyard to sweep away the garbage, everyone automatically helped the comrades of the cleaning team to carry the soil, and the pile of dirt that had been piled up in the courtyard for more than half a year was pulled out in less than an hour.
    Our second Anti-American and Aid-Korea symposium was held as scheduled on the afternoon of April 14. The meeting reviewed the implementation of the patriotic covenants and adopted the suggestion of Comrade Zhang Zhitai to donate books and newspapers to the Volunteer Army. After the meeting, everyone took action and voluntarily donated money to buy books.
    We have only held two symposiums, which has significantly increased everyone's patriotic enthusiasm. We must persist in this work for a long time. I believe that this is one of the effective ways to conduct patriotic education for citizens. Therefore, I am introducing our experience for your reference.
                                                                                                                                                                                                               Housewife Zhang Yaqiu
    Editor's note: Zhang Yaqiu is an old lady in her sixties. In addition to writing a letter to introduce their work experience, she also enthusiastically came to this newspaper to make a supplementary conversation in person. Their experience shows that publicizing to unorganized masses through activists in the masses is an effective method. It is hoped that all localities will pay attention to this experience.

    抗美援朝教育已普及到我们院里的每一个人
    北京市家庭妇女张亚秋来信报告召开
    全院住户抗美援朝座谈会的经验编辑同志：
    为了使抗美援朝运动普及到我们院子里的每一户，每一人，我们决定定期召开全院住户座谈会，进行抗美援朝的宣传。这是一个很好的宣传方式，我们已经收到了实际的效果。
    我家住在北京市西单北大街一六八号。全院有十多户、五十多人。这些住户中有职员、学生、三轮车工人、摊贩等。在中国人民抗美援朝总会发出“为响应世界和平理事会决议并在全国普及深入抗美援朝运动的通告”后，我就发动本院住户召开抗美援朝座谈会，提高大家对抗美援朝的认识，使每一个人都为了爱护自己的祖国而行动起来。经过十多天的酝酿，在同院张光复同志（银行职员）的帮助下，在四月八日上午举行了第一次座谈会。全院的人都参加了。这是我们院子里空前未有的事情。在座谈会开始的时候，因为大家没有开会的经验，都不知道先谈什么好。经过张光复同志带头控诉美帝国主义的侵略罪行、说明抗美援朝就是为了保卫祖国的安全，保卫自己的生活后，新生女中学生张芝苔接着又向大家讲了学校里抗美援朝运动的情形和志愿军在朝鲜英勇作战的事迹，大家受到很大的感动，于是纷纷发言表示自己抗美援朝的决心。全院住户根据自己实际生活情况自觉地订立了四项爱国公约：（一）用实际行动参加抗美援朝的工作；（二）坚决拥护镇压反革命，协助政府肃清特务；（三）注意本院的卫生，爱惜公物；（四）加强团结互助，开展批评与自我批评。会上又选出了向寄萍为保安组长，梁海城为卫生组长，以加强本院的防火、防特务及卫生等工作。我们并规定了每星期开会一次，除了讨论时事以外，其他的家庭生活问题亦可提到会上讨论，让大家帮助解决。
    开过第一次座谈会以后，全院住户的团结互助和劳动热情都提高了。四月十一日，清洁大队到院里扫除垃圾时，大家自动帮助清洁队的同志抬土，把堆在院里半年多的尘土堆，不到一小时就拉出去了。
    我们第二次的抗美援朝座谈会按期在四月十四日下午召开。会上检查了对爱国公约的执行情况，又通过了张芝苔小同学所提出的给志愿军捐献书报的建议。会后大家就行动起来，纷纷自愿捐钱买书。
    我们仅仅开了两次座谈会，就显著地提高了大家的爱国热情。我们一定要把这个工作长期坚持下去。我认为，这是对市民进行爱国主义教育的有效方式之一，因此，把我们的经验介绍出来，供大家参考。
            家庭妇女  张亚秋
    编者按：张亚秋是一位六十多岁的老太太。她除了写信介绍她们的工作经验外，并且热情地亲自到本报来作了一次补充谈话。她们的经验说明：通过群众中的积极分子对无组织的群众进行宣传，是一个有效的办法。希望各地重视这一经验。
