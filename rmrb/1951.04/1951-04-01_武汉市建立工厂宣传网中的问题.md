　　Problems in Establishing a Factory Propaganda Network in Wuhan
    Duan Wen

　　Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People in the Whole Party," the work of factory propagandists in Wuhan has developed greatly, moving from focusing on key points to universal establishment. Prominent propagandists deeply welcomed by the masses have emerged, such as Yao Guiling, Lü Zhishou, and Shen Baixuan. In current affairs education, spare-time cultural education, patriotic production competitions, model worker selection campaigns, and the movement against the rearmament of Japan by US imperialism, factory propagandists have carried out propaganda and mobilization work among the workers in various ways. The Wuhan Match Factory has, in every movement, made full use of the role of propagandists in a guided manner. For example, during the recent Wuhan Labor Model Conference, the seventeen propagandists not only universally promoted the glory of being elected as labor models throughout the factory but also took the lead in launching a challenge competition to welcome the Labor Model Conference. During the competition, they appropriately put forward slogans for saving and health care, concretely helped lagging production groups, and formulated production competition plans. At the same time, they organized an accusation meeting against the rearmament of Japan by the United States, thereby mobilizing workers to enter a new upsurge of patriotic production competition. Generally speaking, the factory propaganda network in Wuhan has taken initial shape; in the future, it can be expanded and consolidated on the existing basis.

    However, there are still several problems in the current work. First, although many branches have established propagandists, they have not yet conducted systematic propaganda and mobilization work among the masses. Many party organization secretaries have not yet included the leadership of propagandists as a regular item on their work agenda, and the active and regular leadership of propagandists is insufficient, still shifting the propaganda work to some propaganda cadres. This kind of thinking is obviously inconsistent with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's decision to "regard propagandists as an important bridge linking the Party and the people and give them regular leadership, help, and education." Therefore, in places where propagandists have already been established, systematic leadership and management by the Party Committee is the basic key to consolidating propagandists and giving full play to their role.

    Second, the factory Party branches have not paid enough attention to selecting party members and absorbing labor models to serve as propagandists. If the Party's propaganda work cannot have a sufficient number of party members and labor models, it cannot guarantee the political quality of the propagandists, which will affect the development of propaganda work.

    The above problems show that these leading comrades still do not have a sufficient understanding of the necessity and importance of propagandist work. This is specifically manifested in two aspects:

    First, they believe that since there are already party members, why are propagandists needed? The work of propaganda and mobilization of the masses can be arranged for party members to do, and establishing propagandists is just adding another layer of organization. Some people even think that the Party's Organization Department leads the party members, and the Propaganda Department leads the propagandists, which are two separate systems of the Party.

    This view of opposing party members and propagandists is wrong, which shows that they have not yet understood the spirit of the Central Committee's decision: "One of the natural duties of a Communist Party member is to carry out propaganda to the masses of the people anytime and anywhere, to educate the masses of the people tirelessly with a revolutionary spirit, to carry out irreconcilable struggles against all reactionary and erroneous thoughts and views, and to enlighten and raise the awareness of the masses of the people. The lack of regularity and organization in the propaganda work of the masses of the people will inevitably hinder Communist Party members from effectively fulfilling their duties, indulge the propaganda activities of counter-revolutionary elements and the spread of erroneous ideas, hinder the strengthening of the connection between the Party and the masses of the people, and hinder the Party's struggle to overcome bureaucratic and commandist tendencies..." From this, it can be seen that establishing propagandists is a necessary and fixed system to ensure that party members regularly and in an organized way carry out propaganda work to the masses of the people. If the Party does not have a regular propaganda team, it will not be able to fulfill the above tasks, which will inevitably weaken the Party's propaganda work, create opportunities for counter-revolutionary elements to spread rumors and swindle, and allow certain reactionary and erroneous ideas to spread among the masses of the people, endangering the people's cause.

    Second, they are unwilling to let party members and model figures who have high prestige among the masses and are busy with production work serve as propagandists, thinking that they are actually doing propaganda work anyway, and serving as propagandists again will increase their "burden" and affect their work and production.

    The crux of the matter for those who hold this view is: First, they think that propaganda work is always a "burden." From the phenomenon, it seems that it adds a new job, takes up some time, spends some energy, and increases a little "trouble." In fact, the price of these "troubles" is to strengthen the connection between the Party and the people, correct the bad style of bureaucracy and commandism of cadres, reduce the influence of counter-revolutionary activities and erroneous ideas, and pave the way for all work, thereby reducing many real troubles caused by the failure of propaganda work. It can be seen that this is not a burden. If it becomes a burden, it is because propagandists are established formalistically and their effectiveness cannot be fully realized. On the other hand, they think that the work of labor models and cadre party members in other aspects is more important than the work of propagandists, and the work of propagandists is "incidental" and "secondary," and it does not matter if they do not do it, and other "secondary" people can do it. People who hold this view do not deny the necessity and importance of propaganda work in name, but in fact, their understanding is not in line with the spirit of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's decision. Many facts prove that party members and labor models who have the closest contact with the masses, once they become propagandists, do the most propaganda work and play the greatest role. At the same time, after they become propagandists, because the connection with the masses is more regular, it is also more conducive to their own execution of other tasks, strengthening their role in influencing the masses, and increasing their prestige among the masses.

    Finally, it should also be reminded that although the factory propaganda network in Wuhan has taken initial shape, it is necessary to prevent complacency, and the leadership should regularly check the progress of the propaganda work according to the Central Committee's decision to ensure the correct realization of the Central Committee's decision. In the inspection method, it is necessary to grasp the two aspects of step-by-step inspection and in-depth grass-roots level, which cannot be abandoned. That is to say, on the one hand, the leadership of the Party Committee on the work of propagandists should be checked level by level, and the experience of their leadership on the work of propagandists should be summarized. The leadership of the district committee on the propagandists is a relatively important link, because the district committee is responsible for representing the municipal committee in conducting regular leadership of the branch propaganda work, and directly executing the leadership tasks of propagandists of various nature units such as factories, schools, organs, and residents in this district. On the other hand, we should not neglect to go deep into the grass-roots level, but focus on understanding the role played by the propagandists in each movement, pay attention to checking the role played by the propagandists from the ideological harvest of the masses, and summarize the work experience of the propagandists themselves.

　　武汉市建立工厂宣传网中的问题
    段文
    武汉市的工厂宣传员工作，在中共中央发布了“关于在全党建立对人民群众宣传网的决定”后，已经有了很大的发展，从重点建立进入了普遍建立。并且出现了姚桂英、吕志寿、沈柏萱等深受群众欢迎的宣传员。在时事教育、业余文化教育、爱国主义生产竞赛、评选模范运动和反对美帝国主义重新武装日本运动之中，工厂宣传员都以各种方式对工人群众进行了宣传鼓动工作。武汉火柴厂在每一个运动中，都是有领导地充分发挥宣传员的作用。例如在最近武汉市举行劳动模范大会期间，十七个宣传员不仅在全厂普遍展开了当选劳动模范光荣的宣传，而且带头发起迎接劳动模范大会的挑战竞赛。在竞赛中适合时宜地提出节约、保健的口号，具体地帮助生产落后的小组，订生产竞赛计划。同时组织了反对美国重新武装日本的控诉大会，从而动员工人群众进入新的爱国主义生产竞赛热潮。总的说来，武汉市的工厂宣传网已初具规模；今后可以在现有的基础上扩大和巩固。
    但是目前工作中还存在若干问题。首先是许多支部虽已建立了宣传员，但还没有在群众中进行有系统的宣传鼓动工作。有不少党组织书记还没有把对宣传员的领导工作列为自己工作日程的经常项目之一，对宣传员工作主动和经常的领导不够，把宣传工作仍然推卸在部分宣传干部身上。这种思想显然是和中共中央决定“把宣传员看成是联系党和人民群众的重要桥梁而加以经常的领导、帮助和教育”是不相符合的。因此在宣传员已经建立的地方，党委会给以有系统的领导和管理是巩固宣传员并发挥其作用的基本关键。
    其次，工厂党的支部还没有足够注意地来挑选党员和吸收劳动模范担任宣传员。党的宣传工作如不能拥有足够数量的党员和劳动模范，那是不能保证宣传员的政治质量，会影响宣传工作的开展的。
    上述问题说明这些领导同志对宣传员工作的必要性和重要性还认识不足。这具体表现在两方面：
    第一，认为既有党员，何必还要宣传员，对群众的宣传动员工作尽可布置党员去做，再建立宣传员不是多一层组织吗？还有人以为党委组织部领导的是党员，宣传部领导的是宣传员，是党的两套系统。
    这种把党员与宣传员对立起来的看法是错误的，正说明了他们尚未领会中央的决定精神：“共产党员的天职之一，就是随时随地向人民群众进行宣传，以革命精神不疲倦地去教育人民群众，向一切反动的和错误的思想与主张进行不调和的斗争，启发和提高人民群众的觉悟。对人民群众的宣传工作缺乏经常性和组织性的现象，势必妨碍共产党员有效地履行自己的这种职责，放纵反革命分子的宣传活动和错误思想的流传，妨碍党与人民群众联系的加强，妨碍党的克服官僚主义命令主义倾向的斗争……”由此可知，建立宣传员是保证党员经常地和有组织地对人民群众进行宣传工作的一种必要的固定制度。党如果没有一支经常性的宣传队伍，就无法履行上述任务，势必减弱党的宣传工作的力量，造成反革命分子的造谣撞骗，和某些反动的和错误的思想在人民群众中流传，危害人民的事业。
    第二，不愿让在群众中威信较高、生产工作较忙的党员和模范人物担任宣传员，认为他们反正实际上在做宣传工作，再担任宣传员是增加他们的“负担”，会影响他们的工作和生产。
    抱有这种见解的人，症结在于：一则认为宣传员工作总是一个“负担”。从现象上看是增加了一件新的工作，要化去一些时间，费去一些精力，增加一点“麻烦”。实际上这些“麻烦”的代价，是加强了党与人民的联系，纠正了干部的官僚主义与命令主义的恶劣作风，缩小了反革命活动及错误思想的影响，为一切工作开辟了道路，从而减少了许多由于宣传工作未做好而引起的真正麻烦。由此可见，这并不是负担。如果成了负担，那是由于形式主义地建立宣传员，不能充分发挥其效果的缘故。另一方面则认为劳动模范和干部党员在其它方面的工作比宣传员工作更重要些，宣传员工作是“附带”、“次要”的工作，他们不做也无妨，可以让别的“次要”的人去做。有这种看法的人表面上并不否认宣传工作的必要性和重要性，实际上他们的认识和中共中央决定的精神是不相符合的。许多事实证明与群众联系最密切的党员和劳动模范，一旦担任了宣传员，他们作的宣传工作最多，起作用也最大。同时他们担任宣传员之后，由于和群众的联系更加正常，也就更有利于自己执行其它任务，加强自己影响群众的作用，提高自己在群众中的威信。
    最后还应提醒大家一点，武汉市的工厂宣传网虽已初具规模，但须注意防止自满，领导上应当根据中央决定经常检查宣传员工作进行情况，保证中央决定的正确实现。在检查方法上要掌握逐级检查和深入基层这两个不可偏废的方面。这就是说，一方面应逐级检查党委会对宣传员工作的领导，总结他们对宣传员工作领导的经验。区委一级对宣传员的领导是比较要紧的一个环节，因为区委会负责代表市委会进行对于支部宣传工作的经常领导，直接执行对于本区工厂、学校、机关、居民各种不同性质单位的宣传员的领导任务。另一方面不应忽视深入基层，要着重了解宣传员在每一运动中所起的作用如何，注意从群众的思想收获上来检查宣传员所起的作用，总结宣传员本身的工作经验。
