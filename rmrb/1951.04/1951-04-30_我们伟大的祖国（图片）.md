Our Great Motherland
The Chinese People's Air Force is playing a great role in the construction of New China. This is the plane that was recently ordered to bomb the ice dams on the Yellow River in the Suiyuan and Baotou areas. In five days, it bombed and shattered thirteen large ice dams (the longest being over 3,000 meters), enabling the people along the Yellow River to avoid serious disasters during the ice flood season; protecting more than 7,000 hectares of farmland in the Baotou and Saxian areas for planting, and ensuring the livelihoods of more than 300,000 farmers.

    我们伟大的祖国
    中国人民空军在新中国的建设事业中正发挥着伟大的力量。这就是最近奉命到绥远、包头一带炸碎黄河冰坝的飞机。它经过五天的时间，炸碎了大冰坝十三个（最长的达三千多公尺）使黄河沿岸人民，在凌汛期间，避免了严重的灾害；保护了包头、萨县一带农村七千顷以上耕地能够播种，三十多万农民的生活得到保障。
