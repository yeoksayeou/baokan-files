Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 2nd dispatch: The British colonial authorities in Malaya continue to brutally persecute our overseas Chinese compatriots. The British colonial government drafted a plan at the beginning of this year to force hundreds of thousands of Chinese to move into more than 300 specially set up so-called "immigrant camps." This plan is now being accelerated.

On February 19, the British colonial authorities ordered more than 100 Chinese resident households in the Sungei Besi Road, Cheras, Selangor, to move to designated "immigrant camps" within 24 hours. On the morning of the 20th, the British colonial authorities dispatched a large number of military police, disregarding everything to demolish the houses of the compatriots in the area, forcing them to move, and looting all the property of the compatriots. Many compatriots were also severely beaten. In the Da Ba Yang area, more than 1,000 Chinese residents were recently ordered to move to designated "immigrant camps" within two hours, with no items allowed to be carried. The vast number of overseas Chinese who were forced to move were driven into the so-called "immigrant camps" surrounded by barbed wire and full of sentry posts, and lost their freedom. They could only go out to work at 9 am every day and return before 3 pm. Those who left early and returned late, or who were found to be carrying food, would be shot on the spot. In the "immigrant camps," the crops of the compatriots were "collected and sold on their behalf" by the British military police, and sometimes they were all plundered.

The British colonial authorities also continue to create "dead zones" in Malaya. Most of the Chinese villages along the railway lines in Malaya have been burned down, and anyone is forbidden to come and go. A village in the "34th Milestone" area of Singapore, with more than 300 overseas Chinese, has recently been burned to the ground. The Chinese villages of Tieqiao, Dehe, and Xinglin in Johor were also burned down, more than 50 young Chinese were arrested for military service, and women and children were driven into concentration camps. In the San Tiao Shi area of ​​Kluang, Jalan Mersing, the British military police burned down the residences of more than 3,000 Chinese, arrested more than a dozen compatriots, and killed three people. The town of Laiying in Johor has been "sealed off" by the British colonial authorities. Residents are only allowed to come and go and do business within one hour from 10 am to 11 am every day, and violators will be shot.

The British colonial authorities also used the method of "collective punishment" to extort huge "fines" from the vast number of overseas Chinese. Since the announcement of this decree last December, overseas Chinese in Songjia in Kedah, Buxian in Perak, and Songge in Alor Setar have been collectively "fined." The small village of Songge, with only more than 120 Chinese, was fined 3,000 pounds. Shops in the area were also ordered to limit their business hours to no more than one hour per day.

　　马来亚英国殖民当局继续残酷迫害我侨胞        
    数十万侨胞将被迫迁入“移民营”
    【新华社广州二日电】马来亚英国殖民当局继续残暴地迫害我国侨胞。英国殖民政府在今年年初曾拟定计划，要强迫数十万华侨迁移到三百多个特设的所谓“移民营”里。这一计划，最近正加紧实行中。
    二月十九日，英国殖民当局下令雪兰莪州蕉赖路新芭一带的一百多户华侨居民，在二十四小时内全部迁到指定的“移民营”。二十日晨，英国殖民当局竟派出大队军警，不顾一切地拆毁该地侨胞的房屋，强迫他们迁移，并将该地侨胞财物洗劫一空。很多侨胞还受到毒打。在大巴洋地区，华侨居民一千多人最近更被勒令在两小时内迁移到指定的“移民营”，任何东西都不准携带。被迫迁移的广大华侨，被驱入周围设置带刺铁丝网和满布哨岗的所谓“移民营”后，即失去自由，每天只能在上午九时出外工作，下午三时以前回来。早出迟归的和被查出带有粮食的，就会当场被枪杀。在“移民营”里，侨胞的农作物都要由英国军警“收集代卖”，有时全部被掠夺。
    英国殖民当局还继续在马来亚制造“死地”，全马来亚铁路沿线的华侨村庄，大多数已被烧毁，禁绝任何人往来。新加坡“三十四条石”地区一个有三百多名华侨的村庄，最近已被烧为平地。柔佛的铁桥、德和、兴林等华侨村庄也被烧光，有五十多名青年华侨被抓去服兵役，妇孺被驱入集中营。在居銮毛申路的三条石地区，英国军警烧毁了三千多华侨的住区，并捕去侨胞十多人，打死三人。柔佛州赖影镇已被英国殖民当局“禁封”，每日只有上午十时至十一时一小时内准许居民往来和营业，违者都要遭到枪杀。
    英国殖民当局并使用“集体惩罚”的办法，向广大华侨榨取巨额“罚款”。自去年十二月宣布该项法令后，已有吉打的宋甲、霹雳的布先、亚罗士打的宋阁等地华侨被集体“罚款”。仅有一百二十多名华侨的宋阁小村，即被罚款三千英镑。该地商店并被限令每日营业时间不得超过一小时。
