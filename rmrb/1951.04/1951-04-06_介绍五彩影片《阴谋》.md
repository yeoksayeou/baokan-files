Introducing the Color Film "The Conspiracy"
    Translated from Soviet Film
    The film "The Conspiracy" tells the story of the sharp political struggle between the forces of people's democracy and reactionary forces in an Eastern European country that has embarked on a new path of historical development.
    This film vividly exposes the true reasons and intentions of the anti-people conspiracy organized by Wall Street imperialist agents against the fruits of the laboring people's democracy. The film shows the growth and unity of all progressive forces in this country, who, under the leadership of the Communist Party, build a new life despite the desperate resistance of reactionary forces, and finally achieve victory in the struggle against fascist conspirators and their American supporters.
    …In the dense thickets of the swamp, a woman walks with great difficulty. She is wearing the clothes of a concentration camp prisoner, her face is exhausted, and her feet are bare. She hurries forward, often sinking into the mud, slipping, and falling. The sound of dogs barking is heard, the woman listens in alarm, and then continues to run forward. She is quickly obscured by the dense thickets.
    The secret police are chasing her. They have been searching for her for a long time, but they can't find her, so they return.
    At this moment, the woman runs to the home of Kosta Vala, a poor peasant in a nearby village. To prevent the secret police from tracking her down, they hide her, because she is Nanna Likhda—a loyal daughter of the people, a fearless fighter against fascist enslavement. In the concentration camp, she was sentenced to death for her activities, but she escaped.
    At night, with the help of friends, Nanna Likhda sets off for the guerrilla area.
    Years have passed…
    The Soviet army liberated this country from the iron heel of the fascist invaders, opening a new path of development for the country's laboring people. However, agents of U.S. imperialism organized a conspiracy to oppose the laboring people and their vanguard—the Communist Party. Dark forces within the country also participated in this conspiracy. They attempted to seize power from the people, enslave them under the "Marshall Plan," and turn them against the Soviet Union.
    At the unveiling ceremony of the monument to the Soviet soldiers who died for the liberation of the country, Nanna Likhda, who became the Prime Minister, spoke. She explained the difficulties facing the young country and the necessity of fighting against the enemies who attempt to hinder the construction of a new life. She called on everyone to be vigilant.
    At the same time, U.S. Ambassador McHale is busy reporting to the State Department in Washington about the assassination of Nanna Likhda, because he knows that the assassin is waiting for her on the road.
    After the meeting, Nanna returns to the capital by car and is assassinated in the mountains. A group of fascist thugs, dressed as Catholic priests, block the Prime Minister's car and seriously injure Nanna Likhda. Mark Pino passes by and suddenly encounters the seriously injured Nanna, and he rushes her to the home of Kosta Vala, not far from the assassination site.
    The peasants of the nearby village hear that Nanna Likhda has been assassinated and rush to Kosta Vala's house. Nanna's friends, the party leaders, and ministers all come. At the same time, some unexpected guests also arrive, including the Minister of Public Security, the old leader of the Social Democratic Party, Yakim Pino, Bishop Biernyich, and the leader of the National Unity Party, Christina Padella—the real criminals who murdered Nanna. They shed false tears at her bedside, attempting to conceal their crimes.
    The assassination of Nanna Likhda ignited a flame of hatred for the enemies of the people and their accomplices in the hearts of the people, and a wave of popular anger surged throughout the country.
    Mark Pino, an engineer at a tank factory and a left-wing Social Democrat, said angrily: "The assassination of Togliatti, the assassination of Tokuda Kyuichi, the arrest of Foster and Dennis... No, this is not just a conspiracy against the Communist Party and its leaders, it is a conspiracy against the entire democratic camp."
    The conspirators do not stop at the assassination of Nanna Likhda.
    Music is playing in the hall of the American Embassy, and couples are dancing. In the spacious office of U.S. Ambassador McHale, people are sitting around a card table, carrying out a conspiracy to suffocate the young republic: McHale instructs the Minister of Industry, the big capitalist Gugo Vaskis, to create a famine in the country, transport the surplus food to Yugoslavia, and then distribute the food to the starving people through the hands of the Americans.
    ………So the train carrying the grain heads to the border. And the cities are full of hungry queues.
    Nanna Likhda convenes a meeting and instructs everyone to take swift and severe measures against the saboteurs, confiscate the surplus grain from the rich peasants, and ensure the grain supply for the workers.
    The struggle for food has become the determining factor in the country's political life. Fierce struggles unfold at the Congress meeting. The traitors of the people suggest seeking aid from the United States, which means accepting the so-called "Marshall Plan" and enslaving their country.
    Nanna Likhda and the representatives of the Democratic United Front speak out against this proposal and expose the conspiracy of the running dogs of U.S. imperialism. The people gather around the Congress, supporting the demands of their representatives, and the proposal to accept the "Marshall Plan" is rejected.
    According to Nanna Likhda's proposal, the Congress decides to send a delegation to the Soviet Union to sign a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance.
    But the conspirators do not give up. They organize a rebellion, with McHale directing everything from the American Embassy. The direct executors of his plan are Bishop Biernyich and the leader of the National Unity Party, Christina Padella.
    The representatives of the United Front demonstrate vigilance, promptly expose the conspirators' plan, and quickly suppress the rebellion. Biernyich, Christina Padella, and their accomplices are arrested. And McHale, the director of this failed attempt, hurriedly leaves the country in order to continue engaging in aggressive plans against the peaceful democratic camp outside the country.
    The film ends with a grand demonstration of the workers celebrating the signing of the treaty with the great Soviet Union. The Soviet Union extends a brotherly hand of assistance to the people who have embarked on the road to democracy and socialism. The jubilant people swear to the Soviet people and the great leader Comrade Stalin that they will wage an unwavering struggle for peace against the instigators of a new war and defend the sacred friendship with the great Soviet alliance.

　　介绍五彩影片《阴谋》
    苏影　译
    《阴谋》影片的内容，是述说东欧某一个走上了历史发展新道路的国家内，人民民主力量和反动势力间所展开的尖锐的政治斗争。
    这部影片生动地揭露华尔街帝国主义特务们组织的，反对劳动人民民主果实的反人民阴谋的真实原因和意图。影片显示了这个国家一切进步力量的增长和团结，这些力量不顾反动势力绝望的反抗，在共产党领导之下，建设新的生活，并在反对法西斯阴谋者及其美国支持者的斗争中，终于取得了胜利。
    ……在沼泽地上的茂密树丛中，一个女人很费力地走着。她穿着集中营囚犯的衣服，脸色疲惫不堪，赤着脚。她匆忙地前进，时常陷在泥泞中，滑跤，跌倒。传来狗吠声，妇人惊悸地倾听一下，又继续向前跑去。她很快地被繁茂的树丛遮掩不见了。
    秘密警察在追逐着她。他们追寻了很久，怎样也找不到她，便回去了。
    就在这时候，这个女人跑到附近村子的贫农——可斯他·瓦拉的家中。为了防备秘密警察的追踪，他们把她藏匿起来，因为她是那干娜·李赫达——人民的忠实女儿，无畏的反法西斯奴役者的战士。在集中营里，她因为自己的活动被判了死刑，但她逃了出来。
    夜里，在朋友们的帮助下，干娜·李赫达出发到游击区去。
    经过了数年………。
    苏联的军队把这个国家从法西斯侵略者铁蹄下解放了出来，为该国的劳动人民打开了一条新的发展道路。但是，美帝国主义的代理人组织了一个阴谋，来反对劳动人民和他们的先锋队——共产党。这个国家内部的黑暗势力也参与了这个阴谋。他们企图把权力从人民手里夺去，把它奴役在“马歇尔计划”之下，并且使它转身反对苏联。
    在举行为解放该国而阵亡的苏军战士纪念碑揭幕典礼时，当了国务总理的干娜·李赫达讲话。她说明年青的国家所面对的困难，以及对企图妨害建设新生活的敌人斗争的必要性。她号召大家提高警惕。
    与此同时，美国大使麦克黑尔正忙着向华盛顿国务院报告干娜·李赫达被刺，因为他知道刺客在路上等着她。
    会后，干娜乘车回首都，在山地里遇刺。一群法西斯暴徒们，穿着天主教神父的衣服，阻拦国务总理的车子，并且重伤干娜·李赫达。马尔克·皮诺从这里经过，突遇重伤的干娜，他急忙送她到离着遇刺地点不远的可斯他·瓦拉家中。
    附近村子的农民听说干娜·李赫达被刺，纷纷跑到可斯他·瓦拉家里。干娜的朋友，党的领导者们，部长们都来了。同时，也来了些意外的客人，其中有公安部部长、社会民主党的老首领岳西姆·皮诺，毕尔恩赤主教，民族统一党领袖赫里斯奇娜·帕代拉——这些谋杀干娜的真正罪犯。他们在她的床前流着虚伪的眼泪，企图掩藏他们的罪恶行径。
    干娜·李赫达的被刺，在人民的心里燃起了仇恨人民公敌及其帮凶的火焰，人民愤怒的浪潮澎湃全国。
    坦克车工厂工程师，左翼社会民主党员马尔克·皮诺愤怒地说：“刺杀托里亚蒂，刺杀德田球一，逮捕福斯特和但尼斯……不，这不仅是反对共产党及其领袖的阴谋，这是反对整个民主阵营的阴谋。”
    阴谋者们并不止于对干娜·李赫达的暗害。
    音乐在美国大使馆的大厅中响着，一对一对的男女在跳着舞。而在美国大使麦克·黑尔底宽大的办公室里，有人围着打牌的桌子，正在进行着窒息年青共和国的阴谋：麦克·黑尔给工业部部长、大资本家谷高·瓦斯奇斯下指示，在国内制造饥荒，把剩余的食粮运往南斯拉夫，然后经过美国人的手把这些粮食发给这些饥饿的人民。
    ………于是载着粮食的列车驶向国境。而城市中到处是饥饿的行列。
    干娜·李赫达召集会议，指示大家对于破坏者必需采取迅速和严厉的手段，剥夺富农的余粮，并保证工人的粮食。
    为粮食的斗争已成为国内政治生活的决定因素。在国会的会议上展开了激烈的斗争。人民的叛徒们建议向美国求援，就是说要接受所谓“马歇尔计划”，使自己国家被奴役。
    干娜·李赫达和民主统一战线的代表们发言反对这个建议，并揭穿美帝国主义走狗们的阴谋。人民群集在国会周围，支持自己的代表们的要求，接受“马歇尔计划”的提议被打消了。
    按照着干娜·李赫达的提议，国会决定派遣代表团到苏联，去签订友好互助条约。
    但是阴谋者们并不干休，他们组织叛乱，由麦克·黑尔从美国大使馆指挥一切。他的计划的直接执行者是毕尔恩赤主教及民族统一党领袖赫里斯奇娜·帕代拉。
    统一战线的代表们表现出警惕性，及时地揭发了阴谋家的计划，迅速镇压了叛乱。毕尔恩赤，赫里斯奇娜·帕代拉和他们的帮手们被逮捕了。而这个失败企图的指挥者麦克·黑尔，匆匆离开了这个国家，以便在国境外继续从事反对和平民主阵营的侵略计划。
    影片以劳动者庆祝与伟大苏联签定条约的盛大示威游行做结束。苏联向走上民主和社会主义道路的人民伸出兄弟般援助的手。狂欢的人民向苏联人民及伟大的人民领袖斯大林同志发出誓言，要为争取和平反对新战争的煽动者做不屈不挠的斗争，保卫与伟大苏维埃盟邦的神圣友谊。
