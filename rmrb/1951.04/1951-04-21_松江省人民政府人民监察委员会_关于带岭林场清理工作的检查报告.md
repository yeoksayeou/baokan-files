Reaction to criticisms and suggestions from People's Daily readers

	The People's Supervision Committee of the Songjiang Provincial People's Government
	Inspection Report on the Cleanup Work of Dailing Forestry Farm
	The People's Daily published a letter on March 7th from comrades Lü Yunchang and two others criticizing the Songjiang Dailing Experimental Forestry Farm for indiscriminate logging, which resulted in damage to the trees. The People's Supervision Committee of the Songjiang Provincial People's Government, together with representatives from the Songjiang Daily, the Forest Industry Bureau of the Northeast People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Forest Administration Bureau, and the Forest Administration Office of the Songjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, formed an investigation team and conducted an on-site inspection of the Dailing Forestry Farm. The results of the inspection are reported as follows.
	Forest Farm Cleanup Process: The Dailing Experimental Forestry Farm began the forest farm cleanup work on November 24, 1950. Before the workers went up the mountain, the heads of each team and the technical staff jointly demarcated the cleanup area. Then, contracts were signed with the masses participating in the work, stipulating that the cleanup should be completed by the end of February. Before the start of operations, the forestry farm's technical staff gathered the heads of each team and the workers pulling the logs to carry out pilot work. Work was stopped due to the discovery of indiscriminate felling of good trees, and a half-day meeting was held to correct this phenomenon. However, due to the lack of specific management methods, the phenomenon of felling good trees in the forests on both sides of the river continued to occur. On February 24th of this year, comrades from the Dailing Forest Industry Bureau suggested that trees along the riverbanks should not be felled. The Dailing Forestry Farm immediately stopped all felling the next day.
	In this cleanup area of ​​500 hectares, a total of 7,448 cubic meters of timber were cleared. After our inspection, approximately 900 cubic meters of good trees were mistakenly felled.
	The reasons for the above shortcomings are: (1) The leadership of the Dailing Forestry Farm did not study the regulations of the Northeast Forest Administration Bureau on cleaning up forestry farms in detail and implement them among the masses. (2) The inspection work was not thorough enough, leading to errors that were not corrected in a timely manner. (3) Technical guidance and leadership were weak. In the 500-hectare cleanup area, there were only three staff members and one technician, so comprehensive care was insufficient. (4) The management methods were not scientific enough, which resulted in the wrong felling of some good trees and the waste of some materials. (5) The cleanup time was short, and the workers were eager to pull the timber out, so the treetop wood was not cleared out in time.
	Accountability: Liu Xiquan, director of the Dailing Forestry Farm, was complacent, did not study the instructions from higher authorities very well, and his work was not thorough enough, causing undue losses to state property. This dereliction of duty should be severely punished; however, because there were few actual on-site staff and insufficient cleanup time, and corrections were made after the errors were discovered, it was decided to give an administrative demerit of a major offense.

### 松江省人民政府人民监察委员会  关于带岭林场清理工作的检查报告

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　松江省人民政府人民监察委员会
    关于带岭林场清理工作的检查报告
    人民日报于三月七日发表了吕运昌等三同志批评松江带岭试验林场采伐无方，林木因而受到摧残的信件。松江省人民政府人民监察委员会即会同松江日报社、东北人民政府农林部森林工业总局、林政局、松江省农林厅林政处等单位代表，组成调查组，到带岭林场作实际检查。现将检查结果报告如下。
    清理林场经过：带岭试验林场于一九五○年十一月二十四日开始清理林场的工作。在工人未上山以前，曾由各队负责人及技术人员一起到山上划定清理区域。然后就和参加工作的群众签定合同，规定到二月底清理完毕。开始作业前，林场技术人员曾把各队负责人及拉杆的工人集合起来进行试点工作，并因发现了滥伐好树的事情停止工作，开过半天会纠正了这种现象。但是，因为缺乏具体的管理方法，在河边两岸的森林中伐好树的现象仍然继续发生。今年二月二十四日，经带岭森林工业局的同志提出意见认为河边沿岸树木不应采伐。带岭林场次日即全部停止采伐。
    在此次五百垧清理面积中，共清理出木材七千四百四十八立方米。经我们检查，其中误伐的好树共约九百立方米。
    产生以上缺点原因是由于：（一）带岭林场领导上对东北林政局的清理林场规定，没有详细研究并具体贯彻到群众中去。（二）检查工作不够深入，以致发生了错误，未能及时纠正。（三）技术指导力量与领导力量薄弱，在五百垧的清理面积中，只有三个工作人员和一个技术人员，因此全面照顾不够。（四）经营管理方法上不够科学，因此使部分好树被错伐，部分材料被浪费。（五）清理时间较短，工人急于往外拉木材，以致梢头木未能及时清理出场。
    对责任的追究：带岭林场主任刘喜权有自满情绪，对上级指示不很好研究，工作不够深入，造成国家财产不应有的损失。这种失职行为应受到严格处分；但因现场实际工作人员较少，清理时间不足，发现错误后即进行了纠正，所以行政上决定给予记大过一次的处分。
