　　Promote Patriotism, Oppose Colonial Mentality Among Businessmen!
　　Qian Jiaju
　　For nearly a hundred years, under the long-term aggression of imperialism in China, on the one hand, it aroused the unyielding struggle of Chinese workers and peasants, and on the other hand, it cultivated a very strong colonial mentality among comprador bourgeoisie and some industrialists and businessmen. The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the Chinese People's Revolution has declared the end of imperialist rule in China, but this colonial mentality of worshiping foreigners, belittling the motherland, and underestimating oneself has not been fundamentally eliminated. Due to this blatant aggression against China and Korea by American imperialism, an unprecedented great movement to resist America and aid Korea has been launched in our country. Under the call of Chairman Mao to promote patriotism, patriotic ideological education movements have been launched in various places, and accusation meetings have been held to resolutely eliminate the colonial mentality caused by the cultural and educational aggression of American imperialism. In the cultural field, we have finally made a thorough reckoning of the cultural aggression that imperialism has carried out against us for nearly a hundred years. However, in the business community, this residual colonial mentality still exists seriously. How is this proven? First of all, it is reflected in trademarks. Obviously, the goods are manufactured by Chinese manufacturers themselves, and the target customers are the Chinese people, but they prefer to imitate a foreign trademark and pretend to be foreign goods. Or use Western characters on trademarks, instructions, packaging paper, and pamphlets, without even a single Chinese character. Is it that they hope that this trademark or pamphlet will have a publicity effect? No, because everyone knows that the number of Chinese people who understand Western languages ​​is many times smaller than those who understand Chinese characters. If the trademark or packaging hopes to have a publicity effect, it should use Chinese characters that are familiar to the vast majority of people. Obviously, their purpose in using foreign languages ​​is nothing more than to imply imported goods and deceive customers. This bad practice is most common in cigarettes and cosmetics. Often the entire package is full of English, and not a single Chinese character can be found. At first glance, it is thought to be genuine imported goods, but it is clearly printed with the English words "Made in China." Even worse, it is simply pretending to be foreign goods, affixing a trademark that is exactly the same as foreign goods. For example, brandy is obviously made in China, but it is affixed with a French-made three-star trademark. There was also a certain medicine from a pharmaceutical factory run by the late Shanghai gangster Huang, called "Airo ×××." In fact, "Airo" is the transliteration of Huang (Yellow). Examples like this are everywhere. Naturally, there are social roots for businessmen to imply foreign trademarks or use foreign languages. His purpose is nothing more than to deceive customers and cater to customers' psychology of worshiping foreign goods. Therefore, customers are also half responsible for this phenomenon. We do not deny that due to the backwardness of China's industrial development, some domestic products are not as good as foreign products in terms of quality. This is the result of long-term economic aggression by imperialism. Chinese crafts have always been at the forefront of world culture for thousands of years, and only in the past one or two hundred years have they fallen behind Europeans. In the new China after the complete elimination of imperialism and feudalism, the prospects for my country's economic development are limitless. In the future, if we want to improve the quality of Chinese products, we must first develop a psychology of loving domestic products, and the development of a psychology of loving domestic products should first thoroughly eliminate the colonial mentality of worshiping foreign goods in the past.
　　Imitating foreign trademarks or using foreign languages ​​on trademarks (except for export commodities) is undoubtedly a manifestation of colonial mentality. Two years after the national liberation and the overthrow of imperialist rule in China, it cannot but be our shame that the Chinese market is still filled with commodities that use foreign languages ​​and pretend to be foreign goods. In order to promote patriotic education, we should launch a struggle against this colonial mentality of businessmen. In the Provisional Regulations on Trademark Registration (Article 4), the use of foreign languages ​​as trademarks was originally prohibited. Since the Central Private Enterprise Bureau has been handling trademark registration work, all trademarks using foreign languages ​​(except for commodities sold abroad or imported from foreign countries) are not allowed to be registered, and even trademarks using Western letters must be corrected. However, whether or not to register a trademark is voluntary (a trademark that is not registered only does not protect its exclusive right); therefore, some unregistered trademarks use Western languages ​​and are still full of eyes. According to regulations, the government does not interfere with whether or not a trademark is registered, but if an unregistered trademark violates the provisions of Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations on Trademark Registration (according to Article 4: certain texts and graphics shall not be applied for registration as trademarks, such as national flags, national emblems, military flags, etc., and foreign languages ​​are also prohibited), local industrial and commercial administrative organs still have the right to ban it. However, in the past, local industrial and commercial administrative organs were busy dealing with other affairs and did not strictly implement this work. Recently, the Beijing Municipal People's Government issued a notice banning the use of foreign languages ​​in trademarks and signboards. The main contents of the regulations are: "1. No matter what kind of stores are operated by Chinese or foreigners, the signboards and decorations should all use Chinese and no foreign languages ​​should be used anymore. 2. The original plaques on the facades of industrial and commercial households that use foreign languages ​​attached to fixed buildings shall be dismantled and corrected within six months from the date of the announcement; new facades shall not use foreign languages; those that are not attached to fixed buildings shall be removed or painted over immediately. 3. Existing packaging paper, boxes, invoices, pamphlets, etc. printed with foreign languages ​​should all be registered with the Industrial and Commercial Bureau for the quantity, and self-stamped with correction stamps or painted over until they are used up. 4. Trademarks for which re-registration is applied for shall not use foreign languages ​​except for commodities sold abroad, but in order to take care of the manufacturers, all trademarks originally using foreign languages ​​shall be temporarily exclusively used for two years from the date of issuance of the certificate. 5. If the names of Western medicines are commonly translated, the translated names should be used; if the translated names are inconsistent, the original text may be attached and both Chinese and foreign languages ​​may be used; if there is no translated name, the original text may still be used."
　　We believe that this measure of the Beijing Municipal People's Government is appropriate, and the people's governments of various places can consider the actual situation in various places and take similar or the same measures. In trademark work, the Central Private Enterprise Bureau is also prepared to ban trademarks in foreign languages ​​nationwide (except for those who are allowed to use them according to the law), regardless of whether the trademark is registered or not (registered trademarks have been banned, which is not a problem). At the same time, we hope that manufacturers and industrialists and businessmen in various places will automatically and consciously implement this work, cooperate with the call of patriotic education, and thoroughly eliminate the residual colonial mentality in the industrial and commercial circles. At the same time, this will also cultivate our psychology of loving domestic products, which is of great benefit to the development of China's private industry and commerce.

　　发扬爱国主义，反对商人中的殖民地思想！
　　千家驹
    近百年来，中国在帝国主义长期侵略之下，一方面激起了中国工人农民不屈不挠的斗争，另方面却养成了买办资产阶级以及一部分工商业家极浓厚的殖民地思想。中国人民解放战争和中国人民革命的胜利，已使帝国主义在中国的统治宣告结束，但这种崇拜洋人轻视祖国妄自菲薄的殖民地思想并没有根本肃清。由于这一次美帝国主义对中国和朝鲜露骨的侵略，掀起了我国空前伟大的抗美援朝运动，在毛主席发扬爱国主义的号召下，在各地展开了爱国主义思想教育运动，举行了控诉大会，坚决地肃清美帝国主义文化侵略教育侵略所造成的殖民地思想。在文化领域上，我们总算把近百年来帝国主义对我们的文化侵略作了一次彻底的清算。但在商人中，这种残余的殖民地思想却依然严重地存在着。这从那些方面得到证明呢？首先，就表现在商标上，明明是中国厂商自己制造的商品，顾客对象亦是中国人民大众，但他们却偏喜欢仿造一个外商的商标，冒充洋货。或者在商标上，说明上，包装纸以及仿单上使用西文，甚至连一个中国字也没有。是不是他们希望这种商标或仿单发生宣传的作用呢？不是的，因为谁也知道，中国人懂得西文的比懂中国文字的人不知道要少好多倍，如果商标或包装希望发生宣传作用的话，他应该用为最大多数人民所熟悉的中国文字才对。显然的，他们所以使用外文，其目的不外是影射舶来品，欺蒙顾客而已。这种恶劣的作风，尤以卷烟与化装用品上为最普遍，常见整个包装上满是英文，连一个中国字也找不到，乍一看，还以为是道地的舶来品，但上面明明地印着“中国制造”的英文字（Ｍade in Ｃhina）。更甚者，是根本冒充外货，贴上一个与外国货一模一样的商标。例如白兰地酒明明是中国自制的，偏要贴着法国制造的三星商标。还有已故上海流氓头子黄某制药厂的某种成药，叫做“艾罗氏×××”，其实“艾罗氏”者，黄（Ｙellow）之译音也。诸如此类的例子，俯拾皆是。自然，商人之所以要影射外国商标，或者使用外文，是有他的社会根源的。他的目的，无非是要蒙蔽顾客，迎合顾客崇拜洋货的心理。所以这种现象，顾客也是要负一半责任的。我们并不否认由于中国产业发展的落后，某些国货在品质上不及外货优良，这是事实。但这正是帝国主义长期经济侵略的结果。中国的工艺制品在几千年来经常居于世界文化的前列，只有在近一二百年来，才落于欧洲人之后。在彻底消灭了帝国主义封建主义后的新中国，我国经济发展的前途是无可限量的，今后我们要提高中国产品的品质，必须首先养成大家爱用国货的心理，而爱用国货心理的养成，首先应该彻底肃清过去那种崇拜洋货的殖民地思想。
    模仿外商商标或商标上使用外文（除出口商品外），无疑地是殖民地思想的表现。在全国解放，推翻了帝国主义在中国的统治二年之后，在我国商场上还充斥着这种使用洋文，冒充洋货的商品，不能不说是我们的耻辱。为了发扬爱国主义教育，我们应该展开反对商人这种殖民地思想的斗争。在商标注册暂行条例上（第四条），对于使用外国文字为商标本在禁止之列。自中央私营企业局办理商标注册工作以来，凡使用外国文字的商标（除运销国外或由外国进口的商品外）一律不准注册，甚至用西文字母为商标的，亦必令其更正。但商标注册与否，是听其自愿的（不注册的商标仅不保护其专用权）；所以一些不注册的商标使用西文，依然满目皆是，按照规定，商标注册与否，政府虽不加以干涉，但如果不注册的商标，有违反商标注册暂行条例第四条各款之规定时（按第四条规定：某些文字图形，不得作为商标申请注册，例如国旗、国徽、军旗等等，外国文字亦在禁止之列），各地工商行政机关仍有权加以取缔。但过去各地工商行政机关因忙于处理其他事务，对于这一工作并没有严格地执行。最近北京市人民政府发布了一个布告，取缔商标及招牌等使用外国文字。其中规定的主要内容是：“一、不论中外人所经营的商店，招牌及装璜上，应一律使用中文，不得再用外国文字。二、各工商业户门面牌匾原用外国文字附着于固定建筑物者，限自布告之日起，于六个月内一律拆修改正；新建门面，不得再用外文；其非附着于固定建筑物者应即撤除或涂改。三、旧存印有外文的包装纸、盒、发票、仿单等，应一律向工商局登记数量，自行加盖改正戳记或涂改，至用完为止。四、重新申请注册的商标，除运销国外的商品外，不得再用外国文字，但为照顾厂商起见，凡原用外国文字之商标，准自发证之日起，暂行专用二年。五、西药名称如通行译名者应用译名；译名不一致者，可附原文，中外文并用，无译名者，可仍用原文”。
    北京人民政府这一措施，我们认为是恰当的，各地人民政府很可以斟酌各地实际情形，采取类似的或同一的措施。在商标工作上，中央私营企业局也准备在全国范围内取缔以外国文字为商标（除依法律规定准其使用者外），不论这种商标是不是注册的（注册的已经取缔，不成问题）。同时我们更希望各地厂商，工商业家自动自觉地来执行这一工作，配合着爱国主义教育的号召，彻底肃清工商业界残余的殖民地思想。同时这样也就培养了我们爱用国货的心理，对于中国私营工商业的发展上也是有莫大好处的。
