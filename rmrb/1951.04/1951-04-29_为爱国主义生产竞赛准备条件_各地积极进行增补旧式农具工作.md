　　Preparing Conditions for the Patriotic Production Emulation Drive
　  Various Regions Actively Carry Out the Work of Supplementing Old-fashioned Farm Tools
    Several regions across the country are actively carrying out the work of supplementing old-fashioned farm tools, preparing conditions for the patriotic production emulation drive that is being widely launched in various places. According to a report from the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Rehe Province, blacksmith shops, both public and private, are being widely organized throughout the province to manufacture old-fashioned farm tools. Qinglong County has added 14,258 new plowshares, Chaoyang has newly added 350 weeders, and Chifeng has newly manufactured a total of 69,000 hoes, shovels, and plowshares. According to statistics from cooperatives in fifty counties, 94,909 farm tools have been prepared. The Anyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Pingyuan Province held a symposium for handicraft workers and a symposium for preparing farm tools, bringing together producers, consumers, and supply and marketing cooperatives to sign contracts for ordering farm tools. A total of 341 contracts were approved at the meeting, ordering a total of 10,615 farm tools. The Prefectural Commissioner's Office is also preparing to promote the formulation of plans for supplementing old farm tools by groups, households, and villages in various counties, in order to carry out the production emulation drive on the basis of realizing the plans. Local governments in Jinhua, Zhejiang, Shaoyang, Hunan, and Changchun, Northeast China, are all cooperating with cooperatives, trading companies, and trust companies to carry out the work of supplementing farm tools. Banks in various places have promptly issued loans to solve the problem of funding difficulties. In addition, in Chengde, Northeast China, Qixian, Pingyuan Province, and other places, many farmers have spontaneously organized carpenters and blacksmiths to go to the countryside to repair and manufacture farm tools.
    However, the work of repairing farm tools in some areas has not yet been carried out very well, specifically manifested in the fact that loans for old-fashioned farm tools have not been issued to areas lacking farm tools where the promotion of new-style farm tools is insufficient, and therefore cannot meet the urgent needs of farmers for farm tools. For example, Haiyang County, Shandong Province, used loans for old farm tools to purchase 30 new-style walking plows, and Hengshui County, Hebei Province, plans to use all the loans for old-fashioned farm tools for new-style farm tools. Similar phenomena have also occurred in Weishi and Taikang counties in Henan Province.
    In order to complete the task of supplementing more than 10 million old-fashioned farm tools this year and to correct the bias of some areas that cannot correctly use loans for old-fashioned farm tools, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has sent personnel to Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi and other provinces to inspect the work. It has also sent personnel to the Yellow River flood area in Henan and the disaster area in northern Jiangsu to conduct key inspections and assist local areas in carrying out the work of supplementing old-fashioned farm tools. The Ministry has also studied specific methods for supplementing farm tools with the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, so that agricultural and forestry institutions at all levels can cooperate closely with cooperatives at all levels to carry out this work. The All-China Federation of Cooperatives has now issued instructions requiring cooperatives in various places to vigorously carry out the work of supplementing farm tools through their own business.

### 为爱国主义生产竞赛准备条件  各地积极进行增补旧式农具工作

　　为爱国主义生产竞赛准备条件
　  各地积极进行增补旧式农具工作
    全国若干地区积极进行旧式农具的增补工作，为正在各地普遍展开的爱国主义生产竞赛运动准备条件。据热河省农林厅通报，全省各地正在普遍组织公私营铁匠炉制造旧式农具。青龙县已添新铧一万四千二百五十八件，朝阳新添耘锄三百五十台，赤峰新造锄、锨、铧子共六万九千件。据五十个县的合作社统计，已制备农具九万四千九百零九件。平原省安阳专署，曾召开手工业者座谈会和准备农具座谈会，使生产、消费、供销社三者见面，订立订购农具合同。会上计通过合同三百四十一件，共订购农具一万零六百十五件。该专署并准备推动各县按组、按户、按村订立增补旧农具计划，以便在实现计划的基础上，开展生产竞赛运动。浙江金华、湖南邵阳、东北长春等地人民政府均与合作社、贸易公司、信托公司配合进行农具增补工作。各地银行已及时发放贷款，解决资金困难问题。此外，东北承德、平原淇县等地，许多农民已自动组织铁木匠下乡，修制农具。
    但目前有些地区的农具修补工作还没有很好的开展起来，具体表现在没有将旧式农具贷款发放到农具缺乏而新式农具推广力量不及的地区，因而不能满足农民对农具的迫切需要。如山东海阳县利用旧农具贷款，购买了三十台新式步犁，河北衡水县准备将旧式农具贷款全部用于新式农具，唐山县以一亿多旧式农具贷款买了新犁。河南尉氏、太康两县亦有类似现象发生。
    中央人民政府农业部为了完成本年增补旧农具一千万件以上的任务，及纠正某些地区不能正确运用旧式农具贷款的偏向，曾派员分赴河北、山东、山西等省检查工作。并已派员分赴河南黄汛区，苏北灾区进行重点检查，协助当地开展旧式农具增补工作。该部并已与全国合作总社研究增补农具的具体办法，俾使各级农林机构与各级合作社密切合作，开展这一工作。现全国合作总社已发布指示，要求各地合作社通过本身业务大力开展增补农具的工作。
