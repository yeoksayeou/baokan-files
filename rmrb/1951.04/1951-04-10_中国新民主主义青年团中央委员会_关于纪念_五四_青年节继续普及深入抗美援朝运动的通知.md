　　China New Democratic Youth League Central Committee
　  Notice on Commemorating "May Fourth" Youth Day and Continuing to Popularize and Deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
    "May Fourth" Youth Day, which is also the second anniversary of the birth of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, is approaching. This year's "May Fourth" comes at a time when the Chinese people's Resist America, Aid Korea movement has achieved great victories and the people of the world are at the height of defending peace. The youth of the whole country must unite with the people of the whole country, inherit and carry forward the patriotic spirit of the "May Fourth" movement against imperialism, continue to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, oppose American imperialism's arming of Japan, and defend peace in the Far East and the world.
    Youth League committees in all regions should unite with other youth organizations to unite the broad masses of young people and use the following methods to continue to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement to commemorate this year's "May Fourth."
    (1) Implement the March 14th Circular and the April 5th Notice of the China People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association. Before May 1st, vigorously popularize the propaganda work of Resist America, Aid Korea. In late April, coordinate with various people's organizations to convene mass gatherings of various sizes. At these meetings, expose the crimes of aggression committed by Japanese and American imperialism and the crimes committed by counter-revolutionary elements against the people, sign petitions to support the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, and hold votes on the Japanese issue. In areas where patriotic pacts have not been signed, work to sign patriotic pacts can also be carried out at the same time. This work should also be linked to the specific tasks of young people in various regions. Youth League members should systematically and actively carry out propaganda work to the masses in urban and rural areas, paying special attention to blank areas, areas with weak work, and housewives.
    (2) Mobilize young people to actively participate in the "May Day" demonstrations and parades held in various regions. Youth League members in factories and mines should actively respond to the calls in the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' notice commemorating "May Day." Youth League members must thoroughly publicize the significance of the demonstrations and parades to the masses participating in the demonstrations. The effect of the demonstrations should be mainly judged by whether the masses can understand their meaning. Youth League members should first learn the national anthem ("March of the Volunteers"), the song of the Chinese People's Volunteers (i.e., "Defeat the American Wolf Ambition"), and "The Internationale," which will be sung during the "May Day" parade. They should also learn "The People of the World Unite Closely" and "The Song Against Arming Japan" as much as possible, and help the masses learn the above five songs as much as possible so that they can sing during the parade.
    (3) Various regions can hold "May Fourth" commemorative meetings, seminars, patriotic evening parties, and garden parties for young people on "May Fourth." Regions with conditions can also hold exhibitions and sports meets commemorating "May Fourth" and Resist America, Aid Korea. In mass gatherings such as "May Fourth" commemorative meetings and seminars, discussions should be conducted based on the spirit of the Central Committee of the Youth League's "May Fourth" commemorative slogan and the "May Fourth" editorial of the China Youth Daily, combined with the actual situation of young people's ideological life in the local area.
    (4) Every Youth League member should do a patriotic social work to commemorate "May Fourth"; such as publicizing and leading several people to participate in signing the peace pact, going door-to-door to three to five households to publicize, teaching several young people to sing the songs of the parade, or participating in a voluntary labor.
    (5) Youth League committees at all levels must formulate a plan for popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement in 1951 based on the actual situation. Youth League committees at all levels should establish a system in which Youth League committees at all levels regularly report to the youth masses around "May Fourth," and conduct planned and in-depth ideological education on Resist America, Aid Korea to the masses, such as holding regular lectures or regularly giving speeches and reports in various districts, or forming propaganda teams and mobile exhibition teams in conjunction with literary and art work teams to carry out more in-depth publicity. At the same time, they must systematically assist the Communist Party committees at all levels in establishing a propaganda network.

　　中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
　  关于纪念“五四”青年节继续普及深入抗美援朝运动的通知
    “五四”青年节，同时又是中国新民主主义青年团诞生的第二周年纪念日来到了。今年的“五四”正处在中国人民抗美援朝运动获得伟大的胜利和全世界人民保卫和平的高潮当中。全国青年一定要和全国人民在一起，继承并发扬“五四”反对帝国主义的爱国精神，继续普及深入抗美援朝运动，反对美帝国主义武装日本，保卫远东与世界和平。
    各地团委应和其它青年团体，团结广大青年，以下列各项办法继续普及深入抗美援朝运动以纪念今年的“五四”。
    （一）贯彻执行中国人民抗美援朝总会三月十四日的通告以及四月五日的通知，在五月一日以前，大力普及抗美援朝宣传工作，在四月下旬协同各人民团体召集各种群众的大小集会，在这些会上控诉日本和美国帝国主义的侵略罪行及反革命分子残害人民的罪行，签名拥护缔结五国和平公约，举行关于日本问题的投票。没有签订过爱国公约的地区，并可同时进行签订爱国公约的工作。这些工作应同时联系到各地青年的具体任务。青年团员应有计划地积极向城乡群众作好宣传工作，特别注意空白区、工作薄弱的地区及家庭妇女等。
    （二）发动青年群众积极参加各地举行的“五一”示威游行。工矿中的青年团员应积极响应中华全国总工会纪念“五一”通知中的各项号召。青年团员必须向参加示威游行的群众，深入宣传示威游行的意义。示威游行的效果，主要应以群众能否明了其意义为标准。青年团员应首先学会“五一”游行时要唱的国歌（义勇军进行曲）、中国人民志愿军战歌（即《打败美国野心狼》）及《国际歌》，还要尽可能学会《全世界人民团结紧》和《反对武装日本歌》，并帮助群众尽可能学会上述五个歌曲，以便游行时歌唱。
    （三）各地可在“五四”召开青年群众的“五四”纪念会、座谈会、爱国晚会、游园会，有条件的地区并可举办纪念“五四”与抗美援朝的展览会、体育大会。在举行“五四”纪念会、座谈会等群众集会中，应根据团中央“五四”纪念口号、中国青年报“五四”社论的精神，结合当地青年思想生活实际情况，进行讨论。
    （四）每一青年团员为了纪念“五四”，应做好一件爱国主义的社会工作；如宣传并带动几个人参加拥护和平公约的签名，向三户到五户居民挨户宣传，教几个青年唱会游行的歌曲，或参加一次义务劳动等。
    （五）各级团委须根据实际情况制定一九五一年的普及深入抗美援朝爱国运动的计划。各级团委应在“五四”前后，把由各级团委经常向青年群众作报告的制度确立起来，向群众进行有计划地深入抗美援朝的思想教育，如举办定期的讲座或经常到各区进行讲演报告，或结合文艺工作队组成宣传队、巡回展览队，进行更深入地宣传。同时须有计划地协助共产党各级党委把宣传网建立起来。
