　　Beijing, April 22nd – Over ten thousand Catholics in Beijing held a grand demonstration and parade today in support of the Five-Power Peace Pact and against the US rearmament of Japan. Participants included over 10,000 Catholics from 49 units, including Catholic churches, major and secondary schools, and convents, accounting for about one-third of the city's more than 30,000 Catholics. This was an unprecedented patriotic display by Catholics in Beijing. He Chengxiang, Director of the Religious Affairs Department of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government's State Council, Wu Han, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Anti-US and Aid-Korea Branch, Secretary-General Li Leguang, and Xue Chengye, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Culture and Education, attended to provide guidance. Daru, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Buddhist Community's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression, was also invited to participate.

　　At noon, Catholics from various units gathered in front of the Taihe Gate, and the demonstration rally began with the solemn national anthem. Chairman Liu Fudong delivered the opening speech, saying: "American imperialism has forcibly occupied our country's territory of Taiwan, launched the war of aggression against Korea, and is now cruelly slaughtering the Korean people and indiscriminately bombing our peaceful residents. It is also plotting a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan. We patriotic Catholics can no longer tolerate this. Our hearts are burning with the flames of anger. The more than 30,000 Catholics in Beijing must unite closely, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, to expand and deepen the Anti-US and Aid-Korea movement, resolutely oppose the US rearmament of Japan, and especially thoroughly eliminate the imperialist elements lurking within the Catholic Church, safeguard the security of the people's motherland, and defeat all aggressive and provocative acts of American imperialism." Following him, speeches were given by Zhu Fuxiang and Hou Jingyi, Vice Chairmen of the Beijing Catholic Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression. Zhu Fuxiang said: "The patriotic demonstration and parade we are holding today marks our Catholic determination to fight against imperialism. It is undeniable that in the past, our fellow Catholics have not been active or concrete enough in patriotic actions. But today, we want to tell friends all over China, Asia, and the world that Catholics in Beijing have awakened and are taking action. We will certainly bravely and resolutely stand with you in the future and strive for the construction of our motherland and the defense of lasting world peace." Hou Jingyi said: "The patriotic demonstration and parade held by us Catholics today lays the foundation for actively carrying out the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement in the future. We must not only sever ties with imperialism in form, but also in thought and action."

　　Wu Han, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Anti-US and Aid-Korea Branch, and others were invited to speak. Wu Han especially emphasized: "When Catholics actively participate in the patriotic movement, they must be doubly vigilant against the plots and tricks of imperialism, and eliminate the imperialist elements to wash away the stains and bad influences they have caused to the Catholic Church. I believe that, with the exception of a very small number of Catholic dregs who are willing to be used by imperialism, the vast majority of good and patriotic Catholics will be more active in promoting the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement in the future. The people of the whole country warmly welcome and fully support your patriotic actions." He Chengxiang, Director of the Religious Affairs Department of the State Council's Cultural and Educational Committee, repeatedly emphasized in his speech that in order to actively participate in the patriotic movement, Catholics must resolutely sever relations with imperialism, eliminate the influence of imperialism, and remove the imperialist elements who practice cultural aggression under the guise of religion. And the most effective way to do this well is to hold accusation meetings. Because through accusation meetings, we can expose the various crimes of imperialism in using religion to invade our country, raise the political consciousness of the broad masses of Catholics, clearly draw the line, distinguish between enemies and friends, and achieve the purpose of expelling imperialist elements and reactionary elements colluding with them. Director He also used the practical example of the meeting convened by the Religious Affairs Department a few days ago to handle Christian groups accepting American subsidies to illustrate that the accusation meeting played a great role in raising the political awareness of the representatives of various Christian groups attending the meeting, thus making the meeting a great success. He hoped that after the demonstration parade, Catholics in Beijing would, like Catholics in Tianjin, mobilize the masses of Catholics to hold various forms of accusation meetings, and through concrete facts, launch anti-American and patriotic education among the broad masses of Catholics, so as to expand and deepen the patriotic movement of Catholics.

　　After representatives of Catholics such as Song Jingshan spoke successively at the meeting, the meeting passed, amidst warm applause, the patriotic declaration of the city's Catholics, a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao, a congratulatory telegram to the World Peace Council, a congratulatory telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and formulated the Beijing Catholic Patriotic Covenant. Immediately afterwards, in a solemn atmosphere, more than 10,000 people unanimously raised their hands to sign in support of the Five-Power Peace Pact and voted against the US rearmament of Japan. Finally, the whole audience shouted "Long live Chairman Mao, long live Stalin," and immediately began the demonstration parade.

　　The parade was led by a guard of honor, proceeding from Tiananmen in two routes, east and west. Every Catholic held a small flag with slogans such as "Support the resolution of the World Peace Council," "Demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact," "Oppose the US rearmament of Japan," and "Eliminate imperialist elements." Many people held high portraits of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Marshal Stalin, and General Kim Il-sung. Particularly touching was the fact that many Catholics in their seventies also came to participate in the demonstration parade in such a windy day. There were more than a dozen people over the age of seventy, including Mrs. Ye Renlan, who was already seventy-nine years old. In the parade, there were also thirty pedicab workers voluntarily pulling people who were too old. These pedicab workers were all patriotic Catholics who came to participate in the parade. The parade shouted slogans along the way, and young children vigorously performed Yangko dances and beat waist drums, receiving a warm welcome from the citizens on both sides of the road.

　　北京万余天主教徒举行爱国示威大游行
    一致签名拥护缔结和平公约，投票反对武装日本。
    【本报讯】北京市天主教徒于二十二日举行了盛大的拥护五大国缔结和平公约反对美国重新武装日本的示威大游行。参加游行的有天主教各堂口，各大、中、小学及各修女会等四十九个单位的教徒一万多人，约占全市三万多教徒的三分之一。这是北京市天主教徒空前未有的爱国表现。中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会宗教事务处处长何成湘，北京市抗美援朝分会副主席吴晗、秘书长李乐光和北京市人民政府文教局副局长薛成业出席指导。北京市佛教界保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会宣传部长达如亦应邀参加。
    正午十二时，各单位的教徒齐集在太和门前，游行示威大会在庄严的国歌声中开始。主席刘福栋致开会词说：美帝国主义强占了我国的领土台湾，发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，现在正残酷地屠杀朝鲜人民，滥炸我国和平居民，并阴谋单独对日媾和重新武装日本。我们爱国的天主教徒不能再容忍了，我们的心里燃烧着愤怒的火焰。我们北京市三万多天主教徒要紧密地团结起来，在毛主席的英明领导下，扩大和深入抗美援朝运动，坚决反对美国重新武装日本，特别要彻底肃清潜藏在天主教会内的帝国主义分子，保卫人民祖国的安全，打败美帝国主义的一切侵略和挑衅行为。接着讲话的有北京市天主教保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会副主席祝福祥和侯景毅。祝福祥说：今天我们所举行的爱国示威大游行，标志着我们天主教徒和帝国主义斗争的决心。不可否认，过去我们教友在爱国行动上表现得不够积极，不够具体。但是今天我们要告诉全中国、全亚洲和全世界的朋友们，北京市的天主教徒已觉悟过来了，而且行动起来了。我们今后一定勇敢地坚决地和你们站在一起，为建设祖国和保卫世界持久和平而奋斗。侯景毅说：今天我们天主教徒所举行的爱国示威游行，为今后积极开展三自革新运动打下了基础。我们不要仅仅在形式上与帝国主义割断关系，而是要在思想上和行动上与帝国主义割断关系。
    北京市抗美援朝分会副主席吴晗等应邀讲话。吴晗特别强调地指出：天主教徒在积极参加爱国运动的时候，要加倍警惕帝国主义的阴谋诡计，并把帝国主义分子肃清，以洗清他们给天主教造成的污点和坏影响。我相信除极少数甘心被帝国主义利用的天主教的败类外，绝大多数善良的爱国的教徒今后一定会更积极地推进三自革新运动。全国人民对你们的爱国行动，是热烈欢迎并全力支持的。政务院文化教育委员会宗教事务处处长何成湘在讲话中一再强调地说明，天主教徒为了积极参加爱国运动，就要坚决割断与帝国主义的关系，肃清帝国主义的影响，把披着宗教外衣实行文化侵略的帝国主义分子清除出去。而要使这一工作作得好，最有效的方式之一就是举行控诉会。因为通过控诉会，就可以揭露帝国主义利用宗教侵略我国的种种罪行，提高广大教徒的政治觉悟，明确地划清界线，分清敌友，达到驱逐帝国主义分子和与之相勾结的反动分子的目的。何处长并特别用前两天宗教事务处召集的处理接受美国津贴的基督教团体会议的实际例子来说明，控诉会对于提高到会各基督教团体代表的政治认识起了很大作用，因而使会议开得很成功。他希望北京市的天主教徒在示威游行以后，也像天津的天主教徒一样，发动教徒群众，召开各种不同形式的控诉会，通过具体事实，在广大教徒中展开反美爱国教育，这样才能够扩大和深入天主教徒的爱国运动。
    大会在教友代表宋静山等相继讲话后，在热烈的掌声中通过了全市天主教徒的爱国宣言、向毛主席致敬电、向世界和平理事会致敬电、向中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军致敬电，并制订了北京市天主教人士爱国公约。紧接着全场在庄严肃穆的气氛中，一万多人一致以举手的方式签名拥护五大国缔结和平公约，投票反对美国重新武装日本。最后全场高呼毛主席万岁、斯大林万岁，并立即开始了示威大游行。
    游行队伍以仪仗队为前导，出天安门分东西两路行进。每一个教徒都手执一面小旗，上面写着：“拥护世界和平理事会决议”、“要求五大国缔结和平公约”、“反对美国重新武装日本”、“肃清帝国主义分子”等口号。许多人高擎着毛主席、朱总司令、斯大林大元帅和金日成将军的画像。特别令人感动的是许多年已古稀的教徒在那样的大风天也赶来参加了示威游行，七十岁以上的就有十几人，其中叶纫兰老太太已经七十九岁了。在游行的行列中，还有三十个三轮车工人义务地拉着年纪过高的人，这些三轮车工人都是赶来参加游行的爱国天主教徒。游行队伍沿途高呼口号，青年儿童矫健活泼地扭着秧歌，打着腰鼓，受到两旁市民的热烈欢迎。
