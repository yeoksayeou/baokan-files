　　How to Carry Out the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Rural Areas?
　　Liao Gailong, Ma Jiaju
    The rural areas of various provinces in Northeast China, Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, Inner Mongolia, and Pingyuan in North China, Shandong, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, Northern Anhui, and Zhejiang in East China, Henan in Central South China, and some rural areas in other provinces and regions have already carried out propaganda and education work on Resist America, Aid Korea among the peasant masses, and have created many good experiences. Now, a preliminary summary of these experiences is made for reference by various regions.
    As in the cities, the decisive link in carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in rural areas is the serious attention and leadership of leading organs and cadres at all levels. The reason why the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in Yuci Special District of Shanxi Province achieved remarkable results is primarily because the Yuci District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed and implemented the slogan "Leaders are responsible, the whole party takes action, from the inside to the outside, from top to bottom." The experiences of other regions are also the same.
    In addition to the issue of leadership ideology, there is also the issue of leadership methods. The following will examine the methods for carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in rural areas.

  Train Cadres, Cultivate Movement Backbone
    To carry out the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education movement in rural areas, the first thing to do is to train cadres and cultivate movement backbone according to rural conditions and rural needs. Methods:
    First, train rural cadres, rural primary school and winter school (usually people-run schools) teachers, rural members of the Chinese Communist Party, and rural members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. The experience of Hebei Province is: take the county as a unit to concentrate primary and winter school teachers in each county for two or three days of training. The province trained a total of 70,000 people; at the same time, when training rural party member cadres, two to three days were used for current affairs and political education on Resist America, Aid Korea. The province trained a total of 100,000 people before the Spring Festival; in addition, the party and youth league branches, trade unions, and winter schools throughout the province all spent a month lecturing on current affairs issues. Therefore, a large number of cadres were cultivated throughout the province, making the widespread development of Resist America, Aid Korea possible.
    The experience of Changzhi Special District in Shanxi Province is: using methods such as cadre meetings, training classes, and specialized training to train rural propagandists. According to statistics from twelve counties including Pingshun and Huguan, a total of 9,810 propagandists were trained. Together with cadres, there were more than 10,000 people, with an average of five to twenty propagandists per village, who could universally carry out propaganda.
    Second, transfer office staff and mobilize college and middle school students. After a short period of training, send them to the countryside for propaganda, and make the land reform work teams, rent reduction work teams, and grain requisition work teams that are already working in the countryside also become Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda teams. Shanxi, Shandong, Southern Jiangsu, Henan and other provinces have adopted these methods (or one of them) with great success; the Northwest Administrative Region also plans to do so now. The points to note here are: when training cadres and students, the responsible person must personally make a report on the situation and tasks, and instruct on the content and methods of propaganda; when mobilizing rural work teams to participate in propaganda work, propaganda instructions, propaganda materials and various propaganda products should be compiled and provided to them.
    Third, convene Resist America, Aid Korea representative meetings at the county, district, and even village levels, or people's representative meetings at all levels centered on discussing Resist America, Aid Korea, and convene representative meetings of peasants, women, and youth at all levels on Resist America, Aid Korea. Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang in East China, and Henan in Central South China and other provinces and regions have adopted this method, cultivating a large number of backbone forces for carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement among the masses, enabling the movement to develop universally to the countryside. For example, Xuchang Special District in Henan convened representative meetings of all sectors, as well as workers, peasants, youth, and women, on Resist America, Aid Korea. Together with holding cadre meetings and running training classes, a total of 108,840 backbone members were trained, who were scattered to every corner of the masses after training, playing a great role.
    Siwei District of Hang County, Zhejiang, first convened the district's Resist America, Aid Korea representative meeting. In addition to district and township cadres, primary school teachers, village cadres, and activists also participated. At the meeting, the person in charge of the district made a mobilization report and launched a discussion to improve the understanding of the representatives attending the meeting. After the representatives returned to their villages, they convened village cadre meetings, youth, militia meetings, and women's representative meetings in townships to convey the content and spirit of the district representative meeting, and arranged work and formulated plans. Through the meeting, most village cadres, mass representatives, and activists understood the spirit of Resist America, Aid Korea, and used them as the backbone to deeply implement it among the masses.
    The Resist America, Aid Korea representative meetings convened in various parts of Shandong not only included reports and discussions, but also programs such as accusations and preliminary formulation of patriotic covenants for people from all walks of life. After such representative meetings, representatives from all walks of life also learned the methods of leading the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.

  Mobilize All Propaganda, Education, and Cultural Institutions in Rural Areas
    All propaganda, education, and cultural institutions in rural areas, including primary schools, winter schools (or people-run schools), reading groups, blackboards, rooftop broadcasts, drama troupes, rural clubs, etc., should be mobilized to promote Resist America, Aid Korea. Experience in various regions has proved that these institutions are not only tools for popularizing the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, but also the basis for making this movement last. Here, the experience of many places in using winter schools (people-run schools) to carry out Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda is particularly noteworthy. For example, Yuci County, Shanxi Province, where the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has achieved remarkable results, "relies on winter schools as the main support for carrying out Resist America, Aid Korea education."
    In rural areas of Northern Jiangsu, current affairs education is systematically conducted through the winter school system, and then propaganda is carried out to the masses separately through active learners in winter schools.
    Siwei District of Hang County, Zhejiang, also educates the general public through winter schools. The content of winter school education is simple textbooks compiled according to the spirit of the District Resist America, Aid Korea Representative Meeting, with a total of three topics: Lesson 1: "What benefits have you gotten since liberation? Where do the benefits come from?" Lesson 2: "What sufferings did you endure before liberation? Where is the root of the suffering?" Lesson 3: "After turning over and dividing the land, the American bandits are not reconciled and want to invade us. We must unite to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country." Teachers use such simple textbooks to first teach students to read and explain the meaning. After the teacher teaches for half an hour, township or village cadres make reports based on the textbooks and link them to the specific facts of the village, and then discuss them.
    In addition, Changzhi Special District in Shanxi Province and Xuchang Special District in Henan Province also made full use of winter schools for propaganda.

  Combine with Various Rural Work
    The Resist America, Aid Korea movement must be combined with the current work in rural areas everywhere in order to make it not only not hinder other work, but also become the driving force for promoting all work.
    The experience in the old liberated area of Shandong is: in propaganda, link the tasks of anti-feudalism and anti-imperialism, such as revealing rumors from analyzing the activities of illegal landlords and counter-revolutionary elements, encouraging mass morale, and making peasants dare to stand up and resolutely fight against the landlord class; in class demarcation, from clearly demarcating the boundaries between the landlord and peasant classes, further analyze the relationship between American imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the Chinese people. At present, mainly on the basis of completing land reform work, from in-depth inspection and summary of land reform work, and then recalling the crimes of landlords and Chiang bandits, comparing the differences between life before and after liberation, launch accusations against the landlord class, Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, Japanese devils, and American imperialism, so that the land reform inspection is more in-depth. Wherever land reform has not paid attention to linking Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda, mass awareness has been limited, or cadres and masses have developed a "relaxed" phenomenon after land reform.
    In new areas such as Southern Jiangsu, the peasants' land reform struggle is closely integrated with the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. The vast number of peasants actively participated in the anti-feudal struggle because they realized that the landlord class was the social foundation of American imperialism in China, and after the completion of land reform, they enthusiastically participated in the people's armed forces under the slogan of "Arming to defend the fruits of land reform." Peasants in various places also set off a wave of grain payment under the slogan of "Paying patriotic grain to support Resist America, Aid Korea," and completed the autumn levy task within half a month.
    In old liberated areas such as Tianjin Special District of Hebei Province, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement is well connected with the task of production. The people all participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea and defend the country movement with positive production actions. People in non-disaster areas proposed "Accumulate more fertilizer, prepare for spring plowing, and ensure more production." People in disaster areas regard "Overcoming disasters" and "No idlers in the village" as glorious actions of resisting America and loving the country.

  When Conducting Propaganda, Start from the Farmers' Own Experience and Launch Mass Accusations
    In order to carry out propaganda and education on Resist America, Aid Korea in rural areas, it is necessary to start from the vital interests and personal experiences of the peasant masses, and in addition to conducting propaganda and explanation to the masses, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses to educate themselves using the methods of complaining about suffering and recalling the past.
    The general experience of various places is: start from the good life of the peasants now, talk about the landlords and bullies and the Kuomintang attempting to destroy the good life of the peasants and re-enslave the peasants, and then connect to the American imperialists attempting to support the Kuomintang and landlord bullies to restore their rule, invade Korea and invade China, and then explain that in order to defend the good life of our peasants, it is necessary to resist America and aid Korea, and analyze the prospects for the victory of Resist America, Aid Korea, targeting the specific ideological concerns of the peasant masses. Such propaganda can touch the hearts of the peasants and can inspire them to accuse the crimes of landlords, bullies, the Kuomintang, and their backstage bosses, the Japanese and American aggressors.
    In order to make the propaganda targeted, it is necessary to conduct serious investigation and research work before the propaganda, to understand the local situation and the urgent demands, personal experiences and ideological problems of the masses.

  Emphasize the Use of Artistic Forms for Propaganda
    Because the cultural level of peasants is generally very low, various methods should be used for propaganda, especially emphasizing the use of maps, pictures, photos and various artistic forms.
    For propaganda in the countryside, a simple map of China, a map of Korea, and a map of the world are essential. In terms of pictures, large-scale comic strips are most popular with the masses.
    In terms of artistic propaganda, many places use slide shows to publicize current affairs, which are very popular with the masses. The farmers of Southern Jiangsu call the slide show "local movies". In Xuchang Special District of Henan Province, among various propaganda methods, performing dramas in new and old forms is most popular with the masses. The drama propaganda conference jointly organized by teachers from various schools in Taicheng District of Lin颍 absorbed two to three million people each time in early December of last year. Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, achieved great success in using shadow plays for Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda. Nine shadow play groups performed shadow plays such as "The Brutality of American Imperialism," "Another Blood Debt," and "The End of the Invaders" in every village in Shuangcheng County, with a total audience of 304,000 people in two months.

  Organize Patriotic Activities of the Peasant Masses and Establish Patriotic Covenants
    On the basis of raising the political awareness of the peasant masses, organizing them to write letters and donate money to comfort the volunteers, as well as various patriotic activities around the current central work in the local area, are methods to achieve the goal of the movement; and in general, demonstrations and parades can be made a climax of the popularization movement.
    As in the cities, the establishment of patriotic covenants should also be promoted among the rural people. Mobilizing the masses to formulate and practice patriotic covenants is an effective way to consolidate the achievements of the movement.
    The experience of rural areas in Fujian Province in formulating patriotic covenants is worth learning. The method is: mobilize in advance at rural people's organizations (such as farmers' associations, militia, women's associations, etc.), or regional mass meetings (such as a village, several villages, or a centralized township), and then mobilize everyone to propose and discuss the content of the patriotic covenant, and establish a check-up system for half a month or a month. Only patriotic covenants formulated in this way are the peasants' own patriotic covenants, and only such patriotic covenants can be implemented. If the masses are not mobilized to seriously discuss, it will become merely an activity of a few cadres and activists, and thus the patriotic covenant will inevitably become a formality.

　　怎样在农村中开展抗美援朝运动？
　　廖盖隆　马家驹
    东北的各省，华北的山西、河北、察哈尔、内蒙、平原，华东的山东、苏南、苏北、皖南、皖北、浙江，中南的河南等省区的许多农村，以及其他许多省、区的部分农村，已经在农民群众中开展了抗美援朝的宣传教育工作，创造了许多好的经验。现在把这些经验作一个初步的整理，以供各地参考。
    和在城市一样，要在农村中开展抗美援朝运动，决定的环节是各级领导机关和干部的认真重视和认真领导。山西榆次专区抗美援朝运动所以获得显著成绩，首先就是因为中共榆次地委提出并贯彻了“首长负责，全党动手，由内而外，由上而下”的口号。其他各地的经验也是这样。
    除了领导思想问题之外，就是领导方法问题，以下就来研究在农村中开展抗美援朝运动的方法。
  训练干部，培养运动骨干
    要在农村开展抗美援朝宣传教育运动，首先就是要按照农村条件和农村的需要来训练干部，培养运动的骨干。方法：
    第一是训练农村干部，农村小学及冬学（在平时是民校）教师、中国共产党的农村党员和中国新民主主义青年团的农村团员。河北省的经验是：以县为单位用两三天的时间集训各县的小学及冬学教师，全省共训练了七万人；同时，在集训农村党员干部时，用两天到三天的时间进行抗美援朝的时事政治教育，全省在春节前共训练了十万人；此外，全省的党、团支部，工会、冬学都以一个月时间讲授时事问题。因此就在全省培养了大量干部，使抗美援朝的普遍发展成为可能。
    山西省长治专区的经验是：用干部会等会议、训练班和专门训练等办法训练农村宣传员。据平顺、壶关等十二个县的统计，共训练了九千八百一十名宣传员，再加上干部即有一万余人，平均每村有五个至二十个宣传员，可以普遍进行宣传。
    第二是抽调机关工作人员，发动大中学生，在训练一个短时期以后，派遣他们下乡宣传，并使已下乡工作的土地改革工作队、减租工作队、征粮工作队等同时成为抗美援朝的宣传队。山西、山东、苏南、河南等省都采取了这些方法（或其中一种），很有成效；西北大行政区现在也计划这样做。这里要注意的问题是：在训练干部、学生的时候，要由负责人员亲自作形势和任务的报告，并指示宣传内容和方法；在动员农村工作队参加宣传工作的时候，要编印宣传指示、宣传资料和各种宣传品供给他们。
    第三是召开各县、各区以至各乡村的抗美援朝代表会议或以讨论抗美援朝为中心的各界人民代表会议，并召开各级农民、妇女、青年的抗美援朝代表会议。华东区的山东、苏北、苏南、浙江和中南区的河南等省区都采取了这种办法，培养了在群众中开展抗美援朝运动的大批骨干，使运动普遍发展到乡村去。例如河南许昌专区召开了各界的以及工人、农民、青年、妇女抗美援朝代表会议，连同开干部会、办训练班一起，共计训练了十万八千八百四十个骨干分子，训练后散布到群众中的各个角落去，起了很大作用。
    浙江杭县四维区首先召开了区的抗美援朝代表会，除区、乡干部外，并有小学教师及村干部及积极分子参加，会议上由区的负责人做了动员报告，并展开讨论，提高到会代表的认识。代表回乡后以乡为单位召开村干部大会、青年、民兵会、妇女代表会等会议，传达区代表会的内容和精神，并布置工作，制定计划。通过会议，使大部分村干部、群众代表、积极分子领会了抗美援朝的精神，又以他们为骨干，深入贯彻到群众中去。
    山东各地召开的抗美援朝代表会议，不但有报告、讨论，而且有控诉及初步订立各界人民的爱国公约等节目。经过这种代表会议之后，各界代表也就学会了领导抗美援朝运动的方法。
  把农村中所有宣传教育文化机构都动员起来
    农村中所有的宣传教育文化机构，包括小学、冬学（或民校）、读报组、黑板报、屋顶广播、剧团、农村俱乐部等，都应该动员起来，宣传抗美援朝。各地的经验证明，这些机构不但是普及抗美援朝运动的工具，而且是使这一运动持久进行的依托。在这里，许多地方利用冬学（民校）进行抗美援朝宣传的经验特别值得注意。例如抗美援朝运动取得显著成绩的山西省榆次县就是“以冬学为进行抗美援朝教育的主要依托”的。
    苏北农村中是通过冬学系统地进行时事教育，再通过冬学中的学习积极分子，分头向群众进行宣传。
    浙江杭县四维区也是通过冬学，对广大群众进行教育的。冬学的教育内容是根据区抗美援朝代表会的精神编写的简单课文，共三个课题：第一课：“解放以来得了那些好处？好处是那里来的？”第二课：“解放以前受过那些苦头？苦根在那里？”第三课：“翻了身，分了田，美国强盗不甘心，要想侵略我们，我们要团结起来抗美援朝，保家卫国。”教师就用这样简单的课文，先教学员识字，解释意义。教师教了半个钟头，就由乡干部或村干部根据课文联系本村具体事实作报告，然后讨论。
    此外，山西长治专区和河南许昌专区，也尽量利用冬学进行了宣传。
  与各项农村工作相结合
    抗美援朝运动必须与各地农村的当前工作相结合，才能使它不但不妨碍其他工作，而且成为推动一切工作的动力。
    山东半老区农村的经验是：在宣传中，把反封建与反对帝国主义的任务联系起来，如从分析不法地主和反革命分子的活动中揭破了谣言，鼓励了群众斗志，使农民敢于起来坚决向地主阶级斗争；在划阶级中，从划清地主与农民两大阶级界限又进而分析美帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮同中国人民的关系。目前，主要在结束土地改革工作的基础上，从深入检查和总结土地改革工作，进而回忆地主、蒋匪罪恶，对比解放以前及以后生活的不同，展开对地主阶级、蒋介石匪帮、日本鬼子、美帝国主义的控诉，使土地改革的检查更加深入。凡在土地改革中没有注意联系抗美援朝宣传的地方，群众觉悟就受到限制，或土地改革后产生干部与群众“松气”现象。
    在新区如苏南，农民的土地改革斗争与抗美援朝运动密切结合着。广大农民因为认识到地主阶级是美帝国主义在中国的社会基础而积极参加反封建斗争，并在土地改革完成以后，在“武装保卫土地改革果实”的口号下踊跃参加人民的武装。各地农民还在“缴爱国粮，支援抗美援朝”的口号下，掀起缴粮热潮，在半个月内就完成了秋征任务。
    在老区农村如河北省的天津专区，抗美援朝运动与生产的任务连结得很好。人民群众都以生产的积极行动参加抗美援朝保家卫国运动。非灾区人民提出“多积肥，准备春耕，保证多增产”。灾区人民则以“战胜灾荒”“全村无闲人”作为抗美爱国的光荣行动。
  进行宣传时要从农民群众的切身经验出发，并应发动群众的控诉
        运动
    在农村进行抗美援朝的宣传教育，必须从农民群众的切身利益和切身经验出发，并且除了向群众进行宣传讲解以外，还要发动群众用诉苦、回忆的方法自己教育自己。
    各地成功的经验一般都是：从农民现在的好日子讲起，说到地主恶霸和国民党企图破坏农民的好日子，重新奴役农民，再进而联系到美国帝国主义企图扶持国民党、地主恶霸复辟，侵略朝鲜和侵略中国，然后说明，为了保卫咱们农民的好光景，必须抗美援朝，并针对农民群众中的具体的思想上的顾虑，分析抗美援朝必胜的前途。这样的宣传，就能打动农民的心坎，并能启发他们控诉地主恶霸、国民党和他们的后台老板日本、美国侵略者的罪恶。
    为着做到使宣传有的放矢，在宣传以前，就须要认真进行调查研究的工作，了解当地的各种情况和群众的迫切要求、切身经验和思想问题。
  着重地使用艺术形式进行宣传
    因为农民的文化水平一般很低，所以进行宣传时要运用多种多样的方式，尤其是要着重地运用地图、图画、照片以及各种艺术形式。
    下乡宣传，一幅简明的中国大地图，一幅朝鲜地图、一幅世界地图是不可少的。图画方面，大幅的连环图画最受群众欢迎。
    在艺术宣传方面，许多地方使用幻灯宣传时事，很受群众喜爱。苏南农民把幻灯叫做土电影。河南许昌专区各种宣传方式中以演新旧形式的戏剧最得群众欢迎。临颍台陈区各校教员在去年十二月初旬所联合组织的戏剧宣传大会，每次都吸收群众两三万人。松江省双城县运用皮影戏进行抗美援朝宣传，获得很大成绩。九个皮影小组在双城县每个村庄中演出《美帝国主义暴行》、《又一笔血债》、《侵略者的下场》等皮影戏，两个月内观众共达三十万四千余人。
  组织农民群众的爱国活动，订立爱国公约
    在农民群众政治觉悟提高的基础上，组织他们写信捐款慰问志愿军以及围绕着当地当前中心工作的各种爱国活动，是达到运动目标的方法；而一般都可以使示威游行成为普及运动的高潮。
    和在城市一样，订立爱国公约在农村人民中也是应当推广的。发动群众订立爱国公约和实践爱国公约，是巩固运动成果的有效方法。
    福建省农村订立爱国公约的经验是值得学习的。方法是：在农村各个人民团体（如农会、民兵、妇女会组织等），或地区性的群众会议上（如一个村、几个村、或一个集中的乡），事先作动员，然后再发动大家提出和讨论爱国公约的内容，并订出半个月或一个月的检查制度。只有这样订出的爱国公约，才是农民自己的爱国公约，也只有这样的爱国公约才能够贯彻。如不发动群众认真讨论，就会变成为仅仅是少数干部和积极分子的活动，因而爱国公约就必定流于形式。
