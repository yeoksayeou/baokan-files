Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th. Throughout the Soviet Union, at the sites of communist construction projects, in factories and mines, on railways and waterways, in collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations, labor competitions are underway to greet May Day. The competitions revolve around better use of technical equipment, increasing production, improving quality, reducing costs, and saving raw materials and materials.

The oil workers of Bashkir, Tatar, Kuban, and Kuibyshev wrote to Stalin, guaranteeing to extract 230,000 tons of oil ahead of schedule and above plan in 1951. The coal miners of Kuzbass, Stalin Oblast, Karaganda, and Rostov guaranteed to Stalin that they would extract 1.15 million tons of coal ahead of schedule and above plan in 1951. Workers in metallurgy, machine manufacturing, logging, construction, and other industries have also joined the competition. Many industrial enterprises are enthusiastically competing to complete orders for communist construction projects ahead of schedule.

The competitions in various regions have already achieved preliminary results. Some coal mines in Kuzbass and Donbass, and some oil wells in Baku, have completed the first quarter's production tasks ahead of schedule and above plan, becoming Stakhanovite enterprises. The number of enterprises producing high-quality products is increasing daily. More and more production innovators are emerging. Rybak, a foreman at the Moscow "Shaving Machine" Factory, initiated a competition to produce inexpensive and high-quality products based on better use of technical equipment, which has been responded to by many enterprises in Moscow.

In rural areas, early-maturing crops have been planted in many areas of southern Soviet Union. The spring sowing work is expanding from the south to the southeast and central regions, and the competition to win the sowing victory is also expanding. The Buneyev tractor team in Kuban initiated a competition to fully utilize the capacity of tractors and strive for good harvests, which has been responded to by tractor drivers across the country. The competition to better use machinery, improve farming techniques, and strive for new agricultural victories is being widely carried out in collective farms in Ukraine, Moldova, and other republics. In letters to Stalin, Uzbek cotton workers guaranteed to produce 500,000 tons more raw cotton than last year, and Azerbaijani agricultural workers guaranteed a good harvest of cotton and wheat, guaranteeing to produce 60,000 to 70,000 tons more raw cotton than last year.

　　苏联展开劳动竞赛迎接五一节
    工人纷纷写信给斯大林保证提前超计划完成生产
    【新华社莫斯科十三日电】在苏联的共产主义建设工程所在地、在工厂和矿山、铁路和水道、集体农场、国营农场和机器拖拉机站，到处展开了迎接五一节的劳动竞赛。竞赛围绕着更好地使用技术装备、增加产品、改善质量、减低成本、节约原料、材料等方面进行。
    巴什基尔、鞑靼、库班、古比雪夫州的石油工人写信给斯大林，保证一九五一年提前超计划采油二十三万吨。库兹巴斯、斯大林州、卡拉干达、罗斯多夫的采煤工人，向斯大林保证一九五一年提前超计划采煤一百十五万吨。冶金、机器制造、木材采伐、建筑及其他各业工人，都已投入竞赛之中。许多工业企业为提前完成共产主义建设工程的定货，正热烈进行着竞赛。
    各地的竞赛已得到初步成绩。库兹巴斯和顿巴斯的某些煤矿和巴库的某些油井，已超计划完成了第一季生产任务，成为斯塔哈诺夫式的企业。优等质量产品的企业日益增加。更多的生产革新者涌现出来。莫斯科“削截机”制造厂领班雷巴克，创议在更好使用技术装备的基础上举行出产价廉物美的产品的竞赛，得到了莫斯科许多企业的响应。
    在农村里，苏联南部许多地区已种下早熟作物。春播工作正从南方向东南部和中部地区扩大，争取播种胜利的竞赛也随着在扩大。库班布涅耶夫拖拉机队发起竞赛，要充分发挥拖拉机能力和争取好收成，已经得到了全国拖拉机手的响应。更好地使用机器、提高耕作技术、争取农业新胜利的竞赛，在乌克兰、摩尔达维亚及其他共和国的集体农场中广泛地进行着。在给斯大林的信中，乌兹贝克棉业劳动者保证比去年多生产五十万吨生棉，阿塞拜疆农业劳动者保证棉花和小麦得到好收成，保证比去年多生产六至七万吨生棉。
