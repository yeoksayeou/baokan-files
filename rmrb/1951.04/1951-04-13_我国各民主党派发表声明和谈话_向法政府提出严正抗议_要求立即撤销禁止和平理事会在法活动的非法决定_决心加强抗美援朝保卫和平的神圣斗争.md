China's Democratic Parties Issue Statements and Speeches
　　Lodging Stern Protests with the French Government
　　Demanding the Immediate Revocation of the Illegal Decision to Ban the Peace Council's Activities in France
　　Determined to Strengthen the Sacred Struggle to Resist America and Aid Korea and Defend Peace
　　[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiusan Society, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, among other democratic parties, issued statements and speeches on April 12, protesting the French government's unreasonable measures in following the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and banning the World Peace Council from operating within France. The statements from all the democratic parties unanimously pointed out that the people of the world, including the French people, urgently demand world peace and firmly oppose war. This unreasonable measure by the French government has aroused great anger among peace-loving people worldwide.
　　The statement issued by the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang stated: "The reactionary French government is openly obstructing and undermining the cause of peace, which proves that it is the mortal enemy of the French people and the mortal enemy of peace-loving people all over the world. We cannot tolerate this reactionary group and their unreasonable and illegal measures against the people. In addition to lodging a serious protest and condemnation against this reactionary government, we must use practical actions to popularize and deepen the Resist America and Aid Korea movement to deal a fatal blow to the imperialist warmongers. We believe that peace will surely triumph, and war must be eliminated."
　　The spokesperson for the China Democratic League stated: "The French government's ban on the World Peace Council's activities in France is a grave insult to the millions upon millions of people worldwide who are fervently signing the Declaration on the Conclusion of a Peace Pact. We feel immense anger at this reactionary and unreasonable measure by the French government! The World Peace Council represents the will of the people of the world who love peace and is an organization that strives to win and defend world peace. Its righteous calls and activities have set off a high tide of combating war conspiracies in every corner of the world. The French government, complying with the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression, is not only expanding its military and preparing for war but also frantically massacring the Vietnamese people. Now, it is so blatantly persecuting the world peace movement, which proves once again its hideous face of hating peace and being the enemy of the people all over the world. Faced with this tyrannical behavior of the French government, in addition to firmly expressing our protest, we, the China Democratic League, will launch a more active signature campaign to support the conclusion of a peace pact and a more in-depth Resist America and Aid Korea patriotic movement to counter the warmongers' attack on peace."
　　The spokesperson for the China National Democratic Construction Association said: "This is the most ugly action after the French government banned the activities in January of this year of the three major democratic organizations of the world—the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth. This fact once again exposes the French government's ferocious face of opposing peace and insisting on aggression; at the same time, it also proves that the French Republic, which has a glorious tradition of freedom and democracy, has completely changed its face under the rule of the reactionary government, becoming the most loyal and docile running dog of the American imperialists, and becoming a fascist thug. Of course, this is completely not the intention of the broad masses of the French people. The French people are firmly opposed to this shameful behavior." The spokesperson continued: "Our members of the Democratic National Construction Association, together with the national industrialists and businessmen and the people of China, all love peace. We lodge a serious protest against the French government's reactionary measures of blatantly antagonizing peace and demand that it immediately revoke this completely unreasonable order."
　　The statement of the China Association for Promoting Democracy pointed out: The World Peace Council is today the only legitimate international peace organization that fully embodies the will of all peace-loving people in the world and safeguards world peace and international security. The unreasonable ban by the reactionary French government on the activities of the World Peace Council in France once again exposed the fact that the reactionary French government is following the U.S. imperialist policy of aggressive war, hating peace, fearing peace, undermining peace, betraying the interests of the French people, and is determined to be the enemy of the peace-loving people of the world. It continued: "We seriously warn the French government that history must follow the will of the broad masses of the people. The peace and democracy movement, which is enthusiastically supported and resolutely promoted by all good people in the world, will never be stopped by any reactionary violence; reactionary violence will only accelerate the imperialism's own decay, collapse, and demise."
　　The statement of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party stated: "The worldwide activities to defend peace will never be banned by a reactionary order. On the contrary, the peace-loving people of the world will unite more closely around the World Peace Council and give a merciless counterattack to the warmongers' provocations. We, the entire members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, express our strong protest against the reactionary measures of the French government and demand the immediate revocation of this shameful order. For the cause of world peace, we once again call on party members across the country to actively strive to realize the ten resolutions of the First World Peace Council and more widely mobilize the people across the country to sign the declaration demanding the conclusion of a peace pact. Popularize and deepen the Resist America and Aid Korea movement, oppose U.S. imperialism's rearmament of Japan and West Germany, and assist the government in resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries, so as to respond to the warmongers' provocations."
　　The statement of the China Zhi Gong Party stated: "The reactionary order recently issued by the French government banning the activities of the World Peace Council in France fully exposes the ferocious face of the reactionary French government. It not only violates the interests of the French people, violates the democratic traditions of France, but also willingly follows the U.S. imperialist war policy, carrying out tyrannical acts that obstruct world peace and undermine the cause of democracy. This fact also shows the warmongers’ fear of peace forces, and they do not hesitate to take all means to suppress the people’s desire for peace and democracy. But we firmly believe that the solemn cause of the people of the world to defend peace is absolutely unstoppable, and the peace movement in France will never be banned by a reactionary order from the French government. We, the entire comrades of the China Zhi Gong Party, express our serious protest against this reactionary measure of the French government and demand the immediate revocation of this illegal decision. And we are determined to work with the people of the whole country to fight to the end to defend world peace."
　　The statement of the Jiusan Society stated: "We can solemnly tell the French imperialists: The World Peace Council, which represents hundreds of millions of people in eighty countries who love peace and are fighting to defend the cause of peace, and its just activities in every corner of the world, including those in France, will never be 'banned' by the reactionary order of the French government. Like the peace-loving people of the whole world, the Chinese people must support all activities of the World Peace Council with more tenacious actions and completely smash the aggressive policy of the imperialist bloc. We feel immense anger at the reactionary measures of the French government banning the activities of the World Peace Council in France. Members of the Society should work with people from cultural, educational and scientific circles throughout the country to support the resolutions of the World Peace Council, widely launch a signature campaign to support the declaration for the conclusion of a peace pact, and continue to adhere to the sacred struggle to Resist America and Aid Korea and defend our homeland, so that the imperialists' conspiracy to launch a new war will be completely bankrupt in the face of the powerful strength of the people of the world."
　　The statement of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League stated: "The French imperialists' attempt will be completely in vain. The just activities of the World Peace Council, which are deeply rooted in the hearts of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world, will not be stopped by an order from the reactionary French government." It also stated: "We vow to intensify our efforts and work with the people of the world to closely unite around the World Peace Council, fight to defend world peace, and completely smash the imperialists' conspiracy to undermine the cause of world peace!"

　　我国各民主党派发表声明和谈话
    向法政府提出严正抗议
    要求立即撤销禁止和平理事会在法活动的非法决定
    决心加强抗美援朝保卫和平的神圣斗争
    【本报讯】中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、民主建国会、中国民主促进会、中国农工民主党、中国致公党、九三学社、台湾民主自治同盟等民主党派，于四月十二日纷纷发表声明和谈话，抗议法国政府追随美帝国主义侵略政策，禁止世界和平理事会在法国境内活动的无理措施。各民主党派的声明中一致指出：全世界人民包括法国人民在内，是迫切要求世界和平，坚决反对战争的。法国政府的这一无理措施，引起了全世界爱好和平人民的极大愤怒。
    中国国民党革命委员会发表的声明称：“法国反动政府竟公然阻止和破坏和平事业，这证明了它是法国人民的死敌，也是全世界爱好和平人民的死敌，我们对于这一反动分子集团和他们与人民为敌的无理的非法的措施是不能容忍的，我们除一面向这反动政府提出严重的抗议与谴责外，并要以普及和深入抗美援朝的实际行动予帝国主义战争贩子们以致命的打击，我们相信和平一定是胜利，战争必然要消灭。”
    中国民主同盟发言人称：“法国政府禁止世界和平理事会在法国境内活动，这是给予全世界正热烈地在关于缔结和平公约宣言上签名的千千万万人民的重大侮辱。对于法国政府这一反动无理的措施，我们感到无比的愤怒！世界和平理事会是代表全世界人民爱好和平的意志，为争取并保卫世界和平而奋斗的组织。它的正义号召与活动，已在全世界每一角落掀起了打击战争阴谋的高潮。法国政府顺从美帝国主义侵略政策，既进行扩军备战，又疯狂屠杀越南人民，现在竟如此明目张胆地迫害世界和平运动，实再度证明了它仇视和平、与全世界人民为敌的狰狞面目。面对法国政府这一横暴行为，我们中国民主同盟除坚决表示抗议外，将以更积极地展开拥护缔结和平公约的签名运动和更深入的抗美爱国运动，来还击战争贩子对和平的进攻。”
    民主建国会发言人的发言称：“这是法国政府在今年一月禁止世界三大民主团体——世界工会联合会、国际民主妇女联合会和世界民主青年联盟活动之后，又一最丑恶的行动。这个事实，再度暴露了法国政府的反对和平与坚持侵略的凶恶面目；同时也证明了，有光荣的自由、民主传统的法兰西共和国，在反动政府统治之下，已经完全改变了面目，变成了美国帝国主义者最忠实、驯顺的走卒，变成了法西斯的暴徒。当然，这完全不是法国广大人民的意向，法国人民是坚决反对这种可耻的行为的。”发言人继称：“我们民建会员及全国工商业者和全中国人民一道，都是爱好和平的。我们对法国政府这种悍然与和平为敌的反动措施，提出严重的抗议，并要求它立即撤销这种完全没有理由的命令。”
    中国民主促进会的声明指出：世界和平理事会是今天唯一的完全体现全世界所有爱好和平人民意志、维护世界和平与国际安全的合法的国际和平机构，法国反动政府无理地禁止世界和平理事会在法国境内活动，又一次地暴露了法国反动政府追随着美帝国主义的侵略战争政策，仇视和平，害怕和平，破坏和平，出卖法国人民利益，决心与全世界爱好和平人民为敌。继称：“我们严重警告法国政府，历史一定遵循着广大人民的意志前进。全世界所有善良人民所热烈支持和坚决推进的和平民主运动绝不是任何反动暴力所能阻遏的；反动暴力只有加速帝国主义自己的腐朽、崩溃和灭亡。”
    中国农工民主党的声明中称：“全世界保卫和平的活动，决不是一纸反动命令所能禁止的。相反地，全世界爱好和平的人民，将更紧密地团结在世界和平理事会的周围，给战争贩子的挑衅，予以无情的还击。我们中国农工民主党全体党员，对于法国政府的反动措施提出强烈的抗议，并要求立即撤销这一可耻的命令。为着世界和平事业，我们再号召全国党员积极地为实现第一届世界和平理事会的十大决议而奋斗，更广泛地发动全国人民在要求缔结和平公约的宣言上签名。普及深入抗美援朝运动，反对美帝国主义重新武装日本和西德，协助政府坚决镇压反革命，这样来答复战争贩子的挑衅。”
    中国致公党的声明称：“法国政府最近发布的禁止世界和平理事会在法国境内活动的反动命令，十足暴露出法国反动政府的凶恶面目。它不但违反了法国人民的利益，违背了法国的民主传统，进而甘心追随美国帝国主义战争政策，进行着阻挠世界和平，破坏民主事业的横暴行为。这个事实，也说明了帝国主义战争贩子们对和平力量的害怕，他们已不惜采取一切手段来压制人民要求和平民主的愿望。但我们坚信全世界人民保卫和平的庄严事业，是绝对制止不了的，而法国境内的和平运动，也绝不是法国政府一道反动命令所能禁止的。我们中国致公党全体同志，对于法国政府这种反动措施，提出严重抗议，要求立即撤销这一非法决定。并决心与我全国人民一道为保卫世界和平而奋斗到底。”
    九三学社的声明称：“我们可以正告法帝国主义者：代表世界上八十个国家亿万人民热爱和平并为保卫和平事业而斗争的世界和平理事会，它在全世界每一角落的正义活动，包括在法国境内的活动在内，绝不是法国政府的反动命令所能‘禁止’的。和全世界爱好和平的人民一样，中国人民一定要以更坚韧的行动支持世界和平理事会的一切活动，彻底粉碎帝国主义集团的侵略政策。我们对于法国政府禁止世界和平理事会在法国境内活动的反动措施感到无比的愤怒。本社社员当和全国文教科学界人士一道拥护世界和平理事会的决议，广泛地展开拥护缔结和平公约宣言的签名运动，继续坚持抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣斗争，使帝国主义发动新战争的阴谋在强大的世界人民力量面前彻底破产。”
    台湾民主自治同盟的声明称：“法国帝国主义的企图是会完全落空的。根深蒂固地活在世界亿万爱好和平人民中的世界和平理事会的正义活动，是不会因法国反动政府的一道命令而停止的。”并称：“我们誓加紧努力工作，和全世界人民一道紧密团结在世界和平理事会的周围，为保卫世界和平而奋斗，彻底粉碎帝国主义破坏世界和平事业的阴谋！”
