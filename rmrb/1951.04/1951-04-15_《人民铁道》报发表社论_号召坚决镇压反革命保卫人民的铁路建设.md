　　*People's Railway* Newspaper Publishes Editorial
    Calling for Resolute Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries to Defend the People's Railway Construction
    [By Our Newspaper] The *People's Railway* newspaper published an editorial on the 12th of this month entitled "Resolutely Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries, Defend the People's Railway Construction." The editorial stated: The recent counter-revolutionary cases cracked by our railway public security departments in conjunction with local public security organs should serve as a painful lesson for us. The editorial pointed out: The erroneous views of some comrades who only pay attention to production and not to defending production, who only bury themselves in construction work and do not concern themselves with politics, who separate economic work from political tasks and fail to unify them, must be immediately overcome. Some comrades believe that suppressing counter-revolutionaries will affect our unity with technical personnel. This statement is incorrect. We can only better unite with technical personnel by eliminating counter-revolutionary elements; suppressing counter-revolutionaries cannot be confused with uniting technical personnel in this way. Some people think, "It's too bad to kill these people! They have skills!" This is also wrong. Isn't it precisely because the special agents have skills that they use those skills to create sabotage accidents? The editorial emphasized: Because many of our comrades still harbor the above-mentioned incorrect and harmful erroneous ideas, their understanding of suppressing counter-revolutionaries as our current important political task is insufficient, and they have not closely integrated the suppression of counter-revolutionaries with the Resist America, Aid Korea education and patriotic production emulation movement, and therefore have not well mobilized all employees to launch a mass movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries within the railway. Failure to suppress these resolute counter-revolutionary elements will prevent the vast number of employees from seeking justice and revenge, and there will be no safety on the railway. Therefore, it is necessary to boldly mobilize the masses, widely carry out propaganda and mobilization, vigorously and severely suppress, and resolutely eliminate the counter-revolutionary elements lurking within the railway to protect the safety within the People's Railway.

　　《人民铁道》报发表社论
    号召坚决镇压反革命保卫人民的铁路建设
    【本报讯】本月十二日出版的《人民铁道》报以《坚决镇压反革命，保卫人民铁路建设》为题发表社论。社论称：最近我铁路公安部门会同地方公安机关所破获的一些反革命案件，应该作为我们沉痛的教训。社论指出：有些同志只注意生产，不注意保卫生产，只埋头建设业务不问政治，将经济工作与政治任务分离而不能统一起来的错误观点，必须立即加以克服。有些同志认为：镇压反革命会影响我们团结技术人员。这种说法是不正确的。我们只有消除反革命分子才能更好地团结技术人员，镇压反革命与团结技术人员是不能这样混淆的。有的人认为“杀了这些人太可惜了！有技术！”这也是错误的。特务分子不是正因为他有技术才利用技术制造破坏事故？社论强调指出：由于我们不少同志还存在上述不正确而有害的错误思想，对镇压反革命是我们当前重要政治任务的认识不足，没有很好地将镇压反革命与抗美援朝教育与爱国生产竞赛运动密切结合，因而没有很好发动全体职工展开铁路内部镇压反革命的群众运动。不镇压这些坚决反革命分子就不能为广大职工伸冤报仇，就没有铁路的安全，因此必须放手发动群众，广泛进行宣传动员，大张旗鼓严厉镇压，坚决肃清铁路内部潜伏的反革命分子，保卫人民铁路内的安全。
