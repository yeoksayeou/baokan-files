International Developments

　　US Government Forced to Temporarily Suspend "Universal Military Training"
　　Chairman of the House Military Committee Vinson revealed in his conversation that the US government has been forced to withdraw its request for the immediate passage of the "universal military training" plan. He said he would soon introduce an amendment requiring a temporary suspension of action under this plan. This is because the American people's opposition to "forced conscription" is growing day by day, and the US government has had to temporarily ease the people's resentment.

　　Accidents in Japanese Factories Increase Continuously
　　Due to a lack of labor safety design, accidents occur daily and are constantly increasing in Japanese industrial enterprises. According to Japanese official statistics, an average of twenty-two accidents occur every day in Kawasaki enterprises. In 1950, more than 70,000 workers suffered 4,325 serious injuries, 3,750 minor injuries, and 16 deaths. Accidents in Tsurumi Ward enterprises increased more than threefold last year compared to the previous year. This is the result of the Yoshida puppet government, the running dog of American imperialism, betraying the interests of the Japanese people.

　　Truman Requests Additional Military Spending
　　In order to expand preparations for a new world war, the US ruling clique is constantly increasing military spending. US President Truman recently requested Congress to approve an additional appropriation of $6.422 billion for the US military this year. This will bring the US budget directly used for war purposes this year to $48.2 billion.

　　Indian Workers Strengthen Struggle
　　The All-India Trade Union Congress of the Upper Pradesh (formerly United Provinces) held a plenary meeting of the council in Kuala Lumpur, attended by representatives from railways, tea gardens, power stations, and the textile industry from various regions. The meeting adopted a program for a united labor front, stipulating that it would intensify the struggle for peace, consolidate friendship with the Soviet Union and China; confiscate all foreign capital and nationalize major industries; establish a minimum supply of necessities and a system of unemployment relief; guarantee the rights of working people to participate in trade unions and strikes, and guarantee freedom of action for all political parties; cancel all sentences against political prisoners; guarantee equal suffrage; establish price controls and abolish predatory taxes; and abolish the land ownership system of feudal landlords. The Indian working class's struggle for peace and its own interests is increasingly strengthening and expanding.

　　Britain's Request for Dollars Rejected
　　US Deputy Secretary of State Webb informed British Ambassador Franks that the State Department was unwilling to ask Congress to provide "free dollars" to Britain to protect its economy from the impact of military needs. The New York Times correspondent in London, Wells, said: The fact that Britain, Belgium, or Portugal can no longer obtain dollars has caused anxiety in London. This is the sorrow of a vassal state.

  美政府被迫暂缓实施“普遍军训”
    美国国会众议院军事委员会主席文森在他的谈话中透露，美国政府已被迫撤回关于立即通过“普遍军训”计划的要求。他说他不久就要提出一项修正案，要求暂缓按照这计划采取行动。这是因为美国人民反对“强迫征训”的一天比一天多，美国政府就不得不暂时缓和一下人民的反感。
  日本工厂意外事件不断增加
    由于欠缺劳动安全设计，日本工业各企业中，意外事件每天都有发生，而且不断增加。据日本官方统计，在川崎市各企业平均每天发生二十二件意外事件。七万多名工人在一九五○年中有四千三百二十五名受重伤，三千七百五十名受轻伤，十六名死亡。鹤见区各企业意外事件，去年比前年增加了三倍以上。这是美国帝国主义的走狗吉田傀儡政府出卖日本人民利益的结果。
  杜鲁门要求追加军费
    美国统治集团为了要扩大准备新的世界大战，正把军事支出不断增大。美国总统杜鲁门最近又要求国会批准本年度为美国军队追加拨款六十四亿二千二百万美元。这就使美国本年度直接用于战争用途的预算将达到四百八十二亿美元了。
  印度工人加强斗争
    印度上布拉第省（前联合省）工会大会在瓜伦坡举行了理事会全体会议，出席的有来自各地的铁路、茶园、电力站和纺织工业的代表们。会议通过了劳工统一战线纲领，规定加紧为和平而斗争，为巩固对苏联及中国的友好而斗争；没收一切外国资本，并将主要工业收归国有；建立最低限度的生活资料的供应和发给失业救济金制度；保障劳动人民参加工会和罢工的权利，保障一切政党的行动自由；取消对政治犯的一切判决；保障平等的选举权；建立物价管制并取消掠夺性的捐税；废除封建地主的土地所有权制度。印度的工人阶级为争取和平与切身利益的斗争正在日益加强和扩展。
  英国乞求美元被拒
    美国副国务卿韦伯通知英国大使佛朗克斯说：国务院不愿意要求国会提供“自由美元”给英国作为保护其经济不受军备需求的影响之用。纽约时报驻伦敦记者威尔斯说：英国、比利时或葡萄牙不再能得到美元的事实引起了伦敦方面的焦虑。这就是仆从国的悲哀。
