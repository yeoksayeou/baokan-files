    The "Provisional Rules for the Leasing of Private Houses in Beijing" should be appropriately revised based on the principle of mutual benefit for landlords and tenants

    To the Editorial Board:

    We are several industrialists and businessmen in Beijing. We have some opinions regarding the housing rental issue in this city:

    In the "Provisional Rules for the Leasing of Private Houses in Beijing," there is a provision that when the landlord reclaims the house, the tenant is not allowed to demand "moving expenses." However, there are no restrictions on some landlords irrationally collecting half a year or even a year's rent and other fees from tenants at once. Therefore, some landlords, in order to collect high rents, use excuses such as "for personal use," "selling the house," or "reconstructing the house" to force tenants to move out. This situation has already caused housing difficulties for many citizens, and we industrialists and businessmen are even more distressed. Several shops and factories, under the correct industrial and commercial policies of the People's Government, were developing well, but suddenly received notices from landlords to reclaim their houses. Industrial and commercial households face many difficulties, whether it's unloading goods, relocating equipment, or finding other housing. Some shops and factories have been forced to close down as a result.

    Therefore, we suggest that the Beijing Municipal People's Government should make appropriate revisions to the "Provisional Rules for the Leasing of Private Houses in Beijing" so that both legitimate property rights and legitimate leasehold rights are duly protected.
                                            Zhen Zhi  Qiao Tie

### 应以房主房客两利为原则  适当修正北京市私有房屋租赁暂行规则

    应以房主房客两利为原则
    适当修正北京市私有房屋租赁暂行规则编辑同志：
    我们是北京市的几个工商业者。我们对于本市房屋租赁问题有一些意见：
    北京市私有房屋租赁暂行规则中，有房主收房时，房客不得索取“搬家费”的规定；但对部分房主向房客一次收半年甚至一年房租和其他费用的不合理事情，却没有限制。因此有些房主为着收取高价房租，就借口“自用”、“卖房”或“改建房屋”，撵房客搬家。这种情形，已经造成很多市民住房的困难，我们工商业户更感到苦恼。有好几家商店和工厂，在人民政府正确的工商业政策下，正得到很好的发展时，突然接到房主收房的通知。工商业户无论装卸货物，迁移设备，另找房屋都有许多困难。有的商店和工厂已经因此而被迫歇业。
    因此，我们建议：北京市人民政府应将北京市私有房屋租赁暂行规则作适当的修正，以使合法的房屋所有权和正当的租赁使用权都得到应有的保护。
