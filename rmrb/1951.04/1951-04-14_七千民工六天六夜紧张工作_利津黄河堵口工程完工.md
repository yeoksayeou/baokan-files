　　Seven Thousand Workers Work Tirelessly for Six Days and Nights
    Completion of the Dike Closure Project at Lijin Yellow River
    The dike closure project at Wangjiazhuang, Lijin County, Shandong Province, was successfully completed at 9:00 AM on April 7th. The Yellow River dike at this location breached on February 3rd due to ice jam flooding. At that time, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and relevant parties immediately formed a dike closure committee and actively prepared for the closure work. The closure project began on April 1st. After six days and six nights of intensive work by seven thousand workers, it was successfully completed on the morning of April 7th. The local workers along the river are now engaged in the work of raising and reinforcing the dikes at the breach closure site.
