　　All-China Federation of Cooperatives Directs Local Cooperatives
　　Actively Develop Business and Vigorously Cooperate with Spring Plowing
    The All-China Federation of Cooperatives has issued instructions on cooperatives cooperating with spring plowing to develop business. The main points are as follows:
    First, rural grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in all regions should, under the leadership of the local CCP committee and the people's government, combine the supply of spring production materials with publicity for the patriotic production increase movement and explanations of the people's government's production increase policies to enhance farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production. In the work of providing fertilizer loans and pre-purchasing cash crops such as cotton, tobacco, hemp, sugar (sugar cane, sugar beets), and tea, educate farmers to recognize the importance of increasing the production of industrial raw materials and publicize and explain the price ratios of cotton and grain, hemp and grain, and tobacco and grain to increase farmers' confidence and interest in increasing the production of cash crops, and call on and guide members to take the lead in planting the above-mentioned crops, thereby increasing the political influence of cooperatives and members in the rural production movement.
    Second, the supply of production materials this spring, in the inland areas, should first focus on the timely supply of fertilizer. For fertilizers purchased by cooperatives using state fertilizer loans, in areas where spot sales are possible, in addition to selling them to members at preferential prices, they should be vigorously promoted to non-member farmers at prices not higher than or slightly lower than market prices. In cases where members or farmers are unable to purchase, it is necessary to actively organize fertilizer loans and pre-purchase products, and it is essential to fully meet the needs of members and take care of the needs of non-member farmers during the fertilizer sales season to ensure the completion of this year's fertilizer loan task. The second is to assist members in adding and repairing farm tools, and to promote new types of farm tools. Rural grassroots cooperatives, where financial conditions permit, should prepare a batch of farm tools for members in a planned manner. If non-members have requests, the cooperative can also purchase some farm tools for them within its capacity. County cooperatives should allocate some funds and set up temporary mobile farm tool repair stations in conjunction with key grassroots cooperatives. Their task is to repair members' farm tools, and they can also take care of the needs of non-member farmers within their capacity. These measures do not violate the basic policy of serving members, and they have positive significance for the completion of the entire production increase task. In the work of promoting and trying out new types of agricultural tools suitable for the local area, cooperatives and members should become active promoters and organizers, and first call on members to try out new types of agricultural tools. Again, it is necessary to focus on economic crops, promote the transfer of fine seeds, and vigorously purchase and promote the use of pesticides. At the same time, members should be educated to cherish draught animals and assist farmers in eradicating animal epidemics.
    Third, the sales of surplus grain and local products should be strengthened. Especially during the farmers' sowing season, according to the agreement between the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, pre-purchase contracts for cotton, hemp, tobacco, etc. should be signed with members to dispel farmers' concerns about not being able to sell and worrying about unreasonable prices, and strive to sign contracts with members to pre-purchase most of the cotton, hemp, tobacco and other cash crops they produce.
    Fourth, in order to ensure the sufficient supply of industrial raw materials for national economic construction, all work of the cooperative, especially fertilizer supply, rectification, establishment, and pre-purchase of products, should focus on areas that produce cash crops such as cotton, hemp, tobacco, sugar (sugar cane, sugar beets), and tea.

　　全国合作总社指示各地合作社
　  积极开展业务大力配合春耕
    中华全国合作社联合总社发出关于合作社配合春耕展开业务的指示，其要点如下：
    第一、各地农村基层供销合作社，应在当地中共党委及人民政府的领导下，结合春季生产资料的供应业务，向社员及广大农民进行爱国增产运动的宣传和人民政府增产政策的解释，以提高农民增产的情绪。在贷放肥料，进行预购棉、烟、麻、糖（甘蔗、糖萝卜）、茶等经济作物的工作中，教育农民认识增产工业原料的重要性和宣传解释棉粮、麻粮、烟粮比价，提高农民增产经济作物的信心和兴趣，并号召和引导社员在种植上述作物中起带头作用，借以提高合作社及社员在农村生产运动中的政治影响。
    第二、今春生产资料的供应业务，在关内各地区，首先着重于及时供应肥料。合作社使用国家肥料贷款采购的肥料，凡可能进行现售的地区，除按优待价格卖给社员外，应在不高于市价或稍低于市价的原则下，大力向非社员农民推销，在社员或农民无力购买的情况下，则须积极组织贷肥和预购产品的工作，务须于销肥季节内，充分满足社员需要及照顾非社员农民需要，保证今年肥料贷款任务的完成。其次是协助社员添补、修建农具，和推广新式农具。农村基层社在资金条件允许的情况下，应有计划地为社员准备一批农具。非社员如有要求，合作社在能力范围内也可以为他们代购部分农具。各县合作社应抽调部分资金，结合重点基层社设立临时性的流动农具修理站，其任务是以修补社员农具为主，在能力所及的条件下，也可照顾非社员农民的需要。这些措施，并不违反为社员服务的基本方针，并且对整个增产任务的完成，是有其积极意义的。在推广试用适合本地的新式农具的工作中，合作社及社员应成为积极的宣传者和组织者，并首先号召社员试用新式农具。再次，要着重在经济作物方面，推广调剂优良种子，大力采购和提倡使用农药。同时应教育社员爱护耕畜，协助农民扑灭畜疫。
    第三、应加强余粮及土产的推销业务，特别是在农民播种期间，根据中央人民政府贸易部与全国合作总社的协议书，向社员订立棉、麻、烟等预购合同，解除农民怕卖不出及耽心价格不合理的顾虑，争取和社员订立预购他们所生产的大部分棉、麻、烟等经济作物的合同。
    第四、为了保证国家经济建设中工业原料的充分供应，合作社各项工作，特别是供肥、整社、建社、预购产品等，都应以生产棉、麻、烟、糖（甘蔗、糖萝卜）、茶等经济作物的地区为重点。
