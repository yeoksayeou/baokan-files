　　US Imperialism Violates International Resolutions
　　Uses Japanese Bombs to Bomb Our Northeast
    Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: On March 30th, at 12:00, American invading aircraft bombed Ji'an County in Northeast China, using Japanese-made bombs to massacre our people. After the bombing in Ji'an, Zhang Shuchun, a railway worker in Northeast China, found a bomb igniter near the bomb crater, with the characters "昭十八ワ" (meaning 1943) on it, and a character "阪" below, proving that the bomb used by the American aircraft was a product made by Japan during World War II. This action by US imperialism is a complete violation of international agreements. According to the "Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan" promulgated by the Far Eastern Commission on June 20, 1947, and the resolution "Prohibition of Japanese Military Activities and Disposal of Japanese Military Equipment" passed on February 13, 1948, all Japanese weapons and ammunition should be destroyed by the Allied countries. The US government not only did not destroy Japanese weapons and ammunition, but also openly used them to massacre the Chinese people. This shameless crime of US imperialism should arouse the attention of just public opinion all over the world. (Attached picture)

　　美帝国主义违反国际决议
　  竟用日本炸弹轰炸我东北
    【新华社二十四日讯】美国侵朝飞机于三月三十日十二时轰炸我东北辑安县时，竟使用日本制造之炸弹屠杀我国人民。在辑安被炸后，东北铁路工人张树春在弹坑附近拾得炸弹引火帽一个，上有“昭十八ワ”（按即一九四三年）字样，其下并有一“阪”字，证明美国飞机使用之此项炸弹为日本在第二次世界大战期间的制品。美帝国主义这一行动，是完全违反国际协议的。按照远东委员会于一九四七年六月二十日所公布的“对日基本政策”和于一九四八年二月十三日所通过的“禁止日本军事活动及处置日本军事设备”的决议的规定，日本的一切武器弹药应由盟国予以销毁，美国政府不但不将日本武器弹药销毁，而且公然使用它来屠杀中国人民。美帝国主义这种无耻罪行，应当唤起全世界正义舆论的注意。（附图片）
