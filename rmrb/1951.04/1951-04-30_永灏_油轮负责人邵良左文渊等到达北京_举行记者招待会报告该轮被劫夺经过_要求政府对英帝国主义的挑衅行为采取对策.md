Xinhua News Agency, April 29th—Shao Liang, representative of the China Tanker Company in Hong Kong and director of the temporary supervision office for the "Yonghao" tanker, along with Zuo Wenyuan, captain of the "Yonghao" tanker, Zhou Yanjin, the vessel's chief engineer, and Huang Yuanxin, director of the maritime workers' union, arrived in Beijing from Guangzhou on April 26th. Yang Yitang, director of the General Office of the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government, Yu Mei, deputy director of the Navigation Bureau, Wang Bingnan, deputy general manager of the China Tanker Company, and Li Dalin, secretary-general of the Preparatory Committee of the China Seamen's Union, personally welcomed them at the train station. Shao Liang, Zuo Wenyuan, and others are in Beijing to report to the Central People's Government on the armed seizure of our "Yonghao" tanker by the British Hong Kong government. On the 27th, the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government held a welcoming ceremony for them. The Preparatory Committee of the China Seamen's Union, the Navigation Bureau, and other units also held gatherings to express their warm condolences.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 29th—Representatives of the employees of our "Yonghao" tanker, which was unreasonably seized by the British Hong Kong government, held a press conference in Beijing today to report on the illegal seizure of the vessel by the British Hong Kong government and the struggle of the vessel's employees to protect their property against imperialism. At the conference, Shao Liang, director of the Yonghao tanker supervision office, spoke first, saying: "The Yonghao tanker, originally belonging to the former state-run Shanghai China Tanker Company, was entrusted to the British-owned Whampoa Dockyard in Hong Kong for repairs in July 1948. On April 1, 1950, all the vessel's employees declared an uprising, broke away from the Taiwan remnants, and returned to the embrace of the people's motherland. On June 29th, it was accepted by the Shanghai China Tanker Company, under the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government. However, the British-owned Whampoa Dockyard, taking advantage of the vessel's imminent completion of repairs, and under the covert instigation of American and British imperialism, colluded with the Taiwan remnants to file a lawsuit in the Hong Kong court, attempting to create a so-called issue of tanker property rights and seize the property of our People's Republic of China. On March 11th of this year, we exercised our rights as shipowners, notified the shipyard, and had the vessel towed away from the Whampoa Dock by the vessel's employees. On March 21st, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the "Yonghao" tanker's agent in Hong Kong, went to the Hong Kong Marine Department to complete customs clearance, engaging in negotiations more than ten times. The Hong Kong Marine Department made various excuses, created all sorts of difficulties, and obstructed the vessel's return to the country. All the certificates were submitted by April 4th, but the Hong Kong Marine Department still delayed signing and releasing the vessel. On the 7th, the British Hong Kong government suddenly ordered the 'requisition' of our Yonghao tanker and dispatched steamers to monitor it day and night. On the 12th, the British Hong Kong government resorted to violence to forcibly seize the vessel, rudely tearing down our national flag and coercing all the crew members to leave the ship. The British government has thus exposed its consistent two-faced policy. All the employees of our Yonghao tanker are extremely indignant at this shameless piratical act of seizing our national property and unanimously stated that it cannot be tolerated." Subsequently, Captain Zuo Wenyuan delivered a speech, representing all the crew members of the Yonghao tanker in demanding that the Central People's Government take necessary measures against this provocative act by British imperialists. He said: "The Yonghao tanker has a deadweight of 15,000 tons, is 525 English feet long and 60 English feet wide, and has a speed of 16 knots. It is one of the largest oil tankers in our country. British imperialism has coveted it for a long time. For two years and nine months, they have continuously adopted various despicable means, such as colluding with American imperialism and the Taiwan remnants to buy off, lure, send special agents to sabotage, create legal disputes, and create difficulties, in an attempt to seize the Yonghao tanker for themselves. In the end, they openly robbed our national property by force in order to curry favor with American imperialism and its running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek gang. All the employees of our Yonghao tanker want to accuse British imperialism's atrocities to the people of the whole country and demand that the Central People's Government take countermeasures." Finally, Huang Yuanxin, director of the Yonghao Tanker Seamen's Union, reported on the heroic struggle of the vessel's sixty crew members, who had been united from beginning to end in protecting the vessel, and expressed that the crew members will take practical action in resisting America and aiding Korea to protest the shameless provocative actions of imperialism.

    【新华社二十九日讯】被香港英国政府无理劫夺的我国“永灏”号油轮员工来北京代表，今日举行记者招待会，报告该轮被香港英国政府非法夺占及该轮员工反帝护产斗争的经过情形。会上，首由永灏轮监工处主任邵良讲话，他说：“原属前国营上海中国油轮公司的永灏轮，系于一九四八年七月交托香港英商黄埔船厂修理。一九五○年四月一日该轮全体员工宣告起义，脱离台湾残匪，返回人民祖国怀抱。六月二十九日由中央人民政府交通部所属上海中国油轮公司予以接受。而修理永灏轮的英商黄埔船厂乘该轮行将修竣之时，不遵照合同办理，竟在美、英帝国主义暗地指使下，勾结台湾残匪向香港法院提出诉讼，企图制造所谓油轮产权问题，夺取我中华人民共和国之财产，我方于今年三月十一日遂行使船东职权，一面通知该船厂，一面由该轮员工将船拖离黄埔船坞。三月二十一日永灏轮在香港代理人招商局前往香港海事处结关，交涉十多次，香港海事处借口需要各种证书，百般刁难、阻挠该轮返国。至四月四日全部证书交齐，香港海事处仍拖延不予签放。七日，香港英国政府突然下令“征用”并派遣汽船昼夜监视我永灏轮。至十二日香港英国政府竟施暴力强夺该轮，无礼地扯下我国国旗，胁逼全体船员离船。英国政府就这样自己戳穿了它一贯要弄着的两面政策。我们永灏轮全体员工对此无耻强夺我国财产的海盗行为，极为愤慨，一致表示绝不能容忍。”接着，左文渊船长发表谈话，他代表永灏轮全体船员要求中央人民政府对英帝国主义者这一挑衅行为，采取必要的措施。他说：永灏轮载重一万五千吨，船身长五百二十五英英尺，宽六十英尺，时速十六海里，是我国最大的油船之一，英帝国主义唾涎已久，两年零九个月以来，曾勾结美帝国主义及台湾残匪不断采取收买、利诱、派特务破坏、制造法律纠纷、留难等各种卑鄙手段，企图夺永灏轮为己有。最后竟公然以武力抢夺我国财产，以献媚美帝国主义及其走狗蒋匪帮。我们永灏轮全体员工要向全国人民控诉英帝国主义的暴行，并且要求中央人民政府采取对策。最后，永灏轮船员工会主任黄元信报告该轮六十位船员自始至终团结一致进行了英勇的护产斗争情形，并表示船员们今后将以积极抗美援朝的实际行动，抗议帝国主义的无耻挑衅行为。
