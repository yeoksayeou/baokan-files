All male and female workers and staff comrades across the country:
    The great May Day Labor Day is approaching.

    This year's May Day Labor Day is a day for working people around the world to unite against imperialist aggression, defend world peace, and review their fighting strength. On this May Day, the Chinese people will hold patriotic demonstrations against American aggression and support for Korea in all cities and villages across the country. We call on all male and female workers and staff to participate in the May Day parade!

    As everyone knows, the purpose of American imperialism's aggression against Korea is to invade China. Unless we completely crush the American aggression against Korea and China, our national defense cannot be consolidated, and we cannot peacefully carry out the cause of building a new China. Now, after suffering several defeats, the United States wants to independently conclude peace with Japan, arm Japan, and continue to expand its war of aggression. Workers! In order to express our determination to oppose the United States arming Japan and unilaterally concluding peace with Japan, and to express our determination to support the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in thoroughly defeating the American aggressors, everyone should participate in the May Day parade!

    The World Peace Council recently made a resolution and issued a declaration: resolutely oppose wars of aggression, defend world peace, and demand that the five major powers, China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, conclude a peace pact. This is the common and just demand of the people of the world. Workers! In order to express our support for the resolutions and declarations of the World Peace Council, and to express our determination to defend world peace, everyone should participate in the May Day parade!

    As everyone knows, American imperialism is not only attempting to invade us from the outside, but also continues to support the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and collude with and buy off all kinds of counter-revolutionaries to undermine us from within. Therefore, counter-revolutionaries are enemies hidden within us. We want to defend the motherland; they are willing to betray the motherland and be slaves of imperialism. We want to resist America and aid Korea; they create trouble in the rear. We want to develop production and prosper the economy; they sabotage factories, burn warehouses, and cause significant damage to people's property. If we do not resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, we cannot consolidate our people's democratic government and protect our victorious achievements. Workers! In order to express our support for the government's determination to suppress counter-revolutionaries, everyone should participate in the May Day parade!

    As everyone knows, since last winter, in vast areas, peasant masses, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have carried out a vigorous land reform struggle. Up to now, 130 million peasant brothers have overthrown the landlords who cruelly exploited them and have been allocated land. This winter, land reform will continue in regions with a population of over 100 million. This is a major event that fundamentally destroys feudal forces, not only liberating the peasants but also liberating the entire Chinese people. Workers! In order to express our support for land reform and solidarity with the peasants, and our determination to completely eliminate feudal forces, everyone should participate in the May Day parade!

    Workers! Our Central People's Government leads the people of the whole country to struggle for the construction of a new democratic New China, and has achieved great victories in all aspects. In the military field, it has unified all territories except Taiwan and Tibet, and has basically eliminated bandits throughout the country. In foreign policy, it has concluded the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, consolidated the strength of the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, and eliminated and is eliminating imperialist influence within China. In fiscal policy, it has stabilized prices and stopped the inflation that caused prolonged suffering to the broad masses of working people. In agriculture, it has built water conservancy projects, reduced floods, and striven for bumper harvests. In industry and transportation, it has restored more than 20,000 miles of railway traffic, restored factories and mines destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit gang, and enabled many unemployed workers to find jobs. In protecting labor, it has promulgated the Trade Union Law and the Labor Insurance Regulations, provided relief to unemployed workers, and established many welfare undertakings, which have improved the material and cultural lives of our workers. In the short period of just over a year and a half since the establishment of the Central People's Government, all aspects of our People's China have shown a new atmosphere, and the Chinese people have truly stood up. Workers! In order to express our support for the Central People's Government, the Chinese Communist Party, and our beloved Chairman Mao, everyone should participate in the May Day parade!

    All male and female workers and staff comrades across the country! The struggle against imperialist aggression, to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, and to consolidate our people's government is a long-term struggle. The cause of building our new democratic country is an even longer-term task. We must implement the firm will and fighting spirit demonstrated in this demonstration into our regular work.

    We must continuously improve our class consciousness in the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea, and in our regular study of current affairs and politics!

    We must redouble our vigilance, protect factories and enterprises, and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries!

    We must resolutely support land reform and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance!

    We must more widely develop and persist in patriotic labor competitions, and strive for continuous improvement in labor productivity!

    We must resolutely implement the Trade Union Law and do a good job in trade union work!

    Long live the great May Day Labor Day!

    Working people of the world, unite to oppose warmongers and defend world peace!

    The Chinese people unite, persist in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors!

    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the Chinese Communist Party, which leads the Chinese working class and all the people to liberation!

    Long live Chairman Mao, the great and wise leader of the Chinese people!

　　全国总工会为动员全国工人职员参加五一大示威的号召全国男女工人、职员同志们：
    伟大的“五一”劳动节就要来到了。
    今年的“五一”劳动节是全世界劳动人民团结反对帝国主义侵略，保卫世界和平，检阅自己战斗力量的日子。中国人民在今年“五一”这一天，要在全国所有城市乡村举行抗美援朝的爱国大示威。我们号召全国男女工人、职员们，大家都去参加“五一”大示威！
    大家知道：美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，就是为了侵略中国；不最后粉碎美国对于朝鲜和中国的侵略，我们的国防就不能巩固，我们就不能够安稳地进行建设新中国的事业。现在美国遭受几次失败后又要单独对日媾和，武装日本，继续扩大侵略战争。工友们！为了表示我们反对美国武装日本与单独对日媾和的决心，为了表示我们支援朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿部队，彻底打败美国侵略者的决心，大家都去参加“五一”大示威！
    世界和平理事会不久以前做了决议，发了宣言：坚决反对侵略战争，保卫世界和平，要求中、苏、美、英、法五大国缔结和平公约，这是全世界人民共同的正义要求。工友们！为了表示我们拥护世界和平理事会的决议和宣言，表示我们保卫世界和平的决心，大家都去参加“五一”大示威！
    大家知道：美帝国主义不只是企图从外部来侵略我们，而且继续扶持蒋介石匪帮，勾结收买各种反革命分子，从内部来破坏我们。所以反革命分子是隐藏在我们内部的敌人。我们要保卫祖国；他们就甘心背叛祖国，做帝国主义的奴才。我们要抗美援朝；他们就在后方捣乱。我们要发展生产，繁荣经济；他们就破坏工厂，焚烧仓库，使人民财产遭受重大损害。如果不坚决镇压反革命，就不能巩固我们的人民民主政权，保护我们的胜利果实。工友们！为了表示我们拥护政府镇压反革命的决心，大家都去参加“五一”大示威！
    大家知道：从去年冬季起，有广大地区的农民群众，在中国共产党领导下进行了轰轰烈烈的土地改革斗争，到现在已有一亿三千万农民兄弟，打倒了残酷剥削他们的地主，分得了土地。今年冬季还有一亿以上人口的区域，要继续进行土地改革。这是一件根本摧毁封建势力，不仅使农民翻身，而且是使全中国人民翻身的大事。工友们！为了表示我们拥护土地改革与农民团结一致，彻底消灭封建势力的决心，大家都去参加“五一”大示威！
    工友们！我们中央人民政府领导全国人民为建设新民主主义的新中国而斗争，在各方面都获得了伟大的胜利。在军事方面统一了除台湾、西藏外的全部领土，基本上肃清了全国的土匪；在对外政策方面，缔结了中苏友好同盟互助条约，巩固了以苏联为首的世界和平阵营的力量，在中国境内肃清了并正在肃清着帝国主义的影响；在财政政策方面，稳定了物价，停止了使广大劳动人民感受长期痛苦的通货膨胀；在农业方面，兴修水利，减轻了水灾，争取了丰收；在工业交通方面，恢复了两万多里的铁路交通，恢复了被国民党匪帮破坏的工厂、矿山，使许多失业工人获得了工作；在保护劳动方面，颁布了工会法和劳动保险条例，救济了失业工人，兴办了许多福利事业，使我们工人的物质生活和文化生活都得到了改善。在中央人民政府成立以来不过一年半的短短时期中，我们人民中国的各方面都表现了新的气象，中国人民真正站起来了。工友们！为了表示我们拥护中央人民政府，拥护中国共产党，拥护我们亲爱的毛主席，大家都去参加“五一”大示威！
    全国男女工人、职员同志们！反对帝国主义侵略，肃清反革命，巩固我们人民政权的斗争是长期的斗争；建设我们新民主主义国家的事业，更是长期的任务，我们要把这次示威中所表现的坚强意志与战斗精神，贯彻到我们经常的工作中去。
    我们要在抗美援朝的爱国主义运动中，在经常的时事政治学习中，不断提高我们的阶级觉悟！
    我们要加倍提高警惕，保护工厂企业，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子！
    我们要坚决拥护土地改革，巩固工农联盟！
    我们要更广泛地开展与坚持爱国主义的劳动竞赛，为不断的提高劳动生产率而斗争！
    我们要坚决实行工会法，把工会工作做好！
    伟大的“五一”劳动节万岁！
    全世界劳动人民团结起来，反对战争贩子，保卫世界和平！
    全中国人民团结起来，坚持抗美援朝运动，彻底打败美国侵略者！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    领导中国工人阶级与全体人民解放的中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民伟大英明的领袖毛主席万岁！
