Xinhua News Agency, 13th: According to TASS, Canadian peace activists recently held a grand National Congress for the Defense of Peace in Toronto. The congress was attended by 2,658 delegates, with an additional 898 participating as corresponding delegates.

　　The congress discussed the fundamental issues of the Canadian peace movement. Representatives from various regions introduced the situation of the peace movement. Speakers unanimously talked about the urgent need to safeguard peace for all the people of Canada and expressed their belief in the inevitable victory of the forces of peace.

　　The congress then approved the declaration of the Second World Peace Congress as the main program of the Canadian peace movement and resolved to immediately launch a signature campaign to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact. The congress elected a National Council of the Canadian Congress for the Defense of Peace, headed by James Gareth Endicott.

　　At the closing of the congress, a city-wide assembly of peace supporters was held in Toronto. Many people, despite the deliberate obstruction of the police and driving away fascist thugs who were creating disturbances in front of the venue, participated in the assembly. Woodard, a member of the London Peace Defense Committee from the United Kingdom and a well-known member of the British Conservative Party, delivered a speech at the meeting. He condemned the American aggression against Korea and the colonial wars waged by imperialism against the people of the East.

　　Endicott spoke last. He emphasized that the United Nations had violated the fundamental principles of its charter and that a peace pact concluded by the five major powers was the best way to guarantee peace.

　　加和平大会决议发动签名运动
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社消息：加拿大和平战士日前在多伦多市举行了规模盛大的加拿大全国保卫和平大会。到会代表有二千六百五十八人，此外并有八百九十八人以通讯代表的资格参加了大会的工作。
    大会讨论了加拿大和平运动的基本问题。各地代表介绍了和平运动的情况。发言者一致谈到保障和平对于加拿大全体人民的迫切需要，并表示了确认和平力量必然胜利的信念。
    大会接着批准了以第二届世界和平大会的宣言为加拿大和平运动的主要纲领，并决议立即发动为要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言征集签名的运动。大会选出了以文幼章为首的加拿大保卫和平大会全国理事会。
    大会在闭幕时举行了多伦多全市和平拥护者大会。许多人民不顾警察的故意留难，赶走了在会场面前捣乱的法西斯暴徒，参加了大会。自英国前来参加大会的伦敦保卫和平委员会委员、英国著名的保守党党员伍达德在会上发表演说。他谴责美国对朝鲜的侵略和帝国主义对东方人民进行的殖民地战争。
    文幼章最后发言。他着重指出：联合国已经违背了宪章的基本原则，五大国缔结和平公约是保证和平的最好方法。
