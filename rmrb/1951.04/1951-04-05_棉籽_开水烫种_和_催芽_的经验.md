Experiences in "Scalding Cotton Seeds with Boiling Water" and "Germination"
        Ma Jueweng

Whether a cotton crop is bountiful depends primarily on whether the seedlings emerge uniformly. The most effective and easy method for ensuring cotton seedling survival is scalding the seeds with boiling water. Its advantages are as follows:

    I. Early and uniform emergence. Cotton seeds that have been scalded with boiling water will emerge completely within three days of emergence; this is five or six days earlier than dry planting, and three or four days earlier than soaking in cold water. When sowing is slightly delayed, using boiling water to scald the seeds can advance the emergence time.

    II. Can kill germs and pests. Germs of cotton diseases such as anthracnose and boll rot are mostly attached to the seeds. Cotton seeds are also a place where pink bollworms hide. Scalding with boiling water can kill all the germs and insects.

    III. Can avoid wind and drought. In dryland cotton planting, ensuring seedling survival is an extremely difficult task; especially in North China, the time of cotton sowing is a period of rampant wind. If a little carelessness is applied to the sowing technique, it is difficult to obtain neat seedlings. If boiling water is used to scald the seeds to promote early emergence, the surface soil dries, and the cotton seeds have already taken root and emerged from the soil, preventing the disadvantage of the seeds drying out (referred to by the locals as "being caught").

    IV. Can identify the quality and germination rate of seeds: The outer skin of cotton seeds has short lint (especially the large white seeds of American cotton), and it is usually difficult to see the quality of the seeds. After scalding and soaking, the unfilled seeds float to the top. At the same time, the maturity of the cotton seeds can be seen from the seed color, so the quality of the seeds can be determined and the amount of sowing can be determined. In addition, for new seeds purchased from outside, the germination rate can be determined after soaking and germination, making sowing more assured. Therefore, scalding seeds with boiling water is very beneficial for ensuring seedling survival and high yield, but to implement this work, it is necessary to master appropriate techniques. Now, some successful experiences in the cotton-growing areas of North China are introduced for reference.

The method of scalding seeds with boiling water is to first put the seeds in a vat, and pour boiling water into it. The amount of water should be enough to submerge the seeds. After adding water, immediately stir with a wooden stick to ensure uniformity from top to bottom. After stirring for four or five minutes, quickly put in cold water. The temperature of the water should be such that you feel it is not too hot when you put your hand in it (about 40 degrees Celsius). Soak like this for six to eight hours, then take the seeds out and put them in a basket to drain the water. Then put them in a bamboo basket or hemp bag, put them on a warm kang (heated platform), cover them with some hemp bags or cotton quilts for germination. Some people rub them with plant ash after taking them out, to make them loose and easy to sow, before putting them in the bamboo basket.

In order to sow according to the prescribed time, special attention should be paid to the management of germination work. If the sprouts are too long, the tips of the sprouts are easily damaged, reducing emergence, and sowing is also inconvenient. It is best to sow when the sprouts have just emerged. The main conditions for germination are the degree of water absorption of the seeds, and the temperature of the kang and the room. Generally speaking, the seeds have fully absorbed water after being scalded with boiling water and soaked for seven or eight hours. If you are eager to sow early, drain the water more thoroughly, make the kang and room temperature higher, and cover them thickly, the germination will be faster, but check frequently to avoid overheating, and add some warm or cold water if necessary. If you plan to sow later, the room temperature and the kang need to be adjusted appropriately. When sowing, if the weather is hot and dry, the sprouts will easily grow too long, so stir them often by hand and sprinkle some cold water.

The quality of the seeds is easy to see after soaking and germination. However, some seeds have their navel damaged when ginning, and hot water easily penetrates, so they germinate easily. This situation is not normal germination. In addition, the lint of American cotton seeds is relatively long, and the young buds are easily covered by the short lint, making them difficult to see. By the time the sprouts are seen, they are already too long, so it is necessary to check carefully. Look at the cracking of the navel of the cotton seeds, and tear off the short lint to see if the sprouts have grown. In addition, the sprouts of American cotton are thinner and more pointed than those of Chinese cotton, and are easily broken, so special care should be taken when sowing.

To master the germination technology, attention should also be paid to the following points:

    I. The relationship between the sowing period and the length of the sprouts. Generally speaking, if the sowing period is early (such as around Grain Rain), the shorter the sprouts, the better. But if the seeds are surely good and the soaking technique is skilled, it is also possible not to germinate them. If sown early, it is absolutely bad if the sprouts are too long. If sown late (such as after the Beginning of Summer), it does not matter if they are a little longer, because the weather is cold when sown early. If the roots and sprouts are a little longer but cannot quickly develop downwards, and the small leaves cannot emerge from the ground for a while, the roots and stems will form a curved state and cannot emerge from the soil, which the locals call "pán kē" (coiled nest). If the sprouts are short, the sprouts will temporarily stop growing when the weather is cold, and then take root and emerge from the soil when the weather is warm. When sowing around Small Fullness, most of the cotton seeds have not shed their shells and have already emerged from the soil, which the locals call "dǐng jiǎ" (topping armor), so it does not matter if they are a little longer when sown late, but the number of damaged seeds may be larger.

    II. The relationship between sowing depth and the length of the sprouts. Cotton sowing should be shallow rather than deep. If the weather is dry or there is a lack of rain in early spring, the lower part of the soil is wet and the surface layer has dry soil, then deep sowing is necessary. In this case, it is better for the sprouts to be shorter, because if the sprouts are long and enter the soil deeply, the seeds' ability to emerge from the soil is weak and they are prone to "pán kē". If sowing is shallow, and the time is after the Beginning of Summer, the sprouts can emerge earlier if they are longer.

    III. The relationship between soil moisture and the length of the sprouts. When sowing, if the soil is very wet, the sprouts should be short. If the soil is slightly dry, the sprouts can be longer, because emergence is slower when the soil is very wet, and long sprouts hinder emergence somewhat. If the soil is slightly dry and the weather is warm, the roots and stems will quickly grow downwards if the sprouts are a little longer, preventing the harm of the seeds drying out midway.

    IV. The relationship between soil sandiness/clayiness and the length of the sprouts. Generally, short sprouts are better for clayey soils, and slightly longer sprouts are acceptable for sandy soils, because clayey soil does not have as high a temperature as sandy soil, and emergence is slower. Clayey soil retains temperature better than sandy soil, so shorter sprouts are needed.

　　棉籽“开水烫种”和“催芽”的经验
    马矍翁
    棉花能否丰收，首先决定于出苗是否整齐。棉花保苗最有效而容易的方法，首推开水烫种。它的好处如下：
    一、出苗早而整齐。棉籽经开水烫种后，在出苗后三天内就可出齐；比干种的要早出苗五、六天，比冷水浸种的也早三、四日；在播种稍晚的时候，施用开水烫种能提早出苗的时间。
    二、可杀除病菌和虫害。棉病中的炭疽病，铃腐病等病菌多附着在种子上。棉子又是红铃虫藏匿的地方；施用开水烫种，可以把病菌和虫子全部消灭。
    三、可避免风旱。旱地植棉，捉苗是一件顶困难的工作；尤其在华北各地，棉花播种的时候正是狂风肆虐的时期，假使对播种技术稍不注意，很难获得整齐的苗子，若用开水烫种，促其提早出苗，表皮土壤干燥，而棉籽已生根出土，不至发生晒干籽（老乡叫赶上）的弊病。
    四、可鉴定种籽的好坏和发芽率：棉籽外皮有短绒（尤其是美棉的大白籽），平常很不容易看出种子的好坏，经过烫种浸种以后，不饱满的种子都浮到上面。同时从籽色也可看出棉籽的成熟程度，因此就可决定种子的好坏而确定下种量。还有新从外面购入的种子，经浸种发芽后，可决定他的发芽率，可使播种有把握。因此，开水烫种对保苗丰产是很有好处的，不过实行这一工作，必须要掌握适当的技术，现在介绍华北棉区一些成功的经验以供各地参考。
    开水烫种的方法是先把种子放在缸里，并把滚水倒进去，水量以能浸没种子为度。加水后立即用木棍搅拌，务使上下均匀，搅四五分钟后，赶紧放入冷水，水的温度，以手伸到水里感到不烫即可（约摄氏四十度），这样一直浸六小时至八小时，然后把种子捞出来放在筐里，把水漏去，再装入箥箩里或麻袋里，放在热炕上，盖上些麻袋或棉被，进行催芽；有的为了下种时的松散易播，捞出来后先用草木灰搓一下，再放进箥箩里去。
    为了按照规定时间播种，对于催芽工作的管理，需要特别注意。芽儿过长，容易碰坏芽尖，减少出苗，播种也不方便。最好是在芽刚露出时即播种。催芽的条件，主要在于种子吸水的程度，和炕与屋内的温度，一般地说，种子经开水烫过和七八个钟头的浸种后，已饱吸水分。假若急于早种，应把水漏干一些，炕和屋子温度高一些，盖的厚一些，出芽比较快，但要时常检查，不要过热，必要时加一些温水或冷水。如计划晚种一些时间，则对于室内温度和炕需适当调节，在播种的时候，如天气燥热，芽子很容易生长，应时常用手翻搅，并洒些冷水。
    种子的好坏，经浸种催芽后，很容易看出来。但有的在轧花的时候，棉籽脐部被碰伤的，热水容易浸入，也就很容易出芽，这种情形，不是正常的发芽。此外美棉的棉籽，短绒比较长，幼芽容易为短绒所遮护，不容易看出来，等到看到芽的时候，已经嫌长了，因此必需详细检查。看棉籽脐部崩裂情形，把短绒扯一下，就可看出是否已长芽；此外美国棉的芽比中国棉尖细，很容易碰断，在播种时应该特别小心。
    掌握催芽技术，还要注意到下列几点：
    一、播种期和芽长短的关系。一般地说如播种期早（如在谷雨前后），种籽出芽越短越好。但如种子保险是好的，浸种技术又熟练，不出芽也可以。早种时，芽出的长了绝对不好，晚种（如在立夏以后）则长一些没有多大关系，原因是早种天气冷，根芽要是长一些而不能迅速向下发展，小叶一时又不能长出地面，根茎会形成弯曲状态，而不能出土，老乡叫做“盘窠”，芽短的话，天气冷时芽即会暂时停止生长，天气温暖后即可扎根出土。晚种的时候，天气温度较高，芽很快就扎根出土。在小满左右播种时，多数棉籽尚未脱壳即已出土，老乡叫“顶甲”，所以晚种长一些没有什么关系，只是种籽损伤数可能大些。
    二、播种深浅和芽长短的关系。棉花播种本来是宜浅不宜深，假定天气干燥或早春缺雨，下部土湿而表层有干土，则非深播不可。在这情形下面，发芽要短一些才好，原因是芽长而入土深的话，种子出土能力弱，很容易“盘窠”。播种浅，时间在立夏后，芽长还可提早出苗。
    三、土壤干湿和芽长短的关系。在播种的时候，假如土壤很湿则芽宜短，土壤稍干则芽宜长，原因是土壤很湿出苗较慢，芽长对出苗有些妨碍，土壤稍干，天气再暖，芽儿长一些，则根茎很快向下生长，不至有中途干籽的弊害。
    四、土壤沙、黏和芽长短的关系。一般黏性土壤芽短些好，沙土稍长些还可以，原因是黏土没有沙土温度高，出苗慢一些，而黏土保持温度比沙土强，因此黏土需要短些好。
