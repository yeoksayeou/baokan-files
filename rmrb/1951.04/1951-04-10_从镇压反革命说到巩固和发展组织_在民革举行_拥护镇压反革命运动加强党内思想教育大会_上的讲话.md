From Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries to Consolidating and Developing the Organization
　　-- Speech at the Min革 "Support the Movement to Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries and Strengthen Ideological Education within the Party Conference"
　　Wang Kunlun, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
  I. Analysis of Several Erroneous Ideas Regarding the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries
 　(1) Adopting a Negligent and Bystander Attitude Towards Counter-Revolutionaries
    Some people adopt a negligent and bystander attitude towards counter-revolutionary activities, believing that this is not a serious problem. They say that the People's Liberation War has been won, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang of millions of troops has been completely defeated, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea has also been winning victories. What major events can a small group of counter-revolutionary elements within the country accomplish? Why make such a fuss? Some people also feel that suppressing counter-revolutionaries is the government's business. The government should handle it, and our support is enough. Just considering the support alone is not wrong, but this negligent and bystander attitude does not regard the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as a common political task of the Chinese people; nor does it see this as a matter of personal interest and an active action that everyone should take; even less does it see this as a serious life-and-death struggle with the enemy; and especially it does not see this as part of the decisive battle in the world between the two major camps.
    Everyone knows that today the world is divided into two camps. One is the peaceful, democratic, and progressive people's camp, and the other is the aggressive, reactionary, imperialist, and feudal remnant camp. The struggle between these two camps is now approaching the final reckoning. At this stage, China's struggle is manifested in the three major events of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. If we do not resist US aggression and aid Korea, and allow the US imperialist invading army to enter China, if land reform cannot be implemented, and if counter-revolutionary activities are not suppressed, can we even imagine what China's situation would be? Of course, only when we overthrow US imperialism will we essentially settle the score. But now there are still spies, vanguards, and feudal remnants of the landlord class sent by the US and Chiang Kai-shek on the Chinese mainland, who can be relied upon by the US and Chiang Kai-shek. The more victorious we are, the more they hate us; the more we build, the more they want to sabotage and overthrow our regime, plotting a restoration. Therefore, the three major events are fundamentally linked to the class struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. Victory and failure are both comprehensive. If we do not suppress counter-revolutionaries, they will become internal collaborators with the US and Chiang Kai-shek and overthrow our regime, just as Chairman Mao said: "The revolution will fail, the people will suffer, and the country will perish."
    When Chiang Kai-shek's bandit regime collapsed, the social foundation of counter-revolutionary elements in China was not completely destroyed: Taiwan is still occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, the feudal remnants of the landlord class have not been eliminated, and the conspiracy of US imperialism is even more sinister. They will not willingly accept death and are doing everything possible to carry out activities. Our apathy, arrogance, underestimation of the enemy, and excessively lenient tendencies have condoned them and fueled their arrogance. In the past year or more, there have been many examples of sabotage by secret agents and bandits in the country, which need not be listed. Recently, secret agents set fire to Lingling City in Hunan, causing losses to the people of more than 15.9 billion. Last year, on National Day, bandits妄想to炮打Tiananmen. Comrades, think about how serious this is? They are organized, have weapons, have plans, and have backers, but we do not have a clear understanding, underestimate them, and still say that secret agents cannot do anything. Comrades! You must know that this is a life-and-death struggle!
    (2) Benevolent Viewpoints, Unilateral Leniency, Sentimentalism, and Blurred Thinking of Failing to Distinguish Between the Enemy and Ourselves.
    These blurred thoughts existed in some people in the past. They emphasized education and reform, advocated leniency, and stuck out their tongues when they heard about killing people. They only saw that we killed a few bandits and secret agents, but did not see how many cadres and people the bandits and secret agents killed; they did not see the various acts of arson, sabotage, and riots by the bandits and secret agents, which harmed the interests of how many people. People with this kind of blurred thinking are often entangled in all kinds of old feudal social relationships, are always sentimental, and only care about the interests and safety of a few people, regardless of the interests and safety of the majority of the people and the country. They do not know that leniency towards the enemy is cruelty towards the people. With such unclear distinctions between the enemy and ourselves, they cannot stand firm. If the enemy wants to use machine guns to call our names, should we still be lenient towards him? If those who should be killed are not killed, and the enemy is killed less, then the enemy will kill more of us. Then, if those who should be hated are not hated, then those who should be loved will not be loved. Should we give our feelings to the enemy instead of to our own people? Let's give our feelings to our own brothers! Comrades, can you not love the new country, the new regime, the fruits of victory, the happy life, the construction cause, and the bright future that we, the millions of people, cadres, and martyrs, have obtained through bloodshed and sacrifice? And can you not hate the cruel, brutal, and scheming enemy who wants to ruin your happiness and future again?
    (3) Erroneous Understanding of the Policy of Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries
    There are also the following types of unclear understanding of the policy:
    (1) Some people believe that the past was a policy of leniency, and now a strict policy has been adopted. In fact, our policy has always been a combination of suppression and leniency, which was clearly established in Article 7 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Some unilateral leniency in the past was a deviation on the part of the executors, which should be corrected now.
    (2) Others say that we deliberately relaxed our grip in the past, and now we are gradually tightening it, letting counter-revolutionary elements show their faces before cleaning them up. This is a tactic. In fact, this is precisely the enemy's thinking and should not be our thinking. Facts have proved that the reason why bandits and secret agents in various places have been so rampant is, of course, the inevitable attempt of the enemy, but it is also the result of some cadres' excessively lenient deviation in the implementation of policies.
    (3) Another question: "Will innocent people be wronged?" "Will it cause panic?" We say that the government has repeatedly warned that we must conduct investigations and studies in all aspects, and there must be solid evidence. Our people's regime's judicial handling is against "extorting confessions, believing in confessions, and relying on confessions," so of course it will not wrong innocent people. As for causing panic, who will panic? Counter-revolutionary elements. Well then, if counter-revolutionary elements panic, the people will not panic.
    (4) Some people proceed from a purely judicial point of view, believing that the promulgation of the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries is only an instruction to the judicial and public security departments, so as to serve as a criterion for sentencing. It is true that this regulation is a most necessary legal weapon, but it is obviously incorrect to completely set aside the political task and the people's stand.
    (5) Contrary to the above-mentioned ideas, there is also the idea of "killing them all without leaving a single one." They do not know that the revolution and counter-revolution are a long-term struggle, and they do not know that suppressing counter-revolutionaries is a long-term and complex task. Our policy has always been a combination of suppression and leniency, and counter-revolutionary elements must be dealt with according to the severity of their crimes. Of course, those who have committed heinous crimes should be killed. Even if it should be killed, those who should not be killed should not be killed, and those between killable and unkillable should not be killed either. Killing them all at once is both impossible and contrary to the policy.
    (4) Confusion between the United Front and the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries
    The purpose of the united front is to organize the four revolutionary classes and unite all revolutionary forces to fight against counter-revolutionaries. Expanding the united front means expanding the revolutionary ranks. The more people who should come in, the better, and not a single person who should not come in can be mixed in. Mixing in will destroy the organization and weaken the organization. Only by clearing out counter-revolutionary elements can the united front be consolidated. The more consolidated the united front, the clearer the boundaries, the more isolated the enemy, and the easier it will be to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements. Some people say that we are resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and the more people, the better. Landlords also used to be patriotic, so why not unite with them? If landlords can truly show patriotism through action today, we certainly welcome them, but they must first obey the land reform policy and fundamentally abandon the landlord class's position, otherwise they are still class enemies. The patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea is something that everyone in the country should participate in. Loving the country is the duty of every Chinese, but this does not mean joining the united front of the people's democratic revolution. We cannot confuse the anti-enemy struggle of suppressing counter-revolutionaries with expanding the united front.
  II. Issues of Consolidating and Developing the Min革 Itself
    (1) The Revolutionary Historical Tradition of the Min革
    The Min革 inherits the revolutionary spirit and revolutionary historical tradition of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. In the nearly 100-year history of China, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was the first to call for revolution. Mr. Zhongshan was influenced by the bourgeois revolutions in Europe and the United States, initiated the Tongmenghui, opposed the autocratic rule of the Qing Dynasty, and opposed the reformism of Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao who advocated constitutional monarchy. His political line was resolutely revolutionary, and the boundaries between revolution and counter-revolution were clearly defined. When Yuan Shikai stole the country, Mr. Zhongshan launched the Second Revolution and organized the Chinese Revolutionary Party, never compromising with the Northern Warlords and removing the compromising elements. Later, he used Guangdong as a base and launched several Northern Expeditions, but Chen Jiongming betrayed the revolution. Mr. Zhongshan never treated him leniently, and the boundaries were clear. In 1924, Mr. Zhongshan took Russia as his teacher, resolutely reorganized the Kuomintang, put forward the Three Great Policies, expelled reactionary elements and backward elements, recognized that the world was divided into two camps, and moved to the side of the workers and peasants. Both the political line and the organizational line were very clear. After Mr. Zhongshan's death, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, and the left-wing members of the Kuomintang resolutely opposed Chiang Kai-shek and resolutely resisted Japan, with clear boundaries between the enemy and ourselves. Chairman Li Jishen opposed Chiang Kai-shek and was once imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek, resolutely opposing Chiang Kai-shek to the end. Before and after the establishment of the Min革, many comrades secretly organized themselves under the reactionary regime, fought against counter-revolutionary forces, cooperated with the CCP, and accepted the CCP's leadership, with a correct political line and clear boundaries between the enemy and ourselves.
    From this, it can be seen that the essence of the Min革 organization is revolutionary. Without the revolutionary struggle against counter-revolutionaries, there would be no Min革 organization. The progressive members of the Kuomintang and the comrades of the Min革 were successively oppressed, persecuted, imprisoned, fled, and even killed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang. The martyrs Liao Zhongkai, Yang Xingfo, Yang Jie, and several other martyrs who were killed in Kunming and Chongqing before liberation are all well-known. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang hates us the most. In fact, our Min革 comrades carried out the overthrow of his reactionary rule under the influence of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, so of course the struggle with them was very sharp, and they must hate Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang the most. It is truly "either the enemy or us, either us or the enemy, deep hatred, irreconcilable." Without this spirit, it is not the Min革 organization; without this position, it is not inheriting Sun Yat-sen but inheriting Chiang Kai-shek.
    (2) The Boundaries between Revolution and Counter-Revolution Must Be Clearly Defined
    Our Min革 is one of the members of the united front, participating in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism under the leadership of the working class, participating in the People's Political Consultative Conference, participating in the formulation of the Common Program, and we have a share in the people's regime of New China, we are the masters. Our essence has nothing in common with the reactionaries, and we must be resolutely opposed to them. This must be affirmed first and foremost, without the slightest ambiguity. Whether others or ourselves, if we recognize that the Min革 is the tradition of the old Kuomintang, then we have not thoroughly negated the reactionary traditional relationship, and we have not clearly distinguished the boundary between us and the old Kuomintang, which is very wrong.
    However, comrades, even though the nature of the Min革 is that the boundaries between the enemy and ourselves are clear, in fact, not only do others still not have a clear understanding of us, but there are also bound to be members in our own organization who have blurred thinking. Some people only see the five characters "Chinese Kuomintang" above, and do not see the five characters below (Revolutionary Committee). Some of us also believe that the organizational task of the Min革 is only to return old Kuomintang members to the team, which means that he has not strictly distinguished the boundary between the revolutionary Min革 and Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary bandit gang. But everyone knows that, in essence, our Min革 is completely different from Chiang Kai-shek's old Kuomintang organization!
    In terms of political relations, the past anti-Chiang and anti-American movement was the first hurdle and the first test for the comrades of the Min革. We passed this hurdle and basically succeeded. But there are also a few individual elements who were very brave in opposing Chiang Kai-shek, but could not figure out how to oppose the United States. Coupled with the new tricks of Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi for a time, some were even shaken and finally fell behind. Land reform is the second hurdle. Many people inevitably have old feudal relationships, which are intertwined, and some therefore cannot correctly understand the land reform policy, and even sympathize with landlords. Some elements even oppose land reform, and we have expelled them from the party. This hurdle has not been completely passed. Now we are facing another severe test: suppressing counter-revolutionaries. As of the end of last month, a total of 55 people have been expelled from the party by organizations in various places (including 26 in Hubei, 10 in Beijing, 9 in Nanjing, 3 each in Shanghai and Jiangxi, and 1 each in Henan, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Ningxia), of which 76 percent were for political reasons. Some counter-revolutionary elements have infiltrated our party. How should we treat them? Some people say that there are bound to be bad elements in any party, organ, or organization, which is not a serious matter. If a big spy like Yang Shoude can actually infiltrate the Min革 and use it as a cover, and we still think that bandits and secret agents cannot do anything dangerous, then we are underestimating the enemy and numbing ourselves. It will be too late when he does something. The Beijing Municipal Branch expelled ten party members, some of whom were arrested and some were under surveillance. I heard that some people complained that the organization provided no guarantee for party members and did not try to rescue them. This kind of thinking completely loses its position. Anyone under surveillance has no civil rights, and of course cannot participate in democratic parties. Democratic parties are advanced organizations of various revolutionary classes. Their political awareness should be higher than that of the general public, their positions should be firmer, and their implementation of policies should be more active. Comrades, should the Min革 regard people under surveillance as development targets? Are people under surveillance qualified to be Min革 members? Some people introduce people with unclear political backgrounds and unknown origins into the party, and the organization does not approve it, and he still feels unhappy. He is not clear about the nature of the organization and the direction of organizational development, and only lingers on historical relationships or family and friends relationships, completely ignoring his responsibility to the party and to the united front. Why not put your feelings on protecting the organization, but on the relationship with certain individuals?
    (3) Consolidating the Organization and Developing the Organization
    The consolidation and development of the organization are inseparable. Therefore, our Second Plenary Session's resolution on developing the organization adopts the principle of combining development and consolidation. Without consolidation, there can be no development. If bad elements mix into the party, it will destroy unity, confuse the thinking of party members, and hinder the party's purity and progress. Outsiders will naturally be afraid and hesitate to move forward. Originally, good and bad things should not be put together. Why should someone with a clean identity come to stain themselves with mud? Therefore, if we do not clean out the bad elements and strictly prevent bad elements from mixing in, it will inevitably hinder the party's development prospects. Comrades! Do we want to develop? Yes, we want to develop. Will expelling bad elements affect development? Of course not. Because if the bad ones don't go, the good ones won't come; if feudal relationships are not severed, anti-feudal people won't come. We can develop ten or a hundred good elements by expelling one bad element. We open the door to progress by closing the feudal door. Cleaning out bad people is greatly beneficial to our development. Only with a strict organization and strong discipline can we create favorable conditions for developing party members. The Central Committee has a clear policy for developing and consolidating the organization. The Beijing Municipal Branch's expulsion of undesirable elements is in line with the action of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and is also a measure that is in line with the interests of the party. It is completely correct. But why are there still differences in understanding? This is not a problem with the nature of our organization and the direction of organizational development, but that the remnants of feudalism have not yet been eliminated today and are still surrounding us, and many incorrect ideas are influencing us, making it easy for some party members' thinking to become confused. US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, local tyrants and bullies, and all counter-revolutionary elements believe that the Min革 has an opportunity to take advantage of, and are doing everything possible day and night to exploit our loopholes and attack us. Comrades, don't think that some people are very humble and affectionate to us, and show a positive and progressive face. You must know that what is hidden inside is the enemy attacking us! He takes advantage of our weaknesses of being nostalgic, caring about face, being careless, and sentimentalism to infiltrate the party, not only destroying our party, but also destroying our country in the name of the party. Wang Youmei, a notorious local tyrant and landlord in Henan, once infiltrated the organization and was shot. Yang Shoude, a big secret agent in Beijing, was shot. Everyone in society knows this. They were originally enemies who infiltrated from the outside. If we still think that family scandals should not be made public, then should we hide the enemy's counter-revolutionary crimes against the country as scandals in our own family? Comrades, who are we responsible to? Should we be responsible to the people? It is our own mistake that the enemy took advantage of our loopholes due to negligence. We should not hide our shortcomings and be responsible to the people and to the party. Only by facing our mistakes, admitting our mistakes, correcting our mistakes, negating the past, affirming the future, speaking clearly, and distinguishing right from wrong can we stand up with confidence, throw away our burdens, and move forward lightly.
    (4) We Must Be As Pure As Jade and Hate Evil As We Hate Our Enemies
    It is a fact that a small number of comrades in the Min革 do not have enough understanding of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. It is a fact that counter-revolutionary elements have infiltrated our party. This shows that our organization still has shortcomings. But let me say it again, the organization of our Min革, in its essence, is revolutionary and has nothing in common with counter-revolutionaries. As long as we can accept the lessons of experience, raise our vigilance, we will not lose our confidence because of such shortcomings. We are undertaking a major task for the country and the people. We have the working class as our leading class, the new democracy as our leading ideology, the Common Program as our guide to action, the correct Central Committee resolutions as the guiding principles for consolidating and developing the organization, the majority of party members with progressive thinking and firm positions as our mass base, and a large number of progressive on-the-job civil servants as our development targets. Our future is bright and optimistic. The comrades of the Min革 have decades of rich revolutionary experience and a history of struggle in the past, and have shown their enthusiasm and exerted some efforts for the people's democratic dictatorship, the construction of the new country, the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the land reform, and the three major movements of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. The people value us, and the leading party values us. We also admit that we have done some things, and in the future, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, in the spirit of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's constant progress, we will continue to work hard to complete the construction of the new democracy and move towards the grand future of socialism. We should have this understanding, have this confidence, and neither be discouraged nor feel inferior. But at present, in the high tide of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, every comrade must get his thinking clear and stand firm. The most important thing is: first, we must be as pure as jade to ourselves and not let the mud of counter-revolutionaries stain us. Second, we must hate evil as we hate our enemies. Always remember that leniency towards the enemy is cruelty towards the people. Not fighting the wolf is letting the wolf eat people. When we find counter-revolutionary elements in our own family and friends, we must abandon sentimentality, cut off contact, and put righteousness before family. That is to say, to the people, "love them and want them to live"; to the enemy, "hate them and want them to die"!
    We should be clear-headed, serious in our attitude, correctly understand the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and seek the consolidation and development of our party. Comrades, be firm! Be active! Take action!

　　从镇压反革命说到巩固和发展组织
　  ——在民革举行“拥护镇压反革命运动加强党内思想教育大会”上的讲话
    中国国民党革命委员会中央宣传部部长　王昆仑
  一、对于镇压反革命的几种错误思想的分析
    （一）对于反革命抱着轻视和旁观的态度
    有些人对于反革命活动抱着轻视和旁观的态度，认为这不是严重问题。他们说人民解放战争胜利了，蒋匪帮几百万军队全被打垮了，抗美援朝也连获胜利，国内一小撮反革命分子还能做出什么大事？何必大惊小怪？还有人觉得镇压反革命是政府的事，政府去办，我们赞成就完了。单就赞成这一点说，不能算错；但这样轻视和旁观的态度，是没有把镇压反革命看作中国人民共同的政治任务；也没有看作这是每一个人自己切身利害的问题和自己应有的积极行动；更没有看作这是一个与敌人势不两立你死我活的严重斗争；尤其没有看作这是全世界两大阵营里决死斗争的一部分。
    谁都知道：今日一个世界划分两个阵营。一个是和平的、民主的、进步的人民阵营，一个却是侵略的、反动的、帝国主义的、封建残余的阵营。这两个阵营的斗争现在快要到最后结账的时候了。在现阶段中国的斗争就表现在抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命三件大事上。如果不抗美援朝，让美帝国主义侵略军队打进中国来，如果土地改革不能贯彻，如果反革命活动不镇压，中国的情况，我们还能想像吗？当然只有我们把美帝国主义打倒了，就基本结了账。可是现在中国大陆上还有美蒋派来的爪牙、尖兵以及可作美蒋凭借的地主阶级封建残余。我们越胜利，他们越仇恨；我们越建设，他们越要破坏，越要推翻我们的政权，阴谋复辟。所以三件大事基本联系在革命与反革命的阶级斗争上。胜利与失败都是整个的。不镇压反革命，他们就要做美蒋内应，推翻我们的政权，正如毛主席所说的：“革命就失败，人民就遭殃，国家就灭亡。”
    蒋匪帮政权垮了，反革命分子在中国的社会基础并未完全摧毁：台湾还被蒋匪帮盘据，地主封建残余还没有肃清，美帝国主义的阴谋更见毒辣。他们是不会甘心死亡的，正在千方百计地活动着。而我们的麻痹大意，骄傲轻敌，宽大无边的偏向就纵容了他们，助长了他们的气焰。一年余来特务匪徒们在国内的种种破坏，例证很多，勿庸列举。最近特务火烧湖南零陵城，人民损失达一百五十九亿之多。去年国庆节，匪徒妄想炮打天安门，同志们，想想严重不严重？他们有组织，有武器，有计划，有后台，而我们却认识不清，轻视他们，还说特务做不出什么。同志们！要知道这是一个你死我活势不两立的斗争！
    （二）仁慈观点，片面宽大，温情主义，敌我不分的模糊思想。
    这些模糊思想，过去有些人是存在着的。他们强调教育改造，主张宽大，听说杀人就伸舌头。只看见我们杀了少数土匪特务，没有看见土匪特务们杀了我们多少干部，多少人民；没有看见土匪特务们种种放火破坏暴动的事实，损害了多少人民的利益。有这种模糊思想的人，经常为一切旧的封建社会关系所牵连，处处温情；只顾少数人的利益安全，不管多数人民和国家的利益安全。他们不知道对敌人宽大，就是对人民残忍。这样敌我界限不清，自己立场就站不稳。敌人要用机关枪点我们的名，难道我们还应当对他宽大？该杀的不杀，少杀了敌人，就是让敌人多杀我们自己。那末，该恨的不恨，也就该爱的不爱了。难道应该把感情给了敌人不给自己的人民吗？还是把感情给自己的弟兄吧！同志们，我们千千万万的人民、干部，以及先烈们流血牺牲得来的新国家新政权，得来的胜利果实，幸福生活，建设事业和光明灿烂前途，难道你能不爱吗？而那残酷凶暴阴谋破坏的敌人要把你的幸福和前途重新断送，你能不恨吗？
    （三）对于镇压反革命政策的错误认识
    对于政策的认识不清也有如下的几种：
    （１）有人认为过去是宽大政策，而现在采取了严厉的政策。其实我们的政策一向是镇压与宽大相结合，在人民政协共同纲领第七条就已明白确定。过去有些片面宽大是执行者发生了偏差，现在应当加以纠正。
    （２）又有人说从前故意放松，现在步步加紧，让反革命分子露面后再来收拾，这是一种手段。其实这正是敌人的想法而不该是我们的想法。事实证明，各地土匪特务之所以能如此猖獗，固然是敌人必然的企图，也正是因为有些干部执行政策上发生宽大无边的偏差所引起的结果。
    （３）另一个问题：“会不会冤枉好人呢？”“会不会引起恐慌呢？”我们说，政府曾再三告诫，必须各方面地调查研究，必须有真凭实据。我们人民政权的司法处理是反对“逼、供、信”的，当然不会冤枉好人。至于引起恐慌，谁会恐慌呢？反革命分子。那末好了，反革命分子恐慌，人民就不恐慌了。
    （４）还有从纯司法观点出发的，以为惩治反革命条例的公布只是对司法公安部门的指示，以便作量刑的准绳。诚然这个条例是一种最必需的法律武器，但若把政治任务和人民立场完全撇开，这显然是不正确的。
    （５）与上述几种思想相反的，又有一种“斩尽杀绝一次杀光”的想法。他们不知革命与反革命是长期的斗争，不知镇压反革命是长期复杂的任务。我们的政策始终是镇压与宽大相结合，而对于反革命分子必须按其罪行轻重分别处理。罪大恶极的当然要杀，就是该杀的杀，不该杀的不杀，可杀与可不杀之间的也不杀。一次杀光既不可能，而且也违背政策的。
    （四）对统一战线与镇压反革命问题的混淆
    统一战线的目的是把革命的四个阶级组织起来，团结一切革命的力量向反革命斗争。扩大统一战线是扩大革命的阵容，应该进来的越多越好，不应该进来的一个也不能混入。混入进来就破坏了组织，削弱了组织。我们只有清除了反革命分子，统一战线才能巩固。统一战线越巩固，壁垒越分明，敌人越孤立，反革命分子才越易肃清。有人说我们抗美援朝，人越多越好，地主过去也有爱国的，为何不团结他？今天地主如真能以行动表示爱国，我们当然欢迎，但他必要先服从土地改革政策，根本放弃地主阶级的立场，否则仍然是阶级敌人。抗美援朝的爱国运动是全国每一个人都应该来参加的，爱国家是每一个中国人的义务，但这不等于加入人民民主革命的统一战线。不能把镇压反革命的对敌斗争与扩大统一战线混淆起来。
  二、民革本身巩固和发展组织的问题
    （一）民革的革命历史传统
    民革是承继孙中山先生的革命精神和革命历史传统的。在中国近百年史中，首先以革命号召的是孙中山先生。中山先生受了欧美资产阶级革命的影响，发起同盟会，反对满清专制，反对康梁保皇立宪的改良主义。他的政治路线是坚决革命的，革命与反革命界限划分得很清楚。袁世凯窃国，中山先生二次革命，组织中华革命党，对北洋军阀决不妥协，并把妥协分子清除出去。以后以广东为根据地，屡次北伐，而陈炯明叛变革命，中山先生对他决不宽大，界限分明。一九二四年中山先生以俄为师，毅然改组国民党，提出三大政策，开除反动分子与落后分子，认识世界分成两大壁垒，走向农工群众的一边。政治路线与组织路线都十分明确。到了中山先生死后，蒋介石叛变革命，国民党左翼分子坚决反蒋，坚决抗日，敌我界限分明。李济深主席反蒋，一度被蒋囚禁，坚决反蒋到底。民革成立前后，多少同志在反动政权下，秘密组织起来，与反革命势力斗争，与中共合作，接受中共领导，政治路线正确，敌我界限分明。
    由此可知，民革组织的本质是革命的。如果没有革命对反革命的斗争，就不会有民革组织的产生。国民党进步分子和民革同志们先后被蒋匪帮压迫、残害、坐监、逃亡，以至被杀的不知多少。廖仲凯、杨杏佛、杨杰诸先烈以及解放前在昆明、重庆被害的若干先烈，都是众所周知的。蒋匪帮对我们的仇恨最深，事实上我们民革同志是在蒋匪帮势力之下来进行推翻他的反动统治的，当然和他们的斗争非常尖锐，也必然对蒋匪帮的仇恨最深。真叫做“有敌无我，有我无敌，深仇大恨，不共戴天”。如无此精神，就不是民革的组织；如无此立场，就不是承继孙中山而是承继了蒋介石。
    （二）革命与反革命必须划清界限
    我们民革是统一战线成员之一，在工人阶级领导下参加反帝国主义反封建反官僚资本的斗争，参加人民政协，参加制定共同纲领，新中国的人民政权中，有我们一份，我们是主人。我们的本质和反动派不但毫无相同之处，而且必然是坚决敌对的。这必须首先肯定下来，不能丝毫模糊。无论别人或我们自己，若认民革是旧国民党的传统，那就没有彻底否定反动的传统关系，没有划清我们和旧国民党的界限，是非常错误的。
    然而，同志们，尽管民革的性质是敌我界限分明的，事实上不但别人对我们还认识不清，自己组织里也不免有思想模糊的分子。有些人只看见“中国国民党”上面五个字，看不见下面五个字（革命委员会）。我们自己当中也有人认为民革组织任务只是旧国民党员的归队，就是说他把革命的民革与反革命的蒋介石匪帮的界限并未严格分清。可是大家知道，实质上我们民革与蒋介石的旧国民党的组织，毫无相同之处！
    在政治关系上，过去反蒋反美运动是民革同志们的第一关，第一个考验。这一关我们过去了，基本上成功了。但也有个别少数分子反蒋很勇敢，反美就搞不清，加上李宗仁白崇禧一时的新花样，更有些摇动，终于落了伍。土地改革是第二关。不少的人不免带有旧的封建关系，千丝万缕地牵连着，有的因此对土地改革政策不能正确认识，甚至同情地主，有的分子竟反对土地改革，我们已把他们开除党籍。这一关还没有完全过去。现在又面临着镇压反革命——严重的考验。截至上月底止，各地组织开除党籍的共有五十五人（计湖北二十六人，北京十人，南京九人，上海江西各三人，河南、福建、浙江、宁夏各一人）其中百分之七十六为政治原因。我们党内钻入一些反革命分子，我们应当如何对待呢？有人说那个党派或机关团体内都不免有坏分子，不算严重。像杨守德那样大特务，居然混入民革，借作掩护，若还认为土匪特务做不出什么危险的事，那就未免轻视敌人，麻痹自己，等他做出事来，那就迟了。北京市分部开除了十个党员，其中有被捕和被管制的。听说有人埋怨组织对于党员毫无保障，也不设法营救。这种思想，完全丧失了立场。凡是被管制的分子就没有公民权，当然不能参加民主党派。民主党派是各革命阶级的先进组织，政治觉悟应该是比一般人民为高，立场更要坚定，执行政策更要积极。同志们，民革该把被管制的分子当作发展对象吗？被管制的分子有作民革党员的资格吗？有人把政治面目不清来历不明的分子介绍入党，组织不予通过，他还感觉不快。他对组织的性质和组织发展的方向都不清楚，只留恋历史关系或亲友关系，完全忽视了对党的责任，对统一战线的责任。为什么不把自己感情放在爱护组织上，而要放在某些个人的关系上啊？
    （三）巩固组织与发展组织
    组织的巩固与发展是不可分的。所以我们二中全会关于发展组织的决议是采取发展与巩固相结合的原则。不巩固也就决不能发展。如果党内混进坏的分子就会破坏团结，混淆党员的思想，妨害党的纯洁性与进步性。外面的人当然望而生畏，裹足不前。本来薰莸不同器，别人干干净净的身份，为什么要来沾染上些污泥？因此如不把坏分子清洗出去，不严防坏的分子混入进来，就必然障碍了党的发展前途。同志们！我们要不要发展？要发展。开除坏的分子会不会影响发展？当然不会。因为坏的不去，好的不来；封建关系不斩断，反封建的人不来。我们开除一个坏的分子出去，就可以发展十个百个好的分子进来。我们把封建的门关上，也就把进步的门打开。清除坏人，正是大有利于我们的发展。只有组织严密，纪律性强，才能创设了我们发展党员的有利条件。中央对于发展与巩固组织已有明确的方针。北京市分部开除不良分子，是符合镇压反革命的行动，也是符合党的利益的措施。完全正确。但是为什么还有认识上的分歧呢？这不是我们组织的性质和发展组织的方向发生问题，而是今天封建残余尚未肃清，还包围着我们，许多不正确的思想影响着我们，使有些党员的思想容易混乱。美蒋特务，地主恶霸，一切反革命分子认为民革有机可乘，正在千方百计不分昼夜地钻我们的空子，向我们进攻。同志们，不要看有些人对我们很谦恭，很亲热，表现一副积极进步的面貌，要知道那里面藏的正是向我们进攻的敌人啊！他利用我们念旧情、顾面子、麻痹大意，温情主义的弱点混进党来，不但破坏了我们的党，还假借党的名义破坏了我们的国家。河南一个著名的恶霸地主王友梅曾经混入组织被枪毙了，北京大特务杨守德被枪毙了，社会上都知道。他们本是从外面钻进来的敌人，如果还认为家丑不可外扬，那是否要把敌人对国家反革命的罪行当做自己家中的丑事而隐讳起来呢？同志们，我们到底对谁负责？该不该对人民负责？由于疏忽大意，被敌人钻了空子，是我们自己的错误；我们应该毫不掩饰自己的缺点向人民负责，向党负责。只有正视自己的错误，承认自己的错误，改正自己的错误，否定过去，肯定将来，把话说清楚，是非分明白，这样才能理直气壮地站起来，丢掉包袱，轻装前进。
    （四）我们要守身如玉嫉恶如仇
    民革有少数同志对于镇压反革命认识不够是事实。我们被反革命分子混进党来是事实。这都说明我们的组织还存在着缺点。然而再说一遍，我们民革的组织，按其本质来说是革命的，和反革命毫无相同之处，只要我们能接受经验教训，能提高警惕，我们不会由于这样的缺点丧失了信心。我们正担当着对国家人民重大的任务。有工人阶级作我们的领导阶级，有新民主主义作我们的领导思想，有共同纲领作行动指南，有正确的中央决议案作巩固与发展组织的方针，有大多数思想进步，立场坚定的党员作我们的群众基础，还有广大的进步的在职公务人员作我们的发展对象。我们的前途是光明的，乐观的。民革同志在过去有几十年革命的丰富经验和斗争历史，对人民民主专政，对新国家的建设，对抗美援朝、土地改革，和镇压反革命三大运动都表现了自己的热忱，尽了些力量，人民重视我们，领导党重视我们。我们也承认自己做了些事，今后还要在毛主席和共产党领导之下，本着孙中山先生不断前进的精神，继续努力完成新民主主义的建设，向着社会主义的远大前途迈进。我们应当有此认识，有此信心，并不自馁，也不自卑。但是目前在镇压反革命高潮中要每一个同志把思想搞通，立场站稳。最重要的是第一，对自己要守身如玉，不要让反革命的污泥沾染。第二，对敌人要嫉恶如仇。时常记着对敌人宽大就是对人民残忍。见狼不打，就是让狼吃人。遇到自己亲友关系中发现了反革命分子，就要放弃温情，一刀两断，大义灭亲。就是说对人民，“爱之欲其生”；对敌人“恶之欲其死”！
    我们应当头脑清醒、态度严肃，正确地认识镇压反革命问题，并求得我们党的巩固与发展。同志们，坚定起来！积极起来！行动起来！
