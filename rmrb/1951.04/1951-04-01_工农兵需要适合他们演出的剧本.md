　　Scripts Needed for Performances Suitable for Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
    To the Editor:
    Drama is an art form loved by the broad masses. Amateur theater troupes are constantly being established in various places. According to preliminary statistics from 85 counties in Shanxi Province, there are 1,960 relatively well-established amateur theater troupes, with 69,957 participants. In Wu'xiang County alone, there are more than 100 amateur rural theater troupes, averaging one troupe per administrative village. This is a very large propaganda force. How to make good use of this literary and artistic force for propaganda is a question worth noting.
    The biggest difficulty currently faced by the theater troupes is the serious lack of scripts that are closely linked to the current movement and suitable for their performances. During the Spring Festival this year, according to a survey of 20 rural theater troupes in Wu'xiang, the vast majority were learning to sing old operas from masters. Among the performed plays, only a few were about production mutual aid, and only one was about resisting America and aiding Korea. A rural theater troupe leader said: "It's not that we don't want to learn new plays, it's mainly because there's a lack of scripts. Even if we manage to find a few, they are either 'On the Yalu River,' 'The Fisherman's Hate,' or 'The End of the American Army.' These scripts are not about us farmers, the masses don't understand them, and the troupe members can't perform them."
    From what I understand, it's not just rural theater troupes that lack scripts; factories, military units, and professional cultural troupes also feel the same script shortage. I hope that playwrights will create, in a timely manner and in large quantities, scripts suitable for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Local newspapers should also publish more script creations. Local cultural authorities should strengthen guidance and assistance to amateur theater troupes, so that this literary and artistic army can play its propaganda role in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.

    Editor's Note: The above suggestion is correct. It is hoped that the National Drama Workers Association and playwrights will pay attention and take helping to solve the script shortage problem for rural and factory amateur theater troupes and professional cultural troupes in various places as one of the most urgent tasks at present.

### 工农兵需要适合他们演出的剧本

　　工农兵需要适合他们演出的剧本编辑同志：
    戏剧是广大群众所喜爱的一种艺术形式，各地业余剧团都不断地在建立着，如据山西省八十五个县的初步统计，比较巩固的业余剧团就有一九六○个，参加人数六九、九五七人。仅武乡一县就有业余农村剧团一百多个，平均每一个行政村就有一个剧团，这是一支很大的宣传队伍。如何很好地运用这支文艺队伍来进行宣传，这是一个值得注意的问题。
    目前剧团最大的困难是非常缺乏与当前运动密切结合而又适合他们演出的剧本。今年春节，根据武乡二十个农村剧团的调查，绝大部分是请师傅学唱旧戏；演出的剧中，关于生产互助的剧只有寥寥几个，抗美援朝的剧只有一个。一位农村剧团团长说：“俺们不是不愿学新戏，主要是剧本缺，即是勉强找到几个，不是《鸭绿江上》，就是《渔夫恨》，或者是《美军的下场》，这些剧本都不是讲俺农民的事儿，群众看不懂，团员也演不了。”
    据我了解，不只是农村剧团缺乏剧本，工厂、部队和职业文工团也同样感到剧本荒。我希望剧作家们及时地、大量地创作出适合广大工农兵需要的剧本；各地报纸也应该多选登剧本创作；各地文化机关应对业余剧团加强指导和帮助，使这支文艺军在抗美援朝运动中发挥它的宣传作用。
                                  山西人民广播电台  梁栋云
    编者按：上面这个意见是正确的，希望全国戏剧工作者协会和剧作家注意，把帮助解决各地农村、工厂业余剧团和专业文工团的剧本荒问题，作为当前最迫切的任务之一。
