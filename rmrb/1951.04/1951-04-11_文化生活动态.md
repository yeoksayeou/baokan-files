　　*“Current Events Handbook” Publishes Special Issue on Popularizing the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement*

    The 12th issue of "Current Events Handbook" has been published. This issue is a special issue on popularizing the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, mainly edited according to the third suggestion in the March 14th notice of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea. The "Editor's Note" of this issue writes: "It is hoped that all localities will make full use of the materials in this issue and step up publicity and organizational work in deepening and popularizing the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement."

    This issue contains the following articles:

    Wu Lengxi's "How to Commemorate this Year's 'May Day'?" The article writes: The most meaningful action for our people to commemorate this year's "May Day" is to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, oppose the arming of Japan, and defend world peace. The article further proposes three methods of commemoration: First, all factories and mines across the country should launch patriotic production competitions and improve trade union work. Second, the vast rural areas across the country should launch the spring plowing movement and strive for a good harvest this year. Third, people from all walks of life across the country should unite to assist the People's Government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and consolidate the great unity of the people.

    Mu Zhi's "Why Resist America and Aid Korea?" is for propagandists to use in speaking in this movement. The article particularly emphasizes the meaning of resisting America and aiding Korea is to protect our homes and defend our country, and criticizes the erroneous ideas of some people, namely why not fight Taiwan first but aid Korea first.

    This issue publishes Fang Shi's "How to Formulate Patriotic Pledges?" Liao Gailong's "How to Hold Good Accusation Meetings?" Zhu Bo's "How to Hold Good Representative Conferences on Resisting America and Aiding Korea?" Feng Luren's "How to Organize Small Propaganda Teams?" These four articles introduce various experiences in publicity and organizational work for local reference and emulation.

    Regarding the issue of propaganda networks, this issue publishes two articles, namely Liao Gailong's "The Provincial Committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Each Province Should Issue Propaganda Guidelines on a Monthly Basis" and Wang Zongyi's "Establishing and Developing Propaganda Networks in Mass Movements." The former article explains why propaganda guidelines should be issued on a monthly basis and what content the propaganda guidelines should include, based on the third provision of the "Decision on Establishing Propaganda Networks for the Masses of People Throughout the Party" issued by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on January 1st.

    This issue also publishes four articles explaining current events and policies, namely Chen Changqian's "Resolutely Suppress Counter-Revolutionary Activities," Zhao Disheng's "Do a Good Job in Labor Competitions to Resist America and Aid Korea," Wu Yusen's "Strive for a Good Harvest Throughout the Country This Year," and Kang Ying's "Continue to Develop the Religious Reform Movement."

    This issue publishes three songs that can be sung in the "May Day" grand demonstration, hoping that local radio stations, singing groups, music teachers, and trade union clubs will teach them in time (at least one song) so that the masses can sing well in the "May Day" grand demonstration.

　　*North China Basketball and Volleyball Tournament Opens Today*

　《时事手册》普及抗美援朝运动专号出版
    《时事手册》第十二期已出版。这一期是普及抗美援朝运动专号，主要是根据中国人民抗美援朝总会三月十四日通告中第三项建议编辑的。本期“编者的话”中写道：“希望各地在深入和普及抗美援朝运动中，充分利用本期的材料，加紧进行宣传和组织工作。”
    这一期有下面几篇文章：
    吴冷西的《怎样纪念今年的“五一”节？》该文写道：我们人民纪念今年“五一”节的最有意义的行动，就是加强抗美援朝，反对武装日本，以保卫世界和平。该文进而提出三点纪念的方法：第一，全国各工厂、矿山要展开爱国主义生产竞赛，改善工会工作。第二，全国广大农村要展开春耕运动，争取今年丰收。第三，全国各界人民要一致起来，协助人民政府镇压反革命分子，巩固人民大团结。
    穆之的《为什么要抗美援朝？》是供给宣传员在这一运动中讲话用的，该文特别强调地解释了抗美援朝就是保家卫国的意义，批判了部分群众中的错误思想，即为什么不先去打台湾而要先援助朝鲜。
    这一期登载了方实的《怎样订立爱国公约？》廖盖隆的《怎样开好控诉会？》朱波的《怎样开好抗美援朝代表会议？》冯鲁仁的《怎样组织小型宣传队？》这四篇文章介绍了宣传组织工作的各种经验，供给各地参考、效法。
    关于宣传网的问题，本期刊登了两篇文章，即廖盖隆的《各省中共省委应该按月制发宣传要点》，王宗一的《在群众运动中建立和发展宣传网》。前一篇文章是根据一月一日中共中央发布的《关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定》中第三项规定，解释了为什么要按月制发宣传要点和宣传要点应该包括那些内容。
    本期还登载了解释当前时事、政策的四篇文章，即陈昌谦的《坚决镇压反革命活动》，赵棣生的《搞好劳动竞赛来抗美援朝》，吴玉森的《争取今年全国丰收》，康英的《继续开展宗教革新运动。》
    本期刊登了“五一”节大示威中可以唱的三首歌曲，希望各地广播电台、歌咏团体、音乐教师和工会俱乐部及时教唱（至少教一首），以便群众在“五一”大示威中能够唱好。
