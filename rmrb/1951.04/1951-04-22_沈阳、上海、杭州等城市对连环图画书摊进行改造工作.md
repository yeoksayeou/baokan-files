Shenyang, Shanghai, Hangzhou and other major cities have initially completed the renovation of serial picture book stalls. Strengthening the editing and publication of new serial picture books has also attracted the attention of art workers and serial picture book workers in various places.

In Shenyang, the Publishing Department of the Northeast People's Government's Ministry of Culture and the Shenyang Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Culture and Education held a symposium for comic book vendors on March 30. The vendors clarified their understanding of the business: "Renting comic books is not only for making money, but also a mass propaganda and education work." The meeting determined that reactionary comic books should be prohibited from being rented out, and backward comic books should be gradually replaced by new comic books with progressive content. The following sixteen types of obviously reactionary comic books, which are named after science but are actually anti-science and promote reactionary war, should be immediately stopped from being rented out: Scientific Atomic Library, Scientific Atomic Secret, Scientific Airship, Scientific Atomic ABC Secret, Great Destruction of the Invading Flying City, Electric Country Little Hero, Scientific Flying Car, Scientific Flying Dragon Ship, Scientific Eight-Door Cannon, Foreign Adventure, Moon Adventure, Scientific Flying Cannon, Scientific Female Hero, Great Bomb Death Ray Machine, Bomb, Great Bomb Atomic Machine. The vendors all expressed their support for the handling of comic books decided by everyone. Liu Liang, a comic book vendor in Tiexi District, said in his speech: "In the past, I only aimed at making money, and did not know what impact renting comic books would have. I will also pay attention to serving the people in the future." At the meeting, the representative of Xinhua Bookstore Northeast Branch also reported on the methods of the store and Sanlian Bookstore to give preferential treatment and convenience to comic book rental operators to purchase new comic books.

In Shanghai, according to statistics, there are more than 2,500 comic book rental vendors, with approximately 200,000 readers every day. Most of the reading materials rented out by general book stalls are old comic books, and the content is all about magical romance, martial arts swordsmen, pornography, etc. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government's Press and Publication Department has begun to carry out the work of subsidizing and replacing new books through the Comic Book Stall Improvement Committee. The method is to exchange two old comic books for one new comic book. In the past two months, a total of 38 types of new comic books have been distributed, totaling 80,000 copies; a total of 160,000 old comic books have been recovered, totaling 10,000 types. After the general comic book rental workers exchanged for new books, they excitedly expressed: In the past, we opened our eyes and poisoned people's minds. Now the People's Government is helping us improve our business. We must seriously examine ourselves and gradually achieve the goal of renting out picture books that are beneficial to the people.

In Hangzhou, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government's Press and Publication Department carried out the work of replacing old comic book stalls in Hangzhou City with new ones. Since February 14th, it has united with Xinhua Bookstore, Hangzhou Cultural and Educational Center and other units. After more than 50 days of efforts, all pre-liberation old comic books with toxic elements from all 283 comic book stalls in the city have been replaced. This work was initially completed on April 7. A total of more than 38,000 old books were collected, and nearly 20,000 new books were exchanged.

Of course, in this work, we must pay attention to preventing some comic book renters from only taking out tattered comic books to exchange, while still keeping comic books containing toxic elements to rent out.

Regarding strengthening the editing and drawing of new comic books, the Publishing Department of the Northeast People's Government's Ministry of Culture also held a comic book symposium on March 28, calling on art workers to actively participate in the creation of new comic books. The art workers who attended the meeting criticized the idea that some people in the past neglected that comic books are a very popular mass reading material, and therefore did not pay enough attention to them. It was unanimously agreed that in the future, comic books should be used to cooperate with the propaganda and education of political current affairs, and it was decided to prepare to establish a "Comic Book Creation Research Group." In Shanghai, comic book workers issued a call: "Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Culture, combined with the specific patriotic actions of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries...create new patriotic comic books, and consciously eliminate the publication and distribution of reactionary and yellow bad comic books."

The main publishing area of old comic books is Shanghai. According to a statistical estimate: there are approximately 28,000 types of old comic books, with an estimated print run of 1,000 copies per type, totaling 28 million copies. Currently, there are approximately 10,000 types circulating in the market, taking Shanghai as an example, with an estimated 100 copies per type, totaling approximately one million copies. This estimated figure indicates that the work of striving for the large-scale publication of new comic books and seizing the position of old comic books still needs to be strengthened with great effort.

On the other hand, there is also a very bad phenomenon in Shanghai, the main producing area of old comic books. According to the Liberation Daily, during this period when the People's Government and comic book rental workers are working together to improve, a few publishers are taking an irresponsible attitude, only considering personal gain, still reprinting harmful old books, and continuing to spread toxins, which has aroused indignation in the publishing industry and other circles. It is also a very necessary step to conduct strict education on these publishers who simply seek profit and poison the people's minds.

### 沈阳、上海、杭州等城市对连环图画书摊进行改造工作

　　沈阳、上海、杭州等城市对连环图画书摊进行改造工作
    关于连环图画书摊的改造工作，在沈阳、上海、杭州等较大城市已经初步完成；关于加强新连环图画的编辑出版，也已引起各地美术工作者和连环图画工作者的注意。
    在沈阳，东北人民政府文化部出版处及沈阳市人民政府文教局在三月三十日召开了小人书业者座谈会，到会的摊贩们明确了对业务的认识：“出租小人书不仅是为了作买卖，而且也是一种群众性的宣传教育工作。”会上确定了对内容反动的连环图画应该禁止出租，对内容落后的连环图画应该逐渐地以进步内容的新连环图画来代替；并宣布了下列十六种以科学为名实质是反科学和宣扬反动战争的显然反动的连环图画，应即停止出租：科学原子库、科学的原子秘密、科学飞行船、科学原子ＡＢＣ的秘密、大破侵略的飞城、电国小侠、科学飞行车、科学飞龙船、科学八门炮、国外历险、月球探险记、科学飞行炮、科学女侠、大炸死光机、炸弹、大炸原子机。摊贩们都表示拥护大家决定的处理连环图画的办法。铁西区小人书摊贩刘良在发言中说：“过去我只以赚钱为目的，而不知道出租小人书会有什么影响，以后也要注意为人民服务了。”在会上，新华书店东北总分店代表并报告了该店与三联书店优待及便利连环图画出租业者购买新连环图画的方法。
    在上海，据统计，连环图画出租摊贩共有二千五百多家，每天拥有读者约二十万人；一般书摊出租的读品，绝大部分是旧连环图画，内容都是神奇演义、武侠剑客、色情诲淫等等。上海市人民政府新闻出版处已开始通过连环图画书摊改进委员会，进行贴补更换新书工作。办法是两本旧连环图画更换新连环图画一本。两月来，共发放新连环图画三十八种，计八万册；共收回旧连环图画十六万本，计一万种。一般连环图画出租工作者换得新书后，非常兴奋地表示：过去我们开着眼睛毒害人民思想，现在人民政府帮助我们改进业务，我们一定要好好地检讨自己，逐步做到完全出租有益于人民的画书。
    在杭州，浙江省人民政府新闻出版处进行改造杭州市连环图画书摊的以新调旧工作，自二月十四日开始，联合新华书店、杭州文教馆等单位，经五十余天的努力，使全市二百八十三家连环图画书摊所有解放前有毒素的旧连环图画全部调换。这一工作于四月七日初步结束。计收进旧书三万八千余册，换出新书近二万册。
    当然，在这个工作中必须注意，防止一部分连环画出租者只将破烂不堪的连环画拿出来掉换，而把含有毒素的连环画依旧保留起来出租。
    关于加强新连环图画的编绘工作，东北人民政府文化部出版处也于三月二十八日召开连环图画座谈会，号召美术工作者积极参加新连环图画的创作。与会的美术工作者在发言中批判了过去有些人由于忽视连环图画是一种群众性很大的通俗读物，因而对它不够重视的思想。一致认为今后应以连环图画来配合政治时事的宣传教育，并决定准备成立“连环图画创作研究组”。上海方面，连环图画工作者发出号召：“在上海市人民政府文化局领导下，结合抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命等具体的爱国行动………创作爱国主义的新连环画，自觉地肃清反动的黄色的坏连环画的出版和发行。”
    旧连环图画的出版地区主要是上海。据一项资料估计：旧连环图画约有二万八千种，每种以印行一千册计，计二千八百万册；现在流行在市面的，以上海为例，约一万种，每种以一百册计，全部约有一百万册。这一估计数字表示：争取新连环图画的大量出版、夺取旧连环图画的阵地的工作，还需要用很大的力量去加强。
    另一方面，在旧连环图画主要产区的上海还有一种很不好的现象。据解放日报反映：在此人民政府与连环画出租工作者协力改进时期，竟有少数出版商采取不负责任的态度，只为个人牟利打算，仍然翻印有害的旧书，继续散布毒素，已引起出版界等愤慨。对这些单纯牟利、毒害人民思想的出版商，进行严格的教育，也是很必要的一个步骤。（本文系根据四月四日东北日报、四月十日解放日报及四月十一日浙江日报、四月十四日上海文汇报及其他资料写成。）
