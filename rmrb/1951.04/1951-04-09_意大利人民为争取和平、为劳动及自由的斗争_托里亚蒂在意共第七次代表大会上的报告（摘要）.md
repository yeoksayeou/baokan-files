Xinhua News Agency, Rome, August 8th: TASS reports that Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti delivered a report on "The Italian People's Struggle for Peace, Labor, and Freedom" at the Seventh Congress of the Italian Communist Party on the 3rd.

In his report, Togliatti first emphasized that since the opening of the Milan Congress in January 1948, the Italian Communist Party has not only increased in membership, but also its political strength and prestige have grown. In the current historical stage, Italy's present and future depend on the leadership of the Communist Party and the forces it leads. Therefore, the responsibility of the Communist Party is to understand and protect the interests of the entire Italian nation, while uniting with all progressive forces active in countries around the world.

Togliatti then discussed the changes in the international situation since the last Party Congress. He pointed out that the characteristic of these changes is that they are more favorable to the people, the working class, and the cause of democratic peace. Togliatti particularly mentioned that the victory of the Chinese people is a manifestation of this change. This fact has severely hit the imperialist camp. Togliatti then exposed the predatory policy of the US monopoly capitalist ruling group. America's war preparations make the threat of war more realistic. The issue of defending peace has now become an overriding issue, and all other issues depend on this one.

Togliatti turned to domestic politics. He said that the Italian Communist Party opposes the current government of the Italian bourgeoisie as the largest party, but never opposes a government that can resolutely change the current policy of preparing for a new war and prevent Italy from falling into a new world disaster. The Communist Party declares that it not only demands that the government change its policy of opposing the most advanced people in the country, but also demands that it implement a new policy in many aspects that is not only for the working class but also for all other strata and all citizens.

After analyzing the disasters caused to Italy by the "aid" of the "Marshall Plan," Togliatti said: On the other hand, today, the "Marshall Plan" has largely ceased to exist. It has been replaced by American intervention. The purpose of this intervention is to re-militarize Italy and transform its peaceful economy into a war economy. In this case, Italy is subordinate to the will of American industrial groups, allowing them to manipulate Italy's destiny.

All of this shows that the ruling groups in Italy are primarily colluding with the American rulers and American imperialist monopolists. In order to implement its policies, which in all respects contradict the national interest, the Italian government does not hesitate to take all means to divide and intimidate the masses, from assassinating the General Secretary of the Communist Party to splitting trade unions, provoking, and adopting brutal suppression. From 1948 to 1949 and the first three months of 1950, a total of sixty-two workers were beaten to death by the police and the henchmen hired by the landlords, forty-eight of whom were Communist Party members. In conflicts with the police, 3,126 workers were injured, of whom 2,367 were Communist Party members. 92,169 workers were arrested and interrogated, of whom 73,780 were Communist Party members. 19,306 workers were sentenced to imprisonment, of whom 15,429 were Communist Party members. The total number of years of imprisonment sentenced was 8,441 years, of which Communist Party members accounted for 7,598 years.

This overall account is reminiscent of the darkest years of fascist tyranny, except that the fascists mostly persecuted leaders, while today the police of the "democratic" and "Christian" government of Gasperi use terror against the general working masses because they dare to express their opinions, demand work and freedom, and stand up to defend peace. This attack, which violates all provisions of the constitution and destroys civil liberties, against workers, is doomed to failure! Because it is resisted by all workers and all honest people in Italy!

Since 1947, the Communist Party has emerged as the inspirer and leader of the broad mass movement to defend peace, freedom and democracy, opposing the government's reactionary policies and its trampling of constitutional rights and freedoms. In the course of the struggle, a broad front has been established, composed of workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, middle bourgeoisie, intellectuals, and all citizens who realize that profound reforms must be carried out in Italy's social and economic structure.

Togliatti continued: Although this movement is large in scale, it has not been able to change our country's political leadership. Therefore, the Communist Party proposes to implement a policy of peace so that Italy will no longer be a tool in the hands of imperialist war-mongers. This policy of safeguarding our own security is achievable. This policy requires Italy to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty, from this military-political organization that prepares to invade the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and requires Italy to act in solidarity with those who refuse to aggress against Korea and China.

In order to achieve the goal of establishing a front that implements a policy of national independence, the Communist Party must unite all forces, movements, and groups willing to destroy the political monopoly of the Christian Democratic Party and act together. The Communist Party will adhere to this policy in the upcoming municipal elections, adopting the correct suggestions of the Socialist Party.

However, elections are only an episode in the struggle. The main focus should be on organizing broad mass movements. Among these movements, the movement for peace takes the primary position. The important initiative of holding a national referendum on the peace treaty has received the most active help and support from the Communist Party.

Togliatti said: Communists must expand their activities day by day, they should attract all strata of the working class to their own track, and first of all consolidate their unity. This activity should be universally unfolded among all social strata in our country who are concerned with defending democracy. It is necessary to demand that monopolistic enterprises be nationalized and that land reform be implemented. The allies of the working class are the peasants and the middle class, who have been threatened with destruction by the war preparation policy.

Finally, Togliatti spoke in detail about the tasks in practical work and the tasks in organizational work. Togliatti concluded his report with the following words: "Today, what Italy needs most is peace; therefore, the Communist Party must do everything possible to save the peace of the Italian people. The Communist Party is doing everything to achieve this goal. It is convinced that by doing so, the Communist Party will become the greatest force in the country, a force that holds the leadership."

　　意大利人民为争取和平、为劳动及自由的斗争
　  托里亚蒂在意共第七次代表大会上的报告（摘要）
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党总书记托里亚蒂于三日在意大利共产党第七次代表大会上作了关于《意大利人民为争取和平、为劳动及自由的斗争》的报告。
    托里亚蒂在报告中首先着重指出：自从一九四八年一月米兰代表大会开幕以来，意大利共产党不但是党员人数增加了，而且它的政治力量和威信也增长了。在目前的历史阶段中，意大利的现在和将来是依靠共产党的领导和共产党所领导的力量的。因此，共产党的责任就是了解和保护整个意大利民族的利益，同时和在全世界各国活动的一切进步力量团结一致。
    托里亚蒂接着谈到自从上次党代表大会以来国际形势的变化。他指出这种变化的特点就是更加有利于人民、工人阶级和民主和平事业的变化。托里亚蒂特别提出：中国人民的胜利就是这个变化的表现。这件事实严重地打击了帝国主义阵营。托里亚蒂随即揭露了美国垄断资本统治集团的掠夺方针。美国的备战措施使战争的威胁变得更加现实。保卫和平的问题现在已经变成压倒一切的问题，其他一切问题都取决于这个问题。
    托里亚蒂转而谈到国内的政治。他说：意大利共产党反对意大利资产阶级现政府的最大的政党，而决不反对能坚决改变准备新战争的现行政策和不让意大利陷入新的世界灾难之中的政府。共产党声明：它不仅要求政府改变它反对国内最先进的人民的政策，而且要求它在多方面实施不只是为工人阶级同时也为其余一切阶层、一切公民的新政策。
    托里亚蒂在分析了“马歇尔计划”的“援助”对意大利造成的灾害之后说：从另一方面来说，今天，“马歇尔计划”已大体不存在了。它已被美国的干涉代替了。这种干涉的目的在于使意大利重新军国主义化，并把它的和平经济转变为战争经济。在这种情况下，意大利就从属于美国工业家集团的意志，任它摆布着意大利的命运。
    所有这一切都表明：意大利的统治集团首先是跟美国统治者及美国的帝国主义垄断资本家勾搭起来的。意大利政府为了执行它那种在各方面都与民族利益相违背的政策，竟不惜采取一切分化与恫吓人民大众的手段，从谋刺共产党总书记起，到分裂工会、挑衅和采取野蛮的镇压。从一九四八年到一九四九年和一九五○年最初三个月，前后有六十二个劳动者被警察被地主所雇佣的走狗打死，其中四十八人是共产党员。在和警察的冲突中，有三千一百二十六个劳动者受伤，其中有二千三百六十七人是共产党员。被逮捕和被审讯的有九万二千一百六十九个劳动者，其中有七万三千七百八十人是共产党员。被判处徒刑的有一万九千三百零六个劳动者，其中一万五千四百二十九人是共产党员。判决徒刑的年数一共是八千四百四十一年，其中共产党员占七千五百九十八年。
    这笔总账令人想起法西斯暴政最黑暗的年代，所不同的是：法西斯分子所迫害的大都是领导人物，而今天加斯贝利“民主的”“基督教”政府的警察却把恐怖手段也用来对付广大的一般劳动大众。这种破坏宪法的一切规定和破坏公民自由而对劳动者（因为他们敢于表示自己的意见，要求工作与自由，并挺身保卫和平）发动的进攻，是注定要失败的。因为它受到意大利所有的劳动者、所有正直的人们的抵抗！
    从一九四七年起，共产党就以保卫和平、自由与民主的广大群众运动的鼓舞者与领导者的姿态出现，反对着政府的反动政策，反对着政府蹂躏宪法权利与自由的行为。在斗争过程中，由工人、农民、小资产阶级、中等资产阶级、知识分子、一切觉悟到必须对意大利的社会与经济结构进行深刻改革的公民所组成的广泛阵线，已经建立起来了。
    托里亚蒂继称：这个运动虽然规模壮阔，但是还不能改变我国的政治领导。因此，共产党提议实施和平政策，以便意大利不再充当帝国主义战争贩子手中的工具。这个保卫我们自己安全的政策是可能实现的。这个政策要求意大利脱离北大西洋公约，脱离这个准备侵略苏联与人民民主国家的军事——政治组织，要求意大利与那些拒绝侵略朝鲜与中国的人民一致行动。
    为了达到建立实现民族独立政策的阵线的目的，共产党必须联合一切愿意摧毁基督教民主党政治垄断的力量、运动和集团，大家共同行动。共产党将在行将到来的市选中坚持这个方针，采纳社会党的正确建议。
    不过，选举只是斗争的一个插曲而已。主要的注意力应当放在组织广泛的人民群众运动方面。在这些运动之中占首要地位的是拥护和平的运动。和平拥护者就和平公约举行全民投票的重要倡议，得到共产党最积极的帮助与支持。
    托里亚蒂说：共产党人必须一天比一天扩大自己的活动范围，应该把工人阶级的一切阶层都吸引到自己的轨道上，并首先巩固他们的团结。这种活动应该在我国的关心保卫民主的一切社会阶层中间普遍展开。必须要求把垄断性的企业收归国有，并实行土地改革。工人阶级的同盟者便是农民与中产阶级——备战政策已使他们遭到毁灭的威胁。
    最后，托里亚蒂详细谈到实际工作中的任务和组织工作中的任务。托里亚蒂用下面的话结束了他的报告：“今天意大利首先需要的是和平；因此，共产党一定要竭力挽救意大利人民的和平。共产党竭尽一切来达成这个目的。它深信：这样做，共产党就会成为国家的最伟大的力量，成为掌握领导权的力量。”
