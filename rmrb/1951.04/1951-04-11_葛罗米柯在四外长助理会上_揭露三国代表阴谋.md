　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 7th: The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers continued their meeting on the 6th, chaired by U.S. Representative Jessup.
    The representatives of the three Western powers expressed their opinions on the wording of the first item on the agenda proposed by the Soviet delegation on the 4th. French Representative Parodi defended the clearly unsatisfactory proposal made by the three countries on the 2nd, and attempted to diminish the significance of the elimination of German militarism and the reduction of the four countries' armed forces, while prioritizing the issue of armament levels. He insisted without reason that the Foreign Ministers' meeting should discuss the disarmament of all countries, not just the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. British Representative Davies echoed Parodi's remarks. U.S. Representative Jessup made a distorted "historical exploration" in an attempt to prove that the discussion of the four countries' disarmament issue must begin with consideration of armament levels.
    Soviet Representative Gromyko pointed out in his speech that the representatives of the three countries had not mentioned the issues of the North Atlantic Treaty and U.S. military bases, as well as the implementation of the Trieste part of the Italian Peace Treaty, which are of great importance for improving the European situation.
    Gromyko then responded to the objections of the three countries' representatives to the new Soviet proposal. He pointed out that the reason why the Soviet delegation suggested first discussing the elimination of German militarism and giving priority to the four countries' disarmament in the proposed discussion of the four countries' disarmament and armament levels was to ensure that the wording of the Foreign Ministers' meeting agenda would enable the Foreign Ministers to adopt the decisions necessary to consolidate peace, improve relations between the four countries, and stop the arms expansion movement. The Soviet delegation believes that the proposal for universal disarmament put forward by the three countries has no practical basis, because the Four Foreign Ministers cannot make decisions for all countries. The attitude of the three countries in insisting on opposing the study of the practical and feasible task of reducing the armed forces and armaments of the four countries makes it impossible for the Soviet delegation not to seriously doubt whether the three countries really want to study this issue from the point of view of reducing armed forces, or whether they hope to confine themselves to making some empty talk about disarmament and actually continue to expand armaments and prepare for another war.
    Gromyko denounced the representatives of the three countries for verbally supporting the elimination of the causes of international tension in Europe, but actually refusing to study proposals that genuinely aim at eliminating these causes under various pretexts. Gromyko reviewed the painful experiences from the League of Nations to the United Nations on the issue of discussing the reduction of armaments, proving that those countries that once hindered the solution of this problem are still adhering to their past course. The Soviet delegation believes that it is extremely important for the agenda to clearly state that the issue is to study the reduction of the armaments and armed forces of the four countries. It opposes burying the important task of reducing armaments and armed forces in various ambiguous words.

### 葛罗米柯在四外长助理会上　揭露三国代表阴谋

　　葛罗米柯在四外长助理会上
  　揭露三国代表阴谋
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎七日讯：四国外长助理于六日继续举行会议，由美国代表耶塞普任主席。
    西方三国代表对苏联代表团四日提出的议程第一项的措辞发表意见。法国代表巴罗第为三国于二日提出的显然不能令人满意的建议辩护，并企图缩小肃清德国军国主义与裁减四国军队问题的意义，而把军备水平问题提到第一位。他毫无理由地坚持外长会议应讨论一切国家而不是苏、美、英、法四国的裁军问题。英国代表戴维斯附和巴罗第的发言。美国代表耶塞普则歪曲事实地作了一番“历史的探讨”，企图证明讨论四国裁军问题必须先从考虑军备水平问题开始。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯在发言中首先指出：三国代表毫未提及对于改进欧洲局势具有极大重要性的关于北大西洋公约和美国军事基地问题以及履行对意和约中关于的里雅斯特部分的问题。
    葛罗米柯接着答复三国代表对苏联新建议的反对意见。他指出：苏联代表团之所以建议首先讨论肃清德国军国主义并在建议的关于四国裁军和军备水平的讨论中把优先权给予四国裁军这个主要的问题，是由于考虑到外长会议议程的措辞，应该使外长们能够通过为巩固和平、改善四国之间的关系、停止扩张军备运动所必需的决定。苏联代表团认为三国所提出的普遍裁军的建议是没有实际基础的，因为四国外长不能替所有国家通过决定。三国坚持反对研究苏联所提出的裁减四国军队和军备的实际可行的任务，这种态度使苏联代表团不能不严重怀疑三国是否真想从裁减军队的观点来研究这个问题，还是希望只限于发表一些裁军的空论而实际上则继续进行扩张军备和准备另一次战争。
    葛罗米柯斥责三国代表口头上赞成消除造成欧洲国际紧张局势的原因，但是实际上却以种种借口拒绝研究真正以消除这些原因为目的的建议。葛罗米柯就讨论裁减军备问题回溯了从国际联盟到联合国的惨痛经验，证明曾经阻挠这个问题的解决的那些国家，现在仍然坚持它们以往的路线。苏联代表团认为：议程明确说明问题在于研究裁减四国军备与军队，是极为重要的。它反对把裁减军备和军队的重要任务埋葬在各种暧昧的措辞中。
