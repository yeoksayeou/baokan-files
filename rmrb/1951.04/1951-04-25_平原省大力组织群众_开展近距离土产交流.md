　　Pingyuan Province Vigorously Organizes the Masses
　  to Develop Short-Distance Local Product Exchange
    Organizing mass-based short-distance local product exchanges within the province through simple, convenient methods familiar to the local people is the main characteristic of Pingyuan Province's local product exchange work. According to statistics from before the Spring Festival this year, over 80 percent of the total sales volume of ninety major local products (excluding grain, cotton, and oil crops) were exchanged within the province through short-distance trade.

    In addition to holding general local product conferences, the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government has widely promoted a mass-based trade contract system, organizing the exchange of major local products within the province, regions, and counties. According to statistics from eighteen counties, from last winter to now, government at the county, district, and village levels, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels, and mass organizations or local cadres representing the masses have signed over 10,000 local product exchange contracts. Last December, Lin County alone signed 652 contracts, exchanging 2.95 million jin of local products within the county, 5,080 pieces of farm tools and implements, 690,000 jin of oil cakes, and contracting the transport of 2.4 million jin of grain.

    Department store fairs, temple fairs, livestock fairs, and market days in various parts of Pingyuan Province have been widely restored or developed under the guidance of people's governments at all levels. This has played a significant role in short-distance local product exchanges. Almost every county in Pingyuan Province has three to ten department store fairs, livestock fairs, or temple fairs each month. Generally, towns and cities have a market day every other day. In order to organize local product exchanges in a planned way, the people's governments are also focusing on organizing larger temple fairs and department store fairs. Before the fairs, they assist state-owned trading companies, private merchants, and handicraftsmen in specifically planning the varieties and quantities of goods to be sold and purchased, arranging market management, security, and hygiene work during the fair, and issuing advertisements for publicity. Cities and towns such as Anyang City have also organized industrial and agricultural product exhibitions to expand local product exchanges. Some local gatherings even have blackboards that report the transaction status of local products on the spot, encouraging legitimate transactions and opposing speculation and profiteering. A large quantity of local and special products are traded at these gatherings. According to statistics, during these gatherings, the daily turnover of Beijing-Guangzhou general merchandise often exceeds two or three times the usual amount.

    In some areas of Pingyuan Province, transportation is inconvenient, and farmers cannot afford to transport and sell large quantities of local products at one time. Therefore, they have also utilized agricultural production mutual aid teams or organized temporary local product sales mutual aid teams to promote local product sales, with good results. For example, when farmers in seventeen villages in Shen County sold water chestnuts and fresh lotus roots, under the specific guidance of the district and village people's governments, they pooled funds, organized 46 large carts and 22 small carts, and then jointly organized 15 private merchant carts. In January alone, they transported and sold more than 300,000 jin of water chestnuts and more than 400,000 jin of lotus roots, equivalent to 64 percent of the total output of water chestnuts and lotus roots in these seventeen villages. In addition, some places in Pingyuan Province also advocate mutual exchange between farmers in mountainous and plains areas. For example, farmers in mountainous areas of Anyang, Xinxiang, and other counties carry hoe handles, pitchforks, sickle handles, timber, etc., on their backs or with donkeys to the mountain pass, and exchange them for cabbage, greens, etc., brought by farmers from the plains on pre-arranged dates. This method is simple and easy to implement and has also played a considerable role in short-distance local product exchanges.

### 平原省大力组织群众  开展近距离土产交流

　　平原省大力组织群众
　  开展近距离土产交流
    通过简单方便又为当地人民所习惯的方式，在本省范围内组织群众性的近距离土产交流，是平原省土产交流中的主要特点。据今年春节以前的统计，全省九十种大宗土产（不包括粮、棉、油料）在省内近距离交流的数量已占全部销出量的百分之八十以上。
    平原省人民政府除普遍召开土产会议外，曾广泛推行群众性的贸易合同制，组织大宗土产在本省、本区、本县内交流。据十八个县的统计，从去年冬季到现在，县、区、村各级政府、各级供销合作社和群众团体或地方干部代表群众互相订立的土产交流合同就有一万多件。去年十二月，林县一个县就订立合同六百五十二件，在县内交流土产二百九十五万斤，农具、用具五千零八十件，油饼六十九万斤，包运粮食二百四十万斤。
    平原省各地的百货大会、庙会、骡马大会和市集在各级人民政府倡导下，已普遍恢复或发展起来。这对于近距离的土产交流起了很大的作用。平原省各县差不多每月都有三次到十次的百货大会、骡马大会或庙会。一般城、镇多是隔天一集。为了有计划地组织土产交流，人民政府更有重点地组织较大的庙会和百货大会。会前协助国营贸易公司、私商和手工业者具体计划推销和收购货物的品种、数量，布置会期内的市场管理及治安、卫生工作，同时并发出广告，进行宣传。安阳市等城、镇并组织工、农业品展览会，以扩大土产交流。有些地方的集会，更有随时报道会场上土产成交情况的黑板报，鼓励正当交易，反对投机取巧。土、特产品在这种集会上成交的数量很大。据统计，在这类集会期间，京、广杂货业的每日营业额常超过平时两、三倍。
    平原省有些地区交通不便，农民无力一次运销大宗土产，因此他们又利用农业生产互助组或组织临时性的土产推销互助组推销土产，成绩很好。例如莘县十七个村的农民推销荸荠和鲜藕时，在区、村人民政府具体指导下，集中资金，组织大车四十六辆、小车二十二辆，再联合私商大车十五辆，在一月份一个月内就运销荸荠三十多万斤，藕四十多万斤，等于这十七个村的荸荠和藕总产量的百分之六十四。此外，平原省有些地方还提倡山地和平原间的农民互通有无。如安阳、新乡等县山地的农民把山地出产的钁把、杈子、镰把、木材等，用人挑、驴驮送到山口，在预先约定的日子，与平地农民送来的白菜、青菜等交换。这种办法简便易行，在近距离土产交流中也起了相当大的作用。
