    (14) The spy was finally caught by Granny Yao. At the time, he still tried to quibble, saying that the police station had agreed to let him go. But no matter what he said, Granny Yao held onto him and took him to the police station.
    (15) Granny Yao and Hei Zhaoming's heroic actions were admired by the neighbors. Everyone said, "We should learn from Granny Yao!" All the students of Hebei Institute of Technology specially made two silk banners and presented them to Granny Yao and Hei Zhaoming. (The End)
