    To the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Committee of the Four Inner Districts of Beijing:
    Should Not Refuse to Collect Comfort Money on Behalf of Others

    To the Editor:
    The masses voluntarily donating comfort money is a concrete action of the masses loving the People's Volunteer Army. Why do some institutions refuse to accept it?

    Recently, I saved 216,000 yuan from my living expenses, wanting to donate this money as comfort money. But when I took the money to the District Office of the Four Inner Districts of Beijing, they said to me, "Your intention is very good," "We are very grateful to you," and "You should take it back and use it yourself," refusing to accept the money. After my repeated requests, they issued a letter of introduction, asking me to send the money to the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Committee of the Four Inner Districts. However, the comrades of the committee also refused to accept the money. Their reason was: the first comfort campaign had already passed; the second had not yet been launched. Later, I said, "Isn't there a call for book donations now! Please use this money to buy books for me. I don't know what kind of books are needed at the front. It would be best if you could buy them on my behalf." In this way, they introduced me to the General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association at Heguosi West Crossing, and I handed over the money there.

    I believe that the District Office and the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Committee of the Four Inner Districts should not refuse to accept donations from the people. This will dampen the enthusiasm of the people and will also result in the volunteer soldiers at the front receiving less comfort materials from the motherland.

    Editor's Note: The practice of the District Office and the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Committee of the Four Inner Districts of Beijing refusing to accept comfort money from the masses shows a lack of political enthusiasm and irresponsibility. This is wrong. At any time, funds voluntarily donated by the masses should be responsibly collected and transferred to the sub-branch of the People's Bank.

### 北京市内四区抗美援朝委员会  不应拒绝代收慰劳金

    北京市内四区抗美援朝委员会
    不应拒绝代收慰劳金编辑同志：
    群众自愿捐献慰劳金，是群众热爱人民志愿军的具体行为。为什么有些机关竟拒绝接受呢？
    最近，我从生活费内节省下二十一万六千元，想把这笔钱作为慰劳金捐献。但当我拿着钱到北京市内四区区公所时，他们却向我说：“你的意思很好”、“我们很感谢你”和“还是拿回去自己用吧”等话，拒绝收款。经过我再三要求，他们才开了一张介绍信，要我把款送到内四区抗美援朝委员会。可是，该会的同志也拒绝收款。他们的理由是：第一次慰劳运动已过；第二次尚未发动。后来我说：“现在不是正号召捐书吗！请你们把这些钱代我买书吧。我不知道前方需要何种书，由你们代买最好。”这样，他才介绍我到护国寺西口中苏友好协会总支会，把这笔款子交下了。
    我认为内四区区公所及抗美援朝委员会不应该拒绝收受人民的捐款，这样会打击人民的热情，也会使前方志愿军战士少得到来自祖国的慰问物资。

    编者按：北京市内四区区公所及抗美援朝委员会拒绝接受群众慰劳金的做法是缺乏政治热情和不负责任的表现。这是不对的。不论任何时候，对群众自愿捐献的款项，均应负责代收，并转交人民银行支行。
