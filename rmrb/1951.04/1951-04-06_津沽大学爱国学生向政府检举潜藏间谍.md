　　Tianjin’s Catholic Church school, private Tianjin University, has seen fifty students, including both Catholic and non-Catholic students, write letters to the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau in recent months, exposing French priests Bu Xiangxian, Bao Yihua, and Fang Ruhui, American imperialist spies hidden within the school. They demanded that the government arrest them and punish them according to the law.

　　As early as last December, five students from the Civil Engineering Department of the school, Zhang Junshi, Ai Changgeng, Xu Guangquan, Zheng Renlong, and Liu Jinghe, wrote an article to the Tianjin Daily entitled "Exposing the Darkness of Tianjin University, We Want to Accuse," revealing the reactionary and destructive facts of Bu Xiangxian and others. They demanded that the government severely punish these American imperialist spies and assist the school in thoroughly reforming the school administration.

　　In January of this year, the majority of teachers and students of the school expressed satisfaction with the school board's dismissal of Bu Xiangxian, which reformed the school administration. However, they were very dissatisfied that American spies like Bu Xiangxian, who had consistently engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, were still at large and continued to operate within the school. Therefore, they wrote letters to the Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, exposing the counter-revolutionary crimes of Bu Xiangxian and others, requesting the government to punish them. In a joint letter of accusation written by students Xu Weizhong and Wang Junhuai to Director Xu Jianguo, they detailed Bu Xiangxian's crimes, including distributing reactionary propaganda during the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, obstructing and threatening Catholic students from volunteering for military cadre schools, coercing students to join "anti-communist guerrillas," and collecting military intelligence. In many other letters of accusation, the crimes of Bu and others, such as inducing students to listen to "Voice of America," slandering the Soviet Union, undermining Sino-Soviet friendship, dividing student unity, and sabotaging the Catholic independent reform movement, were also cited. Students Zhang Zhaoming, Han Yunping, and six other students said in a joint letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau on January 12: "These facts are intolerable to us, the youth of New China. We demand that the government arrest and severely punish these American spies, inspect the place where they conduct counter-revolutionary activities -- 'Priest's Building' -- and thoroughly eliminate these counter-revolutionary elements to ensure the safety of our country."

　　The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau received a total of fourteen letters of accusation from students of the school. The students who wrote the letters included Li Wanru, Pei Bingyong, Wang Gengxin, Guan Xuecheng, Liang Defang, Yuan Lixian, Li Xiangtao, Xu Weizhong, Wang Junhuai, Wang Ruihua, Lin Xien, Ma Haoran, Fang Zhihou, Hu Ensheng, Wang Zongyuan, Liu Zhiying, Feng Youbao, Tian Shuguo, Zhou Yaoguang, Liu Xiyuan, Li Xingcun, Liu Shigang, Tian Wan, Lin Tianji, Chu Yonggui, Zhou Shoubai, Wang Quan, Wang Lianguo, Wang Shiying, Wang Youtian, Li Bingyi, Sun Guoliang, Liu Jinghe, Kong Rongzhang, Li Ziming, Zhang Jiarui, Chen Jizu, Xie Guangming, Nie Shulan, Zhu Ganhu, Zhang Zhaoming, Li Yingju, Zhang Jun, Han Yunping, Li Zhiguang, Lu Yongqi, Wang Xuezhe, Li Mingxian, Meng Zhaosui, and Kui Zhaoli, totaling fifty people.

　　津沽大学爱国学生向政府检举潜藏间谍
    【本报讯】天津市天主教教会学校私立津沽大学，包括公教生与非公教生的五十个学生，最近几个月来，纷纷写信向天津市人民政府公安局检举潜藏于该校内的美帝国主义间谍法国籍神甫卜相贤、鲍翊华、房如晦，要求政府把他们逮捕起来依法惩办。
    早在去年十二月，该校土木工程系学生张俊士、艾长庚、徐广泉、郑人龙、刘景和等五人，就以“揭穿津沽大学的黑暗，我们要控诉”为题，写文章给天津日报，揭露卜相贤等的反动破坏事实，要求政府严厉惩办这些美帝国主义的间谍分子，并协助该校彻底改革学校行政。
    今年一月，该校广大师生对该校董事会将卜相贤撤职，使该校行政得到改革，表示满意，但对一贯进行反革命活动的卜相贤等美国间谍仍然逍遥法外，继续在校内活动，甚为不满。因此纷纷写信给该市人民政府公安局检举卜相贤等反革命罪行，要求政府予以惩办。在学生徐维忠、王俊槐联名写给许建国局长的检举信中，详细列举了卜相贤等在抗美援朝运动中，散发反动宣传品，阻挠威胁天主教徒同学志愿报考军事干部学校，诱迫同学参加“反共游击队”，搜集军事情报等反革命罪行及间谍活动。在其他许多检举信中，也都举出卜犯等劝诱学生收听“美国之音”，诬蔑苏联，破坏中苏友好，分裂同学团结，破坏天主教自立革新运动等罪行。学生张肇铭、韩云屏等八个同学在一月十二日联名写给该市公安局的检举信中说：“这些事实，是我们新中国的青年所不能容忍的，我们要求政府逮捕并严惩这些美国间谍，检查他们进行反革命活动的地方——“神甫楼”，彻底清除这些反革命分子，以保障我国家之安全。”
    天津市人民政府公安局共收到该校学生的检举信十四封，写信的同学有李婉如、裴秉镛、汪更新、关学成、梁德芳、袁礼贤、李象涛、徐维忠、王俊槐、王瑞华、林锡恩、马浩然、方志厚、胡恩升、王宗源、刘之颖、冯佑葆、田树国、周耀光、刘锡沅、李杏村、刘士钢、田万、林天骥、褚永贵、周寿柏、王泉、王联国、王士瑛、王幼田、李秉彝、孙国梁、刘景和、孔荣璋、李子明、张家瑞、陈继祖、谢光铭、聂淑兰、朱干慧、张肇铭、李应驹、张浚、韩云屏、李志广、路永奇、王学哲、李铭贤、孟昭随、夔兆丽等五十人。
