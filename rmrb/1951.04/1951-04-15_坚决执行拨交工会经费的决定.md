A short commentary:

　　Resolutely Implement the Decision to Allocate Trade Union Funds
    The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council issued a decision on the 9th regarding the allocation of trade union funds by the administrative side or the capitalists of enterprises, institutions, and schools in accordance with the Trade Union Law. At the same time, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions also issued interim measures for the collection of trade union funds allocated by the administrative side or the capitalists of enterprises, institutions, and schools. This is an important decision regarding trade union work, and all localities should resolutely implement it.

    After the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, the situation of public and private enterprises allocating 2% of the total wage bill to trade union funds has been uneven. According to incomplete statistics, in state-owned enterprises, some places have achieved 100%, and the worst is still above 70%. In private enterprises, some are able to pay on time in accordance with the law, but most have arrears. Regionally speaking, the old liberated areas are better than the newly liberated areas, and large cities are better than small and medium-sized cities. By industry, industry is better than commerce, and large industrial and commercial enterprises are better than small and medium-sized ones. The main ideological reasons why these enterprises cannot allocate trade union funds in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Union Law are as follows: In the case of public enterprises, most are worried about increased costs. In the case of private enterprises, most are afraid of reduced profits. They all believe that allocating trade union funds is an extra burden, and they do not know that allocating funds to run trade unions is a necessary condition for relying on the working class, relying on the trade unions, and mobilizing workers to develop production. They still do not know that in industrial and mining enterprises where trade union organizations are not sound, production efficiency is bound to be low, quality is bound to be poor, and therefore costs cannot be reduced and profits cannot be increased. Of course, another reason why trade union funds have not been fully paid is that some trade unions have adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards the collection of trade union funds, and even have a dependence on finance, thinking that if there is no money, they can ask the government for it, and therefore have failed to actively urge the administration and the capitalists to allocate funds on time. Moreover, some relevant departments in the government have mostly not inquired about the collection of trade union funds, and therefore, the supervision of implementation has been lax.

    This situation must be changed. In addition to ideological education, there should be certain guarantees for changing the situation. The decision of the Financial and Economic Committee stipulates that "if the administrative side or the capitalists fail to pay or are in arrears with trade union funds, they shall be charged a late payment fee on a daily basis," and stipulates the time for supplementary payments of past unpaid trade union funds and the start of payments for new units. This not only provides a detailed explanation of the implementation of Article 24, Paragraph 2 of the Trade Union Law, but also provides a powerful condition for the development of trade union work in various places.

    The People's Republic of China is a country led by the working class, and all phenomena that do not attach importance to trade union work and do not abide by the Trade Union Law should not be allowed to continue to exist. Paying trade union funds on time in accordance with the law is a step that should be implemented immediately.

### 坚决执行拨交工会经费的决定

　　坚决执行拨交工会经费的决定
    政务院财政经济委员会九日发布了关于企业、机关、学校的行政方面或资方依照工会法拨交工会经费的决定，同时全国总工会也发布了关于企业、机关、学校的行政方面或资方拨交工会经费收缴暂行办法，这是有关于工会工作的重要决定，各地应坚决加以执行。
    工会法颁布后，公私企业按照工资总额百分之二拨交工会经费的情况，是不平衡的。据不完全统计，在国营企业中，有的地方做到了百分之百，最差的也在百分之七十以上。私营企业中，也有一部分能依法按期拨付，但大多数均有拖欠现象。以地区说，老解放区较新解放区好，大城市较中小城市好。以业别说，工业较商业好，大型工商业又较中小型好。这些企业不能按照工会法规定拨付工会经费的主要思想情况是这样的：在公营企业方面，大半是顾虑成本增加。在私营企业方面，大多是害怕利润减少。他们均以为拨交工会经费是额外负担，而不晓得拨经费办工会，正是依靠工人阶级，依靠工会、发动工人发展生产的必要的条件。他们还不知道，凡是工会组织不健全的工矿企业，生产效率必然不高，质量必然不好，因而成本不能降低，利润也无从增加。当然，工会经费未能全部如数照付的另一原因是某些工会对于工会经费的收缴采取了自流的态度，甚至存在着在财政上的依赖思想，认为没有钱就可向政府要，因而未能主动积极地督促行政和资方按时拨付。而政府中某些有关部门对于工会经费的收缴亦大多未加过问，因此，在督促执行上就显得松懈。
    这种情况，必须改变。改变办法，除在思想上，应进行教育外，还应有一定的保证办法。财政经济委员会的决定中规定“如行政方面或资方逾期未缴或欠缴工会经费时，应按日增缴滞纳金”，并且规定了对于过去未缴工会经费的补缴与新单位开始缴纳的时间，这不但对工会法第二十四条第二款的实施，作了一细则性的说明，而对于各地工会工作的开展，亦提供了一个有力的条件。
    中华人民共和国是工人阶级为领导的国家，一切不重视工会工作、不遵守工会法的现象不应当继续允许存在。依法按期拨付工会经费，就是应当立即加以实现的一个步骤。
