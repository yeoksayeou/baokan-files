　　Tokyo Overseas Chinese Residential Area Illegally Searched by Japanese Police

　　[Xinhua News Agency, 6th] According to the "Japan Correspondence," a publication for overseas Chinese in Japan: The reactionary Japanese authorities, under the pretext of searching for "narcotics," dispatched approximately 1,000 fully armed police officers on the evening of February 1st to illegally search Yuelaizhuang in Tokyo, where our compatriots reside. Yuelaizhuang houses over 50 overseas Chinese families, totaling more than 170 people. In addition to the Japanese police, American soldiers were present to supervise the search. During the search, a machine gun was set up for every two households. It was late at night and the weather was cold; some people were already asleep, but they were all awakened and ordered to raise their hands and stand at attention. Women and children were not allowed to put on clothes to keep warm for as long as four hours. During the search, the Japanese police arbitrarily insulted our compatriots, even threatening women and children with guns, and shamelessly insulting women.

　　This incident has aroused the indignation of overseas Chinese in Japan and Japanese democratic groups. The day after the incident, the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Federation and Yuelaizhuang sent representatives to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese authorities.

　　东京华侨居住地区竟遭日警非法搜查
    【新华社六日讯】据旅日华侨刊物“日本通讯”消息：日本反动当局曾以搜查“麻药”为借口，于二月一日晚间出动全副武装的警察约一千名，非法搜查我侨胞居住的东京悦来庄。悦来庄住有我侨胞五十多户，共一百七十余人。此次搜查除日警外并有美军在场监视。搜查时，每两户架设机关枪一挺。当时正值夜深天寒，有人早已就寝，但都被唤起，并命令高举两手，作立正姿势，妇女与孩子亦不许穿衣取暖，共达四小时之久。在搜查时，日警任意辱骂我侨胞，甚至对妇孺也出枪恫吓，并无耻地侮辱妇女。
    此一事件已引起在日侨胞与日本民主团体的愤慨。事件发生后的第二天，东京华侨联合会与悦来庄曾推派代表向日本当局提出严重抗议。
