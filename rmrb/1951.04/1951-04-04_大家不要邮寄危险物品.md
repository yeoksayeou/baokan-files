    Everyone, Please Do Not Mail Dangerous Items
    To the Editors:

    On February 13th, a postal bag was being transported from Beijing to Shouyang, Shanxi. Because someone mailed toy pistol caps in the mail, compression caused an explosion, setting the postal bag on fire. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and not much mail was burned. The post office's failure to thoroughly inquire about and accept such mail is a post office oversight. However, it is impossible for the post office to carefully inspect every package submitted for mailing. It is still up to the sender to consciously abide by the rules and regulations and not mail dangerous items. Otherwise, burning other people's mail due to one's own violation is an extremely immoral act. The items prohibited by the post office have already been selectively announced in the newspaper. Everyone should pay special attention when mailing items in the future.

专栏：来信摘要

    大家不要邮寄危险物品编辑同志：
    二月十三日，有一袋由北京运往山西寿阳的邮包。因有人在邮件中邮寄砸炮，致挤压爆炸使邮包起火。幸发觉较早，邮件烧毁不多。邮局未详细查问就收寄这样的邮件，这是邮局的疏忽。但邮局对交寄的包件，有时不可能逐件仔细检查。还得靠寄件人自觉地遵守规章，不要邮寄危险物品。不然，因自己违章而烧毁别人的邮件，是一种极不道德的行为。邮局禁寄的物品，已择要在报上公布了。以后大家寄东西，应该特别注意。
