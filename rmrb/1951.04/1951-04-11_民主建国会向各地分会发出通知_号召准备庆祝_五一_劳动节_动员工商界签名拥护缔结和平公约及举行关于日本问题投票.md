　　(Reported by this newspaper) The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce issued a "Notice on Preparing for the Celebration of 'May Day' Labor Day and Conducting Signature Drives in Support of Concluding a Peace Pact and Voting on the Japan Issue" to its local branches on April 10. The main contents of the notice are as follows:

　　(1) In accordance with the methods stipulated by the China People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association, the Federation will systematically convene industry-specific and sub-sectoral forums or accusation meetings through the Federation of Industry and Commerce and hold signatures and votes at these meetings. Members of our association, especially those who have leadership responsibilities within the Federation of Industry and Commerce, should actively take on the responsibility of promoting and publicizing in various meetings, so that every industrialist, businessman, employee, and their families can participate in the signature and voting campaign and thoroughly understand the true meaning of this movement. This is the central link in the preparatory work for this year's "May Day" demonstration parade.

　　(2) On "May Day" Labor Day, grand demonstration parades will be held throughout the country. This parade contains the dual meaning of reviewing our own strength and demonstrating to imperialism. Local branches are requested to prepare early through the Federation of Industry and Commerce and vigorously mobilize. Around "May Day," various window displays related to current affairs and the "May Day" parade can be made in the windows of various stores. During the "May Day" parade, efforts can be made to create various eye-catching and moving, anti-American and patriotic programs. The business community is concentrated in the thoroughfares of the city, and its economic conditions are higher than those of workers, students, and ordinary citizens. In the signature voting and "May Day" demonstration parade, efforts should be made to ensure that the work of the business community is substantial and that a broader mass of people can be mobilized to participate, so as not to lag behind other sectors.

　　(3) "May Day" Labor Day is a festival for the world's working people to strive for liberation. Working people created the history of the human world, but they have always been subjected to exploitation and oppression. The exploitation and oppression suffered by the Chinese working people in the past was even more cruel. But finally, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the reactionary regime was overthrown and a new country led by the working class was established. In just over a year, our country's status has been raised to an unprecedented level, and everyone has seen an infinitely bright future. On this great festival, our business community should mobilize the masses that we can mobilize with the highest enthusiasm to participate in this demonstration parade. This not only expresses our gratitude to the working people for their great contributions to mankind and shows our intention of industrialists and businessmen to support the leading class, but also can improve our own political level and strengthen the spirit of unity and fraternity of the four classes in the common struggle, so that all the attempts of imperialism and its running dogs to sow discord will be completely bankrupt.

　　When carrying out this work, local branches are required to pay special attention to the following three points based on past experience and previous notices from the head office: First, in this great and arduous work, members of the China Democratic National Construction Association should play a leading and backbone role in the business community. However, the so-called leading and backbone role means that our members must actively take the lead in their own careers and industries and be good at encouraging others to do it together. As long as the business community is widely mobilized, it will be the greatest success of our association. Second, in the past, some mass movements, such as the collection of comfort and relief supplies and last year's peace signature movement, many branches did not popularize this movement to the vast industrial and commercial sectors through the Federation of Industry and Commerce, but limited it to their own members, and did not use the organizational strength of the various trade associations affiliated to the Federation of Industry and Commerce. The result was that the impact could not be expanded. This method is incorrect, and it is hoped that all branches will resolutely correct it in this signature voting movement. Third, in the past, the local industrial and commercial sectors' anti-American and patriotic activities, the branches rarely had detailed reports to the head office. It is hoped that in the future, the propaganda and education departments of each branch will write a systematic report to the head office at any time on major events launched by the industrial and commercial sectors. If this event is promoted by our China Democratic National Construction Association, it should be checked in a timely manner, and the experience we have gained in this event should be reported to the head office in detail for reference.

### 民主建国会向各地分会发出通知　号召准备庆祝“五一”劳动节　动员工商界签名拥护缔结和平公约及举行关于日本问题投票

　　民主建国会向各地分会发出通知
  　号召准备庆祝“五一”劳动节
  　动员工商界签名拥护缔结和平公约及举行关于日本问题投票
    【本报讯】民主建国会总会，于四月十日向该会各地分会发出“为准备庆祝‘五一’劳动节进行拥护缔结和平公约签名及关于日本问题投票的通知”，通知主要内容如下：
    （一）依照中国人民抗美援朝总会规定的办法，通过工商联合会有计划地召集分行分业的座谈会或控诉会并在会上举行签名及投票。我会会员，特别在工商联合会内负领导责任的会员，在各种会议中都应积极负起推动及宣传的责任，使每一个工商业者、从业人员以及他们的家属，都能参加签名及投票，并彻底明了这一运动的真正意义。这是今年“五一”示威游行准备工作的中心环节。
    （二）“五一”劳动节，全国各地均将举行盛大示威游行。这一游行，包含有检阅自己力量及向帝国主义示威的双重意义。要求各地分会透过工商联合会及早准备，大力发动。在“五一”前后，各商店的窗橱，可作各种与时事及“五一”游行有关的布置。在“五一”游行时，更可设法创造各种醒目动人、反美爱国的节目。工商界集中于城市通衢，经济条件高过于工人、学生及一般的市民；在签名投票及“五一”的示威游行中，都要争取工商界的工作能够做得充实，能够发动更广大的群众参加，不要落后于其他各界。
    （三）“五一”劳动节，是世界劳动人民争取解放的节日。劳动人民创造了人类世界历史，但他们却一直受着剥削与压迫。中国劳动人民过去所受的剥削与压迫，更为残酷。但终于在中国共产党及毛主席领导之下，推倒反动政权，建立了以工人阶级为领导的新国家。仅仅一年多的时间，我们国家的地位空前提高了，大家都看到了无限美好的将来。在这一伟大的节日，我们工商界应该以最高的热情，发动自己所能发动的群众，参加这一示威游行。这不但表示我们感谢劳动人民对人类的伟大贡献，表示我们工商业者拥护领导阶级的意向，而且可以在共同的斗争中，提高自己的政治水平，加强四个阶级的团结友爱精神，使帝国主义及其走狗们的一切挑拨离间的企图，归于彻底的破产。
    在进行这一工作时，要求各地分会根据过去经验及总会历次通知，特别注意下列三点：一、这一伟大艰巨的工作，民主建国会会员应该在工商界中起带头与骨干的作用。但所谓带头与骨干作用，是说我们会员要在自己的事业、行业中，积极率先并善于鼓动别人共同来做。只要工商界广泛动员起来了，就是我会的最大成功。二、过去有些群众性的运动，如募集慰劳救济品以及去年的和平签名运动等，很多分会都不是透过工商联合会把这一运动普及到广大的工商业中去，而是把它局限在自己的会员中，也不去利用工商联合会所属的各同业公会的组织力量，而只是由少数的会员去活动，结果影响反而不能扩大。这个方法是不对的，希望各分会在这次签名投票的运动中要坚决地纠正。三、过去各地工商界的反美爱国活动，各分会对总会都很少有详细报告。希望以后各分会的宣教部门对工商界所发动的意义重大的事件，随时都写一系统的报告给总会。如若这一事件，是由我们民主建国会所推动，并应该及时检查，把在这一事件中我们所取得的经验，详细报告给总会参考。
