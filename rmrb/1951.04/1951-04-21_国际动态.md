Japanese People Launch Movement to Defend Human Rights

Seeing that incidents of trampling on human rights are increasing day by day, the Japan Labor-Farmer Relief Society, the Association of Democratic Scientists, the Free Jurists League, the Tokyo Democratic National Front and other democratic groups and trade unions have designated March 15 to April 15 as "Human Rights Protection Month" and launched a movement to defend human rights. This movement should be combined with the patriotic movement demanding overall peace; because only by realizing overall peace can the basic rights of the Japanese people be guaranteed.

French People Regularly Hold Peace Congresses

The National Standing Committee of the French Association of Freedom Fighters for Peace held a special meeting in Paris on the 15th to discuss the current priority tasks of French peace fighters. The meeting decided to hold a National People's Congress in Paris on July 15 to support the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. It also passed a resolution on defining the tasks of French peace fighters and a resolution protesting the French government's ban on the activities of the World Peace Council in France.

U.S. House of Representatives Passes Extension of Current Military Service Act

The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on the 13th of this month by a vote of 372 to 44, stipulating that the current military service law be extended for another three years, the age of conscription be reduced to 18 and a half years, and the term of service for all soldiers (including those already enlisted) be set at 26 months.

Increase in Crime in the United States Last Year

J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, issued a statement stating that in 1950, there were 1,790,030 people who committed felonies in the United States, an increase of 1.5 percent compared to 1949. Arson and embezzlement were not included in the statistics. The above figures include 7,020 murder cases; 16,580 rape cases, 1,509,360 robbery cases, and more than 170,000 car theft cases. Hoover's statistics do not include bribery of government officials, buying and selling government positions, profiting from military surplus materials, or tax evasion by monopoly capitalists.
	
The increase in crime in the United States is one of the characteristics of the "American way of life" touted by the U.S. ruling group.
