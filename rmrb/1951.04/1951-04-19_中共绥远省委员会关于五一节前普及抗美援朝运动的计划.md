The current policy of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in Suiyuan Province is: to achieve popularization before May Day and to deepen it after May Day. It is imperative to ensure that every place and every person in the province receives this patriotic education and can actively participate in this patriotic movement. Although the popularization time in pastoral areas can be slightly extended, there are no exceptions to the popularization requirements.

The central content of this movement is: to oppose the United States' rearmament of Japan; to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army; and to support the declaration and various resolutions of the World Peace Congress Council regarding the conclusion of a peace covenant. At the same time, it is necessary to integrate it with the current central tasks such as spring plowing production and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, so as to vigorously promote the current central tasks through this movement.

How to achieve this popularization requirement?

One, the leading organs at all levels and in all systems should pay special attention to the significance of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, conduct serious discussions, formulate specific plans, and immediately begin implementation. All propaganda and cultural institutions and all public places must formulate propaganda work plans and immediately begin implementation.

Two, organize cadres to conscientiously study current affairs, give reports, conduct tests, and carry out accusations.

Three, universally establish People's Resist America, Aid Korea Associations at all levels and in all regions, and absorb people from all walks of life to participate. Party committees at all levels must send people to directly participate in the leadership, in order to powerfully lead the development of this movement and mobilize all possible organizational forces.

Four, it is necessary to mobilize all Party members, League members, and all cadres, and it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses through activists among the urban and rural people to actively participate in this patriotic movement.

Five, different requirements should be set for different regions.

In the cities of Guihua and Baotou, more attention should be paid to deepening the movement. Not only should study tests be held among cadres, but also small-scale symposiums should be held among people of all strata. Not only should those who have not yet signed patriotic pacts continue to be mobilized to sign them, but also the implementation of patriotic pacts should be earnestly discussed and inspected. Not only should city-wide representative meetings of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement be held, but also representative meetings of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement should be held separately for various industries and regions to carry out communication and specific deployment work. Not only should a city-wide people's parade and demonstration with workers as the main body be held on May Day, but also small-scale accusation meetings should be widely held before May Day; attention should be paid to mobilizing workers and their families to participate in the movement; and attention should be paid to mobilizing housewives and others to participate. Organ cadres should also actively participate in this movement to promote the movement forward.

In rural areas, attention should be paid to the popularization of the movement. In early April, cadres should conscientiously study current affairs. Learning should be combined with spring plowing production and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, either through concentrated lectures or regional reports, supplemented by discussions and tests.

In mid-April, the local Resist America, Aid Korea Associations and district reading newspaper committees should be organized. Reading newspaper team leaders should be trained once before mid-April. County-level joint meetings of primary school teachers should be widely convened. County or village-level farmer representative meetings should be widely convened, and Party meetings at all levels should also be convened. Through these meetings, communication and deployment should be carried out separately, and propaganda should be carried out by different people in different regions. At these meetings, signing votes, accusing the crimes of the Japanese invaders, the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, and formulating patriotic pacts should be carried out. In late April, through the farmers' association organization, small-scale symposiums for accusation, reminiscence, and comparison should be convened, and the formulation of village-wide, district-wide, and county-wide patriotic pacts should be brewed. On May Day, parades and demonstrations can be organized by village, town, or district units as much as possible, according to the specific situation. At this meeting, the current general political slogans can be combined simply and clearly to mobilize spring plowing production and suppress counter-revolutionaries.

In small towns, Resist America, Aid Korea Associations should be organized to lead the movement in the entire town. Primary school teachers and senior students can be mobilized to organize small propaganda teams. In areas where conditions permit, reporters or propagandists can be established to conduct regional or industry-specific reports; convene symposiums for all walks of life; hold small-scale exhibitions; and mobilize folk artists to carry out literary and artistic activities. The Resist America, Aid Korea movement in small towns is generally poorly developed, and due attention must be paid to it this time.

There are more difficulties in pastoral areas, and the popularization time can be slightly extended. The following methods can be adopted: such as convening representative meetings, holding ten-household head meetings in different regions, meetings of wolf-fighting hero models and activists, etc., and short-term training courses can be held to conduct accusations, signatures, and votes. Then, they can be used to carry out propaganda to the masses. General temple fairs must be used as much as possible. Parades and demonstrations are generally not necessary.

All people's organizations should first educate every member of their own, and then mobilize them to carry out mass propaganda.

Finally, it is necessary to establish a Party and non-Party propaganda network from this movement. Only in the movement can the propaganda network be better established. And only when the propaganda network is established can the movement be more popularized, and can the movement persist and be transformed from popularization to depth. The establishment of a propaganda network is the basic key to achieving popularization and deepening, and we must pay close attention to it.

　　中共绥远省委员会关于五一节前普及抗美援朝运动的计划
    目前绥远省抗美援朝运动的方针是：五一节前要求普及，五一节后要求深入，必须做到全省每一处每一人都受到这一爱国教育，都能积极参加这个爱国运动。牧业地区普及时间虽可稍为延长，但普及要求绝无例外。
    这一运动的中心内容为：反对美国重新武装日本；支援中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军；拥护世界和平大会理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言与各项决议。同时必须把目前的中心工作如春耕生产、镇压反革命，与之结合宣传，以求通过这一运动，有力地推动当前的中心工作。
    如何达到这一普及要求？
    一、各级、各系统的领导机关，应该特别重视抗美援朝运动的意义，加以认真讨论，做出具体计划，并即着手实施。一切宣传文化机构，一切公共场所，必须订出宣传工作计划，并即着手进行。
    二、组织干部认真进行时事学习、作报告、作测验、进行控诉。
    三、普遍建立各级、各地的人民抗美援朝会，吸收各界人士参加。各级党委必须派人直接参加领导，以便有力地领导这一运动的开展，并把一切可能组织的力量动员起来。
    四、必须把全体党员、团员和全体干部动员起来，必须通过城乡人民群众中的积极分子，去动员广大群众来积极参加这一爱国运动。
    五、对各个不同地区，应有不同要求。
    在归绥包头两市，应更多地注意深入。不仅在干部中举行学习测验，还应在各阶层人民中召开小型座谈会。不仅要继续发动未订立爱国公约的继续订立，而且要切实讨论、检查爱国公约的执行。不仅要召开全市性的抗美援朝的代表会，而且要接着分别召开各行业、各地区的抗美援朝代表会，以进行传达与具体布置工作。不仅在五一节要举行以工人为主体的全市人民的游行示威，而且要求在五一节前普遍召开小型控诉会；要十分注意发动工人及其家属参加运动；并注意动员家庭妇女等参加。机关干部亦应积极参加这一运动，推动运动前进。
    农村应注意运动的普及工作。四月初旬应切实进行干部时事学习。应结合春耕生产及镇压反革命的学习，或集中讲解，或分区报告，并辅以讨论与测验。
    四月中旬应将各地抗美援朝会，区的读报委员会组织起来。并在四月中旬以前把读报组长普训一次。以县为单位召集小学教员联席会。普遍召开县的或村的农民代表会，并且召开各级党的会议。通过这些会议，分别进行传达布置，分区分人进行宣传。并应在这些会议上举行签名投票和控诉日寇美蒋匪帮的罪行，订立爱国公约等。在四月下旬，通过农会组织，召开控诉、回忆、对比的小型座谈会，并酝酿制订全村、全区、全县的爱国公约。在五一节可按照具体情况，尽可能组织以村镇或区为单位的游行示威。在这个大会上，可简单明了地结合当前一般政治口号，动员春耕生产及镇压反革命。
    在小城镇应组织抗美援朝会，负责领导全城镇的运动。可发动小学教员及高年级学生组织小型宣传队。有条件的地区可建立报告员或宣传员，进行分区或分行业的报告；召集各界的座谈会；举行小型展览；发动民间艺人进行文艺活动等。小城镇的抗美援朝运动一般开展较差，此次必须予以应有注意。
    游牧区困难较多，普及时间可稍延长。可采取以下方式进行：如召开代表会，分区域召开什户长会，打狼英雄模范及积极分子会等，并可召开短期训练班，进行控诉、签名、投票。再通过他们向群众展开宣传。一般庙会必须尽量利用。游行示威一般不必举行。
    各人民团体应首先教育好自己的每一成员，然后再发动他们进行群众宣传。
    最后，必须从这一运动中，建立党的与非党的宣传网。只有在运动中才能更好地建立宣传网。也只有宣传网建立起来了，才能使运动更加普及，而且能够使运动坚持下去，由普及转入深入。建立宣传网是达到普及与深入的基本关键，我们必须十分注意。
