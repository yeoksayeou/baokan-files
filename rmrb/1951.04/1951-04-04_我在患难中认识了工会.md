　　I Understood the Union in Hardship
    Oral account by Yan Shusen, driver of Anyang Locomotive Depot, Zhengzhou Railway Bureau; written by Zhang Yuelin.
    I am a train driver at the Anyang Locomotive Depot of the Zhengzhou Sub-bureau of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau. My wife was suffering from a severe uterine tumor. I myself carelessly tripped and broke three left ribs while inspecting a locomotive, making me unable to work. Therefore, my wife and I went to Beijing for medical treatment together. My wife's illness was severe because I hadn't paid attention to treating it in the past. I always thought poor people would get better after a couple of days of illness, and besides, there was no money for treatment, and I didn't dare to borrow from the union. To be honest, at that time, I didn't believe in the union, and I didn't believe that labor insurance was real. So, I just kept enduring it. Later, seeing that my wife's illness was so severe, I couldn't bear it any longer, so I braced myself and went to the union. With the help of union cadres, I solved various difficulties, and my wife and I went to Beijing for treatment.
    Beijing is such a big place, and I didn't know anyone. All the way, I was worried about what unexpected difficulties I would encounter after arriving in Beijing.
    After arriving in Beijing, I went to the National Committee of the Railway Workers' Union of China. In the reception room there, a comrade surnamed Lin warmly greeted me. He immediately contacted the guest house by telephone. When we arrived at the guest house, a comrade Wu also greeted us very kindly, cleaned the room, borrowed bedding, and settled us in comfortably.
    At the guest house, I also met Huang Liang, the chairman of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau (my own bureau) union. I knew him, but he didn't know me. I called out to him and talked about bringing my wife to Beijing for treatment. He immediately remembered: "Oh! There is such a thing. Your grassroots union has already contacted the National Railway Federation of Trade Unions, but I didn't know when you would come. I didn't expect to meet you here. I will definitely visit your wife!" As he spoke, he pulled up a stool for me, poured water, and asked me all sorts of questions. Chairman Huang Liang seemed to know my worries very well. He sat down and said to me, "It doesn't matter, feel free to treat your wife. Now that our working class has been emancipated. Our lives are just as important as the lives of the rich in the past. We must never let workers with illnesses wait to die because they can't afford treatment. I will be responsible for the financial aspects." He also said many comforting words. At this time, I was so grateful that I almost cried.
    The next morning, Chairman Huang Liang personally took me to the Labor Protection Department of the National Railway Federation of Trade Unions. Minister Xiao Hongqi of the Labor Protection Department was also so warm when he saw me, comforting me and telling me to relax, and immediately gave me 5 million yuan.
    After coming out, Chairman Huang Liang accompanied me to see my wife. Walking on the road, I kept thinking: I am such a worker covered in oil, but when I come to Beijing, I am treated like a hero everywhere. If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us workers to stand up, how could there be such a world?
    Chairman Huang Liang's concern for the workers is something that never existed in the old society. I have been driving trains for more than 20 years, and I was always oppressed before liberation. After liberation, everyone said that the workers had been emancipated, but I didn't quite understand what the emancipation of the workers meant; everyone said that the union was the home of the workers, but I didn't believe it; now, I understand! The union is really our home, and the members of the union are all our relatives. Take our grassroots union for example, as soon as Chairman Liu Jinshan heard the news that I was treating my wife's illness, he immediately ran around, busily arranging letters of introduction, opening free tickets to contact the superior union, and even blamed me for not saying it earlier. When I was leaving and didn't have any money, Labor Protection Committee member Yang Xiu immediately found a way. Section Chief Xu also gave me 3 million yuan. The grassroots level is good, and the upper level is good. This time, my wife stayed in the hospital for more than three months, and it cost more than 4 million yuan in total, which was all solved with everyone's help. Especially Chairman Huang Liang, I will never forget him even in death! Here, I want to say from the bottom of my heart to the working brothers all over the country: Only the new China led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can care about us workers like this and value the interests of the workers. The union is really our workers' home.

### 我在患难中认识了工会

　　我在患难中认识了工会
    郑州铁路局安阳机务段司机阎树森口述  张玥琳代笔
    我是郑州铁路局郑州分区安阳机务段一个开车工人。我的爱人患着很重的子宫瘤症。我自己因在检查机车时不小心被拌倒，摔折了左肋骨三根，不能工作。因此，便和爱人一同去北京医治。我爱人病的沉重，是因为过去我不注意医治，我总觉得穷人病两天就会好的，而且治也没有钱，又不敢向工会去借。说实在的话，那时候我也不相信工会，更不相信劳动保险是真的。所以，便一直忍着。后来，看到爱人病的那么重，再不医治自己良心上实在过不去，我才硬着头皮去找工会。经过工会干部帮助我解决了各方面的困难，我才同我爱人去北京治病。
    北京地方那么大，我又不认识一个人，一路上，我只是担心到北京以后会遇到什么意外的困难。
    到北京后，我就去中国铁路工会全国委员会。在那里的传达室，一位姓林的同志亲热地招待我，他马上用电话和招待所联系。等我们到了招待所，一位吴同志也非常亲切地招待我们，收拾了屋子，借了行李，把我们安顿得妥妥适适的。
    在招待所，我又遇上了郑州铁路局（我的本局）工会黄亮主席。我认识他，他不认识我。我叫住他，谈起我带爱人来北京治病的事，他立即想起了：“噢！有这么回事，你们基层工会已经向全国铁路总工会联系了，可不知道你们什么时候来，想不到在这儿遇上了，我一定去看你的爱人！”他说着就给我搬凳子，倒水，拉着我问长问短。黄亮主席像很知道我的心事，他坐下来就同我说：“不要紧，放心给你爱人治病好了。现在我们工人阶级翻身了。我们的生命也跟过去有钱人的生命一样重要。绝不能像过去工人有病，治不起就得等着死。经济方面，我一定负责。”他还说了许多安慰我的话，这时候，我简直感激得要哭出来。
    第二天早上，黄亮主席就亲自带我去全国铁路总工会劳动保护部。劳动保护部萧洪启部长见到我，也是那么亲热，拉着我的手安慰我，叫我安心，并且当时就给了我五十万元。
    出来以后，黄亮主席又同我去看我的爱人。走在路上，我一直在想：我这样一个满身油泥的工人，来到北京，走到那儿都像是功臣一样受到爱戴。要不是共产党毛主席领导咱们工人翻了身，怎能有这样的天地？
    黄亮主席这样关心工人，真是旧社会里没有的事。我开车有二十多年了，解放前一直受压迫。解放后，都说工人翻身了，我还不大了解工人翻身是怎么回事；都说工会是工人的家，我不相信；现在，我可明白了！工会真是我们的家，工会的委员也都是我们的亲人。就拿我们基层工会来说，刘金山主席一听说我给爱人治病的消息，马上跑东跑西，张罗着开介绍信，开免票向上级工会联络，还直埋怨我不早说。走时没钱，劳动保护委员杨秀马上想办法。徐段长也给我拿了三十万元。基层基层好，上级上级好。这次我爱人在医院住了三个来月，总共化了四百多万元，都是大家帮助解决的。尤其是黄亮主席，至死我也不会忘记他！在这里，我向全国工人弟兄们说出自己心里的话：只有共产党毛主席领导的新中国才能这样关心咱们工人，重视工人的利益。工会真是我们工人的家。
