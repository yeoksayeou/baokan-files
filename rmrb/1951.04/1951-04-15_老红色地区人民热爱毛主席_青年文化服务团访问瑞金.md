People in the Old Red Areas Love Chairman Mao
     ——Youth Cultural Service Corps Visits Ruijin
    Liu Xiuzheng
    The people in Ruijin, the hometown of the revolution, have a special memory and love for their leader, Chairman Mao. When we went to any small village or mountain hollow, the young people, old women, children... all gathered around us and talked to us in broken Mandarin, asking us: "You are from Beijing, is Chairman Mao in good health?" Yang Yanxun, a disabled veteran of the Red Army, said to us: "I am most concerned about Chairman Mao. He suffered a lot during the Long March and damaged his health. He often coughs. Now that we have won, he is even busier with work. I don't know if his health is good?" We told them about the recent situation of Chairman Mao and the central leaders, and showed them Chairman Mao's portrait. They scrambled for it, pointing like children. An old woman surnamed Wang tremblingly held Chairman Mao's portrait and said, "It's him, it's him, the smile is still the same as before, now he has gained weight." Then the older ones talked about the scene more than a decade ago. They recalled the names of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the central leaders, as well as their deeds of struggle, and fondly recounted their subtle words and deeds, remembering them so clearly.
    Shazhouba is eight miles northwest of Ruijin City. It is a large village surrounded by many villages. It was the location of the Central Democratic Government during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. As soon as we arrived there, the county party committee conveyed the opinions of the local people to us: "We want to see Chairman Mao!" On January 25th, it was drizzling. We passed the newly paved road for welcoming us and met the township head at the entrance of the village. The township head was a poor peasant in his thirties. He took us to the front of the village and told us: the white house in front is the Land Department of the Central Democratic Government during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the right side is the Workers and Peasants Inspection Department, and the back is the Finance Department; the tile house in the west of the village is where Chairman Mao lived at that time. We walked into the house where Chairman Mao lived. The owner of the house is a strong man in his thirties. During the Second Domestic Revolution, he was still a child. He still remembers that Chairman Mao slept there and worked there. There are two large camphor trees on the right side of the house, where Chairman Mao often took a walk. When we came back, we saw the words "Support the Communist Party" and "Support the Red Army" carved on the back door frame with a knife. That night, our movie was shown in the pine forest on the red soil slope in front of the Land Department. They put forward the only opinion: "Please play the movie slower so that we can see Chairman Mao more."
    The day we went to Wuyang was a sunny day. The land reform here has been completed, and the farmers are organized. Along the way, there are militiamen with spears and Young Pioneers with red flags checking road passes.
    Wuyang is thirty miles away from Ruijin and was a model area during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. When we arrived there, the local Youth League members and folks set off firecrackers to welcome us, treating us like relatives, enthusiastically carrying machines to set up the venue. In the evening, several revolutionary old peasants and Red Army veterans came to us. They told us that when Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu went down to Jinggangshan and passed through here, the local farmers' association and revolutionary committee were organized to carry out land reform, and the enthusiasm of the masses was very high. When the Red Army was expanded in 1931, in five days, more than 400 young people in one district joined the Red Army. After the Red Army went north to resist Japan, the evil landlords who were overthrown during the land revolution returned, took away the farmers' land and cattle, and sold the Red Army's wives and children. The people of Ruijin suffered three massacres... But the people of Ruijin did not yield, and their hearts were still closely following Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. They carried out guerrilla activities in the difficult environment of blockade and "encirclement and suppression." They slept in the deep mountains, and without food, they often used wild vegetables and fruits to fill their hunger, persisting in the struggle. Finally, the hero with the red flag returned. Ruijin was liberated, and now it has returned to Chairman Mao's embrace. Shao Riwei, who had a scar on his eyebrow, took out the Chinese Communist Party membership card, the Red Army family preferential treatment certificate, the disability certificate, currency, and mimeographed documents, which they had risked their lives to treasure for more than ten years. Although these things have been eaten by bugs with thousands of holes, the owners truly regard them as family heirlooms. They gave these things to us. Under the oil lamp, the old township head Shao Fangling excitedly shed tears and said: "Please tell Chairman Mao, the Red Army is back. Now we have struggled against the landlords and bullies, and we have successfully carried out land reform. In the future, we must resolutely overcome all difficulties and do a good job in production!"
    The people in the old red areas love Chairman Mao so much. The older generation of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War era is leading the younger generation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, to overthrow the landlords and bullies who oppressed them, and to work hard to produce and create a free and happy life in the future.

　　老红色地区人民热爱毛主席
     ——青年文化服务团访问瑞金
    刘修正
    革命的故乡——瑞金的广大人民，对于自己的领袖毛主席是特别怀念和热爱的。当我们走到任何一个小村子和山坳里，那些年轻人、老婆婆，儿童们……都围拢我们，用生硬的普通话来和我们攀谈，问我们：“你们从北京来的，毛主席身体可好？”一个残废了的红军老战士杨衍埙跟我们说：“我最关心的是毛主席，他在长征的时候吃了很多苦，把身体搞坏了，常咳嗽，现在胜利了，他工作更忙，身体不知道好不好？”我们就把毛主席和中央各首长的近况告诉他们，并拿出毛主席的像给他们看。他们抢着，像孩子似地指点着。一个姓王的老妈妈颤巍巍地拿着毛主席的像说：“就是他，就是他，笑容还和从前一样，现在发福了。”于是年纪较大的就谈起十几年前的情景来。他们回忆着毛主席朱总司令和中央首长的姓名及斗争事迹，亲切地追述着他们细微的一举一动，记得那么清清楚楚。
    沙洲坝在瑞金城西北八里，是一个周围围绕着许多村落的较大的村庄，它是第二次国内革命战争时期中央民主政府所在地，我们刚到那里，县委就转告我们当地群众的意见：“要看看毛主席！”在一月二十五日，天下着蒙蒙的细雨。我们经过了为欢迎我们而新垫的汽车道，在村口碰到了乡长。乡长是一个三十来岁的贫农，他带着我们一同走到村子前面，告诉我们：前面那个白房子就是第二次国内革命战争时期中央民主政府的土地部，右侧是工农检查部，后面是财经部；村西头的瓦房就是当时毛主席住的地方。我们走进了那个毛主席住过的房子。房主是一个三十多岁的壮年人。第二次国内革命时，他还是一个小孩子，他还记得当时毛主席在那里睡觉，在那里办公。房子的右侧有二棵大樟树，毛主席经常在那里散步。我们回来时看见后门框子上还有小刀刻的字“拥护共产党”“拥护红军”。当晚我们的电影就是在土地部前红土坡的松林里放的。他们提出了唯一意见就是：“请电影放慢一点，让我们多看看毛主席。”
    去武阳的那天，是一个晴朗的天，这里的土地改革已将完成，农民们都组织起来了，沿路都有拿着镖枪的民兵，和拿着红旗的儿童团检查路条。
    武阳离瑞金三十里，是第二次国内革命战争时的模范区。当我们一到那里的时候，当地的青年团员和老乡们放起鞭炮欢迎我们，把我们当亲人看待，热情地抬着机器布置会场，傍晚几个革命的老农民和老红军来找我们。他们告诉我们：从毛主席朱总司令下井冈山经过这里的时候，当地就组织了农民协会、革命委员会，进行土地改革，群众的热情可高呢。当一九三一年扩大红军的时候，五天中，一个区就有四百多青年参加了红军。红军北上抗日后，土地革命运动时被打倒的恶霸地主又回来了，夺去了农民的土地、耕牛，卖掉了红军的老婆、孩子，瑞金人民先后遭受了三次大屠杀……但是瑞金人民并没有屈服，他们的心还是紧紧地跟随着毛主席朱总司令。他们在封锁和“清剿”的艰苦环境下，进行游击活动。露宿在深山，没有粮食，常用野菜野果充饥，坚持着斗争。终于那打着红旗的英雄又回来了。瑞金解放了，现在又回到毛主席的怀抱。那个眉梢上有一块伤疤的邵日炜，拿出他们冒着生命危险珍藏了十几年的中国共产党党证、红军家属优待证、残废证、货币和油印的文件等。虽然这些东西已被虫子蛀了千百个窟窿，但是物主真正把它们当成传家之宝。他们把这些东西送给我们，在油灯下，年老的邵方凌乡长兴奋地流着眼泪说：“请你们告诉毛主席，红军回来了，现在我们斗争了地主恶霸，已经胜利地进行着土地改革，今后要坚决克服一切困难，搞好生产！”
    老红色地区的人民是这样地热爱着毛主席。第二次国内革命战争时代的老一辈正领导着年青的一代，在共产党和人民政府领导下打倒了压迫他们的地主恶霸，努力生产，创造今后自由幸福的生活。
