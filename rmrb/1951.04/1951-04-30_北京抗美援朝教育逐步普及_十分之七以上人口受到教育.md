　　Beijing Anti-American, Aid-Korea Education Gradually Popularized
　  Over 70% of the Population Has Been Educated
    In the process of popularizing and deepening the anti-American, aid-Korea propaganda campaign, various districts in Beijing have widely adopted methods such as convening anti-American, aid-Korea representative conferences, symposiums, and accusation meetings, enabling the vast number of unorganized citizens to receive anti-American, aid-Korea education. Currently, according to statistics from the urban districts, an average of over 70% of the population has generally received anti-American, aid-Korea education at least once, while in the suburban areas, the figure reaches over 80%.

    Before the popularization and deepening of the anti-American, aid-Korea propaganda campaign, there were some blank spots in the propaganda in various districts of Beijing. These were mainly housewives and elderly people in small alleys and large courtyards, followed by small vendors and handicraft workers. This was because the anti-American, aid-Korea propaganda work in the past few months was mainly carried out among organized masses in schools and factories, and only temporary propaganda was carried out for scattered citizens, which was neither widespread nor deep enough.

    In view of this situation, in the past month, various districts in Beijing have particularly emphasized carrying out popular anti-American, aid-Korea propaganda work among residents, so that every place and everyone can be educated. Initially, various districts also encountered some specific difficulties in carrying out this work. The main difficulty was that there were not enough propaganda cadres, making it difficult to ensure that every scattered citizen received anti-American, aid-Korea education in a short period of time. Later, after careful research and discussion, many forms and methods convenient for residents to receive propaganda were devised to carry out this work. The following are some of the better methods:

    The first method is to convene anti-American, aid-Korea representative meetings on a street and alley basis, and to cultivate activists among the residents' representatives to carry out propaganda to the residents. For example, before launching the residents' propaganda work in this section, the Ninth Police Station of the Fifth District first convened an anti-American, aid-Korea representative meeting. The original residents' representatives, women representatives, representatives of families of revolutionary soldiers, heads of health teams, and grassroots cadres of various groups in each street all attended the meeting. At the meeting, the staff of the police station first made a brief current affairs report, and then encouraged the representatives to speak and discuss. During the discussion, in addition to studying the current political situation and the anti-American, aid-Korea issue themselves, the representatives also proposed plans to carry out propaganda work in their respective residential areas after returning. Therefore, this police station solved the difficulty of insufficient propaganda power.

    The second method is to mobilize cadres of various agencies, teachers and students of schools, and staff of police stations to directly go to the residents to hold small-scale anti-American, aid-Korea symposiums, accusation meetings, group meetings, courtyard meetings, parent meetings, get-togethers, and conduct family visits. Fengtai Town in the suburbs has more than 17,000 residents. During the spring vacation, more than 30 students from Tsinghua University came to the town to conduct propaganda. The local CPC District Committee mobilized more than 100 activists among the residents to cooperate with them, and successively held nearly 100 residents' symposiums, educating more than 14,000 residents. Many districts also adopted the method of convening meetings in batches, so that residents could take turns taking care of their homes and attending meetings. Some places also went to the residents' courtyards to hold courtyard meetings, so that residents could attend meetings and take care of their families. Residents felt familiar with the people and were willing to speak.

    The third method is to widely organize listening to the radio, exhibiting pictures and cartoons, and showing slides. The general public welcomes these forms of propaganda very much. The Seventeenth Police Station of the Third District showed slides for two days. When showing the slides, someone explained the content of the slides. The composition of the slides was simple and clear, and the content was easy to understand. Many housewives were very moved when they saw the slides of American and Japanese imperialism massacring the Chinese and Korean people.

### 北京抗美援朝教育逐步普及  十分之七以上人口受到教育

　　北京抗美援朝教育逐步普及
　  十分之七以上人口受到教育
    北京市各区在普及和深入抗美援朝宣传运动中，广泛采用召开抗美援朝代表会、座谈会、控诉会等方式，使广大无组织的市民普遍受到抗美援朝的教育。现在，根据城内各区的统计，平均百分之七十以上的人口已普遍受到一次以上的抗美援朝教育，郊区则达百分之八十以上。
    在普及和深入抗美援朝宣传运动未展开之前，北京市各区都存在着一些宣传的空白点、主要是小胡同和大杂院里的家庭妇女和老年人，其次，是小商贩和手工业工人。因为过去几个月来的抗美援朝宣传工作，主要是在学校、工厂等有组织的群众中进行，对分散的市民只是进行临时性的宣传，既不够普及，也不够深入。
    针对着这种情况，最近一个月来，北京市各区特别强调要在居民中展开普及的抗美援朝宣传工作，要使每一处每一人都能受到宣传。最初，各区在开展这一工作的过程中，也曾遇到一些具体的困难。主要的困难是宣传干部人数不够，因此很难在短短的时间内做到使每一位分散的市民都受到抗美援朝的教育。后来，经过认真研究和讨论，最后还是想出了许多便利于居民接受宣传的形式和方法来展开了这项工作。这些方法较好的有以下几种：
    第一种方法是以街道胡同为单位召开抗美援朝代表会议，在居民代表中培养积极分子向居民进行宣传。如第五区第九派出所在展开本段的居民宣传工作之前，首先召开了一次抗美援朝代表会议。各街道原有的居民代表、妇女代表、革命军人家属代表、卫生组长和各团体基层干部都参加了这次会议。在这次会议上先由该所工作人员作了简单的时事报告，然后启发各个代表发言讨论。在讨论中，各代表除了自己研究了当前政治形势和抗美援朝的问题外，并纷纷提出回去以后按自己居住的地区进行宣传工作的计划。因此，这个派出所就解决了宣传力量不足的困难。
    第二种方法是发动各机关干部、学校师生和派出所工作人员直接到居民中去开小型的抗美援朝座谈会、控诉会、片儿会、院会、家长会、联欢会和进行家庭访问。郊区丰台镇有一万七千多居民，春假期中，有清华大学学生三十多人到镇上来进行宣传。当地中共区委员会动员居民中的积极分子一百多人配合他们，先后召开了将近一百次的居民座谈会，使一万四千多居民受到了教育。许多区还采取分批召开的办法，使居民能轮流看家和参加会议。有些地方还到居民的院里去开院会，使居民既能来参加会议，又能够照顾家庭。居民感到人熟，也愿意讲话。
    第三种方法是广泛组织收听广播，展览图片、漫画，放映幻灯。一般市民对这些宣传形式都非常欢迎。第三区第十七派出所曾放映幻灯两天，放映的时候，有人讲解幻灯片的内容。幻灯片的构图简单明了，内容浅近易懂，很多家庭妇女看到美、日帝国主义屠杀中国人民和朝鲜人民的幻灯片的时候，很受感动。
