Investigation of Anti-American and Aid-Korea Propaganda Work in a Street in Jinzhou
	Striving to Popularize the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
	Propaganda Department of the Jinzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
	Jinzhou's Fukang Street includes the two natural streets of Fukang and Sanbao, fifty-eight administrative groups, one thousand five hundred and twenty-four households, and seven thousand and ninety-eight people, of which children under six years old and old men over sixty years old account for about two thousand; staff members, clerks and students, teachers, and other organized masses of organs and public enterprises account for one thousand four hundred; general residents account for about three thousand seven hundred; five party members, all of whom are street committee members, and the secretary of the party branch is the director of the war support committee; one night school, which has recently expanded its enrollment to one hundred and seven students; nine street propagandists; three hundred members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; seven members of the Women's Federation. The street mass organizations are very sound and have dedicated personnel in charge. Most of the residents are engaged in commerce, private iron industry, wood industry, peddling, cart drivers, tricycle drivers, etc., and mostly rely on labor to make a living. Half of the residents are illiterate, and propaganda work had no foundation in the past, and the masses were not very willing to come to meetings.
	At the beginning of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea propaganda work in Fukang Street, the director of the War Support Committee first convened twenty people, including street committee members, the head of the police station, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Women's Federation, and the heads of various street mass organizations, to form a preparatory committee, and put forward a plan and purpose: "To stimulate the masses' hatred of American imperialism through grievance meetings, and to formulate patriotic covenants on the basis of the masses' patriotic enthusiasm." The specific steps were to first convene a joint meeting of group leaders to convey the significance of the movement, understand the ideological situation of the masses, and conduct grievance sessions on the spot to improve the group leaders' understanding and experience in methods. Then, they were divided into groups of three or four to hold small-scale grievance meetings. Immediately afterwards, a group discussion was held to guide the masses' hatred towards American imperialism and turn it into practical action, and to deliberate on the formulation of patriotic covenants. In terms of leadership methods: the preparatory committee clearly divided the responsibilities internally, maintained close contact with the propaganda personnel of the organs, met before and after the meetings to discuss working methods and deviations, and held criticism meetings when major problems occurred.
	From March 3rd to the end of March, a total of nineteen accusation meetings were held, attended by a total of one thousand one hundred and fifty-four people, and five hundred and thirty-three people participated in the accusations. There were twenty cases of homicide in the accusation materials, of which two more prominent materials have been drawn into comic strips to promote to the masses. Group discussions were held thirty-five times before and after, with one thousand six hundred and thirty-one participants. Twenty-one groups have not yet completed the meetings, and the groups that have already held meetings have generally put forward preliminary conditions for the formulation of patriotic covenants. In addition, in order to eliminate blind spots, four "special meetings" were specifically convened to absorb those who often did not attend any meetings, a total of one hundred and thirty-eight people, to carry out propaganda and education. Four large-scale criticism meetings were held among the cadres to resolve the cadres' understanding of the movement and some problems in methods.
	In total, Fukang Street held fifty-eight meetings in twenty-eight days, averaging two meetings per day, and each group held more than two meetings. The total number of people attending the meetings reached two thousand nine hundred and twenty-three, accounting for 80% of the population that could possibly attend the meetings (some of these people are duplicates).
	After investigation and understanding, the following problems were found in the Anti-American and Aid-Korea propaganda work in Fukang Street:
	1. Street cadres rarely delve into the masses to investigate and study the degree of acceptance by the masses. Generally, they engage in propaganda without asking about the effect. Therefore, when checking the work and asking about the effect, they are either vague or exaggerating. There is a tendency of formalism in the work. Fukang Street held fifty-eight meetings against the American arming of Japan in twenty-eight days, and one-fifth of the masses did not know what the arming of Japan was about.
	2. Middle-aged women have the worst understanding. There may be two reasons for this: (1) In general, men are out doing small business, while women manage the household, washing clothes, cooking, and taking care of children, and do not have free time. Therefore, most of the meetings are attended by men, or old people and children. They rarely have the opportunity to participate in meetings. In fact, it can be seen in various meetings that middle-aged women account for the least number. (2) Seven or eight out of ten people who attend the meetings do not convey the information. Old people and children generally do not remember everything they hear at the meetings, and the men of the house feel that this matter does not need to be told to the old women. Therefore, they receive the least propaganda and education, almost none.
	3. Some old women have a clearer understanding of current events. There are two reasons for this: one is that they often attend meetings, and the other is that their sons or grandsons are in middle school or elementary school, or are cadres, and often propagate to them. We should attach importance to the propaganda power of students and cadres, and we should strengthen leadership over them to make it a regular and important form of propaganda.
	4. Most ordinary people like to listen to current events and also hope to know about national affairs, but they reflect: "When listening to others, it seems like they understand it very well, but they forget it afterwards." This certainly shows that propaganda is a long-term process of ideological education, and it is not something that can be fully effective overnight, but it also shows that our speeches are not sufficiently combined with the lives of the masses, or that we are conducting propaganda divorced from the lives of the masses, and therefore the impression left on the masses is not deep.
	In the Anti-American and Aid-Korea propaganda work in Fukang Street, they organized a preparatory committee (or it would be more appropriate to call it a propaganda committee) to unify the planning and leadership of this propaganda work, with specific purposes and steps, and established a system (such as brainstorming meetings, criticism meetings), organized forces, and enabled the street committee members to give full play to their high degree of enthusiasm, so that the movement could be deepened step by step in a purposeful and step-by-step manner, rather than blindly carrying out activities. Because there is a certain system, they improved their working methods, such as correcting the bias of "whoever finishes complaining first leaves first" through criticism meetings, as well as the idea that some cadres believe that propaganda will definitely affect their work. In addition, work was discussed at any time during brainstorming meetings, which reduced deviations in the work, and there were relatively detailed records of each meeting, which facilitated inspection, statistics, and summary. Fukang Street often paid attention to some people who did not attend meetings in the propaganda work. In addition to holding "special meetings," for example, if someone did not attend the meeting held by their group today, they would be invited to attend the meeting of another group tomorrow. As a result, the average attendance rate per group used to be only twelve or thirteen people, but later it averaged twenty people per group. Close contact with propaganda personnel of the organs enabled the propaganda work in Fukang Street to be carried out smoothly. The propaganda personnel of the organs did not just wait for the street committee members to gather the masses and give a speech, but worked with the street committee members to seriously discuss working methods and approaches. The propaganda personnel understood the principles more, and the street cadres were familiar with the ideology and living conditions of the masses. The combination of the two can make the meeting a success. Fukang Street did a good job in this regard. The group leaders mobilized and gathered the masses, the street cadres personally helped to control the meeting place, and held grievance meetings. First, the propaganda personnel explained the current situation, then held discussions, and then the activists took the lead in complaining (the targets were found in advance, those who had grievances to complain about). After the complaining was over, the propaganda personnel explained it again, mainly to lead the hatred to American imperialism, thereby strengthening the masses' hatred of American imperialism. However, judging from the ratio of the total number of people attending the grievance meetings in Fukang Street to the number of people complaining, it accounted for about one-half. On average, twenty-eight people complained at each meeting. It can be imagined that it was not a focused complaint, and there was a bit of a tendency to "squeeze out complaints." This is because the cadres' understanding of the grievance meetings was not clear enough in their minds, and they were satisfied with the large number of people complaining. Therefore, they failed to shift the focus of the meeting to hating American imperialism and implementing it into practical action at the time when the masses' emotions were at their highest after a very moving complaint. Secondly, the propaganda methods were very simple, only meetings were held, many meetings were held, and progress was very slow. First, grievance meetings were held universally, and then they felt it was not enough, and then they held discussions again from the beginning, deliberating on practical actions and formulating patriotic covenants, without conducting focused complaints and striking while the iron was hot to formulate patriotic covenants, which reduced the propaganda effect. The propaganda personnel or cadres did not focus on raising and solving problems in their speeches, and the time was long, which affected the emotions of the masses and did not leave a deep impression on the masses. This is what the masses reflected: "It seems like they understand it very well at the time, but they forget it afterwards."

　　锦州市一个街的抗美援朝宣传工作调查
　  为普及抗美援朝运动而斗争
    中共锦州市委宣传部
    锦州阜康街包括阜康、三保两个自然街，五十八个行政组，一千五百二十四户，七千零九十八人，其中六岁以下的孩子和六十岁以上的老头约占二千人；机关、公营企业职员店员及学生、教员等有组织的群众占一千四百人；一般居民约有三千七百人；党员五名，全是街道委员，党支部书记是战勤委员会主任；一所夜校，新近扩充学员达一百零七人；街道宣传员九名；中苏友好协会会员三百人；妇女联合会委员七名。街道群众组织都很健全，有专人负责。居民当中多从事商业、私营铁工业、木业、小贩、马车夫、三轮车夫等，大都是靠劳动为生。文盲占居民半数，过去宣传工作没有基础，开会时群众不大爱来。
    阜康街的抗美援朝宣传工作，开始时，首先由战勤委员会主任召集街道委员、派出所长、中苏友好协会、妇女联合会、各街道群众组织的负责人共二十名，成立筹委会，提出计划和目的：“通过诉苦会，激发群众对美帝国主义的仇恨，在群众爱国热情的基础上订立爱国公约”。具体步骤为，先召开小组长联席会，传达运动的意义，了解群众的思想情况，并当场进行诉苦，提高小组长的认识，和方式方法上的体会，然后分片，以三、四个组为单位，举行小型诉苦会。紧接着再召开小组座谈会，把群众的仇恨引导到美帝国主义身上，并使之化为实际行动，酝酿订立爱国公约。在领导方法上：筹委会内部明确分工负责，和机关宣传员密切联系，会前会后碰头，研讨工作办法和偏差，遇有大的问题则开检讨会。
    从三月三日到三月底，共计开过十九次控诉会，参加的人数共达一千一百五十四人，参加控诉的有五百三十三人，控诉材料中有二十件人命案，其中两件比较突出的材料已画成连环画，向群众进行宣传。小组座谈会前后开过三十五次，参加人数为一千六百三十一人，尚有二十一个组未开完，凡是已经开过会的组，大抵都提出了订立爱国公约的初步条件。此外，为了消灭死角，专门召开了四次“特别会”，吸收了那些经常不参加任何会的人，共一百三十八人，进行宣传教育。在干部中间开了四次大型检讨会，解决了干部对运动的认识和一些方式方法上的问题。
    总计阜康街在二十八天内召开了五十八次会，平均每天有两个会，每个组都开过两次会以上。参加会的总人数达二千九百二十三人，占可能参加开会的人口百分之八十（这里面有些人是重复的）。
    经调查了解在阜康街的抗美援朝宣传工作中发现以下问题：
    一、街道干部很少深入群众调查研究群众接受的程度，一般的都是搞宣传，不问效果，所以，当检查工作问到效果时，不是含糊其词，就是扩大其词，工作中存在着形式主义的倾向。阜康街在二十八天内开了五十八个反对美国武装日本的会，还有五分之一的群众不知道武装日本是什么回事。
    二、中年妇女认识最差，这可能有两个原因：（一）一般家庭都是男人在外边作小买卖，妇女经营家务、洗衣、作饭、带孩子，没有闲工夫，所以开会多半是男人去，或是老人小孩去，她们很少有参加会的机会，实际在各种会上也看到，中年妇女占最少数。（二）开会的人回来，十有七、八不作传达，老人小孩开会一般的都是记不全，当家的男人觉得这个事用不着告诉老娘们知道。因之她们受到的宣传教育最少，几乎没有。
    三、有的老大娘对时事认识较清楚，有两种原因，一种是经常参加开会，另一种是自己的儿子、孙子念中学或小学，或者是当干部，经常向他们宣传的结果。我们应该重视学生、干部这股宣传力量，而且应该对他们加强领导，使它成为经常的重要宣传方式之一。
    四、大多数老百姓爱听时事，也希望知道国家大事，但他们反映：“听人家讲的时候，心里也像挺明白，但过后就忘了。”这固然说明了宣传是长期的思想教育过程，不是一朝一夕就可完全收效的事，但也说明我们的讲话和群众的生活结合的不够，或者是脱离了群众的生活而进行宣传，因之留给群众的印象不深。
    在阜康街的抗美援朝宣传工作中，他们组织了筹委会（或者叫宣传委员会更恰当些），统一计划和领导这一宣传工作，有一定的目的和步骤，又规定了制度（如碰头会、检讨会），组织力量，使各街道委员发挥了高度的积极性，有目的有步骤地使运动能逐级深入，不是盲目乱搞。因为有一定的制度，使他们改进了工作方法，如通过检讨会纠正了“谁先诉完谁先走”的偏向，以及个别干部认为宣传一定影响工作的想法。另外，在碰头会上随时研讨工作，使工作减少了偏差，并且每次会都有比较详细的记录，便于检查、统计和总结。阜康街在宣传工作中经常注意到不参加会的一些人，除了召开“特别会”以外，比如今天某某没有参加本组召开的会，明天还请他去参加别组的会，因之从前开会的出席率平均每组只不过十二、三人，后来平均达到每组二十人。和机关宣传员的密切联系，使得阜康街的宣传工作得以顺利开展。机关宣传员并不是等街道委员把群众召集好，前去一讲了事，而是和街道委员在一起，认真研讨工作的方法、方式。宣传员道理懂得多，街道干部熟悉群众的思想、生活情况，两者结合起来，才能把会开好。阜康街在这一点上做得很好。小组长动员召集群众，街道干部亲临帮助掌握会场，开诉苦会，先由宣传员讲解一下目前形势，然后座谈，再由积极分子带头诉苦（事先找好对象，有苦可诉者），诉苦完了后，再由宣传员讲解一番，主要是把仇恨引到美帝国主义身上，因此加强了群众对美帝国主义的仇恨。但是，从阜康街参加诉苦会的总人数和诉苦人数的比例上看，约占二分之一，平均每次会上有二十八个人诉苦，可以想像不是有重点的诉苦，多少有点“硬挤苦”的偏向，这是因为干部在思想里对诉苦会的认识不够明确，以诉苦人数多为满足，因之就没能在一个非常感动人的诉苦之后，群众情绪最高昂的时候，把会议中心转到仇恨美帝国主义和贯彻到实际行动上去。其次，宣传方式很简单，只是开会，会开得很多，进展很慢，先是普遍召开了诉苦会，然后又觉得不足，又从头召开了座谈会，酝酿实际行动，订立爱国公约，没有进行重点的诉苦和趁热打铁订立爱国公约，减低了宣传效果。宣传员或者干部讲话，没有重点的提出问题，解决问题，时间长，因此影响了群众的情绪，给群众的印象不深，这就是群众所反映的：“当时听着像是很明白，可过后就忘了。”
