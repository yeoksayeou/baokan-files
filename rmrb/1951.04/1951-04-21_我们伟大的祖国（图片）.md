Our Great Motherland
Two years ago today, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, acting on the orders of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, crossed the Yangtze River and then quickly occupied Nanjing, overthrowing the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and liberating the south of the Yangtze River and all of China. This is the Yangtze River near Nanjing today. Looking at these countless sailboats, one is reminded of the scene of the PLA warriors crossing the river on thousands of sails back then.

    我们伟大的祖国
    二年前的今天，中国人民解放军执行毛主席、朱总司令的命令，横渡长江，继而迅速占领南京，推翻国民党的反动统治，解放江南和全中国。这是现在南京附近的长江江面。看这无数帆船，令人忆起当年解放军勇士们千帆渡江的情景。
