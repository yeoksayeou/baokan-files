　　Beijing Municipal People's Government Accepts Suggestions
    To the Editor:
    We believe that the suggestion made by Comrade Lü Zongxian of Nankai University, published in your newspaper on March 15th, regarding the rectification of the indiscriminate pasting of advertisements in our city's streets, is excellent. In addition to adjusting the existing billboards, the Municipal Construction Bureau has added one hundred new billboards, which have been installed in various needed locations for the purpose of posting advertisements. In the future, those who violate the regulations and paste advertisements indiscriminately will be strictly dealt with by the Public Security Bureau.

　　北京市人民政府接受建议
    整饬街头广告增设广告牌编辑同志：
    贵报三月十五日刊载了南开大学律宗宪同学所提关于整饬本市街头乱贴广告的建议。我们认为这个建议很好。市建设局除调整旧有广告牌外，又新增广告牌一百面，分别在各需要地点装设，以供张贴广告。今后如仍有违犯规定乱贴广告者，将由公安局严加取缔。
            北京市人民政府
