　　Supporting Striking Workers Against Imperialist Plunder
　  Large-Scale Student Demonstration in Iranian Capital
　  Abadan Oil Workers Persist in Strike
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 25th] According to TASS, Tehran: 20,000 university and high school students in Tehran, defying the Iranian authorities' ban, held a mass demonstration in Tehran on April 22nd in support of the striking workers in Khuzistan.

    The demonstration was welcomed by the residents of Tehran as it passed through the streets towards the Parliament Building. The demonstrators held many placards and long banners with slogans written on them, and carried portraits of the four students from the vocational school attached to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company who were killed in the bloody incident in Abadan.

    The demonstrating students held a rally in Bakharis Square, which passed a resolution demanding unconditional acceptance of all the demands of the striking workers in Abadan, immediate lifting of martial law in Khuzistan, punishment of the perpetrators of the Khuzistan bloodshed, withdrawal of British warships from the Persian Gulf, immediate implementation of the law nationalizing the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's enterprises, prohibition of British and American plunder of Iranian oil in Khuzistan and the Bahrain Islands, and declaration that any decisions made by the British and Americans in the Washington negotiations on the Iranian oil issue are illegal and invalid.

    Recognizing the mass nature of the demonstration and the enthusiastic sympathy of the residents of Tehran for the students, the police authorities had to give up using force and dared not disperse the demonstration and the rally.

    Meanwhile, the strike of 27,000 workers of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in Abadan, southern Iran, is continuing. The Iranian authorities are sending more troops to Abadan, and the number of troops gathered there is no less than a division. However, many of these troops sympathize with the strike. On April 12th, a soldier who refused to fire on the demonstration was shot dead by his squad leader. An officer and several soldiers were arrested for refusing to fire on the striking workers. In Isfahan and Bandar-e Mahshahr, the authorities also shot and arrested police and soldiers who were unwilling to fire.

    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社德黑兰消息：德黑兰的大学和高中学生两万人，不顾伊朗当局的禁令，于四月二十二日在德黑兰举行群众示威游行，支持库齐斯坦的罢工工人。
    示威游行队伍在通过街道向议会大厦前进时，受到德黑兰居民的欢迎。示威的人们手持许多标语牌和上面写着口号的长旗，并抬着前在阿巴丹血腥事件中被杀死的英伊石油公司附设职业学校的四个学生的画像。
    示威学生在巴克哈里斯广场举行集会，会议通过决议，要求无条件答应阿巴丹罢工工人的全部要求，立即解除库齐斯坦的戒严，惩办库齐斯坦血案的凶手，英国军舰自波斯湾撤退，立即实施把英伊石油公司的企业收归国有的法律，禁止英美劫夺库齐斯坦及巴林群岛上的伊朗石油，并宣布英美在华盛顿举行的伊朗石油问题谈判中作出的任何决定都是非法与无效的。
    警察当局认识到示威游行的群众性和德黑兰居民对学生的热烈同情，不得不放弃使用武力，不敢驱散示威游行和大会。
    同时，伊朗南部阿巴丹英伊石油公司二万七千名工人的罢工仍在继续中。伊朗当局正在增派部队到阿巴丹，聚集在该地的部队已不下一师人。但是这些军队中也有不少人是同情罢工的。四月十二日，一个拒绝向游行示威队伍开枪的士兵被班长击毙。一个军官和几个士兵因拒绝向罢工工人开枪而被捕。在伊斯法罕和班达·玛沙，当局也枪杀和逮捕了不愿开枪的警察和士兵。
