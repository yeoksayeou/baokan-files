Editor's Note: The experience of the popular newspaper Changsha Dazhong Bao is very good. Popularization is one of the most important issues in current newspaper and publishing work. Due to the lack of popularization, most newspapers and publications remain in the hands of a small group of people, failing to truly penetrate among workers and farmers and become their advisors and assistants in their daily work and lives. On the other hand, workers and farmers severely lack reading materials suitable for their needs. This is a serious and intolerable phenomenon in newspaper and publishing work. This phenomenon must be resolutely changed. "Book and Newspaper Review" will continue to discuss this issue, and we hope that editors, writers, distributors, and readers from all over the country will express their opinions and provide information about this area.

I.

Changsha Dazhong Bao was formed by merging two relatively progressive evening newspapers in Hunan before liberation—Shijian Bao and Wanwan Bao. It was originally named Dazhong Wanbao, targeting urban workers and students as its main audience while also considering the business community. It achieved some success in coordinating with urban movements and popularizing the newspaper. However, during its private operation, the newspaper faced difficulties: its target audience was not clear enough, its circulation was low (only about 1,500 copies), and it suffered significant monthly losses. Although the government had provided support to this private newspaper in various ways, it remained in difficulty due to its inability to increase sales. In June of last year, Hunan held its first provincial farmers' representative conference. The newspaper proactively proposed to the conference that it would dedicate the newspaper to the farmers of the province to cooperate with the Hunan land reform movement and serve the cause of social reform and construction in rural Hunan. The conference accepted this proposal, and in August of last year, it was transformed on its original basis into a popular newspaper targeting all farmers in the province.

This change brought about rapid and vibrant development for the newspaper. By January of this year, it had reached a circulation of over 38,000 copies, and it received approximately 1,500 to 2,000 submissions each month. There were approximately 800 rural correspondents, district and township cadres, and active writers who regularly wrote for the newspaper. Because it publicized the Party's policies in rural areas, initially connected with rural masses, cooperated with land reform and production movements, and provided timely education on current affairs in rural areas, and because the language was popular and easy to understand, it was enthusiastically welcomed by the masses of farmers. Currently, the township with the most subscriptions has reached over 200 copies, with each farmers' association group receiving three to five copies.

Dazhong Bao shares office space with Xin Hunan Bao, and its printing, management, and distribution (handled by the post office) are uniformly managed by Xin Hunan Bao. Therefore, its organization is very simple: it only has one editorial department with a total of 22 staff members. The overall leadership of the editorial department consists of an editorial committee at the top and a general editor's office below, which are divided into five groups: farmers' movement, agricultural production (including urban-rural economy), farmers' life, current affairs information, and communication. The working method is "integration of editing and communication," where the editorial committee formulates the overall editorial policy and reporting plan, which are then executed by the general editor's office and various groups.

The experience of Dazhong Bao over the past five months has proven that it is possible and necessary to publish a popular farmers' newspaper under the direct leadership of the main provincial newspaper. Due to certain limitations, the main provincial newspaper often cannot meet and suit the specific needs of farmers. In a state where the farmers' newspaper and the main provincial newspaper are separate, reporting often easily becomes repetitive and confusing. However, by running such a newspaper under the direct leadership of the main provincial newspaper, the division of labor can be well resolved. For example, in the current land reform movement, Xin Hunan Bao grasps the overall ideological and policy leadership, while Dazhong Bao focuses on educating and mobilizing the farmers. Doing so will not only not hinder the mass nature of the main provincial newspaper but will also help the main provincial newspaper connect with the masses; it will not only not reduce the circulation of the main provincial newspaper but will further increase circulation.

Because Dazhong Bao is located with Xin Hunan Bao, it saves a lot of management costs and is also easier to achieve self-sufficiency.

II.

In the past five months of work at Dazhong Bao, due to the staff's unfamiliarity with the rural situation, the vast majority lacked practical movement knowledge and experience, their mass perspective was not strong, and their policy level was low. Therefore, many shortcomings still exist, but its experience in the following three aspects is worth introducing:

First, how to combine guidance and mass character. On this issue, we have taken some detours. When the newspaper was first revised, the editorial department realized that this newspaper was for farmers, and the newspaper must be filled with the voices and works of the masses of farmers. However, at that time, there were not many farmers writing for the newspaper, so the newspaper tried its best to adopt their manuscripts and reflect their lives. It was soon discovered that this kind of reflection was not closely linked to the movement, could not grasp the important aspects of the lives, thoughts, and feelings of the farmers, and its guidance was very weak. Later, attention was paid to strengthening the guidance of the newspaper. During this period, the combination with autumn harvest, seed selection, seed retention, fertilizer accumulation, autumn and winter plowing, and the mobilization of the masses in the land reform movement, as well as the promotion of policies, was generally relatively close. However, another extreme was taken, with too much space devoted to reporting on the activities of cadres and a relaxation of activities of the masses. For example, when promoting the policy of "whoever sows reaps," the newspaper had many news items that always reported first on how the cadres held meetings, and then when the masses understood the policy, they planted so many radishes, rapeseed, and grass seeds. A pile of figures was used to replace the actual activities of the masses, or they were some vague concepts lacking specific individual examples, and the activities of the masses were equally invisible. For example, in reporting on the mobilization of the masses in the land reform, it was also about how the cadres went to the countryside, how they held meetings, and what they said, and that the masses understood this and figured it out, etc., but rarely integrated the policy into the level of consciousness and actual actions of the masses. The expression on the page was dull and lacking in vitality. At this time, readers made comments: "The newspaper only talks about land reform, talks about production, and tells short stories, which is not interesting." The editorial department carefully studied the readers' opinions and found that land reform must be talked about, and production must be talked about. The readers were not blaming this, but that the newspaper did not combine the central work with the actual actions and lives of the masses. The editorial department was vigilant about this and re-studied the improvement of newspaper work, and also studied the work inspection of the Liaoxi Daily Editorial Department and the article by Comrade Qian Danhui of the Wannan Daily. Ideologically, it became further clear that only by fully expressing the mass character of the newspaper can its guidance be well exerted.

Currently, the newspaper is making great efforts to reverse this bias. The editorial department groups carefully and patiently treat the submissions from farmers, try to adopt their works as much as possible, and care about the characters in the masses of farmers, their bits and pieces of creation and wisdom. It opposes the past practice of unilaterally pursuing the completeness of manuscripts and adopts a variety of forms to contact the masses. One of the forms that has been successfully tested so far is to hold "discussion meetings" in the newspaper (a current affairs discussion meeting has been held once, and a land reform discussion meeting is currently being held). This form can not only organize discussions and absorb more of the masses but also specifically understand the ideological situation of the masses and discover more practical problems. Some are very good news manuscripts.

In coordination with the entire editorial work, the newspaper has decided that in the future, most or all of the communication group's efforts will be used to cultivate and develop rural correspondents (in the past, the strength was used equally for cadres and rural correspondents). By contacting the masses through rural correspondents, the political quality of manuscripts will be improved, their writing enthusiasm will be encouraged, and more farmers will be absorbed to participate in newspaper work.

Rural current affairs propaganda has been strengthened since October of last year and now usually occupies one page or more. Forms such as "discussion meetings," "Q&A," "current affairs speeches," "current affairs clapper talk," "Three Character Classic," "small statistics," and "thematic serials" have been adopted, and the original blackboard newspaper has been improved. However, during this period, because the editorial department did not estimate that farmers still lacked many basic current affairs common sense, some aspects were still mostly hard-stuffed things from top to bottom, and it did not pay attention to the acceptance capacity of the masses, step by step. It impatiently asked the farmer to read the "second book" before he had finished reading the "first book." Now the newspaper has begun to pay attention to this, using "reading common sense," "small dictionaries," etc., to tell farmers these basic knowledge, and try to be simple and concise.

Second, popularization work. Dazhong Bao has put a lot of effort into this. Before changing to a popular newspaper targeting farmers, it studied Comrade Ke Lan's "How to Compile Popular Newspapers and Periodicals." Later, it slowly explored in its work and realized that the popularization of newspapers is a unified issue of content and form, that is, using the language of the masses to express the lives of the masses, rather than a simple translation of each word and sentence. True popularization must be "going deep and coming out shallow." Going deep means combining the understanding of specific problems with the grasp of the ideological situation of the masses; coming out shallow means starting from the existing knowledge level of the masses and using the forms that the masses like to hear and see, as well as their language, to express. That is, the experience of popularization in "new rural areas" is one of the main methods of contacting the masses in content and writing, from the specific to the abstract, from the facts to the principles, from the small to the large, from the near to the far, using the things of the masses to educate the masses. For example, many examples of the newspaper in contacting reality overly reported the activities of cadres and ignored the activities of the masses. Although the language was painstakingly worked on, it seemed very popular to read, but it was actually something that was divorced from the masses.

In the use of language, Dazhong Bao has the following points of experience:

1.  The use of dialects and spoken language cannot be one-sided and narrow. The language in Hunan is relatively complex, and it is difficult to find a representative dialect. After the newspaper was revised, there was a period when it used too much of the Changsha dialect, such as "no" using "mao de," "fortunately" using "dabang," "many" using "man duo," and "something happened" using "chule ge ke," and the masses did not understand it.
2.  Pay attention to the degree, and do not add branches and leaves at will. The work of popularization requires things to be visualized. In the expression, it is easy to be exaggerated and not appropriate. Due to the limitations of the manuscript, it is easy to "not have enough books, so immortals make up for it," or add some words "as a matter of course," which results in violations of the facts. For example, in one manuscript, the author wrote that a cadre committed bureaucracy, but did not write out his main performance, so the editorial department subjectively described it, saying that he "swayed back and forth and flaunted his power," but the actual situation was not like this. Sitting in the editorial office, you don't know at all.
3.  Pay attention to absorbing and refining the vocabulary of the masses and using it appropriately. Do not use old feudal or inappropriate proverbs or allegorical sayings to compare new things without selection. For example, in the past, we used to use "pao tou yu" (a type of fish) to describe active members in the farmers' association, and "weasel mixed into a chicken coop" to describe bad local elements mixed into the farmers' association. These metaphors were very inappropriate.
4.  In the structure of articles and grammar, we must strive for straightforward narration, and avoid flashbacks and inversions, as well as the accumulation of adverbs and adjectives. For example, writing "handed over three machine guns" is not as good as writing "handed over three machine guns." Simple sentences should be simple and clear, and long sentences can be organized into two small sentences. They should always be smooth to read and pleasing to hear.

In addition, the form should be diverse. In addition to making full use of the forms that are popular among the masses and are loved by the masses, such as "little tunes," "ballads," and "clapper talks," the patterns should be new, and there should be many methods, and they should be changed frequently. For example, in "criticism" and "praise," Dazhong Bao used "learn from good examples" and "don't learn from bad examples" in addition to the red and black lists; to reflect readers' opinions, in addition to "suggestions," "work opinions," and "farmers' letters," it also used "words of readers" and "intimate words." We must overcome rigidity and create more in our work.

In general, to do a good job in popularization, we must have a strong "reader concept" and always imagine that the reader is standing in front of us, what problems they have, how we should help them solve them, or what I want to tell them, and how should I tell them so that they feel kind and easy to understand.

Third, develop and cultivate rural correspondents. According to statistics at the end of December last year, there were 246 rural correspondents and farmer authors who regularly wrote for Dazhong Bao, with 463 submissions, accounting for only about 29 percent of the total number of submissions and people, and accounting for about 40 percent of the total number of submissions used. This shows that the foundation of rural correspondents' work is still very weak and has not been well done as a mass work and organizational work.

Now the editorial department has gradually realized that the development and cultivation of correspondents must first be considered politically. The editorial department should strengthen the political leadership of the correspondents and cultivate and promote their political enthusiasm in order to consolidate their writing enthusiasm. The newspaper has also discovered the "metabolism" phenomenon of correspondents and felt that "development is easy but consolidation is difficult." This is all due to neglecting political assistance to correspondents and simply providing them with technical guidance and requirements. As a result, farmers dare not let go of submitting manuscripts to the newspaper, feeling that what they write cannot be reported. The newspaper is now overcoming this problem. The quality of the manuscript is first political quality, not technical quality; the "care" for correspondents must also be political assistance, not simply the "care" of publishing one or two of their articles (naturally, rural correspondents who are new to writing often encounter difficulties in the question of "what to write and how to write," and must be patiently given specific guidance).

In the work of developing and cultivating rural correspondents, Dazhong Bao has explored two feasible methods: one is to combine the reading group and the communication group, and develop and cultivate correspondents in reading. Comrade Zhang Zhiliang, a correspondent of Dazhong Bao in Nanxian and a representative of the provincial farmers, has helped the newspaper develop four correspondents in the reading group he leads, all of whom have become active writers for the newspaper; one is to rely on rural correspondents to develop rural correspondents in their work. Comrade Li Yousheng, a correspondent of Dazhong Bao, is a newly promoted rural cadre. In the land reform work, he developed three correspondents, telling them about his writing situation and experience, talking very intimately and kindly, and breaking their concerns about writing. These all show that correspondents are the pillars of the newspaper, and we must rely on them to do a good job in the newspaper.

The contact with correspondents must be focused. The experience of Dazhong Bao is to achieve "seeing steadily, clipping accurately, and being willing to discard." The political, ideological situation, and writing ability of the correspondents must be thoroughly understood. In addition to general contact, attention must be paid to key contact and key cultivation. Do not give general replies in a businesslike manner. For key cultivated correspondents, you must have a good understanding of their requirements, and every month be able to write a few decent letters that can solve problems for them. Otherwise, it will inevitably become replying for the sake of replying, and be trapped in the circle of replying and rejecting manuscripts. The editorial department has put forward three requirements for reply work (which is one of the important ways to contact correspondents): first, have the enthusiasm to do mass work; second, have a negotiating attitude; third, use the tone of farmers. It is necessary to distinguish the objects, give specific guidance based on the shortcomings of the submissions, and combine the actual work and the situation of the correspondents to arrange tasks.

It is necessary to establish a communication group separately from the editorial department's groups to uniformly grasp the situation of the correspondents and contact them. The manuscripts of Dazhong Bao correspondents are handled by each group separately, and the communication group uniformly replies according to the opinions put forward by each group, avoiding the repetition and chaos when each group directly contacts. However, in doing so, we must also prevent two situations: one is that each group thinks that with a separate communication group, it relaxes the communication work because it is busy with editing work; the other is that the communication group takes the opinions of each group and replies to the manuscript without considering it comprehensively. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the task of the entire editorial department to do a good job in communication work, and overcome the business-like and bureaucratic style towards correspondents.

III.

The above are some of the experiences of Dazhong Bao in five months of editorial work. In addition, the newspaper has done very little in the work of commentary, criticism and self-criticism, readers' letters, and question-and-answer offices. The newspaper often does not dare to freely publish the correct criticisms made by the masses of farmers, so the voice of the newspaper is small and its power is not strong. The masses of farmers welcome Dazhong Bao, but Dazhong Bao has not been able to truly establish a flesh-and-blood connection with the masses of farmers. Cadres are also slowly growing, but they have not been able to take root in the vast rural areas, so they still show a certain degree of floating. What is particularly important is that the ideology of Comrade Stalin's teaching of "farmers' newspapers" to "promote the worker-peasant alliance and promote the leadership of workers over peasants" is still very unclear. How to implement this promotion needs to be further studied in actual work. In the future, in internal work, we are prepared to gradually achieve politicization and scientification, strengthen the leadership of the editorial committee, strengthen the role of the general editor's office, and make the work of each group better. At the same time, cadres will be transferred to the countryside in batches to exercise in actual movements, in order to further improve the work.

　　通俗报纸长沙大众报经验介绍
    编者按：通俗报纸长沙大众报的经验很好。通俗化是目前报纸和出版工作中最重要的问题之一。由于不通俗，目前大部分报纸和出版物都停留在一部分人手中，没有真正深入到工人和农民群众中去，成为他们日常工作和生活中的顾问和助手。而另一方面，工人和农民群众严重地缺乏适合他们需要的读物。这是报纸和出版工作中的一种严重的、不能容忍的现象。这种现象必须坚决加以改变。“书报评论”将继续讨论这个问题，希望各地编辑工作者、作者、发行者和读者都来发表意见，并提供关于这一方面的实际情况。
　  一
    长沙大众报的前身是由解放前湖南的两家较进步的晚报——实践报和晚晚报合并组织起来的，原名大众晚报，以城市工人、学生为主要对象，并照顾工商界，对城市各种运动的配合和报纸通俗化的工作，曾有一定的成绩。但在私营期间，报社情况是困难的：对象不够明确，发行份数少（仅一千五百份左右），每月亏累很大。政府虽曾在各方面给这张私营报纸以支持，但终以销路打不开，经常处在困难之中。去年六月间，湖南举行第一次全省农民代表会议，报社主动向大会提议，愿将报纸献给全省农民，配合湖南土地改革运动，为湖南农村社会改革和建设事业服务。大会接受了这个提议，遂在去年八月间，在原有基础上改为以全省农民为对象的通俗报纸。
    经过这个改变，带来了报纸的迅速而有生气的发展。到今年一月份已发行到三万八千多份，每月可收到稿件一千五百篇到两千篇左右，替报纸经常写稿的农村通讯员、区乡干部、积极作者在八百人左右。由于宣传了党在农村中的政策，初步联系了农村群众，配合了土地改革和生产运动以及农村时事教育，文字通俗浅显，适合农民文化程度，受到农民群众的热烈欢迎。现在订报最多的乡，已达两百多份，每个农民协会小组有三份到五份。
    大众报与新湖南报在一起办公，印刷、经理、发行（交邮局）都由新湖南报统一管理，所以它的组织很简单：只有一个编辑部，工作人员共二十二人。编辑部总的领导，上有编委会，下有总编室，分农民运动、农业生产（包括城乡经济）、农民生活、时事资料及通联等五个组。工作方法是“编通合一”，由编委会制订总的编辑方针和报道计划，交总编室和各组执行。
    大众报五个月来的经验证明，在省级主要报纸直接领导下，出版一张通俗的农民报纸，是有可能和有必要的。省级主要报纸由于某些条件限制，常不能满足与适合农民的具体需要。在农民报纸和省级主要报纸分立的状态下，在报道上又常容易重复和混乱。而在省级主要报纸直接领导下来办这种报纸，分工问题即可很好解决，比如：在目前土地改革运动中，新湖南报掌握总的思想与政策的领导；大众报即集中对农民进行教育和鼓动。这样做，不仅不会妨碍省级主要报纸的群众性，而且可以帮助省级主要报纸联系群众；不仅不会减少省级主要报纸的发行，而且可以进一步增加发行。
    大众报由于和新湖南报在一起，节省了不少管理费用，也更容易达到自给。
  二
    大众报过去五个月的工作中，由于工作人员对农村情况不熟悉，绝大部分缺少实际运动的知识和经验，群众观点不强，政策水平低，因此还存在着很多缺点，但是它在以下三个方面的经验是值得介绍的：
    第一，怎样把指导性和群众性结合起来。在这个问题上，曾经走过一些弯路。报纸初改版时，编辑部体会到这张报纸是给农民看的，一定要让报纸充满农民群众的声音和作品。但当时农民替报纸写稿的还不多，报纸尽量采用了他们的稿子，反映他们的生活。不久发现这种反映，和运动结合不紧，不能抓住农民生活、思想、感情的重要方面，指导性很弱。以后便注意了加强报纸的指导性。这一时期，对秋收以后的选种、留种、积肥、秋冬耕，以及土地改革运动的发动群众，宣传政策等，一般说是结合得比较紧了。但是，又走了另一极端，用过多的篇幅报道了干部活动，放松了群众活动。比如：宣传谁种谁收政策的时候，报纸有不少消息，老是先报道干部怎样开会，后来群众对政策摸到底了，就种了多少萝卜、油菜、草子。不是用一堆数目字来代替群众的实际活动；就是一些笼统的概念，缺少具体的单个的实例，也就同样看不到群众活动。又如在报道土地改革发动群众的时候，也是干部如何下乡、如何开会、讲了些什么话，这样群众懂得了，搞通了等等，而很少把政策融化到群众的觉悟程度和实际行动中去。表现在版面上的就是沉闷，缺乏生气，这时，读者提出意见了：“报纸上光是谈土地改革，谈生产，说小故事，没得味。”编辑部仔细地研究了读者的意见，发现土地改革要谈，生产要谈，读者责备的并不是这个，而是报纸没有把中心工作和群众的实际行动和生活结合起来。编辑部警惕了这一点，重新进行了关于改进报纸工作的学习，又研读了辽西日报编辑部的工作检查，和皖南日报钱丹辉同志的文章，在思想上进一步明确起来，了解到只有充分表现报纸的群众性，才能很好地发挥他的指导性。
    目前报纸已在大力扭转这一偏向。编辑部分组审慎地耐心地对待农民的来稿，尽量采用他们的作品，关心农民群众中的人物，他们一点一滴的创造和智慧。反对过去片面追求稿件完整的作法，并采取多种多样的形式去联系群众。目前已经试验成功的形式之一，是在报纸上举行“讨论会”（已举行过一次时事讨论会，现正举行土地改革讨论会），这种形式，不但可以组织讨论，吸收更多数的群众；还可以具体了解群众的思想情况，发现更多的实际问题。有些就是很好的新闻稿件。
    和整个编辑工作相配合，报纸已决定今后将通联组的大部或全部力量，用在培养和发展农村通讯员上（过去是对干部和农村通讯员平均使用力量），通过农村通讯员联系群众，提高稿件的政治质量，鼓励他们的写作热情，吸收更多的农民群众参加报纸工作。
    农村时事宣传从去年十月份起开始加强，现在通常占到一版或一版以上的地位，采用了“讨论会”、“问题解答”、“时事讲话”、“时事快板”、“三字经”、“小统计”和“专题连载”等形式，并且把原有的黑板报加以改进。但是这一时期，由于编辑部没有估计到农民还缺乏许多基本的时事常识，某些方面还是由上往下硬灌的东西居多，没有很好地注意群众的接受能力，一步一步的来，就性急地在农民没有读完“第一册”之前，要他读“第二册”。现在报纸已开始在这方面加以注意，以“读报常识”，“小辞典”等，告诉农民这些基本知识，并且尽量注意浅显、扼要。
    第二，通俗化工作。大众报在这方面费的力量很大。改以农民为对象的通俗报纸以前，就学习了柯蓝同志的“怎样编写通俗报刊”。后来又在工作中慢慢摸索，才体会到报纸的通俗化，是一个内容和形式相统一的问题，也就是用群众的语言，表现群众的生活，而不是一字一句的简单的翻译。真正的通俗，必须是“深入浅出”的。深入，即是把对具体问题的了解与对群众思想情况的掌握相结合；浅出，即是从群众的现有知识水平出发，用群众喜闻乐见的形式以及他们的语言来表现。也就是“新农村”通俗化经验中的由具体到抽象，由事实到原则，由小到大，由近到远，用群众的东西来教育群众，是内容和文字上联系群众的主要方法之一。比如，报纸在联系实际方面的很多例子，过多地报道了干部的活动，忽略了群众的活动，虽然在文字上苦心苦意下了功夫，读起来好象很通俗，但实际上还是脱离群众的东西。
    在文字的运用上，大众报有这样几点体会：
    一、方言和口语的运用，不能片面、狭隘。湖南的语言比较复杂，很难找到一种代表性的方言，在报纸改版后，曾经有一个时期，过多地采用了长沙的方言，如“没有”用“冒得”，“幸亏”用“搭帮”，“很多”用“蛮多”，“出了事”用“出了咯壳”等，结果群众反而不懂。
    二、要注意分寸，不能随便添枝加叶。通俗化的工作，要求事物形象化，在表现的时候，往往容易浮夸，而不能恰如其分，由于稿件的限制，便容易“书不够，神仙凑”，或者“想当然”地添一些话进去，结果有违事实。比如，在有一篇稿子中，作者写一个干部犯官僚主义，但没有写出他的主要表现，于是编辑部就主观地加以形容，说他“摆来摆去，抖威风”，而实际情形不是如此，坐在编辑室里就根本不晓得。
    三、对群众语汇要注意吸收提炼，并使用得适当，不能用旧的封建性的或不适当的谚语，歇后语，不加选择地来比拟新的事物。如过去我们曾经用“泡头鱼”来形容农会中的积极分子，用“黄鼠狼混进鸡窝”，来形容地方坏分子混入农会，这些比喻都很不恰当。
    四、在文章结构和语法结构上，必须力求平铺直叙，切忌倒叙和倒装，以及副词，形容词的堆砌。如写“缴到机枪三挺”，就不如写“缴到三挺机枪”。单句要简单明快，长句可组织成两小句，总要念来顺口，听来顺耳。
    此外，形式要多样，除尽量利用群众中流行的和为群众所喜爱的形式，如“小调”、“歌谣”、“快板”等外，还要花样新，办法多，时常变换。比如“批评”“表扬”，大众报除红黑榜外，还采用了“学好样”“莫学坏样”；反映读者意见除“建议”“工作意见”“农民来信”等，还用了“读报人的话”、“知心语”等。必须克服呆板，在工作中多创造。
    总的说来，做好通俗化工作，一定要具有强烈的“读者观念”，时时设想读者就站在我们的面前，他存在了什么问题，我们要怎样帮助他解决，或者我要告诉他什么，应该怎样告诉法，才能使他感到亲切、易懂。
    第三、发展和培养农村通讯员。到去年十二月底的统计，替大众报经常写稿的农村通讯员和农民作者共二百四十六人，来稿四百六十三篇，仅占总来稿篇数及人数的百分之二十九，占总用稿的百分之四十左右，这说明农村通讯员工作的基础还很薄弱，没有很好地当做一个群众工作和组织工作来做。
    现在编辑部已逐渐领会到对通讯员的发展和培养，首先必须从政治上考虑。编辑部应该加强对通讯员的政治领导，培养和发扬他们的政治热情，才能巩固他们的写作热情。报纸也曾发现通讯员的“新陈代谢”现象，并且感到“发展容易巩固难”，都由于忽视了对通讯员政治上的帮助，单纯地对他们作技术上的指导和要求。结果使农民不敢放手向报纸投稿，觉得他们写的东西不能上报。现在报纸正在克服这个毛病，稿件的质量首先是政治质量，不是技术质量；对通讯员的“照顾”也必须是政治上的帮助，而不是单纯地登他一两篇东西的“照顾”（自然农村通讯员初学写稿，对“写什么、怎样写”的问题常常碰到困难，必须同样耐心地给他具体指导）。
    在发展和培养农村通讯员的工作中，大众报已经摸索到两种可行的办法：一种是把读报组和通讯组结合，在读报当中发展和培养通讯员。大众报南县通讯员、省农民代表张志良同志，在他所领导的读报组中，曾经帮助报纸发展了四个通讯员，都成了报纸的积极的写稿者；一种是依靠农村通讯员在工作中发展农村通讯员。大众报通讯员李佑生同志，是新提拔的农村干部，他在土地改革工作中就发展了三个通讯员，他把自己写稿的情形和经验告诉了他们，谈得很知心、亲切，打破了他们对写稿的顾虑。这些都说明通讯员是报纸的柱石，必须依靠他们，才能把报纸工作做好。
    对通讯员的联系，必须是有重点。大众报的经验是要做到“看得稳、夹得准、舍得丢”，对通讯员的政治、思想情况和写作能力必须摸到底，在一般联系以外，必须要注意重点联系，重点培养，不能事务性地一般回信，对重点培养的通讯员，必须很好地了解他的要求，每月能象样的写几封能解决问题的信给他，否则，必定变成为回信而回信，陷在回信退稿的圈子里而摆布不开。对回信工作（这是联系通讯员的重要方式之一），编辑部曾提出三个要求：一、有做群众工作的热情；二、有打商量的态度；三、用农民口气。要分清对象，根据来稿的缺点具体地给以指导，再结合实际工作和通讯员的情况布置任务。
    在编辑部各组以外，单独成立一个通联组，统一掌握通讯员的情况和对通讯员的联系是必要的。大众报通讯员稿件分别由各组处理，通联组根据各组所提出的意见统一复信，避免了各组直接联系时的重复、凌乱现象。但这样做，也要防止两种情况，一种是各组认为有了单独的通联组，因忙于编辑工作，而放松了通联工作；一种是通联组拿到各组的意见，即就稿回信，不从全面考虑。所以必须明确全编辑部共同做好通讯工作的任务，并且克服对通讯员事务主义和官僚主义的作风。
  三
    上面是大众报在五个月编辑工作中的几点体会。此外，报纸对评论，批评和自我批评、读者来信和问事处等工作，还作得很少。报纸对于农民群众所提出的正确的批评，常常不敢放手发表，因此报纸的声音小，力量不强。农民群众欢迎大众报，但大众报还没有能真正建立和农民群众的血肉的联系。干部也在慢慢生长，但还没有能生根于广大农村之中，所以还表现了一定程度的飘浮。特别重要的，是对于斯大林同志教导“农民报”的“要鼓吹工农联盟，鼓吹工人对农民的领导”，思想上还很不明确。如何贯彻这一鼓吹，还需在实际工作中继续研究。今后，在内部工作上，准备逐步做到政治化，科学化，加强编委会的领导，加强总编室的作用，使各组的工作做得更好。同时分批抽调干部下乡，在实际运动中锻炼，以期进一步改进工作。
