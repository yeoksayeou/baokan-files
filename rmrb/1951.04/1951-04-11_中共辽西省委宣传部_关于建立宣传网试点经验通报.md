　　Circular on Pilot Experience in Establishing a Propaganda Network
Editor's Note: The problems discovered by the CCP Liaoxi Provincial Committee regarding the establishment of a Party propaganda network may exist to varying degrees in other regions and warrant attention. Some of the opinions put forward in this circular are correct. It is very important to combine this with current work and propaganda campaigns to establish a Party propaganda network. Currently, various regions are launching enthusiastic anti-American and aid-Korea current affairs propaganda, preparing to hold signatures in support of concluding a peace pact and voting against the armed rearmament of Japan, and preparing for the "May 1st" grand demonstration. Therefore, wherever there is a Party foundation, special efforts should be made to seize the opportunity of the high tide of the movement before "May 1st" to initially establish the propaganda network during the movement and continue to develop and consolidate it after "May 1st."

    Recently, we received materials from ten counties and cities, including Xingcheng, Zhangwu, Tieling, Kaiyuan, Shanhaiguan, Beizhen, Shuangliao, Liaozhong, Changtu, and Changbei, on pilot programs for establishing propaganda networks and running training courses for branch propaganda committee members and propagandists. We learned that various regions have begun to explore the work of establishing propaganda networks during this period and have gained preliminary experience. However, since the creation of these experiences was mainly based on the spirit of the joint conference of city and county propaganda ministers before receiving the central government's decision, some issues are not very clear. Therefore, based on the materials reflected by various regions and the Liaoxi Provincial Committee Propaganda Department's experience in establishing a propaganda network pilot program in Xinmin County, we feel that there are still many problems in carrying out this work that are worth further study. The following issues are raised as a reference for various regions to summarize their pilot experiences:

    (1) How to Implement the Central Government's Decision: First of all, it is necessary to organize the entire Party to study this important document well, which is a crucial part of establishing the propaganda network. It must be fully recognized that the establishment of a propaganda network is not only an organizational form issue but also an extremely important step to fundamentally improve the Party's method of leading the masses, correct certain coercive and simplistic working styles, and strengthen the Party's connection with the masses. Therefore, the central government's decision must be given sufficient attention, and organized study must be carried out seriously, especially by the Party committees' propaganda departments, which should first carefully study and propose preliminary implementation opinions for the central government's decision to provide a reference for the Party committee to study the implementation plan. The Xinmin County Committee studied the central government's decision and the People's Daily and Northeast Daily editorials on establishing a propaganda network and formulated a specific plan for implementing the central government's decision based on the county's situation. The Shanhaiguan Municipal Committee and the Changtu County Committee also organized document study and formulated plans, which are all very good. How other cities and counties are organizing study has not been reflected yet. We hope to organize study immediately and formulate specific plans based on the Northeast Bureau's decision to implement the central government's decision and the spirit of the Provincial Committee's instructions and implementation plan on establishing a propaganda network, to further summarize the pilot experiences.

    (2) Establishing Propagandists in Branches: Some counties are not clear enough on this point. Some do not propose establishing propagandists in the branches but only mention: "Establishing village propaganda groups," neglecting the conditions of the branches and the Party's foundation. Even more, they neglect that the established propagandists are Party propagandists and do not pay attention to the direct leadership of the Party committee and Party branch, not taking Party and Youth League members as the main force, but reducing the Party's propagandists to the level of ordinary people. For example, in the booklet "How to Develop Reading Groups and Establish Propagandists" printed by Shuangliao, the establishment of propagandists is explained as: "It has the broadest mass character because propagandists all come from the masses. Wherever there are masses, propagandists can be developed and propaganda networks can be organized." This is very inappropriate. The central government proposed: "Establish propagandists in every Party branch." Therefore, the establishment of a propaganda network cannot be separated from branch Party members. In places where branches have not been established or where the branch foundation is weak, appropriate forms should be adopted to absorb non-Party cadres and activists among the masses to participate in the work of the propaganda network. In addition, Shuangliao determined 50 propagandist targets in the training class for propaganda activists run by the county party committee office and had them "directly contacted and trained by the county party committee and approved by the district party committee," and then handed over to the branch leadership. This leadership of propagandists will be disconnected and should be corrected. Propagandists should generally be established and regularly led by the branch from the beginning. Propagandists trained at the county level should also be handed over to the branch leadership, and the district party committee should strengthen its assistance to the branch. In addition, propagandists must be based on the central government's regulations, with Party and Youth League members as the main force and as the backbone, absorbing qualified non-Party activists. Some mistakenly believe that "Party members are natural propagandists, and it is enough to determine a few to participate, mainly developing the masses." This will reduce the quality of the Party's propaganda network and prevent it from playing its due role.

    (3) Combining Current Work and Propaganda Campaigns to Establish Propagandists: Beizhen launched a larger propaganda activity in the entire village during the pilot program of establishing propagandists, publicizing opposition to the United States arming Japan and mobilizing the masses to accuse the Japanese invaders of their atrocities. On the one hand, it educated the masses and deepened their hatred of American imperialism. On the other hand, it further tested the propagandists through propaganda activities. Zhangwu also mentioned combining current work to establish propagandists in its summary of the pilot experience and analyzed the ideological reflections of the masses on the current situation and issues such as burdens and production, and immediately arranged practical propaganda content. Other counties rarely mentioned combining current work. For example, Tieling only combined it with reorganizing amateur theatrical troupes and failed to combine it well with the issues that the masses are most concerned about, such as the current anti-American and aid-Korea campaign, sideline production, preparing for spring plowing, and burdens. Existing experience has proven that establishing a propaganda network in isolation from work and campaigns will not promote current work on the one hand, and propagandists will feel that there is no content to promote on the other hand. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent the isolated establishment of a propaganda network to avoid becoming a mere formality.

    (4) Selection of Propagandists and Leadership of Propagandists: In the methods of establishing propagandists, three inappropriate methods were discovered. Tieling selected Party and Youth League members, labor models, village cadres, village representatives, and activists from the original propaganda team, based on the conditions of propagandists, and determined them as propagandist training targets after branch discussions. Then they were tested in propaganda campaigns and determined as propagandists through organizational procedures. This development only achieved prudence, but as a pilot program, it could not obtain complete experience and was a bit slow. Because there were already Party and Youth League members and propaganda activists who had been tested in propaganda campaigns, they should have been determined as propagandists after observation in the pilot program. Secondly, Xingcheng adopted the method of opening up thinking among the masses and encouraging self-reporting in the pilot program of establishing propagandists in Yang'anpu Village. Twenty-four people reported at one time and were all determined to be propagandists. Changbei County also used the "self-reporting and public discussion" method, and Shuangliao County stipulated that "propagandists should be developed through democratic elections." These two methods are also inappropriate. The central government stipulates that "the appointment of propagandists should be reviewed and approved by the Party branch committee and higher-level Party organizations," and must be implemented in accordance with the central government's regulations. Because some people who are self-reported or elected by the masses may not meet the standards stipulated for propagandists. If higher-level Party organizations do not approve, it will affect their emotions. Establishing propagandists in accordance with the procedures stipulated by the central government should also continue to unite mass activists to participate in propaganda activities and continuously cultivate and improve them, rather than abandoning them. Elementary school students cannot be the target of propagandist members because they are divorced from production and cannot be familiar with policies, and they are too young to have any prestige among the masses. It is inappropriate that there are ten elementary school students among the 24 propagandists in Yang'anpu Village, Xingcheng. We are not denying the role of students in propaganda activities. In future large propaganda campaigns, we will still need to use this force appropriately, but elementary school students cannot be Party propagandists (they can be used under the name of newspaper readers, etc.). In addition, when starting to establish propagandists, it is not only necessary to open up the thinking of leaders at all levels of Party committees, but also to break the concerns of Party members, Youth League members, and the masses about serving as propagandists. For example, several counties have found that Party members, Youth League members, and mass activists have the following concerns about becoming propagandists: (1) fear of delaying production, (2) fear of being the first to take the lead in everything and suffering losses (of course, those who are unwilling to lead by example do not meet the conditions for propagandists), (3) fear of being laughed at for being crude and unable to speak, etc. Therefore, it must first be made clear that it is a glorious duty for Party members to serve as propagandists, and the same should be told to non-Party members, that the task is glorious and that the work is beneficial to their own learning. Moreover, the activities of propagandists are to carry out propaganda to the people around them, not to speak everywhere, to break these concerns. In addition, on the issue of leadership of propagandists, Tieling proposed that in order to closely integrate the activities of propagandists with current work, it is suggested that people's congresses absorb propagandists to attend as observers. This method is of course possible, but it does not need to be stipulated as a system to prevent the Party branch from relaxing its leadership over them because the propagandists participated in the meeting, or the tendency to use propagandists as cadres.

### 中共辽西省委宣传部　关于建立宣传网试点经验通报

　　中共辽西省委宣传部
　　关于建立宣传网试点经验通报
    编者按：中共辽西省委所发现的关于建立党的宣传网中的问题，其他地方也可能或多或少地存在，值得各地注意。这个通报中提出的一些意见是正确的。其中说到应该结合当前工作，结合宣传运动，来建立党的宣传网，是很重要的。现在各地正在展开热烈的抗美援朝时事宣传，酝酿举行拥护缔结和平公约签名和反对武装日本的投票，准备“五一”大示威，因此凡有党的基础的地方，都应特别抓紧“五一”以前的运动高涨时机，在运动中把宣传网初步建立起来，并在“五一”后继续加以发展和巩固。
    最近收到兴城、彰武、铁岭、开原、山海关、北镇、双辽、辽中、昌图、昌北等十县市建立宣传网试点及开办支部宣传委员及宣传员训练班材料，了解到各地在这一时期，都先后着手摸索建立宣传网工作，并取得了初步经验。但由于这些经验的创造，主要是根据在未接到中央决定之前的市、县宣传部长联席会议精神布置的，对有些问题尚不十分明确，所以从各地反映材料及省委宣传部在新民县建立宣传网试点的体验，感到目前在进行这一工作中，还存在很多问题，值得进一步研究，现提出以下几个问题作为各地总结试点经验的参考：
    （一）如何贯彻中央决定问题：首先必须很好的组织全党学习这一重要文件，这是建立宣传网工作的决定一环。必须充分认识到建立宣传网，不仅是个组织形式问题，而是从根本上改进党对群众的领导方法，纠正某些强迫命令作风、简单化工作方式，加强党与群众联系的一个极其重要的步骤，因此对中央决定必须引起足够的重视，认真组织学习，特别是党委宣传部门，更要首先细致研究，并初步提出贯彻中央决定的实施意见，提供党委研究实施计划的参考。新民县委会学习了中央决定及人民日报、东北日报关于建立宣传网的社论，并根据本县情况，定出实施中央决定的具体计划。山海关市委、昌图县委也曾组织学习文件，订出计划，这都是很好的；其他市、县如何组织学习，还没有反映，希即组织学习，并根据东北局实施中央决定的决定及省委关于建立宣传网的指示和实施计划精神，定出具体计划，进一步总结试点经验。
    （二）在支部建立宣传员问题：这一点上有些县还不够明确。有的不是提出在支部建立宣传员，而是只提：“建立村宣传小组”，忽视支部条件和党的基础；更有的忽视了建立的宣传员是党的宣传员，不注意党委与党支部的直接领导，不是以党、团员为主，而把党的宣传员降低到一般群众的水平，如双辽印发的《如何开展读报组建立宣传员》小册子上，把建立宣传员解释成：“它有最广泛的群众性，因为宣传员都是从群众中来的，只要有群众的地方，都可以发展宣传员和组织宣传网”，这样提法是很不妥当的。中央提出：“在党的每个支部设立宣传员”，因此建立宣传网不能脱离支部党员，在没有建立支部和支部基础弱的地方，应采取适当形式，吸收非党的干部和群众中的积极分子，参加宣传网的工作。另外双辽在县委办的宣传积极分子训练班内，确定五十名宣传员对象，并且由“县委直接联系培养，区委批准”，然后再交给支部领导，这样对宣传员的领导，会发生脱节现象，应该纠正过来。宣传员一般应该是一开始就由支部建立并经常领导，县里训练的宣传员也应交支部领导，而加强区委对支部的帮助。另外宣传员必须是按中央规定条件，以党、团员为主，以党、团员做骨干，吸收够条件的非党积极分子；有的误以为“党员是当然的宣传员，确定几个参加进去就行了，主要是发展群众”，这样就会使党的宣传网降低质量，发挥不了应有的作用。
    （三）结合当前工作，结合宣传运动建立宣传员：北镇在建立宣传员试点当中，曾展开了全村较大的宣传活动，宣传反对美国武装日本，发动群众控诉日寇的暴行，一方面教育了群众，加深对美帝国主义的仇恨，一方面从宣传活动当中进一步考验了宣传员。彰武总结试点经验当中，也曾提到结合当前工作建立宣传员，并且分析了群众对当前形势及负担、生产等问题上的思想反映，当即布置了切合实际的宣传内容。其他县很少提到结合当前工作，如铁岭只结合整理了业余剧团，对当前的抗美援朝、副业生产、准备春耕、负担等群众最关心的问题，没能很好结合。已有经验证明：脱离工作、脱离运动孤立地建立宣传网，一方面不能推动当前工作，一方面宣传员也会感到没内容可宣传，因此必须防止孤立地建立宣传网，以免流于形式。
    （四）宣传员的选拔和对宣传员的领导问题：在建立宣传员的方式上，发现三种不大妥当的办法。铁岭是在原有宣传队伍中，选择党、团员，劳动模范，村干部，村代表，积极分子，按宣传员条件，经支部讨论，确定为宣传员培养对象，然后在宣传运动中考验，再经过组织手续确定为宣传员，这样发展只作到了慎重，但作为一个试点说，不能取得完整经验，未免慢了些，因为已经有了经过宣传运动考验过的党、团员及宣传积极分子，在试点中又经过考察，就应该确定为宣传员了。其次兴城在羊安堡村建立宣传员试点，是采取了在群众中打通思想，启发自报方式，一次报了二十四名，都确定成了宣传员，昌北县也是“自报公议”方式，双辽县，是规定“通过民主选举方式发展宣传员”，这两种方式也都不妥当。中央规定“宣传员的任命应当经过党的支部委员会审查通过和高一级党组织的批准”，必须按中央规定执行。因为群众自报或选举的人，会有一些不合宣传员规定标准，如上级党组织批不准，反会影响这些人的情绪；而按中央规定手续建立宣传员，同时仍应在宣传活动中继续团结群众积极分子参加宣传，并不断培养提高他们，而不是把他们抛开。宣传员的成员不能以小学生为对象，因为他们脱离生产，不可能熟悉政策，年纪小，也不会在群众中有什么威信。兴城羊安堡村二十四名宣传员中有十名小学生，是不妥当的。我们并不是否定学生在宣传活动上的作用，今后在大的宣传运动上也还要适当运用这批力量，但小学生不能作为党的宣传员（可用读报员等名义）。另外开始建立宣传员的时候，不但要打通各级党委领导上的思想，而且要打破党、团员群众对充当宣传员的顾虑，如目前几个县曾发现党、团员和群众积极分子对当宣传员存在的顾虑有：（一）怕耽误生产，（二）怕事事带头吃亏（当然不愿以身作则的就不够宣传员条件），（三）怕大老粗不会讲话叫人笑话等等，因此必须首先交待清党员充当宣传员是光荣义务，对非党员也应同样讲清任务光荣，对工作对自己的学习都有好处，而且宣传员的活动是对自己周围的人民群众进行宣传，不是到处去讲话，以打破这些顾虑。此外对宣传员领导问题，铁岭提出为了使宣传员活动密切结合当前工作，建议人民代表会吸收宣传员旁听，这方式当然可以，但不必规定为制度，防止因宣传员参加了会议就放松支部对他们的领导，或者拿宣传员当干部使用的偏向。
