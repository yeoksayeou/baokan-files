　　On the Question of Not Including Enemy Characters in Yangge Teams
    To the Editor:
    After reading Gu Zhongkai's opinion in the Reader's Letters column of "People's Literature and Art," Issue 88, entitled "Yangge Teams Should Not Include Enemy Characters," I feel that this statement is rather general. If it is said that reactionary characters should not sing and dance together with the laboring people's characters in a Yangge team, then that is correct. Gu Zhongkai raised this issue in reference to the Yangge team of the Beijing China Construction Enterprise Company's Technical Training Class. As far as I know, similar situations exist in some places in Qinghai. However, we cannot simply oppose the presence of enemy characters in Yangge teams in a general way based on form alone; we should first analyze the content. In the Yangge teams performing in Xining this Spring Festival, the majority had enemy characters, such as Truman, Chiang Kai-shek, Ma Bufang, and other reactionary characters. When these reactionary characters appeared in the Yangge team, they were escorted by armed people before, behind, or to the sides, using a posture of escorting war criminals to participate. This indicates that the people are victorious, and the enemy will be punished under the powerful strength of the people. Doesn't this express the wishes of the laboring people? Why shouldn't such enemy characters appear in the Yangge team?
    I believe that whether or not there should be enemy characters in a Yangge team should be decided by how the enemy characters are portrayed. We cannot oppose it in a general way without distinguishing the content.
           Qinghai Xining Wang Daming

    Editor's Note: After "People's Literature and Art" published Gu Zhongkai's opinion, "Yangge Teams Should Not Include Enemy Characters," in Issue 88 (February 18th), we have recently received submissions from comrades Niu Yongshu, Qi Bali, Wang Keshan, and Long Wen from Qinghai, expressing their opinions on whether or not there should be enemy characters in Yangge teams. Here, we publish Comrade Wang Daming's letter. We believe that Yangge dance is generally suitable for expressing the collective emotions of the masses, especially joyful emotions. In Yangge dramas, more complex life situations can be expressed, and all classes and all characters can be portrayed, including enemy characters. However, when enemy characters are played in Yangge dances or Yangge teams, when they twist and dance together and parade through the streets, it is actually difficult to achieve the effect of hatred, contempt, and disdain for the enemy. On the contrary, it is very easy for the audience to have the impression of not distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves or of enjoying themselves with the enemy. Therefore, we still agree with the opinions of Comrade Gu Zhongkai and others that it is generally not appropriate to play enemy characters in Yangge dance teams, and especially not appropriate to twist and dance together with such ugly images.

### 关于秧歌队中不应有敌人角色的问题

专栏：读者来信

　　关于秧歌队中不应有敌人角色的问题编辑同志：
    读了《人民文艺》第八十八期读者来信栏内谷中凯的《秧歌队中不应有敌人角色》的意见后，我觉得这种说法比较笼统。如果说秧歌队里不应使反动角色与劳动人民的角色同歌同舞，这是对的。谷中凯提出这个问题，是指摘北京中国建筑企业公司技工训练班秧歌队的，就我所知，青海有些地方也有类似情形；但我们不能仅从形式上笼统地反对秧歌队中有敌人角色，应该首先从内容上去分析。西宁在今年春节演出的秧歌队中，大多数是有敌人角色的，如杜鲁门、蒋介石、马步芳等反动角色在秧歌队中出现时，前后或左右都有人民的武装押解着，用一种押送战犯的姿态来参加。这表示人民是胜利的，敌人在人民强大的力量下，将要受到制裁。这不正表现了劳动人民的愿望吗？像这样出现在秧歌队中的敌人角色，为什么不应有呢？
    我认为秧歌队中是否应有敌人角色，要看敌人角色在秧歌队中是怎样扮演来决定，不能笼统地，不分别内容地加以反对。
            青海西宁  汪大明          
    编者按：《人民文艺》第八十八期（二月十八日）发表了谷中凯的《秧歌队中不应有敌人角色》的意见后，最近连续接到北京市读者牛永淑、戚巴里、王克善及青海读者龙文等同志来稿，对秧歌队中应否有敌人角色发表意见。这里，我们发表了汪大明同志的来信。我们认为秧歌舞一般适宜于表现群众集体的情绪，特别是欢乐的情绪。在秧歌剧中，可以表现较复杂的生活情节，可以表现一切阶级，一切人物，包括敌人的角色在内。而在秧歌舞或秧歌队中扮演敌人角色，当其共同扭跳，招摇过市的时候，事实上很难收到对敌人的仇视、蔑视与鄙视的效果，反而极容易使观众产生敌我不分或与敌同乐的印象。因此我们仍然同意谷中凯等同志的意见，在秧歌舞队中一般地不宜扮演敌人的角色，特别不宜和那样丑恶的形象一同扭跳。
