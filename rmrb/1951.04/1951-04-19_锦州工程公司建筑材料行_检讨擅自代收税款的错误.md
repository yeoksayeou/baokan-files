　　Jinzhou Engineering Company Building Materials Store
　　Self-Criticism of Unauthorized Tax Collection

To the Editor:

    We sincerely accept the criticism published in the "Reader's Letters" section of your newspaper on January 4th regarding "Jinzhou Engineering Company Building Materials Store Should Not Abuse its Authority and Collect Taxes Without Authorization," and offer the following self-criticism:

    Since our store was established in July 1950, we have been contracting electrical engineering equipment and materials. At the time, we only knew that a 3% tax should be paid on the sale of goods, but we did not contact the Jinzhou Tax Bureau regarding how to pay it. We collected the tax without authorization and temporarily recorded it in our store's tax account. It was not until the Jinzhou Tax Bureau audited our accounts that the error was discovered. This demonstrates our lack of attention to national tax laws. It also shows that we were ideologically numb and lacked political study in our work. In addition to admitting our mistake to the Jinzhou Tax Bureau, we guarantee to intensify our work and study in the future to improve our political level.

          Manager, Jinzhou Engineering Company Building Materials Store, Cui En

### 锦州工程公司建筑材料行　检讨擅自代收税款的错误

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　  锦州工程公司建筑材料行
  　检讨擅自代收税款的错误编辑同志：
    一月四日贵报《读者来信》刊载对“锦州工程公司建筑材料行不该滥用职权擅自收税”的批评，我们诚恳接受，并作如下检讨：
    我行自一九五○年七月成立后，开始承揽电气工程器材。当时我们只知道售出货物应纳百分之三的税款，至于应如何缴纳，我们未与锦州市税务局连系即擅自代收，并将该项税款暂记我行税金科目帐上。直到锦州市税务局查帐，始发觉错误。这是我们对国家税法未予重视的表现。也说明了我们在工作中思想麻痹，政治学习不够。除向锦州市税务局承认错误外，我们保证今后加紧工作和学习，以提高我们的政治水平。
          锦州工程公司建筑材料行经理  崔恩
