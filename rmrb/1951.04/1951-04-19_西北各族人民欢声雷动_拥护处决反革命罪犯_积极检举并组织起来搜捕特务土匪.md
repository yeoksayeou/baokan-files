Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, April 18th: In recent months, the People's Governments of Xi'an, Lanzhou, Dihua, Yinchuan, and Xining, responding to the demands of the broad masses of the people, have successively executed a number of counter-revolutionaries. Among the counter-revolutionary criminals executed, some were the principal culprits who undermined national unity, incited armed rebellion, and caused huge losses to people of all ethnic groups; some were notorious habitual bandits; some were special agents who captured, killed, and assassinated democratic figures and patriotic students; and some were heinous local tyrants. After these counter-revolutionary criminals were executed, people of all ethnic groups in Northwest China cheered and were greatly encouraged.

When Lanzhou City executed a group of counter-revolutionaries, it held a forum attended by more than 500 representatives from all walks of life. The representatives eagerly accused the counter-revolutionaries of their crimes at the meeting. When the news of the criminals' execution came, the whole place erupted in cheers. Liang Jingquan, a relative of a martyr, found the corpse of the murderer and pointed at it, saying, "You have this day too!" After Xining City executed a group of bandits and special agents, citizens everywhere discussed: If there are these bad guys, there is no us; if those people are given leniency, we cannot survive. After Ningxia Province shot special agent bandit Zhang Hailu and others, many people said: This is great, we are not afraid of them doing evil again. After Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, executed counter-revolutionary bandits, some old women and young people danced the yangko together, very happy; some old men said: I have never seen such a good world. When Baoji executed counter-revolutionary criminals, residents from dozens of miles away also rushed to see the execution. After Tongguan County shot seven habitual bandits, an old man knelt before the portrait of Chairman Mao and kowtowed in gratitude.

The people of all ethnic groups in Northwest China not only warmly support the People's Government's resolute measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries, but also actively report special agents and organize to search for them. In the Chengfeng Flour Mill in Xi'an City, there were two special agents and leaders of the I-Kuan-Tao sect, known as the "Meng Brothers," who had always persecuted workers and used reactionary secret societies to carry out sabotage activities. The workers of the factory had been monitoring these bandits for a long time, and they fell into the hands of the people when they got up to flee. When representatives from all walks of life in Lanzhou City held a forum on the "Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," the meeting organizer received 23 letters accusing special agents on the spot. After Xining City executed a group of bandits and special agents, the local People's Government received 81 letters from citizens reporting counter-revolutionaries and demanding severe punishment of counter-revolutionaries within two hours. Many people in Huayin County automatically provided materials and clues to help the People's Government collect evidence of the crimes of counter-revolutionaries, making it impossible for the criminals to deny their guilt.

　　西北各族人民欢声雷动
    拥护处决反革命罪犯
    积极检举并组织起来搜捕特务土匪
    【新华社西安十八日电】最近数月来，西安、兰州、迪化、银川和西宁等地人民政府接受广大人民群众的要求，曾先后处决了一批反革命分子。在被枪决的反革命罪犯中，有一批是破坏民族团结、策动武装叛乱，造成各民族人民巨大损失的首恶分子；有一批是著名惯匪；有一批是捕杀和暗害民主人士、爱国学生的特务分子；还有一批是罪恶滔天的恶霸分子。这批反革命罪犯被枪决后，西北各民族人民莫不欢呼振奋。
    兰州市在处决一批反革命分子时，曾举行各界人民代表五百多人的座谈会。代表们争先在会上控诉反革命分子的罪行。当罪犯伏法消息传来时，全场欢呼雷动。烈士家属梁竞权找到凶犯的尸首后，指着尸首说：“你也有今日啊！”西宁市处决一批土匪、特务后，市民群众到处谈论：有这些坏家伙，就没有我们；如果给那些人宽大，我们就活不成。宁夏省枪毙特务匪徒张海禄等后，很多人说：这回可好了，不怕他们再作恶了。陕西省渭南县处决反革命匪犯后，有的老太婆和青年人一起扭秧歌，十分高兴；有些老汉说：真是没见过这样好的世事。宝鸡枪决反革命罪犯时，几十里路以外的居民也赶来看执刑。潼关县枪毙七名惯匪后，有一老汉感激得跪在毛主席肖像前叩头。
    西北各民族人民不仅热烈拥护人民政府坚决镇压反革命的措施，并且积极检举特务和组织起来搜捕特务。西安市成丰面粉厂内有两个号称“孟氏兄弟”的特务兼一贯道头子，一向迫害工人，并利用反动会道门进行破坏活动。该厂工人们老早就监视着这两个匪徒，当他们起身逃跑时就落入了人民的法网。兰州市各界人民代表座谈“惩治反革命条例”时，会议主持者当场收到二十三封控诉特务分子的信函。西宁市枪决一批土匪、特务后，当地人民政府在两小时内即收到市民群众八十一封检举反革命分子与要求严惩反革命分子的信。华阴县很多群众自动供给材料线索，帮助人民政府搜集反革命分子的罪证，使罪犯无法抵赖。
