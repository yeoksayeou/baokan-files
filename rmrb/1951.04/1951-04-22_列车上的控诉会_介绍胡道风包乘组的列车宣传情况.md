    Indictment Meeting on the Train
    Introducing the Train Propaganda Work of Hu Daofeng's Contracted Carriage Group
    Editor:
    During the nationwide campaign to popularize and deepen the resistance against American aggression and aid Korea, train propaganda played a significant role. I am now writing to inform you about the Hu Daofeng contracted carriage group's efforts to mobilize passengers on the train to denounce the American imperialists' plot to rearm Japan.
    On March 25th, while the direct train No. 106 from Xi'an to Beijing was traveling between Baoding and Doudian, the propaganda team of the Hu Daofeng contracted carriage group used 快板 (clapper talk) to propagate to the passengers the American imperialists' plot to rearm Japan. Train attendant Zhu Mingda also denounced the atrocities committed by the Japanese invaders in China. At that time, an old man named Lu Jingfeng, about sixty years old, stood up indignantly and said, "What you are saying is right! My village was burned down by the Japanese devils!" Another old man said with tears in his eyes, "The Japanese devils arrested my son and took him to the military police, where they poured cold water on him, used a lever to press him, and electrocuted him, saying my son was a 'communist soldier.' I sold all the property of my family to redeem my son. After my son came back, he immediately joined the Eighth Route Army to fight the Japanese devils." Then, he denounced the crimes committed by the Japanese invaders in massacring the people of his village, saying, "Once, more than a thousand people in my village were driven out of the village by the Japanese devils, stripped naked, tied to trees, and beaten with whips and stabbed with bayonets. More than six hundred people were either dead or wounded!" At this point, his voice became hoarse and he could not continue.
    At this time, all the passengers on the train were aroused with unparalleled indignation. Some were so moved that they shed tears, and some gnashed their teeth in hatred. Everyone stood up to denounce one after another. When the train was about to reach its destination, the denunciation had not yet ended. Train attendant Zheng Yunzao said to the passengers, "Folks, comrades, we can never finish telling our sufferings. We must turn our hatred into strength and take practical actions to resist American aggression and aid Korea, and not allow American imperialism to rearm Japan." At this time, the train was slowly entering the Beijing East Railway Station, and passenger Wang Tiejun automatically stood up and led everyone to shout slogans. Many passengers said when they got off the train, "I have received a great education today."

    列车上的控诉会
    介绍胡道风包乘组的列车宣传情况编辑同志：
    在全国普及深入抗美援朝运动的时候，列车宣传起了很大的作用。现在我把胡道风包乘组在列车上发动乘客对美帝国主义重新武装日本的阴谋进行控诉的情况告诉你们。
    三月二十五日，由西安开到北京的直达列车一○六次列车行至保定、窦店间时，胡道风包乘组宣传组就用快板向旅客宣传美帝国主义重新武装日本的阴谋，列车员朱明达又控诉了日寇侵华暴行。当时，一个年约六十的老汉卢景风激愤地站起来说：“你们说的对呀！俺村就是叫日本鬼子烧光的呀！”又一个老头含着眼泪说：“日本鬼子把我的儿子抓到宪兵队，灌凉水、压杠子、过电，说我儿子是‘八路’。我把全家所有的财产都卖光了，才赎出了我的儿子。我儿子回来后，马上就参加了八路军，去打日本鬼子。”接着，他又控诉了日寇惨杀他村老百姓的罪行，他说：“有一次，俺村里一千多人被日本鬼子赶到村外，剥光了衣服，捆在树上用鞭子打、用刺刀挑，连死带伤共有六百多人！”他说到这里，声音都嘶哑了，再也说不下去。
    这时，全车旅客都激起了无比的愤恨，有的激动得流眼泪，有的愤恨得咬牙切齿。大家一个接着一个站起来控诉：当列车快到终点站时，控诉还没有结束。列车员郑鋆藻就对旅客说：“老乡们，同志们，咱们的苦是说不完的。咱们要把仇恨变成力量，要以实际行动进行抗美援朝，不叫美帝国主义重新武装日本。”这时列车已经徐徐进入北京东车站，旅客王铁君自动站起来领着大家喊口号。很多旅客下车时说：“我今天受到了很大的教育。”
