　　Preliminary Experiences in Organizing the Masses to Participate in Radio Conferences
　　Tianjin People's Broadcasting Station

　　In order to vigorously mobilize the broad masses of the people of Tianjin to cooperate with the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and to further popularize and deepen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the Tianjin People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the actual situation of the Tianjin Municipal and District Representative Enlarged Conference on March 29th, and held the "Radio Conference for Thoroughly Destroying Reactionary Secret Societies" on April 14th, specifically using five wavelengths for simultaneous joint broadcasting, vigorously organized the city's people to listen, and achieved significant results. Now, the process of organizing the listening, the gains, and the preliminary experiences are described as follows:

　（一）Organizational Mobilization Work Before the Conference

　　I. Sufficient ideological preparation and mobilization work were carried out in advance, and specific arrangements were made according to the organizational system of Tianjin. First, the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (hereinafter referred to as the Radio Station) convened a joint meeting of the leading organs of the city's Party, government, labor unions, youth leagues, and other people's organizations at the Tianjin People's Broadcasting Station. The meeting focused on explaining the great significance of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the purpose of the radio station's rebroadcast, and the specific plans for the rebroadcast and listening work. Finally, a notice was jointly issued by eight units, including the Municipal People's Government, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Radio Station, organizing the listening to the broadcast. After the meeting, the leading cadres of the Party, government, labor unions, and youth leagues of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, various people's organizations, and factories and enterprises immediately arranged this work according to the systems of their respective units. In order to organize the general public to listen, under the leadership of the District Committees of the Communist Party of China, in coordination with relevant departments, the Public Security Branch Bureaus organized listening through the police stations. Middle schools were notified by the Municipal Education Bureau to suspend classes for listening (to be made up later), and the school administrations took charge separately. Many primary schools and universities also voluntarily suspended classes for listening. Cadres of various organs were notified and organized to listen by the Municipal Government and various leading departments. In addition, through the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, merchants were mobilized to broadcast the radio amplifiers to the streets for the convenience of mobile citizens to listen. II. In order to mobilize all personnel of the factory broadcasting stations and family committees to closely cooperate with the Party, government, labor unions, and youth leagues of various units to do a good job in organizing the listening, and to play a backbone role, the Radio Station convened a joint meeting of the directors of the city's broadcasting stations and family committees before the conference, with 83 units attending. The Radio Station specifically arranged the work of organizing the listening. All the reporters of the Radio Station went deep into the grassroots to organize listening and inspection work in a timely manner. At the same time, with the conditions of having listening equipment, a meeting place, and the ability for most workers and the general public to listen, and taking into account the "breadth" and representativeness, District 1 (the central urban area), District 5, District 9 (mostly suburban areas), and District 7 (mostly family listening) were selected as the focus in the urban area. In factories, the focus was on Cotton Textile Factories No. 1 and No. 2, Steel Factory, Clothing Factory No. 4 Sewing Department, General Paper Mill, Railway Bureau, and Tram Company; and the objects and organization methods of listening were determined according to specific conditions such as production time, nature, listening equipment, and concentration points. In Cotton Textile Factory No. 2 alone, about 3,000 employees and their families were organized to listen collectively; in the citizens, in Districts 8 and 9 alone, more than 91,000 people were organized to listen collectively. Other districts organized collective listening of 100, 200, 500, 1,000 to 5,000 people. In addition, the police stations and household registration representatives went to various districts to organize 6,500 listening groups with a focus.

　（二）Situation During the Listening Process

　　According to the reports and statistics from the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, the Education Bureau, and various factories, organs, and Tangda District: on the evening of the live broadcast of the enlarged meeting of representatives from all walks of life in the city and districts, as many as 500,000 workers, students, and people from all walks of life listened (later, there were successive rebroadcasts, with a total of about 900,000 listeners). The radio station's nine telephone lines received more than 2,000 calls and more than 600 letters from people from all walks of life in just three hours that day, unanimously demanding that the government severely punish counter-revolutionaries who have committed heinous crimes and are incorrigible. When Wang Shuyun accused the bully Wang Shijiang at the meeting, the emotions of the listening masses in all places suddenly rose, and they were extremely angry, shouting loudly: "Shoot Wang Shijiang and avenge the dead!" Some pedestrians on the street stopped; many rickshaw pullers stopped pulling; some vendors stopped doing business; some patients in the hospital also listened to the radio. When the meeting announced the escort of a group of counter-revolutionary criminals, the listeners of the Telecommunications Branch Bureau stood up and looked forward unconsciously, forgetting that they were not at the meeting. During the "Radio Conference for Thoroughly Destroying Reactionary Secret Societies," about 460,000 people listened to the broadcast. After listening to the report of Tianjin Mayor Huang Jing, 12,000 I-Kuan Tao followers notified the radio station by telephone or went to the police station in person to declare their withdrawal from the Tao that night. The situation at the conference was extremely enthusiastic.

　（三）Gains After the Conference

　　After listening to the live broadcast of the enlarged meeting of representatives from all walks of life in Tianjin, people from all walks of life in Tianjin sincerely supported the government's measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries and firmly demanded that the government severely punish the chief culprits of counter-revolutionaries. In the two radio conferences, the radio station received more than 60,000 manuscripts of citizens signing in support of the government's measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries and more than 3,000 consecutive calls. There were 48 long-distance calls and 12 reports. The radio station also received patriotic anti-espionage covenants signed by more than 100 units. In the factories, the workers further linked the specific situation of their units and formulated anti-espionage covenants and specific guarantees. Only the Steel Factory, Bicycle Factory, Cotton Textile Factory No. 6, Railway Bureau, Cotton Textile Machinery Factories, and dock workers have formulated patriotic covenants or guarantees. More than 40 units under the Industrial Bureau launched a mass safety movement and proposed the implementation of a machine safety responsibility system and other systems. After listening to the broadcast, the employees of the Rolling Stock Factory of the Railway Bureau asked to join the picket team to protect the factory, and the number of pickets in the factory has doubled compared with the past. On March 29, all the employees of the No. 4 Clothing Factory intensified their work while listening to the broadcast. They produced two more sets of work per person that afternoon, and the output has been rising. Through this broadcast, the general public has a deeper understanding of the heinous crimes of counter-revolutionaries, which aroused greater hatred of the people against counter-revolutionaries. The general intellectuals and middle and upper-class people have also further understood the essence of counter-revolutionaries, and they all applauded when the counter-revolutionary criminals were shot.

　（四）Several Experiences

　　The two radio conferences have achieved great results in terms of both the extensive mobilization of the masses and the propaganda and mobilization effect. We believe that the following points can be used as experience for organizing radio conferences or large-scale live broadcasts in the future.

　　I. Organizing radio conferences should be closely integrated with the current central work. Because suppressing counter-revolutionaries is the current central work, the assistance of all parties was immediately obtained during the large-scale mobilization and organization of listening. Whether it is the Party, the government, or people's organizations, they all believe that this organization of listening is inseparable from their work, and they attached great importance to it and enthusiastically undertook the task of organizing listening. Various people's organizations and public security departments mobilized more than 1,000 cadres to do this work. The administrations of factories and the Municipal Education Bureau automatically suspended work and classes to listen. Many secretaries of district committees of the Communist Party of China, factory directors, and chairmen of labor unions personally attended to grasp the actual situation of the listening conference. The Second District temporarily mobilized cadres to deeply lead. The district committees of the Communist Party of China generally convened temporary meetings to arrange the listening work.

　　II. We should grasp the main issues that the masses are concerned about. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries is the most reflected in the masses. Before the conference, newspapers, radio stations and other propaganda departments had already carried out certain work. Many districts or police stations had generally held small-scale accusation meetings, and the emotions of the masses had begun to move. Therefore, the masses were very concerned about this listening, forming a climax of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

　　III. Give full play to the power of the organization and strive for the assistance of the leading organs. For example, in the first radio conference, the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China invited the Propaganda Departments of the District Committees of the Communist Party of China, government organs, factory administrations, labor unions, and other people's organizations to hold a meeting and issue a joint notice to arrange the listening. Facts have proved that it is impossible to organize such a large-scale listening without going through various organizations - relying solely on the power of the radio station.

　　IV. Grasping inspection and assistance is also an important part of promoting listening work. In the two conferences, most of the comrades of the radio station editorial department went to the districts and factories to understand the situation in real time and put forward suggestions, so that this work could be promoted faster.

　　In addition, before the broadcast, publicity should be carried out through newspapers and various propaganda departments to help the development of the work. The broadcast time should not be too long, so that the masses can concentrate on listening. Three hours or so is more appropriate. The broadcast words should be simple, specific, and vivid, and avoid profound theories and lengthy speeches. During the listening, the radio station should promptly carry out mobilization through broadcasting to closely integrate the large and small meetings to fill the masses with emotion. In terms of organizing listening: in large factories (if there are listening equipment and meeting places, etc.), collective listening is more appropriate; in districts and streets, it is generally better to organize residents' groups to listen in a decentralized manner; if there is a lack of radios, to organize collective listening, the number of people should not be too large, 100 or 200 people are more appropriate, and someone needs to control the order of the meeting.

　　组织群众参加广播大会的初步经验
    天津市人民广播电台
    为大力动员天津市广大人民协同政府一起来镇压反革命，并进一步普及与深入抗美援朝运动，天津市人民广播电台曾于三月二十九日转播了天津市市、区各界代表扩大会议的实况，并于四月十四日举行了“彻底摧毁反动会道门广播大会”，特地以五个波长同时联合广播，大力组织了全市人民进行收听，并获得了显著的成效。现把组织收听的过程、收获和初步经验分述如下：
  （一）大会前的组织动员工作
    一、事先作了充分的思想准备和动员工作，按天津市各组织系统作了具体布置。首由中共天津市委宣传部在天津市人民广播电台（以后简称电台）召集了全市党、政、工、团及其他人民团体领导机关的联席会议。会上着重说明镇压反革命的重大意义和电台转播的目的，以及转播与收听工作的具体计划。最后并通过由到会的市人民政府、市总工会、电台等八个单位联名发布通知，组织收听广播。会后，市公安局、各人民团体、工厂企业的党、政、工、团领导干部，分别按各单位系统立即布置了这一工作。为组织一般市民收听，在中共区委会领导下，配合各有关部门，由各公安分局通过派出所组织收听。中学则由市教育局通知各校停课收听（以后补课），并由各学校行政分头掌握。许多小学和大学也自动停课收听。各机关干部则由市府及各领导部门分别通知组织收听。此外，并通过市公安局及工商联合会动员商户将收音机扩大器向街头放送，以供流动市民收听。二、电台为了动员各厂广播站与家属委员会全体人员，能紧密配合各单位党、政、工、团作好组织收听工作，并在其中起骨干作用，在大会前，曾召集了全市广播站与家属委员会主任联席会议，到会有八十三个单位。由电台具体布置了组织收听的工作。电台全部记者则及时深入下层组织收听与检查工作。同时以具有收听设备、有集合的会场和大部工人及一般市民都能收听为条件，并照顾到“面”的广泛性和代表性，在市区中选择了一区（市中心区）、五区、九区（大部为郊区）、七区（大部为家庭收听）为重点。在工厂中，则以棉纺一、二厂、钢厂、被服厂第四缝纫部、造纸总厂、铁路局、电车公司为重点；并根据生产时间、性质、收听设备、集中地点等具体情况，确定了收听的对象和组织办法。仅棉纺二厂一处，即有职工及其家属约三千人组织了集体收听；在市民中仅八、九两区，组织集体收听者，即达九万一千余人。其他各区都组织了一百、二百、五百、一千到五千人集体收听。此外，并由各派出所及户政代表有重点地分别赴各区组织了六千五百个收听小组。
  （二）收听过程中的情况
    据天津市公安局、教育局以及各工厂、机关及塘大区的汇报统计：当晚收听市、区各界代表扩大会议的实况转播的工人、学生及各界人民，即达五十万人（以后又陆续转播，收听者共约九十万人）。电台的九部电话机，仅在当天三小时内，即收到各界人民的电话二千多次，信件六百余封，一致要求政府严惩罪大恶极、怙恶不悛的反革命分子。当大会上王淑云控诉恶霸王士姜时，各处收听群众，情绪骤然高涨，愤恨异常，大声疾呼：“枪毙王士姜，为死者报仇！”有的街头上的行人止步了；不少三轮车工人连坐也不拉了；有些小贩连买卖也不作了；有的医院的病人也收听起广播来了。当会场宣布押出来一批反革命罪犯时，电信一分局的听众都不约而同地站起来往前看，忘记了自己不在会场。在举行“彻底摧毁反动会道门广播大会”时，约有四十六万群众收听广播。一贯道道徒在听了天津市黄敬市长的报告以后，当晚有一万二千人，分别以电话通知电台或亲至派出所声明退道。大会的情况至为热烈。
  （三）会后的收获
    天津市各阶层人民听完了天津市市、区各界代表扩大会议实况转播以后，都竭诚拥护政府镇压反革命的措施，并坚决要求政府严惩反革命首恶分子。在两次广播大会中，电台接到六万多市民签名拥护政府镇压反革命措施的稿件及连续三千余次的电话。长途电话有四十八次，检举稿件有十二件。电台还接到了一百多单位订立的反特务爱国公约。在工厂中工人们进一步联系了本单位的具体情况，订出了反特务公约和具体保证。仅钢厂、自行车厂、棉纺六厂、铁路局、棉纺机械各厂及码头工人等单位，绝大部分都订出了爱国公约或保证。工业局所属四十多个单位，展开了群众性的安全运动，提出推行机器安全负责制等制度。铁路局车辆工厂收听广播后，职工纷纷要求加入纠察队保护工厂，该厂现有纠察队人数较过去增加了一倍。被服四厂全体职工，在三月二十九日，一面收听广播，一面加紧干活，当天下午每人多出了两套活；产量并一直上升。通过这次广播，使一般市民更深刻地认识到反革命分子的滔天罪行，激起了人民对反革命分子更大的仇恨。一般知识分子及中上层人士，也进一步了解到反革命的本质，在枪毙反革命罪犯时，都一致称快。
  （四）几点经验
    两次广播大会，无论就发动群众的广泛性上与宣传鼓动所收得的效果上来说，都有很大的成绩。我们认为下面几点，可作为今后组织广播大会或大规模实况转播的经验。
    一、组织广播大会，应密切地结合当前的中心工作。由于镇压反革命是当前的中心工作，因此，在大规模动员组织收听时，立即得到了各方面的协助。无论党、政、人民团体，都认为这次的组织收听和他们的工作密不可分，给与了极大的重视，踊跃地担负起组织收听的任务。各人民团体及公安部门，动员了一千余干部做这一工作。工厂的行政、市教育局自动停工、停课进行收听，中共各区区委书记、工厂厂长、工会主席有许多亲自出席掌握收听大会实况。二区更临时调动干部深入领导。中共区委会普遍召开了临时会议，布置了收听工作。
    二、应抓住群众所关心的主要问题。镇压反革命在群众中反映最多，在大会之前无论报纸、电台和其他宣传部门都已经进行了一定的工作，许多区或派出所普遍地开过小型的控诉会，群众的情绪已经开始动起来，因此群众很关心这次的收听，形成镇压反革命的高潮。
    三、充分发挥组织的力量，争取领导机关的协助。如第一次广播大会即由中共天津市委宣传部邀集了中共各区委宣传部、政府机关、工厂行政、工会等人民团体的会议，发出联合通知布置收听。事实证明，如果不通过各种组织——单依靠电台的力量，要组织这样大规模的收听是不可能的。
    四、抓紧检查和帮助，也是推动收听工作的重要一环。两次大会中，电台编辑部同志绝大部分到区和工厂学校里面，即时了解情况，提出建议，使这次工作推动得更快一些。
    此外，在广播前，应通过报纸和各宣传部门进行宣传，方能帮助工作的开展。广播时间不宜太长，使群众集中收听，以三小时左右较为适宜。广播词力求通俗、具体、生动，切忌高深理论和冗长的演说。在收听时，电台应及时通过广播进行鼓动，使大会和小会密切结合，以饱满群众情绪。在组织收听方面：在大工厂中（如有收听设备和会场等条件），以集体收听较为适宜；在区、街，一般以分散组织居民小组收听较好；如缺乏收音机，要组织集体收听，人数不宜太多，以一、二百人较为适宜，且需要有人掌握会场秩序。
