The Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting on typical work in establishing propaganda networks from March 25th to 30th to study and summarize the experiences of various regions in East China in conducting pilot projects for establishing propaganda networks.

Various provinces, districts, and cities in East China began to establish propaganda networks in conjunction with the Peace Signature Campaign in August and September of last year. Shandong, Subei, and Sunan provinces and regions alone developed more than 50,000 propagandists during the Peace Signature Campaign, which played a certain role in promoting the Peace Signature Campaign, the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, and various other tasks. However, at that time, the understanding of the significance and standards of establishing propaganda networks was not clear, and the work of establishing propaganda networks was still in the nature of a pilot project, and most of the propaganda networks established were temporary propaganda teams. Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Decision on Establishing Propaganda Networks for the People throughout the Party" and after the Third Propaganda Work Conference of East China, all provinces, districts, and cities held propaganda conferences, reviewed the past situation of establishing propaganda networks, and formulated implementation plans for establishing propaganda networks within six months. Subei, Sunan, Southern Anhui, Northern Anhui and the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee selected base points for typical experiments. At present, the work of establishing propaganda networks in various parts of East China is being carried out more universally. According to incomplete statistics, there are already more than 116,000 propagandists in East China, excluding Fujian Province. In order to study and summarize the typical work experience of establishing propaganda networks in various places, and to guide and promote the work of establishing propaganda networks in various places, the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau convened a meeting on typical work in establishing propaganda networks in East China on March 25. The conference listened to typical reports on the establishment of propaganda networks in several cities and rural areas, and after one and a half days of group and plenary discussions, Comrade Shu Tong, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau, made a summary.

In his summary, Comrade Shu Tong pointed out: The biggest defect in our propaganda work in the past was the lack of a regular organization and leadership for our propaganda teams, so that in the execution of many tasks, we often only adopted simple administrative orders, while the absurd propaganda of reactionary elements could often temporarily occupy the market. Therefore, the establishment of a propaganda network organization is an effective way to eliminate this defect, especially in the current process of continuing to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.

The purpose of this meeting is to summarize the typical work experience of establishing propaganda networks in various places, so as to promote the comprehensive establishment of propaganda network work in a planned way. The preliminary experience of establishing propaganda networks in various places can be summarized as follows:

First, it is necessary to open up the thinking of cadres and propagandists. All cadres, especially leading cadres, must clearly understand that the establishment of a propaganda network is an important key to closely linking the Party with the masses, an important weapon for promoting various tasks, and a necessary measure for improving the Party's leadership methods and work style, in order to smoothly carry out the work of establishing a propaganda network. For grassroots cadres, they should understand from their practical work experience that "propaganda work is an important reason for doing a good job; if propaganda work is not done well, it will be difficult to complete the task." For Party members or revolutionary activists who serve as propagandists, they should understand the role, conditions, tasks, and working methods of propagandists, so that they feel that it is glorious to strive to be a Party propagandist, and dispel their ideological concerns about delaying production and being unable to be a propagandist.

Second, we must combine various practical tasks and establish propaganda networks through current mass movements. Party committees at all levels should attach importance to this and effectively provide leadership and management. The branch secretary should be directly responsible for the leadership, so as to give full play to the active role of the propaganda network and avoid the tendency of formalism. We should summarize our work so that everyone can appreciate the importance of establishing a propaganda network from practical experience, earnestly study the Central Committee's "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People," and formulate a work plan for establishing a propaganda network that is closely integrated with the central task.

Third, we must strictly select propagandists from among Party members and revolutionary activists in accordance with the conditions stipulated by the Central Committee, and prevent the tendency of demanding too much or padding the numbers. When selecting propagandists, we should first focus on cadres in various systems (such as Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League in factories), and take into account various mass propaganda organizations (such as blackboards, wall newspapers, and radio stations) and the distribution of various units. The approval procedures for propagandists must be strictly followed.

Fourth, we must reorganize the past organizations and consolidate the existing foundation. Old propaganda networks that do not meet the requirements should not be completely rejected, nor should they be retained unchanged without distinction. When reorganizing, we should affirm the achievements of the original propaganda network and explain the difference between Party and non-Party propaganda networks. Propagandists who meet the requirements should be retained, and those who do not meet the requirements should generally be transferred to mass propaganda organizations, and individual impure elements should be purged. The processing should be reviewed and approved by the branch committee, and approved by the higher-level Party organization. Consolidating the propaganda network should first strengthen the Party committee's regular leadership over propaganda work, and constantly summarize propaganda work experience from practical work, and strengthen the ideological style and business education of propagandists to improve the political quality and work ability of propagandists. Subei proposed to be a good propagandist: "To set an example, don't just talk; to learn modestly, don't be arrogant; to combine with reality, don't talk big; to have roots and according to, don't talk nonsense." It can be used as a reference for all regions. The education of propagandists should mainly be carried out regularly through meetings, reports, and summary work; short-term training courses can also be held in places where conditions permit. In the organizational consolidation work, Party committees at all levels should formulate a system for inspecting propaganda work, and the county Party committee should implement a system for convening representative meetings of propagandists or joint meetings of branch secretaries or propagandist conferences, and the district Party committee should establish a transmission station system, and should establish and adhere to a system of meetings, reports, and planning for propagandists, determine the division of labor of propagandists, so that each propagandist has a fixed propaganda object and propaganda position. Party committees at all levels should pay close attention to the work of supplying propaganda materials to propagandists, and overcome the shortcomings of the current supply of propaganda materials being too small, untimely, and unsuitable.

Fifth, the establishment of a propaganda network must combine points and areas, popularize on one side and improve on the other. When universally establishing propaganda networks, it is required that each district grasp a key point, and comprehensively promote it in a planned and step-by-step manner. The focus of the central work in various places should also be the focus of establishing propaganda networks. Comrades sent down by Party committees at all levels to help with the work should also be assigned the task of experimenting or inspecting the establishment of propaganda networks, so as to absorb experience for guidance at any time.

### 华东局宣传部总结建立宣传网经验

　　华东局宣传部总结建立宣传网经验
    中共中央华东局宣传部于三月二十五日至三十日召开建立宣传网典型工作会议，研究并总结了华东各地建立宣传网典型试验的经验。
    华东各省、区、市在去年八、九月间，即结合和平签名运动着手建立宣传网，仅山东、苏北、苏南等省区即在和平签名运动中发展宣传员五万余人，对推动和平签名运动、抗美援朝运动及各项工作均起了一定作用。但当时对建立宣传网的意义及标准认识尚不明确，建立宣传网工作还是试办性质，所建立的宣传网亦大多属于临时性的宣传队伍。自中共中央发布关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定及华东第三次宣传工作会议以后，各省、区、市均召开了宣传会议，检查了过去建立宣传网的情况，制订了半年内建立宣传网的实施计划。苏南、苏北、皖南、皖北等区及上海市委并分别选择基点进行典型试验。目前，华东各地建立宣传网的工作，正在较普遍地开展中。据不完全的统计，全华东除福建省外已有宣传员十一万六千余人。华东局宣传部为了研究与总结各地建立宣传网典型试验的经验，指导并推动各地建立宣传网的工作，遂于三月二十五日召开华东建立宣传网典型工作会议。大会听取了若干城市、农村建立宣传网的典型汇报，又经一天半小组与大会讨论，最后由华东局宣传部部长舒同同志总结。
    舒同同志在总结中指出：过去我们的宣传队伍没有经常的组织和领导，是我们宣传工作中最大的缺陷，以致在许多工作执行时往往只采取简单的行政命令，而反动分子的荒谬宣传，反而常能暂时地占领市场。故建立宣传网的组织乃是消灭此种缺陷的有效方法，特别在目前继续普及与深入抗美援朝运动的过程中，尤为重要。
    此次会议的目的即是为了总结各地建立宣传网的典型工作经验，以便有计划地推动全面的建立宣传网工作。总结各地目前建立宣传网的初步经验，大致有以下几点：
    第一、必须打通干部与宣传员的思想。必须使全体干部特别是领导干部明确认识建立宣传网是密切党与群众联系的重要关键，是推动各项任务的重要武器和改善党的领导方法与工作作风的必要措施，才能使建立宣传网的工作顺利开展。对基层干部要使他们从实际工作体验中，了解“工作能做得好，宣传工作是一个重要原因；宣传工作做不好，完成任务就很困难”的道理。对担任宣传员的党员或革命积极分子，应使他们了解宣传员的作用、条件、工作任务和工作方法，使他们感到争取做一个党的宣传员是光荣的，解除其怕耽误生产与怕当不了宣传员等思想顾虑。
    第二、必须结合各种实际工作，通过当前群众运动来建立宣传网。各级党委都应加以重视，切实予以领导和管理。支部书记应该直接负责领导，以发挥宣传网的积极作用，避免流于形式主义的偏向。应通过总结工作使大家从实际经验中体会建立宣传网的重要，并认真学习中央关于建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定，订立与中心工作密切相结合的建立宣传网的工作计划。
    第三、必须严格按照中央规定的条件，在党员和革命积极分子中正确地选拔宣传员，防止要求过高与滥竽充数的偏向。在选拔宣传员时，应首先以各系统干部为主（如工厂中的党、政、工、团等），并照顾各种群众性宣传组织（如黑板报、墙报、广播台等）及各单位中的分布状况。并必须严格遵守宣传员的批准手续。
    第四、必须整理过去的组织，巩固现有的基础。对不够条件的旧有宣传网不应一脚踢开，也不应不加区分地原封保留。整理时应肯定原有宣传网的成绩，并说明党与非党宣传网的区别。对其中宣传员符合条件的应予保留，不合条件的一般应转入群众性的宣传组织，个别成份不纯的应加以洗刷。处理时应经过支部委员会审查通过，上一级党的组织批准。巩固宣传网首先应加强党委对宣传工作的经常领导，并不断从实际工作中总结宣传工作经验，及加强对宣传员的思想作风与业务教育，提高宣传员的政治质量与工作能力。苏北提出做一个好的宣传员：“要以身作则，不要光说不做；要虚心学习，不要骄傲自大；要结合实际，不要夸夸其谈；要有根有据，不要信口开河。”可供各地参考。对宣传员的教育，主要应从会议、汇报、总结工作中经常进行；有条件的地方并可开办短期训练班。在组织上的巩固工作，各级党委应订出检查宣传工作的制度，县委应执行召开宣传员代表会议或支部书记联席会或宣传员大会的制度，区委应建立传授站的制度，并应建立与坚持宣传员的会议汇报和订立计划的制度，确定宣传员的分工，使每个宣传员都有固定的宣传对象与宣传阵地。各级党委都应认真注意供给宣传员宣传资料的工作，克服目前宣传资料供给太少和不及时不适合需要的缺点。
    第五、建立宣传网必须点面结合，一面普及，一面提高。在普遍建立宣传网时要求每区掌握一个重点，并有计划地、有步骤地全面地推广。各地中心工作的重点应同时为建立宣传网的重点，各级党委派下去帮助工作的同志应同时交代其实验或检查建立宣传网的任务，以随时吸取经验进行指导。
