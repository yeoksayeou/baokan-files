　　Anti-American and Aid-Korea Dynamic
　　Guangdong Province Widely Carries Out the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
    The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Guangdong Province has been widely promoted to various small and medium-sized cities and some rural areas. According to preliminary statistics from the four special districts of Zhujiang, Yuezhong, Beijiang, Xingmei, and the Qiongyai Administrative Region, more than 3,025,000 people from all walks of life participated in parades and demonstrations. Popular accusation meetings were held in Qiongyai, Panyu, Zhongshan, Shunde, Foshan and other places. In Qiongyai alone, more than 100,000 people participated, and almost every village held an accusation meeting. The movement has been better developed in the Zhujiang Special District and Jiangmen City. Due to the importance attached by the leading organs in Zhujiang Special District, emphasizing the importance of current affairs propaganda, and calling on "current affairs reports must be made in large and small meetings," cadres at all levels have also experienced the importance of current affairs propaganda from their own work, and gradually changed the past misconception that "propaganda work is the business of the propaganda department," thus the movement has developed more widely and deeply. Because of the development of the patriotic movement, the political awareness of the broad masses has been raised a step further, and the view of hating American imperialism has been generally established. The movement has also played a significant role in promoting various aspects of work. Inspired by the patriotic upsurge, farmers quickly completed tasks such as paying public grain. Under the slogan of "Pay monthly tax on time, fulfill patriotic conventions," and "Oppose the United States arming Japan, complete tax payment tasks quickly," the industrial and commercial circles in Shantou, Zhanjiang and other cities paid taxes on time or collectively. However, the development of the movement is still uneven. There are still "blank areas" in large and medium-sized cities that have not been eliminated, and many rural areas have not yet been well developed. Some places remain at general slogans and are satisfied with grand scenes, lacking systematic and in-depth education. The movement lacks regular and sustained work and is prone to hot and cold diseases. According to these situations, the provincial leading organs have recently convened various meetings to re-arrange the work. In order to have a special organization to be responsible for the daily guidance of the movement, the Guangdong Provincial Resist America, Aid Korea Association has been established, and it has been decided to send inspection teams to various places to inspect and promote the Resist America, Aid Korea work recently.
  The Situation of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Zhejiang Province
    The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Zhejiang Province has been launched throughout the province. According to statistics from Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou and forty-nine counties, a total of more than 5,370,000 people participated in the patriotic parade to resist America and aid Korea. Among them, more than 400 townships in Jiaxing Special District have launched the movement, and more than 100 townships are continuing to carry it out; 90% of the villages in Hangxian County have launched the movement. The harvest of the movement is very large, the number of people participating in the movement and the speed of the masses' political understanding are unprecedented. Based on the political consciousness of the masses, all aspects of work in Zhejiang Province have been carried out smoothly. Taking workers' participation in patriotic production competitions as an example, according to incomplete statistics in mid-March, 102 grassroots units across the province have participated in patriotic production competitions, with more than 38,000 employees participating. The farmers in the province also enthusiastically launched production competitions. In Xindeng County, more than 17,000 farmers signed production plans. Some government cadres have also formulated patriotic covenants, which have greatly improved work efficiency. However, the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Zhejiang Province currently has shortcomings in insufficient depth. Although lectures, accusations, and parades are generally carried out, most of them ignore the close integration of signing patriotic covenants with practical actions, and some covenant clauses are copied from newspapers. When organizing accusation meetings, some places only focus on a few typical figures to sue back and forth, and fail to deeply mobilize more victimized people to make accusations, thus failing to form a mass accusation.
  The Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement in Nanjing Turns to Depth
    The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Nanjing has been widely launched. After late February, the city, focusing on opposing the United States arming Japan, convened recollection and accusation meetings in various streets, alleys and neighborhoods, accusing the Japanese invaders of their atrocities in Nanjing. There were tens of thousands of accusation meetings and commemorative meetings. According to estimates by the leading organs of Nanjing, more than 80% of the people in the city have received patriotic education. A large number of activists emerged during the movement, and the enthusiasm of the masses was very high. The city is currently carrying out the work of formulating patriotic covenants. However, the development of the movement is still uneven, and some "blank areas" remain to be broken through. Many people still do not understand why they should resist America and aid Korea and how to resist America and aid Korea. Some places have not closely integrated the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement with their current work. Some meetings are over and the matter is over. In terms of propaganda, some propaganda content only emphasizes the past crimes of the Japanese invaders, and insufficient propaganda is given to the conspiracies of American imperialism today. The patriotic covenants signed are generally empty and lengthy, and residents reflect that "there are too many, I can't remember them, how can I implement them?" The leading organs of Nanjing are working on solving the problem of deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.
  The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Kaifeng City
    From mid-December last year to mid-March this year, people from all walks of life in Kaifeng City and farmers in suburban areas held seven grand parades to resist America and aid Korea, with a total of more than 175,000 participants, accounting for more than half of the city's population. The city also organized more than 100 accusation meetings, with more than 110,000 participants. In terms of literary and artistic propaganda, 25 kinds of anti-aggression literary and artistic booklets were published, with a total distribution of more than 200,000 copies. Other organizations such as film projection teams and various exhibitions have achieved good results. After this movement, the anti-American and patriotic sentiments of people from all walks of life have grown unprecedentedly, and the confused thoughts of many people have been clarified.
    The main experiences of Kaifeng City in carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement are: (1) The leading organs always attach importance to this movement. (2) Widely organize and use various social forces to establish close contact with all parties. (3) Understand the movement situation, pay attention to the development of the movement, and prevent deviations. (4) Make literary and artistic propaganda meet the requirements of the local masses. The main shortcomings in the movement are that the idea of relying on workers is not clear, and not enough attention is paid to current affairs propaganda and education for workers.

专栏：抗美援朝动态

　　抗美援朝动态
　  广东省抗美援朝运动广泛开展
    广东省的抗美援朝运动已广泛地推向各个中小城市和部分农村。据珠江、粤中、北江、兴梅四个专区和琼崖行政区的初步统计，各界人民参加游行示威的有三百零二万五千余人。琼崖、番禺、中山、顺德、佛山等地普遍进行了控诉集会，仅琼崖区即有十多万人参加，几乎每一个村子都进行过控诉集会。运动在珠江专区和江门市开展得较好。珠江专区由于领导机关重视，强调时事宣传的重要，并号召“大会小会必作时事报告”，各级干部也从本身工作中体验到时事宣传的重要，逐渐改变过去认为“宣传工作是宣传部门的事”的错误观点，因而运动发展得比较广泛、深入。因为爱国运动的开展，广大群众的政治认识提高了一步，仇视美帝国主义的观点普遍地建立起来了。运动对推动各方面的工作，也起了很大作用。农民在爱国高潮的鼓舞下，迅速完成了缴纳公粮等任务。汕头、湛江等市工商界在“月税月清，履行爱国公约”，“反对美国武装日本，赶快完成交税任务”的口号下依期纳税或集体纳税。但是运动发展还不平衡，大中城市尚有“空白区”未消灭，许多农村仍未很好开展。有的地方停留在一般的口号和满足于轰轰烈烈的大场面，缺乏系统深入的教育。运动缺乏经常性持久性的工作，易犯冷热病。该省领导机关根据这些情况，已于最近分别召集各种会议，重作布置。为使运动能有专门的机构来负责日常指导工作，已成立广东省抗美援朝会，并决定最近派出巡视团，前往各地检查和推动抗美援朝工作。
  浙江抗美援朝运动的情况
    浙江省抗美援朝运动已在全省各地展开。据杭州、宁波、温州三市及四十九县统计，参加抗美援朝爱国游行的人数共达五百三十七万余人。其中嘉兴专区有四百多个乡开展了运动，有百余乡正在继续进行；杭县百分之九十的乡村展开了运动。运动的收获是很大的，参加运动群众之多，群众政治认识提高之快都是空前的。在群众政治觉悟的基础上，浙江省各方面工作都得以顺利开展。以工人参加爱国生产竞赛为例，根据三月中旬的不完全统计，全省已有一百零二个基层单位参加爱国生产竞赛，参加的职工达三万八千余人。该省农民也热烈地展开生产竞赛，新登一个县有一万七千余户农民订了生产计划。有的机关干部也订立了爱国公约，大大提高了工作效率。但浙江省的抗美援朝运动目前仍有不够深入的缺点。一般虽进行讲演、控诉、游行，但大多忽视了签订爱国公约要与实际行动密切结合，有些公约条文是照报纸上抄的。在组织控诉会时，有的地方只抓住几个典型人物诉来诉去，未能深入发动更多的受害群众进行控诉，因而未能形成群众性的控诉。
  南京市抗美援朝运动转向深入
    南京市的抗美援朝运动已广泛开展。二月下旬后，该市即以反对美国武装日本为中心，召开了各街巷里弄的回忆控诉会，控诉日寇在南京的暴行。控诉会和纪念会数以万计，据南京市领导机关的估计，全市有百分之八十以上的人民受到了爱国教育。运动中涌现出大批积极分子，群众情绪甚为高涨。目前该市正在开展订立爱国公约的工作。但运动的发展还不平衡，还有些“空白区”尚待突破。为什么要抗美援朝、怎样抗美援朝，不少人仍然搞不清楚。有的地方还没有把抗美援朝运动与当前工作密切结合。有的是会开完了，事情也就完了。在宣传方面，有些宣传内容只强调了日寇过去的罪恶，对今天美国帝国主义的阴谋却宣传不够。签订的爱国公约，普遍是空洞冗长，居民反映“太多了，记不清，怎能实行？”南京市领导机关正在着手解决深入开展抗美援朝运动的问题。
  开封市的抗美援朝运动
    开封市自去年十二月中旬到今年三月中旬，城市各界人民和郊区农民曾分别举行了七次抗美援朝大游行，参加的人数共有十七万五千以上，占全市人口二分之一强。该市并组织了一百余次的控诉集会，参加的人数达十一万余人。在文艺宣传方面，出版了反侵略文艺小丛书二十五种，共发行了二十万份以上。其他组织电影放映队、各种展览会，都获得了良好的效果。经过这一运动，各界人民的反美爱国情绪空前增长，澄清了不少人的糊涂思想。
    开封市开展抗美援朝运动的主要经验是：（一）领导机关经常地重视这一运动。（二）广泛组织和运用各种社会力量，与各方面取得紧密联系。（三）了解运动情况，注意运动发展，预防偏向。（四）使文艺性的宣传切合当地群众的要求。运动中的主要缺点是依靠工人的思想不明确，对工人的时事宣传教育尚不够重视。
