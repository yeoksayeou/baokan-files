　　Mianyang Shithang Township Suppressed Counter-Revolutionaries
  　Return of Deposits Completed in One Day
Editor:
    In Shithang Township, Ninth District of Mianyang County, Sichuan, the leadership of the Fourth Branch of the Farmers' Association was usurped by counter-revolutionary element Zhang Zhongsan and his cronies, rendering the return of deposits impossible. After the People's Government mobilized the masses to cleanse the Farmers' Association of counter-revolutionary elements and detain them for handling by the People's Court, the deposit return work of the branch progressed rapidly and was quickly completed.
    The counter-revolutionary element Zhang Zhongsan was a Kuomintang member, the head of the reactionary secret society "Revival Society," and a leader of Yiguandao. Before liberation, he served as a puppet Bao chief, puppet security captain, etc., committing all kinds of evils such as murder, robbery, rape, and selling conscripts. When the area was about to be liberated, he organized the "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," plotting to resist our army. After liberation, the bandit organized a fake Farmers' Association and threatened farmers to elect him as director. He frequently held meetings to threaten the masses not to approach cadres and forced farmers to join Yiguandao. Each farmer who joined the cult was forced to pay a fee of two silver dollars.
    In July 1950, our county's People's Government discovered the above situation and immediately cleaned Zhang, the bandit, out of the Farmers' Association and detained him. Zhang then instructed his lackeys, Zhang Junxian (rich peasant) and Yang Yun (Kuomintang member, secretary of the Three People's Principles Youth League branch), the puppet town chief of Chengbei Town, to infiltrate the Farmers' Association and usurp the leadership of the Fourth Branch, continuing their evil deeds and suppressing farmers from demanding the return of deposits. Therefore, the deposit return work of the branch could not be carried out.
    After discovering this situation, the township cadres immediately convened a mass meeting to mobilize the masses to speak out about their grievances. However, the farmers were afraid to speak, just looking at each other. The cadres repeatedly publicized the People's Government's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries to the farmers and immediately detained the lackey Zhang Junxian. Only then did the masses erupt in an uproar. Some proposed that Zhang Zhongsan's son still had three guns and should be detained immediately; others proposed that the cultural committee member Yang Yun should also be detained. The cadres immediately accepted the opinions of the masses. The masses' emotions became more激昂, and everyone exposed Zhang Zhongsan's crimes of killing thirteen people, raping women, and selling conscripts. The cadres represented the government in accepting the opinions of the masses, announcing on the spot that the counter-revolutionary bandit chief Zhang Zhongsan would be publicly tried, and deciding to cleanse Zhang Junxian and Yang Yun from the Farmers' Association and hand them over to the People's Court for strict handling.
    After this, the landlords were frightened and honestly returned the deposits to the farmers. Within one day, the deposit return work was completed. The masses happily said, "Only now have we truly been liberated."

　  绵阳石塘乡镇压了反革命
  　退押工作一天完成编辑同志：
    四川绵阳县九区石塘乡农会第四分会被反革命分子张仲三及其爪牙篡夺了领导权，致使退押工作无法进行。经人民政府发动群众，将反革命分子清洗出农会，并予扣押交人民法庭法办后，该分会退押工作就飞速进展，很快完成任务。
    反革命分子张仲三，是国民党党员，反动会门“复兴会”的总舵把子和一贯道的头子。解放前，他曾任伪保长、伪治安大队长等职，杀人抢劫，强奸妇女，贩卖壮丁，无恶不作。该地将解放时，他又组织“反共救国军”，阴谋抗击我军。解放后，该匪又组织伪农会，并威胁农民选他为主任。他经常开会威胁群众不准和干部接近，并强迫农民入一贯道。入道的农民每人被迫缴道费两个银元。
    一九五○年七月，我县人民政府发现上述情形，即将张匪清洗出农会并予以扣押。张匪又指使其狗腿子张俊贤（富农）、伪城北镇镇长杨云（国民党党员、三青团支部书记）等混入农会，并篡夺了四分会的领导权，继续作恶，压制农民催收押金。因此，该分会退押工作无法开展。
    该乡干部发现这个情况后，即召开群众大会，发动群众诉苦。但是，农民都不敢说话，只是你看看我，我看看你。干部们就向农民们反复宣传人民政府镇压反革命的政策，并且立即将狗腿子张俊贤扣押。群众这才哗的一声嚷开了。有人提出张仲三儿子还有三支枪，要马上将他扣起才行；有人提出要将文化委员杨云也扣起来，干部们当即接受了群众的意见。群众情绪愈加激昂，大家揭发了张仲三杀害十三条人命和强奸妇女、贩卖壮丁等罪行。干部就代表政府接受群众意见，当场宣布将公审反革命匪首张仲三，并决定清洗张俊贤、杨云出农会，交人民法庭严办。
    在这以后，地主们害怕了，就老老实实向农民退押。一天内，退押工作全部完成。群众高兴地说：“这阵子我们才真正得到了解放。”
