Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th: According to TASS, Pravda published on the 11th a talk by Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council and recipient of the "International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples," to its Paris correspondent Zhukov, stating: "This lofty prize is not only awarded to me personally, but to all peace fighters, because the strength of the peace movement lies in the fact that it is a movement of the people. As a French patriot, I am proud that the Prize Committee has so highly valued the role played by the French people in the struggle for peace." Joliot-Curie continued: "My activities in the World Peace Council are a continuation of the struggle against Nazism waged by my colleagues and myself during the war. Soviet scientists have already made many contributions to the prosperity of peaceful science and the happiness of mankind. We need to wage a tenacious struggle until scientists in all countries can work as freely as Soviet scientists, without having to worry about the future of their inventions. The conferment of the "International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples" is a vivid symbol of the close international ties of peace fighters worldwide."

Joliot-Curie commented on the French government's unreasonable decision to persecute the World Peace Council, stating: This is a manifestation of the weakness of the reactionary forces. The French people fully understand that this is a measure leading to war and are actively fighting to demand that the government rescind this decision. We are advancing side by side, and no force can destroy the great peace movement.

　　约里奥—居里发表谈话
    斯大林和平奖金的颁发是全世界和平战士紧密的国际联系的象征
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于十一日刊载荣膺“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金的世界和平理事会主席约里奥——居里对该报驻巴黎记者朱可夫发表的谈话称：“这种崇高的奖金不只是赠给我自己，而且是赠给一切和平战士的，因为和平运动的力量就在于它是人民的运动。作为法国的爱国者，我对奖金委员会这样高度地估价法国人民在争取和平的斗争中所起的作用感到骄傲。”约里奥——居里继称：“我在世界和平理事会中的活动，是我的同业与我自己在战时进行的反对纳粹主义的斗争的继续。苏联科学家对和平科学的昌盛和人类的幸福，已经作了很多的贡献。我们需要进行顽强的斗争，直到各国的科学家都能像苏联科学家那样自由地工作，不必为他们的发明的前途感到忧惧时为止。“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金的颁发，就是全世界和平战士紧密的国际联系的活生生的象征”。
    约里奥——居里评论法国政府迫害世界和平理事会的无理决定称：这是反动势力脆弱的表现。法国人民完全了解这是导向战争的措施，正积极为要求政府撤消这一决定而斗争。我们正在并肩前进，没有任何力量可以破坏伟大的和平运动。
