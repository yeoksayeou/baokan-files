　　Comic Strips Can Be Used as Teaching Materials
　　——Letter from Wei Sheng, Teacher at the Third Complete Primary School of Anyang City, Pingyuan Province

To the Editor:
　　Recently, we read the comic strips serialized in the People's Daily, such as "China, Korea, and Hungary Embrace Together" (by Huang Jing) and "Workers of Shijingshan Power Plant Capture Special Agents" (by Lao Ding and Chen Jinyan). We all believe that more comics like these should be published in the future. Firstly, these works are simple, popular, and easy to understand, and they are also interesting to read. For example, many people with lower levels of education say, "In the past, the People's Daily was not easy to read. Now that there are comic strips, people with our low education level can also read it." Secondly, these works have great educational power. As a primary school teacher, I have used these comic strips as teaching materials for my students, and they all enjoy listening to them very much. Some were even moved to tears by the stories in the paintings. Therefore, everyone unanimously expressed: "We must resolutely study hard, do a good job in propaganda, actively respond to all calls from the motherland, and resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country." Currently, this slogan has become the actual action of the students. For example, recently, in laboring to build the school and propagandizing the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the students not only completed the tasks but also performed very well.
　　From the above examples, it is sufficient to illustrate that the educational role of comic strips is extremely great—especially for people with lower levels of education and primary school students. Therefore, we very much hope that the People's Daily can frequently and continuously publish such works.

　　Editor's Note: We will definitely publish more comic strips and cartoons in the future to meet the needs of our readers.

### 连环画可作教材——平原省安阳市第三完全小学教师蔚生来信

　　连环画可作教材       
    ——平原省安阳市第三完全小学教师蔚生来信编辑同志：
    最近在人民日报上连载的《中国、朝鲜、匈牙利拥抱在一起》（黄景作）和《石景山发电厂工人捉特务》（劳丁、陈今言作）等连环画，我们看后都认为今后可以多登这类漫画。首先是这些作品浅显、通俗、易懂，读来也有兴趣。如好多文化水平较低的人都说：“过去人民日报不容易看，现在有连环画了，对咱文化水平低的人也能看看了。”其次是这些作品的教育力量很大。我是一个小学教师，我曾把这些连环画作为教材给学生讲，学生们都非常喜欢听。有的还被画上故事感动得哭了，所以大家都一致表示：“要坚决搞好学习，做好宣传，积极响应祖国的一切号召，抗美援朝保家卫国。”目前这口号已变成了学生们的实际行动，如最近学生们在劳动建校、宣传镇压反革命分子中，不仅完成了任务，而且表现得都十分好。
    从以上这些例子中看，都足以说明连环画的教育作用是极大的——尤其是对于文化水平较低的人和小学生们。所以，我们很希望人民日报能经常不断地登载这样的作品。
                                                    蔚生
    编者按：我们今后决多刊登连环画和漫画以满足读者的要求。
