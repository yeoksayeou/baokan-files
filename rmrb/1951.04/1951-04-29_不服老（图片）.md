    Unwilling to Admit Old Age

    (13) The more Old Man Li thought about it, the more anxious he became. He said, "The people of Korea who are suffering today are the very ones who saved Dachun back then. How can I rest easy if I don't go and help them!" Everyone was very moved by this, but they all said, "You're too old; we're afraid you won't be able to walk the distance."
    (14) As soon as Old Man Li heard this, he rushed out the door in a fit of anger. Everyone didn't know what was happening and followed him out. They saw him running eastward alone.
    (15) Old Man Li ran mile after mile. In his heart, he only thought about the suffering of the Korean people; about Doctor Cui, who gave Dachun a blood transfusion; about Dachun's letter encouraging the whole family; and about the detestable American imperialism. A fellow villager by the roadside asked him, "What are you running for?" But he didn't even bother to answer.

    （十三）李老头越想越着急。他说：“当年救大春的，就是今天受难的朝鲜人民。不去帮助他们，怎么能安心呢！”大家听了都很感动，但是都说：“你年纪大了，怕你跑不动路。”
    （十四）李老头一听这话，就怒气冲冲地跑出门去。大家不知道是怎么回事，都跟了出去。大家只见他一人向东奔去。
    （十五）李老头跑了一里又一里。他心里只想到朝鲜人民所受的苦难；想到给大春输血的崔大夫；想到大春来信对全家的鼓励；又想到美帝国主义的可恨。道旁有老乡问他：“干啥这么跑啊？”他也顾不上回答人家。
