    (12) Soon, all the mutual aid teams in the village became active; the cotton planting work was then enthusiastically launched.
    (13) At this time, some people shoveled away the dry soil and planted seeds in the moist soil, then dug moist soil from elsewhere to cover them; others used half dry seeds and half wet seeds, diagonally digging holes to sow, and the seedlings all emerged.
    (14) Wang Shan and his group, because they planted early, had already hoed the first time when others were sowing. It's just that the weather was too dry, and the seedlings were wrinkled, like rotten broad beans. Everyone was afraid that they would revert back to seed (meaning the seedlings would shrink).
    (15) Wang Shan hurriedly convened a meeting of the mutual aid team to discuss how to water and protect the seedlings. In order to preserve the moisture in the ground, they came up with a method of using a small iron rod to diagonally insert a few small holes next to the roots, and then using a kettle to irrigate the seedlings.

    （十二）全村各个互助组很快地都活跃起来；棉花播种工作随即热烈展开。
    （十三）这时候，有些人就把干土铲去，在湿土上点籽，再从别处挖湿土盖上；也有人用一半干籽，一半湿籽，斜挖坑撒点，都出了苗。
    （十四）王山他们这一组，因为种得早，别人播种时，他们已锄了头遍。只是天太旱，苗儿皱皱的，像个烂豆瓣。大家一瞧，害怕回了苗（苗又萎缩的意思）。
    （十五）王山急忙召集互助组开会，讨论如何浇水保苗。为了保住地中水分，他们就研究出用小铁棍在根旁斜插几个小孔眼，再用壶灌水的办法来浇水保苗。
