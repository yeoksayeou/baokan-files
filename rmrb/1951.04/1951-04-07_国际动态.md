  Florentine Workers Strike in Italy to Protest Government Persecution of Peace Fighters
    From 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM on March 30, workers in all factories in the province of Florence, Italy, held a half-hour general strike to strongly protest the Gasperi government's brutal oppression of the peace movement. Recently, the Italian government, frightened by the surging peace movement, has taken unprecedentedly barbaric means of persecution. It has been arresting peace fighters everywhere, and hundreds of peace fighters across the country are now undergoing illegal trials. However, as the Agenzia Telegrafica Italiana (ATI) said, this unscrupulous action by the Italian government can only "strengthen the anti-war movement." Under the strong protest of the people across the country, the government has had to release some of the peace fighters who were arrested for holding anti-war demonstrations when Eisenhower arrived in Rome.
  Cuban People Oppose Sending Troops to Korea

The aircraft carrier was carrying fighter planes and napalm bombs.
