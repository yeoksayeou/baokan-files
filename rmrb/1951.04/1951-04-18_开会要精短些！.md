    Meetings Should Be Shorter!
    Editor:
    After reading the two short commentaries in the People's Daily, "Write More Short Articles with Substance" and "Shorter, and Shorter Still," I feel compelled to say a few words.
    I spent four months working on production and disaster relief in the disaster area. "Disaster relief is like fighting a fire," and such work should be done with even greater urgency. However, I often feel that a lot of time is wasted, which is truly a pity. Especially meetings, some of which last for days. For example, when Su County in northern Anhui held a meeting to commend model workers, the model workers from Xiaqiao Township spent three days in meetings in the township, seven days in the district, and another seven days in the county. The model workers spent a full twenty days in meetings and traveling, and many complained, saying that they couldn't afford to waste so much time. Most of the people attending the meetings were illiterate, and the meetings were filled with one task and one arrangement after another, which confused them. By the time they returned from the meetings to convey the information to the masses, they remembered very little.
    Currently, a patriotic production emulation campaign is underway everywhere in the country, and everyone is very busy. Therefore, I suggest that all meetings and all speeches should not drag on; they should be streamlined and streamlined again!

### 开会要精短些！

专栏：来信摘要

    开会要精短些！编辑同志：
    最近读了人民日报上《多写有内容的短文章》和《短些，再短些》两篇短评，使我要说几句话。
    我在灾区做了四个月的生产救灾工作。“救灾如救火”，像这样的工作更应抓紧时间。但我常常感到有很多时间浪费得实在可惜。特别是开会，一开就是好几天。如皖北宿县开评模范大会时，夏桥乡的劳动模范在乡里开会开了三天，到区里开了七天，在县里又开了七天。劳动模范们连开会带走路，整整用了二十天，很多人叫苦，说误不起这样多的工夫。参加会议的人，多半不识字，会议中左一条任务，右一条布置，把他们头脑都搞晕了。等到开会回来向群众传达时，记得的实在不多。
    目前全国到处展开了爱国主义生产竞赛运动，大家都很忙。因此我建议：一切会议，一切演说，都不要拖拉时间，应该精简，再精简！
