Domestic Literary and Art Developments

The Soviet Propaganda Painting and Satirical Drawing Exhibition Closes

　　The Soviet Propaganda Painting and Satirical Drawing Exhibition held in Beijing has now closed, with a total of over 27,000 visitors. In the suggestion book at the venue, they fully expressed their love and welcome for this exhibition. They praised the greatness of the Soviet Union and the victory of socialism, and at the same time felt that they also saw the bright future of the motherland from these pictures. They believed that this exhibition gave them a good political education.

　　This exhibition strengthened the greater confidence of art workers. The All-China Federation of Art Workers specially held a symposium on April 24 to discuss how to learn from Soviet painters. The attendees included representatives from 17 art organizations and groups and artists in the city, a total of more than 40 people. The summarized opinions are as follows:

　　1. These works fully express the Soviet people's high spirit of patriotism, their respect for the leaders, and their love for labor production, and at the same time express their heroic struggle against the enemy; 2. They not only reflect reality, but also guide the people to transform reality and foresee the future. The works are closely integrated with policies and encourage the people to struggle; 3. The perfect unity of popularization and improvement. Popularization is not equal to shoddy work, and improvement is to create conditions for greater popularization, not formalistic "improvement"; 4. We should learn from Soviet artists how to promote national style, so as to fully promote the excellent traditions of Chinese art; 5. The authors are good at expressing typicality, and have a full sensitivity to things, which is mainly because the authors have a high degree of political accomplishment and rich life experience, and are good at learning from life.

《Wenyi Bao》Opens a 《New Prose》Column

　　《Wenyi Bao》recently opened a 《New Prose》column, publishing short articles of five or six hundred words to more than a thousand words. In the newly published Volume 4, Issue 1, there are several good literary and art short essays such as 《Suggestion for the Education Circle to Discuss the Biography of Wu Xun》 (Jiang Hua) and study notes on 《On Practice》 (Qi Xia), and also republished Mr. Lu Xun's discussion on Wu Xun and Comrade Hu Qiaomu's short essay 《Shorter, Shorter!》. This promotion of short articles is very necessary.

　　In addition, the criticism of the film 《The Biography of Wu Xun》 and Zheng Zhenduo's serialized thesis on China's great artistic heritage in this issue are also noteworthy articles.

Short Story Translations Exposing the American Way of Life

　　Recently, some literary and art publications have published some translated works describing the lives of the American people. These works unfold the picture of the American people's unemployment, poverty, and life of being harmed and oppressed, so that readers have a more concrete understanding of imperialist America; these works also have a "head-on blow" effect on some pro-American and pro-American thoughts. Among them, the following are worth recommending: two short stories by American writer Maltz (published in 《People's Literature》, Volume 3, Issue 6): 《The Circus Came to Town》 (translated by Shi Xianrong) writes about how American children do not have access to cultural entertainment, and how their labor is exploited by circus owners. 《The Happiest Man in the World》 (translated by Li Jue) writes about the American people's terror of unemployment and the terrible situation that the lives of working people are not guaranteed. The one-act play 《Please Be My Wife》, co-authored by Soviet writers De Henoveichnai and Slobedsky (translated by Me Xun, published in 《Beijing Literature and Art》, Volume 2, Issue 2), has a sharp satire and exposure of the freedom of marriage touted by American imperialism.

　　国内文艺动态
  苏联宣传画和讽刺画展览会闭幕
    在北京举行的苏联宣传画和讽刺画展览会现已闭幕，观众共两万七千余人。在会场的意见簿上，他们充分表示了对这个展览会的爱好和欢迎。他们赞美苏联的伟大、社会主义的胜利，同时觉得从这些图画中也看见了祖国的光明远景。他们认为这个展览会使他们受到了很好的政治教育。
    这个展览会对于美术工作者增强了更大的信心。中华全国美术工作者协会于四月二十四日特召开座谈会，讨论如何向苏联画家学习的问题。出席者包括本市十七个美术机关团体代表和美术家共四十余人。总结意见如下：
    一、这些作品充分表现了苏联人民的高度爱国主义精神，对领袖的崇敬，对劳动生产的热爱，同时表现了他们对敌人的英勇斗争；二、不仅反映现实，而且指导人民改造现实，预见未来，作品密切结合政策，鼓舞人民斗争；三、普及与提高的完美的统一，普及并不等于粗制滥造，提高是为了造成更能普及的条件，而不是形式主义的“提高”；四、我们应学习苏联艺术家如何发扬民族的风格，从而充分发扬中国艺术的优秀传统；五、作者善于表现典型，对事物具备着充分的敏感，这主要是作者具有高度的政治修养和丰富的生活体验，善于向生活学习。
  《文艺报》辟《新语丝》专栏
    《文艺报》最近特辟《新语丝》专栏，登载五六百字以至千余字的短文章。新出的四卷一期内，有《建议教育界讨论武训传》（江华）及学习《实践论》笔记（企霞）等好几篇文艺短论，并重新刊载了鲁迅先生谈武训和胡乔木同志所作《短些，再短些！》的短论。这种对短文的提倡是十分需要的。
    此外，该期内批评电影《武训传》和郑振铎论述中国伟大艺术遗产的连载论文，也是值得注意的文章。
  暴露美国生活方式的短篇翻译
    最近有些文艺刊物，刊载了一些描写美国人民生活的翻译作品。这些作品展开了美国人民失业、贫困、被残害欺压的生活图景，使读者对帝国主义的美国增多一些较具体的认识；这些作品并对某些崇美、亲美的思想有“当头棒喝”的作用。其中值得推荐的有美国作家马尔兹的两篇短篇小说（载《人民文学》三卷六期）：《马戏团到了镇上》（施咸荣译）写出了美国的儿童们如何的得不到文化娱乐的生活，以及他们的劳动力遭受到马戏团老板榨取的情形。《世界上最快乐的人》（李珏译）写出了美国人民的失业恐怖和劳动人民的生命得不到保障的可怕的情形。苏联作家得贺诺维赤奈和斯罗伯得斯奎合作的独幕剧《请做我的夫人吧》（么洵译，载《北京文艺》二卷二期）对美国帝国主义所标榜的婚姻自由有尖锐的讽刺和揭露。
