Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu of the Central People's Government Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement regarding the unreasonable seizure of the Yonghao vessel by the British government in Hong Kong, as follows:

　　The Yonghao oil tanker, which had just been repaired in Hong Kong and was awaiting orders to return to China, is under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Oil Tanker Company of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and is state property of the People's Republic of China. In mid-March, remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang in Taiwan colluded with the British-owned Huangpu Shipyard in Hong Kong to raise the issue of the Yonghao oil tanker's ownership in the Hong Kong court, attempting to seize the vessel. Minister Zhang Bojun of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government issued a statement on this matter, requesting the attention of the British government in Hong Kong. However, on April 7th, the British government in Hong Kong, falsely claiming it was for "public interest," announced the "requisition" of the oil tanker. On April 12th, more than two hundred fully armed British marine police forcibly boarded and occupied the vessel, rudely tearing down our national flag, coercing our crew to leave the ship, and then arbitrarily sailing the vessel away from Hong Kong. It is reported that the vessel "has been transferred to the British Navy." This unreasonable "requisition" of the Yonghao oil tanker by the British government in Hong Kong is clearly a blatant act of seizure of the state property of the People's Republic of China.

　　According to a Reuters London dispatch on April 13th, British Colonial Secretary Griffiths shamelessly said in his public remarks that the reason for the Hong Kong British government's "requisition" of the Yonghao vessel was: "For the safety of the British and United Nations forces in Korea, the Yonghao oil tanker must not be allowed to return to China." In this way, the British government exposed its consistently duplicitous policy, revealing that its intention was to curry favor with the United States and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, by seizing the state property of the People's Republic of China. Griffiths also said: "For our own needs, the Hong Kong British government decided to requisition this oil tanker." This more powerfully proves that the British government's real purpose is to seize the state property of the People's Republic of China to serve the aggressive and war policies of the United States and Britain.

　　The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the British government's unreasonable seizure of the Yonghao oil tanker is an openly provocative act against the People's Republic of China. Therefore, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China lodges a serious protest with the British government and solemnly declares that the British government shall bear all the consequences arising from this provocative act.

　　我外交部章汉夫副部长发表声明
    抗议英国政府劫夺我永灏轮
    指出英政府应对其公开挑衅行动承担一切后果
    【新华社十八日讯】中央人民政府外交部章汉夫副部长为永灏轮被香港英国政府无理劫夺事发表声明如下：
    甫在香港修理完毕并正在待命驶返中国的永灏油轮，属于中华人民共和国中央人民政府交通部上海油轮公司管辖，为中华人民共和国的国家财产。在三月中，台湾国民党残余匪帮曾勾结香港英商黄埔船厂，向香港法院提出永灏油轮的产权问题，妄图劫夺该轮，我中央人民政府交通部章伯钧部长曾为此事发表声明，提请香港英国政府注意。乃至四月七日，香港英国政府竟妄称为了“公众利益”，宣布将该油轮加以“征用”。四月十二日，为数达二百余名的全副武装的英国水警，更以武力强行登占该轮，无礼地扯下我国国旗，胁迫我国船员离船，然后将该轮擅行驶离香港。据报，该轮“业已被移交给英国海军”。香港英国政府这种无理“征用”永灏油轮的行为，显然是对于中华人民共和国国家财产之明目张胆的劫夺。
    据四月十三日路透社伦敦电讯的报道，英国殖民地大臣葛里菲斯在他的公开谈话中，竟无耻地说香港英国政府“征用”永灏轮的理由是：“为了在朝鲜的英国的及联合国的军队的安全，决不能让永灏油轮驶回中国去。”这样，英国政府就自己揭破了它一贯耍弄着的两面政策，暴露了它的企图原来是想以劫夺中华人民共和国的国家财产为手段，来向美国及其走狗蒋介石匪帮献媚。葛里菲斯又说：“为了我们自己的需要，香港英国政府决定征用这艘油轮。”这就更加有力地证明了英国政府的真正目的，是把中华人民共和国的国家财产劫夺了去，为美英的侵略政策和战争政策服务。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为：英国政府这次无理劫夺永灏油轮的行动，是一种对于中华人民共和国的公开挑衅的行动。为此，中华人民共和国中央人民政府特向英国政府提出严重抗议，并且郑重声明：由于英国政府这一挑衅行动所引起的一切后果，应由英国政府承担。
