Following the issuance of the "Circular on Responding to the Resolution of the World Peace Council and Universally and Deeply Promoting the Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Throughout the Country" by this Association on March 14th, the leading organs of the three major administrative regions of Northeast, East China, and Northwest have formulated plans to popularize the movement to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Wuhan City in the Central South region has also made some arrangements. The following is a summary of these plans for reference by the leading organs and people's organizations in areas that have not yet formulated plans.

            Northeast

    In order to respond to the call of the General Association on March 14th, the Northeast Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression (hereinafter referred to as the Northeast Branch of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea) was officially established on March 21st. Gao Chongmin is the chairman of the association. The inaugural meeting adopted the "Circular on Responding to the Resolution of the World Peace Council and Universally and Deeply Promoting the Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in the Entire Northeast Region." The circular suggested to all people's organizations and the people of the Northeast: (1) All trade unions, the New Democratic Youth League, and other people's organizations in the Northeast should, in accordance with the spirit of the March 14th circular of the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, formulate plans in the near future to popularize and deepen the movement to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea this year. In the movement to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, it should be linked to responding to the resolution of the World Peace Council, opposing the United States' arming of Japan, and defending world peace. At the same time, it should be linked to the current specific tasks of various localities. (2) It is recommended that people's congresses at all levels in the Northeast discuss and adopt plans to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea within their respective jurisdictions at their most recent meetings. (3) In the first half of April, reporters should be universally organized to give reports to urban and rural masses, cultivate and train propagandists, and strive to eliminate blank areas in propaganda work. In the second half of April, all cities and villages in the Northeast should convene small meetings as universally as possible to denounce the crimes of Japanese and American aggression and the crimes of Japanese and American running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents, in persecuting the people, hold signatures in support of the conclusion of a peace treaty, and hold votes against the United States arming Japan. (4) On May 1st, the people in urban and rural areas of the entire Northeast should hold large-scale demonstrations as universally as possible. In cities, all workers should be mobilized to participate, and urban residents should participate as much as possible. In rural areas, due to scattered residences, parades and demonstrations can be carried out by district. (5) All propaganda, education, and cultural institutions and public places in the Northeast should formulate propaganda plans for this year to meet the needs of popularizing and deepening the movement to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, oppose the arming of Japan, and defend world peace. (6) In order to systematically lead the movement to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, provinces, cities, localities, and counties should immediately start to jointly form a local association to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea by various people's organizations, and set up one or two people to carry out regular work, responsible for promoting the movement to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in the area, and introduce and exchange experiences.

            East China

    The leading organs of the East China Administrative Region recently instructed all localities: (1) To make further arrangements, strive to popularize and deepen the propaganda and education work of resisting U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, respond to the resolution of the World Peace Council, and prepare for the "May 1st" large-scale demonstration this year. All people's organizations, various propaganda, education, and cultural institutions, and various public places should also immediately, universally, and separately formulate propaganda plans. Those who have already formulated them should implement them immediately, and must realize the slogan of "making every place and every person in the country receive patriotic education to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea." In the plan, emphasis should be placed on eliminating blank areas in the propaganda work of resisting U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea before the end of April. In places where propaganda work has already been carried out, a permanent system should be established. Mass gatherings, denunciations, signatures, votes, and other activities in various places can be concentrated in late April. (2) Where parades and demonstrations with opposition to the United States arming Japan as the main content have not been held, preparations should be made to hold them; where parades and demonstrations with opposition to the United States arming Japan as the main content have already been held, other more appropriate methods can generally be adopted to deepen the propaganda and education work of resisting U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. However, the working class must still hold the "May 1st" large-scale demonstration. The instruction finally pointed out: All localities must seriously summarize the work experience of this period in order to promote it in a timely manner and further improve the mass movement to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

            Northwest

    The leading organs of the Northwest Administrative Region also recently instructed all localities to immediately formulate plans to launch the movement to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and earnestly implement them, ensuring that on "May 1st," the vast masses in urban and rural areas will take action after conducting sufficient propaganda and education. The main points of the instructions from the Northwest Regional Leading Organs are: (1) Conduct three days of current affairs study among all Communist Party members, government, people's organizations, and cadres working in rural areas, and also conduct a current affairs test to improve the political consciousness of party members and cadres. (2) Immediately establish reporters at all levels to give reports to factories, schools, and urban and rural people in a planned manner before "May 1st." During this period, implement the method of transmitting from top to bottom, level by level, and checking level by level, to go to various places to arrange the work of resisting U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, preparing for large-scale urban and rural demonstrations, and establishing propaganda networks. (3) Write the content of the circular of the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea into a propaganda outline suitable for various places, and tell the tens of thousands of cadres who are doing mass work in various rural areas to play an active propaganda role in this movement. (4) Adopt the methods of cities helping villages, organs and schools helping the masses, and superiors helping subordinates, and organize various kinds of propaganda groups, propaganda teams, and propaganda squads composed of various labor models of workers, youth, women, organs, large and small, as well as people who have been harmed by American imperialism, Japanese寇, and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, to conduct propaganda in the vast urban and rural masses, especially to carry out work in areas where the resistance to U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea is not deep. (5) Pay special attention to propaganda work in rural and ethnic minority areas, and pay attention to propaganda to workers in cities. (6) Due to the vastness of the Northwest region, in addition to convening demonstrations in major and medium-sized cities and densely populated areas, in other areas (even if there are only three or five households), meetings should also be held on the spot, but universality must be strived for. Cadres should participate in guiding these meetings as much as possible. The Northwest region will start in-depth propaganda from now on, and strive for more than 15 million people to participate in this movement. (7) In this work, establish local associations to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. This organization should strive to include people from all walks of life, and promote the patriotic propaganda movement of all walks of life through this organization.

            Wuhan City

    In response to the call of the General Association to "universally and deeply promote the movement to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea throughout the country," the Wuhan City Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea has specially hired reporters to give current affairs lectures, and divided the city into six propaganda districts, and the reporters will conduct lectures in various districts. The 83 reporters hired by the association, including the heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations in Wuhan City, have begun to go deep into factories, schools, streets, and alleys on the 24th to give lectures to the masses of various industries and strata. The central content of the lectures is to oppose the United States arming Japan and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. In addition to being responsible for organizing the masses to listen to the lectures, the sub-associations to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in various districts will inform the reporters of the ideological situation of the listeners and the general public in advance, so that they can combine the ideological situation of the masses and prepare their reports. Estimating that each reporter will give lectures to 1,000 listeners per week, more than 300,000 people can receive patriotic education to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea within a month.

    东北、华东等地制订抗美援朝具体计划
    自本会于三月十四日发出“为响应世界和平理事会决议并在全国普及深入抗美援朝运动的通告”后，东北、华东、西北三个大行政区的领导机关，已经订出普及抗美援朝运动的计划，中南区的武汉市也作了一些布置。现将这些计划摘要发表，以供尚未制订计划的各地区领导机关和各人民团体参考。
            东北
    为了响应总会三月十四日的号召，中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会东北总分会（简称中国人民抗美援朝委员会东北总分会）已于三月二十一日正式成立。高崇民为该会主席。成立大会通过了“为响应世界和平理事会决议并在东北全区普及深入抗美援朝运动的通告”。通告向东北各人民团体和全东北人民建议：（一）全东北各工会、新民主主义青年团以及其他人民团体均应根据抗美援朝总会三月十四日通告的精神，在最近分别制订在今年内普及和深入抗美援朝的计划。在抗美援朝运动中，应当联系到响应世界和平理事会的决议，反对美国武装日本，保卫世界和平，同时应联系到各地当前的具体任务。（二）建议东北各级人民代表会议在最近一次会议中，讨论和通过所属范围内抗美援朝的计划。（三）四月上半月，应普遍组织报告员向城乡群众作报告，培养训练宣传员，争取消灭宣传工作上的空白区。四月下半月，全东北各城市和乡村应尽可能地普遍召开小型的会议，控诉日美侵略罪行以及日美走狗蒋匪特务残害人民的罪行，举行拥护缔结和平公约的签名，举行反对美国武装日本的投票。（四）在五月一日，全东北城乡人民尽可能普遍举行大示威。在城市应动员全体工人参加，城市居民应尽量参加。在农村因居住分散，可以区为单位进行游行示威。（五）全东北各宣传教育文化机构以及公共场所均应制定今年内的宣传计划，来配合普及和深入抗美援朝、反对武装日本、保卫世界和平运动的需要。（六）为了有系统地领导抗美援朝运动，各省、市、地方和县应即着手由各人民团体联合组成某地抗美援朝会，设一、二人进行经常工作，负责推动该区抗美援朝运动，介绍与交流经验。
            华东
    华东大行政区领导机关最近已指示各地：（一）作进一步布置，力求普及和深入抗美援朝的宣传教育工作，响应世界和平理事会的决议和准备今年“五一”大示威，各人民团体、各种宣传教育文化机构、各种公共场所也应立即普遍地、分别地制定宣传计划。已订立者，应即实施，务必实现“使全国每一处、每一人都受到抗美援朝的爱国教育”的口号。在计划中，应着重于四月下旬以前，消灭抗美援朝宣传工作上的空白区。在已进行宣传工作的地方，应即建立起经常化的制度来。各地群众性的集会控诉、签名、投票等活动，则可集中在四月下旬举行。（二）凡未举行以反对美国武装日本为主要内容的游行示威的地方，应准备举行；凡已经以反对美国武装日本为主要内容举行过游行示威的地方，一般可采取其他更适当的方式，以深入抗美援朝宣传教育工作。但工人阶级仍须举行“五一”大示威。指示最后指出：各地必须认真总结这一时期的工作经验，以便及时推广，进一步提高抗美援朝的群众运动。
            西北
    西北大行政区领导机关最近也已指示各地立即订出展开抗美援朝运动的计划并切实执行，保证在“五一”这一天城乡的广大群众在进行充分的宣传教育之后行动起来。西北区领导机关指示的要点是：（一）在全体共产党员、政府、人民团体及下乡工作干部中进行三天时事学习，还可进行一次时事测验，借以提高党员、干部的政治觉悟。（二）立即建立各级报告员，“五一”前有计划地向工厂、学校及城乡人民作报告。在此期间，实行由上到下，按级传达，按级检查的办法，到各地去布置一次抗美援朝，准备城乡大示威及建立宣传网的工作。（三）把抗美援朝总会通告内容写成适合各地用的宣传大纲，告诉正在各地农村做群众工作的数万干部，使他们在这次运动中起积极的宣传作用。（四）采取城市帮助乡村，机关、学校帮助群众，上级帮助下级，组织各种各样的，大的、小的、工人、青年、妇女、机关各种劳动模范以及身受美帝国主义、日寇、蒋介石匪帮残害的人民组成的宣传小组、宣传团、宣传队，深入城乡广大群众中进行宣传，特别向抗美援朝未深入的地区进行工作。（五）特别注意乡村和少数民族地区的宣传工作，在城市要注意对工人的宣传。（六）由于西北地区辽阔，“五一”示威除在各大中城市及人口稠密地区召集进行外，在其他地区（即使是三、五户人家也好），亦应就地集会，但必须力求普遍。这些会议最好都有干部参加指导。西北区从现在深入宣传起，争取一千五百万以上群众参加到这一运动中来。（七）在这次工作中，把各地抗美援朝会成立起来。这个组织应力求包括各阶层人物在内，经过这一组织来推动各阶层爱国主义宣传运动。
            武汉市
    武汉市抗美援朝会为响应总会“在全国普及深入抗美援朝运动”的号召，已专门聘请报告员作时事讲演，并把全市分成六个宣传区，由报告员分区普遍进行讲演。该会聘请的八十三位报告员，包括武汉市各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人，他们已于二十四日开始深入各工厂、学校、街道、里弄，分别向各个不同行业、不同阶层的群众进行讲演。讲演的中心内容为反对美国武装日本和镇压反革命。各区抗美援朝支会除负责组织群众听讲外，事先并把听讲者和一般群众的思想情况告诉报告员，使他们能结合群众的思想情况，准备自己的报告。以每个报告员每周向一千个听众进行讲演估计，一个月内，就可以有三十余万群众受到抗美援朝的爱国教育。
