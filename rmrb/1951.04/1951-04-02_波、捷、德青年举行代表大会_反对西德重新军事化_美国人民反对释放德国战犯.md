Xinhua News Agency, March 31st dispatch: According to a report from the Electrical Communication Agency in Prague: From the 27th to the 28th, youth representatives from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Germany held a congress in Liberec, located in the northwestern Czech border, expressing their unified determination to oppose the remilitarization of West Germany. The chairman of the Free German Youth League, Honnecker, reported at the meeting that the remilitarization of West Germany is being intensified economically and militarily. West German employment agencies have virtually become recruitment stations. The West German people must contribute two months' income annually to maintain foreign troops. However, despite the terror tactics adopted by the occupying authorities, the movement of the West German people against remilitarization has expanded into a nationwide movement.

The secretary of the Czechoslovak Youth League, Vasik, guaranteed that the Czechoslovak youth will actively support the German youth's struggle against remilitarization. The secretary of the Polish Youth League, Jamczyk, pointed out that the peaceful border of the Oder and Neisse rivers has become the foundation for solid friendship and cooperation between the Polish and German people. West German youth representatives declared at the meeting: "When we must save our country from the horrors of war, national borders and ideological boundaries no longer exist."

The secretary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Tenny, congratulated the congress on behalf of 72 million members, stating that the holding of the congress demonstrates the great development achieved in the struggle of youth from various countries to defend peace. Youth in France and Belgium are holding similar gatherings in their own countries, and European youth are opposing the rearmament of West Germany and demanding the convening of a pan-European youth congress.

The congress passed a resolution calling for the convening of a pan-European youth congress. A mass demonstration was held after the meeting.
Xinhua News Agency, March 31st dispatch: The US policy of remilitarizing West Germany is increasingly arousing the indignation and opposition of the American people. According to a report from the Electrical Communication Agency: The West Coast Committee Against West German Re-Nazification in Los Angeles, California, published a booklet in mid-month titled "The Shadow of the Swastika," which fiercely criticized the re-Nazification and remilitarization of West Germany, and exposed the truth of the collusion between American and Nazi enterprises. The book wrote: "The re-Nazification and rearmament of West Germany is a dangerous threat to world peace and the freedom and security of the United States. Every American now has a responsibility to do their best to eliminate this threat."

Sybil Lancing of Indiana wrote in a state newspaper: We originally stipulated that the militarism of Germany and Japan should be destroyed forever. Now, we have released German war criminals, supposedly so that Krupp and his cronies can help us "defend" ourselves against the Russians. Where will this perfidy lead us?

In early February, a delegation of 200 women representatives from Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and other states went to Washington and told Truman and congressional leaders: "We were deeply astonished to hear Eisenhower say 'let bygones be bygones' to the German Nazis. Our mothers, wives, and sisters cannot forget that Nazi Germany massacred millions of people and deprived millions of people of their human dignity in the last war. We cannot allow our country's honor to be mixed with the executioners, who incited racial hatred, slaughtered children, built gas chambers, and formulated blueprints for the extermination of mankind. We ask you to promote peace and not to start a war." The delegation also demanded that Eisenhower stay in the country and let American youth live in peace at home.

According to a TASS report from Berlin: Many German youths are now writing letters to American youths, urging them to fight for peace.

　　波、捷、德青年举行代表大会        
    反对西德重新军事化 
    美国人民反对释放德国战犯
    【新华社三十一日讯】据电通社布拉格讯：二十七日至二十八日，波、捷、德三国青年在捷境西北部利培勒兹城举行代表大会，表明了他们一致反对西德重新军国主义化的决心。自由德国青年联盟主席昂纳克在会上报告称：西德重新军国主义化的工作，正在经济及军事方面加紧进行。西德的职业介绍所实际上已成为募兵站。西德人民每年必须以两个月的收入，充作维持外国军队的费用。但是，尽管占领当局采取恐怖手段，西德人民反对重新军国主义化的运动，已扩大成为全国规模的运动了。
    捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟书记瓦锡克，保证捷克斯洛伐克青年将积极支持德国青年反对重新军国主义化的斗争。波兰青年联盟书记詹齐克指出：奥得河与尼斯河的和平疆界，已成为波德两国人民间的巩固友谊与合作的基础。西德青年代表在会上宣称：“当我们必须拯救自己的国家免于战争的恐怖时，国土的界限和思想的界限就不再存在。”
    世界民主青年联盟书记特尼代表七千二百万盟员向大会致贺，并称：大会的举行表明了各国青年保卫和平的斗争已获得巨大的发展。法比两国的青年正在本国举行类似的集会，欧洲的青年们都反对重新武装西德并要求召开全欧青年代表大会。
    大会通过了号召举行全欧青年代表大会的决议。会后并举行了群众示威。
    【新华社三十一日讯】美国使西德重新军国主义化的政策，日渐引起美国人民的愤慨和反对。据电通社消息：加利福尼亚州洛杉矶的西岸反对西德重新纳粹化委员会，于本月中旬发行了一本题为“卍字的魔影”的小册子，激烈地批评使西德重新纳粹化和重新军国主义化，并揭露美国企业与纳粹企业勾结的真相。该书写道：“西德的重新纳粹化和重新武装，对于世界和平及美国的自由与安全都是一个危险的威胁，每个美国人现在都有责任为消除这种威胁而尽力。”
    印第安纳州的赛比尔·蓝辛在该州报纸上写道：我们本来规定要永远摧毁德国和日本的军国主义的，现在，我们却释放了德国的战犯，据说这样克虏伯及其同伙就可以帮助我们“保卫”自己以对付俄国人，这种背信弃义会使我们落到什么地步呢？
    在二月初，曾有美国康涅狄格、马萨诸塞、宾夕法尼亚、纽约、新泽西和其他各州的二百名妇女代表组成的代表团到华盛顿，向杜鲁门和国会领袖称：“听到艾森豪威尔对德国纳粹分子说，‘既往不究’，我们深感惊异。我们母亲、妻子和姊妹们不能忘记，纳粹德国在上次大战中屠杀了千百万人，剥夺了千百万人的人性尊严。我们不能听任祖国的荣誉与刽子手搅混在一起，他们煽动种族仇恨，屠杀儿童，建造毒气室，制订灭绝人类的蓝图。我们要求你们促进和平，而不要发动战争。”代表团并要求艾森豪威尔留在国内，和让美国青年安居国内。
    据塔斯社柏林消息：许多德国青年现在正在写信给美国青年，敦促他们为和平而斗争。
