Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editor:

On March 27th, your newspaper's "Letters from Readers" column published Wei Kuizhi and others' criticism of our office for not paying workers' wages according to the grain price standard. This criticism is basically correct. We are sending you the details of our handling of the matter and our self-criticism.

The Shanxi Provincial People's Government Labor Bureau's circular instructing public and private enterprises to pay wages according to the government's grain price evaluation was published in the Shanxi Daily on February 5th. However, because we usually do not pay attention to reading newspapers, we were completely unaware of this matter. It was not until your newspaper criticized us that it caught our attention. We were indifferent to the Party newspaper and did not seriously study the government's wage policy, which led to the mistake. Now, in addition to sincerely accepting the criticism, we have retroactively paid all the wages previously issued to the workers, starting from February, in full accordance with the Labor Bureau's regulations.

Another reason for the workers' financial difficulties was: in December of last year, our office hired more than a dozen temporary workers, including Li Yong (also known as Li Fuyou), to work as unloaders due to work needs. At that time, they themselves elected Li Yong as the team leader, and Li Yong was responsible for all workers' work, life issues, and wage distribution. Later, as the workload gradually increased, Li Yong was also responsible for recruiting additional workers. By February of this year, the unloading work was completed, and all workers had to be dismissed. We had previously notified Li Yong, asked him to convey the message to the workers, and asked him to be responsible for settling the wages, and he took away more than 1.4 million yuan. Unexpectedly, Li Yong absconded with the money. This caused financial difficulties for other workers. Our self-criticism on this matter is: although Li Yong was initially elected as the team leader by the workers, we should not have entrusted him with the responsibility of distributing wages to the workers; later, when adding workers, we should not have allowed Li Yong to be responsible for recruitment outside. Although Li Yong did not show any obvious signs of withholding workers' wages during the work period, Li Yong had objectively become a small foreman. Although our work was heavy and we had few cadres, and there were many things we could not take care of, we always thought that this group of people were temporary workers, and we did not pay attention to their lives and education, which caused the workers to suffer undue losses. This is indeed a manifestation of our insufficient concern for the interests of the workers and a weak mass perspective. We will do our best to overcome these shortcomings in the future.

### 某工厂太原建设工程处已按工薪米价补发工人工资

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　某工厂太原建设工程处已按工薪米价补发工人工资
    编辑同志：
    三月二十七日贵报“读者来信”栏发表魏魁元等对本处不按工薪米价发给工人工资的批评，这个批评，基本上是正确的。兹将本处处理的经过及检讨寄上。
    山西省人民政府劳动局指示公私营企业一律按政府工薪米评价支付薪资的通报，是在二月五日的山西日报上刊登的。但因我们平日不留心阅读报纸，根本不知道这回事。一直到贵报对我们提出批评后，才引起我们的注意。我们对于党报漠不关心，对于政府的工资政策不认真研究，以致发生了错误。现在我们除诚恳接受批评外，已将以前所发给工人的工资，从二月份起按照劳动局规定全数补发。
    这次造成工人生活困难的另一原因是：去年十二月间，本处因工作需要雇用临时工人李勇（又名李富有）等十几人，到本处担任卸车工作。当时他们自己推选李勇为组长，所有工人工作、生活上的问题和领发工资等均由李勇负责。以后工作日渐繁忙，继续添用工人时也由李勇负责招雇，到今年二月间卸车工作结束，全部工人均须解雇。事前我们曾通知李勇，叫他转达各工友，并由他负责结算工资，领去一百四十余万元。不意李勇竟携款潜逃。这就造成其他工人生活上的困难。对这件事我们的检讨是：李勇最初虽系工人推选出来的组长，但我们不应将工人领发工资等事情交给他负责；以后增添工人时，更不应该由李勇在外负责招雇。在工作期间李勇虽无显著的克扣工人工资现象，但客观上李勇已形成小工头。我们工作虽较繁重，干部较少，有很多事照顾不到；但在我们思想上始终认为这批人是临时雇工，对他们的生活教育等均未予重视，以致使工人遭受不应有的损失。这的确是我们对于工人的利益关心不够，群众观点不强的表现。今后我们当极力克服这些缺点。
