　　Careless Supervision of Special Agents in Hetang Hou Township, Lingling: Revolutionary Cadres Fall Victim to Heinous Crime

Editor:
　　Since the incidents of counter-revolutionaries setting fire to the city, burning mountains, and poisoning people occurred in Lingling County, Hunan Province, the majority of cadres and people throughout the county have learned from this bloody lesson and increased their vigilance against counter-revolutionary activities. However, some individual cadres are still very apathetic towards counter-revolutionaries, leading to the incident of cadres in Hetang Hou Township being killed by a special agent who had already been arrested and detained.

　　On March 31st, the Hetang Hou Township People's Government in the Eighth District of Lingling County received a special agent captured by the township militia. Comrade Gao Cheng of the township government casually interrogated him, but without gaining any useful information, he untied the special agent and allowed him to wash his feet and eat in the kitchen. In the evening, the special agent was locked in a room opposite the dormitory of the township government cadres. Comrade Song Kairan, the leader of the Hetang Hou Township work team, returned to the township government at night and also interrogated the special agent, but still did not take the necessary measures for detention and surveillance, and locked him back in that room. Around 2:00 AM, when the comrades were all asleep, the special agent secretly opened the door, went to the kitchen, grabbed a kitchen knife, and climbed through the window of the township cadres' dormitory, striking Comrade Song Kairan on the head with the knife. After being injured, Song struggled and fired several shots, but none hit the special agent. The special agent then escaped through a door that had been opened beforehand. Afterwards, farmers and militia in various townships, upon hearing the news, conducted a rigorous search and finally caught the special agent in a haystack in Linxian Guan Township. We hope everyone will once again learn from this bloody lesson and must not be even slightly apathetic or careless towards counter-revolutionaries.

　　零陵荷塘后乡放松看管特务
    革命干部竟遭毒手编辑同志：
    湖南省零陵县自从发生反革命分子纵火烧城、烧山、放毒等事件后，全县干部、人民大都接受了这一血的教训，提高了对反革命活动的警惕。但仍有个别干部对反革命分子十分麻痹，以致造成荷塘后乡干部被已经捕押的特务所杀害的事件。
    零陵县第八区荷塘后乡人民政府在三月三十一日收到该乡民兵捕获的一个特务。乡政府高成同志随便审问了一下，没有问出什么结果，就将特务松绑，并让他到厨房里去洗脚、吃饭。晚上就把特务关在乡政府干部寝室对面的一间房子里。荷塘后乡工作组组长宋凯然同志，夜里回到乡政府，对该特务也审讯了一遍，但仍没有进行必要的拘押和看守，就又把他关到那间房里。夜间二时许，同志们都睡熟了，特务偷偷开门走出，到厨房里摸了把菜刀，从乡干部寝室的窗户钻进去，向宋凯然同志的头上砍了一刀。宋受伤后还挣扎着开了几枪，都没有打中特务。特务就从预先开好的门逃走了。事后，各乡农民和民兵闻讯严密搜查，才在林仙观乡一个稻草堆里把特务捉住。希望大家再次接受这一血的教训，对反革命分子万不能有丝毫的麻痹大意。
