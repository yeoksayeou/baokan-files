　　Promoting the Political Education Experience of the Tianjin Municipal Trade Union Council

The article "How the Political Education of the Tianjin Municipal Trade Union Council is Conducted," published in this newspaper today, is a good example of a typical case of trade unions conducting political education for workers. This experience is worth promoting.

Soon after the liberation of Tianjin, starting in September 1949, Tianjin municipal workers conducted political studies by attending large classes, running short-term training courses, and creating methods such as broadcast lectures and organizing listening groups. Not only has this never been interrupted and has continued to this day, but it has also maintained a listening audience of more than 4,000 people. This is a great achievement.

The political education of the Tianjin Municipal Trade Union Council has achieved great results. Due to the constant persistence of this political education, the political consciousness of the workers has been rapidly raised. Their work attitude and production achievements are very good, and they are full of enthusiasm. In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and in production competitions, they always stand at the forefront.

The reason why the political education of the Tianjin Municipal Trade Union Council can be sustained and achieve results is primarily because the Municipal Trade Union and the administrative side attach great importance to the political education of workers, stipulate certain study times and study systems, and are led by the responsible persons, who personally lecture and answer various questions raised in the study, persevering tirelessly. This is the determining factor that enables the municipal trade union's political education for workers to be carried out regularly and achieve results. Secondly, in carrying out political education work, the Municipal Trade Union constantly summarizes experience, improves teaching methods, checks learning effects, and enhances and maintains the learning enthusiasm of workers, so that workers develop the habit of learning. Moreover, based on the characteristics of the dispersed work and residence of municipal workers, they created the method of using broadcast lectures to conduct political education. This is an important condition to ensure that municipal workers can participate in learning universally and regularly. The experiences that the Tianjin Municipal Trade Union has explored in employee political study for more than a year are worth learning from in various places.

### 推广天津市政工会政治教育的经验

　　推广天津市政工会政治教育的经验
    本报今日发表的《天津市政工会的政治教育是怎样进行的》一文，是工会对工人进行政治教育的一个典型的好例子。这个经验是值得推广的。
    天津解放不久，即自一九四九年九月开始，天津市政工人通过上大课、办短期训练班，以及创造了广播讲课、组织收听组等办法进行政治学习。这中间不但从未中断，一直坚持到现在，而且保持有四千余人听课。这是一个很大的成绩。
    天津市政工会的政治教育是收到了很大的效果的。由于这种政治教育的经常坚持，工人的政治觉悟便迅速地提高起来。他们的工作态度和生产成绩都很好，情绪饱满，在抗美援朝和生产竞赛运动中间，他们总是站在最前列。
    天津市政工会的政治教育所以能够坚持和获得成绩的原因，首先是由于市政工会与行政方面对工人政治教育非常重视，规定了一定的学习时间和学习制度，而且是首长负责，亲自讲课与解答学习中所提出的各种问题，坚持不懈。这是使市政工会对工人的政治教育能够经常进行并获得成绩的决定因素。其次是市政工会在进行政治教育工作中，经常地总结经验，改进教学方法，检查学习效果，提高并保持工人的学习热情，使工人养成了学习的习惯。并且他们根据着市政工人工作、居住分散的特点，创造了用广播讲课进行政治教育的方法。这是保证市政职工普遍而且经常能够参加学习的一个重要条件。天津市政工会一年多以来在职工政治学习方面所摸索到的一些经验，是值得各地学习的。
