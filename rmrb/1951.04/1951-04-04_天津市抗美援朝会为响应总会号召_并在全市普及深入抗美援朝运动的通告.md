　　Editor's Note: The Tianjin Anti-American Aid Korea Association recently held its Second First Committee Meeting, discussed and approved a plan to popularize and deepen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement throughout the city. The following is the association's notice with this plan as its main content.

    The China People's Anti-American Aid Korea General Association recently called on the people of the whole country to respond to the resolution of the World Peace Council, and to popularize and deepen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement. We, the people of Tianjin, unanimously and warmly respond to this call from the General Association, support the resolution of the World Peace Council, popularize and deepen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement throughout the city, and actively prepare for the "May 1st" demonstration parade to welcome the arrival of a new high tide of Anti-American Aid Korea in the city.

    The Anti-American Aid Korea Movement in Tianjin has achieved great success in the past five months. Since last December, the scope of patriotic practical actions of people from all walks of life has been expanding, and many people who had not yet been involved in the movement have gradually participated. At the beginning of March this year, a city-wide Anti-American Aid Korea representative meeting was held with the participation of 2,255 representatives, carrying out a broad and powerful mobilization. After the meeting, people from all walks of life, all industries, and all regions held rallies, demonstrations, and accusations against the United States rearming Japan, formulated or supplemented their patriotic covenants, and further "implemented the Anti-American Aid Korea Movement into their actual lives." Recently, in conjunction with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the city is conducting universal publicity and education on preventing spies and counter-espionage. In the past five months, the masses have clearly distinguished between the enemy and ourselves ideologically, and patriotic enthusiasm has been stimulated, which has been very effective. The development of the Anti-American Aid Korea Movement has become the main driving force for promoting various tasks.

    However, the development of the movement is uneven. The places where it has already been launched are not popular enough, and some people have not yet received education on Anti-American Aid Korea, mainly including employees of small and medium-sized factories and shops and their families, itinerant vendors, and housewives. According to preliminary key sampling results: in some small factories, about one-third of the employees still do not have a clear understanding of Anti-American Aid Korea, and generally small and medium-sized factories have not systematically carried out publicity and education for their families. In some middle schools, 20% to 30% of teachers and staff are still indifferent to Anti-American Aid Korea. Among residents, those who have received Anti-American Aid Korea education, in some streets with the best work, are estimated to be no more than 90% at most; while in places where the work is poor, about 50% of the people have not yet received education. Compared with the standard put forward in the General Association's call that "every place and everyone in the country should receive this patriotic education and actively participate in this patriotic action," there is still a long way to go. Therefore, if we want to make the Anti-American Aid Korea Movement truly popular among everyone in the city, we still need to make serious efforts.

    In order to realize the specific requirements in the General Association's call, launch a more universal Anti-American Aid Korea patriotic movement throughout the city, so that every place and everyone is affected, creating a deeper patriotic upsurge, and lay the foundation for conducting regular current affairs and political education in the future among organized and unorganized masses in the city, the following suggestions are put forward to all groups, institutions, and people from all walks of life in the city:

    (1) Steps to popularize and deepen the movement: In late March and early April, in addition to continuing to vigorously carry out publicity and education on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, preparations should also be made for further popularizing and deepening the Anti-American Aid Korea Movement. All democratic parties, people's organizations, districts, factories and enterprises, schools, industries, streets, and cultural and educational institutions, public places, and anti-American aid Korea organizations at all levels in the city should first investigate the actual situation of anti-American aid Korea work in their own units, paying special attention to the actual effect of the work, the depth of anti-American aid Korea education received by every place and everyone, and the existing understanding, and also pay attention to studying the effective methods and methods in the past work, and keep abreast of the ideological dynamics of the masses. Then, based on this, formulate a specific plan for your unit to popularize and deepen the Anti-American Aid Korea Movement this year, report it to this association at each level, and carefully organize forces to implement it.

    In early and mid-April, a publicity campaign to oppose the United States arming Japan and support the declaration and resolution of the World Peace Council will be launched throughout the city. For employees, family members, and housewives of small and medium-sized enterprises where the work was poor in the past, popularization should be emphasized to strive to eliminate blank spots in the Anti-American Aid Korea Movement; for units where the work is relatively developed but focuses on surface activities, ideological education should be carried out in depth.

    In late April, small meetings will be held universally to accuse the crimes of Japan, the United States, Chiang Kai-shek, special agents, and all counter-revolutionary elements, and to hold signatures to support the conclusion of a peace treaty and votes against the United States arming Japan and concluding a comprehensive and fair peace treaty with Japan (signatures and votes can be done by raising hands). Those who have not signed a patriotic covenant can sign a covenant at the meeting, and those who have signed it can supplement it and check the implementation. At the same time, prepare for the "May 1st" demonstration parade.

    On "May 1st," a city-wide demonstration will be held with anti-American aid Korea, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, opposition to the United States arming Japan, and defense of world peace as the main contents of the demonstration. Organize workers, students, industrialists and businessmen, professors, engineers, doctors, religious circles, and people from all walks of life throughout the city to participate universally.

    (2) In order to popularize the Anti-American Aid Korea Movement, all parties must organize and use forces well, and conduct publicity to unorganized masses through organized masses. In addition to the people's organizations, districts, industries, and institutions convening representative meetings to discuss and formulate plans, mobilizing and implementing them at each level, there are more than 90,000 students in workers' spare time schools and more than 200,000 students in large, medium and small schools in the city. Organizing teachers to explain to students, and students to publicize to the workers, family members, parents, relatives, etc. around them is a great force; in addition, various organs, groups, factories, and schools organize small-scale propaganda teams to go to various small and medium-sized factories and workshops and street residents to carry out publicity under the principle of not hindering production, district citizen propaganda groups and other activists, and conduct door-to-door visits to the streets and alleys. In this way, mobilizing the organized masses throughout the city to participate in publicity and education work in a vertical and horizontal manner, striving to make it known to every household and without exception.

    At the same time, pay attention to discovering and cultivating backbones in the popularization, expand and improve anti-American aid Korea associations at all levels, fix and regularize anti-American aid Korea representative meetings at all levels, consolidate the already organized ones, and gradually organize the unorganized ones, and on this basis, make the movement more popular and deeper.

    (3) The Anti-American Aid Korea Movement should be combined with practical work and current tasks. For example, in enterprises, patriotic covenants are generally established, production competitions are launched, and the movement to challenge the Ma Hengchang group is promoted. In schools, patriotic education is strengthened through political classes, parent seminars or family visits are held, and in conjunction with spring break, publicity to farmers is carried out in rural areas. Resolutely implement the four guarantees of the business community. Actively carry out and promote the self-reliance and reform movement in religious circles. Make the Anti-American Aid Korea Movement a constant driving force for all work.

    (4) In the popularization and deepening of the Anti-American Aid Korea patriotic movement, various effective methods can be adopted. For example, conducting visits, holding small-scale seminars and speeches, recalling and comparing past and present lives, accusing the crimes of Japan, the United States, Chiang Kai-shek, and special agents, holding various competitions and exhibitions centered on anti-American aid Korea, decorating shop windows, and singing dramas, quyi, and songs of anti-American aid Korea, and praising model deeds of anti-American aid Korea, can be widely used. At the same time, pay attention to collecting various data, and summarize and promote experience in a timely manner.

### 天津市抗美援朝会为响应总会号召  并在全市普及深入抗美援朝运动的通告

　　天津市抗美援朝会为响应总会号召       
    并在全市普及深入抗美援朝运动的通告
    编者按：天津市抗美援朝会于日前举行第二届第一次委员会议，讨论并通过了在全市普及与深入抗美援朝运动的计划。以下便是该会以此计划为主要内容的通告。
    中国人民抗美援朝总会最近号召全国人民响应世界和平理事会的决议，并普及深入抗美援朝运动。我们天津市人民一致热烈响应总会这一号召，支持和平理事会的决议，在全市普及与深入抗美援朝运动，并积极准备“五一”示威大游行，以迎接全市抗美援朝新高潮的到来。
    天津市的抗美援朝运动，五个月来已获得了很大的成效。去年十二月后，各阶层人民的爱国实际行动范围日益扩大，许多尚未卷入运动的人亦陆续参加。今年三月初召开了二千二百五十五名代表参加的全市抗美援朝代表会议，进行了一次广泛而强有力的动员。会后各阶层、各行业、各地区纷纷举行反对美国重新武装日本的集会、示威和控诉，订立或补充了自己的爱国公约，进一步“把抗美援朝运动贯彻到实际生活中去”。最近，结合镇压反革命，全市正进行普遍的防奸细反特务宣传教育。五个月来，在群众思想上划清了敌我界限、激励了爱国热情，效果是很显著的。抗美援朝运动的开展，已经成为推动各种工作的主要动力。
    但运动的开展是不平衡的。已经开展的地方还不够普及，有些人还没有受到抗美援朝的教育，其中主要是中小工厂商店的职工店员及其家属，流动商贩，家庭妇女等。根据初步重点抽查结果：有的小工厂还有三分之一左右的职工对抗美援朝认识不清，一般中小工厂对家属均未有计划地进行宣传教育。有的中学中教职员对抗美援朝漠不关心的还占百分之二十至三十。居民中已经受到抗美援朝教育的，在工作最好的某些街道，估计最多不过百分之九十；而在工作较差的地方，百分之五十左右的人尚未受到教育。我们的工作和总会号召中提出的“务使全国每一处每一人都受到这个爱国教育，都能积极参加这个爱国行动”的标准相较，还有很大距离。因此，要使抗美援朝运动真正普及到全市每一个人，就还需要我们继续作严重的努力。
    为了实现总会号召中的各项具体要求，在全市展开更加普遍的抗美援朝爱国运动，使每一处每一人均受影响，造成更加深入的爱国高潮，并在全市有组织和无组织群众中打下今后进行经常性的时事政治教育的基础，特向全市各团体、各机构和各界人民提出以下建议：
    （一）普及和深入运动的步骤：三月底、四月初除继续大力进行镇压反革命宣传教育外，同时为进一步普及和深入抗美援朝运动进行准备。各民主党派、人民团体、各区、各工厂企业、各学校、各行业、各街道以及各文教机构、公共场所和全市各级抗美援朝组织，首先要调查本单位抗美援朝工作的实际情况，特别注意工作的实际效果、注意每一处每一人所受到的抗美援朝教育的深度和现有认识，同时注意研究过去工作中著有成效的方式方法，并随时了解群众的思想动态。然后据以制订本单位在今年内普及和深入抗美援朝运动的具体计划，逐级上报本会；并认真组织力量加以执行。
    四月上旬及中旬，在全市普遍展开反对美国武装日本、拥护世界和平理事会宣言和决议的宣传工作。对于过去工作较差的中小企业职工、家属及家庭妇女等，应着重普及，争取消灭抗美援朝运动的空白点；对于工作较为开展而偏重表面活动的单位，则应深入进行思想教育。
    四月下旬，普遍召开小型会议，控诉日、美、蒋、特务及一切反革命分子的罪行，举行拥护缔结和平公约的签名和反对美国武装日本、缔结全面的公正的对日和约的投票（签名和投票可用举手方式）。没有签订爱国公约的可在会上签订公约，已签订的可加以补充并检查执行情况。同时做好“五一”示威大游行的准备工作。
    “五一”举行全市大示威，以抗美援朝、镇压反革命、反对美国武装日本、保卫世界和平为示威的主要内容。组织全市工人、学生、工商业家、教授、工程师、医师、宗教界以及各阶层群众普遍参加。
    （二）为普及抗美援朝运动，各方面要很好地组织和使用力量，通过有组织群众向无组织群众进行宣传。除各人民团体、各区、各行业、各机构分别召开代表会议，讨论和制订计划，逐级动员贯彻执行外，全市共有工人业余学校学生九万余人，大中小学校学生二十余万人，把教员们组织起来，通过教员向学生讲解，学生再向自己周围的职工、家属、家长、亲友等进行宣传，是一个很大的力量；此外，各机关、团体、工厂、学校分别组织小规模的宣传队，在不妨碍生产的原则下，分赴各中小工厂作坊和街道居民中进行宣传，各区市民宣传小组及其他积极分子，向本街本胡同进行挨户访问。这样纵横交叉地把全市有组织群众动员起来参加宣传教育工作，争取做到家喻户晓，无一例外。
    同时，在普及中注意发现和培养骨干，扩大和健全各级抗美援朝会，把各级抗美援朝代表会议固定化和经常化，使已有组织的更加巩固，没有组织的逐渐组织起来，在这样的基础上使运动更加普及更加深入。
    （三）抗美援朝运动应结合实际工作、联系当前任务。例如在企业中普遍订立爱国公约、展开生产竞赛、推行向马恒昌小组应战运动。在学校内，通过政治课加强爱国主义教育，举行家长座谈或家庭访问，及结合春假，在农村中进行对农民的宣传。切实贯彻工商界四项保证。积极展开与推行宗教界的自立革新运动等。使抗美援朝运动成为经常推动一切工作的动力。
    （四）在普及和深入抗美援朝爱国运动中，可采取各种有效方式。例如进行访问、举行小规模的座谈和讲演，回忆、比较过去和现在的生活，控诉日、美、蒋、特务的罪行，举办各种以抗美援朝为中心内容的竞赛和展览，商店装饰橱窗，以及演唱抗美援朝的戏剧、曲艺、歌曲，对抗美援朝模范事迹进行表扬等，均可广泛采用。同时注意收集各种数字，并及时总结和推广经验。
