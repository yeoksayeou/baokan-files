　　After Successfully Completing the Five-Year Plan, Soviet Industry Will Have New Development
　　This Year's Production of Machine Tool Manufacturing Industry Will Increase by 20% Compared with Last Year
    Xinhua News Agency, 18th: After the Soviet Union successfully completed its post-war Five-Year Plan, industrial construction this year will have new developments.
    During the post-war Five-Year Plan, Soviet machine tool manufacturing workers overfulfilled the plan by producing eleven times the special integrated machines, 19% of equipment, and 5.2% of metal-cutting machine tools. During the same period, the number of workers in the machine tool manufacturing industry increased by more than 50%. This year, the output of the machine tool manufacturing industry will increase by 20% compared to last year.
    The high development of the machinery manufacturing industry will greatly increase the number of mechanized enterprises. Among the enterprises that will be fully mechanized this year, open-pit mines will increase by 2.5 times, peat enterprises will increase by two times, iron ore mines will increase by more than 1.5 times, and timber harvesting enterprises will increase by one time. Some textile factories and other enterprises will be fully transferred to complex mechanized production. The level of mechanization in construction engineering, road construction, and loading and unloading work is also increasing.
    In the coal mining industry, the number of fully mechanized mines will increase fourfold this year. Mine No. 31 in Karaganda is an example of a fully mechanized mine. All coal mining, loading, and transporting work there is carried out using combined coal mining machines, coal cutting machines, and "Oriental" coal drills. The labor of miners has been reduced to simply managing the machines and mechanical devices. Mechanization has increased the average daily coal production by 1.5 times. Many workers who have been freed from strenuous labor have learned new professions and mastered the work of coal drill operators. After the coal miners in the Moscow Basin completed the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, by the end of last year, 99.8% of the coal mining work had been mechanized. Now the daily coal production has increased by 50% compared to five years ago.
    Stakhanovite workers and engineers in Soviet oil industry enterprises put forward more than 50,000 rationalization proposals last year, saving 200 million rubles. Most of these proposals have been widely applied in various oil fields, factories, and construction industries, and will have a significant impact on the increase in oil production.
    In terms of light industry, 440 light industry enterprises are currently being built and rebuilt in various Soviet states, and huge sums of money have also been allocated to expand and improve existing factories. This year, the output of cotton fabrics will increase by 21% compared to last year, silk fabrics will increase by 31%, boots and shoes will increase by 16%, and leather goods will increase by 28%.

　　胜利完成五年计划后苏联工业将有新发展
　  今年工作母机制造业产品将比去年增加百分之二十
    【新华社十八日讯】苏联胜利完成战后五年计划后，今年的工业建设将有新的发展。
    苏联工作母机制造工人在战后五年计划期间，超计划生产了十一倍的特别综合机器、百分之十九的器械，百分之五点二的切割金属母机。在同一时期，工作母机制造工业的工人人数增加了百分之五十以上。今年工作母机制造业的产品，将要比去年增加百分之二十。
    机器制造业的高度发展，将使机械化的企业数量大大增加。将在今年内完全机械化的企业中，露天采矿场要增加二点五倍，泥煤企业要增加两倍，铁矿砂矿场要增加一倍半以上，木材采伐企业要增加一倍。若干纺织工厂及其他企业将完全转入复杂的机械化生产。建筑工程、公路建筑、装运起卸工作的机械化水平也在提高着。
    在采煤工业方面，今年全部机械化的矿场将增加四倍。卡拉干达的第三十一号矿场是全部机械化矿场的一个范例。那里所有的采煤、装煤、运煤的工作都用联合采煤机、砍煤机和“东方”凿煤机进行，矿工的劳动已减轻到只要管理机器和机械装置就够了。机械化已使每日平均产煤量增加到一倍半。许多解除了费力的工作的工人，已学会新的专业，精通了凿煤机司机的工作。莫斯科盆地的煤矿工人提前完成战后五年计划之后，到去年年底，掘煤工作已有百分之九十九点八机械化了。现在每天的产煤量较五年前增加了百分之五十。
    苏联石油工业各企业的斯塔哈诺夫式工人及工程师，去年提出了五万多件合理化建议，节省了两亿卢布。这些建议大部分已在各油田、工厂和建筑业中普遍应用，对于石油的增产将有显著影响。
    在轻工业方面，目前苏联各州正在兴建和重建四百四十个轻工业企业，此外还拨出巨款扩充和改善原有的工厂。今年棉织品的产量将比去年增加百分之二十一、丝织品增加百分之三十一、靴鞋增加百分之十六、皮货增加百分之二十八。
