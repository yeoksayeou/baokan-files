　　Grain is Now in a Season of Heat and Rotting; Attention Must be Paid to Improving Public Grain Storage Methods
　　To the Editor:
　　Spring has arrived, and grain is most susceptible to heating and rotting during this period. Therefore, I would like to share some of my experiences in storing public grain in the warehouse for your reference.
　　(1) Pay attention to the cleanliness of the warehouse: The gaps in the walls and pillars of the granary are most likely to harbor pests. Therefore, a thorough cleaning should be carried out before the public grain is put into the warehouse. Insect nests, cracks, and rat holes should be filled with lime; bamboo cages for ventilation, grain bags, baskets, grain enclosures, and other utensils should be exposed to the sun and knocked clean; the warehouse walls should preferably be sprayed with disinfectant to kill insect eggs.
　　(2) The public grain entering the warehouse should be inspected. Grain contaminated with germs, pests, or moisture exceeding the prescribed standard must be exposed to the sun, winnowed, or treated with chemicals before it can be stored in the warehouse. Grain stored in the warehouse should be graded according to its newness, age, coarseness, and fineness. If the grain is piled in bulk, a ventilation bamboo cage should be set up in each square foot of area, with the upper mouth of the bamboo cage protruding five inches above the grain surface. The grain pile surface should be at least two feet away from the top of the warehouse, and the pile surface should be covered with bamboo mats, with two inches of plant ash placed on the mats to prevent insect pests. If it is a hoarding method, the height should be eight to twelve feet, and the hoarding opening diameter should be six to ten feet. Four to six bamboo cages should be erected inside the hoard, and then covered with bamboo mats and plant ash. If it is bagged grain, do not pile it too much or too tightly (each pile should not exceed twelve layers, and there should be more than one foot of space between each pile to allow ventilation), otherwise it is easy to heat up and breed insects.
　　(3) Adjustment of temperature and humidity in the warehouse: The warehouse should be inspected with a thermometer and hygrometer once or twice a week. Before the inspection, the temperature and humidity inside and outside the granary should be recorded; then, insert the thermometer and hygrometer into the four corners and the center of the grain pile, and after five to ten minutes, pull them out to observe and calculate the average temperature and humidity of the stored grain. If it is a pile of sacks, it should be inspected in three layers: top, middle, and bottom. If the temperature and humidity inside the warehouse are higher than outside the warehouse, the warehouse doors and air vents should be opened; otherwise, the doors and windows should be closed tightly. If the temperature inside the grain pile rises, time should be seized to carry out turning, winnowing, and other work.
　　When the warehouse is too humid, fifty to one hundred catties of quicklime can be placed in each thousand cubic feet of volume, divided into wide-mouthed pots to absorb moisture (the lime should be changed every two months). Grain warehouses without floors should be laid with a foot of fresh chaff (which must not contain insects) on the ground, covered with bamboo mats, and then the grain should be piled on top.
　　(4) The west and south sides of the warehouse are easily exposed to sunlight, which can easily increase the temperature inside the warehouse. Trees can be planted outside the warehouse or cool shade sheds can be built to prevent direct sunlight.

### 目前已到粮食发热霉烂季节  必须注意改进公粮保管方法

　　目前已到粮食发热霉烂季节
　  必须注意改进公粮保管方法编辑同志：
    春暖已到，粮食在此期间最容易发热霉烂。因此我愿意将我库保管公粮的几点经验介绍给大家参考。
    （一）要注意仓库的清洁：粮库墙柱缝隙，最容易为害虫潜伏，故在公粮入仓前应进行彻底打扫，虫巢、裂隙及鼠洞都应该用石灰填补；通气用的竹笼、装粮麻袋、箩筐、谷围等用具均应经太阳曝晒，敲打干净；仓壁最好喷射消毒药液，杀死虫卵。
    （二）对入仓的公粮，应加以检验。粘有病菌、害虫及含水份超过规定标准者，必须经过曝晒、车扇或用药剂处理后，才能装仓。装仓粮食应按新、陈及粗细程度分级储存。如果将粮食堆成散堆，在每平方尺的面积内，应设通气竹笼一个，竹笼上口以露出粮面五寸为宜。粮堆面至少要距仓顶二尺远，堆面覆盖竹席，席上放置草木灰二寸厚，以隔虫患。如系囤积法，其高度以八尺至十二尺，囤口直径六尺至十尺为宜。囤内应竖竹笼四至六个，再以竹席及草木灰覆盖。如系袋装粮食，则不要堆得太多太紧（每堆不应超过十二层，每堆间应有一尺多的空隙，以便通气），否则容易发热生虫。
    （三）仓内温度湿度的调节：仓库每周应用温度表和湿度表检验一至二次。检验前，应将粮仓内外温度、湿度记下来；然后在粮堆四角及中央五个部位，插入温度表和湿度表，经过五至十分钟，拔出观察，计算出存粮的平均温度和湿度。如果是麻袋堆集的，则应分上中下三层验查。如果仓内温、湿度比仓外高，应开放仓门、风洞；反之则紧闭门窗。如粮堆内温度升高，则应抓紧时间进行翻仓、车扇等工作。
    仓内太潮时，可在每一千立方尺的容积处，放生石灰五十至一百斤，分开装在广口钵内吸湿（每两月应换灰一次）。没有地板的粮仓，应在地面铺上新鲜糠壳（决不能带有虫）一尺厚，上盖以竹席后再堆放粮食。
    （四）仓库西、南两面，因为受日光照射，很容易使仓内温度增高，可在仓外植树或搭凉荫棚，以免日光直射。
