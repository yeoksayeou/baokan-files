　　Formalist Tendencies in the Establishment of Propaganda Networks in Northeastern Rural Areas Should Be Corrected
    Cui Ying
    Currently, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, rural areas in Northeast China are establishing and rectifying propaganda networks in accordance with the decisions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee regarding the establishment of propaganda networks. Generally, localities have adopted a serious and conscientious attitude in carrying out this work, and thus have achieved some results. However, some local Party organizations, due to a lack of in-depth study of the above decisions, have developed formalist tendencies in the rectification and development of propagandists.

    First, some areas, without considering the specific circumstances of their regions and failing to effectively integrate the work with current central tasks, have not rectified and established propaganda networks in a step-by-step and focused manner. Instead, they are eager for quick results, treating the establishment of propaganda networks as a crash task, resulting in formalist tendencies. For example, in Ping'an District, Yanji County, Jilin Province, due to eagerness to develop new propagandists, the rectification of the existing propaganda network was neglected. Although eighty-seven propagandists were developed in fourteen villages across the district within half a month, the original propaganda network collapsed due to a lack of specific leadership and education, and the newly developed propagandists were ineffective. In Erqu District, Kaitong County, Heilongjiang Province, when the organizing committee member of the district Party committee experimented with establishing a propaganda network in one village, thirty-two propagandists were developed at once, including ten primary school students, which is completely inconsistent with the Central Committee's decision. Moreover, several branch committee members of the Erqu Village branch determined thirty-eight propagandists through a discussion in bed.

    Formalist phenomena also occurred in the selection of propagandists. Some places erroneously adopted methods such as "democratic election" and "self-nomination with public discussion" to select propagandists. For example, Li Village in Xinjin County, Liaodong Province, adopted the method of "democratic election" by the masses to develop propagandists. As a result, a former puppet Manchurian policeman was elected as a propagandist. The branch did not approve, and the masses were dissatisfied, saying, "What kind of person are we supposed to elect? It wasn't made clear beforehand." In other areas, elections were held in winter schools, with the masses shouting slogans to approve.

    After the establishment of propaganda networks, there was a lack of specific leadership and training for propagandists, and necessary systems (such as meeting and learning systems) were not established. As a result, propagandists lacked "capital" for propaganda and experienced frustration in their work. Propagandists in some areas had four fears: first, fear of an empty stomach (low education, few materials); second, fear of being used as cadres; third, fear of delaying work; and fourth, fear of being criticized for poor propaganda. These phenomena must attract the attention of leaders.

    In order to correct this formalist tendency, Party organizations at all levels should restudy the decisions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee regarding the establishment of propaganda networks, truly understand the spirit and essence of these decisions, and establish propaganda networks according to the specific circumstances of their regions. Comrade Gao Gang said: "Without studying the instructions and decisions of the higher authorities, we cannot steadily grasp the policies; without studying the situation below, we cannot discover new things." The establishment of propaganda networks is a new topic in Party building. Being eager for quick results will only backfire. Comrade Gao Gang's recent report is worth deeply comprehending. He said: "Rice should be eaten mouthful by mouthful, roads should be walked step by step, and things should be done one by one." The same is true for propaganda network work; we must first lay a good foundation and move forward steadily. Of course, if all conditions are already in place, but subjective efforts are insufficient, and we act timidly and cautiously, thus hindering the establishment of propaganda networks, this should also be overcome.

    Secondly, the key to overcoming formalism lies in strengthening the regular leadership of Party committees at all levels over the propaganda networks and effectively establishing various leadership systems. Party committees in all localities must, in accordance with the Central Committee's decision, convene regular meetings of propagandists, with responsible comrades giving reports on current affairs and current tasks, encouraging propagandists to discuss current propaganda work, and actively establishing rural transmission stations to train village propagandists. Usually, the branch should organize propagandists to study the "Propagandist's Handbook." As long as the leadership conscientiously establishes various systems and strengthens the leadership over propagandists, our work of establishing propaganda networks will develop normally.

　　东北农村建立宣传网中的形式主义偏向应纠正
    崔英
    目前东北各地农村在各级党委领导下，正在按照中共中央与中共中央东北局关于建立宣传网的决定，建立与整顿宣传网。各地在进行这一工作时，一般是采取了严肃认真的态度，因此在工作上收到了一定的效果。但也有部分地区的党组织，由于对以上的决定缺乏深刻研究，因而在整顿发展宣传员工作中，发生了形式主义的偏向。
    首先是有些地区不根据本地区具体情况，没有很好地结合当前中心任务，有步骤有重点地整顿并建立宣传网，而是急于求成，把建立宣传网的工作当作一种突击的任务，结果发生了形式主义偏向。例如吉林省延吉县平安区，因为急于发展新的宣传员，就忽视了对原有宣传网的整顿。全区十四个村，虽然在半月内发展了八十七名宣传员，但因缺乏具体领导和教育，结果，原有的宣传网因此垮台，新发展的没有发生作用。黑龙江省开通县二区区委组织委员在一村试验建立宣传网时，一下就发展了三十二名宣传员，其中就有十名是小学生，根本不符合中央的决定。又该区二村支部的几个支部委员，在炕头上一核计就确定了三十八名宣传员。
    在对宣传员的选拔上，同样发生了形式主义的现象，有的地方错误地采取“民主选举”、“自报公议”的方式来选拔宣传员。例如辽东省新金县的李家村发展宣传员，是采用群众“民主选举”的办法。结果选了一个伪满警察当宣传员，支部通不过，群众不满意，群众说：“倒是要选什么样的呢？事先又不讲明白。”还有的地区是在冬学里选举，群众呼口号通过。
    宣传网建立后，对宣传员又缺乏具体领导和培养教育，也没有建立起必要的制度（如会议、学习制度等）；因此宣传员没有宣传“资本”，在工作中发生了苦闷。有的地方的宣传员存在着四怕：一怕肚子空（文化低，材料少），二怕当干部用，三怕耽误工，四怕宣传不好受批评。这些现象必须引起领导上的注意。
    为了纠正这种形式主义偏向，各级党组织应该重新认真研究中共中央和中共中央东北局关于建立宣传网的决定，真正领会这些决定的精神与实质，并根据本地区具体情况建立宣传网。高岗同志说：“不研究上级的指示决定，就不能稳当地掌握政策；不研究下面的情况，就不能发现新鲜事物。”建立宣传网工作是党的建设的新课题，如急于求成，反而欲速不达。高岗同志最近的报告是值得深刻体会的，他说：“饭要一口一口地吃，路要一步一步地走，事情要一件一件地做。”宣传网工作也是一样，必须首先打下良好基础，稳步前进。当然如果各方面条件都已具备，而主观努力不够，小手小脚，瞻前顾后，因而使建立宣传网的工作，遭到不应有的阻碍，这也是应注意克服的。
    其次，克服形式主义的关键在于加强各级党委对宣传网的经常领导，并切实建立各种领导制度。各地党委必须按中央决定，召开宣传员的定期会议，由负责同志向宣传员作关于时事与当前任务的报告，启发宣传员讨论当前的宣传工作，积极建立农村传授站，向村的宣传员进行传授。平常则以支部为单位组织宣传员学习“宣传员手册”。只要领导上认真建立各种制度，加强对宣传员的领导，我们建立宣传网的工作就会正常发展起来的。（摘自东北日报）
