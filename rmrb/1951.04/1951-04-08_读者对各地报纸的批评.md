Readers' Criticism of Newspapers in Various Regions
    We have continuously received many letters and submissions from readers in various regions criticizing local newspapers. In order to absorb the opinions of the broad masses of readers and jointly improve the work of local newspapers, in addition to forwarding some of the submissions to the relevant newspapers for reference, we plan to select a portion for publication in this journal in the future. We hope that readers of newspapers in various regions will write to us about the more important issues they discover while reading the newspapers.
  
    A Correspondent Wrote Twenty-Seven Articles and Letters
    The Subei Daily Should Not Ignore Them
    I remember that the People's Daily, in its editorial "Strengthening the Connection Between Newspapers and the People" on April 23 last year, said: "...The newspaper editorial department itself must face the broad masses and face reality. It should maintain close contact with readers in all aspects, listen to the opinions of readers and the masses, and strengthen the organization and education of worker-peasant correspondents." However, since November 6th last year, we have written fifteen news articles, eight sketches, communications and short essays to the Subei Daily, in addition to four self-introduction letters and inquiry letters. However, the Subei Daily has always ignored them. Of course, our manuscripts may have many shortcomings, but the newspaper also has a responsibility to guide us and help us improve! This attitude of not valuing the manuscripts of correspondents is a serious manifestation of bureaucracy. I hope the Subei Daily will deeply examine their attitude towards correspondents and readers.

    The Lüda People's Daily Has Not Maintained a Serious and Responsible Attitude Towards Critical Submissions
    After the Lüda Cultural Troupe published a review in the Lüda People's Daily on November 3rd last year regarding the troupe's biased business guidelines and the existence of serious bureaucracy in its leadership style, we believed that the troupe's review was not thorough. In order to help the troupe thoroughly improve its leadership style, we wrote letters and called the reader service group of the Lüda People's Daily several times, expressing our opinions and hoping that the newspaper could urge and help the troupe make a more thorough review. At that time, they replied to us: "The newspaper also believes that the review is too perfunctory and sloppy. The Cultural Troupe actually has the problems you raised in your criticism. Let the Cultural Troupe re-examine deeply, and the newspaper can study it." But until the end of February, the Lüda Cultural Troupe had neither re-examined nor had the newspaper told us the results of the handling. We believe that the newspaper's careless working attitude should be reviewed, and we hope to urge the Lüda Cultural Troupe to further review its shortcomings.

### 读者对各地报纸的批评

　　读者对各地报纸的批评
    我们连续接到各地读者批评当地报纸的许多来信和来稿。为了吸收广大读者意见，共同改进各地报纸工作，我们除将来稿中的一部分转交有关报社参考外，今后拟选择一部分在本刊发表。希望各地报纸读者，把读报时所发现的较重要的问题写出寄给我们。
  一个通讯员写了二十七件稿和信  苏北日报不应一直不理睬
    记得去年四月二十三日的人民日报在《加强报纸与人民群众的联系》的社论中曾说：“……报纸编辑部本身必须面向广大群众，面向实际。它应该与各方面的读者保持密切的联系，倾听读者和人民群众的意见，加强对工农通讯员的组织、教育工作。”但是我们自去年十一月六日起，已给苏北日报写过十五篇新闻、八篇速写、通讯与短文，另外还有自我介绍信、询问信四封。可是，苏北日报一直置之不理。诚然，我们的稿子可能有很多缺点，但报社亦有责任来指导我们，帮助我们进步！这种对通讯员稿件不加重视的作风，是严重的官僚主义的表现。希望苏北日报深刻地检查他们对待通讯员和读者的态度。

  旅大人民日报对待批评稿件没有坚持严肃负责的态度
    旅大文工团关于该团业务方针有偏向、领导作风存在着严重的官僚主义的检讨，于去年十一月三日在旅大人民日报刊出后，我们认为该团的检讨是不深刻的。为了帮助该团彻底改进领导作风，我们曾数次写信和打电话给旅大人民日报读者服务组，提出我们的意见，希望该报能督促与帮助该团作出更深刻的检讨。当时他们曾对我们答复说：“报社也认为检讨太马虎了草，文工团实际上是存在着你们批评中所提出的问题，让文工团重新深刻检讨，报社可以研究一下。”但直到二月底，旅大文工团既未重新检讨，该报也没告诉我们处理的结果。我们认为该报这种草率从事的工作态度应加以检讨，并望督促旅大文工团进一步检讨其缺点。
