　　Political Power, Science, and the Power of the People Will Be the Main Factors in the Success of Harnessing the Huai River
　　Huang Yanpei
　　The People's Government has only been established for a year and a half, yet it has properly addressed, one by one, many things that countless people under previous governments over thousands of years wanted to do but didn't, or did but didn't succeed, or didn't do well. Harnessing the Huai River is one of these.

　　Harnessing the Huai River is a monumental task, and an extremely difficult one, related to the agricultural production of tens of thousands of square miles and the lives of tens of millions of people. Those who have tried to harness the Huai River in the past have never succeeded. This time, I dare to say with certainty: the People's Government will succeed.

　　Why am I so confident? Because the People's Government has three major characteristics that no past government possessed:

　　What are these three major characteristics?

　　First, the People's Government has unified political power, as well as a democratic centralism-based, rational and empathetic political style. Generally speaking, for any river, when the water rises, the upstream areas demand discharge, while the downstream areas oppose upstream discharge; when the water falls, the upstream areas demand storage, while the downstream areas oppose upstream storage. Of course, these are not very difficult problems to solve from a hydraulic engineering perspective. The problem is that people always think of themselves, without considering others. Both upstream and downstream parties think only of themselves, without considering the other. Even the upstream, midstream, and downstream parties all think only of themselves, without considering each other. The matter becomes greatly complicated. Past regimes were never unified. Even upstream and downstream areas had long formed enemy states in history. Scholars and engineers, despite proposing reasonable solutions, could not satisfy one side without dissatisfying the other. Ultimately, they could not obtain the complete agreement of both upstream and downstream, or even all three. Thus, plans were made but could not be implemented; efforts failed before completion; or successes were destroyed. This phenomenon is common in the history of large and small waterways, and the Huai River is no exception. It's not that the Huai River itself is untreatable, but the problem lies here, at least this problem is a fundamental obstacle.

　　Under the People's Government, these are no longer problems. The political power is unified. The mentality of only thinking of oneself does not exist, nor is it allowed to exist. The higher authorities are still unwilling to rigidly exercise their unified political power, but rather adopt democracy and consultation. Last year, when the initial mobilization for harnessing the Huai River began, the central authorities convened representatives from all relevant parties in the upstream, midstream, and downstream areas of the Huai River and engaged in earnest discussions. Under this approach, there will be no further problems.

　　Second, the People's Government is using the latest scientific methods to handle everything. While the grand principles of water conservancy projects remain unchanged, the methods of applying these principles are constantly evolving. The study of soil and hydrology due to water conservancy projects is now considered necessary and natural, but in the past, it was not given much attention, or even ignored. The benefits of rivers with flowing water and the benefits of lakes that store water are mutually beneficial. Old water control methods focused mostly on dikes and embankments, while flood storage projects, such as building reservoirs with manpower in recent times, did not seem to receive much attention at the time. In fact, the Jinghui Canal, opened two thousand years ago, was a mountain valley reservoir—I jokingly call the Jinghui Canal a pocket reservoir—and Dongting and Poyang Lakes are simply the two natural major reservoirs of the Yangtze River. This time, harnessing the Huai River, I hear, places special emphasis on flood storage projects. Reservoirs under construction on the upper reaches of the Ying and Ru rivers in Henan Province: Bai Sha between Dengfeng and Yuxian in the north; Shi Man Po in Wuyang County and Banqiao in Biyang County in the south, although not directly related to the Huai River system, are significantly related indirectly. In the midstream, Chengxi Lake, Jiangjia Lake, Chengdong Lake, and others near Huoqiu in northern Anhui are also under construction. When these flood storage projects in the upper and midstream are completed, they may fundamentally change the situation in the lower reaches of northern Jiangsu and greatly reduce the burden of arduous construction. In the history of harnessing the Huai River, this may represent a new and great contribution. Moreover, under the leadership of Soviet experts, there will be new modifications to the construction methods and materials for dike construction to strive for time and cost savings.

　　Third, the greatness of the people's power. The power of the people is the fundamental force behind all the People's Government's measures. In the year and a half since the establishment of the People's Government, the power of the people has been evident in many water conservancy projects. The People's Government is good at organizing and educating the masses. The average daily efficiency of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission's dike repair project in 1946 was 1.4 cubic meters, which increased to 3.9 cubic meters in 1949 after the masses were organized. Individual models achieved 17.0 cubic meters. Let me briefly cite a few facts: A breach occurred in the Grand Canal dike in Yangzhou. More than 300 people linked arms and used their bodies as temporary embankments to resist the flood for an hour until materials arrived and the situation turned from danger to safety. During the flood rescue work on the Yongding River in Gu'an County, Hebei Province, during the most dangerous moment, the masses voluntarily removed doors and dug up pots to make up for the shortage of stake materials. Wang Xiuying, a female dike patrol officer in Koutou Village, Wen'an County, inspected thousands of miles of dikes day and night, tirelessly. Before lamp oil was distributed, she used her own oil. She discovered a leak west of the village, used her body to block the leak, and called for the masses to gather and seal it within three hours. Chen Laosan, a Communist Party member in Xinzhuang, Luan River, held up a quilt, crawled into the hole, and the masses sealed the hole. He was dragged out and rescued, only to regain consciousness. During the spring repair of the Yellow River in 1949, when the situation was considered serious, all county leaders, county party secretaries, district and township cadres along the river led the masses and guarded the embankment. In times of tension, the Shandong Provincial Government, Jinan Municipal Government, each sub-bureau municipal party committee, and military region headquarters, troops, and general staff, totaling more than 17,000 people, fully participated, along with the public and students, totaling more than 200,000 people, forming a living dike, day and night, and waged a tenacious battle with the flood, lasting 40 days, finally preserving the entire dike without a breach. These are all documented in official documents.

　　There are too many such facts. The main thing is that under the People's Government, the people have long regarded the country's affairs as their own. With education and organization, when used in military affairs, they are invincible; when used in construction, they achieve every success. The performance in water conservancy projects is one aspect of many.

　　The Huai River harnessing project is still underway. I wish, and I am sure, it will succeed. When it is completed, analyzing the factors of its success, the three points listed above will definitely be recognized as the main factors.

　　Political power, science, and the power of the people combined will be irresistible.

　　政权、科学和人民力量将是治淮成功的主要因素
　　黄炎培
    人民政府成立到现在还只一年又半，把几千百年来很多很多人在历来政府之下，想搞说搞而没有搞，或搞了些而没有搞成或没有搞好，这些，在这短短的期间，靠人民政府之力，一件件好好搞起来了，治淮，就是这中间的一件。
    治淮是一件天大的大事，也是一件天大的难事，关系到几十万方里的农田生产，几千万人的身家性命，历来搞过治淮的，从没有搞好过，这一回，我敢于肯定地说：要给人民政府搞成功的了。
    我何以敢于这样说呢？因为人民政府有三大特点，为过去任何政府所没有备具的：
    什么是三大特点？
    第一、人民政府有统一的政权，还有民主集中制的，合理而且合情的政治作风。从一般情况说来，任何河道，水涨了，上游要求泄，下游反对上游泄；水落了，上游要求蓄，下游反对上游蓄；当然，在水利学上，这些都不是很难解决的问题。问题是在一般人总是替自己打算，而不照顾对方，上下游双方都是替自己打算，而不照顾对方，甚至上中下游三方都替自己打算，而不照顾对方。事大大麻烦了。过去的政权总是不统一的。甚至上下游相互间，在历史上早已构成了敌国，学者和工程师们尽管提出合理办法，满足了这一方，满足不了那一方，到底无法取得上下游双方，甚至上中下游三方的完全同意，于是计划好，无从下手，也有；功败垂成，也有；功成而被毁，也有；一部历史上大小水道一般是这种现象，淮水当然不能例外。不是淮水本身不可治，问题就在这上边，至少这问题是一种基本的障碍。
    人民政府之下，这些不成问题的了。政权是统一的。专替自己打算，这些心理，是不存在，也不允许存在的。而上级仍不愿硬性地行使他已经统一了的政权，还是采用民主，经过协商，去年初步发动治淮工作，中枢曾经召集淮水上中下游有关各方面代表，经过恳切的商讨，在这种作风之下，更不会有问题的了。
    第二、人民政府是采用最新的科学方法来处理一切的，治水工程上大原则当然不变，但把原则运用起来，这些方法日新月异了，因水利工程而研究到土壤，研究到水文，在现今认为必要的，且当然的，在过去是不很注意，或竟不注意的，利在流水的河与利在蓄水的湖，是相互为用的，旧的治水法，致力于堤防为多，而于蓄洪工程，如近今用人力来建造水库，当时似乎还没有大大地注意到。其实二千年前所开的泾惠渠等，就是山谷水库，——我戏称泾惠渠做袖珍水库，而洞庭、鄱阳两湖亦只是天然的长江两大水库是了。这回治淮，闻特别注重蓄洪工程。上游河南颍汝两水旁已在施工中的水库：北如登封，禹县间的白沙；南如舞阳县的石漫坡，泌阳县的板桥，虽都不属于淮水正系，但间接的关系很大；中游皖北霍邱附近的城西湖，姜家湖，城东湖等，亦在施工；这些上游中游的蓄洪工程，有一天告成的时候，或将使下游苏北基本上改变形势，大大减轻艰巨工事的负担，在一部治淮史上，也许会表现一种新的伟大贡献，而对于筑堤施工的方式和材料等，在苏联专家领导之下，闻亦将有新的修改，拿来争取时间和费用的紧缩。
    第三、人民力量的伟大。人民的力量，是人民政府一切措施的基本力量。在人民政府成立一年又半中间，人民力量表现在水利工程上，着实不少：人民政府是善于组织并教育群众的。黄河河务局修堤工程一九四六年每日平均效率一·四公方，群众经过了组织，一九四九年做到每日平均三·九公方。个人模范做到一七·○公方，我略举几桩事实：扬州运河堤有一决口，三百多群众肩背相连，以身作子埝，抵御洪水一小时之久，器材赶到，转危为安；河北固安县永定河抢险工作，在最险恶的时候，群众自动摘门拔锅，来补桩料的不足；文安县口头村女巡堤员王秀英签查千里堤，日夜不息，在未发灯油前，自己拿油。发现村西漏洞，以身堵口，呼叫群众集合，在三小时内堵实；滦河信庄共产党员陈老三顶起棉被，钻进洞中，群众堵好洞口，把他拖出来施救，才苏醒过来；一九四九年黄河春修，认为情势严重，沿河各县从县长、县委书记到区乡干部，一律带领群众，住守大堤，在紧张时候，山东省政府，济南市政府，各分局市委，以及军区司令部，部队，一般工作人员共一万七千多人，全体参加，连民众、学生统计二十多万人，组成了一道活的堤防，日日夜夜，和洪水展开顽强的搏斗，历时四十天，终于保全全堤，没有决口，这些，都见之于公文的。
    这些事实太多了。主要是人民政府之下，人民早把国家的事，当做自家的事，加以教育和组织，用之于军事，战无不胜；用之于建设，功无不成；水利工程上的表现，是多方面中间的一方面。
    治淮工程还在进行中。我祝颂，我也确信它一定成功。到大功告成的时候，分析它成功的因素，上列三点，定被公认为主要因素。
    政权、科学和人民力量结合起来，将是不可抗的。
