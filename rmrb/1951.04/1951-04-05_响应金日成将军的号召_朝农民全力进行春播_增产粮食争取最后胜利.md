    Korean Peasants Go All Out for Spring Planting
    Increasing Grain Production to Strive for Final Victory
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd] Under the leadership, assistance, and encouragement of the Korean Workers' Party and the government, the vast number of peasants in the Korean rear are enthusiastically responding to General Kim Il-sung's call and are going all out to carry out spring plowing and planting work in order to supply more grain to the country and the army and strive for the early victory of the war of liberation.

    To help farmers solve the difficulties of insufficient food and seeds, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Republic lent hundreds of tons of food and seeds to farmers in areas such as South Pyongan Province, Hwanghae Province, and Gangwon Province in late February and early March. The Central Committee of the Workers' Party and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry have sent large numbers of cadres to the countryside to help local Party organizations and People's Committees lead farmers to organize mutual aid teams to solve the difficulties of insufficient labor, livestock, and farm implements. Cadres from various agencies and organizations such as local Workers' Parties, People's Committees, Public Security Bureaus, Trade Unions, Women's Alliances, and Youth Leagues have widely organized spring plowing teams to go to the countryside to help the families of military personnel with spring plowing.

    General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, personally inspected rural areas in South Pyongan Province in mid-March, which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers. Tens of thousands of women have enthusiastically responded to General Kim Il-sung's call and are working hard to mobilize, replacing their husbands and sons who have gone to the front to carry out spring plowing and planting.

    Korean farmers are bringing into play their initiative and creativity to overcome the serious difficulties caused by the enemy and are achieving great success on the production front. The achievements of Daebu Village in Pyeongwon District, Pyeongwon County, South Pyongan Province in spring planting work are a good example. During the occupation by the US and Syngman Rhee bandit troops, many farmers in the village were massacred, and many farmhouses were destroyed or burned down. When the village was liberated, the manpower had been reduced by half, and the livestock had been reduced by 75%. However, after the farmers in the village discussed General Kim Il-sung's call and the government's plan to increase grain production in mid-March, they unanimously decided to expand the village's barley planting area from 12,000 pyeong last year to 18,000 pyeong, and decided to complete the sowing of spring wheat before March 25. All the men, women, and children in the village were immediately mobilized, and manpower and livestock were organized to implement mutual assistance. The farmers, regardless of the harassment of enemy aircraft, worked hard day and night, and finally overcame all difficulties and completed the spring wheat sowing plan on March 21, four days ahead of schedule.

    In Korea, countless villages are currently engaged in a vigorous spring plowing and planting work. The farmers deeply know that producing one more grain is equivalent to manufacturing one more bullet; the victory on the sowing front means the victory on the front line.

　　响应金日成将军的号召
    朝农民全力进行春播        
    增产粮食争取最后胜利
    【新华社平壤三日电】在朝鲜劳动党和政府的领导、帮助和鼓舞下，朝鲜后方的广大农民热烈地响应金日成将军的号召，正以全力进行春耕播种工作，以便把更多的粮食供给国家和军队，争取解放战争的早日胜利。
    共和国农林省为帮助农民解决食粮和种籽不足的困难，曾于二月底三月初以数百吨食粮和种籽贷与平安南道、黄海道、江原道等地区的农民。劳动党中央和农林省都派了大批干部下乡，帮助地方党的组织与人民委员会领导农民组织互助组，解决劳动力畜力和农具不足的困难。各地劳动党、人民委员会、内务署、职业同盟、妇女同盟、青年同盟等机关、团体的干部，广泛地组织了春耕队，下乡帮助军人家属进行春耕。
    朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军在三月中旬亲自视察平安南道各地农村，更大大地鼓舞了广大农民的生产积极性。数以万计的妇女都热烈响应金日成将军的号召，紧张地动员起来，代替上前线的丈夫和儿子进行春耕播种工作。
    朝鲜农民们正发挥积极性和创造性，克服敌人所造成的严重的困难，在生产战线上获得很大的成就。平安南道平原县平原区大夫村在春播工作中的成就，就是一个很好的例证。该村在美、李匪军侵占期间，有很多农民被屠杀、许多农舍被破坏或烧毁。该村解放时，该村人力减少了一半，畜力减少了百分之七十五。但该村农民在三月中旬讨论了金日成将军的号召和政府的增产粮食的计划以后，一致决定把该村的大麦播种面积从去年的一万二千坪扩大到一万八千坪，并决定在三月二十五日以前完成春麦的播种。全村的男女老少随即动员起来，人力畜力都组织起来实行互助。农民们不顾敌机的骚扰，日以继夜地紧张劳动，终于克服了一切困难，在三月二十一日，比原定日期提前四天，完成了春麦播种计划。
    在朝鲜，今天正有无数村庄在进行着热火朝天的春耕播种工作。农民们深切地知道：多生产一颗粮食就等于多制造一颗子弹；在播种战线上的胜利，就意味着前线的胜利。
