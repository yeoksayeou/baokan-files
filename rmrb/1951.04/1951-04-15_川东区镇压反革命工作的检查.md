　　Inspection of the Work of Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries in the Eastern Sichuan District
　　The Eastern Sichuan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

From late November of last year to the end of January this year, a number of special agent organizations were successively cracked down upon throughout the Eastern Sichuan area. At the same time, more than 4,800 counter-revolutionary cases were cleared up. The captured counter-revolutionaries have been dealt with differently according to their different circumstances. This has greatly reduced the counter-revolutionary arrogance and gradually reduced sabotage activities, thus promoting the rent reduction and deposit refund movement in the vast rural areas. Many farmers said, "The people's government has arrested these bullies and bandits, as if a stone has been removed from our hearts." When Wanxian publicly tried the evil bully and bandit leaders Tan Wei and Zhang Kuijue, farmers from Zhongxian and Liangshan traveled a long distance to participate in the public trial. They said, "We won't feel relieved to go back and reduce rents and refund deposits until we see these bad guys shot." After Fengdu County executed the counter-revolutionary Wu Jintang, Liangshan County executed Shi Tingxian and Shi Zhilu, and Changshou County executed Fan Fucang, nicknamed "West Mountain Demon King", the vast number of farmers were very satisfied. They happily said, "The people's government has killed such big shots, what else is there to be afraid of!" Those who had been harmed by special agents and bandits were even more excited, holding up pictures of Chairman Mao and saying, "You have avenged us!" The masses in the Xiyang area took dry food and went out to arrest special agents and bandits on their own initiative. This area, historically known for its many bandits, is now very peaceful, and there are no obstacles to travel in all directions. After the resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the counter-revolutionaries themselves also began to differentiate. After Fengjie County executed bandit leader Tang Zhili, more than 20 bandits who had originally adopted a wait-and-see attitude voluntarily surrendered to the people's government for registration. One hundred and twenty-three bandits in Wulong County also surrendered to the people's government and handed over a large number of guns. These facts all prove the correctness of the Central Committee's instructions on resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionary activities.

Eastern Sichuan District has achieved certain results in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and has reversed the tendency of "boundless leniency". However, this does not mean that our work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries has been done well. In fact, there are still many problems in this work. The most important of these is that some people still doubt our determination to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Farmers in Wanxian said to our working comrades, "When you first came, you were afraid that we wouldn't rise up, but now we are afraid that you won't continue to support us." In fact, in some areas, the most heinous counter-revolutionaries who should have been killed have not been completely killed, and therefore the activities of bandits, special agents, and especially reactionary secret societies in these areas are still quite rampant. They continue to spread rumors and engage in sabotage. The reason for this phenomenon is that some party members and cadres in our party still lack the determination to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Some people say, "I am not easily corruptible, but I am afraid of making mistakes by killing too many people." Some people say, "I'm afraid we've suppressed enough!" In other areas, the handling of counter-revolutionaries is not serious enough. These shortcomings should be corrected.

In order to continue to suppress counter-revolutionaries and vigorously support the mass movement of clearing out bandits, opposing bullies, reducing rents, and refunding deposits, which is developing in depth, and the land reform movement in some areas that is about to unfold, the Eastern Sichuan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to strengthen the education of the entire party in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, raise vigilance, lead the broad masses, and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries. In terms of leadership, when necessary, send cadres to areas where the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is weak to inspect and supervise. Secondly, in the process of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, attention should be paid to exposing the crimes of bandits and special agents and overcoming ideological obstacles within and outside the party. At the same time, the approval procedures for the execution of counter-revolutionaries should always be strictly observed.

### 川东区镇压反革命工作的检查

　　川东区镇压反革命工作的检查
    中共川东区党委
    四川川东全区，从去年十一月下旬至今年一月底，先后破获了一批特务组织。同时清理了四千八百余件反革命案件。对于捕获的反革命分子，已根据不同情况，进行了不同的处理。这就使反革命邪气大为下降，破坏活动逐渐减少，因此推动了广大农村的减租退押运动。有很多农民说：“人民政府把这些恶霸、土匪逮捕起来，就好像搬去咱们心里的一块石头。”万县公审恶霸匪首谭伟、张奎爵时，忠县、梁山的农民远道赶来参加公审大会。他们说：“不看见枪毙这些坏人，是不放心回去减租、退押的。”酆都县枪决了反革命分子吴锦堂，梁山县枪决了石廷贤、石治禄，长寿县枪决了绰号“西山魔王”的范福仓，广大农民十分满意。他们高兴地说：“这样大的头子，人民政府都杀了，还怕啥子！”曾经被特务土匪害过的人更加兴奋，捧着毛主席像说：“你可替我们报了仇啦！”西阳专区的群众带上干粮自动出外逮捕特务土匪。这个历史上被称为土匪众多的地区，现在社会秩序已非常安宁，东南西北畅行无阻。经过坚决镇压反革命后，反革命分子内部也开始分化。奉节县枪决匪首唐之礼后，原来抱观望态度的二十余名土匪，自动向人民政府投诚登记。武隆县一百二十三名土匪，也向人民政府投降了，并交出大批枪枝。这些事实，都证明了中央关于坚决镇压反革命活动的指示的正确。
    川东区在镇压反革命工作上，已取得了一定的成绩，扭转了“宽大无边”的倾向。但是，这并不是说我们镇压反革命的工作已作得很好，实际上，在这一工作中，还存在不少问题。其中最重要的是，有些群众还怀疑我们镇压反革命的决心。万县农民对我们的工作同志说：“你们初来时怕我们不起来，现在我们怕你们不给我们继续撑腰。”事实上有些地区，对应该杀的反革命的首恶分子并没有完全杀了，因而这些地区的土匪特务尤其是反动会道门的活动仍是相当猖獗，他们继续造谣、破坏。造成这种现象的原因，是由于在我们党内，有些党员干部还缺乏镇压反革命的决心，有些人就这样说：“我是不容易贪污腐化的，但怕杀多了犯错误。”有人这样说：“恐怕镇压得够了吧！”另有些地区处理反革命分子时还不够严肃。这些缺点，都是应当注意改正的。
    中共川东党委为了继续镇压反革命，有力地支援正在深入发展的清剿土匪、反恶霸、减租、退押的群众运动，与即将展开的部分地区的土地改革运动，决定在全党加强镇压反革命的教育，提高警惕性，领导广大群众，坚决镇压反革命。领导上，在必要时派干部到镇压反革命工作薄弱的地区去检查，督促。其次，在镇压反革命的过程中，应注意揭露土匪特务的罪恶，克服党内党外思想上的阻力。同时，应始终严格遵守处决反革命分子的批准手续。
