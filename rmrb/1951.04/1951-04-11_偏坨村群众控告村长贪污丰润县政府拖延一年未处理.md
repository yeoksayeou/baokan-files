To the Editor:

　　Our village chief, Wu Yuqing, and five others have engaged in embezzlement. After the masses discovered this, Wu Yuqing felt guilty and, upon request, was transferred to work at the District People's Government. The villagers sent representatives to the District People's Government to demand a settlement of accounts with Wu Yuqing for 1949. The representatives went several times but were refused by the district cadres. Everyone reported this matter to the Fengrun County People's Government. The County People's Government then approved the accounting with Wu Yuqing and sent people to the district to investigate. However, this matter has been delayed for a year now, and there is still no result. We hope that the Fengrun County People's Government can quickly handle this matter.

　　Zhang Shunting, Xu Duanming, and 57 others from Piantuo Village, Fengrun County, Hebei.

　　偏坨村群众控告村长贪污丰润县政府拖延一年未处理编辑同志：
    我村村长吴玉清等六人曾有贪污行为。经群众发觉后，吴玉清自觉心虚，经过要求，被调到区人民政府工作。全村群众派代表到区人民政府，要求和吴玉清清算一九四九年的账目。代表们去了几次，都被区干部拒绝。大家又把这事报告给丰润县人民政府。县人民政府当时就批准了和吴玉清算账，并派人到区上进行调查。但是这事到现在已拖延了一年，还无结果。我们希望丰润县人民政府能迅速处理此事。
