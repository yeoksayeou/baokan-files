Shenyang Women from All Walks of Life Combine with Practical Work to Establish Patriotic Pacts for Units and Individuals

Following the establishment of the city-wide women's patriotic pact on "March 8th" International Women's Day, women from 112 units in Shenyang have combined with their actual work to establish patriotic pacts for both units and individuals. Most of these units conducted repeated discussions when establishing the patriotic pacts; everyone carefully signed and sealed the collective pact when it was passed. After the pacts were passed, they were announced by the radio station. Women from all walks of life also challenged each other and urged each other to implement the pacts.

The pacts established by women from all walks of life can be combined with their work. Ma Yunqing and five other female workers in the Third Machine Factory's lathe workshop originally had a quota of 48 protective hand covers, number 49, in eight hours; they wrote in the pact: guarantee to complete 65 pieces in eight hours, requiring 100% to meet specifications. All the female comrades in the Fifth Machine Factory's clinic wrote in the pact: treat injured and sick employees with a kind attitude, not afraid of the dark or distance for deliveries, and guarantee the completion of tasks. All the women in Shenjingzi Village, Shenjingzi District in the suburbs, guaranteed to plant more industrial raw materials such as cotton and hemp, increase grain production by ten jin per mu, and strive to basically eliminate illiteracy by the end of the year. At a recent meeting of women representatives from the cultural and educational circles in Shenyang, 112 women representatives from the cultural and educational circles jointly formulated seven covenants, including strengthening patriotic education and enhancing national self-esteem. Workers' family members and housewives wrote in the patriotic pacts: manage household affairs well and encourage their husbands to work hard.

After women from all walks of life signed the patriotic pacts, various tasks have improved. Guo Suqin's team in a model workshop of a certain factory holds weekly meetings to check the implementation of the pact. Now the quality of their products has reached the point of completely eliminating defective products, and the quantity has increased by 70% compared to before the pact was signed. After the typists of the People's Planning and Economic Committee of the Northeast People's Government signed the pact, waste paper was reduced from 3% to 0.5%. After six female comrades in the Heping District People's Health Institute signed the pact, they used their spare time to conduct smallpox prevention publicity to more than 42,000 people in seven days. In the implementation of the patriotic pact, workers' families in a certain enterprise formed study classes and study groups according to their residential situation, and began to raise domestic rabbits, engage in sideline production, and assigned special personnel to check air defense, anti-espionage, fire prevention, and theft prevention work every day.

　　沈阳各界妇女结合实际工作
　  订立单位和个人的爱国公约
    沈阳市各界一百十二个单位的妇女继“三八”节订立全市妇女爱国公约之后，纷纷结合实际工作，订立了单位的和个人的爱国公约。这些单位在订立爱国公约时大多经过反复的讨论；在通过集体公约时，每个人都慎重地签字盖章。公约通过后再由广播电台公布。各界妇女并互相挑战，互相督促公约的实现。
    各界妇女所订的公约都能和本岗位的工作结合。第三机械厂车工部马云清等六名女工，原来做护手四十九号活的定额是八小时作四十八个；她们在公约中写着：保证八小时完成六十五个，要求百分之百都合乎规格。第五机械厂医务所全体女同志在公约中写着：对伤病员工要态度和蔼，接产不怕天黑路远，保证完成任务。市郊深井子区深井子村全村妇女保证多种棉、麻等工业原料，每亩地增产十斤粮，到年底争取基本上消灭文盲。沈阳市一百十二名文教界妇女代表在最近召开的文教界妇女代表会议上，共同拟订了加强爱国主义教育，提高民族自尊心等七项公约。工人家属及主妇们在爱国公约上写着：管好家务，鼓励丈夫安心生产。
    各界妇女在签订爱国公约后，各项工作都有了改进。某厂模范车间郭素琴小组，每周开会检查一次执行公约的情况，现在她们的产品质量已达到完全消灭废品，数量也较订约前增加了百分之七十。东北人民政府人民计划经济委员会的打字员订约后，废纸由百分之三降到千分之点五。和平区人民卫生院六名女同志订约后，在七天内，利用业余时间，共向四万二千余群众进行了预防天花的宣传。某企业的工人家属们在执行爱国公约中，按居住情况组成学习班及学习小组，并开始养家兔，搞副业生产，设专人每日检查防空、防特、防火、防盗等工作。
