China People's Anti-American Aid Korea General Association Notice
　　Sign in Support of Concluding a Peace Pact
　　Hold a Vote on the Japan Issue

　　In the "Circular on Responding to the World Peace Council Resolution and Popularizing and Deepening the Anti-American Aid Korea Movement Throughout the Country" issued by this association on March 14, it was suggested that small meetings be held as universally as possible in urban and rural areas across the country in late April. At these meetings, in addition to accusing the crimes of the Japanese and American aggressors and their running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents, signatures should be collected in support of concluding a peace pact, and a vote should be held on the Japan issue. The specific methods for signing and voting are now stipulated as follows:

　　A. Regarding signing in support of concluding a peace pact

　　(1) The signing in support of concluding a peace pact refers to signing on the "Declaration of the World Peace Council on Concluding a Peace Pact." The translated version of the declaration issued by the World Peace Council in February has been revised and broadcast by Xinhua News Agency on March 27. It is hoped that the leading organs of each province, major city, and administrative region will be responsible for reprinting it and distributing it throughout the region before the end of April.

　　(2) Before holding the signing, the person in charge of the local meeting should read this declaration and give a popular explanation to the attendees about the meaning of the declaration and the reasons for signing. The reason why we support the five major powers of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to conclude a peace pact is to show our opposition to wars of aggression and our adherence to peace and democracy; we need peace. If the United States, Britain, and France continue to oppose concluding a peace pact, it will prove that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have aggressive conspiracies, which will enable the people of the world to further recognize their true colors.

　　(3) Signing method: In government offices and schools, individual signing methods can be used. In rural areas, factories, and streets, the method of raising hands can be used instead at gatherings, that is, whoever is willing to sign the declaration raises their hand. The person in charge of the meeting should accurately calculate the number of signatures (raised hands) and report it to this association level by level.

　　B. Regarding the vote on the Japan issue

　　(1) The vote on the Japan issue refers to holding a national referendum on the content stipulated in the "Resolution on Solving the Japan Issue by Peaceful Means" passed by the World Peace Council in February.

　　The questions that need to be voted on are as follows:

　　1. Oppose the United States arming Japan and oppose the United States making a separate peace treaty with Japan.
　　2. Advocate signing a comprehensive armistice treaty to promote peace and democracy for the Japanese people.

　　(2) Before the voting, the person in charge of the local meeting should give a popular explanation to the attendees about the above two points and the reasons for voting, explaining that voting can express the determination to oppose the United States arming Japan and invading China.

　　(3) For the sake of simplicity, voting can be replaced by a show of hands, that is, whoever agrees with the above two points raises their hand. The person in charge of the meeting should accurately calculate the number of attendees and the number of people who raise their hands in agreement, and report it to this association level by level.

　　C. Those who have not held meetings in late April to sign and vote can hold a short meeting before the May 1st Labor Day parade and carry out the signing and voting in accordance with the above items A and B, and report it to this association level by level.
