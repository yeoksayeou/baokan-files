　  Shanghai Lingliang Middle School Teachers and Students Expose Special Agent Gu Ren'en's "Healing" Scam

To the Editor:
    Having read the news in the newspaper about the arrest of Gu Ren'en, a special agent disguised in religious clothing, by the People's Government, we—the teachers and students of Shanghai Lingliang Middle School—are very excited. Now we want to expose Gu Ren'en's "Divine Doctor Healing" scam in Shanghai to everyone.

    In January of this year, when Gu Ren'en was preaching at the Shanghai Lingliang Church, he falsely claimed that he had "participated in the Nanchang 'August 1st' Uprising," had "participated in the Political Consultative Conference," and was "about to go to the Soviet Union to preach at the invitation of a Soviet pastor." He also fabricated stories, saying: "When I was healing people in Hangzhou, many People's Liberation Army soldiers came to ask me to heal them. Their officers reprimanded them, but they showed their officers the fact that they had been healed, and the officers believed it too."

    Deceived by him, some patients sought him for treatment. When Gu Ren'en treated patients, he first smeared olive oil on the patient's head, and then prayed for them; the elders and deacons next to him would shout loudly: "Praise the Lord, thank the Lord, you are completely healed. God has healed your illness, you must believe in the Lord even more!" After a few cripples had oil smeared on them and were prayed for, the people in the church told them to throw away their crutches and walk. They had no choice but to stumble and stagger, covered in sweat. Many people in the church then sang hymns to thank God; but the patients barely reached the door before falling!

    After a blind man was "divinely healed," the church members stretched out a hand and asked him, "'One hand,' can you see it?" He said, "It's one hand." When he walked out of the church, we put cigarettes and a handkerchief in front of his eyes, but he couldn't see them at all. An allegedly mute person who, after being treated in the church, was said to be able to say "Praise Jesus," was still a mute who could not speak when we spoke to him after he left the church. When we tried to approach those patients who were said to have been "cured" after leaving the church, some guys in the church always tried to stop us.

    Many patients, eager for health, were not only subjected to cruel ridicule during their treatment, but also had to put banknotes and gold rings into the church's donation box to "thank God." Gu Ren'en used this method to swindle a lot of money.

    Today, Gu Ren'en's "healing" scam has finally been exposed, and he turns out to be a special agent instructed by American imperialism to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. We resolutely support the People's Government's severe punishment of such counter-revolutionary elements who harm the interests of the people. We hope that all those who have been deceived by Gu Ren'en will come forward to accuse this scum of the religious world and the enemy of the people; and we hope that patriotic religious circles will rise up to thoroughly eliminate these counter-revolutionary elements lurking inside the church.

### 上海灵粮中学师生　揭发特务顾仁恩“治病”骗局

  　揭发特务顾仁恩“治病”骗局编辑同志：
    看到报上登载着披着宗教外衣的特务分子顾仁恩被人民政府逮捕的消息，我们——上海灵粮中学的师生们都很兴奋。现在我们要向大家揭发顾仁恩在上海进行“神医医病”的骗局。
    今年一月，顾仁恩在上海灵粮教堂传道时，妄说自己曾“参加过南昌‘八一’起义”，“参加过政治协商会议”，并“即将应苏联牧师的邀请去苏联传道”。他还捏造说：“我在杭州医病时，有许多人民解放军来请我医病。他们的长官责斥他们，他们拿医好病的事实给长官看，长官也相信了。”
    在他的欺骗下，有一些病人就找他治病。顾仁恩治病时，先用橄榄油在病人头上抹一抹，然后替他祷告；旁边的长老执事们就跟着大声叫：“赞美主，感谢主，你已完全好了。上帝治好了你的病，以后更要相信主！”有几个瘸子经抹油祷告后，教堂里的人就叫他们丢掉拐杖走路。他们无可奈何，跌跌跄跄地累得满头大汗。教堂里许多人这时唱起赞美诗感谢上帝；但病人勉强走到门口就跌倒了！
    一位瞎子在“神医医治”之后，教堂里的教友伸出一只手问他：“‘一只手’，你看得见吗？”他说：“是一只手。”当他走出教堂，我们把香烟和手帕放在他眼前，他根本看不见。一个在教堂内据说经过医治后已能开口讲“赞美耶稣”的哑子走出教堂后，我们和他说话，他仍旧是不能讲话的哑子。我们要去接近那些从教堂走出来据说已被“治好”的病人，教堂里有些家伙总是设法阻止我们。
    许多病人为了渴望健康，在看病时不但遭受了残酷地戏弄，并且为了“感谢上帝”还得把钞票、金戒指投到教堂的奉献箱里，顾仁恩用这办法骗了很多钱。
    今天，顾仁恩“医病”的骗局终于被拆穿了，他原来是受美帝国主义指使来进行反革命活动的特务分子。我们坚决拥护人民政府严厉惩处这样违害人民利益的反革命分子。我们希望所有受过顾仁恩欺骗的人起来控诉这个宗教界的败类与人民的敌人；更希望爱国宗教界人士起来彻底清除这种潜伏在教会内部的反革命分子。
