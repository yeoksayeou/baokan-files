　  World Federation of Youth Calls on Youth to Celebrate
    [By Our Staff Reporter] Combined Xinhua News Agency reports: The working people of the Soviet Union, Korea, and Poland are greeting International Labor Day with new production victories. Since the middle of April, workers at the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow have successfully completed the task of producing trucks for the Turkmen Canal as a result of launching a competition, and have overproduced a number of automobiles. All the factory workers are continuing to carry out production competitions to make more effective use of technical equipment to increase labor productivity and save metal. In the past three months, the factory has saved 9.8 million rubles by adopting about 1,660 rationalization proposals. Construction workers on the Moscow Underground Ring Railway are completing the final section of the tunnel from Novoslobodskaya Station to Belorusskaya Station ahead of schedule, and have begun ground construction work.
    The vast number of workers in the rear of Korea are launching a vigorous patriotic production increase campaign to support the front lines and welcome International Labor Day on May 1st. The production increase competition has already achieved significant results. Workers in the West District Power Supply Department of Pyongyang City, under the Electric Power Administration of the Ministry of Industry, took the lead in challenging all power supply departments in the liberated areas, guaranteeing accident-free power transmission. Electric workers in various places responded enthusiastically. Regardless of enemy aircraft harassment, they persisted in working day and night to ensure that various production organs regularly receive power supplies. Workers at a factory led by Manager Wen Wanyu increased production to 160 percent on the third day after launching the production increase competition. Workers at a railway factory led by Manager Cui Riwu not only decided to complete the April driving plan without accidents with a 20 percent overproduction, but also guaranteed to plant 2,500 pyeong of farms.
    Mass May Day production competitions are underway in enterprises across Poland.
    The World Federation of Democratic Youth, the Communist Parties of the Netherlands and Sweden, and trade union organizations in India and Norway have respectively issued calls to celebrate International Labor Day on May 1st. The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth issued an open letter to the youth of the world, calling on young people of all political and religious beliefs to participate in the celebration of May Day to make this year's May Day a great day for young people around the world to strengthen unity and strive for peace and the economic and social rights of youth.
