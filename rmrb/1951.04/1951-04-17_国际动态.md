　　Korean People's Army Holds Meeting of Motivators

　　The General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army recently held a meeting of People's Army motivators (i.e., propagandists). Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, pointed out at the meeting: Motivators should constantly educate combatants with the idea of ​​unlimited loyalty to the Korean Workers' Party, the leaders of the Republic, and the people; they should enhance the combatants' hatred for the enemy and their desire for revenge; and they should especially educate combatants with the internationalist idea of ​​strengthening the friendship and unity of all people's democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.
　　Indonesian Overseas Chinese Launch Boycott of American Movies

　　Under the slogan of resisting America and aiding Korea, the broad masses of overseas Chinese in Indonesia launched a mass movement to boycott American movies. Starting in early December of last year, Indonesian overseas Chinese newspapers such as "Life News," "New News," and other progressive overseas Chinese publications published articles by overseas Chinese masses opposing watching American movies. Many overseas Chinese signed pledges not to watch American films. In February of this year, students from overseas Chinese schools in Medan, Tanjung Balai, and Kisaran, among other places, signed declarations of determination not to watch American movies. At a Lantern Festival get-together held by overseas Chinese in Madasan, more than two hundred people signed on the spot expressing their determination not to watch American movies, and sent a telegram to the soldiers of the Chinese and Korean peoples to express their respect. In Binjai, many overseas Chinese students, youths, and women published signatures in the overseas Chinese publication "Youth Monthly" of the city, expressing their decision not to watch American movies, and launched a signature collection campaign.
　　Algiers Communist Party Secretary Persecuted

　　The Algiers Supreme Court has sentenced Bouhali, Secretary of the Algiers Communist Party, to one year in prison and a fine of 50,000 francs. Bouhali was tried for exposing colonial oppression and the criminal war waged by French imperialists in Vietnam. The unreasonable persecution of the colonial rulers will only arouse stronger resistance from the oppressed people.
