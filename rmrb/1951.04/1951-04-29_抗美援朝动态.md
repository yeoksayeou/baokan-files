　　Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Dynamics
  New Developments in the Patriotic Movement in the Northwest Region
    Since the launch of the opposition to the United States arming Japan, the patriotic movement in the Northwest Region has seen new developments. By the end of March, various gatherings and demonstrations had been held in the provincial capitals and some small and medium-sized cities in the Northwest, with more than 850,000 people participating. People from all walks of life launched various patriotic activities during the movement. Workers have launched challenge competitions one after another. For example, in the Northwest Textile Factory, the average yarn production per spindle reached more than 0.9 pounds in the competition, setting an unprecedented record in the Northwest. In some areas of Shaanxi and Gansu, farmers have launched a campaign to respond to Li Shunda's challenge. In ethnic minority areas such as Xining, Dihua, and Linxia, people of Hui, Tibetan, Mongolian, Uyghur, Kazakh, Tatar, Uzbek, and Russian ethnicities held anti-American patriotic parades and demonstrations. In order to popularize and deepen this movement and welcome the "May 1st" major demonstration, the leading organs at all levels in the Northwest Region have successively made arrangements. The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed its subordinates to strive for 50% of the population of each county to participate in the Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea movement from mid-April to "May 1st." The Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to adopt a one-person, one-household propaganda method, calling on every cadre, Communist Party member, Communist Youth League member, and activist in factories, schools, and mass organizations to do a good job in publicizing to one household.
  Large-Scale Patriotic Propaganda Activities Launched in Inner Mongolia
    In the Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea movement, Inner Mongolia has launched a massive propaganda campaign. According to reports, during the Spring Festival this year alone, approximately one-half of the total population of Inner Mongolia received Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea patriotic education. Many places in Inner Mongolia vigorously organized propaganda teams, theater troupes, Yangko teams, etc., and adopted various propaganda methods to conduct propaganda activities in rural areas and grasslands. Some places have also established propaganda stations. After the publicity, the people's anti-American patriotic sentiments were greatly encouraged, which promoted the production movement and various tasks in Inner Mongolia.
    Because Inner Mongolia is a gathering place for Mongolian ethnic groups, and the people love literature and art, their main experiences in anti-U.S. aggression and aid Korea propaganda are: (1) Seizing the festivals that the masses are accustomed to, organizing a large number of propaganda teams, and using vivid and lively literary and artistic forms and folk forms to carry out extensive mass propaganda. (2) Combining literary and artistic propaganda with short, easy-to-understand explanations and chats. Without literary and artistic propaganda, it is not easy to attract the masses, and it is not easy for the masses to get a deep impression; relying solely on dramatic makeup performances and not conducting short and easy-to-understand explanations makes it difficult for the masses to deeply understand the essence of the problem. (3) According to the masses' personal experiences and interests, conduct propaganda from small to large, from near to far, adding some vivid stories and practical examples in the middle. This kind of propaganda method is also very effective.
  Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Movement in Henan Province
    The Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea movement in Henan Province has achieved great results. Since the launch of the movement, people from all walks of life in the province have donated materials and cash to慰劳中朝人民战士 and救济朝鲜难民. At the same time, the province launched large-scale anti-American patriotic parades and gatherings to denounce the crimes of American imperialism. According to incomplete statistics, more than 8.7 million people in the province have held parades and demonstrations, and more than 6 million people have launched denunciations. Patriotic propaganda and education have played a great role in various tasks. For example, among workers, 102 units have participated in production competitions. In the patriotic movement, farmers have stepped up land reform, suppressed counter-revolutionaries, responded to the call to "increase production by 10%," and participated in the people's armed forces. People from other walks of life have also actively participated in the movement.
    However, until late April, the Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea movement was not carried out extensively enough in many small towns, general villages, and mountainous areas in Henan Province. The elderly and women were not universally educated in patriotism, and there were still many "blank areas." The leading organs and various groups in Henan Province are now working hard to eliminate these "blank areas."
  Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Movement in Pingyuan Province
    After five months of the Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea patriotic movement, the political consciousness of the broad masses of urban and rural people in Pingyuan Province has been greatly improved, and various tasks in the past winter and this spring have improved significantly. In many areas of Pingyuan Province, the movement has been carried out relatively extensively and deeply. For example, 70% of people from all walks of life in Xinxiang City participated in the movement, and two-thirds of the villages in Anyang Prefecture carried out the Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Spring Festival propaganda. 570,000 people from six counties including Xinxiang participated in the county and district Spring Festival propaganda. However, the overall movement has not been carried out evenly across the province. In some areas, the ideological mobilization of the masses is relatively poor. Especially among the broad masses of workers, the movement has not been carried out extensively enough. In villages with a weak work foundation, the masses do not have enough understanding of combining the anti-American patriotic movement with their own vital interests. The movement has not been fully carried out among religious circles, business circles, housewives, and rural, unorganized masses, and there are still many blank areas. Based on these circumstances, the leading organs of Pingyuan Province have made specific arrangements. Before the "May 1st" International Labor Day, the focus is on popularization; after the "May 1st" Labor Day, the movement will turn to in-depth on the basis of popularization.

专栏：抗美援朝动态

　　抗美援朝动态
  西北区的爱国运动有新发展
    西北区自开展反对美国武装日本后，爱国运动有新的发展。迄三月底止，西北各省省会及部分中小城市都进行了各种集会和示威游行，参加的人数已在八十五万人以上。各阶层人民在运动中展开了各项爱国活动。工人纷纷展开挑战竞赛。如西北纺织厂各厂在竞赛中，每个锭子平均产纱量达到零点九磅以上，创造了西北空前纪录。陕西、甘肃有些地区农民已展开响应李顺达挑战的运动。少数民族地区，如西宁、迪化、临夏等地的回、藏、蒙、维、哈、塔、乌、满、俄等族人民都举行了反美爱国游行示威。西北区的各级领导机关为普及深入这一运动，迎接“五一”大示威，已相继作了布置。中共甘肃省委会指示所属自四月中旬到“五一”，争取每县百分之五十的人口参加抗美援朝运动。中共兰州市委决定采取一人一户的宣传方法，号召每一个干部，共产党员、青年团员及工厂、学校和群众团体中的积极分子每个人做好一户的宣传工作。
  内蒙展开大规模的爱国宣传活动
    内蒙各地在抗美援朝运动中，开展了巨大规模的宣传运动。据报告，仅在今年春节期间，全内蒙区约有总人口二分之一的人民群众受到了抗美援朝爱国教育。内蒙许多地方大力组织了宣传队、剧团、秧歌队等，采用各种宣传方式深入农村和草地进行宣传活动。有的地方并建立了宣传站。经过宣传，大大鼓舞了人民群众的反美爱国情绪，推动了内蒙的生产运动和各项工作的进行。
    内蒙因为是蒙古民族汇集之地，人民群众爱好文艺，它们抗美援朝运动宣传的主要经验是：（一）抓住群众习惯的节日，组织大批宣传队伍，运用生动活泼的文艺形式和民间形式，开展广泛性的群众宣传。（二）文艺宣传与简短通俗的讲解和漫谈相结合。没有文艺宣传，不易吸引群众，且不易使群众得到深刻的印象；单凭戏剧化装表演，不进行简短通俗的讲解，也不易使群众深刻理解问题的本质。（三）根据群众的切身经验和切身利益，由小到大，由近及远地进行宣传，中间再加上些生动的故事，举些实际例子。这样的宣传方法，收效也很大。
  河南省的抗美援朝运动
    河南省的抗美援朝运动已获得很大成绩。自运动开展以来，全省各阶层人民纷纷捐献物资和现款，慰劳中朝人民战士和救济朝鲜难民。同时，全省展开了大规模的反美爱国游行和控诉美帝国主义罪恶的集会。据不完全统计，全省已有八百七十万以上的人民举行了游行示威，六百万以上的人民展开了控诉。爱国的宣传教育，已在各种工作中发挥了很大作用。如在工人中，已有一百零二个单位参加生产竞赛。农民们在爱国运动中加紧土地改革，镇压反革命，响应“增产一成”的号召，参加人民武装。其他各界人民亦均积极参加到运动中来。
    但是直到四月下旬以前，抗美援朝运动在河南省许多小城镇、一般村庄和山地开展得还不够，老年人和妇女受到爱国主义教育不够普遍，还有不少“空白区”。河南省的领导机关和各团体现在正为消灭这些“空白区”而努力。
  平原省的抗美援朝运动
    平原省经五个月来的抗美援朝爱国运动的洗礼，广大城乡群众的政治觉悟有很大提高，去冬今春的各项工作都很有起色。平原省不少地区运动开展比较广泛，深入。如新乡市各界人民百分之七十参加了运动，安阳专区三分之二村庄开展了抗美援朝春节宣传。新乡等六个县参加县区春节宣传者达五十七万人。但整个运动在全省开展还不平衡。有的地区群众思想发动也较差。特别是在广大工人中运动开展很不够。工作基础较薄弱的村庄，群众把反美爱国运动与自己切身利益结合起来的认识不够。宗教界、工商界、家庭妇女以及农村、无组织群众中运动开展还不充分，还有不少空白区。平原省领导机关根据这些情况已作了具体布置。“五一”国际劳动节以前着重普及；“五一”劳动节以后，在普及的基础上把运动转向深入。
