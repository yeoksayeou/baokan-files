(Passed at the 64th Session of the Government Administration Council on December 22, 1950)

Chapter I General Provisions

Article 1: All mineral resources within the territory of the People's Republic of China are owned by the state. Private operation is permitted and encouraged unless state operation is required or the area is designated as a national reserve.

Article 2: Coal mines, oil mines, oil shale mines, and natural gas mines are under the charge of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government. Other mines are under the charge of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government.

Article 3: Applications for prospecting or mining shall be examined and approved by the central mining authority. If the application is for state operation, a prospecting or mining permit shall be issued. If the application is for private operation, a prospecting or mining lease shall be issued.

Joint state-private mining enterprises shall be regarded as state-operated if managed by the government, and as privately-operated if managed by private individuals.

Article 4: Applications for prospecting or mining, whether state-operated or privately-operated, may be designated as national reserves by the central mining authority if one of the following conditions exists:

	1. Domestic reserves are not abundant and must be reserved for national defense emergencies;
	2. The mineral possesses national defense secrecy and must be reserved for designated institutions to operate;
	3. Current production capacity already exceeds demand significantly, and there is no need to open new mines in the near future;
	4. According to the geological structure of the ore deposit, large-scale mining is appropriate, and dispersed operation is not suitable.

Article 5: A mining area is a tract of land defined by straight lines on the surface, extending vertically downwards along the boundaries for prospecting or mining.

Article 6: The area of a mining area shall be 15 hectares or more for coal mines, 2 hectares or more for other mines, and a length of 1 kilometer or more along the riverbed for placer mines to be considered a large mining area. Areas or lengths that do not meet the above minimum limits are considered small mining areas. The designation of small mining areas is limited to those with inconvenient transportation or those unsuitable for large-scale operation.

Article 7: The prospecting and mining periods are limited to two years for prospecting and thirty years for mining in large mining areas and ten years for mining in small mining areas. Upon expiration, applications may be made to extend the prospecting or mining period.

Article 8: The following areas shall not be designated as mining areas without the permission of the relevant authorities in charge:

	1. Within the delineated areas of fortresses, military ports, and airfields;
	2. Within 500 meters of important industrial areas, commercial areas, and important reservoir projects;
	3. Within 150 meters on both sides of important transport routes;
	4. Within 500 meters on both sides of important rivers and flood control dikes;
	5. Locations of famous historical sites with cultural value that cannot be moved.

Article 9: Private development of new mines and continued operation of old mines are encouraged. However, when processing applications from private mining enterprises, the government may, due to factual necessity, reclaim the mine for state operation or designate it as a national reserve:

	1. Those applying for renewal of mining licenses for old mines in accordance with Article 14 of these Regulations;
	2. Those applying for prospecting or mining in new mining areas in accordance with Article 17 of these Regulations;
	3. Large mining areas that have been mined for 30 years and small mining areas that have been mined for 10 years.

When reclaiming for state operation or designating as a national reserve, the government shall purchase the remaining usable equipment in the mining area from the applicant at a fair price. For those applying for prospecting or mining in new mining areas, the government shall provide appropriate compensation to the original applicant based on the value of the mine. If the original applicant wishes to participate in the operation, they may be allowed to invest with the permission of the central mining authority.

Article 10: Mineral products necessary for national defense and basic national industries may be subject to unified purchase and sale by the central authority in charge when necessary.

Article 11: Private mines with a relatively large scale and significant operational achievements, which require additional capital for expanding production capacity, purchasing equipment, and constructing new projects, may apply for government participation in investment by submitting a basic construction plan if they are unable to raise sufficient funds on their own.

Article 12: All state-operated and privately-operated mines must comply with all labor laws related to mines and factories and effectively protect workers.

Article 13: Small-scale mines using indigenous methods of extraction that simultaneously meet the following five conditions are not subject to the restrictions of these Regulations. However, local governments shall formulate simple management measures separately and submit them to the mining authority of the Greater Administrative Area for verification and then to the central mining authority for approval and implementation.

	1. The minerals extracted are necessary for the daily use of nearby residents;
	2. The mining area is located in a remote area, the mineral reserves are not abundant, and there is no value in applying for a small mining area operation;
	3. Local people rely on it as a sideline occupation;
	4. The mining is not deep, and there is no danger of water, fire, or landslides;
	5. There is no harm or damage to public property.

The mining authorities of each Greater Administrative Area or province (municipality) shall periodically report the mineral resources and mining situation within the above-mentioned areas to the central mining authority for record-keeping. If valuable mineral deposits are discovered through mining, the investigation results and proposed handling opinions shall be reported to the central mining authority for approval.
