　　Thoroughly Smash the American Imperialist Espionage and Sabotage Activities
            The Reading Group of Class A, Senior 3, Beijing No. 8 Middle School writes:
    When we saw the news published in the People's Daily on March 21, "Tianjin Cracks American Spy Organization, Captures 21 Chinese and Foreign Spy Criminals," we all jumped up with joy. We all felt very happy for the victory of the public security work.
    The next day, we also specifically studied the March 21st editorial "Smash the American Imperialist Espionage and Sabotage Activities." After discussion, the students further recognized that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, thus deepening their hatred for American imperialism. Everyone unanimously believes that as long as American imperialism exists, the Chinese people will not have peace, and our great construction work cannot develop smoothly - especially the American imperialist aggression in Korea, which directly threatens our country's security. We must wholeheartedly resist America and aid Korea, and thoroughly smash the espionage and sabotage activities of American imperialism, because only in this way can our victory be consolidated. Therefore, we demand that the captured Chinese and foreign counter-revolutionaries, no matter what country they are from, must be severely punished in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries."

　　彻底粉碎美帝国主义间谍破坏活动
            北京市立第八中学高三甲班读报组来信说：
    当我们看到三月二十一日人民日报发表的“天津破获美国间谍组织，捕获中外籍间谍罪犯二十一名”的消息后，大家都高兴得跳起来啦，我们都为公安工作的胜利而感到十分欣快。
    第二天，我们还特别地学习了二十一日的社论《粉碎美帝国主义的间谍破坏活动》。经过讨论，同学们进一步地认识了美帝国主义是我们中国人民的死敌，因此对美帝国主义的仇恨也加深了。大家都一致地认为：有美帝国主义的存在，我们中国人民便不能安生，我们伟大的建设工作便不能顺利地发展，——尤其是美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略行为，更是直接在威胁着我国的安全。我们要全心全意地来抗美援朝，彻底粉碎美帝国主义的间谍破坏活动，因为只有这样，我们的胜利才能巩固。所以我们要求：把这次捕获的中外反革命分子，不论他是那国人，一定要按照《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》来严厉执行。
