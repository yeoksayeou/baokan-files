　　Introduction to "Women in Socialist Countries" by Popova
    Luo Qiong
    The book "Women in Socialist Countries" written by Popova, Chairman of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee and Vice Chairman of the International Democratic Women's Federation, has been translated into Chinese by Mr. Guan Yusu (published by Mars Society in August 1950) and introduced to our readers. This book correctly applies the theories of Marxism-Leninism and, based on the shining example of complete equality between Soviet women and men, points out the correct path to the thorough liberation of women.
    The preface and the first chapter of this book expound the views of Marxist-Leninist women's movements, the heroic history and valuable experience of the Bolshevik Party in leading Russian women to participate in the revolutionary struggle. Here, Popova clearly points out that the women's problem has always existed in private property systems and class societies. "Where there are landlords, capitalists, and merchants, there will be no equality between men and women, even if there are legal provisions, it is impossible." (Page 25 of this book) Although the bourgeoisie superficially touts "equality between men and women," since the vast majority of women are exploited, it is impossible for them to have economic independence, nor can they have social independence, and equality between men and women can only be empty words. They cannot escape the oppression of poverty and have to suffer all kinds of deception, humiliation, and abuse from the old society. Women workers and peasants engaged in productive labor only facilitate the bourgeoisie in lowering wage standards and exploiting workers even more, and the difficult situation of women can never be improved. Therefore, in Tsarist Russia, it was truly "all the disasters are added to the Russian woman" (page 14). Based on these, "revolutionary Marxists believe that the struggle for women's liberation is closely related to the common tasks of the proletariat's struggle for liberation and the struggle to eliminate class society and the victory of communism." (Page 26), and the proletariat's revolutionary struggle can only achieve complete victory by attracting the active participation of the vast number of women. Women can also play a significant role in promoting and encouraging their husbands and sons to participate in the revolutionary struggle. Therefore, "Lenin also pointed out that experience from multiple liberation movements proves that the success of a revolution depends on the degree of women's participation." (Page 28)
    The Bolshevik Party followed this theory and, from its establishment, paid attention to educating women workers and peasants to rise up with their fathers, brothers, and husbands to resist the Tsarist regime and the capitalist social system and strive for their own thorough liberation. In each revolutionary ranks, there were many heroic and resolute revolutionary female fighters fighting side by side with men; at the same time, appropriate slogans were put forward to protect the interests of women, in order to closely unite women.
    Chapters two to five and chapter eight of this book vividly describe the situation and experience of Soviet women under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet regime, actively participating in socialist construction, heroically dedicating themselves to the great war to defend the motherland, and currently enthusiastically participating in communist construction. Because of their such significant contributions to the revolutionary work, Soviet women have obtained complete equal rights with men in politics, economy, culture, and all aspects of society. The state also provides mothers and children with good protection so that women can better exert their active strength. In terms of political construction, Soviet women follow Lenin's call and strive to make every cook learn to manage the state. For example, when only five women were elected to the Central Executive Committee at the First Soviet Congress in 1922, there were 277 female representatives elected to the Supreme Soviet in February 1948, accounting for 20.7 percent of the total number of representatives. Women of originally relatively backward ethnic minorities, like Soviet Russian women, have also gained complete equal rights with men in the big family of Soviet national equality. Now, in the Soviets of the various Union Republics, female representatives account for more than 30 percent of the total number of Soviet representatives. The reason why Soviet women have achieved such amazing progress in politics is mainly because "the Lenin-Stalin Party, in order to fundamentally solve the women's problem, pays special attention to women's political education and strives to absorb women to participate in the practical work of various links in the Soviet state organs." (Page 48) The education of the vast number of women is mainly achieved through these advanced elements among women, and through the representatives' conferences of women workers and peasants and other women's organizations to carry out regular contact.
    Due to the superiority of the socialist economic system, and due to the patient and persistent education work carried out by the Party and the government, women have been given the possibility of unlimited participation in social production. The state has also taken various effective measures to ensure that women can fully display their talents. As Popova pointed out: "The technical improvement of various departments of the national economy, the replacement of manual labor with machines, the vast system of vocational education - training classes, factory schools, and the cultivation of young cadres by skilled producers beside the machines. All methods, plus the national insurance of workers, the protection of women's labor, the equipment of sanatoriums and medical treatment, the development of the network of maternal and child health care institutions, and the development of public nutrition networks, have all made it possible for Soviet women to join the ranks of industrial workers." (Page 63) Therefore, the number of women participating in industrial and agricultural production has increased substantially, especially during the Great Patriotic War, the rate of increase was even greater. For example, from 1940 to 1942, the number of women accounting for the total number of employees in the industrial sector increased from 41 percent to 53 percent, in the railway transportation sector from 25 percent to 36 percent, and even the number of women participating in heavy industrial production also increased rapidly. In various production positions, many skilled female technicians and experts have emerged. In 1930, there were only 3,600 female experts in the entire Soviet Union, and by the eve of the Great Patriotic War, this had increased to more than 1.7 million. The number of Soviet women participating in agricultural production has also increased rapidly, becoming an important force in agricultural production. In 1943, 70 percent of the workdays of collective farmers in the Soviet Union were completed by women. Women's mastery of technology is also no less than that of men. As early as 1941, more than 100,000 women were driving combine harvesters, tractors, and other complex agricultural machinery. During the Great Patriotic War, women accounted for 62.5 percent of the agricultural machinery cadres trained by the government.
    The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government have also used various methods to help women improve their culture and absorb women to participate in cultural construction.
    All of these have completely changed the traditional subordinate status of women in society. Popova clearly pointed out: "Now, it is no longer possible to divide any male and female boundaries in the work of establishing a new socialist culture." (Page 79)
    The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet regime are the most concerned and effective in protecting the interests of women and children in the world. When the Soviet regime was first established, although it was in an extremely difficult environment of war and poverty, it still paid as much attention as possible to the welfare of women and children, and promulgated a series of laws to protect mothers and children year by year, and institutions such as nurseries and maternity hospitals have been increasing substantially. For example, Tsarist Russia had only 19 nurseries, while in 1950, the Soviet Union's nurseries had 1,251,000 regular beds; the number of consultation centers for protecting the health of mothers and infants was only 9 in Tsarist Russia in 1914, but increased to 7,000 in 1941, and the number of hospital maternity beds increased from only 2,824 in 1914 to 142,000 in 1950.
    At present, Soviet women are indeed "the masters who have enjoyed complete equal rights, built magnificent socialist buildings, and resolutely maintained the glory and independence of the motherland in the arduous war test. They have jointly won the historically significant victory over fascist Germany and Japanese imperialism with the entire people. At present, they are dedicating all their energy and knowledge to the success of completing and exceeding Stalin's post-war five-year plan and to the construction of communism in the Soviet Union." (Page 7 - Editor's note: The last sentence has been corrected according to Wang's translation) Soviet women not only have such lofty patriotic enthusiasm, but also have great internationalist aspirations. In chapters six and seven of this book, Popova introduced how Soviet women affectionately care about the lives and status of foreign women, and work together with peace-loving and democratic women all over the world to strive for lasting world peace, people's democracy, and oppose imperialist aggression and war.
    This book tells us that only socialism can completely liberate women, only socialism can inspire women's great creativity, and the road of Soviet women is the road to the thorough liberation of women. Let us better learn from Soviet women so that our women can play a more significant role in the construction of New Democracy.
    Editor's note: In addition to Guan Yusu's translation, this book also has Wang Yiyun's translation, "Women in Socialist Countries," compiled by the Nanjing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and published by the East China People's Publishing House in March 1951.

　　介绍卜波娃著《社会主义国家妇女》
    罗琼
    苏联妇女反法西斯委员会主席，国际民主妇女联合会副主席卜波娃著的《社会主义国家妇女》一书，由关予素先生译成中文（火星社一九五○年八月出版）介绍给我国读者了。这本书正确地运用马克思列宁主义的理论，并根据苏联妇女与男子完全平等的光辉实例，指出了妇女彻底解放的正确的途径。
    本书的前言和第一章阐扬了马克思列宁主义者的妇女运动的观点，布尔什维克党领导俄国妇女参加革命斗争的英勇史迹和宝贵的经验。在这里，卜波娃明确地指出：在私有财产制和阶级社会里，一直就存在着妇女问题，“有地主、资本家、商人存在的地方，是不会有男女平等的，即使有法律规定，也不可能。”（本书二十五页）资产阶级表面上虽然标榜“男女平等”，但广大妇女群众既然都是受剥削者，不可能有经济上的独立，也不可能有社会地位上的独立，男女平等就只能是一句空话。她们丝毫不能摆脱贫困生活的压迫，还要受旧社会的种种欺骗、侮辱、虐待。从事生产劳动的女工、农妇，只是便利了资产阶级压低工资标准，更多剥削工人，妇女的困苦地位，绝不能有所改善。因之在沙皇俄国，真正是“一切的灾难，都加给俄罗斯的女人”（十四页）。基于这些，“革命的马克思主义者认为争取妇女解放的斗争，是与无产阶级争取解放，及争取消灭阶级社会和共产主义胜利的斗争的共同任务，密切相关联的。”（二十六页），而无产阶级的革命斗争，也只有吸引广大妇女积极参加，才能获得彻底的胜利。妇女在推动和鼓励她们的丈夫与子弟参加革命斗争上，也能够起很大的作用。所以“列宁又指明说：由多次的解放运动经验可以证明，革命的成功，要看妇女参加的程度如何来决定的。”（二十八页）
    布尔什维克党遵循了这样的理论，从开始成立的时候起，就注意教育女工、农妇与自己的父、兄、丈夫共同起来反抗沙皇政权和资本主义社会制度，争取自身的彻底解放。在每次革命行列中都有不少英勇的坚决的革命女战士与男子并肩斗争；同时也都提出了保护妇女利益的适当的口号，以便紧密地把妇女团结起来。
    本书的第二至第五章及第八章，生动地描写了苏联妇女在布尔什维克党和苏维埃政权领导之下，积极参加社会主义建设，英勇献身于保卫祖国的伟大战争和目前热烈参加共产主义建设的情况和经验。由于她们在革命工作中有了这样重大的贡献，苏联妇女在政治上经济上文化上及社会各方面已经和男子获得了完全平等的权利。国家又给予了母亲和儿童以很好的保护，以便使妇女能更好地发挥积极的力量。在政权建设方面，苏联妇女遵循着列宁的号召，努力做到使每一个厨娘都学会管理国家。例如当一九二二年第一次苏维埃代表大会上当选的中央执行委员中只有五个妇女，到了一九四八年二月当选的最高苏维埃代表中，就有二百七十七名女代表，占代表总数的百分之二○·七。原来比较落后的少数民族妇女，在苏联民族平等的大家庭里，也和苏维埃俄罗斯妇女同样，获得了与男子完全平等的权利。现在各联盟共和国的苏维埃中，女代表都占苏维埃代表总数的百分之三十以上。苏联妇女在政治上所以能获得如此惊人的进步，主要因为“列宁——斯大林党为了根本解决妇女问题，特别注重妇女的政治教育，并且努力吸收妇女，来参加苏维埃国家机构中的各种环节的实际工作。”（四十八页）对于广大妇女群众的教育，主要是通过妇女中的这些先进分子，通过女工、农妇代表会议与其他各种妇女组织进行经常的联系来实现的。
    由于社会主义经济制度的优越，由于党和政府进行了耐心的、经久不懈的教育工作，就使妇女们得到了无限制参加社会生产事业的可能。国家更采取各种有效的措施，保证妇女能够充分发挥她们的才能。正如卜波娃指出的：“国家经济各部门的技术改良，用机器代替了手工劳动，职业教育的广大制度——训练班、工厂学校，和在机器旁边由熟练生产者带徒弟培养青年干部。所有一切办法，加上职工的国家保险，妇女劳动的保护，卫生疗养院的设备和医药的治疗，母性及婴儿保健机构网的发展，以及公共营养网的发展，都使苏联妇女群众，有加入产业工人行伍的可能。”（六十三页）因此，不论参加工业农业生产的妇女，都大量增加，特别在卫国战争时期，增加的速率更大。例如从一九四○年到一九四二年，妇女占工业部门全体职工的数目由百分之四十一增加到百分之五十三，在铁路运输部门中由百分之二十五增至百分之三十六，甚至参加重工业生产的妇女，也迅速增加。在各种生产岗位上，均出现了不少熟练的女技工和专家。一九三○年全苏联仅有女专家三千六百名，到卫国战争前夕，已增加到一百七十万名之多。苏联妇女参加农业生产的数目也迅速增加，成为农业生产中的重要力量。一九四三年苏联全国集体农民的劳动日中，有百分之七十是妇女完成的。妇女掌握技术也不逊于男子。早在一九四一年就有十万以上妇女驾驶着联合收割机、拖拉机、以及其他复杂的农业机器。在卫国战争时期，政府培养的农业机械干部中，妇女占了百分之六二·五。
    布尔塞维克党和苏联政府又用了各种方法，帮助妇女提高文化，吸收妇女参加文化建设。
    所有这些，就完全改变了妇女在社会中的传统的附庸地位。卜波娃明白的指出：“现今已经不能再在建立社会主义新文化的工作上，分出任何男女的界限。”（七十九页）
    布尔什维克党和苏维埃政权是世界上最关心和最有效地保护妇女和儿童利益的。当苏维埃政权成立初期，虽然处在战争及贫困的极端困难的环境里，还是尽可能地注意妇女儿童的福利事业，逐年地颁布了一连串的保护母亲和儿童的法令，托儿所产科医院等机关，大量增加着。例如沙皇俄国仅有保育所十九处，而一九五○年苏联托儿所经常床位达一、二五一、○○○张；保护母亲和婴儿健康的咨询所，在一九一四年沙皇俄国仅有九处，到一九四一年增至七、○○○处，医院的产床数，一九一四年仅有二、八二四张，一九五○年增至一四二、○○○张。
    目前苏联妇女的确是“已享有完全平等权利的主人翁，建立了社会主义雄壮的建筑，并在艰苦的战争考验中，坚决地保持了祖国的光荣及独立。她们与全体人民共同争取到对法西斯德国及日本帝国主义的具有历史意义的胜利。目前她们又把全部精力与学识供献在完成并超过斯大林战后五年计划的成功及在苏联共产主义的建设工作中。”（第七页——编者按：最后一句根据王译本作了校正）苏联妇女不但满怀着如此崇高的爱国主义的热情，而且有着伟大的国际主义的抱负，在本书第六、七章中，卜波娃介绍了苏联妇女如何亲切地关怀着国外妇女的生活和地位，和全世界爱好和平民主的妇女一起，共同为争取世界持久和平、人民民主，反对帝国主义侵略战争而奋斗。
    这本书告诉我们，只有社会主义能彻底解放妇女，只有社会主义能启发妇女伟大的创造力，苏联妇女的道路，是妇女彻底解放的道路，让我们更好地向苏联妇女学习，使我们的妇女能够在新民主主义的建设事业中发挥更重大的作用。
    编者按：这本书在我国除了关予素的译本外，还有王益云的译本，南京中苏友好协会编，华东人民出版社一九五一年三月初版的《社会主义国家的妇女》。
