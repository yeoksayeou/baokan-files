Cadres in Guohe Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province
    Ideologically Neglectful and Discarding Weapons
    District Armed Forces Department Has Noticed and is Correcting

To the Editor:

    Cadres in Guohe Village, Fifth District, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, generally exhibit a state of ideological paralysis. They believe that the enemy has been driven far away, and there is no more struggle. The four rifles of the village militia, due to improper allocation and poor maintenance, have not been cleaned once since last autumn. Militia member Feng Maosheng said, "Why bother cleaning guns now? They can't be used for plowing or cultivating wasteland." During an inspection on April 14th, all four rifles were so rusted that the bolts could not be pulled back; three of them were missing parts. A portion of the bullets and more than ten broadswords and spears have also completely disappeared.

    Because the village cadres have the mistaken idea of ​​"laying down arms," incidents of sabotage continue to occur in the village. For example, the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries" notice recently posted in the village was torn down by bad elements in less than a day. However, the village cadres did not pay any attention to this.

    After discovering the above situation, the Armed Forces Department of the Fifth District of the county has circulated a notice throughout the district criticizing this paralysis and is specifically helping the village rectify the militia and strengthen public security work.

### 山西平顺县国和村干部  思想麻痹丢弃武器  区武装部已注意纠正

　　山西平顺县国和村干部
    思想麻痹丢弃武器
    区武装部已注意纠正编辑同志：
    山西省平顺县五区国和村干部普遍存在着麻痹思想。他们认为敌人已经打远了，没有什么斗争了。该村民兵的四支步枪，因为分配不当及保管不好，自去秋到现在就没擦过一次。民兵冯毛生说：“现在还擦枪干什么？它又不能锄地开荒。”四月十四日检查时，四支枪都锈得拉不开拴；其中有三支已缺了零件。一部分子弹和十余把大刀、矛枪，也完全不知去向。
    由于该村干部们有着错误的“放下武器”思想，该村的破坏事件不断发生。如最近村中贴出的《惩治反革命条例》布告，不到一天就被坏分子撕掉了。但该村干部对此竟毫不过问。
    该县五区武装部发觉上述情况后，已通报全区批评了这种麻痹思想，并具体帮助该村整顿民兵，加强治安工作。
