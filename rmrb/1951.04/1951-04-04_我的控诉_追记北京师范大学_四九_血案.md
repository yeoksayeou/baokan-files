　　My Accusation
　　——In Memory of the "April 9th" Bloodshed at Beijing Normal University
　　Qiu Xien
    I want to accuse the Kuomintang secret agents Leng Shaoying and Zhang Minzhi who persecuted the student movement, murdered patriotic youth, and created the "April 9th" bloodshed before liberation.
    The "April 9th" bloodshed occurred on April 9, 1948. In order to suppress the patriotic movement of the youth, the secret agents did not hesitate to use the most despicable bloody means to break into Beijing Normal University on the night of April 9th. At that time, I was one of the most severely persecuted, having been beaten to near death several times before regaining consciousness. The circumstances of my persecution were as follows:
    After 12 o'clock on the night of April 9th, I heard a gunshot in the yard and suddenly woke up from my dream. Before I could turn over, I was hit several times with a club. Immediately, I knew that disaster had struck. I shielded myself with the blanket and rushed out. Just as I reached the door, a person holding an electric baton, whose face I couldn't see, shouted loudly: "Where are you going!..." "Smack!" A club hit my leg. A burst of sharp pain knocked me to the ground. As I was writhing on the ground in pain, I saw my classmates in my room and classmates from other rooms, all naked, disheveled, and covered in blood, being dragged away at gunpoint one by one.
    I struggled on the ground, unable to stand up.
    "Drag this bastard away!..." One secret agent grabbed my hand, and another pulled my feet. Half of my body scraped along the ground as I was dragged out. The sand and broken tiles on the ground burned my bare back like fire.
    However, I still had my eyes. I saw along the road, every five or six feet, there was a dark mass of people. They were wearing sunglasses, masks, and hats pulled low, all a group of faceless "ghosts." Every time I was dragged past such a mass of "people," they would frantically shout: "Just get rid of him!..." (meaning to beat to death). Clubs and iron rulers fell on us like raindrops. At this time, gunshots, clubbing sounds, and screams mixed together in this terrifying night.
    When I was dragged to the school gate, I heard someone say: "This guy hasn't seen blood yet!" Then, with a "whoosh," a club struck my head. I used one hand to block it. "Smack!" Instantly, half of my body was numb. When the second club came down, there was a "buzz" in my head, and everything went black. I knew nothing more.
    When I woke up, I found myself loaded onto a truck. On this truck stood three soldiers, holding rifles with bright bayonets. I still couldn't see their faces.
    "Keep your heads down! Anyone who moves will be shot dead!" After a while, the secret agents splashed lime on our eyes. The comrades were choking and unable to breathe, rolling around in the truck. I fiercely stuffed my nose into the crack in the bottom of the truck. At this time, I heard someone outside the truck shouting: "Number eight, number thirteen, number one hundred and four... Are they all here?" "All here!... All here!..." "All here, drive!" A small sedan sounded its horn in front of our truck, and we drove off together.
    In the truck, several sharp bayonets were pressed against our heads; anyone who moved would have a bayonet stuck into their flesh. At this time, I discovered that my hand was broken, my leg was swollen, and the blood on my head had matted my eyes. I was angry and in pain, wishing I could immediately get up and bite those beasts to death! Before long, I fainted again.
    The second time I woke up, I was in a foul-smelling, filthy room. The walls were covered in blood stains, the floor was damp and moldy, and there were spent cartridges, knives, and iron chains scattered everywhere.
    "Crawl down!..." "Smack," a scream, a comrade was knocked over, and then one by one, we all fell to the ground in the same way.
    "Hold out your hands!..." The secret agents used bare electrical wires to tightly bind our hands, watching as they swelled up and turned blue. At this time, one comrade screamed: "You're strangling me!..." Immediately, two people came over and said: "Here, let me loosen it for you!" One person stepped on his head, and two people pulled on the wires binding his hands. With a strong pull, followed by a scream, the secret agents kicked him over and said, "Feeling better now!"
    Fang Shitai, who was heavily injured, and I, slept in a daze in a corner of the room. The blood on our heads had congealed our hair into a hard mat, and we lay naked like corpses on the moldy ground for a night and a half-day. The next afternoon, Comrade Zhao Xueqin, who was wearing a coat when he was arrested, saw that we were both freezing to death and said to the guarding secret agent: "Would you please give my coat to them to cover themselves!..." "Bastard!..." A secret agent cursed and kicked Comrade Zhao in the face. He cried out in pain and fell to the ground, and a black blister the size of a small bun immediately popped up on his face. The comrades gritted their teeth and glared, and I was also breathing heavily with anger. At that time, I thought: we are university students, yet we are not even as good as dogs. I thought of the millions upon millions of kind Chinese people, how many more like us are there! The fire in my heart erupted like a volcano.
    As it was getting dark, an unkempt doctor walked in and poured iodine into our wounds, which were more than an inch deep. The comrades screamed "Mommy! Mommy!" in pain, and some fainted. He used some rags to bandage our wounds. When the lights came on, we were forced to get into the car like the first time we were arrested. At this time, we were all thinking: "Are we going to be shot? Or buried alive?..." It wasn't until we saw our classmates that we realized that the petition of five or six thousand students from seven universities in Beijing had forced them to release us.
    People who have not been persecuted by secret agents may not know the inhuman and conscienceless crimes of the secret agents. I want to use my personal experience to accuse the secret agents of their crimes before the people of the whole country. I firmly support the government's strict suppression of counter-revolutionaries and seek revenge for the victimized compatriots!

### 我的控诉——追记北京师范大学“四九”血案

　　我的控诉        
    ——追记北京师范大学“四九”血案
    邱锡恩
    我要控诉解放前迫害学生运动，谋杀爱国青年，制造“四九”血案的中统特务冷少頴和张民治。
    “四九”血案发生在一九四八年四月九日。特务们为了镇压青年们的爱国运动，不惜以最卑鄙的血腥手段，在四月九日晚上，打进了北京师范大学。当时我是受迫害最厉害、几度被打死又醒过来的一个。我被迫害的经过情形是：
    四月九日晚十二时以后，我听见院子里一声枪响，突然从梦中惊醒，还没等翻过身来，“拍！拍！”身上就挨了好几棒子。立刻我知道祸事到了。我顶着被子，一步抢了出去；刚到门口，一个手捏电棒，看不见面孔的人大吼了一声：“那里去！……”“拍！”一棍子打在我的腿上。一阵骤痛，我倒在地上。我正在地上疼得乱转的时候，看见自己屋子里的同学及别屋的同学，都光着身子，披头散发，一个一个血人一样地被枪指着拉走了。
    我在地上挣扎着，实在站不起来。
    “拖着这个王八蛋走！……”一个特务捉了我的手，一个拉着我的脚。半个身子擦在地上，我被拖了出去。地上的沙子、瓦块，擦着我的光背，像火一样地烧着我的心。
    但是，我还有两只眼睛。我看见沿路两旁每隔五、六尺远，就有黑虎虎的一堆人，他们戴着墨镜、口罩，帽子戴得低低的，都是一群没有面孔的“鬼”。我每被拖过这样一堆一堆的“人”时，他们都疯狂地喊着：“解决了就得啦！……”（打死的意思）棒子、铁尺像雨点一样地落在我们的身上。这时，枪声、棒子声、惨叫声，在这恐怖的夜里混成了一片。
    我被拖到校门口时，听见有人说：“这家伙还没见血！”接着“呼”的一棒子向我头上打来。我用一只手遮了过去。“拍！”一下子我的半个身子都麻了，等第二棒打来时，头顶“嗡”的一声，眼前一黑，一切全不知道了。
    醒来时，我发现被载上了一辆卡车。这车上站着三个兵，手托着上了明晃晃的刺刀的枪。照样地看不见他们的脸。
    “把头低下去！谁动一动便打死谁！”一会，特务把石灰哗！哗！地向我们眼上打来。难友们呛得喘不过气来，在车里乱滚。我狠狠地把鼻子塞在了卡车底边的板缝里，这时我听见车外喊着：“八号、十三号、一百零四号……到齐了没有？”“到齐啦！……到齐啦！……”“到齐了开车！……”一辆小卧车在我们大卡车的前面拉了一声笛，便一同开走了。
    在卡车里，几把飞快的刺刀压在我们的头上；谁动一动，刺刀便插进谁的肉里。这时我发现自己的手断了，腿肿了，头上的鲜血糊住了眼睛。我又气又疼，恨不得立刻爬起来把那些野兽咬死！不一会，我又晕晕糊糊地死了过去。
    二次醒来的时候，是在一间腥臭污浊的屋子里。墙上涂满了污血，地潮得发霉，满地扔着子弹壳，小刀子，铁索……。
    “爬下去！……”“拍”的一声，一声惨叫，一个难友被打翻了，接着一个一个都照样倒在地上。
    “伸出手来！……”特务用没有橡皮的电线捆紧了我们的手，眼看着手都肿了起来，发青了。这时一位难友惨叫着：“勒死我啦！……”立刻走过来两个人说：“来，我给你松松！”一个人踩着他的头，两个人拉着捆手的电线，吃劲一拉，接着一声惨叫，特务们一脚踢翻了他，口里说：“舒服了吧！”
    我和一位伤势很重的房世泰，昏昏地睡在屋的一角，头上的血把头发凝成了一个硬饼，光着屁股，像死人一样地在发霉的地上挺了一夜零半天。第二天下午，一位被捕时穿着大衣的赵学勤同志，看见我们两人快冻死了，对看守的特务说：“你们好不好把我的大衣给他两人盖上！……”“混蛋！……”一个特务骂了一声，一脚踢在赵同志的脸上，他疼得叫了一声就倒在了地上，一个小馒头样大的黑疱，立刻在他脸上冒了出来。同志们一个个咬着牙，瞪着眼，我也气得呼呼地喘起气来。当时我想：我们是大学生，就这样连一条狗都不如。我联想到千千万万中国的善良人民，像我们一样的不知有多少呢！我心头的怒火，像火山爆裂了一样。
    天快黑了，一个不三不四的医生走了进来，把碘酒倒进我们一寸多深的伤口里。难友们疼得“妈呀！妈呀！”地喊着，有的晕了过去。他用些破白布给我们包住了伤口。上灯的时候，又逼着我们像第一次被捕时一样，上了汽车。这时我们都想：“枪毙呢？还是活埋？……”直到我们看见了自己的同学，才知道因为北京七个大学，五、六千人的请愿，逼得他们不得已才把我们放了。
    没有受过特务迫害的人，也许还不知道特务的灭绝人性、丧尽天良的罪行。我要以亲身的经历，在全国人民面前控诉特务的罪行。我坚决拥护政府严厉镇压反革命，替受害的同胞复仇！
