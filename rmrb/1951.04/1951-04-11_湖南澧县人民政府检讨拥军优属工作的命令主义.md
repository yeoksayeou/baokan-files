Response to Readers' Criticism and Suggestions in the People's Daily

Editor,

In the editor's note to the article "Bias in Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families of Servicemen in Li County, Hunan" in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on February 11th, it pointed out the shortcoming of our county's work in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen, which failed to deeply mobilize the masses to achieve conscious and voluntary participation. After our inspection, we found that some cadres had a simple task-oriented viewpoint in their thinking when carrying out this work, and their work methods were simplistic.

On January 18th, our county arranged for the work of giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers during the Spring Festival. Due to the short period of time, with only a dozen days left before the Lunar New Year, some districts failed to carry out in-depth mobilization when carrying out this work, so that the masses consciously and voluntarily donated money. For example, in order to complete the task ahead of schedule, the Third District used methods of challenges and competitions, and individual comrades also stipulated fines. All of these deserve our attention in future work. We have ordered the cadres of the Third District to conduct a self-criticism on this.

　　　      Wen Guangran, County Magistrate of Li County, Hunan Province

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　湖南澧县人民政府检讨拥军优属工作的命令主义编辑同志：
    二月十一日人民日报“读者来信”栏在《湖南澧县拥军优属有偏向》一文的编者按语中，指出了我县拥军优属工作未能深入动员做到群众自觉自愿的缺点。经我们检查，我们在进行这一工作时，某些干部思想上有着单纯任务观点；工作方式简单。
    我县在一月十八日布置了春节优待革命军人家属的工作。因时间短促，距旧历年只有十几天，所以某些区在进行这一工作时，即未能深入动员，使群众自觉自愿捐款。如第三区为了提前完成任务，即用挑战、竞赛的方式，个别同志还规定了罚约。这些均值得我们在今后工作中注意。我们已令三区干部对此进行检讨。
　　　      湖南省澧县县长温光然
