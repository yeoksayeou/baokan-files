　　Tianjin Private Hengyuan Yarn Factory, Deng Xiuying Group
    Improving Newspaper Reading Methods, Absorbing Experiences from Other Factories
    Strengthening Unity, and Greatly Reducing Defect Rate

    The Deng Xiuying group of the reeling B shift at Tianjin Private Hengyuan Yarn Factory has improved its newspaper reading methods, enabling it to absorb the experiences of other factories, thereby improving the group's work. The workers in this group have a very low level of education; among the twelve people, only two have attended primary school for three or four years. Except for one member of the Communist Youth League and a few activists, the majority of the workers in the group have a relatively poor level of awareness. Usually, no meetings can be held successfully, and the group's work has never been done well, including reading newspapers. In the past, the newspaper reading cadre simply read from the newspaper, delivering large articles and entire pages of news in a monotonous way, which did not arouse the workers' interest. As a result, whenever it was time to read the newspaper, some workers went to the nursery to see their children, some went to the toilet to smoke, and some even simply went home. The newspaper reading cadre also felt that the reading was uninspiring. Later, after research by the workshop committee, it was decided to have Li Xiangli, a member of the Communist Youth League with a relatively high level of education in the group, serve as the newspaper reading cadre, and the newspaper reading methods were improved, which greatly changed the situation. Before reading the newspaper, Li Xiangli first carefully read the newspaper, and then, like telling a story, aroused the workers' interest, and then gradually introduced the production experiences of other factories and major national events. In this way, the workers listened with great interest and began to learn advanced experiences from the newspaper to improve the group's work. In the past, the biggest shortcoming of the group was the lack of unity, with no one paying attention to anyone else while working, and no one helping anyone else. After reading the newspaper, they were very moved after hearing about the exemplary deeds of unity and mutual assistance in other factories, so they formulated their own group pact, guaranteeing to develop class love and practice mutual assistance. When it was almost time to get off work, those who were quick would help those who were slow to reel the yarn, greatly strengthening the group's unity. Through reading the newspaper, the group also learned from the experience of state-owned cotton textile factories, holding a production review meeting once a week, correcting many workers' tendency to simply pursue quantity and ignore quality, reducing the waste of reclaimed silk by 20 percent. They also learned from the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang group from the newspaper, formulated labor discipline, and worked to be neither late nor early, and not to leave their posts casually, overcoming the "hot and cold disease" in production. In January of this year, the group challenged the Ma Hengchang group, proposing to ensure that not a single bad thread would be produced, to increase the monthly output to 44.5 bobbins, not to waste small yarn, no yarn tubes would be dropped on the ground, the machine boards would be wiped three times a day, no yarn ends would be left on the machines, to ensure the cleanliness of the machines, to ensure full attendance, to ensure mutual assistance and unity, and to carry out the group's criticism and self-criticism, etc. Except for one bad thread, the Deng Xiuying group had completely achieved the above-mentioned challenge conditions in February, and the output exceeded by 1.5 bobbins.

　　天津私营恒源纱厂邓秀英小组        
    改进读报方法吸收别厂经验        
    团结加强废品率大为降低
    天津私营恒源纱厂摇纱乙班邓秀英小组改进读报方法，使吸收其他工厂经验，小组工作获得提高。该组工友文化程度很低，十二个人中只有两个人上过三、四年小学，全组除了一个青年团员和少数积极分子外，大部工友觉悟程度都比较差，平常什么会也开不成，小组工作始终搞不好，读报也不例外。过去，读报干事只是照着报纸念，大块文章，整版新闻，生吞活剥，引不起工人的兴趣。因而工人每逢到了读报的时候，有的就到托儿所去看孩子，有的到厕所去抽烟，有的甚至干脆回家，读报干事也感觉到念的不起劲。后来经过车间委员的研究，改由该组文化程度比较高的青年团员李襄理担任读报干事，并改进读报方法，情况就大为改变。李襄理在读报以前，首先把报纸仔细看一遍，然后像说故事一样，引起工友们的兴趣，再逐渐介绍别厂的生产经验和国家大事。这样，工友们听得都很入神，并开始从报纸上学习先进经验，改进了小组工作。过去，该组最大的缺点就是互不团结，工作的时候谁也不理谁，谁也不帮助谁。通过读报，他们听到别的工厂团结互助的模范事迹后，很受感动，于是就订立了自己的小组公约，保证发挥阶级友爱，实行互助，在快下工的时候，手快的就帮助手慢的摇线，使小组团结大为加强。通过读报，该组又学习了国营棉纺织厂的经验，每周召开一次生产检讨会，纠正了不少工人单纯追求数量、忽略质量的偏向，使废品回丝减少了百分之二十。他们还从报纸上学习了马恒昌小组的先进经验，订立劳动纪律，作到不迟到不早退，不随便离开工作岗位，克服了生产中的“冷热病”。今年一月份该组向马恒昌小组应战，提出了保证不出一个坏线，把每月产量提高到四十四点五车，不糟蹋小纱，地上不掉纱管，每天擦三次车板，车上不留纱头，保证车的清洁，保证全勤，保证互助团结、展开小组的批评与自我批评等应战条件。除了出了一个坏线以外，邓秀英小组二月份已完全实现上述应战条件，产量并超过一点五车。
