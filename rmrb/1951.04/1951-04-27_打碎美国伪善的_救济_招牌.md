The meeting of the Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for Handling Institutions Receiving American Subsidies for Relief, convened to deal with institutions receiving American subsidies for relief, has opened. This meeting will discuss implementation methods based on the "Decision on Policies for Handling Cultural, Educational, and Relief Institutions and Religious Organizations Receiving American Subsidies" issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on December 29, 1950. As Vice Premier Guo Moruo stated in his report: "Relief institutions receiving American subsidies should be entirely taken over by the China People's Relief Administration." This is the firm will of the Chinese people. This meeting will enable relief organizations and institutions nationwide to draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves based on patriotic ideology, coordinate with the mass movement to resist America and aid Korea, and thoroughly smash the U.S. imperialist's so-called "charity" and "relief," a set of seemingly benevolent but actually ruthless schemes that kill without bloodshed.

For over a century, U.S. imperialism has not only openly engaged in aggression and plunder against the Chinese people but has also donned a mask of "benevolence," taking a tiny fraction of the wealth it extracted from the blood and sweat of the Chinese people and offering it as "alms" in China. This is nothing more than poison wrapped in sugar. Not to mention the distant past, but the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (UNRRA), which infiltrated China after the Japanese surrender and was controlled by U.S. imperialism, was the largest of the "relief" organizations that poisoned the Chinese people. UNRRA supported the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and its anti-people civil war. The so-called "blocking project" at Huayuankou on the Yellow River in 1947 was actually a crime in which U.S. imperialism supported the Chiang bandits in flooding the lower reaches of the old Yellow River course, causing immense losses to countless people, their property, and crops. This is one of the achievements of UNRRA, which claimed to "save" famine victims. The Chinese people have fresh memories of these painful historical lessons.

Imperialist elements, especially U.S. imperialist elements, have long occupied China under the guise of "charity," their hands stained with the blood of the Chinese people. In addition to thousands upon thousands of bloody cases, we now see the bloody case of the Guangzhou Sacred Infant Orphanage. This Sacred Infant Orphanage was a killing field operated by loyal U.S. imperialist lackeys, Canadian imperialist elements, under the cover of "charitable undertakings" and "religious undertakings." These well-fed criminals harmed four thousand Chinese children they had taken in within two years. In the year or so since liberation alone, they directly and indirectly killed over two thousand innocent children. The bodies of the murdered children filled the "Well of Dead Babies." Only forty or so pitiful children remain, tormented to the brink of death. After discovering this bloody crime, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government arrested the leading criminals. The Guangzhou branch of the China People's Relief Administration took over the Sacred Infant Orphanage and rescued the lives of the remaining forty or so children.

The crimes of imperialism in China under the guise of benevolence are countless. The Canaan Orphanage in Beijing, run by the U.S. imperialist element Rileyme, used another method to destroy China's next generation, especially cruelly making children resent their biological parents, resent the new society, resent their own country, and even forget their homeland. The Huayuanshan Nursery in Wuchang, also run by U.S. imperialist elements, the Sisters of St. Joseph, harmed one thousand of our children in one year. Only eleven infants remain, on the verge of death, resembling skeletons. Wuchang School for the Deaf and Dumb, Wuchang St. James' Crippled Persons' Home, Hangzhou Aiyu Children's Home, Xinmin Society Children's Home, Wufu Children's Home, Anglican Children's Home, Hushan Children's Home, Tianshui Children's Home, YMCA Children's Home, etc., were all places where U.S. imperialist elements carried out conspiratorial criminal activities. According to incomplete statistics, a total of about one thousand people died in these places in one year. Detailed information is still under investigation. The foreign imperialist elements at the Nanjing "Ciai Nursery," the "Sacred Heart Children's Home," and other places in Hangzhou, Tianjin, Jiujiang, Fuzhou, etc., similarly cruelly destroyed our children physically and mentally. These "charitable" and "relief" institutions of imperialist elements were all actual slaughterhouses.

If some people previously thought that imperialists running "charitable undertakings" in China were, after all, somewhat beneficial to the Chinese people; if some people previously felt that the Chinese people's condemnation of imperialist cultural aggression as killing without bloodshed was excessive; if some people previously harbored the slightest illusions about imperialism, then the bodies of Chinese children filling the Well of Dead Babies are a bloody refutation of these erroneous views. How long a line would four thousand children make, lined up? How loud would the sounds of four thousand children laughing and playing together be? If four thousand children had not died, how many good laborers would they have grown into? However, they unfortunately died one after another under the cruel torment of imperialist elements. They were like newborn seedlings, trampled to death before they even saw the sunlight. This is the "charity" and "relief" of the imperialists towards the Chinese people!

Today's China is not the China of the past. In the old China, imperialist elements had the freedom to massacre the Chinese people; in the new China, they can no longer have this freedom. Only imperialist elements who, like owls, cannot open their eyes in the daytime, cannot see this earth-shaking change and vainly attempt to continue their crimes of drinking the blood of the Chinese people. The Chinese people will forever remember the bloody case of the Guangzhou Sacred Infant Orphanage and countless other bloody cases. We can only strengthen our determination to oppose imperialism. Any Chinese person who cannot contribute all their strength to the struggle against aggression and in defense of the motherland is first of all letting down the four thousand pitiful children who died at the hands of imperialist elements.

Through these bloody cases, the Chinese people can also more clearly recognize how despicably imperialist elements use the cloak of religion to conceal their crimes of murder. In the Guangzhou Sacred Infant Orphanage, whenever a child died, the criminals would say to the child's parents: "God has called them to heaven!" What a cold-blooded lie! No religion can allow such trampling on life, and no honest religious person can tolerate such an insult to religion.

The Chinese people have complete confidence and sufficient strength to run welfare and relief work well. We must never allow imperialism to continue to use "relief undertakings" and religious undertakings to invade our country. Now, the armies of the Chinese and Korean peoples have defeated the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield. U.S. imperialism is trying to undermine the unity of our people by despicable means. Not long ago, several churches and "relief" religious organizations controlled by the U.S. State Department sent seductive telegrams to several relief and welfare organizations that had previously received American subsidies. Although this conspiracy of U.S. imperialism did not succeed, in the future, U.S. imperialism will continue to use such inducements or use other imperialist elements to carry out aggressive conspiracies. Therefore, people in China's relief and welfare circles, especially religious organizations and individuals, must be especially vigilant, strictly guard against the provocations and inducements of imperialism, and assist the government in exposing counter-revolutionary elements lurking in "relief" undertakings and religious undertakings. Eliminate pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American slave mentality, thereby actively supporting the People's Government, relying on the broad masses, and enhancing the courage of self-reliance.

Today, people in China's relief and welfare circles are taking practical actions to warmly support the decrees of the Central People's Government and have launched a mass movement to accuse U.S. imperialism of aggression and insults, liquidate the remnants of pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American thought, and completely sever ties with U.S. imperialism. In relief work, we must also resolutely implement the policy of the new China's relief and welfare work instructed by Vice Premier Dong Biwu at the People's Relief Representative Conference, namely, implementing a combination of production for self-salvation, social mutual aid, and government subsidies, so that our own relief and welfare work can be done even better.

### 打碎美国伪善的“救济”招牌

　　打碎美国伪善的“救济”招牌
    中央人民政府政务院处理接受美国津贴救济机关委员会所召集的处理接受美国津贴救济机关会议开幕了。这次会议将依据中央人民政府政务院一九五○年十二月二十九日发布的关于“处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定”，商讨实施的办法。正如郭沫若副总理在报告中所说的：“接受美国津贴的救济机关，应由中国人民救济总会全部予以接办。”这是中国人民坚决的意志。这次会议将使全国救济社团及救济机关，在爱国主义思想的基础上，划清敌我的界线，配合抗美援朝的群众运动，彻底粉碎美帝国主义所谓“慈善”“救济”等那一套表面假冒为善，实则杀人不见血的狠毒阴谋。
    一百多年来，美帝国主义不仅公开地对中国人民进行侵略和劫掠；同时，还戴上“仁慈”的假面具，把它吮吸中国人民血汗所得的几十万分之一，拿来作为它在中国的“布施”。这完全是裹着糖衣的毒素。远的不谈，近如日寇投降后渗入中国而由美帝国主义操纵的“联合国善后救济总署”，就是毒害中国人民的“救济”机构中最大的一个。“联总”支持了蒋介石匪帮的反动统治，支持了蒋介石匪帮反人民的内战。一九四七年的所谓黄河花园口的“堵口工程”，实际上是美帝国主义支持蒋匪帮用水淹没黄河故道下游地区，使无数人民和庄稼财产遭受严重损失的罪行。这就是声称“拯救”饥馑灾民的“联总”成绩之一。对于这些惨痛的历史教训，中国人民是记忆犹新的。
    帝国主义分子，尤其是美帝国主义分子打着“慈善”的招牌，长期盘踞在中国，手上沾满了中国人民的鲜血。在成千成万的血案之外，我们现在又看见广州圣婴育婴院的血案。这个圣婴育婴院，是美帝国主义忠实走狗加拿大帝国主义分子在“慈善事业”、“宗教事业”掩护之下的杀人场。这些吃得脑满肠肥的凶犯，两年之中残害了它们所收容的四千名中国儿童，仅仅在解放以来一年多的期间，它们就直接间接害死了两千多无辜的儿童。被害儿童的尸体，填满了死仔井，目前只剩下四十多个可怜的孩子，被它们折磨得奄奄一息。广州市人民政府于发现这件血腥的罪行之后，已将为首的凶犯逮捕。中国人民救济总会广州市分会接管了圣婴育婴院，抢救了残留的四十多个孩子的生命。
    帝国主义在中国假冒为善的罪行是数不清的。美帝国主义分子瑞乐梅在北京办的迦南孤儿院，又用另一种手段来摧残中国的下一代，尤其是狠毒地使孩子们怨恨他们的生身父母，怨恨新社会，怨恨自己的祖国，甚至忘记了祖国。武昌花园山育婴堂也是美帝国主义分子圣若瑟修女主办的，一年内残害了我儿童一千名，现在只剩下十一个婴儿，奄奄一息，形同骷髅。武昌聋哑小学，武昌圣公会仁主残废院，杭州爱育儿童院，新民社儿童院，五福儿童院，圣公会儿童院，湖山儿童院，天水儿童院，青年会儿童院等，都是美帝国主义分子在中国进行阴谋罪恶活动的地方，据不完全统计一年内总共死亡在一千人左右，详细情况正在调查中。南京“慈爱育婴院”、“圣心儿童院”和杭州、天津、九江、福州等地的外国帝国主义分子，同样狠毒地从肉体上和精神上摧残我国儿童。这些帝国主义分子的“慈善”“救济”机关无一不是实际上的屠场。
    如果以前还有人认为帝国主义在中国办“慈善事业”，毕竟对中国人民有些好处；如果以前还有人觉得中国人民斥责帝国主义文化侵略是杀人不见血的过火；如果以前还有人对帝国主义抱有丝毫幻想，那么，填满了死仔井的中国孩子们的尸体便是对这些错误看法的血的驳斥。四千多个孩子排成一队该有多么长呵！四千个孩子在一起欢笑吵闹的声音该有多么响亮呵！四千个孩子如果不死，他们会要长成为多少好的劳动者呵！然而，他们不幸一个跟一个地死在帝国主义分子凶残的折磨之下。他们好象初生的幼苗，还没有见到阳光，就被践踏夭亡了。这就是帝国主义者对中国人民的“慈善”和“救济”！
    今天的中国已经不是过去的中国。在旧中国，帝国主义分子有残杀中国人民的自由；在新中国，他们不能再有这种自由了。只有象枭鸟一样白天睁不开眼睛的帝国主义分子，才看不见这种翻天覆地的转变，妄想继续它们以中国人民的鲜血为饮料的罪行。中国人民永远记得广州圣婴育婴院的血案和其他无数血案，我们只有更加坚定反对帝国主义的决心。任何一个中国人，如果不能把全部力量贡献于反对侵略、保卫祖国的斗争，首先就对不起四千名死在帝国主义分子手里的可怜的孩子们。
    中国人民，通过这些血案，也可以更清楚地认识到：帝国主义分子是在如何卑鄙地利用宗教的外衣来掩饰它们杀人的罪行。在广州圣婴育婴院，只要死了一个孩子，凶犯们就对孩子的父母说：“上帝召他们到天堂去了！”这是何等冷酷的谎言！任何宗教都不能允许这样蹂躏生命，任何正直的宗教徒都不能容忍这种污辱宗教的行为。
    中国人民完全有信心和足够的力量可以办好救济福利事业。我们决不能容许帝国主义继续利用“救济事业”宗教事业等来侵略我国。现在中朝人民的军队在朝鲜战场击败了美国侵略者，美帝国主义力图以卑污的手段破坏我国人民的团结。不久以前，美国国务院控制下的若干教会和“救济”宗教团体即曾向若干原受美国津贴的救济福利社团，发出诱惑性的电报。虽然美帝国主义这一阴谋没有成功，但是，在今后，美帝国主义还会施用这种利诱手段，或利用其它帝国主义分子来进行侵略阴谋。因此，中国的救济福利界人士，特别是宗教团体与个人，必须特别提高警惕，严防帝国主义的挑拨利诱，并且协助政府检举潜伏在“救济”事业宗教事业中的反革命分子。肃清亲美、崇美，恐美的奴隶思想，从而积极拥护人民政府，依靠广大群众，提高自力更生的勇气。
    今天中国救济福利界人士正以实际行动来热烈拥护中央人民政府的法令，并掀起了控诉美帝国主义侵略与侮辱的群众运动，清算亲美、崇美、恐美的思想残余，彻底地割断与美帝国主义的联系。在救济事业上，我们一定也要坚决地贯彻董必武副总理在人民救济代表会议上所指示的新中国救济福利事业的方针，即实施生产自救，社会互济和政府补助三者结合的办法，使我国人民自己的救济福利事业办得更好。
