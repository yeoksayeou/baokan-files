Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 10th—The preparatory committee for the “May Day” demonstration in the Zhuoni Tibetan Autonomous Region in southern Gansu Province has been established. In order to universally educate the more than 70,000 Tibetan people in the region in patriotism, the committee has organized ten work teams, carrying the declaration of the World Peace Council, reprinted in Tibetan, and going deep into the ten townships of the region to conduct door-to-door propaganda. The committee plans to strive for signatures from more than 90 percent of the region's population in support of the conclusion of a peace pact and to hold a vote on the Japanese question in the latter half of this month. It also plans for each township to hold separate demonstrations and parades on "May Day."
    The Tibetan people in Zhuoni County, the capital of the autonomous region, led by Yang Fuxing, director of the Autonomous Region Administrative Committee, have begun signing in support of the conclusion of a peace pact and have held a vote on the Japanese question. Yang Danzhu, a monk official of Zhuoni Temple, personally drew a large peace dove and pasted it on the main hall before mobilizing the monks of the entire temple to sign and vote. After he publicly read the declaration in support of the conclusion of a peace pact, the lamas solemnly signed and voted.

    【新华社兰州十日电】甘肃省南部卓尼藏族自治区“五一”大示威筹备委员会已经成立。为使全区七万多藏族人民普遍受到爱国主义教育，该委员会已组织了十个工作队，带着用藏文翻印的世界和平理事会的宣言，深入到全区的十个乡去，逐户进行宣传。该委员会计划在本月下旬争取全区百分之九十以上的人在拥护缔结和平公约上签名，并举行对日本问题的投票。并计划各乡在“五一”节分别举行示威游行。
    该自治区的首府——卓尼县城的藏族人民，在自治区行政委员会主任委员杨复兴的带领下，已开始在拥护缔结和平公约上签名，并举行了对日本问题的投票。卓尼大寺杨丹珠僧官，在发动全寺喇嘛举行签名和投票以前，曾亲自画了一只很大的和平鸽子贴在大殿上。他在当众宣读拥护缔结和平公约的宣言后，喇嘛们庄严地进行了签名和投票。
