Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a "Letter to Workers Nationwide in Support of the Government's Resolute Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" on April 20th. At the same time, it instructed all national industrial unions, regional unions, and all grassroots union committees to read this document at general membership meetings, representative meetings, or union group meetings and to discuss it. The full text of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' letter to workers nationwide is as follows:

Dear comrades, male and female workers across the country:

The Central People's Government has promulgated the "Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," and local people's governments are carrying out the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries based on these regulations. This is a major event concerning the immediate interests of all workers and all people. Our working class must not only resolutely support and conscientiously study these regulations, but also resolutely rise up to assist the government in carrying out the work of eliminating counter-revolutionaries.

Why is it necessary to punish counter-revolutionaries? Because they are the running dogs of imperialism, the enemies of the people, and the labor traitors and local bullies who have always ridden on our workers' heads, oppressing us and committing all kinds of evil. We want to defend the motherland, but they are willing to betray the motherland and be slaves of imperialism. We want to consolidate the people's power, but they try every means to undermine the people's power. We want to resist America and aid Korea, but they create disturbances in the rear. We want to develop production and prosper the economy, but they sabotage factories, burn warehouses, and cause significant damage to the people's property. They are not reconciled to losing the right to exploit and oppress the working people, not reconciled to losing the right to act recklessly, and still dream of restoring the reactionary forces' rule over the world. From this, it can be seen that if we do not eliminate them, our people's democratic power cannot be well consolidated, our fruits of victory will be in danger of being destroyed, our economic construction will be hindered and damaged, and our work of resisting America and aiding Korea and land reform cannot proceed smoothly. Therefore, in order to consolidate our fruits of victory, to defend our great motherland, to protect our factories and enterprises, to protect our own labor achievements from being destroyed, and for our bright future, we must actively assist the People's Government in eliminating these wolves in sheep's clothing. In Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, Nanjing, and other places, many workers have spontaneously risen to expose counter-revolutionary elements and assist the government in arresting counter-revolutionary elements, achieving considerable results. This is a concrete manifestation of the workers' class consciousness being raised, and it is a concrete action of our working class loving the motherland. We must learn from their example and resolutely support the government's work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

Comrades, male and female workers across the country, what measures should we take to support and help the government suppress counter-revolutionaries? First, we must conscientiously study the "Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries." These regulations are the legal weapon for suppressing counter-revolutionary activities and the standard for judging counter-revolutionary crimes. If we study them clearly, we will be able to understand what kind of person is a counter-revolutionary criminal, and it will be easier to distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, giving those real counter-revolutionary elements a heavy blow. Second, we must denounce the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements. Expose the facts of counter-revolutionary elements harming the people that you have personally experienced or witnessed at various meetings and conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda among the people. In this way, all the people can deeply know the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements and unite to deal with these enemies of the people. Third, we must expose counter-revolutionary elements. Report the facts of counter-revolutionary elements and their crimes that you know or discover to the local government's public security organs, so that counter-revolutionary elements have no way to hide. Fourth, we must raise our vigilance. Everyone should consciously guard against the destructive activities of special agents, pay special attention to protecting the key areas of factories and enterprises, so that special agents have no opportunity to take advantage of. Fifth, we must consolidate the organization of the trade union and cleanse out the labor traitors, bullies, special agents and other counter-revolutionary elements and class dissidents who have infiltrated the trade union. As long as everyone works together in this way, these traitors to the motherland, enemies of the people, bandit leaders, local bullies, traitors and spies, and other counter-revolutionary elements will be punished as they deserve, unable to escape the net, and even more unable to carry out their destructive conspiracies.

Dear comrades, male and female workers across the country, assisting the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries is a glorious task, but also an extremely complex and difficult task. Counter-revolutionary elements are "ghosts" who cannot see the light of day, and their conspiracies and tricks are numerous. They may pretend to be "active" and "progressive" to deceive us, and pretend to cry and beg for pity to deceive us. They may use the relationship of relatives and friends to plead for protection, and they may use money and beauty to carry out seduction and treachery. They may suddenly take drastic measures and carry out assassinations, and they may also bite back and slander good people. But as long as we are all vigilant, as long as we all work together to assist the government in carrying out the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, these heartless and lungless counter-revolutionary elements will never escape the people's net of justice.

Let us all rise up and assist the government in resolutely cleansing these bandits, bullies, and counter-revolutionary elements from our factories, mines, organs, schools, and shops, and demand that the government resolutely suppress those who are the ringleaders in order to consolidate our people's power and consolidate our great people's motherland.

We shout: Resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary elements! Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the great and wise people's leader Chairman Mao!

All-China Federation of Trade Unions

　　中华全国总工会发布告全国工人书
    拥护政府坚决镇压反革命
    号召控诉反革命分子的罪恶并检举特务
    【新华社二十一日讯】中华全国总工会于四月二十日发布“为拥护政府坚决镇压反革命告全国工人书”。同时，并指示全国各产业工会、各地区工会以及所有工会基层委员会，应在全体会员大会或代表会议或工会小组会议上宣读这一文件，并加以讨论。中华全国总工会告全国工人书全文如下：亲爱的全国男女工人同志们：
    中央人民政府颁布了“惩治反革命条例”，各地人民政府正根据这个条例进行镇压反革命的工作。这是关系全体工人和全体人民切身利益的一件大事。我们工人阶级，不但要坚决拥护和认真学习这个条例，并且要坚决地起来协助政府进行肃清反革命的工作。
    为什么要惩治反革命呢？因为他们是帝国主义的走狗，是人民的公敌，是从来骑在我们工人头上欺压我们、无恶不作的工贼恶霸分子。我们要保卫祖国，他们就甘心背叛祖国，做帝国主义的奴才。我们要巩固人民政权，他们就想方设法破坏人民政权。我们要抗美援朝，他们就在后方捣乱。我们要发展生产，繁荣经济，他们就破坏工厂，焚烧仓库，使人民财产遭受重大损害。他们不甘心丧失剥削压迫劳动人民的权利，不甘心丧失横行作恶的权利，至今还梦想恢复反动势力统治的天下。由此可见，不消灭他们，我们的人民民主政权就不能很好地巩固起来，我们的胜利果实就有遭受破坏的危险，我们的经济建设就要受到阻碍和损害，我们的抗美援朝和土地改革工作就不能顺利进行。因此，我们为了巩固我们的胜利果实，为了保卫我们伟大的祖国，为了保护我们的工厂企业，保护我们自己的劳动果实不被毁坏，为了我们美好的将来，我们就必须积极协助人民政府肃清这些狼心狗肺的家伙。北京、天津、上海、武汉、重庆、南京等地有不少工人已经自动起来检举反革命分子，协助政府捉拿反革命分子，作出了不少的成绩。这是工人阶级觉悟提高的具体表现，这是我们工人阶级爱护祖国的具体行动。我们要学习他们的榜样，坚决拥护政府镇压反革命的工作。
    全国男女工友们，我们究竟应该采取什么办法去拥护并帮助政府镇压反革命呢？第一是要认真学习“惩治反革命条例”。这个条例，是镇压反革命活动的法律武器，是判断反革命罪恶的标准。我们研究清楚了，便能了解什么样的人是反革命罪犯，便容易分清敌我，给那些真正反革命分子以狠狠的打击。第二是要控诉反革命分子的罪恶。把你亲身受过的或你亲眼看见的反革命分子残害人民的事实，在各种会议上控诉，在人民中进行广泛的、深入的宣传。这样就可以使全体人民都深切知道反革命分子罪恶，一致起来对付这些人民公敌。第三是要检举反革命分子。就是把你所知道的或发现的反革命分子和他们罪恶的事实报告给当地政府的公安机关，使反革命分子无法隐藏。第四就是要提高警惕。人人都自觉地提防特务分子的破坏活动，特别注意保卫工厂企业的要害地方，使特务分子无隙可乘。第五要巩固工会的组织，把混进工会的工贼、恶霸、特务等反革命分子和阶级异己分子清洗出去。只要大家都齐心协力这样做，便可以使这些祖国叛徒、人民公敌、匪首恶霸、汉奸特务等等反革命分子都受到应有的惩罚，无法漏网，更无法施展他们破坏的阴谋。
    亲爱的全国男女工人同志们，协助政府镇压反革命是一件光荣的工作，也是一件极其复杂困难的工作。反革命分子是些见不得天日的“鬼”，他们的阴谋诡计很多，他们可能装出“积极”“进步”的面孔来蒙蔽我们，装出哭泣求怜的样子来欺骗我们。可以利用亲戚朋友关系来哀求庇护，可以利用金钱美色来施展诱惑奸计。可以突下毒手，实行暗害，也可以反咬一口诬赖好人。但是只要我们大家警惕起来，只要我们大家都齐心协力协助政府进行镇压反革命的工作，这般狼心狗肺的反革命分子就决不能逃出人民法网的。
    让我们一齐起来，协助政府坚决把这些匪徒、恶霸，把这些反革命分子，从我们的工厂、矿山、机关、学校、商店中清洗出去，并要求政府把那些首恶分子加以坚决的镇压，以巩固我们的人民政权，巩固我们伟大的人民祖国。我们高呼：坚决镇压反革命分子！中华人民共和国万岁！伟大英明的人民领袖毛主席万岁！
      中华全国总工会  一九五一年四月二十日
