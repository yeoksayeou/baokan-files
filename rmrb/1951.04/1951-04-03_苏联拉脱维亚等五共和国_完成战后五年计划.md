Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: The five Soviet republics of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Moldavia, and Karelia-Finland have victoriously completed their post-war five-year plans.

　　The Latvian Republic's industrial production completed its post-war five-year plan in three years and nine months. Industrial output in 1949 had already exceeded pre-war levels by more than double, and in 1950 it exceeded the 1949 level by 23 percent, with average monthly production three times higher than pre-war levels. Industrial output increased six-fold in five years. The increase in industrial output in 1950 alone was equivalent to the total output of all enterprises in the republic in 1945. Agriculture in Latvia was fully collectivized in 1949. In 1950, tractor horsepower increased seven-fold compared to 1945, and tractor workload increased fourteen-fold.

　　The Estonian Republic's total industrial output in 1950 was about three times that of pre-war levels and four times that of 1945, with cotton textiles increasing thirty-fold. Ninety percent of farmers in Estonia have joined collective farms. Collective farms and state farms account for 95 percent of the total cultivated land area. The workload of tractors has increased twenty-fold in the five years since the war.

　　The Lithuanian Republic's total industrial output in 1949 had exceeded pre-war levels by 67 percent, and in 1950 it exceeded the 1949 level by 26 percent. The proportion of industry in the national economy increased from 34.9 percent in 1945 to 51.8 percent in 1950. The number of employees has more than doubled compared to pre-war levels. More than 90 percent of farmers in Lithuania have joined collective farms, and the average harvest of collective farms in 1949 was 15 to 20 percent higher than that of individual farmers.

　　The Moldavian Republic's industrial output in 1950 was double that of 1940. More than 600 new enterprises were established during the post-war five-year plan, and the number of employees was one and a half times greater than pre-war levels. The original 657 collective farms in Moldavia have been merged into 301 large collective farms, and 229 rural power stations have been established in the past four years.

　　The Karelia-Finland Republic's total industrial output in 1949 had exceeded the 1940 level, and in 1950 it exceeded the 1949 level by 18 percent. In the past two years alone, the number of electric saws in the timber industry has increased three and a half times, power stations have increased three times, tree-felling tractors have increased about six times, and locomotives have increased three times.
