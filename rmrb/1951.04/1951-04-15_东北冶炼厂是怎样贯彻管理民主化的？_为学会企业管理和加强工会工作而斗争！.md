　　How the Northeast Smelting Plant Implemented Democratic Management?
    Struggle to Learn Enterprise Management and Strengthen Trade Union Work!
    By our reporter Xiao Feng
    I. Moving from Chaos to Order

    The Northeast Smelting Plant is a factory with relatively significant achievements in implementing democratic management. Most of the plant's original equipment was old and relied heavily on manual labor, with only a small portion being mechanized. The plant almost completely ceased operations during the Kuomintang reactionaries' "takeover." After liberation, it was taken over by the Northeast People's Government in early November 1948. With the active restoration efforts of the workers, it officially resumed production on January 14, 1949, and has now entered a stage of planned production. After resuming production, the plant only completed an average of 77% of its production plan from January to April. Even without power outages, it could only complete 82%. In May, due to motor damage, it only completed 50.8%. During those four months, accidents occurred frequently, resulting in serious losses. The main reasons for this phenomenon were: First, the workers' sense of ownership had not yet been established; Second, the thinking and work style of the old management and technical personnel had not been transformed; Third, the old, unreasonable organizational structure and systems had not been reformed, and new systems and production methods had not been established; Fourth, leading cadres representing the people's government in managing people's enterprises lacked a clear understanding of relying on the working class to run people's enterprises well, were still unfamiliar with industrial production management, and did not yet understand the production laws of people's enterprises. It was not until after October 1949, when democratic management was implemented, that the plant's production gradually got on the right track.

    The plant's main products for the first quarter of this year had already been completed by 100.69% on March 25th. The labor productivity of the main products in February of this year increased by 304%, 55.3%, and 93.5% respectively compared to the average production volume in the first five months of 1949. The actual recovery rate of the main products also increased by 40% compared to the average actual recovery rate in the first five months of 1949. In January of this year, the cost of the main products had decreased by 84.2% compared to the average cost in the first five months of 1949. The workers' attendance rate reached 96%, an increase of 6.8% compared to the average attendance rate in the first five months of 1949.

    II. Adjusting Personnel and Removing Obstacles to Implementing Democratic Management

    The first step in implementing democratic management at the Northeast Smelting Plant was primarily to adjust personnel. Prior to the personnel adjustment, many workshop managers and "technicians" isolated the factory's leading cadres from the workers. Plans and intentions from above could not be implemented, and demands and problems from below could not be reported. Motors even broke down without being reported, resulting in serious production losses. Some old personnel had always oppressed the workers, causing widespread discontent. In October 1949, the plant began to adjust personnel. First, a group of cadres such as workshop directors and section chiefs were appointed, and a group of energetic new technical personnel were transferred in, adding new strength to the plant. At the same time, a group of experienced workers with technical knowledge and organizational skills were promoted to lead workshops and teams or to become technicians. The work of those incompetent old managers and "overseer-style" "technicians" was reassigned. In this way, obstacles to implementing democratic management were removed, leadership intentions could be implemented, workers' opinions and production problems could be reported, a bridge was established between leaders and the masses, and there were backbones in the work. After a period of study and research, the newly appointed group of veteran cadres gradually transformed from outsiders to insiders and accelerated the political awareness of new worker cadres under their influence. The newly promoted worker cadres were more familiar with the production process, familiar with operating techniques, and could specifically solve technical difficulties that arose in production. They were also familiar with the actual situation of the factory and the lives of the workers, making it easy to integrate with the workers. Promoting workers to leadership or technical positions was a good practical education for all workers, making them truly feel their position as masters. The old personnel whose jobs were changed generally still had some work, so they could concentrate on production.

  III. Strengthening the Unified Leadership of the Factory Management Committee

    An important aspect of implementing democratic management at the Northeast Smelting Plant was strengthening the Factory Management Committee with the factory director as its core. Before the implementation of democratic management, the leading cadres of the factory's Party, administration, trade union, and youth league were unclear about the idea of relying on the working class to improve production. The Factory Management Committee was reduced to a formality, and the opinions of worker representatives on production and welfare were not promptly addressed. The work of each system was in a state of independent operation. The Party's strength was very weak. In August 1949, Party members accounted for only 3.2% of all employees, so the focus was on developing the Party, but not in conjunction with production. The administration was busy with daily affairs and could not solve the main problems in production. The suggestions and plans of veteran worker Chen Lian'gao and new technician Zhao Qiming to cooperate in creating a magnesia brick furnace were suppressed for a period of time, so that the output and quality of the main products could not be quickly improved. The trade union was engaged in worker welfare in isolation, complaining that the administration did not provide support and assistance. As a result, the prestige of the Party, administration, trade union, and youth league among the workers was reduced, and many workers were dissatisfied. Labor productivity was very low, production plans could not be well completed, accidents occurred frequently, waste was serious, costs were high, and losses were huge.

    In early November 1949, in order to implement democratic management, the factory's leading cadres emphasized the slogan "Unify thinking, unify steps, the Party, administration, trade union, and youth league concentrate their efforts and face production!" First, the principle of relying on the working class to improve production was clarified in thought, breaking the state of independent operation of the Party, administration, trade union, and youth league. Their specific practices were: First, strengthen the work of the Factory Management Committee, establish a regular meeting system of three times a month, the Party, administration, trade union, and youth league leading cadres first discuss when formulating production plans and determining production steps, and the planning section sends the draft plan to the workshops. After the workshops production meetings and all workers' deliberations, the Factory Management Committee concentrates to make decisions, which are announced and implemented by the administration, and a copy of the production plan is given to the Party, trade union, and youth league to implement through their respective organizational systems. The whole factory also regularly holds expanded cadre meetings to check the progress and problems of the production tasks. Cadres at all levels of the Party, trade union, and youth league also participate in this type of meeting in order to unify thinking and unify action. Second, hold a workers' representative meeting once a month, and the administrative leading cadres actively accept workers' opinions at the meeting. Opinions or requests raised by workers are handled immediately if they can be handled, and explanations are immediately given if they cannot be handled; wherever there are errors, the administration humbly conducts self-criticism. One or two major issues are planned to be resolved at each meeting, so that the worker representatives feel that "problems can really be solved." Third, under the unified leadership of the Factory Management Committee, the Party, administration, trade union, and youth league face production and carry out the work of each system with a division of labor. The Party conducts political and ideological education among the staff and workers, runs training classes and spare-time schools to improve the political awareness of the workers, and absorbs outstanding technicians, technical personnel, etc. into the Party from the production movement, so that the Party grasps technology. The branch also often educates Party members to play a leading and backbone role in production. The administration is responsible for the overall production and operation management work, and actively cares about the work of the branch, trade union, and youth league, regarding the Party, league, and mass work as one of their own responsibilities, and provides all necessary conditions and assistance to the Party, trade union, and youth league in their work. The trade union organizes production work such as setting records and ordering workshop contracts and group plans (including production tasks, specific plans, raw materials and technical quotas, and labor discipline), and runs blackboard newspapers, draws various production charts, and uses express reports and drawings created by the masses themselves to conduct extensive propaganda and mobilization work, in order to promote advanced production experience, improve political and ideological awareness, and encourage the labor enthusiasm of the workers. For welfare, improvements are obtained by improving production. The Youth League focuses on leading league members and young workers to learn culture and technology, and cooperates with the trade union in cultural and recreational activities. As a result, the Party, trade union, and youth league have all developed. By the end of 1950, Party members had reached 14% of the total number of employees, two-thirds of whom were skilled workers and people familiar with technology and production. Trade union members had reached 91.7%. League members had developed to account for 45.3% of young workers. The workers' enthusiasm and creativity have also been brought into play. In the new record movement launched in mid-October, 33 major new records were created in one month by mid-November, saving the state more than 3.4 billion Northeast currency. The magnesia brick furnace plan created by veteran worker Chen Lian'gao and new technician Zhao Qiming was also realized, which increased the daily output of the main products by 64% and the actual recovery rate reached 74.1%.

  IV. Mobilize the Workers to Establish a Production Responsibility System

    In the process of implementing democratic management, the Northeast Smelting Plant also mobilized the workers to establish a production responsibility system, combining democratic management and the production responsibility system, becoming democracy with a responsibility system, and a responsibility system based on democracy. The establishment of the production responsibility system in the plant was formulated after mobilizing the workers to discuss and study from the bottom up and from the top down. There are two specific methods: First, the Factory Management Committee summarizes experience and lessons, and according to scientific theory principles, drafts a draft system, which is fully deliberated and discussed by all workers, proposes opinions, supplements and revises it, and then publishes it for implementation; Second, convene a general meeting of workers, enlighten everyone to put forward rationalization proposals, let everyone criticize the shortcomings in the work, put forward the existing problems and solutions of various mechanical equipment, etc., and if any of them should be formulated into a system, the Factory Management Committee will draft a draft system, which will be discussed by the workers, and then promulgated and implemented.

    When establishing the system, many ideological concerns existed among workers and technicians, and some difficulties existed in operation methods and technology. The plant's leading cadres and trade union conducted in-depth mobilization and explanation, and specifically helped solve difficulties, improved the workers' political and ideological awareness, and realized that being responsible for production is a manifestation of "being the master of the house," and promoted a responsible spirit. In the implementation of the system, technical education was also carried out, constantly explaining the principles of the articles stipulated in the system, explaining the technical theory related to on-site practical operation, and studying the experience and lessons of accidents, making the system easy to implement. After the system was implemented, the workers' labor discipline was strengthened, the phenomenon of no one being responsible and frequent accidents was eliminated, safe production was guaranteed, operation methods and technology were improved, waste was reduced, and production efficiency was improved. The current efficiency of the electrolysis of the main products in the plant in 1950 increased by an average of 18% compared to 1949. The tool responsibility system, the full handover shift system, the operating procedures and machine repair system in the production responsibility system formulated by the plant are very effective systems.

    The experience gained by the plant in implementing the system is: First, some systems should be supplemented or modified to adapt to the development of production, operation and technology improvement, so inspection and summarization are very important. Second, the weights and measures and calculation methods should be unified, the statistical staff should be under unified leadership, and the inspection of raw materials and finished products should be strengthened. Third, those who violate the system or deliberately fail to implement the system should be given necessary punishment according to the circumstances and with the consent of the workers; and the workers' sense of responsibility and overall concept must be promoted to achieve mutual supervision.

  V. Unite Technical Personnel and Combine Labor with Technology

    In the work of implementing democratic management and relying on the working class to improve production, the Northeast Smelting Plant also paid attention to uniting technical personnel and combining the workers' labor and wisdom with the scientific and technical theories of technical personnel. Before the thinking style of the general technical personnel has not been transformed, only a few technical personnel can go deep into the site and help the workers solve some difficulties that occur in the operation. Most of the technical personnel have the following situations: Some technical personnel are not serious about their work and are not responsible for the work they are responsible for. After the machine fails on the site, they shirk their responsibilities to each other. Some technical personnel have more book knowledge and less on-site experience, and it is difficult to solve the problems and difficulties that occur in on-site operation. When they arrive at the site, they cannot solve the practical problems, and they are afraid that the workers will find out their shortcomings, so they dare not go to the site again. Some people lack the emotions and methods to approach the workers, so they cannot get along with the workers when they meet. The plant's leading cadres took the lead in going deep into the site and patiently educating the technical personnel, gradually changing the phenomenon of separation between technology and labor.

    The Northeast Smelting Plant's approach to uniting technical personnel to face the site is: First, organize technical personnel to carry out political and theoretical study. The main contents of the study are political economy and the "Instructions on Further Uniting Technical Personnel and Staff in Public Enterprises" of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, so that technical personnel realize that they are also members of the working class and improve their political awareness. Second, absorb technical personnel to participate in various activities and care about their political life. When the Factory Management Committee, workshop production meetings, etc. are held, absorb technical personnel to participate and listen to their opinions on production and technology. The Party and the administration talk to the technical personnel and often hold symposiums for technical personnel and staff to humbly listen to their opinions and suggestions. The Party also pays attention to absorbing outstanding members of them into the Party, so that the technical personnel feel that their future is bright. Third, in the work, the administration strengthens leadership and assistance to the technical personnel. The administration stipulates the work tasks of the technical personnel, requiring them to make a small summary every day and a big summary every ten days to report the situation and problems. If an accident occurs, the administration will organize technical personnel and veteran workers to conduct a forum to study the cause of the accident and absorb experience and lessons. The administration also organizes all the plant's technical personnel to report the causes of the failures that occur on the site and the solutions from time to time, exchange experience, so that the technical personnel gradually combine book knowledge with practical experience and improve their professional level. Fourth, the administration also timely commends and encourages the progress and achievements of technical personnel and actively takes care of their lives, which encourages the enthusiasm of technical personnel.

    After education and practice, the technical personnel of the Northeast Smelting Plant have been able to go deep into the site and solve some problems that have occurred in operation and machines. Some technical personnel are even reluctant to leave the site. In their work, technical personnel and veteran workers cooperate and work together to create many new records. In the fourth quarter of 1949 to the first quarter of 1950, more than 20 of the 30 technical personnel in the plant cooperated with veteran workers to create new records. A certain metallurgical research group jointly organized by a technical personnel and workers solved 36 large and small technical problems in 20 days in April 1950.

  VI. Care about Workers' Welfare and Correctly Implement Incentive Policies

    To implement democratic management, it is also necessary to combine the workers' political and ideological awareness with their material interests. The leading cadres of the Northeast Smelting Plant and the Party and trade union have paid attention to caring about the workers' labor protection, collective welfare and material rewards.

    In terms of workers' collective welfare facilities and labor protection, the plant paid attention to doing a good job in food, opening worker health canteens, establishing night-time spare-time sanatoriums and expanding medical clinics, building eight large bathhouses that can accommodate about 100 people at a time and expanding worker dormitories, and strengthening safety equipment, smoke prevention equipment and timely issuing labor protection supplies. In addition, each workshop has established a workshop club - a place for workers to study, rest, and entertain themselves. In 1950, 44% of the total number of workers enjoyed health care benefits, and more than 100,000 pieces of labor protection supplies such as work clothes, masks, rubber gloves, and rubber shoes were issued to workers.

    The plant's rewards are carried out in accordance with the principle of "more work, more pay." The reward methods are divided into collective and individual types. In terms of collective rewards, there are several types: First, workshop cost reduction collective rewards, which are applicable to workshops that have carried out workshop cost accounting; Second, workshop excess collective rewards, which are applicable to workshops that have not yet carried out workshop cost accounting; Third, safe operation progressive rewards, which are implemented in the power sector; Fourth, maintenance rewards, which are implemented in the repair sector. In terms of individual rewards, there are two types: First, the semi-annual award system, which is implemented among technical personnel and staff; Second, new record and rationalization proposal rewards. The implementation of the reward methods has further encouraged the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. In 1950, there were 160 inventions and rationalization proposals from workers in the plant, of which 79 were proposed by individuals and 81 were proposed by collectives. The new record bonus issued amounted to 65.4 billion Northeast currency. The Zhang Dianqi group of the plant originally used red and black dots to record the achievements of the workers. In February of this year, they changed to using scoring and scoring, plus improved operation methods, and labor productivity increased by 32%.

  VII. Conclusion

    The process of implementing democratic management in the Northeast Smelting Plant shows that to transform a bureaucratic capitalist enterprise into a people's enterprise, it is necessary to go through democratic reform and implement the principle of relying on the working class in order to improve production. Now, on the basis of democratic management, the plant has initially implemented economic accounting last year, and from January of this year, it will further implement the economic accounting system to achieve enterprise management. In its work, the plant must also pay attention to strengthening ideological leadership, promoting criticism and self-criticism, and summarizing individual local experiences to make them a systematized guiding ideology and principles in order to better implement democratic management and enterprise management.

　　东北冶炼厂是怎样贯彻管理民主化的？
    为学会企业管理和加强工会工作而斗争！
    本报记者  萧风
    一、从混乱迈向正轨
    东北冶炼厂是贯彻管理民主化较有成就的一个工厂。该厂原有设备大多老旧，并大多是用体力作业，仅一部分是机械化。该厂在国民党反动派“劫收”时几乎全部停工。解放以后，一九四八年十一月初由东北人民政府接管，在工人们积极修复下，于一九四九年一月十四日正式恢复生产，今年已进入有计划的生产的阶段。该厂恢复生产后，一至四月平均只完成了生产计划的百分之七七，如果不受停电影响，也只能完成百分之八二；至五月份，因电机损坏，只完成了百分之五○·八。四个月中，事故迭出，损失严重。产生这一现象的主要原因是：一、工人群众的主人翁思想还没有树立；二、旧的管理人员和技术人员的思想和作风还没有改造；三、旧的不合理的组织机构和制度还没有改革，新的制度和生产方式还没有确立；四、代表人民政权管理人民企业的领导干部对依靠工人阶级办好人民企业的思想还不明确，对管理工业生产还是外行，还不知道人民企业的生产规律。直到一九四九年十月以后，贯彻了管理民主化，该厂的生产才逐渐走上了正轨。
    该厂今年第一季度的主要产品，已经在三月二十五日完成了百分之一○○·六九。今年二月份的主要产品的劳动生产率已比一九四九年头五个月的平均生产量分别提高了百分之三○四、百分之五五·三和百分之九三·五。主要产品的实收率也比一九四九年头五个月的平均实收率提高了百分之四○。今年一月份，主要产品的成本已比一九四九年头五个月的平均成本，降低了百分之八四·二。工人的出勤率已达到百分之九六，比一九四九年头五个月的平均出勤率提高了百分之六·八。
    二、调整人员，扫除贯彻管理民主化的障碍
    东北冶炼厂贯彻管理民主化的第一步工作，主要是调整了人员。该厂在调整人员以前，有许多车间的管理人员和“技术员”，隔绝了工厂领导干部和工人之间的联系，上面的计划和意图贯彻不下去，下面的要求和问题反映不上来，甚至电机坏了也不向上报告，以致生产遭受到严重的损失。有些旧的人员，向来欺压工人，早为工人所不满。一九四九年十月，该厂开始着手调整人员。首先配备了一批车间主任、科长等干部，并调入了一批有朝气的新的技术人员，增加了该厂的新的力量。同时提拔了一批懂技术而有组织能力的老工人，担任车间和班的领导工作或技术员。调换了那些不称职的旧管理人员和“监工式”的“技术员”的工作。这样，贯彻管理民主化的障碍扫除了，领导意图可以贯彻下去了，工人中的意见和生产中的问题可以反映上来了，领导与群众之间有了桥梁，工作中有了骨干。新配备的一批老干部经过一个时期的学习钻研，也逐渐由外行变成了内行，并在他们的影响之下，加速了新的工人干部的政治觉悟。新提拔的工人干部比较熟悉生产过程，熟悉操作技术，能具体解决生产中所发生的技术上的困难。他们又熟悉工厂实际情况，熟悉工人生活，容易与工人打成一片。提拔工人担任领导工作或技术工作，对全体工人是很好的实际教育，使他们切实感觉到自己主人翁的地位。被调换了工作的旧人员，一般仍然有一定的工作，因而能安心生产。
  三、健全工厂管理委员会的统一领导
    东北冶炼厂贯彻管理民主化的重要环节，是健全了以厂长为核心的工厂管理委员会。在贯彻管理民主化以前，该厂党、行政、工会、青年团的领导干部，对依靠工人阶级搞好生产的思想还不明确，工厂管理委员会流于形式，工人代表提出的有关生产和福利等的意见并未及时处理。各系统的工作则是处于各自为政的状态。党的力量非常薄弱，一九四九年八月，党员仅占全体职工的百分之三·二，因而着重发展党，但并未结合生产。行政则忙于日常事务，不能解决生产中存在的主要问题。老工人陈连高和新技术员赵启明合作创造镁砖炉的建议和计划，都被压了一个时期，以致主要产品的产量和质量都不能迅速提高。工会则是孤立地搞工人福利，埋怨行政不给以支持和帮助。结果是减低了党、行政、工会、青年团在工人群众中的威信，并引起许多工人的不满，劳动生产率甚低，生产计划也就不能很好完成，事故迭出，浪费严重，成本很高，损失巨大。
    一九四九年十一月初，为了贯彻管理民主化，该厂领导干部强调提出了“统一思想，统一步调，党、行政、工会、青年团集中力量，面向生产！”的口号，首先在思想上明确了依靠工人阶级搞好生产的方针，打破了党、行政、工会、青年团各自为政的状况。他们的具体作法是：第一，加强工厂管理委员会的工作，确立每月三次的定期会议制度，在制订生产计划和确定生产步骤时，党、行政、工会、青年团领导干部先商量，并由计划科把计划草案发给车间，经过车间生产会议和全体工人的酝酿讨论，再由工厂管理委员会集中起来作出决定，由行政公布执行，并把生产计划交给党、工会、青年团各一份，通过各组织系统去贯彻。全厂并经常举行扩大干部会议，检查生产任务的进行情况和问题。在这种会议上，党、工会、青年团各级干部也参加，以求统一思想，统一行动。第二，每月召开职工代表会议一次，行政领导干部则在会上积极接受职工意见，对于工人提出的意见或要求，能办的立即办，不能办的也立即加以解释；凡有错误之处，行政上即虚心进行自我批评。每次会议上，有计划地解决一两个重大问题，使工人代表感到“真能解决问题”。第三，党、行政、工会、青年团在工厂管理委员会的统一领导下，面向生产，分工进行各个系统的工作。党在职工中进行政治思想的教育，办训练班、业余学校等以提高工人的政治觉悟，并从生产运动中吸收优秀的技术工人、技术人员等为党员、使党掌握了技术。支部又经常教育党员在生产中发挥带头和骨干作用。行政负责全面的生产经营管理工作，并主动关心支部、工会、青年团的工作，把党、团和群众工作看成是自己的责任之一，在工作中给党、工会、青年团以一切便利条件和帮助。工会则进行创纪录和订车间合同、小组计划（包括生产任务、具体计划、原材料和技术定额、劳动纪律）等组织生产的工作，并办黑板报，绘制各种生产图表，以及群众用自己创作的快板、图画等，广泛地进行宣传鼓动工作，以推广先进生产经验，提高政治思想觉悟，鼓舞工人群众的劳动热情。对于福利则从提高生产来取得改进。青年团着重领导团员和青年工人，学习文化和技术，配合工会进行文化娱乐。这样作的结果是，党、工会、青年团都得到了发展。一九五○年底，党员已达职工总数的百分之一四，其中三分之二是技术工人和熟悉技术、熟悉生产的人员。工会会员已达百分之九一·七。团员发展到占青年工人的百分之四五·三。工人的积极性和创造性也发挥出来了。在十月中旬开展的新纪录运动，到十一月中旬的一个月中，创造了重大的新纪录三十三件，为国家节省了东北币三十四亿元以上。老工人陈连高和新技术员赵启明合作创造的镁砖炉计划也得以实现，使主要产品的日产量提高了百分之六四，实收率达到了百分之七四·一。
  四、发动工人群众建立生产责任制
    东北冶炼厂在贯彻管理民主化过程中，并发动工人群众建立生产责任制，使管理民主化和生产责任制结合起来，成为有责任制的民主，在民主基础上的责任制。该厂建立生产责任制是发动工人群众自下而上、自上而下地讨论研究后制定的，具体作法有二：一、由工厂管理委员会总结经验教训，并根据科学理论原则，拟出制度草案，经过全体工人充分酝酿讨论，提出意见，补充修正后公布实行；二、召开全体工人大会，启发大家提出合理化建议，让大家批评工作中的缺点，提出各种机械设备等所存在的问题和解决的办法，其中有应该订成制度的，则由工厂管理委员会拟出制度草案，经过工人讨论，然后公布实行。
    该厂在建立制度时，工人和技术人员中存在许多思想顾虑，并在操作方法和技术上存在某些困难。该厂领导干部和工会就进行了深入的动员解释，并具体帮助解决困难，提高了工人群众的政治思想觉悟，认识到对生产负责就是“当家作主”的表现，发扬了负责精神。在实行制度时，又进行了技术教育，不断地解说制度中所规定的条文的原则，讲解有关现场实际操作的技术理论，以及研究发生事故的经验教训，使制度易于贯彻。制度实行后，加强了工人群众的劳动纪律，消灭了无人负责、常出事故的现象，保证了安全生产，改进了操作方法和技术，减少了浪费，提高了生产效率。该厂电解主要产品的电流效率，一九五○年就比一九四九年平均提高了百分之一八。该厂所订生产责任制度中的工具负责制、全体交接班制、操作规程和机器检修制等是成效很大的制度。
    该厂在实行制度时，得到的经验是：一、某些制度要适应着生产的发展、操作和技术的改进，加以补充或修改，因而检查和总结就非常重要。二、度量衡和计算方法要统一，统计人员要统一领导，原材料和制成品等要加强检验。三、对于违反制度或故意不执行制度的人，要区别情节，并取得工人同意，予以必要的处分；并须发扬工人的责任心和整体观念，作到互相监督。
  五、团结技术人员，使劳动与技术相结合
    东北冶炼厂在贯彻管理民主化，依靠工人阶级搞好生产的工作中，还注意了团结技术人员，使工人的劳动和智慧，与技术人员的科学技术理论相结合。该厂在一般技术人员的思想作风没有转变以前，只有少数技术人员能够深入现场，帮助工人解决一些在操作中发生的困难，大多数的技术人员，则有下面这样一些情况：有些技术人员对自己负责的工作不认真负责，在现场机器发生故障后，又互相推诿责任。有些技术人员书本知识多，现场经验少，很难解决现场操作中发生的问题与困难，他们到了现场，不能解决实际问题，怕工人找出自己的缺点，也就再不敢去现场了。有些人则缺乏接近工人的情感与办法，因而和工人见了面也不能打成一片。该厂领导干部即以身作则，深入现场，对技术人员耐心进行教育，逐渐改变了技术和劳动脱节的现象。
    东北冶炼厂团结技术人员面向现场的作法是：首先，组织技术人员进行政治和理论学习，主要的学习内容是政治经济学和中共中央东北局“关于进一步团结公营企业中技术人员与职员的指示”，使技术人员认识了自己也是工人阶级的一分子，提高了自己的政治觉悟。第二，吸收技术人员参加各种活动，并关心他们的政治生活。工厂管理委员会、车间生产会议等开会时，吸收技术人员参加，听取他们对于生产和技术方面的意见。党和行政找技术人员谈心，并经常召开技术人员和职员的座谈会，虚心听取他们的意见和建议。党又注意吸收他们中的优秀分子入党，使技术人员感觉到自己的前途光明。第三，在工作中，行政对技术人员加强领导和帮助。行政规定了技术人员的工作任务，要他们每天作小结，每十天作大结，汇报情况和问题。如果发生事故，行政即组织技术人员和老工人进行座谈，研究事故的原因，吸收经验教训。行政并不定期组织全厂技术人员分别报告现场中发生故障的原因和解决的办法，交流经验，使技术人员逐渐地把书本知识和实际经验结合起来，提高了业务水平。第四，行政又及时地表扬和鼓励技术人员的进步和成绩，并主动照顾他们的生活，鼓舞了技术人员的积极性。
    经过教育和实践以后，东北冶炼厂的技术人员已能深入现场，并解决了一些操作和机器所发生的问题。有的技术人员甚至舍不得离开现场了。在工作中，技术人员和老工人合作，共同钻研，创造了不少的新纪录。在一九四九年第四季度到一九五○年第一季度，该厂三十个技术人员中有二十多个和老工人合作创造了新纪录。一个技术人员和工人共同组织的某种冶金研究小组，曾在一九五○年四月份的二十天中，解决了三十六个大小技术问题。
  六、关心工人福利和正确实行奖励政策
    贯彻管理民主化，还必须将工人的政治思想觉悟和物质利益结合起来，东北冶炼厂的领导干部和党、工会都注意到关心工人的劳动保护、集体福利和物质奖励。
    该厂在工人的集体福利设施和劳动保护方面，注意了办好伙食，开办工人保健食堂，建立夜间业余疗养所和扩大医疗所，修建了每次能容纳一百人左右的八个大澡池和扩充工人宿舍，并加强了安全设备、防烟设备和及时发给劳动保护用品。此外，每个车间都建立了车间俱乐部——工人们学习、休息、娱乐的场所。一九五○年一年中，享受保健待遇的工人占总人数的百分之四四，发给工人的劳动保护用品如工作服、口罩、胶皮手套、胶皮鞋等大小共达十万件以上。
    该厂的奖励是按照“多劳多得”的原则进行的。奖励的办法分集体的和个人的两种。在集体奖励方面，有这样几种：一、车间降低成本集体奖励，适用于已进行车间成本计算的车间；二、车间超额集体奖励，适用于尚未进行车间成本计算的车间；三、安全运转累进奖励，实行于动力部门；四、保修奖励，实行于修理部门。在个人奖励方面，有这样两种：一、半年评奖制度，实行于技术人员和职员之间；二、新纪录与合理化建议奖励。奖励办法的实行，更鼓励了工人群众的积极性和创造性。一九五○年中该厂工人的创造发明和合理化建议有一六○件，其中个人提出的有七九件，集体提出的有八一件。发给的新纪录奖金共达东北币六百五十四亿元。该厂张殿其小组，记录工人的成绩原是用红黑点，今年二月改用了计分评分，加上改进操作方法，劳动生产率就提高了百分之三二。
  七、结语
    东北冶炼厂贯彻管理民主化的过程，说明了把官僚资本主义企业改造成为人民企业，必须经过民主改革，实现依靠工人阶级的方针，才能搞好生产。现在，该厂在管理民主化的基础上，经过去年初步实行经济核算，从今年一月起，进一步贯彻经济核算制，以实现经营企业化。在工作中，该厂还须注意加强思想领导，发扬批评与自我批评，并把个别的局部的经验加以总结，使之成为系统化的指导思想和原则，以更好地贯彻管理民主化和经营企业化。
