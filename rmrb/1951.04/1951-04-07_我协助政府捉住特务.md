　　I Assisted the Government in Capturing a Special Agent
　　Tianjin Tricycle Worker Shang Guanghe
　　Editor's Note: The bandit Wu Cunzhuo, who was executed in Tianjin last month after a public trial, was a counter-revolutionary criminal who had infiltrated the factory to murder our cadres and workers. The following article is a narrative by Shang Guanghe, a tricycle worker in Tianjin, recounting how he assisted the Public Security Bureau in capturing Wu after Wu committed the crime and attempted to flee.

　　I am a "morning rider." That morning, I started work at five o'clock. After completing one trip, I was heading back from Yaohua Lane. It was still dark, and a northwest wind was blowing. Because I was pedaling quickly, I was sweating, and with some food in my belly, I didn't feel cold at all. I thought about how I had been riding a tricycle for over twenty years before liberation, often without enough to eat or wear, and being beaten and cursed by the Japanese, traitors, and special agents! Now, the workers have stood up, have enough to eat, and can no longer underestimate themselves. Thinking about this, I felt even more energy in my legs, and I pedaled my empty tricycle swiftly along the quiet road lit by streetlights.

　　As I pedaled to the intersection of Shanxi Road and Siping Road, where it was relatively dark, I suddenly saw a person running towards me from the shadows. As he got closer, I could see his features clearly. He was wearing a blue uniform, his head was shaved, and his eyes were red and wide, like a wild beast. Before I could think of a way to deal with him, he pointed a large gun at my chest and said, "Take me to Yangcun. Avoid any government offices you encounter; if you don't, you won't save my life, and you won't live either!"

　　This happened so suddenly that my mind was a bit confused from the shock, but I quickly cleared my head and thought: This guy must be a reactionary, a bandit. If I take him, I'll die; if I don't take him, I'll also die. There's no one here, I can't control him. I'll take him first and then figure out a way. He got on my tricycle.

　　As I pedaled, my heart was pounding. I thought about suddenly lunging at him and strangling him. Even if I didn't strangle him to death, if I wrestled with him, people would come and catch him. - Because when he got on the tricycle, I thought I saw him put the big gun under his butt - I peeked, no! He was holding a shiny axe to the back of my head! I had to think of another way.

　　When we got to Duolun Road, I turned towards the department store. He said, "No, go straight!" I said, "If you want to go to Yangcun, you should take East Road and go towards Xiaowangzhuang!" He said, "I told you to go straight, just go straight!" I knew this guy was afraid of the Roosevelt Road checkpoint, afraid of being caught.

　　We went along Yong'an Street, all the way to Nanguan Street, where we couldn't pass because the road was under construction, so we turned back. This naturally delayed us further. He got anxious and said, "Hurry up! If it gets light, I won't be able to go, and you won't live either!" I heard his voice was already trembling.

　　At this point, I thought of a plan: I knew this area very well. I could count the public security bureau police stations in that alley even with my eyes closed. As we approached the entrance of an alley, I said, "It's not convenient to go on the main street, let's go through the alley!"

　　He said, "Go wherever you want! Just avoid government offices!" My heart was pounding, and I put all my strength into my legs. The tricycle sped towards the alley!

　　As soon as we turned into the alley entrance, I saw the red light! It was as if I had seen a relative. This guy was dumbfounded. He lowered his voice and asked:

　　"Where are you going?"

　　"We're here!" I shouted loudly, using all the strength I had, and jumped off the tricycle and ran towards the police station.

　　The police, after hearing my report, immediately chased after him. He had already escaped. But based on my report, the police finally caught him on the way to Yangcun.

　　Because I was too traumatized, my body couldn't handle it. Comrade Xu Shuming from the Sixth Branch of the Sixth Branch of the Union learned about it and immediately came to my house to see me and gave me a thousand yuan for wine to calm my nerves. Then, he and Comrade Wang Jinsheng, director of the Sixth Branch of the Sixth Branch of the Union, helped me to the Fourth Hospital to see a doctor, completely free of charge. The next day, the Union also sent me a subsidy of one hundred thousand yuan, telling me to rest for a few more days before going back to work. This made me feel the love of the working class and the government's care for me. Now, I have long since returned to work. However, I've developed a chronic illness, and I sweat profusely every night. I think it will be cured soon.

　　Bandits and special agents are really hateful. With them around, we can't live a good life. I think about how I couldn't even get enough sweet potato noodles in the past, and when I came home, I didn't even have a blanket! Now that the people have stood up, who wants to go back to that kind of animal-like life.

　　I laugh when I think of the special agent's words, "You won't save my life, and you won't live either." If he hadn't already been shot, I could tell him, "I can't save your life either!" I can't save your life because you are a heinous reactionary; with you around, we can't live a good life. We people intend to live well, so we must actively cooperate with the government to severely suppress you bandits and special agents!

### 我协助政府捉住特务

　　我协助政府捉住特务
    天津三轮车工人　尚广和
    编者按：上月十三日在天津经公审后伏法的吴匪存卓，是潜伏工厂内部谋杀我干部和职工的反革命罪犯。以下这篇通讯，是天津三轮车工人尚广和叙述吴匪在行凶后潜逃时，他怎样协助公安局捕捉吴匪的情形。
    我是“蹬早”的，那天早晨五点钟就出了车，拉完了一趟座，打耀华里往回放，天还黑着，刮着西北风。我因为蹬得急了些，身上透了汗，再加上肚子里有饭，一点也不觉得冷，我想起解放前蹬了二十多年车，常是吃不饱，穿不暖，受鬼子、汉奸、特务们的打骂！现在呢！工人翻了身，有了饱饭吃，再不能小看自己了，想着想着，腿上更有了劲，我蹬着空车在闪着路灯的静静的马路上飞跑着。
    蹬到山西路四平道口，地方比较暗，我突然看见一个人从黑影里奔着我跑过来，临近了，我才看清楚这个人的形象，他穿着蓝制服，光着头，两个眼睛都红了，瞪得滚圆，活像一匹野兽。还没有等我想出对付他的办法，他已经用大枪对着我的胸口说：“你拉我到杨村去，凡碰到机关的地方你给我躲开；你不躲，救不了我的命，你也活不了！”
    这件事太突然了，因为受惊过甚，我的脑子有些乱，但马上又清醒了，心想：这小子一定是反动派，土匪，我拉他，是个死，不拉他也是个死，这儿没人，治不了他，先拉上他再想办法吧。他上了我的车。
    蹬着车，我的心直跳，我想冷不防扑过去，掐死他，就是掐不死，和他滚起来，一会儿有了人，也会捉住他。——因为他上车的时候我仿佛见他把大枪压在屁股底下了——偷偷一看，不成！他举着一把明晃晃的斧子对着我的后脑呢！只好想别的办法。
    走到多伦道，转奔百货公司，他说：“不成，照直走！”我说：“你到杨村去应该走东马路，奔小王庄才对！”他说：“叫你照直走，你就照直走！”我知道这小子是怕罗斯福路有岗，怕捉住他。
    走到永安大街，一直到南关街，那里因为修马路通不过，又拐回来。自然又延迟了一个时候，他急了，说：“快走！天亮了我走不了，你也活不了！”我听见他的声音已经有些打颤了。
    这时我想起了一个办法：因为这一带我非常熟悉，那个胡同有公安局的派出所，我闭上眼睛都能数得出来，快走到一个胡同口的时候，我就说：“大街上走不方便，从胡同走吧！”
    他说：“随便你走！没有机关的地方就成！”我的心跳得厉害，腿上叫了劲，车子飞也似地向胡同里跑去！
    一拐进胡同口，就看见了红灯！我好像见了亲人，这小子可傻了，他压低着嗓子问：
    “你到那去？”
    “到了！”我大声喊了一句，把吃奶的力量都使出来，猛地跳下车子，就向派出所跑。
    警察听了我的报告，马上追出去，他已经逃了。但派出所根据我的报告，终于把他从去杨村的途中捉住了。
    我因为受的刺激太大，身体有些不能支持，工会第六分会六支会的许树铭同志知道了，马上到家里来看我，给我打了一千块钱的酒压惊。然后又和六分会六支会主任王金升同志一同扶我到第四医院去看病，完全免费，转天工会还给我送来十万元的补助费，叫我多休养几天再出车。使我感到工人阶级的友爱和政府对我的照顾。现在我早已出车了。不过，我落了一个病根，每天夜里出虚汗。我想不久就会治好的。
    土匪、特务实在可恶，有了他们，咱们就不能过好日子。想想我过去连山芋面都吃不饱，一进屋，连床被都没有！现在人民翻身了，谁还想再过从前那样牛马的日子。
    我想起那个特务所说的“救不了我的命，你也活不了”那句话就发笑。要不是已经枪毙了他，我可以和他说：“是救不了你的命！”我也不能救你的命！因为你是罪大恶极的反动派；有了你们，我们就不能过好日子。我们人民打算活得好，就必须主动配合政府行动严厉镇压你们这些匪徒特务！
