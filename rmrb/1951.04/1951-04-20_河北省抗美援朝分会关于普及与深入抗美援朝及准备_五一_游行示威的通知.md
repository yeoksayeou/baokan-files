　　Notice from the Hebei Provincial Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association on Popularizing and Deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement and Preparing for the May 1st Parade and Demonstration

　　In order to popularize and deepen the patriotic propaganda and education work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and to achieve the goal of making every place and everyone in the province receive patriotic education of resisting America and aiding Korea, according to the circular of the China People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, and in combination with the situation in our province, we hereby notify as follows:

　　I. It is recommended that all localities, according to their local conditions, further popularize and deepen the patriotic propaganda work of resisting America and aiding Korea in a planned and focused manner. Wherever such propaganda is not widespread enough, popularization work should be grasped immediately. The key areas for popularization are mainly mountainous areas, disaster areas, and remote small villages in the plains; the targets are mainly religious circles, housewives, and the elderly. All localities should use various methods to eliminate the above-mentioned blank spots in the patriotic propaganda of resisting America and aiding Korea. Where the patriotic propaganda of resisting America and aiding Korea has been widely carried out, work should continue to be deepened, focusing on regular and systematic patriotic propaganda to further raise the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, and strive to make this propaganda exist for a long time.

　　II. At present, the central content of patriotic propaganda in resisting America and aiding Korea should be:

　　1. Oppose the rearmament of Japan by the United States, specifically expose the rearmament of Japan by the United States and its insurmountable difficulties, and point out our determination and significance to strive for a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and make Japan a peaceful and democratic country.

　　2. Mobilize the broad masses of people to continue to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and take improving production, doing revolutionary work well, and studying hard as practical actions to support them.

　　3. Support the resolution of the World Peace Council, focusing on publicizing the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace covenant by the five major powers, and actively mobilize the masses to enthusiastically sign their names to express their support. Mobilize the people to strive for the realization of the various resolutions of the World Peace Council with practical actions.

　　4. In the above-mentioned propaganda, it is necessary to prominently link the propaganda on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries with the patriotic production competition carried out by workers and the patriotic bumper harvest movement of farmers. Arouse hatred for the Kuomintang and U.S. special agents - counter-revolutionary elements - from the recollections and accusations of the masses, and call on the masses to assist the government in thoroughly implementing the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries. Call on workers to learn from the Ma Hengchang team. Call on farmers to learn from Zhang Xishun, and mutual aid groups in various places to respond to Li Shunda's challenge, actively prepare for spring plowing, plant more cotton, and strive to achieve the task of increasing grain and cotton production.

　　Doing a good job in spring plowing production (especially cotton planting in the south) and suppressing counter-revolutionaries are the central tasks that all our current propaganda work must revolve around. Throughout the entire movement, we require people from all walks of life to correctly understand the current situation, further strengthen their confidence in victory, and continue to improve and consolidate their patriotic enthusiasm for resisting America and aiding Korea, so as to achieve the goal of workers and farmers increasing production, all cadres and personnel doing their jobs well, students studying hard, businessmen actively exchanging materials, and people from all walks of life more actively assisting the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. The establishment and effective implementation of patriotic covenants are guarantees for achieving the above-mentioned goals. Therefore, all towns, trades, sectors, organs, groups, enterprises, schools, factories, and vast rural areas that have not established patriotic covenants should be universally established; those that have been established should be inspected to gradually realize them. In this regard, the leadership must specifically grasp and correctly guide. In order to improve and give play to the patriotic enthusiasm of the people in resisting America and aiding Korea, all localities must hold a signature campaign for the declaration of supporting the conclusion of a peace covenant by the five major powers and a public opinion vote against the rearmament of Japan by the United States at accusation meetings or other gatherings (for the sake of simplicity, raising hands can be used instead of signing and voting, and the convener will count the number of people and report it). The above-mentioned work of establishing covenants, etc., should be carried out in one meeting to reduce the meeting time for the masses.

　　III. Correct use of strength and full ideological mobilization are the main keys to popularizing and deepening the patriotic propaganda of resisting America and aiding Korea, and should be highly valued. Cities and towns can universally convene representative conferences for resisting America and aiding Korea, study and formulate plans for popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, and implement them to the villages in early April. All localities can use all gatherings, with responsible comrades making reports on the situation and tasks, and mobilizing a large number of cadres to mobilize and organize people from all walks of life to strive to complete the propaganda tasks of popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, doing a good job in production, and eliminating counter-revolutionaries. To this end, we recommend that people's organizations, organs, factories, and propaganda, education, and cultural institutions at all levels should formulate their own system and unit's propaganda plan, and effectively implement it to their subordinates. Teachers and students of schools above the senior elementary level and various learning organizations such as training classes, as well as all elementary school teachers, can use their spare time to carry out various propaganda activities on resisting America and aiding Korea to the people, and before May 1st, they can take out one day of the week to carry out a large-scale propaganda.

　　It is recommended that newspapers, radio stations, propaganda and education departments, and various literary and art groups vigorously provide various propaganda materials. Reporters and propagandists should actively carry out activities.

　　All localities can widely organize various small forums according to their existing experience and local conditions, and use various forms of propaganda to widely publicize. In various public places, such as factories, shops, schools, hotels, parks, stations, and markets, maps of Korea, current affairs pictures, current situation briefings, etc., can be posted in a planned manner to create a strong atmosphere of resisting America and aiding Korea. Launching mass recollections and accusations, and guiding hatred for Chiang and Japan to American imperialism and counter-revolutionary elements, is an important method of educating and inspiring the masses. This method should be vigorously promoted, and places that have not held recollections and accusations should hold them universally.

　　On May 1st Labor Day, parades and demonstrations will be held universally in urban and rural areas throughout the province, and all localities should vigorously mobilize the masses to actively participate. In urban areas, workers are the main body to mobilize people from all walks of life to participate, and in rural areas, we strive for the participation of all farmers. Because villages in rural areas are scattered, methods of joint holding by several villages can be adopted to ensure that every village sees the parade team, but it is also necessary to take care of the masses so that they are not too tired (remote and distant mountain villages and disaster areas and water towns cannot gather to parade, they can hold mass meetings and parades in their own villages). In order to make the May 1st parade and demonstration achieve the goal of fully educating the masses, it is necessary to do a good job in a series of organizational work and in-depth mobilization work: In early April, rural areas should form temporary parade headquarters in the district to uniformly lead the preparations for the parade; each large parade unit must set up assembly points and parade areas, and be led by a district cadre, and the parade teams of each village must be led by the main cadres of the village; cities organize pickets, and rural areas can organize the use of militia to protect the safety of the parade team. The meaning of the parade and demonstration should be explained to the paraders in advance, and the uniformly formulated patriotic songs of resisting America and aiding Korea should be taught (the songs are determined, and there will be another notice). In order to make the preparations for the parade fully and meticulously, a serious inspection should be carried out before May 1st. In order to stimulate the political enthusiasm of the parading masses and maintain their full emotions, the parading masses can hold meetings of no more than one hour after gathering and before the start of the parade, and make short speeches to the parading masses. The content of the speeches should link the general political slogans with the propaganda of the current specific tasks, and announce the matters that should be paid attention to during the parade.

　　IV. Resist America, Aid Korea Associations at all levels should become a powerful leading organizer of this movement. Those above the county level who do not yet have such organizers should be established quickly. In this movement, the Resist America, Aid Korea Association can set up a special person to be responsible for carrying out the work. Resist America, Aid Korea Associations at all levels must establish a work system for timely reporting of situations at each level, so that the leading organs can timely direct the development of the movement.

　　Before April 20th, all cadres who have left production can conduct one to two weeks of current affairs study according to the propaganda points issued by the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, with reference to other documents (the specific time can be determined by each locality). Various schools at all levels must also organize appropriate study. During this period, various methods should be mainly adopted to carry out decentralized propaganda activities to the masses. After April 20th and before May 1st, we should try to use the production gaps of the masses to convene various small symposiums to carry out more centralized propaganda activities. The propaganda work before May 1st is the preparation for the May 1st parade. If the propaganda work is done well in advance, the May 1st parade and demonstration will inevitably be done well. We must fully grasp this and strictly prevent the phenomenon of coercion and command that may occur in organizing and mobilizing the masses to participate in the parade and demonstration.

　　After receiving this notice, Resist America, Aid Korea Associations at all levels should immediately conduct specific research and deployment, in order to create a new upsurge in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement before May 1st. After the May 1st parade, a summary report should be made to the branch, and the patriotic propaganda of resisting America and aiding Korea should be transformed into a regular task.

　　河北省抗美援朝分会关于普及与深入抗美援朝及准备“五一”游行示威的通知
    为普及和深入抗美援朝爱国主义的宣传教育工作，达到全省每处每人都受到抗美援朝爱国教育的目的，根据中国人民抗美援朝总会通告，结合本省情况，通知如下：
    一、建议各地根据本地情况，有计划有重点地进一步普及和深入抗美援朝的爱国宣传工作，凡是这种宣传不够普遍的地方，应即抓紧普及工作。普及的重点地区，主要是山区、灾区及平原地区的偏僻小村；对象则主要是宗教界、家庭妇女和老年人。各地应运用各种方法，消灭上述抗美援朝爱国宣传上的空白点。凡已普遍开展了抗美援朝爱国宣传的地方，即应继续深入工作，着重经常性系统性的爱国主义宣传，把群众的爱国热情更加提高一步，并努力使这种宣传长期存在下去。
    二、目前抗美援朝的爱国宣传，其中心内容应是：
    １、反对美国重新武装日本，具体揭露美国重新武装日本及其不易克服的困难，指出我们争取全面对日和约和使日本成为和平民主国家的决心与意义。
    ２、动员广大人民继续支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，以提高生产、作好革命工作、努力学习等作为支援他们的实际行动。
    ３、拥护世界和平理事会决议，着重宣传世界和平理事会关于五大国缔结和平公约的宣言，并积极动员人民群众热烈签名表示拥护。发动人民以实际行动为实现世界和平理事会的各项决议而奋斗。
    ４、在上述宣传中，必须突出地联系宣传镇压反革命问题和工人开展爱国主义生产竞赛及农民的爱国丰产运动。从群众回忆控诉中引起对蒋、美特务爪牙——反革命分子的仇恨，号召人民群众协助政府彻底贯彻惩治反革命条例。号召工人向马恒昌小组学习。号召农民向张希顺学习，各地互助组向李顺达应战，积极作好春耕准备工作，多种棉花，为实现增产粮、棉任务而奋斗。
    作好春耕生产（在南部特别是种棉）与镇压反革命是我们当前进行一切宣传工作必须围绕的中心。整个运动中要求各阶层人民群众正确认识目前形势，更加坚定胜利信心，继续提高与巩固抗美援朝的爱国热情，以达到工人农民提高生产、所有干部人员作好工作、学生努力学习、商人努力交流物资、各阶层人民更加积极地协助政府镇压反革命的目的。而爱国公约的订立与有效的实施，又是实现上述目的之保证。因此各城镇、各行、各界、各机关团体、企业、学校、工厂及广大乡村凡未订立爱国公约者，应普遍订立；已订者应予检查，求其逐步实现。对此，领导上须具体掌握，正确指导。为提高与发挥人民群众抗美援朝的爱国热情，各地必须在控诉会或其他集会上，举行关于拥护缔结五大国和平公约宣言的签名和反对美国重新武装日本的民意投票（为简便计，可以举手代替签名与投票，由召集人统计人数上报）。上述订公约等工作，争取在一次会议上进行，以减少群众开会时间。
    三、正确使用力量与充分的思想动员，是普及和深入开展抗美援朝爱国宣传的主要关键，应该十分重视。市、镇可普遍召开抗美援朝代表会议，研究并订立普及和深入抗美援朝运动的方案，于四月上旬贯彻到村。各地可利用一切集会，由负责同志做关于形势和任务的报告，发动广大干部动员组织各阶层人民群众，为完成普及和深入抗美援朝运动，做好生产、肃清反革命的宣传任务而努力。为此，我们建议各级人民团体、机关、工厂，和各宣传教育文化机构等都应订出自己系统和本单位的宣传计划，并切实下达到所属人员。高小以上的学校及训练班等各种学习组织的教员、学生及全体小学教员，可利用课余时间对人民群众做关于抗美援朝的各种宣传活动，“五一”前并抽出一个礼拜日进行一次规模较大的宣传。
    建议报纸、广播电台、宣教部门及各文艺团体，大力供给各种宣传材料。报告员宣传员应积极活动。
    各地可根据已有经验和本地条件，广泛组织各种小型座谈，利用各种宣传形式，广为宣传。在各种公共场合，如工厂、商店、学校、旅馆、公园、车站、集市等可有计划地张贴朝鲜地图、时事图画、时局简报等，造成抗美援朝的浓厚空气。发动群众性的回忆控诉，把对蒋、日的仇恨，引导到美国帝国主义和反革命分子身上，更是教育群众激发群众斗志的重要方法。此种方式应大力推广，凡未举行过回忆控诉的地方，都要普遍举行。
    “五一”劳动节全省城乡普遍举行游行示威，各地应大力动员群众踊跃参加。在城镇以工人为主体动员各阶层人民参加，在农村则争取全体农民参加。农村因村庄分散，可采取数村联合举行的方法，务使村村见到游行队伍，但又须照顾群众不使之过于疲劳（偏僻与距离过远的山村和灾区、水乡无法集合游行者，可在本村举行群众大会与游行）。为使“五一”游行示威达到充分教育群众的目的，须做好一系列的组织工作与深入的动员工作：四月上旬农村应组成区临时性的游行指挥部，统一领导筹备游行事宜；每一大的游行单位，须定好集合点及游行区域，并由一区干部指挥带领，各村游行队伍则须由村主要干部带领；城市组织纠察队，农村可组织使用民兵，以保卫游行队伍的安全。对游行者要事先讲清游行示威的意义，教会统一制定的抗美援朝的爱国歌曲（歌子确定，另有通知）。为使游行的准备工作，做到充分和周密，“五一”前应进行一次认真的检查。为激发游行群众的政治热情与保持饱满的情绪，游行群众集中后，开始游行前，均可举行不超过一小时的会议，向游行群众做简短的讲话，讲话内容应把一般的政治口号和当前具体任务的宣传联系起来，并宣布游行时应注意的事项。
    四、各级抗美援朝会应成为这一运动的有力领导组织者。县以上尚无此种组织者应迅速建立。在此运动中抗美援朝会可设专人负责，进行工作。各级抗美援朝会要建立及时的逐级上报情况的工作制度，以使领导机关及时指挥运动的开展。
    四月二十日以前所有脱离生产的干部，可按中共河北省委宣传部制发的宣传要点，参照其他文件，进行一周到两周的时事学习（具体时间各地可自订），各级各种学校亦须组织适当的学习。在此期间对群众主要采取各种方法进行分散的宣传活动。四月二十日以后“五一”以前，则尽量利用群众生产空隙召开各种小型座谈会议，进行较为集中的宣传活动。“五一”前的宣传工作是“五一”游行的准备，事先宣传工作做得好，“五一”的游行示威就必然会做好，对此要充分掌握，严格防止在组织与动员群众参加游行示威中可能发生的强迫命令现象。
    各级抗美援朝会接此通知后应即进行具体的研究与部署，以期“五一”节前使抗美援朝运动有一个新的高潮。“五一”游行后要作出总结报告分会。并把抗美援朝的爱国宣传转为经常性的任务。
