　　Nanchang People's Court
　　Protects State Property Through Notarization Work
　　From August 1949 to November 1950, the Nanchang People's Court accepted a total of 83 cases endangering state property. These mainly involved government agencies and military logistics departments signing contracts with private merchants for processing, ordering goods, and bidding on construction projects. The private merchants breached the contracts, defrauded funds, and even stole public property, causing serious losses to state property and affecting national economic construction. For example, private merchants Zhang Zhiyuan and others exchanged rice for firewood, owing 2.28 million catties of wood. Yuanlong and eight other rice mills stole nearly a million catties of public grain. Wu Beihai and three other households, contracted to purchase bricks for the railway bureau, failed to deliver the goods, seriously affecting the railway construction project.

　　According to statistics from the court, in the six months of March, April, June, July, August, and October of last year, the state lost more than 2.5 million catties of rice and over 100 million RMB due to breaches of contract by private merchants. These types of cases were time-consuming to investigate and difficult to recover losses from, greatly increasing the difficulty of the court's adjudication work.

　　The reasons for the above cases were, on the one hand, due to insufficient supervision and management by government agencies, negligence, and inadequate review of contracting private merchants and lax procedures. However, the main reason was that some private merchants continued the speculative and profiteering practices of the Kuomintang era to defraud the People's Government, thereby causing undue losses to state property.

　　In response to the above situation, the Nanchang People's Court began a new notarization service in November of last year, stipulating that "All contracts signed between public entities and private individuals... should be transferred to this court for notarization after being signed by both parties and the guarantor. Otherwise, in case of accidents, it will not be accepted." Through this measure, the Nanchang People's Court has shifted from passive punishment to active prevention in eliminating cases endangering state property. This has played a significant role in raising the vigilance of contracting agencies and preventing illegal acts by speculative merchants. From November to the end of December last year, a total of 105 notarization cases were accepted, and 70 were concluded, including 51 notarizations and 19 rejections. Because the court strictly reviews the contractors and guarantors in notarization cases, and stipulates the prohibition of guarantees from the same industry, mutual guarantees, and guarantees whose value exceeds the guarantor's own funds, the contracting agencies must also conduct their own reviews before submitting to the court for notarization. No problems have arisen with contracts that have been notarized.

　　Based on the experience of the Nanchang People's Court, the Central South Military and Political Committee has decided to pilot the establishment of the same system in major cities in the region. The experience of the Nanchang People's Court in establishing new notarization work has also attracted the attention of the central judicial leadership organs.

### 南昌市人民法院通过公证工作保护国家财产

　　南昌市人民法院
　  通过公证工作保护国家财产
    从一九四九年八月至一九五○年十一月，南昌市人民法院共受理了危害国家财产案八十三件。其中主要是政府机关及军队后勤机关与私商订立加工、订货、招标建筑等合同等，私商违约骗款，甚至盗卖公物，使国家财产遭受严重损失，影响国家经济建设。如私商张志远等领米换柴，亏欠木柴达二百二十八万斤，元隆等八家米厂盗卖公粮近百万斤，吴北海等三户代铁路局购砖不交货，严重影响了铁路的建设事业。
    据该院统计，去年三、四、六、七、八、十月六个月中，公家因私商违约即损失大米二百五十多万斤，人民币一亿多元。此类案件，清理费时，追赔不易，大大增加了法院审理工作的困难。
    造成上述案件的原因，一方面固然由于政府机关对此类工作监督管理不够，麻痹大意，对承揽私商审查不周，手续不严，但主要还是一些私商沿袭国民党时代投机倒把作风来欺诈人民政府，因而造成国家财产不应有的损失。
    针对以上情况，南昌市人民法院于去年十一月开始了新的公证业务，规定：“凡公家与私人订立之契约，……双方当事人及保证人签押后，应将原契约移送本院公证，否则发生意外事故，不予受理。”通过这种措施，该市人民法院对消灭危害国家财产案件，乃由消极惩罚转入积极预防。这对提高订约机关的警惕和杜塞投机商人的不法行为，起了很大作用。自去年十一月至十二月底止，共受理公证案件一百零五件，已结七十件，其中公证五十一件，驳回十九件。由于该法院对公证案件的承揽者、保证商进行严格审查，并规定禁止同业作保、互相作保及保证价值超过本身资金额等，订约机关，亦须由其负责自行审查后，始得送法院公证。经过公证的合同，尚未出过岔子。
    中南军政委员会根据南昌市人民法院的经验，已决定要在该区各大城市试行建立同样制度。南昌市人民法院建立新公证工作的经验，并已引起中央司法领导机关的注意。
