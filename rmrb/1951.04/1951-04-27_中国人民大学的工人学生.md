　　Worker Students of Renmin University of China
    Cheng Fangwu, Vice President of Renmin University of China
    In the old China under reactionary rule, there was never such a thing as workers going to university. The universities of old China built a high and thick iron curtain against the working class, making it absolutely impossible to enter. Of course, those universities were also built with the blood and sweat of the workers, but this was only so that the children of the rich could happily learn a set of skills to maintain their rule in the future, that is, to firmly oppress the workers.

    The Chinese people's revolution led by the Communist Party realized the right to education for Chinese workers from the time the revolutionary base areas were established. However, in those past days, we did not have many higher education institutions, and workers only participated in some training course-type political and military schools, and were not able to receive long-term formal higher education.

    The opening of Renmin University of China began a new era of worker education, so it is indeed a great happy event for the Chinese working class. When the news spread that Renmin University of China was about to be established and decided to enroll worker students, workers from some places began to rush to sign up, and even in some places workers held meetings and sent representatives to study at the school. Of course, today our country has only been established for a short time, Taiwan and Tibet are still waiting for liberation, and American imperialism has launched a war of aggression against Korea. With resisting America and aiding Korea becoming an urgent task for the people of the whole country, we cannot use greater strength to absorb a large number of worker students. At present, we are only absorbing a small number of young workers with a certain level of education to study, and learn from their studies.

    Last February, 136 worker students were enrolled in undergraduate programs, and in October, 27 were enrolled in specialized courses. These students began to study actively as soon as they arrived at the school, and their efforts are remarkable. Because they realize that coming to Renmin University of China to study is a glorious task given to them by the Communist Party, given to them by the working class, and given to them by the people, in order to build a new country, a new society, and to cultivate the backbone of the working class in construction, and without the strong backbone of the working class, construction cannot be successful. At the same time, they deeply understand from personal experience that they have gained the right to go to university because the working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party, has turned over and become the leading class of the country, and because of the countless revolutionary martyrs who have stepped forward and struggled heroically. Illusions that could not be realized in the past have become vivid realities today. Therefore, they cherish today's learning very much. They love the school and every staff member and classmate. They cheer up and study hard. "One day should be used as three days," "Only learn well, not learn badly," they demand of themselves in this way.

    The things to be learned are brand new and unfamiliar, and there are difficulties everywhere, but they say, "No task of the Party has ever been impossible to complete in the past, and the difficulties in learning today must be overcome." Therefore, they seize all the time, overcome all kinds of difficulties, and study tenaciously. These worker comrades, whose average cultural level is equivalent to that of a senior elementary school graduate, have brought into play the spirit of hard study and research, and have "broken through" and "mastered" political theory courses such as Marxism-Leninism, political economy, and the history of the Chinese revolution, as well as cultural courses such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, drawing, and Russian, all of which they had never heard of before, one after another, lesson after lesson. At the same time, they are good at connecting with reality, and can apply what they have learned immediately.

    Worker students not only have a high degree of enthusiasm for learning and a tenacious spirit of research, but they also have other advantages or characteristics. Based on preliminary materials, the following points can be cited:

    First of all, political enthusiasm: worker students are most concerned about political activities. Last year, when the school mobilized cadres to join the Volunteer Army to Resist America and Aid Korea, worker students all requested permission to sign up; when selecting students for military cadre schools, all young workers responded to the call the fastest, and everyone insisted that they were fully qualified. Some said, "I am reluctant to leave Renmin University, and I am willing to become an expert after studying, but when imperialism invades our country, I will not hesitate to go to the forefront of national defense." In other activities such as street propaganda, paying New Year's greetings to the families of soldiers, and comforting the soldiers at the front, worker students are the most active. Everyone knows that Comrade Li Fenglian, despite the heavy burden of her studies, never relaxes her work in the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and would rather not rest at all to catch up with her studies. Worker students absolutely believe in the Communist Party and support the Communist Party. At the same time, they are aware of their glorious and arduous responsibilities. These are the sources of the worker students' high political enthusiasm.

    Organization and discipline: Worker students are the best at abiding by school rules, adhering to various systems, and obeying leadership. In daily study and life, they always do what they should do, step by step, on time, and arrive at class on time. They work together with one heart and one mind, and there is no laxity; therefore, they appear neat, lively, and happy, and their work is easy to promote. This kind of conscious organization and discipline is precisely one of the characteristics of the proletariat, "a certain historical class created, organized, united, educated, inspired and tempered by large-scale capitalism" (Lenin's Selected Works, Two-Volume Edition, Moscow Chinese Edition, Volume II, "The Great Initiative"), as Lenin said. Our worker students are typical of this feature.

    Mutual assistance and friendship: Although worker students are busy with their own studies, when there are individual students with difficulties, everyone automatically and voluntarily helps them so that they can keep up. For example, Comrade Jin Xiuling, a female worker, had only studied in elementary school for five years in the past. It was already difficult enough to take notes and read reference books. In addition, because she was elected as a representative to attend the Second World Student Congress in Prague, she missed more than two months of classes, and the difficulties were even greater. However, the worker classmates made a plan, one person helping with one subject, and she herself put in more effort than others. As a result, she got an "excellent" in one subject in the semester exam, and all the others were "good". Another example is Comrade Lin Chuanquan, who has been working for eighteen years and has many difficulties, but thanks to the patient help of group leader Comrade Qi Zuozhi (lathe worker) and other classmates, coupled with his own amazing efforts, he got mostly "excellent" and "good" grades in the semester exam.

    Fighting spirit: Studying tenaciously, never complaining, always working hard, and trying to overcome difficulties. These can already be seen from the examples cited above. At the same time, there is a good spirit of criticism among worker classmates. If errors or shortcomings are found, they can immediately launch mutual criticism. For example, if someone is not respectful enough to the teacher, everyone will stand up and criticize him. If someone only cares about their own good learning and is unwilling to help others, they will also be criticized. Worker students are very united, but their unity is principled.

    No ideological burden: Worker students are very focused on learning, their will is concentrated, and they do not let personal or family problems affect their learning. For example, some comrades have very difficult family lives, but they always try their best to overcome them and never affect their enthusiasm for learning, because they see that the country is still in a difficult period and cannot only take care of themselves. Also, for example, those who do well in their studies are never complacent, and those who do poorly are never pessimistic. From these places, we can also see the firm, optimistic, and simple characteristics of the working class.

    The above are some important characteristics of worker students. But they have one of the most serious shortcomings, that is, their cultural level cannot keep up with their needs. For example, their general knowledge of culture is low, which often hinders their deeper and broader understanding of various subjects. Their Chinese language level often makes it impossible for them to write as they wish. This is indeed their great difficulty. According to such specific circumstances, Renmin University of China has established cultural remedial classes to allow those worker students and revolutionary cadres whose cultural level is too low to first make up for cultural courses for one or two years. At the same time, teachers also use all possible time to tutor these students with low cultural levels.

    Although workers do have cultural difficulties, they can learn as well as revolutionary cadres and young intellectuals in their studies, and workers also have some favorable conditions. Generally speaking, in terms of political experience, workers are not as good as veteran cadres, but because of their class characteristics, workers have personally experienced various political and economic oppressions, so when studying political theory courses, they are as easy to go deep and are stronger than young intellectuals. In terms of culture, workers are worse than young intellectuals, but stronger than some veteran cadres, especially those who are younger and have better memories. In addition, workers have a certain knowledge of industrial production, and they are easier to understand when learning certain technical courses. "In the past, I could do the work, but I couldn't explain the reason," which is what veteran cadres and young intellectuals generally lack. The results of the first semester exams for undergraduates showed that none of the workers failed; several or dozens of veteran cadres and young intellectuals failed. And the average scores of these three types of students are all above four points, almost equal. (4.22:4.23:4.32). In fact, worker students have made great progress after several months to a year of study. They have learned political theory and professional skills very well, and their cultural level has also improved significantly. There are not many difficulties anymore. Therefore, worker students have great potential for cultivation, and the Central People's Government's decision for Renmin University of China to enroll worker students is completely correct.

    Renmin University of China is now preparing to extend the study period of the finance and economics departments from three years to four years, and mainly make up for some cultural courses in the first academic year, which will make it easier for workers and revolutionary cadres to study. If worker-peasant middle schools in various places are quickly established in the future, our country will be able to absorb a large number of worker students into universities, cultivate tens of thousands of worker experts, and a new type of intellectuals from worker backgrounds, so that the mighty ranks of construction cadres in our country will have the strong backbone of powerful worker cadres, ensuring the successful construction of our great motherland. Such days will not be far away.

　　中国人民大学的工人学生
    中国人民大学副校长  成仿吾
    在反动统治下的旧中国，从来没有过工人上大学念书的事情。旧中国的大学对工人阶级筑下了一道又高又厚的铜墙铁壁，是绝对无法进去的。当然，那些大学也是工人们流血流汗盖起来的，不过这只是为了有钱人的子弟能够很愉快地学会一套本事，将来好维持他们的统治，也就是说，稳稳地压在工人们的头上。
    共产党领导的中国人民革命，从有了革命根据地起，就为中国工人实现了受教育的权利。但是，在过去了的那些日子，我们还没有很多的高等教育机关，工人们只是参加了一些训练班性质的政治军事学校，还没有能够受到长时间的正规的高等教育。
    中国人民大学的开办，开始了工人教育的新的时期，因此，对于中国工人阶级的确是一件大喜事。当中国人民大学将要成立并决定招收工人学生的消息传出以后，有些地方的工人就开始赶来报名，甚至有的地方工人们开了会，推出了代表来校学习。当然，今天我们的国家刚刚成立不久，台湾西藏还等待解放，美帝国主义又对朝鲜发动了侵略战争，抗美援朝成为全国人民的迫切任务的时候，我们还不可能用更大的力量来大量吸收工人学生。目前我们还只是吸收不多的，有一定文化程度的青年工人来学习，从他们的学习中来吸取经验。
    去年二月本科招收了一百三十六名工人学生，十月专修科又招收了二十七名。这些学生一到学校就开始积极地学习，他们的努力是显著的。因为他们认识到自己来中国人民大学学习，是共产党交给他们的，工人阶级交给他们的，人民交给他们的光荣的任务，是为了建设新的国家，新的社会，为了培养工人阶级在建设中的骨干，而没有工人阶级的坚强骨干，建设是不可能成功的。同时他们由亲身的经验深深地懂得，他们取得了上大学念书的权利，是由于工人阶级在共产党领导下翻了身，成了国家的领导阶级，由于无数的革命先烈前仆后继、英勇奋斗的结果。往日无法实现的幻想，今天成了活生生的现实。因此，他们非常珍惜今天的学习。他们热爱学校，热爱每一个工作人员与同学。他们鼓起劲来学习。“一天要当三天用”，“只能学好，不能学坏”，他们这样要求自己。
    学习的东西是崭新的、陌生的，困难到处都有，但是他们这样说，“党的任务过去没有不能完成的，今天学习上的困难一定要克服。”因此，他们抓紧一切时间，克服各种困难，顽强地学习着。平均文化水平相当于高小毕业的这些工人同志，由于发挥了刻苦钻研的精神，把马克思列宁主义、政治经济学、中国革命史等政治理论课，数学、物理、化学、制图、俄文等文化课，把这些从来没有听到过的学问，一门又一门，一课又一课地“突破”了，“弄通”了。同时他们联系实际好，学到的东西，能够马上应用。
    工人学生不仅有高度的学习热情与顽强的钻研精神，他们还有其他的一些优点或特色。根据初步的材料，就可以举出以下几点：
    首先是政治热情：工人学生对政治活动是最关心的。去年学校动员干部参加抗美援朝志愿部队的时候，工人学生都要求准许报名；选派军事干部学校学员的时候，全体青年工人响应号召最快，大家都主张自己完全合条件，有的说，“我留恋人民大学，愿意学成一个专家，但是当帝国主义侵略我们国家的时候，我毫不迟疑地走上国防的最前线”。其他如街头宣传，给抗属拜年，慰劳前方将士，工人学生都是最积极的。大家知道的李凤莲同志，尽管功课负担那样重，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会与中华全国民主妇女联合会等处的工作总不放松，宁愿全不休息来赶功课。工人学生绝对相信共产党，拥护共产党。同时觉悟到自己的光荣而艰巨的责任，这些就是工人学生的高度政治热情的来源。
    组织性，纪律性：工人学生遵守学校规则、坚持各种制度、服从领导，是最好的。在日常学习与生活中，他们总是该做什么就做什么，按步就班，按时作息，准时到课，干起活来齐心合力，没有散漫现象；因此，他们显得整齐、活泼、愉快，他们中间的工作好推动。这种自觉的组织性与纪律性，正是列宁所说的“大资本主义所创造、组织、团结、训练、启发和锻炼出来的一定的历史阶级”（列宁文选两卷集、莫斯科中文版、下卷、“伟大的创举”）——无产阶级的本性之一。我们的这些工人学生正是富有这种特色的典型。
    互助友爱：工人学生虽然每个人都忙于自己的学习，但是有个别困难的同学时，大家就自动自愿地给以帮助，使他也能够跟上。比如女工金秀玲同志过去只读过五年小学，记笔记、看参考书等本来已够困难，又因为当选代表到布拉格出席世界学生第二届代表大会，缺课两个多月，困难是更多的。但是工人同学们大家做计划，一人帮助一门，加上她自己付出比别人更大的努力，结果学期考试时一门“优”，其他都是“良”。又比如做过十八年工的林春泉同志实在有很多的困难，但是由于组长齐佐治同志（旋盘工）和其他同学的耐心帮助，加上自己的惊人的努力，学期考试大部分是“优”与“良”。
    斗争精神：顽强地学习，从来不叫苦，总是刻苦努力，想办法克服困难。这些已可以从上面所举的例子看到。同时工人同学间有一种很好的批评精神。如果发现了错误或缺点，能够立刻展开互相间的批评。比如有人对教师不够尊重，大家就起来批评他。如果只管个人学习好，不肯帮助别人，也会受到批评的。工人学生间非常团结，但是他们的团结是有原则的。
    没有思想负担：工人学生对学习非常专心，意志集中，不因为个人的或家庭的问题而影响学习。比如有的同志家庭生活实在很困难，但总是尽力设法克服，从不影响学习热情，因为他们看到国家还在困难的时期，不能只顾自己。又比如学习中功课好的从不自满，差的决不悲观。从这些地方也可以看到工人阶级的那种坚定的、乐观的、朴实的特质。
    以上是工人学生的一些重要的特点。但是他们有一个最严重的缺陷，这就是他们的文化程度赶不上他们的需要。比如他们的文化常识较低，常常阻碍他们对各门学科更深入更广泛的了解。他们的国文程度往往使他们写作时不能如意。这确是他们的极大困难。中国人民大学根据这样的具体情形，已经成立了文化补习班，让那些文化水平太跟不上的工人学生和革命干部先补习文化课一年或两年，同时教师们也利用一切可能找到的时间，给这些文化水平低的同学进行辅导。
    虽然工人在文化上确有困难，但是在学习中他们能够和革命干部与青年知识分子同样学好，而且工人还有一些有利的条件。一般说来，在政治经验方面，工人虽不如老干部，但是工人由于自己的阶级特点，亲身体验过各种政治的与经济的压迫，所以在学习政治理论课的时候，他们是一样容易深入，比青年知识分子要强。在文化方面，工人虽然比青年知识分子差，但是比某些老干部又强些，特别是年龄较轻，记忆力好的多。除此而外，工人都有一定的工业生产知识，他们学某些技术课的时候较容易懂，“过去活是会干，就是说不出道理”，这是一般老干部和青年知识分子所没有的。本科第一学期考试的结果，工人没有一个不及格的；老干部与青年知识分子都有不及格的几个或十几个。而平均分数这三类学生都在四分以上，几乎是相等的。（４．２２∶４．２３∶４．３２）。事实上，工人学生经过几个月到一年的学习后，已经有了很大的进步。政治理论与专门业务学得很好，文化水平也有显著的提高，困难已经不多了。所以，工人学生是很有培养前途的，中央人民政府决定中国人民大学招收工人学生，是完全正确的。
    中国人民大学现在正准备把财政经济各系的学习期限由三年延长到四年，在第一学年主要补习一些文化课，这样就会更便利于工人与革命干部来学习。如果将来各地的工农中学迅速办起来，我们国家就能够在大学内吸收大量的工人学生，培养出成千成万的工人专家，工人出身的新型知识分子，使我们国家的建设干部的雄壮队伍有强大的工人干部的坚强骨干，保证我们伟大祖国的建设成功。这样的日子是不会很远的。
