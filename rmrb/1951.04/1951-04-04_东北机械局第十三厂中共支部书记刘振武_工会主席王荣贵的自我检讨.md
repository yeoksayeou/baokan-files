To the Editors of the People's Daily:

    After seeing the criticism of us published in your newspaper on March 14th, we not only humbly accept it but also make the following self-criticism:

    (1) We did not pay enough attention to the health of our employees ideologically. At the same time, we have bureaucratic work styles, do not delve deeply into our work, and cannot fully understand the difficulties of employees in their work. As a result, some health-related problems of workers that should and could have been resolved were not resolved in a timely manner.

    (2) We lack a correct understanding of criticism and self-criticism. We have not seriously studied the CCP Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," which also shows that our political awareness is very poor. In the future, we will strengthen our political study, humbly accept criticism from the masses, care for the working masses, and improve our work.

                      Liu Zhenwu, Secretary of the Party Branch, No. 13 Factory of the Northeast Machinery Bureau
                      Wang Ronggui, Chairman of the Labor Union

专栏：对人民日报读者来信批评建议的反应

　　东北机械局第十三厂       
    中共支部书记刘振武  工会主席王荣贵的自我检讨编辑同志：
    见到三月十四日贵报刊登读者对我们的批评后，我们除虚心接受外，并作检讨如下：
    （一）我们思想上对职工身体健康问题不够重视。同时，自己又有官僚主义作风，工作不深入，也不能很好了解职工在工作中的困难，以致有些应该和可以解决的有关工人健康的问题，未能及时解决。
    （二）我们对批评与自我批评缺乏正确的认识。没有认真学习中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，这也说明我们的政治觉悟很差。今后我们决加强政治学习，虚心接受群众批评，关心工人群众，改进自己的工作。
                      东北机械局第十三厂  党支部书记 刘振武
                                           工会主席  王荣贵
