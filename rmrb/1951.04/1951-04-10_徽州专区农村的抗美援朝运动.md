　　The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Rural Huizhou Prefecture

　　The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in the Huizhou Prefecture of southern Anhui was very uneven in its initial stages, with the countryside lagging far behind the cities. The main reason for the lagging movement in the countryside was that some responsible cadres placed the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in opposition to practical work, and a few cadres had the biased idea that "peasants don't care about current affairs." For example, one district party secretary said: "We are so busy with land reform and collecting public grain, and we have to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and..., where can we find time for Resist America, Aid Korea?" A district-level cadre in She County said: "The peasants originally didn't know about the American aggression against Korea, and some issues are not clear to us ourselves. If the propaganda isn't good, it will cause ideological concerns among the peasants. Not only will we not do a good job with Resist America, Aid Korea, but it will also affect other work, so it's better to keep quiet and avoid trouble." In order to correct this phenomenon, the leading organs, on the one hand, emphasized that the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement and other work must be organically combined and mutually penetrate each other, and on the other hand, reprinted and compiled a batch of current affairs propaganda materials, so that all cadres who could understand them had a copy in hand for study. The CCP Huizhou Prefectural Committee also stipulated that all responsible comrades of the Prefectural Committee and County Committee going to the countryside should convene district cadres and land reform work team cadres in different regions to make reports. After more than ten days of study and reports, the cadres' thinking improved, and they learned the capital to publicize to the masses. At the same time, the working method of using key breakthroughs to promote general work was used. As a result, in areas where current affairs education was conducted, the peasants' political awareness of hating the U.S. and loving the country was improved, and the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement was launched, which vigorously promoted other tasks. From individual to general, from decentralization to concentration, cultivating activists to take the lead, from advanced to backward, gradually developed into an unprecedentedly broad and massive movement. This is the first characteristic.
    Exposing and accusing the crimes of the U.S., Chiang Kai-shek, and Japanese bandits, and linking them with land reform, anti-feudalism, and accusing the crimes of the landlord class, drawing a clear line between the enemy and us, establishing the idea and attitude of hating, despising, and scorning U.S. imperialism, and further taking practical actions to resist America and aid Korea, vigorously promoted the development of various tasks. This is the second important feature of the movement.
    In the previous period of the movement, there was a phenomenon in various places of being lively for a while but not going deep. The basic reasons were: on the one hand, some leading cadres one-sidedly believed that Resist America, Aid Korea was just propaganda and fundraising for comfort; on the other hand, the propaganda was generalized, and the line between the enemy and us was not clearly drawn. After review, various places began to specifically expose and accuse the crimes of U.S. imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and Japanese bandits, linking them with the accusations of landlords' crimes, and launched a movement to speak out about suffering and turn over a new leaf. The conclusion drawn was: U.S. imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the landlord class are the enemies of the people; the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the saviors of the people. Because the line between the enemy and us was clear, the peasants hated the enemy even more, and their enthusiasm for loving the motherland was even higher, thus promoting the movement to a higher stage. The peasants unanimously proposed: "In order to resist America and aid Korea, we must quickly pay and pay enough patriotic public grain." And they set patriotic covenants one after another. Therefore, except for a few villages with slight arrears, the entire prefecture completed the task of paying grain into the warehouse on time. Under the slogan of "To resist America and aid Korea, we must do a good job in land reform, overthrow feudalism, suppress counter-revolutionaries, join the People's Liberation Army, and defend the fruits of victory," more than 800 of the 1,183 villages in the entire prefecture have overthrown more than 1,000 local tyrants and evil landlords, and successfully completed the land reform. Rumors are now rarely heard in the countryside.
    Many young peasants in the entire prefecture have requested to join the army, and many older peasants said: "I can't go to the Korean front, I will work hard to dig yellow mud!" (referring to developing production by building water conservancy projects). All levels of society in the entire prefecture have also launched a donation campaign. According to preliminary statistics: the entire prefecture has donated more than 340 million yuan in bullet and grenade substitutes, and 27,589 consolation bags. During the movement, many people proposed: not only should they study current affairs themselves, but they should also publicize to others. As of now, more than 4,200 activists have gloriously served as propagandists.

　　徽州专区农村的抗美援朝运动
　　程光华
    皖南徽州专区的抗美援朝运动在初期是很不平衡的，农村远远落后于城市。农村抗美援朝运动所以落后的最主要的原因，是有些负责干部，把抗美援朝运动与实际工作对立起来，并有少数干部存在着“农民不关心时事”的思想偏向。如有的区委书记说：“土地改革征收公粮这么忙，又要镇压反革命，又要……，那里还顾得上抗美援朝呢？”歙县有的区级干部说：“农民本来不知道有什么美国侵朝战争，有些问题我们自己也闹不清楚，如果宣传不好反会引起农民的思想顾虑，不但搞不好抗美援朝，而且会影响别的工作，所以不如干脆闷着，省得找麻烦。”领导机关为纠正这种现象，一方面强调抗美援朝运动和其他工作必须有机结合，互相渗透，另一方面翻印和编印了一批时事宣传资料，让所有能看懂的干部，人手一册，以便进行学习。中共徽州地委并规定所有下乡的地委和县委负责同志，分地区召集区干部和土地改革工作队的干部作报告。经过十天多的学习和报告，干部的思想提高了，并学到了向群众宣传的资本。同时，运用了重点突破推动一般的工作方法。结果，凡是进行了时事教育的地区，农民们仇美爱国的政治思想觉悟就提高了，掀起了抗美援朝运动，而且有力地推动了其他各项工作。由个别到一般，由分散到集中，培养积极分子带头，由先进到落后，逐步发展成了空前广泛浩大的运动。这是第一个特点。
    揭发和控诉美、蒋、日寇罪行，并与土地改革、反封建、控诉地主阶级的罪恶联系起来，划清敌我界线，树立仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义的思想和态度，进一步以实际行动抗美援朝，有力地推动了各种工作的开展。这是运动的第二个重要特点。
    运动的前一个时期，各地发生了热闹一阵但是深入不下去的现象。基本原因是：一方面，有些领导干部片面地认为：抗美援朝就是宣传和捐募慰劳；另一方面，宣传一般化，敌我界线划分得不清楚。经过检讨后，各地开始具体地揭发和控诉了美帝国主义和国民党反动派及日寇的罪行，联系控诉地主罪行，展开了诉苦翻身运动。得出的结论是：美帝国主义、国民党反动派、地主阶级是人民的敌人；共产党、毛主席是人民的救星。由于敌我界线明确了，农民们对敌人更加仇视了，爱祖国的热情也就更加提高了，从而就推动运动走向更高阶段。农民们一致提出：“为抗美援朝，要快缴和缴够爱国公粮。”并纷纷订出了爱国公约。因此全专区除个别村略有尾欠外，都按期完成了缴粮入库任务。在“抗美援朝必须做好土地改革，打倒封建，镇压反革命，参加人民解放军，保卫胜利果实”的口号下，全专区一千一百八十三个村中，已有八百余村斗倒了千余名恶霸地主，顺利完成了土地改革。农村中现在很少能听到谣言了。
    全专区已有很多青年农民要求参军，很多年纪大的农民说：“我不能上朝鲜前线，我就努力挖黄泥！”（指兴修水利发展生产而言）全专区各阶层还开展了捐献运动。据初步统计：全专区共捐献子弹、手榴弹代金三亿四千多万元，慰问袋两万七千五百八十九个。运动中并有不少人提出：不仅自己学习时事，还要向别人宣传。截至目前止，已有四千二百余积极分子光荣的担任了宣传员。
