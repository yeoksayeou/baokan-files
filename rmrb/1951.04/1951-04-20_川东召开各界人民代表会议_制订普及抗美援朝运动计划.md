  　People's Representatives Conference Held in Eastern Sichuan
　  Formulating Plans for Popularizing the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
    The first session of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in Eastern Sichuan, with the central topic of popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, opened on April 8th and lasted for five days. The conference summarized the achievements of the region in carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and established a plan to popularize the movement throughout the region before May 1st. After heated discussions, the 524 representatives clarified the guiding principle of combining the central tasks of land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and developing the production movement with the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.
    According to the conference's summary, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in Eastern Sichuan has achieved initial results. Twenty-three of the region's thirty-five counties and cities have established Resist America, Aid Korea branches. The people of the region have donated 1.005 billion yuan in comfort funds and written 119,000 comfort letters to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's Army fighters. After the region widely carried out patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea, the progress of various tasks has been smooth.
    The conference formulated a plan to popularize the Resist America, Aid Korea movement before May 1st. The plan stipulates that after the participating representatives return, they should mobilize all government workers, students, teachers, and members of democratic parties and people's organizations in the region to universally launch current affairs studies before April 20th. Then, without hindering work or studies, a group of people will be selected to form several propaganda teams to go deep into districts and townships to assist local cadres in convening Resist America, Aid Korea representative conferences. The representatives participating in district and township meetings are responsible for conveying the message to the masses they contact and conducting discussions in conjunction with actual work such as developing production, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and land reform, formulating patriotic pacts, and launching production competitions. On May Day, each county, district, and township will hold Resist America, Aid Korea parades and demonstrations, and sign peace declarations at mass rallies. All factories and schools that have not universally carried out patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea must convene Resist America, Aid Korea representative meetings and sign patriotic pacts; those who have already signed them should inspect the implementation.
