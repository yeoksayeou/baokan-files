Landlord and Tenant Both Rejoice
An Example of the Beijing Real Estate Exchange Solving Housing Sales Problems

Comrade Editor:

Since the establishment of the Beijing Real Estate Exchange, it has rationally solved the housing sales and rental problems for many citizens. Now we are telling you about the Real Estate Exchange's resolution of the housing problem for 138 households in Tianqiao.

In the twenty-six addresses around Zhongshuli Liuhegong in Tianqiao, there are about two hundred households of working people, including small handicraftsmen, market vendors, rickshaw pullers, and cart pullers. They have lived in Tianqiao for decades; the houses they live in are all rented from the same landlord. The relationship between their landlord and tenants is very bad, and disputes often occur. The landlord intends to sell the house and wants the tenants to move; the tenants are unwilling to move because it is difficult to find a house. The landlord is unwilling to repair the house because the rent income is very low; the tenants are unwilling to repair it because the house is not their own. Therefore, the houses are in serious disrepair. After liberation, after several mediations by the public security station and the district office, it was suggested that the tenants jointly purchase the landlord's house. However, because the price could not be agreed upon, coupled with the manipulation of the brokers who demanded ten bags of flour per room from the tenants and falsely claimed to the landlord that the tenants could only offer four bags of flour, in an attempt to gain huge profits, the problem could not be resolved.

After the establishment of the South City Branch of the Beijing Real Estate Exchange, the landlord Deng Jingchuan went to the office to register the sale of the house. After understanding the above situation, the cadres of the exchange took the initiative to consult with the residents. At first, the tenants, due to insufficient understanding of the exchange's business, suspected that the Real Estate Exchange was there to evict them. After Director Yang Runtang of the branch personally held several meetings with the tenants and explained that the exchange primarily serves the broad masses of working people; through the exchange's introduction, the house sale price will definitely be reasonable, making both buyers and sellers completely satisfied. In this way, the tenants gradually dispelled their concerns. One hundred and thirty-eight households jointly elected several representatives to negotiate through the exchange. The landlord, seeing that the problem could be resolved, no longer insisted on an excessively high price; the tenants, believing that they could live in peace in the future, were also willing to pay a little more. As a result, a total of one hundred and seventy rooms were sold, and years of disputes were resolved.

On March 26th, the one hundred and thirty-eight households and the landlord went through the contract signing procedures at the exchange. The residents happily held the contract and said, "Now we finally have our own house, and we can concentrate on production in the future. If the People's Government hadn't worked so hard for us, and we had fallen into the hands of brokers, we don't know how much money we would have wasted! We must repair the house well under the leadership of the district repair committee." The landlord was also very happy and said, "The years of disputes have been resolved, and a weight has been lifted from my mind."

### 房客房主皆大欢喜  北京市房地产交易所解决房屋买卖问题的一个例子

    房客房主皆大欢喜
    北京市房地产交易所解决房屋买卖问题的一个例子编辑同志：
    北京市房地产交易所成立以后，为不少市民合理地解决了房子的买卖及租赁问题。现在我们把房地产交易所解决天桥一百三十八户住户住房问题的事告诉你们。
    本市天桥忠恕里六合公一带二十六个门牌里，住有小手工业者、市场摊贩、三轮工人和大车工人等劳动人民约二百户。他们在天桥住家已好几十年了；所住房子都是租自同一房主。他们房主、房客的关系很不好，时常发生纠纷。房主有意卖房，要房客搬家；房客则因找房困难，不肯迁出。房主因收入的房租很少，不肯修缮房屋；房客因房子不是自己的，也不肯修缮。因此房屋破漏的情形很严重。解放后，经公安派出所及区公所多次调解，建议最好由房客合伙置买房东的房子。但因房价讲不妥，加上拉房纤的从中捣乱：向房客要价十袋面一间房，向房主则诡称房客只能出四袋面，图谋从中获取巨利，因而问题一直不能解决。
    北京市房地产交易所南城分所成立后，房主邓景川曾往该所登记卖房。交易所干部了解以上情况后即主动找住户们进行磋商。开始房客们因对交易所业务不够了解，怀疑房地产交易所是来撵他们搬家的。经过分所杨润堂所长亲自和房客们几次开会，说明交易所首先是为广大劳动人民服务的；经过交易所介绍，一定让房屋买卖价钱合理，使买卖双方完全满意。这样，房客们才渐渐消除顾虑。有一百三十八个住户共同推举了几个代表，通过交易所进行商谈。房主因见问题能获得解决，不再坚持过高价钱；房客们认为今后可以安心住房，也愿意多出一点。结果，一共成交了一百七十间房；多年来的纠纷，获得了解决。
    三月二十六日，一百三十八个住户和房主在交易所办理立契手续，住户们笑嬉嬉地拿着契纸说：“这下总算有了自己的房子，以后可以安心搞生产了。要不是人民政府为我们不辞辛苦地办事，落到纤手手里，不知要花多少冤枉钱啦！我们一定要在区的修缮委员会领导下，修好房子。”房主也很高兴，说：“多年的纠纷解决了，真是一块石头落了地。”
