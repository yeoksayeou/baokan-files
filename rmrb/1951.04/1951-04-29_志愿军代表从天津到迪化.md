　　Volunteer Army Representatives Travel from Tianjin to Dihua
　　The Volunteer Army Returning Representative Group, composed of comrades Ji Bingqian, Li Weiying, and Zhang Fu, arrived in Tianjin on February 28th and, up to April 17th, reported on the combat situation of the Volunteer Army to 617,000 people from all walks of life in thirteen cities and towns including Tianjin, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xi'an, Baoji, Caijiapo, Yongledian, Wugong, Xianyang, Lanzhou, Xining, and Huangzhong. In Xi'an alone, over 230,000 people listened to the Volunteer Army representatives' broadcasts. In addition, the Nanyang Special District counties in Henan, the Henan Military Region units, and more than forty counties and cities in Gansu also widely organized the masses to listen to the Volunteer Army representatives' broadcasts. The reports by Comrade Ji Bingqian and others greatly promoted the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in the aforementioned areas. Comrade Ji Bingqian and his group arrived in Dihua on April 18th to deliver reports to people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.
　　During their ten days in Tianjin, the Volunteer Army representatives made a total of twenty-six reports, with a total audience of 104,000 people. Their reports greatly inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of the people from all walks of life in Tianjin and Tanggu. Many unorganized masses joined the ranks of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement after hearing the reports. After listening to the reports, the stevedores in Tianjin immediately organized themselves to discuss the Resist America, Aid Korea issue. After listening to the reports, the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles conveyed them to 143 units in various industries and launched an accusation movement against the aggressive atrocities of the United States and Japan. Teachers and students of all schools in Tianjin regarded the Volunteer Army representatives' reports as the most important political lesson. After listening to the reports, many cadres in government offices held meetings to review their own thoughts and work, and their enthusiasm was greatly enhanced. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School also launched a one-person-one-letter campaign, writing letters to their relatives and friends to convey the Volunteer Army representatives' reports.
　　The Volunteer Army representatives worked for a total of twelve days in Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang in Henan, making a total of twenty reports, with an audience of 150,000 people. When they arrived in Kaifeng on March 12th, it was already midnight, and the citizens rushed out of their houses to welcome them. National flags were hung everywhere, and firecrackers were set off everywhere, even more lively than the New Year. Many primary school students in Kaifeng were so anxious that they cried because they were not allowed to go to the station, insisting on "seeing the Volunteer Army uncles." Along the way, old ladies and old men competed to shake hands with the Volunteer Army soldiers. Some old people refused to wash their hands for days after shaking hands, and then went to shake hands with their relatives and friends. At the welcome meeting, farmers from the suburbs bared their chests and beat dozens of drums to welcome the Volunteer Army. Four- and five-year-old babies from the nursery danced the Yangko to present flowers: "Welcome the Volunteer Army uncles to return victoriously," "Congratulations to the Volunteer Army uncles for their good health." They also sang: "...Volunteer Army uncles are fighting for us, how can we not thank them! How can we not thank them!" Hao, an old lady of seventy-three, Zhao, an old lady of seventy-two, and Li, an old lady of sixty-seven, put big red flowers on the Volunteer Army representatives and handed over the comfort bags, shoes, and daily necessities made by the working women of Kaifeng to them, asking them to take them to the front: "Tell the comrades at the front, don't worry about us, eliminate more American bandits." Farmers in the suburbs presented the Volunteer Army with the radishes, sweet potatoes, and candied dates they had worked hard to produce. When the railway workers on the Shanxian to Luoyang section of the Longhai Railway heard the Volunteer Army report on the arduous combat situation of the soldiers at the front, many people cried. They took a week to discuss the Volunteer Army's report and resolved to cultivate fifteen model locomotives and seven cadre locomotives this year, and complete the task of 500,000 kilometers of safe driving. The Volunteer Army participated in the "March 18th" workers' demonstration parade in Zhengzhou and gave a report to more than 50,000 workers. After the meeting, the workers made plans to ensure support for the front and launched an in-depth production competition. In Zhengzhou, even the nuns sent representatives to present flowers to the Volunteer Army. They said: "We were backward in the past, but in the future we will participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea work." When the representatives left Kaifeng, more than 70,000 people (the population of Kaifeng is about 200,000) poured into the streets to see them off, and the roads were blocked by them. The Volunteer Army representatives spent more than an hour taking a car from their residence to the station, almost missing the train. Along the way, citizens competed to stuff flowers, diaries, shoes, and various comfort items into the car. Even an old lady in her nineties, who had not been out of the house for more than twenty years, came to see them off and wanted to shake hands. The crowd seeing them off shouted at the station: "The 32 million people of Henan Province will always be your backing." The people of Henan's love for the Volunteer Army was also expressed strongly in Zhengzhou and Luoyang. For example, the entire city of Luoyang had only 120,000 people, and more than 70,000 people participated in welcoming the Volunteer Army.
　　The Volunteer Army representatives arrived in Xi'an on March 25th and made twenty-two reports in Xi'an and the towns along the western section of the Longhai Railway, including Baoji, Caijiapo, Yongledian, Wugong, and Xianyang, with an audience of 173,000 people. More than 100,000 people in Xi'an participated in the welcoming of the Volunteer Army. The representatives' cars were surrounded by the welcoming crowds many times as they passed through the streets. Presenting flags and flowers, sending letters of condolence, and setting off firecrackers and throwing paper flowers were continuous along the way. Many people scrambled to get close to the car to shake hands with the Volunteer Army. Students from the Northwest Medical College pulled the Volunteer Army out of the car and carried them away. Many old women and housewives took to the streets to welcome them, shouting slogans like young people. When the representatives arrived in Xianyang, 12,000 people went five miles outside the city to greet them and carried the representatives all the way into the city. In Wugong, when the representatives left after 2 a.m., thousands of people saw them off with torches.
　　The representatives' reports in various parts of Shaanxi played a great role in resisting America and aiding Korea, in production, and in other work. Han Xingkui, an employee of the Longhai Railway, said: "In the past, I thought that the American soldiers had good weapons and ate well, and I was worried that we would not be able to defeat them. Now I know that we are fully confident of defeating the enemy. The Volunteer Army is fighting in minus thirty degrees, and we in the rear must step up production to support the front." Wang Chunrong and Xing Mingfu, workers at the Dahua Yarn Factory, after hearing the report, immediately led the workers to increase the speed of six sets of twenty-spindle spinning frames from 129 revolutions per minute to 148 revolutions per minute that night. Postal and telecommunications workers guarantee that the front-line mail and telecommunications will not be delayed or have wrong words. After listening to the report, commanders and fighters of a certain unit successively formulated training plans, proposing to "practice realistically, practice hard, practice rigidly, and practice more" to consolidate national defense and protect the people. The Buddhist community wrote in a letter to the representatives: "We believe that you can defeat the American imperialist demons. We regard you as true Buddhas and living Buddhas." Young students are generally brewing to formulate patriotic covenants and study plans. Following the students of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School in Tianjin, students of Northwest University launched a one-letter campaign, guaranteeing that everyone who listened to the report would write a letter to their relatives and friends to convey what they had heard. After listening to the report, the industrial and commercial circles immediately checked the implementation of the patriotic covenant and felt that they had put the patriotic covenant aside after it was made, "sorry for the Volunteer Army."
　　The Volunteer Army representatives arrived in Lanzhou on April 6th and made fifteen reports in six days, with an audience of more than 111,000 people, that is, one out of every two people in the city heard the Volunteer Army representatives' reports, and in addition, more than 40,000 people listened to the Volunteer Army representatives' broadcasts. The enthusiastic welcome of the people of Lanzhou to the Volunteer Army representatives can be seen from the above figures. Through the representatives' oral reports, broadcasts, and planned and organized dissemination, the story of Guo Zhongtian's hero platoon has become a household name in Lanzhou, and everyone praises it. Not only that, but after listening to the reports, the workers, students, government employees, and ordinary citizens of Lanzhou also directly wrote letters of determination and guarantee to the representatives. A small service worker at Lanzhou Women's Normal School wrote in the letter of determination: "I will do the work of three people by myself." The workers of the Lanzhou Power Plant and Flour Mill also discussed the report and proposed production competition challenges to each other.
　　In Xining, Huangzhong, and other places, after listening to the Volunteer Army representatives' reports, people of all ethnic groups immediately carried out dissemination and discussion, and successively formulated plans to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. Tibetan students in the Workers' and Peasants' Class of Qinghai Provincial Nationalities College guaranteed to learn five new characters every day, and primary and secondary schools in the city decided to add learning courses such as "History of American Aggression against China" and "Relations between China and Korea" every week.

　　志愿军代表从天津到迪化
    由稽炳前、李维英、张甫三位同志组成的志愿军归国代表小组，自二月二十八日到达天津起，迄至四月十七日止，先后向天津、开封、郑州、洛阳、西安、宝鸡、蔡家坡、永乐店、武功、咸阳、兰州、西宁、湟中等十三个城镇的各界人民六十一万七千多人报告了志愿军作战的情况。收听志愿军代表广播的，仅西安一地，即有二十三万余人。此外，河南的南阳专区各县、河南军区各部队、甘肃的四十多个县市也曾广泛组织群众收听志愿军代表的广播。稽炳前等同志的报告，对于上述各地人民的抗美援朝运动，起了很大的推动作用。稽炳前同志等一行已于四月十八日到达迪化向新疆各民族人民作报告。
    在天津的十天中，志愿军代表一共作了二十六次报告，听众共达十万四千人。他们的报告，大大地激励了天津、塘沽各界人民的爱国热情。许多无组织的群众，因为听了报告，加入了抗美援朝运动的行列。天津的搬运工人在听报告后，马上组织起来，讨论抗美援朝问题。天津工商界在听报告后，在各行业的一百四十三个单位作了传达，并展开了对美、日侵略暴行的控诉运动。天津的各校师生，都把志愿军代表的报告，认为是最重要的政治课。许多机关工作干部，听了报告后，开会检讨了自己的思想和工作，积极性大大提高。全国总工会干部学校还发起了一人一信运动，写信给自己的亲友传达志愿军代表的报告。
    志愿军代表在河南的开封、郑州、洛阳三地，一共工作了十二天，作报告共二十次，听众十五万人。他们在三月十二日到达开封时，已经是半夜，市民群众纷纷从屋里跑出来欢迎他们，满街遍悬国旗，到处放起爆竹，比过年还要热闹。开封市许多小学生因为没有被准许到车站去，急得哭起来，一定“要见见志愿军的叔叔去”。一路上，老太太老太爷都争着和志愿军握手，有些老人握了手后几天都不肯洗手，再去握自己的亲友。在欢迎大会上，郊区农民赤着胸脯，擂起几十面大鼓欢迎志愿军。托儿所四五岁的小宝宝扭着秧歌来献花：“欢迎志愿军叔叔胜利归来”，“恭祝志愿军叔叔健康”。他们还唱着：“……志愿军叔叔为我们打仗，我们怎能不感谢！我们怎能不感谢！”七十三岁的郝老大娘、七十二岁的赵大娘、六十七岁的李大娘，替志愿军代表戴上大红花，并把开封市劳动妇女做的慰问袋、鞋子以及日用品交到他们的手里，让他们带到前方去：“告诉前方同志，不要惦记我们，多多消灭美国强盗。”郊区的农民把他们辛勤生产出来的萝卜、地瓜、焦枣献给志愿军。陇海路陕县到洛阳段的铁路工人，听志愿军报告到前方将士艰苦作战的情况时，许多人哭起来了。他们拿了一星期的时间来讨论志愿军的报告，决心在今年内培养出十五台模范机车和七台机干车，完成五十万公里安全行车的任务。志愿军在郑州参加了“三一八”工人示威游行大会，给五万多工人作了报告。会后工人纷纷制订计划，保证支援前线，深入展开生产竞赛。在郑州，连修道女也派出代表向志愿军献花。她们说：“过去我们落后，今后我们要参加抗美援朝工作。”当代表们离开开封时，七万多群众（按开封市人口约二十万）涌到街头欢送，道路都被他们阻断了。志愿军代表从住地坐汽车到车站，竟费了一个多钟头的时间，几乎误了上火车。一路上市民群众争着把鲜花、日记本、鞋子和各种慰劳品慰问袋塞到车上来。连九十多岁、已有二十多年未出门的一位老太太也来欢送，要握握手。欢送的群众在车站上高呼：“河南省三千二百万人民永远做你们的后盾。”河南人民对于志愿军的热爱在郑州和洛阳也表现得同样强烈。例如洛阳全市仅有十二万人，参加欢迎志愿军的竟达到七万多人。
    志愿军代表在三月二十五日到达西安，先后在西安及陇海路西段沿线的宝鸡、蔡家坡、永乐店、武功、咸阳等城镇作了二十二次报告，听众共达十七万三千人。西安有十万余人参加欢迎志愿军的行列。代表的汽车经过各街道时，多次被欢迎群众所包围。献旗献花、呈送慰问信、鸣发鞭炮掷纸花的，沿途不绝。许多人争着挤近车子来同志愿军握手。西北医学院的学生把志愿军从车上拉下来抬着走。许多老太婆、家庭妇女都上街欢迎，高呼口号，一如青年人。代表到咸阳时，群众一万二千人到五里外迎接，把代表一直抬进城里。在武功，代表在午夜后二时离开时，群众数千人点着火把欢送。
    代表们在陕西各地的报告，对于抗美援朝和生产以及其他工作，起了很大作用。陇海铁路职工韩星奎说：“过去我还以为美国兵武器好，吃得又好，担心我们打不过，现在我才知道我们完全有把握打败敌人。志愿军在零下三十度作战，我们在后方一定要加紧生产，支援前线。”大华纱厂工人王春荣、邢明福听了报告，当晚即带动工人把六部二十支细纱车的转数，由每分钟一百二十九转提高到一百四十八转。邮电工人保证前方邮电不延误、不错字。某部指战员听报告后，纷纷订立练兵计划，提出要“实练、苦练、硬练、多练”，巩固国防，保卫人民。佛教界写给代表的信中说：“相信你们能打垮美帝恶魔。我们把你们当真佛爷、活佛爷看待。”青年学生普遍酝酿订立爱国公约和学习计划。西北大学学生继天津全国总工会干部学校学生之后，发起一封信运动，保证每个听报告的人将所听报告写信转告自己的亲友。工商界在听报告后，即检查爱国公约的执行情况，感到从前订了爱国公约就搁起，“对不住志愿军”。
    志愿军代表于四月六日到达兰州，在六天中作了十五次报告，听众十一万一千余人，即全市每两个人中就有一个人听到了志愿军代表的报告，此外听志愿军代表广播的还有四万人以上。兰州的人民群众对于志愿军代表的热烈欢迎，从上面这些数字中就可以看出来。通过代表们的口头报告、广播和有计划有组织的传达，郭忠田英雄排的故事，在兰州已是家喻户晓，人人传颂。不仅如此，兰州的工人、学生、机关职员和普通市民听了报告后，还直接向代表们写了决心书和保证书。兰州女师一个小勤务员在决心书上写着：“三个人的工作，我一个人要干。”兰州电厂和面粉厂的工人们，并且讨论了报告，纷纷互相提出生产竞赛挑战。
    在西宁、湟中等地，各族人民听了志愿军代表的报告后，也立即普遍进行了传达和讨论，并纷纷订了普及和深入抗美援朝运动的计划。青海省民族公学工农班藏族学生保证每天学会五个生字，市内各中小学并决定每周增加“美国侵华史”和“中朝两国的关系”等学习课程。
