Key speakers at the meeting included Scoccimarro, Chairman of the Italian Communist Party's parliamentary group in the Upper House, Vittorio, General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, and Central Committee members such as Sereni. They unanimously expressed their support for the reports of Togliatti and Longo.

All the delegates stood up and cheered, "Long live the alliance of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party! Long live the World Peace Council!" fully demonstrating the unbreakable unity between the two working-class parties in Italy.

　　The congress concluded the discussion of the reports of Togliatti and Longo at the meeting on the 8th. Subsequently, the congress proceeded with the work of passing resolutions and electing the new leading body of the Italian Communist Party. After the Credentials Committee announced that there were a total of 750 delegates attending the congress, the congress unanimously passed the resolution drafted by the congress political committee: approving the work of the Central Committee since the Sixth Party Congress, and in the name of the congress, taking Togliatti's proposal as the main task of the entire party and the country, namely, to strive for the establishment of a "government of peace," to oppose the interference of foreign imperialism and the rule of its handful of Italian lackeys, and to launch a signature campaign demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. The congress also passed the resolution on the party's organizational activities drafted by the congress organizational committee. The congress unanimously elected a new central committee headed by Togliatti, Longo, and Secchia. Amidst a storm of cheers, the congress passed a telegram of greetings to the heroic Korean and Chinese people, to the Soviet Union and the fraternal parties of all countries in the world, and to all forces fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism.

　　The General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti, delivered the closing speech. He pointed out that the central proposal of this congress is the proposal to rise up and take power. This proposal, after changing the foreign policy of the current government, can save peace for the Italian people. Finally, he called on the whole party to strive, "so that the Italian people's will to demand peace, economic recovery, and democracy will be victorious," and then announced the closing of the congress, and shouted "Long live peace!" The congress then closed amidst the majestic strains of "The Internationale."

　　意共第七次代表大会胜利闭幕
    大会决议为争取建立“和平政府”而斗争
    一致选出托里亚蒂等组成新中央委员会
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯，意大利共产党第七次全国代表大会，已于八日胜利闭幕。
    在五日以来的连日会议上，大会代表继续热烈地讨论意共总书记托里亚蒂与副总书记隆哥在大会上的报告。会上主要的发言者有意共议会上院党团主席斯科西马罗，意大利总工会总书记维多里奥，塞伦尼等中央委员。他们一致表示拥护托里亚蒂和隆哥的报告。
    在五日会议上，大会热烈欢迎意大利社会党总书记、世界和平理事会副主席南尼的到会。全体代表起立欢呼“共产党与社会党的联盟万岁！世界和平理事会万岁！”充分表现了意大利两个工人阶级政党间牢不可破的团结。
    大会在八日会议上结束了对托里亚蒂和隆哥的报告的讨论。接着，大会就进行通过决议和选举意共新领导机构的工作。在资格审查委员会宣布了出席大会的代表共有七百五十人之后，大会一致通过了大会政治委员会所拟定的决议案：批准自第六次党代表大会以来中央委员会的工作，并以大会的名义把托里亚蒂的建议作为全党全国的主要任务，即为争取建立“和平政府”，反对外国帝国主义的干涉及其一小撮意大利走狗的统治而斗争，并展开要求缔结五大国和平公约的签名运动。大会也通过了大会组织委员会所拟关于党的组织活动的决议案。大会一致选出了以托里亚蒂、隆哥、谢嘉等为首的新的中央委员会。在暴风雨般的欢呼声中，大会通过了向英勇的朝鲜和中国人民、向苏联和全世界各国兄弟党及一切为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的力量致敬的电文。
    意共总书记托里亚蒂致闭幕辞。他指出这次大会的中心建议就是关于起来当政的建议。这个建议在改变现政府的外交政策以后，可以为意大利人民挽救和平。最后，他号召全党努力斗争，“使意大利人民要求和平、要求经济复兴、要求民主的意志获得胜利”，然后宣布大会闭幕，并高呼“和平万岁！”大会于是在雄壮的“国际歌”声中闭幕。
