To the Editors:

We are extremely ashamed upon reading Comrade Li Xin's criticism in the "Readers and Editors" column of your newspaper on April 15th regarding the book "How to Prevent Epidemics" published by our bookstore. This book was first published in 1948, and when it was reprinted in 1950, we assumed that specialized works on medical hygiene like this would not involve political errors, and thus proceeded with the reprint. This serious oversight reveals our bookstore's lack of diligence and responsibility. After self-examination, we will resolutely strive to eradicate this careless approach and establish a serious, practical, and service-oriented attitude. The following handling measures have been decided:

(1) All remaining copies will be removed from sale (2,957 copies remained as of April 18th, the date of the publication).

(2) We will also request assistance from fellow booksellers and readers to recover the copies that have already been sold.

(3) The author has gone abroad, making it impossible to notify them for self-examination. We will have experts revise the book.

(4) Our bookstore will conduct a thorough review of all publications to ensure that similar errors do not occur in the future.

Traffic Bookstore, Shanghai Branch, April 19th

Editor's Note: The Traffic Bookstore's self-criticism and decided handling methods should be commended. Enclosed with this letter to us was a circular it sent to fellow booksellers, requesting them to immediately cease selling any unsold copies; for books already sold, they hoped to notify readers to return them to the bookstore for exchange, with all round-trip postage for exchanges borne by the bookstore, whether for booksellers or readers. This thorough and responsible spirit is worthy of emulation by all publishers who have committed similar errors. At the same time, we also received a letter dated April 20th from Comrade Li Xin in Wu'yi County, informing us that the bookstore in Tianjin where he bought 200 books had already recovered all of them on April 18th and refunded the price. This bookstore, which sincerely accepted criticism and quickly took action, should also be praised.

### 文通书局对《怎样防疫》一书的检讨与处理

专栏：

　　文通书局对《怎样防疫》一书的检讨与处理编辑同志：
    你报四月十五日读者编者栏李欣同志对本店出版的《怎样防疫》一书的批评，使我们感到万分惭愧。本书是于一九四八年发行初版，一九五○年再版审查时，以为有关这一类医学卫生的专门著述，不会涉及政治上的错误，便拿来再版。这种严重的疏忽，揭露了本店缺乏认真与负责的精神，经检讨后，绝对努力根除这种粗枝大叶的作风，建立认真的实事求是的服务态度。兹将处理办法决定如下：
    （一）全部存书停止发售（截至四月十八日见报日止结存二千九百五十七册）。
    （二）已售出各书，亦分别要求同业及读者的协助设法予以收回。
    （三）著者已去国外，无法通知其本人检讨，本书将另请专家修订。
    （四）本店将全部出版物进行彻底的审查，保证以后不再发生类似的错误。
        交通书局上海分局启  四月十九日
    编者按：交通书局所作的检讨和决定的处理办法应该受到表扬。它在给我们这封信里，还附了它给同业的一个通启，要求同业将未售的书一律停止发售；对已售的书，也希望通知读者退回该局掉换，无论同业或读者掉换，所有往返寄费全由该局负担。这种彻底负责的精神是值得一切犯有同类错误的出版家仿效的。同时，我们也接到李欣同志四月二十日自武邑县来信，告诉我们：他在天津某一书店买的二百本书，已于四月十八日由该书店全部收回，并退还书价。诚恳接受批评并很快地加以处理，这家经售书店也是应该受到称许的。
