  A Translation of an Engels Classic Published
    Engels' early (1843) work, "Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy," translated by He Sijing, has been published by the People's Publishing House. This article was first published in the "Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher" in 1844 and later collected in "Marx-Engels Archives." After World War I, the German Communist Party compiled it into a "Collection of Political Economy Papers."
    Engels' essay fundamentally exposes the contradictions in the bourgeois classical economics and the theories of its followers, analyzes the laws of capitalist production and economic crises, and points out that science under capitalism has changed from a means of liberating mankind to a means of enslaving the working class. Engels' work can be said to be the initial exposition of Marxist economics.
    Marx wrote a note after reading this essay, which has also been translated by the translator as an appendix to this book.
  Shanghai Holds Comic Strip Exhibition
    The publication of comic strips has a history of forty years. In order to study the development trend of comic strips over the past forty years and summarize the transformation of old comic strips and the development of new comic strips since liberation, Shanghai has held a comic strip exhibition from the 9th of this month.
    The statistical charts at the exhibition clearly show that new, educational comic strips, which are warmly loved by the people, are flourishing. In 1950, more than 1,000 new works were published relating to Resist America, Aid Korea, worker life, peasant emancipation, combat deeds, heroic labor, ideological reform, breaking superstitions, scientific knowledge, marriage issues, children's stories, and so on, which were loved by the majority of readers. The total sales volume for the year reached 3,946,256 copies. Each new comic strip sold at least 5,000 copies, with the most selling over 80,000 copies. The number of publishing houses has also increased from 47 to 117, with distribution areas reaching as far as Dihua, Jiamusi, Kangding, Guangzhou, and Southeast Asia. This fully demonstrates that new comic strips, while continuously improving their content, will have broader prospects with the advent of the new cultural movement.
    We hope that through this exhibition, the understanding of this popular art form among the masses and art workers can be further clarified and improved, and then the compilation, drawing, and publication of it can be strengthened and improved.
  "New Acupuncture" by Zhu Lian Published
    Acupuncture treatment has a long history in Chinese medicine. Comrade Zhu Lian has initially made it scientific and wrote the book "New Acupuncture," which has recently been published by the People's Publishing House. Comrade Dong Biwu wrote a preface for this book based on his personal experience of being treated, pointing out that "using scientific methods to study our country's acupuncture, stripping away its mysterious veil, studying and explaining its rational content, and promoting it is not useless in medicine and medical care. Especially in today's China, where medicine and medical care are both lacking, it is especially necessary to scientize and promote the acupuncture known to workers, peasants, and laborers."
  "Pharmaceuticals" Conducts Scientific Research on Traditional Chinese Medicine
    Advocating and promoting our country's excellent drugs and promoting the rapid development of the people's health and medical cause is a concrete manifestation of patriotism by medical and pharmaceutical scientific workers. The fourth volume, third issue, of the monthly journal "Pharmaceuticals" focused on the research of domestically produced Chinese medicines, and published a special issue on Chinese medicine, and plans to continue to publish it in the future. This issue provides some research results, such as using "Guanzhong" instead of the foreign medicine "Dryopteris crassirhizoma" to treat tapeworms, the effectiveness of using seaweed to treat goiter (thyroid swelling), and the analysis of the common Chinese medicine Akebia trifoliata, all of which are valuable works. The "New Pharmaceutical Knowledge" column also explains the long-used method of treating burns with oil-soaked newborn mice and the method of washing carbuncles with pig hoof soup, combined with the latest invention of tissue therapy. This kind of excavation and research is also meaningful.
  Popular Science Hygiene Journal "Health News"
    The Northeast Medical Book Publishing House launched "Health News" in January of this year, with the main task of improving the health knowledge of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In terms of editing, it adheres to the principles of more pictures and fewer words, short articles, and uses a variety of forms such as stories, comic strips, ballads, fast-clapper talks, drums, and short plays to publicize health knowledge to the masses. This is a well-run popular science health publication.
  "New Sports" Calls for Strengthening School Sports Activities
    The ninth issue of "New Sports" magazine, in response to the phenomenon that schools do not pay enough attention to sports education, published an editorial entitled "Consolidate and Develop the Gains of School Sports in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement," calling on sports teachers across the country to pay attention to students' demands for physical exercise based on patriotism, vigorously carry out school sports education, and consolidate sports activities under the banner of patriotism. The article "Several Experiences in Sports Teaching at Renmin University of China" introduced the achievements of Renmin University's sports activities over the past year and the Soviet four-stage sports teaching method. The article "How to Make School Students Persist in Exercising Every Day?" raised the question of how to make school sports activities lasting, which is worthy of study and resolution by student unions and the Communist Youth League in various schools. This issue of "New Sports" has more discussions on the issue of sports education in primary and secondary schools. The health of young students is not only an important condition for current studies but also for future participation in production and national defense. It is hoped that schools can pay attention to the problems raised in many articles in this issue.
  Two Sports Books
    Only in people's democratic countries and socialist countries can truly widespread sports education for all be implemented. The World Knowledge Press has recently published "An Overview of Soviet Sports," edited by Liu Dechao, which briefly introduces the development, history, and methods of Soviet sports. The entire book has twelve chapters, with a focus on the chapters below four, which respectively introduce sports education at all levels and the situation of various sports activities. There is currently a great lack of books in this area, and this book is a good reference book for learning about Soviet sports work.
    The Shandong People's Publishing House reprinted the book "Sports Teaching Materials" in January 1951, based on the first edition published by the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore in April 1950. The original book was compiled by the Harbin Education Bureau, and the content was a revision and reorganization of various sports teaching materials implemented in Harbin schools from 1946 to 1948 and various gymnastics performances in the city's sports meets. In addition to the introduction, it elaborates on coach exercises, flexibility exercises, apparatus exercises, competitive games, dances, and group exercises, and includes diagrams, which are quite worthy of reference.
  "Life Knowledge" Column "Propaganda Worker Work"
    Strengthening the work of propagandists is an important task regarding the decision to establish a propaganda network for the Party among the people. The "Propaganda Worker Work" column of "Life Knowledge" regularly reflects the work of propagandists and introduces work experience. For example, issues 91, 92, and 93 introduced the "Experience of Propaganda Workers in Building the Communist Youth League in Factories," pointing out that "the emergence of propagandists" is best when comrades with mass work experience are appointed, and attention should be paid to cultivating activists with good mass relations and hard work. The factory's Youth League Committee organizes experience exchanges through propaganda worker meetings, and cadres should actively assist propaganda workers in collecting and reflecting information, which serves as an important reference for improving teaching content and methods. Experience has proven that the establishment of propagandists is of great benefit to strengthening the League's propaganda and education work; through this system, League members can receive more regular and systematic political education, thereby improving the political level of League members. Issues 96 and 97 introduced the "Experience of Propaganda Workers in Building the Communist Youth League in Rural Areas," pointing out that it is necessary to set up transmission stations in the central villages of the district, which can make up for the shortcomings of low cultural levels. Propagandists must connect with reality when carrying out their work and speak to the thoughts of League members and young people to make the content lively and interesting. For example, issues 103 and 104 introduced the process and experience of establishing League propagandists in Heilongjiang Province, pointing out that it is necessary to strengthen the political education of propagandists with leadership and planning. The ideas that "propaganda worker work is just a fad, and it's over once it's over," or "there are no conditions for engaging in propagandists in rural areas" are wrong.
    "Translation Bulletin" May Call for Papers
    In order to commemorate the important anniversary in modern translation work - "May Fourth," the "Translation Bulletin" decided to increase the number of pages in the May issue to review the translation achievements since the May Fourth Movement, summarize the translation experience since the May Fourth Movement, and point out certain directions and steps for future translation work. Proposed topics for submissions include: "The May Fourth Movement and Translation," "Translation since the May Fourth Movement," "On the Organizational Issues of Translation Work," "A Review of the Organization of Buddhist Scripture Translation Sites," "How the Soviet Union Organizes Translation Work," "The Standards of Current Translation Work," "On the Review System of Translation Work," "Studying Chairman Mao's Instructions on Translation Work," "Stalin's Linguistic Theory and Our Translation Work," and "On the Compilation of Chinese Translation History," etc.

专栏：出版动态

　　出版动态
  一本恩格斯古典著作译本出版
    恩格斯的早年（一八四三年）著作《国民经济学批判大纲》，已由何思敬译交人民出版社出版。本文第一次登在一八四四年的《德法年刊》上，后来收集在《马恩遗文集》中，第一次世界大战后，德国共产党把它编在一个《政治经济学论文集》里面。
    恩格斯的这篇论文，对于资产阶级古典经济学及其流亚们的学说的矛盾，予以根本揭发，并分析了资本主义生产与经济危机的规律，指出科学在资本主义之下，由解放人类的手段变成奴役工人阶级的手段。恩格斯这一著作可以说是马克思主义经济学的最初的论述。
    马克思在读了这篇论文后写了一个笔记，也经译者译出作为本书的附录。
  上海举行连环图画展览会
    连环图画的出版已有四十年的历史，为研究四十年连环图画发展的趋势，总结解放以后旧连环图画的改造与新连环图画的发展，上海市于本月九日起举行了连环图画展览会。
    在展览会的统计图表上，清晰表示出：人民热烈爱好的富于教育意义的新连环画，正在蓬勃发展。一九五○年出版了一千种以上有关抗美援朝、工人生活、农民翻身、战斗事迹、英雄劳动、思想改造、破除迷信、科学知识、婚姻问题、儿童故事等等各种新作品，得到广大读者爱好。全年总销售量达三、九四六、二五六本。每一本新连环画至少发行五千本，最多的销达八万本以上。出版业也从四十七家增到一一七家，发行地区远到迪化、佳木斯、康定、广州以及南洋。这充分说明了新连环画在不断改进内容中，随着新文化运动高潮的到来，将有更广阔的前途。
    我们希望通过这一展览会能把群众和美术工作者对这一通俗的艺术形式的认识，更加明确、提高起来，继而加强并改善它的编绘与出版。
  朱琏著《新针灸学》出版
    针灸治病，在我国医术上有很久的历史。朱琏同志初步把它科学化，著成《新针灸术》一书，已于最近由人民出版社出版。董必武同志曾就其亲身受治的经验，为这本书作了一篇序文，指出“用科学的方法来研究我国的针灸术，剥掉它神秘的外衣，研究和解释它合理的内容，加以发扬光大，在医学和医务上不是无益的事。特别是在我国医药两缺的今日，把工农劳动人民所习知的针灸术科学化发扬光大，尤为必要。”
  “医药学”进行中药的科学研究
    提倡发扬我国优良药物，推动人民卫生医药事业的迅速发展，是医药科学工作者爱国主义的具体表现。《医药学》月刊四卷三期，以研究国产生药为中心内容，出了中药特辑之一，并计划以后还要续出。本期提供了若干的研究成果，如以“贯众”代替外来药品“绵马”以治螩虫，以海藻医治大脖子（甲状腺肿）的成效，对常用国药木通成份的分析，都是很有价值的著述。“医药新知”栏也把我国习用已久的油浸新生鼠治火烫伤法和猪蹄汤洗痈疽法结合了最新发明的组织疗法作了说明，这种发掘与钻研也是有意义的。
  通俗的卫生科学期刊《卫生报》
    东北医学图书出版社在本年一月创刊了一种以提高工农兵卫生常识为主要任务的《卫生报》。它在编辑上，以图多字少、文章简短为原则，配合故事、连环图画、歌谣、快板、大鼓、短剧等多种多样的形式，对群众进行卫生知识的宣传。这是一种办得较好的通俗卫生刊物。
  《新体育》号召加强学校体育活动
    《新体育》杂志第九期针对各校对体育教育不够重视的现象，发表了“巩固和发展学校体育在抗美援朝运动中的收获”的社论，号召全国体育教师重视学生基于爱国主义的锻炼身体的要求，大力开展学校体育教育，把体育运动在爱国主义的旗帜下巩固起来。“中国人民大学体育教学的几点经验”一文，介绍了一年来人民大学体育活动的成就和苏联四段体育教学法。“怎样使学校同学每天运动坚持下去？”一文，提出怎样才能使学校体育活动持久进行的问题，值得各校学生会和青年团加以研究解决。本期《新体育》对于中小学体育教育问题有较多的论述。青年学生的健康，不但是目前的学习而且更是将来参加生产和国防的重要条件，本期许多文章中提出的问题，希望各学校能够注意研究。
  两本体育书
    只有在人民民主国家和社会主义国家，才能实行真正广泛的全民体育教育。世界知识社最近出版了一本刘德超编著的《苏联体育事业概观》，简明介绍了苏联体育的发展情况、历史和方法。全书—二章，重点在四章以下，分别介绍各级体育教育及各项体育运动情况。目前这方面书籍极感缺少，本书不失为学习苏联体育工作的一本好的参考书。
    山东人民出版社一九五一年一月根据一九五○年四月东北新华书店初版本重印了《体育教材》一书，原书是哈尔滨市教育局编的，内容系修正整理一九四六年至一九四八年间哈市各学校实行的各种体育教材以及市运动会中的各种体操表演而成。除绪论外，对教练操、柔软体操、器械操、竞争游戏、舞蹈与团体操均有所阐述，并附图解，颇值得参考。
  “生活知识”的“宣传员工作”栏
    加强宣传员工作，是关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定的重要工作。“生活知识”的“宣传员工作”栏，经常反映宣传员的工作情况和工作经验介绍，如九十一、九十二、九十三期，介绍了“工厂中试建团的宣传员经验”，指出“宣传员的产生”最好是有群众工作经验的同志担任，要注意培养群众关系好、工作努力的积极分子；工厂团委通过宣传员会议组织经验交流，干部要主动地协助宣传员搜集反映，作为改进教学内容与方法的重要参考。经验证明：宣传员的建立对加强团的宣教工作是大有好处的；通过这种制度可以对团员进行较为经常的、系统的政治教育，从而提高了团员的政治水平。九十六、九十七期介绍了“农村中试建团的宣传员的经验”，指出必须要在区的中心村设立传授站，这样便可以弥补文化水平低的缺陷。宣传员在进行工作时必须要联系实际，针对团员及青年的思想去讲，要使内容生动活泼。又如一○三、一○四期上，介绍了黑龙江省建立团的宣传员的经过与经验，指出必须有领导、有计划地加强宣传员的政治教育，“宣传员工作是一阵风，过去就拉倒”，或“农村搞宣传员没条件”的想法都是错误的。
    《翻译通报》五月号征文
    《翻译通报》为了纪念现代翻译工作中的重要纪念日——“五四”，决定在五月号增加篇幅，检阅五四以来的翻译成绩，总结五四以来的翻译经验，并对今后的翻译工作指出一定的方向和步骤。征文拟题有：“五四与翻译”、“五四以来的翻译”，“论翻译工作的组织问题”、“佛经译场组织述评”、“苏联如何组织翻译工作”、“目前翻译工作的标准”、“论翻译工作的审校制度”、“学习毛主席对翻译工作的指示”、“斯大林语言学理论观与我们的翻译工作”、“论中国翻译史的编修问题”等。
