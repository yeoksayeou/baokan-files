　　Illegality of the US-Drafted "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan"
　　Zhang Mingyang
    The "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" recently published by the US government is the most blatant and concrete manifestation of completely illegal separate peace-making activities with Japan. The meaning of "completely illegal" refers to the fact that this "draft treaty," unilaterally formulated by the United States, completely violates and undermines all international agreements and principles of international law on the Japanese question.
  I
    First, we must ask: Who authorized the United States to formulate the "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" and force other allied countries to accept it? China, which made the most significant contribution to defeating Japanese imperialism, did not authorize it, nor did the Soviet Union, nor did other allied countries. Yet, the United States arbitrarily and unilaterally formulated the "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan," forcing other countries to accept it. This is an unprecedentedly arrogant act in history. According to the precedent of drafting and signing treaties with defeated countries after World War II, the right to draft treaties belongs to the Council of Foreign Ministers or countries authorized by the Council of Foreign Ministers. For example, the Moscow Council of Foreign Ministers authorized the four countries of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France to draft the treaty with Italy, and the three countries of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States to draft treaties with Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, and the two countries of the Soviet Union and Britain to draft the treaty with Finland. But now the United States, without authorization from any country, and without the consent of any country, unilaterally formulated the "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan." This is an absurd act that completely disregards international norms.
    At the same time, the United States also violated the provisions of the January 1, 1942, Declaration of Twenty-Six Nations: "Each Government undertakes to cooperate with the Governments signatory hereto and not to enter into a separate armistice or treaty of peace with the enemies." The United States, as well as twenty-six countries including China, the Soviet Union, Britain, Canada, India, Australia, and New Zealand, all signed this declaration. Now the United States has completely broken this important international declaration that it signed, and is conducting a separate peace with Japan.
    In terms of historical precedents for allied countries signing treaties with defeated countries, peace-making is comprehensive, and there is absolutely no separate peace-making. For example, the First Treaty of Paris in 1814 and the Second Treaty of Paris in 1815 (the treaties of Britain, Austria, Russia, Prussia and other countries with France), the Treaty of Paris after the Crimean War in 1856, and the treaties signed by the Allied Powers with the defeated countries of Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey after the First World War, were all comprehensive treaties, not separate peace treaties.
    According to general international practice, drafting and signing peace treaties with defeated countries should be done by convening a peace conference of the relevant allied countries for final decision. But now American imperialism is trying to avoid convening a peace conference with Japan, and is forcing its satellite countries to sign its "draft" through so-called "correspondence" with the "majority of countries." US warmonger Dulles's three trips to Japan, as well as the negotiations conducted in the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries, were aimed at adjusting the differences of opinion among them, attempting to finalize the content of the peace treaty with Japan, and to avoid convening a peace conference. Moreover, in the "Final Clauses" of Chapter VIII of the US "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan," there is no mention of convening a peace conference. Even if the United States finally decides to convene a peace conference with Japan, in that situation, the peace conference with Japan is only a formality.
  II
    The US conspiracy to conduct separate peace-making has been going on for a long time. After the United States put forward the so-called seven principles in the "Memorandum on the Peace Treaty with Japan" in October 1950, it became even more blatant. One of the principles stipulates that the "contracting states" are: "Any or all of the countries at war with Japan willing to make peace on the basis of the proposed possibility of reaching an agreement." That is to say, countries that are unwilling to make peace with Japan on the basis of the seven principles proposed by the United States with ulterior motives are not contracting states. China and the Soviet Union are of course firmly opposed to the self-serving principles proposed by the United States, so they are excluded from the contracting states, and the United States can do whatever it wants to force its puppet states to conduct a separate peace with Japan. The US government, in its reply to the Soviet memorandum in December of the same year, openly declared that the constraint in the January 1, 1942, Declaration of Twenty-Six Nations, not to make separate peace with the enemy, was limited to "until victory is won," and that "the United States does not believe that any one country has a permanent and unchangeable power to veto other countries from concluding a peace treaty with Japan." When this "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" was put forward, the arrogant act of the United States conducting a separate peace with Japan was completely made public.
    Looking at the "Final Clauses" of Chapter VIII of the US "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan," the US conspiracy to conduct a separate peace with Japan is vividly displayed on paper. According to Article 18 of the draft: "For the purposes of this treaty, the term 'Allied Powers' shall mean those states which have been at war with Japan, or have been at war with Japan, and are parties to this treaty." According to this provision, although China and the Soviet Union fought against Japan and did not sign this treaty (we of course oppose this treaty of war preparation and enslavement of the Japanese people), they are not Allied Powers. Moreover, according to the provisions of Article 19, any country "which has not signed, ratified, or acceded to this treaty" cannot obtain "any rights, legal basis, or benefits" from Japan. China resisted Japan for eight years and suffered enormous losses. If it does not sign the treaty unilaterally formulated by American imperialism, it is not an allied country and cannot obtain "any rights, legal basis, or benefits" from Japan. This not only disregards the interests of the Chinese people but is a completely hostile act of openly challenging the Chinese people.
    American imperialism knows very well that the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union will absolutely not accept this absurd US-made treaty. Therefore, Article 21 stipulates that the treaty shall come into effect after it has been signed and ratified by Japan and a majority of countries in the Far East, including the main occupying power, the United States. If, after nine months, it has not been ratified by a majority of countries, it shall come into effect even if it is ratified by the United States alone. Is this not a clear confession of the US attempt to conduct a separate peace with Japan, or even a peace between the United States alone and Japan?
  III
    The contents of treaties signed by allied countries with defeated countries should be based on the relevant important international treaties, agreements, and declarations, and the spirit of these important international treaties, agreements, and declarations has become a principle of international law. We do not need to quote the general important international declarations and agreements signed by the allied countries during the war, but taking the content of the Potsdam Proclamation alone, it clearly stipulates the complete destruction of Japanese militarism, the complete disarmament of Japan, the dismantling of military industries, and the severe punishment of war criminals; at the same time, on the other hand, it stipulates the fostering of the revival of Japanese democratic forces and the establishment of a peaceful government in accordance with the free will of the Japanese people.
    But today, the contents of the US-made "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" completely violate the provisions of the Potsdam Proclamation. The draft plays tricks in the "Security" chapter, not only does not stipulate how to eliminate Japanese militarism and disarm Japan, but on the contrary, under the guise of allowing Japan to participate in "collective security" (!), it re-arms Japan. In the political sphere, the draft not only does not mention how to promote the democratization of Japan, but on the contrary, stipulates how to pardon and reduce the sentences of war criminals imprisoned in prisons. In the economic sphere, all the provisions in the draft are designed to enslave the Japanese people and serve the interests of American monopoly capitalists.
    Therefore, from the entire content of the US-made draft peace treaty with Japan, this is a war-preparing treaty, a treaty of enslavement of the Japanese people, and it completely violates all the international agreements signed by the allied countries during the war. Therefore, it is completely illegal and invalid. We Chinese people absolutely cannot recognize it.
    China is the country that made the most significant contribution to defeating the Japanese fascist war, and Japanese imperialism is the sworn enemy of the Chinese people. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, according to incomplete statistics, more than 10 million people were killed nationwide, and the loss of public and private property was worth about 50 billion US dollars. Therefore, we should have the greatest say in the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. However, American imperialism is now disregarding everything, deliberately excluding China and the Soviet Union, and actively conducting a separate peace with Japan. Its main purpose is to use this to openly arm Japan, turn Japan into a colony of the United States, and expand the military base for aggression against Asia, especially China. Therefore, we resolutely oppose the US separate peace with Japan and resolutely oppose the US rearming of Japan to invade and attack our China. The most effective way to oppose the US separate peace and rearming of Japan is to launch a broader and deeper great patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and to completely eliminate the US aggressor troops on the Korean battlefield.

　　美制“对日和约草案”的非法性
　　张明养
    美国政府最近发表的“对日和约草案”是完全非法的单独对日媾和活动之最露骨的和最具体的表现。所谓完全非法的意义，是指美国单独制订的这个“和约草案”，完全违反和破坏了对日问题的一切国际协定和国际法的原则。
  一
    首先我们要问：美国制订“对日和约草案”，并强迫其他同盟国家接受，是谁授权给它这样做的？对击败日本帝国主义最有重大贡献的中国没有授权给它，苏联也没有，其他同盟国也不曾有过，而美国却擅自单独制订“对日和约草案”，迫使他国接受，这是历史上所从没有过的狂妄行动。根据第二次世界大战后对战败国和约草拟签订的先例，起草和约权是属于外长会议或外长会议所授权的国家。例如莫斯科外长会议授权苏、英、美、法四国起草对意和约，苏英美三国起草对匈、保、罗三国和约，苏英两国起草对芬和约。而现在美国既未由任何国家授权，又没有任何国家的同意，片面制订了“对日和约草案”，这完全是蔑视国际惯例的荒谬绝伦的行为。
    同时，美国也违反了一九四二年一月一日二十六国宣言的规定：“每一政府承允与本宣言签字国政府合作，并不与敌国缔结单独停战协定或和约。”在这宣言上，美国以及中、苏、英、加、印、澳与新西兰等二十六个国家都签了字，而美国现在却完全破坏了自己所签字的这一重要国际宣言，进行单独对日媾和。
    就历史上同盟国家签订对战败国和约的先例来说，媾和是全面的，绝没有单独的媾和。例如一八一四年的第一次巴黎媾和条约和一八一五年的第二次巴黎媾和条约（英奥俄普等国对法和约），一八五六年克里米亚战争后的巴黎媾和条约以及第一次大战后协约国对德、奥、匈、保、土战败国家所订的和约，都是全面性的和约，而不是单独媾和。
    依照一般国际惯例，对战败国草拟签订媾和条约，总须由有关的同盟国家召开和会讨论，作最后的决定。但是现在美国帝国主义却企图避免召开对日和会，而以它的“草案”“函授”所谓“多数国家”，强迫签字。美国战争贩子杜勒斯三次日本之行，以及到菲律宾、澳洲、新西兰等国所进行的谈判，就是在调整他们之间的纷歧意见，企图完成对日和约的最后内容，来避免召开和会。并且在美国“对日和约草案”第八章的“最后条款”中，也没有关于召开和会的字样。即使美国最后仍决定召开对日和会，但在那样的情况下，对日和会也仅是一种形式罢了。
  二
    美国进行单独媾和的阴谋活动是早在进行了。而在一九五○年十月美国提出所谓七大原则的“关于对日和约的备忘录”之后，就表现得更为露骨。其中一项原则就规定“缔约国家”是：“任何或一切愿意在所建议的可能获得协议的基础上媾和的对日作战国家”。这就是说，如果不愿意在美国所建议的七大原则的基础上对日媾和的国家，就不是缔约国家。中苏两国当然是坚决反对美国所建议的别有用心的原则的，因此也就被排斥在缔约国家之外，美国便可任所欲为地强迫其仆从国家去与日本单独媾和。美国政府于同年十二月答复苏联的备忘录时更公开宣称：一九四二年一月一日二十六国宣言中不与敌国单独媾和的约束，仅限于“赢得胜利为止”，“美国并不认为任何一国有一种永久不变的权力可以否决其他国家与日本缔结和约”。到了这次“对日和约草案”提出后，美国单独对日媾和的狂妄行动就完全公开化了。
    我们就“对日和约草案”第八章“最后条款”来看，美国单独对日媾和的阴谋就活现纸上。依据草案第十八条规定：“为本条约之目的，所称盟国系指曾与日本作战或曾与日本处于战争状态，并为本条约缔约国之国家。”依据这条规定，中国和苏联虽与日本作战而不在这个和约上签字（我们当然反对这个备战的和奴役日本人民的和约），那就不是盟国。又依照第十九条的规定，凡是“未经签字，批准或加入本条约的国家”，也就不能从日本得到“任何权利、法律基础或利益”了。中国抗战八年，损失浩大，不签字于美国帝国主义片面制定的和约就不是盟国，就不能从日本得到“任何权利、法律基础或利益”，这不仅蔑视中国人民的利益而且是完全与中国人民公开挑战的敌对行为。
    美国帝国主义深知中苏二大国家是绝对不接受这个荒谬绝伦的美制和约的，因此第二十一条又规定和约经日本及远东大多数国家，包括主要占领国美国在内的签字批准，即告生效；如果隔了九个月后，没有大多数国家批准，就是美国一国批准也告生效。这不是美国企图单独对日媾和甚至美国一国与日本媾和的显明自供吗？
  三
    同盟国家与战败国签订和约，其内容应该根据有关的重要国际条约、协定和宣言，这些重要国际条约、协定和宣言的精神都已成了国际法上的原则。我们用不到去引述战时同盟国家所签订的一般性重要国际宣言和协定，单就波茨坦公告的内容来说，就明确规定了要彻底摧毁日本军国主义，完全解除日本武装，拆除军事工业，严厉惩办战犯；同时在另一方面又规定扶植日本民主势力的复兴，建立依照日本人民自由意志的和平政府。
    但是今天美制的“对日和约草案”的内容，却完全违反波茨坦公告的规定。草案在“安全”章中大耍花样，不但不规定如何肃清日本军国主义，解除日本武装，相反地，却在准许日本参加“集体安全”（！）的掩饰下，把日本重新武装起来。在政治方面，草案非但没有提到如何促进日本的民主化，却相反地规定如何把禁在狱中的战犯赦免和减刑。在经济方面，草案中的一切规定都是奴役日本人民而为美国的独占资本家的利益打算的。
    所以从整个美制对日和约草案的内容来说，这是一个备战的、奴役日本人民的和约，这是完全违反大战期间同盟国家所签订的一切国际协定的。因而它是完全非法的，而且也是无效的。我们中国人民绝对不能承认。
    中国是在击败日本法西斯战争中最有重大贡献的国家，而且日本帝国主义又是中国人民的死敌。在八年抗战中，据不完全的统计，全国损失生命在一千万人以上，公私财物损失约值五百亿美元，因此我们对于订立对日和约自应有最大的发言权。可是美国帝国主义现在竟然不顾一切，蓄意排斥中国与苏联而积极进行单独对日媾和，其主要目的就是要借此公开武装日本，变日本为美国的殖民地和扩大侵略亚洲特别是中国的军事基地。因此我们坚决反对美国单独对日媾和，坚决反对美国重新武装日本来侵略和进攻我们中国。而反对美国单独媾和、重新武装日本的最有效方法，就是更广泛和更深入地展开抗美援朝的伟大爱国运动，在朝鲜战场上彻底消灭美国侵略军。
