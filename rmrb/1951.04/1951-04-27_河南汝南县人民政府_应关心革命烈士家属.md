    The People's Government of Runan County, Henan Province, Should Care for the Families of Revolutionary Martyrs

My father, Li Xusan, went south to work in 1947 with Comrade Xuan Fuwu from this county. After arriving at the Xinyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Henan Province, he was assigned to work in Shuangmiao District, Runan County (now changed to Yangguo District). For three years, the family had no news from him. Last November, Comrade Xuan Fuwu returned home and told my family that my father heroically sacrificed himself in the struggle against the enemy less than a month after being assigned to work in Runan County. At that time, comrades Li Yingzhou, assistant of the county, An Yuanren, district chief of Shuangmiao District, Lu Xinglian, public security service member, and Duan Huating buried my father on the east bank of Daguozhuang in the district.

    After my father's sacrifice, the Runan County People's Government has not sent a letter to inform my family. We sent four or five letters, but we did not receive a reply from the Runan County Government. Therefore, I ask: Why is the Runan County People's Government so unconcerned about the families of revolutionary martyrs?

### 河南汝南县人民政府  应关心革命烈士家属

　　河南汝南县人民政府
    应关心革命烈士家属编辑同志：
    我父亲李序三，在一九四七年和本县玄福五同志一同南下工作。到河南省信阳专署后，被分配到汝南县双庙区（现已改为杨郭区）工作。三年来，家中一直没有得到他的音信。去年十一月，玄福五同志回家时告诉我家说：我父亲自分配到汝南县工作后，不到一个月，就在和敌人的斗争中壮烈地牺牲了。当时该县助理员李应周、双庙区区长安员仁、公安服务员陆兴廉、段华庭四位同志，把我父亲葬埋该区大郭庄东河沿上。
    我父亲牺牲后，汝南县人民政府迄未来信通知我家。我们去了四五次信，也未得到汝南县政府的回信。因此我问：汝南县人民政府为啥对革命烈士家属这样不关心呢？
