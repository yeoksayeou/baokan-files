Central Ministry of Heavy Industry Directs Subordinate Units to Strengthen Flood Season Prevention Work

To strengthen flood season prevention work and avoid disasters and losses in production during the rainy season, the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry specifically instructed all subordinate units on the 3rd of this month to designate this seasonal work as one of the main safety tasks, so as to guarantee the smooth completion of production tasks. The instruction pointed out:

Based on the experience of flood season prevention work in 1950, if all staff and workers can attach importance to this work, it will be possible to reduce or eliminate flood season disasters. For example, a certain ordnance factory did not experience any accidents during last year's flood season; the working hours lost by a certain factory in Tianjin in 1950 due to the rainy season were only one-seventh of those in 1949. However, some units still do not pay enough attention to this work; according to incomplete statistics, the number of disaster accidents caused by rain last year still accounted for 9.32% of the total number of disaster accidents in spring, summer, and autumn, causing considerable serious damage to finished products, materials, raw materials, important machinery and equipment, and building structures.

In order to solve this problem, the instruction emphasized the following three points, ordering all units to implement them conscientiously:

One, it is necessary to identify the key points of prevention work based on the actual conditions of the site, and first ensure that key production departments are not affected during the rainy season.

Two, all electrical equipment and lines must be thoroughly inspected; lightning protection devices should be kept in good working order.

Three, enterprises located in low-lying areas, close to the sea, rivers, or mountains and possibly subject to flash floods should pay special attention to drainage, water discharge, and flood control work.

　　中央重工业部指示所属各单位
    加强雨季防范工作
    为了加强雨季防范工作，以期避免雨季中生产上遭遇灾害、损失，中央重工业部特于本月三日指示所属各单位，将此一季节性工作定为主要安全工作之一，俾能保证生产任务的顺利完成。该指示指出：
    根据一九五○年雨季防范工作经验，全体职工如能重视这一工作，便能够减少或消灭雨季灾害。如某兵工厂在去年雨季中，没有发生任何事故；天津某厂一九五○年因雨季损失的工时，仅为一九四九年的七分之一。但仍有一些单位对此工作重视不够；根据不完全统计，去年因雨发生的灾害事故次数，仍占春、夏、秋三季灾害事故总数的百分之九·三二，使成品器材、原料、重要机器设备、房屋建筑，遭受到相当严重的损毁。
    为了解决这个问题，该指示着重提出以下三点，令各单位认真执行：
    一、必须根据现场实际情况，找出防范工作重点，首先保证生产要害部门在雨季中不受影响。
    二、一切电气设备、线路、必须彻底检修；避雷装置，尤应保持良好有效。
    三、地势低洼、靠近海、河或临近山地而可能有山洪爆发的企业单位，应特别注意排水、泄水、防汛等工作。
