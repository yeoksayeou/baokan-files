Readers and Editors

　　A Careless Error
　　Reader Qu Yichu wrote to point out that in Hua Gang's "A History of Soviet Diplomacy," published by Haiyan Bookstore in early April 1950, on page 75, the Kazakh (Kazakh Republic, Kazakh Steppe) was mistakenly written as Cossack Republic, Cossack Steppe. This mistake appears seven times on that page and the following one, proving that it was not a proofreading error.
　　We believe that this one-character oversight in the translation should be pointed out, because although Kazakh and Cossack differ by only one character, the difference is "a thousand miles."

　　An Incorrect Term
　　Shen Yuyu of the Central Youth League School wrote:
　　"In the 'Soviet Handbook' published by the 1950s Publishing House, co-translated by Wan Fu and Xu Zhe of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, in the section on 'Living Standards' (page 317), there is a passage that says: 'In fact, it will take a considerable period of time for the Soviet Union's living standards to catch up with the United States...' The author (an American) uses Molotov's speech about the per capita production of cotton fabrics, sugar, paper, and soap in 1937 as examples to illustrate his conclusion. I think this is incorrect. Since this is a book translated and edited by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, it will have a certain impact on the masses. Please consider publicly answering whether this is correct."
　　Shen's opinion is correct; the original book contains errors. The main error in the original book is confusing per capita production with living standards. The Soviet Union's per capita production of consumer goods was indeed behind the United States before the war, but the living standards of Soviet workers and peasants were much higher than those of American workers and peasants. The key is that the products of the American working people are plundered by capitalists, while the products of the Soviet working people belong to themselves and their motherland.

　　An Absurd Question
　　Chong Ren, a reader from Fushun City, wrote: "I bought a book called 'Q&A on General Knowledge of Various Subjects,' compiled by Wu Yixing and published by Beijing Minzhi Bookstore in early January 1951. On page 34 of the book, the question is asked: 'Who are China's four enemies and three friends?' This is a matter of principle.’”
　　This error is absurd. Moreover, even if it said "Who are China's four friends and three enemies," it would still be a question with unclear meaning. This book is full of errors. Similar books are also extremely mediocre. We hope that readers will be extremely cautious when buying this type of Q&A book.

　　An Intolerable Bad Book – "How to Prevent Epidemics" (written by Xiang Jinmin, published by Wentong Bookstore)
　　Reader Li Xin from Wuyi County, Hebei Province, wrote:
　　"I saw a book called 'How to Prevent Epidemics' in a private bookstore in Tianjin. At the time, I was careless and only looked at the table of contents, thinking it was easy to understand, so I bought two hundred copies for the agency's library, intending to distribute them for study. When I got back and looked at it, the book was almost entirely propaganda for American imperialism. In this small booklet of only forty-two pages, there are more than a dozen references to so-called 'American lifestyles' for promotion. In the 'Introduction,' it shamelessly says: 'Look at the lives of foreigners (here perhaps specifically referring to Americans), how comfortable and interesting they are. They live in tall buildings, it's not cold in winter, they eat the most nutritious foods, they travel by car, and few people don't have a nice car... Their lives are extremely happy, you could say they have no hardships at all...' I don't need to copy any more, in short, in the author's blind worship, everything about America is good. The author completely forgets the increasingly difficult lives of the American working people under the heavy pressure of reactionary capitalists. If this were an old edition, we could look at it from a different perspective. However, the copyright page of this book clearly states that it is the third edition of September 1950, and there is also a preface by the editor-in-chief, Ye Weifa, 'Shanghai, August 1950.' During this period, our great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea had already begun throughout the country, and Wentong Bookstore still brought out such an intolerable bad book for republication, and it is still being sold today. This is simply unbelievable. When I bought these two hundred books, the bookstore also said, 'Goods once sold are not returnable.' Is this attitude of simply seeking profit and not taking responsibility correct? I am reporting this matter, hoping you can tell me what kind of action I should take."
　　Li also attached a copy of the book to us, and we completely agree with his opinion: this is an intolerable bad book. Wentong Bookstore should conduct a strict review of this matter and should recall all copies of the book that have been sold.

  一个字的疏忽
    读者瞿轶初君来信指出华岗著、海燕书店一九五○年四月初版的《苏联外交史》七十五页将哈萨克（卡查赫共和国、哈萨克（卡查赫）草原，都误为哥萨克共和国、哥萨克草原，在这一页和接连的一页先后凡七见，足证不是校勘之误。
    我们以为这一译名上一个字的疏忽也是应该指出的，因为哈萨克与哥萨克虽然只是一字之差，然而却是“谬以千里”的。
  一个用语的错误
    中央团校沈育禹君来信说：
    “在五十年代出版社出版的、中苏友好协会总会莞夫、徐哲同志合译的《苏联手册》中‘在生活水准一节中（书三一七页），有一段说：事实上苏联的生活水准要追上美国，还得经历一个相当长的时期……’，作者（一个美国人）拿了莫洛托夫关于一九三七年的演辞中的棉织品、糖、纸、肥皂的个人生产量作为例子说明他的结论。我想这是不正确的。由于这是中苏友好协会总会翻译、编辑的一本书，会对群众有一定的影响，是否正确，请你们考虑公开答复。”
    沈君所提意见是正确的，原书有错误。原书主要错误在混淆个人生产量与生活水平为一事。苏联个人消费品生产量在战前确属落后于美国，但苏联工人农民的生活水平则远较美国的工农生活水平为高。关键在于美国劳动人民的生产品为资本家掠夺去了，而苏联劳动人民的生产品则是属于自己及祖国所有的。
  一个荒唐的问题
    抚顺市读者崇仁来信：“我买了一本书，该书名是《各科常识问答》，伍宜兴编著，北京民智书店一九五一年一月初版。该书第三四页中提出问题说：‘什么是中国的四个敌人和三个朋友？’‘这是原则错误。’”
    这错误是荒唐的。而且即便说“什么是中国的四个朋友和三个敌人”，也是文意不明的问题。这本书是错误百出的。同类的书也都极不高明。希望读者在购买这一类常识问答的书时，必须极端审慎。
  一本不能容忍的坏书——《怎样防疫》（向近敏著文通书局版）
    河北武邑县读者李欣来信：
    “我在天津一家私营书店看到一本《怎样防疫》的书，当时因粗心，只看了下目录，认为通俗，便替机关图书室买了二百本，准备分发学习。回来一看，该书差不多是全部替美帝国主义宣传的。在仅仅四十二页的这本小册子中，引证所谓‘美国生活方式’来宣传的达十几处，在‘开场白’中甚至于无耻地说：‘你看外国人的生活（这里或许是专指美国人），多么舒服，多有趣味，住的是高楼大厦，冬天不冷，吃的是最有营养的食品，他们走路是以汽车代步，很少人没有一部漂亮的小汽车……他们生活快乐极了，可说一点苦处亦没有……’不用再抄下去了，总之一句话，在作者的盲目崇拜中，美国什么都是好的。作者完全忘记了美国劳动人民在反动资本家重压下生活日益困苦的情形。如果这是一本旧版书，我们还可以用另一个角度去看它。然而这一本书的版权页上明显地著录出一九五○年九月三版，另外还有一页主编人叶维法‘一九五○年八月于上海’的序文。在这一时期，我们全国范围内已经开始了抗美援朝的伟大运动了，文通书局还把这样一本不能容忍的坏书拿来再版，而且一直到今天还在发卖，这简直是不可思议的事。我买这二百本书时，书店还说‘货物出门，概不退换’，这种单纯牟利、不负责任的态度是对的吗？我反映这一件事，希望你们告诉我应该采取怎样的处置。”
    李君还附了一本书给我们，我们完全同意他的意见：这是一本不能容忍的坏书。文通书局对这件事应该进行严格的检讨，并应该把这本书已售出的全部收回。
