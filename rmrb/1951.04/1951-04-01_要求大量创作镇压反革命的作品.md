　　Request for a Large Number of Works on Suppressing Counter-revolutionaries
To the Editors:
    Our literary and art workers have already made many efforts and achieved considerable success in reflecting the great, arduous, and victorious struggles of the people of our motherland, which is beyond doubt. But can this completely satisfy the demands of the masses? I think it is not enough. Some major domestic events do not seem to have been of concern to capable professional writers as creative subjects. For example, in the major task of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and exposing the conspiracies of American imperialism, the public security departments have victoriously completed many important achievements worthy of praise. The news published in the newspapers about this has given the people infinite encouragement, and people from all walks of life have applauded and praised it, considering it a great achievement in the great struggle to resist America and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country. But have our writers paid attention to these materials? We suggest that the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and other relevant organs and groups organize a group of literary and art workers to reflect such major international espionage cases as the recent capture in Tianjin in films or dramas, in order to expose the enemy's conspiracies and educate the broad masses of the people. We look forward to seeing works like the Soviet film "Secret Envoy" and the play "In a Certain Country" (also known as the film "Conspiracy") appear in the motherland's literary and artistic works.

　　要求大量创作镇压反革命的作品编辑同志：
    我们的文艺工作者，在反映祖国人民伟大的，艰苦的，胜利的斗争中，已经做了很多努力，并有了不少成就，这是无庸置疑的。但是不是能够完全满足群众的要求呢？我认为还是不够的。国内发生的一些重大事件，似乎还没有被有能力的专业作家所关心和注意，作为创作题材。如在镇压反革命和揭露美帝国主义阴谋这一重大任务中，人民公安部门的工作曾胜利地完成了很多值得歌颂的重要业迹。发表在报纸上有关这方面的消息，给人民以无限鼓舞，各界人民都拍手称快，认为是抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大斗争中的巨大收获。但这些材料是否被我们的作家重视了呢？我们建议中央人民政府文化部、全国文学艺术界联合会等有关机关、团体组织一批文艺工作者把像最近在天津捕获的这样重大的国际间谍案反映到电影或戏剧中去，以揭露敌人阴谋，教育广大人民。我们期待着有像苏联电影《秘密使节》戏剧《在某一国家内》（也即电影《阴谋》）这样的作品出现在祖国文艺作品中。
