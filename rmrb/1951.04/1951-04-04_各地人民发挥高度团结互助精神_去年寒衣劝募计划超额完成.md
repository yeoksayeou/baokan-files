　　People Across the Country Displayed a High Degree of Unity and Mutual Assistance
　　Last Year's Winter Clothing Donation Plan Was Overfulfilled
The national campaign to solicit winter clothing for disaster victims, which took place last winter, has concluded. The General Offices for Winter Clothing Donation for Disaster Victims in Northern Anhui, Northern Jiangsu, Hebei, and Henan held their second meeting in Beijing on March 14 to summarize the experiences of carrying out this campaign.

Last year's national campaign to solicit winter clothing for disaster victims, with the enthusiastic support of the people across the country, governments at all levels, local relief organizations, mass organizations, democratic parties, and people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about relief, collected a total of 6,887,561 sets of winter clothing in a very short period. This is equivalent to more than 340 billion yuan in RMB, exceeding the original plan of 6 million sets by more than 13 percent. This not only solved the problem of the lack of winter clothing for disaster victims in severely affected areas such as Northern Anhui and some urban poor, but also assisted the suffering people of Korea. A total of 5,210,750 sets of winter clothing were distributed to disaster victims in Northern Anhui, Northern Jiangsu, Hebei, and Henan. Various regions retained 1,177,895 sets of winter clothing for local relief of the poor and disaster victims who migrated from other places. Aid to Korean refugees included 20 billion yuan in lieu of winter clothing and 10,000 sets of winter clothing.

People from all over the country fully demonstrated the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, and friendship in this movement. For example, in Shanghai, an average of about five people donated a set of winter clothing. In other provinces, regions, or cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Zhejiang, Northern Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Western Sichuan, Henan, Pingyuan, Ningxia, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Shenyang, Lushun-Dalian, Fushun, Anshan, and Chongqing, the amount of donations exceeded the original plan. The ethnic minorities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also voluntarily donated more than 870 million yuan, as well as clothing and food. This fact fully proves the correctness of the social mutual assistance policy of our Central People's Government and the improvement of the Chinese people's political consciousness.

　　各地人民发挥高度团结互助精神        
    去年寒衣劝募计划超额完成
    去年冬季全国规模的劝募灾民寒衣运动业已结束。皖北、苏北、河北、河南灾民寒衣劝募总会于三月十四日在北京召开第二次会议，总结了开展这次运动的经验。
    去年全国劝募灾民寒衣运动，在全国人民和各级人民政府、各地救济机关、群众团体、民主党派及各界热心救济人士的热烈支持下，在很短时期内，共募得寒衣六百八十八万七千五百六十一套，折合人民币三千四百多亿元，超过原订计划六百万套的百分之十三以上。这不仅解决了皖北等地重灾区灾民及部分城市贫民的缺乏寒衣的困难，并援助了朝鲜的受难人民。计共分配给皖北、苏北、河北、河南等地灾民寒衣五百二十一万零七百五十套，各地区留用救济当地贫民及外地迁入的灾民共寒衣一百一十七万七千八百九十五套，救济朝鲜难民共寒衣代金二百亿元及寒衣一万套。
    全国各地人民在这一运动中，均充分地表现了团结、互助和友爱的精神。如上海市平均约五个人捐出寒衣一套。其他如北京、天津、浙江、苏北、陕西、川西、河南、平原、宁夏、南京、广州、西安、沈阳、旅大、抚顺、鞍山、重庆等省、区或市，募集数量均超过原订计划。内蒙古自治区的少数民族亦自动地捐献了八亿七千多万元和衣物、粮食等。这一事实充分证明了我中央人民政府社会互济政策的正确性，和中国人民政治觉悟的提高。
