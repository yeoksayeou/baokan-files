　　Sixty-eight Townships in the Suburbs of Guangzhou
    Victoriously Complete Land Reform
    The land reform in sixty-eight townships in the suburbs of Guangzhou, which began in mid-December of last year and lasted for three and a half months, has now been victoriously completed. In the entire suburban land reform, a total of more than 83,000 mu of landlords' land was confiscated and public fields and ancestral hall fields were requisitioned, along with a total of more than 14,000 mu of rented land from rich peasants and agricultural land in the suburbs owned by industrialists and merchants. All agricultural land confiscated and requisitioned is owned by the state. The majority of this land, after setting aside a small portion for the establishment of state-owned farms and municipal construction, has been fairly and reasonably distributed to landless and land-poor farmers in the suburbs for cultivation. More than 200 head of cattle, more than 70,000 pieces of farm implements, and surplus grain and houses confiscated from the landlords have also been distributed to poor farmers who lacked these means of production and means of subsistence. After the farmers received land to cultivate, their enthusiasm for production greatly increased. Under the leadership of the suburban farmers' associations, they have formulated a patriotic production pact for the entire suburbs, striving to increase agricultural production by 10 percent this year. In order to complete this great production increase plan, farmers in various townships are busy turning the fields, accumulating fertilizer, adding farm implements, and making other preparations for spring plowing. Quansheng, Heji, and three other small farm implement factories in Lijiao Township are busy from early morning to late at night every day, but they still cannot meet the needs of farmers' orders. Workers at the Quansheng factory happily said, "Farmers have turned themselves around with land reform, and we have also become busy."
    After a series of struggles such as rent reduction, anti-local tyrant and land reform, the political awareness of the farmers in the suburbs of Guangzhou has been increasing day by day. At present, the membership of the suburban farmers' associations has reached 35,000, and the militia has also greatly developed. The organizations of the New Democratic Youth League and the Democratic Women's Federation have also been generally established in various townships. After the completion of the suburban land reform on March 31, the farmers held a rally of more than 50,000 people in the urban area to celebrate the victory of land reform and oppose the U.S. imperialism arming Japan.

　　广州市郊区六十八个乡
    胜利完成土地改革
    广州市郊区六十八个乡的土地改革，自去年十二月中旬开始，历时三个半月，现已全部胜利结束。全郊区土地改革中，共没收地主土地和征收公田、祠堂田八万三千多亩，并征收了富农的出租土地和工商业家在郊区的农业土地等共一万四千亩。没收和征收得来的农业土地一律归国家所有。将这些土地除留出少部分作为建立国营农场和市政建设之用外，绝大部分已公平合理地分配给郊区无地少地的农民耕种。其他没收地主的二百多头耕牛，七万多件农具和多余的粮食、房屋等，亦全部分配给缺乏这些生产资料和生活资料的贫苦农民。农民分得土地耕种以后，生产情绪极为高涨。他们在郊区农民协会领导下，已订出了全郊区的爱国生产公约，争取今年农业增产百分之十。为了完成这一个伟大的增产计划，各乡农民正在忙着翻田、积肥、添置农具和作其他有关春耕的准备工作。沥滘乡全胜、合记等五家小型农具工厂，每天从清早忙到深夜，但仍供应不上农民订货的需要。全胜工厂工人们高兴地说：“土地改革农民翻了身，我们也忙起来了。”
    广州市郊区农民经过减租、反恶霸和土地改革等一系列的斗争，政治觉悟日益提高。现全郊区农民协会会员已达三万五千人，民兵武装也得到很大发展，新民主主义青年团和民主妇女联合会的组织也都在各乡普遍建立起来。三月三十一日郊区土地改革全部完成后，农民曾在市区内举行了五万多人的庆祝土地改革胜利暨反对美帝国主义武装日本的大会。（新华社）
