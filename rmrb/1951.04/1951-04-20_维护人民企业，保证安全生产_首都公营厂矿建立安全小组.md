　　Uphold People's Enterprises, Ensure Safe Production
　  Security Groups Established in Public Factories and Mines in the Capital
    Security groups in public factories and mines in the capital began to be established gradually in April 1950. As of March of this year, according to incomplete statistics from nine factories and mines, 357 groups have been established, including 2,182 members, accounting for approximately 10 percent of the total number of employees. Over the past year, security groups have played a leading and guaranteeing role in implementing regulations, preventing accidents, exposing bad elements, and cooperating with the administration to complete the central tasks of each period.

    In terms of implementing regulations and complying with labor discipline: Before the establishment of security groups in the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, the system was very unsound, and even when there were regulations, they could not be well implemented, resulting in repeated thefts and incidents of responsibility. For example, one night, due to a power outage, workers left work without turning off the power switch. When the power came back on, the machine started running unattended. Sometimes, the machine room doors were wide open after workers left at night. Temporary workers would sometimes go to sleep on the machine tools. Due to lax inspections by the gatekeepers, merchants often wandered around the factory. Since the establishment of the security group in October, a system of visits, gatekeepers, and dedicated machine responsibility has gradually been established. Thanks to the leading role of the security group members, no major accidents have occurred in the past three months. At the Shijingshan Power Plant, the Li Fengming group earned the title of model safe operation group by conscientiously implementing the machine inspection system, and no accidents occurred in eleven months. Over the past year, various safety responsibility systems, such as reporting, visits, gatekeepers, reception of guests, overnight stays, shift handover, inspection, dedicated machine responsibility, labor agreements, contact contracts, and apprentice contracts, have generally been established in various factories and mines, reducing the opportunity for sabotage by bad elements and ensuring the safety of production and employees.

    In terms of preventing accidents: During the New Record Movement in May of last year, Chen Shutang, the security group leader of the Iron Smelting Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, called on the group members to pick up explosives. From October 1950 to February 25, 1951, in four months, a total of 13 mortar shells, 17 detonators, 3 hand grenades, 2 grenade launcher shells, and 16 bullets were picked up. If they had not been picked up in time, many accidents would have occurred. From June to August of last year, the department had no less than 20 work-related injuries per month. During the New Record Movement, there was only one work-related injury in September and October.

    They have also played a significant role in exposing bad elements. For example, on February 1, 1950, security group members Chu Youcai, Zhang Limin, and Song Wenying of the Shijingshan Power Plant discovered and stopped the anti-revolutionary saboteur Li Xiutian, who committed the crime of sabotaging four high-pressure furnaces in one night (the perpetrator has been arrested and brought to justice), ensuring the safe operation of Unit 5.

    Regarding cooperating with the administration to complete central tasks: The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Shijingshan Power Plant launched an anti-waste movement in mid-February. When the warehouse security group led by Shi Zenrun inventoried the materials, they moved a large number of valuable materials that had been exposed to rain and sun into the warehouse, and cleared out 1143 kinds of off-the-books items worth 2.5 billion yuan.

    However, some factory and mine leaders do not pay enough attention to the work of the security groups, and lack organizational leadership and education for the security group members. Some group members believe that security work is an extra burden, and their ideological awareness has not kept up with the actual needs. Some security groups still have impure elements. In addition, timely commendation is insufficient, so some groups have become mere formalities. For example, only eight of the thirty security group members of the Mentougou Electromechanical Plant reported any situations.

    In order to strengthen security work, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the ideological and professional knowledge education of the group members, consolidate the organization, and purify the internal structure. In addition, clarifying the tasks and proposing different specific tasks according to different situations and the central work of each period, as well as timely praise and criticism, are good methods for consolidating and improving the security groups.

### 维护人民企业，保证安全生产  首都公营厂矿建立安全小组

　　维护人民企业，保证安全生产
　  首都公营厂矿建立安全小组
    首都公营工厂、矿山的安全小组，从一九五○年四月开始逐渐建立，截至今年三月止，据九个工厂、矿山不完全统计，已建立小组三百五十七个，包括组员二千一百八十二名，约占职工总数百分之十。一年来，安全小组在执行制度、防止事故、检举坏分子、配合行政完成每个时期的中心任务上，是起了带头与保证作用的。
    在执行制度与遵守劳动纪律方面：华北农业机械厂未建立安全小组以前，制度很不健全，有制度亦不能很好执行，屡次发生偷盗及责任事故。如：有一天晚上，因为停电，工人下班，但未关电闸，来电时机器开动，没有人管；晚上工人下班后，有时机房四门大开；夜间临时工跑到机床上去睡觉；由于门卫检查不严，商人时常进厂乱串。自十月建立安全小组后，逐渐建立了参观、门卫、机器专责制，由于安全组员的带头作用，三个月来始终未发生大的事故。石景山发电厂由于李凤鸣小组认真地执行了机器检查制度，十一个月未发生事故，取得了安全运转小组的模范称号。一年来，各工厂矿山一般的建立了报告、参观、门卫、会客、留宿、接交班、检查、机器专责、劳动公约、联系合同、师徒合同等各种安全责任制度，减少了坏分子破坏的机会，保证了生产及职工的安全。
    在防止事故方面：石景山钢铁厂炼铁部在去年五月新纪录运动中，陈树棠安全组长号召组员拣爆炸物，从一九五○年十月至一九五一年二月二十五日四个月中，共拣出迫击炮弹十三个、雷管十七个、手榴弹三枚、掷弹筒弹两枚、子弹十六粒，如不及时拣出来，将引起许多事故。该部去年六月至八月每月公伤不下二十人，在新纪录运动中，九、十两月只有一次公伤。
    在检举坏分子方面，也起了很大作用。如一九五○年二月一日，石景山发电厂安全组员褚右才、张利民、宋文英发现并制止了反革命破坏分子李秀田，一夜破坏四次高压炉（该犯已逮捕法办）的罪行，保住了五号机的安全运转。
    关于配合行政完成中心任务方面：石景山钢、电两厂，二月中开展了反浪费运动。仓库史增润安全小组在清点物资时，将大批被雨淋日晒的贵重器材搬入仓库，并清出账外物品一一四三种，价值二十五亿元。
    但是，各工厂、矿山领导上对安全小组工作有的还重视不够，对安全组员缺乏组织领导与教育。有的组员认为进行保安工作是额外负担，思想觉悟还赶不上实际需要；有些保安小组内仍有不纯分子。再加领导上及时表扬不够，因而有的小组流于形式。如门头沟机电厂三十个保安组员，只有八个人反映一些情况。
    为了加强保安工作，今后须继续加强对组员思想和业务知识的教育，巩固组织、纯洁内部。此外明确任务，根据不同情况和每一个时期的中心工作，提出不同的具体任务，及时进行表扬与批评，也是巩固与提高安全小组很好的方法。
