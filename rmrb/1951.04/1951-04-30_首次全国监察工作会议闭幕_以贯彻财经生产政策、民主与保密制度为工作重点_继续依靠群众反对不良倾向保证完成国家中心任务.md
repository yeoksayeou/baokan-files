　　Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: The first National Supervisory Work Conference of the People's Supervision Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government concluded on the 22nd, lasting ten days. The conference summarized the people's supervisory work in 1950 and determined the work tasks for 1951. After detailed discussions, the conference determined the basic methods of supervisory work. The conference also studied and discussed six chapters of rules and regulations.

　　At the beginning of the meeting, Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government Committee, Chen Yun and Huang Yanpei, Vice Premiers of the State Council, Li Liuru, Deputy Chief Procurator of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and Zhang Zhirang, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, attended and delivered speeches. They unanimously pointed out that the people's supervisory work has made great achievements in the past year and has been of great help to the work of various departments. In the future, the role of the people's supervisory organs should be further brought into play, and cadres should be actively helped and educated to be honest and law-abiding, and to do their work conscientiously and responsibly.

　　The conference listened to and discussed the report by Tan Pingshan, Director of the Central People's Supervision Committee, on the summary of the people's supervisory work in 1950 and the work tasks for 1951, the report by Deputy Director Liu Jingfan on several issues in supervisory work, and the report by Deputy Director Pan Zhenya on the drafting and modification process of several regulations, measures, and general rules.

　　The conference believed that the people's supervisory work has been successful in the past year. People's supervisory organizations at all levels have been initially established. As of now, people's supervisory committees have been established in five major administrative regions, one central-level autonomous region, twenty-eight provinces, twelve central or major administrative region-administered cities, eight administrative regions equivalent to provinces, and three hundred and forty-five counties (cities, banners). In the past year, people's supervisory committees at all levels have handled a total of 7,309 accident cases and conducted more than thirty routine inspections. Most of the problems discovered in all accidents and routine inspections have been dealt with. In the past year, the people's supervisory organs have inspected and reported on the unhealthy tendencies of state organs and public officials, improved their work, and educated cadres, thereby safeguarding state policies, laws, and systems.

　　The conference believed that the task of the people's supervisory work in 1951 is to focus on implementing financial, economic, and production policies, democratic systems, and state confidentiality systems, based on the current central tasks of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, production and construction, and democratic construction. It should continue to fight against irresponsible bureaucracy, violations of law and discipline, corruption, extravagance, and acting one way in public and another in private among state organs and public officials. At the same time, it should be more vigilant and pay attention to reporting hidden counter-revolutionary elements to ensure the smooth completion of the national central tasks. The conference decided that supervisory organs at all levels should formulate their specific tasks according to the above priorities and the specific conditions of each locality.

　　The conference believed that the supervisory organizations at all levels have not yet been universally established, and those that have been established are not yet sound; there are few cadres for supervisory work, and there is not much work experience. Therefore, the basic method of the current people's supervisory work is to concentrate forces, grasp the key points, oppose the main unhealthy tendencies, gain experience, and promote the overall situation. The conference believed that to do a good job in the people's supervisory work, it is also necessary to correctly use the method of combining leadership with the masses and follow the mass line; the masses must be mobilized to participate in inspection work; a system of supervisory correspondents should be established and suggestion boxes should be set up to listen to the opinions of the people and earnestly handle the accusations of the people.

　　Regarding the establishment and improvement of supervisory organizations at all levels, the conference believed that in order to concentrate efforts to first do a good job in the supervisory work of county-level and above and major enterprise departments, the current focus should be on establishing supervisory organizations in special districts. The county (city) supervisory organizations that have been established should strengthen their leadership; those that have not been established will not be established for the time being. A guiding relationship should be established for the supervisory organizations of certain business departments as a trial, and then gradually developed after gaining experience.

　　After detailed discussions, the participating representatives more clearly understood the nature, powers, and functions of the people's supervisory work ideologically. The people's supervisory work is an integral part of the people's democratic power, representing the government in exercising the power of supervision and impeachment to ensure that state organs faithfully and responsibly implement state policies and decrees. The powers of the supervisory organs are to supervise the conscientious implementation of all state organs and public officials in accordance with the government's policies, laws, resolutions, and plans, and to impeach the organs and personnel who violate the law or neglect their duties.

　　The conference also discussed the relationship and division of labor between the upper and lower levels of the supervisory organs, the relationship between the supervisory organs and various departments, and the punishment of cadres. In addition, the conference also studied the general rules for the organization of the People's Supervision Committees of the People's Governments of the major administrative regions, provinces (cities), and counties (cities).

　　The conference was summarized by Deputy Director Liu Jingfan. He pointed out that the supervisory committees at all levels should organize their forces well and carry out their work in accordance with the guidelines and tasks determined by this conference; at the same time, they should pay attention to reporting counter-revolutionary elements hidden in government agencies to ensure the smooth completion of the state's central tasks. Regarding the basic methods of supervisory work, Deputy Director Liu pointed out that to do a good job in supervisory work, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses of the people to participate and rely on the strength of the masses. When carrying out supervisory work, do not simply emphasize the power of the supervisory organs and neglect cooperation with the competent authorities and relevant departments, which will affect the work results. Supervisory work is still a new work, and there are still many difficulties. We must rely on everyone to work hard, overcome difficulties, study hard, be conscientious and responsible, live plainly and frugally, and serve the people loyally to do this work well.

　　Peng Zhen, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee of the State Council, attended the meeting and spoke before its conclusion. He said that the People's Government should not only have policies, laws, and work plans, but more importantly, how to ensure their implementation. The People's Supervisory Organs are specialized organs responsible for this task, so their work is very important. He emphasized that the people's supervisory work should be carried out in a big way, focusing on fighting against the main unhealthy tendencies that currently exist in the work. Supervisory work should follow the mass line, coming from the masses and going to the masses.

　　首次全国监察工作会议闭幕
　  以贯彻财经生产政策、民主与保密制度为工作重点
　  继续依靠群众反对不良倾向保证完成国家中心任务
    【新华社二十八日讯】中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会第一次全国监察工作会议，历时十天，已于二十二日结束。会议总结了一九五○年的人民监察工作，确定了一九五一年的工作任务。会议经过详尽讨论后，确定了监察工作的基本方法。会议还研究和讨论了六个章则条例。
    会议开始，中央人民政府委员会秘书长林伯渠，政务院副总理陈云、黄炎培，最高人民检察署副检察长李六如，最高人民法院副院长张志让等均出席讲话。他们一致指出：一年来人民监察工作是有很大成绩的，对各部门工作帮助很大。今后要进一步发挥人民监察机关的作用，积极地帮助和教育干部奉公守法，认真负责地做好工作。
    会议听取和讨论了中央人民监察委员会谭平山主任关于一九五○年人民监察工作总结及一九五一年工作任务的报告，刘景范副主任关于监察工作中几个问题的报告，潘震亚副主任关于几个条例、办法、通则起草与修改经过的报告。
    会议认为：一年来人民监察工作是有成绩的。各级人民监察机构已初步建立。截至现在止，已有五个大行政区、一个中央辖自治区、二十八个省、十二个中央或大行政区辖市、八个等于省的行政区和三百四十五个县（市、旗）成立了人民监察委员会。各级人民监察委员会一年来共处理事故案件七千三百零九件，进行了平时检查三十余起。全部事故及平时检查中发现的问题，大部已处理完毕。一年来，人民监察机关对国家机关和公务人员中的不良倾向进行了检查和检举，改进了工作，教育了干部，从而维护了国家政策、法令和制度。
    会议认为：一九五一年人民监察工作的任务是依据当前抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命、生产建设、民主建设等中心任务，以贯彻财经生产政策、民主制度、国家保密制度为重点，继续与国家机关及公务人员中不负责任的官僚主义及违法乱纪、贪污腐化、铺张浪费、阳奉阴违等不良倾向作斗争，同时应提高警惕，注意检举潜伏的反革命分子，保证国家中心任务的顺利完成。会议决定：各级监察机关应根据以上重点，按各地具体情况规定其具体任务。
    会议认为：目前各级监察机构尚未普遍建立，已建立的还不够健全；监察工作的干部较少，工作经验不多。因此，当前人民监察工作的基本方法是：集中力量，抓住要害，反对主要的不良倾向，取得经验，推动全局。会议认为要做好人民监察工作，还必须正确地运用领导与群众相结合的方法，走群众路线；在检查工作时必须发动群众参加；应建立监察通讯员制度和设立意见箱等，听取人民群众的意见，认真地处理人民群众的控告。
    关于各级监察机构的建立和健全问题，会议认为：为了集中力量首先做好县级以上和主要企业部门的监察工作，目前的重点应放在建立专区的监察机构上。县（市）监察机构已建立者，应加强其领导；未建立者，暂不建立。对某些业务部门的监察机构，应建立指导关系，作为试办，待取得经验后，再逐步发展。
    经过详尽的讨论，与会各代表在思想上更明确地认识了人民监察工作的性质、职权和作用。人民监察工作是人民民主政权的组成部分，代表政府行使监督和纠举的职权以保障国家机关忠实负责地贯彻执行国家政策、法令。监察机关的职权是依据政府的政策、法令、决议、计划，监督一切国家机关和公务人员认真执行，并纠举其中违法失职的机关和人员。
    会议还讨论了监察机关上下级的关系和分工，监察机关与各部门的关系以及干部惩戒等问题。此外，会议还研究了大行政区、省（市）、县（市）人民政府人民监察委员会组织通则。
    会议由刘景范副主任作总结报告。他指出：各级监委应很好地组织力量，根据这次会议所确定的方针和任务，进行工作；同时注意检举潜藏在政府机关中的反革命分子，以保证国家各项中心任务的顺利完成。关于监察工作的基本方法问题，刘副主任指出：要做好监察工作，必须发动广大人民群众参加，依靠群众的力量。在执行监察工作时，不要单纯强调监察机关的权力而忽略了与主管机关和有关部门的合作，致影响了工作效果。监察工作还是一个新的工作，困难还很多，要靠大家在具体工作中，努力克服困难，好好地学习，认真负责，艰苦朴素，忠诚地为人民服务，才能做好这个工作。
    政务院政治法律委员会副主任彭真在会议结束前到会讲话。他说：人民政府不仅要有政策、法令和工作计划，更重要的是如何保证其贯彻执行。人民监察机关就是负责此项任务的专门机关，故其工作是非常重要的。他着重指出：人民监察工作要大张旗鼓地进行，有重点地对目前工作中存在的主要不良倾向进行斗争。监察工作要走群众路线，从群众中来，到群众中去。
