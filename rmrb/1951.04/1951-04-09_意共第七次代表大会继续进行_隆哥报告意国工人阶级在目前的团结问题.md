Xinhua News Agency, Rome: The Seventh National Congress of the Italian Communist Party, which opened in Rome on April 3rd, is continuing.

　　At the afternoon session on the 3rd, Longo, Deputy Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party, made a report on "The Unity of the Working Class in the Current Situation." Longo summarized the work of various mass organizations, trade unions, farmers' associations, cooperatives, women's and youth organizations, and peace committees. He pointed out that the signing of the Stockholm Appeal by 17 million people and the establishment of 20,000 peace committees proved that the government's attempt to isolate the working class and its parties from other people had completely failed. Although the Christian Democratic Party and the right-wing Social Democratic Party have attempted to split the trade union movement three times, the majority of workers are still organized in the General Confederation of Labor. He also criticized some weaknesses existing in the work of trade unions and factories, and pointed out the direction for correction. The congress then discussed the reports of Togliatti and Longo. Amendola, secretary of the Campania district committee, spoke first, talking about the issue of carrying out the struggle to develop the economy of southern Italy.

　　The meeting on the 4th continued to discuss the reports of Togliatti and Longo. Speakers included Bellinger, Secretary of the Italian Communist Youth League, Spano, member of the Political Bureau of the Italian Communist Party, and Rossi, Chairman of the Women's Federation. Bellinger said that 7% of young people in Italy between the ages of 14 and 18 have joined the Communist Youth League. Rossi said that the number of people participating in the Italian Women's Federation has increased from 35,000 in 1948 to 1,052,000 in 1950.

　　At the morning session on the 5th, Xie Jia, Deputy Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party, spoke, stating that the party's task is to mobilize all its strength so that the party's influence reaches not only the majority of the working class, but also all the people. He criticized some of the shortcomings existing in the party's work, and emphasized the necessity of training party cadres to do mass work, so that every active party member can participate in practical struggles and solve the fundamental problems of all strata of the people. He also pointed out that the way to carry out work among the masses who are still influenced by reactionary parties and groups must become more lively, must not be limited to superficial debates and propaganda, but must set goals, win over most of the members of these groups, and break their ties with their reactionary leaders. When talking about the party's organizational tasks, Xie Jia raised the issue of increasing the party's staff and strengthening the party's work in southern Italy and the Venice region in the coming months.

　　The congress has been reading out telegrams of congratulations from the Central Committees of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), the Communist Party of China, the Korean Workers' Party, the Communist Party of the United States, the French Communist Party, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, and the Communist and Workers' Parties of Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Albania with extremely enthusiastic sentiments for several days.

　　意共第七次代表大会继续进行
  　隆哥报告意国工人阶级在目前的团结问题
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：四月三日在罗马开幕的意大利共产党第七次全国代表大会正在继续进行中。
    三日下午会议上，意共副总书记隆哥作了关于《工人阶级在目前情况中的团结》的报告。隆哥总结了各群众组织、工会、农会、合作社、妇女和青年组织以及和平委员会的工作。他指出，一千七百万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名与二万个和平委员会的建立证明，政府想把工人阶级及其政党孤立于其他人民之外的企图，是完全失败了。虽然基督教民主党与右翼社会民主党三次企图分裂工会运动，但是，大多数工人仍然组织在总工会里。他同时批评了工会工作与工厂工作中存在的某些弱点，并指出了纠正的方向。大会接着讨论托里亚蒂和隆哥的报告。卡潘尼亚区区委书记亚门多拉首先发言，他谈到了关于进行争取发展意大利南部经济的斗争的问题。
    四日会议继续讨论托里亚蒂和隆哥的报告，发言的有意大利共产主义青年团书记比林格尔、意共中央政治局委员斯巴诺及妇联主席罗西。比林格尔说，意大利现在十四岁到十八岁的青年已有百分之七参加了共产主义青年团。罗西说，参加意大利妇联的人数已由一九四八年的三万五千人增加到一九五○年的一百零五万二千人。
    在五日上午会议上，意共副总书记谢嘉发言，他提出：党的任务是动员党的全部力量，使党的影响不仅及于工人阶级的大多数，而且及于全体人民。他批评了党的工作中所存在的一些缺点，强调指出培养党的干部作群众工作，使每一个积极的党员能够参加实际斗争，解决一切阶层人民的根本问题的必要性。他并且指出，在仍然受反动党派与团体影响的群众中进行工作，其方式必须变得更加活泼，必须不仅限于表面的辩论和宣传，而是要立定目标，把这些团体中大部分的成员争取过来，并使他们和他们的反动领导砍断联系。在谈到党的组织任务时，谢嘉提出了在最近几个月内增加党的工作人员和加强党在意大利南部及威尼斯区的工作的问题。
    大会连日都以极度热烈的情绪宣读了苏联共产党（布）、中国共产党、朝鲜劳动党、美国共产党、法国共产党、蒙古人民革命党、及捷、保、匈、阿尔巴尼亚等国共产党及工人党的中央委员会的贺电。
