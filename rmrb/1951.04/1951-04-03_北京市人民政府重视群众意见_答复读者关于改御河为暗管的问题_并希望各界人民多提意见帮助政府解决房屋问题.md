　　The Beijing Municipal People's Government Attaches Importance to Public Opinion
    Responds to Reader's Question Regarding Converting the Yu River into an Underground Pipe
    and Hopes People from All Walks of Life Will Offer More Suggestions to Help the Government Solve Housing Problems
To the Editorial Department,
Please forward to Mayor Peng:
    The Beijing Municipal People's Government has already achieved great results in constructing urban roads and dredging ditches. The citizens are very grateful!
    The sewage ditch between Donghua Gate East Riverbank and West Riverbank has a foul odor when the weather is hot. If it could be connected to an underground pipe and a road built over it, it would not only benefit public health but also facilitate traffic.
    This is a small suggestion, and I hope you will adopt it.
                             All Students of the Third Hospital of Peking University, Wang Mingcheng, et al.
To the Editorial Department,
Please forward to All Students of the Third Hospital of Peking University, Wang Mingcheng, et al.:
    Your letter to Mayor Peng Zhen has been received. The ditch along the East Riverbank was originally a river in the city's river and lake system, called the Yu River; due to years of disrepair, it has become a sewage ditch. After the liberation of Beijing in 1949, the government slightly dredged it; however, due to insufficient routine maintenance, some nearby residents often dumped garbage into the river, which gradually became silted up again. The students' suggestion to turn it into an underground culvert and build a road on top is excellent. However, due to the undetermined capital construction plan, it is not yet certain whether the river should maintain its water surface or be converted into an underground culvert; even if it were to be converted into an underground culvert, it cannot be built at present due to limitations in manpower, materials, and basic data (such as the fact that the diameter of the sewer pipe would need to be at least three meters when building the underground culvert, which we are currently unable to produce). To maintain cleanliness, the Bureau of Sanitation Engineering will dredge it and pay attention to routine maintenance; at the same time, we hope that nearby residents will no longer dump garbage and filth into the river. We hope that the students will assist us in carrying out this publicity work.
                                The General Office of the Beijing Municipal People's Government
To the Editorial Department:
    The opinions expressed by Yang Guoshi, Fang Gong, Zhang Ming, and others in the "Letters from Readers" column of the March 11th People's Daily regarding the solution to the city's housing problem are very good, and we are currently compiling and studying them. The housing problem in Beijing is a relatively complex one, and we hope that people from all walks of life will put forward more constructive opinions in the future as a reference and basis for our research into this problem.
                                The General Office of the Beijing Municipal People's Government

　　北京市人民政府重视群众意见       
    答复读者关于改御河为暗管的问题       
    并希望各界人民多提意见帮助政府解决房屋问题编辑同志请转彭市长：
    北京市人民政府对于修建市区道路和疏浚沟渠工作，已经有了很大成绩。市民们都非常感谢！
    东华门东河沿和西河沿间的那条污水沟，每到天热就有臭味。如能把它接上暗管，筑成道路，不仅有益于公共卫生，并且也使交通便利。
    这是一个小小的建议，希望你能采纳。
                             北京大学三院  王明诚等全体学生编辑同志请转北京大学三院王明诚等全体同学：
    你们给彭真市长的信已收到了。东河沿的那条水沟原系城内河湖水系的一条河流，名叫御河；因年久失修，形成了一条污水沟。一九四九年北京解放后，政府曾稍加疏浚；但因平日养护工作做得不够，附近有些居民常向河内倾倒垃圾，又渐形淤塞。同学们建议把它修成暗沟，上筑马路，这是很好的。但因首都建设计划未定，该河应维持河水水面或修成暗沟，目前还不能肯定；即使要修成暗沟，也因人力、物力及基本资料的限制（如修暗沟时，下水道直径至少需三公尺，现当无力制作），目前亦不能修建。为了保持清洁，卫生工程局将加以疏浚并经常注意养护；同时希望附近居民不要再向河内倾倒垃圾秽物。希望同学们协助我们进行这一宣传工作。
                                北京市人民政府秘书厅编辑同志：
    三月十一日人民日报“读者来信”栏所载杨国栻、方工、章明等对解决本市房屋问题的意见是很好的，我们现在正汇总研究。北京市的房屋问题是一个比较复杂的问题，希望各界人民今后能提出更多积极性的意见，作为我们研究这一问题的参考和依据。
