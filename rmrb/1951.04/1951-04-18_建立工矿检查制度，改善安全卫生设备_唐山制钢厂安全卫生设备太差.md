Establish a Labor Inspection System, Improve Safety and Sanitary Equipment
Tangshan Steel Plant's Safety and Sanitary Equipment is Too Poor

To the Editor:

Since liberation, the Tangshan Steel Plant has made significant progress in production and improved employee benefits, such as building more housing and bathhouses, expanding the cafeteria, barbershop, and clinic. However, a closer look at the plant's safety and sanitary equipment reveals many problems that urgently need addressing. In the main production processes, such as smelting, casting, and reheating workshops, poor ventilation prevents the discharge of large amounts of high-temperature gases. The casting department's skylights can only be opened halfway, and the steelmaking department's converter chimneys are too small, causing the workshops to be filled with carbon monoxide, soot, and smelly oil fumes day and night. This situation seriously damages the workers' health. A steelmaking worker named Tian Wanli died from carbon monoxide poisoning due to excessive inhalation. According to statistics from March of this year, workers at the plant suffering from lung infiltration, bronchitis, and other respiratory ailments accounted for 44% of all illnesses in the plant.

In the casting department, the electric furnace and ingot casting pit are too close together, exposing workers to high heat radiation, causing them to feel dizzy and lightheaded. Last summer, workers at the electric furnace and ingot casting pit had to drink heat-relieving medicine every day.

In the steelmaking and casting workshops, finished products, semi-finished products, and waste slag are piled all over the floor. Crane routes and pedestrian walkways are not clearly marked, making accidents likely during busy periods. In February, 81 people were injured in the plant due to collisions, accounting for 58% of all injuries that month.

There are too few toilets in each workshop. The casting department, with 250 workers, has no toilet. The steelmaking department's toilet is too far from the work area, causing workers to waste time going back and forth. Changing rooms are generally lacking in all workshops, and workers change clothes in the workshops. There are also not enough clothing boxes in the workshops, so workers pile their clothes, shoes, and food together, which is unsanitary. There is also no food heating equipment in the workshops, so workers can only heat the meals they bring on charcoal stoves, hot bricks, or hot steel heads. Each workshop lacks fixed drinking water facilities. The water consumed by the plant is drawn from small rivers in the suburbs and filtered inadequately. According to doctors' examinations, the water contains many intestinal bacteria. Many workers suffer from gastrointestinal diseases due to inadequate food and lack of hot water.

In terms of labor protection, the plant has also failed to provide workers with various tools according to their job requirements. For example, workers grinding lime work in rooms filled with flying lime dust, but the plant does not provide them with goggles.

Steelmaking and stoker workers often get burns on the back of their hands because their gloves are too short. Workers in the electric furnace charging group of the casting department have no work clothes, and their own clothes are often ruined by the heat during charging.

Because the plant's safety and sanitation work is so poor, the average monthly number of sick people in January and February accounted for 41% of the plant's total workforce.

We hope that the Tangshan Steel Plant will conduct an inspection of issues related to worker safety and sanitation and earnestly resolve them.

### 建立工矿检查制度，改善安全卫生设备  唐山制钢厂安全卫生设备太差

　　建立工矿检查制度，改善安全卫生设备
    唐山制钢厂安全卫生设备太差编辑同志：
    唐山制钢厂解放以后，生产成绩显著提高，职工福利也有若干改进，如增盖工房、浴室，扩大食堂，理发室和医务所等。但若详细看看该厂的安全和卫生设备，还有很多问题亟需解决。该厂主要的生产过程如熔炼、铸造、再热等车间，因通风不良，大量高温气体不能排出。铸造部的天窗只能开半扇门，炼钢部转炉烟囱过小，车间昼夜弥漫着一氧化炭、煤烟和臭油烟等。这种情况严重地损害着工人的健康。炼钢部工人田万利曾因呼吸一氧化炭过多，中毒身死。根据今年三月份的统计，该厂工人患肺浸润和支气管炎等呼吸系统病症的，占全厂疾病人数的百分之四十四。
    铸造部的电炉和造块池相距太近，工人受到高热的轴射，经常被烤得头晕眼花。去年夏天，电炉和造块池的工人每天要喝消热药水。
    在炼钢、铸造两个车间，成品、半成品及废渣堆得满地都是，天车路线及人行道界线不清，工作紧张时很容易出事故，二月份全厂因此被撞伤的有八十一人，占该月全厂受伤人数百分之五十八。
    各车间厕所很少，铸造部有二百五十人工作，却没有一个厕所。炼钢部的厕所离工作现场太远，工人往返很误时间。各车间普遍缺少更衣室，工人就在车间脱换衣服。车间又无足够的盛衣箱，工人把衣服、鞋和食物堆在一起，很不卫生。车间内也无食物加热设备，工人带来的饭，只能在炭炉、热砖及热钢头上烤热。各车间缺乏固定的饮水设备，该厂所吃的水，是自市郊小河里弄来的，过滤也很简陋。据医生检查，水内含有很多肠菌。工人因吃不好饭，没有足够的开水喝，患肠胃病的很多。
    在劳动保护方面，该厂也未能根据工作需要，发给工人各种用具。如磨石灰的工人，工作时满屋飞扬着石灰、厂方也不发给工人眼镜。
    炼钢、烧火工人因手套短小，手背经常被烫伤。铸造部电炉装料组工人无工作服，工人自己的衣服在装料时经常被烤坏。
    因为该厂安全卫生工作太差，一、二两月份平均每月生病人数占全厂职工总数的百分之四十一。
    我们希望唐山制钢厂对有关工人安全及卫生的问题，能进行检查，并认真地加以解决。
