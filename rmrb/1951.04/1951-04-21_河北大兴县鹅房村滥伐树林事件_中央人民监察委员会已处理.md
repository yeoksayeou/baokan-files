    Hebei Daxing County Efang Village Illegal Logging Incident
    Central People's Supervisory Committee Has Handled

Editor:

    Regarding the complaint from Ma Wenqi, a resident of Daxing County, Hebei Province, to the Central People's Supervisory Committee about illegal logging in Efang Village of the county, the Central People's Supervisory Committee has now completed its investigation and has taken the following actions:

    Between the spring and summer of 1950, residents of Efang Village, Daxing County, Hebei Province, collectively felled and sold more than 700 trees (divided equally by groups for collective felling and sale) from the publicly owned woodland confiscated during land reform. In addition, landowners who had been allocated land felled approximately 500 trees on the former landlord's land themselves. Zhao Fengchun, the village head of Efang Village and director of the Forest Protection Committee, had agreed to this action by the masses and had neither requested instructions from nor reported it to the higher-level government before or after the event. Zhao Fengchun's behavior in violating policies and lacking organization and discipline should have been punished; however, because Daxing was liberated relatively late, relevant authorities had not yet conducted in-depth publicity on forest protection policies, and because the village head was able to earnestly review his mistakes after criticism and education, it was decided to exempt him from punishment.

    河北大兴县鹅房村滥伐树林事件
    中央人民监察委员会已处理编辑同志：
    河北大兴县居民马文起向中央人民监察委员会控告该县鹅房村滥伐树林一事，中央人民监察委员会现已调查完毕，并作了如下的处理。
    一九五○年春夏之间，河北大兴县鹅房村居民共砍伐土地改革时收归公有的成片树木七百多棵（系按组平分集体砍伐出售）；此外并将地主土地上的树木约五百多棵，由分得土地者自行砍伐。鹅房村村长兼护林委员会主任赵凤春曾同意群众此种行动，而且事前事后均未向上级政府请示、报告。赵凤春此种违反政策与无组织无纪律的行为，本应予以处分；但因大兴解放较晚，有关机关对护林政策还没有进行深入的宣传，而且，该村长在经过批评教育后，尚能认真检讨自己的错误，所以决定免予处分。
