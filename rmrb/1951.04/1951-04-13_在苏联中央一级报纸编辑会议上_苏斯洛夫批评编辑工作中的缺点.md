According to a report in the Soviet newspaper "Culture and Life" on February 21st: The Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union recently held a meeting of editors of central-level newspapers, at which the following issues were discussed: the issue of newspapers publicizing economic knowledge to the people, the handling of letters from workers, and the shortcomings in manuscript editing. Comrade Suslov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, spoke at the meeting.

Suslov said: Many editorial departments of central-level newspapers have neglected many extremely important issues, making the content of the newspapers poor.

As everyone knows, our Party attaches great importance to publicizing economic knowledge among the people, systematically explaining in newspapers the superiority and achievements of the socialist economy, the decline and decay of the capitalist economy, and mobilizing our country's workers to complete current economic tasks. Therefore, our newspapers should systematically publish manuscripts on economic issues—essays, lectures, discussions, reviews of books on economic issues, paying attention both to general theoretical manuscripts and to specific economic issues of enterprises, economic departments, etc.

However, newspapers are still doing a poor job in completing this task. In Izvestia, Labor, Red Star, Komsomolskaya Pravda, and other newspapers, such manuscripts are sometimes published, but articles publicizing economic issues have been rarely published recently.

Our newspapers and magazines have written very little and unvividly about the new great communist construction projects—the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations on the Volga River, the Turkmen Main Canal, the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station on the Dnieper River, the South Ukrainian and North Crimean Canals, and the Volga-Don Canal. The newspapers have not explained the historical significance of these construction projects, nor have they explained the role they play in the further development of our country's productive forces. Newspapers rarely publish manuscripts about these new construction projects, and there is no well-thought-out plan.

Suslov said: One of the serious shortcomings in the work of newspapers and magazines is the lack of due attention to the issue of making the best use of the most abundant new technological equipment and other potential forces in the national economy.

Our socialist national economy has achieved great success in the re-equipment of technical equipment in the post-war years. It has never been equipped with such abundant top-notch technical equipment—machines, machine tools, various equipment. Our socialist industry now has many more machine tools than in 1940, and they are more technically advanced. In 1949 and 1950 alone, in order to meet the needs of the most important sectors of the national economy, our motherland's industry created more than 700 new types and brands of machines and machinery with high productivity.

Our agriculture has the richest technical equipment. In 1949 and 1950 alone, agriculture received more than 330,000 tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower per tractor), 75,000 combine harvesters, 146,000 trucks, and more than 3 million trailers and other agricultural machines.

These figures show that all sectors of our national economy have achieved great success in the further re-equipment of technical equipment. From these figures, the task of fully utilizing new technical equipment in order to move forward more rapidly is of particular significance. The struggle to improve the quality of work in industry, transportation, and agriculture is of particular significance.

At the same time, newspapers rarely publish manuscripts that explain how advanced elements in industry and agriculture use the latest technological achievements to achieve high labor productivity, and how they constantly explore new potential capabilities to increase industrial output, land output, and livestock product productivity. Newspapers rarely report on the socialist competition carried out to better utilize technical equipment, the situation of organizing production learning, and the situation of improving the level of cadre capacity.

It must also be pointed out here that our newspapers and magazines are also weak in publicizing the advanced experience of industry and agriculture. The great power of positive examples is therefore not fully utilized. The newspapers of various central-level departments—"The Whistle," "Construction Materials Industry," "Maritime Shipping," "Inland River Shipping," "Timber Industry," and others, more or less systematically explain the work experience of various advanced elements in industry and transportation, but they do not publish summarizing manuscripts, and rarely describe the work experience of advanced enterprises and production teams that have achieved high indicators in the implementation of plans.

In the "Decision on the Organization of Publicity and Promotion of Scientific Achievements and Advanced Experience in Agriculture," the Central Committee of the CPSU instructed the editorial departments of central-level agricultural newspapers—"Socialist Agriculture," "Soviet Cotton Growing," and "State Farms"—to systematically report the work experience of advanced agricultural workers, the best collective farms, agricultural machinery stations, and state farms, as well as the experience of agricultural leadership work. These newspapers have recently begun to publish more frequently articles and communications introducing the working methods of advanced agricultural workers and scientific achievements, as well as articles by scientists to help students of three-year agricultural-animal husbandry schools. However, the level of publicity of advanced experience in newspapers cannot yet meet the growing needs. The quality of manuscripts is far from often meeting the requirements of readers. The articles and communications published in newspapers often only tell readers about the results achieved by advanced elements, but do not deeply explain their working methods, and do not give scientific summaries of experience.

Many manuscripts on advanced experience are not in-depth and are only of a notification nature because: the work of absorbing scientific workers and agricultural experts to participate in this work is still done poorly, and the work of preparing manuscripts describing advanced experience is often handed over to workers who lack experience in agricultural issues.

Suslov then elaborated on the serious shortcomings of the Izvestia editorial department in handling letters from workers.

The Central Committee of the CPSU has considered this issue. In its decision, the Central Committee of the CPSU pointed out: The Izvestia editorial department has formed a bad practice in handling letters from workers. Letters are rarely published in the newspaper, and are usually mechanically transferred to various organizations and agencies, delayed for a long time without a reply, and the replies to the letters are often indifferent and routine. No one in the editorial department studies the letters received, so it cannot become an important source for the editorial department to discover new themes and new issues raised by workers in their letters. Due to the careless and casual attitude taken in handling letters, the careless staff of the editorial department do not study the letters sent to Izvestia from the essence, but transfer them to the editorial departments of other newspapers.

The editorial board and editor-in-chief of Izvestia, Comrade Gubin, did not pay serious attention to the work of handling letters from workers. They neglected that the work of handling letters is the most important thing for all editors, and neglected that if the letters from workers are not handled seriously and systematically, the newspaper cannot successfully carry out its tasks.

The Central Committee of the CPSU suggested that Comrade Gubin, Editor-in-Chief of Izvestia, take measures to improve the work of handling letters from workers, to enrich the newspaper's communications liaison department with experienced and dedicated business staff, to implement a strict registration system for letters from workers received by the newspaper, and to strengthen supervision over the correct use of letters.

It should be said that the editorial departments of other central-level newspapers also have many serious shortcomings in handling letters from workers. Therefore, all newspapers should draw the necessary conclusions from the decision of the Central Committee of the CPSU on the serious shortcomings existing in Izvestia in handling letters from workers.

Suslov finally pointed out some other shortcomings and errors that many central-level newspapers have indulged in recently.

The Literary Gazette editorial organization published several manuscripts without the necessary prior review, which led to the occurrence of bad practices in its work that have nothing in common with the Bolshevik newspapers. By not listening to the justified opinions of many people who opposed these manuscripts after publishing erroneous manuscripts, and at the same time not correcting the errors it had indulged in, the newspaper's editorial department made its serious errors even more serious.

The editorial departments of several central-level newspapers, especially Komsomolskaya Pravda, Red Star, and Soviet Art News, are negligent in the editing of manuscripts. As a result, those poorly made and poorly written manuscripts have occupied the pages of the newspaper.

### 在苏联中央一级报纸编辑会议上  苏斯洛夫批评编辑工作中的缺点

　　在苏联中央一级报纸编辑会议上
    苏斯洛夫批评编辑工作中的缺点
    据苏联《文化与生活》报二月二十一日载称：最近几天苏联共产党中央宣传鼓动部举行了中央一级报纸编辑会议，会上讨论了下列问题：报纸对人民宣传经济知识的问题，劳动者来信的处理问题，稿件编辑工作的缺点问题。联共中央委员会书记苏斯洛夫同志曾在会上发言。
    苏斯洛夫说：有许多中央一级报纸的编辑部忽略了许多极重要的问题，使报纸的内容贫乏。
    大家知道，我们党多么重视在人民当中宣传经济知识，在报纸上有系统地说明社会主义经济的优越性及成就、资本主义经济的衰颓及腐朽，动员我国劳动者完成当前经济任务这几项工作。因此，我们的报纸应当有系统地刊载经济问题的稿件——论文、讲演、商榷性的文章、对经济问题书籍的评论，既注意到一般性理论的稿件，也注意到企业、经济部门等等的具体经济问题的稿件。
    但是，报纸在完成这个任务上仍然做得不好。在消息报、劳动报、红星报、共青真理报和别的报纸上，有时载有这类稿件，可是宣传经济问题的文章近来却几乎没有刊载了。
    我们的报章杂志对新的伟大的共产主义建设工程——伏尔加河上的古比雪夫及斯大林格勒水电站、土库曼大运河，第聂伯河上的卡霍夫卡水电站，南乌克兰及北克里米亚运河、伏尔加河——顿河运河——写得很少而且不生动。报纸没有说明这些建设工程的历史意义，没有说明它们对于进一步发展我国生产力的事业所起的作用。报纸极少刊载关于这些新建设工程的稿件，而且也没有考虑周密的计划。
    苏斯洛夫说：报章杂志工作中严重的缺点之一，就是对最好地利用最丰富的新技术装备及国民经济中其他潜在力量的问题缺乏应有的注意。
    我们的社会主义国民经济在战后几年在技术设备的再装备上获得了巨大的成就。它从来没有以这样丰富的头等技术装备——机器、工作母机、各种设备——装置起来。我们的社会主义工业现在拥有的工作母机比一九四○年多了很多，而且在技术上是更加完善了。仅在一九四九年及一九五○年，为了满足最重要的国民经济部门的需要，我们祖国的工业便创造了七百多种有高度生产力的新型式和新牌子的机器与机械。
    我们的农业有最丰富的技术装备。仅在一九四九年及一九五○年，农业就得到了三十三万余架拖拉机（按每架十五匹马力计算）、七万五千架联合机、十四万六千辆载货汽车和三百多万辆拖车及其他农业机器。
    这些数字说明了我国国民经济的一切部门，已在技术设备的进一步再装备上获得了巨大的成就。从这些数字看来，为更加迅速地向前迈进而充分利用新的技术装备的任务，就具有特别重大的意义。为提高工业、运输业及农业工作的质量而进行的斗争就具有特别重大的意义。
    同时报纸却极少刊载下述的稿件，即：说明工业和农业中先进分子怎样利用最新的技术成就来达到高度的劳动生产率，怎样经常探求新的潜在能力以提高工业的产量、田地的出产量和牲畜产物的生产率。报纸很少报道为更好地利用技术装备而展开社会主义竞赛的情形、组织生产学习的情形和提高干部能力水平的情况。
    这里还必须指出我们的报章杂志在宣传工业与农业的先进经验上也是软弱无力的。积极性的范例的伟大力量因此就没有被充分利用。中央一级各部门的报纸——《汽笛》、《建筑材料工业》、《海上航运》、《内河航运》、《木材业》及其他等等，都或多或少地有系统地说明了工业与运输业中各个先进分子的工作经验，可是却没有刊载总结性的稿件，很少叙述在执行计划中达到高度指数的先进的企业及生产组的工作经验。
    联共中央在“关于宣传及推广农业方面的科学成就及先进经验的组织工作”的决定中，责成中央一级农业报纸——《社会主义农业》、《苏联植棉业》及《国营农场》报——的编辑部，有系统地报道农业先进分子、最好的集体农场、农业机器站和国营农场的工作经验，以及农业领导工作的经验。这些报纸近来已开始较为经常地刊载介绍农业先进分子的工作方法及科学成就的文章和通讯，以及科学家为了帮助三年制农业——畜牧学校学生的文章了。可是，报纸上先进经验的宣传水平还不能满足日益增大的需要。稿件的质量远非经常都可以满足读者的要求。报纸上所刊载的文章和通讯，时常只把先进分子所达到的成果告诉读者，而不深入地解说他们的工作方法，不给经验以科学的总结。
    许多关于先进经验的稿件之所以不深入、所以仅是通知的性质，是因为：在吸收科学工作者、农业专家参加这项工作上还作得很差，而且时常把叙述先进经验的稿件的准备工作交给在农业问题上缺乏经验的工作者去做。
    苏斯洛夫接着详述了消息报编辑部在处理劳动者来信上的严重缺点。
    联共中央已考虑了这个问题。联共中央在决定中指出：消息报编辑部已在处理劳动者来信上形成了恶劣的作法，来信很少在报纸上刊载出来，而通常是被机械地转交给各个组织与机关，长久拖延不给答复，而且对来信的答复也时常是淡漠的、例行公事的。编辑部收到的信件谁都不去研究，因此它就不能成为编辑部发现劳动者在来信中提出的新题材新问题的重要来源。由于在处理来信上采取粗心大意和随随便便的态度，编辑部各个漫不经心的工作人员便不从本质上研究劳动者寄到消息报的信件，而把它们转交给其他报纸的编辑部。
    消息报的编辑委员会及总编辑顾滨同志对处理劳动者来信的工作没有予以严重的注意，他们忽略了处理来信的工作是全体编辑最重要的事情，而且忽略了如果不认真地、有系统地处理劳动者的来信，报纸就不能胜利地执行它的任务。
    联共中央建议消息报总编辑顾滨同志采取措施改进处理劳动者来信的工作，以经过考查的专心业务的工作人员充实报纸的通讯联络部，对报纸所收到的劳动者来信，实行严格的登记制度，加强对正确使用信件的监督。
    应该说，其他中央一级报纸的编辑部在处理劳动者来信上也有不少严重的缺点。因此，所有的报纸都应从联共中央关于消息报在处理劳动者来信上所存在的严重缺点的决定中，得出应有的结论。
    苏斯洛夫最后指出许多中央一级报纸在最近这个时期所纵容的若干其他缺点与错误。
    文学报编辑机构未经必须的事前审查便把若干稿件发表了，这就在它的工作上发生了与布尔什维克报纸毫无共同之处的恶劣的作法。由于发表了有错误的稿件之后还不倾听许多反对这些稿件的正当意见，同时又不纠正它所纵容的错误，该报编辑部就使它的严重错误更加严重了。
    若干中央一级报纸，特别是共青真理报、红星报和苏联艺术报等的编辑部，漫不经心地对待稿件的编辑工作。结果，那些粗制滥造和编写得不好的稿件就侵占了报纸的篇幅。
          ×    ×      ×
    苏斯洛夫建议各报的编辑委员会和编辑讨论这次会议的成果，并采取必要的措施以消除报纸编辑工作中存在的缺点。
