[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Mayor Peng Zhen Replies to Muslims
    Encouraging Continued Efforts to Eradicate Counter-Revolutionary Remnants
    All Male and Female Students of the Southern City Monks and Nuns Study Class Write to Mayor Peng Zhen Guaranteeing Participation in the Patriotic Movement
    [Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch] Imams, elders, and principals of twenty-four Muslim primary schools from thirty-four mosques in Beijing wrote to Mayor Peng Zhen on March 31st, expressing their determination to support the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Mayor Peng Zhen replied, encouraging them to continue their efforts, unite the Muslim people, and eradicate counter-revolutionary remnants. The full text of Mayor Peng Zhen's reply is as follows: "I have received your letter. It is very good that you held a meeting to discuss assisting the government in suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, and I welcome your help with the utmost enthusiasm. I hope you will continue your efforts, conduct in-depth propaganda, unite the Muslim people, and eradicate counter-revolutionary remnants. This is a powerful guarantee for consolidating the people's democratic government and national unity." (Cheng Run)
    [Our Newspaper] The fifty-nine male and female students of the Southern City Monks and Nuns Study Class in Beijing, in order to strengthen the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea within the Buddhist and Taoist communities and to further assist the government in carrying out the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, held a meeting on the 9th and decided to carry out propaganda work in the Southern City District.
    At the meeting, they wrote a letter to Mayor Peng Zhen, saying: "We are a group of monks and nuns. Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionary government did not treat us as human beings, and we suffered all kinds of oppression and humiliation. After liberation, the People's Government led us to study, took care of us, and cherished us, making us realize that we are also masters of the new China and educating us to love our great motherland. We deeply feel that we are indeed liberated, and we have truly stood up! It is hateful that the American devils and the Kuomintang special agents and bandits are lurking everywhere, spreading rumors, sabotaging, and harming the people. In order to consolidate our victory and enable the Chinese people to live a good life in peace, we fully support the 'Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries' promulgated by the Central People's Government. We guarantee: (1) To strengthen our studies, raise our awareness, and earnestly eliminate the 'otherworldly' thinking created by the reactionaries. (2) To be responsible for propaganda, so that all monks and nuns in the Southern City will recognize the crimes of the American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and actively participate in the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea. (3) To thoroughly expose the counter-revolutionary elements lurking within our Buddhist community, without slackening or being careless. (4) The reactionary secret societies and Taoist sects, especially the Yiguandao and Jiugongdao, are grassroots organizations of the reactionaries and also our mortal enemies in Buddhism. We resolutely assist the government in thoroughly eradicating them."

    【京市新闻处讯】北京市三十四座清真寺的阿訇、乡老和二十四处回民小学校长，于三月三十一日写信给彭真市长，表示他们拥护镇压反革命的决心。彭真市长回信鼓励他们，继续努力，团结回民，肃清反革命残余。彭真市长的回信全文如下：“收到你们写来的信，你们开会讨论协助政府镇压反革命活动，这是很好的，我以极高的热诚欢迎你们的帮助。并望继续努力，深入宣传，团结回民，肃清反革命残余。这乃是巩固人民民主政权和民族团结的有力的保障。”（程润）
    【本报讯】北京市南城僧尼学习班全体男女学员五十九名，为了在僧尼内部加强抗美援朝的爱国运动和进一步协助政府进行镇压反革命工作，于九日集会，决定在南城分区进行宣传工作。
    他们在会上写信给彭真市长，信中说：“我们是一群出家人，解放前蒋介石反动政府不把我们当人看待，我们受尽了压迫和侮辱。解放后人民政府领导我们学习，照顾我们，爱护我们，使我们认识到我们也是新中国的主人，教育我们爱护我们伟大的祖国。我们深深感觉到我们的确是解放了，我们真的是翻身站起来了！可恨美国鬼子和蒋介石的特务匪徒们到处潜伏、造谣、破坏、残害人民。为了巩固我们的胜利，使中国人民能安心地过好日子，我们完全拥护中央人民政府所颁布的《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》。我们保证：（一）加强学习，提高认识，认真地清除由反动派给我们造成的“超世”思想。（二）负责宣传，使南城所有的僧尼都认识到美蒋匪帮的罪恶，积极地参加抗美援朝的爱国运动。（三）彻底检举潜伏在我们佛教内部的反革命分子，不松懈，不麻痹。（四）反动派的会门和道门，尤其是一贯道和九宫道，他们是反动派的基层组织，也是我们佛教的死敌，我们坚决地协助政府，彻底地把他们肃清。”
