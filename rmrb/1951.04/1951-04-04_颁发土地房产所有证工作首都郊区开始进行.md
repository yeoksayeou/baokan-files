The work of issuing land and property ownership certificates and surveying land has recently begun in a planned manner in the capital's suburbs. This is a major event that suburban farmers have long yearned for. Although land reform in the capital's suburbs was completed as early as last spring, the land deeds, due to successive changes, replacements, and corruption by reactionary government officials, have resulted in serious "discrepancies between land deeds," "inaccurate acreage," and even unreasonable phenomena such as so-called "eight being reported as ten" or "two being reported as one," which has affected the fairness and rationality of agricultural tax burdens. Therefore, the capital's suburbs are being extremely cautious in carrying out the issuance of land certificates and land surveying. The steps are: (1) mobilizing the masses to clear and measure the land; (2) mediating property disputes among the masses; (3) training and organizing a group of personnel to handle certificate filling, registration, statistics, and administrative matters; and (4) after sufficient publicity and explanation, collecting certificate fees from farmers. The municipal, district, and village-level people's governments, together with mass organizations such as farmers' associations at all levels, have organized certificate issuing committees to lead the issuance work. The Municipal Certificate Issuing Committee is composed of the Land Administration Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the Public and Enemy Property Management Bureau, the Civil Affairs Bureau, the People's Court, and the Suburban Farmers' Association, with the Director of the Suburban Work Committee and the Directors of the Finance and Land Administration Bureaus serving as the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the committee, respectively. The committee has established seven inspection teams to inspect work in various districts. The village certificate issuing committee consists of seven to nine members, depending on the size of the village, and is divided into three groups: review, land measurement, and certificate issuance. The entire work is divided into three stages: the first step is to focus on training cadres, combining publicity and mobilization with typical experiments; the second step is registration, deed collection, review, verification, and land measurement; and the third step is certificate filling, issuance, fee collection, statistics, and summary. However, the three stages are carried out in an interwoven manner, taking into account the work situation, with land measurement being the most complex and arduous task. In addition to the unreasonable phenomena that have historically existed in land area, the situation of concealing land is still quite serious. For example, last year, 14,500 mu of unregistered land was discovered in the 15th district. Last autumn, 2,070 mu of unregistered land were discovered in Madian Village in the 14th district, accounting for approximately 41.4% of the originally reported land. Only by carrying out universal land measurement and then issuing certificates can we achieve "matching land deeds and certificates," accurately guarantee people's property rights, and encourage farmers' enthusiasm for production. To do this work well, the masses must master land measurement techniques. The land measurement methods issued in Beijing stipulate that land measurement must mobilize the masses and rely on the masses, so that land measurement becomes the masses' own business, and that administrative villages be used as the units to organize several land measurement teams. Under the leadership of the certificate issuing committee, a responsibility system is implemented, with land measured in sections. Each group designates one person to count, and after the measurement is completed each day, the groups gather to calculate together to avoid delays caused by calculating while measuring. Once the land measurement is completed, the work of filling out and issuing certificates is immediately carried out. To minimize errors in certificate filling, the Municipal Certificate Issuing Committee has also formulated the "Land and Property Ownership Certificate Filling Methods" and a certificate issuance manual. Before the Spring Festival, municipal and district-level cadres were concentrated for study, and after the Spring Festival, symposiums were held with village cadres and filling personnel at the district level to discuss and study in detail and learn the filling methods. It is also stipulated that drafts should be made when filling out certificates, sent to the district for review, and then formally filled out on the ownership certificates. In addition, each district has also launched publicity work based on the State Council's decision on land certificate fee collection, combined with education on current events of resisting America and aiding Korea, to enable farmers to understand the principles of certificate issuance and fee collection, so that the work of certificate issuance and fee collection can be successfully completed.

　　颁发土地房产所有证工作       
    首都郊区开始进行
    颁发土地房产所有证和丈量土地工作，最近已在首都郊区有计划地开始进行。这是郊区农民久已渴望的一件大事。首都郊区的土地改革虽早于去年春即全部完成，但由于土地经过历代的换契、补契、以及反动政府官吏徇私舞弊，形成严重的“地契不符”、“亩数不确”，甚至有所谓“八顶十”、“二顶一”等不合理现象，以致影响农业税负担的公平合理。为此首都郊区在进行颁发土地证和丈量土地工作时，极为慎重。其步骤是：（一）发动群众清丈土地；（二）调处群众间地产纠纷；（三）训练和组织一批办理填证、造册、统计、事务的人员；（四）经过充分的宣传解释，向农民收取证费。市、区、村各级人民政府并会同各级农会等群众团体组织了发证委员会，领导进行发证工作。市发证委员会由地政局、财政局、公逆产清管局、民政局、人民法院及郊区农民协会等部门组成，由郊区工作委员会主任及财政、地政两局局长分别担任正副主任委员，委员会下设七个检查组分赴各区检查工作。村发证委员会则视村的大小由委员七人至九人组成，分设审查、丈地、发证三组。且将全部工作分为三个阶段：第一步集中训练干部，宣传动员结合典型试验；第二步登记、收契、审查、核定、丈地；第三步填证、发证、收费、统计、总结。但三个阶段是参酌工作情况，交错进行，而其中以丈地工作为最复杂最繁重，因土地面积除历史上存在的不合理现象外，目前瞒地的情形还相当严重。如去年十五区查出黑地一万四千五百亩。十四区马甸村去秋查出黑地二千零七十亩，约为原报地的百分之四十一点四。经过普遍丈地，然后发证才能达到“地证相符”，确切保障人民产权，鼓励农民生产情绪。而做好这一工作则需使群众掌握丈地的技术。在北京市颁发的丈地办法中规定，丈地必须发动群众，依靠群众，使丈地成为群众自己的事，并以行政村为单位，组织若干丈地小组。在发证委员会领导下，实行专责制，分段丈量。每个小组确定一人计码，每日丈完后，各组集合统一计算，免得随丈随算耽误时间。土地一经丈量完毕，立即进行填证、发证工作。为使填证尽量少错或不错，市发证委员会还制订了《土地房产所有证填写办法》和发证手册，在春节前集中市、区级干部进行学习，春节后接着以区为单位召开村干部及填写人员座谈会，详细讨论研究，学会填写办法。并规定填证时先打草稿，送区审核后再往所有证上正式填写。此外各区并已根据政务院关于土地证收费工作的决定，结合抗美援朝时事教育展开宣传工作，使农民了解发证收费的道理，使发证收费工作能顺利完成。
