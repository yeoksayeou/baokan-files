　　Zhengzhou Private Huachang Construction Factory Foremen Cruelly Exploited Workers; Zhengzhou People's Court Handled the Case According to Law

　　The manager and foremen of the Zhengzhou private Huachang Construction Factory carried out super-economic exploitation of workers and were in arrears with workers' wages for a long time, causing a worker demonstration. The Zhengzhou People's Court has handled the case according to law. Dong Shichang, the manager of Huachang Construction Factory, rented the business license to contractor Feng Ruiting in September 1950 for 100 bags of flour. Feng contracted a batch of projects for the Zhengzhou office of the Quartermaster Department of the Central South Military Region (contracting labor but not materials), with a total price of 111.204 million yuan. On September 14, Feng Ruiting received 100.504 million yuan in project funds, accounting for more than 95% of the total price. Feng then recruited 97 carpenters, masons, and painters, agreeing to pay wages every half month. However, after starting work on September 16, Feng showed no concern for the workers' lives and failed to fulfill the original agreement. Apart from the first wage being paid as scheduled, all subsequent wages were delayed, with workers' wages being in arrears for as long as 46 days, totaling more than 39.5 million yuan in RMB. The workers had agreed with contractor Feng Ruiting to settle the arrears on November 15, but Feng postponed the payment again at that time, delaying it as many as seven times. Around December 10, the workers could not even afford food. On the 15th, the workers only ate two meals of thin noodles a day, and the workers with families were even more helpless. On the morning of the 16th, carpenters, masons, and some laborers could not find Feng Ruiting, so they went to Huachang Construction Factory to demand their wages. The manager was not present at the time, and the factory's accountant, Hou Wanke, actually came forward to reprimand the workers. The workers could no longer bear it and a demonstration broke out.

　　Before the incident, on December 2 last year, worker Sun Youli told the Zhengzhou Municipal Construction Trade Union that he wanted to stop working, but the Construction Trade Union did not pay attention to this matter. At that time, trade union cadre Li Zuomin persuaded the workers not to stop work and wrote a letter to the workers, asking them to elect representatives to negotiate with contractor Feng Ruiting for the payment of wages, but it had no effect. On the 11th, the workers went to the trade union to discuss the matter again, and trade union cadre Meng Jianguang only wrote another letter to the workers, but the problem still could not be solved. On the 15th, after the workers' food expenses were exhausted, Sun Youli went to the trade union again, asking the trade union to take charge and demand the arrears from the contractor. Meng Jianguang only wrote a note to contractor Feng Ruiting, asking Feng to come to the trade union to settle the accounts. The workers did not find Feng Ruiting, and the problem still could not be solved. That evening, the workers went to the trade union again, asking for help, but Meng Jianguang neither responded to the workers nor reported to the higher-level trade union. This bureaucratic style of the construction trade union cadres, who did not care about the workers' hardships, caused dissatisfaction among the workers, who all said that the trade union was useless.

　　After the demonstration occurred, the Zhengzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions believed that the workers' actions were wrong and took the four worker representatives who took down the signboard and shouted slogans with the business license, as well as contractor Feng Ruiting and accountant Hou Wanke, to the Public Security Bureau. After the four worker representatives explained the situation, the worker representatives were released that day, and Feng and Hou were taken to the Labor Bureau for processing. Contractor Feng Ruiting emphasized that the reason for not paying wages was that the Quartermaster Department of the Central South Military Region had not paid him the arrears, and said that the wages should be paid by the Quartermaster Department. In fact, Feng owed the workers more than 39.5 million yuan in wages, while the Zhengzhou office of the Quartermaster Department of the Central South Military Region only owed Feng 7 million yuan, and 20% of the project had not yet been completed. Based on the above situation, Feng is obviously a typical feudal foreman, and he is also engaging in illegal business by borrowing a license, carrying out super-economic and cruel exploitation of workers, which is not permitted by law. Therefore, Feng and Hou were sent to the court that night for handling according to law, and the next day the factory manager Dong Shichang was summoned to court and detained together. After being handled by the Zhengzhou People's Court, 18.6598 million yuan in arrears has been recovered. After deducting 715,000 yuan for food expenses during the workers' work stoppage, the remaining 17.9448 million yuan was used to pay off wages, which has been distributed to the workers by the court in conjunction with the trade union. The remaining 21.55396 million yuan in wages, in addition to 16 million yuan to be paid by the shop guarantors Huachang Construction Factory and Ruifeng Xinji before March 1, there is still 5.55396 million yuan in arrears, which the court is continuing to recover from Dong and Feng.

### 郑州私营华昌营造厂把头残酷剥削工人  郑州市人民法院已依法处理

　　郑州私营华昌营造厂把头残酷剥削工人
    郑州市人民法院已依法处理
    郑州市私营华昌营造厂经理及把头对工人进行超经济的剥削，长期拖欠工人工资，引起工人游行示威事件，已经郑州市人民法院依法处理。华昌营造厂经理董世昌于一九五○年九月间，将营业牌照以一百袋面粉的代价，租借给包工头冯瑞亭，承包中南军区军需部驻郑州办事处工程一批（包工不包料），总价是一亿一千二百零四万元。九月十四日冯瑞亭领工款一亿零五百零四万元，占总价的百分之九十五强。冯即招雇木、泥、油工共九十七人，约定半月发薪一次。但九月十六号开工后，冯对工人生活漠不关心，不履行原来双方协议的规定，除第一次工资按规定发放外，余皆推诿不给，拖欠工人工资竟达四十六天，合人民币三千九百五十万余元。工人曾与包工头冯瑞亭商定于十一月十五日清理欠资，届时冯又延期不还。推拖达七次之多。至十二月十号前后，工人连伙食费也供给不上。十五号那天，工人一天只吃了两餐稀面条，有家属的工人更无办法。十六日早晨，木工、泥工和一部分小工找不到冯瑞亭，便到华昌营造厂讨要工资。当时经理不在，该厂会计侯万科竟出面斥责工人。工人忍无可忍，遂爆发了游行示威事件。
    在事件发生以前，去年十二月二日，工人孙有礼曾向郑州市建筑工会说，要停工不作，但建筑工会对这件事并未重视。当时工会干部李作民曾经劝说工人不要停工，并给工人写了一封信，让工人选出代表，向包工头冯瑞亭交涉发放工资，并无任何效果。十一日工人又到工会商量，工会干部孟剑光又只给工人写了一封信，问题仍是不能解决。十五日工人伙食费用尽后，孙有礼又到工会，要求工会作主，向包工头索还欠资。孟剑光又是只给包工头冯瑞亭写了一个条子，要冯到工会算账。工人没有找到冯瑞亭，问题还是不能解决。当天晚上，工人又到工会，要求作主，孟剑光既未答复工人，也不向上级工会反映。建筑工会干部这种不关心工人疾苦的官僚主义作风，引起工人不满，都说工会不顶事。
    游行示威事件发生以后，郑州市总工会当时认为工人这种举动不对，即将摘招牌、拿营业牌照喊口号的四个工人代表及包工头冯瑞亭、会计侯万科带到公安局；经四个工人代表说明情况后，当天即把工人代表释放，将冯、侯二人带劳动局处理。包工头冯瑞亭强调没有发放工资的原因，是中南军区军需部没有发给他欠资，并说应由军需部发放工资。其实冯欠工人工资三千九百五十万余元，而中南军区军需部郑州办事处仅欠冯七百万元，并且还有百分之二十的工程尚未完成。根据以上情况，冯显系一典型的封建把头，并又假借牌照，进行非法营业，向工人进行超经济的残酷剥削，是法律所不许可的。因此，当晚即将冯、侯二人送押法院，依法处理，翌日并将该厂经理董世昌传讯到案，一并扣押。经郑州市人民法院处理后，已追出欠资一千八百六十五万九千八百元，除工人停工期间伙食费七十一万五千元外，其余一千七百九十四万四千八百元清偿工资，已由法院会同工会分发给工人。下欠之工资二千一百五十五万三千九百六十元，除由铺保华昌营造厂和瑞丰新记于三月一日前清偿一千六百万元外，尚欠五百五十五万三千九百六十元，正由法院继续向董、冯二人追要中。
