　　Fighting for the Peace Demanded by All Working People
    Soviet Workers Greet May Day with New Production Achievements
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 16th] Soviet workers are greeting May Day with new production achievements. According to TASS: Moscow workers are enthusiastically launching the Stakhanovite movement of peaceful work shifts. Many factories have hung huge banners with slogans such as "We want to safeguard the cause of peace" and "We are fighting for the peace demanded by all working people." Kuzmin, a famous turner at the "Red Proletarian" machine tool factory and a Stalin Prize winner, turned three large parts in an eight-hour shift, saving 43 hours compared to the original standard, and won the Red Banner of socialist competition. He said, "I guarantee to increase output fourfold in the peace work shift commemorating May Day as a contribution to the cause of peace." Domaev, a worker at the "Hammer and Sickle" factory, produced two furnaces of steel in one shift, three and a half hours faster than the original standard. Since April 1st, the Stakhanovite workers of the factory have melted 30 furnaces of steel using accelerated methods, producing dozens of tons of metal more than planned. In factories accepting orders for communist construction projects, many Stakhanovite workers have peace flags decorated with white doves on their workbenches. The Stalin Automobile Factory and the Moscow Pump Factory have respectively produced a large number of trucks and efficient dredgers ahead of schedule for the Turkmen Main Canal and the Volga-Don Canal. Workers at the Sherbakov Silk Weaving Factory have also widely applied new methods of accelerated production, allowing spindles to rotate more than 180 times per minute. This new method will enable them to produce more than 100,000 meters of silk fabric above the plan in one year.
    The labor competition celebrating May Day is unfolding in all factories in Leningrad. Workers in various factories have achieved results in completing orders for communist construction projects ahead of schedule. Steelworkers at the Neva Machine Building Factory have completed the first batch of metal equipment for the turbines of the Tsimlyanskaya Hydroelectric Station 20 days ahead of schedule. The "Economizer" Machine Building Factory is completing the high-efficiency equipment for the turbines of the Volga River hydroelectric station ahead of schedule. One machine has been made and is waiting to be shipped, and another will be completed five days early. Kardashov, an assembly worker at the factory who recently won the Stalin Prize, guaranteed to produce a new automatic machine tool before May Day, which will speed up the manufacture of highly precise instruments several times.

　　为一切劳动人民所要求的和平而斗争
    苏联工人以生产新成就迎接五一
    【新华社十六日讯】苏联工人正以新的生产成就迎接五一劳动节。据塔斯社讯：莫斯科的工人正热烈展开斯塔哈诺夫式的和平工作班运动。许多工厂的墙壁上都悬挂着“我们要维护和平事业”、“我们正为一切劳动人民所要求的和平而斗争”等巨幅标语。“红色无产者”工作母机制造厂的著名旋工、斯大林奖金得奖人库兹明，在八小时的一班内旋制了三个大零件，较原定标准节省了四十三小时，荣获社会主义竞赛的红旗。他说：“我保证在纪念五一节的和平工作班中把产量提高四倍，作为对和平事业的贡献。”“锤子与镰刀”工厂工人多马凯耶夫在一班内生产了两炉钢，较原定标准快三小时半。该厂的斯塔哈诺夫式工作者自四月一日以来，已用加速的方法熔钢三十炉，超计划多生产了数十吨的金属。在接受共产主义建设工程订货的工厂中，许多斯塔哈诺夫式工作者的工作台上，都排着饰有白鸽的和平旗帜。斯大林汽车工厂和莫斯科抽水机工厂，已分别为土库曼大运河和伏尔加河——顿河运河提前生产了大批的卡车和效率强大的挖泥机。谢尔巴科夫丝织工厂的工人也广泛应用了加速生产的新方法，使纱锭每分钟旋转一百八十多次。这种新方法将使他们在一年内超计划生产十万公尺以上的丝织品。
    庆祝五一节的劳动竞赛正在列宁格勒的所有工厂中展开着。各厂工人在提前完成共产主义建设工程的订货上已获成绩。涅瓦机器制造厂的钢铁工人已提前二十天完成了齐姆良斯卡雅水电站透平的第一批金属器材。“节约者”机器制造厂正在提前完成伏尔加河上的水电站透平的高效率设备，一架制好的机器正待启运，另一架将提早五天完成。最近荣获斯大林奖金的该厂装配工人卡尔达邵夫，保证在五一节前生产新的自动工作母机，使制造高度精确器具的速度加快好几倍。
