　　We Will Be Happy to Execute These Counter-revolutionaries
    ——A Record of the Gao Bei Dian Farmers' Meeting in the Eastern Suburbs of Beijing to Accuse Counter-revolutionary Elements
    Ding Zi
    On the morning of April 23rd, over ten thousand farmers from Gao Bei Dian Village in the eastern suburbs of Beijing held a meeting to accuse the counter-revolutionary elements Song Xiguang, Fang Deyuan, Zhou Shangde, and Zhang Changlian of their crimes.

    As these counter-revolutionary elements were escorted onto the meeting grounds, the crowd immediately erupted. Zhang Yufang, whose family had been ruined by the local tyrant and landlord Song Xiguang, rushed to the accusation platform and cried out, “In 1946, my father-in-law was paving the millstone path, and Song Xiguang said we had dug up the official road. He had him arrested and hung up to beat him, knocking out three of his front teeth. My father-in-law died after returning home. My older sister was beaten black and blue because she didn’t cancel her household registration when she returned to her husband’s family. My mother-in-law fell ill upon seeing this and died a few days later. My husband was conscripted by him and later beaten to death by him.” Zhang Yufang cried as she accused him, and the crowd below shouted in unison, “A life for a life!” “Shoot Song Xiguang!” Zhang Yufang pointed at Song Xiguang and stomped her feet, saying, “Shooting you would be too easy! Even cutting you to pieces wouldn't be enough to vent my hatred!” Song Xiguang used to be the puppet Baochang and puppet Xiangzhang in the Gao Bei Dian area. He committed the crimes of selling out the country and harming the people with the pistol and radio provided to him by the Japanese invaders. In 1943, he used his gun to scare Liu Yuhai to death, beat Wang Shiming's uncle to death, and forced Li Chongwen's family to become displaced. He forcibly conscripted laborers, leaving Hou Zhangshi and Liu Wangshi to starve and become widows with their children. The number of people who were beaten by him for no reason is countless.

    Fang Deyuan was also a local tyrant and landlord who served as a puppet Baochang and puppet Self-Defense Captain. Old Mrs. Chen accused him, saying, “In 1945, he beat my eldest son, Chen Fuhe, to death and wanted to kill our whole family. If it weren’t for the arrival of the People’s Liberation Army, our family would have all been dead. I wish I could bite him twice.” Fang Deyuan conscripted farmers for the Japanese, puppet, and Chiang Kai-shek regimes. A farmer named Wang Yuan escaped after being captured, but Fang Deyuan shot him. He incited his younger brother, Fang Dexiu, to rape young girls and rob passers-by. After liberation, he continued to spread rumors and undermine the government’s prestige. The masses hated him to the core. At this accusation meeting, more than a dozen people took to the stage to accuse him of his crimes.

    Zhou Shangde, a local tyrant and special agent from Xidian Village, served as a Japanese puppet Baochang and Kuomintang District Committee member. Zhang Shulong accused him, “Zhou Shangde has always opposed the people. He is a Central Unification agent. In 1946, he smashed the ‘Peiping Liberation Three-Day Publication.’ In 1947, he suppressed the patriotic student movement, robbing students of their bicycles, sweaters, and cameras. During the land reform, there were still letters from special agents to him in his home! We cannot let him continue to flaunt his power in our village. We demand that the government execute him.” In addition, Zhou Shangde, on the pretext that Zhou Jialong was a scout for the Eighth Route Army, arrested him and subjected him to severe torture. Zhou Jialong died after returning home. During the Kuomintang reactionary rule, he conscripted laborers, driving Zhang Deli's son insane with fear and causing Shan Deming's mother to die of anger. Many farmers were taken away by him and there is still no news of them. After liberation, he secretly sent his henchman Gao Jun to infiltrate the Farmers' Association and create rumors and stir up trouble. The masses hated this counter-revolutionary element, whose crimes were heinous, to the extreme and unanimously demanded that the government execute him.

    Ma Mashi from Liuli Village accused Zhang Changlian, a leader of Yiguandao. Her face turned pale with anger before she even opened her mouth. She walked angrily in front of Zhang Changlian and pointed at him, saying, "We were forced by you to spend half a month's salary to join Yiguandao. My husband became seriously ill because he had no money to live on, and you pretended to be a sorcerer to 'cure' him to death. My son became ill and died from drinking my breast milk which had been poisoned by anger. Now only my daughter and I are left, without food or drink. It's all your fault. Please tell me, everyone, should he be shot?" The crowd below answered in unison, "He should be shot!" "He should be shot!". In addition, Zhang Changlian forced Wang Huiquan to buy sleeping pills to kill her husband; he also spread rumors that "the Eighth Route Army kills and burns." Wang Huiquan trembled with anger at the thought of this. More than thirty people followed one after another to accuse these counter-revolutionary elements of their crimes. Everyone said: as long as they are shot, we will have nothing more to say.

　　枪毙这些反革命，我们就高兴了
    ——记北京东郊高碑店农民控诉反革命分子大会
    丁紫
    四月二十三日上午，北京市东郊高碑店村一万多农民开会控诉反革命分子宋希广、方德元、周尚德、张长连的罪行。
    当这几个反革命分子被押上会场时，群众立即沸腾起来了。被恶霸地主宋希广害得家破人亡的张玉芳，奔上控诉台控诉道：“一九四六年，我公公垫碾子道，宋希广说我们挖了官道，抓走就吊起来打，打掉了三个门牙，我公公回家后就死了。我姐姐因为回婆家没销户口，被他打得鼻青脸肿。我婆婆一看就病了，没几天也死了，我丈夫被他抓去当壮丁，后来也被他打死了。”张玉芳一边哭着一边控诉，台下群众一片喊声：“杀人偿命！”“枪毙宋希广！”张玉芳指着宋希广跺着脚说：“枪毙了你都便宜，一刀刀剐了你，也解不了我的恨。”宋希广过去是高碑店一带的伪保长、伪乡长。他以日寇配备给他的手枪和电台作卖国祸民的罪恶。一九四三年，他用枪吓死刘玉海，打死王世明的叔叔，逼得李冲文一家人流离失所。他强征壮丁，使侯张氏、刘王氏带着孩子们挨饿守寡。无缘无故遭他毒打的人，更不计其数。
    方德元也是个恶霸地主，当过伪保长，伪自卫队长。陈老太太控诉他说：“一九四五年，他打死我大儿子陈福和，还要杀死我们全家。要不是解放军来了，我们家人都没命了，我恨不得咬他两口。”方德元替日、伪、蒋抓农民当壮丁。有一个叫王元的农民被抓后又逃脱回来，被他枪毙了。他唆使他弟弟方德休强奸幼女，抢劫路人。解放之后，他仍旧造谣言，破坏政府的威信，群众恨透了他。在这次控诉会上，有十几个人上台控诉他的罪行。
    西店村恶霸特务周尚德，当过日伪保长、国民党区分部委员。张树龙控诉他：“周尚德，一直就和人民作对，他是个中统特务。一九四六年他砸过北平解放三日刊。一九四七年，他镇压过学生爱国运动，抢了学生的自行车、毛衣、照像机。土地改革时，他家里还有特务给他的信！我们不能再叫他在我们村里抖威风，要求政府枪毙他。”另外，周尚德借口周家隆是八路军的探子，抓去严刑拷打，周家隆回家就死了。他在国民党反动统治时抓壮丁，吓疯了张德力的儿子，气死山德明的母亲。许多农民被他抓走，到现在没有信息。解放之后，他又密派走狗高峻打入农会，造谣生事。群众对这个罪恶滔天的反革命分子恨到了极点，一致要求政府枪毙他。
    六里屯马马氏控诉一贯道点传师张长连。她还没开口脸就气白了。她气愤愤地走到张长连的面前指着他说：“我们被你强迫，花了半个月薪金入了一贯道。我丈夫因为没钱过生活，急病了，你又装神装鬼把他治死。我儿子吃了我的急火奶，也得病死了。现在就剩我和女儿，没吃没喝，都是你害的，请大家说他该枪毙不该！”台下群众一致回答：“该枪毙！”“该枪毙！”。此外，张长连曾迫使王慧全买安眠药害死她丈夫；还造谣说“八路军杀人放火”。王慧全一想起这事就气得打哆嗦。三十几个人一个跟着一个上台控诉这些反革命分子的罪行。大家都说：只要枪毙了他们，我们就没话说了。
