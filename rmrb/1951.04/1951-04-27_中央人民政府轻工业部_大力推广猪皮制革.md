　　Central People's Government Ministry of Light Industry
    Vigorously Promotes Pigskin Leather Production
    Due to the devastation inflicted by Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops during the war, the number of draught cattle in China's rural areas has greatly decreased compared to pre-war levels. In order to ensure the rapid recovery and increase in agricultural production, governments at all levels have strictly implemented policies to protect draught animals and prohibit the slaughter of draught cattle. This is a very important measure. However, the source of cowhide, a raw material for leather production, has been limited as a result. Recently, leather factories in various places, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing, have been affected in their production due to the lack of cowhide supply. In order to solve this problem, the Central People's Government Ministry of Light Industry is studying the issue with relevant parties and is preparing to utilize pigskin on a large scale for leather production, in order to open up a rich source of leather raw materials for China.
    Leather made from pigskin can be used to replace almost any kind of leather in terms of its uses, and the manufacturing method is also largely the same. The Soviet Union has made extensive use of pigskin, with an annual output of as many as 9 million sheets of pigskin leather before 1935. In the Jiaodong area of Shandong Province, China, pigskin is used for leather production and for making shoes and other items. In Wendeng District alone, the pigskin output in 1950 reached 133,000 sheets. There is even more in Jiaozhou, Laiyang and other regions. In the Northeast, there is now a large-scale leather factory that produces 1,000 sheets of pigskin leather every day. The Tianjin North China Leather Factory, the Beijing Zhenbei Leather Factory, and the Shanghai Industrial Testing Institute of the Central People's Government Ministry of Light Industry are also experimenting with manufacturing.
    The National Leather Conference held last year pointed out that the use of pigskin and other miscellaneous hides for leather production is an important way to solve the current source of leather raw materials in China. After the meeting, the Central People's Government Ministry of Light Industry conducted investigations and research on issues such as pigskin peeling, prices, transportation, and preservation, and found that there were no major difficulties. It also cooperated with the Beijing Tianqiao Slaughterhouse to conduct experiments on peeling pigskin, and achieved good results. It is now planning to peel pigskin in large quantities in Beijing, process it into leather, and supply it for military and civilian use. The Ministry of Light Industry also hopes that the leather industry in major and medium-sized cities across the country can also try to produce pigskin leather, and implement it comprehensively after focusing on promotion, in order to solve the difficulty of cowhide shortage and open up a new development path for China's leather industry.

### 中央人民政府轻工业部  大力推广猪皮制革

　　中央人民政府轻工业部
    大力推广猪皮制革
    我国农村耕牛，由于战争期间遭受日寇与蒋匪军的摧残，数量较战前大为减少。为保证农业的迅速恢复和增产，各地政府均已严格执行保护耕畜，禁宰耕牛的政策。这是十分重要的措施。但制革原料牛皮的来源，因此受到限制。最近各地制革厂如上海、天津、北京等都因牛皮供应的缺乏，而影响生产。中央人民政府轻工业部为解决这一问题，正与有关方面研究，准备大规模利用猪皮制革，以开辟中国皮革原料的富源。
    猪皮制成之革，在用途上几乎可代替任何种皮革，制法亦大同小异。苏联对猪皮曾大量利用，一九三五年前即年产猪革九百万张之多。我国山东省胶东一带，猪皮均用于制革，并自制鞋履等物。其中文登一区，一九五○年猪皮产量即达十三万三千张。胶州、莱阳等区更多。东北现在已有每日制猪革一千张之大规模制革工厂。天津华北制革厂、北京振北制革厂，中央人民政府轻工业部上海工业试验所，亦正在试验制造中。
    去年召开全国制革会议中，曾指出利用猪皮及其他杂皮制革，是解决目前中国皮革原料来源的重要途径。会后中央人民政府轻工业部曾对猪皮剥取、价格、运输、保存等问题，作了调查研究，认为并无重大困难。并曾与北京天桥屠宰场合作，进行剥取猪皮的试验，成绩良好。现正计划在北京大量剥取猪皮，加工制革，以供应军需民用。轻工业部并希望全国各大中城市制革工业，亦能试制猪革，重点推广后全面实行，以解决牛皮缺乏之困难，并为中国制革工业开辟一新的发展途径。
