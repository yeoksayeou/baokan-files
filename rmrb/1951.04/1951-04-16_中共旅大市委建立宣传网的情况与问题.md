　　Situation and Problems of Establishing a Propaganda Network by the CCP Lüda Municipal Committee
    Propaganda Department of the CCP Lüda Municipal Committee
    After the Northeast Bureau Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee convened a conference on enterprise propaganda and mobilization last May, many enterprises and institutions in Lüda, under the leadership of the CCP Lüda Municipal Committee, had initially established a system of propagandists. After the CCP Central Committee's "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the Masses Throughout the Party" was announced in early January this year, the Propaganda Department of the Lüda Municipal Committee immediately instructed its subordinate Party committees at all levels to convey and discuss it within January and February, to study and understand the spirit of the Central Committee's decision, and to examine past propaganda work. In order to earnestly implement the Central Committee's decision, the Lüda Municipal Committee also formulated an implementation plan for establishing a propaganda network for the masses in four months (March-June), and separately convened conferences of propaganda cadres from factories, rural areas, cities, organs, and schools for discussion and research. As of now, most factory branches in the city have studied the Central Committee's decision and have begun to establish or rectify propaganda networks. Street neighborhood branches have universally established propaganda network organizations. In rural areas, establishment is underway with a focus on key areas. A small number of organs and schools have also established propaganda networks and have contacted the district committees, but have not yet carried out propaganda activities. Currently, the city has 4,846 propagandists and 49 municipal-level reporters.
  Criticizing Various Erroneous Understandings
    In the process of establishing the propaganda network, Lüda seriously criticized the following erroneous ideas about propaganda work:
    (1) The idea of opposing propaganda work to production. Some administrative cadres believed that "machines turn the same whether there is propaganda or not," "propaganda work is intangible, completing tasks is tangible; failure to complete production tasks will result in dismissal and investigation, but not doing propaganda work doesn't matter." In response to this idea, we pointed out: We are conducting propaganda to workers, not to machines; only by raising the political consciousness of the workers can we enable the workers who operate the machines to do their work better and improve output and quality. Otherwise, production tasks may not be completed, and administrative cadres may be dismissed and investigated.
    (2) The idea that coercive orders can also complete tasks. This type of argument includes "coercive orders can also complete tasks," "tasks cannot be completed without coercive orders," "coercive orders can be used for war support work," "coercive orders are much simpler than persuasion and education," and so on. Regarding these erroneous ideas, we pointed out: Although coercive orders can complete one or two specific tasks, they will create opposition with the masses and lead to separation from the masses, which will result in our failure. We further analyzed it from a class perspective, explaining that coercive orders are the working methods of the old ruling class, while the main working method of our Party is persuasion and education.
    (3) The idea that Party organizations are unwilling to lead the propaganda network. This idea is more common within branches: they believe that it is better for the trade union to lead the propaganda network, and the Party can lead propaganda work through the trade union. They say, "Why does the Party have to lead directly? The Party committee has so much work to do that it cannot lead the propaganda network." We used the idea that all Party members should "constantly and directly carry out propaganda to the broad masses of the people and further strengthen the connection between the Party and the masses" (People's Daily editorial in Beijing) to educate them, explaining that the Party's propaganda work should become the Party's daily work, and propaganda work is the main method for the Party to lead the masses to guarantee the completion of tasks. Whether the Party's propaganda work to the masses is done well or badly is related not only to the completion of tasks, but more importantly, to the connection between the Party and the masses. Therefore, Party organizations at all levels should seriously lead and organize the propaganda network. We further pointed out that the Party is now an open Party, and Party members and Party policies should directly meet the masses and should carry out Party propaganda activities in the name of the Party.
    (4) The idea that Party members are unwilling to do propaganda work. These people's excuses are: "My work is busy, I don't have time to do it," "My education level is low, I can't do it," "This is the responsibility of propaganda cadres, I don't care," or "The Party Constitution stipulates that Party members should do propaganda work, so there is no need to establish a propaganda network." We pointed out: Any excuse for Party members to refuse to do propaganda work is a violation of the Party Constitution. If Party members do not conduct propaganda to the masses, the political consciousness of the masses will not be raised, and the work of Party members will be even busier. Excusing oneself from doing propaganda work because one's work is busy is essentially an erroneous idea that only coercive orders can complete tasks. Although some Party members have a low level of education, their political consciousness is higher than that of the masses, and they have a clearer understanding of the domestic and international situation and the policies of the Party and the government than the masses, so they can conduct propaganda to the masses (of course, Party members with a low level of education should also actively strive to improve their culture). To some people who believe that since all Party members should do propaganda work, there is no need to participate in the propaganda network, we pointed out: The establishment of a propaganda network is to conduct propaganda work in an organized manner. With the organization of the propaganda network, we can strengthen the training and cultivation of propagandists, so that propagandists can improve their propaganda ability and level.
    In the work of rectifying the propaganda network and developing propagandists, individual branches have adopted the method of electing propagandists at mass meetings, and after the branch has approved the list of propagandists, they have announced the propagandists to the masses without the approval of the higher-level Party organization. In the work of recruiting and cleansing propagandists, individual Party organizations still have excessively high or excessively low requirements for propagandists. All of these have now been corrected.
  Establishing a System of Professional Guidance
    In order to strengthen the leadership of the propaganda network, the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, in addition to regularly understanding the situation of the establishment of propaganda networks and the activities of propagandists in several Party committees and branches, has also established the following specific systems for guiding propaganda network work:
    (1) Issuing propaganda instructions once a month that are combined with current work, and holding business symposiums for propagandists to provide propagandists with materials. (2) The Municipal People's Government Broadcasting Station stipulates the time for propagandists to speak, broadcasting twice on Wednesdays at noon and in the evening. In this broadcast, what propagandists are most willing to listen to is the introduction of experience in propaganda work, especially when propagandists personally narrate their working methods. (3) The Lüda People's Daily opens a special column for the work of propagandists to introduce experience. (4) Holding amateur training classes for branch secretaries to teach why the propaganda network should be established, how to develop propagandists (the conditions and procedures for developing propagandists), how propagandists should carry out their work, and how the branch should lead the propaganda network. Recently, because the branches have been very busy and it is difficult to conduct collective learning in the evenings, it is planned to change to a lecture format in the future, issuing the content of the lectures in advance and lecturing once a week. It is estimated that the branch secretaries in the directly affiliated districts can be trained in rotation in the first half of the year.
  Variety of Propaganda Forms
    Propagandists have used a variety of propaganda forms when conducting propaganda. These include: broadcasting stations, flash bulletins, honor boards, production merit record tables, commendation columns, attendance system tables, blackboards, cartoons, slogans, production express reports, reading broadcasts, mobile red flags for workshop production, family receptions, speech contests, waste product exhibition rooms, production battle tables (i.e., production progress tables), and so on. These propaganda forms are extremely popular with the masses and have played a great role in promoting production. In addition, individual conversations, report meetings, and discussion meetings are commonly used propaganda methods. During the Spring Festival, reporters gave reports combining current affairs, production, and study issues. Street neighborhood propagandists participated in street neighborhood resident meetings and literacy classes, and used the time to "pay New Year visits" and visit door-to-door during the Spring Festival to explain current affairs. In factories, some propagandists used the gaps before and after evening parties and dances to conduct propaganda. In rural areas, the opportunity for cadres to return home for the New Year was generally used to give reports to farmers. According to incomplete statistics from Jin County and Lüshun, a total of 185 report meetings were held during the Spring Festival, with about 50,000 listeners.
  Several Problems to be Solved Urgently
    At present, the following problems still exist in the propaganda network work that need to be solved urgently:
    First, some cadres lack the necessary understanding of propaganda network work and still regard the establishment of the propaganda network as a burden, or believe that daily work and the propaganda network cannot be combined. These comrades do not realize that doing a good job in propaganda network work is a necessary method to ensure the completion of various tasks and is also the key to strengthening the connection between the Party and the masses. The establishment of the propaganda network must be combined with the current work tasks, and only the propaganda network established in combination with various daily tasks (movements) can be a solid propaganda network. If the propaganda network is divorced from various movements, it will not have rich content of activities and must be formalism.
    Second, most of the secretaries and members of the branches are newly promoted cadres with weak leadership abilities; and the establishment of the propaganda network is a new task, and the branches are not good at leading propagandists to carry out propaganda activities, do not know what systems should be established in the branches, and do not understand how to cultivate and educate propagandists. Therefore, in factories, the Party leads reading groups, radio groups, or wall newspaper editorial committees and other organizations through propagandists, and the trade union also leads the above-mentioned organizations through the cultural and educational committees, but the branches are not good at combining the propaganda activities of the Party and the trade union. Therefore, there are times when the Party and the trade union compete for leadership of these propaganda organizations. We have requested the Party committee or general branch to strengthen the leadership ability of the branches. The Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department is also prepared to personally experiment with leading a factory branch, study the various problems in the branch's leadership of the propaganda network work, and accumulate experience for promotion.
    Third, at present, individual propagandists have developed arrogance, complacency, and detachment from the masses. After a propagandist in Zhongshan District attended the Northeast Propagandist Representative Conference, he became arrogant and refused to obey the work assigned by the branch (which is being corrected). Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education for propagandists so that they recognize that propagandists are a bridge between the Party and the masses and must have close ties with the masses. At the same time, it is necessary to cultivate the propagandists' humility, and in production labor and other work, they should set an example and widely unite the activists among the masses to carry out propaganda work together.
    Fourth, some units' propagandists have put forward some propaganda slogans that violate policies or are devoid of ideological content. For example, when the Chuankou Factory was repairing a certain ship, the propagandist put forward a propaganda slogan with a purely economic viewpoint of "completing the ship repair task on a certain day, with a 50% bonus." As a result, the task could not be completed on time, and the workers did not receive the bonus, which affected their morale. A worker in a factory climbed high to carry out repair work. After the work was completed, he did not come down from the ladder but slid down from the rope, violating technical regulations. However, the factory's blackboard newspaper mistakenly praised him as "brave and commendable." In order to avoid propagandists carrying out erroneous or unthoughtful propaganda mobilization, it is necessary to educate propagandists and strengthen the ideological and policy nature of the propaganda content. At the same time, the reporter system should be established quickly. After the Party's leading cadres become reporters, they will often pay attention to the ideological situation of the masses and help the propagandists carry out propaganda work.

　　中共旅大市委建立宣传网的情况与问题
    中共旅大市委宣传部
    去年五月，中共中央东北局宣传部召开企业宣传鼓动会议以后，旅大市很多企业单位在中共旅大市委领导下，已初步建立起宣传员制度。今年一月初，中共中央《关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定》公布后，旅大市委宣传部即指示所属各级党委，于一、二月内进行传达与讨论，学习与领会中央决定的精神，并检查过去的宣传工作。为了认真执行中央的决定，旅大市委又拟订了在四个月（三月——六月）中建立对人民群众宣传网的执行计划，并分别召开了工厂、农村、城市、机关、学校的宣传干部会议，作了讨论与研究。截至目前止，全市大多数工厂支部，均已学习了中央的决定，并开始建立或整顿宣传网。街坊支部都已普遍建立了宣传网的组织。农村中正在有重点的建立。少数的机关、学校中也已建立宣传网，并和区委会取得联系，但尚未进行宣传活动。现全市已有宣传员四千八百四十六名，市级报告员四十九名。
  批判各种错误认识
    旅大市在建立宣传网的过程中，认真批判了以下几种对宣传工作的错误思想：
    （一）把宣传工作与生产对立起来的思想。有些行政干部认为“宣传不宣传，机器一样转”、“宣传工作是无形的，完成任务是有形的，完不成生产任务要撤职查办，不作宣传工作没有关系”。针对这种思想，我们指出：我们是对工人宣传，不是对机器宣传；只有把工人的政治觉悟提高了，才能使掌握机器的工人把工作作得更好，才能提高产量与质量。否则生产任务就有可能完不成，行政干部就有可能被撤职查办。
    （二）认为强迫命令也能完成任务的思想。这一类的论调有“强迫命令也能完成任务”，“不强迫命令就完不成任务”，“做战勤工作可以强迫命令”，“强迫命令比说服教育省事得多”等等。对这些错误思想，我们指出：强迫命令虽然也能完成一两件具体任务，但会造成与群众的对立，会脱离群众，结果我们就会失败。并进而用阶级观点来分析，说明强迫命令是旧统治阶级的工作方法。而我党的主要工作方法是说服教育。
    （三）党组织不愿领导宣传网的思想。这种思想在支部内较普遍的是：认为宣传网工作由工会领导好，党可以通过工会领导宣传工作。他们说：“为什么党要直接来领导呢？党委的工作这样多，没法来领导宣传网。”我们以全体党员要“经常地直接地向广大人民群众进行宣传，更加密切党与群众的联系”（北京人民日报社论）来进行教育，说明党的宣传工作应成为党的日常工作，宣传工作是党领导群众保证完成任务的主要方法，党对人民群众的宣传工作作得好或坏，不仅关联到任务的完成，而且更重要的是关联到党和人民群众的联系。因此，各级党的组织应当认真的领导与组织宣传网。并进而指出：现在党已经是公开的党，党员和党的政策应该与群众直接见面，应该用党的名义进行党的宣传活动。
    （四）党员不愿做宣传工作的思想。这些人的借口是：“我的工作忙，没有时间干”，“我文化程度低，干不了”，“这是宣传干部的事，我不管”，或者“党章上规定党员都要做宣传工作，就不必建立宣传网了”。我们指出：党员以任何借口拒绝作宣传工作，都是违背党章的。
    党员不向群众进行宣传，群众的政治觉悟提不高，党员的工作就会更忙。借口工作忙而不做宣传工作，实质上就是一种认为只有强迫命令才能完成任务的错误思想。有些党员虽然文化程度低，但政治觉悟比群众高，对国内外形势，党与政府的政策，比群众认识得清楚，因此是可以向群众进行宣传的（当然，文化程度低的党员，还应该积极努力提高文化）。对某些认为党员既然都要做宣传工作，因而不必参加宣传网的人，我们指出：建立宣传网是为了有组织地进行宣传工作，有了宣传网这个组织，可以加强对宣传员的培养与训练，使宣传员得以提高宣传能力与水平。
    在整顿宣传网和发展宣传员的工作中，有个别支部内曾发生采用群众大会选举宣传员的方式，和支部通过宣传员名单后，尚未经上一级党组织批准即向群众宣布宣传员的现象。在吸收与洗刷宣传员的工作上，个别党组织尚存在着对宣传员要求过高或过低的现象。现在均已纠正。
  建立业务指导制度
    市委宣传部为了加强对宣传网的领导，除经常了解几个党委和支部建立宣传网和宣传员活动的情况外，还建立了下列各种具体指导宣传网工作的制度：
    （一）每月发一次与当前工作相结合的宣传指示，并举行宣传员业务座谈会，供给宣传员以资料。（二）市人民政府广播电台规定宣传员讲话时间，每星期三的中午与晚间广播两次。在这项广播中，宣传员最愿意听的是宣传工作经验介绍，尤其喜欢听宣传员亲自叙述他的工作方法。（三）旅大人民日报辟宣传员工作专栏，介绍经验。（四）举办支部书记业余训练班，讲授为什么要建立宣传网？怎样发展宣传员（宣传员的条件及发展手续）？宣传员如何进行工作？支部如何领导宣传网等问题。近来由于各支部工作很忙，要接连在晚间进行集体学习比较困难，因此今后拟改用讲座方式，事先印发讲授内容，每星期讲授一次。这样估计在上半年内也能将直属区的支部书记轮训一遍。
  宣传形式多种多样
    宣传员在进行宣传时利用了多种多样的宣传形式。计有：播音站，闪电报，光荣牌，生产立功日记表，表扬栏，考勤制度表，黑板报，漫画，标语，生产快报，读报广播，车间生产流动红旗，家属招待会，演讲比赛大会，废品展览室，生产战斗表（即生产进度表）等。这些宣传形式都极为群众所欢迎，并在生产中起了很大的推动作用。此外，个别谈话和报告会，座谈会则是普遍利用的一种宣传方式。春节中报告员结合时事、生产、学习等问题做报告。街坊的宣传员参加街坊居民会和识字班以及利用春节给群众“拜年”、串门等时间讲解时事。工厂中有的宣传员利用晚会、跳舞会会前后的空隙进行宣传。农村普遍利用干部回家过年的机会向农民进行报告。仅据金县、旅顺两地不完全统计，在春节中共举办报告会一百八十五次，听众约五万人。
  急待解决的几个问题
    目前宣传网工作中尚存在着以下几个急待解决的问题：
    一，一部分干部对宣传网工作缺乏应有的认识，还把建立宣传网当作是一种负担，或是认为日常工作和宣传网结合不起来。这些同志没有认识到作好宣传网工作正是保证各项工作完成的必需方法，也是密切党与群众联系的关键。建立宣传网必须结合当前工作任务来进行，只有结合日常各项工作（运动）建立起来的宣传网才能是巩固的宣传网。宣传网脱离各项运动，就没有丰富的活动内容，就一定是形式主义的。
    二、现在支部的书记及委员大多数是新提拔的干部，领导能力较弱；而建立宣传网又是一件新的工作，支部还不善于领导宣传员进行宣传活动，不知道应在支部内建立那些制度，不懂得怎样培养与教育宣传员。因此在工厂中党通过宣传员领导读报组、收音组或墙报编委会等组织，工会也通过文教委员会领导上述组织，但支部又不善于将党与工会的宣传活动结合起来进行。因此，有时发生党与工会争夺领导这些宣传组织的现象。我们已要求党委或总支加强培养支部的领导能力。市委宣传部也准备亲自试验领导一个工厂支部，研究支部领导宣传网工作中的各项问题，积累经验，以便推广。
    三、目前，已有个别宣传员产生骄傲自满脱离群众的现象。中山区一个宣传员出席东北宣传员代表会议后，便骄傲起来，不服从支部分配工作（现正纠正中）。因此，必需加强对宣传员的思想教育，使其认识宣传员是党联系群众的桥梁，必须与群众有密切的联系。同时必须培养宣传员谦虚的品质，在生产劳动和其他工作中，应以身作则，广泛地团结群众中的积极分子，来共同进行宣传工作。
    四、某些单位宣传员曾提出一些违背政策或是毫无思想性的鼓动口号。如船渠工厂在修某船时，宣传员提出“某日完成修船任务，奖励百分之五十”的单纯经济观点的鼓动口号，结果任务没能按期完成，工人们未得到奖励，结果，影响了情绪。某工厂一个工友攀高进行修理工作，工作完毕，不从梯子上下来，而从绳子上滑下来，违犯了技术规程。但该工厂的黑板报却错误地表扬他为“勇敢可嘉”。为了避免宣传员进行错误的或没有思想性的宣传鼓动，必须教育宣传员，加强宣传内容的思想性与政策性。同时还应迅速建立报告员制度。党的领导干部作了报告员后，就会经常注意到群众的思想情况和帮助宣传员进行宣传工作。
