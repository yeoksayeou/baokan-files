Xinhua News Agency, Kangzang Front, April 26th: The entire officers and soldiers of the 9th Daiben of the Tibetan Army, who gloriously revolted in the Qamdo campaign last October, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao on April 1st, reporting on their life and study since liberation. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To Chairman Mao, leader of all ethnic peoples of China:

During the New Year and Spring Festival, we presented you with Hada scarves and wished you good health. Now we are sending you a telegram to report on our life and study in the past six months. Under your great call, all our officers and soldiers, after returning to the embrace of the motherland, have received the same care from the People's Liberation Army brothers, and our living standards are the same as those of the People's Liberation Army. Through study, we have gradually established an unprecedented regular life system, learned from the example of the People's Liberation Army, and realized that the past behavior of oppressing the common people was wrong. At the same time, in the half-year of study, we have also deeply realized the imperialist conspiracy to invade Tibet. Now we are even more aware that the only path for all Tibetan people is to love our great family of all ethnic groups in China—the People's Republic of China. Only under the leadership of the Central People's Government and you can the Tibetan people be saved. Dear Chairman Mao! We have personally witnessed the American and British imperialists openly killing our compatriots and engaging in espionage activities in Tibet. Such cruel acts of aggression can no longer be tolerated. We are still working hard to study and actively transform ourselves, so that we can become a team that loves the people and is ever-victorious, just like the brotherly troops of the People's Liberation Army, so that in the near future, we can follow the People's Liberation Army to liberate our suffering hometown, drive out the American and British imperialist forces there, guard the border of the motherland, which is also our hometown, and participate in the construction of a prosperous new Tibet.

Respectfully presented by all officers and soldiers of the 9th Daiben, April 1st

　　起义的西藏军第九代本全体官兵
　  电毛主席报告生活和学习情形  　决心为解放受帝国主义残酷迫害的家乡而努力
    【新华社康藏前线二十六日电】去年十月在昌都战役中光荣起义的西藏军第九代本全体官兵，于四月一日致电毛主席，报告解放以来的生活及学习情形。电文如下：中国各民族人民的领袖毛主席：
    新年和春节的日子，我们曾向你献哈达拜年，并祝你身体安康，现在打电报给你，报告我们半年来的生活及学习情况。我们全体官兵在你的伟大号召之下，回到祖国怀抱后，得到这里的解放军兄弟一样的照顾，生活待遇都和解放军一样。经过学习，我们逐步建立了前所未有的正规的生活制度学习了解放军的榜样，认识了过去压迫老百姓的行为是错误的；同时在半年的学习中，我们也深刻认识到了帝国主义侵略西藏的阴谋。现在我们更认识到全西藏人民唯一的可走的道路，就是热爱我中华各民族的大家庭——中华人民共和国。只有在中央人民政府和你的领导下，西藏人民才能得救。亲爱的毛主席！我们过去曾亲眼看见过美、英帝国主义在西藏公开杀害我们同胞和进行特务活动，这种残酷的侵略行为，再不能容忍它继续下去了。我们现在还在努力学习，积极改造，使自己成为一支和解放军兄弟部队一样热爱人民、百战百胜的队伍，以便在不久的将来，跟随解放军一起，去解放我们苦难的家乡，驱逐那里的美、英帝国主义势力，把祖国的边疆也是我们的家乡守卫好，并参加到建设繁荣的新西藏的行列中。
              第九代本全体官兵上叩  四月一日
