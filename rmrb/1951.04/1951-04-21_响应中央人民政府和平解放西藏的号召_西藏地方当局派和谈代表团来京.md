Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 20th -- In response to the Central People's Government's call for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, so that the Tibetan people may return to the embrace of the motherland at an early date, the Tibetan local government has specially sent representatives to Beijing for negotiations. In February of this year, the Tibetan local government sent Fourth-Rank Official Tubdain Legmon and Sangzhupo Zhangse as representatives from Lhasa to Qamdo, and appointed Kalon (official rank) Ngapoi (Vice Chairman of the Qamdo Liberation Committee after the liberation of Qamdo), who was originally in Qamdo, as the chief representative to form a delegation. Ngapoi and his party set off from Qamdo on March 29th, passing through Ganzi, Kangding, Ya'an and other places, and were warmly welcomed by the Han people along the way. On April 16th, when they arrived in Chongqing, Wang Weizhou, Director of the Nationalities Affairs Committee of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, and General Li Da, Deputy Commander of the Southwest Military Region, went to the suburbs to welcome them. On the evening of the 17th, the leaders of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Southwest Military and Political Committee, and the Southwest Military Region hosted a banquet for the delegation and held a welcoming meeting. Deng Xiaoping, Secretary of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Liu Wenhui, Vice Chairman of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, and Wang Weizhou attended the meeting. Ngapoi said at the welcome meeting: The Communist Party, the People's Government, and the People's Liberation Army's sincere desire to cooperate with ethnic minorities is beyond imagination. He said that after the liberation of Xikang, the first Tibetan Autonomous Region (with its capital in Kangding) has been established, and they have personally seen that this autonomous government is the government of the Tibetan people themselves, where the Tibetan people have already escaped the suffering of Han chauvinism and imperialist rule. He said that for the sake of the happiness of the motherland and the Tibetan people, he is extremely willing to go to Beijing to make the negotiations a success, drive the imperialist forces out of Tibet as soon as possible, and bring the Tibetan people back to the warm family of the motherland. Ngapoi said: "Unity of all ethnic groups, driving out the enemy, and creating our own happy life, this is the purpose of our negotiations." The delegation also presented Hada scarves and Tibetan specialties as gifts to the Southwest military and political leaders. The delegation then set off for Beijing.

　　响应中央人民政府和平解放西藏的号召
    西藏地方当局派和谈代表团来京
    【新华社重庆二十日电】由于中央人民政府和平解放西藏使西藏同胞早日回到祖国大家庭来的号召，西藏地方当局特派代表赴北京谈判。今年二月，西藏地方当局派出四品官土登列闷及桑株颇章色二人为代表，自拉萨前来昌都，并授命原在昌都的噶伦（官阶）阿沛（昌都解放后任昌都解放委员会副主任）为首席代表组成代表团。阿沛等一行于三月二十九日自昌都启程，行经甘孜、康定、雅安等处，沿途均受汉族人民的热烈欢迎。四月十六日抵达重庆时，西南军政委员会民族事务委员会王维舟主任委员及西南军区副司令员李达将军等，亲赴市郊欢迎。十七日晚中共中央西南局、西南军政委员会、西南军区等机关首长欢宴代表团，并举行欢迎会。中共中央西南局书记邓小平、西南军政委员会副主席刘文辉、王维舟等均莅会。阿沛在欢迎会上表示：共产党、人民政府及人民解放军这种与少数民族真诚合作的愿望，为意想所不及。他说，西康解放后，已经成立了第一个藏族自治区（首府在康定），他们亲眼看见了这个自治政府是藏族人民自己的政府，在这里藏族人民业已摆脱了大汉族主义和帝国主义统治的苦难。他说，为了祖国和西藏人民的幸福，极愿赴北京和谈成功，早日驱逐帝国主义势力出西藏，使西藏人民回到温暖的祖国大家庭来。阿沛说：“各族团结，驱逐敌人，创造自己的幸福生活，这就是我们谈判的目的。”代表团并向西南军政首长敬献哈达及西藏特产为礼物。代表团一行即启程赴北京。
