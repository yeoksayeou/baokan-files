　　A Mountain Village Cooperative on the Right Track
　　Li Fu
　　The reporter recently visited the Yangjiazhai Farmers' Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yuanshi County, Taihang Mountain area. Thanks to the correct implementation of the people's government's policy of developing cooperatives, the economic life of the farmers in this mountain village has greatly changed.
　　Yangjiazhai, located sixty miles away from Yuanshi City in a remote mountain valley, has very inconvenient transportation. In the past, the whole village of one hundred and ninety-eight households had only four carts and ninety donkeys. Farmers were often restricted by short legs and little money when buying and selling things. Because the grain, eggs, peanuts... in the farmers' hands piled up and could not be sold, private merchants took the opportunity to come to the mountains to catch "fools." The farmers' hard-earned products of the year were sold for almost nothing; and the industrial products here were extremely expensive. Take the "hairnets" commonly used by women as an example. In the past, buying such a small thing would cost two liters of grain. In terms of harvest, Yangjiazhai often had a surplus of thirty to forty thousand kilograms of grain every year, but the farmers' lives did not improve quickly.
　　People were in great need of a cooperative to sell their agricultural products and exchange them for industrial products. However, the original cooperative in Yangjiazhai, like other village cooperatives, took a detour. In the past, they traded with non-members, simply wanting to make money, and did not concentrate on serving the members. Therefore, the members' local products could not be effectively sold, and the industrial products they needed could not be exchanged. As a result, this cooperative, which was established as early as 1947, had its membership reduced from five hundred and fifty-two to three hundred and six by the beginning of last year; and the capital had also decreased by nine-tenths compared to the initial establishment, leaving only one hundred and fifty-three yuan.
　　In April last year, at the urgent request of the members, the Yangjiazhai Cooperative was rectified in accordance with the new supply and marketing policy. They democratically elected directors and supervisors, stopped trading with general non-members, and did their best to serve the members. In order to purchase and sell goods according to the needs of the members, it was decided that members would make two "family planning" plans every year: in the spring, make a plan for the seeds, fertilizers, agricultural tools or living materials that need to be purchased; after the autumn harvest, make a plan for the local products that need to be sold and the items that need to be purchased. According to this plan, during the spring plowing and sowing last year, the cooperative purchased three hundred and twenty-six pieces of agricultural tools such as plowshares, hoes, and shovels needed by the members from Zanhuang County, and purchased one thousand kilograms of cotton seeds, eighty kilograms of vegetable seeds, eleven thousand nine hundred and fifty-nine kilograms of coal, and eighteen thousand kilograms of oil cake for fertilizer from Yuanshi County. These things were sold to the members very cheaply. Plowshares cost 18,000 yuan on the market, but the cooperative only sold them for 12,000 yuan. Daily necessities such as oil, salt, cloth, and matches used by the members have been rationed at fixed times and quantities since May last year with the support of state-owned trading companies and higher-level cooperatives. In the past year, the county cooperative supplied the Yangjiazhai Cooperative with 7,200 kilograms of edible salt, 200,000 kilograms of coal, 2,400 packages of matches, 1,240 kilograms of alkali noodles, 1,200 kilograms of kerosene, and a large number of foreign cloth and fertilizers at an average price of 23% lower than the local market price. These cheap commodities saved the members 5.75 million yuan.
　　In order to solve the shortage of funds for purchasing agricultural products, the Yangjiazhai Cooperative signed a material exchange contract with the higher-level cooperative and the state-owned trading company according to the "family planning" of the members' sale of local products and purchase of goods after the autumn harvest. In this way, the members could take a liter of grain, a bowl of beans, or a few eggs to the cooperative at a reasonable price in exchange for industrial products. In total, over the past year, the cooperative exchanged agricultural and sideline products such as wheat, miscellaneous grains, eggs, peanuts, cotton, and wool from the members through this method, worth more than 44.7 million yuan; and supplied the members with various living and production materials worth a total of 57.5 million yuan. Through this exchange, the members saved 900 man-days and more than 700 animal-days for buying and selling goods. Whenever the members talked about these things, they said with great excitement: "The cooperative is like the blood vessels in a person's body. With it, the lives of the people are active."
　　The Yangjiazhai Cooperative has also summarized an experience in its work, that is, the supply business must have "connectivity", otherwise it cannot fully meet the needs of the members. For example, if you run pigments, you must have stinky alkali and black alum; if you don't run the farmers' superstitious items, you must run medical supplies. When insect pests occurred in the mutual aid groups of farmer members, the Yangjiazhai Cooperative not only supplied the members with sufficient amounts of insecticides such as tobacco leaves, alkali noodles, lime, and DDT, but also borrowed sprayers from the county farm, and the cooperative cadres personally went to the fields to help the members control the insects and taught the control methods to the farmers in the whole village, so that 230 mu of farmland was spared from disasters. In this way, it was of course greatly welcomed by the members.
　　After autumn last year, turning to the winter slack season, the Yangjiazhai Cooperative organized members to engage in winter production according to the family planning of farmer members. At first, only 90 people were organized to collect firewood and 80 people to spin and weave, and the cooperative was responsible for buying and selling. Later, the members felt that ginning was inconvenient and the sales of oil were difficult, so the cooperative organized more than 10 people to gin, 20 people to press oil, and 40 people to transport, so that more than 400 members in the whole village had work to do.
　　The Yangjiazhai Cooperative is one of the thousands of rural supply and marketing cooperatives in the old liberated areas of Hebei Province. They implemented the policy that cooperatives should concentrate all their efforts on meeting the needs of their members, so their prestige has been unprecedentedly improved. Now the members of the Yangjiazhai Cooperative have developed from 306 before the rectification to 556, accounting for 81% of the village's population. The capital has also increased from 1.53 million yuan to 6.5 million yuan.

　　一个走上正轨的山村合作社
    力夫
    记者最近访问了太行山区元氏县杨家寨的农民供销合作社。由于正确实现了人民政府发展合作社的政策，这个山村里的农民的经济生活已大大地变了样。
    离元氏城六十里地，处于深山僻谷中的杨家寨，交通十分不便。全村一百九十八户人家，过去只有四辆大车，九十头毛驴。农民们买卖东西，经常受着腿短钱少的限制。因为农民手里的粮食、鸡蛋、花生……堆着卖不出去，私商便乘机到山里捉“老憨”，农民辛苦一年的产物，就这样一文不值半文地出售了；而这里的工业品却又贵得要命。拿妇女们通常用的“髻网”来说吧，过去买这样个小小的东西就得二升粮食。按收成说，杨家寨每年常剩余三、四万斤粮食，可是农民们的生活，却提高的并不快。
    人们是多么需要个合作社来为自己推销农产品，换取工业品。但是，杨家寨原来的合作社，也和别的村社一样，走了弯路。他们过去和非社员交易，单纯想赚钱，没有集中力量为社员服务，因此，社员们的土产既不能有效地推销出去，他们所需要的工业品也不能换回来。于是，这个远从一九四七年即已成立的合作社，到去年年初，社员竟从五百五十二个减少到三百零六个；资金也比初办时减少了十分之九，只剩下一百五十三万元了。
    去年四月，在社员们的迫切要求下，杨家寨合作社按照新的供销方针进行了整顿。他们民主地选举了理监事，停止了与一般非社员交易，尽全力为社员服务。为着按社员的需要，进销货物，决定每年让社员做两个“安家计划”：春天做需要购买的种籽、肥料、农具或生活资料的计划；秋后做需要推销的土产与购买的物品的计划。合作社按照这种计划，去年春耕播种时，就到赞皇县采购了社员所需要的犁铧、锄、锹等农具三百二十六件，到元氏县购来棉籽一千斤、菜籽八十斤、煤炭一万一千九百五十九斤和做肥料用的油饼一万八千斤。这些东西卖给社员都很便宜。犁铧市价一万八千元，合作社只卖一万二千元。社员们日常用的油、盐、布匹、火柴等生活资料，从去年五月份起就在国营贸易公司及上级社的支持下，实行了定时定量的配售。去年一年内，县社以平均低于当地市价百分之二十三的价格供给了杨家寨合作社食盐七千二百斤、煤炭二十万斤、火柴二千四百包、碱面一千二百四十斤、煤油一千二百斤和大批洋布、肥料。这些廉价商品使社员节省了五百七十五万元。
    杨家寨合作社为解决收购农产品资金短少的困难，按社员秋后推销土产与购买物品的“安家计划”、与上级社和国营贸易公司订立了物资交换合同。这样，社员们可以随便拿一升谷子、一碗豆子或几个鸡蛋，到社里按合理的价格交换工业品。总计一年来，合作社经过这种方式换购社员的小麦、杂粮、鸡蛋、花生、棉花、羊毛等农副业产品共值四千四百七十多万元；供给社员的各种生活资料和生产资料共值五千七百五十万元。经过这种交换，社员节约了买卖物品的人工九百个、畜工七百多个。社员们一谈起这些事，都眉飞色舞地说：“合作社像人身上的血脉，有了它老百姓的日子就活动了。”
    杨家寨合作社在工作中还总结出一条经验，就是供应业务要有“连带性”，否则便不能完全满足社员的需要。如既经营颜料，就要有臭碱、黑矾；既不经营农民的迷信品，就要经营医药用品。农民社员的互助组里发生虫害，杨家寨合作社不仅供给社员足量的烟叶、碱面、石灰、滴滴涕等杀虫药剂，还从县农场借来喷雾器，由合作社干部亲自下地帮助社员治虫，并把治法教给全村农民，使二百三十亩田免除了灾害。这样，当然更大大地受到社员的欢迎。
    去年秋后转向冬闲，杨家寨合作社又按照农民社员的安家计划，组织社员冬季生产。起初只组织了九十个人打柴，八十个人纺织，里买外卖由合作社负责。后来社员感到轧花不便，油料推销困难，合作社又组织了十余人轧花，二十人榨油，四十人运输，这样全村就有四百多个社员有了活干。
    杨家寨合作社是河北省老解放区千百个农村供销合作社中的一个。他们实行了合作社应集中全力满足社员需要的方针，所以威信空前提高。现在杨家寨合作社的社员已由整顿前的三百零六人发展到五百五十六人，占全村人口的百分之八十一。资金也由一百五十三万元增加到六百五十万元。
