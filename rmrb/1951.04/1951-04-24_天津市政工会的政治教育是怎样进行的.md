　　How the Tianjin Municipal Trade Union Carries Out Political Education
　　Fang Xin

　　After liberation, the Tianjin Municipal Trade Union, like other factories and enterprises, first carried out political enlightenment education for municipal workers. Initially, this took the form of large lectures, followed by training classes. A total of four training classes were held, each lasting ten to fifteen days, training a total of seven to eight hundred people. All units within the municipal system, such as the tram company, bus company, and water company, selected some activists to study. The lectures mainly focused on the current situation and urban policies. The training classes were very successful. After training, workers gained a new understanding of politics, their enthusiasm for production increased, and they established a new attitude towards labor. Now, the cadres of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union in the factories, as well as the section and team leaders in administration, have mostly been promoted after training. They have become the backbone of various tasks in the enterprises.

　　After the development of after-work cultural learning, the training classes were suspended, but the after-work political education of the Tianjin Municipal Trade Union staff and workers did not stop. It has continued to this day and has created a method of using broadcasting for political learning, which has been welcomed by the workers.

　　After-work cultural learning occupied the evening time, so the Public Utilities Bureau decided that the one and a half hours before work in the morning (7:00 to 8:30 AM) would be the time for political and technical learning (political learning was conducted twice a week). The learning of staff members was conducted according to the plans of the enterprise Party Committee's Learning Committee (four times a week), mainly self-study, and after completing each chapter or problem, a specialist would answer questions.

　　Because municipal factories were scattered, the Tianjin People's Broadcasting Station's worker channel was used for political education. The time was from 7:00 to 8:00 AM every Tuesday and Friday. This has been continuous from the beginning to the present. According to March statistics, there are currently 49 listening groups, with 4,424 people listening.

　　At the beginning of the broadcast, workers who listened reflected: "The sound is not clear," and "What is being said is too fast, it just rushes by." Based on the opinions of the masses, the tone was adjusted, the speed of speech was slowed down, and important points were repeated and explained more. Before starting to explain a problem, the issues existing in the workers' minds were collected, so that the content of the lectures was combined with the thinking of the masses. Because the lecturers were giving lectures by radio and did not meet with the masses, it was difficult to grasp the emotions of the listeners. Later, several workers were invited to sit in the broadcasting room during each broadcast. The lecturers paid attention to the reactions of the workers while lecturing.

　　In terms of organizing listening, at the beginning, the organization was not sound. After the lecture was over, it was over. There was no organization for everyone to discuss, and there was no place to solve problems. Later, various systems were established according to needs. Each listening unit (generally a workshop) established an assistant teacher (mostly responsible persons from the Party, administration, and trade union). During the lecture, the assistant teacher would write on the blackboard; after the lecture, they would help answer questions raised by the workers and often reflect the ideological situation of the workers to the lecturers.

　　In order to conduct inspections, tests were also held frequently. Because the workers' cultural level was low, they could not answer in writing, so the method of drawing "ten" and "one" marks was used for testing. Those with excellent results were rewarded.

　　The reporting system was also well maintained. Each listening unit could generally report the learning situation to the higher authorities on time (once every two weeks).

　　In order to ensure good learning, the workers also formulated learning covenants.

　　Because the broadcast could be held on time, and the learning time was administratively stipulated, there were very few cases of workers arriving late or leaving early. When the time came, the bell rang, and everyone gathered to listen to the lecture in an orderly manner. Recently, the slogan of eliminating "white spots" was put forward, and everyone who could leave work was organized to listen to the lecture. For example, in the Hexi Automobile Repair Factory, except for the guards, all the workers went to listen to the lecture.

　　The content of the broadcast mainly consisted of political education, but also interspersed with some production issues. From the beginning to the present, it has covered the history of social development, the history of the New Democratic Revolution, the worker flag Zhao Zhankui, the nature of American imperialism, the introduction of the Soviet Union, Resist America, Aid Korea, Korean communications, opposing American imperialist arming of Japan, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, launching patriotic production competitions, and the production responsibility system. After listening to the history of the New Democratic Revolution, some workers said: "I always thought that Chiang Kai-shek is not good now, but that he wasn't so bad in the past. After listening, I realized that Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the people during the Great Revolution." After listening to "Introduction to the Soviet Union," an old worker, Guo Jisheng, said: "Let's build the new China as soon as possible so that our descendants can enjoy happiness as soon as possible!" He took the initiative to sign a master-apprentice contract with his apprentice. The Korean war zone communications and the report on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were even more popular with the workers. During the discussion, the workers were emotional and said, "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we avenge ourselves." And they proposed to guarantee the patriotic production competition and help the government eliminate counter-revolutionary elements.

　　The workers were satisfied with the broadcast. They said, "It is clear and easy to understand," "What I didn't know or didn't understand, I understand after listening to the broadcast," "This is much better than reading the newspaper, because reading the newspaper is just reciting, and some words are not clear and the meaning is not clear."

　　Because political education can be regularly maintained, the workers' consciousness has been improved. They are in high spirits and full of energy. In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the workers automatically launched the "Thousand Yuan Movement" to aid the Korean people, launched a condemnation movement against American imperialism arming Japan; and automatically challenged the Ma Hengchang team.

　　In order for the field workers to participate in listening to the lectures, there are plans to record the speeches into documentaries and give them supplementary lectures.

　　天津市政工会的政治教育是怎样进行的
    方新
    解放以后，天津市政工会和其他工厂企业一样，曾首先向市政工人进行了政治启蒙教育。开始是上大课，以后举办训练班。训练班一共办了四班，每期十天到十五天，共训练了七、八百人。凡市政系统的各单位，如电车公司、公共汽车公司、自来水公司等单位，都挑选了一些积极分子去学习，讲课内容主要是目前形势与城市政策。短期训练班的成绩是很大的。工人经过训练以后在政治上都有了新的认识，生产热情也提高了，树立起新的劳动态度。现在工厂中的党、青年团、工会的干部，以及行政上的班股长，大都是经过训练后提拔起来的，他们已成为企业中各种工作的骨干。
    业余文化学习开展以后，训练班停办了，但市政工会职工业余政治教育并没有停止，一直坚持到现在，并且创造了用广播进行政治学习的方法，受到工人群众的欢迎。
    业余文化学习占用了晚上时间，公用局就决定早晨上工前一个半小时（七点到八点半）为政治与技术学习的时间（政治学习每周进行两次）。职员的学习则根据企业党委学委会的计划进行（每周四次），主要是自学，每学完一章或一个问题，由专人解答问题。
    因市政工厂分散，就利用天津人民广播电台职工台进行政治教育。时间是每星期二、五早晨七时到八时。从开始到现在，一直没有间断过。据三月份统计，现有四十九个收听组，听讲人数四千四百二十四人。
    在开始广播的时候，收听的工友曾反映：“声音不清楚”，“讲的太快了，一溜就过去。”根据群众的意见，调节了音调，把讲话的速度放慢，重要的地方重复几句，多加解释。在开始讲一个问题之前，收集工人思想中存在的问题，使讲课内容与群众思想结合起来。由于讲课人是用广播讲课，和群众不见面，听众的情绪不好掌握，后来就在每次广播时，请几位工人同去坐在广播室里。讲课人一边讲，一边注意几位工人同志的反映。
    在组织收听上，刚开始的时候，组织不健全，讲完了也就完了，没有组织大家讨论，有了问题也没处解决。后来就根据需要建立了各种制度，由各收听单位（一般是车间）设立一个助教（大都由党、行政、工会的负责人担任）。讲课的时候，助教就在黑板上写；讲课以后，则帮助解答工人所提出的疑难问题，并经常把工人中的思想情况反映给讲课人。
    为了进行检查，还经常地举行测验。由于工人文化程度低，不能用笔答，就采用划“十”“一”号的办法进行测验。成绩优良的则给予奖励。
    汇报制度也坚持得比较好。各收听单位一般都能按时（两周一次）向上面汇报学习情况。
    为了保证学习得好，工人还订立了学习公约。
    因为广播能按时举行，加上学习时间是行政规定的，工人中很少有迟到早退的现象。时间一到，铃声一响，大家便集合起来听课，很有秩序。最近更提出了消灭“白点”的口号，把一切可以离开工作的人都组织起来听课。例如河西汽车修理厂除守卫的以外，工人都去听课。
    广播内容，主要是进行政治教育，也穿插了一些生产问题。从开始到现在，曾讲过社会发展史，新民主主义革命史，工人旗帜赵占魁，美帝国主义的本质，苏联介绍，抗美援朝，朝鲜通讯，反对美帝国主义武装日本，镇压反革命，开展爱国主义生产竞赛，生产责任制等。听了新民主主义革命史以后，有的工人说：“我总以为蒋介石现在不好，以往还不算坏吧，听了以后，我才知道蒋介石在大革命时期就叛变了人民。”老工友郭吉生听了“苏联介绍”以后。说：“快点把新中国建设起来吧，让我们的后代早日享福！”他主动地和徒弟订立了师徒合同。朝鲜战地通讯和镇压反革命的报告更受到工人的欢迎。讨论时，工人情绪激昂，说“只有在共产党、毛主席领导下，才能给咱们报仇雪恨”。并提出保证搞好爱国主义生产竞赛，帮助政府肃清反革命分子。
    工人对广播是满意的，他们说：“讲的清楚明白”，“不知道的，不明白的，一听广播就晓得了。”，“这比读报好得多，因为读报光是念，有的字听不清，意思也不明白。”
    由于政治教育的能够经常坚持，工人觉悟就有所提高，他们情绪高，劲头足。在抗美援朝运动中，工人自动地发起援助朝鲜人民的“千元运动”，开展反对美帝国主义武装日本的控诉运动；并自动向马恒昌小组应战。
    为了使外勤工人也能参加听讲，现在计划把讲演词灌成记录片，给他们进行补讲。
