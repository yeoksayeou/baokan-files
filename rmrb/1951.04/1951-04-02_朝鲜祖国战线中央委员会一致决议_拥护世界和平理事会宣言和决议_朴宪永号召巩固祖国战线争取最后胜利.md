　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 31st – The Central Committee of the Korean Democratic United Fatherland Front held a meeting on March 12th.

　　The meeting heard Park Heon-yeong's report on "The Current Situation and the Tasks of Various Democratic Political Parties and Social Organizations." Park Heon-yeong pointed out that the Korean and Chinese People's Armies are continuing their efforts to annihilate the enemy's active forces, inflicting heavier blows on the enemy. The just nature of the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War is the fundamental factor for the war's victory.

　　Park Heon-yeong emphasized the necessity of consolidating the Fatherland Front. He said: During the Fatherland Liberation War, the various political parties and social organizations under the banner of the Fatherland Front have united around the government of the Republic, making our strength even greater. Party members and league members of various political parties and social organizations, led by the Korean Workers' Party, have stood at the forefront of the war, demonstrating exemplary roles and dedication. However, individual members of the Fatherland Front still have shortcomings in their work. For example, patriotic members of the Young Friends Party and the Democratic Party have performed well in the Fatherland Liberation War. Some of the young party members of these parties have joined the People's Army and become brave soldiers, and many party members support the policies of our Republic government. However, because these two parties failed to promptly eliminate the bad elements who had infiltrated the party, lacked political vigilance in their daily activities, and did not carry out the internal party struggle to purify the party ranks sufficiently, bad elements in these two parties played a significant negative role when the enemy occupied the northern half of the country and massacred the people last year. This fact is a great lesson for the various political parties affiliated with the Fatherland Front. I call on the various political parties participating in the Fatherland Front to consolidate their ranks, to pay attention to strengthening the united front, so that we can more smoothly achieve the final victory.

　　Park Heon-yeong then pointed out that this war is a war that determines the life and death of our nation and will not be stopped halfway. He put forward the following tasks to the various democratic political parties and social organizations affiliated with the Fatherland Front and the people of the whole country: rapidly restore and strengthen grassroots people's political power organizations, eliminate reactionary elements, consolidate the rear, actively support the front, complete spring plowing, vigorously carry out relief to stabilize people's lives, strengthen the work of the Fatherland Front, and launch strict criticism and struggle.

　　The meeting also heard Park Jeong-ae's report on "The World Peace Council's Declaration Requesting the Conclusion of a Peace Pact by the Five Great Powers and the Peace Council's Resolution on the United Nations." After a heated discussion of the above report, the meeting unanimously passed the corresponding resolution.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 31st – At the meeting on March 12th, the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic United Fatherland Front, after hearing Park Jeong-ae's report on the World Peace Council's declaration requesting the five great powers to conclude a peace pact and the resolution on the United Nations, unanimously passed the following decision:

　　1. Fully support the "Declaration on the Conclusion of a Peace Pact" issued by the World Peace Council, because this declaration fully conforms to the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world and the Korean people.

　　2. Fully support and endorse the World Peace Council's "Resolution on the United Nations." Because the United Nations has further disappointed the people's expectations of it, and because it passed a resolution condemning China as an "aggressor," the people's disappointment has reached its peak. The United Nations has approved and shielded the United States army in killing nearly one million people in Korea, including the elderly, women, and children, and has destroyed and burned Korean cities and villages, turning them into rubble.

　　3. The Central Committee of the Fatherland Front believes that all the Korean people will fully support and endorse the above-mentioned declaration and resolution of the World Peace Council, so that the military adventures of the chief culprit of the new war provocateurs – the US imperialists – will end in a shameful failure on the Korean battlefield. The Korean people are not only determined to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland, but also determined to contribute to the peace and security of the world.

　　朝鲜祖国战线中央委员会一致决议        
    拥护世界和平理事会宣言和决议        
    朴宪永号召巩固祖国战线争取最后胜利
    【新华社平壤三十一日电】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会于三月十二日举行会议。
    会议听取了朴宪永关于“目前形势与各民主政党、社会团体的任务”的报告。朴宪永指出：朝、中人民军队正继续努力歼灭敌人的有生力量，使敌人遭受更沉重的打击。朝鲜人民所进行的祖国解放战争的正义性质，是战争胜利的基本因素。
    朴宪永强调必须巩固祖国战线。他说：在祖国解放战争中，祖国战线旗帜下的各政党与社会团体一致团结在共和国政府的周围，使我们的力量更加壮大了。以朝鲜劳动党为首的各政党、社会团体的党员和盟员们，站在战争的前列，发挥了模范作用和献身精神。但是，祖国战线所属的个别成员在工作中还有着缺点。例如青友党和民主党的爱国党员在祖国解放战争中曾表现得很好，该党的青年党员中有的参加了人民军而变成勇敢的战士，并且有许多党员是支持我们共和国政府的政策的。但由于该两党未能及时肃清混入党内的坏分子，在日常活动中缺乏政治警惕性，纯洁党的队伍的党内斗争进行得不够，因此，在去年敌人侵占北半部屠杀人民时，该两党中的坏分子就曾起了不少的坏作用。这一事实对于祖国战线所属各政党是很大的教训。我号召参加祖国战线的各个政党巩固自己的队伍，要关心加强统一战线，使我们更顺利地取得最后的胜利。
    朴宪永接着指出：这一战争是决定我民族生死存亡的战争，决不中途停止。他向祖国战线所属的各民主政党、社会团体及全国人民提出如下的任务：迅速恢复与加强基层人民政权组织，肃清反动分子，巩固后方，积极支援前线，完成春耕工作，大力进行救济安定人民生活，加强祖国战线的工作，展开严格的批评斗争。
    会议并听取了朴正爱关于“世界和平理事会要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言及和平理事会关于联合国的决议”的报告。会议在热烈地讨论了上述报告后，一致通过了相应的决议。
    【新华社平壤三十一日电】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会在三月十二日的会议上听取了朴正爱关于世界和平理事会要求五强缔结和平公约的宣言和关于联合国的决议的报告后，一致通过了如下的决定：
    一、完全支持世界和平理事会所发表的“关于缔结和平公约”的宣言，因为这个宣言完全符合全世界爱好和平人民和朝鲜人民的愿望。
    二、完全支持与赞同世界和平理事会“关于联合国的决议”。因为联合国已更进一步地辜负了人民对它的期望，并且由于通过了谴责中国为“侵略者”的决议，而使人民的失望达于顶点。联合国批准和掩护美国军队在朝鲜杀害了近一百万人民，其中包括老人、妇女和儿童，并且摧毁和焚烧了朝鲜的城市和乡村，使之化为瓦砾。
    三、祖国战线中央委员会相信：全体朝鲜人民一定会完全支持和赞同世界和平理事会上述的宣言与决议，使新战争挑拨者的元凶——美帝国主义者在朝鲜战场上的军事冒险以可耻的失败而告终。朝鲜人民不仅决心保卫祖国的独立与自由，并决心对世界的和平安全有所贡献。
