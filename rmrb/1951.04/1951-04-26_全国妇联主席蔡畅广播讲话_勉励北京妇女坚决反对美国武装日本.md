All-China Women's Federation President Cai Chang's Broadcast Speech
　　Encouraging Beijing Women to Resolutely Oppose American Arming of Japan
(Our newspaper's report) At the Beijing Women's Broadcast Denunciation Rally Against American Arming of Japan on the 24th, a letter was passed expressing respect and determination to Cai Chang, President of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation. After hearing this letter on the radio, Comrade Cai Chang called the chairman of the meeting and broadcast a speech to hundreds of thousands of listeners throughout the city via telephone.
The letter from the meeting to Comrade Cai Chang reads:
Dear Comrade Cai Chang:
    We, more than 100,000 women in Beijing, held a broadcast denunciation rally against the American arming of Japan. We listened to four sisters denouncing the crimes of Japanese imperialism, American imperialism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. We are filled with grief and indignation. We know that under the aggression of imperialism, we women suffer the most and the deepest. Therefore, we are writing to you specifically to express our determination. We assure you that we women in Beijing will respond to your call to strengthen unity and, together with the people of the entire city and the entire country, resolutely support the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers and resolutely oppose the American arming of Japan. We will work hard to do a good job in resisting America and aiding Korea, safeguarding our good life, and safeguarding our children. We wish you good health and extend our highest respect.

Comrade Cai Chang's broadcast speech
Comrade Chairman of the Beijing Women's Broadcast Denunciation Rally:
    I have heard the letter from the meeting. Now, please allow me to take this opportunity to say a few words to the sisters throughout the city.
    First of all, let me express my deep condolences to the four sisters who just made their denunciations.
    These bloody denunciations are a record of the common suffering of the Chinese people, especially Chinese women, in the past. These ironclad facts prove that the suffering of Chinese women was caused single-handedly by the heinous Japanese imperialism, American imperialism, and their running dogs in China, the Kuomintang reactionaries.
    This deep hatred is something that every kind-hearted Chinese, every Chinese with national self-esteem, and every peace-loving Chinese can never forget and will never forget.
    When American imperialism attempts to expand its war of aggression, arrogantly wants to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, and rearm Japan, we must gather together the pain and humiliation we have suffered in the past and turn it into the strength to fight American imperialism. We must combine this strength with our regular work and actions, and formulate patriotic pledges to implement them. We must also, together with the peace-loving people of the entire country and the entire world, actively participate in signing in support of the conclusion of a peace pact and voting for a peaceful resolution of the Japanese issue. Sisters, only in this way can we strive for the early arrival of the final victory in resisting America and aiding Korea. Only then can we effectively safeguard the security of Asia and world peace, and only then can we safeguard our own good life and our children.
    The sisters in Beijing, especially since the patriotic parade to resist America and aid Korea in January of this year, have done a lot of work and achieved many successes. The movement to resist America and aid Korea has seen new developments among women. Taking just this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day, the city and various districts, factories, organizations, schools, and other units, in conjunction with the propaganda work of resisting America and aiding Korea, held many meetings, large and small… On "March 8th" alone, more than 200,000 women went to the Working People's Cultural Palace to participate in the garden party. Today, more than 100,000 sisters are together holding this broadcast denunciation rally so enthusiastically and vividly. These not only show that the consciousness of the sisters in the capital has been raised and demonstrate the determination and strength of the sisters in the capital to oppose American imperialist aggression and defend peace, but also prove that our movement to resist America and aid Korea, with everyone's unity and efforts, will definitely continue to expand and improve.
    Dear sisters! The approaching "May 1st" Labor Day is a new high tide in the national movement to resist America and aid Korea. We should step up the propaganda work of resisting America and aiding Korea in preparation for the arrival of "May 1st," actively participate in the "May 1st" demonstration parade, and hope that the sisters in the capital will participate in the "May 1st" parade as enthusiastically as possible and with as many people as possible. In this way, our movement to resist America and aid Korea can be made more widespread and in-depth. And gradually achieve the goal of enabling every place and every woman in the capital to receive patriotic education in resisting America and aiding Korea.
    Sisters of the meeting, I am very moved by the letter you wrote to me. I was so moved that I shed tears. In addition to expressing excitement and emotion, I also thank the sisters throughout the city. I wish you success in your future production, work, and study in fulfilling your patriotic pledges; strengthening unity, and working with the people of the city and the country to resolutely support the conclusion of a peace pact, resolutely oppose American arming of Japan, and work hard to do a good job in resisting America and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, to defend our motherland, defend our good life, and defend our children.
              Cai Chang, April 24th

　　全国妇联主席蔡畅广播讲话
　  勉励北京妇女坚决反对美国武装日本
    【本报讯】二十四日，北京妇女反对美国武装日本广播控诉大会上，通过了一封向中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅致敬并表示决心的信。蔡畅同志从广播中听到了这封信后，即给大会主席打电话，并通过电话向全市数十万听众广播讲话。
  大会写给蔡畅同志的信亲爱的蔡畅同志：
    我们北京妇女十万多人举行了一个反对美国武装日本的广播控诉大会，我们听了四位姊妹控诉日本帝国主义、美帝国主义和国民党反动派的罪行。我们悲愤万分，我们知道在帝国主义的侵略底下，我们妇女是受害最多、受害最深的。因此，我们特意给您写信，表示我们的决心。我们向您保证，我们北京的妇女一定响应您的号召加强团结和全市全国人民一起，坚决拥护五大国缔结和平公约，坚决反对美国武装日本。努力做好抗美援朝工作，保卫我们的好光景，保卫我们的孩子，祝您健康，并致最崇高的敬礼
          北京市妇女反对美国武装日本广播控诉大会
        一九五一年四月二十四日
  蔡畅同志的广播讲话北京市妇女广播控诉大会的主席同志：
    大会给我的信，我已经听到了。现在请你允许我借这个机会，向全市的姐妹们来讲几句话。
    首先，让我向刚才进行控诉的四位姐妹致深切的慰问。
    这些血一般的控诉，中国人民，特别是中国妇女过去共同受过的痛苦生活。这些铁一般的事实证明了中国妇女的痛苦，是由万恶的日本帝国主义、美国帝国主义和他在中国的走狗国民党反动派他们一手造成的。
    这种深仇大恨，是每一个善良的中国人，有民族自尊心的中国人，爱好和平的中国人永远不能忘记，也永远不会忘记的。
    当美帝国主义企图扩大侵略战争，狂妄地要单独对日媾和，重新武装日本的时候，我们要把过去所受过的这些痛苦和耻辱，汇集起来，变成我们打击美帝国主义的斗争力量，要把这种力量，结合经常的工作和行动，订出爱国公约来贯彻执行。并且与全国、全世界爱好和平的人民一道，积极参加拥护缔结和平公约的签名与对于和平解决日本问题的投票，姐妹们，我们只有这样，我们才能争取抗美援朝的最后胜利早日到来。我们才能有效地保卫亚洲的安全与世界的和平，也才能保卫我们自己的好光景和我们的孩子。
    北京市的姊妹，特别自今年一月间举行抗美援朝爱国游行以来，做了不少工作，获得了很多的成绩。抗美援朝运动，在妇女中，又有了新的开展：单就今年“三八”节来看，全市及各区、各工厂、机关、学校等单位，结合了抗美援朝宣传工作，举行了许许多多、大大小小的座谈会、纪念会……，“三八”那天，就有二十多万妇女到劳动人民文化宫参加游园大会。今天，又有十几万姊妹们在一块这样热烈，这样生动地举行了这个广播控诉大会。这些不但表示了首都姊妹们的觉悟提高了，显示了首都姊妹们反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫和平的决心和力量，同时，证明了我们的抗美援朝运动，在大家的团结和努力之下，是一定会再继续扩大和提高起来的。
    亲爱的姊妹们！快要到来的“五一”劳动节，是全国抗美援朝运动的一个新的高潮，我们应该为迎接“五一”的到来，加紧抗美援朝的宣传工作，积极参加“五一”节的示威游行，并且希望首都姊妹们参加“五一”节游行的越热烈、人数越多越好。这样就能使我们抗美援朝运动更能普遍和深入。并且逐渐做到使首都每一个地方每一个妇女都能受到抗美援朝爱国教育。
    大会姊妹们，你们写给我的信，我很感动，感动得流了眼泪，我除了表示兴奋和感动以外，并且向全市的姊妹们致谢。祝你们在今后的生产中、工作中、学习中，完成你们的爱国公约；加强团结，和全市、和全国人在一块，坚决拥护缔结和平公约，坚决反对美国武装日本，努力做好抗美援朝工作和镇压反革命的工作，来保卫我们的祖国，保卫我们的好光景，保卫我们的孩子们。
              蔡畅  四月二十四日
