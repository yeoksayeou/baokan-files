    "Chicken Feather Letter" is a very satisfying comic strip. Engels once said, "Realism, apart from the faithfulness of detail, implies the truthful reproduction of typical characters under typical circumstances." ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels") "Chicken Feather Letter" possesses this merit.

    "Chicken Feather Letter" is about a rural children's corps leader who delivers letters for the guerrillas in the Anti-Japanese War, enabling the guerrillas to remove the enemy's stronghold. This story itself has universality. It does not rely on bizarre ideas beyond the real environment of society and life to attract children, like old Chinese martial arts novels and foreign detective novels. Such absurd fictions are of little benefit to the healthy development of children's minds; on the contrary, they easily lead to children's surreal meditations, preventing them from facing the things in life squarely. Currently, a large portion of comic strip reading materials are still absurd stories of foreign adventurers and Chinese knights-errant, which is a harmful phenomenon. The reasons for this, in addition to the lack of a serious and responsible work attitude on the part of the producers and publishers, are mainly due to the lack of basic artistic cultivation among many comic strip creators. They are not good at drawing rich materials from history and reality, nor are they good at refining these materials, so that many great and rich themes are neglected, or made into a stereotypical, "almost" type of work that lacks the artistic power to move readers. "Chicken Feather Letter" is a particularly worthy example of learning in terms of adopting the most universal themes and producing the most authentic and yet most narrative stories.

    The theme of "Chicken Feather Letter" is very typical. It expresses this highly combative story through a fourteen-year-old rural child, Haiwa. The direction of children is the real direction of the new China; the great quality of the Chinese people is given the highest typical expression when even children so resolutely devote themselves to the struggle. The producers did not use a single political narrative but completely and movingly depicted the noble political qualities, selfless national will, and class will of the children of new China through the reasonable development of the story. It also writes about how the Eighth Route Army relied on deep support rooted in the masses to conduct victorious battles against the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War. It does not exaggerate this brave teenager with individual heroism; it correctly attributes this teenager's struggle to a part of the entire struggle.

    The illustrator has handled Haiwa's facial contours very well. He depicts this teenager in the fierce struggle of blood and fire as so movingly tranquil and simple. The children of new China are precisely such children. They regard defending the motherland as their bounden duty, and fighting the enemy as their responsibility, wholeheartedly completing their sacred tasks in any difficult environment. Through the development of a very tense story, Haiwa's facial expressions have very reasonable changes, but he always expresses a firm and combative sense of responsibility. Haiwa in front of the enemy's army is not panicked, but always filled with calmness and self-confidence. At the same time, the illustrator did not exaggerate this heroic child as if he were an American little hooligan, nor did he express him as a "sword-browed and tiger-eyed" Chinese-style hero without emotion. Instead, he delved into the details of the story and the psychology of the characters, correctly expressing the pain, anxiety, difficulty, tension, and joy of the characters in the story, and from these emotional states, he consistently expressed the protagonist's simplicity and firmness. The scene of Haiwa being injured and unconscious is particularly touching.

    The wit and bravery of Haiwa shown by the producers is also very commendable. The entire story is divided into several climaxes, and each climax is actually a battle of wits. Only the brave who have been tempered in the combat environment and are full of confidence in the struggle can still calmly try to fool the enemy and defeat the enemy in every possible way before the enemy's bayonet. All this is expressed so naturally. The producers did not write the enemy as a fool; rather, they wrote them as very cunning - realistically cunning. Therefore, Haiwa's wit is not written as a superficial trick, but as wisdom that is good at using his identity (a fourteen-year-old shepherd boy), good at using the enemy's psychology, good at identifying the laws of struggle, and familiar with the terrain. Haiwa's clever fooling of the enemy is fully worthy of the reader's heartfelt approval. But the author writes about children, not adults. The author's success is due to his mastery of the true combat wisdom of the great Chinese children.

    The short story contains many dramatic and tense passages. If one of Haiwa's strategies fails, another strategy comes, and one after another, he finally sends the urgent "Chicken Feather Letter" to the troops and completes the task. The whole story has a very attractive power, meticulous and natural. This success should be due to the fact that the producer's thoughts and feelings are consistent with the thoughts and feelings in the story. Therefore, the producer can reasonably imagine Haiwa's experiences step by step, and imagine Haiwa's countermeasures step by step, so that this work achieves a successful result that is rich in changes and deeply moving.

    The picture configuration is also successful, and Haiwa is prominently displayed in each picture. The pictures closely focus on the typical characters and the theme. The illustrator never allowed secondary actions to obscure the main actions. The illustrator used all his strength to grasp the main actions, grasp the degree of story development in each picture, and closely link the pictures with the story development. For example, in the several pictures of Haiwa escaping from the enemy by herding sheep and climbing mountains, the movements and postures are different, but they can just conform to the development of the plot. Even his many drawings of the flock of sheep are filled with emotion, expressing the pastoral mood of the peasants.

    The image composition of the Eighth Route Army and guerrillas is also quite good, showing the sincerity, bravery, kindness, and seriousness of the people's soldiers.

    This is a work with great success in politics and art, and it is worth learning from for comic strip workers. Comrade Liu Jiyu's success in creation also sends a call to all art workers: such a mass art form as comic strips is worthy of high attention from all art workers. We have seen Comrade Liu Jiyu's original manuscript of "Chicken Feather Letter". The artistic depiction of fine grinding and meticulous carving should receive its due praise, and his work has indeed won the love of the masses. The road of comic strips is broad, and this broad road requires more art workers who serve the masses to enthusiastically and laboriously open it up, so that not only can more and better comic strips be produced, but these comic strips themselves are also monumental artworks that all art workers strive to pursue.

　　推荐刘继卣绘“鸡毛信”
    华山原作大众图书出版社出版上下两册

    “鸡毛信”是一部很令人满意的连环画。恩格斯曾经说过这样一句话：“现实主义除开详细情节的真实性以外，还要表现典型环境之中的典型的性格。”（引自“海上述林”）“鸡毛信”是具有这种优点的。
    “鸡毛信”是写一个农村儿童团团长，在抗日游击战争中替游击队送信，因而使游击队拔除敌人据点的故事。这个故事本身是具有普遍性的，它不象中国的旧武侠小说和外国的侦探小说一类小说那样，依赖超出社会和人生的真实环境以外的诡谲的构想来吸引儿童。那种荒谬的虚构对于儿童健全的心智的发展很少有益，倒很容易引起儿童的超现实的瞑想，不去正视生活中的事物。目前连环画读物中，还有很大一部分，都是这种外国冒险家和中国游侠的荒唐故事，这是一种有害的现象。它的原因，除了归之于制作者出版者还缺少严肃负责的工作态度外，主要的，是由于许多连环画制作者缺少基本的艺术修养，不善于从历史和现实中汲取丰富的素材，不善于洗炼这种素材，以至很多伟大丰富的题材被遗漏，或制造成一种八股式的、“差不多”型的，缺少感动读者的艺术力量的作品。“鸡毛信”在采用最大普遍性的题材，制作出最大真实性而又最大故事性这一方面，是一个特别值得学习的范例。
    “鸡毛信”的主题是十分典型的。它通过一个十四岁的农村儿童海娃来表现这个极富战斗性的故事，儿童的方向是真正新中国的方向；连儿童都如此坚决地投身于斗争，中国人民的伟大品质是得着最高的典型表现了。制作者没有用一句政治性叙述，完全通过故事的合情合理的发展，十二分动人地描绘了新中国儿童的高贵的政治品质，忘我的民族意志与阶级意志。它也写出了抗日战争中八路军如何依赖植根于群众中的深厚的支持，和敌人进行胜利的战斗。它没有对这个勇敢的少年作个人英雄主义的夸大，它正确地把这个少年的斗争归结为整个斗争的一部分。
    绘图者对于海娃的面部轮廓处理得十分好。他把这个在血与火的激烈斗争中的少年，描绘得那么感人地恬静、纯朴。新中国的儿童正是这样的儿童，它们把保卫祖国当作自己的天职，把和敌人搏斗当作自己的本分，心无二意地在任何艰苦环境下完成自己的神圣任务。通过十分紧张的故事的发展，海娃面部表情有十分合理的变化，但始终表现出了一种坚定的、战斗的责任心。在敌人军队面前的海娃，不是惊惶失措，而是始终不变地充满镇静和自信。同时，绘图者丝毫没有把这个英雄的儿童夸张得好象美国小流氓那样，也没有把它表现为毫无感情的“剑眉虎眼”的中国式英雄，而是深入故事的细节和人物的心理，正确表现了在故事中的人物的痛楚、焦急、困难、紧张和愉快等等感情，又从这些情绪状态中贯彻地表现出了主人翁的纯朴和坚定。海娃受伤昏迷时的画面，尤其使人感动。
    制作者表现出来的海娃的机智勇敢，也是十分值得赞扬的。整个故事分成几个高潮，每一高潮实际都是斗智。只有在战斗环境中锻炼出来，充满斗争自信的勇敢者，才能在敌人刺刀之前还能那样镇静地千方百计地设法愚弄敌人、战胜敌人。这一切又表现得那么自然。制作者并没有把敌人写得像笨伯，毋宁是把他们写得十分狡猾——合于真实的狡猾，因此，海娃的机智也就没有写成为浅薄的小伎俩，而是写成为善于利用自己的身份（十四岁的放羊儿童），善于利用敌人的心理，善于识别斗争规律，以及熟习地形的智慧。海娃对敌人的巧妙的愚弄，是充分足令读者会心地赞许的。但作者写的又确是儿童而不是成人。作者的成功是由于它掌握了伟大的中国儿童的真实的战斗智慧。
    在简短的故事中，包含了许多戏剧性的紧张的段落。海娃的一个智谋失败了，又来一个智谋，接二连三地终于把紧急的鸡毛信送到部队，完成了任务。整个故事具有十分吸引人的力量，细致而又自然。达到这一成功，应该是由于制作者的思想感情和故事中的思想感情取得一致的缘故，因此制作者能够合理地一步一步设想海娃的遭际，一步一步设想海娃的对策，于是就使这个作品得到富有变化、深刻动人的成功。
    画面配置也是成功的，在每幅画面中都突出地表现了海娃。画面十分紧密地扣住了典型人物，也扣住了主题，绘图者总没有让次要的动作掩饰了主要的动作。绘图者用全力抓住主要动作，掌握每幅画面的故事发展程度，使画面和故事发展密切联系起来。例如海娃逃开敌人赶羊爬山的几幅画面，动作姿态各不相同而又能恰恰符合情节的发展。甚至它对于羊群的许多幅绘图，也显得感情充溢，表现了农民的牧歌式的情调。
    对于八路军和游击队员的形象构图，也相当地好。表现了人民战士的真挚、勇敢、善良和严肃。
    这是一部在政治上、艺术上都有很大成功的作品，值得连环画工作者向它学习。刘继卣同志在创作上的成功也向一切美术工作者发出号召：对于连环画这样群众性的艺术形式是值得一切美术工作者付予高度重视的。我们曾经看了刘继卣同志制作“鸡毛信”的原稿，那细磨细琢的艺术的刻划应该得到它应有的推崇，而他的工作果然赢得了群众的爱戴。连环画的道路是广阔的，这广阔的道路需要更多的、为群众服务的美术工作者热情而费力地去开辟它，这样不但就可以产生更多的更好的连环画，而这些连环画本身也就是一切美术工作者所刻意追求的纪念碑式的艺术作品。
