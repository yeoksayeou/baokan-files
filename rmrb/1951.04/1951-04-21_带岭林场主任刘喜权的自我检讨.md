　　Self-Criticism of Liu Xiquan, Director of Dailing Forestry Farm

　　I sincerely accept the criticism of Dailing Forestry Farm made by comrades Lü Yunchang and two others, which was published in the People's Daily on March 7th.

　　The serious errors in my work in cleaning up the forestry farm have been clearly written in the report of the People's Supervision Committee of the Songjiang Provincial People's Government. This is because I did not seriously study the regulations for cleaning up the forestry farm when I took charge of this work, my management was not strict enough, and I did not promptly conduct in-depth inspections in my work. Secondly, it was because the technical guidance force was weak.

　　This mistake has given me a great lesson. In the future, I will definitely work hard, improve my professional level, and strive to be a model worker to make up for the losses in this work.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Dailing Forestry Farm  Liu Xiquan

　　带岭林场主任刘喜权的自我检讨
    人民日报三月七日登载吕运昌等三同志对带岭林场的批评，我诚恳接受。
    我在清理林场工作中的严重错误，松江省人民政府人民监察委员会的报告中已经写清楚了。这是因为我在掌握这一工作时，对清理林场的规定没有认真进行研究，在经营管理上不够严格，工作中更没有及时深入检查。其次，是因为技术指导力量较弱。
    这次错误给我一个很大的教训。今后我一定努力工作，提高业务水平，争取做个模范工作者，以弥补这次工作上的损失。
