    Unwilling to Admit Old Age
    By Guanjian
    (Sixteen) Old man Li ran fifteen *li* in one breath, and then ran back. The militiamen on guard in Dongcun were also very surprised to see it.
    (Seventeen) When Old Man Li ran back to the village, although he was a little out of breath, he didn't seem too tired. Everyone then understood what he meant and said, "Old man, you are really amazing!" Old Man Li said, "Will you let me go or not? If anyone is not convinced, let's have another competition!"
    (Eighteen) Old Man Li finally achieved his goal and joined the volunteer stretcher team; he crossed the Yalu River to rescue the brave Chinese and Korean warriors who were gloriously wounded while bravely fighting against American imperialism. (The End)

    不服老
    关键作
    （十六）李老头一口气跑了十五里地，又跑回去。东邨放哨的民兵，看了也觉得很奇怪。
    （十七）李老头跑回村来，虽然说有点发喘，可是并不显得太累。大家这才明白他的意思，都说：“老大爷真是了不起！”李老头说：“让不让我去？谁不服，咱们再比一比！”
    （十八）李老头终于达到了目的，参加了志愿担架队；跨过鸭绿江，去救护为英勇打击美帝国主义而光荣受伤的中朝勇士们。（完）
