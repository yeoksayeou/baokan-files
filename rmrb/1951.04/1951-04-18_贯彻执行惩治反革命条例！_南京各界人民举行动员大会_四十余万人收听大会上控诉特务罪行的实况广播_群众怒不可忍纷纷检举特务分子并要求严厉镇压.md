　　Implement the Regulations for Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries!
    Nanjing People from All Walks of Life Hold Mobilization Rally
    Over 400,000 People Listen to Live Broadcasts of Accusations of Special Agent Crimes at the Rally
    The Masses, Filled with Indignation, Expose Special Agents and Demand Severe Suppression

    The Nanjing Municipal People's Mobilization Rally to implement the Regulations for Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries was held on the 10th. Representatives of people from all walks of life (more than 3,000 people) attending the rally and the masses throughout the city listening to the live broadcast of the rally totaled more than 470,000, fully demonstrating the determination of the people of the city to suppress counter-revolutionaries.
    At the meeting, several women tearfully recounted the tragic facts of their husbands being murdered, buried alive, and burned to death by special agents, choked with sobs. After Tao Maoying's husband was killed, the special agents even wanted to "uproot the grass," forcing her to take her four children, hide in the east, hide in the west, and not even dare to walk on the main road. After Shao Baozhen's husband was buried alive, she wandered everywhere, living in ancient temples, eating wild vegetables, and her children also starved to death. Many citizens who had been persecuted indignantly accused the counter-revolutionary elements of their monstrous crimes. After Wang Hua Yu, representing the residents of the Sunning Factory, accused Gu Yuanxiang, a Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau and Military Statistics Bureau special agent, of his crimes, he immediately produced a letter of signature from 187 households in the Sunning Factory, demanding that the government eliminate the harm for the people. The letter wrote: "Such a counter-revolutionary element cannot be left alive; if he is left alive, the people will suffer." Yang Bingchen, a worker at the Jiangnan Automobile Company, representing all the employees of the factory, accused Wang Cuiqing, a Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau and Military Statistics Bureau special agent, of sabotaging production, saying: Wang secretly turned on the electrical switches in the car at night, burned the transformers, and damaged nine cars, causing the company to lose more than 2 billion yuan, and causing inconvenience to the city's transportation. Yang Bingchen, representing all the employees of the factory, demanded that this special agent be shot. Hu Zhengxu, the director of teaching at the School for the Blind and Deaf, accused Wu Xingya and Ye Binghua, who had been arrested by the People's Government and had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities in the school, and also exposed Liu Wensheng, a counter-revolutionary element who is still lurking in the school. Liu, wearing the guise of Christianity, carried out sabotage activities in the school, organized so-called "brothers" and "sisters of God," and other reactionary organizations, and raped Cai Yuqin, a 13-year-old blind girl. Hu Zhengxu said with great emotion: "I am a teacher at the school. Can I stand by and watch students with disabilities being coerced and raped by special agents!" The representatives present at the meeting listened to these tearful accusations, and all hated them to the bone, unanimously demanding that the government implement the Regulations for Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries. The entire venue constantly erupted in shouts of "Arrest Liu Wensheng!" and "Resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities." The director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately accepted the demands of the masses and announced that he would immediately call the Public Security Bureau to arrest Liu Wensheng. At this time, waves of applause and slogans erupted from the audience.
    While the meeting was filled with bloody accusations, more than 400,000 people throughout the city were listening to the live broadcast of the meeting. Before the start of the rally, although it was drizzling, citizens still gathered in groups, young and old, toward the listening locations. Patients lying in bed in the Gulou Hospital also requested to listen to the broadcast. Some merchants who were meeting to discuss business taxes in the Central and Jiankang shopping malls stopped their discussions and joined in listening after the rally began. In the winter defense first squadron resident listening group of Shuangtang Office, there was an old lady named Huang, whose son-in-law, Zhang Jiaxi, was arrested by American and Chiang special agents along with Chen Fengying's husband, who was making accusations at the meeting, and his whereabouts are still unknown. When Chen Fengying cried out about the special agents killing her husband, Old Lady Huang fainted on the ground from grief. All the residents were filled with indignation and unanimously demanded severe punishment for the counter-revolutionary criminals. In their uncontrollable anger, the citizens automatically exposed special agents. In just a few hours, the rally received 1,278 phone calls from the masses listening to the broadcast, demanding severe suppression of counter-revolutionaries and expressing condolences to the families of the victims; 7,128 letters, including 322 letters exposing special agents. Hang Changrong, a resident of No. 9 Hou Lane, Dengfu Lane, said: "Suppressing counter-revolutionaries is the people's own business, and everyone should work together to help the government eliminate counter-revolutionaries." At many listening locations, people spontaneously started accusation meetings and spoke out about the pain they had suffered from special agent persecution in the past. Some who were originally hesitant to speak out finally spoke out at the meeting.
    Mayor Ke Qingshi gave the final speech at the rally. When he announced to everyone that "we will definitely implement the Regulations for Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary elements," the applause at the venue lasted for a long time.

    南京各界人民举行动员大会
    四十余万人收听大会上控诉特务罪行的实况广播
    群众怒不可忍纷纷检举特务分子并要求严厉镇压
    【新华社南京十六日电】南京市各界人民贯彻执行惩治反革命条例动员大会于十日举行。出席大会的各界人民代表（三千多人）和全市各处收听大会实况广播的群众共达四十七万余人，充分表现了全市人民对于镇压反革命的决心。
    会上，好几位妇女控诉了丈夫被特务分子杀害、活埋、烧死的悲痛事实，泣不成声。陶茂英的丈夫被害后，特务还要“斩草除根”，逼得她带着四个孩子，东躲西藏，连大路也不敢走。邵宝箴的丈夫被活埋后，她到处流浪，住古庙，吃野菜，孩子也饿死了。许多曾遭受迫害的市民激愤地控诉了反革命分子的滔天罪行。汪华余代表晒布厂居民控诉国民党中统、军统特务匪徒顾元象的罪恶事实后，当即拿出晒布厂一百八十七户居民的签名书，要求政府为民除害。该信写道：“这样的反革命分子不能留，留了他人民就遭殃。”江南汽车公司工人杨炳臣代表该厂全体职工控诉国民党中统、军统特务王萃卿破坏生产的罪行说：王匪常在夜间偷偷地把汽车内的电开关开开，烧毁变压器，破坏了九部汽车，使公司损失二十多亿元，市民交通不便。杨炳臣代表全厂职工要求枪毙这个特务分子。盲哑学校教导主任胡征序控诉了已被人民政府逮捕的、曾在该校进行反革命活动的吴醒亚和叶炳华的罪行，同时检举了现在还潜藏在该校的反革命分子刘文盛。刘匪披着基督教的外衣在该校进行破坏活动，组织所谓“师兄弟”、“神烧姐妹”等反动组织，并强奸了十三岁的女盲生蔡玉琴。胡征序激动万分地说：“我是学校的老师，我能眼看着五官不全的学生们被特务胁迫和奸污而不管吗！”到会代表听了这些一字一泪的控诉，无不切齿痛恨，一致要求政府贯彻执行惩治反革命条例，全场并不断地发出了“逮捕刘文盛！”“坚决镇压反革命活动”的吼声。市公安局长当场接受群众的要求，宣布立即打电话给公安局将刘文盛逮捕起来。这时，台下又响起了狂风巨浪似的掌声和口号声。
    当会场内进行着血泪控诉的时候，全市各处共有四十多万人在收听会场的实况广播。大会开始前，虽然落着蒙蒙细雨，但市民们仍扶老携幼成群结队地向各收听处汇集。鼓楼医院中躺在病床上的病人也要求听广播。中央、建康等商场内正在开会评议营业税的一部分商人，当大会开始后，即停止评议，参加收听。双塘所冬防第一中队居民收听小组内有位黄老太太，她的女婿张家熙是和在会场内进行控诉的陈凤英的丈夫一起被美蒋特务抓去的，至今下落不知。当陈凤英哭诉特务杀死她的丈夫时，黄老太太竟痛哭得晕倒在地上。全场居民无不愤慨难遏，一致要求严惩反革命罪犯。市民群众在怒不可忍中纷纷自动检举特务分子。大会在短短的几小时内，接到收听广播的群众的电话达一千二百七十八次，要求严厉镇压反革命和向被害人家属慰问；信函达七千一百二十八件，其中检举特务的信有三百二十二件。邓府巷后九号居民杭长荣说：“镇压反革命是人民自己的事，大家要一齐来协助政府肃清反革命。”有许多收听处，参加收听的人临时自动开起控诉会来，说出自己过去遭受特务迫害的痛苦。有的原来还有顾虑不敢说的，也终于在会上控诉起来。
    柯庆施市长最后在大会讲话。当他向大家宣布“一定贯彻地执行惩治反革命条例，坚决镇压反革命分子”的时候，会场上掌声经久不息。
