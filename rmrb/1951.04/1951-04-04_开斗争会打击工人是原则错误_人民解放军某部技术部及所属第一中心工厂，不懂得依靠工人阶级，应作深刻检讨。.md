Holding struggle sessions to attack workers is a fundamental error.
    The Technology Department of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army and its subordinate First Central Factory do not understand how to rely on the working class and should conduct a thorough self-criticism.
Editor:
    Certain administrative leading cadres of the Technology Department of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army and its subordinate First Central Factory have failed to promptly and reasonably resolve the welfare problems of the workers. Instead of persuading and educating the workers with a caring attitude regarding their concerns and anxieties arising from unstable work, abnormal production, and unreasonable welfare, they mistakenly used struggle sessions to "review work," resulting in a serious blow to the workers' morale. Such erroneous behavior, detached from the working class, warrants a profound self-criticism.
    The matter began as follows: Last November, the Central Factory of the said unit received a group of workers from a certain railway factory. At that time, it was announced to the employees that all welfare benefits originally enjoyed on the railway, except for the twelve annual free train tickets, would remain unchanged, without any cancellation or reduction. Shortly thereafter, the workers saw that the railway department had issued cotton-padded clothing, winter welfare coal, year-end double pay, and year-end attendance bonuses to its employees, but the Central Factory had not issued these (reportedly because the higher authorities had not approved them). The workers were very dissatisfied with this. Because the original welfare problems could not be resolved, the factory once agreed with the Ministry of Railways to assign a portion of the railway factory workers to work in the Railway Engineering Corps. However, this plan was not realized because the workers were unwilling to leave the factory and their hometowns. At that time, the situation was as follows: the workplace was not determined, there was not much work to do in the factory, everything was chaotic, and the welfare problems were not resolved. Therefore, the workers' production morale was greatly reduced, and some individual workers did not abide by labor discipline.
    The heads of the Central Factory and the Technology Department did not delve into the workers' thoughts and demands, patiently persuade and educate them, stabilize their morale, and actively find ways to solve the workers' welfare problems. Instead, they believed that the workers' thinking was backward and that they were being manipulated and exploited by a few bad elements. Without consulting the factory's trade union, the Technology Department decided to suspend production and conduct a review of work. The so-called review of work was to solicit opinions from Mu Chunyang, the former director of the railway factory (then serving as the chief of the preparation section of the Central Factory), and Fang Zhen, the chairman of the trade union. Mu and Fang's shortcomings were mainly that their style of work was not democratic enough, their work methods were limited, and they were guilty of commandism; but they were essentially decent worker-born Party cadres. At the work review meeting, as soon as Mu began to make a self-criticism, Deputy Director Wang Zhiyi (sent by the Technology Department of a certain unit to assist in the work review) taught Platoon Leader Chu Zhixin (a portion of the factory's military personnel had transferred to production, and the original organization remained unchanged) to lead the workers in shouting slogans such as "Welcome frankness, welcome progress." Midway, Platoon Leader Chu led the workers in shouting: "Mu Chunyang, too dictatorial, oppressing workers is wrong. Mu Chunyang, be frank, only self-renewal can lead to a way out..." When Mu said in his self-criticism: "I myself am from a worker background and have never done leadership work before, so I have many shortcomings," Deputy Director Wang believed that Mu was not honest, stopped his speech midway, pulled him off the stage, and scolded him as a bad guy. He also said: "Let's be frank, the work review should start with the leaders, which means reviewing you, administrative Mu Chunyang, reviewing you, trade union Fang Zhen (trade union chairman), and a few bad eggs. Fang Zhen, what did you report when you went to the railway factory and the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions several times? What problems did you solve? Didn't you just have to come back to the factory? What's so great about being the chairman of the trade union!" In the middle of the speech, there were derogatory remarks about the trade union.
    At this time, Liu Zhi, a worker who had previously held prejudices against Mu Chunyang, opened his mouth and cursed Mu as a bastard. Another worker named Qiu Jiexun stood up and slapped Mu in the face. Mu Chunyang suffered this shock, became mentally disturbed, and was bedridden for ten days.
    After Mu fell ill, Trade Union Chairman Fang Zhen continued to make a self-criticism. After one self-criticism, it was said that it was not profound enough, and he made a second self-criticism. Fang cried on stage, and some workers cried with him. Deputy Director Wang wrote eleven points of an outline and handed them over to Fang for reflection.
    Afterward, Deputy Director Wang personally took charge of liquidating the trade union's membership dues, cultural and educational fees, and mutual aid society fees. At the work review panel meeting, the masses offered very few opinions to Fang. Wang said that the trade union had henchmen suppressing workers from speaking out and that the trade union's henchmen should also be reviewed. In total, the work review lasted for thirteen days.
    After this kind of work review, the workers became even more afraid of the administration and dared not speak out. Workers said behind their backs: "This is targeting us workers. It's so scary, like being interrogated." After the trade union suffered this blow, cadres were unwilling to engage in trade union work. The masses were also afraid of approaching trade union cadres, fearing being falsely accused of being "trade union henchmen."
    The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions reported the situation to the leading organs. The instructions received at the time were: the original welfare benefits of the workers should remain unchanged and should be issued as usual; democratic management should be implemented in the factory, etc. In mid-January, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, and the political department of a certain unit jointly formed a work team to assist in handling this matter at the factory. After in-depth understanding and explanation among the workers, and discussions with the factory's leading cadres, the factory issued double pay, bonuses, and welfare coal to the workers in late January. The work style of some administrative management cadres in the factory also began to change, and the factory's trade union also began to actively carry out its work. The workers' production morale also gradually improved. The production volume in February increased by more than double compared to January, the quality also greatly improved, and materials were saved, and costs were reduced. The surprise task in early March was also completed two days ahead of schedule. These facts fully demonstrate that the factory workers are by no means backward.
    However, the Technology Department, especially Section Chief Li Feng of the Repair Section and Deputy Director Wang Zhiyi, still cannot recognize the errors of the past "work review" methods. When the work team pointed out the lack of a working-class reliance in the factory's administrative leadership, and the inappropriate "work review" methods, Repair Section Chief Li and Deputy Director Wang countered by explaining that the "work review" which had formed struggle sessions in the past, was in actuality a "centralized study for workers". Deputy Director Wang even said, "It is regrettable that the work review was not continued."
    Recently, the State Council promulgated the Labor Insurance Regulations, and Section Chief Li intended to abolish all of the workers' original welfare benefits after paying the labor insurance premiums. Political Commissar Zhang Yaoyan of the factory insisted on disagreeing with his opinion, and Li believed that Zhang was accommodating the workers. To date, the factory has not actively resolved issues such as medical care and hospitalization in the workers' original welfare benefits.
    In addition, for the five months since the factory was established, it has not allocated trade union funds to the trade union. Although the trade union has repeatedly made requests to the administration, according to Political Commissar Zhang Yaoyan, they have also repeatedly requested instructions and reported to higher authorities, but it has not been approved so far.
    The work team reported these issues to the leading organs of the Technology Department and other relevant leading organs as early as mid-February, but no resolution has been seen to date. Therefore, I am specifically raising this matter with the Party newspaper. It is hoped that the Technology Department can conduct a self-criticism of the errors in the work review, and attach importance to and appropriately resolve issues related to worker welfare.
                                      Dīng Shān March 28th
    Editor's Note: Certain administrative leading cadres of the Technology Department of a certain unit and its subordinate First Central Factory are completely wrong to adopt struggle session methods to deal with problems among workers. This is a serious act of abandoning the working-class stance.
    The People's Liberation Army led by the Communist Party of China has always fought and shed blood for the liberation of the working class and all the people. However, why does such a serious phenomenon of detachment from the working masses still exist in military system enterprises like the one described in this article?
    The main reason is that some administrative cadres who have transferred from the army to enterprises have not seriously studied the instructions of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party on relying on the working class. Instead of learning from the workers and relying on the working class to manage the enterprise, they use militaristic management methods to run the enterprise and treat the workers. Such an erroneous work style will inevitably lead to serious mistakes. Therefore, we hope that these comrades will openly criticize and resolutely correct their mistakes, establish the idea of relying on the working class, humbly listen to the opinions of the workers, rely on the workers' organizations, and implement genuine democratic management.

　　开斗争会打击工人是原则错误        
    人民解放军某部技术部及所属第一中心工厂，不懂得依靠工人阶级，应作深刻检讨。编辑同志：
    人民解放军某部技术部及所属第一中心工厂某些行政领导干部，不能及时合理地解决工人的福利问题，对工人因工作不安定、生产不正常、福利得不到合理解决而产生的顾虑和不安现象，不是以爱护和关心的态度进行说服教育，而是错误地以斗争会的方式来“检查工作”，结果，严重地打击了工人的情绪。这种错误的脱离工人阶级的行为，值得深刻检讨。
    事情的起因是这样的：去年十一月，该部中心工厂自某铁路工厂接收一部分工人，当时曾向职工宣布：原在铁路上所有福利，除每年的十二张免费乘车票外，一律照旧，概不取消或减低。此后不久，工人见铁路部门给职工发了棉衣、冬季福利煤、年终双薪及年终考勤奖金等，但中心工厂却没发给（据说是上级未批准），工人对此事很不满。因原有福利问题不得解决，厂方曾一度和铁道部商妥，将铁路工厂一部分工人，分发到铁道兵团工作。但因工人不愿离开工厂及家乡，这个计划没有实现。当时的情况是：工作处所未确定，厂内又没多少活干，一切都很乱，福利问题又没有解决，因此工人生产情绪大为低落，并有个别工人不遵守劳动纪律。
    中心工厂及技术部的负责人，不去深入了解工人的思想情况与要求，耐心地进行说服教育，安定工人的情绪，并积极设法解决工人的福利问题，反而认为工人思想落后，认为工人是被少数坏分子操纵利用。未与厂内工会商量，即由技术部决定停止生产，进行检查工作。所谓检查工作，就是对原铁路工厂厂主任穆春阳（当时任中心工厂制备科科长）及工会主席方珍提意见。穆、方的缺点主要是作风不够民主，工作办法较少，并犯有命令主义等毛病；但他们基本上还是正派的工人出身的党员干部。在检查工作大会上，穆一开始检讨，王志毅副处长（由某部技术部派至该厂协助检查工作的）便教初志新排长（该厂有一部分军人转入生产，原编制未变。）领导工人喊：“欢迎坦白，欢迎进步”等口号。中途初排长又领导工人喊：“穆春阳，太独裁，压迫工人不应该。穆春阳，快坦白，只有自新，才有出路……。”穆在检讨时说：“我自己是工人出身，过去没作过领导工作，所以有很多缺点。”王副处长认为穆不老实，中途制止了他的发言，把他拉下台来，并骂他是坏家伙。又说：“打开天窗说亮话，检查工作，先从领导开始，就是要检查你行政穆春阳，检查你工会方珍（工会主席）及少数几个坏蛋。方珍你好几次去铁路工厂，去北京市总工会，报告些什么？你解决了些什么问题？还不是要回厂来。你工会主席有什么了不起！”说话中间，并有污辱工会的言词。
    这时，有一个过去对穆春阳抱成见的工人刘志，开口骂穆是混蛋。另一个叫邱洁勋的，起来打了穆一个耳光，穆春阳受了这个刺激，神经失常，卧病十来天。
    穆病后，继续由工会主席方珍检讨。检讨了一次说不深刻，又检讨第二次。方在台上哭起来了，一部分工人也跟着哭。王副处长写了十一条提纲，交方进行反省。
    以后，王副处长亲自动手清算工会的会费、文教费及互助会会费。在检查工作的小组会上，群众给方提的意见很少。王就说工会有爪牙在压制工人发言，还要检查工会的爪牙。总计检查工作进行了十三天。
    这样检查工作以后，工人对行政上更加害怕和不敢说话了。工人背后说：“这是整我们工人的。真可怕，好像过堂一样。”工会受到这种打击后，干部不愿搞工会工作了。群众也害怕与工会干部接近，怕被诬为“工会的爪牙”。
    北京市总工会把情况反映到领导机关，当时得到的指示是：工人原有福利不动，应予照发；在工厂中应实行民主管理等。元月中旬，由中华全国总工会、中共北京市委会、北京市总工会及某部政治部派出干部，共同组成了一个工作组，至该厂协助处理此事。经过在工人群众中深入了解，进行解释，又和该厂领导干部商讨后，至元月下旬，该厂给工人发了双薪、奖金及福利煤。厂内某些行政管理干部作风也开始转变，厂内工会亦开始积极进行工作。工人生产情绪也逐渐提高。二月份生产量较一月份增加一倍多，质量也大大提高，并节省了材料，减低了成本。三月上旬的突击任务，也提前两天完成。这些事实，充分说明该厂工人决不是落后的。
    但是，技术部、尤其是修理处黎枫处长及王志毅副处长，至今还不能认识过去的那种“检查工作”方式的错误。当工作组提出该厂行政领导干部在工作中缺乏依靠工人阶级的思想及“检查工作”的方式不当时，修理处黎处长及王副处长反把过去曾经形成了斗争会的“检查工作”解释成“集中工人学习”。王副处长还说：“遗憾的是，检查工作没有继续进行下去。”
    最近政务院公布了劳动保险条例，黎处长便打算在缴纳劳动保险金后，把工人原有的各项福利全部取消。该厂政治委员张耀颜坚持不同意他的意见，黎就认为张是迁就工人。至今，该厂对工人原有福利中的看病、住医院等问题尚未积极解决。
    此外，该厂成立五个月来，一直未向工会拨交工会经费。虽然工会已一再向行政提出，据张耀颜政委谈，他们也已一再向上级请示报告，迄未被批准。
    工作组早在二月中旬，便把这些问题报告给该技术部的领导机关，及其他有关领导机关，但至今未见解决。因此，我特向党报提出。希望该技术部能将检查工作的错误，进行检讨；并重视与适当解决有关工人福利的问题。
                                      丁山  三月二十八日
    编者按：某部技术部及所属第一中心工厂某些行政领导干部，采用斗争会的方式来处理工人中的问题，是完全错误的。这是失掉工人阶级立场的严重行为。
    中国共产党所领导的人民解放军，一直是为工人阶级与全体人民的解放而流血斗争的。但是，为什么在象本文所述的这种军事系统的企业中，还存在着这种严重地脱离工人群众的现象呢？
    这主要的原因是：某些由军队转入企业的行政干部没有认真学习党中央二中全会所规定的依靠工人阶级的指示。他们不去向工人学习，依靠工人阶级管理企业，反而用军阀主义的管理方法来搞企业，来对待工人，这样的错误作风，就必不可免地要犯严重的错误。因此我们希望这些同志公开检讨并坚决改正自己的错误，树立依靠工人阶级的思想，虚心地倾听工人的意见，依靠工人的组织，实行真正的民主管理。
