　  Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Forms a Mass Movement
    [Our Newspaper] A large-scale campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries is gradually unfolding in small and medium-sized counties and cities and vast rural areas across the country.

    Recently, various places in North China have held accusation meetings to denounce the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements. The accusation meeting held in Shahe County, Hebei, on March 10 was attended by more than 10,000 people from seventeen villages. Granny Sun from Sun Village, leaning on crutches, traveled eighty miles to the venue, asking the government to avenge her son. She said, "If these counter-revolutionaries are not suppressed, good people will not be able to live." When Yi County publicly tried the "Party Transformation Grandmaster" counter-revolutionary case, about 27,000 people from the vicinity attended the meeting. On April 1st and 2nd, Changli County held accusation, public trial, grievance, and revenge meetings in Nanguan Square and Jing'an Town, respectively. More than 20,000 people at the meetings applauded the suppression of counter-revolutionary elements. Zhuoxian, Cangxian, Guantao, Ningjin, Wanping, and other counties have recently held mass accusation meetings. Many rural areas have used rooftop broadcasts, street cartoons, slogans, and door-to-door explanations and other publicity methods to mobilize the people to fight against counter-revolutionary elements.

    In Jun County, Pingyuan Province, people from all walks of life actively accused and reported counter-revolutionary elements. At mass public trial meetings in places such as Nanguan, Xiaoheji in the Second District, Zhuangji in the Third District, Tunziji in the Fifth District, and Shantangji in the Seventh District of the county, the victims' tearful accusations aroused the hatred of the attendees for the counter-revolutionary elements, and they unanimously demanded that the government immediately execute the counter-revolutionary criminals. On March 15, Qinyang County held a mass public trial and accusation meeting. After the crimes of secret agent recidivists Wang Guoying and Zhang Chunpo, who murdered more than 600 people, were revealed, more and more people came to accuse them. Through the education of mass accusation and public trial meetings of counter-revolutionary elements, the people's political awareness is rapidly increasing. From March 15 to 26, the Jun County People's Government received 220 letters of accusation and denunciation from the masses in ten days. Liuhou Village in Yuanyang County, Xinxiang Prefecture, is a small village with more than 100 households. Recently, when a counter-revolutionary criminal fled through the village, more than 300 men and women in the village, armed with wooden forks and kitchen knives, chased him and found him in a cellar. Since March 13, Anyang County has held symposiums, publicity meetings, and accusation meetings in districts and streets, and conducted in-depth publicity visits to expose the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements. From March 17 to 30 alone, more than 30 large and small accusation meetings were held, with more than 100,000 people participating.

    In mid-March, Jining County, Suiyuan Province, held a meeting of peasant representatives. The representatives denounced 105 bandits and secret agents on the spot, and there were more than 40 cases of individual secret reports and denunciations. One-third of the counter-revolutionary criminals captured in Gui Sui County were automatically searched and sent to the government by the masses.

    The masses in Sarachi County captured a total of 90 bandit leaders. After a representative who participated in the provincial peasant representative meeting in Tokto County returned to his village, he mobilized the masses to capture 28 habitual bandits.

    In Linfen County, Shanxi Province, when arch-criminals like secret agents and despots Jia Xuding, Wang Zhengang, and Wang Jinlu were executed, more than 20,000 people came from afar to participate in the suffering and public trials. Yuncheng, Xiangling, Yuci, Tunliu, and other counties have held accusation meetings to suppress counter-revolutionaries. The masses were extremely excited and unanimously responded: This way, they can produce with peace of mind.

    Small and medium-sized cities and rural areas in East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest China are also gradually launching campaigns to suppress counter-revolutionaries. In the East China region, Pingyang and other counties in Zhejiang Province held accusation meetings of more than 20,000 people. In the Central South region, Yancheng and Shanxian Counties in Henan Province, Liuzhou, Longsheng, Ziyuan, Xing'an, and Lingui Counties in Guangxi Province, and Zhanjiang and Enping Counties in Guangdong Province have held mass accusation or public trial meetings. Some places executed counter-revolutionary elements on the spot and held demonstrations in support of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries after the meetings. At a meeting of more than 5,000 farmers in the Second District of Zhongshan County accusing counter-revolutionary elements, the farmers unanimously proposed: Guarantee to dig out all of Chiang [Kai-shek]'s roots and catch all the secret agents. In the Southwest region, more than 10,000 farmers in Wangfu Township, Fuling County, East Sichuan, accused the crimes of despots and secret agents on March 24. In the Northwest region, Liangyang Town in Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, and Xining City in Qinghai Province also held public trial meetings of counter-revolutionary elements.

    Although the large-scale campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries has gradually unfolded in many cities and rural areas, many regions are still hesitant and dare not boldly mobilize the masses. In order to do a good job in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, all localities should further mobilize the masses to assist the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

　　全国各地许多县市及广大农村
　  镇压反革命形成群众性运动
    【本报讯】大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动，在全国各地中小县、市和广大农村中逐步开展。
    华北各地最近纷纷举行控诉会，控诉反革命分子的罪行。河北沙河县三月十日召开的控诉大会，有十七个村的万余群众赶来参加。孙庄村的孙老大娘扶着拐杖从八十里外赶到会场，要求政府替她的儿子报仇。她说：“对这些反革命，要再不镇压，好人就没法过活了。”易县公审“化党大国”反革命案时，附近来参加大会的群众就有二万七千人。昌黎县四月一、二日两天，先后在南关广场和靖安镇召开控诉公审伸冤报仇大会。会上二万多群众对镇压反革命分子莫不拍手称快。涿县、沧县、馆陶、宁晋、宛平等县，最近都召开了群众控诉大会。许多农村并用屋顶广播、街头漫画、标语和挨户讲解种种宣传方式，动员人民向反革命分子进行斗争。
    平原省浚县各界人民积极控诉和检举反革命分子。在该县南关、二区小河集、三区庄集、五区屯子集、七区善堂集等地的群众公审大会上，被害人一字一泪的控诉，引起了到会群众对反革命分子的切齿痛恨，一致要求政府立即枪毙反革命罪犯。三月十五日，沁阳县召开了群众公审控诉大会，当特务惯匪王国英、张春坡二人杀害六百余人的罪行被揭发后，控诉的人越来越多。各地人民经过了控诉和公审反革命分子大会的教育，政治觉悟正迅速提高。浚县人民政府于三月十五日至二十六日十天中，收到群众的检举和控诉信达二百二十件。新乡专区原阳县刘后村是一个一百多户的小村庄，最近一个反革命罪犯潜逃经过该村时，全村三百多男女，手持木杈、菜刀追上，从地窖中将该犯搜出。安阳县自三月十三日起，以区、街为单位召开座谈会、宣传会与控诉会，并深入各户宣传访问，揭露反革命分子的罪行。仅从三月十七日到三十日就举行了大小控诉会三十余次，参加控诉会的群众达十余万人。
    绥远省集宁县于三月中旬召开了农民代表会议，当场代表们检举了一百零五名土匪、特务，个别密报检举的案件有四十多起。归绥县捕获的反革命罪犯中，三分之一是群众自动搜捉送交政府的。
    萨拉齐县群众共捕获匪首达九十人。托克托县一个参加省农民代表会的代表回村后，发动群众捕获了惯匪二十八名。
    山西省临汾县在枪毙贾徐丁、王振刚、王金禄等罪恶滔天的特务、恶霸时，二万多人远道赶来参加诉苦和公审。运城、襄陵、榆次、屯留县等地都举行过镇压反革命的控诉大会，群众极为振奋，一致反应：这样他们就能安心生产了。
    华东、中南、西南和西北各地的中小城市和农村也正在陆续展开镇压反革命运动。华东区的浙江省平阳等县都召开了两万多人的控诉大会。中南区河南省的郾城、陕县，广西省的柳州、龙胜、资源、兴安、临桂，广东省的湛江、恩平等县市，都纷纷召开了群众控诉或公审大会。有些地方并当场处决反革命分子，和在会后举行了拥护镇压反革命的示威游行。在中山县二区五千多农民控诉反革命分子的大会上，农民一致提出：保证挖尽蒋根，捉尽特务。西南区川东涪陵县望涪乡万余农民于三月二十四日控诉恶霸、特务的罪行。西北区陕西省临潼县梁阳镇、青海省西宁市也分别召开了公审反革命分子的大会。
    大张旗鼓镇压反革命运动，虽已在各地许多城市与农村中逐步展开，很多地区仍表现缩手缩脚，不敢大胆放手发动群众。为了作好镇压反革命工作，各地应更进一步地把群众发动起来，协助政府镇压反革命。
