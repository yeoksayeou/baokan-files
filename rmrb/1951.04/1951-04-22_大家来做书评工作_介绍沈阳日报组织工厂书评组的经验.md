Let Everyone Do Book Review Work
    ——Introducing the Experience of the Shenyang Daily in Organizing Factory Book Review Groups
    In the past month, the Shenyang Daily has published two book reviews written by factory book review groups, reviewing two popular readings: *The Economic Crisis in the United States* by Pi Zhi, published by the Northeast People's Publishing House, and *The Korean People in Battle* by Cao Tian. These two book reviews are very significant for mobilizing everyone to do book review work.
    The Shenyang Daily has published some book reviews in the past, but they did not have much impact on readers. The readers' feedback was "book reviews are not very useful." Therefore, they adopted the method of "organizing readers to form book review groups" in order to "bring books to the masses through book review groups, read to the masses, and then collect the opinions of the masses." First, they promoted the establishment of a book review group consisting of more than 20 union cultural and educational committee members, reading group leaders, and propagandists in factories, so that they could "carry out propaganda work by reading new books, and at the same time, collect readers' opinions and report them to the newspaper." The above two book reviews are the result of the collective work of such mass-based book review groups.
    *The Economic Crisis in the United States* is a popular theoretical reading. Facts have proved that workers need such readings. After this book was read in factory reading groups and on small-scale broadcasts, and discussed in some study groups, some workers reflected: "I was wondering why American imperialism, since it has no way out of aggression, doesn't just close the door and build itself up well. It turns out that it has an incurable dirty disease." In this way, good popular theoretical books solved their doubts and improved their level of understanding. At the same time, the book review group also pointed out some places in the book that "workers don't understand and are not deeply impressed after reading," and put forward improvement methods based on their experience. For example, the book cited many figures to illustrate the situation of the economic crisis in the United States, but "it is indeed very difficult for worker readers to read. Some workers said: 'The numbers make people dizzy!' Some workers understood it originally, but became confused because there were too many numbers listed. Everyone's opinion is: the numbers still need to be written, but they should be written more vividly." The workers put forward clear opinions on the issue of popularization: "Our worker brothers urgently need to know a lot of basic revolutionary knowledge. However, what we mean by popular is not only popular in language, but also that the道理 (dàolǐ - principle/reason) is explained in a popular way, the closer it is to the workers' thoughts, the easier it is to understand, and the easier it is to accept."
    The book review group believes that *The Korean People in Battle* is "a book suitable for reading and listening," and that "the content is very popular. Workers with a little over two years of education can understand it, and the masses can also understand it." But the book review group also pointed out: "When compiling popular readings, the story, characters, place, and time must be clearly explained. All the comrades in the book review group encountered the same problem when reading this book or reading it to the workers, that is, the explanation was not clear enough and the sense of reality was not enough." And suggested: "First, the author should appropriately literaryize it as much as possible based on the material. Especially when writing about the deeds of heroic figures, it is best to write about their thoughts and feelings. When this book is told to the workers, just reading the original text is not very motivating. The speaker must be good at appropriately rendering it based on the material, so that it can be motivating. Second, if a few illustrations can be drawn on this type of booklet, it will be more effective and leave a deeper impression."
    The above are the two book reviews published by the Shenyang Daily. The newspaper said in an article entitled "Our Book Review Group" that they have also organized the reading and review of some other books, and "are preparing to expand the scope after gaining experience." This work is meaningful and can be tried.
    In the "Instructions on Establishing Book and Newspaper Review Work in All National Newspapers and Periodicals," the News Publication Administration and the Publication Administration require that "all kinds of newspapers across the country...should establish book and newspaper review work according to specific needs and possibilities." Small-scale popular newspapers are no exception, and introducing and recommending popular readings is an important task of these newspapers. At present, the popularization of newspaper and publication work is a serious problem. On the one hand, newspapers and publications are held in the hands of a small number of people. On the other hand, the vast number of workers, peasants, and grassroots cadres lack readings that meet their needs. In order to improve and develop popular readings, one of the most important tasks is to conduct the evaluation of popular readings, and to trial-read these readings among the masses in order to gain experience and strive for improvement. At present, some local popular readings have been published in various places. These readings should become the most important object of book review work for local popular newspapers. It is the political task of newspapers to cooperate with the staff of relevant agencies and organizations to organize workers and peasants to read and comment on this popular reading.
    The preliminary experience of the Shenyang Daily proves that it is possible to organize everyone to do book review work, and that some gains have already been made. Because the factory book review group reads popular readings to workers in reading groups and small-scale wired broadcasts, it directly brings books to worker readers, helps worker education, and at the same time, the opinions of workers on popular readings are specifically and centrally reflected in the newspaper, which can directly benefit the work of popularization and give direct education to the authors of popular readings. After the Shenyang Daily published a review of *The Economic Crisis in the United States*, the author of the book immediately wrote to the newspaper, saying that this review "is of great help to both readers and authors." Authors of popular readings who are responsible to readers certainly respect the opinions of workers and peasants and are willing to regard their opinions as the guidelines for improving the writing of popular readings. At the same time, the publication of such book reviews in the newspapers truly plays the role of introduction and promotion. According to a survey by the Shenyang Daily, after the newspaper reviewed *The Economic Crisis in the United States*, the book's "readership has greatly increased, and many Shenyang citizens have gone to the library to specifically borrow this book to read." Therefore, the newspaper has played its due role in guiding the popularization of books and periodicals and promoting the mass reading movement.
    Having everyone do book review work is a very effective method for evaluating popularization readings. Other general books and periodicals, and even specialized books and periodicals, can also adopt this method to organize various study groups, students, education and research institutions, etc., to put forward individual or common opinions on books and periodicals, and mobilize everyone to do book review work.

　　大家来做书评工作
    ——介绍沈阳日报组织工厂书评组的经验
    沈阳日报在过去一个月中发表了两篇由工厂书评组执笔的书评，评介两本通俗读物：东北人民出版社出版，丕之著《美国的经济危机》和曹田著《战斗中的朝鲜人民》。这两篇书评对于发动大家来做书评工作很有意义。
    沈阳日报过去也发表过一些书评，但在读者中影响不大，读者的反映是“书评没啥作用”。于是他们采取了“把读者组织起来成立书评组”的办法，以便“通过书评组，把书籍带到群众中去，读给群众听，再把群众意见搜集上来”。首先推动工厂中的积极通讯员成立了包括二十余名工会文教委员、读报组长和宣传员的书评组，由他们“通过阅读新书进行宣传工作，同时，搜集读者意见，汇报给报社”。以上两篇书评就是由这样的群众性的书评组集体工作的成果。
    《美国的经济危机》是一本通俗的理论性读物。事实证明工人们是需要这种读物的。当这本书在工厂读报小组和小型广播上读了，并在有的学习小组中讨论了之后，有的工人反映：“我还寻思美帝国主义侵略既然没啥出路，为啥不关着门好好建设，原来他有个没法治的肮脏病。”这样，好的通俗理论书籍就解决了他们的疑惑，提高了他们的认识水平。同时，书评组也指出了本书的一些“工友们还不懂，看完以后印象还不深”的地方，并根据他们的经验提出了改进办法。例如书中引用了许多数字来说明美国经济危机的情形，但“在工人读者读起来，确有很多困难。有的工友说：‘数字把人家听昏了！’有的工友本来听得还明白，但是，因为列举数字太多，反倒弄得糊涂起来。大家的意思是：数字还是要写，可是要写的形象一些。”工人们对通俗化问题提出了明确的意见：“我们工人兄弟们迫切需要知道许多基本的革命知识。不过，我们所说的通俗，不仅是语言上的通俗，而是道理讲得通俗、愈接近工友的思想愈易懂，也愈易接受。”
    书评组认为“战斗中的朝鲜人民”是“适合读听的一本书”，“内容很通俗，稍有两年文化的工人就能看得懂，群众也听得懂。”但书评组又指出：“编写通俗读物，故事、人物、地点、时间一定要交待清楚。所有书评组同志在读这本书、或念给工友听时，都发生了一个同样的问题，就是交待不够清楚，真实感不够。”并建议：“一，作者应尽可能地根据材料予以适当的文艺化。尤其写英雄人物的事迹，最好能写出他的思想感情。本书讲给工友听，光读原文，鼓动性不大，必须讲者善于根据材料适当地渲染，鼓动性才能大。二，这一类小册子，如果能画上几幅插画，作用就会更大，印象也更深。”
    以上是沈阳日报发表了的两篇书评，该报在《我们的书评组》一文中说，他们还组织了对其他一些书籍的阅读和评介，并“准备在取得经验以后，再行扩大范围”。这个工作是有意义的和可以试行的。
    新闻总署和出版总署在“关于全国报纸期刊均应建立书报评论工作的指示”中，要求“全国各种报纸……都应当根据具体的需要和可能”建立书报评论工作，小型的通俗报纸也不例外，介绍和推荐通俗读物正是这些报纸的重要任务。在目前，报刊出版工作的通俗化是一个严重的问题，一方面报刊出版物停留在一部分人手中，另一方面广大工农群众和基层干部缺少适合他们需要的读物。为了改进和发展通俗读物，最重要的工作之一就是进行通俗读物的评介工作，把这些读物在群众中试读，以便取得经验，力求改进。目前各地已在出版了一些地方性的通俗读物，这些读物应该成为地方通俗报纸进行书评工作最主要的对象。协同有关机关团体的工作人员组织工农群众阅读和评论这种通俗读物，是报纸的政治任务。
    沈阳日报的初步经验证明，组织大家来作书评工作是可能的，并且已经有了一些收获。由于工厂书评组把通俗读物在读报组中、小型有线广播中向工人读讲，就把书籍直接带到工人读者面前去了，帮助了工人教育工作，同时工人对通俗读物的意见具体地集中地反映到报纸上来，就可以对通俗化的工作有直接的裨益，并给通俗读物的作者以直接的教育。沈阳日报在发表了对《美国的经济危机》一书的评介之后，该书作者立即写信给报社表示这种评介“不论对读者与作者都有很大的帮助”。对读者负责的通俗读物作者当然是尊重工农群众的意见，愿意把他们的意见当作改进通俗读物写作的准绳的。同时，报纸上发表了这样的书评，也就真正起了介绍和推广的作用，据沈阳日报调查，报纸在评介了《美国的经济危机》之后，该书的“读者大大地增加了，沈阳市民有很多上图书馆指定要借这本书阅读”。因此，报纸在指导书刊的通俗化工作和推广群众的读书运动上便都起了他应有的作用。
    大家来做书评工作对于通俗化读物的评介是很有效的方法。其他一般书刊甚至专门性的书刊也可以采取这样的方法组织各种学习小组、学生、教育和研究机关等，对书刊提出个别的或共同的意见，发动大家来做书评工作。
