The Second National Electricity Conference, which opened on March 10th, concluded on the 22nd. Based on the needs of national economic construction in 1951 and the current situation of the national electricity industry, the conference determined the guiding principles and tasks for the national electricity work this year as follows: 1. Guarantee power supply. It is required that the national state-owned electricity industry increase its electricity sales by 21.6% compared to last year. 2. Ensure safe power transmission and distribution, and basically eliminate accidents, especially personal accidents and major equipment damage accidents. 3. Implement regular maintenance and improve equipment output. 4. Implement the economic accounting system and reduce various consumption quotas. 5. Strengthen the work of cultivating cadres and learn advanced Soviet technology. State-owned electricity management agencies at all levels should establish technical cadre schools and training courses at all levels. 6. Do a good job in various preparatory work for basic construction. 7. Implement the reward system. The conference made specific provisions for the methods and measures to achieve the above tasks.

In the past year, the national electricity workers implemented the resolutions of the First National Electricity Conference, overfulfilled the annual power generation and sales tasks, improved the output and utilization rate of power generation equipment, reduced the number of accidents by more than half compared to the previous year, and reduced coal consumption, plant power consumption, and line losses. These achievements saved the country wealth equivalent to about 1.549 billion catties of millet. The conference commended and rewarded a total of 55 outstanding electricity bureaus, plants, workshops, and groups on the electricity production front in 1950, and a total of 50 model workers, bureau chiefs, plant directors, and engineers. The conference also awarded flags and medals to Soviet experts who made significant contributions to the restoration and development of China's electricity industry in the past year.

The achievements of state-owned power plants across the country in overhauling equipment in 1950 proved that overhaul work is the basic method to restore equipment effectiveness and eliminate accidents. Last year, due to the good overhaul work, the output of generators in state-owned power plants across the country increased by 8.48% compared to 1949. Among them, the output of generators in Shijingshan, Tianjin, Fushun, Huainan, Shijiazhuang and other power plants reached 100%. In these power plants, many old machines still operate like new machines after overhaul. Last year, the overhaul work of state-owned power plants across the country also had a significant effect on eliminating accidents. Accidents in the Northeast, North China, and East China regions in 1950 decreased by 52% compared to 1949. In 1950, the number of accidents in the fourth quarter decreased by 61.5% compared to the first quarter. In addition, because the effectiveness of equipment improved after overhaul, various consumptions also decreased significantly. For example, after overhauling the boiler in Yangquan Power Plant, coal consumption per kilowatt-hour decreased from 2.58 kilograms to 1.74 kilograms.

Before the First National Electricity Conference in February last year, many electricity workers had conservative ideas of unwillingness to overhaul. They believed that "old machines are full of holes and beyond repair." Some even believed that overhaul was just "applying plaster" and would not help. Therefore, they simply hoped to increase power generation capacity by increasing machines, and to avoid power outages during accidents by increasing backup equipment. However, the achievements of the national state-owned power plants in overhauling last year showed that under the current conditions where the country's financial resources are not yet abundant, making full use of and giving full play to the effectiveness of existing equipment is an effective way to increase production and improve quality. Last year, in the overhaul work, various power plants accepted advanced Soviet technical experience and solved many technical problems that could not be solved in the past, such as the dynamic balance of turbine generators, the grounding of generator rotors, and the drying of transformers, which improved the technical level of Chinese electricity workers. Secondly, in the process of overhaul, many power plants overcame the difficulties of material shortage with the spirit of self-reliance. Therefore, the incorrect idea that some people used to think that problems could not be solved without foreign goods was also corrected.

At present, the effectiveness of power generation machines across the country has not been fully utilized, and accidents in power transmission and distribution still occur frequently in many electricity units. Therefore, carrying out comprehensive and planned regular maintenance is still an important task for the national electricity industry in 1951. According to the resolution of the Second National Electricity Conference, the national electricity industry will implement an inspection and acceptance system this year to improve the quality of overhaul work. State-owned electricity in various regions will also establish special overhaul agencies at all levels to ensure timely, adequate, and qualified supply of overhaul materials. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　二次全国电业会议确定今年工作方针任务       
    保证电力供应做到基本消灭事故       
    去年国营电厂经验证明：检修工作，是恢复设备效能和消灭事故基本办法。
    三月十日开幕的第二次全国电业会议，已于二十二日结束。会议根据一九五一年国家经济建设的需要和当前全国电业工作的情况，确定今年全国电业工作的方针任务是：一、保证电力供应。要求全国国营电业今年的售电量比去年增加百分之二十一·六。二、保证安全发送电，做到基本上消灭事故，特别是人身事故和主要设备损坏事故。三、实行定期检修，提高设备出力。四、贯彻经济核算制，降低各项消耗定额。五、加强培养干部工作，学习苏联先进技术。各级国营电业管理机构应分别举办各级技术干部学校和训练班。六、做好基本建设的各种准备工作。七、推行奖励制度。对于实现上述任务的办法和措施，会议都作了具体规定。
    过去一年中，全国电业职工执行了第一次全国电业会议的决议，超额完成了全年发售电任务，提高了发电设备的出力和利用率，事故次数比前年减少了一半以上，并减低了煤耗、厂用电和线路损失。这些成就，共为国家节省了约十五亿四千九百多万斤小米的财富。会议表扬和奖励了一九五○年电业生产战线上优秀的电业局、厂、车间、小组共五十五个单位，和模范的工人、局长、厂长、工程师等共五十人。对一年来在我国电业的恢复发展工作中作了重大帮助的苏联专家，会议也颁发了奖旗和奖章。（新华社）
    全国国营电厂在一九五○年检修设备的成绩，证明了检修工作是恢复设备效能和消灭事故的基本方法。去年全国国营电厂因检修工作作得好，使发电机出力比一九四九年提高了百分之八点四八。其中石景山、天津、抚顺、淮南、石家庄等电厂发电机的出力更达到了百分之百。在这些电厂里，许多老旧机器经过检修后，运转起来仍然和新机器一样。去年全国国营电厂的检修工作在消灭事故方面的作用，也很显著。东北、华北、华东三地区一九五○年的事故比一九四九年减少了百分之五十二。在一九五○年内，第四季度的事故次数又比第一季度减少了百分之六十一点五。此外由于检修后设备效能提高，所以各种消耗也显著减少。如阳泉电厂检修锅炉后，每度电的煤耗就由二点五八公斤降低到一点七四公斤。
    去年二月第一次全国电业会议以前，在许多电业职工中都存在着不愿检修的保守思想。他们认为“机器老旧，百孔千疮，修不胜修”。有人更认为检修不过是“贴膏药”，无济于事。所以他们单纯地希望以增加机器来增加发电能力，和以增加备用设备来避免发生事故时停电。但是去年全国国营电厂进行检修的成绩，却说明在目前国家财力还不充裕的条件下，尽量利用并充分发挥现有设备的效能，是提高生产，改进质量的有效办法。去年各电厂在检修工作中，接受了苏联先进技术经验，解决了许多过去不能解决的技术问题，如透平发电机的动平衡问题，发电机转子接地问题，变压器的干燥问题等，使我国电业职工的技术水平提高一步。其次，在检修过程中，不少电厂以自力更生的精神克服了器材缺乏的困难。所以过去某些人认为没有外国货就不能解决问题的不正确思想也得到了纠正。
    目前全国发电机器的效能还有很多没有发挥出来，许多电业单位发送电中的事故也还时有发生，所以进行全面的和有计划的定期检修仍是一九五一年全国电业的重要工作。根据第二次全国电业会议的决议，今年全国电业将实行检查与验收制度，以提高检修工作的质量。各区国营电业并将建立各级检修的专责机构，以保证及时地、充裕地、合格地供应检修器材。（新华社）
