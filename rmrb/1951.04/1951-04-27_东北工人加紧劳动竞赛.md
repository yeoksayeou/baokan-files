Workers in Northeast China are stepping up their labor emulation drive to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day.

In the coal mining sector, since the Shi Yuhai team issued a challenge to coal miners across the country to greet "May Day," a safety production emulation campaign has been launched enthusiastically throughout the region. Currently, more than 250 teams, shifts, and mine pits have responded to the Shi Yuhai team's challenge. They all regard guaranteeing no casualties and fulfilling and exceeding the annual production task as the main conditions for the competition.

In the railway sector, the China Changchun Railway Bureau has launched a friendly competition with the Qiqihar, Jilin, and Jinzhou Railway Bureaus, with conditions such as completing transportation tasks, shortening vehicle turnaround time, reducing transportation costs, and promoting advanced working methods. Some advanced stations, sections, chartered car groups, and labor models have also put forward their own unit's and individual competition plans. For example, Shi Kun, a special-class labor model of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau, aims to achieve "three mores and two goods" (saving more coal, exceeding axle load more, traveling more safe kilometers; good maintenance of locomotives, good cleaning) as a gift to welcome "May Day."

In other factory departments, the emulation campaign is also being carried out enthusiastically. The Liu Lifu team of a factory in Dalian, which has not produced any defective products for more than a year and has overfulfilled its production tasks every month, has created even greater achievements in the "May Day" emulation drive. In just seven days, it overfulfilled its April production task by 20 percent. The "May Day" emulation campaign in factories in Shenyang was initiated in early April by all the representatives of the city's labor model representative meeting. Workers in each factory generally aim to complete the April production task ahead of schedule, do a good job in security inspections, and promote Jiang Wanshou's experience in improving labor organization or the Gwarev work method according to the specific circumstances of their unit. The employees of the Harbin Power Plant created and improved ten tools in the first quarter of this year. In order to welcome "May Day," they put forward the slogan "Everyone come up with ideas" and launched a competition for each workshop to create a tool.

While enthusiastically carrying out labor emulation drives, workers in various places are now using their spare time to prepare for the "May Day" grand demonstration activities. This includes learning to sing the five demonstration parade songs designated by the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association; training the factory (mine) protection teams of employees responsible for protecting the factory (mine) on "May Day"; and rushing to make slogans and charts showing workers' production achievements for the parade. Many factories and mines have also held symposiums and report meetings to publicize the significance of this year's "May Day" grand demonstration.

### 东北工人加紧劳动竞赛

　　东北工人加紧劳动竞赛
    东北各地工人正以紧张的劳动竞赛迎接“五一”国际劳动节。
    在煤矿部门，自施玉海小组为迎接“五一”向全国煤矿工人提出挑战后，安全生产的竞赛运动迅即在全区热烈展开。目前向施玉海小组应战的小组、班和矿坑已达二百五十多个单位。他们都以保证不发生伤亡事故、完成并超过全年生产任务作为主要的竞赛条件。
    在铁路部门，中长铁路局已与齐齐哈尔、吉林、锦州铁路局之间，展开了以完成运输任务、缩短车辆周转率、减低运输成本及推行先进工作方法等为条件的友谊竞赛。有些先进的站、段、包车组和劳动模范并提出了本单位的和个人的竞赛计划。如齐齐哈尔铁路局特等劳动模范石昆，即以做到“三多两好”（省煤多、超轴多、走行安全公里多；机车保养好、清扫好）作为迎接“五一”的献礼。
    在其他部门各工厂中，竞赛运动也正在热烈开展。一年多来从未出过废品、月月超额完成生产任务的旅大市某工厂刘立富小组，在迎接“五一”的竞赛中又创造了更大的成绩，仅七天时间即超额百分之二十完成了四月份的生产任务。沈阳市各工厂迎接“五一”的竞赛运动，是在四月初由该市劳动模范代表会议全体代表所发起的。各厂工人一般均以提前完成四月份的生产任务、做好保安大检查、并根据本单位的具体情况推广姜万寿改进劳动组织的经验或郭瓦廖夫工作方法为奋斗目标。哈尔滨发电厂的职工们，在今年第一季度曾创造和改进了十件工具。为了迎接“五一”，他们又提出“大家出主意”的口号，展开了每个车间创造一件工具的竞赛运动。
    各地工人在热烈展开劳动竞赛的同时，现正利用工余时间进行准备“五一”大示威的活动。如学唱中国人民抗美援朝总会指定的五个示威游行歌曲；训练在“五一”当天负责护厂（矿）的职工护厂（矿）队；赶制游行用的标语和显示工人生产成绩的图表等。很多厂矿并举行了座谈会、报告会，宣传今年“五一”大示威的意义。
