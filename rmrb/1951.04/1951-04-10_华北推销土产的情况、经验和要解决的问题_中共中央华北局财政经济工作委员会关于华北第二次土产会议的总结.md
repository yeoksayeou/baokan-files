　　The situation, experiences, and problems to be solved in the North China promotion of local products
   Summary of the Second North China Local Products Conference by the Financial and Economic Work Committee of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee
  (I)
    From mid-November of last year to the present, the five provinces, two municipalities, and most special districts, counties, provincial-level cities, and several districts and towns of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in North China have convened local product conferences. All six special districts, two municipalities, and fifty-four counties in the plains have held local product conferences, of which two special districts and seventeen counties have held them twice. Puyang Special District has universally convened local product conferences at the district level. At the village level, the promotion of local products has been studied through production committees, members' meetings of supply and marketing cooperatives, and meetings of CPC party branches. Some areas have also convened various forms of material exchange symposiums, handicraft representative conferences, and urban-rural trade conferences. Through the organization and promotion of these meetings, the promotion of local products has formed a broad mass movement in many areas of North China and has achieved great success. According to incomplete statistics, the total value of local products in North China, excluding commodity grain and economic crops such as cotton, peanuts, and flue-cured tobacco leaves, is approximately equivalent to 7 billion catties of raw grain, accounting for slightly more than one-quarter of North China's total grain output. As of the end of February this year, approximately 70 percent of all local products have been sold, equivalent to nearly 5 billion catties of raw grain, exceeding North China's total annual public grain quota last year. Due to the rapid recovery of agricultural production, stable prices, the bumper harvest last year, and the sale of most local products, this has greatly promoted the increase of farmers' purchasing power, stimulated the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, overcome the difficulties of insufficient national trade funds, consolidated market price stability, and increased national tax revenue. It has also opened up a vast domestic market, dealing a severe blow to the economic blockade imposed by American imperialism.
  (II)
    In the three and a half months of promoting local products, the following experiences have been gained:
    1. Holding good local product conferences or various forms of material exchange conferences at all levels is the most important method for solving the problem of local product promotion. Such conferences must have adequate preparation in advance. The conferences must include responsible cadres from party leadership organs, industrial and commercial administrative departments, state-owned trading companies, local product companies, export companies, cooperatives, banks, tax bureaus, transportation departments, and federations of industry and commerce, market committees, exchanges, and warehouses, as well as representatives of private merchants from various industries and trades, and local product representatives of all types (handicraft representatives, farmer representatives, production experts). The principal leader must be responsible, personally preside, and explain the importance of promoting local products and the state's policies for rewarding the management of local products, overcome the erroneous view of cadres who belittle commerce, eliminate the concerns of private merchants, unify various economic forces, and fully introduce and study the production, transportation, sales, specifications, prices, seasonal patterns, and past and present material exchange routes of local products to each other, find new sales channels, and formulate plans. If conditions are ripe, trade contracts can be signed at the meeting to establish exchange relations in a timely manner. In addition, cities and localities can attend each other's local product conferences, exchange experiences, understand the situation, and facilitate promotion.
    2. Adopt different promotion methods based on the different sales situations of various local products. Commodity grain, economic crops, and exported agricultural and sideline products should be pre-purchased from farmers by state-owned trading companies and cooperatives. For slow-selling local products, state-owned trading companies must take the lead in organizing cooperatives, private merchants, and the masses to promote sales. When the state pre-purchases agricultural and sideline products from farmers, it can adopt the following three methods: part cash, part in kind, and part on credit. Credit can be provided through a single in-kind deposit or a prize-winning savings scheme, which guarantees principal and value, and offers prizes and interest, while avoiding cumbersome procedures, which farmers are happy to accept. If there is a famine year, and farmers cannot deliver the cotton, hemp, and tobacco pre-sold to the state on time, the delivery can be postponed to the following year. If seeds are lacking, banks can provide loans.
    3. Restore old and establish new commercial networks. We have gained the following experiences: 1. Dispatch trade visiting groups or sales groups with experienced merchants and experts to production and sales areas to make contact and establish relationships. 2. State-owned trading companies and cooperatives, and private merchants, select key economic points and open warehouses with strong throughput capacity as distribution centers and transaction intermediaries, which play a large role in developing material exchange. These warehouses should only charge appropriate handling fees and should not have additional demands. All the bad habits of old warehouses should be strictly avoided. However, at the beginning, handling fees should not be limited too low, but should be slightly higher to encourage them. 3. Establish county and town markets with a bridge-like function to enhance distribution capacity. State-owned trade in small towns, especially in economically backward and inconveniently located areas, should take the lead in establishing comprehensive joint stores and district and village sales teams. Cooperatives should also be developed. 4. Strengthen leadership over primary markets such as fairs, temple fairs, and horse and mule fairs to facilitate exchanges.
    4. Widely promote the contract system. Trade contracts can find fixed sales channels for local products and are one of the best forms for promoting local products and organizing material exchange. The contract should specify the type of commodity, name, specifications, price, quantity, time limit, wear and tear, transportation, compensation, accidents, delivery location, expense payment, and weights and measures. It should be conducted gradually, continuously, from small to large, and from short-term to long-term. The phenomenon of blindly signing contracts should be corrected. After the contract is signed, both parties should be urged to strictly abide by their credit. Those who break their credit should be given legal and economic sanctions. Contracts between urban and rural areas and between regions should be supervised by the Urban-Rural Trade Committee. Contracts between local companies, cooperatives, and private merchants should be supervised by the Local Financial and Economic Work Committee. Changes in the situation should be corrected in a timely manner. If there are difficulties, assistance should be provided. If disputes arise, mediation should be carried out. After the contract is executed, it should be summarized to accumulate experience and further promote it.
    5. Organize private merchants to promote local products. In the entire material exchange and major material procurement and sales, state-owned commerce and cooperatives undoubtedly play a leading role. However, under the current situation where state-owned commerce and cooperatives lack manpower and resources, and the broad masses have a huge and urgent demand for the promotion of local products, it is necessary to lead and organize private merchants to manage local products, which is beneficial to farmers and beneficial to the country's entire economy. Some people say: "Private merchants have intermediate exploitation," which is a fact. However, it is more beneficial to farmers to sell local products by exploiting a little than not to have private merchants manage them and abandon all local products on the ground. The reason why we organize and welcome private merchants to go to the countryside to purchase and sell local products is to welcome them to serve industrial and agricultural production. Therefore, private merchants must be given appropriate profits, and it is wrong to exclude private merchants from managing local products. Then, are we afraid that private merchants will monopolize and manipulate the market? No, because important commodities such as grain, cotton, yarn, coal, and salt are all controlled by state-owned trade, coupled with the provisions of government laws, it is possible to guide private merchants to move towards a path that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Various places have a lot of experience in organizing private merchants to manage local products: 1. Organize private merchants or joint public-private visiting groups to communicate information and establish trade relations in various places. 2. Promote private merchants to formulate operating plans to reduce their blindness. 3. Establish public-private industry-wide purchasing and sales research organizations to provide business guidance. 4. Mobilize local private merchants to write letters to foreign merchants. Please foreign merchants remit money to order goods, and organize private merchants to jointly operate according to the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, and encourage them to purchase and sell goods in remote areas. Local public and private banks should provide convenient joint loans and acceptance financing. 5. Organize private merchants to purchase local products from farmers on credit, and carry industrial products to the countryside to directly exchange with farmers. 6. Allow local product merchants to operate other businesses in order to turnover. 7. State-owned trading companies and trust companies can establish consignment purchase and sales relationships with private merchants. In places where state-owned trade and cooperative forces are weak, public-private joint venture stores and warehouses can also be tried. 8. Local product taxes can be reduced if they are high, and can be removed if they are inappropriate. Railway freight rates can also be reduced or exempted for slow-selling local products. 9. The local government should adopt a welcoming attitude towards private merchants who go to the countryside, introduce reliable warehouses and hotels, warmly entertain them, hold urban-rural material exchange symposiums, and introduce to private merchants the local products that existed in the past and their sales channels, and the current production, specifications, prices, and other conditions. The price should be reasonable so that private merchants can make a profit. Encourage and protect private merchants' management of local products in many ways.
    6. Give full play to the role of supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives. The work of promoting local products proves that cooperatives are indeed a link between state-owned trade and small farmers, and are the organizers of mutual exchange for the broad masses. The supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Hebei Province promoted local products worth 860 million catties of rice, which is 4.9 times more than state-owned trading companies, and 2 times more than the sum of state-owned and private sales, which shows that cooperatives have gradually become the main force in promoting local products. At the same time, rural credit loans should be carried out in a planned way to absorb farmers' idle funds (money, in kind) to overcome the difficulties in farmers' production and life. However, many farmers still retain ideological concerns such as "fear of showing off wealth," "fear of not keeping promises," and "fear of inconvenience." In order to break these concerns and carry out rural credit work, in addition to further implementing the state's free loan policy, credit cooperatives must strictly abide by their credit, and the deposit procedures should be simple. Methods such as whole loan whole return, whole loan zero return, whole deposit whole withdrawal, and whole deposit zero withdrawal can be adopted. The interest rate is generally higher than that of banks and lower than that of private individuals. In areas with inconvenient transportation and sparse population, banks can organize financial circulation teams to go deep into districts and villages to handle deposits and loans.
    7. Mass exchange must be organized. Local products are usually widely distributed, with various varieties, large quantities, and large volumes. It is difficult to complete all tasks by relying solely on state-owned trade, cooperatives, and private merchants. Therefore, short-distance promotion by the masses must be organized. Hebei organized the exchange of cold goods for cold goods, and turned both ends into hot goods. The organization of short-distance material exchange by the masses is very common in various special districts and counties in Pingyuan Province, such as mountain areas exchanging persimmons and wood for plain areas' Chinese cabbage and vermicelli. Puyang County and districts and villages signed four, five, or six various exchange contracts. Seventy percent of the nineteen kinds of local products in Handan Special District are sold through decentralized sales by the masses. Temple fairs, horse and mule fairs, and department store fairs, which are generally held in various places, are good ways to organize short-distance exchanges and should be promoted. The Shijiazhuang Department Store Fair has an average of 30,000 people every day, and sells a lot of goods. Therefore, the promotion of local products must look downward and organize the capital and manpower of the masses. The idea that "you can't promote local products without money" by those who only know how to reach up for funds has been proven wrong by facts.
    8. Organize mass transportation to overcome the difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity. Last autumn, Hebei Province organized more than 15,000 carts (including 5,000 private carts) and more than 3,700 wooden boats, which played a significant role in promoting local products. Party committees and governments in various places should systematically establish transportation networks on both sides of land and water transportation trunk lines. Inland waterway transportation and cart roads must be dredged and repaired as necessary. In areas lacking transportation tools, in addition to organizing and repairing the existing carts and boats of the masses, loans should also be provided to help the masses organize transportation cooperatives. On several pedestrian cart roads and inland waterway docks and ferries, inns, mule and horse shops, cart shops, forges, restaurants, pharmacies, and patrol posts should be systematically set up to facilitate the travel of merchants and protect their safety.
  (III)
    In addition to the above achievements, the following shortcomings still exist in the work of promoting local products in North China, which must be overcome immediately: (1) Insufficient enthusiasm for finding sales channels for slow-selling goods; (2) Insufficient long-term planning and systematic management; (3) Uneven development of work, with some areas only recently starting. In order to further develop the work of promoting local products in 1951, in addition to continuing to carry forward the existing experience, the following series of problems must also be solved:
    1. Solve the difficulty of insufficient supply of industrial products. Due to the continuous improvement of farmers' purchasing power, it is necessary to buy a large number of industrial products, such as cloth, coal, agricultural tools, wood, iron nails, matches, cigarettes, etc., which have recently been in short supply. If this is not solved in a timely manner, the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products will further expand, which will not only cause great pain and dissatisfaction to farmers, but also risk the stagnation of urban-rural exchanges. Therefore, the state and local governments should actively and systematically restore and develop local industries and handicrafts, mainly light industry, to solve the current difficulty of insufficient industrial products. According to statistics from Hebei Province, machine-made industrial products account for only 20 percent of the production and living materials purchased by farmers, and handicraft products account for about 80 percent. This situation will not change much in a considerable period of time in the future. Therefore, state-owned trade and cooperatives should support the development of local industries and handicrafts in many ways.
    2. Systematically guide the production of local products. For those that sell well, such as pig bristles, fur, peanuts, coarse hemp, flue-cured tobacco leaves, and sunflower seeds, the quality should be improved, specifications should be emphasized, costs should be reduced, and mass production should be carried out. For those that basically have sales channels but are currently experiencing some difficulties, such as peach kernels, apricot kernels, red dates, and black dates, in addition to actively opening up the domestic market and organizing exports, areas with transportation difficulties can allow the masses to use red and black dates to make wine. For those that are currently slow-selling but will have sales channels in the future, such as skin nitrate, fire nitrate, mirabilite, gypsum, natural alkali, fine straw braid, fox skin, and various fine skins, in addition to improving quality to meet specifications, reducing costs, and actively opening up sales channels, production should be determined according to sales for the time being. For those that currently have sales channels but will not have sales channels in the near future, farmers should be told not to continue to develop and expand. For those that have no sales channels now or in the future, farmers should be persuaded to stop production and change careers, and blind production should be strictly avoided.
    3. Continue to develop the work of promoting local products. To this end, it is necessary to:
    (1) Continue to overcome the incorrect ideas of some cadres who belittle commerce, blindly exclude private merchants, and "emphasize hot goods and belittle cold goods," "emphasize plains and belittle mountains," and "emphasize large quantities and belittle small quantities," and strive to sell the remaining local products and slow-selling goods before the busy spring plowing season.
    (2) Further expand the scope of exchange. Organize North China promotion groups to carry samples and brochures to visit and promote sales in East China, Central China, and other places. The North China Cooperative General Office and the five provinces can send promotion teams to be stationed in cities such as Shanghai, Hankou, and Guangzhou, and be led by the local financial committees. Invite merchants from the north and south to hold a symposium on medicinal materials from the north and south, and develop medical cooperatives to lower the prices of raw medicinal materials and exchange urban prepared medicines. Organize private merchants to sell in remote areas to expand north-south exchanges. Each province, city, and Inner Mongolia mutually dispatch promotion teams to hold local product exhibitions of each province and county in North China, and establish local product markets and local product exhibition halls in major and medium-sized cities in North China. Provinces and cities establish mutual consignment sales relations and sign agreements or trade contracts as much as possible to expand exchanges between the five provinces, two cities, and Inner Mongolia in North China. Strengthen the distribution role of small towns, with counties setting up comprehensive stores and specialized areas setting up specialized companies or specialized warehouses. Establish and strengthen leadership over primary markets according to seasonality, rectify temple fairs and markets, establish urban-rural department store fairs, etc., to carry out local short-distance material exchanges. It is also recommended that the government change the exchanges in primary markets into warehouses, and appropriately adjust local product tax rates, train freight rates, zero-wholesale price differences, regional price differences, seasonal price differences, and listed prices to facilitate material exchanges.
    (3) Strengthen transportation. The Financial and Economic Work Committees of each province should establish regular contact with the railway bureaus of each province. The People's Governments and Cooperatives of each province should send local product promotion plans to the railway administrations of each province on a monthly basis, and concentrate local products waiting for shipment on time. The railway bureau should allocate vehicles in a planned and timely manner. In addition, it is necessary to combine transportation tools and forces such as trains, cars, carts, and boats, systematically establish transportation cooperatives, vigorously restore inland waterway transportation, and seize the slack farming season to organize the transportation forces of the masses to overcome the difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity and inconvenient transportation.
    (4) Create brands. To this end, it is necessary to improve local product production technology, improve the quality of local products, process and pack them, reduce costs, and strive for standardization. Oppose adulteration. And make full use of newspapers, radio stations, exhibitions, exhibition halls, temple fairs, movies, etc. to widely publicize the importance of promoting local products and the names, quantities, qualities, specifications, prices, sales channels, uses, and other information of local products. Local product samples should be accompanied by brochures to attract customers and solicit more customers.
    (5) Adjust trade administrative institutions. A local product company should be established in North China. Local product processing factories should be added in various places. Unify the purchase and sales management of various provinces and cities in North China in Tianjin and Shanghai. Provinces, special districts, and counties should absorb responsible cadres from relevant departments to establish local product promotion committees or material exchange committees to study and solve problems in local product promotion and exchange promotion experience. The experience of setting up a special local product promotion department under the Shanxi Commercial Department can be imitated by each province after reporting to the central government for approval.
    (6) Strengthen leadership. The financial and economic work committees at all levels should unify various financial and economic forces and reflect the leading role of the state-owned economy in practical work. Provinces, special districts, and counties must thoroughly understand the basic information such as the names, types, output, prices, specifications, uses, seasonality, and sales channels of local products, establish a business intelligence network, and communicate information to facilitate promotion. Leaders at all levels should pay attention to the development and changes of the economic situation, and guide the production and promotion of local products according to the new situation. In addition to being proficient in business, all economic work cadres must pay special attention to studying politics, theory, and policies, spur themselves on, and constantly move forward, and prevent and overcome the bad phenomena of neglecting politics and neglecting the study of theory and policies.

　　华北推销土产的情况、经验和要解决的问题
   中共中央华北局财政经济工作委员会关于华北第二次土产会议的总结
  （一）
    自去年十一月半至现在，华北五省、二市和内蒙古自治区大部专区、县、省直属市和若干区、镇均召开了土产会议。平原的六个专区、两个市、五十四个县均已开过土产会议，其中有两个专区十七个县开了两次；濮阳专区普遍开了区的土产会议；村一级则多经过生产委员会、供销社社员大会、中共党的支部会研究土产推销。有的地区还召开了各种不同形式的物资交流座谈会、手工业代表会议和城乡贸易会议等。经过这些会议的组织和推动，推销土产在华北不少地区已形成广泛的群众运动，并已获得巨大成绩。据不完全统计：华北的土产品除商品粮和棉花、花生、烤烟叶等经济作物外，总值约合七十亿斤原粮，约占华北粮食总产量的四分之一强，至今年二月底，全部土产约已销出百分之七十，合原粮近五十亿斤，超过了华北去年全年公粮数。由于农业生产的迅速恢复、物价稳定、去年丰收、和大部土产品已推销出去，这对提高农民购买力，刺激工农业生产的恢复与发展，克服国家贸易资金不足的困难，巩固市场物价稳定，增加国家税收等方面均起了极大的推动作用，并且开辟了广阔的国内市场，使美帝国主义对我们的经济封锁遭到严重的打击。
  （二）
    在三个半月的推销土产工作中，获得以下经验：
    一、开好各级土产会议或各种不同形式的物资交流会议，是解决土产推销问题最重要的方法。这样的会议事先必须有适当的准备，会中必须有党的领导机关、工商行政部门、国营贸易公司、土产公司、出口公司、合作社、银行、税务局、交通部门和工商联合会、集市委员会、交易所、货栈各方面的负责干部以及各行各业私商代表、各地各类土产代表（手工业代表、农民代表、生产能手）参加，并须首长负责，亲自主持，讲清推销土产的重要性和国家奖励经营土产的政策，克服干部轻视商业的错误观点，消除私商的顾虑，统一各种经济力量，相互间充分介绍和研究土产的产、运、销、规格、价格、季节规律、和过去及现在物资交流的路线等情况，寻找新的推销门路，定出计划。如果条件成熟，并可在会上订立贸易合同，以便及时地把交流关系建立起来。此外，城市和地方可相互出席土产会议，交流经验，了解情况，便利推销。
    二、根据各种土产不同的销售情况，采取不同的推销办法。商品粮、经济作物和出口的农副产品，应由国营贸易公司和合作社向农民实行预购；滞销的土产，则须由国营贸易公司带头，组织合作社、私商和群众力量去推销。国家向农民预购农副产品时，可采取以下三种方式：一部现款，一部实物，一部赊账。赊账可采用单一实物存款或有奖储蓄办法，保本保值，有奖有息，又免手续麻烦，这是农民所乐意接受的。如遇荒年，农民预售给国家的棉、麻、烟不能按期交付时，可延至来年补交，如缺乏种籽，并可由银行贷放。
    三、恢复旧的与建立新的商业网。我们已取得了以下经验：１，派遣有老商人和内行参加的贸易访问团或推销组到产地、销地接洽，打通关系。２、国营贸易公司、合作社并带动私商选择经济要点，开办有强大吞吐能力的货栈，作为货物的集散地和成交媒介，对开展物资交流作用很大，这种货栈只宜抽取适当的手续费，不应有额外苛索，力戒旧货栈的一切陋规恶习。但开始时，手续费不应限制过低，应稍高些，以资鼓励。３、建立带桥梁性的县、镇市场，增强集散力量。国营贸易在小城镇，特别是在经济落后交通不便的地区应带头设立一揽子联合商店和区村推销小组。合作社也应发展。４、加强对初级市场如集市、庙会、骡马大会的领导，便利交流。
    四、广泛推广合同制度。贸易合同可使土产品找到固定的销路，是推销土产组织物资交流的最好形式之一。合同上要写明商品种类、名称、规格、价格、数量、期限、耗损、运输、赔偿、意外事故、交接地点、费用支付和度量衡等，并要由小而大，由少而多，由短期到长期，逐步地连续地进行，要纠正盲目乱订合同的现象。合同订立后，要督促双方严守信用，对失信者，要给以法律和经济制裁。城乡、地区之间的合同，应由城乡贸易委员会监督执行；当地公司、合作社与私商间的合同，应由地方财政经济工作委员会监督执行。情况变化，及时修正；遇有困难，协助解决；发生纠纷，予以调处；合同执行后，应加总结，积累经验，进一步推广。
    五、组织私商推销土产。在整个物资交流中和主要物资购销上，国营商业和合作社无疑地是起主导作用的，但在目前国营商业、合作社人力资力不足和广大群众有庞大迫切要求土产推销的情况下，领导与组织私商经营土产是必要的，对农民是有利的，对国家整个经济是有好处的。有人说：“私商有中间剥削”，这是事实，但剥削一点把土产品卖掉，比不要私商经营，土产全弃于地对农民有利。我们之所以组织与欢迎私商下乡购销土产，是欢迎其为工农业生产服务。因此，必须给私商以适当利润，而排斥私商经营土产是错误的。那么怕不怕私商垄断操纵市场呢？不怕，因为粮食、棉花、纱布、煤、盐等重要商品全掌握在国营贸易手里，加上政府法令的规定，是可以引导私商朝向有利国计民生的道路走去的。各地在组织私商经营土产上，已有许多经验：１、组织私商或公私联合访问团，到各地沟通情况与建立贸易关系。２、推动私商订立经营计划，减少其盲目性。３、成立公私同业性的购销研究组织，予以业务指导。４、动员当地私商给外商写信。请外商汇款定货，根据自愿两利原则，组织私商联营，并鼓励其远地购销。当地公、私银行要给予联贷、押汇的方便。５，组织私商赊购农民土产品，和携带工业品下乡，直接与农民进行交换。６、允许土产商经营他业，以便周转。７、国营贸易公司、信托公司可与私商建立代购代销关系。在国营贸易和合作社力量薄弱的地方还可试办公私合营商店、货栈。８、土产税收高者可以减低，不合适者可以去掉，铁路运费对滞销土产还可以减价或免价。９、地方对下乡私商应采取欢迎态度，介绍可靠货栈、旅店，热烈招待，开城乡物资交流座谈会，向私商介绍本地过去有何土产及其销路，和现在的生产、规格、价格等情况。价格要合理，使私商有利可图。从多方面鼓励和保护私商经营土产。
    六、充分发挥供销合作社和信贷社的作用。推销土产工作证明：合作社确是国营贸易联系农民小生产者的纽带，是广大群众相互交换的组织者。河北省各级供销社共推销土产值米八亿六千万斤，比国营贸易公司多四点九倍，比国营、私商销数之和多两倍，这说明合作社已逐渐成为推销土产的主力。同时要有步骤地举办农村信用贷款，吸收农民游资（款、实物），以克服农民生产和生活上的困难，但目前不少农民仍残存着“怕露富”、“怕不守信用”、“怕不方便”等思想顾虑。为打破这些顾虑及开展农村信贷工作，除进一步贯彻国家借贷自由政策外，信贷社必须严守信用，存款手续要简便，并可采取整贷整还、整贷零还、整存整取、整存零取等方法，其利息一般以高于银行低于私人为原则。在交通不便地广人稀地区，可由银行组织金融流通小组，深入区、村办理存贷。
    七、必须组织群众性的交换，土产通常是分布广、品种杂、数量多、体积大，只靠国营贸易、合作社和私商去推销，势难完成全部任务。因此，必须组织群众短距离的推销。河北组织冷货换冷货，两头变热货，平原省各专区、县组织群众短距离的物资互换很普遍，如山地拿柿子、木料换平地的白菜、粉条；濮阳县区、村之间即订立了各种交换合同四五六件。邯郸专区十九种土产品，百分之七十是经群众分散推销的。各地普遍举办的庙会、骡马大会和百货大会等，是组织短距离交换的好办法，应予提倡。石家庄百货大会，每天平均有三万人，销货极多。因此，推销土产必须眼睛向下，组织群众的资力和人力，那些只知伸手向上要资金，“没钱就不能推销土产”的思想，事实证明是不对的。
    八、组织群众性的运输，克服运输力不足的困难。去秋河北省组织群众大车一万五千余辆（内私营大车五千辆），木船三千七百多只，对推销土产起了很大作用。各地党和政府应有计划地在水陆交通干线两侧，建立运输网，内河航运及车马大道须加以必要的疏浚与整修，交通工具缺乏的地区，除对群众现有车、船加以组织整修外，并应给以贷款，帮助群众组织运输合作社，在若干行人车马大道及内河码头、渡口上，应有计划地开设客栈、骡马大店、车铺、掌炉、饭铺、药铺、巡逻岗卡，便利商旅往来，保护商旅安全。
  （三）
    除以上成绩外，华北推销土产工作中还存在着以下缺点，须即克服：（１）积极为冷货找销路的劲头不足；（２）长远打算和系统经营不够；（３）工作发展不平衡，有些地区最近才着手。为了进一步开展一九五一年土产推销工作，除继续发扬已有经验外，还须解决以下一系列的问题：
    １、解决工业品供应不足的困难。由于农民购买力的不断提高，就需要买进大量的工业品，如布匹、煤炭、农具、木料、铁钉、火柴、香烟等近来均感缺乏，如不及时注意解决，工农产品剪刀差将会更加扩大，那不但会招致农民很大痛苦与不满，而且城乡交流将有死滞的危险。因此，国家和地方均应积极地有计划地恢复和发展以轻工业为主、地方工业及手工业，以解决当前工业品不足的困难。据河北省统计，农民买进的生产和生活资料中，机器工业品仅占百分之二十，手工业品约占百分之八十，这一情况在今后相当长的时间内是不会有很大改变的。因此，国营贸易和合作社应从多方面扶助地方工业和手工业的发展。
    ２、有计划地指导土产品的生产。对畅销的，如猪鬃、皮毛、花生、粗麻、烤烟叶、葵花子等，应提高质量、讲求规格、降低成本，大量生产；对基本上有销路，但目前稍有困难的，如桃仁、杏仁、红枣、乌枣等，除积极打开国内市场和组织出口外，运输困难的地区，可允许群众用红、乌枣烧酒；现在滞销将来有销路的，如皮硝、火硝、芒硝、石膏、天然碱、细草帽辫、猾子皮及各种细皮等，除改善质量，使合规格、降低成本，积极打开销路外，暂时应按销定产；对现在有销路，但不久将来无销路者，应告诉农民不要继续发展扩大；对现在将来均无销路者，应说服农民停产转业，力戒盲目生产。
    ３、继续开展土产推销工作，为此必须：
    （１）继续克服若干干部轻视商业、盲目排斥私商和“重热货、轻冷货”、“重平原、轻山地”、“重大宗、轻小宗”等不正确思想，争取在春耕大忙前把剩余土产品和冷背货推销出去。
    （２）进一步扩大交流范围。组织华北推销团，携带样品及说明书，赴华东、华中等地进行访问和推销。华北合作总社及五省可派推销小组常驻上海、汉口、广州等城市，并受当地财委领导。邀请南北药商，召开南北药材座谈会议，并发展医药合作社，降低生药价格，交换城市熟药。组织私商远销。以扩大南北交流。各省、市、内蒙古互派推销小组举办华北各省、各县的土产展览会并在华北各大中城市建立土产市场和土产陈列馆。各省市建立相互代销关系并尽可能订立协议，或贸易合同，以扩大华北五省二市及内蒙古之间的交流。加强小城镇的集散作用，县设一揽子商店，特产区设专业公司或专业货栈。根据季节性建立和加强对初级市场的领导，整顿庙会、集市，建立城乡百货大会等，以开展本乡本土的短距离的物资交流。并建议政府将初级市场的交易所改为货栈，并适当调整土产税率、火车运价及零整差价、地区差价、季节差价、和牌市价，便利物资交流。
    （３）加强运输。各省财政经济工作委员会应与各该省铁路局建立经常联系，各省人民政府与合作社要按月给各该省铁路管理局送土产推销计划，并按时集中待运的土产品，铁路局要有计划地及时地调拨车辆。此外，要把火车、汽车、大车和船只等运输工具和力量结合起来，有计划地成立运输合作社，大力恢复内河航运，并抓紧农闲季节，组织群众运输力量，克服运输力不足和交通不便的困难。
    （４）创牌子。为此必须改善土产生产技术，提高土产品的质量，加工整装，降低成本，力求规格化。反对搀杂使水。并充分利用报纸、广播台、展览会、陈列馆、庙会、电影等，广泛宣传推销土产的重要性和土产的名目、数量、质量、规格、价格、销路、用途等情况。土产样品要附有说明书，以广招徕，多拉主顾。
    （５）调整贸易行政机构。华北应设立土产公司。各地应增设土产加工工厂。统一华北各省、市在天津、上海的购销管理。各省、专区、县应吸收有关部门负责干部成立推销土产委员会，或物资交流委员会，研究解决土产推销中的问题，交流推销经验，山西商业厅下专设土产推销处的经验，各省可报请中央批准后仿行。
    （６）加强领导。各级财政经济工作委员会应统一各种财经力量，在实际工作中体现国营经济的领导作用。各省、专区、县要彻底弄清土产名称、种类、产量、价格、规格、用途、季节性、和销路等基本情况，建立商情网，互通行情，便利推销。各级领导应注意经济形势的发展和变化，要根据新的情况，指导土产的生产和推销。一切经济工作的干部除精通业务外，还要特别注意学习政治、理论和政策，鞭策自己，不断前进，防止和克服忽视政治和忽视学习理论、政策的不良现象。
