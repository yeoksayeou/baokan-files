　　Truth Daily International Review Points Out
　　MacArthur is a Strategist of Constant Defeat
　　This Challenge Statement Will Still Fail
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] Soviet newspapers have been carrying articles for days reporting the denunciations issued by the Chinese People's Anti-American Aid Korea Headquarters, various democratic parties, people's organizations, and the Beijing and Shanghai newspapers, condemning MacArthur's arrogant statement of March 24th. The Truth Daily's international review on the 1st commented: "There is no need to argue about the boastful parts of MacArthur's challenge statement; past experience is enough to expose the foolish bragging of this strategist of constant defeat. MacArthur, through his past actions, has demonstrated that the American imperialists' aggressive plans are not only to occupy Korea but also to attack the People's Republic of China. MacArthur's statement truly proves that the American imperialists have not abandoned this conspiracy even now. MacArthur's remarks have aroused deep anger among the peace-loving people of China and other countries."

　　真理报国际述评指出        
    麦克阿瑟是常败战略家       
    这次挑战声明仍要失败
    【新华社莫斯科三日电】苏联各报连日刊载了中国人民抗美援朝总会、各民主党派、各人民团体及京沪各报发表的痛斥麦克阿瑟三月二十四日狂妄声明的言论。一日真理报的国际述评评论称：“无需论证麦克阿瑟的挑战声明中自吹自擂的部分，过去的经验就足够揭穿这位常败战略家的愚蠢吹嘘了。麦克阿瑟以自己过去的行动，表明了美帝国主义者的侵略计划不仅要侵占朝鲜，而且要进攻中华人民共和国。麦克阿瑟的声明确实证明美帝国主义者现在也没有放弃这种阴谋。麦克阿瑟的言论已引起了中国及其他国家爱好和平人民的深切的愤怒。”
