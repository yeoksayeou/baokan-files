　　Oppose the US Separate Peace Treaty with Japan
　  Strive for a Comprehensive Peace Treaty with Japan
　　Mei Ru'ao
　　Responding to the Great Call of the World Peace Council
    At the first session of the World Peace Council held in Berlin at the end of February this year, ten resolutions were passed, the most important of which were:
    (1) Calling on people of all countries in the world to hold signatures in support of the declaration requesting the five major powers to conclude a peace pact;
    (2) Calling for national polls on the Japanese issue in Japan and appropriate countries in Asia, the Americas, and Oceania.
    In order to respond to this great call, the China Resistance to US Aggression and Aid Korea General Association is now enthusiastically launching a large-scale signature and voting campaign throughout the country.
    Regarding the vote on the Japanese issue, the General Association, inspired by the resolution of the World Peace Council, stipulates the following two items:
    1. Oppose the US arming of Japan; oppose the US separate peace treaty with Japan.
    2. Advocate the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan to promote peace and democracy for the Japanese people.
    Today, I want to talk to you about the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. I want to explain to you: From the standpoint of the Chinese people, why should we resolutely oppose the US separate peace treaty with Japan? Why should we resolutely strive for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan?

  Oppose the US Separate Peace Treaty with Japan
    Let's first talk about why we should oppose the US separate peace treaty with Japan?
    A separate peace treaty with Japan is the most vicious and cruel conspiracy of the United States, which is selfish, self-interested, and violates its faith. We have many reasons to oppose it, the most important of which are three:
    First, the US separate peace treaty with Japan is a completely illegal act that destroys international agreements and violates international practices.
    Everyone knows that the issue of how to deal with defeated countries should have been resolved by all the victorious Allied countries holding a peace conference, jointly consulting, and concluding a comprehensive peace treaty. This has been the international practice since ancient times. The US's separate peace treaty with Japan is an absurd act that completely disregards this international practice and is unprecedented. At the same time, it is also an act of destroying international agreements, because the Washington Declaration of January 1, 1942, signed by 26 countries including China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, India, and Canada, clearly stipulates that "each government undertakes to cooperate with the governments of the countries signing this declaration and not to conclude a separate armistice agreement or peace treaty with the enemy countries." According to the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration of August 3, 1945, and the resolution of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of December 3, 1945, the peace treaty with the defeated country should be drafted jointly by the Foreign Ministers' Conference, maintaining the principle of consensus among the major powers. Now, the United States completely disregards these solemn international agreements, acts arbitrarily, insists on concluding a bilateral peace treaty with Japan alone, and threatens and induces other Allied countries to individually join this treaty. It doesn't even plan to hold a formal peace conference. Can we not resolutely oppose this arbitrary, despotic, and absurd illegal act by the United States?
    Second, the US separate peace treaty with Japan is an act of excluding China from participation and undermining China's interests.
    In the war to defeat Japanese imperialism, China was a major force. We fought hard for eight years, deeply dragging Japan into the quagmire. During these eight years, our sacrifices were enormous: more than ten million lives were lost, and property losses exceeded 5 million US dollars. Since our contribution and sacrifices in the War of Resistance against Japan were so great, we should of course have full say in the peace treaty with Japan. However, the US conspiracy for a separate peace treaty with Japan today completely ignores us. It not only ignores the Soviet Union's protest and legal call for a four-nation Foreign Ministers' Conference to jointly draft the treaty, not only does it not convene an Allied peace conference on Japan to jointly discuss it, but it doesn't even send a copy of its separate draft peace treaty to the new Chinese People's Government. This proves that it completely wants to exclude us from participating. Not only that, but as far as we know, the content of the clauses of its draft peace treaty with Japan also seriously harms China's interests. For example, according to the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, Taiwan is undoubtedly Chinese territory. However, the US draft separate peace treaty with Japan deliberately does not mention the return of Taiwan to China. This is just one example. In addition, there are many other places in the US draft that harm our interests!
    The US separate peace treaty with Japan not only fundamentally excludes China's participation but also harms China's interests everywhere. This is an unconscionable, illegal, and unjust act by the United States. Can the Chinese people, who fought bloody battles against Japan for eight years and sacrificed so much, not resolutely oppose this act?
    Third, the more important reason why we oppose the US separate peace treaty with Japan is that the US separate peace treaty with Japan is an act of preparing to expand aggression against China, undermine peace in the Far East, and provoke a world war.
    Everyone knows that the purpose of the US separate peace treaty with Japan is, on the one hand, to treatyize, legalize, and perpetuate the various economic, political, and military rights and interests that it has illegally obtained by monopolizing Japan for nearly six years, especially to maintain its right to station troops in Japan and many naval and air bases. But the more important aspect is to massively arm Japan, to make the Japanese accomplices and cannon fodder. It is true that the US arming of Japan has already begun, the disguised Japanese army, navy, and air force have been established, and Japanese accomplices have played a considerable role in the war of aggression against Korea. However, during the occupation period without the signing of a peace treaty, it is still not very convenient to blatantly arm Japan or dispatch Japanese troops overseas on a large scale. Therefore, the United States is eager to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan to make Japan nominally and formally an "independent" and "autonomous" country, so that after the signing of the treaty, the United States can immediately induce and coerce the reactionary traitorous government of this nominally "independent" and "autonomous" country to immediately conclude a military alliance or joint defense agreement with it, massively arm Japan, and enable Japanese troops to participate on a large scale in the US imperialist aggression against China and the conquest of Asia under the banner of the United Nations manipulated by US imperialism or under the cover of a possible "Pacific Pact." In this way, the United States can not only maintain its troops and all military bases in Japan, but also use the entire Japanese manpower and material resources as a stake in its war of aggression. This is the true intention of the US separate peace treaty with Japan, and it is also the main purpose of the US separate peace treaty with Japan.
    After this goal is achieved, not only will the US aggression against Korea and China continue to expand, but its attempts to enslave Asia and conquer the world will inevitably become more and more arrogant; not only will peace in the Far East be jeopardized, but the Third World War will inevitably get closer and closer.
    From the standpoint of the Chinese people, from the standpoint of a peace-loving nation, can we not resolutely oppose such a vicious and insidious act by the United States?
    From the above, it can be seen that the US separate peace treaty with Japan is not only an illegal act that violates international agreements and international practices, not only an unjust act that excludes China and undermines China, but also a preparatory act for it to expand aggression against China, undermine peace in the Far East, and launch a world war. It wants to drag the Japanese people onto the road of war and destruction, and it wants to drag China, Asia, and the whole world onto the road of war and destruction. This act seriously violates not only the interests of the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the Asian people, but also the interests of all peace-loving people in the world.
    Therefore, from the standpoint of all peace-loving people in the world, especially the standpoint of the Chinese people who are most closely related, we must resolutely oppose and severely attack this shameful collusion of the US separate peace treaty with Japan!

  Why We Should Strive for the Conclusion of a Comprehensive Peace Treaty with Japan
    A comprehensive peace treaty refers to a peace treaty that is jointly signed and concluded by all the Allied countries that fought against Japan. This treaty must of course have the participation of the two major countries that fought against Japan, China and the Soviet Union. With the participation of China and the Soviet Union, it will not violate or harm our interests. At the same time, we can also insist that the drafting procedure and the content of the clauses of the treaty must strictly abide by those declarations and agreements that have already been solemnly signed between the Allied countries, such as the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation...and so on.
    This comprehensive peace treaty jointly signed by the Allied countries is the most upright, legal, and reasonable. It not only conforms to international practice, but also brings the following many benefits:
    First, it can coordinate the interests of the Allied countries, and no country can monopolize or manipulate it. - A comprehensive peace treaty is a treaty agreed upon by all the Allied countries, so no country will take advantage of it alone, and no country will suffer particularly. It must be a fair and reasonable treaty. At the same time, in order to make everyone agree, its drafting must be based on those solemn documents that have been jointly agreed upon and jointly issued by the Allied countries since the war against Japan - the main ones being: (1) the Cairo Declaration issued on December 1, 1943; (2) the Yalta Agreement concluded on February 11, 1945; (3) the Potsdam Proclamation issued on July 26, 1945; (4) the "Basic Policy for Post-Surrender Japan" announced on June 20, 1947. These documents portray a clear outline for the future development of Japan, which can be used as a good design for formulating a peace treaty with Japan. However, for the purpose of selfishness and monopolizing Japan, the United States completely abandons this design, regards these solemn documents jointly signed by the Allied countries as waste paper, and insists on implementing its collusion for a separate peace treaty with Japan, and tries every possible means to prevent the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. This is an act of seriously undermining the interests of the Allied countries. Because of this, the people of the Allied countries, especially the Chinese people, must strive for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.
    Second, a comprehensive peace treaty can bring peace and democracy to Japan. - A comprehensive peace treaty must be a treaty formulated based on those solemn documents jointly signed by the Allied countries over the years (especially the four major documents mentioned above), we have already said this principle before. We don't need to quote the content of the clauses of those documents. Their basic principle is to transform Japan into a peaceful and democratic country. Therefore, Japan's armed forces must be abolished, military production must be destroyed, the aggressive forces of militarism must be eradicated, and war criminals and fascist elements must be rectified. At the same time, Japan's politics and economy must be democratized, and various freedoms and basic human rights must be guaranteed. On the one hand, these documents are to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism and prevent the Allied countries from being invaded by Japan again; but on the other hand, they are to guarantee the Japanese people so that they can live and work in peace and enjoy their peaceful and democratic lives, and no longer be deceived and driven by warlords and ambitious people. A comprehensive peace treaty formulated according to these principles is of course extremely beneficial to the vast Japanese people. At the same time, more importantly: precisely because a comprehensive peace treaty is a treaty that requires the agreement of all the Allied countries, any country can never be allowed to station troops or maintain military bases in Japan, and it is even less possible to be allowed to rearm Japan and use the Japanese people as its running dogs and cannon fodder. In this way, Japan's neutral status must be respected by all the Allied countries. Even if there are changes in the international situation in the future, its status can give it a greater guarantee of peace than any other country. From this point of view, a comprehensive peace treaty can bring true peace and democracy to Japan. A separate peace treaty will inevitably push Japan into war and destruction. We believe that except for a small handful of Japanese traitorous politicians and compradors, the general Japanese people all enthusiastically support the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty. Many reports from Japan are proving the correctness of this belief.
    Third, a comprehensive peace treaty can maintain peace in the Far East and prevent a world war. - We have already said that the main purpose of the US separate peace treaty with Japan is to massively arm Japan, pull Japan as its accomplice, so as to facilitate it to carry out its crazy attempt to continue to invade China, undermine peace in the Far East, and provoke a world war. Since a comprehensive peace treaty is a treaty that is jointly negotiated and agreed upon, of course, no country can hope that the treaty will allow it to station troops and maintain bases in Japan, and it is even less possible to hope to arm Japan and use the Japanese as its running dogs and cannon fodder. In this way, the United States' crazy attempt will inevitably be greatly hit. Everyone knows that the biggest weakness exposed by the United States in the Korean War is insufficient troops and insufficient manpower. The reason why it is so eager to arm West Germany in Europe and arm Japan in Asia is precisely to remedy this big weakness. If its attempt to arm Japan cannot be realized, its ambition to invade Asia and conquer the world, even if it will not be completely abandoned, will at least be eased. The peaceful settlement of the Far East issue and the world issue will be more hopeful. It is true that the development law of monopoly capitalism makes US imperialism have to engage in military adventures and have to run towards a world war. However, with the changes in the international situation and the growth of peace forces, the Third World War is not unavoidable. The avoidance of this war is of course enthusiastically welcomed by the people of the world.
    Fourth, a comprehensive peace treaty can enable China and Japan to live in harmony, trade, and mutually benefit. - "China and Japan are eternal enemies," this sentence is incorrect. The hatred between China and Japan is entirely caused by the past aggressive behavior of the Japanese imperialist ruling class; there is basically no hatred between the people of China and Japan. On the contrary, due to the geographical, historical, and cultural proximity of the two countries, China and Japan not only have the greatest possibility of living in harmony and helping each other, but also have the absolute necessity for peace in the Far East. We do not adopt narrow revanchism towards Japan. As long as Japan does not become an economic appendage and aggressive accomplice of US imperialism, the prospect of mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Japan can be encouraging and exciting. Everyone knows that Japan is a country with a fairly deep industrial foundation; China is a country with a vast land, abundant resources, and is moving towards industrialization. Cooperation between China and Japan is extremely beneficial to both countries. Before the war, Japan's exports always took China as its main target. At the same time, Japan's imports of iron ore, sticky coal, salt, and soybeans have always been supplied by China. The economic relations between the two countries are so close, so we often hear Japanese business people loudly shouting: "Without China, Japan simply cannot survive!" (Komakichi Matsuoka's words)
    Since the United States monopolized Japan, Sino-Japanese trade has already encountered difficulties. After the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, due to the US prohibition, this trade was almost completely cut off. Now the salt used by the Japanese has to be shipped in from the Red Sea, and the coal and iron ore used have to be imported from the Americas, and the purchase price is two to three times higher than importing from China. What a tragic phenomenon this is! If the US conspiracy for a separate peace treaty with Japan succeeds, Japan will become an economic appendage and aggressive accomplice of US imperialism, not only will Sino-Japanese trade relations be completely severed, but they will also inevitably meet on the battlefield again. This is the greatest misfortune for both countries!
    On the contrary, if a comprehensive peace treaty is concluded and Japan is established as a truly peaceful and democratic country, China and Japan will not only be able to live in peace, but the trade between the two countries will develop without limit. Especially the Chinese people, whose comprehensive land reform has been completed and whose purchasing power has been increased, their need for Japanese industrial products has greatly increased. At the same time, the consolidation of the Chinese people's power, the increase in grain production, and the development of resources have greatly increased the goods that China can provide to Japan. On the basis of mutual benefit and reciprocity without the interference of US imperialism, the large-scale development of Sino-Japanese trade will be of incalculable help to the reconstruction and construction of both countries.
    I believe that the Japanese people must have a thorough understanding of this simple truth. Therefore, I believe that except for a very few Japanese reactionary politicians and compradors who rely on US imperialism to get promoted and make a fortune, the vast Japanese people, like the Chinese people, are opposed to the US collusion for a separate peace treaty and support the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.

  The Great Significance of Signature Voting
    The World Peace Council is calling on the people of Japan, the people of Asia, the people of the Americas, and the people of all countries in Oceania related to Japan to hold a wide range of public opinion polls on issues such as opposing Japanese armament, opposing separate peace treaties, and striving for comprehensive peace treaties.
    The significance of this call is very significant. Because, through this vote, the true wishes of the vast masses of people in various countries in the world can be accurately, concretely, and powerfully expressed.
    Some people say: Imperialist war mongers are reckless and self-willed; they will not abandon their aggressive attempts or war plans because of our "signatures" or "votes." Then, isn't our signature voting a waste of effort?
    This understanding is incorrect. It ignores the power of the people. War mongers will certainly not automatically give up their crazy attempts, but under the pressure of huge people's power, they cannot be completely unscrupulous! Moreover, the most vicious and insidious trick of war mongers is to borrow public opinion, fabricate public opinion, and deceive the people. After the people's true wishes are accurately, concretely, and powerfully expressed, their despicable tricks cannot be used.
    As Marshal Stalin said: "The widespread movement to defend peace, as a tool to expose the sinister conspiracy of war mongers, now has the greatest significance." He also said: "If the people of all countries take up the cause of defending peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated."
    The widespread signature and voting campaign called for by the World Peace Council is precisely to "have the people of all countries take up the cause of defending peace." I believe that the peace-loving Chinese people, the Chinese people standing on the front line of defending peace, will surely enthusiastically respond to this great and solemn call!

### 反对美国单独对日媾和  争取缔结对日全面和约

专栏：

　　反对美国单独对日媾和
　  争取缔结对日全面和约
　　梅汝璈
　 响应世界和平理事会的伟大号召
    今年二月底世界和平理事会在柏林召开的第一届会议通过了十大决议案，其中最重要的两个是：
    （一）号召世界各国人民举行拥护要求五大国缔结和平公约宣言的签名；
    （二）号召日本以及亚洲、美洲和大洋洲的适当国家内，就日本问题，进行全国规模的民意投票。
    我国抗美援朝总会为了响应这个伟大号召，现在正在全国各地热烈发动着大规模的签名和投票运动。
    关于日本问题的投票，总会根据世界和平理事会决议案的启示，把它规定为下面两项：
    一、反对美国武装日本；反对美国单独对日媾和。
    二、主张签订全面的对日和约，促进日本人民的和平、民主。
    我今天要和大家谈论的只是对日和约问题。我要和大家解说的是：站在中国人民的立场，我们为什么要坚决地反对美国单独对日媾和？我们为什么要坚决地争取缔结全面对日和约？
  反对美国单独对日媾和
    让我们先谈为什么要反对美国单独对日媾和？
    单独对日媾和是美国自私自利、背信弃义的一个最毒辣最凶狠的阴谋。我们反对它的理由很多，其中最重要的有三个：
    第一，美国单独对日媾和是完全破坏国际协定、违背国际惯例的不法行为。
    大家都知道：对于怎样处置战败国的问题原是应该由各战胜同盟国举行和会、共同磋商、缔结全面和约来解决的。古今国际惯例，都是如此。美国的单独对日媾和是它完全藐视这个国际惯例、史无先例的荒谬行为。同时，它也是破坏国际协定的行为，因为在一九四二年一月一日中、苏、美、英、澳、印、加等二十六国华盛顿宣言上明明白白规定了“每一政府承允与本宣言签字国政府国合作，并不与敌国缔结单独停战协定与和约”。根据一九四五年八月三日波茨坦宣言和一九四五年十二月三国外长莫斯科会议决议的精神，对战败国的和约应由外长会议共同起草，保持大国一致的原则。现在美国完全不顾这些国际间的庄严协定，独断独行，硬要单独和日本订立双边和约，并威胁利诱其他盟国也个别地去加入这种和约。它连形式上的和会都不打算举行。对于美国这种专横武断、荒谬绝伦的不法行为，我们还能不坚决反对吗？
    第二，美国单独对日媾和是排斥中国参加，并破坏中国利益的行为。
    在击败日本帝国主义战争里，中国是一个主要的力量。我们艰苦抗战，历时八年，把日本深深地拖入泥沼。在这八年之中，我们的牺牲浩大：生命损失在一千万人以上，财产损失价值超过五百万万美元。我们在抗日战争中的贡献和牺牲既是这样浩大，在对日和约中我们当然应该有充份的发言权。但是美国今天单独对日媾和的阴谋却完全置我们于不理。它不但不顾苏联的抗议，依法召集四国外长会议来共同起草，不但不召集同盟国对日和会来共同讨论，而且连他的单独和约草案送都不送一份给新中国人民政府。这可证明它是完全要排斥我们参加。不但如此，而且据我们所知，它的对日和约草案的条款内容还严重损害着中国的利益。例如：依照开罗宣言和波茨坦公告，台湾毫无疑问地是中国的领土。但是美国单独对日和约草案上对于台湾归还中国却故意一字不提。这不过是一个例子而已。此外，美国草案中损害我们利益的地方还多着呢！
    美国单独对日和约不但根本排斥中国的参加而且处处损害着中国的利益，这是美国丧尽天良、不法不义的行为。对于这个行为，我们对日八年浴血抗战、牺牲惨重的中国人民还能不坚决反对吗？
    第三，我们反对美国单独对日媾和更重要的理由是：美国单独对日媾和是准备扩大侵略中国、破坏远东和平、挑起世界大战的行为。
    大家都知道：美国单独对日媾和的目的，一方面固然是要使它近六年来独占日本所非法取得的经济上政治上和军事上种种权益条约化、合法化、永久化，尤其是要保持它在日本的驻军权和许多海空军基地。但更重要的另一方面却是要大规模武装日本，要日本人做帮凶、当炮灰。不错，美国武装日本早已开始，变相的日本陆海空军已经成立，而且在侵朝战争中日本帮凶起了相当的作用。但是在没有签订和约的占领时期，明目张胆地武装日本或大规模地派遣日本部队到海外作战，那究竟是不太方便的事情。因此，美国急急于要单独与日本签订和约，使日本在名义上形式上成为一个“独立”“自主”的国家，以便在签订和约之后，美国便马上可以诱胁这个名义上“独立”“自主”国家的反动卖国政府和它立即缔结一个军事同盟或联防协定之类，把日本大量武装起来，使日本部队能在美帝国主义操纵的联合国旗帜下，或可能成立的“太平洋公约”掩护下，大规模地去参加美帝国主义侵略中国、征服亚洲的行动。这样一来，美国不但可以保持它在日本的驻军和一切军事基地，而且还可以利用整个日本的人力物力做它侵略战争的赌注。这是美国单独对日媾和的真正用意，也是美国单独对日媾和的主要目的。
    这个目的达到以后，不但美国对朝鲜、中国的侵略会继续扩大，而且它的奴役亚洲和征服世界的企图必定更加一日狂妄一日；不但远东和平不保，而且第三次世界大战必定更加一日接近一日。
    站在中国人民的立场，站在一个爱好和平的民族立场，我们对美国这样毒辣阴险的行为，能够不坚决反对吗？
    由以上看来，美国单独对日媾和不仅是违反国际协定和国际惯例的不法行为，不仅是排斥中国和破坏中国的不义行为，而且是它要扩大侵略中国、破坏远东和平和掀起世界大战的准备行为。它要把日本人民拖到战争和毁灭的道路上去，它要把中国、亚洲、以及全世界拖到战争和破坏的道路上去。这个行为不但严重地违反中国人民、日本人民和亚洲人民的利益，而且严重地违反全世界爱好和平人民的利益。
    所以，站在全世界爱好和平人民的立场，尤其是关系最密切的中国人民的立场，我们对于美国单独对日媾和这个可耻的勾当必须予以坚决的反对、严厉的打击！
  我们为什么要争取缔结对日全面和约
    全面和约是指全体对日作战的同盟国大家共同来签订来缔结的和约。这个和约当然必须有对日作战的两大主要国家，中国和苏联的参加。既有中苏两国参加，它就不致违反或损害我们的利益。同时，我们还可以坚持和约的拟订程序和条款内容必须严格遵守同盟国间所已经郑重签订的那些宣言和协定，如开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告……之类。
    这样由盟国共同签订的对日全面和约是最正大光明、最合法合理的。它不但符合国际惯例，而且可以带来下列的许多好处：
    第一、它可以使同盟国间的利益获得协调，任何一国不能把持操纵。——全面和约既是同盟国间大家同意的和约，那一国也不会独占便宜，那一国也不会特别吃亏。它必然是一个公平合理的和约。同时，因为要使大家同意，他的拟订就必须根据于同盟国间自对日开战以来迭次共同同意、共同发表的那些庄严文件——其中主要的是：（一）一九四三年十二月一日发表的开罗宣言；（二）一九四五年二月十一日订立的雅尔达协定；（三）一九四五年七月二十六日发表的波茨坦公告；（四）一九四七年六月二十日公布的“对投降后日本之基本政策”。这些文件对于未来日本的发展描绘了一个清晰的轮廓，可以当做制订对日和约的一个良好图案。但是美国为了自私自利、独霸日本的目的，却完全舍弃这个图案于不顾，把盟国间历次共同签订的这些庄严文件视若废纸，一意孤行，要贯彻它对日单独媾和的勾当，并且千方百计阻止着对日全面和约的缔结。这是严重破坏同盟国利益的行为。惟其如此，各同盟国的人民，特别是中国人民，必须争取缔结对日全面和约。
    第二、全面和约可以给日本带来和平民主。——对日全面和约必定是一个根据同盟国间历年共同签订的那些庄严文件（尤其是前面所举的那四大文件）而制订的和约，这道理我们前面已经说过了。那些文件的条款内容，我们不必多事援引。它们的基本原则却是要把日本改造成为一个和平民主的国家。因此，日本的武装军备必须废除，军需生产必须摧毁，军国主义的侵略势力必须铲除，战犯法西斯分子必须整肃。同时，日本的政治经济必须民主化，各种自由和基本人权必须获得保障。这些文件一方面固然是要防止日本军国主义的复活，使同盟国不致再受日本侵略；但另一方面却是要保证日本人民，使他们能够安居乐业，度其和平民主的生活，不再受军阀野心家的蒙蔽和驱使。根据这些原则来制订的全面和约，对于日本广大人民当然是极端有利的。同时，更重要的是：正惟全面和约是一个需要各同盟国大家同意的和约，所以，任何一国决不可能被允许在日本驻扎军队或保持军事基地，更不可能被允许重新武装日本，利用日本人民做鹰犬、当炮灰。这样，日本的中立地位必为各盟国所尊重。纵使国际间异日有变乱发生，它的这种地位也可以使它得到和平保障比任何国家都大。由此看来，全面和约才能给日本带来真正的和平民主。单独和约必定把日本推入战争和毁灭。我们相信：除了一小撮日本卖国政客和买办之外，一般的日本人民大众都是热烈拥护缔结全面和约的。许多来自日本的报道，正在证明这个信念的正确。
    第三、全面和约可以维持远东和平、防止世界大战。——我们已经说过：美国单独对日媾和的主要目的是在大规模武装日本，拉日本做它的帮凶，以便利它去执行其继续侵略中国、破坏远东和平和挑起世界大战的狂妄企图。全面和约既是大家共同协商而同意签订的和约，当然任何一国都不能希望和约会允许它在日本驻扎军队、保持基地，更不能希望武装日本，用日本人做它的鹰犬、当它的炮灰。这样一来，美国的狂妄企图必定要受到大大的打击。大家都知道：在朝鲜战争中，美国所暴露的最大弱点是兵力不足、人力不足。它之所以急急于要在欧洲武装西德、在亚洲武装日本，也正是为了要补救这个大弱点。倘使它武装日本的企图不能实现，它的侵略亚洲和征服世界的野心，纵使不会根本放弃，至少也会和缓下来。远东问题和世界问题的和平解决便更加有希望。诚然，独占资本主义的发展规律使美帝国主义不能不从事于军事冒险，不能不奔向于世界大战。但是随着国际形势的变化和和平力量的增长，第三次世界大战并不是不能避免的。这种战争的避免当然是全世界人民所热烈欢迎的。
    第四，全面和约可以使中日两国和睦相处，通商互利。——“中日两国是世仇”，这句话是不正确的。中日间的仇恨完全是以往日本帝国主义统治阶级的侵略行为所造成；中日两国人民之间基本上并无仇恨之可言。相反地、由于两国地理上历史上和文化上的接近，中日不但有和睦相处、互助合作的最大可能，而且为了远东和平、还有其绝对必要。我们对日本并不采取狭隘的报复主义。只要日本不沦为美帝国主义的经济附庸和侵略帮凶，中日两国互助合作的远景是可以令人鼓舞兴奋的。大家都知道：日本是一个有相当深厚工业基础的国家；中国是一个地大物博资源丰富、而且正在走向工业化的国家。中日的合作对两国都是极端有利的。在战前，日本的输出一向是以中国为其主要对象。同时，日本的铁矿石、粘煤、盐和大豆的输入，一向是仰给于中国。两国经济关系既如此密切，所以我们常听见日本工商界人士高声疾呼：“脱离了中国，日本简直不能够生存下去！”（松冈驹吉语）
    自从美国独占日本以来，中日贸易早已发生困难。美国发动侵朝战争以后，由于美国的禁止，这种贸易几乎全部陷于断绝。现在日本人用的盐要从红海运进，用的煤和铁石要从美洲输入，其购进价格要比从中国输入者高到两倍至三倍。这是何等悲惨的现象！倘使美国单独对日媾和的阴谋得逞，日本沦为美帝国主义的经济附庸和侵略帮凶，不但中日贸易关系将要完全断绝，而且还不免又要兵戎相见，角逐战场。这对于两国说来都是最大不幸！
    反之，倘使缔结全面和约，日本建立为真正和平民主的国家，中日不但能够和平相处，而且两国之间的通商贸易是会无限量地发展的。尤其是全面土地改革完成、购买力提高了的中国人民，他们对于日本工业制成品的需要已经大大地增大了。同时，中国人民政权的巩固，粮食增产、资源开展，使中国能够提供日本的货物也大大地增加了。在不受美帝国主义干涉的互惠互利基础上，中日贸易的大量发展，对于两国之复兴建设的帮助是不可限量的。
    我相信：日本人民对于这个简单的真理必定有彻底的认识。因此，我相信：除了极少数靠美帝国主义升官发财的日本反动政客和买办以外，广大的日本人民，正如中国人民一样，对于美国单独媾和的勾当都是反对的，对于缔结对日全面和约都是赞成的。
  签名投票的重大意义
    世界和平理事会正在号召日本人民、亚洲人民、美洲人民、以及大洋洲一切对日有关国家的人民，就反对日本武装、反对单独媾和、争取全面和约等问题举行广泛的民意投票。
    这个号召的意义是非常重大的。因为，通过这个投票，世界各国广大民众的真正意愿可以确切地具体地并有力地表现出来。
    有人说：帝国主义战争贩子是不顾一切、一意孤行的；他们并不会因为我们的“签名”或“投票”而放弃其侵略企图或战争计划。那末，我们的签名投票岂不是白费工夫吗？
    这种认识是不正确的。它忽视了人民的力量。战争贩子固然不会自动放弃其疯狂企图，但在巨大人民力量的压力之下，他们却不能完全无所顾忌！况且战争贩子最毒辣最阴险的伎俩便是假借民意、伪造民意、欺骗人民。在人民真正意愿确切地、具体地、并有力地表现之后，他们这种卑鄙伎俩便无法得施了。
    正如斯大林大元帅所说：“广泛的维护和平的运动，作为揭露战争贩子罪恶阴谋的工具，现在具有最重大的意义。”他又说：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。”
    现在世界和平理事会所号召的广泛签名和投票运动，正是要“各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来”。我相信：爱好和平的中国人民、站在保卫和平前线的中国人民、必定都会热烈响应这个伟大庄严的号召！
