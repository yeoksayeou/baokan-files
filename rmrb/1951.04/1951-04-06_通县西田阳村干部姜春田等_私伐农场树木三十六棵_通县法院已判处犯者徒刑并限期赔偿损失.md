    Village Cadres Jiang Chuntian and Others from Xitianyang Village, Tong County, Privately Felled Thirty-Six Trees from the Farm
    Tong County Court Has Sentenced the Offenders to Imprisonment and Ordered Compensation for Losses Within a Time Limit
    To the Editor:
    The Tong County Farm has over two hundred mu of land and one hundred sixty to seventy poplar and willow trees in Xitianyang Village, Seventh District, Tong County. Unexpectedly, nearly forty of these trees were privately felled by the village on December 19th of last year. Some of them have already been transported to Beijing and sold. According to our investigation, the masterminds behind this action were the village cadres Jiang Chuntian and Shen Tianxi. We believe that such an open and forceful act of stealing state property should be duly punished.
            Tong County Farm, Hebei Province

    Editor's Note: According to our investigation, the situation reflected by the Tong County Farm is true. The Tong County People's Court has already dealt with this matter. The felling of the farm's trees by village cadres Jiang Chuntian and Shen Tianxi of Xitianyang Village is a continuation of their consistently corrupt and wasteful behavior, involving feasting, drinking, and gambling. According to Jiang and Shen's own admissions, the following facts exist:

    From the spring of 1949 to October of the same year, Jiang, Shen, and others successively stole and sold 117 jin of public grain rice, 12 shi of corn, and 5 shi of white and black beans; and embezzled 10 shi of soybeans collected as excess public grain and 1,200 jin of horse feed returned by the People's Liberation Army borrowed from the village. To satisfy their corrupt and wasteful behavior, Jiang, Shen, and others even abandoned their principles and encroached upon the fruits of victory of the peasants.

    Last December, Jiang, Shen, and others, under the pretext of building a school, convened a mass meeting and called for the felling of the farm's trees in the area. They said, "It's a waste not to dig them up," and also said, "Anyone who doesn't agree is a reactionary," and forcibly passed a resolution, led by Jiang, Shen, and others, on the 19th of the same month, leading many people to fell thirty-six trees from the farm. They were later transported to Beijing and sold, earning more than 3.9 million RMB, of which Jiang, Shen, and others immediately spent more than 1.6 million RMB.

    Based on Jiang Chuntian and Shen Tianxi's consistent illegal behavior, the Tong County People's Court has sentenced Jiang Chuntian to three years of imprisonment and Shen Tianxi to one year of imprisonment; and ordered them to recover the embezzled funds within a time limit and compensate the farm for the trees.

    通县西田阳村干部姜春田等
    私伐农场树木三十六棵
    通县法院已判处犯者徒刑并限期赔偿损失编辑同志：
    通县农场在通县七区西田阳村有二百多亩土地和一百六、七十棵杨、柳树。没想到，这些树木竟于去年十二月十九日被该村私自伐倒近四十棵。其中有一部分已经被他们运到北京卖了。据我们调查，这一行动的主使者是该村干部姜春田和沈天禧。对这种公开强行盗卖国家财物的行为，我们认为应该予以必要的惩处。

    编者按：据本报调查，通县农场所反映的情况是真实的。通县人民法院对此事已予处理。西田阳村村干部姜春田、沈天禧带人砍伐农场树林，是他们一贯贪污自肥、吃喝、赌博等恶劣作风的继续发展。据姜、沈二人亲口承认的，就有如下事实：
    一九四九年春至同年十月间，姜、沈等先后盗卖公粮米一百一十七斤、玉米十二石、白黑豆五石；并贪污了多征公粮黄豆十石及人民解放军归还借用村中的马料一千二百斤。为了满足他们贪污腐化的行为，姜、沈等人竟然丧失立场，侵占农民的胜利果实。
    去年十二月，姜、沈等又以建筑学校为名，召开群众大会，号召砍伐该地农场林木。他们说：“不刨也是白不刨”，还说：“谁不赞成谁是反动派”，并强作决议，由姜、沈等为首，于同月十九日率领群众多人，砍伐农场树木三十六棵。后运到北京出卖，共卖得人民币三百九十余万元，姜、沈等即用去一百六十余万元。
    根据姜春田和沈天禧一贯的违法行为，通县人民法院已判处姜春田三年徒刑，沈天禧一年徒刑；并限期追还贪污款项，赔偿农场树木。
