Struggle for Universal Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Movement

　　How to Deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement Among Rural Women
　　Ma Shufang, Ping Quan, Su Qun

Since the Tangshan Special District of Hebei Province universally launched the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement during last year's October Revolution anniversary, the broad masses of rural women have enthusiastically participated in the movement, demonstrating a high degree of patriotic fervor. At the beginning of the movement, women cadres at all levels throughout the special district universally studied the relevant documents on resisting America and aiding Korea, participated in the leadership organizations of the sub-committees of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, and unified the propaganda forces of Party members and non-Party women. With the development of the entire movement—from urban areas to rural areas, from plains to mountains—a comprehensive propaganda movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend the home and country gradually unfolded. After three months, preliminary experiences have been gained on how to mobilize rural women to participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement:

First, it is necessary to constantly study the ideological trends of the rural women, organize a certain number of women to participate in the propaganda work, and conduct propaganda and education focusing on their questions and concerns. In some districts of Changli and Fengnan counties, a certain number of women cadres, Party members, Youth League members, teachers, and students were assigned to the propaganda teams during the propaganda process; and, in response to the backward thinking of some women who believed that "old women are useless" and were unwilling to participate in political activities, the propaganda content and methods were discussed in advance. As a result, the enthusiasm of women to participate in political activities was enhanced, and the situation of having more men than women at meetings was overcome. In the 7th District of Fengnan County, more than 3,200 women participated in a mass rally of 4,000 people. They spoke on stage and paraded in demonstrations, resolutely expressing that they would not lag behind men in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. In Zhangzhuang Village in the 8th District of Linyu County, more than 30 women spontaneously formed a women's propaganda team, focusing on propaganda to women and also to men, ensuring the balanced development of political awareness among the men and women in the village.

Second, more literary and artistic activities should be organized for propaganda. Rural women, especially older women, generally have low levels of education and little understanding of political issues. When attending large meetings and listening to lectures, they cannot understand uncommon phrases. Even if they remember something, they quickly forget it. In response to this situation, various places have adopted propaganda methods such as open-air plays, Yangko dances, and cartoons, which are very popular among women. Some old women in the 3rd District of Fengrun County did not remember anything after listening to several lectures. However, after watching the open-air play "Atrocities of the American Imperialists" at the district government and seeing the scene in the play where a Korean woman was stabbed to death by American soldiers, and her child was still crawling on her chest to nurse, they could never forget it. Whenever they thought about it, they angrily cursed the American army as murdering robbers. Liang Shuying, a model worker in Linyu County, bought several picture books exposing the atrocities of American imperialism and circulated them among the women in her village. Because they could understand them, they became very interested, quickly arousing the women's enthusiastic support for the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.

Third, to consolidate the women's emotional hatred of American imperialism and continue to improve their political awareness, it is necessary to call on women to enter winter schools and farmers' spare-time schools, and at the same time strengthen the regular propaganda work of propagandists to women. According to statistics from nine counties including Zunhua, Lulong, Funing, Leting, Qian'an, Luanxian, Qianxi, Linyu, and Yutian, the 40,980 women participating in winter schools have mostly completed the booklet "Mobilize to Resist America and Aid Korea" compiled and printed by the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China under the teaching principle of emphasizing both culture and current affairs. And began to study the supplementary teaching material "Defeat American Imperialist Aggressors". With the progress of the course and the evolution of the Korean War situation, the political awareness of the enrolled women has been further improved. The national inferiority complex of many women has begun to be eliminated, and their national self-esteem and self-confidence have increased unprecedentedly.

However, there are still relatively serious shortcomings in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement among rural women in Tangshan Special District. The main problem is that the propaganda and education departments at all levels have not paid due attention to propaganda to women, thinking that propaganda to women is only the business of the Democratic Women's Federation; some cadres of the Democratic Women's Federation in some counties and districts even believe that propaganda to women is a temporary task and lack a serious and regular propaganda plan. At the same time, the work of current affairs propaganda has not been combined with mobilizing women to participate in production and solving the problems of women's immediate interests, so that the phenomenon of unbalanced and unsustained development of the movement has not been corrected; the scope of women's participation in the patriotic movement is still limited to a few activists and cannot be more widely developed.

　　怎样将抗美援朝运动深入到农村妇女中去
    马淑芳、平权、苏群
    河北唐山专区自去年十月革命节普遍开展抗美援朝运动以来，广大农村妇女踊跃地投入了运动，表现了高度的爱国热情。运动开始时，全专区各级妇女干部普遍学习了抗美援朝的有关文件，参加了中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会各分会的领导机构，统一了党内外妇女群众的宣传力量。随着整个运动的发展——由城镇到农村，由平原到山地，逐渐展开了全面的抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传运动。历时三个月之久，已获得如何发动农村妇女参加抗美援朝运动的初步经验：
    第一，必须时刻研究农村妇女群众的思想动态，组织一定数量的妇女参加宣传工作，针对她们的疑问和顾虑，进行宣传教育。昌黎、丰南两县有些区，在进行宣传时，都在宣传队伍中配备了一定数量的妇女干部、党员、团员、教员和学生；并针对一些妇女存在的“老娘们不顶事”，不愿参加政治活动的落后思想，事先讨论好宣传内容与方式方法。这样做的结果，提高了妇女们参加政治活动的热情，克服了开会时男多女少的情况。丰南县第七区在四千人的群众大会上，竟有三千二百多名妇女参加。她们登台讲话，游行示威，坚决表示在抗美援朝运动中不落在男人之后。临榆县第八区张庄三十多名妇女，自动组成了妇女宣传队，除着重对妇女进行宣传外，并向男子宣传，保证了本村男女群众政治觉悟的平衡发展。
    第二，多组织文艺活动进行宣传。农村妇女特别是老年妇女，一般的是文化水平低，对政治问题了解得少，在参加大会听讲时，一遇到不通俗的语句即弄不明白，即或记住一点，也会很快忘掉。针对这一情况，各地采取了广场剧、秧歌舞、漫画等宣传方法，很受妇女群众的欢迎。丰润县三区有些村的老大娘，听了好几次讲演，都没有记清，但在区政府看了《美帝暴行》的广场剧，看到剧中一个朝鲜妇女被美军用刺刀扎死，孩子还爬在她胸前吃奶的情节后，却总也忘不了，想起来就愤怒地大骂美军是杀人强盗。临榆县劳动模范梁淑英，买了几本揭露美帝国主义暴行的小人书，给本村妇女传看。因为她们看得懂，就发生很大兴趣，很快地引起了妇女们对抗美援朝运动的热烈拥护。
    第三，要把妇女从感情上对美帝国主义的仇视情绪巩固起来，并继续提高她们的政治觉悟，这样就必须号召妇女进入冬学和农民业余学校，同时加强宣传员对妇女的经常宣传工作。据遵化、卢龙、抚宁、乐亭、迁安、滦县、迁西、临榆、玉田九个县的统计，参加冬学的四万零九百八十名妇女，在文化和时事并重的教学原则下，大都学完了中国共产党河北省委员会宣传部编印的《动员起来，抗美援朝》的小册子，并开始在学习《打败美帝国主义侵略者》的补充教材。随着课程的进展和朝鲜战局的演变，入学妇女的政治觉悟得到进一步的提高。好些妇女的民族自卑心理，已在开始消除，民族自尊心、自信心已空前增长。
    但目前唐山专区农村妇女抗美援朝运动还存在着比较严重的缺点，主要是各级宣传教育部门还没有对向妇女宣传引起应有的重视，以为向妇女进行宣传只是民主妇女联合会的事；甚至有些县、区民主妇女联合会的干部，也认为对妇女宣传是一个临时性的工作，缺乏认真的和经常的宣传计划。同时，在宣传中还没有能做到时事宣传工作与发动妇女参加生产、解决妇女切身利益问题结合进行，致使运动发展不平衡、不深入的现象未能得到纠正；妇女们参加爱国运动的范围还停留在部分积极分子中间，得不到更广泛的开展。
