　　Chinese People's Volunteer Medical Personnel Fighting in Korea
　　By our reporter, Rong An
　　On the Korean battlefield, the Chinese People's Volunteer medical workers are fighting as bravely as the Chinese People's Volunteer soldiers. Under the constant harassment of enemy planes day and night, they use their lives and blood to treat and care for the wounded soldiers heroically fighting on the front lines.

　　When the Chinese People's Volunteers entered Korea and inflicted devastating blows on the American invading forces in the first and second campaigns, the enemy frantically bombed and strafed cities and villages from the front to the rear, day and night, in a desperate struggle. Therefore, rescuing and protecting the wounded in dangerous situations has become the primary task of the medical workers. When a certain medical station was in Sanpo-ri, it was bombed by enemy planes. A head nurse sacrificed her precious life in order to rescue the last of seventeen wounded soldiers who had not yet escaped the danger. The second unit of a certain People's Volunteer Army field hospital encountered enemy aircraft harassment while transferring wounded soldiers on November 8th of last year. At that time, there were still four seriously wounded soldiers who had not been carried down from the train. Head Nurse and Communist Party member, Comrade Che Jiqian, fearlessly rushed into the strafing zone to rescue the wounded soldiers, and called on everyone, saying, "Communist Party members, follow me!" Then, nursing staff Zhao Jun, Yu Chengxin, Chen Yunling and other comrades rushed forward and rescued the four seriously wounded soldiers, carrying them to a safe place. When the unit was near Heecheon, it was attacked by fifteen enemy planes in one day, which dropped many incendiary bombs. The wounded soldiers' houses were about to be burned. The lightly wounded soldiers found places to hide, but eight seriously wounded soldiers who could not move were threatened by enemy planes. Zhang Baoxiang, the logistics officer of the unit, led everyone to rush into the ward to rescue them; some of the staff members participating in the rescue had their clothes ignited by the incendiary bombs, so they quickly took off their clothes and entered the ward bare-chested, quickly transferring the eight seriously wounded soldiers to a safe place to hide.

　　When the reporter interviewed a certain field hospital, the hospital had been subjected to enemy air raids for four consecutive days. Every staff member of the hospital, regardless of the threat of enemy planes, continued to work as usual. The doctors continued to diagnose on time, and the nurses took extra care to care for the wounded soldiers. When nursing staff encountered enemy planes on the way to fetch water and food, they hid on the spot, and after the enemy planes passed, they quickly delivered the water and food to the wards. Even during the frenzied strafing by enemy planes, the staff did not leave the wards for a moment. They guarded these heroes who were wounded for human justice with a spirit of great revolutionary friendship.

　　The Chinese People's Volunteer medical personnel working in Korea have exhausted all means to overcome the difficulties in their work. In order to quickly transfer and treat the sick and wounded, a certain field hospital launched a "Five Quick" movement: 1. The wounded enter the house quickly, 2. Eating quickly, 3. Registration and reissuance of bedding quickly, 4. Handling transfer and organizational procedures quickly, 5. Treatment and examination quickly. In his personal merit plan, a nursing orderly, Li Huiqing, wrote: First, ensure that the wounded eat and drink well, second, be diligent in ironing, washing, and mending to ensure that lice do not bite the wounded, third, take care of the sick and wounded carefully, fourth, do not leave the ward under any circumstances during work, fifth, ensure the cleanliness of the ward, and strive to join the New Democratic Youth League in this merit movement.

　　Encouraged by the glorious call to perform meritorious service for the people, all the staff of the hospital displayed outstanding creativity, and many excellent model workers emerged. Operating room nurses used substitutes to make sterilizers and warming equipment. Wang Lianshun, a correspondent from one unit, saw that rolling bandages in the operating room was too laborious, so he devised a hand-cranked bandage rolling machine, which allowed one person to replace the work of three people. Due to a lack of bedpans and urinals in the wards, the nursing staff used discarded canned food containers instead, maintaining the cleanliness of the wards. Nurse Xia Guangdi, once accepted a task and persisted in working for six days and six nights without sleep. Nursing orderly Luo Kexian cared for a wounded soldier suffering from tetanus. When his condition was serious, he had to be fed boiled water every three minutes; sometimes the patient could not eat on time, so he made food for the patient himself. Not only did he not leave the ward during working hours, but when the staff went to eat, he stayed alone outside the ward, and as soon as he heard a sound from the house, he immediately went in to ask what was wrong. Li Fengyu, a seventeen-year-old Korean female nursing orderly, cared for six wards and twenty-five seriously wounded soldiers alone. In addition to her daily work, she ironed and washed all the underwear of all the sick and wounded soldiers within a week. Their spirit of work moved every sick and wounded soldier, who asked the hospital authorities to give them credit.

　　The selfless spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteer medical workers on the Korean battlefield has brought infinite comfort and encouragement to the sick and wounded soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army who are fighting for peace. In the just struggle to resist America and aid Korea, they have made great contributions.

　　战斗在朝鲜的中国人民
　  志愿援朝医务人员

    在朝鲜战场上，中国人民志愿援朝的医务工作者，和中国人民志愿军战士一样英勇地战斗着。在敌机日夜不停地扰乱的情况下，他们用自己的生命和鲜血医疗和护理着在前线上英勇负伤的战士们。
    当中国人民志愿军进入朝鲜，在第一和第二次战役中，给美国侵略军以毁灭性的打击以后，敌人就不分昼夜，对前方与后方的城市、乡村进行着疯狂的轰炸与扫射，以作垂死的挣扎。因之，在危险的情况下抢救和保护伤员，就成了医务工作者的首要任务。某医务所在三浦里时，遭到敌机轰炸。一位护士长为了抢救十七名伤员中的最后一名尚未脱险的伤员，牺牲了他宝贵的生命。人民志愿军某部兵站医院第二所，于去年十一月八日转运伤员时，遭到了敌机的袭扰。当时在车站上还有四名重伤员没有抬下来。护士长共产党员车骥千同志，奋不顾身，首先冲入扫射圈内抢救伤员，并号召大家说：“共产党员跟我来！”接着就有护理员赵君、于成辛、陈云龄等同志，一拥而上，把四名重伤员抢救下来，抬到了安全的地方。该所在熙川附近某地时，在一个白天里，有十五架敌机来袭，投下了不少烧夷弹，眼看伤员的房子被燃着了。轻伤员们找地方隐蔽了起来，有八名不能行动的重伤员，受着敌机的威胁。该所事务长张保祥同志，带领大家冲入病室抢救；有些参加抢救的工作人员的衣服被烧夷弹燃着了，他们就迅速脱下衣服，赤着膀子进入病室，将八名重伤员迅速地转移到安全的地方隐蔽了起来。
    记者在某兵站医院采访时，该院曾连续四天遭受敌机的袭扰。医院的每个工作人员，都不顾敌机的威胁，照常坚持工作。医生们照例按时地进行诊断，护士们格外细心地照顾伤员。护理员同志打水打饭走到中途遇到敌机时，便就地隐蔽，待敌机过去，立即迅速地把水和饭送到病房里去。甚至在敌机疯狂扫射时，工作人员也没有片刻离开病房。他们是以伟大的革命友爱精神，守护着这些为人类正义而负伤的英雄们。
    在朝鲜工作的中国人民志愿援朝的医疗人员，用尽了各种办法克服着工作中的困难。某兵站医院为了迅速地转运和治疗伤病员，开展了五快运动：一、伤员来了进房子快，二、吃饭快，三、登记和补发被服快，四、办理转运组织手续快，五、治疗、检查快。在个人立功计划书中，一个护理员李惠清这样写着：一，保证伤员吃好、喝好，二、做到勤烫、勤洗、勤缝补，保证不叫虱子咬着伤员，三、细心照顾伤病员，四、在工作时任何情况下不离病室，五、保证病室的卫生清洁，并要争取在这次立功运动中加入新民主主义青年团。
    在为人民立功的光荣号召的鼓舞下，全院工作人员发挥了卓越的创造精神，并涌现出不少优秀的模范工作者。手术室护士们用代用品制造了消毒器和保暖设备。一所通讯员王连顺，看到手术室卷绷带太费工，他就想办法做了一个卷绷带的手摇机，一个人可以代替三个人的工作。病房缺乏大小便器，护理员同志就用废罐头筒来代替，保持了病室的卫生清洁。护士夏光第，有一次接受任务后，曾经六天六夜不眠不休地坚持工作。护理员罗克贤，护理着一位患破伤风的伤员，当病情严重时，每隔三分钟就要喂一次开水；有时患者不能够按时吃饭，他就自己给患者做饭吃。他不仅在工作时间不离开病房，而且在工作人员开饭的时候，别人都去吃饭了，他还一个人留在病房外边，一听到那个房子有叫唤的声音，就马上进去问长问短。十七岁的朝鲜女护理员李逢玉，一个人护理着六个病室、二十五个重伤员，除了日常工作外，在一个礼拜内，她把全部伤病员的内衣都烫洗了。他们这种工作精神，感动了每个伤病员同志，都纷纷要求医院当局给他们立功。
    中国人民志愿援朝的医疗工作者在朝鲜战场上这种忘我的工作精神，使为和平而战的中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军的伤病员们得到无限的安慰与鼓舞。在抗美援朝的正义斗争中，他们已做出了伟大的贡献。
