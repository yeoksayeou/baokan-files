Nationwide, over 1.2 million people are now participating in organized railway protection efforts, effectively assisting railway public security personnel in ensuring the safety of railway transport. Many railway protection models and exemplary deeds have continuously emerged in the railway protection movement across various regions. In Jining County, Suiyuan Province, the Mongolian and Han residents of Nanfangzi Village, under the leadership of Zhang Zhongyi, director of the local railway protection committee, enthusiastically participated in railway protection work, ensuring "uninterrupted service, regardless of wind or rain." Since the Kangkou Public Security Station of the Shangrao Public Security Section of the Shanghai Railway Administration mobilized residents to protect the railway last June, no railway equipment has been lost in its jurisdiction. The model railway protection village on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, Chasuqi Village in Suiyuan Province, its railway protection militia defeated a group of bandits on December 25th last year, ensuring the safe and punctual passage of trains. In Yanggao County, Chahar Province, the railway protection militia of the Ninth District arrested bandit leader Xiong Fugui and 10 others in Wujiabao, and cooperated with the Public Security Section to wipe out Wang Diange's eleven bandits.
