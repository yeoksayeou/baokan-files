Why Appropriate Attention Should Be Paid to Increasing the Production of Chinese Cotton
    Zang Chengyao

    In 1950, Chinese cotton accounted for 30% of the total cotton harvested area nationwide. The main production areas were the Yangtze River cotton region, followed by the Yellow River cotton region and the northern part of the Northeast cotton region. By province and region: Chinese cotton area in northern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, and Sichuan accounted for about 80% of the total cotton field area in the province. In northern Jiangsu and Hunan, Chinese cotton accounted for about 40% of the total cotton field area. In Hubei and Zhejiang, it was about 30%. There are three reasons why the masses grow Chinese cotton: First, it matures early, suitable for double cropping and areas with shorter frost-free periods. Second, it is more convenient to use for hand spinning, wadding raw materials, and cotton ginning. Third, it requires less labor to plant and is more resistant to insects. Currently, Chinese cotton has two uses: First, it is needed for hand spinning and wadding. Second, it is used as raw material for machine spinning yarn of 16 counts or less; the former accounts for the majority, and the latter is used less. After the liberation of mainland China, transportation has been restored, coupled with last year's bumper harvest, the purchasing power of the masses has generally increased, and they are making up for the shortage of clothing and bedding caused by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang rule. Therefore, the demand for wadding has increased, the demand for cotton cloth has increased, and the rural homespun cloth industry has also recovered. For example, Yao flower Chinese cotton from Zhejiang sells very well in Fujian. Hubei's Yunmeng homespun cloth used to sell well in the Northwest; it had declined from the Anti-Japanese War to 1949, but this year it is being sold far to Inner Mongolia and Gansu, and many private merchants are collecting homespun cloth. The Yunmeng market trades 3,000 to 4,000 bolts of homespun cloth daily (December 1950). Due to the above reasons, the price of Chinese cotton is generally better, and in most areas it exceeds the price difference between Chinese cotton and American cotton stipulated in the original cotton grade price list announced by the Government Administration Council, and is equal to or exceeds the price of American cotton of the same grade. For example, in early December in Hebei Province, the price of Chinese cotton in Shenze and Wuji counties was equal to the price of 7/8 inch medium-grade American cotton. In October, the listed price of Zhejiang Yao flower by the flower, yarn, and cloth company was 725,000 yuan per dan, and the market price was sometimes higher than the listed price; if calculated according to the grade price difference list, it would only be 665,000 yuan. At the end of December, Hubei Yunmeng coarse lint was 200,000 yuan per dan higher than fine lint of the same grade. The reasons for this phenomenon: On the one hand, it is true that most of the American cotton is used as raw material for machine spinning, and it is purchased in large quantities by state-owned flower, yarn, and cloth companies and cooperatives. In some areas, the temporary shortage of funds and the failure to supply grain and coal in time have made the cotton-grain price ratio unreasonable. But the main reason is that the masses' demand for wadding and homespun cloth has increased (of course, yarn factories also have some raw materials), resulting in a situation where the supply of Chinese cotton cannot meet the demand.

    The above is the basic situation of Chinese cotton in 1950. In this year's Government Administration Council's decision on agricultural and forestry production in 1951, it is required that cotton production be increased by 36.9% compared with 1950, and it is decided that some closed areas with surplus grain can also develop cash crops such as cotton. This rapid increase in cotton fields, in addition to ensuring the cotton-grain price ratio, should take into account both Chinese and American cotton varieties, regardless of new or old cotton areas, as long as cotton planting is profitable, it can be developed as much as possible, so that this huge task can be completed smoothly; that is to say, not only American cotton should be developed in large quantities, but Chinese cotton can also be developed. Especially in areas where Chinese cotton accounts for a considerable proportion, it will be difficult to complete this year's cotton planting task if we do not pay attention to the expansion of Chinese cotton. In order to solve the cotton problem in the Southwest region, the Southwest Military and Political Committee issued instructions in mid-January to expand cotton fields, pointing out: "All areas suitable for cotton, regardless of Chinese or American cotton, should be greatly expanded. In areas where American cotton cultivation has been successful, American cotton should be expanded as much as possible. In areas where Chinese cotton is cultivated, Chinese cotton should be expanded as much as possible." The decision of this policy is very suitable for the current needs. However, in the current development of Chinese cotton, two different ideas should be overcome:

    The first idea is that the development of Chinese cotton is backward, and the development of Chinese cotton affects the promotion of American cotton. Therefore, let it be planted freely or especially lower the price of Chinese cotton. This idea mainly only sees the needs of machine spinning, and ignores the current national need for cotton as a whole, as well as the rapid increase in cotton fields, and that Chinese cotton has certain advantages and is suitable for cultivation in certain areas. It should be said that the development of Chinese cotton will not only not reduce American cotton, but also relatively make American cotton used in large quantities for machine spinning. Because the increase in Chinese cotton fields in 1951 is mainly in areas where Chinese cotton has a foundation; because these areas cannot completely change to American cotton this year due to insufficient American cotton seeds, or the masses have concerns about accepting American cotton, and American cotton varieties cannot replace the superiority of Chinese cotton (such as early maturity and strong resistance to diseases and insects). Therefore, the development of Chinese cotton does not affect the expansion of American cotton. In addition, due to the increase in Chinese cotton, the supply of hand spinning wadding will also increase substantially, so it can relatively increase the need for a large amount of American cotton to supply machine spinning. At the same time, this view of developing cotton production based on rapidly meeting the needs of the masses cannot be said to be backward.

    The second idea is: Should American cotton still be promoted if Chinese cotton is developed? It should be affirmed that "American cotton is the main variety to be developed in cotton production, and it should be promoted in large quantities." Experience has proven that as long as American cotton has a higher yield than Chinese cotton, it is easy to promote American cotton in Chinese cotton areas. For example, in the Yellow River cotton area, American cotton has accounted for the vast majority, and the main reason is that American cotton has a higher yield than Chinese cotton. These cotton areas should plan to promote American cotton and reduce Chinese cotton. As for the general American cotton areas, it is of course more important to continue to replace better cotton seeds and increase yield and quality.

    In order to complete the task of increasing cotton production in 1951, in addition to the policies and specific practices put forward in the Government Administration Council's decision on agricultural and forestry production, in terms of varieties, American cotton should be vigorously developed, and Chinese cotton should also be raised to a certain position and appropriately developed. The following two suggestions are now put forward:

    (1) The Central Finance and Economic Committee has announced a reasonable cotton-grain price ratio, with 7/8 inch medium-grade flower as the standard. Although the price of Chinese cotton is better this year, because it is coarse lint, the general lint length is about 3/4 inch. If we call on the masses to plant more, there may be some concerns. Therefore, in areas where Chinese cotton accounts for a considerable area, appropriate attention should be paid to the price of Chinese cotton to ensure that the masses have a market for planting Chinese cotton to dispel their concerns. In this way, the cotton planting task can be completed smoothly.

    (2) In areas where Chinese cotton accounts for a considerable area, those who cannot change to American cotton recently, the improvement of Chinese cotton varieties should also be paid attention to. For example, in the Northeast, Liaoyang No. 1 is promoted, and in eastern Sichuan, Songzi native cotton and Baiwan cotton are promoted. The 1951 cotton production plan decision in East China decides that the Chinese cotton cotton area adopts the method of selecting excellent cotton seeds to promote improved varieties (because Chinese cotton varieties are complex), so that the existing Chinese cotton can be improved a step further, which is very good. Experimental fields should also have the selection and breeding work of Chinese cotton, and at the same time, leadership should be strengthened in cultivation and planting this year to ensure that Chinese cotton also achieves high yields like American cotton.

　　为什么要适当地注意中国棉的增产工作
    臧成耀
    一九五○年全国棉花收获面积中，中国棉面积占百分之三○；主要产地为长江流域棉区，其次为黄河流域棉区及东北棉区北部的部分棉区。按省、区计算：皖北、苏南、四川的中国棉面积占全省棉田面积的百分之八十左右。苏北、湖南的中国棉占棉田总面积的百分之四十左右。湖北、浙江在百分之三十左右。群众种中国棉的原因有三：第一、成熟早，适合于两熟及无霜期较短的地区。第二、用做手纺，胎絮原料，弹花工作上较为便利。第三、种植省工和抗虫力较强。目前中国棉的用途有二：第一、是手纺和胎絮的需要。第二、是作为机纺十六枝纱以下的原料；前者占大部分，后者用量较少。全国大陆解放后，交通已经恢复，再加去年的丰收，群众购买力普遍提高，都在弥补日寇和国民党统治时期所造成的衣被不足的困难，因此胎絮需要量加大，棉布需用量增多，农村土布业也有恢复。如浙江的中国棉姚花在福建销路很好，湖北云梦土布过去畅销西北；抗日战争以来至一九四九年均很衰落，而今年又远销内蒙古、甘肃各地，私商坐收土布者极众。云梦市集每日（一九五○年十二月份）成交土布三千至四千匹。由于以上原因，中国棉价格普遍较好，大部地区均超过政务院公布的原棉等级差价表所规定中国棉、美国棉的差价，而与同等同级美国棉的价格相等或超过。如河北省十二月初，深泽、无极县中国棉价格竟和八分之七的中级美国棉价格相等。浙江姚花，十月份花纱布公司每担牌价为七二五、○○○元，而市价时有高过牌价者；如按等级差价表计算，则仅为六六五、○○○元。湖北云梦十二月底每担粗绒高过同等级细绒二○万元。造成这种现象的原因：一方面固然由于美国棉大部分作为机纺原料，由国营花纱布公司及合作社大量收购，在部分地区一时的资金不足，粮食、煤炭供应不上，使棉粮比价不合理。但更主要的是群众对胎絮、土布的需用量加大后（当然纱厂也有一部原料）中国棉供不应求而造成的形势。
    以上是一九五○年中国棉的基本情况，今年政务院发布的一九五一年农林生产决定中，要求棉花比一九五○年增产百分之三六点九，并决定某些粮食有剩余的闭塞区，也可发展棉花等经济作物。这种棉田的急速增加，除棉粮比价保证外，在棉花的品种上应该不论新老棉区，中国棉美国棉，只要种棉有利的地区，都可以尽量发展，这样才能使这一巨大任务顺利完成；这就是说，不仅美国棉要大量发展，而中国棉也可以发展。特别是中国棉占相当比重的地区，如不注意中国棉的扩展，要完成今年的植棉任务是有一定困难的。西南军政委员会为解决西南区的棉花问题，一月中旬发布了扩展棉田的指示，指出：“凡宜棉地区不论中国棉、美国棉均需大力扩充，在美国棉栽培有成效地区，尽力扩充美国棉，在中国棉栽培地区，尽量扩充中国棉。”这一方针的决定是很适合目前需要的。但在目前中国棉的发展上应该克服两种不同的思想：
    第一种思想认为发展中国棉是落后的，发展中国棉影响了美国棉的推广。因而让其自流地种植或特别压低中国棉的价格。这种思想，主要是仅看到了机纺的需要，而忽视了目前国家整个对棉花的需要，以及棉田的急速增加，和中国棉因有其一定的优点而适合于一定地区的栽培。应当说中国棉的发展，不仅不会使美国棉减少，而且相对的使美国棉大量用于机纺。因为一九五一年中国棉棉田的增加主要是在中国棉有基础的地区；因这些地区由于美国棉种子不足，今年不能全部换种美国棉，或者群众对接受美国棉有顾虑及美国棉品种尚不能代替中国棉优性者（如早熟及抗病虫力强等优点）。所以发展中国棉是不影响美国棉扩展的。另外由于中国棉的增加，供应手纺胎絮数量也将大量增加，因此即可相对的增加了大量美国棉供应机纺的需要，同时这种以急速满足群众需要为出发点的发展棉产的观点，当然不能说是落后的。
    第二种思想是：发展了中国棉是不是还要推广美国棉呢？应当肯定的说“美国棉是棉花生产中主要发展的品种，要大量的推广”。经验证明只要美国棉比中国棉产量高，在中国棉区推广美国棉是很容易的。如黄河流域棉区，美国棉已占绝大部分，其主要原因就是美国棉产量比中国棉高。这些棉区要有计划地推广美国棉减少中国棉。至于一般美国棉地区更换更优良的棉种，提高产量和质量当然更应该继续。
    为完成一九五一年棉花增产任务，除政务院农林生产决定中提出的政策及具体作法外，在品种上美国棉应大力发展而中国棉亦应该提到一定的地位而适当发展。今提出以下两点意见：
    （一）中央财政经济委员会已公布了棉粮合理比价，以纤维八分之七的中级花作标准，虽然今年中国棉价格较好，因系粗绒，一般绒长都在四分之三英寸左右，如再号召群众多种，可能有些顾虑。因此在中国棉占相当面积的地区，要适当的注意中国棉的价格，向群众保证种中国棉有销路以解除其顾虑。这样植棉任务才能顺利完成。
    （二）在中国棉占相当面积的地区，最近不能改种美国棉者，中国棉品种的改良工作亦应该提起注意。如东北推广辽阳一号，川东推广松滋土棉、百万棉，华东一九五一年棉产计划决定，中国棉棉区采用评选优良棉种的办法来推广良种（因中国棉品种复杂）使现有中国棉提高一步，都是很好的。试验场也应该有中国棉的选育工作，同时今年在耕作栽培上也要加强领导，以保证中国棉也和美国棉一样达到丰产。
