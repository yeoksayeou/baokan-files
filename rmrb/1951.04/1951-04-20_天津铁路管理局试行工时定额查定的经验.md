The question of "how to verify work hour quotas," already a proven advanced industrial management system in the Soviet Union, is new to us, a matter of "not knowing where to begin." To solve this problem, the Tianjin Railway Administration began trial implementation in the Nankou Machine Factory in February 1950, followed by the Fengtai Locomotive Depot in June of the same year, and the Tianjin Inspection Depot in November. At that time, one hundred and eight personnel were trained in work hour verification, forming working groups and heading to the three locations to carry out the work. Most administrative cadres and workers welcomed this work, but a few cadres feared the trouble. Some cadres felt that their work was already much better than in the Kuomintang era, and that the current work hours were tight enough, so further verification was unnecessary. Even some senior leaders did not fully recognize the importance of this work and transferred the work hour verification cadres midway through. Some leaders paid no attention to it and let it drift. After repeated education, especially through the practical education of work hour verification, the broad masses of cadres understood that this was a major link in managing the people's railways well, and as a result, created favorable conditions for promoting this work. The main experiences of these three units are described separately below.

	Investigation and Research on Working Day Hour Verification
	Liu Fenghan, a work hour verification staff member in the Nankou Machine Factory's forging shop, verified the working day hours of tongsman Zhang Zhenguo on January 31, 1950. Zhang Zhenguo used a one-ton steam hammer, a furnace, a set of molds, and six pairs of tongs to forge four locomotive cylinder crosshead pins, one footboard bracket, and one reversing gear valve cover in one day. Zhang started work at 5:00 PM and finished at 1:00 AM, for a total of 480 minutes. The breakdown of his time consumption was as follows:
	(1) Production time was divided into four categories: 1. Manual production time: 14 minutes; 2. Motorized production time: 3 minutes; 3. Machine-manual production time: 52.5 minutes; 4. Auxiliary production time (such as scribing, loading and unloading workpieces, measuring dimensions, etc.): 19 minutes. The total production time for the above four categories was 88.5 minutes, accounting for 18.44% of the total working day hours.
	(2) Wasted production time was divided into two types: one was wasted production time due to the worker's fault, such as rework and unnecessary redundant operations in production; the other was wasted production time due to the factory's responsibility, such as searching for tools and materials. Zhang Zhenguo was an advanced producer and had no wasted time in the former category. However, the latter category, wasted time due to the factory's organizational errors, amounted to 16 minutes, accounting for 3.33% of the total working day hours.
	(3) Interruption time was 302.5 minutes, accounting for 63.02% of the total working day hours. Among them, interruption time due to production process requirements, such as waiting for coal and iron, and waiting time for alternating between two types of work, took 171.5 minutes, accounting for 35.73%. Interruption time caused by organization and equipment, such as waiting for steam hammers, electricity, materials, work instructions, and occupying production time for meetings, took 123 minutes, accounting for 25.62%. Interruption time caused by the worker himself was divided into two types: one was necessary interruption time, i.e., legally mandated interruption time, such as going to the toilet, drinking water, smoking, and certain rest periods; the other was wasted interruption time by the worker, such as being late, leaving early, idle talk, loitering, and other matters that violate labor discipline. Because Zhang himself was an advanced producer, there was no wasted interruption time in the latter category. The former, necessary interruption time, was only 8 minutes, accounting for 1.67%.
	(4) Preparation and end time. The preparation and end time for the working day, such as changing work clothes, arranging the workplace, preparing tools, heating the furnace, changing out of work clothes, tidying up tools, and cleaning the workplace, took a total of 17 minutes, accounting for 3.54%. The preparation and end time for single-piece work, such as receiving work orders, materials, special tools, looking at drawings, measuring dimensions, etc., took a total of 56 minutes, accounting for 2.67%. The above totaled 73 minutes, accounting for 15.2%.
	Through the verification of individual working day hours, it can be seen which working day hours are necessary and should be extended as much as possible (such as production time); which working day hours are wasted and should be eliminated (such as wasted production time and wasted interruption time); which working day hours are necessary but should be reduced as much as possible (such as preparation and end time, interruption time caused by production procedures, and interruption time for personal needs); and which working day hours should be reduced or can be eliminated (such as interruption time caused by organization and equipment).
	(1) In the process of verifying Zhang Zhenguo's working day hours, it was found that the waste of production time was mainly caused by the factory's responsibility. There were two reasons for this: first, there were not enough tools, or the tools were arranged in a disorganized manner, or the tools were not repaired, resulting in more time spent searching for tools, or the tools found were not suitable, or time had to be spent repairing them. Second, the planning and preparation of materials were insufficient; they were neither classified nor arranged in a well-organized manner, and often had to be obtained when needed. The factory immediately took steps to improve the above shortcomings. First, a tool responsibility system was implemented, sufficient good tools were prepared, and they were classified, numbered, and arranged on tool racks. For example, only twelve molds were available in the past, but now one hundred and forty-one have been added. Second, a material responsibility system was implemented. Materials were received according to the production plan, classified, numbered, and arranged, and workers used a "small ticket system" to obtain materials.
	(2) In the process of verifying Zhang Zhenguo's working day hours, it was also found that interruption time caused by poor production operations and poor organization and equipment was a great waste. For example, there was no organization for using the furnace; using coal dust to prepare the furnace was both a waste of working day hours and prone to furnace collapse; there were not enough steam hammers, and there was no organization for their use. Small jobs used large steam hammers, and large jobs used small steam hammers. Steam hammers were not assigned to groups for use, resulting in a serious waste of time waiting for steam hammers. In order to correct this shortcoming, the following two methods were adopted: one was to use firebricks instead of coal dust to prepare the furnace and to implement a group-based furnace assignment system. This saved time preparing the furnace, and each group of workers could use two furnaces to heat iron at the same time, saving time waiting for heating. This time was reduced from 171.5 minutes to 131.5 minutes, a reduction of 40 minutes. The second was to add a steam hammer and implement a group-based hammer assignment system, stipulating that large jobs use large hammers and small jobs use small hammers. This reduced the time from 123 minutes to 9.5 minutes, a reduction of 113.5 minutes. The two items totaled a saving of 153.5 minutes.
	(3) The preparation and end time for one day of work was reduced from the previous 17 minutes to the current 10 minutes. The preparation and end time for single-piece work was reduced from the previous 56 minutes to the current 36 minutes, a total reduction of 27 minutes for both items.
	As a result of adopting the above improvement methods, production time increased from the previous 88.5 minutes to the current 293 minutes, an increase of 204.5 minutes, reaching 353.3% of the previous level.
	As the worker's production increased, the Tianjin Railway Administration implemented a bonus system for exceeding quotas, and the forging shop trialed a piece-rate wage system. As a result, the worker's wages increased. Zhang Zhenguo exceeded 97 wage points in January of this year, which shows that the piece-rate wage system not only increased the public's income but also improved the worker's life. In addition, improvements in safety and health work, such as opening skylights in the factory, adding chimneys, and improving the clinic, and the workers' increased awareness, technical progress, and improved operating methods, such as the cross-cutting flow operation method of one person using two furnaces, the continuous operation method of upper and lower shifts, i.e., the unfinished work of the upper shift is continued by the lower shift, and the cooperative operation method of steam hammer and hand hammer, have promoted the progress of work and improved efficiency.
	The Fengtai Locomotive Depot, through the verification of the working day hours of Zhang Weirong's group and twenty-one others by the work hour verification staff Tian Zijing and twenty-one others, also saw the following problems:
	(1) In verifying the working day hours of Zhang Weirong's group, it was found that one of the reasons for the waste of production time was caused by the worker's fault, including rework caused by some workers violating technical operating procedures, manual labor replacing machine labor, and time wasted by not being good at using special tools. In order to eliminate the waste caused by the worker's fault, it is necessary to improve the worker's technical level, eliminate rework, and educate workers to be good at using tools.
	(2) Poor organization and equipment caused a great waste of interruption time. For example, the shortage of tools caused interruption time waiting for tools; the untimely supply of materials caused interruption time waiting for materials; and meetings, oaths, reading covenants, roll calls, conveying instructions from superiors, and learning during production time caused a lot of interruption time. In particular, the lack of machines and the shortcomings in the production organization of the machine shop caused a serious waste of interruption time.
	In order to reduce or eliminate interruption time waiting for tools, it is necessary to add the necessary and sufficient tools. In order to eliminate interruption time waiting for materials, the foreman should cooperate with the inspection group leader and the driver leader to issue a list of materials required daily for each locomotive inspected, and hand it over to the material room to ensure timely supply of materials. In order to reduce or eliminate interruption time caused by occupying production time for meetings, oaths, reading covenants, roll calls, conveying instructions from superiors, and learning, it is stipulated that only half an hour per week is allowed to be used to convey important instructions from superiors, and the rest are conveyed through announcements and broadcasts to and from work. Learning should be conducted in spare time and should not occupy production time. Workers' meetings should not occupy production time. When necessary, the leaders of each group who are in charge of the work should not exceed two days per month, as stipulated by the Trade Union Law. The roll call system should be abolished and a sign-in system should be implemented. Oaths and reading covenants should be cancelled on weekdays and only conducted appropriately when necessary. In order to reduce or eliminate interruption time waiting for machine tools to turn workpieces, it is necessary to add the necessary machine tools, repair the old machine tools, and add workers. If necessary and possible, the machine bed turning should be changed to a three-shift rotating production system. The foreman is responsible for assigning large jobs to large machine tools and small jobs to small machine tools.
	(3) In verifying the working day hours of Zhang Weirong's inspection group, it was found that the worker's legally mandated interruption time was not much, but the interruption time wasted due to late starts, early finishes, idle wandering, idle talk, and other violations of labor discipline accounted for 3.82% of the total production time. In order to eliminate the interruption time wasted by workers, the administration should cooperate with the Party, the Trade Union, and the Communist Youth League to conduct education and take effective measures to strictly enforce labor discipline.
	(4) In verifying the working day hours of Zhang Weirong's inspection group, it was found that the preparation and end time was still too long. For example, the five people in the running gear department needed the following preparation and end time in the four-and-a-half-day production process: preparing tools, cleaning tools, preparing the workplace, exchanging tools, and repairing tools in small amounts were repeated one hundred and thirty-eight times, using 371 minutes. The reason for this was also the disorganized placement of tools and the poor quality of tools, which wasted working day hours. After the improvement, this time for the whole group has been greatly reduced. In order to reduce this time, it is also necessary to set up tool racks, add tool buckets, and add enough tools. After these improvements, it is estimated that 4,620 minutes of working day hours can be saved, accounting for a strong 10.39% of the total production hours. This number is very alarming.
	The purpose of working day hour verification is to reflect a picture of time consumption, identify the waste and loss of time, and, after analysis and research, propose methods to improve time consumption and eliminate time waste and loss. Time consumption is divided into the following items: First, production time, including basic production time and auxiliary production time. Basic production time is further divided into motorized, manual, and machine-manual. The more of this time, the better. Second, wasted production time, including waste caused by the factory and waste caused by the worker. After improvement, this time can be saved entirely, such as the time spent on rework, searching for tools, and searching for materials. Third, interruption time, including interruption time caused by the factory and interruption time caused by the worker. Interruption time caused by the factory is divided into two types: one is interruption time caused by production procedures, which is necessary. For example, the interruption time for forging shops to wait for the furnace to heat up is necessary if the organization is very good. The other is interruption time caused by the factory's organization and equipment, which includes both necessary and wasted interruption time. For example, although steam hammers, tools, and machine tools are sufficient and the organization is generally good, the degree of damage to various repairs in each section is different, so the amount of work varies, which will inevitably cause interruption time. This interruption time is unavoidable. For example, interruption time caused by poor organization even though steam hammers, tools, and machine tools are sufficient is a waste. Second, interruption time caused by workers includes both necessary and wasted time. For example, workers' going to the toilet, drinking water, and necessary rest time are necessary interruption time, or legally mandated interruption time. However, interruption time caused by being late, leaving early, idle wandering, idle talk, and other violations of labor discipline is wasted interruption time. Preparation and end time includes preparation and end time for both one day and single pieces. For example, preparing the workplace, tools, materials, and changing work clothes for one day of work, and tidying up the workplace, machine tools, tools, materials, and taking off work clothes after one day of work, is the preparation and end time for one day. The preparation and end time for performing the above items for one piece of work is the preparation and end time for a single piece.
	There are two methods for verifying working day hours: one is the time survey of individual work, which is to investigate the time consumption of one person's 480 minutes per day, such as the investigation of the working day hours of Zhang Zhenguo, an advanced worker in the forging shop of the Nankou Machine Factory. The other is the time survey of a production group, which is to investigate the time consumption of a production group's one day or more working day hours, such as the investigation of the working day hours of Zhang Weirong's locomotive inspection group in Fengtai. The time survey of individual work is more accurate than the time survey of production groups. When formulating standard working day hours, the time survey of individual work should be the basis, and the time survey of production groups should be the reference. In addition, various inspections and repairs of vehicles, as well as traffic and shunting operations, although the verification work is more difficult, must also be carried out in order to formulate accurate product working day hour quotas.
	When investigating working day hours, it is necessary to follow the mass line, inspire the worker's sense of ownership, and rely on the worker's conscious participation in the working day hour verification work, turning this work into a mass movement. If only the leaders verify the worker's working day hours without paying attention to mobilizing the masses, it will be difficult to find the correct standard. When verifying working day hours, a policy of balancing public and private interests should be adopted, fully combining the worker's personal interests with the state's interests. On the basis of developing production, care and improve the worker's labor conditions and life as much as possible, implement a production reward system, promote the eight-grade wage system, and then promote the piece-rate wage system in a planned and step-by-step manner. Insiders should verify for insiders. If the work hour verification staff is an outsider, they will not be able to see the problems. The person being verified should be an advanced producer in order to study and promote his experience. Of course, in order to compare with advanced producers, it is sometimes necessary to verify less advanced workers in order to improve their work. In addition, it is also necessary to verify the most widely representative types, such as when verifying Zhang Zhenguo and Zhang Weirong's group, the equipment conditions, production organization, material supply, labor organization, safety and health equipment, worker's production, and various problems in the production process of the entire factory are reflected.
	In the work hour verification, observation, calculation, analysis, research, summary, and improvement should be combined. Observe, calculate, analyze, research, and summarize at the same time, and propose improvement suggestions for relevant parties to implement. For the sake of caution, the improved time consumption quotas should be tested first, and a final decision should be made after they have proven effective.
	The verification of working day hours reveals that the main cause of wasted time is poor management. This verification of working day hours mainly exposes the shortcomings in this area, and the waste of time caused by these shortcomings is the greatest, which must be improved and is also possible to improve at present.
	In the process of verifying working day hours, not only are the shortcomings of each unit exposed, but also the shortcomings of other units associated with them are exposed. For example, when verifying the working day hours of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, the lack of a scheduling plan in the transportation department was exposed, which affected the production plan of the locomotive depot. The inability of the machine factory vehicles to leave the factory on time also affected the maintenance work of the locomotive depot. In order to overcome these shortcomings, it is necessary to improve the work of the overall situation. Only when all aspects cooperate well can the work of each unit be truly improved.

	Investigation and Research on Product Working Day Hour Verification
	On January 10, 1951, the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, led by the work hour verification group Tian Zijing and twenty-one others, verified the inspection of locomotive ㄇ丂１一九二七 by Chen Zhanmo's inspection group and twenty-one others.
	According to the scope of inspection work stipulated by the Ministry of Railways, this locomotive requires inspection and repair of ten parts including boiler, smoke chamber accessories, steam, frame, machinery, coal and water car, braking, lubricator, pressure gauge, motor, woodworking, etc. (woodworking was not checked because the work was fragmented, a total of 420 points of working day hours were reported). The verification result was a total of 34,415 minutes of production time, equivalent to 573.5 hours; 2,734 minutes of preparation and end time, equivalent to 45.6 hours; 3,144.5 minutes of legal interruption time, equivalent to 52.4 hours; totaling 40,293.5 minutes, equivalent to 671.5 hours. This is 548.5 hours less than the Ministry of Railways' stipulated inspection time of 1,220 hours.
	On March 20, 1951, the Tianjin Inspection Depot, led by the work hour verification staff Li Shijing and seven others, verified the X-type 53260 freight car inspected by Xing Shengrong's freight car inspection group and seven others.
	This freight car was inspected and repaired using a horizontal operation method. The so-called horizontal operation method is to divide a freight car undergoing inspection into four operating parts, which are operated simultaneously by four repair groups. This new horizontal operation method is a great improvement over the old operation method of five people in a group inspecting one car, or nine people in a group inspecting two cars, only collectively contracting the work, not dividing the repair work into groups, and not specializing in the work.
	This product working day hour verification was carried out after the working day hour verification. In other words, the product working day hour verification was carried out on the premise of the rational use of working day hours. Therefore, this product working day hour is the actual required time after eliminating wasted time.
	The method of verifying product working day hours is: according to the labor organization of the workers on site, the same number of work hour verification staff as the number of workers are equipped, and the direct and indirect working day hours of the entire production process are recorded from the time the workers start work.
	Direct inspection time is divided into four items according to the scope of work: braking department, connection department, body department, and bogie department, totaling 1,032.02 minutes, equivalent to 17.2 hours. In addition, each item has material collection time, totaling 7 minutes for the braking department, 7 minutes for the connection department, 36 minutes for the body department, and 40 minutes for the bogie department, totaling 90 minutes. This work should be done by the porter, but it is unreasonable for craftsmen to replace them, and it should be improved.
	The inspection group's accessory working day hours are divided into ten items according to the scope of work: woodworking, ironworking, forging work, painting, tinsmithing, lathe work, fitter work, welding, braking work, and wheel spring work. The above ten items total 771.84 minutes, equivalent to 12.86 hours.
	The total direct and indirect working day hours for inspection are 1,803.86 minutes, equivalent to 30.06 hours.
	The purpose of product working day hour verification is to further study the time consumption of all types of working day hours in the entire working day, identify the causes of time loss, and formulate reasonable new standards for all types of time consumption. The purpose of measuring product working day hours is to verify the time required for each scope of work according to all the operating ranges of the entire production process. Therefore, it is necessary to first have a working day hour verification to overcome wasted time, and then carry out a product working day hour verification. Only in this way can the product working day hours verified be reliable, and this verified working day hour can be used as a basis for formulating the standard working day hours required for production, which is the working day hour quota. Similarly, it can also be used as a basis for formulating a certain output within a certain period of time, which is the product quota.
	Before verifying the product working day hour quota, it is necessary to first understand the entire production process and scope of work, and verify the working day hours one by one according to each scope of work. It is necessary to fully utilize the experience and advanced operating methods of advanced workers and promote them universally.
	After the product working day hour quota has been verified, it can be used as a basis to formulate the standard product working day hour quota with reference to past statistics and the standard working day hour quota set by the Ministry of Railways. This standard working day hour quota is a standard that is between the new record achieved by advanced producers and the current naturally existing working day hour standard, and can be achieved by the general staff under normal, active working conditions. In other words, the standard working day hour formulated is a medium-high standard. About 80% of the workers should be able to reach this standard, and a part of the workers should exceed this standard. Only a few workers will lag behind this standard due to poor technology or lack of initiative. But as long as they can actively produce and improve their technology, they can strive to reach this standard. The standard working day hours formulated according to this principle will be supported by all workers, and advanced workers can also lead a small number of backward workers to catch up to this standard. About 80% of the workers in the forging shop of the Nankou Machine Factory can reach the working day hour quota standard, and this working day hour quota standard is correct. Only about 30% of the workers in the casting shop can reach the standard, this standard is wrong and should be corrected. After the correct standard working day hours have been formulated, they must be submitted to the relevant staff for deliberation and discussion, and then submitted to the factory management committee for approval and trial implementation, and formally implemented after they have proven effective. After the working day hour standard is determined, exceeding the quota is rewarded, stimulating the working day hour standard to reach a certain level. Combined with the implementation of the eight-grade wage system, the piece-rate wage system can be promoted in a step-by-step and planned manner.

	Two Sets of Working Day Hour Quota Management Systems Produce Two Results
	There are currently two sets of working day hour quota management systems: one is a working day hour standard formulated based on past experience and statistics. This working day hour quota standard is a working day hour quota management system that is satisfied with the status quo and does not seek progress, and is behind the actual production standards of workers. Before we touched the scientific working day hour quota verification management system, this quota once played a certain positive role, but it is wrong to absolutize its positive role. There are still many people who, on the pretext that workers are unwilling to accept the verified working day hour quota management system, are greedy for simplicity and stick to the working day hour quota management system formulated based on experience statistics, which is conservative and hinders the progress of work. The other is a working day hour quota management formulated by combining working day hour verification and product working day hour verification. This working day hour quota standard is to verify the current actual working day hours by observing, and expose the reasons for wasted time and point out the ways to correct them. The product working day hours verified on this basis are much more reliable. As long as the cadres and workers are told the benefits of this progressive working day hour quota management system, and the policy of benefiting both the public and private interests is adhered to, the workers will definitely welcome it. Therefore, we must distinguish between these two types of working day hour quota management systems and resolutely replace the empirical statistical working day hour quota management system with the verified working day hour quota management system.
	Let's first take the Tianjin Inspection Depot as an example to see the results of the two methods: One is the working day hour quota standard formulated based on past experience and statistics. For example, the Ministry of Railways stipulates that the working day hours for freight car inspection are 65 hours. From May to November 1950, the average actual working day hours required per car at the Tianjin Inspection Depot was 53.7 hours. From January 15, 1950 to January 15, 1951, a total of 27 inspected freight cars were verified, and the average actual working day hours required per freight car was 35.7 hours. Compared with the 65 hours set by the ministry, the verified 35.7 hours is 29.3 hours less, a reduction of 45%. Compared with the 53.7 hours of the empirical statistical working day hours of the depot, it is still 18 hours less, a reduction of 33.5%. Taking the entire depot's same production task as an example, the staffing according to the empirical statistical working day hour quota is 797. According to the staffing of the verified working day hour quota, it is 696, a difference of 101 people. If the production organization is improved, some people can still be drawn out. Taking 101 people as an example, the average wage expenditure per person per month is 413,881 yuan, then the total annual savings are nearly 500 million yuan.
	Let's take the Nankou Machine Factory as an example to see the two results: The average working day hours required for forging one ton of iron material accessories in the forging shop was 536 hours. After the verification in February 1950, the average actual working day hours required was 400 hours. The difference is 136 hours, a reduction of 25%. Taking the staffing of the forging shop as an example, if the production task remains unchanged, the staffing according to the empirical statistical working day hour quota is 68.8 people. Now, according to the staffing of the verified working day hour quota, it is 50 people, a reduction of 18.8 people, accounting for 27% of the original number of people. Taking the staffing of the entire machine factory's direct production technical workers as an example, the staffing according to the empirical statistical working day hour quota is 787 people. Now, according to the verified working day hour quota, it is 562 people, a difference of 225 people. The number of savings after the implementation of the new quota staffing is also amazing.
	It is very clear that the empirical statistical working day hour quota management system is a backward and old management system. The empirical statistical working day hours on which this quota is based are indeed the working day hours used in the past. However, in addition to the necessary working day hours, it also includes the wasted working day hours due to management and technical aspects that can be improved but have not yet been improved. Similarly, it can also be seen that the verified working day hour quota management system is a scientific and progressive management system. The working day hours on which this quota is based are specifically verified, and the shortcomings in management and technical aspects that can be improved are improved, and the waste of working day hours that can be eliminated and reduced are reduced and eliminated. Therefore, the working day hour quota formulated based on the verified working day hours is reliable. So our conclusion is: Now that we have touched the working day hour quota verification management system, we must replace the backward and old management system of empirical statistical working day hour quota with this scientific and progressive management system.

　　天津铁路管理局试行工时定额查定的经验
    中央人民政府铁道部天津铁路管理局局长  郭洪涛
    “如何查定工时定额”这一问题，在苏联已是行之有效的一种先进的工业管理制度，但对于我们却是一个新的问题，是一个“摸不着底”的问题。天津铁路局为了解决这个问题，于一九五○年二月，在南口机厂就开始试行，接着丰台机务段于同年六月、天津检车段于同年十一月，先后开始试行。当时训练出查定工时人员一百零八人，组成工作组，分赴三地进行工作。大部行政干部和工人，对这一工作抱欢迎的态度，但也有少数干部怕麻烦。有的干部觉得他们的工作已较国民党时代好得多了，现在的工时已经够紧了，再查定是多余的事。甚至某些高级领导干部，对于这个工作的重要性也认识不足，而在中途把查定工时的干部调走。有的领导干部对此不闻不问，任其自流。经过了反复地教育，特别是经过了查定工时的事实教育，使广大干部懂得了这是管好人民铁路的一个主要环节，结果创造了推广这一工作的有利条件。兹将这三个单位的主要经验分述如后。
  工作日工时查定的调查研究
    南口机厂锻工所查定工时人员刘凤翰，在一九五○年一月三十一日，查定掌钳工张振国一天的工作日工时。张振国用一吨汽锤，一盘烘炉，一套模型和六把钳子，一天内锻制了四个机车汽缸十字头销母，一个脚蹬板架和一个逆转机鞲鞴押盖。张从下午五时上工，夜一时下工，共用了四百八十分钟。其工时消费情况如次：
    （一）生产时间共分四项：一、手动生产时间一四分，二、机动生产时间三分，三、机手动生产时间五二点五分，四、辅助生产时间（如划线，上落活，量尺寸等）一九分。上述四项生产时间合计八八点五分，占生产时间的百分之一八点四四。
    （二）浪费的生产时间分两种：一是因工人的过失所浪费的生产时间，例如做返工活，及生产中不必要的多余操作所浪费的生产时间；二是因工厂责任所浪费的生产时间，例如找工具、材料等所浪费的时间。张振国是一个先进生产者，没有前一项的浪费时间。但因工厂组织过失造成的后一项浪费时间，计一六分，占生产时间的百分之三点三三。
    （三）中断时间三○二点五分，占一天工时的百分之六三点○二。其中因生产程序需要而中断的时间，例如等候煤铁、前后两种工作交替等待时间等，需时一七一点五分，占百分之三五点七三。因组织和设备造成的中断时间，例如等汽锤、等电、等料、等工作指示、占用生产时间开会等，需时一二三分，占百分之二五点六二。工人本人造成的中断时间分两种：一是必需的中断时间，也就是法定的中断时间，例如大小便、喝水、吸烟和一定的休息时间；二是工人浪费的中断时间，例如迟到、早退、闲谈、遛跶，及其他违反劳动纪律等事项所浪费的时间。因张本人系先进生产者，没有后一项浪费的中断时间。而前一项必需的中断时间，也仅有八分钟，占百分之一点六七。
    （四）准备与结束时间。工作日的准备与结束时间，如更换工作服、布置工作地点、准备机具、培烘炉、脱换工作服、收拾机具、清扫工作地点等，共需时一七分，占百分之三点五四。单件工作的准备与结束时间，如领活、领料、领专用工具、看图样、量尺寸等，共需时五六分，占百分之二点六七。以上共计七三分，占百分之一五点二。
    经过了个人工作日工时的查定，就可以看出那些工时是需要的，而且是应该尽可能延长的（如生产时间）；那些工时是浪费的，应该消灭的（如浪费的生产时间和浪费的中断时间）；那些工时是需要的，但是应该尽可能减少的（如准备与结束时间，因生产程序造成的中断时间和个人需要的中断时间等）；那些工时是应当减少或者可以消灭的（如因组织和设备造成的中断时间）。
    （一）在这次查定张振国的工作日工时过程中，看出生产时间的浪费，主要是由于工厂的责任所造成的。这方面的原因有两种：一是因工具不够用，或工具陈列混乱，或工具不修理，以致找工具多费了时间，或找来工具不合用，或要用时间去修理。二是材料的计划和准备不足，既不分类，陈列又很混乱，常须现用现领。厂方针对着上述缺点，当即予以改进。首先，实行工具负责制，准备了足够的良好的工具，并分类编号，陈列在工具架上。例如：仅模型一项，过去只有十二个，现在增置到一百四十一个。其次，实行了材料负责制，按生产计划领料，材料分类编号陈列，工人领料实行“小票制”。
    （二）在这次查定张振国的工作日工时过程中，也看出因生产操作不良，及因组织和设备不良造成的中断时间，是很大的浪费。例如，使用烘炉无组织；用煤末培炉，既浪费工时，又容易塌炉；汽锤数目既不够用，使用时又无组织，小活用大汽锤，大活用小汽锤，又未分组包用汽锤，造成等汽锤的严重浪费。为了改正这种缺点，采取了如下的两种办法：一是用耐火砖代替煤末培炉，并实行分组包炉制。这样，既节省了培炉的时间，每组工人又可同时用两盘炉烧铁，节省了等候烧铁的时间。此项时间，由过去的一七一点五分，减至现在的一三一点五分，减少了四十分钟。二是增设了一台汽锤，并实行分组包锤制，规定大活用大锤，小活用小锤，这样就由过去的一二三分减至现在的九点五分，减少了一一三点五分。两项共计节省工时一五三点五分。
    （三）一天工作的准备和结束时间，由以前的十七分减至现在的一○分。单件工作的准备和结束时间，由以前的五六分减少到现在的三六分，两项共计减少二七分。
    由于采取了上述改进的办法，生产时间由以前的八八点五分，增加到现在的二九三分，增加了二○四点五分，共计达到以前的百分之三五三点三。
    实行上述改进办法后，在今年三月二十日，仍由刘凤翰查定张振国一天的工作日工时。张用一吨汽锤，两盘烘炉（原来是一盘烘炉），一套模型和六把钳子，一天内却锻制了二十四个机车汽缸十字销母，为以前的六倍；三个脚蹬板架，为以前的三倍；七个逆转机鞲鞴押盖，为以前的七倍。在生产效能上（以工时计算）提高了百分之二九○点七。
    由于工人的生产增加了，天津铁路局实行了超额奖励制，锻工所试行了计件工资制，因此，工人的工资增加了。张振国在今年一月，就超过了九十七薪分，这说明计件工资不仅增加了公家收入，而且改善了工人生活。再加上安全卫生工作的改善：例如工厂开天窗、加烟筒、改善诊疗所等；再加上工人觉悟的提高，技术的进步，和作业方法的改进：例如一个人用两盘烘炉的穿插流水作业法；上下两班的接续作业法，即上班的未完活，下班的接着做；汽锤和手锤配合使用的配合作业法等。这样，就推进了工作的进步和效能的提高。
    丰台机务段由查定工时人员田紫荆等二十一人，查定甲检乙组张维荣等二十一人的工作日工时，也看出了以下几个问题：
    （一）在查定张维荣甲检组工作日工时中，看出浪费生产时间的原因之一，是由工人的过失所造成的，包括某些工人违反技术作业规程所造成的返工活，手工代替机器活及不善于使用专用工具造成的工时浪费。为了消灭因工人过失所造成的浪费，应当提高工人的技术水平，消灭返工活，并教育工人善于使用工具。
    （二）因组织和设备不良，造成很大的中断时间的浪费。例如：因工具不够用，造成等工具的中断时间；因材料供应不及时，造成等领材料的中断时间；因生产时间开会、宣誓、读公约、点名、传达上级指示和学习，造成许多中断时间；特别由于机器不够用和机器房生产组织上的缺点，造成严重地中断时间的浪费。
    为了减少或消灭等工具的中断时间，必须增添必要的足够的工具。为了消灭等材料的中断时间，应由工长协同甲检组长和司机长，在每甲检一台机车时，开具每日所需的用料单，交给材料室，保证及时供料。为了减少或消灭占用生产时间开会、宣誓、读公约、点名、传达上级指示和学习造成的中断时间，规定每周只准占用半小时传达上级的重要指示，其余均采取布告和上下班广播传达的方式；学习应在业余进行；不得占用生产时间；一般工人开会，一律不得占用生产时间；各团体担任工作的负责人有必要时，按工会法规定，每月不得超过两天；废止点名制，实行挂牌制；宣誓、读公约平日一律取消，只要有必要时适当进行。为了减少或消灭等机床旋活的中断时间，应增添必要的机床，修理老的机床，增添工人，旋床必要与可能时改为三班轮流生产制；由工长负责把大活交给大床旋，小活交给小床旋。
    （三）在查定张维荣甲检组工作日工时中，看出工人法定的中断时间是不多的，但因开工晚、收工早、闲遛、闲谈及其他违反劳动纪律等现象所浪费的中断时间，竟占全部生产时间的百分之三点八二。为了消灭此项工人浪费的中断时间，行政应协同党、工会、青年团进行教育，并采取有效的措施，严格地执行劳动纪律。
    （四）在查定张维荣甲检组工作日的工时中，看出准备与结束时间还太长。例如，走行部五个人，在四天半生产过程中，所需的准备与结束时间为：准备工具、清扫工具、准备工作地点、交换使用工具和零星修理工具等，竟重复一百三十八次，用了三七一分钟。其原因也是工具放置紊乱，工具质量不良，浪费了工时。经改进后，全组的这项时间已大为减少。为了缩减这个时间，就也需要设置工具架，增添工具桶，和增添足够的工具。经过这些改进后，估计可节省工时四千六百二十分，占全部生产工时的百分之十点三九强。这个数字，是很惊人的。
    工作日工时查定的目的，在于反映出一幅工时消费的图画，找出存在着的工时的浪费和损失，经过分析研究，提出改进工时消费，消灭工时浪费和损失的办法。工时的消费分为下列数项：一是生产时间，包括基本生产时间和辅助生产时间在内。基本生产时间，又分为机动的，手动的，和机手并动的三种，这种时间越多越好。二是浪费的生产时间，包括因工厂造成的和因工人造成的两种。经过改进以后，这种时间是可能全部节省下来的，如返工活、找工具、找材料等所用的时间。三是中断时间，包括因工厂造成的和因工人造成的两种中断时间。因工厂造成的中断时间又分为两种：一种是因生产程序造成的中断时间，这是必需的。如锻工所烘炉等候烧铁的中断时间，如果组织的很好，那就是必需的中断时间；另一种是因工厂的组织和设备造成的中断时间，其中又有必需的和浪费的两种中断时间。如汽锤、工具、机床虽然够用，组织的一般也很好，但因各段均为修配厂，各种修配品损坏的程度不同，因此，工作时多时少，必然会造成中断时间，这种中断时间是不可免的。如因汽锤、工具、机床虽然够用，但因组织不良所造成的中断时间，就是一种浪费。其次是工人造成的中断时间，其中又有必要的和浪费的两种，如工人大小便、喝水和必要的休息时间，就是必要的中断时间，或法定的中断时间；但如迟到、早退、闲遛、闲谈和其他违反劳动纪律造成的中断时间，就是浪费的中断时间。准备和结束时间，包括一天的和单件的两种准备和结束时间。如准备一天工作的地点、工具、材料和更换工作服等，及一天完工后收拾工作地点、机床工具、材料和脱工作服等，就是一天的准备和结束时间。为一件工作进行上述各项的准备和结束时间，就是单件的准备和结束时间。
    查定工作日工时的办法有两种：一种是个人工作的工时调查，这是调查一个人每天四百八十分钟的工时消费情况，例如对于南口机厂锻工所先进工作者张振国的工作日工时的调查。另一种是生产组的工时调查，这是调查一个生产组一天或一天以上工作日工时的消费情况，例如对于丰台张维荣机车甲检组工作日工时的调查。个人的工时调查比生产组工时的调查要准确些。制定标准工时时，应以个人工作日工时的调查为根据，以生产组工作日工时的调查为参考。此外，车辆的各种检修、以及行车调车作业等，虽然查定工作比较繁难，但也必须进行这种工作，才能制定准确的生产品工时定额。
    调查工作日工时时，必须走群众路线，要启发工人主人翁的感觉，依靠工人自觉地进行查定工时工作，把这种工作变成群众运动。如果只是领导者去查定工人的工时，而不注意发动群众，就很难查出正确的标准。查定工时时，应采取公私兼顾政策，把工人的个人利益和国家利益完全结合起来，在发展生产的基础上，尽可能地关怀与改善工人的劳动条件和生活，并实行生产奖励制，推行八级工资制，进而有计划有步骤地推行计件工资制。应该以内行查内行。查定工时人员如果是外行，一定看不出问题。被查的人应该是先进生产者，以便研究和推广他的经验，当然，为了和先进生产者比较，有时也需要查比较落后的工人，以便改进他们的工作。此外，还应查定代表性最广泛的典型，如查定张振国和张维荣组时，全厂的设备情况、生产组织、材料供应、劳动组织、安全卫生设备、工人生产情况以及生产过程中各方面的问题，都反映出来了。
    在查定工时中，应使观察、计算、分析、研究、总结、改进相结合，一面观察，一面计算、分析、研究、总结，提出改进意见，建议有关方面执行。为了慎重起见，应将改进后的工时消费定额，先行试验，行之有效后再作定案。
    工作日工时的查定，揭发了工时浪费主要原因，主要是管理不好造成的，此次查定工作日工时，主要地是暴露了这方面的缺点，这方面的缺点造成的工时浪费是最大的，在目前是必须改进，也有可能加以改进的。
    在查定工作日工时的过程中，不仅暴露各单位的缺点，而且也暴露了与之相联系的其他单位的缺点。例如，查定丰台机务段工作日工时时，就暴露了运输部门缺乏调度计划，影响到机务段生产计划的缺点。机厂车辆不能按时出厂，也影响到机务段的检修工作。为了克服这些缺点，必须改进全局的工作。也只有各方面都配合得好，才能真正提高每个单位的工作。
  生产品工时查定的调查研究
    丰台机务段于一九五一年一月十日，由查定工时组田紫荆等二十一人，查定甲检包修组陈占磨等二十一人甲检冖丂１一九二七号机车。
    根据铁道部定的甲检作业范围，这台机车要检修锅炉、烟室附属品、蒸汽、车架、机械、煤水车，制动、给油器、压力表、电机、木工等十一部（木工未查，因工作零碎，共报工时四二○分）。查定结果，总计生产时间三万四千四百十五分，折合五百七十三点五小时；准备与结束时间二千七百三十四分，折合四十五点六小时；法定中断时间三千一百四十四点五分，折合五十二点四小时；合计四万零二百九十三点五分，折合六百七十一点五小时。较铁道部定的甲检工时一千二百二十小时，少五百四十八点五小时。
    天津检车段于一九五一年三月二十日，由查定工时人员李士敬等七人，查定货车甲检组邢生荣等七人所甲检的Ｘ—型五三二六○号货车。
    这台货车是用横作业的方法来检修的。所谓横作业的方法，就是将一台甲检货车分作四个作业部分，由四个包修组同时进行作业。这种新的横作业法，比旧的五人一组甲检一台，或九人一组甲检两台，只集体包工，不分组包修，不专业化的作业方法，是一个极大的进步。
    这种生产品工时的查定，是在工作日工时查定以后进行的。换句话说，就是在合理使用工作日工时的前提下，进行生产品工时的查定。因此，这种生产品工时，就是消灭浪费工时以后的实际需要工时。
    查定生产品工时的办法是：按现场工人的劳动组织，配备与工作者数目相同的查定工时人员，从工人开始作业起，纪录全部生产过程的直接工时和间接工时。
    甲检直接工时按作业范围分为制动部、连结部、车体部、台车部四项，合计一千零三十二点零二分，折合十七点二小时。此外每项都有领料时间，计制动部七分，连结部七分，车体部三十六分，台车部四十分，计九十分。此项工作应由运搬工去做，由工匠代替，是不合理的，应当改进。
    甲检组配件工时，按作业范围分为木工、铁工、?工、油漆工、白铁工、旋床工、钳工、熔接工、制动工、轮弹簧工。以上十项合计七百七十一点八四分，折合十二点八六小时。
    甲检直接、间接全部工时，共一千八百零三点八六分，折合三十点零六小时。
    生产品工时查定的目的，是进一步研究全部工作日各类工时消费的情形，找出工时损失的原因，并制定合理的新的各类工时消费标准。至于测定生产品工时的目的，就在于按照全部生产过程的各个作业范围，查定其所需要的时间。所以必须先有工作日工时的查定，克服了浪费的工时，然后再进行生产品工时的查定，这样查出的生产品工时，才是可靠的，才可拿这种查定的工时为根据，制定生产品所需的标准工时，这就是工时定额。同样地，也可依此为根据，制定一定时间内的一定产量，这就是产品定额。
    查定生产品工时之前，必须先了解全部生产过程和作业范围，根据每一个作业范围逐一查定工时。必须充分地利用先进工作者的经验和先进的作业方法，普遍地推广起来。
    在查定了生产品工时定额之后，就可依此为根据，参照以往的统计和铁道部定的工时定额标准，制定标准的生产品工时定额。这种标准工时定额，是介乎先进生产者所达到的新纪录与目前自然存在的工时标准之间，而为一般职工在正常的积极工作条件下，都能达到的标准。换句话说：制定的标准工时，就是中等偏高的标准。应当有百分之八十左右的工人能够达到这个标准，其中有一部分工人应当超过这个标准，只有少数工人或因技术较差，或因积极性不够，才落后于这个标准。但只要他们能够积极生产，提高技术，都可争取达到这个标准。根据这个原则制定的标准工时，就能够得到全体工人的拥护，而且先进的工人也可带动少数落后工人赶上这个标准。南口机厂锻工所的工时定额标准，百分之八十左右的工人都能达到，这个工时定额标准是正确的。铸工所只有百分之三十左右的工人才能达到，这个标准便是错误的，应当加以改正。制定了正确的标准工时之后，必须要交给有关的职工酝酿讨论，并由工厂管理委员会通过后，呈报上级批准试行，行之有效再正式实行。工时标准确定之后，经过超额奖励，刺激工时标准达到一定水平，再结合实行八级工资制，即可有步骤地、有计划地推行计件工资制。
  两套工时定额管理制度，产生两种结果
    现行的工时定额管理制度有两套：一套是凭过去经验，凭以往统计制定的工时标准。这种工时定额标准，是安于现状，不求进步的工时定额管理制度，是落后于工人实际的生产标准的。在我们没有摸到科学的查定工时定额管理制度之前，这种定额曾经起过一定的积极作用，但把它的积极作用绝对化就错了。现在仍有不少的人，借口工人不愿接受查定的工时定额管理制度，贪图省事，墨守那种靠经验统计制定的工时定额管理制度，则是保守的，阻碍工作前进的。另一套则是以工作日工时查定和生产品工时查定相结合来制定的工时定额管理，这种工时定额标准，是用观察的方法，把现在实际的工作工时查定出来，并揭发工时浪费的原因，指出改正的办法。在这样的基础上查定出来的生产品工时，就比较可靠得多了。只要向干部和工人讲清楚这种进步的工时定额管理制度的好处，坚持走群众路线，坚持公私两利政策，工人一定是欢迎的。因此，我们必须把这两种工时定额管理制度加以区别，坚决地以查定的工时定额管理制度代替经验统计工时定额管理制度。
    先以天津检车段为例来看两种方法的结果：一种是根据以往经验统计所制定的工时定额标准。如货车甲检工时，铁道部规定为六十五小时，从一九五○年五月至十一月，天津检车段平均每辆实际需要工时五十三点七小时。从一九五○年一月十五日起至一九五一年一月十五日止，共查定甲检货车二十七辆，平均实际每辆货车需要工时三十五点七小时。拿查定的三十五点七小时来比部定的六十五小时则少二十九点三小时，减少了百分之四十五。如果和该段经验统计工时五十三点七小时比较，还少十八小时，减少百分之三十三点五。以全段同一生产任务为例，按照经验统计工时定额的定员，共七百九十七名。按照查定的工时定额定员，则为六百九十六名，两者相差一百零一名。如果生产组织改善了，还可抽出一部分人来。就以一零一人，每人每月以平均工资支出为四十一万三千八百八十一元计算，那么，全年节省支出合计近五亿元。
    再以南口机厂为例，来看两种结果：锻工所锻制每吨铁料配件，平均所需工时为五百三十六小时，经过一九五○年二月查定以后，实际平均所需工时为四百小时。两者相差一百三十六小时，减少了百分之二十五。以锻工所的定员来说，如生产任务不变，按照经验统计工时定额的定员为六十八点八人，现在按照查定的工时定额定员，则为五十人，减少了十八点八人，占原有人数的百分之二十七。以全机厂直接生产的技术工人定员来说，按照经验统计工时定额的定员为七百八十七人，现在按照查定工时的定额来定员，则为五百六十二人，两者相差二百二十五人。实行新的定额定员后，节约数目也很惊人。
    这样，很显然地看出：经验统计工时定额管理制度是一种落后的陈旧的管理制度，这种定额所根据的那些经验统计工时，确实也是过去所用的劳动工时。但是，其中除了必须的劳动工时外，还包括着在管理和技术方面可能改进但尚未改进所浪费了的工时。同样地也可看出查定工时定额管理制度，是一种科学的进步的管理制度，这种定额所根据的工时，是经过具体查定，把那些在管理和技术方面可能改进的缺点，加以改进；把可能消灭和减少工时的浪费，加以减少和消灭。因此，根据查定的工时所制定的工时定额是可靠的。所以我们的结论是：现在已经摸到了工时定额查定的管理制度，就必须以这种科学的进步的管理制度，代替经验统计工时定额的那种落后的陈旧的管理制度。
