I Cannot Forget the Persecution by Secret Agents
Reader Fu Zongshun Supports the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries

To the Editor:
    I resolutely support the government's vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Because I have suffered persecution by secret agents, I personally experienced the cruelty and viciousness of counter-revolutionary elements towards the people.

    On the evening of April 17, 1948, Hebei High School held a teacher-student get-together. While the meeting was in progress, secret agents rushed in with pistols, wooden clubs, and sabers, and smashed the venue. Many students were beaten until their heads were bleeding. I was not in the meeting at the time, but when I heard the shouts and gunshots, I came out of the dormitory and was surrounded by secret agents, who knocked me unconscious with wooden clubs. When I woke up, my legs were unable to move, and my face, nose, and eyes were swollen beyond recognition. That night, as many as sixty or seventy students were injured by the secret agents.

    After we dozens of students were injured, we were confined in the principal's office. The secret agents dragged out the lightly injured students and beat them again; and robbed all the belongings of us dozens of people.

    Later, the secret agents put me in a car, blindfolded me, and drove to three or four different places. Every time I arrived, I saw many kind people who had been arrested by secret agents and subjected to torture: some had their bodies burned into a mass of sores, some were beaten until they vomited blood, some had their legs broken, some...; they could not lie down, they could not sit down, the pain they were in was indescribable. That's how cruel and inhuman the secret agents were to the people!

    I was interrogated at No. 2 Fenzi Hutong. At first, they made me stand on three bricks with my hands raised; then they beat me with boards. Later, they tied me up and put me on the tiger bench. Finally, they whipped me. They didn't let me close my eyes for seventy-two hours, using fatigue and beatings to torture me. They said, "Burying dozens of you is easier than burying a few dogs! Burying a dog still makes a 'woof woof' sound, but burying you, no one will hear anything." The secret agents regarded the lives of the people as less valuable than a dog. I will never forget this hatred until I die!

    After the Chinese people achieved victory, the secret agents still want to sabotage our construction, kill our people, and attempt to make us return to the days when we were worse off than dogs. I resolutely support the government's suppression of counter-revolutionaries, to avenge the people who have been harmed by them, and to protect our beautiful life!

　  我不能忘记特务对我的迫害
  　读者傅宗舜拥护镇压反革命编辑同志：
    我坚决拥护政府大张旗鼓镇压反革命。因为我曾受过特务的迫害，亲身体验到反革命分子对人民的残酷和毒辣。
    一九四八年四月十七日晚，河北高中举行师生联欢会。会议正进行时，特务们拿着手枪、木棒、战刀冲了进来，把会场捣毁。很多同学被打得头破血流。我当时没在会场，听到叫打声和枪声，就从宿舍里出来，被特务们围住，用木棒把我打昏过去了。当我醒过来时，两腿已经不能动弹，脸上、鼻子、眼睛都肿得不像样子。这天晚上，被特务打伤的同学共六七十人之多。
    我们几十个同学被打伤后，又被禁闭在校长室里。特务们把伤得较轻的同学拖出去再打；并把我们几十个人的东西都抢光。
    后来，特务们把我架上小汽车，蒙紧了眼睛，走了三四个地方。每到一个地方，都看见有很多被特务逮捕而遭受酷刑的善良的人们：他们有的身上被火烫得烂成一片，有的被打的吐血，有的腿被打断，有的……；他们躺不能躺，坐不能坐，那种惨痛的情况我实在无法形容。特务们对待人民就是这样惨酷，这样没有人性！
    我在粉子胡同二号被审问了。起初他们叫我站在三块砖上，双手举起；然后用板子向我身上乱打。后来把我捆起来上老虎凳。最后用鞭子抽打我。他们七十二小时不让我闭眼，用疲劳和毒打来折磨我。他们说：“埋你们几十个人比埋几条狗还省事！埋狗还要‘汪汪’叫几声，埋你们谁也听不见。”特务们把人民的生命看得连条狗都不如。这仇恨，我到死也不能忘记！
    在中国人民得到胜利以后，特务们还要来破坏我们的建设，杀害我们人民，妄想再让我们回到过去狗都不如的日子去。我坚决拥护政府镇压反革命，为曾经受过他们残害的人民报仇，并且保障我们美好的生活！
