　　US-UK Trade Conflicts Deepen
    US Attempts to Force Open the Entire British Empire Market
    "International Tariff and Trade Conference" Aborted
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 11th] The so-called "International Tariff and Trade Conference," an instrument used by the United States to economically attack other capitalist countries, has been declared a failure on March 31st of this year, after more than six months of secret negotiations since its opening in Torquay, England, on September 28th of last year. The conference's progress and outcome have once again demonstrated that, amid the deepening crisis in the capitalist world, the contradictions between US and British imperialism have become increasingly acute. At this conference, attended by thirty-nine countries, the main objective of the United States was to completely destroy the British Imperial Preference system (i.e., the preferential tariff system adopted in mutual trade between members of the British Empire), thereby opening the entire British Empire market completely to US monopoly capitalists. According to the Associated Press, "Throughout the negotiations, the powerful American group consistently demanded a reduction in the Imperial Preference rates of the British Commonwealth countries." However, the result was that "Britain resolutely refused to concede, insisting on discussing the issue of their trade guarantees with all Commonwealth countries." Thus, the conference ultimately ended with "a conflict between the US and Britain," which even "threatened to break the long-term negotiations." Even the British Financial Times despairingly acknowledged that the Torquay negotiations proved the existence of deepening contradictions between the US and Britain on trade policy issues.
    Soviet Pravda commentator Marinin, in a recent international review commenting on the failure of the Torquay Conference, pointed out: This conference once again revealed the sharp struggles developing behind the scenes of the North Atlantic Alliance. The American offensive against Britain is a fierce one. Under the current circumstances of a significantly deteriorated British economy, abolishing the Imperial Preference system would severely hit Britain's entire foreign trade, rapidly deplete its foreign exchange reserves, and cause national disaster. This prospect forced the British ruling group to reject American demands. Marinin pointed out: Of course, the failure of the Torquay Conference does not mean that the United States will cease its continued attacks on its "partners." On the contrary, even fiercer blows are yet to come. The contradictions between the US and Britain are deepening and entering a new and more acute stage.

　　美英贸易上矛盾日深
    美企图迫使整个英帝国市场开放
    “国际关税及贸易会议”流产
    【新华社十一日讯】作为美国在经济上进攻其他资本主义国家的一个工具的所谓《国际关税及贸易会议》，自去年九月二十八日在英国托奎开幕以来，经过六个多月的秘密谈判，已于今年三月三十一日宣告流产。会议的进程和结果又一次证明了在资本主义世界危机日趋深重的情况下，美英帝国主义间的矛盾已愈来愈尖锐。在这个有三十九个国家参加的会议上，美国的主要目的是要完全摧毁英帝国优先权制度（即英帝国各成员国间相互贸易中所采取的特惠税率制度），使整个英帝国市场完全向美国垄断资本家开放。据合众社透露：“在整个谈判期间，强大的美国集团始终要求减低英联邦国家的帝国特惠税率”，然而结果是：“英国坚决不肯退让，它坚持要与英联邦所有国家商讨有关它们的贸易保证的问题。”这样，会议最后竟不能不以“美英之间的冲突而告结束”，而这个冲突甚至“使长期谈判有决裂之势”。连英国金融时报也绝望地承认，托奎谈判的过程证明美英两国在贸易政策问题上存在着日益加深的矛盾。
    苏联真理报评论家马里宁最近在国际述评中评论托奎会议的失败时指出：这次会议再度显露了在北大西洋联盟幕后发展着的尖锐斗争。美国对英国的进攻是一种凶狠的进攻，在目前英国经济情况已经相当恶化下，废止帝国优先权制度将使英国整个对外贸易遭到沉重的打击，使它的外汇储备迅速耗尽，而引起全国的灾难。这种前景迫使英国统治集团拒绝了美国的要求。马里宁指出：当然，托奎会议的失败并不意味着美国会终止对它的“伙伴”继续进攻。相反地，更凶狠的打击还在后面。美英间的矛盾正在日益加深，正在进入新的更加尖锐的阶段。
