　　How the Shanghai State-Owned No. 9 Cotton Mill Selects Propagandists
　　Wang Rushan
The Communist Party of the Shanghai State-Owned No. 9 Cotton Mill has concluded its selection of propagandists. With the approval of the Yangshupu District Committee of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, sixty-five people were selected (out of a total of more than 3,200 employees in the factory), including thirty-eight Party members, fourteen Communist Youth League members, and thirteen non-Party activists. Among them were forty-four cadres including Party branch committee members, administrative section chiefs, trade union executive committee members, and Communist Youth League branch secretaries. There were twelve technical workers, four model workers, and nineteen elderly workers. The educational level of the propagandists: two illiterate, thirty-eight with primary school education, fifteen with junior high school education, six with senior high school education, and four with university education.
When selecting propagandists, the State-Owned No. 9 Cotton Mill first conducted more than ten days of top-down discussions and deliberations, so that most Party members and League members recognized the benefits of establishing a propaganda network, and measured themselves against the four conditions for propagandists stipulated by the Party Central Committee, proposing to strive to become propagandists through practical actions. Therefore, they took the opportunity of the factory's convening of a workers' representative assembly to widely publicize among the workers how to truly become masters of their own affairs, how masters should care for their own factory, and love their own country, etc., to inspire and guide the masses to jointly submit more than 4,000 suggestions related to factory improvement to the assembly; and to deliberate and formally establish patriotic covenants to welcome the representatives back to the workshops. The branch then carried out the work of selecting propagandists on such a basis.
The method of selecting propagandists: targeting activists in past and present movements, Party members and trade union cadres were nominated by branch committee members; League members were nominated by the general branch committee members of the League and made a preliminary review; activists among the masses were nominated by Party group leaders and Party cadres distributed in the workshops, submitted to the branch committee for discussion and approval, and then branch committee members went to talk to them individually, solicit opinions, and help fill out application forms. During the individual talks, Party members and League members were informed that although they had been approved by the branch committee, it was still an application, and they could only be determined as formal propagandists after approval by the district committee. And point out his still existing shortcomings, in order to correct them in the work. For the masses, first start with their understanding of the propaganda network, inspire them to voluntarily serve as propagandists, and then point out the direction of their efforts. After individual talks and filling out application forms, the process of filling out the forms is an educational process for the applicant. When he fills in "Why do you want to be a propagandist," he must consider the benefits of establishing a propaganda network and his own attitude. At the same time, due to the strict procedures, he strengthened his concept of serving the people as a propagandist, so many comrades said that they were not qualified as propagandists and wanted to overcome their shortcomings and better serve the people. And asked the branch to help and educate him more in the future, so that the work can be done better.
According to the spirit of the instructions from the higher authorities and combined with the specific conditions of the factory, the following points were determined to be paid attention to when selecting propagandists, as a basis for the branch committee to approve the list: A. Whether they meet the conditions. For Party members, the main thing is to see if they have a certain propaganda ability. That is to say, as a Party member, the first three of the conditions for propagandists have been basically resolved at the time of joining the Party, as long as he can explain the Party's policies and propositions to at least a few people, and can make others understand, he can be approved as a propagandist (Editor's note: The three conditions of political consciousness, setting an example in work, and contacting the masses should still be examined.) For the masses, the main thing is to see whether they are politically pure, whether they can set an example and contact the masses, and then consider other conditions. B. According to work needs: (1) Try to take care of all departments have propagandists. In this way, the opinions of the masses in various departments can be understood and reflected in a timely manner, and the Party's policies can be implemented to the masses in various departments. For propagandists with weaker propaganda ability, the branch committee should promptly and actively help them solve difficulties so that they can well assume the tasks assigned to them by the Party. (2) As far as possible, distribute propagandists to mass propaganda organizations and master propaganda tools (blackboard newspapers, comics, etc.) to make them more effective in propaganda. (3) Pay attention to absorbing cadres from various systems as propagandists. In this way, the Party's policies and propositions can be implemented to the masses through various systems and become the conscious actions of the masses (Editor's note: According to work needs, it is right to appropriately pay attention to the distribution of propagandists, but we should prevent this from lowering the conditions for propagandists.) C. Take care of leadership ability. Establishing a propaganda network is a new job, and the leadership lacks experience and methods. In the initial establishment of the propaganda network, if too many propagandists are selected, it is easy to become a formality, so it is determined to develop and expand from consolidation.
Because attention has been paid to the above three points, the selected propagandists are generally the cadres, Party members, League members, and activists who unite around the Party, who are closest to the masses, familiar with the lives and thoughts of the masses, and supported by the masses. Therefore, when the list of propagandists was announced at the workers' representative assembly, the masses said: "With propagandists, we can understand more principles!" An elderly female worker held the propagandist's hand and said: "If you become a propagandist, we can ask you about anything."
The State-Owned No. 9 Cotton Mill has made great achievements in the work of selecting propagandists, but there are also some shortcomings. One of the most important shortcomings is that the conditions for propagandists were set too high at the beginning of the selection. For example, it is required that Party members who are propagandists must not have any shortcomings in their ideology and work style. This is impossible.

　　上海国营棉纺九厂怎样选拔宣传员
　　王如山
    上海国营棉纺第九厂共产党的宣传员选拔工作已告结束。经中共上海市杨树浦区区委批准六十五名（全厂职工共三千二百余名），内有党员三十八名，团员十四名，非党积极分子十三名。其中包括党的支部委员、行政科长、工会执委、青年团分支部书记等干部共四十四名。技术工人十二名，劳动模范四名，老年工人十九名。宣传员的文化程度：文盲二名，小学三十八名，初中十五名，高中六名，大学四名。
    国营棉纺九厂在选拔宣传员时，首先经过十余天自上而下的讨论酝酿，使大部党、团员，都认识到建立宣传网的好处，并以党中央所规定的宣传员四个条件衡量了自己，提出在实际行动中争取作宣传员。因此他们乘全厂召开职工代表大会时机，在工人群众中，广泛地宣传怎样才是真正翻身作主人，主人应如何关心自己的工厂，爱护自己的国家等，以启发、引导和群众一起向大会提出了四千多条有关工厂改进的意见；并且酝酿与正式订立爱国公约来迎接代表回车间。支部即在这样一个基础上进行了选拔宣传员的工作。
    宣传员选拔方式：以过去与现在运动中的积极分子为对象，党员与工会干部由支部委员提名；团员由团总支部委员提名，并作初步审查；群众当中的积极分子由党的小组长及分布在车间的党员干部提名，汇交支部委员会讨论通过后，支部委员再分头找他们进行个别谈话，征求意见，帮助填写申请书。在个别谈话时，对党、团员说明虽是经过支部委员会通过，仍属申请性质，待区委批准后才能确定为正式宣传员。并指出他尚存在的缺点，以求在工作中改正。对群众则先从他对宣传网的认识谈起，启发他自愿担任宣传员，再指明他的努力方向。经过个别谈话与填写申请书，对填表人就是个教育过程。他在填写“为什么要当宣传员”时，就要考虑到建立宣传网的好处与自己所抱的态度。同时因手续的严格，而加强了他对宣传员的为人民服务观念，所以许多同志表示自己还不够宣传员条件，要克服缺点，更好为人民服务。并要求支部今后要多帮助与教育他，把工作作得更好。
    又根据上级指示的精神结合本厂的具体条件，确定了选拔宣传员的应注意的几点，以作支部委员会通过名单时的依据：甲、是否符合条件。对党员主要是看他是否有一定的宣传能力。即是说，作为一个党员对宣传员条件中的头三条，在入党时基本上已经解决，只要他至少能在几个人面前讲解党的政策主张，又能使人家明白，就可通过他当宣传员，（编者按：对于政治觉悟，工作中以身作则，联系群众等三条件仍应考查。）对群众则主要是看他是否政治纯洁，能否以身作则联系群众，再考虑其他条件。乙、根据工作需要：（一）尽量照顾到各部门都有宣传员。这样可以及时了解与反映各部门的群众意见，又能使党的政策贯彻到各部门的群众中去。对于宣传能力较弱的宣传员，支部委员会及时主动帮助他解决困难，使其很好担任起党所交给他的任务。（二）尽可能使宣传员分布到群众宣传组织中，掌握宣传工具（黑板报、漫画等），使其更能发挥宣传效能。（三）注意吸收各系统的干部作宣传员。这样可以使党的政策主张通过各系统贯彻到群众中去，而变为群众的自觉行动（编者按：根据工作需要，而适当地注意宣传员的分布是对的，但应防止因此而降低宣传员的条件。）丙、照顾领导能力。建立宣传网是件新工作，领导上缺乏经验与办法，在初步建立宣传网时，如选拔宣传员过多，容易流于形式，故确定从巩固中再发展壮大。
    由于注意了以上三点，选拔出来的宣传员一般都是最接近群众，熟识群众的生活和思想情况，且为群众所拥护的干部、党、团员和团结在党周围的积极分子。所以当宣传员名单在职工代表大会上宣布后，群众说：“有了宣传员我们可以多懂得一些道理啦！”一个年老女工友拉着宣传员的手说：“你当了宣传员，我们有啥事体可以问你了。”
    国营棉纺九厂在选拔宣传员工作上，是有很大成绩的，但是，也还有若干缺点。其中最重要的一个缺点是在开始选拔时，把宣传员的条件规定太高。例如，要求作宣传员的党员，必须是思想意识与工作作风都没有一点缺点的。这是不可能的。
