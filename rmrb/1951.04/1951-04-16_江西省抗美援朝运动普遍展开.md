　　Jiangxi Province Launches Universal Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Movement
    Propaganda Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Starting from November last year, the entire province of Jiangxi, based on the peace signature campaign, launched a movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country. This movement has gradually expanded from urban areas to the vast countryside, and from the beginning of February to the present, it has been universally launched in every corner of the province.

  Assessment of the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Movement
    After several months of carrying out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the thinking of the masses, especially the urban masses, has been significantly improved.

    Through repeated exposure of the enemy's crimes and propaganda about the strength of the peace camp, the general public's worship, affinity, and fear of America have been greatly reduced. Ideas of hating, despising, and scorning U.S. imperialism have begun to take root, and there has been further understanding of the Soviet Union. The past blind hatred and anti-Soviet sentiments of some people have changed, and pro-Soviet sentiments have begun to develop. There is further understanding of the strength of world peace forces and the Chinese people's strength, as well as the essential fragility of imperialism, enhancing national self-esteem, self-confidence, and confidence in victory. The masses are beginning to realize that they have become citizens of a powerful nation. Through patriotic ideological education in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the sense of responsibility of the masses, especially workers, youth, and students, towards the country and nation has been strengthened. Many factories and enterprises in cities have launched patriotic production emulation campaigns, and many heroic deeds have emerged. For example, railway workers in Zhangshu increased daily production of rail spikes from sixty to one hundred and ten; Jiujiang Futai Factory increased monthly production of large tractors from three to six, saving several tens of millions of yuan per month; Jiujiang Porcelain Factory doubled its output and reduced waste products by five percent. Young students are enthusiastically participating in military cadre schools, and some mothers are rushing to treat their sons' trachoma. The vast majority of parents believe that it is most glorious for their children to participate in military cadre schools in the new China. Through the election of labor models in various counties and districts, patriotic production emulations have also been widely launched in rural areas.

    In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, as of March 15, according to incomplete statistics, the entire province has written 29,243 letters of condolence, donated 46,082 items of condolence (including 8,085 condolence bags), solicited 260,000 sets of winter clothing, and contributed 1,627,090,808 yuan in comfort funds. 977 people have signed up to join the Korean volunteer army, 9,660 people have signed up to join military cadre schools, 4,498 Christians have signed in favor of reform (accounting for half of the province), and 8,610 Catholics (accounting for one-tenth of the province). These figures also illustrate the upsurge of patriotic thought among the broad masses.

    The main shortcomings in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea are: (1) The development of the movement is uneven: it is more widespread and in-depth in cities, but poorer in rural areas; generally, work is best among students in cities, followed by workers (this is a major defect), and even worse among other classes; there is more exposure of U.S. imperialism, and less propaganda about the Soviet Union and the motherland. (2) After exposing and denouncing U.S. imperialism, there is insufficient connection to personal ideological criticism, and insufficient conscious emphasis on turning enthusiasm into strength in combination with actual work. There is insufficient systematic education from a theoretical and practical point of view. The general public has little essential understanding, so their thinking is not yet consolidated.

  Some Experiences
    (1) Experience over the past few months has proven that whether or not the leading organs attach importance to it, and whether or not they have ideologically recognized the importance of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, is the key to the success of the movement. In some places, the past work foundation was not good, but because the leading cadres attached importance to it, the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea was successful, and various tasks also improved accordingly. The most important thing is that the leadership must combine the central work with the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, pay close attention to the development of current events and the ideological dynamics of the masses, and make timely arrangements and guidance. All erroneous ideas and practices that advocate patriotism and believe that the masses will naturally support it without the need for vigorous promotion, and that allow the movement to drift along, will lead to the failure of the movement.

    (2) Regardless of urban or rural areas, when carrying out patriotic ideological education to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, attention must be paid to distinguishing between enemies, friends, and ourselves. Propaganda and education on the three aspects of enemies, friends, and ourselves cannot be neglected. It is very necessary to fully and comprehensively expose U.S. imperialism. If the ideological connection with U.S. imperialism is not severed, patriotic thought cannot be consolidated. However, if insufficient attention is paid to publicizing the greatness and loveliness of our people's motherland, it will not be easy for the broad masses to believe in their own strength, and the ideas of fearing, worshipping, and being close to the United States will not be easily eradicated. True ideas of hating, despising, and scorning the United States cannot be established. However, if only the above two aspects of work are carried out without paying attention to introducing the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the masses will not be able to recognize the strength of the world peace and democracy camp, and narrow nationalism may grow. After patriotic education has progressed to a certain extent, the movement must continue to deepen. Experience over the past few months has proven that patriotic sentiment must be combined with class education among the working masses. The issue of revolutionary outlook on life must be further resolved among young students and new cadres. Cadres from old liberated areas should strengthen theoretical study and enrich their knowledge level to overcome paralysis, blindness, and indifference. The harm of this blind optimism not only prevents one from making progress, but more importantly, it relaxes the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and obscures the sense of responsibility for educating the masses. Among the peasants, it is necessary to combine the accusation of the landlord class with the accusation of Chiang Kai-shek, the United States, and Japanese invaders, and to combine class hatred with national hatred.

    (3) After conducting accusations, self-ideological criticism should be further carried out. Our results in organized masses are often failures. The reason is that the general old area cadres feel that they have nothing to criticize, and the new cadres are afraid to boldly expose their thoughts because of their careers, so that the ideological criticism movement has stagnated for nearly two months. Based on two months of exploration, we feel that to continue to deepen in the future, we must start with the self-criticism of old cadres, lead all organ cadres, and then widely conduct it among organized masses. Facts have also proved that old cadres hate the United States far less than they hate Japan, and there are many incorrect ideas. In addition, although ideological criticism is carried out on the basis of a considerable degree of awareness among the masses, it has a more detailed and complex nature, so it must be effective only after arduous educational and organizational work. It is by no means possible to easily carry it out simply because the masses have a considerable degree of awareness.

    (4) The movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in cities is easier to carry out among organized masses, and the main sign of whether this movement is widespread and in-depth is to involve unorganized general residents in the movement. According to the experience of Nanchang and Jiujiang, it is not too difficult to carry out the work of organizing residents (Jiujiang organized 228 resident study groups, with 7,246 participants). The main experience is: (1) After the movement begins, although the focus is on organized masses, at the same time, a large number of propaganda teams (organ cadres, workers, students, teachers, etc.) can be organized to divide areas and carry out general propaganda to give the masses initial enlightenment; (2) After carrying out general propaganda, the residents' groups can be organized through the police station (without district government), and the residents' groups can be turned into study groups. Then, the residents' group leaders are given short-term training in batches by district to conduct in-depth propaganda through them. In this way, the movement will gradually unfold among the general residents.

　　江西省抗美援朝运动普遍展开
    中共江西省委宣传部
    从去年十一月开始，江西全省在和平签名运动的基础上，掀起了抗美援朝保家卫国运动。这个运动由城市逐步推向广大农村，从二月初迄今，已在全省各个角落普遍展开。
  对抗美援朝运动的估计
    经过几个月抗美援朝运动的开展，群众，特别是城市群众的思想有了显著的提高。
    由于反复地揭露了敌人罪行，宣传了和平阵营力量的强大，一般群众的崇美、亲美思想基本上打掉了，恐美思想已大大减少。仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义的思想已开始建立，对苏联也有了进一步的认识。过去有些人盲目仇苏、反苏的思想有了转变，亲苏思想开始建立。对世界和平力量与中国人民力量的强大与帝国主义本质上的脆弱有了进一步的认识，提高了民族自尊心、自信心和胜利信心，群众开始意识到自己已作了强国的国民了。经过抗美援朝爱国主义的思想教育，群众，特别是工人、青年学生对国家民族的责任感加强了，城市中很多工厂企业开展了爱国主义生产竞赛运动，并已出现了很多英雄事迹。如樟树铁路工人由日产六十个道钉升至一百一十；九江福泰厂由月产大牵拉机三部提高至六部，每月节省数千万元；九江瓷厂产量提高一倍，减少废品百分之五。青年学生参加军事干部学校很踊跃，有的母亲为儿子赶治沙眼；绝大多数父母认为儿女在新中国参加军事干部学校是最光荣的。农村经过各县区劳动模范的选举，也广泛地开展了爱国主义生产竞赛。
    在抗美援朝运动中，截至三月十五日止，全省据不完全统计，已写了慰问信二九二四三封，捐献慰问品四六○八二件（内有慰问袋八○八五件），劝募寒衣二十六万套，慰劳金一、六二七、○九○、八○八元。报名参加朝鲜志愿军的有九七七人，报名参加军事干部学校的有九六六○人，基督教徒签名赞成革新者有四四九八人（占全省的一半），天主教徒有八六一○人（占全省的十分之一）。这些数字也说明广大群众中爱国主义思想的高涨。
    抗美援朝运动中主要缺点是：（一）运动发展得不平衡：城市较普遍深入，乡村较差；城市一般以学生中工作最好，工人次之（这是很大缺陷），其他阶层更次之；揭露美帝国主义较多，对苏联及祖国的宣传较少。（二）在揭露与控诉了美帝国主义之后，联系进行个人思想批判不够，与实际工作结合、有意识地强调把热情变为力量不够。有系统地从理论上与实际上进行教育不够。一般群众本质的认识少，因此思想还不巩固。
  几点经验
    （一）几个月来经验证明领导机关的重视与否，是不是从思想上认识了抗美援朝的重要性，是开展抗美援朝运动好坏的重要关键。有的地方过去工作基础并不好，由于领导干部重视，抗美援朝运动搞得好，各种工作也随之有了起色。最重要的，在于领导上要很好地把中心工作与抗美援朝运动结合起来，密切注意时事的发展与群众的思想动态，作及时地布置与指导。一切认为提倡爱国群众自然会拥护，不必用大力推动，对运动听之任之的错误思想与作法，都会使运动失败。
    （二）不论城乡，开展抗美援朝的爱国主义思想教育时，必须注意划清敌友我界限。敌友我三方面的宣传教育不可偏废。充分地多方面地揭露美帝国主义是非常必要的，在思想上不割断与美帝国主义的联系，爱国主义思想就不能巩固建立。但对我们人民祖国的伟大与可爱不注意多方宣传，就不易使广大群众相信自己的力量，恐美、崇美、亲美的思想就不易根除，真正的仇美、鄙美、蔑美思想就不能树立。但仅有以上两方面的工作而不注意介绍苏联及人民民主国家，就不能使群众认识世界和平民主阵营的力量，就可能滋长狭隘的民族主义思想。在爱国主义教育进行到一定程度后，要使运动继续深入。几个月的经验证明：在工人群众中必须把爱国主义与阶级教育结合起来。在青年学生与新干部中必须进一步解决革命人生观问题。在老解放区来的干部中，要加强理论学习与丰富自己知识水平，以克服麻痹盲目毫不在乎的情绪。这种盲目乐观情绪的害处不仅使自己不进步，更重要的是因此放松了抗美援朝的工作，模糊了教育群众的责任感。在农民中要由近及远，把控诉地主阶级与控诉蒋、美、日寇结合起来，把阶级仇恨与民族仇恨结合起来。
    （三）在进行控诉后，应进一步进行自我思想批判。我们在有组织的群众中进行的结果，很多都失败了。原因是一般老区干部感到自己无什么批判的，新干部顾及职业问题不敢大胆暴露思想，以致近两月来思想批判运动始终停滞不前。根据两个月的摸索，我们感到今后要继续深入，必须从老干部的自我批判开始，带领起全体机关干部，再在有组织的群众中广泛进行。事实又证明老干部仇美远不如仇日，存在着很多不正确思想。另外，思想批判虽是在群众有相当觉悟的基础上进行，但因带有更细致、更复杂的性质，故必须经过艰苦的教育组织工作，才能奏效，绝不是由于群众有了相当的觉悟程度，就可轻而易举地搞起来的。
    （四）城市中的抗美援朝运动在有组织的群众中比较容易开展，而这运动普遍深入与否的主要标志，在于使无组织的一般居民卷入运动。根据南昌、九江的经验，开展居民组织工作并不是太困难的（九江组织居民学习小组二二八个，参加学习者七二四六人）。主要经验是：（１）运动开始后，虽重点放在有组织的群众，但同时即可组织人数多的宣传队伍（机关干部、工人、学生、教员等），划分地区分头进行一般宣传，使群众得到初步启发；（２）经过进行一般宣传后，即可通过派出所（无区政府）把居民小组组织起来，把居民小组变为学习小组。再把居民小组长分区分批给以短期训练，通过他们深入宣传。这样，运动就会逐渐在一般居民中开展起来。
