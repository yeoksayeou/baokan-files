Liaoxi Province Cooperatives' Experience in Signing Exchange Contracts
Editor:

Prior to November of last year, cooperatives at all levels in Liaoxi Province did not implement purchase and sales exchange contracts, resulting in many areas being unable to sell goods despite having them, while certain areas in need of those goods were unable to purchase them. This not only hindered the exchange of materials but also caused losses to the masses. For example, in early April of last year, the Liaoxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased more than 5,000 jin of "Anli" pears from lower-level cooperatives. Because they could not be sold, they had to be transported to Shenyang and sold to private merchants. At that time, the Shuangliao County Supply and Marketing Cooperative needed pears, so they bought this batch of pears from the private merchants at a high price. This increased the unnecessary burden on the members of the Shuangliao County cooperative. To address this, at the end of November last year, the Liaoxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative convened a meeting on the issue of material exchange. Through this meeting, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed 49 purchase contracts with city and county cooperatives, worth more than 94.46 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below). Various cities and counties, or county and county cooperatives, also signed exchange and ordering contracts worth nearly 10 billion yuan. This has greatly promoted the sideline production and material exchange of the masses. Due to the signing of these contracts, Siping City's edible oil has found a market, and Jinxi, Shanhaiguan, and other places are no longer short of oil. Members who grow peanuts can therefore exchange them for grain of equal value.

In this contract signing process, we have the following points of experience that can be offered for reference by various localities:

First, cooperatives at all levels should frequently convene meetings on exchange and purchase contracts to regulate the materials among cooperatives within the city (county) to achieve vertical and horizontal communication.

Second, when signing contracts, it is necessary to eliminate the idea of profit-seeking and strengthen the overall concept. According to our experience, sellers often demand very high prices, while buyers try to lower the prices as much as possible, both sides believing that this is serving the members. In fact, raising prices will inevitably affect sales, making it impossible to develop sideline production. Therefore, both parties must implement the principle of mutual benefit.

Third, product specifications must meet the needs of sales. For example, the masses in Changbei County are accustomed to weaving "four-six" mats (suitable for laying on kang beds), while the public sector needs "zhang" mats. Because the specifications are not suitable, the result is that the public sector is eager to buy, but the masses have mats but cannot sell them. It is therefore necessary to educate the masses to change the old product specifications to solve the sales problem.

Fourth, when holding contract signing meetings, you can also contact local government agencies and enterprises to sign exchange contracts more widely. For example, the Water Conservancy Bureau needs earth baskets and carrying poles, and the Grain Company needs mats. These are products of sideline production of the masses in some areas and can be supplied according to the contract.

Fifth, a comprehensive inspection should be conducted on the contracts that have been signed, and their implementation should be strictly supervised. For example, the contract signed between Kaiyuan County and Xingcheng County to exchange sorghum for jute seeds was voided by one party for no reason because the relevant parties failed to strictly supervise its implementation. This should be criticized and dealt with appropriately.

### 辽西省合作社签订交换合同的经验

　　辽西省合作社签订交换合同的经验编辑同志：
    去年十一月以前，辽西各级合作社之间没有实行购销交换合同，致使很多地方有货无法销出，而某些需要该项货物的地区又无法购得。这不仅阻碍了物资交流，同时也使群众吃了亏。如去年四月初，辽西省供销合作总社由下级社收购了“安梨”五千多斤，因为无法销售，只得运到沈阳卖给私营货栈。当时双辽县供销合作社正需要梨，所以又从私营货栈将这批梨以高价买去。这就增加了双辽县的合作社员不必要的负担。为此，去年十一月底，辽西省供销合作总社召开了有关物资交换问题的会议，通过这次会议，省供销合作总社与市、县合作社之间，签订了四十九个收购合同，价值九百四十四亿六千多万元（东北币、下同）。各市与各县或县与县合作社之间也签订了价值约近百亿元的交换与订货合同。这对于群众的副业生产与物资交流起了很大的推动作用。由于这些合同的签订，四平市的食油已有了销路，锦西、山海关等地也不缺油吃了。种花生的社员因此能换到等价的粮食。
    在这次订合同中，我们有以下的几点经验，可以提出供各地参考：
    第一，各级合作社经常召开有关交换与收购合同的会议，以调剂本市（县）内各合作社间的物资达到纵横互相通气。
    第二，签订合同时必须肃清营利思想，加强整体观念。根据我们的经验，出卖者往往要求的价格很高，而收购者就尽量地压低价格，双方都认为这是为社员服务。其实，提高了价格，就必然影响销路，使副业生产无法开展。因此，双方必须贯彻两利的原则。
    第三，产品的规格要服从销路的需要。如昌北县群众惯编“四六”席子（适合铺炕用），而公家需要的是“丈”席。因为规格不适合，结果是公家急于收买，而群众有席又卖不出。这就必须教育群众改变旧有的产品规格，以解决销售问题。
    第四，举行签订合同的会议时，还可以与当地机关、企业单位互相联系，以便更广泛地签订交换合同。如水利局需要土筐、扁担，粮食公司需要席子，这些又是某些地区群众副业生产的产品，可以根据合同供应。
    第五，应对已经签订的合同进行普遍的检查，严格督促其实现。像开原县与兴城县订立的以高粱交换洋麻籽的合同，因有关方面未进行严格督促，致有一方无故作废。对此应予以批评并适当处理。
