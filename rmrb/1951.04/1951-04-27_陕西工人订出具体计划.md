　　Workers in both state-owned and private factories in Xi'an and Shaanxi Province have drawn up plans to welcome the "May Day" holiday. In addition to proposing to strengthen current affairs propaganda, hold meetings to support the signing of a peace treaty and vote against the US arming of Japan, and denounce the atrocities of special agents, these plans also focus on assisting the People's Government in exposing counter-revolutionaries, strengthening internal security and protection work in factories, and creating new production records. For example, employees of the Xi'an People's Power Plant guaranteed to "not stop electricity for a second" before May Day. Xi'an postal and telecommunications workers guaranteed to send and receive 50,000 pieces of mail without errors. The Automotive Repair Factory of the Logistics Department guaranteed to overfulfill its April production target by 30 percent. In addition, each unit also specifically stipulated methods for preparing "May Day" propaganda activities in the plans, and guaranteed to mobilize all employees and as many employee family members as possible to participate in the "May Day" demonstrations.
    To realize these plans, factory workers are actively launching competitions. According to statistics, more than 30 factories have published challenge letters for the competition in newspapers. In the competition, the yarn output per spindle of the Dahua Yarn Factory has exceeded the original guarantee condition of 0.82 pounds, reaching 0.822 pounds. The yarn output per spindle of the Shenxin Yarn Factory increased by 8.8% in two weeks, and the cloth output of the looms also increased by 16%, creating the highest new record since the factory was established.

　　陕西工人订出具体计划
    西安市及陕西省各公私营工厂职工都已订出迎接“五一”节的计划。这些计划除提出要加强时事宣传，举行拥护缔结和平公约签名和反对美国武装日本投票、控诉特务暴行的大会外，并着重提出要协助人民政府检举反革命分子，加强工厂内保密保卫工作，创造新的生产纪录。如西安市人民发电厂职工保证“五一”前不停一秒钟的电。西安邮电职工保证收寄五万件邮件不出差错。后勤部汽车修理厂保证超额完成四月份生产任务百分之三十。此外，各单位在计划中还具体规定准备“五一”宣传活动的办法，并保证动员全体职工及尽可能多的职工家属参加“五一”大示威。
    为实现这些计划，现在各工厂职工正纷纷展开竞赛。据统计已有三十多个工厂在报纸上发表了竞赛的挑战书。在竞赛运动中，大华纱厂每锭产纱量已超过零点八二磅的原保证条件，达到零点八二二磅。申新纱厂每锭产纱量两周内提高百分之八点八强，布机产布量也提高了百分之十六，创造建厂以来的最高新纪录。
