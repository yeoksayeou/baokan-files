Several Understandings from Our Visit After the Land Reform
Tianjin Municipal Land Reform Visiting Group

Our group departed from Tianjin on February 26th to visit the land reform work in the Central South District. After brief stays in Hankou and Changsha, we gained a preliminary understanding of the land reform situation in the Central South District, especially in Hunan Province. All members then decided to visit Yiyang, Hunan. We stayed in Yiyang for half a month, visiting Baimashan Township, Yuetang Township, Kuaihuling Township, and Bailupu Township successively. We stayed in Yuetang Township for one week.

In this area we selected ourselves, we personally witnessed the most thorough and largest change in Chinese history over thousands of years—changing the feudal and exploitative land ownership system to a peasant land ownership system, fundamentally overthrowing the set of social systems under the brutal rule of the landlord class, and ending an era in history. This is a great historical victory in the process of the Chinese revolution, and the basic content of the New Democratic Revolution at the present stage. We are deeply grateful that in such a torrent of the anti-feudal movement of millions of peasants, we can stand in the growing ranks of the fighting peasants, feeling infinitely excited and infinitely glorious. At the same time, the refreshed countryside has created fundamental conditions for the improvement of our country's financial and economic situation. We are even more full of confidence in the future of New China's construction.

Although our stay in the countryside was short, we roughly saw the basic steps of carrying out land reform, closely contacted local peasants, continuously participated in peasant anti-despot rallies and class division meetings, held several peasant forums and gatherings respectively, visited poor peasant and farmhand families successively, and finally visited the production movement unfolded by the emancipated peasants. During this period, we also listened to various reports from leading organs at any time.

Here, it must first be explained that before our group departed from Tianjin, we did hear some opinions that doubted land reform and arguments that defended the landlord class; on the other hand, at that time, we ourselves still had some vague understandings and one-sided views on land reform. However, facts speak louder than words, and the truth cannot be distorted. All the facts we personally witnessed during this visit fundamentally refuted various views that doubted land reform and shattered various arguments that defended the feudal and exploitative system and the landlord class. What is even more gratifying is that our own understanding of land reform has gradually become clear. This is truly a beneficial test and education for us.

Based on all the facts we have personally seen and heard and the materials we have personally collected, after repeated discussions and research, the members of our group have fully reached a common and unanimous opinion on the following key points. Now, we hereby submit a summary report for the reference of all parties concerned about the issue of land reform.

            I. Further Understanding of the Basic Content of Land Reform

First of all, the members of our visiting group have further understood the basic content of land reform. Land reform is the most basic historical task of the Chinese revolution, and it is also "a systematic and fierce struggle." Through this visit, we have gained a relatively deep understanding of these two points of significance. The members of our group unanimously affirm that in order to eliminate the landlord as a social class, to consolidate the victory of the people's revolution, to liberate rural productive forces, to develop agricultural production, and to open up roads for the industrialization of New China, it is necessary to follow the predetermined general line of land reform and resolutely carry out this earth-shaking great struggle.

That is to say, to complete land reform, it is necessary to boldly mobilize the broad masses of the people and launch a comprehensive class struggle.

That is to say, the landlord class will never willingly move towards extinction on its own, and only when the peasant masses rise up and carry out fierce struggles against the landlords with leadership and in a step-by-step manner can the landlord class be defeated and the feudal and exploitative system be destroyed.

It is true that the revolution has been victorious throughout the country, but in the countryside, the landlord class still rules their rural "small world" and still maintains a system for cruelly oppressing the peasants. Through our on-the-spot investigation in the countryside this time, it has been proven that until the eve of carrying out land reform, the landlord class still relied on the fierce flames of its long-term rule to occupy political advantages and economic privileges in the countryside, possessing private armed forces, maintaining reactionary organizations, and occupying so-called "ideological and cultural" positions specifically designed to numb and deceive the peasants. In a word, the landlord class still fiercely and violently rides on the heads of the peasants. To change this situation, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses of peasants ideologically and carry out a great peasant emancipation to thoroughly eliminate the landlord class.

In many peasant forums, on the one hand, we recognized the cruel exploitation of the landlord class, such as unexpectedly high land rents, numerous exorbitant extractions, and shocking deposits and "snowballing" usury, which kept the poor peasants and farmhands struggling on the line of starvation forever; on the other hand, we further recognized that many landlords are bad guys combined of bandits, heads of feudal secret societies, and reactionary party and league members. Taking Yuetang Township in Yiyang County as an example: among the thirteen large landlords, three had served as puppet bao chiefs, jia chiefs, and puppet township cadres, and four had served as puppet battalion commanders, company commanders, and commissioners of the Kuomintang. They ran rampant in the countryside, harmed the people, and embodied the culmination of human evil. At the same time, we further recognized another important fact: the landlord class has always been the main accomplice of imperialism in carrying out aggression and rule in China. Last year, when the Korean War broke out, the reactionary landlord class unscrupulously counterattacked the people, spreading rumors and intimidating them, and were ready to make trouble. This precisely shows that the landlord class and imperialism are interdependent, and it also shows that China's victorious struggle against imperialism and feudalism is inseparable. Now that imperialism has been driven out of mainland China, and China and peace-loving people all over the world are fighting a life-and-death battle with the crazy imperialists, we must fundamentally eliminate the feudal landlord class at this time and smash the social foundation on which imperialism relies to carry out aggression within China.

Even in the process of land reform, we must never underestimate the landlord class's stubborn resistance and destructive actions. They kill working cadres, disperse and destroy property, such as demolishing houses, killing cattle, destroying farm tools, cutting down trees, burying rice, and even throwing daily utensils into ponds. A landlord in Xiangxiang County burned 12,000 trees in one fell swoop. Landlords also have the ability to disperse property in miraculous ways: a large landlord in Yuetang Township who owned thirty piculs of fields dispersed his property so that his family was destitute and his room had no grain. Many landlords' families had only one pot, three bricks, and a bed of straw left. Moreover, landlords even dared to sprinkle salt and put nails in the fields that were confiscated, and bury bombs and hand grenades in chests and farm tools. Similar insidious and vicious methods, and the crimes of destroying social wealth, are extremely common in various villages. Someone has counted that there are at least a hundred types of tyrannical cunning and despicable and vile soft and hard tricks that landlords use to sabotage land reform. This can explain a glimpse of the landlord's resistance and sabotage actions, and from this, we can further recognize the sinful nature of the landlord class.

Therefore, the members of our visiting group clearly recognized this truth: to eliminate the landlord class, it is necessary to boldly mobilize the masses, wholeheartedly rely on the masses, and carry out a series of fierce struggles against the landlords. If we deviate from the mass struggle and fantasize about "peaceful land distribution," we will commit a major political error, and the result will inevitably lead to the failure of land reform.

Every step of land reform is a kind of struggle. Before the land reform, the clearing of bandits and anti-despot struggles, the transformation of rural political power, the establishment of peasant associations, the organization of militias, and the rent reduction and deposit refund movement were the preliminary development of the struggle. During land reform, the poor peasant and farmhand teams were first organized to improve their level of awareness, the peasant associations were further consolidated and became purer, and then the struggle against despots was carried out, the lawless landlords were suppressed, and the prestige of the landlord power faction was defeated, gradually guiding the struggle into a climax. Class division is a struggle. This is to divide the line between exploitation and being exploited. At this stage, the peasants' level of awareness and the content of the struggle were raised a step further, from hating individual landlords to hating the landlord class. Finally, confiscation, requisition, and distribution were carried out, which was also a step in the struggle. This step must also be combined with the struggle against sabotage, anti-concealment, and anti-dispersion. Then, it is necessary to recover field deeds and continue to control the landlords.

Regarding the scenes of these struggles, we were greatly moved and gained deep impressions when we participated in the anti-despot rally in Kuaihuling Township, Yiyang County, and the class division meeting in Yuetang Township. Through this education and test, we further recognized that mobilizing the masses to launch a struggle is the right path to complete land reform.

            II. Correctly Implementing the Laws and Decrees Promulgated by the Government and the Policies and Guidelines Determined by It

Secondly, the members of our visiting group deeply recognized that in this struggle, the working cadres and the peasant masses correctly implemented the laws and decrees promulgated by the Central People's Government and governments at all levels and the policies and guidelines determined by it.

Land reform work is carried out step by step and orderly along the right track. No chaos has occurred in various regions, and there have been no major deviations—although some minor deviations are inevitable, they can be immediately and resolutely corrected.

We can completely affirm that in land reform work, policies and actions are consistent, theory and practice are consistent, and the upper-level leading organs are consistent with the lower-level working cadres. This is a point that we unanimously found satisfactory during our visit.

The reason why such achievements can be made is mainly due to the correct implementation of the general line of land reform of "relying on poor peasants and farmhands, uniting with middle peasants, neutralizing rich peasants, and eliminating the landlord class"; it is mainly due to the implementation of the basic method of "from point to surface, combining point and surface" to gradually carry out work; it is mainly because the backbone of land reform—active elements among poor peasants and farmhands and working cadres sent to the countryside—can mobilize the masses and correctly lead them.

The facts we saw in the four townships of Yiyang County fully show that not only can the cadre comrades grasp the policies, but the peasant masses can also grasp the policies. We have examples to prove that the struggle of the peasant masses generally does not exceed the scope of rationality and legality, and they can still appropriately grasp the situation reasonably and legally in the climax of fighting against despots and fighting against lawless landlords. The peasant masses can distinguish between different people in the landlord class, recognize the boundaries between the enemy and ourselves and friends, and firmly implement the policies of preserving the rich peasant economy and protecting industry and commerce, so the rich peasants are at ease and urban and rural industry and commerce are not affected by rural struggles. Many industries and businesses in Changsha and Wuhan are related to the landlord class. In the early stage of land reform, due to peasants entering the city to settle accounts with the landlords, individual shops and factories were implicated, but the Central South Military and Political Committee then promulgated relevant laws and established urban and rural liaison offices, so the concerns of the industrial and commercial circles in this regard were quickly eliminated. In this way, on the one hand, the revolutionary order in the countryside was maintained, and on the other hand, the united front against feudalism was consolidated.

The struggle against despots and lawless landlords generally adopts rational and legal methods such as pouring out grievances and calculating exploitation accounts, forcing them to bow their heads to the people, and, if necessary, sending them to the people's court for punishment according to law. Although incidents of beating and torture have been discovered in individual places, they have been promptly corrected.

We would like to emphasize one more point: the members of our group have gained an extremely profound and indelible impression of the work style of the cadre comrades. These large group of cadres who are carrying out land reform work truly demonstrate their infinite loyalty to the people's cause. They go to the countryside regardless of danger and hardship, and steadily and patiently mobilize the peasant masses ideologically and extensively and deeply connect with the peasant masses. In all aspects of life and work, they fully demonstrate a simple and hard-working work style and extremely excellent qualities. Their serious and responsible attitude in work, as well as their deep understanding and careful mastery of policies, deeply moved the members of our visiting group. What is even more gratifying is that they have also tempered themselves and improved themselves in the raging fire of land reform. We firmly believe that this large group of working cadre comrades will be able to complete the arduous task of land reform satisfactorily and happily.

            III. The Rural Atmosphere is Completely New After the Completion of Land Reform

Furthermore, the members of our visiting group were very excited to see that the rural atmosphere that completed land reform was truly new.

The emancipated peasants are politically organized, and their political enthusiasm has been greatly improved. The broad masses of peasants love the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. "Thanks to Chairman Mao, we have been emancipated" (note: "thanks to" means "thanks to"). This passionate and loud voice can be heard at any time in every corner of the countryside.

The people's democratic dictatorship in the countryside has been gradually consolidated. Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's special agents are constantly being denounced by the peasants, and they have no place to hide in the countryside anymore. According to reports from various places, combined with land reform, many special agent cases have been uncovered one after another. This proves that land reform has laid a solid foundation for the nationwide suppression of counter-revolutionary activities.

Among the emancipated peasant masses, countless touching deeds of loving the motherland naturally emerged. The movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has been widely and deeply developed in the countryside. We personally saw an elderly couple encouraging their son to join the glorious ranks under Chairman Mao's banner. Many peasants said to us: "Good people must guard the gate for the country"! Everywhere we went in the countryside, examples of glorious military service were circulating. The peasants who have been liberated from the oppression of the feudal system have the determination and confidence to defend the motherland, defend the fruits of the people's revolution, defend world peace, and defeat all provocations of imperialism.

"Every step of land reform must effectively take care of and closely combine with the development of rural production." The emancipated peasants have greatly improved their enthusiasm for production. In the Yiyang countryside, where the small mountains are like screens and the paddy fields are like mirrors, we saw the peasants who had obtained land and other means of production happily and freely working on the free land. They are full of hope and confidence in the prospects of their lives.

Of course, the poor peasants and farmhands still have many practical difficulties temporarily after being allocated land, but they have the determination to overcome these difficulties by relying on their own strength. Regarding the issues of fertilizer, seeds, farm tools, and cattle this year, the peasants have some plans and arrangements, mainly relying on their own hard work, combined with the spirit of mutual assistance among everyone, to seek appropriate solutions. Publicity and challenges such as guaranteeing more grain production this year and guaranteeing more industrial raw material production are gradually unfolding in the countryside. In the suburbs of Yiyang City, we saw thousands of peasants repairing dikes in a tense and pleasant atmosphere; in Bailupu Township, we saw the moving scenes of plowing fields, harrowing the land, carrying manure, and so on. We deeply appreciate the excited mood of these warriors on the production battlefield.

At the same time, the peasants are eager to learn culture. According to the principle of running schools by the township, primary schools are rapidly increasing. Poor peasants and farmhands are eager for their children to go to school. Winter schools were established, and peasants enthusiastically attended classes. Taking Bailupu Township as an example, 609 people enrolled in winter schools in one week. Now, the winter schools have been changed to peasant spare-time schools, and many adult men and women are enthusiastically striving for this opportunity to receive education. In order to meet the needs of the peasants, Xinhua Bookstore has set up mobile book stalls in townships.

Finally, during this visit to the south by the members of our group, we received warm hospitality and sincere guidance from the leaders of leading organs at all levels in the Central South District and working cadres in various places, which provided us with great convenience and helped our work. At the same time, the peasants of various townships in Yiyang warmly welcomed our visit. As soon as we met, they regarded us as family, talked about everyday matters, shared their thoughts, and were kind, harmonious, frank, and sincere, which not only moved us exceptionally but also enabled our work to go deeper. During this trip, the places we passed through and the comrades we contacted all gave us unforgettable impressions, making us truly feel the warmth of the big family under Chairman Mao's leadership.

Hereby, we sincerely extend our sincere gratitude and high respect to the leaders of leading organs at all levels, working cadre comrades in various places, and peasant brothers!

　　我们参观土地改革以后的几点认识
    天津市土地改革参观团
    本团于二月二十六日由天津出发，来中南区参观土地改革工作，经汉口、长沙小作勾留，对中南区特别是湖南省土地改革概况作初步了解，全体同人就决定到湖南益阳参观。在益阳留半个月，先后访问了白马山乡、月塘乡、快活岭乡和白鹿铺乡，其间有一个星期住在月塘乡。
    在自己选定的这一个地区，我们亲眼看见了中国历史上几千年来一次最彻底最大的变革——把封建剥削的土地所有制改变为农民的土地所有制，根本推翻了地主阶级残暴统治的一套社会制度，结束了历史上的一个时代。这是中国革命过程中一个伟大的历史性的胜利，是现阶段新民主主义革命的基本内容。我们深自庆幸，在这样一个千军万马的农民反封建大运动高潮中，自己能站在战斗的农民的壮大行列里，实感无限兴奋，无限光荣。同时，气象一新的农村，已为我们国家财政经济状况的好转创造了根本条件。我们对于新中国建设的前途更充满了信心。
    我们在乡村停留时间虽短，但是大体上看见了进行土地改革的几个基本步骤，亲切接触了当地农民，连续参加了农民反恶霸大会和划分阶级成份大会，分别举行了几次农民座谈和联欢，先后访问了贫雇农家庭，最后参观了翻身农民展开生产运动的情况，其间并随时听取了领导机关同志的各项报告。
    这里先须说明：我们由天津出发以前，确曾听见了一些怀疑土地改革的意见以及为地主阶级辩护的议论；另一方面，我们自己那时候对于土地改革也还多少存在着一些模糊认识和片面看法。可是事实胜于雄辩，真理不容曲解，我们这次在参观中亲眼看见的一切事实，根本驳倒了对于土地改革怀疑的各种见解，粉碎了为封建剥削制度和地主阶级辩护的各种议论。更欣幸的，是我们自己对于土地改革的认识也逐步明确了。这对于我们真是一种有益的考验和教育。
    本团同人根据一切亲见亲闻的事实和亲自搜集的材料，经过反复讨论研究，对于以下所举各项要点，完全取得了共同一致的意见。现在谨作一个概括的报告，提供关心土地改革问题的各方面人士参考。
            一、进一步认识了土地改革的基本内容
    首先，我们参观团同人进一步认识了土地改革的基本内容。土地改革是中国革命中最基本的历史任务，同时也是“一场系统的激烈的斗争”。对于这两点意义，我们经过此次参观，已经有了比较深切的理解。本团同人一致地肯定：为了消灭地主这一个社会阶级，为了巩固人民革命的胜利，为了解放农村生产力，发展农业生产，并为新中国的工业化开辟道路，就必须循着预定的土地改革的总路线，坚决进行这一场翻天覆地的大斗争。
    这就是说，要完成土地改革，必须放手发动广大群众，展开全面阶级斗争。
    也就是说，地主阶级决不肯自己走向消灭，而必须农民群众翻身起来，有领导、有步骤地对地主进行猛烈斗争，才能打垮地主阶级。摧毁封建剥削制度。
    诚然，革命已在全国胜利了，然而在农村中，地主阶级依然统治着他们农村的“小天下”，依然保持着对于农民进行残酷压迫的一套制度。我们经过这次在乡村实地考察，证明直到进行土地改革的前夕，地主阶级依然凭借其长期统治的凶焰，在乡村占有政治优势和经济特权，拥有私人武装，保有反动组织，并据有专为麻醉欺骗农民的所谓“思想文化”阵地。一句话，地主阶级依然横暴凶猛地骑在农民头上。要改变这种形势，就必须从思想上发动广大农民，来一个农民大翻身，彻底消灭地主阶级。
    在许多次农民座谈会中，一方面我们认清了地主阶级的残酷剥削，例如出人意料的高地租，名目繁多的超额剥削，惊人的押金及“驴打滚”的高利贷等等，压得贫雇农民永远挣扎在饥饿线上；另一方面我们更认清了很多地主是匪首、封建会门头子和反动党团分子结合而成的四位一体的坏蛋。以益阳县月塘乡为例：十三户大地主中，就有三户当过伪保、甲长伪乡干事等职，四户当过国民党伪营长、连长、专员等职。他们横行乡里，残害人民，一身集人间罪恶之大成。同时，我们更认清另一个重要的事实：地主阶级一直是帝国主义在中国进行侵略统治的主要帮凶。去年朝鲜战事发生，反动的地主阶级肆无忌惮地向人民反攻，造谣威吓，蠢蠢欲动。这正说明地主阶级和帝国主义是相依为命的，也说明中国反帝与反封建的胜利斗争是不可分的。现在帝国主义已被赶出中国大陆，中国与全世界爱好和平的人民正与疯狂的帝国主义者作殊死战，我们此时必须根本铲除封建地主阶级，粉碎帝国主义在中国内部依以进行侵略的社会基础。
    就是在土地改革过程中，我们也决不可低估地主阶级的顽抗和破坏行动。他们杀害工作干部，疏散并破坏财产，例如拆房屋，杀耕牛，毁农具，砍树木，埋稻谷，乃至把日用器皿投入池塘。湘乡县一个地主一举烧树一万二千棵。地主疏散财产也有手眼通天的本领：月塘乡一个有三十石田的大地主，疏散得家徒四壁，室无颗粒。很多地主家中只剩一口锅，三块砖，一床稻草。而且地主竟敢在被没收的田里撒盐放钉，在衣箱、农具里埋伏炸弹和手榴弹。类此，阴狠恶毒的手段，破坏社会财富的罪恶，在各乡村都极普遍流行。有人统计，地主破坏土地改革的横暴狡猾以及卑鄙龌龊的软硬花样，至少有一百多种。这就可以说明地主顽抗和破坏行动的一斑，由此更可认清地主阶级罪恶的本质。
    因此，我们参观团同人明确认定了这一个真理：要消灭地主阶级，必须放手发动群众，全心依靠群众，对地主进行一系列的猛烈斗争。如果脱离群众斗争，幻想“和平分田”，就犯了政治上的重大错误，其结果必导引土地改革走向失败。
    土地改革的每一步骤，都是一种斗争。在土地改革以前，所进行的清土匪反恶霸，改造乡村政权，成立农民协会，组织民兵，以及减租退押运动，是斗争的初步开展。土地改革中，先组织贫雇农队伍，提高他们的觉悟水平，农民协会进一步巩固并趋于纯洁了，于是进而反恶霸，镇压不法地主，打垮地主当权派的威风，逐步引导斗争进入高潮。划分阶级是一场斗争。这是要划分剥削与被剥削的界线。农民在这个阶段，由仇视个别地主进而仇视地主阶级，觉悟水平和斗争内容都提高了一步。最后进行没收、征收和分配，也是斗争中的一个步骤。这一个步骤，还须结合着反破坏、反隐瞒、反疏散的斗争。接着还要追缴田契，继续管制地主。
    关于这些斗争的场面，我们在参加益阳县快活岭乡反恶霸大会和月塘乡划阶级大会的时候，都受到很大的感动，获得深刻的印象。通过这个教育和考验，我们更认清了发动群众展开斗争是完成土地改革的正轨大道。
            二、正确地执行政府所颁布的法令及其所决定的方针政策
    其次，我们参观团同人深切认识：在这一场斗争中，工作干部和农民群众都正确地执行了中央人民政府和各级人民政府所颁布的法令及其所决定的方针政策。
    土地改革工作是有步骤、有秩序地循着正轨进行的。各地区没有发生混乱现象，没有出大偏差，——虽然不免一些小偏差，也都能立即坚决纠正。
    我们可以完全肯定：在土地改革工作中，政策与行动一致，理论与实践一致，上级领导机关与下级工作干部一致。这是我们在参观中所一致认为满意的一点。
    所以能有这样的成绩，主要是由于正确执行了“依靠贫农、雇农，团结中农，中立富农，消灭地主阶级”的土地改革总路线；主要是由于贯彻了“由点到面，点面结合”逐步展开工作的基本方法；主要是由于土地改革中的骨干——贫雇农民中的积极分子和派在乡村中的工作干部——能够发动群众并正确加以领导。
    我们在益阳县四个乡所看见的事实，充分说明不仅干部同志能掌握政策，农民群众也能掌握政策。我们有实例证明：农民群众的斗争大体不超出合理合法的范围，在斗恶霸与斗不法地主的高潮中仍能准情酌理地适当掌握，农民群众能区别对待地主阶级的不同人等，能认清敌我和朋友的界线，能坚定执行保存富农经济和保护工商业政策，所以富农安心而城市乡镇工商业不因农村斗争蒙受影响。长沙、武汉工商业很多与地主阶级有关联，在土地改革初期，由于农民进城与地主算账，个别商店工厂或被牵连，但是中南军政委员会接着就颁布了有关的法令，成立了城乡联络处，于是工商界在这一方面的顾虑很快就消除了。这样，一面保持了农村的革命秩序，另一面也就巩固了反封建的统一战线。
    对于恶霸和不法地主的斗争，一般采取吐苦水、算剥削账等合理合法的方式，迫令他们向人民低头，必要时并依法送人民法庭惩治。吊打事件，虽然个别地方曾有发现，但已及时实行纠正。
    我们愿更着重说明一点：对于干部工作同志的作风，本团同人都获得极深刻而不可磨灭的印象。这些进行土地改革工作的大群干部，真正表现了对人民事业的无限忠心。他们不避危险、不辞辛苦地到乡村去，踏实地耐心地从思想上发动农民群众，广泛而深入地联系农民群众。他们在生活、工作种种方面，充分表现了朴素刻苦的作风和极其优秀的品质。他们在工作中严肃负责的态度，以及对于政策的深切体会和谨慎掌握，深深地感动了我们参观团同人。更可喜的是在土地改革的烈火中，他们还锻炼了自己，提高了自己。我们深信这一大群工作干部同志必能胜任愉快地完成土地改革这一艰巨的工作。
            三、完成土地改革的农村气象一新
    再其次，我们参观团同人很兴奋地看见完成土地改革的农村真是气象一新了。
    翻身的农民在政治上组织起来了，政治的积极性大大提高了。广大农民们热爱共产党，热爱毛主席。“搭帮毛主席，我们翻了身”（按“搭帮”即“多亏”的意思）。这充满着热情的响亮声音，在农村每一个角落都随时听见了。
    农村的人民民主专政逐步巩固了。蒋介石匪帮特务分子不断被农民检举出来，他们在乡村再没有藏身之地了。根据各地报告，结合着土地改革，陆续破获了不少特务案件。这证明土地改革为全国镇压反革命活动打下了一个坚固的基础。
    在翻身的农民群众中，很自然地涌现出无数热爱祖国的动人事迹。抗美援朝运动广泛而深入地在农村展开。我们亲眼看见一对老年父母鼓舞儿子去投入毛主席旗帜下的光荣队伍。很多农民向我们说：“好人要为国家去守卫大门”！我们所到乡村，处处流传着光荣参军一类的事例。由封建制度压迫下解放出来的农民，有决心，也有信心保卫祖国，保卫人民革命的胜利果实，保卫世界和平，打败帝国主义的一切挑衅。
    “土地改革的每一个步骤，必须切实照顾并密切结合于农村生产的发展”。翻身的农民大大提高了生产的积极性。在小山如屏、水田似镜的益阳农村，我们看见了获得土地和其他生产资料的农民，在自由的土地上，欢欣鼓舞地自由工作着。他们对于自己生活的前景，充满着希望和信心。
    当然，贫雇农在分得土地以后，暂时仍有不少具体困难，可是他们具有依靠自己力量克服这些困难的决心。关于今年肥料、种籽、农具、耕牛等问题，农民各有一些计划安排，主要是依靠自己的勤奋，结合着大家互助的精神，以求适当地解决。保证今年多产粮食，保证多产工业原料，这一类宣传和挑战，在农村中逐步展开了。我们在益阳市郊，看见成千的农民紧张愉快地修堤；在白鹿铺乡，看见翻田、耙地、担粪等等搞生产的动人场面。我们深切体会了这些生产战场上勇士们的兴奋心情。
    同时，农民热切要学习文化。根据乡学乡办的原则，小学迅速增加。贫雇农热望儿女入学读书。冬学成立，农民踊跃听课。以白鹿铺乡为例，一星期就有六百零九人在冬学报名。现在冬学改为农民业余学校，多少成年男女正热心争取这个受教育的机会。新华书店为适应农民的要求，在乡镇中设立了流动售书站。
              ×                    ×                    ×
    最后，这次本团同人南下参观，承中南区各级领导机关首长和各地工作干部同志殷勤招待，恳切指导，给了我们极大的便利，帮助了我们的工作。同时，益阳各乡农民热烈欢迎我们参观，一见面就把我们看作一家人，话家常，谈心事，亲切融洽，坦率诚恳，这不仅使我们异常感动，也使我们的工作得以比较深入下去。在这次参观行程中，我们所经过的地方，所接触的同志，都给我们以永不能忘的印象，使我们真切感觉到毛主席领导下大家庭的温暖。
    谨于此掬诚向各级领导机关首长、各地工作干部同志以及农民弟兄们，致恳挚的感谢和崇高的敬意！
