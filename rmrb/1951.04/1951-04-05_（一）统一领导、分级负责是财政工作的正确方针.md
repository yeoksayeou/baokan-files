(I) Unified Leadership, Responsibility at Each Level: A Correct Guideline for Financial Work
    The Government Administration Council promulgated on March 29th the decision on the division of the 1951 fiscal revenue and expenditure system. This decision adopts the principle of unified leadership and responsibility at each level for the national fiscal revenue and expenditure system, that is, under the unified leadership and centralized management of the Central People's Government, the principle of assigning responsibilities according to local conditions is implemented, and the finances of the central government, the Greater Administrative Areas, and the provinces (municipalities) are managed at three levels. There is no doubt that this is a new development in our national financial work. This decision is not only beneficial to the consolidation of the central finance but will also greatly encourage local governments in their financial work and, therefore, also in local construction.
    According to the provisions of this decision, in terms of revenue, agricultural tax, customs duties, salt tax, public bonds, foreign debts, and the profits of state-owned enterprises directly managed by the central government, as well as administrative and judicial fees at the central level, are all treated as central government revenue. Commodity tax, industrial and commercial tax, stamp tax, transaction tax, deposit interest income tax, and profits from tobacco and alcohol monopoly, etc., are subject to a proportional sharing between the central and local governments. Slaughter tax, deed tax, real estate tax, special consumption behavior tax, license plate tax, income of state-owned enterprises operated below the Greater Administrative Area level, local administrative and judicial fees, and other income are all treated as income of the Greater Administrative Areas or provinces (municipalities). If the agricultural tax levied according to the rate exceeds the planned quota, 50 percent of the excess may be retained by the local authorities. In terms of expenditure, except for national defense expenditure, diplomatic expenses, repayment of principal and interest on public bonds and foreign debts, and administrative expenses at the central level, which are all included in the central budget, the remainder will be divided between the central and local governments according to the management situation in 1950.
    Obviously, this decision fully complies with the principles stipulated in Article 16 of the Common Program, which states that it should "benefit both national unity and adaptation to local conditions," and Article 40, which states that it should "divide the financial scope of the central and local authorities." The spirit of "adapting to local conditions" is an important feature of this decision.
    Why did the Government Administration Council need and was able to adopt the financial revenue and expenditure policy of assigning responsibilities at each level under unified leadership this year? Why was this policy not adopted last year? The decision on unifying national financial and economic work issued by the Government Administration Council on March 3, last year, strongly emphasized unification, requiring all localities to concentrate financial resources in the central government as much as possible, and requiring all localities to sacrifice local flexibility so that the central government could obtain greater flexibility. Does this now seem to indicate that last year's policy had deviations? No. It was entirely correct to resolutely implement the policy of unified management and leadership of financial work last year. Without such a powerful unification like last year, it would not have been possible to overcome the inflation of the past ten years, to overcome the difficulties at that time, and to achieve such a great victory in financial balance and the stability of financial prices. At that time, all local governments fully supported the central government, and people from all walks of life actively contributed, making great contributions to the country. However, after a year, the national financial situation has initially improved, and some local difficulties need to be resolved and can be resolved. If appropriate care is not given, it will cause some losses in local work, which is not in the interests of the people. Moreover, given the size, population, and complexity of China, if everything is to be concentrated in the central government, it will inevitably overburden the central government agencies with administrative affairs, which may relax consideration of the major policies of the country. Under unified leadership, appropriately delegating some powers and responsibilities to local authorities to enable them to adapt to local conditions is not only harmless but, on the contrary, will consolidate the leadership of the central government due to the enthusiasm of local authorities. Therefore, with the foundation of financial unification already in place and experience gained, it is timely to implement a financial system of assigning responsibilities at each level starting this year.
    Does that mean that the national finances are no longer difficult today, and therefore the scale of local finances has been relaxed? No. Today's national finances have made great progress compared with the year before last, but they are still very difficult. First of all, due to the US imperialists' aggression against our Taiwan and the threat to our national security caused by the aggression against Korea, we cannot but step up national defense construction, which is a very heavy financial burden. Moreover, we still need to strive for continued stability of financial prices under the threat of US imperialism, which requires great financial strength. And the funds for economic construction and administrative expenses are still very difficult. The financial system of assigning responsibilities at each level is only to give appropriate consideration to local needs in the midst of national financial difficulties. However, it should be pointed out that all our difficulties are difficulties in progress and victory, which can be completely overcome, and the financial system of assigning responsibilities at each level is one of the methods to overcome these difficulties.
    Due to the different local economic conditions and the varying amounts of income, will the implementation of this decision of the Government Administration Council cause a serious phenomenon of uneven distribution of benefits and hardships in various localities? No, it won't. Although there are differences in the wealth of local revenues, and there will certainly be differences in the organization of local undertakings, the staffing and supply standards in various localities and the national economic construction investment are uniformly stipulated by the central government, which has taken into account the specific conditions of various localities, and this will not create a situation of widely differing benefits and hardships.
    Of course, there are also people who worry that after the central government emphasizes adapting to local conditions, will it cause local governments to act freely in finances, and even fail to guarantee the central government's revenue? This is completely impossible. According to the facts since the establishment of the Central People's Government more than a year ago, all local governments take care of the overall situation, and they can complete the financial tasks assigned to them by the central government 100% according to the policy, so this worry is superfluous. The decision also stipulates that "People's Governments at all levels must abide by the regulations for all kinds of income, guarantee the completion of tasks, and collect taxes according to law, and shall not arbitrarily increase or decrease them. Without the approval of the central government, no tax items shall be increased casually." "All expenditures of People's Governments at all levels must be implemented in accordance with the budget provisions and shall not be changed without authorization." This is the most effective guarantee. In fact, the People's Governments at all levels have always been loyal to the decisions of the Central People's Government, and they will certainly satisfy the people of the whole country in ensuring the completion of the central financial tasks.
    We can predict that after the implementation of this decision of the Government Administration Council, the finances of the central and local governments will have better results.

### （一）统一领导、分级负责是财政工作的正确方针

　　（一）统一领导、分级负责是财政工作的正确方针
    政务院于三月二十九日公布了一九五一年度财政收支系统划分的决定。这个决定对于国家财政收支系统，采取了统一领导、分级负责的方针，就是在中央人民政府统一领导与集中管理下，实行因地制宜分工负责的方针，将中央、大行政区和省（市）的财政分为三级来管理。毫无疑问，这是我们国家财政工作的一个新的发展。这个决定，不但有益于中央财政的巩固，而且将大大地鼓励地方政府在财政工作上因而也是在地方建设方面的积极性。
    按照这个决定的规定，在岁入方面，农业税、关税、盐税、公债、外债、以及中央直接经管的国营企业利润、中央级行政司法规费，全部作为中央收入。货物税、工商业税、印花税、交易税、存款利息所得税、烟酒专卖利润等，采取中央和地方比例留成的办法。屠宰税、契税、房地产税、特种消费行为税、使用牌照税、大行政区以下经营的国营企业收入、地方行政司法规费及其他收入，均作为大行政区或省（市）的收入。依率计征的农业税超过计划规定者，其超过部分得留百分之五十给地方。在岁出方面，除国防费、外交费、公债外债还本付息、中央级行政经费等全部列入中央预算，其余则暂依一九五○年度管理情况划分，分别由中央和地方支出。
    很显然，这个决定，完全符合共同纲领第十六条所规定的“既利于国家统一，又利于因地制宜”和第四十条所规定的“划分中央和地方的财政范围”的原则。而“因地制宜”的精神，则是这个决定的重要的特点。
    为什么政务院在今年需要而且可能采取在统一领导之下的分级负责的财政收支方针呢？为什么在去年不采取这个方针呢？去年三月三日政务院发布的关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定，曾经十分强调统一，要求各地尽可能把财政力量集中于中央，要求各地牺牲地方的机动，以便中央取得大机动。是不是现在看来去年的方针有偏差呢？不是的。去年坚决实行统一财政工作的管理和领导的方针，是完全正确的。没有去年那样雷霆万钧式的统一，就不可能克服十数年来的通货膨胀，就不可能度过当时难关，取得财政的平衡与金融物价的稳定这样伟大的胜利。当时各地方政府全力支持中央，各界人民踊跃输将，曾经对于国家作了伟大的贡献。但经过一年之后，国家财政状况已有初步好转，地方上的若干困难，需要解决而且也可能解决，如果不适当给予照顾，将造成地方工作上的若干损失，这是对人民不利的。而且，以中国之大，人口之多，情况之复杂，而欲事事集中于中央，必使中央机关行政事务负担过重，对于国家大政方针反有放松考虑的危险。在统一领导之下，适当地把若干权责划归地方，使之因地制宜，则不但无害，反而由于地方积极性的发挥，使中央的领导，更加巩固。因此，在财政统一已有基础工作已有经验的情况下，从今年起，实行分级负责的财政制度，是切合时宜的。
    那吗，是不是今天国家财政已经不困难了，因而对地方财政的尺度放宽了呢？不是的。今天的国家财政和前年比较是有了很大进步的，但仍然是很困难的。首先，由于美帝国主义对于我们台湾的侵略，以及因侵略朝鲜而起的对我们国家安全的威胁，使我们不能不加紧国防建设，这是很重的财政负担。不仅如此，我们还要在美帝国主义威胁下争取金融物价继续稳定，是需要很大的财政力量的。而经济建设的经费及行政费仍然是很困难的。分级负责的财政制度，是在国家财政困难中，对地方需要加以适当照顾而已。但应指明，我们所有的困难，都是前进和胜利中的困难，是完全能够克服的，分级负责的财政制度也是克服困难的方法之一。
    由于地方经济情况不同，收入多寡不一，是不是在实行政务院这个决定之后，会造成地方上苦乐不均的严重现象呢？不会的。地方收入各地虽然有肥瘦之不同，地方事业之举办，当然也会有多少之区别，但各地的编制供给标准和国家经济建设投资，却是中央统一规定的，已经照顾到各地的具体情况，这就不会造成苦乐悬殊的局面。
    当然，也还有人顾虑，中央强调了因地制宜之后，是不是会造成地方政府在财政上自由行动，甚至不能保证中央岁入的现象呢？这是完全不会的。根据中央人民政府成立一年多以来的事实证明，所有地方政府都是照顾大局的，他们对中央所分配给他们的财政任务，都能按照政策百分之百地完成，所以这个顾虑是多余的。在决定中又规定了“各级人民政府对于各项收入，均须按照规定。保证任务完成。并须依法征收，不得任意增减。未经中央核准，不得随便增加税目。”“各级人民政府的一切支出，均须依照预算规定执行，不得自行变更。”这是最有效的保证。事实上，各级地方人民政府从来就是忠实于中央人民政府的决定的，在保证中央财政任务完成这一方面，是一定能令全国人民满意的。
    我们可以预料，实行政务院这一决定之后，中央和地方的财政，都将有更好的成绩。
