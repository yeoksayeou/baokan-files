　　Chen Gengshen and Train Propaganda
　　Guan Sheng

　　Chen Gengshen, a train attendant from the Datong Train Section of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, is the creator of train propaganda. Therefore, at the end of last year, he was awarded the title of Second-Class Labor Hero of the Tianjin Railway Administration; this year, he was selected as a representative to attend the Chahar Province Industrial Labor Model Conference.

　　When Chen Gengshen was a train attendant, he was very responsible, always keeping the train clean and tidy, and he could automatically take care of the elderly and children among the passengers, and explain railway regulations to the passengers. After Chen Gengshen was approved to join the Party, he became even more active in his work.

　　Soon, Chen Gengshen discovered that passengers were violating railway regulations every day on the train, such as carrying overweight baggage, boarding without a ticket, etc.; sometimes, accidents and even casualties occurred due to passengers' carelessness. At this time, the higher authorities called for the elimination of casualties and the development of production competitions. Chen Gengshen thought about how to respond to the call of the higher authorities and do a good job as a train attendant. After thinking for a long time, he finally came up with the idea of first publicizing railway regulations to passengers, so that after they understood them, they would consciously abide by the rules and pay attention to preventing accidents.

　　Chen Gengshen proposed train propaganda to all train personnel, but he encountered some difficulties at the beginning. First of all, the train conductor couldn't put down his "airs" and was unwilling to publicize; most train attendants also believed that "propaganda work is an extra burden" and "many passengers have low levels of education, and propaganda is ineffective." Some even said, "This is begging!" "It's disgraceful!" But these erroneous perceptions not only did not affect Chen Gengshen's propaganda work, but instead made him determined to do his propaganda work well. Comrade Chen Gengshen understood: this is serving the masses, and the masses will definitely be satisfied.

　　This work presented many difficulties for Chen Gengshen, who had only attended elementary school for three or four years. But Chen Gengshen overcame these difficulties. He seized all the time to study. In the first few propaganda efforts, he was covered in sweat, and passengers still raised many opinions. Old Chen was not discouraged. According to the passengers' opinions, he actively thought about how to improve the propaganda work. When the train arrived in Beijing, Chen Gengshen took advantage of his spare time to go to Tianqiao to learn to sing Dagu and Henan Zhui Zi from the performing arts circles. After Old Chen learned it, he was warmly welcomed by the passengers in the propaganda and was asked to "do another section." In this way, Chen Gengshen sang one section after another, telling the passengers about major national events, the policies of the Party and the People's Government, and common sense of riding the train, one by one. The passengers were very satisfied.

　　Under Chen Gengshen's initiation and promotion, train attendants on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway who were able to do propaganda work actively participated in the propaganda work. There are now more than seventy train propagandists. From June of last year to now, these train propagandists have carried out propaganda on current affairs, policies, and basic common sense of riding the train to 500,000 passengers. This propaganda can adopt different propaganda forms and content according to different periods of political tasks and different locations. A long time ago, the focus of propaganda was on basic knowledge for passengers riding the train; after the outbreak of the Korean War, the focus was on resisting U.S. aggression, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending the country. Most of the passengers on the eastern section of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway are merchants and farmers from Hebei, who like to listen to Xihe Dagu and Henan Zhui Zi; train propagandists use this form for propaganda; most of the passengers on the western section are Shanxi people, so train attendants with Shanxi accents come to do the propaganda, so the propaganda effect is naturally great. When publicizing the peace signature campaign, an old man in his seventies listened to the peace signature propaganda and stood up to call on everyone, saying, "Everyone, come and sign quickly. One more person signs, one more point of strength." In July and August of last year alone, after the train attendants' propaganda, 20,000 people signed their names. When publicizing opposition to the atrocities of U.S. imperialism, a veteran said, "I heard that U.S. imperialism is so brutal; and I see you workers carrying out current affairs propaganda so enthusiastically. After I recover from my injuries, I will definitely ask to join the Chinese People's Volunteers and go to the Korean front to eliminate the American beasts!" The train attendants of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway have constantly received letters from passengers praising them, which is their glory in serving the people.

### 陈庚申和列车宣传

　　陈庚申和列车宣传
    关声
    京绥铁路大同车段的列车员陈庚申，是列车宣传的创造者。因此，在去年年底，他被评为天津铁路管理局的二等功臣；今年又被评为出席察哈尔省工业劳动模范会议的代表。
    陈庚申当列车员时非常负责，总是把列车收拾得干干净净的，并能自动照顾旅客中的老人和小孩，和给旅客讲解铁路规章。陈庚申被批准入党后，对工作更加积极。
    不久，陈庚申发现列车上天天都有旅客违反乘车规章的事情发生，如携带行李超过分量，没有剪票便上了车等等；有时因乘客不小心，甚至发生了伤亡事故。这时，上级号召消灭伤亡事故，开展生产竞赛。陈庚申就想怎样响应上级号召，把列车员工作作好。他考虑了很久，终于想出了先给旅客宣传铁路规章，使旅客了解以后，自觉地遵守乘车规章和注意防止事故的办法。
    陈庚申向全列车人员提出了列车宣传工作，但是开始就遇到了一些困难。首先是列车长放不下“架子”不愿意宣传；一般列车员也认为：“宣传工作是额外负担”、“旅客中文化低的很多，宣传也不起作用”。甚至有人这样说：“这是讨乞的勾当！”“散德行！”但是这些错误的认识，不但没有影响陈庚申的宣传工作，反使他下决心要把自己的宣传工作作好。陈庚申同志懂得：这是为群众服务，这是群众一定满意的事。
    这个工作，对于只上过三、四年小学的陈庚申，是有很多困难的。但是陈庚申克服了这些困难。他抓紧一切时间进行学习。在起初几次宣传中，他累得满头大汗，旅客还提出了好多意见。老陈并不灰心，按照旅客的意见，积极想法改进宣传工作。当列车到北京时，陈庚申就乘着工余时间，到天桥向曲艺界学习演唱大鼓和河南坠子。老陈学会以后，在宣传中，就受到了旅客热烈的欢迎，并要求“再来一段”。这样陈庚申唱了一段又一段，把国家大事，党与人民政府的政策及乘车常识，通过这些宣传形式，一件一件地告诉了旅客。旅客非常满意。
    在陈庚申的发起与带动下，京绥铁路能够作宣传工作的列车员都踊跃地参加了宣传工作，现已有七十多名列车宣传员。从去年六月到现在，这些列车宣传员已向五十万旅客进行了时事、政策、乘车基本常识的宣传。这些宣传并能根据不同时期的政治任务和不同地点，采用不同的宣传形式与内容。很早以前，以旅客乘车基本知识为宣传中心；在朝鲜战争爆发以后，即以抗美援朝保家卫国为宣传中心。京绥东段的旅客以商人和河北农民为多，他们喜欢听西河大鼓、河南坠子；列车宣传员就多用这种形式进行宣传；西段乘客多是山西人，就由山西口音的列车员来宣传，这样宣传效果当然很大。在宣传和平签名运动时，一个七十多岁的老头听了和平签名宣传后，就起来号召大家说：“大家快来签名吧，多一个人签名，多一分力量。”仅去年七、八两个月，经过列车员宣传后，签名的就有两万人。当宣传反对美帝国主义暴行时，一个荣誉军人说：“我听到美国帝国主义这样残暴；又看见你们工人同志这样热烈进行时事宣传，我养好了伤一定要求参加中国人民志愿军，到朝鲜前线去，消灭美国野兽！”京绥铁路的列车员曾不断地接到旅客表扬他们的来信，这正是他们为人民服务的光荣。
