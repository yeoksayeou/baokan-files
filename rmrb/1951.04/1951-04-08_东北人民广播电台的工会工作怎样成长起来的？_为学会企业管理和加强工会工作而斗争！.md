How Did the Trade Union Work of the Northeast People's Broadcasting Station Grow?
	Strive to Learn Business Management and Strengthen Trade Union Work!

    In news and publishing units, is it possible to organize industrial trade unions? If trade unions are organized, can they play a role? Many people have doubts about this issue in fact. Their main reason is that in news and publishing units, trade unions cannot play a role in work. Therefore, the main significance of organizing a trade union is lost. However, the initial experience of the Northeast People's Broadcasting Station's trade union has already answered this question.
    The grassroots committee of the Northeast (Shenyang) People's Broadcasting Station's trade union was established on December 18, 1949. For nearly half a year, its work was passive. Trade union cadres were not well-established, and their ideas were not clear about what the trade union should do. Some even thought that having a trade union in the organization was superfluous. Only 52 members were in the engineering departments, all technicians and workers. No one from the administrative and editorial departments participated. Trade union work was limited to the repair department, factory, and other units of the engineering departments. A competition was once launched, but it subsided due to construction tasks.
    Since the transfer of the radio station's trade union to the news, publishing, and printing industry trade union system in July 1950, the trade union organization has expanded to the administrative and editorial departments. With the Northeast's entire people’s movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and the development of the radio station's broadcasting business, the enthusiasm of all comrades throughout the station soared unprecedentedly. The comrades in the general editor's office, in the spirit of caring about work, began to brew a competition to improve the quality of work. From November to December, with the support of the Party and the administration, and the cooperation of the Youth League, the trade union led this mass patriotic work competition and expanded it to all departments of the station. The central slogans of the competition were "Improve leadership, improve work, strengthen unity, and strengthen learning." From then on, the radio station's trade union clarified the correct direction of focusing on work, which made the radio station's work completely new.
    As soon as the competition became a craze, it showed concern for leadership and work. Many comrades actively put forward opinions and criticisms. Many opinions were also put forward to the trade union, requesting solutions. The Party and the administration attached great importance to this, using individual talks, holding various meetings, or researching solutions with the trade union. Thus, with the promotion and help of the trade union, the leadership improved the untimely and procrastinating work style of planning, strengthened the relationship between superiors and subordinates, and inspired the enthusiasm and creativity of the comrades. For example, in order to realize the leadership's intention of "reporting should be swift and timely," the editing team used tape recorders to record the celebration on the streets, factories, and schools when celebrating the liberation of Pyongyang, and edited and broadcast it that night. This was more vivid and faster than the past dull formulas of interviewing, editing, and broadcasting. In order to cooperate with the Northeast Patriotic Production Competition Movement, the broadcasting station organized factories to challenge each other through broadcasting, which was faster, more timely, and more influential than writing challenge letters. In January, learning from the experience of other radio stations, it frequently organized broadcasting conferences, which were well received by all sectors. The social education team of the station completed the arduous task of electing model listeners from 100,000 listeners a week ahead of schedule, and won the red flag for outstanding work. The comrades of the broadcasting team often had disagreements without principle. During the competition, they also automatically held a "heart-to-heart talk." Everyone said what was on their minds and used the weapon of self-criticism to overcome the long-standing disunity, and won the unity red flag. The engineering department, in the heavy construction task, put forward the condition of ensuring the completion of the task without damaging or losing equipment. In mid-December, they successfully completed various tasks, and more than 40 outstanding workers emerged. Recently, under the organization of the administration and the trade union, a major security inspection was carried out, which reduced machine accidents. Because the trade union focused on work and launched and led this work competition, the prestige of the trade union has been increasing, opening up a broad road for grassroots organizations of news, publishing, and printing trade unions.
    What was the situation of the broadcasting station before the patriotic work competition was launched? The quality of editing work was not high, broadcasts often made mistakes, programs were often changed, and accidents often occurred. The most serious thing was that last year, two stations invited Comrade Zhao Guoyou, a national model worker representative, to speak at the same time. Because the connection was not good, after Zhao Guoyou finished speaking at the Shenyang station, he returned to the factory. The program that the Northeast station had announced to the masses fell through, causing a great political loss. Some groups in the editing room had disagreements without principle, which affected work. The administration did not take good care of the welfare of the staff, and the food was expensive and not good. The dormitories were crowded, which also affected the morale of the staff. At the beginning of the competition, there was a lot of ideological obstacles among intellectual workers. Some editors and administrative staff thought that "the factory can compete, but it doesn't matter if the radio station competes or not, it will still complete the task. It doesn't make much sense." Some people even thought that "the competition should not be proposed by the editing team first, there are no specific conditions." All kinds of strange arguments were heard from time to time. After the entire station studied the current affairs of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and defending the country, it stimulated a high degree of patriotism. Especially after the "Zhao Guoyou broadcast fell through" accident, the comrades of the editing team made profound self-criticisms, put forward the slogan of ensuring the elimination of errors, and formulated work plans for groups and individuals to challenge the entire station. The trade union grasped the mood of the staff and, together with the Party, government, and Youth League, organized the competition and evaluation committees, and proposed to carry out a universal patriotic work competition throughout the station with work, study, and unity as the content. As a result of the competition, the broadcasting station showed a brand new look. Now, this competition has shifted from a climax to a regular and in-depth stage.
    From the development process of the trade union of the Northeast People's Broadcasting Station in Shenyang, the following experiences can be obtained:
    1. It is possible and necessary to establish trade unions in news and publishing units. Only by obtaining the strong cooperation of this broad mass organization can the administrative leadership comprehensively and timely improve and promote work. Trade unions are not a burden on the administrative leadership. The welfare demands of the staff should not be regarded as an extra burden, but are closely related to the work and life of the organization. As long as the trade union work is valued and supported, the trade union can become a powerful assistant to the administrative leadership.
    2. In general production departments, trade unions must focus on production; in news and publishing units, trade unions must also focus on the work of their own units, because this is their own production. The trade union of the Northeast People's Broadcasting Station achieved results and improved its prestige in the mass movement of leading the patriotic work competition, thereby enabling the trade union organization to develop and consolidate.
    3. The close combination of the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League is a key factor in determining the quality of trade union work: the administrative leadership of the Northeast Station strongly supports the trade union. The administration formulates clear work plans on time, finds ways to solve the difficulties of the staff, and hands over the "New Atmosphere" newspaper sponsored by the administration to the trade union for publication. The Party and the Youth League often call on Party members and Youth League members to actively participate in trade union work. Trade union cadres also take the initiative to establish close contact with the Party, government, and Youth League, and discuss and solve everything together. This consistent pace and concentration of forces are the determining factors for doing a good job in the competition.
    4. Trade union work, especially the competition movement, must strengthen publicity and mobilization. The trade union of the Northeast People's Broadcasting Station attached importance to this work, took over the semi-monthly "New Atmosphere," established blackboard newspapers in each office, invited Party reporters to regularly make current affairs reports, organized collective viewing of educational films and dramas, and timely combined with the current work and ideological situation to conduct casual talks, which inspired the enthusiasm of the staff and enlightened the staff's awareness, so that the movement was in-depth and universal; timely summary, rewards, and criticism are important methods for consolidating and developing the movement.
    5. Trade union cadres must serve enthusiastically and work with peace of mind. Trade union cadres of the radio station are all part-time. In addition to their heavy administrative work, they also have to bear the trade union work, but they are all active and responsible and serve patiently. The trade union meeting system of the broadcasting station is relatively sound, and problems can be solved at each standing committee meeting. As the chairman of the station's trade union said: "We are studying how to do the work, and if it doesn't work, we will discuss it again, and we must seek a solution."
    In short, the trade union work of the Northeast People's Broadcasting Station proves that not only can trade unions be organized in news units, but also competitions can be organized. The key lies in the attention and help of the Party and the government. The leading comrades of the Northeast (Shenyang) Station are all trade union members, which gives strong support to the trade union work.
    Existing problems
    1. A certain material reward system is an important guarantee for consolidating the morale of the staff and continuing to carry out the competition movement. However, the trade union of the broadcasting station still lacks material reward methods, and this aspect still needs to be improved.
    2. The welfare work still cannot meet the requirements of the staff. Intellectual workers of the radio station are the majority. After work, they urgently need appropriate mental adjustment. Organizing various cultural and entertainment activities has become an urgent requirement of the staff. The station is working hard to solve this aspect.

　　东北人民广播电台的工会工作怎样成长起来的？
　  为学会企业管理和加强工会工作而斗争！
　　张正路
    在新闻和出版的单位里，能否组织产业工会？组织了工会是否能起作用？有不少人对于这个问题在事实上是怀疑的。他们主要的理由是：在新闻和出版单位里，工会不可能在工作方面发挥作用。因此，就失去了组织工会的主要意义。但是东北人民广播电台工会的初步经验，已经回答了这个问题。
    东北（沈阳）人民广播电台工会基层委员会于一九四九年十二月十八日成立后，在将近半年的期间，工作处于被动状态。工会干部不健全，思想也不明确工会应做什么，甚至认为机关中有工会是多余的。会员只在工务部门中有五十二名，全是技术员和工人。行政及编辑部门无人参加。工会工作也只限于工务部门的修理部、工厂等单位。也曾一度展开竞赛，后因有修建任务，又趋沉寂。
    自一九五○年七月电台工会转入新闻出版印刷业产业工会系统之后，工会组织即扩大到行政及编辑部门。随着全东北抗美援朝爱国主义生产竞赛运动以及电台广播业务的开展，全台同志情绪空前高涨。总编室各组同志在关心工作的精神上，酝酿起来提高工作质量的竞赛。从十一月到十二月，在党和行政的支持、团的配合之下，工会领导起来这一群众性的爱国主义工作竞赛，并且开展到全台各个部门。竞赛的中心口号是“改进领导，提高工作，加强团结，加强学习”。从此电台工会明确了面向工作的正确方针使电台工作焕然一新。
    竞赛初成热潮，就表现了关心领导关心工作，很多同志积极提出意见与批评。好多意见也向工会提出，要求解决。党和行政十分重视，用个别谈话、召开各种会议、或与工会研究解决办法，于是领导方面，在工会的推动与帮助下，改进了计划不及时与拖拉作风，密切了上下级关系，启发了同志们的积极性和创造性。例如编辑组为实现“报道应迅速及时”的领导意图，在庆祝平壤解放时，即利用录音机到街头、工厂、学校，将欢庆实况收录下来，当晚加以编辑播送，这样比过去经过采访、编辑播讲的呆板公式更生动迅速了。为配合东北爱国主义生产竞赛运动，广播电台组织各厂利用广播互相挑战，较写挑战书，更迅速、及时、影响大。一月间，学习了其他电台的经验，经常组织广播大会，都得到各界好评。该台社会教育组提前一星期完成了从十万听户中选举模范收音员的艰巨任务，获工作优胜红旗。播音组同志间好闹无原则意见，竞赛中也自动召开了“谈心会”，每个人说出了心里话，运用了自我批评的斗争武器，克服了历来不团结的局面，获团结红旗。工务部门在繁重的修建任务中，提出了保证完成任务，不损坏不丢失器材为应战条件，十二月中旬顺利的完成各项任务，涌现四十余名优秀工作者。最近在行政与工会组织下，又进行了保安大检查，减少了机器事故。由于工会面向工作，发动并领导了这次工作竞赛，工会威信已蒸蒸日上，开辟了新闻出版印刷工会基层组织的广阔的道路。
    在未发动爱国主义工作竞赛以前，广播电台的情况是怎样的呢？编辑工作质量不高，播音经常出错，节目常有更动，也常发生事故。最严重的是在去年有一次两台同时请全国劳动模范代表赵国有同志讲话，因联系不好，在沈阳台讲完，赵国有同志就回厂了。东北台向群众预告了的节目落了空，造成政治上很大的损失。编辑室有些小组闹无原则纠纷，影响工作。行政对职工福利照顾不周，伙食贵而不好。宿舍拥挤，也影响职工情绪。竞赛开始时，在脑力劳动者中思想障碍很大，一部分编辑行政人员认为“工厂竞赛可以，广播电台竞赛不竞赛也一样完成任务，没多大意思。”有的人还认为“竞赛不应是编辑组首先提出来，没有具体条件。”各种各样的怪论，时有所闻。全台经过了抗美援朝、保家卫国的时事学习，激发了高度的爱国热情，尤其在“赵国有播讲落空”事故发生后，编辑组同志都做了深刻检讨，提出保证消灭差错的口号，并制订了小组、个人的工作计划向全台挑战。工会就掌握职工情绪，会同党、政、团组织了竞赛、评审两委员会，提出以工作、学习、团结为内容，在全台普遍展开了爱国主义工作竞赛。竞赛结果，使广播电台出现了崭新的面貌。现在，这一竞赛已从高潮转入经常的深入的阶段。
    从沈阳东北人民广播电台工会的发展经过中，可以得到如下几个经验：
    一、新闻出版单位中可能也必须成立工会，行政领导只有取得了这一广大群众性组织的有力配合，才能全面的及时的改进与推动工作。工会不是行政领导的累赘，不能把职工的福利要求认为额外负担，而是和机关工作、机关生活密切结合着的，只要重视和支持工会工作，工会即可成为行政领导的有力助手。
    二、在一般生产部门中，工会必须面向生产；在新闻出版单位中，工会同样必须面向本单位的工作，因为这就是自己的生产。东北人民广播电台的工会，是在领导爱国主义工作竞赛的群众运动中获得了成绩，提高了威信，从而使工会组织得到了发展和巩固的。
    三、党政工团的密切结合是决定工会工作好坏的一个重要关键：东北台行政领导对工会是大力支持的。行政按时制订明确工作计划，想办法解决职工困难，并把行政主办的《新气象报》交工会出版，党、团经常号召党、团员积极参加工会工作。工会干部也主动和党、政、团取得密切联系，凡事共同商量解决。这种步调一致，集中力量是搞好竞赛工作的决定因素。
    四、工会工作，尤其是竞赛运动，必须加强宣传鼓动工作，东北人民广播电台的工会正是重视了这一工作，接办了旬刊《新气象》，建立了各室的黑板报，请党的报告员经常做时事报告，组织集体看有教育意义的电影、戏剧，及时地结合着当前的工作与思想情况进行漫谈，激励了职工的热情，启发了职工的觉悟，才使得运动深入和普遍；及时的总结奖励和批评，又是使运动巩固和发展的重要方法。
    五、工会干部必须热忱服务，安心工作。电台工会干部都是兼职，除个人繁重的行政工作外，还要担负工会工作，但他们均积极负责，耐心服务。广播电台工会会议制度比较健全，每次常务委员会上都能解决问题。正如该台工会主席说的：“我们是研究着做工作，行不通再讨论，一定要求得解决。”
    总之，由东北人民广播电台的工会工作，证明了新闻单位里不仅可以搞工会，而且也可以搞竞赛。其关键就在于党、政的重视和帮助。东北（沈阳）台的领导同志全是工会会员，这就给了工会工作以有力的支持。
    现存问题
    一、一定的物质奖励制度是巩固职工情绪，继续开展竞赛运动的重要保证。但广播电台工会还缺乏物质奖励办法，这一方面还须设法改进。
    二、福利工作还不能满足职工要求，电台脑力劳动者居多数，工作之余，极需精神上的适当调剂，组织各种文化娱乐活动就成为职工的迫切要求了。这一方面的工作，该台正在努力解决。
