Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

Comrade Editor:
　　The People's Daily published Comrade Li Qingtian's criticism of the mold and rot of public grain in Dongxiang, Xiangyin County, on March 13th. Our failure to reply sooner was wrong. We are now reporting the inspection situation to you.
    (1) Our county's autumn grain collection work last year was very rushed. The grain collection took place during the rainy season, and the new grain was generally quite damp. Most of the public grain in Dongxiang was stored in borrowed ancestral halls and landlords' houses. Due to the small capacity of the warehouses and improper storage methods, insect infestation and heating occurred. Last November, the warehouses reported this situation to the county's leading organs. The County Grain Bureau immediately sent personnel to inspect various districts and found that the county had 4.06 million catties of damp grain, 5.4 million catties of heating grain, and 2.45 million catties of insect-infested grain (this figure is based on the total grain stored in the warehouses where problems occurred; in reality, only the top two or three inches of the stored grain were infested or heated). We studied this serious phenomenon and dispatched a large number of cadres to assist the warehouses in turning, inverting, ventilating, and sifting the grain for rescue work. At the same time, we requested assistance from our special district and the Hunan Provincial Grain Bureau to purchase a large number of insecticides. After more than twenty days of rescue work, the heating and insect infestation have basically stopped.
    (2) The report in your newspaper that moldy grain was found in Heshui and the other four warehouses, and that the grain in the Changjia Dawu (residence) had rotted into five or six-inch thick slabs, is not as serious as the actual situation, according to our inspection.
    (3) We accept the readers' criticism of our work in order to improve our future work. The mold and rot of public grain is the result of insufficient attention from our leading organs and failure to promptly grasp the inspection work. Warehouse cadres' lack of a strong sense of responsibility should also be criticized. We will definitely establish a regular inspection and reporting system in the future, and strengthen the education of warehouse cadres to ensure that the mold, rot, and insect infestation of public grain do not occur again.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　湘阴县建立检查制度加强公粮保管编辑同志：
    人民日报三月十三日登载了李青田同志对湘阴县东乡公粮霉烂的批评。我们未能早日答复，这是不对的。今将检查情况报告给你们。
    （一）我县去年秋征工作十分匆促，征粮时正值雨季，一般新谷都较潮湿。东乡公粮大多数是借用祠堂和利用地主大屋储存，由于仓房容量太小，储存又不得法，以致发生生虫发热现象。去年十一月间，各仓库即将这个情况报告给县的领导机关，县粮食局当即派员到各区检查，发现全县有潮湿粮四○六万斤，发热粮五四○万斤，生虫粮二四五万斤（这个数字是根据发生问题的仓库全部存粮计算的，实际上生虫发热的仅是存粮上面二、三寸厚的一层）。我们研究了这种严重现象，已派出大批干部，协助各库进行翻仓、倒仓、通风、过筛等抢救工作。同时请本专区及湖南省粮食局协助购得大批杀虫药剂。经过二十多天的抢救工作，发热与生虫现象目前已基本上停止。
    （二）贵报所载河市等四个仓库均发现霉谷及场家大屋谷子霉烂成为五、六寸厚板等，经我们检查，实际情况，并非如此严重。
    （三）我们接受读者对我们的批评，以改进我们今后的工作。公粮的霉烂是我们领导机关工作不够深入，未能及时抓紧检查工作的结果。仓库干部责任心不强，也应当受到批评。我们今后一定建立定期的检查汇报制度，并加强对仓库干部的教育，保证不再发生霉烂、虫蚀公粮的事情。
              湖南省湘阴县县长  史杰
        粮食局局长  樊川廷
