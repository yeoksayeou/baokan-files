    In Certain Areas of Songjiang Province, the Phenomenon of Forest Destruction Should Be Eliminated

    To the Editor:

    Forest protection work in Songjiang Province is very poor. In counties such as Huanan, Dongning, Fuyuan, Tonghe, Linkou, Hailin, Hulin, and Ning'an, the phenomena of indiscriminate logging, illegal felling, and burning of state-owned forests are extremely serious. For example, Huanan County, without authorization, approved (which agency, who approved it, should be specified - Editor) the masses of Fuxing Village and Qingfeng Village in the county to cross the border into Qingbeiling in Huachuan County to steal and fell more than 5,000 trees. Guan Renxiang, the district head of Sanchahe District in Dongning County, without asking for instructions from his superiors, mobilized the masses to enter the mountains to cut 308 electric poles; he also failed to screen the people entering the mountains, which led to the infiltration of illegal landlords and special agents, and caused a mountain fire, burning more than 4,000 hectares of forest and wilderness, and losing 1,600 cubic meters of timber. In Tonghe County, the masses in Fengshan District cut more than 600 cubic meters of red and white pine logs in the Southwest Fork and Daobanling Forest Farms in the district, of which 509.47 cubic meters were newly cut trees. The Beiyinhe Public Security Outpost of the Changchun Railway in Lalin County cut down 4,800 bundles of willow branches (each bundle selling for 3,000 Northeast currency) on both sides of the river embankment and along the Mangniu River Bridge for side-line production. These illegal felling operations were completely substandard. The average height of the stumps was more than 40 to 50 centimeters, and some were as high as one meter. The tree tops were scattered all over the mountains.

    In the forest areas of 14 counties and cities in Songjiang Province, such as Shangzhi, Hailin, and Muling, 34 fires occurred continuously within 15 days from March 24th to April 7th. In Hailin County, more than 600 hectares of young forest were burned, resulting in the loss of millions of young trees, and the burned wilderness area reached more than 5,000 hectares. A fire in Tangyuan County spread over 100 li. A unit of the People's Liberation Army caused a mountain fire by burning land for reclamation in Yilan, which burned from April 3rd to April 10th. When the mountain fire first broke out, the relevant departments of the Provincial People's Government sent letters to them requesting them to provide assistance, but they did not pay attention to it.

    Editor's Note: The situation of indiscriminate logging and burning of forests in the above-mentioned areas of Songjiang Province illustrates a serious problem, namely, many cadres in these forest areas lack sufficient understanding of the forest protection policy. We hope that the relevant authorities will conduct a swift inspection and formulate effective measures to protect forests that are practical and feasible.

### 松江省某些地区  应消除破坏森林的现象

    松江省某些地区
    应消除破坏森林的现象编辑同志：
    松江省护林工作做得很差。桦南、东宁、抚远、通河、林口、海林、虎林、宁安等县滥伐、盗伐及烧毁国有森林的现象极为严重。例如：桦南县擅自批准（什么机关，什么人批准的，应说明——编者）该县福兴村和庆丰村群众越界进入华川县的青背岭，盗伐林木五千余棵。东宁县三岔河区长关任祥，不请示上级，即号召群众入山砍伐电杆子三○八根；对入山群众亦不加以审查，致使不法地主、特务分子混了进去，并引起山火，烧毁森林原野四千余垧，损失林木一、六○○立方米。通河县凤山区群众在该区西南岔和倒搬岭两个林场砍伐红白松原木六百余立方米，其中砍伐的新树占五○九·四七立方米。中长铁路拉林县背阴河公安驻在所，为了搞副业生产，将河堤两岸和忙牛河大桥两旁之护岸柳条砍去四、八○○捆（每捆卖三千元东北币）。这些非法采伐完全不合标准。伐根平均都在四五十公分以上，其中有高达一米者。梢头木扔的满山遍野都是。
    松江省尚志、海林、穆棱等十四个县市的林区，从三月二十四日至四月七日十五天内，连续发生火灾三十四次。海林县烧毁幼林面积六百余垧，损失幼树数百万株，烧火的原野面积达五千余垧。汤原县一次火灾竟蔓延一百多里。人民解放军某部在依兰烧地开荒而引起山火，由四月三日烧至四月十日。当山火刚烧起来的时候，省人民政府有关部门曾去信请他们施救，但他们竟未加重视。
            读者  姚克俭
    编者按：松江省上述地区发生的滥伐和烧毁森林的情况，说明了一个严重的问题，即在这些森林区域，许多干部对于护林政策还缺乏足够的认识。我们希望有关机关迅速进行检查，并订出切实可行的保护森林的有效办法。
