Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th. Over three thousand representatives from all walks of life in Yan'an, including the Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Yan'an Prefectural Commissioner's Office, the County People's Government, the Yan'an Military Subdistrict troops, and people's representatives, held a public memorial meeting today at the Martyrs' Cemetery Square to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the deaths of the "April 8th" Martyrs and Martyr Guan Xiangying. The memorial platform was set up on the right side of the cemetery, with portraits of Martyrs Wang Ruofei, Qin Bangxian, Ye Ting, Deng Fa, and Huang Qisheng hanging high amidst the white banners. The memorial ceremony began with mournful music, and everyone observed three minutes of silence for the "April 8th" Martyrs and the martyrs and people who sacrificed in the revolutionary war. Hei Zhide, Secretary of the Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the chief celebrant, spoke, pointing out that the martyrdom of the "April 8th" Martyrs was caused by the US imperialism instructing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to deliberately undermine peace and launch a civil war. Now, US imperialism is intensifying its war of aggression against Korea and arming Japan. The Chinese people should always remember these unforgivable crimes of US imperialism, resolutely resist US aggression and aid Korea, and avenge the martyrs. Yang Buhao, a nationally renowned agricultural labor model, said in his speech: "US imperialism is the Chinese people's sworn enemy. It gave guns and cannons to Chiang Kai-shek to launch a civil war, once occupied Yan'an, and destroyed our life of abundance. Now it is arming our enemy Japan to use it as its tool of aggression. We are determined to oppose US imperialism to the end, and we vow not to rest until this blood feud is avenged." The chief celebrant then led everyone around the martyrs' tomb. Many people also brought sacrificial offerings to pay their respects and angrily denounced the crimes of the US-Chiang reactionaries.

In addition, all the staff of the Yan'an Newspaper Office went to Qingliang Mountain on Qingming Festival to pay tribute to Yang Song, the former editor-in-chief of the Jiefang Daily.

　  公祭“四八”烈士暨关向应烈士
    【新华社延安八日电】中国共产党延安地委会、延安专署、县人民政府、延安军分区部队及各界人民代表等三千余人今天在烈士陵园广场举行“四八”烈士暨关向应烈士逝世五周年公祭大会。公祭台设于陵墓右侧，素幛丛中高悬王若飞、秦邦宪、叶挺、邓发、黄齐生诸烈士遗像。公祭仪式在哀乐中开始，全体向“四八”烈士及在革命战争中牺牲的烈士和人民静默三分钟。主祭人中国共产党延安地委会书记黑志德讲话，他指出“四八”烈士的殉难是美帝国主义指使蒋介石匪帮蓄意破坏和平、发动内战所造成的。现在美帝国主义正加紧进行侵略朝鲜的战争和武装日本。中国人民应永远记住美帝国主义这些不可饶恕的罪行，坚决抗美援朝，为烈士们报仇。全国著名的农业劳动模范杨步浩在讲话中说：“美帝国主义是中国人民的世仇，他把枪炮给蒋介石发动内战，曾侵占了延安，破坏了我们丰衣足食的生活，现在又武装我们的仇人日本来作他的侵略工具。我们决心反对美帝国主义到底，血仇不报誓不休。”继由主祭人率领全体绕烈士墓一周。许多群众亦纷纷携带祭礼前往祭奠，并愤怒地控诉美蒋反动派的罪行。
    又延安报社全体人员，曾于清明节登清凉山祭奠前解放日报总编辑杨松。
