The Sixteen Soviet Republics That Completed the Post-War Five-Year Plan (Part 1)
　　Li He
　　The imperialists miscalculated on many things, including the assumption that the Soviet Union would be unable to heal the wounds suffered in the Great Patriotic War. However, due to the superiority of the Soviet socialist system, the selfless labor of the Soviet people, and the correct leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet Union has developed even more powerfully after the war than before. The situation of the sixteen Soviet republics that completed the post-war five-year plan is the best proof of this.

　　Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic

　　The Russian Federation possesses a powerful and advanced socialist industry and agriculture. Before the war, it produced approximately three-quarters of the Soviet Union's industrial products. Its wheat cultivated area accounted for three-quarters of the Soviet Union's total, oats for four-fifths, and potato planting area for seven-tenths. The western regions of the Russian Federation suffered savage destruction at the hands of the German fascist bandits during the war. Of the total Soviet Union losses of 679 billion rubles, the Russian Federation accounted for 249 billion rubles, more than one-third.

　　The basic task of the Soviet Union's post-war five-year plan was to restore the war-damaged areas, restore industry and agriculture to pre-war levels, and then surpass those levels. The task of the post-war five-year plan has been successfully completed throughout the Soviet Union, and it has also been successfully completed in the Russian Federation.

　　During the post-war five-year plan period, the total industrial output of the Russian Federation greatly exceeded pre-war levels. Metallurgical factories in the eastern regions are now producing two and a half times the amount of rolled iron as before the war. The coal region near Moscow produces three times the amount of coal as before the war. Coal production in the Urals, Kuzbass, and other eastern coal regions is more than twice wartime production. Many new oil wells and refineries have been built in Bashkir. Huge oil reserves have been discovered in the Tatar Autonomous Republic. Oil extraction is being carried out extensively in Sakhalin. Moscow industry completed its five-year plan in less than four years; in 1950, it produced over 50 percent more products than before the war, and the output of automobiles and ball bearings alone has more than doubled in the last three years. New mines are constantly being established and new railways are being laid in the Urals and Siberia, and in the central and frontier states.

　　Agriculture in the Russian Federation is fully collectivized and highly mechanized. The production of grains, flax, hemp, potatoes, and sunflowers ranks first in the entire Soviet Union. In 1950 alone, the cultivated area of all crops increased by 5.8 million hectares compared to 1949. The workload of machine tractor stations increased by 15 percent compared to 1949. In terms of livestock breeding, cattle increased by 8 percent, pigs by 26 percent, sheep by 11 percent, horses by 10 percent, and poultry by 43 percent. The work of merging collective farms last year has brought new achievements to agriculture.

　　Economic achievements have guaranteed the improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards. In 1950, the goods sold in state-owned and cooperative stores increased by 30 percent compared to 1949. During the five years after the war, the Russian Federation constructed residential buildings with an area of tens of millions of square meters in cities, and restored and newly built more than one million residences in rural areas. As of the end of 1950, the Russian Federation had 20.6 million students in primary, seven-year, secondary, and secondary technical schools. In 1950, 687,000 university students were studying in 502 higher education institutions.

　　Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic

　　Ukraine's total industrial output in 1950 exceeded the pre-war level by 15 percent. Among them, the machinery manufacturing industry developed the fastest, with output in 1950 exceeding the pre-war level by 25 percent. Ukraine's cultivated area has reached pre-war levels, and the harvest of grains and industrial crops, as well as the production of livestock breeding, have all exceeded pre-war levels. In 1950, the workload of tractors increased by 42 percent compared to 1940. In 1950, 82 percent of all cultivated land was cultivated with tractors, and harvesting was mainly carried out with combine harvesters and other harvesting machines. Rural power stations had 50,000 kilowatts more electricity than before the war. Last year, Ukraine's 33,653 collective farms were merged into 19,505 large collective farms. Livestock breeding has also greatly developed, with 1,915,000 more cattle than in 1940.

　　During the five years after the war, residential buildings with an area of 13 million square meters were restored and newly built in cities and worker residential areas. Collective farms built 950,000 residences and over 280,000 other buildings. The number of seven-year and complete secondary schools in the western regions has increased fourfold. Ukraine, with a population of over 40 million, now has 158 higher education institutions with 147,000 students. The Ukrainian Academy of Sciences leads 38 scientific research institutes.

　　Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic

　　Belarusian industry has greatly developed after the war. If the total industrial output in 1945 is taken as 100, then it was 155.4 in 1946, 227.8 in 1947, 328 in 1948, 433.8 in 1949, and 562 in 1950; a five-and-a-half-fold increase in five years. The machinery manufacturing industry has developed particularly rapidly, with output increasing fourfold compared to 1940 and more than tenfold compared to 1945. Agriculture has also exceeded pre-war levels. In 1950, the cultivated land of collective farms exceeded the pre-war level by 16.7 percent. The horsepower of tractors doubled in 1950 alone. In 1950, 9,770 small collective farms in the eastern regions were merged into 3,226 large collective farms. The average cultivated area of each merged large farm is over 1,200 hectares. During the five years after the war, residential buildings with an area of approximately 4 million square meters were built in cities and district centers, and 436,000 collective farmer residences were built in rural areas. After the war, the number of middle schools was 2.2 times the pre-war level, and the number of students in grades 8 to 10 was 3.2 times the pre-war level. The number of students in higher education institutions increased by 7,000 compared to before the war.

　　Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic

　　There are three federated republics in the South Caucasus: Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia.

　　Georgia's industry has developed exceptionally rapidly. In 1950, the republic's industrial output, per capita, increased more than 30 times compared to before the revolution. Total industrial output had already exceeded pre-war levels in 1947, and in 1950 it exceeded pre-war levels by 52 percent. In 1950, power generation capacity reached 326,000 kilowatts, equivalent to 41 times that of 1913. In the capital Tbilisi, more than 5,000 workers completed 6 to 10 years' worth of production quotas during the five-year plan, and 892 people completed 11 to 15 years' worth of production quotas.

　　Georgia is rich in tea, grapes, and wheat. In 1948, tea production was 46,600 tons and grape production was 43,000 tons; but by 1950, the production of tea and grapes had increased to more than 83,000 tons and 71,000 tons, respectively. In 1950, wheat production increased by 63 percent compared to 1940. The newly reclaimed land in 1950 increased by 14 percent compared to 1949. Under Soviet power, Georgia has opened seven canals, irrigating 288,000 hectares of land; five canals are currently under construction, and fifteen canals are planned to be built. By the end of 1950, the power generation capacity of rural hydroelectric stations reached 20,000 kilowatts, providing sufficient electricity to 700 collective farms.

　　In the past decade, the property of collective farms has increased by 187 percent. The republic currently has 315 "millionaire collective farms" (referring to farms with income of over one million rubles), while there were only 48 before the war.

　　Georgia currently has 4,350 schools with 750,000 students and 40,000 teachers; 19 higher education institutions with 35,000 students and a total of 3,000 professors and lecturers.

　　Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic

　　Azerbaijan is a country rich in oil. Before the revolution, Azerbaijan had only four oil fields that were mined using primitive methods. After the revolution, scientists carried out extensive exploration work and discovered dozens of new oil fields. Now, exploration, drilling, and extraction are all carried out using Soviet modern technology.

　　Azerbaijan completed the industrial production volume stipulated in the post-war five-year plan in 1949 and exceeded it by 13.4 percent. The petroleum industry achieved the greatest success, and a large number of oil wells were established in the Baku harbor to extract oil from the seabed. Many workers used one machine to drill more than 4,000 meters per month.

　　In agriculture, collective farmers have completed 122 percent of the 1950 cotton production plan, exceeding the cotton production task stipulated in the post-war five-year plan by 38.8 percent. From 1946 to 1949, cotton harvest increased by approximately threefold. In 1949, 37,000 tons more cotton were harvested than before the war, and in 1950, 90,000 tons more were harvested than in 1949. In recent years, the number of tractors has increased by 60 percent, and the republic's 3,221 collective farms have been merged into 1,204 large collective farms. After the war, the income of collective farmers has greatly increased. For example, the Agdzhabedinsk cotton-producing region has 18 large collective farms, with an income of 58 million rubles in 1950.

　　This republic with a population of 3.2 million has 600,000 primary and secondary school students and 20 higher education institutions.

　　Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic

　　Armenia's industrial output level of the post-war five-year plan was completed by the end of 1949. By the end of 1950, the total industrial output had reached three times the pre-war level. In the past five years, more than 50 factories have been established, 27 factories have been expanded and renovated, and industrial sectors such as manufacturing electrical machinery, lathes, instruments, rubber, and glass have been established.

　　Armenia's five-year plan for developing agriculture has also been completed. In 1950, the cotton harvest was 150 percent of the pre-war level, tobacco 200 percent, sugar beets 250 percent, and potatoes over 300 percent. In 1950, the cultivated area increased nearly sixfold compared to 1919. In 1950, irrigated land reached 220,000 hectares, more than double that of 1919. Over 80 percent of land cultivation has been mechanized. In 1950, the number of cattle increased by 30.6 percent compared to 1940, and sheep increased by 80.6 percent.

　　In 1950, the number of employees increased by 60 percent compared to 1940, the wage fund increased by 177 percent, and the average wage of workers nearly doubled compared to 1940. The cash remuneration for labor days on collective farms more than doubled compared to 1940, and increased to four to five times on collective farms producing industrial crops. In the past four years, residential buildings with an area of 460,000 square meters have been built in cities, and 10,000 houses have been built in rural areas. Various regions have begun to build modern agricultural towns. Armenia, with a population of just over 1.28 million, has 17 higher education institutions and 44 technical schools, with 300,000 students in the ten-year system schools.

　　Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic

　　There are five federated republics in Soviet Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.

　　Uzbekistan is the Soviet Union's largest cotton-producing area, accounting for 60 percent of the Soviet Union's cotton production. The five-year plan for cotton production after the war has long been completed.

　　In recent years, the scale of water conservancy projects built by the republic is equivalent to 40 times that of the 60 years before the revolution. The degree of mechanization of cotton field cultivation is very high. In the past three years, tractor horsepower has increased by 30 percent. Last year, 3,000 cotton harvesters were used to harvest cotton. The republic's original 6,400 collective farms have been merged into 3,195 large collective farms.

　　Uzbekistan now has more than 150 textile, silk weaving, and sewing enterprises, including the large-scale Stalin Textile United Factory. The republic has established fertilizer factories to supply cotton fields, and has also established enterprises to manufacture cotton harvesting machines, spinning machines, and other machines. The speed of industrial development after the war is unprecedented. For example, in 1950, coal production was nine times that of 1946, rolled metal 30 times, and electricity 1.8 times. In the past three years, industrial production has increased by 45 percent, and increased by 83 percent compared to 1940. Last year, the income of collective farms doubled compared to the previous year, and almost all cotton-growing collective farms became "millionaire collective farms."

　　Uzbekistan, with a population of 6.28 million, currently has 5,000 primary and secondary schools with 1.3 million students; 92 secondary technical schools and 36 higher education institutions, with a total of 68,000 students. The Uzbek Academy of Sciences has 25 research institutes, and the entire republic has 1,315 libraries.

　　完成了战后五年计划的苏联十六个加盟共和国（上）
　　李何
    帝国主义者打错了许多算盘，其中有一盘就是算定苏联在战后无法治愈伟大卫国战争中所受到的创伤。然而，由于苏联社会主义制度的优越性，由于苏联人民的忘我劳动，由于苏联共产党的正确领导，苏联在战后比战前发展得更为强大了。完成了战后五年计划的苏联十六个加盟共和国的情形，便是一个最好的证据。
　俄罗斯联邦共和国
    俄罗斯联邦拥有强大的、先进的社会主义工业与农业。战前，它出产了约占全苏联的四分之三的工业品，它的小麦耕地面积占全苏联的四分之三，燕麦耕地占五分之四，马铃薯栽种面积占十分之七。俄罗斯联邦的西部地区在战争中曾受到德国法西斯匪帮的疯狂破坏。在苏联全部损失的六千七百九十亿卢布中，俄罗斯联邦的损失就占二千四百九十亿卢布，即三分之一强。
    苏联战后五年计划的基本任务是恢复战争破坏的地区，恢复工农业到达战前水平，然后超过这个水平。战后五年计划的任务在全苏联已胜利地完成了，在俄罗斯联邦也胜利地完成了。
    战后五年计划期间，俄罗斯联邦的工业总产量大大超过了战前水平。东部地区的冶金工厂现正在生产着相当于战前两倍半的辗铁。莫斯科附近的煤区，出产着三倍于战前的煤。在乌拉尔、库兹巴斯以及其他东部煤区的产煤量，相当于战时的两倍多。在巴什基尔建立了许多新的油井和炼油厂。在鞑靼自治共和国发现了巨大的油层。在萨哈连广泛进行着采油工作。莫斯科工业不到四年就完成了五年计划；在一九五○年出产了超过战前百分之五十的产品，仅在最近三年间汽车和球轴承的产量就增加了一倍以上。在乌拉尔和西伯利亚、在中央和边疆各州，新的矿厂不断地建立着，新的铁道不断地敷设着。
    俄罗斯联邦的农业是完全集体化和高度机械化了的。谷物、亚麻、大麻、马铃薯和向日葵的生产都占全苏联的第一位。仅在一九五○年，所有农作物的耕地面积就比一九四九年增加了五百八十万公顷。机器拖拉机站的工作量比一九四九年增加了百分之十五。牲畜饲养业方面，牛增加了百分之八，猪百分之二十六，羊百分之十一，马百分之十，家禽百分之四十三。去年的集体农场合并的工作，已给农业带来了新的成就。
    经济成就保证了人民的物质和文化生活水平的提高。一九五○年国营和合作社经营的商店出售的货物，比一九四九年增加了百分之三十。战后五年中，俄罗斯联邦在城市建筑了面积达几千万平方公尺的住宅，在乡村恢复和新建了一百多万所住宅。截至一九五○年年底，俄罗斯联邦的初等、七年制、中等和中等技术学校的学生有二千零六十万人。一九五○年有六十八万七千大学生在五百零二个高等学校学习。
　乌克兰共和国
    乌克兰一九五○年的工业总产量超过了战前水平百分之十五。其中机器制造业发展得最快，一九五○年的产量超过了战前水平百分之二十五。乌克兰耕地面积已经达到了战前水平，谷物和技术作物的收成，牲畜饲养业的生产都超过了战前水平。一九五○年拖拉机的工作量比一九四○年增加了百分之四十二。一九五○年全部耕地的百分之八十二用拖拉机耕种，收割工作主要是用康拜因机和其他收割机进行。农村电力站比战前增加了五万千瓦电力。去年乌克兰的三万三千六百五十三个集体农场，已合并成为一万九千五百零五个大集体农场。牲畜饲养业也有很大发展，牛比一九四○年增加了一百九十一万五千头。
    战后五年中在城市和工人住宅区恢复和新建了面积达一千三百万平方公尺的住宅。集体农场建立了九十五万所住宅和二十八万所以上的建筑物。西部地区的七年制和完全中学增加了四倍。人口四千多万的乌克兰现有一百五十八所高等学校，学生十四万七千人。乌克兰科学院领导着三十八个科学研究所。
　白俄罗斯共和国
    白俄罗斯的工业在战后有很大的发展，如以一九四五年工业总产量为一百，那么一九四六年为一五五点四，一九四七年为二二七点八，一九四八年为三二八，一九四九年为四三三点八，一九五○年为五六二；五年之中增长了五倍半。机器制造业发展得特别迅速，产量比一九四○年增长了四倍，比一九四五年增长十倍以上。农业也超过了战前水平。一九五○年集体农场的耕地超过了战前百分之十六点七。仅在一九五○年拖拉机马力就增加了一倍半。一九五○年东部地区的九千七百七十个小集体农场已合并为三千二百二十六个大集体农场。每个合并后的大农场的耕地面积平均在一千二百公顷以上。战后五年中在城市和区中心建筑了面积约四百万平方公尺的住宅，在乡村建造了四十三万六千所集体农民住宅。战后中学校的数目为战前的二点二倍，八年级至十年级学生人数为战前的三点二倍。高等学校的学生数目比战前增加了七千人。
　乔治亚共和国
    南高加索有三个加盟共和国：乔治亚、阿塞拜疆和亚美尼亚。
    乔治亚的工业发展得异常迅速。一九五○年共和国的工业生产量，按人口计算，比革命前增长了三十多倍。工业总产量还在一九四七年就已超过了战前水平，一九五○年超过战前百分之五十二。一九五○年发电能力达三十二万六千千瓦，相当于一九一三年的四十一倍。首都第比利斯有五千多名工人在五年计划中完成了六年到十年的生产定额，有八百九十二人完成了十一年到十五年的生产定额。
    乔治亚盛产茶叶、葡萄和小麦。一九四八年产茶四万六千六百吨，葡萄四万三千吨；但到一九五○年，茶叶和葡萄的产量分别增加到八万三千吨和七万一千吨以上。一九五○年小麦的产量比一九四○年增加了百分之六十三。一九五○年新开垦的土地比一九四九年增加了百分之十四。在苏维埃政权下，乔治亚共开辟了七条水渠，灌溉了二十八万八千公顷的土地；现在正建筑五条水渠，并计划建筑十五条水渠。到一九五○年底，农村水电站的发电能力达二万千瓦，使七百个集体农场获得充分的电力。
    最近十年中集体农场的财产增加了百分之一百八十七。共和国现有“百万集体农场”（按指收入在百万卢布以上的农场）三百一十五个，而战前只有四十八个。
    乔治亚现有四千三百五十所学校，学生七十五万人，教员四万人；十九所高等学校，学生三万五千人，教授和讲师共三千人。
　阿塞拜疆共和国
    阿塞拜疆是盛产石油的国家。革命前阿塞拜疆只有四个用原始方法开采的油矿场。革命后科学家们进行了广泛的探测工作，发现了几十个新油矿区。现在探测、钻井和开采都是运用苏维埃的现代化技术进行的。
    阿塞拜疆在一九四九年就完成了战后五年计划规定的工业生产量，并且超过了百分之十三点四。石油工业成就最大，在巴库海港建立了大批从海底开采的油井。许多工人运用一台机器一个月钻井四千公尺以上。
    在农业方面，集体农民已完成了一九五○年产棉计划的百分之一二二，超过了战后五年计划规定产棉任务的百分之三十八点八。从一九四六年到一九四九年棉花收成增加了约三倍，一九四九年较战前多收了三万七千吨棉花，而一九五○年又比一九四九年多收了九万吨。在最近数年间，拖拉机数目已增加百分之六十，全共和国的三千二百二十一个集体农场已合并为一千二百零四个大集体农场。战后集体农民的收入大大增加。例如：阿格查别真斯克产棉区有十八个大集体农场，一九五○年收入五千八百万卢布。
    这个拥有三百二十万人口的共和国，现有中小学生六十万人，高等学校二十所。
　亚美尼亚共和国
    亚美尼亚战后五年计划的工业产量水平已于一九四九年底完成，在一九五○年底，工业总产量已经达到战前水平的三倍。五年来建立了五十多个工厂，扩大和改造了二十七个工厂，建立了制造电气机器、车床、仪器、橡皮、玻璃等工业部门。
    亚美尼亚发展农业的五年计划也完成了。一九五○年棉花收成为战前百分之一百五十、烟草百分之二百、甜菜百分之二百五十、马铃薯百分之三百以上。一九五○年耕地面积比一九一九年增加了几近六倍。一九五○年受灌溉的土地达二十二万公顷，比一九一九年增加了一倍多。土地耕耘工作已有百分之八十以上机械化了。一九五○年牛的头数比一九四○年增加了百分之三十点六，羊增加了百分之八十点六。
    一九五○年职工人数比一九四○年增加了百分之六十，工资基金增加了百分之一百七十七，工人平均工资几较一九四○年增加了一倍。集体农场劳动日的现款报酬较一九四○年增加了一倍，在生产技术作物的集体农场则增加到四至五倍。最近四年来，在城市中建筑了面积达四十六万平方公尺的住宅，在乡村建筑了一万所房子。各区已开始建设现代化的农业城镇。人口不过一百二十八万的亚美尼亚，现有十七所高等学校和四十四所技术学校，十年制度学校的学生达三十万人。
　乌兹贝克共和国
    苏联中亚细亚有五个加盟共和国：乌兹贝克、哈萨克、吉尔吉斯、塔吉克和土库曼。
    乌兹贝克是苏联最大的产棉区，棉产量占全苏联百分之六十，战后产棉的五年计划早已完成了。
    最近几年来共和国兴建的水利工程，规模相当于革命前六十年的四十倍。棉田耕作机械化的程度很高。在最近三年中拖拉机马力增加了百分之三十，去年收获棉花使用了三千架收棉机。共和国原有的六千四百个集体农场已合并为三千一百九十五个大集体农场。
    乌兹贝克现有一百五十多个纺织、丝织、缝纫企业，其中有规模宏大的斯大林纺织联合工厂。共和国建立了供给棉田的肥料制造厂，也建立了制造收棉机器、纱车和其他机器的企业。战后工业发展的速度更为空前未有。例如：一九五○年煤产量为一九四六年的九倍，辗金属三十倍，电力一点八倍。在最近三年中，工业生产量增长了百分之四十五，比一九四○年增长了百分之八十三。去年集体农场的收入比前年增加了一倍，几乎所有植棉的集体农场都成为“百万集体农场”。
    人口六百二十八万的乌兹贝克现有中小学校五千所，学生一百三十万人；中等技术学校九十二所和高等学校三十六所，共有学生六万八千人。乌兹贝克科学院拥有二十五个研究所，全共和国有一千三百一十五所图书馆。
