　　Zhou Shizhuang, Grain Protection Model Village in Chahar Province

　　To the Editor:

    At the Chahar Province Model Grain Worker Conference, Zhou Shizhuang Village in Datong County was named a Grain Protection Model Village. I am now reporting the grain protection work of the village to you:

    Zhou Shizhuang used to be a village with many opium smokers and petty thieves. In May of last year, the village cadres and granary cadres of Zhou Shizhuang Village, responding to the call from higher authorities to "strengthen grain protection work," launched a mass grain protection campaign throughout the village. They absorbed outstanding young adults to establish a public grain management committee, and also organized a militia squad and a fire brigade to undertake tasks such as preventing theft and fire, and protecting their granary. Based on the complex situation in the village, they believed that to do a good job in grain protection, it was necessary to mobilize the masses. Therefore, they first carried out publicity through people's schools and various mass gatherings, to inspire the masses' enthusiasm for protecting public grain, correcting the common misconception among the general public that "there is only the obligation to hand over public grain, but no responsibility to protect public grain," so that every villager participated in grain protection work.

    In addition to strict night patrols, the village's public grain management committee also frequently convened symposiums with backward elements in the village, such as opium smokers and petty thieves, to persuade them to quit smoking and turn over a new leaf. The fire brigade organized all the furniture in the village that could be used for firefighting, and regularly conducted fire prevention publicity among the masses. The whole village also stipulated fire prevention regulations: 1. Parents must prohibit children from playing with fire. 2. Women must be careful when burning firewood; ashes must be poured in designated places. 3. No one is allowed to smoke near the granary or grass storage. 4. Residents lodging relatives and friends must report to the village security officer.

    The village's grain storage protection work has formed a mass movement. Everyone consciously takes on the task of protecting storage and preventing fire, and old women understand the principle that "the property of the country is the property of the people." After the "Resist America, Aid Korea" movement was launched, the villagers became even more serious about grain protection work. From May of last year to January of this year, for eight months, there were no problems with the public grain stored in the village, and therefore it won the glorious title of "Grain Protection Model Village."

    Editor's Note: The experience of Zhou Shizhuang in relying on the masses to protect public grain is worthy of learning by the cadres of villages where granaries are located.

　　察省护粮模范村——周士庄编辑同志：
    在察哈尔省模范粮食工作者会议上，大同县周士庄村被评为护粮模范村。现在我把该村护粮工作情况报告给你：
    周士庄原是一个烟民、小偷较多的村庄。去年五月间，周士庄村干部和粮库干部，响应上级“加强护粮工作”的号召，在全村展开了群众性的护粮运动。他们吸收优秀的青壮年，成立了公粮保管委员会，还组织了民兵小队和消防队，担负防盗、防火等任务，保护自己的粮库。他们根据村里复杂的情况，认为要作好护粮工作，必须发动群众。所以首先通过民校和各种群众集会进行宣传，启发群众保护公粮的积极性，纠正了一般群众“只有缴公粮的义务，没有保护公粮的责任”的错误想法，使每个村民都参加了护粮工作。
    该村公粮保管委员会，除夜间严密巡查外，并经常召集村里的烟民、小偷等落后分子开座谈会，劝他们戒烟，要他们改邪归正。消防队把全村所能用以救火的家具都组织起来，经常对群众进行防火宣传。全村并规定了防火公约：一、家长要禁止儿童玩火。二、妇女要小心烧柴；炉灰一定要倒到指定的地方。三、任何人不许到粮库、草库附近吸烟。四、各户留宿亲友要向村公安员报告。
    该村的护仓工作形成了群众运动。每一个人都自觉地负起护仓、防火的任务，老婆婆们都懂得“国家的财产就是人民的财产”的道理。儿童们发现了生人就要盘查。“抗美援朝”运动展开后，村民们对护粮工作更为认真。从去年五月至今年一月八个月中，该村存放的公粮未发生任何问题，因此获得了“护粮模范村”的光荣称号。
            林仲吾
    编者按：周士庄依靠群众保护公粮的经验，值得各粮库所在村庄的干部学习。
