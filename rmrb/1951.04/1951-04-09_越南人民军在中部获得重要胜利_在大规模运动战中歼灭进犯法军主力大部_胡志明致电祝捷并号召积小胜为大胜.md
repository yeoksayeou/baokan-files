　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the People's Army forces in Central Vietnam recently launched a large-scale mobile warfare against the French invading army in the area north of Thua Thien Province in Central Vietnam, achieving their first important victory. In late March, the French invading army authorities in Vietnam gathered eight French battalions, along with the Second Regiment of the Foreign Legion hired by them and half a battalion of the 27th Algerian Infantry Battalion, with superior forces and under the cover of aircraft and artillery, attempted to invade the People's Army base area between Thua Thien and Quang Tri provinces. The local Vietnamese People's Army forces immediately launched a large-scale mobile warfare against the invading French army, defeating the invading enemy and annihilating a large portion of its main force.
　　Prior to this, the People's Army forces in Central Vietnam had captured the French stronghold of Bo Lai north of Hoi An, the capital of Thua Thien Province, on March 19, annihilating a portion of the French army.
　　A spokesperson for the General Staff of the Vietnamese People's Army commented on this victory at a press conference on March 29, saying: This mobile warfare is as great as the campaign conducted by the People's Army in Vinh Yen Province in North Vietnam a few months ago. This campaign proves that even in difficult conditions such as those in the Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien areas, the People's Army can still make great progress in mobile warfare and annihilate a large portion of the enemy's main force. The spokesperson pointed out: "This victory will have a great impact favorable to our army on the battlefields of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien."
　　The organ of the Vietnam Lien Viet Front, "Cuu Quoc" (National Salvation) newspaper, also published a commentary on March 24, warmly celebrating this great victory. The commentary pointed out: This victory is the greatest victory achieved by the People's Army in Central Vietnam since the beginning of the Vietnamese War of Liberation. This victory is the result of the army's unprecedented progress in overcoming many difficulties with the active support of the people and its growing strength in the long-term war of resistance. The commentary concluded: "This victory clearly tells the French imperialists that not only in North Vietnam, but also in Central and South Vietnam, the People's Army forces have enough strong power to give the enemy heavy blows."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, North Vietnam, 6th: President Ho Chi Minh sent a telegram on the 3rd of this month to the People's Army forces and people in the Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien areas of Central Vietnam, congratulating them on the great victories they had achieved in March. The telegram stated: "I extend my sincere congratulations to the army and people of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien who have won a significant victory. This victory was achieved thanks to the heroism of the army, the active support of the people, and the unity between the army, the people, and the government. However, our army and people must not be complacent because of this victory, nor should they underestimate the enemy. On the contrary, we must work harder and be more cautious. We must remember that as far as the Fourth Military Region (northern part of Central Vietnam) is concerned, our strategy is that mobile warfare is of paramount importance, and we must accumulate small victories into great ones. We must also remember that our resistance war must go through a long and arduous struggle to achieve complete victory."

　　越南人民军在中部获得重要胜利 
　 在大规模运动战中歼灭进犯法军主力大部
　  胡志明致电祝捷并号召积小胜为大胜
    【新华社八日讯】据越南通讯社消息：越南中部的人民军部队，最近在中越承天省以北地区对法国侵略军展开大规模运动战，获得第一次的重要胜利。三月下旬，侵越法军当局纠集了法军八个连以及雇佣来的外籍军团第二团和阿尔及利亚步兵第二十七营半个营的优势兵力，在飞机大炮掩护下，企图进犯承天、广治两省之间的人民军的根据地。当地的越南人民军部队随即对进犯的法军展开了大规模的运动战，打垮了进犯的敌军，并歼灭其主力的一大部分。
    在此以前，中越的人民军部队曾在三月十九日拔除了承天省会安以北的法军据点搏来，歼法军一部。
    越南人民军总部发言人三月二十九日在记者招待会上评论这一胜利时说：这一场运动战和几个月之前人民军在北越永安省进行的战役同样伟大。这一战役证明：即使在广平、广治、承天地区那样困难的条件下，人民军仍然能在运动战方面获得很大的进展，歼灭敌军的一大部分主力。发言人指出：“在广平、广治和承天的战场上，这个胜利将产生有利于我军的伟大影响。”
    越联阵线机关报《救国报》于三月二十四日发表评论，也热烈欢呼这一伟大胜利。评论指出：这一胜利是越南解放战争开始以来，人民军在中越所获得的最伟大的胜利。这一胜利是该地区军队在人民的积极支援下克服许多困难、获得空前进步、在长期抗战中日益成长的结果。评论最后说：“这次胜利明白地告诉法帝国主义者：不仅在北越，而且在中越和南越，人民军部队也有足够的给敌人沉重打击的强大力量。”
    【新华社八日讯】越南通讯社北越六日讯：胡志明主席于本月三日致电越南中部广平、广治、承天地区的人民军部队和人民，祝贺他们在三月间所获得的巨大胜利。电称：“我向赢得了相当重大的胜利的广平、广治、承天的军队和人民致亲切的祝贺。这个胜利是由于军队的英雄主义、人民的积极支持和军、民与政府间的团结才获得的。但是我们的军队和人民不要因这一胜利而自满，也不要过低估计敌人。相反地，我们必须更加努力，更加谨慎。我们要记住：就第四军区（中越的北部）而论，我们的战略是运动战占头等重要地位，我们要积小胜为大胜。我们还必须记住：我们的抗战，必须经过长期的艰苦的努力，才能获得完全的胜利。”
