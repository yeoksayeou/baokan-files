　　Volunteer Army Heavily Strikes the Enemy Invading North from Seoul
　　Over 2,200 American Soldiers Annihilated in Ten Days
    [Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 6th] The American invading forces, which have been invading north from Seoul, have suffered heavy blows from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in recent days, suffering heavy casualties and making very little progress. From March 16th to 25th, the American army, with the support of massive artillery fire, tanks, and aircraft, launched an offensive against the positions of a certain unit of our Volunteer Army. The unit defended its advantageous positions and resisted at every step. According to preliminary statistics, a total of 2,227 American soldiers were killed or wounded in ten days, 7 enemies were captured, 14 tanks and 29 vehicles were destroyed, and a large number of various guns and cannons were seized. The American invading forces advanced only one and a half kilometers per day on average.
    In the battle, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army displayed a high degree of revolutionary heroism, and many exemplary battles with outnumbered forces emerged. For example, the eighth squad of a certain company repelled four charges from an enemy battalion in one day, and the American invading forces abandoned more than 200 corpses in front of their position. The soldiers of the unit known as the "Red Flag" destroyed six enemy tanks in front of their position one day. The lone hero warrior Wang Tingji defended a hill alone, repelling repeated enemy charges and attracting four enemy aircraft and four howitzers to blindly bombard from 5:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., powerfully supporting the victorious operations of the main positions.

　　志愿军沉重打击自汉城北犯之敌
　  十天歼美军二千二百余
    【新华社朝鲜前线六日电】自汉城北犯之美国侵略军，连日遭我国人民志愿军某部沉重打击，伤亡惨重，进展甚微。自三月十六日至二十五日，美军在大量炮火、坦克及飞机配合下，向我志愿军某部阵地进攻。该部据守有利阵地，节节阻击。据初步统计，在十天内共毙伤美军二千二百二十七名，俘敌七名，击毁坦克十四辆，汽车二十九辆，缴获各种枪炮甚多。而美国侵略军平均每日仅前进一公里半。
    在作战中，中国人民志愿军某部发扬了高度的革命英雄主义，涌现出许多以少胜多的模范战例。如某连第八班一天打退敌人一个营兵力的四次冲锋，在他们的阵地前面美国侵略军遗弃的尸体达二百余具。被称为“红旗”部的战士们有一天在阵地前炸毁敌人坦克六辆。孤胆英雄战士王庭吉一个人坚守一个山头，打退了敌人的反复冲锋，吸引敌人四架飞机、四门榴弹炮从早晨五点钟盲目地轰击到下午两点，有力地支援了主要阵地的胜利作战。
