　　Newspapers Should Strive to Popularize and Deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement

　　In the past six months, newspapers in various regions have focused their efforts on conducting current affairs propaganda and ideological education regarding resisting America and aiding Korea to protect the homeland. They have achieved significant results and played a vital role in launching and promoting the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Now that the Resist America, Aid Korea movement is further developing towards popularization and depth, newspapers should also continue to strive for the popularization and deepening of this movement. To better leverage the role of newspapers, we offer the following issues based on preliminary investigation and research, hoping to draw the attention of newspaper workers in various regions.

　　The Resist America, Aid Korea movement has been a broad mass movement from the start. The Northeast Daily has reflected the enthusiasm of workers and peasants in Northeast China to actively participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement to protect their good lives from many angles. Newspapers in Shanghai and Tianjin, as well as the Chongqing Xinhua Daily, have vigorously reflected the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in industrial and commercial circles and religious circles, achieving certain results. However, compared to the scale and requirements of the movement itself, the propaganda in newspapers is still insufficient in both breadth and depth. One significant shortcoming is that many newspapers report on the situation in large cities but rarely report on the situation in small and medium-sized cities and rural areas. The Chongqing Xinhua Daily's reports in November of last year were almost limited to Chongqing City. After December, it increased its coverage of other large cities, but some important activities remained outside the newspaper's view. On December 19th, Xinhua News Agency broadcast news of the vigorous development of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in small and medium-sized cities in Southwest China, but before this, the Xinhua Daily either did not report on the situation in these places or only touched upon it slightly without giving it due importance. The Yangtze River Daily's propaganda mainly focused on the situation in cities along the Yuehan Railway line. In December, it hardly reported on the situation in Guangxi Province, and thereafter, it only had a small amount of dynamic reports. Reports on the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in rural areas and among farmers are generally insufficient. From October of last year to March 10th of this year, in nearly half a year, the Chongqing Xinhua Daily had less than twenty articles reporting on farmers' Resist America, Aid Korea activities. Reports in local newspapers on rural land reform, eliminating bandits, opposing local bullies, rent reduction, and return of deposits are generally not linked to the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, even though this connection actually exists. These shortcomings should be corrected.

　　It is essential to publish vivid reflections of people from all walks of life in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in newspapers. For example, the Shanghai newspapers published the just demands of the families of martyrs Wang Xiaohe, Liang Renda, and Zang Dayaozi, who were persecuted by the US-Chiang Kai-shek clique, on November 4th of last year, which had a great mobilizing force. However, some newspapers only publish statements and talks by the leading organs of various parties and people's organizations when reporting on many major events. These materials are a concentrated expression of the people's will and are important, but if, in addition to these documents, more vivid and concrete reflections from the masses are not published, the result will be that the propaganda will have bones but no flesh and will not show the actual depth. Similar shortcomings are also manifested in many aspects. For example, in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, workers and peasants launched patriotic production competitions, which achieved great results. Some newspapers, such as the Northeast Daily and the Hebei Daily, reported on the development of the competition, reported on the progress of production in the competition, raised new questions, and guided the movement forward. However, many newspapers, besides reporting on the enthusiastic situation when the competition was launched, rarely reported on the actual results of the competition. The Shandong Rural Mass Daily published many news items about production competitions in five and a half months, but only a few, such as labor model Zhang Fugui's report on preliminary achievements, had reports of actual results. For example, many patriotic covenants have been made in various places, but few reports on the actual implementation of patriotic covenants are seen in newspapers. These shortcomings have deprived newspapers of much vivid and rich content that they could have had.

　　The Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda in the past six months has greatly improved the persuasiveness of newspapers, and many persuasive materials have appeared in newspapers. When Shanghai's major newspapers condemned US imperialism, they organized many powerful articles to illustrate the destruction of national industry and commerce by US imperialism, the poisoning of youth by American films, etc., with the people's personal feelings. When opposing the rearmament of Japan by US imperialism, newspapers in various places painfully recalled the past atrocities of the Japanese invaders in various places, and the power exerted by this propaganda was great. Various persuasive tools have also been well utilized. City newspapers have made extensive use of the most persuasive weapon - photos and cartoons. Rural newspapers have used persuasive tools such as popular literature and art. The Shandong Rural Mass Daily published the drum lyric "The Daughter's Enemy," adapted from Jin Tai Tai's accusation in Tianjin, which promoted its adoption in various places and was greatly welcomed. However, the newspaper's persuasion generally only achieved greater success in the accusations against the United States and Japan, and there are few positive persuasive materials. Some newspapers in Shanghai published some good reports on wise parents enthusiastically sending their children to military cadre schools in the movement of young people participating in military cadre schools, but there were also some incorrect reports on young people "persuading" their parents. For example, some children threatened their mothers, who insisted on not letting them participate in military cadre schools, with electric shock suicide, and the newspaper even said that this was "steel will breaking through difficulties." In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the ideological awareness of the masses of all strata has been universally improved, and new people, new families, and new production groups have emerged everywhere. The transformation of many people contains rich and tortuous content. However, these specific and vivid materials have not been fully utilized. This newspaper published an article by Bu Chunsheng, a teacher at Beijing Beiman Girls' Middle School, entitled "Changes in My Family in the Past Two Years" on January 31, and the Shanghai News Daily held a solicitation of articles entitled "How I Came to Know US Imperialism," which touched on some of these types of materials, but there are few similar examples. Newspapers in various places should strive to collect and write these materials, report on the changes of typical people, families, neighborhoods, villages, production teams, workshops, etc., and enrich the newspaper's Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda with the rich content in the changes of the masses' lives and enhance the newspaper's positive persuasive effect.

　　The Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda has also improved the guidance of newspapers. From October to early December 1950, due to the development of the situation and the lack of a correct understanding of American imperialism, there was ideological confusion of varying degrees among people of all strata. Many newspapers at this time adopted different methods and combined the propaganda of "understanding America" to explain and criticize these ideas. For example, the Northeast Daily published a series of papers explaining the weaknesses of the United States in military terms, and before the liberation of Pyongyang, it published fourteen answers to readers' questions to solve ideological problems. The Liberation Daily published more than a dozen answers to readers' questions in November, explaining why we cannot ignore the Korean War, exposing the essence of US imperialism's aggression, and criticizing erroneous ideas such as "closed-door construction." The Shandong Rural Mass Daily organized readers to conduct discussions in a planned way, solved the ideological problems of many farmers, and from the discussion of "Why does US imperialism invade Korea" in mid-November 1950, it continued to March of this year, guiding readers to discuss and understand "Why we should love the motherland" in a progressively in-depth manner, which were relatively successful examples. Because newspapers can conduct propaganda in a planned way and "shoot the arrow at the target" for specific ideological problems among the readers, the guidance of newspapers has been considerably improved, and this important harvest and progress should be promoted. But it is worth noting that from mid-December, after the significant ideological confusion among the masses was resolved, there were fewer articles in newspapers that provided answers to specific ideological problems. Obviously, we cannot think that there have been no new ideological problems among the masses since then. The key is that we have not conducted an in-depth analysis and study of the ideological activities of the masses, and therefore, we have not discovered new problems. This is an important aspect that we should continue to work on.

　　The Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement is a long-term and arduous ideological task. Striving to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement is the center and soul of all work, and therefore, it is also the most important theme of newspaper propaganda. To continue to do this work well, strengthening planning, persuasion, and guidance are several main topics. One of the main shortcomings of newspaper Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda in the past is the lack of breadth and depth. It is necessary for newspapers in various regions to conduct an inspection in these areas to see which places have been reported and which places have not; which places have the movement launched and which places are not yet full, and organize reports and comment on them in a planned way based on these inspections to promote the movement forward. Only in this way can propaganda play a guiding and leading role and achieve the purpose of educating everyone in every place in Resist America, Aid Korea patriotism. The Yangtze River Daily has recently published some reports on the situation of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in small and medium-sized cities in the Central and Southern regions in the most prominent position, which is meaningful. Newspapers should have sharp eyes and use their greatest efforts to continue to eliminate those blank areas where the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has not been fully launched or even has not been launched at all.

### 报纸应该为普及和深入抗美援朝运动而奋斗

　　报纸应该为普及和深入抗美援朝运动而奋斗
    半年来，各地报纸以主要力量进行抗美援朝保卫祖国的时事宣传和思想教育，已经获得了很大的成绩，对展开和推动抗美援朝运动起了很大的作用。现在，抗美援朝运动正在进一步向普及和深入发展，报纸也应该为普及和深入抗美援朝运动而继续奋斗。为了能更好地发挥报纸的作用，特根据初步调查研究的结果，提出以下几个问题，希望引起各地报纸工作者的注意。
    抗美援朝运动从一开始便是很广泛的群众运动。东北日报从许多角度反映了东北工人农民为了保卫自己的美好生活而积极参加抗美援朝运动的热情；上海天津各报、重庆新华日报等大力反映了工商界宗教界的抗美援朝运动，都有一定的成绩。但是与运动本身的规模和要求比较起来，报纸上的宣传在广度和深度上都还是很不够的。显著的缺点之一是许多报纸报道了大城市的情况，却很少报道中小城市和农村中的情况。重庆新华日报去年十一月份的报道几乎只限于重庆市，十二月份以后增加了一些其他大城市情况的报道，但有些重要的活动仍旧停留在该报视野以外。十二月十九日新华社播出了西南各中小城市抗美援朝运动蓬勃展开的消息，而前此新华日报对这些地方的情形或者未加报道，或者只略为涉及，未予重视。长江日报的宣传主要表现了沿粤汉线各城市的情形，在十二月份几乎没有报道广西省的情形，此后也只有少量动态的报道。对农村和农民中抗美援朝运动的报道一般的都不很充分。重庆新华日报由去年十月起到今年三月十日止近半年时间中，关于农民抗美援朝活动的报道不到二十篇。各地报纸关于农村土地改革、肃清土匪、反对恶霸、减租、退押等斗争的报道，一般地没有与抗美援朝运动联系起来，而这种联系是实际存在着的。这些缺点应该注意纠正。
    在报纸上发表各阶层人民群众在抗美援朝运动中的各种生动反映，是很必要的。例如上海各报去年十一月四日发表了被美蒋残害的王孝和、梁仁达、臧大咬子诸烈士家属的正义的要求，就有极大的鼓动力量。但是有些报纸对许多重大事件的反映只是发表了各党派、各人民团体领导机关的声明和谈话，这些材料是人民意志的一种集中的表现，是重要的，但如果在这些文件以外，不更多地发表来自群众中的生动具体的反映，结果便会使宣传有骨无肉，不能显出实际的深度。类此的缺点还表现在许多方面。例如在抗美援朝运动中工人农民展开了爱国主义生产竞赛，这竞赛获得了很大的成绩，有些报纸如东北日报、河北日报，报道了竞赛的展开，也报道竞赛中生产的进步，提出新的问题，指导运动前进。但有不少报纸除了报道挑战应战等竞赛展开时的热烈情况之外，很少关于竞赛的实际结果的报道；山东农村大众报在五个半月中发表了不少生产竞赛的消息，只有劳动模范张富贵报告初步成绩等极少几篇有实际结果的报道。再如各地各界订立了不少爱国公约，从报纸上却很少看到爱国公约实际执行情形的报道。这些缺点使报纸失去了许多可以有的生动而丰富的内容。
    近半年来的抗美援朝宣传，使报纸的鼓动性大大提高了一步，报纸上出现了许多具有鼓动性的材料。上海的几家大报在控诉美帝国主义时，组织了许多有力的文章，以人民亲自的感受说明美帝国主义对民族工商业的摧残，美国电影对青年的毒害等；在反对美帝国主义重新武装日本时，各地报纸沉痛地回忆了日寇过去在各地的暴行，这些宣传所发挥的威力是很大的。各种鼓动工具也很好地被利用了，城市报纸大量利用了有最大鼓动力量的武器——照片和漫画，农村报纸使用了通俗文艺等鼓动工具，山东农村大众报发表了根据天津金太太的控诉编成的大鼓词《亲女仇》，推动各地采用，受到了很大的欢迎。但是报纸的鼓动一般地只在对美日的控诉上有较大的成绩，正面的鼓动性的材料很少。上海有些报纸在青年参加军事干部学校运动中发表了一些贤明的家长热烈送子弟参加军事干部学校的好的报道，但是也有一些不正确地宣传青年“说服”家长的材料。例如有的子弟用触电自杀来威胁坚持不让他参加军事干部学校的母亲，报纸竟说这是“钢铁的意志冲破了困难”。在抗美援朝运动中，各阶层群众的思想觉悟普遍地提高了，新的人物，新的家庭，新的生产小组到处涌现出来，在许多人的转变中都包含着丰富而曲折的内容。但是这些具体生动的材料还没有充分地加以利用。本报一月三十一日曾发表了北京贝满女中教员步春生作的《我家两年来的变化》，上海新闻日报举行了《我怎样认识了美帝》的征文，接触了一些这一类材料，但类此的例子是不多的。各地报纸都应该努力采写这些材料，报道典型的人、家庭、里弄、村落、生产小组、车间等的变化，用群众生活变化中的丰富的内容来充实报纸的抗美援朝宣传，增强报纸的正面的鼓动作用。
    抗美援朝的宣传也曾使报纸的指导性提高了一步。从一九五○年十月到十二月初，由于局势的发展和对美国帝国主义还缺少正确的认识，各阶层人民中曾存在着各种程度不同的思想上的混乱，许多报纸在这时采用了不同的方法，结合“认识美国”的宣传，针对这些思想做了解释和批判。例如东北日报发表了一系列的论文说明美国在军事上的弱点，并在平壤解放以前发表了十四篇解决思想问题的答读者问。解放日报在十一月中发表了十几篇答读者问，说明我们为什么不能对朝鲜战争置之不理，揭露美帝国主义侵略的本质，批判了“关门建设”等错误思想。山东农村大众报有组织地发动读者进行讨论，解决了许多农民群众中的思想问题，由一九五○年十一月中讨论“美帝为什么侵略朝鲜”开始，继续到今年三月，层层深入地引导读者一直到讨论和认识“为什么要爱护祖国”，都是比较成功的例子。由于报纸能有计划地针对读者群众中的具体思想问题“有的放矢”地进行宣传，便相当地提高了报纸的指导性，这个重要的收获和进步是应该加以发扬的。但值得注意的是从十二月中旬起，在群众中的显著的思想混乱解决了之后，报纸上便少见到针对具体思想问题加以解答的文章了。显然，我们不能认为从那时起群众中就没有新的思想问题发生，关键只在于我们没有对群众的思想活动进行深入一步的分析和研究，因此也便没有发掘出新的问题来。这是我们应该继续努力的一个重要的方面。
    抗美援朝爱国运动是一个长期的艰巨的思想工作。为普及和深入抗美援朝运动而奋斗是一切工作的中心和灵魂，因此也是报纸宣传的头等重要的主题。为了继续做好这个工作，加强计划性、鼓动性和指导性是几个主要的课题。过去报纸抗美援朝宣传的主要缺点之一是广度和深度不够，各地报纸有必要在这些方面作一次检查，看看究竟那些地方报道了，那些地方还没有；那些地方运动展开了，那些地方还不充分，根据这些检查来有计划地组织报道并加以评论，推动运动前进。只有这样才能使宣传发生指导和引导的作用，达到使每处每人都受到抗美援朝爱国主义教育的目的。长江日报最近几天曾在最显著的地位发表了一些中南地区中小城市抗美援朝运动情况的报道，这是有意义的。报纸应当眼光四射，以最大的力量来为继续消灭那些尚未充分展开甚至根本没有展开抗美援朝运动的若干空白的地区而奋斗。
