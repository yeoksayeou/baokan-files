　　U.S. Preparations in Thailand
    Ou Weiqun
    The U.S. military advisory group in Thailand is training and equipping the Thai military according to its own plans, and deploying new military strongholds to make Thailand an important base for U.S. imperialism's aggression in Southeast Asia. This work is being intensified unreservedly with the full "cooperation" of the Phibunsongkhram reactionary government.
    The U.S. military advisory group has obtained the right to participate in Thai high-level military meetings; the distribution of U.S. military aid to Thailand is carried out by the so-called "U.S. Aid Military Supplies Distribution Committee" jointly formed by Thailand and the United States. The Thai representative is the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defense, and the U.S. representative is Brigadier General Cole, the head of the U.S. military advisory group. Obviously, the final decision-making power on how to distribute military supplies is in the hands of General Cole, who served as the commander of the U.S. 5th Armored Division in World War II.
    Cole arrived in Bangkok on January 12 to be responsible for implementing the expansion plan - expanding the Thai army from the original three corps to five, the air force from one group to three, and the navy will add 34 new ships. According to the Thai Foreign Minister, this U.S. military advisory group has a total of dozens of people, divided into sea, land, and air groups, and has arrived and started work.
    In addition to training the army to use various types of American weapons, and training the army and police to practice mountain warfare, forest warfare, and guerrilla warfare, the most important task of the U.S. military advisory group is to supervise the establishment of new garrison bases, investigate the traffic, terrain, and borders of various places, especially the northern and northeastern regions.
    The United States held a demonstrative military handover ceremony in Bangkok on January 24. This batch of military supplies, according to Luang Phrom Yothi, Chairman of the "U.S. Aid Receiving Committee" and Chief of the Thai Navy General Staff, is only part of the military supplies originally valued at 10 million U.S. dollars, and less than half of it. The original plan was to deliver these 10 million U.S. dollars worth of military supplies in four years. Phibunsongkhram felt it was too long, so shortening the deadline for the delivery of military supplies became another whip in the hands of the United States over the Thai government. In mid-February, U.S. imperialists told the Thai reactionary government that the original four years could be shortened to two years, and additional military supplies could be given to Thailand, but "hope to thoroughly shoulder the anti-communist mission."
    The U.S. military advisory group is also actively training and equipping the Thai police to become a disguised army. The Thai police can also obtain "U.S. aid" military supplies, and can directly purchase military supplies from the United States at low prices. The amount and type of purchases are determined by a joint committee. After the purchase, U.S. weapons experts will guide the use. The first batch of military supplies purchased by the Thai police also arrived in mid-February.
    The original stipulation for the U.S. military advisory group to be stationed in Thailand was one year, but now it has been extended indefinitely.
    The activities of the U.S. military advisory group in the past two months have been almost entirely concentrated in the north, centered on Chiang Mai, and the northeast, centered on Ubon Ratchathani. Most of the "U.S. aid military supplies" have also been transported to these two regions. As for southern Thailand, which borders Malaysia, the weapons used by the military and police are mostly obtained from the United Kingdom. At least for now, the U.S. military advisory group has not taken care of various military activities in southern Thailand. From this, it can also be seen that the U.S. activities in Thailand are aimed at attacking New China and Vietnam.
    The first military stronghold that the United States deployed in Thailand is the north, centered on Chiang Mai. Chiang Mai is less than 400 li from the border of China's Yunnan Province, such as Fo Hai. This is the end point of the railway between northern Thailand and Bangkok, has an airport, and has a highway north through Chiang Rai to Yotse on the northern Thai border; Yotse is about 200 kilometers in a straight line from Chiang Mai.
    On December 12, 1950, the new U.S. consulate in Chiang Mai officially opened. The puppet embassy of the Kuomintang remnants in Thailand established an office in Yotse at the end of November last year to contact and command the 93rd Division of the Chiang remnants on the Thai-Burmese border. At the end of last year, this group of remnants was used as the basis to organize the so-called "International Anti-Communist Volunteer Division." Since January this year, many officers of the Chiang Kai-shek army "93rd Division" have openly entered Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and other places to carry out activities, and purchased large quantities of medicines, batteries, etc. In early February, reliable sources in Bangkok said that the United States was determined to reorganize the Chiang Kai-shek army, wait for an opportunity to attack Yunnan, and had sent special personnel to transport more than 100,000 rounds of ammunition and weapons by plane to Yotse for transfer to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Kengtung, Burma, and promised to allocate more than 100,000 baht (Thai currency) as the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' military pay. At the same time, a large number of Kuomintang secret agents who had been trained at the "Sino-American Cadre Training Corps" in Kunming and Fo Hai came from Bangkok to Chiang Mai and other places, using various occupations as cover, to collect intelligence and supply U.S. military attachés stationed in Thailand.
    Directly controlling the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on the Thai-Burmese border is one of the central tasks of the United States in northern Thailand.
    Another central task of the U.S. military advisory group in northern Thailand is to survey terrain, establish new military bases, and train troops. Since January this year, Thai aircraft under the command of U.S. military officers have frequently practiced flying over the various provinces and counties on the northern Thai border. General Nai Pin, Commander-in-Chief of the Thai Army, accompanied by U.S. military officers, inspected Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and other places. U.S. experts investigated whether the airports in Chiang Mai and other places were suitable for use. The U.S. military advisory group decided to establish a huge military camp in Lampang, between Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai, to train soldiers, believing that this place has convenient transportation and can control the Thai-Burmese border. The Thai police also plan to set up a training camp in Chiang Mai to establish a "police field team."
    At the same time as the U.S. military advisory group is conducting activities in northern Thailand, there are various "experts" sent by the United States. A U.S. special economic and technical team of more than ten people inspected the transportation, water conservancy and agriculture in northern Chiang Mai, Lampang, and northeastern and western Thailand at the end of January. The task of this technical team in transportation is to build highways and railways; these highways and railways are of course of military significance. The so-called "mining experts" and "forestry experts" also came to Chiang Mai and other places to inspect.
    Chiang Mai has also become the base camp for U.S. imperialists to carry out cultural aggression in Thailand.
    The U.S. consulate in Chiang Mai has a fairly large press office and library. All kinds of gatherings or festivals are opportunities for U.S. imperialists to send out propaganda. The church under the command of U.S. imperialists held a large gathering in Chiang Mai at the end of last year to discuss strengthening missionary activities and increasing the number of church schools and hospitals.
    After the war, Thailand borrowed 10 million U.S. dollars from the United States to purchase surplus materials. The United States is about to invest this money in "sponsoring and developing Thai education," and a "Charitable Education Committee" jointly formed by the United States and Thailand will handle and use this fund. At the end of January this year, this committee held a meeting in Chiang Mai and decided to "sponsor" students in northern Thailand to study in U.S. church schools, giving each person a "sponsorship" fee of 3,000 baht (Thai currency) per year.
    Another military stronghold that the United States deployed in Thailand is the northeast, centered on Ubon Ratchathani. Ubon Ratchathani has an airport and is the end point of the railway between northeastern Thailand and Bangkok. The sound of machine guns from the Lao People's Liberation Army fighting against the French army on the other side of the Mekong River can be heard very clearly in the counties bordering Ubon Ratchathani Province (the border separates the Mekong River from the Lao national border).
    Under the command of the United States, the Phibunsongkhram government has been carrying out various deployments in the northeast since last year. In August last year, the Phibunsongkhram government forced Vietnamese expatriates to live in certain areas of the northeast, not allowing them to be dispersed, in order to manage them. After the 6th Division of the Thai Army stationed in Warin Chamrap District of Ubon Ratchathani Province (the district border is separated from the Lao national border by the Mekong River) was expanded in October last year, it conducted detailed mapping of the mountainous areas on the Thai-Vietnamese border and stationed troops in key points on the border. In early December last year, Thai and U.S. military personnel arrived in Ubon Ratchathani and held a meeting with the 6th Division to discuss the border situation and the allocation and use of new weapons. Since then, several U.S. instructors have gone to the division to train them in the use of new weapons and collect intelligence.
    The Thai Air Force Department also sent special personnel to Ubon Ratchathani and other places to inspect and plan to repair the airport built during the Japanese occupation.
    After the first batch of U.S. military supplies was handed over to the Thai side, part of it was delivered to the 6th Division stationed in Warin Chamrap.
    The Thai police are also actively strengthening their strength on the Thai-Vietnamese border. These border police are equipped with rocket launchers, heavy machine guns, tanks, and radio communication equipment. At the same time, the police are also exploring and mapping the mountainous terrain in various parts of the northeast.
    The U.S. military advisory group is also preparing to go to the northeast to survey the situation. The U.S. military attaché in Thailand plans to set up a liaison office in Ubon Ratchathani. Two classes of spy training courses held by the U.S. and Thailand in Bangkok have graduated special agents and sent them to the northeast. "Missionaries" from the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Baptist Church, Catholic Church and other organizations under the command of U.S. imperialists are constantly "traveling" in various parts of the northeast and on the Thai-Vietnamese border.
    U.S. so-called special economic and technical teams, wireless telephone and telegraph experts from the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration in Thailand, and sugar industry experts have all come to inspect Ubon Ratchathani, Nakhon Ratchasima, Nong Khai and other places in the northeast.
    The French military attaché in Thailand also went to Ubon Ratchathani in January, and passed through the Thai-Vietnamese border to the French-occupied area to consult with French personnel.
    In January, Thai newspapers reported that news revealed by senior Thai staff officers said: The plan for the war against Vietnam has been arranged, and as soon as the United States gives the order, it can be started!
    The U.S. imperialists' war preparations in Thailand through the Phibunsongkhram reactionary government are making the Thai people increasingly aware. Despite various obstacles, the number of signatures for the Stockholm Peace Appeal has increased to 100,000; the call against intervention in Vietnam is rising. The Thai people hate war.

　　美国在泰国的备战活动
    欧为群
    美国驻泰国军事顾问团正按照它自己的计划训练及装备泰国的军力，布置新的军事据点，使泰国成为美国帝国主义侵略东南亚的重要基地。这一工作在銮披汶反动政府全力“合作”之下，毫无掩饰地加紧进行着。
    美国军事顾问团已取得参加泰国高级军事会议的权利；美国运泰军火的分配，交由泰美双方合组的所谓“美援军火分配委员会”执行。泰方代表是国防部参谋长、美方是美国军事顾问团团长柯尔准将。显然，军火如何分配的最后决定权，是掌握在这位第二次世界大战中曾担任过美军第五装甲师师长的柯尔将军手中的。
    柯尔在一月十二日到曼谷，负责执行扩军方案——将泰国陆军由原有的三个军扩充到五个，空军由一大队扩充到三大队，海军则将增加新舰艇三十四艘。据泰国外长说，美国这一军事顾问团人员共数十人，分海、陆、空三组，业已到齐，并开始工作。
    除了训练军队使用各类型美式武器、训练陆军及警察练习山地战、森林战、游击战以外，美国军事顾问团最重要的工作是监督设立新的驻军基地，调查各地交通、地势以及边疆，特别是北部及东北部的情况。
    美国于一月二十四日在曼谷举行了示威性的军火移交典礼。这批军火，据“美援接收委员会”主席泰国海军总参谋銮蓬拉信说，是原定价值一千万美元军火中之一部分，尚不及一半。这一千万美元军火，原定是四年交清的。銮披汶觉得太久了，于是缩短交清军火的期限，就成为美国对泰国政府手中的另一条皮鞭。二月中，美国帝国主义者向泰国反动政府表示，可以将原定的四年缩为二年，而且可以以额外的军火交给泰国，但“希望彻底肩起反共任务”。
    美国军事顾问团也正积极将泰国警察训练及装备成为变相的陆军。泰国警察同样可以获得“美援”军火，并可以以低廉价格直接向美国购买军火。至于购买的数额、种类，由双方合组的委员会决定。买来后，由美国武器专家指导使用。泰国警察首批购来的军火，也于二月中旬运到。
    美国军事顾问团驻泰期间，原来规定是一年，现在已延长到无限期了。
    美国军事顾问团两月来的活动足迹几乎完全集中在以清迈为中心的北部，以乌汶为中心的东北部。“美援军火”也大部运到这两个地区。至于与马来亚接壤的泰国南部，军警所用的武器，绝大部分是得自英国。至少在目前，泰国南部的各种军事活动，美国军事顾问团还未照顾到。从这里也可看出，美国在泰国的活动，是以新中国及越南为进攻对象的。
    美国在泰国布置的第一个军事据点，是以清迈为中心的北部。清迈距中国云南省边界佛海等地不及四百里。这里是泰北与曼谷间铁路的终点，有机场，并有公路北经昌莱到泰北边界上的夜柿；夜柿距清迈直线距离约两百公里。
    一九五○年十二月十二日，美国在清迈新设的领事馆正式开馆。国民党残匪驻泰伪使馆去年十一月末在夜柿设立办事处，联络及指挥泰缅边境上蒋残匪九十三师。去年末，就以这批残匪为基础，组织所谓“国际反共志愿师”。今年一月以来，蒋匪军“九三师”军官多人，公开进入清迈、昌莱等地活动，并大批购买药品、电池等。二月初，曼谷方面可靠消息称：美国决意整编蒋匪军，待机进攻云南，并已派专人用飞机装载子弹十余万发及武器等送至夜柿转交缅境景栋蒋匪，并允拨款十余万铢（泰币）作为蒋匪粮饷。与此同时，曾在昆明及佛海受“中美干训团”训练过的大批国民党特务，由曼谷至清迈等地，以各种职业为掩护，刺探情报，供给美国驻泰武官。
    直接掌握泰缅边境上蒋匪帮残余，是美国在泰北活动的中心工作之一。
    美国军事顾问团在泰北的另一中心工作，是勘察地形、建立新的军事基地、训练部队。今年一月以来，美军官指挥下的泰国飞机，经常在泰北边境各府县上空练习飞行。泰军总司令乃屏中将偕同美籍军官视察清迈及昌莱等地，美国专家调查了清迈等地机场是否合用。美国军事顾问团决定在清迈与昌莱之间的南邦设立巨大军营，训练士兵，认为此地交通便利，可控制泰缅边境。泰国警察也拟在清迈设立训练营地，成立“警察野战队”。
    与美国军事顾问团同时在泰北进行活动的有美国派来的各种各样的“专家”。美国专门经济技术团一行十余人，于一月末视察北部清迈、南邦以及泰国东北部及西部的交通、水利农业情况。这一技术团在交通方面的任务是建筑公路，兴建铁路；这些公路铁路当然是有军事意义的。到清迈等地视察的，还有所谓“矿务专家”、“农林专家”等。
    清迈也成为了美帝国主义者在泰国进行文化侵略的大本营。
    清迈美国领事馆附设有规模相当大的新闻处及图书馆。各种各样集会或节日，都是美帝国主义者发送宣传品的机会。美帝国主义者指挥下的教会，去年底在清迈举行一次大集会，商讨加强传教活动，增设教会学校及医院。
    战后，泰国曾向美国借款一千万元购买剩余物资。美国即将此款投资在“赞助及发展泰国教育”的用途上，由美泰两方合组“慈善教育委员会”处理并使用这笔款项。今年一月末，这一委员会在清迈举行会议，决定“赞助”泰国北部学生进入美教会学校读书，每人每年给予“赞助”费三千铢（泰币）。
    美国在泰国布置的另一军事据点，是以乌汶为中心的东北部。乌汶有机场，是泰国东北部与曼谷间铁路的终点。湄公河对岸老挝人民解放军与法军作战的机枪声，乌汶府属边界上的县份可以听得很清楚。
    在美国指挥下，銮披汶政府于去年起即在东北部进行各种部署。去年八月，銮披汶政府迫令越南侨民集中居住于东北部的某些地方，不准分散，以便管理。去年十月驻乌汶府属哇磷县（县界隔湄公河即老挝国界）的泰军第六师扩充后，即进行测绘泰越边境山区详细地图，并进驻边境各要点。去年十二月初，泰美军事人员抵乌汶，与第六师开会，会商边境形势及配备使用新式武器等问题。此后，数名美籍教官即至该师训练使用新式武器并搜集谍报。
    泰国空军署同时也派专人至乌汶等地视察，拟修复日本占领时期所建的机场。
    美国第一批军火交给泰方后，其中一部分运交驻在哇磷的第六师。
    泰国警察方面也积极加强泰越边境实力。这些边境警察配备有火箭炮、重机枪、坦克、无线电通讯等设备。同时警方也在东北部探测及绘制各地山区形势。
    美国军事顾问团也准备到东北部去勘察情况。美国驻泰武官则拟在乌汶设立联络办事处。美泰双方在曼谷举办的间谍训练班已有两班特务分子毕业后派至东北部。美国帝国主义者指挥下的安息日会、浸信会、天主教等“传教士”，不断在东北部各地以及泰越边境上“旅行”。
    美国所谓专门经济技术团，美驻泰经济合作分署无线电话、电报专家，糖业专家，也都先后来东北部的乌汶、呵叻、廊开等地视察。
    法国驻泰武官也在一月间至乌汶，并经过泰越边境至法占区与法方人员会商。
    一月间，泰国报纸载，泰国高级参谋人员所透露的消息说：对越南作战计划，已经布置好了，美国命令一下，就可动手了！
    美国帝国主义者通过銮披汶反动政府在泰国进行的备战措施，使泰国人民日益觉醒。斯德哥尔摩和平宣言的签名，在各种阻挠下，人数已增至十万；反对干涉越南的呼声，日趋高涨。泰国人民是痛恨战争的。
                                          （二月二十日寄）
