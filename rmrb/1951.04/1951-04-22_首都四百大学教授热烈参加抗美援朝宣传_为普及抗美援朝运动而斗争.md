On a special express train from Beijing to Tianjin, the dim light and pervasive cigarette smoke, along with the rhythmic sound of the wheels, were lulling passengers to sleep. Suddenly, a vigorous voice rang out in the carriage: "We are a visiting group of teachers from Tsinghua University. During this spring break, we are visiting factories in Tianjin. We'll take this opportunity on the train to tell you about resisting America and aiding Korea..." This voice shook the entire carriage. People who had been lying down sat up, and closed eyes opened. Dozens of welcoming and surprised gazes gathered on a group of people in gray uniforms. The passengers listened to the anti-American and aid-Korea clatter talk while whispering to each other, "University professors are coming out to promote resisting America and aiding Korea!"

China has indeed changed greatly; university professors are also leaving the classroom. At the same time, in the coal mines of Mentougou, at the Daoji Hospital in Beijing, and in hundreds of villages in the suburbs of Beijing, four hundred professors were showing lantern slides to workers, discussing with doctors the issue of intellectuals eliminating pro-American, fear-of-American, and worship-of-American thoughts, and listening to farmers' accusations, which increased their own anti-American sentiments. In the early days of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement last year, most of them were still staying in their small world - the study, using the pen as the only weapon to attack American imperialism. Now, they have resolutely responded to the call of the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association and the Chinese Education Trade Union, and with the consciousness of the working class as masters, they are moving from the study to factories, mines, and rural areas, uniting with their class brothers to vigorously promote and push forward the patriotic movement of resisting America, aiding Korea, and opposing the American arming of Japan!

When professors went to the countryside to participate in land reform before the new year, they still had some "guest" mentality; but in this propaganda, they all appeared as masters. Professor Yu Zhenpeng of the Department of Political Science at Tsinghua University walked through the wind and sand on dark roads to the small team headquarters to discuss work. In order to prepare for an accusation meeting, Professor Zhang Longxiang of the Department of Chemistry at Peking University went to a remote natural village to collect information. After returning to the lodging place for discussion, he felt that there was another victim in that village who had to speak out. So he ran back to that village alone again. In order to prepare for a speech at a symposium of industrial and commercial circles, Professor Wang Zhuxi of the Department of Physics at Tsinghua University personally went to the tax bureau to understand ideological conditions. After returning, he discussed with everyone, and then looked for materials to write a lecture draft. Professor Jin Kemu of Peking University collected local materials and wrote and performed "Tears of Qingming" in two days, which was warmly welcomed by the farmers. In the fourteenth district, professors from the Peking University Medical College and the Union Medical College treated children suffering from measles and vaccinated them against smallpox while promoting resisting America and aiding Korea.

Professors who remained at the school were also playing their part on the propaganda front of resisting America and aiding Korea. Professor Hua Luogeng of Tsinghua University conducted propaganda in barbershops. Professor Huang Ziqing wrote sixteen letters of comfort with different content to the Chinese People's Volunteers. Professors Li Jixiang and Yan Renyin wrote letters to their friends and students abroad, urging them to return quickly to participate in the construction of the motherland.

As the director of the Tianjin Machine Factory said when welcoming the Tsinghua teachers' visiting group: "In the old society, except for a few rulers, no one was not oppressed. The reactionaries not only oppressed the proletariat, but also oppressed knowledgeable university professors." Professor Cao Guohui of Tsinghua University complained at the same meeting: "For more than forty years in the old society, I have been oppressed and deceived by the reactionaries, and I am very discouraged and numb about politics." After liberation, many of them still only looked at the changed world outside from books, and it always seemed like there was a layer between them and reality. Therefore, while Professor Cao Guohui saw a new country rising and resolutely sent his daughter to a military cadre school, he always thought that professional work and anti-American and aid-Korea political work were contradictory. It was not until he participated in the Tsinghua University teachers' visiting group and promoted resisting America and aiding Korea on trains, buses, trams, and in the factories he visited, that he was warmly welcomed without exception. At this time, the mess of contradictions stuck in his chest naturally dissolved in his own and the political enthusiasm that the masses gave him. "I paid a little time and energy, but I got more; only by improving political understanding can professional work be done better." This is the conclusion of Professor Cao and many professors who participated in this spring break propaganda. After going to the countryside, the professors of Peking University Medical College and Union Medical College more deeply realized the correctness of the central Ministry of Health's policy of "facing workers, peasants, and soldiers, and prioritizing prevention" and "training a large number of intermediate medical cadres," which can guarantee that they will play a more conscious role in the cause of medical education in the future.

Educators are also educated at the same time, which is particularly evident in political propaganda and education work. Professor Li Shoutong of the North China University of Technology saw the new atmosphere in the countryside - many farmers were busy preparing for spring plowing, and many farmers were happily repairing houses, which made him further recognize the power of the masses and increased his confidence in the construction of the new China. Professor Yu Zhenpeng of Tsinghua University met Grandpa Wang, a fisherman. Grandpa Wang could sing Lotus Falls, and Professor Yu immediately thought of buying a new songbook to send to him to carry out propaganda after returning to school. Professor Yu Ruihuang of the Department of Physics returned from propaganda at Daoji Hospital, and a sense of political responsibility prompted him to write letters to two doctors at the hospital, hoping that they would actively promote political study in the hospital. The professors of the Department of Geology at Peking University Medical College have formulated such a patriotic covenant: in the future, when going to the field for practice, they must often do political propaganda work.

### 首都四百大学教授热烈参加抗美援朝宣传  为普及抗美援朝运动而斗争

　　首都四百大学教授热烈参加抗美援朝宣传
　  为普及抗美援朝运动而斗争
    在一辆从北京开往天津去的特别快车上。昏黄的灯光，迷漫的烟气，和着有节奏的车轮声，正催着旅客蒙眬入睡。突然，一个苍劲的声音，在车厢中响了起来：“我们是清华大学教师参观团，这次春假到天津参观工厂，趁便在车上向诸位说说抗美援朝……。”这声音震动了全车厢，马上躺下的人坐了起来，闭着的眼睛睁了开来，几十双欢迎而惊讶的眼光，一齐聚集在那一堆穿着灰制服的人身上。旅客们一面听着抗美援朝快板，一面彼此低低传语着：“大学教授也出来宣传抗美援朝啦！”
    中国确是大变了，大学教授也走出课堂。同一时间内，在门头沟的煤矿底层，在北京的道济医院，在京郊几百个农村里，正有着四百位教授在为工人放映幻灯，和医师谈知识分子扫除亲美、恐美、崇美思想问题，在听着农民的控诉而激增了自己抗美的情绪。去年抗美援朝运动初期，他们大部分还只是停留在小天地——书房里，用笔作为唯一的打击美帝国主义的武器。现在，他们已经坚决响应中国人民抗美援朝总会和中国教育工会的号召，以工人阶级的主人翁的自觉态度，从书房走向工厂、矿山和农村，和阶级兄弟汇合在一起，大力宣传和推动抗美援朝反对美国武装日本的爱国运动了！
    在年前教授下乡参加土地改革时，多少还带着一些“作客”心理；但在这次宣传中，他们都已以主人翁的姿态出现了。清华大学政治系于振鹏教授在风沙中走黑路到小队部去讨论工作。为了准备一个控诉会，北京大学化学系张龙翔教授到一个很远的自然村搜集情况。回到住宿地讨论后，他觉得那个村还有一个苦主非出来讲话不可。于是他又一个人再跑回那村去。为了准备在一个工商界座谈会上的发言，清华大学物理系王竹溪教授便亲到税务局了解思想情况。回来后和大家一起讨论，然后找材料写讲演稿。北京大学金克木教授搜集了当地材料，在两天内编写演出了“清明泪”，受到农民热烈的欢迎。在十四区，北京大学医学院和协和医学院的教授，一面给农民的孩子治疗麻疹和种牛痘，一面宣传抗美援朝。
    留在学校的教授，在抗美援朝的宣传战线上，同样发挥着自己的一分力量。清华大学华罗庚教授在理发店里进行宣传。黄子卿教授给中国人民志愿军写了不同内容的十六封慰问信。李辑祥和严仁荫教授写信给他们在国外的朋友和学生，劝他们赶快回来参加祖国的建设。
    正如天津机器厂的厂长在欢迎清华教师参观团时所说：“在旧社会除了少数统治者以外，是没有不被压迫的。反动派不仅压迫无产阶级，也压迫有知识的大学教授。”清华大学的曹国惠教授，就在同一个会上诉苦：“在旧社会四十多年，一直受反动派的压迫欺蒙，对政治很灰心很麻痹。”解放以后，他们之中许多人，还只是从书本来看外面改变了的世界，总似乎隔了一层。因此，曹国惠教授一面也看到一个新的国家站起来了，坚决送女儿参加军事干部学校；一面又总认为业务和抗美援朝政治工作是有矛盾的。等到他这次参加了清华大学教师参观团，在列车上、在公共汽车、电车上，在参观的工厂中宣传抗美援朝后，无例外地受到热烈的欢迎。这时，那塞在他胸中一团乱麻似的矛盾，自然在他自己的、以及群众感染给他的政治热情中溶解了。“我付出了一点时间与精力，可是我得到的更多；只有提高了政治认识，业务才可以搞得更好。”这是曹教授也是这次参加春假宣传的许多教授的结论。北京大学医学院、协和医学院的教授们，下乡以后更深刻体会到中央卫生部“面向工农兵、预防为主”以及“大批培养中级医务干部”方针的正确性，这就可以保证他们今后在医学教育事业中将更自觉地发挥作用。
    教育者同时受教育，这在政治宣传教育工作中是特别显明的。华北大学工学院的李寿同教授看到农村的新气象——许多农民紧张地准备春耕，许多农民快乐地在修盖房屋，使他更进一步认识了群众的力量，增加了新中国建设的信心。清华大学的于振鹏教授结识了渔民王大爷。王大爷会唱莲花落，于教授立刻想到回校后要买新唱本送给他去进行宣传。物理系的余瑞璜教授从道济医院宣传回来，一种政治责任感推动着他写信给医院的两个医生，希望他们积极推动医院中的政治学习。北京大学医学院地质系的教授则订立了这样的爱国公约：今后到野外实习去，要经常做政治宣传工作。
