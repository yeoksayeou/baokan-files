　　The Pneumatic Drill Operators of Huainan Coal Mine
　  Fight to Learn Enterprise Management and Strengthen Trade Union Work!
    In the state-owned Huainan Coal Mine, many miners have become pneumatic drill operators mastering advanced techniques. When the new coal mining method was being tested, the mine leadership paid attention to training skilled workers. They assigned a group of young workers to pneumatic drill operators as coal shovelers. The trade union educated these coal shovelers to actively unite with the pneumatic drill operators and learn techniques from them. The Communist Party and Youth League branches also called on Party members and League members to take the lead in mastering advanced techniques. Technical personnel also went deep into the field to introduce Soviet experiences and correct the posture of holding the drill. This created a wave of technical learning throughout the mine. In order to promote new creations in work in a timely manner, the trade union further mobilized workers to establish technical study meetings before work and post-shift meeting systems. The Guoqing Brigade of Jiulonggang also established a technical guidance system, with each step of the working face as a unit, and technical personnel regularly provided guidance to fixed targets. As a result, within two months, ten apprentices in the brigade had mastered the techniques. In February of this year, the mine launched a new record-breaking movement in conjunction with the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. In the movement, the pneumatic drill operators further mastered the techniques, which continuously improved production efficiency. For example, the coal mining volume per pneumatic drill per shift in the Xinzhuangzi mine has generally increased from more than eight tons to more than 150 tons, and Li Daoping, Chen Yuhua, and others have exceeded 200 tons. Young pneumatic drill operator Chen Yuhua, due to constantly consulting with veteran workers and technical personnel, and striving to study techniques and improve operating methods, created a record of 215 tons of coal mined per shift per pneumatic drill on February 25th. Now, the number of workers in the entire Huainan Coal Mine who can master pneumatic drill technology has increased from the original 20 to nearly 100.
    In the process of continuous exploration and research, the pneumatic drill operators have gained considerable experience in how to operate pneumatic drills and manage the roof. Labor model pneumatic drill operator Feng Xuran, in using the stepped new mining method, suggested changing the original five stepped faces to two and a half, increasing the coal mining efficiency of the pneumatic drill by more than one and a half times, and making it safer. Their study of Soviet advanced methods such as improving labor organization and using coal seam cleavage and formation pressure for mining has been successful and is being promoted in the mine's fields implementing the new mining method.

　　淮南煤矿的风镐手
　  为学会企业管理和加强工会工作而斗争！
    国营淮南煤矿不少矿工，已成为掌握先进技术的风镐手。在新采煤法试验开始时，该矿领导方面就注意培养技术工人。他们曾把一批青年工人配备给风镐手作撩煤工。工会则教育这些撩煤工主动团结风镐手，向风镐手学习技术。共产党和青年团的支部也号召党团员带头掌握先进技术。技术人员也深入现场，介绍苏联经验，校正拿镐的姿势等。这样就在全矿造成了一个学习技术的热潮。为了及时推广工作中新的创造，工会又进一步发动工人建立了上班前的技术学习会，交班后的碰头会等制度。九龙岗国庆大队还建立了技术辅导制度，以工作面的每一个台阶为单位，由技术人员找固定对象经常辅导。因此不到两个月，该队就有十个学习工掌握了技术。今年二月，该矿又展开了与抗美援朝运动相结合的创造新纪录运动。在运动中风镐手们进一步地掌握了技术，使生产效率不断提高。如新庄子矿场每台风镐每班采煤量已由八吨多普遍提高到一百五十吨以上，其中李道平、陈玉华等四人并超过了二百吨。青年风镐手陈玉华，由于经常向老工人和技术人员请教，并努力钻研技术，改进操作方法，于二月二十五日创造了每班每台风镐采煤二百十五吨的最高纪录。现在淮南煤矿全矿能掌握风镐技术的工人，已由原来的二十人增加到近一百人。
    风镐手们在不断摸索钻研中，对怎样操纵风镐，管理顶板等技术作业已有了相当经验。劳动模范风镐手酆绪然，在使用台阶式新法采煤中，建议将原来的五个台阶面改为二个半，提高风镐采煤效能一倍半以上，并且还更加安全。他们学习苏联改进劳动组织、利用煤层的壁裂性和地层压力采煤等先进方法，已得到成功，并在全矿实行新采煤法的场子里推广。
