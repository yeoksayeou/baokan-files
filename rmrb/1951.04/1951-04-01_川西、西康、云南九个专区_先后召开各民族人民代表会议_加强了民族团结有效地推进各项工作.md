　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd. Nine special districts in Southwest China, including Maoxian in Western Sichuan, Kangding and Xichang in Xikang Province, and Lijiang, Baoshan, Ning'er (i.e., Puer), Wuding, Zhaotong, and Mengzi in Yunnan Province, have successively convened people's representative conferences of various nationalities. More than 3,400 representatives from various nationalities attended the conferences, including Han, Tibetan, Hui, Yi, Miao, Bo, Woni, Minjia, Mosuo, Lisu, Guzong, Zhongjia, Lemo, Akha, Kawa, Shantai, Achang, Benglong, Nu, Sharen, Yao, Qiang, Nongren, and Qiu people, as well as people from all walks of life who believe in Lamaism, Islam, and Christianity, and Tusi, mountain officials, and headmen. Some of these representatives came from the Greater and Lesser Liangshan Mountains on the border of Sichuan and Xikang, the snow-capped mountains and grasslands of northwestern Sichuan, and the remote Nushan Mountains, Gaoligong Mountains, and Kawa Mountains in western, northwestern, and southern Yunnan Province. Before liberation, the people of these nationalities never dared to leave the deep mountains and jungles because of the oppression of the Kuomintang.

　　The People's Representative Conferences of Various Nationalities in each special district focused on discussing how to further strengthen national unity and eliminate bandits and special agents. The responsible persons of the local people's governments and the Communist Party of China made reports on national policies and national work in accordance with the spirit of the Common Program. In the discussions, representatives of various nationalities painfully accused the Kuomintang bandit gangs of provoking national relations and creating national hatred. They expressed their sincere support for the national policy in the Common Program and the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Communist Party. At these meetings, representatives of various nationalities signed unity pacts, automatically eliminating years of disputes and estrangement between and within various nationalities. The Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government was established in the Tibetan-inhabited area east of the Jinsha River in Xikang Province. The All-Circles Consultative Committees of All Ethnic Groups were established in Xichang and Baoshan.

　　The People's Representative Conferences of Various Nationalities in each special district also held detailed discussions on the issues of production and trade, culture and education, medical and health care, and training cadres of various nationalities to participate in political power construction. Xichang, Wuding and other special districts also discussed the gradual implementation of social reforms such as rent reduction in ethnic mixed areas when conditions are ripe.

　　Through these conferences, the political consciousness of the people of all nationalities has been greatly improved. They sent their children to various schools and training courses to study, and assisted the people's government in capturing hidden bandits and special agents. In the vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea across the country, people of all nationalities held symposiums and parades. They have repeatedly assured that they will participate in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea with practical actions. In many telegrams to Chairman Mao and the Chinese People's Volunteers, they expressed their love for the motherland and their hatred for U.S. imperialism. Some Tibetan and Hui youths in Kangding wrote to the Xikang Daily, expressing their desire to go to Korea to join the Volunteers to resist the American aggressors. Christians among the Lisu nationality in Lijiang and the Hui and Yi nationalities in Wuding responded to the religious reform movement, expressing their determination to sever the relationship between religion and imperialism. The people of the Bo nationality in Baoshan and the Tibetan, Hui, Yi, and Qiang nationalities in Maoxian used their personal experiences to accuse the Japanese invaders of their massacres and bombings, expressing their firm opposition to the United States arming Japan.

　　Local experiences have proved that convening people's representative conferences of various nationalities is one of the most effective methods to unite the people of all nationalities and promote work. At the same time, due to the convening of people's representative conferences of various nationalities in various places, the policy level of cadres has been greatly improved, and their relationship with the people of various nationalities has become more harmonious. Therefore, the Southwest Nationalities Affairs Commission has instructed all localities to widely convene people's representative conferences of various nationalities in the future, so as to understand the needs of the people of various nationalities through the conferences and solicit their opinions on various tasks, so that the people's government can better help them develop political, economic, cultural and other undertakings.

　　川西、西康、云南九个专区       
    先后召开各民族人民代表会议       
    加强了民族团结有效地推进各项工作
    【新华社重庆二十三日电】西南地区已有川西茂县、西康省康定、西昌和云南省丽江、保山、宁洱（即普洱）、武定、昭通、蒙自等九个专区，先后召开了各民族人民代表会议。出席会议的有汉族、藏族、回族、彝族、苗族、僰族、窝尼族、民家族、摩些族、傈僳族、古宗族、仲家族、倮?族、阿卡族、卡瓦族、山头族、阿昌族、崩龙族、怒族、沙人族、傜族、羌族、侬人族、俅人族等数十种民族，包括信仰喇嘛教、回教、基督教的各界人民代表以及土司、山官、头人等三千四百余人。这些代表有的来自川康边境的大小凉山、川西北的雪山草地、云南省西部、西北部和南部边远的怒山、高黎贡山、卡瓦山。这些民族的人民，在解放前因受国民党的压迫，从不敢走出深山丛林。
    各专区的各民族人民代表会议，都着重地讨论了如何进一步加强民族团结、肃清土匪特务等问题。各地人民政府及中国共产党的负责人都根据共同纲领的精神，作了民族政策及民族工作的报告。各民族代表在讨论中，沉痛地控诉了过去国民党匪帮挑拨民族关系，制造民族仇恨的罪行。他们对共同纲领中的民族政策，对毛主席、中央人民政府和共产党的英明领导，都表示竭诚拥护。在这些会议上，各民族代表都订立了团结公约，自动消除各民族之间或各民族内部多年来的纠纷和隔阂。西康省金沙江以东的藏民聚居地区，并成立了藏族自治区人民政府。西昌和保山均成立了各族各界协商委员会。
    各专区的各民族人民代表会议，对各民族人民的生产贸易、文化教育、医药卫生以及培养各民族干部参加政权建设等问题，也都作了详细的讨论。西昌、武定等专区并讨论了在条件成熟的民族杂居地区，逐步实行减租等社会改革工作。
    通过这些会议，各民族人民政治觉悟大大提高。他们把子弟送入各种学校和训练班学习，并协助人民政府捕获暗藏的土匪特务。在全国蓬勃展开的抗美援朝运动中，各民族人民普遍举行了座谈会和游行示威。他们都一再保证，要以实际行动参加抗美援朝运动。他们在给毛主席和我国人民志愿军的许多电文中，都表示了他们热爱祖国及仇恨美帝国主义的心情。康定有些藏族和回族的青年，并写信给西康日报，表示要去朝鲜参加志愿军抗击美国侵略者。丽江傈僳族、武定回族、彝族中的基督教徒，都响应宗教革新运动，表示要坚决割断宗教与帝国主义的关系。保山的僰族和茂县的藏族、回族、彝族、羌族等民族人民，都以亲身的遭遇，控诉了日寇屠杀和轰炸的暴行，表示坚决反对美国武装日本。
    各地的经验证明：召开各民族人民代表会议，是团结各民族人民和推进工作最有效的方法之一。同时由于各地召开了各民族人民代表会议，干部的政策水平有很大的提高，他们和各民族人民的关系更加融洽。因此，西南民族事务委员会曾指示各地，今后应广泛召开各民族人民代表会议，通过会议来了解各民族人民的需要，征求他们对各项工作的意见，以便人民政府能更好地帮助他们发展政治、经济、文化等事业。
