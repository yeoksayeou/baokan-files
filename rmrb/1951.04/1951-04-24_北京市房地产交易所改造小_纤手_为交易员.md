    Beijing Real Estate Exchange Transforms Petty "Brokers" into Traders
    Editor:
    In order to implement the resolutions of the Third Session of the First Beijing Municipal People's Congress and solve the housing problems of the general public, the Beijing Municipal Land Administration Bureau's Real Estate Exchange, after petitioning the Municipal People's Government to ban "real estate broker" activities, worked with district offices and police stations to select thirty former petty "brokers" from working-class backgrounds who were relatively upright in their conduct, possessed a certain degree of work ability, and were willing to serve the people, to serve as traders for the exchange. The traders' compensation is based on a profit-sharing system. In order to reform them, promote their enthusiasm, and enable them to better serve the people, the Real Estate Exchange has specifically stipulated five rules of conduct: 1. Obey leadership and strictly abide by government policies and regulations. 2. Work conscientiously and responsibly, and do not engage in embezzlement or malpractice. 3. Actively serve the people and do not engage in other occupations concurrently. 4. Report illegal "real estate broker" transactions and do not condone or indulge them. 5. Treat citizens with kindness and sincerity.
    Now, these real estate transaction workers have begun their work and hope that the public will supervise and educate them.
