　　Standing on the Frontline of Resisting Aggression and Defending Peace
　  (Radio speech delivered on April 23, 1951, on the Central People's Broadcasting Station)
    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea
    Compatriots across the country!
    The aggressor armies of the American imperialists and their vassal states have suffered惨重的惨重的 failures in the war of aggression against Korea. Since last October, when our brave Chinese People's Volunteer Army supported Korea and fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, until today, nearly 130,000 enemies have been wiped out, among which the American invading army accounts for the major part. American imperialism has already thrown two-thirds of its ground forces onto the Korean battlefield. What awaits them? Without a doubt, it is complete annihilation!
    However, American imperialism has not learned the lesson it deserved from this terrible failure. In order to cover up the failure and ease the internal contradictions of the aggressive bloc, the US government dismissed the notorious war criminal MacArthur on April 11, but immediately replaced him with Ridgway, the commander of the Eighth Army invading Korea. Moreover, on the same day that MacArthur was dismissed, the American invaders brazenly sent more than 200 planes to invade the airspace along the coast of our Fujian Province, and strafed our peaceful residents in Fuzhou City. The day after MacArthur was dismissed, the American invaders again sent more than 70 planes to bomb Dandong City and its suburbs. This proves that the American robbers not only have no intention of repenting, but are even further extending their aggressive claws and expanding their killing range.
    The American imperialists are painstakingly trying to conquer the whole world, wanting to suck the blood of people all over the world to fatten a few greedy capitalists. Its policy of aggression against the world is to advance simultaneously from Western Europe and East Asia. At the end of last year, it sent the famous war-monger Eisenhower to Western Europe, wanting to organize a million-strong joint army of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, especially to support West Germany, prepare for a separate peace with West Germany, and rearm West Germany. In January of this year, it sent another famous war-monger, Dulles, to Tokyo, Japan, to prepare for a separate peace with Japan and rearm Japan. Although the people of countries in the East and West, including the people of West Germany and Japan, are vehemently opposed, at present it has not made the American aggressors restrain their ambitions.
    Eisenhower, who is preparing to be the commander of the North Atlantic Allied Forces—the future MacArthur of Europe—has now arrived in Europe again. Dulles will also go to Tokyo again in the near future. This also proves that the American aggressors want to use the remnants of the fascist elements of West Germany and Japan to scrape together a large number of cannon fodder, and the mad plan to re-launch a world war is being stepped up.
    Compatriots, this is the current international situation.
    Under such a situation, we Chinese people are standing on the frontline of resisting aggression and defending peace. What should we do?
    Without a doubt, we should further strengthen our sacred patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea. We must make this movement more popular, more in-depth, and more lasting.
    On March 14, the China Peace Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea had already issued a notice to the whole country to popularize and deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea. We hope that all compatriots across the country will earnestly implement the five suggestions put forward in that notice, one by one, "so that everyone in every place in the country can receive this patriotic education and actively participate in this patriotic action."
    Compatriots, we have already won glorious and great victories on the Korean front. The enemy's internal divisions have already begun. The enemy has lost the confidence of quickly conquering all of Korea. Even Ridgway, the commander of the invaders, had to publicly admit in a conversation with reporters on April 1, "The war is facing a huge crisis, and the war is becoming more and more difficult for the United States."
    This is the aggressors' undeniable sorrow. Let them be thoroughly sad! We must make the "huge crisis" foreseen by the invaders arrive quickly, continuously, and increasingly "huge," and make the invaders "more and more difficult" until they all roll out of Korea! Roll out of Taiwan! Roll out of Asia!
    The glorious victory of the Chinese and Korean people has made a great contribution to the defense of world peace. We have set a lofty moral example for the world, a lofty example of international friendship. We have not only struck at the arrogant arrogance of the invaders, but also encouraged the confidence of all peace-loving people in the world.
    Compatriots, let us continue our efforts! Without mercy, without relaxation, without giving the enemy a chance to breathe. Our goal is the complete liberation of Korea, the complete liberation of Taiwan, and the complete elimination of all imperialist aggressive forces.
    We must do everything that is beneficial to the country and to the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, do our best to persuade others to do it, and make everyone do it well. We will absolutely not do anything that is detrimental to the country and to resisting America and aiding Korea, and we will never allow anyone to do it. Today, we must relentlessly suppress heartless traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and treasonous elements. We must make all the people of China become patriotic heroes, and make all physical and mental laborers become labor models.
    Compatriots, our patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea is inseparable from the international movement to defend world peace. The March 14 notice has already made it very clear: "In the movement to resist America and aid Korea, we should link it to responding to the resolution of the World Peace Council, opposing the arming of Japan, and defending world peace." We "should denounce the crimes of Japanese and American aggression and the crimes of Japanese and American running dogs, Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and secret agents persecuting the people, hold a signing campaign to support the conclusion of a peace pact, and hold a vote on the Japanese issue."
    "On May 1, the people in urban and rural areas across the country should hold large-scale demonstrations as universally as possible, with resisting America and aiding Korea, opposing the arming of Japan, and defending world peace as the main content of the demonstrations, to promote the anti-American and aid-Korea movement of the people of the whole country to a further step."
    May 1, the great festival of solidarity and struggle of the working people of the world, is approaching. We are a country that practices people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the working class, and we are the people standing on the front line of resisting American aggression and defending world peace. Our preparations for the grand demonstration should be stepped up. We must demonstrate the determination and spirit of the Chinese people in the "signing in support of the conclusion of a peace pact" and "holding a vote on the Japanese issue." We must strive to get the largest number of compatriots to sign and vote, even if we can't get the integer of 475 million, let's take 300 million as the standard! Strive for 300 million signatures or votes, or break through 300 million!
    Regarding the method of signing or voting, the April 5 notice of the Anti-American and Aid Korea General Association also stated very clearly that we can "use the method of raising hands to replace it." Please strive for 300 million people to raise their hands! Or break through 300 million!
    Amidst the unprecedented patriotic upsurge of the anti-American and aid-Korea movement, we believe that it is possible to achieve such a number. Expressing the determination and spirit of the Chinese people in this way can not only strike at the enemy's conspiracy, but also encourage the fighting spirit of peace comrades all over the world.
    Why do we ask the five major powers—China, the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France—to conclude a peace pact? Perhaps it is still necessary to explain this today. Perhaps there are still many people who have such questions: In the current international situation where the opposition between aggressive forces and peaceful forces is so sharp, is it possible for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact? Since China has resolutely resisted the United States and aided Korea, and has been fighting a life-and-death struggle with the aggressive bloc on the battlefield, why is it still necessary to conclude a peace pact with the United States, Britain, and France? The aggressors have already torn up all the existing international agreements. Even if a peace pact is concluded, what is the use?
    We should answer these questions. But in answering these questions, we should first carefully study the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact.
    This is a very simple and powerful declaration, and its intention is very clear.
    The people of the whole world need peace, and only a few war-mongers need war. But these few war-mongers often deceive the people of the whole world, saying that they are also defending peace, and that their expansion of armaments, preparation for war, and even waging war are to prevent aggression. Who is invading? Who is the aggressor? They say: It is the Soviet Union, it is our People's Republic of China. They are constantly deceiving the people of the world in such a shameless and stubborn way, trying to blind the people of the world and drag them into a new war. For the sake of the defense of world peace, we should expose this deception and let the people of the world know who the real aggressors are.
    The conclusion of this peace pact is a touchstone for exposing deception.
    We know that the Soviet Union is a country that has consistently adhered to a policy of peace. The Soviet government has twice proposed the conclusion of a peace pact in the United Nations, but both times it was rejected. Therefore, the Soviet government will naturally not refuse the request for the conclusion of a peace pact.
    Since the founding of our People's Republic of China, we have established a national policy of peace and construction. It was American imperialism that hindered us, and we were forced to launch the movement to resist America and aid Korea. Our patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea is actually a movement to defend Asian peace and defend world peace. We have consistently advocated resolving the Korean issue in a peaceful manner. The Korean issue does not allow interference from external forces, and should be resolved by the Korean people themselves. Therefore, our Central People's Government will never refuse the request for the conclusion of a peace pact.
    Then, the question is left to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France. They often hypocritically wave the banner of peace and slander our China and the Soviet Union as aggressors. Well, we now propose to them the request to conclude a peace pact. Let's see if they refuse or not!
    If they do not refuse, then they should immediately stop all cold wars and hot wars, all war cries, all military preparations, and everyone should compete peacefully. That is the happiness of the people of the world!
    If any of them refuses, wouldn't that "prove that it has a conspiracy of aggression" and expose this "conspiracy" simply and directly in front of the people of the world?
    Exposing the enemy’s lies in this way is to undermine the enemy's foundation. If the people are less deceived, the invaders will not be able to scrape together large amounts of military spending and cannon fodder. If the military spending and cannon fodder of the aggressive camp decrease by one point, the vital force of the peace camp will increase by one point.
    This is the real intention of asking the five major powers to conclude a peace pact today.
    Therefore, in our view, it would be good if a peace pact could be concluded. If it cannot be concluded, it can further promote the expansion and consolidation of the peace camp. Is it absolutely impossible to conclude? Is it useless even if it is concluded? No! The initiative is in the hands of our people. As long as our anti-American and aid-Korea movement is more popular and in-depth, and we strike the enemy more severely, as long as our peace camp is more expanded and consolidated, so that the enemy will retreat in the face of difficulties and restrain its aggressive ambitions, then the peace pact can be concluded successfully, and it can be guaranteed. This is the so-called "winning without fighting, the best of war." We are not a war-loving aggressive country. Being able to rely on the strength of the peace camp to eliminate the Third World War and reduce human sacrifice is exactly what we should strive for!
    Compatriots, I don't think it is necessary to say more about the vote on the Japanese issue. The goals of our vote, as the April 5 notice has made very clear, are nothing more than these two items:
    "(1) Oppose the United States arming Japan and oppose the United States making a separate peace with Japan.
    (2) Advocate the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan to promote the peace and democracy of the Japanese people."
    Our "opposition" and our "advocacy" are all fair and selfless. We are not only thinking for ourselves, but also thinking for the Japanese people, for the Asian people, and for the people of the whole world.
    American imperialism wants to step up the arming of Japan, wants to make a separate peace with Japan, and exclude China and the Soviet Union from participating. It just wants to colonize Japan, wants to make Japan a base for aggressive war, and wants to use the Japanese people as cannon fodder for aggressive war. Not only do we Chinese people oppose this, Asian people oppose this, and people all over the world oppose this, but the Japanese people are also doing their best to oppose this.
    In the war to defeat Japanese imperialism, we Chinese people fought the longest and sacrificed the most. In the war to defeat Japanese imperialism, the military strength of the Soviet Union played a decisive role. If a peace treaty with Japan excludes China and the Soviet Union from participating, that is just a signal of aggressive war. We Chinese people will absolutely not allow this, and the people of the whole world, including the Japanese people, will absolutely not allow this.
    Our vote can specifically express the power of justice, can encourage the struggle of the Japanese people, guarantee that the Japanese people get peace and democracy, and make the imperialist aggressive group fear and dare not act recklessly and arbitrarily.
    Compatriots, the vote on the peaceful resolution of the German issue in Western Europe is already actively underway. According to estimates by Brichet, the deputy prime minister of the Bonn puppet government, 99 percent of the people in West Germany oppose the arming of West Germany. The opposition of the West German people has made the war-monger Eisenhower feel thorny. We cannot sit idly by in the East. We must make the war-mongers such as Dulles and Ridgway feel equally thorny.
    Compatriots, justice belongs to us. As long as we strengthen unity at home, strengthen the anti-American and aid-Korea movement, strengthen unity internationally, and strengthen the struggle to defend peace, there is no doubt that the final victory will also belong to us.

　　站在反抗侵略、保卫和平的最前线
　  （一九五一年四月二十三日在中央人民广播电台发表的广播演讲）
    中国人民抗美援朝总会主席　郭沫若全国的同胞们！
    美帝国主义者和它的仆从国家的侵略军，在侵略朝鲜战争中是遭受到惨重的失败的。自从去年十月我们英勇的中国人民志愿部队支援朝鲜，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战以来，直到今天为止，已经歼灭了敌人将近十三万人，在这里面美国的侵略军队是占主要的部分。美国帝国主义已经把它地面部队的三分之二投上了朝鲜战场。等待着他们的命运是什么呢？毫无疑问，是全部歼灭！
    然而美帝国主义从这惨重的失败中并没有得到应有的教训。美国政府为了掩饰失败，为了缓和一下侵略集团内部的矛盾，在四月十一日把臭名昭著的战争罪犯麦克阿瑟免了职，但立即把侵略朝鲜的第八军军长李奇微代替了他。而且在麦克阿瑟被撤职的同一天，美国侵略者竟以二百多架飞机，侵入我福建省沿海的领空，并在福州市扫射我们的和平居民。在麦克阿瑟被撤职的第二天，美国侵略者又派遣了七十多架飞机，轰炸我安东市和市外的郊区。这就证明，美国强盗不仅没有悔祸的心事，反而是更加伸长了它的侵略的魔手，扩大了它的杀人的范围。
    美帝国主义的处心积虑是要征服全世界，想吮吸全世界人民的血来养肥少数贪婪的大资本家。它的侵略世界的政策，是想从西欧和东亚同时并进。去年年底它曾经派遣了著名的战争贩子艾森豪威尔到西欧，想组织一百万人以上的北大西洋公约国的联军，特别是扶植西德，准备与西德片面媾和，重新武装西德。今年一月它又派遣了另一著名的战争贩子杜勒斯到过日本东京，准备与日本片面媾和，重新武装日本。尽管东西各国的人民，包括西德和日本的人民在内，都激烈地反对，但在目前还没有使得美国侵略者收敛它的野心。
    准备做北大西洋联军统帅的艾森豪威尔——未来的欧洲的麦克阿瑟，现在已经又到了欧洲。杜勒斯在最近也要再到东京去了。这也证明，美国侵略者想利用西德和日本的法西斯分子的残余，搜括大量的炮灰，重新卷起一次世界大战的狂妄计划，正在加紧地进行着。
    同胞们，这就是最近目前的国际形势。
    处在这样的形势之下，我们中国人民是站在反抗侵略、保卫和平的最前线的，我们应该怎样努力呢？
    毫无疑问，我们是应该更加加强我们的抗美援朝的神圣的爱国运动，我们要把这一运动更加普及，更加深入，更加持久。
    三月十四日中国人民抗美援朝总会早就向全国发出了普及深入抗美援朝运动的通告。我们希望全国同胞们照着那通告中所提出的五项建议，一项一项地切实地执行起来，“务使全国每一处每一人都受到这个爱国教育，都能积极参加这个爱国行动。”
    同胞们，我们在朝鲜前线上是已经获得了辉煌的伟大的胜利的。敌人的内部已经开始着分崩离析。敌人已经失掉了速战速决，征服全朝鲜的信心。就连侵略者的统帅李奇微，在四月一日对新闻记者的谈话里面也不得不公开承认：“战争存在着巨大危机，战争对美国越发艰苦。”
    这是侵略者无可掩饰的悲哀。让它们彻底地悲哀下去吧！我们要使侵略者所预感着的“巨大危机”，迅速地，连续不断地，愈来愈“巨大”地到来，而使侵略者“越发艰苦”到全部滚出朝鲜！全部滚出台湾！全部滚出亚洲！
    中朝人民的辉煌胜利，对于世界和平的保卫是有着伟大的贡献的。我们为全世界树立了崇高的道义的模范，崇高的国际友爱的模范。我们不仅打击了侵略者的狂妄的气焰，同时更鼓励了全世界爱好和平的人们胜利的信心。
    同胞们，我们再接再厉吧！毫不容情，毫不松懈，毫不让敌人有喘息的余地。我们的目标在朝鲜的彻底解放，台湾的彻底解放，一切帝国主义侵略势力的彻底肃清。
    凡是有利于国家，有利于抗美援朝的工作，我们什么都要做，都要尽力的做，尽力的劝人做，而且要大家都做得很好。凡是不利于国家，不利于抗美援朝的任何事情，我们都绝对不做，而且决不许任何人做。在今天，没有心肝的汉奸、特务、反革命分子、卖国分子，我们一定要加以无情的镇压。我们要使全中国的人都成为爱国的英雄，使全体的体力劳动者和脑力劳动者都成为劳动模范。
    同胞们，我们的抗美援朝的爱国运动，和保卫世界和平的国际运动是分不开的。三月十四日的通告已经说得很清楚：我们“在抗美援朝运动中，应当联系到响应世界和平理事会决议，反对武装日本，保卫世界和平。”我们“应当控诉日美侵略的罪行以及日美走狗蒋匪特务迫害人民的罪行，举行拥护缔结和平公约的签名，举行日本问题的投票。”
    “在五月一日，全国城乡人民尽可能普遍举行大示威，以抗美援朝、反对武装日本、保卫世界和平为示威的主要内容，推动全国人民抗美援朝运动更进一步。”
    五月一日，这个全世界劳动人民团结战斗的伟大节日已经迫近了。我们是以工人阶级为领导的实行人民民主专政的国家，我们是站在反抗美国侵略、保卫世界和平最前线的人民，我们的大示威准备，应该特别加紧了。我们要在“举行拥护缔结和平公约的签名”上，“举行日本问题的投票”上，轰轰烈烈地表现出我们中国人民的决心，我们中国人民的气魄。我们一定要争取最大多数的同胞来签名、投票，即使我们得不到四亿七千五百万的整数，我们请拿三万万人来做标准吧！争取三万万人的签名或投票，或者突破三万万！
    关于签名或投票的方式，四月五日抗美援朝总会的通知上也说得很清楚，我们可以“用举手办法代替”。我们请争取三万万人举手吧！或者突破三万万！
    在抗美援朝运动空前未有的爱国高潮当中，争取这样的数目，我们相信是可以办到的。这样来表现出我们中国人民的决心和气魄，不仅可以打击敌人的阴谋，而且可以鼓励全世界和平战友的斗志。
    我们为什么要求五大国—中、苏、英、美、法—来缔结和平公约呢？这在今天或许还有加以说明的必要。在今天或许还有不少的人怀抱着这样的疑问：侵略势力与和平力量的对立这样尖锐化的国际情势之下，五大国有缔结和平公约的可能吗？我们中国既已坚决地抗美援朝，和侵略集团已经在战场上作生死的斗争，为什么还有必要，要同美国、英国、法国缔结和平公约？侵略者已经把一切既成的国际协定都撕毁了，和平公约即使缔结了，又有什么用？
    我们应该来解答这些问题。但在解答这些问题上，我们最好是把世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言，仔细地研究一遍吧。
    这是很简单，很有力的一个宣言，它的用意，是很明显的。
    全世界的人民都需要和平，只有少数的战争贩子们需要战争。但这少数的战争贩子们却经常欺骗着全世界的人民，说他们也在保卫和平，说他们的扩充军备、准备战争乃至进行战争是在防止侵略。谁在侵略？谁是侵略者呢？他们说：是苏联、是我们中华人民共和国。这样无耻到万分地而且执拗到万分地不断地欺骗着全世界的人民，想把世界人民蒙蔽着，把他们拖进新的战争里面去。我们为了世界和平的保卫，便应该把这欺骗揭穿，让世界人民知道究竟谁是真正的侵略者。
    这和平公约的缔结就是一个揭穿欺骗的考金石。
    我们知道，苏联是一贯坚持和平政策的国家。苏联政府在联合国曾经前后两次提出过缔结和平公约的建议，都遭到了否决。因而苏联政府对于和平公约的缔结要求自然是不会拒绝的。
    我们中华人民共和国自从建国以来，即建立了和平建设的国策。是美帝国主义阻挠我们，我们被迫而发动了抗美援朝的运动。我们的抗美援朝的爱国运动，实际上也就是保卫亚洲和平保卫世界和平的运动。对于朝鲜问题，我们是一贯地主张以和平的方式来解决的。朝鲜问题，不容许外来力量的干涉，该由朝鲜人民自己解决。因此，我们的中央人民政府对于和平公约的缔结要求也是绝对不会拒绝的。
    那吗，问题就剩下美国，英国，法国的那几个国家的政府了。它们经常假仁假义的打着和平的幌子，并且诬蔑我们中苏两国为侵略者，那吗好，我们现在向它们提出缔结和平公约的要求。看它们拒绝不拒绝！
    假使它们不拒绝，那就应该立即停止一切的冷战热战，一切的战争叫嚣，一切的军事准备，大家和平竞赛，那是世界人民的幸福！
    假使它们之中任何一个政府要拒绝，那不就“证明它有侵略的阴谋”，而且把这“阴谋”简捷了当地暴露在全世界人民的面前了吗？
    这样来揭破侵略集团的弥天大谎，这样来挖空敌人的脚根。人民大众少受欺骗，侵略者便不能够如意地搜括大量的军费和炮灰。侵略阵营的军费和炮灰减少一分，和平阵营的有生力量就增加一分。
    这就是今天要求五大强缔结和平公约的真正的用意。
    所以，在我们看来，和平公约能缔结固然是很好，不能缔结那也就更可以促进和平阵营的扩大和巩固。是不是绝对不能缔结呢？是不是缔结了毫无用处呢？不！那主动权是在我们人民的手里。只要我们的抗美援朝的运动更加普及，更加深入，我们更加沉重地打击敌人，只要我们的和平阵营更加扩大，更加巩固，使敌人知难而退，收敛了它的侵略野心，那吗，和平公约是可以缔结成功的，而且可以有保障的。这就是所谓“不战而胜，战之上者”。我们并不是好战的侵略国家，能够靠着和平阵营的壮大，使第三次大战消弭于未然，减少人类的牺牲，那正是我们所应当努力的事！
    同胞们，关于日本问题的投票，我想是用不着多说了。我们投票的目标，四月五日的通知已经说得很清楚，不外是这两项：
    “（一）反对美国武装日本，反对美国单独对日媾和。
    （二）主张签订全面的对日和约，促进日本人民的和平、民主。”
    我们的“反对”，我们的“主张”，都是大公无私的。我们不单是在为我们自己着想，同时也在为日本人民着想，为亚洲人民着想，为全世界人民着想。
    美帝国主义要加紧武装日本，想和日本片面媾和，排除中国和苏联的参加，那只是想把日本殖民地化，想把日本作为侵略战争的基地，想把日本人民作为侵略战争的炮灰。这不仅我们中国人民反对，亚洲人民反对，全世界的人民反对，就是日本人民也在尽力地反对。
    在打败日本帝国主义的战争中，我们中国人民作战最久、牺牲最大。在打败日本帝国主义的战争中，苏联的军事力量是起了决定的作用的。对日和约如要排除中国和苏联参加，那只是侵略战争的信号。我们中国人民是绝对不能允许的，全世界的人民，包括日本人民在内，也是绝对不能允许的。
    我们的投票可以具体地表示正义的威力，可以鼓励日本人民的斗争，保障日本人民得到和平与民主，而使帝国主义侵略集团有所畏，而不敢一意孤行的轻举妄动。
    同胞们，在欧洲西部关于和平解决德国问题的投票，已经在积极的进行着了。单是西德人民，据波恩傀儡政府的副总理布里契的估计，反对武装西德的人数要占百分之九十九。西德人民的反对已使得战争贩子艾森豪威尔感觉着棘手了。在东方我们不能隔岸观火，我们一定要使得杜勒斯、李奇微那些战争贩子们也同样感觉着棘手。
    同胞们，正义是属于我们的。只要我们在国内加强团结，加强抗美援朝的运动，在国际也加强团结，加强保卫和平的斗争，毫无疑问，最后的胜利也一定是属于我们的。
