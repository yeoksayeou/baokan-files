To commemorate the first anniversary of the establishment of the China Changchun Railway Company, the Supervisory Board of the China Changchun Railway Company, the China Changchun Railway Bureau, and the China Railway Union's Central-Changchun Regional Committee held a celebration meeting in Harbin on the 25th. Attendees included Yu Guangsheng, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the China Changchun Railway Company, Vice Chairman Yelogov, advanced workers, model laborers, and employee representatives from the bureau, totaling over a thousand people. Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways of the Central People's Government, and Zhu Lizhi, Deputy Director of the Northeast People's Government's Finance and Economics Committee, also attended. On the stage hung portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Marshal Stalin, leaders of the Chinese and Soviet people. The front of the stage displayed a large banner with Chairman Mao's inscription: "I hope that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people will be greatly consolidated and developed." On both sides were congratulatory banners from the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, the Political Department of the Ministry of Railways, and the National Committee of the China Railway Union. The celebration meeting began at 2 PM. Yelogov, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of the China Changchun Railway Company, first suggested to the meeting that Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong be elected as Honorary Presidium of the meeting. All attendees stood up and applauded in agreement. Yu Guangsheng, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the China Changchun Railway Company, reported to the meeting on the great achievements made by the Central-Changchun Railway in the past year under the correct leadership of the Chinese and Soviet governments. Minister Teng Daiyuan and Vice Chairman Yelogov then gave speeches. In his speech, Minister Teng praised the achievements made by the Central-Changchun Railway in the past year with the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts and the efforts of all employees. He encouraged the entire bureau to continue its efforts, learn from Soviet advanced experience, and achieve even greater successes.

Furthermore, the China Changchun Railway Administration has achieved remarkable results due to the correct leadership of the Chinese and Soviet governments, the close cooperation of Chinese and Soviet employees, and the enthusiastic and friendly assistance and guidance of Soviet experts.

Since the bureau began independent work in May last year, it has gradually absorbed Soviet advanced experience, established organizations, verified staffing levels, formulated production and financial plans, cleared working capital, systematically promoted advanced Soviet railway working methods, and strengthened financial statistics work, all under the guidance of the principle of implementing the economic accounting system. As a result, great progress has been made in the bureau's operation and management. This is reflected in the promotion of a series of advanced working methods: After the launch of the 500-kilometer movement, locomotive utilization efficiency was improved. The number of 500-kilometer locomotive round trips increased by 57% in March this year compared to July last year. The number of locomotives participating in the 500-kilometer movement increased sixfold. Due to the promotion of locomotive boiler water softening, the locomotive wash-check mileage was generally extended from 3,000 kilometers to 4,000-4,500 kilometers, thereby reducing the use of defective locomotives. According to the calculations of the Locomotive Department of the China Changchun Railway Bureau, the failure rate of locomotives undergoing sectional repairs alone has decreased from 19.1% in May last year to 9.3% in March this year. Along with the implementation of the new inspection and repair methods, the wash-check dwell time has also been reduced from 41.5 hours to 20.3 hours. Under the guidance of Soviet advanced experience, locomotive accidents have been greatly reduced. Currently, locomotives with a safe operating distance of over 100,000 kilometers account for 30% of all operating locomotives.

In order to reduce waste in engineering construction, the bureau systematically reviewed the list of new construction projects in August last year, rectified the design budget work, established a certain engineering acceptance system, promoted new seasonal track maintenance methods and preventive plans and repair methods for large buildings, improved the efficiency of track maintenance, and overfulfilled the track repair plan. From May to December last year, 108% of the maintenance plan was completed, and 166% was completed in the first quarter of this year. The quality of the global line is good, accounting for more than 80%.

The car inspection department, in coordination with the new shunting method and the station technical operation process, implemented the horizontal operation method for train inspections, reducing the train departure inspection time from 35 minutes to 23 minutes. Under the influence of Soviet experts' repeated emphasis on saving and utilizing the railway's potential capabilities, general car inspectors implemented the idea of vehicles serving transportation, and a large number of defective and damaged cars were repaired. According to the survey statistics of the Vehicle Department of the Bureau at the end of March, the bureau reduced 475 defective passenger and freight cars throughout the year, increasing the use of existing cars.

The electrical work of the Central-Changchun Railway has absorbed Soviet advanced experience, systematically implemented the electrical technical operation process table, the joint work area and the collective call method, greatly reduced obstacles, and gradually improved call efficiency. Statistics at the end of March showed that the utilization efficiency of the bureau's return lines increased by 57%, saving more than 5,000 kilometers of redundant lines.

As a result of the unified dispatch and the implementation of technical operation process measures at marshalling stations, the global turnaround mileage in May last year was 398 kilometers, and the turnaround rate was 2.04 days. In March this year, the turnaround mileage was 499 kilometers, and the turnaround rate was 2.26 days, which was significantly improved. The travel speed increased from 23.8 kilometers in May last year to 25 kilometers in March this year, and the stop time decreased from 13 hours to 11.9 hours.

While announcing the production and financial plans and determining working capital, the bureau formulated plans and steps to promote Soviet advanced methods. The results after promotion were great. Since August last year, 69 advanced working methods have been launched in various business units of the bureau and have achieved good results. Since the introduction and promotion of the Kovalev engineer work method at the Harbin Railway Factory in November last year, the mechanical branch of the factory alone has created 58 new technical standards. Thanks to the help and guidance of Soviet experts, close cooperation between Chinese and Soviet employees, and the above-mentioned advanced working methods and a series of reasonable measures, the overall operating income completed 127% of the plan, the actual expenditure was 13% less than the plan, and the total profit was 455% of the plan, saving the country considerable financial resources. As a result, the lives of the vast majority of employees have been improved. According to statistics from the Finance Department of the China Changchun Railway Bureau, the expenditure on medical and health care in one year was 2,155.5 million yuan (converted from Northeast currency). According to statistics from the Personnel Department, there were 45,425 awards in the past year, and a total of RMB 3,542,634,000 yuan was spent on bonuses. Among them, the number of awards won by workers accounted for 81.3% of the total. Under the guidance of Soviet advanced experience, the China Changchun Railway Administration is making continuous progress day by day. The bureau has laid the foundation for the implementation of economic accounting in the past year. To date, there are five sub-bureaus and twenty-three sections, a total of twenty-eight units, that have fully implemented economic accounting.

　　中长路千余员工在哈尔滨举行盛会
    庆祝中长铁路公司成立一周年
    该路一年来已奠定实行经济核算基础
    为纪念中国长春铁路公司成立一周年，中国长春铁路公司监事会、中国长春铁路局、中国铁路工会中长区委会于二十五日在哈尔滨举行庆祝大会。到会者有中长铁路公司理事会主席余光生、副主席叶洛果夫和该局先进工作者、劳动模范及职工代表一千余人。中央人民政府铁道部滕代远部长、东北人民政府财政经济委员会副主任朱理志均亲临参加。会场台上悬挂中苏两国人民领袖毛泽东主席及斯大林大元帅画像，台上正面为毛主席题的：“我希望中苏两国人民的友谊极大的巩固和发展起来”的巨幅标语，两旁有中央人民政府铁道部、铁道部政治部及中国铁路工会全国委员会的贺幛。庆祝大会于二时开始，中长铁路公司理事会副主席叶洛果夫首先向大会建议选举斯大林大元帅、毛泽东主席为大会名誉主席团，到会人员一致起立鼓掌通过。大会由中长铁路公司理事会余光生主席报告中长路在中苏两国政府的正确领导下，一年来所获得的巨大成就。继由滕代远部长、叶洛果夫副主席等讲话。滕部长在讲话中盛赞中长路一年来在苏联专家的热心帮助和全体员工努力下所获得的成绩，并勖勉全局继续努力，学习苏联先进经验，获得更大的成就。
    又，中长铁路管理局由于中苏两国政府的正确领导，中苏职工的密切合作，以及在苏联专家的热忱友谊的帮助、指导下，获得显著成绩。
    该局自去年五月独立工作开始，已在贯彻经济核算制度的方针下，逐步吸取了苏联先进经验，建立了组织，核定了定员，编制了生产财务计划，清理了流动资金，有计划地推行了苏联铁路先进工作方法，并且加强了财务统计工作，因而在该局的经营与管理上获得很大进展。这表现在一系列的先进工作方法的推行上：五百公里运动展开后，提高了机车运用效率，全局五百公里机车回数今年三月较去年七月增加了百分之五十七。参加五百公里运动的机车增加了六倍。由于机车锅炉水质软化工作的推行，使机车洗检公里由三千公里普遍延长到四千至四千五百公里，从而减少了不良机车运用。根据中长局机务处计算：仅段修不良机车率已由去年五月的百分之十九，一减而为今年三月份的百分之九·三。伴随着新检修法的推行，洗检停留时间也由四十一·五小时减为二○·三小时。在苏联先进经验指导下，机车事故大为减少。现该局安全走行十万公里以上的机车占全部运用机车的百分之三十。
    为了减少工程施工上的浪费，该局去年八月份有计划地审核了新建工程件名表，整顿了设计预算工作，并建立了一定的工程验收制度，又推行了各季新养路法和大型建筑物预防计划和补修方法，提高了线路维修工率，使线路补修计划超额完成，去年五月至十二月完成维修计划的百分之一○八，今年第一季度完成百分之一六六，全局线路质量够良好程度者占百分之八十以上。
    检车部门配合新调车法与车站技术作业过程实行了列检横作业法，使列车始发检查时间，由过去的三十五分降到二十三分。在苏联专家再三强调节约与发挥铁路潜在能力的影响下，一般检车人员贯彻了车辆为运输服务的思想，大量修复了不良残车。根据该局车辆处三月末的调查统计，一年当中全局减少不良客货残车四七五辆，增加了现车运用。
    中长局的电务工作吸取了苏联先进经验，有步骤的贯彻电务技术作业过程表，联合工区和集户呼唤法，障碍大大减少，通话效率逐步提高。三月末统计，该局回线运用效率提高了百分之五七，节省多余线条五千多公里。
    由于统一调度和编组站实行技术作业过程措施的结果，全局去年五月周转行程为三九八公里，周转率为二·○四天，今年三月周转行程为四九九公里，周转率为二·二六天。相对有了显著提高；旅行速度由去年五月二三·八公里，今年三月增为二五公里，停站时间由十三小时减为十一·九小时。
    在公布生产财务计划和确定流动资金的同时，该局就制定了推行苏联先进方法的计划和步骤。推行后成果很大。去年八月起已有六十九种先进工作方法开始在该局各业务单位推行，并且都已获得良好效果。郭瓦廖夫工程师工作方法自去年十一月在哈尔滨铁路工厂介绍推广后，到现在为止，仅该厂机械分厂即已创造了五十八种新的技术标准。由于苏联专家的帮助与指导，中苏职工密切合作，以及以上的先进工作方法和一系列的合理措施，整个营业收入完成计划百分之一百二十七，实际支出较计划减少百分之十三，总利润为计划的百分之四百五十五，给国家节省了很可观的资财。因而，改善了广大职工的生活。根据中长局财务处的统计，一年中医药卫生费的支出二十一亿五千五百万元（由东北币折合）。根据人事处统计，去年一年中奖励次数为四万五千四百二十五次，支出奖金共计人民币三、五四二、六三四、○○○元。其中工人得奖数字占总额百分之八十一·三。中长铁路管理局在苏联先进经验指导下，正日新月异的继续进展。该局在过去一年中已给实行经济核算奠定了基础。至目前为止，该局完全实行经济核算的单位已有五个分局，二十三个段，共计二十八个单位。
