　　American Aggressors Plot to Expand War of Aggression
    U.S. Seventh Fleet "Exercises" in Taiwan Strait

    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch] Simultaneously with American planes bombing our Northeast and harassing our coastal areas in Fujian Province, the U.S. Navy Seventh Fleet is actually holding "exercises" in the Taiwan Strait of our country. The commander of the fleet, Vice Admiral Martin, also flew to Taipei on the 13th aboard a naval fighter plane to "visit" the Chiang Kai-shek bandit. After visiting the Chiang bandit, Martin told reporters: "One of my tasks is to 'defend' Taiwan from attack. If an attack occurs, the Seventh Fleet will naturally rise up to fight." These words and actions of the American aggressors show that they are not only determined to continue to霸占 (bà zhàn - forcibly occupy) our territory of Taiwan, but also plotting to expand the war of aggression. The Seventh Fleet's "exercise" began on the 10th and continued for four consecutive days.

　　美侵略者阴谋扩大侵略战争
    美国海军第七舰队在台湾海峡“演习”
    【新华社十五日讯】与美国飞机轰炸我国东北和侵扰我国福建沿海地区同时，美海军第七舰队竟在我国台湾海峡举行“演习”。该舰队司令马丁海军中将，并于十三日乘海军战斗机飞抵台北“访问”蒋匪介石。马丁于访问蒋匪后向记者说：“余之任务之一为‘防卫’台湾不受攻击，苟有攻击发生，第七舰队自当起而作战。”美国侵略者的这种言论和行动，表明它们不仅决心继续霸占我国领土台湾，而且阴谋扩大侵略战争。第七舰队的“演习”自十日起，曾连续举行了四天。
