　　Welcoming the "May Day" Labor Day
    Li Junting of Jiawang Coal Mine in Shandong Creates New National Record
    Hanqiao Mine of Jiawang Coal Mine in Shandong is welcoming the great "May Day" Labor Day with one new record after another. Inspired by patriotic enthusiasm, the pneumatic drill operators of Hanqiao Mine launched a new record-breaking campaign in mid-March. On March 21, Li Junting's pneumatic drill team in the middle shift mined 108 tons of coal in five and a half hours, setting a new record. On March 25, Song Yukun's team in the early shift mined 150.75 tons of coal in six and a half hours, with a recovery rate of 98%; Minister Chen Yu of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government sent congratulatory telegrams. Encouraged by this, Song Yukun's team became even more enthusiastic and mined 223.5 tons of coal from 9:00 a.m. to 3:55 p.m. on April 16, breaking the record of 215.12 tons set by Chen Yuhua's team in Huainan Coal Mine and creating an unprecedented record in East China. After denouncing the crimes of aggression of U.S. imperialism, all the workers in Hanqiao Mine further raised their political consciousness and clearly realized that only by increasing production and strengthening national defense construction can we crush the aggression of U.S. imperialism and guarantee the fruits of victory for the working class. Based on this idea, the trade union led the workers to formulate a patriotic pact, turning their high patriotic enthusiasm into practical action. In order to welcome the "May Day" Labor Day and celebrate the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, new records are constantly emerging. On April 17, Li Junting's team mined 2.5875 tons of coal in seven hours in a thin coal seam of 1.4 meters thick, breaking the record of 254.4 tons set by Luo Yongjin's team in Fengfeng Coal Mine and creating the highest new record in the country, with a recovery rate of 100%.

　　迎接“五一”劳动节
    山东贾汪煤矿李君亭创全国新纪录
    山东贾汪煤矿韩桥井以一个接一个的新纪录，迎接伟大的“五一”劳动节。该矿韩桥井的风镐手们，在爱国热情的鼓舞下，于三月中旬掀起了创造新纪录运动。三月二十一日中班李君亭风镐组以五小时半的时间，采煤一○八吨，首创新纪录。三月二十五日早班宋玉坤小组又以六小时半采煤一五○·七五吨，回采率达到百分之九十八；当时曾获得中央人民政府燃料工业部陈郁部长等的纷纷电贺。宋玉坤小组得此鼓励后，劳动热情更加奋发，又于四月十六日，从上午九点到下午三点五十五分，采煤二二三·五吨，突破了淮南煤矿陈玉华组二一五·一二吨，创华东区的空前纪录。韩桥井全井工人经过控诉美帝国主义侵略罪行后，进一步提高了政治觉悟，明确认识到只有提高生产，加强国防建设，才能粉碎美帝国主义的侵略，保障工人阶级的胜利果实。在这一思想基础上，工会领导工人订立了爱国公约，把高度的爱国热情变成了实际的行动。并为迎接“五一”劳动节，庆祝劳动保险条例的实施，新纪录更不断的涌现着。四月十七日李君亭小组在厚一·四公尺的薄煤层中，以七小时采煤二·五八七五吨，突破了峰峰煤矿罗永金小组的二五四·四吨，创造了全国最高新纪录，回采率达到百分之百。（中央人民政府燃料工业部通讯组）
