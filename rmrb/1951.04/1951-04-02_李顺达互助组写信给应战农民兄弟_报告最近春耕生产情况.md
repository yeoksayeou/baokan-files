　　Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team Writes to Challenged Farmer Brothers
    Reporting on Recent Spring Plowing Production
    [Our Newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The mutual aid team led by Li Shunda, a labor model from Xigou Village, Ping顺 County, Shanxi Province, wrote a letter on the 25th of last month to labor models and mutual aid teams across the country who responded to their challenge, reporting on their recent spring plowing production. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Comrades labor models and mutual aid teams from all over the country:

    Since we proposed a production competition to farmer brothers across the country on March 6th, we have recently seen news in the newspapers about your enthusiastic response, which has given us great encouragement! Now, encouraged by patriotic enthusiasm for resisting America and aiding Korea, all members of the team are showing even more enthusiasm and tension in spring plowing production than in previous years. We have now prepared eight months' worth of fuel and 126 dan of fertilizer per mu. We have also overcome the difficulties of heavy snow and muddy roads, getting up early and working late to send all the manure to the fields. The seeds we are preparing to sow have all been evaluated, and we have selected the best four from the original thirteen varieties of improved grain. In terms of agricultural tools, in order to fully utilize the effectiveness of new agricultural tools, we have also stipulated scientific and rational methods for using and storing agricultural tools, and have made twelve different types of hoes. Now, we are vigorously carrying out soil improvement work on fifteen mu of land. In order to thoroughly realize the challenge plan to farmers across the country, a heated challenge response has also been launched among all male and female team members, and each person's production competition plan and guarantees have been formulated. Our mutual aid team has also been reorganized, and three team members have been assigned to work as propagandists to strengthen publicity and mobilization work within the team and among farmers in the whole village.
    In order to successfully launch a nationwide patriotic bumper harvest movement this year, we hope that you can introduce us to your valuable production experience so that we can learn from each other!
    Salute to the victory of patriotic production!

                           Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, Xigou Village, Ping顺 County, Shanxi Province
                                              March 25

　　李顺达互助组写信给应战农民兄弟        
    报告最近春耕生产情况
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：山西省平顺县西沟村劳动模范李顺达所领导的互助组，于上月二十五日向全国各地应战的劳动模范和互助组写了一封信，报告他们最近春耕生产的情况，该信全文如下：全国各地劳动模范和互助组同志们：
    自三月六日我们向全国农民兄弟提出生产竞赛以来，最近我们在报纸上接连看到你们热烈应战的消息，给了我们很大的鼓励！现在，全组组员在抗美援朝的爱国热情鼓舞下，春耕生产更显得比往年热烈紧张。我们现在已经把八个月的燃料和每亩一百二十六担的肥料全部准备好了；我们并且克服了雪多路泥的困难，起早搭黑地将粪全部送到地里；我们准备下种的种籽，已全部经过评选，并从原有的十三种优良谷种中，选出了最好的四种。在农具方面，我们为了充分发挥新式农具的效能，又规定了科学合理使用和保管农具的办法；并打了各式锄头十二张。现在，我们正在大力进行十五亩土地的土壤改良工作。我们为了彻底实现向全国农民的挑战计划，全组男女组员之间亦展开了热烈的挑战应战，并订出了每个人的生产竞赛计划和保证。我们互助组内又重新进行了整顿，并有三个组员担任了宣传员的工作，加强向组内和全村农民的宣传鼓动工作。
    为了胜利开展今年全国规模的爱国丰产运动，我们希望你们能将宝贵的生产经验介绍给我们，以互相学习！
    致爱国主义生产胜利的敬礼！
                           山西省平顺县西沟村李顺达互助组
                                              三月二十五日
