　　Implementing the Policy of Protecting Housing and Developing Industry and Commerce
    Beijing Issues Trial Measures for Handling "Pudianquan" Disputes

    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Municipal People's Government has recently issued "Trial Measures for Handling 'Pudianquan' Disputes," prohibiting the creation, sale, lease, pawn, and mortgage of "pudianquan." This is another powerful measure to implement the policy of protecting housing.

    "Pudianquan" has existed for a long time, and the situation is complex. It is a social problem that exists in large quantities in Beijing. The so-called "pudi" originated in the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. Originally, it referred to a business that rented a house for business. When it closed down, it would transfer the business name, furniture, goods, equipment, and the lease right of the property to others to continue the business. This is called "pudi." The business that takes over then establishes a lease relationship with the landlord, and can still transfer it to others when it closes down. In the process of transfer, businesses generally invest in the houses, and those with construction projects invest even more. In this way, the transfer of "pudi" forms a special custom in the housing lease relationship. The rights of the "pudianquan" owner and the landlord are very difficult to distinguish. Some "pudianquan" owners rent out the shops according to market prices, but pay very low "fixed" rents to the landlord, thus making high profits, which has caused many disputes. For example, landlord Jin Chenghan has ninety shop houses, half of which cannot collect rent, and the annual rental income is not enough to pay property tax. No. 240 Chongnei Avenue has twenty-four shop houses, with a monthly rent of six bags of flour. The "pudianquan" owner receives five bags, and the landlord receives one bag. As a result, for the house, the landlord naturally does not repair the house because there is no profit to be made, and the "pudianquan" owner mostly believes that the property right is not their own, so they do not repair it either. This affects the repair of the houses, accelerates the decay and collapse of the houses, and causes more disputes.

    These disputes already existed in large quantities during the rule of the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Since liberation, many landlords have filed lawsuits with the Municipal People's Court. The court found it difficult to handle because there were no regulations. At the same time, citizens have sent letters to the Municipal People's Government, and representatives of the Municipal and District People's Congresses have also submitted proposals requesting a solution to the "pudianquan" problem. In order to handle it carefully, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, in December 1949, instructed the Beijing Municipal People's Court to work with the Municipal People's Government Research Office, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and eight other relevant units to organize the "Beijing Municipal Pudianquan Handling Committee" to conduct investigations and research. In early 1950, the committee drafted a draft, which was repeatedly discussed and revised by the Municipal People's Government, and "Trial Measures for Handling 'Pudianquan' Disputes" were formulated (see the lower right corner of page four of today's newspaper). It is now being submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval, and is being given to the Municipal People's Court for trial implementation.

　　贯彻保护房屋与发展工商业的政策
    北京市发布“铺底权”纠纷处理试行办法
    【本报讯】北京市人民政府顷发布“关于铺底权纠纷处理试行办法”，禁止“铺底权”的创设、买卖、租赁、典、质等行为，这是贯彻保护房屋政策的又一有力措施。
    “铺底权”相沿已久，情况复杂，是北京市大量存在的一个社会问题。所谓“铺底”起源于满清乾隆年间，原为租房营业的商号，因歇业而把字号、家具、货底、设备等和房产的租赁权一起倒给他人继续营业，这就叫做“铺底”。承倒商号再和房东建立租赁关系，歇业时仍可倒给他人。在倒兑过程中，一般商号对房屋都有投资，有建筑工程的则投资更多。这样，出倒铺底在房屋租赁关系上就形成一种特殊习惯，“铺底权”所有人与房东的权利很不容易划分，某些“铺底权”所有人将铺房随行市出租，却向房东交很低的“固定”租金，从中获取高利，因而产生了很多纠纷。如房主金承汉有铺房九十户，其中半数不能收租，全年房租收入尚不够交地产税。崇内大街二百四十号有铺房二十四间，每月房租六袋面粉，“铺底权”所有人收五袋，房东收一袋。其结果，就房屋来说，房东因无利可图当然不修房，“铺底权”所有人多认为产权非自己所有亦不修理。这样就影响了房屋的修缮，加速了房屋的腐坏与倒塌，酿成了更多的纠纷。
    这些纠纷，在日伪和国民党反动派统治时期已大量存在。解放以来，房主向市人民法院起诉的很多。法院因无规定，处理很感困难。同时，市民纷纷向市人民政府来信，市、区各界人民代表会议代表也有提案要求解决“铺底权”问题。北京市人民政府为了慎重处理起见，在一九四九年十二月，责成北京市人民法院会同市人民政府研究室、市总工会、工商联合会等八个有关单位，组织“北京市铺底权处理委员会”，进行调查研究。在一九五○年初，该委员会拟定了草案，经过市人民政府反复讨论修正，制定“关于铺底权纠纷处理试行办法”（见今日本报第四版右下角）。现一面报请政务院核备，一面即交市人民法院试行。
