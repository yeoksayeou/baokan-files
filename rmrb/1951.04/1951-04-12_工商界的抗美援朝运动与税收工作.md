Since the nationwide business and industrial community, led by major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, launched the patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, five months have passed. This movement has gradually spread from major cities to small and medium-sized towns, and even remote border regions have been somewhat influenced. Participants in this movement include large industrialists and businessmen, shopkeepers, merchants, and peddlers. After the movement unfolded, it received strong support and encouragement from workers, farmers, students, and local Party and government leaders in various regions, which further enhanced the patriotic awareness of the business and industrial community.

This movement is gradually deepening and closely integrating with the patriotic actions of the business and industrial community. The general process is: from studying current affairs, discussing the situation, sending telegrams of solidarity, and holding demonstrations and parades, to actively improving business operations, opposing speculation and profiteering, assisting the government in stabilizing prices, and enthusiastically paying taxes. It is rare in history for the Chinese business and industrial community to oppose imperialist aggression with such a large-scale patriotic action. In the era of the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule, paying taxes was a heavy burden for the business and industrial community, but today it has become a glorious task! The business and industrial community's new understanding of national taxation is a significant progress. This not only improves the relationship between taxpayers and tax collectors (the state) but will also lead the country's tax work to a new stage. The continued and in-depth implementation of the business and industrial community's enthusiastic tax payment, ensuring that various urban taxes, which account for a large proportion of national revenue, are remitted to the national treasury on time, guarantees various national expenditures, which is a great contribution to the country.

Attention should be paid to the development of the nationwide business and industrial community's Resist America, Aid Korea movement and the new situation it has created in tax work.

Based on the development of the movement over the past five months, the situation is roughly as follows:

In early November 1950, the federations of industry and commerce in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin successively convened symposiums on current affairs for representatives from various trades and industries, enthusiastically discussing the joint declaration of the various democratic parties and Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. They expressed infinite indignation at the US imperialist aggression against Korea, which threatened our country's security. Representatives from the business and industrial communities in major cities delivered speeches, calling on the business and industrial community to rise up and participate in this great patriotic movement. On November 14th, the Tianjin business and industrial community adopted four specific tasks as a program of action, and the Beijing business and industrial community also formulated patriotic covenants, one of which was to not owe taxes, not evade taxes, not speculate, not hoard, and not disrupt finance. Representatives from the business and industrial communities in cities such as Wuhan and Guangzhou also successively discussed the tasks in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and formulated patriotic covenants.

On November 30th, the Tianjin business and industrial community took the lead in launching a city-wide demonstration and parade of more than 42,900 people to resist America and aid Korea. On that day, the city was decorated with national flags, and the participants in the parade beat drums and gongs, shouted slogans, and marched with great spirit and solemnity. Gray-haired old men and young accountants all participated, passing three resolutions and sending a telegram to Chairman Mao, expressing the Tianjin business and industrial community's determination to resist America and aid Korea. Chairman Mao specially replied on December 2nd, encouraging their patriotic actions and calling on all patriotic industrialists, businessmen, and the masses of the people across the country to form a united front against imperialist aggression that was even more consolidated than in the past. From then on, this movement spread throughout the country.

On December 9th, Beijing held a large demonstration of more than 53,000 people. Each unit participating in the demonstration put forward specific patriotic covenants based on their own business operations. On December 16th, the Shanghai business and industrial community, consisting of 150,000 people from more than 300 industries, also held a large demonstration and parade. Wherever the demonstration and parade队伍went, firecrackers were set off, and workers, students, and other people's organizations formed dozens of propaganda stations to continuously encourage them to move forward. Major and medium-sized cities such as Chongqing, Nanjing, Wuhan, Changsha, Guilin, Shenyang, Qingdao, Hangzhou, Xi'an, Jinan, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, and Fuzhou all responded to Chairman Mao's call, formulated patriotic covenants, held demonstrations and parades, and raised comfort goods to support our volunteer troops going to Korea.

The business and industrial community further guaranteed the completion of tax tasks through mutual competition. In Tianjin, the industrial and commercial tax for the second half of 1950 was completed in just half a month for all declaration and evaluation procedures. The date for depositing taxes into the treasury was originally scheduled to begin on December 16th, but many industries concentrated their tax payments to the trade association or deposited them in the bank before the scheduled date. In Shanghai, according to statistics from the nine district tax bureaus, 64% to 90% of back taxes were paid off in November and December. The East China region overfulfilled the tasks for various taxes in the winter of 1950. The Datong City Federation of Industry and Commerce in southern Anhui challenged Wuhu City to complete tax payments, and the silk and cloth industry in Wuxi City, southern Jiangsu, completed 80% of the 1949 income tax payment in one day, and the warehousing industry paid off all tax payments within one day.

On January 28, 1951, more than 10,000 industrial and commercial households in Nanjing City held a collective parade to pay the autumn business tax for 1950. Before the parade, 37 industries had collectively paid taxes in advance, accounting for one-half of the 74 industries assessed. On that day, the collective tax payment队伍set out in the early morning and converged into a数里的队伍, heading to the locations designated by the tax bureau to collectively pay taxes, and was welcomed by people from all walks of life along the way.

This enthusiastic tax payment movement is unfolding in major and medium-sized cities. In Shantou City, Guangdong Province, the business and industrial community paid taxes while beating gongs and drums and performing the Yangge dance. Students from primary and secondary schools and shop employees organized Yangge teams and harmonica teams to automatically participate in the collective tax payment行列. Female students said to them enthusiastically: "We want to pay our respects to you, and hope that you will continue to maintain today's enthusiasm for paying taxes in the future." This moved the industrialists and businessmen, who said: "The youth are dedicating themselves to defending the motherland, how can we industrialists and businessmen still conceal and delay taxes? How can we face these passionate youth?" They also said: "The youth join the army, we pay taxes, and the country will surely win." This movement is also gradually developing towards small towns. In Nanping, Fujian Province, the business and industrial community, holding a red flag in one hand and tax payments wrapped in red paper in the other, cleared all tax payments in less than an hour with the accompaniment of the waist drum team from Jianjin Middle School, and won the title of tax payment model. Tax payments in ethnic minority areas such as Zhalantun in Inner Mongolia and Linxia City in Gansu Province in the Northwest region are also faster than in the past.

The business and industrial community's enthusiastic tax payment movement is also combined with the commendation of tax payment models by local government tax authorities. For example, Beijing held a group leader award ceremony for industrial and commercial groups, awarding them with award banners, certificates, or items. In Nanjing's award ceremony, not only Party and government leaders participated, but also labor models and employee representatives from factories and enterprises participated. Each award recipient wore a large red flower on their chest, giving the business and industrial community great encouragement. The business and industrial community's automatic tax payment to the country became glorious and was respected by the people. Conversely, tax evasion and arrears were considered shameful and were subject to the business and industrial community's own exposure and criticism.

Why has the business and industrial community's Resist America, Aid Korea movement progressed so rapidly? This is because: For a hundred years, the imperialists' enslavement and oppression of the Chinese nation has not only harmed the broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, but also the national industry and commerce, which has been squeezed and undermined by the imperialists. They feel that resisting America and aiding Korea is to defend their own interests. Since the liberation of the country, representatives from the business and industrial community have participated in people's governments at all levels and people's congresses at all levels. They have positions and powers, and feel that the New Democratic regime has a share for them. The business and industrial community is one of the four friends. The various policies and measures of the New China, such as clearing imperialist forces, abolishing feudal exploitation, and protecting and developing private industry and commerce, are all related to their own interests. What is particularly important is that, under the guarantee of the correct policies and effective measures of the Central People's Government in stabilizing prices and adjusting industry and commerce over the past year, private industrialists and businessmen have made great economic progress. Since the adjustment of industry and commerce last year, private industry and commerce across the country have gradually embarked on the road of recovery and development. Taking Tianjin as an example: a total of 6,514 industrial and commercial establishments opened in the city last year, and 4,595 closed down. The actual increase after offsetting the openings and closures was 1,919, not including small-scale handicraft industries and peddlers. Taking December 1949 as the base period for Shanghai's industrial electricity consumption, the lowest point before April 1950 was only 38.8%. Since June, it has increased month by month, and in November it reached approximately 122%. Comparing the output of Shanghai's main industrial products in November 1950 with that of June, cotton spinning increased by more than 40%, dyeing and weaving increased by 30%, papermaking increased by 81%, and silk weaving increased by 34.6%. In the future, private industry and commerce will continue to develop under the leadership of the national economy. Our thorough elimination of the shackles and threats of imperialism is precisely to enable industry and commerce across the country to develop. In fact, since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, industry and commerce have already received great benefits. Therefore, it is no accident that this movement can be so vigorous and enthusiastic. Secondly, due to the glorious victories of our Resist America, Aid Korea Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army on the front line, the international situation has been reversed, and the international status of the People's Republic of China and its prestige among the people of various countries have been greatly enhanced. This has made the business and industrial community deeply believe in the correctness of the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and they feel extremely excited and glorious to be a member of the Chinese people. As the Chinese people, it is their inescapable duty to contribute money and pay taxes according to the law.

This movement has brought some new problems, and the following should be noted in the future:

First, we should consolidate the existing achievements, continue to promote the movement universally and deeply, and concretely inject this patriotic enthusiasm into various tasks, develop production, improve business operations, and invigorate urban and rural trade. Paying taxes on time should become a conscious movement for the entire business and industrial community. Carry out criticism and self-criticism within the business and industrial community. The Nanjing 10,000-person collective tax payment parade put forward "self-rectification and self-improvement" and "learn from workers and peasants" and achieved good results. At the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Representatives Conference, the business and industrial community also conducted strict criticism and self-criticism of behaviors such as violating patriotic covenants, speculation and hoarding, and tax evasion. Facts have proved that criticism and self-criticism within the business and industrial community can be carried out. At present, the phenomenon of tax evasion is still very serious. In the key re-examination of income tax in Dalian and Lushun in November 1950, problems were found in 240 households out of only 1,800 households examined. Therefore, plugging loopholes in tax evasion is still a task that the business and industrial community needs to continue to implement. In the future, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement should achieve greater results in this regard.

Second, the relationship between industrialists and businessmen and tax authorities has undergone great changes. Everyone handles taxes, everyone participates, and tax collection is no longer just the responsibility of the tax authorities. This is a good start. In the past, it took a long time and complex procedures to complete the work, but now the tax collection procedures have been greatly reduced, and tasks can be completed ahead of schedule or exceeded. The situation in cities such as Dalian and Shanghai proves this, which shows that industrialists and businessmen have made progress in their thinking, which has added favorable conditions to tax work. The tax authorities should pay more attention to this favorable condition, make full use of it, and assist in the development of this condition, and strongly support the business and industrial community's Resist America, Aid Korea movement. The tax authorities should summarize the work experience since the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, cooperate with the business and industrial community to widely launch an enthusiastic tax payment movement, and make it regular. The business and industrial community should also enrich and transform the organization of the Federation of Industry and Commerce during this high tide of mass movement, so that it can more effectively lead the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.

Third, according to the current development of tax work, the tax authorities should strengthen the investigation and research on industrial, commercial, and market conditions, correctly grasp the tax source and the development trend of industry and commerce, create new working methods, and improve the methods of tax assessment and collection. The second is to prevent complacency. Since last winter, the completion of various urban taxes has been very smooth, and some have even exceeded the target. This is the result of everyone's efforts, but the planned figures estimated in the past should be said to be more cautious and conservative. The work over the past year and the recovery and development of private industry and commerce have proved that the correct and close-to-actual plan can only be supplemented and revised in the work process according to the changing and developing situation. Therefore, we cannot be satisfied with completing the original task or exceeding the original plan. There are still many shortcomings in the work, and further efforts are needed to overcome them.

　　工商界的抗美援朝运动与税收工作
    杨济之
    全国工商业界自以北京、上海、天津等大城市为首，展开抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国运动以来，已经五个月了。这一运动已由大城市带头而逐渐推广到中小市镇，偏僻而辽远的边疆地区也受了若干影响。参加到这一运动中的，有大工商业家，有座商、有行商和摊贩。运动展开后，普遍得到各地工人、农民、学生和当地党政首长有力的支持和鼓励，工商界的爱国认识，因此更加提高了。
    这一运动在逐渐走向深入，并和工商界的爱国行动密切结合着。一般的过程是：由学习时事，座谈时局，通电慰劳，示威游行，发展到积极改善经营，反对投机倒把，协助政府稳定物价，踊跃缴纳税款。中国工商界以这种规模宏大的爱国行动反对帝国主义侵略，在历史上还是罕见的，国民党匪帮统治时代，工商界纳税是一种沉重的负担，而今天则变成光荣的任务！工商界对国家税收的新认识，是工商界很大的进步。这样不仅改善了纳税者和收税者（国家）的关系，而且会将国家的税收工作引到一个新的阶段上。工商界踊跃纳税继续贯彻和深入下去，使国家收入占很大比重的各项城市税收，能按期解入国库，保证了国家的各项支出，这对国家的贡献是很大的。
    全国工商界抗美援朝运动发展的情况及由此所造成税收工作上的新形势，应该加以注意。
    根据五个月运动发展的情况，大致如下：
    一九五○年十一月初，北京、上海、天津等大城市的工商联合会，均先后召开了各行各业代表人物的时事座谈会，热烈讨论了各民主党派的联合宣言和周外长的声明。对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜威胁我国的安全，表示无限的愤慨。各大城市工商界代表人物均发表谈话，号召工商界起来，参加这一伟大的爱国运动，天津工商界十一月十四日通过四项具体任务，作为行动纲领，北京工商界也订立了爱国公约，其中一项是不欠税、不逃税、不投机、不倒把、不扰乱金融。武汉、广州等城市的工商界代表也先后讨论了抗美援朝运动中的任务，并定出爱国公约。
    十一月三十日天津工商界，首先发动了全市四万二千九百余人抗美援朝示威大游行。是日全市悬挂国旗，参加游行者锣鼓喧天，高呼口号，游行者气概轩昂，行列庄严，白发苍苍的老人和青年管帐先生们都参加进来，通过三项决定，并致电毛主席，表明天津工商界抗美援朝的决心。毛主席特于十二月二日复电，鼓励他们这种爱国主义的行动，并号召全国一切爱国的工商业家和人民大众一道，结成一条比过去更加巩固的反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线。从此，这一运动在全国范围内便普遍展开了。
    北京十二月九日举行了五万三千多人的大示威，每个参加示威的单位根据自己经营的业务提出具体的爱国公约。上海工商界三百多行业十五万人，也于十二月十六日举行示威大游行，示威游行的队伍走到那里，那里就燃放鞭炮，工人学生及其他人民团体组织成几十个鼓动站不断地鼓动他们前进。重庆、南京、武汉、长沙、桂林、沈阳、青岛、杭州、西安、济南、太原、张家口、福州等大中城市均一致响应毛主席的号召，制定爱国公约，示威游行，募集慰劳品，支援去朝鲜的我国志愿部队。
    工商界更进一步以相互竞赛方式保证税收任务的完成。天津一九五○年度下半年工商业税，仅仅半个月便完成了全部申报、评议手续，纳库日期原定十二月十六日开始，但许多行业在规定的日期之前即把税款集中到同业公会或存入银行。上海十一、十二两个月中，根据九个区税务分局材料统计，分别缴清欠税百分之六十四到百分之九十。华东区一九五○年冬季各项税收均超额完成了任务。皖南大通市工商联合会以完成纳税向芜湖市挑战，苏南无锡市绸布业缴清一九四九年所得税，一天完成百分之八十，仓库业一天内将税款全部缴清。
    一九五一年一月二十八日南京市一万多工商户举行了集体缴纳一九五○年秋季营业税的大游行。在游行之前，已有三十七个行业预先集体缴纳了税款，占全部受评七十四个行业的二分之一。是日，集体缴税的队伍清晨分头出发，汇成长达数里的队伍，前往税务局指定的地点集体缴税，沿途受到各界人民的欢迎。
    这种踊跃纳税的运动正在大中城市展开，广东汕头市工商界打着锣鼓扭着秧歌去缴税，中小学校学生和店员职工组织秧歌队口琴队自动参加集体缴税的行列，女学生们很热诚地对他们说：“我们要向你们致敬，希望以后仍要保持今天的缴税热情。”感动了工商业者，他们说：“青年们献身保卫祖国，我们工商业者要再瞒税、拖税，有何面目见这些热血青年？”并说：“青年参军，我们缴税，国家一定胜利。”这运动也逐渐向小市镇发展，福建省南平工商界一手拿着红旗，一手拿着用红纸包好了的税款，在剑津中学腰鼓队的伴送下，不到一小时就缴清了全部的税款，获得缴税模范的称号。少数民族地区如内蒙古札兰屯，西北区甘肃省的临夏市纳税均比过去为快。
    工商界踊跃纳税的运动又和各地政府税务机关的表扬纳税模范相结合着。如北京市分区举行了工商业组长奖励模范联欢大会，分别授与奖旗奖状或物品。南京的授奖大会不仅有党政首长参加，工厂企业的劳动模范及职工代表也来参加，受奖者每人胸前都挂上了大朵的红花，给予了工商界以莫大的鼓舞。工商界自动给国家缴税成为光荣，受到人民的尊敬。反之，偷漏及拖欠税款便被认为是耻辱，受到工商界自己的检举和批评。
    工商界的抗美援朝运动为什么如此迅速进展呢？这是由于：百年来帝国主义者对中华民族的奴役压迫，不仅广大的工人农民知识分子身受其害，民族工商业也一样受到帝国主义者的排挤和摧残，他们感到抗美援朝就是保卫他们自己的利益。全国解放以来，各级人民政府，各级人民代表会中均有工商界的代表人物参加，他们有职有权，感到新民主主义的政权有他们一份，工商界是四个朋友中的一个，新中国的各项政策和措施如扫清帝国主义势力，废除封建剥削，保护发展私人工商业，均对他们切身利益攸关。尤其重要的是一年多来，在中央人民政府稳定物价，调整工商业等正确方针和有效措施的保障下，私人工商业者在经济上有很大发展，自去年调整工商业以来，全国私营工商业均逐渐走上恢复和发展的道路。以天津为例：全市去年工商业开业共计六千五百十四户，歇业四千五百九十五户，开歇相抵实增一千九百十九户，小型手工业和摊贩还未包括在内。上海工业用电量如以一九四九年十二月数字为基期，一九五○年四月以前最低时仅达百分之三十八点八，自六月份起逐月增加，十一月份约达百分之一百二十二。上海主要工业品产量，如以一九五○年十一月份和六月份比较，棉纺增百分之四十以上，染织增百分之三十，造纸增百分之八十一，丝织增百分之三十四点六。今后私营工商业在国家经济领导下，仍将继续发展，我们彻底肃清帝国主义的束缚和威胁，正是使全国工商业能有一个发展，事实上自抗美援朝运动发动以后，工商业已经受到很大的利益，因此，这一运动能如此蓬勃热烈不是偶然的。其次，由于我抗美援朝志愿军与朝鲜人民军在前线一次又一次的辉煌的胜利，扭转了国际局势，大大提高了中华人民共和国的国际地位，和在各国人民中的威信；这使工商界深信毛主席和中央人民政府领导的正确，而以自己是中国人民的一分子而感到莫大的兴奋和光荣，作为中国人民，有钱出钱依法纳税自然是义不容辞的应尽的责任。
    这一运动带来一些新的问题，今后应注意的是：
    第一、应该巩固已有的成绩，把运动继续普遍和深入下去，把这种爱国主义的积极性具体贯注到各项工作中去，发展生产，改善经营，活跃城乡贸易。应把按期缴纳税款成为全体工商业界的自觉运动。开展工商界内部的批评与自我批评。南京万人集体缴税大游行，提出“自整自肃”“向工人农民看齐”收到良好的效果。在上海工商业代表会议中，工商界也对破坏爱国公约、投机倒把、逃税漏税等行为进行了严格的批评与自我批评，事实证明，工商界内部的批评与自我批评是可以展开的。目前漏税现象仍很严重，旅大在一九五○年十一月所得税重点复查中，仅查一千八百余户，有问题者达二百四十户。因此，堵塞逃税漏税，仍然是工商界自己尚待继续贯彻的任务，在今后抗美援朝运动中在这方面应该收到更大的效果。
    第二、工商业者和税务机关的关系，有了很大的改变。大家办税，大家动手，收税不仅仅是税务机关的事。这已是一个良好的开端。过去需要很长时期经过很繁杂的手续能完成的工作，现在则大大缩减了征税手续，并能提前或超额完成任务，如大连上海等城市的情况证明了这点，这说明工商业者思想上有了进步，使税收工作增加了有利条件，税务机关应更加重视这种有利条件，充分利用并协助这种条件的发展，大力支援工商界的抗美援朝运动。税务机关应该总结抗美援朝运动以来的工作经验，与工商界相配合普遍开展踊跃纳税运动，并使之经常化。工商界亦应在这群众运动高潮中充实和改造工商联合会的组织，使更加有力地领导抗美援朝运动。
    第三、根据当前税务工作发展的情况，税务机关应该加强对工商业及市场情况的调查研究工作，正确地掌握税源和工商业发展的趋势，创造新的工作方法，改进评税征税方法。其次是防止自满的情绪。自去冬以来，城市各项税收在完成任务上是很顺利的，有的并超过任务，这是大家的努力的结果，但是过去所估计的计划数字，应该说还是比较慎重和保守的，经过一年来的工作和私营工商业的恢复和发展的情况证明，正确接近实际的计划只有在工作过程中根据变化着和发展着的情况来补充修正才行，因此不能以完成原定任务或超过原定计划为满足。工作中尚有很多缺点，还须进一步努力来克服。
