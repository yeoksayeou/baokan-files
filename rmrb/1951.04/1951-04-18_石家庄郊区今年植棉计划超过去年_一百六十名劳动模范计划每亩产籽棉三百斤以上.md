　　The farmers in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City, who achieved universal bumper harvests in 1950, are extremely enthusiastic about planting cotton and are formulating cotton bumper harvest plans. This year, the city's suburbs plan to plant 48,000 mu of cotton, an increase of 23 percent over last year. The planned yield is 220 jin of seed cotton per mu (last year the city averaged 200 jin). Liuying Village, which averaged 293 jin of seed cotton per mu last year, plans to produce 300 jin this year and strive to exceed that. The households of 160 model workers plan to exceed 300 jin per mu, with Zhang Junqi and Pang Luke striving to reach 500 jin of seed cotton per mu, and Liang Jiarui even striving for a record of 570 jin. In order to achieve the above-mentioned bumper harvest plan, the suburbs of the city have put forward the slogan of plowing the land four times, harrowing it six times, hoeing it eight times, and universally deep plowing by one inch, and universally implementing soaking seeds in boiling water. At present, all 6,000 mu of cotton fields in the city's suburbs that were not plowed last autumn have been plowed, and most of the cotton fields have been harrowed twice. Three to four carts of coarse fertilizer per mu have been delivered to the fields. In addition to the considerable amount of fine fertilizer already prepared by the masses, it is still hoped that the government will provide some loans, because the suburbs have little land (1.5 mu per person), and the peasants have only recently been liberated, their consumption is high, and their ability to accumulate funds for expanded reproduction is still insufficient. According to the reflections of the model workers in various villages, as long as the government provides some fertilizer this year, the peasants will be completely self-reliant next year. In order to strengthen the leadership of spring plowing, the Municipal People's Government has organized 15 cadres to go to various villages to inspect the preparation work for cotton planting.

　　石家庄郊区今年植棉计划超过去年
    一百六十名劳动模范计划每亩产籽棉三百斤以上
    一九五○年获得普遍丰产纪录的石家庄市郊区，农民群众植棉情绪空前高涨，纷纷制定棉花丰产计划。今年全市郊区计划植棉四八○○○亩，比去年增加百分之二十三。每亩计划产籽棉二二○斤（去年全市平均二○○斤）。去年平均每亩产籽棉达二九三斤的留营村，今年计划产三○○斤，并争取超过。一六○名劳动模范的户计划均超过三○○斤，其中张君琪、庞洛可则争取达到每亩产籽棉五○○斤，梁嘉瑞则更争取达到五七○斤的纪录。为达到上述丰产计划，全市郊区提出地耕四遍，耙六遍、锄八遍，普遍深耕一寸的口号，并要普遍作到开水浸种。现全市郊区去年未秋耕的六○○○亩棉田已全部耕完，棉田大部耙过两遍。粗肥每亩三至四车已全部送到地里，细肥除群众已准备相当数量外，仍盼政府贷放一部，因郊区地少（每人一亩半），农民翻身不久，消费较大，积累资金扩大再生产的力量还不足。据各村劳动模范反映，只要今年政府再贷些肥料，明年农民就可以完全自力更生了。为加强春耕领导，该市人民政府已组织干部十五人分赴各村检查植棉准备工作。
