    Railway Materials Cannot Be Bought and Sold Arbitrarily
    Wanping County Armed Forces Department and Other Agencies Should Conduct Self-Criticism
    Editor:
    The Wanping County Armed Forces Department, the Ninth Public Security Police Station of Wanping County, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and the Beijing Public Security Section and other agencies violated government decrees by allowing the masses to buy and sell railway materials arbitrarily, causing losses to state property. This illegal behavior should be corrected immediately.
    In mid-January, Guo Baochen, a worker at the Xizhimen Engineering Section Resident Office, discovered a cartload of fishplates being pulled from Datai Village, Wanping County, outside Xizhimen. He immediately reported this to Wang Zidong, the squad leader of the Xizhimen Public Security Branch. When Squad Leader Wang inquired, the person selling the iron produced a certificate issued by Comrade Peng Xingyu, the Minister of Armed Forces of Wanping County, which stated: "This is to certify that Peng Fujian of Taizimucun Village, District 3, Wanping County, is selling one hundred and ten catties of old scrap rails that he has stored to the Beijing Jianguo Iron Factory," and so on. Squad Leader Wang telephoned the Beijing Public Security Section for instructions, and the Section replied: "If there is a certificate, let them go." So Squad Leader Wang let them go.
    In late January, Comrade Zhang Molin of the Xizhimen Locomotive Depot Resident Office saw a large cart parked outside the privately-owned Jianguo Iron Factory outside Xizhimen, covered with straw, with steel rails underneath. Upon inquiry by Comrade Zhang, the person selling the steel rails produced a certificate written by Comrade Lü Guangrong of the Ninth Public Security Police Station of Wanping County, which stated: "This is to certify that businessman Cui Huaci purchased four hundred catties of scrap iron, twenty-eight long and short small rails, and two iron plates, which are legitimate transactions and are allowed to be transported to Beijing for sale," and so on. The person selling the steel rails also said: "The government allows us to sell in order to take care of us during the Spring Festival; many farmers in Datai (Wanping) have steel rails in their homes." Comrade Zhang expressed his opinion to the responsible comrade of the Xizhimen Public Security Branch at that time, explaining that such materials should not be bought and sold arbitrarily. In the past, the Jianguo Iron Factory had stored more than two tons of railway materials such as locomotive connecting rods, car door pillars, hook door iron, and fishplates, all of which were exchanged back by the Railway Bureau with scrap iron; this time they should not be allowed to sell these useful materials as scrap iron. However, the Branch never gave a concrete reply. Several days later, Comrade Zhang contacted Squad Leader Wang of the Branch again, but Squad Leader Wang said: "We have already reported this matter. Section Chief Chen of the Third Section of the Tianjin Railway Administration Beijing Public Security Division said: Farmers can sell steel rails. So we let them sell it."
    Based on the above situation, we went to the Beijing Public Security Section to inquire about this matter. Comrade Xing Shuxiang of the Public Security Section said that he had seen a cartload of fishplates brought by farmers from Datai. When he inquired, the farmers produced a certificate of permission to sell issued by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce. He had contacted the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce by telephone, and the comrades of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce said they knew about this matter and said: "If the Ministry of Railways needs it, it can be sold to the Ministry of Railways first; otherwise, farmers can freely buy and sell." Therefore, he let the farmers selling the steel rails go.
    I believe that the comrades in charge of this matter in the Wanping County People's Government Armed Forces Department, the Ninth Public Security Police Station of Wanping County, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and the Beijing Public Security Section have not earnestly assisted the government in collecting lost railway materials, and have not realized that mobilizing the people to automatically donate railway materials to the state is their own responsibility. On the contrary, they have allowed farmers to sell railway materials, which is a manifestation of irresponsibility to state property. I suggest that the Ministry of Railways send personnel to Wanping County and other areas to conduct detailed investigations to understand the situation of local farmers preserving railway materials, mobilize them to donate materials to the state, or have the government purchase them back at an appropriate price, in order to eliminate the waste of state property and better build the people's railways.

    Editor's Note: As early as August 23, 1949, this newspaper published the "Measures for Collecting and Protecting Railway Transportation Materials" formulated by the former Military Commission Railway Department. The measures called on the military and civilians across the country to assist the railway bureaus in collecting and transferring railway transportation materials preserved by the people, collected by public and private institutions, and circulating in the market to the railway bureaus to ensure the rapid restoration of railway transportation. The Wanping County Armed Forces Department, the Ninth Public Security Police Station, and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce allowing people to privately buy and sell railway materials is obviously a violation of policy. The relevant parties should conduct public self-criticism and earnestly correct this phenomenon.

### 铁路器材不能随便买卖  宛平县武装部等机关应作检讨

    铁路器材不能随便买卖
    宛平县武装部等机关应作检讨
    编辑同志：
    宛平县武装部、宛平县第九公安派出所、北京市人民政府工商局及北京市公安段等机关，违犯政府法令，允许群众随便买卖铁路器材，使国家财产受到损失。这种非法行为，应该立即纠正。
    一月中旬，西直门工务段驻在所工友郭宝臣，在西直门外发现由宛平县大台村拉来一车夹板铁。他立刻把这件事情报告给西直门公安分所王子东班长。王班长去查问时，卖铁的人拿出宛平县武装部长彭兴雨同志开的证明书，上面写着：“兹证明宛平县三区太子墓村彭福涧把自己早存废铁轨一百一十斤，出售给北京建国铁工厂”等语。王班长打电话向北京市公安段请示，段上回答说：“有证明就可以放他们走。”王班长就让他们走了。
    一月下旬，西直门机务驻在所张墨林同志又看到西直门外私营建国铁工厂门口，停着一辆大车，上边盖着草，下边是铁轨。经张同志查问，卖钢轨的人掏出宛平县第九公安派出所吕光荣同志写的证明信，上有“证明商民崔化慈购得碎铁四百斤，长短小铁轨二十八根，铁板二块，系正当买卖，准予运往北京出售”等语。卖钢轨的人还说：“政府为了照顾我们过春节，才让卖的；大台（宛平）的农民家里有铁轨的多着呢。”张同志当时就向西直门公安分所负责同志提出意见，说明这种器材不应随便买卖。过去建国铁工厂曾存有机车连杆、车门立柱、钩门铁、夹板铁等铁路器材两吨多，都由路局用废铁换了回来；这次也不应让他们把这些有用的器材当成废铁出卖。但是该所始终未作具体答复。数日后，张同志又与分所王班长联系，但王班长说：“我们已经把这事反映上去了。天津铁路管理局北京公安分处三科的陈科长说：农民可以将钢轨出卖。所以我们就让他们卖了。”
    根据以上情况，我们又到北京公安段去查问这件事。公安段邢书香同志说，他曾看到大台农民拉来一车夹板铁。他去查问时，农民拿出经北京市人民政府工商局许可出卖的证明。他曾用电话和市工商局联系，工商局的同志说知道这件事，并说：“如铁道部方面需要，可尽先卖给铁道部；否则可让农民自由买卖。”因此他就把卖铁轨的农民放走了。
    我认为：宛平县人民政府武装部、宛平县第九公安派出所、北京市人民政府工商局和北京公安段负责处理这事的同志们，没有认真协助政府搜集散失的铁路器材，没有认识到动员人民自动地把铁路器材献给国家，是他们自己应尽的责任。相反地，他们却允许农民出卖铁路器材，这是对国家财物不负责任的表现。我建议铁道部派员到宛平县及其他地区详细调查，了解当地农民保存铁路器材的情况，动员他们把器材献给国家，或由政府以适当代价购回，以杜绝国家财物的浪费，更好地建设人民的铁路。
          西直门检车所  吴祥
    编者按：早在一九四九年八月二十三日，本报曾发表前军委铁道部所制定的“搜集与保护铁路交通器材办法”，该办法号召全国军民协助各铁路局将民间保存、公私机关收藏、市场上流通的铁路交通器材，收集汇交各铁路局，以保证铁路交通的迅速恢复。宛平县武装部、第九公安派出所及北京市工商局允许人们私行买卖铁路器材，显然是违反政策的。有关方面应该进行公开检讨，并切实纠正这种现象。
