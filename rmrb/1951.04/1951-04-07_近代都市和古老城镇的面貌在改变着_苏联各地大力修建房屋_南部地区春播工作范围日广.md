Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th: TASS reports: Spring has arrived, and Soviet construction workers are entering a busy season. In Moscow, new subways and magnificent apartment buildings occupying entire blocks are being rapidly constructed. This year, the people of Moscow will gain another 710,000 square meters of living space. The appearance of major cities such as Leningrad, Kyiv, and Stalingrad is changing. Ancient Russian towns are also changing; for example, Omsk has become a huge cultural and industrial center in Siberia. Thousands of new houses have been built in the city since the war, and it now has eight universities, twenty technical schools, and four theaters. New apartments and factories are being built. The recovery work in war-torn areas has been remarkably successful. Hundreds of schools, hospitals, clubs, theaters, and apartment buildings are being constructed in the towns of Moldova. In Chișinău, the capital of Moldova, large buildings each containing 120 residences have been built for the first time. The newly built Normal School, sports field, and cinema with a capacity of one thousand people are nearing completion. The working people of Estonia have gained more than 400,000 square meters of living space since the war. Five years ago, Narva, the center of Estonia's textile industry, was a ruin, but today the residents of Narva have well-equipped houses. Similarly, in the small city of Dzaudzhikau in the North Caucasus, approximately three thousand households will move into new homes this year.

Many working people in the Soviet Union are building their own houses. The state provides working people with free housing sites and grants them long-term loans for seven to ten years. Factories and manufacturers supply them with transportation and various materials. During the five-year plan after the war, the staff of factories and institutions in Lithuania built more than four thousand houses. In Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipėda, and Šiauliai, people are building more than a thousand houses. Workers from the Minsk automobile factory, tractor factory, and other factories are also building their own houses.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th: TASS reported from Moscow on the 4th: The scope of spring planting work in the southern regions of the Soviet Union has been expanding daily. As of the 1st, many collective farms in the central states of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Volga River region had completed sowing on more than 4 million hectares of land. Collective farmers in the southern regions of Ukraine have completed the sowing of grains and are currently planting sunflowers, sugar beets, and forage grass. In Kuban, Moldova, and other regions, the sowing of wheat and barley was completed earlier than in previous years. The grain sowing work in Uzbekistan has ended, and collective farms in the Central Asian republics have planted more than 300,000 hectares of cotton. This year, all collective farms have obtained sufficient fertilizer, and machine tractor stations have also received a large amount of new equipment. Field work in the Stavropol Territory, the granary of southern Soviet Union, has been fully mechanized, and farmers in the Tselinograd and Kursk regions have used electric tractors for their work. Due to the socialist competition for the effective use of machines, tractor drivers and mechanics everywhere greatly exceed their work quotas every day, and most collective farms complete their sowing work in three or four days. Collective farms have widely applied new sowing methods, which can ensure an increase in yield of 300 to 500 kilograms per hectare.

　　近代都市和古老城镇的面貌在改变着
　  苏联各地大力修建房屋
　  南部地区春播工作范围日广
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：春天来了，苏联的建筑工人开始进入繁忙的季节。在莫斯科，新的地下铁道、占了整段马路的宏伟壮观的公寓，正在迅速建造中。今年莫斯科人民将再得到七十一万平方公尺的居住面积。列宁格勒、基辅、斯大林格勒等大都市的面貌在改变着。古老的俄罗斯城镇也在改变着，例如鄂木斯克已成为西伯利亚的巨大文化工业中心。战后该城已新建了数千座新房屋，现在已拥有八座高等学校、二十座技术学校与四座剧院。新的公寓和工厂正在修建中。曾受战争摧残的地区，恢复工作成绩卓著。摩尔达维亚的各城镇正在建设数百座学校、医院、俱乐部、剧院与公寓大厦。在摩尔达维亚的首府基希涅夫，每座拥有一百二十所住宅的大建筑物已首次建立起来。新建的师范学校、运动场、可容千人的电影院，已接近完成。爱沙尼亚的劳动人民在战后已获得四十多万平方公尺的居住面积。五年前爱沙尼亚的纺织工业中心纳瓦是一片废墟，今天纳瓦的居民已有了设备齐全的房舍了。又如北高加索的小城佳乌吉考，今年约有三千住户迁进新居。
    苏联的许多劳动人民正在建筑自己的房子。国家免费供给劳动人民以房舍基地，并贷给他们为期七年至十年的长期贷款。工厂与制造厂则供给他们运输工具与各种物资。在战后五年计划期间，立陶宛的工厂与机关的工作人员已建筑了四千多座房舍。在威尔尼阿斯、考那斯、克莱帕达与西奥里爱，人们正在建筑一千多座房舍。明斯克的汽车厂、拖拉机厂及其他工厂的工人也在建筑着自己的房子。
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：苏联南部地区的春播工作范围已日渐扩大。截至一日为止，俄罗斯联邦中央各州、乌克兰、白俄罗斯和伏尔加河区域的许多集体农场，已在四百多万公顷的土地上完成了播种工作。乌克兰南部地区的集体农民已完成谷物的播种，目前正在种植向日葵、甜菜和牧草。在库班、摩尔达维亚以及其他地区，小麦和大麦的播种工作比往年提早完成。乌兹别克的谷物播种工作已经结束，中亚细亚各共和国的集体农场已种植了三十万公顷以上的棉花。今年各集体农场都获得充分的肥料，机器拖拉机站也得到了大批新的装备。苏联南方的大谷仓斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区的田间工作已全部机械化，塞林楚克和库尔斯克两区的农民已使用了电气拖拉机进行工作。由于进行有效利用机器的社会主义竞赛，各地的拖拉机驾驶员和机工每天都大大超过他们的工作定量，大多数集体农场在三四天内就完成了播种工作。各集体农场已广泛应用了新的播种方法，这种方法可以确保每公顷土地的产量增加三百公斤到五百公斤。
