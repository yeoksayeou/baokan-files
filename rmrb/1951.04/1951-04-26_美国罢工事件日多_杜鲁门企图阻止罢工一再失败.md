Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 23rd: Strikes by American workers are becoming more and more frequent, and the government's attempts to prevent the expansion of strikes have repeatedly failed. Although the government has established a special "Wage Stabilization Board" within the system of mobilizing industry for "defense" construction in order to "resolve" labor-management disputes, the number of strikes has not only not decreased, but is also increasing. In February of this year, 600 strikes occurred in the United States, double the number in February of last year. 300,000 workers participated in the strikes, compared to 215,000 in January 1951. Seeing that the original "Wage Stabilization Board" was clearly unable to complete its task, the White House announced on April 21st that Truman had appointed a new batch of personnel to the "Wage Stabilization Board" to "resolve" disputes that "greatly threaten to disrupt work in enterprises related to national security." This new "Wage Stabilization Board" is vested with broad and full powers to "resolve labor-management disputes," i.e., to suppress strikes.

　　美国罢工事件日多
　  杜鲁门企图阻止罢工一再失败
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿二十三日讯：美国工人的罢工已愈来愈多，政府阻止罢工扩大的企图一个个都失败了。虽然，政府在动员工业建设“国防”的体系内设立了一个专门的“工资稳定局”，以“解决”劳资纠纷，但是，罢工的数目不仅没有减少，而且还在增加。今年二月间，美国发生罢工六百起，比去年二月间增加一倍。参加罢工的工人达三十万人，而一九五一年一月份则是二十一万五千人。白宫看到原来的“工资稳定局”显然不能完成它的任务，乃于四月二十一日宣布杜鲁门任命“工资稳定局”的一批新人手，以“解决”那“大有使关乎国家安全的企业中的工作紊乱之势”的纠纷。这个新的“工资稳定局”赋有“解决劳资纠纷”即镇压罢工的广泛而充分的权力。
