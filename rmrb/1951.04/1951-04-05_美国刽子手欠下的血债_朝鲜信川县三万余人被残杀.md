Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd: Evidence of the crimes committed by American aggressors in Korea is increasingly being discovered. The Korean *Rodong Sinmun* recently published a batch of materials exposing the atrocities committed by the US military in Sinbikhyon-ri, Yangyang County, Kangwon Province. American and Syngman Rhee bandits treated farmer Jang Su-an with bestial cruelty in Sinbikhyon-ri because he did not cheer for the so-called "National Defense" forces. Jang Young-an's twelve-year-old son, upon seeing this atrocity, begged the executioners not to beat his father. However, he was stabbed to death by American and Syngman Rhee soldiers with bayonets. The child's body had a total of twenty bayonet wounds. In the same village, American and Syngman Rhee beasts arrested farmer Rong Zhidu, who sympathized with the Korean People's Army, and took him to the woods, tied him to a pine tree, and sawed him to death piece by piece.

In Yangyang County alone, 3,538 residents (many of whom were women and children) were killed by American and Syngman Rhee bandits.

People learned a few days ago of new atrocities committed by American bandits in Sinchon County, Hwanghae Province. More than 35,000 Korean patriots were killed or tortured to death there. Among the corpses of the dead, many were children, women, and old people. The American beasts adopted unheard-of cruel methods in killing Korean patriots. In the central area of Sinchon County, there were two air-raid shelters. The US military drove 979 residents into these two air-raid shelters and killed them there. The US military even burned more than 200 farmers alive in a warehouse. In another warehouse, seventy children's bodies were found.

　　美国刽子手欠下的血债        
    朝鲜信川县三万余人被残杀
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社平壤讯：美国侵略者在朝鲜所犯罪行的证据，正越来越多地被发现。朝鲜《劳动新闻》最近发表了一批材料，揭露美军在江原道襄阳县新碧玄里的暴行。美国和李承晚匪徒在新碧玄里以禽兽般的残暴行为对待农民张水晏，因为他没有向所谓“国防”军的部队欢呼。张永晏的十二岁的儿子在看到这种暴行时，哀求那些刽子手不要殴打他的父亲。但是他却被美国和李承晚的士兵用刺刀活活刺死。这个小孩的尸体上共有二十处刺刀伤痕。美国和李承晚的畜生在同一村庄逮捕了同情朝鲜人民军的农民荣之度，并把他带到树林里，缚在松树上，一段一段地将他锯死。
    仅在襄阳县，就有三千五百三十八个居民（其中有许多妇女和儿童），被美国和李承晚的匪徒杀死。
    人们在几天前知道美国匪徒在黄海道信川县的新的暴行。三万五千多个朝鲜爱国者在那里被杀害或被折磨死。在死者的尸体当中，发现许多是儿童、妇女和老人。美国禽兽在杀害朝鲜爱国者时采取了闻所未闻的残忍手段。信川县中心地区有两个防空洞。美军把九百七十九个居民赶到这两个防空洞里，并在那里把他们杀死。美军更把二百多个农民活活烧死在一所货栈里。在另一所货栈里，发现七十具儿童尸体。
