Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 25th—According to returned overseas Chinese from Malaya: Based on the so-called "Manpower Mobilization Order" promulgated by the British colonial government of Malaya in January this year, the forced conscription of young overseas Chinese students into military service began in Selangor State at the end of February. As of March 8, more than 100 students from the Klang Chinese schools "Chung Hua High School," "Hua Chiaw High School," and "Hin Hua High School" had received "conscription notices." In Kuala Lumpur, twenty students from just one class, the third grade of junior high school at "Tsun Jin High School," were forcibly conscripted. The British colonial authorities are also forcibly conscripting young overseas Chinese in Perak, Johor, Negeri Sembilan, and Penang. The broad masses of young overseas Chinese students are unwilling to be cannon fodder for British imperialism and have been withdrawing from school and leaving. According to the "Manpower Mobilization Order," 20,000 young Malayans are to be conscripted into military service, and all youths aged 18 to 24 are to be registered for forced conscription at any time.
