Guangdong Xingmei Special District Public Security Department
　  Uncovers Espionage Case Involving American Church in Meixian County

　　The Public Security Department of the People's Administrative Commissioner's Office of Xingmei Special District, Guangdong Province, recently uncovered an espionage case involving the American Maryknoll Foreign Mission Society of the Catholic Church in Meixian County. This church has been engaged in espionage activities under the guise of missionary work in China for over twenty years. The spies, American Bishop Francis X. Ford and his secretary Joan Marie Ryan, have been arrested.
    The course of the case's uncovering is as follows: In November of last year, the Public Security Bureau of the Meixian County People's Government assisted the Public Security Bureaus of Huichang and Xunwu Counties in Jiangxi Province in pursuing and arresting special agents Zeng Zhonggan and local tyrant landlord Zeng Weihua, who belonged to the "Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics of the Kuomintang" system, who had fled from Gan to Mei. After several investigations, our inspectors captured the criminals in Baidu Town, Meixian County, and learned that the two had been hidden by Ford in the Catholic Church in Meixian for a month. At the same time, Pingyuan County, Guangdong Province, uncovered a case of "Crow Army" bandits (a bandit organization affiliated with the Kuomintang bandit gangs). According to the confession of the criminal Liu Rensheng, a Catholic, he joined the "Crow Army" under the instigation of Bishop Ford. Based on this, the Meixian Public Security Bureau immediately inspected the Catholic Church. As a result, they found four unregistered suspicious individuals from Yudu, Jiangxi Province, hiding in the church, including Xiao Pude, and seized copies of various intelligence reports, including military, political, highway transportation, and agricultural production information, as well as codes, that Ford had been sending to American and Japanese imperialists for over twenty years. They also found a copy of the document "Solution to the Communist Rebellion in Guangdong Province" drafted by Ford in 1948 for the Kuomintang reactionary government to be forwarded to Song Ziwen, the puppet Governor of Guangdong Province. In addition, they also seized important evidence that Ford sent the traitor Father Xu Deshen, who fled from Jining, Suiyuan, to Mei in August 1949, to Hong Kong.
    In the Meixian Diocese, Ford often used gatherings such as "prayer" to spread rumors and openly slander the People's Government, and distributed a large number of reactionary pamphlets published in Hong Kong entitled "Truth Little Series." Ford also drafted a "plan" to undermine the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Catholic Church and actively carried out sabotage activities.
    More than 150 representatives from all walks of life in Meixian County held a meeting on the 13th of this month, unanimously demanding that the People's Government arrest and bring Ford to justice. The county's public security department arrested Ford and his secretary, Li Anqing, on the 14th and brought them to justice.

　　广东兴梅专区公安部门
　  破获梅县美国教会间谍案
    广东省兴梅专区人民行政专员公署公安部门最近破获梅县天主教美国玛丽诺外方传教会的间谍案。该教会在中国以传教为掩饰进行间谍活动，已达二十余年之久。间谍分子、美籍主教福尔德（Franois. X. Ford）及其秘书黎安清（Joan. Marie Ryan）已被逮捕。
    该案破获经过如下：去年十一月间，梅县人民政府公安局，曾协助江西会昌、寻邬等县公安局追捕由赣逃梅的“国民党中央调查统计室”系统的特务分子曾忠干、恶霸地主曾维华，几经查缉，由我检查人员在梅县白渡镇将该犯等捕获，始悉该二人曾被福尔德窝藏于梅县天主堂达一月之久。与此同时，广东平远县破获“乌军”（国民党匪帮的土匪组织）土匪案一起，据案犯天主教徒刘壬生供出：他是在福尔德主教的策动下加入“乌军”的。据此，梅县公安局即行对该天主堂进行检查。结果，查出藏匿该堂未报户籍的江西雩都人、嫌疑分子萧普德等四人，并在教堂内搜出福尔德在二十几年来给美、日帝国主义递寄的包括军事、政治、公路交通、农业生产的各项情报副本、密码等件，以及一九四八年福尔德替国民党反动政府草拟的转给伪广东省主席宋子文的“广东省共乱解决办法”的文件副本。此外，还搜出福尔德在一九四九年八月间将由绥远集宁逃梅的汉奸分子许德神父送往香港的重要罪证。
    福尔德在梅县教区中，经常利用“祈祷”等集会，散布谣言，公开污蔑人民政府，并将香港出版的反动小册子《真理小丛书》大批散发。福尔德还起草了一个破坏天主教三自运动的“计划”，积极进行破坏活动。
    梅县各界人民代表一百五十余人于本月十三日举行会议，一致要求人民政府将福尔德逮捕法办。该县公安部门遂于十四日将福尔德及其秘书黎安清逮捕归案。
