Textbook Publication and Distribution Conference Concludes
Determines Principles for Autumn Textbook Publication and Distribution

In order to improve the supply of textbooks for primary and secondary schools, the People's Education Publishing House and the Xinhua Bookstore Main Store held the first National Textbook Publication Conference and Textbook Distribution Conference in Beijing from March 26 to April 3. The conference summarized the textbook publication work this spring, solved some difficult problems in textbook publication and distribution, and determined the principles for textbook publication and distribution this autumn.

Since liberation, the publication of primary and secondary school textbooks has been successful. The number of textbooks distributed has increased significantly. This spring, the distribution volume of primary and secondary school textbooks reached 110 million copies, double that of the spring of 1950. The national primary and secondary school textbook distribution agencies have effectively implemented the unified standard low-price policy, and the price of books has been reduced by half on average compared to before the War of Resistance. In Shanghai, the cost of textbooks for a third-grade primary school student accounts for only 3.5% of the total tuition and miscellaneous fees. Textbook distribution is also gradually reducing blind spots and moving towards planning. The quality of textbooks is also constantly improving. The Northeast region has adopted the translated versions of Soviet natural science textbooks. Paper and illustrations have been greatly improved.

The main problem in the supply of textbooks is untimely delivery. After studying the situation in various regions, the Textbook Publication Conference and the Textbook Distribution Conference believed that the reasons for the untimely supply of textbooks were: First, the current textbooks need to be revised every semester, which affects printing time. Second, the lack of accurate statistics on the number of students also increases the difficulty in grasping the number of textbooks to be printed. For example, after the land reform, the number of first-grade students in rural primary schools increased significantly, and the originally printed textbooks were not enough. Some areas reprinted textbooks more than ten times. Third, the unfixed school year system in various regions, with some schools starting in the spring but changing to starting in the autumn, also affects the preparation of textbooks being insufficient or excessive.

The Textbook Publication Conference determined the principles for textbook publication and supply in the future, and stipulated that textbook editing departments and cultural and educational departments should finalize the manuscripts within the specified time, production departments should deliver the goods within the specified time, and distribution departments should deliver them to the students within the specified time. Contracts should be signed with each other to clarify responsibilities. The Textbook Distribution Conference decided to strengthen the investigation and statistics work of Xinhua Bookstore branches, requiring each branch to contact cultural and educational departments and other relevant departments to grasp the statistical materials of the number of students in various regions as the basis for textbook supply.

The Textbook Publication Conference and the Textbook Distribution Conference also made specific decisions on textbook publication funds, paper, printing, and transportation. Regarding the supply of textbooks in remote and difficult-to-access areas, the Textbook Distribution Conference also decided on the delivery principle of "far before near, mountainous areas before plains." In order to gradually plan textbook distribution, the conference plans to pilot the textbook pre-order method in the North China region this autumn.

　　教科书出版发行会议闭幕
　  确定今秋课本出版发行原则
    为了改进中小学教科书供应工作，人民教育出版社和新华书店总店自三月二十六日至四月三日在北京召开了第一届全国教科书出版会议和课本发行会议。会议总结了今年春季教科书的出版工作，解决了课本出版、发行工作中的一些困难问题，并确定了今年秋季课本的出版和发行工作的原则。
    解放以来，中小学教科书的出版工作是有成绩的。教科书的发行数量有显著的增加。今年春季中小学教科书的发行量达一亿一千万册，比一九五零年春季增加了一倍。全国中小学教科书的发行机关已切实地执行了统一标准的低价政策，书价平均比抗战以前降低了一半。上海市一个小学三年级学生的课本费用只占全部学杂费的百分之三点五。教科书的发行工作也逐步地减少盲目现象，走向计划化。教科书的质量也在不断提高。东北区已采用苏联自然科学课本的翻译本。纸张、插图都有很大的改进。
    教科书供应工作中存在的问题，主要是供应不及时。教科书出版会议和课本发行会议研究了各地的情况之后，认为教科书供应不及时的原因是：第一，由于现在的教科书每学期都要修改，因而影响了印刷时间。第二，由于对学生人数缺乏精确的统计，也增加了掌握教科书印数的困难。如土地改革后，农村小学一年级的学生人数大量增加，原来印的教科书就不够用。有的地区补印教科书达十余次之多。第三，由于各地学年制不固定，有的学校是春季始业的，但他们又改为秋季始业，因此也影响教科书准备不够或准备得过多。
    教科书出版会议确定了今后教科书出版供应原则，并规定教科书编辑部门和文教部门要在规定时间内定稿，生产部门要在规定时间内发货，发行部门要在规定时间内送到学生手里。彼此订立合同，分清职责。课本发行会议决定加强新华书店各分支店的调查统计工作，要求各分支店与文教部门和其他有关部门取得联系，掌握各地学生人数的统计材料，作为教科书供应工作的依据。
    教科书出版会议和课本发行会议对教科书出版的资金、纸张、印刷、交通等问题，也作了具体的决定。关于僻远和交通困难的地区的教科书供应工作，课本发行会议也决定了“先远后近，先山区后平原”的发货原则。会议为了使教科书发行工作逐渐有计划，今年秋季准备在华北区试行课本预定办法。
