    Shanghai workers are stepping up production and actively preparing for various grand demonstration activities to welcome "May Day" Labor Day. Workers at 38 public and private steel and machinery factories in Shanghai are manufacturing floodgates and various components for flood control along the Huai River, with selfless labor enthusiasm, to support the people on both sides of the Huai River in their summer flood prevention efforts. Model workers at the No. 1 Factory of the China Textile Machinery Company completed their original six-day production task of manufacturing hydraulic piston cylinders in two and a half days. Dozens of factories, including the Shanghai Vehicle Manufacturing Factory and the Shanghai Oil Refinery, are also offering "May Day" gifts by completing production tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas. After improving labor organization, the maintenance department of the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory reduced the time for flat car operations from 60 hours to 50 hours, then to 40 hours, and finally created a new national record of 28 hours for large flat car operations on Toyota automatic looms. After launching a labor competition to welcome "May Day," the privately-owned Anda Yarn Factory not only maintained the grade A quality of 20-count yarn for a month but also improved the quality of 32-count yarn, which was generally considered impossible to improve with existing raw materials, from grade B to grade A.

    To welcome the "May Day" grand demonstration parade, workers in various factories are rushing to make slogans, cartoon signs, and various charts to illustrate the new production records, improved product quality, and raw material savings created by the workers in their respective factories. Employees of companies and stores on the city's busiest streets, such as Nanjing Road and Huaihai Road, are working overnight to renovate and arrange publicity display windows. Workers' security teams in various factories are strengthening the protection of factory safety and actively preparing to participate in the "May Day" grand demonstration parade. (Xinhua News Agency)
    To welcome "May Day" International Labor Day, advanced producers in Harbin collectively responded to the call from labor models in Shenyang to strengthen patriotic current affairs education and deeply promote patriotic labor competitions, and challenged all labor models in the city and Songjiang Province. The aforementioned call from labor models in Shenyang was made at a symposium of labor models convened by the Northeast Daily on March 29. The advanced producers in Harbin who participated in this competition included well-known labor models from Harbin's public enterprises, advanced production team leaders, factory directors, model trade union chairmen, and well-known labor models from private factories.

    The competition conditions of each advanced producer are all permeated with a central idea: to take patriotic education as the driving force, and to promote the labor competition in enterprises in Harbin and Songjiang Province towards a regularized direction with the improvement of technology and systems as the main methods. Therefore, on the one hand, each advanced producer regards striving to study current affairs and politics, popularizing patriotic propaganda for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and welcoming the "May Day" grand demonstration as the first item of the competition conditions; on the other hand, they all propose to improve product quality and output from learning advanced experience and improving technology and systems. Advanced production teams such as Man Shushan, Tian Yupiu, Chi Guizhen, and Jin Guozhu have all put forward plans to learn advanced experience. The method adopted by the Man Shushan team is to carry out competitions between mutual aid groups, go to work ten minutes early, check tools, do a good job of preparation, and strictly implement the handover inspection system for front and rear processes to ensure that the product quality qualification rate of each process in the 72 processes reaches 100%. In this way, the content of these competition plans is closely integrated with the large-scale product quality inspection that will be launched locally in May and June. In terms of increasing output, advanced producers have also proposed plans to ensure that the second quarter production tasks are completed on time or ahead of schedule. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　迎接“五一”国际劳动节
　  上海工人积极生产筹备大示威
　  哈尔滨市先进生产者集体响应沈阳劳动模范竞赛号召
    上海市工人正加紧生产，积极筹备大示威的各种活动，以迎接“五一”劳动节。上海三十八家公私营钢铁机器厂工人，为支援淮河两岸人民做好夏季防汛工作，正以忘我的劳动热情制造着淮河中游防洪水闸的闸门和各种机件。中国纺织机械公司第一厂的模型工人接到制造油压活塞筒的任务后，已在二天半内完成原定六天的生产任务。上海制车厂、上海炼油厂等数十个工厂并以提前及超额完成生产任务来作为“五一”节的献礼。国营上海第一棉纺厂保全部改进劳动组织后，平车时间由六十小时减至五十小时、四十小时，最后又以二十八小时创造了丰田式自动织布机大平车的全国新纪录。私营安达纱厂为迎接“五一”节展开劳动竞赛后，一月来不但保持了二十支纱甲级的品质，并将一般认为根据现有原料无法提高的三十二支纱的品质，从乙级提高到甲级。
    为迎接“五一”大示威游行，各工厂工人正在赶制用以说明各该厂工人创造生产新纪录，提高产品质量，节约原料等情况的标语牌、漫画牌及各种图表。南京路、淮海路等全市最热闹街道上的公司、商店的职员，正在连夜整顿和布置宣传橱窗。各工厂工人纠察队正加强护卫工厂安全，并积极进行参加“五一”大示威游行的准备工作。    （新华社）
    哈尔滨市先进生产者为迎接“五一”国际劳动节，集体响应沈阳市劳动模范关于加强爱国主义时事教育、深入开展爱国主义劳动竞赛的号召，并向该市及松江省全体劳动模范挑战。沈阳市劳动模范的上述号召，是在三月二十九日东北日报社召集的劳动模范座谈会上提出的。哈尔滨市参加这一竞赛的先进生产者，有哈市公营企业中的著名劳动模范、先进的生产小组组长、工厂厂长和模范工会主席，还有私营工厂中的著名劳动模范。
    在各先进生产者的竞赛条件中，都贯串着一个中心思想：就是要以爱国主义教育为动力，以改进技术和制度为主要方法，推动哈尔滨市和松江省各企业中的劳动竞赛向经常化的方向发展。因此，各先进生产者一方面都把努力学习时事、政治，普及抗美援朝的爱国主义宣传，迎接“五一”大示威，列为竞赛条件的第一项，另一方面都提出要从学习先进经验、改进技术和制度中，来达到提高产品质量和产量的目的。满树山、田玉璞、迟桂珍、金国珠等先进生产小组都提出了学习先进经验的计划。满树山小组采取的办法是：开展互助小组之间的竞赛，提前十分钟上班，检查工具，做好准备工作，严格执行前后工序的交接检查制，以保证在七十二道工序中每道工序的制品质量合格率都达到百分之百。这样，这些竞赛计划的内容，就和当地五、六月份即将展开的产品质量大检查密切结合起来。在提高产量方面，各先进生产者也都提出了保证按时或提前完成第二季度生产任务的计划。
