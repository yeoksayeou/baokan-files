    Granny Yao Catches a Spy
    By Miao Di and Zhao Zhifang

    (4) Therefore, Granny Yao paid close attention to this matter. She instructed Shi Jintong, who was in charge of the gate keys: "You must be careful with the gate, and the opening and closing times must be fixed. Don't give the key to anyone at other times. If anyone disagrees, give me a message."

    (5) She also ran to tell Granny Zhang: "It's best not to easily lend your back door to others! Do you know about the Yang family's affairs? If you let him run away secretly, you'll have to bear the responsibility!" Granny Yao knew that the Zhang family was honest, so she gave them another warning before leaving: "No matter who begs you, don't let them through!"

    (6) From then on, Granny Yao began to interact with the Yang family, sometimes chatting casually, sometimes teaching the old woman of the Yang family how to twist hemp rope. Every time she went, she paid attention to the situation in their home; sometimes she would also chat with Yang Fazhang.

    （四）因此，姚大娘就很留意这件事，她嘱咐管大门钥匙的史金桐：“你要仔细门户，早晚开关要有定时，别的时候谁要钥匙，可千万别给。谁要不答应，就告诉我一个信息。”
    （五）她又跑去告诉张四奶奶：“你家后门最好不要轻易给人借光啊！你知道杨家的事儿不？你要偷着让他跑了，这个错你可得担啊！”姚大娘知道张家人老实，因此在走之前又叮嘱一番：“不管有谁怎样央求你，可也别放过啊！”
    （六）从此，姚大娘开始接触杨家，有时去闲聊天，有时去教杨家老太婆搓麻绳。每次去，她都注意他们家的情形；有时也和杨法章搭讪两句。
