Short Commentary

	Emphasize the Opinions of the People
	Today, this column publishes two letters from the Beijing Municipal People's Government in response to readers' letters. The Beijing Municipal People's Government has conducted a serious investigation and study of the readers' letters, adopted the opinions that can be implemented with an extremely responsible spirit, and also made a serious reply to the suggestions that cannot be realized at present. This spirit of being responsible to the people is good.
	The phenomenon of not paying attention to the opinions of the masses still exists seriously in some government agencies. According to the statistics of this newspaper from March 7th to 16th, among the farmers who came to this newspaper from various parts of Hebei to talk, seventeen people came because the local county and district people's governments did not accept or had long-term backlog of their problems. Therefore, it is worthy of attention and learning from all regions that the Beijing Municipal People's Government attaches importance to handling the people's opinions and uses public replies to solve various problems among the masses.
	We suggest that the people's governments at all levels should universally establish special agencies, or appoint specific personnel to handle the opinions raised by the people to the government, reply to the people's letters, and receive the people in the most convenient way. In this way, the people's government can greatly strengthen its ties with the masses of the people.

### 重视人民的意见

专栏：短评

　　重视人民的意见
    本栏今天发表了北京市人民政府答复读者的两封来信。北京市人民政府对读者来信进行了认真的调查和研究，以极其负责的精神，采纳了可以实行的意见，对目前还不能实现的建议，也作了严肃的答复。这种对人民负责的精神是好的。
    不重视群众意见的现象，在某些政府机关中目前还是严重地存在着。据本报三月七日至十六日的统计，仅由河北各地来本报谈话的农民中，就有十七个人是因当地县、区人民政府不受理或长期积压他们的问题而来的。因此，北京市人民政府重视处理人民意见并用公开答复方式来解决群众中的各种问题，是值得各地重视和学习的。
    我们建议各级人民政府应普遍建立专门机关，或确定专人来处理人民向政府所提出的意见，答复人民的来信，并用最方便的办法接见人民。这样，人民政府就可以大大密切与人民群众的联系。
