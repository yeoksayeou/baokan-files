    Beiyang Paper Mill Illegally Dismisses Trade Union Cadres;
    Relevant Leading Organs in Beijing Should Investigate and Handle This

    To the Editor:

    The Beiyang Paper Mill, a privately-owned factory in Beijing's 12th District, has been using work stoppages as a means to illegally dismiss trade union cadres and activists. This has caused widespread dissatisfaction among the workers in Beijing's machine-made paper industry.

    The Beiyang Paper Mill suffered severe damage from the Kuomintang bandit gang in the past. After liberation, with the active construction of the workers, it resumed work in September 1949. In March 1950, due to sluggish sales of paper products, most of the paper mills in Beijing stopped work; the factory's production also stagnated. To help the capitalist overcome difficulties, the workers reduced their wages by 50 percent during the shutdown. By June of that year, sales improved, and the paper mills resumed production one after another; however, the shareholders of the Beiyang Paper Mill were unwilling to invest, and the factory remained closed. The factory dragged on until August and September, when the capitalist intended to dismiss twenty-eight workers who directly participated in production. After arbitration by the Labor Bureau, the capitalist gave the workers one and a half months' severance pay. After the arbitration decision was issued, manager Bai Xiusheng sarcastically said to Li Fusheng, the chairman of the trade union: "This time, the Labor Bureau is calling the shots for you, right? If you are not satisfied, go to court! If I were the chairman of the trade union, I would have jumped into the latrine and died long ago. How can you still have the face to collect severance pay?" When worker representative Tian Jun went to the factory to collect severance pay, the manager held a roast chicken in one hand and a wine glass in the other, and said to him triumphantly: "You have such a strong personality, let's see where you can be strong this time? Being strong still requires severance pay!?" Not long after this group of workers was dismissed, the capitalist began to repair the factory, and officially resumed work in December. The dismissed workers requested reinstatement, but the capitalist refused. Later, after mediation by the Labor Bureau, the capitalist allowed thirteen of the twenty-eight dismissed workers to be reinstated. This clearly exposed the capitalist's conspiracy: none of the thirteen reinstated workers were former trade union committee members or group leaders; among the fifteen workers who were not allowed to be reinstated, two were members of the Beijing Paper Industry Trade Union, seven were members of the factory's trade union committee, one was a labor-capital consultation representative, one was a trade union group leader, and the rest were activists in the trade union. However, the factory hired four workers from the Tianjin-Hebei Paper Mill due to insufficient manpower. Obviously, the actions of the capitalist of the Beiyang Paper Mill were a planned effort to squeeze out trade union cadres and activists. I think this issue should attract the serious attention of the government and the trade union.

    Editor's Note: The capitalist of the Beiyang Paper Mill dismissed and attacked trade union cadres and activists by means of work stoppages, which is a violation of the Trade Union Law. The relevant leading organs should investigate and handle this matter. The Beijing Labor Bureau should strengthen its investigation and research when handling this issue. Since the factory has the ability to resume production, it should not approve its large-scale dismissal of workers.

### 北洋造纸厂非法解雇工会干部  北京市有关领导机关应检查处理

    北洋造纸厂非法解雇工会干部
    北京市有关领导机关应检查处理编辑同志：
    北京市十二区私营北洋造纸厂资方以停工为手段，非法解雇工会干部和积极分子，这件事已引起北京市机器造纸业工人的普遍不满。
    北洋造纸厂过去曾遭受国民党匪帮的严重破坏。解放后在工人积极修建下，于一九四九年九月复工。一九五○年三月，因造纸业产品滞销，北京的造纸厂大部停工；该厂生产也陷于停滞状态。为协助资方度过困难，工人在停工期间减少工资百分之五十。至当年六月间，产品销路情况好转，各纸厂纷纷恢复生产；但北洋纸厂股东不肯投资，仍未开工。拖延至八、九月间，资方要把二十八个直接参加生产的工人遣散。后经劳动局仲裁，资方给工人一个半月的遣散费。仲裁书发下来后，经理白秀生讽刺工会主任李福生说：“这回劳动局可给你们作主了吧？你们不服就到法院告去呀！我要是工会主任，早就栽到尿罐里死去了。你还有脸来拿遣散费。”工人代表田俊到厂拿遣散费时，经理一手提着烧鸡，一手拿着酒杯，神气十足地对他说：“你那么刚强的个性，看你这回到那儿刚强去？刚强还要遣散费！？”这批工人被遣散不久，资方即着手修理工厂，十二月又正式开工。被遣散的工人要求复工，资方拒绝了。后来经过劳动局调解，资方允许在被遣散的二十八个工人中挑十三名复工。这就明显地暴露了资方的阴谋：在复工的十三个工人中，没有一个是以前的工会委员或小组长；不让复工的十五个工人中则有两个是北京市造纸业工会委员、七个是该厂工会委员、一个是劳资协商代表、一个是工会小组长、其余都是工会中的积极分子。但该厂却因为人力不足，在天津河北造纸厂雇来了四个工人。很明显，北洋造纸厂资方这种举动是有计划地排挤工会干部和积极分子。我认为这问题应该引起政府和工会的严重注意。

    编者按：北洋造纸厂资方以停工为手段，解雇和打击工会干部及积极分子，是违背工会法的行为。有关领导机关应该调查处理。北京市劳动局在处理这个问题上，应加强调查研究。该厂既有复工生产的能力，就不应批准他大批解雇工人。
