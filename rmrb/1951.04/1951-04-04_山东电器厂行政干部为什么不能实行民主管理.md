To the Editor:

Since liberation, the publicly owned Shandong Electric Appliance Factory has made considerable progress in production and has also carried out certain democratic reforms in its management system. However, it is not satisfactory in truly implementing democratic management and relying on the working class to run the people's enterprise well.

Since the establishment of the Democratic Management Committee in the factory, it has not been functioning for a long time. The Management Committee was originally scheduled to meet once every three months, but it has not met for the past six months. Why does the Management Committee not convene on schedule? The reason given by some leading comrades is: "There is no work." They believe that worker representatives cannot raise any important opinions at the Management Committee meetings. When workers request to discuss the production plan, some administrative leaders say with indifference: "Okay, give them the drawings (meaning that the workers do not understand the drawings and the discussion is useless)!" Some say: "Forget it, what do they know!" These comrades have forgotten that the functions of the Factory Management Committee are: "...to discuss and decide on all major issues related to production and management, such as production plans, business operations, management systems, production organization, personnel appointments and removals, wages and welfare, etc., based on the production plans and various instructions stipulated by the higher-level enterprise leadership organs, combined with the actual situation of the factory, and to regularly check and summarize the work." If the leading cadres of the factory can humbly and sincerely put various major issues in the factory to the Management Committee for discussion, do the workers really not understand? The facts are not like this at all. In production, our factory's employees have made many inventions and innovations in the past year. For example, worker Zhu Xiquan has transformed the thread rolling machine, increasing work efficiency by nearly thirty times. Wu Pinxiang has transformed the shear machine, increasing efficiency by three times. When forging anti-climbing devices, forger Li Ziheng used his spare time to learn new methods from other factories, increasing efficiency by more than double. Some leading cadres in our factory have failed to deeply recognize the importance of relying on the working class from such facts, and still seriously show that they do not value the opinions of the working masses and do not care about the workers. I have criticized some shortcomings in the work of our factory twice in the People's Daily in Beijing and the Dazhong Daily in Shandong, but the leading cadres of our factory have failed to seriously examine and correct them.

The safety equipment in the material preparation room of the battery department of our factory is very poor, and the room is filled with dust. One-third of the chemical workers working here have fallen ill in the past six months. Although workers, the trade union, and the general branch of the Communist Party have repeatedly suggested that the administration install ventilation equipment, it has not been resolved.

The attitude of the leading cadres of our factory towards temporary workers is also extremely wrong: temporary workers only have four catties of coarse grain as wages per day. When workers complained that it was not enough to live on, some administrative leaders said: "If you think it's too little, you don't have to do it. There are plenty of workers!" Later, the provincial-level leading organs stipulated that temporary workers should be absorbed as formal workers after working continuously for six months. The leading cadres of our factory did not correctly implement the regulations, but wrongly said: "That doesn't matter, we will dismiss the short-term workers after they have worked for five months."

I hope they will seriously examine and improve on this.

Worker of Shandong Electric Appliance Factory Wang Huihua

Editor's note: Worker Wang Huihua has repeatedly criticized the bureaucratic style of some administrative leaders of Shandong Electric Appliance Factory in newspapers for not believing in the power of the working masses, not relying on the working class, and not conscientiously implementing democratic management. According to Wang Huihua's letter, the leading cadres of the factory have not conducted in-depth reviews and practical improvements on their shortcomings. It is hoped that the administrative leaders of the electric appliance factory will seriously conduct a review.

### 山东电器厂行政干部为什么不能实行民主管理

专栏：工厂来信

　　山东电器厂行政干部为什么不能实行民主管理编辑同志：
    公营山东电器厂自解放以后，生产上获得不少成绩，在管理制度上，也进行了一定的民主改革；但对于真正实行民主管理，依靠工人阶级办好人民企业这一点，作得是不能令人满意的。
    厂里自成立民主管理委员会以来，长时期不起作用。管委会原定期三个月开会一次，而最近半年一直未开会。管委会为什么不按期召开呢？某些领导同志的理由是：“没有工作。”他们认为工人代表在管委会会议上提不出什么重要意见。工人要求讨论生产计划，有的行政领导干部则带理不理地说：“好吧，把图纸交给他们（意即工人不懂图纸，讨论也无用）！”有的则说：“算拉吧，懂得啥呀！”这些同志忘记了工厂管理委员会的职权是：“……根据上级企业领导机关规定之生产计划及各种指示，结合本厂实际情况，讨论与决定一切有关生产及管理的重大问题，如生产计划、业务经营、管理制度、生产组织、人事任免、工资福利问题等，并定期检查与总结工作”。如果厂里的领导干部能够虚心诚意地把厂内各种重大问题放在管委会上讨论，工人真的不懂吗？事实完全不是这样的。在生产上，我厂职工一年来有很多发明创造。如工人朱锡泉改造了搓丝机，提高工作效率近三十倍。吴品香改造了剪刀机，提高效率三倍。锻工李子恒在打防爬器时，自己利用业余时间到别厂学习了新办法，提高效率一倍多。我厂某些领导干部未能从类似这样的事实中，深刻认识到依靠工人阶级的重要性，仍然严重地表现着对工人群众的意见不重视，对工人不关心。我对我厂工作中的一些缺点，曾两次在北京人民日报及山东大众日报上进行批评，我厂领导干部均未能认真地检查和纠正。
    我厂电池部制料间安全设备很差，尘土飞扬满屋，在此处工作的化学工人半年来有三分之一病倒。对此，虽经工人、工会、中共党总支等屡次建议行政装置通风设备，却一直未予解决。
    我厂领导干部对临时工人的态度也是极端错误的：临时工人每天只有四斤粗粮的工资，工人提出不够生活，有的行政领导干部则说：“嫌少可以不干，有的是工人！”后来省级领导机关规定：临时工连续工作六个月时，得吸收为正式工人。我厂领导干部不是正确执行规定，却错误地说：“那不要紧，短工干到五个月我们就辞退。”
    对此，我希望他们能认真地进行检查和改进。
                                        山东电器厂工人  王辉华
    编者按：工人王辉华对山东电器厂某些行政领导干部不相信工人群众的力量，不依靠工人阶级，不认真实行民主管理的官僚主义作风，曾在报纸上一再提出批评。现据王辉华来信，该厂领导干部对自己的缺点尚未进行深入的检讨和切实的改进。希望电器厂的行政领导干部，认真进行检讨。
