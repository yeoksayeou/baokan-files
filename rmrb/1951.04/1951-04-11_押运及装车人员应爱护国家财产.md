Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editorial Department:

After your newspaper published Comrade Liu Wankui's suggestion "Transportation Departments Should Strengthen Rain Protection Equipment" in the Readers' Letters column on March 13, our bureau immediately sent people to Guang'anmen Station to understand the situation and, together with the station master and relevant responsible comrades, visited Comrade Liu Wankui of the China National Cereals Corporation. We are now informing you of the situation and our opinions on this matter:

(1) The railway department does not handle consignment business for full carload goods, so it is not responsible for the loss of goods. However, the dispatch station has the obligation to conduct detailed research with the consignor or provide guidance on the loading and covering of goods. Some of our stations have not done enough in this regard.

(2) The twelve carloads of red sorghum transported from the Northeast to Beijing were only covered with a layer of reed mats, causing snow water to seep in. According to Article 35 of the Railway Freight Transport Regulations: The escorting person must ride in the vehicle carrying the goods for safekeeping. However, the escorting person for these twelve carloads of red sorghum did not comply with this provision, so no one noticed when the snow water seeped in.

(3) We believe that Comrade Liu's suggestion on how to load goods in open wagons (piling the goods into a ridge shape, covering them with grass sacks or burlap bags, and then covering them with four layers of reed mats) is very good, and we are preparing to study and promote its implementation. We deeply thank Comrade Liu Wankui for his spirit of cherishing national property and caring for the people's railway cause.

### 押运及装车人员应爱护国家财产

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　押运及装车人员应爱护国家财产编辑同志：
    三月十三日，贵报读者来信栏刊登刘万魁同志建议“运输部门应加强防雨设备”一信后，我局当日即派人到广安门车站了解情况，并会同该站站长及有关负责同志访问了中国粮食公司刘万魁同志。现将这件事情的情况及我们的意见告诉给你们：
    （一）铁道部门对整车货物尚未办理托运业务，因此对货物的损失不能负责。但发货站对货物装车覆盖等，有与运货人作详细研究或予以指导的义务。我们某些车站在这一点上是做的不够的。
    （二）由东北运北京的十二车红粮，由于在车面上只盖有一层芦席，致渗入雪水。根据铁路货物运送规则第三十五条规定：押运人须乘坐其装货的车辆，以便保管。但这十二车红粮的押运人却没有遵照此项规定，所以雪水渗入后，也无人发现。
    （三）刘同志建议对无棚货车装货的方法（将货物堆成屋脊形，上面覆盖草袋或麻袋，再加盖四层芦席），我们认为很好，正准备加以研究推广实行。刘万魁同志爱护国家资财及关心人民铁道事业的精神，我们深致谢意。
