In response to the call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America, Aid Korea, the Chinese Educational Workers' Union Beijing Committee, in order to continue to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, jointly issued a notice with the Municipal Student Union on March 28, deciding that teachers, staff, workers, and students of all schools should closely connect and unify their actions in the future. On the 29th and 30th, the University and Middle School Cultural and Educational Work Conference and Primary School Cadre Conference were held respectively, conveying the notice and determining specific work plans.

The Cultural and Educational Work Conference first summarized the past experiences in carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement among school teachers and staff, and the trade unions of Yanjing, Tsinghua, Huiwen, and Men's No. 1 Middle School reported on their experiences in conducting current affairs studies and accusation meetings. It was pointed out that the movement in the schools was uneven and not widespread in the past. Many schools and some teachers and students have not received education in the movement or received very little education. The teachers who participated in the propaganda work are still in the minority. At the same time, the movement in the schools in the past was not deep enough. Ideological recollection meetings and accusation meetings were only held in a few schools, and the enthusiasm for current affairs study was generally not well consolidated. To this end, the meeting believed that it is first necessary to strengthen the current affairs study of teachers, staff, and students, and widely use ideological recollection and accusation meetings to accuse the crimes of the United States, Japan, and counter-revolutionaries, and to recall the past and compare the present to stimulate patriotism and improve understanding. At the same time, do a good job of the strong leading the weak, and public schools helping private schools, so that the propaganda and education of Resist America, Aid Korea is first popularized to every teacher, staff member and student in each school, and then deepened, so that the study of current affairs becomes a regular system. Teachers in all schools should conduct patriotic education on Resist America, Aid Korea for students in a planned way through teaching. Primary and secondary schools can also use morning meetings and weekly meetings to explain current affairs to students. During the spring vacation, teachers, staff, and students of all schools should organize small propaganda teams, exhibitions, and other diverse forms to conduct propaganda and education for nearby citizens and farmers. After the spring vacation, the propaganda and education work of Resist America, Aid Korea will be regularized. The propaganda targets of primary school teachers are mainly children and parents. Parent meetings can be widely held to carry out propaganda work. Children can carry out patriotic education through the activities of young pioneers. On the basis of patriotic ideology, combined with the specific conditions of each school, teachers and students jointly formulate patriotic covenants to consolidate and enhance patriotic enthusiasm and understanding. In mid-April, the Municipal Education Union and the Municipal Student Union will jointly convene a city-wide conference of education workers and student representatives to exchange experiences in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, and formulate a patriotic covenant for education workers and students throughout the city.

　　北京大中学文教工作会议及小学干部大会
　  确定普及深入抗美援朝运动的具体计划
　  为普及抗美援朝运动而斗争
    中国教育工会北京市委员会为响应中国人民抗美援朝总会的号召，继续普及与深入抗美援朝运动，曾在三月二十八日，和市学生联合会联合发出通知，决定今后各校教师、职员、工友和学生应密切联系，统一行动步骤。并在二十九、三十两日分别召开大、中学文教工作会议及小学干部大会，传达了通知和确定了具体工作计划。
    文教工作会议首先总结了过去在学校教职员中开展抗美援朝运动的经验，并由燕京、清华、汇文、男一中等校工会报告了进行时事学习和控诉会的经验。指出过去运动在学校中是开展得不平衡不普及的，有不少学校和一部分教师和学生没有受到运动的教育或受到教育很少。参加宣传工作的教师还是少数。同时过去运动在学校中还不够深入，联系思想的回忆会控诉会只是在少数学校举行过，时事学习的热忱一般没有很好地巩固起来。为此，会议认为首先应加强教职员工和学生的时事学习，广泛利用思想回忆和控诉会等方式，控诉美、日和反革命分子的罪行，和回忆过去，比较现在，以激发爱国热情和提高认识。同时做好强的带动弱的，公立学校帮助私立学校，使得抗美援朝的宣传教育首先普及到每个学校的每个教职员工和学生，再深入下去，使时事学习成为经常的制度。各校教师应通过教学有计划地对学生进行抗美援朝爱国主义的教育，中小学还可用朝会周会等时间对学生讲解时事。各校教职员工与学生在春假期间组织小型宣传队，展览会等多样的方式，对附近市民和农民进行宣传教育。春假以后则使抗美援朝的宣传教育工作变成经常化。小学教师宣传对象主要为儿童和家长，可普遍召开家长会，进行宣传工作，儿童们可通过少年儿童队的活动来进行爱国主义的教育。在爱国主义思想基础上，结合各校具体情况，师生共同订立爱国公约，以巩固并提高爱国的热情和认识。四月中旬，市教育工会和市学生联合会将联合召开全市教育工作者和学生代表大会，交流抗美援朝运动经验，并制订全市教育工作者和学生的爱国公约。
