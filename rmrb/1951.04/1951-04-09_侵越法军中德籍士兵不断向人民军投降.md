Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th. Sixty-nine Germans who, responding to the call of the government of the German Democratic Republic, withdrew from the French war of aggression against Vietnam and surrendered to the Vietnamese People's Army, have recently arrived in the German Democratic Republic from Vietnam and will participate in peaceful construction work in Democratic Germany. At a press conference held by the Berlin News Office on April 4, these Germans, who had defected from the French Foreign Legion in the war of aggression against Vietnam, said that the appeal issued by the government of the German Democratic Republic on February 3 this year, calling on German soldiers to abandon the French war of aggression against Vietnam and surrender to the Vietnamese People's Army, had a great impact on German soldiers in the French Foreign Legion, and the number of German soldiers surrendering to the People's Army is constantly increasing.

They also described how Western youth were dragged into the criminal war of aggression against Vietnam by the Western occupation authorities and their Bonn accomplices. A former Foreign Legion soldier named Grotte used his personal experience to describe the situation in West Germany where the French were recruiting Foreign Legion soldiers. He said: "Throughout West Germany, there are recruitment offices everywhere, and even sixteen-year-old teenagers are recruited. These forcibly recruited soldiers are sent to North Africa for training. They live in extremely inhumane conditions, with each person allowed no more than a quarter of a liter of water per day for drinking and washing. If they are discovered trying to escape, they will be severely punished. These forcibly recruited German soldiers are sent to Vietnam and equipped with American weapons. There are also American officers in their units to supervise them. All Foreign Legion soldiers are ordered to take brutal measures against the Vietnamese people."

Another former Foreign Legion soldier, Dutschke, described the preferential treatment they received from the Vietnamese people after surrendering to the People's Army. German soldiers who had already surrendered to the People's Army also tried to mobilize German soldiers who had not yet left the French colonial army to surrender to the People's Army.

　　侵越法军中德籍士兵不断向人民军投降
    【新华社柏林八日电】在德意志民主共和国政府号召下退出法国侵越战争、投向越南人民军的德国人六十九人，最近从越南到达德意志民主共和国，并将在民主德国参加和平建设工作。在柏林新闻处在四月四日举行的记者招待会上，这些脱离了法国侵越战争的德国人说：德意志民主共和国政府今年二月三日号召德籍士兵脱离法国侵越战争投向越南人民军的呼吁书，对侵越法军外籍兵团中德籍士兵的影响很大，德籍士兵投向人民军的人数正不断增加。
    他们并叙述西德青年被西方占领当局和它们的波恩帮凶拉进罪恶的侵越战争的情形。一个名叫哥罗特的前外籍兵团士兵用他亲身的经验叙述西德替法国招募外籍兵团士兵的情况。他说：“在整个西德。到处设有招兵处，甚至十六岁的少年人都被招去了。这些被强迫招募来的士兵被送往北非训练。他们在极不人道的条件下生活，每天每人用水，连喝带洗不得超过四分之一公升。企图逃跑如被发觉，就要受到严厉的惩罚。这些被强迫招募来的德籍士兵被送到越南后，就用美国武器装备起来。在他们的部队里还有美国军官做他们的监督。所有的外籍兵团士兵都奉命对越南人民采取暴戾的措施。”
    另外一个前外籍兵团士兵杜赤克叙述了他们在投向人民军后受到越南人民优待的情形。已经投向人民军的德籍士兵还设法动员还没有脱离法国殖民军的德籍士兵投到人民军方面来。
