A Theme Urgently Awaiting Expression - Suppressing Counterrevolutionaries
    Liu Enqi
    How literature and art should coordinate with the current political struggle task of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, how to express the theme of the national people's struggle against the remaining counter-revolutionary elements, and the theme of suppressing bandits and eliminating secret agents, is a serious and urgent task placed before writers and all literary and art workers.
    I think no one would say now that this theme is not worth expressing. Because the problem is becoming more and more obvious: the Kuomintang reactionaries, the running dogs of imperialism, and their accomplices will never be reconciled to death just because their rule has been overthrown, but are using every possible means to counterattack the people ferociously at all times. They attempt to sabotage anti-American aid to Korea, land reform, production and construction, and various mass movements. Under such circumstances, it is a political education that must be carried out among the people of the whole country at present to make the masses of the people and cadres maintain vigilance against hidden enemies at all times, to recognize what harm the enemies have done to the motherland and the people, why they must be suppressed, and how everyone should assist the government in suppressing counter-revolutionary activities.
    On the front lines of suppressing bandits and eliminating secret agents, there are too many things that need to be expressed.
    Here I would like to cite some heroic achievements in the struggle to suppress bandits and eliminate secret agents. Of course, these are fragments and not enough to explain the entire content of this great struggle. After liberation, Zhejiang Province suffered from serious banditry for a long time. The masses feared bandits as tigers and wolves and did not dare to rise up to fight. However, when the people's government implemented the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and executed a group of counter-revolutionary elements, the local armed militia of men and women greatly developed. Guard posts and sentries were strictly checked, and the actions of bandits and secret agents became difficult. In the past two months, most of the secret agents who sneaked in from the coast were found by the militia. A female militiaman cleverly captured the commander of a bandit secret agent detachment of the Chiang bandits; an important secret agent held two guns and resisted arrest, and was heavily surrounded by thousands of militiamen and was finally captured. The Hang County militia surrounded and captured a group of bandits. In one day, the militia increased from dozens of people to three thousand people, and finally wiped out the bandits. When the masses in Changle, Fujian, heard that Kuomintang armed secret agents had sneaked into the mainland from the sea, the signal was sounded, and several village militias immediately assembled to search and capture them. Most of the defeated bandits were captured by the militia. An old woman in Guangxi led a militia team to capture more than a dozen bandits alive. Farmers in Jiangxi captured the big bandit leader who had been hunted for a long time. In January, farmers in Hunan Province assisted the government in cracking more than 100 cases of secret agent "underground army" conspiracy riots in one month.
    Every march and victory of the People's Liberation Army in suppressing bandits, and every investigation and cracking of counter-revolutionary cases by the People's Public Security Organs, provide our writers with rich and vivid materials.
    The people praise and sing the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. They regard whether or not they can "control the counter-revolutionaries" as an important key to whether or not they can turn themselves over (or whether the turn over can be consolidated). In places where the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is not resolute enough and bandits, secret agents, and local tyrants run rampant, the masses say: "The whole country is liberated, but it is still dark here!" "If the government doesn't kill the counter-revolutionaries, I won't dare to ask for land even if it is distributed!" After resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the people raise their eyebrows and cheer and support, and dare to rise up to fight. After Fujian executed a group of counter-revolutionary elements, the farmers said: "Land reform and land distribution is the first time to turn over, participating in farmers' associations and having a place to speak is the second time to turn over, and eradicating little Chiang Kai-shek is the third time to turn over; three turns and three successes, great happiness." When Tan Weishi, the evil tyrant and bandit leader in Wanxian, eastern Sichuan, was shot, people from all over came from afar to participate. They said: "If we don't watch him being shot, we can't feel relieved to reduce rent and return deposits!" The families of the victims pointed to the portrait of Chairman Mao and said: "We can finally have our revenge!" In many other areas, after suppressing counter-revolutionary elements, farmers killed chickens and ducks to worship their ancestors, and the whole village held banquets and sang peaceful operas to celebrate warmly. Some even wrote their own kuaiban and performed their own operas to sing about victory. For example, after Suiyuan suppressed a group of counter-revolutionary elements in January and February, the people around Jining sang: "Years of grievances have been avenged in one day, and many days of suffering have been eliminated in one day!" After Chen Yongling, the evil tyrant and bandit leader in Sichuan and Guizhou, was executed in the Southwest, a few self-composed ballads circulated among the farmers:
      For thirty years,
      Officials and soldiers are like combs,
      Bandits are like lice,
      Security teams are like razors...
      Such days will never return!
    These short sentences contain so much hatred and anger towards the Kuomintang reactionaries and their counter-revolutionary pawns, and love and praise for today's good life!
    The people have already praised and cheered for removing the "big stones," "local tigers," and "local snakes" (as the people describe bandits, local tyrants, and secret agents) from their hearts! Can our writers and literary and art workers remain silent?
    The people demand the resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, the people also demand that literary and art workers create literary and artistic works that praise the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, just as they demand praise for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and production and construction. The people are by no means satisfied with simply publishing a few news items about cracking or executing counter-revolutionary criminals in the newspaper. The people demand to expose the conspiracies and crimes of counter-revolutionary elements vividly and concretely, to portray the heroic struggle of the People's Liberation Army, the People's Public Security Organs, and the people, and to point out the connection between this struggle and the current work and the future cause of the motherland. Just look at the few anti-espionage films we already have, such as "Invisible Front" and the drama "Enemies Without Guns" (even though this script still has some shortcomings), which have attracted so many audiences, and you will understand the urgent needs of the masses.
    Naturally, our literary and art workers have done some work in this area for more than a year. For example, we already have some of the films, scripts, short plays, poems, and other short works scattered in newspapers and periodicals. However, this work is obviously extremely disproportionate compared with the great historical task of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and compared with the demands of the people.
    The reason why there are few literary and artistic works that express the struggle against the remnants of the counter-revolutionaries is that, in addition to the fact that it has not aroused enough attention in everyone's mind (first of all, the public security organs at all levels do not pay enough attention), writers and literary and artistic workers are not familiar with the struggle life of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. The public security departments, as specialized security organs, have not paid attention to or are not good at cooperating closely with literary and artistic workers, helping them understand the situation, experience life, and familiarize themselves with the necessary professional knowledge and experience. As a result, literary and artistic workers feel that collecting materials from the public security departments and creating works to suppress counter-revolutionaries is not as convenient as going to the countryside, factories, or troops to write about workers, peasants, and soldiers. Although this situation has begun to change recently, the public security organs in many areas have felt the urgent need to cooperate with the literary and artistic circles and create literary and artistic works to suppress counter-revolutionaries, such as Beijing, Tianjin, the Northeast, and Shanxi, where the cooperation with writers and artists is relatively good. But on the whole, it is still far from enough. The shortcomings of the public security organs not actively cooperating with the literary and artistic circles must continue to be overcome. On the part of writers and literary and artistic workers, they should also take the initiative to establish close ties with the public security, judicial organs, and propaganda workers of the People's Liberation Army bandit suppression troops, to understand the situation, collect materials, and familiarize themselves with the struggle life and experience of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. When necessary, they can also consult and revise with them.
    In this way, the problem will be solved well through joint efforts from both sides.
    In which aspects should the literary creation of suppressing counter-revolutionaries mainly start and what should be paid attention to at present? I have the following few immature opinions:
    1. Educate the masses with vivid facts. We must be particularly good at grasping the evidence of the crimes of counter-revolutionary bandits and the trials of counter-revolutionary bandits that are closely related to the immediate interests of the masses, to expose the crimes of secret agents and bandits. Publicize the correct policies of the people's government and show the strength of the people's democratic dictatorship.
    2. Expose the political background of secret agents and bandits. We must pay special attention to fully proving through specific case materials that "all these counter-revolutionary activities are instigated behind the scenes by imperialism, especially American imperialism" (see Chairman Mao's "Strive for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation's Financial and Economic Situation"). Point out the consistency between domestic counter-revolutionary activities and imperialist aggression conspiracies, and that secret agents and bandits are the running dogs of imperialism and their internal accomplices in aggression. Never write domestic counter-revolutionary activities as a purely isolated phenomenon.
    At the same time, it should be pointed out that after the counter-revolutionary elements are severely suppressed by us, they will inevitably tend to be more concealed and intensify their vicious retaliatory activities to arouse higher vigilance among the people.
    3. Publicize Article 7 of the Common Program, "Combining Suppression with Leniency," and the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries" which are concretized based on this guideline. That is, we must publicize that all counter-revolutionary elements who are guilty of heinous crimes and refuse to repent must be suppressed, and we must also publicize the lenient treatment of the people's government for those who are coerced by counter-revolutionaries. In addition, we can also create typical examples in the works for the several types of erroneous thinking among cadres (such as arrogance and underestimation of the enemy, numbness and indifference; confusing the elimination of counter-revolutionary remnants with the consolidation and expansion of the people's democratic united front; fear that suppressing counter-revolutionaries will cause "shock and panic"; and the "benevolent government" viewpoint that we should be kind and lenient after victory, etc.) pointed out in Comrade Peng Zhen's report on the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries," and give them concrete and vivid criticism.
    In addition, the literary and artistic groups of troops, factories, and organs can also create works adapted to the anti-espionage and security work of their departments according to their own positions.
    I hope that soon people will sing songs of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and see more dramas, movies, and literary works about suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

### 一个急待表现的主题——镇压反革命

　　一个急待表现的主题——镇压反革命
    刘恩启
    文艺如何与当前镇压反革命活动这个政治斗争任务相配合，如何表现全国人民与残余反革命分子斗争的主题，表现剿匪与肃清特务的主题，是摆在作家和一切文艺工作者面前的一个严重的迫切的任务。
    我想，现在没有一个人会说，这个主题是不值得表现的。因为，问题越来越明显了：帝国主义的走狗国民党反动派及其帮凶们，决不因为他们的统治被打倒就甘心死亡，而是无时无刻不在利用一切可能，穷凶极恶地向人民反扑。他们企图破坏抗美援朝、土地改革、生产建设等各项工作，各种群众运动。在这种情况下，使人民群众和干部时刻保持对于暗藏敌人的警戒，认清敌人对祖国和人民有什么危害，为什么必须镇压，大家应该怎样来协助政府镇压反革命活动，乃是目前在全国人民中必须进行的政治教育。
    在剿灭土匪肃清特务的战线上，需要表现的东西实在太多了。
    这里我愿意举出一些在剿灭土匪肃清特务斗争中的英雄业迹。当然这些是片断的，不足以说明这一伟大斗争的全部内容。浙江省在解放后，长时期地有着严重的匪患，群众畏匪如虎狼，不敢起来斗争。但当人民政府执行了镇压反革命的政策，处决了一批反革命分子后，地方男女民兵武装大为发展，站岗放哨检查严密，土匪特务行动困难，两个月来从沿海潜入的特务，大都为民兵查获。一个女民兵智擒蒋匪特务纵队司令；一个重要特务分子手持双枪拒捕，为千余民兵重重包围，终遭擒获。杭县民兵围捕一股土匪，一天内民兵即由几十人增至三千人，终于将土匪歼灭。福建长乐群众听说国民党武装特务从海上潜入大陆，讯号响起，数村民兵立即集合搜捕，溃匪大部被民兵捉到。广西一老太婆率领民兵队活捉十多个土匪。江西农民将久捕不获的大土匪头子捉到。湖南省农民在一月份一个月内即协助政府破获特务“地下军”阴谋暴乱案百余起。
    人民解放军每一次剿匪的进军和胜利，人民公安机关每一次对于反革命案件的侦察、破获，都给我们的作家提供了丰富生动的题材。
    人民赞扬、歌颂镇压反革命。他们把能不能“制住反革命”看作是能不能翻身（或翻身能不能巩固）的重要关键。在对反革命的镇压还不够坚决，土匪特务恶霸横行的地方，群众就说：“全国解放了，我们这里天还黑着哩！”“政府不杀反革命，分田我也不敢要！”在坚决镇压反革命之后，人民就扬眉吐气，欢呼拥护，敢于起来斗争了。福建处决了一批反革命分子，农民说：“土地改革分田是第一次翻身，参加农会、讲话有地位是第二次翻身，铲除了小蒋介石是第三次翻身；三翻三中大喜欢。”川东万县枪决恶霸匪首谭伟时，各地人民远道赶来参加，他们说：“我们不看着枪毙他，回去后是不能放心减租退押的！”被害家属指着毛主席像说：“可给我们报仇了！”更有许多地区农民，在镇压反革命分子后，杀鸡鸭上坟祭奠，全村摆酒席，唱太平戏，热烈祝贺。有的还自编快板，自演歌剧，歌唱胜利。如绥远一、二月份镇压一批反革命分子后，集宁一带的老百姓歌颂：“多年冤仇一旦报，多日苦水一日消！”西南处死川、黔边恶霸匪首陈永铃后，农民中流传着几句自编的歌谣：
      三十年来，
      官兵如梳，
      土匪如篦，
      保安团队如刀剃……
      这样的日子永远不再回来了！
    这短短几句，包藏了多少对国民党反动派及其反革命爪牙的憎恨、愤怒，和对今天美好生活的热爱、赞美！
    人民已经为铲除了他们心上的“大石头”、“本地虎”、“地头蛇”（人民这样形容土匪、恶霸、特务）而歌颂，而欢呼了！难道我们的作家、文艺工作者还能沉默吗？
    人民要求坚决镇压反革命，同时人民也要求文学艺术工作者创作赞颂镇压反革命的文艺作品，如同要求赞颂抗美援朝、土地改革、生产建设一样。人民决不满足于仅仅在报纸上公布几条破获或处决反革命案犯的新闻。人民要求形象地、具体地揭穿反革命分子的阴谋罪恶，描绘出人民解放军、人民公安机关和人民群众的英勇斗争，并指出这一斗争与目前各项工作以及与祖国未来事业的关联。只要看一看我们已有的几部反奸影片如《无形战线》和话剧《不拿枪的敌人》（纵然这个剧本还有若干缺点），曾经吸引了那么多的观众，就了解群众的迫切需要了。
    自然我们的文艺工作者一年多以来，在这一方面是做了些工作的。譬如我们已经有了上面所说的一些影片、剧本和散见于各地报刊上的短剧、诗歌和其他短篇创作。但这些工作与镇压反革命活动、巩固人民民主专政的伟大历史任务比较起来，与人民的要求比较起来，显然是极不相称的。
    表现同反革命残余斗争的文艺作品之所以少，除了因为没有普遍引起大家思想上的足够重视（首先是各级公安机关重视不够）外，还因为作家、文艺工作者不熟悉镇压反革命的斗争生活，而作为专门保卫机关的公安部门，又未注意或不善于与文艺工作者密切合作，帮助他们了解情况，体验生活，熟悉必要的业务知识和经验，以致使文艺工作者觉得，到公安部门搜集材料，创作镇压反革命的作品，不如下乡、下厂或下部队写工农兵那么方便些。近来这种情况虽已开始改变，很多地区的公安机关已感到与文艺界合作、创作镇压反革命文艺的迫切需要，如北京、天津、东北、山西等地，与作家、艺人的合作就比较好。但整个说来还是很不够的。公安机关不积极与文艺界合作的缺点必须继续克服。在作家和文艺工作者方面，也应该主动地与人民公安、司法机关，人民解放军剿匪部队的宣传工作者取得密切的联系，了解情况。搜集材料，熟悉镇压反革命的斗争生活和经验，必要时，并可与他们一起磋商，修改。
    这样，从两方面来共同努力，问题就好解决了。
    镇压反革命的文艺创作，在目前主要应从那几个方面着手和应注意些什么？我有以下几点极不成熟的意见：
    一、以活生生的事实教育群众。要特别善于抓住当时当地与群众切身利害密切相关的反革命匪徒的罪证，和对于反革命匪徒的审判，来揭露特务土匪的罪行。宣扬人民政府的正确政策、显示人民民主专政力量的强大。
    二、揭穿特务土匪的政治背景。要特别注意透过具体案犯材料，充分证明“所有这些反革命活动，都有帝国主义特别是美帝国主义在背后策动”（见毛主席《为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争》）。指明国内反革命活动与帝国主义侵略阴谋的一致性，特务土匪是帝国主义的走狗和它侵略的内应。绝不要把国内反革命活动写成单纯孤立的现象。
    同时应指出反革命分子遭我严厉镇压后必然更加趋向隐蔽，更加紧其狠毒的报复性活动，来引起人民更高的警惕。
    三、宣传共同纲领第七条“镇压与宽大相结合”的方针，与根据这一方针具体化了的“惩治反革命条例”。即要宣传对一切罪大恶极、怙恶不悛的反革命分子必须镇压，又要宣传人民政府对为反革命胁迫的分子的宽大处理。此外并可将彭真同志关于“惩治反革命条例”报告中所指出的干部中几种错误思想类型（如骄傲轻敌，麻木不仁；把肃清反革命残余与人民民主统一战线的巩固扩大相混淆；怕镇压反革命会引起“震动与恐慌”；以及胜利了应仁慈宽大的“仁政”观点等）及其害处，在作品中创作典型，予以具体的、形象的批判。
    此外，部队、工厂、机关的文艺团体，亦可各就自己的岗位，创作与本部门除奸保卫工作相适应的作品。
    希望不久以后，人们就唱起镇压反革命的歌子，看到更多的镇压反革命的戏剧、电影和文学作品。
