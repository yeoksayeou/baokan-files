I accuse Gu Ren'en of the following crimes in Hangzhou:

(1) When Gu Ren'en began "preaching" in Hangzhou, he targeted young students and spread counter-revolutionary ideas on a large scale. In the beginning, he said that he had "thoroughly studied the theories of Marxism-Leninism before liberation," but the result of his study was that it was "meaningless." He also said that he "participated in the revolution very early and was in the same period as Chairman Mao." And because he "went to prison for the revolution," he later "preached" because he believed that "revolution is a matter of one general succeeding at the cost of ten thousand bones." This nonsense was precisely carrying out the conspiracy of American imperialism for him to "use the opportunity of preaching to conduct anti-communist propaganda."

(2) Engaging in deception under the guise of treating illnesses. He said he had olive oil passed on to him by Dr. Song Xiangjie. One pastor said that this oil was bought in Hangzhou. The scam he used at Gulou Church in Hangzhou to make a mute speak has now also been exposed. Pastor Yang of the China Jesus Preaching Church said: "The mute's mother is a member of our church, and the mute is a semi-mute, who can hear and speak simple words to people. After Gu Ren'en prayed for him, he followed Gu Ren'en in front of the microphone on the platform and said, 'Hallelujah, praise the Lord.' In fact, the mute had been able to say these few words for a long time."

(3) Gu Ren'en is also a big liar and a big swindler. He once personally told a pastor that he was a "CPPCC representative," but everyone knows that there are absolutely no religious democratic人士 in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. But he shamelessly said that he must be there. This pastor searched through the list of all CPPCC representatives but still couldn't find him. When asked again, he said: "I am an observer." In addition, he also said that the Soviet church had invited him to preach in the Soviet Union, attempting to use lies to raise his own status. When swindling money, he had quarrels with Pastor Geng of Gulou Church and other pastors of Gospel Church over donations.

(4) Gu Ren'en's debauchery with women is the same everywhere. When he arrived at the Hangzhou YMCA in May 1950, a nurse from Guangji Hospital who had lost her husband and had three or four children was the first to be deceived by him, forcing him to leave Hangzhou. There was also a pastor who was very close to him, whom he always called his elder brother, and he even attempted to defile his elder brother's wife. How can such a preacher have the great power of God?

Speaking of this, I cannot but examine ourselves. Because our own studies were insufficient and our political awareness was not high when we were first liberated, we were not responsible enough to the people and our patriotism was not sincere. When I learned of his reactionary remarks, I only told my colleagues not to let Gu Ren'en preach in places related to us, and to ask our colleagues not to listen to his preaching. However, we did not further raise necessary vigilance about his activities, investigate and study them, and expose them. As a result, he became more courageous in carrying out counter-revolutionary propaganda and deceiving believers. In addition, I would also like to criticize some of our Hangzhou colleagues, that Gu Ren'en's corrupt life made him unworthy of being a preacher, but they were influenced by the idea of concealing evil and promoting good, and dared not openly expose him, which made him reckless in carrying out counter-revolutionary activities, defiling women, and causing physical, mental, and financial losses to hundreds of people seeking medical treatment, and even causing death. In this way, objectively, we have shielded a heinous enemy who is engaged in espionage activities under the guise of religion.

　　顾犯仁恩在杭州的罪行
    杭州基督教协进会副会长　钮志芳
    我控诉顾仁恩在杭州的罪行有以下的几种。
    （一）顾仁恩在杭州开始“传道”时就以青年学生为对象，大肆散布反革命思想。开始的时候，就说他“对马列主义的理论，早在解放前已有彻底的研究”，但研究的结果是“毫无意思”。他又说“很早就参加过革命，是和毛主席在一个时期的”。并且因为“革命入狱”，后来由于他认为“革命是一将成名万骨枯的事情”，所以他就“传了道”。这一派胡说，正是执行了美帝国主义要他“借传教的机会作反对共产党的宣传”的阴谋。
    （二）假借医病进行欺骗。他说他有宋向节博士传给他的橄榄油。有一位牧师说，这油就是在杭州买的。他在杭州鼓楼堂使哑吧说话的骗局现在也拆穿了。中国耶稣传教会的杨牧师说：“那哑吧的母亲就是我们礼拜堂的教友，那哑吧是个半哑，他能听也能跟人讲简单的话。顾仁恩给他祷告后，他在讲台就跟着顾仁恩在播音器前说“哈利路亚，感谢主。”其实这几句话，那哑吧很早就会说的。”
    （三）顾仁恩还是一个大扯谎家，大骗子，他曾亲自对一位牧师说，他是“政协代表”，可是大家都知道中国人民政治协商会议中的宗教界民主人士中绝对没有他。他却无耻地说，一定有他。这位牧师翻遍了全体政协代表名单，仍然找不到他。再问，他说：“我是列席”。此外，他还这样说，苏联的教会曾请他到苏联去布道，企图用谎言来抬高他的身价。他在骗钱时，为了捐款曾和鼓楼堂的耿牧师及福音堂的其他牧师们都有争吵。
    （四）顾仁恩的污辱妇女到处都是一样的。他在一九五○年五月到了杭州兴奋会，有一位死了丈夫、有三四个孩子的广济医院的护士，就首先受了他的欺骗，使他不能不离开杭州。还有一位同他极好的牧师，他一向称为大哥的，而他竟企图污辱他的大嫂。这样的传教人，他怎能有上帝的大能？
    讲到这里我就不能不检讨我们自己。由于刚解放时，自己的学习不够，政治的认识不高，因之对人民负责不够和爱国心不切。当我知道他的反动言论后，仅仅是告诉我的同工，不让顾仁恩和我们有关的地方讲道，要我们同工也不要去听他讲道。但是没有进一步对他的活动引起必要的警惕，予以调查研究及揭发。因此也使他作反革命宣传及欺骗教徒的胆量更大。此外，我也对我们杭州的一部分同道提出批评，对顾仁恩生活腐化，是不配做传道圣工的人，但是他们受了隐恶扬善不敢开罪人的影响，不去公开地揭发，使他胆大妄为，进行反革命活动，污辱妇女，并造成了为求医治病的几百个人民的身体、精神、金钱上的损失，甚至因而死亡。这样，客观上是包庇了披着宗教外衣进行特务活动十恶不赦的敌人。
