　　Liaoyang Telephone Bureau
　  Should Accept Criticism and Improve Work

Editor Comrade:
    We believe that the work of the Liaoyang City Telephone Bureau in Liaodong Province needs improvement. They often make mistakes in their work and are not willing to humbly accept criticism from the masses. In just one week, from March 19th to 26th, our unit encountered four errors in using the telephone. For example, on March 19th at 15:30, we requested a long-distance call to Haicheng. After we finished speaking, the telephone bureau failed to disconnect the line, and the time before disconnection was included in the calculation of the call fee. On March 20th at 6:40, when we were connecting to Shenyang, they made the same mistake. It was only after the Shenyang Telephone Bureau provided proof that the error was corrected. In addition, on March 19th and 20th, they twice connected the wrong telephone numbers.
    To avoid affecting our work, we sent people to the telephone bureau three times to request improvements to the above situations. Initially, the lower-level cadres did not care and told us to find the bureau director. However, when we found the bureau director, not only was the specific problem not resolved, but he also said that we should not casually come to the state communications agency. We hope that the Liaoyang City Telephone Bureau will improve its work and make a public self-criticism in the Party newspaper.

　　辽阳市电话局
　  应接受批评改进工作编辑同志：
    我们认为辽东省辽阳市电话局的工作需要改进。他们在工作中经常出差错，而且不能虚心接受群众的批评。仅我们一个单位在三月十九至二十六日一周内使用电话中，电话局即出了四次差错。如三月十九日十五时三十分，我们向海城要长途电话，说完话，电话局却不给撤线，在计算通话费时，把不给撤线的时间也计算在内；三月二十日六时四十分，我们和沈阳接话时，他们又犯了同样的错误，最后由沈阳电话局证明才改正过来。另外在三月十九、二十两天，他们曾两次把电话号码挂错。
    我们为避免工作受影响，曾三次派人去电话局要求改进上述情况。开始下级干部不管，叫去找该局局长。但是，我们找到该局局长后，不但具体问题未解决，他反说我们不该随便到国家通信机关里来。我们希望辽阳市电话局改进自己的工作，并在党报上进行公开检讨。
