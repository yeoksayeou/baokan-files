Publication News

	Checking Anti-American Propaganda
	*Northeast Daily*, *Liberation Daily*, *Tianjin Daily*, and others have recently published materials checking the popularization and depth of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, proving that even in cities with relatively good work, the degree of popularization is still far from enough. The *Northeast Daily* published two articles on April 15th, "A Sampling of a Residential Group in Liaoyang City" and "A Sampling of a Residential Group in Heping District, Shenyang," proving that although Shenyang and Liaoyang are both large and medium-sized cities in the Northeast, the past work of resisting America and aiding Korea has generally been done well, but there are still many "dead corners" in the propaganda. The *Liberation Daily* published an investigation on April 11th regarding the propaganda of resisting America and aiding Korea among residents of Meifang Lane in Putuo District, Shanghai, proving that although Meifang Lane is one of the better neighborhoods in Shanghai in terms of propaganda and education for resisting America and aiding Korea, and has made great achievements in its work, about half of the residents have still not received patriotic education. The two newspapers published short commentaries on this, pointing out that "a thorough inspection should be carried out to eliminate the 'blank spots' of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement." "Any complacent mood of 'almost done' is unrealistic and harmful."
	*Study* Magazine Publishes Engels' "On Authority"
	The first issue of the fourth volume of *Study* magazine published Engels' "On Authority," written in 1873 and translated by Guo Dali, and Fan Ruoyu's "Notes on Reading 'On Authority'." Engels' article was a product of the struggle against anarchists. He particularly used the organizational situation of modern industry to illustrate that a certain authority and a certain obedience are necessary in any society, without which there can be no social organization. He sharply criticized the anarchist concept of the state, writing: "Have these gentlemen ever seen a revolution? Revolution is undoubtedly the most authoritative thing in the world; it is an act in which one part of the population forces its will on the other part by means of rifles, bayonets, and cannons, and thus by all conceivable authoritative means; and the victorious party, if it does not want its struggle to have been in vain, must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its weapons inspire in the reactionaries. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeoisie? Conversely, should we not rather censure it for not having made more extensive use of this authority?"
	The dictatorship of the revolutionaries over the counter-revolutionaries is proved necessary by all historical experience. Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin have all written specifically on this, and Chairman Mao has also given many instructions on this. Mr. Lu Xun, in many of his essays, repeatedly stated this point in clear and pungent terms. There are also many literary works with this as their theme, such as Lunacharsky's *The Liberated Don Quixote* (translated by Qu Qiubai). We believe that it is necessary to organize, edit, and introduce these materials, and we hope that someone will do this work.
	Establishment of the Fuel Industry Publishing House
	The specialization of publishing work is gradually progressing. The Fuel Industry Publishing House, with an industrial department as its scope, has recently been established and has begun publishing books. In order to better serve economic construction and strengthen the political quality of publications, it is of great significance to establish such a specialized industrial publishing house. The five books published by the publishing house are: 1. *Guidelines and Policies of the Fuel Industry*, which compiles certain policy guidance documents written by Minister of Fuel Chen Yu and Deputy Minister Li Fan, and the resolutions (abstracts) of the three conferences on coal mines, electricity, and petroleum in 1950; 2. *Major Improvements in the Electric Power Industry*; 3. *Major Improvements in the Coal Mining Industry*, which compiles the achievements and summary of experience of the national and local electric power and coal mine work in 1950; 4. *Mechanization of Artificial Roof Caving in Coal Mining Fields* by A. Denisov; 5. *Advanced Production Experience of Soviet Miners* by Kutcher.
	*Mechanization of Artificial Roof Caving in Coal Mining Fields* was written by Soviet experts in the department, which is a great revolution in China's coal mine production. In the past, Chinese coal mines used manual roof caving, and each worker could only produce 0.3-0.45 tons of coal every eight hours. Now, some coal mines use mechanical roof caving, with six people per shift, producing more than 200 to 250 tons of coal in seven hours, reaching the Soviet Union's second Stakhanov record (the current Soviet record has reached more than 2,000 tons).
	Periodicals Gradually Expand Book Review Work
	Conducting book reviews that are generally in line with the professional nature of each periodical, based on the requirements of a specific readership, is one of the important and regular tasks of each periodical. Since the General Administration of News and the General Administration of Publication issued instructions on the establishment of book review work in national newspapers and periodicals, some periodicals have added book review columns since April (such as *Study* and *People Magazine*), and some periodicals have strengthened this work. From the eleventh issue of the seventh volume, *Prospects* has continuously reflected readers' opinions and carried out the struggle against harmful reading materials. The ninth and eleventh issues of *Tianjin Education* successively criticized several geography textbooks, and in conjunction with teaching, recommended a good book, *First Grade Students* (Xinhua Bookstore Edition). The newly released *Central Cooperative Newsletter* introduced the novel *Gao Gan Da* (Chinese People's Literature and Art Series), which describes the development of the Renjiagou Cooperative in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in 1941, arousing the spirit of service of every cooperative cadre to learn from Gao Gan Da. *Popular Science Work* published the highly instructive *Review of <Modern Science Series>* (Cultural Life Publishing House Edition). The April issue of *Translation Bulletin* published three book reviews: a review of the Sanlian Bookstore edition, Guo Jingtian's *Russian-Chinese Dictionary*, a review of the Wenguang Bookstore edition, Gao Qingyue et al.'s translation of *The Storm*, and a review of the Xinchao Bookstore edition, Lai Jing's translation of *Earth and Mankind*. The April issue of *Science Popularization* (published by Commercial Press from this issue) reviewed two popular astronomy books in the "Popular Astronomy" column: Sanlian Bookstore's *Our Universe* and Xinhua Bookstore Central and Southern Branch's *Popular Natural Science Talks*. At the end of this criticism, the Popular Astronomy Society put forward a very good suggestion: "For popular science books, they must be accurate and error-free." "We are willing to cooperate with writers and publishers to point out errors in the original manuscripts and provide new information, including pictures, to further improve the editing of popular astronomy books and periodicals." It is very important today to meticulously criticize scientific books and to have close cooperation between scientific organizations, publishers, and authors.
	Two Linguistic Works
	The People's Publishing House published two linguistic works in March: 1. *Vocabulary of Monosyllabic Words in Beijing Dialect* edited by Lu Zhiwei (25 open, 171 pages, priced at 15,800 yuan); 2. *Grammatical Studies of Indonesian* by Sha Ping (25 open, 344 pages, priced at 28,000 yuan).
	Fifteen or sixteen years ago, Mr. Lu Zhiwei began collecting monosyllabic words in Beijing dialect, "treating Beijing dialect as an ordinary dialect" for Chinese language research, and has collected thousands of words, "only today under the banner of the people, have I found an opportunity to publish."
	Mr. Sha Ping's *Grammatical Studies of Indonesian* is the result of the author's study of the Indonesian language while in exile in Sumatra during World War II. The author pointed out, "The history of the emergence of Indonesian is very short, and it is still a language that is growing and developing. The study of Indonesian grammar is even a pioneering work, even a kind of adventurous pioneering work." The author hopes that this book can provide some useful reference materials for researchers of grammar and writing reform issues.
	About *1951 Astronomical Almanac*
	China's applicable *1951 Astronomical Almanac* was published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in January of this year. Chen Zun Gui, who is responsible for editing the book, recently published an article "Starting from the 1951 Astronomical Almanac" in the second volume of the fourth issue of *Science Bulletin*, which briefly discusses the importance of such almanacs and the process of editing astronomical almanacs in China over the years.
	Astronomical almanacs not only help in the observation of celestial phenomena, but they are also indispensable tools in aviation, navigation, surveying, water conservancy and various construction undertakings, and are more closely related to navigation. The compilation of such almanacs has a history of more than 30 years in China, but in the past under the reactionary regime, this "unpopular academic field" was extremely despised. Although it was nominally a publication of a national academic institution, in the more than 30 years before liberation, it was only published ten times in total, and in many other years, it was suspended due to lack of reference materials or editing and printing funds. In this article, the author proposes an improvement plan for editing astronomical almanacs in the future, planning to "continue to publish forever in the future and develop this cause."
	*Lu Xun's Diary* Facsimile Edition to Be Published Soon
	Shanghai Publishing Company is now carrying out the facsimile printing of Lu Xun's Diary. Mr. Lu Xun's diary, written from May 1912 to October 16, 1936, has one volume each year, a total of twenty-five volumes, but the eleventh volume (i.e., 1922) was lost when the Japanese invaders searched Mr. Xu Guangping's residence in Shanghai in December 1941 and arrested her, so only twenty-four volumes are now being reproduced. The purpose of reprinting this diary is to preserve documents and for research needs. Therefore, a total of only one thousand and fifty copies are reproduced, specifically for domestic libraries, cultural institutions, and researchers to purchase. Mass distribution will have to wait for the future typesetting edition. The first volume of the diary will be published on May 5th.
	*Sino-Soviet Friendship* Bi-Monthly, Volume 3, Issue 7 Published
	*Sino-Soviet Friendship* bi-monthly, Volume 3, Issue 7 was published on April 20th. This issue of the journal published editorials with the themes of "Celebrating Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling's Award of the 'Strengthening International Peace' Stalin International Prize" and "The Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in Various Regions Should Actively Participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Conjunction with Sino-Soviet Friendship Work." It also re-published four works by Soong Ching Ling, as well as the resumes of seven winners.
	Important articles in this issue include: Zhang Xingshi's "From May Day to the Soviet Working Class," Qi Wangshu's "American Imperialism Has Consistently Implemented Anti-Soviet Policies," Chen Ying's "'Truth' Newspaper Interview," Wang Fan's "How to Use Charts and Materials in Mass Political Agitation Work in Soviet Factories and Collective Farms," and others.

　　出版动态
  检查抗美援朝宣传
    东北日报、解放日报、天津日报等最近都发表了一些抗美援朝运动普及和深入程度检查的材料，证明即使是工作较好的城市中，普及的程度也还是很不够的。东北日报四月十五日发表了《辽阳市一个住民组的抽查》和《沈阳和平区一个住民组的抽查》两文，证明尽管沈阳、辽阳都是东北的大、中城市，过去的抗美援朝工作一般的都还做的不错，但仍存在着宣传中的许多“死角”。解放日报四月十一日发表了关于上海市普陀区梅芳里居民中抗美援朝宣传的调查，证明梅芳里虽然是上海市抗美援朝宣传教育做得较好的里弄之一，工作上有很大成绩，但住民中未受到爱国主义教育的仍约有半数。两报为此发表短评，指出应该“深入进行检查，扫除抗美援朝运动的‘空白点’”。“任何‘差不多了’的自满情绪，都是不合实际、有害无益的。”
  《学习》杂志发表恩格斯的《论权威》
    四卷一期《学习》杂志发表了郭大力译、恩格斯在一八七三年写的《论权威》一文，和范若愚的“读‘论权威’札记”。恩格斯这篇文章，是和无政府主义者斗争的产物。他特别用现代工业的组织情形来说明一定的权威和一定的服从，在任何社会都是必需的，没有它，就不可能有任何社会组织。他尖锐地抨击了无政府主义的国家观念，他写道：“这些先生们没有见过革命么？革命就确确实实是世间最有权威的东西；它是这样一种行动，在这种行动中，人口的一部分，用快枪、刺刀，和大炮，从而用一切想得出来的最权威的手段，把他们的意志，强加于别一部分人；胜利的党如果不要使斗争变为毫无结果，他们就得用恐怖，用他们的武器在反动者间造成的恐怖，来维持这种统治。如果巴黎公社不利用武装人民的这种权威，来反对资产阶级，它会支持得了一天么？反过来，它的过错不正好在于它没有充分广泛地利用这种权威么？”
    革命者对反革命的专政，是一切历史经验都证明为必要的。马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林，都曾对此有过专门著述，毛主席对此也有过许多指示。鲁迅先生在他的许多杂文中，曾用明确、辛辣的笔调，再三地申述过这点。文艺著作中也有不少以此为主题的，如卢那察尔斯基的《解放了的董·吉诃德》（有瞿秋白译本）。我们以为，把这些材料加以整理、编辑、介绍都是必要的，希望有人来做这一工作。
  燃料工业出版社成立
    出版工作的专业化在逐步进展中。以一个工业部门为范围的出版社——燃料工业出版社，已于最近创建成立，并开始出书。为了使出版工作更好地服务经济建设，加强出版物的政治质量，建立这种专门的工业出版社极有意义。该社已出的五本书是：一，《燃料工业的方针与政策》，编集了燃料部陈郁部长、李范一副部长写的某些政策指导文件和一九五○年煤矿、电业、石油三个会议的决议（摘要）；二，《电力工业的重大改进》，三，《煤矿工业的重大改进》，编集了一九五○年全国及各地电业、煤矿工作的成就和总结经验；四，阿·捷尼索夫著《采煤场子人工放顶的机械化》；五，库切尔著《苏联矿工的先进生产经验》。
    《采煤场子人工放顶的机械化》，是该部苏联专家写的，这是中国煤矿生产的大革命。中国过去煤矿用人工放顶，每一工人每八小时只能产煤○·三——○·四五吨。现在若干煤矿使用机械放顶，每六人一班，七小时产煤二百至二百五十吨以上，达到苏联第二次的斯达汉诺夫的纪录（现在苏联纪录已达二千多吨）。
  期刊逐渐展开了书评工作
    针对一定读者对象的要求，进行与每一期刊专业性质大体相符的图书评论工作，是每一期刊的重要而经常的任务之一。自从新闻总署和出版总署发布了关于全国报纸期刊均应建立书报评论工作的指示后，有的期刊自四月份即增设了书报评介栏（如《学习》、《人物杂志》），有的期刊加强了这一工作。《展望》自第七卷第十一期起连续反映了读者意见，进行对有害读物的斗争。《天津教育》九、十一两期连续批评了几本地理教科书，并结合教学，推荐了一本好书——《一年级学生》（新华书店版）。新出的《中央合作通讯》介绍了以描写一九四一年间陕甘宁边区任家沟合作社发展情况为内容的长篇小说《高干大》（中国人民文艺丛书），唤起每一个合作社干部学习高干大的服务精神。《科学普及工作》发表了具有很强指导性的《评〈现代科学小丛书〉》（文化生活出版社版）。翻译通报四月号发表了三篇书评：评三联书店版、郭景天编《俄华辞典》，评文光书店版、高清岳等译《暴风雨》，评新潮书店版、来井译《地球与人类》。《科学大众》四月号（该刊自该期起由商务印书馆出版）《大众天文》栏评介了两本通俗天文书籍：三联书店版《我们的宇宙》和新华书店中南总分店版《通俗自然科学讲话》。在这篇批评文字的结尾，大众天文社提出一个很好的意见：“为了普及的通俗科学书籍，必须正确无误。”“我们愿意和作家和出版者来共同合作努力，提出原稿的错误，供给新的资料，包括图片在内，更进一步搞好通俗天文书刊的编辑工作。”对科学书籍精细提出批评，科学团体和出版者、著作者的密切合作，在今天都是很重要的。
  两本语言学的著作
    人民出版社在三月份出版了两本语言学的著作：一、陆志韦编著《北京话单音词词汇》（二十五开，一七一页，定价一五八○○元）；二、沙平著《印度尼西亚语语法研究》（二十五开，三四四页，定价二八○○○元）。
    在距今十五六年前，陆志韦先生开始收集北京话的单音词，“把北京话当做一种平常的土话”进行汉语研究，已经收集了几千个词汇，“直到今天在人民的旗帜之下，才找到一个出版的机会”。
    沙平先生的《印度尼西亚语语法研究》一书，是作者在第二次世界大战期间流亡苏门答腊时学习印度尼西亚语言的成果。作者指出，“印度尼西亚语的产生的历史很短，它还是正在成长和发育中的语言。印尼语法的研究更是一种草创工作，甚至是一种带冒险性的拓荒工作。”作者希望他这一本书对于语法学和文字改革问题的研究者可以提供一些有用的参考资料。
  关于《一九五一年天文年历》
    我国适用的《一九五一年天文年历》已于本年一月由中国科学院出版。本书负责编辑者陈遵妫最近在科学通报二卷四期上发表《从一九五一年天文年历谈起》一文，对于这类年历的重要，和我国历年编辑天文年历的经过，略有论述。
    天文年历不仅有助于天象的观测，它在航空、航海、测量、水利各种建设事业上都是不可或缺的工具，对于航海方面关系更为密切。这类年历的编制在中国已有三十多年的历史，但过去在反动政权之下，这种“冷门学术”是极端被轻视的，它在名义上虽是国立学术机关的刊物，而在解放前的三十多年中，一共只出版过十次，其他的许多年份都是由于缺乏参考材料或编印经费而停编停刊的。作者在本文中拟了一个今后编辑天文年历的改进方针，计划在今后“永远地继续出版，把这个事业发展下去”。
  《鲁迅日记》影印本即将出版
    上海出版公司现在正在进行鲁迅日记的影印工作。鲁迅先生自一九一二年五月起至一九三六年十月十六日止所写的日记，每年一本，共有二十五本，但第十一本（即一九二二年的），在一九四一年十二月日寇搜查许广平先生在上海寓处，并把她逮捕入狱时失落，所以现在影印的只有二十四本。影印这部日记的目的是保存文献和供研究上的需要。因此，一共只影印了一千零五十部，专供国内各图书馆、文化机关、研究者购置。大量发行，有待于将来的铅印本。日记第一函将于五月五日出版。
  《中苏友好》半月刊三卷七期出版
    《中苏友好》半月刊三卷七期已于四月二十日出版。该刊本期以“庆贺宋副会长庆龄荣获‘加强国际和平’斯大林国际奖金”和“各地中苏友协都要结合中苏友好工作积极参加抗美援朝运动”为题，发表社论。并重新发表了宋庆龄的四篇著作，以及七位获奖者的简历。
    该刊本期的重要文章尚有：张醒石的《从五一节谈到苏联工人阶级》、齐望曙的《美帝国主义一贯实行反苏政策》、陈颖的《‘真理’报访问记》、王繁的《苏联工厂和集体农庄的群众政治鼓动工作中怎样使用图表材料》等。
