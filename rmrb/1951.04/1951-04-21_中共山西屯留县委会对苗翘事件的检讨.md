　　中共山西屯留县委会对苗翘事件的检讨
To the Editor:
    The opinions expressed by readers from various locations regarding the Tunliu Miao Qiao incident (see page three of this newspaper, April 12th) are excellent and are of great help to us in further understanding the significance of the Miao Qiao incident. We have convened three county committee meetings to conduct self-criticism on this issue. We are now writing out the results of our self-examination and earnestly hope that readers from various locations will continue to offer us criticisms to educate ourselves and the entire party.
    Tunliu County is an old revolutionary base area. The reason why the reactionary landlord Cui Chengzhuang dared to act so violently as to murder peasants is inseparable from the laxity and complacency that arose in our minds after the land reform and the end of the war. This thinking is mainly manifested in the following aspects: First, the county leadership suffered from serious complacency, and therefore could not see the existence and activities of counter-revolutionary elements. In the past, more than twenty incidents of unlawful landlords counterattacking peasants occurred, and many reactionary rumors were discovered, but we turned a blind eye to them and failed to severely suppress the reactionary elements. In this way, we objectively fueled the arrogance of unlawful landlords in counterattacking the peasants. Second, in the past, in the implementation of the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, there were deviations of "unbounded leniency" and untimely suppression. Of the more than twenty landlord counterattack incidents, only five were handled by the government, and the handling was extremely unserious. For example, Shen Panghai, an unlawful landlord in Chengguan, poisoned two pigs belonging to the emancipated peasant Wang Yuanlin and forcibly seized a piece of land in front of Wang Yuanlin's house. After Wang Yuanlin reported the matter, the government only sentenced Shen Panghai to three months in prison. Shen Panghai went back and sarcastically said to Wang Yuanlin's wife: "The government is not your father. You sued me for nothing, and you didn't even get a pig bristle." The Miao Qiao incident was dragged on for more than one hundred days from its occurrence to the arrest. The county committee's earnest supervision and inspection were insufficient during this period. Third, in the past, the county committee's leadership over the people's armed forces, public security, and judicial work was insufficient. Before the rectification campaign, the public security and armed forces departments were not soundly organized, but the county committee did not pay attention to rectification and strengthening in time. Therefore, these departments were unable to play their due role in suppressing counter-revolutionaries for a long time. Fourth, the county committee's education of party and non-party cadres and the masses in the past was very poor, causing the broad masses of cadres and the masses to lose the political vigilance they should have had. Some people said: "The landlords have changed their class status after the land reform. In the old revolutionary base areas, how dare the landlords counterattack? The united front means uniting with the landlords!" This gave the unlawful landlords an opportunity to counterattack.
    We must profoundly learn from the bloody lessons of the Miao Qiao incident, thoroughly defeat the unlawful landlords' counterattack, and suppress counter-revolutionary activities. We must carry out the following tasks: First, the entire county must universally hold a memorial service for the Li Fuchang family, organize peasants to accuse the unlawful landlords of their counterattacking behavior and the crimes of American imperialism, mobilize the masses to suppress various counter-revolutionary activities, ban secret societies, strengthen patriotic ideological education, and deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea. Second, cadres of county and district agencies should devote one week of study time (two hours per day) to studying "What Lessons Did the Jishan Incident Teach Us?" (Shanxi Daily editorial), "Why Must We Resolutely Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries?" (People's Daily editorial), "Severely Punish the Unlawful Landlords' Counterattack" (Shanxi Daily editorial), and the Central People's Government Government Administration Council's decision on safeguarding state secrets and other documents, liquidate the complacency in the cadres' minds, and improve political vigilance. (Editor's note: At the same time, the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries and Comrade Peng Zhen's report on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the issue of the regulations on the punishment of counter-revolutionaries should be studied.) Third, strengthen the leadership of public security, judicial, and people's armed forces work, and appropriately adjust cadres and strictly rectify the public security forces. Fourth, on the basis of ideological education, strictly examine and deal with party member cadres who violated the law, neglected their duties, and lost their revolutionary stance in the Miao Qiao incident, so as to educate the wrongdoers themselves and the entire party.

### 中共山西屯留县委会对苗翘事件的检讨

　　中共山西屯留县委会对苗翘事件的检讨编辑同志：
    各地读者对屯留苗翘事件（见本报四月十二日三版）所提出的意见都是很好的，这对我们进一步认识苗翘事件的意义，有极大的帮助。我们对于这一问题曾召开三次县委会议，进行检讨。兹将我们的检查结果写出来，热望各地读者继续对我们提出批评意见，以教育我们自己和全党。
    屯留县是老区。反动地主崔成庄所以敢于逞凶杀害农民，是与我们在土地改革及战争结束后产生的轻敌麻痹思想分不开的。这种思想主要表现在以下几方面：首先是我们县领导上存在着严重的麻痹思想，因此看不见反革命分子的存在与活动。过去已发生二十余起不法地主向农民反攻的破坏活动，并发现很多反动谣言，但我们对此熟视无睹，未给反动分子以严厉的镇压。这样，在客观上助长了不法地主向农民反攻的气焰。第二、过去在执行镇压反革命政策中，存在着“宽大无边”和镇压不及时的偏向。二十余起地主反攻事件中，经政府处理的仅五件，并且处理得极不严肃。例如城关不法地主申胖孩毒死了翻身农民王元林的两口猪，并强夺了王元林门前地基一块。经王元林告发后，政府只判了申胖孩三个月徒刑了事。申胖孩回去便讽刺王元林的妻子说：“政府不是你爹，你白告我一状，连根猪毛也没赔给你。”苗翘事件从发生到捕案，拖拉了一百多天，这中间县委认真的督促检查是很不够的。第三、过去县委对人民武装、公安、司法等工作的领导不够。整风以前，公安、武装部门机构很不健全，但县委并未及时注意整顿和加强。因此，这些部门便长时间不能在镇压反革命中发挥其应有的作用。第四、县委过去对党内外干部及群众的教育很差，使广大干部及群众失去应有的政治警觉性。有人说：“地主在土地改革后都变了成份。在老区地主还敢反攻？统一战线就是和地主讲团结！”这就给了不法地主以反攻的可乘之机。
    我们应该深刻接受苗翘事件血的教训，彻底击退不法地主反攻，镇压反革命活动。我们要进行下列各项工作：一、全县要普遍对李福昌全家举行追悼，组织农民控诉不法地主的反攻行为和美帝国主义的罪行，发动群众镇压各种反革命活动，取缔会道门，加强爱国主义的思想教育，深入抗美援朝运动。二、县区各机关干部专门抽出一星期的学习时间（每天两小时）学习“稷山事件给了我们什么教训”（山西日报社论）、“为什么必须坚决镇压反革命”（人民日报社论）、“严厉制裁不法地主的反攻”（山西日报社论），以及中央人民政府政务院关于保守国家机密的决定等文件，清算干部中的麻痹思想，提高政治警觉性。（编者按：应当同时学习中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例及彭真同志关于镇压反革命和惩治反革命条例问题的报告。）三、加强对公安、司法、人民武装工作的领导，并适当地调整干部，严格地整顿公安部队。四、在思想教育的基础上，对苗翘事件中违法失职和丧失革命立场的党员干部进行严格检查和处理，以便教育犯错误者本人和全党。  中共山西屯留县委会
