　　Heroic Chinese Civilian Laborers Volunteering to Aid Korea
　　By Our Correspondent　Tian Liu
　　Everywhere in Korea, there are Chinese civilian labor teams volunteering to aid Korea, fighting selflessly and heroically for the victory at the front lines.
　　On the front lines, civilian stretcher teams rescue the wounded, quickly loading them onto cars or trains to be transported to the rear for treatment; at train stations or parking lots, near warehouses, countless civilian laborers are busily loading, unloading, and transporting supplies; along railways and highways, civilian laborers are constantly carrying out emergency repairs to ensure that the rear transportation lines of the People's Army are unimpeded. Their slogan is: "Establish indestructible and unbombable strong transportation lines."
　　The civilian laborers mostly come from rural areas of Northeast China, some from the great grasslands of Northern Manchuria, having traveled thousands of miles to reach the Yalu River, and now, following the heroic People's Army, they have come to central Korea, more than eight hundred miles from the border of their homeland.
　　Near a train station on the way to Seoul, a large bridge was destroyed by enemy aircraft, and trains could not pass – but transportation cannot stop for a moment! A team of Chinese volunteer civilian laborers took on the urgent and arduous task of repairing the bridge and moving supplies. They transported the supplies brought by train from this side of the river to the other, loading them onto trains and cars coming from the opposite side, and then transporting them to the front. Trains brought tens of thousands of tons of supplies, all of which had to be transported across the river that night, or there would be a risk of losses when enemy aircraft came at dawn. The river was very wide, and the round trip from this side to the parking lot on the other side was six or seven *li*. Each civilian laborer had to transport one or even two tons of supplies across the river each night; each person had to run back and forth a dozen or twenty times to complete the task. Just the distance was more than a hundred *li* each night, not to mention the heavy supplies on their shoulders! But the slogan of the civilian laborers was: "Unload as much as comes, guarantee transportation across the river that night." A box of soy-braised pork weighed forty *jin*, and everyone carried two boxes to run, some even carried three boxes. A civilian laborer from Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, even carried four boxes. Everyone knew the meaning of their work; the glorious call of "Guarantee victory at the front, for the victory at the front" inspired them. Xing Zhanyuan, a middle-aged farmer from Wuchang County, told me with full confidence in victory: "Our volunteers, needless to say, even the enemy admits are an invincible army in the world; our rear, the workers have increased production by one time, and the farmers have also increased grain production by more than 40% compared to last year. The front needs what, the rear gives what; gives as much as is needed. Whether we can transport the things up to guarantee the victory at the front, it all depends on us!"
　　Enemy aircraft constantly harass day and night, but not only does it not affect the strong rear supply work of the People's Army in the slightest, but it also arouses greater hatred among the Korean people and Chinese volunteer civilian laborers, who work with redoubled efforts. Right at this station, enemy aircraft had been bombing continuously for five days; in the five days of air combat, four enemy aircraft were shot down by our air defense forces. One morning, as the civilian laborers who had worked hard all night were sleeping and resting, five enemy aircraft attacked, and six civilian laborers were injured. This aroused the unparalleled anger of all the civilian laborers, "The more severely you harass, the more happily we work." From the day after the bombing, their speed of loading and unloading and transportation capacity increased by another 40%. A civilian laborer squad leader from Wuchang County said: "Five days of work completed in three days, two days ahead of schedule, that is advancing our final victory and the final failure of the American aggressors by two days." With everyone's concerted efforts, by the eighteenth day of the twenty-day transportation task, the transportation of various major materials had exceeded the original plan by more than 120 to 260 percent. They not only completed the rear transportation and supply tasks for the anti-American front ahead of schedule, but also tried every means to protect the materials from loss. The civilian laborers from Guo Hou Banner, Heilongjiang Province, worked hard all night, and although they were very tired, in order to avoid enemy bombing, they camouflaged all the materials. With few tools, they used their hands, handful by handful, to sprinkle snow on them until they were completely the same as the surrounding natural environment. Each of their squads prepared sewing needles, hammers, and nails. Whenever a bag was torn or a box was broken, they sewed it up and nailed it firmly. They said: "Now that the things have been transported here, we must never let them be lost even a little." Once, when loading a car, more than fifty boxes of canned goods were damaged, and beef cans were scattered and buried in the snow. The civilian laborers picked them out one by one from the deep snow, put them back into boxes, nailed them up, and transported them to the front.
　　In January of this year, at a station in Pingan South Province, I met a joint civilian labor brigade. They were all from Jilin Province and had just come from the country. They had been traveling by train all the way, but when they got here, the military representative informed them that they would have to walk from here on. The civilian laborers were not afraid of walking. They were willing to get to the front as soon as possible, so they kept asking why they could not go by car.
　　"We have an urgent transportation task," the military representative explained to everyone, "In order to give the enemy a greater blow, everyone must go on foot in order to free up vehicles to step up the transportation of ammunition and supplies."
　　"Then what are you transporting tonight?"
　　"Tonight, the first train will transport boxes of soy-braised pork, sausages, and canned goods."
　　"How heavy is a box?"
　　"Why are you asking this?" The military representative became impatient with the civilian laborers' persistent questioning, "A box is forty *jin*."
　　"Give us seven thousand boxes!" The civilian laborer captain said, "We are all from the Northeast, and everyone can make a rake; on the snowy road, walking empty-handed is the same as walking while dragging a small rake." So the civilian laborers immediately began making sleds. An hour later, some were dragging one box and some were dragging two boxes on foot. Afterwards, the military representative calculated that the materials taken away by this joint civilian labor brigade saved nearly seventy vehicles.
　　Various departments of logistics work are trying their best to save transportation capacity in order to strengthen the transportation and supply to the front. I once visited a field hospital. In one of its affiliated branches, the nurses themselves formed twenty pairs of stretchers, forty-two single-person sleds, four four-person sleds. The heavy responsibility of transferring and supplying hundreds of wounded soldiers was entirely borne by the staff of the institute, without using a single civilian laborer or a large cart.
　　The speed and agility with which the civilian laborers worked, as well as their composure and calmness in fighting enemy aircraft, are amazing. One day, at a station, enemy aircraft suddenly attacked. At that time, more than a thousand civilian laborers, hundreds of cars and horse-drawn carts, were busily transporting materials back and forth. The entire station was as crowded as a temple fair. But when the enemy aircraft swept down the first burst of machine-gun fire, the station and the roads back and forth were already empty and silent - all the people and vehicles had already cleverly hidden. After several bursts of machine-gun fire, suddenly, not far in front, someone was singing a *kuaiban*-style song:
　　"No target in the day, can't see at night
　　Don't look at the buzzing - it's all for nothing"
　　The civilian laborer captain, who was lying down with me behind a bundle of bedding, told me that these "songs" were made up by them in the midst of their hard work, one sentence at a time, and they had already made up dozens of them. Then, the civilian laborer captain slightly raised his head and asked towards the front, "Who is that, still singing at this time?"
　　"Moving your mouth won't expose the target, what are you afraid of!" The other side replied - just as a burst of machine-gun fire stopped, he heard him sing:
　　"The U.S. military came to Korea, don't know why they're fighting
　　As soon as they hear gunfire - they run around."
　　"From Europe to Asia, the battle line is too long
　　Take care of this and lose that - enough to choke on."

　　英雄的志愿援朝的中国民工们
    本报记者　田流
    在朝鲜，到处都有志愿援朝的中国民工队，为了前线的胜利，忘我地英勇战斗着。
    在火线上，民工担架队把伤员抢救下来，迅速地装上汽车或火车，运到后方去治疗；在火车站或停车场，在仓库近边，无数的民工紧张地装卸和搬运着物资；在铁路和公路旁，民工们不停地进行着抢修工作，以保证人民部队的后方运输线畅通无阻，他们的口号是：“建立摧不毁，炸不断的强大运输线”。
    民工大都来自东北农村，有的是来自北满的大草原，走了几千里路才赶到鸭绿江，现在又跟着英雄的人民部队，来到距祖国边境八百多里的朝鲜中部了。
    在通往汉城的一个火车站近旁的一座大桥，被敌机炸坏了，火车不能通过——但是，运输可不能一刻停止啊！一队中国志愿民工便担负了抢修桥梁与搬动物资的紧急而繁重的任务。他们把火车运来的物资，从江这边运到江那边，装上对面开来的火车和汽车，再运到前方去。火车运来成千上万吨的物资，都必须当夜运过江去，要不，天一亮敌机来了，就有招致损失的危险。江很宽，从这边到对岸停车场，往返足有六、七里路。每个民工一夜要运一吨甚至二吨的物资过江去；每个人都要来回跑上它十几二十趟才能完成任务。光路程，每夜就是百多里，何况肩上还压着沉重的物资哩！但民工们的口号却是：“来多少卸多少，保证当夜运过江去”。一箱酱猪肉四十斤，人人都是扛起两箱来就跑，有的还扛三箱，松江省尚志县的民工，竟有一个人扛四箱的。每个人都知道自己工作的意义；“保证前线胜利，为了前线胜利”的光荣号召鼓舞着他们。武昌县民工邢占元，一位充满着胜利信心的中年农民告诉我：“咱志愿军，没说的，连敌人都承认是世界上不可战胜的军队；咱们的后方，工人们把生产提高了一倍，农民也比去年增产了四成多粮食。前方要啥，后方给啥；要多少给多少。能不能把东西运上去，保证前方的胜利，就全看咱的啦！”
    敌机黑夜白日地不停地扰乱，不但丝毫不能影响人民军队强大的后方供应工作，反而激起了朝鲜人民和中国志愿民工更大的仇恨，以加倍的努力来工作。就在这个车站，敌机已连续地轰炸了五天；五天的空战中，被我防空部队击落四架敌机。一天早晨，紧张劳作了一夜的民工们正在睡觉休息时，五架敌机来袭，有六位民工受伤了。这引起了全体民工的无比愤怒，“你越扰乱的厉害，咱越干的欢”。从轰炸后的第二天起，他们装卸车的速度和运输能力，又提高了百分之四十。武昌县一位民工小队长说：五天的工作三天完成，提前了两天，这就是把我们的最后胜利、美国侵略者的最后失败提前了两天。在大家齐心努力下，二十天的运输任务，到十八天时，各种主要物资的运送，已经超过原计划百分之一百二十到二百六十以上。他们不仅提前完成着抗美前线的后方运输供应任务，还想尽各种办法，保护着物资不受损失。黑龙江省郭后旗地民工们，紧张劳作了一夜，虽然已是十分疲劳，但为了避免敌机轰炸，他们把全部物资都伪装起来，工具少就用手，一捧一捧的把雪撒在上面，直到和周围的自然环境完全一样时为止。他们每个小队，都准备了缝针、锤子和洋钉，遇有袋子破了，箱子摔坏了，就把它缝好钉牢。他们说：东西既然已经运到这儿，就绝不能让它再损失一点。一次装车时，有五十多个罐头箱子碰坏了，牛肉罐头散乱地埋在雪里。民工们一个一个地把它从深雪里摸出来，又装入箱子，钉好，运到前方去了。
    今年一月间，在平安南道的一个车站上，我遇见了一个联合民工大队。他们都是吉林省人，刚从国内来，一路上都是乘坐火车的，但是走到这里时，军事代表通知他们，从这儿往前去都要步行了。民工们倒不是害怕走路，他们愿意尽早地赶到前线，因此，他们追问着不能乘车前去的理由。
    “我们有一项紧急的运输任务”军事代表向大家解释：“为着给敌人更大的打击，所有的人都要步行前去，好腾出车辆来加紧运输弹药和给养。”
    “那么今夜要运什么呢？”，
    “今晚第一列车运成箱的酱肉、香肠和罐头。”
    “一箱有多重呢？”
    “你们问这干啥？”军事代表对民工们的追根究底的询问不耐烦起来：“一箱四十斤。”
    “给我们七千箱吧！”民工队长说：“咱们都是东北人，谁都会作耙犁的；在雪路上，空人走和拖着小耙犁走是一样的。”于是民工们立时动手作起雪橇来，一点钟后，有人拖着一箱有人拖着两箱步行出发了。事后军事代表一计算，这一联合民工大队捎走的物资，节省了近七十台汽车。
    后勤工作的各个部门都在尽量设法节省运输力，以加强对前线的运输供应。我曾访问了一个兵站医院。在它所属的一个分所里，护士们自己组成了二十付担架，四十二张单人拉的小雪橇，四付四人拉的大雪橇，数百个伤员的转运和供给重任，全由该所的工作人员担负起来，不使用一个民工和一辆大车。
    民工们工作的迅速、敏捷、以及在与敌机搏斗时的从容、镇定的功夫是惊人的。有一天，在一个车站上，敌机忽然来袭。当时一千多民工、数百辆汽车和马车，正匆忙地往来运送着物资。整个车站像庙会那样人多而拥挤。但当敌机扫射下第一梭机枪时，车站和往来的路上，已经是空无一人，一片寂静了——所有的人、车辆，早机敏地隐蔽起来。几阵机枪过去，忽然前面不远的地方，有人用说快板的歌调唱着：
    “白天无目标，黑夜看不着
    别看瞎嗡嗡——白闹”
    同我一起卧倒在被服包后的民工队长告诉我，这些“歌谣”是他们在紧张的工作中，你一言我一语编出来的，已经编了好几十首了。而后，民工队长微微地抬起头，向前面问道：“那是谁啊，这时候还唱歌。”
    “嘴动动又暴露不了目标，怕啥！”那边回答道——一阵机枪声刚停，又听见他唱道：
    “美军到朝鲜，不知为何战
    一听枪炮声——乱窜。”
    “欧洲到亚洲，战线过于长
    顾此就失彼——够呛。”
