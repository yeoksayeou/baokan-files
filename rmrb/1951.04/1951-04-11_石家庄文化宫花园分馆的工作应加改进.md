To the Editor:

On the afternoon of March 30th, I visited the Shijiazhuang People's Cultural Palace Garden Branch and found the books and newspapers inside in a chaotic mess, covered in dust, and no one responsible for lending books. Outside the gate of the hall, four beggars were lazily sleeping there, and no one was taking them in or managing them. It seemed like it was not a people's cultural center at all. In the market outside the Garden Branch, some book stalls and small bookstores were displaying many feudal and superstitious books, and many adults and children were gathered around reading them. This was in stark contrast to the cultural center. This situation should be changed.

专栏：来信摘要

　　石家庄文化宫花园分馆的工作应加改进编辑同志：
    三月三十日下午，我去石家庄市人民文化宫花园分馆参观，发觉里面书报乱七八糟，尘埃很多，借书也无人负责。在该馆门外，有四个乞丐懒洋洋地睡在那里，也无人收容管理。看来，简直不像人民的文化馆。而在花园分馆外面的市场上，一些书摊及小书店，都摆着很多封建迷信的书籍，并有不少成人和小孩在围着看。这和文化馆成一个强烈的对比。这种情况应该有所改变。
