To popularize and deepen the educational campaign on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station repeatedly broadcast the live recording of the expanded joint meeting of people's representatives from all walks of life in Beijing Municipality discussing the issue of punishing counter-revolutionary criminals from March 25th to 31st, which was enthusiastically welcomed by people from all walks of life in the city. The minimum number of listeners throughout the city was over 300,000. Before the broadcast, all government agencies and people's organizations in Beijing issued notices calling on their subordinates to organize the masses to listen. Many departments of the Central People's Government and the Beijing Municipal People's Government, in addition to notifying staff at all levels to pay attention to listening, also stipulated that the content of the conference recording should be used as one of the main materials for studying the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. All cultural centers, reading rooms, public security sub-bureaus, and police stations in the city mobilized citizens to listen.

During the seven days from March 25th to 31st, listening to the broadcast became a major event for the people of Beijing. On the evenings of the 27th and the noon of the 28th, the loudspeakers in front of most industrial and commercial establishments on all bustling streets in the city were broadcasting live recordings of the conference; pedestrians gathered to listen. Tricycle workers sat on their vehicles, listening intently, sometimes angry, sometimes applauding and cheering along with the plot of the recording. The staff of the Xianbing Zhou restaurant were so engrossed in listening that they even forgot to serve food to the customers. In the suburbs, recordings were organised to be listened to at any place that had radios. Many households in Haidian Town in the western suburbs had radios, and they all listened to the live recording of the conference. At noon on the 28th, the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station specially set up relay stations in Dongdan Square, Tianqiao, Haidian Town, and outside Deshengmen. There was a lot of sand and dust that day, but there were still many listeners. In the area under the jurisdiction of the Tenth Police Station in Tianqiao alone, there were three to four thousand listeners.

Judging from the listeners' reactions, this method is indeed an effective way to publicize the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in a grand and vigorous manner. On the 25th and 26th, the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station received more than 160 phone calls from various units, reporting on the listening situation and stating that they fully supported this wise measure of the government. Some even suggested that the government should kill all counter-revolutionaries who had killed people in the past. More than 600 workers at the Liulihe Cement Plant sent a letter to the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station, saying that they were very excited when they listened, as if they were really participating in the conference. Everyone expressed that they would definitely assist the government in eliminating counter-revolutionaries, and many employees have already reported hidden counter-revolutionaries to the factory's security department.

Although the live recording of the expanded joint meeting of people's representatives from all walks of life in Beijing Municipality discussing the issue of punishing counter-revolutionaries has been broadcast continuously for seven days by the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station, and the Central People's Broadcasting Station has also broadcast it nationwide, and Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Hankou, Chongqing, Xi'an and other places have also broadcast this program simultaneously, as of now, people from all walks of life in Beijing are still requesting a re-broadcast. The All-China Federation of Cooperatives and a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army reflected to the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station that they believed that broadcasting this recording to the whole city had great educational significance for cadres and citizens; they hoped that all major cities in the country would adopt this method to carry out publicity and education work on suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

　　北京市三十万以上人民
　  收听镇压反革命广播录音
    北京市人民广播电台为了普及深入镇压反革命的宣传教育，从三月二十五日至三十一日反复播送了北京市市、区各界人民代表扩大联席会议讨论惩治反革命罪犯问题的实况录音，受到全市各界人民的热烈欢迎。全市收听人数最少在三十万人以上。在播送之前，北京市各政府机关、人民团体均发出通知，号召所属届时组织群众收听。中央人民政府及北京市人民政府很多部门除通知各级工作人员注意收听外，并规定要把大会录音的内容，作为学习镇压反革命问题的主要材料之一。全市文化馆、图书阅览室及公安分局、派出所均动员市民进行收听。
    在三月二十五至三十一日七天中，收听广播成了北京市人民的一件大事。二十七日晚和二十八日中午，全市各热闹街道上绝大部分工商户门前的扩音器，都放送着大会实况录音；行人纷纷聚拢倾听。三轮车工人坐在自己的车上倾耳静听着，随着录音的情节，时而愤怒，时而拍手喝采。饀饼周饭铺的伙友们因为听得出神，甚至忘了给顾客端饭。在郊区，凡是有收音机的地方，也都组织收听了录音。西郊海甸镇有很多住户都有收音机，他们都收听了大会的实况录音。二十八日中午，北京市人民广播电台特别在东单广场、天桥、海甸镇、德胜门外等地设立了转播站。当日风沙很大，但听众仍然很多。仅天桥第十派出所所辖地区，就有三、四千人收听。
    从听众的反应来看，这种方法确是大张旗鼓镇压反革命的有效宣传方法。二十五、六两日，北京市人民广播电台曾收到一百六十多个单位的电话，报告收听情况和说明他们完全拥护政府这一英明措施。有人并提出政府应将过去杀过人的一切反革命分子都杀掉。琉璃河水泥厂六百多工人寄给北京市人民广播电台一封信，说他们收听时情绪十分激昂，像真的参加了大会一样。大家表示一定协助政府肃清反革命，并已有不少职工向工厂保卫科检举了暗藏的反革命分子。
    北京市市、区各界人民代表扩大联席会议讨论惩治反革命问题实况录音，虽经北京市人民广播电台连续播送七天，中央人民广播电台也已向全国广播，天津、济南、青岛、上海、南京、广州、汉口、重庆、西安等地也同时播送了这一节目，但截至目前，北京市各界人民还纷纷要求重播。合作总社及中国人民解放军某部向北京市人民广播电台反映：他们认为向全市播送这种录音，对干部和市民的教育意义很大；他们希望全国各大城市都采用这种方式，来进行镇压反革命的宣传教育工作。
