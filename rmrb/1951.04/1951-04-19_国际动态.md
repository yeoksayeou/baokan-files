　　Democratic Youth of Various Countries Preparing for Festival
　　Youth from various countries are actively preparing for the World Festival of Democratic Youth and Students to be held in Berlin from August 5th to 19th. The youth of the Al area of France, together with trade unions and women's groups, are launching a peace flag competition to collect signatures against the arming of West Germany. They are determined to win this flag and take it to the Berlin Festival. The youth of the Nice area are also holding a signature competition against the arming of West Germany. Many countries, including India, Australia, and Scotland, and Finland, are selecting representatives, and they have combined the struggle for peace with preparatory work.
　　German People Will Never Let Disaster Return
　　One thousand representatives from all over Germany who have suffered from fascism and war, held a conference in Gelsenkirchen in the Ruhr area on April 14 to oppose the American arming of West Germany. At the meeting, Katler, a member of the council of the "Association of Victims of Nazi Persecution," called on West German residents to intensify the struggle for peace in all inhabited areas and to find ways to hold a popular vote against the remilitarization of West Germany. Those who have suffered from fascism and war hate fascism and war even more!
