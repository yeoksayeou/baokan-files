Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 14th (TASS dispatch): The "Worker Daily" reports that the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States held an expanded meeting in New York on April 7th and 8th to discuss the issue of developing the peace movement in the United States.

　　Fain, Chairman of the Communist Party's Committee for Peace, made the main report, emphasizing that the opposition of millions of Americans to the "disastrous direction of American foreign policy" is increasing.

　　Fain pointed out: Despite the instigation of war hysteria, the American people do not support war plans. Fain emphasized that the number of peace committees has increased and specifically mentioned the "American Peace Crusade" movement, which organized a march on Washington by people advocating peace in March, which was "a significant expression in defending peace since the end of the anti-fascist war."

　　Fain pointed out that it is necessary to eliminate as soon as possible the phenomenon that the work of organizing peace forces cannot keep up with the people's desire for peace. Fain said: It is necessary to act with a united front and organize movements to defend peace in every city, every factory, every place, and all social organizations.

　　Dennis, General Secretary of the US Communist Party, spoke on the issue of the peace movement at the plenary session. He emphasized: "The broad masses of the American people must be convinced that they can use their own strength and their own independent political action to force the US government to change its foreign policy."

　　When reviewing the reasons for the insufficient development of the American peace movement, Dennis pointed out that the most important factor hindering the organization of the broadest peace front is the anti-communist and anti-Soviet role of the leadership of trade unions and social democrats.

　　Dennis said: However, these factors alone cannot explain why the peace movement remains at a low level. He called for improving the work of the Communist Party's leading organs and Communist Party members in the struggle for peace and the organization of the peace movement. Dennis proposed re-formulating the Party's entire action program for defending peace, so that the Party would make the struggle to win united action in defending peace the center of all aspects of its activities, and "more persistently, boldly, and effectively" adopt the policy of the united front and the people's front, that is, to organize workers who believe in Catholicism and social democracy to jointly defend peace. He said: It must be understood that it is not only those who oppose imperialism who should participate in the peace movement. This movement should include all individuals and groups who hope to stop a third world war, regardless of their views on communism or the origins of the danger of war.

　　Hall, Secretary of the US Communist Party National Committee, particularly pointed out in summarizing the discussion: American imperialism is encountering serious difficulties in implementing its war plans. The crisis in American foreign policy, which has been deepened by military failures in Korea, worldwide opposition to American aggression, the sharpening of contradictions within the Anglo-American bloc, and the growing desire for peace within the United States, all indicate that the struggle for peace can be victorious.

　　美共全国委员会开扩大会议
　  讨论发展全国和平运动问题
　  但尼斯提议重新制定保卫和平的行动纲领
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社纽约十四日讯：“工人日报”报道，美国共产党全国委员会于四月七、八两日在纽约举行扩大会议，讨论了在美国发展和平运动的问题。
    共产党争取和平委员会主席范因作了主要的报告，他强调指出成百万的美国人对“造成灾难的美国外交政策方针”的反对日益增大。
    范因指出：尽管有人煽动战争歇斯底里，可是美国人民并不支持战争计划。范因着重指出和平委员会的数目已经增加，并特别提到“美国和平十字军”的运动，这个运动在三月份曾组织拥护和平的人民向华盛顿进军，这是“反法西斯战争结束以来在保卫和平上意义重大的一次表示”。
    范因指出：必须尽速消除组织和平力量的工作赶不上人民和平愿望的这种现象。范因说：必须以统一战线来行动，并在每一个城市、每一个工厂、每一个地方和所有的社会组织里组织起保卫和平的运动。
    美共总书记但尼斯在全会上发言时，详细论到和平运动的问题。他强调说：“必须使美国的广大人民群众相信，他们可以用自己的力量与自己的独立的政治行动强使美国政府改变它的外交政策。”
    但尼斯在检讨美国和平运动发展不足的原因时指出，妨碍组织最广泛的和平战线的最重要因素，是工会领导机构与社会民主分子的反共、反苏作用。
    但尼斯说：可是，单是这些因素并不能说明为什么和平运动停留在低下的水平上。他号召改善共产党领导机关与共产党员在争取和平斗争和组织和平运动方面的工作。但尼斯提议重新制定党在保卫和平方面的整个行动纲领，使党把在保卫和平方面争取统一行动的斗争作为各方面活动的中心，并“更加坚持不渝地、大胆地与有效地”采取统一战线与人民战线的政策，即组织与信仰天主教和社会民主主义的工人共同保卫和平的行动。他说：必须了解，应该参加保卫和平运动的不仅是反对帝国主义的人们。这个运动应当包括一切希望制止第三次世界大战的个人与团体，不管他们对共产主义或对战争危险的起源的看法如何。
    美共全国委员会书记霍尔在总结讨论时特别指出：美国帝国主义在执行它的战争计划时碰到严重的困难。由于在朝鲜的军事失败而加深了的美国外交政策的危机、全世界对美国侵略行为的反对、美英集团内部矛盾的尖锐化与美国国内日益增长的和平愿望，所有这一切都表明，争取和平的斗争是可以胜利的。
