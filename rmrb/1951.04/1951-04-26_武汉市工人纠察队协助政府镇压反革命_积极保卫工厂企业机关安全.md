　　The Wuhan Workers' Militia Assists the Government in Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries
　  Actively Protects the Safety of Factories, Enterprises, and Institutions
    The Wuhan Workers' Militia actively assists the People's Government in suppressing counter-revolutionary elements and protecting the safety of factories, enterprises, and institutions. After its establishment on "February 7th" this year, the Wuhan Workers' Militia General Team began to rectify the workers' militia in important factories, enterprises, and institutions throughout the city, and conducted basic political education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, as well as the nature and tasks of the militia, and preliminary military technical education for the militia members. Currently, there are more than 7,000 workers' militia members in the city. They have generally realized the importance of protecting factories, enterprises, and institutions, and are working very hard. They take turns on duty and cooperate with the safety groups of their respective units to carry out patrols, sentry duty, and questioning of pedestrians. Many members remained at their posts during the Spring Festival holidays. Various militia teams have established work systems such as handover shifts and militia discipline.
    Due to their hard work, the safety situation of factories and enterprises has greatly improved. For example, the Wuhan Chemical Factory, which had its power lines cut many times by counter-revolutionary elements, thus affecting production, has not experienced any more sabotage incidents since the militia patrolmen uncovered an incident of counter-revolutionary elements cutting the power lines. In the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the militia members organized study of the regulations on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the reports of the leaders, actively reported and assisted the Public Security Bureau in arresting counter-revolutionary elements. Liu Hui, a member of the Jiang'an Inspection Section of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, discovered that the special agent Shi Yukui was spreading rumors and sabotage, immediately investigated secretly, and reported to the Public Security Bureau to have him arrested. The militia members of many factories went deep into the workshops to explain the principles of suppressing counter-revolutionaries to the workers, and played an active leading role in denouncing the crimes of special agents.

　　武汉市工人纠察队协助政府镇压反革命
　  积极保卫工厂企业机关安全
    武汉市工人纠察队积极协助人民政府镇压反革命分子，保卫工厂、企业、机关的安全。武汉市工人纠察总队在今年“二七”成立后，即着手整顿了全市重要工厂企业单位的工人纠察队，向纠察队员进行了抗美援朝及纠察队的性质、任务等基本政治教育和初步军事技术教育。现在全市工人纠察队员共七千多人。他们已普遍认识到保卫工厂、企业、机关的重要性，工作非常努力。他们轮流守更，并配合本单位的安全小组进行巡逻、放哨、盘问行人等工作。许多队员在春节假日仍坚守工作岗位。各纠察队已建立了交接班等工作制度和纠察纪律。
    由于他们努力工作，工厂、企业的安全情况现已大有改进。如曾多次被反革命分子割断电线因而影响生产的武汉化学工厂，自从纠察队巡逻员查获一次反革命分子割电线的事件后，至今再未发生破坏事件。在镇压反革命工作中，纠察队员们有组织地学习了镇压反革命条例和首长们的报告，积极检举和协助公安局逮捕反革命分子。郑州铁路局江岸检车段队员刘辉发现特务石玉奎造谣破坏，立即暗中调查，并报告公安局将他逮捕。许多工厂的纠察队员深入车间，向工人们讲镇压反革命的道理，并在控诉特务分子的罪恶中，起了积极的带头作用。
