A Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Heilongjiang Province Tongbei County Federation of Trade Unions:
    Strengthening Leadership over Trade Unions in State-Owned Enterprises in the Future

    To the Editorial Department:
    After reading the criticisms of the Tongbei County Federation of Trade Unions by comrades Wang Shanyuan and Shi Zhongxiao published in the "Readers' Letters" section of the People's Daily on March 14th, all members of our county Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting for self-criticism. We deeply feel that in the leadership of the County Federation of Trade Unions Committee, our consideration of issues was not comprehensive enough. In the past, we believed that most employees of state-owned enterprises had received education, so we only focused on leading the trade unions of private enterprises, and relaxed the leadership over the trade unions of state-owned enterprises. Secondly, the development of trade union organizations in our county has been very rapid recently. In June last year, only seven grassroots trade unions were established in Tongbei County. Now, it has developed to twenty-one grassroots trade unions, as well as a county education trade union and a district-town trade union. Therefore, the County Federation of Trade Unions lacked planning in its leadership, and only paid attention to the newly established trade unions. These shortcomings deserve serious efforts from the County Federation of Trade Unions to overcome in future work.

    In addition, there are a few points in the criticisms of comrades Wang and Shi that need clarification. For example, the manuscript stated: "The chairman and members of the County Federation of Trade Unions have never been to lower-level branches." We feel that this is not in accordance with the facts. Taking March as an example, county trade union cadres visited the lower-level construction trade union five or six times. Secondly, it was said that "most employees have not joined the trade union." (The original authors were referring to a single unit of the Tongbei County Department Store - Editor). In fact, according to incomplete statistics in Tongbei County, trade union members account for 79.3% of the total number of employees. Of course, we are not satisfied with the existing achievements, and we will work harder in the future.

### 黑龙江省通北县总工会  今后要加强对公营企业工会的领导

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    黑龙江省通北县总工会
    今后要加强对公营企业工会的领导编辑同志：
    看到人民日报三月十四日读者来信专页刊登王善元、史忠孝同志对通北县工会的批评后，我们县工会全体委员即开会进行检讨。我们深感到在县工会委员会的领导上，考虑问题不够全面，过去我们认为公营企业职工大部都受过教育，所以只偏重于领导私营企业的工会；放松了对公营企业的工会的领导。其次，我县最近工会组织发展很快，在去年六月间，通北全县才成立了七个基层工会，现在发展到二十一个基层工会，还有一个县教育工会，一个区镇工会。因此，县工会在领导上就缺乏计划，只是注意了新成立的工会。这些缺点都值得县工会在今后工作中努力克服。
    另外，对王、史二同志的批评，也有个别地方需要解释。如该稿中说：“县工会主席及委员从来没有到过下级分会。”我们觉得这不合事实。就拿三月份说，县工会干部到下级建筑工会就有五、六次。其次如说：“大部分职工没有参加工会。”（原作者系指通北县百货公司一个单位——编者）事实上通北全县据不完全的统计，工会会员占全体职工人数的百分之七十九点三强。当然，我们并不满足现有成绩，我们今后要更加努力工作。
