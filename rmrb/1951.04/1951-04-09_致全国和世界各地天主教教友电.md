　　To Catholic Believers Nationwide and Worldwide:

　　Dear Catholic believers across the country and around the world, our Catholic Church is the holy church established by our Lord Jesus, a religion that propagates the true spirit of God's salvation and love for mankind. However, for the past hundred years, it has been exploited by imperialism and has become the vanguard of aggression. A series of facts, ironclad evidence displayed in history, are clearly verifiable and cause people heartache.

　　Imperialist elements are taking every opportunity to spread rumors, hoping for a third world war, and using atomic bombs to intimidate people, engaging in espionage activities to subvert our motherland and undermine world peace. They are also abusing divine authority, threatening those un-fooled believers with suspension from divine service and hell, and secretly setting up radio stations to conduct organized espionage activities.

　　We, the 15,000 Catholic believers in Tianjin, want to eliminate this group of scum, sever all ties with imperialism, and ensure that the Holy Church in China is no longer controlled and exploited by imperialism. We want to establish an autonomous, self-supporting, and self-propagating church, unite, recognize the enemy and ourselves, and strive for the cause of our Lord Jesus under the principles of loving the country and loving the Church. We hope that Catholic believers across the country will no longer be deceived by imperialism, and we are determined to drive them out of Chinese territory.

　　We would also like to announce to all good-hearted believers around the world: We absolutely have freedom of religious belief in New China. We hope you will not listen to the rumors of imperialist elements. They are the scum of the Holy Church, they are the running dogs of Wall Street, they are the destroyers of peace. We hope you will support the just actions of patriotic and religious Catholic believers in China.

　　With Respects,
              The Founding Assembly of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association
　　April 7, 1951

　　致全国和世界各地天主教教友电
    亲爱的全国和全世界各地的天主教教友们，我们天主教是秉承吾主耶稣所建立的圣教会，是传扬天主救世爱人真精神的宗教。但是近百年来，受了帝国主义的利用，变成了侵略的先锋队，一连串的事实，铁一般的证据摆在历史上，斑斑可考，会人痛心。
    帝国主义分子更利用各种机会，散布谣言，希望第三次世界战争，并以原子弹恐吓人民，进行特务活动，颠覆我们祖国，破坏世界和平，他们更滥用神权，对不受蒙蔽的教友，以停神功、下地狱，来威胁教友，并私设电台，进行有组织的特务活动。
    我们天津市一万五千教友，要肃清这群败类，和帝国主义割断一切连系，使中国的圣教会不再受帝国主义的把持和利用。我们要建立一个自治、自养、自传的教会，团结起来，认清敌我，在爱国爱教的纲领下，为吾主耶稣的事业而奋斗。我们希望全国的教友亦不要再受帝国主义的欺骗，我们坚决地要把他们赶出中国地面去。
    我们还愿意向全世界善良的教友们宣布：我们在新中国是绝对有信教自由的，希望你们不要听帝国主义分子的谣言，他们是圣教会的败类，他们是华尔街的走狗，他们是和平的破坏者，希望你们支持中国爱国爱教天主教徒的正义行动。
    此致敬礼
              天津市天主教革新运动促进会成立大会
    一九五一年四月七日
