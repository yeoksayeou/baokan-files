Xinhua News Agency, 21st: Vietnam News Agency reported: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has decided to launch a nationwide production increase competition movement starting on May 1st to celebrate International Labor Day. The goals of the competition movement are to increase the production of grain, cotton, livestock and poultry, munitions and medicines, and to develop small-scale industries to meet the needs of the military and civilians, enabling a long-term war of resistance and preparing conditions for a general counter-offensive.

The Lien Viet Front's newspaper, *Cuu Quoc,* recently published an editorial on this issue, calling on Vietnamese farmers to intensify the production competition movement so that this year can become what President Ho Chi Minh called "a year of victorious harvests." The editorial emphasized the importance of agricultural production, which is the main goal of this competition.

The Lien Viet Front cadres at all levels have guaranteed to mobilize all members and the people to participate in the production increase competition movement. In addition to calling on farms to intensify production, the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and the Farmers' National Salvation Association have also called on troops, party and government cadres, and students to actively participate in land reclamation and livestock breeding.

　　越南人民迎接“五一”节
　  将发动大规模增产竞赛
    【新华社二十一日讯】越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国政府已决定从五月一日开始，发动一个全国规模的增加生产竞赛运动，以此庆祝“五一”劳动节。竞赛运动的目标是增加粮食、棉花、家畜和家禽、军火和药品的生产，发展小型工业，以满足军民的需要，使能进行长期抗战，并为总反攻准备条件。
    越联阵线机关报《救国报》最近曾就此问题发表社论，号召越南农民加紧展开生产竞赛运动，使今年能够成为胡志明主席所说的“胜利收获年”。社论强调农业生产的重要性，农业生产是这次竞赛的主要目标。
    越联阵线的各级干部已保证动员全体会员和人民，参加增加生产的竞赛运动。越南农业部和农民救国会除号召农场加紧生产外，并号召部队、党政干部、学生等积极参加开垦和饲养家畜的工作。
