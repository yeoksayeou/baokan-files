How can the Resist America, Aid Korea and the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movements be combined in factories? Concrete answers have been found at the Chongqing No. 610 Cotton Mill.

　　At the beginning of the Korean War launched by US imperialism, the thoughts of the workers at the No. 610 Cotton Mill were quite chaotic, and there were many rumors within the factory. Pei Xibi, a member of the Communist Youth League, received a notice to study in Shanghai and was initially very happy, but after the Korean War broke out, after hearing rumors, he was afraid that Shanghai would be bombed, and he dared not go. Some other workers also had varying degrees of fear of the US.

　　However, since the factory conducted current affairs education on Resist America, Aid Korea for its workers and launched a struggle against counter-revolutionaries, the above situation has changed, and the political consciousness of the workers has been rapidly improved, and the production outlook has been renewed. The main experiences are as follows:

　　First, combine workers' cultural studies with current affairs education for workers. In the beginning, the factory used to conduct current affairs propaganda by giving reports, but the effect was not great. Later, it adopted the method of combining it with the teaching of workers' spare-time schools. On November 20 last year, it established a factory-wide current affairs study committee, using "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Defend the Country," "US Imperialism is the Mortal Enemy of the Chinese People," "The Atomic Bomb Issue," and "The Soviet Union-led Peace and Democracy Camp is Invincible" as the content, and compiled and printed four kinds of workers' cultural textbooks for literacy, primary, intermediate, and advanced levels, and carried out teaching in workers' spare-time schools. Teachers used maps and stories to explain to the workers "Where is Korea" and "What is the 38th Parallel." This not only met the workers' requirements for cultural learning, but also improved their political understanding. The workers welcomed this kind of teaching material and teaching method very much. They said: This kind of textbook is really good, we have learned culture, and we have also understood world affairs, and we know that the United States not only invades Korea, but also invades China. Therefore, the number of workers who regularly participated in spare-time school learning increased sharply, from only 300 people participating in learning in the past to 1,000 people now. At the same time, the Party branch also held current affairs training classes, each lasting one week, so that 1,800 workers received education. In addition, the factory also conducted current affairs education for workers through picture exhibitions, dramas, movies, radio, big-character posters, and blackboards. In the picture exhibition, in coordination with the propaganda of Resist America, Aid Korea, the photo exhibition of the Kuomintang bandit gang's massacre of revolutionary martyrs at the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization" when they fled Chongqing was held, which aroused the workers' great hatred for the US and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents.

　　Second, based on the workers' preliminary understanding of the task of Resist America, Aid Korea and their incomparable hatred for secret agents, unfold accusations against counter-revolutionaries according to the specific conditions of the factory. At the accusation meeting, workers in three large groups burst into tears. They associated the American-made torture instruments used by the secret agents with the atrocities of the US military in Chongqing; out of hatred for the secret agents and the US military, they further understood why they should support the Korean people who are fighting heroically against US imperialism. They wanted to resist America and aid Korea with practical actions of production competition. The process of the factory launching this accusation movement was: in the process of carrying out patriotic production competitions, the trade union found that the production competition of the focus group, Class A, Fine Yarn Group One, had not been launched, and the production plan could never be completed. Eight workers in the group did not participate in production meetings, or participated but did not speak, and went to bed after work. The factory leaders deeply studied the reasons for this phenomenon. After Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members talked to them several times, they learned that the group leader, Shi Yuhua, was originally a secret agent and bandit. She did not allow the workers to produce well, threatened the workers that the Kuomintang would come back to kill activists, and provoked the relationship between the workers and the Communist Youth League members. The workers exposed Shi Yuhua's crimes and unanimously demanded to struggle against her. On February 27, the factory held an accusation meeting and detained Shi Yuhua. As a result, the production enthusiasm of all the workers in Group One increased rapidly, and on that day, the yarn output exceeded the original plan by 66%. The successful experience of Group One was quickly promoted to the whole factory, and many groups reported the secret agents in their groups. As of the end of March, the factory had held more than 20 accusation meetings and reported 25 secret agents. It was these secret agents who desperately spread rumors after the Korean War broke out. After the suppression of these secret agents, the production enthusiasm of all the workers in the factory was greatly improved. In the first quarter of this year, production exceeded the original plan by 0.35%, the white flowers of fine yarn were reduced from 120 pounds to 40 pounds per group, and the reeling floss was 1.6 pounds per day in the past, but now it has dropped to 0.6 pounds.

　　Third, in the struggle against counter-revolutionaries, a large-scale current affairs material reading group was established, so that current affairs learning became regular. This work is mainly carried out through the following three methods: 1. Each class in the workers' spare-time school forms a reading group, reading twice a week, and there are now 33 groups; 2. Mobilize workers with higher education levels who have not participated in spare-time school learning to form spare-time reading groups, reading five times a week, and there are now five groups; 3. Organize reading groups based on trade union member groups, and carry out reading before or after spare-time school classes, and there are now 13 groups. In total, there are 51 reading groups in the factory, with 1,822 participants. Through the reading groups, the current affairs propaganda network was expanded, and the struggle against secret agents was also closely coordinated. After reading the news about Chongqing's arrest of secret agents, each reading group deepened its hatred for the enemy; after reading the communication about banning the Yiguandao sect, it launched accusations against the Yiguandao sect; through the accusations, the Yiguandao sect followers among the workers declared their withdrawal from the sect. Because the more than 100 workers in the spare-time newspaper reading group have a higher cultural level and more reading time, they are now planning to train them to become readers, as the backbone to lead the reading of each trade union member reading group, and gradually cultivate and develop them into propagandists. Many members of the spare-time newspaper reading group also conduct current affairs propaganda to the masses, expanding the influence of the reading group. Through current affairs education, the political consciousness of the workers in the factory has now been improved. The results of a recent current affairs test conducted among 700 workers were: 95% answered correctly to "Why Resist America, Aid Korea?"; 96% had a correct understanding of the atomic bomb issue; 100% believed that the Soviet Union was our most reliable friend; and 97% recognized US imperialism as an aggressor.

　　Fourth, pay attention to discovering and eliminating "blank spots" in the movement. When most of the workers in the factory had been involved in the upsurge of current affairs learning, female workers with children and female workers who were followers of Yiguandao sect were still standing outside the movement circle; the two accounted for 3.6% of the total number of people in the factory. After the factory checked and found this situation, it organized the nannies in the nursery to teach them literacy for the former; for the latter, it specifically called them together and mobilized them to accuse the Yiguandao sect leaders of their crimes. The results were very good. Now only a very small number of female workers who are followers of Yiguandao sect have not yet changed their understanding.

　　重庆市六一○纱厂结合镇压反革命推进抗美援朝运动
　　李洪勋
    工厂中的抗美援朝与镇压反革命运动如何结合进行？在重庆市六一○纱厂找到了具体的答案。
    美帝国主义发动朝鲜战争之初，六一○纱厂职工的思想相当混乱，厂内谣言很多。青年团员裴锡碧曾接到调上海学习的通知，最初很高兴，朝鲜战争起来后，听了谣言，怕上海被炸，不敢去了。还有其他一些工人具有程度不等的恐美心理。
    但该厂自对职工进行了抗美援朝时事教育，并发起对反革命分子的斗争之后，便改变了上述情况，使职工政治觉悟迅速提高，生产面貌为之一新。其主要经验有如下几点：
    第一、结合工人文化学习，对工人进行时事教育。在开始的时候，该厂曾用做报告的方式进行时事宣传，但效果不大。后来就采取与职工业余学校的教学相结合的办法，于去年十一月二十日成立了全厂的时事学习委员会，以“抗美援朝保家卫国”、“美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌”、“原子弹问题”、“以苏联为首的和平民主阵营力量无敌”等为内容，自己编印了识字、初级、中级、高级四种工人文化课本，在职工业余学校中进行教学。教师通过地图、故事向工人讲解了“朝鲜在那里”、“什么叫三八线”等。这样不但满足了工人的文化学习要求，又提高了他们的政治认识。工人对于这种教材和教学方法极为欢迎。他们说：这种课本真好，我们又学习了文化，又明白了世界大事，晓得了美国不但侵略朝鲜，还侵略中国。因此，经常参加职工业余学校学习的工人数目激增，从前只有三百人参加学习，现在就有一千人了。同时又由党的支部举办时事训练班，每期的时间是一个星期，使一千八百个工人受到教育。此外，该厂还通过了图片展览、戏剧、电影、广播、大字报、黑板报等对职工进行了时事教育。在图片展览中，与抗美援朝的宣传相配合，着重地举办了蒋介石匪帮自重庆溃逃时，在“中美合作所”残杀革命志士的照片展览，激起了职工对美、蒋特务的极大仇恨。
    第二、基于职工对抗美援朝任务的初步了解、对特务分子的无比仇恨，根据该厂的具体情况，展开对反革命分子的控诉。在控诉会上，有三个大组的职工都失声痛哭。她们从特务们使用的美制刑具，联想到美军在重庆的暴行；由痛恨特务，痛恨美军，而进一步明白了为什么要支援正与美帝国主义进行英勇斗争的朝鲜人民的道理。她们要以生产竞赛的实际行动来抗美援朝。该厂发动这种控诉运动的经过是：在进行爱国生产竞赛的过程中，工会方面发现重点组甲班细纱一大组的生产竞赛没有展开，生产计划总是不能完成。该组有八个工人不参加生产会议，或参加而不发言，下班后就睡觉。该厂领导方面就深入地研究发生这种现象的原因。经共产党员、青年团员对他们进行几次谈话之后，了解到该组组长石玉华原来是一个特务匪徒，她不许工友好好生产，威吓工人说国民党回来要杀掉积极分子，并挑拨工人群众与青年团员的关系。工人们揭发了石玉华的罪行，并一致要求斗争她。二月二十七日，该厂召开了控诉大会，并扣押了石玉华。一大组全体工人的生产情绪因此迅速提高，在当天，出纱量就超过了原计划的六十六车。一大组的胜利经验，很快推向全厂，很多组都检举了本组的特务分子。截至三月底止，该厂共召开过二十多次控诉会，检举了二十五个特务。就是这些特务分子，在朝鲜战争起后，拚命散布谣言。镇压了这些特务分子之后，全厂职工的生产情绪就都大大提高起来。今年第一季度生产超过原计划百分之零点三五，细纱的白花每组由一百二十磅减低到四十磅，摇纱回丝过去每天为一点六磅，现在则降到零点六磅。
    第三、在与反革命分子斗争中，又建立了大规模的时事材料阅读组，使时事学习转为经常化。这一工作主要是通过下面三种方式进行的：一、职工业余学校的每个班组成一个阅读组，每周阅读二次，现共有三十三个组；二、发动文化程度较高而未参加业余学校学习的工友，组成业余阅读组，每周阅读五次，现共有五组；三、以工会会员小组为单位组织阅读组，在业余学校上课前或上课后，进行阅读，现共有十三组。以上合计，全厂共有五十一个阅读组，有一千八百二十二人参加。通过阅读组，扩大了时事宣传网，也紧密地配合了反对特务的斗争。各阅读组读过重庆市逮捕特务的新闻后，加深了对敌人的仇恨；读过有关取缔一贯道的通讯后，展开了对一贯道的控诉；通过控诉，工人中的一贯道徒纷纷声明退道。因为业余读报组的一百多个工友文化水平较高，阅读时间也较多，现正计划培养她们成为阅读员，作为领导各工会会员阅读组进行阅读的骨干，并逐渐培养与发展成为宣传员。许多业余读报组员，并向群众进行时事宣传，扩大了阅读组的影响。通过时事教育，目前该厂工人的政治觉悟已提高一步。最近在七百个工人中举行的时事测验结果是：对“为什么要抗美援朝？”回答得对的有百分之九十五；对原子弹问题有正确认识的，有百分之九十六；认为苏联是我们最可靠的朋友的，占百分之百；认识美帝国主义是侵略者的，占百分之九十七。
    第四、注意发现和消灭运动中的“空白点”。当该厂绝大部分职工都已卷入时事学习的热潮之后，有小孩的女工和一贯道徒女工仍站在运动圈外；两者占全厂总人数的百分之三·六。该厂经过检查发现这种情况之后，对前一种人，组织了抚儿室的保母教她们识字；对后一种人专门召集她们，发动她们控诉一贯道头子的罪恶。结果效果都很好。现在仅有极少数的一贯道徒女工，在认识上仍未转变。
