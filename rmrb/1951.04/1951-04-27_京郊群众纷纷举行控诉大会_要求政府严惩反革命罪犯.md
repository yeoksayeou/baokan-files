The masses in the suburbs of Beijing have been holding accusation rallies one after another, demanding that the government severely punish counter-revolutionary criminals.

Since Beijing held expanded conferences of people's representatives from the city and districts to accuse counter-revolutionary elements, and the Beijing Municipal People's Government accepted the people's opinions and executed a group of counter-revolutionary elements who had committed heinous crimes, the broad masses of citizens cheered and actively reported counter-revolutionary elements to the government. In the suburban areas, the masses in various places held accusation rallies one after another, accusing the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements and demanding that the government redress their grievances and avenge them. On April 23, the masses in the eastern suburbs held an accusation rally in Gaobeidian, accusing the crimes of the special agent Fang Deyuan, the local tyrant Zhou Shangde, and others. On the same day, the masses in the northern suburbs also held accusation rallies in Wudaomiao and Qinghe Town, accusing the local tyrant Liu Yongquan, Wu Delu, the reactionary landlord Wang Desheng, and others. On the 24th and 25th, the masses in the areas under the jurisdiction of the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau (both inner and outer districts) and the southern suburbs also held accusation rallies.

At these accusation rallies, those who had been persecuted by counter-revolutionary elements and their family members tearfully recounted the suffering they had endured in the past. When Li Kuan's wife accused the Kuomintang special agent Wu Delu of the tragic killing of her husband at the accusation rally in Qinghe Town, she said, "My husband was force-fed with cold water mixed with millet until he bled from all seven orifices, buried alive halfway, and then dragged out and beaten to death." She pointed at Wu Delu and cursed, "You bastard, in the old society you held the sun in your hands, making the poor live in darkness; now the sun has come out, and I demand that the government avenge me!" Zhao Pan, at the accusation rally in Baiyanzhuang, accused the local tyrant landlord Wang Desheng of killing her husband and father-in-law, and many people were saddened to tears. Shao Rong from Madian Village, who had rarely cried in his forty-odd years of life, soaked half of his cotton-padded coat with tears at this accusation rally. Those who did not have time to accuse verbally wrote accusation letters, demanding that the People's Government severely punish these counter-revolutionary elements and avenge everyone's grievances.

The Beijing Municipal People's Government is now collecting evidence of the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements and listening to the accusations and opinions of the broad masses of the people against counter-revolutionary elements in order to correctly implement the policy of resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

　　京郊群众纷纷举行控诉大会
    要求政府严惩反革命罪犯
    自北京市举行市、区各界人民代表扩大会议，对反革命分子进行控诉，北京市人民政府接受人民意见处决了一批罪大恶极的反革命分子后，广大市民欢声雷动，纷纷向政府检举反革命分子；郊区各地群众纷纷举行控诉大会，控诉反革命分子的罪行，要求政府替他们伸冤报仇。四月二十三日，东郊的群众在高碑店举行了控诉大会，控诉特务方德元、恶霸周尚德等的罪行。北郊群众亦于同日在五道庙、清河镇两地举行控诉会，控诉恶霸刘永泉、吴德禄、反动地主王德胜等。二十四、二十五两日，公安局内四分局、外四分局辖区及南郊等地的群众也举行了控诉大会。
    在这些控诉会上，受反革命分子迫害的人和他们的家属，都痛哭流涕地诉说了当年受害的经过。李宽的妻子在清河镇的控诉会上，控诉中统特务吴德禄杀害她丈夫的惨痛经过时说：“我的丈夫被他用凉水掺小米灌得七窍流血，活埋了半截，又拉出来打死了。”她指着吴德禄骂道：“你这个忘八孙子，在旧社会你把太阳捏在手里，使穷人在暗无天日中过生活；现在太阳出来了，我要求政府给我报仇！”赵潘氏在柏彦庄的控诉会上，控诉恶霸地主王德胜害死她的丈夫和公公时，许多人都难过得流泪。马店村的邵容，活了四十多年轻易没哭过，在这次控诉会上，他却把半边棉袄都擦湿了。来不及控诉的人，纷纷写控诉状，要求人民政府严惩这些反革命分子，给大家报仇雪恨。
    北京市人民政府现正收集反革命分子的罪行罪证，听取广大人民群众对反革命分子的控诉和意见，以便正确执行坚决镇压反革命政策。
