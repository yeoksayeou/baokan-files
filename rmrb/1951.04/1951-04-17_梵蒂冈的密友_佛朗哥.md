　　Franco, the "orphaned son" of German and Italian Fascism, is not alone. Not only can his direct relatives be found in the White House, the Palais de Chaillot, and Buckingham Palace, but he also has a close partner - the Vatican and some of the imperialists it controls.

　　"Inside Spain
　　It Will Be Our Good Friend in Anti-Communism"
　　This was the title of an article in the Nanjing *Yishi Zhoukan* (the organ of the Catholic Church in China at the time) three years ago. In this article, Franco was described as a person "without any political ambition." Everyone knows that between 1936 and 1939, the blood of the people of the Spanish Republic was shed on the pastures south of the Pyrenees under Franco's butcher knife, but here the executioner was praised as "worthy of the praise and praise of mankind all over the world." The author also quoted Stoddard as saying: "The traditional religious spirit of the Golden Age of Spain has now been revived, and the government has openly declared that in matters relating to labor, economy, and society, Spain takes the social encyclicals of Popes Leo XIII, Pius XI, and Pius XII as its basic policy." However, the result of the implementation of this so-called "basic policy" is that the official price of food in Spain has risen by an average of 50 percent in the past year alone, and the living standard of the people has fallen to one-sixth of what it was in 1936; from 1945 to 1949, more than 100,000 patriotic people were thrown into prison or killed.

　　The Catholic organ *Yishi Zhoukan* is so happy to promote Franco, not because he usually kneels in front of the altar for one to four hours before "executing major events"; but because he sent his "Blue Division" to Hitler and Mussolini, the fascist culprits, as a "anti-Soviet crusade" during World War II. The German, Italian and Japanese fascists were finished in World War II, but this Catholic organ still has the courage to say shamelessly in this article: "If World War III unfortunately occurs, in the entire European war, Spain will be our (the Vatican and some of the imperialists it controls) most loyal ally." Now, World War III has not yet occurred, but the Vatican's other "good friend," American imperialism, and Franco are very close and praise each other.

　　The thinking between the Vatican, Washington, and Madrid is as harmonious as milk and water. These bandits who replace holy water with blood plasma and swastikas with crosses, these imperialists and their lackeys who befriend Franco and take pride in boasting about the Falange are today imitating and shouting for the American war-mongers. People will understand their sinful collusion and ambition from the traces of history.

### 梵蒂冈的密友——佛朗哥

　　梵蒂冈的密友——佛朗哥
    乃
    德、意法西斯的“孤臣孽子”佛朗哥是并不孤单的，不但在白宫、夏乐宫和白金汉宫能够找到他的嫡系亲属，而且他还有着亲密伙伴——梵蒂冈及其所掌握的某些帝国主义分子。
    “西班牙内幕
      它将是我们反共的好友”
    这是三年前南京《益世周刊》（当时中国天主教会的机关刊物）上一篇文章的标题。在这篇文章里，佛朗哥被它描述成《丝毫没有政治野心》的人物。谁都知道，在一九三六至一九三九年间，在佛朗哥的屠刀下，西班牙共和国人民的鲜血洒遍了比利牛斯山南麓的牧场，这里却称颂刽子手为“值得全世界人类的讴歌和赞扬”。作者还引用斯彻斯德的话说：“西班牙黄金时代传统的宗教精神现在已经复活了，政府公开宣布，在有关劳工、经济、社会各种问题上，西班牙以教宗利奥十三、庇护十一和庇护十二等的社会性的通牒为基本政策。”然而就是这个所谓“基本政策”执行的结果：仅在去年一年中，西班牙食物的官定价格平均就上涨了百分之五十，人民生活的水平，已降到一九三六年的六分之一；从一九四五年到一九四九年四年中间，十余万爱国志士被投进牢狱或被杀害。
    天主教机关刊物《益世周刊》之所以如此乐于推崇佛朗哥，不是因为他在“处决重大事件以前，他通常以一点钟至四点钟的工夫长跪圣体台前”外；而是因为他曾在第二次世界大战中派遣他的“蓝色师团”投奔到法西斯罪魁希特勒和墨索里尼麾下充当过“反苏十字军”，第二次世界大战中德意日法西斯完蛋了，但这个天主教的机关却犹有余勇，这篇文章大言不惭地说：“如果第三次世界大战不幸发生，在整个欧战中，西班牙将是我们（梵蒂冈及其所掌握的某些帝国主义分子）最忠实的盟友。”现在，第三次世界大战还未发生，但梵蒂冈的另一个“好友”美帝国主义，和佛朗哥就十分亲密地互相称赞了。
    梵蒂冈、华盛顿、马德里之间的思想是水乳交融的，这些以血浆代替圣水、以卍字代替十字架的匪徒们，这些以佛朗哥为友，以吹嘘长枪党为荣的帝国主义分子及其走狗今天又在依样画葫芦地为美国战争贩子们摇旗呐喊。人们从历史的痕迹中会明白他们罪恶的勾当和野心。
