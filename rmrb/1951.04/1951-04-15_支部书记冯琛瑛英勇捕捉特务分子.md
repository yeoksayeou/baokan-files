　　Branch Secretary Feng Chenying Heroically Captures Special Agent
　　Comrade Feng Chenying, secretary of the Cheng Village branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Ronghe County, Shanxi Province, was commended by the Ronghe County Party Committee for his heroic capture of a special agent. Not long ago, the Ronghe County Public Security Bureau discovered a special agent organization plotting to organize a riot. At that time, Comrade Feng Chenying, the secretary of the Cheng Village branch, was studying at the county party committee's党员 training class. The county party committee sent him back to the village overnight to investigate the actions of Liu Qin, the leader of this special agent organization. Liu Qin was not at home at the time. Feng Chenying then cooperated with public security cadres to investigate everywhere. Soon, Liu Qin was caught in Tianxing Temple. However, because the district government's detention center was not strictly guarded, Liu Qin escaped. Comrade Feng Chenying immediately cooperated with public security cadres to understand the situation from various sources, determined that Liu Qin had not gone far, and would come back to ask his wife to escape together. Therefore, Feng Chenying, Zhang Zhixue, Zhang Shuke, Chen Kezhi, and village correspondent Xiao Wang took turns monitoring Liu Qin's home for four days and four nights. On the fourth night, at midnight, Feng Chenying finally saw Liu Qin carrying a hoe back from outside. Comrade Feng Chenying immediately hid behind the door to prepare to capture him, but Liu Qin discovered him and砍 at Feng Chenying's head with a hoe. Feng Chenying's head was immediately cut with a triangular opening, and a lot of blood flowed out. But Feng Chenying, disregarding his own pain, still grabbed Liu Qin tightly and knocked him to the ground, shouting for the correspondent to tie up the special agent leader Liu Qin. Comrade Feng Chenying felt dizzy in his head only after returning to the district committee. The district committee immediately sent him to the hospital for treatment, and now his wound has healed. The Ronghe County Committee of the Communist Party of China therefore issued a notice of commendation, and called on all party members in the county to learn from Comrade Feng Chenying's spirit of resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries and protecting the interests of the people.

　　支部书记冯琛瑛英勇捕捉特务分子
    山西荣河县中共程村支部书记冯琛瑛同志，英勇捕捉特务，受到中共荣河县委的表扬。不久以前，荣河县公安局发觉有一个特务组织，阴谋组织暴动。这时程村支部书记冯琛瑛同志正在县委的党员训练班学习，县委便派他连夜回村侦察这一特务组织的头子刘琴之的行动。当时刘琴之不在家。冯琛瑛便配合着公安干部四处侦察，不久，在天兴庙捉住了刘琴之。但因区政府的看守所看管不严，刘琴之偷跑了。冯琛瑛同志立即配合公安干部多方了解情况，断定刘琴之没有走远，并且会回来叫他女人一起逃跑。于是冯琛瑛和张志学、张树科、陈克智及村通讯员小王，轮流监视刘琴之家四日四夜。在第四夜的半夜时，冯琛瑛终于看见刘琴之扛着锄头从外回来。冯琛瑛同志马上藏在门后准备捉拿，不料被刘琴之发觉，用锄头向冯琛瑛同志头上砍来。冯琛瑛头部即被砍了个三角口，流出很多血。但冯琛瑛不顾自己伤痛，仍将刘琴之紧紧抓住压倒在地，喊来通讯员，将特务头子刘琴之捆住。冯琛瑛同志回到区委会后，才觉着自己头部发晕。区委会马上将他送到医院医治，现在他的伤口已好了。中共荣河县委会因此通报表扬，并号召全县党员学习冯琛瑛同志的坚决镇压反革命、保护人民利益的精神。
