Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch: According to TASS, the Secretariat of the World Peace Council held a meeting in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on the 10th and 11th. Afterwards, a statement was issued protesting the French government's unreasonable ban on the World Peace Council's activities within France, stating: Since the establishment of its institutions in Paris by the World Peace Congress in 1949, the Council has been warmly received by the French people. However, the French government is now prohibiting the activities of the Peace Council. This police measure is aimed at the movement organized on a global scale to defend peace, because currently, only this movement provides a venue for discussion and agreement between people of the East and West, supporters of various social and economic systems, and people holding diverse opinions. However, no country's police measures can prevent the World Peace Council from completing its mission; its organization and activities, as well as the development of the world peace movement, will not be weakened. The Secretariat, on behalf of the World Peace Council, protests this decision by the French authorities and calls on national peace committees, every good person, and all peace-loving organizations to jointly protest in order to have this decision rescinded. The expansion and deepening of protests will gradually lead those who still hesitate to participate in the struggle to defend peace to sympathize with and support the peace movement. In conjunction with this, it is necessary to strengthen activities in various countries to implement the resolutions of the World Peace Council, first and foremost to strengthen propaganda for the Five Great Powers to conclude a peace pact. The response of people in various countries to this movement proves that the people of the world desire peace, and they are increasingly aware that the movement to demand that the Five Great Powers conclude a peace pact is the most effective contribution to the cause of peace that can be made through joint efforts.

　　世界和平理事会秘书处发表声明
    抗议法政府破坏和平运动
    号召各国和平委员会和人民一致抗议
    并加强宣传要求五大国缔结和平公约
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社讯：世界和平理事会秘书处于十日及十一日在捷克斯洛伐克首都布拉格举行会议，会后发表声明，抗议法国政府无理禁止世界和平理事会在法国境内活动称：自一九四九年世界和平大会在巴黎建立机构以来，即受到法国人民的热诚款待。但法国政府现在却禁止和平理事会的活动。这种警察措施是为了对付在世界范围内组织起来保卫和平的运动的，因为目前只有这个运动是东西方各国人民之间、各种社会与经济制度的拥护者之间、持有各种见解的人民之间进行讨论和取得协议的场所。但是，任何国家的警察措施都阻止不了世界和平理事会完成它的任务，它的组织与活动以及世界和平运动的发展决不会削弱。秘书处代表世界和平理事会对法国当局这一决定表示抗议，并号召各国和平委员会、每一个善良的人民及一切爱好和平的团体共同提出抗议，以使该项决定得以撤消。抗议的扩大与深入，将使那些至今仍对参加保卫和平斗争犹疑不定的人们逐渐同情和支持和平运动。与此相结合的，是要加强在各国进行活动以实现世界和平理事会的决议，首先是加强宣传五大国缔结和平公约。各国人民对这个运动的反应证明了世界人民愿望和平，他们已日益清楚地认识到，要求五大国缔结和平公约的运动，是经过共同努力所能作出的对和平事业的最有效的贡献。
