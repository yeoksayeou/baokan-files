Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Washington dispatch: After dismissing MacArthur on the 11th, U.S. President Truman delivered a national radio address that evening, declaring that America's Far East policy would not be altered as a result and that the United States would continue its war of aggression against Korea, remaining enemies with the Korean and Chinese people to the end.

　　Truman admitted that the war of aggression against Korea "is a difficult and arduous task." He expressed fear of the powerful strength of the Korean and Chinese people resisting aggression. However, after completely blaming MacArthur for the difficulties caused by the failure of the war of aggression against Korea, Truman emphatically announced that the United States must carry the war of aggression against Korea through to the end. He said: "This is the most effective course of action we can pursue," Truman openly declared in his speech: "The change of commander in the Far East does not mean any change in American policy. We will continue the Korean War with perseverance and determination to bring the war to a swift and victorious end."

　　However, Truman had to admit that the American war of aggression against Korea had caused his government to lose the support of the people. He said at the beginning that even many people who had previously supported the policy of aggression against Korea were now questioning American policy. Therefore, Truman devoted a great deal of his speech to defending his policy of aggression. He repeated old tunes, even resorting to creating rumors to wantonly slander the Soviet Union, China, and the Korean people as "aggressors," while portraying his own acts of aggression as being for "stopping aggression" and preventing "World War III." He deceitfully proclaimed that his government was "always willing to hold negotiations to restore peace in Korea." But he immediately added: "We (referring to the American aggressors) must conduct military operations to ensure the safety of our troops." Defeating the Korean and Chinese people "may become a turning point in the world's search for viable solutions to achieve peace and security." Finally, he clamored in an extremely rogue tone that if World War III were to break out, the United States and its allies would bear "no responsibility."

　　Truman's speech clearly exposed that the American imperialists have not learned enough lessons from the failure of the war of aggression against Korea, and they will recklessly persist in aggression to the end, regardless of the opposition of the American and world people. This insane determination was reiterated by Truman at a Democratic Party meeting in Washington on the 14th. This time, he even more presumptuously described the American aggression against Korea and China as being for "fighting to restore international rule of law and order." That is to say, the Truman government is prepared to continue the war of aggression in order to force Korea and China to accept the Syngman Rhee-style and Chiang Kai-shek-style "rule of law and order."

### 杜鲁门叫嚣继续侵略朝鲜、中国

　　杜鲁门叫嚣继续侵略朝鲜、中国
    【新华社十九日讯】华盛顿消息：美国总统杜鲁门在十一日把麦克阿瑟撤职之后，当天晚间，即向全国发表广播演说，宣布美国的远东政策决不因此而有所更改，美国将继续进行侵朝战争，与中朝人民为敌到底。
    杜鲁门承认：侵朝战争“是一个困难的、艰苦的任务”。他对中朝人民反抗侵略的强大力量表示恐惧。但是，杜鲁门在把这种由于侵朝战争的失败而造成的困难，完全归咎于麦克阿瑟之后，却强调宣布美国必须把侵朝战争进行到底。他说：“这是我们所能奉行的最有效的行动方针”，杜鲁门在其演说中公开宣布：“远东统帅的更动，并不意味着美国政策有任何改变。我们将继续以毅力和决心进行朝鲜战争，以使战争迅速达到胜利的结束。”
    但是，杜鲁门又不得不承认：美国的侵朝战争已使他的政府失尽人心。他在开头就说：甚至许多过去曾经支持过侵朝政策的人们，现在也对美国的政策怀疑起来了。因此，杜鲁门就以其演说的极大篇幅来为他的侵略政策辩护。他重弹老调，甚至不惜造作谣言肆意侮蔑苏联、中国与朝鲜人民为“侵略者”，而把自己的侵略行动说成是为了“制止侵略”，是为了防止“第三次世界大战”。他欺诈地扬言，他的政府“随时都愿意为恢复朝鲜和平而举行谈判”。但是他马上又说：“我们（指美国侵略者）必须进行军事行动，以保证我们部队的安全。”打败中朝人民“可能成为全世界在寻求取得和平与安全的可行办法中的转折点”。最后，他以极度无赖的口吻叫嚣：如果第三次世界大战要爆发的话，美国和美国的盟邦都“没有责任”。
    杜鲁门的演说清楚地暴露了美国帝国主义者并没有从侵朝战争的失败中取得足够的教训，它将不顾美国与全世界人民的反对，冒死侵略到底。这种疯狂的决心，杜鲁门十四日在华盛顿民主党的一个会议上又曾予以重申，这一次，他甚至更狂妄地把美国对朝鲜和中国的侵略说成是为了“恢复国际的法治与秩序而战”。这就是说：杜鲁门政府准备继续侵略战争以便强迫朝鲜与中国接受李承晚式的和蒋介石式的“法治与秩序”。
