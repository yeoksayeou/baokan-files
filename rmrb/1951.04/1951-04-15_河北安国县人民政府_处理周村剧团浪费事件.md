    People's Government of Anguo County, Hebei Province
    Handles Wasteful Incident of Zhoucun Theater Troupe

    After seeing the criticism of the extravagance and waste of our county's Second District Zhoucun Theater Troupe published in your newspaper's "Letters from Readers" on January 31, we have conducted a profound self-examination. This incident proves that we have not paid enough attention to the leadership of literary and artistic work ideologically, and as a result, our work has not been thorough, and we have made bureaucratic mistakes. Our county's Bureau of Culture and Education has sent a special person to the village to conduct a thorough investigation, convened a meeting of village cadres, and studied how to deal with the situation. All the cadres in Zhoucun sincerely accepted the criticism, examined the mistake of not taking care of the difficulties of the masses, and decided to sell the helmets, costumes, swords, whips, etc. (worth about 1,200 catties of wheat), and return them all to the farmers to invest in the cooperative and engage in mass production.

### 河北安国县人民政府  处理周村剧团浪费事件

　　河北安国县人民政府
    处理周村剧团浪费事件
    一月三十一日贵报《读者来信》刊载的对我县二区周村剧团铺张浪费的批评，我们看到后已作了深刻检讨。从这件事，证明了我们没有从思想上重视对文艺工作的领导，因而工作不深入，犯了官僚主义的错误。我县文教科已派专人到该村进行切实调查，召开了村干部会议，研究处理办法。周村全体干部都诚恳接受批评，检讨了没有照顾群众困难的错误，并决定将盔甲、行头、刀鞭等变卖（约值麦一、二○○斤），悉数交还农民，投入合作社，搞群众生产。
