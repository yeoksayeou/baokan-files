From the report "Investigation of the Reading Situation of 'Little People's Books' in Beishi and Shenhe Districts of Shenyang City" published in this issue, we can see three problems: First, among the more than 360 kinds of popular "Little People's Books," those with progressive content account for less than 20%, while those with backward or even reactionary content account for more than 80%. This is a serious phenomenon. Second, one of the reasons for this serious phenomenon is that there are some shortcomings in the compilation and drawing of new "Little People's Books" (such as too few pictures, monotonous images, narrow subject matter, too much explanation, and difficult text), which make these "Little People's Books" "not as popular as the old Little People's Books," so the old, harmful "Little People's Books" can still occupy a strong position. Third, this drives some publishers of old "Little People's Books" to engage in the publication of backward and reactionary reading materials for the sole purpose of making profits, thereby spreading extremely harmful influences.

We should have close concern for the education of contemporary children. Moreover, because the readers of these "Little People's Books" also include some adults, we cannot but pay more attention to them. Furthermore, the phenomenon reflected in this report is by no means limited to Shenyang; this phenomenon exists to varying degrees in large and small cities across the country.

Therefore, we put forward the following suggestions to the cultural and educational departments of governments at all levels, the compilers, artists, and publishers of "Little People's Books," and the publishing management organs:

One, Helping the transformation and progress of old "Little People's Book" stalls is a work that cultural and educational workers in various places should widely undertake. It should be done step by step and in a planned manner. When carrying out this work, the method of the Taiyuan City Cultural Center to transform and help old "Little People's Book" stalls published in the ninth issue of this journal can be adopted appropriately in combination with the actual local situation. Xinhua Bookstores in various places should also vigorously promote excellent reading materials at the same time.

Two, The compilers and artists of new comic strips should clearly define the division of labor between the two types of reading materials, those for children and those for workers, peasants and adults. In making real "Little People's Books" for children, they should appropriately take into account children's understanding, study and grasp children's interests and children's language, and make them more popular and more image-based. All compilers and artists of new comic strips must, on the one hand, wage a serious struggle against the tendency of thoughtlessness and indifference to politics, and on the other hand, must also improve the artistry of their works and strengthen their storytelling. Strong storytelling and the prominence of characters are common characteristics of all Chinese folk art. We must critically absorb this advantage in order to produce books that are easily accepted and welcomed by readers, and completely drive out harmful old comic strips through competition.

Three, Persuasive work should be carried out on the publishers of old comic strips to make them stop publishing harmful reading materials. The Shanghai Municipal Publishing Administration and the joint organization of the comic strip publishing industry should provide practical and effective assistance to those publishers mentioned in this report and in the article by Comrade Liu Deyuan in the "Literary Gazette," and urge them to change their policies; all literary and art workers must attach importance to this widely influential literary and artistic tool, and work harder in this area so that publishers will not feel difficult in obtaining new manuscripts, and therefore can publish new comic strips in large quantities. This can be done. Taking old opera scripts as an example, the Baowentang Bookstore in Beijing published more than 600 kinds after liberation, all of which were outdated. However, since Baowentang obtained the cooperation of new lyric writers, the number of old opera scripts has been reduced to more than 100 last year due to the new replacements, and is still decreasing.

At the same time, it should be made clear that we have the responsibility to ask publishers to conduct earnest self-examination of publications such as the "Scientific Atomic Library" revealed in the report that clearly promote reactionary ideas and violate the Common Program, and to stop these books from being sold on the market.

### 注意《小人书》的编绘、出版

　　注意《小人书》的编绘、出版
    从本期发表的“沈阳市北市区和沈河区《小人书》阅读情况的调查”的报道中，我们可以看出三个问题：一、在比较流行的三百六十多种的《小人书》中，内容进步的还不到百分之二十，而内容落后甚至反动的竟占了百分之八十强，这是一个严重的现象；二、造成这一严重现象的原因之一，是新的《小人书》编绘上存在某一些缺点（如画图太少，画面单调，题材狭窄，说明太多而且文字艰深等），以致使这些小人书“不如旧小人书那么受人欢迎”，因而旧的有害的《小人书》还能占有很强的阵地；三、这就驱使某些旧《小人书》的出版者为了单纯牟利，还在从事于落后反动的读物的出版，从而散布着极端有害的影响。
    我们对于当代儿童的教育应该有密切的关怀。更因为这些《小人书》的读者还包括了一些成年人，尤其不能不加以更多的注意。而且这一报道所反映的现象，绝不只是沈阳一地的问题，在全国大大小小的城市中这现象是或多或少都存在着的。
    为此，我们向全国各地政府文教部门、《小人书》的编绘者、出版者和出版管理机关提出如下的建议：
    一、帮助旧《小人书》摊的改造和进步是各地文教工作者应该广泛着手的一项工作。应该有步骤、有计划地去做好。在进行这项工作时，本刊第九号所发表的太原市文化馆改造、帮助旧《小人书》摊的方法，是可以结合当地实际情况酌量采用的。各地新华书店对优良读物的推广，也应该同时大力进行。
    二、新的连环画的编绘者应明确以儿童为对象及以工农和成年人为对象的两种读物的分工，在制作供儿童读的真正的《小人书》中，应该适当地照顾儿童的了解力，研究、掌握儿童兴趣和儿童语言，更加通俗化，更加形象化。一切新连环画的编绘者，都必须一方面要和无思想性和漠视政治的倾向进行严正的斗争，一方面也须要提高作品的艺术性，加强其故事性。故事性强和人物性格的突出化是中国一切民间文艺的共同特点，我们必须批判地吸收这一优点，才能制作出容易为读者所接受而且欢迎的书籍，用竞赛方式把有害的旧连环画彻底驱逐出去。
    三、对旧连环画的出版者，应该进行有力的说服工作，使他们停止有害读物的出版。上海市出版管理机关和连环画出版业的联合组织应该对这一报道中以及《文艺报》刘德元同志文章中所提到的那些出版家，予以切实有效的帮助，督促他们改变方针；一切文艺、美术工作者必须重视这一影响广大的文艺工具，更努力地进行这一方面的工作，以便使出版者在新的稿源上不感到困难，因而能大量出版新的连环画。这是可以做到的。以旧唱本为例，北京宝文堂书店在解放后还出了六百多种，这些旧唱本都是内容陈腐的。但宝文堂自从取得新唱词作家的合作后，由于有了新的代替，旧唱本在去年已减少到一百多种，目前还在递减中。
    同时，应该说明，像报道中所揭露的《科学原子库》之类明显地宣传反动思想、违反共同纲领的出版物，我们有责任要求出版者切实自我检讨，并制止这些书在市场上销行。
