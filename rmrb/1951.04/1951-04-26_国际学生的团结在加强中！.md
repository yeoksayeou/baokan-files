　　International Student Solidarity is Strengthening!
    Since its establishment, the International Union of Students (IUS) has, in accordance with the demands and aspirations of democratic students worldwide, defined its goals and tasks as: to promote friendship among students worldwide and to provide all means to strengthen cooperation between student groups from all countries, in order to safeguard the common rights and interests of students, improve student welfare and education; to prepare themselves to assume the tasks of a democratic citizen: to build a better, free, progressive, and peaceful world.
    All the work and activities of the IUS represent the interests and demands of students worldwide, and therefore, it has gained the love and support of the vast majority of students. Currently, over five million students from seventy-one countries around the world are united around the IUS. Although their skin color, language, politics, and religious beliefs are different, they all actively respond to the call of the IUS, participate in the movements it launches, support the IUS Charter, and resolutely realize the slogans put forward by the IUS. They deeply understand that the sincere unity of students worldwide is a powerful weapon for striving for peace and safeguarding the welfare of student life.
    Precisely because of the efforts made by the IUS in uniting democratic students worldwide in the cause of defending peace, imperialist elements spare no effort to undermine the prestige of the IUS, instructing the reactionary leaders of student unions in countries such as Britain and the United States to carry out various activities to sabotage and split the international student movement, and continuously slander and smear the IUS through newspapers and magazines that serve as mouthpieces for imperialism.
    The reactionary leaders of the British and American student unions have long engaged in divisive activities within the IUS organization, attempting to obstruct the unity of international students. They stirred up struggles in every meeting of the IUS decision-making bodies (such as the Council and the Executive Committee), nitpicking and criticizing the activities and policies of the IUS. Such activities were supported by the reactionary leaders of student unions in France, Denmark, Belgium, and other countries. However, progressive forces are dominant in the IUS decision-making bodies, and the reactionary leaders of the British and American student unions have repeatedly suffered defeats in both the debates and the voting on resolutions, thus ensuring that the IUS can formulate and implement policies and decisions that conform to the vital interests of students worldwide.
    In 1948, the "February events" occurred in Czechoslovakia. American imperialism instructed reactionary elements within Czechoslovakia to conspire to carry out treasonous rebellions, which were suppressed by the united actions of the Czech people. During the events, some fascist students in Czechoslovakia fled the country to escape punishment after being reported by their classmates. The reactionary leaders of the American student union then falsely claimed that Czech students were being persecuted by the government, criticized the IUS for standing idly by, and unreasonably withdrew from the IUS. Subsequently, in 1948 and 1949, the student unions of Denmark, Australia, France, and others also unreasonably withdrew from the IUS, attempting to use this to undermine the prestige of the IUS and weaken its organization. However, the consequences of these actions were contrary to the expectations of the reactionary leaders of student unions in the United States, France, and other countries. The IUS was not weakened as a result, but instead strengthened its organization; progressive student groups in the United States and Australia also successively joined the IUS. The IUS also strengthened its work in Latin America, Africa, and some capitalist countries in Europe, and won many new member groups.
    The reactionary elements in the international student movement, whether they have already withdrawn or are still within the IUS, continue to sow discord, spread rumors and slanders, distort the IUS Charter, carry out anti-communist and anti-Soviet propaganda, and refuse to respond to the calls of the IUS, attempting to isolate the broad student masses of Western European countries from the international student movement, leading them down the path of dropping out of school, unemployment, poverty, and war. They do not allow the IUS propaganda materials to circulate among students, attempting to conceal the truth about the IUS in order to deceive students.
    In recent years, the reactionary leaders of the British student union have intensified their activities to split the unity of international students. However, a series of divisive conspiracies and activities have not harmed the cause of international student unity in the slightest. Under the righteous exposure and protests of democratic students in various countries, the splitters of the international student movement have attempted to establish an international student organization to confront the IUS, but have consistently failed to achieve their goals, and their conspiracies have all ended in failure.
    Despite the fact that a very small number of reactionary elements instructed by imperialism are doing their utmost to carry out sabotage activities, the great unity of international students is becoming increasingly close and expanding with the consolidation and development of the IUS. Various student gatherings and activities jointly organized by the IUS and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, such as "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism" (February 21), "Day of Support for the Struggle of Spanish Youth" (April 14) and the commemorative activities of International Student Week, are enthusiastically participated in by students from all over the world every year, becoming a tradition of the international student movement. The World Youth and Student Festival held in Budapest in 1949 was attended by more than 10,000 youth and student representatives from 82 countries, one-third of whom were students, demonstrating the strong will and strength of international student solidarity and cooperation.
    The Second World Student Congress held in Prague in August 1950 demonstrated the further great unity of students worldwide in the struggle for peace and the defense of their vital interests. The conference reviewed the work of the IUS since its establishment and determined the tasks of the IUS in the struggle for peace, national independence, and democratic education. Student representatives from various countries expressed their support for the IUS and their determination to unite international students to defend peace in various languages. Only a very small number of reactionary representatives, led by the reactionary leaders of the British student union, attacked the IUS and slandered the Soviet Union. Jenkins, the reactionary leader of the British student union, proposed that the IUS should not engage in political activities and criticized the IUS for not paying attention to the opinions of a minority of people. Jenkins' shameless remarks were rejected and refuted by representatives from various countries. The refutation of the representatives of various countries exposed the true face of the splitters of the international student movement in front of the student representatives of the whole world, and promoted the smooth progress of the conference.
    The Congress overwhelmingly passed important documents such as the main resolution, the Message to the Students of the World, and the Resolution on Supporting Korean Students. These documents called on students around the world to strengthen unity, defend peace, and stop imperialist aggression. This more closely combined the international democratic student movement with the cause of safeguarding peace of the people of the world, and pushed the cause of international student unity forward by a big step; at the same time, during the Congress, the number of members of the IUS increased sharply to more than five million. Therefore, the Second World Student Congress is a sign of the growth of unity among students from all countries, and will occupy a very important place in the annals of the international democratic student movement.
    Since the closing of the Student Congress, the IUS has faithfully implemented the resolutions of the Congress, actively cooperated with the world peace movement, and mobilized students from various countries to strive for the realization of the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress and the First World Peace Council. The IUS called on students around the world to oppose the rearmament of West Germany and Japan by American imperialism, and at the same time responded to the signature campaign launched for the declaration demanding the signing of a peace treaty by the five major powers. During the same period, the IUS also vigorously promoted cultural exchanges and sports activities among students worldwide; in particular, the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival, jointly organized with the World Federation of Youth, was of great significance. These facts all show that on the basis of the resolutions of the Second World Student Congress, the great democratic unity of international students is growing day by day and becoming more and more consolidated.

### 国际学生的团结在加强中！

　　国际学生的团结在加强中！
    国际学生联合会自成立以来，即根据全世界民主学生的要求和愿望，规定了它的目标和任务，即是：要促进全世界学生之间的友谊，并提供一切方法加强各国学生团体间的合作，以维护学生的共同权利和利益，改善学生的福利和教育；要他们自己准备担负一个民主公民应有的任务：建立一个美好、自由、进步、和平的世界。
    国际学联的一切工作与活动都代表着世界学生的利益和要求，因此，它获得了广大学生的爱戴和拥护。现在，全世界已有七十一国的五百多万学生团结在国际学联的周围。虽然他们的肤色、语言、政治、和宗教信仰各不相同，但都积极响应国际学联的号召，参加它所发动的运动，拥护国际学联的会章，并坚决实现国际学联所提出的口号。他们深深了解：全世界学生的精诚团结就是争取和平与维护学生生活福利的一个有力武器。
    正因为国际学联在团结全世界民主学生保卫和平的事业上所作的努力，帝国主义分子不惜千方百计地破坏国际学联的威信，指使了英、美等国学联的反动领袖进行破坏和分裂国际学运的种种活动，并通过作为帝国主义传声筒的报章杂志，不断地对国际学联加以诽谤和诬蔑。
    英、美学联的反动领袖们曾经长期地在国际学联组织以内进行分裂活动，企图阻挠国际学生的团结。他们在国际学联决策机构的每一次会议中（如理事会和执委会）都挑起斗争，吹毛求疵地指责国际学联的活动与政策。他们这样的活动得到了法国、丹麦、比利时等国学联反动领袖的支持。但是在国际学联的决策机构中，进步势力是占优势的，无论在会议的辩论中或决议的表决中，英、美学联的反动领袖都接连地遭到失败，这样就保证了国际学联能够制订并且执行符合于全世界学生切身利益的政策和决定。
    一九四八年，捷克发生“二月事变”。美帝国主义指使捷克国内反动分子阴谋进行卖国叛乱，结果为捷克人民的团结行动镇压下去。事变时期中，捷克的一部分法西斯学生在同学检举之下畏罪逃亡国外，反动的美国学联领袖即妄称捷克学生受到政府的迫害，指责国际学联坐视不理，同时并无理地退出了国际学联。此后在一九四八和一九四九两年间，丹麦、澳大利亚、法国等学联亦无理退出国际学联，企图借此打击国际学联的威信，削弱其组织。但是这些行动的后果是出乎美、法等国学联反动领袖的意料的，国际学联并未因此而削弱，却相反地加强了自己的组织；美国、澳大利亚的进步学生团体也相继加入国际学联。国际学联并在拉丁美洲、非洲以及欧洲的若干资本主义国家中，加强了工作，赢得了许多新的会员团体。
    国际学运的反动分子，不论是已经退出或仍留在国际学联以内的，都继续挑拨离间，造谣污蔑，歪曲国际学联的会章，进行反共反苏宣传，拒绝响应国际学联的号召，企图把西欧各国广大学生群众从国际学生运动孤立起来，使之走向失学、失业、贫困、战争的道路上去。他们不让国际学联的宣传品在学生中流传，企图借此隐蔽国际学联的真相，以达到欺骗学生的目的。
    近年以来，英国学联的反动领袖们更变本加厉地进行分裂国际学生团结的活动。但是一连串的分裂阴谋与活动并未丝毫损害国际学生的团结事业；在各国民主学生正义的揭露与抗议下，国际学运的分裂者们妄图成立与国际学联对抗的国际学生组织，但是一直未能达到目的，他们的阴谋活动也一一归于失败。
    尽管那极少数为帝国主义指使的反动分子，极力进行破坏活动，但是国际学生的大团结却随着国际学联的巩固发展而日益紧密与扩大。国际学联与世界民主青年联盟所共同组织的各种学生集会、活动，如“反对殖民制度斗争日”（二月二十一日），“支援西班牙青年斗争日”（四月十四日）和国际学生周的纪念活动等，每年都有全世界各地的学生踊跃参加，成为国际学生运动的传统。一九四九年在布达佩斯举行的世界青年学生联欢节，有来自八十二个国家一万以上的青年学生代表参加，其中三分之一是学生，显示了国际学生团结合作的坚强意愿与力量。
    一九五○年八月在布拉格召开的世界学生第二次代表大会，表现了世界学生在争取和平以及保卫切身利益的斗争中，进一步的大团结。大会检讨了国际学联自成立以来的工作，以及确定国际学联在为争取和平、民族独立与民主教育而斗争的任务。来自各个国家的学生代表，都以各种不同的语言，表示他们拥护国际学联，拥护国际学生为保卫和平而团结起来的决心。会上只有以英国学联反动领袖为首的极少数反动代表，攻击国际学联与污蔑苏联。英国学联反动领袖詹金斯提出国际学联不应进行政治活动，并指责国际学联不注重少数人的意见。詹金斯的无耻谰言遭到各国代表的唾弃和驳斥。各国代表的驳斥在全世界学生代表面前，暴露了国际学运分裂者的真面目，并促使大会顺利地进行。
    代表大会以压倒的多数，胜利地通过了主要决议、告世界学生书、支援朝鲜学生的决议等重要文件。这些文件号召世界学生加强团结，保卫和平，制止帝国主义的侵略。这样就把国际民主学生运动和全世界人民维护和平的事业更紧密地结合起来了，把国际学生的团结事业向前推进了一大步；同时在大会时期中，国际学联的会员数目又激增至五百余万。因此世界学生第二次代表大会是各国学生团结成长的标志，在国际民主学生运动的史册中将占着很重要的地位。
    学生代表大会闭幕以来，国际学联忠实地执行大会的决议，积极配合了世界和平运动，并动员各国学生争取第二届世界保卫和平大会以及第一届世界和平理事会决议的实现。国际学联号召世界学生反对美帝国主义重新武装西德和日本，同时响应为要求五大国签订和平公约的宣言而展开的签名运动。在同一时期中，国际学联更以大力促进世界学生的文化交流和体育活动；特别是与世界青联一道共同组织的第三届世界青年学生和平联欢节，富有重大的意义。这些事实都说明了，在世界学生第二次代表大会决议的基础上，国际学生的民主大团结正在逐日成长并且愈来愈巩固了。
