　　Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting on the 12th and 13th of this month to focus on inspecting the arrangements and implementation by Party committees at all levels regarding the popularization and deepening of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and the organization of the May Day demonstration. This is an important method for promoting the in-depth movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea.
    According to reports at the meeting, since the launch of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea last October, 70 to 80 percent of the people in North China have received patriotic education. For example, in Mingyuedian West Street, Ding County, Hebei, a current affairs quiz was held, and out of the 90 participants (including Party members, Youth League members, farmers, women, and primary and secondary school students), 70 roughly understood the reasons for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. Patriotic education was less effective only in remote mountain villages and among women, the elderly, and religious groups.
    Since the China People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea issued a circular on March 14 regarding the popularization and deepening of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, leading organs in various regions have conducted typical investigations and formulated specific plans based on actual circumstances on how to continue large-scale propaganda, how to extend the movement to remote streets and villages, and how to conduct current affairs education among the elderly and women.
    After listening to reports from various regions, the meeting believed that this kind of inspection work is an important method for guiding the in-depth development of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea in the future. However, when inspecting, it is necessary to pay attention to checking the effectiveness of propaganda and the understanding of the masses regarding the significance of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea.
    According to reports at the meeting, the issue that resisting US aggression and aiding Korea is the driving force of all work and can be combined with the current central tasks has been basically resolved in various regions through practical experience. For example, Anyang County in Pingyuan Province successfully completed tasks such as paying public grain and arranging production due to the strengthening of patriotic education to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Now, based on this experience, the leading organs of the county have put forward the requirement that "the movement will not stop until US imperialism falls," making the movement a regular activity. The leading organs in Gaoping and Tunliu in the Changzhi area of Shanxi Province, because of complacency and 麻痹 in their thinking, did not earnestly carry out propaganda and education to resist US aggression and aid Korea, resulting in a passive situation after confusion arose in the thinking of the masses. Now they have learned a lesson from this and are working hard to carry out patriotic education to resist US aggression and aid Korea. However, so far, some local leading organs still do not have sufficient understanding of this, or do not earnestly promote it, or carry out the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea in parallel with tasks such as arranging spring plowing, mobilizing farmers to increase cotton production, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, causing cadres to feel that there are too many tasks and want to complete them using a crash method. The meeting emphasized that this situation must be corrected in the preparations for the May Day demonstration.
    Regarding how to implement the plan to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the meeting pointed out that the "contract system" adopted by various regions is very good, that is, assigning specific personnel to be responsible for conducting propaganda to the masses who have not yet received education on resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, street by street, lane by lane, area by area, and household by household; but it is necessary to pay attention to cherishing the time and energy of cadres and the masses. For this reason, it is necessary to have full preparation and pay attention to the actual effect of propaganda, preventing too many meetings. The meeting should not stipulate numerous programs or make lengthy speeches. All propaganda materials must be short, popular, and easy to understand. The meeting also pointed out that the May Day patriotic demonstrations in various regions must be held under the conscious and voluntary participation of the masses, strictly preventing coercion and commandism.
    The heads of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee, Tongxian Prefectural Committee, Tongxian County Committee, Tangshan Municipal Committee, Changzhi Prefectural Committee of Shanxi Province, Huailai County Committee of Chahar Province, and Anyang County Committee of Pingyuan Province participated in this inspection meeting.
    [This newspaper] On the 7th of this month, the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a propaganda conference. The heads of the propaganda sections (departments) of the provincial and municipal party committees, some propaganda ministers of the county party committees, and propaganda cadres of the first-level people's organizations in the Northeast attended the meeting. The main contents of the meeting were to check the propaganda work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea in various regions, discuss the implementation of the March 14 notification of the China People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, so that everyone in every place can receive propaganda education on resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and the propaganda work before the May Day labor festival demonstration and parade by the people in urban and rural areas.
    The meeting unanimously held that in the early stage of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, party committees at all levels had listed the publicity of current affairs and politics of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea as the primary task and led by personally with great effort. Therefore, it has played a great role in supporting the front line in Korea, consolidating national defense, guaranteeing economic construction, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, eliminating the ideological influence of imperialism, and completing various tasks. However, due to the failure of the leadership in some areas to check in time, discover problems, and earnestly sum up experience to continue to push forward the propaganda work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, the propaganda work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea has been slack, sporadic, and intermittent since the New Year. In the huge political struggle against the United States rearming Japan, except for some cities holding parades and demonstrations and individual regions conducting accusations, the broad masses of people have not been involved in this movement. For example, many workers in some factories and mines in Anshan have not heard the propaganda report about the United States rearming Japan. According to reports from Liaodong, since this spring, there has been very little current affairs and political propaganda work in most rural areas, and even the provincial reporters have not yet been determined. In some factories and urban areas in Shenyang, the preparations for the May Day demonstration and the popularization and deepening of the propaganda to resist US aggression and aid Korea have not been seriously arranged. Other provinces and cities also have many similar situations, especially the agency cadres generally failed to actively participate in the patriotic propaganda and education movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Comprehensive situation reflected in the meeting shows that some of our leaders have not fully realized that the patriotic current affairs and political propaganda of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea is the political foundation and premise of the current tasks. The current tasks are bound to be weak and powerless without the current general political movement. Some regions regard the propaganda work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea as an "extra burden" in addition to various tasks. Some party committee propaganda departments lack enthusiasm and initiative and have not concentrated all their efforts to carry out this work. Although some regions may have listed it as a plan or put it first, it is still a general call. In terms of the propaganda content of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, some regions have become general, failed to closely integrate with the current main tasks, enrich and enrich the propaganda content through various vivid examples, and failed to add new things with the situation. The existence of this situation has greatly affected the continued upsurge of the patriotic production competition; the phenomenon of some farmers' production emotions fluctuating in rural areas has not been overcome in time; and rumors still have a certain market in urban and rural areas.
    The meeting finally believed that to earnestly popularize and deepen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and to earnestly prepare for the May Day demonstration of the people in urban and rural areas, in addition to the active and proactive work of the propaganda departments and seizing the major events of each period to promote the propaganda of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, it is required that the entire party attach importance to the propaganda and education work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and regard the popularization and deepening of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea as the most important political task at the moment. Party committees at all levels should formulate detailed and feasible plans, actively complete them, assist in establishing the sub-associations of the provinces, cities, and counties to resist US aggression and aid Korea as soon as possible, and give full play to the power of reporters and propagandists. All Communist Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and advanced elements in various people's organizations should stand at the forefront of the great ranks of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea!

　　华北局和东北局宣传部分别召开会议
    检查各地抗美援朝运动
    推动“五一”大示威的准备工作
    【新华社十九日讯】中共中央华北局于本月十二、十三两日召开会议，有重点地检查各级党委关于普及深入抗美援朝运动与组织“五一”大示威计划的布置与执行情形。这是推动深入抗美援朝运动的重要方法。
    根据会上的汇报，自去年十月开展抗美援朝运动以来，华北各地已有百分之七十至八十的人受到爱国主义教育。如河北定县明月店西街曾举行时事测验，参加测验的九十人（包括党员、团员、农民、妇女、高、初小学生），即有七十个人大体了解抗美援朝的道理。只有在偏僻的山庄和妇女、老人、宗教界群众中所进行的爱国主义教育较差。
    自三月十四日中国人民抗美援朝总会发布关于普及深入抗美援朝运动的通告以来，各地领导机关曾进行了典型调查，根据实际情形，制订了如何继续进行大规模宣传、如何把运动推广到偏僻街巷村庄、如何在老年人和妇女群众中进行时事教育的具体计划。
    会议在听取各地的报告后，认为这种检查工作是今后指导各地深入开展抗美援朝运动的一个重要方法。但在检查时必须注意着重检查宣传效果，检查群众对抗美援朝意义的了解。
    根据会上的汇报，对于抗美援朝是一切工作的动力，并且能够与当前各项中心工作结合进行的这一个问题，各地已从实际体验中基本上得到了解决。如平原省安阳县即因加强了抗美援朝爱国教育，而顺利地完成了缴纳公粮和布置生产等项任务。现在该县领导机关根据这一体验，提出“美帝国主义不倒，运动不停”的要求，使运动走入经常化。山西省长治地区的高平、屯留等地领导机关，因为在思想上自满、麻痹，没有认真地进行抗美援朝宣传教育工作，结果在群众思想发生混乱后处于被动。现在他们已从此取得教训，正努力进行抗美援朝爱国教育。但是到目前为止，还有个别地区的领导机关对此仍认识不足，或者不认真推行，或者把抗美援朝运动与布置春耕、动员农民增产棉花、镇压反革命分子等项工作并列起来进行，致使干部感到任务太多，而想用突击方法来完成。会议强调指出：这种情况必须在“五一”大示威的准备工作中纠正过来。
    关于如何实现抗美援朝计划问题，会议指出：各地“采取包干制”的办法很好，即由专人负责，对尚未受到抗美援朝教育的群众逐街、逐巷、逐片（一片地区）、逐户地进行宣传；但必须注意珍贵干部和群众的时间与精力，为此，就必须有充分准备，必须讲求宣传的实际效果，防止过多地举行会议。会议中不要规定繁多的节目，不要做冗长的演说。一切宣传品必须简短、通俗易懂。会议并指出：各地的“五一”爱国大示威，必须在群众自觉自愿的情况下举行，严格防止强迫命令。
    参加此次检查会议的有中共河北省委、通县地委、通县县委、唐山市委、山西省长治地委、察哈尔省怀来县委、平原省安阳县委等的负责人。
    【本报讯】本月七日，中共中央东北局宣传部召开宣传会议，到会有各省、市委宣传处（科）长、部分县委宣传部长、和东北一级人民团体的宣传工作干部。会议内容主要为检查各地抗美援朝宣传工作情况，讨论执行中国人民抗美援朝总会三月十四日通告，使每一处每一人都受到抗美援朝宣传教育，与迎接城乡人民“五一”劳动节大示威游行前的宣传工作问题。
    会议一致认为抗美援朝运动初期，各级党委曾把抗美援朝时事政治宣传列为首要工作，并以大力亲自领导，因而对当时支援朝鲜前线工作，巩固国防，保证经济建设，巩固人民民主专政，扫除帝国主义思想影响，与完成各项工作，都起了伟大的推动作用。但由于某些地区领导上未能及时检查，发现问题，认真总结经验，把抗美援朝的宣传工作继续推向前进，因而自新年以来，抗美援朝的宣传工作，就表现松懈、零星、时断时续。在反对美国重新武装日本这一巨大政治斗争中，除了一些城市举行游行示威，与个别地区进行控诉外，广大人民群众都未卷进这一运动中来。如鞍山市有的厂矿工人，很多没听到美国重新武装日本的宣传报告。据辽东反映，今春以来大部农村已很少有什么时事政治宣传工作了，连省级报告员至今仍未确定。沈阳某些工厂和城区，对迎接“五一”大示威与普及深入抗美援朝宣传，还未认真布置。其他省、市，也有许多类似情况，特别是机关干部则普遍未能积极主动参加抗美援朝宣传教育运动。综合会议上反映的情况，说明我们有些领导上，仍未充分认识抗美援朝爱国主义时事政治宣传，是当前各项工作的政治基础与前提，当前各项工作离开了当前总的政治运动势必软弱无力。有些地区把抗美援朝宣传工作当作各种工作之外的“额外负担”，有些党委宣传部门缺乏积极性与主动性，没有集中全力来进行这一工作。有的地区虽或列为计划，或放在首位，但仍属一般号召。在抗美援朝的宣传内容上，有些地区流于一般化，未能紧密结合当前主要工作，通过各种生动事例充实与丰富宣传内容，未能随着形势而增添新的东西。这种情况的存在，就大大影响爱国主义生产竞赛的继续高涨；农村某些农民生产情绪的波动不托的现象，也就未能及时加以克服；在城乡，谣言还有一定的市场。
    会议最后认为要认真普及深入抗美援朝运动，并切实准备城乡人民“五一”大示威，除各宣传部门积极主动进行工作，抓住各时期的重大事例，推动抗美援朝宣传外，要求全党重视抗美援朝宣传教育工作，把普及深入抗美援朝运动作为当前头等重大政治任务，各级党委应订出详细可行的计划，积极完成，尽早地协助成立各省、市、县抗美援朝分会，并充分发挥报告员、宣传员的力量。全体共产党员、青年团员和各人民团体中的先进分子应站在抗美援朝运动伟大行列的最前面！
