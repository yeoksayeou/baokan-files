　　Readers Write to This Newspaper One After Another
    Condemning the Crime of Imperialist Elements in Brutally Murdering Our Country's Children
    After this newspaper exposed the crimes of the Guangzhou "Holy Infant Baby Home" and the Nanjing "Sacred Heart Children's Home" in brutally murdering our country's children, we continuously received one hundred and twelve protest letters from all over the country, with the names of 402 people and 36 organizations.
    All letter writers expressed great anger at this inhuman crime of imperialism. The Nie Yinchang Group of the Beijing Telephone Bureau wrote: "We, the people of the whole country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, work hard with blood and sweat to strive for our bright future and for the happiness of our second generation. However, the imperialist elements still brutally murder our country's children. This is something we can never tolerate." Ding Daozhong, a Catholic student at Fu Jen Catholic University, said: "I am a Catholic. I resolutely oppose the crime of imperialism using the name of religion and charity to massacre Chinese children." All the students of the Electrical Engineering Department of the North China University of Technology and Liu Bingxin, Dong Fengjiu and others from the Weifang Municipal Third Primary School in Shandong wrote: "We hope to use various methods to publicize these facts to the people of the whole country so that all Chinese people can recognize the crimes of imperialism." Yang Yunting, a teacher at Yinjia Village Primary School in Shuangyang County, Jilin Province, wrote: "I will use these facts to educate the children and make them deeply remember that imperialism is our deadly enemy." Peking University Hospital and Peking University School of Medicine, Yenching University's Home Economics, Nursing and Preventive Medicine, Education, and Social (Child Welfare) departments held seminars, and many students criticized their past erroneous views on imperialist "charitable" undertakings. People's organizations in Shanhaiguan City held a protest forum on March 16th; on March 18th, they held a demonstration and march of 4,800 people protesting the crimes of imperialism in using "charitable" undertakings to brutally murder Chinese children. One hundred and twenty-seven medical workers from Peking University School of Medicine and Peking University Hospital submitted to this newspaper "willing to assist the government in conducting this inspection work."
