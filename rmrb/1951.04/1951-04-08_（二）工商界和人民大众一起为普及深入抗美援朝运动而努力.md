　　(II) Industrial and Commercial Circles and the People Work Together to Popularize and Deepen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement
    The patriotic Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement in industrial and commercial circles has already achieved great results. From the end of November last year to the end of March this year, more than 1.1 million industrialists and businessmen in more than 100 cities and towns across the country have held patriotic rallies and demonstrations, and signed patriotic pacts at the rallies. In many places, industrial and commercial circles actively and enthusiastically pay taxes and assist the government in stabilizing market prices. The participation of industrial and commercial circles in this great patriotic action is of great significance. Chairman Mao said in his telegram to the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles on December 2nd last year: "All patriotic industrialists and businessmen in China, together with the people, form a united front against imperialist aggression that is more consolidated than in the past. This foreshadows that the Chinese people will surely win the final victory in the sacred struggle against American aggression."

    However, on a national scale, the patriotic movement of industrial and commercial circles has not yet developed universally, and the patriotic awareness of industrial and commercial circles in areas where this movement has been carried out has not been universally raised or consolidated. Therefore, one of the most important tasks for patriotic activists in industrial and commercial circles at present is to unite with the people and continue to work hard to popularize and deepen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement.

    In order to popularize the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, industrial and commercial circles in various places should take the same steps as people from all walks of life, and hold small-scale gatherings of industrial and commercial circles as universally as possible in late April. At these gatherings, based on the specific situation of industrial and commercial circles, focus on accusing Japan and the United States of economic aggression, and the crimes of the Japanese and American running dogs, the Kuomintang bureaucrat-capitalists, in destroying national industry and commerce; at the same time, support the resolutions of the first meeting of the World Peace Council, hold a signature campaign to support the conclusion of a peace covenant, and hold a vote on the Japanese issue. Those who have not signed patriotic pacts should formulate patriotic pacts, and those who have already signed should check and implement them. On May Day, participate as universally as possible in the demonstrations of people from all walks of life to resist America, aid Korea, oppose the arming of Japan, and defend world peace.

    In order to make the patriotic movement of industrial and commercial circles develop universally and deeply, the federations of industry and commerce in various places should, in accordance with the provisions of the March 14th circular of the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, formulate a regular plan for the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement for this year within the recent period. Based on the specific situation of industrial and commercial circles, such a plan should establish current affairs study as a regular system, regularly invite people to report and hold seminars to study domestic and foreign current affairs and the policies of the People's Government; it should establish the inspection of the implementation of patriotic pacts as a regular system. In addition, it should be stipulated that regular Resist-America, Aid-Korea propaganda should be carried out in all factories, shops, enterprises and other places.

　　（二）工商界和人民大众一起为普及深入抗美援朝运动而努力
    工商界的抗美援朝爱国运动，已经有了很大的成绩。从去年十一月底到今年三月底为止，全国已经有一百个以上的城市和集镇的一百一十万以上工商业者举行爱国集会和示威游行，并且在集会上签订了爱国公约。许多地方的工商界，积极踊跃地缴纳税款，并且协助政府稳定市场物价。工商界参加到伟大的爱国行动中来，这是有着极大意义的。毛主席在去年十二月二日致天津工商界的电报中说：“全中国一切爱国的工商业家，和人民大众一道，结成一条比过去更加巩固的反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线，这就预示着中国人民在反对美国侵略的神圣斗争中一定要得到最后胜利。”
    但是，就全国的范围来说，工商界的爱国运动还没有普遍地发展，已经开展过这个运动的，工商界的爱国认识，还没有普遍提高，或者还没有巩固起来。因此，工商界中的爱国积极分子目前的最重要的任务之一，就是要和人民大众团结在一起，继续为普及深入抗美援朝运动而努力。
    为了普及抗美援朝运动，各地工商界应当和其他各界人民采取同一的步骤，在四月下旬尽可能普遍地举行工商界的小型集会，在这些集会上，根据工商界的具体情况，着重地控诉日、美的经济侵略罪行，和日、美走狗国民党官僚资本摧残民族工商业的罪行；同时拥护世界和平理事会首届会议的决议，举行拥护缔结和平公约的签名，举行日本问题的投票。没有订过爱国公约的，要订立爱国公约，已经订立过的，要加以检查、实践。在五一节，尽可能普遍地参加各界人民的抗美援朝、反对武装日本、保卫世界和平的示威游行。
    为了使工商界的爱国运动普遍、深入地发展，各地工商联合会应当根据抗美援朝总会三月十四日通告的规定，在最近时间内制订出本年的抗美援朝运动的经常计划。根据工商界的具体情况，在这样的计划中，应当把时事学习定为经常的制度，定期地请人报告和举行座谈会，学习国内外时事和人民政府的政策；应当把检查爱国公约的执行列为经常的制度。此外，并应当规定在所有工厂、商店、企业等场所，进行经常的抗美援朝宣传。
