　　North China Cotton-Producing Areas to Begin Planting Soon

　　Planting preparations in the North China cotton-producing areas are now ready, and planting will begin soon.

　　The cotton output of North China accounts for approximately 40% of the national cotton output. Last year, the region had a bumper cotton harvest, with cotton production approaching pre-war levels. This year, the region plans to expand the cotton planting area by 19.7% compared to last year, aiming for a 25.5% increase in ginned cotton production compared to last year. To complete this arduous task, cotton farmers in the cotton-producing areas have made early preparations for cotton planting. In Hebei Province, a nationally renowned cotton-producing area, after the bumper cotton harvest last autumn, cotton farmers in the province launched a large-scale seed selection and self-retention campaign. In addition, with the planned allocation by governments at all levels this spring and the mutual exchange of cotton seeds among the masses, the province now has enough cotton seeds for planting. The province plans to promote superior cotton varieties on 2.4 million mu of cotton fields this year, and has already prepared more than 16 million jin of Si-character cotton seeds, which can basically complete the promotion plan for superior cotton varieties. Cotton farmers are now conducting seed selection and germination tests to ensure the timely completion of planting tasks. The preparation of fertilizer in the province is also more adequate than in previous years, with an average of one to three carts of fertilizer applied per mu of cotton field this year. The fertilizer and cotton seeds required by the cotton-producing areas in the Pingyuan and Shanxi provinces have also been mostly prepared. In addition, cotton farmers in the cotton-rich areas last year have also purchased waterwheels one after another, preparing to repair and dig wells and dredge canals. For example, in Shulu County, Hebei Province, they plan to repair more than 1,200 wells. Cotton farmers in various places are also preparing a large number of scientific pesticides and machinery for the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests this year.

　　At present, governments at all levels and the Communist Party committees in the North China cotton-producing areas have listed cotton planting as one of the central tasks, and are taking various concrete measures to promote cotton planting by farmers. Hebei Province and the various counties in the Anyang Special District of Pingyuan have convened representative meetings of people from all walks of life, cotton farmer representative meetings, and labor model meetings to discuss and arrange cotton planting tasks, and to specifically solve various difficulties of cotton farmers. The Handan Special District of Hebei Province, in order to promote superior cotton varieties, organized farmers to visit and learn from good cotton-producing areas. Mancheng, Linqing and other places also held cotton planting technology training classes, and invited cotton planting experts to report on their bumper harvest experiences. The Yuncheng Special District Flower Yarn and Cloth Company of Shanxi Province has signed pre-purchase contracts for 100,000 mu of cotton fields with cotton farmers through supply and marketing cooperatives in various places, dispelling the farmers' concerns about low cotton prices.

### 华北产棉区即将开始播种

　　华北产棉区即将开始播种
    华北产棉区植棉准备工作业已就绪，即将开始播种。
    华北区的棉产量约占全国棉产量的百分之四十。去年全区棉花丰收，棉产量已接近战前水平。今年全区计划植棉面积比去年扩大百分之十九点七，要求比去年增产皮棉百分之二十五点五。为了完成这一艰巨任务，棉区农民已及早作了植棉准备工作。全国著名棉产区河北省，去年秋天棉花丰收后，该省棉农即开展了大规模地选种、自留种运动，又加各级人民政府今春有计划地调剂与群众的互换棉籽，现该省棉籽已足够播种用。全省今年计划推广的优良棉种棉田二百四十万亩，现已备妥斯字棉种一千六百余万斤，基本上可完成优良棉种的推广计划。现棉农户正进行粒选与发芽试验，保证及时完成播种任务。该省肥料的准备也较往年充足，今年每亩棉田平均可施一车到三车肥料。平原、山西植棉区所需用的肥料和棉种，亦大部备妥。此外，去年棉花丰收区的棉农还纷纷购制水车，准备修打水井，整理渠道，如河北束鹿县即计划修复水井一千二百多眼。各地棉农今年并准备了大批防治病虫害的科学药械。
    目前，华北产棉区各级人民政府及中共党委均将植棉工作列为中心任务之一，并采取各种具体措施推动农民植棉。河北省及平原安阳专区各县已分别召开各界代表会、棉农代表会议，劳动模范会议，讨论和布置植棉任务，具体解决棉农的各项困难。河北邯郸专区为推广优良棉种，组织农民到良棉区参观访问。满城、临清等地还举行植棉技术训练班，并请植棉能手报告丰收经验。山西运城专区花纱布公司已通过各地供销社与棉农订立十万亩棉田的预购合同，解除农民怕棉价低的思想顾虑。
