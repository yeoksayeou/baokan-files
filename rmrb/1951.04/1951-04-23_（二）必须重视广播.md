　　(II) We Must Pay Attention to Broadcasting
    Radio broadcasting is one of the powerful tools for mass propaganda and education. This has been fully proven in the propaganda and education work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union fully valued and focused on utilizing radio broadcasting. When the Soviet Republic was just established, Lenin broadcast "Letter to All the People" via radio and personally broadcast to the troops of the traitor Dukonin in Mogilev, calling on them to revolt. During the most intense period of the civil war, Lenin instructed the Soviet government to establish a powerful radio station in Moscow regardless of all difficulties. From 1918 to 1922, Lenin personally signed nearly ten decrees, resolutions, and special resolutions related to radio broadcasting. In May 1920, while ill, he wrote a letter to the People's Commissariat of Posts and Telegraphs, proposing to award two outstanding radio engineers with the Order of the Red Banner. Lenin emphasized the great political significance of radio broadcasting more than once. On January 26, 1921, he wrote: "The matter is of unparalleled importance. This is a newspaper without paper and without distance, because with… transmitters and radios, all of the Soviet Union will hear the newspaper read in Moscow." In May 1922, he re-emphasized: "This work is of particular significance to us because its achievements will bring many benefits in propaganda and agitation."

    The Chinese Communist Party also valued radio broadcasting. Before Japan's surrender, under the most difficult material conditions in northern Shaanxi, we finally established the Yan'an Xinhua Broadcasting Station; the first broadcast from the station was the order issued by Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on August 10 to all people's armed forces in the liberated areas. During the People's Liberation War, although the Yan'an Xinhua Broadcasting Station (renamed the Shaanxi North Xinhua Broadcasting Station after the evacuation of Yan'an) was in an extremely difficult situation, it never stopped broadcasting under the direct leadership and full support of the Party Central Committee, and it played a significant role in the propaganda work targeting the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, especially in disintegrating the Kuomintang army.

    Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, China's people's broadcasting has developed rapidly. Article 49 of the Common Program stipulates that "the people's broadcasting事业" (broadcasting undertaking) should be developed. The "Decision on Establishing a Radio Receiving Network" promulgated by the News Administration last April was the first decree related to radio broadcasting promulgated by the government in Chinese history. In the past year, from the central to the provincial and municipal levels, party committees, governments, and military leadership organs have successively issued 126 decisions, instructions, circulars, and notices for the construction of the people's broadcasting undertaking. The funding for broadcasting undertakings accounts for a large proportion of the central and local cultural and educational funding. In a short year, the radio receiving network has spread throughout 1,806 counties and banners in 28 provinces, 8 administrative regions, and 1 autonomous region across the country, with 2,155 receiving stations and 11,194 radio operators. In major cities, there are also 12,859 listening groups and more than 2,600 radio operators. In addition, about 1,000 wired broadcasting stations capable of broadcasting on their own have been set up in factories, mines, railway systems, and schools, cultural centers, etc. The widespread establishment of the radio receiving network has given the people's broadcasting undertaking a solid mass foundation and has played a significant role in propaganda and education.

    Recently, the People's Broadcasting Stations in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, Wuxi, Nanjing, Taiyuan, Jinan, and other cities have achieved remarkable results in publicizing resistance to US aggression and aid to Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, destroying reactionary secret societies, opposing US imperialism's arming of Japan, and carrying out patriotic production competitions. On March 29, Tianjin organized 500,000 people to listen to the live broadcast of the Tianjin People's Broadcasting Station on the enlarged meeting of people's representatives from all walks of life in the city and districts discussing the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the accusations of victims' families against special agents and bandits. During the short three hours of listening to the broadcast, the radio station received more than 600 letters and more than 2,000 telephone calls from the masses, as well as 27 long-distance calls from Tianjin Prefecture, Tianjin County, and Tangda and other places. At the same time, many citizens personally went to the radio station to request to make accusations. On April 15, Wuhan organized 500,000 people to listen to the broadcast of the accusation meeting held by people's representatives from all walks of life to suppress counter-revolutionaries, accounting for 40% of the city's population. The new broadcasting form of the broadcasting conference created by Chinese people's broadcasting workers and welcomed by the broad masses has audiences ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands to one or two million. Lenin once called radio broadcasting a "mass meeting of millions of people." Our people's broadcasting stations have begun to move in this direction. The National People's Broadcasting Station has also become an excellent tool for spreading news, issuing government orders, exchanging work experience, and providing legitimate entertainment. There are already more than 400 popular newspapers and periodicals published nationwide based on broadcasting content.

    Radio broadcasting can become the most sensitive and powerful guidance tool for leading organs at all levels and can produce a great propaganda and education effect in the political life of urban people. This is a very obvious fact. However, not all leading organs have recognized this fact. Currently, there are still some local leading organs that either do not understand the performance of radio broadcasting, are not good at using or rarely use this modern propaganda weapon; or do not value it, and even doubt its role. In the latter case, the local radio station will encounter many difficulties: the work does not get help, the personnel are not replenished, and the funding is often insufficient (individual radio stations have had to "borrow" funds from the financial authorities on a monthly basis). As a result, the role of local broadcasting is greatly weakened, and the propaganda work is adversely affected.

    China's people's broadcasting undertaking currently has considerable material conditions and a mass base, and it is possible to carry out large-scale propaganda and education work. Radio stations and their radio receiving networks have now become a huge propaganda apparatus. Its work has a huge impact on the broad masses of the people, especially urban residents. The leading organs at all levels should fully value and focus on utilizing this new propaganda and education tool to promote work and educate the people. The propaganda organs at all levels, especially the propaganda departments of the Party committees, should pay more attention to and strengthen the leadership of the broadcasting and radio receiving network work, regularly discuss and review the plans for broadcasting work, improve the efficiency of broadcasting work and the ideological level of program content; appropriately equip and train cadres for broadcasting work in a planned way; and develop the broadcasting and radio receiving network step by step, including the radio receiving stations in districts and townships and the wired broadcasting networks in urban factories, mines, and schools. Caring about and leading broadcasting work, developing and applying broadcasting undertakings should be one of the important daily affairs of the propaganda organs at all levels.

　　（二）必须重视广播
    无线电广播是群众性宣传教育的强有力工具之一。这在抗美援朝和镇压反革命分子的宣传教育工作中，已得到了充分的证明。
    苏联共产党是充分重视和着重利用无线电广播的。列宁在苏维埃共和国刚成立的时候，就由无线电广播了“告全体人民书”，并亲自对莫吉利沃城叛将杜鹤宁所部广播，号召他们起义。在内战最剧烈的时期，列宁指示苏俄政府不顾一切困难，在莫斯科建立了强大的广播电台。列宁在一九一八至一九二二年五年间，曾亲自签署了近十件有关无线电广播的法令、决议和特别决议。一九二○年五月，他在病中还写信给邮电人民委员会，提议授予两位杰出的无线电工程师以红旗勋章。列宁曾不止一次地强调过无线电广播的巨大的政治意义。他在一九二一年一月二十六日写道：“事情是无比重大的，这是不用纸和没有距离的报纸，因为有了……放送器和收音机，全苏联都将听到在莫斯科诵读的报纸。”他在一九二二年五月又重新强调地说：“这些工作对我们有特别重大的意义，因为它的成绩会招致宣传鼓动工作方面的许多益处。”
    中国共产党也是重视无线电广播的。在日本投降前，在陕北最困难的物质条件下，我们终于创建了延安新华广播电台；电台第一天播送的，就是中国人民解放军总部朱德总司令八月十日向所有解放区的人民军队发布的命令。在人民解放战争期间，延安新华广播电台（延安撤退后改称陕北新华广播电台）虽然处境极端困难，但在党中央的直接领导和充分支持下，从未停止播音，而且在对国民党统治区人民，特别是在瓦解国民党军的宣传工作方面，起了很大的作用。
    中央人民政府成立之后，我国人民广播事业更有了迅速发展。共同纲领第四十九条，规定应“发展人民的广播事业”。去年四月新闻总署公布的“关于建立广播收音网的决定”，是中国历史上第一个由政府公布的有关无线电广播的法令。一年来，从中央至省市各级党委政府与部队领导机关，为建设人民的广播事业，曾先后发出了一百二十六件决定、指示、通令和通告。广播事业经费占中央和地方文教经费很大的一部分。在短短一年中，广播收音网已遍及全国二十八省、八个行署、一个自治区的一千八百零六个县和盟旗，拥有二千一百五十五处收音站和一万一千一百九十四个收音员。在各大城市，又有收听小组一万二千八百五十九个和收音员二千六百多人，此外，在各工厂、矿山、铁道系统以及学校文化馆等，还设置能自行播音的有线广播台约一千座。广播收音网的普遍建立，已使人民广播事业获得了确实的群众基础，并发挥了巨大的宣传教育作用。
    最近北京、天津、沈阳、上海、武汉、重庆、无锡、南京、太原、济南等城市人民广播电台，在宣传抗美援朝、镇压反革命、摧毁反动会道门、反对美帝国主义武装日本和开展爱国主义生产竞赛等方面，都获得了显著的成绩。天津在三月二十九日组织了五十万人收听该市人民广播电台关于市、区各界人民代表扩大会议讨论镇压反革命和受害人家属控诉特务匪徒罪行的广播实况。在收听广播的短短三小时中，广播电台即收到群众来信六百余封，电话两千多次，并接到来自天津专署、天津县与塘大等地的长途电话二十七次。同时有许多市民亲自到电台来要求控诉。武汉四月十五日组织了五十万人收听关于各界人民代表举行的镇压反革命控诉大会的广播，占全市人口百分之四十。中国人民广播工作者所创造的并为广大群众所欢迎的广播大会这样新的广播形式，其听众少则数万十数万，多则由数十万至一二百万。列宁曾经把无线电广播称为“千百万人的群众大会”，我们的人民广播电台，已开始走上了这个方向。全国人民广播电台在传布新闻，下达政令，交流工作经验和提供正当的娱乐方面，也已成为一个很出色的工具。全国以广播内容为基础而出版的通俗报刊，已有四百多种。
    无线电广播可以成为各级领导机关最灵敏有力的指导工具，可以在城市人民政治生活中产生极大的宣传教育作用，这已是非常明显的事实。但是，并不是所有的领导机关都已认识了这一事实。现在我们还有一些地方领导机关，或者是还不大懂得无线电广播的性能，还不善于利用或是很少利用这个现代化的宣传武器；或者是不重视它，甚至对它的作用发生怀疑。在后一种情形下，当地的广播电台就会遇到许多困难：工作得不到帮助，人员得不到补充，经费也往往不足（个别广播台曾不得不逐月向财政机关“借款”）。其结果，地方广播的作用大大减弱，宣传工作就受了很不利的影响。
    我国的人民广播事业目前已具备了相当的物质条件和群众基础，已有可能去执行巨大规模的宣传教育工作。广播电台及其收音网，现在已成为一个庞大的宣传机构。它的工作对广大人民，特别是城市居民，有巨大的影响。我们各级的领导机关应充分重视和着重利用这一新的宣传教育工具，用它来推动工作，教育人民。各级的宣传机关，特别是党委的宣传部门，更要关心和加强对广播和收音网工作的领导，要经常讨论和审查广播工作的计划，提高广播工作的效率和节目内容的思想水平；要适当配备和有计划地训练培养广播工作的干部；以及有步骤地发展广播收音网，包括区乡的收音站和城市工厂、矿山、学校的有线广播网。关心和领导广播工作，发展和应用广播事业，应该是各级宣传机关的重要日常事务之一。
