Comrade Representatives:

Today's meeting has been very long. Everyone unanimously believes that we must resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, so I don't need to say much more. I will just say a few words on a few issues.

First, regarding the issue of counter-revolutionaries. I once heard some people say: "After liberation, isn't everything supposed to be better? Why can't these guys just do anything, why are they still counter-revolutionaries? They deserve to die!" "They deserve to die!" is right, but they still don't understand why these counter-revolutionaries want to be counter-revolutionaries. It is precisely because the people are liberated and everything is getting better, and the lives of the people are getting better and better, that the old ways of these counter-revolutionary elements are no longer working, so they want to be counter-revolutionaries.

Let us recall how our past lives were lived under the feet of counter-revolutionaries. They stood on our heads, arbitrarily acted tyrannical, arbitrarily persecuted, and arbitrarily exploited us. They lived by sucking our blood and eating our flesh. The happier the counter-revolutionaries lived, the more painful the lives of our people became. Imperialists treated our people as a piece of fat to be slaughtered at will. The bureaucratic capitalists of the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families were agents of imperialism and feudal forces, living by sucking the people's marrow. Feudal landlords seized most of the farmers' labor, making it impossible for farmers to get enough to eat and wear despite their year-round hard work. The happiness of these people was built on the suffering of the people; they were irreconcilable enemies of the people. Therefore, we wanted revolution, liberation, and to overthrow these enemies, so that we would no longer live such painful lives. (Applause from the whole audience)

We are liberated, we have won! (Loud applause from the whole audience) How much have we changed in these two years of victory? We have indeed turned ourselves over, indeed everything has gotten better, and we have entered a rational, happy, and confident life. But are these counter-revolutionaries willing to accept this? They are not willing! They want to overthrow us, to sabotage us, they want to restore the old order, to drag us back to the painful lives we had before. Therefore, the more victorious the people are, the more unwilling they are, and the more they want to be counter-revolutionaries. This is not surprising, it is inevitable.

The special agents and despots under the command of these counter-revolutionary forces depended on these counter-revolutionary forces for their livelihood. Relying on the rule of the reactionaries, they were able to arbitrarily bully the people. In the past, they were a group of gambling, drinking, and loafing elements. Of course, some of them, whose crimes were not great, bowed their heads to the people under the supervision of the people after liberation, and became new people through labor reform, but there were also many people with deep-seated habits and great power who were unwilling to bow their heads and reform, fantasizing about American imperialism making a comeback, restoring counter-revolutionary rule, and living their lives of oppressing the people again. Therefore, they continued to collude with counter-revolutionary forces to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. More than 80 percent of the counter-revolutionary gangster bosses and habitual bandits arrested this time were special agents colluding with the Kuomintang reactionaries. From this, we can see that counter-revolutionary elements cannot live with us. These counter-revolutionary elements who have committed heinous crimes and refuse to repent cannot be treated leniently. Only resolute suppression can eliminate the scourge of the people. (Applause) In the past two years, we have made one mistake, that is, we have not correctly implemented Chairman Mao's policy of combining suppression with leniency, and we have been too lenient. This has prevented these villains from receiving the punishment they deserve in a timely manner. We fully accept the workers' representatives' stern criticism of the government's excessive leniency, and we guarantee to resolutely correct this mistake. (Loud applause) On behalf of the government, I guarantee to you that we will thoroughly implement the resolution of the conference and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries. (Loud applause)

Second, we must strengthen the unity within the people and resolutely protect the democratic rights of the people. We must draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves. Chairman Mao said: Be kind to our own people, and be ruthless to the enemy. Therefore, we must proceed cautiously when dealing with counter-revolutionaries. We must not arrest the wrong person, let alone convict the wrong person. The arrest of special agents must be based on thorough investigation, solid evidence, and strict approval procedures. If we arrest the wrong person, we must immediately correct the mistake and release them, and never wrong a good person. We should be even more cautious when sentencing, and strictly follow the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries to make public judgments, with formal announcements and judgments. Any people who believe that the government's handling of counter-revolutionaries is inappropriate have the right to appeal to the People's Procuratorate or the Military Control Commission, and the Military Control Commission or the People's Procuratorate should seriously accept all appeals. We, the people, should further consolidate our unity and more clearly distinguish the boundary between the enemy and ourselves. For example, the vast majority of people in Yiguandao joined because they were ideologically unclear and deceived. What should be punished are only the handful of ringleaders who use this reactionary organization to carry out counter-revolutionary activities and those who repeatedly refuse to repent despite warnings and continue to engage in such reactionary organizational activities. As for the general public who have been deceived, as long as they are determined to break away from the reactionary organization, what remains is the issue of educating the backward thinking within the people themselves, which is by no means a counter-revolutionary issue. For example, ordinary members who were coerced or deceived into joining reactionary organizations before liberation, as long as they have not committed any crimes in the past and have actively engaged in construction with the people after liberation, should of course be regarded as our own people and should not be regarded as enemies. This is the boundary that we must clearly delineate. All issues within the ranks of the people themselves should be within the scope of democracy and should be resolved through education or criticism. Even those who have done some bad things in the past, but whose crimes are not great, as long as they are determined to repent, the people will give them a chance to be new people. Such people are both controlled and educated and reformed. As long as they have a sincere and reliable performance in the future, they can end their control and return to the ranks of the people.

Third, this meeting has demonstrated a spirit of complete unanimity. Whether it is the representatives who made accusations and speeches, or the representatives who sent many notes to the rostrum to make suggestions, they all unanimously demanded the severe suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Even the citizens who listened to the broadcast of the conference outside the venue showed extremely enthusiastic emotions. The radio station just reported that within a few short hours of the conference, the radio station received thousands of calls from citizens, more than two hundred letters, and dozens of long-distance calls, expressing their support for the conference's resolution to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries. (Applause) This shows the unanimous spirit of all citizens. This further increases the strength of our government to suppress counter-revolutionaries. I once again express to you that we will definitely resolutely carry out the tasks you have given us, and we will definitely suppress counter-revolutionary elements in accordance with the central regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries. (Loud applause) Some representatives suggested that it is too cheap for these counter-revolutionary elements to be shot, and they should also be buried alive or be executed by slicing! We believe that the attitude of the representatives who made this suggestion towards hating counter-revolutionaries is very good and very valuable; however, we feel that this method of execution is inappropriate. The reason for executing counter-revolutionary elements is because the survival of these elements is a scourge to the people, so we cannot let these scourge elements continue to survive, and only then do we adopt the method of the death penalty. This is originally a last resort to protect the interests of the people. Therefore, it is enough to use shooting to carry out the death penalty, and there is no need to adopt those very barbaric methods. I hope the representatives who made the suggestion can agree with our opinion. (Applause)

Finally, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is a matter for all the people. The reason why the Municipal People's Government was able to solve so many counter-revolutionary cases this time, and was able to smoothly interrogate and judge them after the solving, is entirely the result of the unity and active support of all citizens. On behalf of the Municipal Military Control Commission, the People's Government, and the public security and judicial organs, I express my gratitude to all citizens. We also hope that all citizens will continue to be vigilant. We must know that as long as imperialism and domestic reactionaries are not eliminated, the activities of counter-revolutionaries will exist for one day. Only by resolutely and constantly fighting against counter-revolutionary elements and constantly improving our vigilance can we build our country and improve our lives. (Loud applause)

　　在天津市区各界人民代表扩大会议上        
    黄敬市长关于镇压反革命的讲话
    编者按：三月二十九日天津市曾举行市、区各界人民代表扩大会议，讨论严惩反革命问题。黄火青在会上致开幕词，许建国兼公安局长作了关于镇压反革命的报告，黄敬市长最后在会上发表讲话。今日本报在一版刊载黄敬市长的讲话，黄火青的开幕词及许建国兼公安局长的报告，则在三版发表。
                                         各位代表同志们：
    今天我们这个会开得很长了，大家都一致认为要坚决镇压反革命，因此我不需要再说很多的话了，我只就几个问题，简单的说几句。
    第一、关于反革命问题。我曾经听到有的人说：“解放了，不是样样都好了吗？干吗都可以，为什么这些家伙，还反革命呢？真该死！”“真该死！”是对的，但他还不懂得这些反革命为什么要反革命的原因。正是人民解放了，样样都好起来了，人民的日子越过越好了，反革命分子过去那一套吃不开了，所以他们要反革命。
    我们回想一下，我们过去的生活是被反革命踏在脚底下的生活。他们站在我们的头上，任意横行霸道，任意迫害，任意剥削我们。他们是靠吸我们的血，吃我们的肉来生活的，反革命生活得越幸福，我们人民就生活得越痛苦。帝国主义把我们人民当做一块肥肉来任意宰割，官僚资本家蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族就是帝国主义和封建势力的代理人，吸食着人民的膏血来生活的；封建的地主把农民的大部劳动都侵占了，使农民终年勤劳，不能得到温饱。这些人的幸福是建筑在人民痛苦上面的，是和人民势不两立的敌人。所以我们要革命，要解放，要推翻这些敌人，不再过这痛苦的日子。（全场鼓掌）
    我们解放了，我们胜利了，（全场大鼓掌）这胜利的两年我们变化得多大呢？我们的确是翻身了，的确是样样都好起来了，我们进入了合理的幸福的充满着信心的生活里来了。可是这些反革命他们甘心吗？他们不甘心的，他们要推翻我们，要破坏我们，他们要复辟，要把我们拉回到从前那样痛苦的生活里去。所以人民越胜利。他们越不甘心，他们要反革命，这是并不奇怪的，是一定的。
    在这些反革命势力指使下的特务恶霸们就是依赖反革命势力为生活的，他们仗着反动派的统治，才能任意鱼肉人民，横行霸道，他们过去都是一群狂嫖滥赌、大吃大喝的游荡分子，固然其中有些罪恶不大的人在解放以后在人民的监视下而向人民低了头，经过劳动改造重新作人了，但也有许多积习太深权势很大的人，是不愿意低头改造的，幻想着美帝国主义卷土重来，恢复反革命统治，再过他那欺压人民的生活。所以他们继续勾结着反革命势力，从事反革命活动。这次逮捕的反革命恶霸流氓头子惯匪有百分之八十以上就是和国民党反动派勾结着的特务。从这里可以看到反革命分子是不能和我们共同生活的，对这些罪大恶极怙恶不悛的反革命分子，是宽大不得的，只有坚决的镇压，才能免除人民的祸害。（鼓掌）两年来，我们有一件错误，就是没有正确执行毛主席的镇压与宽大相结合的方针，我们宽大得过分了。使这些奸恶没有及时受到应有的惩罚，刚才工人代表对政府宽大过分的严正批评，我们完全接受，我们保证坚决改正这个错误。（大鼓掌）我代表政府向你们保证一定彻底执行大会的决议，坚决镇压反革命。（大鼓掌）
    第二、我们要加强人民内部的团结，坚决保护人民民主权利。我们必须划清敌我界限，毛主席说过：对自己人要和，对敌人要狠。因此我们在处理反革命时，必须谨慎从事。不能错抓一个人，更不能错判一个人的罪。抓特务必须经过周密的侦查，有确实的证据，经过严格的批准的手续，万一抓错了，立即改正释放，绝不使它冤枉一个好人。判罪时，就应该更加谨慎，严格地依照惩治反革命条例公开的判决，有正式的布告和判决书。任何人民对于政府处理反革命认为不当时，有向人民检察署或军事管制委员会申诉自己意见的权利，军事管制委员会或人民检察署应认真受理一切申诉。我们人民内部，应该更加巩固团结，更明确分清敌我的界限。譬如一贯道中，绝大多数的人是由于思想不清，被欺骗参加的，应该惩治的只是那些极少数利用这个反动组织，进行反革命活动阴谋的首恶和那些屡次警告不悔改的，仍继续这种反动组织活动的头子们。至于一般受欺骗的人，只要决心和反动组织断绝关系，剩下来的，就是人民自己内部向落后思想进行教育的问题，绝不是反革命的问题。又如在解放前被胁迫或被欺骗参加反动组织的普通分子，只要过去没有做过什么罪恶，解放后又积极和人民在一起从事建设，对这种人当然也应当当作自己人看待，不应把他们当作敌人看待。这就是我们必须清楚划分的界限，凡属人民行列自己内部的问题，都应划在民主范围之内，用教育或批评的方法来解决。就是过去做过些坏事，但罪恶不大的人，只要他决心悔改，人民是给他机会重新做人的。对这种人是一面管制一面加以教育改造。只要他有了真诚可靠的表现以后，也就可以结束对他们管制，回到人民的行列中来。
    第三、我们这个会议表现了充分一致的精神，不论控诉和发言的代表们，或是递许多条子到主席台提意见的代表们，都一致要求严厉镇压反革命。就是会场外面听大会广播的市民们也都表现了极热烈的情绪。刚才广播电台报告，在大会短短几个钟头内，广播电台就接到了市民们一千几百次的电话，二百多封信和几十次的长途电话，表示拥护大会坚决镇压反革命的决议。（鼓掌）这说明了全体市民们一致的精神。这就更加增加了我们政府镇压反革命的力量。我再一次向你们表示，我们一定坚决的执行你们给予我们的任务，我们一定依照着中央惩治反革命条例来镇压反革命分子。（大鼓掌）代表们有的提出枪毙这些反革命分子太便宜他们了，应该也用活埋或是用刀剐死他们！我们认为提这个意见的代表对反革命仇恨的情绪是很好的，很可宝贵的；不过这种处死刑的方法，我们觉得是不合适的。对反革命处死刑的原因，是因为这些分子的生存就是对人民的祸害，因此不能让这种祸害分子继续生存下去，才采取死刑的办法。这本是保障人民利益的一种不得已的措施，因此，用枪决来执行死刑就够了，不必要采用那些很野蛮的办法。我希望提意见的代表能同意我们这个意见。（鼓掌）
    最后，镇压反革命是全体人民的事情，这次市人民政府所以能破获这样多反革命案件，并能在破获后顺利地审问和判决，完全是全体市民团结一致积极支持的结果，我代表市军事管制委员会和人民政府和公安司法机关向全体市民表示感谢。我们并希望全体市民继续提高警惕性，须知道帝国主义和国内反动派一天不消灭，反革命的活动就存在一天，只有和反革命分子坚决不断的斗争，时时提高我们的警惕，才能把我们的国家建设，我们的生活做得更好起来。（大鼓掌）
