　　【Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 6th】 The British *Daily Worker* published on March 31st a reporter's interview with Bynes, a British soldier who had been captured and released by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies.

　　Bynes described in detail to the *Daily Worker* reporter what happened after he was captured. He said, "We often walked through villages that had been razed to the ground, past the bodies of murdered children. We thought that those children, the women who had been murdered, the people who had lost their homes and wives would beat us. But nothing happened. We ate the same food as them (referring to the Korean and Chinese People's Forces). They gave us cigarettes to smoke. They said that they had driven away the Japanese and could not allow the Americans to occupy their country and conquer them. They asked: 'If your country were invaded, what would you do?'"

　　Later, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies released Bynes and other prisoners of war. Before parting, the staff of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies said to Bynes: "Go home and work for peace! You are working people, and we are also working people - we don't need to fight each other. We wish you a happy life and struggle for peace."

　　Bynes was sent back to Britain by the British military authorities invading Korea, and he is now at home pondering the words of the staff of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. He told the *Daily Worker* reporter: "You know, they are right. It is not the working people who want to fight. Originally, none of us wanted to go to Korea. Some people insisted on refusing to go and were put in jail. The brothers who had already arrived in Korea, none of them understood why they were fighting. All they asked for was to go home, and that is exactly what I want. The American prisoners said the same thing, they didn't know why they went there. And they are no more willing to go than we are." Bynes continued: "They (referring to the Korean and Chinese People's Forces) said that the American upper class invaded their country. I don't know why we should help them invade."

　　Before being sent to Korea, Bynes had retired from the regular army. But after the US and Britain launched the war of aggression against Korea, he was drafted back into the army. Now, he is demanding to leave the army. The *Daily Worker* reporter wrote in the interview: "Today I saw him sitting by the stove, waiting for a letter allowing him to leave the army, which may be his first step in striving for peace."

　　被释英军俘虏要求退伍
    【新华社布拉格六日电】英国《工人日报》三月三十一日刊载了该报记者会见一个被朝、中人民军队俘掳后释放的英国士兵宾斯的访问记。
    宾斯对《工人日报》记者详细地叙述了被俘后的情形。他说：“我们常常步行穿过已夷为平地的村庄，走过被屠杀的儿童的身旁。我们想，那些孩子已被屠杀了的妇女们，那些丧失了家园与妻子的人会痛打我们的。可是，竟什么事也没有发生，我们跟他们（按指朝、中人民部队）吃一样的东西。他们给我们烟吸。他们说，他们已经赶走了日本人，不能听任美国人来占领他们的国土与征服他们。他们问道：‘假使你们的国家受到侵略，你会怎么办呢？’”
    后来朝、中人民军队释放了宾斯和其他一批俘虏。朝、中人民军队的工作人员在临别前对宾斯说：“回家为和平而工作吧！你是劳动人民，我们也是劳动人民——我们彼此不需要打仗。祝你生活愉快，为和平而奋斗。”
    宾斯被侵朝英军当局遣送回到了英国，他现在正在家中思索着朝、中人民军队工作人员对他说的话。他对《工人日报》记者说：“你知道，他们是对的。愿意打仗的不是劳动人民。本来，我们没有一个人愿意到朝鲜去。曾经有人坚持拒绝去，就被关进监牢了。已经到了朝鲜的弟兄们，没有一个人明白他是为什么打仗的。他们所要求的就是回家，这也正是我的要求。美国俘虏们也这样说，他们并不知道他们为什么到那里去。而且他们并不比我们更愿意去。”宾斯接着说：“他们（按指朝、中人民部队）说，美国的上层分子侵略他们的国家。我不知道为什么我们要帮助他们侵略。”
    宾斯在被派到朝鲜去以前，已从正规军中退伍出来。但美英发动侵朝战争以后，他又被征调入伍。现在，他正要求脱离军队。《工人日报》记者在访问记中写道：“今天我看见他坐在火炉旁，正等候着一封允许他脱离军队的信，这或许是他争取和平的第一步。”
