Xuzhou's Industrial and Commercial Circles
Over Five Thousand People Gathered to Pay Taxes

    Xuzhou City's 64 industries, led by the kerosene industry, gathered over 5,000 people on the 10th to pay taxes collectively. A grand parade was held after the meeting. Their slogans were: "Pay taxes early, enrich the national treasury, and strengthen the economic fighting power!" The industrial and commercial circles of the city also challenged the industrial and commercial circles of other cities and counties in the province, guaranteeing that they will continue to pay taxes collectively in the future. This is a concrete manifestation of the patriotic actions of the industrial and commercial circles of Xuzhou City in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea.

　　徐州市工商业界
　　五千余人集会缴税
    徐州市工商界六十四个行业，以煤油业为首，十日集合五千余人，集会缴税。会后并举行盛大游行。他们的口号是：“提前缴税，充实国库，增强经济战斗力量”。该市工商界并向本省各市县工商界挑战，保证今后继续集体缴税。这是徐州市工商界在抗美援朝运动中又一次爱国行动的具体表现。
