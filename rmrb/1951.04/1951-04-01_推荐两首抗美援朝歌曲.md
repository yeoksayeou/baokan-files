　　Recommending Two Songs of Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    Guo Nai'an
    I. "Defeat the American Wolves" (This song was published in this newspaper on November 30th of last year, on the third page. It is being republished here because the content has been slightly modified.) This song has been circulating in the North China region. Its lyrics are a poem popular among the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front. It centrally explains the significance of the Resist America and Aid Korea movement, and expresses the new heroic spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which combines patriotism and internationalism. The melody is vigorous and simple, expressing optimism, firmness, and confidence, which is in line with the feelings of the masses today. Therefore, it has become not only a good military song but also a good mass song. When singing this song, one should be full of emotion, with a spirit of courage and confidence, and not be sluggish. The first beat of each measure should be strengthened. The two sentences "China's good sons and daughters, unite closely" should be sung continuously and with momentum. The phrase "Resist America and Aid Korea" in the song has been changed to "Resist America and Aid Korea," and the melody has been shortened by one note, which should be sung concisely and powerfully. The markings above the four notes are to fully maintain the length of the notes and should not be sung as "staccato."
    II. "The People of the World Unite Tightly" was originally a song titled "The Strength of Sino-Soviet Unity is Great," and some of the lyrics have been modified during its circulation. The basic reason why this song is popular is that it expresses the Chinese people's feelings of victory, with enthusiasm, strength, and vitality. This feeling is the keynote of the Chinese people's feelings after liberation. If the songwriter grasps this basic feeling, he has obtained the necessary guarantee for the spread of his work. This song is an example. On the other hand, this melody also runs through national characteristics, is easy to learn and remember, and is not monotonous, which is another reason for its spread. When singing this song, it is necessary to grasp the enthusiastic and lively mood, and the strong and secondary strong beats in the four beats should be appropriately strengthened. In places with faster rhythms, such as "Sino-Korean people" and "imperialism," the pronunciation should be clear.

　　推荐两首抗美援朝歌曲
    郭乃安
    一、《打败美国野心狼》（此歌曾在本报去年十一月三十日第三版刊登过，现因内容稍有修改，故重刊于此。）这首歌已在华北地区流传。它的歌词是流行在朝鲜前线中国人民志愿军中的一首诗。它集中地说明了抗美援朝运动的意义，表现了中国人民志愿军的爱国主义与国际主义相结合的新英雄主义气概。曲调雄健而朴素，表现出乐观、坚定、充满信心的感情，这种感情和今天的群众感情相符合。因此它不仅成为一首好的军歌，也是一首好的群众歌曲。唱这首歌时，要情绪饱满，要有勇往直前，充满信心的感情，不要拖拉。每小节的第一拍都要加强，“中国好儿女，齐心团结紧”那两句每句都要唱得连贯，有气势。曲中“抗美援朝鲜”一句已改为“抗美援朝”，曲调省去一个音，要唱得简洁有力。四个音上面的记号是要充分保持音的长度，不要唱成“断音”。
    二、《全世界人民团结紧》原是题为《中苏团结力量大》的一首歌，在流传中部分词句有了修改。这首歌所以受到欢迎，基本的原因还是在于它表现了中国人民胜利的感情，热情有力，活泼健壮。这种感情是解放后中国人民感情的基调，歌曲作者如果掌握住这种基本感情，便为他的作品的流传取得了必要的保证。这首歌便是一个实例。另一方面这个曲调还贯串着民族特色，易学易记，又不单调，是它流传的另一原因。唱这首歌时要掌握住热烈而活泼的情绪，四拍子中的强拍和次强拍要适当予以加强，节奏较快的地方如“中朝人民”“帝国主义”，要唱清字音。
