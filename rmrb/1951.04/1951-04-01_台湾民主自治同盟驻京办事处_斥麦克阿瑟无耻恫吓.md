　　Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Beijing Office
    Denounces MacArthur's Shameless Intimidation
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Beijing Office of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League issued a written statement on March 31, denouncing MacArthur's arrogant intimidation and insult of the Chinese and Korean people. The statement pointed out: The Chinese and Korean people, who have stood up and have rich fighting experience, cannot be intimidated! Insults cannot be tolerated! The result of the war criminal MacArthur's statement will be: to completely expose the hideous face of the aggressor in front of the people of the world; to add to the record of broken promises. The League also stated in its statement: "We, together with the people of the whole country, must more deeply and extensively carry out the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, and step up our work to drive the American aggressors out of Korea and Taiwan!"
