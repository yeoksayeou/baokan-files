    (4) Wang Shan thought, Fang Luoyi's words weren't right. If they planted late, "the cotton wouldn't be worth anything, a year's work wasted." The next day he went to the field to sow. He dug with a small hoe, and less than three finger-widths deep, he found moist soil.
    (5) At this time, Erben also came to the field to sow. Wang Shan discussed with him about finding a way to open up the dry soil on top and sow on the moist soil. Erben also thought it was a good idea. But, what could they use to break open the dry soil?
    (6) A plow was too sharp, a drill was too light, and the two of them couldn't think of a solution for a long time. Later, Erben took off his shoe and shook the dirt out of it. Wang Shan suddenly had an idea and said, "If we tie the shoe soles to the tips of the drill feet, wouldn't that work?"
    (7) The two of them hurried back and asked the members of the mutual aid team to try out this new method. Fang Luoyi, seeing them like this, tilted his head and said they were fooling around.

    （四）王山一想，房洛义的话不对头，如果种晚了，“霜花不值钱，白费一年工”。第二天他便到地里去点种。小锄刨下去，不到三指深，就见了湿土。
    （五）这时，二笨也到地里来点种。王山就和他商量，想办法把上层的干土豁开，在湿土上耩播。二笨也觉得很好。可是，用什么东西来豁干土呢？
    （六）用犁太尖，用耧太空，两人半天没有想出办法来。后来，二笨脱下鞋子来，抖落鞋里的土，王山忽然灵机一动说：“把鞋底绑在耧脚尖上，不就成了吗？”
    （七）两个人赶忙往回跑，叫互助组的人都来试验这个新办法。房洛义看到他俩这个样子，歪着脑袋说他们在胡闹。
