To encourage the exchange of native products and invigorate the rural economy, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has, starting April 1st, further reduced less-than-carload (LCL) freight rates. Because LCL transportation has higher costs, the original regulations stipulated that the freight rate be double that of a full carload. This was reduced to a 70% surcharge over the full carload rate on August 1st of last year. This time, to accommodate the transport of native and special products that are difficult to assemble into full carloads, and to benefit the vast number of small producers, it is specifically stipulated that for goods weighing more than three tons, the prescribed freight rate will be reduced by 10%, and for those exceeding six tons, it will be reduced by 20%.

In addition, from April 1st to the end of June, all North China native products such as black dates, date flour, persimmons, dried persimmons, and hawthorns shipped from railways in the north will be charged half of the current freight rate. Native medicinal materials such as Scutellaria baicalensis, Anemarrhena asphodeloides, Bupleurum chinense, Atractylodes lancea, Platycodon grandiflorus, Rheum officinale, and Acanthopanax gracilistylus will be charged 30% less than the current freight rate. Sweet potatoes will be charged 20% less than the current freight rate. From April 1st to the end of October, all fresh fish and shellfish (including fresh fish, live fish, frozen fish, clams, shrimp, crabs, shellfish, etc.), whether transported in full carloads, LCL, or as parcels, will be subject to a 50% reduction in the prescribed freight rate.

　　便利土产特产交流
　  铁道部再度降低零担货物运价
    为鼓励土产交流，活跃农村经济，中央人民政府铁道部已自四月一日起再次减低零担货物运价。零担货物运输因成本较高，原规定运价比照整车加倍，去年八月一日减为比照整车加价百分之七十强。此次为了照顾不易凑成整车的土产、特产运输和广大的小生产者，特别规定凡货物重量超过三吨者，按规定运价率减收一成，超过六吨者减二成。
    此外，自四月一日起至六月底止，凡自北方各铁路起运的华北土产黑枣、枣面、柿子、柿饼、山楂等，均按现行运价减半收费；黄苓、知母、柴胡、苍术、桔梗、大黄、五加皮等土产药材，均按现行运价减三成；甘薯按现行运价减二成。自四月一日起至十月底止，凡鲜鱼介类（包括鲜鱼、活鱼、冻鱼、蛤、虾、蟹、贝介等）无论整车零担及包裹运输，一律按规定运价率减价五成。
