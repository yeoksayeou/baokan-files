International Developments

　　Thailand Peace Signature Count Exceeds 100,000
　　Despite various obstructions from the Phibun anti-government in Thailand, the people's peace signature campaign continues to develop. According to the Thai-language "Political Weekly," as of March 17th, a total of 117,745 Thai people had signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal in the nineteen weeks. The number of signatures is now increasing.
　　Spring Plowing Progresses Smoothly in the German Democratic Republic
　　This year's spring plowing has already begun in the German Democratic Republic. Farmers are using new tractors and various other agricultural machines, all of which are manufactured in the German Democratic Republic or supplied by the Soviet Union. According to an announcement by the Ministry of Machine Building of the German Democratic Republic, state-owned enterprises have overfulfilled the production of agricultural machinery parts needed for spring plowing. Farmers have received strong assistance from state-owned agricultural machinery stations. Many state-owned agricultural machinery stations have guaranteed to complete the sowing work ahead of schedule. The people of the German Democratic Republic want to defend world peace by stepping up production.
　　Controls on West German Arms Industry Actually Lifted
　　The American, British, and French occupation authorities in Bonn promulgated a new order on the "control" of West German industry. In practice, the implementation of this "decree" cancels the controls on the West German arms industry. According to this order, all restrictions on German shipbuilding have been lifted. Steel production has been authorized to exceed the limit of 11.1 million tons. Strategic materials such as aluminum, ball bearings, hard chrome, chlorine, petroleum, and synthetic rubber can also be produced. This act of openly drawing West Germany into the aggressive plans of American imperialism is a provocation to the peace hopes of the German people and the people of Europe.
　　Fascist Military Organizations Revived in West Germany
　　A large number of fascist military organizations have recently been established in West Germany. The task of all these organizations is to incite revanchist sentiments among the West German people and instill militaristic ideas, at the behest of Eisenhower, thereby driving the West German people to act as cannon fodder. The notorious "Steel Helmet League," which has been re-established in Frankfurt, is one of these fascist military organizations, and it will receive funding from West German reactionary political parties, arms manufacturers, and the Adenauer government. But the German people clearly remember that Hitler's militarism led them to destruction, and they will never allow the revival of fascist military organizations.

　  泰国和平签名人数已超过十万
    泰国人民的和平签名运动，在銮披汶反动政府的多方阻挠下继续发展。据泰文《政治周报》报道：泰国人民在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名的，在三月十七日为止的十九个星期中，共有十一万七千七百四十五人。签名的人数现正愈来愈多。
　  德意志民主共和国春耕顺利进行
    德意志民主共和国今年的春耕已经开始。农民们使用着新的拖拉机和其他各种农业机器，这些新的农业机器都是德意志民主共和国制造出来，或者是由苏联所供给的。据德意志民主共和国机器制造部宣布，国营企业已经超额完成了春耕所需要的农业机器零件的生产。农民们得到了国营农业机器站的有力帮助。许多国营农业机器站都保证在预定期限之前完成播种的工作。德意志民主共和国的人民要以加紧生产来保卫世界和平。
　  西德军火工业的管制竟被取消
    美、英、法三国占领当局在波恩颁布了关于“管制”西德工业的新命令。实际上实行这一“法令”就是取消了西德军火工业的管制。根据这项命令，对德国造船业的一切限制都已取消。钢的生产量已获准可以超过一千一百一十万吨的限额。铝、组织滚珠、合硵、氯、石油和人造橡胶等战略物资也可以生产。这种把西德公开地拉进美帝国主义侵略计划以内的行为，是对于德国人民和欧洲人民的和平希望的一种挑衅。
　  法西斯军事组织在西德复活
    大量法西斯主义的军事组织最近已在西德成立。所有这些组织的任务，都是奉了艾森豪威尔的命令，企图煽起西德人民复仇主义的情绪、灌输军国主义的思想，从而驱使西德人民充当炮灰。在法兰克福重新成立的臭名昭著的“钢盔队”，就是这种法西斯军事组织之一，它将从西德反动政党、军火制造商和阿登纳政府获得经费。但是德国人民清楚地记得，希特勒的军国主义曾把他们导向毁灭，他们决不容许法西斯军事组织的复活。
