The Cultural Department of the Political Department of the North China Military Region Holds a Meeting on Drama and Music Creation
　　The Cultural Department of the Political Department of the North China Military Region recently held an army-wide meeting on drama and music creation. The purpose of the meeting was to clarify a fundamental issue in creative thinking: how to express the ideological essence of the new people of the People's Liberation Army, to create heroic figures profoundly and powerfully, and to create works worthy of the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army. At the meeting, Du Feng, Hu Ke, Zhao Xueshi, and others made central speeches on the creation and revision process of the three dramas "Fighting for Peace and Happiness," "Heroic Position," and "Eating 'Eggs'." Zhang Fei made a central speech on the anti-American and aid-Korea music creation in the North China troops.
　　During the discussion, everyone realized that only by strengthening theoretical study and clarifying the author's class viewpoint can they correctly analyze life and correctly grasp and express the essence of the People's Liberation Army. For example, the opera "Iron Warrior," which depicts the unyielding will of Company Commander Zhang, is successful, but it does not simultaneously show that he is constantly thinking of actively attacking the enemy, which should be a more important aspect of the heroic quality. When performing "Breaking Through the Darkness Before Dawn," the scene of burying the guns was handled in a very low-key manner, without emphasizing that this was a change in the method of struggle, and that in any case, the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army possessed a strong fighting will and confidence in victory.
　　Everyone agreed that going deep into the troops to enrich life should be unified with their own ideological transformation.
　　The meeting further corrected the proletarian standpoint and viewpoint, criticized the tendency to be enthusiastic about writing about "backward transformation," that is, to concentrate on describing the very few backward factors that are being overcome, and not to correctly analyze the social and historical roots of these factors; not to explore and express the class essence of the so-called "backward elements"; not to understand that the People's Liberation Army not only comes from the working people, but also is the most outstanding part of the working people. Only by correctly depicting them can we correctly express the essence of the troops and produce works worthy of the appearance of the People's Liberation Army. After the meeting, Deputy Director Zhang Zhixiang made a conclusion, giving a detailed explanation on how to express the ideological essence of the new people—the ideological essence of the People's Liberation Army.
　　
Wuhan's Workers' Literary and Art Propaganda Activities Promote Patriotic Production Competition
　　Wuhan's workers' literary and art propaganda activities have promoted the patriotic production competition in various factories and improved the political awareness of the workers. In the propaganda activities, a group of excellent worker literary and art authors and collective creation groups emerged in various factories in Wuhan. Now, 63 factory literary and art groups with more than 200 people have been organized in various factories in the city; more than 400 people have individually contacted the Wuhan Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Twenty-seven kinds of small series of literary and artistic works such as novels, poems, Yangko dances, and allegro plays created by workers have been published. These literary and artistic activities are closely integrated with the actual life of the workers and every political movement. Zhang Zhiping, a staff member of the Wudong Factory of the Yuehan Railway, used the fact that the workers of the factory used a long-dilapidated abandoned furnace to manufacture a three-ton steam hammer seat as the subject matter, and wrote the novel "Steam Hammer Seat," which powerfully reflected the creative spirit of the working class and was loved by the majority of workers. Li Hegong, a worker at the Hankou Wharf Handling Station, wrote the script "Anti-Feudal Head," based on his own experience and the crimes of feudal heads exploiting and oppressing workers, which resonated with the majority of workers after it was performed at the wharf. The collective creation group of the Jiang'an Machine Factory Theater Troupe of the Jinghan Railway wrote more than ten scripts such as "For Eternal Happiness," "She Understood," "Red Flag," and "Unbearable Anymore." After these scripts were performed in the factory, many workers and work groups worked harder and became labor models and model groups. For example, after watching the play "Red Flag," worker Liu Qinghua intensified his technical research and used waste to create a screw bed, thus becoming one of the city's labor models. In order to further improve and popularize literary and artistic work, and further implement the policy of literary and artistic work serving the workers and serving production, the Wuhan Federation of Literary and Art Circles specially convened the city's second congress of literary and artistic workers from March 26 to 30, summarizing the achievements and experiences of the workers' literary and artistic movement, and put forward a call to the city's literary and artistic circles to greet this year's "May Day" with a new batch of creations.
　　
Shandong Province Uses Propaganda Posters to Promote the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
　　The propaganda posters for Resist America, Aid Korea printed by the "Chinese People's Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression" are highly valued by the Shandong Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department and the Government Cultural and Educational Department. Some of these paintings were distributed to organs as reference materials for cadres to conduct current affairs education; some were distributed to districts to be mastered by propaganda and education cadres to carry out publicity to the masses in various forms. For example, organizing student propaganda teams, twisting Yangko dances and posting propaganda paintings on wooden signs, taking turns to publicize in various places; setting up propaganda sheds in the market, putting propaganda paintings in the sheds, and having special personnel to explain them. Rural drama troupes also brought propaganda paintings to rural areas everywhere. Before the drama performance, the audience was allowed to watch the paintings first; some also took the opportunity of holding mass meetings to bring the paintings to the masses. In short, various different methods are used to let the propaganda paintings meet the masses, and these paintings are warmly welcomed by the masses. Generally, cadres also like these paintings very much, and take them as materials for learning or for conducting publicity to the masses.
　　
Northwest Literary and Art Circles Launch the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
　　Literary and art workers in the Northwest region actively participated in the patriotic propaganda activities of Resist America, Aid Korea, which greatly developed the region's literary and art work. Literary and art workers, writers, artists, and folk artists in various parts of the Northwest have successively created nearly a thousand songs, hundreds of propaganda paintings, and many allegro and drum lyrics in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. There are more than 20,000 art wall newspapers in Xi'an alone.
　　In the literary and art propaganda in Xi'an, more than 90 programs in more than ten different forms were performed. The content of these programs, 66 percent was related to Resist America, Aid Korea, and the rest was to publicize various policies of the people's government and praise the peasants for turning over. Yan'an held an art exhibition during the Spring Festival, and many of the exhibits were paper-cuts and window decorations of Resist America, Aid Korea created by local peasant women.

　　The fourth team of the land reform work team organized by the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles went to the suburbs of Shanghai in early April to participate in the work. The working areas are Huacun Township in Longhua, Lingqiao Township in Gaoqiao, and Nanxiang Jiangqiao Township in Zhenru.

  华北军区政治部文化部召开戏剧音乐创作工作会议
    华北军区政治部文化部最近召开全军戏剧音乐创作工作会议。会议目的是为了要明确创作思想上的一个根本问题：如何表现人民解放军新的人物的思想本质，深刻而有力地创造英雄人物的形象，创作与人民解放军的丰功伟业相称的作品。会上杜烽、胡可、赵学诗等就《为和平幸福而战》、《英雄的阵地》、《吃“鸡蛋”》三剧的创作修改经过，做了中心发言。张非就华北部队中抗美援朝的音乐创作做中心发言。
    在讨论中，大家认识到只有加强理论学习，使作者的阶级观点明确，才能正确分析生活，正确掌握与表现人民解放军的本质。如《钢铁战士》歌剧，描写张排长不屈服的意志，是成功的，但没有同时表现他时时刻刻都在想法主动地打击敌人，这应该是英雄品质更重要的一面；演出《冲破黎明前的黑暗》时，把埋枪的场面处理得很低沉，没有强调这是改变斗争方式，在任何情况下，人民解放军的指战员都具备着旺盛的战斗意志和胜利的信心。
    大家一致认为：深入部队丰富生活应该和自己的思想改造，统一起来。
    会上进一步端正了无产阶级的立场观点，批判了热中于写“落后转变”的偏向，即把许多正在克服中的极少部分的落后因素集中起来加以描写，不能正确分析产生这些因素的社会的历史的根源；不能把所谓“落后分子”的阶级本质发掘和表现出来；不了解人民解放军不仅来自劳动人民，而且是劳动人民当中最优秀的一部分。只有正确地描写他们，才能正确地表现部队的本质，产生与人民解放军的面貌相称的作品。会后由张致祥副主任作结论，就如何表现新人物的思想本质——人民解放军的思想本质，作了详尽的说明。
  武汉市工人文艺宣传活动推动了爱国主义生产竞赛
    武汉市的工人文艺宣传活动，推动了各工厂爱国主义生产竞赛并提高了工人群众的政治觉悟。在宣传活动中，武汉各工厂涌现出一批优秀的工人文艺作者和集体创作小组。现在全市各工厂已组织了有二百余人的六十三个工厂文艺小组；与武汉市文学艺术界联合会取得个别联系的有四百余人。已出版工人创作的小说、诗歌、秧歌、快板剧等文艺作品的小丛书达二十七种。这些文艺活动与工人的实际生活和每一政治运动都紧密地结合着。粤汉铁路武东工厂职员张秩平，以该厂工人们利用久已失修的废炉，制造出三吨重的汽锤座的事实作为题材，写成《汽锤座》小说，有力地反映了工人阶级的创造精神，获得广大工人群众的喜爱。汉口码头搬运站工人李和恭把自己亲身的经历和封建把头剥削和压迫工人的罪行，写成《反封建把头》剧本，在码头上演出后，引起广大工人的共鸣。京汉铁路江岸机厂剧团的集体创作组写了《为了永远有幸福》、《她明白了》、《红旗》、《不可再忍》等十余个剧本，这些剧本在该厂演出后，有不少工人和工作小组加倍努力工作，成为劳动模范和模范小组。如工人刘清华看了《红旗》一剧后，便加紧钻研技术，利用废物制造成螺丝床，因而成为全市劳动模范之一。武汉市文联，为进一步提高与普及文艺工作，进一步贯彻文艺工作为工人服务，为生产服务的方针，特于三月二十六日至三十日召开了全市第二届文学艺术工作者代表大会，总结了工人文艺运动的成绩和经验，并向全市文艺界提出了以一批新的创作来迎接今年“五一”的号召。
  山东省运用宣传画推动抗美援朝运动
    “中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会”所印制的抗美援朝的宣传画，很受到山东党委宣传部门和政府文教部门的重视。他们把这些画有的分配到机关，作为对干部进行时事教育的参考材料；有的分配到区里由宣教干部掌握，利用各种形式对群众进行宣传。如组织学生宣传队，扭着秧歌把宣传画贴在木牌上，轮流到各地宣传；在集市上搭宣传棚，把宣传画放在棚里，由专人进行讲解。农村剧团并把宣传画带到了各地农村中去，在戏剧演出前，先让观众看画；也有的利用开群众大会的机会，把画拿来给群众看。总之，运用各种不同的方式，使宣传画与群众见面，这些画受到群众的热烈欢迎。一般干部也都很喜爱这些画，拿它们当作学习或向群众进行宣传的材料。
  西北文艺界展开抗美援朝运动
    西北地区的文艺工作者积极参加抗美援朝爱国主义宣传活动，使该区文艺工作获得了很大的发展。西北各地的文艺工作者、作家、艺术家以及民间艺人，在抗美援朝运动中曾先后创作了近千首歌曲，数百种宣传画和许多快板、鼓词等。西安一地即有美术墙报二万帧以上。
    在西安市文艺宣传中，演出了十余种不同形式的九十多个节目。这些节目的内容，百分之六十六是有关抗美援朝的，其余是宣传人民政府各种政策和歌颂农民翻身的。延安在春节中举办了美术展览会，展览品中有很多是当地农妇们所创作的抗美援朝的剪纸和窗花。
  上海市文艺工作者参加土地改革
    上海市文联组织的土地改革工作队第四队，于四月初分赴上海郊区参加工作。工作地区是龙华的华村乡，高桥的凌桥乡，真茹的南翔江桥乡等。队员中有电影演员蒋天流、黄宗英、蒋君超，国画家余白墅，作家梁文若、何公超等。此外影剧协会熊佛西、张骏祥、王人美、黄晨、周伯勋、毛羽、林榛、崔超明等，也组织了土地改革访问团，分赴土地改革已完成的典型实验乡，访问没收、征收、分配了土地的区域，了解土地改革实行后的农村情况，并帮助当地村干部进行宣教工作。
