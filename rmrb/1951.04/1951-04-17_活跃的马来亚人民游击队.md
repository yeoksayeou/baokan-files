　　Active Malayan People's Guerrilla
    Zhou Yi
    As the British colonial rulers madly attacked the people of Malaya, the Malayan people's guerrillas were growing and strengthening in battle. These fearless warriors haunt the jungles of Malaya, fighting the British imperialist military police, bravely engaging in arduous battles. A squadron of the Malayan People's Guerrilla active in the West Peng area (western Pahang) fought eight battles in three months, creating no small results. In today's Malaya, it is unknown how many fighting teams like this exist, severely hitting the British colonial army. The following is the combat experience of a squadron of the Malayan People's Guerrilla after September 1950 for three months.
  I. Attacking British Imperialist Military Police Stations
    After a period of rest and reorganization, a certain squadron received a new combat mission in early September—to attack the enemy stronghold of Kuala Krau. It is the location of an important railway station in West Peng, with a rubber plantation nearby. The main purpose of this attack was to raid the military police stationed there.
    The team set off on the night of September 10th and arrived at the small town at dawn the next day, immediately surrounding it on all sides. Before the sun rose, the soldiers on the front and flanks opened fire, containing the enemies in the police station. The search team took the opportunity to enter the street, searching for sporadic police officers, and carried out propaganda among the people. The guerrillas burned down the station and the "Red-Hair Building" (referring to the British devils' houses), continuing to pursue the military police hiding under the train carriages. In a gun battle, three special police officers were killed. Two British devils saw the situation was not good and automatically crawled out and surrendered their weapons. The enemies on the police station side were also unable to raise their heads under the heavy fire. At this time, it was already broad daylight, and the enemy troops from other places probably got the intelligence and came to reinforce with armored vehicles and steamers loaded with a large number of military police from the railway and Pahang River. The commander saw that the mission had been completed and immediately ordered a retreat. The soldiers heard the loud bugle call and successively concentrated towards the mountainous area of the rubber plantation, preparing to transfer. The guard team continued to block the reinforcing enemies, covering the retreat of the team. In the end, the guard team also successfully completed its mission, safely left the firing line, and caught up with the main force.
    A few days later, they attacked another enemy stronghold, the Mengyuan Station, annihilated the local police, and plundered a batch of ammunition and military supplies to replenish their strength and prepare for greater battles.
  II. Attacking on Railways and Highways
    At dawn, the guerrilla warriors had already selected the terrain and ambushed on both sides of the Mentakab railway. This is a section with jungles and grassy swamps, easy to hide. There are also two small hills on both sides, which can be used for guarding and watching. This is a good place for an attack. The target the troops were waiting for was a special police patrol car. However, from morning to noon, no patrol car was seen. So it was decided to capture the special police personnel on passing passenger and freight cars. Several comrades first dismantled two sections of track and prepared firepower to wait for the train to arrive.
    Hearing the whistle blowing in the distance, the soldiers knew that the battle was about to begin, and everyone's emotions suddenly became tense. Probably the track was not dismantled well, because when the train passed, it did not overturn, but only suffered a violent shock, and then continued to advance. But the fierce machine-gun fire stopped it. The soldiers swarmed down from the hillside, first telling the people not to panic, and then searching every car for hiding special police. The special police who jumped out of the car and fled were all killed, and several cowards hiding in the front of the car and the toilet were dragged out. They surrendered their weapons.
    The second step for the guerrillas was to have the passengers take their luggage and gather in the open space to explain the policy to them. The masses enthusiastically took out money to donate, but the guerrillas politely declined. Only their "identity cards" were confiscated. Several prisoners were also released. Only one particularly wicked henchman was executed on the spot after being reported and accused by the masses. Finally, the soldiers burned ninety loads of rubber along with the train, and then left to the cheers of the masses.
    On October 21st, the troops fought a victorious battle on the highway 44 miles away from Mentakab. At more than 4 o'clock in the afternoon, as the sun was about to set, a special police armored vehicle, which they believed to be a safe fortress, drove along the highway. They were out on patrol and search. When the armored vehicle approached the guerrilla cordon, a burst of machine-gun fire and three grenades damaged it and it fell to the side of the road. But the enemies inside were not all dead. The machine gun on the roof frantically fired at the guerrilla positions. The battle unfolded. Before long, another armored vehicle came from behind to join the battle, and also suffered the same fate as the previous armored vehicle. By the time more armored vehicles arrived to reinforce, the guerrilla warriors had already left far away. This battle shattered the enemy's myth that armored vehicles were "safe fortresses."
    On October 30th, the guerrillas also fought a similar battle. Within six hours, the guerrillas intercepted ten vehicles of all kinds. Those belonging to merchants were left untouched and allowed to drive away. Trucks carrying rubber and stones belonging to the British colonial government were burned, and finally two trucks transporting explosives were captured, and some explosives and guns and ammunition were seized.
  III. Defeating an Enemy Detachment
    The more active the guerrillas, the more frantic the enemy's suppression. They not only captured and drove away the people in the villages within the guerrilla activity area, but also cut down and burned all the trees everywhere. They thought that this would bring the guerrillas to their death. They did not know that guerrilla warriors can survive and fight in any harsh environment. A certain squadron of the guerrillas annihilated a detachment of the 3rd Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Malay Regiment on a bare hilltop in Nanmai that had been deforested by the enemy.
    On the morning of October 20th, the guerrilla warriors were ambushed on a high ground next to the Mentakab-Bentong highway, waiting for military vehicles that came out to search for guerrillas. Shortly before noon, four trucks drove from the Bentong side. When the last two trucks arrived, the guerrilla warriors began to fire intensely. At this time, the first two had crossed the guerrilla cordon, and the enemies on the car got off the car and wanted to resist stubbornly. But they were stopped by the guerrillas' fierce firepower, and they had to hug a light machine gun and ran to another hill next to the highway and opened fire. The enemies on the latter two cars were hit, some of them jumped out of the car in a panic, and fired back lying under the car, and some remained on the car and fired back with machine guns. The guerrillas' grenades gave the enemy a fatal blow, forcing the remnant enemy to use smoke bombs and tear gas, fleeing in panic in the smoke, leaving behind more than twenty corpses and the wreckage of four trucks.
  IV. Growing Up in Battle
    The combat life of the guerrillas is indeed extremely difficult. They must deal with the enemy's "pursuit and suppression" and strike the enemy at the appropriate time. They do not have sufficient food, and their ammunition and weapons must be obtained from the enemy. Sometimes they can only cook banana leaves to satisfy their hunger, and if they get a little rice, they can only eat half full. However, these difficulties have not affected the soldiers' fighting will in the slightest, but have instead increased their hatred for the enemy.
    The enthusiastic support of the masses strengthened the soldiers' confidence in victory. Although the British colonialists implemented extremely brutal suppression, the people everywhere spared no effort to support their own army with all their strength. When they saw the guerrillas arrive, they happily took out the food buried underground and resolutely refused to accept money.
    On a clear moonlit night, the soldiers were packing up and preparing to depart, and the commander said to the soldiers in a loud voice: "Our struggle is arduous, we have many difficulties, but we have countless masses supporting us, and we will definitely overcome the difficulties and achieve victory!"
    With a magnificent mood, the soldiers embarked on the journey to meet new battles!

　　活跃的马来亚人民游击队
    周衣
    当英国殖民地统治者对马来亚人民进行疯狂进攻的时候，马来亚人民的游击队正在战斗中成长壮大。这些无畏的勇士们出没在马来亚的丛林中，与英国帝国主义者的军警周旋，英勇地进行艰苦的战斗。活跃在西彭地区（彭亨西部）的马来亚人民游击队某中队，三个月内打了八次仗，创造了不小的战果。在今天的马来亚，像这样的战斗队伍不知有多少，他们严重地打击着英国殖民者的军队。下面就是这一支马来亚人民游击队一个中队一九五○年九月以后三个月的战斗经历。
  一、袭击英帝国主义的军警驻地
    经过了一个时期的休整，某中队在九月初接受了新的战斗任务——攻击敌人的据点瓜拉吉挠。它是西彭一个重要铁路车站的所在地，附近有一片橡胶园。这一次的出击，主要的目的是袭击驻在该地的军警。
    队伍在九月十日的夜里出发，第二天的拂晓到达了这个小镇，立即从四面把它包围起来。太阳还没出来，在正面和侧面的战士打响了枪，牵制住警察局的敌人。搜索队便乘机进入街里，搜索零星的警察，并向老百姓进行宣传。游击队烧毁了车站和红毛楼（指英国鬼子的房舍），继续追击躲在火车厢底下的军警，一场枪战，击毙了三名特警。两个英国鬼子看见形势不对，自动爬出来缴了枪。警察局那边的敌人也被打得抬不起头。这时候天已大亮，别地方的敌军大概得到了情报，以装甲车和汽船装着大量的军警从铁路和彭亨河开来增援。司令员看见任务已经完成，即下令撤退。战士们听见了响亮的号角，即陆续向橡胶园的山地集中，准备转移。警戒队继续阻击增援的敌人，掩护队伍撤退。最后，警戒队也成功地完成了任务，安全离开了火线，赶上大队。
    几天以后，他们又袭击另外一个敌人的据点轰园车站，歼灭了该地的驻警，卤获了一批弹药和军用物资，来充实自己的力量，准备更大的战斗。
  二、在铁路和公路上出击
    黎明的时候，游击队的战士已选择好地形，埋伏在而连突铁路的两旁。这是一段有丛林和草芭的地段，容易隐蔽。两边还有两个小丘，可以警戒了望。这是进行袭击的好地方。部队等待的对象是特警的巡逻车。但是，从早上到中午，却没有看到巡逻车的影子。于是决定捕捉过路的客货车上的特警人员。几个同志先拆掉了两节路轨，并准备好射击的火力，以等待火车的到来。
    远远听到汽笛呜呜叫，战士们知道战斗就要开始了，大家的情绪顿形紧张。大概是路轨没有拆好，当火车开过时并没有翻倒，只是受了一下剧烈的震动，便继续前进。但是猛烈的机关枪火力却把它喝止住了。战士们从山坡上蜂涌下来，首先告诉老百姓不要惊恐，然后在每一个车厢内搜索躲藏的特警。跳车逃跑的特警都被击毙了，躲在车头和厕所的几个怕死鬼都被拖出来。他们缴了枪。
    游击队第二步的工作是让乘客们拿着自己的行李，集中到空地上，向他们解释政策。群众们一个个热烈地掏出钱来捐献，都被游击队谢绝了。只没收了他们的“身份证”。几个俘虏也释放了。只有一个作恶多端的狗腿，经群众检举与控诉后，把他就地处决。最后战士们并把九十担橡胶连同火车一块焚毁，然后在群众的欢呼声中离去。
    十月二十一日，部队在离而连突四十四英里的公路上打了胜利的一仗。下午四点多钟，太阳快下山了，有一辆特警自认为是安全堡垒的装甲车沿着公路驶来，他们是出来巡逻搜索的。当这辆装甲车走近游击队警戒线的时候，一梭子机关枪和三枚手榴弹便把它打坏，倒在路边。但是里面的敌人还没有死光。车顶上的机关枪朝着游击队的阵地疯狂地扫射。战斗展开了。不一会，另外一辆装甲车也从后面开到，加入作战，结果也遭到与前一辆装甲车同样的命运。等到更多的装甲车到来增援的时候，游击队的战士早已离开那里好远了。这一仗粉碎了敌人以为装甲车就是“安全堡垒”的神话。
    十月三十日，游击队也打了类似的一仗。六小时内，游击队截住了各种车辆十辆。属于商人的，丝毫不动，让他们开走。英国殖民政府运树胶、石头等的货车，则予以烧毁，最后并俘虏了两辆运炸药的卡车，缴获了一些炸药和枪支弹药。
  三、击溃敌人一个分队
    游击队愈活跃，敌人的镇压就愈疯狂。他们不但把游击队活动区域中各乡村的人民抓光赶光，并且把各处的树木砍光烧光。他们以为这样就可以制游击队于死命。他们不知道游击队战士在任何艰苦的环境中一样可以生存，一样可以战斗。游击队某中队在南唛敌人砍得光秃秃的一个山头上，痛歼了马来兵团第二营第三连的一个分队。
    十月二十日的上午，游击队的战士在而连突至文打公路旁的一处高地上埋伏好了，等待出来搜索游击队的军车。快到正午时，果然有四辆卡车从文打方面驶来。当着后面两辆卡车到达的时候，游击队的战士便开始密集射击。这时候，前两辆已经越过了游击队的警戒线，车上的敌人下了车，还想折回来顽抗。但被游击队猛烈的火力所阻止，他们只好抱着一挺轻机枪，跑到公路旁另一个山头开起火来。后两辆车上的敌人挨了打，一部分狼狈地跳下车来，伏在车底开枪还击，另外一些，还留在车上以机枪还击。游击队的手榴弹给予敌人致命的打击，使残敌不得不使用烟幕弹和催泪弹，在烟雾中狼狈逃遁，而遗下二十多具尸体和四辆卡车的残骸。
  四、在战斗中成长
    游击队员们的战斗生活的确是万分艰苦的。他们必须对付敌人的“追剿”，并在适当的时机打击敌人。他们没有充足的粮食，他们的弹药和武器要从敌人身上取得。他们有时候只能煮点香蕉叶子充饥，弄到点米，也只能吃个半饱。但是，这些困难，丝毫没有影响到战士们的战斗意志，反而更增加他们对敌人的仇恨。
    群众对部队的热烈支持，加强了战士们胜利的信心。虽然英国殖民者施行着极端残酷的镇压，但是各地的老百姓都不顾一切地以全部力量来支援他们自己的军队。当他们一看见游击队到来的时候，就高兴地把埋藏在地底下的粮食拿出来，而且坚决不肯收钱。
    一个晴明的月夜，战士们正在整装待发，司令员以洪亮的声音向战士们说：“我们的斗争是艰苦的，我们有着许许多多的困难，但是我们有无数的群众支援我们，我们是一定能够克服困难，取得胜利的！”
    战士们怀着雄壮的心情，踏上征途，迎接新的战斗！
