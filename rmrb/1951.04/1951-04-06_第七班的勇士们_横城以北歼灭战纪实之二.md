　　The Warriors of the Seventh Platoon
　　——A True Record of the Annihilation Battle North of Hengcheng (Part 2)
　　By Our Correspondent Li Wen
　　In the annihilation battle north of Hengcheng, the nine soldiers of the Seventh Platoon, Third Squad, Third Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured sixteen American soldiers and eighteen Syngman Rhee puppet soldiers alive, killed one American officer, and killed or wounded eleven American and Rhee soldiers. The Seventh Platoon's record is glorious enough, but it cannot be said to be the most outstanding example in this campaign.
　　When the vanguard troops penetrated deep into the enemy's rear and the frontal assault troops captured the enemy's forward main position, the enemy troops who had advanced rashly to the Meihua Mountain, Wuyin Mountain, Guangtiantai, and Tanli areas were shaken across the board. Countless "sharp knives" of the Volunteer Army plunged fiercely into the enemy ranks, and countless arrowheads, large and small, pointed to the enemy from all directions…
　　The Seventh Platoon warriors walked at the very front of the entire company. They advanced to the foot of the mountain northwest of Guangtiantai, and it was already bright. After a full twelve hours of marching, chasing, and searching one mountain after another, everyone was very tired. Platoon Leader You Fenglin used all his strength to climb the mountain, panting. As he walked, he encouraged everyone, saying, "This is an important high ground related to the entire battalion. Arriving one minute earlier means achieving victory one minute earlier." Just as they climbed to the middle of the mountain, they vaguely saw figures flashing on the top of the mountain. Without hesitation, You Fenglin immediately ordered machine gunner Zhang Zhihong to quickly seize the mountain top and suppress the enemy with firepower. He also instructed soldiers Wang Engui and Huang Bingxiang to ascend the mountain from the right flank and outflank the enemy's retreat route. He himself led the other soldiers in a frontal assault. The fierce battle enthusiasm made the soldiers forget their fatigue. Zhang Zhihong took the machine gun from the ammunition bearer's shoulder, hung the gun belt around his neck, and rushed up the mountain peak while climbing and crawling. The machine gun roared, and eight bandit soldiers who were about to escape were pressed onto the hillside by a dense, rain-like net of fire, trembling close to the ground. The platoon leader came up, Wang Engui outflanked them, and the bandit soldiers hurriedly threw away the weapons in their hands and raised their hands high.
　　Five or six hundred meters away from this mountain, hundreds of enemy soldiers were retreating southward. At this time, the Seventh Platoon was already very far from the whole company. You Fenglin mobilized the soldiers: "The enemy has been shaken, and they can't figure out how many of us there are. As long as we charge and plunge fiercely, we can achieve even greater victories." The soldiers' answer was one voice: "Platoon leader, don't worry! We will fight wherever you point!" You Fenglin cast a kind and satisfied glance over all the comrades in the platoon, and then led the soldiers down the mountain (leaving one person to guard the prisoners).
　　Zhang Zhihong was quick-eyed, and he suddenly whispered, "Platoon leader, look to the right, the enemy is coming from the north again." The two enemy scouts in front passed by along the right hillside, but the warriors did not shoot. More than twenty enemies passed by, and the warriors still did not shoot. When You Fenglin saw more than a hundred American and Rhee bandits staggering over behind them, he issued the order: "Machine gun, fire hard!" Zhang Zhihong straightened his back and swept wildly with the machine gun. With the roar of the machine gun, Wang Engui and Huang Bingxiang used newly captured automatic rifles to continuously shoot at the enemy. The sudden attack made the retreating enemy even more chaotic. They screamed and fled in all directions. Some yelled and rolled down the hillside; some threw away their leather shoes and hurriedly climbed to the right mountain; some turned their heads and ran north. Their heavy machine guns were not set up and were left beside the mountain.
　　The Seventh Platoon warriors cut off the enemy's waist and chased fiercely from south to north along the hillside. Squad Deputy Dai Lihan advanced from the left and saw five Rhee puppet soldiers panting in front. They were staggering and could no longer run. Dai Lihan wanted to pounce on them and capture them alive. At this moment, dense carbine bullets suddenly flew from the side, and Dai Lihan quickly lay down. Zhang Zhihong, carrying his machine gun, arrived here and saw an American officer commanding several American and Rhee bandit soldiers, about to counterattack the deputy squad leader. Zhang Zhihong's heart flared up, and he fired three bursts of bullets at the American officer. The American officer fell down with a "wah" sound, his pistol thrown several feet away. Two American soldiers and three Rhee puppet soldiers were also killed. The three Rhee puppet soldiers who were not dead were about to escape, and Dai Lihan took the opportunity to jump up and capture them alive.
　　Another group of more than a dozen American and Rhee bandit soldiers hurriedly ran to a small house at the bottom of the mountain gully to hide. You Fenglin and Huang Bingxiang, one on the left and one on the right, followed closely and outflanked them. These dozen or so bandit soldiers were also all captured.
　　The sound of gunfire was very intense in the northern mountain pass. The American and Rhee bandit soldiers fleeing north were blocked by the Volunteer Army units coming from the northern mountain. You Fenglin led the entire platoon, following the hillside, and fought back from south to north again.
　　After crossing a mountain ridge, the soldiers saw five American devils spreading cloth panels to contact airplanes. Zhang Zhihong raised his gun to shoot, but You Fenglin quickly stopped him: "Don't be in a hurry to shoot, capture the foreign devils alive. Let the devils set up the cloth panels, and the enemy planes will be even more unable to distinguish the targets." Zhang Zhihong handed the machine gun to his assistant and, carrying a pistol (just captured from the American officer), quickly climbed up the mountain. The five devils discovered that a shiny black machine gun was aimed at them, and as soon as they turned their faces, Zhang Zhihong's pistol was already pointed at their chests. The five devils surrendered their guns in stunned silence.
　　Five more enemies were discovered running away, scaling a mountain. Turning the prisoners over to the platoon leader, Zhang Zhihong shouted as he gave chase. The last one running was an American devil; his hat was lost, his hair was disheveled, his face was bruised and swollen, and his bare feet were bloody. Zhang Zhihong chased to the front and gestured for him to surrender his gun. He sat down on his buttocks, threw down his gun, and raised both hands. Seeing the American soldier surrender first, the four Rhee puppet soldiers also dropped their weapons one after another.
　　At this time, the sound of gunfire rang out from all directions. The American and Rhee bandit soldiers fleeing south did not escape and were caught by the soldiers of the First Platoon and Second Platoon, who had thrust south from the left. The Eighth Platoon, fighting on the right side of the Seventh Platoon, also came over, escorting thirty prisoners.
　　When the battle ended, Zhang Zhihong held the American officer's pistol and escorted the captured American soldiers, his heart filled with the joy and pride of victory. He happily thought, "No wonder Chairman Mao said that American imperialism is a paper tiger; I truly understand it now. The United States has a lot of airplanes and cannons, but they can't match our high morale and good tactical command. American soldiers are trash, unwilling to risk their lives for Truman. Even with good guns and weapons, they are still our prisoners!"

　　第七班的勇士们
　  ——横城以北歼灭战纪实之二
    本报记者　力文
    在横城以北的歼灭战中，中国人民志愿军某部三连三排七班九个人，活捉美军十六名、李承晚伪军十八名，打死美国军官一名，打死打伤美李军十一名。七班的这个战绩够辉煌的了，但是，还不能说它是这次战役中最出色的战例。
    当尖刀部队插进敌军腹地、正面出击部队攻占敌军前沿主阵地的时候，冒进至梅花山、五音山、广田台、潭里一带的敌军，便全线动摇了。志愿军无数把大小“尖刀”猛插敌群，无数支大小箭头，从四面八方指向敌军……
    七班勇士走在全连的最前头。他们进至广田台西北山下时，天已经大亮了。整整十二小时的进军、追击，搜索了一个山头又一个山头，每个人都已经非常疲倦了。七班长尤凤林用尽全身气力，在气喘吁吁地爬山。他一面走着，一面鼓动大家说：“这是关系着全营的重要高地，早上去一分钟，就早得到胜利”。刚爬至山腰，隐约看见山顶上有人影闪动。尤凤林没有犹疑，立刻命令机枪射手张志洪迅速抢占山顶，用火力压住敌人；又让战士王恩贵、黄秉祥从右侧上山，迂回敌人退路；他自己带领其他战士，从正面冲击。炽烈的战斗热情，使战士们忘掉了疲劳。张志洪从弹药手肩上拿过机枪，把枪带往脖子上一挂，连攀带爬地冲上了山峰。机枪狂叫起来，八个正要逃跑的匪军被密雨似的火网压在山坡上，紧贴着地皮发抖。班长上来了，王恩贵包抄上来了，匪军们急忙仍掉手中的武器，高高地举起手来。
    距离这个山头五六百米远的地方，正有数百名敌军向南败退。这时，七班离开全连已经很远了。尤凤林向战士们进行动员：“敌人已动摇了，摸不清我们有多少人，只要我们猛冲猛插，便能取得更大的胜利。”战士们的回答是一个声音：“班长放心吧！你指到那里，我们打到那里！”尤凤林用亲切的满意的眼光巡视一下全班同志，便率领战士们冲下山去了（留下一人看俘虏）。
    张志洪眼快，他忽然低声喊道：“班长，往右看，敌人又从北面过来了。”走在前面的两个敌军尖兵顺着右侧山坡过去了，勇士们没有射击。二十多个敌人过去了，勇士们也没有射击。当着尤凤林看到后面的一百多美李匪军蹒跚地走过来的时候，才发出命令：“机枪，猛打！”张志洪直着腰，端平了机枪狂扫。随着机枪的吼叫，王恩贵、黄秉祥用新缴获的自动步枪，向敌人连续射击。突然的袭击，使败退的敌人更加混乱。他们惊叫着四散奔逃。有的叫着喊着滚下山坡；有的扔掉皮鞋，急忙爬向右面山头；有的回头往北飞跑，他们的重机枪没有架上，便仍在山旁了。
    七班勇士们拦腰切断敌人，顺着山坡，自南向北猛追。班副戴力汉从左侧前进，看见前面五个李伪军张着嘴喘气，他们一歪一扭，已经跑不动了。戴力汉想扑上去捉活的。这时候，密集的卡宾枪子弹突从侧面飞来，戴力汉迅速卧倒。张志洪端着机枪赶到这里，看见一个美国军官，指挥好几个美李匪军，正要反击副班长。张志洪心中火起，向着美国军官连打了三梭子弹。美国军官哇的一声栽倒了，手枪扔出几尺远，两个美国兵、三个李伪军也被击毙了。没死的三个李伪军正要逃跑，戴力汉乘机跃起，扑上去捉了活的。
    另一股十几个美李匪军，急忙跑到山沟下面的小房里去躲避；尤凤林、黄秉祥一左一右，跟着屁股包抄下去。这十几个匪军也全部俘虏了。
    北面山坳里，枪声响的很紧。这是北窜的美李匪军被来自北山的志愿军部队堵住了。尤凤林率领全班，顺着山坡，又从南而北地打回来。
    翻过一个山岗，战士们看见五个美国鬼子正在铺关联络飞机的布板。张志洪端起枪就要扫射，尤凤林连忙制止他：“不忙打，要捉活鬼子。让鬼子摆好布板，敌机更分不清目标了”。张志洪将机枪交给助手，提着手枪（刚缴自美国军官的），快步爬上山头。五个鬼子发现有一挺乌油油的机枪瞄着他们，刚一扭脸，张志洪的手枪已经对准他们胸膛。五个鬼子目瞪口呆地缴了枪。
    前面又发现五个敌人正在翻山逃跑。把俘虏交给班长，张志洪一面喊着一面追。跑在最后的是一个美国鬼子，他的帽子丢了，他的头发散乱着，他的脸跌得青一块紫一块，他的一双赤脚鲜血淋漓。张志洪追至跟前，比划着让他缴枪。他屁股一坐，扔下枪，两手举了起来。看着美国兵先缴了枪，四个李伪军也一个跟着一个地放下了武器。
    这时，四面八方都响起了枪声。南逃的美李匪军并没有跑掉，被自左侧南插的一排和二排的战士抓住了。战斗在七班右侧的八班，也押着三十个俘虏走过来。
    当战斗结束的时候，张志洪握着美国军官的手枪，押着被俘的美国兵，心中涌起胜利的愉快和自豪。他高兴地想着：“怪不得毛主席说，美帝国主义是纸老虎，我算是真明白了。美国的飞机大炮多，赶不上咱们的士气高，战术指挥好；美国兵草包，不愿为杜鲁门拚命，枪炮武器好，也一样当咱的俘虏啊！”
