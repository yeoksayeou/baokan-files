　　Waste of Transportation Capacity Should Be Avoided
Editor:
    A warehouse belonging to the Beijing Municipal Grain Company has repeatedly received grain cars from various places that are not loaded to their full tonnage, which is a waste of the nation's transportation capacity. For example, the corn transported from Guoqian Banner Station, Jilin Province, on March 25th, Car No. 15101, was short-loaded by 2,004 jin; the sorghum transported from Pingshan Station, Jilin, on March 15th, Car No. 55162, was short-loaded by 5,332 jin. Based on past experience, we have roughly calculated that each car is short-loaded by an average of 600 jin. We hope the transportation department will find ways to improve this situation.

　　应避免运输力量的浪费编辑同志：
    北京市粮食公司所属某仓库，屡次接到各地运来的未装足吨数的粮车，这是国家运输力量的浪费。如三月二十五日由吉林省郭前旗车站运来的玉米，第一五一○一号车皮就少装了二○○四斤；三月十五日由吉林平山车站运来的高粱，第五五一六二号车少装了五三三二斤。我们根据过去的情形，大致计算了一下，平均每车要少运六○○斤。这种情况，希运输部门设法改进。
