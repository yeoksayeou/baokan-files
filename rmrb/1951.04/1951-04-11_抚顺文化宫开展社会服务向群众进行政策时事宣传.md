To the Editor:
    In order to better serve workers and the general public, the Fushun Cultural Palace in Northeast China specially established a Social Service Department in May 1950, dedicated to answering questions and providing writing services for the masses. The Service Department strengthened its ties with the masses, especially in workers' residential areas, convened meetings with street residents' group leaders, and established certain working relationships with relevant administrative and cultural organs. It also publicized the working principles of the Social Service Department through local newspapers, radio stations, and its own wall newspapers. The work gradually unfolded and was very popular with the masses. They felt that the Social Service Department was like their own home, where they could say anything. Many women came to complain about their unreasonable marriages, asking comrades from the Service Department to help them resolve their problems.
    Since the Social Service Department began its work in August of last year, until the end of the year, it provided writing services and answered questions for the masses in a total of 2,095 cases. Among them, marriage problems accounted for 735 cases (mostly raised by women), current affairs and study problems accounted for 469 cases, and others involved workers' wages, land, housing, contract agreements, and other aspects. The Social Service Department also helped 66 unemployed workers find jobs. Through these efforts, we also conducted timely propaganda and education among the masses regarding policies and laws such as the Marriage Law, the Trade Union Law, the Land Reform Law, and the Regulations for Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries, as well as current affairs.

　　抚顺文化宫开展社会服务向群众进行政策时事宣传编辑同志：
    东北抚顺市文化宫为了更好地为工人及市民群众服务，在一九五○年五月特设立社会服务部，专门为群众解答问题和代笔。服务部加强与群众特别是工人住宅区的联系，召集街道居民组长座谈，和各有关行政及文化机关建立了一定的工作关系；又通过当地报纸，广播电台和自己出的墙报，宣传社会服务部的工作方针。工作逐渐展开，很受群众欢迎。他们认为社会服务部好像自己的家一样，可以有啥说啥。很多妇女跑来诉说她不合理的婚姻，要求服务部的同志帮助她解决。
    社会服务部自去年八月份展开工作以来，至年底，为群众代笔和解答问题共二千零九十五件。其中，婚姻问题占七百三十五件（提出的多是妇女），时事及学习问题四百六十九件，其他为工人工资、土地、房屋、合同契约等方面的问题。社会服务部并帮助六十六个失业工人找到了职业。我们通过这些工作，还向群众进行了关于婚姻法、工会法、土地改革法、惩治反革命条例等政策法令及时事的宣传教育。
