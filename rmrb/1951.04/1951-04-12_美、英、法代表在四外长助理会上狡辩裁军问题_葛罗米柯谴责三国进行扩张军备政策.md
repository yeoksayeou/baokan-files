Xinhua News Agency, April 9th Dispatch from Paris by TASS: The Four Foreign Ministers' Assistants Meeting continued on the 7th, chaired by the French representative, Mr. Baraduc.

The representatives of the three Western countries continued to oppose the wording of the first item on the agenda proposed by the Soviet Union on the 4th and defended their proposal of the 2nd. The British representative, Mr. Davies, spoke first, feigning "surprise" at the Soviet delegation's suspicion that the three Western countries did not want to implement genuine disarmament. While hypocritically assuring that the British government hoped to reduce military expenditures, he immediately admitted that the British government had been increasing expenditures to "restore armed forces." The American representative, Mr. Jessup, in his speech, continued to insist that the level of armaments should be the starting point for discussion and tried hard to prove that the United States was willing to follow the path of reducing armaments.

The Soviet representative, Mr. Gromyko, pointed out in his speech that the hypocritical assurances of Mr. Davies and Mr. Jessup that their governments were prepared to seriously consider the issue of disarmament were not in accordance with the facts. The negative attitude of the U.S. and British governments towards the Soviet Union's proposals for reducing armaments and troops was proof of this. In order to quibble, the representatives of the three countries deliberately issued the ridiculous argument of "doubting" the Soviet Union's intention to disarm. However, the best way to assess whether the Soviet Union truly advocates disarmament is through the Soviet proposals.

Gromyko reiterated that replacing the discussion of the four-power disarmament with general disarmament could only lead to fruitless empty talk. Gromyko pointed out that the Soviet proposal conformed to the requirements of consolidating peace, improving the situation in Europe, and improving the relations between the four countries, which were the general directions that should be determined in the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Therefore, the Soviet delegation insisted that this proposal, which was in accordance with the demands of the people, should be adopted.

Xinhua News Agency, April 11th Dispatch from Paris by TASS: The Four Foreign Ministers' Assistants Meeting held its twenty-sixth meeting on the 9th, chaired by the British representative, Mr. Davies.

The discussion focused on the draft of the first item on the agenda proposed by the Soviet delegation on the 4th. Even the reactionary French newspapers could not help but admit that this draft had opened the door to reaching an agreement. However, the speeches of the representatives of the three Western countries regarding the Soviet proposal showed that they continued to follow the policy that had been formed at the beginning of the meeting – opposing the discussion of the two major and fundamental issues of eliminating German militarism and reducing the troops of the four countries. They made cunning and empty arguments, attempting to confuse simple and clear questions. The speech of the French representative, Mr. Baraduc, revealed that the reason why the three Western countries opposed listing the issue of disarmament as the first issue was precisely because they were already engaged in an arms expansion movement. Mr. Baraduc openly stated: "We are already engaged in reorganizing armaments."

The Soviet representative, Mr. Gromyko, stated: The Soviet delegation believes that this issue must be discussed from the perspective of reducing armaments and troops. The main issue of reducing armaments and troops must not be submerged by the issue of the level of armaments and its supervision. However, the views of the three-country delegations are completely different. The three-country representatives, knowing that their arguments are untenable, insisted that the arms expansion movement they are carrying out is "forced." The purpose of this argument is nothing more than to deceive public opinion and cover up the true reasons for the Western countries to carry out unlimited arms expansion movements, rearm Germany, and revive German militarism. In the American newspapers, everywhere you can see open comments from arms dealers and the like: "Reducing armaments will cause major economic difficulties for the United States," which explains the truth of the matter.

Gromyko continued: We expose the aggressive policies of certain groups in certain countries, and some may say that this is "propaganda." However, if demanding disarmament, demanding the consolidation of peace, and demanding the improvement of relations between the four countries can be called propaganda, then this kind of propaganda is beneficial and should be carried out. But people must never engage in war propaganda, as is being carried out under the instructions of certain national governments. In the Soviet Union, there is only one voice – the voice of consolidating peace, reducing the troops of the four countries, and preventing the resurgence of German militarism. The Soviet people resolutely condemn the policy of expanding armaments, establishing West German troops, and launching another war implemented by the three Western countries. This is why the Soviet delegation insists on including the elimination of German militarism and the issue of four-power disarmament on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. We are convinced that doing so is in accordance with the interests of consolidating peace and in accordance with the fundamental national interests of all countries, including the United States, Britain, and France. We are willing to patiently revise the chapters, sections, individual words, and punctuation of the agenda, but we cannot agree to bury the major issue of disarmament in ambiguous wording.

Davies, Jessup, and Baraduc spoke in succession, repeating their untenable arguments. The meeting then adjourned.

### 美、英、法代表在四外长助理会上狡辩裁军问题  葛罗米柯谴责三国进行扩张军备政策

　　美、英、法代表在四外长助理会上狡辩裁军问题
    葛罗米柯谴责三国进行扩张军备政策
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：四国外长助理会议于七日继续举行，由法国代表巴罗第任主席。
    西方三国代表仍然反对苏联于四日提出的议程第一项的措辞，并为他们在二日提出的建议辩护。英国代表戴维斯首先发言，对苏联代表团怀疑西方三国是否想实行真正的裁军一点故作“惊异”，他一面虚伪地保证，英国政府期望减少军备开支，一面却立即承认，英国政府一直在增加开支以“恢复武装部队”。美国代表耶塞普在发言中继续强辩军备水平问题应作为讨论的起点，并竭力证明美国愿意遵循裁减军备的道路。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯发言指出：戴维斯和耶塞普关于他们的政府准备认真考虑裁军问题的虚伪保证是不符合事实的，美英两国政府对苏联裁减军备和军队的建议所采取的否定态度就是证明。为了进行诡辩，三国代表故意发出“怀疑”苏联裁军意向的荒谬可笑的论调。然而，考核苏联是否真正主张裁军的最好的方法，就是通过苏联的提案。
    葛罗米柯再次说明，以普遍裁军来代替四国裁军的讨论，只能流于毫无结果的空谈。葛罗米柯指出：苏联的建议符合于巩固和平、改善欧洲局势和四国关系的要求，而这些正是外长会议议程中应该确定的总的方向。因此，苏联代表团坚持应采纳这一符合于人民要求的建议。
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十日讯：四国外长助理会议于九日举行第二十六次会议，由英国代表戴维斯任主席。
    会议讨论集中在苏联代表团四日提出的议程第一项的草案。这个草案甚至反动的法国报纸都不能不承认已打开了获致协议的大门。然而西方三国代表关于苏联建议的发言，却表明了他们继续遵循在会议之初即已形成的方针——反对讨论肃清德国军国主义与裁减四国军队这两个主要和基本的问题。他们发表狡猾而空洞的论调，企图把简单明确的问题混淆起来。法国代表巴罗第的发言暴露了西方三国之所以反对把裁军问题列为第一个问题，正是因为它们已在进行扩张军备运动。法国代表巴罗第公然表示：“我们已在从事整顿军备”。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯发言称：苏联代表团认为必须从裁减军备与军队的观点出发去讨论这个问题，关于裁减军备与军队的主要问题决不能被军备水平及其监督的问题所淹没，但是三国代表团的看法却截然不同，三国代表明知他们的论据不堪一驳，因此硬说他们所进行的扩张军备运动是“被迫”采取的，这种论调的目的无非是为了欺蒙舆论，并掩盖西方国家进行无限制的扩张军备运动、重新武装德国和复活德国军国主义的真正原因。在美国的报刊上到处可以看到公开的军火商人一类的言论：“裁减军备会使美国发生重大的经济困难”，这就说明了问题的真相。
    葛罗米柯继续说：我们揭穿某些国家的某些集团的侵略政策，也许有人会说这是“宣传”，然而，如果说要求裁军，要求巩固和平与改善四国之间的关系可以叫做宣传的话，那末这种宣传是有好处的，是应当进行的。但是人们可绝不要去从事战争宣传，像在某些国家政府的指使下所进行的那样。在苏联只有一种呼声——巩固和平，裁减四国军队，防止德国军国主义再起的呼声。苏联人民坚决谴责西方三国所实施的扩张军备、建立西德军队和发动另一次战争的政策。这就是为什么苏联代表团坚持把肃清德国军国主义和四国裁军问题列入外长会议议程的原因。我们确信，这样做是符合巩固和平的利益，符合一切国家包括美英法三国的基本民族利益的。我们愿意耐心地校订议程的章、节、个别词句以及标点，但是不能同意把关于裁军的重大问题埋葬在含糊的措辞里。
    戴维斯、耶塞普与巴罗第相继发言重复他们不能成立的论据。随后会议即休会。
