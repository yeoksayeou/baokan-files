Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: European progressive newspapers have commented on MacArthur's dismissal, unanimously pointing out that this is the result of a serious defeat of the American aggressors in the Korean War and a victory for the world's people in their struggle against aggression and for peace.

    The French newspaper *L'Humanité*, in an editorial entitled "A Major Victory," stated: "First, the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers have placed the barbaric aggressors in a difficult position." "Second, the world's peace movement is so broad and fruitful that Truman has had to take it into account." In the above circumstances, "the contradictions between the imperialist aggressors have obviously deepened." These are the main reasons for MacArthur's dismissal.

    The British *Daily Worker* editorial stated: "The removal of MacArthur is a great victory for ordinary people who have recently declared their opposition to the imperialist madmen dragging them into a Third World War." The editorial called on "the British people to make the removal of MacArthur an opportunity to redouble their efforts to achieve peace in Korea."

    The Italian *l'Unità* pointed out: "This is a victory for the world peace movement." "Truman's decision shows that he can no longer stop the rising tide of protests from people in all countries." MacArthur's dismissal "is clear evidence that the struggle to defend peace can be victorious."

    The Czechoslovakian *Rudé právo*, in commenting on MacArthur's dismissal, reminded the people to be vigilant against the conspiracies of imperialism. The commentary pointed out: "MacArthur was merely an executor of Washington's orders from the beginning." "Not only the American government but also the governments of America's servant states knew about MacArthur's criminal plans, and these plans were also their plans." The commentary continued: MacArthur was removed "because he could not remain silent, because he incessantly leaked the plans of imperialism." "They removed MacArthur in order to continue implementing the policies that MacArthur had pursued, and in this way to deceive the people of all countries once again." The commentary concluded: "The removal of the commander-in-chief of the U.S. Far East Command is powerful evidence of the dilemma in the imperialist camp. Whether the policy of aggression is carried out by MacArthur or Ridgway, the outcome will only be a shameful collapse."

    The Romanian *Capital Life* commentary emphasized that MacArthur's dismissal demonstrates the failure of the imperialist camp's belligerent policy. The commentary pointed out: "The people of all countries know that the removal of MacArthur does not in the slightest mean that the American imperialists have abandoned their plans for slaughter. Therefore, the people of all countries will be more vigilant and more united in resolutely carrying out the struggle for peace until the conspiracies of the warmongers are completely shattered."

　　欧洲各国进步舆论
　  评麦克阿瑟被撤职
　  一致指出：这是美国侵略者在朝鲜战争中遭到严重失败的结果。
    【新华社十四日讯】欧洲各国进步报纸对麦克阿瑟被撤职一事发表评论，一致指出：这是美国侵略者在朝鲜战争中遭到严重失败的结果，是全世界人民反对侵略争取和平斗争的胜利。
    法国《人道报》在题为“一个重大的胜利”的社论中称：“首先，朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军已使野蛮的侵略者陷于困境”。“其次，全世界的和平运动是如此地波澜壮阔和获有成果，以致迫使杜鲁门不得不予以考虑”。在上述情况下，“各帝国主义侵略者之间的矛盾显然更为加深了”。这些就是麦克阿瑟被撤职的主要原因。
    英国《工人日报》社论说：“撤换麦克阿瑟一事是最近以来声言反对帝国主义疯子们把他们拖入第三次世界大战中的普通人民的一个伟大的胜利。”社论号召“英国人民应该使撤换麦克阿瑟一事成为重新努力以获致朝鲜和平的机会”。
    意大利《团结报》指出：“这是世界和平运动的一个胜利”。“杜鲁门的决定说明他再也阻止不住全世界各国日益高涨的人民的抗议了”。麦克阿瑟的撤职“是保卫和平的斗争能够胜利的明证”。
    捷克斯洛伐克《红色权利报》在评论麦克阿瑟被撤职一事时，提醒人民警惕帝国主义的阴谋。评论指出：“麦克阿瑟一开始就只是华盛顿命令的执行人。”“不仅美国政府而且美国的仆从国家的政府也都知道麦克阿瑟的罪恶计划，这些计划也就是它们的计划。”评论继称：麦克阿瑟之所以被撤换“是因为他不能保持缄默，因为他喋喋不休地泄漏了帝国主义的计划”。“他们撤换麦克阿瑟以便能继续实行麦克阿瑟曾经奉行的政策，并以此来再一次欺骗各国人民。”评论最后说：“撤换美国远东军总司令是帝国主义阵营进退两难的有力明证。侵略政策不管是由麦克阿瑟或李奇微来执行，其结局都只会是可耻的崩溃。”
    罗马尼亚“首都生活报”的评论强调称：麦克阿瑟撤职事件表明了帝国主义阵营好战政策的失败。评论指出：“各国人民知道，撤换麦克阿瑟丝毫也不意味着美国帝国主义者已放弃他们的屠杀计划。因此，各国人民将更加警觉和更加团结地坚决进行争取和平的斗争，直到完全粉碎战争贩子的阴谋为止。”
