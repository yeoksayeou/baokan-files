    Seed Loan Distribution Should Meet Farmers' Needs
    Letters of Self-Criticism from People's Banks of Qingyuan and Xiongxian Counties
To the Editors:
    The criticism in the "Letters from Readers" column of your newspaper on March 17th, "People's Bank Branches of Qingyuan and Other Counties Blindly Distribute Seeds, Not Meeting the Needs of the Masses," is correct. Because we did not conduct in-depth investigation and research before distributing seeds, blindness occurred. This is primarily reflected in the blindness of distribution. For example, the third district of Xiongxian County is mostly composed of severely affected villages, and the land was still filled with water last autumn. Without studying whether the district could be sown after the spring thaw, we subjectively assigned 90,000 jin of seed loans to the district. However, after the weather warmed and thawed, the land flooded again, and farmers could not sow even with seeds. Therefore, the bank only loaned out more than 20,000 jin of wheat seeds. The situation in Qingyuan County is similar. Secondly, it is reflected in the blindness of purchasing seeds. Before lending seeds, we did not know that some areas were not suitable for planting barley, so we blindly prepared all barley seeds. Because they did not meet the needs of the masses, we had to purchase broad bean seeds and lend them out separately. Regarding the price of wheat seeds, there was indeed a phenomenon of being higher than the market price at the time.
    In addition, the newspaper mentioned: "Because the Xiongxian County Bank did not mobilize the masses for democratic appraisal, the loan distribution was unfair, and many seeds were loaned to farmers who did not lack seeds, resulting in them being eaten or resold." This section is inconsistent with the facts. All the seeds we distributed this time have been democratically appraised by the masses, and because most of the seed loans are treated with medicine, the possibility of being eaten or resold is very small. Even if this phenomenon exists, it is individual.
    We sincerely accept the criticism from the People's Daily. In the future, we are determined to strengthen investigation and research work, so as to truly understand the needs of the masses and ensure that the loan price is not higher than the market price.

### 贷放种籽应切合农民需要  清苑、雄县人民银行来信检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    贷放种籽应切合农民需要
    清苑、雄县人民银行来信检讨编辑同志：
    三月十七日贵报“读者来信”栏所载“清苑等县人民银行支行盲目发放种籽不合群众需要”的批评是正确的。因为我们在发放种籽前没有进行深入调查研究，以致发生盲目现象。这首先表现在分配上的盲目性，如雄县三区多是重灾村，去年秋季地里还积满了水。我们没研究开春后该区能否播种，便主观地布置给该区九万斤贷种。但天暖解冻后，地里又出了水，农民虽有种籽亦无法播种，因此银行只贷出麦种二万余斤。清苑县的情况也是如此。其次表现购买种籽上的盲目性，我们在出贷种籽前，不知道有些地区不宜于种大麦，即盲目地完全准备了大麦种籽，因不合群众的需要，只好又购了菀豆种籽，另行贷放。关于麦种价格，当时确有高于市价的现象。
    此外，报上所提：“雄县银行因为没有发动群众民主评议，致使贷放不公，很多种籽贷给了不缺种籽的农户，结果被他们自己吃掉或转卖了。”这一节与事实有出入。我们这次发放的种籽，全部是经过群众民主评议的，并且因为贷种大部是药剂拌种，被吃掉与转卖的可能性很少，即使有这种现象，也是个别的。
    我们诚恳地接受人民日报的批评，今后决心加强调查研究工作，做到能切实了解群众的需要，保证出贷价格不高于市价。
        中国人民银行河北清苑、雄县支行
