Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 26th. The Shanghai China Blind People's Welfare Association has refused to accept a subsidy of 24,000 US dollars from the American "New York Association for Assisting Chinese Blind Children." In February of this year, Edgar Louis, the person in charge of the American "New York Association for Assisting Chinese Blind Children," wrote letters and sent telegrams to Fu Ruoyu, the general secretary of the China Blind People's Welfare Association, attempting to lure the association into continuing to accept subsidies from American imperialism. After receiving these letters and telegrams, the China Blind People's Welfare Association immediately reported to the Shanghai Branch of the China People's Relief Association. With the help of the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Association, all staff members saw through the imperialist plot and refused to accept this subsidy. The Shanghai Branch of the China People's Relief Association welcomed this decision of the association and, after understanding the specific circumstances of the association, allocated funds of 500 million RMB. Currently, all work of the association is proceeding as usual.

　  拒绝接受美国津贴
    【新华社上海二十六日电】上海中国盲民福利协会已拒绝接受美国“纽约援助中国盲童会”的津贴二万四千美元。今年二月间，美国“纽约援助中国盲童会”的负责人爱迪加·陆易曾写信和打电报给中国盲民福利协会总干事傅若愚，企图引诱该会仍接受美帝国主义的津贴。中国盲民福利协会接到这些函电以后，当即报告中国人民救济总会上海分会。该会全体人员在救济总会上海分会的帮助下，看清了帝国主义的阴谋，拒绝了接受这笔津贴。中国人民救济总会上海分会对于该会的这种决心表示欢迎，并在了解了该会的具体情况以后，拨予经费人民币五亿元。现该会一切工作均照常进行。
