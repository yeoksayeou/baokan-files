　　Northeast No. 7 Cement Plant Workers Report Overfulfillment of Last Year's Production Plan
    Northeast People's Government Chairman Gao Gang Sends Letter of Commendation
    Hoping They Will Continue Their Efforts, Learn from Soviet Experience, and Complete This Year's Task.
    On April 10th, Chairman Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government sent a letter to all employees of the No. 7 Cement Plant of the Construction Materials Industry Administration Bureau of the Northeast Industrial Department, commending the plant for overfulfilling its production plan last year under the close cooperation of the Party, government, and labor union. He also encouraged them to continue their efforts and strive to complete and exceed this year's production tasks. Chairman Gao Gang's letter is as follows:

    Comrades of all employees of the No. 7 Cement Plant:

    Your plant, as a result of the close cooperation of the Party, government, and labor union in leveraging the wisdom and initiative of the masses, achieved 171.7 percent of the planned production in 1950; improved quality by 24 percent; and reduced costs by 11.6 percent. These achievements are very valuable. It is hoped that you will continue to consolidate them, continue your efforts, learn from advanced Soviet experiences, and strive to complete and exceed the production tasks for 1951.

          With best regards,
              Gao Gang, April 10th

  Attached is a letter from all employees of the Northeast No. 7 Cement Plant to Chairman Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government.

    Dear Chairman Gao of the Northeast People's Government:

    Our No. 7 Cement Plant, thanks to the guidance of the Party, government, and labor union at higher levels, and the direct leadership of the former Far East Electric Power Company, and the fact that our plant, under the leadership of the Party and labor union, began organizing ten committees in the winter of 1948, greatly leveraging the organizational power of the masses.  We have regularly launched production emulation campaigns with focus and step-by-step approaches every month, quarter, and year, thus resulting in a steady rise in production performance over the years. For example, the output in 1949 increased by 88 percent compared to 1948; and the output in 1950 increased by another 77 percent compared to 1949. According to the annual settlement in 1950, the actual output exceeded the planned output by 71.7 percent; the quality improved by 24 percent, the cost reduced by 11.6 percent; the labor efficiency increased by 29.6 percent; and 269 new production records and rationalization proposals were created; breaking the unprecedented record of the No. 7 Cement Plant in more than 40 years.

    Comparing the number of employees and production time of our plant in 1950 with the highest production year during the Japanese occupation in 1929: the number of employees was 25 percent less, and the production hours were 16 percent shorter (the pre-burning area was still under construction in the first quarter); but the labor productivity still exceeded by 34.9 percent. According to the production situation in 1950, there cannot be significant changes in terms of output in 1951 due to the limitations of machine capacity, and there is no need for significant changes in terms of quality due to standard specifications. The area that requires the greatest change is in cost reduction. Therefore, in 1951, we will build on the existing piecework by shift in workshops and various quota-based management systems, and then focus on learning the "workshop economic accounting system" from the Soviet Union. We are now actively preparing everything to ensure the implementation of the workshop economic accounting system in March.

    At this time when the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism is expanding its war of aggression and undermining world peace, we are extremely indignant and firmly respond with practical actions to your call to "stand at the forefront of economic construction" and the major task of "consolidating national defense and developing the economy." We will further deepen the patriotic production emulation campaign of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and protecting our homes and country, strive to further increase output and quality, greatly reduce costs, and strive to accumulate more wealth for the country to the end! Finally, we wish you good health.

      Respectfully,
      All employees of the No. 7 Cement Plant,
      Construction Materials Industry Administration Bureau of the Northeast Industrial Department.
        March 1, 1951

　　东北第七水泥厂职工报告去年超额完成生产计划
    东北人民政府高岗主席复函嘉勉
    希望他们再接再厉，学习苏联经验，完成今年任务。
    东北人民政府高岗主席，于四月十日复函东北工业部建筑材料工业管理局第七水泥厂全体职工，对该厂在党、政、工的密切配合下，去年超额完成生产计划表示嘉奖，并勉励他们再接再厉为完成与超过今年的生产任务而奋斗。高岗主席的复函如下：第七水泥厂全体职工同志：
    你厂由于党、政、工的密切配合发挥群众智慧与积极性的结果，使一九五○年完成计划百分之一七一·七；质量提高百分之二四；成本降低百分之一一·六，这样的成绩是十分宝贵的，希望能继续巩固，并再接再厉，学习苏联先进经验，为完成与超过一九五一年生产任务而奋斗。
          此致敬礼
              高岗  四月十日
  附东北第七水泥厂全体员工写给高岗主席的信东北人民政府高主席：
    我们第七水泥厂，由于上级党、政府、工会的指导，和过去远东电业公司的直接领导，以及我们厂于一九四八年冬，党领导工会即开始组织了十个委员会，大大地发挥了群众性的组织力量。在每月、每季、每年都有重点地、有步骤地展开了经常性的生产竞赛运动，因而使历年来的生产成绩直线上升。如一九四九年的产量比一九四八年提高百分之八十八；一九五○年的产量又比一九四九年提高百分之七十七。根据一九五○年的全年结算，实际比计划产量超过百分之七十一点七；质量提高百分之二十四，成本降低百分之十一点六；劳动效率提高百分之二十九点六；并创出生产新纪录与合理化建议二百六十九件；打破了第七水泥厂四十余年来的空前纪录。
    我们厂以一九五○年的员工数及生产时间，要和一九二九年日寇时代生产量最高的一年相比较：员工少百分之二十五，生产工时短百分之十六（第一季前烧成场尚在修建中）；但劳动生产率还超过百分之三十四点九。根据一九五○年的生产情况，一九五一年在产量方面因为机器能力的限制，不可能有大的变化，质量方面因为有标准规格，也不需要有大的变化，所要求有极大变化的是在成本降低方面。因此，我们一九五一年要在现行的车间按班计件，与各种定额经营管理的基础上，进而有重点地向苏联学习“车间经济核算制”。现在积极做好一切准备工作，保证在三月份开始实行车间经济核算制。
    当此以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，扩大侵略战争，破坏世界和平之际，我们万分愤恨，坚决以实际行动响应您所指出的：“站在经济建设的最前面”的号召，与“巩固国防、发展经济”的重大任务，将抗美援朝、保家卫国的爱国主义生产竞赛运动再深入一步地开展起来，力求更加提高产量质量，大大降低成本，为国家积累更多的财富而奋斗到底！最后祝您身体健康
      东北工业部建筑材料工业管理局
            第七水泥厂全体员工敬上
        一九五一年三月一日
