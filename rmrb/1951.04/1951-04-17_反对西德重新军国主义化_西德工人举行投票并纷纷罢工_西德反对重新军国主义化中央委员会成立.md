　　Oppose West German Remilitarization
    West German Workers Hold Voting and Numerous Strikes
    Central Committee Against West German Remilitarization Established
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 15th] The decisions of the European Workers' Conference have aroused widespread response among West German workers.
    The German Workers' Committee Against Remilitarization has recently received more than 20,000 letters from various enterprises and mines in West Germany, expressing support for the various decisions of the European Workers' Conference regarding opposition to German remilitarization.
    In many enterprises, factories, and towns in West Germany, people's votes are being held one after another against remilitarization and demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty in 1951. In Hanau, Hesse (US occupied zone), 88 percent of leather workers, in Darmstadt, 95 percent of construction workers, in Ahrensburg, Schleswig-Holstein (British occupied zone), 80 percent of the people, and almost all residents of Rudelsheim in the Rhine region, voted against remilitarization.
    West German workers also held large-scale "lightning strikes." In North Rhine-Westphalia (British occupied zone), about 55,000 metalworkers went on strike for one hour on the 9th to protest remilitarization and low wages. Workers in Salgau, Württemberg-Baden (US occupied zone), also held a general strike to protest Adenauer's rearmament policy.
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 16th] According to a Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur (German News Agency) report from Essen: The Central Committee of the West German People Against Remilitarization was officially established on the 14th in Essen, the center of the Ruhr area. From now on, the struggle of the people throughout West Germany against American arming of West Germany will be carried out under the unified leadership of this committee. This committee was decided to be established at the First Congress of the West German People Against Remilitarization held in Essen on January 28 this year. The Essen Congress elected a preparatory committee which carried out long-term preparatory work for this. This time, representatives of people from all walks of life in West Germany gathered again in Essen to formally produce this central committee. The central committee has held its inaugural meeting and elected the presidium, responsible for leading the people throughout West Germany in carrying out the people's vote against remilitarization and preparing for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951.

    在西德许多企业、工厂和城镇中，已纷纷举行反对重新军国主义化和要求在一九五一年缔结和约的人民投票。黑森州（美占区）哈瑙城百分之八十八的皮革工人，达姆斯塔德城百分之九十五的建筑工人，石勒苏益格—荷尔斯泰因州（英占区）阿伦斯堡地方百分之八十的人民，莱因区卢德希姆地方差不多全体的居民，都投票反对重新军国主义化。
    西德工人还举行了规模巨大的“闪电罢工”。北莱因—威斯特伐利州（英占区）约五万五千金属工人于九日罢工一小时，抗议重新军国主义化和工资低微。瓦登堡—巴登州（美占区）萨尔高城的工人们也举行了总罢工，抗议阿登纳的重新武装政策。
    【新华社十六日讯】据德意志通讯社埃森消息：西德人民反对重新军国主义化中央委员会已于十四日在鲁尔区中心埃森正式成立，今后西德全境人民反对美国武装西德的斗争，将在这个委员会统一领导之下进行。这个委员会是今年一月二十八日在埃森举行的西德人民反对重新军国主义化第一届代表大会上决议成立的。埃森大会曾选出一个筹备委员会对此进行了长期的筹备工作。这一次，西德各界人民代表又在埃森集会，正式产生了这个中央委员会。中央委员会已举行了成立会议，并选出了主席团，负责领导西德全境人民进行反对重新军国主义化的人民投票和在一九五一年内缔结对德和约的筹备事宜。
