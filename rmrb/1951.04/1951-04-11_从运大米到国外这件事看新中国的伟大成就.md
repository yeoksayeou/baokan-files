Seeing the Great Achievements of New China from the Matter of Shipping Rice Abroad
To the Editors:
　　Upon seeing the news in the People's Daily that China is shipping 50,000 tons of rice to India, I deeply feel the greatness of New China!
　　Although China is an agricultural country, in the past, due to the exploitation and oppression of the reactionary ruling class, there was always insufficient food. Before liberation, large cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin had to eat American rice and Canadian flour. American imperialists used the guise of "relief" to invade China. At that time, the flour sacks and the signs of rice shops were marked in red letters to indicate that this was the "benevolence" given to us by the Americans. War criminal Wu Guozhen said at a meeting at Shanghai Jiaotong University against the US support of Japan: "You want to oppose the United States, do you know that the rice and flour you eat are given by the Americans? Are you afraid of being hungry?" Professors with integrity were filled with anger and returned the flour allocated by the puppet "Relief Administration."
　　Today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have stood up. We are no longer a humiliated nation. Hunger will never approach us again. According to Premier Zhou's report on National Day last year, in 1950 we produced 240 billion jin of raw grain, an average of 500 jin per person. Therefore, we not only have enough food, but also can ship our surplus grain to India when the Indian people are suffering from a severe famine. This is truly the greatest achievement of New China.
　　Acheson said in the White Paper that "China is a populous and impoverished nation, and no government can cope with hunger." Today's facts powerfully refute his shameless lies!
　　Our People's Government has only been established for a little over a year and has already done many things for the people; increased grain production is one of the most important achievements. Thanks to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we have such great achievements. I want to raise my arms and cheer, praising the greatness of New China and the great achievements of Chairman Mao!

### 从运大米到国外这件事看新中国的伟大成就

专栏：来信摘要

　　从运大米到国外这件事看新中国的伟大成就编辑同志：
    看到人民日报所载中国运五万吨大米到印度去的消息，我深深感到新中国的伟大！
    我们中国虽然是农业国；可是过去因为反动统治阶级的剥削压榨，粮食一向不足食用。解放前，上海、天津等大城市，还要吃美国米、加拿大面粉。美帝国主义者就假“救济”之名，来侵略中国。那时，在面粉袋和米店的招牌上，都用红字标明这是美国人送给我们的“恩惠”。战犯吴国桢在上海交通大学反对美国扶植日本大会上说道：“你们要反美，你们知道你们吃的米面都是美国人送的么？你们怕饿不？”有骨气的教授们听了气愤填膺，把伪“救济总署”配给的面粉退还了。
    今天，在毛主席的领导下，中国人民站起来了。我们不再是屈辱的民族。饥饿将永远不会挨近我们。根据周总理在去年国庆节报告一九五○年我们生产原粮二千四百亿斤，平均每人五百斤。所以，我们不但有足够的粮食，而且还能在印度人民正遭受严重粮荒之时，将我们多余的粮食运到印度去。这真是新中国最伟大的成就。
    艾奇逊在白皮书中说：“中国是人口众多而贫困的民族，任何政府面对着饥饿都没有办法。”今天的事实鲜明有力地驳斥了他的无耻谎言！
    我们人民政府成立不过一年多，已替人民作了许多事；粮食增产是最重要的成绩之一。感谢毛主席的英明领导，使我们有这样大的成就。我要振臂欢呼，歌颂新中国的伟大，歌颂毛主席的丰功伟绩！
