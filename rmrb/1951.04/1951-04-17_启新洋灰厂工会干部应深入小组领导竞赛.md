　　Since the Ma Hengchang Advanced Production Team issued a challenge for patriotic production competition to worker brothers nationwide, more than twenty production teams at Qixin Cement Plant (approximately two-tenths of the plant's production workforce) have answered the call. Since the movement began, although some initial achievements have been made, the competition has been difficult to advance steadily due to improper leadership methods by the trade union.

　　The competition started like this: the trade union notified the workshop committee by telephone to organize a response. The workshop committee then found the trade union group leader, and the trade union group leader called a meeting of members to write a letter of response. Before this, the trade union did not organize workers to seriously study and discuss the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang team. Only a few groups read aloud to the workers the materials about the Ma Hengchang team's production competition that were published in the newspaper. The two groups in the vise section of the East Repair Machine Plant responded to the challenge without even reading the newspaper. As for the conditions for responding to the challenge, most of them were written behind closed doors by the trade union group leader and the study cadre, etc., and then read out at the group meeting, which was considered passed by the whole group. As for why they should respond to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang team, what benefits would there be to responding, and how to respond, the trade union did not explain these issues clearly to the workers. Therefore, even now, many groups still do not know what the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang team is all about. How can such a competition be launched and sustained?!

　　After some groups responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang team and created some new production achievements, the trade union did not promptly commend and promote them. For example, the electrical team ensured safe power supply; all the workers in the metallurgy department improved tools and developed a chain model tire, increasing work efficiency more than six times; veteran worker Fan Shixun used his brain and improved the method of making cotter pins, increasing production from forty to more than four hundred per hour; since responding to the challenge, kiln workers in Plant C have increased production by twelve percent, and the workers are still considering establishing a contract. Because trade union cadres have never been to the workshop groups, they naturally lack specific understanding of these achievements and the ever-changing competition situation, let alone commendation and promotion. This has affected the competition enthusiasm of the workers who have made achievements.

　　In short, the production competition to respond to the Ma Hengchang Advanced Team has not been truly launched in our factory. Workers have responded by saying, "Not even a big-character poster is posted, it doesn't look like a response!"

　　Based on the above situation, we suggest that the trade union should strengthen its leadership over the competition, go deep into the groups, help the groups solve difficulties, do a good job in current affairs education and propaganda and mobilization for resisting America and aiding Korea, and formulate reward and inspection systems. Only in this way can the production competition be pushed to a climax.

### 启新洋灰厂工会干部应深入小组领导竞赛

　　启新洋灰厂工会干部应深入小组领导竞赛
    编辑同志：
    自马恒昌先进生产小组向全国工人兄弟提出爱国主义生产竞赛的挑战后，启新洋灰厂先后有二十多个生产小组（约占全厂生产人数的十分之二）应了战。从运动展开以来，虽初步取得了一些成绩，但由于工会领导方法不当，致使竞赛难以稳步前进。
    竞赛是这样开始的：工会用电话通知车间委员会说要组织应战。车间委员会就找工会小组长，工会小组长就召集会员开会写应战书。在这以前，工会没有组织工友认真学习和讨论马恒昌小组的先进生产经验。只有少数小组把报纸上登的关于马恒昌小组生产竞赛的材料向工人念了一遍。东修机厂虎钳部两个小组连报也没有念就应战了。至于应战的条件，多数是工会小组长和学习干事等几个人闷着头写出来的，然后再拿到小组会上一念，就算全体通过。至于究竟为啥要向马恒昌小组应战，应战有啥好处以及怎样应法，这些问题工会都没有向工人们解释清楚。所以一直到现在还有不少小组不知道马恒昌小组的先进生产经验到底是?回事。这样的竞赛，试问又怎能展开和坚持？！
    有些小组向马恒昌小组应战后，创造了些新的生产成绩，工会也没有及时加以表扬和推广。如：电务组保证了安全送电；冶工部全体工友改进工具，研究出练子模型胎，提高工作效率六倍以上；范士勋老工友开动了脑筋，改进了作销子的操作方法，每小时由四十个增产到四百多个；丙厂窑房自应战后，产量增加百分之十二，工友们还在酝酿订立联系合同。对于这些成绩和随时都在变化着的竞赛情况，因为工会干部根本就没到过车间小组，自然也就缺乏具体了解，更谈不到表扬与推广了。这就影响了创造成绩的工人的竞赛情绪。
    总之，向马恒昌先进小组应战的生产竞赛，在我们厂里是没有真正发动起来。工友们反应说：“连个大字报都不贴，不像个应战的样子呀！”
    根据以上情况，我们建议工会应加强对竞赛的领导，深入小组，帮助小组解决困难，做好抗美援朝的时事教育和宣传鼓动工作，并订出奖励和检查制度。这样才能把生产竞赛推向高潮。
