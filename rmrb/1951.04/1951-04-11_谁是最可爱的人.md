　　Who are the Most Lovable People?
　　Wei Wei
　　Every day in Korea, I am moved by something, and the tide of my thoughts and feelings is running wild. It makes me want to tell all my friends in the motherland. But what I am most anxious to tell you is an important experience in my thoughts and feelings, that is, I increasingly and deeply feel who are our most lovable people!
　　Who are our most lovable people? Our troops, our soldiers, I feel they are the most lovable people.
　　Perhaps some people are vaguely saying in their hearts: Are you talking about those "soldiers"? They seem very ordinary and simple. They don't seem to have any brilliant knowledge, nor do they seem to have rich and delicate emotions. But, I want to say, this is because you have too little contact with our soldiers, so you have not been able to understand: their qualities are so pure and noble, their will is so firm and strong, their temperament is so simple and humble, and their hearts are so beautiful and broad!
　　Let me tell you a story.
　　It was during the Second Battle. A volunteer army unit was rushing into the enemy's rear to cut off the enemy's escape route from Gunuri. When they arrived at Sudong Station, the escaping enemy happened to arrive there as well, and they were about to drive past on the highway. The vanguard company (Company Three) of this unit hurriedly occupied a very low, bare hill beside the highway to block the enemy, and a heroic battle began. In order to escape, the enemy used thirty-two aircraft, more than ten tanks, and group charges to surge towards the company's position. The entire hilltop was overturned. The flames of gasoline bombs burned the position red. But the warriors, on this hill of smoke and fire, shouted slogans and repeatedly beat the enemy to death in front of the position. The enemy's corpses piled up like grain in front of the hill, and blood stained the hill red. But the enemy still desperately tried to seize the position, so that their main force would not be annihilated. This fierce battle lasted for eight full hours. Finally, the warriors ran out of bullets. The swarming enemy occupied the hilltop and pushed them to the foot of the mountain. The gasoline bombs dropped by the aircraft set their bodies on fire. At this time, the warriors would still not retreat. They threw down their guns and rushed towards the enemy with flames roaring on their bodies and hats, hugging the enemy and using the fire on their bodies to burn to death the enemy who wanted to occupy the position. … According to the battalion commander of this battalion, after the battle, on the position of this company, the guns were completely smashed, and machine gun parts were scattered all over the mountain. The bodies of the martyrs were in various poses, some hugging the enemy's waist, some hugging the enemy's head, some holding the enemy's neck, pressing the enemy to the ground, and falling and burning together with the enemy. There was also a soldier who still tightly held a grenade in his hand, the grenade body was covered with brain matter, and the American devil who died with him had his brain splattered all over the ground. Another soldier had half of the enemy's ear in his mouth. When burying the bodies of the martyrs, because their hands were clasped so tightly, hugging the enemy so tightly that they could not be separated, some of their fingers were broken. … Although this company suffered heavy casualties, they killed more than 300 enemies, and in particular, enabled the main force of our troops to catch up and annihilate the enemy.
　　This is one of the most heroic battles on the Korean battlefield—the Battle of Songgok Peak, or the Battle of Sudong Station. If a monument needs to be erected, let me write down the names of the martyrs who charged the enemy with fire and fought to the death with the enemy with bayonets. Their names are: Wang Jinchuan, Xing Yutang, Hu Chuanjiu, Jing Yuzhuo, Wang Wenying, Xiong Guanquan, Wang Jinhou, Zhao Xijie, Sui Jinshan, Li Yuan, Ding Zhendai, Zhang Guisheng, Cui Yuliang, Li Shuguo. There is also a soldier whose name can no longer be known. Let our martyrs be immortal for all ages!
　　The battalion commander told me the above situation. His voice was slow, and his emotion was heavy. He said that he shed tears when he buried the martyrs on the position. But he then said: "Don't think I'm sad for them, I'm proud of them! I feel that our soldiers are too great, too lovable, I can't help but be moved to tears."
　　Friends, what are your thoughts when you hear this heroic story? Don't you think our soldiers are lovable? Don't you feel that our motherland is worthy of pride for having such heroes?
　　Our soldiers are so ruthless to the enemy, but so benevolent to the Korean people, full of profound internationalist enthusiasm.
　　On the north bank of the Han River, I met a young soldier, he is only twenty-one years old this year, named Ma Yuxiang, from Qinggang County, Heilongjiang. He has a slightly dark red face, a slightly taller stature, standing there, as simple and lovely as a red sorghum stalk in the autumn field. However, because he had just come down from the position, he looked a little tired. The red threads in his eyes had not yet faded. He was originally in the artillery company. One night, he was awakened by a cry. When he went out to take a look, it was an old Korean woman sitting on the hillside crying. It turned out that his house had been bombed, and he had built a shack in the mountains, but the shack had also been bombed. … Back, he immediately asked the company headquarters to go to the infantry company. Because the infantry company needed it, he was approved. I said, "Isn't it the same to fight the enemy in the artillery company?" "That's different!" he said, "The closer you are to the enemy, the more enjoyable it is to fight, the more you feel relieved!"
　　During the days and nights on the south bank of the Han River, one day he came down from the position to cook. As soon as he entered the village, several enemy planes attacked, fired a burst of machine gun fire, and then dropped two large incendiary bombs. Several houses caught fire, and the fire was so strong, and the smoke was so heavy that he dared not go near. At this time, he heard the crying of a child in the smoke and fire. He immediately went through the thick smoke to take a look, and a middle-aged Korean man was lying in the courtyard, and the child's crying was still in the house. He walked to the door, but the flames at the door were roaring and people could not enter, and the paper edges of the doors and windows were already burning. The child's crying came out with the thick smoke, very clearly. When he narrated this, he said: "Could I not go in? I can't! I thought, if I could go in if I encountered this situation in the motherland, then could I not go in in Korea? Aren't the Korean people the same as the people of our motherland? I kicked the door open with my foot and rushed in. Ah! The room was full of gray smoke, I could only hear the child crying, but I couldn't see anyone. My eyes couldn't open, and my face was as hot as being cut with a knife. I didn't know if I was on fire, I didn't care, I just groped around on the ground. First I touched an adult, pulled it but didn't move it, and then touched behind the adult, and then touched a child's leg. I grabbed it and jumped out. I saw the child, it was a very good child. He was wearing a small short shirt, bare two small legs, small legs jumping around, crying哇哇. I thought to myself: 'No matter if you cry or not, if I don't save your family, who will support you!' At this time, the fire was even bigger, and the paper on the walls was completely burned. I put him on the ground and went back through the fire door again. I pulled the adult, she hummed, and then didn't move. I took a closer look and saw that the blood on her face had stained her white clothes in front of her chest red, and her eyes were closed. I knew she was not going to make it, so I hurried out, put out the flames on my body, and picked up this child without parents. …"
　　Friends, what are your feelings when you hear this story? Don't you think our soldiers are the most lovable people?
　　Everyone knows that the Korean battlefield is a bit difficult. But what are they like? Once, I saw a soldier eating a mouthful of fried noodles and then a mouthful of snow in an air-raid shelter. I asked him: "Don't you feel bitter?" He took back the spoonful of snow he was about to send to his mouth, smiled, and said, "How can I not feel it! Our revolutionary army is not a monster! But our glory lies here." He simply put down the spoon and said excitedly: "Take eating snow as an example. I eat snow here, precisely so that the people of our motherland don't eat snow. They can sit in a bright room, brew a pot of tea, guard a small stove, and make whatever they want to eat." He pointed to the small and humid air-raid shelter and said: "Take squatting in the air-raid shelter as an example. It's so suffocating. Seeing the good sun outside, you can't walk on the bright road! But I squat in the air-raid shelter, so the people of the motherland don't have to squat in the air-raid shelter. They can walk slowly on the road. They can ride a bicycle, walk, stroll, and talk. How happy is that! So," he put the snow in his mouth again, as if summarizing, "It's nothing for me to shed a little blood here, what's it to suffer a little!" I asked again: "Do you miss the motherland?" He laughed: "Who doesn't miss it, it's a lie to say I don't. But I don't want to go back. If I go back, the people of the motherland will ask: 'How well did you complete the tasks entrusted to us?' How can I answer? I said 'Korea is half red and half black, what is that?'" I continued to ask: "You have experienced so many dangers, suffered so much hardship, what requirements do you have for the motherland and for Korea?" He thought for a while before answering me: "We don't want anything. But to tell the truth, what I'm going to say may not be appropriate. We want something this big," he smiled, using his fingers to compare to the size of a copper coin, afraid that I wouldn't understand, and said again: "A 'Korean Liberation Medal', we would like to wear it on our chest and return to our motherland."
　　Friends, without the need for tedious examples, you can already understand what kind of people our soldiers are. What kind of quality is this kind of person, how beautiful and broad their souls are. They are the first-class soldiers, the first-class people in history and in the world! They are the excellent flowers of all kind and peace-loving people in the world! They are the flowers of our proud motherland! We are proud of our motherland for having such heroes, and we are proud to be born in this heroic country!
　　Dear friends, when you get on the first streetcar in the morning and head to the factory, when you carry a plow and head to the fields, when you finish a cup of soybean milk and head to school with your schoolbag, when you sit quietly at your desk and plan the work for the day, when you stuff an apple into your child's mouth, when you take a leisurely walk with your lover, friends, do you realize that you are in happiness? You may look at me in surprise: "This is very ordinary!" However, people who have returned from Korea will know that you are living in happiness. Please realize that this is a kind of happiness, because only when you realize this can you more deeply understand the reason why our soldiers are fighting bravely in Korea. Friends! You already know how to love our motherland and love our leader, please deeply love our soldiers again, they are indeed our most lovable people!

### 谁是最可爱的人

　　谁是最可爱的人
    魏巍
    在朝鲜的每一天，我都被一些东西感动着，我的思想感情的潮水，在放纵奔流着。它使我想把一切东西，都告诉给我祖国的朋友们。但我最急于告诉你们的，是我思想感情的一段重要经历，这就是，我越来越深刻地感觉到谁是我们最可爱的人！
    谁是我们最可爱的人呢？我们的部队、我们的战士，我感觉他们是最可爱的人。
    也许有的人在心里隐隐约约地说：你说的就是那些“兵”吗？他们看来是很平凡，很简单的哩。既看不出他们有什么高明的知识，又看不出他们有丰盛细致的感情。可是，我要说，这是由于你跟我们的战士接触太少，因此，你没有能够了解到：他们的品质是那样的纯洁和高尚，他们的意志是那样的坚韧和刚强，他们的气质是那样的淳朴和谦逊，他们的胸怀是那样的美丽和宽广！
    让我还是来说一段故事吧。
    还是在二次战役的时候，有一支志愿军的部队向敌后猛插，去切断军隅里敌人的逃路。当他们赶到书堂站时，逃敌也恰恰赶到那里，眼看就要从汽车路上开过去。这支部队的先头连（三连）就匆匆占领了汽车路边一个很低的光光的小山岗，阻住敌人，一场壮烈的搏斗就开始了。敌人为了逃命，用三十二架飞机，十多辆坦克和集团冲锋向这个连的阵地汹涌卷来。整个山顶都被打翻了。汽油弹的火焰把这个阵地烧红了。但勇士们在这烟与火的山岗上，高喊着口号，一次又一次把敌人打死在阵地前面。敌人的死尸像谷个子似地在山前堆满了，血也把这山岗流红了。可是敌人还是要拼死争夺，好使自己的主力不致覆灭。这激战整整持续了八个小时，最后，勇士们的子弹打光了。蜂涌上来的敌人，占领了山头，把他们压到山脚。飞机掷下的汽油弹，把他们的身上烧着了火。这时候，勇士们是仍然不会后退的呀，他们把枪一摔，身上、帽子上冒着呜呜的火苗向敌人扑去，把敌人抱住，让身上的火，把要占领阵地的敌人烧死。……据这个营的营长告诉我，战后，这个连的阵地上，枪支完全摔碎了，机枪零件扔得满山都是。烈士们的尸体，做着各种各样的姿势，有抱住敌人腰的，有抱住敌人头的，有卡住敌人脖子，把敌人捺倒在地上的，和敌人倒在一起，烧在一起。还有一个战士，他手里还紧握着一个手榴弹，弹体上沾满脑浆，和他死在一起的美国鬼子，脑浆崩裂，涂了一地。另有一个战士，他的嘴里还衔着敌人的半块耳朵。在掩埋烈士们遗体的时候，由于他们两手扣着，把敌人抱得那样紧，分都分不开，以致把有的手指都折断了。……这个连虽然伤亡很大，但他们却打死了三百多敌人，特别是，使我们部队的主力赶上，聚歼了敌人。
    这就是朝鲜战场上一次最壮烈的战斗——松鼓峰战斗，或者叫书堂站战斗。假若需要立纪念碑的话，让我把带火扑敌及用刺刀和敌拼死在一起的烈士们的名字记下吧。他们的名字是：王金传、邢玉堂、胡传九、井玉琢、王文英、熊官全、王金侯、赵锡杰、隋金山、李玉安、丁振岱、张贵生、崔玉亮、李树国。还有一个战士已经不可能知道他的名字了。让我们的烈士们千载万世永垂不朽吧！
    这个营长向我说了以上的情形，他的声音是缓慢的，他的感情是沉重的。他说他在阵地上掩埋烈士的时候，他掉了眼泪。但他接着说：“你不要以为我是为他们而伤心，我是为他们而骄傲！我感觉我们的战士是太伟大了，太可爱了，我不能不被他们感动得掉下泪来。”
    朋友们，当你听到这段英雄事迹的时候，你的感想如何呢？你不觉得我们的战士是可爱的吗？你不觉得我们的祖国有着这样的英雄而值得自豪吗？
    我们的战士，对敌人这样狠，而对朝鲜人民却是那样的仁义，充满国际主义的深厚热情。
    在汉江北岸，我遇到一个青年战士，他今年才二十一岁，名叫马玉祥，是黑龙江青岗县人。他长着一幅微黑透红的脸膛，稍高的个儿，站在那儿，像秋天田野里一株红高粱那样的淳朴可爱。不过因为他才从阵地上下来，显得稍为疲劳些。眼里的红丝还没有退净。他原来是炮兵连的，在有一天夜里，他被一阵哭声惊醒了，出去一看，是一个朝鲜老妈妈，坐在山岗上哭。原来他的房子被炸毁了，又在山里搭了个窝棚，但窝棚又被炸毁了。……回来，他马上到连部要求到步兵连去，因为步兵连的需要，就批准了他。我说：“在炮兵连不是一样打敌人吗？”“那，不同！”他说：“离敌人越近，越觉着打得过瘾，越觉着打得解恨！”
    在汉江南岸的日日夜夜里，有一天他从阵地上下来做饭。刚一进村，有几架敌机袭过来，打了一阵机关炮，接着就扔下了两个大燃烧弹。有几间房子着火了，火又盛，烟又大，不敢到跟前去。这时，他听见烟火里有一个小孩子哇哇哭叫的声音。他马上穿过浓烟到近处一看，一个朝鲜的中年男人在院子里倒着，小孩子的哭声还在屋里。他走到屋门口，可是屋门口的火苗呼呼地已经进不去人，门窗的纸边已经烧着。小孩子的哭声随着那浓烟滚滚地传出来，听得真真切切。当他叙述到这里的时候，他说：“我能够不进去吗？我不能！我想，要在祖国遇见这种情形我能够进去，那么在朝鲜我就可以不进去吗？朝鲜人和我们祖国的人民不是一样的吗？我就用脚踹开门，扑了进去。呀！满屋子灰洞洞的烟，只能听见小孩哭，看不见人。我的眼也睁不开，脸烫的像刀割一般。我也不知道自己的身上着了火没有，我也不管它了，只是在地上乱摸。先一摸摸着一个大人，拉了拉没拉动，又向大人的身后摸，才摸着一个小孩腿，我就一把抓着抱起来跳出门去。我一看小孩子，是挺好的一个小孩子呀。他穿着个小短褂儿，光着两条小腿儿，小腿乱跳着，哇哇地哭。我心想：‘不管你哭不哭，不救活你家大人，谁养活你哩！’这时候，火更大了，墙上的纸也完全烧着了。我就把他往地上一放，就又从那火门里钻进去了。一拉那个大人，她哼了一声，再拉又不动了。凑近一看，见她脸上的血，已经把她胸前的白衣流红了，眼睛已经闭上。我知道她不行了，才赶忙跑出门外，扑灭身上的火苗，抱起这个无父无母的孩子。……”
    朋友，当你听到这段事迹的时候，你的感觉又是如何呢？你不觉得我们的战士是最可爱的人吗？
    谁都知道，朝鲜战场是艰苦些。但他们是怎样的呢？有一次，我见到一个战士，在防空洞里吃一口炒面，就一口雪。我问他：“你不觉得苦吗？”他把正送往嘴里的一勺雪收回来，笑了笑，说：“怎么能不觉得！咱们革命军队又不是个怪物！不过我们的光荣也就在这里。”他把小勺儿干脆放下，兴奋地说：“拿吃雪来说吧。我在这里吃雪，正是为了我们祖国的人民不吃雪。他们可以坐在挺豁亮的屋子里，泡上一壶茶，守住个小火炉子，想吃点什么，就做点什么。”他又指了指狭小潮湿的防空洞说：“你再比如蹲防空洞吧。多憋闷的慌哩。眼看着外面好好的太阳，光光的马路不能走！可是我在那里蹲防空洞，祖国的人民就可以不蹲防空洞呀。他们就可以在马路上不慌不忙地走呀。他们想骑车子也行，想走路也行，边遛跶，边说话也行。那是多么幸福的呢！所以，”他又把雪放到嘴里，像总结似地说：“我在这里流点血不算什么，吃点苦又算什么哩！”我又问：“你想不想祖国呀？”他笑起来：“谁不想哩，说不想那是假话。可是我不愿意回去。如果回去，祖国的老百姓问：‘我们托付给你们的任务完成得怎么样啦？’我怎么答对呢？我说‘朝鲜半边红，半边黑，这算什么话呢？’”我接着问：“你们经历了这么多危险，吃了这么多辛苦，你们对祖国，对朝鲜有什么要求吗？”他想了一下，才回答我：“我们什么也不要。可是说心里话，我这话可不定恰当呀。我们是想要这么大的一个东西，”他笑着，用手指比个铜子儿大小，怕我不明白，又说：“一块‘朝鲜解放纪念章’，我们愿意戴在胸脯上，回到咱们的祖国去。”
    朋友们，用不着繁琐的举例，你已经可以了解到我们的战士，是怎样的一种人。这种人是什么一种品质，他们的灵魂是多么的美丽和宽广。他们是历史上、世界上第一流的战士，第一流的人！他们是世界上一切善良爱好和平人民的优秀之花！是我们值得骄傲的祖国之花！我们以我们的祖国有这样的英雄而骄傲，我们以生在这个英雄的国度而自豪！
    亲爱的朋友们，当你坐上早晨第一列电车走向工厂的时候，当你扛上犁耙走向田野的时候，当你喝完一杯豆浆，提着书包走向学校的时候，当你安安静静坐到办公桌前计划这一天工作的时候，当你向孩子嘴里塞着苹果的时候，当你和爱人悠闲散步的时候，朋友，你是否意识到你是在幸福之中呢？你也许很惊讶地看我：“这是很平常的呀！”可是，从朝鲜归来的人，会知道你正生活在幸福中。请你们意识到这是一种幸福吧，因为只有你意识到这一点，你才能更深刻了解我们的战士在朝鲜奋不顾身的原因。朋友！你已经知道了爱我们的祖国，爱我们的领袖，请再深深地爱我们的战士吧，他们确实是我们最可爱的人！
