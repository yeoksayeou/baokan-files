Bristles

Bristles are one of China's main native products and occupy an important position in the world market. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the total world demand for bristles was about 6,000 metric tons, of which China supplied more than 75 percent. According to last year's export situation, China's supply of bristles in the international market is about close to 80 percent, which shows the large output.

Bristles are the long hairs growing on the back of pigs. The hair is hard, sharp, and elastic. It is not affected by humid air and is very tough and can withstand high heat. Because it has these characteristics, it has a wide range of uses and has become an indispensable important material in today's industry and national defense. The main use of bristles is to make various brushes, such as machine brushes, paint brushes, military gun brushes, and various household brushes. In addition, the thin fibers split from bristles can be woven with silk and wool into clothing materials and used to make silk fabrics, thimbles, and needles for leather sewing. Broken bristles mixed with cement and soil can strengthen the building's firmness or be used as fertilizer in agriculture.

The production area of ​​bristles in China is more common than other native products. Farmers raise pigs mainly to accumulate fertilizer. Because China has a large output of agricultural products and cheap feed, the pig raising business has become a very important side business in China's rural areas. The main producing areas and distribution markets of bristles are: in the Northeast, Jilin, Qiqihar, Ashihe, Kuanchengzi and other places are the most widely distributed, with Shenyang as the main distribution market. In the Southwest, black and white bristles are widely distributed. Sichuan Province is the largest bristle producing area in China, with production areas all over the province, with white bristles being the most famous, and Chongqing as the main distribution market. In the Central South region, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong and other provinces are all bristle producing areas, among which the Xiangjiang River Basin in Hunan is the most widely distributed. The whole region takes Wuhan, Changsha, Kaifeng, Nanchang, Guangzhou and other cities as the main distribution markets. In East China, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces are also widely distributed, with Qingdao, Jinan, Weixian, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Bengbu as the main distribution markets. In North China, bristle producing areas are also all over the region. The distribution markets include Baotou, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Tianjin, Beijing, Xugezhuang, Xinxiang, Taiyuan, and Shijiazhuang, with the three markets of Baoding, Xugezhuang, and Beijing having the largest amount of bristles. In addition, Yulin in Shaanxi Province and Lanzhou in Gansu Province in the Northwest are the main distribution markets for bristles.

The output and quality of bristles are seasonal and affected by the climate. Generally, the output of bristles is the largest and the quality is the best in winter, followed by spring and autumn, and the worst in summer. Among the bristles in China, the black bristles in the Northeast are the best, with large oil content, few impurities, and long size (average size is about four and a half inches). The bristles in North China are the second best, with an average size of about three and three-quarters inches. The quality of bristles in Central South and East China is also good, but the average size is shorter. In the Southwest, the white bristles in Sichuan are the best in quality and the largest in output. According to statistics published by the Puppet Central Agricultural Experiment Institute in 1946, Sichuan Province ranks first in the country, with an average annual output accounting for about 14 percent of the total national output before the War of Resistance Against Japan, followed by Hunan, accounting for about slightly less than 10 percent of the total national output, and then Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong, Hebei, Guangdong and other provinces. The total output in the Northeast region accounts for about 16 percent of the total national output. According to the "China Trade Yearbook" in 1948, the average annual total output of bristles in China from 1947 to 1949 was about 70,000 quintals.

Bristles are one of China's important export commodities. The export of bristles began in the Xianfeng period of the Qing Dynasty. During the Guangxu period, a large number of bristles were shipped to the United States and Japan. With the development of industry in capitalist countries, the demand for bristles in China is also increasingly urgent. In the past two or three decades, China's annual exports of bristles have been about 40,000 quintals. In the past, China's bristle exports were mostly manipulated by foreign merchants of British and American imperialism, and the price of bristles was also manipulated by foreign merchants of imperialism. Since the liberation of the whole country, the policy of state-owned trade for unified sales to foreign countries has been implemented, and the price has been freed from the manipulation of imperialism, and the stability of the bristle price has been strived for, and the quality has also been considerably improved. Therefore, the foreign sales in 1950 have been greatly developed. This has played a considerable role in promoting domestic and foreign exchanges, enlivening the urban and rural economy, improving farmers' lives, and increasing national tax revenue. For example, Hetou Town in Hebei Province has a population of 20,000. Last year, China Bristle Company invested more than 14.8 million catties of white corn in processing fees, which greatly improved the lives of local farmers. At the same time, it also increased the country's income. The tax revenue completed by Hetou Town alone is 50 percent more than that of Tangshan City. Taking Weixian County in Shandong as an example, a total of 10,000 boxes of bristles were purchased in 1950. Farmers in the county generally reflected that this was the best deal they had had in more than ten years. In 1950, state-owned bristle companies purchased a total of more than 10 million catties of bristles, breaking the purchase volume in the past 15 years. In the past year, due to the large number of entrustments of private merchants by state-owned bristle companies for purchase and processing, the private bristle industry has also been restored and developed.

At present, land reform has been basically completed in areas with more than half of the country's population, and rent reduction and deposit refund have also been carried out in areas where land reform has not yet been implemented. With the liberation of rural productive forces, agriculture will develop rapidly, and the pig raising industry will also develop accordingly. Therefore, how to do a good job in pig breeding, management, epidemic prevention, breeding and other work, so that pigs do not get sick or get less sick, has become one of the main tasks of rural sideline production in the future. If all localities can earnestly pay attention to this work, the output of bristles will also be greatly increased.

　　猪鬃
    关崇炘
    猪鬃为我国主要土产品之一，在世界市场上占有重要地位。抗战前世界需要猪鬃总量约为六千公吨，其中由我国供应的即占百分之七十五以上；按去年外销情况估计，我国猪鬃在国际市场上的供应量约近百分之八十，产量之多由此可见。
    猪鬃即猪背脊上所生的长毛，毛硬且尖锐，富有弹性，不受潮湿空气的影响，韧性很强，能耐高热。由于它具备这些特性，所以用途很广，成为今日工业上，国防上不可缺少的重要物资。猪鬃主要的用途是制造各种刷子。如机器用刷，油漆用刷，军用枪炮刷，以及各种家用刷等。此外猪鬃劈成的细长纤维还可与丝、毛合织成衣料，制造丝织品?头及皮工缝纫用的引针。残碎的猪鬃与洋灰泥土混合，能加强建筑物的坚固性，或在农业上用作肥料。
    猪鬃在我国的产区，比较其他土产品尤为普遍。农民养猪，主要的是为了积肥。由于我国农产品产量多，饲料贱，故养猪事业即成为我国农村很重要的一种副业。猪鬃的主要产区与集散市场是：在东北区以吉林、齐齐哈尔、阿什河、宽城子等地分布最多，以沈阳为主要的集散市场。西南区黑鬃、白鬃分布很广，四川省为我国最大的猪鬃产区，产地遍及全省，以白鬃最著名，重庆为主要集散市场。中南区的河南、湖南、湖北、江西、广东等省皆为猪鬃的产区，其中以湖南的湘江流域分布最多，全区以汉口、长沙、开封、南昌、广州等城市为主要集散市场。华东区山东、江苏、安徽、浙江、福建各省亦分布很多，以青岛、济南、潍县、上海、杭州、蚌埠为主要集散市场。华北区猪鬃产地亦遍及全区各地，集散市场有包头、张家口、保定、天津、北京、胥各庄、新乡、太原、石家庄等地，以保定、胥各庄、北京三市场的鬃量最多。此外西北区陕西省的榆林、甘肃省的兰州都是猪鬃主要的集散市场。
    猪鬃的产量与品质，是有季节性的，受着气候的影响。猪鬃一般冬季产量最多，品质最好，春秋两季次之，夏季最差。我国猪鬃品质以东北黑鬃最好，油性大，杂质少，尺寸长（平均尺寸在四寸半左右）；华北鬃次之，尺寸平均在三寸七五左右，中南、华东的品质亦好，但平均尺寸较短；西南以四川的白鬃品质最好，产量也多。我国猪鬃产量，以省来讲，据一九四六年伪中央农业实验所发表数字，四川为全国第一，抗战前平均年产量约占全国总产量百分之十四，次为湖南，约占全国总产量百分之十弱，再次为江苏、江西、山东、河北、广东等省，东北全区产量，约占全国总产量百分之十六。又据一九四八年中国贸易年鉴估计，我国猪鬃产量从一九四七年至一九四九年平均每年总计在七○、○○○公担左右。
    猪鬃为我国外销的重要物资之一。猪鬃外销始于满清咸丰年间。光绪年间运销美国及日本很多，随着资本主义国家工业的发达，对我国猪鬃需要亦日益迫切。近二、三十年来，我国猪鬃每年出口均在四万公担左右。过去我国猪鬃出口多操纵在英、美帝国主义的洋商手里，猪鬃价格亦为帝国主义的洋商所操纵。自全国解放后，实行国营贸易对外统销的政策，在价格上摆脱了帝国主义的操纵，争取了鬃价的稳定，品质也获得相当提高，因而一九五○年的外销有了很大的发展。这对促进内外交流，活跃城乡经济，改善农民生活，增加国家税收，都起了相当的作用。例如河北省河头镇，有两万人口，中国猪鬃公司去年即投放了加工费折合白玉米一、四八○多万斤，大大地改善了当地农民的生活；同时也增加了国家的收入，仅河头镇完成的税收较唐山市即多百分之五十。再以山东潍县为例，一九五○年共收购了一万箱猪鬃，该县农民普遍反映这是十几年来从未有过的好买卖。一九五○年全年国营猪鬃公司共收购了一千多万斤猪鬃，打破了近十五年来的收购数量。一年来，由于国营猪鬃公司大量委托私商收购与加工，亦使私营猪鬃业得到了恢复与发展。
    目前全国一半人口以上的地区已基本完成了土地改革，尚未实行土地改革的地区，亦进行了减租退押。随着农村生产力的解放，农业将会飞跃的发展，养猪业也将随之而发展。因之，如何作好猪的饲养、管理、防疫、育种等工作，使猪不生或少生疾病，即成为今后农村副业生产的主要任务之一。各地如能切实地很好地重视这一工作，猪鬃的产量亦将会大大增加。
