Sales situation of several bookstores in Beijing
　　Tao Huixin
    In order to generally understand the needs of readers for publications, I recently conducted a preliminary investigation into the book sales of the Xinhua, Sanlian, Lianying (from December last year to March this year), and Kaiming (March) bookstores in Beijing.
    The majority of readers read books to solve ideological problems and improve work methods. Therefore, the best-selling books are Chairman Mao's works, social sciences, current affairs, and related learning materials. These readers are mainly young students and on-the-job cadres. The most widely sold books are Chairman Mao's "On Practice," Kalinin's "On Communist Education," Stalin's "National Question and Leninism," as well as "Important Documents on Land Reform Compilation" (edited by People's Publishing House), "Textbook on the Constitution of the Communist Party of China," "Historical Materialism and the History of Social Development" (by Ai Siqi), "Today's India" (by Du De), "History of the New Democratic Revolution in China" (by Hu Hua), etc.
    Books on youth cultivation and some biographies are also very popular among readers. "Talking to Young Friends About Several Cultivation Issues" (by Ding Haochuan) and "Talking to Youth League Members About the Mass Line Problem" (by Deng Tuo et al.), published by China Youth Publishing House, and the biography "Marie Curie: A Brief Biography" published by World Knowledge Press, also sell extremely well.
    Publications on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea sold very well in December last year and January this year, but have decreased slightly recently, which shows that the content of these publications should be greatly improved. General content can no longer satisfy more readers. Books with real content are still bestsellers, such as "The Gold Circle Imperialism" (by Leontiev), "The Logic of 20th Century Barbarism" (by Meyer), "Post-War Soviet Union and the International Situation" (edited by People's Publishing House), etc.
    Due to the start of the spring semester, books on education sold a lot in February and March. For example, "Casual Talk on Chinese Teaching" published by Zhonghua Book Company, "World Education History," "Geography Teaching in Soviet Schools," "New Moral Education in the Soviet Union" published by Sanlian Bookstore, "New Education" published by People's Education Press, "Teaching Experience of Soviet Teachers" compiled by Educational Information Compilation Society, "Soviet Children's Education Full of Motivation" published by Zhonghua Book Company, "Extracurricular Activities in Soviet Secondary Schools" published by Dazhong Bookstore, etc., are very popular among readers.
    Books on economic construction also sell very well, especially those published by the Planning Committee of the Northeast People's Government are in short supply.
    In March, books on suppressing counter-revolutionaries also became the main target of readers' needs, but there are too few of this type of publication. Many readers also believe that there are too few publications on ethnic minorities, and some Soviet friends have also raised such opinions. There is also a lack of historical and geographical books.
    Generally speaking, study reference books and reference books are very much needed by readers, but the existing publications in this area are not satisfactory in terms of quality.
    There are also a certain number of readers for natural science and applied technology books, but they cannot meet the needs in terms of quality and quantity.
    Comic strips and popular reading materials also sell well. These are suitable for soldiers, children, and ordinary citizens with low education levels to read. A lot are bought by the military and reading rooms.
    Literary books generally do not sell much, but particularly good translations and creations still sell very well, such as "How the Steel Was Tempered," "Days and Nights," "Leadership," "Report When the Noose Was Around the Neck," "Celebrating the New Year" (by Lao She), as well as some books in "People's Literature Series" and "October Literary Series," have a certain number of sales. Publications that popularize foreign literary classics are very popular among readers with general secondary school level. A set of popular Soviet literary classics published by Kaiming Bookstore was quickly sold out.
    Some books do not sell much at present, such as more specialized publications on Soviet economic construction and more profound Marxist-Leninist classics. It is strange that women's books sell very little, which is worth studying.

　　北京几家书店门市销售情况
　　陶慧因
    为了一般地了解读者对出版物的需要，笔者最近曾初步调查了北京新华、三联、联营（由去年十二月至今年三月）及开明（三月）四家书店门市部的书籍销售情况。
    大多数读者读书的目的是为了解决思想问题，改进工作方法，因此最好销的读物是毛主席著作，社会科学、时事及有关学习的书籍。这些读者，主要是青年学生和在职干部。销行最广的是毛主席的“实践论”，加里宁的《论共产主义教育》，斯大林的《民族问题与列宁主义》，以及《土地改革重要文献汇集》（人民出版社编），《中国共产党党章教材》，《历史唯物论与社会发展史》（艾思奇著），《今日印度》（杜德著）《中国新民主主义革命史》（胡华著）等。
    青年修养和一些传记书籍，也很受读者欢迎。青年出版社出版的《和青年朋友谈几个修养问题》（丁浩川著）《和青年团员谈谈群众路线问题》（邓拓等著），世界知识社出的传记书《伊里奥·居里传略》等书，也销行极好。
    抗美援朝读物在去年十二月和今年一月，销行极畅，最近略为减少了，这说明这方面读物的内容还应该大大改进，一般性的东西，已经不能满足更多的读者了。真正有内容的书籍，仍然是畅销的，如《金圆帝国主义》（列昂节夫著），《二十世纪野蛮主义的逻辑》（麦耶尔著），《战后苏联与国际形势》（人民出版社编）等。
    由于正值学校春季始业，有关教育的书籍，在二月和三月份，销行甚多。如中华书局出的《漫谈国文教学》，三联书店出的《世界教育史》、《苏联学校的地理教学》、《苏联新道德教育》，人民教育出版社出的《新教育学》，教育资料丛刊社编的《苏联教师的教学经验》，中华书局出的《充满动力的苏联儿童教育》，大众书店出的《苏联中等学校的课外工作》等书，都很受读者欢迎。
    有关经济建设的书籍销路也极好，东北人民政府计划委员会出的这类书尤其供不应求。
    在三月份，有关镇压反革命的书籍也成为读者需要的主要目标，但这一类读物太少。许多读者还认为有关少数民族的出版物太少，有些苏联朋友也提出这样的意见。史地书也很感缺少。
    一般说来，学习参考用书、工具书都很为读者需要，但这方面的现有出版物，在质量上都还不能令人满意。
    自然科学和应用技术的书，也有一定的读者，在质和量上都还不能满足需要。
    连环画和通俗读物也是很好销的，这适合部队战士、儿童和一般文化程度低的市民阅读，部队和阅览室买的很多。
    文艺书籍一般销得不多，但特别好的翻译和创作仍很好销，如“钢铁是怎样炼成的”，“日日夜夜”，“领导”，“绞索套着脖子时的报告”，“过新年”（老舍著），以及“人民文艺丛书”、“十月文丛”中的一些书，都有一定销数。把外国文学名著加以通俗化的出版物，很受一般中学水平读者的欢迎，开明书店出的一套苏联文学名著通俗本，很快就销完了。
    有些书的在目前的销路还不很多，如比较专门化的苏联经济建设的出版物和比较艰深的马克思列宁主义古典著作。很奇怪的是妇女读物销行很少，这是值得研究的。
