Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th—To resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities, safeguard the lives and property of the people, and rescue the masses who had been deceived into joining the sect, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, after meticulous investigation, recently smashed the entire Yiguandao organization in Tianjin, which had continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities after being banned. A group of unrepentant reactionary leaders headed by Wang Yi were arrested, and a large number of reactionary propaganda materials, oracular pronouncements, and gold, silver, antiques, jade articles, etc., swindled from the sect members were seized.

　　Since the Tianjin Municipal Military Control Commission explicitly banned “Yiguandao,” Wang Yi, the “Qianren” (Front Man) and the overall leader of “Yiguandao” in Tianjin, fled to Shanghai, secretly directing his trusted followers within the sect, including key figures such as Bao Hongzhen, Liu Bingxian, Shao Bailu, Xu Ziyi, Li Dongchen, and Che Daquan, to actively restore the organization in Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an, Baotou, and other places. Later, Wang Yi secretly returned to Beijing, directing the "Yiguandao" in Northeast and North China to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. In the spring of 1950, Wang Yi and others used the "Lian Yuan" (Joint Vow) method to contact the sect members who had registered with the People's Government at each level, in order to rejoin the sect. The so-called "Lian Yuan" required the registered sect members to express "repentance." They also used the so-called "Dan Xing Fa" (Separate Action Method) to conduct secret liaison, and spread rumors to incite sect members to carry out sabotage activities.

　　After the Tianjin Public Security Bureau arrested this group of “Yiguandao” ringleaders and announced their reactionary crimes, many sect members have recognized the ugly face and reactionary nature of the secret society. According to incomplete statistics, in the past two days, 750 people have voluntarily declared their withdrawal from the sect to the public security bureau police stations.

　　In order to conduct this work in an organized manner, all districts have established withdrawal work organizations, and registration groups have been set up within the public security sub-bureaus. All districts in the city have launched extensive publicity campaigns based on police stations. Some districts have also convened meetings of household representatives and held rallies to denounce the crimes of "Yiguandao." The Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions has also issued an open letter to workers and staff throughout the city, calling on all employees to mobilize the broad masses to expose the crimes of reactionary secret societies and to carry out anti-sect and withdrawal movements.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th—After the government suppressed a group of special agents lurking in factories, the morale of Tianjin's workers has greatly increased, and they are now separately formulating patriotic covenants and continuing to launch anti-spy and anti-special agent movements. In the past, special agents used various means to carry out sabotage activities in factories. Wen Shaozeng and two other special agents in the iron extraction section of the steel rolling department of the Tianjin Railway Bureau's steel fittings factory deliberately sawed off the screw buckles of the iron extraction machine slightly damaged by wear, deliberately wasting materials. When the factory launched a patriotic labor emulation campaign, they threatened the workers, saying: "Our machines are too old, be careful of accidents!" to obstruct the development of the competition. Wang Yongtai, the foreman of the surface group of the shoe-making department of a certain leather factory, not only often attacked advanced elements among the workers and undermined worker unity, but also often dismantled the complete machines under the pretext of repairing them, deliberately discarding parts, which greatly damaged production. Several factories under the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Industry also frequently had accidents in the past due to the sabotage of special agents.

　　After the arrest of the special agents lurking in various factories this time, the production enthusiasm of the vast number of workers has been extremely high. For example, after Wen Shaozeng was arrested and handed over to the People's Court, the workers in the steel rolling department of the Tianjin Railway Bureau's steel fittings factory launched a campaign to challenge the Ma Hengchang group. Now, the daily output of both Class A and Class B has exceeded the original standard by 62 percent, and the quality pass rate of Class B has reached 99.6 percent (the standard is 95 percent). From February 13 to the beginning of April, no accidents have occurred in the steel rolling department. Nineteen groups in a certain leather factory have formulated patriotic covenants. Since April, more than 40 factories under the Municipal Bureau of Industry have widely launched mass safety movements, and are now establishing security and confidentiality systems, inspecting housing, machinery and equipment, and further developing safety responsibility systems. Workers at the Zhonghua Match Factory voluntarily organized a picket team to patrol and protect the factory during holidays.

　　天津破获一贯道全部反动组织
　　逮捕王义等一批怙恶不悛的反动道首
　　该市职工在镇压反革命后生产情绪高涨
    【新华社天津十日电】天津市人民政府公安局为坚决镇压反革命活动，保障人民生命财产的安全及挽救被骗入道的群众，经缜密调查，于近日破获了业经取缔后仍然进行反革命活动的一贯道全部组织，并逮捕了一批以王义为首的怙恶不悛的反动道首，抄获大批反动宣传品、乩语及由道徒手中诈骗而来的金、银、古玩玉器等。
    自天津市军事管制委员会明令取缔“一贯道”后，“一贯道”在天津的总头目“前人”王义即潜逃上海，秘密指挥其道内亲信鲍鸿桢、刘炳贤、邵百禄、徐子义、李栋臣、车大权等首要分子，在北京、天津及西安、包头等地积极恢复组织，后王义潜返北京，指挥东北、华北的“一贯道”进行反革命活动。一九五○年春季，王义等以“联愿”方式逐级联络已向人民政府登记的道徒重新入道。所谓“联愿”就是要已登记的道徒们表示“忏悔”。他们又以所谓“单行法”进行秘密联络，并大肆造谣，煽动道徒进行破坏活动。
    天津市公安局逮捕了这一批“一贯道”首恶罪犯并公布其反动罪行以后，已有不少道徒认清了会道门的丑恶面目与反动本质。两日来，据不完全统计，自动向公安局派出所声明退道者，已有七百五十人。
    各区为了有组织地进行这一工作，均已成立了退道工作机构，并在公安分局内设立了登记组。全市各区均以派出所为单位普遍展开了宣传，有的区还召开了户政代表会议和举行了控诉“一贯道”罪行大会。天津市总工会并发表了一封给全市工人、职员的公开信，号召全市职工发动广大群众揭发反动会道门的罪行，开展反道、退道运动。
    【新华社天津十日电】天津市职工在政府镇压了一批潜伏在工厂中的特务分子后，人心大快，生产情绪高涨，现正分别订立爱国公约、继续展开防奸细反特务运动。过去，特务分子采取各种方式在工厂中进行破坏活动。天津铁路局钢铁配件厂轧钢部拔铁工特务分子闻绍曾等三人曾在拔铁机的丝杠扣稍有磨损时，即将其锯掉，故意浪费材料。当该厂展开爱国主义劳动竞赛时，他们就恐吓工人说：“咱们的机器可太老，当心出事故！”以阻挠竞赛的开展。某制革厂制鞋部作面组工长特务分子王永泰，不仅经常打击工人中的先进分子，破坏工人团结，而且常常借口修理机器，把完整的机器拆散，故意抛失零件，使生产受到很大损失。天津市工业局所属若干厂，过去也因特务分子的破坏而时常发生事故。
    此次各厂潜伏的特务分子被逮捕后，广大职工的生产热情极为高涨。例如闻绍曾被逮捕送交人民法院后，天津铁路局钢铁配件厂轧钢部工人即开展了向马恒昌小组应战的运动。现甲、乙两班日产量均超过原定标准百分之六十二，乙班质量合格率高达百分之九十九点六（标准为百分之九十五），自二月十三日至四月初止，轧钢部就未再发生事故。某制革厂已有十九个小组订出了爱国公约。市工业局所属四十余厂自四月份起广泛展开群众性的安全运动，现正建立保卫、保密制度，检查房屋机器设备，并进一步制订安全责任制。中华火柴厂工人自动组织了纠察队，在假日担任巡逻护厂工作。
