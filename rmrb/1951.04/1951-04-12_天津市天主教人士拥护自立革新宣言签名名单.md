To Catholic friends across the country:

　　For nearly a century, the disaster-ridden Chinese nation has been the prey of imperialist aggression, and Catholicism has been used by imperialism as a tool of aggression. How many times in history have imperialist wars of aggression against China been launched under the pretext of religious cases? A series of unequal treaties explicitly stipulated "the privilege of preaching in China," the purpose of which was to use the church as a tool for their aggression. Imperialists, using the privilege of freedom to preach in China, caused churches scattered throughout the country to resemble concessions. Imperialists, with their hypocritical and benevolent faces, concealed their actual aggression, distorted the truth of God to fool and麻痹 the Chinese people; at the same time, they used churches, hospitals, schools, and other charitable undertakings as shields to buy over and co-opt backward elements, carrying out espionage activities. The espionage cases in Xianxian, Shenyang, Qiqihar, Jiaozuo, and Shijiazhuang are all undeniable facts. Now that the entire Chinese people have stood up, we also clearly recognize that the church, which has been used by imperialism, not only hinders China from moving towards independence, freedom, democracy, peace, unity, prosperity, and strength, but also, in fact, gives the greatest shame to God. They are precisely the Pharisees responsible to our Lord Jesus. We, the Catholic friends who are devout and respectful to God, are brave soldiers of Jesus, and we must restore the spirit of our Lord Jesus against the Pharisees. We have the courage and the duty to resolutely wash away the shame that the Pharisees have given to God, stand firmly on the position of the Chinese people, support the Common Program, oppose imperialism, completely sever all ties with imperialism, and implement the方針 of Chinese Catholic autonomy, self-support, and self-propagation. We now specially establish the Tianjin Catholic Renovation Movement Promotion Association, and we are willing to unite with Catholic friends, priests, and bishops in Tianjin and across the country to jointly strive for the bright future of Catholic self-reliance and renovation.
　
　　Catholic friends in Tianjin and other places, we are patriotic Catholics. We cannot tolerate imperialists using Catholicism to carry out their treacherous activities of aggression against our country. We must enthusiastically participate in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. We must recognize that is the truth of God, expose the elements who have served imperialism in the past, and thoroughly eliminate the influence of imperialism. We enthusiastically support and respond to the call of the clergy and faithful in Guangyuan, Chongqing, Suiyuan, Nanchang, Wuhan, Jiajiang, Yuechi and other places in Sichuan, and strive for self-reliance and renovation in the short term.

　　天津市天主教人士拥护自立革新宣言签名名单全国各地天主教教友们：
    灾难深重的中华民族，近百年来为各帝国主义侵略的俎上肉，而天主教亦被帝国主义利用为侵略工具。历史上有多少次帝国主义侵华战争是以教案为借口而发动的。一连串的不平等条约里，都明文载定“在华传教特权”，目的就是借教会作为他们侵略工具。帝国主义者利用在华传教自由特权，致使散布在全国的教堂形同租界。帝国主义者以其虚伪的仁慈面目，掩饰其侵略实际，歪曲了天主的真理，来愚弄与麻醉中国人民；同时利用教会、医院、学校等慈善事业为护符，以小恩、小惠收买与拢络落後分子，进行间谍活动。如献县、沈阳、齐齐哈尔、焦作、石家庄间谍案，都是无可置辩的事实。现在全中国人民已经站起来了，我们也明确认识了受帝国主义所利用的教会，不但阻碍了我们中国走向独立、自由、民主、和平、统一、富强的道路，而且事实上是给了天主最大的耻辱。他们正是吾主耶稣所负责的法利赛人，我们热心恭敬天主的教友们，我们是耶稣的勇兵，要恢复吾主耶稣反对法利赛人的精神。我们有勇气、也有本份坚决洗掉法利赛人给予天主的耻辱，站稳中国人民的立场拥护共同纲领，反对帝国主义，彻底割断与帝国主义各方面的联系，实行中国天主教自治、自养、自传的方针，我们今特成立天津市天主教革新运动促进会，愿和天津及全国教友、神父、主教们团结一致，共同为天主教自立革新的光明前途而奋斗。
   天津及各地教友们，我们是热爱祖国的天主教徒，我们不能容忍帝国主义者利用天主教来进行侵略我国的险谋活动，我们要热烈的参加抗美援朝保家卫国运动，我们要认清那是天主的道理，揭露历来为帝国主义服务的分子，彻底肃清帝国主义的影响，我们热烈的拥护与响应四川广元、重庆、绥远、南昌、武汉、夹江、岳池等地神长及教友们的号召，力求短期内自立革新。
