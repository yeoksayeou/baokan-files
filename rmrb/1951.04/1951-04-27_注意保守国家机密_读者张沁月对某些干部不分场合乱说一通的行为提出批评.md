　　Pay Attention to Guarding State Secrets
    Reader Zhang Qinyue Criticizes Some Cadres for Speaking Carelessly Without Regard to the Occasion

To the Editor:

    On April 15th, in Beijing, I took a public bus to Qianmen. I heard a comrade who works in the Ministry of Railways, sitting next to me, talking to three comrades about the situation of their work in their organization. They carelessly talked about matters related to state secrets. At that time, I suggested to him: "There are many kinds of people here. Comrade, you must be vigilant." Only then did they stop talking.

    I believe that this kind of action of speaking carelessly without regard to the occasion or the audience is a concrete manifestation of ideological paralysis and low political vigilance. This will expose state secrets and cause losses to the work. There is such a lesson in the movie "The Invisible Front." I specifically raise this matter again, hoping everyone will pay attention.

### 注意保守国家机密  读者张沁月对某些干部不分场合乱说一通的行为提出批评

　　注意保守国家机密
    读者张沁月对某些干部不分场合乱说一通的行为提出批评编辑同志：
    四月十五日，在北京市我乘公共汽车到前门去。我听到旁边坐的一位在铁道部工作的同志与同行的三个同志谈他们机关工作的情形。他们把有关国家机密的事也毫不在意地谈出来了。当时我就向他提出：“这里人很复杂。同志，要提高警惕性。”他们才不谈了。
    我认为：这种不分场合、不看对象乱说一通的行动是思想麻痹、政治警觉性不高的具体表现。这会暴露国家机密，使工作遭受到损失。在电影《无形的战线》中，就有这样的教训。我特别再提出这件事，希望大家注意。
