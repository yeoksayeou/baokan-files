　　On Representing New Things
　　Lü Ying

　　Discovering new things and representing new things has become a major task for writers of people's literature today. But how do we discover and represent new things?

　　Some novice writers went to the countryside to participate in land reform, collected some material, but found it difficult to write. They said: They couldn't grasp what new things were.

　　I have not participated in land reform. A few days ago, I attended a land reform struggle meeting in a village near the suburbs. At the meeting, I saw peasants standing up one after another, using angry and resolute language to speak out about the grievances and hatred that they had been unable to speak, dared not speak, or had nowhere to appeal for many years. The accusers included young people, middle-aged people, and gray-haired elders, as well as women carrying children. They roared, scolded, recounted, waved their fists, and their eyes burned with flames, speaking the voice of truth and justice in the people's court. In front of them stood the landlord, head bowed and silent, admitting his guilt. They were once trampled underfoot by the landlords, but now they stood up and used their hands that cultivated and nurtured the earth to overthrow the landlord class and eliminate feudal forces. Just such a mass meeting made me feel that there were many, many new things.

　　What are new things? I think that what is "new" is something that negates the "old" existing things and represents something more advanced and further developed; it is not something that has no connection with the "old" existing things and suddenly appears out of thin air. Both theory and practice tell us that new sprouts grow out of old matter.

　　A peasant who has been oppressed and exploited all his life, standing up at a struggle meeting, angrily and resolutely accusing the landlord of his crimes, even if there are still backward and conservative elements in his thinking, is this action itself not something new? In social terms, this is a thorough revolution in which the working people have turned themselves over; in terms of individual thought, this is also a transformation. Of course, just such an action is far from enough and cannot form a new character. But isn't a new character precisely formed from this transformation, this starting point, and gradually progresses, grows, and develops? It is impossible to expect every backward and conservative peasant to become a revolutionary after attending a struggle meeting. And it is also impossible for a revolutionary to completely break away from the social environment in which he grew up and appear out of thin air like a character in mythology. Any qualitative change begins with quantitative changes on a certain material basis, gradually accumulates, and finally a sudden change occurs, producing a new quality.

　　Then, does this mean that in literary creation, to represent "new" things that are just emerging, it is also necessary to represent "old" existing things?

　　No, here, the "new" things that are just emerging and the "old" existing things cannot be formally opposed, but should be understood dialectically from the content, because the relationship between them is just like the relationship between a sprout and its material basis. The "new" things represented by literary creation cannot be just an imagined concept, but must be concrete, real, and break through the "old" things, negate the "old" things, and move forward.

　　Then, is imagination not allowed in the representation of new things?

　　Imagination is not only allowed, but also necessary. However, there are two kinds of imagination. One is real imagination, which is an abstraction of reality. The other is empty imagination, which is only an abstraction of concepts. Real imagination deepens and elevates reality, while empty imagination floats and blurs reality. Only through the former kind of imagination can we reach everything that is emerging and unborn.

　　For us, "the most important thing is not what seems solid at the moment, but has already begun to decline, but what is being produced and is developing" ("A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"), which is the principle of realistic literature authors in representing things. However, in order to truly grasp and practice this principle, we cannot simply imagine or speculate what is "being produced and developing"; but must first understand what is "seemingly solid in reality, but has already begun to decline," and recognize what breaks through it, negates it, and is "being produced and developed," so as to create concrete and real things. If we separate the "new things that are being produced and developing" from the real world and regard them as an isolated existence, with no connection to the surrounding environment, and appearing out of thin air; then the "new" things that are "being produced and developing" will become incomprehensible, absolute, a kind of concept, a kind of fantasy, that is, something that does not exist in reality.

　　Let's take a simple example. If we look for a Michurin apple that has already been completely transformed on an apple that is just undergoing Michurin transformation, what will be the result? Imagining the appearance of the transformed Michurin apple in our minds, and throwing away the apple that is just undergoing Michurin transformation, thinking that it does not count as a new thing, and insisting on finding something imagined that has not yet been produced in reality, can we find it?

　　In literary creation, there are many concrete and profound examples.

　　For example, Fadeyev's "The Rout" brilliantly represents new things and new characters. Soviet critics once called it "the poem of the birth of new people." But "The Rout" tells the story of the destruction of a guerrilla detachment. If an author only sees that Levinson is an ordinary captain who even loses battles, and that there are characters like Moroza, who steals melons and drinks alcohol, the weak and incompetent Kubrak, the wavering and disillusioned Mechik, and the cunning and evil Chizh in his team; and cannot discover his revolutionary qualities from such a captain, understand the iron-willed characters such as Bakhlanov, Tupikov, Metelitsa, and Ganka Riadkov from such a team, and cannot recognize the significance of their arduous struggle; then he shakes his head and says: There are no new things. Then it is difficult to find what new things are.

　　There must be no small number of such new things that pass before our eyes and are ignored by us.

　　After reading "The Rout," we strongly feel that Levinson and his soldiers stand before us with a compelling force and dazzling brilliance. However, in the novel, these new characters do not appear like gods riding the clouds and fog. They are all represented as people with flesh and blood, with reason and passion, with contradictions and weaknesses, with difficulties and struggles, real people and soldiers. Thus, in Levinson, we see the qualities of courage, determination, and wisdom, and also see a little bit of weakness. In his team, we see iron-willed soldiers, and also see characters like Moroza, Kubrak, Mechik, Chizh, etc.

　　Then, can we delete all the weaknesses of Levinson and others, Moroza, Mechik, and other characters, these "old" things, from the novel? Wouldn't it be even better to represent the revolutionary ranks and revolutionary characters if it were not entirely "new things"? Obviously, no. This is not only because all of this really exists in reality, but also because it is precisely what breaks through the "old" and negates the "old" that is growing up that is the "new" thing.

　　Lu Xun said this about Levinson in the "Postscript" to "The Rout":

　　"However, Levinson not only sometimes wavered and sometimes lost his composure, but the troops were finally besieged by the Japanese army and Kolchak's army, and only nineteen of the one hundred and fifty people remained. It can be said that they were completely destroyed. During the breakout, he was still inspired by Bakhlanov's suggestion. Compared with the novels in the world today where the protagonists are all unsurpassed and the careers are all perfect, this is really a disappointing book. The peaceful reformers who are waiting for godlike pioneers and gentlemanly masses are actually being punished by such facts in the world. When Mechik first arrived at Sharatuba's troops in the peasant team, he also felt this kind of disillusionment——

　　"The people around him were completely different from the characters created by his unrestrained imagination…………"(One of two) But the author immediately explained——

　　"Therefore, they are not characters in books, but real living people." (Ibid.)

　　Yes, this is an important point. This passage is not only worthy of vigilance from general readers, but especially worthy of deep thought from literary authors. In literature, can't we just represent new characters and new things as "characters in books" or "gods" in fantasy, but must be "real living people"? It is not difficult to write Levinson as heroic, firm, wise, and outstanding according to a certain subjective imagination. The difficulty lies in how to represent the qualities of these revolutionary soldiers through concrete life and actions, real conflicts and contradictions, and in the real process of life development. The difficulty lies in how to express his "newness," not only in his personal thoughts, language, and actions, but mainly in the leadership of the masses in every bit of revolutionary work, and in every step of the struggle; and, through these, to express the entire society and the entire era.

　　What are new things? Obviously, that does not mean something very novel and special, something that has never been seen before, but the most realistic and typical things that can represent the face of the new society and the trends of the new era. Such new things must first be the most profound and essential things, the most progressive and revolutionary things——that is, the new sprouts.

　　That day, after attending the struggle meeting, on the way back, I walked across the vast fields. The northern fields in February were still desolate, with no green to be seen. However, if you look carefully and attentively, you can see dense wheat seedlings everywhere in the gray and yellow soil. They withstood the devastation of winter ice and snow, and are now sprouting vigorously, growing upwards. They will use their lush and youthful life to make the fields bright and brilliant. Seeing them, I immediately felt that the earth was full of the breath of spring. They do not only grow in a certain place, but are all over the earth, where there are working people, and where working people live and cultivate, there they are. …

　　关于表现新事物
　　吕荧
    发现新事物，表现新事物，已经成了人民文学作者当前的重大的课题了。可是，怎样发现、表现新事物呢？
    有几个初学的作者，到乡村去参加了土地改革回来，收集了一些材料，可是感到写起来很困难。他们说：抓不住什么是新事物。
    土地改革我没有参加过。前些天我去参加了郊区附近一个乡村的土地改革斗争会。在会场上，我看见农民们一个又一个站起来，用愤怒的坚决的语言，说出许多年来不能说不敢说无处申诉的冤屈和仇恨。控诉的人有年青人，有中年人，还有白发苍苍的老者，背着孩子的妇女。他们怒吼着，责骂着，数说着，挥动着拳头，眼睛里燃烧着火焰，在人民的法庭上说出真理和正义的声音。在他们前面，站着低垂着头一声不响的畏罪的地主。他们从前是被地主踏在脚底下的，现在站起来，用耕种大地抚育大地的手，推翻地主阶级扫除封建势力了。仅仅是这样一个群众的大会，我就觉得有许多许多新事物。
    什么才是新事物呢？我想，所谓“新的”，那是否定了“旧的”已在的事物，代表更高级的更进一步发展的东西；并不是和“旧的”已在的事物毫无关联，突然凌空出现的什么事物。理论和实践都告诉我们，新的萌芽是从旧的物质里生长出来的。
    一个终生受着压迫和剥削的农民，他在斗争会上站起来，愤怒地坚决地控诉地主的罪恶，尽管他的思想里还有落后保守的地方，这个行动本身不就是新的东西么？在社会方面，这是劳动人民彻底翻身的革命，在个人的思想方面，这也就是一个转变。自然，只是这样的一个行动还很不够，还不能形成一个新的人物。但是新的人物不正是由这个转变、这个起点开始，逐步的前进，成长发展起来的么？希望每一个落后保守的农民开过斗争会之后就变成功革命者，这是不可能的。而一个革命者，完全脱离他所生长的社会环境，像神话中的人物似地凌空出现，这也是不可能的。任何质的变化，都是在一定的物质基础上，由量的变化开始，逐渐积起，最后发生突变，产生了新质。
    那末，这是不是说，在文学的创作上，要表现“新的”方生的事物，也需要表现“旧的”已在的事物呢？
    不，在这里，“新的”方生的事物和“旧的”已在的事物不能形式地对立起来，而是应该统一地辩证地从内容上来理解它们，因为它们之间的关系，正如同萌芽之于物质基础的关系。文学创作所表现的“新的”事物，不能只是一个想像的观念，而必须是具体的、实在的、突破了“旧的”事物，否定了“旧的”事物前进的“新的”东西。
    那末，在新事物的表现上，是不是就不容许想像呢？
    想像，不但容许，而且是必要的。不过，想像也有两种。一种是真实的想像，它是现实的抽象。一种是空虚的想像，它只是观念的抽象。真实的想像深化而且提高现实，空虚的想像浮化而且模糊现实。我们只有经过前面一种想像，才能达到一切方生和未生的事物。
    对于我们，“最重要的不是现时似乎坚固，但已经开始衰亡的东西，而是正在产生正在发展的东西”（《联共党史简明教程》），这是新现实主义的文学作者表现事物的原则。可是，为了真实地把握、实践这个原则，我们就不能仅仅只是想像或者臆测什么才是“正在产生与发展的东西”；而要首先了解什么是“现实似乎坚固，但已经开始衰亡的东西”，要去认识什么东西突破了它否定了它，正在“产生与发展”出来，这样才能创造具体的实在的东西。要是把“正在产生与正在发展的‘新的’东西”从现实世界脱离开来，看成一种孤立存在的、和周围环境没有任何关联的、凌空出现的东西；那样的“正在产生与正在发展的”“新的”东西，就要成了不可理解的东西，绝对的东西，一种观念，一种空想，也就是现实中不存在的东西了。
    让我们举一个简单的例子。如果我们在初初发生米邱林变化的苹果身上去找已经变化完成的米邱林苹果，结果将是怎样？心里想像着变化完成的米邱林苹果的样子，而把初初发生米邱林变化的苹果扔开，认为算不得是新事物，一定要找那现实中还没有产生的想像的东西，是不是能找到呢？
    在文学创作上，有许多具体的深刻的例子。
    例如法捷耶夫的《毁灭》，这本书里杰出地表现了新事物和新人物，苏联批评家曾经称它是“新人诞生的诗”。但是《毁灭》所写的，却是一个游击队毁灭的故事。如果一个作者，只看到莱奋生是个平平常常连打败仗的队长，在他的队伍里面有偷瓜酗酒的木罗式加、懦弱无能的苦勃拉克、动摇幻灭的美谛克、狡滑恶劣的企什之类的人物；而不能从这样的队长身上发现他的革命者的品质，从这样的队伍里了解巴克拉诺夫、图皤夫、美迭里札、刚卡连珂等等铁一般的人物，不能认识他们艰苦进行的斗争的意义；就摇摇头说：没有什么新事物。那就很难找到什么是新事物了。
    像这样的新事物，从我们眼前经过，而被我们忽略了，一定是不在少数的。
    我们读了《毁灭》，非常强烈地感到莱奋生和他的战士们，以迫人的感动力和逼人的光辉，站在我们面前。然而在小说里，这些新人物并不是神人似的腾云驾雾式的出现的。他们都是作为有血有肉的人，有理智有热情、有矛盾有弱点、有困苦有斗争的，真实的人和战士，表现出来的。于是在莱奋生身上，我们看到英勇坚决智慧的品质，也看到有一点两点弱的地方，在他的队伍里我们看到铁一般的战士，也看到木罗式加、苦勃拉克、美谛克、企什之类的人物………。
    那末，我们能不能把莱奋生等人的弱点，木罗式加，美谛克之类的人物，这些“旧的”事物，统统从小说里删去呢？那不完全都是“新事物”，不更能表现革命的队伍和革命的人物么？显然的，不能。这不仅因为这一切都是现实中真实存在的，而且因为正是那个突破了“旧的”、否定了“旧的”在成长起来的东西，才是“新的”事物。
    鲁迅先生在《毁灭》的“后记”里这样说到莱奋生：
    “然而莱奋生不但有时动摇，有时失措，部队也终于受日本军和科尔却克军的围击，一百五十人只剩了十九人，可以说，是全部毁灭了。突围之际，他还是因为受了巴克拉诺夫的暗示。这和现在世间通行的主角无不超绝，事业无不圆满的小说一比较，实在是一部令人扫兴的书。平和的改革家之在静待神人一般的先驱，君子一般的大众者，其实就为了惩于世间有这样的事实。美谛克初到农民队的夏勒图巴部下去的时候，也曾感到这一种幻灭的——
    “周围的人们，和从他奔放的想像所造成的，是全不相同的人物…………”（一之二）但作者即刻给以说明道——
    “因此他们就并非书本上的人物，却是真的活的人。”（同上）
    是的，这是重要的地方。这一段话，不但值得一般的读者警惕，更特别值得文学作者深思。在文学上，我们表现新人物新事物，岂不是不能只是“书本上的人物”或者空想中的“神人”，而必须是“真的活的人”么？要是按照主观的一定的想像，把莱奋生写得怎样英勇坚定智慧卓越，是并不难的。难就难在怎样把他的这些革命战士的品质通过具体的生活和行动，实在的冲突和矛盾来表现，在真实的生命发展过程中来表现。难就难在怎样把他的“新”，不仅表现在个人的思想语言行动里，主要地表现在领导群众进行革命的一点一滴的工作里，一步一趋的斗争里；并且，通过这些来表现出整个的社会和整个的时代。
    什么是新事物呢？显然，那意思决不是说什么十分新奇十分特别，从来没有见过的某种东西，而是说最现实的最典型的东西，能够表现新社会的面貌和新时代的动向的东西。这样的新事物，首先非是最深刻最本质的事物不可，最富有前进性革命性的事物不可——也就是新的萌芽。
    那一天参加了斗争会回来，在路上，走过广大的田野。二月里的北方的田野还是荒凉的，看不到绿色。可是，如果仔细地留心地看，就能看到在灰沉沉的黄土里，到处都是密密的麦苗。它们抗住了冬天冰雪的摧残，正放出茁壮的萌芽，向上生长。它们就要用茂盛的青春的生命使田野光辉灿烂起来。看到它们，立刻感到大地充满春的气息。它们并不是只生长在某一个地方，而是遍布整个的大地，那里有劳动人民，有劳动人民生活耕种，那里就有它们。……
