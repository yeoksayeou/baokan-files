　　How to Do Farm Irrigation Work Better?
　　Zhang Zilin, Director of the Farmland Water Conservancy Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government

　　In 1950, large-scale farmland irrigation construction work was launched throughout the country, and great achievements were made. A total of 127 major channels were restored and newly built, 254,464 small reservoirs, dams and dikes were widely repaired and renovated, 68,314 new wells were dug, 53,089 old wells (including earthen wells) were repaired, 269 artesian wells and machine wells were drilled, and 118,781 iron-wheeled waterwheels were manufactured (82,291 were loaned out), 13,308 old waterwheels were repaired, and over 69,000 sets of water-lifting tools such as dragon-bone waterwheels and windlasses were added and repaired. In addition, more than 3,000 pumping machines were added and modified. In total, various projects have expanded the benefited area by 7.75 million mu and guaranteed and directly improved the benefited area by 29.72 million mu. The People's Liberation Army in various places played a great role in responding to Chairman Mao's call to participate in water conservancy construction, especially in more remote areas, which solved the problem of labor shortage in the local area.

　　In the past year, we have realized that the following issues urgently need to be resolved in order to do our work better in the future.

　　(1) Concerning Mass Farmland Irrigation

　　Last year's farmland irrigation work focused on the repair of small and medium-sized water conservancy projects as conditions for the construction of large-scale farmland irrigation projects in most areas were not yet ripe. These had the greatest effect, especially small-scale water conservancy projects, which cost less, benefited quickly, and benefited greatly, and could be undertaken by the masses themselves, making them most popular with the masses. For example, in East China and Central South China, a total of more than 250,000 small projects for drainage and irrigation were completed last year by building ponds, dams and culverts, resulting in an increase of about 1.4 billion catties of grain. In North China provinces and Shandong last year, the repair and renovation of small and medium-sized channels and the promotion of waterwheels and wells to transform dry land into paddy fields benefited a total area of 4.44 million mu of farmland, equivalent to six times the benefited area of large channels.

　　However, there are still the following problems in the leadership of small-scale water conservancy in various places: (1) Some provinces still do not know or do not attach importance to the importance of mass water conservancy, and put all their strength and cadres on individual larger projects directly led by the province, causing mass water conservancy construction to take place spontaneously. We believe that this year we should vigorously strengthen organizational leadership, combine the experience and wisdom of the masses, and make small and medium-sized water conservancy the focus of all farmland water conservancy work. (2) When carrying out extensive development, close attention should be paid to technical guidance and assistance to reverse the thinking of some technicians who only want to do large-scale projects and do not want to intervene in small-scale water conservancy. (3) To mobilize the masses to build water conservancy projects, it is necessary to organize a relatively sound construction organization based on the masses, which should include local government cadres, local experienced personnel, representatives of beneficiary households, and activists. Through this organization, as well as various meetings, the enthusiasm of the masses for building water conservancy projects can be inspired, and various specific problems in the project can be solved under leadership. (4) Last year, the government loaned more than 60 million catties of millet for mass water conservancy, which played a great role in the development of farmland water conservancy. However, due to the late issuance, and the unclear system of lending and recovery, many deviations occurred in various places. Some places were afraid that the masses would not be able to repay, so they shelved the loans; some places took the loans to relieve disasters; and some places distributed them evenly, without grasping the key points. All of these must be overcome in this year's water conservancy work, and attention should be paid to the special use of loans and to ensure repayment.

　　(2) Concerning Irrigation Management

　　With the establishment of the people's regime, the channel management work in various places has been or is being reformed, changing the old feudal system of monopolizing water use and gradually moving towards democratic management. After the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government issued instructions on strengthening irrigation management in the summer of 1950, various places began to pay attention to combining agricultural technology to implement scientific channel water use management, and achieved preliminary results and experience in saving water, reducing disputes, expanding irrigation area, and improving unit yield in some areas. For example, in some irrigation areas in Northeast China, after improving irrigation management and farming methods, the rice yield per hectare (equivalent to 15 mu) generally increased from 5,000 catties to 10,000 catties, and the yield per hectare in the experimental area of Chahayang Farm exceeded 20,000 catties. For example, in the Danhe Irrigation Area of ​​Pingyuan Province, due to the improvement of channel management and the strengthening of mass-based organizations, the irrigation area expanded from 47,000 mu to 84,000 mu. Jinghui Fourth Branch Canal in Shaanxi Province implemented planned water distribution according to the needs of crops. Although the weather was dry and the water volume was greatly reduced, the yield of perennial crops was still maintained. However, in terms of the overall management work, there are still many serious shortcomings: (1) Most water conservancy leading organs and most water conservancy work cadres do not have sufficient understanding of the consequences of "only paying attention to construction but not management." Many areas do not improve the management of existing projects, but only like to concentrate their efforts on building new projects. As a result, the old ones have not been fully utilized, and the newly built ones lack a management system and cannot quickly function. In the future, in addition to strengthening mass management organizations and improving centralized leadership institutions, research and experimental work should be carried out in areas with conditions to establish a water use system and rationally distribute water according to crop, season, and soil conditions. (2) In some areas, the feudal water regulations and water schedules left over from the old society have not been completely destroyed, and there are many contradictions between land users, and between upstream and downstream, so the disputes that have occurred have not been reasonably resolved. Although larger channels generally have management offices or management bureaus, they lack a mass-based organization and strong support from higher-level leading organs, and have not been able to fully play their role. At present, if some new areas can combine land reform, improve grassroots water conservancy organizations through mass elections, enlighten farmers to implement water use that takes care of downstream from upstream, and implement the spirit of individual interests obeying overall interests, it can not only reduce or even avoid water conservancy disputes, but also give play to the enthusiasm of the masses and push the entire management work forward.

　　(3) Engineering Construction Issues

　　In 1950, although it was only the first year of construction, many state-owned projects were constructed with a focus in various places in the absence of complete data and a lack of cadres. The achievements made have greatly exceeded any era during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and have laid the foundation for our large-scale irrigation in the future. Forty-three irrigation areas, including Panshan Farm, Chahayang Farm, and East Liaohe River, were constructed in the Northeast. In North China, there were three major state-owned siltation and irrigation projects in Chahar Province, as well as the Jiyun River electric water lifting irrigation project directly led by the Ministry of Agriculture, Huangyang Dam in Suiyuan West Back Set, and Xiaoche River and Hutuo River projects in Shanxi. The Luohe Canal Irrigation Project was restored in the Northwest Region. In total, the state funds used for large-scale projects in various places amounted to about 300 million catties of rice. However, based on the experience of the past year, there are some issues in project construction that need to be paid attention to in the future: (1) In terms of leadership, at first, only the favorable conditions in the basic aspects of politics, economy, and manpower were seen, as well as the people's urgent need to build water conservancy and restore agricultural production, but there was insufficient understanding of the arduousness of large-scale water conservancy project construction and the lack of data and technology. Therefore, some plans cannot be completed on time and achieve the expected results. (2) When carrying out planning and design, most engineering personnel often do not conduct practical investigations and research on soil quality, crops, and other conditions, but only determine the planning and design of the channel head, main channel, and buildings based on rough estimates. As for the more important water distribution channel system, most of them have no design and layout. In this way, due to the lack of a reasonable overall planning of the entire irrigation system from beginning to end, the system is disordered, water distribution is difficult, the degree of water waste is increased, and the benefiting time is delayed.

　　In view of the above situation, in the future, we should establish a long-term construction point of view, fully estimate the subjective strength and objective conditions, and concentrate our efforts on running some key projects. However, before the project is carried out, it is absolutely necessary to conduct accurate surveys and collect sufficient data, and combine it with the local agricultural situation to make a detailed and comprehensive planning and design.

　　(4) Concerning the Promotion of Waterwheels and Mechanical Irrigation

　　North China and Shandong established a professional organization, the "Water Conservancy Promotion Agency," to lay a favorable foundation for the manufacture, promotion, and loan of iron-wheeled waterwheels. In the past year, the irrigation area in North China increased by about one million mu due to the loan of waterwheels. The Northwest also began to pay attention to waterwheels and, after researching and improving the performance of the Liberation-style waterwheel, it was tried and promoted, and was warmly welcomed by farmers. In total, the production of waterwheels last year was equivalent to one-half of the total number of old waterwheels (there are about 250,000 old waterwheels in the country), and the number of waterwheels loaned out has reached one-third of the total number of old waterwheels. This is one of the major measures taken by the New China for the vast number of farmers in the first year of its establishment, and has been generally supported by the masses.

　　The production and loan of waterwheels last year was not based on actual needs in some areas, but was purely based on the distribution figures; and because no attention was paid to business learning and technical research work, some areas still had the problem of "high cost, low quality, and insufficient technical guidance" in production management, which hindered the loan work. These need to be gradually improved in this year's work.

　　Mechanical irrigation work has been developed in East China and Central South China. In particular, in southern Jiangsu, the original water-drawing merchants were organized to pump water, solving the irrigation of 2 million mu of paddy fields, with great results. In addition, some typical demonstration work on mechanical irrigation was also carried out in Zhejiang and Guangdong. But this is, after all, a new cause, and all places lack experience. At the same time, the masses' ability to use machines and the specifications and quality of the machines themselves are not suitable for use in the vast rural areas. Therefore, in the near future, we can only start from experiments and move forward steadily. This is what we must clearly recognize in our thinking.

　　怎样把农田水利工作做得更好些？
    中央人民政府农业部农田水利局局长  张子林
    一九五○年全国各地展开了大规模的农田水利建设工作，获得了很大的成绩。总计全年重点恢复与兴修大型渠道一二七处，普遍增修整修小型渠堰塘坝二五四、四六四处，打新井六八、三一四眼，修理旧井（包括土井）五三、○八九眼，凿自流井与机井二六九眼，制造铁轮水车一一八、七八一辆（出贷八二、二九一辆），修理旧水车一三、三○八辆，增加及修复龙骨水车风车筒车等提水工具六万九千余架，另添制及改装抽水机三千余部，总计各项共扩大受益面积七七五万亩，保障及直接改善受益面积二九七二万亩。各地人民解放军在响应毛主席号召参加水利建设上，发挥了极大作用，尤其是在较偏僻地区，更解决了当地劳力缺乏的困难。
    在过去一年中，我们体会到有以下几个问题，亟需提出解决，以便今后把工作做得更好些。
            （一）关于群众性的农田水利
    去年的农田水利工作，由于大部地区兴建大型农田水利工程的条件尚不成熟，因而以兴修中小型水利工程收效最大，尤其是小型水利工程，花钱少，受益快，得利大，群众自己也能举办，最受群众欢迎。例如华东及中南，去年修建塘坝涵闸进行排水灌溉的小型工程，共完成了二十五万余处，因而增产粮食约十四亿斤。华北各省及山东去年在修整中小型渠道和推广水车水井变旱地为水田上，共使农田受益面积达四百四十余万亩，相当大型渠道受益面积的六倍。
    但是各地在小型水利的领导上还存在着以下几个问题：（一）个别省份尚不知或不重视群众性水利的重要，而把全部力量和干部放在省直接领导的个别较大工程上，致使群众兴修水利形成自流。我们认为在今年应该用大力加强组织领导，结合群众的经验与智慧，把中小型水利作为全部农田水利工作的重点。（二）在广泛开展的时候，应密切注意技术上的指导与帮助，扭转某些技术人员只愿做大型工程不愿过问小型水利的思想。（三）发动群众兴修水利，需要组织以群众为基础的比较健全的施工组织，其中应包括当地政府干部、本地有经验的人员，受益户代表及积极分子等。通过这种组织，以及各种会议，可以启发群众兴修水利的热情，并有领导地解决工程中的各项具体问题。（四）去年政府在群众性的水利方面共贷放小米六千余万斤，对农田水利事业的发展，起了很大作用。不过由于发放较迟，出贷及收回制度不明确，在各地发生了不少偏差。有的地方怕群众还不起，而将贷款搁置；有的地方把贷款拿了去救灾；有的地方平均分配，没有掌握重点。这些在今年的水利工作中，都必须设法克服，应注意贷款的专款专用，并保证归还。
            （二）关于灌溉管理工作
    随着人民政权的建立，各地的渠道管理工作，已经进行或正进行改革旧存的封建把持行水制度，逐渐走向民主管理。一九五○年夏季，中央农业部发布了加强灌溉管理的指示之后，各地开始注意了结合农业技术实行科学管理渠道用水，并在部分地区取得了节省用水，减少纠纷，扩大灌溉面积，提高单位产量的初步成绩和经验。例如东北的某些灌溉区，经改善灌溉管理及耕作方法之后，每垧（合十五市亩）稻田稻谷产量普遍由五千斤提高到一万斤，查哈阳农场试验区每垧产量则超过二万斤。又如平原省丹河灌溉区，由于改善渠道管理，加强群众基层组织，灌溉面积由四万七千亩扩大为八万四千亩。陕西省泾惠第四支渠实行了按作物需要有计划地配水，虽然天气干旱，水量大减，但仍保持了常年作物的产量。不过就整个管理工作来说，目前仍存在着许多严重缺点：（一）多数省份水利领导机关及多数水利工作干部，对“只顾兴修，不加管理”的后果认识不足。不少地区对现有工程的管理不加改善，却只喜欢集中力量兴修新的工程，结果旧有的既未充分利用，新修的亦缺乏管理系统，不能迅速发生作用。今后除须加强群众管理组织，健全集中领导的机构外，并应在有条件的地区，进行研究试验工作，确立用水制度，按作物，季节，土质等情况，合理配水。（二）有些地区的渠道，旧社会遗留的封建水规水程，尚未完全摧毁，地户与地户，上游与下游之间的矛盾极多，因而发生的纠纷还未得到合理解决。较大渠道虽然大都有管理处或管理局的组织，但多缺乏群众的基础组织和上级领导机关的有力支持，未能充分发挥作用。在目前，某些新区如能结合土地改革，通过群众的选举改善水利基层组织，启发农民实行上游照顾下游的使水，贯彻个体利益服从整体利益的精神，不但可以减少甚至避免水利纠纷，并可发挥群众的积极性，使整个管理工作，向前推进一步。
            （三）工程建设问题
    一九五○年，虽系刚刚开始建设的第一年，各地在资料不全，干部缺乏的情况下，仍有重点地兴修了不少的国营工程，所获成就已大大超过了国民党反动统治时期的任何年代，并打下我们今后大规模灌溉的基础。在东北兴修了盘山农场，查哈阳农场及东辽河等四十三个灌区，华北有察哈尔省三大国营淤灌工程，及农业部直接领导的蓟运河电力提水灌溉工程，绥西后套黄阳闸及山西潇河，滹沱河工程，西北区修复了洛惠渠灌溉工程等，总计各地大型工程共动用国家资金米约三亿斤。但是在工程建设上，根据一年来的经验，有以下一些问题，今后需加以注意：（一）在领导方面，最初只看到政治、经济、人力各个基本方面具备的有利条件，和人民对兴修水利恢复农业生产的迫切要求，但对大型水利工程建设的艰巨性和对资料缺乏技术不足的情况认识不够。因而有的计划不能按时完成和收到预期的效果。（二）大部分工程人员，在进行规划设计时，往往对土质、作物等情况，不做切实的调查研究，只根据粗略估计，即确定渠首、干渠及建筑物的规划和设计，至于更重要的配水渠道系统，则大多没有设计和布置。这样，由于缺乏从头到尾全盘灌溉系统的合理规划，于是系统紊乱，配水困难，增大水量的浪费程度，拖延了受益时间。
    针对以上情况，今后应树立长期建设的观点，充分估计主观力量和客观条件，集中力量举办一些重点工程。但在工程进行以前，必须进行精确勘测和搜集足够资料，并结合当地农业情况，作出详尽全面的规划设计，这都是十分必要的。
            （四）关于推广水车与机械灌溉
    华北各地及山东成立了专业机构“水利推进社”，给铁轮水车的制造、推广、出贷工作，打下有利的基础。在去年一年内，华北地区由于出贷水车，灌溉面积约增加了一百万亩。西北对水车也开始重视，并将解放式水车性能加以研究改进后，试行推广，受到农民热烈欢迎。总计去年水车的生产即相当旧有水车总数（全国旧有水车约二十五万辆）的二分之一，并已贷出水车相当旧有水车总数三分之一。这是新中国成立后第一年对广大农民重大的措施之一，已得到群众普遍拥护。
    去年的水车生产和出贷工作，有些地区还不是从实际需要情况出发，而是单纯从分配数字出发；又因对业务学习与技术研究工作没有重视，因而某些地区在生产管理上尚存在着“成本高，质量低，技术指导不够”的毛病，使出贷工作受到阻碍，这些都需在今年工作中逐步改进。
    机械灌溉工作在华东、中南有了开展。特别在苏南组织了原有戽水商进行抽水，解决了二百万亩稻田的灌溉，成绩很大，另外在浙江、广东也进行了一些机械灌溉的典型示范工作。但这究竟是一种新的事业，各地都缺乏经验，同时群众使用机器的能力及机件本身的规格品质也还不适合于广大农村使用，故最近期内还只能从试验做起，稳步前进，这是我们在思想上必须明确认识的。
