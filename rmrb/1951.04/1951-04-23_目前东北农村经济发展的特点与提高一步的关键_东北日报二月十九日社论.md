The Current Characteristics of Rural Economic Development in Northeast China and Key to Further Improvement
-- Northeast Daily Editorial, February 19th

(I) The main characteristic of rural economic development is: the middle peasant is gradually becoming the majority in rural areas.

Since the Northeast Bureau held a rural work symposium at the end of 1949, the rural economy in Northeast China has developed rapidly. Agricultural production has greatly increased. Agricultural production in 1949 was 13.2 million tons, which increased to 18.08 million tons in 1950, an increase of 37 percent, reaching 99.48 percent of the 1943 level. The unit yield per hectare was 2,514 jin, exceeding 1943 by 13.93 percent. The grain output of some counties has exceeded the highest level before the "815" incident. For example, the total output of Shulan County in 1943 was 139,566 tons, and in 1950 it reached 166,758 tons, exceeding 1943 by 19.48 percent. The planting area of industrial raw materials increased from 236,796 hectares in 1949 (accounting for 1.53 percent of the cultivated area) to 578,317 hectares in 1950 (accounting for 3.54 percent of the cultivated area), an increase of 144.24 percent. Livestock and agricultural implements have also increased. According to statistics from Shulan County, there were 29,799 head of draught animals in 1943, 30,213 in 1948, 44,290 in 1949, and 60,303 in 1950, an increase of 102 percent compared with 1943. These facts prove that the rural economy in Northeast China has recovered to some extent and even exceeded the pre-war level. Due to the abolition of feudal exploitation, the reduction of farmers' burdens, and the narrowing of the price difference between industrial and agricultural products, farmers' purchasing power has been unprecedentedly improved, expanding the industrial market. The number of cloths sold by state-owned commercial enterprises in Northeast China was 4 million bolts in 1949 and 9.02 million bolts in 1950, an increase of 125 percent compared with 1949. In recent years, the increasing trend of farmers' purchasing power has been that the proportion of means of production has gradually increased. According to a survey in Minzhu Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, means of production accounted for only 10.7 percent of total purchasing power in 1949, while means of subsistence accounted for 89.3 percent. By the spring of 1950, the proportion of means of production had increased to 23 percent. According to a survey in Yaobao Village, Hulan County, Songjiang Province, means of production accounted for 19 percent of purchasing power in 1949, which increased to 35.5 percent in 1950. Farmers have a high enthusiasm for production, and the idea of agricultural socialism has been basically overcome. The proportion of means of production owned by farmers is increasing year by year, which further lays the foundation for future expanded reproduction in agriculture.

The basic characteristic of the current rural economic development is: most farmers are rising (with a small number of farmers rising slower), and only a very small number of farmers are declining due to special reasons. The number of farmers who can cultivate their own land with their own horses and agricultural implements has become the majority in rural areas. For example, in Yaobao Village, Hulan County, Songjiang Province in the old liberated areas, such farmers account for more than 70 percent of the 314 households. In Xujia, Kaoshan, Yangqiao, and Zhongzheng Tun in Shulan County, Jilin Province, such farmers account for 73.1 percent of the 565 households in total. In Tuanjie Village, Panshi County, they account for 69.8 percent of the total number of households. In Xiaobao Tun, Fengcheng County, Liaodong Province, which was liberated later, such farmers also account for 51.3 percent of the 84 households surveyed. This is based on the situation of typical surveys. In terms of the entire Northeast China, the above-mentioned farmers account for about 50 percent or more in the new liberated areas, and about 60 to 70 percent in the old liberated areas. The large increase in the number of such farmers is a common phenomenon in the current rural economic development in Northeast China.

The middle peasant becoming the majority in rural areas is the main characteristic of the current rural economic development. The new middle peasants are generally strong and have strong horses, playing a dominant role in rural production. For example, according to a survey of Victory, Xinfa, and Xinli villages in Zhenxi District, Baichengzi County, Heilongjiang Province, there are 332 households in the three villages, and 212 are middle peasants, accounting for 63.8 percent of the number of households, 69.5 percent of the male labor force, 87.5 percent of the livestock, 75.7 percent of the land, 86.4 percent of the carts, and 76.8 percent of the total output. The middle peasant has become the main force in current agricultural production, but it is still necessary to strengthen the economic strength of the middle peasant. Their fundamental demand is to sell surplus grain and expand reproduction. In some areas (mainly areas with little land and no wasteland to be reclaimed), some of the faster-developing well-off middle peasants feel that there is no way out for their surplus labor, livestock, and surplus grain. They want to expand the cultivated area, but there is no place to buy and reclaim wasteland. The sales of sideline production are difficult, and the improvement of agricultural technology is restricted by conditions. Therefore, actively seeking a way out for development is the demand of these farmers. In addition, there are still some farmers who are rising slowly. From their current living conditions, they are not as good as the middle peasants before the land reform. They still lack the necessary draught animals and agricultural implements, and they still have difficulties in developing production. It is still necessary to study the reasons why they cannot rise and raise them to the level of the middle peasant. Due to the development of the entire national economy, the agricultural population has begun to transfer to industry, mining, cities, commerce, and handicrafts, and land has also begun to be readjusted (this readjustment is carried out by the masses automatically in an economic way), which is beneficial to the development of production.

The above is the fundamental situation in the current rural economic development, which is the basic starting point for us to determine policies and work.

(II) Local Party and government should concentrate all their efforts to meet the new demands of farmers for expanded reproduction.

Although the rural economy has developed rapidly in the past year, the level of productivity is still very low. The key to further developing the rural economy, in addition to continuing to implement the established policies, should be to do arduous work in the following aspects to solve the requirements of farmers to expand reproduction:

(1) Vigorously develop agricultural production, especially the production of commodity grain and industrial raw materials. The planting area of commodity grain and industrial raw materials should be planned and expanded according to the needs of industry and the production and sales situation of the market, and the planned increase in the production of commercial crops should be taken as the guiding ideology for Party and government at all levels to lead agricultural production. Different development focuses should be proposed in different regions. For example, South Manchuria can grow more cotton, flax, and various industrial raw materials and special products. North Manchuria can grow more wheat, commodity grain such as soybeans, and flax. East Manchuria can grow more rice. In some areas of West Manchuria with pastures, cattle and sheep can be bred in large quantities and animal husbandry can be placed in a major position. In this way, a proper division of labor between regions can be gradually achieved in order to adjust the planting ratio of food crops and special crops, solve sales problems, promote industrial development, and increase farmers' income.

At present, the rural economy that occupies a dominant position in our country is still the decentralized small-scale peasant economy. The decisive link in realizing the above-mentioned policy lies in dispelling farmers' ideological concerns about the sales, prices, and public grain conversion rates of commodity grain, and solving the difficulties in agricultural investment and technical guidance. Reasonable purchase prices for commodity grain and industrial raw materials should be stipulated (opposing the so-called "downgrading" method of disguised price reductions). Purchasing departments need to set reasonable prices and specifications before the spring plowing, and sign purchase contracts with farmers through cooperatives in the producing areas. It is also necessary to stipulate appropriate conversion rates for collecting public grain, and implement the policy of rewarding the production of commodity grain and industrial raw materials in all aspects to ensure the completion of the plan. Technical personnel are also needed to provide specific guidance on technical crops to increase the unit yield. This is a very complicated organizational work, but only in this way can the goal of gradual development be achieved.

(2) Local industry and private industry and handicrafts should be organized and guided to face the countryside, and production tools needed by farmers to expand reproduction should be manufactured in a planned way. They should be supplied with a sufficient quantity of qualified, strong, and durable agricultural implements in terms of iron, wood, leather, hemp, etc. The National Bank should support certain improved agricultural implements that are indeed reliable according to the season, and they can only be promoted steadily, cautiously, and with emphasis, and prevent shoddy manufacturing. With the rise of the rural economy, farmers' needs for means of production have greatly increased, but our manufacturing and supply in this regard are still far behind the economic development of farmers. This state of imbalance between supply and demand should be addressed by state-owned commercial enterprises, cooperatives, and local industry, especially handicrafts, to sign production and sales contracts. They should also be helped to solve difficulties such as raw materials, funds, and transportation. The correct solution of this problem can not only meet the requirements of farmers to expand reproduction and promote the development of agricultural production, but also open up a larger market for the development of industry and commerce at the same time.

(3) Organized improvement of agricultural technology and increased investment in land are important links in increasing unit yield. The vast number of farmers are very interested in improving agricultural technology, and cadres leading agricultural production have paid attention to improving agricultural technology. In the future, in addition to paying attention to fixing land grades in the public grain policy and giving play to farmers' enthusiasm for improving agricultural technology, Party and government cadres at the county, district, and village levels should pay special attention to grasping one or two major events related to increasing farmers' income in the area at a certain period according to the different seasons and regions, deeply publicizing and demonstrating typical examples, forming a broad mass movement, and carrying out the work of improving agricultural technology. This is the most effective way to complete production. The focus of promotion should still be on summarizing and promoting farmers' experience in increasing production. More scientific and complex improvements in agricultural technology should first be demonstrated by state-owned farms, playing a leading role, accumulating experience, and promoting them steadily. However, in areas with more special products, technical personnel should be organized to go to the countryside to provide guidance.

(4) Although our rural economy has developed rapidly, the current economic conditions of farmers are still weak. Many individual farmers today cannot even afford a plow, let alone a rubber-wheeled cart. It is still necessary to organize farmers in terms of labor, livestock, and funds to solve the above-mentioned requirements. This is the new content and new purpose of the current organization. The central link in the consolidation and improvement of mutual aid teams in the future lies in strengthening leadership, combining organization with the improvement of agricultural technology, and solving new problems in expanded reproduction. In plain areas with less land and more labor, we should focus on improving technology to increase unit yield. In mountainous areas, we should focus on the combination of agricultural and sideline production. In eastern and western Liaoning, we should focus on organizing farmers' funds, livestock, labor, or certain technologies to develop special products and industrial raw materials.

(5) Due to the large increase in commodity grain and the increase in farmers' purchasing power, in order to invigorate urban and rural exchanges and open up the inland market, it is necessary to further improve and develop rural supply and marketing cooperatives, supply members with a large amount of production and living materials, promote the sales of members' agricultural and sideline products, and develop rural credit and loan undertakings to support the further development of agricultural production.

In order to implement the realization of this task, it is necessary to correctly select and continuously improve labor models, publicize and promote various typical experiences, and tightly grasp the seasonality of agriculture. Experience has proved that the season from autumn harvest to spring plowing is the most active season in the rural economy. Farmers demand to sell 60 to 70 percent of their surplus grain during this stage, and farmers' means of production are also prepared at this time. Doing a good job in this season is an important link in leading the development of agricultural production in a planned way. Rural Party and government should conduct in-depth research on the above issues during the spring plowing preparation process based on the specific conditions of the county, district, and village, discuss the plans and steps to achieve the plan, and improve agricultural production in 1951 by one step.

　　目前东北农村经济发展的特点与提高一步的关键
    ——东北日报二月十九日社论
    （一）农村经济发展的主要特征是：中农日渐成为农村中的多数
    自一九四九年底，东北局召开农村工作座谈会以来，东北农村经济有很迅速的发展，农业生产量大为增加，一九四九年农业生产量为一、三二○万吨、一九五○年增至一、八○八万吨，即增产百分之三十七，达一九四三年百分之九九点四八。每垧地单位产量二、五一四斤，超过了一九四三年百分之十三点九三。有些县份粮食产量已超过八一五前的最高水平，如舒兰一九四三年全县总产量一三九、五六六吨，一九五○年已达到一六六、七五八吨，已超过一九四三年的百分之十九·四八。工业原料的种植面积，一九四九年二三六、七九六垧（占耕地面积百分之一点五三）一九五○年增至五七八、三一七垧（占耕地面积百分之三点五四）即增加百分之一四四点二四。牲口农具也均有增加，据舒兰县的统计，一九四三年共有耕畜二九、七九九头，一九四八年三○、二一三头，一九四九年四四、二九○头，到一九五○年已增至六○、三○三头，即较一九四三年增加百分之一○二。这些事实证明东北农村经济已恢复有些并超过战前水平。由于封建剥削之废除，农民负担之减轻，工农产品差价之缩小，农民购买力已空前的提高，扩大了工业市场。全东北国家商业销布的数字，一九四九年四百万匹，一九五○年九○二万匹，即较一九四九年增加百分之一二五。近几年来农民购买力的增加趋势，是生产资料的比重逐年提高，据黑龙江省克山县民主村调查一九四九年生产资料仅占全购买力的百分之一○点七，而生活资料则占百分之八十九点三，而一九五○年春生产资料已提高到百分之二十三；另据松江呼兰腰堡村之调查：一九四九年生产资料占购买力百分之十九，一九五○年则提高为百分之三十五点五，农民生产积极性很高，农业社会主义的思想已基本克服，农民生产资料比重在逐年增加，它进一步打下了今后农业扩大再生产的基础。
    目前农村经济发展的基本特点：是大多数农民上升（其中少部分农民上升较慢），下降者仅是有特殊原因的极少数的农户。而以自己马匹农具能够耕种自己土地之农户已成为农村中的多数，如老区的松江呼兰县腰堡村三一四户，这种农户已占百分之七十以上；吉林省的舒兰县徐家、靠山、杨桥、中正屯四村共五六五户，其中这样的农户也占百分之七三点一，磐石团结村则占全村户数百分之六十九点八。而解放较晚的辽东凤城小堡屯八十四户调查，这样的农户亦占百分之五十一点三，这是根据典型调查的情况，若从全东北而言，新区上述的农户约占百分之五○以上，老区约占百分之六十到七十，这种农户大增是目前东北农村经济发展的普遍现象。
    中农成为农村中的多数，这是当前农村经济发展主要特征。新中农一般是人强马壮，在农村生产中起支配作用，如黑龙江白城子县镇西区胜利、新发、新立三个村的调查，三个村总户数三三二户，中农二一二户，占户数百分之六三点八，占男劳动力的百分之六九点五，占有畜力百分之八十七点五，占土地百分之七五点七，占大车百分之八六点四，占总产量百分之七六点八，中农已成为目前农业生产的主力军，但仍需充实中农的经济力量。他们根本的要求是，出卖余粮，扩大再生产，有些地区（主要是土地不多，无荒可开的地区）其中一部分发展快的富裕中农，其多余的劳力畜力余粮感到没有出路：欲扩大耕地面积，又无处购买与开荒，副业生产销路困难，改进农业技术又受条件的限制，因之积极找寻发展的出路是这部分农民的要求。除此之外尚有一部分农民上升较慢，从他们目前的生活状况说，还赶不上土地改革前的中农水平，他们还缺乏必要的耕畜和农具，他们在发展生产上还有困难，仍需研究他们不能上升的原因，把他们提高到中农生活的水平。由于整个的国民经济发展，农业人口已有向工矿、城市、商业、手工业转业的萌芽，土地亦开始在重新调整（这种调整是群众自动以经济方式进行的），这些均是有利于生产发展的。
    以上就是当前农村经济发展中的根本情况，也就是我们决定政策和工作的基本出发点。
    （二）地方党政应集中全力满足农民扩大再生产的新要求
    一年来农村经济虽有迅速的发展，但生产力的水平仍很低，进一步发展农村经济的关键，除继续贯彻既定的方针外，应从下列几个方面作艰巨的工作，以解决农民扩大再生产的要求：
    （１）大力发展农业生产，特别是商品粮及工业原料的生产，应根据工业需要和市场的产销情况，有计划地扩大商品粮及工业原料的种植面积，把有计划的增产商品性的农作物作为各级党政领导农业生产的指导思想。在不同地区应提出不同发展重点，如南满可多种棉麻及各种工业原料和特产，北满可多种小麦、大豆商品性的粮食及亚麻，东满可多种水稻，西满某些有牧场的地方，可大量繁殖牛羊把牧畜业放在主要的位置上，这样，逐步做到地区间的适当分工，以求进行调整粮食作物与特产作物的耕种比例，解决销路，促进工业发展并增加农民的收入。
    目前我们的农村经济占统治地位的，还是分散的小农经济，实现上述方针的决定的环节，在于打消农民对商品粮销路、价格、公粮折合率的思想顾虑，及解决农业投资、技术指导等方面的困难，合理的规定商品粮、工业原料收购价格（反对变相压价的所谓压等的办法），需要收购部门，在春耕前定出合理价格与规格，在产区通过合作社与农民订立收购合同。并需规定恰当的征收公粮的折合率，从各方面贯彻奖励商品粮与工业原料的生产政策，以保证计划的完成。对技术作物还需要技术人员具体指导，以提高单位产量，这是一个很复杂的组织工作，但只有如此，才能达到逐步发展的目的。
    （２）应有组织地指导地方工业及私人工业、手工业面向农村，有计划地制造农民为扩大再生产所需的生产工具，供应他们足够数量的、合乎规格、结实耐用的铁木、皮麻等方面的农具，国家银行根据季节加以扶助某些确有把握的改良农具，只能稳步慎重而有重点地推广，严防粗制滥造。随着农村经济的上升，农民生产资料的需要是大大增加了，但我们这方面的制造与供给，还远落在农民经济发展的后面，这个供需不平衡的状态，应由国家商业、合作社与地方工业、特别是手工业订立产销合同。并帮助他们解决原料、资金、运输等困难。这个问题的正确解决不仅可以满足农民扩大再生产的要求，推动农业生产的发展，而且同时给工商业的发展开辟更大的市场。
    （３）有组织地改进农业技术，增加土地的投资，这是提高单位产量的重要环节，广大农民对改进农业技术的兴趣很高，领导农业生产的干部对改进农业技术已引起了重视，今后除在公粮政策上注意固定土地等级，发挥农民改进农业技术积极性外，在县、区、村党、政干部领导上，应特别注意根据季节、地区的不同，在一定时期抓住该地有关增加农民收入的一、两件大事，深入宣传、典型示范，形成一个广泛的群众运动，把改进农业技术的工作展开，是完成生产的最有效的办法，推广的重点，仍应总结推广农民增产的经验为主，比较科学的复杂的农业技术之改进，首先由国营农场示范，起带头作用，积累经验，稳步推广。但在特产较多的地区，则要组织技术人员下乡指导。
    （４）我们农村经济虽有迅速的发展，但目前农民的经济条件还很弱，许多个体农民今天还拴不起一付犁杖，更拴不起一辆胶皮车，仍须在劳力上、畜力上、资金上把农民组织起来，以解决上列的要求，这就是目前组织起来的新内容新目的，今后互助组巩固与提高的中心环节，在于加强领导，使组织起来与改进农业技术结合，并解决扩大再生产中的新问题。在平川地区，土地少劳力多，应着重改进技术增加单位产量；山区应着重农副业生产的结合。辽东、辽西应着重组织农民资金、畜力、劳力或某种技术，发展特产及工业原料。
    （５）由于商品粮大量增加，农民购买力之提高，为了活跃城乡交流打开内地市场，需进一步提高与发展农村供销合作社，大量供给社员生产及生活资料，推销社员的农副业产品，发展农村的信用贷款事业，以扶助农业生产的进一步发展。
    为贯彻这一任务之实现，必须正确的选拔与不断提高劳动模范，宣传推广各种典型经验并紧紧地掌握农业的季节性。经验证明从秋收到春耕之前，是农村经济最活跃的季节，农民的余粮百分之六七十要求在这个阶段出售，农民的生产资料亦是在这个时候准备。搞好这个季节的工作，是有计划地领导农业生产发展的一个重要环节。农村党政，应在备耕过程中，对以上问题，根据本县、区、村具体情况，深入研究，讨论出实现计划和步骤，把一九五一年农业生产提高一步。
