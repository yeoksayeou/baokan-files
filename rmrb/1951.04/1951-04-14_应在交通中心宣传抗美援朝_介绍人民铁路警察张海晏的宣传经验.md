    Anti-American and Aid Korea Propaganda Should be Conducted in Transportation Hubs:
    Introducing the Propaganda Experience of People's Railway Policeman Zhang Haiyan

    Editor,

    I am writing to you to introduce a successful experience of Comrade Zhang Haiyan in conducting anti-American and aid Korea propaganda work to passengers at railway stations.

    Comrade Zhang Haiyan is a People's Police officer from the Yancheng Public Security Station of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau. Since the nationwide anti-American and aid Korea movement was launched, he has not only worked hard to do his own job, but also combined his work with current affairs propaganda on anti-American and aid Korea for passengers.

    From November 11th of last year to February 3rd of this year, he gave a total of 315 propaganda sessions, and 51,350 passengers listened to his propaganda. At the beginning of his propaganda work, Comrade Zhang Haiyan often found himself unable to speak. Soon, this difficulty was overcome. When giving propaganda, he starts with railway regulations, telling passengers what to pay attention to when taking the train. Then, using vivid examples, he explained the close relationship between the railway employees, the People's Police, and the people, making a clear comparison between the old and new China. He then propagated the current situation of the Korean War to passengers, explained the past and present acts of aggression and ambitions of American imperialism against our country, and explained that the strength of the Chinese and Korean people would definitely defeat the American aggressors. At the same time, he called on passengers to take practical actions in their own jobs to resist America and aid Korea to defend their homes and country. Comrade Zhang Haiyan's propaganda has moved tens of thousands of passengers. Many passengers raised questions and asked him to explain. A Comrade Zhang from the Huaiyang Military Subdistrict encouraged Comrade Zhang Haiyan in person after listening to the propaganda, hoping that he would continue this work.

    From the propaganda example of Comrade Zhang Haiyan, it can be seen that using transportation hubs such as railway stations for propaganda is an experience worth promoting. Because the propaganda is carried out through passengers coming from all directions and going to all directions, the influence will be particularly large. It is hoped that the working comrades at transportation hubs such as railway stations, bus stations, and wharves in various places can learn from the experience of Comrade Zhang Haiyan and carry out propaganda to passengers in a planned way, so as to make the anti-American and aid Korea movement more popular and more profound!

    应在交通中心宣传抗美援朝
    介绍人民铁路警察张海晏的宣传经验编辑同志：
    我现在向你们介绍张海晏同志在火车站向旅客进行抗美援朝宣传工作的一个成功经验。
    张海晏同志是郑州铁路局郾城公安所的人民警察。自全国人民掀起了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动后，他一面努力搞好自己的工作，同时还结合工作对旅客进行抗美援朝的时事宣传。
    从去年十一月十一日到今年二月三日止，他一共作了三百十五次宣传，听过他宣传的旅客已达五万一千三百五十人。张海晏同志在开始宣传时，常常有话说不出。不久，这困难就被克服了。他宣传时，先从铁路规章说起，告诉旅客乘火车时应注意的事项；再用生动的事例说明人民铁路员工、人民警察和人民的密切关系，把新旧中国作了明显的对比；然后再向旅客宣传朝鲜战局近况，说明美帝国主义过去和现在对我国的侵略行为和野心，说明中朝人民的力量一定可以打败美国侵略者；同时他号召旅客在自己工作岗位上以实际行动来抗美援朝保家卫国。张海晏同志的宣传已经感动了成千成万的旅客，有许多旅客提出问题，要求他讲解。淮阳军分区有一位张同志在听过宣传之后，当面鼓励张海晏同志，希望他把这个工作坚持下去。
    从张海晏同志的宣传实例，可以说明利用车站等交通要口进行宣传是一个值得推广的经验。因为通过来自四面八方又走向四面八方的旅客进行宣传，影响会特别大。希望各地火车站、汽车站、轮船码头等交通要口的工作同志，都能学习张海晏同志的经验，有计划地向旅客进行宣传，使抗美援朝运动更普及，更深入！
