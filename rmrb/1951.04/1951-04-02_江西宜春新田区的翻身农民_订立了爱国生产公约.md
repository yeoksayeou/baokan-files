    The Liberated Peasants of Xintian District, Yichun, Jiangxi Province, Establish Patriotic Production Pledges
    To the Editor:
    After the land reform movement and current affairs propaganda, the peasants of Xintian District, Yichun County, Jiangxi Province, have significantly improved their understanding of resisting America, aiding Korea, and protecting our homes and country. In current affairs discussion meetings, the old folks, both men and women, expressed their deep-seated hatred whenever they talked about the Japanese devils' invasion and the dark rule of the Kuomintang. In order to strengthen our economic power and consolidate national defense, the entire district has now established patriotic production pledges, stipulating practical content such as: (1) Guarantee that no one is idle and no land is left uncultivated. (2) Conscientiously improve production: paddy fields should be plowed three times, harrowed three times, and weeded four times; dry land should be plowed four times and harrowed four times; apply twenty loads of fertilizer per mu of land. (3) Organize mutual-aid groups to help the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers with farming. (4) Strictly supervise landlords and vagrants engaged in labor production. The peasants of Xintian Township in the district have newly built or repaired twenty ponds, which can irrigate more than 2,000 mu of land. All 4,500 mu of land in the township were plowed within seven days. Many peasants in Wujia Township and Antian Township in the district even dig up rice stubble in the moonlight. Peng Fujiu, a poor peasant in Qilijiang Village, goes to the fields early every morning and returns late at night. He told others, "We are working harder like this for our own good lives; at the same time, more grain will increase our strength to fight the American devils."

    江西宜春新田区的翻身农民
    订立了爱国生产公约编辑同志：
    江西省宜春县新田区的农民，经过土地改革运动和时事宣传以后，对抗美援朝保家卫国的认识有了显著的提高。在时事座谈会上，老俵们和老俵嫂们一谈到日本鬼子的侵略和国民党的黑暗统治，莫不切齿痛恨。为了增强经济力量，巩固国防，现在全区已订立了爱国生产公约，规定了切合实际的内容，如：（一）保证不闲一个人，不荒一亩地。（二）切实把生产搞好：水田三犁三耙四耘，旱田四犁四耙，每亩田上肥二十担。（三）组织代耕组帮助革命烈士家属、革命军人家属进行代耕。（四）严格监视地主、二流子从事劳动生产。该区新田乡农民已新筑或整修好二十个水塘，可以灌溉二千多亩地。全乡四千五百多亩地，七天内就全部犁开了。该区邬家乡、安田乡不少农民在月光下还要挖禾蔸（就是挖稻茬）。七里江村贫农彭富九每天清早下地，干到晚上才回来，他告诉别人说：“我们这样加紧干，为的是自己过好日子；同时多打了粮食，也就增加了打美国鬼子的力量。”
