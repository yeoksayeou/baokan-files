    Run Cooperative Warehouses Well to Open Up Sales Channels for Local Products

    To the Editor:

    Through our years of work in cooperative warehouses, we have deeply realized that opening up sales channels for local products is an effective way to increase farmers' purchasing power and also develop the business of the cooperatives themselves. Regarding the operation methods of cooperative warehouses, I would like to offer a few suggestions for reference by cooperative warehouses in various regions.

    (1) In the past, the local products transported from cooperative societies at all levels were often stored in warehouses first, and then sales channels were sought. However, if agreements or contracts are established with customers in advance, and the goods are directly transported to them, the handling costs of warehousing and unwarehousing can be reduced, and the cost of products can be lowered. This is very helpful in expanding sales. To do this well, cooperative warehouses should, according to the promotion and purchasing plans of each cooperative, sign purchase and sales contracts or agreements with public and private enterprises separately. This will not only reduce the backlog of goods but also ensure the good quality of the goods.

    (2) Develop trust business. According to the experience of the North China Cooperative Warehouse last year in using "mail purchase and mail sales" methods, various expenses and manpower for buyers to travel back and forth directly can be saved. For example, last year our warehouse (North China Cooperative Warehouse) had an average of 170 purchasing customers staying every day, some of whom had to stay for a long time. If the trust business is well developed, a large amount of these people's expenses can be saved, reducing the cost of goods.

    The development of trust business should also adopt a contract system to provide effective guarantees for the client (such as the quality, specifications, and delivery date of the goods). If the client suffers losses, the warehouse should bear certain responsibilities or provide compensation.

    (3) The staff of the warehouse should be proficient in business. In the past, some of our cadres were not familiar with the market situation, and sometimes sold cheap and bought expensive, causing losses to various cooperatives, and also affecting the development of the warehouse business.

### 办好合作货栈打开土产销路

    办好合作货栈打开土产销路编辑同志：
    我们在几年的合作货栈工作中，深深体会到打开土产的销路，是提高农民购买力的有效办法，同时也发展了合作社本身的业务。对合作货栈的经营方法，我愿提出几点意见供各地合作货栈参考。
    （一）在过去，从各级合作社运来的土产，多是先将货物入仓，再找销路。但如果在先即与顾主建立协议或订好合同，将货物直接运往，就可以减少出库入库的手续费用，降低产品的成本，这对扩大销路的作用是很大的。要作好这个工作，合作货栈应根据各社的推销与采购计划，分别与公私营企业，订立购销合同或协议，这样不但可以减少货物的积压，也可以保证货物质量好。
    （二）开展信托业务。根据华北合作货栈去年利用“函购、函销”的办法，可以节省购货人直接往返的各种费用和人力。如去年本栈（华北合作货栈）每天平均住有购货的客人一百七十来个，有的要住下来等很久。如果信托业务开展的好，这些人的大批费用都可节省下来，减低货物成本。
    开展信托业务也应采用合同制，以便给委托者有效的保证（如货物的质量、规格、交货日期等），如使委托者蒙受损失时，货栈应负有一定的责任或给予赔偿。
    （三）货栈的工作人员，应该精通业务。过去，我们有部分干部因不熟悉行情，时有贱卖贵买的事情发生，致使各合作社蒙受损失，同时也影响了货栈业务的开展。
