　　The Annihilation of a US Military Howitzer Battalion
　  ——A True Record of the Battle North of Hoengseong (3)
    By our reporter Tan Wenrui

    In the counterattack launched by our army in the area north of Hoengseong in mid-February, along with the US 2nd Infantry Division's 9th Regiment and the Li Seung-man's puppet army's 8th Division, the 15th Howitzer Battalion of the US 2nd Division was also annihilated. Except for the lieutenant colonel battalion commander and more than 50 officers and soldiers who were captured by a unit of our army, almost all the rest were killed. The battalion's eighteen 105mm howitzers, as well as a large number of machine guns, rocket launchers, submachine guns, trucks, jeeps and other light and heavy weapons and equipment, all became our spoils of war.

    The 15th Howitzer Battalion was one of the four artillery battalions of the US 2nd Infantry Division, with three combat batteries, one headquarters battery and one service battery, totaling about 600 officers and soldiers. The main weapons of the battalion were eighteen 105mm howitzers. During the Battle of Gunuri at the end of last November, this battalion had suffered a heavy blow from our Chinese People's Volunteers, but at that time, because they ran fast, a part of the people and cannons had escaped. After a period of rest and replenishment, at the end of January of this year, this artillery battalion was dispatched to the Hoengseong area again to support Li Seung-man's puppet army's 8th Division in combat. The headquarters battery and three combat batteries arrived at the area near Changfeng-ri, more than 20 li north of Hoengseong, on February 9th (the service battery stayed in Hoengseong and was later annihilated in the battle to liberate Hoengseong) and established positions, blindly bombarding north day and night in an attempt to cover the Li Seung-man's puppet army's incursions in front.

    At midnight on February 11th, the front and both flanks of the three batteries of the US military howitzer battalion were simultaneously attacked by the Chinese People's Volunteers. The "young master soldiers" who were sound asleep were awakened by the dense mortar and machine gun fire and responded in a panic. After firing a burst of howitzer shells, they failed to stop our army's increasingly approaching artillery fire. The enemy quickly realized that the entire battalion had been surrounded by our army. These American soldiers, scared out of their wits, hurriedly concentrated on the highway leading to Hoengseong, trying to retreat south. They still thought this road was their lifeline. Four or five hundred people and more than one hundred trucks and gun carriages formed a long snake, fleeing in a panic. The sounds of gunfire, artillery fire, car engines, and soldiers' screams...were a chaotic mess. They squeezed and jostled for less than two miles before discovering that this highway had been cut off by our army's blocking forces. At this time, dawn was approaching, and they thought that if they could break through this barrier, they would have a chance to survive. Because they believed that during the day, American planes could rescue them. So the American soldiers running in front abandoned a large number of weapons, trucks, and wounded soldiers, and stumbled and crawled over the roadblocks. However, the trucks they left behind blocked the highway, making it impossible for the troops behind to escape. Therefore, the American soldiers behind, who were afraid of death, had no choice but to rush to the mountains on both sides of the highway. However, the fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the mountain also descended like divine soldiers, blocking the enemy's path. At this time, the enemy only had one way out: to raise their hands and surrender to save their lives.

    Captain Paul Audu of the headquarters battery, recalling his capture, said: "I saw the troops collapse and ran into the mountains. After climbing for a long time, I was almost at the top of the mountain, and the sound of gunfire gradually faded away. I thought I had reached a safe area. Just as I was planning how to run back to our rear defense line, I suddenly heard Chinese People's Volunteers soldiers shouting loudly in front. I understood that they meant to tell me to hand over my gun and surrender. I had no other choice but to throw my pistol on the ground and raise my hands. Three Chinese People's Volunteers soldiers took me away. Later, I found out that the place where I was captured was only a few hundred yards away from their battalion headquarters. I really found it ridiculous, as if I was looking for them to surrender." Some other officers and soldiers were also taken prisoner under similar circumstances.

    Battalion Commander Lieutenant Colonel John Case's jeep driver was also killed by a bullet after the troops collapsed. So he fled for his life alone, running and scrambling. Later, he joined forces with fifty or sixty American and Li Seung-man's puppet army officers and soldiers and climbed mountains and ridges to flee south. They hid during the day and came out at night, groping blindly for more than ten miles for three or four days. At dawn on the 15th, when the sky was just slightly bright, this group of rabble, hungry and tired, walked to a farmhouse at the foot of a mountain, planning to rest and then move on. Before they approached the farmhouse, the Chinese People's Volunteers fighters on the hillside started firing machine guns. This sudden attack made this group of bandits, who were preparing to rob and steal, panic, but they still wanted to resist stubbornly. Before long, more than thirty of these defeated soldiers were killed or wounded. The rest, seeing that the situation was hopeless, had no choice but to surrender. Case said shamelessly: "If I had known this, I would have surrendered sooner. I am lucky that I not only did not lose my life, but also was not injured. Grenades exploded all around me!"

    Captain William Salley, the commander of the service battery, was one of the group of defeated soldiers who broke through the first roadblock (he was eager to rush back to Hoengseong to direct his subordinates to retreat). On the way, they encountered an attack by our ambushing troops. Grenades were thrown from the ditches on both sides of the highway. Trucks were blown up. The fleeing troops were cut off on the road. Machine guns rained down from the hillside. Groups of American soldiers died on or under the vehicles, and the rest desperately abandoned their trucks and howitzers to escape. But they could not escape the dragnet set up for them by the Chinese People's Volunteers. About twelve or thirteen miles away from the first roadblock was another strong roadblock. These defeated enemies suffered a devastating blow there. Salley, seeing that the situation was not right, hid on the side of the road. When the time was right, he automatically became a prisoner. Salley was a career soldier from West Point Military Academy, the "apple of heaven's eye" in the American army. After being captured, he expressed his sincere admiration for "the beautiful battles fought by the Chinese People's Volunteers." He said: "We are not suitable for fighting against an army like the Chinese People's Volunteers. We studied the military tactics of Napoleon and Hitler in military school, but we never learned about the strategies and tactics of the Volunteers. We value weapons too much, which is why we often suffer defeats." His mind seemed clearer than his commander MacArthur's, at least he understood that airplanes and cannons could not save the American invading army from its fate of defeat.

　　美军榴弹炮营的覆灭
　  ——横城以北歼灭战纪实之三
    本报记者　谭文瑞
    在二月中旬横城以北地区我军发动的反击战中，与美军第二师第九团及李承晚伪军第八师一同被歼灭的，还有美军第二师的第十五榴弹炮营。这一个独立炮兵营，除中校营长以下官兵五十余人被我军某部俘虏外，其余几乎全被击毙。该营的十八门一○五公厘榴弹炮以及大量的机关枪、火箭筒、冲锋枪、卡车、吉普车等轻重武器装备，都成了我们的战利品。
    第十五榴弹炮营是美军第二师的四个炮兵营之一，内有三个战斗连、一个营部连和一个勤务连，官兵共计六百人左右。该营主要的武器是十八门一○五公厘的榴弹炮。去年十一月底军隅里之役，这个营便曾受过我志愿军沉重的打击，不过当时因为他们跑得快，曾经漏网了一部分的人和炮。经过了一个时期的休整与补充后，在本年一月底，这个炮兵营又开到横城地区支助李承晚伪军第八师作战。营部连和三个战斗连于二月九日从原州开到横城以北二十多里的苍峰里附近地区（勤务连留在横城，后来在横城解放战中被歼）建立阵地，日夜向北盲目轰击，以图掩护前面的李承晚伪军窜扰。
    二月十一日午夜，美军榴弹炮营三个连的正面和两翼同时受到中国人民志愿军的袭击。正在酣睡中的“少爷兵”被密集的迫击炮和机关枪声惊醒，仓惶应战，打了一阵榴弹炮，并未能阻挡住我军愈益迫近的炮火。敌人很快地发觉全营已被我军包围。这些被吓得魂飞天外的美国兵便匆忙集中到通往横城的公路上，企图向南撤退。他们还以为这一条公路是他们的生路。四五百人、一百多辆卡车和炮车排成一条长蛇，狼狈逃窜。枪声、炮声、汽车马达声、士兵嚎叫声……乱成一团。他们挤挤拥拥走不到两里路，便发现这条公路已被我军的阻击部队截断了。这时已将拂晓，他们以为如果能突破这一关，便算有了活路。因为他们相信，到了白天，美国飞机就能搭救他们了。于是那些跑在前面的美国兵，抛下大量的武器、卡车和伤兵，连跌带爬地冲过路障。而他们遗下的卡车却堵塞了公路，使后面的部队无法逃命。因此，后面那些怕死的美国兵只好向公路两旁的山上乱窜。然而山上的中国人民志愿军的战士们也如神兵天降，拦住了敌人的去路；这时敌人只有一条路了，举手投降，保住性命。
    营部的上尉保罗·奥杜追述他被俘的经过说：“我看见部队溃散，便往山上逃跑。爬了好久，快到山顶了，枪炮声也逐渐疏远，我以为是到达了安全区域。当我正盘算怎样跑回我们后面的防线去的时候，突然听到前面有中国人民志愿军士兵大声喊话，我明白他们的意思是叫我缴枪投降。我没有别的选择，只好把手枪扔在地上，举起双手。三个中国人民志愿军士兵把我带走。后来我才发现我被俘的地方离他们的营部只有几百码，我真觉得可笑，好像我是找他们去投降似的。”别的一些官兵也是在和他相似的情形之下当了俘虏。
    营长约翰·凯斯中校在部队溃散之后，他的吉普车司机也中弹身死了。于是他连跑带窜地只身逃命。后来在路上会合了五六十名美军和李承晚伪军的官兵，便一块攀山越岭向南窜逃。他们昼伏夜出，三四天瞎摸了十几里路。十五日拂晓，天刚曚曚亮，这一伙乌合之众走得又饿?掷郏?醇?谏窖?屑讣沂杪涞呐┥帷Ｋ?谴蛩愕侥抢锴赖愠缘模?菹?休息再往前走。他们还未走近农舍，山坡上的中国人民志愿军战士便打起机关枪来了。这突如其来的袭击，使这群预备打家劫舍的匪徒惊惶失措，但是他们还想顽抗。不一会，这批败兵就死伤了三十多人，其余的看见大势已去，只好束手就擒。凯斯厚着脸皮说：“早知如此，不如早就投降。我总算幸运，不但没有丧命，而且没有受伤。手榴弹就在我的周围爆炸呀！”
    勤务连连长威廉·萨利上尉是冲过第一个路障的一伙败兵中的一个（他急着赶回横城去指挥他的部下撤退）。他们在路上遭遇到我埋伏部队的袭击，手榴弹从公路两旁的沟里投掷出来。卡车被炸坏了。逃亡的队伍被截在路上。机关枪从山坡上如雨一般打下来。一群一群的美国兵死在车上或车下，其余的都狼狈地抛掉卡车和榴弹炮逃命。但是他们逃不出中国人民志愿军给他们布置下的天罗地网。离第一个路障约十二、三里的地方，又是一个坚强的路障。这些溃敌就在那里遭到歼灭性的打击。萨利看见形势不对，躲在路旁，等到适当的时机到临，他就自动当了俘虏。萨利是美国西点军校出身的一个职业军人，是美国军队中的“天之骄子”。他被俘后表示衷心佩服“中国人民志愿军的仗打得漂亮”。他说：“我们是不宜于和中国人民志愿军这样的军队作战的。我们在军校时曾熟读从拿破仑到希特勒的兵法，但是从来没有学过志愿军这样的战略战术。我们太重视武器了，这就是为什么我们常常吃败仗的缘故。”他的脑筋似乎比他的统帅麦克阿瑟清楚一些，至少他懂得飞机大炮并不能挽救美国侵略军失败的命运。
