　　A Look at the Sources of American Soldiers From the Captured
　　By Our Correspondent Tan Wenrui
    After suffering heavy defeats in Korea, the warmongers Truman and MacArthur repeatedly clamored to commit more troops to Korea. However, they could not hide the major weakness of the American imperialists' depleted sources of soldiers. The American officers and soldiers recently captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fully exposed the plight of the American aggressors in terms of soldiers and manpower shortages.
    In the war of aggression against Korea, the losses of the American army were very great. The total number of American officers and soldiers killed in World War II was just over 270,000, while in the past nine months the number of American troops killed or wounded on the Korean battlefield has reached 100,000 (according to the New York Worker's Daily of March 4, quoting the New York Herald Tribune). For the United States, such troop losses are quite serious. Therefore, after several American divisions suffered devastating blows in Korea, they could not be replenished in a timely manner. Often the strength of a regiment was only equivalent to that of a battalion, and the number of men in a battalion was actually less than that of a company. Sometimes they had to collect South Korean conscripts to replenish their ranks. In several divisions, the proportion of South Korean soldiers reached more than one-third at its highest point. Melvin State, a company commander of the 23rd Regiment of the 2nd U.S. Division captured in the Battle of Hengcheng, said: "According to the U.S. military establishment, the number of officers and soldiers in a company should be about 225, but my company had only more than 50 people for a considerable period. Later, 50 South Korean soldiers were added, and recently it was replenished to 150 people."
    What do the American warmongers use to replenish the shortage of troops in the invading Korean army? On the one hand, they transfer soldiers from other troops, and on the other hand, they recruit new soldiers and reservists. "Without asking whether they can fight, as long as they can be cannon fodder." Boatload after boatload of replacements are shipped from across the Pacific, but what kind of soldiers are they? We can see the quality of these replacements from the prisoners captured recently.
    Private First Class Jacob Scott was a recent high school graduate. He was drafted into the army last October. After only one week of training, learning only how to shoot, he was sent to Korea to join the 3rd Company, 1st Battalion, 9th Regiment of the 2nd Division as an infantryman. After coming to Korea, he didn't even have the opportunity to fire a gun.
    Seventeen-year-old Private George Merenmalla was originally a bugler in the 3rd Division stationed in the United States. At the end of last December, he was transferred to Korea and assigned to the 5th Company, 21st Regiment, 24th Division as a machine gunner. He complained, "I thought they were going to transfer me to Tokyo, but who knew they would transfer me to Korea without any training. I am skilled at playing the trumpet, but I am really an amateur at firing a machine gun." He was captured in his first battle.
    Private First Class Oscar Booker of the 3rd Company, 9th Regiment of the 2nd Division is a black man who has been fascinated by cooking since he was a child. He aspired to become a famous chef many years ago, and once went to a specialized school to study, but dropped out due to financial difficulties. In order to make a living, he enlisted in the army last April and worked as a cook in a recruit training camp. After being transferred to Korea this January, he was ordered to use not dishes and pots, but rifles.
    Andrew Ross is an old mechanic who participated in World War II. After the war, he retired and worked as a technician in a machine factory. Because he was afraid of losing his job in the event of an economic crisis, he registered a name on the roster of reservists, but he had not received any benefits from the army for several years. Last November, he suddenly received a notice from the Department of the Army asking him to rejoin the army. At this time, he regretted it too late. When he returned to the army, he was not able to do his old job, and he also became an infantryman.
    Private First Class Frank Dillon of the 1st Company, 38th Regiment of the 2nd Division has severe nearsightedness. He enlisted in August 1945 in order to learn some radio technology. He served as a radio communicator in the army for a year and a half before retiring. After studying at university for three years, he was drafted last December. After only two weeks of training, he was sent to Korea to replenish the infantry shortage of the 2nd Division. I asked him, "How can you aim accurately with such strong glasses?" He shrugged and said, "God knows! They didn't want people like me to be infantrymen before, but you know they are desperately short of infantrymen now!"
    It is said that in the past, people with hemorrhoids in the United States could be exempted from military service, but now the old, weak, and disabled soldiers have been rounded up. Among these hundreds of prisoners, there are many who are extremely weak, and even many who have serious illnesses. For example, Corporal James Eyre of the 3rd Company, 19th Regiment of the 24th Division has suffered from severe anemia for many years; Corporal Robert Bannor of the 7th Company, 21st Regiment of the 24th Division is a patient with second-stage tuberculosis; and there are others with various chronic diseases such as gastric ulcers and chronic bronchitis. When they talked about their illnesses, they all complained that the Pentagon generals would not let them, the sick, go.
    The battered American invading army relies on these people to replenish and piece together their forces. Their low combat effectiveness is self-evident. The diary of Sergeant Clement Petrasvitz of the 11th Company, 23rd Regiment of the 2nd Division is a very interesting self-satire:
        "January 20 Landed in Busan.
        January 21 Waiting for assignment.
        January 22 Headed to the front.
        January 23 Reported to the company.
        January 28 Went out for search.
        January 29 Captured."
    Petrasvitz was a newly arrived replacement, and his vacancy needs to be filled by a new replacement.

### 从俘虏看美国兵源

　　从俘虏看美国兵源
    本报记者  谭文瑞
    美国侵略军在朝鲜连续遭受了惨重失败之后，杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟之流的战争贩子们曾一再叫嚣要在朝鲜投入更多的兵力，但是他们无法掩饰美国帝国主义兵源枯竭的重大弱点。最近期间被我人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军俘虏的美军官兵，充分暴露了美国侵略者兵穷人缺的窘态。
    在侵朝战争中，美国军队的损失是很大的。第二次世界大战美军官兵阵亡的总数仅近二十七万余，而过去九个月来美国在朝鲜战场上军队的死伤人数已达十万人（按系三月四日纽约工人日报引自纽约先驱论坛报）。对于美国来说，这样的兵员损耗是相当严重的。因此在朝鲜作战的美军几个师遭受歼灭性打击以后，都无法得到及时的补充。常常一个团的兵力只相当于一个营，一个营的人数实际上还不足一个连。有时候他们就只好搜罗南朝鲜的壮丁来补充。有几个师，南朝鲜士兵所占的比例数，最高时曾到过三分之一以上。在横城战役被俘的美军第二师二十三团的一个连长梅尔文·史泰说：“按美军的编制，一个连的官兵人数应该是二百二十五人左右，但是我的那个连，在一个相当长的期间中只有五十多个人，后来一度增添了五十名南朝鲜士兵，最近才补充到一百五十人。”
    美国的战争贩子们拿什么来补充侵朝军队的缺额呢？一方面从其他的部队抽调士兵，一方面征召新兵和后备人员。“不问能否打仗，只要可当炮灰。”一船一船的补充兵是从太平洋的彼岸运来了，但是他们都是些什么样子的士兵呢？我们从最近捉获的俘虏中可以看出这些补充兵的素质来。
    上等兵杰柯普·司考德是个中学刚毕业的学生，去年十月被征入伍，受了一个星期的训练，只学会怎样开枪，便被派到朝鲜来补充进第二师九团一营第三连当步兵。他到朝鲜来以后，还没有机会放过枪。
    十七岁的下等兵乔治·麦伦玛拉，本来是驻在美国国内第三师的一个号手，去年十二月底被调到朝鲜来，编到二十四师二十一团第五连当机关枪手。他抱怨说：“我还以为他们要把我调到东京去，谁知道也没有经过训练就把我调到朝鲜来。吹喇叭我是熟练的，开机关枪则实在外行。”他在打头一仗就当了俘虏。
    第二师九团第三连的一等兵奥斯卡·布克尔是一个自小醉心烹调的黑人，他许多年前就立志要成为一个名厨师，曾经进过专门学校去学习，后来因为经济困难中辍；为了生活，于去年四月入伍，在新兵训练营中当炊事员。今年一月被调来朝鲜后，他被命令使用的竟不是菜和锅，而是来福枪。
    安德鲁·罗斯是曾经参加过第二次世界大战的一个老机械士，战后退伍，在一家机械厂里当技工。他因为恐怕经济危机来临时失业，就在后备人员的名册上登记了一个名字，但是几年来没有从军队里得过什么好处。到去年十一月突然接到陆军部的通知，要他重新入伍，这时他已后悔莫及。他回到军队，并没有能干他的老本行，他也成了一个步兵。
    第二师三十八团第一连的上等兵法兰克·狄伦有着很深度的近视，他在一九四五年八月入伍，为的是要学点无线电的技术，在军队里当了一年半的无线电通信兵便退伍了。在大学里念了三年书，去年十二月被征召，只受了两周的训练，就被派来朝鲜补充第二师的步兵缺额。我问他：“你戴着这样深度的近视眼镜，打枪怎能瞄得准？”他耸耸肩说：“天晓得！在以前他们是不要像我这样的人当步兵的，但是你知道现在他们缺步兵缺得要命呀！”
    据说从前在美国长痔疮的人也可以免役的，但如今老弱残兵都被搜罗来了。在这几百名俘虏中就有许多是体质极为衰弱的，甚至有不少身有重病。像二十四师十九团第三连的伍长詹姆士·艾尔多年来就患着严重的贫血症；二十四师二十一团第七连的伍长罗拔·班诺尔则是个第二期肺结核病患者；另外还有患胃溃疡、慢性气管炎等各种痼疾的。当他们谈到自己的病时，莫不异口同声埋怨五角大楼的将军们连他们这样的病号也不放过。
    被打得焦头烂额的美国侵略军就是依靠这些人来补充拼凑的。他们的战斗力之低是不言而喻的。第二师二十三团第十一连的中士克里蒙·皮特拉斯维兹的日记是很有趣的自我讽刺：
        “一月二十日  在釜山登陆。
        二十一日  等待分派。
        二十二日  开赴前线。
        二十三日  到连队报到。
        二十八日  出动搜索。
        二十九日  被俘。”
    皮特拉斯维兹是个新来的补充兵，而他的空缺又有待新的补充兵去补充了。
