Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: Workers in the German Democratic Republic are preparing to grandly celebrate this year's International Labor Day, May 1st. Grand parades and demonstrations will be held in Berlin and other cities. In a resolution issued by the Presidium of the Free German Trade Union Federation for this purpose, it was pointed out that this year's May Day celebration should first be held under the banner of intensifying the struggle for peace. The most important task is to prepare to launch a signature campaign to strive for the eradication of West German militarism, convene an all-German constitutional conference, and conclude a peace treaty by the five major powers.

　　In order to greet this great festival of the working class, workers in various parts of the German Democratic Republic have begun a production emulation drive and are formulating individual and collective plans to increase production. The 3,000 workers of the Electrochemical Factory in Bitterfeld City have guaranteed to complete the April production plan before April 22nd, the anniversary of Lenin's birth. The workers of the "Marx" foundry in Winterwielenborn have already overfulfilled the production plan for the first quarter of this year: cast iron production completed 102 percent of the original plan, raw steel completed 103 percent, and rolled steel completed 115 percent. On the eve of May Day, the government of the German Democratic Republic will award medals to the most outstanding shock workers.

　　德意志民主共和国工人筹备庆祝“五一”节
    许多工厂开始生产运动
    【新华社十二日讯】据电通社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国工人正准备盛大庆祝今年的“五一”国际劳动节。届时，在柏林与各个城市都将举行盛大的游行示威。德意志民主共和国自由工会联合会主席团在为此发出的决议中指出：今年的“五一”，首先是要在加紧为争取和平而斗争的旗帜下举行庆祝。最重要的任务，是准备为争取肃清西德军国主义，召开全德立宪会议及五大国缔结和平公约而发动签名运动。
    为了迎接这个工人阶级的伟大节日，德意志民主共和国各地工人已开始了生产竞赛运动，并且正在订出个人的与集体的增加生产的计划。比特菲尔德城的电气化学工厂的三千名工人保证在四月二十二日——列宁诞辰以前，完成四月份的生产计划。温特维伦勃恩地方的“马克思”翻砂厂工人已经超额完成今年第一季的生产计划：铣铁生产完成了原定计划的百分之一百零二，原钢完成了百分之一百零三，辗钢完成了百分之一百一十五。在“五一”节前夕，德意志民主共和国政府将颁发奖章给最优秀的突击工人。
