In the Xi'an area, rain began on the evening of the 15th and stopped on the afternoon of the 17th, totaling two days of rain. The rainfall was heavier on the night of the 16th, and the ground has been thoroughly moistened. In the Zhengzhou area of Henan, a drizzle fell all day on the 17th, and on the 18th, rain fell again for about two hours from 12:00 AM to 3:00 PM, wetting the ground to a depth of about four fingers.

　　西安郑州喜雨
    【本报讯】沿陇海线开封以西广大地区春雨初降，越往西去雨越大。西安地区十五日晚开始落雨，至十七日下午停止，共落雨两天，十六日夜间雨量较大，地面已下透墒。河南郑州一带十七日细雨落了一整天，十八日上午十二时至下午三时以前又落雨两小时许，地面已湿约四指深。今春各地缺少雨水，这次雨对春耕种棉和麦苗有很大好处。
