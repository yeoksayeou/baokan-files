Pingyuan Province's Advanced Experience in Dike Construction

　　Today's newspaper carries a report on the Yellow River spring repair project. In this year's Yellow River spring repair project in Pingyuan Province, under a very enthusiastic competition movement, the earthwork efficiency has generally increased to 4 to 6 cubic meters of earth moved per person per day; many people moved more than 10 cubic meters of earth per day; and the highest individual record reached 53 cubic meters. As the national water conservancy spring repair project unfolds on a large scale, this is a very important message that should be given full attention by water conservancy agencies at all levels across the country. Because according to the reports from various regions at last year's national water conservancy conference, although there were many outstanding hero models with daily earthmoving achievements of 10 to 46 cubic meters, the general work efficiency was only around 2 to 3 cubic meters, and in some areas it did not even reach this standard. Therefore, when the national water conservancy conference last year set the standard for earthwork unit prices this year, the estimation of the daily work efficiency of migrant workers was also roughly calculated at 2 cubic meters of earth moved per person per day. Now, the work efficiency in Pingyuan Province has generally increased by more than double, which is a very significant progress. This progress prompts our water conservancy agencies at all levels to pay attention to studying the experience of Pingyuan, and should reconsider the following questions: Is there a conservative tendency in our past estimates of migrant workers' work efficiency? Are there any shortcomings in the leadership of the spring repair project, so that the work potential of migrant workers has not been fully utilized?

　　In the past construction of water conservancy projects in various regions, there has always been a common and noteworthy phenomenon, that is, the amazing and outstanding achievements of labor models and the disparity between their work efficiency and that of ordinary migrant workers. There may be two opposite explanations for this phenomenon: One possible explanation is that the hero models we select are only people who are particularly superior in physical strength, and ordinary migrant workers cannot reach the same level; another possible explanation is that most of our current water conservancy projects are manual labor using simple tools, and the migrant workers participating in the project are ordinary laboring peasants, and even if there are differences in physical strength, there will not be a great disparity. Therefore, since labor models can achieve 10 to 46 cubic meters, there must still be great potential for improving the efficiency of ordinary migrant workers. The current disparity between the efficiency of labor models and ordinary migrant workers may be that we have not fully utilized the work potential of migrant workers in the leadership of migrant workers. Although the above two opposing views existed in the past, they were not explicitly raised, formally discussed, and resolved in practice through actual experiments. Now, the large-scale improvement of general work efficiency in Pingyuan Province proves that the latter view may be the correct one, which advances our understanding of this issue. As for the main experience of Pingyuan Province in achieving such results, the following noteworthy points are worth mentioning:

　　According to the experience of Pingyuan, the first key to generally improving work efficiency is to thoroughly break the traditional influence of the historical "corvée system" and "conscription system" on migrant workers for thousands of years, and truly inspire the labor enthusiasm of the masses. In the old society, the historical corvée system and conscription system were compulsory labor, forcing the masses to do work that was unrelated to themselves, without paying wages at all, only providing meals, and even the meals were not guaranteed to be full. Therefore, "go slow" was the general situation under the conscription system. This historical and traditional impression has a deep-rooted and difficult-to-remove influence in the minds of peasants. Now, our mobilization of the masses to carry out water conservancy projects is for the sake of the masses' own vital interests, which is of course fundamentally different from the past corvée and conscription. However, if we cannot thoroughly break this traditional influence from the perspective of propaganda and education and the work system, the idea of "working for the government and eating government food" will still become a major obstacle to improving work efficiency. When carrying out the water conservancy spring repair project last year, the Central Water Conservancy Department had already proposed a wage system based on payment per cubic meter, and advocated that the masses freely form groups to directly contract for the project. This year's national water conservancy spring repair project, because the wage standard is relatively low, has some characteristics of voluntary labor. The Water Conservancy Department in the spring repair instructions also especially emphasized that propaganda work must be done in advance to inspire the masses' conscious willingness; it especially emphasized that the wage system of payment per cubic meter must be implemented to ensure more pay for more work, and work completion and clear accounts, and opposed payment by the day or any tendency towards egalitarianism, in order to avoid confusion with the conscription system. All of these are measures proposed to break this traditional influence. Now, the work in Pingyuan has made significant achievements in this regard. The main method of mobilizing migrant workers in Pingyuan this year is to launch the masses to contract for the project on a voluntary basis, and conscientiously implement the wage system of "payment per cubic meter, whoever does it gets paid, more work gets more pay." This allows the masses to thoroughly understand that dike construction is for their own benefit, and that working is also equivalent to sideline production, and the long-term interests and current interests are completely combined, which will naturally completely eliminate the old "conscription" impression. This method was first advocated by the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission in 1949, and was first tried out in Pingyuan Province. However, because the organization and mobilization work was more detailed and complex, it was not widely and deeply implemented, so although there were achievements, they were not widespread. This year, this system has shown significant results and is worth introducing and promoting to various regions.

　　The second noteworthy feature of the Yellow River spring repair experience in Pingyuan Province is that the labor competition movement has developed from the reward of individual achievements to the improvement of general achievements. Because earthwork projects are mainly individual labor, it is a necessary process to first reward outstanding individual achievements in the competition movement, but the ultimate result of the movement must be to improve the overall work efficiency, which is considered to have achieved the true purpose of the competition. In this direction of development, there are many methods in the competition movement in Pingyuan Province that are worth learning from and promoting. In the movement to improve work efficiency, the main ideological obstacle for migrant workers is being bound by local and partial experience. They do not believe that their efficiency can be improved, nor do they believe in the outstanding achievements of hero models. In the competition in Fan County, Pingyuan, the method of "hero meeting" was adopted, in which each district selected its own players to participate in the competition demonstration, which played a great role in eliminating the doubts of migrant workers. In addition, in areas such as Juancheng, labor models initiated competitions between groups and teams, which played an important role in expanding the scope of the competition, stimulating the enthusiasm of the competition, and improving work efficiency. In the competition in Pingyuan, some women's teams also achieved high efficiency, which is especially worthy of our attention.

　　The third noteworthy issue in the Yellow River spring repair experience in Pingyuan is the length of the construction period and the coordination of spring repair and spring plowing. There have been two different approaches to dealing with this issue in the past. One method is to have a short construction period and mobilize a large number of people to complete the spring repair project in a concentrated manner in order to avoid delaying spring plowing. The advantage of this method is that the organization and mobilization procedures are simple and easily accepted by the masses; the disadvantage is that the construction period is too short, and the shifts are changed too frequently. After each shift of migrant workers goes to work, it takes a period of time to arrange their lives and familiarize themselves with the work, which reduces the overall work efficiency. Another method is to do a good job in the mutual assistance organization of spring repair and spring plowing, mobilize less manpower, and work for a longer period of time, in order to simplify the management of the project and improve the efficiency of the work. The advantage of this method is that there are no shifts or fewer shifts, no time is wasted, and the overall work efficiency is higher; the difficulty is that the mutual assistance organization procedures are more complicated, and if it is not done well, the migrant workers will inevitably have concerns. This year's Yellow River spring repair in Pingyuan Province has noteworthy experience with both of these methods. This year's general method of mobilizing migrant workers in Pingyuan Province is to adopt the former method, with a shorter construction period. However, it has a remedial measure, which is to complete all preparatory work through contract labor, signing contracts, and other procedures before the start of construction. Therefore, the competition can be launched as soon as construction starts, thus avoiding all the shortcomings of the first method. Regarding the latter method, this year a part of the counties in Pingyuan Province selected capable people and organized specialized engineering teams to contract for river work. Because the work is technically proficient and efficient, the income of migrant workers can not only compensate for the losses caused by leaving production, but also, according to estimates, if further developed in the future, less manpower can be used to solve the task of dike construction throughout the province. Although this method cannot be universally implemented at present, from the perspective of the trend of national economic development, the economy is becoming increasingly prosperous, and the total labor force will inevitably gradually feel a lack, rather than a surplus. Mobilizing such a huge amount of manpower every year to carry out dike construction will be uneconomical in the future. Therefore, organizing a skilled engineering team to complete a larger task with fewer people, and gradually moving from simple manual labor to mechanization in terms of tools and technology, are the inevitable directions of future development, and are also worth mentioning in passing.

　　The above is our preliminary analysis of Pingyuan's work experience. Because spring repair projects are related to many conditions, these specific experiences may only provide reference for researching and improving work in other regions, and cannot be completely and directly adopted. However, the general and large-scale improvement of work efficiency in this year's dike construction in Pingyuan Province is a highly persuasive fact. It proves that work efficiency can be improved and can be improved. This year's national river work, just earthwork alone, amounts to more than 400 million cubic meters. Assuming the work efficiency is 2 cubic meters per person per day, if 4 million migrant workers are mobilized, it will take 50 consecutive working days, which means 200 million workdays. If the work efficiency can be improved to 4 cubic meters per person per day, then 400 million cubic meters of earth, mobilized by 4 million people, will be enough for 25 working days, which is 100 million workdays. This will have a huge impact on the country's economic construction. Therefore, the responsible agencies of national water conservancy projects should pay attention to this fact, study the experience of Pingyuan, and check their own work, mobilize themselves, and strive to generally improve work efficiency.

### 平原省修堤的先进经验

　　平原省修堤的先进经验
    今日本报刊载一条关于黄河春修工程的报道，平原省今年黄河春修工程，在十分热烈的竞赛运动之下，土工效率，一般提高到每人每日运土四至六立方公尺；每日运土十立方公尺以上者非常众多；个人最高成绩达五十三立方公尺。在全国水利春修工程大规模展开的时候，这是一个非常重要的消息，应该引起全国各级水利机关的充分注意。因为根据去年全国水利会议各地区的报告，各地土工效率，虽然有许多突出的英雄模范，一日运土成绩达到十立方公尺至四十六立方公尺，可是一般的工作效率，总是在二至三立方公尺左右，个别地区甚且达不到这个标准。因而去年全国水利会议规定今年土工单价的标准时，对于民工每人每日工作效率的估计，也是大体上按每人每日运土二立方公尺计算的。现在平原省的工作效率，普遍提高一倍以上，这是一个非常重大的进步。这一个进步，促使我们各级水利机关必须注意研究平原的经验，并且应该重新考虑下面的问题：便是过去我们对于民工工作效率的估计，是否存在着保守的倾向？对于春修工程的领导，是否存在某些缺点，以致没有充分发挥民工的工作潜力？
    在过去各地水利工程施工的情况中，一直存在一个普遍的值得注意的现象，便是劳动模范们的惊人的突出的成绩，及其与一般民工工作效率的悬殊。这现象可能有两种相反的解释：一种可能的解释，是认为我们所选拔的英雄模范，只是在体力上特别优越的人物，一般民工不可能达到同样的水准；另一种可能的解释，则认为我们现在的水利工程，多数是利用简单工具的体力劳动，参加工程的民工都是一般的劳动农民，体力强弱纵有差别，也不会有极大的悬殊，因此，劳动模范既然能做到十至四十六立方公尺，则一般民工的效率的提高，一定还存在很大的可能。目前劳动模范与一般民工效率的悬殊，可能是我们在民工的领导上，还没有充分发挥民工的工作潜力。以上这两种对立的看法，过去虽然存在，却没有明确提出，展开正式的讨论，并用实际的试验在实践中加以解决。现在平原省一般工作效率的大量提高，证明后一种看法可能是正确的看法，使我们对于这个问题的了解，向前推进了一步。至于平原省所以能够获得这样成绩的主要经验，则有以下一些值得注意的要点：
    根据平原的经验，要普遍提高工作效率，其第一个要点，是必须彻底打破几千年来历史的“徭役制度”“征工制度”所加于民工的传统的影响，以真正启发群众的劳动热忱。在旧社会中，历来的徭役制度征工制度，都是强制性的劳动，强迫群众去做和自己无关的工作，根本不发工资，仅只管饭，甚至饭也不肯管饱，因此“磨洋工”是征工制度下一般的情况。这个历史的传统的印象，在农民心里，具有根深蒂固、不易拔除的影响。现在我们动员群众进行水利工程，是为了群众自己切身的利益，当然和过去的徭役征工有根本不同的区别，可是若不能从宣传教育上、和工作制度上彻底打破这个传统的影响，则“做官工，吃官饭”的思想，仍然会成为妨害提高工作效率的主要障碍。去年进行水利春修工程时，中央水利部已经提出按方给资的工资制度，并提倡由群众自由组合，直接包做工程。今年全国水利春修工程，因为工资标准较低，带有一部分义务劳动性质，水利部在春修指示中，又特别强调事前要做好宣传工作，以启发群众的自觉自愿；特别强调必须实行按方给资的工资制度，保证多做多得，和工完账清，反对计日工资或任何平均主义的倾向，以避免混同于征工制度，都是针对要打破这个传统的影响而提出的办法，现在平原的工作，正是在这方面做出了显著的成绩。平原今年动员民工的主要方式，是发动群众在自愿的基础上进行包工，并认真执行“按方给资、谁做谁得、多做多得”的工资制度，这样可使群众彻底了解，修堤是为了自己的利益，做工亦等于副业生产，长远的利益和目前的利益得到完全的结合，自然就会彻底消除旧日的“征工”的印象。这个办法黄河水利委员会在一九四九年已开始提倡，并在平原省首先试行，不过因为组织动员的工作较为细致复杂，未能普遍深入的执行，所以虽有成绩，却未普遍，今年这个制度已经表现出显著的成效，值得向各地介绍推广。
    平原省黄河春修经验值得注意的第二个特点，是劳动竞赛运动，从个人成绩的奖励，发展到普遍成绩的提高。因为土方工程主要是个人劳动，在竞赛运动中首先奖励突出的个人成绩，是必经的过程，但是运动的最后结果，必须归结到全体工作效率的普遍提高，才算达到了竞赛的真正目的。在这个发展的方向上，平原省的竞赛运动中，有很多方式是值得取法推广的。在提高工作效率的运动中，民工思想上的主要障碍，是受地方局部经验的束缚，不相信自己的效率可以提高，也不相信英雄模范的突出成绩。在平原范县的竞赛中，采用“群英会”的办法，由各区推选自己的选手，参加竞赛示范，对消除民工的怀疑，作用很大。另外鄄城等地，由劳动模范发起组与组、队与队的竞赛，对于扩大竞赛的范围，挑起竞赛的热潮，提高工作效率，有重要的作用。在平原的竞赛中，有些妇女组成的组队也获得高度的效率，尤其值得我们注意。
    平原黄河春修经验值得注意的第三个问题，是工期长短和春修与春耕的配合问题。对于这个问题的处理，过去存在两种不同的做法，一种办法是工期短，动员的人数多，突击完成春修工程，以求不误春耕。这个办法的好处是组织动员的手续简单，容易为群众所接受；坏处是工期过短，换班过勤，每一班民工上工之后，都要费去一段安排生活、熟悉工作的时间，总的工作效率因而减低。另一个办法是做好春修与春耕的互助组织，动员较少的人力，工作较长的期限，以简化工程的管理，提高工作的效率。这个办法的好处，是不换班或少换班，时间没有浪费，总的工作效率较高，困难则是互助的组织手续比较复杂，若做不好，则民工思想必有顾虑。今年平原省黄河春修，对这两种办法都有值得注意的经验。今年平原省动员民工一般的办法，是采取前一种办法，工期较短。可是它有一个补救的办法，便是在开工以前，通过包工订合同等等手续，把各项准备工作酝酿到十分成熟。所以一开工就可以展开竞赛，因而避免了第一种办法所有的缺点。关于后一种办法，平原省今年有一部分县段，选拔精干，组织了专门包做河工的工程队，因为工作的技术熟练，效率较高，不但民工收入可以补偿脱离生产所受的损失，并且根据估计，将来若加发展，可用较少的人力，解决全省修堤的任务。这个办法就现在说，虽然还不能普遍实行，但是就国家经济发展的趋势来看，工农业日趋繁荣，总的劳动力将来必然会逐渐感觉缺乏，而不是感觉剩余，每年动员如此巨大的人力进行修堤工程，将来会是不经济的事情，因此组织精干的工程队，以较少的人数，完成较大的任务，同时在工具与技术上，逐渐由简单的体力劳动，走向机械化的道路，都是将来发展的必然的方向，也值得附带提出。
    以上是我们对于平原的工作经验的初步的分析。因为春修工程所联系的条件很多，所以这些具体经验对于其他地区，也许只可提供研究改进工作的参考，而不能完全直接的采用。但是平原省今年修堤的工作效率普遍的大量的提高，则是具有极强的说服能力的事实。它证明了工作效率是能够提高，可以提高的。今年全国河工，仅土工一项，即达四万万多公方，假设工作效率为每人每天做二公方，如动员四百万民工，就要连续做五十个工作日，也就是说要用二万万个工，如果能将工作效率提高到每人每天做四公方，则四万万公方土，动员四百万人，有二十五个工作日即一万万个工就够了，这对国家的经济建设，将发生极大的作用，所以全国水利工程的负责机关，应当重视这一个事实，研究平原的经验，并检查自己的工作，动员起来，为普遍提高工作效率而奋斗。
