The finance of special districts and counties (cities) shall be included in the provincial finance. The rural finance of counties (cities) shall be separately budgeted and not included in the provincial budget.

Hereafter, without a formal order from the State Administration Council or the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Administration Council, no more will be received.
