    Comrade Yuan Xinshan,
    CPC Anyang Suburban District Committee
    Resolves to Strive to Study and Improve Political Level

    Editor,
    After reading the article "Some Cadres in Anyang City Are Not Concerned About Current Events, and Their Political Understanding Lags Behind the Masses" published in your newspaper on February 17th, I conducted a self-examination and exchanged views with comrades from the CPC Anyang Suburban District Committee. I am now writing down the situation at the time and my self-criticism:

    Last December, when Anyang City suburbs launched current affairs propaganda on resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country, it was closely integrated with the autumn grain collection work. When this work was arranged, although it was verbally emphasized that the autumn grain collection task should be completed through current affairs propaganda, in the specific implementation, due to the task-oriented view of the autumn grain collection work in ideology, the current affairs propaganda work was not carried out thoroughly enough. In particular, no attention was paid to summarizing experience to promote the overall movement. This shows that I am not learning new things and new ideas enough.

    After the liberation of Pyongyang in Korea, suburban women cadres launched a fundraising campaign for women to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army who were fighting bloody battles in Korea. At that time, I did not provide specific help to the women's patriotic practical actions, thinking that this was the work of the women cadres and had nothing to do with me. In addition to deeply examining myself, I will strive to study hard and improve my political and ideological level in the future.

          Yuan Xinshan
          CPC Anyang Suburban District Committee, Pingyuan Province

    中共安阳市郊区委员会原馨山
    决心努力学习提高政治水平编辑同志：
    我看到贵报二月十七日登载《安阳市部分干部不关心时事，政治认识落后于群众》一稿后，曾进行了检查，并和中共安阳市郊区区委同志们交换了意见。现将当时的情况和我的检查写在下面：
    去年十二月安阳市郊区在开展抗美援朝保家卫国时事宣传中，紧密结合了秋征工作。当布置这一工作时，虽然在口头上强调提出了通过时事宣传完成秋征任务，但在具体执行中，由于思想上对秋征工作抱有任务观点，因而时事宣传工作就作得不够深入。特别是没有注意总结经验推动全面运动。这说明自己对学习新的事物和新的思想非常不够。
    当朝鲜平壤解放以后，郊区妇女干部为了慰问在朝鲜浴血奋战的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，发动妇女进行募捐。当时我对妇女们这种爱国的实际行动，没有去具体帮助，认为这是妇女干部的工作，与自己无关。我除了深刻检讨以外，今后当努力学习，提高自己的政治和思想水平。
