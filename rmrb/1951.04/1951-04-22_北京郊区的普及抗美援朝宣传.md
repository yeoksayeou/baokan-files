　　Popularizing Resist America, Aid Korea Propaganda in the Suburbs of Beijing
　　Jin Feng
　　From April 5th to 10th, Beijing organized over 11,700 teachers, students, and staff from 28 universities and middle schools to utilize their spring break and, in coordination with thousands of district and village cadres and activists in the suburbs, conducted widespread Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education among 150,000 households. Approximately 600,000 farmers in 252 out of 255 administrative villages in the entire suburban area received Resist America, Aid Korea education. Farmers in 106 villages signed patriotic pacts, proposing specific tasks such as exposing spies, joining the militia, and organizing to overcome production difficulties. About half of the farmers signed the World Peace Council's declaration on concluding a peace pact and held a vote against the United States arming Japan.
　　This propaganda effort proved that in rural areas where Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education had been relatively poor, it was necessary to organize organized masses from schools and factories to conduct a large-scale propaganda and education campaign in conjunction with local cadres. This not only solved the difficulty of insufficient propaganda forces in rural areas, but also enabled the peasant masses to gain a preliminary understanding of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and cultivate a group of local propaganda backbones in the movement, creating favorable conditions for regular Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda in rural areas in the future.
　　One of the experiences of this Beijing suburban propaganda campaign was to focus on opposing the United States' arming of Japan as the center of the propaganda, starting with the atrocities of the Japanese bandits and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, leading from hatred of Japan to hatred of the United States, and forming a mass anti-American patriotic movement. The suburban farmers had suffered greatly under the Japanese imperialists, spies, and local bullies. In Qinghe Town, with a population of 4,000, more than 400 people were killed by the Japanese bandits. Among them, more than 100 people were split to death or buried alive with shovels by spies Li Yongming and Li Tiebao. Therefore, when the masses in Qinghe Town saw the propaganda posters of the Japanese bandits' atrocities on the walls, they knew that Japan must not be rearmed. When the propaganda team mentioned the Japanese spies Li Yongming and Li Tiebao, who were recently shot in Qinghe, the residents of Qinghe, regardless of men, women, old or young, were all beaming and talking vividly.
　　How to shift farmers from hatred of Japan to hatred of the United States was a major key issue in this propaganda campaign. Some propaganda teams talked about the "Three Alls Policy" of the Japanese bandits, which was familiar to the suburban farmers, to the "New Three Alls Policy" of the American imperialists in Korea, making the farmers realize that "all imperialists in the world are cannibals." Some propaganda teams showed in theatrical performances that the American imperialists handed guns to the Japanese bandits. As soon as the farmers saw it, they shouted, "The American devils handed the knife handle to the Japanese devils, wanting them to come and ruin us again, but we can't let them come again!" They said, "It turns out that the backstage boss of Japan is the United States. The American bandits are even more evil than the Japanese bandits." Therefore, when voting on the Japan issue, the farmers in Mentougou raised their hands, and the women in the 15th district held up their children to express their firm will to oppose the United States arming Japan.
　　Another experience of this propaganda campaign is that the propaganda teams composed of district and village cadres and students and workers implemented a propaganda responsibility system, which has been proven effective. The advantage of such a propaganda team is that the students and workers who go to the countryside are more aware of current affairs and can grasp the general content of propaganda and various propaganda methods; the district and village cadres understand the local situation and are good at approaching and organizing the masses. They cooperate and improve each other.
　　In this propaganda campaign, the vast majority of leading cadres in the suburbs of Beijing were mobilized. Each district held special cadre meetings to deploy the work and divided the responsible areas for popularization. The district committees of the Communist Party of China in each district and the general负责人 of the propaganda teams of each school formed a general headquarters to jointly formulate the propaganda plan for the district and supervise and inspect its implementation. The district cadres went to each village to assist the village cadres in cooperating with the propaganda teams of each school to carry out propaganda. The propaganda teams and propaganda groups distributed to each village and each 闾 implemented a "propaganda responsibility system" to ensure that the residents of the areas under their jurisdiction were universally educated in Resist America, Aid Korea, which fully utilized the enthusiasm and creativity of each propagandist and local cadre. Five students from Tsinghua University were responsible for the propaganda of Caoxiao Village, which has more than 200 households. They visited more than 100 households in three days and organized a propaganda parade. They walked in front with an accordion and carrying comic strip boards, followed by a team of elementary school students, which publicized to more than 200 residents.
　　The third experience of this propaganda campaign proves that small propaganda teams, small performances, and small discussion meetings—speaking bitterness meetings—are good organizational forms and propaganda methods that adapt to the dispersed characteristics of rural areas and popularize Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda. Generally, farmers like visualized propaganda. In the past, student propaganda teams going to the countryside often also equipped themselves with performing arts teams, performing programs with political content, which were very popular among the masses. The disadvantage was that there were too few performing arts teams, which were difficult to popularize. This time, the schools that went to the countryside formed many small propaganda teams, distributed in each village. Each member of the propaganda team can master a propaganda skill, conduct family visits and convene discussion meetings separately; when gathered together, they can do small performances—including dramas, live reports, clapper talks, cross talks, magic lanterns, yangko operas, slides, etc. For example, the two propaganda teams of Tsinghua University in Fengtai and Changxindian, with 120 people, publicized to 27,000 people in three days, an average of 225 people publicized by one person. The propaganda team collected local materials and sang real people and real events, which was more popular among the masses. The propaganda team of Dajing Village performed the situation of a resident of the village being dug out and buried alive by the Japanese devils, and the stage and audience were crying together.
　　These small performances generally solved the problem of popularizing propaganda. Small discussion meetings often developed into small accusation meetings, which can further improve the political consciousness of the masses. Only the propaganda teams of eleven universities such as Peking University convened 1,763 small discussion meetings of various types in various villages and towns, with more than 100,000 participants. At these meetings, the propaganda teams used the method of recalling and comparing to inspire the masses to make accusations, using bitterness to lead to bitterness, so that the masses hated the United States from hatred of Japan.
　　Finally, this propaganda also provided some experience in establishing local propaganda teams to ensure the regularity of Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda.
　　This large-scale Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic propaganda in the suburbs of Beijing educated the masses and, even more, the district and village cadres. Through this propaganda movement, Jiugong Village in the 11th District organized a propaganda team including the village chief, 闾 chief, resident sanitation group leader, party and league members, primary school teachers, people's school teachers, and students. After the school propaganda team left the village, they continued to carry out Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda in the village in conjunction with the election of the village government, the establishment of the militia, the elimination of counter-revolutionaries, and the guarantee of completing the task of increasing production by half.

　　北京郊区的普及抗美援朝宣传
    金凤
    四月五日到十日，北京市组织了二十八个大中学校的师生员工一万一千七百多人，利用春假时间，配合了郊区数千个区、村干部和积极分子，在十五万户居民中，普遍进行了抗美援朝的宣传教育。全郊区二百五十五个行政村中，有二百五十二个村庄的约六十万农民，受到了抗美援朝教育。有一百零六个村庄的农民订立了爱国公约，提出检举特务、参加民兵、组织起来克服生产困难等具体任务。约有一半农民在世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言上签名，并举行了反对美国武装日本的投票。
    这次宣传证明：在抗美援朝宣传教育进行得比较差的农村，有必要组织学校、工厂的有组织群众，配合当地干部集中进行一次大规模的宣传教育。这一方面解决了农村宣传力量不足的困难；一方面可使农民群众对于抗美援朝运动得到初步了解，并可在运动中培养一批当地的宣传骨干，为农村今后经常进行抗美援朝宣传，创造有利条件。
    这次北京郊区宣传的经验之一，是以反对美国武装日本为宣传中心，从日寇暴行、镇压反革命谈起，由仇日引向仇美，形成群众性的反美爱国运动。郊区农民曾饱受日帝国主义、特务、恶霸的蹂躏。四千居民的清河镇，被日寇杀害了四百多人。其中被特务李永明、李铁保用铁锹劈死、活埋一百多人。因此，清河镇群众一看到墙上贴的日寇暴行的宣传画，就知道决不能让日本重新武装起来。宣传队一提起最近在清河枪毙的日寇特务李永明、李铁保，清河居民不分男女老少，个个眉飞色舞，谈得有声有色。
    如何使农民由仇日转向仇美，是这次宣传中一大关键问题。有些宣传队从郊区农民所熟悉的日寇的“三光政策”，谈到美帝国主义在朝鲜的“新三光政策”，使农民认识到“天下帝国主义都吃人”。有些宣传队通过演剧表演了美帝国主义者把枪交给日寇，农民一看就嚷起来了：“美国鬼子把刀把子交给日本鬼子想叫它再来糟蹋咱，可不能让它再来！”他们说：“原来日本的后台老板是美国，美国强盗比日本强盗还恶。”因此，在举行日本问题投票时，门头沟农民举起了双手，十五区妇女高举着孩子来表示他们反对美国武装日本的坚决意志。
    这次宣传的另一经验是：区村干部和学生、工人一起组成宣传队，实行宣传负责制，这种方法已被证明是有效的。这样组成的宣传队的好处在于：下乡的学生、工人比较了解时事，能掌握一般的宣传内容与多种多样的宣传方式；区、村干部了解当地情况，善于接近和组织群众。他们互相配合，互相提高。
    在这次宣传中，北京郊区绝大部分的领导干部都动员起来了。各区都分别召开干部会议专门布置，并划分了普及的责任地区。各区的中共区委与各校宣传队总负责人组成总的指挥部，共同拟订一区的宣传计划并督促检查它的实施。区干部又分别到各村协同村干部配合各学校宣传队进行宣传。分布到每村、每闾的宣传队和宣传小组实行“宣传负责制”，保证所属地区的居民普遍受到抗美援朝教育，这就充分发挥了每一个宣传者和当地干部的积极性和创造性。清华大学学生五个人负责二百多户的草桥村的宣传。他们三天内共访问了一百多户，又组织了一次宣传游行。他们拉着手风琴、背着漫画牌走在前面，后面走着小学生的队伍，这样又宣传了二百多个居民。
    这次宣传的第三个经验，证明小型宣传队、小型演出和小型座谈会——诉苦会，是适应农村分散的特点，使抗美援朝宣传普及的良好组织形式和宣传方式。一般农民都喜欢形象化的宣传。过去下乡的学生宣传队，也常常配备了文工队，演出具有政治内容的节目，很受群众欢迎。缺点在于文工队太少，难以普及。此次下乡的各校组成了许多小型宣传队，分布在各村。宣传队每人能掌握一种宣传本领，分散进行家庭访问、召集座谈会；集中起来就作小型演出——包括话剧、活报、快板、相声、拉洋片、秧歌剧、幻灯等。如清华大学在丰台、长辛店的两个宣传队一百二十人，三天中共宣传了二万七千人，平均一个人宣传了二百二十五人。宣传队搜集当地材料，演唱真人真事，更受群众欢迎。大井村宣传队演出该村一居民被日本鬼子挖心活埋的情况，台上台下哭成一片。
    这些小型演出一般解决了宣传的普及问题。小型座谈会往往发展为小型控诉会，可以进一步提高群众的政治觉悟。仅北京大学等十一个大学的宣传队在各村镇即召开了各种不同对象的小型座谈会一千七百六十三次，参加人数在十万以上。在这些会议上宣传队以回忆对比的方法启发群众进行控诉，以苦引苦，使群众由仇日而仇美。
    最后，这次宣传还提供了建立本地宣传队伍，保证抗美援朝宣传经常化的一些经验。
    北京郊区这次大规模的抗美援朝爱国宣传，教育了群众，更教育了区、村干部。十一区九宫村通过此次宣传运动，组织了包括村长，闾长、居民卫生组长、党团员、小学教员、民校教员、学生的宣传队伍。在学校宣传队离村后，他们继续在村里结合选举村政府，建立民兵、肃清反革命、保证完成增产半成等任务进行抗美援朝宣传。
