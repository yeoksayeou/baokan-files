　　Why are you working so hard?
    ——A conversation with Wang Fa, a worker at the Beijing People's Printing Factory
    Liu Xin
    You ask me, why is production in our factory so vigorous? In my opinion, the most important thing is that workers have a place to speak their minds, and what they say matters. Everyone realizes from their own experience that the factory is their own, and they are happy to work hard.

    The fact that we workers are the masters of our house is primarily reflected in the fact that workers have the right to manage the factory. In March of last year, our factory established a Factory Management Committee, with twelve workers elected as members to manage the factory together with the factory director, deputy factory director, chief engineer, and chairman of the trade union. Major factory matters must be discussed and decided by the Management Committee.

    Since its establishment, the Management Committee has held more than twenty regular meetings and more than ten temporary meetings. The factory director has never exercised his final decision-making power, always carefully considering the opinions of the workers and patiently explaining and persuading dissenting opinions. Before each meeting, the leadership would notify the members of the Management Committee of the issues to be discussed at the meeting, and the members would then solicit the opinions of the workers extensively, truly ensuring that the upper and lower levels communicated with each other. Everyone cares about and supports the Management Committee, and the workers happily implement the resolutions passed by the Management Committee.

    Because the factory leaders rely on the workers to run the factory well in every way, not only has production greatly improved, but many difficult problems related to workers' welfare have been gradually resolved. In the past, our factory was located in a low-lying area. On rainy days, workers had to wade through half a foot of water as soon as they left the factory gate. Last year, after the workers raised their concerns, the factory administration immediately found ways to repair the ditches and dredge the sewers, eradicating the flood. Another example is the moat around the factory, which had not been cleaned for more than forty years since the factory was built. The water in the ditch was dirty and smelly, with thick insects and many mosquitoes, seriously threatening the health of the workers. Now the moat has been cleaned, replaced with clean water, and sprinkled with lime and kerosene. Everyone said, "The workers have turned over, and the stinky ditch has also turned over." The raw materials used in the mold-making department are mostly chemical drugs, which can easily damage the health of the workers. The workers in the mold-making department have been issued masks and gloves, and the working hours have been appropriately shortened to six hours. In the past, the gravure printing machine equipment was not good, and workers' hands were constantly being crushed. After the workers raised their concerns, the administration installed safety bars. Last year, our factory also built a beautiful bathhouse, which also has a drying room for disinfecting clothes. These things are the most satisfying to all the workers in the factory.

    Factory Director He Xiaochu humbly learns from the workers and often holds forums with veteran workers and technical workers. Some veteran workers said: "I have lived for such a long time and have never seen anything like this! The factory director reports all the factory's affairs to us. Before liberation, not only did we have nowhere to speak, but we also had to send gifts to our superiors every year to keep our jobs!" Veteran worker Liu Yuechuan said: "In the past, if my eyes were blurry, I had to wear glasses secretly and take them off immediately when the boss came. If he saw it, he would say that you are too old to work. Now, it doesn't matter if you grow a beard. The older the technical worker, the more respected he is."

    With workers being so respected, how can everyone not work hard? In the past, seven people watched one gravure printing machine. After worker Gao Tongqing suggested improving the labor organization, it was changed to five people watching one machine, saving more than one hundred labor units every day. Zhang Chengpu, a boiler worker, felt very sorry when he saw that the factory consumed 32 tons of coal every day in winter. After careful consideration, he rationally changed the wiring of the electric wires to reduce power consumption, saving more than three tons of coal every day. There are many similar improvements like this. Many veteran technical workers have now broken with the conservative view of "keeping a trick up their sleeve." Liu Guanrun, a sixty-year-old plate-making technician, recently fell ill, and the factory introduced him to the Beijing Hospital for treatment. The factory director, the chairman of the trade union, and the secretary of the CCP branch all personally went to the hospital to see him and arranged for him to be comfortable. Old Liu said with emotion: "In the past, my old mind was not changed, and I did not teach apprentices seriously. I was afraid that if I taught the technology to others, I would have nothing to eat. In the future, when I get better, I must take out all my skills."

### 为什么干活这么起劲？——记北京人民印刷厂工人王发的谈话

　　为什么干活这么起劲？      
    ——记北京人民印刷厂工人王发的谈话
    柳新
    你问我，为啥我们工厂生产搞的这么起劲？依我看，头一条就是工人有话有地方说，说了也顶事，大伙从切身经验中体会到厂子是自己的，有活就乐意干。
    我们工人当了家，首先表现在工人有权管理工厂。我们厂里去年三月成立工厂管理委员会，有十二名工人当选为委员，和正副厂长、总工程师、工会主席等一起来管理工厂。工厂的大事情，都要通过管理委员会来讨论决定。
    管理委员会自成立到现在，共开了二十多次定期会议和十几次临时会议，厂长一直没有运用过他的最后决定权，总是那样细心地考虑工人的意见，耐心地解释说服分歧的意见。每一次开会时，领导上事前都把会上要讨论的问题通知管委会委员，委员们再广泛征求职工的意见，确实做到上下互相通气。大伙都很关心和拥护管委会，管委会通过的决议，工人都愉快地执行。
    由于工厂领导干部处处依靠工人来搞好工厂，不但生产大大提高，许多很难解决的有关工人福利的问题，都逐步解决了。过去，我们工厂地势低洼，大雨天，工人一出厂门就要趟半尺深的水。去年，经过工人提意见，工厂行政马上设法修沟，疏通下水道，根绝了水患。再如工厂四周的护墙沟，建厂四十余年来一直就没有清理过，沟水脏臭，虫子稠，蚊子多，严重地威胁着工人的健康。现在护墙沟已经清理，换上了清水，撒上了石灰煤油。大伙都说：“工人翻了身，臭沟也翻身了。”制模科所用的原料多是化学药品，容易损害工人健康，制模科的工人都发了口罩、手套，适当地把工作时间缩短为六小时。过去凹印机设备不良，不断压伤工人的手，经过工人提意见，行政上就给按了保险杆子。去年，我们厂还修建了一个漂亮的澡堂，还设有进行衣服消毒的干燥室。这些事都是办的最叫全厂工人痛快的。
    贺晓初厂长虚心向工人学习，经常召开老工人和技术工人座谈会。有些老工人说：“活这样大的岁数，没见过呀！全厂的事，厂长要向咱报告。在解放以前，不但有话无处说，每年还要向上级送点礼物，才能保住饭碗呀！”老工人刘月川说：“在过去，眼睛花了戴眼镜还要偷偷摸摸地戴，头来了马上拿下来。要让他看见，就会说你年老不能再干活了。现在么，你留起胡子也没关系，越是老技术工人，越受尊重。”
    工人这样受尊重，大家怎能不努力工作？过去七个人看一部凹印机，经工人高同庆建议改进劳动组织，改为五个人看一部，每天就节省了一百多个劳动力。烧锅炉的工人张承浦，因见厂里冬季每天用电要消耗三十二吨煤，他心里十分痛惜，经过苦心捉摸，合理改变电线的线路，减少电力消耗，每天就能少烧三吨多煤。类似这样的改进很多。很多老技术工人，现在也打破了“留一手”的保守观点。六十多岁的制版技术工人刘观润，最近病了，厂里把他介绍到北京医院医治。厂长、工会主席和中共党支部书记都亲自到医院里去看他，把他安排得舒舒服服的。老刘感动地说：“过去我的老脑筋未改变，教徒弟不认真，我怕把技术教给别人，自己没饭吃。往后病好了，我一定得把全部手艺都拿出来。”
