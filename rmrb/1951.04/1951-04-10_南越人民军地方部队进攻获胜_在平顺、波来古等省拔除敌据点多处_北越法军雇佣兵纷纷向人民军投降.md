Xinhua News Agency, April 9th dispatch: According to Vietnam News Agency, Central Vietnam, April 8th: The People's Army local forces in Central and South Vietnam, in order to cooperate with the great battles on the North Vietnamese front during February and March, actively fought in various war zones and continuously achieved victories. On February 13th, People's Army troops eliminated two enemy strongholds north of Khanh Hoa Province, seizing eight machine guns and a large number of rifles and carbines. In Binh Thuan Province, People's Army troops actively attacked, eliminating a total of fifteen enemy strongholds by the end of February. In the provinces inhabited by ethnic minorities in the highlands, the People's Army local forces and militia also won many important victories. They eliminated an enemy stronghold with strong fortifications in Pleiku Province, and all the mercenaries stationed there immediately surrendered to the People's Army after the first shot was fired. After the People's Army troops eliminated several enemy strongholds in Na Phu on March 3rd, they eliminated several enemy strongholds in Tra on March 13th, liberating 6,000 residents under enemy rule and driving away the enemy from two other strongholds in Gia Lai and Kon Tum provinces. On March 13th, in Da Nang, a city occupied by the French army in Central Vietnam, the underground military and political committee launched a competition movement to smash the enemy's plan to defend strongholds and accelerate the establishment of a military people's regime in Da Nang. During the first week of the competition movement, hand grenades and landmines exploded in many places in Da Nang, causing great panic among the enemy and lowering morale. After the People's Army won a great victory north of Thua Thien Province, many enemy troops stationed in various strongholds east of Da Nang surrendered to the People's Army with their weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, April 9th dispatch: According to Vietnam News Agency: In the victorious offensive launched by the Vietnamese People's Army at the end of March against the French army strongholds of Mao Khe, Chang Bai, and Ong Mi north of Haiphong, many European and African mercenaries of the French army surrendered to the People's Army.

On March 28th, six German soldiers stationed in Han Dan (transliteration) surrendered with their weapons. On March 30th, all the mercenaries stationed at the Thuan Mai stronghold on the Dong Trieu-Hong Gai highway surrendered to the People's Army. When they passed near the Kim Bridge stronghold, they called on the local French army mercenaries to follow their example. As a result, thirty-five mercenaries in these two strongholds immediately surrendered with their weapons.

In Fa Lai, North African mercenaries in the French army recently held demonstrations demanding to be sent home. The French military authorities initially attempted to disperse them by force, but because the demonstrators were very determined, they were eventually forced to allow the repatriation of 300 Moroccan and Senegalese soldiers.

    【新华社九日讯】据越南通讯社讯：在越南人民军三月底向海防以北毛溪、长白与翁密等法军据点的胜利进攻中，法军的许多欧洲及非洲的雇佣兵纷纷向人民军投诚。
