　　Criticizing Cadres for Harboring Landlord Families
    Has Greatly Educated Me
    Letter from Comrade Chen Bu Xiang
To the Editor:
    After reading the news in the People's Daily on March 19th about Ge Feng being sentenced to two years imprisonment for harboring landlords, I was deeply moved! This further proves that the Party and the government handle matters with great prudence and fairness. Regardless of whether you are a veteran Party member, a high-ranking cadre, an ordinary worker, or a common person, good deeds will be praised, and bad deeds will be punished.
    When I saw the People's Daily publish the story of Ge Feng on February 9th, I immediately thought of the event in the Worker's Daily on February 10th, where Comrade Wu Jihua firmly opposed his father (a landlord). Comparing the two at that time, I truly felt, "Both are cadres, yet how far apart they are!" Later (on March 16th), after seeing the People's Daily publish the situation of Xu Dong of the Nanjing Branch of the East China People's Revolutionary University being punished for harboring a landlord family, I thought of Ge Feng's case again, because all three matters involved the relationship between cadres and landlord family members. However, Comrade Wu Jihua stood on the side of the people and is already a son of the people; Xu Dong and Ge Feng stood on the side of the landlords and are still the sons and nephews of landlords. Now, Ge Feng and Xu Dong have received appropriate punishment from the Party and the government. The Zhejiang Daily, the Nanjing Xinhua Daily, and the People's Daily all published strong editorials and short commentaries when reporting the cases of Ge Feng and Xu Dong, which greatly enhanced the prestige of the Party and the government among the masses. Such practices could not be seen or heard of before the era of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Let us warmly support the Party and the government!
                                                        Chen Bu Xiang
            Letter from Comrade Hui Min
To the Editor:
    The article "Regarding Xu Dong, Head of the Organization Department of the Nanjing Branch of the East China People's Revolutionary University, Publicly Undermining Land Reform and Harboring Landlord Families," published in the "Party Life" column of the People's Daily on March 16th, has greatly educated me.
    I believe that all organs and schools (schools of a cadre training class nature), regardless of new or old cadres and students, who come from landlord families and are currently in land reform areas, should accept Xu Dong's lesson, stand firm, and wage struggle. They should see their own landlord families in connection with the entire landlord class. They should not think that their own family is somehow progressive, does not exploit much, and has not committed any sins against the masses in the past; nor should they think that it is okay to struggle against other landlords, but not against their own families. Such thinking is even more wrong. Even if they consider their own family to be "not bad," it is still a landlord family; therefore, it should be treated as a social class. As a revolutionary, one should bravely pass this test in order to better temper oneself. In order for each of our comrades to not make or make fewer mistakes, I suggest that comrades in this situation should currently communicate with their families less. Even if family letters arrive, do not reply without authorization, so as not to deviate from policy in the letters and mix in personal elements, thus suppressing the land reform movement of the peasants; even more so, do not ask the organization to write letters of proof to defend the landlord class. Especially in the current fierce struggle, it is best not to go home, so as not to affect or suppress the peasants' fighting spirit. At the same time, I hope that all competent authorities can skillfully grasp this situation, and I hope that all organs and schools (cadre training schools) will treat the short commentary in the "Party Life" column of the People's Daily on March 16th as a special topic, organize learning, and conduct a discussion.

### 批评干部包庇地主家庭  使我受到很大教育

　　批评干部包庇地主家庭      
    使我受到很大教育
    陈步湘同志来信编辑同志：
    读了三月十九日人民日报所登葛风包庇地主，被判徒刑二年的消息，心里非常感动！由此更可证明党和政府处理一件事情，是很审慎也很公正的。不管你是老资格的党员、高级干部、普通职工或一般人民，好的就会受到表扬，坏的就要受到处分。
    当我看到二月九日人民日报发表葛风的事后，就联想到二月十日工人日报所登吴季华同志坚定立场反对父亲（地主）的事件，当时两相比较，真有“同是干部，相差何远”之感！后来（三月十六日）看到人民日报登着华东人民革命大学南京分校徐栋包庇地主家庭受到处分的情形，又想起了葛风的事，因为这三件事情，都是干部对地主家属的关系所发生，不过吴季华同志是站在人民一边，已是人民的儿子；徐栋、葛风是站在地主一边，仍是地主的子侄。现在葛风、徐栋，已受到党和政府适当处分，浙江日报、南京新华日报、人民日报在发表葛风、徐栋案件时，都发表了有力的社论和短评，这就使党和政府的威信，在群众中大大地提高了。这种做法，不是在共产党和毛主席的时代，是看不到听不到的。让我们热烈地拥护党和政府吧！

            惠民同志来信编辑同志：
    三月十六日人民日报《党的生活》栏所登的《关于华东人民革命大学南京分校组织处长徐栋公开破坏土地改革，包庇地主家庭》一文，给了我很大的教育。
    我觉得所有机关、学校（干部训练班性质学校）无论新老干部、学员，凡是地主家庭出身，而目前又在土地改革区，都应该接受徐栋的教训，坚定立场，进行斗争。把自己的地主家庭和整个地主阶级联系起来看，不应认为自己家庭如何进步，剥削不大，对群众过去没有什么罪恶；更不应认为斗争别的地主可以，斗争自己的家庭则不应该，这种思想更是错误的，即使自认为自己的家庭“不坏”，但总是地主家庭；所以应把它当做一个社会阶级来看待。作为一个革命者，应当勇敢地度过这一关，以便更好地锻炼自己。为了我们每一同志不犯或少犯错误，我建议有这种情况的同志，目前都应少和家里通信，即便家庭来信，也不要擅自答复，以免在信中离开政策，掺杂个人成份，而抑制农民的土地改革运动；更不要要求机关写证明信，为地主阶级辩护，尤其是在目前激烈斗争中，最好不要回家，以免影响或抑制农民的斗争情绪。同时也希望各主管机关，能善于掌握这一情况，并希望各机关、学校（训练干部学校），把三月十六日人民日报《党的生活》栏的短评当作一个专题，组织学习和进行一次讨论。
