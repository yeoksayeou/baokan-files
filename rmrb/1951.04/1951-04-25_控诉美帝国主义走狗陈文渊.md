Accusation Against Chen Wen-yuan, a Running Dog of American Imperialism
Li Muqun, Pastor of the Chinese Lutheran Church in Chongqing

I accuse Chen Wen-yuan, a degenerate in our Christian community and a running dog and special agent of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

Before liberation, Chen Wen-yuan was a representative of the pseudo-National Assembly, the director of education of the reactionary Three People's Principles Youth League, and an advisor to Chiang Kai-shek. At the time, he told church members, "I don't take a salary, and I don't wear a uniform," trying to deceive them in order to hide within the church and carry out his espionage activities.

When students across the country were angrily protesting the atrocities of the American military in China, Chen Wen-yuan said at a sermon at the West China University office in Chengdu: "Some people have 'misunderstandings' about 'American friends'. I haven't received any intelligence about these situations. As far as I know, the American military came to China to 'help China resist Japan'. This spirit of sacrifice is just like Jesus's sacrifice on the cross." He defended the bandits and used sermons to spread his fallacies.

Because Chen Wen-yuan was a loyal henchman of Chiang Kai-shek, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chiang Kai-shek gave him the Huangshan "official residence" built with the people's hard-earned money. Chen Wen-yuan renamed Huangshan "Jiangshan", played the religious card, and used war criminal Soong Mei-ling's and American imperialism's "donations" to found the "Chung Cheng Children's Welfare Village." An American was in charge, and Chinese children were subjected to enslavement education. At a recent accusation meeting, a twelve-year-old child from the "Welfare Village" accused: "They often promoted how rich and good America is, and how poor and bad China is. They often showed us American movies, showing American children eating cream bread and drinking sugar milk, and at the same time, they showed movies taken in Chinese villages or disaster areas, showing how Chinese children suffer. This made many of us admire America and love America, but not love our own motherland."

On the eve of liberation, a co-worker from the Methodist Church asked Chen Wen-yuan for a raise because his salary was not enough to maintain his livelihood. Chen said: "I also have difficulties, I have no money." Did he really have no money? At that time, he kept ten large foreign dogs for war criminal Soong Mei-ling at home. What these ten dogs ate could support four middle-class families. Once, someone hit his foreign dog, and Chen's wife said fiercely: "You can't hit Madame Chiang's dog! Madame Chiang will be back!" Even on the eve of the reactionary regime's collapse, he was still relying on the power of the dog! His family was still saying that the reactionaries would return!

After the liberation of Chongqing, Chen Wen-yuan continued to engage in anti-people activities.

He refused to sign the reform declaration. Wei Shusheng, a co-worker from the Methodist Church, personally delivered the declaration to his home. After reading it, he stubbornly said: "I don't admit that Christianity has anything to do with imperialism." "Christianity is above politics." Representatives, he was a representative of the pseudo-National Assembly, the director of education of the Three People's Principles Youth League, and an advisor to the number one war criminal Chiang Kai-shek. Is this his being above politics? It's simply nonsense! (Applause)

He used his position as the bishop of the West China Methodist Church to transfer a man named Zhuo Wei from Chengdu to Chongqing to serve as the chief accountant of the Chongqing diocese. What kind of person is Zhuo Wei? He is an American super-spy who is destroying the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people under the guise of religion. According to known facts, Zhuo Wei has engaged in the following reactionary activities: First, on the eve of the liberation of Chongqing, American agent Nolan flew to Chongqing and had secret talks with Zhuo Wei at the United States Information Service, with strict security and no one allowed to enter; Second, after liberation, he sent secret telegrams to the United States Information Service in Hong Kong, reporting on the situation in Chongqing. Third, he hid a large number of supplies from the "Rural Reconstruction Committee." Fourth, he listened to "Voice of America", typed it out, and distributed it to American imperialist elements in churches in various places through the church. Chen Wen-yuan intentionally placed such an American super-spy in the church, which proves that he was implementing the plans of the American and Chiang bandit gangs.

The American military radio station he hid was not discovered until February of this year, when the government received a report from patriotic church members of the Methodist Church. The radio station, including both the transmitter and receiver, was fully installed. What else could this be other than espionage activities in contact with American imperialism? In addition, many military supplies were found in his home.

Thanks to the wise government, it has cleared out thirteen special agents in our church; these special agents were all arranged by Chen Wen-yuan before and after liberation. Zhou Yunwen, the male student guidance director of West China University, was a Central Statistics Bureau special agent. After liberation, Chen Wen-yuan arranged for him to become the chief accountant of the West China Methodist Church. Chen Mingdao, a training instructor at West China University, was one of the murderers in the infamous Twelve Bridge blood case in Chengdu on the eve of liberation, and a Central Statistics Bureau special agent. After liberation, Chen Wen-yuan arranged for him to become the accountant of the Chongqing diocese of the Methodist Church. In addition, the heads of the Jianyang and Suining dioceses, and the former and current principals of Qiujing Middle School, are all pawns arranged by Chen Wen-yuan. This is ironclad evidence that American imperialism and its running dogs use the church to carry out espionage activities, and it fully proves that Chen Wen-yuan is an international spy directed by American imperialism and a die-hard American-Chiang running dog who is an enemy of the people.

Before we left Chongqing, we held a preliminary accusation meeting for Catholic and Christian church members. All the church members were extremely angry at the anti-people crimes of the church traitor Chen Wen-yuan, and unanimously demanded that Chen Wen-yuan be escorted to Chongqing for public trial by the people, and demanded that the government severely punish him!

Comrades, in today's nationwide in-depth movement to resist America and aid Korea, and in today's nationwide demand for the resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Chen Wen-yuan's kind of scum is intolerable to the vast Chinese people, and it is also intolerable to our patriotic Christians! (Applause) In order to consolidate the fruits of the revolutionary victory, we resolutely support the government's wise measures to arrest Chen Wen-yuan. We demand that the government give Chen Wen-yuan the punishment he deserves! (Applause) In order to carry out the Three-Self Patriotic Movement well, thoroughly sever all ties with imperialism, and eliminate the influence of imperialism, especially American imperialism, in our church, we demand that our comrades in the Methodist Church make a solemn statement! (Applause) Remove Chen Wen-yuan from all positions in the church and remove scum like Chen Wen-yuan from our church! (Applause)

Chen Wen-yuan's crimes have taught us a great lesson. We must take it as a warning, raise our political awareness, expose the bad elements lurking in the church, and eliminate all imperialist influences in the church, so that the church can truly become the church of the Chinese people.

　　控诉美帝国主义走狗陈文渊
    重庆中华路德会牧师　李牧群
    我控诉我们基督教的败类、美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的走狗特务——陈文渊。
    解放前，陈文渊是伪国大代表，又是反动的三青团的教育长，又是蒋匪介石的顾问。他当时对教友说：“我并没有拿薪水，也没有穿制服”，想欺骗教友，好隐藏在教会里面，进行他的特务活动。
    当全国学生愤怒抗议美军在中国的暴行时，陈文渊在成都华西大学事务所的讲道会上说：“有些人对‘美国朋友’有‘误解’，这些情形我还没有收到情报，据我所知道的，美军到中国来，是为了‘帮助中国抗战’，这种牺牲精神，简直和耶稣上十字架的牺牲精神一样。”替强盗们作辩护，而且利用讲道会来散布他的谬论。
    因为陈文渊是蒋介石的忠实爪牙，抗日战争胜利后，蒋介石把他搜刮民脂民膏所建筑的黄山“官邸”，送给了陈文渊。陈文渊把黄山改名“蒋山”，打起宗教的牌子，用战犯宋美龄和美帝国主义的“捐款”，创办“中正福幼村”，由一个美国人负责，对中国儿童，施行奴化教育，前些时的控诉会上，一个十二岁的“福幼村”的孩子控诉说：“他们经常宣传美国怎样富足，怎样好，说中国怎样穷，怎样不好。常常放美国电影给我们看，看电影上美国孩子吃奶油面包，喂白糖牛奶，同时又放映在中国乡下或者灾区拍的电影给我们看，看中国的孩子怎样受苦。使我们很多孩子羡慕美国、爱美国，而不爱我们自己的祖国。”
    解放前夕，卫理公会一位同工，因为薪水不够维持生活，向陈文渊要求加点薪，陈说：“我也困难，没有钱。”他是不是没有钱呢？当时他家里替战犯宋美龄养着十条大洋狗，这十条狗吃的东西，就可以养活中等家庭四家人。有一次有人打了他的洋狗，陈的太太恶狠狠地说：“不能打蒋夫人的狗呀！蒋夫人还要回来的哪！”在反动政权要垮台的前夕，他还人仗狗势！他的家里还在说反动派还要回来！
    重庆解放后，陈文渊继续进行反人民的活动。
    他拒绝在革新宣言上签名。卫理公会的同工韦恕生道友亲自把宣言送到他家里去，他看了以后，顽固地说：“我不承认基督教与帝国主义有什么关系。”“基督教是超政治的。”诸位代表，他是伪国大代表，又是三青团的教育长，又是头号战犯蒋介石的顾问，这是他的超政治吗？简直是鬼话！（鼓掌）
    他利用华西卫理公会会督的职权，把一个名叫卓伟的从成都调到重庆，担任重庆教区的总会计。卓伟是什么样的人呢？他是披着宗教外衣、破坏中国人民革命事业的美国大特务。——根据已知道的事实，卓伟就有下列这些反动活动：第一，重庆解放前夕，美国特务诺兰飞到重庆，在美国新闻处与卓伟密谈，门禁森严，任何人不准入内；第二，解放后，密电香港美国新闻处，报告重庆的情况。第三，隐藏“农村复兴委员会”的大批物资。第四，收听“美国之音”，用打字机打出来，通过教会发给各地教会中的美帝国主义分子。——这样一个美国大特务，陈文渊有意把他安置在教会里，这就证明他是执行美、蒋匪帮的计划来做的。
    他隐藏的美国军用电台，一直到今年二月，政府接到卫理公会爱国教友的检举，才搜查出来。这部电台，收发报机都装置得好好的，这不是进行与美帝国主义联系的特务活动是什么？另外，在他家里还搜出很多军用品。
    感谢贤明的政府，替我们在教会里清除了十三个特务；这些特务，都是陈文渊在解放前后一手布置的。华西大学男生指导长周允文，是个中统特务，解放后，陈文渊把他安置到华西卫理公会当总会计。华西大学训导员陈明道，是解放前夕成都著名的十二桥血案凶手之一，中统特务，解放后，陈文渊把他安置到卫理公会重庆教区当会计。此外，还有简阳、遂宁两个教区长，求精中学前任和现任校长等，都是陈文渊布置的爪牙。这是美帝国主义和它的走狗利用教会进行特务活动的铁证，也充分证明陈文渊是美帝国主义指使的国际间谍，死心塌地与人民为敌的美、蒋走狗。
    我们离开重庆前，开了天主教、基督教教友们的控诉预备会。所有的教友对教会叛徒陈文渊的反人民罪行，都愤怒万分，一致要求把陈文渊押到重庆交给人民公审，要求政府严厉惩办！
    各位同道，在全国深入抗美援朝运动的今天，在全国人民要求坚决镇压反革命的今天，陈文渊这种败类是广大的中国人民所不能容忍的，也是我们爱国教徒所不能容忍的！（鼓掌）为了巩固革命胜利的成果，我们坚决拥护政府逮捕陈文渊的英明措施。我们要求政府对陈文渊予以应得的处分！（鼓掌）为了搞好三自革新运动，彻底斩断与帝国主义的一切关系，肃清帝国主义特别是美帝国主义在我们教内的影响，我们要求卫理公会的同道们，严正地表明态度！（鼓掌）革除陈文渊在教会里一切职务，把陈文渊这一类的败类从我们教会中清除出去！（鼓掌）
    陈文渊的罪行，给我们很大的教训，我们要引为警惕，提高政治认识，揭发潜伏在教会里面的坏分子，肃清教会里帝国主义的一切影响，使教会真正成为中国人民自己的教会。
