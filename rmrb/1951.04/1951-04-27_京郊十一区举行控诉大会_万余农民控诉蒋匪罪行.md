　　Ten Districts in the Beijing Suburbs Hold Accusation Meetings
    Over Ten Thousand Farmers Accuse Chiang Kai-shek Bandits of Crimes
    The People's Government of the Eleventh District of Beijing Suburbs held an accusation meeting against counter-revolutionary elements at the Nan Yuan Town Square on the 25th, attended by over ten thousand farmers. Farmers from forty to fifty *li* away also rushed to participate. The bandits and special agents accused numbered twenty-four, all criminals who owed countless blood debts to the people. When they were escorted before the people, the masses shouted in unison, "Shoot them, avenge the people!" In a corner of the venue were displayed the bones of those murdered by the special agent Li Kuoting, which further increased the masses' anger and hatred.
    As the accusations began, the accusers rushed to speak. Poor peasant Zhang Xu-shi accused Li Ronghua and Chang Defang, the main culprits in the Xu Jia Chang murder case. On the evening of the fourteenth day of the second lunar month last year, Li Ronghua, Chang Defang, and two others broke into her home, demanding guns. They tied up and beat her brother to death, also beating her younger brother and father to death. Even her eighty-year-old father-in-law was crippled by them. Her husband hid outside and has not returned to this day. Zhang Wang-shi from Li Yuan Village tearfully accused Chiang Kai-shek's special agents Li Jinming and Li Jinyuan. After the Japanese surrender, one night, Li Jinyuan broke into her house and acted improperly, so she drove him out. In the third month of the following year, Li Jinyuan dragged her daughter into a dilapidated temple and raped her. Her daughter was only fourteen years old and died not long after returning home. Before her death, her daughter said to her, "When my younger brother grows up, tell him to avenge me." The white-haired old woman Zhang Wang-shi fainted on the spot while accusing them, overcome with grief. Farmer Yuan Lianshan accused Li Jinming and Li Jinyuan of being Japanese special agents during the period of the Japanese puppet regime, forcing people everywhere to buy guns. After the victory of the War of Resistance, they became the henchmen of Zhang Yinwu, the Kuomintang special agent leader, massacring communists, suppressing the student movement, and raping women everywhere. Li Jinyuan alone raped sixteen women. After liberation, they engaged in counter-revolutionary activities everywhere, saying, "The Kuomintang is coming back, just you wait."
    A total of forty-six people took the stage to make accusations. The masses unanimously demanded that the government severely punish these bandits and not allow them to harm the people again.

　　京郊十一区举行控诉大会
    万余农民控诉蒋匪罪行
    北京市郊区第十一区人民政府于二十五日在南苑镇广场举行控诉反革命分子大会，到农民群众一万余人。四、五十里以外的农民也都赶来参加。被控诉的土匪、特务有二十四人，都是积欠了人民无数血债的罪犯。当他们被押到人民面前时，群众一齐高呼：“要枪毙他们，为人民复仇！”会场的一角陈列着被特务李阔亭杀害的尸骨，这更增加了群众的愤怒与仇恨。
    控诉开始，控诉人争先发言。贫农张徐氏控诉徐家场凶杀案主犯李荣华和常德芳。去年阴历二月十四日的晚上，李荣华、常德芳等四个人闯入她家，向她家要枪，把她哥哥捆起来打死了，又打死了她的弟弟和父亲，连她八十岁的翁翁也被他们打成了残废。她的丈夫躲在外面，至今还没有回来。李园村的张王氏，哭诉蒋匪特务李金铭和李金元。日本投降后，有一天晚上，李金元闯进她家来胡闹，被她赶了出去。第二年三月间，李金元就把她的闺女拖在破庙里强奸了，她闺女才十四岁，回来不久就死了。临死前她闺女对她说：“将来弟弟大了叫他给我报仇。”白发的老太太张王氏在控诉时因悲痛过分，当场昏了过去。农民元连善控诉李金铭和李金元二人在日伪时代当日本人的特务，到处强迫百姓买枪。抗战胜利了，又当国民党特务头子张荫梧的狗腿，残杀共产党员，压迫学生运动，到处强奸妇女。仅李金元一个人就强奸妇女十六人。解放后他们又到处进行反革命活动，说：“国民党就要回来了，你们等着吧。”
    前后上台控诉的有四十六人，群众一致要求政府严办这些匪徒，不让他们再来残害人民。
