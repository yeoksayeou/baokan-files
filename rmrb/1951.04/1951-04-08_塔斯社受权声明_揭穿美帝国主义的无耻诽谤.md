　　TASS Authorized Statement
　  Exposing the Shameless Slanders of US Imperialism
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th: TASS Moscow, 7th: The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Rayburn, made a speech in the House on April 4th, falsely claiming that "non-Chinese troops" were gathering in Northeast China. Subsequently, some American newspapers published news, generally saying that Rayburn was referring to Soviet troops gathering in Northeast China.

　　塔斯社受权声明
　  揭穿美帝国主义的无耻诽谤
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日电：美国众院议长雷朋曾于四月四日在众院发表谈话，硬说有“非中国的部队”正在中国东北集结。事后若干美国报纸发表消息，大意谓：雷朋是说苏联部队正在中国东北聚集。
    塔斯社兹受权声明：这些消息是不确的，是诽谤性的，因为在中国东北没有苏联部队。
