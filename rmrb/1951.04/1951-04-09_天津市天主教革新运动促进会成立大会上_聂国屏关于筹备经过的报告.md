Chairman, Respected Leaders, Guests, Respected Teachers and Fellow Catholics:

　　The new China after liberation is growing stronger day by day, and Catholicism in China must also stand up! The strength of the new China undoubtedly lies first in overcoming imperialist aggression. Similarly, if Catholicism in China does not resolutely sever its ties with imperialism and allows it to trample on it, it will not only harm the motherland, but also the future of the Church will be unimaginable. Therefore, in the nationwide upsurge of patriotism and anti-imperialism, kind-hearted Catholics in various places launched this Three-Self (self-governance, self-support, self-propagation, same below) reform movement of patriotism and love of the Church and anti-imperialism. On November 30th last year, Father Wang Liangzuo of Guangyuan, Sichuan, first published the Catholic Reform Declaration, which was immediately supported by Catholics across the country, who rose up in response. In such a fervent atmosphere, Tianjin City, thanks to the active efforts of Mr. Wu Kezhai and others, established the preparatory committee for the Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association on January 11th of this year. And on the 13th, it issued a reform declaration.

　　The reform movement, from its very beginning, caused panic among imperialist elements like Bu Xiangxian and Zheng Huamin, who saw their power threatened and could no longer ride roughshod over Chinese Catholics. Therefore, they resorted to all sorts of conspiracies and sabotage, falsely claiming that anyone who signed was "apostate," "committing a serious sin," and "separating from the Pope," using "suspension of divine services" to intimidate Catholics. They also issued self-deceiving lies such as, "There is no imperialism within Catholicism, nor has it ever been used by imperialism," attempting to cover up the ugly historical facts of imperialist aggression in order to deceive Catholics. Without citing distant historical examples, such as the "missionary privileges" recorded in unequal treaties and a series of disastrous cases that harmed the country and the people, it is already clear. Take the "Xikai Incident" in Tianjin as an example, where Bishop Du (a Frenchman) used foreign troops to forcibly occupy Lao Xikai, turning it into a "French concession." Father Ma of Wanghailou was stripped of his power for opposing the sale of church property by French priests. Wen Guibin (a Frenchman) of Xikai, fearing that church power would fall into the hands of Chinese priests, recruited a large number of Dutch priests to Tianjin to occupy parishes, seize power, and enjoy themselves to the fullest, while Chinese priests were under their control and lived in poverty. Imperialist elements stubbornly insisted that the Dutch priests' money was their own, but thanks to the testimony of Catholics, it was discovered that all the money, materials, and accounts of the entire Xikai Cathedral were controlled by the Dutch priests. It is rumored that the general accounts of Xikai have all been shipped to the Netherlands. They say, "There is no imperialism within Catholicism," truly uttering a blatant lie.

　　Imperialist elements also obstructed Chinese priests and Catholics from signing the reform declaration, saying, "Catholicism is supra-political, and priests are not allowed to participate in politics." But Yu Bin colluded with the US-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to subvert the motherland and antagonize the people, so why wasn't he stripped of his power? Furthermore, Lei Zhenyuan colluded with Kuomintang secret agents to organize the "Catholic Patriotic Corps," establishing reactionary organizations in five provinces and three cities in North China, carrying out "defection," "intelligence gathering," and "assassination" and other sabotage activities, clamoring for "anti-Soviet," "anti-Communist" to launch a war. And using the bandit "Peiping Kuomintang Secret Service Bureau" as a communication station, providing intelligence to the US-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and plotting to assassinate people's leaders near Pingshan County. The "Catholic Patriotic Corps" was divided into four brigades, with twenty-five priests taking on the task of guiding priests in each brigade, luring Catholics to issue passes with the "August 13th" unit number for espionage activities. There was also the recent case of espionage by Bu Xiangxian, Bao Yihua, Fang Ruhui and others of Tianjin University, who secretly hid radio stations to communicate with the enemy, and used religion as a pretext to call on Catholics to oppose the government and undermine the Resist US, Aid Korea movement. These crimes, which one was not carried out under the guise of Catholicism being "supra-political" to engage in reactionary political activities? Imperialists always lump Catholicism together with anti-people reactionary activities, teaching us to believe imperialist aggression as a matter of faith, and if we don't believe it, they say we will go to hell. They hoped that the US imperialists would drop atomic bombs, hoped for a third world war, hoped that we would never cooperate with the government until we died. Even in early 1949, when Catholics participated in the parade celebrating the liberation of Tianjin, Father Mei (a Dutchman) even called it a great sin of apostasy leading to hell. The vast majority of us Catholics are loyal and kind, and have been fooled and blinded by imperialism for a long time. In the past, we only knew that the words of priests were golden rules, and we could not recognize that imperialist elements used religious belief to carry out espionage activities. We not only did not dare to criticize the mistakes of the priests, but we did not even dare to think about it, always believing that even thinking about it was a serious sin of insulting the priests. For example, when the faculty and students of Tianjin University signed a petition to demand the dismissal of Bu Xiangxian, Bu Xiangxian said to the Catholic students: "Whoever signs to drive away the priest is committing a serious sin." We oppose Austin's slander, and we will be "apostate" and "go to hell." In other words, opposing Austin is opposing God. Is imperialism God, and is God imperialism?! Imperialist elements are very cunning and treacherous. They know that our blind worship of him is the best guarantee for covering up his espionage activities. Therefore, they always let Catholics believe his espionage activities as a matter of faith, and want to organize the espionage organization into an internal church organization, and want us to participate in this reactionary organization to carry out reactionary activities. In this way, they would not say that it is a crime and offends God, but on the contrary, they would say that it is zealous in respecting God and serving God. For example, the Lei Zhenyuan's special agent organization "Catholic Patriotic Corps" wanted to add the word "Catholic" to incorporate religious belief so that we could faithfully serve imperialism to the death. This is the consistent trick of imperialism and ironclad evidence of using religion to carry out aggressive conspiracies. However, many of our Catholics have been fooled by imperialism and are still acting as megaphones, saying, "Catholicism has never been used by imperialism at all, it has no relationship at all, and there is naturally no question of severing the relationship." Another example is Jin Yupei, the second captain of the "Catholic Patriotic Corps," who wanted to confess and register with the government after liberation, but his guiding priest, Father Liu Ximan, stopped him, saying, "If you register and confess, you will be destroying the Holy Church," frightening Jin Yupei with religious doctrines, and Jin continued to engage in espionage activities. From this sentence of Liu Ximan, it makes people feel that betraying the espionage activity is betraying the church, then Catholicism is a special agent organization, and the special agent organization is Catholicism! So that people in the society see Catholicism as special agents, can this Catholicism still exist? This is also very obvious, today Catholicism has fallen to this point, it is entirely caused by these imperialist elements. In other words, who harmed our church? There is no doubt that it is imperialist elements, not the people of the society, and even less the government that does not have freedom of belief. Therefore, it is very obvious that it is not a matter of faith, but the issue of the relationship between our church and imperialism. The objective manifestation is that the church and special agents are indistinguishable. This is what every patriotic person is pained by, and it is also what the Chinese people, who have stood up, do not allow. This is the actual situation of the social status of Catholicism in the new China. Therefore, a major task before us Catholics is whether we still want this Catholicism or not. If we still want this church, love this church, and still hope that this church will continue to exist in society, then we must cut off contact with imperialism in order to gain social understanding. Our Three-Self Reform Movement starts from this purpose and this foundation. Some people have also proposed: He is a priest, and he cannot be opposed. We need to know whether we love the church or love imperialism. We must "adore God above all things," not "adore imperialism above all things." If we ruin the church for the sake of a certain imperialist element's personal problem, that is an act of loving imperialism more than loving God, which is what we oppose. At the same time, we also need to know that if someone with sacred authority commits a crime, his sacred authority is already invalid. If we obey him, we will not only have no merit, but also commit a sin.

　　We are working to enable our church to continue to exist on the territory of our motherland. Imperialist elements such as Wen Guibin, Zheng Huamin, and Bu Xiangxian are very clear that they know that the Chinese people have awakened and they can no longer continue to do whatever they want in China. It is the most painful thing for them to spit out the bread and milk that they have managed to eat. Therefore, they desperately slander the Three-Self Reform Movement. They say it is "apostasy, breaking away from the Pope, and going to hell." We say that the object of reform is imperialism. How can we be considered betraying God if we betray imperialism? Is imperialism God? Is betraying the special agent organization destroying the Holy Church? Betraying imperialism is betraying God. Please see how absurd this is. If we believe this absurd principle, our faith will become a very serious problem. It must be emphasized here that in the early stage of signing, a large number of Catholics were fooled by imperialist elements, followed imperialism, and even did not listen to the words of Chinese priests; they only believed the words of foreign priests. In this stage, the obstruction of imperialist elements was very crazy. Our work was very difficult, and even Chinese priests were attacked and persecuted. For example, Father Hui was forced to swear before the altar with Wen Guibin, some priests were stripped of their power, and the priests who signed first were very distressed, and the Catholics who signed were also very distressed. We feel that our Lord Jesus was nailed to the cross by the Pharisees, and we have only been slandered. For God, this is nothing. Fighting imperialism to the end shows that we are the brave soldiers of Jesus.

　　Here we must mention the "Legion of Mary," especially the die-hard faction in the "Legion of Mary" that willingly attached itself to the enemy, giving a great destruction to the Three-Self Reform Movement. Although the reactionary countercurrent has become a thing of the past, the masses have turned to the Three-Self Reform Movement, isolating the die-hard faction, and the die-hard faction still refuses to sign, and even some shamelessly say: "The head can be broken but the name cannot be signed." He would rather abandon God and follow imperialism, and his faith has become a problem. Wang Junde, the president of Tianjin University, also belongs to this kind of person. These people are the followers of the Pharisees. Wang Junde actually misinterpreted the Three-Self Reform Movement and said: "Three-Self" has long been realized in China. He said: "Foreign imperialist elements control the sovereignty of the church, which is self-government; accepting imperialist subsidies is self-support; and missionary work led by foreign imperialist elements is self-propagation." Not only did he betray the motherland, but also betrayed our church. This fully exposed the true face of the people and believers of imperialism who are willing to submit to the enemy and enslave the Chinese people.

　　Imperialist elements know very well that the rumors they create will soon be crushed by the awakening of the people. Therefore, they came up with a way to save themselves from death, saying, "Sign in Beijing, wait for Beijing to sign together," and that "it should be from top to bottom, and the promotion association should not be started by priests signing." We know that religious sacraments are from top to bottom; in addition, we Catholics have the right to love the church. For example, if imperialism infringes on Catholicism, why can't we launch a movement against imperialism from the standpoint of a Catholic? If the priest does not love the church, will he not allow us to have the freedom to love the church? After the signing was launched, Vice Bishop Zhao posted big-character posters in various parishes. The imperialist element Ning Shoudao (a Dutchman) tore up Vice Bishop Zhao's big-character posters, and said: We cannot listen to the Chinese bishop. Isn't this national discrimination and looking down on the Chinese bishop? Good parishes are occupied by foreigners, and Chinese priests live in thatched huts. Foreign priests must eat Western food, using two workers to serve them, wearing suits, and riding electric motorcycles. Chinese priests have not made clothes for five years, saying that there is no money, the money is in the Netherlands, they can't eat or dress, and they discriminate against Chinese people. Are they sincerely preaching? Father Yang San took the account book to the Netherlands, always saying that there is no account in Xikai, so he said: "The account exists, in the Netherlands." Dutch priests spend money lavishly, always expressing to people that this money is my own, is Zheng Huamin's, not of Xikai Catholic Church. Fellow Catholics will know that priests are in religious poverty, and priests have no private property. Then Dutch priests should not enjoy privately. If it is for the individual Dutch, we suspect the origin of this money, the meaning is not glorious, it may be a special expense for political purposes. I hope that Catholics will unite to check the economy of Xikai, otherwise they will take the money to the Netherlands like Father Yang San, which will destroy our self-support.

　　Thanks to the efforts of the comrades of the Promotion Association and the guidance of the Chinese priests and the cooperation of all the Catholics, everyone gradually recognized the face of imperialism, and the number of signatures increased day by day. As of today, there are more than 15,000 signatures, which proves that the reform movement has achieved preliminary success with the help of all the priests and Catholics. This achievement will make our task even more arduous. We need to know that although we have signed our names, it does not mean that we have completed our reform goals. This is just one step in a long march. Because we have been deceived for hundreds of years, our inner awakening is an arduous task, just like a body that is still very weak after recovering from a serious illness, and we still need to work hard to cultivate it, otherwise, I am afraid it will be difficult to withstand the storm. At the same time, the wolf-like and tiger-like imperialist elements are still trying to swallow us at all times, which we should be vigilant about. Therefore, we put forward the following requirements to all Catholics:

　　1. We must step up our studies, improve our political awareness, support our bodies to become stronger after illness, recognize what is doctrine and what is imperialism, and no longer blindly follow and no longer be used by imperialism.

　　2. Heighten our vigilance and strictly guard against the resurgence of wolf-like and tiger-like imperialist elements. Cultivate our bodies and constantly increase our newborn strength.

　　3. Chinese priests and Catholics must strengthen unity and be wary of imperialist elements sowing discord within us.

### 天津市天主教革新运动促进会成立大会上  聂国屏关于筹备经过的报告

　　天津市天主教革新运动促进会成立大会上
　  聂国屏关于筹备经过的报告主席、诸位首长、来宾、诸位师长教友：
    解放后的新中国是日益强大起来了，天主教在中国也要站立起来了！新中国的壮大，无疑的是首先战胜了帝国主义的侵略。同样，天主教在中国，如不切实斩断与帝国主义的联系，而任其蹂躏下去，不但会危害祖国，就连教的前途也是不堪设想的。因此，在全国的爱国反帝的高潮中，各地的善良教友发动了这一爱国爱教反帝的三自（自治、自养、自传，下同）革新运动。在去年十一月三十日，四川广元王良佐神甫等，首先发表了天主教革新宣言，随即获得全国各地教友们的拥护，纷纷起来响应。就在这样热潮中，天津市由于吴克斋先生等积极的发动，在本年一月十一日成立了天主教革新运动促进会筹备会。并于十三日发表了革新宣言。
    革新运动一开始，便使帝国主义分子卜相贤、郑化民之流，感到惊心动魄，看到自己的权势受到威胁，不能再骑在中国教友的头上作威作福了，于是他们就百般阴谋破坏，妄言：谁签名就是“背教”“犯大罪”、“脱离教宗”，以“停神功”来威吓教友。他们又发出：“天主教内没有帝国主义，也没受过帝国主义的利用”等自欺欺人的谎言，妄图掩盖帝国主义侵略的丑恶史实，以蒙蔽教友。不必远举历史上的实例，如载在不平等条约上的“传教特权”，及一连串的祸国殃民的教案等等，已经可以说明。就以天津市的“西开事件”而言，是杜主教（法国人）假借外国兵来强占老西开，使成为“法国租界”。望海楼的马神甫因为反对法国神甫变卖教产竟被摘了权。西开文贵宾（法国人）恐怕教权落在中国神长的手里，遂招致了大批荷兰神甫来天津占堂口，操大权，尽情享受，而中国神甫受着他们的辖制，贫窘不堪。帝国主义分子硬说荷兰神甫的钱是他们自己的，但是由于教友们的证明，发现整个西开总堂的金钱、物资及账目，全由荷兰神甫把持。据闻西开的总账都已运到荷兰去了。他们说：“天主教内没有帝国主义”，真是撒了个漫天大谎。
    帝国主义分子又阻挠中国神长、教友们在革新宣言上签名，说：“天主教是超政治的，不许神甫参加政治。”但是于斌勾结了美蒋匪帮要来颠覆祖国，与人民为敌，为什么没有被摘权？又如雷振远勾结军统特务，组织“公教报国团”在华北五省三市建立反动组织，进行“策反”“搜情报”和“暗杀”等破坏工作，叫嚣“反苏”，“反共”发动战争。并以匪“北平军统保密局”为通讯站，供给美蒋匪帮情报，又曾在平山县附近谋刺人民领袖。“公教报国团”分为四个大队，由二十五个神甫分担各队的指导司铎，勾引教友发给“八一三”部队番号的通行证，使从事间谍活动。还有最近破获的津沽大学卜相贤、鲍翊华、房如晦等的间谍案，他们暗藏电台与敌通报，又假借宗教号召教友与政府对立，破坏抗美援朝运动。这些罪行，那一件不是以天主教“超政治”的口号作掩护而来进行反动政治活动呢？帝国主义者总把天主教与反人民的反动活动混在一起，把帝国主义的侵略也教我们当信德的道理来信，不信，他就说你下地狱。他们希望美帝国主义投原子弹，希望三次世界大战，希望我们至死不与政府合作。甚至于在一九四九年初，教友参加了庆祝天津解放的游行，梅神甫（荷兰人）都说成是背教下地狱的大罪。我们教友绝大多数是忠诚善良的，加上长期受帝国主义愚弄蒙蔽，过去只知把神长的话当成金科玉律，对于帝国主义分子利用宗教信仰进行特务活动是认不清的。使我们对于神长的错误，不仅不敢指责，甚至不敢想，总认为心里稍为一想，就是犯了侮辱神长的大罪。比如津沽大学师生签名要求撤卜相贤的职，卜相贤对公教生说：“谁签名撵神甫就是犯大罪”。我们反奥斯汀谰言，都要“背教”“下地狱”。也就是说反对了奥斯汀，就是反对了天主，难道帝国主义就是天主，天主就是帝国主义吗？！帝国主义分子是很狡滑奸诈的，他们知道我们对于他的盲从崇拜，是掩护他的特务活动最好的保证，因此总把它的特务活动让教友当信德的道理来信，要把特务组织成为教内组织，要我们参加了这个反动组织进行反动活动。这样他们便不说是犯罪，得罪天主了，而相反的说这是热心恭敬天主，为天主效命。比如雷振远的特务组织“公教报国团”要加上一个“公教”二字，就是掺上宗教信仰，好使我们忠心耿耿，为帝国主义效死服务的。这是帝国主义一贯的把戏，利用宗教进行侵略阴谋的铁证。但是我们教友们不少受到帝国主义的愚弄，仍给它当传话筒说：“天主教根本未受帝国主义利用，根本无关系，自然谈不到斩断关系”。又如“公教报国团”第二大队长金玉培，在解放后要向政府坦白、登记，其指导司铎刘西满神甫制止他说：“你登记坦白，就是破坏圣教会”，以教义吓住了金玉培，金仍从事特务活动。从刘西满这句话里，使人感觉背叛了特务活动，就是叛了教，那么天主教就是特务组织，特务组织也就是天主教了！使社会人士都看成天主教是特务，这个天主教还能存在吗？这也就很明显了，今天天主教落到这般田地，完全是这些帝国主义分子招来的。也就是说，谁害了我们教呢？毫无疑问的是帝国主义分子，不是社会人士，更不是政府没有信仰自由。因此很明显的不是信仰问题，而是我们教内与帝国主义关系问题。客观的表现，是教会、特务不分，这是每个爱国人士所痛心疾首的，也是站起来了的中国人民所不容许的。这就是天主教在新中国的社会地位的实际情况。因此摆在我们教友眼前的一个重大任务，就是我们的这个天主教还要不要的问题，如果还要这个教，爱这个教，还希望这个教仍然在社会继续存在的话，那么必须与帝国主义切断联系才能得到社会谅解。我们的三自革新运动，就是从这个目的这个基础上出发的。有人又提出：他是神长，不能反对他。我们需要知道，我们是爱教还是爱帝国主义，我们要“一钦崇于天主万有之上”，不能“一钦崇帝国主义万有之上”。我们为了某一帝国主义分子个人问题把教弄垮了，那是爱帝国主义超过了爱天主的行动，这是我们所反对的。同时我们还需要知道，有神权的犯罪，他的神权已经是无效了，我们服从他，不仅无功，反而有罪的。
    我们是为了使我们的教，能在祖国的领土上继续存在。帝国主义分子文贵宾、郑化民、卜相贤之流是很清楚的，他们知道中国人觉醒了，他们不能继续在中国作威作福了，好容易吃到嘴里的面包、牛奶再吐出来，这是他们最痛心的事情。因此拼命诬蔑三自革新运动。他们说是“叛教脱离教宗下地狱”。我们说革新对象是帝国主义，我们背叛了帝国主义怎能算是背叛了天主呢？帝国主义是天主吗？背叛了特务组织是破坏了圣教会吗？背叛了帝国主义就是背叛了天主，请看这是多么荒谬的道理。如果我们相信了这个荒谬道理，我们的信德就成了很严重的问题了。在这里要着重说明：在签名初期，有很大一部分教友受了帝国主义分子愚弄，跟着帝国主义走，甚至连中国神甫的话也不听了；只有外国神甫的话才信。在这一阶段帝国主义分子的阻挠是很疯狂的。我们的工作是很艰苦的，甚至中国神甫也受了打击与迫害，如回神甫被迫与文贵宾在祭台前起誓，有的神甫被摘了权，先签名的神甫很苦恼，签名的教友也很苦恼。我们觉得吾主耶稣是被法利赛人钉死在十字架上，而我们仅仅受了诬蔑，为了天主，这算不了什么。与帝国主义分子斗争到底，才显出我们是耶稣的勇兵。
    在这里我们不得不提出“圣母御侍团”，特别是“圣母御侍团”中间的死硬派甘心附敌，给予三自革新运动的破坏是很大的。今天虽然反动逆流已成过去，群众倒向了三自革新运动，孤立了死硬派，死硬派仍坚不肯签名，甚至有的恬不知耻的说：“头可断而名不能签”。他宁愿背弃天主而跟着帝国主义走，他的信德已成了问题。津沽大学校长王峻德也是属于这一流人物的，这些人是法利赛人的党徒。王峻德竟曲解三自革新运动说：“三自”在中国早实现了，他说：“外籍帝国主义分子把持教会主权，就是自治；接受帝国主义津贴，就是自养；以外籍帝国主义分子为主的传教，就是自传。”不仅出卖了祖国，而且出卖了我们教会，这充分暴露了甘心附敌分子及帝国主义奴役中国人民及教徒的真面目。
    帝国主义分子，明知自己造出的谣言很快会被人民的醒觉粉碎的，因此就想出了挽救自己死亡的办法说“到北京签名，等北京一齐签名”，什么“应由上而下的，促进会不是神长签起的”。我们知道宗教圣事才是由上而下；此外，我们教友是有爱教的权利的，比如帝国主义侵害了天主教，我们以教友的立场，为何不可发起反对帝国主义的运动呢！如果神长不爱教，也不许我们有爱教的自由吗？签名展开以后，赵副主教在各堂口贴了大字报，帝国主义分子宁守道神甫（荷兰人）把赵副主教的大字报给撕了，并且说：我们不能听中国主教的话。这不是民族歧视，瞧不起中国主教吗？好堂口都是外国人占着，中国神甫住茅屋。外国神甫非吃西餐不可，用着两个伺候自己的工人，穿西服，骑磨电驴子。中国神甫已经五年没做衣服，说没有钱，钱在荷兰，吃不上穿不上，歧视中国人，他们这是纯心传教吗？杨三神甫把账本带到荷兰去了，总说西开没有账，所以说：“账是有，在荷兰哩”。荷兰神甫花钱挥霍，总向人表示，这钱是我自己的，是郑化民的，不是西开天主堂的。诸位教友都会知道，神甫是神贫的，神甫没有私人财产。那么荷兰神甫就不应当私人享受。如果是给荷兰人个人的，则我们很怀疑这钱的来历，那意义是很不光明的，很可能是政治作用的特别费。希望教友团结起来，检查西开的经济，不然他们要和杨三神甫一样的把钱带去荷兰，那就破坏我们的自养了。
    经过促进会诸同人的努力及中国神长的指导和全体教友的协力，大家逐渐认清帝国主义的面目，签名的日见增多。截至今天，已有一万五千余人的签名，这是证明革新运动在诸位神长教友的协助下，获得了初步成就。这种成就，使我们的任务，将更加繁重。我们需要知道，虽然签了名，并不等于完成了我们的革新目的，这不过是万里长征走了一步。由于我们受了数百年的蒙蔽，我们内心的醒觉，是一个艰巨的工作，犹如大病初愈身体还是很弱的，还需要我们努力善养，不然，恐难经得起暴风雨的。同时如狼似虎的帝国主义分子，还时时刻刻的想吞食我们，这是我们应当警惕的。因此我们向全体教友提出以下几点要求：
    一、要加紧学习，提高自己的政治觉悟，扶养我们病后的身体强壮起来，认清那是教义，那是帝国主义的东西，今后不再盲从，不再受帝国主义所利用。
    二、提高警惕严防如狼似虎的帝国主义分子重新复辟。培养我们的身体，时时增加我们新生的力量。
    三、中国神长及教友要加强团结，警惕帝国主义分子对我们内部的挑拨离间。
