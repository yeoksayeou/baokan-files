Catholic Monk Li Maode's Accusation Against Imperialist Elements

Catholic monk and student of Kaiyang Huayang Middle School, Li Maode, accuses the imperialist elements within the Catholic Church of their crimes. Teachers and students from four schools in Kaifeng City, including the Christian church schools Zhenguang Shiyu Middle School and Yuzhong Middle School, and the Catholic church schools Huayang Middle School and Jingyi Girls' Middle School, held a meeting on March 24th and 26th to accuse imperialist elements of using churches and church schools to carry out aggression. At the meeting, Li Maode accused:

	We Chinese monks have been deprived of our human rights and freedom by imperialist elements. The imperialist elements in the Kaifeng Catholic Church, Italian Bishop Yang Lin and Father Gao Muling, divided us monks into groups of three, and we were not allowed to speak when two people were together. We had no freedom of speech, nor did we have freedom of movement. During our spare time, we were not allowed to leave the school gate without their permission. We also had no freedom of correspondence. Letters we sent home or letters we received from home had to be checked by them. Once, a letter was sent to me from home, and at the end of the letter was the sentence "Wishing you progress in your thinking." The imperialist element Gao Muling said after reading it, "In the future, letters from home are not allowed to write anything about progress in thinking." We also had no freedom to read progressive newspapers and magazines. They only allowed us to read reactionary pamphlets published by the "Hong Kong Truth Publishing House," which were full of anesthetizing, reactionary, and distorting things. They completely deprived us of our time outside of regular classes, locked us in the church to chant scriptures, and listened to their reactionary propaganda, not allowing us to have any extracurricular activities. Last semester, I scored 80 on my political class exam, and the imperialist element Yang Lin was unhappy when he heard about it and satirized me with words. When we sang the progressive song "Fight to the End," Father Yong Shixi scolded us. They made us believers only know the Vatican and not the country; only know how to chant scriptures and not love the country. Imperialist elements used such insidious methods to anesthetize and deceive us.

	They did not allow us to participate in any political activities, student unions, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and even less allowed us to participate in the New Democratic Youth League. Last semester, a church member from Ningling, Zhang Jiuliang, came to Huayang Middle School to study. He was a member of the Youth League. Yang Lin did not allow him to admit that he was a member of the Youth League, but he was not successful. Therefore, at the end of last semester, Yang Lin sent a letter to his family, not allowing him to come back to school, and now he is out of school.

	The imperialist elements Yang Lin and Gao Muling also frequently spread reactionary remarks that slandered our country and deceived our people. He insisted that Yu Bin, the Kuomintang's secret agent leader and a scoundrel of the Catholic Church, was a good person. They also promoted war to the believers, creating terror. During Christmas last year, Yang Lin said to the believers: "1951 is the year of the Third World War. This war will be very brutal. You (referring to the believers) must chant scriptures well and ask God to bless you."

	The imperialist elements Yang Lin and Gao Muling also tried every possible means to obstruct and undermine the "Three-Self Patriotic Movement." When the patriotic and reform movement in religious circles spread to Kaifeng, the patriotic believers in the Kaifeng Catholic Church signed in response, but the imperialist elements Yang Lin and Gao Muling, who manipulated the Catholic Church, tried every means to sabotage it. Because I wanted to respond to this reform movement, the imperialist element Gao Muling threatened me: "If you respond to this reform movement, you will be a 'religious traitor,' and your supply will be cut off, and you will lose your school." They also distributed a reactionary "Learning Reference" to each believer, and Gao Muling himself gave believers slanderous and distorted explanations. I love my country and also love my religion. I will never be deceived by imperialist elements. I long for the Chinese Church to no longer be manipulated by imperialist elements and to be run by the Chinese themselves. I know that responding to the reform movement is by no means a "schism" or a "religious betrayal," but on the contrary, it is loving the religion. Therefore, I was not intimidated, and I resolutely responded to the reform movement. The imperialist elements shamelessly, in the name of responding to the reform movement as "religious betrayal," illegally expelled me from the church, did not allow me to be a monk, cut off my supply, and cursed that I would definitely go to hell in the future. However, I am a Chinese, and I am not afraid of anything. The imperialist elements' expulsion of my religious status is completely illegal. I will fight to the end for the reform movement of the Catholic Church. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 天主教修士李茂德对帝国主义分子的控诉

　　天主教修士李茂德对帝国主义分子的控诉
    天主教修士、开封华阳中学学生李茂德控诉天主教中的帝国主义分子的罪行。开封市基督教教会学校真光施育中学、豫中中学，天主教教会学校华阳中学，静宜女子中学等四个学校师生于三月二十四、二十六两日召开了控诉帝国主义分子利用教会和教会学校进行侵略活动的大会。会上李茂德控诉说：
    我们中国修士被帝国主义分子剥夺了人权，剥夺了自由。开封天主教帝国主义分子意籍主教阳霖和神甫高牧灵，把我们修士划为三人小组，两个人在一起是不准说话的。我们没有说话的自由，我们也没有行动的自由，在课余的时间，是不准走出学校大门的，要出去必须得到他们的允许。我们也没有通信的自由，我们给家里去的信，或家里给我们来的信，都必须经过他们的检查。有一次家中给我寄来了一封信，信的最后有“祝思想进步”的一句话。帝国主义分子高牧灵看了后就说：“以后家中来信，不准再写什么思想进步。”我们也没有看进步书报的自由，他们只让我们看反动的“香港真理出版社”出版的小册子，这些小册子充满了麻醉人的、反动的、歪曲事实的东西。他们把我们正课以外的时间完全给剥夺了，把我们关在教堂里面念经，听他们的反动宣传，不使我们有任何课外活动。上学期我的政治课考了八十分，帝国主义分子阳霖一听到就不高兴，用话讽刺我。我们唱进步歌子《打到底》，雍时熙神甫就骂我们。他们使我们教徒只知有梵蒂冈，不知有国家；只知念经，不知爱国。帝国主义分子就是用这种阴险的手段来麻醉和欺骗我们的。
    他们不准我们参加任何政治活动，不准参加学生会，不准参加中苏友好协会，更不准许参加新民主主义青年团。上学期，宁陵的一位教友张九亮来华阳中学上学，他是个青年团员。阳霖不许他承认是青年团员，但是没有成功。因此在上学期结束后，阳霖就给他家去信，不让他再来上学，现在他失学了。
    帝国主义分子阳霖、高牧灵还经常散布诬蔑我们国家和欺骗我们人民的反动言论。他硬说国民党的特务头子、天主教的败类于斌是好人。他们还向教徒宣传战争，制造恐怖。阳霖在去年圣诞节时，就向教徒说：“一九五一年是第三次世界大战的一年。这次战争非常残酷。你们（指教徒）要好好地念经，求神保佑。”
    帝国主义分子阳霖、高牧灵又千方百计阻挠和破坏“三自运动”。当宗教界的爱国主义革新运动传到开封后，开封的天主教中的爱国教徒签名响应了，但操纵天主教的帝国主义分子阳霖、高牧灵，却想尽方法，从中破坏。我因为要响应这个革新运动，帝国主义分子高牧灵就威胁我说：“你若是响应了这个革新运动，你就是“叛教”，就断绝你的供给，你就要失学。”他们还发给每个教徒一本反动的《学习参考》，并由高牧灵亲自给教徒作诬蔑与歪曲的讲解，我爱祖国，也爱教，我决不受帝国主义分子的欺骗，我渴望着中国教会不再受帝国主义分子的操纵，而由中国人自己来办。我知道响应革新运动，绝不是“裂教”，更不是“叛教”，相反的正是爱教。所以，我没有被吓倒，我坚决地响应了革新运动。帝国主义分子无耻地以响应革新运动就是“叛教”的名义，非法地把我开除教会，不准我当修士，并断绝了我的供给，咒我将来一定要下地狱。但是，我是一个中国人，我什么也不怕。帝国主义分子开除我的教籍，是完全非法的。我要为天主教会的革新运动斗争到底。（新华社）
