　　Reflections on Participating in Land Reform Work
　　Professor of Tsinghua University Wu Jingchao
　　Our Northwest China Land Reform Visiting Group left Beijing on February 8th and spent about a month in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, observing land reform and participating in some work during the visit. The visiting group returned to Beijing on March 15th. The visiting group has already written a summary of what we learned during this month, so I won't repeat it here. What I want to talk about now is the impact of this study on my personal thoughts and feelings.
　　Chairman Ma Mingfang said: "The entire land reform process is a process of mobilizing the masses, a process in which the broad masses of peasants struggle against the landlord class and constantly improve their class consciousness in the struggle." I didn't fully understand this sentence before. It wasn't until I lived in Dongda Village in the Five-Star District of Chang'an for a week and included myself in the ranks of the peasants that I understood that land reform was a fierce struggle, and indeed, it could improve one's consciousness in the struggle. After liberation, we also studied class viewpoints and mass viewpoints, but the gains from two years of study seemed less profound than one month of practice. In the school environment, there is no sharp class struggle, no enthusiastic mass movement. It is not easy to acquire class viewpoints and mass viewpoints in such an environment. The rural environment where land reform is carried out is very different. The first step in land reform is to organize a broad anti-feudal united front to fight against the landlord class. At this time, the position of every peasant in the countryside is not allowed to be vague. In the two camps, in the feudal camp and the anti-feudal camp, which side are you on? Who do you support and who do you oppose? Everyone needs to make a decisive answer to these questions, even the landlord's son, who is studying in middle school, is pursuing this answer, causing him to lose sleep for several nights. In this atmosphere of struggle, each of us learned the class viewpoint more clearly, integrated with the peasants, regarded the problems of the peasants as our own problems, contributed our own strength, and struggled with the peasants against the landlords, and we were tempered and gained a sense of emotional and moral unity with the peasants in the struggle. In the same struggle, we realized the mass viewpoint even more. In schools, teaching and research work is mostly carried out in an isolated, small-scale handicraft manner. This loose and closed-door self-study method is also not conducive to developing a mass viewpoint. However, in the rural areas where land reform is carried out, no matter what the matter or what the step, it is bound to fail if it is separated from the masses. It is unimaginable to carry out land reform single-handedly. A series of tasks, from consolidating the peasant association to holding grievance meetings, fighting against local bullies, investigating fields, and assessing class status, all require gathering the strength of the masses, repeatedly consulting and discussing with the masses, in order to complete them satisfactorily. The wisdom of the masses is higher than the wisdom of individuals, and it is also demonstrated very thoroughly and clearly in various struggle occasions. Therefore, the petty-bourgeois mentality of arrogance is reduced and even disappears in the face of the great power of the masses. On the one hand, realizing the limitations of personal ability, on the other hand, discovering an inexhaustible source of wisdom in the masses, one will sincerely learn to follow the mass line.
　　Before this, we often talked about land reform in schools, and even lectured on land reform in large classes. After a month of practice, what are the differences in understanding? I think the most different point is that in the past, talking about land reform only had rational content, but now talking about land reform has added some emotional content. In the past, it was just a cold analysis and textual scrutiny, but now it is full of love for the peasants and hatred for the landlords, and land reform is regarded as a matter closely related to oneself. This emotional content was obtained by participating in the anti-landlord struggle together with the peasants. The experience this time proves that a rational and emotional understanding can only be obtained in practice. Therefore, we have learned a lesson, that is, those who do teaching and research work should seize every opportunity to participate in mass movements, educate themselves from mass movements, improve their thinking, and temper their emotions. Reading behind closed doors can at most make one a semi-intellectual, and in the era of new democracy, the use of semi-intellectuals is very limited.
　　Beijing has been liberated for more than two years, and during this period, we have increased our understanding of the central cadres. However, we don't know much about the quality of local cadres. This time in Chang'an County, we got an opportunity to hear six major reports, all related to the first phase of land reform in Chang'an County. The speakers were all county-level cadres. We were infinitely admired by their clear analysis and vivid narration. In a conversation, I asked a county party secretary to provide me with materials on the educational level of county-level cadres in Chang'an County. To our surprise, none of these cadres had ever attended university. But we all felt that if any one of those who gave the major reports were invited to teach a large class at a university, their results would exceed those of any professor in the university who had read many masterpieces by Marx and Lenin. Later, we went to Dongda Village to carry out land reform work, and the leader of the work team was a 25-year-old district party secretary. His humble and amiable attitude, his spirit of seeking truth from facts, his grasp of policies, which was so correct and firm, and his handling of problems, which was so thorough and comprehensive, all made us middle-aged people feel the warmth of the phrase "learning from young people". I remember once, after reviewing many of the past mistakes of the old peasant association director, we all advocated removing the director from his post and expelling him from the association. This young work team leader, however, advocated retaining his membership and reforming and educating him in the peasant association. After reasoning with us for an hour, we were all convinced by his reasoning. He was busy from morning till night, devoting his entire life to the work of land reform. He spoke to the masses, to the peasant association, and to the cadres several times a day. From so many of his talks, we could not find him making a single principled mistake. In a short period of time, we developed sincere respect and love for this young district party secretary. We think that there must be tens of millions of such cadres distributed throughout China. This is a miracle that has never appeared in history. The reason why this miracle was created is of course due to Chairman Mao's leadership and the education of the Chinese Communist Party. The existence of these cadres, on the one hand, has increased our love and respect for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and on the other hand, has filled us with confidence in China's bright and great future.
　　The day we arrived in Dongda Village, the peasants lined up to welcome us five miles away. When we returned to Xi'an from Dongda Village, the peasants of the whole village were reluctant to leave us. My landlord, that kind and honest elder of seventy-three years old, sent me out of the north gate. The other peasants not only sent us out of the village, but also sent us out of the township, until we all got into the carriage, and then waved goodbye and returned. Our emotions fluctuated, and we all thought, the millet we ate in the past was all cultivated by these peasants with hard work. What merits and virtues did we have in the past that they should treat us with such deep affection and kindness? The main reason is that the peasants felt that we were from Beijing. And Beijing, in the minds of the peasants, is inseparable from Chairman Mao. People who go from Chairman Mao will surely bring them happiness, and the peasants deeply believe this intuitively. We must cherish this friendship and trust of the peasants, and repay them with actions, just as they said in their letter to Chairman Mao that they would repay Chairman Mao's kindness with actions. Our future work should be closer to the people and integrated with the people's cause. In the past, our research work often started from interest, but in the future, it should start from the needs of the people. The needs of the people, at this stage, are to consolidate national defense, develop production, and improve living standards. Our work should be coordinated with these needs and meet these needs. From now on, we will more enthusiastically join the ranks of the people, keep pace with the people, and strive for the realization of a new democratic society under the great banner of Mao Zedong.

### 参加土地改革工作的心得

　　参加土地改革工作的心得
    清华大学教授  吴景超
    我所参加的西北区土地改革参观团，于二月八日离开北京，在陕西长安县参观土地改革约一个月，并在参观的过程中，参加了一些工作。参观团已于三月十五日返抵北京。这一个多月学习所得，参观团已经写了一个总结，这儿不再赘述。我现在要说的，就是这一次的学习，对于我个人思想上及感情上的影响。
    马明方主席说：“整个土地改革过程，就是一个发动群众的过程，就是广大农民向地主阶级进行斗争并在斗争中不断地提高自己阶级觉悟的一个过程。”这一句话，我在以前是不十分了解的。一直到我在长安五星区的东大村住了一个星期，并把自己编在农民的队伍中之后，我才了解土地改革是一场激烈的斗争，而在斗争中的确可以提高自己的觉悟。在解放以后，我们也学过阶级观点与群众观点，但两年的学习，其所得似不如一个月的实践为深刻。在学校的环境中，没有尖锐的阶级斗争，没有热烈的群众运动。想在这样的环境中获得阶级观点与群众观点，不是一件容易的事。进行土地改革的农村环境，与此大不相同。土地改革的第一步，就是要组织广大的反封建统一战线，与地主阶级作斗争。此时乡村中每一农民的立场不许模糊。在两个阵营里，在封建阵营与反封建阵营里，你是站在那一边？你是拥护谁、反对谁？这些问题，每一个人都需要作一决定性的答案，连地主的儿子，在中学读书的，也在追求这个答案而致几晚的失眠。在这种斗争的气氛之下，我们每一个人都更明确地学会了阶级观点，与农民打成一片，把农民的问题看成自己的问题，贡献出自己的力量，随同农民与地主进行斗争，并在斗争中得到锻炼，得到与农民在感情上与道义上一致的感觉。也在同样的斗争中，我们更体会到群众观点。在学校中，教学与研究的工作，大部分还是以小手工业的孤立方式进行的。这种散漫的、闭门自修的工作方式，也是不易养成群众观点的。但在进行土地改革的农村中，不问那一件事，那一步骤，如离开群众，必然是办不通。单枪匹马的搞土地改革，可以说是不可想像的事。自整顿农会，以至开诉苦会，反恶霸斗争，清查田亩，评定成份等一系列的工作，都要集合群众的力量，与群众反复商量讨论，才可以圆满完成。群众的智慧，高于个人的智慧，也在各种斗争的场合中，表现得非常透彻而明显，因此小资产阶级那种自高自大的心理，在群众的伟大力量之前，也就由减低以至于消失了。一方面认识个人能力之有限，一方面在群众的身上，发现了取之不尽的智慧泉源，便会诚心诚意的学习走群众路线了。
    在此以前，我们在学校中也常谈土地改革，甚至在大课中也讲过土地改革。经过一个月的实践，认识有何不同呢？我想最不同的一点，就是以前谈土地改革，只有理智的内容，而现在谈土地改革，则添了一些感情的内容。以前只是冷静的分析，条文的推敲，现在则充满了对于农民的爱，对于地主的恨，把土地改革看作与自己血肉相关的一件事情。这点感情的内容，是由于与农民共同参加反地主的斗争而获得的。理性与感情相融洽的认识，根据这一次的经验，证明只有在实践中才可获得。因此，我们得到一个教训，就是做教书及研究工作的人，应当争取一切的机会，参加群众运动，从群众运动中教育自己，提高自己的思想，锻炼自己的感情。闭门读书，最多只能做到一个半知识分子，而在新民主主义时代，半知识分子的用处是很少的。
    北京解放了两年多，我们在这个时期内，对于中央的干部，增加了许多认识。但是地方干部的素质如何，我们知道得不多。这次在长安县，得到一个机会，听到六次大报告，都是与长安县第一期土地改革有关的。作报告的人，都是县级干部。我们对于他们分析的清楚，叙述的生动，感到无限的钦佩。在谈话的时候，我曾请一位县委书记，供给我关于长安县级干部教育程度的材料。很令我们吃惊的，就是这些干部，没有一个是进过大学的。但是我们都觉得，如请那些作大报告的任何一人到大学来教大课，其成绩都会超过大学中念过许多马克思、列宁名著的任何一位教授。后来我们到东大村去进行土地改革工作，工作组的领导者，是一位年方二十五岁的区委书记。他那种谦虚和蔼的态度，实事求是的精神，把握政策，是那样正确而坚定，处理问题，是那样周到而全面，都令我们这些中年的人，感到“向青年学习”这句话的亲切。记得有一次在检讨旧农会主任的许多过失之后，我们都主张撤消这位主任的职务，并开除他的会籍。这位年轻的工作组长，却主张保留他的会籍，留在农会中改造他，教育他。在同我们作了一点钟的说理之后，我们都为他的道理所说服了。他一天从早忙到晚，把整个的生命，投在土地改革的工作中。他对群众，对农会，对干部，每天都要讲几次话，从他那么多的谈话次数中，我们找不到他有一次犯原则性的错误。在短短的时期中，我们对于这位年轻的区委书记，发生了诚挚的敬爱。我们想，像这样的干部，分布在中国各地的，当以千万计。这是历史上从来没有出现过的奇迹。这种奇迹的所以造成，当然要归功于毛主席的领导及中国共产党的教育。这些干部的存在，使我们一方面对于毛主席及共产党加增了爱戴，一方面对于中国的光明而伟大的前途，充满了信心。
    我们到东大村的那一天，农民排队到五里之外来迎接我们。在由东大村折回西安的时候，全村的农民，和我们依依不舍。我的房东，那位七十三岁的忠厚长者，一直送我出了北门。其余的农民，不但送我们出村，而且还送我们出乡，直到我们都坐上了马车，才摇手告别而返。我们的感情都起了波动，心中都在想，我们过去所吃的小米，都是这些农民辛苦耕耘得来的，我们对于他们过去曾有何功何德，值得他们如此的深情厚谊？主要的原因，还是因为农民觉得我们是由北京去的。而北京，在农民的心目中，是与毛主席分不开的。从毛主席那儿去的人，必会带给他们以幸福，农民都这样直觉地深信着。我们要珍重农民这点情谊与信任，要以行动来报答他们，正如他们在给毛主席的信中，说是要以行动来报答毛主席的恩情一样。我们以后的工作，更要向人民靠拢，要与人民的事业打成一片。过去我们对于研究工作，常从兴趣出发，以后应当从人民的需要出发。人民的需要，在现阶段，是巩固国防，发展生产，提高生活。我们的工作，就应当配合这些需要，满足这些需要。从今以后，我们将更踊跃的投入人民的队伍，与人民齐一步伐，在毛泽东伟大的旗帜之下，为实现新民主主义的社会而奋斗。
