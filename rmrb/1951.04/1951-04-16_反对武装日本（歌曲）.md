Title: Oppose the Arming of Japan (Song)

Editor's note: This song was previously published in our newspaper on April 8th and in the twelfth issue of the "Current Affairs Handbook" published on April 5th, but there are discrepancies between the two. The reason is that the version published in the "Current Affairs Handbook" was the initial draft, and the version published in our newspaper on April 8th was the author's first revised draft. It has now been finalized by the author. We hope that when singing and reprinting this song, you will use the version published in today's newspaper as the standard.

In addition, the melody above the words "打垮了" (dǎ kuǎ le, "defeated") in the sixth bar of the song "全世界人民团结紧" (quán shì jiè rén mín tuán jié jǐn, "People of the World, Unite Tightly") published in our newspaper on April 1st and in the twelfth issue of the "Current Affairs Handbook" should be 666. This is also corrected. (Song attached)

    反对武装日本
    编者按：这首歌曾发表在四月八日本报及四月五日出版的“时事手册”第十二期，但两者有出入。原因是“时事手册”所发表者为初稿，四月八日本报发表者为作者第一次修改稿，现已由作者最后加以修改。希望各地学唱及翻印时，根据今日本报所刊者为准。
    又，四月一日本报及“时事手册”第十二期所载“全世界人民团结紧”一歌第六小节“打垮了”三字上的曲调，应为666，一并更正。（附歌曲）
