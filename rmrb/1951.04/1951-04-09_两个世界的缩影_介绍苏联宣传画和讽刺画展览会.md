　　A Miniature of Two Worlds
　  —An Introduction to the Soviet Propaganda Poster and Satirical Drawing Exhibition
　　Cai Ruohong
　  A window facing the world has opened before us, and from here, we can survey two different worlds, one old and one new. On one side is the fortress defending world peace, the Soviet Union, creating happiness for mankind. Here are brilliant revolutionary teachers and the outstanding working people under their leadership, who have presented boundless loyalty and unparalleled creativity to the cause of peaceful construction; they have already achieved splendid and enormous achievements, and now, they are marching towards a communist society. Here are the milestones they have traveled, the indicators of their work, and the spiritual outlook, full of victorious confidence, that is unique to the Soviet people. On the other side, however, is the garbage can of the old world, spreading the plague of war, where a small group of warmongers, arms merchants, Wall Street bosses, blood-drinking executioners, and their lackey vassals gather. They are constantly creating conspiracies, instigating wars, and committing murder and arson. They exploit and betray each other, but they face a common, ominous fate. Some have already completed their historical journey, while others are still struggling in crooked dead ends!
　  The Soviet Propaganda Poster and Satirical Drawing Exhibition currently being held in Beijing is just like such a window, allowing us to see a miniature of two worlds and to see two different developments and inevitable outcomes. Thanks to our Soviet painters, who possess high political literacy and artistic expression skills, they have, through these visualized works, blown the horn for the working people advancing towards the new world and also conducted a merciless dissection of the rulers of the old world.
　  I think the Chinese people are fully capable of understanding the entire content of this exhibition and will be even more interested in the content of the propaganda posters. This is not only because we are very familiar with our advanced friendly neighbor, the Soviet Union, but also because there has always been a deep revolutionary bloodline between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and there are inseparable links in the struggles of building new countries and defending peace. Therefore, the Chinese people not only understand the Soviet Union from these paintings but can also see themselves from these paintings; not only can they see the present, but they can also see the future; these paintings are blueprints that have long existed in our hearts!
　  Our Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers, you have crossed the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Qiongzhou Strait in the process of liberating all of China, and you will inevitably cross over to Taiwan. Your lips have been invigorated by the drops of water from these liberated rivers and seas of the motherland, so you will inevitably understand the feelings of the Red Army comrades who "drank deeply of the Dnieper River water" after driving away the German fascist bandits. Similarly, you have long prepared your equipment, just like the Soviet Red Army that "marched to Berlin," preparing to "march to Taiwan." After the alarm bell of American imperialist aggression in Korea rang, our Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers, you deeply understood the lofty emotions contained in the painting "Soldier, Ukraine is waiting for you!" You will also hear the call of "Soldier, save us!" from the mouths of harmed children and women, and you will save the fate of those mothers who cry out, "My son, you have seen my destiny…" Therefore, you set off for Korea, which was being invaded, because defending Korea also meant "defending the motherland." You, like the Soviet Red Army depicted in these paintings, will "eliminate an enemy with every bullet" and "place all hope in you." You gloriously guard the People's Republic of China, just like the Red Army in the painting "I Serve the Soviet Union" who expresses arrogance towards the enemy!
　  Our Chinese working brothers will feel particularly fond of the propaganda posters depicting Soviet workers. Because you are now the masters of New China, you fully understand "the future years must be lived like this," and you must work harder to "increase production" and "manufacture high-quality products" to realize "the future years" as soon as possible. Aren't the goals of the advanced Soviet workers in these paintings the same as your goals today! Moreover, you already have the demands and achievements of "over-fulfilling tasks" and "completing production plans ahead of schedule." Why can't these paintings be your own portraits? Also, when you see the smiling face of that Soviet brother with oil-stained hands in "Today's work is done, preparing for tomorrow's work," you will definitely smile, and your emotions will definitely be exchanged, because what you are waiting for is not rest, but a new and happy beginning after rest.
　  Our Chinese peasants who have undergone land reform, these beautiful paintings also record your present and predict your future. You must love those fine varieties of grains, you must love those fat piglets, strong calves, and specially fine-wool sheep. They are lovely, but this is the "combination of science and labor." We cannot wait for the gifts of nature but must slowly cultivate them through scientific study. Of course, you have also made great efforts. You have constantly "fought against disasters," you are also "preparing for high yields," and you have already eagerly "paid grain to the motherland"; and now, you are preparing to move forward, towards the beautiful life in the beautiful pictures.
　  All these propaganda posters mark a common goal: "Moving towards a more happy and more beautiful paradise of life!" This completely coincides with the goals of the Chinese people's efforts. This is not empty talk but a scientific ideal that has been realized and is being strived to be realized. Moreover, the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution has laid a solid foundation for this ideal, and the content of these propaganda posters provides factual evidence for our ideal.
　  All these propaganda posters also illustrate a common fact. Under the great invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism, under the leadership of the great Stalin, life will continue to move forward, and "Stalin is the happiness of the people!" We can see from these paintings the loyalty and love between the Soviet people and their leader, we can see countless flowers, infinite brilliance, an incomparably jubilant national festival, and the united and forward-moving steps of the entire people…. Similarly, we will also think of our Tiananmen Square, our Chairman Mao, and the torrent of our cheering Chinese people, just like the two largest rivers on earth, although with different courses, but flowing together into the sea of happiness.

　  In order to defend our victorious achievements, defend our peaceful construction, and also to defend our lofty ideals, the Chinese people, who have endured much suffering, cannot but pay attention to the tentacles of the invaders reaching out to themselves from dark corners, cannot but see clearly the hideous faces of the enemies, both overt and covert, and cannot but draw heavily on the power of how to prevent war from the experience of war.
　  Soviet satirical drawings have achieved extraordinarily great results in exposing the tricks of the people's deadly enemies, so the Chinese people (especially intellectuals) have become the most enthusiastic readers of Soviet satirical drawings. Among the more than one hundred satirical drawings exhibited this time, many are the author's original manuscripts, and there are also the precious works of the poet and painter Mayakovsky's "ROSTA Windows." Many of these works run through a series of pungent mockeries of the dregs of humanity. People often misunderstand that the characteristic of satirical drawings is merely exaggeration in image, and laughter is the purpose of this exaggeration. In fact, the characteristic of satirical drawings lies in a clever revelation of the essence of the person being depicted. Laughter is not the purpose, but the purpose is to make readers recognize the essence of these things. If the reader laughs, it is precisely the beginning of rising to a rational understanding through the infection of the correct image.
　  Kukryniksy are the most familiar friends to Chinese readers, and they have presented a large number of works here, including the "American-style cooperation" that exposes the Atlantic Alliance, the "Toad Hatching Eggs" that exposes Tito's conspiracy, and the "War Plague Has Arrived" that satirizes Montgomery's trip to Norway…. These subjects are all dissected using the most suitable methods of expression, allowing readers to gain a deep understanding from these images.
　  Another friend familiar to Chinese readers is Yefimov, whose works have been circulating in China for a long time. "Chiang Kai-shek in His Last Post" is a prophetic work that clearly conveys the relationship between American imperialism and its Chinese running dogs. Secondly, such as "From This Cliff to That Cliff," "Closely Glued Anglo-American Interests," "MacArthur's Japanese Guard," etc., all make appropriate explanations for the warmongers and their interrelationships.
　  Many readers laughed heartily after seeing Ganf's "Garbage Partners." This is really worth laughing at, because there is nothing more suitable to compare to the waste in the trash can, and Ganf just found them. Yeliseyev expressed "The Hypocritical Attlee" very skillfully, especially the face of that hypocritical gentleman is very similar. Shamoilov's "Turkish March" is also a work of very strong artistry, which makes readers still have aftertaste after watching it. In short, there are many excellent works in this exhibition. In terms of the use of themes alone, it almost summarizes the entire appearance of the invasion camp, and, more importantly, analyzes their ugly state of disintegration on the road to death. This is a textbook on current affairs, which will add to the confidence and strength of world peace defenders in opposing aggressive wars. We should pay tribute to the Soviet painters who participated in this exhibition, and we need to learn from them even more. (Attached pictures)

　　两个世界的缩影
　  ——介绍苏联宣传画和讽刺画展览会
　　蔡若虹
　  一扇朝向世界的窗户在我们面前敞开了，从这里，我们可以眺望两个新旧不同的世界。一边是保卫世界和平的堡垒，为人类制造幸福的苏联，这里有英明卓绝的革命导师，和在他领导之下的优秀的劳动人民，他们为和平建设事业呈献了无限的忠诚和无比的创造；他们已经获得了辉煌的巨大的成绩，而现在，他们正在向共产主义社会迈进。这里有他们曾经走过的里程，他们工作的指标，和充满了胜利信心的，苏维埃人民所特有的精神风貌。而另一边，却是散播着战争瘟疫的旧世界的垃圾桶，那儿麇集着一小撮战争贩子、军火商人、华尔街的老板、喝人血的刽子手以及他们的走狗附庸，他们成天地在制造阴谋，挑拨战争和杀人放火，他们互相利用又互相倾轧，可是他们却面临着一个共同的不祥的命运。他们有的已经走完了他们的历史路程，有的还正在弯曲的死巷里挣扎！
    目前正在北京举行的苏联宣传画和讽刺画展览会，就正如同这样的一面窗子，它让我们从这里看见两个世界的缩影，也看见两种不同的发展和必然的结局。感谢我们的具有高度政治修养和艺术表现能力的苏联画家们，他们通过这些形象化的作品，一方面给向新世界前进的劳动人民吹起了号角，一方面又给旧世界的统治者们进行了无情的解剖。
    我想，中国人民是完全能够理解这个展览会的全部内容的。而且，对于宣传画的内容将更感兴趣。原因不仅是由于我们对于先进的友邦苏联十分熟悉，而且是由于中苏两国人民之间原来就具有深厚的革命血缘，在新国家的建设和保卫和平事业斗争中都存在着不可分离的联系。因此，中国人民不仅从这些画幅中理解苏联，而且可以从这些画幅中看见自己；不仅是可以看见现在，而且还可以看见将来；这些画幅是早已存在在我们心里的蓝图！
    我们中国人民解放军的战士们，你们在解放全中国的进程中曾经跨过了黄河，跨过了长江，跨过了琼州海峡，而且也必然要跨到台湾。你们的嘴唇都曾经为沾润了这些被解放的祖国的江河大海的水滴而感到振奋，因此，你们就必然体会到赶走了德国法西斯匪徒而“痛饮第聂伯河水”的红军战友的心情；同样，你们老早就准备了征装，就如同“打到柏林去”的苏联红军一样的准备“打到台湾去”；当美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜的警钟敲响了以后，我们的中国人民志愿军的战士们啊，你们是深刻地懂得“战士，乌克兰等着你！”那幅画面所包含的崇高的感情的；你们同样会听见“战士，救救我们！”那出发于被损害的儿童妇女口中的呼声，你们要挽救那些喊着“我的儿子，你看到了我的命运…”的母亲们的厄运；因此，你们向被侵略的朝鲜出发了，因为保卫了朝鲜也就“保卫了祖国”，你们和这些画幅中所表现的苏联红军一样，将“每一颗子弹消灭一个敌人”，将“一切的希望都放在你们身上”，你们光荣地守卫着中华人民共和国，就如同“我为苏维埃联盟服务”画幅里那个对敌人表示傲岸的红军！
    我们中国的工人弟兄们对于描绘苏联工人题材的宣传画是会感到特别喜爱的。因为你们现在是新中国的主人，你们完全懂得“未来的年月要这样的过”，而且要为“未来的年月”的及早实现而更努力于“增加产量”和“制造上等产品”，这些画幅里的苏联先进工人的努力目标，不也就是你们今天努力的目标么！而且，你们也已经有了“超额完成任务”和“提前完成生产计划”的要求和成绩，这些画何尝不可以作为你们自己的肖像？而且，当你们看见“今天的工作完了，准备明天的工作”里面那个揩着油污的双手的满面笑容的苏联弟兄的时候，你们一定也会微笑，你们的感情一定会引起交流，因为你们等待的不是休息，而是休息之后的一个新的愉快的开始。
    我们中国的经过了土地改革的农民们，这些美丽的画幅也记录了你们的现在，同时也预示着你们的将来。你们一定喜爱那些优良品种的谷物，你们一定喜爱那些肥胖的小猪、健壮的牛犊和特种细毛的绵羊。它们是可爱的，但这是“科学和劳动的结合”。我们不可以等待自然的赐予，而是要从科学的学习中慢慢培养出来的。当然，你们也一样地作过极大的努力，你们曾经不断地“和灾害斗争”，你们也“准备着高度收获量”，你们更已经踊跃地“向祖国缴粮”；而现在，你们却要准备着前进，向美丽的图画中的美好的生活前进。
    所有的这些宣传画，都标志着一个共同的目标：“向更为幸福更为美妙的生活乐园前进！”这和我们中国人民的努力目标完全相符。这不是空谈，是已经实现和正在努力实现的科学的理想。而且，中国人民革命的伟大胜利，已经给这种理想奠定了雄厚的基础，这些宣传画的内容，又给我们的理想提供了事实的依据。
    所有的这些宣传画，也都说明着一个共同的事实。在伟大的不可战胜的马恩列斯的旗帜下面，在伟大的斯大林的领导下面，生活将不断地前进，而“斯大林就是人民的幸福！”我们可以从这些画幅中看出苏联人民和领袖之间的忠诚和热爱，我们可以看见了无数的花朵，无限的光辉，无比狂欢的全民的节日，以及全体人民团结一致的向前迈进的步伐……。同样，我们也会联想到我们的天安门，我们的毛主席，我们欢呼着的中国人民的洪流，就如同地球上两支最大的河流，虽然有不同的历程，但是却一同流向幸福的大海。
  ×          ×          ×
    为了保卫我们的胜利果实，保卫我们的和平建设，同时，也为了保卫我们崇高的理想，饱经忧患的中国人民，就不能不注视那些从黑暗角落里伸向自己身边的侵略者的触角，就不能不看清那些明的和暗的敌人的鬼脸，就不能不从战争的经历中大量地发挥如何防止战争的力量。
    苏联的讽刺画在揭露人民死敌的鬼魅技俩上已经获有异常巨大的成绩，因而中国人民（尤其是知识分子）就成为苏联讽刺画的最热忱的读者。在这次展出的一百余幅讽刺画中，有不少是作者的原稿，而且还有诗人兼画家的马雅可夫斯基的《罗斯塔之窗》的名贵的手笔。这些作品有不少是贯穿着一连串的对于人类的渣滓的辛辣的嘲笑。人们常常误会讽刺画的特点仅仅是形象上的夸张，而笑，就是这种夸张的目的。其实，讽刺画的特点是在于被描绘者的本质的一种巧妙的揭露，笑不是目的，目的是要使读者认清这些事物的本质，如果读者笑了，那正是通过正确的形象的感染而上升到理性认识的一个开始。
    库克磊尼克斯是中国读者最熟识的友人，他在这里呈出了大量的作品，这里有揭露大西洋联盟的“美国式的合作”，有揭露铁托的阴谋的“癞蛤蟆孵卵”，有讽刺蒙哥马利到挪威旅行的“战争鼠疫来了”……这些题材都是以最适合的表现方法来进行解剖的，让读者从这些形象中得到深刻的认识。
    另一个为中国读者所熟悉的朋友是叶菲莫夫，他的作品在中国已经流传很久了。“蒋介石在他最后的岗位上”是一幅预言式的作品，它十分明确地传达了美帝国主义者和他的中国走狗之间的关系。其次如“从这个悬崖到那个悬崖”，“密切胶合着的英美利益”，“麦克阿瑟的日本警卫”等等，都给战争贩子们和他们相互之间的关系作了恰当的说明。
    很多读者看了甘夫的“垃圾伙伴”大为发笑，这真是值得嘲笑的，因为再没什么更合适的东西来比拟垃圾箱里的废物，而甘夫恰恰找到了他们。叶里塞夫将“口蜜腹剑的艾德礼”表现得非常巧妙，尤其是那种假道学先生的面孔十分酷肖。沙莫伊洛夫的“土耳其进行曲”也是一幅艺术性非常强烈的作品，它引得读者们看了之后还有回味。总之，这次展出作品中的佳作很多，仅就题材的运用方面，就几乎概括了侵略阵营的全貌，而且更主要的分析了他们在死亡道路上的分崩离析的丑恶状态。这是一册时事教科书，它将增添世界和平保卫者在反对侵略战争中的信心和力量。我们应该向参加这次展览会的苏联画家们致敬，我们更需要向他们学习。（附图片）
