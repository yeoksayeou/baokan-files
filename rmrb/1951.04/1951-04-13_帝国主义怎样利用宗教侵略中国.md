How Imperialism Used Religion to Invade China
　　Xie Xingyao
　　Since the Chinese Christian community issued the "Ways for Chinese Christianity to Work Hard in the Construction of New China" declaration on September 22nd of last year (1950), Christians across the country have widely launched a patriotic movement, declaring their separation from imperialism and implementing "self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation." This self-reliant and innovative movement is a new and bright path for Chinese Christians. However, certain imperialist elements within the church are hostile to this movement. As seen in the secret document "Learning Reference" recently discovered in the Catholic Church (original text in the Guangming Daily on March 13th), it does not admit to having had any connection with imperialism, saying "there is nothing to cut off" and advocating that the "Three-Self Principles should be realized under the leadership of the clergy." This attempt to undermine the Catholic Church's self-reliance, renovation, and patriotic movement has aroused attention and indignation from all sides. Catholic followers, such as Professor Zhang Yushi of JinGu University in his "Talking to Catholic Friends About How to Love the Church" (see Guangming Daily, March 30th) and President Chen Yuan of Fu Jen Catholic University in his "Speech to Catholics at Fu Jen University" (see this newspaper, March 17th), as well as the recent reports by Wu Guangqi, Nie Guoping, and others at the founding meeting of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Committee (see this newspaper, April 9th), are all righteous roars directed at the evidence of imperialist elements sabotaging the Catholic Church. In reality, no one can forget how imperialism used Catholicism and Christianity to invade China and left behind blood-soaked and tearful events in our history.

  I. The Beginning of Imperialism Using the Church as an Instrument of Aggression

　　Catholicism was introduced to China as early as the tenth year of the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty (1582), but it did not develop at that time. In the early and mid-Qing Dynasty, the Manchu government, to prevent the church's illegal activities in China, did not allow Westerners to preach in China. In 1842 (the 22nd year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty), due to the Opium War, China was defeated and the Treaty of Nanjing was signed under the threat of cannons. As a result, a large number of imperialist henchmen—foreign missionaries—poured into China, believing that this was a "turning point," "as if seeing the light of day again." (See Der Lixian's "History of Catholic Missions in China"). In 1844, the United States coerced the Manchu government into establishing the Treaty of Wangxia, which first stipulated that Americans could establish hospitals and churches in Chinese trading ports. Subsequently, France forced the Manchu government to acknowledge protection for French churches in the Treaty of Whampoa. By 1858 (the eighth year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty), in the Anglo-French Allied Forces War, the "Sino-French Treaty of Tianjin" was established, which stipulated that "all Chinese people who are willing to believe in Catholicism and abide by the rules shall not be investigated or punished. All explicit documents banning Catholicism, whether written or engraved, shall be exempted everywhere." From then on, imperialism gained treaty guarantees for preaching in China, and local churches quickly recovered. Thus, the invaders' chess pieces were spread throughout our country. Imperialists used cannons to send missionaries to China in this way.

　　After more than a hundred years of prohibition (during the Kangxi, Yongzheng, Qianlong, and Jiaqing reigns of the Qing Dynasty), these foreign churches experienced this so-called "turning point" and became arrogant, creating the so-called "negotiations for the return of old sites." After the Treaty of Nanjing was signed, the Manchu government was forced to acknowledge that "all Catholic churches built in various provinces during the Kangxi period, except for those that have been converted into temples or residences, need not be investigated. If the original buildings are verified to be true, they shall be returned to the local Catholics." (Edict of the 25th day of the first month of the 26th year of Daoguang). Until 1860 (the tenth year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty), after the Anglo-French Allied Forces, they forced the signing of the "Tianjin Supplementary Treaty," further expanding the scope of "returning old sites," stipulating that "all Catholic churches, schools, cemeteries, fields, and corridors that previously belonged to Catholics should be compensated and handed over to the local Catholics" (Article 6 of the Supplementary Treaty). This aroused disputes between the Chinese people and the priests.

　　Since 1846 (the 26th year of Daoguang), "negotiations for the return of churches" have been the most difficult and serious issue at the time. The reason was that the priests made various unreasonable demands under the pretext of the "order to return old sites." For example, "in various provinces, regardless of whether it hinders public sentiment, they insist on returning the churches. There are also cases where they forcibly point to the magnificent houses of gentry as former churches, forcing the people to retreat, and even arbitrarily demand the handover of places that hinder the system, as well as public halls, guild halls, and temples that are most respected by the gentry and people of the whole area for churches. Even if the church was actually sold by church members in the past, and later sold by the people to each other, it is no longer owned by one person, and there are also cases where the cost of renovation is huge. The priests do not pay the value and force the return. Also, because the houses occasionally collapse, they demand the cost of repair. The people are angry and treat them as enemies." (See the General Administration of Foreign Affairs' "Regulations on the Management of Missionary Affairs" hereinafter referred to as "Regulations on Missionary Affairs"). This was said by the Manchu government, but the actual situation was more than that. If we look at the documents related to the return of churches at that time, such as "Complete Records of Managing Barbarian Affairs," "Catalog of Diplomatic Notes of Various Countries in the Late Qing Dynasty," and the memorials of Li Hongzhang, Liu Rong, and others, there are many documents related to the return of churches. The time is only from 1856 to 1868, and the area covers the north and south. These negotiations were all initiated by imperialist missionaries based on aggressive treaties and the "order to return old sites" issued by the Manchu government.

　　The Treaty of Nanjing was the beginning of imperialist aggression against China, and the large-scale activities of foreign missionaries in China also began from this point.

  II. The Atrocities of Foreign Missionaries Entering the Interior Without Permission and Interfering in China's Internal Affairs

　　Since imperialism used the church as a base for invading China, some foreign missionaries used political treaties as a background and money as a tool to infringe on China's sovereignty and oppress the Chinese people.

　　First, Western missionaries entered the interior without permission. Although the Treaty of Nanjing and the Sino-American Treaty of Wangxia stipulated that foreigners could only reside in trading ports and could not enter the Chinese interior to preach and trade, imperialists often deliberately violated the treaty and sneaked into the interior. The negotiations caused by their being arrested by local officials in various provinces occurred 35 times in the five years from 1846 to 1850 ("Complete Records of Managing Barbarian Affairs" Daoguang, hereinafter referred to as "Complete Records"). The places where they occurred include Tibet, Sichuan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, and other places. In this short period, foreign missionaries sneaked into our interior and border areas everywhere. In 1850 (the 30th year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty), American missionary Ding Weiliang came to China. He knew that "according to the treaty, he was not allowed to enter the interior" to preach, but he said boldly: "We are commanded by the Lord to preach in all directions, even if there are secular obstacles, how can they stop us?" (Ding Weiliang "Sixty Years of Memories"). At that time, due to the corruption and incompetence of the Manchu government, it was unable to cope with the barbaric demands of Western missionaries and foreign envoys and did not dare to stop them.

　　Second, missionaries, as "China experts," acted as strategists for imperialist aggression against China. They participated in and plotted in secret every time unequal treaties were signed. Everyone knows that the Treaty of Nanjing was the first imperialist shackle placed on China. Rev. Morrison was the first Christian to come to China, but the drafter of this unequal treaty (Treaty of Nanjing) was this Protestant minister, Rev. Morrison. The Chinese draft was written by the famous missionary Guo Shina (Rev Gutelaff), and the Chinese side only slightly modified the wording. This treaty was handled entirely by these two missionaries. Morrison wrote to his wife on July 16, 1843, saying proudly: "I want to tell you that my title is Chinese secretary and translator, with an annual salary of 1,300 pounds. I should wear the uniform of a vice-consul, with royal buttons." (See "Biography of Morrison"). In 1844, the United States sent Caleb Cushing to China to force the Manchu government to sign the "Treaty of Wangxia." The main personnel assisting Cushing in signing the treaty were the earliest American Christian ministers to come to China, Bridgman and Parker. They obtained the rights of five ports for trade, extraterritoriality, preaching rights, and land purchase rights for imperialism. Rev. Bridgman said in his family letter: "We who preach in China are due to political reasons rather than religious reasons." This is his frank confession. Rev. Parker also personally returned to Washington to report to the American senators and representatives on the aggression against China (Guangxuehui Publication: "Liang Fa"). He was officially appointed as the envoy to China in September 1855 because of his meritorious service in invading China, shouldering the overall responsibility for the invasion of China. When the Manchu government revised the treaty with France in 1860 (i.e., the Sino-French Treaty of Beijing), a French missionary accompanied the French envoy as a translator and privately added the sentence "French missionaries are allowed to rent and buy land in various provinces and build as they please" in Chinese (Chen Jie "History of the Yihetuan Movement" hereinafter referred to as "Movement History"). The ignorant Manchu government signed and acknowledged it. In 1858, when the Anglo-French Allied Forces invaded China, the United States took the opportunity to force the Manchu government to sign the "Sino-American Treaty of Tianjin." Ding Weiliang and William both ministers who had lived in China for a long time, accompanied the American Minister Li Weilian (William Reed) to Tianjin to participate in drafting the treaty. In the dispute between the two sides over the preaching clauses at that time, the American side insisted on not giving in, and the two of them also participated in the conspiracy. Later, Ding Weiliang said, "The article on preaching and evangelism was first derived from the American treaty, and the British treaty imitated it" ("Sixty Years of Memories"). This means that American imperialism used missionaries to pave the way for its invasion of China, and other countries such as Britain and France also copied this pattern. By 1900, when the Yihetuan anti-imperialist patriotic movement broke out, various imperialists organized the Eight-Power Allied Forces to suppress it. Ding Weiliang submitted a memorandum to the diplomatic corps in Beijing, advocating that the Manchu government should be jointly managed by various countries. In the late Qing Dynasty, there was Li Timothy, who became an important figure in Chinese political circles with the identity of a religious educator. He ran a newspaper in China, the "Shibao," and a school, "Shanxi University." He claimed to be a friend of China. But he advocated the "Indianization of China" and suggested that foreigners could be used as cabinet ministers in the Chinese government (see his autobiography "Xiduo"). All the above people are so-called "treating others as oneself" and "serving God" among Western missionaries. Overall, in every important stage of China's political and diplomatic affairs in the past, missionaries participated in it, not only as behind-the-scenes activities, but also as protagonists on stage.

　　Third, these imperialist missionaries also universally and directly interfered in China's internal affairs, such as "In the sixth year of Tongzhi (1867), the French Bishop Hong moved the officials of Sichuan Province to cast and use official seals. In the seventh year of Tongzhi, Bishop Hu Fuli of Guizhou arbitrarily sent a note recommending former Daoyuan Duo Wen, etc., requesting that they be given preferential awards. Missionaries in Shandong arbitrarily called themselves governors. Missionaries in Sichuan and Guizhou even suggested the removal of local officials due to missionary cases. This is not only infringing on the power of officials, but even infringing on the power of the country. All kinds of unreasonable circumstances, how can it not arouse public anger" ("Regulations on Missionary Affairs"). As a priest, he actually wanted to "cast and use official seals," "call himself a governor," and even "recommend Daoyuan" and "remove local officials." This shows that these imperialist missionaries were full of ruling desires.

　　Fourth, the other illegal activities and special agent activities of imperialist churches and missionaries in China. Such as sheltering corrupt officials ("Complete Records" Tongzhi "Resident Minister in Tibet Enlin's memorial: Huang Kai seeks protection from French missionaries"), concealing thieves ("Historical Materials on Sino-French Negotiations in the Qing Guangxu Dynasty" Volume 1). Before the Sino-French War in 1884, French churches in Guangxi openly colluded with bandits to carry out their special agent activities on a large scale (Xu Yanxu, Governor of Guangxi's memorial on January 23: "Churches Colluding with Bandits to Cause Trouble"), and later, there were rumors in Dinghai, Zhejiang that there were "ambushes and cannons hidden" in the church (Xue Fucheng "Zhedong Preparation Record" Volume 1). It can be seen that these churches and some of the missionaries in them are in collusion with imperialist aggression, carrying out special agent work in the interior. There were also some missionaries who oppressed the good people. According to the typical example pointed out by the Manchu government, "The case of the beating to death of missionary Li Guoyi in April of the eighth year of Tongzhi was actually caused by church members forcing people to withdraw from marriage, and the commoner He Cai has been executed. However, the church members who killed civilians, and the church member Wang Xueding, who has long been notorious for fraud, extortion, rape, kidnapping, arson, and murder, have not been brought to justice despite being convicted. The priest Tan Fuchen, who gathered crowds to kill more than two hundred Tuansmen including Zhao Yonglin, was said by the missionaries Mei to have gone abroad and could not be investigated. The people of Sichuan were even more resentful" ("Regulations on Missionary Affairs"). A Western missionary actually slaughtered more than two hundred Chinese people, and finally left. Of course, this would arouse the Chinese people to rise up and resolutely resist.

  III. The Resistance of the Chinese People and the So-Called "Missionary Cases"

　　The vast majority of the Chinese people have realized that imperialism is using the church as a front for its aggression, and Western missionaries are the vanguards of the invaders. Therefore, people everywhere universally opposed imperialism and the churches it ran in China. In 1869 (the eighth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty), young students from all over rose up to hold patriotic movements against imperialism (Shen Baozhen "Shen Wensu Gong Zhengshu" Volume 1, "Complete Records" Tongzhi 70). In particular, the people of Sichuan, angered by the missionary Tan Fuchen's slaughter of more than two hundred lives, took even more drastic actions. Yu Dongchen was a representative figure at the time. The Manchu traitorous government and the foreign churches called him a "hero who caused trouble" ("Catalog of Diplomatic Notes of Various Countries in the Late Qing Dynasty" France 332, Shanghai Xujiahui Catholic Church "Ge Zhi Yi Wen Hui Bao" Guangxu 24, No. 30). At that time, the most common action of the people of the whole country was to "destroy churches and kill missionaries" (see Li Gangyi "Records of Missionary Affairs," Xu Jiagan "Collection of Missionary Affairs," etc.). The Manchu official books collectively referred to it as "missionary cases." The largest one was the "Tianjin Missionary Case" in 1870 (the ninth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty). The cause was that the French Ren Ci Tang abducted men and women and buried young children, arousing public outrage and demanding to enter the church for inspection. The French Consul Feng Daye "brought his followers, each holding guns and knives, to the business office to make trouble, and opened fire in the business office towards the minister (Chonghou). The people were all unfair and gathered more and more. Liu Jie rushed to suppress the crowd. When Consul Feng Daye walked out of the business office, he caught sight of Liu Jie and fired at him. Liu Jie dodged, injuring his family member Gao Sheng. The crowd was furious and beat Feng Daye to death. ... The church caught fire on all sides, and the crowd gradually dispersed" ("Complete Records" Tongzhi 77, Tianjin Prefect Zhang Guangzao, Tianjin County Magistrate Liu Jie). This anti-imperialist struggle was purely a mass movement. "Not only was there no instigator, but it was also impossible to determine who started the violence and who first beat the gongs" (Criminal Department's memorial on September 11th of the ninth year of Tongzhi). However, the executioner Zeng Guofan (the Manchu government specially transferred him from Nanjing to Tianjin to handle this case) executed the innocent people "Feng Cripple and other fifteen people were sentenced to death, and Wang Wu and other twenty-one people were sentenced to military exile" in order to please the imperialists. Later, he added "Five people including Liu Er were executed, and four people including Deng Lao were exiled" (General Administration of Foreign Affairs' note to French Minister Luo Shuya on September of the ninth year of Tongzhi). These dozens of people were all killed by the Manchu government for opposing imperialism. At that time, this case aroused criticism from all sides: "Feng Daye, as a French envoy, how could he open fire rashly, bullying the host, and firing again if he missed the first shot? Feng Daye should have died for his crime, and the people's crime was in killing the criminals without authorization, but they were driven by temporary loyalty and indignation and should be given some reduction in punishment. ... There has never been a case of the people attacking robbers and killing their own people. ... But it is rumored that the minister and others' memorial report is not entirely true, and they inevitably favor the French and excessively criticize the people of Tianjin" (Wang Jiabi, Vice Minister of the Taichang Temple, memorial on October 16th of the ninth year of Tongzhi). This was still the official discussion and criticism, and the anger of the people was even more unstoppable. Under the pressure of public opinion from the people of the whole country, Zeng Guofan had no choice but to admit: "I am ashamed of public opinion and blame myself to the gods" (Zeng Guofan's letters). The Manchu government finally "slaughtered the righteous people to apologize to the enemy and secretly gave generous pensions to their families (in fact, there was no 'generous pension' at all—author's note)" (Yixuan's memorial on October 23rd of the ninth year of Tongzhi). The Tianjin Missionary Case was resolved in this way. The Manchu traitorous government succumbed to the power of imperialism and did not hesitate to slaughter patriotic people. This exactly illustrates the essence of general "missionary cases" and the way the traitorous government handled "missionary cases." At that time, even the Manchu government believed that the tyranny of imperialism in China was "now that those who come to China to preach are like countless independent enemy countries within a country, and the resentment of the people is deeper. The people are so many that they cannot be killed, and since public anger has been formed, they will not be willing to bow their heads to be killed" (to various countries in the tenth year of Tongzhi "Summary of Missionary Affairs"). After the Tianjin Missionary Case, many anti-imperialist books and serial pictures were used to publicize to the society, all of which were prohibited by the feudal rulers ("Catalog of Diplomatic Notes" France 303, England 614, 620).

　　The "Tianjin Missionary Case" was in 1870, and the later development of the Yihetuan patriotic movement was in 1900. Although there was a gap of 30 years in between, these two largest people's anti-imperialist movements were closely related in terms of cause and effect. After the "Tianjin Missionary Case" was suppressed, the Manchu ruling class also knew that "the arrogance of the church is becoming more and more rampant, the resentment of our people is accumulating, and the disaster does not know where it will end" (Yixuan et al.'s memorial in July of the tenth year of Tongzhi). Later historians also recognized this point, saying that "in this battle (referring to the Tianjin Missionary Case), France emphasized emotion and underestimated the law, and commentators blamed it. And those who were more concerned with the Tianjin area were even more angry. This is another major reason why the Yihetuan arose" ("Movement History"). Because the "Tianjin Missionary Case" gave the people a profound stimulus, the anti-imperialist and anti-foreign missionary sentiments became even more unstoppable. In the process of these thirty years of development, countless large and small "missionary cases" continued to occur until they finally developed into the Yihetuan Uprising. This uprising was purely a patriotic movement of peasants. Before this, they only opposed imperialist missionaries, but this time they shouted the slogan "eliminate foreigners." From the past of sporadic development in various places to this time reaching the royal capital Beijing, from the past without faith organization to this time with the inherent religious color of peasants in the feudal era.

　　The Yihetuan's patriotic movement was called for "killing foreigners and eliminating corrupt officials." At that time, people called them "righteous people." They showed great courage in the anti-aggression struggle. Even the Manchu government said that "our righteous people use their flesh and blood to fight against guns and cannons, without using a single soldier of the country or spending a single grain of the country. Even young children hold weapons to defend the country" (Edict of the fifth month of the 26th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty). The commander of the Allied Forces in Tianjin, British Admiral Seymour, said that "if the Yihetuan used Western-style guns and cannons, the Allied Forces led by them would be completely wiped out" ("Movement History"). The imperialist "foreign soldiers" attacked the Yihetuan between Langfang and Yangcun, and slaughtered the rebel masses in Beijing, totaling about 40,000 people (Li Zhang "Records of the Boxer Disaster"). In 1901 (the 27th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), the Yihetuan was defeated and the "Xin Chou Treaty" was signed. At that time, the reason why there was only a large amount of compensation (450 million taels of customs silver) and no cession of land was that various imperialists were afraid of the Yihetuan's death struggle. Therefore, they concentrated on economic exploitation and avoided formal stimulation (Guangxuehui Publication "Wanguo Gongbao" in the first month of Xin Chou). From then on, the Manchu government changed from being xenophobic to being pro-foreign, imperialists intensified their aggression against China, and the influence of the church became more widespread and deep-rooted. Church schools, hospitals, etc., disguised as cultural and charitable undertakings, were erected everywhere.

  IV. Conclusion

　　We see that the process of the development of Catholic and Christian churches in China has always followed the track of imperialist development in China. In the history of the past century, the church has been the front station of the invaders, and the invaders have been the background of the church. Whenever there is a foreign affairs event in China, there are some foreign religious figures involved in it, acting as important behind-the-scenes activities. For example, Stuart Lei Deng of the former Yenching University disguised himself as a religious educator in China for many years, pretending to be very sympathetic to China on the surface, but in fact, he was one of the most important agents of the United States in invading China. He was the culmination of Parker, Ding Weiliang, Li Timothy, etc. In the end, he simply took off his mask and revealed his true face, serving as the US ambassador to China and carrying out the task of invading China. Also, the three American spies Bu Xiangxian, etc., who were recently arrested in Tianjin, were all foreign missionaries, and had served as "deans," "priests," and university "vice-presidents" (see this newspaper, April 6th). However, what they did in China was to firmly oppose the Chinese people and willingly serve as agents of imperialism. These are all typical examples of the relationship between imperialism and missionaries, which deserves our vigilance.

　　Therefore, the religious policy of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government is very clear, that is: the people have the freedom to believe in religion (Article 5 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), but pure religious beliefs should be absolutely separated from foreign aggressive activities and counter-revolutionary activities and should not be mixed with them. Regarding this point, all patriotic people of Catholicism and Christianity are aware of this today. The conscious patriotic movement held by Catholics and Christians across the country is welcomed and supported by the vast majority of the people.

　　帝国主义怎样利用宗教侵略中国
    谢兴尧
    去年（一九五○年）九月二十二日中国基督教界发表《中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径》宣言后，数月以来，全国各地的教徒，广泛地发起了爱国运动，宣布与帝国主义脱离关系，实行“自治、自养、自传”。这种自立革新运动，是中国基督教徒一种新的光明道路。但是教会中某些帝国主义分子则是仇视这一运动的，如最近天主教中所发现的秘密文件“学习参考”（原文见三月十三日光明日报），它竟不承认曾经与帝国主义发生过联系，说什么“自无所谓斩断联系”，并主张“应当在神长领导之下实现三自原则”。这种破坏天主教自立革新爱国运动的企图，已引起各方面的注视和愤慨。天主教的教友们，如津沽大学教授张羽时所写的“和天主教教友们谈怎样爱教”（见三月三十日光明日报）及辅仁大学陈垣校长所写的“对辅仁大学的天主教徒讲话”（见三月十七日本报）以及最近天津天主教革新委员会成立会上，吴光齐、聂国屏等的报告（见四月九日本报）等，都是针对着帝国主义分子破坏天主教的罪证而发出的正义的吼声。实际上，谁都不能忘记帝国主义怎样利用天主教和基督教来侵略中国，并在我国历史上留下了血泪斑斑的事迹。
  一、帝国主义利用教会作为侵略工具的开端
    天主教自明朝万历十年（一五八二年）即已输入中国，但当时并未得到发展。到清朝初叶和中叶，满清政府为防止教会在中国的非法活动，不许西洋人在中国传教。一八四二年（清道光二十二年）因鸦片战争，中国战败，在炮口的威吓之下订立了《南京条约》，于是大批帝国主义的爪牙——外国教士，纷纷来华，他们认为这是一个“转机”，“好像一朝重睹天日”（见德礼贤“中国天主教传教史”）。在一八四四年，美国胁迫满清政府成立《望厦条约》，其中首先规定美国人可在中国通商口岸设立医院、教堂。接着法国又强迫满清政府在《黄浦条约》中承认对法国教堂要加以保护。及至一八五八年（清咸丰八年）在英法联军之役中，“中法天津条约”成立，又规定“凡中国人愿信崇天主教而循规蹈矩者，毫无查禁，皆免惩治。向来所有或写或刻奉禁天主教各明文，无论何处，概行宽免”。从此帝国主义在中国传教，得到了条约上的保障，各地方的教会便很快恢复，于是侵略者的棋子遂满布于我国各地。帝国主义者就是这样地用大炮把传教士送到了中国。
    这些外国教会经过一百多年的禁止（清康熙、雍正、乾隆、嘉庆四朝）之后，又来了这一个所谓“转机”，他们便趾高气扬，制造所谓“给还旧址交涉”。《南京条约》订立后，满清政府被迫承认，“所有康熙年间各省旧建之天主堂，除改为庙宇民居者毋庸查办外，其原旧房屋，如勘明确实，准其给还该处奉教之人”（道光二十六年正月二十五日上谕）。至一八六○年（清咸丰十年）英法联军之后，又强迫订立“天津续约”，更扩大了“发还旧址”的范围，规定凡“前奉天主教者之天主堂、学堂、坟茔、田地、房廊等件，应赔还交该处奉教之人”（续约第六款），这就引起了我国人民与教士的争执。
    自一八四六年（道光二十六年）以后，“还堂交涉”是当时最繁难最严重的问题，原因是教士们借口“发还旧址命令”作种种无理要求。如“各省地方，抵还教堂，不管是否有碍民情，硬要给还。并有强指绅士华丽房屋为昔年教堂，逼令民间退让之事，甚至将有碍体制之地，及公所会馆庙宇，为阖地绅民所最尊崇者，均任意索取抵给教堂。即或实系当年教堂经教中人卖出，嗣后民间转相售卖，已非一主，并有从新修理费用甚巨者，教士不出价值，逼令交还。又因房屋偶有倾倒，反索修理之费。各种举动，百姓均怒目相视，俨若仇敌。”（见总理衙门给各国“议办传教章程”以下简称“传教章程”）这是满清卖国政府说的，实际还不止此。我们若翻阅一下当时有关还堂的文献，如“筹办夷务始末”，“清季各国照会目录”，及李鸿章、刘蓉等的奏议，其中关于还堂的交涉文件，还多得很。时间则仅由一八五六至一八六八年，区域则遍于南北各地，而这些交涉，均系帝国主义传教士依据侵略条约及满清政府所颁布的“给还旧址”命令提出要求的。
    《南京条约》是帝国主义侵略中国的开始，外国教士在中国大肆活动也是从此开始的。
  二、外国教士擅入内地及干涉中国内政的暴行
    帝国主义既利用教会为侵略中国的据点，有些外国教士遂以政治条约为背景，以金钱为工具，侵害中国主权，欺压中国人民。
    第一是西洋教士擅入内地。《南京条约》用《中美望厦条约》虽然规定外人只能在通商口岸居住，不得入中国内地传教通商。而帝国主义者则常故意违约，擅自潜入内地。他们因被各省地方官查拿而引起的交涉，由一八四六至一八五○年五年之间即发生三十五件之多（“筹办夷务始末”道光，以下简称“筹末”）。发生的地方有：西藏、四川、湖北、浙江、广东、河北、山西、江苏等地。在这短时期内，外国教士们到处潜入我内地和边区。一八五○年（清道光三十年）美国教士丁韪良来到中国，他明知道“按条约，终不许入内地”传教，但是他悍然地说：“吾人奉主命传教万方，即有世俗阻止，安能阻哉”（丁韪良“花甲忆记”）。当时由于满清政府腐朽无能，对于西洋教士、外国使臣的蛮横要挟，根本无法应付，不敢阻止。
    第二是教士们以“中国通”的资格，作各帝国主义侵略中国的谋主。每次签订不平等条约，他们大都参与其事，阴谋策划。大家都知道“南京条约”是中国第一次带上帝国主义的枷锁，马利逊牧师是基督教徒来中国的第一人，但是这不平等条约（南京条约）的起草人，便是这位新教徒马利逊牧师。而中文草稿又出自名教士郭实那（Rev Gutelaff）之手，中国方面只在字句上略加修饰。这个条约便由这两位教士包办。马利逊在一八四三年七月十六日写信给他的妻子，很自得地说：“我要告诉你，我的名义是中文秘书兼译员，年薪一千三百镑，我应当穿副领事的制服，上有皇家的钮扣”（见《马利逊小传》）。一八四四年美国派遣顾兴（Caleb Cushing）来中国强迫满清政府签订“望厦条约”，协助顾兴订约的主要人员，便是美国最早来中国的基督教士裨治文和伯驾两牧师，他们替帝国主义弄得了五口通商权，治外法权，传教权和置买地产权。裨治文牧师在他家信中说：“我等在中国传教之人，与其说是由于宗教之原因，毋宁说是由于政治之原因”，这是他的坦白招供。而伯驾牧师也曾亲自回到华盛顿，向美国参众议员做侵略中国的报告（广学会出版：《梁发》）。他竟因侵华有功，于一八五五年九月便正式就任驻华使节，负起侵华的总责。一八六○年满清政府与法国增订条约（即中法北京和约）时，有法教士随法使为翻译，于中文中竟私自添入“准法国宣教师在各省租买田地，建造自便”（陈捷“义和团运动史”以下简称“运动史”）一句，昏瞆的满清政府，竟签字承认。一八五八年英法联军侵略中国，美国利用机会强迫满清政府签订“中美天津条约”，久住中国的丁韪良和威廉士两牧师，即随美公使利卫廉（WilliamReed）到天津，参加起草条约的工作。在当时双方对于传教条文的争执中，美方坚持不让，他二人也参与其谋。后来丁韪良说“奉教传道一节，系先出于美约、英约仿照也”（“花甲忆记”）。这就是说美帝国主义利用传教士为它开辟了侵略中国的道路，同时英法等国也是照着这个图样加以翻版。及至一九○○年义和团反帝爱国运动爆发，各帝国主义组织八国联军前来镇压，丁韪良又上条陈于北京公使团，他主张由各国共同管理满清政府。在清末又有以宗教家教育家的身份成为中国政界要人的李提摩太，他在中国办过报——《时报》，办过学校——“山西大学”，他自称是中国的朋友。但他主张“中国印度化”，又提议中国政府内阁部长可以用外国人（见他的自传《西铎》）。以上这些人都是西洋教士中所谓“待人如己”“为上帝服务的”。总观过去凡中国政治上、外交上每一重要阶段，均有传教士参与其间，不只是作幕后活动，并且还作台上主角。
    第三是这些帝国主义传教士还普遍地直接干涉中国内政，如“同治六年（一八六七年）法国洪主教移行四川省官员，铸用关防开用。同治七年贵州主教胡缚理擅送照会一件，保举前道员多文等，请予优奖。山东传教士有擅称巡抚之事。四川贵州教士并有因教案致请撤地方官之说。是不但侵官吏之权，甚且侵国家之权，种种无理情事，焉得不激成众怒”（“传教章程”）。以一个教士的身份，而要“铸用关防”，“自称巡抚”，并且还要“保举道员”，“撤换地方官”，这都说明这些帝国主义传教士是充满了统治欲望的。
    第四是帝国主义在中国的教堂和教士的其他不法行为和特务活动。如庇护贪官（“筹末”同治“驻藏大臣恩麟奏黄铠投法教士为护符”折），隐匿盗首（“清光绪朝中法交涉史料”卷一），一八八四年后中法战事发生以前，广西的法国教堂公然勾引匪徒大肆其特务活动（一月二十三日广西巡抚徐延旭奏“教堂勾匪滋事折”），后来浙江定海又风闻教堂内有“伏奸藏炮”的事（薛福成“浙东筹防录”卷一）。可见这些教堂和其中的一部分教士实与帝国主义的侵略相表里，在内地作特务工作。还有一些教士欺压善良。据满清政府所指为典型的，如“同治八年四月殴毙教士李国一案，实因教民逼人退婚而起，已将平民何彩正法。而教民杀死平民，及历年诈搕奸掳焚杀夙称首恶之教民王学鼎等，虽经议罪，迄未到案。其纠众杀毙团民赵永林等二百余命之司铎覃辅臣，梅教士声称已赴外洋，无从究办，川民更为忿恨”（“传教章程”）。以一个西洋教士竟屠杀中国人民二百余人之多，末了一走了事，当然要激起中国人民起来坚决进行反抗了。
  三、中国人民的反抗和所谓“教案”
    中国广大的人民已经认识帝国主义利用教会作他侵略的前哨，西洋教士更是侵略者的先锋，因此各地人民普遍地反对帝国主义及其在华所办的教会。一八六九年（清同治八年）各地青年学生起来举行反对帝国主义的爱国运动（沈葆桢“沈文肃公政书”卷一、“筹末”同治七十）。特别四川人民因愤于教士覃辅臣屠杀了二百余条人命，行动更为激烈，如余栋臣便是当时的代表人物。满清卖国政府和外国教会称他是“闹教英雄”（“清季各国照会目录”法三三二页以下简称“照会目录”，上海徐家汇天主堂“格致益闻汇报”光绪二十四年三十号）。当时全国各地人民群众最普遍的行动，是“毁教堂，杀教士”（见李刚已“教务纪略”，徐家干“教务辑要”等），满清官书统称之为“教案”。最大的一次是一八七○年（清同治九年）的“天津教案”，其起因是当时法国仁慈堂迷拐男女，埋葬幼孩，引起人民激愤，要求进入教堂检查。法国领事官丰大业“随带跟丁，各持枪刀，同赴通商衙门滋闹，在商署向该大臣（崇厚）开放洋枪，百姓均为不平，愈聚愈众。刘杰赶到向众民弹压，适该领事丰大业由商署走出，瞥见刘杰，即对面施放洋枪，刘杰躲避，致将家人高升中伤。众人忿激，将丰大业群殴毙命。………教堂四方火起，众始逐渐解散”（“筹末”同治七七天津知府张光藻天津知县刘杰语）。这一次反帝斗争，纯粹是一个群众运动，“非特无主使，其何人动手逞凶，及何人首先鸣锣，亦不能确凿指出”（同治九年九月十一日刑部奏）。但刽子手曾国藩（满清政府特把他由南京调到天津办理此案）为了讨好帝国主义，竟把无辜人民“冯瘸子等十五名拟以正法，王五等二十一名拟以军徒”。后来又补添“将刘二等五名正法，邓老等四名发配”（同治九年十月总理衙门给法国使臣罗淑亚照会）。以上这几十个人都是因反对帝国主义而被满清政府杀害的。当时此案引起各方批评：“丰大业以法国使臣，何得遽开洋枪，强宾欺主，一击不中，又击其次。是丰大业本有应死之罪，而百姓罪在擅杀罪人，然出于一时忠义奋发，当得稍从末减，………未有国人攻盗，而骈戮国人者也。………乃传闻该大臣等奏办情节多有未符，不免于法国曲徇出脱，于津民过涉吹求”（同治九年十月十六日太常寺少卿王家璧奏）。这还是官方的议论批评，人民的愤怒更是不可遏止的。在全国人民的舆论压迫下，曾国藩也只好承认：“外惭清议，内咎神明”（曾国藩书札），而满清政府终于“杀戮义民以谢敌，又暗为厚恤（其实毫无‘厚恤’可言——作者注）其家”（同治九年闰十月二十三日奕譞奏），天津教案便是如此解决的。满清卖国政府既屈服于帝国主义的势力，且不惜杀戮爱国的人民。这正说明一般“教案”的本质，和卖国政府处理“教案”的方法。当时帝国主义在中国的横暴，即满清政府也认为“现在来中国传教者，直如一国之中有无数自专自主之敌国、平民怨毒更深，而百姓至众，不可尽诛，况众怒已成，将有不肯俯首就诛之势”（同治十年给各国“议办传教节略”）。天津教案之后，当时民间有许多反帝的书籍和连环图画向社会宣传，均被封建统治者禁止（“照会目录”法三○三页，英六一四、六二○页）。
    “天津教案”是一八七○年，后来发展为义和团爱国运动是一九○○年，中间虽距三十年之久，但这两次最大的人民反帝运动，实有密切的因果关系。当“天津教案”被镇压后，满清统治阶级也知道“教中之气焰愈张，吾民之怨愤愈积，祸患正不知所止”（同治十年七月奕诉等奏）。后来论史者也认识此点，说“是役也（按指天津教案）法重情轻，论者冤之。而天津附近地方见闻较切者，尤愤激焉，此又义和团所以兴起之大原因也”（“运动史”）。因为当时“天津教案”给人民深刻的刺激，反帝及反对外国教士的情绪，更不可遏止。在这三十年发展过程中，又继续不断的发生了无数次大大小小的“教案”，直到最后发展为义和团起义。这次起义是纯粹农民的爱国主义运动。前此只是反对帝国主义传教士，这次则喊出“灭洋”的口号，从前只是在各地零星发展，这次并到达封建统治的王都北京城，从前没有信仰组织，这次则带着封建时代农民固有的宗教色彩。
    义和团的爱国运动，是以“杀洋人、灭赃官”为号召的，当时人们均称之为“义民”，在反侵略斗争中，曾表现了伟大勇敢的精神。即满清政府也说“我义民以血肉之躯，与枪炮相薄，不用国家一兵，不麋国家一饷，甚至髫龄童子亦执干戈以卫社稷”（清光绪二十六年五月上谕）。天津方面的联军统帅英国海军提督西摩尔说“义和团所用若为西式枪炮，则所率联军必全军覆没”（“运动史”）。帝国主义的“洋兵”在廊房杨村间攻击义和团，并在北京屠杀起义群众，共约四万人（李杖“拳祸记”）。一九○一年（清光绪二十七年）义和团战败，订立“辛丑和约”，当时只大量赔款（海关银四百五十兆两）而未割地者，即因各帝国主义怵于义和团的死战，故集中于经济上的压榨，避免形式上的刺激（辛丑正月广学会出版《万国公报》）。从此满清政府一变仇外而为媚外，帝国主义者对中国更加紧侵略，教会势力也更为普遍深入。披着文化与慈善事业外衣的教会学校、医院等，到处林立。
  四、结语
    我们看天主教、基督教教会在中国发展的过程，始终是沿着帝国主义在中国发展的轨道，在近百年史上，教会是侵略者的前站，侵略者又是教会的背景，中国一有对外交涉事件，即有若干外国的宗教家掺杂其间，作重要的幕后活动。如前燕京大学的司徒雷登在中国伪装宗教家教育家多少年，表面上作出非常同情中国的样子，实际上他是美国侵略中国一个最重要的特务，是集过去的伯驾、丁韪良、李提摩太等之大成。后来索性揭开假面具露出他的本来面目，作美国驻华大使，执行侵略中国的任务。又最近在天津逮捕的三个美国间谍卜相贤等，他们也均是外国教士，还曾作过《院长》、《神甫》、及大学《副校长》等（见四月六日本报）。然而他们在中国所作的事，是坚决地反对中国人民，甘愿作帝国主义的特务。这都是帝国主义与教士关系的典型例证，值得我们警惕的。
    所以中国共产党和中央人民政府的宗教政策规定得很明确，就是：人民有信仰宗教的自由（人民政协共同纲领第五条），但是纯粹的宗教信仰，应当绝对与外国侵略活动以及反革命活动相分离而不应当与它们混合起来。关于这一点，凡是天主教与基督教的爱国人士，在今天都有此觉悟。现在全国各地的天主教、基督教教徒所举行的自觉的爱国运动，是绝大多数人民所欢迎与支持的。
