    CPC Anci County Committee Accepts Criticism; Significant Improvement in Cadre Cultural Studies

To the Editor:

    After reading the reader's criticism in the People's Daily on January 31 regarding our neglect of cultural studies, the CPC Anci County Committee immediately convened a cadre meeting. Each member of the County Committee made a self-criticism in public. We also reorganized our studies, launching a challenge competition for cultural learning among various departments, which has yielded great results. The number of students increased from 130 to 196, accounting for 52 percent of the total enrollment. By April 1st, all members of the County Committee had enrolled. We are now reporting our self-criticism and improvement measures as follows:

    The main reasons why we failed to adhere to the study system in the past are threefold: First, the style of working as a mere functionary was severe. We personally handled issues that should not have been personally handled, immersing ourselves in routine tasks every day and squeezing out study time. Second, there were too many meetings, taking up one-third of each month. Being busy with meetings, we neglected our studies. Third, we lacked the spirit to overcome difficulties. If courses were delayed too much, it was hard to catch up, especially in arithmetic. We thought that going would only result in confusion, so it was better to study at home, and thus we became sluggish.

    Therefore, cadre studies resulted in County Committee members skipping more classes than regular staff and section chiefs; the County Party Secretary and County Magistrate skipped even more, with some not studying at all. Even the responsible political education teacher could not give lectures on time. In the future, in addition to emphasizing the importance of learning ideologically, we must adhere to the two-hour morning study system; we will also establish a regular work system and uniformly allocate time for meetings to ensure study time.

### 中共安次县委会接受批评  干部文化学习已有显著改进

    中共安次县委会接受批评
    干部文化学习已有显著改进编辑同志：
    读了一月三十一日人民日报上读者对我们忽视文化学习的批评后，中共安次县委会即召开了干部大会。每个县委委员都当众作了检讨。并重新整顿了学习，掀起了各部门间文化学习的挑战竞赛，收到了很大的效果。学员由一百三十名增到一百九十六名，占入学总人数的百分之五十二，到四月一日，县委委员已全部入学。现将我们的检讨与改进办法报告如下：
    过去我们不能坚持学习制度的主要原因有三：第一是事务主义作风严重，不应亲自处理的问题也亲自去处理，天天陷在事务工作的圈子里，把学习时间也挤掉了。第二是会议多，每个月有三分之一时间都被会议占去了；忙于会议，就放松了学习。第三是克服困难精神不够。课程耽误太多就赶不上去，特别是算术，认为去了听个稀里糊涂，不如在家里看看，这样就疲蹋下来了。
    因此，干部学习形成了县委委员比干事、科股长旷课多；县委书记、县长则旷课更多，甚至有根本不学习的现象，负责的政治课也不能按时去讲。今后除从思想上重视学习外，必须坚持早晨两点钟的学习制度；并将通过树立正规的工作制度，统一分配会议时间，以保证学习时间。
