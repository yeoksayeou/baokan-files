　　Xinhua News Agency, Eighth Dispatch: Tianjin News: More than 6,000 employees and family members of the Tianjin Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration held a conference on March 31 at the Ningyuan playground of the Bureau to accuse the counter-revolutionary element Mo Liting of sabotaging 62 locomotives and persecuting four workers to death. The Tianjin Military Control Commission's Military Law Office accepted the workers' just demands and, in accordance with the Regulations on Punishing Counter-revolutionaries, executed Mo on the spot by shooting. Before liberation, Mo Liting served as the deputy section chief of the Qinhuangdao Railway Locomotive Section of the Kuomintang and the deputy leader of the anti-espionage team of the Qinhuangdao Port Command, consistently treating workers harshly and cruelly, persecuting workers such as Wang Xi, Wang Zhongyu, and Xiao Dianfeng to death. On November 26, 1948, when the People's Liberation Army was about to enter Qinhuangdao, the bandit Mo Liting colluded with bandit troops to threaten workers with guns and sabotage 62 complete locomotives. After liberation, the bandit Mo infiltrated the inspection office of our Tianjin Railway Bureau, continuing to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. He was arrested in February of this year after being reported by employees.
    The accusation meeting began at 2:00 PM. Employees and family members who had been persecuted by the bandit Mo, such as Chen Yuhua, Cui Hualin, Cao Shizong, Kang Liangcheng, and Fu Zhensheng, took to the stage to accuse him one after another. Chen Yuhua, a family member of a victim, accused Mo Liting, a special agent, of forcing her husband, Kou Chengjie, to death. She spoke through tears, and fainted twice during her speech. Kou Chengjie worked as a foreman riveter on the Qinhuangdao Railway. Because he did not give gifts to Mo Liting on his birthday or during the New Year, the bandit Mo harbored a grudge against him, forcing him to do the work of four people. Kou Chengjie died of a serious illness due to overwork.
    Cui Hualin, a worker who came from Qinhuangdao to attend the meeting, accused Mo Liting of colluding with bandit troops to threaten workers and sabotage 62 locomotives, which aroused great anger among the attendees. Everyone unanimously demanded that the bandit Mo be executed immediately. The trial judge of the Military Law Office of the Tianjin Military Control Commission represented the government in accepting the just demands of the employees present, announced the crimes of the counter-revolutionary element Mo Liting on the spot, sentenced him to death, and executed him by shooting on the spot.

　　天津铁路职工和家属集会控诉特务罪行
　  么匪立亭当场被处死刑
    【新华社八日讯】天津消息：天津铁路管理局天津分局职工和家属六千余人，于三月三十一日在该局宁园操场举行控诉破坏六十二台机车、迫死四个工人的反革命分子么立亭大会。天津市军事管制委员会军法处接受职工的正义要求，依据惩治反革命条例，当场将么犯执行枪决。么立亭在解放前曾任国民党秦皇岛铁路机务段副段长兼匪秦皇岛港口司令部防谍组副组长，对工人一贯苛刻虐待，曾将工人王喜、王忠玉、萧殿风等迫害致死。一九四八年十一月二十六日解放军快进入秦皇岛时，么匪立亭勾结匪军持枪威胁工人，破坏了六十二台完整的机车。解放后么匪混入我天津铁路局检察室工作，继续进行反革命活动，今年二月经职工检举后逮捕。
    控诉会于下午二时开始，曾被么匪迫害过的职工及家属陈玉华、崔华林、曹世宗、康良成、傅振声等相继登台控诉。被害人家属陈玉华控诉她丈夫寇成杰被特务么立亭逼死的经过时，一句一泪，中间晕倒两次。寇成杰在秦皇岛铁路上作铆工领班，在么立亭寿辰和过年过节时没有送礼，因此被么匪怀恨在心，强迫他一个人干四个人的活，寇成杰因过度劳累而重病致死。
    从秦皇岛赶来参加大会的工人崔华林控诉了么立亭勾结匪军威胁工人破坏六十二台机车的经过情形，引起了到会群众的万分愤怒。大家一致要求将么匪立即枪决。天津军事管制委员会军法处审判员代表政府接受到会职工的正义要求，当场宣布反革命分子么立亭的罪状，判处死刑，就地执行枪决。
