　　Welcoming "May Day," Launching a Labor Emulation Drive
　　Workers in Northeast China and Beijing Improve Production Efficiency
　　Railway Workers and Others Across the Country Actively Prepare to Participate in Large-Scale Demonstrations
    Xinhua News Agency: To welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day, workers in state-owned factories and mines in Northeast China are stepping up production to complete their April production tasks. According to preliminary statistics from the Northeast Industry Department, as of the 25th, 19 of the 37 major products, including coal, coke, calcium carbide, glass, cotton cloth, and blankets, have completed their plans. Among them, seven products exceeded the entire month's plan. The remaining 18 products are also largely close to completion.
    The competition conditions formulated by many factory and mine workshops and groups to welcome "May Day" have also been basically realized or exceeded. The Ma Hengchang group of a machine factory in Northeast China completed the entire month's task eight days ahead of schedule, and the product quality reached 100%. In the production of the Wang Yanlong workshop of a machine factory this month, due to the old machinery, there were failures; however, through the intensive labor of the workers in the workshop and improved operating methods, the entire month's plan was still completed four days ahead of schedule. The Li Shuchun group of a foundry in a factory once proposed to complete "double the task" (i.e., produce twice as much as the prescribed task) at the end of April as a gift to welcome "May Day"; due to the group's efforts to improve quality and reduce defective products, "double the task" was fully completed on the 23rd.

    Beijing workers are stepping up labor emulation to welcome "May Day." The Beijing Railway Station luggage transfer group proposed the condition of 100,000 pieces of luggage and parcels without accidents in the April work plan to challenge the entire station, which was enthusiastically responded to by other groups. Now the group has achieved more than 37,000 pieces without accidents. Loading and unloading workers have proposed the condition of loading and unloading 200,000 pieces of luggage without accidents, and now more than 186,000 pieces have been loaded and unloaded without accidents; the loading and unloading speed has also increased by 30%. The Hongda Weaving Factory in the Fourth District produced an average of 48 bolts of cloth per day in March, and has increased to more than 52 bolts in April. The printing factory of the Political Department of the North China Military Region and the Jinghua Rubber Factory, which are carrying out production competitions, will all use good competitions to welcome "May Day." The Tang Qingsheng group of the newly established pharmaceutical factory in the First District, the Ji'an Flour Mill, and other units have also put forward their own guarantees and efforts. The Beijing Postal District launched a patriotic newspaper and magazine distribution competition on April 20. Beijing post offices originally planned to increase the distribution of various newspapers by 2,000 copies before "May Day." Due to the result of mutual competition, as of April 25, each post office had increased the distribution of newspapers by 2,530 copies.
　　　　　　
    Railway workers across the country are actively preparing for the "May Day" large-scale demonstration. The Tianjin District Federation of Trade Unions of the China Railway Trade Union is organizing various gatherings on the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, mobilizing and organizing marching teams. The Taiyuan District Federation of Trade Unions has instructed its subordinate trade unions at all levels to widely publicize the great political significance of the "May Day" parade and demonstration to the working masses, and decided to mobilize 100% of the employees (except those on duty that day) and 50% of their families to participate in the demonstration. The Zhengzhou District Federation of Trade Unions has established a "May Day" demonstration preparatory committee to uniformly lead the preparations for the "May Day" demonstration. Railway workers in the district are preparing to turn their production achievement charts, patriotic covenants, production competition conditions, and the number of people who signed in support of the conclusion of a peace treaty and opposed the US arming of Japan into signs during the "May Day" parade, so that the demonstration becomes a review of work and a mobilization of competition. The Jinan District Federation of Trade Unions is compiling the marching team, appointing disciplinarians, propagandists, health workers, liaison officers, etc., preparing for the "May Day" large-scale demonstration.
　　　　　　
    Workers in various parts of Central and Southern China are actively preparing to participate in the "May Day" grand parade and demonstration. 100,000 workers in Wuhan will participate in the demonstration. They have now been formed into teams according to the industrial system. Labor models throughout the city will wear medals and red flowers at the forefront of the marching teams. The marching team of porters in the city has been fully organized, and scattered handicraft workers have also organized five large teams. Many family members of workers participating in the parade have been incorporated into the parade teams in each district. The Guangzhou and Zhengzhou Federations of Trade Unions are actively carrying out various preparations in accordance with the "May Day" demonstration plan. Guangzhou is preparing to mobilize more than 100,000 workers to participate in the "May Day" demonstration. The Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Nanchang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have also inspected the preparations of the affiliated trade union organizations for the "May Day" large-scale parade and demonstration. The Zhumadian Municipal Federation of Trade Unions in Henan Province is preparing to mobilize 2,400 workers and 600 family members of workers to participate in the "May Day" large-scale demonstration.

　　迎接“五一”，开展劳动竞赛
　  东北北京工人生产效率提高
　  全国铁路职工等积极准备参加大示威
    东北各国营厂矿职工以加紧生产，完成四月份生产任务，迎接“五一”国际劳动节。据东北工业部初步统计，截至二十五日止，在三十七种主要产品中，已有煤、焦炭、电石、玻璃、棉布、毛毯等十九种产品完成计划。其中并有七种超额完成全月计划。其余十八种产品亦大部接近完成。
    许多厂矿的车间和小组，为迎接“五一”节制订的竞赛条件也已基本实现或超过。东北某机器厂马恒昌小组，提前八天完成全月任务，产品质量达到百分之百。某机器厂王延隆车间在这个月的生产中，由于机器老旧，曾发生故障；但经全车间工人的紧张劳动和改进操作方法，仍使全月计划提前四天完成。某厂翻砂场李树春小组，曾提出在四月底完成“双份任务”（即较规定任务多生产一倍）作为迎接“五一”的献礼；由于该组工人想办法提高质量，少出废品，“双份任务”已于二十三日全部完成。（新华社）
    北京市工人，以加紧劳动竞赛，迎接“五一”。北京车站行李中转小组在四月份工作计划中，提出十万件行李包裹无事故的条件向全站挑战，得到了其他小组的热烈响应。现在该小组已作到三万七千多件无事故。装卸工人提出装卸二十万件行李无事故的条件，现在已装卸十八万六千多件没有发生事故；装卸速度也提高了百分之三十。四区宏大织布厂，三月份每天平均产布四十八匹，四月份已提高到五十二匹以上。正在开展生产竞赛的华北军区政治部印刷厂、京华橡胶厂等，都要以搞好竞赛来迎接“五一”。一区新建制药厂唐青生小组、继安面粉厂等单位，也都纷纷提出自己的保证和努力目标。北京邮区从四月二十日展开爱国主义报刊发行竞赛运动。北京市各邮局原定在“五一”前增发各种报纸两千份，由于互相竞赛的结果，截至四月二十五日，各局已增发报纸两千五百三十份。
