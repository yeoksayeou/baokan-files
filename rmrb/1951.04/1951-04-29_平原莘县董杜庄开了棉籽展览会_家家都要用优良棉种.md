    Cotton Seed Exhibition Held in Dongduzhuang, Xin County, Pingyuan
    Every Household Wants to Use Superior Cotton Seeds
  Editor:
    The farmers of Dongduzhuang, Fifth District, Xin County, Pingyuan Province, held a cotton seed exhibition on Qingming Festival. Out of 128 households in the village, 112 participated in the exhibition. Everyone took turns displaying their cotton seeds, and labor model Zeng Guangfu led the inspection. The result was that 67 households' cotton seeds were not pure "Si" cotton. Zeng Guangfu explained the advantages of "Si" cotton to everyone. He also used specific examples to prove that "Si" cotton has better lint and yields more, which can be exchanged for more millet. Many farmers said: "We used to think that any cotton seed would produce cotton, and we didn't know that 'Si' cotton had such great advantages." After listening to the lecture, many farmers decided to keep the mixed cotton seeds and go to the district to get "Si" cotton seeds to plant.

    平原莘县董杜庄开了棉籽展览会
    家家都要用优良棉种
  编辑同志：
    平原省莘县五区董杜庄的农民，在清明节那天，开了一个棉籽展览会。全村一百二十八户，有一百一十二户参加展览。大家挨次把棉籽摆好，由劳动模范曾广福领头检查了一遍，结果有六十七户的棉籽不是纯斯字棉。曾广福就给大家说明斯字棉的优点，他并用具体的例子向大家证明斯字棉绒好，收的多，可以多换小米。很多农民说：原来咱们以为是棉花籽都会结花，也不知道斯字棉有这大的好处。很多农民们听讲以后，就决定把杂棉籽留下，要到区里领斯字棉回来种。
