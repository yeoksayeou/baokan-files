Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 14th - News: The right-wing majority of the French National Assembly barely passed a bill on the 5th to so-called "reform the electoral system" by a narrow margin of 263 votes to 251, changing the current proportional representation system in France to a majority representation system.

The reason why the French reactionaries want to amend the electoral law is because they are extremely afraid of the growing prestige of the French Communist Party among the people, and fear that they will be defeated in the upcoming elections. Therefore, under the instruction of the United States, they have created an anti-democratic electoral law in an attempt to reduce the seats of the Communist Party, which is supported by more than one-third of French voters, to a minimum, so that they can freely implement the policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war in the future. This conspiracy of the French reactionaries has been brewing for a long time, but has made little progress due to the strong opposition of the people and the uneven distribution of spoils within the various right-wing parties. The previous government of Prime Minister Pleven even fell as a result. Now, given that there are only two months until the general election, they hastily passed this amendment to the electoral law with a majority of only twelve votes.

According to the new electoral law, all right-wing parties in France can form a group, submit a joint list of candidates, and participate in the election. As long as this reactionary party group obtains more than 50% of the votes in any electoral district, it can monopolize all the seats belonging to that electoral district, and then distribute these seats internally. Even if the Communist Party obtains 49% of the votes, it will not get a single seat. The right-wing parties can also ostensibly "refuse" to form a group with the fascist de Gaulle's "French People's Alliance", but in fact collude behind the scenes, using the provisions of the electoral law to allow voters to cross out candidates' names, add de Gaulle elements, or change the order of candidates' names. In this way, the reactionary party group can get both the votes of those who oppose de Gaulle elements and the votes of those who support de Gaulle elements. The election law also stipulates that each province with different populations will elect the same number of deputies. This is particularly unfavorable to the proletariat in the densely populated industrial provinces of central and northern France.

This insidious "reform" of the electoral system by the French reactionary ruling group has been strongly opposed by the people. At the same time as the right-wing parties conspired to amend the electoral law, the French working people have established committees to defend universal suffrage, fighting to defend their right to representation. Under this strong pressure from the people, many members of the National Assembly abstained from voting when voting on this reactionary electoral law, and dared not vote in favor. However, as the Agence Telegraphique Suisse pointed out: "The vote in the National Assembly is only a faint reflection of the tide of anger sweeping the country."

　　美国指使法反动派操纵议会
    通过反民主的选举法
    企图减少法共议席以便放手扩军备战
    【新华社十四日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会的政府右翼多数，已在五日以二百六十三票对二百五十一票的微弱多数，勉强通过了所谓“改革选举制度”的法案，把法国现行比例代表制的选举法改为多数代表制。
    法国反动派之所以要修改选举法，是因为他们极度害怕法国共产党在人民中间的威信日益增长，害怕自己会在即将到来的选举中遭到失败，因此在美国授意下，制造了一个反民主的选举法，企图把得到法国三分之一以上选民拥护的共产党的议席减少到最低限度，以便自己今后可以放手实行扩军备战的政策。法国反动派的这个阴谋已经酝酿了很长的时期，可是一直因为人民的强大反对与各右翼政党内部的分赃不均而没有什么进展，法国上一届的普利文政府甚至竟因此而倒台。现在他们鉴于距大选只有两个月，就匆匆以仅仅十二票的多数，通过了这次修改选举法的法案。
    根据新的选举法，法国的一切右翼政党可以结成一个集团，提出联合候选名单，参加竞选。只要这个反动政党集团在任何一个选区里获得百分之五十以上的选票，它就可以独占属于这个选区的全部议席，然后再把这些议席在内部加以分配。而共产党纵然能获得百分之四十九的选票，也连一个议席都不能得到。各右翼政党又可以在表面上“拒绝”和法西斯分子戴高乐的“法兰西人民联盟”结成集团，而事实上在幕后勾结起来，利用选举法的规定，让选民涂改候选名单，把戴高乐分子添上，或更改候选人姓名的排列次序。这样，反动政党集团就可以既得到反对戴高乐分子的选票，又得到拥护戴高乐分子的选票了。选举法还规定人口不同的各省选出同样数目的议员。这就特别不利于在人口稠密的中部及北部各工业省份的无产阶级。
    法国反动统治集团这种居心叵测的选举制“改革”，受到人民的强烈反对。和右翼各政党阴谋活动修改选举法同时，法国劳动人民纷纷成立了保卫普选委员会，为保卫他们的代表权而斗争。在人民这种强大的压力下，国民议会在表决这个反动的选举法时，许多议员弃权，而不敢投赞成票。但是，正如电通社指出：“国民议会的表决，还不过是隐约反映了一点点席卷全国的怒潮而已”。
