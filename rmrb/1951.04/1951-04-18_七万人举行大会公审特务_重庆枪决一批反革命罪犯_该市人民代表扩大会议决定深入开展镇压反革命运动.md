Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 16th. Chongqing held a public trial of counter-revolutionary elements on the 11th. Seventy thousand people attended the meeting, and 300,000 people listened to the live broadcast of the meeting.

People from all walks of life were in high spirits, coming to participate in the public trial with gongs and drums. Farmers from the suburbs, more than 30 miles away, also came in groups to participate. When the counter-revolutionary criminals were escorted to the venue in prison vans, people shouted in unison, "Resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionaries!"

The public trial began at 1 p.m. Song Xuewu, the presiding judge of the Military Tribunal of the Chongqing Military Control Commission, presided over the trial, with Li Tangbin, Pan Dakui, Xu Chonglin and other representatives of democratic parties and people's organizations serving as jurors. When the person in charge of the public security department of the Military Control Commission filed a public prosecution against these counter-revolutionary criminals, the whole venue was filled with excitement, and tens of thousands of arms were raised, demanding the execution of these heinous counter-revolutionary elements. Those who had suffered persecution by special agents and bandits requested to come to the stage to accuse them. A woman, Hong Fang, tearfully recounted the tragic experience of Dai Li's guard, Hong Liang, killing her father, seizing her mother, and finally raping her. She angrily shouted, "Please, the People's Government, execute Hong Liang!" The masses under the stage were moved by her accusation and shouted in unison, "Execute him!" Xue Zhiyou, a female special agent who had consistently sabotaged the patriotic student movement, had her daughter, Chen Guozhen, also come from school to accuse her special agent mother. She said, "Special agents have no humanity. I don't recognize her as my mother. Please government execute her to eliminate harm for the people!"

Among the counter-revolutionary elements publicly tried this time, there were many special agents with heinous crimes, such as Cai Jianhua, a Kuomintang secret agent who personally arrested and shot thirteen democratic figures, including Du Bincheng, in Xi'an in 1947, and Zhang Shaorong, a major special agent who personally killed Communist Party member Che Yaoxian and others while serving as the warden of the "Baigongguan" detention center at the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" in Chongqing in 1945. There were also some who continued to do evil after liberation, such as the chief special agents Luo Hanzhang and Lü Chuanlu, who sneaked into our factories to sabotage economic construction.

After the presiding judge, Song Xuewu, sentenced these heinous counter-revolutionary elements to death, applause thundered from under the stage. People flocked to the execution ground to see the fate of this group of special agent executioners whose hands were stained with the blood of the people. A housewife pointed to the corpse of a special agent and said, "If we don't kill you, we can't live a peaceful life!"

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 16th. The Chongqing People's Representatives Enlarged Conference, convened to discuss the punishment of counter-revolutionary criminals and to further carry out the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, was held on the 4th. Participants included 577 representatives from the city's democratic parties, people's organizations, government agencies, factories, and schools, as well as members of district consultation committees. 300,000 citizens in the city listened to the live broadcast of the conference. More than 1,000 blackboards in the city's streets quickly wrote out the listening situation.

Liu Minghui, director of the Chongqing Public Security Bureau, made a report on the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries at the meeting. Representatives of democratic parties, people's organizations, and religious circles, such as Xia Zhongshi and Xu Chonglin, spoke at the meeting, unanimously supporting the People's Government's measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries and demanding the resolute implementation of the policy of "those who should be killed, kill; those who should be imprisoned, imprison; those who should be controlled, control," and to promptly deal with the arrested counter-revolutionary elements and give them the punishment they deserved.

Those who had been brutally persecuted by special agents, bullies, and reactionary secret society leaders took the stage to accuse them with indignation. Luo Guangbin, a youth who escaped from the Zhazidong of the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization," recounted the cruel situation of the American and Chiang Kai-shek special agents using more than 130 kinds of torture to harm patriotic people. Zhu Linxia, a student from the private Zhengyang College, accused the special agent Zhang Jiajin of raping her and threatening her to join a counter-revolutionary organization. Zhu Linxia's accusation aroused the indignation of all the representatives. Students from Southwest Industrial College and Chongqing University, who listened to the broadcast, immediately wrote letters to comfort her, encouraging her to wipe away her tears and fight to demand blood debts from American imperialism. Ma Cundi, a worker whose right leg was blown off by a special agent, supported himself with crutches and took the stage to accuse the special agent of blowing up his family of six and maiming himself when he blew up the factory on the eve of Chongqing's liberation. Fu Chongxi, a child who was tricked into poisoning by the special agent Zhang Hanqing, accused: "The special agent Zhang Hanqing used candy and movies to trick us into organizing the 'Big Knife Team,' specializing in tearing up slogans, shouting reactionary slogans, and putting poison. Now we have recognized Zhang Hanqing's harmful behavior. We demand that the government severely suppress them." Hu Zeyuan, a 14-year-old student from Baxian Middle School, immediately called the conference after listening to Fu Chongxi's accusation on the radio, saying that he was also one of those who was used by special agents to tear up slogans, and he thanked Fu Chongxi's report for saving him.

During the conference, the 300,000 citizens in the city who listened to the broadcast were filled with grief, indignation, and excitement. They shouted slogans and applauded with the conference representatives, making nearly a thousand phone calls and writing hundreds of letters to the conference. Many people accused while listening, and some immediately reported special agents.

    这次公审的反革命分子中，有不少是罪大恶极的特务分子，如一九四七年在西安亲手逮捕并枪杀民主人士杜斌丞等十三人的军统特务蔡剑华，一九四五年在重庆“中美合作所”任“白公馆”看守所长亲手杀害中共党员车耀先等的大特务张绍荣；还有一些是解放后继续作恶，潜入我工厂破坏经济建设的首恶特务分子罗汉章、吕传禄等。

    曾经惨遭特务、恶霸、反动会门头子迫害的人都激愤的上台控诉。从“中美合作所”的渣滓洞脱险的青年罗广斌诉说了他亲眼看见的美蒋特务用一百三十多种酷刑残害爱国人士的残忍情况。私立正阳学院学生朱麟霞控诉特务分子张家金强奸她，又威胁她参加反革命组织的经过。朱麟霞的哭诉，引起了全体代表的激愤，收听广播的西南工业专科学校、重庆大学等校学生都在听完朱麟霞控诉后，立刻写信慰问她，鼓励她擦干眼泪，为向美帝国主义索回血债而斗争。被特务炸断右腿的工人马存弟，扶着拐杖上台控诉特务分子在重庆解放前夕炸毁工厂时把她一家六口炸死，自己也被炸成残废的罪恶。被特务张汉卿诱骗放毒的小孩傅崇西控诉说：“特务张汉卿用糖果和看电影来骗我们，叫我们组织“大刀队”，专门撕标语，喊反动口号，放毒药。现在我们认清了张汉卿的害人行为，我们要求政府严厉镇压他们。”巴县中学十四岁的学生胡泽元在收音机中听了傅崇西控诉后，立刻打电话给大会，诉说他也是被特务分子利用来撕标语的一个，他感谢傅崇西的报告救了他。
