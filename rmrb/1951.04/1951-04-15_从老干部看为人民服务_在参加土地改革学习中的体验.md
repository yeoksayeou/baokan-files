Serving the People as Seen by Veteran Cadres
    —— Experiences from Participating in Land Reform Studies
    Sun Yutang, Professor, Tsinghua University

    This time, I followed the East China Land Reform Visiting Group to the countryside of Wujiang County, Southern Jiangsu, to study land reform. On the way there, I listened to detailed and substantial reports from comrades at all levels responsible for land reform work. In the countryside, I carefully studied and partially participated in land reform work. On the way back, we held many discussions and symposiums. Although the round trip was only a month, I learned a lot. In addition to gaining a better understanding and appreciation of the great revolutionary movement of land reform, what I saw and heard every day constantly inspired me to think. It will take a long time to digest and think about these learnings, and I cannot sort them all out at once. Here, I can only share some of my observations.

  (I)
    At the farewell banquet in Wujiang, I toasted Comrade Jin Peiyang, a veteran cadre who was often with us, saying, "This glass of wine is from a student to his teacher." I was genuinely moved when I said this. During this month of living and working with cadres at all levels in land reform work, their style, spirit, ability, and work methods not only enabled me to learn many things I had never imagined, but also made me increasingly aware of my own emptiness, insignificance, and ignorance.
    Before going to the countryside, we listened to five major reports from comrades responsible for land reform work in Beijing, Shanghai, and Suzhou. The content of these reports was all honest and down-to-earth. From these reports and conversations, one could see the open-minded attitude, the spirit of seeking truth from facts, the ideological method of constantly and effectively grasping the overall complex situation, and the strong leadership ability of the leading cadres at all levels. These not only inspired respect but also naturally made one willing to follow their guidance. In particular, seeing how they constantly showed their concern for their subordinates, considered everything for them, and how the subordinates sincerely and willingly obeyed the leadership of their superiors, was truly moving.
    After going to the countryside and living and working with veteran cadres at the county and district levels, there were more opportunities to specifically recognize and appreciate the above-mentioned spirit and style. Making friends with them is truly like being in a gentle spring breeze. They are always so modest, frank, sincere, and enthusiastic to their comrades, and getting along with them is like being with family. During our half-month in the countryside, the work process was ending the stage of class division, arranging struggle sessions, collecting the four major properties (referring to: houses, surplus grain, farm tools, and livestock), and distributing land. Both of these tasks were quite complex. The first deep impression the veteran cadres gave me was that they were always so careful and cautious in their investigation and research, understanding the situation, remaining calm and patient, not being afraid of trouble, and basing everything on real and concrete materials. Only after a comprehensive and in-depth grasp of the situation would they formulate plans and determine steps. When it came to actual action (such as preparing for a struggle session), they had a firm stance, courage, and emotion, trusted the masses, and had a sharp fighting spirit. After completing a task, they immediately humbly reviewed, calmly checked, analyzed the factors of success and failure, and summarized their experiences. They were not complacent with success, but only calmly summarized the reasons for success and checked for defects in success. They were not afraid of mistakes or failures. After mistakes or failures, they did not panic or become discouraged, but only calmly reviewed the reasons for the failure and tried to correct them. They regularly reported, understood the overall development of the work, and constantly checked, researched, and corrected. Criticism and self-criticism were almost the core of their work.
    The style of the veteran cadres was further manifested in the mass line. They trusted the wisdom and strength of the masses, so they only used methods of enlightenment to encourage the masses to think for themselves and come up with their own solutions. They did not talk about theory, did not recite dogmas, did not use the big hat of policy to suppress people, did not pour cold water on the masses, and cherished the creativity of the masses. When the masses went astray, they patiently enlightened them until they were guided back on the right track. Whenever the masses displayed wisdom, they not only humbly learned but also improved themselves. This style not only satisfied every member of the masses and made them willing to follow their leadership, but also developed the intelligence of the masses, enabling them to strengthen their self-confidence and fully understand the spirit of democratic centralism. I paid close attention to a veteran cadre who was often with us to see how far he could go with the mass line. As a result, in half a month, he never made a single mistake of bureaucratism, commandism, individual heroism, or paternalism, except for one time when he was too anxious and said a few extra words.
    Being with veteran cadres, one only felt that they were a piece of steel full of wisdom. What was the reason? The friends who were traveling with me also discussed it together. Our conclusion was that this style and ability basically stemmed from the selfless spirit of truly serving the people wholeheartedly. In the hearts of these veteran cadres, the word "I" had completely disappeared. They lived extremely frugally, were loyal to the people's cause, were serious and conscientious in their work, and did not care about their own personal successes or failures in everything. This truly made people respect, envy, and love them. Having intimately known these comrades, we truly recognized the cultivation of the communists, the education of the Communist Party, and the great spirit of the proletariat. This recognition made us undoubtedly affirm a belief: with these workers who serve the people, nothing will go wrong in our people's new China; under the strong leadership of Chairman Mao and the People's Government, our country will surely move forward steadily towards brightness and greater brightness day by day.
    In addition to the veteran cadres, we also got to know many young new cadres. Most of them were young intellectuals and students who voluntarily participated in the land reform work team in Southern Jiangsu. These young people had undergone short-term study and training, but compared to the veteran cadres, they were obviously lacking in style, cultivation, and ability. They sometimes revealed a little individual heroism, were not careful enough, got emotional, or were impatient and rash. However, after several months of training in land reform work, close integration with the peasants, and the assistance and leadership of the veteran cadres, they had become a generation of lovable new youth in the new era. Their lives had been completely integrated with the peasants, and their stand was firmly on the side of the peasants. They were very capable of enduring hardship and were willing to work hard. For the sake of work, they sometimes went hungry for several nights without sleep, running through several villages in the middle of the night in the rain. Their eyes were red, and their voices were hoarse, but their spirits were always so full of joy. Their spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people was no less than that of the veteran cadres, and they did much important work in the land reform process. Although they had only been working for a short time, they were obviously making rapid progress every day. Land reform work is a great melting pot. Land reform will be completed, and this generation of young people will also be educated and transformed. We imagined that in a few years, these young people would all be trained to become veteran cadres, and we felt that our new China was truly like the rising sun, and the future brightness and hope were truly limitless.

  (II)
    Land reform is a great ideological education. It is not about who educates whom, but about everyone who participates in this great mass movement educating themselves. The ideological and emotional level of the peasants was raised, the youth progressed and improved in their work, and the veteran cadres also made further progress. It made our entire country move forward rapidly.
    I myself participated for a short time, and I felt a little ashamed compared to the hard-working peasant brothers and the land reform comrades. However, I asked myself, what have I learned? After calming down and deeply examining my thoughts, I also affirmed one point: after this month, although I did not gain as much as others, I did learn a lot. This learning gave me many new understandings and aroused many new emotions. These thoughts and emotions can be summarized in one sentence: I have increased my respect, love, and confidence in Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government, and the great future of our entire country many times over. I am fortunate to be born in such a great era, and I am fortunate that I still have half my life to work hard for the people under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the true leader of the people.
    Speaking of serving the people, one should establish a proletarian stance like the cadres. After this month of study, I asked myself whether I had initially established this position?
    I carefully examined my thoughts, and I could not answer. I am an intellectual from a petty-bourgeois background, and I have been educated in a capitalist style in the past. My background and education have given me many shortcomings and weaknesses in my thinking, making me feel empty, weak, insignificant, and ignorant when I am with the cadres and peasants. If I had gone to the countryside two years ago, I am afraid that I would not even have this feeling of inferiority. I have also worked hard to learn in the past two years. Although I have not learned enough, it has more or less had some impact on my thinking, and I have initially recognized the workers and peasants and myself rationally. However, the learning of the past two years has only been book learning, so the understanding is very vague, superficial, and unrealistic, and the emotions have always failed to keep up with reason. Although I only studied for a month during my participation in land reform, I felt that what I gained far exceeded my learning in the past two years. After this study, I felt that whether in reason or emotion, there was no problem in always standing on the side of the workers and peasants; like the young cadres, I could understand policies, promote policies, help workers and peasants, and strive to serve the people in general. However, can I, who has been carrying the burden of a petty-bourgeois intellectual for many years, be considered transformed? Frankly speaking, it is still far from enough. The many remaining shortcomings need to be washed away for a long time; if I want to stand with the workers and peasants without feeling ashamed, I need to work hard to learn for a long time. To say that I have completely established a proletarian stance today is obviously incorrect.
    In order to further establish a proletarian stance, I told myself that I must work hard in many ways in the future. First of all, I must find more opportunities to integrate with the workers and peasants, understand their lives, and feel their feelings; I must gain more experience in practical work and mass life so that my learning can be constantly linked to reality. Secondly, I must strengthen the study of revolutionary theory so that this learning can be combined with practice to wash away the many old ideas that remain in me. I am a history educator, and the transformation of this profession itself can give me a test. Chairman Mao said that there are only two kinds of knowledge in the world: knowledge of production struggle and knowledge of class struggle. Measuring with this truth, I deeply feel that a considerable part of my previous knowledge was neither knowledge of production struggle nor knowledge of class struggle, but only a pile of dross texts. As for the real knowledge of production struggle and class struggle, there is still a large blank space in my mind that needs to be filled with hard study. Washing away the dross, filling the blank space, and transforming myself into a historical worker suitable for the needs of the workers and peasants is my minimum direction of effort. If I cannot even do this, then not only will I not be able to establish a proletarian stance, but I will also fail the people and fail the era.

　　从老干部看为人民服务
    ——在参加土地改革学习中的体验
    清华大学教授  孙毓棠
    我这次随华东土地改革参观团到苏南吴江县乡间学习土地改革，去时一路听各级负责土地改革工作同志详确而充实的报告，在乡间仔细学习了并部分参加了土地改革工作，回来时一路举行了很多讨论会座谈会，往返虽仅一个月，但学习所得实在很多。除了对土地改革这伟大革命运动得到了比以前较多的了解与体会外，每日所见所闻都时时在启发自己去想。这些学习所得需要较长的时间消化思考，一时还不能全部理出头绪来。这里只能把一部分观感说一说。
  （一）
    在吴江话别的筵席上，我曾向和我们常在一起的一位老干部金佩扬同志敬酒，说“这杯酒是学生敬老师的”。我说这话时心中着实动了感情。这一个月和各级土地改革工作干部在一起生活工作，他们的作风、精神、能力与工作方法，不仅使自己学习到很多从来没有想像到的东西，而且使自己日益感觉自己的空虚，渺小与无知。
    下乡以前，我们在北京、上海、苏州一路听了负责土地改革工作同志的五次大报告。这些报告的内容，都是老老实实脚踏实地的。从这些报告以及谈话接触中，可以看出各级领导干部虚心坦怀的态度，实事求是的精神，以及经常切实掌握全面复杂情况发展的思想方法和坚强的领导能力。这些不仅使人心中油然起敬佩之感，很自然地愿意依从他们的指导。尤其看到他们时时流露出来的上级爱护下级，事事为下级考虑周到，和下级真心情愿服从上级领导的情形，着实使人感动。
    下乡以后，和县区级老干部们在一起生活工作，上面所说的精神与作风便更得有机会具体地认识体会。和他们做朋友确实像在漾漾春风之中，他们对同志们总是那样虚心、坦白、恳挚、热诚，相处总似一家兄弟一样。我们在乡村的半个月期间，工作进程正在结束划分阶级，布置斗争会进缴四大财产（指：房屋、余粮、农具、牲畜）与分配土地的阶段。这两种工作都相当复杂。老干部们给我第一深刻印象，就是他们在工作里永远那样细心谨慎地调查研究，了解情况，冷静忍耐，不怕麻烦，事事要根据真实具体的材料。当情况全面深入地掌握后，他们才制定计划，确定步骤。到了实际行动时（例如酝酿进行一个斗争会），他们立场坚定，有勇气，有感情，信任群众，有尖锐的斗争精神。一件事情做完后，立刻便虚心检讨，冷静检查，分析成败的因素，总结经验。他们不为成功自满，只冷静总结成功的原因，并在成功中检查缺陷。他们不怕错误或失败，错误失败后不慌乱、不沮丧，只冷静检讨失败的原因，设法纠正。他们经常进行汇报，了解工作全面发展情况，不断地在检查研究纠正。批评与自我批评对他们几乎是工作的核心部分。
    老干部们的作风更表现于群众路线方面。他们信任群众的智慧与力量，所以任何事都只用启发的方法，启发群众自己思考，自己想办法。他们不谈理论，不背教条，不用政策大帽子压人，不向群众泼冷水，珍视群众的创造力。群众发生偏向时，他们以极强的忍耐力慢慢再启发，最后终能导入正轨；每逢群众发挥了智慧，他们不只虚心学习，并且随着把自己也提高一步。这种作风不仅使每个群众满意，愿意随从他们的领导；而且发挥了群众的智力，使群众日日加强了自信，充分了解了民主集中的精神。我曾留心注意一位和我们常在一起的老干部，看他群众路线能做到什么地步；结果在半个月期间，除了一次因为实在令人着急而多说了几句话外，他从来没有犯过一点官僚主义，命令主义，个人英雄主义或包办代替的毛病。
    和老干部们在一起，只觉得他们是充满着智慧的一块钢。什么原因？同行的朋友们也一起讨论过。我们的结论是这种作风与能力基本上根源于真正全心全意为人民服务的忘我精神。在这些老干部们心中，“我”字已全不存在。他们生活极刻苦，对人民事业忠诚，对工作严肃认真，一切事不计较自己个人的成败得失，这些实在使人心中对他们由敬而羡而爱。亲切地认识了这些同志，我们才真正认识了共产党人的修养，共产党的教育，和无产阶级伟大的精神。这个认识使我们毫无疑问地肯定了一个信念：我们人民的新中国有了这些为人民服务的工作者，一切事绝不会干不好；我们的国家在毛主席与人民政府坚强的领导下，一定会一天天脚踏实地地走向光明和更大的光明。
    老干部以外，我们也结识了不少年青的新干部。他们多半是知识分子青年学生，自动参加苏南土地改革工作队的。这些青年曾经过短期的学习与训练，但比起老干部们来，在作风修养能力方面，显然还差一些。他们有时还会流露出来一点个人英雄主义，不够细心谨慎，闹点情绪，或急躁草率的毛病。然而几个月在土地改革工作中的锻炼，与农民的密切结合，和老干部们的协助领导，他们已经成了新时代一辈可爱新青年。他们的生活已和农民完全打成一片，立场已坚定地站在农民这一边。他们很能耐劳吃苦，为工作有时饿着肚子几晚不睡觉，深夜顶着雨跑几个村庄，一个个眼红红的、嗓子都是哑的，而精神却总是那样饱满愉快。他们这种全心全意为人民服务的精神实不亚于老干部们，土地改革过程中许多重要工作都是他们做的。他们参加工作时间虽短，但显然一天天在很快地进步提高。土地改革工作是一个伟大的熔炉，土地改革将完成了，这一辈青年也教育成了，改造成了。我们想像着这般青年几年以后一个个都能锻炼成为老干部，便觉我们的新中国真像旭日初升，未来的光明和希望真是不可限量的。
  （二）
    土地改革是一个伟大的思想教育。并不是谁教育谁，是参加的每个人在这伟大的群众运动中教育了自己。农民思想情绪提高了，青年们在工作中进步提高了，老干部们也一样更进步了；他使我们整个国家在急速迈进。
    我自己参加的时间短，比起农民劳苦兄弟和土地改革工作同志们自觉有些惭愧；但也曾问自己学习了什么？静下心深深检查一下自己的思想，也肯定了一点：经过这一个月，自己虽不如旁人收获多，但也着实学习了不少的东西。这学习给了我许多新的认识，激起我许多新的情感。——这些思想与情感大体可以归结于一句话：自己对于毛主席、中国共产党、人民政府、和我们整个国家伟大的前途，增加了很多倍的崇敬、爱、与信心。自己庆幸能生在这样一个伟大的时代，庆幸自己还有半生能在真正人民的领袖毛主席的领导下努力为人民服务。
    说到为人民服务，便应该和干部们一样建立起无产阶级的立场。经过这一个月的学习，我曾问自己是否初步建立了这个立场？
    我仔细检查了自己的思想，我不会回答。我是个小资产阶级出身的知识分子，以往受的是资本主义式的教育，出身与教育使自己思想中有着许许多多的毛病和弱点，使自己和干部农民们在一起时感到自己的空虚、懦弱、渺小和无知。若在两年以前下乡，怕连这点自卑的感觉都不会有。两年来也曾努力学习，虽然学习得还很不够，但多多少少对自己的思想发生了一些影响，初步在理性上认识了工农，认识了自己。然而两年来的学习也只是书本上的学习，因此认识也十分朦胧、肤浅、不切实，而且感情始终追随不上理性。这次在参加土地改革中学习虽仅一个月，自觉所得实远超过以往两年的学习。经过这次学习，自己觉得不管在理性上感情上，永远和工农站在一边已没有什么问题；和青年干部一样了解政策，推行政策，帮助工农，努力为人民服务，大体也都可做到。但是，我这多年背着小资产阶级知识分子的包袱的人，是否已经算是改造了呢？平心而论，还差得很远很远。满身残留着的缺点还需要长时间冲洗；要想和工农站在一起而不觉惭愧，还需要长时间努力学习。要说今天自己已经完全建立了无产阶级立场，显然是不正确的。
    要想进一步建立无产阶级立场，我嘱咐自己今后得从多方面努力。首先，得多找机会和工农结合，认识他们的生活，感受他们的感觉；得多在实际工作中和群众生活中锻炼经历，使自己的学习能经常联系实际。其次，得加强革命理论的学习，使这种学习结合着实践来冲洗自己残留着的许多旧的思想。我是个历史教育工作者，这业务本身的改造便可以给自己一个考验。毛主席说过，世界上知识只有两种：生产斗争的知识和阶级斗争的知识。拿这个真理来衡量，我深觉以往自己的知识里实在有相当部分既非生产斗争的知识又非阶级斗争的知识，只不过一堆糟粕文字而已。至于真正生产斗争、阶级斗争的知识，自己脑中却还存在着一大块空白，需要努力学习方能填补。冲洗糟粕，填补空白，把自己改造成为一个适合工农需要的历史工作者，是自己最低限度的努力方向。如果这一点都做不到，则不仅无产阶级立场建立不起来，而且会辜负人民，辜负时代。
