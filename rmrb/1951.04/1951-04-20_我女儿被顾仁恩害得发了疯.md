Reader's Letter

　　My daughter was driven mad by Gu Ren'en

　　To the Editor:

　　I was very happy to see in the People's Daily the news of the Qingdao Municipal People's Government arresting Gu Ren'en, a scum in Christianity and a running dog of American imperialism. Now, I want to accuse Gu Ren'en of his crimes!

　　My daughter, Yang Xiuying, was deceived and raped by Gu Ren'en in his secret preaching room! My daughter suffered a nervous breakdown and went mad as a result. This has been going on for six years, and I have been enduring the pain and injustice without being able to appeal anywhere. My daughter's madness has not improved, and she is still locked in bed. Every day, when I see her pale and painful face, and when I hear the sound of the shackles on her feet, I remember my enemy—Gu Ren'en, who is full of benevolence and morality but has the heart of a viper!

　　My daughter, Yang Xiuying, is a Christian. She graduated from Beijing Chongci Girls' High School eight years ago. In 1945, she worked as a nurse in the Health Clinic of the former Beiping Women's Factory. At that time, Gu Ren'en preached in the Gulou West Church in the city, and Xiuying often went to listen with some girlfriends. Gu Ren'en had bad intentions towards these girls and used various means to seduce them. He called himself their "spiritual father" and was willing to open a special altar for them to preach. Xiuying and others fell for his trick and went to listen every day. One day, Gu Ren'en said to Xiuying: "You need to deepen your studies. From today onwards, I will give you individual lectures." That very night, the beast in human clothing, Gu Ren'en, raped my daughter in his secret preaching room.

　　After Xiuying was raped, we were afraid of losing face if we made a fuss about it, and we even wanted Xiuying to endure the humiliation and marry him. Gu Ren'en shamelessly refused as usual, and he also said: "My wife must be able to play the piano and speak fluent American." Xiuying could not bear such humiliation and thought of going to Gu Ren'en's preaching place to reason with him. Gu Ren'en hired some male and female hooligans, grabbed Xiuying to the small house in the backyard of the church, tied her up with ropes, and punched and kicked her until Gu Ren'en finished preaching and left the church before releasing her. Compatriots! This is how Gu Ren'en, wearing the cloak of religion, harms the people!

　　Once, when Gu Ren'en was preaching in Tianjin, Xiuying went to him to reason, but she was beaten half to death by the hooligans he hired. Another time, Gu Ren'en beat Xiuying until her face was covered in blood in the Yasili Church in Chongwenmennei, Beijing. After being carried home, she was unconscious. I went to the church to accuse him, but Gu Ren'en, relying on the power of the American robbers, controlled the church, so the church naturally did not care about this matter. The devastation and humiliation Xiuying suffered at the time had no place to appeal, and as a result, she developed a serious mental illness. After many treatments, they were ultimately ineffective. She often secretly ran to the street, shouting loudly, and finally fell on the road. I had no choice but to lock her legs with iron chains; for nearly three years, she has been locked in bed all year round.

　　Xiuying, my daughter, a good girl, was harmed by Gu Ren'en in this way.

　　This grievance is like a stone pressing on my heart. Today, I want to say it out loud. I demand that the People's Government severely suppress this American spy Gu Ren'en, who is wearing the cloak of religion, and avenge my daughter.

### 我女儿被顾仁恩害得发了疯

　  我女儿被顾仁恩害得发了疯编辑同志：
    我在人民日报上看到青岛市人民政府逮捕基督教中的败类、美帝国主义的走狗顾仁恩的消息，心里非常高兴。现在，我要控诉顾仁恩的罪恶！
    我的女儿杨秀英被顾仁恩骗到他的秘密讲道室里奸污了！我女儿因此神经失常以致发疯。这事已经六年了，我一直忍痛含冤无处伸诉。我女儿的疯病现在还没有好，还被锁在床上。每天，我一看见她那惨无人色和充满痛苦的脸庞，我一听见她所带的脚镣的响声，我就记起了我的仇人——满嘴仁义道德而有毒蛇心肠的顾仁恩！
    我的女儿杨秀英是个基督教徒。八年前毕业于北京崇慈女中。一九四五年，她在前北平妇女工厂卫生所当护士。当时，顾仁恩在本市鼓楼西教会里讲道，秀英常常和几个女朋友去听道。顾仁恩对这几个女孩子起了坏心，就用各种手段诱骗她们。他自称是她们“灵魂的父亲”，愿为她们专开教坛讲道。秀英等中了他的诡计，每天都去听讲。有一天，顾仁恩对秀英说：“你需要再加深造。从今天起，我给你进行个别讲道。”就在那天晚上，人面兽心的顾仁恩在他的秘密讲道室里把我的女儿强奸了。
    秀英被奸污后，我们当时还怕嚷出去面子不好看，还想让秀英忍辱和他结婚。顾仁恩却照例无耻地拒绝了，他还说：“我的太太要会弹钢琴、会说流利的美国话才行。”秀英不能忍受他这样的污辱，想到顾仁恩讲道的场所找他说理。顾仁恩就雇了一些男女流氓，把秀英抓到教堂后院的小屋里，用绳子捆绑起来，拳打脚踢，直到顾仁恩讲完道离开教堂以后才把她放出来。同胞们！顾仁恩就是这样披着宗教的外衣残害人民呵！
    有一次，顾仁恩在天津讲道，秀英去找他理论，结果也被他雇用的流氓打得半死。又有一次，顾仁恩在北京崇文门内亚斯礼堂内把秀英打得满脸流血，抬回家后，已昏迷不醒人事。我到教会去控诉，但顾仁恩仗着美国强盗的势力，把持教会，教会当然也就不管这事。秀英所受的摧残和污辱，在当时无处伸冤，结果，逼得她得了严重的神经病。经过多次治疗终归无效。他常偷偷跑到街上，大叫大嚷，最后倒在马路上。我没法，只得忍心地把她的腿用铁链子锁住；近三年多，她就长年地被锁在床上。
    秀英，我的女儿，一个好好的女孩子，就这样被顾仁恩残害了。
    这冤仇，像一块石头压在我的心上。今天，我要把它说出来。我要求人民政府严厉镇压这个披着宗教外衣的美国特务顾仁恩，给我的女儿报仇。
        基督教徒  李绍彭
