　　U.S. Policy of Enslaving the Japanese People Remains Unchanged
    Ridgway Issues Statement in Japan, Will Continue to Vigorously Promote Separate Peace
    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th] The new Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Occupation Forces in Japan, Ridgway, issued a statement in Tokyo, Japan, on the 14th, announcing that he would continue to implement all of MacArthur's policies of enslaving the Japanese people and would do his best to promote a separate peace treaty with Japan by the United States. In his statement, Ridgway said that he would "with all his power, do his utmost" to "assist in completing" Truman's plan to conclude a separate peace with Japan as soon as possible.
    Ridgway announced that the U.S.'s "basic policy" toward Japan "has not changed." He also said in a tone resolutely hostile to the Japanese people: "I have an unwavering purpose to complete this meticulous work that has been largely completed under the flawless leadership and guidance of General MacArthur." In his statement, Ridgway also "encouraged" the Japanese reactionaries to "continue" the work of "strengthening and expanding the consolidation" of fascist rule.

    李奇微宣布，美国的对日“基本政策并没有改变”。他并以坚决与日本人民为敌的口吻说：“我抱着坚定不移的目的，要完成这件在麦克阿瑟将军完美无缺的领导和指示下已经大部分完成了的细致的工作。”李奇微在声明中同时“鼓励”日本反动派把“加强和扩大巩固”法西斯统治的工作“继续下去”。
