Column: Opinions on the Distribution Work of This Newspaper

　　Welcome the Broad Masses of Readers to Supervise the Distribution Work of This Newspaper
Editor Comrade:
    Recently, I have continuously seen the People's Daily's second page, in the "Letters from Readers" column, publish many opinions from readers regarding the newspaper's distribution work. I believe this is very necessary. I am a long-term reader of the People's Daily, and I have personally experienced situations such as errors, delays, and inconveniences in subscribing to the newspaper. In the past, I thought these were individual problems, so I did not formally express my opinions to the post office or the newspaper office. Recently, according to what I know and what I have seen in the newspaper, these situations are indeed quite widespread, especially in small counties and townships where transportation is not very convenient.
    Since the "integration of postal and distribution services," there have indeed been many benefits for both the distribution work itself and the readers. However, because the post office does not yet have sufficient experience with this new work, there are inevitably many shortcomings. The People's Daily reaches all parts of the country, and it is impossible for the post office and the newspaper office themselves to deeply understand the problems that exist in distribution. Distribution work is the most direct bridge connecting the Party newspaper with the masses, and it has the closest relationship with every reader. Therefore, I believe that only by relying on the broad masses of readers can we discover the problems in distribution work, and only by listening to the opinions of the broad masses of readers can we improve the distribution work. Therefore, I very much approve of publishing readers' opinions on distribution work in the newspaper. At the same time, I also hope that those who offer opinions should not only raise problems but also propose concrete improvement measures.
                                                Reader Zhou Yi
    Editor's Note: Comrade Zhou Yi's opinion is very good. We welcome all readers of this newspaper to supervise the distribution work of this newspaper; at the same time, we also hope to provide more improvement measures to make the distribution work of the Party newspaper better.

### 欢迎广大读者监督本报发行工作

专栏：对本报发行工作的意见

　　欢迎广大读者监督本报发行工作编辑同志：
    最近接连看到人民日报第二版《读者来信》栏发表了不少关于读者对报纸发行工作的意见，我认为这是很必要的。我是人民日报的长期读者之一，关于报纸的差错、迟误、订报不方便等情形，我都亲身体验过。过去我以为这是个别问题，所以我没有向邮局和报社正式提意见，近来据我所知道的和在报上所看到的，这些情形确是相当普遍地存在着，尤其是在交通不大方便的小县份和乡镇中。
    “邮发合一”以来，对发行工作本身和读者来说，确是有很多好处，但是由于邮政局对这件新的工作，还没有足够的经验，所以不可避免地是有很多缺点的。人民日报遍及全国，邮局和报社本身是不可能深入了解发行中所存在的问题。发行工作是党报联系群众最直接的桥梁，它与每个读者都有着最密切的关系，所以我以为，惟有依靠广大读者才能发现发行工作中的问题，惟有听取广大读者的意见，才能改善发行工作。因此我对于在报上发表读者对发行工作的意见，是非常赞成的。同时我也希望提意见的人，不仅提出问题，更应提出具体的改进办法。
                                                读者  周怡
    编者按：周怡同志的意见是很好的，我们欢迎所有本报读者来监督本报的发行工作；同时也希望提供更多的改进办法，把党报的发行工作搞得更好。
