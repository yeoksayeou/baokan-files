　　Propaganda Outline for "May Fourth" Youth Day
　　What was the "May Fourth Movement"?
　　Thirty-two years ago, on May 4, 1919, the "May Fourth Movement" took place in Beijing. This was a great patriotic movement of the Chinese people and the beginning of China's new democratic revolution.
　　At that time, World War I had just ended. The imperialist countries, such as Germany and Austria, were defeated in the war. The victorious imperialist countries, such as Britain, France, and the United States, held a "peace conference" in Paris, France, to divide the spoils. Although China also joined Britain, France, the United States, and Japan in fighting against Germany and Austria during the war, the Japanese imperialists took advantage of the traitor Yuan Shikai's desire to become emperor and forced him to recognize the "Twenty-One Demands" that would have led to the destruction of China. They also used the pretext that Shandong Province had a German concession and sent troops to occupy Qingdao and other places in Shandong. The representatives of the Chinese government at the time, under pressure from the people, demanded at the Paris "Peace Conference" the return of Shandong's special rights and the denial of the "Twenty-One Demands." However, the imperialist robbers of Britain, France, Japan, and the United States did not agree to China's just demands. This aroused the anger of the entire Chinese people and led to a great anti-imperialist and patriotic demonstration movement.
　　On May 4th, more than 5,000 students in Beijing held a patriotic demonstration. The angry masses beat up Zhang Zongxiang (then the ambassador to Japan), who was in charge of diplomatic affairs with Japan, and others. The traitorous Beijing reactionary government at the time adopted high-handed measures and arrested many students. Students all over Beijing and all over China angrily protested and went on strike. By June 3rd, the working class and merchants in many cities across the country also joined the movement, holding strikes and market boycotts. The momentum of the masses was huge, like a prairie fire, and this turned into a nationwide great patriotic movement. The Beijing reactionary government was forced to dismiss Cao Rulin (the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs when the "Twenty-One Demands" were signed, who was then the Minister of Communications), Lu Zongyu, Zhang Zongxiang, and other traitors from their posts, and was forced to refuse to sign the Treaty of Versailles. This movement shook all of China and the world.
　　Why were the Chinese people able to hold such a great anti-imperialist and patriotic movement at that time? First of all, it was because the Chinese nation and the Chinese people had long suffered from the cruel oppression of imperialism and feudalism, and their suffering was so deep that the Chinese society harbored an extremely urgent demand for revolution. During World War I, some imperialist countries were busy fighting wars and had to temporarily relax their economic aggression against China, and China's national industry and commerce developed somewhat. This development strengthened the Chinese working class.
　　The "May Fourth Movement" was led by intellectuals who believed in communism. Before the "May Fourth Movement," the success of the Russian October Revolution brought the revolutionary truth of Marxism-Leninism to China. The great October Revolution greatly inspired the oppressed Chinese people and found a path to liberation. The "May Fourth Movement" took place under the influence of the great October Revolution. After the "May Fourth Movement," the number of people who believed in communism increased day by day. In 1921—two years after the "May Fourth Movement"—the Chinese Communist Party was founded. From then on, the face of the Chinese revolution was completely renewed. The "May Fourth Movement" marked the end of the era of China's old democratic revolution and the beginning of the era of the new democratic revolution.
　　The "May Fourth Movement" fully demonstrated the revolutionary spirit and great power of Chinese youth, so May 4th was designated as Youth Day. And the Chinese New Democratic Youth League was also born two years ago on "May Fourth," so "May Fourth" is also the anniversary of the founding of the Youth League.
　　Why commemorate "May Fourth" Youth Day?
　　The purpose of the "May Fourth" patriotic movement was to thoroughly overthrow the imperialism and feudal forces that oppressed the Chinese people and turn the poor and backward China into an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous new China.
　　For thirty years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, our Chinese people have experienced countless sacrifices and struggles, and finally overthrew the rule of imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek in China, and established the People's Republic of China in 1949, producing the Central People's Government. The Chinese people have truly stood up from then on and truly become the masters of the country. In the past year or so, our People's Government has completed many great tasks and created miracles in Chinese history. We have stopped the inflation that lasted for more than ten years, overcome huge famines, and promoted the recovery of agricultural and industrial production. In agriculture, we have achieved bumper harvests. In industry, the working class, with a sense of ownership and conscious labor attitude, has continuously created new records, and the quality of products has been greatly improved. Land reform has been completed in areas with nearly 300 million people, and the lives of workers and peasants have been initially improved. In particular, our great movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, with the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army together, with the warm support of the people of China and Korea and the people of the world, has defeated the extremely vicious US imperialism and the armies of many accomplice countries, and most effectively defended the cause of world peace. Our motherland has become more lovable than ever before. Our motherland will become increasingly stronger and more lovable.
　　Commemorating "May Fourth" can greatly inspire our lofty feelings of loving the motherland.
　　Commemorating "May Fourth," recalling the difficulties and hardships and bloodshed and sacrifices of the thirty-two years of the new democratic revolution, can make us feel the preciousness of the fruits of victory and enable us to actively strive to defend our fruits of victory.
　　Commemorating "May Fourth" can make us hate the enemies of the Chinese people even more, hate the imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries even more, and strengthen our determination to resist US aggression and aid Korea, defend our homes and defend our country, and strengthen our determination to finally eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries and suppress counter-revolutionaries.
　　How to commemorate "May Fourth" Youth Day?
　　(1) This year's commemoration of "May Fourth" must continue to popularize and deepen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The main purpose of US imperialism's aggression against Korea is to attack China. Only by assisting Korea in defeating the US aggressors can we ensure our own peaceful and happy lives. Now the United States and the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit army have been wiped out by us by more than 200,000, and the resistance to US aggression and aid to Korea has made great achievements, but US imperialism not only continues to occupy Taiwan, insists on the war of aggression against Korea, but also constantly bombs the peaceful people of our northeastern cities and villages. Therefore, we must continue to carry out the long-term and arduous struggle against US aggression and aid Korea, and we must give the US imperialists more heavy blows and completely defeat them in order to thwart their conspiracy to expand the war, further ensure the security of the motherland, and effectively defend peace in the Far East and the world.
　　At the same time, we must resolutely oppose the United States' arming of Japan. After the United States was defeated in Korea, it stepped up its efforts to independently conclude a peace treaty with Japan, arm the Japanese reactionaries, and revive Japanese fascism, in an attempt to use Japan as a military base for attacking China and to use Japanese manpower as cannon fodder for attacking China. Our Chinese people have long suffered the most brutal aggression and massacre by Japanese imperialism. Countless of our properties were destroyed and looted by Japanese imperialism; tens of millions of parents, brothers, and sisters were murdered by Japanese imperialism; tens of millions of mothers and sisters were insulted. Can we allow US imperialism to re-arm Japan and come to China to burn, kill, rape, and plunder again? This is absolutely unacceptable. We must completely smash the US imperialism's conspiracy to arm Japan.
　　We must resolutely support the declaration of the World Peace Council on the demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact, and everyone must sign the declaration. If the governments of the United States, Britain, and France do not approve the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, it will make the people of the world see more clearly their sinister faces of deliberately engaging in aggression and war, make them more isolated, and make the people of the world more actively defend peace and smash the imperialists' conspiracy of aggressive war.
　　(2) This year's commemoration of "May Fourth" must strengthen our people's democratic dictatorship, and we must resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries. Although the US imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang have been defeated by us on the mainland, they have left behind a group of secret agents, bandits, local bullies, and reactionary secret society leaders. Some of them are lurking in factories and mines, sabotaging economic construction; some of them are sneaking into government agencies, stealing state secrets; some of them are organizing riots, burning, killing, raping, and plundering; some of them are spreading rumors and poisoning, disrupting social order. For example, recently US-Chiang agents set a fire in Lingling County, Hunan, burning down more than 500 houses, leaving one-tenth of the city homeless. Everyone think about how hateful and abominable these agents are. Recently, the Central People’s Government promulgated the “Regulations of the People’s Republic of China on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries,” which is specifically used to deal with counter-revolutionaries. If we do not suppress counter-revolutionaries, the lives and property of our people will suffer. Therefore, the people of our country should resolutely assist the People's Government and thoroughly eliminate the remaining forces of counter-revolution. We must complete the land reform. One of the most important reasons for the poverty, backwardness, and weakness of old China was that the fruits of the farmers' hard work were mostly exploited by the landlords. To build an industrialized new China, develop production, and live a good life, we must completely eliminate the landlord class economically. At present, land reform has been completed in areas with nearly 300 million agricultural population across the country. We should support the People's Government in successfully completing the national land reform. In order to further strengthen our people's democratic system, we must also hold people's representative conferences well, further strengthen the united front of the four classes within the people, and unite more closely.
　　(3) Every young person should actively work hard in their respective positions. Young workers and young farmers should participate in the "patriotic production competition," young people in government offices should do a good job, young people in schools should strengthen their studies, and religious young people should actively participate in the religious reform movement. Every young person, in order to commemorate "May Fourth," should further improve our level of knowledge and ideology, and turn our daily achievements into a force to attack US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, and become a force to defend the motherland and defend world peace. At present, factories, rural areas, government offices, schools, and streets in various places are formulating patriotic covenants, which is a good way to link anti-Americanism and patriotism with our actual work. Units that have not yet formulated patriotic covenants should quickly formulate them, and those that have already formulated them should strive to implement them.
　　All patriotic young people should unite closely under the great banner of patriotism, and under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, continue to carry forward the patriotic spirit of the Chinese people since the "May Fourth" Movement, and thoroughly oppose imperialism, feudalism, and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. Build our great motherland, defend our great motherland, and defend world peace.

### “五四”青年节宣传提纲

　　“五四”青年节宣传提纲
  “五四运动”是什么？
    三十二年前，一九一九年的五月四日，在北京发生了“五四运动”。这是中国人民伟大的爱国运动，是中国新民主主义革命的开始。
    当时，第一次世界大战刚刚打完，在战争中德国、奥国等帝国主义打败了，获得胜利的英、法、美等帝国主义国家在法国巴黎举行瓜分赃物的“和平会议”。中国在大战时虽然也加入了英、法、美、日这一边和德奥打仗，可是日本帝国主义者在大战期间却乘着卖国贼袁世凯想作皇帝，强迫他承认了灭亡中国的“二十一条件”；又借口山东省有德国租借地，出兵霸占了山东的青岛等地。当时的中国政府的代表在全国人民的压力下，向巴黎“和会”提出要求归还山东特权和否认“二十一条件”，但是，对中国正义的要求，英、法、日、美等帝国主义强盗没有答应。这样一来，就引起了全中国人民的愤怒，爆发了伟大的反帝爱国的示威运动。
    五月四日北京五千多学生举行了一次爱国示威大游行。愤怒的群众痛打了主办对日外交的章宗祥（那时的驻日公使）等人。当时卖国的北京反动政府采取了高压手段，抓了很多学生。全北京、全中国学生都愤怒地抗议、罢课。到六月三日，全国许多城市的工人阶级和商人也参加了这个运动，举行罢工、罢市，群众的声势浩大，如火燎原，这就变成了全国性的伟大爱国主义运动。北京反动政府被迫撤换了曹汝霖（订“二十一条件”时的外交次长，那时当交通总长）、陆宗舆、章宗祥等卖国贼的职务，被迫拒绝在巴黎和约上签字。这个运动震动了全中国，也震动了全世界。
    为什么中国人民当时能举行这样伟大的反帝爱国运动呢？首先，是因为中国民族和中国人民长期受着帝国主义和封建主义的残酷压迫，苦难深重，中国社会内部就埋藏着对革命的极其迫切的要求。在第一次世界大战中，有些帝国主义忙着打仗，不得不暂时放松了对中国的经济侵略，中国民族工商业有了些发展。这个发展，使得中国工人阶级壮大起来。
    “五四运动”是信仰共产主义的知识分子领导的。在“五四运动”前，俄国的十月革命成功，给中国带来了马克思列宁主义的革命真理。伟大的十月革命，使得被压迫的中国人民得到很大的鼓舞，找到了争取解放的道路。“五四运动”就是在伟大的十月革命影响之下发生的。在“五四运动”以后，信仰共产主义的人一天天地多起来了，到一九二一年——就是“五四运动”的两年以后，中国共产党就成立了。从此中国的革命的面貌就为之一新。“五四运动”标志着中国旧民主主义革命时代的结束，新民主主义革命时代的开始。
    “五四运动”充分显示了中国青年的革命精神和伟大力量，所以五月四日被规定为青年节。而中国新民主主义青年团也是在两年前的“五四”诞生的，所以“五四”又是青年团成立纪念日。
  为什么要纪念“五四”青年节？
    “五四”爱国运动的目的，是要彻底打倒压迫中国人民的帝国主义和封建势力，把贫穷落后的中国变成一个独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国。
    三十年来，我们中国人民在毛主席和共产党领导下，经历了无数的牺牲奋斗，终于推翻了帝国主义和它的走狗蒋介石在中国的统治，在一九四九年成立了中华人民共和国，产生了中央人民政府。中国人民从此真正站起来了，并且真正做了国家的主人。一年多以来，我们人民政府完成了许多伟大的任务，造成了中国历史上的奇迹。我们停止了延续十几年的通货膨胀，克服了巨大的灾荒，推进了农工业生产的恢复工作。农业方面，获得了丰收。工业方面，工人阶级以主人翁的自觉的劳动态度，不断地创造了新的纪录，生产品的质量大为提高。在近三亿人口地区完成了土地改革，工农劳动者的生活获得了初步的改善。特别是我们的伟大的抗美援朝运动，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在一起，在中朝两国人民和全世界人民热烈的支援下，打败了穷凶极恶的美帝国主义和许多帮凶国家的军队，最有力地保卫了世界和平事业。我们的祖国已变成从来没有过的那样地可爱了。我们的祖国还要日益变得更强大，更可爱。
    纪念“五四”，就能大大激发我们热爱祖国的崇高感情。
    纪念“五四”，使我们回顾三十二年新民主主义革命的艰难困苦，流血牺牲，就愈能使我们感到胜利果实的可贵，更能使我们积极努力保卫我们的胜利果实。
    纪念“五四”，就能使我们更加仇恨中国人民的敌人，更加仇恨帝国主义者和国民党反动派，也就更能加强我们抗美援朝、保家卫国的决心，加强我们最后消灭国民党反动派和镇压反革命分子的决心。
  怎样纪念“五四”青年节？
    （一）今年纪念“五四”，必须继续普及深入抗美援朝运动。美帝国主义的侵略朝鲜，其主要的目的是进攻中国。我们只有协助朝鲜打败美国侵略者，才能保障自己和平幸福的生活。现在美国和李承晚匪军已被我们消灭了二十多万，抗美援朝已经有了巨大成绩，但美国帝国主义不仅继续霸占台湾，坚持对朝鲜的侵略战争，而且不断轰炸我们东北的城市和乡村的和平人民。因此，还必须继续进行抗美援朝的长期的与艰苦的斗争，还必须给美帝国主义者更沉重的打击，把它彻底打败，才能使他们扩大战争的阴谋破产，使祖国的安全得到进一步保障，并有效地保卫远东和世界和平。
    同时，我们要坚决反对美国武装日本。美国在朝鲜受到失败以后，就更加加紧进行单独和日本订和约、武装日本反动派、复活日本法西斯，企图利用日本作为进攻中国的军事基地，企图利用日本的人力充当进攻中国的炮灰。我们中国人民曾长期遭受日本帝国主义最残酷的侵略和屠杀。我们无数财产被日本帝国主义毁灭了，抢掠去了；千万以上的父母兄弟姊妹被日本帝国主义残杀了；千万个母亲姊妹被侮辱了；难道我们能让美帝国主义重新把日本武装起来再到中国烧杀淫掳吗？这是绝对不能容许的。我们要彻底粉碎美帝国主义武装日本的阴谋。
    我们要坚决拥护世界和平理事会关于要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言，大家都要在宣言上签名。如果美国、英国、法国的政府不赞成缔结五大国和平公约，就会使全世界人民更进一步地看清他们蓄意侵略和战争的丑恶面目，使他们更加孤立起来；并且使全世界人民更要积极起来保卫和平，粉碎帝国主义者的侵略战争的阴谋。
    （二）今年纪念“五四”，必须更加强我们的人民民主专政，我们要坚决镇压反革命。美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮虽然被我们在大陆上打败了，但还留下了一批特务、土匪、恶霸和反动会道门头子。他们有的埋伏在工厂、矿山里，破坏经济建设；有的混进政府机关，偷窃国家机密；有的组织暴乱，烧杀淫掳；有的造谣放毒，扰乱社会治安。比如最近美蒋特务在湖南零陵县放了一把火，烧掉五百多栋房子，使全城十分之一的人无家可归。大家想想，这些特务是多么可恨可恶。最近中央人民政府颁布了“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”，就是专门用来对付反革命的。如果不镇压反革命，我们人民的生命财产就要遭殃。所以我们全国人民应该坚决协助人民政府，彻底肃清反革命残余势力。我们要完成土地改革。旧中国贫穷、落后、衰弱的最重要原因之一，就是因为农民辛勤劳动的收获，大部分被地主剥削去了。要建设工业化的新中国，发展生产，过好日子，就非彻底在经济上消灭地主阶级不可。现在全国已有将近三万万农业人口地区完成了土地改革。我们应拥护人民政府顺利完成全国的土地改革。为了进一步加强我们的人民民主制度，我们还必须开好人民代表会议，更加加强人民内部四个阶级的统一战线，团结得更加紧密。
    （三）我们每个青年应在自己的岗位上积极努力。青年工人和青年农民要参加“爱国主义生产竞赛”，机关青年应做好工作，学校青年应加强学习，宗教青年应积极参加宗教革新运动。每一个青年为了纪念“五四”，都应该进一步提高我们的知识水平和思想水平，把我们每天的成就变成打击美帝国主义和蒋介石反动派的力量，成为保卫祖国和保卫世界和平的力量。现在各地的工厂、农村、机关、学校、街道都在订立爱国公约，这是把反美爱国和我们实际工作联系起来的好办法。凡是还没有订爱国公约的单位应赶快订，已订立了的就应该努力执行。
    一切爱国青年应该紧密地在伟大的爱国主义旗帜下团结起来，在毛主席的英明领导下，继续发扬“五四”以来中国人民的爱国主义精神，彻底反对帝国主义、封建主义和蒋介石反动派。建设我们伟大的祖国，保卫我们伟大的祖国，保卫世界和平。
