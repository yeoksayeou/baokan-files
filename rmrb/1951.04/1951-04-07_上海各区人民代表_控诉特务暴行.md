Shanghai People's Representatives of Various Districts Accuse Special Agents of Atrocities

[This newspaper reports] A mass movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries is unfolding in Shanghai. The people's representative conferences in the thirty districts of the city have all focused on discussing the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Worker and student representatives, neighborhood resident representatives, and representatives of families of martyrs have all used their personal experiences of being persecuted by special agents to accuse the American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents of various criminal activities in factories, schools, and neighborhoods. Through the personal accusations of the representatives, as well as letters of accusation from the masses to the conference during the meeting, everyone has recognized the harm of counter-revolutionary elements, put forward demands for severe suppression of counter-revolutionary elements, and expressed their determination to resolutely implement the Shanghai Military Control Commission's decision on the registration of reactionary party, league, and special agent personnel. Many districts' representatives of all circles have also separately formulated patriotic anti-special agent covenants. Some representatives have even reported on special agent elements who are still continuing to carry out sabotage activities at the meeting.

Over the past year, citizens of the Xincheng District have assisted the government in uncovering 67 counter-revolutionary cases, arresting 461 counter-revolutionary elements, and seizing a considerable number of American-made weapons and radio stations. In the general meeting and group discussions, both the representatives within the conference and the masses outside the conference accused counter-revolutionary elements of their crimes. A group mainly composed of shop assistants was very enthusiastic when discussing the central task of registering reactionary party, league, and special agent personnel, with some speaking six or seven times. Wang Kangnian of the Hardware Store Workers' Union said: "At first, my understanding of special agents was insufficient. I thought the trade union was a mass organization, so what could special agents sabotage? Later, from practical lessons, I realized that special agents harm the interests of everyone." At the general meeting, Lu Meiying, the wife of martyr Zhou Baoxun, went on stage with her orphan to accuse the special agents of how they caused her to lose her husband and her child to lose their father. Zhou Yilong, the father of martyr Zhou, who is a vegetable vendor, also ran onto the stage, crying and complaining, shouting: "The special agents who killed my son must be caught!" Another family member of a martyr, Tian Zhengsheng, witnessed his son being subjected to torture by special agents. The inhuman special agents even threw the broken wooden stick in front of him. When he finished his accusation, he almost fell in front of the microphone, because the special agents had damaged his nerves and heart with electric shocks. During the meeting, residents of the district also constantly sent letters of accusation against the special agents. The son of Ding Guo, a resident of No. 12, Lane 72, Taixing Road, changed his name three times and wandered around because he was followed by special agents before liberation. Ding Guo herself dictated a letter and asked someone to take notes, and brought it to the general meeting to be read out. The Kangsheng Coffee Shop in the district sent a bad check that had been kept all along, which was forcibly left behind by reactionary Kuomintang military officers after feasting and drinking. A resident who used to live in the 16th Pupu area and was injured by American-Chiang Kai-shek aircraft bombing after being targeted by special agents also wrote a letter to the general meeting to accuse them.

Through the accusations of the families of martyrs or suffering people who were harmed by Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and after group discussions, the people's hatred for special agents was aroused. Everyone felt that the special agents were too hateful and that they must return to carry out propaganda on the registration of reactionary parties and leagues, and guarantee to assist the people's government in doing a good job in the current registration of reactionary party, league, and special agent personnel. Many districts have also formulated anti-special agent patriotic covenants. Yu Qiongying and Xiao Bonian, representatives of residents of Jing'an District, used their dinner time to discuss and draft an anti-special agent covenant. Worker representatives proposed: to strengthen workers' organizations, strengthen workers' pickets, protect factories, and prevent sabotage by special agents. Neighborhood resident representatives and representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors said: do not listen to special agent rumors, do not hide special agents, and report special agents to the people's government at any time. Representatives from the cultural and educational sectors stated: be prepared to carry out propaganda and education work against American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents at any time. A student from Yucai Middle School in Xincheng District reported on his father, who had done many evil deeds, lived a corrupt life, and had served as a section chief in the puppet police bureau, on the spot. A woman from a neighborhood specifically went to Nanjing to persuade her husband, who was a special agent, to register.

　　上海各区人民代表控诉特务暴行
    【本报讯】镇压反革命的群众性运动，正在上海展开。该市市区三十个区的各界人民代表会议，都着重地讨论了镇压反革命问题。工人学生、里弄居民代表及烈士家属代表，都以亲身遭受特务迫害的事实，在会上控诉了美蒋特务在工厂、学校、里弄内的各种罪恶活动。通过代表的亲身控诉，以及会议期中群众向大会的投函控诉，大家认识到反革命分子的危害，提出严厉镇压反革命分子的要求，并表示要坚决贯彻市军事管制委员会对反动党、团、特务人员登记的决定，不少区的各界代表还分别订出了爱国反特务公约。有的代表在会上检举了还在继续进行破坏活动的特务分子。
    新成区市民一年来协助政府破获了六十七件反革命案件，逮捕反革命分子四百六十一名，缴获了不少美造武器、电台。在大会和小组讨论中，会内代表与会外群众都控诉了反革命分子的罪行。一个大部分是店员的小组，当讨论到反动党团特务登记的中心工作时，情绪非常高涨，有的发言六七次。五金店员工会王康年说：“最初我对特务认识不够，以为工会是群众团体，特务破坏啥？后来从实际的教训中，知道特务是危害每一个人的利益的。”大会上，烈士周宝训的妻子陆美英，带着孤儿走上台去，控诉特务如何使她失去了丈夫，使孩子失去了爸爸。周烈士的父亲周沂龙是菜贩，也跑上台，一面痛哭，一面伸诉，高喊着：“杀我儿子的特务，一定要捉牢伊！”另一个烈属田正生，他目击他儿子受着特务的酷刑，失去人性的特务还把打断的木棍投到他面前。当他控诉完的时候，几乎跌倒在扩音机送话器前，因为特务曾用电刑损坏了他的神经和心脏。会议进行中间，该区居民对特务的控诉信也不断送来。泰兴路七十二弄十二号居民丁郭氏的儿子，解放前因被特务跟踪，三次更名换姓，到处流浪。丁郭氏自己口讲请人笔记了一封信，带到大会宣读。区内康生咖啡店送来一张一直保留着的国民党反动军官大吃大喝之后，强迫丢下的空头支票。一个从前住在十六铺被特务指示目标，美蒋飞机轰炸受伤而迁居该区的居民，也写信给大会控诉。
    通过了被蒋匪残害的烈士或苦难的人民的家属的控诉，再经过小组讨论，激起了人民对特务的仇恨。大家都觉得特务太可恶，必须回去进行反动党、团登记的宣传，并保证协助人民政府作好当前对于反动党、团、特务人员的登记工作。不少区还订出了反特务爱国公约。静安区居民代表俞琼瑛、萧伯年利用吃晚饭时间，商量起草反特务公约。工人代表提出：要加强工人组织，壮大工人纠察队，保护工厂，防止特务破坏。里弄居民代表及工商界代表说：不听信特务谣言，不隐藏特务，随时向人民政府检举特务。文教界代表表示：随时作好反对美蒋特务的宣传教育工作。新成区育才中学一个学生当场检举出他的作恶多端，生活腐化，当过伪警察局处长的父亲。里弄居民中一个妇女专程跑到南京去动员他的作特务的丈夫去登记。
