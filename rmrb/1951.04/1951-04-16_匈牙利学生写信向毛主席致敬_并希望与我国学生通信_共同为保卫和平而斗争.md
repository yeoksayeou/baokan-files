Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: Our embassy in Hungary has successively received many enthusiastic letters from Hungarian students paying their respects to Chairman Mao and addressed to Chinese students. The entire second grade, class B, of the Donbovar City Normal School in Hungary wrote in their letter of respect to Chairman Mao: "We have watched the heroic liberation struggle of the Chinese people with great enthusiasm. Now we are watching the liberation struggle of the Korean people in the same way, and its victory mostly relies on the bravery and determination of the Chinese People's Volunteers. We thank you, Comrade Mao Zedong, for the great cause of workers all over the world and for fighting for peace." In their letter to the Chinese normal school students, they wrote: "Your struggle is our struggle. We urge you to fight for our common cause—peace—with the weapons of knowledge."

A young pioneer from a middle school in Budapest wrote to Chinese students and said: "Although we are far away, our will is one. No force can defeat this will." Yeva, a student in the Mao Zedong Class at a middle school in Budapest, said: "To express our sincere friendship, our eighth class has been named the Mao Zedong Class. We hope to hear news about the great Chinese people often. Correspondence will increase our understanding and friendship."

Hungarian students drew beautiful pictures on their stationery and sent some exquisite Hungarian pictures. Student Chelezhi wrote in his letter: Although our country is much smaller than China, our country is also a beautiful country. We hope you will also send pictures of China.

    【新华社十四日讯】我国驻匈牙利大使馆曾陆续收到匈牙利学生向毛主席致敬及寄给中国学生的许多热情的信。匈牙利顿巴瓦尔城师范学校二年级乙班全体学生在给毛主席的致敬信中写道：“我们曾满怀热情地注视着英勇的中国人民的解放斗争。现在我们同样地注视着朝鲜人民的解放斗争，它的胜利大部分靠了中国人民志愿军的英勇和坚决。我们对您，为全世界劳动者的伟大事业、为和平而斗争的毛泽东同志致谢。”他们在给中国师范学生的信中写道：“你们的战斗就是我们的战斗。我们吁请你们用学识的武器为我们的共同事业——和平而斗争”。
    布达佩斯中学的一个女少先队员写信给中国学生说：“虽然我们距离很远，但我们的意志是一个。任何力量也战胜不了这种意志。”布达佩斯中学毛泽东班的学生耶娃说：“为了表示我们的衷诚的友谊，我们第八班已命名为毛泽东班。我们希望经常听到关于伟大的中国人民的消息。通信将增进我们的了解和友爱。”
    匈牙利学生在他们的信笺上绘上美丽的图画，并寄来一些精美的匈牙利图片。学生切列芝在信中写道：虽然我们的祖国比中国小得多，但我们的祖国也是美丽的国家。我们希望你们也寄来中国的图片。
