More than a Thousand Townships Have Completed Land Reform

　　The land reform and rent reduction movement in the Northwest region is being carried out according to the plan adopted by the Second Meeting of the Northwest Military and Political Committee last July. Land reform in 3,017 townships, covering 7.3 million people in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia provinces and the suburbs of Xi'an, began in August last year and unfolded universally by November. Each province, based on its specific situation, was divided into one or two or three phases to carry out the work. As of now, a total of 1,095 townships have completed land reform, accounting for more than one-third of all land reform areas, including 868 townships in the Guanzhong area and Yulin Special District of Shaanxi Province, 171 townships in the Qingyang Special District of Gansu Province, 51 townships in Ningxia Province's Ningshuo and Yanchi counties, and five townships in the suburbs of Xi'an. The remaining 1,922 townships, mainly in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, can have their land reform work completed before the summer harvest (mid-May), because Guanzhong is a wheat-producing area, and land reform work can be combined with weeding wheat and planting cotton. Based on the degree of mass mobilization in the villages that have completed land reform, about 20-30 percent have done a good job, about 10 percent have done a very poor job, and about 60-70 percent are in an intermediate state. This means that mass mobilization is not sufficient in many places, and most cadres still have the style of doing everything for the masses and formalism. In places where mass mobilization has not been done well, it is necessary to continue to do a good job of mass work in the future development of the production movement.

Rent Reduction Movement Launched in Areas with More Than Ten Million People

　　In areas of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces where land reform has not yet been implemented, a rent reduction movement has been launched on the basis of mobilizing the masses to clear bandits, counter-spies, and oppose local tyrants. These areas include all of southern Shaanxi, most of Gansu and Ningxia, and five counties and one city in Qinghai Province, totaling more than 12 million people. In Qinghai, southern Shaanxi, and other places, the rent reduction movement has been universally launched, and it is necessary to continue to deeply mobilize the masses, consolidate the victory, and then seek expansion. Gansu, Ningxia, and other places are also carrying out rent reduction work, but there are still some areas that remain in the pilot stage in a few villages. The circle is too small to open up the situation, and it is necessary to let go of mobilizing the masses and universally carry out the rent reduction struggle. Rent reduction work can not only be done now, but also after the spring ploughing, it can still be done by taking advantage of production gaps or in combination with production, until it connects with this winter's land reform. In order to prepare for the universal launch of the rent reduction movement this winter, Xinjiang Province has now conducted trials in individual villages in more than 50 counties, which is necessary.

　　Overall, the land reform and rent reduction movement in the Northwest region is steady in its steps, cadres are cautious in implementing policies, the work is diligent, and great achievements have been made. Through rent reduction and land reform, the people have a deeper understanding of the evils of the rural feudal exploitation system. In the past, the rule of landlords and local tyrants in the countryside was truly dark and hopeless. They plundered property, raped women, killed people, and committed all kinds of evil. After liberation, the masses still did not dare to look up, did not dare to tell the truth, had great concerns, and some even did not dare to rise up to struggle, did not dare to join the peasant associations, and did not dare to take things when they were distributed. Judging from the above situation, the authority and influence of landlords and local tyrants in the countryside greatly exceeded the imagination of ordinary people. If they are not overthrown first, the broad masses cannot be mobilized. The personal experiences told by millions of peasants in grievance meetings and reasoning meetings fully illustrate that the poverty and backwardness of the countryside are due to the fact that the fruits of labor and production of the vast number of peasants are exploited by a small number of the landlord class. The landlord class will never be reconciled to its own demise. Although the Land Reform Law has been promulgated and widely publicized, the transfer of property and other destructive activities are still extremely common, and even use rumors, threats, conspiracy, and assassination to organize bandits to disrupt the land reform work. Therefore, in carrying out rent reduction and land reform, it is necessary to carry out arduous mass work and mobilize the broad masses of peasants to carry out the struggle in order to achieve victory. And the victory of rent reduction and land reform will inevitably bring great political and economic benefits to the peasants. According to the statistics of 448 townships in the first phase of land reform in Guanzhong, more than 400,900 mu of land were distributed, and the average amount of land owned by poor and hired peasants is equivalent to about 75 percent of the average number per capita. More than 60,000 households have also been distributed with agricultural tools, houses, and food. Local tyrants, bandits, and illegal landlords have been punished. Peasant associations, militia, and youth and women's organizations have been developed. The rural government has been transformed. The peasants have truly become the masters. Rumors have disappeared. Society is stable. The masses' enthusiasm for production is high. The prestige of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government among the peasants has been unprecedentedly enhanced. In the five rent reduction pilot townships in Qinghai Province, 1,228 peasant households reduced more than 1,700 dan of grain from the landlords. After the victory of rent reduction, the masses enthusiastically paid public grain. Fathers sent their sons to join the People's Liberation Army. Several thousand people in Xining City and Minhe County attended winter school. The unity of all ethnic groups has been strengthened. These moving examples all show that carrying out rent reduction and land reform in rural areas will be warmly supported by the broad masses of all ethnic groups. We firmly believe that as long as we constantly correct the shortcomings in our work and work more actively, we will achieve even greater results.

Five Major Experiences in the Mass Movement

　　The rich experience created in the mass movement must be summarized in order to improve cadres and promote work. There are mainly the following five points:

　　(1) Eliminating the feudal exploitation system in the new rural areas is a systematic and fierce struggle. This struggle has already begun since the day of liberation. It has gone through the intermediate stages of suppressing bandits, countering spies, opposing local tyrants, reducing rent, and land reform, all of which are the interconnected development process of mobilizing the masses to carry out the anti-feudal struggle. The practice of closely linking these mass struggles is correct; the practice of separating them from each other is wrong. The correct practice is to mobilize the masses in doing a good job of suppressing bandits, countering spies, opposing local tyrants, reducing rent, and other work, and then enter land reform, rather than waiting until land reform to mobilize the masses. In the current land reform areas, the villages that have paid attention to and done mass mobilization work before are very smooth, and it can be completed in about 40 to 50 days; while the villages that have paid little attention to doing mass mobilization work before will encounter many difficulties, often taking a long time and still not doing well. This is the reason.

　　(2) Mobilizing the masses is to raise the class consciousness of the broad masses of peasants. It is necessary to make every village and every household of peasants fully understand that today workers, peasants, and all other working people are no longer slaves of society, but will forever be the masters of society. The working people must mobilize and organize themselves to fight for the elimination of the feudal exploitation system and the creation of their own free and happy lives. The strength of the class-conscious and united working people is the fundamental force for carrying out all democratic reforms and building a new society, which can never be done by any small number of cadres. In order to raise the class consciousness of the broad masses of peasants, a lot of work needs to be done: it is necessary to hold good peasant representative meetings at the county, district, and township levels. The content of the meetings should be combined with the things that the masses are most concerned about and familiar with, and explain the policies and decrees of the People's Government to the masses; it is necessary to help the peasant masses organize themselves, rectify the peasant associations, expand the organization, and absorb the vast majority of adult male and female peasants and poor rural intellectuals and other working people among the poor, hired, and middle peasants; it is necessary to lead the development of the struggle against the landlord class, and adopt a combination of reasoning struggle and court judgment. In general, more small-scale reasoning meetings and grievance meetings should be held. Large mass meetings are also necessary, but small-scale reasoning meetings or grievance meetings must be held before and after the large meetings, so that the combination of large and small meetings will play a greater role. Because large meetings can unify calls to action, create momentum, and open up the situation; small meetings can deeply mobilize, concretely publicize, and organize the masses to take action. Facts have proved that this experience created by the masses themselves is very good. For evil landlords or illegal landlords who have committed serious crimes and are hated by the masses, peasants should be advised not to adopt methods of torture to extract confessions, but to adopt the method of reasoning meetings and judgments by the People's Court to give them severe suppression. In the struggle, the guns of landlords and rich peasants should be confiscated, and at the same time, militia should be organized to do a good job of local security and protect the interests of the peasant masses. It is necessary to talk about strategy in the struggle. The size and number of crimes of the landlord class, historical crimes and current crimes, lawbreakers and law-abiding people must be treated differently. It is wrong not to distinguish them. It is necessary to pay close attention to cultivating activists among the masses and rely on them to improve and transform the rural government and establish and strengthen local militia organizations in order to consolidate the fruits of the masses' victory. The above series of tasks must be handed over to the masses themselves on the basis of raising the class consciousness of the peasants. Any practice of doing everything for the masses is wrong.

　　(3) It is necessary to establish a broad united front against feudalism in the countryside. Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his report on the land reform issue that the general line of land reform is "to rely on poor peasants and hired peasants, unite middle peasants, neutralize rich peasants, and eliminate the feudal exploitation system step by step and with distinctions, and develop agricultural production." This is a complete line that cannot be divided. Not focusing on mobilizing poor peasants and hired peasants, or only mobilizing poor peasants and hired peasants without paying attention to uniting middle peasants, or not paying attention to uniting other anti-feudal elements in the countryside, or not seriously treating the issue of neutralizing rich peasants, are all incomplete implementation of the general line of land reform, and all have shortcomings or errors. In order to rely on poor peasants and hired peasants, it is necessary to do more work for them and cultivate activists among poor and hired peasants. In the peasant association committees and peasant representative meetings, it is necessary to ensure that poor peasants and hired peasants have more than half of the representatives participating, and give play to their backbone role in the struggle for rent reduction and land reform, and meet their actual needs as much as possible. When mobilizing poor peasants and hired peasants, it is necessary to consolidate the unity of middle peasants. In the peasant association committees and peasant representative meetings, middle peasants should have more than one-third of the representatives. In the struggle against the landlord class by poor, hired, and middle peasants united together, it is necessary to ensure that the interests of middle peasants are not harmed in the slightest, and to make as many middle peasants feel that they have indeed gained benefits. It should be known that if poor peasants and hired peasants are not fully mobilized to form a backbone, it is impossible to unite all the rural working people to launch a struggle; without the unity of all peasants, there is no backbone role for poor peasants and hired peasants. Revolutionary intellectuals in the countryside, such as primary school teachers, must be absorbed to participate in the rent reduction and land reform movement, so that they can also be tempered in the common struggle with the peasants. Other working people in the countryside, such as handicraft workers, must be absorbed to participate in the movement. It is necessary to unite the enlightened gentry in the countryside. The issue of neutral rich peasants must be taken seriously. The boundary between landlords and rich peasants should be carefully divided so that there are no mistakes. In short, in the anti-feudal struggle in the countryside, poor peasants and hired peasants are the backbone, and the consolidated unity of poor, hired, and middle peasants is the basic team. In order to defeat the enemy, it is necessary to unite all possible anti-feudal forces and neutralize all people who can be neutralized. These issues must be clearly understood in the minds of cadres and in leading the struggle of the masses.

　　(4) It is necessary to strive for the cooperation of all parties, especially to widely explain the necessity and righteousness of the anti-feudal struggle in the countryside to workers, students, staff, the industrial and commercial sectors, and various democratic parties in the cities, so that they can understand and sympathize with the peasants and help the peasants. Since the anti-feudal struggle in the countryside was launched, many friends in the cities, because they are not close to the peasants in the countryside and have no acquaintances, but they have a group of acquaintances from landlord families or close to landlord families, these people often say bad things about the peasant movement in the countryside. Because they listened to one side of the story and did not understand the truth, they had many doubts. The Northwest Military and Political Committee once organized various democratic parties and some democrats to go to the countryside to participate in and visit the actual peasant movement. These democrats made a group of peasant friends, listened to their words, and established feelings with them. Many problems were naturally solved. They became more convinced that the feudal exploitation system was extremely dark and extremely unreasonable and must be thoroughly reformed, and they were also able to put forward correct opinions on the shortcomings existing in the mass movement. This is a successful experience, and provinces, cities, and counties can follow this example. Many intellectuals are from landlord families. Our policy towards intellectuals is very clear, which is the policy of unity and transformation. All intellectuals must study well, eliminate the old influence, establish new ideas, actively participate in and support the revolutionary struggle of the working people, and serve the working people in order to play their role and have a bright future.

　　(5) Strengthen leadership. The most important thing is to do the following things well: First, organize and mobilize a large number of cadres to work in the countryside. At present, there are more than 20,000 staff members in the rent reduction and land reform movement in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces, which is a decisive factor in achieving great achievements. In the future, we should continue to pay attention to reducing the unimportant tasks of the organs, simplifying the handling procedures, improving work efficiency, transferring personnel to participate in the land reform and rent reduction movement, and greatly promote the practice of various departments combining their own business and sending cadres to work in the countryside in rotation. This not only strengthens the current mass movement, but also is a very good way to practically educate cadres. Second, master the working method of using key villages to drive the surrounding villages. Each county should select several key points, which should be personally controlled by leading cadres, and at the same time closely guide the surrounding villages, and summarize the experience at any time and promote it. The role of key villages lies entirely in driving the mass movement in the surrounding villages, and spreading to the surrounding villages in a wave-like manner; and the leading role of key villages must be maintained for a long time. Third, send strong cadres to inspect and check the work, discover problems and solve problems at any time, and exchange experiences. Whenever and wherever there is a deviation, cadres should be sent there immediately to correct it. Whenever and wherever there is a good example, cadres should be sent there immediately to help summarize it, organize it, promote it, and guide the work. Fourth, be good at using slack farming and work gaps, and adopt the method of summarizing work to organize cadres to conduct rectification and study. In this way, cadres can continuously improve and make the work more solid.

　　After exchanging views with comrades working in various places, everyone agreed that the land reform of all agricultural areas in the Northwest should be universally completed in the next two or three years. The steps are: This winter and next spring, in the Han areas of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces that have not undergone land reform, and in some agricultural areas where ethnic minorities live together (a total of about 12 million people), land reform will be carried out on the basis of deepening the rent reduction movement this year. In other agricultural areas where ethnic minorities live together or where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, and in the entire Xinjiang, a universal rent reduction movement will be launched. Strive to carry out land reform in the winter of next year and the spring of the year after. Completing this historical task is of extremely great significance, not only to pave the way for the development of agricultural production and the development of the industrial economy, but also to lay a solid foundation for consolidating the people's democratic regime and strengthening the unity of the people of all ethnic groups.

　　The land reform this winter and next spring will have more favorable conditions than the current land reform movement. This is not only because there is a more stable social order and rich practical work experience, but the most important thing is that there is still half a year to actively carry out the movement to clear bandits, counter spies, oppose local tyrants, reduce rent, produce, and resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and do a good job of mobilizing the masses. This is to prepare for land reform, and it is also a decisive condition to ensure the successful completion of land reform. This condition needs us to strive for and create. In the early days of liberation, we repeatedly emphasized that the steps should be steady and not suffer from acute illness, because at that time there were no conditions for realizing land reform. If we tried to do it reluctantly, we would commit the mistake of adventurism. It was completely right to say that at that time. Today, the situation has changed. The mass movement has advanced, and there are conditions for carrying out land reform, or it is possible to strive for and create conditions for carrying out land reform. We must actively strive for and create such conditions and seize the opportunity to carry out land reform. This is not adventure, but doing things according to conditions. In this way, the steps are still steady. On the contrary, if we do not see the changes in today's environment, do not see the progress of the masses, and are tied up and passively wait, then we will suffer from chronic illness. This is what should be paid attention to today.

　　Local experiences in agricultural areas where various ethnic groups live together or where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities have proved that countering spies, opposing local tyrants, and reducing rent can be carried out. Land reform, it should be said, can also be carried out. What must be noted is that the steps should be steady, the leadership should be by cadres of their own ethnic group, the masses of their own ethnic group should be the main force, unite the people of other ethnic groups, and unite and neutralize all people who can be united and neutralized, and isolate the enemy. In this way, we can be victorious. In land reform, the land of mosques and Lama temples may be retained as appropriate with the consent of the masses of their own ethnic groups. This is clearly stipulated in the Land Reform Law and should be resolutely implemented.

　　为继续开展土地改革运动而斗争
    ——西北军政委员会习仲勋副主席在西北军政委员会
    第三次会议上的报告，关于减租和土地改革部分。
    千余乡已经完成土地改革
    西北地区土地改革和减租运动，是按照去年七月西北军政委员会第二次会议所通过的计划进行的。陕西、甘肃、宁夏三省内及西安市郊三千零十七个乡共七百三十万人口地区的土地改革，从去年八月开始，到十一月普遍展开。各省依具体情况，分为一期或两、三期进行。截至目前止，完成土地改革的共有一千零九十五个乡，占全部土地改革地区三分之一强，计陕西省关中地区及榆林专区八百六十八乡，甘肃省庆阳专区一百七十一乡，宁夏省宁朔、盐池两县五十一乡，西安市郊五个乡。其余一千九百二十二乡，主要在陕西省关中地区，这些乡村的土地改革工作可于夏收前（五月中）结束，因为关中是产麦区，土地改革工作可以和锄麦、种棉结合进行。已完成土地改革的乡村，依发动群众的程度看，做得好的，约占百分之二、三十，做得很差的，占百分之十左右，中间状态的，占百分之六、七十。这就是说，不少地方发动群众还不充分，多数干部还存在着包办代替和形式主义作风。凡发动群众工作尚未做好的地方，必须在今后开展生产运动中，继续做好群众工作。
  千余万人口地区展开减租运动
    在陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海四省尚未实行土地改革的地区，在发动群众进行清剿土匪、反特务、反恶霸的基础上，已开展减租运动。这些地区包括陕南全部，甘肃、宁夏大部，青海省的五县一市，共一千二百余万人口。青海、陕南等地，减租运动已经普遍展开，需要继续深入发动群众，巩固胜利，再求扩展。甘肃、宁夏等地也正在开展减租工作，但还有一些地区，停留在少数乡村的试办阶段，圈子太小，打不开局面，必须放手发动群众，把减租斗争普遍开展起来。减租工作，不仅目前可以做，到春耕以后，仍然可以利用生产间隙或结合生产去作，一直到衔接上今冬的土地改革。新疆省为了准备今冬普遍开展减租运动，现在已有五十多县分别在个别乡村内进行试办，这是必要的。
    总起来看，西北地区的土地改革和减租运动，步骤是稳当的，干部执行政策是谨慎的，工作是努力的，已有很大的成绩。经过减租和土地改革，人民对于农村封建剥削制度的罪恶，认识得更深刻了。过去农村中地主恶霸的统治，真是暗无天日，他们掠夺财产，奸淫妇女，杀害人命，无恶不作。解放了，群众仍然不敢抬头，不敢讲真话，顾虑很大，有的甚至不敢起来斗争，不敢参加农民协会，分东西不敢要。从上述情况来看，农村中地主恶霸的权威之大，影响之深，大大超过一般人的想像，如不先将他们打倒，就不能把广大群众发动起来。各地诉苦会、说理会中，千百万农民所诉说的亲身经历，充分地说明了农村的贫困和落后，是由于广大农民劳动生产的果实，被地主阶级少数人所榨取去的缘故。地主阶级绝不甘心于自己的灭亡，虽然土地改革法早经公布，并作了广泛宣传，但他们转移财物及进行其他各种破坏活动，仍极为普遍，甚至用造谣威胁，阴谋暗害，组织土匪捣乱来破坏土地改革工作。所以，在进行减租和土地改革时，必须进行艰苦的群众工作，发动广大农民进行斗争，才能获得胜利。而减租和土地改革的胜利，必然使农民获得极大的政治的和经济的利益。关中第一期土地改革，据四百四十八乡的统计，分配土地四十万零九千余亩，贫、雇农民平均占有土地数已相当于按全人口平均数的百分之七十五左右，并有六万余户分得农具、房屋和粮食等，惩办了恶霸、土匪和不法地主，发展了农民协会、民兵及青年、妇女组织，乡村政权获得改造，农民真正当了主人，谣言绝迹，社会安定，群众生产情绪高涨，毛主席、共产党和人民政府在农民中的威信空前提高。青海省五个减租试办乡，一千二百二十八户农民，从地主手中减回多交租谷一千七百余石。减租胜利后，群众踊跃缴纳公粮，父亲送儿子参加人民解放军，西宁市、民和县都有几千人上冬学，各族人民更加团结。这些动人的事例，都说明了在农村中进行减租和土地改革，是会获得各族广大人民的热烈拥护。我们深信，只要不断改正工作中的缺点，更加积极努力，我们还要获得更大的成绩。
  群众运动中的五条主要经验
    群众运动中，已创造出的丰富经验，必须加以总结，以提高干部，推动工作。这主要有以下五条：
    （一）在新区农村中消灭封建剥削制度，是一场系统的激烈的斗争。这个斗争，从解放之日起，就已经开始了，中间经过剿匪、反特务、反恶霸、减租直到土地改革，都是发动群众开展反封建斗争的互相衔接的发展过程。将这些群众斗争，紧密地联结起来的做法，是正确的；将它们互相割裂开来的做法，是错误的。正确的做法是在做好剿匪、反特务、反恶霸、减租等工作中，发动了群众，进入土地改革，而不是等到土地改革时，才去发动群众。在目前土地改革地区，凡以前注意了并做了发动群众工作的乡村，工作就很顺利，大约四五十天时间，即可做完；而以前很少注意做发动群众工作的乡村，就碰到很多困难，往往时间拖得很长，还做不好，就是这个道理。
    （二）发动群众，就是要提高广大农民的阶级觉悟。要使每村、每户的农民群众，都充分明了：今天工人、农民及其他一切劳动人民，不再是社会的奴隶，而永远是社会的主人了，劳动人民要动员起来，组织起来，为消灭封建剥削制度，和创造自己的自由幸福的生活而斗争。有了阶级觉悟的和团结起来的劳动人民的力量，是进行一切民主改革和建设新社会的根本力量，绝不是任何少数干部所能包办代替的。为了提高广大农民的阶级觉悟，需要做很多工作：要开好县、区、乡的农民代表会议，会议的内容应结合群众最关心和最熟悉的事情，向群众说明人民政府的政策和法令；要帮助农民群众组织起来，整顿农民协会，扩大组织，吸收贫、雇、中农中的绝大多数成年男女农民及农村贫苦知识分子和其他劳动人民参加；要有领导地开展反对地主阶级的斗争，采取说理斗争与法庭判处相结合的方式，一般的多开小型的说理会，诉苦会，大的群众会议也有必要，但是，大会前后必须配合召开小型说理会或诉苦会，使大会和小会相结合，这样就会发挥更大的作用。因为大会可以统一号召，造成声势，推开局面；小会可以深入动员，具体宣传，组织群众行动起来。事实证明群众自己创造出来的这种经验是很好的。对有重大罪行、群众痛恨的恶霸地主或不法地主，劝告农民不采取非刑拷打的办法，而采取说理会和经过人民法庭判决的方式，给以严厉的镇压。在斗争中，地主、富农的枪支均应收缴，同时应组织民兵，做好地方治安工作，保护农民群众的利益。斗争中讲策略，是必要的，对于地主阶级中罪行的大小、多少，历史罪与现行罪，违法者与守法者，必须加以区别对待，不加区别，是不对的。要十分注意培养群众中的积极分子，依靠他们去健全和改造乡村政权，建立和加强地方民兵组织，以巩固群众的胜利果实。上述这一系列的工作，都要在提高农民阶级觉悟的基础上，交给群众自己去做，任何包办代替的做法，都是不对的。
    （三）必须建立广泛的农村反封建的统一战线。刘少奇副主席在关于土地改革问题的报告中，指出土地改革的总路线，是“依靠贫农、雇农、团结中农、中立富农，有步骤地有分别地消灭封建剥削制度，发展农业生产”。这是一条完整的路线，不能加以割裂。不着重发动贫、雇农，或只发动贫、雇农而不重视团结中农，或不注意联合农村中其他反封建分子，不认真对待中立富农问题，都是不完全地执行土地改革的总路线，都是有缺点或错误的。为要依靠贫、雇农，就要向他们多做工作，培养贫、雇农民中的积极分子。在农民协会委员会和农民代表会议中，要保证贫、雇农民有半数以上的代表参加，并在减租和土地改革斗争中，发挥他们的骨干作用，尽可能地满足他们的实际要求。在发动贫、雇农时，要巩固地团结中农，在农民协会委员会和农民代表会议中，中农要有三分之一以上的代表。在贫、雇、中农团结一起，去开展反对地主阶级的斗争中，要保证丝毫不损害中农的利益，并尽可能地使很多中农感觉出他们确实获得了利益。要知道，如果没有把贫、雇农充分发动起来，形成骨干，便不可能团结全体农村劳动人民展开斗争；如果没有全体农民的团结，便没有贫、雇农的骨干作用。农村中的革命知识分子，如小学教师等，必须吸收他们参加到减租和土地改革运动中来，也使他们在和农民共同斗争中得到锻炼。农村中的其他劳动人民，如手工业工人等，必须吸收参加运动。对农村中的开明士绅，必须团结。中立富农问题，必须认真对待，应仔细划分地主与富农的界线，勿使有错。总之：农村反封建斗争中，贫、雇农民是骨干，贫、雇、中农的巩固团结是基本队伍，为了打倒敌人，必须联合一切可能联合的反封建力量，中立一切可能中立的人们。这些问题，必须在干部思想中，在领导群众斗争中，明确认识。
    （四）要争取各方面的配合，特别是要在城市的工人、学生、职员、工商业界及各民主党派中，广泛解释农村反封建斗争的必要性与正义性，使他们了解和同情农民并帮助农民。自农村反封建斗争开展以后，城市里边有许多朋友，因为和乡下农民不接近，也没有熟人，但是他们却有一批地主家庭或接近地主家庭的熟人，这些人常说乡下农民运动的坏话，由于他们听了一面话，不明白真相，有了很多疑虑。西北军政委员会曾经组织了各民主党派和一些民主人士，到乡下去，参加和参观了实际的农民运动，这些民主人士交了一批农民朋友，听一听他们的话，和他们建立了感情，很多问题，都自然而然地获得解决，他们更加确信封建剥削制度的极端黑暗、极不合理，必须彻底改革，对群众运动中存在的缺点，也能够提出正确意见来了。这是个成功的经验，各省、市、县都可照此去办。知识分子，有不少是地主家庭出身的。我们对知识分子的政策，是十分明确的，是团结改造的政策。一切知识分子，都必须很好地学习，扫除旧影响，建立新思想，积极参加和拥护劳动人民的革命斗争，为劳动人民服务，才能发挥自己的作用，才能有光明的前途。
    （五）加强领导。最重要的，是必须做好以下几件事：第一，组织和动员大量的干部下乡工作，目前，陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海各省投入减租、土地改革运动中的工作人员，在两万以上，这是取得伟大成绩的决定因素。今后，要继续注意缩减机关不急之务，简化办事手续，提高工作效率，抽调人员参加土地改革和减租运动，并大大提倡各部门结合本身业务，派干部轮流下乡工作。这样做，不但加强了当前进行的群众运动的力量，而且也是实际教育干部的很好办法。第二，掌握经过重点乡村带动周围乡村的工作方法。每县均应选择几处重点，由领导干部亲自掌握，同时密切指导周围各乡，随时总结经验，加以推广。重点乡村的作用，全在于带动周围乡村的群众运动，要向周围乡村作波浪式扩展；而重点乡村的带头作用，则必须长期保持之。第三，派强的干部巡视和检查工作，随时发现问题，解决问题，交流经验。何时、何地发生了偏向，就即时派干部到那里去纠正。何时、何地出现了好的范例，就即时派干部到那里帮助总结，加以条理化，推广出去，指导工作。第四，善于利用农闲和工作间隙，采取总结工作的方法，组织干部进行整风学习。这样干部就能够不断提高，并使工作做一步巩固一步。
    经与各地工作同志交换意见的结果，大家同意，在今后两三年内，普遍完成西北全部农业地区的土地改革。其步骤是：今冬明春，在陕西，甘肃、宁夏、青海四省未经土地改革的汉族地区，及部分民族杂居的农业地区（共约一千二百余万人口）在今年深入减租运动的基础上，进行土地改革，其他不能进行土地改革的民族杂居或少数民族聚居的农业地区，及新疆全部，则普遍开展减租运动。争取在明年冬季和后年春季，进行土地改革。完成这个历史任务，有极其重大的意义，不仅是为发展农业生产与发展工业经济开辟了道路，而且是为巩固人民民主政权，为加强各族人民的团结，打下坚实的基础。
    今冬明春的土地改革，将获得比目前的土地改革运动更加顺利的条件，这不仅因为有了更加安定的社会秩序，有了丰富的实际工作经验，而最主要的是尚有半年的时间，可以去积极进行清剿土匪、反特务、反恶霸、减租、生产和抗美援朝运动，做好发动群众工作。这就是给土地改革做好准备，也是保证土地改革胜利完成的决定条件。这个条件，需要我们去争取、去创造。在解放初期，我们曾再三强调，脚步要稳，不要害急性病，因为当时尚无实现土地改革的条件，勉强去做，就要犯冒险主义的错误，那时候那样讲，是完全对的。今天情况已经有了变化，群众运动前进了，有了进行土地改革的条件，或者是有可能去争取和创造进行土地改革的条件，就必须去积极争取和创造这种条件，抓紧进行土地改革，这不是冒险，是按条件办事，这样做脚步还是稳当的。相反，如果看不见今天环境的变化，看不见群众的进步，束手束脚，消极等待，那就是害了慢性病。这是今天应当提起注意的。
    各族杂居或少数民族聚居的农业地区，各地经验都证明：反特务、反恶霸和减租，是可以进行的。土地改革，应该说，也是可以进行的。必须注意的是：步骤要稳，要由本民族干部去领导，以本民族群众为主，团结其他各族人民，联合和中立一切可能联合和中立的人们，孤立敌人，这样是能够胜利的。在土地改革中，清真寺和喇嘛寺的土地，在本民族群众的同意下，得酌予保留，这是土地改革法明确规定，应当坚决执行的。
