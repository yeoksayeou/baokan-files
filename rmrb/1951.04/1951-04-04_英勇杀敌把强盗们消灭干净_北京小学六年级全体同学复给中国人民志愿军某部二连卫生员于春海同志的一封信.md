　　Heroically Kill the Enemy and Wipe Out the Bandits
　　-- A Letter from All Sixth-Grade Students of Beijing Elementary School to Comrade Yu Chunhai, Medical Orderly of the Second Company of a Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

Respected Uncle Yu Chunhai:

　　We saw your letter in the People's Daily on March 23rd. Your letter fully expressed your care and love for us. How happy and grateful we are!

　　We are students at an elementary school for children of cadres in the people's capital. Under the guidance of our teachers, we study hard and have organized various extracurricular activity groups, such as the waist drum team, dance group, and acrobatics team. Our lives are truly indescribably fulfilling and joyful.

　　We often think of the Volunteer Army uncles, thinking of you fighting the enemy bravely in the freezing cold, advancing fearlessly... Thinking of our current life, thinking of the future of our motherland, we feel infinite glory and pride. When we think of the American wolves trampling on the land of Korea and slaughtering the Korean people and children, anger and hatred surge in our hearts!

　　Volunteer Army uncles! We clearly know that it is because you are bravely fighting the American bandits in Korea that we can live a free, happy, and peaceful life. You said you guarantee to drive the devils into the sea and guarantee our happy lives. We also assure you that we will study hard, exercise, and build our motherland like the Soviet Union in the future, and will never let down the people and your expectations.

　　Volunteer Army uncles! Heroically kill the enemy and wipe out the bandits! When you return to the motherland in glory, be sure to come to Beijing Elementary School. We are waiting for you and all the Volunteer Army uncles!

With revolutionary respect!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　All Sixth-Grade Students of Beijing Elementary School
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　March 26th

Editor's Note: After the People's Daily published a letter from Comrade Yu Chunhai, medical orderly of the Second Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, entitled "To the Children of Our Motherland, Flesh and Blood," on the first page of the newspaper on March 23rd, we soon received a reply from all the sixth-grade students of Beijing Elementary School. They also gave Comrade Yu Chunhai a woodcut of Stalin and two two-inch photos. On the back of one photo, they wrote that they were "playing at the foot of Longevity Hill," and on the back of the other photo, they wrote: "Exercise well and stand on the front line of national defense in the future." This is the love and respect of the children of the motherland for the Volunteer Army comrades far away on the Korean battlefield; at the same time, it is also a demonstration by the children of the motherland against the American bandits who threaten their happy lives.

### 英勇杀敌把强盗们消灭干净——北京小学六年级全体同学复给中国人民志愿军某部二连卫生员于春海同志的一封信

　　英勇杀敌把强盗们消灭干净        
    ——北京小学六年级全体同学复给中国人民志愿军某部二连卫生员于春海同志的一封信敬爱的于春海叔叔：
    在三月二十三日的人民日报上，看到了你来的信。你的信，充分地表现着对我们的关心和爱护。我们都是怎样的高兴和感激啊！
    我们是人民首都一个干部子弟学校里的学生。在老师的教导下，我们努力地学习着，还组织了各种课外活动小组，像腰鼓队、舞蹈组、技巧队等。我们的生活真是说不出的美满和愉快。
    我们常常怀念着志愿军叔叔们，想到你们在冰天雪地里英勇地杀敌，无畏地前进……，想到我们现在的生活，想到祖国的未来，就感到无限的光荣和骄傲；当我们想到美国狼正在践踏着朝鲜的土地、屠杀朝鲜人民和儿童的时候，心中就涌起了愤怒和仇恨！
    志愿军叔叔们！我们清楚地知道：由于你们在朝鲜和美国强盗英勇作战，我们才能过着自由幸福和平的日子。你说保证把鬼子赶到海里去，保证我们的幸福生活，我们也要向叔叔们保证，一定好好学习，锻炼身体，将来把祖国建设得像苏联一样，决不辜负人民和你们的期望。
    志愿军叔叔们！英勇的杀敌罢，把强盗们消灭干净！等你们光荣地回到祖国来的时候，一定要到北京小学来。我们在等待着你和所有的志愿军叔叔们！此致革命的敬礼！
                                北京小学六年级全体同学
                                                  三月二十六日
    编者按：三月二十三日在本报一版登载了中国人民志愿军某部二连卫生员于春海同志“写给骨肉相连的祖国儿童”的信后，不久我们便收到了北京小学六年级全体同学给他的一封回信。他们还赠给于春海同志一幅斯大林的木刻像，和两张二寸照片。在一张照片的后面写着，说他们正“在万寿山脚下做游戏”，在另一张照片的后面他们写着：“好好锻炼身体，将来站在国防最前线”。这是祖国儿童们对于远在朝鲜战地的志愿军同志们的敬爱；同时也是祖国儿童对于威胁着他们幸福生活的美国强盗的示威。
