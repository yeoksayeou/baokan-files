　　Tangshan Steel Plant Sets Four New Records in a Row
　　Steel ingot production exceeds highest record since factory's founding by fifty-six percent.
　　In less than a month, the steelmaking workers of the Tangshan Steel Plant successively created four new steel ingot production records since the factory's founding. With the factory's highest daily steel ingot production in 1950 as 100, it was increased to 103.5 on February 13; on February 18, it continued to increase to 125; on March 3, it further increased to 127.5; and on March 9, it reached 156.35. These four new records have collectively increased the wealth of the nation by more than 580,000 catties of millet.
　　The main reason for the emergence of the aforementioned new records is that the factory's workers have improved their production technology. In the labor emulation drive, they improved the use of current and voltage, shortening the smelting time of each furnace of steel by half an hour. This increased output and also saved electricity. The raw materials for steelmaking and the main auxiliary material for electric furnace steelmaking, carbon rods, have changed since liberation compared to before liberation. Initially, the workers were unfamiliar with the new raw materials and domestically produced carbon rods, and did not use them well. For example, the carbon rods often broke during smelting. Later, due to diligent study of technology, the workers mastered the performance of the raw materials, and as a result, overcame the above difficulties, and output continued to increase.

　　唐山钢厂连创四次新纪录       
    钢锭产量超过建厂最高纪录百分之五十六
    唐山钢厂炼钢工人在不到一个月的时间内，连续创造了四次建厂以来的钢锭产量新纪录。以一九五○年该厂钢锭最高日产量为一百，二月十三日提高到一百零三点五；二月十八日继续提高到一百二十五；三月三日再提高到一百二十七点五；三月九日又达到一百五十六点三五。这四次新纪录共约为国家增加五十八万多斤小米的财富。
    上述新纪录出现的主要原因，是该厂工人提高了生产技术。他们在劳动竞赛中改进了电流、电压的使用法，使每炉钢的冶炼时间缩短了半小时。这样就增加了产量，还节省了电力。该厂炼钢原料和电炉炼钢的主要辅助材料炭棒，解放后较解放前有了改变。开始时，工人对新原料和本国炭棒都很生疏，使用不好。如冶炼时炭棒常常折断。后来由于钻研技术，工人们掌握了原材料的性能，结果，克服了以上困难，产量也不断提高了。
