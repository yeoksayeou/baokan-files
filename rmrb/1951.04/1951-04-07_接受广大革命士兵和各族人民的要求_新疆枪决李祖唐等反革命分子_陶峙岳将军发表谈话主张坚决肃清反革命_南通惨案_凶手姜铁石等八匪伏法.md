Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 6th: The Military Law Department of the Xinjiang Military Region, accepting the demands of the broad masses of revolutionary soldiers and people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, sentenced twelve leading counter-revolutionary elements, including Li Zuitang, Chen Gongfu, and Xu Jinxian, to death in Dihua on March 20th and executed them by firing squad on the same day. These counter-revolutionary elements were all special agents who sabotaged the uprising of the Kuomintang troops in Xinjiang before the uprising and continued to maintain contact with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan after the uprising, plotting to organize riots and rebellions.

　　Bandit Li Zuitang was the former commander of the 65th Brigade of the Kuomintang army. Before and after the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang, in addition to accepting secret orders from the two bandit leaders Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan to actively incite the troops and attempt to resist the People's Liberation Army's advance into Xinjiang, he also instructed his troops to carry out extensive burning, killing, and looting in Kuqa, Turpan, and other places. Bandit Chen Gongfu was the former commander of the 533rd Regiment of the 178th Brigade of the Kuomintang army. When General Tao Zhiyue telegraphed the uprising and the People's Liberation Army was about to enter Xinjiang, he led his bandit troops to burn down Hami city, destroying 227 civilian houses, looting people's property beyond measure, and killing four farmers, including Wang Shugan, causing the people of Hami to suffer unprecedented devastation. Bandit Xu Jinxian, after American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, carried out preparations to "welcome" Chiang Kai-shek's "counter-offensive"; and on November 20th of last year, he instructed his henchmen to administer poison in the People's Liberation Army. The other nine were also important counter-revolutionary elements who sabotaged the uprising and carried out sabotage activities after the uprising.

　　After the Military Law Department of the Xinjiang Military Region executed the aforementioned leading counter-revolutionary elements, it received enthusiastic support from all revolutionary soldiers and officers with a sense of justice and patriotism in the uprising troops. They unanimously stated: "We must strive to strengthen and consolidate the people's armed forces, complete thorough transformation, and maintain the glory of the uprising."

　　General Tao Zhiyue, Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and Commander of the 22nd Army Corps, also issued a statement on this matter, saying: "The Xinjiang Military Region recently, in accordance with the 'Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries,' executed twelve counter-revolutionary ringleaders such as Li Zuitang and Chen Gongfu, whose crimes were heinous. The broad masses of people in Xinjiang and the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army wholeheartedly support this wise and decisive measure to suppress counter-revolutionaries. This group of counter-revolutionary elements had been given leniency and education by the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army after liberation, hoping that they would recognize their past crimes, sincerely resolve to reform, and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes before the people. However, these incorrigible reactionary elements remained stubbornly opposed to enlightenment and continued to openly or covertly carry out sabotage activities, resolutely opposing the people. Their crimes are deeply hated by the masses of the people. We can only resolutely suppress these counter-revolutionary elements who are determined to do evil to the end. Consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and ensuring the security of the motherland is the sacred duty of our People's Liberation Army. We must cleanly and thoroughly eliminate all open or lurking enemies; especially the commanders and fighters of the uprising troops, in order to promote our loyalty to loving the motherland and consolidate the achievements we have gained in political education over the past year, should draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves and take a firm stand. Between the enemy and ourselves, there is only a resolute struggle to the death, without any room for 'mercy' or hesitation. This suppression of counter-revolutionary elements has already dealt a severe blow to the lurking enemy, and we will continue to do so in the future to completely eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th: Jiang Tieshi and seven other Kuomintang special agents, the murderers who manufactured the "March 18th" massacre in Nantong, northern Jiangsu, five years ago, have been executed in Nantong City.

　　In 1946, on the eve of the Kuomintang reactionaries tearing up the truce agreement and launching a full-scale civil war, Mr. Dunk, the American representative of the "Military Mediation Executive Department Huaiyin Executive Group," arrived in Nantong from Huaiyin on March 18th. The city's Democratic Youth Federation and various people's organizations held high the banner of "Oppose civil war, strive for peace, and strive for democracy" and marched in petition. At that time, Jiang Tieshi, a Kuomintang special agent who was the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Office and concurrently the investigation specialist of the Nantong County Office, secretly met with the American representative at the Tao Zhihua Hotel, the residence of the "Executive Group," and dispatched special agents Cai Hanjie, Tang Lun, Zhou Shanruo, Li Shichang, Wang Zhide, Zhong Yue, Ye Ziliang, and others to suppress the movement of youth from all walks of life who opposed the civil war and strived for peace. They successively arrested eight people, including Qian Sufan, a teacher at Nantong Middle School, Sun Pingtian, a reporter for Xintong Daily, and Gu Xunyi, a director of the Literary Association, and killed them using cruel tortures such as burying them alive, throwing them into the river, gouging out their eyes, and cutting off their ears.

　　After Nantong was liberated in 1949, Jiang Tieshi and the other seven murderers were successively arrested by the People's Government. On March 18th of this year, more than 1,500 representatives from all walks of life in Nantong City gathered to accuse the crimes of this group of special agent bandits. The Military Control Commission of Nantong City, in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries," sentenced the special agent murderers Jiang Tieshi and seven others to death and executed them by firing squad on the same day.

    【新华社西安六日电】新疆军区军法处接受广大革命士兵和新疆各民族人民的要求，于三月二十日在迪化判处首要反革命分子李祖唐、陈公辅、许进贤等十二人死刑，并于同日执行枪决。这批反革命分子都是在新疆国民党部队起义前破坏起义，起义后继续与台湾蒋匪帮保持联系，阴谋组织暴动与叛乱的特务分子。
    李匪祖唐，系前国民党军六十五旅旅长，在新疆和平解放前后，他除接受蒋介石、胡宗南两匪首密令，积极煽惑部队，力图抗拒人民解放军进军新疆外，并曾指使所部在库车、吐鲁番等地大肆烧杀抢劫。陈匪公辅，系前国民党军第一七八旅五三三团团长，他在陶峙岳将军通电起义、人民解放军即将进入新疆时，率其匪部火烧哈密城，烧毁民房二百二十七间，抢劫人民的财产难以数计，并杀死农民王树干等四人，使哈密人民遭受空前的洗劫。许匪进贤，在美帝国主义发动侵朝战争后，曾进行“迎接”蒋匪“反攻”的准备工作；并于去年十一月二十日指使其爪牙在人民解放军中施放毒药。其他九人，也都是破坏起义和起义后进行破坏活动的重要反革命分子。
    新疆军区军法处将上述首要反革命分子枪决后，得到全体革命士兵和起义部队中具有正义感和爱国心的军官们的热烈拥护。他们一致表示：要为“加强巩固人民武装力量，完成彻底改造，保持起义光荣而奋斗。”
    人民解放军新疆军区副司令员、二十二兵团司令员陶峙岳将军并为此发表谈话称：“新疆军区最近依据《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》，处决了李祖唐、陈公辅等十二名罪大恶极的反革命首要分子，新疆广大人民及人民解放军的指战员们，对这一明智果断的镇压反革命措施，竭诚拥护。这一批反革命分子，解放后曾经人民政府及人民解放军予以宽大、教育，希望他们认识过去的罪恶行为，痛下改过决心，在人民面前立功赎罪。但是，这些怙恶不悛的反动分子，仍然顽固到底，不肯觉悟，继续公开或隐蔽的进行破坏活动，坚决与人民为敌，其罪恶深为人民群众所痛恨。对于这些决心作恶到底的反革命分子，我们只有坚决予以镇压。巩固人民民主专政，确保祖国的安全，是我们人民解放军的天职，我们必须干净、彻底地肃清一切公开或潜伏的敌人；尤其是起义部队的指战员同志们，为发扬我们热爱祖国的忠忱，巩固我们一年多来在政治教育中获得的成绩，应划清敌我之间的界限，坚定立场。敌我之间，只有你死我活的坚决斗争，没有任何‘仁慈’和犹豫的余地。这次对于反革命分子的镇压，已经给潜伏的敌人以严重的打击，我们今后仍将继续这样做，以彻底消灭一切隐藏的反革命分子。”
    【新华社上海六日电】五年前在苏北南通制造“三、一八”惨案的凶手国民党特务姜铁石等八人，已在南通市伏法。
    一九四六年，国民党反动派撕毁停战协定发动全面内战前夕，“军事调处执行部淮阴执行小组”美国代表邓克于三月十八日由淮阴至南通。该市民主青年联合各人民团体高举“反对内战、争取和平、争取民主”的旗帜，游行请愿。当时，国民党特务中统江苏省室督导兼南通县室调查专员姜铁石即与美国代表在“执行小组”驻地桃之华旅馆秘密开会，派遣特务蔡汉杰、唐伦、周善若、理世昌、王志德、仲岳、叶子梁等人，镇压各界青年反对内战争取和平的运动，先后逮捕了南通中学教师钱素凡、新通日报记者孙平天、文艺协会理事顾迅一等八人，用活埋、投江、挖眼睛、割耳朵等毒刑杀害了他们。
    一九四九年南通解放后，姜匪铁石等八名凶手先后为人民政府逮捕归案。今年三月十八日，南通市各界人民代表一千五百余人集会控诉这批特务匪徒的罪行。南通市军事管制委员会所组织的军事法庭依照《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》，判处特务凶手姜铁石等八人死刑，并于是日执行枪决。
