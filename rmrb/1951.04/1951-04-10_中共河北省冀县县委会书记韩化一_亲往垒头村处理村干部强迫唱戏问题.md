　　CCP Hebei Jixian County Committee Secretary Han Huayi
　  Personally Handles the Issue of Village Cadres Forcing Villagers to Stage a Play in Leitou Village

Comrade Editor:

    After your newspaper published "Village Cadres in Jixian's Leitou Village Forcibly Stage an Opera and Engage in Extravagant Eating and Drinking" in the "Reader's Letters" section on January 24th, and the article "CCP Jixian County Propaganda Minister Unprincipledly Attacks Critics" on March 6th, in addition to making a public self-criticism in your newspaper on March 17th, on March 15th, I led six cadres from the Communist Youth League, the Armed Forces Department, and the County Committee Office, together with cadres from the district, to the village to investigate the spring plowing and production situation, and to understand the truth of the final results of the village's struggle and the problem of wasteful spending on the play. After seven days of investigation, it was proven that the problems reflected by Comrade Fan Weijun were basically consistent with the facts. The village cadres wanted to raise funds to repair the elementary school because the school building was damaged. At that time, influenced by the neighboring village's staging of a play, they attempted to raise funds by staging a play themselves. Several key village cadres, during a meeting in the district, used the excuse of the masses' opinions to request instructions from Comrade Feng Deshui, the CCP District Committee Secretary, who then forwarded it to the County Committee for approval. After returning to the village, they convened a meeting of village cadres and team leaders (twenty-five households as one team) and said: "The money earned will be used to repair the elementary school. If there is a loss, each village cadre will contribute one *shi* of wheat." The team leaders then mobilized the masses. However, the team leaders did not seriously collect the opinions of the masses. When it came to setting up the stage and needing straw mats, they forcibly requisitioned mats from the masses; they also forcibly requisitioned labor to set up the stage. Some people had work to do at home and were forced to find someone to replace them. The village cadres did not check and correct these situations in a timely manner. The economic loss from staging this play was also significant, for example: there were seventy to eighty people taking care of the performance day and night, and they consumed more than 1,900 *jin* of steamed buns in eight days; also, because the play was not good, the refund of tickets to the masses cost 1.6 million yuan; and each household wasted an average of 100,000 yuan on entertaining relatives and friends. Therefore, the masses expressed much dissatisfaction.

    After our research, we believe that although the village cadres' motives for staging the play stemmed from their work, it was extremely wrong to falsely claim that they had the opinion of the masses to deceive the higher authorities. Failure to solicit the opinions of the masses is the result of commandism, which violates the mass line. The forced requisition of supplies and labor is an even more bureaucratic style that is divorced from the masses. After inspection, we have taken the following actions against the relevant personnel: Zheng Fushi, the District Cadre and Deputy Secretary of the CCP Branch in the village, acted arbitrarily and was divorced from the masses during the proceedings; afterwards, without the consent of the masses or the approval of the higher authorities, he dismantled five rooms (the original draft mistakenly stated eight rooms) of the dilapidated houses of the victory fruits seized by the Farmers' Association that had not yet been distributed, and used part of the wood to buy costumes, causing dissatisfaction among poor farmers. Although Zheng Fushi has consistently been active and responsible in his work in the past, in order to educate him to correct his mistakes, establish a correct democratic style, and better serve the people, he is hereby given a public warning. Comrade Fan Weijun's ability to persist in criticizing phenomena that harm the interests of the Party and the people is good and should be promoted. In the future, he should further strengthen the spirit of seeking truth from facts with a kind attitude towards others, in order to overcome the exaggeration to some extent in his reporting.

          Han Huayi, Secretary of the CCP Jixian County Committee

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　中共河北省冀县县委会书记韩化一
　  亲往垒头村处理村干部强迫唱戏问题编辑同志：
    一月二十四日贵报“读者来信专页”发表“冀县垒头村干部强迫唱大戏及吃喝浪费”及三月六日所载“中共冀县县委宣传部长无原则的打击批评者”的批评后，除已在贵报三月十七日作公开检讨外，三月十五日曾由我率领青年团、武装部、县委办公室干部六人协同该区干部到达该村，结合检查春耕生产，了解该村斗争果实尾数及唱戏浪费问题的真象。经过七天调查，证明樊维钧同志所反映的问题基本上是符合事实的。该村干部因小学的房子破坏，想筹款修建，当时受了邻村唱戏的影响，企图用唱戏来筹款。几个主要村干部在区开会时，就以群众意见为名请示中共区委书记冯德水同志，继又转县委会批准。他们回村后召开村干部会，大组长会（二十五户为一大组）说：“赚了钱修小学。赔了，村干部每人摊一石麦子”。由大组长发动群众。但大组长并未认真收集群众意见。搭戏棚需席的时候，便强向群众征席；又强征劳力搭棚。有的群众家里有活，被迫找人代替。这些情况村干部都没有随时检查纠正。唱了这场戏，经济上的损失也很大，如：日夜照顾演戏就有七、八十人，八天中吃了一千九百多斤馒头；又因为戏不好，群众退票赔了一百六十万元；群众招待亲朋每户平均也浪费十万元左右。因此群众多表示不满。
    我们研究结果，认为该村干部唱戏动机虽由工作出发，但假借群众意见，欺瞒上级，是十分错误的。不征求群众意见，是违反群众路线的命令主义的思想在作祟。强征用具和劳力，更是脱离群众的官僚主义作风。经检查后，我们对有关人员，已作如下处理：小区干部兼该村中共支部副支部书记郑福石，在事情进行中独断专行，脱离群众；事后又未经群众同意及上级批准，拆毁了农会占用的未分下去的胜利果实破房子五间（原稿误为八间），以一部分木料买了戏装，致使贫苦农民不满。虽然郑福石过去工作一贯积极负责，但为了教育他改正错误，树立正确的民主作风，更好地为人民服务，特给以当众警告处分。樊维钧同志能坚持向危害党和人民利益的现象进行批评，这种精神是好的，应予以发扬。今后应以与人为善的态度，进一步加强实事求是的精神，以克服报道中的某种程度的夸大现象。
