　　Fighting in the Enemy's Heart
    ——A True Account of the Annihilation Battle North of Hengcheng, Part 1
    Li Wen, Yi Ding

    In mid-February, the US Second Infantry Division's Ninth Regiment and the Syngman Rhee puppet army's Eighth Division, serving as the vanguard of MacArthur's "limited offensive" on the eastern front, advanced at a snail's pace of one and a half kilometers per day, shrinking back to the Shangxia Yugou line, about sixty *li* northwest of Hengcheng. This pitiful "progress" made MacArthur so elated that he revived his old tune of "approaching the 38th parallel, controlling the territory occupied by the Republic of Korea" in order to "advance towards the Manchurian border in the future." Just as the bandits were complacent, a heavy iron fist suddenly struck them. On the night of February 11th, a heroic unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army suddenly appeared behind the positions of the US Second Infantry Division's Ninth Regiment and the Syngman Rhee puppet army's Eighth Division, thrusting straight into the enemy's heart and crushing the enemy's divisional and regimental headquarters. The rash enemy (about three regiments strong) did not even have time to turn around before its rear was cut off by the spearhead units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The entire enemy front line immediately fell into chaos. Within twenty-four hours, more than 12,900 enemy troops were divided and annihilated in the mountainous area of several tens of *li* to the north and south of Hengcheng and to the east and west of Guangtianli (the headquarters of the Syngman Rhee puppet army's Eighth Division, located more than ten *li* northwest of Hengcheng).

    At dusk on February 11th, sporadic gunfire echoed from the forward positions. Dozens of enemy planes blindly bombed the villages on the ground, as usual. At this moment, a Chinese People's Volunteer Army unit, which had repeatedly performed meritorious deeds on the Korean battlefield, was traversing the ridges dotted with enemy troops, advancing rapidly towards the enemy's hinterland—Guangtianli. This was a glorious and arduous task. This Volunteer Army unit had to find a gap in the mountain positions densely packed with two regiments of enemy troops and thrust fiercely into the enemy's heart. Our Volunteer Army had to be unafraid of enemy flanking attacks, had to cross sixty *li* of high mountains and steep cliffs, and had to capture Guangtianli before dawn. "Penetrate the enemy's heart and blossom," "Occupying Guangtianli means victory"—the Volunteer Army soldiers, encouraged by this glorious spearhead mission, plunged into the enemy ranks fearlessly.

    Night. Deep snow covered the mountains and fields. The silent deep mountains echoed with rustling footsteps—the spearhead units were running forward. Zhou Xiangshuang, the squad leader of the assault squad, led two soldiers at the forefront of the team. Suddenly, machine gun fire erupted from the mountain ahead, bullets flashing past Zhou Xiangshuang's ear. Zhou Xiangshuang knew that the enemy had discovered them and that they must now catch them off guard. So, he shouted loudly, "Machine gun team, come up quickly!" Machine gunner Zhou Simo fully understood the value of time. He straightened his back, held his machine gun, and charged towards the enemy, firing fiercely. Three enemies fell, and the enemy's machine gun no longer fired. The warriors of the Eighth Squad rushed up the mountain like flying, and the enemies who were not dead rolled down the mountain one after another. The spearhead units ignored them and continued to advance rapidly.

    Enemy artillery blocked the spearhead units along the way. Shrapnel tore the warriors’ ration bags on their backs, but the warriors continued to advance. The mountain was steep and the snow was slippery. Many warriors fell, their hands and faces scraped, but they got up and continued to advance. Advancing upright, advancing bent over, sometimes advancing crawling. In any case, the warriors kept moving forward. At this time, people had only one belief: "Penetrate means victory," "Hold on to the enemy!"

    The spearhead units appeared on the northern mountain of Guangtianli at the scheduled time. Gunfire rang out in the enemy's rear, and the enemy was completely confused. The enemy in Guangtianli fled in panic without resistance, and the enemy north and west of Guangtianli were immediately thrown into chaos because their rear was cut off. On a section of the highway half a *li* due west of Guangtianli, more than a hundred trucks carrying heavy artillery, command vehicles, and supply vehicles collided with each other in a scramble for escape, and the sound of motorcycles and the shouts of the enemy army were mixed together. On the slopes, in the rice fields, the despondent enemy ran everywhere. The warriors of the Seventh Company chased and fired fiercely at the routed enemy, shouting as they fired, "Let me see where you run!" These warriors charged so fiercely that the enemy machine gunners did not even have time to set up their machine guns before they were killed beside their guns. At this time, two clumsy enemy tanks were trying to escape, but they ran into the trap set for them by the Volunteer Army warriors. Yu Shuiling, a Youth League member of the Fifth Squad, vaguely saw the first tank rolling in with its turret cover open. According to past experience in fighting tanks, this was the best opportunity. He held the grenade tightly in his right hand and waited for the tank to roll to about ten meters away. Suddenly, he jumped up, pounced on the tank, and threw the grenade into the turret cover. The tank spewed out a ball of fire, rolled a dozen more steps, and stopped moving. Seeing the bad situation, the tank behind panicked and fired randomly. "Tanks are not scary, we have armor-piercing mines!" The Fifth Squad leader shouted, holding the armor-piercing mine, just about to pounce when Yu Shuiling snatched the armor-piercing mine. "I'll go!" "You must complete the task!" "I won't come back until the task is completed!" Yu Shuiling rushed nimbly to the side of the tank. He had just approached the tank when he was fired upon by the American soldiers behind the tank. A bullet pierced his thigh, but he gritted his teeth and straightened up to pounce. The rear of the tank exploded, and Yu Shuiling also fell to the ground, his trousers stained red with blood. But he did not say a word, continued to pull out a grenade from his waist, and threw it at the American soldiers.

    The sky was dimly lit, and dense gunfire rang out on the mountains around Guangtianli. The People's Volunteer Army spearhead units divided into many "small spearheads" and seized the high ground and important positions. The chaotic enemy still tried to escape to the south, but a certain company of the Volunteer Army had seized the high ground wedged into the intersection of the east-west and north-south highways, blocking the enemy's escape route.

    The enemy knew that they could not escape without pulling out this nail. They used all their weapons: mortars and heavy machine guns from the front, left, and right mountains, and tank guns from the highway, concentrating their fire on the high ground. Infantry followed and pounced up. The Volunteer Army warriors heard rustling sounds in the withered grass. Soon, the first five American soldiers had climbed to the front. Deng Baiming, the squad leader of the Fourth Squad, suddenly jumped out of the fortifications, snatched the carbine from the first devil with one hand, and strangled the devil's neck with the other. The devil howled and rolled down the hillside with his head in his arms. The enemies behind him also fled down the mountain in panic.

    One after another, the American infantry's counterattacks were beaten back.

    The battle continued. The pine trees on the Volunteer Army positions were broken by the artillery fire, the rocks were blackened by the smoke, the fortifications were overturned time and again by shrapnel, and the mountain tops were plowed by artillery barrages. However, the Volunteer Army's positions stood still, and the Volunteer Army's machine guns continued to sweep the enemy crowding the highway and trying to escape. Hou Chengzhen, a 60mm mortar gunner, ran out of ammunition and picked up the wounded comrade's automatic rifle to aim and shoot. Gao Jipu, a machine gunner, had his shoulder pierced by an enemy bullet, but continued to sweep the enemy. The squad leader and deputy squad leader of the Ninth Squad were both killed. Warrior Zhao Bingji crawled out of the collapsed fortifications, brushed off the dirt on his body, and encouraged the warriors beside him: "Although there are many enemies, they are all defeated soldiers. As long as we persevere, we will win. We have automatic rifles and grenades, we can't let the enemy run away!"

    In this way, they held on to the enemy tightly.

    Of course, artillery fire could not save the enemy army from its doomed fate. Thousands of enemies on the highway were blocked and annihilated. The chaotic enemy gradually dispersed, hundreds of people in one group, dozens of people in another, bumping around in every mountain and valley, like ants on a hot pot. Volunteer Army units from different directions tracked and pressed down, and a platoon, a squad, a warrior of the Volunteer Army, plunged into the enemy ranks bravely, killing the stubborn enemies and capturing prisoners. The Volunteer Army's loud charge bugle tore the souls of the US-Syngman Rhee bandit army. Now the enemy was no longer routed, but scattered.

    The enemy army that had been thrown into chaos had been looking forward to the day, looking forward to the arrival of their planes. Therefore, when the sky was bright, many signal boards for liaison aircraft were scattered on the mountaintops and in the valleys, red and yellow. However, at this time, the Volunteer Army warriors were already tightly intertwined with the enemy army, and dozens of enemy planes hovered anxiously at low altitude, watching helplessly as groups of US-Syngman Rhee bandit army were captured by us.

    The political instructor of a certain company, who was responsible for blocking the enemy on the high ground of the eastern mountain of Guangtianli, saw from afar that thousands of bandits were being tracked and pursued by the Volunteer Army from the north, and were fleeing south in a panic. He thought: "The time for the attack has come." He did not wait for orders and led a platoon of warriors down the mountain. More than thirty enemies came face to face. The political instructor rushed into the enemy ranks, kicked away the carbine of the leading bandit with one kick. Yuan Yibao, the squad leader of the Third Squad, pointed his submachine gun at the enemy's chest. The two enemies in front quickly turned their heads and waved their hands. Then, more than thirty enemies dropped their guns in astonishment and raised their hands.

    The warriors of the Third Platoon who were still in the positions could no longer bear it when they saw the First Platoon capturing prisoners. Tang Shouzhi, a warrior of the Eighth Squad, shouted excitedly, "There are so many prisoners, hurry down the mountain to catch them!" A group of enemy troops fleeing south encountered the warriors of the Third Platoon and turned their heads to run randomly towards the mountain on the flank. Guo Yourong, the squad leader, led the machine gun team and quickly inserted into the mountainside, sweeping fiercely. Ding Changfu, the platoon leader of the Third Platoon, led the Eighth Squad and took the opportunity to block the mouth of the ditch. More than forty US-Syngman Rhee soldiers were completely stuck. The platoon leader of the Third Platoon gestured with his hands to let them surrender their guns. The first American soldier walked out of the ditch, knelt on his right leg, supported the ground with his right hand, and raised his carbine with his trembling left hand. The platoon leader of the Third Platoon let the American soldier stand up. The American soldier saluted respectfully and offered his leather bag to the platoon leader of the Third Platoon. The platoon leader of the Third Platoon refused the leather bag, patted the American soldier on the shoulder, and told him not to be afraid. The facts educated this American soldier. He turned around and shouted loudly, summoning his companions. Twenty-five American soldiers and more than ten Syngman Rhee puppet soldiers walked out one after another, putting down their weapons in a similar posture.

    Not far from the mouth of the ditch, in this mountainous area of several tens of *li*, MacArthur's subordinates were performing various wonderful surrender performances at this time. Some had their heads drooping and their hands raised high; some knelt on both knees and held their carbines with both hands; some had their heads on the ground and their buttocks facing the sky...

    The "mobile warfare" boasted by MacArthur was thus destroyed by the iron fists of the heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

　　战斗在敌人心脏
    ——横城以北歼灭战纪实之一
    力文　以丁
    二月中旬，担任麦克阿瑟“有限攻势”的东路先锋美军第二师第九团和李承晚伪军第八师等部，以每日一公里半的速度，缩头缩脑地窜到横城西北六十余里的上下榆沟一线。这个可怜的“进展”，使得麦克阿瑟得意忘形，重弹起“逼近三八线，控制大韩民国所占领土”以便“将来向满洲边境进军”的旧调。匪徒们正在洋洋得意的时候，一只沉重的铁拳突然打在它们的身上。二月十一日夜，英勇的中国人民志愿军某部，突然出现在美军第二师第九团和李承晚伪军第八师阵地后方，直插敌人心脏，击溃了敌人的师团指挥所。冒进之敌（约三个团之众）还没有来得及掉转屁股，它的后路已被中国人民志愿军某部的尖刀部队切断。敌人全线立刻陷于混乱状态。在二十四小时内，一万二千九百余名敌军，被分割聚歼在横城南北、广田里（横城西北十余里，李伪军第八师指挥所驻地）东西，方圆数十里的山地里。

    二月十一日黄昏，前沿阵地响着时密时疏的枪炮声。数十架敌机和往常一样，盲目轰炸着地面的村庄。此刻，一支在朝鲜战场上屡建战功的中国人民志愿军部队，正在穿越满布敌军的山岭，向着敌军腹地——广田里疾进。这是一个光荣而艰巨的任务。这支志愿军要从密布着两团敌军的山头阵地中，寻觅一个空隙，猛插到敌军心脏中。我志愿军必须不怕敌人侧击，必须翻越六十里的高山陡崖，在拂晓前攻占广田里。“插到敌人心脏开花”，“占领广田里就是胜利”——志愿军战士们为这种光荣的尖刀任务鼓舞着，奋不顾身地钻入敌阵之中。
    夜。漫山遍野覆盖着深雪。寂静的深山中响着唰唰的脚步声——尖刀部队在跑步前进。突击班班长周祥双带着两个战士，走在队伍的最前面。突然迎面山头上响起机枪，子弹闪着光，从周祥双的耳边擦过。周祥双知道敌人已经发现自己，现在必须打它个措手不及。于是，他大声喊道“机枪组快上来！”。机枪射手周思谟十分懂得时间的宝贵，他挺直腰干，端着机枪，向着敌人猛冲猛扫。三个敌人倒下去了，敌人的机枪再也不叫了。八班勇士飞似地奔上山头，没有死的敌人纷纷滚下山去。尖刀部队没有理会他们，继续快步向前挺进。
    敌人的排炮沿路封锁尖刀部队。弹片擦破了战士们背上的干粮袋，战士们继续前进。山陡雪滑，许多战士跌倒了，手摔破了，脸擦破了，爬起来继续前进。直着腰前进，弯着腰前进，有时是爬着前进。无论如何，战士们是不停地前进。这时人们只有一个信念：“插到就是胜利”，“紧紧抓住敌人！”
    尖刀部队按照预定时刻，出现在广田里北山。敌人的腹地响起枪声，敌人完全混乱了。广田里之敌没有招架即仓惶逃命，广田里以北及以西之敌因后路已被切断，立刻乱成一团。在广田里正西半里路的一段公路上，有一百多辆拉着重炮的卡车、指挥车、辎重车，互相夺路冲撞，摩托声和敌军的呼喊声搅成一片。山坡上，稻田里，到处奔跑着丧魂落魄的敌人。七连的战士向着溃乱的敌群追逐猛扫，一面打枪，一面喊着：“我看你们向那里跑！”。这些战士冲得是这样凶猛，敌人的机枪射手还来不及架好机枪，就倒毙在枪旁了。这时，敌人两辆笨重的坦克正在夺路逃命，结果跑进志愿军战士们替它们布置的天罗地网中。五班的青年团员于水陵，隐约看见头一辆坦克张着炮塔盖子，嗡嗡地滚来。根据过去打坦克的经验，这是最好的时机了。他右手紧握着炸弹，等坦克滚到十米左右，蓦地跳起来，扑向坦克，把炸弹扔进塔盖里。坦克喷出一团火焰，又滚了十几步，停下不动了。后面那辆坦克见势不妙，慌张地乱打炮。“坦克不可怕，我们有破甲雷！”五班长拿着破甲雷喊着，正要扑上去，破甲雷却被于水陵夺过去了。“我去！”“你一定要完成任务！”“不完成任务不回来！”于水陵敏捷地冲向坦克侧翼。他刚刚靠近坦克，被坦克后面的美国兵猛射了一阵子。一颗子弹穿透了他的大腿，但他咬紧牙挺身扑上去。坦克的尾部爆炸了，于水陵也倒在地上，血染红了裤腿。但他没有吭声，继续从腰中拔出一颗手榴弹，向美国兵掷去。
      ×                                ×                  ×
    天朦朦亮了，以广田里为中心的四面山上，响起紧密的枪声。人民志愿军尖刀部队又分出许多“小尖刀”，分别抢占制高点和重要的阵地。混乱的敌人还企图夺路南逃，但志愿军某连已抢占了楔入东西和南北两条公路交叉点上的高地，堵住敌人的逃路。
    敌人知道不拔掉这个钉子，他们是无法逃脱的。他们用尽所有的武器：前山、左右山上的迫击炮、重机枪，公路上的坦克炮，集中向高地轰击。步兵跟着扑上来。志愿军战士们听见枯草中有沙沙的声音，不久，最前面的五个美国兵已经爬到跟前。四班长邓百铭蓦地跃出工事，用一只手夺过来头一个鬼子的卡宾枪，另一只手勒住这个鬼子的脖子。这个鬼子嚎叫一声，抱着头滚下山坡。跟在后面的敌人，也纷纷向山下狂奔逃命。
    一次又一次，美军步兵的反击被打下去了。
    战斗继续进行着。志愿军阵地上的松树被炮火轰折了，岩石被硝烟薰黑了，工事一次又一次被弹片掀翻了，山头被排炮犁遍了。但是，志愿军的阵地屹立未动，志愿军的机枪继续猛扫公路上拥挤逃命的敌人。六○炮炮手侯成真打光了炮弹，便拿起负伤同志的自动步枪瞄准射击。机枪射手高吉浦，肩部被敌弹打穿了，仍继续猛扫敌人。九班正副班长都牺牲了，战士赵炳基从毁塌的工事里爬出来，拂去身上的泥土，鼓励身旁战士说：“敌人虽多都是败兵。我们只要坚持便是胜利。我们有自动步枪、手榴弹，不能让敌人跑掉！”
    就这样，他们紧紧地拖住了敌人。

    当然，炮火不能拯救敌军覆灭的命运。公路上成千的敌人被堵截着，被聚歼着。乱成一团的敌人逐渐分散开了，数百人一股，几十人一群，在每个山头和山谷中乱撞，活像热锅上的蚂蚁。来自不同方向的志愿军跟踪压下来，志愿军的一个排、一个班、一个战士，勇猛地插入敌群，杀伤顽抗敌人和捕捉俘虏。志愿军嘹亮的冲锋号声，撕碎了美李匪军的魂魄。现在敌人已经不是溃乱，而是溃散了。
    被插乱的敌军曾经盼望着白天，盼望着他们的飞机的来临。因此，当着天色大亮的时候，山顶上、山谷中，红一片黄一片地散布着许多联络飞机的信号板。但是，这时候，志愿军战士已经和敌军紧紧地扭在一起了，几十架敌机焦急地低空盘旋，无可奈何地看着一股股美李匪军被我捕捉。
    在广田里东山高地上担任堵击任务的某连指导员，远远看到上千的匪军被来自北面的志愿军跟踪追击，正在狼狈南逃。他想：“出击的时刻到了。”他来不及等待命令，就率领一排战士冲下山去。三十多个敌人迎面走来。指导员一下扑进敌人群中，飞起一脚，踢掉了为首一个匪军的卡宾枪。三班长袁义宝用冲锋枪对准敌人胸膛。走在前面的两个敌人，连忙回头摆手。接着，三十多个敌人都目瞪口呆地扔下枪，举起手来。
    还留在阵地的三排战士，看到一排捕捉俘虏，再也耐不住了。八班战士唐守智兴奋地叫嚷着：“俘虏老鼻子啦，赶快下山捉啊！”一股南逃的敌军碰到三排的勇士，扭头向侧翼山头乱跑。班长郭有荣带着机枪组，迅速插到山腰，拦头猛扫。三排长丁常富带领八班，乘势堵住沟口。四十多个美李军完全被卡住了。三排长用手比划着，让他们缴枪。第一个美国兵走出沟口，右腿跪地，右手撑地，侧着身躯，颤动的左手举起卡宾枪。三排长让美国兵站起来，美国兵诚惶诚恐地行了一个举手礼，又向三排长献上他的皮包。三排长拒绝了皮包，拍一拍美国兵的肩膀，让他不要害怕。事实教育了这个美国兵，他转过身来，大声呼喊，召唤他的同伴。二十五个美国兵和十多个李承晚伪兵，一个接一个地走出来，用类似的姿势放下了武器。
    在距沟口不远的地方，在这方圆数十里的山地里，麦克阿瑟的部下，这时进行着各种精采的投降表演。有的头下垂，两手高高举起；有的双膝跪倒，两手平举卡宾枪；有的头顶地，屁股朝天……
    麦克阿瑟所吹嘘的“运动战”，就这样毁灭在中国人民志愿部队英雄们的铁拳下了。
