　　Students of the World, Unite!
　　——Welcome the Executive Committee Meeting of the International Union of Students

　　The Executive Committee Meeting of the International Union of Students begins today in Beijing. The President of the International Union of Students, Mr. Grohman, all members of the Executive Committee, and student representatives from various countries attending this meeting arrived in Beijing on the 24th. Holding this meeting in China will undoubtedly further strengthen the ties and friendship between students worldwide and Chinese students. The Chinese people and Chinese students extend a warm welcome and respect to the student representatives from afar.

　　The International Union of Students is an important force in the struggle to defend world peace. In the four years since its establishment, the International Union of Students has consistently united students from around the world, making unremitting efforts under the principles of opposing imperialism and its running dogs and striving for lasting peace, national independence, and democratic education. This fighting principle, which aligns with the interests of students in all countries, has earned the support and love of democratic students worldwide and has grown stronger in constant struggle. When the International Union of Students was founded in August 1946, it had members from thirty-eight countries, totaling 1.5 million students. Now it has grown to 5 million students in seventy-one countries, becoming the most powerful organization of international students. The activities and struggles of the International Union of Students over the years have played an important role in promoting student movements in various countries and strengthening the struggle to defend world peace.

　　The International Union of Students has always actively supported the Chinese student movement, giving Chinese students great encouragement. During the Kuomintang rule, the International Union of Students continuously voiced its support for the patriotic anti-imperialist movement of Chinese students, condemning and protesting the reactionary acts of the Kuomintang reactionary government in persecuting Chinese students, which greatly enhanced the confidence of Chinese students in their struggle at that time. In addition, the International Union of Students has repeatedly raised funds for Chinese students and donated many gifts. From the day the International Union of Students was founded, Chinese students have been its enthusiastic supporters, warmly responding to and participating in all its activities and struggles. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese students, together with the Chinese people, won the great victory of the Chinese revolution and have recently launched a vigorous struggle to resist American aggression and aid Korea, which has encouraged students and people of all countries to strive for peace, national independence, and democratic education, thereby strengthening the influence and power of the International Union of Students. The fact that the International Union of Students is holding its Executive Committee meeting in China fully demonstrates the importance attached to Chinese youth and the student movement by democratic students around the world, and also reflects the close relationship between Chinese students and the International Union of Students. Through their representatives, Chinese students will fully exchange experiences in the student movement with student representatives from all over the world at this meeting, in order to further promote the struggle to defend world peace.

　　One of the main topics of this Executive Committee meeting of the International Union of Students is the student movements in colonial and dependent countries and the tasks of the International Union of Students. This will undoubtedly further promote student movements in colonial and dependent countries around the world, especially in Asian colonial and dependent countries, and will more broadly unite students around the world to fight for the defense of world peace. The current world situation has shown very clearly that the main enemy hindering the path of people and students in all countries towards peace, national independence, and democratic education is American imperialism. The conspiracy of American imperialism to launch a new war aims to enslave the people of all countries. American imperialism is particularly intensifying its attacks on the people of colonial and dependent countries, attempting to turn these countries into bases for aggressive war and using the manpower and resources of these countries to engage in military adventures. Therefore, the fierce struggle against aggressive war and defending world peace currently being waged in the world is also the struggle of the people of all countries to achieve national independence and democratic education. The fate of the people of colonial and dependent countries is closely related to this struggle. The people of colonial and dependent countries bear a glorious and arduous task in this struggle. In this great struggle, Chinese students, together with students from colonial and dependent countries and students from all over the world, must unite more closely to oppose the aggressive plans and war plans of American imperialism, and actively support the struggle of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world to resist aggression and defend peace, in order to completely defeat American imperialism – the common mortal enemy of peace-loving people and students of the world.

　　Here, we wish the Executive Committee meeting of the International Union of Students a victorious success, and wish the International Union of Students even more brilliant victories in the cause of uniting democratic students around the world!

### 世界学生团结起来——欢迎国际学联执行委员会会议

　　世界学生团结起来
    ——欢迎国际学联执行委员会会议
    国际学生联合会今日起在北京举行执行委员会会议。国际学生联合会主席格罗曼、执行委员会全体委员及列席这次会议的各国学生代表，已于二十四日到达了北京。这次会议在中国举行，无疑地将进一步加强世界学生与中国学生的联系和友谊。中国人民和中国学生对于远道而来的各国学生代表，表示热烈的欢迎与敬意。
    国际学生联合会是保卫世界和平斗争中的一支重要力量。在它成立以来的四年多时间中，国际学生联合会一直团结着世界学生，在反对帝国主义及其走狗，为争取持久和平、民族独立、民主教育而斗争的方针下，进行着不懈的努力。这种符合于一切国家学生利益的斗争方针，使得国际学生联合会得到了全世界民主学生的拥护与爱戴，并在不断的斗争中发展壮大起来。在一九四六年八月国际学生联合会成立时，它的会员只有三十八个国家中一百五十万学生，到现在已发展到七十一个国家中的五百万学生，而成为国际学生的最强大组织。国际学生联合会历年来的活动与斗争，对于推动各国学生运动、加强保卫世界和平的斗争，起了重要的作用。
    国际学生联合会一向积极支援中国学生运动，给中国学生以很大的鼓励。在国民党统治时期，国际学生联合会曾不断地声援中国学生的反帝爱国运动，对于国民党反动政府迫害中国学生的反动行为进行斥责和抗议，曾大大地增强了当时中国学生斗争的信心。此外，国际学生联合会曾多次为中国学生进行募捐，并赠送许多礼物。而中国学生自国际学生联合会成立的那一天起，就是它的热诚的拥护者，曾热烈地响应和参加了它的一切活动与斗争。中国学生在中国共产党领导之下，与中国人民在一起，争得了中国革命的伟大胜利，并在最近展开了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝斗争，对于各国学生与各国人民争取和平、民族独立与民主教育的斗争起了鼓舞作用，因而也就加强了国际学生联合会的影响与力量。这次国际学生联合会在中国举行执行委员会会议，就充分表现了世界民主学生对于中国青年学生和学生运动的重视，也反映了中国学生与国际学生联合会有着亲密的关系。中国学生必将通过自己的代表，在这次会议上，与世界各国学生代表，充分地交换学生运动的经验，以进一步推进保卫世界和平的斗争。
    这次国际学生联合会执行委员会会议的主要议题之一，是殖民地、附属国学生运动及国际学生联合会的任务。这无疑将进一步推动世界各处殖民地、附属国国家的学生运动，尤其是亚洲各殖民地、附属国国家的学生运动，并将使全世界学生更广泛地团结起来，为保卫世界和平而斗争。目前的世界形势，已经极其明显地显示出：横阻在各国人民与各国学生走向和平、民族独立与民主教育道路上的主要敌人，是美国帝国主义。美国帝国主义所正在进行的发动新战争的阴谋计划，其目的就是要奴役各国人民。美国帝国主义特别加紧对于殖民地和附属国人民的进攻，企图把这些国家变成侵略战争的基地，并利用这些国家的人力和资源来从事军事冒险。因此，目前在世界上所进行着的反对侵略战争保卫世界和平的激烈斗争，也就是各国人民争取民族独立与民主教育的斗争。殖民地附属国人民的命运是与这个斗争息息相关的。殖民地和附属国的人民在这个斗争中，担负了光荣而艰巨的任务。在这个伟大的斗争中，中国学生与各殖民地、附属国的学生以及全世界学生必须更加紧密地团结起来，反对美国帝国主义的侵略计划与战争计划，并积极支援中朝人民与世界人民反抗侵略、保卫和平的斗争，以彻底击败美国帝国主义——世界爱好和平人民与学生的共同死敌。
    在这里，我们预祝国际学生联合会执行委员会会议的胜利成功，并预祝国际学生联合会在团结全世界民主学生的事业上取得更辉煌的胜利！
