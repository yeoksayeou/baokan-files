Father Zhang Jizhong's Speech

Respected leaders, honored guests, fellow Catholics:

　　I feel very honored today because we have established the Tianjin Catholic Church Reform Movement Promotion Association. I am even more honored that our Tianjin Catholic Church's Three-Self Patriotic Movement has a good foundation. This undoubtedly requires thanks to the government's support and sponsorship. We should pay our respects to the government! On the other hand, it is also due to the great efforts of many enthusiastic Catholics who have overcome many difficulties to bring this about, and we should also pay our respects to them!

　　For many years, imperialism has used religion to invade our country. It has deceived many Chinese people through religion and anesthetized countless Catholics. Opening the history of imperialism's aggression over the past century, how many times have there been religious cases that were not caused by imperialism, and how many unequal treaties were signed without stipulating "the privilege of preaching"? They anesthetized us, told us to forget that we are Chinese people, and told us to forget our beloved motherland. I once thought: if the imperialist elements brought all the Chinese people into Catholicism, they would not need to expend a single bullet to turn our motherland into their colony, allowing them to oppress, exploit, and slaughter us. In the old society, no one enlightened us or taught us, but today is different. We have a wise leader in Chairman Mao, and we have the People's Government. We have turned ourselves over, so we have today's victory. Catholics, we must be even more determined to break away from imperialism, and seize the power to control the church in China from the hands of the imperialist demons. We are doing this to love our free, independent, democratic, and beautiful motherland, and to love the Catholic Church in China.

　　We must be vigilant because the remnants of imperialism and secret agents still want to sow discord, undermine our unity, and even try to use us to carry out aggression against the Chinese people. Imperialism sees that it is about to collapse, but it still wants to "fight like a cornered beast." Why is this? Mayor Huang Jing explained very clearly at the Tianjin Municipal People's Representative Enlarged Conference: "We are liberated, we have won victory. How much have we changed in these two years of victory? We have indeed turned ourselves over, everything is indeed getting better, and we have entered a rational, happy, and confident life. But are these counter-revolutionaries willing to accept this? They are not willing, they want to overthrow us, they want to sabotage us, they want to restore the old order, and drag us back to the painful life we had before. Therefore, the more the people win, the more unwilling they are, and they want to carry out counter-revolution..." That's right! Isn't it because imperialist elements were obstructing us from the beginning that the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Catholic Church in Tianjin was progressing so slowly?

　　Finally, I hope that the Chinese priests and Catholics in Tianjin will unite closely, resolutely fight against imperialism, and completely expel imperialist elements from our country. We must stand on our own land and live a happy life under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao.

### 张济众神甫讲话

　　张济众神甫讲话各位首长，各位来宾，各位教友：
    我今天感到很光荣，因为我们成立了天津市天主教革新运动促进会，更光荣的是我们天津市天主教的三自革新运动有了很好的基础，这无疑地要感谢政府的支持与赞助。我们应当向政府致敬！另一方面也是由于多位热心的教友尽了最大努力，克服了许多困难而促成的，我们也应当向他们致敬！
    多少年来帝国主义利用宗教侵略我国，它通过宗教欺骗了不少中国人民，麻醉了无数的教友。打开帝国主义近百年来的侵略史，多少次的教案，那一次不是帝国主义造成的，那一次不平等条约的签订，不是注明要有“传教的特权”呢？他们麻醉我们，叫我们忘记是中国人民，叫我们忘记我们亲爱的祖国，我曾这样想：帝国主义分子，如果将中国人民全都弄到天主教里来，那就不用消耗它一粒子弹，就会变我们的祖国为它的殖民地，任它们压迫、剥削、宰割。在旧社会，无人启发我们，教导我们，但是今天不同了，我们有了英明的领袖毛主席，有了人民政府，我们翻身了，所以才有了今天的胜利。教友们，我们要下更大的决心与帝国主义割断关系，从帝国主义的魔手里夺回在中国的掌教权，我们这样作是为了爱我们自由、独立、民主、美丽的祖国，是为了爱中国的天主教。
    我们要提高警惕，因为帝国主义的残余分子还要和特务一起，挑拨离间，破坏我们的团结，还想利用我们进行对中国人民的侵略。帝国主义眼看就要垮台了，但是它还要“困兽犹斗”，这是为什么呢？黄敬市长在天津市市区各界人民代表扩大会议上讲得非常清楚：“我们解放了，我们胜利了，这胜利的两年我们变化得多大呢？我们的确是翻身了，的确是样样都好起来了，我们进入了合理的幸福的充满了信心的生活来了。可是这些反革命他们甘心吗？他们不甘心的，他们要推翻我们，要破坏我们，他们要复辟，要把我们拉回到以前那样痛苦的生活里去。所以人民越胜利，他们越不甘心，他们要反革命…………。”对的！起初我们天津市天主教的三自革新运动所以推动得很慢，还不是帝国主义分子在从中阻挠吗？
    最后，希望天津市的中国神甫和教友们紧密的团结起来，坚决地与帝国主义进行斗争，将帝国主义分子完全驱逐出我们国土，我们要站在自己的国土上，在毛主席的英明领导下过着幸福的生活。
