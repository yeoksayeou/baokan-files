The Northeast Xi'an Coal Mine Shi Yuhai Safety Production Team Challenges Northeast and National Coal Miners to Launch a Safety Production Competition to Welcome the "May Day" Labor Day

    The Xi'an Coal Mine Shi Yuhai Safety Production Team, a banner of safety production in the Northeast coal mining area with four years of accident-free operation, issued a letter of challenge on March 20, launching a safety production competition to the Northeast and national coal miners. The original letter is as follows:

    In order to deepen the patriotic competition, welcome the "May Day" Labor Day, and further improve coal mine safety production, our team hereby proposes a friendly competition to our brothers in the Northeast and national coal mines. The conditions are as follows:

    1. Guarantee that the entire team has no serious injury or death accidents due to responsibility throughout the year. Maintain a monthly attendance rate of 92% (the average last year was 91%). Pay attention to improving labor organization where possible. Guarantee balanced output, complete production tasks on time (monthly, quarterly), and strive to exceed 5% for the whole year.

    2. Comply with technical operating procedures, ensure engineering quality, and achieve standardized operations—layered longwall method. Where geological conditions permit, use coal cutting machines as much as possible, and strengthen roof and gas management.

    3. Strictly abide by labor discipline, safety regulations, and various production systems. Hold a production meeting once a week and a trade union team meeting twice a month to study safety issues in the workplace, check work progress and labor protection issues, and promptly criticize and commend.

    4. Launch cultural, technical, and political studies. Strive to eliminate illiteracy by more than 40% throughout the year. Read the newspaper before literacy class, listen to a political class once a week, improve awareness, and consolidate the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic labor competition. Learn mechanical operation methods and drilling and blasting techniques to maximize mechanical efficiency (wind picks were not used in the first quarter due to insufficient air volume, used 40% in the second quarter, and 50% in the third quarter), and the recovery rate exceeded the 10% stipulated by the Northeast Coal Mine Administration.

　　东北西安煤矿施玉海安全生产小组       
    向东北和全国煤矿工人挑战       
    迎接“五一”劳动节开展安全生产竞赛
    四年未出事故的东北区煤矿安全生产的旗帜——西安煤矿施玉海安全生产小组，三月二十日发出挑战书，向东北和全国煤矿工人发起安全生产竞赛。原信如下：
    为了深入爱国主义竞赛，迎接“五一”劳动节，更进一步搞好煤矿安全生产，我们小组特向东北及全国煤矿弟兄提出友谊竞赛。条件如下：
    一、保证全小组全年不出重伤、死亡责任事故。每月出勤率保持百分之九十二（去年平均百分之九十一）。注意在可能条件下改进劳动组织。保证产量平衡，按期（每月、每季）完成生产任务，争取全年超过百分之五。
    二、遵守技术操作规程，保证工程质量，做到正规作业——分层长壁式。在地质条件许可下，尽量使用截煤机，并加强顶板管理与瓦斯管理。
    三、严格遵守劳动纪律、保安规程以及各种生产制度。每星期开一次生产会议，每月召开两次工会小组会，研究作业场所的安全问题，检查工作情况及劳动保护问题，及时批评、表扬。
    四、展开文化、技术、政治学习。争取全年消灭文盲百分之四十以上。上识字课前读报，每周听一次政治课，提高觉悟，巩固抗美援朝爱国主义劳动竞赛。学习机械操作方法及打眼放炮技术，发挥机械效能（风镐因第一季风量不足未使用，第二季使用百分之四十，第三季使用百分之五十），回采率超过东北煤矿管理局规定的百分之十。
