　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: The Japanese government promulgated ordinances regarding local elections on April 3rd. Elections for administrative officials and members of city, ward, town, and village councils will be held nationwide on April 23rd, and elections for governors and members of the assemblies of To (Tokyo), Do, Fu, and Prefectures will be held on April 30th. The main political parties are conducting election campaigns.

　　In its election campaign, the Japanese Communist Party once again put forward the proposal for a comprehensive peace treaty to be concluded by the four major powers—the Soviet Union, China, the United States, and Great Britain—based on the Potsdam Declaration. The JCP also opposes rearmament and the establishment of military bases in Japan. In the economic sphere, the JCP advocates for all-out land reform, the prohibition of war production, and the unrestricted expansion of peaceful industries. The leading body of the Socialist Party rejected the JCP's just proposal for joint struggle, but advocates for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty, and opposes rearmament and the establishment of military bases in Japan.

　　The Liberal Party, led by Yoshida, continues to advocate a separate peace treaty followed by the stationing of "United Nations" forces in Japan, and Japan's participation in "world organizations" to obtain so-called "collective security." In other words, it advocates rearmament to be driven by the United States. The National Democratic Party, colluding with the Liberal Party, also shamelessly advocates a separate peace treaty and participation in "any collective security system."

　　The various opposition parties advocating a comprehensive peace treaty have formed a united front against the Liberal Party in many places. Sixty-four progressive organizations in Tokyo have jointly nominated Professor Shutatsu Ide of Tokyo University as a candidate for Governor of Tokyo. Ide resigned from Tokyo University on March 23rd to participate in the election.

　　The Yoshida reactionary government is intensifying repressive measures to obstruct the election activities of the Japanese people.

　　日本将在本月下旬举行地方选举
    日共在竞选中提出全面媾和主张
    在野党派在许多地方结成统一战线反对自由党
    【新华社十一日讯】东京消息：日本政府已于四月三日公布关于地方选举的法令。全国将于四月二十三日举行市、区、町、村行政官及议员的选举，四月三十日举行都（东京）、道、府县知事及议员的选举。各主要政党正进行竞选运动。
    日本共产党在竞选中再度提出由苏、中、美、英四大国根据波茨坦公告订立全面和约的主张。日共并反对重新武装与在日本建立军事基地。在经济方面，日共主张全力进行土地改革；禁止战争生产，无限制扩大和平工业。社会党领导机关拒绝了日共关于共同斗争的正当提议，但主张订立全面和约，反对重新武装与在日本建立军事基地。
    以吉田为首的自由党则继续鼓吹单独媾和后“联合国”驻军日本，并由日本参加“世界组织”以取得所谓“集体安全”。换言之，就是重新武装以供美国驱策。与自由党狼狈为奸的国民民主党，也无耻地主张单独媾和与参加“任何的集体安全制度”。
    主张全面媾和的各在野党派，已在许多地方结成反对自由党的统一战线。东京的六十四个进步团体业已联合提名东京大学的出隆教授为东京知事候选人。出隆已于三月二十三日向东京大学辞职，以便参加竞选。
    吉田反动政府正在加紧镇压措施，阻碍日本人民的选举活动。
