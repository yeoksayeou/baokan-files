　　Mudanjiang Textile Factory
    Begins to Value Employee Health and Improve Welfare Work

To the Editors:

    The criticism made by Comrade Jian Chong in the "Reader's Letters" page of your newspaper on February 14th regarding our factory's neglect of employee health during the patriotic production emulation drive is essentially factual. We have now made improvements and are reporting the progress as follows:

    In the second month of our factory's patriotic production emulation drive, production in various workshops stagnated. The reason was the high number of absences, the majority of which were due to colds. After discovering this situation, the union and the administrative welfare section conducted an in-depth investigation. It was found that the reasons for workers catching colds were, on the one hand, that the heating pipes in the dormitories were too long, the heating cooled down and did not transmit effectively, and the dormitories could not maintain a constant temperature. Secondly, the club's heating was not turned on in time, and the rooms were still cold when the workers were studying; by the time the rooms were warm, the study was over. In addition, the temperature in the toilets was also lower than in the workshops. Workers easily caught colds when they went to the club to eat and to the toilets in single clothes. After inspection, the union cooperated with the administration to strengthen health education for the workers. The administrative leadership immediately installed heating pipes and thermometers in the single dormitories, toilets, etc., stipulated the time for turning on the heating, and assigned the boiler room to be responsible for timely inspections. Cotton door curtains were hung at the entrance of the club to prevent cold wind from entering. Disinfection and other sanitary facilities were carried out in the dormitories. In the spinning workshop, sprayers were repaired to increase humidity and reduce yarn breakage.

    The stagnation of the production emulation drive in the first half of January also shows that our understanding of caring for the health of workers was insufficient, and we did not discover the problem in time, which led to a serious impact on production. This is something that deserves our deep reflection. This lesson has made us deeply realize that we must value and do a good job in employee welfare, improve employee health, in order to steadily promote the production emulation drive.

### 牡丹江纺织厂  开始重视职工健康改进福利工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　牡丹江纺织厂
    开始重视职工健康改进福利工作编辑同志：
    二月十四日贵报《读者来信专页》所发表建崇同志对我厂在爱国主义生产竞赛运动中不注意职工健康的批评，基本上是事实。我们现已进行改进并将经过情况报告如下：
    我厂爱国主义生产竞赛运动的第二个月，各车间生产情形呈现停滞，原因是缺勤人数较多，其中以患感冒病而缺勤的最多。我们发现这种情况后，即由工会和行政福利科进行深入了解。当时发现工友感冒的原因一方面是由于宿舍暖气管子过长，暖气冷却透不过来，宿舍不能保持一定温度。其次是俱乐部的暖气没有按时开放，工友们学习时屋子还是冷的；等到屋子暖和时，学习也完了。此外，厕所的温度也较工场内低。工友们穿着单衣上俱乐部吃饭和上厕所时很容易感冒。经检查后，工会配合行政加强对工友进行卫生教育。行政领导上立即在独身宿舍、厕所等按装了暖气管子和寒暑表，规定放暖气的时间，并由锅炉房负责按时检查。俱乐部进门处挂上了棉门帘，以防寒风侵入。在宿舍内进行了消毒和其他卫生设备。在细纱车间修理了喷雾器，提高湿度，减少了断头。
    一月上半月生产竞赛停滞现象的发生，也说明了我们对爱护工人身体健康的认识还不够，没有及时发现问题，以致发展到严重影响生产。这是值得我们深刻检讨的。由于这一教训，使我们深刻地体会到：必须重视和办好职工福利工作，增进职工身体健康，才能使生产竞赛稳步开展。
