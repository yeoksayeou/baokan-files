How to Improve Earthwork Efficiency in Water Conservancy Projects?
Meng Xin

In the water conservancy projects of 1950, the earthwork alone amounted to more than 419 million cubic meters. In 1951, there will still be more than 400 million cubic meters of earthwork to be done. Such a large amount of earthwork, except for some areas and individual sections where modernized tools have been used, the vast majority will still be completed manually using extremely simple tools. If each person completes an average of 1.5 cubic meters per day, the entire project will require 280 million workdays to complete. Therefore, we can imagine that if the work efficiency can be increased to an average of 3 cubic meters per person per day, then 140 million workdays can be saved. Therefore, how to improve earthwork efficiency is indeed a major issue worthy of our attention and discussion.

We know that there are many factors affecting work efficiency in earthwork. For example, the leadership of the construction, the layout of the construction site, the softness and hardness of the soil, the quality of the tools, the strength of the physical strength, the level of mood, the method of work, and the proficiency of the technology all affect the size of the work efficiency and should be carefully studied. Now, only the three most important issues are discussed.

  I. How to Improve the Morale of the Laborers

The morale of the laborers is the most important factor affecting work efficiency, and the construction experience of the past year has fully confirmed this point. In 1950, the average work efficiency in various regions was mostly between 2 and 3 cubic meters, but in Pingyuan Province, Xia Chongwen, who did 27.65 cubic meters of soil per day, Zhao Jixian, who did 29.7 cubic meters of soil, and Yuan Qiangtou, who did 46 cubic meters of soil, appeared continuously. There are many similar outstanding examples in other places. Their work efficiency is several times or even dozens of times higher than that of ordinary laborers. The models who created these records may have stronger physical strength and more proficient work skills, but in each region, the working methods, tools used, and soil dug are basically the same as those of ordinary laborers. The main reason for achieving such results is the level of work enthusiasm. Therefore, thoroughly mobilizing the laborers to eliminate the ideological concerns of the laborers and motivating their work enthusiasm is the main key to improving work efficiency.

What ideological obstacles and concerns exist among the laborers? We know that some laborers do not have a correct understanding of the project they are doing, and believe that the project is to be done by the government, and has nothing to do with their own personal interests, or even harmful, so their morale is not high and their work is not active. Some do not understand the wage policy and do not believe in the principle of paying according to the volume of work and getting more for doing more. Therefore, there is a mentality of "working or not, it's still two and a half jin" and muddling through. In addition, the method of grouping and calculating work is unfair and unreasonable, afraid that long working hours will affect spring plowing production, and concerns about family life are all reasons that affect the morale of the laborers. In view of the above situation, we should first carry out in-depth mobilization before construction, combined with the specific local conditions. For example, for the people along the river, we can mobilize them with the slogan "Controlling water for ourselves, everyone contributes." For the people in areas far from the river, we can mobilize them with the spirit of "Farmers all over the world are one family." For the people who rarely suffer from floods, we can mobilize them with slogans such as "Low-lying areas do not harvest, high-lying areas worry." For the people who will temporarily suffer some disasters due to dike construction and river management, we can still persuade them with the principle of "Small interests obey large interests." In short, we must carry out work in accordance with the government's policies and combine them with the interests of the masses, so that it becomes a conscious action, in order to give play to their work enthusiasm.

Secondly, the project tasks, engineering methods, and project requirements should be clearly explained to the laborers, so that the laborers can understand the work thoroughly and ensure that they "finish the work early and go home early." However, in areas where earthwork and ramming work have not been separately grouped, it is necessary to simultaneously put forward the slogan of "Guaranteeing quality" to avoid deviations; do not repeatedly increase the tasks, and try to avoid helping work, because helping work will not only affect the work enthusiasm of the high-efficiency groups, but also will help the dependence of the low-efficiency groups. The piecework wage policy of "paying according to the volume of work and getting more for doing more" can be fully discussed and deliberated by the laborers, on the one hand, so that the laborers can clearly understand the wage policy, and on the other hand, how to specifically implement the policy and what grouping method is convenient for implementing this policy to everyone can also be solved together.

Finally, we should do a good job in the mutual aid organization of farming and planting on behalf of the laborers, and the necessary measures for protecting homes and preventing bandits. In the disaster areas, we should also provide appropriate resettlement and relief for family members or organize sideline production so that they have no worries.

After the start of construction, on the one hand, we must strengthen patriotic education on resisting the United States and aiding Korea, and expose and be vigilant against the rumors and sabotage of bandits and special agents at any time to enlighten the laborers' consciousness. On the other hand, the model figures, especially the model groups and model teams, should be commended in a timely manner. At the same time, we should try our best to achieve the work of timely acceptance and timely distribution of grain, not only to distribute to the teams and groups according to the volume of work, but also to distribute to individuals according to their labor, so that the laborers can truly recognize the wage policy of paying according to the volume of work and getting more for doing more, in order to encourage and motivate the work enthusiasm of the laborers.

  II. Tool Issues

The requirements for tools are suitability and sufficiency. At this stage, the tools we can prepare, purchase, and use are only bulldozers, carrying baskets, lifting baskets, shovels, mills, and foreign mills. These tools must be required to be useful and easy to use. Useful tools can reduce damage, and easy-to-use tools can save effort and produce work. When Yancheng, Henan, was under key construction last winter, the tools were not easy to use, which affected the work efficiency. However, the laborers in Zouli Village, Yingshang County, achieved higher results because the iron mills were sharp and useful, the carrying poles were light and soft, and the soil baskets were also light and handy. This is worthy of emulation by all regions.

According to the construction experience of various regions, in areas where collective work is carried out, in order to achieve "people and baskets are not idle", there must be a part of mobile tools in addition to the practical tools. Moreover, the tools used vary according to the distance of soil transportation and the dryness and wetness of the soil. Preparations must be made in advance so as not to affect work efficiency. According to the experience of northern Jiangsu, it is best to prepare two sets of tools. If the ground is flat, the distance is long, the soil is dry, and the weather is sunny, use a cart to push; if the distance is short, the weather is rainy and muddy, and the dike is high and the pond is deep, use a carrying pole to carry. The Yellow River has similar experience. Carrying baskets are good for short distances, and carts are good for long distances. However, in areas where there is no habit of pushing carts, it is best to use relay soil transportation for long-distance soil transportation. According to the experience of laborers in northern Anhui transporting soil last winter, the efficiency of two people relaying soil transportation is higher than that of one person transporting soil independently. Therefore, we should try our best to prepare more tools.

  III. Working Methods and Grouping

There are basically two types of working methods now: one is individual self-loading and self-transporting, and the other is collective division of labor and cooperation. Collective division of labor and cooperation means that several people are formed into a group, and the work is divided into two parts: soil loading and soil transportation. According to the construction experience of the Huai River last winter, the ratio of the number of people loading and transporting soil should be allocated as follows depending on the soil quality and distance:

Which of these two methods is better is still inconclusive. According to the experience of the Yellow River over the years, self-loading and self-transporting can best give play to labor efficiency, because this method uses the simplest tools, the movements are flexible, and there is no delay in work. At the same time, in the action of self-loading and self-transporting, there is loading and transporting, and the movements are changed, which can reduce labor intensity and make the work lasting. This is the reason why the work efficiency of long-distance relay soil transportation is higher than that of independent soil transportation.

However, the working method of individual self-loading and self-transporting should not develop in the direction of dividing soil ponds for individuals to create personal records, but should develop in the direction of improving collective work efficiency. That is to say, the entire project should be divided into sections according to administrative units (county, district, village), and combined into teams or groups according to voluntary methods for acceptance, distribution of funds, and wages. The teams or groups should then be rated and distributed according to the strength of each laborer, which is very convenient in terms of construction leadership, acceptance of funds and grain, and even the administrative issues of laborers' meals, accommodation, and distribution of firewood and grain supplies. Especially when the project is large and a large number of laborers are mobilized, collective work is even more necessary. Therefore, despite the difference between collective division of labor and self-loading and self-transporting in working methods, the grouping method of voluntary combination and distribution of dividends according to labor should be consistent. Moreover, the number of people in this grassroots team or group is best between fifteen and thirty, and should not be too small, because too small a group will increase the number of miscellaneous workers, increase the proportion of administrative personnel, and reduce the proportion of full-time workers, which will affect the reduction of overall work efficiency.

In addition, some rules have been tested in various places in the method of soil transportation, which are worth noting. In the winter repair project in Fuyang, northern Anhui last year, it was tested that the work efficiency of one person carrying soil is one-third higher than that of two people carrying soil. The test of carrying and lifting by the laborers' brigade in Baoyi District, Shouxian County this spring also came to the same conclusion. The result of the test in Hebei Province is that it is best to carry soil with a soil basket within 40 meters of the transportation distance, the efficiency of pushing a cart and carrying soil with a soil basket is roughly equal from 40 meters to 80 meters, and if the transportation distance is from 80 meters to 200 meters, the efficiency of pushing soil with a cart is the highest. Regardless of the long or short distance, the efficiency of two people carrying a basket is always the lowest. According to the test in Fuyang Prefecture, when the transportation distance is too long, the efficiency of two people relaying soil transportation is higher than that of one person transporting soil independently. Combining these situations, we know that in areas where there is a habit or conditions for pushing carts, we should advocate carrying soil with soil baskets when the soil transportation distance is short, and we should try to use carts to push soil when the distance is long. In areas where there is no habit or conditions for pushing carts, we should try to advocate carrying soil with soil baskets. When the transportation distance is too long, we should organize relay carrying and use less or no method of carrying by two people to improve work efficiency.

In addition, the construction leading agencies should pay attention to cultivating model teams and groups with high work efficiency, so that the personnel allocation, organization, work skills, the method of digging pits and taking soil, and the round trip up and down the road are improved to a reasonable state, and then go to various construction sections for mobile demonstration education to break through one point and promote the overall situation, so that work efficiency can be improved. In order to achieve the goal of improving earthwork efficiency and saving more labor for agricultural production, the construction leading agencies should pay close attention to this issue and study it carefully.

　　在水利工程中怎样提高土工效率？
　　孟新
    在一九五○年的水利工程中，土工一项即完成四亿一千九百余万公方，一九五一年仍有四亿多公方土工要做，这样大量的土工，除部分地区，个别工段已使用近代化工具进行工作而外，其余的很大部分仍要以人力使用极简单的工具来完成。如果每人每日以平均做一点五公方计算，全部工程就需要二亿八千万个工作日才能完成。因此我们可以想像得出如能将工作效率提高到每人每日平均做三公方，那末即可节省一亿四千万个工作日。所以如何提高土工工作效率，确是值得我们注意研究讨论的一个大问题。
    我们知道，在土工中影响工作效率的条件很多。比如施工的领导，工地的布置，土质的软硬、工具的好坏，体力的强弱，情绪的高低，工作的方式，技术的生熟等等，都足以影响到工作效率的大小，都应该注意研究。现在只就其中三个最重要的问题，提出加以讨论。
  一、如何提高民工的工作情绪
    民工工作情绪的高低，是影响工作效率的最主要一环，一年多来的施工经验，已可充分证实这一点。一九五○年各地平均工作效率，多在二到三公方，可是在平原省就曾连续出现了每天做二七·六五公方土的夏崇文，二九·七公方土的赵继宪和四六公方土的原墙头。这类的突出例子，在其他地方也很多。他们的工作效率竟比较一般民工超出几倍甚至十几倍。创造这些纪录的模范们，他们的体力可能比较强，工作的技术可能比较熟练，但在各该地区来说，与一般民工的工作方法、使用工具、所挖土壤等条件，都大体是一样的。其所以获得这样成绩的主要原因，还是在于工作热情的高低，因此深入动员民工解除民工思想上所存在的顾虑，激励他们工作的积极性，是提高工作效率的主要关键。
    在民工中间存在那些思想障碍和顾虑呢？我们知道，有的民工对所做工程认识不正确，认为工程是政府要做的，与自己没什么切身利害关系，甚或有害，因而情绪不高，工作不积极。有的对工资政策不了解，对按方给资、多做多得不相信。因而存在着“干不干二斤半”等混日子的思想。此外，编组计工的办法不公平合理，怕做工时间长影响春耕生产，牵挂家庭生活等，都是影响民工做工情绪的原因。针对上述情况，因此首先我们应该在施工之前，结合地方具体情况，进行深入动员。比如对于沿河人民就可以“治水为自己、大家出力气”的口号来动员，对于离河较远地区的人民可以“天下农民是一家”的精神来动员，而对于很少遭受水患的人民则可以“洼地不收、高地担忧”等口号来动员，对于因修堤治河暂时要受到部分灾患的人民仍可以“小利服从大利”的道理来说服。总之必须根据政府的政策并结合群众利害来进行工作，使之成为自觉的行动，才能发挥其工作的积极性。
    其次对于工程任务，工程作法，工程要求，都应给民工作详确交待，使民工对工作摸住底，并保证“早完工早回家”。但在土工、硪工未分开编组的地区，则须同时提出“保证质量”的口号，以免发生偏差；不要一再增加任务，并尽量避免帮工，因为帮工不但要影响工作效率高的组的工作积极性，而且会助长工作效率低的组的依赖性。对于“按方给资，多做多得”的计件工资政策可以让民工充分讨论酝酿，一方面使民工对工资政策可以清楚了解，另方面对于政策的如何具体执行，用什么编组的方式，才便于使这个政策贯彻到每一个人身上等等，也可以一并得到解决。
    最后，应做好民工的代耕代种的互助组织，和保家防匪的必要措施，在灾区并要对家属予以适当的安置救济或组织副业生产，使其无后顾之忧。
    而在开工之后，一方面要加强抗美援朝爱国主义教育，随时揭破并警惕匪特的造谣生事，以启发民工的自觉，另方面要对于模范人物，尤其是模范组，模范队应及时的进行表扬，同时要尽量做到及时收方，及时发粮的工作，不仅要按方发给队、组，而且要按劳发给个人，使民工真正认清按方给资多做多得的工资政策，以鼓舞激励民工的工作情绪。
  二、工具问题
    对工具的要求是合用、够用。在现阶段我们所能准备购置使用的工具，只有推土车、担筐、抬筐、锹、铣、洋铣等数种，对这些工具一定要求要件件顶用、好用。顶用的工具可少损坏，好用的工具可省力出活。河南郾城去冬重点施工时，工具不好用，影响了工作效率。而颍上县邹李村民工，因铁铣锐利顶用，扁担轻软，土筐也轻巧，因而获得了较高成绩，这是值得各地效法的。
    经各地施工经验，在集体作工的地区，要想作到“人筐两不闲”，就一定要在实用的工具之外，还要有一部分机动的工具。而且运土距离远近不同，泥土干湿不同，所用工具也因之不同，必须预有准备，才不致影响工作效率。根据苏北的经验，最好是准备两套工具，如在平地，距离远，土质干，天晴则用小车推；距离近，阴雨泥泞，堤高塘深，则用担子挑。黄河也有类似经验，短距离以挑篮为好，长距离以小车为好。但在没有推车习惯的地区，远距离运土时最好用接力运土法。根据去年冬天皖北民工运土的经验，两人接力运土比一人独立运土的效率要高。因此工具应尽量设法多准备一些。
  三、工作的方式与编组
    工作方式，现在基本上有两种：一是个人自装自运。一是集体分工合作。集体分工合作即若干人编成一组，工作时再分为装土运土两部分进行工作。据淮河去冬施工经验，装运土人数之比例因土质距离不同，最好作如下分配：
    这两种方法，究竟那种方法更好，现在尚无定论。根据黄河几年来的经验，认为自装自运最能发挥劳动效力，因为这种方式使用的工具最简单，动作灵敏，不误工。同时自装自运的动作中，有装有运，动作有变换，可以减轻劳动强度，工作可以持久。远距离接力运土的工作效率高于独立运土的工作效率的原因即在此。
    不过个人自装自运的工作方式，不应该向个人划土塘创造个人纪录的方向发展，而应向提高集体工作效率的方向发展。这就是说整个工程应依行政单位（县、区、村）划分工段，依自愿方式结合为队或组，进行收方、发资，队或组之间再按每个民工劳力的强弱来评分分资，这样在施工领导上，收方发粮上，甚至民工吃饭住宿以及领发柴粮等物资供应的事务问题上，都有很多方便。尤其在工程规模很大，动员民工很多的情形下，集体工作更显得必要。所以尽管工作方式有集体分工与自装自运的不同，而自愿结合按劳分红的编组方式，则应一致。而且这种基层队或组的人数，最好是在十五人至三十人之间，不宜过少，因为编组过小，将使杂工增多，事务管理人员比重增大，正工比重减少影响到总的工作效率的减低。
    另外在运土的方法上，近来各地试验出一些规律值得注意。皖北阜阳去年冬修工程中，即曾试验出一人担土比两人抬土的工作效率高三分之一。今春寿县保义区民工大队对担抬的试验，亦得出了同样的结论。河北省试验的结果是运距在四十公尺以内用土篮子担为最好，四十公尺至八十公尺用小车推和土篮子担的效率大致相等，若运距是八十公尺到二百公尺则以车推土的效率为最高，不论长距离短距离二人抬筐的效率总是最低的。另据阜阳专区试验，运距过长时，两人接力运土比一人独力运土效率高。综合这些情况，我们知道，有推小车习惯或条件的地区，运土距离较短时应提倡用土篮子担土，距离较长时则应尽量用小车推土，而在没有推小车的习惯或条件的地区，则应尽量提倡用土篮子担土，运距过长时，则组织接力担运，少用或不用两人抬的办法，以提高工作效率。
    除此而外，各施工领导机关注意培养工作效率高的模范队、组，使其人员的配备组织、工作技巧的熟练，挖坑取土的方法，运土来回的上下道等方面都使之改进到合理的境地，然后再到各个工段作巡回示范教育。以突破一点，推动全面，使工作效率达到提高的目的。为了达到提高土工工作效率，以节省更多劳力投入农业生产，各施工领导机关对这一问题，应切实注意研究。（附图表）
