　　In the past year or two, many works defending world peace and promoting internationalism have appeared in Soviet literature and art. In literature, we first notice poetry. Soviet poetry has a glorious fighting tradition on its path of development. The great poet Mayakovsky once said, "Poetry is our flag and our bomb." Mayakovsky, like Gorky, also visited the United States. In his famous collection of poems, "I Discover America," he angrily denounced the big capitalists who oppressed and exploited the people and sharply satirized the American way of life.

　　The poet, novelist, and playwright Simonov has written many poems full of internationalist spirit in recent years. His collection of poems, "Friends and Enemies," won the Stalin First Class Literary Prize in 1948. In these seventeen poems, he expresses sincere love for international friends and expresses unparalleled hatred for class enemies.

　　The poet Bezymensky, known for depicting the life of the Soviet Communist Youth League, is still as enthusiastic and young as before. In recent years, he has also written many poems supporting world peace and attacking warmongers, which were compiled and published as a collection of poems, "Angry Lines of Poetry."

　　Many other Soviet poets have also written many works defending world peace and exposing the ugliness of capitalist society. For example, Surkov (collection of poems "Give Peace to the World"), Marshak (satirical short poems and long poem "Guarding Peace"), Oshanin (collection of poems "Children of All Nations"), Bazhan (collection of poems "Impressions of England"), Tursun-Zade (collection of poems "Indian Ballad"), Gribachev and Kitovich (some poems dedicated to the Korean people), as well as the works of Chalov, Mikhalkov, Prokofiev, and Dolmatovsky.

　　In the field of reportage, the reports of Soviet literary and art workers on New China and People's Korea should be pointed out first. For example, Simonov's "Fighting China," Soviet painter Fenognov's "In New China," and journalist Chichitkina's "Liberated China," etc. Reports on the construction of democratic Korea and the American imperialist aggression against Korea include Birventsev's "In Korea" and the recently published Bourkingko's "Korea in Flames" ("Spark" Literary Series), etc.

　　In order to defend peace and uphold the truth, Soviet writers also frequently write sharp political essays. The most outstanding of these is Ehrenburg. His collection of political essays was published in two volumes last year, "Struggle for Peace" and "Hope for Peace." Other writers, such as Fadeyev, Tikhonov, Sholokhov, Fedin, Pavlenko, and Polevoy, also frequently write political essays for the Soviet press.

　　As for theatrical works and theatrical activities, in recent years Soviet playwrights have frequently paid attention to the themes of supporting people's democracy and defending world peace. The most familiar creations in this regard to our Chinese readers are "The Russian Question" (Simonov), "The Voice of America" (Lavrenyov), "In a Certain Country" (Virta), "I Want to Go Home" (Mikhalkov), etc. These plays have been constantly staged in Moscow and other cities recently.

　　At the end of November last year, the Moscow Pushkin Memorial Theater premiered Klotkov's new work "John - Warrior of Peace," which is a play depicting the fighting life of the famous American black singer Paul Robeson. Directed by Vanning, and with Nazvanov, Honored Artist of the Russian Republic, playing John (Robeson), this play set a very high record in the number of performances in this theater season (1950-1951). In creating this role, Nazvanov not only achieved success in action and singing, but more importantly, he was able to truly express the strong, brave, calm, and enthusiastic character of a peace warrior. The play ends with shouting "Stalin - Peace," "Stalin - Peace," and each ending caused prolonged cheers and applause from the audience.

　　Other plays in this area include: Bogotin's "Missouri Waltz," Mujiwani's "People of Good Will," "Prague Belongs to Me in the End" (Briyakovsky), which depicts the life of the Czech revolutionary fighter Fučík, "Life Begins Again" (Sobko), which depicts democratic Germany, and the operetta "The Wind of Freedom" (composed by Dunaevsky) with the theme of the peace signature movement. These plays have also been frequently performed in Moscow theaters recently.

　　In recent years, Antonov, a writer famous for his short stories, recently wrote a film script entitled "Peace Envoy." The central character of this script is a collective farm woman, labor hero Nikanorova, who once went abroad to participate in international women's conferences. Her son sacrificed himself during the patriotic war in order to save the brothers in Europe. The Leningrad Film Studio is currently filming this film.

　　Soviet musicians are also constantly striving for the world peace movement. First of all, several famous choruses should be mentioned, such as Prokofiev's "Guarding Peace," Mannevich's "Defending Peace," and Kormalyov's "Free China," etc.

　　We can cite many, many mass songs with the theme of striving for peace. These songs are not only very popular among the Soviet people, but also widely spread to countries all over the world. For example, Shostakovich's "Song of Peace" (lyrics by Dolmatovsky), Moratli's "Song of Peace Warriors" (lyrics by Halitdonov) and "Moscow - Beijing" (lyrics by Virshinin), Novikov's "Song of Peace" (lyrics by Oshanin) and "Song of Democratic Youth" (lyrics by Oshanin), Dulikov's "We Support Peace" (lyrics by Chalov) and "The Great Army of Peace" (lyrics by Rublyov), Bely's "Defending Peace" (lyrics by Frinkel), etc.

　　Soviet literature and art are the most advanced literature and art in the world. From the above brief reports, we can see how Soviet literary and art workers are fighting to uphold the truth, defend and insist on world peace when the savage American and British imperialists are currently carrying out crazy massacres against the Korean people, and when warmongers Truman, Marshall, Dulles, etc. are instigating new wars, and when war is threatening all mankind and children in the world. But we know that the Soviet people are not ordinary "pacifists." They have enough power to give a fierce blow to the enemies who dare to violate their peace, tranquility, happiness, and beautiful life.

　　保卫和平运动中最响亮的号角
    张铁弦
    最近一、二年来，在苏联的文学和艺术里，出现了许多保卫世界和平和发扬国际主义的作品。在文学作品中，我们首先注意到的是诗歌。苏维埃的诗歌，在它的发展道路上，有着光荣的战斗传统。伟大的诗人马雅可夫斯基曾经说：“诗歌就是我们的旗帜和炸弹。”马雅可夫斯基和高尔基一样，也曾访问过美国，在有名的诗集《我发现美国》里，他愤怒地指斥了那些压迫和剥削人民的大资本家们，尖锐地讽刺了美国的生活方式。
    诗人、小说家兼剧作家的西蒙诺夫，最近几年写了许多首充满着国际主义精神的诗篇，他的诗集“朋友和敌人”获得了一九四八年度斯大林一等文艺奖金。他在这十七首诗作里，对国际朋友流露着真挚的热爱，对阶级敌人则表示着无比的憎恨。
    以描写苏联共产主义青年团生活而著称的诗人别塞勉斯基，还像从前那样的热情、年轻。近年来，他也写了许多拥护世界和平，打击战争贩子的诗歌，编成“愤怒的诗行”诗集出版。
    其他许多苏联诗人，也写了不少保卫世界和平，揭露资本主义社会丑恶的作品。譬如苏尔柯夫（《予世界以和平》诗集）马尔夏克（讽刺短诗和长诗《警卫着和平》），奥珊宁（《各民族的儿女》诗集），巴让（《英国印象》诗集），土尔松·札德（《印度谣曲》诗集），格利巴乔夫和基托维奇（献给朝鲜人民的一些诗歌），以及查洛夫，米哈尔珂夫，普尔柯菲耶夫，陀尔马托夫斯基等人的作品。
    在报告文学方面，首先应该指出的是苏联文艺工作者关于新中国和人民朝鲜的报道，譬如西蒙诺夫的《战斗着的中国》，苏联画家费诺格诺夫的《在新中国》，记者齐契特金娜的《解放了的中国》等。关于民主朝鲜的建设和美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的报道有毕尔文采夫的《在朝鲜》和最近出版的包尔金珂的《火中的朝鲜》（《星火》文艺小丛书）等。
    苏联的作家们为了保卫和平，拥护真理还经常地撰写一些犀利的政论文字。其中最出色的就是爱伦堡。他的政论集去年出版了两本《争取和平》与《和平的希望》。其他作家，如法捷耶夫、吉洪诺夫、萧洛霍夫、费定、巴甫连珂、波列伏依等人也都时常为苏联报刊撰写政论。
    至于戏剧作品和演剧活动，最近几年苏联的剧作家们，经常地注意到拥护人民民主和保卫世界和平的主题。这方面的创作，对我们中国读者最熟悉的，是《俄罗斯问题》（西蒙诺夫），《美国的声音》（拉甫连涅夫），《在某一个国家内》（微尔塔），《我要回家》（米哈尔珂夫）等。这些剧本最近不断地在莫斯科和其他城市上演。
    去年十一月底，莫斯科的《普希金纪念剧院》首次演出了克洛特珂夫的新作《约翰——和平战士》，这是描写美国著名的黑人歌唱家保罗·罗伯逊的战斗生活的一个剧本。这个剧由万宁任导演，俄罗斯共和国功勋演员拿兹万诺夫饰约翰（罗伯逊），在本届戏剧季（一九五○年——一九五一年）的上演次数中造成了很高的纪录。拿兹万诺夫在创造这个角色上，不但在动作和歌唱上获得了成功，更重要的是，他能够真实地表现出一个和平战士的坚强、勇敢、沉着和热情的性格。这个戏是以高呼“斯大林——和平”，“斯大林——和平”而收尾的，每场终结时，都引起观众们经久不息的欢呼和鼓掌。
    这方面的其他剧本还有：包哥廷的《密苏里的华尔兹曲》，穆吉万尼的《善良意志的人们》，描写捷克革命斗士伏契克的生活的《布拉格终属于我》（布里雅珂夫斯基），描写民主德国的《生活重新开始》（索布科），以和平签名运动为主题的小歌剧《自由的风》（杜纳耶夫斯基作曲）等。这些戏曲最近也经常在莫斯科的剧院里演出。
    近年来，以擅长短篇小说而闻名的作家安东诺夫，不久以前写了一个电影剧本，名为《和平使者》，这个剧本的中心人物是一个集体农庄的农妇，劳动英雄尼坎诺罗娃，她曾经到国外去参加国际妇女会议，她的儿子在爱国战争期间，为了拯救欧洲的弟兄而牺牲在那里。列宁格勒制片厂最近正在拍摄这部影片。
    苏联的音乐家们也在不断地为保卫世界和平运动而努力。首先应该提到的，就是几个有名的大合唱，譬如普罗珂菲耶夫的《警卫着和平》，曼涅维奇的《保卫和平》和科尔马略夫的《自由的中国》等。
    以争取和平为主题的群众歌曲，我们可以举出许多许多，这些歌曲不但在苏联人民中间非常流行，并且广泛地流传到世界各国去。譬如萧斯达珂维奇的《和平之歌》（陀尔马托夫斯基词），莫拉特里的《和平战士歌》（哈利东诺夫词）和《莫斯科——北京》（维尔什宁词），诺威珂夫的《和平之歌》（奥珊宁词）和《民主青年曲》（奥珊宁词），杜里珂夫的《我们拥护和平》（查洛夫词）与《和平的大军》（鲁布略夫词），别雷依的《保卫和平》（富林凯尔词）等。
    苏联的文学和艺术是世界上最先进的文学和艺术，我们从上面概略的一些报道中，可以看到，当目前美英帝国主义的生番们对朝鲜人民正在进行着疯狂的屠杀，战争贩子杜鲁门、马歇尔、杜勒斯等等之流正在鼓动着新的战争的时候，当战争正威胁着全世界的人类和儿童的时候，苏联的文艺工作者们是怎样地为拥护真理，保卫和坚持世界和平而奋斗。但是我们知道，苏联人民并非一般的“和平主义者”，他们有足够的力量对敢于侵犯他们的和平、安静、幸福、美好的生活的敌人，以猛烈的打击。
