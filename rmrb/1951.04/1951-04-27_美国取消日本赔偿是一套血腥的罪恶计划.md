　　U.S. Cancellation of Japanese Reparations is a Bloody Sinister Plan
　　Gao Ji
    The illegality, barbarity, and insidious viciousness of the "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan" unilaterally formulated by the United States are unprecedented. Wielding this "treaty," the United States not only completely obliterates the rights of the people of all countries that fought against Japan, monopolizes Japan, and revives Japan's aggressive forces, but also expresses its "leniency" towards Japan with its vicious plan to dominate and destroy Japan. The various provisions of Chapter VI, "Claims and Property," of the "Draft Treaty," are an example of this.
    In this chapter, the United States acts unilaterally, completely disregarding the will of the people of other countries that fought against Japan, and arbitrarily cancels the war reparations that Japan should pay. On the surface, this seems to be very "lenient" towards Japan. In fact, the United States deliberately excludes the legitimate demands of other countries and turns Japan into its legal colony under the guise of a "treaty" so that it can arbitrarily exploit and plunder. At the same time, canceling reparations is also to preserve and monopolize Japan's war industry and revive it as an arsenal for the United States to carry out expanded aggression in Asia. This is not only a vicious plan for Wall Street to endlessly extract the blood and sweat of the Japanese people, but also to push Japan back into the abyss of war. For the Japanese people and the Japanese economy, this is an absolutely perilous dead end.
    Looking at Chapter VI of the U.S. draft, it first closes the door to war reparations claims by stating that "Japan is unable" to "provide adequate compensation to the Allied Powers for losses caused by the war." However, simply rejecting the legitimate demands of countries that fought against Japan on the issue of reparations seemed too unreasonable even for the United States, so it had to make a big fuss in its "draft," saying that "the Allied Powers' claims for reparations" can only be "compensated by Japanese assets (referring to Japanese assets in the territories of various Allied countries)" and "assets obtained from the Japanese mainland during the occupation period." This passage seems to imply that there is still compensation, but in reality, it completely cancels compensation. Take China as an example. Japan's assets in China were entirely obtained by Japanese monopoly capitalists and Japanese warlords through plundering and cruel exploitation of the Chinese people. To call the crystallization of the Chinese people's blood and sweat "Japanese assets" is already a huge joke. And to actually use it as Japan's war reparations to China, the degree of absurdity is simply intolerable. As for the so-called "assets obtained from the Japanese mainland during the occupation period," it refers to the "early dismantling plan" unilaterally implemented by MacArthur from April 4, 1947, to May 12, 1949. The scope of dismantling under this "plan" only covered 18 Japanese army and navy arsenals, which is only a tiny fraction of Japan's total military industry, and they were all worthless, second-rate goods. Among them, the Kuomintang reactionary government at the time only obtained more than 9,000 pieces of broken machinery. According to the meaning of the U.S. "draft," this is the entirety of Japan's compensation to China.
    Not giving a single cent in reparations, while the "material assets of Japan's diplomatic and consular agencies" in various countries in the past, and "the property of non-political, religious, charitable, cultural or educational organizations," must be handed over to the Japanese reactionaries. The Chinese people are well aware of the evil deeds of imperialism in using religious, charitable, cultural, and educational undertakings to carry out aggression. This provision in the U.S.-made "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan" is not only an unreasonable plunder of the property of the people of various countries, but also clearly intends to use these properties to carry out its aggressive activities in various countries. The degree of barbarity and shamelessness is truly infuriating.
    During the war against Japan, the people of China and Asian countries suffered severe sacrifices and destruction of their lives and property. According to incomplete statistics, Chinese casualties exceeded ten million, and losses of public and private property amounted to more than 50 billion U.S. dollars. The United States, in its unilaterally formulated "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan," stubbornly ignores the right of the people of all countries to demand reasonable compensation, which is the product of such immense pain and sacrifice. Where is the sovereignty of the people of various countries in the eyes of the United States? Its arrogant behavior of lording over everything vividly demonstrates its hostility towards the people of the world.
    The U.S.'s absurd attitude on the issue of reparations, like on all other issues, completely violates all international agreements on the post-war Japanese issue. The Potsdam Proclamation, Article 11, clearly stipulated that Japan must "make fair compensation in kind to the Allied Powers." Chapter IV, Article 4, of the "Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan," passed by the Far Eastern Commission in June 1947, also had the following provisions on the principle of reparations: "In view of Japan's crimes of aggression, in order to provide fair compensation for the losses suffered by the Allied Powers due to Japan, and in order to eliminate the war potential in some of Japan's industries, Japan must be ordered to transfer any existing or future machinery, equipment, or goods produced by Japan, as determined by the Far Eastern Commission or the Far Eastern Commission's organizational regulations, which must be provided as reparations." Therefore, the U.S. "draft's" unilateral cancellation of reparations is illegal and invalid. The Chinese people will never recognize any unilateral action on the issue of Japan without the consent of the Chinese people.
    The U.S.'s violation of international agreements and its illegal attempt to cancel Japanese reparations is not to bestow favors on the Japanese people, but to monopolize the fruits of victory and preserve and restore Japan's war industry. This is an important step in the U.S. rearming Japan and driving the Japanese people to serve as its cannon fodder for aggression. Japan's war industry is one of the sources of Japan's aggression and a major threat to the peaceful life of the Asian people and the Japanese people. The history of Japan before and after World War II is a good illustration of this. Before World War II, especially before 1931 when Japanese fascist warlords launched the war of aggression against Northeast China, Japan was basically a country dominated by light industry. In 1931, the production of Japan's textile industry accounted for 40% of the total industrial production, but by 1939 it only accounted for 20%. With the development of Japan's aggressive forces, by 1942, the chemical industry alone in the war industry accounted for 20% of the total industrial output. And between 1943 and 1945, the expansion of Japan's war industry reached its peak, accounting for almost four-fifths of the total industrial output. This situation makes it easy to understand that Japan's war industry was fed and grew up in the blood and death of the Asian people and the Japanese people. And the Japanese monopoly financial groups made a fortune in this bloody business, and by the end of the war, they had become the masters of the entire Japanese economy. Regardless of the severe disasters suffered by the people of Asian countries during the war, the vast majority of Japanese people also suffered from the loss of their homes and the death of their families in the war, and their lives were plunged into extreme misery due to the heavy war burden. And now, the U.S. is expanding the war by preserving and restoring Japan's war industry, slaughtering the Asian people, and making the Japanese people bleed for the interests of U.S. monopoly capital. Doesn't this illustrate that the U.S.'s approach will harm both the Asian people and the Japanese people?
    Therefore, the main spirit of the provisions on the issue of Japanese reparations in the various agreements of the Allied countries on the issue of Japan after the war was to disarm Japan, dismantle Japan's war industry, and thereby dissolve the power of the Japanese financial groups, in order to achieve the goal of preventing war. At the same time, it also took into account Japan's peaceful economy and enabled the Japanese people to engage in peaceful trade with the people of various countries. However, the United States has consistently violated this policy, delaying and undermining the implementation of the reparations policy, and deliberately turning Japan's war industry into its arsenal. The so-called Pauley Plan announced in December 1945, the interim reparations plan proposed to the Far Eastern Commission in 1946, the Strack Plan announced in March 1948, and the Treibers Plan announced in May of the same year were all to achieve this goal, and they became more and more intensified step by step. By the time the United States formally declared to the Far Eastern Commission on May 12, 1949, that it would stop the so-called "early dismantling plan" and retain all of Japan's industrial equipment, even the main war industries, the United States' evil face was completely exposed. Thus, all of Japan's war industries were retained by the United States without any movement.
    Among these retained Japanese war industries, 645 had already resumed production by the end of 1949, manufacturing military supplies and various types of weapons and ammunition. Among them, 175 aircraft factories had started work, and the large-scale munitions manufacturing industries, such as the famous wartime "Sagamihara Army Arsenal" and "Akabane Ordnance Factory," are repairing and manufacturing tanks and various guns for the U.S. troops invading Korea. According to the figures released by the Economic Stabilization Board of the Japanese Yoshida government, the total value of war materials ordered by the United States in Japan since the start of the war of aggression against Korea to March 11 this year has reached 240,431,000 U.S. dollars. And the United States has formulated a plan stipulating that a large number of tanks, armored vehicles, transport ships, artillery, machine guns, rifles, and ammunition will be produced in Japan this year. Under these circumstances, the crisis of the people of Asian countries and the Japanese people being re-immersed in the pool of blood of war profits of the U.S. and Japanese monopoly financial groups is growing, and death is beginning to be manufactured on a large scale again.
    The U.S.'s sinister purpose of unilaterally canceling Japanese reparations, preserving and restoring Japan's war industry cannot be concealed. And through the U.S.-made "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan," Japan will be completely reduced to a U.S. colony, and therefore most of the war profits will fall into the pockets of U.S. financial groups, while Japanese monopoly capital can only get a few scraps, and the vast majority of Japanese people will have to bear heavy war burdens and serious war disasters. The U.S. "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan's" "leniency" on the issue of reparations is such a set of methods that will lead to the destruction of the Japanese people's country and families, killing people and drinking their blood.
    Therefore, the Chinese people, the Asian people, and the Japanese people must resolutely oppose the U.S. conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, so that this illegal, barbarous, and insidious "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan" of the United States will be buried in the flames of anger of the people of various countries.

　　美国取消日本赔偿是一套血腥的罪恶计划
　　高集
    美国单独制订的“对日和约草案”的非法、蛮横与阴险毒辣是史无前例的。手持这份“和约”的美国，不但完全磨灭了一切对日作战国家人民的权利，独霸日本，复活日本的侵略势力，而且还以它独霸和灭亡日本的毒辣计划，来表示它对日本的“宽大”。“草案”第六章“要求与财产”的各项规定，就是一例。
    在这一章中，美国一手遮天，完全不顾其他对日作战国家人民的意志，独断独行地勾消了日本应付的战争赔偿。看来，这像是对日本十分“宽大”的。其实，美国是蓄意排斥其他各国的合理要求，而在“和约”的形势下把日本变为它的合法殖民地，以便任意榨取剥削。同时，勾消赔偿，也是为了要保留并独占日本的战争工业，并使之复活，以作为美国在亚洲实行扩大侵略的兵工厂。这不但是一套为华尔街无止无休地汲取日本人民血汗的毒辣计划，而且是要把日本重新推入战争灾难的深渊。对于日本人民和日本经济，这是一条绝对险巇的死路。
    试看美国草案的第六章，首先它就以“日本无力”“对盟国因战争而引起之损失给以相当的赔偿”，来封闭住战争赔偿要求的大门。但一口拒绝对日作战国家在赔偿问题上的合理要求，似乎连美国也觉得太不像话，不得不在它的“草案”上大作其文章，说“盟国之赔偿要求”只能“由日本资产（按系指日本在各盟国领土上的资产）”及“占领期内自日本本土所已取得的资财赔偿之”。这段话的意思好像是还有赔偿，其实是完全取消赔偿。以中国为例。日本在中国的资产，完全是日本垄断资本家和日本军阀掠夺和以残酷手段剥削中国人民所取得的。把这种中国人民血汗的结晶，说成是日本的资产，已经是天大的笑话。而居然还要把它当作日本对中国的战争赔偿，其荒谬的程度简直是令人不能容忍的。至于所谓“占领期内自日本本土所已取得的资财”，指的就是一九四七年四月四日至一九四九年五月十二日麦克阿瑟所片面执行的“先期拆迁计划”。这一“计划”的拆迁范围，总共只有日本海陆军兵工厂十八所，不过是日本全部军需工业的九牛一毛而已，而且还都是不值钱的次等货。在其中，当时由国民党反动政府所取得的只是九千多件破烂机器。按照美国“草案”的意思，这就是日本对中国的全部赔偿了。
    赔偿一文不给，而日本过去在各国的“外交及领事机关的物质资财”，及“非政治性的、以及宗教、慈善、文化或教育等机关的财产”，还要交给日本反动派。帝国主义利用宗教、慈善、文化以及教育事业进行侵略活动的罪恶行为，是中国人民所熟知的。美制“对日和约草案”中的这一条规定，不但是要无理地掠夺各国人民的财产，而且显然是想利用这些财产在各国进行它的侵略活动。其蛮横无耻的程度真是令人怒不可遏。
    中国和亚洲各国人民，在对日作战期间，生命财产曾遭受到严重的牺牲与破坏。据不完全的统计，中国人命的伤亡在一千万以上，公私财产损失价值达五百亿美元以上。由这样巨大痛苦与牺牲的代价而产生的各国人民要求合理赔偿权利，美国竟一意孤行，在它单独制订的“对日和约草案”上予以抹杀。在美国眼中，各国人民的主权何在？其君临一切的狂妄行为，活现出它对全世界人民的敌视。
    美国在赔偿问题上的这种荒谬态度，正如在其他各种问题上一样，是完全违反了战后对日问题的一切国际协议。波茨坦公告第十一条曾明确规定，日本对各同盟国家必须“交付公正的实物赔偿”。一九四七年六月由远东委员会通过之“对投降后日本之基本政策”的第四章第四条对赔偿原则又有如下之规定：“由于日本所犯侵略罪行，为使日本加于各盟国之损失得到公平之赔偿起见，并为消除日本若干工业中之作战潜力起见，凡日本现存或将来生产之机器设备或货物，由远东委员会决策或远东委员会组织规程规定为必须提供赔偿者，必须勒令日本移交，充作赔偿。”因此，美国“草案”片面取消赔偿，是非法的，也是无效的。在对日问题上未经中国人民同意的任何片面行动，中国人民都绝不承认。
    美国违反国际协定，非法地力图取消日本赔偿，并不是要施惠于日本人民，而是要独吞胜利的果实，保存和恢复日本的战争工业。这是美国重新武装日本、驱使日本人民充当其侵略炮灰的重要步骤。日本的战争工业是日本侵略根源之一，也是亚洲人民和日本人民和平生活的重大威胁。第二次世界大战前后的日本历史，就是很好的说明。在第二次世界大战以前，尤其是一九三一年，日本法西斯军阀发动侵略我国东北的战争以前，日本基本上是一个轻工业占优势的国家。在一九三一年时，日本纺织工业的生产要占全部工业生产的百分之四十，到了一九三九年就只占百分之二十了。随着日本侵略势力的发展，至一九四二年时，仅战争工业中的化学工业一项，其产量就占了全部工业产量的百分之二十。而在一九四三至一九四五年间，日本战争工业的膨胀就达到了极点，几占全部工业生产的五分之四以上。这情形就使人不难了解，日本的战争工业是在亚洲人民及日本人民的血泊与死亡中喂养长大的。而日本的独占财阀就在这种血腥的生意中大发横财，到战争结束时他们已成为日本全部经济的主宰者了。且不论亚洲各国人民在战争中所遭受的严重灾害，就是广大的日本人民也在战争中家破人亡，且因沉重的战争负担使生活陷于极度悲惨。而如今，美国却又以保留和恢复日本的战争工业来扩大战争，屠杀亚洲人民，并使日本人民为美国独占资本的利益而流血。难道这还不能说明，美国的这种做法将使亚洲人民和日本人民都遭其害吗？
    所以，战后同盟国家对日本问题的各种协议中关于日本赔偿问题的规定，其主要的精神是在解除日本武装，拆迁日本战争工业，并借以解散日本财阀势力，而达到杜绝战争的目的。同时，还顾到日本的和平经济，并使日本人民与各国人民进行和平贸易。但是美国却一贯地违反这种政策，拖延与破坏赔偿政策之执行，蓄意要把日本战争工业变为它的兵工厂。所谓一九四五年十二月发表的鲍莱计划，一九四六年向远东委员会建议的临时赔偿方案，一九四八年三月发表之斯揣克计划，以及同年五月发表之特莱柏计划，都是为了要实现这个目的，而且一步比一步加紧。及至一九四九年五月十二日美国向远东委员会正式声明，停止所谓“先期拆迁计划”，保留日本一切工业设备，甚至主要的战争工业，这时美国的罪恶面目便完全暴露出来了。于是日本全部的战争工业便被美国丝毫未动地保留下来了。
    这些被保留下来的日本战争工业，仅在一九四九年年底就有六百四十五家恢复了生产，制造军需物资和各种型式的武器与弹药。其中开工的飞机工厂就有一百七十五家，至于战时著名的“相模原造兵厂”，“赤羽兵器厂”等大型的军火制造工业，则正在为侵朝美军修理和制造坦克和各种枪炮。据日本吉田政府的经济安定本部所公布的数字，自侵朝战争开始以来至今年三月十一日止，美国在日本订购的战争物资的总值，已达两亿四千零四十三万一千美元。而且美国已制订了计划，规定今年要在日本生产大量坦克、装甲车、运输舰、大炮、机关枪、步枪和弹药等。在这种情形下，亚洲各国人民和日本人民重新被浸入美国及日本独占财阀战争利润血泊中的危机在增长着，死亡又在开始大量制造。
    美国片面取消日本赔偿，保留并恢复日本战争工业的罪恶目的，是掩盖不住的。而且通过美制的“对日和约草案”，日本将完全沦为美国的殖民地，因而战争的利润也将大部分落入美国财阀的口袋中，日本的独占资本只能分得一点残羹，而广大的日本人民却要承受沉重的战争负担和严重的战争灾害。美国“对日和约草案”在赔偿问题上的“宽大”，就是这样一套使日本人民国破家亡，杀人又喝血的办法。
    所以，中国人民、亚洲人民和日本人民要坚决反对美国对日单独媾和的阴谋，以使美国这份非法、蛮横与阴险毒辣的“对日和约草案”，埋葬在各国人民愤怒的火焰中。
