　　Chongqing's suppression of counter-revolutionaries has developed into a mass movement. Tens of thousands of workers and nearby residents from the 21st, 29th, and five other factories have held anti-espionage rallies. The broad masses of citizens have actively assisted public security organs in arresting, pursuing, and denouncing a large number of counter-revolutionaries, including more than 40 key members of the "Chinese Civilian Revolutionary Party," a spy organization directly directed by the United States, such as Deng Jinheng (alias Deng Maoyuan), the Southwest Regional Commander.
　　The people of Chongqing have been actively denouncing the crimes of the spies. Eight spies from the 29th, 21st, 50th, 20th, and 10th factories, including Zou Di and Wang Lianfang, arrested progressive workers Yu Zusheng and Gou Yuebin and imprisoned them in the Zhazidong prison, where they were murdered. On the eve of liberation, these spies organized a "Destruction Brigade" and used explosives to destroy the power plant, iron smelting furnace, tool workshop, and powder magazine of the aforementioned five factories. The destroyed electricity accounted for about 50 percent of the total electricity in the Chongqing area. The lives and property of workers and nearby residents suffered heavy losses. In the 21st factory alone, there were more than 130 casualties. Near the powder magazine, 1,747 residents were killed or injured, with nearly 20 families wiped out, and about 5,000 households destroyed. At the anti-espionage rallies, which were attended by up to ten thousand people in each factory, many victims bitterly denounced the spies' bloody crimes. Ma Cundi, a female worker from the 21st factory, laboriously used a prosthetic leg and walked onto the stage with crutches, saying with tears in her eyes: "Six of my family of seven were blown to death, and I became disabled. It's all the fault of these bastards." Worker Ding Pingdong painfully recalled: "The families of Zhu Qifa, who worked with us, four people; Han Enyuan, five people; and the family of Liu Kaideng, Xia Liangzhang's mother, Chen Wenfu, and Peng Liangqing's wife's heads and legs were blown to pieces. It was me and other comrades who found them piece by piece from under the collapsed houses, from the blood." Yu Zude, the brother of Yu Zusheng, an underground party member of the 21st factory who was murdered, was so agitated when he took the stage that he could only say: "Revenge, revenge!" When the Chongqing Municipal People's Court accepted the people's request and executed these eight heinous bandits on the spot, the masses present cheered. At the same time, the Chongqing public security organs also executed Xie Yuqiao, the spy who was the murderer in the "Jiaochangkou" and "Cangbaitang" incidents, and Ni Zhicao, a criminal in the "Southern Anhui Incident." These measures greatly strengthened the determination of the broad masses of the people in Chongqing to suppress counter-revolutionaries. They actively reported and secretly informed the Chongqing public security authorities of counter-revolutionaries; many moving deeds emerged. For example, the woman Guo Huixia denounced her father, who was a spy, and the student Chen Songxi denounced his brother, who was a spy.
　　On March 13, the Chongqing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau arrested a large number of counter-revolutionaries at one time based on prior detailed investigations (including information provided by residents). The broad masses actively helped the Public Security Bureau to pursue, give directions, and search for documents, which made the arrest work go smoothly. A spy in the Jiaochangkou Peace Market tried to escape, but nearby residents immediately cooperated in the pursuit and finally arrested him. Miao Jiu'an, the son of Miao Zishu of Minguo Road, was a Central Statistics Bureau (CC) spy. He escaped during the arrest. Miao Zishu personally reported to the public security organs and had the spy arrested.
　　The citizens were jubilant and encouraged after this group of spies was arrested. When the delegates attending the first Chongqing Municipal Women's Congress saw batches of arrested spies passing by the gate, they all shouted: "Arrest one more spy, reduce one enemy!" The residents of Dajing Lane immediately wrote the crimes of the arrested spies in the area on the blackboard newspaper. Residents in the various police stations of the Public Security Bureau held mass meetings to denounce the crimes of the spies. At a mass meeting of more than 1,000 people held by the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, Xu Peiyun, the representative of Dongsheng Building, said: "This time, the people's government's arrest of spies is a concrete manifestation of protecting the people. We must unite and continue to report spy elements."

　　重庆镇压反革命形成群众运动
　  数万工人居民举行反特务大会人民协助政府追捕特务
    【本报讯】重庆市镇压反革命工作形成群众性运动。第二十一、二十九等五个工厂数万工人及附近居民纷纷举行反特务大会。广大市民积极协助治安机关逮捕、追缉、检举了大批反革命分子，其中包括美国直接指使下的特务组织“中国平民革命党”西南区总指挥邓锦寰（化名邓懋元）等首要分子四十余名。
    重庆市人民纷纷控诉特务的罪恶。第二十九、二十一、五十、二十、十等五个工厂的特务分子邹涤、王莲芳等八人逮捕过进步工人余祖胜、苟悦彬等，并将他们投入渣滓洞监禁，杀害。解放前夕，这些特务分子又组织“破坏大队”，用火药炸毁了上述五厂的电力厂、炼铁炉、工具所、火药库等。被毁的电动力即占全重庆区电力百分之五十左右。工人和附近居民的生命财产受到了惨重损失。第二十一厂职工的死伤，即达一百三十余人。火药库附近居民死伤一千七百四十七人，其中全家遭难者近二十家，被毁户共达五千户左右。在各厂数达万人以上的反特务大会上，许多被难者悲愤控诉特务分子的血腥罪行。二十一厂女工马存弟艰苦地用一支假腿，扶着拐杖走上台去，一句一泪地说：“我一家七口人，炸死了六个，自己还成了残废，都是这些狗仔害的。”工人丁平东痛苦地回忆说：“和我们一起作工的朱启发一家子四口、韩恩远一家子五口及刘开登一家子、夏良章的妈、陈文福、彭良清的女人被炸烂了的头、腿，都是我和别的同志，从垮了的房子底下，从血中一点一点找出来的。”被害了的二十一厂工人地下党同志余祖胜的哥哥余祖德，上台以后，激愤得只能说：“报仇，报仇！”重庆市人民法院接受人民要求，将这八个罪大恶极的匪徒就地执行枪决时，与会群众纷纷称快。同时，重庆市治安机关又枪毙了“较场口”、“沧白堂”事件凶手特务谢雨樵、“皖南事变”罪犯倪志操等。这些措施，大大增强了重庆广大人民镇压反革命分子的决心。他们纷纷主动地向重庆市治安当局检举与密告反革命分子；其间出现了很多动人的事迹。如妇女郭辉霞检举了她的特务父亲，学生陈松熙检举了他的特务哥哥。
    三月十三日，重庆市人民政府公安局根据事先细密的调查（包括居民供给的情报），一次逮捕了大批反革命分子。广大群众又积极帮助公安局追缉、指路、搜查证件，使逮捕工作顺利进行。较场口和平市场内有一个特务企图逃跑，附近居民立即协同追缉，终于逮捕归案。民国路苗子书的儿子苗久安是个中统特务他在逮捕时漏网。苗子书亲自向治安机关检举，把这个特务逮捕起来。
    这批特务被逮捕后，市民欢腾鼓舞。正在参加重庆市首届妇女代表大会的代表看到一批批被逮捕的特务从门前经过时，全体高呼：“多捉一个特务，减少一个敌人！”大井巷居民立刻将该区被捕特务的罪恶写在黑板报上。公安局各派出所内的居民都分别召开群众大会，控诉特务罪行。在公安局一分局召开的一千多人的群众大会上，东升楼代表徐佩云说：“这次人民政府逮捕特务是保护人民的具体表现。我们要团结起来继续检举特务分子。”
