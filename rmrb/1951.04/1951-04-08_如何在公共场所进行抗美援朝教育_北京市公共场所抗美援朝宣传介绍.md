How to Conduct Resist America, Aid Korea Education in Public Places
—An Introduction to Anti-American Aid Korea Propaganda in Public Places in Beijing
　　Jin Feng
    In public places where thousands upon thousands of people gather daily, it is important to carry out Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education, as it is a vital method for popularizing the patriotic movement.

    In all public places, such as scenic spots and historical sites, parks, libraries, museums, train stations, cinemas, theaters, cultural palaces, vegetable markets, factories, schools, stores, teahouses, and restaurants, propaganda can be carried out extensively, universally, and regularly through exhibitions, or by posting vivid and powerful slogans, photographs, pictures, cartoons, comic strips, propaganda models, maps of Korea, etc. The "Resist America, Aid Korea Exhibition" at the Beijing Palace Museum has been visited by over 250,000 people. The "Resist America, Aid Korea Art Exhibition" at the Labor People's Cultural Palace has been visited by over 80,000 people. The photo exhibitions in the thirteen cultural centers in Beijing have been visited by over 1.1 million people.

    It must be noted that the content of various propaganda materials in public places must be constantly updated in line with the development of the situation in order to continuously improve people's political awareness. A major shortcoming in the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda in many public places in Beijing is the failure to do so. The Resist America, Aid Korea slogans posted in vegetable markets, teahouses, and restaurants are outdated and falling off; the photos of American atrocities in Zhongshan Park and the Cultural Palace have been exposed to the sun for three months and are beginning to blur and fade. The propaganda at the Beijing East Railway Station is better, where fine arts workers responsible for decorating the station have created large, exquisite cartoons, which are displayed in the waiting room and are updated from time to time. Where conditions permit, public places can also use broadcasting. The Beijing East Railway Station combines business broadcasts with current affairs news, which is very popular with passengers.

    In addition to libraries, museums, shops, and restaurants, other public places can from time to time hold mass rallies on Resist America, Aid Korea with broad public engagement, including cultural and entertainment performances, costumed propaganda, festival entertainment, film screenings, evening parties, current affairs reports, garden parties, and so on. Among these, the impact of garden parties is the greatest. During the "March 8th" festival, 200,000 women visited Beijing's parks, and many elderly women who rarely left their homes learned about Resist America, Aid Korea for the first time from the cultural and entertainment programs at the garden parties.

    When holding various forms of mass gatherings, public places need to plan and organize various forces to participate jointly. Zhongshan Park and Beihai Park have organized students from nearby schools and have also hired ballad singers to perform and promote in the parks, which has been very effective. Agencies, organizations, factories, and schools with propaganda capabilities also need to strive to conduct propaganda in these crowded places. (Zhongshan Park had about 1.6 million visitors last year. This year, the number is even greater, with over 600,000 visitors in January and February alone.)

    Amusement venues and theaters mainly use artists to conduct regular propaganda in artistic forms. Here, it is necessary to address the political study of the artists. The Tianqiao ballad group, under the leadership of the local police station, conducts current affairs and political studies every Monday and Friday. Their current affairs propaganda has a great effect. Those who perform wrestling and magic start talking about current events after the preliminary introductions; those who sing drum songs and ballad operas compose new lyrics when singing in teahouses and theaters. When Beijing took resolute measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries, they immediately composed and sang new lyrics about "The Execution of Liu Fenglin" (the Tianqiao bully who was executed).

    Cultural centers and newspaper reading rooms can do a lot of work in popularizing propaganda. The Beijing Fourth Cultural Center's cultivation of activists from the masses to promote current affairs has proven to be a good way to popularize the Resist America, Aid Korea movement among the unorganized masses. These current affairs propaganda activists from the masses are cultivated from activists in daily mass work. They participate in the cultural center's propaganda meetings and organize themselves to study current affairs and policies. When conducting Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda, the center convenes weekly reporting meetings to listen to and summarize their work and experiences, and to provide concrete assistance in analyzing, studying, and resolving mass ideological problems at any time. Their propaganda methods are very flexible, often convening small lecture meetings or forums of ten or eight people, lasting no more than an hour, and addressing only one main issue at a time. They also visit their neighbors or relatives and friends to conduct propaganda, which makes it easiest to solve individual problems. More effective is their propaganda at any time, any place, and any occasion. Some current affairs propaganda activists conduct propaganda while chatting with others.

    Currently, public places in Beijing are formulating propaganda plans for April and for the year. Train stations are preparing to organize small performances in waiting rooms, parks are preparing to hold regular exhibitions, some shops are preparing to decorate propaganda windows, and cultural centers are preparing to coordinate propaganda within their districts. What needs to be noted afterwards is to ensure the implementation of the plan and the regularity of the propaganda work, to overcome the past phenomenon of being hot and cold, and to keep the face of Beijing's public places fresh and saturated with the atmosphere of the Resist America, Aid Korea battle.

　　如何在公共场所进行抗美援朝教育
　  ——北京市公共场所抗美援朝宣传介绍
　　金凤
    在每日有成千、成万群众聚集着的公共场所，应好好进行抗美援朝的宣传教育，这是普及爱国运动的重要方法。
    在所有公共场所，如名胜古迹、公园、图书馆、博物馆、车站、影院、剧场、文化宫、菜市、工厂、学校、商店、茶馆、酒馆等，可以大量地、普遍地而又经常地进行的宣传方式是举行展览会，或者分别张贴生动有力的标语、照片、图片、漫画、连环画、宣传模型、朝鲜地图等。北京故宫历史博物馆的“抗美援朝展览”，参观者已超过二十五万人。劳动人民文化宫的“抗美援朝美术作品展览”，参观者也超过八万人。北京市十三个文化馆的照片展览，参观人数在一百一十万人以上。
    这里须要注意的是：各公共场所各种宣传品，必须随着形势的发展而不断地更换内容，以便不断提高人民的政治认识。北京市许多公共场所的抗美援朝宣传的一个大缺点，就是没有这样做。在菜市、茶馆、酒楼张贴的抗美援朝标语陈旧了，脱落了；中山公园、文化宫的美军暴行照片被三个月来的日光晒得开始模糊、褪色。北京东车站的宣传较好，在那里，负责装饰站容的美术工作者绘制了大幅精美的漫画，张挂在候车室，并不时更换内容。在有条件的地方，各公共场所还可以采用广播方式。北京东车站结合业务广播而广播时事新闻，很受旅客欢迎。
    除了图书馆、博物馆、商店、酒楼以外，其他的公共场所一概可以不时地进行接触群众面很大的抗美援朝群众集会，包括文化娱乐节目的演出、化装宣传、节日娱乐、放映电影、晚会、时事报告，游园等等。其中以游园的影响为最大。“三八”节北京游园的妇女达二十万人，许多足不出门的老太太，从游园时的文化娱乐节目中第一次地知道了抗美援朝。
    在举办各种形式的群众性的集会时，公共场所都需要有计划地组织各方面的力量来共同进行。中山公园、北海公园都曾组织附近学校的学生，并曾聘请曲艺演员到公园表演、宣传，收效很大。有宣传力量的机关、团体、工厂、学校，也需要争取到这些群众众多的地方进行宣传。（中山公园去年一年游客约有一百六十多万。今年人数更多，仅在一、二两月，游客已达六十多万。）
    游艺场所及剧场，主要是通过艺人以艺术形式来作经常的宣传。这里需要解决艺人的政治学习问题。天桥曲艺小组在当地派出所领导下，每星期一、五进行时事政治学习。通过他们来进行时事宣传，效果很大。那些摔跤，耍魔术的，在地场上圆场以后就讲开了时事；那些说大鼓、唱坠子的就在茶馆、戏院清唱时编唱了新词。当北京市采取坚决镇压反革命措施时，他们又立即编唱了《枪毙刘凤林》（被处决的天桥恶霸）的新词。
    文化馆和书报阅览室可以在普及宣传这一点上做很多的工作。北京市第四文化馆从群众中培养时事宣传的积极分子，证明是把抗美援朝运动普及到无组织群众中去的良好方式。这些群众中的时事宣传积极分子，是由平时群众工作中的积极分子培养而成的。他们参加文化馆的宣传会议，并组织在一起学习时事、政策。在进行抗美援朝宣传时，由馆方每周召集汇报会议，听取和总结他们的工作情况和经验，随时具体帮助他们分析、研究和解决群众思想问题。他们宣传的方法非常灵活，经常召集十人、八人的小型演讲会或座谈会，时间不超过一点钟，一次只解决一个主要问题。他们也到左邻右舍或亲戚朋友家串门宣传，这样最容易解决个别问题。更有效的是他们随时、随地、随事进行宣传。有些时事宣传的积极分子，在和别人聊天时即进行了宣传。
    现在北京市公共场所正在拟订四月间及一年内的宣传计划。车站准备在候车室内组织小型演出，各公园都准备举办经常性的展览，有些商店准备布置宣传橱窗，各文化馆准备配合区内进行宣传。此后需要注意的是保证计划的实施以及宣传工作的经常化，克服过去一冷一热的现象，而使北京公共场所面貌常新，饱和着抗美援朝战斗的气息。
