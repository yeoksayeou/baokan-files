　　Lüda City People from All Walks of Life Hold Memorial Ceremony for Compatriots Killed by Japanese Bandits
　　Firmly Oppose the United States Arming Japan
    [Report from this newspaper] Xinhua News Agency reports: More than 5,000 people from all walks of life in Lüda City went to the White Jade Mountain in Lushun on the 5th of this month (Qingming Festival) to sweep the tombs at the Wan Zhong Cemetery to mourn the more than 20,000 compatriots who were massacred by Japanese bandits during the Sino-Japanese War 57 years ago. Today, as the Chinese people have achieved brilliant victories, the people of Lüda, reflecting on the past and looking at the present, have become increasingly resentful of the crime of the United States rearming Japan. The families of the victims successively accused the Japanese bandits of the atrocities of massacring the people of Lüda in front of the tomb. A demonstration was held after the meeting.
