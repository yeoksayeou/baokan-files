　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 11th: The "Yonghao" tanker, belonging to China, with a deadweight of 15,000 tons, which had been repaired in Hong Kong, was unreasonably ordered to be "requisitioned" by the Hong Kong British government on April 7th. The Yonghao tanker is under the direct jurisdiction of the China Tanker Company of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government. It had been docked in Hong Kong for repairs. It was originally scheduled to be completed and returned to China to serve the people in early March of this year. However, in February and March, the British-owned Huangpu Shipyard, which was repairing the tanker, colluded with the remnant bandits in Taiwan, and filed a lawsuit with the Hong Kong court, conspiring to create a so-called ownership issue for the Yonghao tanker, in an attempt to seize this giant vessel. On March 14th of this year, Zhang Bojun, Minister of Communications of the Central People's Government, issued a statement denouncing this shameless conspiracy, and pointed out that the Hong Kong British government should respect and be responsible for protecting the state property of the People's Republic of China in Hong Kong from infringement. On March 21st, the agent of the Yonghao tanker in Hong Kong, China Merchants Bureau, went to the Hong Kong Marine Department to clear customs, intending to tow the vessel back to China. However, the Marine Department deliberately made things difficult, using various documents as excuses to obstruct the vessel's customs clearance. Since the application for customs clearance began on March 21st, there have been more than ten negotiations. Until April 4th, all the documents required by the Hong Kong Marine Department had been prepared, and the Hong Kong Marine Department had no further excuses to use, but still unreasonably delayed and refused to allow the Yonghao tanker to clear customs for export. At 9:00 AM on April 7th, the Chief Secretary of the Hong Kong British government suddenly unreasonably issued an order to "requisition" the Yonghao tanker, thus fully exposing the Hong Kong British government's deliberate conspiracy to seize the Yonghao tanker. Shao Liang, the representative of the China Tanker Company in Hong Kong, sternly rejected this unreasonable measure on the spot, and pointed out that the Yonghao tanker is the state property of the People's Republic of China, and the Hong Kong British government has no right to "requisition" it. However, the Hong Kong British government brutally dispatched Hong Kong Marine Police Station's No. 13 steamer and 16 armed marine police officers to board the ship at 1:00 PM on April 8th to conduct armed surveillance of the Yonghao tanker. All the employees of the tanker were extremely resentful and resolutely opposed this despicable and shameless piratical act of the Hong Kong British government. The Hong Kong British government's deliberate act of seizing the state property of the People's Republic of China has aroused extreme anger and resolute opposition from the people of the whole country.

　　香港英政府劫夺我“永灏”油轮
  　我国人民对此表示极度愤怒和反对
  　该轮员工反对香港英政府海盗行径
    【新华社广州十一日电】留在香港业已修竣的我国油轮永灏号，载重一万五千吨，已被香港英国政府于四月七日无理下令“征用”。永灏油轮属于中央人民政府交通部中国油轮公司直接管辖，一直停泊在香港修理，今年三月上旬，本可修竣并驶返中国为人民服务，但于二、三月间，修理该轮的英商黄埔船厂乘该轮行将修竣之际，竟勾结台湾残匪，向香港法院提出诉讼，阴谋制造所谓永灏油轮之产权问题，妄图劫夺此一巨轮。本年三月十四日中央人民政府交通部章伯钧部长已发表声明，斥责此一无耻阴谋，并指出香港英国政府应该尊重并负责保护中华人民共和国留港的国家财产不受侵犯。三月二十一日永灏轮在香港代理人招商局往香港海事处结关，拟将该轮拖回本国。但海事处故意百般刁难，借口需要各种证件，阻挠该船结关。计自三月二十一日开始申请结关起，交涉不下十余次之多。直至四月四日，凡香港海事处所需要的一切证件均经备齐，香港海事处已无任何借口可乘，但仍无理拖延，不准永灏轮结关出口。四月七日上午九时香港英国政府辅政司突然无理地下令“征用”永灏油轮，至此香港英国政府蓄意劫夺永灏油轮之阴谋遂全部暴露。中国油轮公司驻香港代表邵良对于英方此种无理措施，当场加以严正拒绝，并指出永灏油轮乃系中华人民共和国国家财产，香港英国政府无权“征用”，但香港英国政府竟于四月八日下午一时横蛮地派遣香港水师警署十三号汽船一艘及武装水警十六名登船武装监视永灏油轮。该轮全体员工对于香港英国政府这种卑劣无耻的海盗行径莫不痛恨万分，坚决反对。香港英国政府此次蓄意劫夺中华人民共和国国家财产的行为，业已引起全国人民极度的愤怒和坚决的反对。
