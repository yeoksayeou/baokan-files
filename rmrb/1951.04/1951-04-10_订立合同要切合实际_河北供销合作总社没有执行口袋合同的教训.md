　　Concluding Contracts Should Be Realistic
　　Lessons Learned from the Hebei Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Failure to Execute a "Pocket Contract"

Editor:

　　Last October, the Northeast Department Store commissioned the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative to weave 257,000 bags. The contract explicitly stipulated that the goods should be delivered within 25 days, but the delivery was delayed by more than a month. The reasons for the delayed delivery are as follows:

　　First, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative did not consider the matter thoroughly when concluding the contract. For such a large order, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative had to allocate the task to the cooperatives in various special districts, counties, and villages to organize members to produce. This arrangement work alone would take half a month. Therefore, the original stipulation of delivering the goods within 25 days was unrealistic.

　　Second, in the distribution of production tasks, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative did not make reasonable allocations based on the weaving skills and production capacity of the masses in various regions, committing a bias towards egalitarianism. Taking Tong County Special District as an example, because the masses in this area lacked weaving skills, the bags they produced were of very poor quality and could not be delivered, wasting a large amount of manpower and financial resources.

　　Third, during the production process, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative failed to promptly correct the phenomenon of products not meeting specifications, resulting in low quality of the finished products. Although the Northeast Department Store made concessions on this, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative suffered a loss in its credit for fulfilling the contract.

　　订立合同要切合实际
　  河北供销合作总社没有执行口袋合同的教训编辑同志：
    去年十月间东北百货公司委托河北省供销合作总社代织口袋二十五万七千条。合同上明文规定应在二十五天内交货，但结果却推延了一个多月才交货。延迟交货的原因有下面几点：
    第一，订合同时河北省供销合作总社考虑不够周密。这样大的一批订货，省供销合作总社必需拨交各专区、县、村合作社去组织社员生产。仅这一项布置工作就需费半个月的时间。所以原规定在二十五天内交货，是不切合实际的。
    第二，河北省供销合作总社在分配生产任务中，没有根据各地群众的织口袋技术和生产能力予以合理分配，犯了平均主义的偏向。以通县专区为例，该区群众因为没有织口袋技术，结果织出来的口袋质量太差，没有能交出去，浪费了大批的人力与财力。
    第三，在生产过程中，河北省供销合作总社未能及时纠正产品不合规格的现象，致使成品质量不高。东北百货公司对此虽作了让步，但河北省供销合作总社，在执行合同的信用上却受到了损失。
