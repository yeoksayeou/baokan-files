The International Association of Democratic Lawyers Struggles for Peace
    Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court

    The International Association of Democratic Lawyers was founded in 1946. It is an international organization of legal workers and professional scientific legal experts from various countries. The current Chairman of the Council is Pritt (UK), the Vice Chairman is Drachina (Italy), the Secretary-General is Nordmann (France), and the Deputy Secretary-General is Mosca (Poland).

    The organizational purpose of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers is stated in the association's charter as follows:

    "(1) To facilitate close contact and exchange of views among legal workers and professional scientific experts' organizations in various countries, and to develop their mutual understanding and spirit of friendship;

    (2) To study and compare the laws of various countries, to work for the advancement of legal science, to study the formation of universal international law among democratic countries, and to promote the development of international law;

    (3) To cooperate in achieving the purposes of the United Nations, and to demand joint action by legal workers in order to:

    (1) Restore, defend and develop the democratic rights and freedoms indicated by the United Nations, both legally and practically;

    (2) Promote the domestic and international implementation of plans to punish war criminals, and eradicate the remnants of fascism and other anti-democratic ideas in domestic and international law;

    (3) Unite the strength of legal workers with the strength of all other groups to defend democratic principles in every country, respect the law in international relations, and establish a strong and lasting peace;

    (4) Promote the independence of all nations throughout the world, and oppose any legal restriction, whether domestic or international, and in practice, on such independence."

    Since 1946, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers has been tirelessly fighting for its organizational goals. The association has put forward the solemn and resounding slogan: "Maintain peace with law!" calling on its members—legal scholars' organizations from various countries—to unite all legal workers to serve world peace and people's democracy. In every struggle to uphold the legal status of the United Nations Charter, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Declaration, and to protect world peace and the democratic rights of the people, the association has exposed and protested the frantic war plans of the world's aggressive bloc headed by U.S. imperialism, the trampling on the basic rights of the people, the interference with and oppression of the colonial nations' independence movements, and supported the movements of the people of these countries to strive for peace, democracy, and national independence, and conducted just defenses for the persecution of peace and democracy fighters and political refugees in these countries. The International Association of Democratic Lawyers and its members have written to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, protesting the U.S.'s armed intervention in Korea; written to the Nuremberg Military Tribunal, accusing U.S. imperialism and its accomplices of their criminal war activities, and requesting the judges of the Nuremberg Military Tribunal to agree to the Budapest Declaration against the use of atomic weapons; protested the occupation authorities in West Germany and Japan, disregarding the anger of hundreds of millions of people around the world, disregarding the dignity of the United Nations Charter, and for the purpose of another war of aggression, rearming West Germany, arming Japan, and releasing large numbers of German and Japanese war criminals; protested the notorious McCarran Act, which tramples on basic human rights and leads the United States towards fascism; and protested the atrocities of the Greek monarcho-fascist government, which imprisoned and massacred hundreds and thousands of patriotic soldiers under trumped-up charges, who had fought bloody battles for the independence and freedom of Greece against Nazi Germany and Anglo-American interventionists since 1940.

    The work of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers shows that it is a true peace fighter. Its just action of "maintaining peace with law" is closely linked to the fate of mankind and the conscience of man. It defends world peace and the democratic rights of the people with the united strength of international democratic legal workers, which is to defend mankind from another devastating war disaster, and to defend the basic rights of the laboring people—the true progressive force of mankind that creates social material civilization. Therefore, the association's work is supported and respected by hundreds of millions of people around the world, and the public enemies of peaceful humanity, the aggressive bloc headed by U.S. imperialism and its accomplices in various countries, hate the association even more, and persecute it by various despicable means. The United Nations, usurped by U.S. imperialism, slandered the association's efforts to maintain the law and maintain peace as "abuse of consultative rights" and shamefully revoked the association's right as a consultative body of the UN Economic and Social Council; subsequently, the French government prohibited the association from establishing its headquarters in Paris. The United Nations and the French government unreasonably rejected the association and its national member organizations, as well as the International Union of Students and others, protesting the illegal resolutions and bans on the association, once again proving that the attacks and persecution of the association by the imperialist bloc and its accomplices are actually attacks and persecutions on the United Nations Charter, attacks and persecutions on human peace and democratic rights.

    However, the will and determination of the people of all nations of the world to uphold the United Nations Charter and defend peace and democracy is indestructible. It is increasingly consolidated and united around the world peace fortress—the Soviet Union—becoming a huge fighting force! The struggle of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers to "maintain peace with law" is also continuing to develop under the banner of the World Peace Congress.

    On November 23 and 24, 1950, following the closing of the Second World Peace Congress, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers held a council meeting in Warsaw, the capital of Poland. Representatives from the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, Poland, India, Iran, and South American countries participated in the presidium of the council meeting. Professor Qian Duansheng, a representative of the Chinese New Law Research Association attending the Second World Peace Congress, participated in the council meeting on behalf of the Chinese New Law Research Association and was one of the members of the presidium.

    The Warsaw Council Meeting of the Association called on the member organizations of various countries to unite the broadest possible range of legal workers who support democracy and peace, and to strive to implement the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress and the Warsaw Council Meeting of the Association.

    The Chinese New Law Research Association joined the International Association of Democratic Lawyers in 1949, becoming an important member. The People's Republic of China, headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, is a great country with a population of nearly 500 million, and it has an exceptionally important influence in international affairs. Therefore, Secretary-General Nordmann and Mosca of the Association repeatedly expressed at the Warsaw meeting the desire for our association to strengthen ties with the association, strengthen cultural exchanges, and requested our association to do more work in the cause of peace and democracy, especially among Asian democratic legal workers. When communicating and discussing the resolutions of the Warsaw meeting of the Association, the Chinese New Law Research Association deeply recognized that the current struggle of the entire Chinese people, with strong determination and majestic posture, to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, land reform, and suppress counter-revolutionaries, is an important aspect of the struggle of the people of the world for peace and democracy.

    In order to earnestly implement the resolutions of the Warsaw meeting of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, the Chinese New Law Research Association requires its members to unite all peace-loving and patriotic legal workers, and together with the people of the whole country, actively participate in the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, to defend the victory of the Chinese people and defend world peace!

　　国际民主法学家协会为和平斗争
    最高人民法院院长  沈钧儒
    国际民主法学家协会成立于一九四六年，它是各国法学工作者和职业的科学的法学专家们团体的国际组织，现任理事会主席是普利特（英）、副主席德拉契纳（意）、秘书长诺德曼（法）、副秘书长莫斯加（波）。
    国际民主法学家协会的组织目的，在协会的会章上这样规定着：
    “（一）在使各国法律工作者和职业的科学的专家们团体，便于密切联系和交换意见，并发展他们的互相了解和友谊的精神；
    （二）在研究和比较各国的法律，以为法律科学的进展而工作，在研究各民主国家间普遍国际法的形成，并且赞助国际法的发展；
    （三）在为实现联合国的目的而合作，并且要求法律工作者们的共同行动，以便：
    （１）在法律上和在实际上，恢复、保卫和发展联合国所指示的民主权利与自由；
    （２）促使国内的和国际的履行关于处罚战犯的计划，并在国内法上和在国际法上根绝法西斯的残余和其他反民主的思想；
    （３）把法律工作者的力量和一切其他团体的力量联合起来，俾在每一国家内保卫民主原则，在国际关系上尊重法律，并建立坚强和永久的和平；
    （４）增进全世界民族的独立，并且反对在法律上无论国内的和国际的及在实际上对于这样独立加以任何的限制。”
    从一九四六年以来，国际民主法学家协会就始终不懈地为自己的组织目的而战斗着。协会提出了庄严而响亮的口号：“用法律维护和平！”号召它的会员——各国的法学者团体，团结一切法学工作者为世界和平与人民民主服务。协会在为维护联合国宪章、雅尔达协定与波茨坦宣言的法律地位，在为保护世界和平与人民民主权利的每一个斗争中，揭露并抗议以美帝国主义为首的世界侵略集团的疯狂的战争计划、蹂躏人民的基本权利、干涉与压迫殖民地民族独立运动的罪行，声援这些国家的人民争取和平民主与民族独立运动，为这些国家的和平民主战士与政治难民的被迫害事件进行正义的辩护。国际民主法学家协会和它的会员曾经致函联合国秘书长赖伊，抗议美国武装干涉朝鲜；曾经致函纽伦堡军事法庭，控诉美帝国主义及其各国帮凶们的罪恶的战争活动，要求纽伦堡军事法庭的法官们同意布达佩斯宣言反对使用原子武器的原则；曾经抗议西德和日本占领当局不顾全世界亿万人民的愤怒，不顾联合国宪章的尊严，为着另一个侵略战争的目的，重新武装西德，武装日本，大量释放德国和日本的战争罪犯；曾经抗议那个蹂躏基本人权、把美国引向法西斯化的恶名昭著的蒙特、麦加伦法案；曾经抗议希腊君主法西斯政府以虚拟的罪名监禁屠杀成百成千个自一九四○年来为希腊的独立自由与纳粹德国及美英干涉者血战的爱国志士的暴行。
    国际民主法学家协会的工作，表明自己是一个真正的和平战士，它的“用法律维护和平”的正义行动，是与人类命运、人的良心血肉相连的，它以国际民主法学工作者团结的力量，为世界和平与人民民主权利辩护，也就是为人类免于另一次毁灭性的战争灾难，为创造社会物质文明的人类真正的进步力量——劳动人民的基本权利辩护。因之协会的工作受到世界亿万人民的拥护和尊敬，而和平人类的公敌，以美国帝国主义为首的侵略集团及其各国的帮凶们也就更加仇视协会，并用种种卑鄙手段去迫害它。被美国帝国主义篡夺的联合国，污蔑协会为维护法律、维护和平的一切努力系“滥用咨询权”，而可耻地取消协会作为联合国社会经济理事会的咨询机关的权利；随着，法国政府禁止协会在巴黎设立总部。联合国和法国政府无理地拒绝了协会与它的各国会员团体以及国际学生联合会等抗议关于协会的违法决议与禁令，再一次证明了：帝国主义集团及其帮凶们对协会的攻击和迫害，实际是攻击和迫害联合国宪章，攻击和迫害人类和平与民主权利。
    但是，世界各民族人民维护联合国宪章，保卫和平与民主的意志与毅力是颠扑不破的，它正在世界和平堡垒——苏联的周围日益巩固地团结起来，成为一个巨大的战斗力量！国际民主法学家协会“用法律维护和平”的斗争，也在世界和平大会的旗帜下继续发展着。
    一九五○年十一月二十三、二十四日，国际民主法学家协会继第二届世界和平大会闭幕之后，于波兰首都华沙召开理事会议，参加理事会议主席团者有苏、中、英、美、法、意、波、印、伊朗和南美国家等国的代表。我国出席二届世界和平大会代表钱端升教授代表中国新法学研究会参加了理事会议，并为主席团之一。
    协会理事会华沙会议要求各国会员团体团结最广大的——一切赞成民主与和平的法学工作者，为实现二届世界和平大会决议与协会理事会华沙会议决议而奋斗。
    中国新法学研究会于一九四九年参加国际民主法学家协会，成为其中重要的一员。以毛泽东主席为首的中华人民共和国，是一个将近五万万人口的伟大国家，她在国际事务中有着异常重大的影响，因之协会秘书长诺德曼与莫斯加在华沙会议上曾多次表示要求我会与协会加强联系，加强文化交流，要求我会首先在亚洲民主法学工作者为和平与民主的事业中做更多的工作。中国新法学研究会在传达讨论协会华沙会议的决议时，深切地认识到当前全中国人民以强大的决心与雄伟的姿态所进行的抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命的斗争，是世界人民为和平与民主的斗争的一个重要的方面。
    中国新法学研究会为了认真地执行国际民主法学家协会华沙会议决议，要求它的会员团结一切爱和平爱祖国的法学工作者，和全国人民在一起，积极参加抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命的工作，保卫中国人民的胜利，保卫世界和平！
