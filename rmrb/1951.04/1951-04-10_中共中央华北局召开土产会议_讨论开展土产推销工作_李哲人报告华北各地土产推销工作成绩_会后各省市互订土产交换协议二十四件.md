Xinhua News Agency, April 9th—The North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee held the second North China Five Provinces and Two Cities Native Produce Conference in Beijing in late March under the auspices of the Financial and Economic Work Committee. The conference summarized the achievements and experiences in promoting native produce in the entire region from last winter to this spring, discussed how to open up sales channels for unsalable native produce, and how to further carry out the native produce promotion work for 1951. After the meeting, representatives from provinces and cities signed 24 native produce exchange agreements with each other.

　　Li Zheren, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Work Committee of the North China Bureau, made a report and summary at the meeting. In his report, Li Zheren pointed out that since last winter, the promotion of native produce has become a large-scale mass movement in North China, and has achieved great success. According to statistics, so far, the sales volume of 90 kinds of native products in Pingyuan Province has reached 90 percent, of which 16 kinds of native products such as pig bristles, wool, cowhide, peach kernels, and Codonopsis pilosula have been completely sold out; in Hebei and Shanxi provinces, except for unsold medicinal materials, saltpeter, crude saltpeter, and gypsum, most of the other mountain products have also been sold out. By the end of February this year, it is estimated that more than 70 percent of the native products in the entire region have been sold, with a total value of nearly 5 billion catties of grain. He pointed out that the large-scale sales of native products have increased the purchasing power of farmers, expanded the market for industrial products, and enlivened the urban and rural economy, making both farmers and merchants happy. Since last fall, industrial products in various cities in North China have been in short supply, and the promotion of native produce has played a significant role. He also pointed out that the above-mentioned achievements in promoting native produce in the North China region are due to the importance attached to the promotion of native produce by cadres of Party, government, and economic departments at all levels. In order to open up sales channels for native produce, Party and government organs at all levels have held a series of native produce conferences and various forms of material exchange conferences. Experience has proved that these meetings are the most important method for solving the problem of promoting native produce. Experience has also proved that in organizing the promotion of native produce, specific measures must be formulated according to sales conditions; for example, commercial grain, cash crops, and export agricultural and sideline products should be pre-purchased by state trading companies through cooperatives; for mountain products that are not easy to sell, state-owned trading companies should take the lead in organizing cooperatives and private merchants and vendors to solve the sales problem. In organizing the promotion of native produce, it is also necessary to quickly restore the old commercial network and establish a new commercial network, promote the trade contract system, and give full play to the role of private merchants. In addition, it is also extremely important to organize mass near-distance material exchanges and open up a broad inland market. For example, among the 19 kinds of native products in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, those promoted by the masses accounted for 70 percent. In the work of promoting native produce, in order to overcome the shortage of transportation capacity, it is necessary to vigorously organize mass transportation. Last fall, Hebei Province organized more than 15,000 private carts and more than 3,700 wooden boats, which played a significant role in promoting native produce and supplying materials.

　　Li Zheren pointed out in his summary of the meeting that there are still some shortcomings in the current work of promoting native produce in the North China region. For example, the development of the work is unbalanced, there is not enough enthusiasm to find sales channels for slow-moving goods, and the planning for long-term operations is poor. In order to strengthen the leadership in the promotion of native produce, it is recommended that the government establish a North China Native Produce Company, and each province and city send resident sales teams to further organize the exchange of native produce between the five provinces, two cities, and Inner Mongolia. Each province and city must hold seminars to study ways to promote the sale of slow-moving native produce. Various methods can be adopted to promote the sale of slow-moving native produce, such as mobilizing and organizing the strength of private merchants, restoring old commercial relationships, adjusting the prices of native produce and improving product quality, and holding native produce exhibitions. The North China Native Produce Exhibition is planned to be held in Beijing in June. In order to further promote the exchange of native produce between the north and the south, it is planned to organize a North China Native Produce Sales Delegation at the end of May to visit major and medium-sized cities in East China, Central China, and South China with samples to actively promote native produce. It is also recommended that the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee host a North-South Medicinal Materials Conference, inviting merchants from both the north and the south to participate in order to solve the sales problem of medicinal materials. In order to put the management of native produce on the right track, it is recommended that each region formulate a native produce promotion plan for 1951 based on the production, transportation, and sales situation.

　　Finally, the participating cadres listened to the reports of Bo Yibo, Secretary of the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, and Liu Lantao, Third Secretary and Director of the Financial and Economic Work Committee. In his report, Bo Yibo pointed out that although the North China region has made great achievements in promoting native produce, it should not be complacent. Due to the development of urban-rural material exchange, new situations have emerged: the market for industrial products has expanded, but there are not enough industrial products to supply the market, and means of production such as agricultural tools are even more lacking. If this problem is not solved in time, new difficulties will arise in urban-rural exchange. Therefore, in the future, provinces and cities are required to boldly and systematically support the development of local industry and handicraft production in order to solve the problem of insufficient industrial products. In his report, Liu Lantao emphasized that cadres engaged in economic work should not only be proficient in business but also pay special attention to studying politics, theory, and policies, spur themselves on, constantly move forward, and prevent and overcome the shortcomings of neglecting politics and neglecting the study of theory and policies.

　　中共中央华北局召开土产会议
　  讨论开展土产推销工作
　  李哲人报告华北各地土产推销工作成绩
　  会后各省市互订土产交换协议二十四件
    【新华社九日讯】中共中央华北局财政经济工作委员会三月下旬在北京召开的华北五省二市第二次土产会议，总结了全区从去年冬天到今年春天推销土产的成就和经验，讨论了如何为滞销的土产打开销路以及如何进一步开展一九五一年的土产推销工作等问题。会后省与省或省与市的代表之间相互订立了土产交换协议二十四件。
    会议由华北局财政经济工作委员会副主任李哲人作报告和总结。李哲人在报告中指出：去冬以来，推销土产在华北已成为大规模的群众运动，并且已取得很大成绩。据统计，到目前为止，平原省九十种土产的销售量已达百分之九十，其中猪鬃、羊毛、牛皮、桃仁、党参等十六种土产且已全部销出；河北、山西两省除药材、皮硝、火硝、石膏滞销外，其余山货也大部销完。到今年二月底，估计全区土产已销出百分之七十以上，总值近五十亿斤粮食。他指出：土产的大量销出，提高了农民的购买力，扩大了工业品的市场，活跃了城乡经济，农民和商人皆大欢喜。自去年秋季到现在，华北各城市的工业品都是供不应求，推销土产是起了很大作用的。他又指出：华北区推销土产有以上成绩，是由于各级党、政、经济部门干部重视了土产的推销工作。为了打开土产的销路，各地党、政机关曾召开一系列的土产会议和各种不同形式的物资交流会议。经验证明：这些会议是解决推销土产问题的最重要的方法。经验也证明，组织土产推销，必须根据销售情况，订出具体办法；如商品粮、经济作物和出口的农副产品，应由国家贸易公司经过合作社向农民预购；不好销的山货，主要依靠国营贸易公司带头，组织合作社和私商小贩解决销路问题。在组织土产推销工作中，又必须迅速恢复旧商业网和建立新商业网，推广贸易合同制，发挥私商的作用。此外，组织群众性的近距离物资交换，开辟广阔的内地市场，也极为重要。如河北省邯郸专区十九种土产中，群众推销的即占百分之七十。在推销土产工作中，为了克服运输力的不足，必须大力组织群众性的运输。去秋河北省组织私人的大车一万五千多辆、木船三千七百多只，对于推销土产和供应物资起了很大作用。
    李哲人在会议总结中指出：目前华北区推销土产工作中，仍存在若干缺点。如工作发展不平衡，积极为冷货找销路的劲头不大，长期经营的计划性差。为加强领导土产的推销，建议政府成立华北土产公司，各省、市互派常驻推销小组，进一步组织五省二市和内蒙古之间的土产交流。各省、市必须召开座谈会，研究推销滞销土产办法。在推销滞销土产时，可采用各种方法，如动员组织私商力量，恢复旧的商业关系，调整土产价格和提高产品质量，举办土产展览会等。华北区的土产展览会计划于六月间在北京举办。为了进一步沟通南北土产交流，并拟在五月底组织华北土产推销团，携带样品访问华东、华中、华南各大、中城市，积极推销土产，并建议由天津市人民政府财政经济委员会主持召开南北药材会议，邀请南北药商参加，解决药材的销路问题。为了使土产的经营工作走上正轨，建议各地根据产、运、销情况，制定一九五一年的土产推销计划。
    最后，与会干部听取了中共中央华北局书记薄一波、第三书记兼财政经济工作委员会主任刘澜涛的报告。薄一波在报告中指出：华北区推销土产虽然成绩很大，但不要因此而自满。由于城乡物资交流的开展，新的情况已经出现：工业品的市场扩大了，却没有足够供应市场的工业品，农具等生产资料更为缺乏。这个问题如不及时解决，城乡交流将会发生新的困难。因此，今后要求各省、市放手地和有计划地扶助地方工业和手工业生产的发展，以解决工业品不足的问题。刘澜涛在报告中强调指出：做经济工作的干部除精通业务外，还要特别注意学习政治、理论和政策，鞭策自己，不断前进，防止和克服忽视政治和忽视学习理论、政策的缺点。
