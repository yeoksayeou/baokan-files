　　The US-Drafted "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan" Is a Plan to Plunder Colonies
　　Cheng Guangrui
    The "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan" unilaterally drawn up by the United States completely violates all international agreements on the Japanese issue. On the issue of territory, it blatantly attempts to infringe upon the sacred sovereignty of China and the Soviet Union. This proves that this illegal draft is actually an imperialist treaty of aggression; American imperialism is attempting to use this treaty to open up channels for the United States to expand its aggression in Asia. In Chapter III, "Territory," of this draft, as in other chapters, the United States tries its best to use very vague wording to conceal its aggressive plot, but this despicable conspiracy cannot be concealed.

    The Cairo Declaration, signed on December 1, 1943, by China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, clearly stipulated: "The purpose of the war being waged by the three great Allies is to restrain and punish the aggression of Japan. The three Allies seek no aggrandizement for themselves and have no intention of territorial expansion. It is their purpose that Japan shall be stripped of all the islands in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied since the beginning of the first World War in 1914, and that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa, and the Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China. Japan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed. The aforesaid three great powers, mindful of the enslavement of the people of Korea, are determined that in due course Korea shall become free and independent." However, the United States is attempting to undermine this sacred provision. In Chapter III, "Territory," of the draft, it has tampered with this provision by changing it to "Japan renounces all right, title and claim to Korea, Formosa and the Pescadores." But to whom will these territories, abandoned by Japan, be handed over? The draft deliberately equivocates on this point, which very clearly exposes the United States' ambition to seize our territory of Taiwan and the Pescadores and to continue its aggression against Korea.

    While launching the war of aggression against Korea last June, the United States also sent its Seventh Fleet to invade and occupy our territory of Taiwan. In mid-April, the US Seventh Fleet even conducted exercises in the Taiwan Strait and dispatched large numbers of aircraft to conduct reconnaissance and strafing along our Fujian coast. The criminal facts of the United States' serious violation of China's territorial sovereignty are obvious to all. Today, the United States is attempting to brazenly erase China's sovereignty over Taiwan and the Pescadores without a trace in the "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan" it has formulated, in order to leave a loophole for its open occupation. This sinister conspiracy of American imperialism is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. This will only arouse greater anger among the Chinese people to eliminate the American aggressors thoroughly at an early date.

    The ambition of the United States does not stop there. It is even attempting to use this "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan" to completely obliterate the freedom and independence of Korea. The purpose of the United States in launching the war of aggression against Korea is to enslave the Korean people and turn Korea into its colony and a springboard for attacking China. Now, this criminal ambition of the United States is completely written into this US-made "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan." In this draft, the United States only stipulates that "Japan renounces all right, title and claim to Korea...," but it makes no mention of the issue of Korea's freedom and independence. Needless to say, Korea is being "abandoned" as a Japanese colony, and the United States will take over Korea as a colony. Isn't this the intention of the United States in completely violating the provisions of the Cairo Declaration on the Korean issue in its draft? This shows that the American aggressors, who have suffered a serious defeat on the Korean battlefield, are still not reconciled to their defeat. They still want to continue their aggression against Korea and expand the war from Korea.

    As for the provision in the US draft that "Japan will restore to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics the southern part of Sakhalin and all islands adjacent to it, and will cede to the Soviet Union the Kurile Islands," this is completely a deceptive trick. On the surface, this provision seems to be no different from the provisions of the Yalta Agreement, but this trick is immediately exposed in the provisions of Chapter VIII of the draft. Chapter VIII, "Final Clauses," stipulates that "This Treaty shall not confer any rights, legal basis or benefit on any State not a party to this Treaty." On this point, the drafter of this draft, the warmonger Dulles, said even more bluntly in a speech on the Japanese peace treaty issue delivered at Whittier College in California on March 31: "We suggest that any ratification of Soviet sovereignty should depend on whether the Soviet Union participates in the treaty." That is to say, if the Soviet Union does not sign the treaty manufactured by the United States according to the will of the United States, the United States can violate the promises of the Yalta Agreement, and can use this treaty to instigate Japan to forcibly occupy these islands at any time. The insidious intention of the United States is obvious. It not only attempts to deprive the legitimate rights and interests of the Allied countries that fought against Japan and infringe upon the territorial sovereignty of the Soviet Union, but also wants to drag its tool of aggression, the Japanese reactionaries, into a future anti-Soviet war.

    At the same time, the United States, in violation of the promise made in the Atlantic Charter and the Cairo Declaration that the Allies had no intention of expanding their territory, is also attempting to seize the Ryukyu Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, and other Japanese islands under the guise of the pleasant-sounding term "trusteeship." The draft stipulates that "The United States may propose to the United Nations that the Ryukyu Islands south of 29 degrees north latitude, the Ogasawara Islands, including Rosario Island (i.e., Nishinoshima), the Volcano Islands (i.e., Iwo Jima), Parese Vela (i.e., Okinotorishima) and Marcus Island (i.e., Minamitorishima) shall be placed under the trusteeship system with the United States as the administering authority. Japan will agree to any such proposal. Until such a proposal is made and a positive resolution is obtained, the United States shall have the right to exercise any and all administrative, legislative, and judicial powers over the territory of the above-mentioned islands, including their territorial waters, and over their residents." In fact, the United States has already militarized these islands and has already established a major US air force base on Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands; and recently it has arbitrarily and illegally established a government in the Ryukyu Islands.

    In addition to having already obtained "the Pacific Islands formerly under Japanese mandate," the United States also wants to acquire "all rights associated with the mandate system or acquired by reason of the activities of Japanese nationals in the Antarctic region," and at the same time wants to seize the Ryukyu Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, and other Japanese islands. This means that the United States wants to seize and plunder all territorial rights and interests in the peace treaty with Japan. Even this seizure and plunder includes the Japanese mainland. Because according to the spirit of the American "draft," Japan will be completely transformed into a legitimate colony of the United States. The imperialist predatory ambition of the United States has truly reached an unbridled level.

    In short, the provisions on "Territory" in the US "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan" are completely a plan to plunder colonies, and have nothing in common with the spirit of international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Proclamation. No matter how the United States plays tricks with words, it cannot conceal its conspiracy to expand its territory and continue its aggression against China, Korea, and all of Asia. The struggle of the people of China, the Soviet Union, Japan, and the world against a separate peace with Japan and the rearmament of Japan will completely crush this criminal conspiracy in the American "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan"!

　　美制“对日和约草案”是一套掠夺殖民地的计划
    程光锐
    美国片面制订的“对日和约草案”，完全违背了对日问题的各项国际协议；在领土问题上，公然企图侵犯中国和苏联的神圣主权。这就证明了：这个非法的草案，实际上是一个帝国主义的侵略条约；美国帝国主义是企图用这个条约为美国在亚洲扩大侵略打开通路的。在这个草案的第三章“领土”中，和在其他的各章中一样，美国尽量用些十分含糊的字句来掩饰它的侵略阴谋，但是这种卑劣的阴谋是掩盖不住的。
    一九四三年十二月一日由中美英三国签订的开罗宣言中曾明确规定：“我三大盟国此次进行战争的目的，在于制止及惩罚日本之侵略。三国决不为自身图利，亦无拓展领土之意。三国之宗旨在剥夺日本自一九一四年第一次世界大战开始以后在太平洋所夺得或占领之一切岛屿，在使日本所窃取于中国之领土，例如满洲、台湾、澎湖列岛等，归还中国。日本亦将被逐出以其武力或贪欲所攫取之所有土地，我三大盟国轸念朝鲜人民所受之奴隶待遇，决定在相当期间，使朝鲜自由独立。”然而，美国竟企图破坏这一神圣的规定，在草案第三章“领土”中，把这个规定篡改为“日本放弃对朝鲜，台湾及澎湖列岛的一切权利，权利上的根据与要求”。但是，这些由日本放弃的领土将交给谁呢？草案上却故意含糊其词，这就非常明显地暴露了美国企图霸占我国领土台湾、澎湖列岛和继续侵略朝鲜的野心。
    美国于去年六月发动侵朝战争的同时，并派其第七舰队侵占我国领土台湾；本月中旬，美国第七舰队竟在台湾海峡演习，并派大批飞机到我福建沿海侦察和扫射。美国这种严重侵犯我国领土主权的罪恶事实，是人所共见的。今天，美国竟企图在它所制订的“对日和约草案”上横蛮地将中国对台湾、澎湖列岛的主权不着痕迹地予以勾消，以为它公开侵占留下伏笔。美国帝国主义的这种险恶阴谋是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。这只有激起中国人民更大的愤怒，把美国侵略者早日彻底消灭。
    美国的野心还不仅如此，它更企图利用这份“对日和约草案”完全抹杀朝鲜的自由独立。美国发动侵略朝鲜战争的目的，就是要奴役朝鲜人民，变朝鲜为它的殖民地和进攻中国的跳板。如今，美国的这个罪恶野心竟完完全全地写在这一份美制的“对日和约草案”上了。在这草案上，美国只规定了“日本放弃对朝鲜……的权利，权利上的根据与要求”，但对朝鲜的自由独立问题却绝口不谈。不用问，朝鲜是被当作日本的殖民地而“放弃”的，而美国也就要把朝鲜当作殖民地来接收了。美国在它的草案上完全违背开罗宣言关于朝鲜问题的规定，其用意不就在此吗？这就显示出：在朝鲜战场上遭受了严重挫败的美国侵略者依然尚未死心，它还要继续侵略朝鲜，并要从朝鲜来扩大战争。
    至于美国草案中所谓“日本将库页岛的南部及其附近的一切岛屿归还苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟，并将千岛群岛移交苏联。”的规定，完全是骗人的障眼法。在表面上看来，这项规定似乎和雅尔达协定的规定并无不同，但是这个骗术，马上就在草案第八章的规定中被自己拆穿了。草案第八章“最后条款”中规定“对任何未经签字，批准或加入本条约之国家，本条约将不给予任何权利、法律基础或利益。”关于这一点，这个草案的起草人、战争贩子杜勒斯于三月三十一日在加利福尼亚州魏蒂尔学院发表的关于对日和约问题的演说中说得更露骨，他说：“我们建议，任何批准苏联主权的和约应视苏联是否参加和约而定。”这就是说，如果苏联不依照美国的意旨在美国制造的条约上签字，美国就可以违反雅尔达协定的诺言，就可以根据这个条约唆使日本随时强占这些岛屿。美国的毒狠的用心是显而易见的，它不仅企图剥夺曾与日本作战的盟国的正当权益，侵犯苏联的领土主权，而想把他的侵略工具日本反动派拖入未来的反苏战争中。
    同时，美国更违反了大西洋宣言和开罗宣言中所规定的同盟国无意扩张领土的诺言，又企图在“托管”的好听名词下，强占琉球群岛、小笠原群岛和其他的日本岛屿。草案中规定“美国得向联合国建议将北纬二十九度以南的琉球群岛、小笠原群岛、包括罗萨里奥岛（即西之岛）、火山群岛（即琉璜群岛），巴列斯维拉岛（即冲之鸟岛）及马尔库斯岛（即南鸟岛）均列入以美国为管理当局的托管制度。日本同意此类建议之任何一项。在此种建议提出并得到肯定决议以前，美国将有权对于上述诸岛的领土，包括其领海在内，和对其居民实施一切和任何行政，立法，与司法权力。”事实上，美国早已把这些岛屿加以军事基地化，早已在琉球群岛中的冲绳岛上建立了主要的美国空军基地；并且最近又擅自在琉球群岛非法设立了政府。
    美国除了已取得了“以前在日本委任统治下的太平洋各岛屿”之外，而且还要取得“与委任统治制度相关联的或由于日本国民在南极地区的活动而取得的一切权利”，同时又要夺去琉球群岛、小笠原群岛和其他日本岛屿。这就是说美国要霸占与掠夺一切在对日和约上的领土权益。甚至这种霸占与掠夺是包括日本本土在内的。因为根据美国“草案”的精神，日本将完全变为美国合法的殖民地。美国的这种帝国主义的掠夺野心，真是达到了无法无天的程度了。
    总之，美国的“对日和约草案”中关于“领土”的条款完全是一套掠夺殖民地的计划，与开罗宣言、雅尔达协定和波茨坦公告等国际协定的精神毫无相同之点。美国无论在字句上怎样玩弄花样，都不能掩饰得住它的扩张领土与继续侵略中国、朝鲜和全亚洲的阴谋。中国、苏联、日本以及全世界人民反对单独对日媾和与重新武装日本的斗争，必将彻底粉碎美国“对日和约草案”中的这种罪恶阴谋！
