I am Gu Ren'en, also known as Gu Yunpeng, with the childhood name of Gu Yuese, and I am 45 years old. I am from Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province. I am an American spy lurking within Christianity, wearing the legal guise of religion, and using preaching as a cover for engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. After graduating from Hangzhou Huilan Middle School at the age of fifteen, I applied to the Shanghai Star Film Company as a trainee actor. By the age of twenty-one, I had become a somewhat famous actor. At this time, I became acquainted with some of the big gangsters in Shanghai. Because they supported me, I dared to be domineering and commit all kinds of evil deeds.

On March 21, 1930, when I was twenty-four years old, I attempted suicide in the Huangpu River in Shanghai because of a broken heart. I happened to be rescued by Maxon, a chaplain from an American naval warship, who ordered sailors to rescue me and send me to Renji Church Hospital, where I was revived. From then on, I believed in Jesus and took preaching as my profession. The American spy Maxon took advantage of his "lifesaving grace" to instill counter-revolutionary ideas in me, until I was completely exploited by him and became a traitor to the country and a criminal to society.

First, he lured me with economic benefits. For example, in 1932, when I opened a church in Shanghai, he often went to preach and donate money. Later, he instilled in me the idea of "anti-communism and pro-Americanism." Since the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, he freely entered and exited the Japanese-occupied areas to preach. At this time, he often spoke reactionary words such as "the Communist Party persecutes the church, killing and shedding blood." After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he entered a Japanese concentration camp. After the Japanese surrendered on August 15, 1945, he was released. We met again. He often gave me clippings and publications that slandered the Communist Party. Due to his cultivation and instillation, I developed extremely reactionary ideas of hating the Communist Party and worshiping the United States. In the end, he controlled and exploited me to achieve the goal of undermining the Chinese people's revolution.

I remember very clearly that April 8, 1948, was the day Maxon returned to the United States from Shanghai. Before leaving, he specifically asked me to stay with him for four days. During this period, he said to me, "I saved your life. I treat you like a son who has been brought back to life. You should completely believe my words." I was moved to tears at the time and worshiped him as my godfather. Then he gave me a reactionary book called "The Inside Story of the Communist Party" and said to me, "You must read this book carefully. In the future, when the Communist Party comes, you can use the opportunity of preaching to carry out anti-Communist propaganda." At that time, I felt that every word he said was the true meaning, and I was grateful for his lifesaving grace, so I completely accepted it. At that time, he also wanted a photo of me, which was later published in American newspapers, saying that I was the best preacher in China. At that time, I felt it was an unparalleled honor.

After the liberation of Shanghai and other parts of the country, I followed the instructions of the American spy Maxon, on the one hand, calling for the great union and great unity of Christianity; on the other hand, using preaching as a cover for carrying out espionage activities. In order to deceive more people into joining Christianity and increase our strength, I came up with the trick of "God healing diseases" to deceive people. I used this trick to exploit the backward masses and the poor and sick who lacked scientific knowledge. Many people signed up, and among them, there must be half-deaf, half-mute, half-paralyzed, and half-blind people. Generally, when people sign up, they must say that their illness is very serious. I then added mental threats, saying, "If your faith is not sincere, you cannot be cured. Even if you are cured at the time, it will recur." I also took advantage of the psychology and mental effects of the patients. In this way, patients were afraid to say "my faith is not sincere" during prayer, so they said "I am cured." At this time, the news was broadcasted to the outside world through loudspeakers, and more people were deceived. If it didn't work, I would say, "This is because your faith is not sincere," so I could avoid responsibility. After this method was well thought out, I boldly used this trick. First, it was implemented in Hangzhou on May 6, 1950, and then in Tianjin, Suzhou, Wuxi, Shanghai, and other places. This method did deceive many backward masses. This gave me the opportunity and conditions to carry out counter-revolutionary propaganda, and my counter-revolutionary courage became even more rampant. This time to Qingdao, I also brought this set of methods with me.

This time to Qingdao was planned by the imperialist elements Wang Deren, Wang Wenkang, and Wang Jifa in Qingdao Christianity. Hu Guangchun sent a telegram in his name to invite me, and Zhang Jiaxin wrote a letter to send me 300,000 yuan in travel expenses. On February 24, I came to Qingdao from Tianjin. After arriving, Zhang Zijie specially took me from Wang Wenkang's house to his own office at No. 4 Longshan Road to live in, and gave me his church to preach in, actively supporting and supporting me. At noon on the 25th, Wang Deren and others invited me to dinner, and told me a set of methods for sabotage activities.

In order to encourage them and take the opportunity to carry out espionage activities, I took the following measures:

First, I emphasized in my sermons that Christianity should be united, because unity is strength, so as not to be exploited by outsiders (outsiders referring to the People's Government).

Second, I took the opportunity to spread rumors and engage in anti-propaganda, undermining the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend the country. During this period, I fabricated the following rumors:

(1) Regarding the issue of peace and war: I said that Jesus is the liberator of mankind, advocating pacifism, opposing bloodshed, and opposing war, thus paralyzing the audience, denying that Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are leading the people to liberation, and denying that the People's Government is leading the Chinese people to strive for peace. Using the general slogan of opposing bloodshed and opposing war to eliminate the audience's will to resist the aggressors, to achieve the purpose of undermining the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend the country.

(2) Citing the phrase "speak appropriately" in the Bible, I promoted that people should listen to both sides, not just one side. Implying that we should not only listen to the Soviet Union and the Communist Party, but also listen to the United States. This is to oppose the "leaning to one side" peaceful policy advocated by the People's Government and spread pro-American sentiments.

(3) Citing the Bible's metaphor of "the ox knows its master, and the donkey knows its master's trough," I compared Chairman Mao to the master and the laboring masses to cattle and horses, so as to make the masses complain about Chairman Mao.

(4) I even more arrogantly spread the rumor: "When I preached and healed diseases in Shanghai, the Military Control Commission sent a red guard car to the entrance of the church, and several soldiers of the People's Liberation Army entered the venue. Later, when they saw that I had cured the disease, they admired me very much and left." To deceive the masses and establish my reactionary prestige.

Third, my set of methods deceived many people, with the largest number reaching more than 4,000. I felt that I had a reactionary base, so I implemented the trick of "healing diseases and saving people." Wang Deren, Wang Wenkang, Wang Jifa, Zhang Zijie and others, in order to deceive more people and increase their strength, also sympathized with and supported this scam. Registration began on March 6, and more than 1,700 people signed up. I thought I was very proud, but I didn't know that the more people I deceived, the deeper my sins were.

Since the American spy Maxon returned to the United States, I have given him three reports. The first was written on August 29, 1948, reporting that Shanghai had not yet been liberated and everything was normal; the second was written on December 20, 1949; the third was written on December 21, 1950. The last two reports were about the religious policy of the People's Government after liberation and the political and economic situation after liberation.

　　顾犯仁恩的供状
    我叫顾仁恩，又名顾云鹏，乳名顾约瑟，今年四十五岁，浙江省杭州市人。我是一个潜藏在基督教内，披着宗教的合法外衣，以传教为掩护，进行反革命活动的美国特务。我自十五岁毕业于杭州蕙兰中学以后，便投考于上海明星影片公司当练习演员。到二十一岁我便成了稍稍有名的演员。这时便结识了上海的一些大流氓。由于他们给我撑腰，我也就敢横行霸道，无恶不作。
    一九三○年三月二十一日，我二十四岁的时候，因为失恋而投上海黄浦江自杀。当时正遇上美国海军兵舰上的随军牧师麦森，他叫水兵将我救起，送到了仁济教会医院把我救活。从此我就信耶稣教，而以讲道为职业了。美国特务麦森也就利用对我有“救命之恩”，抓紧灌输我以反革命思想，以至最后完全被他利用，成为国家的叛徒与社会上的罪人。
    他对我首先是经济引诱。比如一九三二年，我在上海开办了一所教堂，他便常去讲道捐钱。后来他便灌输我“反共亲美”的思想。自一九三七年日寇侵略中国以后，他自由地出入日本人占领区去传教，这时他便常讲“共产党迫害教会，杀人流血”等反动言论。太平洋战争爆发后，他进入了日寇集中营。一九四五年八月十五日日寇投降后，他被释放。我们又见面了。他经常给我一些关于污蔑共产党的剪报及书刊看。由于他的培养灌输，我便产生了仇恨共产党、崇拜美国的极端反动思想。他最后便控制、利用我，以达到破坏中国人民革命的目的。
    我记得很清楚，一九四八年四月八日是麦森由上海回国的一天。他走前特地找我去与他在一起住了四天。在这期间他对我说：“你的命是我救活的，我待你如同死而复生的儿子一样，你应该完全相信我的话。”我当时感激得流泪，并且拜了他作干爸爸。接着他给我一本“共产党的内幕”的反动书，对我说：“你要好好地看这本书，将来共产党来了，你可借传教的机会作反对共产党的宣传。”我当时觉得他讲的句句是真义，又感他救命之恩，因此便完全领受了。当时他还要了我一张像片去，后来在美国报刊上登了出来，说我是中国最会传教的人。那时我还觉得是无上光荣。
    上海及全国各地相继解放以后，我便根据美国特务麦森的指示，一方面号召基督教大联合大团结；一方面借传教为掩护进行特务活动。为了骗取更多的人加入基督教，增加力量，便想出“上帝治病”的鬼把戏来骗人。这种把戏，我是利用没有科学知识的落后群众及贫病者，他们报名的人多了，其中定有半聋、半哑、半瘫、半瞎的人；而一般人的心理，去报名时一定说病很重，我再加以精神威胁说：“信心不诚即不能医好，当时好了也会再犯”，以及利用病人的心理与精神作用。这样在祈祷时病人怕说“信心不诚”，因此多说“好了”。这时通过扩音器向外广播，受骗的人也就越多了。如果不好，我就说：“这是你的信心不诚”，因此，我可以不负责任。这个办法想周全了，我便大胆施用这种鬼把戏。首先是一九五○年五月六日在杭州施行，继而在天津、苏州、无锡、上海等地施行。这种办法确实骗了不少落后群众。这样就给我以宣传反革命的机会与条件了，我的反革命胆量也就更加狂妄起来了。这次到青岛来，也是带着这一套办法来的。
    这次到青岛来是由青岛基督教内的帝国主义分子王德仁、王文堪、王矶法等主谋，由胡广纯出名打电报请我来的，并由张家新写信寄给我路费人民币三十万元。二月二十四日我由天津来到青岛。来后张子洁又特地把我从王文堪家接到龙山路四号他自己的办公处去住，并把他的教堂让给我传教，对我积极加以拥护与支持。二十五日中午，王德仁等请我吃饭，席间告诉了我一套破坏活动的办法。
    我为了鼓励他们，并乘机进行特务活动，便采取了以下的措施：
    一、在讲道时强调基督教要大团结，因为团结才有力量，免得被外人钻空子（外人指人民政府）。
    二、乘机造谣反宣传，破坏抗美援朝保家卫国运动，在这期间，我造过如下的谣言：
    （１）关于和平与战争问题：我讲耶稣是人类的解放者，是提倡和平主义，反对流血，反对战争，这样麻痹听众，否认毛主席与共产党是领导人民解放的，否认了人民政府领导中国人民争取和平。用笼统的反对流血反对战争的口号来消灭听众对侵略者的抵抗意志，达到破坏抗美援朝保家卫国运动的目的。
    （２）引证圣经上“说话要合宜”的词句，我宣传人要听两面的话，不可听一面的话。暗示不要单听苏联与共产党的话，美国的话也应该听。这样达到反对人民政府所提倡的“一边倒”的和平政策，散布亲美的情绪。
    （３）引证圣经上“牛认识主人，驴认识主人的槽”作譬喻，把毛主席比作主人，把劳苦大众比作牛马，以使群众抱怨毛主席。
    （４）我更狂妄地造谣说：“我在上海讲道治病，军事管制委员会曾派一辆红色警备车开到教堂门口，有几位解放军进入会场，后来见我治好了病，他们也很佩服的走了。”以欺骗群众，树立我的反动威信。
    三、我这套办法又欺骗了不少群众，最多人数到四千多人。我觉得有了反动阵地，于是又施行“治病救人”的鬼把戏。王德仁、王文堪、王矶法、张子洁等为了骗取更多的群众，增加他们的力量，因而也极同情与支持这个骗局。三月六号开始登记，报名的竟达一千七百多名。我自己以为很得意，岂知我骗的人越多，我的罪恶越深重。
    自从美国特务麦森回国后，我曾给他三次报告。第一次是在一九四八年八月二十九日写的，报告上海尚没有解放，一切照常；第二次是在一九四九年十二月二十日写的；第三次在一九五○年十二月二十一日写的。最后两次都是报告解放后人民政府的宗教政策及解放后的政治与经济情况。
