China Association for Promoting Democracy Instructs Local Branches
　  To Popularize the Work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea

　　The China Association for Promoting Democracy held its 19th meeting of the Central Standing Council on March 29th to discuss the March 14th Circular from the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea. Concerning the five suggestions in the Circular regarding popularizing and deepening the patriotic movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, the Association, in light of its specific circumstances, issued work instructions to its local branches, the main contents of which are: 1. The Association's organizations at all levels should, in an organized manner in April, organize our members and friends connected to us, mobilizing people from cultural, educational, scientific and technological fields, industrialists and business people, and people from all walks of life, to hold various small-scale discussion meetings, symposiums, and accusation meetings to discuss the current situation, accuse the Japanese and American invaders and the Japanese and American lackey Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents of persecuting the people, hold signature campaigns in support of the conclusion of a peace treaty, hold votes on the Japanese issue, jointly write letters to the Japanese people opposing the arming of Japan, etc., to promote the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people. 2. It is necessary to strengthen organizational life so that every member can consciously undertake the practical work and propaganda education work of popularizing the resistance against the United States and aid to Korea. Every member should not only take the lead in their own work positions, play an active role in promoting progress in various occasions, but also should often conduct patriotic education to their neighbors, families, relatives, and friends in daily life. Each of our members should identify a specific task, such as writing articles, giving reports, or helping to organize various small gatherings, etc. 3. Comrades in charge of propaganda work in organizations at all levels should regularly and systematically pay attention to collecting and compiling practical and specific patriotic propaganda materials for comrades inside and outside the Association to refer to when conducting propaganda and education work. 4. When carrying out the peace treaty signature campaign, it is necessary to clearly explain its significance to the masses, avoid it becoming a mere formality, and it is best to use voting methods after propaganda and mobilization in various meetings. 5. Through various patriotic propaganda and education activities, do a good job of mobilization, welcome the "May 1st" mass demonstration, and ensure that people from all walks of life understand the significance of this year's "May 1st" mass demonstration, so as to enthusiastically and actively participate in this patriotic action. 6. Each branch should, based on the specific circumstances of the local area, formulate a propaganda work plan for popularizing and deepening the resistance against the United States and aid to Korea within this year before April, and report it to the headquarters. The instructions emphasized: The Circular issued by the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea is a document of great significance, and all comrades of the Association should do their best to fulfill the tasks stipulated in this document: "Ensure that every place and every person in the country receives this patriotic education and can actively participate in this patriotic action."
