　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing: The Southwest Branch of the Supreme People's Court and the Chongqing Municipal People's Court, in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries," recently executed a group of the most heinous counter-revolutionary criminals.

　　Most of these executed counter-revolutionary criminals were long-time evildoers and major executioners with countless debts in blood. For example, Chiang Kai-shek's old special agent Wang Lanji was one of the main culprits of the "March 31st" massacre in Chongqing twenty-four years ago. On March 31, 1927, more than 10,000 Chongqing citizens gathered to protest the bombardment of Nanjing by American and British imperialist warships on March 24 of the same year. Wang Lanji, then serving as the Chief of the Military Law Department of the Chongqing Garrison Command, under the command of Chiang Kai-shek and Sichuan warlord Wang Lingji, led troops and police to suppress the gathered masses, killing more than 500 people and wounding more than 1,000 on the spot. After liberation, Wang gathered more than 2,000 bandits, attempting to create disturbances in the suburbs of Chongqing. The special agent Huang Ruzhang, who had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities for more than 20 years, successively massacred up to 1,000 Communist Party members and progressives. In 1947, when the bandit was the county magistrate of Yuxian County, Henan, he used a铡刀 (铡刀 is a Chinese instrument of execution similar to a guillotine) to execute more than 100 people and bury 28 people alive. Another group consisted of criminals who had long persecuted workers, massively sabotaged factories before liberation, and continued to carry out sabotage activities after liberation. For example, special agents Huang Zhongliang and Qu Ziwei had successively arrested, killed, and framed more than 70 workers. After liberation, they infiltrated the Yuxin Yarn Factory, pretended to be active, and seized the position of standing committee member of the trade union preparatory committee, using their power to secretly carry out sabotage. On the eve of liberation, special agent Chen Yousheng placed a large amount of explosives in the generator and steelmaking furnace of a factory, destroying the machines and killing 17 workers. A group was made up of cultural special agents who sabotaged progressive cultural undertakings and suppressed student movements, such as Zhou Hanmei, who sabotaged the National Salvation Association organized by democratic figures such as Tian Han and Shen Yanbing in Shanghai in 1937. Later, she sabotaged the National Salvation Daily co-founded by Hu Yuzhi and Qian Junrui. In 1939, this criminal colluded with Japanese invaders to carry out pro-Japanese propaganda activities in Shanghai and Hong Kong. In 1940, this criminal served as the Chief of the News Inspection Section of the Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang Central Committee and the Director of the Guidance Section of the News Inspection Bureau of Chiang Kai-shek's Military Affairs Commission in Chongqing, undermining democratic news and publishing undertakings, and guiding various reactionary newspapers in Chongqing to publish anti-communist and anti-people remarks. The special agent Hou Feng, who was deeply hated by the students of the Shapingba district of Chongqing, served as the Dean of Students and Director of the Sanqing Corps at Chongqing University in 1945, carrying out activities to sabotage the student movement. In 1947, the Kuomintang launched the "June 1st" Great Arrest, and more than 50 progressive students from Chongqing University were arrested after being named by this criminal. In the autumn of 1948, this criminal again designated the arrest of more than 100 students.

　　After these counter-revolutionary criminals were sentenced to death, people from all walks of life cheered and were encouraged. Many factories, schools, government offices, and street residents are currently studying documents on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and have already exposed many hidden special agents.

　　重庆市枪决一批反革命罪犯      
    血债累累的匪犯被处死后人民欢呼振奋
    【本报讯】据新华社重庆电：最高人民法院西南分院和重庆市人民法院按照《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》规定，最近曾枪决了一批首恶的反革命罪犯。
    被枪决的这些反革命罪犯，大部分是长期作恶，血债累累的大刽子手。如蒋匪老特务王兰楫，是二十四年前重庆“三、三一”惨案的主要凶犯之一。一九二七年三月三十一日，重庆市民一万多人集会抗议美、英帝国主义军舰于同年三月二十四日炮轰南京的大暴行，王匪兰楫当时任匪重庆市警备司令部军法处长，在蒋匪及四川军阀王陵基指挥下，率领军、警镇压集会群众，当场打死群众五百多人，打伤群众达一千多人。解放后，王匪又密聚土匪二千多人，妄图在重庆市郊骚动。进行反革命活动二十余年的特务黄汝璋，先后屠杀中共党员及进步人士达一千人。一九四七年该匪任匪河南禹县县长时，用铡刀铡死该县人民一百多人，活埋二十八人。另有一批是长期迫害工人和临解放时大肆破坏工厂，解放后仍潜伏进行破坏活动的凶犯。如特务黄仲良、曲兹纬，曾先后捕杀、陷害工人达七十多人，解放后又混入渝新纱厂，伪装积极，窃据工会筹委会常务委员职务，利用职权，暗中进行破坏。特务陈友声解放前夕，以大量炸药安置某厂的发电机和炼钢炉内，炸毁机器，炸死工人十七名。有一批是破坏进步文化事业，镇压学生运动的文化特务，如周匪寒梅一九三七年在上海破坏田汉、沈雁冰等民主人士组织的救亡协会。后又破坏胡愈之、钱俊瑞合办的救亡日报。一九三九年该犯与日寇勾结在上海、香港进行汉奸宣传活动。一九四○年该犯在重庆任国民党中央宣传部新闻检查科长兼蒋匪军委新闻检查局指导科长，摧残民主新闻、书刊事业，并指导重庆市各反动报纸大肆发布反共反人民的言论。为重庆市沙磁区学生恨之入骨的特务侯风，一九四五年即任重庆大学训导长兼三青团干事长，进行破坏学生运动的活动。一九四七年国民党发动“六一”大逮捕，经该犯圈名捕去重庆大学进步学生五十多人。一九四八年秋该犯又指名逮捕学生一百余人。
    这批反革命罪犯被处死刑后，各界人民都欢呼振奋。许多工厂、学校、机关以及街道居民，都正进行镇压反革命文件的学习，并已检举出不少暗藏的特务分子。
