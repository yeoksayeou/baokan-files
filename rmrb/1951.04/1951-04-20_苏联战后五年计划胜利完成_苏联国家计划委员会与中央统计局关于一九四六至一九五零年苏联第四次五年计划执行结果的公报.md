　　[Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th dispatch by TASS]: The Soviet State Planning Committee and the Central Statistical Bureau issued the following communiqué on the results of the implementation of the Fourth (the first post-war) Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union from 1946 to 1950:
　　The post-war Five-Year Plan for the restoration and development of the Soviet national economy from 1946 to 1950, which was adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in March 1946, has been successfully completed, and the main tasks of the plan have been greatly exceeded.

	The completion of the Five-Year Plan in industry:
		The restoration and development of Soviet industry has achieved great success during this Five-Year Plan. The original plan stipulated that by 1950 (the last year of the Five-Year Plan), the total industrial output of the Soviet Union should increase by 48 percent compared with 1940 before the war. In fact, industrial output in 1950 had increased by 73 percent compared with 1940. Soviet industry has completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule - in only four years and three months. The industrial production target for 1950 stipulated in the Five-Year Plan has been exceeded by 17 percent.
		The basis for ensuring the further development of the technical level of various socialist industrial sectors is the adoption of the latest achievements of modern technology.
		The Five-Year Plan's targets for steel and rolled metal production for the iron and steel industry have been exceeded. The production level of rolled ferrous metals for 1950 stipulated in the Five-Year Plan was reached in the third quarter of 1950, and the steel production level was reached in the second quarter of 1950.
		The Ministry of the Iron and Steel Industry has completed the Five-Year Plan for pig iron production. In 1950, the total production of ferrous metals exceeded the pre-war level by 45 percent, while the original target of the Five-Year Plan was to exceed it by 35 percent; pig iron production exceeded the pre-war level by 29 percent, steel production exceeded the pre-war level by 49 percent, and rolled metal exceeded the pre-war level by 59 percent. The southern iron and steel industry, which was completely destroyed during the war, has been restored on a new technological basis, with output higher than before the war. The iron and steel industry in the eastern regions of our country continues to develop. In 1950, pig iron production in the Urals increased 1.6 times compared with 1940, steel production increased 1.7 times, and rolled metal production increased 1.8 times. Pig iron production in Siberia increased by 20 percent, steel production increased by 70 percent, and rolled metal production doubled. The production of ferrous metals has also been organized in Central Asia and Transcaucasia. Although steel and rolled metal have both exceeded the plan, the production of ferrous metals, especially certain rolled metals, still cannot keep up with the increased needs of the national economy.
		The production technology in the iron and steel industry has been improved. The use of oxygen in steelmaking has been mastered. The production of specially shaped rolled metals and various steels used in the manufacture of new machines and tools has been mastered. The mechanization of laborious and arduous work and the automation of production processes have been implemented on a large scale. The use of equipment has also been greatly improved. For example, at the end of 1950, the utilization of the effective volume of blast furnaces in factories under the Ministry of the Iron and Steel Industry increased by 25 percent compared with 1940, and the steel production per square meter of hearth in open-hearth furnaces increased by 33 percent.
		In the non-ferrous metal industry, the production of copper, aluminum, nickel, lead, zinc, and other non-ferrous and rare metals has greatly exceeded the pre-war level due to the establishment of new mines and ore dressing plants, and the improvement of enterprise management. However, the increasing needs of the national economy still require a more rapid increase in the production of non-ferrous metals.
		The Five-Year Plan for coal production has been exceeded. The coal production target for 1950 reached 104 percent of the target set in the Five-Year Plan, an increase of 57 percent over the pre-war level. The mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry reached the 1950 coal production level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan in the fourth quarter of 1949 ahead of schedule. The coal mines in the areas destroyed during the war have been restored. The coal output of the Donets Basin has exceeded the pre-war and Five-Year Plan targets. The Donets Basin has once again become the largest and most mechanized coal-producing area in the country. Coal production in the Moscow Basin has increased more than twofold compared with the pre-war level.
		While the Donets and Moscow Basins were being restored, the coal industry in the Urals, Kuznetsk, Karaganda, and other regions of the country continued to develop. In 1950, coal production in eastern Soviet Union was more than double the pre-war level. The new coal-producing center (Pechora coal-producing area) has been greatly expanded. The production of peat has exceeded the pre-war level. Coal mining, coal cutting and coal transportation, underground transportation, and the work of loading coal into rail vehicles have all been mechanized. New machines have been invented and adopted, which have mechanized the coal loading work in coal mining areas, and have mechanized the coal and stone loading work in preparing coal mining areas. The work of extensively mechanizing mines has begun, and methods of remote control and automatic command of machine and equipment operation are being adopted.
		The task of restoring and developing the petroleum industry under the Five-Year Plan has been exceeded. The oil production in 1950 was 107 percent of the Five-Year Plan target, exceeding the pre-war level by 22 percent. The oil industries in the Maikop and Grozny regions and western Ukraine, which were destroyed during the war, have been completely restored and technically re-equipped. Thanks to successful geological surveys, large deposits of oil and gas have been discovered and are being prepared for exploitation. New oil extraction, drilling and refining technologies are being widely adopted. The production of high-octane aviation gasoline and other aviation oils has been expanded, and the quality of petroleum products has been improved. New refineries with modern Soviet equipment have been established, and huge trunk pipelines have been installed. At the same time, the rapid increase in oil production requires the accelerated establishment of new refineries.
		The importance of the newly developed eastern oil-producing areas has greatly increased. In the Bashkir Autonomous Republic, huge oilfields have been newly opened and refineries have been established. In the Kuibyshev Oblast, and in the Turkmen, Uzbek, and Kazakh Republics, the production and refining of oil have developed rapidly. Huge oil deposits have been discovered in the Tatar Autonomous Republic. The oil production in the eastern region, which accounted for only 12 percent of the total oil production in the Soviet Union in 1940, has now increased to 44 percent.
		The gas industry has been further developed. Several long-distance gas pipelines, such as Saratov-Moscow, Dashava-Kiev, and Kohtla-Järve-Leningrad, have been completed and put into use. The construction of factories producing artificial liquid fuels has been developed.
		The electricity production target stipulated in the Five-Year Plan has been exceeded. The electricity production level for 1950 stipulated in the Five-Year Plan was reached in the fourth quarter of 1949 ahead of schedule. The electricity production in 1950 reached 110 percent of the original target of the Five-Year Plan, exceeding the 1940 level by 87 percent. In the areas destroyed during the war, electricity production has greatly exceeded the 1940 level.
		The following power plants, which were destroyed during the war, have been restored: Donets Basin, Dnepr region, Kiev, Kharkov, Rovno, Odessa, Mykolaiv, Sevastopol, Novorossiysk, Krasnodar, Grozny, Stalingrad, Voronezh, Bryansk, Kalinin, Minsk, Vilnius, Riga, Tallinn, Petrozavodsk and other cities.
		All hydroelectric power plants have been restored, including the six large hydroelectric power plants stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. The Dnepr Lenin Hydroelectric Power Plant has been restored. Many new hydroelectric power plants - Shcherbakov Plant, Niva-1 Plant, Niva-3 Plant, as well as Farkhad, Hrami, Sukhumi, Krasnopolyanskaya, Shirokov and other hydropower stations, have been established and are all in operation. Large-scale construction projects are underway at Verkhnesvir, Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kiymush, Tsimlyanskaya, Matkozhni and other hydroelectric power plants, which guarantee that these power plants can be used in 1951 and 1952. The construction projects of the Gorky Hydroelectric Power Plant on the Volga River and the Molotov Hydroelectric Power Plant on the Kama River have been launched on a large scale. New thermal and power plants, power and heat transmission networks have also been constructed.
		During the period from 1946 to 1950, the latest power technologies were adopted in various power plants. High-pressure steam boilers of Soviet-made steam turbines were installed in various thermal and power plants, including new 25,000-kilowatt high-pressure steam turbines, 100 atmospheric pressure cylindrical boilers with a steam temperature of 510 degrees, and once-through boilers with the same characteristics.
		Hydrogen-cooled generators, high-voltage air switches, high-frequency and other modern protection equipment were also adopted in various power plants; the automation of the combustion process and boiler coal feeding was realized, etc. Two-thirds of the local hydroelectric power plants have automated the operation of the equipment.
		In machine manufacturing, the production tasks of machine tools, mechanical equipment and tools stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, on the whole, have been exceeded by 17 percent. Machine manufacturing production in 1950 was 2.3 times that of 1940. The production level of machine equipment and tools for 1950 stipulated in the Five-Year Plan was reached in the first quarter of 1950 ahead of schedule.
		The increase in the production of machines and equipment is based on new technologies. In various machine manufacturing factories, highly efficient production methods and technological processes have been universally implemented, including: direct production and automatic continuous production methods, welding with automatic and semi-automatic machines after applying solder, hardening parts with high-frequency current, centrifugal casting, die casting, pressing, and high-speed metal cutting methods, etc.
		During the Five-Year Plan, the product list of various departments of the machine industry has been largely revised. About 250 kinds of universal metal-cutting machine tools, more than 1,000 kinds of special and compound machine tools, 23 kinds of automatic and semi-automatic machines, 34 kinds of forging and automatic pressing machines, and powerful wind force casting machines and pressure and centrifugal casting machines have been mastered in production. Twenty-six automatic machine tool continuous production devices and automated factories for producing automobile parts have been established.
		In 1950, the production of metallurgical equipment increased by 3.8 times compared with 1940, the production of steam turbines increased by 1.6 times, and the production of electrical equipment increased by 2 times. Coal mining combined machines, stone loading machines, coal loading machines, deep well drilling equipment, powerful suction mud pumps and a variety of high-efficiency equipment have been manufactured for the fuel industry. The production of oil extraction equipment in 1950 was three times that of 1940.
		The production of new mainline freight locomotives, electric locomotives, diesel locomotives, unloading trucks, all-metal open-top wagons and constant temperature wagons, and all-metal passenger cars has now been mastered and organized to meet the needs of the railway.
		Compared with 1940, the output of tractors in 1950 increased by 2.8 times, combine harvesters by 2.6 times, tractor-drawn plows by 2.1 times, tractor-drawn seeders by 4.5 times, and tractor-drawn cultivators by 2.1 times. The manufacture of more than 150 kinds of high-efficiency new agricultural machines has been mastered and mass production has begun.
		However, the production level that has been reached for electrical equipment, heavy-duty metal cutting machines, forging and pressing equipment, complex equipment used in the oil refining industry, and certain types of instruments cannot meet the expanded needs of the national economy.
		In the chemical industry, the Five-Year Plan stipulated that it should exceed the pre-war level by 50 percent in 1950. In fact, the output of the chemical industry exceeded the pre-war level by 80 percent. In 1950, the production of nitrogenous fertilizers exceeded the pre-war level by 1.2 times, and the production of potash fertilizers exceeded by 40 percent, higher than the amount stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. Phosphate fertilizers exceeded by 90 percent. The production of synthetic rubber also increased compared with the pre-war period.
		The production of the synthetic fiber industry, plastics, paint industry, pharmaceutical industry and other chemical industry sectors has increased a lot, and many new product manufacturing methods have been mastered. The dye production stipulated in the Five-Year Plan has been exceeded. In 1950, the brand of dyes has increased to 320 kinds, while in 1940 it was 186 kinds. The production of high-quality, never-fading dyes has increased. The manufacturing technology of color photographic film has been completely mastered.
		The production of building materials has exceeded the pre-war level. Compared with 1940, the output of cement increased by 80 percent, and window glass increased by 90 percent.
		The 1950 cement production target stipulated in the Five-Year Plan was completed by 101 percent in the Soviet Union Building Materials Industry Department. For the whole Soviet Union, it was completed by 97 percent. The brick and tile production target stipulated in the Five-Year Plan has not been fully achieved. The production of building materials and the quality of products are still far behind the growing needs of the national economy.
		In the timber industry, the timber collected in 1950 increased by 36 percent compared with 1940, but the task stipulated in the Five-Year Plan was not completed. The task stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for supplying machines and equipment to the timber industry has been exceeded, but due to the failure to make good use of these equipment, the rate of increase in labor productivity in the timber industry during the Five-Year Plan was insufficient.
		The production of paper in 1950 increased by 47 percent compared with 1940.
		During the period from 1946 to 1950, the restoration and development of the textile, clothing, knitting, footwear and other light industry sectors proceeded rapidly. In 1950, the output of these light industry sectors increased by 17 percent compared with 1940.
		The production of major light industry items increased during the Five-Year Plan as follows: cotton fabrics by 1.4 times, woolen fabrics by 1.9 times, socks by 4.2 times, leather shoes by 2.2 times, and rubber shoes by 6 times. However, the production tasks of cotton fabrics and shoes stipulated in the Five-Year Plan have not been completed. The quality of fabrics, clothing, knitwear and boots has been greatly improved, and the variety has also greatly increased.
		The output of major products of the food industry has been greatly increased in the past five years. In 1950, butter production exceeded the pre-war level by 57 percent, vegetable oil and other fats exceeded by 10 percent, fresh meat by 7 percent, fish catch by 27 percent, various sausages by 20 percent, canned food by 48 percent, sugar by 17 percent, confectionery by 23 percent, and soap by 16 percent. The variety of food has increased and the quality has improved. In 1950, 75 percent of butter production and 42 percent of cheese production were high-quality products. The output of nutritional foods increased fivefold compared to the pre-war period, baby food increased by 5.7 times, and vitamins increased by 10.4 times.
		In 1950, the total output of local industry and production cooperatives increased by 50 percent compared with the pre-war period. However, local raw materials have not been fully utilized to increase the production of consumer goods. The variety and quality of products produced by local industries and consumer cooperatives are still behind the increased national needs.
		Due to the restoration, construction and reconstruction of various enterprises and the assembly of the latest Soviet technology, the fixed production fund of the entire Soviet industry increased by 58 percent in 1950 compared with 1940. The total number of machine tools at the end of the Five-Year Plan was more than twice that of 1940, during which time a lot of new, more productive machine tools were added.
		The successful adoption of new technologies enabled the national economy to be further technically re-equipped on a large scale and to improve the level of mechanization of laborious and heavy work. At the same time, technological progress, the improvement of the skills of workers, engineers and technicians, and their creative labor ensured a substantial increase in labor productivity. The labor productivity of workers in industry in 1950 exceeded that of 1940 before the war by 37 percent, while the Five-Year Plan stipulated that it should exceed by 36 percent. The labor productivity in construction in 1950 exceeded the 1940 level by 23 percent.
		The provisions of the Five-Year Plan on reducing the production cost of industrial products in 1950 have been realized, by better utilizing industrial equipment, saving more raw materials, fuel and electricity, reducing the loss and waste of raw materials, improving labor productivity and accelerating the turnover of working capital.
		The goal of reducing construction costs in the Five-Year Plan has not been fully achieved. Although basic engineering has increased, construction costs are still high. In this regard, the government took measures in 1950 to reduce construction costs and improve design work, increase the production of building materials, and eliminate the shortcomings in planning and supply in basic construction.

	The completion of the Five-Year Plan in agriculture:
		Thanks to the successful completion of the Five-Year Plan, agriculture has made new and powerful progress. During the Five-Year Plan, the collective farms' public economy has developed and become stronger, agriculture's material and technical equipment has increased, the role of machine tractor stations in collective farm production has become greater, and new skilled agricultural production personnel, experts in cultivation, animal husbandry and mechanization, have been trained.
		The area of grain cultivation increased by more than 20 percent during the five years. The total grain harvest in 1950 increased by 345 million poods compared with 1940, and the wheat production increased by 376 million poods compared with the pre-war period. Grain production has exceeded the target of the Five-Year Plan. In 1949 and 1950, grain production increased by 13 percent compared with 1940.
		During the five years, the area of industrial crop cultivation increased by 59 percent, of which cotton increased by 91 percent, flax by 90 percent, sugar beet by 57 percent, and sunflower by 23 percent. Cotton production increased by 1.9 times in five years, flax fiber by more than one time, sugar beet by 1.7 times, and sunflower by 70 percent.
		Losses are still great in harvesting work, especially in the harvesting of grains, flax and sugar beet, which is a serious shortcoming in agricultural production.
		The area for planting vegetables, melons and potatoes increased by 5 percent compared with 1940. The total harvest of potatoes in 1950 exceeded the pre-war level by 21 percent. During the five years, much work has been done to further consolidate and expand potato and vegetable production facilities around the industrial centers of Moscow, Leningrad, Baku, Kharkov, Kiev, Gorky, the Urals, the Donets coal mining area and the Kuznetsk coal mining area, the cities of Siberia and the Far East, and other major cities.
		The area for planting feed crops in 1950 increased by 15 percent compared with 1940. However, the target of increasing the area for planting perennial pastures in the Five-Year Plan has not been fully achieved; feed production cannot keep up with the needs of animal husbandry.
		In animal husbandry, the task of increasing the collective farms' public livestock stipulated in the Five-Year Plan has been exceeded. The number of productive livestock and poultry in collective farms has greatly exceeded the pre-war period: edible cattle and dairy cows exceed by 40 percent, sheep and goats by 63 percent, pigs by 49 percent, and poultry increased by one time.
		The total number of productive livestock, which had been greatly reduced during the war, has been restored to the pre-war level after the war. In 1950, the livestock raised by collective farms, state farms, collective farmers and individual farmers, factory workers and staff in various economic sectors increased by 4 percent compared with 1940, and poultry increased by 14 percent.
		During the Five-Year Plan, collective farms and state farms have completed a lot of work in improving purebred livestock breeding; state purebred livestock farms, state purebred livestock centers, and purebred livestock departments of collective farms have been expanded.
		The technical equipment of agriculture has increased. During the Five-Year Plan, agriculture has acquired 536,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 93,000 grain combine harvesters, 39,000 self-propelled machines, 341,000 tractor-drawn plows, 254,000 tractor-drawn seeders, 249,000 tractor-drawn cultivators, and a large number of other various tillage, seeding and harvesting machines. However, the supply of machines for harvesting cotton, flax, hemp, and sugar beet to agriculture, the production of feed, and the mechanization of the laborious work in the animal husbandry departments of collective farms and state farms cannot keep up with the needs. Much work has been completed in the electrification of collective farms, machine tractor stations and state farms. At the end of 1950, the power generation of rural power plants increased by 1.8 times compared with 1940.
		Great achievements have been made in improving the efficiency of agricultural work: a lot of work has been done in implementing and mastering the pasture crop rotation system in collective farms and state farms; in 1950, tractors cultivated more than 90 percent of the fallow land and all autumn-plowed land of collective farms; 87 percent of the land cultivated by tractors was plowed with plows equipped with plowshares (only 13 percent in 1940); in 1950, 63 percent of the spring crop area of collective farms was sown on autumn-plowed land and cultivated fallow land (only 54 percent in 1940); during the five years, the sown area of selected grains increased by 64 percent, and wheat doubled; in 1950, half of the total grain planting area of collective farms was harvested by combine harvesters.
		The target of planting shelterbelts has been successfully achieved. Collective farms, state farms, machine tractor stations, forest farms and afforestation stations have planted shelterbelts in an area of 1.35 million hectares to realize Stalin's plan to transform nature, of which shelterbelts in an area of 760,000 hectares were planted in 1950.
		The goal of developing state farms in the Five-Year Plan has been achieved. State farms have greatly expanded the sown area in the five years.
		The harvest of grains in 1950 increased by 16 percent compared with 1940. The mechanization of farmland work has basically been completed in the state farms under the Soviet Union State Farms Department. In 1950, 95 percent of the work of cultivation, sowing and grain harvesting was completed by machines. By the end of 1950, the edible cattle and dairy cows of the state farms under the Soviet Union State Farms Department increased by 20 percent compared with the pre-war period, sheep and goats increased by 29 percent, and pigs increased by 36 percent. The productivity of livestock products has greatly increased. In 1950, the average milk production per cow in the state farms under the Soviet Union State Farms Department increased by 28 percent compared with the 1940 level.
		During the Five-Year Plan, much work has been done in further consolidating collective farms organizationally and economically and eliminating violations of the agricultural labor combination regulations; measures have been taken to improve the organization and adjustment of labor remuneration in collective farms, consolidate permanent production teams and make them the main organizational form of collective labor; labor discipline has been greatly strengthened, and labor productivity in collective farms has increased. By 1950, the public reserve fund of collective farms increased by 60 percent compared with 1940.
		The Soviet Union has provided great assistance to the farmers' economy in the Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian and Moldavian member republics, and to the farmers' economy in the western regions of the Ukrainian and Belarusian Republics, which had suffered disasters under German occupation, by strengthening agricultural cooperatives, organizing machine tractor stations, supplying tractors and machines and mineral fertilizers, and by providing loans. By the end of the Five-Year Plan, the work of collectivizing farm households in these areas on a voluntary basis has been basically completed.
		The development of socialist agriculture and its huge production volume for the supply market has ensured the supply of more bread, meat, butter and other agricultural products to the people, and has increased the income of collective farms and collective farmers. The greater production volume of grains and industrial crops and the increase in livestock products have provided a reliable source of raw materials for the further development of light industry and the food industry.

	The completion of the Five-Year Plan in transportation:
		During the Five-Year Plan, the railway met the increasing needs of the national economy in freight transportation. The railway freight transport target scheduled for 1950 has been exceeded by 13 percent. In 1950, the average daily railway freight volume was 121 percent of the 1940 level and 103 percent of the Five-Year Plan target.
		Due to the use of advanced labor methods and new technical equipment, the use of vehicles on the railway has been considerably improved. In 1950, the carrying capacity of each freight car increased by 14 percent compared with 1940, and the average carrying capacity of each freight train increased by 10 percent compared with 1940. The average daily mileage of freight cars exceeded the pre-war level by 4.6 percent. During the Five-Year Plan, the turnover of vehicles has been accelerated, but it has not reached the level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan in 1950.
		Due to the restoration of the national economy in the areas destroyed during the war, and due to the adoption of measures to eliminate unreasonable freight transport, the average freight transport distance in the past five years has been shortened compared with the past, but the goal of shortening the freight transport distance in 1950 as stipulated in the plan has not been fully achieved.
		Repairing the railways that were severely damaged during the war was the decisive task of the post-war Five-Year Plan. In the Five-Year Plan, the work of restoring double-track bridges, stations and transfer stations has ensured the necessary carrying capacity of the railway in the main direction. The locomotives have been greatly renovated, and new locomotives, diesel locomotives and electric locomotives have been added; the railcars have also been renovated and supplemented. New railways have been built, especially in northern Asia and Central Asia. In the suburbs of the railway centers of the Urals, Transcaucasia and Krivoy Rog, as well as Moscow, Leningrad, Riga, Kiev, Baku and Tallinn, many railways have been electrified, but the goals of restoring and constructing railways, bridges and stations as stipulated in the Five-Year Plan have not been fully achieved.
		The freight volume of inland river transport in 1950 increased by 26 percent compared with 1940, but it has not reached the level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. The work of using the Volga River and its tributaries, as well as the Siberian and northern rivers for transportation has been improved. In 1950, the carrying capacity of tugboats increased by 30 percent compared with 1940, and the carrying capacity of barges increased by 43 percent.
		Inland river vessels have been renovated and supplemented. The White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal named after Stalin and the waterway of the Dnepr River-Bug River, as well as river ports and ship repair industries have been restored.
		The freight volume of maritime shipping in 1950 increased by 65 percent compared with 1940, but it has not fully reached the level of maritime shipping freight volume stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. The work of restoring seaports and docks has been largely completed. In 1950, the number of docks and repair factories in the maritime shipping department was more than double that of 1940, and the number of shipbuilding equipment was 60 percent more. The freight volume of automobile transport in 1950 increased by 1.3 times compared with 1940. 16,000 kilometers of hard-surface highways have been built. The highway between Moscow and Simferopol has been put into use. By the end of the Five-Year Plan, the road network with paved roads was 1.5 times more than before the war.
		In the five years, communication tools and radio undertakings have been restored, and their further development on the basis of new technologies has been guaranteed. Telephone equipment has exceeded the pre-war level. The plan for constructing radio broadcasting stations in five years has exceeded 39 percent. The radio listening network has been expanded. The plan for restoring and laying wired telegraph lines has exceeded 23 percent during the five years. The airmail route has increased by 1.3 times compared with 1940.

	The completion of the Five-Year Plan in national income and state budget:
		The goal of increasing national income stipulated in the Five-Year Plan has been exceeded by many. The Five-Year Plan stipulates to exceed 38 percent of pre-war national income level. Calculated in comparable prices, the national income in 1950 actually exceeded 1940 by 64 percent. The increase in national income has greatly improved the material living conditions of workers, farmers and intellectuals, making it possible to invest large amounts of capital in the national economy, and accumulate the necessary national materials and food reserves.
		In capitalist countries, more than half of the national income is occupied by the bourgeoisie, while in the Soviet Union, all national income belongs to the working people. In 1950, the working people of the Soviet Union used 74 percent of the national income to meet their personal material and cultural needs. The remaining 26 percent was used by the state, collective farms and cooperatives to expand socialist production and for other state and social expenditures.
		The increase in national income has made the state budget have a surplus every year. In the state budget expenditure, the expenditure for national economy, social and cultural construction is constantly increasing.
		The increase in national income and the victorious execution of the state budget made national economic investment in the Five-Year Plan exceed 22 percent.
		From 1946 to 1950, more than 6,000 industrial enterprises have been restored, established and put into operation, not including the small enterprises operated by state-owned, cooperatives and collective farms.
		For the same reason, it was also possible to implement currency reform in December 1947, and to abolish the rationing system for all food and industrial products. During the period from 1947 to 1950, the prices of mass consumer goods were reduced to one-third of the original prices, which prepared the conditions for implementing another price reduction from March 1, 1951. This has ensured a substantial increase in the real wages of workers and staff, and intellectuals, allowing farmers to purchase industrial goods at reduced prices, thereby reducing expenditures, and further consolidating the ruble, increasing the ruble's purchasing power, and improving the ruble's exchange rate against foreign currencies.

	The completion of the Five-Year Plan in improving the people's material and cultural level:
		In the Soviet Union, there was no unemployment in the past, and there is no unemployment now. After the Great Patriotic War, all people who were demobilized from the Soviet Army and Navy were able to get full work according to their skills and occupations. The number of workers and other staff in the Soviet national economy reached 39.2 million at the end of 1950, an increase of 7.7 million compared with the end of 1940.
		The material conditions of the Soviet people have improved, which is manifested in the increase in the monetary wages and real wages of workers and staff, and the increase in the income obtained by farmers from the public collective farm economy and the subsidiary livestock and individual economy. The total income of workers and staff and the income of farmers in 1950, calculated in comparable prices, increased by 62 percent compared with 1940.
		The state's expenditure on the cultural and welfare undertakings of the working people has greatly increased. The state has allocated huge amounts of money to the people to run various welfare undertakings, including: welfare and cash under the social insurance system that workers and other staff can enjoy, social support pensions, free or low-cost access to sanatoriums, rest homes and childcare centers, subsidies for mothers with many children or single mothers, free medical care, free education or free improvement of skills for the working people, the cost is paid by the state, student scholarships, and many other welfare and rights. In addition, all workers and other staff can have at least two weeks of paid leave every year, and workers in certain occupations can also have longer leave. The total value of state subsidies and cash obtained by the people in 1950 was more than 120 billion rubles, which is twice as much as in 1940.
		Along with the improvement of the people's material life, Soviet culture, science and art have also been further developed in the post-war period. During these five years, the number of students in primary schools, seven-year schools and secondary schools, technical schools and other secondary education institutions has increased by 8 million, and the total number of students in these schools reached 37 million in 1950. In 1950, there were 1.298 million students in technical schools and secondary specialized education institutions, while in 1940 there were 975,000 students. In 1950, there were 1.247 million students in higher education institutions, while in 1940 there were 812,000 students.
		During these five years, the various sectors of the national economy have added 652,000 experts with higher education degrees, and 1.278 million experts with secondary education degrees. Compared with 1940, the number of experts working in various sectors of the national economy increased by 84 percent.

　　苏联战后五年计划胜利完成
　  苏联国家计划委员会与中央统计局关于一九四六至一九五零年苏联第四次五年计划执行结果的公报
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十七日电：苏联国家计划委员会与中央统计局发表关于一九四六——一九五○年苏联第四次（战后第一次）五年计划执行结果的公报如下：
    一九四六年三月经苏联最高苏维埃通过的一九四六——一九五○年恢复与发展苏联国民经济战后五年计划，已经胜利完成，而且计划的主要任务已经大大超过了。
  工业方面完成五年计划的情形：
    苏联工业的恢复与发展，在这一次五年计划期间取得了伟大的成就。这次五年计划原来规定：到一九五○年（五年计划的最后一年）苏联全部工业产量应较战前一九四○年增加百分之四十八。实际上，一九五○年的工业产量已较一九四○年增加了百分之七十三。苏联工业已经提前完成了五年计划——仅用了四年零三个月的时间。五年计划中所规定的一九五○年的工业生产目标已经超过百分之十七。
    保证社会主义各工业部门技术水平进一步发展的基础，就是采用现代化技术的最新成就。
    五年计划为钢铁工业所规定的关于钢及辗金属生产的任务已超额完成。五年计划所规定的一九五○年辗铁金属的生产水平已经提前在一九五○年第三季达到，而钢的生产水平在一九五○年的第二季即已达到。
    钢铁工业部已经完成了铣铁生产的五年计划。一九五○年黑色金属的全部生产已超过战前水平百分之四十五，而五年计划原定任务为超过百分之三十五；铣铁生产超过战前水平百分之二十九，钢的生产超过战前水平百分之四十九，辗金属超过战前水平百分之五十九。战时完全被毁的南部的钢铁工业，已在新的技术基础上恢复，产量高于战前。我国东部各区的钢铁工业正继续向前发展。一九五○年乌拉尔铣铁生产较一九四○年增加一点六倍，钢的生产增加一点七倍，辗金属生产增加一点八倍。西伯利亚的铣铁生产增加百分之二十，钢的生产增加百分之七十，辗金属生产增加一倍。在中央亚细亚与外高加索，也组织了黑色金属的生产。虽然钢和辗金属都已超额完成了计划，但是黑色金属尤其是某种辗金属的生产，都还赶不上国民经济的增大了的需要。
    钢铁工业中的生产技术已经改善。制钢方面已掌握了氧气的使用。制造新型机器和工具所用的特种形状的辗金属及各种钢的生产已经精通。费力与艰苦的工作的机械化及生产过程的自动化已大规模实行。装备的使用也大大改善了。例如，一九五○年年底，钢铁工业部所属各厂鼓风炉有效容量的使用比一九四○年提高了百分之二十五，西门马丁炉每一平方公尺炉底的钢产量增加了百分之三十三。
    在有色金属工业方面，铜、铝、镍、铅、锌和其他有色与稀有金属的生产，由于建立了新的矿山、选矿厂，由于企业经营的改进，已大大超过了战前水平。但是，国民经济日益增长的需要仍要求有色金属的生产更迅速地提高。
    煤炭生产的五年计划已经超额完成了。一九五○年的煤炭生产达到的目标为五年计划规定任务的百分之一○四，比战前水平增加了百分之五十七。煤业部所属矿山提前在一九四九年第四季达到了五年计划所规定的一九五○年煤炭生产水平。在战争中被破坏地区的煤矿场已经恢复。顿尼兹盆地的矿坑的煤产量超过了战前和五年计划规定的目标。顿尼兹盆地已再度成为全国最大的和最机械化的产煤区。莫斯科盆地的煤产量比战前水平增加了二倍多。
    与顿尼兹及莫斯科盆地的恢复同时，乌拉尔、库兹涅茨克、卡拉干达及国内其他地区的煤业也在继续发展着。一九五○年，苏联东部煤产量相当于战前一倍多。新的产煤中心（彼楚拉产煤区）已大大地扩大了。泥炭的生产超过了战前水平。掘煤、打煤与运煤，地下运输和把煤装入铁轨车辆的工作都已机械化。新式机器已经发明并且加以采用，这些机器使掘煤地方的装煤工作机械化了，并且使准备掘煤地方的装煤和装石工作机械化了。使矿坑广泛机械化的工作已经开始，机器和设备操作的远距离控制与自动指挥的方法正在加以采用。
    五年计划恢复和发展石油业的任务已经超额完成。一九五○年的石油产量为五年计划目标的百分之一○七，超过战前百分之二十二。战时被毁的迈科普与格罗兹尼区和乌克兰西部的石油业已经完全恢复，技术上已经重新装备过。由于地质勘查成功，已经发现大量的石油与煤气矿藏，并准备加以开采。新的汲油、凿井与炼油的技术正广泛采用着。高辛烷航空汽油与其他航空油类的生产已经扩大，石油产品的质量也已经改进。有现代化苏联设备的新的炼油厂已经建立，巨大的干线油管已经装设起来。同时，产油量的迅速增加需要更加速地建立新的炼油厂。
    新开发的东方产油区的重要性大为增加。在巴什基尔自治共和国，新开辟了巨大的油田并建立了炼油厂。在古比雪夫州，在土库曼、乌兹贝克和哈萨克等共和国，石油的生产和提炼工作有了飞速的发展。在鞑靼自治共和国，已发现了巨大的石油矿藏。东部地区石油产量在一九四○年仅占全苏联石油产量的百分之十二，目前已增至百分之四十四。
    煤气工业有更进一步的发展。萨拉多夫——莫斯科，达沙瓦——基辅，科特拉—雅威—列宁格勒等几条长途煤气管，已经架设完竣，并已开始使用。生产人造液体燃料的工厂的建设已经发展了。
    五年计划所规定的电力生产任务已经超额完成。五年计划所规定的一九五○年电力生产水平，已经提前在一九四九年第四季达到。一九五○年的电力生产达到五年计划原定目标的百分之一一○，超过一九四○年水平的百分之八十七。在战争中被破坏的地区，电力生产已大大超过一九四○年的水平。
    下列各地在战时被摧毁的动力厂已经恢复：顿尼兹盆地、第聂伯区、基辅、哈尔科夫、罗夫、敖德萨、庙街、悉瓦斯托波尔、诺佛罗西斯克、克拉斯诺达、格罗兹尼、斯大林格勒、佛罗内兹、布利安斯克、加里宁、明斯克、维尔那、里加、塔林、彼得罗萨佛得斯克及其他城市。
    所有的水力发电厂都恢复了，其中还包括五年计划中所规定的六个大水力发电厂。第聂伯城列宁水力发电厂已经恢复。许多新的水力发电厂——谢尔巴科夫厂、尼瓦一厂、尼瓦三厂以及法哈德、赫拉米、苏虎姆、克拉斯诺波利扬斯克、希罗科夫及其他水电厂，都已建立起来而且全部开工了。在维尔赫涅斯维尔、乌斯特卡敏诺哥尔斯克、基乌穆什、齐姆良斯卡雅、马特科日宁及其他水力发电厂都在进行大规模的建设工程，这些工程保证这些电力厂在一九五一年、一九五二年便可使用。伏尔加河上高尔基水力发电厂和卡马河上的莫洛托夫水力发电厂的建筑工程已经大规模展开。新的热力和电力厂、电力和热力输送网也已建设完成。
    在一九四六——一九五○年期间，各电力厂都采用了最新式的动力技术。各热力和电力厂中都装置了苏联制造的蒸汽透平的高压汽锅，其中包括新式的二万五千千瓦的高压蒸气透平，一百大气压力、蒸汽温度为五百一十度的圆筒锅炉，以及具有同样特性的单流锅炉。
    各电力厂也采用了氢气冷却发电机、高压空气开关、高频率及其他现代化保护设备；实现了燃烧过程及锅炉添煤工作的自动化等等。地方水力发电厂有三分之二已将装备操作自动化。
    在机器制造方面，五年计划所规定的工作母机、机械装备及工具的生产任务，整个说来已超过了百分之十七。一九五○年机器制造业生产为一九四○年的二点三倍。五年计划所规定的一九五○年机器装备与工具的生产水平，已提前在一九五○年第一季达到。
    机器及装备生产的增加，是以新的技术为基础的。在各机器制造工厂中，已普遍实行了具有高度效率的生产方法和技术过程，其中包括：直接生产和自动连续生产法、涂敷焊药后用自动及半自动机器进行焊接、用高频率电流将零件硬化、离心铸造、铁模铸造、压型及高速切割金属方法等。
    在五年计划期间，机器工业的各部门大体都已将产品项目表加以改订。在制作上已经熟练精通了的新式机器有万能金属切割母机约二百五十种、特种及复合母机一千余种、自动及半自动机器二十三种、锻冶及自动压型机器与强力风力铸造机和压力及离心力铸造机三十四种。二十六座自动母机连续生产装置以及生产汽车零件的自动化工厂业已建立。
    一九五○年冶金装备的生产比一九四○年增加了三点八倍，蒸汽透平生产增加了一点六倍，电气装备生产增加了二倍。采煤联合机、装石机、装煤机、深井凿井设备、强力吸泥唧筒及多种高效率的装备，已经制造出来供燃料工业使用。一九五○年采油装备的生产，为一九四○年的三倍。
    现在已经掌握并组织了新式干线运货机车、电气机车、柴油机车、卸货车、全金属敞车与恒温车和全金属客车的生产，以供应铁路的需要。
    和一九四○年比较，一九五○年拖拉机的产量增加了二点八倍、联合机二点六倍、拖拉机曳引犁二点一倍、拖拉机曳引条播机四点五倍、拖拉机曳引耕耘机二点一倍。一百五十多种高效率新式农业机器的制造已经精通，并已进行大规模生产。
    然而，已经达到的电气装备、重型金属切割机、锻冶与压型装备、炼油业所用的复杂的设备和某些种类的器械的产量水平，还不能适应国民经济的扩大了的需要。
    在化学工业方面，五年计划规定在一九五○年要超过战前水平的百分之五十。实际上，化学工业的产量超过了战前水平的百分之八十。一九五○年，含氮肥料的产量超出战前水平一点二倍，钾肥料产量超出百分之四十，高于五年计划所规定的数额。磷肥料超出百分之九十。人造橡胶的产量也比战前增加了。
    人造纤维工业，塑胶、油漆工业，制药工业及其他化学工业部门，产量均增加了很多，并且掌握了许多新产品的制造方法。五年计划所规定的染料产量已超额完成。一九五○年染料的牌子已增加到三百二十种，而一九四○年为一百八十六种。质量优良永不褪色的染料的产量已经增加。彩色照相胶片的制造技术已能完全掌握。
    建筑材料的生产超过了战前水平。与一九四○年相较，水泥的产量增加了百分之八十，窗玻璃增加了百分之九十。
    五年计划所规定的一九五○年水泥生产任务，在苏联建筑材料工业部方面完成了百分之一○一。就全苏联来说完成了百分之九十七。五年计划所规定的砖瓦产量目标没有完全达到。建筑材料的生产和产品的质量，仍远落后于国民经济日益增长的需要。
    在木材工业方面，一九五○年所采集的木材比一九四○年增加了百分之三十六，但是，五年计划所规定的任务并没有完成。五年计划所规定对木材业供应机器和设备一项任务是超额完成了，但是由于未能很好地利用这些设备，木材业在五年计划期间劳动生产率增加的速度是不够的。
    一九五○年纸的生产比一九四○年增加了百分之四十七。
    在一九四六—一九五○年期间，纺织、衣服、编织品、鞋类和其他轻工业部门的恢复和发展进行的速度很快。一九五○年这些轻工业部门的产量比一九四○年增加了百分之十七。
    轻工业主要物品的生产在五年计划期间增加的情形如下：棉织品一点四倍、毛织物一点九倍、袜子四点二倍、皮鞋二点二倍、胶鞋六倍。但是，五年计划所规定的棉织品和鞋类生产的任务并未完成。织物、衣服、编织品和靴鞋的质量已大大地改良，种类也大大增加了。
    食品工业主要产品的产量在五年中大大提高了。一九五○年奶油生产超过战前水平的百分之五十七、植物油和其他脂肪超过百分之十、鲜肉百分之七、捕鱼量百分之二十七、各种腊肠百分之二十、罐头食品百分之四十八、糖百分之十七、糖果百分之二十三、肥皂百分之十六。食品的种类增加了，质量也改善了。一九五○年奶油产量的百分之七十五和干酪产量的百分之四十二是优等产品。营养食品的产量增加为战前的五倍，婴孩食品增加为五点七倍，维他命增加为十点四倍。
    一九五○年地方工业和生产合作社的总产量比战前增加百分之五十。但是，地方原料还没有被充分利用来增加消费品的生产。地方工业和消费合作社的生产品的种类和质量还落在增加了的国民需要的后面。
    由于恢复、建设与重建了各种企业并装配以最新式的苏联技术，整个苏联工业的固定生产基金在一九五○年较一九四○年增加了百分之五十八。工作母机的总数在五年计划行将结束时等于一九四○年的两倍以上，在这期间，补充了不少新的生产力更高的工作母机。
    胜利地采用新技术使国民经济得以进一步大规模地重新作技术上的装备，并提高消耗劳力的笨重工作机械化的水平。同时，技术上的进步，工人、工程师与技师的熟练程度的提高以及他们的创造性劳动，保证了劳动生产率的大量提高。工业中工人的劳动生产率一九五○年超过战前一九四○年百分之三十七，而五年计划规定超过百分之三十六。一九五○年在建筑方面的劳动生产率超过一九四○年水平百分之二十三。
    五年计划中关于一九五○年减低工业品生产成本的规定已经实现了，采取的办法是更好地利用工业装备，更加节约原料、燃料和电力，减少原料的损失和浪费，提高劳动生产率和加速流动资金的周转。
    五年计划中关于减少建筑成本的目标还没有完全达到。虽然基本工程有了增加，建筑成本仍然很高。在这方面，政府于一九五○年采取了措施来降低建筑成本和改善设计工作，增加建筑材料的生产并消灭基本建筑中计划和供应方面的缺点。
  农业方面完成五年计划的情形：
    由于五年计划的胜利完成，农业获得了新的强有力的进展。在五年计划期间，集体农场的公有经济有了发展并且更加强大了，农业的物资和技术设备增加了，机器拖拉机站在集体农场的生产上的作用更大了，农业生产的熟练的新组织人员，耕作、牲畜饲养和机械化工作的专家已经训练出来了。
    谷物种植的面积在五年期间增加了百分之二十以上。谷物总收获量一九五○年比一九四○年增加了三亿四千五百万普特，小麦的产量比战前增加了三亿七千六百万普特。谷物产量已经超过五年计划的目标。在一九四九年和一九五○年，谷物的产量均比一九四○年增加了百分之十三。
    在五年期间，工业作物的种植面积增加了百分之五十九，其中棉花增加百分之九十一、亚麻百分之九十、甜菜百分之五十七、向日葵百分之二十三。棉花产量在五年间增加了一点九倍、亚麻纤维一倍以上、甜菜一点七倍、向日葵百分之七十。
    在收获工作中，特别是在谷物、亚麻和甜菜的收获方面，损失仍然很大，这是农业生产中的严重缺点。
    种植蔬菜、瓜和马铃薯的面积比一九四○年增加了百分之五。一九五○年的马铃薯总收获量超过战前水平百分之二十一。五年中曾经在莫斯科、列宁格勒、巴库、哈尔科夫、基辅、高尔基、乌拉尔、顿尼兹矿区和库兹涅茨克矿区的工业中心、西伯利亚和远东的各城市以及其他各大城市的周围，进行了许多进一步巩固和扩大马铃薯与蔬菜生产设备的工作。
    一九五○年的饲料作物种植面积比一九四○年增加了百分之十五。但是五年计划中增加多年生牧草的种植面积的目标并没有完全达到；饲料生产赶不上牲畜饲养业的需要。
    在牲畜饲养方面，五年计划中规定增加集体农场公有家畜的任务已经超额完成。集体农场中有出产的牲畜与家禽的数目已大大超过战前：食用牛和乳牛超过百分之四十、绵羊和山羊百分之六十三、猪百分之四十九、家禽增加一倍。
    在战时曾大大减少了的有出产的牲畜总头数，在战后已经恢复到战前水平。在一九五○年的各经济部门中，集体农场、国家农场、集体农民和个体农民、工厂工人和职员所饲养的牲畜较一九四○年增加了百分之四，家禽增加了百分之十四。
    在五年计划期间，集体农场和国家农场在改进纯种牲畜饲养方面完成了许多工作；国家纯种牲畜饲养场、国家纯种牲畜中心站、集体农场的纯种牲畜部都已扩充了。
    农业的技术设备已经增加。在五年计划期间，农业方面获得了五十三万六千部拖拉机（每部以十五匹马力计算）、九万三千部谷物联合机、三万九千部自动推进机、三十四万一千个拖拉机牵引犁、二十五万四千部拖拉机牵引条播机、二十四万九千部拖拉机牵引耕耘机，以及大量的其他各种耕田、播种和收割的机器。但是，在供应农业以收割棉花、亚麻、大麻、甜菜的机器方面，在饲料的生产方面，在使集体农场和国家农场牲畜饲养部门的消耗劳力的工作机械化方面却赶不上需要。在集体农场、机器拖拉机站及国家农场电气化方面完成了许多的工作。在一九五○年年底，农村电力厂的发电量较一九四○年增加了一点八倍。
    在提高农业工作的效率方面获得了巨大的成就：在集体农场和国家农场中实行和掌握牧草作物轮种制方面，已作了很多工作；在一九五○年拖拉机耕耘了集体农场的百分之九十以上的休耕地和全部秋耕地；在拖拉机所耕的土地中有百分之八十七是用装有犁刀的犁耕的（在一九四○年只有百分之十三）；在一九五○年，集体农场的春季作物面积有百分之六十三是在秋耕地和耕过的休耕地上播种的（在一九四○年只有百分之五十四）；在五年中，选种谷物的播种面积增加了百分之六十四，小麦增加一倍；在一九五○年集体农场的全部谷物种植面积有一半是以联合机收割的。
    防护林带植造的目标已胜利地达到了。集体农场、国家农场、机器拖拉机站、林场和造林站为了实现斯大林改造自然的计划，在一百三十五万公顷的地区植造了防护林带，其中七十六万公顷地区的防护林带是在一九五○年植造的。
    五年计划中发展国家农场的目标已经达到。五年中国家农场大为扩大了播种面积。
    一九五○年谷物的收获量较一九四○年增加百分之十六。农田工作的机械化基本上已在苏联国家农场部所属国家农场中完成了。在一九五○年，耕地、播种和谷物收割工作的百分之九十五是用机械来完成的。到一九五○年年底，苏联国家农场部所属国家农场的食用牛和乳牛较战前增加了百分之二十，绵羊和山羊增加百分之二十九、猪增加百分之三十六。牲畜的产物生产率有很大增加。在一九五○年，苏联国家农场部所属国家农场平均一头牛所产的牛奶较一九四○年水平增加百分之二十八。
    在五年计划期间，在组织上与经济上进一步巩固集体农场和消灭违犯农业劳动组合章程的现象方面，做了很多的工作；已采取措施来改善组织与调整集体农场中的劳动报酬，巩固永久性的生产队，使其成为集体劳动的主要组织形式；劳动纪律大大加强了，集体农场中的劳动生产率提高了。到一九五○年，集体农场的公积金与一九四○年相较增加了百分之六十。
    苏联以加强农业合作社、组织机器拖拉机站、供应拖拉机及机器和矿物肥料的方法并以贷款的方法，对立陶宛、拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚和摩尔达维亚等加盟共和国的农民经济，和曾在德国占领下遭受过灾害的乌克兰和白俄罗斯共和国西部地区的农民经济给予巨大的帮助。到五年计划结束时，这些地区的农户在自愿基础上集体化的工作已在基本上完成了。
    社会主义农业的发展及其供应市场的巨大生产量，保证了供应人民以更多的面包、肉类、奶油及其他农产品，并使集体农场和集体农民的收入得以增加。谷物和工业作物的更大的生产量及牲畜出产物的增加，为轻工业和食品工业的进一步发展提供了可靠的原料供应来源。
  交通运输方面完成五年计划的情形：
    在五年计划期间，铁路满足了国民经济在货运方面日益增加的需要。预定的一九五○年的铁路货运的目标，已被超过了百分之十三。一九五○年平均每日铁路载运量为一九四○年水平的百分之一二一，为五年计划规定目标的百分之一○三。
    由于使用先进的劳动方法和新的技术设备，铁路上车辆的使用已有相当大的改进。在一九五○年，每辆货车的载运量比一九四○年增加了百分之十四，平均每列运货火车的载运量比一九四○年增加了百分之十。货车平均每日行程超过战前水平百分之四点六。在五年计划期间，车辆的运转已经加速，但在一九五○年还没有达到五年计划所规定的水平。
    由于战争中被破坏地区国民经济的恢复，由于采用了消除不合理的货运的措施，过去五年的平均货运路程已较前缩短，但是还未完全达到计划所规定的在一九五○年中缩短货运路程的目标。
    修复战争中受重大破坏的铁路是战后五年计划的决定性的任务。在五年计划中恢复双轨桥梁、车站和转车车站的工作保证了铁路在主要方向的必要载运量。机车已大大地翻新，并且补充了新式机车、柴油机车和电气机车；车皮也同样翻新和得到了补充。建筑了新的铁路，特别是在亚洲北部中亚细亚。在乌拉尔、外高加索和克里沃伊罗格以及莫斯科、列宁格勒、里加、基辅、巴库和塔林等铁路中心的郊区，许多铁路已经电气化，但还未完全达到五年计划所规定的恢复和建筑铁路、桥梁和车站的目标。
    一九五○年的内河运货量比一九四○年增加百分之二十六，但还未达到五年计划所规定的水平。利用伏尔加河及其支流以及西伯利亚和北部河流作运输之用的工作已经改进。在一九五○年中，拖船的载运量比一九四○年增加了百分之三十，驳船的载运量增加了百分之四十三。
    内河船只已加翻新和得到了补充。以斯大林为名的白海——波罗的海运河和第聂伯河——布格河的航路以及河港和修船工业已告恢复。
    一九五○年的海上航运运货量比一九四○年增加了百分之六十五，但还未完全达到五年计划所规定的海上航运运货量的水平。恢复海港和船坞的工作大体上已经完成。在一九五○年，海上航运部的船坞和修理厂的数量比一九四○年多一倍以上，造船设备的数量多百分之六十。一九五○年的汽车运货量比一九四○年增加了一点三倍。已经造好一万六千公里的硬面公路。莫斯科和森佛罗波尔之间的公路已加以使用。到五年计划终了时，路面修好的公路网比战前增加了一点五倍。
    在五年中，通讯工具和无线电事业已告恢复，它们在新技术的基础上作进一步发展已得到保证。电话设备超过了战前水平。五年间建筑无线电广播台的计划超过了百分之三十九。无线电收听网扩大了。恢复与敷设有线电报线的计划在五年期间超过了百分之二十三。航空邮政路线比一九四○年增加了一点三倍。
  国民收入与国家预算方面完成五年计划的情形：
    五年计划所规定的增加国民收入的目标已超过了许多。五年计划规定要超过战前国民收入水平的百分之三十八。以比较价格计算，一九五○年的国民收入实际上超过了一九四○年百分之六十四。国民收入的增加使工人、农民和知识分子的物质生活状况得以大为改善，使得有可能以大笔资本投入国民经济，并积累必要的国家物资和存粮。
    在资本主义国家中，国民收入的一半以上为资产阶级所占有，而在苏联，全部国民收入都属于劳动人民。苏联的劳动人民一九五○年以国民收入的百分之七十四来满足他们个人的物质与文化需要。余下的百分之二十六由国家、集体农场与合作社用来扩大社会主义生产以及作国家与社会的其他开支。
    国民收入的增加使国家预算每年都有盈余。在国家预算支出中，用于国民经济、社会与文化建设的费用不断增加。
    国民收入的增加与国家预算的胜利执行使国民经济投资五年计划超过了百分之二十二。
    在一九四六——一九五○年，有六千个以上的工业企业已经恢复、建立和开工，国营的、合作社经营的以及集体农场经营的小型企业还未计算在内。
    由于同样的原因也使得一九四七年十二月能够实行币制改革，以及取消一切粮食与工业品的配给制度。在一九四七——一九五○年期间，大众消费品的价格降低到原价格的三分之一，这就准备了自一九五一年三月一日起实行另一次减低物价的条件。这就保证了工人和职员以及知识分子的实际工资大大增加，使得农民能以减低的价格购买工业品，因而减少了开支，并更加巩固了卢布，提高了卢布的购买力，改进了卢布对外国货币的兑换率。
  在提高人民物质与文化水平方面完成五年计划的情形：
    在苏联，过去没有失业，现在也没有失业。在伟大的卫国战争以后，从苏联陆军与海军中复员的一切人民，都能依照他们的技术与职业得到充分的工作。苏联国民经济中的工人与其他职员人数到一九五○年底已达三千九百二十万人，较一九四○年底增加了七百七十万人。
    苏联人民的物质境况改善了，这表现为工人和职员的货币工资和实际工资的增加，和农民自公有的集体农庄经济和附属的家畜及个人经济所获得的收入的增加。一九五○年工人职员的收入和农民的收入总额，如以比较价格计算，比一九四○年增加了百分之六十二。
    国家在劳动人民的文化和福利事业方面的开支有很大的增加。国家拨出巨款给人民兴办种种福利事业，其中包括：工人和其他职员均可享受的社会保险制度下的福利和现金，社会赡养年金，免费或低费进入疗养院、休养所和儿童保育院，子女众多的母亲或单身母亲的补助，免费医疗，劳动人民免费受教育或免费提高技术，所需费用由国家支付，学生公费，以及许多其他福利和权利。此外，全体工人和其他职员每年可有至少两星期的工资照付的假期，某些职业的工人还可以有较长的假期。人民在一九五○年所获得的国家补助和现金，其总值在一千二百亿卢布以上，亦即比一九四○年多二倍。
    与人民物质生活的改善同时，苏联文化、科学和艺术在战后时期也有了进一步的发展。在这五年当中，小学、七年制学校和中学、技术学校及其他中等教育机构的学生增加了八百万人，一九五○年这些学校的学生总人数达到三千七百万。技术学校和中等专门教育机构一九五○年共有学生一百二十九万八千人，而一九四○年为九十七万五千人。一九五○年，高等教育机构共有学生一百二十四万七千人，而一九四○年为八十一万二千人。
    在这五年当中，国民经济各部门增加了具有高等教育程度的专家六十五万二千人，具有中等教育程度的专家一百二十七万八千人。和一九四○年相较，在国民经济各部门中工作的专家增加了百分之八十四。
    过去五年中，我国在各种科学和技术方面均有重大的发现和发明。在五年计划期间，共有六千五百余人因在科学、技术、文学和艺术等方面有杰出的成绩、发明和成就而荣获斯大林奖金。遍布全国各地的科学研究所的数目，一九五○年为战前的一点五倍，而在其中工作的科学工作者的人数则几乎增加了一倍。
    全国文化和教育机构均已恢复，并已超过战前的规模。一九五○年，市镇和农村的俱乐部和公共图书馆数目较一九四○年增加了百分之十五。全国书籍的出版较一九四○年增加了百分之八十四。到一九五○年底，电影设备较一九四○年增加了百分之五十。

    苏联贸易的发展方面有了重要的成就。国家与合作社的零售贸易额大大地超过了战前一九四○年的水平。一九五○年国营商店与合作社的售货量（来自地方的货物销售不算在内），与一九四○年相比增加如下：肉与肉类产品百分之三十八、鱼产品百分之五十一、奶油百分之五十九、菜子油与其他脂肪百分之六十七、食糖百分之三十三、糖果百分之三十四、鞋类百分之三十九、棉织品毛织品丝织品麻织品百分之四十七、袜类百分之三十九。文化用品与家用器具在人民中间的销售量也增加了。一九五○年钟表销售量比战前一九四○年增加了二点三倍、无线电收音机五倍、家用电气用具百分之五十、脚踏车一点九倍、缝纫机几达二倍、机器脚踏车十五倍。建筑材料在农村的销售量增加了数倍。
    一九五○年集体农场的贸易量大大超过了一九四○年的水平。自从取消配给制与实行货币改革以来，集体农场的市场价格下降了。
    在战后五年计划期间，房屋建筑有了大规模的开展。国营企业、机关、各地方苏维埃、以及市镇与工人区的居民在国家贷款的帮助下建筑和修复的房屋，其地板面积总计在一亿平方公尺以上。此外，在农村的居民区，建筑和修复了二百七十万幢住屋。
