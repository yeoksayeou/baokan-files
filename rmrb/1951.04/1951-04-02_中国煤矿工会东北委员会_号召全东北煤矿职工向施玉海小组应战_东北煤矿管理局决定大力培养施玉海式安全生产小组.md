　　The Northeast Committee of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union is calling on all coal mine workers in Northeast China to actively accept the challenge from the Shi Yuhai safe production team and to widely launch the Shi Yuhai safe production movement.

　　In its instructions to the mine area committees, the Northeast Committee of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union pointed out that the understanding and gains of the local trade unions in Northeast China on coal mine safety production work are extremely inconsistent, and the thorough implementation of safety production to the team level is only just beginning. Therefore, trade unions at all levels must earnestly publicize and discuss the achievements and experiences of Shi Yuhai's safe production widely among underground workers and teams, and formulate specific conditions for safe production for teams or workfaces to challenge the Shi Yuhai team. The content of the conditions can be based on the specific situation of the team and workface, focusing on urgent problems to be solved, and propose appropriate conditions to prevent being too high, too low, or generalized. Mechanical and electrical factories should also mobilize and organize workers to propose safety conditions and learn from the Ma Hengchang team. On the other hand, each mining area should plan and focus on cultivating typical figures and teams, workfaces, and pit entrances for safe production in their own mining area, gain experience, and guide the safe production work of the entire mining area.

　　In addition, the Northeast Coal Mine Administration convened a joint meeting of the heads of security from the seven major state-owned coal mines under its jurisdiction on March 23. In accordance with the spirit that safe production is one of the greatest tasks of Northeast China's coal mines in 1951, the meeting resolved to vigorously cultivate Shi Yuhai-style safe production teams. It also established award standards: starting from the date of no accidents, a team in a mine pit without accidents for one year will be recognized as a Shi Yuhai-style safe production team; a team in a mining bureau without accidents for two years will be recognized as a Shi Yuhai-style safe production team; and a team without accidents for three years will be recognized as a Shi Yuhai-style safe production team for the entire Northeast. Rewards and commendations will be given upon reaching the stipulated safe time. Efforts will be made to ensure that by the end of 1951, 2% to 5% of production teams become Shi Yuhai-style safe production teams for the entire Northeast, 10% to 15% become Shi Yuhai-style safe production teams for the mining bureau, and 20% to 30% become Shi Yuhai-style safe production teams for the mine pit.

　　The meeting finally called on all coal mine workers in Northeast China to humbly learn from the experience of the Shi Yuhai team, and all production management cadres to vigorously support this movement, and work together to create hundreds of Shi Yuhai-style safe production teams and lay the foundation for safe production.

　　中国煤矿工会东北委员会        
    号召全东北煤矿职工向施玉海小组应战        
    东北煤矿管理局决定大力培养施玉海式安全生产小组
    中国煤矿工会东北委员会号召全东北煤矿职工积极向施玉海安全生产小组应战，广泛开展施玉海安全生产运动。
    中国煤矿工会东北委员会为此向各矿区委员会发出的指示中指出：东北各地工会对煤矿安全生产工作的认识与收获是极不一致的，安全生产认真贯彻至小组还只是开始。因此，各级工会须认真地将施玉海安全生产的成就和经验，在井下工人和小组中广泛进行宣传讨论，订出小组或掌子安全生产具体条件，向施玉海小组应战。条件内容可根据本组和本掌子的具体情况，针对着急待解决的问题，提出恰当条件，防止过高、过低或一般化。机电工厂亦应动员组织工人提出安全条件，向马恒昌小组应战看齐。另一方面，各矿区要有计划有重点地培养本矿区安全生产典型人物和小组、掌子、井口，取得经验，指导全矿区安全生产工作。
    又，东北煤矿管理局于三月二十三日召开了所属七大国营煤矿保安负责人联席会议。会议根据安全生产是东北煤矿一九五一年最大任务之一的精神，决议大力培养施玉海式安全生产小组。并确定了奖励标准：由未发生事故日期算起，一年无事故者为矿坑的施玉海式安全生产小组，二年无事故者为矿务局的施玉海式安全生产小组，三年无事故的则为全东北的施玉海式安全生产小组。达到规定安全时间，即给予奖励和表扬。争取到一九五一年底要有百分之二到百分之五的生产小组成为全东北的施玉海式安全生产小组，百分之十到十五成为矿务局的施玉海式安全生产小组，百分之二十到三十成为矿坑的施玉海式安全生产小组。
    会议最后号召全东北煤矿工人要虚心学习施玉海小组的经验，全体生产管理干部则要大力支持这一运动，共同为创造数百个施玉海式安全生产小组，为安全生产打下基础而奋斗。
