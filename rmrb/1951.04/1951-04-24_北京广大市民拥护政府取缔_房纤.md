To the Editor:

The Beijing Municipal People's Government's announcement banning "house brokers" was immediately met with enthusiastic support from the broad masses of the people.

When newspaper delivery boys excitedly shouted the news of the ban on "brokers" at the Donghuamen bus station on the morning of the 14th, more than a dozen citizens in the waiting room rushed to buy newspapers to see. Huang Shaorong, a resident of No. 3 Madahu Tong, said after reading the newspaper: "House brokers demand 'brokerage fees' of three percent for a successful deal and two percent for a failed one. They also forcibly raise or lower prices, making it difficult for people to sell or buy houses easily. Now the People's Government, based on the demands of the masses, has banned 'brokers,' and everyone is truly happy." Yang Chunhua, a resident of No. 27 Cu Zhang Hutong, said: "The 'brokers' in Beijing are too hateful. They deceive buyers and sellers to profit from them. As long as they get the money, they don't care about any disputes afterwards. Now the government's strict ban on 'brokers' is really great." Many citizens revealed that many "brokers" were former evil puppet Baojia chiefs and special agents who have not reformed after liberation and are still engaged in brokering houses. They said: "The government should have banned this group of 'brokers' long ago." Li Tianxi, a citizen of the Second District, specially wrote a letter to the Real Estate Exchange, expressing his firm support for the government's measure to ban house brokers. He accused the "brokers" of their crimes, and finally asked the government to punish those "brokers" who committed serious crimes.

The working people are the happiest to hear the news of the ban on brokers. In the past, because they could not afford brokerage fees, brokers would not introduce them to houses, and it was very difficult to find a house on their own. Now they can contact landlords directly without going through brokers, or ask the Real Estate Exchange to introduce them. They firmly support this measure of the government. A rickshaw puller on Chongwai Street said: "Brokers should have been banned long ago. These people are all loafers who do nothing decent and only do bad things. The government's ban on brokers is another good thing for the people."

Many citizens who have been extorted and harassed by "brokers" in the past when buying and selling houses have come forward to accuse the "brokers" of their crimes and support the ban on brokering activities. Old Mrs. Zhang of No. 12, Dongsi Liutiao, said: "In the past, when I wanted to sell a house, the 'brokers' would find out and come to my house all day long to make trouble, insisting that it could only be sold through them. Now I can sell it at will, and they dare not stop me or extort 'brokerage fees' anymore." Manager Zhang of Longxiang Cloth Shop in the Seventh District said: "Once I wanted to sell a house, and I was immediately surrounded by 'brokers.' At first, several 'brokers' talked to me, and the prices they offered were lower than the last. Finally, a well-dressed man offered a higher price and bought the house. I thought he was the buyer, but later I found out that he was also a 'broker.' They collude with each other to defraud homeowners in this way."

Some working people, who had gone astray and become house brokers in the past because they had no other way to make a living, immediately stopped "brokering" activities after seeing the announcement and prepared to change careers. In the past, they worked hard running errands, but almost all of the "brokerage fees" they earned were exploited by the big "brokers." Sometimes, in order to compete with the big "brokers" for "brokerage fees," they were beaten until their heads were bleeding. They said: "The announcement is very right. Most of us are indeed local bullies and hooligans. We run errands for them and don't get much benefit, but instead get ourselves dirty. In the future, we will definitely abide by government laws and do honest work."

### 北京广大市民拥护政府取缔“房纤”

    北京广大市民拥护政府取缔“房纤”编辑同志：
    北京市人民政府取缔房屋“纤手”的布告在报纸上公布后，马上获得广大人民的热烈拥护。
    当十四日清晨卖报的孩子们在东华门公共汽车站兴奋地喊出取缔“纤手”的新闻时，候车室的十几位市民一拥而起抢着买报瞧。麻刀胡同三号住户黄少荣看完报纸后说：“拉房纤的要成三破二的‘纤费’，还硬抬或硬压价钱，让人轻易卖不出房子或买不进房子。现在人民政府根据群众要求，取缔了‘纤手’，大家真高兴。”醋章胡同二十七号住户杨春华说：“北京的‘纤手’太可恶。他们瞒哄买主卖主从中取利，只要钱到手，至于事后有没有纠纷，他可完全不管。现在政府严厉取缔‘纤手’真太好啦。”不少市民揭发很多“纤手”过去都是作恶多端的伪保甲长和特务分子，解放后仍不改正，又干拉房纤的活动。他们说：“政府早就该取缔这班‘纤手’了。”二区市民李天锡特地写了一封信给房地产交易所，表示坚决拥护政府取缔房纤的措施。他控诉了“纤手”的罪恶，最后并要求政府对“纤手”中罪恶严重的加以惩办。
    劳动市民听到取缔纤手的消息后最为欢喜。他们过去因为出不起纤费，纤手就不给他们介绍房子，自己找房很困难。现在他们可以不经过纤手，直接与房东接洽，或者请房地产交易所介绍了。他们坚决拥护政府这一措施。崇外大街一个排子车工人说：“拉纤的早就该取缔，这些人全是提笼架鸟的人，什么正经活也不干，就会作坏事。政府取缔纤手，又替人民办了一件好事。”
    许多过去买卖房屋受了“纤手”勒索和烦扰的市民，纷纷控诉“纤手”罪恶，拥护取缔房纤活动。东四六条十二号张老太太说：“过去我要卖房子，让‘纤手’知道了，一天到晚川流不息地来我家里寻麻烦，非经他们的手卖去不成。现在我才算可以随意出卖了，他们再也不敢拦阻我和勒索‘纤费’了。”七区隆祥布庄张经理说：“有一次我要卖房子，马上就有‘纤手’包围我。开始几个‘纤手’和我谈，说的价钱一个比一个低。最后有一个穿戴阔绰的人，出价高一些把房子买了去。我以为他是买主，后来才知道他也是‘纤手’。他们就是这样互相勾结来欺诈房主的。”
    有些劳动人民，因过去生活没办法走错了道做房纤的，看到布告后立即停止了“拉纤”活动，准备转业。他们过去辛辛苦苦跑腿，所得“纤费”几乎全被大“纤手”剥削了去，有时为了和大“纤手”争“纤费”，以致被打得头破血流。他们说：“布告说得很对。我们这一伙中，大部分确实尽是些地痞流氓分子。我们为他们跑腿，得不到多少好处，反而染了一身泥。今后一定遵守政府法令，作正经活去。”
