Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 15th – The World Federation of Scientific Workers, uniting over 35,000 scientists from various countries, held its second congress in Paris starting on the 10th. Due to the French government's refusal to issue entry visas, delegations from China, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and other countries held meetings simultaneously in Prague starting on the 11th. The Paris congress dispatched two special representatives to participate and maintain contact.

　　Joliot-Curie, the chairman of the Paris Congress and renowned scientist, stated in his opening speech: Scientists' obligations in social life have become increasingly heavy. The fruits of scientific research must benefit humanity. The cost of one month of world war would be enough to fully irrigate the Sahara Desert. If humanity puts all its efforts into seeking human welfare, they will create conditions that make war impossible. The power represented by scientists should be valued. Unity in the scientific community can also be achieved under conditions of peaceful coexistence of different political systems. Scientists must exchange various ideas and scientific research findings with each other. Through our collective wise and upright voices, it is possible to ease global tensions.

　　The congress elected its leadership on the 12th. Joliot-Curie was elected as Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Association, and Professor Li Siguang of China, Professor Bernal of the United Kingdom, and Professor Powell were elected as Vice-Chairmen. The congress has passed a resolution to establish headquarters in London, Prague, and Beijing.

　　The meeting held in Prague concluded on the 13th. The meeting passed a resolution stating: The Charter of Scientific Workers adopted by the First Congress of the World Federation of Scientific Workers defined significant tasks for scientific workers. Scientists should fight against the use of science to prepare for another world war. In view of the current increase in the threat of war, the delegates called on scientific workers around the world to jointly defend peace, strive to realize guaranteeing scientists' freedom of thought, enabling science to engage in peaceful construction, and opposing the preparation of atomic and bacteriological warfare. Representatives from various countries also called for the prompt convening of a conference with the participation of representatives of scientific workers from all over the world, so that scientists can unite in the struggle for human happiness. The time and place for the convening of the World Scientific Workers Congress will be decided by the Executive Committee of the Association.

　　The representatives of various countries attending the Prague meeting held a press conference on the 13th. Representatives of various countries unanimously stated that the French refusal to issue entry visas did not hinder the holding of the congress. The meetings held simultaneously in the two locations maintained close contact. The agenda of the meeting has been expanded, and discussions were held on plans to expand the circulation of the World Federation of Scientific Workers' publication "Science and Humanity," as well as the establishment of scientist convalescent centers in various countries and the enhancement of cultural relations among scientific workers.

　　世界科协举行第二届代表大会
　  决议号召世界科学工作者共同保卫和平
　  居里李四光等当选执委会正副主席
    【新华社布拉格十五日电】团结了各国科学家三万五千余人的世界科学工作者协会，于十日起在巴黎举行第二届代表大会。中国、德意志民主共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚等国代表团，由于法国政府拒发入境签证，他们于十一日起在布拉格同时举行了会议，巴黎大会特派代表二人参加，负责联系。
    巴黎大会的主持人、著名科学家约里奥——居里在致开幕词时称：科学家在社会生活中的义务已日益加重了，科学研究的成果必须为人类造福。世界大战一个月的费用，即足以充分灌溉撒哈拉沙漠，如果人类以全力谋求人类福利，他们就会造成一种使战争不可能爆发的条件。科学家所代表的力量是应受重视的。科学界的团结也是能够在不同政治制度和平共存的条件下实现的。科学家必须彼此交换各种观念及科学研究所得。通过我们共同的明智而正直的声音，便有可能解除全世界的紧张局势。
    大会于十二日选出领导机构。约里奥——居里当选为协会执行委员会主席，中国李四光教授、英国贝尔纳教授、鲍威尔教授当选为副主席。大会已通过决议，分别在伦敦、布拉格、北京三地设立总部。
    在布拉格举行的会议已于十三日结束。会议通过决议称：世界科学工作者协会第一届代表大会通过的科学工作者的宪章，为科学工作者确定了重大的任务，科学家应当为反对利用科学准备另一次世界战争而斗争。鉴于目前战争威胁的增长，与会代表号召世界科学工作者共同保卫和平，力求实现保证科学家的思想自由、使科学从事和平建设，以及反对准备原子战争和细菌战争。各国代表并号召从速召开有全世界科学工作者代表参加的大会，使科学家在为人类幸福的斗争中团结起来。会议并发表了告世界科学工作者书，呼吁支持上述要求。世界科学工作者代表大会的召开时间及地点将由协会执行委员会决定。
    出席布拉格会议的各国代表十三日举行招待记者会。各国代表一致表示：法国拒发入境签证并未能阻挠大会的举行。在两地同时举行的会议保持着密切的联系。会议的议程已加扩大，讨论了扩大发行世界科学工作者协会刊物“科学与人类”的计划，以及在各国成立科学家休养中心并增进科学工作者在文化方面的关系等问题。
