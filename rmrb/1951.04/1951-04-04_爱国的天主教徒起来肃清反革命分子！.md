Patriotic Catholics Rise Up to Purge Counter-Revolutionaries!
    Xu Peiqing

In the nationwide movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, Catholics in various places have not forgotten that they are Chinese, and have highly demonstrated their anti-imperialist patriotic spirit by participating in practical patriotic actions. For example, in Wuhan's medical community, many Catholics have participated in the work of the Aid Korea medical teams, and many priests, through school education conferences, have recognized that opposing imperialism is not opposing religious belief, and have understood the principle of loving the people and the motherland, thus successively guaranteeing to strive to serve the people's cause. In the churches of Wuchang, where doctrines that blurred the lines between friend and foe, distorted by imperialism regarding love, forgiveness, and tolerance, were traditionally preached, the Chinese priests who have now stood up are also loudly calling on their fellow Catholics to oppose America and love the country. Some young Catholics have joined military cadre schools to dedicate themselves to building the nation's defense, while Catholic friends in rural or urban areas have participated in the land reform movement and are working hard to respond to the government's production and construction efforts.

However, the devils, the imperialist elements who have always used religion as a cover for aggression, are at this time employing their means of threats and inducements. Coordinating with the desperate struggles of American imperialism's dying war and the sabotage activities of the remnant bandit gang in Taiwan, they are spreading reactionary fallacies among our Catholic friends, using issues of faith, divine authority, and religious texts. The reactionary document called "Reference Materials for the Catholic Three-Self Patriotic Movement," which was secretly distributed by those exploited by imperialist elements, as reported in the Yangtze Daily on March 19th, is a complete conspiracy. First, let us analyze its first major paragraph. The first sentence of the document is "The Catholic Church was personally established by Jesus and passed down by the Apostles, the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church"… "is supra-national and supra-political." The so-called supra-national and supra-political statement is deceptive. Looking back, when Hitler attacked Stalingrad, the bishop wearing a cross, representing the Pope, also congratulated Hitler, which was clearly not for religious affairs or faith. The scum of the Catholic Church—Yu Bin, in his sacred capacity as bishop, mingled with the stinking ranks of the reactionary Chiang bandit gang. I personally saw him wearing a cross, presenting a medal given by Chiang Kai-shek to Marshall, who massacred the Chinese people. Is this called supra-national and supra-political? Further down it says, "The Catholicism of a certain country is just a schism," implying that in today's China, where the people have stood up, adding the words "of the motherland" to one's faith is not appropriate. However, please recall, fellow Catholics, that in the past, whenever there was a war in China, churches with French people would hang the French flag, churches with British people would hang the British flag, and churches with Americans would hang the American flag, even in peacetime. They were afraid that the Chinese people wouldn't see them, so they even painted their respective flags on the church doors. The Catholic Church on Chezhan Road, even today, is still called the French Catholic Church. The imperialists have plundered the sacred halls for themselves. I think it is not the patriotic Catholics of the new China who are creating a schism, but rather the imperialist elements who harbor the ambition to divide China. Today, as our new China becomes stronger, the American imperialists, who use the church as a cover, are shamelessly talking about being supra-political in order to divide our united forces, wanting us not to interfere in the politics of our own people, while they tightly grasp the church, often creating religious cases to invade us. Before liberation, they used the church, distorted religious doctrines, and carried out cultural and economic aggression to poison us. Is this called supra-political? Imperialism wants us not to transcend its politics of exploiting the people, but to love and participate in the politics owned by the people themselves. The answer from us patriotic Chinese Catholic friends is to transcend the imperialist politics of exploiting the people and to love and participate in the politics that belong to the people themselves. The end of the first paragraph says, "Our Catholic Church has never had any connection with any imperialism, so there is no such thing as severing connections." May I ask, regarding Austin's fallacy that the United States subsidized the Vatican with American dollars, we have not heard any refutation from the Vatican to this day. Is it a tacit agreement, or is there some hidden pain?

Let us now look at "Autonomy" in the second major paragraph. It says, "To gradually have the missionary district governed by native bishops in accordance with canon law." Look at the "gradually" used here, how wonderful! I want to ask, how long will this "gradually" continue? I think in the eyes of American imperialism, it will "gradually" continue until the end of the world! The imperialists look down on the Chinese people, thinking that the Chinese are incapable. In the past, many Chinese bishops encountered countless obstacles and difficulties from the imperialists. They made a mess of China, and then ridiculed the Chinese for being incompetent. Are the Chinese really incompetent? How was the inflation of more than ten years stabilized, how were floods and droughts controlled, how was American imperialism's aggression against China repelled? Just citing a few examples is enough to fully illustrate that the Chinese can manage their own country and manage it very well. The Chinese can naturally manage their own church that they believe in. Is it really in accordance with canon law to have those foreigners with imperialist ideas manage the church in China? Let us observe India's demand for autonomy; the British imperialists' policy was "gradually." Annam's demand for freedom was met by the French imperialists with "gradually" to deceive, and with troops to kill. The Philippines is independent on the surface, but the "gradual" ruling power of the United States is still alive and well. Now the American imperialists still want to use this set of tricks for ruling colonies on the church in China. If it is really as they say, then this is truly losing the true essence of autonomy. Looking at its "Self-support," it states, "The church does not accept financial assistance from abroad or from within the country with any political background." We all know that before liberation, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) under the control of the United States gave much assistance to the church in China, and some American priests even participated in the work of the agency. Even Austin said that he had subsidized the Chinese Catholic Church a lot. Does UNRRA have a political background? What is Austin's so-called assistance? Today, patriotic Catholic friends must sever this assistance with a political background and use their own strength to manage. It instead threatens, "If it cannot circulate freely... it will become like draining a pond to catch all the fish." Is it really necessary to use the bloody money made from war profits for our sacred church to circulate freely? The intention is obvious to our Catholic friends. As for "Self-propagation," it says, "When native clergy have not been sufficiently produced or are insufficient for missionary needs, then foreign clergy must be allowed to help with missionary work." This is exactly providing cover for foreign clergy who are imperialist elements. We see that most of the foreign clergy live in major cities, in tall buildings and mansions, while the Chinese priests are mostly preaching in remote rural areas, braving wind and rain. To say that there are not enough Chinese clergy is precisely to explain what the foreign clergy have been doing under the word "gradually" for the past two or three hundred years. Furthermore, people like Mao Zhenxiang sent Chinese monks and nuns to the United States in stages for "advanced studies," which further illustrates what the imperialist elements are "self-propagating" through the church! It is precisely this kind of self-propagation that has led some Chinese Catholic friends to take pride in being able to listen to sermons in English, considering it beautiful to confess sins in French, and even singing hymns and chanting scriptures in English to show their piety. Does God not like or cannot hear if we use Chinese? This self-degradation of national subjugation is precisely created by the imperialist elements in the name of "self-propagation." Think about it, Catholic friends, how heartbreaking!

Finally, the third major paragraph more bluntly opposes our patriotic priests and Catholic friends from participating in anti-imperialist political activities. It says, "Moreover, church laws strictly prohibit priests from engaging in political activities in their transcendent role of dedicating themselves to the church." May I ask, which of our Catholic friends has ever heard or seen any church discipline for people like Yu Bin? Does it mean that participating in the political activities of the lewd and murderous imperialists is not strictly prohibited, but participating in the people's political activities for peace and anti-oppression is strictly prohibited? Alas! Where does this so-called "Learning Reference" represent the sanctity of the church? Where is the inspiration of the Holy Spirit in the "Three-Selfs" mentioned therein? Let us simply treat it as the "Voice of America," and there is nothing more appropriate than this.

As for the Three-Self Patriotic Movement to be implemented by patriotic Catholics, it is, as we stated in our declaration, a patriotic movement that maintains our pure and complete religious beliefs and severs all ties with imperialism.

Patriotic Catholic friends, after we have exposed how imperialist elements use and spread reactionary propaganda through the church organization, we must no longer blindly listen to these rumors. We must vigorously suppress counter-revolutionary elements and raise our vigilance. Recently, Tianjin cracked the American-Chiang special agent organizations "Catholic Patriotic Group" and "People's National Construction Promotion Association," seizing reactionary documents such as radios and pistols. We should be vigilant at all times, and should also actively assist the People's Government to completely eliminate these American and Chiang Kai-shek's accomplices, and not allow our sacred halls—churches—to become the "air-raid shelters" for special agents and bandits, and not allow our pure beliefs to become the breeding ground for imperialist germs. Resolutely and thoroughly smash the conspiracy of special agents and bandits, unite as one, and dedicate ourselves to resisting America and aiding Korea, and devote ourselves to production and construction. Pious Chinese Catholics, stand up, and gloriously be Chinese people! (Reprinted from Yangtze Daily)

　　爱国的天主教徒起来肃清反革命分子！
    许培卿
    在举国一致的抗美援朝运动中，各地的天主教徒，没有忘记了自己是中国人，并高度地发挥了反帝爱国精神，参加了爱国的实际行动。如武汉的医务界，就有不少的教徒参加了援朝医疗队的工作，许多神父们，也通过学校教育会议认识了反对帝国主义不是反对宗教信仰，懂得了爱人民祖国的道理，因而相继的保证，努力为人民的事业而服务。在武昌的教堂里，一向是宣讲些敌友不分为帝国主义所歪曲了的爱仇容忍的道理，而今日，站起来了的中国神父们，也大声疾呼的号召教友们反美爱国了。有一些青年教徒们，参加了军事干部学校为建设祖国的国防而效忠，农村或城市的教友，也参加了土地改革运动，并为响应政府的生产建设而努力。
    可是魔鬼们，一向是借着宗教做为侵略掩护的帝国主义分子们却于此时施展他们的威胁利诱的手段了。他们配合着美帝国主义垂死挣扎的疯狂战争，以及台湾残余匪帮的破坏活动，在我们教友中利用信仰问题神权教典等，又散布起反动的谰言。在三月十九日，长江日报所载，关于受帝国主义分子所利用而暗地散发的所谓“天主教三自运动学习参考”的破坏教友爱国的反动文件，就是十足的阴谋之一。首先让我们来分析它的第一大段吧，文件第一句是“天主教系耶稣亲自建立，由宗徒传下来的，至一至公的神圣教会”……“是超国际、超政治的”。所谓超国际超政治这句话是欺人的。回想一下，当希特勒进攻斯大林格勒时，挂着十字架的主教，代表着教宗，也向希魔致贺，这显然不是为了教务与信仰。天主教的败类——于斌以神圣主教之尊，参杂于反动的蒋匪帮的腥臭之流，我亲眼看见他身佩十字架，向屠杀中国人民的马歇尔胸上挂蒋匪送的勋章，这叫超国际超政治么？下面又说“某某国天主教，只是裂教”，这样说来，在我们中国人民站起来了的今天，要在自己的信仰上，加上祖国的字句都是不应该的了。但是，请教友们回忆一下，中国以往，每当战争时，有法国人所在的堂，则挂法国旗子，有英国人所在的堂，则挂英国旗子，有美国人所在的堂，连平时都要挂美国旗，他们唯恐中国人看不见，还要在堂门口用油漆画上他们各自不同的旗子，现在车站路天主堂，当日甚至于今天，还有人称之为法国天主堂，帝国主义者把神圣的殿都掠为己有了。我看搞成裂教的不是新中国的爱国教徒，倒是那些怀有瓜分中国野心的帝国主义分子所为。当我们新中国强大起来了的今天，以教会做幌子的美帝国主义者，为了要分散我们的团结力量，他们就腼不知耻地说什么超政治，要我们不过问自己人民的政治，而他们却紧紧的抓住教会，常常造成教案来侵略我们。解放前，利用教会，歪曲教义，进行文化经济侵略来毒死我们，难道这是超政治么？帝国主义是要我们不超他的政治，而超人民的政治，我们爱国的中国天主教友的回答是，超脱剥削人民的帝国主义政治，而要热爱参加为人民自己所有的政治。第一段末尾说“吾天主教教会，与任何帝国主义，既不曾发生联系，自无所谓斩断联系，”试问奥斯汀的谰言内有美国津贴梵蒂岗美金一事，我们一直到今天，都没有听到任何来自梵蒂岗的反驳，是默认了呢，还是有隐痛呢？
    我们再来看第二大段内的“自治”，它说“要使传教区渐由本籍主教，遵照教规治理教务”，请看这一“渐”字，用的多妙，我要问问渐到何时为止啊？我看在美帝国主义的眼光里，是要渐到世界末日吧！帝国主义者看不起中国人，认为中国人是不行，以前圣几位主教，不知遭到多少帝国主义的阻碍与非难，他们把中国搞成一团糟，反而讥讽中国人无能。中国人真的无能吗？十余年的通货膨胀怎样平稳的，水旱灾怎样治救的，美帝国主义对中国的侵略怎样打退的，只举几端，就充分能说明了中国人能管理自己的国家，并且治理的很好，中国人自然也能管理自己所信仰的教会，难道硬要那些带有帝国主义思想的外国人，管理在中国的教会，就合乎教典么？我们试观印度的要求自治，英帝国主义对付的政策就是“渐”，安南的要自由，法帝国主义就用“渐”来哄，用兵来杀，菲律宾表面是独立了，可是美国之“渐”的统治势力仍健在，现在美帝国主义却把统治殖民地的一套法术，仍想用之于在中国的教会身上，如果真如它所说，这才真是失掉了自治的真谛。再看它的“自养”内载“教会不接受国外以及国内任何有政治背景的资助”我们都知道，在解放前，美国操纵下的救济总署，给了在中国的教会许多资助，并且还有些美国神父亲自参加该署工作，连奥斯汀都说资助了中国天主教很多，救济总署是不是有政治背景呢？奥斯汀所谓资助是什么呢？今日爱国的教友们要割断这些有政治背景的资助，用自己的力量来办。它反而恐吓的说，“不能全身流通……势成竭池而渔”，难道非要用发战争财的血腥钱，我们神圣的教会，才能全身流通了么？用意何在，教友们一望而知。至于“自传”内所云“本籍教士，尚未充分产生或不够传教需要的时候，那就不得不让外籍教士帮助传教”这正是替帝国主义分子的外籍教士作掩护，我们看见多是外国教士，住在通都大邑，高楼广厦，而中国神父们，大都是在穷乡僻壤，栉风沐雨在传教。要说中国教士不够，那正是说明了两三百年以来，外籍教士，在“渐”字之下，干了些什么。其他如毛振翔之流，把中国的修道士及修女们，分期的送到美国去“进修”，那更是说明了帝国主义分子通过教会在“自传”些什么！也正是这种自传，传得有些中国教友，以能听英语讲道为荣，悔罪要能讲法语为美，连唱诗念经都要用英文才表现得虔诚，难道用中国话，天主就不喜欢或听不见么？这种亡国奴的自贱性，正是帝国主义分子，借“自传”之名而造成的，教友们想想看，多么痛心！
    最后第三大段，更露骨地反对我们爱国的神父教友们参加反对帝国主义的政治活动，它说“加以教会法令，又严禁司铎以献身教会的超然身份，作政治活动”，请问我们那一位教友，曾经听说或看见教会，对于斌之流有什么教会处分？难道说参加那淫乱杀人的帝国主义的政治活动就不严禁，反倒参加为和平反压迫而奋斗的人民政治活动就遭严禁么？唉！这一篇所谓“学习参考”，那儿是代表着教会的圣洁？这其中所说的“三自”，又那儿是圣灵的默启啊？让我们干脆地把它当做“美国之音”来看，是再没有比这更恰当的了。
    至于爱国的天主教友，所要实行的三自运动，是我们在宣言上所说明的，那就是保持我们纯洁完整的宗教信仰与帝国主义割断一切关系的爱国运动。
    爱国的教友们，当我们揭穿了帝国主义分子怎样利用和通过教会的组织散布反动的宣传之后，我们不要再人云亦云地听信这些谣言，我们要大力地镇压反革命分子，提高我们的警觉。最近天津破获的美蒋特务组织“公教报国团”以及“民众建国协进会”，搜出电台手枪等反动证件，我们就应该随时谨防，并且还应该积极地协助人民政府，完全肃清这些美国及蒋匪介石的爪牙，不要让我圣洁的殿——教会，做了特务匪徒们的“防空洞”，不要让我们纯正的信仰，做了帝国主义的毒菌的培植所，坚决地、彻底地粉碎特务匪徒的阴谋，万众一心，团结一致，为抗美援朝而效命，为生产建设而献身。虔诚的中国天主教徒，站起来吧，光荣地做一个中国人民！（转载长江日报）
