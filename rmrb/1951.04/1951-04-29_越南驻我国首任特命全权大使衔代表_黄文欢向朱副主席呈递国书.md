　　Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: Hoang Van Hoan, the first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, accompanied by First Secretary Chau Luong, Second Secretary Hoang Nguyen, and Second Secretary Pham Binh, presented his credentials to Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government of China, at 4:00 PM today. Present were Li Kenong, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government; Nie Rongzhen, Acting Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; Wang Bingnan, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Yu Xinqing, Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies of the Central People's Government; Chen Jiakang, Acting Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Wang Zhuoru, Chief of the Protocol Department. When Ambassador Hoang Van Hoan presented his credentials, he delivered a eulogy to Vice Chairman Zhu De, who then delivered a reply.
  The Vietnamese Representative's Eulogy:
    Your Excellency Chairman,
    I have the honor to present to you the Letter of Credence from the President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam appointing me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the People's Republic of China.
    Your Excellency Chairman, in presenting my Letter of Credence, allow me to extend, on behalf of the President of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the entire people, our sincere respect to you and the great Chinese people. At the same time, I would like to congratulate the Chinese people, under your wise leadership, on the glorious victories they have achieved in fighting domestic and foreign enemies and in carrying out economic and cultural construction.
    Your Excellency Chairman, the peoples of Vietnam and China have a long and deep friendship. Our two countries are not only geographically adjacent, but also have close relations in politics, economics, culture, and customs. Most importantly, the peoples of Vietnam and China have always fought for a common ideal, namely, to oppose the oppression of imperialism and to strive for national independence, freedom, and prosperity.
    The great and heroic Soviet Red Army's destruction of German and Japanese fascism in Europe and Asia provided favorable conditions for the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Furthermore, the victory of the heroic Chinese people's liberation struggle and the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been a powerful encouragement to the Vietnamese people, who are fighting against French and American imperialists. I firmly believe that the friendly cooperation between the peoples of Vietnam and China will be increasingly consolidated and developed, and will contribute to the peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    Your Excellency Chairman, I will sincerely strive to enhance the inherent brotherly friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China. I earnestly hope that you and the Government of the People's Republic of China will provide assistance and support so that I can fulfill the mission entrusted to me.
  Vice Chairman Zhu's Reply:
    Mr. Representative,
    I am very pleased to accept the Letter of Credence presented by Your Excellency Representative from the President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and I thank Your Excellency for your warm congratulations.
    China and Vietnam are neighboring countries, and not only have a far-reaching and close relationship in history and culture, but also a brotherly and intimate friendship between the peoples of our two countries. In recent centuries, the Chinese and Vietnamese people have waged a long and courageous struggle against the imperialists for the independence and freedom of their respective nations. Therefore, the sympathy and understanding existing between the peoples of our two countries is also very deep. Now that China and Vietnam have established diplomatic relations, I firmly believe that this will not only further consolidate and develop the long-standing friendship between the peoples of our two countries, but will also contribute to the lasting peace of Asia and the world.
    I warmly welcome Your Excellency to assume the post of the first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the People's Republic of China, and I am willing to provide as much assistance as possible to Your Excellency's work.
    I wish your country prosperity, your people thriving, and the Head of your State good health.

    主席阁下，在向您呈递国书的时候，让我代表越南民主共和国政府主席和全体人民向您和伟大的中国人民致真挚的敬意。同时，并对在您英明领导下的中国人民在打击国内外敌人及进行经济、文化建设等方面所获得的光辉胜利，表示祝贺。
    主席阁下，越中两国人民有着悠久而深厚的友谊。我们两国不仅国境毗连，而且在政治、经济、文化以及风俗习惯上都存在着亲密的关系，尤其重要的是越中两国人民始终为着一个共同的理想，即为反对帝国主义的压迫，为争取国家的独立自由与富强而不断地战斗着。
    由于伟大而英勇的苏联红军在欧亚两洲摧毁了德日法西斯，给越南民主共和国的缔造带来了有利的条件，更由于英勇的中国人民解放斗争的胜利，以及中华人民共和国首先与越南民主共和国建立了正式的外交关系，这对于正在向法国及美国帝国主义者进行斗争的越南人民是个强有力的鼓舞。我深信，越中两国人民的友爱合作将日益巩固与发展，并将对以苏联为首的和平民主阵营有所贡献。

  朱副主席答词代表先生：
    我很高兴地接受贵代表呈递的越南民主共和国主席的国书，并感谢贵代表的热忱祝贺。
    中越两国，国境毗连，不但在历史上、文化上有着深远而密切的关系，而且在两国人民间更存在着兄弟般的亲密友谊。近世纪来，中越人民为了自己民族的独立和自由，与帝国主义者进行了长期而勇敢的斗争，因此，存在于贵我两国人民间的同情与了解，也是非常深切的。现在中越两国已建立了外交关系，我深信，这不仅将使贵我两国人民间久已存在的友谊更加巩固与发展，而且必将有助于亚洲及世界的持久和平。
    我热烈地欢迎阁下出任越南民主共和国驻中华人民共和国首任特命全权大使衔代表，并愿对贵代表的工作尽量予以协助。
