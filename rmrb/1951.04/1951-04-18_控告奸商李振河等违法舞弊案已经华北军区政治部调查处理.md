Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions to the People's Daily

To the Editors:

　　On May 31, 1950, Mr. Zhunzhun lodged a complaint with the People's Supervision Committee of the Central People's Government, accusing unscrupulous merchant Li Zhenhe of colluding with Yu Guangwen, Director of the Administration Department of the North China Military Region Headquarters, and Zhou Zhuanzhong, Deputy Chief of the Supply Section, to engage in malfeasance and violating national economic policies. The People's Supervision Committee forwarded the case to our department for handling. It has now been verified that the accusations are true, and the relevant personnel have been disciplined accordingly. Because Mr. Zhunzhun did not provide a mailing address, we request that you publicly publish the investigation findings and the handling results of this case by our department, in order to respond to Mr. Zhunzhun.

　　Unscrupulous merchant Li Zhenhe is a relative of Yu Guangwen and an old friend of Zhou Zhuanzhong. Taking advantage of this relationship, he twice engaged in production for the North China Military Region Headquarters, from which he profited 260,000 yuan. In February of last year, taking advantage of price fluctuations, Li Zhenhe fraudulently obtained over 800 million yuan of public funds from the Headquarters, set up false accounts, and deposited the money into private banks, earning a monthly interest of 48%. He then used this huge sum of money for speculation and profiteering, disrupting the market and gaining over 100 million yuan, while the Headquarters suffered a loss of 70,000 jin of millet. The criminal even dared to impersonate the Chief of the Section of the Administration Department of the North China Military Region to swindle and deceive people, causing serious political damage to our army. Yu Guangwen and Zhou Zhuanzhong, the leaders of the Administration Department, were aware of this illegal activity but failed to take action and repeatedly accepted bribes from Li Zhenhe. To strictly enforce the law, Li Zhenhe has been sentenced by the Beijing People's Court to two and a half years of imprisonment, and the embezzled money has been recovered. The North China Military Region and the Party Discipline Inspection Committee have given Zhou Zhuanzhong, the derelict cadre, the administrative punishment of dismissal from his post and the Party disciplinary measure of probation within the Party for one year; Yu Guangwen has been given the administrative punishment of dismissal from his post and the Party disciplinary measure of probation within the Party for half a year.

　　We failed to discover and handle this major case of violating national economic policies in a timely manner, and we should conduct a deep self-criticism. We express our sincere gratitude to Mr. Zhunzhun for his spirit of cherishing the people's property and safeguarding national laws and regulations.

　　Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army North China Military Region

　　控告奸商李振河等违法舞弊案已经华北军区政治部调查处理编辑同志：
    一九五○年五月三十一日谆谆先生曾向中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会控告奸商李振河与华北军区司令部管理处处长余光文及供给科副科长周撰中勾结舞弊，违犯国家经济政策一事。人民监察委员会转交我部处理，现已查明属实，并对有关人员分别做了处分。因为谆谆先生未曾写明通讯地址，故请你们将本部对此案调查情况和处理结果公开发表，以便答复谆谆先生。
    奸商李振河系余光文的亲戚，周撰中之老友，他借此关系，曾代华北军区司令部搞机关生产两次，从中得利二十六万元。去年二月间，李振河乘物价波动之际，骗取司令部公款八亿余元，立假户分散存入私人银号，月息四十八分。并利用此项巨款，投机倒把、捣乱市场，从中获利一亿余元，司令部却因此亏损小米七万斤。该犯竟敢冒充华北军区司令部管理处科长，在外招谣撞骗，造成我军政治上的严重损失。司令部管理处领导人余光文、周撰中明知此种违法行为，却不加以处理，且屡次接受李振河贿赂。为严整法纪，李振河已由北京市人民法院判处有期徒刑二年半，并追回赃款。华北军区及党的纪律检查委员会对渎职干部周撰中，予以行政撤职及党内留党察看一年之处分；对余光文给予行政撤职及党内留党察看半年之处分。
    此项违犯国家经济政策的重大案件，我们未能及时发觉和处理，我们应该深刻检讨。对谆谆先生这种爱护人民财产、维护国家法纪的精神，深表感谢。
        中国人民解放军华北军区政治部
