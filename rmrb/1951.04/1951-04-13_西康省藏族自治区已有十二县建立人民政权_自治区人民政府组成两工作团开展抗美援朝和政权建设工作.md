　　Xinhua News Agency, Anya, 9th. Since the establishment of the People's Government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province in November last year, thirteen of the twenty counties in the region have successively convened People's Consultative Conferences or People's Representative Conferences of various ethnic groups. Twelve counties, including Danba, Ganzi, Daofu, Ba'an, Ganzi, Dengke, and Lihua, have established regional autonomous people's governments or joint people's governments of various ethnic groups. At the People's Representative Conferences of various ethnic groups in each county, representatives of the People's Government conveyed the work tasks and unity covenants and other resolutions adopted by the first People's Representative Conference of various ethnic groups in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, and unanimously passed proposals such as training minority ethnic cadres and focusing on supporting production. People of all ethnic groups in each county held grand celebration gatherings to celebrate the establishment of the People's Government of their respective counties.

　　According to a Xinhua News Agency report: In order to further popularize the propaganda and education of resisting America and aiding Korea in the entire region, help remote counties in the region establish people's governments, and strengthen internal unity among ethnic groups, the People's Government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province has formed two work teams, Kangbei and Kangnan, to work in Kangbei's Dege, Dengke and other counties, Kangxibei's Ege and other pastoral areas, and Kangnan's Deying, Dingxiang and other counties. The two work teams have more than 230 people each, and each team has a literary and art work team, a film projection team, a medical team, and a veterinary team, and carries a large number of documents translated into Tibetan, such as the Common Program, various propaganda materials, and the work tasks of the People's Government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region. The two teams also have various gifts for the Tibetan people, such as portraits of Chairman Mao and commemorative badges. The Kangding Branch of the China Native Produce Company has also sent cadres along to plan the restoration and development of local product trade in various places.
