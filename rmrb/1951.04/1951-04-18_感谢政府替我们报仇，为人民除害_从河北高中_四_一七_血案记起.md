Thanks to the Government for Avenging Us and Eliminating Harm for the People
    ——Remembering the “April 17th” Bloodbath at Hebei High School
    Liu Pengzhi

　　One week after the "April 9th" bloodbath at Beijing Normal University on April 17, 1948, Kuomintang secret agents created the "April 17th" bloodbath at Hebei High School.

　　At that time, the secret agents in the school did not attend classes all day, but swaggered around, casually stealing students' letters, beating people, tearing up wall posters, fooling around with women, and engaging in the most despicable and barbaric acts. Of course, they would certainly fail their exams. The secret agent "students" acted like rascals, even threatening and beating teachers with sticks. The teachers were so frightened that they dared not come to school to teach.

　　Based on the students' opinions, the student union decided to hold a teachers and students' get-together on April 17th, hoping to improve the relationship between teachers and students. Who would have thought that the vicious secret agents would arrange a massacre and arrests at the evening party on that day.

　　On the evening of April 17th, before the teachers and students' get-together began, the secret agents locked the school gate and blocked the second gate with stones. The auditorium (venue) and the front door, back door, and backstage were filled with strangers dressed in short clothes, slicked-back hair, and wide belts; these were outside thugs brought in by the secret agents.

　　As soon as the first item of the evening party began, the secret agents shouted from below the stage: "Bastards, get down! Why didn't you sing the 'Party-State Song' first when the meeting started, you motherfuckers!" When the evening party proceeded to the seventh item, a secret agent shouted "Strike!" Immediately, they took out pistols, hand grenades, daggers, iron rods, wooden clubs, and even the large battle swords used by Japanese war criminals, and pounced on the students.

　　I was in the venue at the time and couldn't leave, nor should I have, because I was the host of the evening party (I was the entertainment director of the student union at the time). I was surrounded by thirty or so secret agents. The secret agents stabbed my neck fiercely with a knife, and blood immediately gushed out, staining my front and back chest, soaking through three layers of clothing. Then they hit my face with a club, smashing three teeth. The teeth were in my mouth, and I couldn't speak. Then came a barrage of clubs, and I fell into a pool of blood and passed out. The secret agents dragged me to the principal's office (which had been prepared in advance as a temporary prison), spilling blood all the way. When I woke up, I felt two large cuts on my head, more than an inch long, still bleeding. My face was swollen and bloody, and my left arm and leg were severely injured and could not move. Even after being in prison for more than half a month, I could only move slightly.

　　Fu Zongshun was also beaten at the same time. The secret agents dragged him from upstairs to downstairs, and countless purple blisters appeared on his face, blinding him. Zhang Maoyou was beaten until his head was bleeding. Li Litian's back was beaten by the secret agents with horse whips, leaving welts a third of an inch high, and he couldn't lie on his back for two weeks after being imprisoned. About thirty other students were also beaten, and the secret agents even opened fire on student Peng Ronghuang.

　　The secret agents set up a private court in the school to interrogate students and stabbed Shi Linshan's soles with knives. They declared "martial law" at Hebei High School, and that night, gunshots, the sounds of wooden clubs, screams, and groans mixed together. The next day (April 18th) late at night, the secret agents arrested me and fifteen other students according to a blacklist, and transported us by car to a small house in an unknown location, where we were imprisoned. Our daily food consisted of two small cornbread buns and two small bowls of swill water mixed with dirt. We could only see fifteen minutes of sunlight a day, which was during the three times we were "let out" (to urinate and defecate). Twelve of us sixteen developed dysentery. Our eyes were black, and our legs could not stand. The wicked secret agents tortured us like this for six and a half months.

　　The secret agents' threats, bribery, and deception were useless to us. For three days and three nights, they did not allow Fu Zongshun to sleep, did not give him water to drink, and did not give him food to eat, making him stand on bricks with his hands raised, interrogating him in shifts. On the third day, he fainted on the ground, and the secret agents beat him with coarse hemp ropes dipped in tea water. His nerves were damaged, and even now, half of his body sweats, and the other half does not. Liu Yuzhou was put on the "tiger bench," with a brick placed under him for each question, until four bricks were placed under him, and Liu Yuzhou passed out. The secret agents removed the bricks, waited for Liu to wake up, and then placed them back, repeating the process three times, dying three times. One of the fellow inmates was dragged out and, upon his return, his chest was covered with bloodstains from "branding irons." Two other fellow inmates were dragged out; one died from electrocution, and the other, after returning, hung his head every day and was unaware of eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating.

　　During the "court hearing," the secret agents said fiercely to me: "Do you know what 'disappearance' means? This is what 'disappearance' means! Do you want to go back to school or be a proletarian martyr? Didn't you say that the liberated areas are good? Good! Now the 'government' is considering sending you to the liberated areas 'safely' (burying you alive). You are still young, and I will give you one last minute to consider. Tell us!" My answer was: "I don't know, there's nothing to say! I'm wronged." The secret agent slammed the table and glared at me: "What?! Wronged? Aren't you just being wronged this once? Sun Commander (referring to the bandit chief Sun Lianzhong) buried three hundred in Baoding at one time, and I saw it with my own eyes! Let me tell you, rather kill a hundred by mistake than let one go. There are plenty of high school students in the country, sixteen people are nothing. Look! (He pointed to the large pit dug outside the window) Tonight, we'll push you sixteen people into it, who will know?"

　　The secret agents wanted to use our sixteen lives as stepping stones for promotion and wealth. They used this method, and even more cruel methods than this, to massacre countless patriotic youths. The wicked American-Chiang secret agent bandits, they owe us a blood debt that we can never repay!

　　A blood debt must be paid in blood! Chen Zidan, a Central Statistics Bureau secret agent who stabbed me during the "April 17th" bloodbath at our school and continued to conspire to organize armed riots after liberation, finally could not escape the people's justice and was executed on March 25th. I sincerely thank the People's Government for avenging us and eliminating harm for the people. I firmly support and will assist the government in eliminating all counter-revolutionaries.

　　感谢政府替我们报仇，为人民除害
    ——从河北高中“四·一七”血案记起
    刘鹏志
    一九四八年四月十七日北京师范大学“四·九”血案发生后的一个星期，国民党特务们又在河北高中制造了“四·一七”血案。
    当时，学校里的特务们整天不上课，到处横着膀子晃，随便偷看同学的信，打人，撕壁报，搞女人，干着最卑鄙最野蛮的勾当。当然，他们考试一定不及格。特务“学生”们耍无赖，竟拿着棒子去威胁殴打先生。先生被吓得不敢到校上课。
    学生自治会根据同学们的意见，决定在四月十七日举办师生联欢晚会，想借此改善师生间这种关系。谁料到狠毒的特务们，却布置好在这天晚会上屠杀，逮捕。
    四月十七日的晚上，师生联欢晚会开始之前，特务们把校门上了锁，二门顶上石头。礼堂（会场）周围及前门、后门、后台，站满短衣打扮、大背头、宽腰带的面貌生疏的人，这是外来的特务打手。
    晚会第一项刚一开始，特务们就在台下喊起来：“王八蛋，滚下去，为什么开会不先唱‘党国歌’，他妈的！”在晚会进行到第七项时，特务喊了一声“打”，他们登时拿出手枪，手榴弹，匕首，铁棍，木棒，还有日本战犯用的大战刀，扑向同学。
    我当时在会场，不能走也不应该走，因为我是这个晚会的主持人（我当时担任学生自治会康乐股长）。我被三十几个特务包围起来。特务们照着我的脖子猛扎了一刀，血立刻窜了出来，染满了前后胸，浸透了三件衣服；接着照我脸上就是一棒，三个牙齿被打碎，牙打在嘴里，不能讲话了；接着又是一阵乱棍，我倒在血泊中死了过去。特务把我拖到校长室（这是事前准备好的临时囚禁所），鲜血洒了一路。当我醒来的时候，摸着头上有两个一寸多长的大口子，还在流着血。脸上青肿，血肉模糊，左臂及左腿重伤不能动弹，一直到监狱里养了半个多月，也还只能作轻微移动。
    同时被打的还有傅宗舜同学。特务们把他由楼上拖打到楼下，脸上起了无数紫血泡，眼睛看不见东西。张懋有同学被打得头破血流。李立田同学的后背被特务用马棒打得起了三分高的血印，到监狱后两个星期不能仰卧。另外受打的约有三十多个同学，特务并曾开枪射击同学彭荣煌。
    特务们在学校私设了法庭，审讯同学，并用刀子扎史麟山的脚心。他们宣布河北高中“戒严”，当夜枪声，木棒声，惨叫声，呻吟声混成了一片。次日（四月十八日）深夜，特务按黑名单捕走我和另外十五个同学，用汽车把我们运到一个不知道是什么地方的小屋里，关了起来。每天的饭食是两个小窝头和两小碗掺加了泥土的涮锅水。一天只能见到十五分钟的阳光，还是三次“放茅”（大小便）的时间。我们十六人中有十二人闹了痢疾。我们两眼漆黑，腿都不能站立。万恶的特务，就这样折磨了我们六个半月。
    特务们的威胁，利诱，欺骗，对于我们是没有用的。有三天三夜，他们不许傅宗舜同学睡觉，不给水喝，不给饭吃，让他站在砖上，举着双手，轮流审问。第三天他昏倒在地上，特务们就用粗麻绳沾茶水打他。他的神经被打坏了，直到现在还是半个身子出汗，半个身子不出汗。刘育周同学上了“老虎凳”，垫一块砖问一句，一直垫到四块，刘育周同学死了过去。特务们撤了砖，待刘同学苏醒过来再垫，反复三次，死去三次。同屋的一个难友，拉出去再回来之后，前胸满是“烙铁”烙的血印。另外两个同屋难友被拉出去，一个受电刑死了，一个回来后，每天搭拉着脑袋，吃、喝、拉、尿，什么都不懂了。
    “过堂”的时候，特务凶狠地对我说：“你懂什么叫失踪吗？这就叫失踪！你想回去上学还是要做一个无产阶级的烈士？你不是说解放区好吗？好！现在‘政府’正在考虑把你们‘安全地’送到解放区去（活埋）。你还年青，我给你最后一分钟考虑的时间。还是说了吧！”我的回答是：“不知道，没有什么可说的！我冤枉。”特务把桌子一拍，眼一瞪：“什么？！冤枉，冤不就冤你这一回吗？孙长官（指匪首孙连仲）在保定一次就埋了三百，我是亲眼看见的！告诉你，宁错杀一百，不放走一个。全国的高中学生有的是，十六个人算不了什么。你看！（他一指窗外挖好的大土坑）晚上把你们十六个人往里一推，谁知道？”
    特务们要拿我们十六条人命，做为升官发财的跳板。他们就用这种方法，甚至比这个更惨酷的方法，不知屠杀了多少爱国青年。万恶的美蒋特务匪徒们，他们欠下了我们还不清的血债！
    血债血还！在我校制造“四·一七”血案，曾经扎过我一刀的，解放后仍继续阴谋组织武装暴动的中统特务陈子丹，终于逃不出人民的法网，已于三月二十五日被枪决了。我从内心感谢人民政府替我们报了仇，为人民除了害。我坚决拥护并将协助政府肃清一切反革命分子。
