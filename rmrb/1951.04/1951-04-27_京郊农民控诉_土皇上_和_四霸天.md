　　Farmers in the Suburbs of Beijing Accuse "Local Emperors" and "Four Overlords"
　　Wang Zhengren, Peng Jun
　　"If Liu Yongquan isn't executed, Yongtai Village can't live; if Wu Delu isn't executed, Shuangquan Fort won't have peace." Farmer representative Cui Yuyang from Liudaokou, at the Qinghe Town farmers' accusation meeting on April 23 against special agent and tyrant Liu Yongquan and Wu Delu, said the painful words that were in the farmers' hearts. All four thousand attendees raised their fists and shouted: "Grievances have causes, debts have debtors, we want revenge! We demand the government to stand up for the people and execute these two special agent tyrants who have done all kinds of evil to avenge us!"
　　Liu Yongquan was a special agent of the Kuomintang bandit gang and a tyrant in Anning Village, in the northern suburbs, nicknamed "Local Emperor." In 1946, he served as the puppet head of Anning Village, a puppet conscription committee member, and the head of the puppet self-defense corps in seventeen nearby villages. He had organized a spy team to probe for information on the People's Liberation Army; he privately set up courts to torture farmers and extort money from the masses, amounting to over 1,000 shi of old corn. He conscripted soldiers for the Kuomintang, forcing Liu Wenjin and three others to their deaths, and making Zhao Deben's mother blind with grief. Poor farmer Liu Yong, when accusing the "Local Emperor" of causing the death of three members of his family, gnashed his teeth and said: "In 1946, this kid grabbed my son Liu Wenjin and sold him to another village as a soldier for a price of 1.8 million yuan in puppet currency. Later, my son suffered torture and died in the puppet army. My daughter-in-law was so angry and anxious that she fell ill and died. The baby, only a few months old, had no one to feed it and starved to death right before my eyes. Now, I am the only old man left in the whole family." Woman Song Dezhen accused, "Before liberation, Liu Yongquan repeatedly extorted my family, forcing my father to flee to Haidian, and he threatened, 'If you don't come back, I'll burn down your house and kill you.' After liberation, he pretended to be a PLA worker and sent my father to drive a cart for him. On the way, he took a stick and wanted to beat my father to death, and defrauded him of 290,000 yuan and 2 shi of old corn. My father was so angry that he cried day and night, and died not long after." Song Deshan accused: "After liberation, Liu Yongquan did not change his thieving nature, he also extorted 35 shi of corn from us, and cut off the power lines of the PLA garrison. When the government led us to dig ditches for flood prevention, he threatened us with a shovel, saying, 'Whoever dares to move a piece of my soil, I will fight him to the death.' What are we keeping this kind of bad egg around for?!" The day after the North Suburb Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau arrested Liu Yongquan, 56 farmers wrote letters or went to the North Suburb Branch to accuse him.
　　Wu Delu was a special agent of the Central Unification Bureau (CC Clique), a tyrant in Liudaokou in the northern suburbs of Beijing, nicknamed "Four Overlords." During the rule of the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang, he successively served as the puppet head, the deputy head of the self-defense team, etc., and consistently oppressed the people, raped women, and committed all kinds of evil, and had forced six people to death. After liberation, he showed no remorse, hid guns, and refused to register. Later, he was arrested by our Public Security North Suburb Branch and transferred to the court for handling. The wife of victim Li Kuan, tearfully accused Wu Delu of the tragic killing of her husband: "Wu Delu, you son of a bitch, in the old society you held the sun in your hand, and the poor had no hope. In 1947, you came to my house like a fierce god, and without asking any questions, you tied up my husband and brought him to the Bao Public Office, insisting that he was a tomb robber. You hung him up and beat him with jujube wood sticks, and also beat him with a carrying pole. One carrying pole was broken into three pieces, and he was beaten until his whole body was covered in blood. Wu Delu, you have the heart of a wolf! You insisted that my husband confess to being a tomb robber. He refused, so you poured cold water mixed with millet into his mouth, and patted his stomach with an iron hoe, beating him until he vomited and bled from all seven orifices, and then sprayed him with cold water to wake him up and bury him alive. After burying him halfway, you pulled him out again. He was still breathing, so you beat him to death. I demand that the government execute Wu Delu and dig out his heart to offer as a sacrifice to my husband." The accusation meeting was conducted in an atmosphere of grief and anger for more than two hours. When the meeting adjourned, the two special agent tyrants were escorted out of the venue, and the masses pointed at them and cursed: If it weren't for liberation, all the good people around Qinghe Town would have been killed by them.

　　京郊农民控诉“土皇上”和“四霸天”
    王政人　彭军
    “毙不了刘永泉，永泰庄就不能活；毙不了吴德禄，太平不了双泉堡。”六道口的农民代表崔鱼洋，在四月二十三日清河镇农民控诉特务恶霸刘永泉、吴德禄的会上，沉痛地说出了农民的心里话，到会的四千多人都举起拳头高喊：“冤有头，债有主，我们要报仇啊！要求政府给人民做主，把这两个作恶万端的特务恶霸崩了，报仇！”
    刘永泉是国民党匪帮的特务，北郊安宁庄恶霸，外号“土皇上”。他在一九四六年当过安宁庄的伪保长，伪征兵委员和附近十七个村子的伪自卫团团长。他曾组织过谍报队，刺探解放军情报；私设公堂非刑拷打农民，敲诈勒索群众钱财达一千石老玉米以上。他给国民党抓兵，逼死刘文金等四人，把赵德本的母亲急得瞎了眼。贫农刘永控诉“土皇上”害死他一家三口的情形时，咬牙切齿地说：“一九四六年，这小子抓走了我儿子刘文金，他以伪币一百八十万元的代价卖给别的村当兵。以后我儿子受折磨，死在伪军里。儿媳妇又气又急，得病死了。几个月的孩子没人喂奶，眼看着活活饿死。现在全家就剩了我孤伶伶的一个老头子。”妇女宋德珍控诉道：“解放前，刘永泉屡次三番向我家敲诈，逼得我爹逃到海甸，他还恐吓说：“要是不回来，把你家房子给烧了，人给弄死。”解放后，他冒充八路军工作人员，派我爹给他赶大车。半道上，他拿棒子要打死我爹，又诈去二十九万块钱和二石老玉米。我爹给他气得日夜流泪，不多日子就死啦。”宋德山控诉道：“解放后，刘永泉贼性不改，他还敲诈咱们三十五石玉米，剪断解放军驻军的电线。政府领导咱们挖沟防涝，他拿着铁锹威胁我们说：“谁敢动我一块土，我就跟他玩命。”这种坏蛋还留他干什么？！”北京市公安局北郊分局逮捕刘永泉的第二天，就有五十六个农民写信或亲自跑到北郊分局控诉。
    吴德禄是中统特务，北京市北郊六道口的恶霸，外号“四霸天”。他在日伪及国民党统治时期，曾先后充当伪保长，自卫队分队长等职，一贯欺压人民，强奸妇女，无恶不作，曾逼死和杀害六条人命。解放后，他毫不悔悟，隐匿枪枝，拒不登记。后经我公安北郊分局逮捕归案，转送法院办理。被害人李宽的老婆，痛哭流涕地控诉吴德禄杀害她丈夫的惨痛经过说：“吴德禄你这忘八孙子，在旧社会你把太阳捏在手里，穷人暗无天日。一九四七年，你凶神恶煞般地到我家中，不问青红皂白，五花大绑把我当家的（丈夫）给弄到保公所，一口咬定硬说他是盗墓贼。你把他吊起来用枣木棍子抽，还用扁担打，一条扁担打断成三截，把人打的浑身是血道道。吴德禄，你生的是狼心狗肺啊！你硬要我们当家的承认是盗墓贼，他不肯，你就用凉水掺小米往嘴里灌，用铁铣拍打肚子，打得上吐下拉，七窍流血，再用凉水喷醒过来给活埋了。埋了半截，又把他拉出来，人还有口气，你又活活地把他打死了。我要求政府崩了吴德禄，挖出他的心来看看，给我们当家的祭一祭。”控诉会在悲愤激昂的气氛中进行了两个多小时，散会时，这两个恶霸特务被押出会场，群众指着他们骂道：要不是解放，清河镇周围的好人都要给他们杀光了。
