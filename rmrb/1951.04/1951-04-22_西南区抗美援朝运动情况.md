　　The Resist-America-Aid-Korea movement in various parts of the Southwest region has made new progress in the first quarter of this year, and unprecedented large-scale mass parades, gatherings, accusations, and propaganda campaigns are underway.
　　From November of last year to the end of March this year, according to preliminary statistics, more than 2.82 million people in the Southwest region participated in anti-American and patriotic rallies and demonstrations. The number of people who received patriotic education through other means is even greater. The patriotic movement in the Southwest region is now expanding from small cities to rural areas. Most counties in the North Sichuan Administrative Office region have organized propaganda teams to go to the countryside; in the East Sichuan Administrative Office region, 23 of the 34 counties and cities have established organizations for the Resist-America-Aid-Korea Association. In the Chongqing urban area, 90 percent of the people have received propaganda and education. In Chengdu, approximately 70 percent of the population has received propaganda.
　　The patriotic movement in the Southwest region is still progressing poorly in small cities and rural areas. Only a few places in minority areas have begun to develop it, and the movement in Xikang Province is not being carried out sufficiently. The leading organs of the Southwest region have issued instructions, calling on all localities to immediately formulate plans and urge their subordinates to strictly implement them, striving to have 60 percent of the population in the region participate in the signature and voting campaign to support the conclusion of a peace treaty and oppose the arming of Japan. The instructions stipulate that all localities designate dedicated personnel to inspect, summarize, and regularly guide the progress of the Resist-America-Aid-Korea movement.

　　西南区抗美援朝运动情况
    西南各地的抗美援朝运动在今年第一季中已有新的进展，空前大规模的群众游行、集会、控诉、宣传运动正在展开。
    自去年十一月至今年三月底止，据初步统计，西南全区共有二百八十二万以上的人民群众参加了反美爱国的集会和游行示威。通过其他各种方式受到爱国教育的人数更多。西南区的爱国运动现正由小城市推向农村。川北行署区大部分县份组织了宣传队下乡；川东行署区三十四个县市中已有二十三个县建立了抗美援朝会的组织。重庆市区有百分之九十的人受到了宣传教育。成都市亦约有百分之七十的人口受到了宣传。
    西南区的爱国运动在小城市和农村中，仍然进行得很差，少数民族地区仅有少数地方开始发展，西康省运动开展很不够。西南区领导机关已发出指示，号召各地立即订出计划，并督促所属严格执行，争取全区百分之六十的人口参加拥护订立和平公约与反对武装日本的签名投票运动。指示规定各地指定专责人员检查总结与经常指导抗美援朝运动的进行。
