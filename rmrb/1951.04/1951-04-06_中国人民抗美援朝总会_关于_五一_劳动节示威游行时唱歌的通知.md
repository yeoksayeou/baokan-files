　　China People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association
　  Notice Regarding Singing During the "May Day" Labor Day Demonstration Parade
    It is hereby decided that the National Anthem (March of the Volunteers) and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Battle Song (i.e., "Defeat the American Ambition Wolves") will be the basic songs sung by the people of the whole country during the "May Day" Labor Day demonstration parade this year, and everyone should be able to sing them. In order to enable the people of the whole country to universally learn to sing the National Anthem, in addition to formal meetings and ceremonies, the singing can be done without formality. In addition, "The People of the World Unite Tightly" and "Oppose the Arming of Japan" can also be used as parade songs. Among workers and students, the Internationale can be added. Of the above five songs, apart from the National Anthem, which has already been released, and the Internationale, which needs to be reprinted, the remaining three songs are contained in the twelfth issue of the "Current Affairs Handbook" published by the Beijing People's Publishing House, and publishing houses in various regions are welcome to print these five songs into a single volume for widespread dissemination. These five songs will soon be taught by the Central People's Broadcasting Station and local people's broadcasting stations. It is hoped that trade union organizations, workers' night schools, peasant associations, primary and secondary school music teachers, university student associations, troops, government agencies, women's groups, youth groups, cinemas, cultural centers, reading groups, and other groups in various regions will be responsible for promoting and teaching them, and it is hoped that the people of the whole country will work hard to learn these songs, at least learning the National Anthem and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Battle Song, so that they can sing them enthusiastically, skillfully, and neatly during the May Day demonstration.
