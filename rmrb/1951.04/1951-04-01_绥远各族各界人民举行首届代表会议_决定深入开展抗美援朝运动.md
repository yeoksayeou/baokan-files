Xinhua News Agency, Gui Sui, 28th — The first People's Representative Conference of all nationalities and all circles in Suiyuan Province was held from March 15th to 21st. There were 324 representatives attending the conference, including Mongolian, Hui nationalities and people from all walks of life.

The representatives listened to reports from the responsible persons of the Provincial People's Government on the work summary for 1950, the draft budget of financial revenue and expenditure, ethnic issues, and from the responsible persons of the Provincial Military Region Headquarters on military work. The representatives believed that: Because the Provincial People's Government resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instruction of "Unite as one, strive for progress, reform the old system, implement new policies, and strive to build a new Suiyuan for the people," it has made remarkable achievements in all aspects of work in the past year. According to the above reports, nearly one million farmers in the province have carried out anti-despot and rent reduction movements. People's democratic power has been established in both rural and urban areas, and ethnic regional autonomy has been implemented in minority areas. Agricultural production has been significantly improved, approaching pre-war levels in older areas, and exceeding pre-liberation levels in some new areas. The uprising troops and personnel, after appropriate transformation and education, have actively participated in various construction undertakings.

Based on the current demands of the people of Suiyuan, the conference unanimously decided that the general tasks for 1951 are: to continue to deepen the Resist America and Aid Korea movement to defend the country; to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities; to strive to complete land reform this winter and next spring; to step up production and construction; and to strengthen the close unity of people of all nationalities and all circles. The participating representatives unanimously believed that: Farmers, who account for more than 90 percent of the province's rural population, only own about 30 percent of the land, which is the main reason why Suiyuan's rural areas are impoverished and the development of urban industry and commerce is limited. Therefore, to build a new Suiyuan, land reform must be carried out. The representatives believed that: Adequate preparations should be made to strive to complete the land reform work this winter and next spring.

The conference focused on discussing the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities. The representatives at the meeting successively accused the American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents and bandits of murdering people, sabotaging production, spreading rumors and poisoning people. The representatives believed that: It is necessary to deeply publicize the regulations for punishing counter-revolutionaries, raise the awareness of the broad masses of the people against the sabotage activities of special agents, mobilize the masses to report counter-revolutionaries, vigorously eliminate bandits, and adopt methods such as mutual assistance between urban and rural areas and joint defense in various regions to thoroughly eliminate bandits and hidden special agents. This is how to lay a solid foundation for implementing land reform this winter and next spring. Representatives of ethnic minorities also unanimously stated that: Suppressing counter-revolutionary activities is a common task for all ethnic groups, and we must work together to carry it out. Mongolian representative Tubuxin said: Some counter-revolutionaries fled to the grasslands, masquerading as lamas, we must vigorously report and eliminate them.

The participating representatives are full of confidence in thoroughly realizing the province's tasks for 1951. The conference unanimously adopted the "Resolution on Popularizing and Deepening the Patriotic Movement to Resist America and Aid Korea in the Province" and the Letter to the People of the Province.

Finally, the conference elected Su Qianyi as the chairman of the Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultation Committee, Yang Zhilin, Yao Zhe, Kuibi (Mongolian), Sun Lanfeng (uprising general) as vice-chairmen, and a total of 59 members.

　　绥远各族各界人民举行首届代表会议        
    决定深入开展抗美援朝运动
    【新华社归绥二十八日电】绥远省首届各民族各界人民代表会议，已于三月十五日至二十一日举行。出席会议的代表有蒙、回民族及各界人士三百二十四人。
    代表们听取了省人民政府负责人关于一九五○年工作总结、财政收支概算、民族问题和省军区司令部负责人关于军事工作的报告。代表们认为：由于该省人民政府坚决执行了毛主席的“团结一致，力求进步，改革旧制度，实行新政策，为建设人民的新绥远而奋斗”的指示，一年来在各项工作上都做出了显著的成绩。根据上述报告，全省近一百万的农民已进行了反恶霸和减租运动。农村和城市都已建立了人民民主政权，在少数民族地区，并实行了民族区域自治。农业生产有显著的提高，在较老区已接近战前水平，有的新区也超过了解放前的水平。起义的部队和人员，经过适当的改造教育后，都积极地参加了各项建设事业。
    会议根据绥远人民当前的要求，一致决定一九五一年总的任务是：继续深入抗美援朝保家卫国运动；坚决镇压反革命活动；争取今冬明春完成土地改革；加紧生产建设；加强各民族各界人民的亲密团结等。与会代表一致认为：占该省农村人口百分之九十以上的农民，只占有百分之三十左右的土地，这是绥远农村陷于贫困和城市工商业发展受到限制的主要原因。因此，要建设新绥远，就必须进行土地改革。代表们认为：应充分地做好准备工作，争取在今冬明春完成土地改革工作。
    会议着重讨论了镇压反革命活动的问题。代表们在会上纷纷控诉美蒋特务匪徒们杀害人命、破坏生产、造谣放毒等罪行。代表们认为：必须深入宣传惩治反革命条例，提高广大人民对特务分子破坏活动的警惕性，发动群众检举反革命分子，大力清剿土匪，采取城乡互助、地区联防等办法，彻底肃清土匪和暗藏的特务分子，这样才能为今冬明春实行土地改革打下有力的基础。少数民族代表们也一致表示：镇压反革命活动是各民族共同的事情，必须同心协力来进行。蒙民代表图布信说：有些反革命分子逃到草地，混充喇嘛，我们一定要大力检举和肃清。
    与会代表对于彻底实现该省一九五一年的任务充满着信心。会议一致通过了“为普及和深入本省抗美援朝爱国运动”的决议和告全省人民书。
    最后，会议选出省人民代表会议协商委员会主席苏谦益，副主席杨植霖、姚哲、奎壁（蒙族）、孙兰峰（起义将领）及委员共五十九人。
