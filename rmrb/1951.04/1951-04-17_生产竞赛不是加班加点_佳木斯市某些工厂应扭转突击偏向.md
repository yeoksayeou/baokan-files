　　Production Competition Is Not Overtime
　　Certain Factories in Jiamusi City Should Reverse the Tendency Towards Crash Programs

Comrade Editor:

Since the unfolding of the patriotic production competition in various factories in Jiamusi City, significant achievements have been made thanks to the efforts of the city's working class. However, due to the lack of a correct understanding of production competition by some enterprise leaders, and the existence of a simple task completion viewpoint, serious overtime phenomena have occurred in the competition.

In the weaving, sizing, and roving workshops of the Jiamusi Textile Factory, since the launch of the competition on February 15th, many workers have fallen ill due to poor sanitation, tight schedules, and inadequate food and sleep. According to statistics from the factory's clinic, the employee sickness rate was 33.8% of the total workforce in January, rising to 36% in February. At its worst, 16 out of 129 workers in weaving workshop's Group B fell ill in a single day, seriously affecting the completion of production tasks. However, instead of improving work methods, adjusting labor organization, and reducing employee illness, the factory leaders shortened the workers' 30-minute meal break to 20 minutes without consulting the production management committee, the trade union, or obtaining government approval. Workers often have to put down their bowls and get back to work before they've finished eating. Workers are very dissatisfied with this. Some people reflected, "The instructions from the Textile Administration do not call for overtime. We don't know why it's being added again. Are they afraid of not completing the task? We don't even know how many tasks are left to be completed. We just work blindly!"

The overtime phenomenon is even more serious at the Vehicle Factory of the Northeast Forest Industry Bureau. The riveters in the factory's riveting department worked three and a half hours of overtime every day for seven consecutive days. Workers Wang Bingkui, Wang Weitang, and others in the fitter and mechanical departments worked a full day on February 21st and then worked overtime until 3 a.m., and still wanted to go to work as usual when dawn broke. The workers' enthusiasm for production is commendable, but the leadership has not taken care of the workers' health, persuaded them, or appropriately stopped this phenomenon. Instead, they use this as an excuse to call on other workers to also work overtime. On March 19th, the Enterprise Company Distillery forced workers to work five hours of overtime without government approval or consultation with the trade union.

The above situations seriously violate the government's labor policies and laws, endanger the health of the workers, and will make our patriotic production competition unsustainable. It should urgently attract the attention of relevant departments.

### 生产竞赛不是加班加点  佳木斯市某些工厂应扭转突击偏向

　　生产竞赛不是加班加点
    佳木斯市某些工厂应扭转突击偏向编辑同志：
    佳木斯市各工厂自展开爱国主义生产竞赛以来，在全市工人阶级的努力下，已经获得了显著成绩。但由于某些企业领导干部对生产竞赛缺乏正确的认识，存在着单纯完成任务观点，因此，在竞赛中发生了严重的加班加点现象。
    佳木斯纺织厂织布、浆纱、拉条等车间，自二月十五日发动竞赛以来，因卫生设备差、活儿紧，工友吃不好饭、睡不好觉，闹病的很多。据该厂卫生所统计：一月份职工生病率占全厂职工百分之三十三点八，二月份上升至百分之三十六。最严重的时候，织布车间乙班一百二十九人中一天就病倒十六人，因而严重地影响了生产任务的完成。但该厂领导干部不从改善工作方法，调整劳动组织，减少职工的疾病着手，反而不经生产管理委员会研究、工会的同意和政府的批准，竟把工友三十分钟的吃饭时间缩短到二十分钟。工友们时常没有吃完饭就得放下饭碗干活。工友们对此非常不满。有的人反映说：“纺织管理局的指示不叫加班加点，我们也不知道为什么又加起来了。怕完不成任务？我们也不知道还有多少任务没完成，稀里糊涂的干吧！”
    东北森林工业总局车辆工厂加班加点的现象更为严重。该厂铆工部每天加点三小时半，连续加了七天。钳工部、机械部工友王炳奎、王维堂等在二月二十一日整整干了一天活，夜间又加班到午夜三点钟，天亮了还自动要照常上班。工友这种积极生产的热情是可贵的，但领导上却没有照顾工人健康，向工友进行说服教育，适当制止这种现象，反借此号召别的工友也加班加点。企业公司制酒厂三月十九日强要工友加点五小时，不经政府批准，也没和工会商量。
    以上这些情形，都严重地违犯政府的劳动政策法令，危害工人身体的健康，也将使我们的爱国主义生产竞赛不能持久下去。亟应引起有关部门的注意。
