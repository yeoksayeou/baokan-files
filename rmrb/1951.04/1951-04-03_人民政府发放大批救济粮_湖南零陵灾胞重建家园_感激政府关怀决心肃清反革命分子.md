The People's Government Distributes Large Quantities of Relief Grain
Lingling Disaster-Stricken People in Hunan Rebuild Homes
Express Gratitude for Government's Concern, Determined to Eliminate Counter-Revolutionary Elements

After Lingling County, Hunan Province, suffered a fire disaster caused by Kuomintang secret agents, the local government and people immediately provided temporary relief to the disaster victims. Recently, the government distributed a large amount of relief grain, enabling the disaster victims to rebuild their houses and quickly resume production and business.

In addition to the 200,000 jin of rice allocated by the provincial government, the special district and county local grain departments allocated another 500,000 jin, which were distributed to the families of military personnel, cadres, the poor, small handicraft workers, industrial and commercial households, and employees of the provincial hospital who were affected by the disaster. The distribution of relief grain was carried out through democratic discussions at disaster victim conferences and small group meetings. The poor generally received 500 jin of grain. Some also received some disaster relief loans. Small handicraft households such as weaving, iron shops, and flour mills received more than 1,000 jin of grain (part relief grain and part loan grain), solving the difficulties of building houses and resuming production. The forty-four affected merchants also received loans of 220 million yuan from the bank, enabling them to quickly resume business.

After receiving the grain and money, the disaster victims were busy buying bricks, tiles, wood, and fir bark, and began to build new houses and sheds on the ruins burned by the fire. Some purchased production equipment and drew up plans for building houses, production, and business. For example, Li Zhongliang, a weaving worker on Qianjin Street, received 800 jin of relief grain and 600 jin of loan grain. He planned to build three houses, buy a weaving machine, and a spinning machine, and wrote in his plan: (1) Work hard to produce; (2) Be diligent and thrifty; (3) Support the People's Government. After receiving grain and money, the disaster victims of five groups in Jiefang North Road launched a competition for building houses, production, and business recovery.

In the recovery work, the disaster victims united and helped each other, and realized the significance of government relief. Peng Zhiqing of the 15th group of Qianjin Street was originally assessed to receive 800 jin of relief grain, but after one day, he voluntarily requested only 300 jin, and offered to give the excess to other poor households.

The disaster victims were very moved by the government's relief and concern. Each group and each residents' committee competed to write letters to Wang Shoudao, chairman of the Provincial People's Government, expressing their gratitude to the government. When the Provincial People's Government comfort delegation left, they also held a symposium, unanimously expressing their determination to resolutely eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, put forward the slogan "Turn grief into strength," and guaranteed to rebuild houses, quickly restore production and business, and strengthen the effort to resist America and aid Korea.

　　人民政府发放大批救济粮        
    湖南零陵灾胞重建家园   
    感激政府关怀决心肃清反革命分子
    湖南省零陵县城区遭受国民党特务纵火灾害后，当地政府和人民马上向灾胞进行临时救济，最近政府又发放了大批救济粮，使灾胞能重新建设房屋，很快地恢复生产和营业。
    这次救济粮，除省政府拨下的大米二十万斤外，专区、县地方粮又拨出五十万斤，分别发给受灾的军人家属、干部家属、贫民、小手工业者、工商户以及省立医院的员工。发放救济粮，是经过灾民大会及小组会的民主评议，贫民一般都得到了五百斤粮食。有的还领到了一部分救灾贷粮，如织布、铁铺、磨面等小手工业户，都得到了千斤以上的粮食（一部分救济粮和一部分贷粮），解决了盖房子和恢复生产的困难。受灾的四十四户商家也得到了银行二亿二千万元的贷款，使他们能迅速恢复营业。
    灾胞得到粮款后，忙着买砖瓦、木材、杉皮，在被烈火烧过的废墟上开始搭起了新的房屋和棚子；有的购买生产器具，订出了建房、生产和营业的计划。如前进街织布工人李忠良领到救济粮八百斤和贷粮六百斤后，便计划建房子三间，买织布机一架，打纱车一架，并在计划书上写着：（一）努力生产；（二）勤劳节约；（三）拥护人民政府。解放北路五个组的灾民领到粮款后，展开了一个建房、生产、复业的竞赛。
    灾民在恢复工作中，团结互助，认识到了政府救济的意义。前进街十五组彭芷卿，原来评给他八百斤救济粮，过了一天，他便自动要求只要三百斤，把多余的拿出来救济其他贫苦户。
    灾胞们对政府的救济与关怀都非常感动。各组和各居民委员会都争着写信给该省人民政府王首道主席，表示对政府的感激；当省人民政府慰问团离开时，还开了一个座谈会，一致表示要坚决肃清反革命分子，提出了“化悲愤为力量”的口号，保证重新建立起房屋，迅速恢复生产和营业，加强抗美援朝的力量。（附图片）
