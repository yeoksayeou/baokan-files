Emphasize the Work of Supplementing Old Farm Tools
    Sun Jinglu
    The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government convened a farm tool work conference in January and decided on this year's farm tool work policy, which is to focus on supplementing old-fashioned farm tools while also focusing on demonstrating and promoting new-style farm tools. This policy is entirely correct.

    After the National Farm Tool Work Conference, various regions have generally deployed this work. Especially in areas where land reform has just been completed this year, farmers have a very urgent need for farm tools, and this work has been carried out relatively quickly. For example, the Xiangxi Administrative Office mobilized trade companies in various places to actively contact county and district governments and farmers' associations to investigate the number, types, and styles of farm tools lacking by farmers. It was determined that Xiangxi needs to add sixteen types of farm tools this year, totaling 1,249,900 pieces. Then, contracts were signed with blacksmith furnaces in various places, and they were given assistance with raw materials and loans to vigorously meet the farmers' needs for farm tools. For example, the Jinhua Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhejiang Province conducted a survey of 7,020 members in rural areas such as Xietang and Xiaoshun and found that a total of 1,780 plowshares, 250 plow beams, 1,580 dan and 12 liang of raw iron, and 686 jin of steel needed to be added. The cooperative immediately held a forum with private farm tool boiler factories to encourage more production of farm tools and provided assistance in raw material procurement and finished product sales, so that this year's farm tool production increased by 50% compared to 1950.

    Why should we emphasize the work of supplementing old farm tools? This is mainly based on solving the current urgent needs of farmers. After a long period of feudal exploitation and enemy and puppet destruction in rural areas across the country, the lack of farm tools is very serious. On the other hand, this year's task of increasing agricultural and forestry production is very important, and farmers urgently need farm tools, but at present, our country's industrial production conditions are still very poor, so we cannot temporarily meet the requirements of the vast number of farmers with a large number of new-style farm tools, so we can only strive to supplement old-style farm tools.

    However, at present, the relevant departments in some areas have not paid due attention to supplementing old farm tools. Some think that supplementing old-style farm tools is too trivial, and someone will do it anyway; some use all the farm tool loans to purchase new-style farm tools, so that the problem of lack of farm tools cannot be solved. These ideas have hindered the work of supplementing farm tools and should attract our attention.

    According to incomplete reports from various regions to the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, we will rely on loans to supplement 4 million old-style farm tools this year. However, if various regions can implement the spirit of the farm tool work conference, combine local cooperatives, trade companies, and native product companies, and organize rural idle funds, then the task of supplementing old farm tools can be increased by one to two times. Therefore, our overall goal this year is to strive to complete the supplementation of more than 10 million old farm tools. In old areas with a good foundation, we should organize urban and rural exchanges, widely use mass funds, and supplement more production tools, requiring that farm tools are generally sufficient. In areas where land reform has just been completed, necessary supplements should be implemented according to the different conditions of each region. In areas where land reform has not yet been carried out, attention should be paid to protecting farm tools and preventing landlords from destroying them. In addition, this problem should also be solved in a planned and step-by-step manner for disaster areas and areas with a large shortage of farm tools. If we can do the above points, we can pave the way for the future promotion of new farm tools.

    In the current work of supplementing old farm tools, we must pay attention to solving the following problems.

    First, governments at all levels must strengthen their leadership over the work of supplementing old farm tools, implement special personnel responsible for special tasks and special funds for special purposes, organize repair teams, mobilize the masses and assist the masses in carrying out work.

    Second, local cooperatives, trade companies, and native product companies should actively contact county and district governments and farmers' associations to study specific methods for supplementing farm tools, mobilize and organize blacksmiths and carpenters to go to the countryside to carry out farm tool supplementation work, and provide loan assistance when necessary.

    Third, local banks should contact cooperatives, trade companies, and native product companies, carry out credit loan work in a planned and focused manner, absorb a large amount of rural idle funds, try their best to solve the difficulties of mass funds and lack of raw materials, and at the same time, under the principle of "urban and rural exchanges," sign agency sales and advance purchase on credit contracts with farm tool manufacturing industries to do a good job in the production and sales of farm tools.

    Fourth, local trade companies and native product companies should establish business relationships with cooperatives and stipulate a certain price, through contract procedures, so that farmers can exchange native products for farm tools.

    Fifth, working cadres in various districts and townships should pay attention to cultivating a large number of labor models for producing farm tools in conjunction with the patriotic production competition movement, and give rewards and commendations to labor models who actively supplement farm tools.

    In order to do this work well, we must conduct investigations and research to understand the types, quantities, usage habits, and specifications of farm tools needed by local farmers, and then formulate a unified production plan based on the production capacity of local public and private blacksmith and carpentry shops, so that supply and demand can correspond and production and sales can be balanced. In the use of loans, it should be invested in the most important areas and the most needed farm tools in a timely and effective manner. Only in this way can tens of thousands of farmers get the necessary farm tools, restore and improve rural productivity, and complete the task of agricultural bumper harvests.

### 重视旧农具增补工作

　　重视旧农具增补工作
    孙景鲁
    中央农业部一月间召开了农具工作会议，决定了今年农具工作方针，以增补旧式农具为主，同时重点示范推广新式农具。这个方针是完全正确的。
    全国农具工作会议后，各地区一般地都已将这项工作布置下去。特别是今年新完成土地改革的地区，农民对农具的需要非常迫切，这一工作也就开展得比较迅速。如湘西行署发动各地贸易公司主动联系各县、区政府和农会，调查农民缺乏农具数量、种类、式样，确定湘西今年需要添置的农具有十六种，共一、二四九、九○○件，接着即与各地铁匠炉订立合同，并予以原料及贷款的帮助，大力满足农民对农具的需要。又如浙江金华专区供销合作总社，在鞋塘、孝顺等农村七○二○个社员中进行调查，发现共须增补犁头一七八○件，犁臂二五○件，原料毛铁一五八担十二两，钢六八六斤。该社当即与各私营农具锅炉厂举行座谈会，鼓励多生产农具，并在原料采购成品推销等方面给以帮助，使今年的农具生产量比一九五○年增加了百分之五十。
    为什么我们要重视旧农具增补工作呢？这主要是从解决农民当前的迫切需要出发。全国各地农村经过长期的封建剥削和敌伪的摧残，缺乏农具的情况非常严重，另一方面今年农林增产的任务非常重大，农民需要农具非常迫切，但目前我们国家工业生产条件还很差，所以暂时不能以大量的新式农具满足广大农民要求，因而只能努力增补旧式农具。
    但是目前有些地区的有关部门对增补旧农具还未予以应有的重视，有的认为增补旧式农具太琐碎了，反正下面有人搞；有的把农具贷款全部用在购买新式农具上面，以致不能解决缺乏农具问题。这些思想都使农具增补工作受到阻碍，应该引起我们注意。
    根据目前各地区给中央人民政府农业部的不完整的汇报，我们今年依靠贷款增补旧式农具，为数达四百万件。但各地如能贯彻农具工作会议精神，结合各地合作社、贸易公司、土产公司，并组织农村游资，那么增补旧农具的任务，还可增加一到二倍。因此我们今年总的目标，要争取完成增补旧农具一千万件以上。在基础较好的老区，我们应该组织城乡交流，广泛运用群众资金，增补更多的生产工具，要求一般作到农具够用。在刚完成土地改革的地区，应根据各地区不同情况，实行必要的增补。对于尚未进行土地改革地区，应注意保护农具，防止地主破坏。此外，对于灾区和缺乏农具较多的地区，亦应有计划地有步骤地解决这一问题。我们如能作到以上几点，便能给今后推广新农具工作铺平道路。
    在目前开展增补旧农具工作中，我们必须注意解决以下几个问题。
    首先，各级政府要加强对旧农具增补工作的领导，实行专人专责和专款专用，组织检修队，发动群众并协助群众开展工作。
    第二，各地合作社、贸易公司、土产公司应主动地与县区政府和农会联系，研究增补农具的具体办法，发动和组织铁木匠下乡，进行农具增补工作，必要时应给以贷款扶助。
    第三，各地银行应与合作社、贸易公司、土产公司联系，有计划有重点地开展信用贷款工作，大量吸收农村游资，尽力解决群众资金与原料缺乏等困难，同时在“城乡交流”的原则下，与农具制造业订立代销及预购赊购合同，作好农具的产销工作。
    第四、各地贸易公司、土产公司应与合作社建立业务关系，规定一定价格，通过合同手续，使农民可以用土产交换农具。
    第五、各区乡工作干部应结合爱国生产竞赛运动，注意培养大量生产农具的劳动模范，对积极增补农具的劳动模范，并予以奖励和表扬。
    为了做好这件工作，我们必须进行调查研究，了解当地农民需要农具的种类、数量、使用习惯和农具规格，再根据当地公私营铁木匠铺的生产能力，作出统一的生产计划，然后才能作到供求相应，产销平衡。对贷款的运用上，要及时有效地投到最重要的地区，最需要的农具上去。这样才能使成千成万的农民，得到必需的农具，才能够恢复和提高农村的生产力，完成农业丰产的任务。
