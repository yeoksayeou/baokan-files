　　U.S. Aggression Policy, No Matter Who Executes It
　  Will Only End in Shameful Failure
　  Soviet Literary Gazette Comments on MacArthur's Dismissal
    【Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th】The Literary Gazette commented on the Korean situation on the 12th, saying: MacArthur's adventure in the Far East led to his shameful end. Now, just when the failure of Wall Street's Far East policy is particularly obvious, Truman decided to relieve this repeatedly beaten and discredited general of his duties. However, the huge losses of the American invaders in Korea and the repeated failures on the front lines show that boasting about MacArthur's "strategic genius" is completely useless, and that he is incapable of dealing with the Korean situation. Replacing MacArthur is Ridgway. Wall Street is not prepared to abandon its adventurous policy. Therefore, the White House explained that MacArthur's dismissal "does not mean any change in America's policy in the Far East." However, the replacement of the commander-in-chief of the U.S. forces in the Far East is a definite proof of the disarray in the camp of American war instigators. Although the invaders are finding scapegoats for their failures, the aggression policy, no matter who executes it, whether it is MacArthur or his successor Ridgway, will only end in shameful failure.

　  苏联文学报评麦克阿瑟下台
    【新华社莫斯科十四日电】文学报十二日评朝鲜局势说：麦克阿瑟在远东的冒险，使他遭到了可耻的下场。现在正当华尔街远东政策的失败特别明显的时候，杜鲁门决定解除这个屡次挨打和声名狼藉的将军的职务。然而，美国侵占者在朝鲜的巨大损失以及在前线的屡次失败，表明了吹嘘麦克阿瑟的“战略天才”是完全无用的，表明了他无能对付朝鲜的局势。代替麦克阿瑟的是李奇微。华尔街并不准备放弃其冒险政策。所以白宫说明麦克阿瑟的撤职“并不意味美国在远东的政策有任何变更”。然而，撤换美军远东总司令，是美国战争挑拨者阵营狼狈的确切的证明。侵略者虽然给自己的失败找替死鬼，但侵略政策不管由谁执行，麦克阿瑟也好，他的接替人李奇微也好，最后都只能可耻地失败。
