Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editor:

Since you published my letter exposing the manager of Lingling First Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Hunan, Li Xin, for oppressing workers in the People's Daily on February 20th, the Lingling County Federation of Trade Unions immediately mobilized the factory's workers to collect evidence of Li Xin's beatings, scolding, deception, enticement, and division of workers. On March 3rd, they filed a complaint with the county court. When Li Xin learned that the workers were going to sue him, he not only did not sincerely admit his mistakes to the workers but also threatened them, saying, "The factory director is from the North and doesn't understand production technology. If I am detained, the factory will collapse, and all the workers will lose their jobs. Those who file the lawsuit will be responsible." On the other hand, he put on a pitiful appearance and cried to the workers, "Don't sue me; I'll go to jail myself." He approached the mother of worker Zhou Zuchang, said nice things, and tricked Zhou's mother into kneeling before Zhou Zuchang, begging him not to sue Li Xin. On March 27th, after Tang Yu'an, the factory's representative attending the Hunan Provincial Labor Model Representative Conference, returned to the factory, Li Xin even asked Tang Yu'an to go to the County Federation of Trade Unions to plead for him, which Tang Yu'an refused on the spot. Li Xin attempted to use these shameless methods to threaten and soften the workers, but the workers were not fooled. Everyone resolutely said, "You oppressed us too harshly in the past. Crying now is useless."

On March 28th, the county court had already detained Li Xin. The factory workers were very happy. Wu Xiaomao, a worker who had been beaten by Li Xin, said, "I wasn't very relieved before, but now the stone in my heart has truly been lifted." Xia Fumin, a dyehouse worker, said, "In the past, the Kuomintang sided with Li Xin, and workers who opposed him would be arrested. Now the world has been turned upside down, and the People's Government is siding with the workers." After the stone that had been pressing on the workers for a long time was removed, the workers' enthusiasm for production also increased. Currently, the factory's trade union is preparing to formulate a production competition plan.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    零陵第一染织厂经理欺压工人事件已依法处理编辑同志：
    自从你们把我揭露湖南零陵第一染织厂经理李鑫欺压工人的信在二月二十日的人民日报上刊登以后，零陵县总工会即发动该厂工人搜集李鑫打骂、欺骗、拉拢、分化工人的材料，于三月三日向县法院提出控诉。李鑫知道工人要控告他时，不但不诚恳向工人承认错误，反而威胁工人说：“厂长是北方人，不懂得生产技术，如果我被扣押，工厂就会垮台，工人都要失业，告状的人要负责任”。另一方面他又装出一副可怜相，对工人哭着说：“你们不要去告状了，我自己要去坐牢。”他找到工人周祖昌的母亲说好话，骗得周母向周祖昌下跪，要他不要去告李鑫。三月二十七日，该厂出席湖南省劳动模范代表会代表唐玉安回厂后，李鑫又要唐玉安到县总工会去替他说情，当场被唐玉安拒绝了。李鑫就企图以这些无耻手段来威胁软化工人，但工人并不受骗，大家一致坚决地说：“你过去欺压我们太狠了，现在哭也没有用。”
    三月二十八日，县法院已将李鑫扣押起来。该厂工人非常高兴。挨过李鑫打的工人伍小毛说：“先前我还不大放心，现在心上的石头真正放下了。”染房工人夏福民说：“过去国民党给李鑫作主，工人反对他，就会被押起来。现在翻了个天，人民政府给工人作主了。”长期压在工人身上的石头搬掉后，工人的生产劲头也提高了，现该厂工会正在酝酿订立生产竞赛计划。
