　　US Instigates Philippine Reactionary Government to Illegally Arrest Large Numbers of Overseas Chinese

　　[Xinhua News Agency, 9th] Under the instigation of US imperialism, the Philippine Quirino reactionary government continues to illegally arrest large numbers of our overseas Chinese compatriots. According to a Manila dispatch from the Associated Press on the 6th, since the 2nd, the Philippine army and police have successively arrested 93 of our overseas Chinese compatriots, including the female principal of the Hong Kong Primary School of the Manila Chinese School and one of the school's teachers. Fifty-four of the arrested overseas Chinese have been unreasonably detained by the Philippine Ministry of National Defense in the Muntinglupa concentration camp. The Philippine Ministry of National Defense has threatened to arrest more overseas Chinese and stated that it will send most of the arrested to Taiwan to be persecuted by the Kuomintang remnants.
