　　(II) Beware of Special Agents Spreading Poison
　　According to a report from the Yuci District Committee of Shanxi Province on February 21st: "In a cadre training class in Shouyang County, a poisoning incident occurred during the noon meal of noodles on the 15th. All 520 people were divided into three kitchens, of which 414 people from two kitchens were poisoned, with 293 experiencing dizziness, vomiting, stomach pain, shivering, and sweating. The most serious cases involved three individuals, including two who vomited blood. After emergency treatment, all but nine people were safe. The noodle vendor was immediately arrested and interrogated."
　　The lessons of this incident should be taken seriously by all localities. At a time when the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is gradually deepening, all troops, organs, and schools should conduct anti-espionage and security education for all personnel to raise awareness of sabotage and assassination by counter-revolutionary elements. Strengthen anti-espionage, security, and safety inspection work. Strengthen organization and establish strict living management systems. All sabotage incidents must be strictly investigated to determine responsibility and dealt with seriously.

　　（二）警惕特务放毒
    据山西榆次地委二月二十一日通报称：“寿阳县某干部训练班，于十五日午饭吃面时，发生中毒事件。全体五百二十人分立三灶，其中两灶共四百一十四人中，有二百九十三人中毒，头晕、呕吐、肚痛、发抖、出汗，最严重者三人，其中吐血者二人。经急救后，除九人外，余均获安全，事后立即逮捕了卖面商人进行审讯。”
    这一事件的教训，各地应引起严重注意。在目前镇压反革命运动逐步深入的时候，所有部队机关学校均应对一切人员进行防奸保密教育，提高对反革命分子破坏暗杀的警惕性。加强防奸、保密、安全检查工作。严密组织，建立严密的生活管理制度。对一切破坏事件，必须严格检查追究责任，认真处理。
