　　Guisui Public Security Bureau Accepts Public Demand
    Arrests Imperialist Element Ge Weide
    The Public Security Bureau of the Guisui Municipal People's Government, accepting the accusations and demands of all faculty and staff (all of whom are religious believers) of Shengxing Elementary School (a Catholic school, now renamed Fifteenth Complete Elementary School), arrested Ge Weide (a Belgian national), an American imperialist spy who was carrying out counter-revolutionary activities under the guise of Catholicism, on March 20th.

　　During the Japanese occupation, Ge Weide colluded with the Japanese invaders, wearing the cloak of a "missionary," actively conducting pro-Japanese propaganda in Wuchuan, everywhere slandering the Eighth Route Army, and enticing Ji Puful, the head of the 13th Regiment of the 19th District Self-Defense Army, who was still resisting Japan at the time, to betray the country and surrender to the Japanese invaders. In 1941, Ge Weide also supplied ten large rifles from the church to the puppet Wuhe Township Baojia Regiment, which was entrenched in the Sanyuanjing area, to slaughter the local anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians. In August 1945, Ge Weide went to the Xintang Catholic Church in Liangcheng as "priest" and colluded with the traitor priest Wang Zaihao (during the Japanese occupation, Wang served as an administrative member of the puppet county government, head of the pacification team, and head of the reception section, and openly set up a radio station to directly contact the Japanese intelligence agency in Datong. After the Kuomintang bandit army first seized Xintang after the surrender of the Japanese invaders, Wang also served as the chief of staff of the anti-communist self-defense regiment), continuing to carry out anti-communist and anti-people activities. When Xintang was first liberated on August 29, 1945, a large number of military supplies and enemy puppet materials were hidden in the church. At that time, our army raised this matter and guaranteed that as long as they were handed over in full, the church and individuals would not be violated. Ge Weide and the traitor Wang Zaihao repeatedly quibbled and refused to admit it. After two inspections, a total of seventeen Mauser rifles, two Czech submachine guns, one No. 304 and one Gun Brand pistol, thirty grenades, one landmine, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, a seal of the puppet Liangcheng County Government, and a large number of enemy puppet materials were found in the church. In April 1946, 1,247 rounds of rifle ammunition, one mortar shell, 49 grenades, eight Japanese bayonets, one pair of handcuffs, six sets of military uniforms, and a radio station were found in the courtyard where Ge committed the crime. In August of the same year, when local peasant believers legally carried out rent reduction to the Catholic Church, and asked him to hand over the guns, Ge Weide not only quibbled in every possible way, but also threatened everyone, saying: "What if you can't find them?" Until the masses put one No. 3 pistol, eleven bullets, five Mauser rifles (found in the old church), and sixty-four secret documents from the puppet Liangcheng Police Section in front of him, he admitted his mistake to the government and the masses when he saw that he could not deny it, signed a pledge, and stated in the Suimeng Daily at that time: "I am not honest with the government and do not respect it" (the original statement was published in the Suimeng Daily on August 15, 1946). At that time, our government was generous and only fined Ge a sum of money to settle the matter.

　　After our army took the initiative to withdraw from Liangcheng, Ge committed the crime even more rampantly, colluding with the Kuomintang reactionary government and evil landlords to carry out crazy reckoning against the peasant believers. Once, he locked up more than 300 peasant believers in the church's kitchen for two days without giving them food, and personally tortured them. Wang Gensheng, Li Yuhuan, Liu Er, Dong Liang, Wang Shuwawa, Xing Shulin, and others were forced to give Ge six cows. Peasant Wang Er was so afraid that he fled while ill, but was captured by Ge's henchmen and sent to the reactionary government. Soon, Wang Er died. In the end, Ge Weide also hung up Wang Er's wife and eldest son and beat them severely, almost to death. Wang Qianhuan from Nanjie, Xintang, was allocated five dou of naked oats during the rent reduction, but Ge insisted on two dan, and as a result, Wang was forced to hang himself. Ge confiscated all the property of Li Sanxiao's family in the old church, and threatened him with a bayonet, causing Li Sanxiao to die of illness soon after. According to preliminary statistics, Ge plundered more than 2,000 shi of grain, more than 100 livestock, and countless cloths and clothing from the peasants during the "reckoning".

　　In the Liangcheng Church, Ge Weide, in the position of "priest", also abused and killed a large number of Chinese children; and used religious privileges to seduce Chinese female believers. The children in the Xintang "Infant Home" were not well nourished and were only cared for by disabled people. Many of them were tortured to death, and some were sold by Ge Weide (three shi of naked oats for one child). Ge hired people to send out corpses of infants by the load. The people of Liangcheng called the "Infant Home" the Palace of the King of Hell.

　　After our army liberated Liangcheng in 1948, Ge Weide fled to Guisui and served as "Director Priest" in the Xincheng Catholic Church and chairman of the board of directors of Shengxing Elementary School. He colluded with imperialist spies such as Bai Xiang to organize a counter-revolutionary "underground army" to carry out sabotage after liberation. After the liberation of the entire Suiyuan, Ge actively carried out counter-revolutionary activities such as spreading rumors to confuse the public, undermining our various tasks, spying on our organs, and collecting intelligence. In March of last year, Ge spread rumors that "World War III will break out in May." When Guisui City schools began to establish the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers, Ge threatened religious students in various schools, saying: "Anyone who wants to join the Chinese New Democratic Youth League or the Young Pioneers will be expelled from the church." When many religious youths in Guisui City volunteered to join the war to resist the United States and aid Korea last fall, Ge carried out sabotage in many ways, saying to the religious youths who had already signed up: "You should pretend to be sick or ask for leave and not go, and if that doesn't work, find a way to escape on the road. No matter where you run to in the church, as long as you mention me, Ge Weide, you can get along." In June of last year, Ge criticized some of the religious believers who had been deceived and used by him for providing too little information about the outside world, and ordered them to collect more intelligence for him in the future. Ge had separately wooed policemen from the Fifth Branch of the Guisui City Public Security Bureau and staff members from the Guisui City Post Office to spy on our situation. On October 29th of last year, Ge secretly discussed the issue of organizing reactionary armed forces in the church with the special agent Liu Meihu, who was active in the Wudong Wuhe Township area.

　　Ge Weide single-handedly controlled the education and economic sovereignty of Shengxing Elementary School, and no one else could interfere. He often insulted and beat faculty and staff and students, and some students were even beaten unconscious.

　　Since this spring, all faculty and staff of the school have gradually realized that Ge Weide is an American imperialist spy, and in February, they jointly wrote a written accusation demanding that the government arrest and punish Ge according to the law.

　　归绥公安局接受群众要求
    逮捕帝国主义分子葛维德
    归绥市人民政府公安局接受盛兴小学（天主教学校，现改为十五完全小学）全体教职员（均系教徒）的控诉和要求，在三月二十日逮捕了以天主教为掩护进行反革命活动的美帝国主义间谍分子葛维德（比籍）。
    日寇侵占期间，葛维德就已经和日寇勾结，披着“传教士”的外衣，在武川积极进行亲日宣传，到处污蔑八路军，并勾引当时尚在抗日的十九区自卫军十三团团长吉普福，率部叛变，投降了日寇。一九四一年葛维德又将教堂内的十支大枪，供给盘据三元井一带之伪五合乡保甲团，以屠杀当地的抗日军民。一九四五年八月，葛维德到凉城新堂天主堂任“司铎”，与该堂汉奸神甫王在镐（日寇统治时期王逆当过伪县公署行政委员、宣抚班长、招待股长，并公开架设无线电台，直接与大同日本特务机关联系。日寇投降，国民党匪军第一次窃据新堂后，王逆又当了防共自卫团参谋长）狼狈为奸，继续进行反共反人民的活动。一九四五年八月二十九日新堂获得第一次解放时，教堂内隐藏了大批军用品及敌伪物资，当时我军提出此事，并保证：只要如数交出，绝不侵犯教堂及个人。葛维德和汉奸王在镐一再狡赖，死不承认。后经两次检查，共从堂内搜出老毛瑟大枪十七支，捷克式马枪两支，三○四号及枪牌手枪各一支，手榴弹三十颗，地雷一颗，子弹一千多发，伪凉城县公署关防一颗和不少敌伪物资。一九四六年四月，又从葛犯住的院内查出步枪子弹一千二百四十七发，迫击炮弹一颗，手榴弹四十九颗，日本刺刀八把，手铐一付及军服六件，和无线电台一部。同年八月，当地农民教徒依法向天主堂进行减租时，叫他交出枪支，葛维德不但百般狡赖，还威胁大家说：“搜不出来怎办？”直至群众将三号手枪一支，子弹十一粒，老毛瑟大枪五支（旧堂搜出来的）及伪凉城警务科秘密文件六十四份，都放在面前，他看见抵赖不过，才向政府及群众承认错误，签字具结，并在当时的绥蒙日报上声明：“对政府不老实，不尊重”（原声明载一九四六年八月十五日绥蒙日报）。当时我政府宽大为怀，仅处葛犯以一部罚金，了结此事。
    我军主动撤出凉城后，葛犯更变本加厉，勾结国民党反动政府及恶霸地主向农民教徒进行疯狂的倒算。有一次他把三百多农民教徒关在教堂大伙房内两天不给吃饭，并亲自拷打。王根生、李玉环、刘二、董良、王树娃、邢树林等六人，曾被迫交给葛犯六条牛。农民王二怕得带病逃走，又被葛犯派爪牙抓回来，送到反动政府。不久，王二就死了。最后，葛维德还把王二的老婆和长子吊起毒打，几乎打死。新堂南街王钱换，在减租中分了五斗莜麦，葛犯非要两石不成，结果王被迫上吊自杀。葛犯将旧堂李三小的家产全部没收，并以刺刀威吓，使李三小不久得病身亡。据初步统计，葛犯在“倒算”中共掠夺了农民的粮食两千多石，牲畜一百余头，及布匹、衣物等无数。
    葛维德在凉城教堂内，以“司铎”地位，还虐待死了大批中国儿童；利用宗教特权诱奸中国女教徒。新堂“婴儿院”里的孩子们，因为得不到好营养，只叫残废人看管，好多被折磨死，有的是被葛维德卖了（一个孩子三石莜麦）。葛犯曾雇人成担地往外送婴儿尸体。凉城群众叫“婴儿院”是阎王殿。
    一九四八年我军解放凉城后，葛维德逃来归绥，在新城天主堂任“主任司铎”，兼盛兴小学董事会的董事长。他勾结了特务白祥等帝国主义间谍分子组织反革命“地下军”，准备在解放后进行破坏。绥远全境解放后，葛犯积极进行造谣惑众、破坏我各种工作、刺探我机关情况、搜集情报等反革命活动。去年三月间，葛犯曾散布“三次世界大战在五月爆发”等谣言。归绥市各学校开始建立青年团和少年儿童队时，葛犯威胁各学校教徒学生说：“谁要参加中国新民主主义青年团或儿童队，就要开除谁教籍。”去年秋季归绥市不少教徒青年志愿报名赴朝参战时，葛犯从多方进行破坏，对已报名的教徒青年说：“你们应该装病或请假不去，再不成，就在路上想法子逃跑，不管跑到什么地方教堂内，只要一提我葛维德，你就可以吃得开。”去年六月间，葛犯曾指责为其所欺骗利用的一些教徒反映外界情况太少，并命令他们以后多给他搜集情报。葛犯曾分别拉拢归绥市公安五分局警察及归绥市邮局职员，刺探我方情况。去年十月二十九日，葛犯曾与活动于武东武合乡一带的特务刘美虎在堂内秘密商量组织反动武装问题。
    葛维德一手操纵了盛兴小学的教育与经济主权，别人是不能过问的。他经常侮辱打骂教职员和学生，有的学生还被打了晕过去。
    今春以来，全校教职员已逐渐认清了葛维德是美帝国主义间谍分子，在二月份联名写书面控诉，要求政府将葛犯逮捕法办。
