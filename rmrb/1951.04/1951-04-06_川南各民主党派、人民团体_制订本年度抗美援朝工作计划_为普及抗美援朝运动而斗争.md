　　Democratic Parties and People's Organizations in Southern Sichuan
　　Formulate Work Plans for Resisting America and Aiding Korea This Year
　　Striving to Popularize the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement
　　Democratic parties and people's organizations in Southern Sichuan and Luzhou Municipality have successively formulated plans for popularizing and deepening the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement in 1951 and have begun to implement them. Fourteen units, including the Southern Sichuan Branch of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, the Southern Sichuan People's Consultative Committee, the Southern Sichuan Regional Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Southern Sichuan Working Committee of the China Democratic League, have now established plans.

　　The plans of each unit divide the year's Resist America and Aid Korea Movement into three stages for gradual implementation.

　　The first stage, from now until May 1st, is a period of popularizing propaganda and education. Through various mass gatherings, the people of the entire region will establish correct views of despising, hating, and disdaining American imperialism, enhance national self-esteem and self-confidence, and firmly believe in the inevitable victory of opposing aggressive wars. During this period, units that have not yet established patriotic pacts should establish them immediately; those that have established patriotic pacts should check the implementation of the pacts. By May 1st, people from all walks of life will hold large-scale rallies, demonstrations, and parades to push the movement to a climax.

　　The second stage, from May 1st to the National Day celebration on October 1st, is a period of deepening the movement, making patriotic current affairs study regular, and integrating it with various central tasks to gradually deepen the movement. For example, workers should launch patriotic production competitions, organize worker pickets, and prevent special agents from sabotaging production; farmers should accelerate the distribution of land, defeat the remaining feudal forces, eradicate the social foundation for imperialism to carry out aggression in China, and develop agricultural production to support the Chinese People's Volunteers; industrialists and businessmen should do a good job in production and urban-rural material exchange, actively pay taxes, and stabilize prices; students should enhance their patriotic and internationalist thinking and create a new democratic cultural and political learning upsurge; religious circles should further develop the patriotic religious reform movement. Each unit also plans to hold a grand National Day celebration on October 1st to review the combat forces of Resist America and Aid Korea.

　　Starting from the National Day celebration, the movement enters its third stage, which is to consolidate the achievements of the movement, summarize experiences, and prepare to welcome the new tasks of 1952.

　　In order to strengthen the leadership of this movement, the Southern Sichuan Branch of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea has notified all counties, cities, and districts to immediately and universally establish branches and groups to Resist America and Aid Korea and to deeply develop this great patriotic movement.

　　川南各民主党派、人民团体
　  制订本年度抗美援朝工作计划
　  为普及抗美援朝运动而斗争
    川南区及泸州市的各民主党派、各人民团体相继制订一九五一年度普及和深入抗美援朝运动的计划，并已开始着手执行。现已订立计划的，有中国人民抗美援朝总会川南分会、川南各界人民协商委员会、中国共产党川南区党委、中国民主同盟川南区工作委员会等十四个单位。
    各单位的计划都将全年抗美援朝运动分为三个阶段，逐步推行。
    第一阶段，从现在起到“五一”止，为普及宣传教育时期。通过各种群众性的集会，使全区人民树立蔑视、仇视、鄙视美帝国主义的正确观点，提高民族自尊心和自信心，坚定反对侵略战争的必胜信念。在这一时期内，未订立爱国公约的单位应即订立；已订立爱国公约的，应检查公约的执行情况。到“五一”节时，各界人民举行大规模的集会示威游行，将运动推向高潮。
    第二阶段，自“五一”至十月一日国庆纪念日止，为运动的深入时期，使爱国主义时事学习经常化，并结合各项中心工作，使运动逐步深入。例如工人应展开爱国主义生产竞赛，组织工人纠察队，防止特务破坏生产；农民要加速分配土地，打垮残余的封建势力，铲除帝国主义在中国进行侵略的社会基础，并发展农业生产，支援中国人民志愿军；工商界应做好生产和城乡物资交流，踊跃纳税，稳定物价；学生要提高爱国主义和国际主义的思想，造成新民主主义文化和政治学习的热潮；宗教界要进一步开展宗教革新爱国运动。各单位并计划于十月一日举行盛大的国庆纪念会，以检阅抗美援朝的战斗力量。
    从国庆纪念日开始进入运动的第三阶段，即巩固运动成果，总结经验，准备迎接一九五二年的新任务。
    中国人民抗美援朝总会川南分会为加强对这一运动的领导，已通知各县市及各区立即普遍建立抗美援朝支会及小组，深入开展这一伟大的爱国运动。
