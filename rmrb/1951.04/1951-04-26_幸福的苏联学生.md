　　Happy Soviet Students
    Democratic students all over the world take the life and study of Soviet students as their own model and ideal. In the Soviet Union, all people fully enjoy the right to receive education. The Soviet Union has a total of 880 higher education institutions with 1,230,000 students, more than the total number of students in the capitalist countries of Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia combined. 90 percent of the students are from worker and peasant families, and the rest are children of working intellectuals.

    A ten-year compulsory primary and secondary education system has been implemented in most cities and industrial centers of the Soviet Union. Education up to the seventh grade is completely free. Students in higher education institutions who pass the exams (accounting for 92 percent of all students) are eligible to receive state scholarships. In higher education institutions, the ratio of teachers to students is very high, often no less than one to ten. Among the teachers and professors are the most outstanding scholars, world-renowned scientists and artists, and winners of the Stalin Prize. To ensure that students have the most perfect learning environment, the schools have all the necessary equipment. For example, Moscow University has a library with 2.3 million books and 93 branches in various departments and dormitories. The equipment of the Moscow Textile Institute of Technology resembles a factory. The National Lenin Pedagogical Institute regularly has 200 films for teaching purposes.

    The new campus of Moscow University is currently being built on Lenin Hills in Moscow. This new campus will cover an area of 160 hectares. The center of the campus will be a 26-story building, surrounded by 20 buildings. The departments will be located on the periphery of these buildings, and the buildings of each department will be even more magnificent than the current building of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. On that vast lawn, there will be a stadium that can accommodate 25,000 people. In the dormitories, there will be more than 6,000 single rooms for students and graduate students to live in. In addition, there is a large building for extracurricular activity groups and sports associations to carry out mass cultural and sports activities.

    Soviet higher education institutions strive to closely link their scientific activities with the practical work of socialist construction. Many higher technical schools have established particularly close ties with enterprises, providing them with effective scientific and technological assistance and studying production methods. During the holidays, students concretely use the theories they have learned in school to help workers and collective farmers, and participate in educational work in their own residential areas. Student work teams have participated in the reconstruction of Stalingrad and other construction projects.

    Soviet higher education institutions not only arm students with specialized knowledge, but also continuously strengthen students' political and ideological education, arm them with Marxism-Leninism, so that they can become not only pure scientific experts, but also political and social workers, deeply concerned about the fate of their country, familiar with and good at mastering the laws of social development, and strive to become active participants in the country's political leadership.

    A Soviet student receives aesthetic education from his childhood. Soviet children can appreciate and understand music and art very early on. In large cities, such as Moscow, there are four children's cinemas and theaters, which organize special programs for children. The purpose of Soviet higher education is to cultivate new specialized talents with broad knowledge in all aspects. Therefore, in addition to coming into contact with the knowledge of their own field of study, students also regularly listen to lectures on other general sciences or arts, and participate in mass cultural activities organized by various extracurricular activity groups. Every school has its own choir or dance troupe, as well as a club for gatherings and performances. Soviet students widely participate in extracurricular cultural activities. The technical level of the most advanced among them has reached the requirements of professional artists.

    In the Soviet Union, everyone has the opportunity to participate in sports activities. In ordinary schools and specialized schools, millions of Soviet children, teenagers, and young men and women actively and automatically participate in various sports activities in addition to receiving physical training in schools. Soviet sports are the best in the world. Soviet youth and students have repeatedly shown their skills in international competitions.

    The Soviet Communist Party and the government pay close attention to the lives of Soviet students. Every higher education institution has enough dormitories to accommodate boarding students. In Moscow, there is a "Student City" that can accommodate 3,000 students. Students living here only need to pay 18.5 rubles per month to enjoy all the rights of "Student City". In order to renovate this large dormitory, the government allocated 6.2 million rubles in 1950, 1.1 million rubles for furniture, and 200,000 rubles for repairing sports equipment. This dormitory has a well-equipped hospital, sanatorium and sports field. In addition to direct government appropriations, the several price reductions after the war were an important factor in the continuous improvement of the living conditions of Soviet students.

    In the Soviet Union, students have their own trade unions to solve all the problems of students' life and welfare, such as issuing scholarships, providing subsidies and holiday expenses, and establishing sanatoriums. Students, like other people, have the right to free medical treatment. The reduction of diseases among Soviet students is the result of universal sports, excellent living environment and rich nutrition.

    The vast majority of Soviet students are organized in the Lenin Communist Youth League and trade union movement. About 80 percent of the students in Soviet higher education institutions are members of the Communist Youth League. The task of the League in schools is to assist the Party and educational administration in carrying out communist education for students. Communist education is composed of five parts: intellectual education, technical education, moral education, physical education, and aesthetic education. In the process of education, these five parts are closely linked and often realized simultaneously.

    Soviet students regularly receive patriotic and internationalist education. Therefore, they have achieved brilliant achievements in the struggle to consolidate the Soviet regime and the socialist economy, in the struggle to defeat the fascist forces, and in the peaceful and creative labor of building communism today. Soviet young students have always stood at the forefront of peace warriors around the world.

    The happy life and study of Soviet students point out a path to a bright future for students all over the world, and greatly encourage democratic students all over the world to fight for peace, a better life, and democratic education.

　　幸福的苏联学生
    全世界的民主学生都以苏联学生的生活和学习情况作为自己的榜样和理想。在苏联，全国人民都充分地享有接受教育的权利。苏联有高等学校共八八○所，学生一、二三○、○○○人，比欧、亚、非、澳四洲资本主义国家中学生人数的总和还要多。学生的成份，百分之九十是工农出身的，其余的都是劳动知识分子的子弟。
    在苏联的大部分城市和工业中心，已实行了十年的初等和中等强迫教育制度。七年级以下的教育完全免费。高等学校的学生，凡是考试合格的（占全部学生的百分之九十二），都可领取国家的奖学金。在高等教育学校里，教师人数对于学生人数的比例很高，常常不少于一比十。在教员和教授当中，有最卓越的学者、世界著名的科学家和艺术家以及斯大林奖金的获得者。为了保证学生们有最完善的学习环境，学校里有着一切应有的设备。例如莫斯科大学有一间图书馆藏书二百三十万册，并在各院系及宿舍里设立九十三个分馆。莫斯科纺织技术学院的设备俨若一间工厂。国立列宁师范学院经常具备二百部电影片子作教学用途。
    在莫斯科列宁山上现正建设着莫斯科大学的新校园。这座新校园将占有一百六十公顷的面积。校园的中心将耸立起一座二十六层高的大厦，大厦的四周将有二十座房子。各系的系址将座落在这些房子的外围，各系建筑都要比目前苏联部长会议那座房子还宏大。在那广阔的草地上，将有一个可容二万五千人的运动场。在宿舍里，将设有六千多个单人房给学生和研究生居住。此外，还有一座很大的房子，供课余活动团体和体育会进行群众文化活动及体育活动。
    苏联高等学校极力将它们的科学活动与社会主义建设的实际工作密切地联系起来。有许多高等技术学校与一些企业建立了特殊密切的联系，给予它们以有效的科学技术帮助，并研究生产方法。在假期中，学生们把他们在学校里所学得的理论，具体地利用来帮助工人和集体农民，并在他们自己所居住的地方参加教育工作。学生工作队曾参加了重建斯大林格勒的建设等工作。
    苏联高等学校不仅以专门知识来武装学生，并且不断地加强学生的政治思想教育，用马克思列宁主义来武装他们，使他们不仅仅成为单纯的科学专家，而且也要成为政治和社会工作者，深切地关心自己国家的命运，熟悉并善于掌握社会发展的规律，并争取成为国家政治领导的积极参加者。
    一个苏联学生从他幼年起便接受审美教育。苏联儿童很早便能欣赏并了解音乐与艺术。在大城市中，比方说在莫斯科，有四间儿童电影院和剧场，为儿童组织特别的节目。苏联高等教育的目的，是要造就具有各方面广博知识的新的专门人才。因此学生们除了和他们自己所研究的那一门学识接触以外，还经常听取其他普通的科学或艺术的讲演，参加各种课余活动团体所组织的群众文化活动。每一间学校都有它自己的合唱团或舞蹈团，以及一个供集会和表演用的俱乐部。苏联学生十分广泛地参加课余的文化活动。他们当中技术水准最高的，已能达到职业艺术家的要求。
    在苏联，每个人都有参加体育活动的机会。在普通学校和专科学校里，千百万的苏联儿童、少年和青年男女除了接受学校里的体育训练以外，还积极地自动参加各种体育活动。苏联的体育是世界上最优秀的。苏联青年和学生曾经屡次在国际竞赛会上大显身手。
    苏联共产党和政府密切关注苏联的学生的生活。每一所高等教育学校都有足够的宿舍收容寄宿的学生。在莫斯科，有一所可容三千学生的“学生城”，在这里住宿的学生，每月只要交十八·五个卢布，就可以享受“学生城”的一切权利。为了修整这所大宿舍，一九五○年政府曾拨出六百二十万卢布，添设家具费一百一十万卢布，修理运动器具二十万卢布。这个宿舍里有设备完善的医院、疗养院及运动场。除了政府直接的拨款以外，战后的几次减低物价是苏联学生生活条件不断增进的很重要的因素。
    在苏联，学生有自己的工会，解决学生们一切生活福利问题，如发给奖学金、供给补助费和假期的费用、设立疗养院等。学生们像其他的人民一样，都有免费受诊疗的权利。苏联学生疾病的减少，是普遍的体育运动、绝好的生活环境和丰富的营养的结果。
    苏联的学生，绝大部分是在列宁共产主义青年团和工会运动中组织起来的。苏联高等教育学校的学生，约有百分之八十是共青团团员。团在学校中的任务就是帮助党和教育行政对学生进行共产主义教育。共产主义教育是由智育、技术教育、德育、体育、美育五部分构成的。在进行教育的过程中，这五部分是互相紧密地联系着，并且常常同时实现着的。
    苏联学生经常接受爱国主义与国际主义教育。因此他们在巩固苏维埃政权和社会主义经济的斗争中、在打败法西斯势力的斗争中、以及在今天建设共产主义的和平与创造性的劳动中，获得了光辉的成就。苏联青年学生一向站在全世界青年和平战士的最前列。
    苏联学生的幸福生活与学习情况，给全世界学生指出了一条走向光辉的未来的道路，大大地鼓舞着全世界民主学生为争取和平、美好生活与民主教育而斗争。
