The experience of Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Tianjin and other places proves that using shop windows and advertisements for anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda is a very effective method of publicity. Recently, some shops in Beijing, such as Yong'an Writing Brush Shop, Wuzhou Pharmacy, Chunhuatai Porcelain Shop, and Runji Department Store, have also used shop windows or advertisements to draw anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda paintings: some are original creations; some are enlargements of "History of American Aggression Against China" or cartoons from newspapers. Yong'an Writing Brush Shop combines advertisements that link fountain pens to peace signatures, recall the blood debts of the Japanese invasion of China, and current affairs propaganda. Many employees have created very excellent works. In the window of Renli Industrial Company's Beijing Branch, a tapestry woven with maps of China and Korea is hung, with red lines marking the struggle of all parts of China to support Korea against American aggression. Wuzhou Pharmacy hung up cartoons of American imperialism's aggression against China, and now it has built a peace fortress with soap and is preparing to design new window displays. Many other shops have now also begun to post many propaganda paintings in their windows.

Although we have many newspapers, pictorials, and comic strips that publish pictures or photos of anti-American and aid-Korea, and have carried out propaganda and education to the people, there must still be many people who cannot see these books and newspapers. If all the shops with windows in all the cities use their windows to carry out anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda, then we can imagine how many people can be educated in anti-American and aid-Korea. For example, after Yong'an Writing Brush Shop put up current affairs propaganda paintings, there were more than 1,000 viewers on the first day and 2,000 on the second day. There are always fifteen or sixteen people watching the propaganda paintings next to the window of Zhentaixiang Silk and Cloth Shop, and sometimes people watch them at night.

Now, more shops in Beijing are preparing to do window propaganda, which is a very good phenomenon and should be greatly promoted. If this work is done well, then on both sides of every street with shops, there will be many colorful and educational propaganda works displayed, just like a large-scale anti-American and aid-Korea art exhibition, and thousands upon thousands of passers-by every day will become enthusiastic viewers of this exhibition.

Shop assistants and managers across the country, get the window displays going!

　　店员们，经理们，把橱窗宣传搞起来！
　　华君武
    上海、南京、苏州、天津等地的经验证明，利用商店的橱窗、广告作抗美援朝的宣传，是一种非常有效的宣传方法。最近，北京市有些商店，例如永安笔坊，五洲药房，春华泰磁器店，润记百货店等，也已经利用橱窗或广告绘制了抗美援朝的宣传画：有的是自己创作的；有的是用“美国侵华史画”或用报纸上的漫画加以放大的。永安笔坊是以钢笔联系到和平签名、回忆到日寇侵华的血债等等和时事宣传结合的广告画。许多职工创造了非常优秀的作品，仁立实业公司北京分公司的橱窗里，悬挂着一幅织着中国和朝鲜地图的壁毯，用红线标明全中国各地支援朝鲜反对美国侵略的斗争。五洲药房挂起了美帝国主义侵略我国的漫画，现在又用肥皂搭成了和平堡垒，并准备设计新的橱窗。其它许多商店现在也已经开始在橱窗上张贴了许多宣传画。
    我们虽然有许多报纸，画刊，连环画刊登了抗美援朝的图画或照片，向人们进行了宣传和教育，但是，也一定还有很多人不能看到这些书报。如果所有的城市的所有有橱窗的商店都利用他们的橱窗来作抗美援朝的宣传，那么我们可以想像到将有多少人可以受到抗美援朝的教育。举例来说，永安笔坊挂出了时事宣传画以后，第一天就有一千多观众，第二天到了两千人。震泰祥绸布店橱窗旁经常总有十五六个人在看宣传画，有时夜里还有人在看。
    现在，北京已经有更多的商店准备做橱窗宣传，这是一种很好的现象，应该大加提倡。如果这个工作做得好，那么，我们每一条有商店的大街两旁，将有许多五光十色、富有教育意义的宣传作品陈列出来，就像一个规模宏大的抗美援朝美术展览会一样，而每天成千成万的过路行人，就都会变成这个展览会的热心观众。
    全国的店员们，经理们，把橱窗宣传搞起来！
