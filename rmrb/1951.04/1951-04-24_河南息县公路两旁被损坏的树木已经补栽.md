A response to criticisms and suggestions from readers of the People's Daily

    To the Editor:
    After reading Comrade Yang Guangya's criticism in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on February 22 regarding the destruction of trees along the highway in our county, we immediately conducted a thorough investigation. We discovered that trees had been damaged along 25 *li* of the highway from Xixian to Wulongji (from Xiangdian to Fanlou, west of Xiazhuang), totaling approximately 750 old and new trees. Among them, about 70% had their branches cut off, while the rest were uprooted.

    We have reviewed this situation and believe that the destruction of these trees was a result of our relaxation of protection efforts. We have dispatched dedicated personnel to the villages along both sides of the road to mobilize and organize the masses to protect roadside trees and to carry out replanting. According to statistics, 21,000 willow, pagoda tree, and other saplings have now been replanted.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    河南息县公路两旁被损坏的树木已经补栽编辑同志：
    读了二月二十二日人民日报《读者来信》栏杨光亚同志对我县公路树木被破坏的批评后，我们即深入调查，发现由息县至乌龙集公路树木共被破坏二十五华里（由项店起至夏庄西范楼止），计新旧树木七百零五十棵左右，其中有十分之七树枝被砍掉，其余则连根拔去。
    我们对此作了检讨，认为这些树木之所以被破坏，是我们放松保护的结果。我们并派了专人前去该路两旁各村，发动与组织群众保护行道树木，并进行补种。据统计现在已补栽柳槐等树苗二万一千棵。
