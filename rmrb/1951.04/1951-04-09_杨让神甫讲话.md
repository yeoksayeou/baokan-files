Father Yang Rang's Speech

Fellow Priests and Parishioners:

　　I feel very honored to be able to participate in this epoch-making conference of the Tianjin Catholic Church today. In the past three months, the parishioners of the Reformation Promotion Association have overcome all difficulties with a spirit of perseverance and struggle, which has increased the confidence and courage of the patriotic and religious Catholics in the city and enabled our church to embark on the road to prosperity from today onwards. We should thank the enthusiastic support of the citizens and the People's Government, and we should also thank the efforts of the preparatory committee of the Promotion Association. I would like to express my highest respect to all the leaders and members of the preparatory committee with the utmost sincerity.

　　The Promotion Association has been established. This is the result of more than three months of hard work. In order to maintain the purity of the Holy Church and wash away the stigma of imperialism from the Church, we must resolutely implement the Three-Self principle and completely sever ties with imperialism. The anti-imperialist and patriotic movement launched by us Catholics has won the support of the people all over the country. Although the work ahead is still quite arduous, as long as we have confidence, we will definitely overcome the difficulties and move towards a bright future. We, the children of God, should all contribute all our strength today, and together with the people of the whole country, strive and work hard for the construction of a new China.

　　杨让神甫讲话各位神甫教友们：
    今天我能参加我们天津市天主教这一划时代的大会，感到十分荣幸。过去三个月中，革新促进会的教友们以坚苦奋斗的精神，克服了一切困难，给全市爱国爱教的教友增加了胜利的信心与勇气，使我们的教会从今天起走上了兴盛的道路。我们应该感谢全市市民与人民政府的热烈支持，也应该感谢促进会筹备会诸公的努力，个人谨以至诚向各首长及筹备会诸公致以最高的敬礼。
    促进会成立了。这是三月余努力奋斗所得到的果实。为了保持圣教会的纯洁，洗去帝国主义所加于教会的玷辱，我们只有坚决实行三自，彻底斩断与帝国主义的联系。我们天主教徒发动的这一反帝爱国的运动，已经博得全国人民的支援，今后的工作虽然还相当艰巨，但只要我们有信心就一定能克服困难，走向光明大道。我们天主的儿女们，今天都应该贡献出一切力量，与全国人民在一起，为建设新的中国而奋斗而努力。
