　　Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: The inaugural representative conference of the China Peace Committee, North China Region, opened in Beijing on April 22nd. Attending were delegations from Beijing and Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces, as well as the North China Region, totaling eight delegations and including over 150 representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, Hui and Mongolian minority nationalities, business and industry, cultural and educational circles, religious circles, and other sectors.

　　Nie Zhen, chairman of the conference preparatory committee, reported on the preparation process and the significance of the conference. He said that the tasks of this conference are to: summarize the work of the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement in North China in the past; formulate specific tasks for the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in North China in the future; and elect and establish a North China General Sub-Committee of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association to uniformly lead the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement in North China.

　　Subsequently, Guo Moruo, chairman of the China Peace Committee, and Liu Lantao, representative of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke. Guo Moruo expressed his hope at the meeting that the Resist America, Aid Korea movement would be deeply developed throughout North China, that the declaration and resolutions of the World Peace Council would be resolutely implemented, and that the region would strive to have 40 million people sign the declaration for the conclusion of a peace covenant.

　　Liu Lantao pointed out in his speech that: the scale and achievements of the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement in North China over the past five months have been unprecedented, and the vast majority of the people in the region have received patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea, but it must be further popularized and deepened so that every place and everyone regularly receives patriotic education. He suggested that the conference closely link the Resist America, Aid Korea movement with opposition to the United States' arming of Japan. The people of North China suffered greatly from the atrocities of the Japanese invaders during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and have rich experience in defeating the Japanese invaders. He hoped that through this representative conference, the people of the region would be further mobilized and organized to enthusiastically participate in the May 1st grand demonstration, and to support the hard-fighting Chinese People's Volunteer Army with practical actions. He hoped to deepen and consolidate the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in the region on the basis of popularization.
