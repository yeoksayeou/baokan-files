Luo Ruiqing, concurrently Director, replies to teachers, students, and staff of Huiwen Middle School
Welcoming assistance to the government in eliminating counter-revolutionaries

To all teachers, students, and staff of the private Huiwen Middle School in Beijing,

On March 31st, all teachers, students, and staff of the private Huiwen Middle School in Beijing wrote a letter to Luo Ruiqing, concurrently Director of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, expressing their enthusiastic support for the People's Government's resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries and their willingness to actively assist the government in eliminating counter-revolutionary elements. Luo Ruiqing, concurrently Director, replied on April 5th, encouraging the teachers, students, and staff of the school for their enthusiasm in cherishing the people's government and fighting against counter-revolutionary elements, and welcomed them to assist the government in eliminating counter-revolutionaries. The original texts of the two letters are as follows:

Respected Director Luo:

After studying the policies and documents on suppressing counter-revolutionaries last week, all teachers, students, and staff of our Huiwen Middle School conducted discussions. All teachers, students, and staff recognized the harm of counter-revolutionary elements to the cause of national construction. When all teachers, students, and staff talked about the past crimes of secret agents in our school, they gnashed their teeth and were filled with hatred. This week, we have seen and heard from newspapers and broadcasts that the enlarged joint meeting of people's representatives from all circles in Beijing Municipality and districts discussed the issue of punishing counter-revolutionary criminals. We unanimously believe that the people will not be at peace for a single day until the counter-revolutionary elements are eliminated, the country's construction cannot proceed smoothly, and our regime cannot be consolidated. On March 25th, when we saw that the government executed a group of counter-revolutionary ringleaders with heinous crimes, all teachers, students, and staff of the school cheered and jumped for joy, applauding and congratulating the government's actions of eliminating harm for the people and avenging the victims and patriotic people, expressing our sincere and heartfelt support.

In the future, we must enhance our vigilance, do a good job in the "three preventions" (preventing secret agents, preventing fire, preventing theft), protect our school, and assist the government in suppressing counter-revolutionary elements, report secret agents we know, and conduct propaganda among the broad masses and relatives and friends, mobilizing everyone to work together to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements as soon as possible and consolidate our regime.

With respect,
　　All teachers, students, and staff of the private Huiwen Middle School in Beijing
March 31st

Comrades of all teachers, students, and staff of Huiwen Middle School:

Your letter of March 31st has been received. Thank you for your enthusiastic support for the People's Government's resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The hatred for counter-revolutionary elements expressed in your letter once again proves that the People's Government's suppression of counter-revolutionaries fully represents the just demands of the broad masses of the people and is absolutely necessary.

Your enthusiasm for cherishing the people's government and fighting against counter-revolutionary elements is extremely valuable. I fully agree with the opinions you have put forward. I hope you will take active action, do a good job in the "three preventions," do a good job in propaganda, and assist the People's Government in thoroughly eliminating all counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, and protecting the safety of the capital and the people of the capital.

With respect,
　　　　Luo Ruiqing
April 5th

　　罗瑞卿兼局长函复汇文中学师生员工
    欢迎协助政府肃清反革命
    北京市私立汇文中学全体师生员工，于三月三十一日给北京市人民政府公安局兼局长罗瑞卿写了一封信，热烈拥护人民政府坚决镇压反革命，并愿积极协助政府肃清反革命分子。罗瑞卿兼局长于四月五日复信，鼓励该校师生员工这种爱护人民政权，并与反革命分子做斗争的热情，欢迎他们协助政府肃清反革命。两信原文如下：敬爱的罗局长：
    我们汇文中学全体师生员工于上周学习了镇压反革命的政策和文件后，又进行了讨论。全体师生员工都认识到反革命分子对祖国建设事业的危害。当全体师生员工谈到特务过去在我校的罪行时，都咬牙切齿，痛恨万分。这一周，我们又从报纸上和广播中，看到与听到北京市市、区各界人民代表扩大联席会议讨论惩治反革命罪犯的问题，我们一致认为反革命分子一天不消灭，人民就一天不安宁，国家的建设就不能顺利地进行，我们的政权就不能巩固。三月二十五日，我们看到政府处决了一批罪大恶极的反革命首恶分子后，全校师生员工都欢腾奔跳，拍手称快，对政府这种为人民除害，为被害的人民和爱国志士申雪仇恨的举动，表示衷心至诚地拥护。
    我们今后一定要提高警惕，做好三防（防特、防火、防盗）工作，保卫我们的学校，并协助政府镇压反革命分子，检举我们知道的特务，向广大群众和亲戚朋友进行宣传，动员大家一致努力，早日消灭反革命分子，巩固我们的政权。
    此致敬礼        北京市私立汇文中学全体师生员工  三月三十一日汇文中学全体师生员工同志们：
    三月三十一日的来信收到了。感谢你们对于人民政府坚决镇压反革命的热烈的拥护。你们来信中所表示的对反革命分子的仇恨，再次证明了人民政府镇压反革命乃是充分代表了广大人民的正义要求，是十分必要的。
    你们爱护人民政权与反革命分子做斗争的热情极可宝贵。我完全同意你们所提的意见，希望你们积极行动起来，做好三防工作，做好宣传工作，协助人民政府彻底肃清一切反革命的破坏活动，保卫首都和首都人民的安全。
          此致敬礼            罗瑞卿  四月五日
