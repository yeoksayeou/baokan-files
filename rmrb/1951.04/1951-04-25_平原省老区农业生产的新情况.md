The Policy Research Office of the Pingyuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted a survey of nine villages in Lin County—Datun, Yao Village (a model production village in 1950), Liutan, Dingjiao (a model production village in 1949), Lijiazhuang (a general village)—and in Qingfeng County—Ku Han Village (a county-level model village), Poli, Lüjialou (a general village), and Yang Han Village (a backward village)—to gain an in-depth understanding of agricultural production in the old liberated areas. From the materials of these nine villages, we can see the general picture of rural production in the old liberated areas of Pingyuan:

  I. Agricultural Production Has Recovered or Exceeded Pre-War Levels, but Development Is Uneven

    First, let's look at the changes in the main production conditions:

		            Pre-War   1950    Increase/Decrease
    Full Male Laborers	1606	1488	Decrease 118
    Semi/Female Laborers	2432	2781	Increase 349
    Mules/Horses	        118	33	Decrease 85
    Oxen/Donkeys	        537	647	Increase 110
    Large Farm Tools	1508	1397	Decrease 111
    Small Farm Tools	6709	9794	Increase 3085
    Large Carts	        89	84	Decrease 5
    Water Wells	        417	474	Increase 57
    Waterwheels	        1	15	Increase 14

    Some of these major production conditions have caught up with or exceeded pre-war levels, laying the foundation for further development of agricultural production. However, in terms of full male laborers (overall, there is a surplus of labor), mules, horses, large farm tools, and large carts, they are still inferior to pre-war levels and need further efforts to recover and develop.

    Second, let's look at the cultivation situation: Of the 194 households in Liutan Village, Lin County, 72 households, accounting for 37.1% of the total, have exceeded pre-war levels in terms of plowing, weeding, and fertilization; 93 households, accounting for 47.9% of the total, are equivalent to pre-war levels; and 29 households, accounting for 15% of the total, are still below pre-war levels. That is to say, 85% of households have caught up with or exceeded pre-war levels in terms of plowing, weeding, and fertilization. They have begun to improve cultivation methods and adopt some new technologies, such as pesticide application for insect control and selection and replacement of seeds. However, 15% of households are still below pre-war levels. These households are mostly families of martyrs, soldiers, staff, and widowers who lack labor, which is an issue that should be noted in the future.

    Third, from the perspective of production income: Agricultural production has exceeded pre-war output. In these nine villages, the total pre-war grain output was 14,522.9 *shi* (石, a unit of dry measure), and in 1950 it was 19,815.67 *shi*, exceeding the pre-war total output by 36%. The increase in output is due in part to the expansion of cultivated land area and the improvement of cultivation level, but another important reason is the increase in industrial raw material crops. For example, in the five villages of Lin County, only 336 *jin* (斤, a unit of weight) of cotton were harvested before the war, and in 1950, 13,546 *jin* of cotton were harvested, nearly 40 times more than before the war. Before the war, tobacco and indigo converted to rice were 74 *shi*, and in 1950, the converted rice reached 12,963 *shi*, exceeding pre-war levels by 175.1%. The output of miscellaneous grains increased by 7% compared to pre-war levels. This can represent the general situation of old liberated areas with many industrial raw material crops.

    In terms of sideline occupations, the development situation varies greatly from place to place. In the five villages of Lin County, there were 22 workshops before the war, and 38 in 1950. The income of craftsmen active outside the villages is also very high, with each artisan saving and sending home 4,000 to 5,000 *jin* of rice per year. In October 1950, the wages of workers returning home after exchanging money through the bank reached 200 million *yuan*, and in November it exceeded 200 million *yuan*. In the four villages of Qingfeng, however, due to the narrow avenues for sideline production, income is still lower than before the war.

  II. Farmers' Lives Have Improved Initially, but a Small Number of Farm Households Still Face Difficulties

    Farmers' lives have generally improved, which is first reflected in the fact that middle peasants account for the vast majority of the rural population. The percentages of middle peasants in the total number of households and population in the nine villages of the two counties are as follows:

		        Lin County (5 Villages)	Qingfeng County (4 Villages)
	Households	        86.9%	                90.0%
	Population	        87.1%	                96.0%
	Cultivated Land	91.6%	                90.0%
	Livestock	        98.7%	                93.0%
	Large Farm Tools	95.0%	                95.5%

    In the five villages of Lin County, middle peasant households accounted for only 43% before the war, but now it has increased to 86%. In the four villages of Qingfeng, among the 574 middle peasant households, 296 new households have risen to the level of middle peasants, accounting for 51.6% of the total number of middle peasant households. This is the basic situation in rural areas after the land reform.

    Secondly, in terms of food grain, 90% of farm households have a surplus or enough to eat. Of the 1,833 households in the five villages of the two counties, 690 households have surplus grain, accounting for 37.6% of the total number of households; 969 households have enough to eat, accounting for 52.9% of the total number of households; however, there are still 174 households lacking grain, accounting for 9.5% of the total number of households.

    The living standards of farmers are generally higher than in the past. Except for disaster areas, very few people are eating bran. However, they still maintain a frugal and thrifty lifestyle, generally consuming an average of one *jin* of rice per person per day (according to a survey, 16 middle peasant households in Qingfeng consume an average of 510 to 555 *jin* of raw grain per person per year). At the same time, savings are still not high, and the ability to expand reproduction and prevent disasters is still limited.

  III. Land Ownership Has Begun to Undergo New Changes

    Among the 1,833 households in the nine villages, 131 households have bought land, accounting for 7.1% of the total number of households, purchasing 237.35 *mu* (亩, a unit of area) of land. The reasons for buying land are as follows:

		         Lin County	Qingfeng County	Total	Percent
    Farming Savings	52 Households	33 Households	85 Households	64.9%
    Wage Income	        22 Households	4 Households	26 Households	19.8%
    Sideline Production		        5 Households	5 Households	3.8%
    Land Exchange	        13 Households	2 Households	15 Households	11.5%
    Total	                87 Households	44 Households	131 Households	100.0%

    The increase in the number of land-buying households indicates the high enthusiasm of farmers for production. However, some farmers place their hopes for further prosperity entirely on buying land. As soon as someone mentions wanting to sell land, many people will try to persuade them to sell it quickly, and even farmers from advanced production villages will go to backward production villages to inquire about who is selling land, which leads to rising land prices. For example, in Qingfeng, the price of land was generally around 300 *jin* of wheat per *mu* in 1949, but it rose to 600 *jin* in 1950. In Lin County, a *mu* of paddy field was sold for 6,000 *jin* of grain, exceeding the highest pre-war price. Some farmers complained, "The government is leading production everywhere, but no one is selling land. How can we get rich?" The direction of organizing to improve technology and develop production is not clear enough.

    There are 133 households selling land, accounting for 7.3% of the total number of households, selling 278.25 *mu* of land. The number of land-selling households in each class is as follows:

		         Lin County	Qingfeng County	Total	Percent
    Former Landlords/Rich Peasants	8 Households	3 Households	11 Households	8.3%
    Old Middle Peasants	        18 Households	18 Households	36 Households	27.0%
    New Middle Peasants	        46 Households	33 Households	79 Households	59.4%
    Poor Peasants	        4 Households	3 Households	7 Households	5.3%
    Total	                76 Households	57 Households	133 Households	100.0%

    The reasons for selling land: Among the 133 households, 57 households sold land due to adjusting production (including exchanging land, buying livestock, buying large farm tools, etc.), 9 households sold land for sideline business capital, 29 households sold land due to weddings, funerals, and illnesses, 36 households sold land due to living difficulties, and 2 households sold land to build houses. From the above statistics, although the number of land sold due to adjusting production is not small, those sold due to weddings, funerals, illnesses, and living difficulties also account for half.

    Due to land sales and purchases, the land ownership situation after the land reform has begun to undergo new changes. For example, Chen Xitang's family of four in Yang Han Village, Qingfeng, has increased to 29 *mu* of land, averaging more than 7 *mu* per person, more than double the village average of 3.5 *mu*. On the other hand, a household in Lüjialou with one person originally had three *mu* of land, but has sold two *mu* and only has one *mu* left. Therefore, developing rural lending, implementing organization, educating and transforming some people who are fond of eating but do not know how to manage their lives, and helping them formulate production and living plans should be an important task for leading production in the future.

  IV. Farmers' Enthusiasm for Production Is High, and They Universally Demand Further Development of Production

    Due to the correct implementation of policies to reward and protect production, farmers who have been liberated from the feudal system have high enthusiasm for production. Their main demands in production at present are:

    First, appropriately improve farm tools, improve technology, and expand reproduction. Farmers demand to replace bucket-draw wells with waterwheels, small carts with large carts, small livestock with large livestock, use improved seeds, and learn insect control methods. In particular, production activists are very welcoming when they hear about new farm tools, demanding to see and try them, and inquiring about prices everywhere. Labor models like to receive new farm tools as prizes the most.

    Second, combine agricultural and sideline occupations, promote internal and external exchanges, and increase income. Generally speaking, farmers in villages with more land require the development of sideline occupations that directly support agriculture (such as opening oil mills, flour mills, and increasing fertilizer); farmers in villages with less land require the development of various sideline productions to increase income. The current problem is how to organize surplus labor and develop promising sideline production. This issue must be paid attention to by the leadership.

    Third, overcome production difficulties. Of the 1,195 households in the five villages of Lin County, 740 households still do not have livestock, accounting for 62% of the total number of households; 637 households lack major farm tools, accounting for 53% of the total number of households; 165 households do not have full male labor, accounting for 13% of the total number of households; and 178 households have too little land, accounting for 15% of the total number of households. It is still necessary to strengthen support for them and help them overcome difficulties.

    Fourth, develop and organize rural credit. At present, free lending has been carried out in some villages. For example, according to statistics from four villages in Qingfeng, it is known that there are 33 households with longer-term lending, lending 25 *shi* of grain (mostly wheat, some lent to faraway places); there are 22 households borrowing, borrowing 11 *shi* of grain. However, interest rates are generally very high, with some eating one *dou* (斗, a unit of dry measure) of coarse grain before wheat harvest and repaying one *dou* of wheat after the wheat harvest; or eating one *dou* of wheat and repaying one *dou* and one or two *sheng* (升, a unit of dry measure) to one *dou* and five *sheng* of wheat per month; some even charge two *sheng* of interest per month for eating one *dou*. Farmers still have concerns about lending, and many lending relationships are afraid to be made public. Farmers universally demand the development of rural lending and the organization of farmers' credit cooperatives to revitalize rural financial turnover and solve production and living difficulties.

  V. Adapt to Farmers' Demands and Further Develop and Improve Mutual Aid Organizations

    Before 1948, in order to solve the contradiction between production and participation in the war, Lin County and Qingfeng County implemented large-group mutual aid, which led to coercion and commandism, leaving a bad impression. Later, voluntary combination was promoted, and large-group mutual aid disintegrated, but another deviation occurred: cadres abandoned their leadership over mutual aid groups, resulting in self-flow. Since 1949, the two counties have generally adopted the policy of "patient persuasion and typical demonstration," and in 1950, mutual aid content was increased in terms of improving technology and combining agriculture and sideline occupations, allowing the mutual aid movement to develop further. In Lin County's four villages in 1950, 161 mutual aid production groups with 497 households were organized, accounting for 41.6% of the total number of households, 34.5% of the total cultivated land, 42.7% of the total labor force, and 51.5% of the total number of livestock. In Qingfeng's Ku Han, Poli, and Lüjialou villages, 83 groups with 254 households have been organized for mutual aid, accounting for 58.1% of the total number of households, 62% of the male labor force, and 77.75% of the livestock. In the 83 groups with 254 households participating in mutual aid in Qingfeng's three villages, there are 35 groups with 93 households sharing plowing oxen; 18 groups with 53 households mainly sharing plowing oxen, and also exchanging labor during busy farming seasons. Combining agriculture and sideline occupations with long-term labor and livestock exchange is not yet widespread enough. In Lin County's 161 groups with 497 households, only 13 groups with 50 households are well-organized and operate regular mutual aid groups, accounting for only 10% of all organized households. The remaining 90% are: 46 groups with 150 households of voluntary seasonal mutual aid groups, 24 groups with 65 households of temporary small labor exchange groups, 61 groups with 174 households of relatives helping each other with work, 2 groups with 4 households of farmers and shepherds/handicraft workers mutually helping each other to cultivate land, and 15 groups with 54 households of jointly operating sideline businesses. Therefore, how to further improve the mutual aid groups is still a major issue at present.

    In order to adapt to the new situation of production development, farmers' demands for mutual aid are urgent. For example, developing water conservancy, adopting new technologies, developing sideline occupations, building houses, transforming soil, and developing sheep flocks all require organizing mutual aid to solve. From the perspective of the organization in these nine villages, the leadership must further conduct specific research and in-depth leadership, understand the current basic situation of mutual aid and the masses' understanding and attitude towards mutual aid, summarize the achievements of mutual aid, improve the masses' awareness, find good examples, and establish banners to advance the policy of organizing production further, in order to adapt to the current demands of farmers.

　　平原省老区农业生产的新情况
    王耕今　张器先整理
    中共平原省委政策研究室为了深入了解老区农业生产情况，曾调查了林县的大屯、姚村（一九五○年的生产模范村）、柳滩、定角（一九四九年的生产模范村）、李家庄（一般村）和清丰县的库韩村（全县模范村）、坡里、吕家楼（一般村）、杨韩村（落后村）等九个村庄。从这九个村的材料中，可以看出平原老区农村生产的一般面貌：
  一、农业生产已经恢复或超过了战前水平，但发展还不平衡
    首先从主要生产条件的变化上来看：
                战前        一九五○年    增    减差男全劳力        一六○六个  一四八八个    减    一一八个半劳力和女劳力  二四三二个  二七八一个    增    三四九个骡、马          一一八头    三三头        减    八五头牛、驴          五三七头    六四七头      增    一一○头大农具          一五○八件  一三九七件    减    一一一件小农具          六七○九件  九七九四件    增    三○八五件大车             八九辆      八四辆       减    五辆水井              四一七个    四七四个    增    五七个水车            一辆        一五辆        增    一四辆
    这些主要的生产条件，有的已经赶上或超过了战前的水平，奠定了进一步发展农业生产的基础，但在男全劳力（总起来劳力已有剩余）、骡马、大农具、大车等方面，还不如战前，须进一步地努力，以求恢复和发展。
    其次，从耕作的情况上来看：林县柳滩村一九四户中，在耕、锄和施肥方面已经超过战前的有七二户，占总户数的百分之三七·一，相当于战前的有九三户，占总户数的百分之四七·九，不及战前的尚有二九户，占总户数的百分之一五。也就是说，有百分之八五的户，已在耕、锄和施肥方面，赶上或超过了战前。他们已开始改善耕作方法，采用某些新式技术，如药剂杀虫，选种换种等。但仍有百分之一五的户，还不及战前。这些户多是缺乏劳力的烈士、军人、工作人员家属和鳏寡孤独，这是今后应当注意的一个问题。
    再次，从生产收入上看：农业生产已经超过了战前的产量。在这九村中，战前原粮总产量为一四、五二二·九石，一九五○年为一九、八一五·六七石，超过了战前总产量的百分之三六。产量的增加，一方面是由于耕地面积扩大和耕作水平的提高，而另一重要原因则是工业原料作物的增加。如林县五村中，战前收棉仅三三六斤，一九五○年收棉达一三、五四六斤，超过战前近四十倍；战前烟、靛折米七四石，一九五○年折米达一二、九六三石，超过战前一七五·一倍；杂粮较战前增加百分之七。这可以代表工业原料作物多的老区的一般情形。
    在副业方面，各地发展情况很不相同。林县五村战前有作坊二十二座，一九五○年有三十八座；在外活动的工匠收入也很多，每个手艺工人每年可净存四、五千斤米寄回家中。一九五○年十月份在外工人经银行兑款回家的工资达两亿元，十一月份超过两亿元。清丰四村中，则因副业生产门路不广，收入还不及战前。
  二、农民生活已有初步改善，少数农户仍有困难
    农民生活已经普遍地有所改善，这首先表现在中农在农村中已占绝大比重。两县九村中农所占全村户数、人口等的百分比如下：
    林县五村      清丰四村
    户数      八六·九      九○·○
    人口      八七·一      九六·○
    耕地      九一·六      九○·○
    牲口      九八·七      九三·○
    大农具    九五·○      九五·五
    林县五村战前中农户只有百分之四三，现已增至百分之八六。清丰四村五七四户中农中，新上升的中农有二九六户，占中农户数的百分之五一·六。这是土地改革后农村的基本情况。
    其次在食粮方面，已有百分之九十的农户有存余或够用了。两县五村一、八三三户中，有存粮的六九○户，占总户数的百分之三七·六；已够吃用的九六九户，占总户数的百分之五二·九；但缺粮户还有一七四户，占总户数的百分之九·五。
    农民生活水平一般比过去提高了。除灾区外，吃糠的已经很少。但仍保持着俭朴节约的生活，大体上平均每人一天消费一斤米（据调查，清丰十六户中农平均每人每年消费原粮五一○至五五五斤）；同时积蓄也还不多，扩大再生产及防灾能力还不大。
  三、土地占有情况开始发生了新的变化
    九村一、八三三户中已有买地户一三一户，占总户数的百分之七·一，买入土地二三七·三五亩。买地原因如下：
            林县        清丰县        合计        百分比农耕积蓄    五二户      三三户        八五户      六四·九工资收入    二二户      四户          二六户      一九·八副业生产                五户          五户        三·八掉换土地    一三户      二户          一五户      一一·五合计        八七户      四四户        一三一户    一○○·○
    买地户的增多，说明了农民生产情绪的高涨。但有一部分农民把进一步富裕的希望，完全寄托在买地上，谁家一提想卖地，便有许有人去动员他快卖早卖，甚至有生产先进村的农民跑到生产落后村去打听有谁卖地，地价因而高涨。如清丰，一九四九年每亩地价一般在三百斤麦左右，一九五○年涨到了六百斤；林县一亩水地有卖到六千斤粮食的，超过了战前的最高价格。有的农民反映说：“政府到处领导生产，没有人卖地了，怎能富裕？”对于组织起来提高技术，发展生产的方向，是不够明确的。
    出卖土地的有一三三户，占总户数的百分之七点三，卖出土地二七八·二五亩。各阶层卖地户数如下：
               林县      清丰县      合计      百分比原地主富农    八户      三户        一一户    八·三老中农        一八户    一八户      三六户    二七·○新中农        四六户    三三户      七九户    五九·四贫农          四户      三户        七户      五·三合计          七六户    五七户      一三三户  一○○·○
    出卖土地的原因：在一三三户中，因调整生产而出卖土地者五七户（包括换地、买牲口、买大农具大车等），因做副业资本而出卖土地者九户，因婚丧疾病者二九户，因生活困难者三六户，修建房屋者二户。从以上的统计看来，由于调整生产而出卖土地者为数虽不少，但由于婚丧疾病和生活困难的却也占半数。
    由于土地买卖，土地改革后的土地占有情况，开始了新的变化。如清丰杨韩村陈喜堂四口人，已增至二九亩地，每人平均七亩多，超过本村平均三·五亩的一倍多。而吕家楼一户一人，原有三亩地，已出卖了二亩，仅剩下一亩。因此，开展农村借贷，贯彻组织起来，对部分好吃而不会过时光的人，加以教育改造，帮助他们订立生产生活计划，应作为今后领导生产的一项重要工作。
  四、农民生产情绪高涨，普遍要求进一步发展生产
    由于正确执行了奖励和保护生产的政策，从封建制度下解放出来的农民，生产情绪是高涨的。他们目前在生产上主要的要求是：
    第一、适当改良农具，提高技术，扩大再生产。农民要求把辘辘换成水车，小车换成大车，小牲口换成大牲口，使用优良种子，学习除虫方法。特别是生产积极分子一听说有新的农具，就格外欢迎，要求眼见手试，并到处打听价格。劳动模范最喜欢的是得到新式农具的奖品。
    第二、农副业结合，内外交流，增加收入。一般地说，土地较多的村的农民，要求发展直接扶助农业的副业（如开油坊、粉坊，增加肥料）；土地较少的村庄的农民，则要求开展各种各样的副业生产，增加收入。当前的问题是如何组织剩余劳力，开展有出路的副业生产。这一问题领导上必须予以注意。
    第三、克服生产困难。林县五村一、一九五户中，没牲口的还有七四○户，占总户数的百分之六十二；缺主要农具的有六三七户，占总户数的百分之五十三；没男全劳动力的有一六五户，占总户数的百分之十三；土地太少的一七八户，占总户数的百分之十五。还须注意加强对他们的扶持，帮助他们克服困难。
    第四、发展和组织农村信贷。目前自由借贷，在部分村庄，已有开展。例如根据清丰四个村的统计，已知较长期放贷者有三三户，贷粮二十五石（多是麦子，有放到远处的）；借贷者二二户，借粮十一石。但利息一般都很大，有的麦前吃一斗粗粮，麦后还一斗麦；或吃一斗麦还一斗一、二升至一斗五升麦；还有的吃一斗，一个月出二升利的。在借贷中农民仍然存在着顾虑，许多借贷关系不敢公开。农民普遍要求发展农村借贷，组织农民信用合作，活跃农村金融的周转，以解决生产和生活上的困难。
  五、适应农民要求，进一步发展与提高互助组织
    一九四八年以前，为了解决生产与参战的矛盾，林县、清丰都曾实行大组互助，发生了强迫命令的偏向，留下了不好的影响；以后提倡自愿结合，大组互助解体，但又发生了另一偏向，干部放弃了对互助组的领导，形成了自流。一九四九年以来，该两县一般采取了“耐心说服，典型示范”的方针，一九五○年又在提高技术，农业、副业结合等方面，增加了互助的内容，使互助运动有了进一步的发展。林县四村一九五○年组织起来互助生产的有一六一组四九七户，占总户数的百分之四一·六，总耕地的百分之三四·五，劳力总数的百分之四二·七，牲口总数的百分之五一·五。清丰库韩、坡里、吕家楼三村已组织互助的有八三组，二五四户，占总户数的百分之五八·一，男劳力的百分之六二，牲口的百分之七七·七五。在清丰三村参加互助的八三组，二五四户中，以牲口搭犋的有三五组，九三户；以牲口搭犋为主，农忙时劳力也变工者十八组，五三户；农副业结合，劳畜力长期变工者则还不够普遍。在林县四村一六一组四九七户中，实行自愿两利组织较健全的经常互助组，只有一三组五○户，仅占全部组织起来户数的百分之十。其余百分之九十为：自愿结合的季节性互助组四六组一五○户，临时小变工搭犋二四组六五户，亲属互相帮助作活的六一组一七四户，农户与羊工、手工工人互助种地的二组四户，合伙经营副业的一五组五四户。因此如何进一步提高互助组，在目前还是一个大问题。
    为了适应生产发展的新情况，农民对互助的要求是迫切的。例如发展水利，采用新式技术，发展副业，修建房屋，改造土壤，发展羊群等，都需要组织互助才能解决。从这九个村组织起来的情况看，领导上还须进一步地具体研究和深入领导，了解现在互助的基本情况及群众对互助的认识和态度，总结互助的成绩，提高群众的觉悟，找出好的典型，树立旗帜，把组织起来发展生产的政策向前推进一步，以适应当前农民的要求。
