Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 4th: The German people are vigorously supporting the Korean people who are engaged in a war of liberation. The German People's Support Korea Committee has so far raised 4,675,147 marks, two ambulances, 1,742 boxes of medicines, as well as woolen cloth, shoes and socks.

The German People's Support Korea Committee was established shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War, and five local committees were subsequently established. In an appeal to the German people, the committee emphasized: "We, the German people, are particularly concerned about the Korean people's struggle for liberation, because American and British imperialism are trying to repeat in Germany tomorrow what they are doing in Korea today." Now, a large number of medicines and thermometers have been raised in factories, mines, schools and government agencies. Workers in many factories have organized special Aid Korea Teams and Kim Il-sung Work Teams, which over fulfill production plans by 150% to 200% and donate all their overtime wages. Students and teachers in Leipzig, Dresden and other places have announced their willingness to donate blood. Students at the Technical University of West Berlin have also made donations.

    【新华社柏林四日电】德国人民正大力支援进行解放战争的朝鲜人民。德国人民支援朝鲜委员会迄今已募集四百六十七万五千一百四十七马克、二辆救护车、一千七百四十二箱药品，以及呢绒布匹和鞋袜等物。
    德国人民支援朝鲜委员会在朝鲜战争发生后不久即已成立，以后又成立了五个地方委员会。该委员会在致德国人民的呼吁书中强调说：“我们德国人民特别关心朝鲜人民的解放斗争，因为美、英帝国主义正企图把它们今天在朝鲜所干的事情明天在德国重演。”现在，在各工厂、矿场、学校和政府机关里，已募得大批药品和体温表。许多工厂的工人组织了特别援助朝鲜班和金日成工作班，他们以百分之一百五十到百分之二百超额完成生产计划，并把他们所有加班工资全部捐献出来。来比锡、德累斯顿和其他地方的学生和教员都宣布愿意输血。西柏林技术大学的学生也有捐献。
