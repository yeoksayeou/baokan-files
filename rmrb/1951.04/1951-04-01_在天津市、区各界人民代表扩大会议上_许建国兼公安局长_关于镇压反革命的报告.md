Comrades of the Presidium and People's Representatives from all walks of life:

Since the Central People's Government has repeatedly issued instructions on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the handling of counter-revolutionary criminals, it has become an important political task for all the people of Tianjin. In the past year, a detailed report on the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in Tianjin was given at the Third Session of the Second Tianjin Municipal People's Representatives Conference. After thorough discussion, the conference approved the report and made a resolution on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the future. In order to faithfully implement the resolution of the conference, and in accordance with the spirit of the Central Government's Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, we have thoroughly reviewed the backlog of cases in custody, and based on the systematic materials accumulated by the Public Security Bureau over the past two years through long-term and careful investigation, we have arrested another group of counter-revolutionaries. Among them, some are the main culprits who have consistently engaged in counter-revolutionary activities in history, and counter-revolutionaries who have not repented after being treated with leniency by the People's Government. In addition to the initial arrests of some of these main counter-revolutionaries at the beginning of liberation, the remaining group anonymously hid in our city, willingly hostile to the people, and continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, remaining at large and very rampant. In addition, some counter-revolutionaries have refused to bow their heads to the people, confess their crimes, and perform meritorious service since the promulgation of the registration method of Military Control Commission Notice No. 9. Instead, they adopted false registration, refused to register, or concealed counter-revolutionary organizations during registration, deceived the People's Government, and used "legality" as a cover to continue to carry out sabotage activities. Furthermore, the US imperialists and their running dogs, the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, rely on Hong Kong and Taiwan to train secret agents and spies, dispatching them to Tianjin to collect intelligence, steal state secrets, engage in assassination activities, and undermine national construction, endangering the safety of our people's lives and property. Our people and the people's regime are still being harassed and sabotaged by these counter-revolutionaries. This situation is intolerable to our People's Government and the two million people of Tianjin.

Recently, we have conducted a review in accordance with the spirit of the Central People's Government's Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries and the decision of the First Session of the Third Tianjin Municipal People's Representatives Conference on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities. The reasons for this are that in the past, our understanding of the policy of combining suppression with leniency formulated by Chairman Mao and the Central Committee was insufficient. The work in the past has indeed achieved great results; however, in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, there were some shortcomings and errors. That is, the suppression of the main counter-revolutionaries and those who stubbornly continued to do evil after liberation was not timely, and some were handled too slowly and too leniently. Leniency was given where it should not have been given. Some of the main culprits who committed heinous crimes and did many evils, and those who continued to carry out sabotage activities after being treated with leniency, were not resolutely and promptly suppressed. On this point, the people of Tianjin are dissatisfied with us, thus hindering the enthusiasm of the masses to fight against counter-revolutionaries, and objectively helping and encouraging the arrogance of counter-revolutionaries, enabling them to continue to remain at large and exploit our loopholes. This is our "one-sided leniency" error. Because of this error, those counter-revolutionaries who have harmed the people and committed heinous crimes have not yet received the punishment they deserve, and the hidden counter-revolutionaries have not been thoroughly purged. If these deadly dregs of society are not completely eliminated, how can the safety of the people's lives and property be guaranteed? How can the various constructions in Tianjin be carried out smoothly?

In order to implement the resolutions of the People's Representatives Conference, and in accordance with the sentencing standards stipulated in the Central Government's Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, we have recently initially screened a batch of counter-revolutionary cases that have been backlogged in the past and those currently arrested. Among them, many are counter-revolutionaries who are determined to be enemies of the people, committed heinous crimes, and should repay their debts to the people. They should be swiftly and resolutely suppressed! (Applause) These elements include Kuomintang secret agent LÃ¼ Yimin, who has been engaged in counter-revolutionary activities for more than 20 years and was the murderer of the anti-Japanese hero General Ji Hongchang. Zhu Shiyin, during the Anti-Japanese War, helped the Japanese invaders and was the murderer of the massacre of more than 1,200 people in Panjiayu. The big traitor Gao Tiehou, nicknamed Gao Yanwang, as the chief of the Beidaihe police station, slaughtered more than 60 lives of our people and cadres. Kuomintang secret agent Shen Jinggui has been engaged in counter-revolutionary activities for 21 years. Before the liberation of Baoding in 1948, he masterminded the Baoding massacre. These are all heinous counter-revolutionary main culprits with accumulated blood debts. Those who stubbornly continued counter-revolutionary activities after liberation, such as Sun Furui, Li Zhong'e, Zhou Dawen, and Yang Yimin, were all from the puppet army and held important positions in the bandit party. They assassinated our revolutionary cadres Zhao Luoyun and others, five people in total. After liberation, they colluded with Guo Yanting, a retained personnel of our Foreign Trade Bureau, to probe into state secrets and colluded with reactionary landlords to organize and collect Chiang bandit soldiers and vagrants to conspire to riot. Another example is the chief criminal of the "North China Volunteer Salvation National Corps" case, Wang Yongheng, Zhang Hongchuan, and Li Qinsheng, who fabricated a blacklist for the bandit gang in the Hebei Institute of Technology before liberation, sabotaged the student movement, and after liberation, they were led by the bandit "Pingjinji Re Investigation Office" and lurked in the school, gathering Kuomintang and Three Youth League elements in the city, engaged in counter-revolutionary activities and attempted to use hand grenades to sabotage the meeting place during the 1949 National Day. Another example is Yan Sanhe of the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, who was a Japanese spy in the past and killed many of our cadres in Shanxi. After liberation, he pretended to be active, concealed his identity, and infiltrated the Communist Party to engage in espionage and sabotage activities. Liu Lida was a Kuomintang district branch committee member and Green Gang boss who lurked in the repair shop of the Haihe Engineering Office, stuffed a one-foot-long iron rod into the electric motor, sabotaged the machine, and broke a worker's finger.

Wu Shutian, the secretary of the Chiang Kai-shek party district branch, continuously placed hand grenades in the reed chopping room of the paper mill to carry out sabotage. The secret agent Su Dian lurked in the Supply Bureau and stole the bureau's 1951 safekeeping work plan. The Kuomintang secret agents Jia Xianglin and Ou Sichun, who lurked in the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, threw four saw blades into the No. 5 cleaning machine in the opening room, and caused the motor to explode three times in a row, causing a fire and destroying seven looms. The rampant behavior of these bandits has really reached an intolerable level. Some are evil bullies and hooligans who have committed many evils, such as Wang Shijiang, one of the "Ten Evils," Wang Jiabin, Wang Jiaqi, and Wang Jiazong, one of the "Four Tyrants," and Sun Qisan, the "Eastern Tyrant," are all bullies who fly tickets, use nets, and prey on the people. Can we let them remain at large? There are also heads of feudal secret societies who engage in counter-revolutionary espionage activities. Such as Wang Ziquan and Jia Xianglin of the World New Buddhist Church, who organized the "Bagua Army" to plot a riot after liberation. Wang Jingwen, the ringleader of the Yiguandao bandits, accepted the task of the Kuomintang secret service organization, the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense, organized the Anti-Communist Volunteer Army, and attempted to riot. Such examples are too numerous to mention. These people oppose the government and intimidate the people. We cannot but arrest them, (People shout: Arrest them!) and cannot but suppress them. (People shout: Suppress them!) Is it appropriate to arrest and suppress these counter-revolutionaries? Please criticize, supervise and review our work by the representatives of the people from all walks of life, and make a decision so that it can be implemented accordingly.

After such saboteurs were arrested, the people of Tianjin were overjoyed. This can be described most appropriately in eight characters, which is "the people are happy, and the secret agents are panicked." (Applause) Since the arrest of these counter-revolutionaries, the victims have filed lawsuits one after another. They said, "The government has woken up!" "Now there is really law and heaven." Some citizens said, "These guys should have been arrested long ago!" And also said, "Why haven't some bad elements been arrested?" Since the arrest of these elements, the people believe that this is truly being the master for the people and avenging the people. Recently, the Public Security Bureau has received an average of thirty to forty letters of denunciation every day. (Applause) At the same time, it is also a very significant blow to counter-revolutionary saboteurs. (Applause) Therefore, some counter-revolutionaries have voluntarily surrendered and confessed to the public security organs. The people's awareness is increasing day by day, and the hidden secret agents will never escape the people's giant palms. (Applause) Therefore, the only way out for counter-revolutionaries is to bow their heads to the people, confess to the government, and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. Has the government's policy changed as a result? Our answer is no, the policy of combining leniency and suppression is the basic policy of the People's Government, it was so in the past, and it still is now. However, in the past period, there was a "one-sided leniency" bias in mastering and implementing it. The leniency was somewhat unbounded, that is, the main culprits and those who stubbornly continued to do evil were not suppressed in a timely manner, or the suppression was insufficient. Since the people have raised their opinions to us, we have reviewed and corrected it. What does this policy of combining leniency and suppression include?

First of all, let's talk about leniency! That is, for those who have committed serious crimes, but have now truly repented and performed meritorious service for the people; for those who were forced to participate in counter-revolutionary activities; or those whose counter-revolutionary crimes before liberation were not serious, and who have truly repented after liberation and broken ties with counter-revolutionary organizations, we have already treated these elements leniently in the past, and we will still treat them leniently now. Today is the same as in the past, and there is no change. We will release another group after screening the detainees. In the future, we will still give lenient treatment to the general reactionary elements who sincerely repent and bow their heads to the people to confess their crimes and are willing to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. Some of the supervised elements, as long as they are determined to turn back to good and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes, and are proven by the masses to have performed well, can have their supervision lifted, their civil rights restored, and be given the opportunity to become new people again. Also, leniency is extended to those who surrender and those who perform meritorious service. For those counter-revolutionary ringleaders who have committed heinous crimes, for those secret agents and spies who stubbornly continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities after liberation, for those counter-revolutionaries who have committed evil again after being treated with leniency, for those habitual bandits, bullies, hooligans, murderers, and reactionary secret society leaders who have committed serious crimes, for those unrepentant counter-revolutionaries who deserve to die, absolute leniency cannot be given (applause) and should be severely suppressed. (Applause) If we do not do so, the people's lives and property cannot be guaranteed, construction cannot be carried out smoothly, the people will suffer, and the state power cannot be consolidated. Therefore: The correct policy of combining leniency and suppression must be taken into account, and neither can be neglected. This is the wise instruction of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee.

In order to ensure the correct implementation of this policy, we have adopted a serious and cautious attitude and stipulated some specific implementation methods, which is to strengthen investigation and research, seek truth from facts, rely on evidence, and not easily believe rumors. The arrest of a criminal must go through five procedures of review. If there is any doubt about a small detail, it is better not to arrest and not allow mistakes. As for sentencing and executing criminals, more stringent procedures are adopted. Some are reviewed and approved by the Military Control Commission, the Mayor, the People's Court, and even the Central People's Court before they can be executed.

In this way, we can ensure that no good person is wronged, and no counter-revolutionary element is allowed to remain at large.

Regarding the handling of mass tip-offs and letters of denunciation, we also adopt the above-mentioned principles, never engage in careless and perfunctory actions, but conduct thorough investigation and research, and be responsible to the people with a high degree of responsibility to prevent the occurrence of framing good people or using public office for private revenge. For the past two years, we have been conscientiously implementing it under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central Committee, and our Tianjin Mayor Huang. This is the situation of our past policy implementation. Only in this way can we implement the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries.

This time, severely suppressing counter-revolutionaries is a good education for the people, making everyone clearly recognize the two-sidedness and despicable and vicious means of counter-revolutionaries. They harmed the people. Under the reactionary rule, the people dared to be angry but dared not speak out, and many people did not know about it. After liberation, they often still thought they were friends of the people. Now the crimes of these counter-revolutionaries are nakedly exposed before the people. The facts of these counter-revolutionaries' activities can also help us overcome paralysis of thought. We can learn many lessons from the Wu Cunzhu incident of the evil landlord; an evil landlord full of blood debts fled to Tianjin, using the relationship of relatives and friends as a cover to carry out counter-revolutionary activities of sabotaging production and construction and harming revolutionary cadres. From here, we can realize that if we do not raise our vigilance, do not severely suppress counter-revolutionaries, and let the enemy live on, the lives of our people will inevitably be threatened with death. Should we let the enemy live on? Or should the safety of the people's lives and property be guaranteed? Two paths must be chosen. Now we affirm that we want the people to live on and live happily. Now we have realized that although the open enemy with guns has been eliminated, the hidden enemy still wants to treat us with the most vicious means, so we must raise our vigilance, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, break personal relationships, and the people and the government unite to complete this long-term and arduous political task, thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionaries (applause), and resolutely and ruthlessly suppress counter-revolutionary activities to ensure the safety of the people's lives and property and the construction of various undertakings in the new China, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. (Prolonged applause)

In the process of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, a few people are suspicious, uneasy, and panicked. This is also inevitable. There are three different types of people among them: Due to the enemy's long-term reactionary rule and deceptive propaganda before liberation, some people have been deeply poisoned by the enemy, and after liberation, they more or less reveal some backward thinking; also, due to some shortcomings in the work style of our cadres, some people are dissatisfied, and therefore show a little antagonistic emotion, and these people are panicked. Chairman Mao has already said that this is an internal matter of our four friends and cannot be compared with counter-revolution. What is counter-revolution? It is saboteurs who have participated in counter-revolutionary organizations, have not broken away from the enemy after liberation, accept their tasks, carry out organized sabotage activities, and attempt to subvert the People's Government.

In addition, some people protect themselves wisely, are indifferent to the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and think that this is a matter for the government and the Public Security Bureau, separating the government from themselves, losing the people's position, purely "humanitarian" viewpoint, and even have the idea that they can live peacefully with counter-revolutionaries, or leave room for these counter-revolutionaries, and stand outside the front line of the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries. This passive thinking and attitude should be overcome, and everyone has the responsibility to help them correct their understanding. Tell them that revolution and counter-revolution are irreconcilable, organize them and everyone to unite and jointly suppress counter-revolutionaries.

Those who have participated in reactionary parties, groups, or general anti-espionage groups have also panicked.

The handling of the arrested counter-revolutionary criminals is the issue that everyone is most concerned about. We have received many opinions from the people, and we will definitely severely suppress those who should be suppressed according to the demands of the people. The main culprits who owe blood debts and deserve to die, the unrepentant elements, those who have consistently made counter-revolution their living in history, the habitual bandits who are deeply hated by the people for their accumulated blood debts, the bandit leaders, evil bullies, big hooligans who forcefully occupy other people's wives and dominate one side, murderers, and leaders of reactionary secret societies who plunder the people's property and kill the people and still engage in counter-revolutionary activities after registration, must be severely suppressed. (Applause from all sides) Some counter-revolutionaries whose crimes do not deserve death, but who endanger the people if placed in society, rely on imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang to rule, oppress, and persecute the people for a living, and still fantasize about the return of the US and Chiang Kai-shek today, restoring their life of oppressing and persecuting the people, they must be detained and transformed for a long time, and they must never be released to persecute the people again. (Applause) In addition, some people should be subjected to a certain period of supervision to test whether they can correct their mistakes and start anew. The government will definitely give them the opportunity to become new people again, and guarantee that no one will be wrongly killed, and no counter-revolutionary will be allowed to remain at large. (The masses are excited and applaud continuously)

Delegates, are the measures we have taken against counter-revolutionary saboteurs correct? Please give us instructions and resolutions from the representatives of the people from all walks of life so that we can earnestly implement them.

Let our people be happy! Let the counter-revolutionaries panic! (The masses shout slogans and the applause continues for a long time)
