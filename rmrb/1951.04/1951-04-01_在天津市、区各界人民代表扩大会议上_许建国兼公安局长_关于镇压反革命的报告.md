Comrades of the Presidium and People's Representatives from all walks of life:

Since the Central People's Government has repeatedly issued instructions on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the handling of counter-revolutionary criminals, it has become an important political task for all the people of Tianjin. In the past year, a detailed report on the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in Tianjin was given at the Third Session of the Second Tianjin Municipal People's Representatives Conference. After thorough discussion, the conference approved the report and made a resolution on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the future. In order to faithfully implement the resolution of the conference, and in accordance with the spirit of the Central Government's Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, we have thoroughly reviewed the backlog of cases in custody, and based on the systematic materials accumulated by the Public Security Bureau over the past two years through long-term and careful investigation, we have arrested another group of counter-revolutionaries. Among them, some are the main culprits who have consistently engaged in counter-revolutionary activities in history, and counter-revolutionaries who have not repented after being treated with leniency by the People's Government. In addition to the initial arrests of some of these main counter-revolutionaries at the beginning of liberation, the remaining group anonymously hid in our city, willingly hostile to the people, and continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, remaining at large and very rampant. In addition, some counter-revolutionaries have refused to bow their heads to the people, confess their crimes, and perform meritorious service since the promulgation of the registration method of Military Control Commission Notice No. 9. Instead, they adopted false registration, refused to register, or concealed counter-revolutionary organizations during registration, deceived the People's Government, and used "legality" as a cover to continue to carry out sabotage activities. Furthermore, the US imperialists and their running dogs, the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, rely on Hong Kong and Taiwan to train secret agents and spies, dispatching them to Tianjin to collect intelligence, steal state secrets, engage in assassination activities, and undermine national construction, endangering the safety of our people's lives and property. Our people and the people's regime are still being harassed and sabotaged by these counter-revolutionaries. This situation is intolerable to our People's Government and the two million people of Tianjin.

Recently, we have conducted a review in accordance with the spirit of the Central People's Government's Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries and the decision of the First Session of the Third Tianjin Municipal People's Representatives Conference on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities. The reasons for this are that in the past, our understanding of the policy of combining suppression with leniency formulated by Chairman Mao and the Central Committee was insufficient. The work in the past has indeed achieved great results; however, in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, there were some shortcomings and errors. That is, the suppression of the main counter-revolutionaries and those who stubbornly continued to do evil after liberation was not timely, and some were handled too slowly and too leniently. Leniency was given where it should not have been given. Some of the main culprits who committed heinous crimes and did many evils, and those who continued to carry out sabotage activities after being treated with leniency, were not resolutely and promptly suppressed. On this point, the people of Tianjin are dissatisfied with us, thus hindering the enthusiasm of the masses to fight against counter-revolutionaries, and objectively helping and encouraging the arrogance of counter-revolutionaries, enabling them to continue to remain at large and exploit our loopholes. This is our "one-sided leniency" error. Because of this error, those counter-revolutionaries who have harmed the people and committed heinous crimes have not yet received the punishment they deserve, and the hidden counter-revolutionaries have not been thoroughly purged. If these deadly dregs of society are not completely eliminated, how can the safety of the people's lives and property be guaranteed? How can the various constructions in Tianjin be carried out smoothly?

In order to implement the resolutions of the People's Representatives Conference, and in accordance with the sentencing standards stipulated in the Central Government's Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, we have recently initially screened a batch of counter-revolutionary cases that have been backlogged in the past and those currently arrested. Among them, many are counter-revolutionaries who are determined to be enemies of the people, committed heinous crimes, and should repay their debts to the people. They should be swiftly and resolutely suppressed! (Applause) These elements include Kuomintang secret agent Lü Yimin, who has been engaged in counter-revolutionary activities for more than 20 years and was the murderer of the anti-Japanese hero General Ji Hongchang. Zhu Shiyin, during the Anti-Japanese War, helped the Japanese invaders and was the murderer of the massacre of more than 1,200 people in Panjiayu. The big traitor Gao Tiehou, nicknamed Gao Yanwang, as the chief of the Beidaihe police station, slaughtered more than 60 lives of our people and cadres. Kuomintang secret agent Shen Jinggui has been engaged in counter-revolutionary activities for 21 years. Before the liberation of Baoding in 1948, he masterminded the Baoding massacre. These are all heinous counter-revolutionary main culprits with accumulated blood debts. Those who stubbornly continued counter-revolutionary activities after liberation, such as Sun Furui, Li Zhong'e, Zhou Dawen, and Yang Yimin, were all from the puppet army and held important positions in the bandit party. They assassinated our revolutionary cadres Zhao Luoyun and others, five people in total. After liberation, they colluded with Guo Yanting, a retained personnel of our Foreign Trade Bureau, to probe into state secrets and colluded with reactionary landlords to organize and collect Chiang bandit soldiers and vagrants to conspire to riot. Another example is the chief criminal of the "North China Volunteer Salvation National Corps" case, Wang Yongheng, Zhang Hongchuan, and Li Qinsheng, who fabricated a blacklist for the bandit gang in the Hebei Institute of Technology before liberation, sabotaged the student movement, and after liberation, they were led by the bandit "Pingjinji Re Investigation Office" and lurked in the school, gathering Kuomintang and Three Youth League elements in the city, engaged in counter-revolutionary activities and attempted to use hand grenades to sabotage the meeting place during the 1949 National Day. Another example is Yan Sanhe of the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, who was a Japanese spy in the past and killed many of our cadres in Shanxi. After liberation, he pretended to be active, concealed his identity, and infiltrated the Communist Party to engage in espionage and sabotage activities. Liu Lida was a Kuomintang district branch committee member and Green Gang boss who lurked in the repair shop of the Haihe Engineering Office, stuffed a one-foot-long iron rod into the electric motor, sabotaged the machine, and broke a worker's finger.

Wu Shutian, the secretary of the Chiang Kai-shek party district branch, continuously placed hand grenades in the reed chopping room of the paper mill to carry out sabotage. The secret agent Su Dian lurked in the Supply Bureau and stole the bureau's 1951 safekeeping work plan. The Kuomintang secret agents Jia Xianglin and Ou Sichun, who lurked in the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, threw four saw blades into the No. 5 cleaning machine in the opening room, and caused the motor to explode three times in a row, causing a fire and destroying seven looms. The rampant behavior of these bandits has really reached an intolerable level. Some are evil bullies and hooligans who have committed many evils, such as Wang Shijiang, one of the "Ten Evils," Wang Jiabin, Wang Jiaqi, and Wang Jiazong, one of the "Four Tyrants," and Sun Qisan, the "Eastern Tyrant," are all bullies who fly tickets, use nets, and prey on the people. Can we let them remain at large? There are also heads of feudal secret societies who engage in counter-revolutionary espionage activities. Such as Wang Ziquan and Jia Xianglin of the World New Buddhist Church, who organized the "Bagua Army" to plot a riot after liberation. Wang Jingwen, the ringleader of the Yiguandao bandits, accepted the task of the Kuomintang secret service organization, the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense, organized the Anti-Communist Volunteer Army, and attempted to riot. Such examples are too numerous to mention. These people oppose the government and intimidate the people. We cannot but arrest them, (People shout: Arrest them!) and cannot but suppress them. (People shout: Suppress them!) Is it appropriate to arrest and suppress these counter-revolutionaries? Please criticize, supervise and review our work by the representatives of the people from all walks of life, and make a decision so that it can be implemented accordingly.

After such saboteurs were arrested, the people of Tianjin were overjoyed. This can be described most appropriately in eight characters, which is "the people are happy, and the secret agents are panicked." (Applause) Since the arrest of these counter-revolutionaries, the victims have filed lawsuits one after another. They said, "The government has woken up!" "Now there is really law and heaven." Some citizens said, "These guys should have been arrested long ago!" And also said, "Why haven't some bad elements been arrested?" Since the arrest of these elements, the people believe that this is truly being the master for the people and avenging the people. Recently, the Public Security Bureau has received an average of thirty to forty letters of denunciation every day. (Applause) At the same time, it is also a very significant blow to counter-revolutionary saboteurs. (Applause) Therefore, some counter-revolutionaries have voluntarily surrendered and confessed to the public security organs. The people's awareness is increasing day by day, and the hidden secret agents will never escape the people's giant palms. (Applause) Therefore, the only way out for counter-revolutionaries is to bow their heads to the people, confess to the government, and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. Has the government's policy changed as a result? Our answer is no, the policy of combining leniency and suppression is the basic policy of the People's Government, it was so in the past, and it still is now. However, in the past period, there was a "one-sided leniency" bias in mastering and implementing it. The leniency was somewhat unbounded, that is, the main culprits and those who stubbornly continued to do evil were not suppressed in a timely manner, or the suppression was insufficient. Since the people have raised their opinions to us, we have reviewed and corrected it. What does this policy of combining leniency and suppression include?

First of all, let's talk about leniency! That is, for those who have committed serious crimes, but have now truly repented and performed meritorious service for the people; for those who were forced to participate in counter-revolutionary activities; or those whose counter-revolutionary crimes before liberation were not serious, and who have truly repented after liberation and broken ties with counter-revolutionary organizations, we have already treated these elements leniently in the past, and we will still treat them leniently now. Today is the same as in the past, and there is no change. We will release another group after screening the detainees. In the future, we will still give lenient treatment to the general reactionary elements who sincerely repent and bow their heads to the people to confess their crimes and are willing to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. Some of the supervised elements, as long as they are determined to turn back to good and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes, and are proven by the masses to have performed well, can have their supervision lifted, their civil rights restored, and be given the opportunity to become new people again. Also, leniency is extended to those who surrender and those who perform meritorious service. For those counter-revolutionary ringleaders who have committed heinous crimes, for those secret agents and spies who stubbornly continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities after liberation, for those counter-revolutionaries who have committed evil again after being treated with leniency, for those habitual bandits, bullies, hooligans, murderers, and reactionary secret society leaders who have committed serious crimes, for those unrepentant counter-revolutionaries who deserve to die, absolute leniency cannot be given (applause) and should be severely suppressed. (Applause) If we do not do so, the people's lives and property cannot be guaranteed, construction cannot be carried out smoothly, the people will suffer, and the state power cannot be consolidated. Therefore: The correct policy of combining leniency and suppression must be taken into account, and neither can be neglected. This is the wise instruction of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee.

In order to ensure the correct implementation of this policy, we have adopted a serious and cautious attitude and stipulated some specific implementation methods, which is to strengthen investigation and research, seek truth from facts, rely on evidence, and not easily believe rumors. The arrest of a criminal must go through five procedures of review. If there is any doubt about a small detail, it is better not to arrest and not allow mistakes. As for sentencing and executing criminals, more stringent procedures are adopted. Some are reviewed and approved by the Military Control Commission, the Mayor, the People's Court, and even the Central People's Court before they can be executed.

In this way, we can ensure that no good person is wronged, and no counter-revolutionary element is allowed to remain at large.

Regarding the handling of mass tip-offs and letters of denunciation, we also adopt the above-mentioned principles, never engage in careless and perfunctory actions, but conduct thorough investigation and research, and be responsible to the people with a high degree of responsibility to prevent the occurrence of framing good people or using public office for private revenge. For the past two years, we have been conscientiously implementing it under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central Committee, and our Tianjin Mayor Huang. This is the situation of our past policy implementation. Only in this way can we implement the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries.

This time, severely suppressing counter-revolutionaries is a good education for the people, making everyone clearly recognize the two-sidedness and despicable and vicious means of counter-revolutionaries. They harmed the people. Under the reactionary rule, the people dared to be angry but dared not speak out, and many people did not know about it. After liberation, they often still thought they were friends of the people. Now the crimes of these counter-revolutionaries are nakedly exposed before the people. The facts of these counter-revolutionaries' activities can also help us overcome paralysis of thought. We can learn many lessons from the Wu Cunzhu incident of the evil landlord; an evil landlord full of blood debts fled to Tianjin, using the relationship of relatives and friends as a cover to carry out counter-revolutionary activities of sabotaging production and construction and harming revolutionary cadres. From here, we can realize that if we do not raise our vigilance, do not severely suppress counter-revolutionaries, and let the enemy live on, the lives of our people will inevitably be threatened with death. Should we let the enemy live on? Or should the safety of the people's lives and property be guaranteed? Two paths must be chosen. Now we affirm that we want the people to live on and live happily. Now we have realized that although the open enemy with guns has been eliminated, the hidden enemy still wants to treat us with the most vicious means, so we must raise our vigilance, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, break personal relationships, and the people and the government unite to complete this long-term and arduous political task, thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionaries (applause), and resolutely and ruthlessly suppress counter-revolutionary activities to ensure the safety of the people's lives and property and the construction of various undertakings in the new China, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. (Prolonged applause)

In the process of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, a few people are suspicious, uneasy, and panicked. This is also inevitable. There are three different types of people among them: Due to the enemy's long-term reactionary rule and deceptive propaganda before liberation, some people have been deeply poisoned by the enemy, and after liberation, they more or less reveal some backward thinking; also, due to some shortcomings in the work style of our cadres, some people are dissatisfied, and therefore show a little antagonistic emotion, and these people are panicked. Chairman Mao has already said that this is an internal matter of our four friends and cannot be compared with counter-revolution. What is counter-revolution? It is saboteurs who have participated in counter-revolutionary organizations, have not broken away from the enemy after liberation, accept their tasks, carry out organized sabotage activities, and attempt to subvert the People's Government.

In addition, some people protect themselves wisely, are indifferent to the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and think that this is a matter for the government and the Public Security Bureau, separating the government from themselves, losing the people's position, purely "humanitarian" viewpoint, and even have the idea that they can live peacefully with counter-revolutionaries, or leave room for these counter-revolutionaries, and stand outside the front line of the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries. This passive thinking and attitude should be overcome, and everyone has the responsibility to help them correct their understanding. Tell them that revolution and counter-revolution are irreconcilable, organize them and everyone to unite and jointly suppress counter-revolutionaries.

Those who have participated in reactionary parties, groups, or general anti-espionage groups have also panicked.

The handling of the arrested counter-revolutionary criminals is the issue that everyone is most concerned about. We have received many opinions from the people, and we will definitely severely suppress those who should be suppressed according to the demands of the people. The main culprits who owe blood debts and deserve to die, the unrepentant elements, those who have consistently made counter-revolution their living in history, the habitual bandits who are deeply hated by the people for their accumulated blood debts, the bandit leaders, evil bullies, big hooligans who forcefully occupy other people's wives and dominate one side, murderers, and leaders of reactionary secret societies who plunder the people's property and kill the people and still engage in counter-revolutionary activities after registration, must be severely suppressed. (Applause from all sides) Some counter-revolutionaries whose crimes do not deserve death, but who endanger the people if placed in society, rely on imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang to rule, oppress, and persecute the people for a living, and still fantasize about the return of the US and Chiang Kai-shek today, restoring their life of oppressing and persecuting the people, they must be detained and transformed for a long time, and they must never be released to persecute the people again. (Applause) In addition, some people should be subjected to a certain period of supervision to test whether they can correct their mistakes and start anew. The government will definitely give them the opportunity to become new people again, and guarantee that no one will be wrongly killed, and no counter-revolutionary will be allowed to remain at large. (The masses are excited and applaud continuously)

Delegates, are the measures we have taken against counter-revolutionary saboteurs correct? Please give us instructions and resolutions from the representatives of the people from all walks of life so that we can earnestly implement them.

Let our people be happy! Let the counter-revolutionaries panic! (The masses shout slogans and the applause continues for a long time)

　　在天津市、区各界人民代表扩大会议上       
    许建国兼公安局长        
    关于镇压反革命的报告主席团各界人民代表同志们：
    关于镇压反革命和处置反革命罪犯问题，自中央人民政府屡次指示后，就成为我们天津市全体人民当前的一个重要政治任务了。天津市在过去的一年，关于镇压反革命的工作已在第三届第二次各界人民代表会议上作过详细的报告，经过大会切实讨论后，通过了这个报告并作出了今后镇压反革命的决议。为了忠实执行大会决议，又根据中央惩治反革命条例的精神，详细地清理了在押的积案，并根据公安局两年来积累的系统的经过长期慎密调查的材料，又逮捕了一批反革命分子。其中有一部分是在历史上一贯进行反革命的首恶分子，以及经过人民政府宽大后仍不改悔的反革命分子。这些首恶的反革命分子除在解放初期逮捕了一批外，其余一批因匿名潜藏本市甘心与人民为敌，仍继续进行反革命活动，逍遥法外，而且很猖獗。另外有一些反革命分子是自军管会第九号布告颁布登记办法以来，他们不甘心向人民低头认罪，戴罪立功；反而采取了假登记，拒绝登记或登记时隐瞒了反革命组织，欺骗人民政府，并利用“合法”掩护，仍进行破坏活动。再就是美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石残余匪帮依靠香港和台湾训练特务间谍派遣来津搜集情报窃取国家机密，搞暗害活动，破坏国家建设危害我们人民生命财产的安全，我们的人民和人民政权仍然受到这些反革命分子的骚扰和破坏。这种情况，我们人民政府和津市二百万人民，是不能容忍的。
    最近我们已根据中央人民政府颁布的惩治反革命条例和天津市第三届第一次代表会议关于镇压反革命活动的决定的精神进行了检讨，这些原因是由于过去对于执行毛主席及中央所拟定的镇压与宽大相结合的政策体会得不够。过去的工作的确有了很大成绩；可是在镇压反革命分子的工作上，存在一些缺点和错误，就是对反革命的首恶分子和解放后仍然坚决继续作恶的怙恶不悛分子镇压得不及时，有些处理太慢、太轻，不应宽大的宽大了。有些罪大恶极作恶多端的首恶分子和经过宽大后仍在进行破坏活动的分子我们没有坚决及时予以镇压。在这一点上我们天津市的人民对我们是不满的，因而妨害人民群众对反革命进行斗争的积极性，客观上助长了和鼓励了反革命的气焰，使他们能够继续逍遥法外和钻了我们的空子。这就是我们犯了“片面宽大”的错误。由于这种错误，使那些残害过人民罪大恶极的反革命分子还没有得到应有的惩罚，暗藏的反革命分子还没有彻底地肃清。这些社会中的罪该万死的渣滓，如果不把他们清除干净，人民生命财产的安全怎么能够得到保障呢？天津市的各种建设又怎么能得到顺利的进行呢？
    为了执行各界人民代表会议的决议，根据中央惩治反革命条例所规定的量刑标准，我们最近已将过去积压的和目前逮捕的反革命案件初步清理出来了一批，就中许多是坚决与人民为敌，罪大恶极的应当偿还人民血债的反革命分子，应当迅速坚决予以严厉镇压，（鼓掌）这些分子例如军统特务吕一民，从事反革命活动二十余年，是捕杀抗日英雄吉鸿昌将军的凶手。朱世荫抗日期间曾帮凶日寇，造成潘家峪烧死一千二百余人大血案的凶手。大汉奸高铁侯外号高阎王，任北戴河警察所长时，屠杀我人民及干部前后达六十多条人命，军统特务沈景桂从事反革命二十一年，保定解放前一九四八年，主谋制造了保定大屠杀惨案，这些都是血债累累，罪恶滔天的反革命首恶分子。解放后怙恶不悛，仍然继续反革命活动的，例如孙福锐、李仲锷、周大文、杨逸民等都是伪军出身，历任匪党要职，曾暗杀我革命干部赵洛云等五人，解放后拉拢我对外贸易局留用人员郭晏廷刺探国家机密，勾结反动地主组织搜罗蒋匪散兵游勇阴谋暴动。又如“华北区义勇救国纵队”案主犯王永恒、张鸿川、李琴声，解放前在河北工学院校内为匪帮制造黑名单，破坏学生运动，解放后受匪“平津冀热调查处”领导潜伏该校内，纠合本市中统及三青团分子，进行反革命活动并企图于一九四九年国庆节时，用手榴弹破坏会场。又如棉纺一厂阎三贺，过去是日寇特务，曾在山西杀害我干部多人，解放后伪装积极，隐瞒身份，混入共产党内进行奸细破坏活动。刘礼达是蒋党区分部委员、青帮头子，潜藏海河工程处修理厂内，将一尺长的铁棍塞入电动机内，破坏机器，打断工人手指。
    蒋党区分部书记吴树田，连续在造纸厂铡苇室放置手榴弹进行破坏，特务苏迪安，潜伏在供应局内窃取了该局一九五一年保管工作计划，潜伏在棉纺一厂的中统特务贾祥麟、欧司春等将锯条四片投入清花间五号车清花机内，并连续三次使马达爆炸引起火灾，毁掉织布机七台。这些匪徒的猖獗，实在达到难以容忍的程度了。有些是作恶多端的恶霸流氓，如“十大恶”之一王士姜，“四霸天”之一王嘉宾、王嘉祺、王嘉宗，“东霸天”孙起三都是飞帖打网，鱼肉人民的恶霸，我们能让他们逍遥法外么？还有些是利用封建会门进行反革命特务活动的头子。如世界新佛教会的王紫泉、贾祥麟等解放后组织“八卦军”阴谋暴动，一贯道匪首王景文接受蒋匪特务组织国防部二厅的任务，组织反共义勇军，企图暴动。这样的例子举不胜举。这些人反对政府，恫吓人民，我们不能不予逮捕，（群众呼声：要逮捕）不能不予镇压。（群众呼声：要镇压）对这些反革命分子的逮捕镇压是否妥当呢？请各界人民代表对我们的工作予以批评监督和审查，作成决定，以便依照执行。
    像这样的破坏分子被逮捕了以后，天津市的人民欢喜若狂，这可以用八个字来形容最为恰当，就是“人心称快，特务恐慌”，（鼓掌）自这些反革命分子逮捕后被害者纷纷控诉，他们说：“政府睡醒了！”“现在才真正是有法有天”，有些市民说：“这些家伙早就该逮捕了！”并且还说：“有些坏分子为什么不逮捕”。自这些分子逮捕之后，人民认为这才是为民作主替人民报仇雪恨了。最近公安局每天平均要收到三、四十封检举信。（鼓掌）同时也是对反革命破坏分子一个很重大的打击。（鼓掌）因此有些反革命分子自动向公安机关自首坦白。群众觉悟一天天提高，隐藏的特务分子绝逃不出人民的巨掌。（鼓掌）所以反革命分子的唯一出路就是向人民低头，向政府坦白，戴罪立功。这样一来政府的政策是否变了呢？我们回答是没有变，宽大与镇压相结合的政策，这是人民政府的基本政策，过去是这样，现在还是这样。不过在过去一个时期内，在掌握执行上发生了“片面宽大”的偏向，在宽大方面有点无边，就是对于首恶分子，怙恶不悛分子该镇压的没有及时镇压，或镇压不够，自从人民对我们提出意见之后，我们就检讨了和纠正了。这种宽大与镇压政策包括些什么内容呢？
    首先讲宽大吧！就是对于那些虽然有过严重罪行，而现在确已真诚悔改，并为人民立功的分子；对于那些曾经被迫参加反革命的胁从分子；或者解放前反革命罪行并不重大，解放后又确已悔改，并与反革命组织断绝联系的分子，这些分子过去我们已经对他们宽大处理了，现在还是对他们宽大处理，今天和过去仍是一样的对待，并无改变。我们在被押人犯中经过清理后还要释放一批，今后诚心悔改并向人民低头认罪，愿对人民戴罪立功的一般反动分子，我们还是要给他们宽大待遇的。有些被管制分子只要他们立下决心回头向善立功赎罪，经过群众证明表现良好者，即可解除管制，恢复公民权，予以重做新人的机会。还加上对自首分子，立功分子的宽大。对于那些罪大恶极的反革命首要分子，对于那些在解放后怙恶不悛继续进行反革命活动的特务间谍分子，对于那些经过宽大后又再作恶的反革命分子，对于罪恶严重的惯匪、恶霸、流氓、杀人犯、反动会门头子，对于那些死有余辜的不可救药的反革命分子，是绝对不能宽大的，（鼓掌）是应该严厉予以镇压的。（鼓掌）如果不这样作，人民生命财产不能得到保障，建设不能顺利进行，人民就要遭殃，国家政权就不能得到巩固。因此：宽大与镇压相结合的正确政策，必须兼顾，二者不可偏废。这是毛主席和中央英明的指示。
    为了保证这个政策的正确执行，我们又采取严肃谨慎的态度，规定了一些具体执行办法，这就是加强调查研究实事求是依靠证据不轻信传言。在逮捕一个人犯要经过五道手续的审查，如果对某一个小节发生怀疑时，宁可不捕不许弄错，至于判刑与处决人犯时，采取了更严格的手续，有些经过军管会、市长、人民法院，甚至中央人民法院审查与批准方能执行。
    这样既能保障不冤枉一个好人，也不放松一个反革命分子，使之逍遥法外。
    对于群众告密与检举信的处理问题，我们也是采取上述的原则，绝不粗枝大叶的草率从事，而是经过周密的调查研究，并以高度的责任心向人民负责，防止诬害好人或公报私仇现象发生。我们两年来都是在毛主席、中央和我们天津市黄市长的正确领导下兢兢业业认真执行的。这就是我们过去执行政策的情况。只有这样我们才能贯彻执行惩治反革命条例。
    这一次严厉镇压反革命分子对人民是一个很好的教育，使大家清楚地认识到反革命分子的两面性和卑鄙毒辣的手段。他们残害了人民，在反动统治之下，人民敢怒不敢言，还有好多人不知道；解放了之后往往还认为他们是人民的朋友。现在这些反革命分子的罪恶都赤裸裸地暴露在人民眼前了。这些反革命分子活动事实，也可以帮助我们克服麻痹思想，从恶霸地主吴存卓事件我们就可以得到许多教训；一个满身血债的恶霸地主逃到天津，借亲戚朋友的关系作掩护，进行破坏生产建设，残害革命干部的反革命活动。从这里我们可以认识到如果不提高警惕，不严厉镇压反革命，让敌人活下去，我们人民的生命就必然要遭到死亡的威胁。还是让敌人活下去呢？还是让人民生命财产得到安全保障呢？两条路必须选择一条。现在我们肯定的说：要让人民活下去，要让人民幸福地活下去。现在我们已经认识到：公开的拿枪的敌人虽然已经消灭，但是暗藏的敌人仍旧想用最凶狠的手段来对待我们，所以我们要提高警惕，分清敌我，打破私人情面，人民和政府团结一致来完成这个长期艰巨的政治任务，彻底肃清反革命分子，（鼓掌）坚决无情地镇压反革命活动，以保障人民生命财产的安全和新中国的各种事业建设，巩固人民民主专政。（掌声不绝）
    在镇压反革命过程中，有少数人怀疑不安，发生恐慌。这也是必然的。其中有三种人是不相同的：由于解放前敌人长期的反动统治和欺骗宣传，使一些人受到敌人的毒害很深，解放后或多或少地流露些落后思想的表现；又由于我们干部作风上存在着某些缺点，使得一些人心怀不满，因而表现了一点对抗情绪，这些人就恐慌起来了。关于这个问题毛主席已经说过，这是我们四个朋友内部的事情，不能与反革命相提并论。什么是反革命呢？就是参加过反革命组织，解放后还未与敌人脱离关系，接受其任务进行有组织的破坏活动，企图颠覆人民政府的破坏分子。
    另外还有一些人明哲保身，对镇压反革命漠不关心，认为这是政府和公安局的事，把政府和自己区分开，失去人民的立场，单纯“人道”观点，甚而存在可以与反革命分子和平共居的思想，或者对这些反革命分子留有余地，而置身于镇压反革命斗争战线之外。这种消极思想和态度应当加以克服，大家都有责任帮助他们纠正认识。告诉他们革命与反革命是誓不两立的，组织他们和大家团结一体共同镇压反革命。
    对于那些曾经参加过反动的党团或一般防奸小组的分子，也发生了恐慌。
    对于已逮捕的反革命罪犯的处理是大家最关心的问题，我们收到很多人民的意见，我们一定根据人民的要求，对应该镇压的严予镇压。对那些血债累累的罪该万死的首恶分子，怙恶不悛分子，历史上一贯以反革命为生，血债累累为人民深恶痛绝的惯匪，匪首恶霸，强占人妻霸占一方的大流氓杀人犯，以及抢掠人民财产，杀害人民经登记后仍进行反革命活动的反动会门头子，必须严予镇压。（掌声四起）有些罪不该死，放在社会上又危害人民的反革命分子依靠帝国主义、国民党匪帮统治，压榨迫害人民为生，直到今天还在幻想美蒋重来，恢复他们压榨迫害人民的生活，对他们必须长期关押改造，决不能释放他们出来再去迫害人民。（掌声）另外一些人要予以一定时期的管制，考验他们是否能够改过自新。政府绝对给予重做新人的机会，保证绝不错杀一个人，也绝不让一个反革命分子逍遥法外。（群众振奋掌声不绝）
    各位代表们，我们对反革命破坏分子采取了这样的一些措施，是不是做得对呢？请各界人民代表给我们以指示和公决，以便认真执行。
    让我们人民高兴吧！反革命分子恐慌吧！（群众高呼口号掌声历久不绝）
