　　Yenching University Students Should Value Physical Education
    Yanjing University Correspondence Group
    Yenching University has very complete sports facilities: there are separate gymnasiums for men and women, basketball courts, tennis courts, and a football field; there are also all kinds of sports equipment for track and field, ball games, and gymnastics. After exercising, everyone can enjoy a refreshing warm bath. Although Yenching University has such good conditions for physical exercise, students rarely take advantage of them.
    Every day from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM is the opening time of the gymnasium, but according to imprecise statistics: the number of male students who regularly come to exercise is only sixty or seventy, less than one-tenth of the total number of male students in the university. The number of female students participating in sports is even more pitiful. The women's gymnasium is often deserted during free activity time.
    Some students use the excuse of "insufficient nutrition, more exercise is harmful to the body" and are unwilling to enter the stadium; when attending physical education classes, they impatiently wait for the bell to ring. In fact, the nutritional situation of Yenching students is not bad: male students now eat steamed buns and white rice, and can eat 1.5 to 2.5 liang of pork every day; female students eat even better. Dr. Wu of the Health Office and Mr. Yan Huatang, a physical education teacher, have both said: "The nutrition that students now receive is much better than the lives of the vast majority of Chinese farmers."
    Some students also say: "We are already too busy with schoolwork, how can we have time to exercise?" They believe that "study is first, health is second." This statement is incorrect. To serve the people, a healthy body is needed first. Is the coursework at Yenching University really that busy? Not really. Since the beginning of the autumn semester last year, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Education, courses have been streamlined to make students' study time no more than 55 hours per week as much as possible. Students in departments such as mechanical engineering, which are known for their busy coursework, spend less than 50 hours per week studying after making a study plan. Other students in the liberal arts colleges, whose coursework is relatively light, have ample time to exercise.
    Some students also feel that it is impossible to improve their health in college. They think that playing ball and racing are just things for middle school and elementary school students. The phenomenon of female students not paying attention to exercise is even more serious. It is already rare to find someone who can play badminton a few times a week outside of class.
    A few students, because of poor health, feel: "Why should I exercise with such a bad body? It's good enough if I don't get sick!" Therefore, they never dare to try exercise easily.
    The Communist Party members and Youth League members in the school, especially the general cadres, often neglect physical exercise because of their busy work.
    It can be seen that the main reason why Yenching University students lack exercise is neither "insufficient nutrition" nor "too busy with coursework." The fundamental reason is a problem of thinking. They do not regard physical education as part of their studies, but as a "burden."
    The Physical Education Department of Yenching University has noticed this problem and is preparing to cooperate with the Student Union to hold various sports competitions to increase students' interest in sports, and hopes to encourage students to value physical education and actively participate in sports activities through administrative and Student Union appeals, through big-character posters and school newspapers.

　　燕京大学同学应重视体育
    燕京大学通讯组
    燕京大学有着很完备的体育设备：有男女体育馆各一座，有篮球场、网球场和足球场；田径、球类、技巧等各式运动器具也样样俱全。在运动之后，大家又可以爽爽快快地洗一个温水浴。虽然燕京大学有着这样好的锻炼身体的条件，但同学们却很少去利用它。
    每天下午四时到六时，是体育馆开放的时间，但据不精确的统计：男同学经常来运动的不过六、七十人，不足全校男同学总人数的十分之一。参加运动的女同学更少得可怜，女体育馆在自由活动的时间内，常是冷清清的。
    有些同学以“营养不足，多运动对身体有害”为借口，不愿意进体育场；上体育课时，不耐烦地等着下课钟响。其实，燕京同学的营养情况是不算坏的：男生现在吃的是馒头和白米饭，每天还可以吃到一两半到二两半的猪肉；女生吃得更好。卫生处吴大夫和体育教员阎华棠先生都曾说过：“同学们现在所得到的营养比起一般中国广大的农民生活已经好得多了。”
    也有些同学说：“功课已经忙不过来了，还有时间运动吗？”他们认为“学习第一，身体第二”。这种说法是不对的。要为人民服务，首先需要健康的身体。燕京大学的功课真的忙吗？并不尽然。自去年秋季开学以后，遵照教育部的指示，精简了课程，尽可能使同学们的学习时间每周不超过五十五小时。素称功课繁忙的机械等系同学，订了学习计划以后，每周的学习时间还不到五十小时。其他文法学院各系功课比较轻的同学，更有着充足的时间可以运动。
    又有一些同学觉得，到了大学身体是锻炼不好的了。他们认为打球、赛跑不过是中学生和小学生的玩意儿。女同学们不注意运动的现象更是严重，每星期能在课外打几次羽毛球的已经很难得了。
    少数同学因身体不好，便觉得：“我这样坏的身体还要运动吗？能不生病就蛮好了！”因此对于运动就从来不敢轻易尝试。
    学校里的共产党员、青年团员，尤其是一般干部，常由于工作比较繁忙，忽略了身体的锻炼。
    由此可见，燕大同学缺少运动的主要原因，既不在“营养不足”，又不在“功课太忙”，根本原因是一个思想问题。他们不将体育看作学习的一部分，而把它视作一种“负担”。
    燕京大学体育部已经注意到这一个问题，准备与学生会合作举办各项运动比赛，提高同学们的运动兴趣，并希望通过行政和学生会的号召，通过大字报和校刊，鼓励同学们重视体育，积极参加体育活动。
