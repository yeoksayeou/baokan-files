Father Li Depei's Speech

Esteemed guests, priests, and fellow Catholics:

　　Since the liberation of the Chinese people, the construction of New China has been advancing by leaps and bounds. China is indeed lovable, and all Chinese Catholics at this time should do their best to remove all obstacles in the construction of the motherland, cast aside all misgivings, and wholeheartedly love our great motherland. The Common Program clearly stipulates freedom of religious belief, which makes us Catholics grateful and excited. Our Catholic Church is inherently holy, but in the last hundred years, since the Opium War, imperialism has consistently used religion as a cover to carry out its activities of aggression against the Chinese people, not only using guns and cannons to kill Chinese people, but also sending some people to lurk within the religion, engaging in espionage activities that kill without shedding blood. Such facts are conspicuous throughout modern history, and recent reports in newspapers about the cracking of espionage cases within the Catholic Church illustrate this point. This has brought immense shame to our pure church.

　　It was precisely at this critical moment for our church that the Tianjin Catholic Church Reform Movement Promotion Association was established. Its positive significance lies in washing away the stains imperialism has imposed on the church, maintaining the purity of the church, and implementing the Three-Self principles as the basic goal. Our actions are just, and after our declaration of self-reliance and reform was published, the broad masses of Catholics responded enthusiastically. Although imperialist elements tried every means to obstruct our patriotic movement, saying that signing was a sin, threatening patriotic and church-loving Catholics with "deprivation of power," stopping "spiritual merits," and "going to hell," the Promotion Association was not afraid of difficulties and overcame all obstacles, achieving today's great achievements. All Chinese priests in the city's churches have signed, and 15,000 of the more than 20,000 Catholics have signed. However, just as American imperialism is expanding its aggression in Korea, threatening the security of our motherland, the special agents lurking in the church will continue their activities of harming the Chinese people. Therefore, we must strengthen our vigilance, smash the aggressive conspiracies of the United States and its running dogs, expose all imperialist elements within the church, and promote our reform movement from cities to villages, throughout North China, throughout the country, and throughout the world.

### 李德培神甫讲话

　　李德培神甫讲话各位来宾、神甫、教友们：
    中国人民解放以后，新中国的各项建设事业都是在突飞猛进中。中国的确是可爱的，全中国教徒在这时都应该尽力铲除一切在祖国建设中的障碍，抛除一切顾虑，全心全意爱我们伟大的祖国。在共同纲领上，明确规定了有信教的自由，使我们教徒感激而兴奋。我们天主教本是圣洁的，但近百年来，自鸦片战争以后，帝国主义一贯以宗教为掩护，进行其侵略中国人民的活动，不但用枪炮杀害中国人民，而且派遣了一些人潜伏在宗教内，作着杀人不见血的间谍勾当。这类事实远的在近代史上触目皆是，近的如报纸上登载的在天主教内破获的间谍案都说明了这一点。使我们纯洁的教会蒙受了莫大的羞辱。
    正是在我们教会危急的时候，天津市天主教革新运动促进会成立了。它的积极意义就是洗雪帝国主义所加于教会的污点，保持教会的纯洁，以实行三自为基本目的。我们的行动是正义的，当我们的自立革新宣言发表后，广大教徒即群起响应，其间虽有帝国主义分子千方百计的阻挠我们爱国运动，说签名有罪，拿“摘权”停止“神功”、“下地狱”来威胁爱国爱教的教友。但促进会不怕艰难，排除了一切困难，已经有了今天的广大成就。全市各教堂中国神甫已经签名，二万多教友中已有一万五千名教友签名。但是正当美帝国主义扩大侵略朝鲜，威胁着我们祖国的安全，潜伏在教会内的特务也就会继续其残害中国人民的活动，所以我们必须加强警惕，粉碎美国及其走狗的侵略阴谋，把教内所有的帝国主义分子检举出来，把我们的革新运动从城市中推展到乡村、全华北，推展到全国至全世界。
