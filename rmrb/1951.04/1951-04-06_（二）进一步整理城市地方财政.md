(II) Further Rectification of Urban Local Finance

The State Council of the Central People's Government approved and promulgated on March 31 the "Decision on Further Rectifying Urban Local Finance" (the Decision is on page 2 of today's newspaper). This decision, based on the current situation of urban financial work, stipulates the path for further rectifying urban local finance, which is a major event related to urban construction and the welfare of urban people in the future.

As is well known, since last year, under the support of the people of the whole country, the Central People's Government has unified the management and leadership of national financial work, stabilized finance and prices, and laid a preliminary but solid foundation for achieving a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation. At the same time, preliminary rectification work has also been carried out in urban local finance across the country. The phenomenon of chaotic revenue and expenditure in urban finance has largely disappeared, and various cities have gained preliminary work experience in managing urban finance. This provides the possibility for further rectifying urban local finance this year.

According to more than a year of experience, it has been proven that urban local finance is very different from county local finance, which is based on rural areas. Generally speaking, the current urban finance has the following characteristics: First, cities used to be the centers of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, and many cities were occupied by Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War. For a long time, there was only destruction and little or no basic construction. The serious problems commonly existing in various cities now are: sewers, water pipes, roads, rivers, and houses have been in disrepair for many years, hospital beds are insufficient, fire-fighting equipment is inadequate, there are too few public toilets, and too many out-of-school children, and so on. It is estimated that the silt accumulated in the rivers in Shanghai alone will take three years to completely dredge. Taking housing in Beijing as an example, more than 9,000 rooms collapsed during the rainy season last year. Although the People's Government has carried out various arduous tasks to solve these problems in the past year, a comprehensive solution to these problems will require a longer period, and the resulting financial burden is very huge. Second, the urban population is concentrated, and the urban people's requirements for food, clothing, housing, and transportation are different from those of rural residents. It is not acceptable to have no hospitals or fire-fighting equipment in cities. It is also unacceptable to have no public toilets or public transportation. If there is a problem with the water pipes, the citizens will have no water to drink. The city's demand for solving the problem of out-of-school children is also more urgent than in rural areas. In short, many things that are not problems or are minor problems in rural areas are major problems in cities. If these problems are not handled properly, they will have a great impact on the lives of urban people. Third, urban people have a higher ability to bear burdens. The government can ask the people for more money to do things, especially for things that are urgently needed by citizens, such as urban transportation, health and safety equipment, and the shelter of beggars. If citizens are willing to pay and ask the government to do things, the government should accept the citizens' demands. In this case, the government should adopt the financial principle of determining expenditure based on revenue, instead of adhering to the policy of "determining expenditure based on income." Fourth, cities have many favorable conditions for developing industry. Therefore, in urban financial work, we must also put the income of municipal enterprises in a certain position. Northeast experience has proven that the income of municipal enterprises is not only more reliable and promising than tax revenue, but also an indispensable part of developing urban production and cooperating with national economic construction. It is very clear that these characteristics must be considered when we study the issue of urban financial management in the future.

In the "Decision on Further Rectifying Urban Local Finance" approved and promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government, it is pointed out that the principle for balancing revenue and expenditure in urban local finance in the future should be "striving to organize revenue based on the undertakings that must be carried out locally and the people's ability to bear burdens, guaranteeing necessary expenditures, and opposing extravagance and waste." This means that urban local finance can only carry out certain undertakings that must be carried out locally based on its own financial resources, instead of undertaking everything at once. We cannot completely restore and build cities that have suffered long-term destruction by the Kuomintang reactionary government and Japanese invaders overnight. On the other hand, urban local finance should not only adopt a passive policy of "determining expenditure based on income." We must also actively organize revenue within the scope of the people's ability to bear burdens to ensure necessary expenditures and meet the demands of urban people. This is the direction of urban financial work that both conforms to the current national financial situation and the characteristics of urban financial work.

According to this policy, it is not difficult to understand that urban financial work should and already has the conditions to change from supply finance to construction finance to adapt to the economic situation of cities. The so-called construction finance means that it is not enough to only take care of food and clothing. The finances should actively pay for the undertakings that must be carried out and the necessary and reasonable expenditures. Secondly, it should not be simply "asking from above and distributing below," or "asking for more from above and distributing less below," but should actively organize the city's revenue. Thirdly, it should not only think of ways in terms of taxes, surcharges, and regulatory fees, but should also strive to organize municipal enterprises so as to gradually solve the city's financial problems from production income. Only by doing so can we further improve the work of urban local finance.

It must be pointed out here that, because most cities do not yet have a production base for municipal enterprises, and the few cities that already have a production base can only use enterprise income to continue to expand production, it is not yet possible to rely on municipal enterprise income to solve the current urgent local financial needs. Therefore, urban local tax revenue not only in the past but also in the future certain period will still have to be a major source of solving urban local financial expenditures. In the past, urban local tax revenue mainly relied on tax surcharges, among which the most common was the industrial and commercial tax surcharge, followed by the transaction tax surcharge, slaughter tax surcharge, entertainment tax surcharge, etc. Individual cities in North China had stopped the tax surcharges and collected political and educational undertakings fees. In order to solve the needs of urban local finance and unify the scope of collection, it was decided to retain tax surcharges and stop collecting political and educational undertakings fees. Among the tax surcharges, it was also decided that in the future, various cities will only surcharge the industrial and commercial tax. Other surcharges such as transaction, slaughter, and entertainment taxes will be stopped. Only the business tax, income tax, and temporary business tax will be surcharged in the industrial and commercial tax, and the peddler tax will not be surcharged. This is very appropriate.

On the other hand, the situations in various cities are not entirely the same. The historical conditions, the order of liberation, and the people's burden habits of various cities are all closely related to local financial income. Therefore, in rectifying local finance, it is also very necessary to give various cities a certain degree of flexibility so that they can adapt to local conditions. In the "Decision on Further Rectifying Urban Local Finance" approved and promulgated by the State Council, in addition to uniformly stipulating that urban local financial income is divided into eight types, the collection standards or collection details are slightly flexible. For example, the industrial and commercial surcharge rate is currently 10% at the lowest and 25% at the highest in various cities. After rectification, it is stipulated to be 10% to 15%. The real estate tax surcharge rate is stipulated to be no more than 20%, while the public utility surcharge and regulatory fee income are not uniformly stipulated due to different local burden habits. However, all new income in various cities must be approved by the municipal people's representative bodies, and those that have a greater impact on the people's burden must be reported to the higher-level government for approval before implementation. All these regulations show that the government, on the one hand, takes into account the different situations in various cities. In order to take care of the urban people's requirements for urban construction and to encourage local efforts to increase revenue, the state should not restrict the organization of urban financial income too strictly so that the localities can adapt to local conditions. On the other hand, the flexibility should not be too broad to avoid excessive taxation. It is very clear that these principles are completely correct.

Since the liberation of various cities, urban financial work has achieved remarkable results under the leadership of the People's Government. This decision of the State Council has further clarified the direction of urban financial work in the future. We believe that urban financial work will continue to play a greater role in the restoration and construction of cities with the cooperation of the people in various cities.

### （二）进一步整理城市地方财政

　　（二）进一步整理城市地方财政
    中央人民政府政务院三月三十一日批准公布了关于进一步整理城市地方财政的决定（决定见今天本报第二版）。这个决定根据目前城市财政工作情况，规定了进一步整理城市地方财政的道路，这是关系今后城市建设与城市人民福利的一件大事。
    如所周知，去年以来，中央人民政府在全国人民拥护之下，统一了全国财政工作的管理与领导，稳定了金融物价，为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转奠定了初步的但是稳固的基础。与此同时，全国城市地方财政也进行了初步的整理工作，城市财政乱收乱支的现象，现在大体上已经没有了，各城市并获得了初步管理城市财政的工作经验。这样便提供了今年进一步整理城市地方财政的可能性。
    根据一年多来的经验，证明城市地方财政是与农村为基础的县地方财政有很大区别的。一般地说，现在的城市财政有以下几个特点：第一，城市过去曾是国民党反动统治的中心，抗日战争时期许多城市都被日寇占领过，长期间内只有破坏，没有或很少基本建设。现在各城市普遍存在着的严重问题是：下水道、自来水管、马路、河道和房屋等多年失修，医院病床不够，消防设备不足，公共厕所太少，失学儿童太多等等。仅上海市内各河道积存的污泥，据估计即须三年才能挖尽。房屋问题，以北京为例，去年雨季即垮了九千余间。人民政府为了解决这些问题，一年以来虽曾进行了各种艰苦工作，但全面解决这些问题，还须一个较长的时期，而且因此而来的财政负担是很巨大的。第二、城市人口集中，城市人民衣食住行各方面的要求，都与农村的居民不同。城市中没有医院、没有消防设备就不行。没有公共厕所、公共交通工具也不行。自来水管出了问题，市民就没有水吃。城市对于解决儿童失学问题的要求，也比农村更为迫切。总之，许多在农村不成问题或问题不大的事情，在城市都是重大的问题。对于这些问题如果处理不当，对城市人民生活影响很大。第三、城市人民负担能力较高，政府为了办事可以向人民多要点钱，特别是某些为市民迫切需要的事情，如市内交通、卫生与安全设备以及收容乞丐等，如果市民乐意出钱，要政府办事，政府是应当接受市民要求的。在这种情况下，政府应当采取量出为入的财政原则，而不应当坚持“量入为出”的方针。第四、城市有发展工业的许多便利条件。因此，在城市财政工作中，我们还须把组织市营企业收入放在一定的位置上。东北经验证明，市营企业收入，不仅远较税收可靠，有前途，而且也是发展城市生产，配合国家经济建设不可缺少的部分。十分显然，这些特点，在我们研究今后城市财政管理问题时，都是必须加以考虑的。
    中央人民政府政务院批准公布的“关于进一步整理城市地方财政的决定”一文中，指出今后城市地方财政平衡收支的原则，应当是“根据当地必须举办的事业与人民负担能力，努力组织收入，保证必要支出，反对铺张浪费”。这就是说，城市地方财政一方面只能根据自己的财力，举办某些当地必须举办的事业，而不是百废俱举。饱受国民党反动政府及日寇长期破坏了的城市，我们不可能在一个早上就全部恢复和建设起来。另一方面，城市地方财政也不应只是消极的“量入为出”的方针，我们还须在人民负担能力范围内，积极组织收入，以保证必要支出，满足城市人民要求。这就是既符合当前国家财政情况，又符合城市财政工作特点的城市地方财政的工作方向。
    根据这样的方针，不难理解，今后城市财政工作，应当而且已经有条件改变供给财政为建设财政，以适应城市的经济情况。所谓建设财政，就是不能以只管穿衣吃饭就了事。对于必须举办的事业与必要的、合理的开支，财政上应该主动支付。其次，不能只是简单地“向上要，向下发”，或者是“向上多要，向下少发”，而应当去积极组织市的收入。第三，不能只在税收、附加、规费等方面想办法，更应努力去组织市营企业，以便逐步从生产收入中解决市财政问题，只有这样做去，才是进一步做好城市地方财政工作的正确道路。
    这里必须指出，由于目前大部分城市尚无市营企业生产基础，少数已有生产基础的城市，目前也只能以企业收入来继续扩大生产，还不可能依靠市营企业收入解决当前急迫的地方财政需要。因此，城市地方税收不仅在过去且在将来一定的时期内，仍不得不作为解决城市地方财政开支的一个主要来源。而城市地方税收，过去各城市又是主要地依靠税收附加，其中最普遍的是工商业税附加，其次尚有交易税附加，屠宰税附加，娱乐税附加等等，华北个别城市曾停止了税收附加，收征政教事业费。为解决城市地方财政需要，并统一征收范围起见，因而决定保留税收附加，停征政教事业费。在税收附加中，又决定各城市今后只在工商业税上附加，其他如交易、屠宰、娱乐等税的附加，则停止征收。工商业税中也只在营业税、所得税、临时商业税上附加，摊贩业税不附加，这是十分恰当的。
    另方面，各城市的情况不尽一致。各城市的历史条件，解放先后，以及人民负担习惯等，都与地方财政收入有密切关系，因而在整理地方财政中，给各城市以一定程度的机动范围，以便各城市因地制宜，也十分必要。在政务院批准公布的“关于进一步整理城市地方财政的决定”中，除将城市地方财政收入统一规定为八种外，至征收标准或征收细目则分别作了稍有弹性的规定，例如工商业附加比率，各城市现行者，最低是百分之十，最高百分之二十五，经整理规定为百分之十至百分之十五。房地产税附加比率，规定最高不得超过百分之二十，而公用事业附加及规费收入，则因各地负担习惯不同，未作统一规定。但各城市凡属新增的收入，均须经过市人民代表机关通过，其中对人民负担关系较大的，并须报经上级政府批准施行。所有这些规定，说明政府一方面考虑到各城市的不同情况，为了照顾城市人民对于建设城市的要求与奖励地方积极开源起见，在城市财政组织收入上，国家不宜限制太严，以便地方能够因地制宜，但另一方面也不能把弹性放得过宽，以免发生苛扰。十分明显，这些原则，是完全正确的。
    各城市解放以来，城市财政工作在人民政府的领导之下，已获得显著的成绩，政务院这个决定，更加明确了今后城市财政工作的努力方向。我们相信，城市财政工作必将继续在各城市人民的协力合作之下，对于城市的恢复与建设，发挥更大的作用。
