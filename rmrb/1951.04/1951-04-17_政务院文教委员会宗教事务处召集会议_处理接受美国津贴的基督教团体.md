　　Religious Affairs Office of the Government Administration Council's Cultural and Educational Committee Convenes Meeting
    Handling Christian Groups Receiving American Subsidies
    Deputy Director Lu Dingyi calls on Christians nationwide to universally and deeply promote the Three-Self Reform Movement, thoroughly severing all ties with imperialism.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 16th] The meeting convened by the Religious Affairs Office of the Government Administration Council's Cultural and Educational Committee to handle Christian groups receiving American subsidies opened in Beijing on the 16th. The representatives attending the meeting included 151 representatives from Christian national, regional, local groups, and individuals. The conference elected Shao Quanlin, He Chengxiang, Xu Ying, Zhou Lixing, Wu Yaozong, Zheng Hefu, Chen Chonggui, Zhao Zichen, Chen Jianzhen, Tu Yuqing, Deng Yuzhi, Liu Liangmo, Xiao Guogui, Wang Zizhong, Jia Yuming, Wei Zhuomin and other thirty-two people to the presidium. First, Shao Quanlin, Deputy Secretary-General of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, delivered the opening speech. He said: This meeting is based on the "Decision on Handling Cultural, Educational, and Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Receiving American Subsidies" issued by the Government Administration Council on December 29, 1950, and the principle proposed by Vice Premier Guo Moruo in his report, "Chinese religious groups receiving American subsidies should be transformed into groups completely self-managed by Chinese Christians, and the government should encourage their self-reliance, self-support, and self-propagation movement." The task of the meeting is to completely sever all ties between Chinese Christianity and American imperialism and to assist patriotic Christians in promoting the Three-Self Reform Movement to realize the decision of the Government Administration Council. He pointed out that Christians nationwide should, on the basis of patriotism, draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves and cooperate with the patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to thoroughly resolve this issue.
    Lu Dingyi, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee, gave a report to the conference. He first pointed out that the unity of patriotic Christians and the people's government led by the Communist Party has a solid political foundation, which is the Common Program adopted by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He said: Since the vast majority of Christians love the motherland, since there is a lovable people's motherland, and since there is a common political foundation of the Common Program, it is entirely possible for Christians to unite with the People's Government and, under the guidance of the government, eliminate all imperialist aggressive influences. Deputy Director Lu then historically exposed the consistent criminal activities of American imperialism using Christianity for aggression. He further pointed out that since World War II, American imperialism has also gained a monopoly on the international missionary activities of Christianity, organizing the "World Council of Churches" and using Christianity as a tool for its global aggression. The conspiracy of American imperialism to use religion for cultural aggression in China has continued until recently. The July issue of the Shanghai China Christian General Association's journal last year published the "Reply from the China Committee of the North American Missionary Society Federation to Certain Christians in China." This letter exposed the association's attempt to buy off certain Christian churches in China with monetary inducements and undermine the Chinese Three-Self Reform Movement. Patriotic Chinese Christians should heighten their vigilance against such conspiracies and tricks of American imperialism. Deputy Director Lu finally called on Christians nationwide to actively support and participate in the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and to universally and deeply carry out the Three-Self Reform Movement, completely severing all ties with imperialism.
    Xie Juezai, Minister of the Interior of the Central People's Government, was invited to speak at the conference. He hoped that this meeting would thoroughly settle the accounts of imperialism's crimes of using religion to invade China, and he encouraged all Christians to overcome difficulties, actively launch the self-reliance and reform movement, and embark on a bright future.
    Wu Yaozong, Chen Chonggui, Chen Jianzhen, Wei Zhuomin, Tu Yuqing, Zheng Jianye, Wang Zizhong and other seven representatives spoke. Wu Yaozong put forward three points in his speech: (1) Expand the signature campaign for the "Ways in which Chinese Christianity Can Strive in the Construction of New China" declaration, (2) Vigorously call on Christians nationwide to participate in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, (3) Denounce the crimes of imperialism using religion for aggression, and strive to carry out political study to enhance their political understanding. The speeches of the other six representatives were filled with gratitude to the People's Government. They unanimously expressed their determination to sever all ties with imperialism and demanded that the crimes of imperialism using Christianity for destructive activities be denounced, and to struggle for the realization of the Three-Self Reform of Chinese Christianity.
    The conference heard Wu Yaozong's summary report on the Christian Reform Movement over the past eight months and Deputy Secretary-General Shao Quanlin's report on the "Draft Measures for Handling Christian Groups Receiving American Subsidies." After being discussed and approved by this conference, the handling measures will be submitted by the Cultural and Educational Committee to the Government Administration Council for approval and implementation.

　　政务院文教委员会宗教事务处召集会议
    处理接受美国津贴的基督教团体
    陆定一副主任号召全国基督教徒普遍深入三自革新运动，彻底割断与帝国主义的一切关系。
    【新华社十六日讯】中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会宗教事务处召集的处理接受美国津贴的基督教团体会议，于十六日在北京开幕。出席会议的代表，有基督教各全国性团体、区域性团体、地方性团体和个人代表共一百五十一人。大会推选了邵荃麟、何成湘、徐盈、周力行、吴耀宗、郑和甫、陈崇桂、赵紫宸、陈见真、涂羽卿、邓裕志、刘良模、萧国贵、王梓仲、贾玉铭、韦卓民等三十二人为主席团。首由政务院文化教育委员会副秘书长邵荃麟致开幕词。他说：这次会议是根据政务院一九五○年十二月二十九日发布的关于《处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定》，以及郭沫若副总理报告中提出的“接受美国津贴之中国宗教团体，应使之改变为中国教徒完全自办的团体，政府对于他们的自立、自养、自传运动，应予以鼓励”之原则而召集的。会议的任务是彻底切断中国基督教与美帝国主义的一切关系，并协助爱国教徒推进三自革新运动，以实现政务院的决定。他指出全国基督教徒应该在爱国主义思想的基础上，划清敌我的界线，配合抗美援朝群众爱国运动，来获得这一问题的彻底解决。
    文化教育委员会副主任陆定一向大会作了报告。他首先指出爱国的基督教徒与以共产党为领导的人民政府的团结，有着巩固的政治的基础，这便是中国人民政治协商会议所通过的共同纲领。他说：既然广大的基督教徒都爱祖国，既然有了一个可爱的人民的祖国，既然有着共同纲领这个共同的政治基础，基督教徒就完全可能和人民政府团结一致，在政府指导之下，肃清帝国主义的一切侵略影响。陆副主任接着从历史上揭发了美帝国主义一贯利用基督教进行侵略的罪恶活动。他进一步指出：自第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义在基督教的国际传教活动上也取得了独占的地位，组织了“世界基督教协进会”，把基督教作为它进行世界侵略的工具。美帝国主义对于利用宗教在中国进行文化侵略的阴谋，直到最近依然在继续实施。上海中华基督教总会去年七月的会刊上发表了“北美差会联合会中国委员会给中国某些基督教徒的复信”。这封信暴露了该会企图以金钱的利诱手段来收买中国某些基督教会，破坏中国三自革新运动的阴谋。爱国的中国基督教人士应该提高对美帝国主义的这种阴谋诡计的警惕性。陆副主任最后号召全国基督教徒积极拥护和参加抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命三大运动，并普遍深入地开展三自革新运动，彻底斩断和帝国主义的一切联系。
    中央人民政府内务部部长谢觉哉应邀向大会讲话。他希望这次会议要彻底清算帝国主义利用宗教侵略中国的罪恶，并勉励全体基督教人士克服困难，积极展开自立革新运动，踏上光明的前途。
    出席代表发言的有吴耀宗、陈崇桂、陈见真、韦卓民、涂羽卿、郑建业、王梓仲等七人。吴耀宗在讲话中提出三点意见：（一）扩大“中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径”宣言的签名运动，（二）用大力号召全国基督教徒参加抗美援朝运动，（三）控诉帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略的罪恶，并应努力进行政治学习，以提高自己的政治认识。其他六位代表的发言都充满了对于人民政府的感激。他们一致表示坚决地斩断与帝国主义的一切关系，要求控诉帝国主义利用基督教进行破坏活动的罪行，为实现中国基督教的三自革新而奋斗。
    大会听取了吴耀宗所作关于八个月来基督教革新运动的总结报告和邵荃麟副秘书长“对于接受美国津贴的基督教团体处理办法草案”的报告，该项处理办法经这次会议讨论通过后，将由文化教育委员会呈请政务院批准实施。
