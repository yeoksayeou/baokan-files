The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (hereinafter referred to as the Provincial Committee) held a provincial trade union work conference from February 28th to March 9th, deciding to elevate trade union work one step further on the existing foundation.

There are currently 464,260 employees in Zhejiang Province, with 280,300 trade union members (excluding materials from three counties in the Wenzhou area), accounting for more than 60% of the province's employees. In cities with a population of over 30,000, the majority of workers have been organized. The province's trade union organizations include seven area trade union offices, four city trade unions, eleven county trade unions, forty-four county trade union preparatory committees, and seventeen counties with individual trade union cadres. There are still eight counties where trade union work has not been initiated. There are a total of 35,829 grassroots trade unions in the province (excluding materials from ten counties in the Jinhua area and eleven counties in the Lin'an area), with 1,036 grassroots trade unions having undergone preliminary consolidation.

In the process of registering members, agents of capitalists and individual counter-revolutionaries were purged. However, the consolidation process was not integrated with production, and one-sided emphasis was placed on ideological qualities, leading to the purging of workers with relatively backward thinking. This greatly limited the mass nature of trade union organizations. Judging from the situation in six cities—Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, and Huzhou—grassroots trade unions can be divided into three types: The first type has organized the majority of workers, the trade union has prestige, the cadres are experienced, the democratic style is good, and production competitions have been initially carried out, with resolutions and plans being implemented. These trade unions account for about 20%; the second type has trade unions organized, but the masses have not been fully mobilized, some cadres are still active, but cadres are doing everything themselves, resolutions and plans cannot be fully implemented, and doing a good job in production is still just a slogan, not becoming the action of the masses. These grassroots trade unions account for about 50%; the third type has impure leadership and organizational composition, with foremen and employers among the leaders. This type mostly exists in decentralized industries, accounting for about 30%.

In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, 102 grassroots units in Zhejiang Province have launched patriotic production competitions, involving approximately 38,500 employees. Production competitions not only improve management, improve labor-capital relations, increase labor productivity, and reduce costs, but also improve the relationship between trade unions and the masses. In particular, the experience of Jinhua's production competition proves that production competitions can also be carried out in small cities and decentralized industries. They also created the experience of moving from points to areas: starting from a cloth factory's production competition, the production competition in the entire county was promoted through methods such as labor model conferences and challenges. At present, competitions in small cities mostly remain at increasing labor intensity, without grasping the main key of improving technology, improving working methods, and management. The content of the competition is relatively general, and the development is still uneven. The idea of trade unions facing production has not yet been implemented. Capitalists generally take a bystander attitude towards production improvement and competition, or only want workers to compete without being willing to solve the problems of bonuses, labor protection, and welfare.

Labor-capital relations throughout the province have gradually improved. For example, after the Ningbo Trade Union overcame its right-leaning tendencies, the relationship between the Hefeng Yarn Factory Trade Union and the masses and labor-capital relations have undergone fundamental improvements, and there has also been great progress in production. The original 20-count yarn production of 0.875 pounds per 22-hour spindle has now been increased to 0.95 pounds. However, many small cities have not yet established labor administrative departments, and labor-capital dispute issues are all handled by trade unions. This makes trade union work trapped in labor-capital disputes. Some capitalists do not implement the principle of labor-capital consultation, and trade unions also lack supervision. As for the phenomenon of beating and scolding apprentices, it is still quite common in small towns.

At the trade union work conference held from February 28th to March 9th this year, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee inspected the province's trade union work. It pointed out that from August of last year to March of this year, due to the Provincial Committee focusing its main efforts on leading land reform, it relaxed its attention to trade union work, which led to many problems. The trade union organizational structure is unsound. Some local party committees transferred trade union cadres at will without the consent of higher-level trade unions. For example, the director of the Lishui Area Trade Union Office has been transferred, and the Zhejiang Provincial Trade Union is still unaware of this; in addition, the trade union offices in Wenzhou, Lin'an, and Linhai areas lack main full-time cadres, and very few of the chairmen of county trade unions are full-time. Some trade union cadres are not at ease with their work, which also affects the development of trade union work.

The most important thing is that the idea of relying on the working class is blurred. This is reflected in all aspects: local people's governments do not pay enough attention to trade union work, and some cultural and educational departments do not allocate cultural and educational funds to trade unions; many trade unions do not have office buildings and necessary equipment, and the trade unions of Xiaofeng, Lin'an, and Yuhang counties were forcibly evicted from their offices; individual government personnel have a very incorrect understanding of trade unions and are dissatisfied with salaried worker cadres, believing that "workers only know how to ask for welfare, and a worker's salary is higher than that of five county heads, so what are they talking about serving the people?!" A district chief in Xinchang County wanted worker and peasant organizations to be together, believing that workers and peasants should not be separated. Due to cadres' vague understanding of trade unions, the relationship between trade unions and peasant associations in some places is also abnormal. For example, the Dongpu Town Trade Union in Shaoxing needs to obtain approval from the peasant association to hold meetings. There are also many confused ideas among trade union cadres, believing that "workers in Shanghai and Hangzhou are progressive, while local workers are backward," and they do not believe in the workers' awareness, so they do everything themselves in their work, using coercion and command. In state-owned enterprises, the idea of relying on the working class is even more blurred. Some factories do not even allow workers to organize trade unions. For example, the manager of the Yuyao Department Store said to trade union cadres: "It is okay for you to organize a trade union, but everything must obey the leadership of the administration, and the trade union must be responsible for any problems." Furthermore, five professional companies in Jiaxing, and some state-owned and public-owned enterprise professional companies in Zhuji, Jinhua, Lishui, and other places do not pay trade union funds; some administrative departments of state-owned and public-owned enterprises in Wenzhou believe that "implementing the Trade Union Law is just about asking for money"; the Liqun Cigarette Factory of the Zhejiang Military Region not only does not pay trade union funds, but instead asks the trade union to hand over the membership fees paid by its members to the administration; for example, the Lishui Department Store refuses unemployed workers to participate in work on the pretext of not using salaried personnel.

Based on this situation, the Provincial Committee decided to gradually strengthen its leadership over trade unions, improve the trade union organization, the entire party earnestly study the Trade Union Law and the Labor Insurance Regulations, and establish the idea of relying on the working class. It also determined that the main content of trade union work in 1951 is to strengthen current affairs education, further carry out the mass movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and oppose the rearmament of Japan, gradually and guidedly carry out patriotic production competitions, and promote the competition methods of the Ma Hengchang Group. In small towns, the majority of employed workers should be organized, unemployed workers should continue to be assisted, labor insurance work should be strengthened, and the urgent demands of the working masses should be seriously resolved. Efforts should be made to elevate trade union work throughout the province one step further in 1951.

### 浙江省委加强对工会工作的检查和领导

　　浙江省委加强对工会工作的检查和领导
    中国共产党浙江省委员会（以下简称省委）于二月二十八日到三月九日，召开了全省工会工作会议，决定在现有的基础上，把工会工作提高一步。
    浙江全省现有职工四十六万四千二百六十余人，工会会员二十八万零三百余人（缺温州专区三个县材料），占全省职工的百分之六十以上。三万人口以上的城市，大多数的工人已组织起来。全省工会组织有七个专区工会办事处、四个市工会、十一个县工会、四十四个县工会筹备会，十七个县有个别的工会干部，没有开辟工会工作的还有八个县。全省基层工会共有三万五千八百二十九个（缺金华区十个县及临安区十一个县的材料），经初步整理的有一千零三十六个基层工会。
    在登记会员工作中，清洗了资方代理人及个别反革命分子。但在整理过程中未与生产结合，片面强调思想品质，因此把思想比较落后的工人也清洗了。这就使工会组织的群众性，受到很大限制。就杭州、宁波、温州、绍兴、嘉兴、湖州六个城市情况看，基层工会可分三种类型：第一种已组织了大多数的工人，工会有威信，干部经过锻炼，民主作风较好，初步进行生产竞赛，决议计划能贯彻。这种工会约占百分之二十；第二种是工会已组织，但群众未充分发动，部分干部尚积极，但干部包办代替，决议计划不能全部贯彻，搞好生产还只是口号，未成为群众的行动。这样的基层工会约占百分之五十左右；第三种类型是领导和组织成份不纯，在领导人员中，有包工头雇主，这一类大部存在于分散行业中，约占百分之三十。
    在抗美援朝运动中，浙江全省已进行爱国主义生产竞赛的基层单位有一百零二个，职工约三万八千五百余人。生产竞赛不仅能改善管理，改进劳资关系，提高劳动生产率，降低成本，而且还能改进工会与群众的关系。特别是金华生产竞赛的经验证明了：在小城市和分散的行业中，也可以搞生产竞赛。他们并创造了从点到面的经验：从一个布厂生产竞赛起经过劳动模范大会挑战等方式，推动了全县的生产竞赛。目前小城市的竞赛大多停留在提高劳动强度上，没有抓住提高技术改进工作方法和管理的主要关键。竞赛内容比较一般化，开展也还不平衡。工会面向生产的思想尚未贯彻下去。资方一般对生产的改进与竞赛抱旁观态度，或者只要工人竞赛不肯解决奖金与劳动保护福利问题。
    全省劳资关系已逐步走向好转。如宁波工会克服了右倾偏向后，和丰纱厂工会与群众关系、劳资关系有了根本改善，而且在生产上也大有进步。该厂原二十支纱二十二小时锭扯为零点八七五磅，现已提高到零点九五磅。但有许多小城市尚未设立劳动行政部门，劳资争议问题，都由工会处理。这就使工会工作陷于劳资纠纷之中，有些资方不执行劳资协商的原则，工会亦缺乏监督。至于打骂学徒现象，在小城镇中还相当普遍。
    浙江省委在今年二月二十八日到三月九日的工会工作会议上，对该省工会工作进行了检查。指出，从去年八月到今年三月，由于省委把主要力量放在领导土地改革上，对工会工作有些放松，致发生了不少问题。工会组织机构不健全，有些地区的党委不经过上级工会的同意，随便调动工会干部，如丽水专区工会办事处主任已调走，浙江省工会还不知道；另外温州、临安、临海等三个专区工会办事处均无主要专职干部，各县工会主席专职的也很少。某些工会干部不安心工作，也影响了工会工作的开展。
    最重要的是依靠工人阶级的思想模糊。这表现在各个方面：各地人民政府对工会工作不够重视，有些文教部门不拨交工会文教费；许多工会没有办公房子和应有的设备，孝丰、临安、余杭三县工会曾被强制搬出办公室；个别政府人员对工会认识很不正确，对薪金制工人干部不满意，认为“工人就知道要福利，一个工人工资比五个县长还要高，还谈什么为人民服务？！”新昌县一个区长要工农组织在一起，认为工农不要分家。由于干部对工会认识模糊，致使有些地方工会与农会的关系也不正常。如绍兴东浦镇工会开会要经农会批准。工会干部中也有不少糊涂观念，认为“沪杭工人进步，本地工人落后”，不相信工人的觉悟，因而在工作中包办代替，强迫命令。在国营企业中，依靠工人阶级的思想更模糊。有些工厂甚至不允许工人组织工会。如余姚百货公司经理对工会干部说：“你们组织工会是可以的，但一切要服从行政领导，出了问题，要工会负责。”又如嘉兴五个专业公司，诸暨、金华、丽水等地若干国营公营企业专业公司等，均不缴给工会经费；温州有些国营公营企业行政方面认为“实行工会法就是要钱”；浙江军区利群烟厂非但不缴工会经费，反过来要工会将会员所缴会费缴给行政；如丽水百货公司以不用薪金制人员为借口，拒绝失业工人参加工作。
    根据此种情况省委决定逐步加强对工会的领导，健全工会机构，全党认真学习工会法，劳动保险条例，树立依靠工人阶级的思想。并确定一九五一年工会工作的主要内容是加强时事教育，进一步开展抗美援朝反对重新武装日本的群众运动，有领导地逐渐地开展爱国主义生产竞赛，推广马恒昌小组的竞赛方法。在小城镇要把在业工人的大多数组织起来，继续救济失业工人，加强劳动保险工作，认真解决工人群众的迫切要求。争取在一九五一年把全省工会工作提高一步。
