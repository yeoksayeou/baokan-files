Correctly Implement the Marriage Law and Eliminate the Feudal Marriage System
Xu Deheng, Acting Chairman of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government

    It has been a year since the promulgation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China! The promulgation of this important law has brought boundless light and happiness to the broad masses of men and women, especially young men and women. Moreover, thanks to the correct implementation and in-depth publicity of the marriage policy by cadres in various regions, significant achievements have been made and tremendous effects have been achieved in the past year. These achievements and effects are the foundation for continuing to destroy the feudal marriage system and accelerate the forward development of the new democratic marriage system.

  (I)

    The facts of the past year prove that wherever cadres have attached sufficient importance to the Marriage Law, carried out correct publicity, and earnestly implemented it, the superiority of the new marriage system has been fully demonstrated, and it has had a profound impact on people's lives. Now, let us briefly explain this from the following aspects:

    First, the establishment of new marital relationships: In areas where the Marriage Law has been correctly publicized and earnestly implemented, the vast number of young men and women have used the "Marriage Law" as a powerful weapon to carry out a tenacious struggle to win free and independent happy marriages, and have achieved great victories. For example, on a national scale, according to statistics from Beijing alone from May to October 1950, there were 6,686 free marriages (and 1,279 reasonable divorces). In the Jiaodong area, within three months at the end of 1950, a total of 3,000 young men and women went to the People's Government to register their marriages. In Xiaoxinzhuang, Ding County, Hebei Province, with the active assistance of the local government and the Communist Youth League, within a few months after the promulgation of the Marriage Law, there were 15 couples who freely and independently engaged and married. Some of them, despite being beaten, scolded, and intimidated, still refused to yield and warned their parents, "The new Marriage Law opposes forced and arranged marriages. If you interfere with freedom of marriage, you will be punished by national law!" and finally achieved victory. This new type of marriage based on the combination of love between men and women will undoubtedly establish normal and happy family relationships. This is also an important condition for family members to exert a high degree of labor enthusiasm, and it becomes a healthy cell of the new society.

    Second, the struggle of the broad masses of women against the old marriage system: In areas where the Marriage Law has been correctly publicized and earnestly implemented, women who have been oppressed and ravaged by the old marriage system for many years have also awakened and demanded to break away from the fate of "family slaves." This is reflected in the fact that after the promulgation of the Marriage Law, marriage cases, especially divorce cases, in various regions have risen sharply, and the vast majority of divorces have been filed by women. Because the People's Courts have adopted a cautious but firm attitude and correctly and reasonably resolved many marriage cases, they have won the sympathy and support of the people. In particular, these liberated women reflect: "The court is ten times better than my parents' home!" "Now there is a way out, the Communist Party saved me!" Some want to publish announcements in newspapers to thank Chairman Mao. For example, Wu Lan, a widow in a village in Yunxiao County, Fujian Province, wanted to marry, but was opposed by the elderly in the same village. To this end, the People's Government convened a mass meeting to publicize the Marriage Law, criticize backward ideas, and publicly announce its approval for her to marry, which won the trust of the masses. Women in Hunan Province who had their divorce problems reasonably resolved by the People's Courts all gratefully said: "If it weren't for Chairman Mao, we would never be able to turn ourselves over in this life." The People's Courts in Chongqing and western Sichuan helped 6,558 women break free from the shackles of unreasonable marriages, and they reflected: "The Marriage Law has liberated me. Only by working hard in production can I be worthy of Chairman Mao." A woman in Tangshan City suffered from mental illness due to abuse by her husband and mother-in-law. After the divorce, her mental state returned to normal, and she actively participated in production and study and is now a member of the neighborhood committee. All of this shows that in areas where the People's Government has correctly implemented and deeply publicized the marriage policy, the broad masses of women have waged a heroic and tenacious struggle against the old feudal marriage system and have achieved great victories. (⑴⑶)

    Third, the growth of new morality and new views on marriage: Due to the correct implementation and in-depth publicity of the Marriage Law, the people's political consciousness has also been raised, the new social views of equality between men and women, morality, and correct views on love have been publicized, and after the healthy development of marital relationships, young men and women no longer regard the other party's "amount of property and family status" as conditions, but choose their partners based on "ability to work, love of learning, and progressive thinking." Many young women have criticized the old idea of "marry a man, marry a man, have clothes to wear and food to eat," and are actively working hard to achieve economic independence in order to realize their beautiful, free, and voluntary new marriages. For example, a woman in a county in western Liaoning Province, Northeast China, fell in love with a model self-defense team member, but her father disagreed because he disliked the other party's poverty. She used the reason of loving the other party's "progressive thinking and good work" to finally persuade her father. A female worker in a net fishing boat factory in Dalian ran away when the sedan chair of a merchant who came to marry her arrived at the door because she fell in love with another hardworking and progressive worker. Some women in Lin County, Pingyuan Province, proposed that the other party agree to her "participating in civil schools, winter schools, various meetings, and mutual aid groups" as conditions for marriage. These are all clear evidence that new social morality and new views on marriage have already been manifested in action.

    Fourth, changes in old marriage and family relationships: As the old marriage system is shattered, the degree of awakening of women has further increased. In some areas (that is, areas where the Marriage Law is correctly and earnestly implemented), due to the beginning of the growth of new moral concepts in people's lives, the old husband-wife relationship has also begun to change. For example, in Chongqing's 21st and 31st factories, after studying the Marriage Law, many husbands no longer interfere with their wives' social activities, and mutual assistance has become quite common. Some women have participated in production work, and as a result, many quarrelsome families have been transformed into harmonious and united families. Obviously, in these areas, the implementation of the Marriage Law has also achieved good results in the transformation of old marriage and family relationships.

    Fifth, the emergence of more new-style families: Due to the reasonable resolution of marriage problems, young partners place their hopes and happiness on the infinitely beautiful future, laying a good foundation for building new democratic families. Under the goal of "mutual love and respect, mutual help, mutual support, harmony and unity, labor and production, raising children, and striving together for family happiness and new social construction," new-style families are constantly emerging throughout the country. Young couples in rural areas actively work hard and do a good job in production. In factories, young couples compete with each other to create new records. For example, a young Communist Youth League member couple in a village in Feixian County, Shandong Province, proposed the slogan "Guarantee to do a good job in the labor exchange team and drive others with their own active actions" when they got engaged. The masses reflected: "It's still better to have freedom of marriage than arranged marriages by parents." Li Erfeng in a village in Qi County, Pingyuan Province, organized her whole family to work in the fields after freely marrying, and also seized the time to study in her spare time. Her home is filled with a pleasant and harmonious new atmosphere. A young couple in a factory in Dalian City check their work, study, and life every week after get off work every Saturday in order to improve each other and make progress together. Another young couple in a shipyard proposed "Completing the task ahead of schedule, humbly studying technology, increasing production, saving materials, and striving to overcome shortcomings" as a guarantee for engagement, which resulted in great work achievements, and the young male worker also joined the Communist Party. There are many examples of such new-style marital families in many regions across the country.

    In short, the broad masses of people are using this effective legal weapon—the Marriage Law—to eradicate the dark and corrupt feudal marriage system, establish a bright and new democratic marriage system, thereby establishing a new social life, new marital and family relationships, and new moral concepts, and inspiring the production enthusiasm and political enthusiasm of the broad masses of men and women, especially the broad masses of women. This is very beneficial to promoting the construction of New China.

  (II)

    However, the implementation of the Marriage Law is not satisfactory in all regions. In some places, because cadres lack a correct understanding of the Marriage Law, they have not implemented this law well when dealing with people's marriage problems, and some major deviations have even occurred, which need to be corrected and overcome urgently:

    First, some cadres have a strong feudal patriarchal ideology and hold a skeptical and resistant attitude towards the Marriage Law: This is reflected in the fact that they dare not publicize the implementation of the Marriage Law, but want to "keep it secret." They delay dealing with marriage cases under the pretext of mediation, and some even take open suppression and interference: Women who demand divorce are detained and subjected to "forced mediation." Some are "going to have an education and transformation." Some were locked in granaries and so-called "suppressed." Bachelors and widows who freely marry are also tied up and considered "illegal." The government of Mianyang County, Hubei Province, even expelled a woman from the People's Representatives Conference because she requested a divorce. The propaganda cadre of the Caodian District Committee of Jun County even instigated his uncle to beat his divorced aunt and forced his aunt to kowtow and apologize to restore the marital relationship. These cadres cannot stand freedom of marriage, especially freedom of divorce. They think it is "bad influence!" "The most dishonorable thing!" "Immoral!" What is the "morality" that these cadres refer to? Obviously, it is not the new morality of the new democratic marriage system, but the old morality of the feudal marriage system that women should be absolutely controlled by their husbands, that women must maintain absolute chastity and obedience, that "marry a chicken, follow a chicken, marry a dog, follow a dog," and "remain faithful to one person until death." They use this corrupt old moral concept of oppressing women to oppose the principle of "freedom of marriage for men and women" in the new society. Therefore, they regard some women's legitimate and reasonable divorce requests as "unruly," "jumping out of the circle," "jumping ship," and "too naughty." They worry that "if there is freedom of marriage, the world will be in chaos!" They hold this feudal "husband's power" prejudice, intentionally or unintentionally obstruct and undermine the Marriage Law, and infringe on women's personal freedom, which often causes many serious consequences. This needs to be educated and severely corrected, and even given necessary sanctions.

    This feudal "husband's power" ideology is also reflected in the fact that women are regarded as men's private property, and women's legitimate interests are not recognized. Therefore, they believe that divorce is "losing both money and people" and sympathize with some backward masses' reflections: "The poor have turned over, and their wives are divorced." Therefore, the handling of divorce cases is either unconditionally suppressed, or even if the divorce is granted, the woman is not allowed to take property with her, or even ordered to hand over certain property under the names of "remarriage fee," "bride price," and "compensation for losses." It is said that this is to prevent the man from "losing both money and people," or that it is to "take care of the interests of poor peasants and hired laborers." However, the oppressed and ravaged poor peasant and hired laborer women are ignored. This is obviously contrary to the principle of "protecting the legitimate interests of women and children."

    Second, some cadres take a indifferent attitude towards the implementation of the Marriage Law, and do not sympathize with or support women who have been persecuted by the feudal marriage system, so that many women who rise up to fight fail due to isolation and helplessness. For example, a child bride in Jianyang, northern Jiangsu, was beaten and went to the township instructor, but the instructor said: "They are tough, what can I do?" The township chief of Shencheng Township ignored the appeals of two women, resulting in one being abused even more severely by her husband and the other being forced to run away. In Xiangtan, Hunan, there were 180 cases of abuse of women in June last year, but only 40 were reported to the court. In Linquan and Fuyang counties in northern Anhui, as many as 64 people were beaten to death or forced to commit suicide in a few months last year. Local cadres in these abused and persecuted incidents mostly failed to stop them in time, or even ignored them. Even if they were reported, they were not dealt with in a timely manner, or not given the deserved sanctions. Some judicial sections even adopted the method of "muddying the waters," telling those who forced people to death to bury them thickly. This kind of handling not only fails to achieve the effect of preventing feudal abuse, but also encourages the growth of illegal events. Cadres in these areas either have a feudal consciousness of valuing men over women, or regard these incidents as small family matters, and do not understand that the implementation of the Marriage Law is a revolution against the old marriage system for thousands of years, and it is a major social reform work to liberate the broad masses of women from the old marriage system. The experience of the past year proves that the destruction of the old marriage system and its replacement with the new marriage system stipulated by the Marriage Law is a fierce struggle like other social reforms. If a cadre who serves the people sits idly by and watches the persecution and abuse of the broad masses of women in the face of this great anti-feudal struggle, and neglects the ordinances promulgated by the government long ago, then such a cadre is unprincipled and cannot be forgiven in terms of law and discipline.

    Third, a very unserious and frivolous attitude is adopted towards the implementation of the Marriage Law: The most important here is the specific application of Article 17, Paragraph 2 of the Marriage Law, either misunderstanding the "immediate judgment" in the article as "immediate divorce," or taking an irresponsible and perfunctory attitude in style. Thus, either one-sidedly emphasizing "freedom of divorce" in publicity, or accommodating the party requesting divorce without principle in the trial of cases, forming a "responding to every request" hasty divorce phenomenon: For example, the Yongzhou Prefectural Office, based on the one-sided request of the southbound cadres, judged the divorce of 21 couples without notifying the other party of the statutory procedure for defense, which is said to be in order to "take care of" the cadres' emotions. The husband and wife of Xiao Shixiu in Nankang have always been very good, but because of a temporary quarrel, they filed for divorce, and the court actually allowed it. Guo Choumei in Shexian County has divorced and married as many as three times in a year. The result of this kind of "hasty divorce" will inevitably produce more abnormal phenomena: for example, the thing that divorcing one day and requesting to resume marriage the next day has happened. Some only propose reasons for divorce such as the other party's "ugly face," "rough skin," "too short," and "illiteracy." There are also women who request a divorce only because "the husband is poor and life is not good" and "the husband is unemployed." This is precisely in violation of the spirit of the Marriage Law regarding "husband and wife having the obligations of mutual respect and love, mutual help, mutual support, harmony and unity, labor and production, raising children, and striving together for family happiness and new social construction." This will leave a very bad impression on the masses, leading to misunderstandings, reflecting that the court is a "divorce office" and the Marriage Law is a "divorce law," and expressing dissatisfaction. In some areas, special agents and bandits took the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, forming a chaotic phenomenon. This attitude of "hasty divorce" without asking whether the husband and wife can continue their marital relationship, without investigating and studying the thoughts, motives, and reasons for requesting a divorce, also did not consider what unfortunate fate these families that were easily destroyed due to selfish plans and temporary impulses, as well as the abandoned wives and husbands, and the underage children who became semi-orphans, would suffer. The people's judicial workers should proceed from the interests of the masses and society, and be good at waging serious struggles against those who use "freedom of marriage" as an excuse for cupism in relationships between men and women, as well as those who disregard the interests of children. For those disputes between old couples who may reconcile, we should not simply dismantle them, but should carry out persistent education and transformation work and take a cautious and responsible attitude.

  (III)

    The promulgation of the Marriage Law has greatly promoted the fierce struggle between the new and old marriage systems. The facts of the past year prove that the universal and in-depth implementation of the Marriage Law is only the beginning, and its complete realization will require a long period of struggle. This is mainly due to the influence of traditional feudal consciousness and habits for thousands of years, reflected in people's family relationships, relationships between men and women, etc., which cannot be clarified for a while. Our cadres, especially district and village cadres, are also from the old society, and many unconsciously render the influence of feudal consciousness and habits of the old society. Especially on this issue, there is no higher political consciousness, which is also natural. To this end, we should continue to extensively and deeply study and publicize the Marriage Law, actively carry out criticism and self-criticism to overcome the remnants of the old era in the thinking of cadres, and improve the correct understanding of the Marriage Law. This is a long-term and arduous task in the future, and it is a link of decisive significance to continue to implement the Marriage Law.

　　正确执行婚姻法  消灭封建的婚姻制度
    中央人民政府法制委员会代主任委员　许德珩
    中华人民共和国婚姻法的公布已经一年了！这一重大法令的公布，给予广大男女群众特别是青年男女群众带来了无限的光明与幸福，更由于各地工作干部对婚姻政策的正确执行与深入宣传，一年来已经获得了显著的成绩，收到了巨大的效果，这种成绩和效果，就是今后继续摧毁封建婚姻制度，和加速促进新民主主义婚姻制度的向前发展的基础。
  （一）
    一年来的事实证明：凡是干部对婚姻法引起了足够的重视，进行了正确的宣传，与认真贯彻实行的地区，就充分显示出新婚姻制度的优越性，在人民生活中就发生深刻的影响。现在从以下几个方面分别加以简要地说明：
    第一、新的婚姻关系之建立：在正确宣传与认真贯彻婚姻法的地区，广大青年男女，一年来运用了“婚姻法”这一有力武器，为争取自由自主的美满婚姻，进行了顽强地斗争，并得到了很大的胜利。例如：在全国范围内，仅就北京市一九五○年五月至十月份的统计，自由结婚的有六六八六对（合理离婚的有一二七九对），胶东区一九五○年年底三个月内共有三千对青年男女到人民政府举行婚姻登记。河北省定县小辛庄，在当地政府和青年团的积极协助之下，在婚姻法公布后的几个月内，由男女双方自由自主订婚、结婚的就有十五对，其中有的虽遭受打、骂、威吓，仍不屈服，并警告他们的家长说：“新婚姻法反对强迫包办，你们干涉婚姻自由，要受国法制裁！”终于得到胜利。这种以男女爱情相结合为基础的新式婚姻，无疑地将建立起正常的幸福的家庭关系，这也正是男女家庭成员发挥高度劳动热情的重要条件，而成为新社会的健全细胞。
    第二、广大妇女群众对旧婚姻制度的斗争：在正确宣传与认真贯彻婚姻法的地区，多年来曾被旧婚姻制度压迫蹂躏下的妇女，也觉悟起来，要求摆脱“家庭奴隶”的命运。这表现在婚姻法公布后，各地婚姻案件特别是离婚案件的突趋上升，而绝大多数的离婚又是由女方提出这一事实上。由于人民法院采取了谨慎而又坚决的态度，正确合理的解决了许多婚姻案件，就博得了人民的同情和拥护，特别是这些获得解放了的妇女，反映着：“法院比我娘家好十分！”“现在有活路了，共产党救了我！”有的要登报感谢毛主席。例如：福建省云霄县某村寡妇吴兰要求结婚，受到同村老年人的反对，人民政府为此特召开了群众大会宣传婚姻法，批判落后思想，并公开宣布准其结婚，获得了群众的信任；湖南省经人民法院合理解决离婚问题的妇女都感激说：“要不是毛主席，我们一世也翻不了身”；重庆、川西两地人民法院帮助六五五八个妇女解除了不合理婚姻的束缚，她们反映说：“婚姻法把我解放了，只有努力生产才对得住毛主席”；唐山市一个妇女，被丈夫婆婆虐待得患了神经病，离婚后精神就恢复正常了，积极地参加了生产和学习，现已成为居民委员会的委员。这都说明了在人民政府对婚姻政策的正确执行与深入宣传的地区，广大妇女向着旧的封建婚姻制度作了英勇顽强的斗争，并取得了伟大的胜利。（⑴⑶）
    第三、新道德与新婚姻观点的生长：由于婚姻法的正确执行与深入宣传，也提高了人民的政治觉悟，宣扬了新社会男女平等观、道德观和正确恋爱观，使得健康的婚姻关系蓬勃发展之后，青年男女不再以对方的“财产多寡和门第高低”为条件，而是以“能劳动、爱学习和思想进步”为标准去选择自己的伴侣；不少青年妇女批判了“嫁汉嫁汉，穿衣吃饭”的旧思想，都在积极劳动，争取经济独立，去实现其美满的自由自愿的新婚姻。例如：东北辽西省某县一妇女爱上了模范自卫队员，父亲因嫌对方贫穷而不同意，她以爱对方的“思想进步、劳动好”作理由，终于说服了父亲；大连某网渔船厂一女工，当着来娶她的商人的轿子抬到门口时，她逃跑了，因为她爱上了另外一个勤劳的进步的工人；平原省林县有些妇女提出了要对方同意她“参加民校、参加冬学、参加各种会议、参加互助组”等作为结婚条件。这都是新的社会道德和新的婚姻观点已经在行动上表现出来的明证。
    第四、旧婚姻家庭关系的改变：随着旧婚姻制度的被打碎，妇女的觉悟程度，更加提高了。在有些地区（即正确认真地贯彻婚姻法的地区），由于新的道德观念在人民生活中开始生长，也使旧的夫妻关系开始发生了变化。例如：重庆二十一厂、三十一厂在学习了婚姻法后，许多丈夫不干涉妻子的社会活动，相当普遍地作到了相互帮助；有的妇女参加了生产工作，这样一来，就把许多吵嚷呕气的家庭，化为和睦团结的家庭了。显然，在这些地区，婚姻法的实行，对旧的婚姻家庭关系的改造，也是收到了良好效果的。
    第五、新式家庭更多的出现：由于婚姻问题的合理解决，青年伙伴们将希望与幸福寄托在无限美好的将来，为健全新民主主义的新家庭打下了良好的基础。在“互爱互敬、互相帮助、互相扶养、和睦团结、劳动生产、抚育子女，为家庭幸福和新社会建设而共同奋斗”的目标下，新式家庭不断在全国各地涌现着；农村中的青年夫妇，积极劳动，搞好生产；工厂里，青年夫妇互相竞赛，创造新纪录。例如：山东费县某村一对青年团员在订婚时提出了“保证搞好变工队，以自己的积极行动带动别人”的口号，群众反映说：“还是婚姻自由好，比父母包办强的多”；平原省淇县某村李二凤，在自由结婚后，便组织全家下地生产，在空闲时还抓紧学习，家中充满了愉快与和睦的新气象；大连市某工厂一对青年夫妇，于每星期六下班后便将他们一周来的工作、学习、生活各方面都作一次检查，以便双方互相提高，共同进步；另一造船厂一对青年工人提出了“提前完成任务，虚心钻研技术，提高生产量，节约材料，努力克服缺点”等项保证作为订婚条件，结果作出了很大的工作成绩，同时青年男工也参加了共产党。像这种新式婚姻家庭的例子，在全国许多地区都是很多的。
    总之，广大人民正在运用这一有效的法律武器——婚姻法去根除黑暗、腐朽的封建主义婚姻制度，建立光明新生的新民主主义婚姻制度，从而树立起新的社会生活、新的婚姻家庭关系和新的道德观念，鼓舞起广大男女群众特别是广大妇女群众的生产热情和政治热情。这对促进新中国的各项建设事业是十分有利的。
  （二）
    但是，婚姻法的贯彻实行，不是在一切地区都令人满意的，某些地方，因干部对婚姻法缺乏正确的理解，处理人民婚姻问题时，还没有很好的贯彻这一法令，甚至发生了某些较大的偏向，急需纠正和克服：
    一、有些干部存在着浓厚的封建宗法思想，对婚姻法抱着怀疑和抗拒的态度：这表现在对婚姻法的实行，不敢宣传，却要“保守秘密”。对婚姻案件，借口调解，拖延不理，有的更采取公开的压制和干涉：对要求离婚的妇女，有被扣押起来，加以“强迫调解”的。有的“要来一个教育改造”的。有的被关在谷仓里，加以所谓“镇压”的。光棍与寡妇自由结婚，也被捆起来，认为是“非法”的。湖北沔阳县政府竟因一个妇女要求离婚，开除了她各界人民代表会议的代表资格。均县草店区区委宣传干事竟主使其叔父毒打其离了婚的婶母，并威逼他婶母磕头道歉来恢复夫妻关系。这些干部看不惯婚姻自由，特别是离婚自由，他们认为是“影响不好”！“最不名誉的事”！是“不道德”！这些干部所指的“道德”又是什么呢？显然不是新民主主义婚姻制度的新道德，而是那种女子应绝对受丈夫的支配，女子必须保持绝对的贞洁和服从，是那种“嫁鸡跟鸡，嫁狗跟狗”、“从一而终”的封建婚姻制度的旧道德。他们用这种腐朽的压迫妇女的旧道德观念，去与新社会的“男女婚姻自由”的原则对立起来。因此他们对某些妇女的正当合理的离婚要求，看成是“不规矩”，是“跳圈”“跳槽”，是“太调皮了”。耽心着“婚姻自由了，要天下大乱！”他们持有这种封建“夫权”的偏见，有意无意的阻挠、破坏婚姻法，侵害妇女的人身自由，因此往往造成许多严重的后果。这是需要加以教育和严厉纠正，甚至给予必要制裁的。
    这种封建“夫权”思想，还表现在把妇女看成是男子的私有财产，不承认妇女的合法利益；因此认为离婚是“人财两空”，同情着某些落后群众关于：“穷人翻了身，老婆离了婚”的反映。于是对离婚案件的处理，或者是无条件的加以压制，或者即使判离了也不主张女方带产，甚至以“续娶费”，“身价费”，“赔偿损失费”等名目，判令女方交出若干财物。据说这是为了男方不至于“人财两空”，或者说这是为了“照顾贫雇农的利益”。但对受压迫受蹂躏的贫雇农妇女，却被忽视了。这显然是违背了“保护妇女及子女合法利益”之原则的。
    二、对婚姻法的贯彻执行，部分干部采取着漠不关心的态度，对妇女遭受封建婚姻制度的迫害，不加以同情，不给以支持，以至不少起来斗争的妇女，因孤立无援而失败。例如：苏北建阳一个童养媳遭受毒打，去找乡指导员，但这位指导员却说：“人家硬，我有什么办法呢？”沈澄乡的乡长，对两个妇女的申诉不睬理，结果一个遭受丈夫虐待更厉害，一个被迫逃跑；湖南湘潭在去年六月份共发生虐待妇女的事件一百八十起，告到法院的只四十起；皖北临泉、阜阳两县在去年几个月内被打死和被逼自杀的竟达六十四人，这些被虐杀被迫害的事件，地方干部多未及时制止，甚至置之不理，即使告发了，也处理不及时，或未予以应得的制裁。有的司法科，更采取“和稀泥”的办法，叫逼死人命者厚葬了事。这种处理，不但不能收到制止封建虐待的效果，而且助长了违法事件的增长。这些地区的干部，或者存在着重男轻女的封建意识，或者把这些事件看成是家庭小事，而不了解婚姻法的贯彻实行，是对几千年旧婚姻制度的革命，是为了把广大妇女从旧婚姻制度下解放出来的重大的社会改革工作。一年来的经验证明，旧婚姻制度的摧毁，代之以婚姻法规定的新的婚姻制度，和其他的社会改革一样是剧烈的斗争，一个为人民服务的干部，在这种伟大的反封建斗争面前，如果坐视广大妇女群众的被迫害、被虐杀，而漠不关心，放弃领导，并忽视政府早经颁布的法令，那这样干部便是毫无原则的，在法纪上也是不能宽恕的。
    三、对婚姻法的贯彻实行，采取着极不严肃的轻率态度：这里最主要的是对婚姻法第十七条第二项的具体运用上，或者是将条文中的“即行判决”，误解为“即行判离”，或者是作风上采取不负责的草率马虎态度，于是或者在宣传中片面地强调“离婚自由”，或者在审理案件中，无原则的迁就要求离婚的一方。形成“有求必应”的草率离婚现象：比如永州专署根据南下干部的片面请求，未经通知对方答辩的法定程序，即判决了二十一对夫妻离婚，据说这是为了“照顾”干部的情绪。南康萧石秀夫妻一向很好，但因一时口角，提出离婚，法院竟也准许了。涉县的郭丑女，一年内离婚、结婚竟达三次之多。像这种“轻率判离”的结果，必然将产生更多的不正常的现象：比如像先一天判决离婚，第二天就请求恢复结婚的事发生了。有的仅仅提出对方“脸不好看”，“皮肤粗糙”，“个子太小”，“不认识字”等，作为离婚的借口了。也有的妇女仅因“丈夫穷，生活不好”、“丈夫失业”来请求离婚了。这正是违反了婚姻法中关于“夫妻有互敬互爱、互相帮助、互相扶养、和睦团结、劳动生产、抚育子女，为家庭幸福和新社会建设而共同奋斗的义务”的精神。这在群众中将留下极坏的影响，以至群众发生误解，反映法院是“离婚所”，婚姻法是“离婚法”，表示不满。有的地区，特务匪徒更趁机造谣破坏，形成混乱现象。这种不问男女双方是否能够继续夫妻关系的事实，不调查研究要求离婚的思想、动机和理由，而“轻率判离”的态度，也没有考虑到这些因自私打算，和一时冲动而被轻易破坏了的家庭和被遗弃了的妻子和丈夫，以及未成年的而成了半孤儿状态的孩子们，将遭受怎样不幸的命运。人民的司法工作者，是应该从群众的和社会的利益出发，而善于去和那些借口“婚姻自由”在男女关系上的杯水主义的行为，以及那些漠视子女利益的行为，作严肃的斗争，对那些可能和好的旧夫妻关系间的纠纷，也不是简单的拆散了事，而应该进行坚忍的教育改造工作，采取慎重的负责态度。
  （三）
    婚姻法的公布是大大地促进了新旧两种婚姻制度的剧烈斗争。一年来的事实证明，婚姻法的普遍深入的贯彻实行，还仅仅是开始，它的彻底实现，还要经过长时期的斗争。这主要是由于几千年来传统的封建意识和习惯的影响，反映在人们对家庭关系、男女关系等方面，一时尚不可能澄清，我们干部特别是区、村干部也因都是旧社会出身的，很多不自觉的渲染着旧社会的封建意识和习惯的影响，特别在这一问题上，还没有更高的政治觉悟，那也是自然的。为此，今后应继续广泛深入地学习与宣传婚姻法，积极开展批评与自我批评，来克服干部思想上的旧时代残余，提高对婚姻法的正确理解，是今后长期艰苦的任务，是继续贯彻实行婚姻法具有决定意义的一个环节。
