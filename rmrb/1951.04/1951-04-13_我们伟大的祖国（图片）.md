    Our Great Motherland
    China's coastal provinces produce large quantities of sea salt. The products of the Changlu salt flats in the Bohai Bay are especially famous at home and abroad. Among them, the sea salt produced in the Hangu salt fields is of the best quality, with about 200,000 workers participating in the production, and the annual output reaches more than 250,000 tons, ranking first in the country. This is a scene of workers raking salt in the salt fields during the spring drying season.
