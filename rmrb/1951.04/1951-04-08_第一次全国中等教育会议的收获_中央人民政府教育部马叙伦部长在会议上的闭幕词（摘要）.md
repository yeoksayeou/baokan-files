　　The Achievements of the First National Conference on Secondary Education
　　Closing Speech by Ma Xulun, Minister of Education of the Central People's Government (Abstract)
　　This conference has made various resolutions and decisions regarding secondary education, solving a very important part of the educational construction of the new China, and has achieved great success.
　　First, this conference affirmed that secondary education is an important link in national education construction and clarified the current construction guidelines for various secondary schools. For secondary technical schools, a policy of rectification and active development should be adopted. This is because economic construction is the basic link of national construction, and one of the most important difficulties in current economic construction is the lack of talent. Not only are advanced technical talents needed, but also a large number of intermediate technical talents are urgently needed. At present, the number of secondary technical schools and students nationwide is less than one-tenth of the total number of secondary schools, accounting for the smallest proportion. This phenomenon, which is incompatible with the needs of national construction, must be resolutely and as quickly as possible changed. Therefore, on the one hand, existing secondary technical schools should be transformed to meet the needs of construction; on the other hand, various enterprise departments should actively establish new technical schools, hold short-term training courses, and, where possible, transform some ordinary middle schools into secondary technical schools. For normal schools, a policy of rectification, consolidation, and appropriate development should be adopted. At present, primary school teachers and worker-peasant teachers across the country are not only of low level, but there is an extreme shortage in the old liberated areas. After the completion of land reform nationwide, with the rise of the national economy, the demands of workers, peasants, and their children for learning culture will become more urgent, and primary and worker-peasant education will have greater development. The existing quantity and quality of normal schools cannot meet this requirement. We must recognize this prospect and prepare early. Ordinary middle schools should focus on rectification, consolidation, and improvement, lay a good foundation, and prepare for development. Although ordinary middle schools account for about 80% of the number of secondary schools, the development in various regions is extremely uneven, the guidelines are not clear, the systems are not unified, and the quality of teaching varies. Strict rectification and improvement must be carried out.
　　Second, the conference discussed several main issues concerning ordinary middle schools. The purpose and educational goals of ordinary middle schools must conform to the principle of all-round development, so that the younger generation can achieve all-round development in intellectual, moral, physical, and aesthetic education and become conscious and active members of the new democratic society. The basic work of the school is teaching, and all organizations, all personnel, and all activities of the school must revolve around this center, obey the requirements of teaching, and strive to complete the teaching plan satisfactorily. The phenomena that are quite common at present that are detrimental to teaching or even hinder teaching must be resolutely overcome. To run schools well and do a good job in teaching, the principal responsibility system and the teacher responsibility system must be correctly implemented.
　　Classroom teaching is the main form of teaching, and extracurricular and off-campus activities should also be supplemented. Student organizations' extracurricular activities and social service work are an important organizational part of school education and are essential exercises for young people, which should be actively guided and closely coordinated with classroom teaching. Middle schools must adhere to the policy of opening the door to workers and peasants and must give workers and peasants the opportunity to receive formal secondary education so that they can master the weapons of culture and science and give full play to their talents and strengths.
　　Based on the above basic spirit, the conference revised and adopted the Provisional Regulations for Middle Schools (Draft) and discussed the curriculum standards (Draft) for political, language, history, geography, mathematics, physics, and chemistry and other subjects in ordinary middle schools. The conference determined the principle of curriculum and textbook reform, which must maintain complete scientificity and implement the spirit of patriotism, must study China, refer to the Soviet Union, and use Soviet middle school textbooks as a blueprint to rewrite new textbooks that are completely suitable for China's needs.
　　Third, the conference also discussed the issues of public-private relations, leadership relations, and student health. In order to correct the mistakes of neglecting and discriminating against private secondary schools, the policy of active support, strengthening leadership, and gradual transformation should continue to be implemented based on the principle of considering both public and private interests, and people from all walks of life should be encouraged to actively participate in educational construction. To this end, the conference revised and adopted the Decision on Actively Supporting and Improving Private Secondary Schools (Draft). In accordance with the principle of unified leadership, division of labor and responsibility, and running schools well, the Decision on the Leadership Relationship between Provinces, Cities, and Counties and Public Secondary Schools (Draft) was revised and adopted. In order to correct the ideas of many educational administrators and many school faculty and staff who underestimate student health issues and the attitude of indifference to student health issues, the conference revised and adopted the Decision on Student Health Issues (Draft) in accordance with Chairman Mao's policy of "health first."
　　Finally, Minister Ma Xulun said that at this conference, the direction of secondary education has been clarified, and the tasks have been put forward. This task is glorious but also arduous. It is not possible to implement this policy and complete these tasks by following the set of methods of the decadent capitalist countries. We must summarize our own experiences in China and learn the spirit and essence of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. This is a new topic before us. Given the limitations of manpower and financial resources, there will be many difficulties. This requires everyone to give full play to their high degree of initiative and creativity, overcome difficulties, create conditions, and strive to achieve them step by step. We must seize the time without any slackness, carry out the work of adjusting, unifying, rectifying, and consolidating the education cause, lay a good foundation, prepare conditions for development, and strive to welcome the arrival of the upsurge of cultural construction!

　　第一次全国中等教育会议的收获
　  中央人民政府教育部马叙伦部长在会议上的闭幕词（摘要）
    这次会议作出了有关中等教育的各项决议和决定，解决了新中国教育建设方面极关重要的一部分问题，是有很大的成就的。
    第一，这次会议肯定了中等教育是国家教育建设的重要环节，明确了当前各种中等学校的建设方针。对于中等技术学校，应采取整顿和积极发展的方针。这是因为经济建设是国家建设的基本环节，目前经济建设最主要的困难之一是缺乏人才，不仅需要高级技术人才，更迫切地需要大量的中等技术人才。目前全国中等技术学校和学生人数，不及中等学校总数的十分之一，所占比重最小。这种与国家建设需要不相适应的现象，必须坚决地、尽可能快地加以改变。因此，一方面应改造现有的中等技术学校，力求符合于建设的需要；一方面要协同各企业部门积极创办新的技术学校，举办短期训练班，并在可能条件下转变若干普通中学为中等技术学校。对于师范学校，应采取整顿、巩固并适当发展的方针。目前全国小学教师和工农教师不仅程度低，在老解放区已感到极端缺乏。全国完成土地改革之后，随着国民经济的上升，工农劳动人民及其子女学习文化的要求将更加迫切，小学和工农教育将有更大的发展，现有师范学校的数量和质量是满足不了这个要求的。我们必须认清这个前景，早做准备。对于普通中学，则应以整顿、巩固和提高为主，打好基础，准备发展。普通中学虽然在数量上占了中等学校的百分之八十左右，但各地区发展极不平衡，方针不明确，制度不统一，教学质量参差不齐，必须进行严格地整顿和提高。
    第二，会议讨论了关于普通中学的几个主要的问题。普通中学的宗旨和教育目标，必须符合全面发展的原则，使青年一代在智育、德育、体育、美育各方面获得全面发展，成为新民主主义社会自觉的积极的成员。学校的基本工作是教学，学校的一切组织、一切人员、一切活动，都必须围绕着这个中心，服从教学的要求，为圆满地完成教学计划而努力。目前相当普遍存在着的不利于教学、甚至妨害教学的现象，必须坚决加以克服。要办好学校，做好教学工作，必须正确地执行校长责任制和教师责任制。
    课堂教学是教学的主要形式，同时还要辅以课外和校外的活动。学生社团的课外活动和社会服务工作，是学校教育重要的组织部分，是青年必须有的锻炼，应积极加以辅导，并使与课堂教学密切地配合进行。中学必须坚持贯彻为工农开门的方针，必须给工农劳动人民以受正规中学教育的机会，使他们掌握起文化科学的武器，充分发挥他们的才能和力量。
    根据上述各项基本精神，会议修正通过了中学暂行规程（草案），讨论了普通中学的政治、语文、历史、地理以及数理化等学科的课程标准（草案）。会议确定课程教材改革的原则，必须保持完整的科学性和贯彻爱国主义的精神，必须研究中国、参考苏联，以苏联的中学教科书为蓝本，重编完全适合于中国需要的新教科书。
    第三，会议还讨论了公私关系问题、领导关系问题和学生健康问题。为了纠正忽视和歧视私立中等学校的错误，应依据公私兼顾的原则，继续贯彻积极扶持、加强领导、逐步改造的方针，鼓励各阶层人民积极参加教育建设事业。为此，会议修正通过了关于积极扶持与改进私立中等学校的决定（草案）。并本着统一领导、分工负责、办好学校的原则，修正通过了关于省、市、县对公立中等学校领导关系的决定（草案）。为了纠正许多教育行政人员和许多学校的教职员轻视学生健康问题的思想和对学生健康问题漠不关心的态度，会议遵照毛主席“健康第一”的方针，修正通过了关于学生健康问题的决定（草案）。
    最后，马叙伦部长说，在这次会议上，中等教育的方针明确了，任务提出来了，这任务是光荣的但又是艰巨的。实现这个方针，完成这些任务，因袭腐朽的资本主义国家的一套办法是不行的，我们必须总结中国自己的经验，并学习苏联的先进经验的精神和实质。这是摆在我们面前的新的课题。加以人力财力的限制，困难是会很多的。这就需要大家发挥高度的积极性与创造性，克服困难，创造条件，有步骤地求其实现。我们要丝毫不松懈地抓紧时间，进行教育事业的调整、统一、整顿、巩固的工作，打好基础，为发展准备条件，为迎接文化建设高潮的到来而奋斗！
