　　National Cooperatives Exceed Quota for Fertilizer Supply
    The National Cooperatives have exceeded the state-assigned task of supplying fertilizer, meeting the needs of farmers in inland areas who are growing cash crops. Because the demand for fertilizer from farmers in inland areas is very high this year, the state's fertilizer loan allocation is insufficient to meet the demand. Therefore, cooperatives in various regions have drawn a large amount of capital from their general business funds to manage fertilizer operations. The total capital of cooperatives nationwide engaged in fertilizer management exceeds the state allocation by 50%. By the end of March, cooperatives in North China, East China, Central South China, and Northwest China had purchased over 284,000 tons of various types of cake fertilizer, 10,000 tons of chemical fertilizer, and over 15,600 tons of oil residue, manure, bone ash, etc., for farmers. Among them, the Shandong Province Cooperatives had transported all the fertilizer to the application sites by the end of March. In Shaanxi Province, in addition to locally procured plant fertilizer, the required 600 tons of chemical fertilizer have also been transported to the application sites.
    In order to dispel farmers' concerns about the future sale of increased industrial raw materials, cooperatives in various regions, while vigorously promoting the sale of relatively inexpensive fertilizers, have widely signed pre-purchase, barter, and other contracts with farmers. In Fengyang County, Northern Anhui, 20,000 pre-purchase and barter contracts have already been signed with farmers. Of the more than 30 million jin of cake fertilizer sold in Pingyuan Province, approximately 60% is used to pre-purchase cotton and other products from farmers. Some cooperatives in some areas are also acquiring agricultural and sideline products through the supply of fertilizer, which is even more welcomed by farmers.

　　全国合作总社
　  超额完成供应肥料任务
    全国合作总社已超额完成国家委托的供应肥料的任务，满足了关内种植经济作物的农民对于肥料的需要。由于今年关内农民对肥料的需要很大，国家所拨肥料贷款不够应付，所以各地合作社在一般业务资金中抽出大量资金经营肥料。全国合作社经营肥料的总资金超过国家拨款的百分之五十。到三月底止，华北、华东、中南、西北各地合作社已为农民采购了各种饼肥二十八万四千多吨，化学肥料一万吨，油渣、大粪、骨灰等一万五千六百多吨。其中山东省合作社在三月底已将全部肥料运抵施肥地点。陕西省除植物肥料由当地采购外，所需化学肥料六百吨也已运到施肥地点。
    各地合作社为了解除农民怕增产工业原料将来销不出的顾虑，在大量推销比较廉价的肥料工作中，广泛地与农民订立了预购、易货等合同。皖北凤阳一县与农民订立的预购、易货合同已有二万份。平原省已销出的三千多万斤饼肥中，有百分之六十左右用于预购农民的棉花等产品。有些地区的合作社并通过供肥来收购农、副产品，更为农民欢迎。
