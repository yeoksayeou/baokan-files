　　"One household doesn't pull weeds, every household suffers from aphid pests" Jinxian County, Hebei Cotton Region Uproots Weeds to Prevent Cotton Aphids
To the Editor:
　　The cotton planting season is approaching, and cotton aphids are already hatching and breeding on several kinds of weeds. Farmers in Beipeng Village, Jinxian County, after listening to propaganda about preventing cotton aphids and learning about the lairs of "oil bugs" (i.e., cotton aphids), immediately began to dig up the *Ixeris dentata* (bitter lettuce), *Prunella vulgaris* (selfheal), *Viola yedoensis* (Edo violet), and *Plantago asiatica* (Asian plantain) from graves, well sides, ditches, and field ridges, taking them back to feed pigs or make fertilizer. Elementary school students from Beipeng Village, Yinjia Village, and other six villages also participated in weed-pulling activities to prevent cotton aphids during their after-school playtime. In five days of after-school time, the students of Yinjia Village Elementary School removed a total of 427 catties of *Ixeris dentata* and *Prunella vulgaris*.

　　Under the slogan "One household doesn't pull weeds, every household suffers from aphid pests," the work of preventing aphids and pulling weeds in the cotton region of Jinxian County is being carried out vigorously!

　　“一家不拔草，家家受蚜害”  河北晋县棉区拔草防棉蚜编辑同志：
    种棉花的季节就要到了，现在棉蚜已经在几种草上孵化和繁殖。晋县北彭家庄的农民，听了防治棉蚜的宣传，知道了油虫（即棉蚜）的老窝，他们马上开始把坟地、井边、水沟及地埂上的燕子尾（即苦苴菜）、臭蒿子（即夏枯草）、野茄子（即紫花地丁）及猪耳朵等草连根挖起来，拿回喂猪或沤粪。北彭家庄、尹家庄等六村的小学生，也利用课余游戏时间，参加了防治棉蚜的拔草活动。尹家庄小学的同学五天的课余时间，共铲除了燕子尾及臭蒿子等草四百二十七斤。
    在“一家不拔草，家家受蚜害”的口号下，晋县棉区的防蚜拔草工作，搞的很起劲！
