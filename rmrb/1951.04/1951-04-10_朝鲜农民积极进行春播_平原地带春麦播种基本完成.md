Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the government, spring sowing work in the rear rural areas of Korea is being actively carried out. Spring wheat sowing has been basically completed in the plain areas, and it is expected to be completed in the mountainous areas by the middle of this month. After sowing spring wheat, farmers will then start planting potatoes or corn, and prepare rice seedlings and repair irrigation ditches. In some areas, such as Yonghung County in South Hamgyong Province, the planting of potatoes has already been completed.

    War-stricken people in the war zone are receiving relief from the government and are enthusiastically participating in the production struggle of spring plowing and sowing. Up to now, disaster victims in South Pyongan Province, North Kangwon Province, and the suburbs of Pyongyang City have received more than 500 tons of barley seeds and hundreds of thousands of yards of coarse cloth lent by the state. By the end of March, farmers in the suburbs of Pyongyang City had borrowed 12 tons of seeds, more than 90 tons of grain, and more than 100,000 yards of coarse cloth, with an average of two to three dou of seeds and three to four yards of coarse cloth per person. Farmers in various places responded to General Kim Il-sung's call and actively helped disaster victims find houses, borrow clothes, bedding, and farm tools. Mutual aid teams also gave priority to assisting disaster victims in sowing.

    Spring plowing teams organized by staff and workers of various agencies and organizations are going to the countryside in batches to help farmers fill in bomb craters and cultivate the land. South Pyongan Province has also organized six cultural troupes to tour various rural areas from April 1st to comfort the farmers. Support and assistance from all sides are encouraging the broad masses of Korean farmers to increase grain production and support the front lines.

　　朝鲜农民积极进行春播
　  平原地带春麦播种基本完成
    【新华社平壤七日电】朝鲜后方农村的春季播种工作，在劳动党和政府的领导下正积极进行中。平原地带基本上已完成了春麦播种，山岳地带也可于本月中旬结束。农民们种完了春麦，接着就着手种马铃薯或玉蜀黍，并准备稻秧、修理水渠。若干地区如咸镜南道永兴县，已完成了马铃薯的播种工作。
    战区灾民得到政府的救济，正热烈地参加春耕播种的生产斗争。平安南道、北江原道及平壤市郊区的灾民，迄今已领到国家贷与的大麦种籽五百余吨、粗布数十万码。平壤市郊区农民截至三月底，已借到种籽十二吨、粮食九十余吨、粗布十万余码，平均每人可领到种籽二、三斗，粗布三、四码。各地农民响应金日成将军的号召，积极帮助灾民找房子、借衣服被褥和农具，各互助组并优先协助灾民播种。
    各机关、团体职工所组织的春耕队，正一批批地下乡，协助农民填平弹坑、进行耕作。平安南道并组织了六个文工团，从四月一日起前往各农村巡回演出，慰劳农民。各方面的支援和帮助，正鼓舞着朝鲜广大农民增产粮食支援前线的斗争情绪。
