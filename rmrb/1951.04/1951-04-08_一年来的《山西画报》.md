　　Editor's Note: This article was written by Comrade Li Qun, the person in charge of the "Shanxi Pictorial." The "Shanxi Pictorial" is a relatively successful local pictorial. We have already introduced it in the "Publishing Trends" column of the previous issue. Pictorials are an important tool for us to conduct propaganda and education among the masses; they must be closely related to the lives and needs of the masses, and must be promoted flexibly and deeply. The development and success of the "Shanxi Pictorial" provides a clear demonstration. We are publishing Comrade Li Qun's article to encourage comrades working on all local pictorials to observe and learn from the experience of the "Shanxi Pictorial" and improve their work.

　　The "Shanxi Pictorial" was published on February 5, 1950. By February 5 of this year, it had published 24 issues, with a total circulation of 196,750 copies. The number of subscribers has grown from the initial 2,125 to the current 15,290 subscribers both inside and outside the province. The number of contributors has grown from very few at the beginning to the current 146. It has done a lot of work and played a significant role in promptly conducting current affairs and policy education for the people of the province, promoting the Resist America, Aid Korea and anti-Yiguandao campaigns, providing lantern slide and wall newspaper drafts for the entire province, and cultivating and organizing mass art workers. According to our statistics, a total of 498 pictures were published throughout the year, of which 166 were about agricultural production, accounting for 33% of the total; 75 were about industrial production, accounting for 15% of the total; 22 were about the People's Liberation Army, accounting for 4% of the total; 9 were about marriage, accounting for slightly less than 2% of the total; 23 were about Sino-Soviet friendship, accounting for 5% of the total; 51 were about Resist America, Aid Korea, accounting for 10% of the total; 55 were about anti-Yiguandao, accounting for 11% of the total; and 97 were about winter studies, anti-superstition, and anti-bureaucracy, accounting for 20% of the total. Among these works, 411 were drawn by professional workers, accounting for 83% of the total, and 87 were submitted by the masses, accounting for slightly less than 17% of the total.

　　The "Shanxi Pictorial" was mainly created for the more than 80% of the peasant masses in the province. Because we deeply know that to transition our motherland from a new democratic society to a socialist society, improving the political and cultural education of peasants is an extremely important task. The "Shanxi Pictorial" has been warmly welcomed by the peasant masses of the province this year. For example, a reader's letter reported in the "Shanxi Peasant Newspaper" on January 10 this year said: Zhang Chengfa, a labor model from Hejin County, went back from a meeting in Taiyuan. The local Party school and militia training class asked him to convey the situation of the labor model conference. After his speech, he urged everyone to subscribe to the newspaper, saying: "The 'Shanxi Peasant Newspaper' and the 'Shanxi Pictorial' report a lot on the experience of organizing in our rural areas. My mutual aid team has already subscribed to 20 copies of the 'Shanxi Pictorial' and two copies of the Peasant Newspaper, as our veteran teachers in labor, to study technology and start a patriotic production competition with labor model Li Shunda." Under his influence, more than 40 out of the 100 students in the Party school (all of whom are rural Party members) immediately scrambled to subscribe to the newspaper. In less than two hours, they subscribed to 82 copies of the "Shanxi Pictorial" and 34 copies of the "Shanxi Peasant Newspaper." This shows the role that the "Shanxi Pictorial" plays in the countryside and the importance that farmers attach to it.

　　Once I went to the fourth district of Lingshi to collect painting materials, and I stayed with two rural women who were visiting relatives in Yangjialing. We happened to talk about Yiguandao. One of them advised everyone not to believe in it, and then began to publicize the crimes of Yiguandao. She told us a story about a person who mistakenly believed in Yiguandao and tried to ride a broom to heaven, and thus injured his leg. After she finished speaking, I was very surprised and quickly asked her where she heard the story. She said that she knew it after reading the "Shanxi Pictorial." From this accidental opportunity, I was greatly encouraged. There are many similar examples, and there are more stories in winter schools, which will not be listed here one by one.

　　Developing subscribers for the "Shanxi Pictorial" used to be a very difficult task, but developing subscribers is an important task. It is not enough to rely solely on the distribution section of the post office for this work. The experience of the past year has told us that the cultural centers and correspondents of the pictorial in various counties, as well as the readers of the pictorial, have done a lot of work for us. In addition, our comrades in the pictorial office seized the opportunity and did not let go of any object to carry out publicity. We promoted it on trains, at the industrial and agricultural labor model conferences, and on the way to the countryside... We promoted it to cadres and to the masses. For example, in Lingshi County, there were more than 60 subscribers. Due to our organization and publicity work, there are now 426 subscribers. Distribution work is a long-term work and also an in-depth propaganda work. According to the experience of labor model Zhang Chengfa in Hejin County in promoting distribution, if our publicity work is done well and the "Shanxi Pictorial" can be further improved, it is very promising to develop 200,000 to 300,000 subscribers in the province in the future. Because the level of agricultural production in Shanxi is gradually increasing, and the lives of farmers are improving accordingly, the cultural requirements of the broad masses of farmers will naturally increase accordingly.

　　The close combination of the "Shanxi Pictorial" with lantern slide work and the supply of lantern slide drafts is a new creation. We did not think of this problem when we first created the "Shanxi Pictorial." Later, because we vigorously promoted lantern slide propaganda, the cultural centers of various counties wrote to us asking us to provide some lantern slide drafts, because some of them could not draw, and some of them could not draw well. In this way, we realized that the "Shanxi Pictorial" should shoulder this task, so we paid attention to making the size of the comic strips published in the "Shanxi Pictorial" the same as the size of the lantern slide negatives; and we paid more attention to the content and structure of the comic strips to suit the lantern slide performance. Doing this really solved a major difficulty for the lantern slides in various counties. Now, according to our preliminary statistics, the 180 lantern slides in the province have an average of about 40% of their drafts adopted from the "Shanxi Pictorial," among which the comic strips for improving agricultural production, opposing arranged marriages, Resist America, Aid Korea, and anti-Yiguandao are used more often. Not only does the "Shanxi Pictorial" provide drafts to lantern slides in various places, but the art workers of the cultural centers in various counties also submit their own original lantern slide drafts to the "Shanxi Pictorial," making the "Shanxi Pictorial" and lantern slide work close friends.

　　The "Shanxi Pictorial" has indeed made considerable achievements this year. But there are still many shortcomings. From the statistics of the works throughout the year, the works of Resist America, Aid Korea and anti-Yiguandao are not many, and the manuscripts submitted by the masses are relatively few. In 1950, we drew a lot of comic strips on industrial production, introducing the active situation of the working class on the production front to the peasants, which was right and completely necessary; but we introduced too little about the arduous struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to liberate Tibet and to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and eliminate bandits and special agents. There are also too few introductions to the moving stories of the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army in the ice and snow to defend the country. In 1951, in order to deepen Resist America, Aid Korea and strengthen patriotic ideological education, we should strengthen current affairs pictures, publish more comic strips of the Chinese People's Liberation Army fighting and comic strips of the Chinese People's Volunteers resisting America and aiding Korea; in order to enhance news value, take root among the masses, and cultivate a large number of amateur mass art workers, we should publish a large number of mass manuscripts with real people and real events. This will surely make the "Shanxi Pictorial" more popular among the masses.

　　In 1951, in addition to the above improvements, we should also strengthen the comic strips on scientific knowledge, because promoting science is the most effective way to eliminate the feudal superstition ideas of peasants. But in 1950, we did almost nothing in this regard. Secondly, we should also write the explanatory text on the Shanxi Pictorial in a more popular way, so that the broad masses of peasants can easily understand it. This is also an important issue.

　　In order to successfully complete the above tasks, our working comrades of the Shanxi Pictorial Office must strengthen the study of current affairs, politics and policies; familiarize themselves with the lives of the masses, learn the language of the masses, and constantly improve their business, so as to successfully complete the important tasks given to us by the people of Shanxi.

　　一年来的《山西画报》
    力群
    编者按：本文是《山西画报》负责人力群同志所写。《山西画报》在地方性的画刊中是比较成功的一种，我们在上期《出版动态》栏中已经加以介绍。画报是我们对群众进行宣传教育的重要工具；它必须与群众生活和他们的要求密切关联，而且必须灵活深入加以推广。《山西画报》的发展与成功提供了鲜明的实证。我们发表力群同志此文，希望引起一切地方性画刊工作同志的观摩，吸取《山西画报》的经验，把自己的工作做得更好。
    《山西画报》在一九五○年二月五日出版后，到今年二月五日，共出版了二十四期，共发行了十九万六千七百五十份，由最初二千一百二十五个订户发展到现有省内外订户一万五千二百九十户；由最初很少的投稿者发展到现有投稿者一百四十六人。在及时向全省人民进行时事政策教育、抗美援朝与反一贯道宣传，推动工农业生产，供给全省幻灯和各地墙报壁画底稿，培养与组织群众美术工作者等方面做了不少工作，起了较大作用。据我们统计全年共刊载了四百九十八幅图画，其中关于农业生产的共一百六十六幅，占总数的百分之三三；关于工业生产的共七五幅，占总数的百分之十五；关于人民解放军的二二幅，占总数的百分之四；关于婚姻的共九幅，占总数的百分之二弱；关于中苏友好的二三幅，占总数的百分之五；关于抗美援朝的五一幅，占总数的百分之十；关于反一贯道的五五幅，占总数的百分之十一；其它关于冬学的、反迷信的、反官僚主义的共九七幅，占总数的百分之二十。以上这些作品，专业工作者画的共四一一幅，占总数的百分之八十三，群众的来稿共八七幅，占总数的百分之十七弱。
    《山西画报》主要是面对着全省百分之八十以上的农民群众而创办的。因为我们深深地知道，要使我们的祖国由新民主主义社会过渡到社会主义社会，提高农民的政治文化教育是一个极其重要的课题。这一年来《山西画报》是受到全省农民群众的热烈欢迎的。例如今年一月十日《山西农民报》的读者来信报道说：河津县劳动模范张成发，从太原开会回去，当地党校和民兵训练班请他传达劳动模范大会情形，他在传达之后，推动大家订报，说：“《山西农民报》和《山西画报》，对咱们农村组织起来的经验报道很多，我领导的互助组已经订了二十份《山西画报》、两份农民报，作为我们在劳动中的老师傅，好用来研究技术，和劳动模范李顺达展开爱国主义生产竞赛。”在他的影响之下，党校一百多学员（都是农村党员）当场就有四十二名学员，争着订阅报纸，不到两个钟头就订了八十二份《山西画报》和三十四份《山西农民报》。这说明《山西画报》在农村所起的作用和农民对于它的重视。
    有一次我到灵石四区搜集作画材料，和两个走亲戚的农村妇女一同住在羊家岭，偶尔谈起一贯道，其中的一个就劝大家不要信，接着就宣传开一贯道的罪恶了。她给我们讲了一个误信一贯道的人试着骑上扫帚上天，因而跌伤腿的故事。她讲完后，我很惊讶，连忙问她这个故事是从那里来的，她说是看了《山西画报》后知道的。从这个偶然的机遇中，给与我很大的鼓舞。类似这样的例子是很多的，它在冬学里有更多的故事，这里就不一一举出了。
    《山西画报》的发展订户，曾经是一件很困难的事，但发展订户却是一个重要的工作。这个工作单纯依靠邮局发行科是十分不够的。一年来的经验告诉我们，各县文化馆和画报的通讯员以及画报的读者们曾给我们做了不少工作。此外，就是我们画报社的同志们抓紧机会，不放松任何一个对象去进行宣传。我们在火车上，在工农业劳动模范大会上，在下乡的途中……遇到干部也宣传，遇到群众也宣传。例如在灵石县，原有订户六十余户，由于我们进行了组织和宣传工作，现在发展到四百二十六个订户了。发行工作是个长期工作，也是个深入的宣传工作。根据河津县劳动模范张成发推广发行的经验，如果我们的宣传工作做得好，《山西画报》并能更加改进，将来全省发展到二、三十万个订户是大有希望的。因为山西的农业生产水平逐渐上升，农民的生活跟着改善，广大农民对于文化的要求也就自然要跟着提高。
    《山西画报》在与幻灯工作紧密结合，供给幻灯底稿方面，是一种新的创造。当我们最初创办《山西画报》时并没有想到这个问题。到后来因为我们大力提倡幻灯宣传，各县文化馆来信要求我们供给一些幻灯底稿，因为他们有的是画不了，有的是画不好。这样我们才想到《山西画报》应该担负这个任务，于是就注意使《山西画报》上发表的连环画的大小与幻灯底片的大小相同；并更多注意连环画的内容与结构，以适合幻灯演出，这样一做果然为各县幻灯解决了一大困难问题。现在全省一百八十部幻灯，据我们初步统计，平均有百分之四十左右的底稿是采用《山西画报》上的，其中以提高农业生产、反对买卖婚姻、抗美援朝、反一贯道的连环画用的较多。不仅《山西画报》供给各地幻灯以底稿，而各县文化馆的美术工作者也以他们自己创作的幻灯画稿投向《山西画报》，使《山西画报》与幻灯工作结成亲密的朋友。
    《山西画报》这一年来，诚然是有不小的成绩。但缺点也还是很多的。从全年作品的统计中看，抗美援朝和反一贯道的作品还不算很多，群众的来稿发表的也相当的少。一九五○年我们画了不少工业生产的连环图画，把工人阶级在生产战线上的积极情况介绍给农民，这是对的，而且完全必要的；但把中国人民解放军为了解放西藏，和为了巩固人民民主专政肃清土匪特务而进行的艰苦奋斗，介绍的太少了。对于中国人民志愿军为了卫国保家在冰天雪地中与朝鲜人民军并肩作战的等等可歌可泣的故事，也介绍的太少了。一九五一年为了深入抗美援朝，加强爱国主义的思想教育，应该加强时事图画应该多刊中国人民解放军作战的连环画和中国人民志愿军抗美援朝的连环画；为了增强新闻性，在群众中生根，并大量培养业余的群众的美术工作者，应该大量登载真人真事的群众来稿。这样定能使《山西画报》更为群众所欢迎。
    一九五一年，除了以上的改进，我们还应该加强关于科学知识的连环图画，因为要扫除农民的封建迷信思想，提倡科学是最有效的办法。但一九五零年我们在这方面几乎没有做。其次，我们还应该把山西画报上的说明文字，写得更加通俗，使广大农民群众易于看懂，这也是一个重要问题。
    为了把以上的任务胜利完成，我们山西画报社的工作同志们必须加强时事政治学习与政策学习；熟习群众生活，学习群众语言，并不断提高业务，这样才能胜利完成山西人民给予我们的重大任务。
