    Ten years ago, on the day before Lunar New Year's Eve, Sasaki, the captain of the Japanese military police entrenched in Tangshan City, led more than 2,000 Japanese and puppet troops to surround this village, driving all the men, women, old, and young who had not had time to break through into the courtyard of Pan Huilin's house. The enemy set up a "killing field" here: the courtyard was covered with firewood and pine branches, and the surrounding area was filled with Japanese devils holding machine guns. After the villagers were driven into the courtyard, a brutal massacre began: bullets rained down, and the pine branches and firewood ignited a raging fire. Mothers holding infants, older sisters carrying younger brothers, and strong adults pulling the elderly struggled in the bullets and flames, collapsing in heaps into the fire and screaming... When almost everyone was dead, the Japanese stacked the corpses in a pile and burned them again, throwing those still alive back into the flames... The fire in Panjiayu soared into the sky, and the pillar of fire and thick smoke could be seen from more than ten miles away.
    After this bloody burning and killing, out of more than 1,500 people in the village, only 370-odd people remained, and all the houses in the village had become piles of rubble.
    Village Chief Pan Shanchun, whose wife was burned to death leaving only two legs, gritted his teeth and said: "Even jackals wouldn't be so vicious. Most of the thousand-plus people were women and children. When they finally searched out some women holding children in the village, they snatched the children from their mothers' arms, stripped them naked, and threw them to death. Some of the children hadn't even lived for a few days!"
    After the catastrophe, the people of Panjiayu fought even more tenaciously. The remaining young and strong men, after burying their relatives, immediately formed a "Revenge Squad," cooperating with the guerrillas led by the Communist Party to frequently wage guerrilla warfare and open up anti-Japanese work in more than thirty villages. They attacked at night and returned to the village for production during the day when the small tree on the mountain top (enemy situation marker - here indicating no enemy situation) was erected. They did not allow the enemy to use even a single blade of grass. Used buckets were sunk to the bottom of wells forty or fifty feet deep. In June of that year, the "Revenge Squad," in coordination with the main force of the guerrillas, fought in Ganhecao, Luanxian County, and killed Sasaki, the chief culprit of the Panjiayu massacre, on the spot. The anti-Japanese work in the village continued to be upheld, becoming one of the strongholds of the Jidong Anti-Japanese Base Area.
    Just as the villagers themselves said: even a blade of grass in Panjiayu is tough and unyielding! The people fought until victory, and then rebuilt their new homes from the rubble and thorns. The village's population has now increased from the three hundred and seventy-odd remaining after the disaster to one thousand and four people. More than three hundred new houses have been built, and more than sixty families will build new houses this year. The girls from the surrounding villages all love the heroes of this heroic village, and more than one hundred and fifty girls have married into this village. As a result, several hundred more babies have been added to the village. The terraced fields on the surrounding hillsides are as neatly arranged as steps. More than three hectares of new grape seedlings have been planted in the village. The tenacious will and vitality of the people of Panjiayu, like the lush pine forest on the southeastern hillside, shines with a rich green luster in the harsh winter.

　　潘家峪
　  ——人民斗争胜利的旗帜

    十年前旧历除夕的前一天，盘踞唐山市的日寇宪兵队长佐佐木率领日伪军二千多人，包围了这个村子，把没有来得及突围的男女老幼一齐赶进潘惠林家的大院。敌人在这里布置了个“杀人场”：院内铺满了柴草、松枝，四周站满了端着机枪的鬼子。村民被赶进大院后，一场惨绝人寰的大屠杀便开始了：枪弹像下雨一样地扫射了起来，松枝柴草烧起了烈火，母亲怀抱着幼儿、姐姐背着弟弟、壮年拉着老人在枪弹和火焰中挣扎着，成堆地倒在火里惨叫着……人死得差不多时，鬼子把死尸又垛在一堆再烧，把还活着的再扔进去。……潘家峪大火冲天，十几里外都能看见火柱和浓烟。
    经过这一场血腥的烧杀，全村一千五百多人，只剩下三百七十几个人，全村房屋已变成一堆瓦砾。
    老婆被烧死只剩下两条腿的村长潘山纯咬着牙说：“豺狼也不会有这样狠毒，一千多人大半是娘们和娃娃，在村里最后搜出几个抱孩子的妇女，又把孩子从妈妈怀里抢过去、剥了衣服赤条条的摔死。有些孩子生下来还没活几天呵！”
    浩劫后的潘家峪人民是斗争得更加顽强了。剩下的青壮年，埋葬了亲人后立即成立了个“复仇团”，配合共产党领导的游击队经常打游击，开辟了三十多个村的抗日工作。他们夜里出击，白天当山头小树（敌情标记——这里是表示无敌情）竖起时，就回村生产。他们连一棵草也不让敌人利用。用过后的水桶就沉在四五丈深的井底。当年六月，“复仇团”配合游击队的主力在滦县干河槽作战，把制造潘家峪惨案的祸首佐佐木当场击毙。村中的抗日工作一直坚持着，成为冀东抗日根据地的坚强堡垒之一。
    正像村民们自己所说：潘家峪的一棵草也是强硬不屈的！人们一直战斗到胜利，又在乱瓦荆蒿中重建起新的家园。全村人口现已由被难时剩下的三百七十多人增到一千○四人。新房已盖起三百多间，今年还有六十多家要盖新房。周围村的姑娘们，都爱恋着这个英雄村庄的英雄汉，已有一百五十多个姑娘嫁到这村。村子里的娃娃也因此添了好几百。村四周山坡的层层梯田，修整得台阶一样整齐。全村又新种了三顷多葡萄秧。潘家峪人民坚韧的意志与生命力，像东南山坡上葱郁的松林，在严冬闪着浓绿的光彩。
