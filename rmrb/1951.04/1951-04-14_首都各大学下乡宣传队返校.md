　　The propaganda teams from various universities and colleges in the capital have returned to school on the 7th and 8th of this month, respectively, generally after conducting propaganda in the countryside for three days. The breadth of this propaganda campaign is unprecedented. According to estimates from the six suburban districts, over 90% of farmers in the 10th and 12th districts have received education on resisting America and aiding Korea; in other districts, the minimum is over 60%. Peking University Medical College, the Heavy Industry School, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and the North China University of Technology, through mass meetings, group meetings, and individual visits, educated over 75,000 people on resisting America and aiding Korea. The propaganda teams from Peking University and Peking Union Medical College, which conducted propaganda in the 10th district, covered every corner, visiting households and educating people on resisting America and aiding Korea whenever they met someone. Over 90% of the farmers in this district received at least one session of propaganda education, with many having attended three or four sessions. Within three days, all villages in the district held signing ceremonies in support of the Five Great Powers concluding a peace pact and opposing the United States' arming of Japan, and around 90% of the villages established patriotic pacts. Seventy students from Tsinghua University conducted propaganda in Changxindian, holding forums with 94 communities representing various industries and religious groups, conducting propaganda tailored to the characteristics of each industry and religious group. They also performed plays four times and held accusation meetings, educating a total of over 16,000 people on resisting America and aiding Korea.

　　Teachers and students from various schools demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in their propaganda efforts. The propaganda team from Peking University Medical College not only carried out propaganda but also vaccinated children and treated measles. During a performance of "Old Granny's Accusation" by the Peking University cultural troupe, many farmers were moved to tears. Despite the strong winds and sand, the audience remained motionless. Students from the Department of Civil Engineering at Tsinghua University suggested that everyone should possess four things: "a set of principles, a set of skills (being able to speak and sing), a set of gifts (such as picture cards), and a good work style." More than a quarter of the students in the entire school could sing and perform. Students from the Beijing Railway Management Institute of Northern Jiaotong University, while conducting propaganda in the 16th district, adapted the crimes of Zhang Honghai, the local leader of the Yiguandao sect, into an opera called "Accusation of Zhang Honghai," which was very well received by the masses. Through this propaganda campaign, the consciousness of the masses was generally raised. A farmer from Zhengchang Village in the 12th district, after seeing the pictures and plays, said, "If one person hates in their heart, and everyone's hatred is twisted into a rope, then there is strength." An 83-year-old woman from Xiaying said, "Japan has harmed China enough, and the Americans are even more vicious than the Japanese. We must not let them come." Workers at the Jianxin Coal Mine in Mentougou, after receiving propaganda, increased their understanding of anti-Americanism and patriotism, and coal production has significantly increased. After the propaganda efforts of students from the Agricultural University, the farmers of Tiejiafen Village in the 13th district immediately donated 300,000 yuan to慰劳(offer comfort and appreciation to) the Chinese People's Volunteer Army; one farmer even donated two bags of flour.

　　The villagers generally welcomed the university teachers and students' propaganda efforts. They came out of the villages in groups to welcome them, warmly invited them to eat and stay, and sent them off a long way when they left, repeatedly shouting, "Come visit us more often in the future!" After the students went to the countryside, they were able to integrate with the farmers in their daily lives, eagerly helping them fetch water and sweep the floor. A female student from the Beijing Railway Management Institute of Northern Jiaotong University made more than twenty girlfriends in three days. Through this propaganda campaign, the teachers and students of various schools have all taken a step forward in their thinking. Everyone deeply appreciated the farmers' simple ways and sincere feelings. Professor Yu Zhenpeng of the Political Science Department of Tsinghua University cried several times when he heard the farmers' grievances. Thinking about the suffering the farmers had endured in the past, he worked even harder.

　　首都各大学下乡宣传队返校
    首都各专科以上学校下乡宣传队已分别于本月七、八两日返校，一般都在农村宣传三天。这次宣传的广泛性是空前的。据市郊六个区的估计，第十、十二两区农民百分之九十以上都已受到抗美援朝教育；其他各区最少亦在百分之六十以上。北京大学医学院、重工业学校、中央美术学院和华北大学工学院等四单位通过群众大会、片会和个别访问，向七万五千以上群众进行了抗美援朝教育。在第十区宣传的北京大学和协和医学院的宣传队走遍了各个角落，挨户访问，见人就宣传抗美援朝。该区百分之九十以上的农民都受到至少一次的宣传教育，多的有听过三、四回的。三天之内，全区各村都举行了拥护五大国缔结和平公约和反对美国武装日本的签名，百分之九十左右的村庄订立了爱国公约。清华大学七十个同学在长辛店宣传，分别在九十四个闾召开各行各业和各宗教团体的座谈会，结合各行业和各宗教团体的特点进行宣传，并演出话剧四次，还举行了控诉会，共计有一万六千余人受到抗美援朝的教育。
    各校师生在宣传中发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。北京大学医学院宣传队一面宣传，一面为儿童种痘和治疗麻疹。北京大学的文工队在演出《老大娘控诉》时，很多农民都掉下泪来。虽然风沙很大，但观众却一动不动。清华大学营建学系同学提出每一个人都应该具备四套东西：“一套道理，一套本领（会说、会唱），一套礼物（如画片），一套好作风。”全校四分之一以上的同学都会唱一套，演一套。北方交通大学北京铁道管理学院的同学在十六区宣传，把当地一贯道坛主张鸿海的罪行编成歌剧《控诉张鸿海》演出，很受群众欢迎。通过这次宣传，群众觉悟普遍提高。十二区郑常庄一个农民看见了图片和话剧后说：“一个人恨恨在心里，大家恨拧成一股劲，就有力量。”下营一个八十三岁的老太太说：“日本把中国害得够苦了，老美比日本更凶恶，我们决不能让它来。”门头沟建新煤矿工人经过宣传，提高了反美爱国的认识，煤产量已显著提高。十三区铁家坟全村农民经过农业大学同学的宣传以后，当场捐出三十万元慰劳中国人民志愿军；其中有一个农民捐了两袋面粉。
    老乡们对大学师生此次下乡宣传普遍表示欢迎。他们成群地走出村来迎接，热诚地招待他们吃和住，分别时又送出很远，并连连喊着：“以后要多来我们这里！”同学们下乡后都能在生活上与农民打成一片，他们抢着给老乡挑水、扫地。北方交通大学北京铁道管理学院一位女同学在三天内结识了二十多个女朋友。通过这次下乡宣传，各校师生在思想上都提高一步。大家都深切地体会到农民朴实的作风和真挚的感情。清华政治系余振鹏教授在听到农民诉苦时自己也哭了几回，想到农民过去所受的痛苦，他工作更带劲了。
