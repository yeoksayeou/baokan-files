Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editors:

    The February 21st issue of your newspaper published a reader's letter entitled "Leadership Organs in Xingshan County, Hubei Province, Should Improve Propaganda and Education Work." We are determined to accept this criticism and improve our future work. We believe that in propaganda and education work, we do have the following shortcomings:

    Newspapers were not managed uniformly, and it is indeed true that newspapers were used to paste walls. This was due to our vague understanding, thinking that using read newspapers to paste walls was more economical, and failing to understand that newspapers should be well preserved for reference. We have not promptly checked the distribution of newspapers in districts and villages, nor have we actively come up with ways to improve distribution work. We have also failed to educate cadres and the masses to value and cherish newspapers. We have not paid close attention to blackboard newspapers, allowing them to drift freely, resulting in blackboard newspapers with unsystematic and untimely content, merely existing as a formality.

    The issue of stockpiled current affairs propaganda manuals is as follows: Originally, we planned to train a group of vaccinators, so we kept about twenty copies, intending to distribute them so they could conduct vaccination work while simultaneously engaging in propaganda. Except for the phrase "more than two months" being somewhat inaccurate, everything else is correct.

    In response to the above situation, we have developed the following improvement plan:

    Educate the cadres and masses in our county to value newspaper study, and regard newspapers as a powerful weapon for propaganda and organizing the masses to promote work. We must cherish newspapers, and after reading them, we must pay attention to preservation for future reference. This should start with the county committee organs. Regularly convene blackboard newspaper meetings to discuss and study improvement methods, so that the masses like to read blackboard newspapers. All propaganda materials must no longer be stockpiled, and must be made available to the masses as quickly as possible. To this end, we will also specifically convene a meeting of relevant dispatch and receiving cadres from various units to develop improvement measures.

    The above is our self-criticism and improvement plan. We hope everyone will offer opinions to help us improve our work.

          The Propaganda Department of the Xing Shan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hubei Province

### 中共湖北省兴山县委会宣传部  拟订改进宣传工作计划

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　中共湖北省兴山县委会宣传部
    拟订改进宣传工作计划编辑同志：
    二月二十一日贵报发表了“湖北兴山县领导机关应改进宣传教育工作”的读者来信。我们决心接受这个批评，改进今后工作。我们认为在宣传教育工作中，确实有以下缺点：
    报纸没有统一管理，用报纸糊墙的确是事实。这是我们认识上模糊，认为看过的报纸，拿来糊墙比较经济些，不了解报纸应该很好保存，以便参考。对区村报纸的发行情况，没有及时检查过，也没有积极想出改进发行工作的办法。也没有教育干部和群众重视并爱惜报纸。对黑板报工作抓的不紧，任其自流。致使黑板报内容不系统，不及时，徒具形式。
    关于积压时事宣传手册的问题是这样：原先计划要训练一批种痘人员，故留了二十来本，打算发给他们让他们一边进行种痘工作，一边宣传。除了“两个多月”这一句有些失实外，其他都是对的。
    针对上述情况，我们研究出以下改进计划：
    教育我县干部和群众重视报纸学习，把报纸作为宣传和组织群众、推动工作的有力武器。一定要爱惜报纸，看过后要注意保存，留作参考。首先应从县委机关作起。定期召开黑板报会议，讨论研究改进办法，使群众喜欢看黑板报。所有宣传品不准再有积压现象，必须尽速使群众能看到。为此，还要专门召开各单位有关收发干部会议，做出改进办法。
    以上是我们的检讨与改进办法，希望大家提出意见，帮助我们改进工作。
          中共湖北省兴山县委宣传部
