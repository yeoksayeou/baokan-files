　　The Experience of Launching the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement in the Xuchang Region of Henan Province is Worth Learning
　　The Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement in the cities and villages of the Xuchang Region of Henan Province has achieved great results. Throughout the region, excluding Baofeng County which has no statistics, a total of 1,720,000 urban and rural people in the twelve counties of Xuchang, Changge, Yanling, Lin Ying, Yancheng, Wuyang, Ye County, Xiangcheng, Yuxian, Jiaxian, Linru, and Lushan, and the two cities of Xuchang and Luohe, directly participated in Resist-America, Aid-Korea rallies and demonstrations. Among them, Yuxian and Xiangcheng counties have seen more than half of their total population participate in rallies and demonstrations. The movement has yielded many benefits: it has raised the political consciousness of urban and rural people, repelled the counter-offensive of landlords and despots after the US invasion of Korea, suppressed counter-revolutionary elements, and promoted the review of land reform, the construction of people's armed forces, and grain collection and taxation. These are the main gains.
　　The experience of launching the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement in the Xuchang Region is worth learning. These experiences are:
　　(1) Mobilize all propaganda forces to carry out large-scale current affairs propaganda from top to bottom. In this regard, the first step is to train and cultivate cadres to carry out the movement. The common methods adopted by counties and cities under the jurisdiction of the region are: 1. Convene enlarged cadre meetings, 2. Hold current affairs training classes, 3. Hold symposiums, 4. Convene representative meetings of workers, peasants, youth, women, militia, and other sectors of the people for Resist-America, Aid-Korea. As of early March, nearly 110,000 propaganda cadres in the entire region (excluding Baofeng) had been trained using the above methods. This propaganda team went deep into the masses of all levels in various places, organized 1,112 Resist-America, Aid-Korea propaganda committees, and uniformly and systematically used winter schools, broadcasting, reading newspapers, slides, theatrical performances, and other methods to carry out propaganda, and universally mobilized and organized rallies and parades for Resist-America, Aid-Korea and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, with one township, several townships, or one district as a unit.
　　(2) Launch a large-scale accusation movement, promptly and thoroughly solve the ideological problems of the masses, and enlighten the political consciousness of the masses. It is far from enough to simply carry out propaganda from top to bottom; it is necessary to mobilize the masses to educate themselves with their own experiences. After the outbreak of the American war of aggression against Korea, the landlords and despots in the Xuchang Region took the opportunity to move around, spread rumors, and try to settle accounts with the peasants, attempting to restore their power. Under these circumstances, the leading organs of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement in the Xuchang Region immediately seized the opportunity to launch the "three investigations and one comparison" among the peasants, namely: investigate the enemy, investigate the current situation of the peasants being masters of their own affairs, investigate the reasons for their liberation, and compare their lives before and after liberation; and further tell the peasant masses that the counter-revolutionary activities of landlords and despots are coordinated with the American imperialist aggression against Korea, so that the peasants realize that "bandits, secret agents, landlords, despots, and American imperialism are one family." From accusing the crimes of landlords and despots, they went on to accuse the crimes of American and Japanese aggression and the crimes of American lackeys and Chiang Kai-shek bandits and secret agents harming the people. Through accusations, the peasants realized from their own personal experience that "to defend the fruits of liberation, we must Resist-America, Aid-Korea."
　　Carrying out the accusation movement can rapidly raise the political consciousness of the masses. This applies not only to peasants, but also to other classes. The Xuchang business community accused the US imperialists of destroying the bloody history of the Xuchang tobacco industry, the Linru intellectuals accused the US-Chiang secret agent training class, and the Luohe religious community accused the US imperialists of cultural aggression, all of which achieved great results. The broad masses, from their own personal experiences of poverty, unemployment, war damage, persecution by the US, Japan, and their lackeys, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and secret agents, found the truth that "every pain comes from US imperialism." In this way, the ideas of hatred for US imperialism and love for the people's motherland have been universally established among all classes.
　　(3) Elevate patriotic ideas to practical actions of patriotism and organize a climax of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement. In this regard, the main link grasped by the leading organs of the Xuchang Region is to combine the patriotic movement with the current practical work. In the Xuchang Region, the propaganda work of Resist-America, Aid-Korea is carried out in conjunction with the review of land reform work, opposing counter-revolutionary rumors, suppressing counter-revolutionary elements, mobilizing young peasants to join the army, mobilizing young students to participate in military cadre schools, and mobilizing the business community to actively pay taxes. The method is to guide the masses' patriotic enthusiasm to specific patriotic actions in current affairs education and grievance-telling movements in a planned and conscious manner, namely, the above-mentioned tasks. Facts have proved that this is entirely possible.
　　After the masses in various parts of the Xuchang Region improved their patriotic understanding through accusations, they launched struggles against the US lackeys, landlords, despots, and secret agents, conducted counter-settlements with the landlords and despots, and, under the leadership of the government, established people's courts, publicly tried and executed counter-revolutionary elements. After the masses went through class education of telling grievances and tracing the roots, and improved their political consciousness, they not only demanded to overthrow petty despots, but also demanded to overthrow the big despot - US imperialism. Many young peasants wiped away their tears at the grievance-telling meeting, demanding to join the people's armed forces, and raised their hands in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, vowing to arm and defend the fruits of liberation and consolidate the national defense of the people's motherland. Middle school students throughout the region also enthusiastically responded to the call of the motherland, and 4,000 people signed up to participate in military cadre schools, accounting for half of the total number of middle school students in the entire region. The business community universally launched a struggle against tax evasion in the patriotic movement.
　　(4) Establish a propaganda network for the people, consolidate the results of the movement, and make the movement sustainable. After the movement developed in depth, a large number of activists emerged. At this time, all parts of the region generally paid attention to developing propagandists in a timely manner and expanding the propaganda network. As of February 1, the entire region (excluding Wuyang County, which has no statistics) had 7,621 propagandists; at the same time, mass propaganda organizations such as newspaper reading groups, earthen broadcasting, blackboard newspapers, and rural theater troupes were universally established with Chinese Communist Party propagandists as the core. A total of 160,690 people participated in the activities of these organizations. In addition, 260,000 peasants in the region participated in winter schools, and they were trained to become the backbone of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea propaganda work. These ensure that the Resist-America, Aid-Korea propaganda movement can develop regularly and persistently.

　　河南许昌专区开展抗美援朝运动的经验值得学习
    河南省许昌专区各城市和乡村的抗美援朝运动已有很大成绩。全专区除宝丰县尚无统计以外，许昌、长葛、鄢陵、临颍、郾城、舞阳、叶县、襄城、禹县、郏县、临汝、鲁山十二个县和许昌、漯河两个市直接参加抗美援朝集会和示威游行的城乡人民，共达一百七十二万人。其中禹县和襄城两县，参加集会游行的，已占其总人口的一半以上。运动的收获是多方面的：提高了城乡人民的政治觉悟，打退了在美国侵略朝鲜以后地主恶霸的反攻，镇压了反革命分子，推动了土地改革的复查、人民武装力量的建设以及征粮征税等项工作。这些就是主要的收获。
    许昌专区开展抗美援朝运动的经验是值得学习的。这些经验就是：
    （一）动员所有的宣传力量，由上而下大规模地展开时事宣传。在这一方面，首先是训练和培养开展运动的干部。专区所属各县市普遍采取的办法是：一、召开扩大干部会，二、举办时事训练班，三、举行座谈会，四、分别召开工人、农民、青年、妇女、民兵等各界人民的抗美援朝代表会议。截至三月上旬为止，全区（除宝丰外）用上述各种方法训练的宣传干部将近十一万人。这支宣传队伍深入各地各阶层群众，组织了一千一百十二个抗美援朝宣传委员会，统一而有步骤地采用冬学、广播、读报、幻灯、演剧等方式进行宣传，并普遍发动和组织了以一乡、数乡或一区为单位的抗美援朝和镇压反革命的集会与游行。
    （二）发动大规模的控诉运动，及时深入解决群众的思想问题，启发群众的政治觉悟。仅仅自上而下地展开宣传，是十分不够的，必须发动群众用自己的经验教育自己。美国侵略朝鲜的战争爆发以后，许昌专区的地主恶霸曾乘机活动，散布谣言，向农民进行倒算，妄图复辟。在这种情况下，许昌专区抗美援朝运动的领导机关立即抓紧时机，发动农民“三查一比”，即：查敌人、查农民自己当家作主的现状，查翻身的原因，比较解放前后的生活；并进而告诉农民群众：地主恶霸的反革命活动是与美帝国主义侵略朝鲜相配合的，使农民认识到“土匪特务、地主恶霸和美帝国主义是一家人”。又从控诉地主恶霸的罪行进而控诉美、日侵略的罪行及美国走狗蒋匪特务残害人民的罪行。通过控诉，使农民从切身体验中觉悟到“保卫翻身果实，必须抗美援朝”。
    开展控诉运动能够迅速地提高群众的政治觉悟，这不仅适用于农民，而且适用于其他阶层。许昌工商界控诉美帝国主义摧残许昌烟业的血泪历史，临汝知识分子控诉美蒋特务训练班，漯河宗教界控诉美帝国主义的文化侵略等都收到了很大的效果。广大群众从自己在旧社会遭遇到的贫困、失业、战争破坏、美、日及其走狗蒋匪帮特务的迫害等等亲身经验中，找到了“条条痛苦来自美帝国主义”的真理。这样，各阶层群众仇视美帝国主义，热爱人民祖国的思想就普遍地树立起来了。
    （三）把爱国思想提高到爱国的实际行动，组织抗美援朝运动的高潮。在这方面，许昌专区领导机关掌握的主要环节是：使爱国运动与当前的各项实际工作结合起来进行。在许昌专区，抗美援朝的宣传工作，是与土地改革工作的复查、反对反革命谣言、镇压反革命分子、发动青年农民参加军队、发动青年学生参加军事干部学校、发动工商界踊跃纳税等项工作结合起来进行的。方法就是：在时事教育和诉苦运动中，有计划、有意识地引导群众的爱国热情到具体的爱国行动，即上述各项工作中去。事实证明，这是完全可以做得到的。
    许昌专区各地群众经过控诉，提高了爱国认识之后，纷纷展开了反对美国走狗地主恶霸和特务分子的斗争，向地主恶霸进行了反倒算，并在政府领导下，设立了人民法庭，公审和枪决了反革命分子。群众经过诉苦、追根的阶级教育、提高了政治觉悟之后，不仅要求打倒小恶霸，而且要求打倒大恶霸——美帝国主义。许多青年农民在诉苦大会上，擦干了眼泪，要求参加人民武装，并在毛主席像前举手宣誓，要武装保卫翻身果实，要巩固人民祖国的国防。全区中学生也热烈响应祖国的号召，报名参加军事干部学校者达四千人，占全专区中学生总人数的一半。工商界在爱国运动中普遍展开了反漏税的斗争。
    （四）建立对人民群众的宣传网，巩固运动的成果并使运动持久化。运动深入开展之后，便涌现出大批积极分子。这时，专区各地普遍注意到了及时发展宣传员，扩大宣传网。截至二月一日为止，全专区（除舞阳县尚无统计外）已有宣传员七千六百二十一人；同时，以中国共产党的宣传员为核心普遍建立了读报组、土广播、黑板报、农村剧团等群众性的宣传组织，参加这些组织的活动的群众，总计已达十六万零六百九十人。此外，全区有二十六万农民参加冬学，他们被培养成为抗美援朝宣传工作的骨干。这些，保证了抗美援朝宣传运动能够经常和持久地发展下去。
