    Comic Strip Slide Shows Promoting Resistance Against America and Aiding Korea Are Most Popular Among Peasants

    Editor's Note: After the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea issued the call to ensure that everyone, everywhere in the country, receives patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea, many regions have paid attention to popularizing this education in rural areas. The various methods and approaches for conducting propaganda on resisting America and aiding Korea in rural areas, as introduced below, can serve as a reference for various localities.
  (I) Comrade Editor:
    To make the movement to resist America and aid Korea known to every household in our village, in addition to using oral propaganda, blackboards, and loudspeakers, we also held a comic strip exhibition, which proved very effective. The exhibition featured a total of one hundred and twenty comic strips (some were borrowed, and some we copied ourselves), covering topics such as the history of American imperialist aggression against China, American imperialism as the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, the atrocities of American imperialism in Korea, and American imperialism following the old path of Japan. During the exhibition, we took turns explaining to the audience. Even people from neighboring villages came to see it, packing the exhibition room. When people saw the brutality of American imperialism, they couldn't help but recall the atrocities of the Japanese devils in the past, and they gnashed their teeth in anger. Our village militia captain was extremely angry, picked up his rifle, and said bitterly: "If American devils invade China, I will definitely shoot them like this." At everyone's request, the comic strips were exhibited for three days. After seeing the exhibition, the masses gathered in small groups to discuss national affairs.

  (II) Comrade Editor:
    After returning from the Northeast Regional Propaganda Representative Meeting in Shenyang, I brought the new propaganda method I learned at the meeting—"earth movies" (slide shows)—to my village for screening. The results were very good. On the evening of January 22, more than 300 people attended the screening. Dahei Li said after watching: "This thing is really good. It involves both performance and explanation, so you can understand it after watching; unlike meetings, you can't remember just by listening." When showing the "film" of American soldiers using bayonets to stab Korean children to death and harming Korean women, Ren Suqin and Che Yuzhi gnashed their teeth and said: "American devils are really hateful! If we don't eliminate such inhuman things, can we still have good days?" Yu Jing'en, 47, said: "We cannot ignore the American devils' massacre of the Korean people. Although I am old and cannot join the army, I can still carry stretchers."

  (III) Comrade Editor:
    To further expand the movement to resist America and aid Korea, on March 13, we and two comrades from the county cultural center took slide projectors and radios to the countryside for key propaganda work. During this period, we found that the masses really liked listening to the radio. Every evening when the radio broadcast began, people from ten miles away would come; sometimes, there were as many as a thousand listeners. When we listened to the speeches of representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning home, the masses listened intently. After each broadcast, we would conduct propaganda on resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. After this propaganda, most of the masses had a further understanding of American imperialism. Some people reflected: "The radio has been brought to our village for us to listen to, which is all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership; after listening to the broadcast and speeches, I know that only by grasping production and resisting America and aiding Korea can we protect our good lives."

### 深入农村宣传抗美援朝漫画幻灯最受农民欢迎

    深入农村宣传抗美援朝漫画幻灯最受农民欢迎
    编者按：中国人民抗美援朝总会发出要全国每一处每一人都受到抗美援朝的爱国教育的号召后，许多地区已经注意向农村普及抗美援朝教育。下面所介绍的各种在农村进行抗美援朝的宣传方式和方法，可供各地参考。
  （一）编辑同志：
    为了使抗美援朝运动在我村做到家喻户晓，我们除了用口头宣传、黑板报以及广播筒等方式外，还举行了一次漫画展览，收效很大。展览的漫画共一百二十幅（有的是设法借来的，有的是我们自己临摹的），内容有美帝国主义侵华史，美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，美帝国主义在朝鲜的暴行，美帝国主义正在走日本的老路等。展览时，我们分头给观众讲解。连外村的群众都来看，把展览室挤得风雨不透。大家看到美帝国主义的兽行时，不由得就想起了过去日本鬼子的暴行，气得咬牙切齿。我村民兵队长气极了，端起步枪恨恨地说：“美国鬼子如果侵略中国，我非这样枪崩他不行。”在大家要求下，漫画一共展览了三天。群众看了画展，三五成群地都讨论起国家大事来。

  （二）编辑同志：
    我在沈阳开完东北区宣传员代表会议回来以后，把会上学到的新的宣传方式——土电影（幻灯），搬到我村放映。结果收效很大。一月二十二日晚上放映时，参观的群众有三百多人。大黑李看了说：“这个玩意儿可真好。连演带讲，看了可就明白啦；不像开会，光听记不住。”在放映美军用刺刀挑死朝鲜小孩、残害朝鲜妇女等暴行的“影片”时，任素琴和车玉芝咬牙切齿地说：“美国鬼子真可恨！像这样没有人性的东西，若不把他消灭了，我们还能有好日子过吗？”四十七岁的于经恩说：“美国鬼子残杀朝鲜人民，我们不能不理。虽然我岁数大了，不能当兵，但我还能去抬担架啊。”

  （三）编辑同志：
    为了进一步展开抗美援朝运动，我们在三月十三日和本县文化馆两位同志携带幻灯和收音机下乡作重点宣传。在这一段宣传工作中，我们发现群众非常喜欢听收音机。每到晚上收音的时间，十里地以外的群众也赶来了；有时听众竟达千人之多。当我们收听中国人民志愿军归国代表讲话时，群众都聚精会神地听。每次广播完毕，我们就向群众进行抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传。经过这次宣传，大部分群众对美帝国主义有了进一步的认识。有的群众反映：“收音机子也搬到咱村叫咱听，这都是毛主席领导的好；我听了广播和讲演，知道只有抓紧生产，抗美援朝才能保住咱们的好日子。”
