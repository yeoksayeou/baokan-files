　　30,000 Teachers and Students in the Capital
　  Utilize Spring Break to Conduct Propaganda
　　Approximately 30,000 teachers and students from sixteen universities and colleges including the Capital's Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing Heavy Industry School, and eighty public and private middle schools are utilizing the spring break period to go in batches to the rural areas, railways, factories, and urban streets of the capital's suburbs to conduct extensive patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda activities. Teachers and students from specialized schools and above departed on the 5th, while teachers and students from middle schools will depart on the 9th; the activity time is generally scheduled for three days. More than 450 faculty members from Peking University formed 29 work groups, with over 90% of the faculty members from the science departments participating. All faculty members from the Chemistry and Physics departments went to the countryside to conduct propaganda. The 23 faculty members of the Chemistry Department formed a team, cooperating with the fourth-year students of the Chemistry Department to conduct propaganda in Dongbahe. They collected more than 270 pictures in advance, drew their own lantern slides, and created fast-clapper rhymes. Professor Ji Xianlin, the head of the Department of Oriental Languages, was very weak, but he still insisted on going. Professor Han Shou-xuan of the Museum Specialization Department had just had four teeth pulled, but he still wanted to go to the countryside to conduct propaganda. Wang Jian of the Peking University Education Union said: "In the past, the teachers always ran after the students for any work. This time, we are responding to the call of the Education Union, and the Union and the Student Union are cooperating to do it. We must complete this propaganda task well." Students from the Department of Civil Engineering at Tsinghua University drew more than 600 peepshow slides and more than 30 propaganda posters in two days, which can be used for propaganda by all teachers and students in the school. Professor Hua Luogeng, due to his difficulty in walking, could not go to the countryside to conduct propaganda. He said, "I will stay in the school to write letters to friends in India, Japan, Western Europe, and the United States, telling them about the various construction situations in New China, and do my part in the anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda work."

　　首都三万教师学生
　  利用春假展开宣传
    首都中国人民大学、北京大学、清华大学、协和医学院、北京重工业学校等十六院校及八十个公私立中学师生约三万人利用春假期间，分批赴首都郊区农村、铁路、工厂和市区各街道中进行广泛的抗美援朝爱国主义的宣传活动。各专科以上学校师生已于五日出发，各中学师生将于九日出发；活动时间一般均预定为三天。北京大学教职员四百五十余人组成了二十九个工作组，理学院百分之九十以上的教员都参加了这一工作，化学、物理等系全体教员都下乡宣传。化学系教员二十三人组成一队，和化学系四年级同学配合到东坝河宣传。事先他们搜集了二百七十多张图片，自己画幻灯画片，并创作快板。东方语文系系主任季羡林教授身体很弱，仍坚决要去。博物馆专修科韩寿萱教授刚拔掉四个牙，还是要下乡宣传。北京大学教育工会汪籛说：“过去什么工作都是先生跟在学生后面跑，这回我们响应教育工会的号召，工会和学生会配合起来搞，我们一定要好好完成这次的宣传任务。”清华大学营建系同学在两天内画了六百多张洋片和三十多张宣传画片，可供全校师生宣传之用。华罗庚教授因行走不便，不能下乡宣传，他说：“我要留在学校里写信给印度、日本、西欧和美国的朋友，告诉他们关于新中国的各种建设情况，做好自己一份抗美援朝的宣传工作。”
