　　Material Exchange Work in Hebei Province
    Li Li, Fei Jin
    Hebei Province is a vast plain area with a population of 30 million and abundant agricultural products. According to the statistics of agricultural and sideline production in 1950: cotton production has exceeded 13.1% of the pre-war normal production. Peanut production exceeded 77% of the pre-war normal production. The province produces 170 million catties of pears, dates, chestnuts, dried persimmons, black dates, peppercorns, almonds, walnuts and other mountain products, and more than 11.75 million catties of medicinal materials. Aquatic products such as fish and shrimp yield more than 75,000 tons. Therefore, except for the reduction in grain and fruit trees due to disasters, the general level has exceeded the pre-war level. This requires state-owned trading organizations at all levels in the province to purchase and regulate appropriately based on the surplus of agricultural and sideline products. State-owned trading organizations have researched various purchase and sales methods in the purchase and sales of agricultural and sideline products last year. First, consolidate and strengthen the business operations of state-owned trading companies and cooperatives on the existing foundation. In order to meet the needs of farmers, state-owned trading companies have appropriately adjusted their lower-level organizations. For example, the Hua Sha Bu (Cotton Yarn Cloth) Company moved the Wangdu Gaochang team to the city to solve the purchase of some areas in Dingxian and Tangxian; the Grain Company established a branch in Dingxing, and changed the Wangdu and Yixian teams to branches, etc. State-owned trading companies have also established joint purchase and sales organizations. For example, the Native Products Company established a comprehensive branch in Laiyuan County, which purchases mountain goods and native products on the one hand, and sells department stores on behalf of others at the same time; each company in Handan Prefecture has set up joint purchase and sales teams at cotton purchase locations according to needs. At the same time, organize distant sales teams to open up sales channels for local products. At the end of last year, the Provincial Native Products Company organized three distant sales teams to Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, and East China, carrying samples of native products to negotiate with brother companies or relevant departments in various places to exchange native products with each other. As of January 10th, it was agreed to start the exchange. The province shipped more than 240,000 catties of white melon seeds, dried persimmons, cauliflower, walnuts, peppercorns, etc., and 20,000 bolts of homespun cloth, and exchanged for 1.96 million catties of oil cakes from Chahar and Shanxi provinces. Contract business has also been strengthened between companies and cooperatives. Shijiazhuang Native Products Company signed a consignment contract with the Department Store Company, entrusting it to sell peppercorns, walnuts, bamboo products, etc. Local Hua Sha Bu companies entrusted cooperatives to purchase cotton (including credit purchase and exchange purchase), etc. Baoding City Company combined with supply and marketing cooperatives to order and purchase native cloth, pockets, fire saltpeter, chili peppers, hemp, etc. In addition, credit business was also developed. Wuan County Cooperatives carried out forward sales business, purchasing cotton on credit and handing it over to the company in exchange for cash to purchase grain in Shanxi Province. Sixty-four credit cooperatives were established in Daming County, mobilizing the masses to deposit real objects and lend them to mutual aid groups to purchase iron goods and farm tools; or using real objects as capital to purchase local reeds, sell them domestically, and exchange for daily necessities.

    Secondly, widely organize private merchants to conduct material exchanges. First, guide private merchants in purchasing and selling through seminars. For example, Handan Town convened a seminar for private merchants in nine major industries, enabling eighteen households in the mountain goods industry to organize before the Spring Festival, and the value of native products they managed reached 4.7 billion yuan. Second, organize joint operations and attract foreign merchants. For example, Handan Town, in addition to organizing temporary purchase and sales joint operations in this industry, also organized joint operations with foreign merchants to expand capital; and wrote letters to introduce market conditions and attract foreign merchants. In December last year, twelve merchants moved to Handan Town and Shijiazhuang from Hankou, Tianjin, Xingtai and other places. One merchant in Shijiazhuang alone purchased 400,000 catties of peppercorns. Third, develop credit business and sign reciprocal agreements with foreign merchants. For example, Handan Town and Zhangjiakou Grain Industry signed a grain purchase and sales agreement, mutually stipulating reciprocal conditions in grain sales business. The mountain goods industry in Handan Town also universally adopted the method of establishing credit agency purchases with foreign seated merchants. For example, the credit agency purchase amount of Tongyi Shop with a certain merchant in Hankou reached 30 million yuan; Qingfeng Pharmacy entrusted merchants in Shanghai and Hankou to purchase six times, saving 3 million yuan in travel expenses. In addition, it is also necessary to mobilize private merchants to well grasp the price difference between wholesale, retail and regions, appropriately take into account the interests of production, transportation and sales, and also take into account the existing purchasing power of consumers. After Shijiazhuang City adjusted the prices of native products, ten private cargo yards quickly joined forces to go to the countryside to purchase peanuts and other native products. Xianghe County in Tongxian Prefecture adjusted the regional price difference for transporting Baihe beans from the local area to Tianjin, making the transporters a net profit of 30 yuan per catty per trip. As a result, private merchants rushed to transport, and the market turnover increased by one-third compared with before the price difference was adjusted.

    Finally, vigorously organize the transportation power of the masses to restore and establish a commercial network. Hebei Provincial Transportation Company has established 33 transportation stations in all traffic arteries in the province. In addition to strengthening the state-owned transportation business, it has tried its best to give play to the transportation power of private boats and vehicles. Under the leadership of the Transportation Company's vehicles, private large carts can be flexibly mobilized throughout the province. In 1950, the mass transportation volume accounted for 79.1% of the total transportation volume. According to the statistics of Tangshan Prefecture for the three months from October to December, 6,050 private rubber-wheeled carts in the entire prefecture were mobilized to organize transportation; the profit for three months was equivalent to more than 17.34 million catties of millet. At the same time, the private cargo yard industry has been widely developed. In Cangzhen, Cangxian Prefecture, from July to December 1950, the private cargo yard industry increased by 90%, the number of people increased by 142%, and the capital increased by 631%. According to incomplete statistics in 1950, the private cargo yard industry in Huairou County sold more than 3.01 million catties of chestnuts, peanuts, walnuts, almonds, and dried apricots. In addition, it also sold a large number of local products such as medicinal materials, charcoal, and wood, and at the same time purchased the means of production and livelihood needed by the masses. The three private cargo yards of Sentai, Quanxing, and Tianju alone transported 1.16 million catties of millet and corn, satisfying the needs of some farmers in grain-deficient areas.

　　河北省的物资交流工作
    李梨　费金
    河北省境是有三千万人口的农产丰富的广大平原地区。据一九五零年农业和副业生产的统计：棉花产量已超过战前常年产量的百分之十三点一。花生产量超过战前常年产量的百分之七十七。全省产梨、枣、栗子、柿饼、黑枣、花椒、杏仁、核桃和其他山货等一亿七千万斤，产药材一千一百七十五万余斤。鱼虾等水产物产七万五千余吨。因而除粮食、果木因灾情减收外，一般均超过战前水平，这就提供全省各级国营贸易机构须根据该省农业和副业生产品的剩余情况，加以适当收购和调剂。国营贸易机构在去年开展购销农业和副业产品中，曾研究出各种的购销方法。首先，从现有基础上整顿与加强国营贸易公司和合作社的业务工作。国营贸易公司为适应农民的需要，适当地调整了下层机构，如花纱布公司把望都高昌小组撤到城内，以便解决定县、唐县部分地区的收购；粮食公司在定兴设立支公司，改望都、易县小组为支公司等。国营贸易公司并建立购销联合组织，如土产公司在涞源县设立一综合性支公司，一面收购山货土产，同时代售百货；邯郸专区各公司根据需要在收棉地点设立联合购销小组。同时组织远地推销小组，打开土产销路。省土产公司在去年年底，组织了察哈尔、绥远、山西、华东三个远地推销小组，携带土产样品，分别到各地与兄弟公司或有关部门协商互相交换土产。到一月十日商妥开始交换，由该省运出的有白瓜子、柿饼、花菜、核桃、花椒等二十四万多斤及土布两万匹，换回察哈尔、山西两省的油饼即达一百九十六万斤。在公司和合作社间又加强了合同业务。石家庄市土产公司与百货公司订立代销合同，委托代销花椒、核桃、竹货等。各地花纱布公司委托合作社购棉（包括赊购、换购）等。保定市公司结合供销社订购、代购土布、口袋、火硝、辣椒、麻等。此外还开展信用业务。武安县社开展期卖业务，赊购棉花交公司换得现款去山西省购粮。大名县成立信贷社达六十四个，发动群众存实，转贷给互助组办回铁货、农具；或以存实物为资金，收购当地苇子，内销后换回日用品。
    其次，广泛地组织私商进行物资交流。第一，通过座谈会指导私商购销。如邯郸镇召集了九个主要行业私商座谈会，使山货业十八户在春节前组织起来，经营土产的价值即达四十七亿元。第二，组织联营，招徕外商。如邯郸镇除本行业组织临时性的购销联营外，并和外地客商组织联营，以扩大资金；并写信介绍行情，招徕外地客商，去年十二月间，由汉口、天津、邢台等地迁移邯郸镇和石家庄的商户就有十二家，仅石家庄一家客商就收购花椒四十万斤。第三，开展信用业务与外商订立互惠协议。如邯郸镇和张家口粮业签订了粮食购销协议，互相订立销粮业务间的互惠条件。邯郸镇山货业又普遍采用了与外地座商建立信用代购的方式。如通益栈与汉口某商一家信用代购额就有三千万元；庆丰药栈与上海、汉口商户代购六次，就节省路费三百万元。另外，发动私商要很好地掌握批发、零售与地区间价格的差额，适当地照顾到产、运、销三方面的利益，且要照顾到消费者现有的购买能力。石家庄市在调整了土产价格后，十户私营货栈很快地联合下乡收购花生等土产。通县专区香河县调整了由当地运销白合豆到天津的地区差价，使贩运者每趟每斤有三十元的纯利。结果，私商纷纷贩运，市场成交量较调整差价前增加了三分之一。
    最后，大力组织群众运输力量，恢复与建立商业网。河北省运输公司，在全省各交通要道设立了三十三个运输栈。除加强国营运输业务外，尽量发挥私人舟船车马的运输力量。私营大车在运输公司车辆带动下，在全省内可以灵活调动。一九五零年群众运输量，占总运输量的百分之七十九点一。唐山专区，据十至十二月三个月的统计，全专区发动了六千零五十辆私人胶轮大车组织运输；三个月获利折小米一千七百三十四万余斤。同时又广泛地开展私营货栈业。沧县专区的沧镇，在一九五零年七至十二月份，私营货栈业增加了百分之九十，人数增加了百分之一百四十二，资金增加了百分之六百三十一。怀柔县城内私营货栈业，据一九五零年不完全统计，销出栗子、花生、核桃、杏仁、杏干三百零一万余斤。此外还销出药材、木炭、木料等大量土产，同时购回了群众所需要的生产和生活资料，仅森泰、铨兴、天聚三户私营货栈，就运来小米和玉米一百一十六万斤。满足了缺粮区部分农民粮食的需要。
