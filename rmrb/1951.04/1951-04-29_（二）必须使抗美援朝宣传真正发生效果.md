　　(II) Must Ensure Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Propaganda is Truly Effective

　　Recently, some places, in inspecting the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, have discovered that the propaganda and education of the masses is not thorough or specific enough, and even exhibits formalism. For example, the Jinzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party found that the Fukang Street in the city held fifty-eight meetings against the United States arming Japan in twenty-eight days, but still one-fifth of the masses did not know what was going on. Another example is Zhejiang Province, which found that in the signing of patriotic covenants, some were drafted by only a few cadres and passed at mass meetings; some were copied from newspapers and did not relate to their own work at all. Furthermore, some people, though they participated in actual actions such as rallies, parades, production competitions, and raising comfort and relief supplies, did not understand the meaning of these actions. This phenomenon was found among factory workers and street residents in Wuhan, Xi'an, and Jinzhou. Although these phenomena are only partial, they are still worthy of our vigilance.

　　The main reason for this phenomenon is that our propaganda work is not done well, not thoroughly, and not specifically. These propagandas are either too general, with empty content, failing to combine with the actual situation at the time and place and solve problems based on the masses' ideological conditions; or they are spoken too complicatedly and are not popular enough, so the masses cannot understand them; therefore, the masses are not interested in these propagandas. In such a situation, propaganda work will naturally not receive the due effect.

　　In order to further popularize and deepen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, it is necessary to resolutely correct this problem in propaganda work so that the people truly accept our propaganda. This requires, first, that the content of the propaganda must be closely combined with the actual situation at the time and place, combined with the immediate interests of the masses, and use examples familiar to the masses to illustrate the problem. Second, the content of the propaganda must be concise, taking into account the comprehension ability of the masses, focusing on explaining one or two issues at a time, so that the masses clearly understand several basic concepts. Do not say too much, too complicatedly, or use too many nouns and terms at once, so that the masses cannot digest them. Third, our propaganda (oral or written) must be done very popularly, so that the masses can easily understand and read it. Only in this way can our propaganda work truly be effective and welcomed by the masses.

　　（二）必须使抗美援朝宣传真正发生效果
    最近有些地方在检查抗美援朝工作中，发现了对人民群众的宣传教育不深入、不具体，甚至存在着形式主义现象。例如中共锦州市委会，检查出该市阜康街在二十八天内开了五十八个反对美国武装日本的会，但仍有五分之一的群众不知道是怎么一回事。又如浙江省检查出在爱国公约的签订上，有些只是少数干部拟定的，在群众大会上一读通过；有些是照报纸抄的，根本未联系本身工作。再如，有些地方的有些人民群众虽然参加了集会游行、生产竞赛以及募集慰劳品、救济品等实际行动，但却并不明白这些行动的义意，武汉、西安、锦州的工厂工人和街道居民中就发现有这种现象。这些现象虽然都只是部分的，但仍是值得我们警惕的。
    产生这种现象的主要原因，就是我们的宣传工作做得不好，做得不深入、不具体。这些宣传或者是太一般化，内容空泛，未能和当时当地的实际情况结合并针对群众思想状况解决问题；或者讲得太复杂、不通俗，群众听不懂；因而群众对这些宣传不感兴趣。在这样的情形下，宣传工作自然就不会收到应有的效果。
    为了使抗美援朝运动进一步普及和深入，必须坚决地纠正宣传工作中的这种毛病，使人民群众真正接受我们的宣传。这就必须第一，必须使宣传内容密切结合当时当地的实际，结合群众的切身利益，以群众所熟悉的事例来说明问题。第二，宣传内容必须简明，应该估计到群众的理解能力，一次着重说明一两个问题，使群众明确若干基本概念。不要在一次说得太多，太复杂，搬弄太多的名词术语，使群众不能消化。第三，必须使我们的宣传（口头的或文字的）做得十分通俗，使群众容易听得懂，看得懂。只有这样，我们的宣传工作才会是真正发生效果，并为群众所欢迎。
