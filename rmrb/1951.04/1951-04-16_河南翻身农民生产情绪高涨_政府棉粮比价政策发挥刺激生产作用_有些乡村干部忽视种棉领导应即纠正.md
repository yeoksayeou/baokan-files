Henan's Liberated Peasants Show High Production Enthusiasm
Government's Cotton-Grain Price Ratio Policy Plays a Role in Stimulating Production
Some Village Cadres Neglect Cotton Planting Leadership and Should Correct This Immediately
According to a letter from Yang Xiandong, Vice Minister of the Central Ministry of Agriculture, on April 10th from Henan, he visited Luoyang, Shanzhou, Lingbao and other places on March 25th to understand the rural situation. It is reported that: After more than ten years of natural disasters, wars, and displacement, the Central Plains peasants who have been allocated land are at ease in production and are very enthusiastic. The liberated peasants in western Henan all said: "After being allocated land, we don't have to worry about food in the first year, we can add farm tools and livestock in the second year, we can have all the farm tools and livestock in the third year, and we can live a good life in the fourth year." Many people used the fruits of the land reform review to purchase fertilizers and farm tools and invest in production, which has greatly increased the investment in agricultural production this year. However, some areas of Henan Province were still disaster areas last year. In these areas, there was a shortage of grain, draught animals, fertilizers, and feed. The people in these places, after years of disaster experience, are unwilling to relax their efforts in planting wheat and sweet potatoes, which has had a certain impact on expanding cotton fields. The leading organs attach great importance to the work of increasing cotton production. However, from the county level downwards, some district and township leading organs are still stuck on the distribution of numbers in the process of land reform turning to production. Some village cadres still have the idea that "production does not need leadership" and also lack experience in leading production. In short, although the work of increasing cotton production in Henan Province this year has received the attention of the leading organs, it still needs great efforts to implement it.
　　In 1950, the cotton-grain price ratio in Henan Province changed greatly. Before May, the cotton price was low. Since September, it has been maintained at a level of one to seven to seven and a half jin of wheat according to urban prices, but it rarely exceeded seven jin in rural markets. Due to the lack of cooperatives and purchasing agencies, there was a phenomenon that farmers had to wait for two or three days to sell cotton during the peak season of new cotton marketing. The problem of purchasing yellow cotton is also waiting to be solved. In western Henan, cotton flows from west to east, and wheat flows from east to west. Therefore, a contradiction has arisen between the cotton-grain price ratio policy and the regional price difference for cotton stipulated by the Ministry of Trade, which has caused considerable difficulties in the implementation of the cotton-grain price ratio.
    The government's regulation of a cotton price of one to eight jin of wheat this year is supported by the masses, and some local cadres believe that this ratio is not high in terms of actively rewarding cotton planting. According to our understanding, this price ratio has already played a role in stimulating production in some places.
    In terms of farmers' lives, according to our understanding in Luoyang and Lingbao, it is also fundamentally improving. The sales of industrial products such as rubber shoes, flashlights, and towels are also greatly increasing. However, the newly liberated farmers generally have a thin foundation, and most of them first use their funds to prepare food and purchase livestock and farm tools. In Pingle Village, Luoyang, we surveyed three mutual aid teams with a total of eighty-seven households. Before the autumn harvest last year, there were twenty-eight head of livestock, and now there are forty-six head of livestock; there were more than 300 students in the village attending school before liberation, and now there are more than 800 students. Gushui Village, west of Luoyang City, suffered a drought last year, and both cotton and autumn fields suffered a poor harvest. However, due to the good use of the fruits of the review and sideline production, the disaster victims did not flee, and the masses are saying: "Although last year was a disaster year, life was far better than the harvest years under the Kuomintang, no one fled, and no one wore ragged clothes."
　　Henan Province is planting flue-cured tobacco, and the tobacco farmers are very enthusiastic. Leading organs at all levels have also used great efforts and may over fulfill the task. However, there is not enough coal, and the transportation and distribution of coal is also an arduous organizational task.

　　河南翻身农民生产情绪高涨
    政府棉粮比价政策发挥刺激生产作用
    有些乡村干部忽视种棉领导应即纠正
    据中央农业部杨显东副部长四月十日自河南来信报道他于上月二十五日分赴洛阳、陕州、灵宝等地了解农村情况的结果。据称：经过十数年天灾兵祸颠沛流离的中原农民，分得土地安心生产，情绪十分高涨。翻身后的豫西农民都说：“分得土地后，第一年就不愁吃，第二年可添置农具牲口，第三年添齐农具牲口，第四年就过好日子。”很多群众将土地改革复查中所得的果实，购买了肥料、农具，投入生产，在今年农业生产上增加了很大的投资力量。但是去年河南省还有部分灾区，在这些地区，粮食、耕畜、肥料、饲料都感到缺乏。这些地方的群众经过连年灾荒的教训，对种植小麦红薯都不肯放松，因之，对扩大棉田受了一定影响。领导机关对棉花增产工作十分重视。但自县级以下，部分区乡领导机关在土地改革转向生产过程中，还停留在数字的分配上，有些乡村干部还有“生产不用领导”的想法，并且对领导生产也缺乏经验。总之，河南省今年棉花增产工作虽得到了领导机关的重视，但还需要尽很大的努力，才能贯彻。
    一九五○年河南省棉粮比价变化很大，五月前棉价偏低，自九月后按城市价格维持着一比七斤至七斤半小麦的水平，但乡村集市很少超过七斤。由于合作社及收购机构不够，在新棉上市盛期，曾发生农民等候两三天才能卖出棉花的现象。现在收购黄花的问题也待解决。在豫西，棉花是由西往东流，小麦自东往西流，因之，棉粮比价政策和贸易部规定的棉花地区差价间产生了矛盾，在棉粮比价的执行上造成了相当大的困难。
    今年政府规定的一比八斤小麦的棉价，群众都赞成，有些地方干部认为从积极奖励种棉上讲，这个比价并不算高。据我们了解，这个比价在有些地方已经发生了刺激生产的作用。
    农民生活方面，据我们在洛阳、灵宝了解的情况，也在基本好转，胶鞋、手电筒、毛巾等工业品的销售也在大大的增加。但是一般新翻身的农民底子还薄，多半是先把自己的资金用在准备食粮和购买牲口、农具等方面。在洛阳平乐村我们调查了三个互助组，共计八十七户，在去年秋收前有二十八头牲口，现在有四十六头牲口；全村在解放前上学的学生有三百多人，现在有八百多人。洛阳城西谷水村去年遭受了旱灾，棉花秋田都歉收，由于复查果实的利用及副业生产搞得好，灾民未逃荒，群众都在说：“去年虽是灾荒年，可是生活远胜过国民党时候的丰收年，没有逃荒的，也没有人穿破烂衣服。”
    河南省种植烤烟，烟农情绪很高，各级领导机关也用了很大力量，可能超额完成任务。但是煤炭不够，煤的运输分发也是一个艰巨的组织工作。
