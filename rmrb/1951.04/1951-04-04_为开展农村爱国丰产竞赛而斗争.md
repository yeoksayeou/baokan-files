　　Strive to Launch Rural Patriotic Production Increase Competition
	Pingan Tangyi County Production Increase Competition Has a Bias. To the Editor:
	The village-level cadre meetings held in various districts of Tangyi County, Pingyuan Province, in late February this year initiated a patriotic production increase competition. However, after examining the leading ideology, there are still many shortcomings.
	First, some cadres underestimated the patriotic enthusiasm and production initiative of the emancipated peasants, and therefore relaxed their leadership over the production competition. For example, the leaders of the Third District believed in advance that "the competition will not take off," so they were unprepared. When the competition did start, they still adopted a passive wait-and-see attitude, resulting in the competition running wild.
	Second, supported by a simple task-oriented viewpoint, the patriotic production increase competition was treated as a means of deploying work. This is most prominent in the First District. The county people's government's emphasis on this year's production tasks for the district was: expand cotton fields and dig one hundred wells. However, the leading cadres of the district subjectively required the entire district to dig two hundred and thirty-seven wells, and put forward the slogan "Completing the task is a hero, failing to complete the task is a dog," which one-sidedly guided everyone's emotions towards a competition in the number of wells dug.
	Due to the lack of correct leadership, the production competition in various districts of Tangyi County has resulted in the phenomenon of unrealistically pursuing numbers alone. The land in Jiang Wanghu Village in the First District contains a large amount of alkalinity, and the water is very salty, making it unsuitable for digging wells for irrigation. However, under the pressure of comparing numbers, they reluctantly accepted the task of digging two wells. In the Third District, the task of digging wells was initially difficult to assign, but after a challenge, the villages accepted it without careful consideration. As for how to complete the task, except for the Fifth District, there was generally no serious discussion. A cadre in a village in the First District said, "Our village will complete the task no matter what method we use," which implies the danger of completing the task by coercion, and the result will be detachment from the masses.
                                                                Wang Xiang

	Editor's Note: The shortcomings in leadership demonstrated by Tangyi County in the patriotic production competition are worthy of attention by all localities. Patriotic production increase competitions must be conducted on the basis of conscious voluntarism. Competition plans must be carefully discussed by the masses, and the conditions set should be practical and feasible, avoiding formalism of being ambitious and unrealistically pursuing superficial numbers.
       Enthusiastically Respond to the Challenge of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team  Letter from the Qiu Guanxing Mutual Aid Team in Xiaoshan, Zhejiang. To Comrade Editor, Please Forward to Comrade Li Shunda:
	The challenge of your mutual aid team to launch a patriotic production increase competition has given us great encouragement. Our team has discussed issues such as improving cultivation, repairing small rivers, preventing and controlling pests, and applying more fertilizer, and has formulated specific plans. Everyone has decided to express our love for the motherland with actions that increase production. Therefore, we accept your challenge and guarantee that this year each mu of land will produce 450 jin of rice, an increase of 10% compared to last year, reaching the level before the War of Resistance.
                                               Qiu Guanxing Mutual Aid Team, Qiujiaqiao, Xiaoshan, Zhejiang
           Letter from the Liao Renfu Mutual Aid Team in Hengyang, Hunan. To the Editor:
	We newly emancipated peasants were very excited to hear the news of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team's challenge to the whole country. Our team discussed the conditions proposed by the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team overnight and studied them according to our own situation. Now we want to achieve three plowings, three harrowings, more fertilizer application, and frequent weeding, and produce 480 jin of rice per mu, using these conditions to accept the challenge.
                               Hengyang Changhu Township Liao Renfu, Hu Guangli Mutual Aid Team
           Letter from the Yang Buhao Mutual Aid Team in Northern Shaanxi. To the Editor:
	The mutual aid team led by Yang Buhao, a labor model in northern Shaanxi, has decided to accept the challenge of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, an agricultural labor model in Shanxi Province. Before accepting the challenge, the Yang Buhao team held a meeting of party members, league members, and veteran farmers to discuss and study the challenge conditions of Li Shunda and formulated a challenge plan based on the specific conditions of northern Shaanxi as follows: deep plowing and careful cultivation, improving and increasing the planting of cash crops, to achieve an increase of 3.3 sheng of fine grains per mu (last year each mu yielded 2 dou, each dou is equivalent to 30 city jin), reclaiming 50 mu of wasteland, planting 150 mu of cash crops such as hemp and tobacco. In sideline production, raise 70 pigs, increase the number of chickens raised by 640, spin 100 jin of thread, weave 220 zhang of cloth, and plant 240 black willow trees.
                                                   Xu Feng
	Spring plowing preparation work should be done sooner rather than later.
	The "Not Too Late" mentality of Cadres in the First District of Yiyuan Caused Problems. To the Editor:
	The First District of Yiyuan County, Shandong Province, conducted a production inspection in mid-March and found that many district and village cadres had a blindly "Not Too Late" mentality. This blindly thinking that "It's not too late" actually made the spring plowing of the entire district late. The First District of Yiyuan has a total of 22,500 mu of spring耕地, a total of 231 head of cattle and 3,000 full and semi-laborers. Each head of cattle can cultivate up to 3 mu of land per day, and 13,800 mu of land can be cultivated in 20 days. In this way, just cultivating the land will take us past Qingming. The remaining more than 8,000 mu of land will take another 12 days to cultivate even if all the full and semi-laborers in the district are used (in fact, it is impossible to use all the manpower for cultivation). After this inspection, the blindly optimistic idea of ​​"Not Too Late" held by some district and village cadres was eliminated, and they have now begun to tense up.
                                                     Yiyuan First District Xin Nong
	Editor's Note: In order to realize this year's agricultural production increase plan, leading agricultural production must become the overriding central task in the countryside. The idea that certain district and village cadres in Yiyuan's First District blindly think "It's not too late" must be eliminated. The principle of "sooner rather than later" should be grasped, and leadership should be stepped up to lead farmers in plowing, delivering manure, and preparing seeds, first striving for a bumper summer harvest!

### 为开展农村爱国丰产竞赛而斗争

　　为开展农村爱国丰产竞赛而斗争
            平原堂邑县丰产竞赛有偏向编辑同志：
    平原省堂邑县各区在今年二月下旬召开的村级干部会议上，曾经发起爱国丰产竞赛，但从领导思想上来检查，还有很多缺点。
    第一，有一部分干部过低地估计了翻身农民的爱国热情和生产的积极性，因而放松了对于生产竞赛的领导。如三区领导方面因为事前认为“竞赛不起来”，所以没有准备。当竞赛起来之后，仍然采取了消极观望态度，结果竞赛形成自流。
    第二，在单纯任务观点支持下，把爱国丰产竞赛当作布置工作的手段。这一点在一区表现得最突出。县人民政府对该区今年生产任务要求的重点是：扩大棉田，打井一百眼。但该区领导干部却主观地要求全区打井二百三十七眼，并且提出“完成任务是英雄，完不成任务是狗熊”的口号，这就把大家的情绪片面地引导到打井数字的比赛上去了。
    由于缺乏正确的领导，堂邑县各区的生产竞赛就发生了不切合实际的单纯追求数字的现象。一区江王胡村土地含有多量碱性，水很咸，不能打井浇地。但是，在那种比数字的压力之下，也勉强接受了打井两眼的任务。三区打井任务起初分配不下去，经过挑战，各村便囫囵地接受了。至于如何去完成任务，除五区外，一般都没有认真讨论。一区某村干部说：“俺村无论用啥法都要完成任务”，这就隐伏着用强迫命令的方法完成任务的危险，其结果将会脱离群众。
                                              王相                               
    编者按：堂邑县在爱国主义生产竞赛中所表现的领导方面的缺点，是值得各地注意的。爱国丰产竞赛必须在自觉自愿的基础上进行。竞赛计划必须经过群众认真讨论，所订条件应该是切实可行，要避免好高鹜远、单纯追求表面数字的形式主义。
       热烈响应李顺达互助组的挑战  浙江萧山邱关兴互助组的来信编辑同志请转李顺达同志：
    你们互助组提出爱国丰产竞赛的挑战，给我们很大的鼓励。我们组已经讨论了改良耕作、修小河、防治虫害、多上肥料等问题，并订出了具体的计划。大家决定也要用增加生产的行动表示我们对祖国的热爱。因此，我们向你应战，保证今年每亩田产稻四百五十斤，比去年增加一成，达到抗战前的水平。
                               浙江萧山邱家桥邱关兴互助组
            湖南衡阳廖仁福互助组的来信编辑同志：
    咱们新翻身的农民听了李顺达互助组向全国挑战的消息，非常起劲。我们组连夜讨论了李顺达互助组提出的条件，并根据我们自己的情况研究了一下。现在我们要做到三犁、三耙，多下肥，勤锄草，每亩打稻四百八十斤，用这些条件来应战。
                                衡阳长湖乡廖仁福、胡光利互助组
            陕北杨步浩互助组的来信编辑同志：
    陕北劳动模范杨步浩领导的互助组，已经决定向山西省农业劳动模范李顺达互助组应战。杨步浩组在应战前，开了党团员和老农的会议，讨论和研究了李顺达的挑战条件，并根据陕北的具体情况，订出应战计划如下：深耕细作，改良与增种经济作物，达到每亩增产细粮三升三合，去年每亩打二斗，每斗合三十市斤），开荒五十亩，种麻、烟等经济作物一百五十亩。在副业生产上，喂猪七十口，增养鸡六百四十只，纺线一百斤，织布二百二十丈，植乌柳树二百四十棵。
                                                    许风
    春耕准备工作宜早不宜晚
    沂源一区干部“晚不了”的思想误了事编辑同志：
    山东沂源县第一区，在三月中进行了一次生产检查，发现不少区、村干部存在着盲目的“晚不了”的想法。这种盲目的认为“晚不了”，结果倒真的使全区的春耕搞晚了。沂源一区共有二万二千五百亩春耕地，共有二百三十一犋牛，三千个整半劳动力。每犋牛每天至多可耕地三亩，二十天可耕地一万三千八百多亩。这样一来，只是耕地就过去清明了。下余八千多亩地，即使用全区所有的整半劳动力都去刨，还要十二天才能刨完（事实上也不可能把所有的人力都用在刨地上）。经过这次检查，一部分区村干部“晚不了”的盲目乐观思想才被消除，现在已开始紧张起来了。
                                              沂源一区  新农
    编者按：为了实现今年的农业增产计划，领导农业生产必须成为农村中压倒一切的中心任务。如沂源一区某些区、村干部盲目地认为“晚不了”的想法，必须清除。应该掌握“宁早勿晚”的原则，抓紧领导农民耕地，送粪、准备种子，首先争取一个夏季丰收！
