To the Editor:

The Taiyuan Jinsheng Textile Factory Trade Union does not care enough about the workers' welfare and is doing nothing to help improve the situation as the factory's worker canteen collapses.

The factory, with the administration's money, opened a worker canteen in August last year. Because of poor management and expensive food prices, the canteen initially had more than 70 people eating there, but by February of this year, only four remained. Most other workers bring their own meals from home. They have a comfortable meal at home in the morning, but it is not the same at noon. The workers don't eat well and have complaints about the canteen, which everyone often argues about below. The trade union cadres are aware of these things, but they are unwilling to put their minds to helping improve the canteen; instead, they say that the canteen is run by the administrative secretariat and the trade union doesn't have to care.

The factory's worker canteen has certain material conditions, such as the administration providing 590 jin of millet per month to pay the cook and administrator's wages; over the past four months, a total of 2,700 pieces of coal briquettes have been subsidized. I hope that the factory's trade union can make full use of these material conditions, discuss it properly with the administration, and help the canteen improve its management methods to make it easier for workers to eat.

### 太原晋生纺织厂工会不应看着食堂垮台不管

    太原晋生纺织厂工会不应看着食堂垮台不管编辑同志：
    太原晋生纺织厂工会对工人的生活福利问题不够关心，眼看着该厂的工人食堂垮了台，也不帮助改进。
    该厂在去年八月，由行政出钱开办了一个工人食堂。食堂因管理不善，饭价昂贵，开始时有七十多人去吃饭，到今年二月，只剩了四个人。其他工人，大部由家里带饭来吃。他们每天早晨在家里吃一顿舒服饭，中午就不行了。工人饭吃不好，对食堂有意见，大家常在下边吵。工会干部对这些事是知道的，但他们就是不肯花点脑筋，帮助把食堂搞好；反说食堂是行政秘书科办的，工会可以不管。
    该厂的工人食堂是有一定的物质条件的，如行政上每月出五百九十斤小米，支付伙夫及管理员的工资；四个月来，共补助煤膏二千七百块。我希望该厂工会能充分利用这些物质条件，好好和行政上商量，帮助食堂改进管理方法，便利工人吃饭。
