Hebei Province's vast number of peasants, led by ten thousand labor models, have launched a high-yield emulation campaign. As of now, over thirty percent of farming households across the province, organized into over three hundred thousand mutual aid teams, have successively drafted this year's high-yield plans. The characteristics of these plans are: learning from last year's production increase experiences, a call for planting more cotton, expanding investment in production, improving technology, and further leveraging the role of mutual aid teams. Zhang Xishun of Niangniangmiao Village, Daming County, a province-wide model of mutual aid and technological improvement, issued a challenge to labor models throughout the province in mid-January to increase production, and has since received hundreds of responses. Xu Luomo, a cotton planting expert from Beipengjia Village, Jin County, in his response, plans to plant twelve mu of cotton on his eighteen mu of land. He plans to apply four thousand jin of stable manure per mu, and one hundred jin each of cottonseed cake and bone fertilizer. He aims to achieve the unit yield per mu of cotton field at Handan Farm (608 jin). Farmers in Nanzhongwei Village, Li County, who became prosperous through cotton planting, plan to plant 5,000 mu of cotton this year, exceeding the village's cotton planting area last year by 30 percent, reaching 70 percent of the village's cultivated land. Farmers in Xingtai County, who have already gained cotton planting experience, plan to plant 120,000 mu of cotton this year, more than double that of last year.

The province's peasants have already made preparations for this year's high-yield campaign during the patriotic production emulation movement last winter and spring. The preparation of fertilizer, improved seeds, agricultural machinery and tools, livestock, and farm implements by farmers in various regions has exceeded the preparations made during the same period last year by one to three times. According to a survey of 2,204 villages in the Baoding Special District, farmers accumulated over 20 million carts of fertilizer, averaging three to five carts of manure per mu, more than double that of last year. Furthermore, taking twenty-odd villages in ten counties including Anguo, Hejian, Nangong, and Daming as examples, the masses have purchased more than 4 million jin of bean cake, ensuring that most spring-sown land can be fertilized with fine fertilizer, roughly double that of last year. According to a survey of fifty-eight typical villages in seventeen counties across the province, farmers have purchased an additional 1,341 heads of livestock, over a hundred carts, and 1,266 important farm implements since last winter and spring. At the same time, governments at all levels have also opened many agricultural technology training classes to help farmers improve their farming techniques, with an average of two to three people per village receiving technical training. To support farmers in striving for high yields, the province's native produce company and cooperatives have supplied farmers with 250 million jin of fine fertilizer for spring planting.

The reason why Hebei Province's peasants have confidence in striving for high yields is that the production volume in general areas of the province has reached the pre-war production level, and farmers have the strength to expand investment in production. At the same time, farmers in the province continuously carried out appraisal and comparison campaigns last year. In the appraisal and comparison campaigns, universal comparisons were made in terms of technology, fertilization, cultivation, and seed selection and soaking. Through this mass appraisal, mutual teaching, and mutual learning, the production techniques of farmers have been universally improved. In addition, many high-yield creators emerged throughout the province last year, such as Handan Farm, which produced 608 jin of seed cotton per mu, setting a national record; Guo Jiaxiang of Xushui County, who produced 900 jin of millet per mu; and Ma Guorong of Changli County, who produced 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu, all setting North China records. These facts all indicate to farmers that it is entirely possible to improve farming techniques and achieve higher yields on the existing cultivated land area. The government's rewards and widespread promotion of these creations have even more powerfully inspired the confidence of peasants throughout the province to create high yields.

　　在上万的劳动模范带动下        
    河北广大农民展开丰产竞赛运动        
    三十余万个互助组先后订出计划充满争取丰产信心
    河北省广大农民在上万劳动模范的带动下，已展开了丰产竞赛运动。截至目前止，全省百分之三十以上农户所组织起来的三十余万个互助小组，已先后订出了今年的丰产计划。这些计划的特点是：吸取了去年的增产经验，要求更多地种植棉花，扩大对生产的投资，改良技术，以及进一步发挥互助组的作用。全省闻名的互助与提高技术的模范、大名县娘娘庙村的张希顺，在一月中旬向该省各地劳动模范发出增加生产的挑战书后，已接到数百件应战书。晋县北彭家庄植棉能手许洛墨的应战书中，计划将自己的十八亩土地种十二亩棉花。准备每亩施圈肥四千斤，棉籽饼、骨肥各一百斤。争取达到邯郸农场每亩棉田的单位产量（六零八斤）。种棉发家的蠡县南忠卫村农民，今年计划植棉五千亩，超过该村去年种棉面积百分之三十，达全村耕地面积百分之七十。已经取得植棉经验的邢台县农民，今年计划植棉十二万亩，超过去年一倍。
    全省农民已在去冬今春的爱国生产竞赛运动中，为今年丰产运动作好了准备。各地农民的肥料、良种、农用药械、牲口、农具等的准备，均超过了去年同期所作准备的一倍至三倍。据保定专区二千二百零四村的调查，农民积肥达二千余万车，平均每亩能施粪三至五车，超过去年一倍。另以安国、河间、南宫、大名等十县二十余村为例，群众已购买豆饼四百余万斤，大部春种地都能施上细肥，超过去年二倍左右。又据全省十七个县五十八个典型村的调查，去冬今春农民已增购牲口一千三百四十一头，大车百余辆，重要农具一千二百六十六件。同时，各级人民政府为了帮助农民提高耕作技术，还开办了很多农业技术训练班，平均每村有二至三人受到了技术训练。该省土产公司与合作社为支持农民争取丰产，已供应农民春种细肥达二亿五千万斤。
    河北省农民所以有信心争取丰产，是因为全省一般地区的生产量已达到战前生产水平，农民有力量扩大对生产的投资。同时，该省农民去年曾连续开展了评比运动。在评比运动中普遍进行了比技术、比施肥、比耕作、比选种浸种。经过这种群众性的评比，互教互学，普遍提高了农民的生产技术。加以去年全省出现了许多丰产的创造者，如邯郸农场每亩产籽棉六零八斤，创全国最高纪录；徐水县郭家祥每亩谷子产九百斤，昌黎县马国荣每亩甘薯产一万斤等，均创华北最高纪录。这些事实都给农民指出了在现有耕地面积上，提高耕作技术，达到更高的产量是完全可能的。而人民政府对这些创造的奖励与广泛宣传，更有力地鼓舞了全省农民创造丰产的信心。
