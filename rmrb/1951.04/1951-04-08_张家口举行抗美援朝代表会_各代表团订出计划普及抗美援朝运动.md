Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 7th—People from all walks of life in Zhangjiakou City held a representative meeting on Resisting America and Aiding Korea on March 25th and 26th. There were 465 representatives from 20 delegations representing various sectors and districts. At the meeting, the attending representatives reviewed the progress of the patriotic Resist America, Aid Korea movement in the past. Various delegations also formulated plans to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.

All representatives unanimously agreed that the development of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has raised the political awareness of the masses and has played a significant role in promoting various tasks. For example, the Ma Hengchang Group movement launched by the Telecommunications Bureau initially failed to gain traction. However, after the workers launched a movement to accuse the U.S. and Japan of their crimes, the workers' awareness was raised, and the competition movement was vigorously launched. At the meeting, the representatives also emphasized that the Resist America, Aid Korea movement is still not widespread enough, and some people are still standing outside the movement. Even among those who have received patriotic education in the movement, while their ideological understanding has improved, it still needs to be continuously enhanced and consolidated. Through the review and discussion at the meeting, the representatives more clearly realized that Resist America and Aid Korea is a long-term political task and must be continued with efforts.

At this meeting, each delegation formulated plans to popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement among the masses they represented and reported to the general assembly. The delegation of organs directly under the Chahar Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party emphasized the propaganda and education work for residents in its plan, stipulating that before April 20th, every resident around the organs under its jurisdiction must receive patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea at least once. The farmers' delegation's plan mainly focused on how to carry out the patriotic production increase movement. The industry and commerce delegation proposed in its plan: In April, a general inspection should be conducted on the implementation of the patriotic pledge by various industrial and commercial households, a tax payment competition should be launched, taxes should be paid on time, and local products should be vigorously promoted; assist the government in exposing counter-revolutionaries and corrupt elements in the industrial and commercial circles who disrupt the economic order; and vigorously organize industrial and commercial households to participate in current affairs study groups for a long time. The focus of the plan put forward by the Christian delegation was how to combine the Resist America, Aid Korea movement with the Three-Self Reform Movement. They specifically stipulated that before April 20th, every believer should hear a current affairs report on resisting America and aiding Korea at least once.

　　张家口举行抗美援朝代表会
　  各代表团订出计划普及抗美援朝运动
    【新华社张家口七日电】张家口市各界人民于三月二十五、六两日举行抗美援朝代表会议。出席会议的有各界、各区人民的二十个代表团四百六十五人。会上，出席代表检查了过去抗美援朝爱国运动开展的情况，各代表团并分别制订了关于普及深入抗美援朝运动的计划。
    各代表一致认为：抗美援朝运动的开展，提高了群众的政治觉悟，对于各种工作起了很显著的推动作用。如电信局开展的马恒昌小组运动，最初一直搞不起来，但在职工中开展了控诉美、日罪行的运动后，工人觉悟提高，竞赛运动便热烈开展起来。会上，各代表并强调指出：抗美援朝运动还很不普遍，有些人还站在运动的外面。在运动中已经受到爱国主义教育的人，思想认识虽有进步，但也还须要继续提高和巩固。经过会议上的检查和讨论，各代表更明确地认识到抗美援朝是一个长期的政治任务，必须继续努力。
    在这次会议上，各代表团分别订出了在自己所代表的群众中普及深入抗美援朝运动的计划，并向大会作了报告。中国共产党察哈尔省委会直属机关代表团在计划中强调对居民的宣传教育工作，规定在四月二十日以前，一定要使所属各机关周围的居民，每人受一次以上的抗美援朝爱国教育。农民代表团的计划主要为如何开展爱国增产运动。工商界代表团在计划中提出：四月份要普遍检查各工商户执行爱国公约情形，开展纳税竞赛，按期完税，大力推销土产；协助政府检举反革命分子与扰乱经济秩序的工商界败类；并将大力组织工商户长期参加时事学习小组。基督教代表团所提计划的重点，是如何使抗美援朝运动和三自革新运动相结合，他们具体规定在四月二十日以前，每一个教徒要听到一次以上的抗美援朝时事报告。
