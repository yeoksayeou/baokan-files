　  Tsinghua University Faculty, Staff, and Students Write to Mayor Peng Zhen
  　Thanking the Government for Sternly Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries
To the Editor, forwarding to Respected Mayor Peng Zhen:

    Having heard the relay from the representatives who attended the expanded joint conference of the Municipal and District People's Representatives of Beijing, we would like to tell you what everyone is feeling.

    We have learned that the People's Government will severely suppress this group of counter-revolutionary elements whose crimes are heinous and deserve more than death, and everyone is overjoyed and shouting "Long live!" This meeting vividly demonstrates that the People's Government completely listens to the people and eliminates harm for the people.

    We recall the countless persecutions suffered at the hands of special agents before liberation during the "June 2nd," "July 9th," "August 19th"... Today, these deadly enemies of the people are finally being punished as they deserve. We thank the People's Government, thank Chairman Mao. In the future, we must assist the People's Government with even greater vigilance and fight to the end to thoroughly eliminate all remaining counter-revolutionaries.

    Thank you to the Beijing Municipal People's Government and your leadership.
          Respectfully, the entire faculty, staff, students, and housewives of Tsinghua University

　  清华大学师生员工致书彭真市长
  　感谢政府严厉镇压反革命编辑同志转敬爱的彭真市长：
    听了参加北京市市、区人民代表扩大联席会议的代表们的传达，我们想把大家的心情告诉你。
    我们知道了人民政府要严厉镇压这批罪恶滔天、死有余辜的反革命分子，我们每个人都欢欣鼓舞，高呼万岁！这次会议生动地表现了人民政府是完全听人民的话、替人民除害的。
    我们回想起解放前在“六、二”、“七、九”、“八、一九”……所受特务的无数次的迫害。今天，这些人民的死敌终于受到应有的惩治。我们感谢人民政府，感谢毛主席。今后我们一定要以更高的警惕性来协助人民政府，为彻底肃清一切反革命残余而斗争到底。
    谢谢北京市人民政府和你的领导
          清华大学全体师生员工和家庭妇女敬上
