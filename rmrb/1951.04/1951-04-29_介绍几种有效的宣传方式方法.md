Introducing Several Effective Methods of Propaganda
　　Zhu Yuan

After the widespread Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education campaign before and after the May 1st holiday, the task before us is to ensure that this propaganda and education work is carried out in a deep and sustained manner. To this end, we must study the existing methods of propaganda and consciously promote those that are the simplest, most accessible, and can be adopted frequently on a large scale. Below, we will introduce the following methods: reading groups, train propaganda, rural spring fairs, and people's cultural centers. In the future, we will also introduce other effective methods of propaganda.

Rural Reading Groups

Reading groups are a powerful tool for conducting regular current affairs propaganda in rural areas and have played a significant role in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. In Wenjia Village, Lushun City, some farmers initially had a fear of America. After the reading group members explained the situation, they understood that the United States was a paper tiger and the reasons for resisting America and aiding Korea. Farmer Zhao Fengyou even mobilized his son to join the volunteer army. After the reading group in Liudao Gou Village, Wudong, Suiyuan, publicized the atrocities of American imperialism in Korea, the masses raised the slogan "Beat the mad dog, catch the demons" (i.e., oppose American imperialism). The villagers also drew up a four-point plan for resisting America and aiding Korea. In Yuanshi, Zanhuang, Jianping, and other counties in Hebei, some reading groups spontaneously led the masses to make a batch of comfort bags for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Rural reading groups in Northeast China, Southern Jiangsu, and other places assisted the government in convening accusation meetings and current affairs forums, mobilizing the masses to vote against the United States arming Japan.

There are various "reading" methods in rural reading groups. Some adapted newspaper materials into clapper talks, drum songs, and duets to perform in streets, dining areas, cooperatives, and other places where the masses gathered. Some read newspapers in farmers' night schools and literacy classes, expanding the influence of propaganda through individual publicity by activists. Some places used mass rallies, residents' group meetings, or lectures in mosques where Muslims gathered to conduct reading, which also proved effective. Some rural reading groups in Zhejiang Province cut out photos and pictorials from newspapers and compiled them into wall newspapers, which were posted in public places and were very popular with the masses. Rural reading groups in Liuhe and other places in Liaodong also led the masses to establish small libraries with hundreds of propaganda pamphlets, enabling the masses to study current affairs regularly.

Local experiences show that when reading to the masses, the readers should select materials according to the propaganda center and the current local situation, so that the propaganda effect will be greater. After the materials are selected, they should be carefully studied to express the content in spoken language, opposing rote memorization. Storytelling is also a good format. It is also necessary to practice gestures and expressions in advance so that it is more vivid, realistic, and can better attract the masses. At the same time, large maps and pictures should be prepared as much as possible to assist in the explanation. After reading, casual talks and discussions can be held. Successful experiences in various places are "read, explain, and discuss." During the discussion, the reader should inspire and guide the masses, leading the discussion to the intended purpose.

How to consolidate and develop reading groups during the busy farming season in the future? The recent conference of reading group leaders in Wudong County, Suiyuan, decided that reading groups should be closely integrated with spring plowing, and reading group members should take the lead in participating in mutual aid teams, implementing reading at the fields, and carrying out current affairs propaganda to stimulate the masses' patriotic production enthusiasm. This method can be used as a reference for other places.

Rural Spring Fairs

From the Spring Festival to the wheat harvest, spring fairs are often held in rural areas. It has been proven that it is very effective to use the opportunity of farmers gathering at spring fairs to conduct current affairs propaganda.

Zhoukou City, Henan Province, recently held a spring fair that lasted for nearly a month, and farmers from far and near came to exchange goods. The city's Cultural and Educational Committee and the Resist America, Aid Korea branch used this conference to carry out planned publicity and education work. The city mobilized thirty-five blackboards to report on typical accusation materials in the city. They also used folk forms such as stilts, lions, and land boats to sing songs and clapper talks about resisting America and aiding Korea. Programs such as "Crushing the American Paper Tiger" and "The Heroic People's Volunteer Army" were the most popular among the masses, with some people traveling from a hundred miles away to see them. The broadcasting station broadcast current affairs speeches and meaningful entertainment programs day and night. The city's People's Cultural Center also arranged a current affairs picture exhibition and showed lantern slides such as "The History of American Aggression Against China" and "The Story of the Korean War" every night. All the ballad singers were mobilized to sing meaningful operas, and the Drama Association was responsible for checking, offering criticism and praise. In addition, students and office cadres were also mobilized to publicize materials such as "World Peace Council Declaration" and "Oppose the United States Arming Japan." The method was to divide into groups and conduct individual conversations with the masses. This propaganda in Zhoukou City was very effective.

People's Cultural Centers

Many People's Cultural Centers in Henan Province have vigorously carried out current affairs propaganda in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. This experience is worth referring to in other places. The publicity tools frequently used by cultural centers in various parts of the province include: 3,762 blackboards, 15 wired radios, 60 loudspeakers, and 142 writing services. Earth radios are available everywhere, with 208 in Xuchang County alone. Thirty-seven current affairs exhibitions and 179 current affairs forums were held successively, and six museums also held current affairs quizzes. A total of 272 plays and 143 traditional operas were performed in various places. Forty-one museums in counties such as Shanxian County regularly hold current affairs evening parties or lectures.

People's Cultural Centers in various parts of Henan Province also mobilized and organized other social forces to participate in the propaganda. For example, the Zhengzhou City Cultural Center mobilized all the city's institutions and schools to purchase 19 slide projectors. Under the leadership of the Cultural Center, they formed a brigade and teams, delineated projection areas, and the Cultural Center uniformly printed and distributed lantern slides for application, establishing a city-wide slide propaganda network in a planned and step-by-step manner.

The propaganda activities of cultural centers in various parts of Henan Province have achieved great results. During the donation movement, the Runan City Cultural Center alone received 2,703 comfort bags, more than 4,000 comfort letters, and a large number of other comfort items.

　　介绍几种有效的宣传方式方法
    朱原
    经过“五一”节前后的普遍的抗美援朝宣传教育之后，摆在我们面前的任务，就是要使这种宣传教育工作，深入持久地进行下去。为了这，就要研究现有的各种宣传方式方法，把那些最简便、最可以大量而经常采用的，加以有意识的推广。下面我们就来介绍读报组、列车宣传、农村春会、人民文化馆这几种。以后我们还要介绍其他有效的宣传方式方法。
  农村读报组
    读报组是在农村中经常进行时事宣传的有力工具，在抗美援朝运动中起了很大作用。旅顺市文家村在抗美援朝运动初期，部分农民存在着恐美思想，经过读报组员宣传解释后，他们明白了美国是纸老虎以及抗美援朝的道理，农民赵凤有并动员了儿子去参加志愿军。绥远武东六道沟村读报组宣传了美帝国主义在朝鲜的暴行后，群众提出了“打疯狗，捉妖精”（即反对美帝国主义）的口号。全村农民并订出了四项抗美援朝计划。河北元氏、赞皇、建屏等县，有些读报组自发地领导群众做了一批慰问中国人民志愿军的慰问袋。东北，苏南等地的农村读报组，曾协助政府召开了控诉大会，时事座谈会，发动群众投票反对美国武装日本。
    农村读报组的“读报”方法是多种多样的。有的根据报纸材料编成快板，大鼓，双簧等在街头，饭场，合作社等群众聚集场所演唱。有的在农民夜校、识字班读报，透过积极分子的个别宣传，把宣传影响扩大。有的地方利用群众大会，居民小组会，或在清真寺借回民聚集讲道的时候进行读报，也收到很大效果。浙江省某些农村读报组把报纸上的照片，画刊等剪下来，编辑成墙头画报，张贴在公共场所，很受群众欢迎。辽东柳河等地的农村读报组并领导群众成立了拥有数百本宣传小册子的小型图书馆，使群众能够经常学习时事。
    在向群众读报时，各地的经验是：读报之先，读报员应根据宣传中心，及当时当地的情况选择材料，这样宣传效果会更大。材料选定之后，还要进行仔细研究，以便做到用口语来表达内容，反对死念条文。讲故事也是很好的形式。预先练习做手势和表情也是需要的，这样就更生动，逼真，就能更好地吸引群众。同时，应当尽可能地备有大幅地图、图画等配合讲解。读报之后并可举行漫谈讨论。各地成功的经验都是“一读，二讲，三讨论”。读报员在讨论中启发、诱导群众，把讨论内容引导到预定的目的上去。
    如何在今后农忙中巩固并发展读报组？绥远武东县最近召开的读报组长代表会议上，决定读报组要密切地与春耕相结合，读报组员要带头参加变工组实行地头读报，开展时事宣传，以鼓动群众的爱国生产热情。这种办法，可供各地参考。
  农村春会
    从春节到麦收这段时间，各地农村经常举行春会。利用春会时农民集聚的机会，进行时事宣传，已经证明是能够收到很大效果的。
    河南周口市最近举行了近一个月的春会，远近农民都赶来交换物资。该市文化教育委员会及抗美援朝支会利用这次大会进行了有计划的宣传教育工作。该市动员了三十五块黑板报在会上报道本市的典型控诉材料。并采用高跷、狮子、旱船等民间形式，演唱了抗美援朝的歌曲，快板等。所扮演的《粉碎美国纸老虎》《英勇的人民志愿军》等节目最受群众欢迎，有从一百里外专门跑来看的。播音站白天晚上都播送时事讲话及有意义的文娱节目。该市人民文化馆并布置了时事画片展览，每晚放映幻灯片《美国侵华史》，《朝鲜战争故事》等。所有曲艺人员都被动员来演唱有意义的戏，戏剧协会并负责检查，提出批评和表扬。另外，学生和机关干部也出动宣传《世界和平理事会宣言》、《反对美国武装日本》等材料。方式是分成小组，深入群众进行个别谈话。周口市这次宣传收效很大。
  人民文化馆
    河南省许多人民文化馆在抗美援朝运动中大力开展了时事宣传工作。这个经验，值得其他地方参考。该省各地文化馆经常使用的宣传工具计有：黑板报三千七百六十二块，有线电广播机十五部，喇叭筒六十个，问事代笔处一百四十二处。土广播各地都有，仅许昌一县即有二百零八处。先后举行了三十七次时事展览会，一百七十九次时事座谈会，有六个馆并举行过时事测验。各地共演出话剧二百七十二个剧目，旧剧一百四十三个剧目。经常举行时事晚会或讲座的有陕县等县的四十一个馆。
    河南各地人民文化馆并发动和组织了其他的社会力量参加宣传。如郑州市文化馆动员了全市机关学校，购备十九架幻灯机，在文化馆的领导下成立了大队、分队，划定放映地区，由文化馆统一印制灯片分发应用，有计划，有步骤地建立了全市幻灯宣传网。
    河南各地文化馆的宣传活动收到了很大的效果。在捐献运动中，仅汝南市文化馆就收到慰问袋二千七百零三个，慰问信四千余封，及其他大量慰问品。
