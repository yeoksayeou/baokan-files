　　On Suppressing Counter-revolutionaries Must Be Done With Great Fanfare
    Recently, the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries with great fanfare can be said to have been launched nationwide. Many places have made considerable achievements in resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries, which has been warmly supported by people from all walks of life. Following Beijing, Tianjin, and other cities, other cities have also successively launched the work. Recently, Nanjing City also began to mobilize the broad masses to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, with very good results. The existing experiences in various places have proven that, based on the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-revolutionaries, suppressing and handling a large number of counter-revolutionary elements with great fanfare, steadily, accurately, and ruthlessly, is an effective and indispensable measure to eliminate counter-revolutionary sabotage activities and protect the interests of the people and the country.
    What exactly constitutes "great fanfare"? This means convening people's representative conferences and consultative committee enlarged meetings at all levels to discuss the policy and implementation guidelines for suppressing counter-revolutionaries, exposing the crimes of counter-revolutionaries, and eliminating various ideological doubts, in order to mobilize people from all walks of life to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries. At the lower levels, two types of meetings should also be convened: one for representative figures and one for ordinary people. These meetings must be personally presided over by responsible leaders, and the public security organs should report on the situation of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, classify and introduce the materials of major cases and chief culprits, and use real people and real events to explain the necessity and justice of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and the correct policy of combining suppression with leniency. At these meetings, counter-revolutionary evidence, pictures, files, confessions, etc., must also be publicly displayed to raise the vigilance of people from all walks of life against counter-revolutionary activities, firmly stand on the revolutionary people's position, and strictly draw a line between themselves and counter-revolutionary elements. In particular, it is necessary to mobilize the strength of the masses to universally report and accuse counter-revolutionaries of their crimes, and suppress counter-revolutionaries by combining efforts from above and below. Whether in cities or villages, the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries should be made known to every household and understood by everyone. People from all walks of life should participate in or be involved in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and the people of the entire city should discuss and participate in this work, and everyone should jointly deal with counter-revolutionaries. We must resolutely break down the closed-doorism and mystification in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.
    Countless facts have proven that the ideological style of closed-doorism and mystification is completely wrong and extremely harmful. In some places, because the tendencies of closed-doorism and mystification have not been thoroughly overcome, and attention has not been paid to mobilizing the broadest masses to participate in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, these places have not yet given counter-revolutionaries a severe blow with great fanfare, forming a great weakness in the movement. Therefore, all localities should continue to strive to fully educate and mobilize the masses in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, raise the consciousness of the masses, and disintegrate and isolate the enemy. This is the central link in strengthening and guiding the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries at present. The experiences of various localities have already proven that as long as the policies are correctly grasped, the masses are mobilized, and the masses are relied upon to jointly suppress counter-revolutionaries, no mistakes will be made, and it will be able to fully conform to the interests and demands of the broad masses of the people.
    The people are enthusiastically demanding the resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, in places where the people's government accepts the opinions of the people and stands with the people to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary elements, social integrity is immediately upheld, and the enthusiasm of the masses is rapidly increased. The masses who previously complained that the government "did not support the people" immediately excitedly said, "We can straighten our backs" after seeing the government arrest a large number of counter-revolutionary elements. However, many people only see the arrest of counter-revolutionary elements and dare not actively rise up; they must see the people's government execute the chief culprits of counter-revolutionaries before they dare to boldly rise up and actively assist the people's government in reporting and accusing counter-revolutionary elements of their crimes. Now, in many places, because the people have seen the people's government execute the chief culprits of counter-revolutionaries, they all say, "Now we are not afraid to accuse," "We dare to report counter-revolutionaries." However, the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in some places is not yet sufficient, and they have not fully understood the necessity and correctness of suppressing counter-revolutionaries with great fanfare; nor have they seriously strengthened the propaganda and education work and persuasion work for suppressing counter-revolutionaries. That is to say, at present, in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the ideological style of small steps and timidity has not yet been universally and thoroughly corrected. Therefore, leading organs above the provincial level should organize several working groups with training and ability to be dispatched to various regions and counties to inspect and assist the local work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. If deviations are found, they should be helped to correct them in a timely manner; for cases that have been backlogged for too long, they should be helped to clear them up immediately; for those who dare not let go and mobilize the masses to suppress counter-revolutionaries, they should be taught how to mobilize the masses and help them carry out the work. Such working groups will be of great help to the resolute and correct development of the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Recently, Fujian, Guangdong, and other provinces have adopted such working groups to carry out the work and have achieved considerable results. Other provinces should also draw on this experience and send working groups to help carry out the work in areas where the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries has not yet been carried out; in areas where this work has already been carried out, working groups can also be sent to help inspect the work and summarize the experience. In short, the most effective methods must be used to launch a mass movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries with great fanfare.
    Some people say: "I am very much in favor of great fanfare, but don't arrest or kill the wrong people." This is very true. Suppressing counter-revolutionaries is an arduous task, and we must be very cautious and resolutely prevent any tendencies to act rashly. There are no such tendencies now, but we must prevent them. We must suppress all counter-revolutionaries, but we must never arrest or kill the wrong people. It is wrong not to arrest counter-revolutionary elements who should be arrested, and it is also wrong to arrest those who should not be arrested; it is wrong not to kill those who should be killed, and it is also wrong to kill those who should not be killed; it is wrong to give light sentences for serious crimes, and it is also wrong to give heavy sentences for minor crimes. The key is to be prepared, planned, and led. We must both let go and mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and implement strict control and unified command. Whenever and wherever counter-revolutionary elements are arrested and executed, it should be accurate, meticulous, planned, and step-by-step, and should be completely controlled by the responsible authorities above the special zone level. Recently, many places that have carried out the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries have proven that wherever this has been done, the results have been very good, and no deviations have occurred.
    During this period, many places have arrested large numbers of counter-revolutionary elements and executed large numbers of counter-revolutionary elements. Are not all the counter-revolutionary elements who have been arrested and executed guilty of irrefutable evidence and deserving of death in the eyes of everyone? Many places have held mass meetings of thousands, tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of people to accuse and publicly try those counter-revolutionary elements. We only hear a surge of anger from the masses demanding the immediate execution of counter-revolutionary elements, and many people have questioned why there are still many counter-revolutionary elements who have not been arrested and executed; but we have not heard anyone suggest that the wrong people have been arrested or killed. Why is this? Does this not prove that those counter-revolutionary elements have committed heinous crimes, owe countless blood debts, and the people can no longer forgive them? Does this not prove that the eyes of the people are discerning, and they are good at distinguishing right from wrong and distinguishing between friend and foe? Under such circumstances of correct leadership, sound policies, and the assistance of the broad masses, suppressing counter-revolutionaries with great fanfare can guarantee that no mistakes will be made. Therefore, the more the people's government does with great fanfare, the more counter-revolutionary elements will be afraid; the happier the people will be. Now, no place should show any hesitation in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries; no leading organ should continue to be indecisive on this issue. The successful experiences of many places are before us, and the broad masses are universally and enthusiastically acting and actively assisting us, supporting us in resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries. At this time, can we still fail to act quickly with great fanfare?

　　再论镇压反革命必须大张旗鼓
    最近这一时期，大张旗鼓的镇压反革命的运动，可以说已经在全国范围内发动了。许多地方坚决镇压反革命的工作，有了很不小的成绩，受到各界人民热烈的拥护。继北京、天津等各城市之后，其他各城市都先后展开了工作。最近南京市也开始发动广大群众坚决镇压反革命，成绩很好。各地已有的经验证明：根据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例，大张旗鼓，又稳、又准、又狠地搜捕与处理大批反革命分子，这是肃清反革命破坏活动，保护人民与国家利益的有效的不可少的措施。
    什么样才算是大张旗鼓呢？这就是要召开各级的各界人民代表会和协商委员会扩大会，讨论镇压反革命的政策和实施方针，揭发反革命的罪恶，消除各种思想疑虑，以便动员各阶层人民坚决镇压反革命。在下面还应该召集代表人物和普通群众的两种会。这些会议必须由负责首长亲自主持，并由公安机关做出镇压反革命情况的报告，分类介绍重大案件和首恶人犯的材料，用活人活事来讲解镇压反革命的必要性与正义性和讲解镇压与宽大相结合的正确政策。在这些会议上，还必须将反革命罪证、图片、案卷、供词等公开展览，提高各界人士对反革命活动的警惕性，站稳革命的人民的立场，与反革命分子严格地划清界限。特别是要动员群众的力量，普遍检举与控诉反革命的罪行，上下结合来镇压反革命。无论在城市和乡村，都要使镇压反革命的政策，成为家喻户晓、人人明白的事情。要让各阶层人士都去参加或与闻镇压反革命的工作，整个城市的人民都要讨论并参加这个工作，大家共同来对付反革命。我们要坚决打破在镇压反革命工作中的关门主义和神秘主义。
    无数的事实已经证明，关门主义和神秘主义的思想作风，是完全错误的，是极端有害的。有些地方，因为没有彻底克服关门主义和神秘主义倾向，不注意发动最广泛的群众参加镇压反革命的运动，以致在这些地方，就还没有大张旗鼓给予反革命以严重打击，形成运动中的极大弱点。因此，各地还应该努力在镇压反革命运动中，充分地教育与发动群众，提高群众的觉悟，瓦解与孤立敌人。这是目前加强与指导镇压反革命工作的中心环节。各地经验业已证明，只要正确掌握政策，发动群众、依靠群众，共同镇压反革命，就不会犯错误，而能够完全符合于广大人民群众的利益和要求。
    人民群众是热烈要求坚决镇压反革命的。因此，凡是人民政府接受人民群众的意见，和人民群众在一起，对反革命分子实行坚决镇压的地方，社会上的正气立即伸张，群众积极性迅速提高。过去埋怨政府“不给人民撑腰”的群众，看到政府逮捕了大批反革命分子之后，立刻兴奋地说：“我们可以挺起腰杆子了”。但是，有很多群众，只看到逮捕反革命分子，还不敢积极起来；他们一定要看到人民政府杀了反革命首恶之后，才敢大胆地起来，积极协助人民政府，检举与控诉反革命分子的罪行。现在已有许多地方的群众，因为看见人民政府杀了反革命的首恶分子，他们都说“现在我们不怕控诉了”，“可敢检举反革命了”。但是，还有些地方镇压反革命的工作，做得还不够，还没有充分了解大张旗鼓镇压反革命的必要性和正确性；也还没有认真加强镇压反革命的宣传教育工作和说服工作。这就是说，目前在镇压反革命的工作中，小手小脚和畏首畏尾的思想作风还没有得到普遍的彻底的纠正。因此，省以上的领导机关应该组织几个有训练、有能力的工作组，分别派遣到各地区、各县，检查与帮助当地镇压反革命的工作。发现有偏差的，应及时帮助纠正；对于积案太多的，应即帮助清理；对于不敢放手发动群众镇压反革命的，应该教给他们发动群众的办法，帮助开展工作。这样的工作组，对于坚决而正确地开展镇压反革命的工作，会有很大帮助。最近福建、广东等省采用这样的工作组来开展工作，已有相当成效。其他各省也都应该吸取这种经验，在镇压反革命工作未开展的地区，派工作组去帮助开展工作；在此项工作业已开展的地区，也可以派工作组去帮助检查工作与总结经验。总之，要用最有效的方法，大张旗鼓地展开镇压反革命的群众运动。
    有人说：“大张旗鼓我很赞成，可不要捉错和杀错了人。”这话很对。镇压反革命是一件繁重的工作，我们必须十分谨慎，坚决防止一切草率从事的偏向。现在并没有发生这样的偏向，但是，我们必须加以预防。我们一定要镇压一切反革命，但是一定不可捉错和杀错了人。对于反革命分子，该逮捕的不逮捕是错误的，不该逮捕的加以逮捕也是错误的；该杀的不杀是错误的，不该杀的杀了也是错误的；重罪轻判是错误的，轻罪重判也是错误的。问题的关键是要有准备、有计划、有领导。既要放手发动群众，依靠群众，又要实行严格控制，统一指挥。无论何时何地逮捕与处决反革命分子，都应当是准确的，精细的，有计划有步骤的，并且应当完全由专区以上的主管机关负责加以控制。近来许多进行了镇压反革命工作的地方，都证明凡是这样做了，成绩都很好，没有发生偏向。
    这个时期，许多地方已经大批地捉了反革命分子，大批地杀了反革命分子。所有已捉已杀的反革命分子，不都是证据确凿，人人皆曰可杀的吗？许多地方都开了几千人、几万人、甚至于几十万人的大会，控诉与公审那些反革命分子。我们只听到群众一片怒涛，要求立即处决反革命分子，并且有许多群众纷纷责问为什么还有很多反革命分子没有被逮捕与处决；却没有听到有谁提出捉错或杀错了人的。这是什么缘故呢？这难道不是证明那些反革命分子罪恶昭彰，欠下无数血债，以致人民群众再也不能饶恕它们了吗？这难道不是证明人民的眼睛是雪亮的，是善于辨别是非、分清敌友的吗？在这样有正确的领导、有完善的政策、有广大群众协助的情况下，大张旗鼓镇压反革命，可以保证是不会发生错误的。因此，人民政府越是大张旗鼓，反革命分子就越害怕；人民群众就越高兴。现在再也不应该有任何地方，对于镇压反革命的工作，仍然表现畏缩不前的了；再也不应该有任何领导机关，对这个问题继续优柔寡断的了。许多地方的成功经验摆在我们的面前，广大群众正在普遍地热烈行动起来，积极协助我们，拥护我们坚决镇压反革命，这个时候，我们还能够不大张旗鼓迅速行动起来吗？
