　　To the Editor:
　　I am from Gashi County, Xinjiang Province. I have two sons named Pan Zuhua and Pan Zuxin. During the Kuomintang rule, the world was unjust, and my two sons did not receive a proper family education. Since the People's Liberation Army came to Kashgar, the people have been liberated, and people's hearts have undergone great changes. My two sons have also become progressive and joined the revolution. Now they both work in the Gashi County government, saving money each month to support the family. From this small matter, I have felt the benefits that Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the People's Liberation Army have brought to the people. Moreover, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Gashi all abide by military discipline, engage in fair buying and selling, are peaceful in their attitude, and diligent in their work, which is truly admirable. When I was young, I often heard the old people say: If China ever has a day when "scholars do not love money and soldiers do not fear death," then the country will become strong. Now, the civil and military personnel led by Chairman Mao are all able to work hard for the happiness of the people. I have lived for sixty-nine years and worked in the postal service for thirty-two years. Now, seeing such a new China and a new world, my heart is truly joyful.

　　新中国、新世道  新疆一老人的来信编辑同志：
    我是新疆省伽师县人。我有两个儿子，名叫潘祖华、潘祖新。国民党统治时代，世道不正，两个儿子都不受家庭的教育。自人民解放军来到喀什之后，人民得到了解放，人心大变。我的两个儿子也上进成人，参加了革命。现在他们都在伽师县政府工作，每月节省费用，补助家庭生活。从这件小事上，我感到了毛主席朱总司令和人民解放军带给人民的好处。再说，驻在伽师的人民解放军一个个遵守军纪，公买公卖，态度和平，工作勤劳，真令人感佩。我在年青之时，常听老人说过：我们中国只要有一天“文不爱钱，武不惜命”，那就要强国了。刻下毛主席领导的文武人员，一个个都能为了人民的幸福艰苦奋斗。我活了六十九岁，干邮政三十二年，现在看到这样的新中国、新世道，心里真是喜悦。
