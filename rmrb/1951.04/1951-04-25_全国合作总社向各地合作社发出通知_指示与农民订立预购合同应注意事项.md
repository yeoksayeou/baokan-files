The All-China Federation of Cooperatives Issues Notice to Local Cooperatives:
	Instructions on Matters Requiring Attention When Concluding Pre-Purchase Contracts with Farmers

	The All-China Federation of Cooperatives has issued a notice requiring local cooperatives to pay attention to the following issues when concluding pre-purchase contracts with farmers: First, contracts should not be rigidly adhered to in form. According to local farmers' customs, forms such as old-style contracts and IOUs can be adopted, with the principle of clear responsibilities. Second, for the officially announced parities of kind and product specifications, the contract should earnestly guarantee them; the principle of "premium price for premium goods, lower price for inferior goods" must be implemented to dispel farmers' concerns and improve product quality. Third, the price of pre-purchased products must be based on the principle of mutual benefit and no loss to either party. Purely profit-seeking ideas are wrong, and the gratuitous view of not being afraid of losing money is also wrong. Fourth, pre-purchased products should mainly be industrial raw materials. If necessary, some wheat can be pre-purchased to meet the needs of urban consumer cooperative members. Fifth, clear guarantee responsibilities should be stipulated when signing the contract to avoid losses.

　　全国合作总社向各地合作社发出通知
　  指示与农民订立预购合同应注意事项
    全国合作总社发出通知，要求各地合作社在与农民订立预购合同时注意下列问题：第一、合同不要拘泥于形式，可根据当地农民的习惯，以责任分明为原则，老式契约、借据等形式都可以采用。第二、凡政府已公布的实物比价、产品规格，合同上应认真加以保证；必须贯彻优货优价、劣货低价的原则，以解除农民的顾虑，提高产品的质量。第三、预购合同必须根据双方有利、互不吃亏的原则作价。单纯营利思想是错误的，不怕赔钱的恩赐观点也是错误的。第四、预购的产品，应以工业原料为主，必要时可预购部分小麦，以满足城市消费合作社社员的需要。第五、合同签订时，应规定明确的保证责任，以免遭受损失。
