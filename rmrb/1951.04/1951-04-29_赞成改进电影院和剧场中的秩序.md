　　Supporting Improvements to Order in Cinemas and Theaters
To the Editor:
    The opinions raised by Comrade Dong Juxian in the People's Daily on April 15 regarding cinema management are very valuable. The following is a report on the specific improvement measures planned by this office for cinema management in Beijing:
    1. Regarding cinema facilities: Smoking rooms, tea rooms, ventilation, etc., will be improved at any time according to the economic possibilities of each cinema. Cinemas without smoking rooms have mostly used broadcasts and slides to inform the audience that "smoking is not allowed inside the venue." 2. Regarding the issue of cinema order and the issue of a small number of audience members leaving their seats early, affecting the view of those behind them, it is suggested that cinemas add slides to remind the audience to pay attention. 3. Regarding the issues of opening the doors early, lowering the curtain, and broadcasting records, it has been suggested that cinemas pay attention to improving these, and try to use "Resist America, Aid Korea" song records. 4. In order to do a good job in the people's film industry and make cinemas serve the people well, in addition to calling on cinemas to set up suggestion boxes, gather ideas, and improve work, this office, together with the Beijing Film Industry Association and the Beijing Film Industry Union, prepared to establish the Beijing Film Business Research Committee in early April. To study matters related to cinema management, equipment, projection technology, audience service, etc. 5. The equipment situation of the "Capital" cinema has been mentioned by Comrade Dong. The cinema's seats, ventilation equipment, etc., are being rebuilt as quickly as possible. "Dahua," "Youth Palace," "Beijing," and other cinemas are making further improvements in management, equipment, and other aspects.

To the Editor:
    Comrade Dong Juxian's opinions on "establishing good order in cinemas and theaters" have greatly encouraged our work.
    When the Youth Palace opened in February last year, it opened a lounge and purchased books, newspapers, and magazines for the audience to read during their rest. At the same time, it also stipulated rules for establishing theater order, such as no smoking inside the venue, no eating shelled foods; children under six are not allowed to enter when movies are shown; children under ten are not allowed to enter when plays are performed; no entry is allowed during the program, etc. Although there were some difficulties at the beginning, it later won the support of the majority of the audience. Only the rule that no entry is allowed during the program was not resolutely implemented because the audience was not used to it.
    Based on our experience over the past year and the suggestions made by the audience, we recently strengthened management when performing "Danniang". We insisted on the rule that no entry is allowed during the program, and stipulated that the audience should not walk around casually during the performance, and that the audience should not leave the venue before the program ends. We printed these new rules on the tickets and told them to the audience when they bought the tickets.
    At the beginning of the implementation, our work was made difficult due to a small number of audience members arriving late, but after listening to the patient explanation of the service comrades, they also expressed their support and were willing to jointly establish good order.
    We sincerely hope to get more help from the audience, and put forward criticisms and suggestions at any time to improve our work.

To the Editor:
    After reading Comrade Dong Juxian's opinions on us, we feel very ashamed. This is all due to the fact that our managers have failed to effectively take responsibility, and the shortcomings caused by the negligence of the staff in their work.
    We sincerely accept Comrade Dong's criticism. Now we are determined to correct our shortcomings. In order to correct the audience's habit of leaving their seats before the end of the show, we have made slides to advise the audience, and sent special personnel to persuade those who stand up before the show ends, not to hinder others from watching the show. Other shortcomings, such as opening the exit doors early and pulling the curtain early, have been corrected. We are determined to do our job well. We thank Comrade Dong.

To the Editor:
    On the evening of the 18th of this month, I went to the Youth Palace Theater to watch the poetic drama "Danniang" performed by the Wuhan Youth Cultural and Art Troupe. I was late at the time, and the first act had been playing for half an hour. The comrades in the theater would not let me in, saying that this was their new system, and that if I let me in now, it would affect the order in the venue and hinder others from watching the show. I think this makes sense, so I waited outside. It wasn't until the first act was over and the curtain closed that they let me in. Although I missed a little of the show, I not only did not feel any resentment about this, but I also think that the Youth Palace's establishment of this new rule is completely in line with the requirements of the audience.
            Zhang Yongyao
To the Editor:
    After reading Comrade Dong Juxian's opinions, I would like to put forward two more opinions.
    A part (or even most) of the audience often can't help but applaud when the plot is tense or exciting. In this way, not only can everyone not hear the sound clearly on the stage, but it is also easy to cause boos from another part of the audience, disrupting the theater order. I think: Good dramas and movies can be applauded to express praise, but it should be after the end of a scene or the end of the film. In addition to the audience consciously abiding by this point, theaters and cinemas can also use reports or slides to publicize it before the performance or screening.
    In order to help the audience in cinemas and theaters better understand the plot and gain more, I think it is very necessary to distribute plot descriptions before the screening. At present, cinemas in Beijing have not universally done this (as far as I know, Dahua, Capital, Victory and other cinemas have done so.), which does not cost the theater much, but it is of great help to the audience. Cinemas and theaters can also adopt a cooperation method with bookstores and shops, printing promotional advertisements on the back of the plot description, which can save some expenses.

### 赞成改进电影院和剧场中的秩序

专栏：读者来信

　　赞成改进电影院和剧场中的秩序编辑同志：
    四月十五日人民日报读者董聚贤同志对影院管理方面所提的意见是很宝贵的，兹将本处在北京市影院管理方面所拟制的具体改进办法报告如下：
    一、对影院设备：吸烟室、饮茶室、通风等，在各影院经济可能条件下，随时改进。凡未有吸烟室的影院，多已用“场内不可吸烟”的广播及幻灯片通告观众。二、关于影院秩序问题及少数观众提前离座影响后面视线问题，即建议各影院加映幻灯片，提起观众注意。三、关于提前开门，拉下帷幕及播送唱片等问题，已建议各影院注意改善，并尽量采用“抗美援朝”歌曲唱片。四、本处为了搞好人民电影事业，使影院很好地为人民服务，除号召影院设置意见箱、集思广益改进工作外，已于四月初，由本处会同北京电影业同业公会、北京电影业工会，筹备成立北京电影业务研究委员会。研究有关影院管理、设备、放映技术、观众服务等事项。五、“首都”影院的设备情况，已由董同志提到，该院的座椅、通风设备等，正在加紧重建。“大华”“青年宫”“北京”等影院管理、设备等方面正作进一步的改善。
            中国影片经理公司华北管理处编辑同志：
    董聚贤同志关于“建立影院和剧场中的良好秩序”的意见，对我们的工作有很大的鼓励。
    青年宫在去年二月开幕时，即开辟了休息室，购置了书籍、报纸、杂志等，以备观众休息时阅读。同时也规定了建立剧场秩序的制度，如场内不许吸烟，不许吃带壳的食品；演电影时，六岁以下小孩不许入场；演话剧时，十岁以下小孩不许入场；节目进行当中不许入场等规则。开始的时候，虽然有些困难，但后来却获得了广大观众的拥护。只有节目进行中不许入场这一条，因观众不太习惯，没有坚决执行。
    根据我们一年来得到的经验和观众所提的建议，最近我们在上演“丹娘”的时候，又加强了管理工作。坚持在节目进行中不得入场的规则，并规定节目上演时观众不得随便走动，节目未终止以前观众不要离场先走等项。我们将这些新的制度印在票上，并在观众买票的时候，讲给他们听。
    在开始执行时，由于少数观众来晚，曾使我们的工作发生困难，但当他们听了服务同志的耐心解释后，也就表示拥护，愿意共同来建立良好的秩序了。
    我们热诚希望得到观众的更大的帮助，并随时提出批评建议，以改进我们的工作。
                青年宫经理室编辑同志：
    我们看了董聚贤同志对我们所提的意见之后，感到很惭愧。这都是因为我们的管理者未能切实负责，以及职工们对工作疏忽所造成的缺点。
    我们诚恳接受董同志的批评。现在我们决心改正我们的缺点。为了纠正观众不等散场即行离座的习惯，我们已制幻灯片劝告观众，并在散场前派专人劝说那些起立的观众，不要妨碍别人看戏。其他如早开散场门，早拉幕帷等缺点，我们都已改正。我们决心要把工作搞好。谨向董同志致谢。
                  大华电影院编辑同志：
    本月十八日晚上，我到青年宫剧院看武汉青年文工团演出的诗剧“丹娘”。当时我去晚了，第一幕戏已演了半个钟头。剧场的同志不让我进去，说这是他们的新制度，还说如果让我现在就进去，会影响场内秩序，妨碍别人看戏。我想这话很有道理，就在外面等着。直到第一幕戏演完了，幕布关了，他们才让我进去。我虽然少看了一点戏，但是，我不但对这事毫无反感，并且我认为青年宫订立了这条新规则，是完全符合观众要求的。
            张永耀编辑同志：
    看了董聚贤同志所提意见后，我再提出两点意见。
    有一部分（甚至是大部分）观众，在剧情进行到紧张或精彩时，往往情不自禁地鼓起掌来。这样，不但使大家无法听清楚台上的声音，也容易引起另一部分观众的嘘嘘之声，破坏了剧场秩序。我认为：好的戏剧和电影，是可以鼓掌来表示赞扬的，但应该在一幕完结或影片映完之后。这一点除了观众应自觉地遵守外，剧场和电影院也可以在演出或放映前先用报告或是幻灯片的方式加以宣传。
    为了帮助电影院和剧场的观众，更好地了解剧情，得到更多的收获，我以为在影剧映演之前分发剧情说明书，是非常必要的。目前，北京市的电影院还没有普遍地做到这一项工作（据我了解，大华、首都、胜利等电影院已经这样做了。），这对院方的支出并不多，而对观众的帮助却很大。电影院剧场还可以采取与书店、商店的合作办法，在剧情说明书的背面印宣传广告，这样，更可以节省一些费用了。
