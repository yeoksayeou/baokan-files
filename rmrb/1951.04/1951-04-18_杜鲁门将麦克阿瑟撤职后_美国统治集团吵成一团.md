　　Truman's Dismissal of MacArthur Sparks Infighting Within U.S. Ruling Circles
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 17] The incident of Truman dismissing MacArthur has triggered new disputes within the U.S. ruling clique. Congressmen who support MacArthur and those who support Truman are blaming each other and are in a complete uproar. Dewey, one of the Republican leaders who not long ago had defended Truman's aggression line, issued a statement denouncing Truman's bankrupt foreign policy, saying that it "caused the free world (referring to the imperialist camp) to lose China, brought about the Korean War, and put our (the United States') allies in danger of splitting with us." Republican Senator Wherry even demanded Truman's resignation in order to "restore national unity and confidence." The House Republican Policy Committee also passed a special resolution condemning the Truman administration's Far East policy, believing that Truman's dismissal of MacArthur and the huge casualties suffered by the United States in Korea prove that the Truman administration is "incompetent" to achieve its own plans. The resolution also exclaimed that "the future of the United States (referring to imperialist America) is on the verge of crisis."
    Congressmen from Truman's faction defended by saying that there were compelling reasons for dismissing MacArthur, because "Truman faced a difficult situation that threatened the unity of the free world (referring to the imperialist camp)" (Democratic Senator Lehman); because of the "confusion of contradictory statements" by the United States on the Korean issue, "the allied world is falling apart" (Senate Democratic leader McFarland). From their mouths, it was revealed that one of the purposes of Truman's dismissal of MacArthur was to tie vassal states such as Britain and France more tightly to the chariot of war. This faction of congressmen also tried their best to shirk responsibility for the United States' disastrous defeat in Korea. House Democratic Leader McCormack demanded an inquiry into MacArthur to investigate "the serious military mistakes made in Korea."
    Truman's political maneuver of dismissing MacArthur, in addition to increasing the infighting within the U.S. ruling clique, cannot solve the U.S. government's embarrassing situation. Republican Senator Wiley of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said: "Removing MacArthur from his post does not solve any problems."

　　杜鲁门将麦克阿瑟撤职后
    美国统治集团吵成一团
    【新华社十七日讯】杜鲁门将麦克阿瑟撤职的事件，在美国统治集团内部引起了新的争吵。拥护麦克阿瑟的和支持杜鲁门的议员相互责怪，吵作一团。不久以前还出力为杜鲁门的侵略路线作过辩护的共和党首领之一的杜威发表声明，斥责杜鲁门的破产的外交政策“使自由世界（按指帝国主义阵营）失掉了中国，带来了朝鲜战争，并使我们（美国）的盟国与我们有分裂的危险”。共和党参议员威尔克并要求杜鲁门辞职，以便“恢复全国的团结和信心”。众院的共和党政策委员会还通过了一项特别决议，谴责杜鲁门政府的远东政策，认为杜鲁门之撤除麦克阿瑟以及美国在朝鲜的巨大伤亡，证明杜鲁门政府“无能”达成它自己的计划。决议并惊呼“美国（按指帝国主义的美国）的前途已濒于危境”。
    杜鲁门派的议员则辩护说，撤掉麦克阿瑟是有迫不得已的苦衷，因为“杜鲁门面临着一个有危及自由世界（按指帝国主义阵营）团结之虞的困难局面”（民主党参议员李汉）；因为由于美国在朝鲜问题上“相互矛盾的声明的混乱”，“盟国世界已在分崩离析中”（参院民主党首脑麦克法兰）。从他们的口中透露：杜鲁门的撤销麦克阿瑟职务目的之一，是把英法等附庸国更加紧紧地缚在战争的车轮上。这派议员并竭力替杜鲁门推卸美国在朝鲜惨败的责任。众院民主党领袖马考麦克要求对麦克阿瑟提出质询，检查“在朝鲜犯下的严重军事错误”。
    杜鲁门这一撤销麦克阿瑟职务的权术行动，除了增加美国统治集团内部的争吵之外，并不能解决美国政府的窘迫的处境。参院外委会共和党委员维利就说：“解除麦克阿瑟的职务，并不能解决任何问题。”
