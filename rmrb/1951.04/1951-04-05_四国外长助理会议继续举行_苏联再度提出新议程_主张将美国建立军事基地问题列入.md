Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The assistants to the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France held their twentieth meeting on March 30, chaired by the US representative, Jessup.

The new proposal put forward by the Soviet Union on March 28 to facilitate an agreement on the agenda opened the way for a unanimous decision. However, the representatives of the three Western powers have been trying to avoid expressing a clear and precise attitude towards the specific Soviet proposals.

The Soviet representative, Gromyko, pointed out in his speech that in order to reach an agreement on the agenda, the Soviet Union has suggested including the issue of eliminating German militarism as part of an agenda item on studying the causes of the existing international tensions in Europe, and linking the issue of reducing the four countries' troops and the related level of armaments to the same agenda for consideration. Therefore, the opposition of the three Western powers can no longer stand.

Gromyko then refuted the absurdity of the opinions of the three powers' representatives, who tried to portray the issue of the level of armaments as a "major issue." Gromyko pointed out that the purpose of the three Western powers' proposal is to enable the three countries to freely carry out a more intense arms expansion movement and take further measures to re-militarize West Germany.

Gromyko also criticized Jessup's speech. He pointed out that the three powers' request to include the issue of peace treaties with Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary on the agenda only complicates the agenda negotiations. However, since the three powers continue to insist on their proposal, the Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to put forward the following suggestion: "The peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, including the clauses on human rights, military clauses, and clauses on dispute resolution in these treaties; the four-power agreements on Germany and Austria, including the issues of eliminating Nazis, democratization, and war criminals, etc."

Gromyko also suggested adding a new item to the agenda: "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the issue of the United States establishing military bases in Britain, Norway, Iceland, and other countries in Europe and the Near East." He explained that because the issue is about improving relations between the Soviet Union and European countries, there are no convincing arguments against this suggestion, because this suggestion raises issues that are directly related to improving relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries.

The meeting of the four foreign ministers' assistants, originally scheduled for March 31, has been cancelled. The next meeting is scheduled for April 2.

　　四国外长助理会议继续举行        
    苏联再度提出新议程   
    主张将美国建立军事基地问题列入
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：苏、美、英、法四国外长助理于三月三十日举行第二十次会议，由美国代表耶塞普任主席。
    苏联在三月二十八日为了便于就议程取得协议而提出的新建议，打开了获得一致协议的决定的道路。但西方三国代表竭力避免对苏联的具体建议表示明白确切的态度。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯在发言中指出：为了获致关于议程的协议，苏联已建议把肃清德国军国主义的问题，作为关于研究欧洲现存国际紧张局势的原因一项议程的一部分，并把裁减四国军队的问题和与此有关的军备水平问题列入同一议程联系起来审议。因此，西方三国代表的反对就再也不能成立了。
    葛罗米柯继而驳斥三国代表的意见的荒谬，他们力图把军备水平问题说成是“主要问题”。葛罗米柯指出：西方三国的建议的目的，是要使三国能够放手地进行更紧张的扩张军备运动，并对西德重新军国主义化采取更进一步的措施。
    葛罗米柯又批评耶塞普的发言。他指出，三国要求把对保、罗、匈的和约问题列入议程只是使议程的谈判复杂化。但是，既然三国继续坚持它们的建议，苏联代表团就认为必须提出下列建议：“对意、罗、保、匈各国的和约，包括这些和约中关于人权的条款、军事条款以及关于解决争端的条款；四国关于德、奥两国的协定，包括肃清纳粹、民主化以及战争罪犯等问题”。
    葛罗米柯并建议在议程中再列入一个新的项目：“北大西洋公约及美国在英国、挪威、冰岛和欧洲以及近东其他国家建立军事基地的问题”。他解释说，因为问题在于改善苏联与欧洲各国之间的关系，所以，没有任何令人信服的论据可以反对这项建议，因为这项建议提出了对改进苏联与西方国家之间的关系有直接联系的问题。
    四国外长助理会议原定三月三十一日举行的会议已取消。下次会议定于四月二日举行。
