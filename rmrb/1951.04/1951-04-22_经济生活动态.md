           First Coal Mine Production Exhibition to Open Soon
    The first "Coal Mine Production Exhibition" in New China will open on the 24th of this month at the Beijing Labor People's Cultural Palace. This event is sponsored by the Second National Coal Mine Conference of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government. The exhibition is divided into five sections: comprehensive, coal mining, safety, workers' labor and life, and mining equipment and materials, including hundreds of specimens, models, pictures, and photographs. The exhibition provides detailed information on the distribution, history, and current situation of China's coal mining industry, the lives of coal miners since liberation, and advanced producers and their inventions. The exhibition is scheduled to last for nineteen days.
  Beijing Tram and Bus Fare Adjustment
    The Beijing Tram Company and the Bus Company have adjusted their fares starting from the 20th of this month. This is because the equipment used by trams and buses has increased in price several times. At the same time, starting from October last year, the Beijing People's Representative Conference resolved to levy a public utility surcharge to fund local primary schools and sanitation expenses, and the municipal government stipulated that trams and buses should be charged 8%. This surcharge should have been added to the fares, but at the time, the two companies did not increase fares to avoid increasing the burden on citizens, and only spent from the company's original income. Therefore, in 1950, although all employees of the two companies worked hard to reduce costs, the two companies still had a large loss in total. Therefore, with the approval of the Municipal Finance and Economic Committee, the two companies decided that starting from the 20th of this month, tram fares will increase by 100 yuan per ticket. Bus fares are calculated in segments of three stops each, with the first segment costing 300 yuan and each additional segment costing 200 yuan.

           首届煤矿生产展览会即将揭幕
    新中国第一次“煤矿生产展览会”，将于本月二十四日在北京市劳动人民文化宫开幕。该会系由中央人民政府燃料工业部第二次全国煤矿会议所主办。展览会内容共分综合、采煤、保安、职工劳动与生活、矿器用材等五部，包括各种标本、模型和图画、照片等数百幅。展览会对中国煤矿工业的分布、历史和现状，解放后煤矿工人们的生活与先进生产者及其创造发明等，均有详细介绍。展览会期预订为十九天。
  北京市电车公共汽车票价调整
    北京市电车公司和公共汽车公司，自本月二十日起调整票价。这是因为电车汽车所用的器材，有一部分已经涨价好几倍。同时，从去年十月起，北京市各界人民代表会议决议，征收公用事业附加税，以充地方小学及清洁卫生费，并经市政府规定，电车、汽车征收百分之八。这个附加税本来应该加到票价上，但当时两公司为了不增加市民的负担，没有增加票价，只在公司的原收入里支出。所以一九五○年里，虽然两个公司的全体职工，努力减低成本，但是两个公司合计起来，仍然有较大的亏损。因此，经请示市财政经济委员会批准后，两个公司决定：自本月二十日起，电车票每张增加一百元。汽车票每三站算一段，第一段三百元，每增加一段增加二百元。
