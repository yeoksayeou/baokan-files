　　Establishing Worker Consumer Cooperatives Based on Residential Areas
　  ——A Record of the Establishment of the Wuhan Ballpark District Worker Consumer Cooperative
　　Hu Youmeng, Gao Fengtong
    Organizing consumer cooperatives according to the residential areas of workers and their families is a new approach to building urban worker consumer cooperatives. The Wuhan Ballpark District Worker Consumer Cooperative was formed by merging five worker consumer cooperatives based on this approach.

  I. The Situation of Each Cooperative Before the Merger
    After the liberation of Wuhan in 1949, many worker consumer cooperatives were organized according to the trade union system. Although these cooperatives played a certain role in reducing intermediate exploitation and supplying members with daily necessities, they also had some serious shortcomings.
    The Ballpark District is the most concentrated area of worker residences in Wuhan. Most of the members of the five cooperatives (whose original addresses were not in the Ballpark District) that were reorganized and merged this time also lived in this area, but there was no worker consumer cooperative in this area in the past.
    The following is a summary of the five cooperatives that were reorganized and merged:

    Cooperative Name       Members        Funds (10,000 Yuan)       Average Daily Sales (10,000 Yuan)       Cadres       Monthly Salary (10,000 Yuan)       Total (10,000 Yuan)
    Construction Panel Truck Third Station Worker Consumer Cooperative       599        10,009        70        3        135
    Cotton Industry Worker Consumer Cooperative       623        423        30        3        120
    Human-Powered Tricycle Fourth Branch First Worker Consumer Cooperative       1,320        580        80        3        74.4
    Wharf Eleventh Branch First Worker Consumer Cooperative       642        1,438        130        4        180
    Yangtze River District Wharf Second Consumer Cooperative       2,053        4,870        200        7        235.5
    Total       5,237        8,320        510        20        744.9

    From the table above, the following problems can be seen:
    First, overlapping institutions, dispersed forces, and waste of human and material resources: For example, each cooperative has very few members and funds, and the turnover is also very small. However, each cooperative must have its own premises, a set of business equipment, and a minimum number of cadres, resulting in a great waste. Taking cadre salaries as an example, they account for an average of 5% of sales. Therefore, the Construction Panel Truck Third Station Worker Consumer Cooperative (hereinafter referred to as the Panel Truck Third Station Cooperative), the Cotton Industry Worker Consumer Cooperative (hereinafter referred to as the Cotton Industry Worker Cooperative), and the Wharf Eleventh Branch First Worker Consumer Cooperative (hereinafter referred to as the Eleventh Branch Cooperative) had to adopt the method of deducting a certain amount of wages from their members every day (i.e., the "dividing accounts" method) to pay for the expenses of the cooperative cadres.
    Second, the location of the cooperatives is not suitable, and it is inconvenient for members to purchase goods: Most of the members of the five cooperatives live in the Ballpark District, but the addresses of the cooperatives are set up according to the trade union and administrative institutions. In this way, two-thirds of the members of the Yangtze River District Wharf Second Consumer Cooperative (hereinafter referred to as the Yangtze River Second Cooperative) live far away from the cooperative, the Panel Truck Third Station Cooperative is located on the Jiangbian Sanbei Wharf, which is four or five li away from the Ballpark District, and the address of the Cotton Industry Worker Cooperative is more than one li away from the workers' residences, so most of the members do not buy goods from the cooperative.
    Third, there are too many cooperatives, which makes it inconvenient for the city's cooperative headquarters to lead: Most grassroots cooperative cadres neglect democratic management. Except for the Yangtze River Second Cooperative, none of the others have democratic organizations, and various systems are even more unsound. Even individual cooperatives are controlled by bad cadres. For example, Du Ruian, the manager of the Human-Powered Tricycle Fourth Branch First Worker Consumer Cooperative (hereinafter referred to as the Fourth Branch First Cooperative), embezzled more than 6,000 jin of loaned grain and more than 2 million yuan in cash. It took several months before he was sent to the court for handling through the members' congress.
    In order to consolidate the cooperatives, promote rational management, and better meet the needs of the members, the city's cooperative headquarters decided to merge these five cooperatives and reorganize them into a consumer cooperative organized according to the workers' residential area. The city's cooperative headquarters sent a working group in early February to lead the preparatory work for the merger.

  II. The Process of Preparing for the Merger
    The first obstacle to the merger and reorganization was the difference in understanding of this issue among cooperative cadres, members, and relevant parties. To this end, the working group first mobilized them in a step-by-step manner. At that time, the situation of each cooperative was: the Eleventh Branch Cooperative and the Cotton Industry Worker Cooperative were small, had little business, and their organizations were unsound, so the cadres agreed to the merger. The Fourth Branch First Cooperative had many members and was initially unwilling to merge, but the funds were too small and the business could not be developed, which could not meet the needs of the members. After mobilization, the cadres' thinking was cleared. Even within a cooperative, the cadres' thinking was not consistent. Cadres paid by the cooperative wanted to leave the cooperative because their treatment was low and they thought they could earn more money by working at the wharf, so they agreed to the merger. Cadres who were "dividing accounts" at the wharf and those with poor physical strength were afraid of being laid off and did not agree to the merger. They agreed only after persuasion.
    Members, trade unions, and administrative departments also initially disagreed with the merger. The working group held members' congresses separately and discussed with trade unions and administrative departments several times to study the correct relationship between cooperatives, trade unions, and administrative departments, explaining that the merger could save expenses, manage rationally, and better meet the needs of members. Finally, all parties agreed to the merger, and the preparatory work could proceed smoothly. The managers of the five cooperatives and two representatives of each cooperative's team leader formed a preparatory committee. The preparatory committee selected an appropriate address for the cooperative (this is very important, such as the Yangtze River Second Cooperative, which was originally formed by the merger of the Sixth and Seventh Branches, but it could not develop well only because the address was not suitable), elected members' representatives and the board of directors and supervisors, repaired the houses, and sorted out and handed over property. The following major issues were also resolved in the preparatory work:
    1. Placement of surplus cadres from the old cooperatives: In the past, most of the cadres of each cooperative were produced by the trade union, and even still "divided accounts" among the workers, and most of them retained their right to work. Before the merger, the working group separately obtained the consent of the trade union administration that, except for individuals who voluntarily and were democratically assessed to stay in the new cooperative, all the rest would return to their original work posts to work.
    2. Balancing of share capital and public accumulation fund: In the past, each of the five cooperatives generally had one share per person (some people in the Yangtze River Second Cooperative had several shares), but the amount of each share was different, and some had already lost money, so it was necessary to balance them through democratic discussion. The new cooperative stipulates that the amount of each share is ten jin of second-class rice. The original amount of small shares had to be made up. For example, the Fourth Branch First Cooperative had 2.5 jin of second-class rice per share and lost half a jin, so the members of the cooperative made up 5.5 jin this time. In addition, the public accumulation fund of the Yangtze River Second Cooperative was more than that of other cooperatives, and the members proposed that they did not want to merge the public accumulation fund into the new cooperative. After the comrades of the working group explained that the nature of the public accumulation fund was for the long-term construction of the cooperative, there was no objection.
    3. Transfer of some members to other cooperatives: After the merger, more than 80% of the members were close to the cooperative and it was convenient for them to buy goods, but a small number of members were farther away from the cooperative than before. In order to facilitate members' purchases, they were transferred to nearby cooperatives on a voluntary basis.
    4. Business suspension and opening time: During the preparatory period of the new cooperative, in order to avoid members not being able to buy goods, the business suspension time of each cooperative was arranged in order, and at the same time, the method of mutual use of purchase certificates of the five cooperatives was adopted. When Cooperative A suspended business and handed over, its members could buy goods at Cooperative B. When all five cooperatives suspended business, the new cooperative had been prepared and opened for business the next day.

  III. The Benefits of the Merger and Reorganization
    The merger and reorganization clearly have the following benefits. First of all, it is more convenient for members to buy goods. In the past, many members lived four or five li away from the cooperative, but now the farthest is only one and a half li away. In the past, members joined the cooperative according to the trade union system, and could not join the cooperative nearby. Now, whichever cooperative is closer, they can join that cooperative.
    Secondly, the funds are concentrated, there are more goods, and the turnover has also expanded. In the past, the most funds were no more than 48 million yuan, and the least was only more than 4 million yuan. After the merger, there are more than 83 million yuan. In the past, there were very few goods. The Fourth Branch First Cooperative only had 12 kinds, and the Yangtze River Second Cooperative had the most, but it was only 82 kinds. Now there are as many as 182 kinds of goods. Due to the faster turnover, the storage volume of goods has also been reduced. For example, in the past, each cooperative often stored 200 jin of edible salt in order to ensure supply, but now 500 jin is enough. The reduction in the reasonable storage volume of goods has greatly saved funds. Due to the convenience of members buying goods and the increase in the types of goods, the turnover has also expanded. In the past, the total sales of the five cooperatives averaged 5.1 million yuan per day, but after the merger, it increased to more than 7.9 million yuan.
    Thirdly, it has saved cadres and reduced expenses: In the past, the five cooperatives had a total of 20 cadres, and the total monthly salary expenditure was 7.4 million yuan. After the merger, there are 12 cadres and one cook, and the monthly salary does not exceed 3.9 million yuan. In the past, there were 20 electric lights in the five cooperatives, but now only 12 are needed. The equipment for selling goods was incomplete in the past, but after the merger, there is still a surplus of equipment. At the same time, after the small cooperatives were merged into large cooperatives, the division of labor was implemented, and the business skills gradually improved. In the past, three cooperatives did not know how to do modern bookkeeping, and some accounts were unclear. After the merger, an accounting supervisor was hired to establish modern bookkeeping and daily report systems, eliminating the past chaos. Other systems such as learning, life, and work have also begun to be established. In addition, it has also solved the difficulty of holding meetings due to the scattered residence of members and is more convenient for the city's cooperative headquarters to conduct in-depth leadership.
    At present, the work within the cooperative has not yet fully returned to normal due to the recent merger. For example, some of the old cooperative accounts have not yet been cleared, and the pricing of individual goods lacks cost accounting, etc. However, this experiment proves that it is necessary and feasible to organize worker consumer cooperatives of various industries living scattered in cities according to regions.

　　按住区成立工人消费合作社
　  ——记武汉市球场区工人消费合作社成立经过
　　胡友孟　高凤桐
    按照各业工人及其家属居住的区域组织消费合作社，是建设城市职工消费合作社工作的一个新作法。武汉市球场区工人消费合作社就是根据这个作法，由五个工人消费合作社合并组成的。
  一、合并前各社的情况
    一九四九年武汉解放后，曾先后按照工会系统组织了许多工人消费合作社。这些社在减除中间剥削，供给社员日用品上，虽然起过一定作用，但也存在着若干严重缺点。
    球场区是武汉市工人居住最集中的地区，这次被改组合并的五个社（原来社址都不在球场区），大部社员也都是住在这个区域，但是在这个区域过去却没有一个工人消费合作社。
    下面是这次被改组合并的五个社改组以前的概况：社名  社员   
     资金（万元）    平均每天销货额（万元）     干部   每月工薪
      （万元）  总额（万元）建筑板车第三站工人消费社      五九九     一、○○九    七○        三      一三五棉花业工人消费社          六二三         四二三    三○      
  三      一二○人力三轮车四支会第一工人消费社  一、三二○   
  五八○    八○        三      七四·四码头第十一分会第一工人消费社  六四二     一、四三八    一三○      四      一八○长江区码头工人第二消费社      二、○五三 四、八七○    二○○  
    七      二三五·五共计  五、二三七 八、三二○    五一○  
    二○    七四四·九
    从上表可以看出以下几个问题：
    第一、机构重复，力量分散，浪费人力物力：如每个合作社的社员和资金都很少，同时营业额也很小，但每社必须各有一处房舍，一套营业用具和最低数量的干部，因而形成很大的浪费。以干部薪金来说，平均即占销货额百分之五。因此建筑板车第三站工人消费社（以下简称板车三站社）、棉花业工人消费社（以下简称棉业工人社）、码头第十一分会第一工人消费社（以下简称十一分会社）三社，不得不采用由社员逐日分出工资若干（即“分账”办法），来支付合作社干部的开支。
    第二、社址不适中，社员购买物品不方便：五个合作社绝大部分社员住在球场区，但社址是按工会和行政机构设置的。这样，长江区码头工人第二消费合作社（以下简称长江二社），有三分之二的社员离社很远，板车三站社在离球场四、五里路远的江边三北码头，棉业工人社的社址和工人的住处相隔一里多路，所以大部分社员都不到社里买货。
    第三、社数多，市合作总社领导不便：大部基层社干部，忽视民主管理，除长江二社外，其余都没有民主组织，各种制度更不健全。甚至个别社被坏干部所把持，如人力三轮车四支会第一工人消费合作社（以下简称四支一社）经理杜瑞庵，贪污贷粮六千多斤，现款二百多万元，隔了几个月，才通过社员大会，送法院处理。
    该市合作总社为化零为整，促使经营合理化，便决定将这五个社合并，改组成按工人住区组织的一个消费合作社。市合作总社于二月初派工作组领导筹备合并工作。
  二、筹备合并的经过
    合并改组工作的第一个障碍，就是合作社干部、社员和有关方面对此问题认识上的分歧。工作组为此首先有步骤地向他们进行动员。当时各社的情况是：十一分会社和棉业工人社是社小、业务少，组织不健全，干部们同意合并。四支一社社员多，开始不愿合并，但资金太少，业务展不开，满足不了社员需要，经动员后，才打通干部的思想。就是一个社内的干部，思想也不一致，由社内支薪的干部，因待遇低，认为到码头劳动可以多挣钱，所以想离社，同意合并；在码头“分账”和体力差的干部，怕被裁，不同意合并，经过说服才同意。
    社员、工会和行政，开始也不同意合并。工作组分别召开了社员大会，又和工会、行政几次商讨，研究了合作社与工会、行政的正确关系，说明合并后可以节省开支，合理经营，更好地满足社员需要。最后，各方面都同意合并，筹备工作才得顺利地进行。五社经理，及每社小组长代表二人组织了筹备委员会。筹委会选择了适当的社址（这是很重要的，如长江二社，本来由六七分会两社合并组成，只因社址不适当，不能很好发展），进行了社员代表及理监事会选举，修整房屋，清理、交接财物等工作。在筹备工作中并解决了下列几项主要问题：
    一、旧社多余干部的安置：原来各社干部多从工会产生，甚至仍在工人中“分账”，并大部保留工作权。在合并前，工作组分别商得工会行政的同意，除个人自愿并经民主评定留新社工作外，其余一律回原岗位劳动。
    二、平衡股金与公积金的处理：原来五社一般都是一人一股（长江二社有一人数股的），但每股金额不同，还有的已经赔了钱，因此必须通过民主讨论，加以平衡。新社规定每股金额为二机米十斤。原来金额小的要补上。如四支一社每股二机米五斤，又亏损了半斤，该社社员这次就补交了五斤半。又长江二社的公积金比别社多，社员提出不愿将公积金合并到新社。经工作组同志说明公积金是为了长期建设合作社的性质后，也就没有异议了。
    三、部分社员转社问题：合并后，百分之八十以上的社员离社近买货便利了，但也有一小部分社员比以前离社远了，为便利社员购买，根据自愿，转到附近的合作社。
    四、停业与开业时间：在新社筹备期内，为避免社员买不到货，将各社停业时间先后排列，同时采用了五社购买证互相通用的办法，甲社停业交接时，它的社员可到乙社买货。等五社都停业时，新社已筹备妥当，次日就开业了。
  三、合并改组的好处
    合并改组后明显地有下列几点好处。首先是社员买货方便了，以前许多社员离社四、五里路，现在最远的只一里半路。以前社员按工会系统入社，近处有社不能加入，现在那个社近，就加入那个社。
    其次是资金集中，货样多了，营业额也扩大了。以前资金最多的不过四千八百万元，最少的只有四百多万元，合并后就有八千三百多万元。从前货样很少，四支一社只有十二种，长江二社最多，但也不过八二种，现在货样多到一八二种。由于流转快了，商品的储存量也减少了，比如以前每社经常备存食盐二百斤，才能保证供应，现在只要有五百斤就足够了。商品合理储存量的减少，大大地节省了资金。由于社员买货便利和商品种类的增多，营业额也扩大了。以前五社销货总额平均每日五一○万元，合并后增加到七百九十多万元。
    第三是节省了干部，减少了开支：以前五个社干部共二十人，每月共开支薪金七百四十万元。合并后用干部十二人，炊事员一人，每月工薪不超过三百九十万元。原来五社电灯二十盏，现在只要十二盏。原来卖货的用具不全，合并后用具还有余裕。同时在小社并成大社后，实行了业务分工，业务技术随之渐渐提高。从前有三社不会新式簿记，有的账目不清；合并后聘主管会计一人，建立了新式簿记和日报表等制度，消除了过去的混乱现象。其他如学习、生活、工作等制度也都开始建立。此外还解决了因社员居住分散不便召开会议的困难和更便于市合作总社的深入领导。
    目前社内工作，因合并不久，还未完全走上正轨。如旧社账款有的还没交清，个别货品定价缺乏成本核算等等。但是通过这一实验证明在城市中按照区域，组织分散居住的各业工人消费合作社是必要而且可行的。
