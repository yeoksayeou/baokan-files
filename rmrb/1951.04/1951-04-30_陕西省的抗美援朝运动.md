The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Shaanxi Province unfolded at the end of October and beginning of November last year, on the basis of the more than six million people (approximately half of the province's population) who signed the "Stockholm Appeal" to defend world peace and oppose American aggression. The movement began in cities, government offices, schools, factories, and some rural areas near cities. After late December, it spread widely to rural areas. By the end of January and beginning of February this year, it had spread to all towns and villages. After celebrating the liberation of Pyongyang and Seoul, winter studies, the Spring Festival, the February demonstration against American rearmament of Japan, and the post-March 8th movement, it had spread to most rural areas. The movement had also affected most of the very few rural areas (such as remote villages in mountainous areas of northern and southern Shaanxi) that had not been reached in the past.

The scale of this movement is very large. In addition to combining propaganda with current central tasks such as land reform, rent reduction, anti-despotism, grain requisition, winter studies, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the banning of the Yiguandao sect, the movement against American cultural aggression, the patriotic self-governance and renovation movement in religious circles, the movement of students participating in military cadre schools, the celebration of the liberation of Pyongyang and Seoul, opposition to American rearmament of Japan, and the March 8th movement all focused on resisting America and aiding Korea. Demonstrations and parades were held in all 97 counties and cities in the province, as well as in most market towns and along railway lines. According to a survey in the Xianyang District, approximately one-third of the rural population went to the cities to participate in patriotic movements. In Nanzheng City, the demonstration against American rearmament of Japan lasted for seven or eight days, with over 13,000 urban and rural residents participating each day. Over 10,000 women participated in the March 8th parade. In Hua County, the celebration of the liberation of Pyongyang and Seoul alone was attended by over 40,000 people, approximately one-quarter of the county's population. In the Sanqiao District of Chang'an County, over 30,000 people participated in the demonstration against American rearmament of Japan, accounting for 80% of the district's population. Yangko dances were very common during the Spring Festival. In Suide County in northern Shaanxi alone, there were 198 Yangko teams with over 4,960 performers and over 100,000 spectators, accounting for two-thirds of the county's population. In the Guanzhong region, every township and even every administrative village had a Yangko team. The content of the performances mainly focused on resisting America and aiding Korea, production, and land reform. More than ten provincial cultural troupes and middle and primary schools organized propaganda teams during the winter vacation to go deep into the countryside to conduct propaganda. The Provincial Cultural Troupe alone performed in six counties, including Baoji, Fufeng, Qishan, Fengxiang, Wugong, and Tongguan, from November last year to early January this year, with an audience of approximately 350,000 people. In late November last year, Xixiang County organized over 1,000 young students into nine teams to go deep into the countryside, performing 120 plays, posting 326 wall newspapers, 280 picture posters and maps, writing over 400 slogans, and publishing 58 blackboard newspapers, educating approximately 85,000 people. Many folk artists also participated in this propaganda activity. For example, Xue Maogong, a folk artist from Jingyang, with the help of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, has been performing kuaiban everywhere since November last year, with an audience of over 50,000 people. Last year, approximately 700,000 students participated in winter studies in the province. Twenty-five percent of the winter studies materials were related to resisting America and aiding Korea, and some were entirely based on newspapers, with even more materials related to resisting America and aiding Korea. This was a systematic and relatively in-depth education. After the end of winter studies, over 200,000 people transferred to people's schools, and the rest transferred to newspaper reading groups. There were 171 newspaper reading groups in Suide County around the Spring Festival. There are already over 600 newspaper reading groups in Hua County. By the end of March, 264 newspaper reading groups had been established in the Sanqiao District of Chang'an, with 2,597 participants and 332 subscriptions to various newspapers. According to reports from various regions, it is estimated that approximately 4,000 newspaper reading groups have been established throughout the province. Each group has as few as seven or eight people and as many as sixty or seventy people. These people can regularly receive policy and current affairs education, and have a significant impact on other people. In order to provide propaganda materials, in addition to the propaganda materials printed and distributed by various districts and counties, the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department, the Provincial Department of Culture and Education, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Youth League, the Trade Union, the Women's Federation, and other organizations issued over 40 types of propaganda materials, totaling over 150,000 copies. These propaganda materials played a significant role in guiding and promoting the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. Rural blackboard newspapers are also relatively common. According to statistics from six districts in Jingyang County, there are 360 of them. According to statistics from 51 townships in Liquan County, the original 83 blackboard newspapers increased to 523 after the launch of the land reform and Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. These are newspapers run by the peasant masses themselves, and they have played a certain role in publicizing Resist America, Aid Korea and promoting current work. Temple fairs were extremely common in the winter and spring seasons. For example, the "Laba Festival Fair" in Sanyuan, the "February Fair" in Jingyang, the "Winter Fair" in Gaoling, and the "New Year Fair" in Liquan lasted for up to half a month, with over 10,000 participants each day. Each county organized a propaganda committee to carry out planned propaganda, which achieved considerable results.

The greatest achievement of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement was raising the national self-confidence and self-esteem of the people of all classes, enhancing political awareness, and quelling the rumors of counter-revolutionary elements. At the beginning of the Korean War, rumors were rife in the new and some old liberated areas, and people of all classes, including some cadres, had many ideological concerns and "unsolvable" problems. The situation was completely the opposite in the old liberated areas of northern Shaanxi. Some people in Yan'an questioned the government: "Korea and China are neighbors. Why don't we send troops to help them when the United States invades them?!" Some said: "The invasion of northern Shaanxi by Hu Zongnan's bandit troops in 1947 was the idea of the United States. Now they are invading Korea again. The American devils are really our eternal enemies. We can't let our descendants forget! We can't live in peace until we destroy them." After our volunteer army went abroad to fight, the people of Yan'an immediately expressed their support. After the liberation of Pyongyang and Seoul, the ideological concerns of the people of all classes were basically dispelled, and some vague understandings were also clarified. According to recent random checks and surveys in various regions, the rural masses generally know that American imperialism is the enemy of the Chinese people, and the Soviet Union is the friend of the Chinese people. If the masses want to live in peace, they must defeat the American aggressors. They also understand that resisting America and aiding Korea is not only a matter for the army, but also a task for the entire people. They have full confidence in defeating the American aggressors. This understanding is becoming increasingly consolidated. Recently, counter-revolutionary rumors have basically been quelled. After the Chinese and Korean People's Army took the initiative to withdraw from Seoul, no rumors were heard. The masses generally responded: "This is the old tactic of the People's Liberation Army. Withdrawing from Seoul is to eliminate the enemy's manpower."

Based on the above understanding and under the slogan of "Resisting America and Aiding Korea with Practical Actions," people of all classes have shown a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm. Factories, schools, and the business community have generally formulated patriotic covenants, and rural people in some areas have formulated patriotic covenants or production plans. All factories have launched patriotic production competitions. Production efficiency has increased unprecedentedly. For example, the production quality of the B-shift spinning workshop of the Shenxin Cotton Mill in Baoji increased to 60%. The peasant masses showed unprecedented enthusiasm in handing over public grain last winter. 479 households in Shangnan County that were not burdened with grain also demanded to hand over grain to resist America and aid Korea. When delivering public grain, many places beat drums and gongs, and some places composed many songs such as "Public grain is sent to the volunteer army, eat and dress warmly to defeat the American devils, and protect our good life." "Mulberry wood carrying pole and bamboo basket, carrying public grain happily, supporting Korea to drive away the American wolves." "Korea and we are neighbors, American invasion of Korea is like invading us, supporting Korea is protecting our home." In the early stages of land reform, some people were still afraid of "changing the sky" and did not dare to tear up their faces and fight against landlords. After propaganda, they generally dispelled their concerns and organized militia to patrol day and night to monitor illegal landlords. In January of this year, Wangjiaping and Haojiaqiao, model villages in northern Shaanxi, took the lead in formulating a patriotic production plan for resisting America and aiding Korea and challenged the farmers of the entire province. Farmers in many places immediately formulated plans to respond to the challenge, and production enthusiasm was generally high. For example, some districts in Chang'an County finished weeding wheat by the end of March. Mutual aid and labor exchange organizations are also very common. One-third of middle school students have signed up to participate in military cadre schools. Some are afraid that they will not pass the physical examination, so they deliberately wear thick clothes to increase their weight. Some firmly demand to go to Korea immediately to fight against the American aggressors. Students in school have very high learning enthusiasm. During the winter vacation, many students went deep into the countryside to publicize the establishment of newspaper reading groups, organize and lead Yangko teams, etc., and played a significant role in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. The most prominent performance of the business community is the active and timely payment of business tax. Their patriotic covenants all unanimously stated: "Obey the economic policies of the people's government, oppose speculation and profiteering, and strive to exchange materials between urban and rural areas," and "Do not sell American goods," etc. Patriotic believers in religious circles also said, "We will not lag behind in loving the country and opposing imperialism." The Catholic churches in Yan'an, Yulin, Zhouzhi, and Nanzheng successively issued declarations and statements on self-governance and renovation, severing relations with imperialism, and striving to build a new China. Since the end of February, more than 4,000 Christians in Xi'an, Weibei, and northern Shaanxi have signed in support of the self-governance and renovation movement. People of all classes showed great enthusiasm in the donation movement. According to a survey in Huizhi Village, Wen'an District, Xingping County, among 197 households with 984 people, 80 women made comfort bags and socks, and 171 people donated money. According to incomplete statistics from Heyang and Dali counties two months ago, women alone donated more than 1,500 towels. Farmer Yang Zhiguang donated two silver ingots left by his ancestors to help Korean refugees.

The experience of this period proves that in order to make the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement popular and in-depth, the party committees at all levels must first personally take action and grasp the leadership firmly. Where the leadership grasps tightly, the movement is carried out in depth. As far as the province as a whole is concerned, before the Provincial Party Committee's instructions in February, the leadership of some counties had not given enough attention to it, and the movement had a phenomenon of being tight in some places and loose in others, intermittent. After the Provincial Party Committee's instructions, the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement has attracted the attention of the entire party, and the party committees at all levels have specially conducted discussions and arrangements, making the movement a big step forward. Before and after the start of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, cadres and schools above the middle school level throughout the province concentrated their efforts on studying current affairs, correcting and clarifying everyone's understanding of the current situation. This was a major ideological mobilization, which laid a good foundation for carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. Secondly, the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement must be closely combined with the current central tasks. The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in the Guanzhong area is relatively common, precisely because the movement is first combined with the anti-feudal struggle. Third, in propaganda, the methods should be diverse and vivid. Experience has proved that picture exhibitions, cartoons, kuaiban, songs, small living newspapers, and crosstalk are the most popular with the masses and are also easily accepted by the masses.

　　陕西省的抗美援朝运动
    本报特约记者　延泽民
    陕西省抗美援朝运动，是在去年十月底至十一月初，保卫世界和平，反对美国侵略，六百余万人民（约占全省人口二分之一）在“斯德哥尔摩宣言”上签名的基础上展开的。运动由城市、机关、学校、工厂及城市近郊部分农村开始。十二月下旬以后，即向农村广泛发展。到今年一月底二月初，已普及到所有城镇和农村。经过庆祝平壤汉城光复、冬学、春节，二月间反对美国武装日本示威，“三八”节以后，已普及到绝大部分农村。极少数过去运动尚未波及到的农村（如陕北、陕南某些山区中的偏僻村庄）也大部受到了运动的影响。
    这个运动的规模是很大的。除了结合当前各项中心任务如土地改革、减租、反恶霸、征粮、冬学、镇压反革命、取缔一贯道等进行宣传外，反对美国文化侵略运动、宗教界的爱国自立革新运动、学生参加军事干部学校运动、庆祝平壤汉城光复、反对美国武装日本、和“三八”节运动，都是以抗美援朝为内容。全省九十七个县、市及大部分集镇与铁路沿线，都举行了示威游行。据咸阳分区调查，农村群众到城市参加爱国运动的约达总农村人口三分之一以上。南郑市的反对美国武装日本示威游行持续了七、八天，每天都有城乡群众一万三千余人参加。在“三八”节妇女群众参加游行者达一万余人。华县仅庆祝平壤、汉城光复大会，参加人数即达四万余人，占全县人口四分之一左右。长安县三桥区举行反对美国武装日本示威游行时，参加人数三万余人，占全区人口百分之八十。春节时秧歌活动甚为普遍。仅陕北绥德一县，就有一百九十八个秧歌队，演员四千九百六十多人，观众达十万以上，占全县人口三分之二。关中区每个乡以至每个行政村都有一个秧歌队。宣传内容主要是抗美援朝、生产、土地改革等。全省十余个文工团及中、小学校在寒假中组织宣传队，深入农村进行宣传。仅省文工团自去年十一月至今年一月初，就先后在宝鸡、扶风、岐山、凤翔、武功、潼关六个县演唱，观众、听众约三十五万人。西乡县于去年十一月下旬，组织了一千多青年学生分九个队深入农村，演戏一百二十场，贴出墙报三百二十六版，画报地图二百八十多幅，写标语四百多条，出黑板报五十八次，受教育群众约八万五千多人。许多民间艺人亦参加了这一宣传活动。如泾阳民间艺人薛茂公在文联帮助下，自去年十一月起到处演唱快板，听众达五万余人。去年全省参加冬学学生约七十余万人，冬学教材百分之二十五为抗美援朝，有的完全以报纸为教材，有关抗美援朝的材料更多。这是一次系统的比较深入的教育。冬学结束以后，有二十余万人转入民校，其余一部分转入读报组。绥德县在春节前后，有一百七十一个读报组。华县读报组已达六百余个。长安三桥一个区截止三月底已建立起二百六十四个读报组，参加读报的有两千五百九十七人，订立各种报纸三百三十二份。根据各地报告估计全省已建立读报组四千左右。每组人数少至七、八人，多则六、七十人。这些群众都能够经常受到政策和时事教育，对其他群众影响亦不小。为了供给宣传资料，除了各分区、县印发之宣传品外，仅省委宣传部、省文教厅、文联、青、工、妇等团体即发宣传品四十余种，约十五万多份。这些宣传品对指导与推动抗美援朝运动作用很大。农村黑板报亦较普遍。据泾阳县六个区统计，即有三百六十块。醴泉县五十一个乡统计，原来有黑板报八十三块，土地改革和抗美援朝运动展开后，增加到五百二十三块。这是农民群众自己办的报纸，对宣传抗美援朝与推动当前工作，均起了一定的作用。冬春两季，各地庙会极为普遍。如三原的“腊八会”、泾阳的“二月会”、高陵的“冬季会”、醴泉的“正月会”等，历时达半个月之久，每日与会的都在万人以上。各该县均组织了宣传委员会，进行了有计划的宣传，收到相当效果。
    抗美援朝运动的最大收获，是提高了各阶层群众的民族自信心与自尊心，提高了政治觉悟，平息了反革命分子的谣言。朝鲜战争开始时，新区及部分老区谣言四起，各阶层人民群众以至部分干部，思想顾虑和“解不开”的问题很多。在陕北老解放区情况则完全相反，延安有些群众质问政府：“朝鲜和中国是邻家，美国侵略它，咱们为什么不出兵帮助？！”有的说：“一九四七年胡宗南匪军侵犯陕北是美国的主意，现在又侵略朝鲜，美国鬼子真是咱们的世仇，不能叫子孙们忘记！不把它消灭掉，咱就过不成安宁日子。”我志愿军出国作战后，延安群众马上表示拥护。平壤、汉城光复后，各阶层人民群众的思想顾虑基本上打消了，一些模糊认识也澄清了。据最近各地抽查测验结果，农村群众一般都知道了美国帝国主义是中国人民的敌人，苏联是中国人民的朋友。大众要过安宁日子，就要打败美国侵略者。也明白了抗美援朝不光是军队的事，也是全体人民的任务。对打败美国侵略者有了充分的信心。这种认识目前日趋巩固，最近反革命谣言基本平息，中朝人民军主动撤出汉城后，也未听到什么谣言。群众普遍反映是：“这是解放军的老战术，撤出汉城是为了消灭敌人的有生力量。”
    在上述认识的基础上和“以实际行动抗美援朝”的口号下，各阶层人民群众都表现了高度的爱国热忱。工厂、学校及工商界，一般都订立了爱国公约，部分地区的农村群众已订立了爱国公约或生产计划。各工厂都展开了爱国生产竞赛。生产效率空前提高。如宝鸡申新纱厂乙班摇纱车间，生产质量提高至百分之六十。农民群众在去冬交纳公粮中表现了从来未有的积极性，商南县四百七十九家不负担户，亦要求交纳抗美援朝粮。在送公粮时，许多地方都是敲锣打鼓，有的地方并编写了很多歌诗如“公粮送给志愿军，吃饱穿暖打败美国鬼子，保卫咱们好光景。”“桑木扁担竹筐筐，担上公粮喜洋洋，支援朝鲜赶走美国狼。”“朝鲜和咱是邻家，美国侵朝如侵咱，支援朝鲜就是保咱家。”土地改革初期，有些群众还害怕“变天”，不大敢向地主撕破面皮斗争，经过宣传后，一般都打消了顾虑，并组织民兵日夜巡逻监视不法地主。今年一月陕北模范村王家坪、郝家桥，带头订立抗美援朝爱国主义生产计划，并向全省农民挑战。许多地方的农民立即订计划应战，生产情绪普遍高涨。如长安有些区于三月底即将麦子锄完。变工互助组织亦很普遍，中学生有三分之一报名参加军事干部学校。有的恐怕检查身体的验不上，故意穿厚衣服增加体重，有的坚决要求马上就去朝鲜打美国侵略者。在校学生学习情绪很高。不少学生在寒假期间，深入农村宣传建立读报组，组织并领导秧歌队等，对抗美援朝运动所起作用甚大。工商界表现最突出的是积极按时缴纳营业税。他们的爱国公约上都不约而同地写着：“服从人民政府的经济政策，反对投机倒把，努力城乡物资交流。”和“不贩美国货”等。宗教界中的爱国教徒也表示“爱国反帝不落人后”。延安、榆林、盩厔、南郑天主教会先后发表了自立革新宣言、声明与帝国主义断绝关系，为建设新中国而奋斗。西安、渭北、陕北等地基督教徒自二月底起已有四千多人签名拥护自立革新运动。各阶层人民群众在捐献运动中表现得非常踊跃。据兴平县文安区惠址坊村调查，在一百九十七户人家九百八十四人中，有八十个妇女做了慰问袋与袜子，一百七十一人捐了钱。据郃阳、大荔两县两个月前不完全统计，仅妇女捐出毛巾即有一千五百余条。农民杨直光捐出他祖先遗留下的两个元宝救济朝鲜难民。
    这个时期的经验证明：要使抗美援朝运动普及深入，首先各级党委必须亲自动手，抓紧领导。那里领导上抓得紧，那里的运动就搞得深入。就全省来说，在二月省委指示以前，某些县的领导上，还未予以足够重视，运动有此紧彼松，时断时续的现象。省委指示以后，抗美援朝运动已引起全党的重视，各级党委都专门进行讨论布置，使运动大大地向前迈进了一步。在抗美援朝开始前后，全省干部和中等以上学校，都集中力量进行时事学习，端正与明确了大家对时局的认识。这是一次思想上的大动员，给开展抗美援朝运动打下了良好的基础。其次，抗美援朝运动必须和当前的中心任务密切结合。关中地区的抗美援朝运动比较普遍，正是由于运动首先是和反封建斗争相结合的。第三，在宣传中，方式要多，要生动。经验证明，图片展览、漫画、快板、歌词、小型活报、相声等最受群众欢迎，亦容易为群众接受。
