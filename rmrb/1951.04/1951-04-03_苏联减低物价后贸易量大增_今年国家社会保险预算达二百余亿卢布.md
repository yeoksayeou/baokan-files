　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 2nd: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on April 1st: Since the fourth price reduction in the Soviet Union on March 1st, the trade volume across the country has greatly increased over the past month. Communications from various parts of the Soviet Union indicate that people's demand for high-quality textiles, pianos, jewelry, motorcycles, and automobiles has increased sharply, not only in major cities but also in remote areas. For example, farmers in the Omsk region of Siberia recently purchased a total of approximately 5,000 radios, 3,000 sewing machines, 1,500 gramophones, 4,000 bicycles, and 900 motorcycles and automobiles. In the past, farmers mainly bought calico and imitation satin, but now they want to buy all kinds of silks, crepe, and woolen fabrics.
    The trade volume in Belarusian villages has increased by 20 percent. In the first half of March, collective farmers in Estonia bought 1 million rubles worth of goods more than in the first half of February, and the trade volume in rural areas doubled. Shops in Lithuania now sell 20 to 25 percent more sausages, candies, pastries, and other foods every day than in February.
    The trade network in various places has been greatly expanded. For example, 300 new stores have been opened in rural Belarus this year. Many department stores and specialty stores have also been newly opened in cities and villages in the Altai and Krasnoyarsk Territories and other regions of Siberia. More than 300 stores will be opened in the cities and villages of Estonia this year.

　　Xinhua News Agency, April 1st: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow: The Soviet Union's 1951 national social insurance budget has been approved, with a total budget of 21.1 billion rubles, an increase of 3 billion rubles compared to last year.
    Giktenko, Deputy Director of the National Social Insurance Fund Administration of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, wrote in the Labor Newspaper on March 30th: The Soviet Union's national social insurance budget has roughly doubled in the years since the war. This is due to the development of the Soviet national economy and the rise in national income. The working people in all sectors of the national economy enjoy social insurance benefits without exception. The state bears the costs of medical care, vacations, old-age insurance, and allowances when workers lose their ability to work. At the same time, due to the preventive and other measures taken by the government and trade unions, the incidence of illness and loss of working ability among the working people has been regularly decreasing year by year, while the conditions for rest and medical treatment are constantly improving. Last year, approximately 2.5 million people spent their holidays in sanatoriums and health facilities organized by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. This year, 1.27 billion rubles have been allocated for the expenses of sanatoriums and rest homes, an increase of 158 million rubles compared to last year. 235.5 million rubles have been allocated for the development of sanatorium and rest home buildings. 264.5 million rubles have been allocated for the development of cultural, educational, and sports facilities, as well as travel centers. 42 million rubles have been allocated for organizing specially nutritious food, an increase of 6 million rubles compared to last year. Regarding welfare services for women and children, maternity allowances for women have increased by 124 million rubles this year, totaling 1.495 billion rubles. This year, 2.65 million children will spend their summer vacation in Young Pioneer camps. The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions is organizing sanatorium-style Young Pioneer camps for 100,000 eighth- and ninth-grade students for their use during the summer vacation.

　　苏联减低物价后贸易量大增       
    今年国家社会保险预算达二百余亿卢布
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：苏联自三月一日第四次减低物价以后，一个月来全国各地的贸易量已大大增加。来自苏联各地的通讯指出，人民对上等的纺织品、钢琴、首饰、机器脚踏车和汽车的需求量大增。不仅在各大城市而且在边远的地区也是如此。例如西伯利亚鄂木斯克州的农民，最近总共购置了约五千架无线电收音机、三千架缝纫机、一千五百架留声机、四千辆脚踏车、九百辆机器脚踏车和汽车。过去农民主要只是购买印花布和假缎，现在他们却要购买各式各样的绸缎、绉纱和羊毛绒布了。
    白俄罗斯乡村中的贸易量已增加了百分之二十。在三月上半月，爱沙尼亚的集体农民比二月上半月多买了价值一百万卢布的货物，乡村中的贸易量增加了一倍。立陶宛各商店现在每天要比二月份多售出百分之二十到二十五的腊肠、糖果、糕饼及其他食品。
    各地的贸易网已经大为扩充。例如白俄罗斯的乡村中今年新开了三百个商店，阿尔泰、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区和西伯利亚其他地区的城市与乡村中，也新开了许多百货商店和专业商店。爱沙尼亚各城市与乡村中今年将开设三百余个商店。
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联一九五一年国家社会保险预算已获批准，预算总额达二百一十一亿卢布，较去年增加了三十亿卢布。
    全苏工会中央理事会国家社会保险金管理局副局长吉克登科在三月三十日的劳动报上撰文称：战后几年间苏联国家社会保险预算约已增加了一倍。这是因为苏联国民经济发展、国民收入上升的缘故。国民经济各部门的劳动人民无例外地享受社会保险金。国家担负了医疗、休假、年老保险，以及工人丧失工作能力时的津贴，同时由于政府和工会采取预防及其他措施，已使劳动人民的疾病和丧失工作能力的情形有规律地逐年减少，而休息及医疗条件则不断地改善着。去年约有二百五十万人在全苏工会主办的疗养院和保健机关内度过假日。今年已拨出十二亿七千万卢布作为疗养院和休息所的经费，较去年增加了一亿五千八百万卢布。在发展休息所和疗养院的建筑物方面已拨出二亿三千五百五十万卢布。在发展文化、教育和体育机关以及旅行中心方面已拨出二亿六千四百五十万卢布。在组织特别营养的食物方面已拨出四千二百万卢布，较去年增加了六百万卢布。关于妇女和儿童的福利事业，今年的妇女产假津贴增加了一亿二千四百万卢布，总数达十四亿九千五百万卢布。今年将有二百六十五万儿童在少年先锋营度过暑假，全苏工会正为十万名八、九年级的学生组织疗养院式的少年先锋营，供他们在暑期使用。
