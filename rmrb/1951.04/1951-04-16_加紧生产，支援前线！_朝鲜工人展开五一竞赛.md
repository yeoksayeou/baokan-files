Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th: According to TASS, in Korea, factories and enterprises are fervently launching a May Day labor competition under the slogan "Everything for the Frontlines! Everything for Victory!" Workers are pledging to intensify production, reduce costs, increase labor productivity, and complete production plans ahead of schedule.

　　Workers at the factory headed by factory director Kim Song-guk (transliteration) are producing twice as much daily as planned. Workers in the production department headed by Li Dang-he (transliteration) had already completed a quarter of the year's plan by March 20th, reduced production costs by 20%, and reached pre-war production levels. In this department, 60% of the workers are women who only started working after the war began.

　　Miners are also working hard. In a mining team led by Kim Chang-saeng (transliteration), they exceed their production targets by one or two times every day.

　　加紧生产，支援前线！
　  朝鲜工人展开五一竞赛
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社平壤十三日讯：朝鲜各工厂、企业在“一切为了前线！一切为了胜利！”的口号下，正热烈展开五一劳动竞赛。工人们保证加紧生产、减低成本、提高劳动生产率、并提前完成生产计划。
    由金性国（译音）任厂长的工厂工人，每日生产量比预定计划增加了一倍。由李当何（译音）主持的生产部门工人，在三月二十日已经完成全年计划的四分之一，将生产成本减低了百分之二十，并已达到战前的生产水平。在这个部门里，百分之六十的工人都是妇女，她们是在战争开始后才开始工作的。
    矿工们同样地努力工作。在金昌生（译音）领导的一个矿工队里，每天都超过完成生产目标一倍或两倍。
