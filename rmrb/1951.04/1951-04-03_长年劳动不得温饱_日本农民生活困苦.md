(Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd dispatch) According to TASS, Japanese farmers are suffocating under the weight of exorbitant taxes, lack of land, and the oppression of rural exploiters. According to a survey by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, out of a total of 6,176,422 farmer households, 2,522,355 cultivate no more than half a "cho" (町步) of land per household (approximately 0.99 hectares per "cho"); 3,312,396 households cultivate between half a "cho" and two "cho" of land. Therefore, the vast majority of farmer families have very little land.

Due to heavy taxes, Japanese farmers are becoming increasingly impoverished. The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that figures from a survey conducted in Takamatsu Village, Yamagata Prefecture, show that 44 percent of farmers' income is used to pay exorbitant taxes, 34 percent is used for fertilizers, repairs, and the purchase of farm implements and other production costs, leaving only 22 percent for their living expenses.

Most farmer families labor for years and make no profit. This is true not only for poor farmers but also for middle peasants. The National Tax Agency conducted a survey of ordinary farmer families in Kise Village, near Maebashi, and found that each household lost an annual average of 16,275 yen. Statistics from the Gunma Prefecture government show that the 2,271 farmer families surveyed had an average debt of 18,165 yen per household. According to press reports, farmers often sell their draft cattle and dairy cows to pay taxes and cover their losses, thus becoming tenant farmers.

### 长年劳动不得温饱  日本农民生活困苦

　　长年劳动不得温饱        
    日本农民生活困苦
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社东京讯：日本农民已因苛捐杂税、缺乏土地和农村剥削者的压迫被压得透不过气来。据农林省调查，在总共六百十七万六千四百二十二个农民家庭中，有二百五十二万二千三百五十五户所耕种的土地每户不超过半町步（按一町步约合百分之九十九公顷）；有三百三十一万二千三百九十六户耕种从半町步到二町步的土地。因此，绝大多数的农民家庭只有很少的土地。
    由于捐税苛重，日本农民是越来越贫穷了。读卖新闻载称：在山形县高松村调查所得的数字说明：农民们的收入以百分之四十四用于缴纳苛捐杂税，百分之三十四用于肥料、修理和购买农具及其他生产费用，只有百分之二十二余下来作为他们的生活费。
    大多数的农民家庭都是长年劳动而得不偿失。不仅贫农如此，连中农也是一样。国家税务局曾在前桥近郊木濑村调查一般农民的家庭，发现每户每年赔累一万六千二百七十五日元。群马县县政府的统计数字表明，被调查的二千二百七十一个农民家庭，平均每户负债一万八千一百六十五日元。据各报报道，常有农民出售他们的食用牛和乳牛，以缴纳赋税和弥补他们所遭受的损失，并因而沦为雇农。
