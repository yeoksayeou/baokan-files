    (20) When Wang Shan heard this, he panicked: It's really crazy, only collecting cotton stalks but not cotton flowers, that's terrible! While he was anxious, it just so happened that the technical cadre, Comrade Lao Liu, arrived in the village.
    (21) Wang Shan hurriedly pulled Comrade Lao Liu to the field to look at the cotton. After carefully examining it, Comrade Liu said, "Don't be afraid, as long as you carefully strengthen the pruning work, you will definitely have a good harvest!"
    (22) Wang Shan, following the principle of "densely prune the sides, sparsely prune the tops," carefully and meticulously pruned and topped the plants between the Great Heat and the Beginning of Autumn. As expected, the cotton plants all produced bolls. The villagers all praised his cotton as good.
    (23) When the Beginning of Heat arrived, the cotton matured. Everyone in the mutual aid group came to harvest the cotton. They collected the cotton from the cotton plants with more good bolls separately and kept it as seed.

    （二十）王山一听，心里也慌了起来：真是要发了疯，只收棉柴不收花，那就糟了！他正在着急，赶巧技术干部老刘同志到了村里。
    （二十一）王山急忙拉着老刘同志到地里看棉花。刘同志仔细看过后便说：“不要怕，只要细心地加强整枝工作，就一定有好收成！”
    （二十二）王山就在“密打旁，稀打尖”的原则下，在大暑立秋之间，精细严密地整枝、打?。果然棉棵都挂了桃。老乡们都称赞他的棉花好。
    （二十三）处暑时棉花成熟了。互助组内都来收棉花。他们把好瓣多的棉棵上的棉花另外收藏起来，留作种籽。
