　　They Have Begun to Recognize the Truth
    —American Prisoner of War in Korea Awakens
    Ding Gu
    Truth conquers all! More than two hundred soldiers of the American and British invading armies, after being captured by the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army, and after being educated and experiencing the reality by the Korean people and the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army, gradually recognized the crimes of American imperialism in invading Korea and the justice of the war against America waged by the Korean and Chinese people. They also held a peace rally, expressing their desire to strive for lasting world peace.
    These more than two hundred prisoners of war originally belonged to the 1st Marine Division, 7th Infantry Division, and 3rd Division of the American invading army, and the 41st Independent Commando of the British Royal Navy. They were all captured by the Volunteer Army in the Changjin Lake area at the end of last year. After these disheveled, haggard, and ragged prisoners arrived at a certain prisoner-of-war camp of the Volunteer Army, they were first given care in their lives by the Volunteer Army, allowing them to be warm and well-fed. They began to realize that what they had heard before being captured, saying that the Volunteer Army abused prisoners, was completely deceptive nonsense. Their sense of fear gradually disappeared. Then, the staff of the Volunteer Army gave them several reports, making them realize what kind of dirty deeds they were doing under the banner of the "United Nations." Former Lieutenant Company Commander McSman of the 11th Regiment of the 1st Marine Division of the U.S. Army wrote in his study notes: "At first, it was difficult for me to believe that the United States was committing aggression... Gradually, I began to accept those reports step by step... The reports were always so moving, powerful, and full of facts." Former Private Quillin of the 5th Regiment of the 1st Marine Division of the U.S. Army said in a letter to his wife: "We have learned a lot in the past month, and I have gained a lot. We used to be too indifferent to politics, which is too bad."
    Under the education of the Volunteer Army, they quickly realized that they had been fooled by the American and British warmongers, and felt ashamed for participating in this bloody crime. Former Sergeant Lopinaato of the 31st Regiment of the 7th Division of the U.S. Army said in a letter to his wife: "The treatment I can get here is much better than what I get from so-called 'friends' in the country. By 'friends' I mean Truman and other warmongers who levy high taxes and are pushing us to destruction. You must help me tell all my friends to wake up and fight the capitalists."
    Former Captain Parkham, the company commander of the 2nd Company of the 31st Regiment of the 7th Division of the U.S. Army, wrote in an article for the "New Life News" run by the prisoners themselves: "We owe too much to the Korean and Chinese people. How can we repay them? We can only study hard and be politically sober forever. Chinese people, we salute you!" The awakened prisoners actively wanted to take action to express their desire to fight for lasting world peace. On January 18, at an evening party, Sergeant Olson of the 1st Battalion of the 31st Regiment of the 7th Division of the U.S. Army proposed a suggestion to all the prisoners. He suggested that all the prisoners write a letter of peace appeal to the United Nations, requesting the United Nations to accept the proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue put forward by the People's Republic of China. His suggestion was quickly responded to by the prisoners. Many prisoners signed to support Olson's opinion. All the prisoners began to study the "Declaration to the People of the World" of the Second World Peace Congress and the Stockholm Peace Appeal, and unanimously demanded to hold a peace rally.
    The prisoners democratically elected a preparatory committee to actively prepare. Sergeant Harrison of the Military Police Company of the 1st Marine Division of the U.S. Army worked overnight to write the draft of the "Appeal to the United Nations." Mophi, a communication soldier of the 41st Independent Commando of the British Royal Navy, and Phillips, a private of the Transportation Battalion of the 1st Marine Division of the U.S. Army, were busy preparing slogans for the meeting and arranging the venue. Although Olson suffered from a stomach ailment, he still insisted on writing his speech overnight.
    On February 11, a peace rally was held. There was a slogan at the venue: "Every signature on the peace appeal is a nail in the coffin of warmongers such as Truman and MacArthur!"
    Olson delivered a speech on behalf of the preparatory committee. He said: "Yesterday we were still deceived people, but today we have become people who support peace. This fact alone will make the imperialist elements tremble, which means that their doomsday is coming." At the meeting, all 279 prisoners present unanimously passed the "Appeal to the United Nations" drafted by the preparatory committee. The appeal condemned the disasters caused by American and British imperialism in Korea and protested against the United Nations' illegal passage of the resolution to stigmatize the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor."
    In the final speech, the staff of the Volunteer Army, in addition to encouraging them to continue to make progress, also hoped that they would continue to fight for the cause of peace from now on. After the representative of the Volunteer Army finished speaking, the prisoners stood up and cheered.
    Many prisoners called this day a "milestone in their life history." Myles, a black private of the 24th Regiment of the 25th Division of the U.S. Army, wrote a poem to commemorate the meeting. The poem says:
    "The dark prison of imperialism,
    Can no longer lock us.
    Open the door of that prison,
    Welcome the light!
    Look at us
    Found the truth,
    With full enthusiasm
    Support it,
    Unite with all our strength
    Fight for the truth!"
    Under the light of truth, those who have been deceived and blinded by the warmongers have begun to awaken!

### 他们开始认识了真理——侵朝美军俘虏在觉醒中

　　他们开始认识了真理       
    ——侵朝美军俘虏在觉醒中
    丁谷
    真理战胜一切！两百多名美、英侵略军的士兵，在被中国人民志愿军俘掳以后，受到朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军的教育和实际的体验，逐渐认识了美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的罪恶，认识了朝、中人民所进行的抗美战争的正义性。他们并且举行拥护和平大会，表示了自己要为争取世界持久和平而努力的愿望。
    这两百多名俘虏原来分属于美国侵略军陆战第一师、步兵第七师、第三师和英国皇家海军第四一独立突击队，他们都是去年年底在长津湖地区被志愿军俘掳的。这些蓬头垢面、形容憔悴、衣衫褴褛的俘虏们来到志愿军的某俘掳营以后，首先就受到了志愿军所给予的生活上的照顾，使他们得到了温饱。他们开始认识到他们在被俘以前听到过的说什么志愿军虐待俘虏的话，完全是欺骗他们的鬼话。他们的疑惧心理逐渐消失了。接着，志愿军的工作人员给他们作了几次报告，使他们认识了他们在“联合国”的旗帜下干的是什么勾当。前美军陆战一师十一团中尉连长麦司曼在写他的学习心得时写道：“起初，很难使我相信美国是犯着侵略罪行的……渐渐地，我开始一步步地接受了那些报告……报告总是那么动人、有力、而且有众多的事实。”前美陆战一师第五团上等兵奎林在给他妻子的信中说：“在过去一个月内，我们学习得不少，我的收获很多。我们过去太不关心政治，这是太坏了。”
    在志愿军的教育之下，他们很快认识了他们过去是受了美、英战争贩子的愚弄，而对他们自己参加了这种血腥罪行感到愧悔。前美军第七师三十一团中士罗平纳脱在给他妻子的信中说：“我在这里所能得到的待遇，比之我从国内的所谓“朋友”那里所得到的要好得多。我所说的“朋友”，是指杜鲁门以及其他战争贩子们，他们强征高税，他们正把我们推向毁灭。你必须帮助我告诉我所有的朋友，要他们觉醒起来，与资本家作斗争。”
    前美军第七师三十一团二连上尉连长派克姆，在给俘虏们自己办的“新生报”写的一篇稿件上写道：“我们对朝、中人民所欠的太多了，我们怎样报答他们呢？我们只有好好学习，做个在政治上永远清醒的人。中国人民，我们向你致敬！”开始觉醒了的俘虏们积极要想有所行动，来表示他们为世界持久和平而斗争的愿望。一月十八日，在一次晚会上，前美军第七师三十一团一营上士欧森向全体俘虏提出了一项建议。他建议由全体俘虏向联合国写一封和平呼吁书，要求联合国接受中华人民共和国所提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的各项建议。他的建议很快得到俘虏们的响应。许多俘虏都签名支持欧森的意见。全体俘虏开始学习第二届世界和平大会的“告全世界人民的宣言”和斯德哥尔摩和平呼吁书，一致要求举行拥护和平大会。
    俘虏们民主选举了一个筹备委员会，积极进行筹备。前美军陆战一师宪兵连中士赫里逊连夜赶写“致联合国呼吁书”的草稿。前英国皇家海军四一独立突击队通讯兵莫菲和前美军陆战一师辎重营上等兵菲力浦斯两人忙着拟制大会标语和布置会场。欧森虽然胃病发作，仍然坚持连夜赶写演讲词。
    二月十一日，拥护和平大会举行了。在会场上有一条这样的标语：“和平呼吁书上的每一个签名，就是杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟等战争贩子们棺材盖上的一颗钉子！”
    欧森代表筹委会发表演说。他说：“昨天我们还是受愚弄的人，今天我们却成为拥护和平的人了。仅仅是这一事实，就会使帝国主义分子们发抖，这意味着他们的末日将要到了，”在大会上，全体到会俘虏二百七十九人一致通过了筹备委员会所拟的“致联合国呼吁书”。呼吁书谴责美、英帝国主义在朝鲜所造成的灾难，并抗议联合国非法通过污蔑中华人民共和国为“侵略者”的决议案。
    志愿军工作人员在最后讲话中除勉励他们继续进步外，并希望他们从现在起继续为和平事业而奋斗。志愿军代表讲话毕，俘虏们全场起立欢呼。
    许多俘虏把这一天称为他们“生命史上的里程碑”。前美军二十五师二十四团上等兵黑人迈尔斯写了一首诗，纪念这次大会。这首诗说：
    “帝国主义的阴暗牢狱，
    再锁不住我们。
    打开那牢狱的门，
    迎接光明吧！
    看我们
    找到了真理，
    以满腔的热诚
    拥护它，
    全力团结
    为真理而斗争！”
    在真理的光辉下，被战争贩子们所欺骗蒙蔽的人开始觉醒了！
