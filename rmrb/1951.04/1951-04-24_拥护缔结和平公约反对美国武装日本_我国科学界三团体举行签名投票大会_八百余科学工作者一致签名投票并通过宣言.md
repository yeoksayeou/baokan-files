Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd:

　　To respond to the calls from the Chinese People's Anti-American Aid Korea General Association on March 14th and April 5th, the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, and the United Office of the Chinese Social Science Research Associations jointly convened the Beijing Science Community Signature and Voting Rally in Support of Concluding a Peace Pact and Opposing US Arming of Japan on the 22nd of this month. Participating in the conference were over 885 natural and social science workers in Beijing, including Guo Moruo, Wu Yuzhang, Chen Boda, Li Siguang, Fan Wenlan, Ai Siqi, Xie Juezai, Chen Hansheng, Ding Xilin, Zeng Zhaolun, Chen Fengtong, Wang Kunlun, Guo Dali, Wang Xuewen, Xia Kangnong, Tao Menghe, Qian Sanqiang, Yan Jici, Tang Yongtong, Ye Qisun, Gao Shiqi, Feng Youlan, Ding Zan, Mei Ru'ao, Chen Yuan, Pei Wenzhong, Xu Bingchang, He Lin, Jian Bozan, Zheng Xin, Jin Yuelin, and Li Zong'en.

　　The venue was decorated with Picasso's famous painting "Peace Dove Flying" and a huge banner that read "Scientific Workers Strengthen Unity to Strive to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression."

　　Li Siguang, the Executive Chairman of the presidium, delivered the opening speech. He said: Science is for the benefit of mankind. American imperialism is expanding its aggression and using science to slaughter people, making it a criminal against humanity and also a criminal against science. Our scientific community has a responsibility to fight against such criminals. Today, our signing and voting is a declaration of our determination to stop the aggression of American imperialism.

　　Following this, Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, reported on the significance of signing in support of concluding a peace pact and voting against US arming of Japan. He pointed out that all Chinese people should sign and vote on these two matters to strengthen and encourage the anti-aggression struggle of peace-loving people around the world.

　　After President Guo's report, all 885 scientific workers present unanimously signed the World Peace Council's declaration—regarding the conclusion of a peace pact—and voted against the US arming of Japan.

　　The conference also passed the declaration of the three organizations supporting the conclusion of a peace pact and opposing the US arming of Japan.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: The All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, and the United Office of the Chinese Social Science Research Associations issued a declaration on the 22nd of the Signature and Voting Rally of the Three Organizations of the Chinese Scientific Community in Support of Concluding a Peace Pact and Opposing US Arming of Japan. The full text is as follows:

　　Today, our three organizations of the Chinese scientific community called on Beijing scientific workers to gather in Beijing, unanimously sign, warmly support the declaration of the First World Peace Council on the conclusion of a peace pact, and unanimously vote against the US arming of Japan, oppose a separate peace treaty with Japan by the United States, and demand the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.

　　We believe that in order to defend world peace and protect human culture from being harmed by another world war, every conscientious person in the world today should take immediate action, using the power of hundreds of millions of people to demand that the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France conclude a peace pact to clarify the current international atmosphere of war. And in order to safeguard the security and peace of the Far East and prevent Japanese fascist militarism from rising again with the support of American imperialists, opposing US arming of Japan, opposing a separate peace treaty with Japan by the United States, and promoting a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan has become an urgent task for the people of Asia and Australia, especially the Chinese people.

　　We Chinese scientific workers deeply remember the towering crimes committed by the Japanese fascist bandits against our cultural and scientific undertakings on the Chinese mainland, and we will never forget the continuous oppression and destruction of Chinese cultural and scientific undertakings by American imperialism and its running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. In the dark era of American-Chiang rule in China, we felt resentment and shame for our inability to exert our strength. Today, in the bright world of the people's motherland, we feel excited and honored by the great prospects for scientific development. Therefore, we must never tolerate the resurgence of dark ignorance or the destruction of peaceful work. In order to defend the peaceful construction of the people's motherland, we hope that every scientific worker in the country will take action, stand in the glorious ranks of the anti-American and aid-Korea movement, and fight to the end for the cause of peace.

　　拥护缔结和平公约反对美国武装日本
　  我国科学界三团体举行签名投票大会
　  八百余科学工作者一致签名投票并通过宣言
    【新华社二十三日讯】中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会、中华全国科学技术普及协会、中国社会科学各研究会联合办事处等三团体为响应中国人民抗美援朝总会三月十四日暨四月五日的号召，于本月二十二日联合召开北京科学界拥护缔结和平公约、反对美国武装日本签名投票大会。参加大会的有在京的自然科学和社会科学工作者郭沫若、吴玉章、陈伯达、李四光、范文澜、艾思奇、谢觉哉、陈翰笙、丁西林、曾昭抡、陈凤桐、王昆仑、郭大力、王学文、夏康农、陶孟和、钱三强、严济慈、汤用彤、叶企荪、高士其、冯友兰、丁瓒、梅汝璈、陈垣、裴文中、徐炳昶、贺麟、翦伯赞、郑昕、金岳霖、李宗恩等八百八十五人。
    大会会场高悬着毕加索的名画《和平鸽在飞翔》和巨幅标语“科学工作者加强团结为保卫世界和平反对美国侵略而奋斗”。
    大会由主席团执行主席李四光致开会词。他说：科学是为人类谋幸福的。美帝国主义扩大侵略，用科学屠杀人民，是人类的罪人，也是科学的罪人。我们科学界有责任与这种罪人作斗争。今天我们的签名和投票是表示我们有决心制止美帝国主义的侵略。
    接着，中国科学院院长郭沫若报告了签名拥护缔结和平公约和投票反对美国武装日本的意义。他指出：对这两件事全中国人民都应该签名和投票，以加强和鼓励全世界爱好和平人民的反侵略斗争。
    在郭院长报告后，到会的八百八十五位科学工作者一致在世界和平理事会宣言——关于缔结和平公约——上签了名；并投票反对美国武装日本。
    大会并通过三团体拥护缔结和平公约反对美国武装日本宣言。
    【新华社二十三日讯】中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会、中华全国科学技术普及协会、中国社会科学各研究会联合办事处于二十二日发表中国科学界三团体拥护缔结和平公约反对美国武装日本签名投票大会宣言。全文如下：
    我们中国科学界三团体号召北京科学工作者今天在北京集会，全体一致签名，热烈拥护第一届世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言，并一致投票，反对美国武装日本，反对对日单独媾和，要求缔结全面的对日和约。
    我们认为为了保卫世界和平，保卫人类文化不受到另一次大战的损害，全世界每个有良心的人，今天都应该立即采取行动，以亿万人的力量，来要求美、苏、中、英、法五大国家缔结和平公约，以澄清目前国际间的战争气氛。而为了维护远东的安全和平，防止日本法西斯军国主义在美帝国主义者的扶植之下再起，反对美国武装日本，反对美国对日单独媾和，促成一个全面的对日和约，就成为亚、澳各国人民，尤其是中国人民的紧急任务。
    我们中国的科学工作者深深记得日本法西斯强盗在中国大陆上对于我们的文化科学事业所犯的滔天罪行，我们更不会忘记美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮对于中国文化科学事业不断地压迫与摧残。在美蒋统治中国的黑暗时代，我们对于自身力量的无从发挥感到忿恨与羞愧，今天在人民祖国的光明天地里，我们对于科学发展的远大前程感到兴奋与光荣；因之我们决不能容忍黑暗愚昧的死灰复燃，和平工作的再遭破坏。为保卫人民祖国的和平建设，我们希望全国每一个科学工作者都行动起来，站到抗美援朝运动的光荣行列里，为和平事业战斗到底。
