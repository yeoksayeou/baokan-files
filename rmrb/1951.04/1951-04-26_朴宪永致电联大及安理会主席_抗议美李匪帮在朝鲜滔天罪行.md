　　Park Heon-young Cables UN General Assembly and Security Council Presidents
　　Protesting Heinous Crimes of the American-Syngman Rhee Gang in Korea
Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Pyongyang News: Park Heon-young, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a statement to the President of the United Nations General Assembly and the President of the Security Council on April 15, protesting the heinous crimes committed by the American and Syngman Rhee gangs. The statement said: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly protested to the United Nations against the American armed intervention in Korea and the appalling atrocities committed by the American and Syngman Rhee troops in Korea. However, the United Nations has not taken any measures to stop the atrocities of the American interventionists, which have aroused the justified indignation not only of the Korean people but also of democratic public opinion throughout the world.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has received many reports from areas liberated from enemy occupation, recounting the policy of mass slaughter of peaceful residents implemented by the American and Syngman Rhee bandit troops in various parts of Korea under their occupation. The American and Syngman Rhee bandit troops tortured the Korean people with extremely barbaric means, applied medieval cruel tortures, raped women, gouged out eyes, cut off ears and noses, chopped off hands and feet, disemboweled, dismembered living bodies, ran them over with tanks or buried them alive. Tens of thousands of Korean women, children, and elderly people were brutally murdered.

The statement listed several facts of the bloody atrocities of the American and Syngman Rhee gangs:

　　In early October 1950, American invading troops in Jiahe District, Paju County, Gyeonggi Province arrested 135 members of democratic political parties, people's organizations, and cadres of the district people's committee and their families, and dragged them onto the road and ran them over with tanks.

　　On October 9, 1950, Syngman Rhee bandit troops used knives to cut off the hands and feet of Shin Ki-soo, chairman of the People's Committee of Heungsin-ri, Yangcheon District, Gimpo County, then cut off his head, and then cut the body into pieces.

　　In early October 1950, fifty policemen in Jiahe District, Paju County, Gyeonggi Province arrested six children who were singing the Kim Il-sung song, cut off their lips and tongues, and then killed them. Then, the police put the bodies of these children on the road and drove all the children in the nearby villages there, pointing to the bodies of these children and threatening them that if they dared to sing the Kim Il-sung song, they would be killed in the same way.

　　In early November 1950, Syngman Rhee bandit troops in Paju-ri, Junnae District, Paju County, Gyeonggi Province killed seventy women and buried their crying children alive.

　　In November 1950, the American army drove 479 patriots and their families into the air-raid shelter of the Sincheon County Internal Affairs Department, sealed the entrance with soil, and suffocated the people inside. The American army used the same method to kill 104 people in the air-raid shelter of the county's Labor Party Committee. In Yuannam-ri, Syngman Rhee's troops locked more than 300 people in a warehouse and burned them alive. They also locked more than 80 children under the age of ten in another warehouse, beat them to death with sticks, or starved them to death there.

After the American army and Syngman Rhee's army invaded Taechon County, they killed Lee Eun-joon, a member of the Labor Party and chairman of the county farmers' alliance committee, who lived in Unnyeom-ri, Seo-gu. They cut off his ears and nose, gouged out his eyes, and skinned him alive.

The statement pointed out that there are countless examples of the American and Syngman Rhee gangs slaughtering the Korean people in this way. According to investigations, in Sincheon County, Hwanghae Province alone, the total number of civilians killed by the invading army was more than 25,000. In the entire area of Hwanghae Province, more than 100,000 people were killed. When the American army retreated, they drove a large number of residents to the south, and slaughtered more than half of them along the way. When the American and Syngman Rhee troops retreated from Yangyang County, Gangwon Province, they forced 25,380 people to go with them, most of whom were shot and killed or bombed to death by airplanes using machine guns and bombs.

The statement said: The inhumane American and Syngman Rhee troops raped countless women and girls in the areas temporarily occupied by them, and killed most of them. Kim Heung-guk, a farmer from Heungsin-ri, Yangcheon District, Gimpo County, who was forced to perform labor at Gimpo Airport, testified that American Air Force pilots locked more than 80 young Korean women in the basement of the airport and gang-raped them. In Dancheon District, Dancheon County, Hamgyeongnam-do, American and Syngman Rhee troops raped forty-two female teachers and students from the girls' school.

　　On November 5, 1950, two American soldiers stopped a passing couple on the streets of Kaesong, killed the husband, and raped the wife.

　　In November 1950, the American army raped a thirteen-year-old girl in Chunsuri, Chungsan District, Nyongbyon County, Pyonganbuk-do.

The statement continued: The vile and shameless American interventionists and their accomplices robbed the Korean people of their property, destroyed the homes of the Korean people, and destroyed Korea's national wealth and historical ancient cultural relics. They attempted to exterminate the Korean people and turn the Korean people's homeland into a desert of death.

When the American army retreated in December and January, it thoroughly destroyed and annihilated a large number of villages and farmhouses along the way. On January 2 this year, when the American and Syngman Rhee bandit troops retreated from Yangyang County, Gangwon Province, they specially organized arson squads to burn down many villages. They completely burned down the farmhouses in many villages and burned all the grain.

The American savages blew up important ancient architectural relics in Korea - the South Gate of Kaesong and the Kaesong Museum. They burned down the world-famous historical relic - the Buddhist temple of Naksan Temple in Yangyang. They thoroughly destroyed the ancient Gwanghwamun Gate in Seoul and the South Gate of Suwon, which are famous for their magnificent architecture.

The statement concluded: The American interventionists have committed heinous crimes of destroying Korea and collectively massacring the Korean people. They attempted to intimidate the Korean people, destroy the Korean people's will to resist, and obstruct the Korean people's struggle for the complete liberation of their country. But they will not achieve this goal. The atrocities of the interventionists can only arouse the Korean people's anger and hatred towards the American imperialists. The entire course of development of the Korean situation proves that the will of the Korean people is unconquerable. In response to the atrocities of the American interventionists, the Korean people will unite more closely under the banner of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and are fully determined to drive the hateful foreign aggressors out of the motherland. The Korean people firmly believe that they will be able to achieve final victory.

In addition to once again strongly protesting to the United Nations, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea hereby declares: All those who use the banner of the United Nations to cover up American aggression and help send armed forces of foreign interventionists to Korea to assist them in their criminal massacre of the Korean people and destruction of the Korean people's national treasures should bear the responsibility for the crimes committed in Korea together with the American interventionists. If the United Nations truly hopes to serve the cause of peace and the security of all peoples, it must immediately stop the atrocities of the American imperialists in Korea, punish the war criminals who organized or incited these atrocities; it must guarantee a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in accordance with the will of the peace-loving people of the world as expressed in the decision of the First Session of the World Peace Council. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea firmly demands its realization.

　　朴宪永致电联大及安理会主席
　  抗议美李匪帮在朝鲜滔天罪行
    【新华社二十三日讯】平壤消息：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永于四月十五日向联合国大会主席和安全理事会主席发出声明，抗议美、李匪帮所犯的滔天罪行。声明称：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾经一再向联合国抗议美国武装干涉朝鲜和美、李军队在朝鲜所犯的可怖暴行。但是，联合国迄今并未采取任何措施以制止美国干涉者暴行，这种暴行，不仅引起了朝鲜人民的而且引起了全世界民主公众的正当义愤。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府收到许多从敌人占领下解放出来的地区的报告，历诉美、李匪军在他们占领下的朝鲜各地，实行大量屠杀和平居民的政策。美李匪军以野蛮绝顶的手段残害朝鲜人民，施行中世纪的残酷拷问，强奸妇女、挖眼睛、割耳鼻、斩手脚、剖腹、支解活人的身体，用坦克轧死或者活埋。成千万的朝鲜妇女、儿童、和老年人都惨遭毒手。
    声明列举了美、李匪帮血腥暴行的若干事实：
    一九五零年十月初，美国侵略军在京畿道坡州县交河区逮捕了全区各民主政党的党员、人民团体的成员和区人民委员会的干部及其家属共一百三十五人，并将他们拉到公路上用坦克轧毙。
    一九五零年十月九日，李承晚匪军用刀斩去金浦县阳川区兴新里的里人民委员会主席申基洙的手足，然后把头砍下，再将尸体砍成碎块。
    一九五零年十月初，五十名警察在京畿道坡州县交河区把唱金日成之歌的六个儿童抓起来，割去他们的嘴唇和舌头，再把他们杀死。然后，警察把这些小孩子的尸体放在路上，再把附近村庄里所有的儿童赶到那里，指着这些儿童的尸体恫吓他们说，如果他们胆敢唱金日成之歌，就要照样把他们杀死。
    一九五零年十一月初，李承晚匪军在京畿道坡州县州内区坡州里杀死七十个妇女，并把她们的哭喊着的孩子活埋。
    一九五零年十一月，美军把四百七十九个爱国者及其家属赶进信川县内务署的防空洞里，用泥土把入口封起来，把里面的人活活闷死。美军并用同样的手段，在该县劳动党委员会的防空洞里杀死了一百零四人。在院南里，李承晚军队把三百多人锁在一间仓库里，活活烧死。他们又把八十多个不到十岁的儿童锁在另一间仓库里，用棍把他们打死或者使他们在那里饿死。
    美军和李承晚军侵入泰川县后，杀死了住在西区云念里的劳动党党员与县农民同盟委员会主席李殷俊。他们割掉他的耳鼻，挖去他的眼睛，剥掉他的皮，这样把他杀害了。
    声明指出：美、李匪帮这一类的残杀朝鲜人民的例子是数不尽的。据调查，仅黄海道信川县一地，被侵略军杀死的平民总数即在两万五千人以上。黄海道全境被杀者在十万人以上。美军在撤退的时候，把大批居民赶向南方，并在途中把他们屠杀过半。美、李匪军从江原道襄阳县撤退时，逼迫两万五千三百八十人和他们一同走，其中大半被飞机用机枪和炸弹打死和炸死。
    声明说：毫无人性的美、李匪军在暂时被他们占领的地区强奸了无数妇女和女孩子，又把她们之中的大部分人杀死。曾被迫在金浦机场从事劳役的金浦县阳川区兴新里的农民金兴国作证说：美国空军飞行员把八十多个朝鲜的青年妇女关在机场地下室里轮奸。在咸镜南道端川县端川区，美、李匪军强奸了女子学校的四十二个女教员和女学生。
    一九五零年十一月五日，两名美国士兵在开城街上拦住一对过路的夫妇，杀死了丈夫，强奸了妻子。
    一九五零年十一月，美军在平安北道宁边县忠山区春树里强奸一个十三岁的幼女。
    声明接着说：下流无耻的美国干涉者及其同谋犯抢劫朝鲜人民的财产，摧毁朝鲜人民的家园，摧毁朝鲜的民族财富和历史悠久的古代文化遗物。他们企图灭绝朝鲜人民，把朝鲜人民的祖国变成一片死亡的沙漠。
    美军于十二月和一月间撤退时，沿途彻底破坏和消灭大量村镇和农舍。今年一月二日，美、李匪军从江原道襄阳县撤退时，特别组织放火队，焚毁许多村庄。他们把许多村庄的农舍完全烧毁，并把全部粮食烧光。
    美国生番们炸毁了朝鲜重要的古代建筑遗物——开城南门和开城博物馆。他们焚毁了世界闻名的历史遗物——襄阳洛山寺的佛教庙宇。他们彻底破坏了以建筑雄伟驰名的、古老的汉城光华门和水原南门。
    声明最后说：美国干涉者犯了毁灭朝鲜和集体屠杀朝鲜人民的滔天罪行。他们企图吓倒朝鲜人民，摧毁朝鲜人民的反抗意志，阻挠朝鲜人民为彻底解放他们的国家而进行的斗争。但是他们是达不到这个目的的。干涉者的暴行只能激起朝鲜人民对美帝国主义者的愤怒与憎恨。朝鲜形势的整个发展过程，证明了朝鲜人民的意志是不可征服的。朝鲜人民为了答复美国干涉者的暴行，将更加紧密地团结在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的旗帜下，并且有充分的决心，把可恶的外国侵略者从祖国驱逐出去。朝鲜人民坚决相信，他们是能够获得最后胜利的。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府除再一次坚决向联合国提出抗议外，兹特声明：凡是利用联合国的旗帜掩护美国侵略、帮助派遣外国干涉者的武装部队到朝鲜去协助他们罪恶地屠杀朝鲜人民和破坏朝鲜人民的民族宝藏的人们，应该和美国干涉者一同担负在朝鲜所犯的罪行的责任。如果联合国真正希望为和平与各国人民的安全事业服务的话，它就必须立即制止美帝国主义者在朝鲜的暴行，惩办那些组织或挑起这些暴行的战争罪犯；必须保证按照世界和平理事会第一届会议的决定中所表现的全世界爱好和平人民的意志，和平解决朝鲜问题。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府坚决要求它的实现。
