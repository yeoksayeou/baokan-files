Supporting the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty, Opposing the United States' Arming of Japan
	Signature and Voting Campaign Launched by All Circles in the Capital
	People from all walks of life in the capital are enthusiastically launching a signature and voting campaign to support the conclusion of a peace treaty and oppose the United States' arming of Japan.

	Since early April, 400,000 workers, 600,000 farmers, over 100,000 students, and hundreds of thousands of citizens, as well as people from other circles in Beijing, have been swept up in a wave of current affairs political study. More than 30,000 teachers and staff from universities and middle schools, as well as tens of thousands of mass propaganda activists, have gone deep into neighborhoods and alleys to carry out propaganda. On the basis of patriotic education against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea among people from all walks of life, a signature and voting campaign to support the conclusion of a peace treaty and oppose the United States' arming of Japan has been launched. As of yesterday (April 22nd), according to available materials, more than 20,000 workers, over 300,000 suburban farmers, over 10,000 teachers and staff from schools such as Peking University and the Fourth Municipal Middle School, over 10,000 Hui people, over 1,000 people from the industrial and commercial circles, and over 301,000 residents from various districts have participated in the signature and voting, totaling about 642,000 people, which is nearly 30 percent of the city's population. This movement is still continuing to deepen and expand in order to welcome the "May 1st" grand demonstration climax.

	The methods of signing and voting are broad and flexible. The most important one is to combine accusations with mass meetings, representative meetings, small forums, and even large courtyard meetings by district. The people of Beijing, who have suffered greatly from the trampling of American and Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit spies, have accused the blood debts of losing fathers and sons and being ruined from the time of the Eight-Power Allied Forces to the Kuomintang's "confiscation." They shouted, "Blood debts must be repaid in blood," "Absolutely not allow American imperialism to rearm Japan," "The days of eating mixed noodles must not be turned back," "We want peace, not war!" Under extremely angry emotions, everyone raised their hands to pass the signature. Many people who could not attend the meeting voted and signed in a decentralized manner. Railway workers and workers in the fourth district's stores and shops in Dongbianmen collected more than 4,000 signatures from passengers and customers. Wu Ketian, a shop assistant in the oil and salt industry in the second district, used his spare time to encourage nearby residents to participate in the signature, reaching more than 120 people in one night.

	The signature and voting movement in Beijing proves that in addition to carrying out general patriotic education against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, it is also necessary to carry out special education on voting and signing. Because even among the organized masses where current affairs political education has been carried out relatively fully, some people still think that "signing and voting are useless" or think that "Japan cannot be armed," and therefore do not pay attention to signing and voting. Among the unorganized masses who have just begun to receive patriotic education against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, most do not understand the specific content and significance of signing and voting.

	Therefore, at the signature and voting meetings of organized masses in factories, schools, and industrial and commercial circles in Beijing, there are generally current affairs political reports on the peace movement. Then, the struggle of the peace movement is combined with the vital interests of the masses through reminiscences and accusations. Some also pass patriotic conventions at the same time. The final signature and voting truly become a political demonstration with a sufficient mass ideological foundation, and become a mobilization to continue to deepen the anti-US aggression and aid Korea movement.

	At the signature and voting meetings held by unorganized masses, such as the Hui people's anti-US aggression and aid Korea meeting, there are short and comprehensive current affairs reports, representative speeches that explain the peace movement by relating to reality and quoting the Koran, and accusations against the Japanese invaders. These are all closely centered on opposing the United States' arming of Japan and supporting the conclusion of a peace treaty, each explaining one or several aspects. More than 10,000 Hui people who attended the meeting generally had a correct understanding of signing and voting. However, some meetings have lengthy and unpopular current affairs and work reports from the eight major families in the United States and the thirty years of Soviet economic construction to the 13th police station, and empty speeches by representatives from all walks of life and guests without a center. The time for accusing the Japanese invaders is very long, and it overemphasizes the terrible nature of Japanese imperialism, such as saying: "If Japan comes again, not even chickens and dogs will be left." There is no necessary explanation for the signature in support of the conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers. As a result, many people confuse it with last year's peace signature, and some even confuse the peace treaty with the patriotic convention. These deviations are now being corrected.

### 拥护缔结和平公约，反对美国武装日本  首都各界展开签名投票运动

　　拥护缔结和平公约，反对美国武装日本
    首都各界展开签名投票运动
    首都各界人民热烈展开拥护缔结和平公约、反对美国武装日本的签名、投票运动。
    自四月初旬，北京市四十万工人、六十万农民、十余万学生及数十万市民以及其他各界人民都卷入了时事政治学习热潮。三万余大、中学校师生员工，以及数以万计的群众宣传积极分子，深入里弄胡同，进行宣传。在各界人民抗美援朝爱国教育基础上，展开拥护缔结和平公约、反对美国武装日本的签名、投票运动。截至昨日（二十二日）为止，根据已有材料，举行签名、投票者已有工人两万多人、郊区农民三十余万人、北京大学、市立第四中学等学校的师生员工一万余人、回民一万余人、工商界人士一千余人、各区居民三十万一千余人，共计约六十四万二千余人，几占全市人口百分之三十。现这一运动仍在继续深入与扩大，以迎接“五一”大示威高潮。
    签名、投票的方式广泛，灵活。最主要的一种是在群众大会、代表大会、小型座谈会以至分片的大杂院会上结合控诉举行。饱受美、日帝国主义、蒋匪特务蹂躏的北京人民，纷纷控诉自八国联军起以至国民党“劫收”时期丧父失子、破家荡产的血债。他们高呼：“血债血还”、“绝不许美帝国主义重新武装日本”、“吃混合面的日子不能再回头”、“要和平不要战争！”在极端愤激情绪下，全体举手通过签名。许多不能参加会议的群众则用分散的方式投票、签名。东便门铁路职工及四区店员工人，征集了四千多旅客、顾客的签名。二区油盐业店员吴科田，利用业余时间推动附近居民参加签名，一晚上就达到一百二十多人。
    北京的签名、投票运动证明：除了进行一般的抗美援朝爱国教育，还有必要进行关于投票、签名的特殊教育。因为即使在时事政治教育进行得比较充分的有组织群众中，仍有一部分人认为“签名、投票不顶用”，或认为“日本武装不起来”，因而对于签名、投票不重视。而在刚刚开始受抗美援朝教育的无组织群众中，则绝大部分不明白签名投票的具体内容及意义。
    因此，北京的工厂、学校、工商界等有组织群众的签名、投票大会上，一般都有关于和平运动的时事政治报告。然后通过回忆、控诉方式将和平运动的斗争和群众切身利益结合起来。有的同时通过爱国公约。最后举行的签名、投票就真正成为有充分群众思想基础的政治示威，又成为继续深入开展抗美援朝运动的动员。
    在无组织群众举行的签名、投票会议如回民抗美援朝大会上，有简短、全面的时事报告，有联系实际的引用可兰经说明和平运动的代表发言、有对于日寇的控诉。这些都紧紧围绕着反对美国武装日本、拥护缔结和平公约的中心，各各说明一个或几个侧面。到会的一万余回民群众大致都有了对于签名、投票的正确了解。但有些会议则有着从美国八大家族、苏联三十年经济建设说到第十三派出所的冗长、不通俗的时事和工作报告，无中心的空泛的各界代表及来宾的讲话。控诉日寇的时间很长，又过分强调日本帝国主义可怕，如说：“日本要再来、鸡犬不留”等。对于拥护五大国缔结和平公约的签名没有必要的说明。因而许多群众将它与去年的和平签名混淆起来，更有人把和平公约与爱国公约混为一谈。这些偏差现正在纠正中。（附图片）
