"Eliminate the Heart Disease, Actively Produce"
    Wen'an Peasants Support the Government's Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries
    Editor Comrade:
    In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, Wen'an County, Hebei Province, has raised the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of the vast number of peasants.
    In the past, the Wen'an County People's Government had a "boundless leniency" bias in its work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements seriously threatened the people. For example, in the spring of 1950, the county's supply and marketing cooperative purchased a large quantity of reeds in order to help disaster victims engage in sideline production and supply weaving materials. Counter-revolutionary elements, attempting to starve the disaster victims, set fire to and burned 300,000 jin of reeds. In addition, some reactionary landlords seized land distributed to peasants and demolished houses distributed to peasants, making it impossible for peasants to concentrate on production. The peasants reflected, "Nurturing illness leads to death, nurturing villains harms the people; the People's Government is too 'lenient'."
    After the Central People's Government promulgated the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries," the peasants were extremely happy and gathered to展开热烈讨论展开热烈讨论hold enthusiastic discussions. People said, "The People's Government has opened its eyes and is going to cure the people's heart disease." Wang Lianwan from Qian Sunzhang Village said, "This regulation is like a small hoe in the hands of peasants, which can weed out the grass next to the crops; this regulation is like an insecticide that can kill the insects that eat the crops; let our green wheat seedlings and snow-white cotton all grow beautifully!"
    After the government arrested a group of counter-revolutionary elements with heinous crimes, more than 43,000 peasants in all 331 villages in the county gathered separately to carry out accusations. Many peasants also actively reported and helped the government arrest counter-revolutionary criminals.
    After a group of counter-revolutionary criminals were arrested and punished, the peasants' political consciousness and production enthusiasm greatly increased. For example, Fan Dajie, a military family member from Shixi Village, was allocated a landlord's house during the land reform, but the landlord did not vacate the house, and she did not dare to speak up. After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Fan Dajie righteously said to the landlord, "You move out, I'll live in this house!" Chen Xiaodun, a peasant from Dongyang Village, was allocated six mu of land during the land reform, but it was taken back by landlord Chai Yuyin the year before last. Last year, the district government helped him recover the land, but he was always afraid that it would not grow well, so he did not apply fertilizer or weed, and the grass and crop seedlings grew as tall as each other. After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, he concentrated on planting. He said, "I will plant these six mu of land well, with one cart of fertilizer per mu, and guarantee that it will not be abandoned again." Now the peasants throughout the county are enthusiastically launching a patriotic production increase campaign. Some peasants said, "Suppressing the counter-revolutionaries and eliminating the heart disease will enable us to concentrate on production."

    Dug Out the Bad Roots, the Factory Has Changed Its Appearance
    After the Nanjing Radio Factory Struggled Against the Special Agents, Production
    Enthusiasm is High
    Editor Comrade:
    To do a good job in production, we must resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries. After the employees of the Nanjing Public Radio Factory struggled against Shao Xiechang, a special agent lurking in the factory who sabotaged production, production enthusiasm immediately soared.
    Shao Xiechang lurked in the radio factory and used various malicious methods to damage more than 200 transformers, causing serious rework and waste, which affected the completion of production tasks. In the past, the factory always thought that this was a technical problem, until the special agent Shao Xiechang was exposed, did they find the root cause of the poor production.
    After Shao Xiechang was arrested, the production situation in the factory greatly changed. The third group, where the counter-revolutionary element Shao Xiechang was previously located, used to have a serious rework phenomenon for a long time, but now it has greatly changed. The production enthusiasm of the group's employees has greatly increased: in the past, one person could wind two transformers a day, but now they can wind four. In the past, it took 0.8 hours to wind each wire, but now it only takes 0.35 hours, increasing efficiency by more than double. The workers said: The special agents have been eliminated, the heart disease has been removed, our eyes are bright, and production is also energetic. Old Master Jiang Duanyang from the cold working workshop used to be negative in his work and liked to complain, and the special agents tried to pull him into the "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army." After this study of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Jiang Duanyang realized that he could no longer fall behind and became more active in his work. He completed a production task that required 800 work hours in 400 work hours, and without working overtime. He insisted on working even when blisters formed on his hands during mold making.
    The exposure of Shao Xiechang's crimes has led many technicians to criticize their "supra-political" thinking. Zhou Songde (engineer), the former leader of the third group, was unwilling to interfere in politics in the past; special agent Shao Xiechang happened to be lurking in his group. After Shao Xiechang was arrested, Zhou Songde said, "In the past, I didn't ask about politics, but politics came to ask me. Now I clearly realize that production cannot be done well without asking about politics." Wang Xianghua, deputy director of the manufacturing department, said, "In the past, we were buried in planning; but even with a plan, it could not be implemented, and a week's work could not be completed in three weeks. Now that the government suppresses counter-revolutionaries and arrests the special agents in the factory, the workers' production enthusiasm has increased, and the production results have exceeded the original plan by 50%. This proves that if the special agents are not eliminated and the employees are not mobilized, no plan can be completed, and production cannot be done well."

　　铲除了特务，生产也有了劲！
　“除了心病，积极生产”  文安农民拥护政府镇压反革命编辑同志：
    河北省文安县在镇压反革命运动中，提高了广大农民的政治觉悟和生产积极性。
    过去，文安县人民政府在镇压反革命工作中有着“宽大无边”的偏向，反革命分子的破坏活动严重地威胁着人民。如一九五○年春，本县供销合作社为了帮助灾民进行副业生产，供应织席的原料，曾经买了大批苇子。反革命分子妄想把灾民饿死，放了一把火，就烧掉了三十万斤苇子。另外还有一些反动地主，夺去农民分得的土地，拆毁农民分得的房屋，使农民不能安心生产。农民们反映：“养病终丧命，养奸害人民；人民政府太‘宽大’了。”
    中央人民政府公布“惩治反革命条例”后，农民们都高兴极了，纷纷集会，展开热烈讨论。人们说：“人民政府睁开眼了，要替人民治心病了。”前孙章村王连万说：“这个条例好比一把小锄，拿在农民手里，能把庄稼苗旁的草锄掉；这个条例好比杀虫药，能把吃庄稼的虫子杀死；让我们田里绿油油的麦苗、雪白的棉花都长得美美的！”
    政府逮捕了一批罪大恶极的反革命分子后，全县三百三十一个村，有四万三千多个农民分别集会进行控诉。不少农民并积极检举和帮助政府逮捕反革命罪犯。
    逮捕和惩治了一批反革命罪犯之后，农民们的政治觉悟和生产情绪大大提高了。如史西町村军人家属范大杰，在土地改革时分了地主的房，地主不腾房子，她也不敢说话。镇压反革命后，范大杰理直气壮地向地主说：“你搬出去，我住这房！”东羊町村农民陈小墩在土地改革时分了六亩地，前年被地主柴玉印夺回去。去年区政府帮他收回了地，但他总怕种不长，不上粪，不锄草，草和庄稼苗长得一般高。镇压反革命后，他就安心种了。他说：“我要把这六亩地种好，一亩地上一车粪，保证不再叫它荒了。”现全县农民正热情地展开爱国丰产竞赛。有的农民说：“镇压了反革命，除掉了心病，我们就能安心生产了。”　    含华
　挖掉了坏根子，工厂变了样  南京无线电厂斗争特务后，生产情
        绪高涨编辑同志：
    要搞好生产，必须坚决镇压反革命。南京市公营无线电厂职工斗争了潜伏在厂内破坏生产的特务劭协昌后，生产情绪立即高涨。
    劭协昌潜伏在无线电厂，用种种恶毒办法，损坏变压器二百余个，造成严重反工浪费现象，影响到生产任务的完成。以前厂里一直认为这是技术上的问题，直到检举了特务劭协昌，才找到了生产搞不好的根源。
    劭协昌被逮捕后，厂里的生产情况就大有改变。反革命分子劭协昌以前所在的第三组，过去长期存在严重的反工现象，现在已经大大改变了。该组职工们生产积极性大为提高：过去一个人每天绕两只变压器，现在可以绕四只。以前绕线每只需○·八小时，现在只要○·三五小时，提高效率一倍以上。工人们说：特务铲除了，心病去掉了，眼睛亮了，生产也有劲了。冷作间江端阳老师傅，过去工作消极、爱发牢骚，特务就企图拉他参加“反共救国军”。经过这次镇压反革命的学习后，江端阳认识到不能再落后了，工作也积极起来。需要八百个工的生产任务，他四百个工就完成了，而且没有加班。制模时手上磨起了泡，他还坚持工作。
    劭协昌罪行的揭露，使很多技术人员批判了自己“超政治”的思想。前第三组组长周颂德（工程师），过去不愿过问政治；特务劭协昌刚好潜伏在他那一组。劭协昌被捕后，周颂德说：“过去我不问政治，但政治却来问我了。我现在才清楚地认识，不问政治生产就搞不好。”制造室副主任王祥华说：“以前我们埋头搞计划；但有了计划却无法贯彻，一个星期的工作三个星期还不能完成。现在政府镇压反革命，逮捕了厂里的特务，工人生产情绪提高了，生产成绩超过原计划的百分之五十。这就证明：如果特务不清除，职工没有发动，什么计划都不能完成，生产也无法搞好。”　      石尚幸
