    To the Editor:
    Wangcun in the Fifth District of Lucheng County, Shanxi Province, is a village that has already completed land reform. However, the cadres and farmers of this village are not vigilant enough, and they always feel that once land reform is completed, the world will be at peace. As a result, three out of the seven landlord-rich peasant households in the village are not properly engaged in production, and are taking the opportunity to carry out retaliation. Landlord Wang Zhenfu is a Catholic, and in order to achieve the goal of retaliation, he often says to the peasants: "God has eyes, good deeds will be rewarded, and evil deeds will be punished; if it is not repaid now, the time has not yet come." When some of the peasants were deceived by his propaganda and approached him, he further spread rumors saying: "The future world belongs to Catholicism." The peasants with blurred thinking were very frightened when they heard this. Three peasant households who had been allocated Wang Zhenfu's land, houses, bricks, and tiles secretly returned these allocated items to Wang Zhenfu out of fear. Recently, the county people's government discovered this incident and, in addition to returning these retaliatory properties to the peasants, also gave these retaliatory landlords severe punishment.

    潞城王村地主王振福利用天主教进行倒算编辑同志：
    山西潞城县第五区王村是一个早已完成了土地改革的村子。但是这个村子的干部和农民们警惕性不高，总觉得土地改革完成了，天下就太平了。致使该村七户地主富农中，就有三户不好好生产，而且趁机进行倒算。地主王振福是一个天主教徒，他为了达到倒算的目的，经常向农民说：“上帝有眼，善有善报，恶有恶报；现在未报，时刻未到。”当有一部分农民受了他的欺骗宣传，向他靠近以后；他就进一步散布谣言说：“将来的天下是天主教的天下。”思想模糊的农民们听了都很恐慌。分得王振福的土地、房屋及砖瓦等的三户农民，吓的把这些已分得的东西又暗暗地退给了王振福。最近县人民政府才发觉了这件事，除了将这些倒算财产仍退给农民以外，并且给予这些倒算地主以严厉处分。
