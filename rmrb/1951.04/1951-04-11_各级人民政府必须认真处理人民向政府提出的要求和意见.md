All levels of People's Governments must conscientiously handle the requests and opinions raised by the people to the government
    "All levels of People's Governments and consultative committees must establish specialized and capable organs to properly handle every request made by the people to the government, answer the people's letters, and receive the people in a convenient manner. In this way, all levels of People's Governments can closely connect with the people and genuinely serve the people, and the broad masses of the people can manage their own affairs and the affairs of the country through the people's representative conferences and People's Governments at all levels."
　  Excerpt from Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's speech at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing Municipality

　　各级人民政府必须认真处理人民向政府提出的要求和意见
    “各级人民政府和协商委员会要建立专门的有能力的机关来适当处理每个人民向政府所提出的要求，答复人民的来信，并用方便的办法接见人民。这样，使各级人民政府密切地联系人民，切实地为人民服务，而广大的人民也就可以经过各级人民代表会议和人民政府来管理自己的事务和国家的事务。”
