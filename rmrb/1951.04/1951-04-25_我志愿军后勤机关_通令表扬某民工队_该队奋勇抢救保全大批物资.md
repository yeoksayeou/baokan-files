    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd] The Logistics Organ of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army issued a circular of commendation for a certain volunteer labor team that bravely rescued and preserved supplies. On March 9th, when a volunteer labor battalion was carrying out a mission in a certain area, enemy aircraft dropped a large number of time bombs, which landed near 117 barrels of gasoline and four train cars of fat pigs (a total of 1,085 heads) and other supplies. The situation was extremely critical. The person in charge of the supply station and the cadres of the volunteer labor team recognized the importance of preserving these supplies for the supply of the front line. With a high sense of responsibility, they calmly studied ways to risk a rescue. Immediately, Battalion Commander Liu Lilin, Political Instructor Liu Dexi, and Wen Rui, Hou Qiwu, and Company Commander Yu Quanyi, personally led 119 laborers and two nurses to bravely carry out the rescue. Because of their calmness, resourcefulness, quick action, and mastery of the detonation patterns of time bombs, they crawled and lay down between successive explosions, and finally rescued all the supplies safely, without a single person injured. The Volunteer Army Logistics Organ deeply praised the spirit of the battalion personnel in cherishing the people's property, rescuing supplies, and bravely taking responsibility for supplying the front line, and issued a special circular of commendation, calling on all logistics personnel to learn from them.

　  该队奋勇抢救保全大批物资
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】中国人民志愿军后勤机关通令表扬奋勇抢救、保全物资的某志愿民工队。三月九日，志愿民工某大队在某地执行任务时，敌机投下大量定时炸弹，正落在一百一十七桶汽油和四个车皮的肥猪（共一千零八十五头）等物资的附近。当时情形十分危急，兵站负责人和志愿民工队的干部们认识了保全这些物资对于供应前线的重要性，即以高度的责任心，沉着地研究了冒险抢救的办法。随即，该队大队长刘立林、政治教导员刘德喜、和文瑞、侯齐武和中队长于全义等，亲自带领一百一十九名民工队员，与两名护士，奋勇施行抢救。由于他们沉着机智、行动迅速，并掌握了定时炸弹的爆炸规律，在炸弹相继爆发之间，爬起卧倒，终于将全部物资安全救出，并无一人受伤。志愿军后勤机关对该大队人员此种爱护人民财产、抢救物资供应前线的奋勇负责精神，深为称赞，特通令表扬，号召全体后勤人员向他们学习。
