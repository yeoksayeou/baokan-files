　　Beijing Municipal Secondary School Teachers, Students, and Staff
    Write to Mayor Peng Zhen Guaranteeing
    Assistance to the Government in Purging Counter-Revolutionaries
    [Our Newspaper] Teachers, students, and staff of various secondary schools in Beijing have written letters to Mayor Peng Zhen, unanimously supporting the people's government's measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and guaranteeing to assist the government in purging all counter-revolutionary elements hidden in the people's capital.
    In their letters to Mayor Peng Zhen, various schools all considered the people's government's execution of counter-revolutionary criminals a cause for great satisfaction, something they had long hoped the government would do. The teachers and students of Municipal No. 5 Middle School wrote in their letter: "Remembering the past under the rule of the Kuomintang, when secret agents ran rampant, with 'red hats' and 'blacklists' flying everywhere, 'disappearances' and beatings threatened each of us, making it impossible for us teachers to teach with peace of mind, and making it impossible for our students to study with peace of mind, making our schools not schools. We can never forget those dark and terrifying days, and those criminals who owed us countless blood debts. We have been waiting for the day of final reckoning. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, this day of great satisfaction has finally arrived, and blood debts will finally be repaid with blood." The teachers, students, and staff of Hebei Province Beijing Senior High School also wrote: "When all of our teachers, students, and staff saw the news that the government had executed Chen Zidan, the Central Bureau of Statistics secret agent who created the 'April 17th' blood case in our school, we all applauded and cheered 'Long Live!' Each of us felt an indescribable excitement and love for the government from the bottom of our hearts. We thank the government for avenging our victimized students and eliminating harm for the people of the whole country." The students of Hebei Province Beijing Normal School believe that: "The Municipal Government's implementation of the 'Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries' will create the most peaceful learning environment for us."
    The teachers, students, and staff of various schools all expressed in their letters to Mayor Peng their intention to assist the people's government in resolutely and thoroughly purging all counter-revolutionary elements lurking in the people's capital. The students of Hebei Province Beijing Normal School said in their letter: "First of all, we guarantee to you: we will always be vigilant and do a good job in propaganda. Secondly, we also guarantee to you: if we find counter-revolutionary elements in our homes or among our relatives and friends, we will definitely report them. We are determined to assist the government in purging counter-revolutionary elements! Because the Municipal People's Government's resolute suppression of counter-revolutionary elements has consolidated the revolutionary order of the capital, ensuring the safety of our lives and learning environment. We will definitely respond to your call with practical actions to express our gratitude to you." The letter from Beijing Municipal No. 5 Middle School wrote: "All of our teachers and students will support the government with all our strength and bring back to justice all fugitive criminals, no matter where they flee to." Hongda Middle School also made a guarantee to Mayor Peng, writing: "From now on, we will definitely cooperate with the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries with practical actions." All the teachers, students, and staff of Hebei Province Beijing Senior High School also guaranteed to "maintain vigilance at all times and assist the government in resolutely and thoroughly purging all counter-revolutionary elements lurking in the people's capital."

    各校的师生员工给彭市长的信中，都表示要协助人民政府，把潜伏在人民首都的一切反革命分子，坚决彻底肃清。河北省北京师范学校同学们的信中说：“我们首先向您保证：我们一定随时提高警惕，作好宣传工作。其次我们还向您保证：无论在我们家里，或亲戚朋友中，如发现反革命分子，我们一定检举。我们决心协助政府肃清反革命分子！因为市人民政府这样坚决地镇压反革命分子，巩固了首都的革命秩序，使我们每个人的生命和学习环境，都有了保障，我们一定以实际行动来响应您的号召，以表示我们对您的感激。”北京市立五中的信中写道：“我们全体师生将以全力来支援政府，将一切潜逃的罪犯，不管他们逃到天涯海角，也要抓回来法办。”弘达中学也向彭市长提出了保证，他们写道：“今后我们一定用实际行动来配合政府镇压反革命。”河北省北京高级中学的全校师生员工也保证要“时时提高警惕，协助政府，把潜伏在人民首都的一切反革命分子坚决彻底肃清。”
