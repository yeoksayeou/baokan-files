Xinhua News Agency, April 27th: IUS President Grohman delivered a report on "Student Movements in Colonies and Dependent Countries and the Tasks of the International Union of Students" at the Executive Committee meeting held in Beijing on the 26th. The summary is as follows:

    The IUS Charter stipulates that aiding the struggle of students and people in colonies and dependent countries for freedom is one of its main tasks. Today, wars of aggression against the people of Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya have been launched. The United States is the main stronghold of colonialism in the world. Under US control, Japan has become a war base in the Pacific, threatening the independence of the Asian people like Japanese imperialism did years ago. However, today the struggle of the people in colonies and dependent countries for independence has reached a new stage. The Chinese people have achieved a historic victory. The colonial people are uniting closely to fight for liberation. Students are active participants in this struggle.

    Colonialism and imperialism are the enemies of all mankind, and the most serious threat to people and youth who aspire to peace, independence, and the right to study for constructive work. Two-fifths of the world's population live under colonial conditions, which is the most shameful chapter in human history. For centuries, colonialists have sent troops to distant countries to occupy territories, massacre people, develop resources to supply the industries of the colonizers, force the colonial people to engage in slave labor, and turn the blood and sweat of the people into the skyscrapers and luxurious villas of the colonizers.

    Colonialism is the enemy of education. In Vietnam, after 80 years of French rule, the illiteracy rate is 85%; in Malaya, after 130 years of British rule, the illiteracy rate is 93.6%; in India, the illiteracy rate is 85%, in Iran it is 80%, and in the non-liberated areas of Burma it is 63%. In Latin America, Brazil has an illiteracy rate of 70%, and Cuba has 60%. Colonial education discriminates against the colonial people. In Algeria, 90% of the residents are locals, but only 9% of the students are locals. Women also suffer discrimination. Only 3% of girls in Tunisia receive primary education. In colonies where education is available in some form, the cost of education prevents the children of workers and peasants from attending school. The cost of higher education in Malaya averages 150 Malayan dollars per day, while the average wage of workers is only 3 dollars per day. School facilities are extremely poor, and epidemics are rampant. According to official materials published in February 1951, only 59% of school children in Bombay, India, receive annual physical examinations. They suffer from 600,977 diseases, and there is only one doctor and five assistants to treat them. Only 5% of these children receive medical treatment. The reason for such backwardness in colonies and dependent countries can be seen from the following fact: in 1946, a single colonial company—the United Africa Company—earned 25 million pounds. According to materials from the British government's Colonial Office, this amount is equivalent to the total amount of funds allocated by Britain in the nine years from 1940 to 1949 for the economic, health, education, social affairs, and welfare development of 47 colonies with 68 million residents.

    Colonialism is the persecutor of national culture and science. In colonies and dependent countries, national culture and history are banned. The younger generation is educated to be ignorant of and disgusted with the achievements of their own nation, and to worship the "achievements" of the colonizers. The main weapon of this policy is the suppression of national languages. In colonial education, history is distorted by teaching the history of the colonizers and the suzerain states. Children in French colonies read lessons that say their ancestors were Gauls. Colonial children learn the geography of the suzerain state, not their own. They must memorize the names of the kings of the suzerain state, while their own national leaders are considered "traitors." National educational institutions are often banned, and the schools that exist are branches of universities in the suzerain state. The credits offered by these branches are lower than those of the original schools in the suzerain state, so students cannot receive higher education. Colonial education is used as a tool to train administrative personnel for the colonial regime. The teaching of technology and science is hindered. If there is science education, it is abstract, without touching on scientific problems or taking into account national needs. In Kuomintang-ruled China, although the Yellow River often floods, students studying engineering often studied the Mississippi River instead of the Yellow River. When French President Auriol spoke in Algeria in May 1949, he said: "Diplomas are necessary, but not too many." The colonizers have always adhered to this principle.

    A consistent characteristic of colonialism is the persecution and suppression of democratic rights and freedoms. For centuries, prisons have been filled with patriots and defenders of the people's interests. Students are often subjected to armed suppression, imprisoned, or sentenced to death. Vietnamese students who demonstrated against the presence of American warships in Saigon were massacred by the police. Student organizations that defend national independence and strive to improve educational conditions are banned. In India, Malaya, and the Middle East, the closure of universities and schools has become a means of persecuting students.

    The tragic situation of the colonial people has been further exacerbated by the intensification of imperialist war preparations. Imperialists use military and economic treaties to bring colonies and dependent countries under their control, and the people are successively dragged into war plans. In areas where people are actively resisting, colonial wars are launched. The United States controls military bases in Africa, intensifies its interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries, and is waging the most brutal war in history in Korea. Months after the outbreak of the Korean War, US President Truman said: "Asia is the base of our industrial society." General Roberts, who was sent by the US government to train the South Korean army, said in 1950: "Sending white people to fight in Asia is only a last resort. We can use indigenous troops at the lowest cost, giving them five dollars a month and a bowl of rice a day. No rice if no fighting." All this clearly exposes the imperialists' attempt to enslave the people of colonies and dependent countries.

    The colonial system has become a great threat to world peace. In recent years, as a result of the intensification of imperialist war preparations and the waging of colonial wars, the already devastated education situation in the colonies has deteriorated further. For example, in 1948, the Moroccan government spent 4 million yuan to repair a military port, while the education budget was only 40,000 yuan. War preparations are rapidly endangering education in the suzerain states. As soon as the Korean War began, the US education budget was immediately cut. Tuition fees for higher education in the United States have increased by 50% in recent years, and the number of students is decreasing. The 600 billion francs that the French government used for the Vietnam War would have been enough to establish a school in every village, a maternity hospital in every district, and a large hospital in every county. The youth of these countries are being sent to fight. Therefore, the colonial system is the enemy of all youth. Only in the context of friendly cooperation between independent countries can the youth of these countries obtain brilliantly developing education and a bright future.

    In countries that have gained independence, education is developing brilliantly. The Asian republics of the Soviet Union have universally established higher education institutions. More than 100 ethnic groups study in their own languages. The Mongolian People's Republic has eliminated illiteracy. Education in the People's Republic of China has made great progress. In colonial countries engaged in arduous struggles for liberation, education has also made great achievements.

    The struggle of the people in colonies and dependent countries for independence and peace has entered a new stage in recent years. Students from various countries have actively participated in this struggle. The Chinese student movement is the most prominent example, demonstrating the contribution of students to the struggle for independence. Chinese students have gained rich experience in launching united action and meeting student demands, such as the student self-help movement, which enables students to be self-sufficient in food and clothing and continue their studies, thereby fully developing participation in the struggle for independence. Today, the struggle of the people in colonies and dependent countries for peace is inseparable from the struggle for independence. The participation of students in these countries in the peace movement has greatly strengthened the solidarity of the broad masses of students. When foreign troops invade their homeland, the people bravely stand up to defend their homeland, and students consistently fight alongside the people. Large numbers of Vietnamese students have joined the People's Army, and the youth and students of Malaya have widely responded to the call to defend their homeland. Korean students have become major contributors to the student struggle for peace. They occupy an important position in the struggle to defend their homeland. Their struggle is an outstanding contribution to world peace and the struggle of people around the world for independence. Students around the world have expressed their solidarity with the youth and students of Korea. This solidarity proves that students around the world oppose wars of aggression and attempts to conquer the people of other countries.

    The actions of students in colonies and dependent countries to improve educational and social conditions are a fundamental component of the struggle for democratic education. In many countries, students have won victories in the struggle to defend student rights, strive for teaching in their own national languages, and improve living conditions. The cooperation between students, workers, and peasants makes a great contribution to protecting the interests of all the people. A necessary condition for the success of the student struggle is broad and strong unity. Powerful organizations have emerged from the student struggle. In China, students formed powerful student organizations in the struggle against the Kuomintang. United action and organization include the majority of students who are fighting to safeguard their basic rights. Students can only achieve victory by linking their struggle with the struggle of youth and the people.

    Since its establishment, the International Union of Students has actively supported and brought the support of students around the world to the struggle of colonial students. The International Union of Students has raised the issue of the struggle of the people of various countries for national independence and the activities of colonial students to students from various countries, and has proposed specific programs to help and support colonial students. The Southeast Asian Youth and Student Conference held by the International Union of Students and the World Federation of Democratic Youth in India in 1948 strengthened the work of the International Union of Students in the field of national independence and the solidarity between youth and students from various countries and colonial youth and students. Since 1948, students around the world have held "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism" every year on February 21, publicizing the struggle of colonial students and holding fundraising events for students in colonies and dependent countries. The International Union of Students and student organizations in various countries have organized many solidarity movements for the struggle of colonial students, launched international movements to protect persecuted students in colonies and dependent countries, and provided assistance to colonial students in education and medicine. Through the International Union of Students, the rich experience of the international student movement has been disseminated to colonial students, enabling them to closely integrate their movement with the student movements of other countries. Through these actions, students in colonies and dependent countries have gained increasing support from students around the world, and the groups of students in various countries in the struggle against colonialism have been greatly strengthened. In the United States, numerous students and their organizations have recognized the right of people of all countries to obtain independence and urged an end to the war in Korea. Youth and students in the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries provide a large amount of material assistance to youth and students in colonies and dependent countries and raise funds to ensure their participation in international activities. All this clearly shows that the vast majority of students in the world oppose colonialism and oppose the policy of world hegemony. They can make an increasing contribution to the cause of striving for peace and for the independence of people of all countries.

    Colonial rulers use many absurd arguments to prevent the struggle of the colonial people. They insist that the colonial system has served the "welfare" of the colonial people. However, the current colonial wars undoubtedly expose the true purpose of the colonial rulers' so-called promotion of "civilization." Some student leaders have an argument that opposing colonialism and wars of aggression is a political action, and participating in political activities will undermine student unity. The purpose of this argument is to undermine the unity of students in the struggle against colonialism and wars of aggression. The colonial system and the enslavement of other people are facts that exist now. Saying that opposing it is a political activity and not opposing it does not escape politics, but on the contrary, is a political act of supporting the colonial system and wars of aggression. Colonialists use these words to threaten the people, in other words, if the people take action to fight for independence, the colonizers will suppress them. The situation of students in colonies and dependent countries clearly shows that political action is a necessary part of defending student interests. To eliminate the terrible life in the colonies, it is necessary to eradicate the colonial system and colonial wars. Only by actively grasping these issues can student unity be achieved.

    The International Union of Students actively supports the struggle of colonial students for national independence and a better life. Colonial students have fully participated in the formulation of the policies of the International Union of Students, and they will decide on the policies they follow.

    Regarding the further tasks of the International Union of Students and student organizations in the struggle of students in colonies and dependent countries, the International Union of Students calls on students in colonies and dependent countries to further intensify the struggle for national independence and strengthen unity, and suggests that they strengthen the following work: strive for universal education, strive for national and democratic education, teach in national languages, teach national history, promote national culture, oppose foreign control of national education, strive for freedom of speech, publication, and association, and develop various self-help activities.

    The World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace to be held in Berlin is an outstanding international activity for world youth to strive for peace. The International Union of Students calls on all students in colonies and dependent countries to regard participating in this festival as a most important task and to elect a larger number of representative delegations to participate.

    The International Union of Students calls on students in suzerain states and Western countries to regard ending colonial wars and other wars of aggression as part of their struggle to protect student rights; American students must strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and stop the government from interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and demand immediate recognition of the right of colonial nations to self-determination; provide material assistance to colonial students.

    The International Union of Students must launch an international student movement in support of convening a conference of the five major powers to conclude a peace treaty; widely publicize the resolution of the World Peace Council on the struggle of colonies and dependent countries for peace; support the movement demanding a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and opposing the rearmament of Japan; support the struggle against the transfer of military bases, the conclusion of military agreements, and conscription for foreign military activities; publicize the struggle of students in colonies and dependent countries to students around the world, urge them to oppose colonialism and interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and propose specific methods for joint action with these student organizations; support student relief activities in various countries, and launch an active relief movement for Korean students; establish broader contacts between students in colonies and dependent countries and students in other countries, and consider sending student delegations to visit these countries; and assist delegations of students from colonies and dependent countries to participate in international activities.

    The struggle of the people in colonies and dependent countries has brought the end of the colonial system closer, and has opened up a great future for them to move towards peace and independence. The struggle of students in these countries for universal and democratic education, and their efforts with their people for independence and peace, are an increasing contribution to the elimination of the colonial system.

　　殖民地与附属国的学生运动及国际学联的任务
　  国际学联主席格罗曼在二十六日执委会议上报告的摘要
    【新华社二十七日讯】国际学生联合会执行委员会主席格罗曼，于二十六日在北京举行的执委会议上发表关于《殖民地与附属国的学生运动及国际学联的任务》的报告，摘要如下：
    国际学联会章规定援助殖民地及附属国学生及人民争取自由的斗争为主要任务之一。今天，侵略朝鲜、越南和马来亚人民的战争已经发动了。美国是全世界殖民主义的主要堡垒，在美国控制下日本已变为太平洋中的战争基地，像日本帝国主义数年前那样威胁亚洲人民的独立。但是，今天殖民地与附属国人民争取独立的斗争已经到了一个新的阶段。中国人民已取得了历史性胜利。殖民地人民正紧密团结起来争取解放。学生是这一斗争的积极参加者。
    殖民主义和帝国主义是全人类的仇敌，对于期望和平、独立以及建设性工作学习的权利的人民和青年是最严重的威胁。全世界有五分之二的居民在殖民地的条件下生活，这是人类历史上最可耻的一章。几世纪以来殖民者派遣军队去到辽远的国家占领领土，残杀人民，开发富源来供应殖民者的工业，强迫殖民地人民进行奴隶劳动，把人民的血汗变成了殖民者的摩天楼和富丽的别墅。
    殖民主义是教育的敌人。越南在法国八十年的统治下，文盲有百分之八十五；马来亚在英国一百三十年的统治下，文盲有百分之九十三点六；印度的文盲占百分之八十五，伊朗占百分之八十，缅甸的非解放区有百分之六十三。在拉丁美洲，巴西有文盲百分之七十，古巴有百分之六十。殖民教育歧视殖民地人民，阿尔及利亚居民中有百分之九十是本地人，而学生中只有百分之九是本地人。妇女也遭受歧视，突尼西亚的女孩子只有百分之三受到初等教育。在教育条件还具备某些形式的殖民地，教育费用也使工农子弟不能入学。马来亚高等学校的费用平均每日马来币一百五十元，而工人的平均工资每日却只有三元。学校设备极坏，疫病猖獗。据一九五一年二月官方发表的材料，印度孟买的入学儿童只有百分之五十九每年检查身体，他们患有六十万零九百七十七种疾病，只有一个医生五个助手医病，这些儿童只有百分之五得到医疗。殖民地和附属国如此落后的原因，可从下列事实看出：在一九四六年，单是一个殖民地的联合公司——非洲联合公司就赚了二千五百万镑，根据英国政府殖民部的材料，这个数目相当于英国在一九四○到一九四九年的九年中拨供四十七个殖民地六千八百万居民发展经济、卫生、教育、社会事业和福利的款项的总数。
    殖民主义是民族文化和科学的迫害者。在殖民地和附属国中，民族文化和历史被取缔。年青一代所受的教养，是灌输他们对自己民族成就的无知与憎恶，对殖民者的“成就”的崇拜。这个政策的主要武器是取缔民族语文。在殖民地教育中，因为用殖民者和宗主国的历史教学，历史受到歪曲。法国殖民地的儿童念的课文中说他们的祖先是高卢人。殖民地儿童学习宗主国的地理，不学本国的。他们必须背诵宗主国历代国王的姓氏，而本国的民族领袖被认为是“叛徒”。民族教育机构常遭禁止，存在的学校都是宗主国大学的分校，这些分校所设的学分比宗主国原校为低，因此学生不能受到高等教育。殖民地教育被用为训练殖民政权行政人员的工具。技术和科学的教学受到留难。如果有科学教育也是抽象的，既没有接触到科学问题，也没有照顾到国家需要。在国民党统治的中国，虽然黄河时常泛滥，但学工程的学生研究的往往是密西西比河而不是黄河。一九四九年五月法国总统阿里奥尔在阿尔及利亚演说时称：“文凭是需要的，但不要太多。”殖民者原是一贯奉行这个原则的。
    殖民主义的一贯特色是迫害及取缔民主权利和自由。几世纪以来，监牢中塞满了爱国者和人民利益的保卫者。学生时常遭到武装镇压，被监禁或判死刑。反对美国军舰出现在西贡而举行示威的越南学生遭到警察屠杀。保卫民族独立、争取改善教育条件的学生组织遭到禁止。在印度、马来亚及中东各国，封闭大学和学校成为对学生迫害的手段。
    殖民地人民的悲惨境遇因为帝国主义加紧备战而更加恶化了。帝国主义者借军事、经济的条约把殖民地和附属国置于控制之下，人民相继被拖入战争计划之中。在人民进行积极抵抗的地区，就发动了殖民战争。美国控制了非洲的军事基地，加紧干涉中东国家的内政，在朝鲜进行着历史上最残酷的战争。朝鲜战争发生后数月，美国总统杜鲁门说：“亚洲是我们工业社会的基地”。美国政府派去训练南朝鲜军队的罗伯茨准将在一九五○年说：“把白人送到亚洲作战只是最后的手段，我们可以最低的代价利用土著军队，给他们每月五块钱每天一碗饭就行了。不打仗就不给饭吃。”这一切都明显暴露了帝国主义者要使殖民地和附属国人民沦为奴隶的企图。
    殖民制度已成为世界和平的极大的威胁。最近几年由于帝国主义加紧备战和进行殖民战争的结果，殖民地原来就备受摧残的教育情形更加恶化了。例如摩洛哥政府在一九四八年用四百万元修军港，而教育费只有四万元。战争准备正迅速地危害着宗主国内的教育。朝鲜战争一开始，美国的教育经费马上被削减。美国高等教育的学费近年来已增加了百分之五十，学生在减少。法国政府用于越南战争的六千亿法郎，足够在每个乡村设一所学校，在每个区设一所产科医院，在每个县设一所大医院之用。这些国家的青年正被送去打仗。因此，殖民制度是全体青年的敌人。只有在独立的国家建立友好合作关系的情况下，这些国家的青年才能得到灿烂发展的教育和美好的将来。
    在获得独立的国家里教育在灿烂发展着。苏联的亚洲各加盟共和国已普遍设立了高等教育机构。一百个以上的民族都以自己的语文来学习。蒙古人民共和国已扫除了文盲。中华人民共和国的教育有了极大的进展。在进行着艰苦解放斗争的殖民地国家，教育也获得了大的成就。
    殖民地附属国的人民争取独立与和平的斗争近年来已进入新的阶段。各国学生们一直积极参加这个斗争。中国的学生运动是最显著的例子，表明了学生对独立斗争的贡献。中国学生在展开一致行动和满足学生要求的斗争中取得了丰富经验，例如学生自助运动，使学生衣食自给并继续求学，从而充分发展了参加争取独立的斗争。今天，殖民地与附属国人民争取和平的斗争已和争取独立不可分。这些国家的学生参加了和平运动，已大大加强了广大学生的团结。在外国军队侵略他们的祖国的时候，人民英勇地站起来保卫祖国，学生一贯地和人民并肩作战。越南学生大批地参加了人民军，马来亚的青年和学生广泛的响应了保卫祖国的号召。朝鲜学生已成为学生争取和平斗争的主要贡献者，他们在保卫祖国的斗争中占着重要地位，他们的斗争对世界和平和全世界人民争取独立的斗争是一个卓越的贡献。全世界学生都表示声援朝鲜的青年和学生。这种声援证明了全世界学生反对侵略战争，反对征服其他国家人民的图谋。
    殖民地附属国学生争取改善教育和社会条件的行动是争取民主教育斗争的基本组成部分。在许多国家，学生在保卫学生权利、争取用本民族语言教学、改善生活条件的斗争中获得胜利。学生和工人、农民的合作对保卫全体人民的利益有很大贡献。学生的斗争成功的必要条件是广泛坚强的团结。学生在斗争中曾经产生了强大的组织。在中国，学生在反对国民党的斗争中就形成了强大的学生组织。团结的行动和组织把为保障他们的基本权利而斗争的大多数学生包括进去。学生们只有把他们的斗争与青年和人民的斗争联系起来，才能取得胜利。
    国际学联自成立以来，就积极支持并把全世界学生的支持带给殖民地学生的斗争。国际学联向各国学生提出了各国人民争取民族独立和殖民地学生活动的问题，并提出了帮助与声援殖民地学生的具体纲领。一九四八年国际学联和世界青联在印度举行的东南亚青年和学生大会，加强了国际学联在民族独立方面的工作，和各国青年学生与殖民地青年学生之间的团结。全世界学生自一九四八年以来每年在二月二十一日举行“反对殖民制度斗争日”，宣传殖民地学生的斗争并为殖民地附属国的学生举行募捐。国际学联及各国学生团体已为殖民地学生的斗争组织了许多声援运动，发起了保卫殖民地附属国受迫害学生的国际运动，并在教育与医药等方面援助殖民地学生。通过国际学联，国际学生运动的丰富经验已传播到殖民地学生中间，并使他们能够把他们的运动与其他国家的学生运动密切结合起来。通过这些行动，殖民地附属国的学生获得了世界各地学生日益增加的支持，而且各国学生在反对殖民制度的斗争中的团体已大大的加强了。在美国，众多的学生及其组织已经确认了各国人民获取独立的权利，并敦促停止在朝鲜的战争。苏联及人民民主国家的青年学生给殖民地附属国的青年学生以大量的物质援助，并募集基金保证他们参加国际活动。所有这一切都非常明显地表明：世界各国绝大多数的学生是反对殖民制度、反对称霸世界的政策的。他们在争取和平、争取各国人民独立的事业中是可以作出越来越大的贡献的。
    殖民地统治者用许多荒谬的论调来阻止殖民地人民的斗争。他们硬说殖民地制度曾经为殖民地人民谋过“福利”。但是目前进行的殖民战争无疑地暴露了殖民地统治者所谓宣扬“文明”的真正目的。有些学生领袖有一种论调说反对殖民制度与侵略战争是政治行动，参加政治活动就会破坏学生的团结。这种论调的目的是要破坏学生在反对殖民制度与侵略战争的斗争中的团结。殖民制度与奴役其他人民是现在存在的事实，说反对它是政治活动而不去反对它，那就不能逃避政治而相反地正是支持殖民制度与侵略战争的政治行为。殖民主义者用这种话来威胁人民，换句话说就是如果人民以行动争取独立，殖民者就要加以镇压。殖民地和附属国学生的情况清晰地说明政治行动是保卫学生利益的一个必要的部分。要消除殖民地的可怕的生活就要根绝殖民制度、殖民战争。只有积极地抓紧这些问题，才能达到学生的团结统一。
    国际学联积极支持殖民地学生争取民族独立与美好生活的斗争。殖民地学生曾全力参加了国际学联政策的制订，他们将要决定自己遵循的政策。
    关于国际学联与学生组织在殖民地与附属国学生的斗争中的进一步的任务，国际学联号召殖民地附属国的学生进一步加紧争取国家独立的斗争和加强团结，并建议他们加强进行下列的工作：争取普遍教育，争取民族与民主的教育，用本民族语文教学，讲授本民族历史，发扬本民族文化，反对外国控制本民族教育事业，争取言论、出版、结社的自由，发展各种自助活动。
    将在柏林举行的世界青年学生和平联欢节，是世界青年争取和平的一个卓越的国际活动。国际学联号召所有殖民地和附属国的学生们把参加这个联欢节看作一个最重要的任务，选出人数较多的富于代表性的代表团参加。
    国际学联号召宗主国及西方国家的学生，把结束殖民战争及其他侵略战争看作他们保障学生权利的斗争的一部分；美国学生必须争取和平解决朝鲜问题并制止政府干涉其他国家的内政，要求立即承认殖民地民族自决权；给殖民地学生以物质上的援助。
    国际学联必须展开拥护召开五大国缔结和平公约会议的国际学生运动；广泛宣传世界和平理事会关于殖民地与附属国争取和平斗争的决议；支持要求和平解决朝鲜问题、反对重新武装日本的运动；支持反对让渡军事基地、订立军事协定及为了外国军事活动而实行征兵的斗争；向全世界学生宣传殖民地附属国学生的斗争，敦促他们反对殖民制度和干涉其他国家的内政，并提出与这些学生组织共同行动的具体方法；支持各国学生的救济活动，发起一个对朝鲜学生的积极救济运动；在殖民地附属国及其他国家学生之间建立更广泛的联系，并考虑派遣学生代表团访问这些国家；帮助殖民地附属国家学生的代表团参加国际活动。
    殖民地附属国人民的斗争已经使殖民制度的末日临近，并且已为他们自己打开了走向和平与独立的伟大前途。这些国家的学生为普遍和民主的教育而进行的斗争，以及与他们的人民一道为独立与和平而进行的努力，对于消灭殖民制度是一个与日俱增的贡献。
