US and British Troops on the Korean Battlefield
By Our Correspondent Tan Wenrui

I. Desperate American Troops
The American troops invading Korea, having suffered successive devastating blows from the Chinese and Korean People's forces, generally exhibit a sense of desperation due to the recognition of the invincible power of the Chinese and Korean People's forces. Consequently, the already low morale of the American invading forces has become even more demoralized and depressed, plunging them into a state of constant anxiety.

Almost every American soldier on the Korean battlefield refers to the Korean War as a "damn war." The soldiers' resentment towards MacArthur is increasing daily. Private Krizin of Company A, 9th Regiment, 2nd Division, said, "If MacArthur came to the Korean battlefield to experience this taste, he might not continue fighting." Desertion, feigning illness, and self-mutilation are becoming increasingly common. A prisoner of the 8th Company, 1st Battalion, 19th Regiment, 24th Division, named Felixay, said that among the acquaintances he knew in his company, two shot themselves in the palm with a pistol, and one deserted. These people were all arrested and sent back to the United States, but they were very happy, even if they were to be sentenced to several years in prison. Private Long Jin of the 25th Division wrote to his brother in a letter before he was captured, "I have only fired seven shots in total, and I hope this is all I will ever have to fire."

The prisoners who had been released by the Chinese People's Volunteers were envied by the American soldiers, because these people were sent back to the United States and did not have to fight in Korea anymore. Many people who had never thought of surrendering secretly kept the "Surrender Call" we distributed in their wallets for future use. Private Fulcheng of the 8th Company, 2nd Battalion, 35th Regiment, 25th Division, said without any embarrassment, "I had planned to surrender a long time ago, but I didn't get the chance until now." He also said, "Here you don't have to fight anymore, and you won't lose your life."

American soldiers are known for their cowardice, and they are even more frightened in the face of the Chinese People's Volunteers. One prisoner told me, "I am afraid of nothing but death." Fear of death is admitted frankly by many American prisoners. Many American soldiers believe that it is not worth losing their lives in such a war. Because they are afraid of death, they are superstitious. Here I found that nine out of ten prisoners had a pocket-sized Bible in their pockets, believing that God could protect them from being killed. A legend is circulating in the U.S. military: during World War I, a soldier put a Bible in his left pocket, and it blocked a bullet, saving his life. In addition, a handwritten "amulet" is also widely circulated among American soldiers, full of nonsensical spells: "…Whoever wears this amulet will not be injured by enemy guns, God will give him divine power, not afraid of robbers and murderers, not afraid of knives, guns and swords, so that the wearer of this charm can avoid all dangers. Whoever wears this amulet will not be injured or captured by the enemy. Amen…" The Americans, who claim to be enlightened by science, can only rely on this kind of trickery to seek comfort in despair. The so-called chaplains (actually disguised secret agents) constantly try to encourage the soldiers with the preaching that "if you die in battle, God will let you into heaven," but their followers retort, "Heaven is not as good as the world, and there is not necessarily whiskey there."

What makes millions of Korean people homeless, the American invading army does not forget their own families. The war of aggression has dragged on for so long, and failed so miserably, that homesickness is as prevalent among the American invading army as an epidemic. In the family letters of these invaders, it is difficult to find a letter that encourages these "expeditionaries" to fight bravely. Wives urge their husbands to find ways to return home as soon as possible; mothers urge their sons not to go forward when fighting, and not to be afraid of being called cowards…; fathers blame their sons for not listening to advice and enlisting rashly; lovers warn their partners that if they do not return, they will marry someone else. The soldiers of the invading army in fear and despair receive such family letters, which make the anti-war sentiment in the invading army deeper and more widespread.

I asked Captain Delisle of the 17th Regiment, 24th Division of the U.S. Army, if they, as officers, knew that morale was so low, had they ever thought of any way to encourage their subordinates? He sighed, "What can we do? The morale of our officers is not low either?" Another U.S. Army captain, Urdanno, of the 2nd Division, said in a letter to his wife, "I have been in the army for thirteen years, and I will be able to get a pension in a few years, but I don't want to do it anymore."

The main factor that makes the morale of the U.S. military officers and soldiers is low is not other things, but the bravery of our soldiers. A U.S. veteran Pikara, who had been in the army for ten years and fought many battles, a corporal of the 7th Company, 2nd Battalion, 35th Regiment, 25th Division, said, "I have never fought such a terrible battle." I have not met a U.S. prisoner who said he believed that the U.S. invading army could win this war.

The American invading army on the Korean battlefield is already a desperate army.

II. The Resentment of British Soldiers
During the New Year Offensive, a unit of our People's Volunteer Army annihilated units of the "Royal Rifle Regiment" of the 29th British Brigade and other units in the northwest of Seoul and captured many prisoners. Almost none of the captured British soldiers did not curse and complain about being "tricked by the Americans." They knew that their task of holding the valley southeast of Goyang County, northwest of Seoul, was to protect the flanks of the U.S. 25th Division, which was preparing to retreat towards Seoul on the highway. However, those American troops suffering from "panic sickness" fled in a panic as soon as they encountered our volunteer chasing troops (as a result, one battalion still did not escape), leaving their "allies" in that valley, called "Death Valley" by the British prisoners, to be severely defeated by the Chinese People's Volunteers. Staff Sergeant Cox of the Direct Company of the British Tank Regiment said angrily, "Last time, the Turkish soldiers were the victims of the Americans, this time it is us British, and next time it should be the Filipinos or the French."

The vast majority of the 29th British Brigade were veterans who had participated in World War II, and many had retired after the war and were re-enlisted by the government between August and September last year. Years of peaceful life have made these veterans tired of military life, and some have almost forgotten how to fire a gun. However, because they did not want to go to prison, they had to bite the bullet and enter the barracks again. Keir, a soldier of the 7th Platoon, 3rd Company of the Rifle Regiment, had fought the Japanese in Burma for more than three years. He said, "At that time, I volunteered to join the army because I wanted to fight against Japanese fascism. But coming to Korea is to give my life for the benefit of the Americans. If I had not been forced by the government, I don't think any British soldiers would be willing to come." Most British soldiers do not believe that they are fighting for the "United Nations," and those who are a little clearer know that the United Nations has become a tool of aggression for American imperialism. Although a few people, because they had been deceived by the propaganda of the American and British reactionaries, did not have a correct understanding of the situation in Korea, and when they left the UK, they thought that coming to Korea was really to help the Korean people to achieve "peace" as soon as possible! But after arriving in Korea, they all understood that it was not the case at all. Taylor, a corporal of the Direct Company of the Royal Tank Regiment, said, "If the Americans hadn't made trouble, the Korean people would never have had such a disaster." An Irishman, Corporal Babur of the 3rd Platoon, 19th Company, 1st Battalion of the Rifle Regiment, said, "The Korean people want to unify themselves, what does it have to do with the Americans and the British? Just like if we North and South Irish people want to unify, no one can interfere." They hate Truman, MacArthur, and others for launching this war of aggression, and also curse the Atlee and Bevin Labour government for forcing them to come to Korea to die, they said: "You Chinese are volunteers, but we are not here voluntarily!"

British soldiers are extremely resentful of the American aircraft's barbaric massacre of the Korean people. Hollubin, a soldier of the 11th Platoon, 4th Company, 1st Battalion of the British Rifle Regiment, wrote in his diary on January 15 after being captured: "We are all very dissatisfied with the American planes bombing and strafing Korean women and children. Today we saw them bombing villages where only peaceful people live, and saw the bodies of innocent people lying in the ditches. They must stop this atrocity..." A rumor is circulating among British prisoners of war: "In the battle in the Goyang area, about 150 British soldiers were killed by the U.S. Air Force while preparing to surrender to our volunteers." They are very afraid that one day they will also die under American-made bombs.

In the eyes of these British veterans, American soldiers are all wimps who cannot fight, "although they dress well and have good weapons." Cox said: "During World War II, I fought with them, and they looked down on others, but they were extremely cowardly when they fought. There are also many American soldiers in London today, and they spend their time and energy, only know how to make money, drink, and mess with women, I can't stand it." British soldiers all say that they are unwilling to fight Koreans and Chinese. Babur raised his finger to the sky and swore, "I didn't fire a single shot in Korea, and many other soldiers ran to the mountains when they heard gunfire. The war launched by the Americans, let the Americans fight it!"

　　朝鲜战场上的美英军队
    本报记者　谭文瑞
  一、陷于绝望的美国军队
    连续遭受了中朝人民部队毁灭性打击的侵朝美军，由于认识了中朝人民部队不可战胜的强大威力，官兵们普遍呈现着绝望的情绪。因而，士气本来不高的美国侵略部队，军心就更加涣散低沉，陷于惶惶不可终日的境地中了。
    在朝鲜战场上的美国士兵，差不多每个人都把朝鲜战争称作为“该死的战争”。士兵们对麦克阿瑟的怨恨日益增加，美军第二师九团一连的下等兵克里辛说：“如果麦克阿瑟到朝鲜战场来尝尝这个滋味，他也许不会再打下去。”逃亡、装病、自残的现象愈来愈普遍，美军二十四师十九团一营八连的一个俘虏费利赛说，在他那一个连中，他所认识的熟人中就有两个用手枪打伤了自己的手掌，一个开了小差。这些人都被逮捕送回美国去了，但是他们却很高兴，即使要被判处几年徒刑。美军二十五师的一个下等兵龙金在他被俘前写给他哥哥的一封信里说：“我一共只放过七枪，我希望这是全部我所要放的了。”
    曾被中国人民志愿军释放回去的俘虏受尽美国士兵们的羡慕，因为这些人都被送回美国，不必再在朝鲜打仗了。许多从来没有想过投降的人也暗地里把我们散发的“召降书”保藏在皮夹子里备用。美军二十五师三十五团二营八连的下等兵福尔成一点也不难为情地说：“我早就有投降的打算，但一直到这回才遇上机会。”还说：“在你们这里可以不必再打仗，不会丢掉性命。”
    美国兵本来就是以怯懦出名的，在中国人民志愿军面前，他们更加丧胆了。一个俘虏向我说：“除了死，我什么都不怕。”怕死是许多美国俘虏直认不讳的。很多美国士兵认为在这样的一个战争中丧掉性命是不值得的。因为怕死，所以他们就迷信。在这里我发现十个俘虏有九个的口袋里都有一本袖珍的圣经，他们迷信上帝能保佑他们不被打死。美军中流传着一个传说：在第一次世界大战时，一个士兵把一本圣经放在左面的衣袋里，结果正挡住了一颗子弹，救了他的性命。另外还有一种手抄的“护身符”在美国士兵中也流传很广，满纸是无稽的咒语：“………不论是谁，身带此符者，将不为敌人枪炮所伤，上帝赐予他以神力，不怕劫匪与杀人犯，不怕刀枪与剑炮，使身带此符者可免一切的危险。不论是谁，身带此符者，将不会受伤或被敌人俘虏。阿门……”自命为科学昌明的美国人，在绝望之余也只能靠这种玩艺来自求安慰了。所谓随军牧师们（其实是变相的特务）不断企图以“如果你们战死，上帝将使你们进天堂”的说教来鼓舞士兵们，但是他们的教徒却回敬他们说：“天堂总没有人间好，那里不见得有威士忌。”
    使得千千万万朝鲜人民无家可归的美国侵略军却并不忘怀他们自己的家庭。侵略战争拖得那么长，而且失败得那么惨，士兵们的思乡病像疫疠一般流行在美国侵略军中。在这些侵略军的家信中，很难找到一封是鼓舞这些“出征人”英勇作战的。妻子催促丈夫设法早日回家；母亲叮嘱儿子打仗时不要往前，别怕被人说是懦夫……；父亲责怪儿子当日不听劝告冒然入伍；爱人警告爱侣再不回来，便要和旁人结婚。在恐惧绝望中的侵略军的士兵们所接到的都是这样的家信，使厌战的情绪在侵略军中更加深重普遍了。
    我问美军二十四师十七团的一个上尉德力斯莱，他们当军官的知道士气如此低落，是否曾想什么办法来鼓舞他们的部下？他叹息道：“有什么办法？我们军官的士气又何尝不低沉？”另外一个美军第二师的上尉乌尔丹诺在写给他妻子的信里说：“我在军队里已干了十三年，再熬几年养老金便可以到手，但是我怎样也不想再干下去了。”
    使美军官兵士气低沉的最主要的因素不是别的，而是我们战士们的骁勇善战。一个当了十年兵，打过多次仗的美军老兵皮卡拉，美军二十五师三十五团二营七连的一个伍长说：“我从来没有打过像这样可怕的仗。”我没有遇见过一个美军俘虏说他相信美国侵略军能打赢这个战争的。
    在朝鲜战场上的美国侵略军，已经是一支陷于绝望的军队了。
  二、英军士兵的怨恨
    在新年攻势时，我人民志愿部队某部在汉城西北地区歼灭了英军二十九旅“皇家来福枪团”等部，捉获了许多俘虏。被俘的英国士兵，几乎没有一个不咒骂和埋怨“上了美国人的当”的。他们知道他们据守汉城西北高阳郡东南地区那个山谷的任务是保护在公路上准备向汉城方面撤退的美国第二十五师的侧翼。而那些害了“吃惊病”的美军却一遇到我志愿军追击的部队，就狼狈逃遁（结果一个营还是没有跑掉），把他们的“同盟军”丢在被英军俘虏称为“死谷”的那个山谷中，使他们受到中国人民志愿军的痛歼。英军坦克团直属中队的上士柯克斯愤慨地说：“上次是土耳其兵当了美国人的牺牲品，这一回则是我们英国人，下一回该轮到菲律宾人或者法国人了。”
    英军二十九旅绝大部分是参加过第二次世界大战的老兵，许多都是战后退伍到去年八、九月间才重被政府征召服役的。多年和平生活已使这些退伍军人们厌倦行伍生涯了，有些甚至几乎已忘记了怎样开枪。但是因为他们不愿进监狱，不得不硬着头皮再进兵营。来福枪团第三连七排的士兵基尔曾在缅甸和日本人作过三年多的战。他说：“那时候我是志愿入伍的，因为我要打日本法西斯。但是到朝鲜来却是为美国人的利益送命，如果不是被政府强迫，我想没有英国士兵愿意来的。”英国士兵们大多数都不相信他们是为什么“联合国”而战，脑筋清楚一点的都知道联合国已成了美国帝国主义的侵略工具了。虽然有少数人因为曾受美英反动派的欺骗宣传，对朝鲜情势没有正确的认识，从英国出发的时候还以为到朝鲜来真的是为了帮助朝鲜人早日获得“和平”呢！但是到了朝鲜以后，都明白完全不是那么一回事。皇家坦克营直属中队的伍长泰勒说：“不是美国人捣鬼，朝鲜人民绝不会有这样的劫难。”一个爱尔兰人，来福枪团一营十九连三排的中士巴布尔说：“朝鲜人民自己愿意统一，干美国人和英国人什么事？犹如我们南北爱尔兰人若愿意统一，谁也管不着。”他们痛恨杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟之流发动这次侵略战争，同时也咒骂艾德礼、贝文的工党政府强迫他们到朝鲜来送死，他们说：“你们中国人是志愿军，我们可不是志愿来的呀！”
    英国兵对于美国飞机野蛮屠杀朝鲜人民的暴行是极为痛恨的。英军来福枪团第一营第四连十一排的士兵荷路宾在他被俘后一月十五日的日记中写道：“我们都很不满意美国飞机轰炸扫射朝鲜的妇女和儿童，今天我们亲眼看见他们轰炸只有和平人民居住的乡村，看见沟里躺着无辜者的尸体。他们必须停止这种暴行……”英军俘虏中流传着一个尚待证实的传说：“在高阳地区的战役中，有约一百五十多名的英国兵在正准备向我志愿军投降的时候被美国空军炸死。”他们很怕有一天也会死在美国制的炸弹下。
    在这些英国老兵的眼里，美国兵都是些不能打仗的孱头，“虽然他穿得讲究，拿着好的武器”。柯克斯说：“在第二次世界大战时，我和他们一块作过战的，他们瞧不起别人，打起仗来却怯懦无比。在今天的伦敦也有不少美国兵，他们花天酒地，只晓得弄钱、喝酒和搞女人，我就看不惯。”英军士兵们都说他们不愿意和朝鲜人和中国人作战。巴布尔指天发誓说：“我在朝鲜没有放过一枪，其他许多士兵听见枪响就跑到山上去了。美国人发动的战争，让美国人去打吧！”
