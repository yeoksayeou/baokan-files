Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd – According to the Korean Central News Agency: General Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, inspected the rural situation in various parts of South Pyongan Province and the spring planting work of farmers in mid-March. Farmers in various places warmly expressed to General Kim Il-sung their confidence and firm fighting spirit for the victory of the Fatherland Liberation War, and raised the issues they were most concerned about. The following are the three questions raised by the farmers and the main points of General Kim Il-sung's answers:

    Question: What is the current war situation and its prospects?

    Answer: The current war situation is favorable to us, and its future will undoubtedly end with the final victory of the Korean people.

    Nine months of war have proved that the American aggressors not only cannot conquer our motherland and people, but have also suffered a shameful defeat due to the counter-offensive of the heroic People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Today, we already have all the conditions for victory, but this does not mean waiting for victory, but rather organizing and striving for victory. The road to overcome the many difficulties in front of us is the road to strive for victory.

    In order to strive for victory, we must supply the country and the army with more grain, further strengthen support for the front, repair roads and bridges in a timely manner, not delay transportation to the front lines, stabilize our lives by means of mutual assistance and self-reliance, further consolidate our rear, and well guarantee the spring plowing and sowing in 1951.

    Question: Under the wartime conditions of insufficient manpower, animal power, and seeds, how can we ensure this year's spring sowing well?

    Answer: Undoubtedly, we are going to carry out this year's spring sowing under difficult conditions. All the young and middle-aged men have taken up arms and gone to the front to defend the independence, freedom and honor of the motherland. During their temporary occupation, the enemy slaughtered and plundered a large number of draft animals and grain seeds. Our fertilizer source for agricultural production—the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory—has been destroyed by beast-like enemies. Agricultural tools and family properties have almost all been destroyed or looted by the enemy. The rural situation makes this year's spring sowing extremely difficult. However, we must never reduce the amount of land we plant this year because of the rural situation. The front and the rear require more food, and the industrial sector requires more raw materials. "The struggle for food is the struggle for the motherland! It is the struggle to guarantee the victory of the front!" "We must attach importance to the increase in production of one grain! Don't abandon even an inch of land!" These slogans should become the battle cry of our farmers. This year's sowing is a battle. Our victory on the sowing front means victory on the front line.

    The Republic government has issued a decision on the "Work of Sowing Agricultural Products in 1951," and lent a large amount of grain and seeds to farmers who have no food or seeds, and promoted production cooperatives and state-owned factories to produce agricultural tools in large quantities. However, in order to overcome the difficulties of insufficient manpower, animal power, fertilizer, and agricultural tools, all farmers also need to give play to their creativity, help each other, overcome difficulties, so as to effectively guarantee this year's spring sowing and promote the victory of the front.

    Question: Thanks to the many measures recently taken by the government, people's lives have gradually stabilized, but what countermeasures will the government take regarding the production of daily necessities and the circulation of goods?

    Answer: Nine months of war have made the people's lives extremely unstable, especially the people in the areas temporarily occupied by the enemy, whose lives are even more difficult. The Republic government has recently taken various measures to stabilize people's lives, such as setting up reception centers for disaster victims in war zones, establishing orphanages, supplying food to disaster victims in war zones, establishing academies for the children of martyrs, allocating relief supplies, implementing treasury loans, supplying building materials, and lending seeds. Now, the lives of many local people have stabilized a lot. Recently, in order to stabilize the people's lives, the Labor Party and the government have adopted a policy of strengthening the increase in production of necessities and the circulation of goods in the harsh war environment. The Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Commerce, consumer cooperatives, production cooperatives and other agencies will follow the policies of the Party and the government, use local resources, and increase the production of daily necessities. The commercial network of the Ministry of Commerce and consumer cooperatives will soon be restored. However, it also requires the creativity and social movement of all farmers; it requires the people's political power organs and labor party organizations to engage in careful and meticulous organizational work and guidance work.

　　金日成将军视察农村答农民问        
    指出不能等待胜利要组织和争取胜利        
    号召农民克服困难进行春播多打食粮
    【新华社平壤三日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成将军，曾于三月中旬视察平安南道各地农村情况和农民春耕播种的工作。各地农民热烈地向金日成将军表示了他们对祖国解放战争的胜利信心和坚强斗志，并提出他们最关心的问题。下面就是农民们所提出的三个问题和金日成将军回答的要点：
    问：目前战争的形势和前途如何？
    答：目前的战争形势是对我们有利的，其前途无疑将以朝鲜人民的最后胜利来结束。
    九个月的战争证明美国侵略者不但不能征服我们祖国和人民，而且由于英雄的人民军和中国人民志愿军的反攻而遭到了可耻的失败。今天我们已经具有取得胜利的一切条件，但这并不是说要等待胜利，而必须要组织和争取胜利。度过摆在我们面前重重难关的道路，就是争取胜利的道路。
    为了争取胜利，就要供给国家和军队以更多的粮食，进一步加强支前工作，及时修复道路桥梁，不耽误对前线的输送，以互相援助互相协助及自力更生的方法，安定自己的生活，更进一步巩固我们的后方，很好地保障一九五一年的春耕播种。
    问：在人力、畜力、种籽不足的战时条件下，怎样才能很好地保障今年的春季播种呢？
    答：无疑地，我们是要在困难的条件下来进行今年的春季播种。壮年男子都已手执武器为保卫祖国的独立自由和荣誉而上前线了。敌人在他们暂时侵占的期间，大量地宰割和掠夺了耕畜和粮谷种籽。我们农业生产的肥料泉源——兴南肥料厂，已经被野兽般的敌人炸毁了。农具和家产几乎全被敌人所破坏或掠夺。农村的这种情况，使得今年度的春季播种极为困难。但是，我们绝不能因为农村的情况是这样，就比去年少种地。前线和后方要求着更多的食粮，工业部门要求着更多的原料。“为食粮的斗争，就是为祖国的斗争！就是保障前线胜利的斗争！”“一粒谷物的增产也要重视！一寸土地也不要荒废！”这些口号应该成为我们农民的战斗口号。今年的播种就是战斗。我们在播种战线上的胜利，就意味着前线的胜利。
    共和国政府已经发布了“关于一九五一年度农产物播种工作”的决定，并以大批粮食和种籽借给没有粮食和种籽的农民，促进各生产合作社和国营工厂大量生产农具。但是，为了克服人力、畜力、肥料、农具不足的困难，还需要全体农民发挥创造力，互相协助，克服困难，以便有效地保障今年的春季播种，促进前线的胜利。
    问：由于政府最近采取了许多措施，人民生活已逐渐安定，但政府对日常必需品的生产和商品的流通采取怎样的对策呢？
    答：九个月的战争已使人民的生活极端不安，特别是在被敌人暂时侵占过的地区的人民，生活更是困苦不堪。共和国政府最近采取了安定人民生活的各种措施，如设置战区灾民收容所、设立孤儿院、供给战区灾民以粮食、设立烈士子女学院、配给救济物资、实行国库贷款、供给建筑器材、贷与种籽等。现在，很多地方人民的生活已经安定了许多。最近，劳动党和政府为了安定人民生活，采取了在残酷的战争环境下加强必需品的增产和商品流通的政策。产业省、商业省、消费组合、生产合作社等机关将按照党和政府的政策，利用地方资源，增加日常必需品的生产。商业省和消费组合的商业网即将恢复。但是，还需要全体农民的创造力和社会性的运动；需要人民政权机关和劳动党组织从事周密细致的组织工作和指导工作。
