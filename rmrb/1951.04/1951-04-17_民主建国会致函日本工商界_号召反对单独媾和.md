The Democratic National Construction Association Sends Letter to Japanese Business Community
Calling for Opposition to Separate Peace Treaty
[Report from this newspaper] The Democratic National Construction Association published "A Letter to the Japanese Business Community Opposing the U.S. Separate Peace Treaty with Japan and the Rearmament of Japan" on the 13th. The letter pointed out: "The U.S. plot to control China was completely destroyed due to the victory of the Chinese revolution, but in Japan, the U.S. monopoly plot is intensifying. The U.S. aggressive war in Korea has suffered continuous and severe setbacks and has fallen into a tragic situation that is doomed to fail and difficult to extricate itself from. Therefore, it has reverted to the plot of the Sino-Japanese War period, attempting to re-implement the poisonous trick of instigating Asian people to kill each other, and thus there are activities for a separate peace treaty with Japan and the rearmament of Japan." The letter continued: "For more than five years, the heinous crimes committed by the United States in conjunction with Japanese reactionary forces in Japan are certainly clearer to the Japanese people who have personally experienced them than to us. ... Through Japanese Zaibatsu, U.S. monopoly capital has controlled the economic lifeline of Japan, thereby continuously deteriorating the lives of the Japanese people. After the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, it transferred a large amount of Japanese civilian industry to military production. Therefore, in just a few months, it has caused the Japanese cost of living index to rise by half; more than 70 million Japanese people are trapped in dire straits, and the only beneficiaries are a small handful of Japanese comprador Zaibatsu headed by Yoshida. We have personally experienced the harm of malignant inflation, and its destructiveness to small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises is as serious as its destructiveness to the lives of poor people. The Japanese business community cannot turn a blind eye to this crisis." The letter also called for: "Japanese industrialists and businessmen, except for a few comprador Zaibatsu, the interests of the vast majority of people should be combined with the broad masses of Japanese people. You must rise up together, stand with workers, peasants, and students, and fight against this vicious conspiracy of U.S. imperialism!"

　　民主建国会致函日本工商界
    号召反对单独媾和
    【本报讯】民主建国会于十三日发表了《为反对美国单独对日媾和与重新武装日本给日本工商界的一封信》。信中指出：“美国控制中国的阴谋，由于中国革命的胜利，是彻底被摧毁了，但在日本，美国的独占阴谋却正在加紧地进行着。美国在朝鲜的侵略战争连续遭受严重的打击，已经陷于注定要失败而同时又难于自拔的惨境。于是，它重新回复到中日战争时期的阴谋，企图再施挑拨亚洲人民自相残杀的毒计，因而有对日单独媾和重新武装日本的活动。”信中接着说：“五年多来，美国结合日本的反动势力在日本所做的滔天罪行，身受的日本人民当然知道的比我们更清楚。………………通过日本的财阀，美国垄断资本已经控制了日本的经济命脉，从而使日本人民的生活不断地恶化。美国发动侵朝战争以后，把日本民用工业大量地转移到军事生产上去。因此，在短短的几个月当中，已经使得日本的生活指数上升了半倍；七千多万日本人民陷于水深火热之中，而得利的只是一小撮以吉田为首的日本买办财阀。恶性通货膨胀的危害，我们是亲身经验过的，它对于中小工商业的毁灭性，是和对于贫苦人民生活的毁灭性一样严重的。日本工商界对于这一危机也是不能熟视无睹的。”信中并号召：“日本的工商业者，除了少数的买办财阀以外，绝大多数人的利害是应该和广大的日本人民相结合的。你们必须一致奋起，与工、农、学生们站在一起，为反对美国帝国主义这一恶毒的阴谋而斗争！”
