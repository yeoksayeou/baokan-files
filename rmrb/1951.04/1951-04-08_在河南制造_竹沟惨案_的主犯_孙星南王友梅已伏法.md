Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 7th. Sun Xingnan and Wang Youmei, the main culprits in the "Zhugou Massacre" in Henan's Queshan County during the War of Resistance Against Japan, who murdered over 200 wounded soldiers and family members of anti-Japanese fighters from the New Fourth Army's garrison hospital, have been executed in Queshan and Biyang respectively.

　　The bandit Sun Xingnan successively served as the head of the Kuomintang Security Regiment and the commander-in-chief of Queshan and four other counties. In the winter of 1939, the bandit Sun personally directed bandits to attack the New Fourth Army's garrison in Zhugou Town, Queshan County, Henan, killing over 200 wounded New Fourth Army cadres, soldiers, and their family members due to their anti-Japanese injuries. The bandit Sun also buried alive over 100 merchants near Zhugou Town. After the liberation of Queshan, the bandit Sun even infiltrated a revolutionary school and continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, and was captured by our public security organs. The bandit Wang Youmei was a notorious local tyrant in Biyang County, Henan, who served as a Kuomintang county magistrate and the director of the "Communist Suppression" joint defense of Tanghe and three other counties. In 1936, when the people of Biyang held the "Three Resistances" movement (resisting conscription, resisting grain levies, and resisting financial levies) to oppose the Kuomintang reactionary rule, over 200 peasants were slaughtered by the bandit Wang. In the winter of 1939, the bandit Wang led bandits to attack the New Fourth Army's garrison in Zhugou Town, Queshan County, using a guillotine to execute the army cadres Wang Enfu, Song Bang, and others, and burned to death the New Fourth Army wounded who were being treated in the hospital. After liberation, the bandit Wang pretended to be progressive and infiltrated the local organization of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, using the name of a democratic party to continue engaging in counter-revolutionary activities and establishing contact with the US-Chiang secret service agencies in Hong Kong. However, he was eventually captured and brought to justice by our People's Public Security organs.

　　After the arrest of the two bandits, Sun and Wang, the people of Queshan, Biyang, and other places successively filed accusations, demanding the death penalty. The Henan Provincial Preparatory Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang also issued a statement announcing the expulsion of the bandit Wang from the party. The local people's courts successively convened public trials, accepted the demands of the masses, sentenced the two bandits to death, and, with the approval of the higher-level People's Government, executed them by firing squad in Queshan and Biyang on the 7th of last month and the 30th of last December, respectively.

　　在河南制造“竹沟惨案”的主犯
　  孙星南王友梅已伏法
    【新华社开封七日电】抗日战争时期，在河南确山县竹沟镇杀害新四军留守处医院中二百余伤员和抗日战士家属、制造“竹沟惨案”的主犯孙星南、王友梅已先后在确山、泌阳两地伏法。
    孙匪星南历任国民党保安团长、确山等四县总指挥等职。一九三九年冬，孙匪亲自指挥匪徒袭击河南确山县竹沟镇新四军留守处，杀害因抗日受伤的新四军干部、战士和他们的家属共二百余人。孙匪并在竹沟镇附近活埋商贩一百余人。确山解放后，孙匪竟混入革命学校，继续从事反革命活动，被我公安机关捕获。王匪友梅，系河南泌阳县大恶霸，曾任国民党县长，唐河等三县“剿共”联防主任等职。一九三六年，泌阳人民为反对国民党反动统治而举行“三抗”（抗丁、抗粮、抗款）运动时，遭王匪屠杀的农民达二百余人。一九三九年冬，王匪带领匪徒袭击确山县竹沟镇新四军留守处，用铡刀铡死该军干部王恩富、宋榜等多人，并用火烧死在医院中治疗的新四军伤员。解放后，王匪伪装进步，混入中国国民党革命委员会地方组织，假借民主党派的名义，继续进行反革命活动，并与香港美蒋特务机关取得联系。但终被我人民公安机关捕获归案。
    孙、王两匪被捕后，确山、泌阳等地人民纷纷控诉，要求处以极刑。中国国民党革命委员会河南省分部筹备委员会亦发表声明，宣布开除王匪党籍。两地人民法庭先后召开了公审大会，接受人民群众要求，判处两匪死刑，经上级人民政府批准，于上月七日及去年十二月三十日分别在确山、泌阳两地执行枪决。
