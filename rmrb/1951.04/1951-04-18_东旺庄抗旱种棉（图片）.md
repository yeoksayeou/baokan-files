Editor's Note: This is a series of comic strips drawn by the Agricultural Film Studio of the Ministry of Agriculture. The content of this series of comic strips is to promote the mobilization of farmers to improve tools and plant cotton in time during drought conditions; and to combine other techniques in the cotton planting process to increase cotton production. Currently, Hebei and other places are arranging drought-resistant cotton planting. Therefore, we specially publish this set of comic strips to provide leaders of cotton planting with reference and to provide farmers with technical assistance. The comic strip has a total of twenty-six panels and will be published over seven days.

In Nangong County, Hebei Province, there is a village called Dongwangzhuang. The farmers in this village have greatly benefited from planting cotton in recent years, and their enthusiasm for production has become even higher. As soon as the ground thawed last year, the mutual aid team led by Wang Shan began to prepare the land.

However, it was continuously dry and rainless until "Grain Rain," making it impossible to plant with a seed drill (referring to planting with a seed drill). The people in the village were very worried, but they couldn't think of a solution.

At this time, the government called for "organizing to combat drought and plant by dibbling," to overcome difficulties. However, the old farmer Fang Luoyi said, "Dibbling' is labor-intensive, let's wait for the rain!" Some people were discouraged when they heard this.

    东旺庄抗旱种棉
    周学梦画
    孟晓梦编
    编者按：这是农业部农业电影社画的一套连环画。这套连环画的内容是提倡在天旱的情况下，发动农民改良工具，不误农时地播种棉花；并结合种棉过程中的其他技术，使棉花的产量增加。目前河北等地正在布置抗旱种棉。因此，我们特别刊载这套连环画，目的是供给领导植棉的同志们参考，给农民们以技术上的帮助。连环画共二十六幅，分七天登完。
    河北省南宫县，有个东旺庄。这个庄里的农民，这几年种棉花获利很大，生产情绪更加高涨。去年地一解冻，王山领导的互助组，就开始整地。
    可是一直到了“谷雨”，还是天旱无雨，不能耩播（用耧播种的意思）。村里的人，都很发愁，但是想不出办法来。
    政府这时候号召“组织起来，抗旱点种”，克服困难。老农房洛义却说：“‘点种’费工费力，还是等雨吧！”有的人听了这话，就泄了气。
