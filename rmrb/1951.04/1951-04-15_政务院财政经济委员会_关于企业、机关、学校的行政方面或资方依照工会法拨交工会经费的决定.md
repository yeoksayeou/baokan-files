In accordance with the provisions of Article 24, Section 2 of the Trade Union Law: "The administrative side or capitalists of factories, mines, shops, farms, institutions, schools, and other production units or administrative units shall allocate 2% of the total actual wages (including monetary part, in-kind part, and meals) of all employees (excluding capitalist agents in private enterprises) to the trade union organization as trade union funds on a monthly basis." The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has already formulated the "Provisional Measures for the Collection and Payment of Trade Union Funds Allocated by the Administrative Side or Capitalists of Enterprises, Institutions, and Schools" and submitted it to this committee for review. In addition to approving these measures, this committee has made the following decisions:

    I. The administrative side or capitalists of enterprises, institutions, schools, and other production units or administrative units must comply with the aforementioned provisional measures for the allocation of trade union funds. Any existing local regulations that conflict with these measures shall be repealed.

    II. In order to ensure the timely and full allocation of trade union funds, trade union organizations at all levels may send personnel with supporting documents to the relevant administrative side or capitalists to examine the accounts of the number of employees and wages. The administrative side or capitalists shall assist and shall not refuse on any pretext.

    III. If the administrative side or capitalists fail to pay or underpay trade union funds on time, they shall pay a daily late fee, the amount of which shall be 1% of the unpaid or underpaid amount. If they fail to pay within ten days, if it is a government agency, public school, state-owned or joint state-private enterprise, the trade union organization may report it to the local labor administrative agency for handling.

    IV. Before the issuance of this decision, if the administrative side or capitalists of various enterprises, institutions, schools, and other production units or administrative units have not yet allocated trade union funds, if the grassroots trade union organization has been established in the production unit or administrative unit before August 1950, they shall make supplementary payments from August 1950 in accordance with the provisions of Finance and Economics Circular No. 716 issued by this committee on August 4, 1950. If an enterprise has not yet established a grassroots trade union organization, but a local trade union or industrial trade union organization has been established in its location, it shall start paying from April 1951. However, institutions that do not manage production enterprises, which have been previously notified to postpone the organization of trade unions, may temporarily not pay.

      Director: Chen Yun, April 9, 1951

    根据工会法第二十四条第二款“工厂、矿场、商店、农场、机关、学校等生产单位或行政单位的行政方面或资方，应按所雇全部职工（私营企业中资方代理人不在内）实际工资（包括货币部分、实物部分与伙食）总额的百分之二，按月拨交工会组织作为工会经费”之规定，中华全国总工会业已制订《关于企业、机关、学校的行政方面或资方拨交工会经费收缴暂行办法》送经本委审查，本委除同意该办法外，并作决定于下：
    一、企业、机关、学校等生产单位或行政单位的行政方面或资方，必须遵照该拨交工会经费暂行办法办理，各地原有规定如与该办法抵触者，应予废止。
    二、为保证工会经费的按期如数拨交，各级工会组织得派人持证明文件向有关行政方面或资方进行审查有关职工人数和工资的账目，行政方面或资方应予协助，不得借词拒绝。
    三、如行政方面或资方逾期未缴或欠缴工会经费时，应按日增缴滞纳金，其数额为未缴或欠缴额的百分之一；逾期十日仍未缴纳者，如系政府机关、公立学校、国营或公私合营企业，得由工会组织报请当地劳动行政机关处理之。
    四、在本决定发布前，各企业、机关、学校等生产单位或行政单位的行政方面或资方尚未拨交工会经费者，如该生产单位或行政单位在一九五零年八月以前已建立工会基层组织者，应依本委一九五零年八月四日财经总字第七一六号通令之规定，自一九五零年八月起补缴；如尚未建立工会基层组织的企业，而其所在地已建立地方工会或产业工会组织者，应自一九五一年四月起开始缴纳。但非管理生产企业的机关，前已通知暂缓组织工会，因此可以暂不缴纳。
