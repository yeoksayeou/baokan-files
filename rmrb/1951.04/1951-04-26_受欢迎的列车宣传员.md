　　Well-received Train Propagandist:

　　Editor:

　　On March 28th, I took the No. 105 ordinary passenger train departing from Beijing South. The train's propaganda work was warmly welcomed by the passengers. There were three people conducting propaganda on the train: a railway policeman and two train attendants. First, the railway policeman gave a brief introduction, explaining that the train attendants would perform a ballad for everyone. Then, the train attendants would start singing a rhythmic storytelling piece, playing bamboo clappers while singing and speaking, which was lively and engaging. On the train I was on, they were propagandizing about American imperialism rearming Japan, explaining the reasons for resisting America and aiding Korea, and also explaining railway regulations and travel instructions. After singing a short passage, they would provide a more accessible explanation. They sang clearly and explained clearly. Everyone listened carefully, and the originally noisy carriage became quiet. Elderly people left their original seats and moved closer to listen. After the storytelling was finished, the passengers in each row of seats immediately began to discuss it enthusiastically.

　　Why was their train propaganda so popular with passengers? I think the first reason is that the content of their storytelling was vivid and lively, and the language was accessible; secondly, they treated passengers warmly and kindly, and spoke as if they were chatting with family, which made the passengers feel close to them. Such train propagandists deserve praise.

### 受欢迎的列车宣传员

　　受欢迎的列车宣传员编辑同志：
    三月二十八日，我乘坐由北京南开的一○五次普通客车。该列车的宣传工作，受到旅客的热烈欢迎。在列车上进行宣传的有三个人，一个路警，两个列车员。先由路警作一简单介绍，说明有列车员给大家说唱一段什么事情。然后列车员就唱起快板，一面打着竹板，一面说唱，活泼动人。我坐的那辆车，是宣传美帝国主义重新武装日本，为什么要抗美援朝的道理，还讲解了铁路规章和坐车须知。唱完一小段之后，就进行一番更通俗的解释。他唱的清楚，解说的明白。大家都在仔细地听，原来嘈杂的车厢，都肃静了。上了年岁的老人，离开自己的原座位，凑近去听。说唱完了，各排座位间的旅客立刻热烈谈论起来。
    为什么他们的列车宣传能这样受到旅客欢迎呢？我觉得，第一是他们说唱的内容生动活泼，文词通俗；其次他们对待旅客热情和气，讲起话来像拉家常一样，使旅客都感到亲切。这样的列车宣传员，值得表扬。
