　　Harbin Railway Factory Actively Promotes the Kovalev Work Method
    Striving to Learn Enterprise Management and Strengthen Trade Union Work!
    I. Main Content of the Kovalev Work Method
    Currently, a new movement to promote advanced production experience in the style of Stakhanov is being widely carried out in various economic sectors and enterprises in the Soviet Union to improve production methods and increase labor efficiency. The initiator of this movement is the engineer Kovalev. Engineer Kovalev is the director of the Moscow "Proletarian Victory" Woolen Factory. Together with the factory's workers and technicians, after more than two years of research and experimentation, he derived the most scientific method for promoting advanced production experience. The main content of this advanced method is to study the production operation experience of Stakhanov workers who perform the same production, synthesize the advantages of each person's operation, and obtain the most perfect production operation method, which is then promoted among all workers, so that every worker can master advanced labor methods in the entire production process and individual production actions.
    In the Soviet Union's completion of the post-war five-year construction plan, tens of thousands of Stakhanov workers emerged. Their work experience and production methods are not only the most valuable property of the Soviet people, but also of the working people of the whole world. Therefore, using scientific methods to study and summarize the experience of advanced producers and promote it to various enterprises is an extremely important task.
    The Soviet Union's various industrial sectors have always attached great importance to promoting the experience of advanced producers. Kovalev has systematized and scientificized the methods of promoting this work, and raised it to a new level. In the past, in the factory led by Kovalev, 30 percent of the workers could not complete the production quota, but many Stakhanov workers could complete more than 120 percent of the quota. After detailed research and analysis, Kovalev found that the reason for the large difference in workers' completion of production quotas was that workers working in the same production department completed the same production process with different production methods and actions. Even the most outstanding Stakhanov workers, although their work achievements are the same, their work methods are also different.
    Any production process is made up of many actions. Based on the analysis and research of the production actions of each Stakhanov worker, Kovalev found that in the same production process, one Stakhanov worker does the first action faster and uses less time; another Stakhanov worker spends a little more time on the first action, but the second action is faster than the former; the third Stakhanov worker takes longer to do both actions, but he can allocate the working time very well, so that the machine is constantly running, so he can also get good work results. If a worker wants to complete his work perfectly, he must make all these actions the most reasonable and time-saving. Therefore, Kovalev came to the conclusion that scientifically studying and summarizing the production actions of several Stakhanov workers in the same production procedure, and combining their different good experiences, can obtain the most perfect method.
    In addition to action methods, rationally planning work time, organizing working conditions, and minimizing preparation time before work also play a significant role in improving labor productivity. For example, when a worker manages multiple machines at the same time, he must study which machine should be turned on first, and how to coordinate the machine's downtime to make the work the fastest. Therefore, enterprise leaders should also study these factors when studying production experience, and pay attention to the advanced experience of Stakhanov workers in planning work time and work positions.
    Now, the Soviet Union's workers and staff have widely launched a movement to learn the Kovalev work method, and various newspapers and publications call the popularization and promotion of the Kovalev work method "a new stage in further improving the Stakhanov movement."
    On September 1st last year, the Moscow Provincial Committee of the All-Union Communist Party held a meeting of workers, party workers, and trade union workers from various enterprises in Moscow Province. After listening to the report by Engineer Kovalev on "Methods of Summarizing and Consolidating Advanced Stakhanov Experience," the participants in the meeting launched a lively discussion. All speakers unanimously emphasized the value of Engineer Kovalev's initiative for all industrial sectors and the major national economy.
  II. The Situation of Promoting the Kovalev Work Method in Harbin Railway Factory
    New China's railway construction has already achieved brilliant achievements, which is mainly the result of the high enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government. The promotion and application of advanced Soviet experience in our country's railways plays an important role in improving our country's railway construction and further reasonably leveraging the wisdom and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. For example, since the Harbin Railway Factory piloted the Kovalev work method, it has not only achieved remarkable results in production, but also opened up a new path for the patriotic production competition.
    We know that the socialist system has eliminated the exploiting classes and liberated enormous productive forces. Workers are no longer working for capitalists but for themselves and for the increase of the entire socialist wealth. This idea transforms socialist labor into a glorious cause, a noble and heroic cause. As Lenin said: "Socialism does not extinguish competition, on the contrary, it first creates the possibility of making competition truly widespread, truly massive, truly attracting the broad masses of workers to the stage of work, where they can express their abilities and talents. The abilities and talents contained in these people are trampled and suffocated by capitalism in the hundreds of thousands." ("Complete Works of Lenin" (3rd edition, Volume 22, Page 158))
    In 1935, Comrade Stalin analyzed the emergence of the Stakhanov movement in the Soviet Union and pointed out the four main conditions for the emergence of this great and promising movement: 1. The improvement of the living standards of the working people; 2. The elimination of exploitation; 3. New technology; 4. New people who have mastered new technology. In our country, after liberation, the material welfare of workers has improved; it is not yet possible to completely eliminate the phenomenon of exploitation in the country's entire national economy, but exploitation has been eliminated in the state-owned economic sectors. Due to the existence of these conditions, hundreds of thousands of railway employees have emerged as labor model heroes, giving play to their initiative and creativity, learning advanced Soviet methods, and improving their work. The previously promoted system of responsibility for train crews, the new road maintenance method, the electrical maintenance method, etc., have all achieved great results. In particular, the Harbin Railway Factory's recent promotion of the Kovalev work method has created a more outstanding and typical example.
    Last December, Li Shusen, the director of the factory's mechanical branch, conducted propaganda among the workers, explaining the advantages of the Kovalev work method, and, in practice, studied the work of turning screws with the workers and found that there were five shortcomings in manufacturing car frame screws: 1. It takes a long time to close the car and punch the eye. The machine stops as soon as a person punches the eye. When the car is running and the tool is moved to punch the eye, the eyes are watching the work, but the hands are not able to punch it straight; 2. When measuring the size, the tool is not suitable, and it is shaken down again, wasting time; 3. It takes time to find and correct the workpiece, take the marking gauge, and send the marking gauge. Every screw has to go through four procedures, which wastes time; 4. The screw rod is not smooth, and it has to be filed, which uses manpower; 5. The material head after turning still needs a person to hammer. The machine turns less, and there is a lot of manual labor, wasting manpower, wasting machines, and wasting time.
    After detailed investigation and research, he believed that the original 14 actions to complete a screw operation could be shortened to 9 actions, and a flow-line operation method could be implemented using four machines to eliminate some of the above-mentioned time-wasting shortcomings.
    After setting this plan, a team was found as the focus of the pilot project. This team was composed of eight young workers, including Zhu Shiqing, and used four machines, working in two shifts. Because they are all young and enthusiastic about their work, they are willing to learn technology and accept new things more quickly. However, at that time, the team also had two concerns: one was that long-term screw turning could not improve technology; the other was that the mechanical efficiency was not strong and efficiency was not easy to improve. After repeated explanations and elimination of these two concerns by the branch leaders, the team began to work according to the intention of Branch Director Li Shusen, that is: implement sub-division operation and implement flow-line operation method. The results of the implementation were remarkable. For example, the original regulation for the engine frame screw was 40 minutes, and Zhu Shiqing, the fastest in the past, also took 30 minutes, but after applying the new method, the record for the first day was 14 minutes and 50 seconds, more than doubling the speed, and the next day it was further shortened to 14 minutes and 10 seconds.
    At noon on the third day, when everyone discussed this operation process, they found that Zhu Shiqing was the fastest at unloading the chuck when changing the workpiece. He did not use a wrench, but used an iron pad on the tool holder that fit the square of the chuck screw. When taking it down, he placed it in the square opening and it came down with a single move. Ding Haichang suggested that changing the workpiece takes time to take it down from the machine and then replace it. If two chucks are used, they can be replaced while the tool is moving. The second one can be taken down when it stops and installed, which is both fast and labor-saving. Another person discovered that using a four-jaw chuck to turn the length of the lock eye could be faster if a brake chuck was used. Combining these new methods further improved production efficiency and shortened the time to 13 minutes and 10 seconds.
    In the past, when turning the return rod, only two or three could be turned every day due to the excessive amount of roughing and the conservatism of the work method, while the Harbin Locomotive Depot had reached eleven as early as 1948. This unreasonable difference was mainly due to the leadership's failure to attach importance to the discovery and promotion of new things. In order to better launch the new production movement and promote the Kovalev work method, the factory sent people to the Harbin Locomotive Depot to retrieve the return rod for comparison and found that the roughing allowance for the turned product in this factory was 42 grams heavier than the turned product in the Harbin Locomotive Depot. Calculated on an annual workload basis, this factory needs 6 tons more forged steel on turning the return rod, worth approximately 120 million Northeast currency. After education, the cadres and employees began to pay attention to this problem. After inspection, dozens of similar phenomena were found.
    Since the Kovalev work method was successfully piloted in the Harbin Railway Factory and the Harbin Railway Locomotive Depot, the Huanggu Tun Rolling Stock Factory also began to adopt this new method in early January. The Chu Hongyi team conducted the experiment. In their work, they improved the machinery and rationally allocated the working time, shortening the turning of the axle box from 1.5 hours to 40 minutes. When the team was experimenting with the Kovalev method, the three members of the team initially had different work methods, and the work was divided into fast and slow. Wu Debin took 77 minutes, Li Chongduo took 50 minutes, and Chu Hongyi took 48 minutes. During the comparison process, the different methods each person used to achieve maximum production efficiency were discovered. Wu Debin's cutting depth when turning the axle box, both roughing and finishing, could be done in one pass, while others would rough and finish in two passes, thus wasting time in this action. The main reason why Chu Hongyi's production volume was so high was that he paid attention to every action of the work and made rational use of time, such as preparing the axle in advance when starting the machine to measure the axle, and being good at improving tools. Li Chongduo's greatest characteristic was that he was more skilled in technology and adopted an accelerated method of keeping his hands and feet busy at the same time. In this way, summarizing the different excellent work methods of the two people and promoting them in the same type of work made the production volume unprecedentedly high, creating a new record of turning one in 40 minutes.
  III. How to Study and Promote the Kovalev Work Method
    Because carrying out Kovalev's advanced work method can improve production organization and increase labor efficiency, it has been welcomed by the broad masses of workers. Since the Harbin Factory improved the screw turning method, the workers in each department have asked the leaders to implement the Kovalev work method within their scope of work. The workers have also actively studied in their work, and after obtaining experience, they immediately promoted it within the team. The workers' wages have also increased with the improvement of work efficiency. For example, Li Yulin's work on the bellows stop valve was stipulated to be 70 minutes. After improving the machinery and sub-dividing the operation, it was completed in 30 minutes, and his wage exceeded the basic wage by 81%. Worker Zaharov often lost money in the past eleven months, losing a total of 203 points. In December, he exceeded his own wage by 49%. In addition, the workers' skills have also been improved.
    The Kovalev work method is warmly welcomed by the masses of workers. Therefore, studying and promoting the Kovalev work method and deeply carrying out patriotic competition has become an important task in current production enterprises. How to study and promote the Kovalev work method?
    First, study and summarize the production experience of advanced workers. Before the study, it is necessary to first determine which production department to study, and then determine which production actions to study. Generally speaking, the production departments and production actions that account for a large proportion of the work should be studied first, as well as the work processes where the phenomenon of wasting raw materials and producing defective products is more serious. After the scope and object of the study are determined, select several advanced workers who can complete the production procedure most quickly based on the production results for study. When studying actions, several examples should be taken for comparison, and only one advanced worker should not be taken as the object. Because the perfect method comes from comparison. Every advanced worker has his own expertise and experience. Combining their advanced experiences can obtain the most perfect method.
    Secondly, when studying various production actions, do not only look at the speed of the actions, but must pay attention to whether they violate technical regulations, whether they violate safety principles, whether they are extremely labor-intensive, and whether they waste raw materials and reduce the quality of finished products. If a worker's actions are very fast, but he works with extreme labor intensity, and is exhausted after work, this production method cannot be regarded as a good method, because a good production method should be able to complete the actions quickly and evenly. Also, if a worker can complete his actions quickly, but he wastes more materials in production, or the product quality is very low, then this production method has no value in promotion. Therefore, when comparing and studying production methods, they should not only be safe, fast, labor-saving, and not waste raw materials and reduce product quality, but also save raw materials and improve product quality.
    Third, prepare for promotion. First of all, it should be noted whether the equipment is suitable after the new method is adopted. Secondly, the raw material supply work should also be done well, so as to avoid the phenomenon of work stoppage waiting for materials after the production efficiency is improved. In addition, some cadres who promote advanced production experience should be trained to guide general workers at any time. At the same time, print out instructions introducing advanced actions and distribute them to workers. The instructions should be written in words that workers can understand. They should be simple and clear, and the production method should be explained in detail using technical principles that workers can understand. When introducing each of the best actions, the name of the inventor should also be given.
    Fourth, promote advanced production methods step by step. First divide the workers into groups, and have trained comrades teach them, explain the methods of the actions in detail, and actually test them for everyone to see. After most of the workers have learned one action, they can then proceed to learn another action. A small number of workers who are slower in progress will form another group, and trained technical instructors will continue to guide them.
    When summarizing and promoting advanced production experience, each production unit should proceed correctly according to the above four points. If this work is to be done well, it is necessary to enable technicians and advanced workers to help and cooperate with each other in their work. Technicians help and improve advanced workers technically, while advanced workers can enrich the knowledge of engineering and technical personnel with practical production experience. In November last year, the engineers of the Harbin Factory studied the threading die and sent the design drawings to the tool workshop to make them. After they were made and connected to the planer, the threads could not be threaded during the test. The workers suggested that there was no threading material inlet, and the engineers did not quite believe it. After several more tests, it was still the same as before. As a result, the workers used a grinding wheel to grind the threading material inlet, and then the threads could be threaded. However, the screw cap could not be screwed in, and the workers suggested that the diameter of the screw raw material be changed to 8.2 mm. The engineers also re-adjusted according to the length of the slope of the threading material inlet ground by the workers, the number of revolutions required for threading, and the length of the die. The entire threading was successfully studied. In addition, when the machinery plant of the factory first used Soviet high-speed cemented carbide tools, because it was necessary to drive fast cars (up to 800 revolutions), the workers did not have the confidence to use them. After the Soviet comrades personally tested and explained them, the workers generally had a understanding. However, when the factory made the tools, the engineers relied on theoretical production. When they were taken to the lathe for use, the workers suggested: "The angle of the tool is too large and it is not easy to use. The angle should be ground upwards." At that time, the engineer did not adopt this suggestion and began to mill the connecting rod of the locomotive. One side of the tool could only mill 2.5 mm deep. If 6 mm were milled, it would have to go back and forth three times, which would consume a lot of time, indicating that the tool and the machinery had not yet fully exerted their due effectiveness. At this time, the leaders re-studied the opinions put forward by the workers and decided to grind a tool first and try it. At the same time, they solicited the opinions of the workers when sharpening the tool, and thought that the angle was suitable, and then tested it. As a result, it cut 6 mm deep at once. This fact proves that although the experience of the workers has no theoretical basis, it at least has its own truth and empirical basis, and technicians should not despise it. Now, the machinery plant of the factory has shortened the time for milling the connecting rod of the locomotive from 15 hours in the past to 6.5 hours. These are all the results of combining the scientific knowledge of technicians with the experience of workers.
    It is particularly important that we must recognize that using the Kovalev work method and promoting advanced production experience is a long-term task. Just as Comrade Volkov, Secretary of the Moscow Provincial Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, called on the participants at the meeting of economic workers, party workers, and trade union workers from various enterprises last September, "We must unswervingly, carefully and regularly promote the valuable methods of Engineer Kovalev, select the best work methods, the best planned working hours and forms of labor organization, and absorb all engineers, technical workers, foremen and a large number of production innovators to participate in this work. To prevent the mistakes of some enterprise leaders, that is, to understand the methods of Engineer Kovalev as a routine temporary movement. The promotion of this important initiative cannot be left to its own course. It requires all economic workers, experts, and all party, trade union, and group organizations to carry out extensive and careful work." (Pravda, September 2, 1950) This is because advanced production methods are not immutable, they are constantly being improved, so the research work must be constant. In addition, each unit has its own special production conditions, so the Kovalev method should be combined with the specific conditions of the unit, and the method should be used flexibly. If special problems occur, they must be solved by all staff in practice.
    At present, the patriotic production competition has been enthusiastically launched in various places. We must clearly define the characteristics of the competition, which is to generate higher labor productivity, and to oppose stagnation and conservatism. In life, there is always a new and growing side, and an old and dying side. Studying new seedlings, timely supporting these seedlings, and making them a progressive force in development, this is the valuable quality of the Bolsheviks that Comrade Stalin called – the feeling of new things. Therefore, we must pay attention to new things, vigorously promote the Kovalev work method, and improve the production competition movement, thereby increasing our economic strength and national defense strength.

　　哈尔滨铁路工厂积极推行郭瓦略夫工作方法
    为学会企业管理和加强工会工作而斗争！
    一、郭瓦略夫工作方法之主要内容
    目前苏联各经济部门各企业中，正在广泛开展一个新的推广斯达哈诺夫式的先进生产经验的运动，以改进生产方法，提高劳动效率。这个运动的倡导者是郭瓦略夫工程师。郭瓦略夫工程师是莫斯科“无产阶级胜利”呢绒工厂的厂长，他同全厂工人及技术人员一起，经过二年多的研究和试验，得出了一个最科学的推广先进生产经验的方法。这个先进方法的主要内容便是研究那些作同一生产的斯达哈诺夫工人的生产作业经验，综合各人作业的优点，得出一个最完善的生产作业方法，然后在全体工人中推行，使得每一个工人在全部的生产过程和单独的生产动作上，都能够掌握先进的劳动方法。
    苏联在完成战后五年建设计划中，涌现出成千成万的斯达哈诺夫工作者，他们的工作经验和生产方法，不仅是苏联人民，同时也是全世界劳动人民最宝贵的财产，因此，以科学的方法来研究和总结先进生产者的经验，并将它推广到各企业中去，乃是一件异常重要的工作。
    苏联各工业部门一向很重视推广先进生产者的经验。而郭瓦略夫则把推进这一工作的方法更加系统化和科学化，并且将它提高了一大步。过去，在郭瓦略夫领导的工厂内，有百分之三十不能完成生产定额，然而有许多斯达哈诺夫工人却能完成定额的百分之一百二十以上。郭瓦略夫在经过详细研究和分析后，发现工人在完成生产定额方面相差很大的原因是：在同一生产部门中工作的工人，是以不同的生产方法和动作来完成同一生产过程的。即使是最优秀的斯达哈诺夫工人，他们的工作成绩虽然相同，但是他们的工作方法也是不同的。
    任何一种生产过程都是由许多动作积成的。根据对每一个斯达哈诺夫工人生产动作的分析和研究，郭瓦略夫发现在同一生产过程中，某一个斯达哈诺夫工人第一个动作做得快一些，用的时间较少；另外一个斯达哈诺夫工作者在第一个动作虽然多用点时间，但是第二个动作却较前者为快；第三个斯达哈诺夫工人作这两个动作都要用较长的时间，但他能将工作时间分配得很好，使机器一刻不停地转动，所以也能获很好的工作成绩。一个工人如果要完善地完成他的工作，他就必须把所有这些动作都做得最合理、最节省时间。因此郭瓦略夫得出一个结论：科学地研究并总结同一生产手续的好多个斯达哈诺夫工人的生产动作，把他们彼此不同的好的经验结合在一起，就可以得到一个最完善的方法。
    除了动作方法以外，合理地计划工作时间，组织工作条件，以及尽量缩短工作前的准备时间等，对于劳动生产率的提高也起有很大的作用。如当一个工人同时管理多架机器的时候，他就必须研究应先开那架机器，怎样配合机器的停顿时间以使工作做得最快。因此，各企业领导上在研究生产经验的时候，也应该研究这些因素，注意斯达哈诺夫工人在计划工作时间和工作位置方面的先进经验。
    现在苏联各地职工已广泛展开了学习郭瓦略夫工作方法的运动，各个报纸刊物上都把郭瓦略夫工作方法的普及和推广叫做“斯达哈诺夫运动更提高一步的新阶段”。
    去年九月一日，联共莫斯科省委会举行了一个莫斯科省各企业工作者、党工作者、工会工作者会议。会议的参加者们倾听郭瓦略夫工程师“关于总结和巩固先进的斯达哈诺夫经验的方法”报告后，展开了热烈生动的讨论。所有讲演人都一致强调郭瓦略夫工程师的创举，对于所有工业部门的重大国民经济的价值。
  二、郭瓦略夫工作方法在哈尔滨铁路工厂推行的情况
    新中国的铁路建设业已获得辉煌成就，这主要是在中国共产党和中央人民政府正确领导之下，广大工人群众劳动热情高涨的结果。而苏联先进经验在我国铁路上的推广运用，对于提高我国铁路建设和进一步合理发挥工人群众的智慧与劳动热忱是有重要作用的。例如自从哈尔滨铁路工厂试行郭瓦略夫的工作方法后，不仅在生产上有了卓越的成绩，而且给爱国主义生产竞赛开辟了一个新的途径。
    我们知道社会主义制度肃清了剥削阶级，把巨大的生产力解放出来，劳动者才不是为资本家而是为自己为整个社会主义财富的增加而工作，这种思想把社会主义劳动变成光荣的事业，变成崇高与英勇的事业。正如列宁所说：“社会主义不但不熄灭竞赛，相反的首先创造可能使竞赛真正广泛，真正有群众规模，真正吸引广大劳动群众到工作舞台上来，在这里他们可以表现自己的能力，表现自己的才干。这些人民中蕴藏着的能力和才干，成千成万为资本主义所蹂躏践踏和窒息。”《列宁全集》（第三版二二卷一五八页）
    斯大林同志在一九三五年分析苏联出现斯达哈诺夫运动时，指出了产生这个伟大前途的运动的四个主要条件：一、劳动人民生活水准的提高；二、剥削的消灭；三、新的技术；四、掌握了新技术的新的人。在我们的国家里，解放以后，工人的物质福利已经有了改善；在国家的全部国民经济中，现在还谈不上完全消灭剥削现象，但是在国营经济部门中，剥削是消灭了。由于这些条件的存在，数十万铁路员工中涌现了许多劳动模范英雄，发挥了积极性和创造性，学习苏联的先进方法，改进工作。像过去推行的乘务负责制、新养路法、电务维修法等，都收到了很大成绩，特别是最近哈尔滨铁路工厂推行郭瓦略夫的工作方法，创造了更突出更典型的范例。
    去年十二月，该厂机械分厂厂长李树森在工人中进行宣传，讲解郭瓦略夫工作方法的优点，并在实际工作中与工友们一道研究旋螺丝的工作，发现制造车架螺丝时有五项缺点，是：一、关上车打洋冲眼，时间很长，人一打眼，机器就停了，开车走刀打眼，眼睛看着活，手又打不正；二、量尺寸时上刀不合适，再摇下来，浪费了时间；三、卡活找正，拿划针盘，送划针盘，每一螺丝要经过四道手续，又费了时间；四、螺丝杆不光滑，还要用锉刀，使用了人力；五、旋完后的料头还要用一个人用锤砸。机器转动的少，手工特别的多，浪费了人力，浪费了机器，也浪费了时间。
    他经过详细调查研究的结果，认为可以把原来完成一个螺丝作业的十四个动作，缩短到九个动作，而且可以用四台床子实行流水作业法，免去上述的一些浪费时间的缺点。
    定出了这样的一个计划后，便找到了一个小组作为重点试行，这个小组是由青年工友朱世清等八名组成，使用四台床子，分两班工作。因为他们都是青年，工作热情很高，愿意学技术，接受新鲜事物也较快。但是，在当时这个小组也有两个顾虑：一个认为长时期的旋螺丝不能提高技术；一个是认为机械效能不强，效率不易提高。这两个顾虑经分厂领导反复解释消除以后，小组便开始按照李树森分厂长的意图进行工作，就是说：实行分部作业，实行流水作业法。实行的结果成效卓著。例如：机车车架螺丝原规定是四十分钟一个，过去最快的朱世清也作三十分钟，但应用了新的方法后，第一天的纪录是十四分五十秒，提高了一倍多，第二天更进一步缩短到十四分十秒。
    到第三天中午，大家讨论这个作业过程时，发现朱世清在换活时卸卡头最快，他不使用搬子，而用铁垫把在刀架上，适合于卡头螺丝的方，拿下来的时候放在方口，一搬就下来。丁海昌提出换活从床子上拿下来，卸开后再换上，这样费时间，如果使用两个卡头，利用走刀时换好，第二个停车拿下来就装上，既快又省工，另一人发现了锁眼旋长短使用四眼卡盘，如果改用制动卡盘还能快，把这些新的方法汇集起来，又提高了生产效率，缩短到十三分十秒。
    在旋制回动杆时，过去因荒料余量过大和工作方法上的保守，每天只能旋两三个，而哈尔滨机务段远在一九四八年即达到十一个，这种不合理的差额，主要是领导上没有重视一个新鲜事物的发现与推广所致。该厂为了更好的展开新的生产运动，推广郭瓦略夫的工作方法，便派人到哈尔滨机务段取回回动杆，作一对比，发现本厂旋品荒料比哈尔滨机务段旋品荒料重四公两，按全年工作量计算，本厂在旋制回动杆上需多六吨锻钢，约值东北币一亿二千万元。经教育后，干部及职工均开始重视这一问题，经过检查，发现类似这些现象有数十种。
    自从郭瓦略夫工作方法在哈尔滨铁路工厂及哈尔滨铁路机务段试点成功后，皇姑屯车辆厂也在一月上旬开始采用这一新方法，由初鸿义小组作试验，他们在工作中改善了机械，合理地支配工作时间，旋动轮轴箱由一点半钟缩短到四十分钟。该组在试验郭瓦略夫方法时，小组三人最初因工作方法不同，工作也分出了快慢，吴德滨用七十七分钟，李崇多用五十分钟，初鸿义用四十八分钟。在对比过程中，发现每个人达到最高生产效率的不同方法，吴德滨镟轴箱代油量，连荒带光，一刀就可以镟下来，而别人都是荒一刀，光一刀，因此在这一动作上浪费了时间。初鸿义生产量所以高的主要原因，是他注意工作的每一个动作和合理的运用了时间，比如开车量轴，事先准备好轴，并善于改进工具。李崇多的最大特点，是技术比较熟练，采取手脚一齐忙的加速方式。这样汇总了二个人不同的优秀的工作方法，推广在同一性质的工作上，使生产量空前提高，创造了四十分钟镟一个的新纪录。
  三、如何研究和推广郭瓦略夫的工作方法
    由于开展郭瓦略夫的先进工作方法，能够改进生产组织提高劳动效率，因此受到广大工人群众的欢迎。哈尔滨工厂自从改进镟螺丝方法后，各部门的工友都纷纷要求领导上在他们的工作范围内实行郭瓦略夫的工作方法，工友们也主动地在工作中研究，得出经验后，马上就在小组内推广。工友们的工资也随着工作效率的提高而多挣了。如李玉林作风箱止阀，规定是七十分钟，经改进机械、分部作业后，结果三十分钟就完成了，他的工资超过了基本工资百分之八十一。扎哈洛夫工友在过去十一个月中，经常赔账，共赔了二百零三分，十二月份便超过本人工资百分之四十九。另外，工友们的技术也提高了。
    郭瓦略夫工作方法既受工人群众的热烈欢迎，因此研究和推广郭瓦略夫的工作方法，深入开展爱国主义竞赛，就成为目前生产企业中的一项重要工作。如何研究和推广郭瓦略夫工作方法呢？
    第一、研究并总结先进工作者的生产经验。在研究前，首先要确定研究那一个生产部门，然后再确定研究那些生产动作。一般说，应该先研究工作中占较大比重的生产部门和生产动作，研究浪费原料和出产废品现象较为严重的那些工作过程。研究的范围和对象确定后，根据生产成绩，挑出几个能够最迅速完成该生产手续的先进工人来研究。研究动作时，应该多取几个例子作比较，不可只取一个先进工人作对象。因为完善的方法是从比较中得来的，每一个先进工人都有他的特长和心得，将他们先进的经验结合起来，才能得到一个最完善的方法。
    其次，在研究各种生产动作的时候，不可单看动作的速度，必须注意到是否违反技术规程、是否破坏了安全的原则，是否是极大的劳动强度，是否浪费原料和降低成品的质量。如果一个工人的动作很快，但是他是以极大的劳动强度来工作的，一下班就弄得精疲力竭，这样的生产方法不能算作好的方法，因为一种好的生产方法是应该能够迅速而又匀称地完成动作的。又如果某一工人能很快地做完他的动作，但是他在生产时要多费料，或者产品质量很低，那么这种生产方法也就没有推广的价值。因此，在比较和研究生产方法时，不仅安全、迅速、省力、不浪费原料和降低产品质量，并且应该节省原料和提高产品质量。
    第三、推广前要做好准备工作。首先应该注意到采用新的方法后，装备是否适宜。其次还要做好原料供应工作，以免在生产效率提高后，发生停工待料现象。另外，应当训练一些推广先进生产经验的干部，以便随时指导一般工人。同时印出介绍先进动作的说明书。将它们分发给工人。说明书要用工人能够懂得的文字来写，要简单明了，并且要以工人能够理解的技术原理来详细说明生产方法。在介绍每一个最好的动作时，还应该提出发明者的名字。
    第四、要有步骤地推广先进的生产方法。先把工人分成小组，由受过训练的同志向他们讲授，详细说明动作的方法，并实际试验给大家看。等到大多数工人学会一个动作以后，再进行另外一个动作的学习。少数进度比较慢的工人，则另成立一个小组，由受过训练的技术指导员继续指导他们。
    各生产单位在总结和推广先进生产经验的时候，应该依照上述四点去正确进行。这个工作如果要做好，必须要使技术人员和先进工人在工作中能够互助合作。技术人员在技术上帮助并提高先进工人，而先进工人则能以实际的生产经验丰富工程技术人员的知识。去年十一月份哈尔滨工厂工程师研究搓螺丝钣牙，制出设计图后送到工具场去作，作完接在刨床子上，试验时搓不出丝扣来，工友们就提出没有搓料入口，工程师还不大相信，又试验几遍还和以前一样。结果工友们用砂轮给磨成搓料入口，才搓出丝扣来，但螺丝帽还拧不进去，工友又提出把螺丝原料直径改为八·二粍，工程师又根据工友所磨去的搓料入口坡度长，重新按搓螺丝所需要的转数、延长钣牙长度，整个搓螺丝才研究成功。另外该厂机械场在开始使用苏联高速度硬质合金刀时，因为必须打快车（最高八百转），工友们没有信心使用，后经苏联同志的亲自试验与讲解，工友们才普遍有了认识，但在本场制作刀的时候，工程师是依靠理论制作的，拿到车床去使用，工友们就提出意见说：“刀的角度大，不好用，应该角度向上磨。”当时工程师并没有采纳这个意见，就开始铣机车连杆，上一面刀只能铣二个半粍深度，如果铣六粍得来回走三次刀，消耗时间很长，说明还没有全部发挥刀及机械应有的效能，这时候领导把工友所提出的意见重新研究后，就决定先磨一把刀试试，同时在磨刀的时候征求工友意见，认为角度适合了，再去试验，结果一下就切去了六粍深度。从这个事实证明工友的经验虽然没有理论根据，但起码也有他的道理和经验根据，技术人员是不应该轻视的，现在该厂机械场铣机车连杆已由过去十五小时作一个，缩短到六时半就作完。这些都是技术人员的科学知识与工人的经验结合所收到的成果。
    特别重要的是我们必须认识运用郭瓦略夫的工作方法，推广先进生产经验是一个长期的工作。正如去年九月联共莫斯科省委书记沃尔科夫同志在各企业经济工作者、党工作者、工会工作者会议上的号召与会人员“要不屈不挠，细心并经常地推行郭瓦略夫工程师的宝贵方法，挑选最好的工作方法，最好地计划工时和组织劳动的形式，吸收所有的工程师、技术工作者、领班和生产革新分子的广大群众来参加这件工作。要预防若干企业领导者的错误，即把郭瓦略夫工程师的方法理解为一种例常的暂时的运动。推广这个重要的创举不能令其自流。它需要所有的经济工作者、专家，所有党、工会、团的组织进行广大的细心的工作。”（真理报，一九五○年九月二日）这正因为先进的生产方法不是不变的，它是在不断地改进着的，所以研究的工作必须是经常的。另外各单位都是具有自己特殊的生产条件，因此应该将郭瓦略夫方法与本单位的具体情况结合起来，灵活地运用这个方法，如果发生特殊问题，必须由全体工作人员在实践中寻求解决。
    目前爱国主义生产竞赛已在各地热烈开展，我们必须明确竞赛的特点，是产生更高的劳动生产率，是反对停滞不前和因循守旧。在生活中总是存在新的及生长的一面，和旧的死亡的一面。研究新的萌芽，适时地赞助这些萌芽，并使之成为发展中进步的力量，这就是斯大林同志所称的布尔什维克宝贵的品质——新鲜事物的感觉。因此，我们必须重视新鲜事物，大力推广郭瓦略夫的工作方法，使生产竞赛运动提高一步，从而增加我们的经济力量与国防力量。
