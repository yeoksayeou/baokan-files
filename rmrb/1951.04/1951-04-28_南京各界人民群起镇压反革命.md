Nanjing People of All Circles Rise Up to Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries

[Reported by this newspaper] The Nanjing Municipal People's Government is vigorously suppressing counter-revolutionaries, which has been enthusiastically supported by people from all walks of life. The masses have gathered to discuss and spontaneously report secret agents. A high tide of suppressing counter-revolutionaries has now been set off in the city.

In order to correctly implement the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government discussed the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries at the Municipal People's Representative Conference held from April 8th to 12th. On April 10th, the Consultative Committee of the Municipal People's Representative Conference and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly initiated and convened a mobilization meeting of people from all walks of life to implement the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries. The above two meetings played a significant role in promoting the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. With indignation, the broad masses reported secret agents. According to half-day statistics, the masses reported 146 hidden secret agents. There were sons reporting fathers, wives reporting husbands, and nephews reporting uncles. The Municipal People's Government accepted the just demands of the broad masses of citizens and executed a group of secret agents, habitual bandits, and bullies with heinous crimes on April 13th and 14th, and arrested a group of the worst counter-revolutionary elements on the 15th. The broad masses, having witnessed the fate of these counter-revolutionary elements who had committed many evils, applauded and unanimously thanked the People's Government for eliminating harm for the people. When the secret agent Miao Fengchi was executed, as many as 80,000 people flocked to the execution ground to watch.

After the mobilization meeting, people from all walks of life held various forums or informal discussions. At the same time, the representatives of the People's Representative Conference also focused on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries when communicating with the masses, which further enhanced the broad masses' understanding of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. At the small gatherings held by people from all walks of life, the attendees unanimously expressed that they would continue to assist the People's Government in eliminating counter-revolutionary elements, strengthen the organization for preventing spies and secret agents, and support the wise measures of the People's Government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries by doing practical work well. Many units have also put forward specific plans. In factories and enterprises, workers and staff have asked to join the picket teams and improve the safety system to prevent sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements. For example, the staff of Jiangnan Automobile Company did not pay enough attention to the safety system in the past, and the pickets were often late or left early when on duty. However, after listening to the broadcast of the mobilization meeting, the workers said: Suppressing counter-revolutionaries cannot rely solely on the government; our picket team must also be strengthened. The next day, the company convened a picket work meeting, reviewed past shortcomings, and established a safety system. The company's employees also voluntarily put forward the task of repairing five damaged vehicles ahead of schedule. Business circles expressed that they would support the People's Government's suppression of counter-revolutionaries with practical actions such as reporting secret agents and continuing to pay taxes collectively. In the past, many industrialists and businessmen in Xiaguan had concerns about reporting secret agents, but now many people say: With the government backing us up, what are we afraid of when reporting secret agents? We must boldly report them. On the day of listening to the broadcast, some people reported some counter-revolutionary elements on the spot. More than 1,000 boat people in the Xiaguan area jointly guaranteed that they would widely convey the spirit of the mobilization meeting to the boat people and were determined to strengthen the safety of navigation and transportation, implement the patriotic pact, and strictly prevent sabotage by secret agents. Cao Yuzhen, the director of the Women's Federation in the jurisdiction of Yijiangmen Public Security Police Station, is a youtiao seller. After listening to the live broadcast, she sold youtiao while publicizing the crimes of secret agents and paying attention to suspicious people at any time. She once persuaded a woman to voluntarily hand over a gun and four bullets.

　　南京各界人民群起镇压反革命
    【本报讯】南京市人民政府大张旗鼓镇压反革命，获得各界人民的热诚拥护。群众纷纷集会讨论，自动检举特务。现全市已掀起了一个镇压反革命的高潮。
    南京市人民政府为了正确贯彻执行惩治反革命条例，在四月八日到十二日举行的市各界人民代表会议上，曾讨论了镇压反革命的问题。四月十日，该市各界人民代表会议协商委员会又与市总工会共同发起召开了各界人民贯彻执行惩治反革命条例的动员大会。以上两个会议对推动镇压反革命工作起了很大作用。广大群众在怒不可遏的情绪下，纷纷检举特务。仅据半天的统计，群众检举了隐藏的特务即达一百四十六人。有儿子检举父亲的，有妻子检举丈夫的，有外甥检举舅父的。市人民政府接受广大市民的正义要求，在四月十三、四两日连续处决了一批罪恶昭彰的特务、惯匪及恶霸，并于十五日逮捕了一批反革命首恶分子。广大群众亲眼看见这些作恶多端的反革命分子的下场，莫不拍手称快，一致感谢人民政府为民除害。在处决特务缪凤池时，蜂拥至刑场观看的即达八万人。
    在动员大会后，各界人民纷纷召开各种座谈会或漫谈会；同时各界人民代表会议的代表也以镇压反革命问题作为中心向群众传达，因而更进一步提高了广大群众对镇压反革命的认识。在各界人民举行的小型集会上，到会的人一致表示今后将继续协助人民政府肃清反革命分子，加强防奸细防特务组织，并要以作好实际工作来支持人民政府镇压反革命的贤明措施，许多单位并已提出具体计划。在工厂企业方面，职工们纷纷要求加入纠察队，并健全了安全制度，以防止反革命分子的破坏。如江南汽车公司职工过去对安全制度不够重视，纠察员在值班时有迟到早退现象。但在收听动员大会的控诉广播后，工人们都说：镇压反革命不能光靠政府，我们的纠察队也要加强才行。第二天该公司即召开了纠察工作会议，检查了过去的缺点，订立了安全制度。该厂职工并自动提出了提前修好五辆废车的任务。工商界表示要以检举特务和继续集体纳税等实际行动。来拥护人民政府镇压反革命。如下关过去有不少工商业家对检举特务有顾虑，现在许多人都表示：有政府给我们撑腰，检举特务还怕什么？一定大胆检举。在那天收听广播时，当场就有人检举了一些反革命分子。下关一带的水上船民一千多人共同保证，将动员大会的精神普遍向船民传达，并决心加强航行与运输的安全，贯彻爱国公约，严防特务破坏。挹江门公安派出所辖区妇女会主任曹玉珍是个卖油条的，她自听了实况广播后，就一面作生意，一面宣传特务的罪行，并随时注意形迹可疑的人。她曾经说服一个妇女，自动交出一支枪和四粒子弹。
