The All-China Federation of Trade Unions
Interim Measures Regarding the Collection of Trade Union Dues from the Administrative or Capital Side of Enterprises, Institutions, and Schools

Article 1. These measures are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 24, Paragraph 2 of the Trade Union Law.

Article 2. All enterprises, institutions, and schools that have established grassroots trade union organizations, or enterprises that have not established grassroots trade union organizations, but where local or industrial trade union organizations have been established, shall allocate trade union dues in accordance with the following provisions:

	I. The administrative or capital side of enterprises, institutions, schools, and other production or administrative units shall, when paying wages each month, fill out a payment slip, have it signed and sealed by the chairman of the grassroots trade union organization or industrial trade union, or local trade union, and submit it along with the trade union dues to the People's Bank of China entrusted by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for collection.

	II. If the higher-level authorities of various institutions, public schools, and state-owned enterprises and other production or administrative units can uniformly allocate trade union dues, they should try to adopt a unified allocation method when paying wages each month. For example, public schools can be uniformly allocated by the local education departments (bureaus) to local educational trade union organizations; railway, postal and telecommunications, and ordnance units can be uniformly allocated by the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and the Ordnance Bureau to the National Committees of the respective industrial trade unions. Other similar situations can be handled through consultation between local trade unions, industrial trade unions, and relevant administrative departments, but must be reported to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for record.

	III. If the trade associations of private enterprises can and are willing to handle the unified allocation of trade union dues, they may negotiate and sign an agreement with the industrial trade union or local trade union to allocate them uniformly on a monthly basis. The allocation method is the same as stipulated in the first paragraph.

	IV. For those implementing a contract labor system, the administrative or capital side of the contracting unit directly paying the workers' wages shall calculate and allocate trade union dues each month based on the actual total wages paid.

	V. For enterprises that implement a profit-sharing wage system, such as theaters, hotels, restaurants, bathhouses, barber shops, etc., the capital side shall calculate the total wages based on the actual income of employees from profit-sharing and allocate trade union dues accordingly.

	VI. When the administrative or capital side of enterprises, institutions, schools, and other production or administrative units allocate trade union dues, they must calculate and allocate trade union dues in accordance with the method for calculating the total wage amount announced by the Central Financial and Economic Commission.

	VII. If it is indeed difficult for the administrative or capital side of small enterprises with a small number of employees to directly submit payments to the bank, or if there is no People's Bank of China locally, the dues may be collected directly by the grassroots trade union organization from the administrative or capital side. Before collecting from the administrative or capital side, the grassroots trade union organization must obtain uniformly printed receipts affixed with the trade union seal from the higher-level trade union organization; after collecting funds from the administrative or capital side, it shall immediately submit the receipt stub along with the collected funds to the higher-level trade union organization, which will summarize and fill out the payment slip and submit it to the People's Bank of China.

Article 3. All levels of trade unions above the grassroots trade union organizations must compile a monthly report on the allocation of trade union dues by the administrative or capital side of the subordinate trade union organizations, compile them level by level, and submit them to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

Article 4. When the higher-level trade union organizations above the grassroots trade union organizations receive the trade union dues allocated by the administrative or capital side of the production or administrative units, except for the 1.5% of the actual total wage amount for cultural and educational expenses, the scope of use and method of remittance of which are otherwise stipulated, the scope of use of the remaining 0.5% of the total wage amount shall be handled in accordance with the following provisions:

	I. If the municipal organizations of the industrial trade unions have been established and are sound, in addition to paying a portion to the local municipal federation of trade unions as a regulatory fund for the municipal industrial trade unions according to their expenditure situation, the amount of which shall not exceed 30% at most, the remainder shall be managed by themselves.

	II. If the municipal organizations of the industrial trade unions have not been established or are unsound, they shall all be handed over to the local municipal federation of trade unions for unified management and used as funds for the municipal industrial trade unions.

	III. Trade union organizations below the county level must be handed over to the county federation of trade unions for unified management and used as working funds for the collective town trade unions and county industry associations under the county federation of trade unions.

	IV. The working funds of the municipal and county federations of trade unions themselves shall not be disbursed from this fund.

	V. The provisions of the first and second paragraphs shall be determined by the local municipal federation of trade unions and the municipal industrial trade union organizations based on the specific circumstances before implementation, and shall be approved by the higher-level trade union organization.

Article 5. The national committees of the eight industrial trade unions of railways, posts and telecommunications, ordnance, textiles, transportation, seafarers, the Yellow River, and coal mines (limited to the three regions of Northeast, North China, and East China) may formulate detailed methods for the collection and expenditure of this administrative or capital side allocation of funds and manage them uniformly.

Article 6. After the promulgation and implementation of these measures, the national committees of the industrial trade unions or the provincial and municipal local trade unions may formulate detailed rules for implementation based on the conditions of the respective industries or localities, and implement them after reporting to and obtaining approval from the higher-level trade union organization.
