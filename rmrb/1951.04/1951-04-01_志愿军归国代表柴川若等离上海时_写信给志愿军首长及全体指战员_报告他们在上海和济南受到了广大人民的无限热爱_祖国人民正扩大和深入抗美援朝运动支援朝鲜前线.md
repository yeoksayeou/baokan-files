　　Volunteer Army Returning Representatives Chai Chuanruo and Others Write to Volunteer Army Leaders and All Commanders and Fighters Upon Leaving Shanghai
    Reporting that They Received the Infinite Love of the Broad Masses of People in Shanghai and Jinan
    The People of the Motherland are Expanding and Deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement to Support the Korean Front
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to Xinhua News Agency: China People's Volunteer Army returning representatives Chai Chuanruo, Dong Lefu, Dou Shaoqi and the other three, wrote a letter to the Volunteer Army leaders and all commanders and fighters upon leaving Shanghai. The original letter is excerpted below:

    To the leaders of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and all commanders and fighters on the Korean Front:

    We, a group of three, left Beijing for East China at 10:00 AM on March 2nd and arrived in Jinan City, the capital of Shandong Province, at 11:00 PM on the night of the 2nd. We gave five reports in Jinan, with an audience of approximately 80,000 people. On the morning of the 6th, we left Jinan and arrived in Shanghai, the largest city in our country and the capital of East China, on the morning of the 7th, and began reporting that afternoon. During our nineteen-day stay in Shanghai, we gave a total of forty-seven reports and met with more than 430,000 people in Shanghai. Including radio listeners and audiences at relay meetings, approximately one million people heard our reports.

    What we saw and heard in Jinan and Shanghai was very exciting. Last December, more than 100,000 students, more than 3,000 teachers from universities and colleges, 123,000 industrialists and businessmen, more than 4,000 relief and welfare organization personnel, and more than 20,000 medical workers in Shanghai held rallies and demonstrations to Resist America, Aid Korea. Three days before our arrival in Shanghai (March 4th), 660,000 workers in Shanghai held a grand parade against the United States arming Japan, and Jinan City also held a parade of 150,000 people on February 18th this year. Representatives from more than forty church schools in Shanghai held patriotic rallies and established the United Association for the Anti-American and Patriotic Movement of Church Schools. After we arrived in Shanghai, we personally witnessed the grand parade of more than 300,000 women compatriots on "March 8th" to oppose the United States arming Japan, and the patriotic demonstration parade of more than 50,000 people from religious circles and former church schools in Shanghai on the 21st.

    The people of the motherland have put their patriotic enthusiasm into their actual actions, and the vast majority of compatriots have signed patriotic covenants, thus closely integrating the great patriotic movement with the current specific tasks of each unit and individual. In the great Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the people of the motherland, like us on the Korean front, are completing their tasks tensely in a fighting posture, creating countless moving examples. Worker brothers and sisters have launched a patriotic production movement, simultaneously improving output and quality, and completing their tasks ahead of schedule. For example, the Shanghai Car Factory increased its daily car production by one times compared to before, and the Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant completed four months' output in three months. In the industrial and commercial sectors, they have also resolutely implemented the "stabilizing the market" and "paying taxes" clauses in their patriotic covenants, and have achieved remarkable results. Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in Shanghai, according to statistics from ten districts, industrialists and businessmen have paid off 64% to 97% of their back taxes, clearing more than 50 billion yuan in back taxes and 2.07 million overdue public bonds.

    The patriotic enthusiasm of the people of the motherland in the great Resist America, Aid Korea movement is also reflected in donations, condolences, and the surging tide of volunteering to go to the Korean front to Resist America, Aid Korea, and in registering to join military cadre schools. According to statistics from the Shanghai branch of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, more than 11.3 billion yuan has been received in consolation money, donations for purchasing bullets, and consolation relief funds, more than 104,000 letters of condolence, and 438 large boxes of condolence items; 1,200 outstanding medical workers have joined the volunteer surgical teams, and 667 patriotic drivers have joined the volunteer transportation teams to Korea; more than 20,000 students and more than 10,000 workers have registered to join military cadre schools. The patriotic movement in religious circles has also developed, especially the number of signatures for the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Christians has increased dramatically. Patriotic people in the Catholic Church have begun to participate in patriotic activities. In addition, since the Central People's Government promulgated the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries," the local people's governments have reversed the original tendency of boundless leniency, resolutely suppressed counterrevolutionary activities, and consolidated the domestic revolutionary order to cooperate with our great victories on the front lines.

    Now our motherland is filled with a new patriotic atmosphere, and the people's patriotic enthusiasm is concretely and centrally expressed in their love and care for us—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. As representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, upon arriving in Jinan and Shanghai, we immediately became the most concerned and loved people by millions of compatriots in these cities. When we arrived in Jinan late at night, we were immediately lifted high by young workers and students who had been waiting for a long time as soon as we got off the platform. When we arrived at the Shanghai Railway Station, the passengers next to the train received the news and automatically gathered to wave and cheer for us. During the nineteen days we gave reports in Shanghai, there were several rainy days, but the reports were not interrupted for even one day due to the rain. Many listeners were so engrossed in our stories of heroic battles that they forgot they were standing in the rain. Many compatriots considered it their supreme honor to shake our hands or get our signatures when they came to listen to our reports. In Jinan and Shanghai for more than twenty days, compatriots from all walks of life were considering one question—how to express their love and patriotic enthusiasm for the Volunteer Army and bring it to the Korean front so that every Volunteer Army comrade would know. At each conference, they gave us many banners, letters of condolence, and condolence items to express their love and gratitude to all our Volunteer Army comrades.

    The people of Shanghai and Jinan also expressed their determination to Resist America, Aid Korea with practical actions, and there are endless examples here. After listening to our reports, the workers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, at a time when the plant was overhauling Boiler No. ×× and Generator No. ××, proposed the slogan: "Generate one more kilowatt of electricity, eliminate one more enemy" to support us. When the overhaul work began on the 15th, the oil depot workers, while working on the oil depot, completed the cold oil machine work, which usually took six people two days to complete, in only six hours with seven people this time, improving efficiency by one and a half times compared to before. The 18th was a Sunday, and more than one hundred workers automatically lined up for voluntary labor. After listening to our reports, the workers of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 created new records.

    The people of Shanghai not only actively support us with production, but also guarantee it by universally signing and implementing patriotic covenants. After listening to the report, the workers of a certain factory all signed their names on the patriotic covenant. Industrialists and businessmen promised to support us by not owing taxes or evading taxes, and students also universally signed patriotic covenants. After listening to our reports, the people of Shanghai immediately launched a further donation campaign to support us. On the 16th, when we broadcasted on the People's Broadcasting Station, the compatriots who listened to the broadcast immediately called or personally ran to the broadcasting station to send their donations. That evening, the statistics reached more than 10 million yuan, and this movement is still continuing to expand widely.

    Dear comrades! When we represented you in giving reports to compatriots in Shanghai and Jinan, every story and every word was not only widely spread among workers and students, but also among neighborhood residents and compatriots from other walks of life. Our victory stories are circulating everywhere in the streets and alleys, thus making everyone's confidence in victory even more firm and further hating the American imperialists. We see that the people of the whole country have further united, and more than 470 million people are standing behind us supporting the front. We see that the power of the Chinese people is great and cannot be defeated. Dear leaders! Comrades! The compatriots of the motherland are looking at us with grateful and proud eyes, blessing our health, and wishing us more victories. Let us first tell you the respect and gratitude of the compatriots in Jinan and Shanghai, East China, wish you good health, wish you eliminate more enemies, and create more glory for our great motherland! With the highest revolutionary salute!

　　志愿军归国代表柴川若等离上海时
    写信给志愿军首长及全体指战员
    报告他们在上海和济南受到了广大人民的无限热爱     
    祖国人民正扩大和深入抗美援朝运动支援朝鲜前线
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：我国人民志愿军归国代表柴川若、董乐辅、窦少毅等三人，在离上海时曾写信给志愿军首长及全体指战员。原信摘要如下：
    朝鲜前线中国人民志愿军首长及全体指战员同志们：
    我们一行三人，于三月二日上午十时离北京来华东，二日夜十一时到达山东省府济南市。在济南共作五次报告，听众约八万余人。六日晨离开了济南，七日上午抵达我国最大的城市、华东首府上海市，当日下午即开始报告。在留沪十九天中，我们共作报告四十七次，和上海市四十三万多人民见了面，连同广播电台的听众和传达会上的听众在内，约有一百万人听到了我们的报告。
    我们在济南和上海二地所见所闻，使我们非常兴奋。去年十二月，上海市十万余学生，三千多大学和专科学校的教师，十二万三千工商业者，四千余救济福利团体人员，二万多医务工作者，都分别举行了抗美援朝的集会和示威游行。在我们来到上海的前三天（三月四日），上海六十六万工人举行了反对美国武装日本大游行，济南市也于今年二月十八日举行了十五万人的大游行。上海市四十多个教会学校代表举行了爱国集会，并成立了教会学校反美爱国运动联合会。我们到上海后，亲眼看见了在“三八”节那一天三十万以上妇女同胞参加的反对美国武装日本大游行，及二十一日上海市宗教界及前教会学校五万余人举行的爱国示威大游行。
    祖国人民更把爱国的热情贯彻到自己的实际行动中去，绝大多数的同胞都已订立了爱国公约，因此就使得伟大的爱国主义运动与每一单位每一个人的当前具体任务紧紧地相结合。在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，祖国人民也和我们在朝鲜前线一样，以战斗的姿态在紧张地完成着自己的任务，创造了说不尽的动人的事例。工人兄弟姊妹们，开展了爱国主义生产运动，产量质量都同时提高，并提前完成了任务。如：上海制车厂每天制车数量较前增加了一倍，上海钢铁厂三个月完成四个月的产量。工商界方面也坚决执行了他们所订的爱国公约中的“稳定市场”及“缴纳捐税”二项规定，并已收到了显著的效果。上海市自抗美援朝运动开展以来，据十个区的统计，工商业者已缴清欠税百分之六十四到百分之九十七，缴清了五百多亿元欠税和二百零七万分尾欠公债。
    祖国人民在伟大的抗美援朝运动中爱国的热情也表现在捐献、慰劳、以及风起云涌地志愿到朝鲜前线去抗美援朝与报名参加军事干部学校方面。据中国人民抗美援朝总会上海分会统计，已收到慰劳金、捐献购买子弹代金及慰劳救济金一百十三亿以上，慰问信十万零四千封以上，慰问品四百三十八大箱；一千二百名优秀的医务工作者参加了志愿手术队，六百六十七名爱国司机参加了志愿赴朝运输队；报名参加军事干部学校者计有学生二万余人，工人万余人。宗教界的爱国运动也有发展，特别是基督教徒三自革新运动的签名人数急剧增加。天主教爱国人士开始参加了爱国的活动。此外，自中央人民政府公布了《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》之后，各地人民政府已扭转了原来宽大无边的偏向，坚决镇压反革命活动，巩固着国内的革命秩序，以与我们前线的伟大胜利相配合。
    现在我们的祖国到处都洋溢着新的爱国主义气氛，人民的爱国热情具体和集中地表现在他们对我们——中国人民志愿部队的热爱和关怀的情感上。作为中国人民志愿部队的代表，到了济南和上海，我们立刻成为这个城市中数百万同胞所最关心和最热爱的人。我们深夜里到达济南时，一出月台就被等候很久的青年工人和学生给高高地举起来。到上海车站时，列车旁边的旅客们得到了消息，自动地集合起来向我们招手欢呼。我们在上海作报告的十九天中曾有几天下雨，可是报告没有因雨而中止过一天，许多听众听我们报告英勇战斗的故事出了神，忘记了自己站着淋雨。许多同胞来听报告的时候都以握一握我们的手或者得到我们签字为他们的无上光荣。在济南和上海二十多天中，各界同胞都在考虑一个问题——如何把他们对志愿军的热爱和爱国热情表示出来，让我们带到朝鲜前线去使每一个志愿军同志都知道。他们在每次大会中，送给了我们许多锦旗、慰问信、慰劳品，以表达对我志愿军全体同志的热爱与感谢。
    上海、济南的人民并以实际行动来表示抗美援朝的决心，这里有说不完的例子。上海电力公司的工友们听了我们的报告后，正值该厂检修××号锅炉和××号发电机，工友们提出：“多发一分电，多消灭一个敌人”的口号来支援我们，十五日检修工作开始，油库工友在油库工作时，冷油机依照向例是六个人做二天才能完成，这一次只由七个人做了六小时便完成了任务，效率比以前提高了一倍半。十八日是星期天，一百多个工友自动地排好队，进行义务劳动。上海钢铁一厂工友听我们的报告回去后，创造了新纪录。
    上海人民不但以积极生产来支援我们，而且还以普遍地订立与执行爱国公约来作保证。某厂工友，听了报告回来后大家都在爱国公约上签了名。工商界保证以不欠税不漏税来支援我们，学生们也普遍订立爱国公约。上海人民在听我们报告后，立即更进一步地开展捐献运动来支援我们，十六日我们在人民广播电台广播时，收听广播的同胞立即纷纷打电话或亲自跑到广播电台来送上自己的献金，当晚统计即达一千余万元，这一运动还在继续广泛地开展中。
    亲爱的同志们！我们代表你们在向上海、济南二地同胞们作报告时，每一个故事每一句话不仅在工人、学生中广泛地传布着，而且在里弄居民及其他各界同胞中也正在传布着，街头巷尾到处在流传着我们的胜利故事，因而使大家的胜利信心更加坚定，更进一步仇恨美帝国主义者。我们看到全国人民已经进一步地团结起来，四亿七千多万人民都站在我们后面支援着前线。我们看到：中国人民的力量是伟大的，不可被战胜的。亲爱的首长们！同志们！祖国同胞都用感激和骄傲的眼光望着我们，为我们的健康祝福，并预祝我们将取得更多的胜利。让我们先把华东的济南、上海二地同胞对我们的敬意和谢意告诉你们，祝你们身体健康，祝你们消灭更多的敌人，为我们伟大的祖国创造更多的光荣！此致崇高的革命敬礼！
