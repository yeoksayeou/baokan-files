　　Volunteer Army Returning Representatives Ji Bingqian and Others Send Letter to Leaders and All Commanders and Fighters on the Korean Front, Reporting on the People of Henan and Xi'an Actively Carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement to Support the Volunteer Army

　　[This Newspaper] The returning representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Ji Bingqian and others, wrote a letter to the leaders and all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army on the Korean front, reporting on the work situation in various parts of Henan and in Xi'an. The original letter is as follows:
To the leaders of the Volunteer Army and all commanders and fighters:
　　We arrived in Kaifeng on the night of March 12th. We worked in Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang for a total of twelve days, giving twenty-two reports to an audience of 150,000 people. When lecturing in Kaifeng, the provincial radio station made a live recording, which was broadcast throughout the city, and Xuchang, Nanyang, and other regions were organized to listen. They also plan to organize farmers in rural areas to listen to the recorded reports in the future. Secondly, when reporting to the Henan Military Region, the military region also made a recording, which they plan to broadcast to the troops in various military sub-districts in the future.
　　The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attached great importance to this work. The Henan Daily specially published an editorial – "Welcome the Great and Glorious Volunteer Army Delegation." When we arrived in Kaifeng, the responsible comrades of the province and city personally went to the station to welcome us, and specially made a float for us.
　　We arrived in Kaifeng in the middle of the night, but the people of the city ran out of their houses to welcome us. National flags were hung everywhere, and firecrackers were set off everywhere, even more lively than the New Year. The elementary school students in Kaifeng were so anxious that they cried because they were not allowed to go to the station, insisting on "seeing the Volunteer Army uncles." Along the way, old ladies and old men scrambled to shake hands with us. Some people didn't wash their hands for several days after shaking hands, and then went to shake hands with their relatives and friends.
　　At the welcome rally, farmers from the suburbs bared their chests and beat dozens of drums to welcome us. Four- and five-year-old children from nurseries danced the Yangko and presented flowers, happily jumping and shouting, "Welcome the Volunteer Army uncles to return victoriously!" "Congratulations to the Volunteer Army uncles for their health!" They also sang: "...Volunteer Army uncles are fighting for us, how can we not thank them? How can we not thank them?" Grandma Hao, 73, Grandma Zhao, 72, and Grandma Li, 67, put big red flowers on us. They handed us the comfort bags they had personally made overnight. They handed us the shoes, sock bottoms, and various daily necessities made by the working women of the city, and told us to take them to the front, telling the comrades at the front not to worry about them, and to eliminate more American bandits. Farmers in the suburbs dedicated the fruits of their hard labor to us: radishes, sweet potatoes, peanuts, candied dates... Yan Jiechen, a labor hero from the Kaifeng Railway East Repair and Assembly Plant, took out the commemorative album given to him by Chairman Mao when he attended the National Labor Model Representative Conference, and asked us to forward it to the combat heroes at the front. After listening to the report, the medical community immediately donated more than 600 penicillin injections and more than 7.3 million yuan in Renminbi. After listening to the report, the workers of the Shanluo section of the railway shed tears. They discussed for a week and prepared to use the report as ideological guidance for 1951, planning to cultivate fifteen model locomotives and seven machine-driver locomotives this year, and complete the task of 500,000 kilometers of safe driving. The workers also donated 685,500 yuan in Renminbi and twenty packs of Labor Model cigarettes to be forwarded to the heroes at the front. Women in the suburbs of Luoyang used 170 kilograms of millet obtained from spinning thread to support the front. Laboring woman Miao Xiuzhen called on female workers to peel four taels more of hemp every day to support the front with processing wages. They have donated 517,000 yuan. Luoyang high school students heard that comrades at the front needed cultural food, and immediately donated more than 3,000 books that day, crowding the Xinhua Bookstore. The bookstore specially extended its working hours by two hours. In Zhengzhou, we participated in the "March 18" workers' demonstration parade and gave a report to more than 50,000 workers. After the meeting, the workers made plans to ensure support for the front and launched in-depth production competitions. Even the nuns sent a representative, Zhu Shushan, to present gifts to us. They said: "In the past, we were backward. In the future, we must do more publicity and participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea work."
　　When we left Kaifeng, more than 70,000 people saw us off, blocking the road. It took more than an hour to get from our residence to the station by car, almost missing the train. Along the way, everyone scrambled to put flowers, diaries, shoes, and various consolation bags into the car. Even a 90-year-old lady who hadn't left her house in twenty years wanted to shake hands. Everyone shouted at the station: "The 32 million people of Henan Province will always be your backing!" The people of Henan love the Volunteer Army and love the motherland so much. We are very touched. We want to bring the enthusiasm of the people of Henan to the front, so that every comrade knows how the people are supporting us.
　　The enthusiasm of the people is not accidental. It has grown on the basis of Resist America, Aid Korea education. When the "Donate a Bullet Movement" was launched this year, the elementary school students in Kaifeng secretly saved their breakfast money to buy bullets. One elementary school student donated four bullets and jumped happily on the desk in the classroom. Some elementary school students were anxious and pouted and cried because their families were poor. During the production competition, 240 labor models emerged from the railway workers in Luoyang. Worker Wu Mingsheng dug soil with his hands in the snow to lift the locomotive, tearing off his fingernails. The porters Fan Laisheng's nose was frostbitten. Everyone told him to rest, but he said: "The comrades at the front are not afraid of wind and snow. What is this to us?" He moved everyone and completed the work task ahead of schedule. Porters Kong Jiu, Li Mingde, and Wu Quanzhang took out 1.3 million yuan to support the Volunteer Army. When mobilizing for enlistment, Lushan County requested 1,000 people, but more than 20,000 people signed up. After hearing the news about joining the military cadre school, Luoyang High School cheered enthusiastically. Within five minutes, two-thirds of the students signed up to join the army. Many model parents also appeared during enlistment. An old man named Guan Xiaojin, who sold noodles, encouraged his son to join the army. He said: "If it weren't for Chairman Mao, there would be no today." He asked both of his sons to join the army. During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, a 56-year-old lady named Wang Lianzhi, with bound feet, publicized the movement everywhere every day, making her throat hoarse. Through her publicity, she raised hundreds of thousands of yuan. People called her the "Iron Feet Propagandist." More than 500 models also appeared in the industrial and commercial circles of Kaifeng during tax payment, and no one wanted to fall behind.
　　The Resist America, Aid Korea work is more specifically reflected in the love for the Volunteer Army. Luoyang has a population of only 120,000 people, but more than 70,000 people welcomed us. They saw the Volunteer Army representatives as if they saw the entire Volunteer Army. The people have boundless love and respect for the Volunteer Army, giving us the highest glory.
　　When we arrived in Xi'an, more than 100,000 people welcomed us. Secretary Xi Zhongxun was very concerned about us and asked us to give a report at the Military and Political Committee (they were holding a meeting of the Military and Political Committee). There were provincial chairmen and committee members, and the report was successful.
　　Our army took the initiative to withdraw from Seoul, and some individuals had some doubts, "thinking that our strength was not enough." In Zhengzhou, we explained that the several battles in Korea were mainly aimed at annihilating the enemy's effective forces. For example, during the first battle, when the enemy ran to Chushan on the Yalu River, I cut off the enemy at Wenjing Yunshan. After annihilating the enemy, the enemy fled to the south of the Qingchuan River. During the second battle, I annihilated the enemy's puppet 7th Division, most of the US 2nd Division, and the Turkish Brigade. Pyongyang fell without being attacked, and the enemy fled to the 38th parallel. During the third battle, our pursuit was also mainly aimed at annihilating the enemy's forces. In the past, the masses only saw us annihilating the enemy while advancing, but this time it was annihilating the enemy by retreating. As long as we explain the past situation clearly, their doubts will be eliminated.
　　In speeches in various places, we first talked about the brutality of the enemy to arouse hatred, explaining that we must resist America and aid Korea in order to defend our homes and defend our country, and that we have no choice but to fight. Then, we introduced to everyone how we fought, explaining whether we could fight. First, we introduced two short stories, such as Zhou Yulin escorting prisoners and Zhang Jinbiao fighting six enemies alone for a day, explaining that we had actual contact with the enemy and knew that the enemy was not terrible. Then, we talked about the heroism and hardship of the Volunteer Army and the support of the Korean people and the people of the motherland. Finally, we talked about the war being long-term and tortuous, as well as the determination and hope of our Volunteer Army. In this way, the confidence of the people in various places in the inevitable victory of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has been further increased.

Respectfully,
Ji Bingqian, Li Weiying, Zhang Fu
April 2nd, in Xi'an

　　志愿军归国代表嵇炳前等致函朝鲜前线首长及全体指战员
    报告河南各地及西安人民积极开展抗美援朝运动支援志愿军
    【本报讯】中国人民志愿军归国代表嵇炳前等，写信给朝鲜前线志愿军首长及全体指战员，报告在河南各地及在西安的工作情况。原信如下：志愿军首长并转全体指战员同志们：
    我们于三月十二日夜到达开封。在开封、郑州、洛阳三地共工作十二天，进行报告二十二次，听众十五万人。在开封讲演时，由省广播电台作实况录音，转播全市，并组织了许昌、南阳等各地专署收听，他们还准备以后到农村去组织农民听录音报告。其次，在河南军区作报告时，亦由军区录音，他们准备以后拿到各军分区去广播给部队听。
    中共河南省委对此次工作极为重视，河南日报特发表了社论——“欢迎伟大光荣的志愿军代表团”。我们到开封时，省市负责同志均亲往车站欢迎，并特为我们做了一辆彩车。
    我们到开封已是半夜，但全市人民却都从屋里跑出来欢迎我们，满街都悬挂国旗，到处都放起鞭炮，比过年还热闹，开封市的小学生因为没有让他们去车站，都急的哭起来，闹着一定“要见见志愿军叔叔们”。一路上，老太太老大爷都争着来和我们握手，有的握了手都几天不洗手，再去转握自己的亲友们。
    在欢迎大会上，郊区的农民裸着胸脯，擂起几十面大鼓欢迎我们。托儿所四、五岁的小宝宝扭起秧歌来献花，他们高兴的蹦着跳着，“欢迎志愿军叔叔胜利归来”。“恭祝志愿军叔叔健康”。他们还唱着：“……志愿军叔叔为我们打仗，我们怎能不感谢？我们怎能不感谢？”七十三岁的郝老大娘，七十二岁的赵大娘，六十七岁的李大娘，她们替我们带上大红花，她们把她们亲自连夜做好的慰问袋交到我们手里，她们把市内劳动妇女做的鞋子、袜底和各种日用品交到我们手里，嘱咐我们带到前方去，她们叫告诉前方同志不要惦着她们，多消灭美国强盗。郊区农民把他们辛劳得来的劳动果实献给我们，萝卜、地瓜、花生、焦枣……。开封铁路东修配厂劳动英雄严洁忱，拿出他在出席全国劳动模范代表会议时毛主席送给他的纪念册，托我们转送给前线的战斗英雄。医药界听了报告以后，即捐献出盘尼西林六百余支和人民币七百三十余万元。陕洛段铁路工人听了报告，很多人都流了眼泪，他们讨论了一个星期，准备作一九五一年思想指导，准备今年培养十五台模范机车和七台机干车，完成五十万公里安全行车任务。工人们并献出人民币六十八万五千五百元，和二十条劳动模范烟，托转赠前线英雄。洛阳郊区妇女用纺线得来的一百七十斤小米，支援前方。劳动妇女苗秀贞号召女工每天多剥四两麻，以加工工资支援前方，她们已捐出五十一万七千元。洛阳高中学生听到前方同志需要文化食粮，当天即献书三千余册，把新华书店都挤满了，书店特地延长了两小时工作时间。在郑州我们参加“三一八”工人示威大游行，给五万多工人做了报告，会后工人纷纷订计划保证支援前线，深入展开生产竞赛。连修道女也派代表朱淑善向我们献礼，她们说：“过去我们落后，今后我们要多宣传，参加抗美援朝工作。”
    在我们离开开封时，七万多群众欢送，把路都堵住了。从住地坐汽车走到车站费了一点多钟，几乎误了火车。一路上大家争着把鲜花、日记本、鞋子和各种慰劳袋塞到车上来，连九十多岁，二十年不出门的老太太也要握握手，大家在车站上高呼：“河南省三千二百万人民永远做你们的后盾！”   河南的人民这样热爱志愿军，热爱祖国，我们太感动了，我们要把河南人民的热情带到前方去，要使每个同志都知道人民怎样在支援我们。
    人民的热情，不是偶然的，是在抗美援朝教育基础上生长起来的，在今年新年发起“捐献一粒子弹运动”的时候，开封市小学生偷偷的把早点费节省下来买子弹，有一位小学生捐了四粒子弹，他高兴的爬在课堂的桌子上跳起来。有的小学生因为家里穷，急的噘起嘴，哭起来。洛阳铁路工人在生产竞赛中涌现出二百四十名劳动模范，工人吴明生在雪地里用手挖土抬机车，把指甲都挖掉了。搬运工人范来生鼻子冻坏了，大家叫他休息，他说：“前线同志不怕风不怕雪，我们这算什么？”感动了大家，提前完成了工作任务。搬运工人孔九、李明德、武权章拿出一百三十万元支援志愿军。在动员参军时鲁山县要求一千名，但报名的有两万多。洛阳高中听了参加军事干部学校的消息后，热烈欢呼，五分钟内报名参军的即达全校同学三分之二。参军中还出现了不少模范家长，有一位卖面的关孝金老大爷鼓励他儿子参军，他说：“不是毛主席，那有今天。”他叫两个儿子都参军。在抗美援朝运动中，有一位五十六岁的王莲芝老大娘，她是小脚，但她每天到处宣传，喉咙都说哑了。经过她宣传，募集了数十万元。人们称她为“铁脚宣传员”。开封市的工商界也在纳税中出现五百多位模范，谁也不愿落后。
    抗美援朝工作更具体的表现在对志愿军的爱护，洛阳全市不过十二万人，欢迎我们的即达七万余人，他们看到了志愿军代表，就像看到了全体志愿军，人民对志愿军是无比的热爱和崇敬，给我们最高的光荣。
    我们到西安时，有十万余人欢迎，习仲勋书记对我们极关心，要我们在军政委员会作了一次报告（他们正开军政委员会），有各省主席及委员，报告的结果还成功。
    我军主动撤出汉城，个别人有些怀疑，“认为我们力量还不够”，在郑州时，我们说明在朝作战几次战役均以歼灭敌人有生力量为主，如第一次敌跑到鸭绿江边楚山，我在温井云山将敌切断，歼敌后，敌逃往清川江南。二次战役我歼敌伪七师，美军二师大部及土耳其旅后，平壤不攻自破，敌逃到三八线。三次战役我追击亦以歼敌力量为主。群众过去只看到我们在前进中消灭敌人，但这次是后撤歼灭敌人，只要我们把过去情况讲清楚，他们怀疑就消除了。
    在各地讲话中，我们先讲敌人残暴，激起仇恨，说明要保家卫国一定要抗美援朝，说明我们不能不打。然后向大家介绍怎样打的，说明我们能不能打。先介绍两个小故事，如周玉林送俘虏，张金彪一个人和六个敌人打一天等，说明我们和敌人实际接触，知道敌人并不可怕。然后讲了志愿部队的英勇艰苦，讲了朝鲜人民与祖国人民的支援。最后讲战争是长期的曲折的，及我们志愿军的决心和希望。这样，就更增加了各地人民对于抗美援朝必然胜利的信心。专此  致以敬礼
        嵇炳前  李维英  张甫
                四月二日于西安
