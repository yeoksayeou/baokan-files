How does the Beijing China People's Printing Factory conduct "signatures" and "votes"?
    Jin Feng
    The Beijing China People's Printing Factory, with over two thousand employees, held a meeting on April 21 to denounce the atrocities of the Japanese invaders. When worker Zhang Wenqi recounted how he was captured by the Japanese invaders as a forced laborer in a coal mine and was so hungry that he cut flesh from his own thigh to eat, and worker Peng Cuirong denounced the crime of the Japanese invaders cutting off her father's ear and forcing him to eat it, the entire workforce wept. They unanimously raised their hands, voted against the United States arming Japan, and signed in support of the conclusion of a five-power peace pact. They understood that only by firmly grasping the cause of opposing American imperialist aggression and defending world peace in their own hands could they forever avoid suffering such disasters again. Immediately following the denunciation, signing, and voting, the entire factory formulated a patriotic pact, and then further launched a patriotic production competition, forming a new upsurge of anti-American and patriotic sentiment among all employees.
    The reason why the signing and voting work of the China People's Printing Factory played a driving role in promoting production is inseparable from the factory's leading cadres focusing their efforts on conducting education on resisting America and aiding Korea. From the beginning to the middle of April, the entire factory launched a political study centered on resisting America and aiding Korea, linking it to the Labor Insurance Regulations and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries documents. During discussions, the workers all said: To protect the fruits of the revolutionary victory of the Labor Insurance Regulations, we must step up our efforts to resist America and aid Korea. They said: The volunteers are shedding blood and sweat on the front lines, and we are still enjoying labor insurance in the rear; if we don't resist America and aid Korea and step up production, how can we be worthy of the volunteers on the front lines!
    The factory also promptly solved the problem of combining the specific work of registering labor insurance cards with resisting America and aiding Korea, preparing for the denunciation, signing, and voting meeting. Some cadres in the factory initially thought that the two were contradictory. Their reasoning was: labor insurance card registration is technical work, and the content is very complex. Each worker has to fill in many items on the card, such as general seniority, enterprise seniority, direct relatives, dependent relatives, etc. They believed that these could not be carried out simultaneously with the anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda. They proposed to use a week to specifically carry out the card registration work. This would inevitably interrupt the factory's anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda for a week, repeating the past mistake of the anti-American and aid-Korea movement being disconnected from the central work, and therefore being cold and hot by turns. Another group of cadres in the factory, however, believed that the two must be combined and could be combined. They pointed out that only by continuing to carry out anti-American and aid-Korea education and improving the political consciousness of employees can signing and voting have substantial content, and registration work can be done more accurately. The factory's Chinese Communist Party Committee affirmed the latter view, and the cadres distributed themselves among the masses and obtained confirmation from practice and experience.
    Workers carried out card registration by means of self-reporting history (including seniority, factory seniority, family property, etc.) and group meetings to discuss the extent to which they enjoyed labor insurance benefits. When they self-reported their history, recalling their painful lives under the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries, small-scale grievance meetings naturally formed. Cadres enlightened them and guided them to hate American imperialism, which conspired to arm Japan and support the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits. The workers then proposed "to do a good job in registering labor insurance cards while doing a good job in resisting America and aiding Korea." Those workers who had concealed their history, age, or property in the past in order to cope with the reactionary rulers all revealed the truth. This experience was immediately promoted throughout the factory. In general, registration was no longer done in a question-and-answer format, but rather focused on recalling and complaining. This on the one hand prepared for the denunciation, signing, and voting meeting, and on the other hand promoted the registration work.
    In addition to carrying out general anti-American and aid-Korea education, the factory also conducted special education on "signing" and "voting" to make the masses fully aware of the significance and importance of this political movement. Initially, many employees in the factory quite generally believed that "signing and voting are useless and impractical"; and some people believed that Japan would not be armed anyway, so there was no need to vote against it. In response to these ideas, the reporter of the Chinese Communist Party in the factory explained the various facts of American imperialism's conspiracy to arm Japan and invade China, and emphasized that the Chinese people needed to unite with the people of Japan, Asia, and the world to defeat the shameless conspiracy of American imperialism. The reporter also exposed the despicable acts of American imperialism in fearing the power of the people, attempting to undermine and suppress the peace movement, and deceiving and蒙蔽the people. During group discussions, the workers talked about the various facts of how the American and Chiang bandits deceived and蒙蔽them before liberation, and slandered the people's revolutionary movement led by the Chinese Communist Party. They said: "The American devils say all the nice things but do all the bad things, they are simply the ancestors of Chiang Kai-shek!" "Signing and voting is to peel off the skin of this old fox!" "Workers of the world are one family, and the common people of the world are also one family; everyone signs and votes to oppose this ambitious wolf!"
    After this series of propaganda, education, brewing, and discussion, the denunciation, signing, and voting meeting of the China People's Printing Factory aroused the employees' anti-American sentiment and their will to defend the motherland and defend peace. The reason why signing and voting based on denunciation is powerful is because, through denunciation, this political movement of opposing the United States arming Japan and supporting the conclusion of a five-power peace pact is inextricably linked to the vital interests of the employees. Their patriotic enthusiasm has greatly increased. The formulation of a patriotic pact by the entire factory has become a powerful step for them to consolidate their patriotic sentiment and turn to practical action. The employees discussed and passed the patriotic pact extremely seriously. They always said: We have signed and voted, and we must contribute actual strength. According to a survey, the factory's production has been initially improved so far: 48 outside line workers in the machine affairs section have completed the work of 100 people; the error rate in the sealing and packaging section has been reduced by 75%; and Wang Haifeng, a worker in the machine affairs section, completed half a month's production tasks in eight days. The employees of the entire factory are full of confidence and will greet the May Day demonstration with new achievements in their respective positions.

　　北京中国人民印刷厂是怎样进行“签名”、“投票”的？
    金凤
    北京中国人民印刷厂二千多职工，在四月二十一日集会控诉日寇暴行。当工人张文起控诉他被日寇抓劳工下到煤窑，饿得他割自己大腿的肉充饥，工人彭翠荣控诉日寇割下她父亲的耳朵，还强迫她父亲把耳朵吃下去的罪行时，全场工人哭成一片。他们一致举手，投票反对美国武装日本，签名拥护缔结五大国和平公约。他们明白：只有将反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的事业紧紧掌握在自己手里，才能永远不再遭受那样的灾难。紧接着，在控诉、签名、投票的基础上，全厂订立了爱国公约，接着即进一步展开爱国主义生产竞赛，形成了全厂职工反美爱国的新高潮。
    中国人民印刷厂的签名、投票工作所以发挥了推进生产的动力作用，是与该厂领导干部集中力量进行抗美援朝教育分不开的。从四月初到四月中，全厂展开了以抗美援朝为中心、联系劳动保险条例、镇压反革命文件的时事政治学习。工人们在讨论时都说：要保卫劳动保险条例这个革命胜利的果实，就要加紧抗美援朝。他们说：志愿军在前方流血流汗，我们在后方还享受劳动保险；要不抗美援朝，加紧生产，怎么对得起前方的志愿军！
    该厂又及时地解决了劳动保险卡片登记的具体工作与抗美援朝相结合的问题，为控诉、签名、投票大会作了准备。该厂一部分干部在最初认为二者是有矛盾的。他们的理由是：劳动保险卡片登记是技术性工作，内容十分复杂。每个工人都要在卡片上填写许多项目，例如一般工龄、企业工龄、直系亲属、供养亲属等等。他们认为这些是无法和抗美援朝宣传同时进行的。他们提出要用一个星期来专门进行卡片登记工作。这样一来，势必将使该厂的抗美援朝宣传中断一个星期，重蹈过去抗美援朝运动与中心工作脱节、因而时冷时热的复辙。厂里的另一部分干部，却认为二者必须结合也能够结合。他们指出：只有继续进行抗美援朝教育，提高职工的政治觉悟，签名、投票才有充实内容，登记工作也能做得更确实。该厂中共党委会肯定了后面的意见，干部们分布到群众中去，从实践和经验中取得了证实。
    工人们进行卡片登记，是采取自报历史（包括工龄、厂龄、家庭财产等）、小组会议讨论享受劳动保险待遇的程度的办法。他们在自报历史时，回忆到在日寇、国民党反动统治时的痛苦生活，自然形成了小型诉苦会。干部从中启发，引导他们仇恨阴谋武装日本、支持国民党匪帮残余的美帝国主义。工人们就提出“要在做好抗美援朝的工作中做好劳动保险卡片登记”。那些过去因为要应付反动统治者而隐瞒历史、年龄或财产的工人，都纷纷说出了真实情况。这一经验立即推广到全厂。登记时一般不再作一问一答式的记录，而是有重点地回忆、诉苦。这就一方面为控诉、签名、投票大会作了准备工作，另一方面又推进了登记工作。
    该厂除了进行一般的抗美援朝教育外，还特别进行了关于“签名”“投票”的教育，使群众充分认识这一政治运动的意义和重要。厂中许多职工中最初相当普遍地认为“签名、投票不顶用，不实际”；又有些人认为横竖日本武装不起来，不必投票反对。该厂中国共产党的报告员针对这些思想，说明美帝国主义阴谋武装日本、进攻中国的种种事实，并着重说明中国人民需要和日本、亚洲、全世界人民团结起来，击破美帝国主义的无耻阴谋。报告员又揭露了美帝国主义惧怕人民力量，企图破坏、压制和平运动，欺骗、蒙蔽人民的卑劣勾当。小组讨论时，工人们就纷纷谈论起解放前美蒋匪帮欺骗、蒙蔽他们，诬蔑中国共产党所领导的人民革命运动的种种事实。他们说：“美国鬼子好话说尽，坏事做绝，简直是蒋介石的老祖宗！”“签名、投票就是要揭去这只老狐狸的皮！”“全世界工人是一家，全世界老百姓也是一家；大家都签名、投票，反对这只野心狼！”
    经过这一连串的宣传教育和酝酿、讨论，中国人民印刷厂的控诉、签名、投票大会，就激发了职工的仇美情绪和保卫祖国、保卫和平的意志。在控诉基础上进行签名、投票之所以有力量，就是因为通过控诉，将反对美国武装日本、拥护缔结五大国和平公约这一政治运动，和职工群众的切身利益血肉相关地联结了起来。他们的爱国情绪，大为高涨。全厂订立爱国公约，更成为他们巩固爱国情绪、转入实际行动的有力步骤。职工们都极其认真地逐条讨论和通过爱国公约。他们总是说：我们签了名、投了票，我们一定要拿出实际力量来。据调查，该厂生产到现在止已有了初步的改进：机务股外线工人四十八人，做完一百人的工作；封包股减少差错百分之七十五；机务股工人王海峰，八天完成了半个月的生产任务。全厂职工充满信心，要在各个岗位上以新的成就来迎接五一大示威。
