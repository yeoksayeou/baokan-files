　　The Most Precious Souvenir!
　  Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean Front Receive Comfort Bags from the Hungarian People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 5th] The comfort bags sent by the Hungarian people to the Chinese People's Volunteers have been delivered to the hands of the volunteer soldiers on the Korean front. With excitement and gratitude, the volunteer soldiers opened these comfort bags from tens of thousands of miles away. They stroked the cigarettes, canned goods, sugar cubes, soap, needles, thread, and safety pins inside the bags, reluctant to use these gifts. Some soldiers said, "I want to keep it forever as the most precious souvenir." Some said, "I want to keep it in my arms so that I can feel the great friendship of the people of brotherly countries at all times." Another soldier said, "The comfort bags sent by the Hungarian people are valuable and full of affection." After receiving the comfort bags, many soldiers immediately took advantage of the lulls in battle to write letters to the Hungarian people, telling them about how they defeated the American cannibalistic barbarians, and expressed their determination to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors and defend lasting peace in the Far East and the world, in order to repay their profound kindness.

　  朝鲜前线我志愿军接到匈人民慰问袋
    【新华社朝鲜前线五日电】匈牙利人民送给中国人民志愿军的慰问袋，已经运到朝鲜前线的志愿军战士们的手中。志愿军战士们怀着兴奋和感谢的心情，拆开这些来自万里以外的慰问袋。他们抚摸着装在袋里的香烟、罐头、方糖、肥皂、针、线、扣针，舍不得动用这些礼物。有的战士说：“我要永远把它保存起来，当作最珍贵的纪念品。”有的说：“我要把它揣在怀里，让我时时刻刻感受到兄弟国家的人民的伟大友情。”另有一个战士说：“匈牙利人民送给我们的慰问袋礼重情重。”很多战士在收到慰问袋后，立刻利用战斗空隙写信给匈牙利人民，把自己打败美国吃人生番的情形告诉他们，并且表示决以彻底打败美国侵略军，保卫远东和世界的持久和平，来答谢他们的隆情厚意。
