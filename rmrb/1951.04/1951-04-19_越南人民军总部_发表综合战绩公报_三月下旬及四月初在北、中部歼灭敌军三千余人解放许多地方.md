Xinhua News Agency, Eighteenth Dispatch: According to a dispatch from the Vietnam News Agency on the 14th, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army issued a communique on April 7th, summarizing the battle achievements of the People's Army in the Dong Trieu mining area of North Vietnam, Shanxi Province, and the Central Vietnam region in late March and early April.

The communique stated: To celebrate the founding of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Viet Minh Front, the Vietnam People's Army launched a series of attacks on the French army's defense lines in North and Central Vietnam, achieving great victories. In less than a month, the People's Army eliminated more than 3,000 enemy troops, seized a large number of weapons and ammunition, and liberated a large part of the Dong Trieu mining area north of Haiphong.

In the Dong Trieu and Hong Gai mining areas of North Vietnam, on Highway 18, and between Haiphong and Hanoi, the People's Army and local forces, in twelve days of combat, removed 23 enemy strongholds, killing and wounding a total of 1,225 enemy troops, capturing 195 prisoners, and liberating most of the coastal coal mining areas from Mao Khe to An Li and from Yanzi Mountain to the vicinity of Quang Yen. The captured spoils included: 10 mortars, 79 machine guns of various types, 250 rifles, 11 radio transmitters and generators, and 4 trucks, and 9 tons of ammunition. The People's Army destroyed 7 enemy trucks, 1 tank, 3 armored vehicles, 3 field guns, and a large number of other weapons. The People's Army also shot down an enemy fighter plane.

In this campaign, the Vietnamese people greatly helped and contributed to the victory of the People's Army. Especially in the war zone, the mobilization of manpower and materials exceeded the predetermined targets.

In the Shanxi Province war zone, the People's Army removed 7 enemy strongholds and recovered 1 stronghold between March 25th and 31st, killing and wounding 120 enemy troops, capturing 85 prisoners, and seizing more than 100 rifles, 2 light machine guns, and 3 submachine guns.

In the Guangping, Guangzhi, and Thua Thien regions of Central Vietnam, the People's Army removed the Bo Lai French army stronghold north of Thua Thien Province, annihilating 120 enemy troops. The People's Army then engaged in mobile warfare with eight enemy battalions (one battalion of North African troops, three battalions of the Foreign Legion, and four motorized battalions) attempting to invade the area between Thua Thien and Guangzhi provinces. After three days of fierce fighting, the People's Army annihilated this enemy force, capturing French commander Major Lanbao and the entire headquarters staff, including many French lieutenants and six Bao Dai puppet army officers.

The communique concluded: In these battles, many units of the People's Army have made meritorious contributions, and the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army has issued orders to commend them.
