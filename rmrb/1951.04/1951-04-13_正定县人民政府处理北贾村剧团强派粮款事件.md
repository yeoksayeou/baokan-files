Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily

    To the Editor:
    Your newspaper published a "Reader's Letter" on January 31st criticizing the Beijia Village Troupe in Zhengding County for improperly levying grain funds from the masses. The facts are completely correct. Because this matter involved a wide range of people, we handled it cautiously, which caused a delay. The investigation and handling results are summarized as follows:
    Mao Changming (middle peasant), a village cadre in Beijia Village, conceived the idea of establishing a village troupe after watching a play in Yong'an Village last Lunar New Year. He contacted Wang Duofu, Wang Dejun, and 36 others to plan the troupe, with expenses to be levied from wealthier households in the village. After the District People's Government discovered and stopped this, he feigned compliance but secretly continued to collect funds at night in groups, totaling 9,670,400 yuan. They went to Beijing and Shijiazhuang to buy costumes, paid two teachers' salaries (the reader said one), and covered miscellaneous expenses, leaving only 6,800 yuan.
    We believe that: Village cadre Mao Changming's unauthorized levy of funds from the masses is an act of undermining the state's financial system; his lack of concern for the people's livelihood and his forceful levy fully demonstrate his weak mass perspective; his disregard for the superior government and the law by feigning compliance after being stopped by the higher-level government is even more egregious. Therefore, his position has been revoked, and he has been sent to the People's Court to be sentenced to one year of imprisonment to educate him. Others involved in the matter have been treated leniently and have been educated and released. Furthermore, the village troupe has been ordered to temporarily suspend activities, pending review and approval by the county; the costumes, etc., will be kept in the custody of the village office. The details of the levied grain funds and expenditures will be listed and submitted for review by the masses, and the 220 catties of grain wages for digging the river will be returned to the masses.

### 正定县人民政府处理北贾村剧团强派粮款事件

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    正定县人民政府处理北贾村剧团强派粮款事件编辑同志：
    一月三十一日贵报“读者来信”刊载了正定县北贾村剧团不应向群众强派粮款的批评。事实完全正确。因为这件事情牵连面较广，为慎重处理，所以拖延了一个时期。现将调查情况及处理结果综述如下：
    北贾村村干部毛常明（中农），去年阴历正月从永安村看戏回来，就酝酿成立村剧团。他前后联络王度福、王德俊等三十八个人来筹划，其经费由村中花户派敛。经区人民政府发觉制止后，他却阳奉阴违，偷偷地在夜间分组分片催敛款项，先后共敛到九百六十七万零四百元。他们曾到北京、石家庄买戏装，付教师二人（读者说的是一人）薪资及杂支等项外，仅余六千八百元。
    我们认为：村干部毛常明擅自向群众派款，是破坏国家财政制度的行为；不关心群众生活，强派硬敛，十足表现了群众观点薄弱；既经上级政府制止，不知悔改，反而阳奉阴违，更是目无上级政府、目无法纪的行为。为此，撤销其职务，并送人民法院依法判处有期徒刑一年，以资教育。其他参与其事者，从宽处理，已予教育释放。并令该村剧团暂时停止活动，等候县审查批示；戏装等由村公所保管。关于所派粮款及开支情形，即开具清单交群众审查，并将挖河工资米二百二十斤退还群众。
