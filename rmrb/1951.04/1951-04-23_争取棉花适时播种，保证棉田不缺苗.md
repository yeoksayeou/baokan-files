Strive for Timely Cotton Sowing and Ensure No Missing Seedlings in Cotton Fields
	Chen Ren Xu Jingzhong
	Timely sowing and ensuring no missing seedlings in cotton fields are fundamental conditions for a bumper harvest. In the main cotton-growing areas of the country, the sowing period mostly falls within one month before and after Grain Rain (around April 20th) and Start of Summer (around May 5th), but in some areas the sowing period is even shorter. Grain Rain has already arrived, so how to seize the time, sow in a timely manner, and ensure a full stand of seedlings to lay the foundation for a bumper cotton harvest this year is the most important issue currently facing governments at all levels and agricultural production leading organs.
	Ensuring timely cotton sowing must be closely combined with techniques to guarantee a full stand of seedlings. Sowing is not just a matter of planting cotton seeds; it must ensure complete emergence to be considered a completed sowing task. Last year, most provinces exceeded their cotton sowing plans, but some areas did not pay enough attention to seedling protection work, resulting in many missing seedlings. This year, we should learn from this experience and pay special attention to sowing and seedling protection techniques.
	First, after deep plowing and fine harrowing of cotton fields, they should be harrowed and covered after each rain to loosen the soil and retain moisture so that cotton buds can easily extend their roots and emerge from the soil.
	Second, conduct seed selection and germination tests. Use neat, plump cotton seeds with a high germination rate (should be above 85 percent, the higher the better) as seed. If the cotton seed germination rate is low, the sowing amount should be increased accordingly. Cotton seeds with a germination rate below 60 percent are best not used.
	Third, scald the seeds with boiling water before sowing. First, moisten ten catties of cotton seeds in cold water (add about five catties of water), then pour in thirty catties of boiling water (just enough to cover the cotton seeds), and stir immediately to make the temperature uniform. Stop stirring when the temperature is no longer hot to the touch, cover, and let the water temperature slowly decrease. Take the cotton seeds out after soaking in the water overnight. After scalding, carry out germination and seed mixing work. In areas with severe seedling blight, use mercury preparations to mix the seeds. This will not only promote germination, rapid and complete emergence, but also kill germs and eliminate diseased seedlings. In areas with many underground insects such as cutworms and mole crickets, pay more attention to preventing and controlling insect pests after sowing.
	Fourth, master the appropriate sowing time and sowing depth. The sowing time of cotton should not be too early, because early sowing is prone to frost damage, failure to emerge, or slow cotton seed germination and weak seedlings, which are prone to diseases. Last year, some places in North China were rained on earlier and sowed in early April, resulting in frost damage in some areas. The so-called appropriate sowing time is when the temperature warms up and is unlikely to turn cold again. If the temperature is not high enough, do not rush to sow early. However, when the temperature has warmed up, timely sowing is required without delay. Because late sowing prevents normal development of cotton plants, delays maturity, and inevitably reduces yield. Sowing depth should be adapted to local conditions. The farming proverb says, "Too deep, it ferments; too shallow, it blows away," meaning that if the seeds are planted too deep, they may rot and fail to germinate; but if they are too shallow, they are easily blown away by the wind. In general, cotton sowing should be shallow rather than deep. In moist soil, sowing at a depth of three or four fen is sufficient. In drier soil, sowing can be deeper, but not more than two inches. After sowing and covering the soil, compression is necessary, especially for sandy soils. Planting cotton in saline-alkali land is most likely to result in missing seedlings, and sowing techniques are even more important. According to the experience of the masses in the Tangshan area, for lightly alkaline land, the topsoil should be fine and the bottom of the sowing ditch should be smooth, the covering soil should be deep, and it must be tightly compressed so that the seeds can absorb water. For heavily alkaline land, the soil surface should not be too fine to avoid moisture retention and adhesion, which will affect emergence. It is best to expose the furrow to the sun for one or two days to increase soil temperature. The bottom of the ditch should have some loose soil to reduce capillary action. Sowing and covering soil should be shallower, and only slightly compressed. After sowing in saline-alkali land, some cover a thin layer of grass on the soil surface to prevent salt from rising and increase the survival rate of seedlings. In addition, heavily alkaline land should generally be sown later, the sowing amount should be increased, and the seed mixing should use fine sandy soil instead of grass ash.
	Fifth, this spring, some dry land may be affected by lack of rain and affect cotton planting. These areas should immediately implement drought-resistant sowing methods. Local leading organs should promptly mobilize farmers to dig soil wells, or draw water from neighboring canals and wells to water and sow. Although this requires more labor, it is indeed the best way to ensure timely sowing, and efforts should be made to implement it when necessary. The masses have many valuable experiences in drought-resistant sowing, and leading organs should pay attention to introducing and promoting them: such as the "dry hoeing and wet planting method" - if the topsoil is dry, but the soil below is moist, a hoe can be used to open a ditch, push away a layer of topsoil, and sow in the moist soil. This method is also called the cover sowing method. Or use a single-foot hoe for deep sowing. After a few days, after the cotton seeds sprout in the soil, push away a ditch on the top layer of the sowing row, and the cotton seedlings can grow smoothly. Another example is the "local soil method" - in the land where the soil moisture is barely enough and the wet soil is relatively deep, dig deep holes to sow and dig another hole next to it, take out the wet soil to cover to increase the moisture needed for cotton seed germination. There are also those who use iron hoes to dig a slanted pit when sowing drought-resistant seeds, so that the seeds are distributed in a slanted layer, with different depths, and the degree of moisture in the soil layer they contact is different, which can increase the chances of emergence. If you are not sure about emergence, when you take the risk of sowing, use half soaked wet seeds and half dry seeds to sow together. If the soil moisture is barely enough, the wet seeds can emerge; if the soil moisture is not enough, the other half of the dry seeds can continue to emerge to reduce the risk of missing seedlings. After drought-resistant sowing and emergence, if the drought continues, some use small iron rods to insert several holes diagonally next to the seedlings, pour water sideways with a kettle, fill the holes and seal them, and hoe once. This saves water and is drought-resistant for a long time.
	Sixth, after the cotton seeds are sown, always check the emergence situation in the field, and check the changes of the cotton seeds in the soil. If it is found that the soaking is bad or the sowing technology is not good, and there is no hope of emergence, or the seedlings are frozen to death, diseased to death, or killed by wind and sand after emergence, they should be resown as soon as possible. If the cotton seeds in the soil germinate well and have not yet emerged from the ground, but suddenly encounter heavy rain, after the rain, the field surface often forms a layer of dry and hard mud, and the cotton buds are unable to break through. You can use a toothed harrow to lightly harrow in a direction different from the sowing row to help them emerge. After emergence, if it rains, hoe the land to remove weeds once after the rain. The technique of thinning seedlings after emergence is also very important. Thinning seedlings is best done in two or three times. "Thin seedlings early, densely leave seedlings, and fix seedlings late", "Thin leaves dense (meaning to remove less), dense leaves thin, and leave the larger ones if they are not sparse or dense" are the general tips for thinning seedlings. The fixing of seedlings in alkaline land should be later.
	Seventh, if the cotton seedlings do not emerge neatly, the same variety of cotton seeds should be used to replant in time. If the sowing time has passed, or there is a lack of seedlings due to diseases and insect pests, seedling transplantation can be carried out. The method of seedling transplantation is to fully water the cotton seedlings to be transplanted first (no need to water in shady and wet places or after rain). After the water penetrates, use a shovel to shovel out the seedlings with the soil (the soil block is about three inches square and five inches deep, do not break the soil block and expose the cotton roots), move them into the pre-dug pits for missing seedlings, pile soil around them, and then water them. Seedling transplantation is best done when there are true leaves. Transplantation on cloudy days is even better. The survival rate of seedling transplantation can generally reach more than 90 percent, and the development and yield of cotton seedlings are almost the same as those of the original sowing.

　　争取棉花适时播种，保证棉田不缺苗
    陈仁　许警众
    棉花的适时播种和保证棉田不缺苗，是丰收的基本条件。全国主要棉区的播种期，多在谷雨与立夏前后一个月内，但有些地区的播种期，时间更短。目前谷雨已届，因此如何抓紧时间，适时播种和保证全苗，以打下今年棉产丰收的基础，是当前各级人民政府及农业生产领导机关上的最重要的问题。
    保证棉花播种适时，必须和保证全苗的技术密切结合起来。因为播种不只是将棉籽种下即算了事，必须保证出苗齐全，才算完成了播种任务。去年大部省份都超额完成了棉花播种计划，但个别地区对保苗工作重视不够，因而发生了不少缺苗现象。今年我们应该接受这一经验教训，在播种保苗的技术上，特别加以重视。
    第一、棉田经过深耕细耙，每次雨后，还要加以耙盖，使土粒松细，保持水分，以便棉芽容易伸根出土。
    第二、进行粒选棉种和发芽试验。用整齐饱满，发芽率高（应在百分之八十五以上，越高越好）的棉籽做种。棉籽发芽率若低，则须酌量增加播种量。发芽率在百分之六十以下的棉种最好不用。
    第三、播种前实行开水烫种。把十斤棉籽先在凉水中润湿（约加水五斤）然后倒入三十斤的开水（水刚好盖过棉籽），随即搅拌，使温度均一，至温度不烫手时，停止搅拌，加盖，让水温慢慢降低。棉籽在水中过夜后再取出。烫种后再进行催芽和拌种工作。立枯病严重的地区，要用汞制剂拌种。如此不仅能促进发芽，出苗迅速齐全，且有杀死病菌，免除病苗的效能。在地老虎和蝼蛄等地下虫较多的地方，播种后更要注意防除虫害。
    第四、掌握适当的播种时期和播种深度。棉花播种的时期，不能太提前，因播种太早，易受冻害，出不了苗，或棉籽发芽迟缓、苗弱，易生病害。去年华北有些地方因得雨较早在四月中旬以前就播了种，以致有些地方受到冻害。所谓播种的适当时期，就是在气温转暖，不致再转冷的时候。如果气温不够，不可抢雨早播。但气温已经转暖时，则须及时播种，不必拖延等雨。因为播种晚了，棉株不能正常发育，并延迟成熟，产量必然降低。播种深度要因地制宜，农谚说：“深了酵浅了飘”，意思是若播种入土太深，则恐棉籽霉烂，不能发芽出土；但若太浅，则又易被风吹去。在一般情况下，棉花播种宜浅不宜深。湿土播三、四分即可。较干燥的土质，播种可较深一些，但也不要超过两寸。播种覆土后，要加镇压，特别是带砂性的土壤。盐碱地植棉，最容易缺苗，播种技术更加重要。据唐山一带群众的经验，碱轻的土地，表土要细碎，下种的沟底面要光，覆土要深，并须严密镇压，以便种子吸收水分。盐碱重的土地，土面不宜太细碎，以免返潮粘结，影响出苗。耠出沟，来最好先晒一、二天，以增加土温。沟底要有些浮土，减少毛细管上升作用。播种覆土要浅些，稍加镇压即可。盐碱地播种后，有些在土面上盖一层薄草，以防止盐分上升，增加幼苗的成活率。此外，碱重地一般应播种晚些，播种量要多些，拌种要用细砂土，不可用草木灰。
    第五、今年春播期间部分旱地可能因缺雨而影响种棉。这些地方应即实行抗旱播种法。当地领导机关应及时动员农民开挖土井，或引借邻近的渠水井水，挑水点播。这样虽然费工较多，但确是保证及时播种的最好方法，在必要时应努力实行。群众里面，有许多宝贵的抗旱播种经验，领导机关应注意介绍推广：如“豁干耩湿法”——表土虽干，而下面土壤湿润的，可用耠子开沟，推开一层表土，在湿润土壤里播种，这种方法又叫做套耧法。或用独脚耧深播，过几天棉籽在土里露芽后，再在播种行上层，推开一条沟，棉苗便能顺利长出。又如“客土法”——在土壤湿度勉强够，而湿土也比较深的地里，挖深穴点播，并在旁边另挖一穴，取出其中的湿土来覆盖，以增加棉籽发芽所需的水分。还有在抗旱点播时，用铁铣挖一斜坑，使点入的种子，分布成一斜层，深浅都有，所接触土层的湿润程度不同，可增加出苗的机会。假若在出苗把握不大的情况下，冒险下种时，用一半浸过的湿籽和一半干籽，一道播种，如土壤湿度勉强够用，湿籽就可出苗；假若土壤湿度不够则另一半干籽，还可以继续出苗，以减少缺苗的危险。抗旱播种出苗后，如果继续干旱，有些在苗旁用小铁棍斜插数穴，用水壶侧着浇水，水满封口，锄一遍。这样做既省水，而且耐旱时间也长。
    第六、棉花播下种以后，要随时检查田里的出苗情形，并须抽查棉籽在土中的变化。若发现因浸种烫坏或播种技术不佳，出苗无望，或是出苗后冻死、病死、被风砂打死时，应即及早重播。若土内棉籽发芽良好，尚未露出地表，但忽遇大雨，雨后田面往往结成一层干硬泥板，棉芽无力顶破时，可用齿耙在与播种行不同的方向轻轻耙松，助其出土。出苗之后，若遇天雨，雨后要随即锄地除草一次。出苗后间苗的技术，也很重要，间苗最好分二、三次，“早稀苗，密留苗，晚定苗”，“稀留密（少去点的意思），密留稀，不稀不密留大的”，是间苗工作一般的诀窍。碱地定苗，要稍晚些。
    第七、如果棉苗出的不齐，应即速用同一品种的棉籽，及时补播。若播种时间已过，或因病虫灾害，发生了缺苗，则可实行移苗。移苗的方法，是先把所要移出的棉苗，充分浇水（阴湿地或雨后可不浇水），水渗透后，即用铲连苗带土铲出（土块大小，约为三寸见方，深五寸，不要把土块弄散，露出棉根），移入预先挖好的缺苗的坑内，在四周壅土，然后浇水。移苗最好在有真叶时举行。阴天移植，效果更好。移苗的成活率，一般可达百分之九十以上，而且棉苗发育和产量与原播者相差无几。
