The Dujiangyan Irrigation System's Annual Repairs Completed; Water Release Ceremony Held
Water Conservancy Model Representatives Petition Chairman Mao, Reporting on Weir Repair Situation

　　The 1950 annual repair project of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, which irrigates three million mu of fertile land in fifteen counties (cities) of the Western Sichuan region, commenced in early November of last year and was successfully completed by the end of March this year. More than 10,000 farmer representatives from over ten counties near Dujiangyan and representatives from all sectors of Western Sichuan held a water release ceremony in Guanxian on April 1st. The Dujiangyan Water Conservancy Model Representatives Conference also opened simultaneously.

　　The water release ceremony began at 1:00 PM on April 1st. It was drizzling that day, but farmers from various places, carrying red flags, beating gongs and drums, and performing Yangko dances, braved the rain to rush to the venue. As the mighty waters of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System flowed straight down the canals, everyone cheered in celebration. Wang Weizhou, Vice Chairman of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, Chen Li, Deputy Minister of the Southwest Water Conservancy Department, and Li Jingquan, Director of the Western Sichuan Administrative Office, all spoke at the scene. In their speeches, they unanimously pointed out that the success of this annual repair project of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System was due to the fact that the vast number of farmers in Western Sichuan had undergone bandit suppression, anti-local tyrant, and rent reduction movements, and their political awareness had been unprecedentedly enhanced. Therefore, the achievements were significant. They called on farmers in various counties to make early preparations for flood prevention and actively launch a patriotic production campaign in order to produce more grain and enrich the country's economic strength.

　　Dujiangyan is a famous water conservancy project in China with a history of more than 2,000 years and must be repaired annually. In early 1950, Western Sichuan had just been liberated, and the local People's Government allocated 20,000 shi of grain, mobilized a large number of farmers, and the People's Liberation Army assisted in the rush repair of Dujiangyan. This year's annual repair project of Dujiangyan started in early November last year and was completed by the end of March this year. In total, the entire weir involved 440,000 cubic shi chi (市尺) of earthwork, over 121,600 bamboo cages, over 1,000 wooden stakes, over 40,000 stone revetments, and over 7,700 earth revetments. The earthwork alone is equivalent to the total amount of earthwork for annual repairs during the ten years of the Kuomintang reactionary rule.

　　The civilian laborers participating in this annual repair project, recognizing that "repairing the weir is for ourselves" after liberation, were highly enthusiastic about their work, and their work efficiency continuously improved. The average amount of earth dug per person per day increased from the initial 0.4 cubic shi chi to 0.82 cubic shi chi. Many civilian laborers were selected as water conservancy models due to their active work. After the project was completed, these model workers held the Dujiangyan Water Conservancy Model Representatives Conference in Guanxian on April 1st to summarize the experience of this weir repair. At the meeting, all representatives petitioned Chairman Mao, reporting on the situation of this weir repair and thanking Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for their wise leadership. They also pledged that after returning, they would never be arrogant or complacent, but would humbly learn, unite the broad masses, deeply carry out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement among the peasants, actively participate in the land reform movement and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, they will respond to the call of the patriotic production competition with practical actions; bring the spirit of the meeting to every rural area in Western Sichuan, mobilize and organize the masses, do a good job in small-scale water conservancy and flood and drought prevention, and strive to complete this year's agricultural production tasks.

　　都江堰岁修完工举行放水典礼
　　水利模范代表上书毛主席报告修堰情况
    灌溉川西区十五个县（市）三百万亩良田的都江堰一九五○年岁修工程，自去年十一月初动工，到今年三月底止，业已胜利完工。都江堰附近十多县的农民代表一万多人和川西区各界代表，于四月一日在灌县举行放水典礼。都江堰水利模范代表会议也同时开幕。
    放水典礼在四月一日下午一时开始，当日落着小雨，各地农民扛着红旗，敲着锣鼓，扭着秧歌，冒雨赶到会场。当放水时，大家目送着都江堰的滔滔河水，沿渠直下，无不欢呼庆祝。西南军政委员会副主席王维舟、西南水利部副部长陈离，以及川西行署主任李井泉等均当场讲话。他们在讲话中一致指出：这次都江堰的岁修工程，是由于川西广大农民经过剿匪、反恶霸和减租运动，农民的政治觉悟空前提高以后进行的，所以成绩很大。他们号召各县农民及早进行防洪准备工作，积极地展开爱国生产运动，以便增产更多的粮食，充实祖国的经济力量。
    都江堰是我国具有两千多年历史的著名的水利工程，每年都须修整一次。一九五○年初，川西刚解放不久，该区人民政府即拨出两万石粮食，动员了广大农民，并由人民解放军某部协助抢修都江堰。这次都江堰岁修工程是从去年十一月初开始的，到今年三月底完成，总计全堰共作土工四十四万市方（即立方市尺），装竹笼十二万一千六百多条，打木桩一千余根，扎石埂四万余条、土埂七千七百余条。其中仅土工一项，即等于国民党反动统治时期十年的岁修土工数的总和。
    参加这次岁修工程的民工，由于认识到在解放以后“修堰为自己”，大家的工作热情非常高涨，工作效率不断提高，平均每人每日的挖土数量由最初的零点四市方增加到零点八二市方。许多民工由于工作积极，被评选为水利模范。工程结束后，这些模范工作者四月一日在灌县举行了都江堰水利模范代表会议，总结了这次的修堰经验。会议上，全体代表上书毛主席，报告他们这次修堰的情况，感谢毛主席和共产党的英明领导。并保证：回去以后，决不骄傲自满，一定虚心学习，团结广大群众，在农民中深入展开抗美援朝运动，积极参加土地改革运动和镇压反革命分子。同时要以实际行动，响应爱国主义生产竞赛的号召；把会议精神带到川西每一个农村中去，发动和组织群众，搞好小型水利和防洪、防旱等工作，为完成今年的农业生产任务而奋斗。
