　　The Great Flood Storage Project in the Middle Reaches of the Huai River
    Zhu Minxin Li Renyi
    The Huai River flows down from the upstream mountains, passes through Sanhejian at the junction of Henan and Northern Anhui provinces, and reaches Zhengyangguan, west of Shouxian in Northern Anhui, a distance of about 180 li. Along the banks of this winding river section, there are many lakes and depressions. This is the location of the Huai River midstream flood storage project, which is crucial for harnessing the Huai River. The flood storage project has now begun, and the vast land is full of workers, with bright red flags flying everywhere. The songs of the working people resound throughout the fields.
    Going west from Zhengyangguan for more than a hundred li, you will reach Runheji. On the south bank of this market town, a sluice gate to control the floodwaters of the Huai River—a diversion sluice gate—will be built. When reporters arrived there in late March, the area was actively preparing to start construction. Every day, countless cadres, engineers, technicians, and workers flocked to the construction site from various regions. Workers from Liu'an County, who had just undergone land reform, also came from hundreds of miles away. Rails shipped from the Northeast, sleepers cut from the Dabie Mountains, dump trucks loaded with equipment, and grain, coal, yellow stones, cement, and bamboo piled up like mountains at the construction site. Every day, ships emitting black smoke and wooden boats with white sails traveled back and forth along the Huai River from Bengbu or Tianjia'an to Runheji, continuously loading and transporting tons of equipment to the construction site. Near the bank of the Huai River close to the flood storage project, more than a dozen docks resembling city battlements have been built.
    An elderly man with white hair, staring at the rails and dump trucks, exclaimed in surprise: "What kind of contraptions are these? I've never seen them in my life!" An engineering staff member standing next to him smiled and said to him: "Are you surprised to see these things? When full-scale construction starts, there will be even more amazing things!" He pointed around and said: "At that time, in this area of several hundred acres, there will be thirty to forty thousand people working in shifts day and night under the sunlight or electric lights." The old man smiled from ear to ear and said: "Chairman Mao really has a way."

　　伟大的淮河中游蓄洪工程
    朱敏信　李人怡
    淮河从上游山地顺流而下，经过河南、皖北两省区交界处的三河尖，到达皖北区寿县以西的正阳关，约一百八十华里。在这段蜿蜒曲折的河道两岸，密布着许多湖沼与洼地。这就是对根治淮河有决定意义的淮河中游蓄洪工程的所在地。现在，蓄洪工程已经动工，在这一片广阔的土地上，到处簇拥着民工的队伍，飘扬着鲜艳的红旗。劳动人民的歌声响彻四野。
    从正阳关向西走百多里即可到润河集。在这集镇的南岸，将建筑一座控制淮河洪水的水闸——分水闸。在三月下旬记者抵达该地的时候，当地正在积极地准备动工。每天，有无数的干部、工程师、技术工人和民工络绎不绝地从各个地区来到工地上。刚经过土地改革的六安县民工，也从数百里以外赶来。从东北运来的铁轨，从大别山上砍下的枕木，装运器材的斗车，以及粮食、煤炭、黄石、洋灰、毛竹等在工地上堆积如山。每天，从蚌埠或田家庵到润河集段的淮河里，穿梭地来往着冒黑烟的轮船，和挂白帆的木船，源源不断地装载着成吨的器材运抵工地。靠近蓄洪工地的淮河岸边，现已做好了像城垛似的十多个码头。
    一位白发苍苍的老年人，瞅着铁轨、斗车惊叹地问：“这是些什么家伙呢？俺活到今天还没有看到过！”在他旁边站着的工程人员笑着对他说：“你看到这些东西稀奇吗？将来全面动工的时候，更稀奇的东西还多哩！”他向四周指划着说：“那时，这块几百亩见方的地方，要有三、四万人在太阳光或电灯光底下，昼夜轮流地工作。”老年人听得眉开眼笑地说：“毛主席真有办法。”
