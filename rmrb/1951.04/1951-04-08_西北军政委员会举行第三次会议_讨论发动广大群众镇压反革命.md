Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 7th: The Northwest Military and Political Committee held its third meeting from the 24th to the 31st of last month. The meeting focused on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

Gan Siqi, Minister of the Northwest Public Security Department, delivered a report on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the Northwest region. In his report, he pointed out that during the spring and summer of last year, there was a fairly widespread sense of complacency among governments at all levels in the Northwest on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. They failed to earnestly implement the policy of combining suppression with leniency, with the result that American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents engaged in rampant activities. In Gansu Province alone, as many as 2,117 people of various ethnic groups were killed or injured by bandits and special agents, and the amount of property destroyed and looted was incalculable. The people blamed us for "having the heavens but no law." After the State Council and the Supreme People's Court issued instructions on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities last autumn, the mistake of one-sided leniency was initially corrected in various places. In recent months, with the assistance of people of all ethnic groups, the people's governments have cracked hundreds of cases involving American-Chiang Kai-shek special agent organizations and major conspiracies for armed rebellion, captured American imperialist armed spy Osman, vigorously cleared up backlog cases, and successively executed a number of arch-criminals hated by the masses of people of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life. This has struck a blow at the arrogance of counter-revolutionary elements since the American imperialists launched their war of aggression against Korea, and greatly raised the ideological consciousness and vigilance of working cadres and the masses. However, the spirit of resolutely and severely suppressing counter-revolutionaries has not yet been fully implemented in some areas, especially the mobilization of the broad masses to actively participate in the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities, which has not been done enough. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize the existing experience and adopt methods such as accusation meetings, exhibitions, public trials, and forums to mobilize the broad masses to participate in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

After Minister Gan Siqi's report, the members attending the meeting responded with warm applause and unanimously expressed their agreement. Members of various ethnic groups also put forward many supplementary opinions.

Committee Member Tao Zhiyue (Han, currently Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army) said: The broad masses of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army unanimously support the measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries. At present, within our internal ranks and around us, lurking enemies are constantly using every opportunity they can, relying on all old relationships and old friendships, to win over, buy off, and entice a small number of backward elements. We must firmly stand our ground, draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, and resolutely struggle against all open or hidden counter-revolutionary elements. Only in this way can we consolidate the achievements we have already made and enable the people's cause to advance rapidly towards the bright road.

Committee Member Burhan (Uyghur, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government) pointed out: The most brutal enemy of mankind in the world—the imperialists and their running dogs—are using narrow nationalists, reactionaries, pan-Turkists, and pan-Islamists among various ethnic groups in an attempt to incite one ethnic group to oppose another. They spread rumors and sabotage, sow discord, and thereby achieve the goal of splitting ethnic unity. Therefore, we must heighten our political vigilance on this point.

Committee Member Ma Hongbin (Hui, Vice Chairman of the Gansu Provincial People's Government) said: It is necessary to explain clearly to the masses that counter-revolutionary elements are the running dogs of American imperialism and the henchmen of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. They undermine the people's economic construction, sabotage the people's regime, and disrupt social order. If the people want to live in peace, they must report special agents and counter-revolutionary elements, and the government must severely suppress these bad elements. Whether it is your relatives, friends, neighbors, or even family members, as long as they are special agents or counter-revolutionary elements, they must be reported and absolutely cannot be shielded.

Committee Member Ma Fuchen (Hui, Vice Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government) said: In the past, we were too lenient towards counter-revolutionary elements, so the masses did not dare to expose counter-revolutionaries, fearing retaliation. Since the people's government suppressed a number of counter-revolutionary elements, the enthusiasm of the masses to oppose bandits and special agents has rapidly increased. Bandits and special agent elements are the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek Ma Hongkui bandit gang, the running dogs of American imperialism, the scum of ethnic minorities, and the scum of religious circles. They do not sincerely believe in religion, nor do they care about the interests of the ethnic groups in the slightest. Therefore, we believe that suppressing counter-revolutionaries will further strengthen and consolidate ethnic unity and freedom of religious belief. Therefore, the people of all ethnic groups and all religious circles should resolutely support and implement the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

Committee Member Xirao Gyatso (Tibetan, Vice Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government) said: A Buddhist advocates compassion, but the counter-revolutionary activities of counter-revolutionary elements should be severely suppressed. I believe that as long as we adopt a serious, responsible, cautious, and meticulous attitude to deal with it, it is right and beneficial to the people to kill hundreds, thousands, or even millions of counter-revolutionary elements who deserve to be killed. In ethnic minority areas, especially in Tibetan areas, habitual gang robbers, due to the influence of "boundless leniency," have become increasingly rampant; furthermore, some extremely evil bandits and special agents have flocked to ethnic minority areas to lurk and engage in activities. Therefore, the Tibetan people not only urgently demand the early suppression of counter-revolutionary special agent elements, but also demand that professional robbers who repeatedly refuse to repent be severely punished. Only in this way can we stabilize the order in the Tibetan areas and smoothly carry out all work.

Committee Member Dali Zaya (Mongolian, Chairman of the Alxa League Autonomous Committee of Ningxia) firmly stated: In order to consolidate the people's regime and protect the people's lives and property, counter-revolutionary elements, no matter what ethnic group they belong to, should not be tolerated.

Vice Chairman Xi Zhongxun pointed out in summarizing this discussion: The struggle against counter-revolutionary activities will still be a long-term task in the future. As long as there are still reactionary forces at home and abroad, this struggle will exist. Moreover, as the reactionary forces get closer to death, the struggle with counter-revolution will become more acute and cruel. Wherever counter-revolutionary activities have been attacked, they will inevitably become more hidden and make desperate struggles. Wherever the masses are not sufficiently mobilized, it will become their "air-raid shelter." If we are negligent and careless there, we will suffer serious harm. Therefore, in areas where counter-revolutionary activities have been resolutely suppressed, we must never be blindly optimistic and think that the enemy has been completely eliminated. That is wrong. If we become complacent and relaxed because of small victories, we will suffer great losses. As long as we implement the severe suppression of counter-revolutionary activities in our guiding ideology, resolutely implement the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionary Elements," and strictly pay attention to not making mistakes or creating chaos, we can do a good job in suppressing counter-revolutionary activities and will not make mistakes.

The meeting also focused on the issue of land reform. Up to now, 1,095 townships in the Northwest region have completed land reform, and 1,222 townships that are undergoing land reform can be completed before the wheat harvest. The meeting decided that in the agricultural areas of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces where the Han population hasn't undergone land reform and where some ethnic minorities reside will undergo land reform this year on the basis of in-depth rent reduction. Other agricultural areas where ethnic minorities reside mixed with Han or minority agricultural areas (including all of Xinjiang) that cannot yet carry out land reform will universally launch rent reduction movements and strive to universally complete land reform by next winter or the spring of the year after next. The meeting also heard reports from Committee Member Gao Guizi and Sun Weiru, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Consultative Committee, and others who personally participated in the inspection of land reform in Guanzhong. They gave a detailed account of the justice of land reform and the new atmosphere in the countryside after land reform.

Committee members and delegates from various ethnic groups reported on many moving examples of the masses in their respective regions in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Everyone unanimously pointed out that the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea has made great progress, and we should summarize our experience and closely integrate it with various practical tasks so that every region and every person can receive this great patriotic education.

The meeting finally pointed out that all work carried out by various places in the future must be combined with patriotic education. That is, we must launch a large-scale patriotic production competition in the countryside to strive for a bumper harvest; in the cities, we must further improve the work of existing public and private factories and enterprises and launch Ma Hengchang-style small group production movements; at the same time, we should do a good job in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and vigorously transport and sell local products in order to achieve the rapid recovery and revitalization of the national economy. The meeting called on all cadres and people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest region to combine the above three tasks with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, land reform, and the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and to strive to prepare the conditions for large-scale economic construction.

　　西北军政委员会举行第三次会议
　  讨论发动广大群众镇压反革命
    【新华社西安七日电】西北军政委员会第三次会议，于上月二十四日至三十一日举行。会议着重讨论了镇压反革命的问题。
    西北公安部甘泗淇部长在会上作了关于西北地区镇压反革命问题的报告。他在报告中指出：在去年春夏间，西北各级人民政府在镇压反革命的问题上曾相当普遍地存在麻痹思想，未能认真地贯彻镇压与宽大相结合的政策，以致美蒋特务大肆活动，仅甘肃一省各民族人民被土匪、特务杀害死伤的即达二千一百一十七人，被破坏、抢劫的物资更没法计算。人民责备我们“有天无法”。去年秋天，政务院、最高人民法院关于镇压反革命活动的指示颁布之后，各地才初步纠正了片面宽大的错误。数月来，人民政府在各民族人民的协助下，已破获美蒋特务组织及重大阴谋武装叛乱案件数百起，捕获了美帝国主义武装间谍乌斯满等，大力清理了积案，先后处决了一批为各民族各界人民群众所痛恨的反革命首恶分子，打击了美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以来反革命分子的嚣张气焰，大大地提高了工作干部和人民群众的思想觉悟和警惕性。但是，目前在若干地区还未充分贯彻坚决、严厉镇压反革命的精神，尤其是对于发动广大群众积极参加镇压反革命活动，还做得不够。因此，必须总结现有的经验，采取控诉会、展览会、公审会、座谈会等方法，发动广大人民群众参加镇压反革命的工作。
    甘泗淇部长报告后，出席会议的各委员均报以热烈掌声，一致表示同意。各民族委员并提出了许多补充的意见。
    陶峙岳委员（汉族，现任人民解放军新疆军区副司令员）说：新疆各民族广大人民和人民解放军的指战员，一致拥护镇压反革命的措施。目前，在我们的内部和周围，潜伏的敌人还是无时无刻不在利用一切可能利用的机会，凭借一切旧关系、旧交情，对少数落后分子，进行着拉拢、收买和利诱。我们必须坚定立场，划清敌我界限，对一切公开的或潜伏的反革命分子坚决斗争。只有这样，才能巩固我们已经获得的成绩，使人民事业向光明的大道迅速迈进。
    鲍尔汉委员（维吾尔族，新疆省人民政府主席）指出：全世界人类的残暴的仇敌——帝国主义者和他们的走狗们，利用各民族中的狭隘民族主义者、反动派、泛土耳其主义者、泛伊斯兰主义者，企图使一个民族起来反对另一个民族。他们造谣破坏，挑拨离间，借以来达到分裂民族团结的目的。所以我们对这一点，要提高我们的政治警惕性。
    马鸿宾委员（回族，甘肃省人民政府副主席）说：必须向群众说明白：反革命分子是美帝国主义的走狗和蒋介石匪帮的爪牙，他们破坏人民经济建设，破坏人民政权，扰乱社会治安。人民要想过安宁的日子，就必须检举特务反革命分子，政府亦必须严厉镇压这些坏东西。无论是你的亲戚、朋友、乡邻，甚至于亲属，只要是特务反革命分子，一定要检举出来，绝对不可以庇护。
    马辅臣委员（回族、青海省人民政府副主席）说：过去我们对于反革命分子太宽大了，因而人民群众不敢揭发反革命，恐怕遭报复。自从人民政府镇压了一批反革命分子以后，人民群众反对土匪、特务的积极性很快地提高了。土匪特务分子是蒋介石马鸿逵匪帮的残余，是美帝国主义的走狗，是少数民族中的败类，也是教门中的败类。他们并不真心信仰宗教，也丝毫不顾民族的利益。因此，我们认为，镇压反革命会进一步加强与巩固民族团结和信教自由。因此，各民族人民、各个教门，都应该坚决拥护和贯彻镇压反革命工作。
    喜饶嘉措委员（藏族、青海省人民政府副主席）说：一个佛教徒，是主张慈悲的，但对于反革命分子的反革命活动，就应当加以严厉镇压。我认为只要采取严肃、负责、谨慎、细心的态度来处理，对应杀的反革命分子，就是杀百、千、万个也是应该的，是对人民有益的。在少数民族中特别是藏族中，素行不法的结伙抢劫之徒，由于“宽大无边”的影响，益形猖镢；更有一些罪大恶极的土匪特务，纷纷钻到少数民族地区潜伏活动。因此，藏族人民不仅迫切要求早日镇压反革命特务分子，并且要求对于屡不改悔的职业强盗，亦予严办。这样才能安定藏民区的秩序，顺利进行一切工作。
    达理扎雅委员（蒙族，宁夏阿拉善旗自治委员会主席）坚决表示：为了巩固人民政权和保障人民生命财产，对于反革命分子，无论是那一个民族的人，都是不应宽容的。
    习仲勋副主席在总结这一讨论时指出：与反革命活动作斗争，在今后还是长期的任务，只要国内外尚有反动势力存在，这个斗争也就存在，而且当反动势力愈接近死亡，和反革命的斗争也就愈尖锐、愈残酷；凡是反革命活动已遭到打击的地方，他们也势必愈加隐蔽，并作绝望的挣扎。那里群众发动不足，那里就成为他们的“防空洞”。我们在那里疏忽大意了，那里就会遭到严重的危害。所以，凡是坚决地镇压了反革命活动的地区，绝不要盲目乐观起来，以为敌人已经完全消灭了，这是不对的。如因为取得小胜，就麻痹起来，松懈起来，就要吃大亏。只要我们在领导思想上贯彻严厉镇压反革命活动，坚决执行《惩治反革命条例》，严格注意不搞错、搞乱，就可以把镇压反革命工作做好，就不会犯错误。
    会议还着重讨论了土地改革问题。截至目前止，西北区已有一千零九十五个乡完成了土地改革，正在进行土地改革的一千二百二十二个乡，可于麦收前完成。会议决定：陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海四省未经土地改革的汉族地区的部分民族杂居的农业地区，将在今年深入减租的基础上进行土地改革。其他现在还不能进行土地改革的民族杂居或少数民族聚居的农业地区（包括新疆全部），则普遍开展减租运动，争取明冬或后年春季普遍完成土地改革。会议并听取了高桂滋委员和陕西省协商委员会副主席孙蔚如等亲自参加关中土地改革视察工作的报告。他们对于土地改革的正义性和农村在土地改革以后的新气象，作了详尽的叙述。
    来自各民族的委员和列席代表们，曾分别报告了各该地区人民群众在抗美援朝运动中许多动人的事例。大家一致指出：目前，抗美援朝运动已有很大发展，应总结经验，紧密结合各项实际工作，使每一地区、每一个人都受到这种伟大的爱国教育。
    会议最后指出：各地今后进行各项工作，必须与爱国主义教育相结合。这就是要在农村中开展爱国生产大竞赛，争取丰收；在城市中进一步做好现有各公、私工厂、企业的工作，开展马恒昌式的小组生产运动；同时应做好城乡物资交流工作，大力运销土产，以求得国民经济的迅速恢复和振兴。会议号召西北区全体干部和各民族人民，把上述三项工作与镇压反革命、土地改革和抗美援朝运动结合起来，为准备大规模经济建设的条件而斗争。
