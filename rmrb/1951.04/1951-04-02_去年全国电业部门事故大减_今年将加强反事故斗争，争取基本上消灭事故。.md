　　Last year, the national electricity sector greatly reduced accidents.
This year, anti-accident struggle will be strengthened to strive for the basic elimination of accidents.

　　In 1950, the national electricity workers achieved great results in ensuring safe power supply and eliminating accidents. According to statistics from the three regions of Northeast, East China, and North China: the number of accidents decreased by 52% compared with 1949, and the amount of power outage decreased by 92.4%. Among them, some advanced production units have achieved particularly excellent results. For example, the Fengman Hydropower Plant has achieved zero liability accidents throughout the year. The Changchun First Substation has been accident-free for 380 consecutive days. The Tianjin Third Power Plant has also achieved 177 days without accidents. The Jinzhou Electric Power Bureau only had one minor personal injury accident in a year. In addition, power plants in Fushun, Tangshan, and Shijingshan have also basically achieved safe power supply.

　　“Ensuring safe power generation and supply throughout the year” was the policy determined by the First National Electricity Conference in February last year. In the past year, in the process of implementing the above policy, the lack of a sense of responsibility for safe power generation and supply and the erroneous idea that accidents cannot be eliminated among national electricity workers have gradually changed. Electricity units have universally established a responsibility system and formulated some operating procedures related to safe power generation and supply, thus significantly improving the previous chaotic state of unclear responsibilities and lack of rules. Local electricity trade unions have cooperated with the administration to launch mass safety inspection campaigns, organized safe power supply competitions between power plants, and implemented a no-accident bonus system in some power plants, which has further encouraged the enthusiasm of workers for safe power generation and supply. In addition, bureaus and factories have strengthened security work to prevent sabotage by special agents. The Northeast Electric Power Bureau has also mobilized residents along the main lines to protect the safety of the lines.

　　In order to consolidate existing achievements and further achieve safe power generation and supply, the Second National Electricity Conference recently held in Beijing has made "strengthening the anti-accident struggle and basically eliminating accidents" one of the central tasks of the national electricity sector this year. It also specifically stipulates that the national electricity sector should establish mass security organizations and dedicated technical security agencies at all levels, formulate technical management regulations and systems; further promote the dedicated responsibility system, conduct safety inspections, hold safety competitions, and conclude collective contracts to ensure safety, etc.

### 去年全国电业部门事故大减  今年将加强反事故斗争，争取基本上消灭事故。

　　去年全国电业部门事故大减        
    今年将加强反事故斗争，争取基本上消灭事故。
    一九五○年全国电业职工在保证安全供电、消灭事故方面有很大成绩。据东北、华东、华北三个地区统计：事故次数较一九四九年减少了百分之五十二，停供电量减少了百分之九十二点四。其中有些先进的生产单位成绩特别优良。如丰满水电厂已做到全年无责任事故。长春一次变电所已连续三百八十天没有事故。天津第三发电厂也做到一百七十七天没有事故。锦州电业局一年只发生过一次轻伤的人身事故。此外，抚顺、唐山、石景山等电厂也基本上做到了安全供电。
    “保证全年安全发供电”是去年二月第一次全国电业会议的确定的方针。一年来在执行上述方针的过程中，全国电业职工对于安全发供电缺乏责任感和认为事故不可消灭的错误思想，已逐渐转变。各电业单位已普遍建立了责任制度，并订立了一些有关安全发供电的作业规程，因而使以往职责不明、无章可守的紊乱状态有了显著改进。各地电业工会曾配合行政发动了群众性的安全大检查运动，组织各电厂间的安全供电竞赛，加以某些电厂实行了无事故奖励制度，所以更加鼓舞了职工对于安全发供电的积极性。此外，各局、厂还加强了保卫工作，防止了特务分子的破坏。东北电业局更发动了各主要线路沿线居民保护线路的安全。
    为了巩固已有成绩，进一步做到安全发供电，最近在北京召开的第二次全国电业会议已把“加强反事故斗争，基本上消灭事故”作为今年全国电业部门的中心工作之一。并且具体规定全国电业部门应建立群众性的保卫组织和各级技术保安专责机构，订立技术管理规程和制度；进一步推行专责制，举行安全大检查，进行安全竞赛和订立保证安全的集体合同等。
