　　Agricultural Production Movement Enters First Climax
    Spring Planting Unfolds Across the Country
    From the southeast coast to the high and cold northwest regions, the busy season of spring planting has gradually begun. "Around Grain Rain, sow cotton and beans." Now, in all the areas of Hebei, Henan, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Shaanxi provinces where cotton planting is being expanded this year, cotton farmers are even more busy with soaking and sowing seeds.
    This year, most parts of the country started spring plowing preparations earlier and cultivated and planted more appropriately. According to reports from various provinces: early rice has been sown south of the Yangtze River, and the seedlings are emerging with fresh green shoots. Farmers in various provinces are busy plowing fields and irrigating, and transplanting has begun in some areas of Guangdong and Fujian. Jiangxi Province has prepared seedlings for more than 16 million mu of early rice fields. Spring plowing has mostly ended in the mountainous areas of provinces south of the Yangtze River, and crops such as sorghum, corn, soybeans, and sweet potatoes are being sown. In the mountainous areas of southern Sichuan, 7 million mu had been sown by early April, accounting for 60 percent of the area in these mountains. Sugarcane, a specialty of southern Sichuan, has also been planted, covering an area of 250,000 mu, an increase of one-third compared to last year. North of the Yangtze River, in most areas of northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Shandong, Henan, and Hubei provinces, the spring land has been plowed once or twice and spring sowing has generally begun. Most of the sorghum in southern Shandong and Henan has been planted. Currently, cotton is being sown in northern Jiangsu, Henan, and Hubei. Henan Province, famous for its tobacco leaves, plans to sow 830,000 mu of tobacco this year. Most of the tobacco fields have now been sown, and some seedlings have already emerged. According to preliminary statistics, the area sown with tobacco has reached 1.14 million mu. In North China, spring plowing was delayed in some areas due to heavy snow and wet ground, but by the end of February, most of the cotton fields in various places had been harrowed once or twice. In Pingyuan Province, out of 17 million mu of spring land, except for a few alkaline lands, most had been plowed once, and many areas had been plowed twice. Now, millet in the mountainous areas and spring wheat in Suiyuan and Chahar have mostly been sown. The vast plains and the Fen River basin in southern Shanxi have begun to plant cotton. Pingyuan and Hebei are short of rain, and people's governments at all levels are now vigorously leading farmers to fight drought and plant spot crops. In the northwest, the cotton and wheat areas of Guanzhong in Shaanxi Province, the rice area of Hanzhong, and the rice area of Ningxia have also begun to sow cotton and early rice. The 4.1 million mu of cotton fields in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces (an increase of 470,000 mu compared to last year) have generally been plowed once and harrowed three times. The 3.5 million mu of rice fields in southern Shaanxi and Ningxia have also been plowed once. As of early April, the area sown with spring wheat, barley, highland barley, flax, peas, and other crops in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces has reached 31.8 million mu, accounting for about one-third of the spring sowing area in the four provinces. Spring sowing has also begun in Xinjiang Province. The northeastern provinces are now generally sowing spring wheat, and the area sown with wheat will be expanded by one-fourth compared to last year. By early April, farmers in counties south of the Liao River had delivered 80 percent of the manure to the fields and started spring plowing. Spring plowing in various parts of the northeast is generally about ten days earlier than last year.
    With the full-scale development of spring plowing and sowing, a nationwide agricultural production movement on a large scale has entered its first climax under the unprecedentedly high production enthusiasm of farmers across the country. This year's spring plowing has the material foundation of last year's bumper harvest, and the farmers' reproduction conditions are better than last year, with fewer spring famine difficulties. This year's spring plowing is also being carried out on the basis of land reform that is being carried out or has been initially completed in the vast areas of the Yangtze River, both north and south. The people's government's policy of rewarding production has deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, both in the old and new areas. In addition, the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea has been widely launched in rural areas, and patriotic production increase has become the action goal of the majority of farmers. Now, with the development of the spring plowing movement, the patriotic production competition initiated by the agricultural labor model Li Shunda mutual aid group in Shanxi Province has gradually unfolded across the country. Currently, 1,618 labor models and 1,938 mutual aid groups distributed in 29 provinces and regions have made production increase plans, challenged the Li Shunda mutual aid group, and participated in the competition.
    This year's spring plowing preparation, especially organizational preparation, is more thorough than in any previous year. From the central to the local level, people's governments at all levels and party committees at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party have strengthened their leadership and specific organizational work for agricultural production this spring. Most counties in various provinces, prefectures, and new and old districts have formulated practical production plans. Most villages in the old areas, some villages in the new areas, and even many households have formulated production plans. Since the beginning of spring, various provinces, prefectures, and counties have convened enlarged cadre meetings or people's representative meetings and farmer representative meetings centered on discussing this year's spring plowing production. People's governments in North China and many provinces and regions in Northeast, East, and Central South China have organized spring plowing inspection teams to go deep into the countryside to conduct inspections and assist farmers in solving production difficulties. This has played a great role in promoting spring plowing and sowing.    (Xinhua News Agency)

　　农业生产运动进入第一个高潮
   全国春耕播种全面展开
    从东南沿海到西北高寒地区，都已逐渐进入了播种的农忙季节。“谷雨前后，种棉种豆”，现在，所有河北、河南、平原、山西、江苏、湖北和陕西等省今年扩大种棉的地区，棉农浸种播种更加紧张。
    今年全国大部地区的春耕准备工作动手较早，耕种也较适时。据各省报道：现在长江以南早稻都已播种，秧针出土片片新绿。各省农民正忙于翻田灌水，广东和福建部分地区已开始插秧。江西省一千六百多万亩早稻田都已准备好了秧苗。长江以南各省山地，春耕也多已结束，正在播种高粱、玉蜀黍、大豆和甘薯等作物。川南区山地播种在四月初已达七百万亩，占该区山地面积的百分之六十。川南特产甘蔗也已经下种，种植面积为二十五万亩，比去年增加了三分之一。长江以北苏北、皖北、山东、河南、湖北等省区大部地区春地都已耕了一遍到两遍，并已普遍开始春播。鲁南、河南的高粱大部都已种完，现在，苏北、河南和湖北正在播种棉花。以产烟叶著名的河南省今年计划播种烟叶八十三万亩，现在，烟田多已播种，有的已经出土。据初步统计，种烟面积已达一百十四万亩。华北今年部分地区因为雪多地湿推迟了春耕，但到二月底，各地棉田多已耙过一遍到两遍。平原省的一千七百万亩春地，除少数碱地外，已普耕一遍，多数地区耕了两遍。现在，山地的谷子和绥远、察哈尔的春麦多已播种。广大的平原和晋南汾河流域已开始种棉。平原、河北缺雨，各级人民政府现正大力领导农民抗旱点种。西北陕西省关中棉、麦区、汉中水稻区和宁夏水稻区，也已开始播种棉花和早稻。陕西、甘肃两省棉田四百一十万亩（比去年增加四十七万亩）现已普遍耕过一遍，耙了三遍；陕南和宁夏的三百五十万亩稻田也已普耕一遍。截至四月上旬，陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海四省春播小麦、大麦、青稞、胡麻、豌豆等作物已达三千一百八十万亩，约占四省春播面积三分之一。新疆省也已开始春播。东北各省现正普遍播种春麦，小麦播种面积将比去年扩大四分之一。辽河以南各县四月初农民已将百分之八十的粪送到地里，开始插犁春耕。东北各地春耕一般比去年提早了十天左右。
    春耕春播全面展开，一个全国规模的农业大生产运动，已在全国农民生产热情空前高涨下进入第一个高潮。今年春耕有去年丰收的物质基础，农民的再生产条件比去年好，春荒困难不多。今年春耕，又是在长江南北广大地区正进行或已初步完成了土地改革的基础上进行的，人民政府奖励生产的政策，无论老区新区都深入人心。加以抗美援朝运动已在农村中普遍展开，爱国增产已成为广大农民的行动目标。现在，随着春耕运动展开，由山西省农业劳动模范李顺达互助组发起的爱国生产竞赛，已在全国逐渐展开。目前已有分布在二十九个省区的一千六百十八个劳动模范和一千九百三十八个互助组，订了增产的计划，向李顺达互助组应战，参加竞赛。
    今年春耕准备特别是组织准备比以往任何一年充分。从中央到地方，各级人民政府和中国共产党各级党委，今春都加强了对农业生产的领导和具体组织工作。各省、专区以及新老区绝大部分的县都订有切合实际的生产计划。老区的大多数乡村、新区部分乡村，甚至许多农户都订有生产计划。入春以来，各省专区各县都曾先后召开以讨论今年春耕生产为中心的扩大干部会议或各界人民代表会议和农民代表会议。华北各省以及东北、华东、中南许多省区，人民政府均组织了春耕检查团，深入农村进行检查，并协助农民解决生产困难。这对于春耕春播起了极大的推动作用。    （新华社）
