How to Promote Resist America, Aid Korea Among Urban Residents?
    ——Introducing the Experience of the 19th Police Station of Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau
    Zhang Penghui
    Editor's Note: The experience of the 19th Police Station of the Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau in popularizing the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education is summarized from the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in the past stage. This experience is very good, and we hope that police stations in various places will refer to and learn from this experience. We also hope that the 19th Police Station of the Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau will further improve on the basis of its original work, so that all the masses in its jurisdiction, including children, the elderly, the weak, and the disabled, can receive patriotic education on Resist America, Aid Korea.

            Do a Good Job in Ideological and Organizational Preparation
    In the past, the cadres of the 19th Police Station of the Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau did not pay enough attention to current affairs propaganda, and there were wrong ideas and practices such as "the superiors just move their mouths, the subordinates just run errands," "just buzz without listening," and "just to complete the task, regardless of whether the masses can accept it," which caused losses to the work. Especially after American imperialism launched its war of aggression against Korea, because it failed to conduct good propaganda to the masses, there were many confused ideas among the residents. In response to this situation, the leading cadres of the 19th Police Station emphasized the importance of propaganda work, organized cadres to discuss it, and inspected and criticized the past purely task-oriented viewpoint and commandist work style. The cadres began to attach importance to propaganda work. Then, on the basis of the original security committee, a current affairs propaganda committee was established, and a propaganda plan was formulated, requiring that all citizens over the age of eighteen (except for the deaf, dumb, elderly, weak, and disabled) must know "Why does American imperialism want to invade Korea," "What is the relationship between China and Korea," "What should we do," and so on. The police station then used the above conditions to challenge other police stations. After the challenge, all the personnel of the station were extremely enthusiastic and carried out current affairs propaganda to the masses through security sub-committees, residents' groups, joint meetings of residents' group leaders, reading groups, night schools, Spring Festival student propaganda teams, and yangko dance teams. In order to supervise and check the implementation of the propaganda plan and understand the degree of acceptance of the masses after the propaganda, an inspection team was also established, and a review meeting was held.

            Several Effective Propaganda Methods
    The general characteristics of unorganized citizens are: low political awareness, poor organization, wide range of cultural levels, and general working people are struggling for life all day long. According to these characteristics, the police station adopted the following propaganda methods.

    I. Through security sub-committees (i.e., mass security organizations of all strata of citizens, students, small businessmen, and family members of employees within the jurisdiction), discuss and arrange propaganda tasks, and then go deep into the masses to carry out propaganda. In addition to carrying out propaganda among classmates, student representatives also called on students to carry out propaganda to relatives. Each representative reports on the propaganda situation and the ideological situation of the masses at the branch meeting of the security committee every half month, and at the same time formulates the propaganda plan for the next stage. The director of the security sub-committee (the head of the police station) makes a monthly report to the executive committee of the municipal security committee every month; and solicits opinions from the masses to improve the work.

    II. Organize a student Spring Festival propaganda team. During the Spring Festival, a total of twenty-eight students were mobilized to form a propaganda team to rehearse short plays and write blackboard newspapers. Before performing the play, the students first carried out current affairs propaganda; after writing the blackboard newspaper, they organized citizens to discuss it according to the published news. Both of the above methods have achieved great results.

    III. Conduct propaganda through joint meetings of residents' group leaders. There are a total of one hundred and fifteen residents' groups in the entire jurisdiction. At the joint meeting of residents' group leaders during the Spring Festival to support the army and give preferential treatment to family members of revolutionary soldiers, the current situation was explained, and it was explained that doing a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to family members of revolutionary soldiers is also Resist America, Aid Korea. At the meeting, everyone discussed it, and the group leaders expressed their attitudes and launched challenges to each other.

    IV. Hold small-scale mass forums. The method is for the household registration officer to jointly convene residents with the residents' group leader to discuss issues such as "Why is the United States invading," "Is the United States terrible," and "Why is it necessary to suppress counter-revolutionaries." In the discussion, the masses gradually clarified the confused ideas. After the forum, many people persuaded the reactionary elements among their relatives and friends to register with the government.

    V. Through the reading group, discover activists who accuse the atrocities of Japanese and American imperialism as speakers at the accusation meeting. This method of mass self-education has a great effect on improving the political awareness of the masses. When the reading group read the news that the United States was rearming Japan, the audience often spontaneously discussed and accused it. It is relatively easy to discover activists in this situation.

    VI. Conduct propaganda in night schools. Before the night school class, the propagandist explains the current situation in the form of storytelling, or reads touching articles published in the newspaper about donations and condolences, which can greatly encourage the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses.

    VII. Individual conversations. Individual conversations can effectively solve the specific problems of individual masses. For example, if someone is extremely sad and cannot stop crying when accusing the atrocities of the United States and Japan, you can help him transform this hatred into the power of Resist America, Aid Korea.

    VIII. Establish an inspection team to supervise and promote the work. The inspection team is mainly composed of cadres and absorbs patriotic activists from the masses to participate. The inspection content includes the achievements of the propaganda, deviations, and mass reactions. According to the results of the inspection, the masses in the jurisdiction of the police station, except for the elderly, weak, and disabled, although to varying degrees, all know the truth about Resist America, Aid Korea.

            Inspired the Patriotic Enthusiasm of the Masses
    In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the police station discovered a large number of activists through propaganda, donations, and condolences, and trained forty-four propagandists among them. Nineteen reading groups were established, forty reading group members were trained, and 250 people regularly participated in reading. During this period, a total of eight accusation meetings were held, with 1,200 participants; more than 10,000 people listened to current affairs lectures; 2,000 people participated in parades; and 60 to 70 people participated in theatrical performances. Through current affairs education, parades and demonstrations, and accusations of the atrocities of the United States and Japan, the political awareness of the masses has been improved. They have taken practical actions to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. The masses in the jurisdiction of the entire police station donated a total of 1.2 million yuan, wrote more than 40 condolence letters, and donated a large number of condolences.

　　怎样在城市居民中宣传抗美援朝？       
    ——介绍郑州市公安局第十九派出所的经验
    张鹏翬
    编者按：郑州市公安局第十九派出所普及抗美援朝宣传教育的经验，是从过去一个阶段的抗美援朝运动中总结出来的。这个经验很好，我们希望各地派出所参考和学习这个经验。我们并希望郑州公安局第十九派出所在原有的工作基础上，再进一步，务使所辖区内所有群众，包括少年儿童老弱残废在内，都能受到抗美援朝的爱国教育。
            作好思想、组织准备工作
    郑州市公安局第十九派出所的干部，过去对时事宣传工作不够重视，存在着：“上面动动嘴，下面跑跑腿”、“听不听只管嗡”、“为了完成任务，不管群众能否接受”等错误想法和作法，使工作遭受了损失。特别是在美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜的战争之后，因为没能很好地向群众进行宣传，居民中存在着很多混乱思想。第十九派出所领导干部针对这种情况，强调指出了宣传工作的重要性，组织干部进行了讨论，并检查、批判了过去的单纯任务观点和命令主义作风，干部们开始重视了宣传工作。接着以原治安委员会为基础，成立了时事宣传委员会，订出了宣传计划，要求做到必须使十八岁以上的市民（除聋、哑、老弱、残废）都知道“美帝国主义为啥要侵略朝鲜”，“中国与朝鲜是啥关系”，“我们该怎办”，等等。该派出所又以以上条件，向其他派出所提出了挑战。挑战之后，该所全体人员热情极高，通过治安分会、居民小组、居民组长联席会、读报组、夜校、春节学生宣传队、秧歌队等，向群众进行了时事宣传。为了督促与检查宣传计划的执行情况，了解经过宣传后群众的接受程度，又成立了检查组，并举行了检讨会。
            几种有效的宣传方法
    一般无组织市民的特点是：政治觉悟低，组织性差，文化水平悬殊，一般劳动人民又终日为生活而奔波。根据这种特点，该派出所采用了以下几种宣传方法。
    一、通过治安分会（即所辖区内市民、学生、小商人、职员工人家属等各阶层的群众治安组织）讨论、布置宣传任务，然后分头深入群众进行宣传。学生代表除在同学之中进行宣传外，并号召学生向亲属进行宣传。各代表每半月在治安委员会支会上汇报宣传情况与群众思想情况，同时制订下一阶段的宣传计划。治安分会主任（派出所所长）每月向市治安委员会执行委员会作月终报告；并征求群众意见，以改进工作。
    二、组织学生春节宣传队。春节时共动员了二十八个学生，成立了宣传队，排演短剧，写黑板报。演剧之前，学生先作时事宣传；写黑板报之后，根据发表的消息，组织市民进行讨论。以上两种方法，收效均很大。
    三、通过居民组长联席会进行宣传。全所辖区共有一百一十五个居民小组。春节期间召开的拥军优属居民小组长联席会上，讲解了时事，并说明做好拥护军队，优待革命军人家属工作，也就是抗美援朝。会上，大家进行了讨论，组长纷纷表明态度，并相互展开挑战。
    四、召开小型的群众座谈会。方法是由户籍员协同居民小组长共同召集居民，讨论“美国为啥要侵略”，“美国可怕不可怕”，“为啥要镇压反革命”等问题。群众在讨论中，逐步地澄清了混乱思想。座谈会之后，不少人均劝说亲友中的反动分子，到政府登记。
    五、通过读报组发现控诉日、美帝国主义暴行的积极分子，作为控诉会的发言人。这种群众自我教育的方法，对提高群众政治觉悟，收效很大。当读报组读到美国重新武装日本的消息时，听众往往就自发地议论和控诉起来。在这种场合发现积极分子是比较容易的。
    六、在夜校中进行宣传。宣传员在夜校开课之前，用讲故事的方式，讲解时事，或朗读报纸上刊载的捐款、慰问等动人的文章，很能鼓动群众的爱国热情。
    七、个别谈话。个别谈话能有效地解决个别群众的具体问题。如有人在控诉美、日暴行时万分悲愤，泣不成声，就可帮助他把这种仇恨转化为抗美援朝的力量。
    八、成立检查组，督促推动工作。检查组以干部为主，吸收群众中的爱国积极分子参加。检查内容包括宣传的成绩、偏向及群众反应等。根据检查的结果，目前该所辖区内的群众，除老弱残废外，虽在程度上有所不同，但都知道了抗美援朝的道理。
            激发了群众的爱国热情
    在抗美援朝运动中，该派出所通过宣传、捐献、慰问等工作，发现了大批积极分子，并在其中培养了四十四名宣传员。建立了十九个读报小组，培养了四十个读报员，经常参加读报的有二百五十人。这一时期共举行了八次控诉会，参加人数有一千二百人；听过时事讲演的有一万多人；参加游行的有二千人；参加戏剧演出的有六、七十人。通过时事教育，游行示威，控诉美、日暴行，群众的政治觉悟提高了一步，纷纷以实际行动支援中国人民志愿军，全派出所辖区群众共捐款一百二十万元，写慰问信四十余封，和捐献了大批慰问品。
