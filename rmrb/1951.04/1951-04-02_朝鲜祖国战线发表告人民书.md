Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 31st: The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front issued a letter to all democratic political parties, social organizations, and the people of the whole country on March 27th.

The letter to the people first pointed out that during the nine months of the war, the Korean people were not conquered by American imperialism; on the contrary, they caused the American bandits to suffer continuous and shameful defeats. The patriotic and revolutionary heroism of the Korean people in fighting for their country has become an invincible force.

The letter to the people emphatically pointed out that we possess extremely favorable conditions for winning the victory in the Fatherland Liberation War. But there are still many difficulties ahead of us. The road to overcoming all these difficulties is also the road to winning victory.

Our respected leader, General Kim Il-sung, called on us to "Everything for the Front!" "Everything for Victory!", which is the supreme combat task of all patriotic political parties, social organizations, and all Korean people. We must subordinate everything to the victory of the front. We must strengthen the work of supporting the front, continuously restore and repair transportation routes, ensure the timely supply of military materials and food to the front, and not delay for a minute or a second.

Secondly, we must rapidly and completely restore and strengthen local people's power, implement all decisions of the Republic government to stabilize the people's lives, and launch a broad creative movement of the people nationwide based on the spirit of mutual assistance.

"The struggle to increase grain production is the struggle to defend the country and win victory!" "Don't waste a grain of rice, don't let an inch of land become barren!" We must carry out agricultural production in 1951 under extremely difficult conditions, use all possible conditions and local resources, and ensure the victorious completion of spring sowing work.

The letter to the people pointed out that the enemy, facing final destruction, is struggling more frantically. We must be more vigilant than ever before, further consolidate the Fatherland United Front, and not allow a single secret agent, a single spy, or a single saboteur to sneak into our ranks.

The letter to the people concluded: All political parties, social organizations, and patriotic Korean people under the banner of the Fatherland Front will further display patriotic loyalty and heroic dedication, make redoubled efforts to jointly defeat the American aggressors and their running dogs, strive for final victory, and gloriously defend the unification, independence, and honor of the Fatherland.
