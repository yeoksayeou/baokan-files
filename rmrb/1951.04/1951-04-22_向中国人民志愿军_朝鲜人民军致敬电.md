　　Message of Respect to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army

    To the heroic soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army:

    Bearing extraordinary heroic spirit, you are at the forefront of the struggle against American imperialism, fighting to defend world peace, heavily striking and continuing to strike American imperialism and its vassals. Peace-loving people all over the world are cheering for your heroic victories. Today, representatives of all Christian churches and organizations in China are meeting in Beijing, determined to sever all ties between Chinese church organizations and American imperialism, and to eliminate imperialist elements and influences within the church. Your heroic battles and victories have greatly inspired our enthusiasm for resisting America, aiding Korea, loving our country, and we are determined to call on Christians across the country to actively participate in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and thoroughly implement the Three-Self Patriotic Movement within the church. On behalf of all Chinese Christian believers, we extend our warmest thanks and highest respect to you.

        All representatives attending the meeting to handle Christian organizations receiving American subsidies
