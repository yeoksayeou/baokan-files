Decision on Further Consolidating Urban Local Finance
(Approved March 31, 1951)
    I. Certain necessary expenditures of urban local governments should be guaranteed. However, due to the limited financial resources of the state, it is impossible to subsidize local governments, and they must strive for self-sufficiency. The principle of balancing urban local government revenue and expenditure should be based on the necessary undertakings in the locality and the people's ability to bear the burden, striving to organize revenue, ensuring necessary expenditures, and opposing extravagance and waste.
    II. After the national financial administration is divided into levels, the city has become a level of finance. In addition to increasing the city's revenue from consolidating taxes, surcharges, and fees, it is also necessary to gradually develop city-operated enterprises to lay a reliable foundation for the city's financial revenue. The scope of the city's financial revenue is tentatively stipulated as follows:
    1. Various taxes: Real estate tax, deed tax, vehicle and vessel usage license tax, slaughter tax, special consumption behavior tax are generally classified as city financial revenue. When the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government or the People's Government (Military and Political Committee) of the Greater Administrative Area approves its annual budget, any surplus should be turned over to the higher level, and any shortfall should be made up from other taxes in proportion.
    2. Revenue from city-operated enterprises: Various medium-sized or small-scale light industries, construction projects, farms, public utilities such as electricity (excluding those belonging to large power grids), trams, buses, tap water, etc., can be operated by the city. However, at present, except for a few cities in the Northeast that can rely on enterprise revenue to solve part of their financial problems, most cities can only expand production with their own revenue and cultivate the foundation of city-operated enterprises. In order to solve the shortage of funds and manpower, some of these enterprises can adopt methods such as large public-small public cooperation or public-private cooperation. In addition, it is also possible to encourage organ production and organize beggars, vagrants, prisoners, etc. to engage in production. In order to encourage local governments to operate freely, in the future, city-operated enterprises, in addition to complying with the unified principles and plans of national industrial construction, the central government and the greater administrative area should not easily take over.
    3. Various surcharges: The types of surcharges and surcharge rates are stipulated as follows:
    Surcharge on industrial and commercial tax: At present, the most common surcharge on taxes in various cities is the industrial and commercial tax, followed by slaughter tax, transaction tax, entertainment tax, etc.; in addition, provinces and cities directly under the central government also levy political and educational undertakings fees. It is now stipulated that only the industrial and commercial tax surcharge will be retained, and all other surcharges will be abolished. Among the industrial and commercial taxes, surcharges will only be levied on business tax, income tax, and temporary commercial tax, and no surcharges will be levied on peddler business tax. The above surcharges shall be borne by state-owned enterprises and cooperatives alike. The current surcharge rates in various cities range from a minimum of 10% to a maximum of 25%. It is now stipulated that the surcharge rate can only be in the range of 10% to 15%.
    Real estate tax surcharge: After the real estate tax is classified as city revenue, before the regular tax and surcharge are consolidated, it is now stipulated that the maximum shall not exceed 20%.
    Public utility surcharge: Adapt to local conditions and no unified regulations will be made.
    Agricultural tax surcharge: Set at 20%.
    4. Various fee income: Adapt to local conditions and no unified regulations will be made, but cities with more types of fees should be reorganized, and those that can be merged should be merged for collection. Fees with complicated procedures and very small income can also be exempted. On the other hand, cities with very little fee income can also learn from the experience of other cities and appropriately levy some fees.
    5. Cultural, educational, social and health revenue: Such as school tuition revenue, hospital diagnosis and treatment revenue, theater performance revenue, production revenue of relief agencies, etc., should be included in the city budget, so that each business department has the responsibility to organize revenue.
    6. Public property income: In principle, efforts should be made to ensure that all public-owned houses are rented out, so that the rental income can be used to protect existing buildings and develop new buildings, and gradually solve the problem of urban housing shortages. Regarding the rent collection for public houses occupied by organs, this year will be tried out in Beijing, Shanghai, and Qingdao first, and after experience is gained, it will be promoted nationwide next year.
    7. Revenue from judicial and public security fines and confiscations.
    8. Other income: Including the income from the people voluntarily donating funds to assist the government in running certain specific undertakings, this income must be used for specific purposes.
    All the above-mentioned taxes, fees, and judicial and public security fines and confiscations that were originally included in the central budget must be allocated to the city's financial budget along with the various city expenditures originally listed in the central budget. If the city's financial revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, in addition to the municipal construction funds allocated by the central government, which can be appropriately adjusted by the greater administrative area, the rest must be solved by actively organizing local revenue.
    When organizing new revenue, each city must be approved by the city people's representative agency. Those that have a greater impact on the people's burden must also be reported to the people's government (military and political committee) of the greater administrative area for approval before implementation (provinces and cities directly under the central government report to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government).
    The cities referred to in the above decision are limited to municipalities directly under the central government and municipalities directly under the greater administrative area. Whether other provincial-level municipalities implement this decision shall be determined by the provincial people's government.

　　关于进一步整理城市地方财政的决定
　  （一九五一年三月三十一日批准）
    一、城市地方某些必需的开支，应当予以保证，但因国家财力有限，不可能补助地方，必须争取自给。平衡城市地方财政收支的原则，应当是根据当地必须举办的事业与人民负担能力，努力组织收入，保证必要支出，反对铺张浪费。
    二、国家财政分级管理之后，市已成为一级财政。除应从整理税收、附加、规费中增加市的收入外，并须逐步发展市营企业，来奠定市财政收入的可靠基础。关于市财政收入范围，暂行规定如下：
    １、各种税收：房地产税，契税，使用牌照税，屠宰税，特种消费行为税，一般均划为市财政收入。中央人民政府财政部或大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）在核定其全年预算时，收支有余者应上解，不足之数，再从其他税收内按比例留解。
    ２、市营企业收入：各种中型或小型的轻工业，建筑工程，农场，公用事业方面的电气（已属于大电网者在外）、电车、公共汽车、自来水等，均可由市经营。但目前除东北少数城市，已能依靠企业收入解决一部分财政问题外，大多数城市还只能以其本身收入扩大生产，培养市营企业的基础。为解决资金和人力的不足起见，其中一部分企业可采取大公与小公合作或公私合作等办法；此外，还可鼓励机关生产，并组织乞丐、游民、囚犯等从事生产。为奖励地方放手经营起见，今后市营企业，除须服从国家工业建设的统一方针和计划外，中央和大行政区不宜轻易接管。
    ３、各种附加：附加种类及附加比率规定如下：
    工商业税附加：目前各城市在税收上的附加，最普遍的是工商业税，其次尚有屠宰税，交易税，娱乐税等；此外中央直属省市并有开征政教事业费者。兹规定只保留工商业税附加，其他附加，一律停征。在工商业税中，只在营业税、所得税、临时商业税上附加，摊贩业税不附加。以上附加，国营企业与合作社同样负担。各城市现行附加比率，最低为百分之十，最高为百分之二十五，兹规定附加比率只能在百分之十到十五的范围以内。
    房地产税附加：房地产税划为市收入后，在正税与附加尚未整理归并以前，兹规定最高不得超过百分之二十。
    公用事业附加：因地制宜，不作统一规定。
    农业税附加：定为百分之二十。
    ４、各种规费收入：因地制宜，不作统一规定，但某些规费种类较多的城市应加以整理，能合并者合并征收之，其手续较繁、收入很小的规费，亦可不征。另一方面，规费收入很少的城市，亦可吸收其他城市经验，适当开征一些规费。
    ５、文教社会卫生收入：如学校学费收入，医院诊疗收入，剧团演出收入，救济机关生产收入等，均应列入市预算，使各事业部门都有组织收入的责任。
    ６、公产收入：原则上应争取做到公有房屋一律收租，以便用房租收入来保护现有建筑并发展新的建筑，逐步解决城市房荒问题。关于机关占用的公房收租，今年先在北京、上海、青岛三个城市试办，待取得经验后，明年再推行全国。
    ７、司法、公安罚款及没收的收入。
    ８、其他收入：包括人民自愿捐资协助政府兴办某些特定事业的收入，此项收入必须专款专用。
    以上各种税收、规费及司法、公安罚款没收等收入，凡原来已列入中央预算的，须连同中央预算内原列各种市的开支一并划给市财政预算。市财政收支如不能平衡，除了中央拨给的市政建设费可由大行政区作适当调剂外，其余须从积极组织地方性的收入来解决。
    各城市在组织新的收入时，必须经市人民代表机关通过。其对人民负担关系较大的，并须报经大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）批准施行（中央直属省市报中央人民政府财政部）。
    以上决定所指的城市，只限于中央直辖市和大行政区直辖市，其他省辖市是否实行此项决定由省人民政府决定之。
