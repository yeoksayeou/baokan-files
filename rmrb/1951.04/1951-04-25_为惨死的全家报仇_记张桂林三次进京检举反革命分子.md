　　Avenging the Tragic Deaths of His Entire Family
　  ——Zhang Guilin's Three Trips to Beijing to Report Counter-Revolutionaries
    By Our Correspondent　Zhu Bo

    It was a clear day in April, and a train from Dezhou to Beijing was speeding along. In the third-class carriage of this train sat a taciturn young farmer, leaning against the train window, silently observing the vast fields. He was Zhang Guilin from Nansong Village, En County, Hebei Province. This was his third trip to Beijing, seven or eight hundred miles from his home, to report a heinous counter-revolutionary – Man Kairong.
    As the train rushed forward, Zhang Guilin's mood changed rapidly, sometimes excited, sometimes heavy. He longed for the People's Government to stand up for him and avenge his family. He would always clearly remember the tragic scene of his family being ravaged by Man Kairong in the past.
    It was in 1939 when En County was occupied by the Japanese invaders, but the remote countryside was still temporarily clean. The Kuomintang army had long fled. However, the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang who remained relied on the power of the Japanese invaders to carry out a frenzied looting of the vast countryside. Man Kairong was one of them. He transformed from the Chiang bandit gang's village head into the village head of the Japanese puppet regime. His second son, Man Yunsheng, also worked as a traitor in En County; his adopted son, Hu Jinting, was the puppet county magistrate of En County; two of his sworn brothers, one named Hu Jinsheng, was the puppet district chief of this area; and the other, Man Hengbao, was the chief of the puppet police station in this area. Man Kairong relied on the power of these people to act recklessly in the Nansong Village area. As a result, the peasants here suffered unprecedented disasters. At that time, people were hung in the puppet township office by Man Kairong every day; the lightly punished were beaten severely, and the severely punished lost their lives. Zhang Guilin's family was one of these suffering peasant families.
    In June 1939, Zhang Guilin was away learning a trade. His father, the blacksmith Zhang Xihai, made a chaff cutter for the puppet village head Man Kairong, but the Man bandit did not pay for it. Zhang Xihai went to ask for the money, and in doing so offended Man Kairong. The Man bandit sent his guards to arrest Guilin's father and second brother, falsely accusing them of privately manufacturing military supplies and threatening to send them to the puppet county government for punishment. The Zhang family asked many people to intercede and paid a fine of three hundred yuan in puppet currency to escape this disaster.
    In 1941, Man Kairong went to Zhang Guilin's house again, wanting to marry Guilin's sister to the puppet police chief (Man's sworn brother) as a concubine. Guilin's father firmly refused. Guilin's second brother angrily said to the Man bandit: "Although our family is poor, we cannot give our daughter to be a concubine!" Upon hearing this, Man Kairong slammed the table, glared, and cursed: "Born to be dog meat, unable to be served at the table. You don't want to? Hmph! Let's read the script while riding a donkey – we'll see!"
    On May 25th, the Man bandit colluded with a band of scattered soldiers and bandits from the Chiang bandit gang, looting Nansong Village in a chaotic manner. After the bandits left, the Man bandit went to the puppet district office to report that Zhang Guilin's father, uncle, and second brother were all bandits. Then he led puppet troops to surround Nansong Village to arrest people. That day, Zhang Guilin's father and second brother had gone to Sang Village to do blacksmithing and had not returned. The Man bandit then led people to surround Sang Village and arrested them. He shot and killed Guilin's second brother on the spot. Guilin's father was also killed near Nansong Village. The Man bandit was not satisfied and confiscated all of Guilin's family property, driving out Guilin's grandmother and sister.
    Guilin's grandmother fled to Guilin's aunt's house, trembling with fear, unable to eat anything, and constantly calling out the nicknames of Guilin's father and second brother. She died in less than ten days. Guilin's sister hid everywhere because the Man bandit was still sending people to look for her. Soon, she was forced to the point of no return and committed suicide by jumping into a well. Of the entire family, only his uncle (who was going to the market that day when he heard the news and fled) and Guilin, who was apprenticing outside, were left, wandering outside and afraid to go home.
    After En County was liberated, Zhang Guilin returned home in 1948. He knelt at the graves of his father, grandmother, second brother, and sister and cried bitterly. He swore to his deceased relatives: "If I cannot avenge this, I am not your worthy descendant!" From that time on, Guilin inquired everywhere about Man Kairong's whereabouts. Later, he learned that the Man bandit had fled to Beijing (then called Beiping), living in Yangyang Hutong, and had colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. His second son, Man Yunsheng, and adopted son, Hu Jinsheng, had both become agents of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.
    In 1949, Beiping had just been liberated, and Zhang Guilin prepared travel expenses to come to Beiping to find his enemy. In April of the same year, he found Man Kairong in Yangyang Hutong and wanted to go to the Municipal People's Court with him to file a lawsuit. This bandit, who had always been domineering, was frightened when he heard that Guilin was going to sue him. He quickly asked people to intercede, enticing Zhang Guilin with sweet words, saying that he would resolve the matter in any way as long as he did not sue him in the People's Court. Zhang Guilin did not agree and prepared to file a complaint in the People's Court. He first inquired about what crime a criminal like the Man bandit should be sentenced to. A criminal judge said that he would be sentenced to a maximum of six years in prison. After hearing this, Zhang Guilin thought that killing four people and only being sentenced to six years in prison was not enough. He decided to postpone the lawsuit and think of another way later. However, he also thought that the Man bandit already knew the news, and if he did not find a way to stabilize him, he might run away. So Zhang Guilin found Man Kairong again and agreed that they could "resolve the matter peacefully." The Man bandit happily invited more than a dozen people to a restaurant on Qianmen Street to mediate this matter, discussing giving Zhang Guilin two taels of gold as funeral expenses for Guilin's father and others. After that, Zhang Guilin sadly went home. He saved the two taels of gold, planning to return it to Man Kairong when he took his revenge.
    In August 1950, Zhang Guilin heard that the People's Government was going to suppress counter-revolutionaries. He thought it was time, so he took a letter of introduction from the Public Security Bureau of En County People's Government and came to Beijing for the second time to report the counter-revolutionary Man Kairong. This time, he went to the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau. Unexpectedly, a comrade from the Public Security Bureau replied to him: the procedures were not clear. And said: if Man Kairong is to be arrested, it must be approved by the Public Security Department of Hebei Province, and then by the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government. Zhang Guilin's heart sank, and he had no choice but to return to En County.
    This time, it was Zhang Guilin's third trip to Beijing. He saw the "Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries" promulgated by the Central People's Government, and he saw that some heinous guys in his county had been executed by the People's Government. He was very excited, thinking: this time he will definitely be able to avenge his family; if he still can't avenge his family this time, I will sue to Chairman Mao! The masses in his village also encouraged him: "Go, this time it will definitely work, be sure to bring him (the Man bandit) back and let us all relieve our hatred!" Li Enshen, a military dependent from Dashizhuang, also came to Zhang Guilin and said: "We are the same kind of people. You know Man Kairong said I was in contact with the Eighth Route Army, confiscated all my property, and forced my whole family to flee to the Northeast for several years before daring to come back after liberation. This time you go to Beijing, you must catch him back and vent the anger that I have been holding in for these years." This further strengthened Zhang Guilin's determination to come to Beijing. He sold five dou of old corn and borrowed 80,000 yuan for travel expenses.
    Zhang Guilin arrived at the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau. He said to the comrades of the Public Security Bureau: "I am still here to sue the counter-revolutionary Man Kairong. If he is not arrested this time, I will fight him (the Man bandit) myself." The comrades of the Public Security Bureau comforted him and affirmatively replied to his request. The Municipal Public Security Bureau quickly ordered the Fifth Outer Branch to arrest Man Kairong, and sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau of En County People's Government, asking them to send someone to Beijing to escort the Man bandit back to the county for processing.
    When Zhang Guilin saw that his enemy was arrested by the People's Government, he was extremely happy. He said: "These three trips were not in vain, and my family's revenge has been avenged. This time I truly know that the People's Government is standing up for us."

　　为惨死的全家报仇
　  ——记张桂林三次进京检举反革命分子
    本报记者　朱波
    是四月的一个晴朗日子，一列从德州开往北京的火车，迅速地奔驰着。在这列火车的三等车厢里，坐着一位沉默寡言的青年农民，一直伏在火车的窗子上，默默地注意着辽阔的原野。他是河北省恩县南宋庄的人，名叫张桂林。这是他第三次到离家七、八百里的北京，检举一个罪大恶极的反革命分子——满开荣。
    列车急骤地奔驶，张桂林的心情也急骤地在变化，一会兴奋，一会又很沉重。他渴望人民政府给他作主报仇。他永远清楚地记得，过去被满开荣所蹂躏的家庭的悲惨景象。
    是一九三九年的时候，恩县城被日寇占领了，但偏僻的农村暂时还是一片干净土。国民党军队早就跑远了。但是，留下来的蒋匪帮的喽囉们，却依靠着日寇的势力，对广大农村进行疯狂的洗劫。满开荣就是其中的一个。他由蒋匪帮的乡长摇身一变成了日伪的乡长。他的二儿子满运盛也在恩县城内当汉奸；干儿子胡金亭是恩县的伪县长；两个把兄弟，一个叫胡金生，是本区的伪区长；另一个叫满恒保，在本区当伪警察所长。满开荣就仗着这些人的势力，在南宋庄一带胡作非为。于是这里的农民遭受了从来没有过的灾难。那时候每天都有人被满开荣吊在伪乡公所里，轻的挨一顿毒打，重的丢了性命。张桂林家就是这些受难农民中的一个。
    一九三九年的六月，张桂林正在外边学生意。他的父亲——铁匠张希海，给伪乡长满开荣作了一把铡刀，满匪却没有给钱。张希海找去要钱，就这样得罪了满开荣。满匪派他的护兵把桂林父亲和二哥抓走，硬说他俩私造军火，要送他们到伪县政府治罪。张家托了很多人来保，交了三百元伪钞的罚款，才脱过这场灾难。
    一九四一年，满开荣又找到张桂林家去，要把桂林的姐姐嫁给伪警察所长（满的把兄弟）作小老婆。桂林父亲坚决不答应。桂林二哥愤愤地对满匪说：“俺家虽穷，也不能给人作二房呀！”满开荣一听，拍桌子瞪眼大骂：“天生是属狗肉的，上不了桌子，不愿意，哼！咱们骑驴看唱本——走着瞧。”
    五月二十五日，满匪勾结了一股蒋匪帮的散兵土匪，把南宋庄抢了个乱七八糟。土匪走后，满匪就到伪区公所报告去了，说张桂林的父亲、叔叔、二哥都是土匪。接着他就带领伪军包围了南宋庄，要抓人。当天张桂林父亲和二哥到桑庄打铁没有回来。满匪又带着人包围了桑庄把他们抓住，当场就把桂林二哥枪杀了。桂林父亲也在南宋庄村边被杀。满匪并没有满足，又把桂林家全部财产没收，把桂林的祖母和姐姐赶了出去。
    桂林祖母逃到桂林的姑母家，吓得混身发抖，吃不进东西，成天喊桂林父亲及二哥的小名，不到十天死去。桂林的姐姐东躲西藏，因为满匪还派人找她，不久也被逼得无路可走，跳井自杀。一家人只剩下叔父（满匪抓他的当天，他正在赶集，听到风声后逃走了）和在外学徒的桂林，流浪在外边不敢回家。
    恩县解放后，张桂林在一九四八年回到了家里。他跪在父亲、祖母、二哥、姐姐的坟上痛哭了一场。他向已死的亲人发誓：“我要报不了这个仇，我不算你的好子弟！”从那时起，桂林就到处打听满开荣的下落。后来，他知道满匪跑到北京（那时还叫北平），住在养羊胡同，又和蒋介石匪帮勾搭上了，他的二儿子满运盛和干儿子胡金生都当上了蒋介石匪帮的特务。
    一九四九年，北平刚刚解放，张桂林就准备了路费来北平找仇人。同年四月里，他在养羊胡同找到了满开荣，要和他一块到市人民法院打官司。这个一向作威作福的匪徒一听桂林要告他，吓坏了，赶忙托人说情，甜言密语地诱惑张桂林，要怎样解决都行，只要不在人民法院告他。张桂林没有答应，准备去人民法院告状。他首先打听了一下，像满匪这样的罪犯该判个什么罪，一位刑事审判员说，顶多判六年徒刑。张桂林听了之后，他想，杀了四条人命，只判六年徒刑，这官司暂时不打了，以后再想办法。但是又想到满匪已经知道风声，如果不设法稳住他，他可能逃跑。于是张桂林又找到满开荣，答应他可以“和平解决”。满匪很高兴地约请了十几个人在前门大街一家饭馆子里说合这回事，商量着给张桂林二两金子，作为桂林父亲等人的安葬费。此后，张桂林伤心地回家去了，他把二两金子存起来，准备在报仇时还给满开荣。
    一九五○年八月，张桂林听说人民政府要镇压反革命，他认为是时候了，于是拿着恩县人民政府公安局的介绍信，第二次来北京检举反革命分子满开荣。这次他找的是北京市人民政府公安局。不料，公安局的一位同志回答他：手续不清。并且说：如果要逮捕满开荣，须经过河北省公安厅，再经过中央人民政府公安部批准才行。张桂林心里凉了半截，无奈何又回恩县去了。
    这回，是张桂林第三次来北京了。他看到了中央人民政府颁布的“惩治反革命条例”，他看到本县一些罪大恶极的家伙已经被人民政府处决了。他非常兴奋，心想：这次一定能报仇了；如果这次还报不了仇，我就告到毛主席那里去！本村的群众也鼓励他：“去吧，这次准行，千万把他（满匪）押回来，叫咱们都解解恨！”大石庄的军属李恩深也来找张桂林说：“咱们是一样的人，你知道满开荣说我通八路，把我全部财产没收了，逼得我全家逃到东北流浪好几年，解放后才敢回来。你这次到北京去，说什么也要把他逮回来，出一出我这几年来的闷气。”这样更坚定了张桂林来北京的决心。他卖了五斗老玉米，又借了八万元作路费。
    张桂林到了北京市公安局。他对公安局的同志说：“我还是来告反革命满开荣，这次如果不给抓起来，我就亲自和他（满匪）拚了。”公安局的同志安慰了他，并肯定地答复了他的要求。市公安局很快地就命令外五分局，逮捕了满开荣，并且函告恩县人民政府公安局，要他们派人来北京押解满匪回本县处理。
    当张桂林看到他的仇人被人民政府逮捕起来时，他高兴极了。他说：“这三次总算没有白跑，我家的仇报了。这次我算真知道人民政府是为我们作主了。”
