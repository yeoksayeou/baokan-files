Today, as the Chinese people march jubilantly on the bright road of building a new country, they cannot help but harbor immense hatred when they recall the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries for more than twenty years. Our comrades in the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) naturally feel an infinite, hidden pain. Since the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang betrayed the Great Revolution in 1927, plundered the fruits of the revolution, and seized military and political power, they colluded with all imperialists internationally for support; domestically, they used comprador, rogue, warlord, bureaucrat, landlord, and local tyrant reactionary elements as wings and claws; within the Kuomintang, they organized the CC Clique and the Blue Shirts Society and heavily relied on the Kong and Soong financial cliques and other core party hacks as trusted aides. In this way, they formed a dictatorial regime of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital, implemented anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, and anti-people reactionary policies, and thus created years of civil war and induced the Japanese invasion of China. Consequently, bloody acts of killing revolutionary martyrs constantly occurred; I myself was illegally arrested by secret agents on the same day as the Xi'an Incident while on a ship from Hong Kong to Shanghai, narrowly escaping a murderous plot. All this shows that the Kuomintang reactionary government should have been overthrown long before the "July 7th" Incident.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chiang bandit gang not only did not repent but strengthened its fascist rule, creating secret service organizations such as the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (Zhongtong), the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics of the National Military Council (Military Statistics Bureau/Juntong), the Three People's Principles Youth League (Sanqing Tuan), and the Sino-American Cooperative Organization (SACO). Secret agents were spread all over the country, infiltrating various organs, organizations, factories, and schools, carrying out all kinds of counter-revolutionary work, such as bewitching, seducing, framing, arresting, killing, and poisoning minds. As for the crimes of passive resistance against Japan, collusion with Japanese puppets, and corruption and embezzlement, they are well-known facts. The old signboard of the Kuomintang became an object of utter loathing for the people of the whole country, while only a portion of revolutionary patriots within the Kuomintang had room for dispersed organization and covert activities. After the end of the War of Resistance, the Chiang bandit gang plundered the fruits of victory and more frantically colluded with American imperialism to launch a civil war. Fortunately, the people's revolution led by Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party finally crushed this reactionary government, basically liberating all of China, and the Chinese people truly stood up. We, the comrades of the RCCK, should be even more deeply grateful for the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the CCP.

Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, governments at all levels, regarding the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities, have not effectively followed the provisions of Article 7 of the Common Program, and many places have seen excessively lenient deviations, which have aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. Some overt and covert counter-revolutionaries remaining in certain areas of the mainland are still not reconciled to their defeat and are constantly carrying out counter-revolutionary activities in the form of armed riots and clandestine sabotage, in order to disrupt social order and endanger the interests of the people and the country. Therefore, there was the instruction of the Government Administration Council and the Supreme People's Court on the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities last July. Since American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea and forcibly occupied our Taiwan, American-Chiang secret agents and spies, relying on their stubborn organization and treacherous techniques, have become even more unscrupulous in colluding with bandits, despots, and reactionary secret society leaders, attempting to stir up trouble, dreaming of welcoming an American-Chiang counter-offensive landing. They have been constantly stealing our secrets; assassinating our cadres; destroying our railways and bridges; burning our factories and warehouses; and undermining our land reform policy and the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Therefore, there is the solemn measure of the Central People's Government promulgating the Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries this February.

Here, we must be clear on one point: the People's Government is completely different from the bloody rule of the Chiang bandit gang. Whether we look at last year's instructions on the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities or this year's Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, the government still consistently implements a policy combining suppression and leniency. Not long ago, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, under the urgent demands of the broad masses of citizens, executed a batch of leading counter-revolutionaries, each of whom had heavy blood on their hands; and Mayor Peng Zhen's report said that the decision was made after several meetings and discussions; Public Security Bureau Director and concurrently Deputy Director Luo Ruiqing's report also said that more than one hundred people would be released. This is excellent proof of the combination of suppression and leniency. Here, we must also be clear on one point: that leniency must have limits and suppression must be timely, and the latter is actually the most basic requirement of the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Because if counter-revolutionaries can be suppressed during the period of their conspiracy activities, their crimes will not have time to be realized, and the interests of the people will not be harmed. But while this requires the government's efforts, what is even more important is for the masses to rise up and help the government to expose and report all counter-revolutionaries as much as possible.

Now, the people of the whole country have unanimously risen up to support the government's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, studying and discussing the Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, strengthening their vigilance and indignation against counter-revolutionaries. We have historical old hatred for the Chiang bandit gang, and we have an irreconcilable new hatred for the small group of remnants who have fled to Taiwan. Needless to say, we must make special efforts to fight. Recently, RCCK branches in various places expelled a group of undesirable elements, including the serious case of secret agent Yang Shoude, who disguised himself as progressive to infiltrate the RCCK organization and plot activities. This is a major lesson. Now, the RCCK headquarters is conducting an open self-criticism, redoubling its vigilance, and carefully guarding against spies' all-pervasive actions to exploit loopholes, in order to ensure the realization of the organizational policy of "combining consolidation and development." Every one of our comrades must understand the current domestic and international situation, recognize that under the close collusion and full instigation of the US and Chiang, counter-revolutionaries will still make a dying struggle for a relatively long period of time, attempting to retaliate against the people. If we are lenient towards them, we are cruel to the people. We must stand firm on the people's position, recognize the line between the enemy and ourselves, and as long as they are counter-revolutionaries, regardless of whether they are family members, relatives, neighbors, friends, or other relationships, we can only relentlessly expose them and report them, in order to show our serious attitude of serving the people and being responsible to the government. But it is easy to say, but not so easy to do. This requires even more self-examination and self-cleansing in our own minds in order to raise our political awareness and stimulate our courage to struggle, so that we can face living facts to test ourselves, improve ourselves, assist the government, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and achieve the tasks we should have in the united front.

　　我们对于国民党反动派的旧恨新仇
    陈劭先
    中国人民在欢欣鼓舞地走着建设新国家的光明大道的今天，回想到国民党反动派二十多年的黑暗统治，莫不怀抱着万分憎恨的心理。我们民革同志自更有无限的隐痛。自一九二七年蒋介石匪帮背叛了大革命、掠夺了革命果实、窃取了军政大权以后，在国际，勾结一切帝国主义以为支援；在国内，利用买办、流氓、军阀、官僚、土豪、劣绅等反革命分子以为羽翼爪牙；在国民党内，组织ＣＣ、蓝衣社并重用孔宋财阀等嫡系党棍以为股肱心腹。这样，就形成了帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本三位一体的独裁政权，就厉行了反苏、反共、反人民的反动政策，也就制造了连年内战，诱发了日本侵华战争。于是残杀革命志士的血腥事实更不断发生，即我亦曾于西安事变之同日，在由香港开往上海的船中被特务非法逮捕，险遭毒手。这一切，说明了国民党反动政府早在“七七”事变前已是应该推翻的了。
    在抗战时期，蒋匪帮不但不知悔祸，反加强了法西斯统治，创设了中统、军统、三青团以及中美合作所等特务组织。特务分子遍布到全国各地，深入到各机关、团体、工厂和学校中，进行着一切迷惑、引诱、陷害、捕杀以及毒化思想等反革命工作。至于消极抗战、私通日伪和贪污腐化的罪行，更是众所周知的事实。国民党这一块老招牌就更成为全国人民所痛心疾首的对象，而国民党内一部分革命志士则只有分散组织、隐蔽活动的余地。抗战结束，蒋匪帮又掠夺胜利果实，更疯狂地勾结美帝国主义，发动内战。幸而毛主席和中国共产党所领导的人民革命，终于摧毁了这一反动政府，基本上解放了全中国，中国人民才真正站了起来。我们民革同志自更要深深感谢毛主席和中共的英明领导。
    自中央人民政府成立后，各级人民政府关于镇压反革命活动，没有切实依照共同纲领第七条的规定，很多地方发生了过分宽大的偏向，曾经引起人民群众的不满。而残存在大陆上某些地区的一些公开的与暗藏的反革命分子，却还不甘心失败，不断地进行一些武装暴乱和潜伏暗害等方式的反革命活动，以破坏社会治安，危害人民与国家利益。因此才有去年七月政务院与最高人民法院关于镇压反革命活动的指示。自美帝国主义发动侵朝战争、强占我国台湾以后，美蒋特务间谍恃其顽固的组织，奸险的技术，愈加肆无忌惮地勾结土匪、恶霸及反动会道门头子，妄图蠢动，幻想迎接美蒋反攻登陆。他们竟不断窃取我机密；暗杀我干部；毁损我铁路、桥梁；焚烧我工厂、仓库；破坏我土地改革政策和抗美援朝运动。因此又才有今年二月中央人民政府公布惩治反革命条例之严正措施。
    在这里，我们必须明了一点：人民政府与蒋匪帮血腥统治完全两样，无论从去年的镇压反革命活动的指示来看，从今年的惩治反革命条例来看，政府仍然一贯地执行镇压与宽大相结合的政策，不久以前，北京市人民政府在广大市民迫切要求之下，枪决了一批反革命首要分子，这些人每个手上都带有浓重的血腥气味；而彭真市长的报告却说经过数次开会讨论才作决定；公安局罗瑞卿兼局长的报告还说另有一百多人将被释放。这就是镇压与宽大相结合的绝好证明。在这里，我们又必须明了一点：那就是宽大要有边，镇压要及时，而后者实为镇压反革命政策最基本的要求。因为反革命分子如能在阴谋活动时期就受到镇压，则他们的罪行既来不及实现，人民的利益就受不到损害了。但这虽要政府努力，而更重要的是要人民群众起来帮助政府尽量揭发并检举一切反革命分子。
    现在全国人民已经一致起来拥护政府的镇压反革命政策，学习并讨论惩治反革命条例，加强了对于反革命分子的警觉和义愤。我们对于蒋匪帮有了历史上的旧恨，对于逃在台湾的一小撮余孽又有着不共戴天的新仇，不消说是要特别努力奋斗的。最近民革各地分部开除了一批不良分子，其中并有特务杨守德伪装进步混入民革组织阴谋活动的严重案件，这是一个最大的教训。现在民革总部正在公开检讨，加倍警惕，慎防奸细们无孔不入的钻空子行动，以保证“巩固与发展相结合”的组织方针之实现。我们每一个同志都要体察目前国内外形势，认识到反革命分子在美蒋密切勾结、全力策动之下，他们还将在一段比较长远的时期内作垂死的挣扎，以妄图报复人民，我们对他们宽大，就是对人民残忍。我们必须站稳人民立场，认清敌我界线，只要是反革命分子，不论是家属、是亲戚、是乡邻、是朋友、或是其他关系，我们只有无情地予以揭发，予以检举，以表示我们为人民服务、对政府负责的严肃态度。但是说来容易，做来却不是那么容易，这更必须在自己的思想上检讨一番，清洗一番，才能提高政治觉悟，激发斗争勇气，才能面对活生生事实来考验自己，提高自己，协助政府，巩固人民民主专政，达成我们在统一战线中应有的任务。
