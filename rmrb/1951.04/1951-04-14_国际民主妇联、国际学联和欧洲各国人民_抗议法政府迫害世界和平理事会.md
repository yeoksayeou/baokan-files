Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The International Democratic Women's Federation, the International Student Union, and people of various European countries strongly protested against the French government's reactionary measures to prohibit the World Peace Council from operating in France. The International Democratic Women's Federation's protest pointed out that the French government's unreasonable measures were a preparatory step to accelerate the war. The International Student Union condemned the French government's anti-peace action and, on behalf of five million students from seventy-one countries, demanded the revocation of this unreasonable ban.

The Chairperson of the German Democratic Women's Federation, Schmidt, protested on behalf of more than one million members. The Greater Berlin Peace Committee issued a protest statement, pointing out that French President Auriol issued this ban immediately upon returning from the United States, proving that the World Peace Council has struck a blow against the aggressive plans of the North Atlantic Group and the Washington warmongers. The correct response of the citizens of Berlin to this measure is to resolutely demand a popular vote to oppose the militarization of Germany. The protest telegram from the Czechoslovak National Committee for the Defense of Peace pointed out: The French government's violent act is an open attack on peace, indicating its hostility towards the people who are striving for the conclusion of a peace pact and opposing the arming of West Germany. The Bulgarian National Committee for the Defense of Peace also lodged a serious protest.

The protest movement in France is unfolding across the country. According to *Ce Soir*, numerous cities, villages, and enterprises are holding protest demonstrations. Workers in many enterprises went on strike for several hours in protest. The National Committee of the Progressive Christian Alliance and the Paris District Transport Workers' Union have all lodged protests. Local peace committees and people in various residential areas have sent delegations to the Ministry of the Interior to demand the revocation of the ban. Communist Party members of the French National Assembly, Casanova, and Progressive Republican Union member, Vegili, have already raised questions in the parliament. The British National Peace Council has submitted a letter of protest to the French government to French Prime Minister Queuille and the French Embassy in the UK.

    抗议法政府迫害世界和平理事会
    【新华社十三日讯】国际民主妇女联合会、国际学生联合会和欧洲各国人民，强烈抗议法国政府禁止世界和平理事会在法国活动的反动措施。国际民主妇女联合会的抗议指出法国政府的无理措施是加速战争的准备步骤。国际学生联合会斥责法国政府这一反对和平的行为，并代表七十一个国家的五百万学生要求撤消这一无理禁令。
    德国民主妇女联合会主席施密特代表一百多万会员提出抗议。大柏林市和平委员会发表抗议声明，指出法国总统阿里奥尔从美国回来就发布这个禁令，证明世界和平理事会已打击了北大西洋集团与华盛顿战争贩子们的侵略计划。柏林市民对这一措施的正确答复是坚决要求举行人民投票以反对德国军国主义化。捷克斯洛伐克保卫和平委员会的抗议电文指出：法国政府的强暴行为是对和平的公开进攻，表明它对争取缔结和平公约和反对武装西德的人民的敌视。保加利亚保卫和平全国委员会亦提出了严重抗议。
    法国的抗议运动正在全国展开，据《今晚报》报道，众多的城市、乡村与企业中都在举行抗议示威。许多企业的工人曾罢工数小时以示抗议。进步基督教联盟全国委员会和巴黎区运输工人工会，都提出了抗议。各地方和平委员会、各居民区人民纷纷选派代表团往内政部要求撤消禁令。法国国民议会共产党议员卡桑诺伐、进步共和联盟议员魏基利已在议会提出质问。英国全国保卫和平委员会已将致法国政府的抗议书，送交法国总理葛义及法国驻英大使馆。
