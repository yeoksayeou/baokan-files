Beijing Mosque Imams, Village Elders, and Hui Elementary School Principals
Write to Mayor Peng Zhen Endorsing the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries
Many Lamas Express Determination to Assist the Government in Eliminating Spies

[Our Newspaper] The imams and village elders of 34 mosques in Beijing, the principals of 24 Hui elementary schools, and the lamas of 33 lama temples held symposiums on suppressing counter-revolutionary criminals on March 31. Those present expressed their opinions one after another, unanimously supporting the government's measures to suppress counter-revolutionary elements, and expressed their willingness to further assist the government in thoroughly eliminating the remaining counter-revolutionaries. All the imams, village elders, and Hui elementary school principals of the mosques jointly wrote a letter to Mayor Peng Zhen and Deputy Mayors Zhang Youyu and Wu Han, expressing their determination to support the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. The letter stated: "We, the principals of the 24 Hui elementary schools and the imams and village elders of the 34 mosques in Beijing, held a symposium on suppressing counter-revolutionary criminals at the Dongsi Pailou Mosque on the afternoon of March 31. Everyone unanimously and enthusiastically supported the People's Government's 'Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries' and the measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries. In the future, under your wise leadership, in order to consolidate national unity and build the people's capital, in addition to launching in-depth propaganda on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries among the masses, we also guarantee to thoroughly expose counter-revolutionary elements within the Hui community, assist the People's Government in eliminating bandits and spies, and consolidate the revolutionary regime." (Peng Nian, Cheng Run)

[Our Newspaper] The Nationalities Affairs Section of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau held a symposium on March 29 to listen to the opinions of representatives of all sectors of the Hui community on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. More than 60 people attended, including Hui representatives to the Municipal and District People's Representative Conferences, mosque imams, Hui school teachers and students, Hui representatives from various trades, and Hui cadres from government organs. The Hui representatives who participated in the symposium said in unison: "The government is making decisions for the people, eliminating scourges, and everyone is applauding with joy." Imams such as Pang Shiqian cited the doctrines of the Koran in their speeches to explain the reasons for suppressing counter-revolutionaries. More than 20 people, including Ma Yao, a teacher at the Hui People's College, and Yang Yisan, director of the Niujie Hui Cooperative, expressed their opinions, proposing that in order to consolidate the rear area order, everyone must raise their vigilance and expose spies in order to assist the government in thoroughly eliminating the remaining counter-revolutionaries. They suggested that the government should suppress counter-revolutionaries in a timely manner, and that the broadcast recording of the expanded meeting of representatives of all sectors of the people in the Beijing urban area should continue to be broadcasted. Ma Yuhuai, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, said in his final speech that he was willing to convey various suggestions to the government, and also answered the question of whether Hui criminals who were executed would be allowed to be buried according to Hui customs. He said: "Hui prisoners who are executed will still be buried according to Hui customs."
