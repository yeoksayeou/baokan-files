　　The Anti-American Aggression movement in Fujian Province Gradually Moves Towards Balance
　　Xiao Rong
    The Anti-American Aggression movement in Fujian Province has generally proceeded in three stages. The first stage was ideological education on Anti-American Aggression, carried out from within the Party to outside the Party, and from organizations, groups, and schools to organized masses, rapidly setting off a wave of enthusiastic study. The second stage was the large-scale launch of the Anti-American Aggression propaganda movement from organizations, groups, and schools to organized and unorganized masses, and the unfolding of accusations against the crimes of American imperialism's aggression against China. The third stage was, on the basis of the gradual deepening of propaganda and the widespread accusations by the masses against American imperialism, to combine Anti-American Aggression with the current central tasks, making Anti-American Aggression education a driving force for all work.
    The Anti-American Aggression movement throughout the province has gradually spread to the broad masses. The Fujian Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, together with the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, compiled and printed more than 40 types of current affairs propaganda materials, propaganda posters, literary and artistic materials, small leaflets, slogans, and song collections, totaling more than 280,000 copies, and distributed them to various parts of the province. This played a significant role in promoting the widespread development of the Anti-American Aggression movement throughout the province. In the major cities, the methods of Anti-American Aggression propaganda were diverse. Before the end of December last year, Fuzhou had held 21 large lecture meetings and eight Anti-American Aggression literary and art evening parties, each attended by more than a thousand people. The Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on propagandists, mobilized 2,878 students and workers to form 65 propaganda teams, which went to 52 neighborhood committees in the urban area to conduct home visits, give lectures in the alleys, and widely convene accusation meetings. Before December last year, the city held two large rallies and demonstrations. The first was a demonstration march of more than 7,000 people from the industrial and commercial sectors, and the second was a victory celebration and demonstration march of 50,000 people from all walks of life. In Xiamen, when educating cadres and organized masses on Anti-American Aggression, special attention was paid to the study of cadres above the level of street administration team leaders. In Siming District alone, more than 600 street administration cadres participated in the study. Because the education of cadres was relatively thorough, the Anti-American Aggression movement in the city was fully launched by the end of November last year. On November 29, a propaganda team of more than a thousand people was dispatched to the countryside to carry out propaganda despite the rain, and current affairs slides were shown on the streets and in cinemas, with great effect. In early December, people from all walks of life in the city held accusation meetings one after another. After the political awareness of people from all walks of life was raised, they signed patriotic covenants. Department stores in Xiamen generally posted Anti-American Aggression cartoons and slogans on their doors and windows, and the paper wrapping for retail goods was also printed with Anti-American Aggression slogans. During the movement, 99 percent of the students were mobilized to participate in propaganda work, and many students enthusiastically signed up to join military cadre schools, demonstrating a high degree of patriotism. The patriotic movement against American imperialism in church schools also unfolded enthusiastically. Teachers and students from Fuzhou's Union University, Anglo-Chinese College, and other schools denounced the crimes of American imperialism's cultural aggression, issued declarations and letters to church schools, and organized themselves to assist 14 or more secondary and higher-level church schools in carrying out the patriotic movement against American imperialism's cultural aggression.
    The Anti-American Aggression movement is also gradually unfolding in the vast rural areas. Zhangzhou and Minhou have done the best in this regard. Zhangzhou has 276 villages that have set up blackboards for propaganda, 143 villages that have established night schools with over 14,000 peasant students, over 40 rooftop broadcasting stations and 25 reading groups. Minhou, in conjunction with the land reform movement, conducted in-depth current affairs education through the local CPC Delegate Congress, People's Representative Congress and peasant representative meetings at all levels. After returning, the representatives, in conjunction with rural propagandists and land reform work groups, held mass meetings in various villages to deepen the education of Anti-American Aggression among the peasants, raise the peasants' political awareness, and dispel rumors.
    Experience has shown that accusation meetings are the best way to raise the awareness of the masses. For example, in the Wenshan residential area of Nantai District in Fuzhou, after the masses exposed the event of American imperialism seizing public land and forcing people to death in the accusation meeting, it aroused public outrage. Two elderly people in Xiamen used their own personal experiences to accuse American imperialism of its crimes of aggression against China in the newspapers. They started with the Eight-Nation Alliance during the Guangxu period, and went all the way to how the American Consul Bazhen conspired to seize Gulangyu, and how the area became an imperialist "concession," and how the Chinese people suffered all kinds of humiliation, which greatly aroused the people's hatred for American imperialism.
    After extensive Anti-American Aggression education, the general public has now established the idea of ​​hating, despising, and scorning American imperialism. When the Korean War was temporarily in an unfavorable situation, some people thought that "I don't think the United States is a paper tiger," and "The Third World War is about to break out, and Chiang Kai-shek is about to counterattack." After studying current affairs, their ideas have changed. After the Chinese People's Volunteers achieved continuous and major victories, many people who often listened to "Voice of America" ​​also admitted that "The Communist Party really has a way!" The broad masses of people expressed even more admiration for the stable prices. However, the development of the movement is still very uneven. Some people in the industrial and commercial sectors and some upper-level members of the church in the city still lack a correct understanding of Anti-American Aggression, and the current affairs propaganda work in rural areas has not been universally launched. At present, the province is working hard for the balanced development and deepening of the movement. In the city, the main task is to assist church schools in further launching the cultural aggression against American imperialism, and to help church people and upper-level members of the industrial and commercial sectors gradually recognize the reactionary nature of American imperialism; in the countryside, the main task is to combine the suppression of bandits, the opposition to local bullies and land reform to further carry out current affairs education for the peasants.

　　福建省抗美援朝运动逐步走向平衡
　　萧榕
    福建省的抗美援朝运动，大体是分三个阶段进行的。第一个阶段是从党内到党外，从机关、团体、学校到有组织的群众进行了抗美援朝的思想教育，迅速地掀起了学习热潮。第二个阶段是从机关、团体、学校到有组织和无组织的群众，大规模地开始了抗美援朝的宣传运动，并展开了对美帝国主义侵华暴行的控诉。第三个阶段是在宣传逐步深入、群众纷纷控诉美帝国主义的基础上，把抗美援朝和当前中心工作结合起来，使抗美援朝教育成为各项工作的动力。
    全省的抗美援朝运动，已逐步普及到广大群众中去。中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会福建省分会曾与省文学艺术联合会共同编印了时事宣传资料、宣传画、文艺材料、小型传单、标语和歌集等四十多种二十八万多份，分发给全省各地。这对于全省抗美援朝运动的广泛开展起了很大推动作用。在各个主要城市，抗美援朝的宣传方式是多种多样的。去年十二月底以前，福州市曾经举办了二十一次大讲演会和八次抗美援朝文艺晚会，每次与会群众都在千人以上。中共福州市委会曾以宣传员为基础，动员学生和工人二千八百七十八名，组成六十五个宣传队，分头到市区五十二个居民委员会，进行家庭访问，在里弄讲演，并广泛召开控诉会。去年十二月以前，全市举行了两次大的集会与游行示威。第一次是工商界七千余人的示威游行，第二次是各界五万人的祝捷大会和示威游行。厦门市在对干部和有组织的群众进行抗美援朝的教育时，特别注意了街政小组长以上干部的学习。仅思明区就有六百多街政干部参加了学习。因为对干部的教育较深入，全市的抗美援朝运动于去年十一月末就全面展开了。十一月二十九日出动了千余人的宣传队，冒雨下乡宣传，并在街头和影院放映时事幻灯，收效很大。十二月初，全市各界人民纷纷召开控诉大会。各阶层人民的政治觉悟提高后，纷纷订立爱国公约。厦门市的百货商店普遍在自己的门窗上贴了抗美援朝的漫画、标语，零售商品的纸包上也印上了抗美援朝的标语。在运动中，百分之九十九的学生动员起来参加了宣传工作，很多同学踊跃报名参加军事干部学校，表现了高度的爱国主义精神。教会学校反对美帝国主义的爱国运动也热烈地展开了。福州市的协和大学、英华大学等校师生，控诉了美帝国主义的文化侵略罪行，发表了宣言和告教会学校书，并组织起来，协助十四个中等以上的教会学校开展反对美帝国主义文化侵略的爱国运动。
    抗美援朝运动在广大农村中也逐步展开。漳州和闽侯在这方面作得最好。漳州有二百七十六个村举办了黑板报，一百四十三个村开办了夜校，入学农民超过一万四千人，设立了四十几个屋顶广播，组织了二十五个读报小组。闽侯结合土地改革运动，通过该地中共党代表会、人民代表会和各级农民代表会进行深入的时事教育。代表们回去后结合农村宣传员和土地改革工作组，在各村召开群众大会，把抗美援朝的教育深入到农民中去，提高了农民的政治认识，谣言不攻自破。
    经验证明，控诉会是提高群众觉悟最好的方式。如福州南台区文山居民在控诉会中，揭露了美帝国主义霸占公地、逼人致死的事件后，激起了群众的公愤。厦门市有两位老人以自己亲身的遭遇在报上控诉美帝国主义侵华的暴行。他们从光绪年间八国联军说起，一直说到美国领事巴詹怎样阴谋侵占鼓浪屿，以及该地怎样变成了帝国主义的“公地”，中国人怎样受尽了侮辱，大大地激发了人民对于美帝国主义的仇恨。
    经过广泛的抗美援朝教育后，目前一般群众已树立起仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义的思想。当朝鲜战争暂时处于不利情况的时候，部分群众曾认为“我看美国不是纸老虎”，“第三次世界大战马上要爆发，蒋介石要反攻了”，经过时事学习后，他们的思想都转变了。当中国人民志愿军连续取得重大胜利后，许多时常收听“美国之音”的人，也承认“共产党真是有办法！”广大人民对于物价一直稳定，更表示钦佩。不过运动的发展还非常不平衡，城市里若干工商界人士和教会的一些上层分子，对抗美援朝还缺乏正确认识，农村的时事宣传工作更未普遍展开。目前全省正为运动的平衡发展和深入而努力。在城市主要是协助教会学校进一步展开反对美帝国主义的文化侵略，并帮助教会人士和工商界中的上层分子逐步认清美帝国主义的反动本质；在农村则主要是结合清剿土匪、反对恶霸和土地改革，进一步对农民开展时事教育。
