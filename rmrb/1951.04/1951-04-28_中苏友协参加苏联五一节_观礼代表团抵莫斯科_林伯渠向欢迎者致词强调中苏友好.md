　　Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to Participate in Soviet May Day Celebrations
　　Observation Delegation Arrives in Moscow
　　Lin Boqu Addresses Welcomers, Emphasizing Sino-Soviet Friendship
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th] The delegation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, led by Lin Boqu, to attend the Soviet May Day celebrations, arrived in Moscow on the 26th. Welcoming them at the station were Zhang Wentian, the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and embassy staff, as well as Denisov, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and over three hundred representatives from Soviet education, science, and culture.
    Denisov delivered a welcoming speech first.
    Head of Delegation Lin Boqu replied, saying: “Dear Comrades and Friends! The delegation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has come to the capital of the world’s first great socialist country, the Soviet Union, for the first time, just after the publication of the communique on the completion of the Soviet Union’s first post-war Five-Year Plan, and will participate in the 'May Day' International Labor Day celebrations here. We feel boundless excitement and joy. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is a symbol of the friendly unity of the people of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. All members and workers of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association regard it as their supreme honor to be engaged in this sacred work of strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship. The people of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union have a long-lasting and profound friendship. For more than thirty years, the Soviet people and the Soviet government have continuously provided selfless assistance to the Chinese people’s revolutionary cause, which the Chinese people will never forget. We thank the Soviet people for their great righteousness towards the Chinese people, we cherish the deep friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, we will learn from the Soviet people’s spirit of internationalism and patriotism, and we will learn from the Soviet people’s rich experience in struggle and construction. Today, the anti-democratic and aggressive camp headed by US imperialism is trying to create a situation with its aggressive policies that could plunge the world into another abyss of world war at any time. This situation requires us to further strengthen the friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union. The greater friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union is not only for the benefit of the people of the two countries, but also for the benefit of the people of the whole world, and for the happiness, freedom, and peace of all mankind. Let us strengthen the work of Sino-Soviet friendship and unity with a hundredfold and a thousandfold effort! Long live the eternal friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union! Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the wise leader of the Chinese people! Long live Marshal Stalin, the world’s revolutionary teacher and the Chinese people’s dear friend!"

    【新华社莫斯科二十七日电】由林伯渠率领的中苏友好协会参加苏联五一节观礼代表团已于二十六日抵莫斯科。在车站欢迎者有我国驻苏大使张闻天及使馆人员，苏联对外文化协会中央委员会主席捷尼索夫，以及苏联教育、科学和文化界代表三百余人。
    捷尼索夫首先致欢迎词。
    林伯渠团长致答词称：“亲爱的同志们、朋友们！中苏友好协会代表团第一次来到世界上第一个伟大社会主义国家苏联的首都，正逢苏联完成战后第一个五年计划的公报发表之后，并将参加在这里举行的“五一”国际劳动节，感觉无限的兴奋，无限的愉快。中苏友好协会是中苏两大国人民友好团结的象征，所有中苏友好协会会员以及中苏友好协会工作者，都以他们能够从事加强中苏友好的这一神圣工作作为他们无上的光荣。中苏两大国人民有长久而深厚的友谊。三十多年以来，苏联人民和苏联政府不断给予中国人民革命事业以大公无私的援助，中国人民是永远不会忘记的。我们感谢苏联人民对于中国人民的伟大道义，我们珍贵中苏两大民族的深厚友谊，我们要学习苏联人民的国际主义精神和爱国主义精神，我们要学习苏联人民的丰富的斗争经验和建设经验。在今天，以美帝国主义为首的反民主侵略阵营，力图以它们的侵略政策造成一种随时可以把世界卷入另一次世界战争深渊的局面。这种情势就要求我们更加加强中苏两国人民的友好与团结。中苏两国人民的更加友好与团结，不仅只为了两国人民的利益，而且也为了全世界人民的利益，为了全人类的幸福、自由与和平。让我们以百倍千倍的努力来加强中苏友好团结的工作！中苏两国人民永远不朽的友谊与合作万岁！中国人民的英明领袖毛泽东主席万岁！世界革命导师与中国人民的挚友——斯大林大元帅万岁！”
