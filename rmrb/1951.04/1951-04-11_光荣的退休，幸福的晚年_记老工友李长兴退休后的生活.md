　　Glorious Retirement, Happy Old Age
　　——On the Life of Old Worker Li Changxing After Retirement
　　Chen Ge
　　Old man Li Changxing sat on the edge of the kang, holding his dry tobacco pipe, and said to me with a smile: "At the retirement meeting, everyone kept urging me to eat and drink. Biscuits, pastries, melon seeds, and peanuts were spread all over the table. The military representative even told us: 'Take good care of yourself, old man, and live another ten or twenty years...’ Comrade, you tell me, the higher-ups really take care of us, haha!" When talking about retirement, the old man was particularly energetic. He has worked for more than fifty years, and has been a worker at the Tianjin Water Company for thirty-one years. He is seventy-two years old this year. He worked hard all his life, and only last September, after the company implemented the Tianjin Provisional Labor Insurance Regulations, did he gloriously retire and live a happy old age. Now, he can receive 60% of his monthly salary, equivalent to 238 jin of millet. His family is also simple: he has a 64-year-old wife, and his eldest son, Li Wanjun, recently got married and also works at the Tianjin Water Company, earning 450 jin of millet a month. So, the old man is living a very comfortable life now. In his own words: "If I want to eat rice, I eat rice; if I want to eat noodles, I eat noodles. Sometimes I stir-fry a few side dishes and have a drink. When I'm happy, I go to the Workers' Cultural Palace to stroll around; when I'm bored, I go to the company to visit my old buddies." His wife also said: "The old man is very happy! He said to his son: 'I won't burden you, I'll eat my own.' All the neighbors give him a thumbs up and say: The old man has caught up with a good era!"

　　But at first, the old man had many concerns! Last September, after the Tianjin Provisional Labor Insurance Regulations were announced, his eldest son, Li Wanjun, persuaded him, saying: "Dad, you're old enough. You still get paid monthly after you retire. Wouldn't it be nice for you to rest at home?" The old man thought to himself: "I've been working all my life, and I've never heard of getting money for nothing. People always get dismissed when they get old, and they don't give much money. Can it cover food? Can it cover expenses?" He said to his son: "If we're dismissed, we'll only get paid for a month or two, and that's it. Don't let them fool us. It's more reliable to work for money." His son said: "Dad, how can the Communist Party deceive people? Isn't it clearly stated in the newspapers? The trade union and the military representative are also saying the same thing." The old man listened with some skepticism, but finally realized that he was getting old, his spirits were failing, and he also had a cold leg, making it difficult to walk and work. After thinking it over and over, he finally made up his mind and said to his son: "Okay, I'll retire, but it has to be done as they say, otherwise I'll still work."

　　When the company held a meeting to bid farewell to the first group of six or seven retired old workers that day, the old man's worries were dispelled. The company's military representative, manager, and chairman of the trade union all came and gave many instructions, telling everyone to be careful when spending money and not to waste it; each retiree was given a small booklet, and they could take the booklet to the company to collect money every month. Old man Li Changxing received 60% of his original salary, which he would receive until his death. His son said to him: "Dad, are you convinced now?" The old man opened his mouth and just smiled.

　　A few days after retirement, the old man put on the leather jacket he had always been reluctant to wear, put on his new boots, and put his pipe in his mouth, saying to his wife: "I'm bored, I'm going to the company to visit." As soon as he entered the company gate, everyone was shouting: "Here comes Grandpa Li, sit here!" When the old man went to the military representative and the manager, they all offered him a seat, got him tea, and poured water for him, asking him how he was doing. Not to mention the trade union, during the Spring Festival, the chairman of the trade union even personally came to "Grandpa" to pay a New Year's visit.

　　As he spoke, the old man recalled the bitter days before liberation. He pointed to his legs and said: "At that time, I was a worker at the post office, and I couldn't earn enough to eat or drink. In the freezing cold, I covered the mailbags and laid out the mailbags. Those things made of tarpaulin couldn't block the wind, and I got a cold leg; when I got to the water company, I worked hard for decades. I thought that when I got old, I would just be fired. I never expected that I would have today..." His wife chimed in: "This is liberation, things will get better and better in the future, comrade, don't you think so?"

　　光荣的退休，幸福的晚年
　　——记老工友李长兴退休后的生活
　　陈戈
    老头儿李长兴坐在炕沿上，手拿着旱烟袋，笑着对我说：“退休会上，大伙一个劲儿让吃让喝，饼干、点心、瓜子、花生摆了一桌子，军代表还给咱讲：‘老人家好生保养着，再活个十年二十年的。……’同志你说，上边可真照顾咱们啦，哈哈！”谈起退休来，老头儿的劲头特别足。他做了五十多年的工，在天津自来水公司就当了三十一年工役，今年已是七十二岁的人了。他一生辛勤，去年九月公司实行了天津市暂行劳动保险条例后，他才光荣地退休，过着幸福的老年生活。现在，他每月能拿到百分之六十的工资，合二百三十八斤小米，家庭也很简单：有个六十四岁的老伴，大儿子李万钧新近才娶了亲，也在天津自来水公司工作，一个月拿四百五十斤小米。所以，老头儿现在的日子过得挺舒心。用他自己的话说：“想吃米就吃米，想吃面就吃面，有时炒几样小菜喝口酒，高兴了去工人文化宫逛逛，闷了到公司串个门，找老弟兄们去。”他的老伴也说：“老头儿可高兴啦！对儿子说：‘我不连累你们，我自己吃自己。’左邻右舍全翘起大拇指说：老大爷可赶上好时代了！”
    但在最初，老头儿的顾虑可多啦！去年九月，天津市暂行劳动保险条例公布后，大儿子李万钧就动员他说：“爹，你老也够岁数啦，退休后还按月给钱，你老在家歇着不好吗？”老头儿心想：“干了一辈子，没听说过不干活白拿钱的便宜事，自来都是人老了，人家给散了，给不上几个钱，顶的住吃？顶的上花？”他对他儿子说：“散了咱们，给上一两月钱就完了，别叫人家蒙混了去，还是干活拿钱来的牢靠。”儿子说：“爹，共产党多处蒙混过人？报上不是说的清清楚楚？工会、军代表也都是这么说。”老头儿听着半信半疑，终于觉得自己年纪大了，精神不济，又有个寒腿病，走路干活都不利落，左思右想最后才拿定主意对儿子说：“行，我退休，可得照他们说的办，不然我还是干活。”
    到了公司开会欢送头一批退休的六、七个老工人的那天，老头儿的“扣儿”可就解开了。公司的军代表、经理、工会主席都来了，嘱咐了好些话，叫大家花钱时仔细点，不要乱用；每个退休的人都发给一个小本子，拿着本子就能按月到公司领钱，老头儿李长兴是原工资的百分之六十，一直领到身后。他儿子对他说：“爹，可信服了吧？”老头儿张着嘴，只是笑。
    退休后没几天，老头儿就穿上了一向舍不得穿的皮袄，蹬上了新靴子、叼上烟袋，对老伴说：“闷的慌，去公司串个门去。”一进公司的大门，到处都在喊：“李大爷来，这儿坐！”老头儿到了军代表、经理那里，他们都是让坐、拿茶、倒水的，问他身体好不好。工会那里更不用说，过春节时，工会主席还亲自来家给“老大爷”拜年。
    老头儿说着，又回想起解放前的辛酸日子，他指指自己的两腿说：“那时，我在邮局当工役，挣不上吃喝，大冷天里盖信袋，铺信袋，那些蓬布做的东西挡不住风，落了个寒腿病；到了自来水公司，辛辛苦苦干了几十年。心想，到老了还不是开除完事，没指望还有今天……。”他的老伴插上一句：“这是解放啦，往后是越过越好，同志，你说是不是？”
