US-Made French Electoral Law
—Another Treacherous Crime of the French Reactionaries

Disregarding the opposition of the French people, the French reactionaries, with a majority of twelve votes in the National Assembly on the fifth of this month, passed a reactionary bill to amend the electoral system, attempting to change the current system of proportional representation to a majority representation system. This conspiracy of the French reactionaries is an attempt to deprive millions of voters who support the French Communist Party of their representation in the National Assembly, to exclude the Communist Party and progressives from the parliament, and to turn the parliament into a tool that completely obeys American orders.

After World War II, due to the Soviet army's defeat of Hitler's Germany, the democratic and progressive forces throughout Europe greatly increased. Therefore, after liberation, France, based on the will of the majority of the people, implemented a system of proportional representation and universal direct elections in 1946, allowing each party to determine its seats in the parliament according to the proportion of votes it received in the election. For France, which has many political parties, this method is fair and democratic because it guarantees that voters of all political persuasions have their representatives in the parliament.

In the previous (1946) election, nearly six million French voters (one-third of all voters) voted for the Communist Party, making it the largest party in the parliament. For five years, the French Communist Party has waged unremitting struggles inside and outside the parliament to defend the interests of the French people, defend peace and national freedom and independence, and has therefore won greater prestige among the French people, becoming a major obstacle to the French reactionary ruling group's betrayal of France and implementation of the arms expansion and war preparation policy. This October, France will hold its quinquennial parliamentary elections, and the French reactionaries know deeply that if the current system of proportional representation is still used, there is no doubt that more people will vote for the Communist Party, thus enabling the Communist Party to obtain more seats in the parliament. This is precisely what the reactionaries fear and worry about. Therefore, they are deliberately taking this reactionary measure in violation of the constitution—abolishing the current system of proportional representation and replacing it with a majority representation system.

This practice of the French reactionaries is a shameful act of further selling out to the United States.

The French reactionary government shamelessly follows the United States in frantically engaging in arms expansion and war preparations, and under the direction of the United States, issued reactionary orders on January 26 and April 9 of this year, unreasonably prohibiting the three major international democratic organizations—the World Federation of Trade Unions, The Women's International Democratic Federation and the World Federation of Democratic Youth as well as the World Peace Council from operating in France. Now, the French reactionaries have created a so-called majority representation system reactionary election bill to further deprive the French people of their democratic rights. This is clearly a US-made French electoral law. This fully proves that the French reactionaries are determined to sell out the interests of the French people and serve the war policy of the United States.

According to the so-called majority representation electoral law, the various reactionary right-wing parties in France can form groups, manipulate elections in various districts, and divide the seats in the parliament in order to collectively betray the country. Let us take an example to illustrate: For example, in the 1946 election, in the Bouches-du-Rhône department, the Communist Party obtained 113,000 votes, the Popular Republican Movement (Catholic) obtained 53,000 votes, the Gaullist "Rally of the French People" obtained 8,000 votes, the Socialist Party obtained 49,000 votes, and other smaller groups obtained a total of 5,000 votes. The parliamentary seats are allocated according to the proportion of votes obtained by each party. But if based on the new electoral system, the three right-wing parties can jointly nominate a list of candidates to participate in the election. Assuming that each party gets the same number of votes, they would have 160,000 votes, which is considered to have obtained more than 50 percent of the votes in this electoral district, and they can seize all the parliamentary seats allocated to this electoral district. And the Communist Party, which obtained 113,000 votes, cannot get a single seat. Moreover, the reactionary electoral law also abolishes the method of electing different numbers of deputies according to the population ratio of each electoral district, and illegally stipulates that each province should elect the same number of deputies. This is deliberately attacking the working class in the industrial areas of central and northern France where the population is concentrated.

As Paris Soir pointed out: the bill created by the reactionaries is "the most reactionary measure in a hundred years since the struggle for universal suffrage," and it is a step towards fascist rule in France. As the declaration of the French Communist Party pointed out: De Gaulle and other reactionary elements attempted to "prevent the French people from exercising their sovereignty to protest the policies of enslavement and war" and drag France into the US imperialist aggressive war plan. This reactionary treasonous plan of the French reactionaries is absolutely intolerable to the French people. The French people have responded to the call of the French Communist Party and established committees to defend universal suffrage, and are launching a more resolute struggle against this fascist bill, for peace, freedom and democracy.

　　美国制造的法国选举法
    —是法国反动派的又一卖国罪行
    法国反动派不顾法国人民的反对，竟于本月五日在国民议会中，以十二票的多数通过了修改选举制度的反动法案，要把现行的比例代表制的选举法，改变为多数代表制的选举法。法国反动派的这一阴谋，是企图剥夺几百万投票拥护法国共产党的选民们在国民议会中的代表权，把共产党和进步人士从议会中排挤出去，使议会变成彻头彻尾顺从美国命令的工具。
    第二次世界大战以后，由于苏军打败了希特勒德国，使整个欧洲的民主进步势力大大增长。因此，解放后的法国才依据大多数人民的意志，在一九四六年实行了比例代表和普遍直接选举的选举制度，使各政党按在选举中所得到的票数的比例，决定其在议会中的议席。对于存在着许多政党的法国，这个办法是公正而民主的，因为它保证了一切政治倾向的选民在议会中都有他们的代表。
    在前次（一九四六年）的选举中，将近六百万的法国投票人（全部选民三分之一）投票支持共产党，而使共产党成为议会中的第一大党。五年以来，法国共产党为保卫法国人民的利益、保卫和平与国家的自由独立，在议会内外进行了坚持不懈的斗争，因而在法国人民当中赢得了更大的威望，成为法国反动统治集团出卖法国、推行扩军备战政策的重大障碍。今年十月，法国将要举行五年一度的议会选举，法国的反动派深深知道，如果仍旧依照现行的比例代表制选举，没有疑问，将有更多人投票支持共产党，因而使共产党在议会中获得更多的席位。这正是反动派所畏惧与焦虑的。因此，他们处心积虑要采取这种违反宪法的反动措施——废除现行的比例代表选举制，而以多数代表制来代替它。
    法国反动派的这种做法，是进一步向美国卖身投靠的可耻行为。
    法国的反动政府恬不知耻地追随美国疯狂进行扩军备战，并且在美国的指使下，于今年一月二十六日及四月九日先后发布反动命令，无理禁止世界工会联合会、国际民主妇女联合会、世界民主青年联盟等三大国际民主团体及世界和平理事会在法国境内活动。如今，法反动派又制造出所谓多数代表制的反动选举法案，以进一步剥夺法国人民的民主权利。这显然是美国制造的法国选举法。这就充分证明：法国反动派已决心出卖法国人民利益，而为美国的战争政策服务。
    按照所谓多数代表制的选举法，法国反动的右翼各政党可以结成集团，操纵各区的选举，而瓜分议会的席位以便集体卖国。我们举一个例来说明：譬如一九四六年的选举中，在伦河口区，共产党获得十一万三千张选票，天主教人民共和党得到五万三千票，戴高乐派“法兰西人民联盟”得到八千票，社会党得到四万九千票，其他比较小的团体共得五千票，议会席位是按照各党所得票数的比例来分配的。但是如果依据新的选举制，三个右翼政党可以联合提出候选人名单，参加选举。假设他们每个党得到同一的票数，他们便会有十六万票，算是获得这一个选区百分之五十以上的选票，就可以夺取这个选区所分配的全部议席。而获得十一万三千票的共产党，则一个议席也不能得到。而且反动的选举法还废止了按照各选区人口比例选举不同数目的议员的办法，而非法地规定每省选出同等数目的议员。这是有意打击中部和北部人口集中的工业区域的工人阶级。
    正如巴黎今晚报所指出的：反动派们所制造的这一法案，是“自从争取普选的斗争以来一百年中最反动的措施”，它是法国走向法西斯统治的一个步骤。也正如法国共产党的宣言中所指出的：戴高乐及其他反动派分子，企图“阻止法国人民运用他们的主权以抗议奴役及战争的政策”，把法国拖进美帝国主义的侵略战争计划中。法国反动派的这一反动的卖国计划，是法国人民所绝不能容忍的，法国人民已纷纷响应法国共产党的号召，成立了保卫普选委员会，为反对这个法西斯法案，为争取和平、自由和民主而展开更坚决的斗争。
