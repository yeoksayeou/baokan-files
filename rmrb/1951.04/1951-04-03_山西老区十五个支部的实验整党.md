　　The Experiment of Party Consolidation in Fifteen Branches in the Old Revolutionary Base Areas of Shanxi
中共 Shanxi Provincial Party Committee Party Consolidation Office
            I. The Original Situation of the Branches
　　The experiment of consolidating party organizations in the old revolutionary base areas of Shanxi Province was conducted in fifteen branches: Houfata, E'hutang, and Ershilipu in Xing County; Xiaodou Village and Qiyang in Wutai County; Huangtongling, Dahongling, and Dongyu Village in Puding County; Xishan in Yushe County; and Nanhan, Muxue, Beizhuang, Licheng Xiazhai, Jinjiajie, and Beifang in Changzi County. These branches are characterized by their long history. One branch was established in 1946, and the remaining fourteen branches were developed during the War of Resistance Against Japan. The fifteen branches have a total of 458 party members, of whom 242 joined the party from 1938 to 1945, accounting for 52.5 percent of the total number of party members, 173 joined the party from 1946 to 1948, accounting for 38.2 percent of the total number of party members, and only 42 were new party members who joined the party in 1949.
　　After the completion of land reform and the basic victory of the Liberation War, the rural economy gradually recovered and developed, and about 90 percent of party members became middle peasants. In addition, the party organizations in rural areas did not provide enough education for party members, so some party members developed serious political paralysis, ignored the enemy, had slackened fighting spirit, and had other negative and degenerative tendencies. Many branches neglected the leadership of security and militia work, and were "indifferent" to the rumors spread by Yiguandao and the sabotage activities of landlords, and were even apathetic to major events such as Resisting America and Aiding Korea. In production, some party members were willing to work individually rather than help each other; they only cared about their own prosperity, using the excuse of being afraid of delaying work or offending people, and did not lead the masses in production. As Li Erze, the secretary of the Xishan branch, confessed: "When harvesting wheat this year, I was cutting in the field, and my wife drove a donkey back to deliver it. I didn't exchange labor and was casual, and the work in the field was not completed." He Qiao, a party member of Houfata, said: "What I often think about is how to get rid of the position of middle captain, how to expand my flock of sheep, and how to change the cow into a mule, so that I can ride it to various places for a few days." The growth of this kind of thinking has made the party organization lax and scattered, and the number of backward party members has increased. About 30 percent of party members do not work. A small number of branches (four branches in Wutai and Puding) had formalistic tendencies in the past in developing party organizations in pursuit of numbers, forming a huge, bloated, and chaotic phenomenon. Many party members who work actively are also not good at following the mass line.
            II. Gains of Party Consolidation
　　The work of party consolidation began in mid-November 1950 and ended in mid-December. The steps of party consolidation are generally as follows: First, understand the situation of the branch in connection with autumn plowing, and formulate a party consolidation plan through the branch, study documents, and correct the attitude of party members towards party consolidation; second, conduct in-depth inspection of work, conduct specific analysis and criticism, and solve the problems of party members in implementing policies and work style; third, appraise party members, further solve ideological problems of party members, improve the awareness of party members, deal with degenerates and party members who have made mistakes, strengthen organization, and strictly enforce discipline; finally, re-elect branch committees, scientifically divide labor, establish various systems, improve branch leadership, and consolidate the results of party consolidation.
　　The main gains of this party consolidation experiment are: Six branches, through the patriotic education of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, have improved the political awareness of party members, inspired the will to struggle, and overcome the slack, paralysis, and negative retirement thinking. For example, Wang Yingxiang, a party member of Dongyu Village, confessed his wrong idea of lying down and doing nothing, saying: "If all party members were like me, wouldn't Chiang Kai-shek come back again! If American imperialism occupies China, what fruits of liberation, even one's own life cannot be guaranteed." Many party members said: "Not only must we work, but we must do all our work well!" After inspecting and summarizing the work, the party members understood the direction and policies of production, criticized the purely agricultural socialist ideology and the commandist style of work, and initially learned the working methods of the mass line. The policy and ideological level and work enthusiasm of party members have been improved one step further than before. Looking at the results of party consolidation in eleven branches: Before party consolidation, party members who worked actively and had a democratic style accounted for 18.6 percent of the total number of party members, and after party consolidation, this increased to 45 percent; party members who did not work or were pushed to work accounted for 35 percent of the total number of party members before party consolidation, and this decreased to 10.6 percent after party consolidation. The party organizations were purged of lawless and undisciplined elements, opportunists, degenerates, and incorrigible backward elements. The party organization has been initially strengthened and the party's discipline has been strengthened.
            III. Some Experiences and Lessons
　　1. Conducting patriotic education of Resisting America and Aiding Korea in party consolidation is an important key to improving the political awareness of party members, inspiring the will to struggle, and overcoming slack, paralysis, and negative retirement thinking. Only after the political awareness of party members is improved, can problems such as production policy direction and the mass line be easily solved. The branches in Wutai and Puding counties conducted the education of Resisting America and Aiding Korea in connection with the destructive activities of local bandits, special agents, Yiguandao, and landlords. They combined the current aggressive crimes of American imperialism in Korea with the past crimes of Japanese, Chiang, and Yan bandits against the masses to understand the aggressive nature of American imperialism. Everyone understood that American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, landlords and special agents, are constantly sabotaging our construction, and only by continuing to resolutely fight against the enemy can we consolidate our victory and defend our motherland. The Houfata Village branch in Xing County combined the inspection of militia work and security work with the education of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, and on this basis, solved the problems of production policy, production direction, and work style. Some branches neglected this key point and concentrated their efforts on solving problems such as production policy direction at the beginning, but because the negative retirement and paralysis thinking were not well resolved, the enthusiasm of party members was not great.
　　2. Through inspecting and summarizing work, grasping the main problems for analysis and criticism is an effective method to improve the political, ideological, and policy thinking of party members and improve work. In party consolidation, each branch used the comparison between organization and individual work, as well as the combination of organization and improvement of technology and the combination of organization and no improvement of technology, to powerfully illustrate the correctness of the production direction of organizing to improve technology and the superiority of mutual aid production. It also illustrated the consistency between party members leading the masses in production and carrying out their own production, and explained the working methods of the mass line. At the same time, it criticized the backward thinking of some party members who only cared about their own production and were unwilling to lead the masses in production, as well as the simple style of work that only held meetings and shouted slogans without giving specific guidance. Facts have proved that the method of educating party members with their own experiences is easiest for party members to accept.
　　3. The handling of backward party members must first be carried out with party education. Organizational handling must be very serious and cautious. Some backward party members feel that being a party member is good and can get things done, "in the future, if the revolution is successful, they will have a share," so they are unwilling to leave the party, but they are unwilling to fulfill the obligations that party members should fulfill. When appraising party members, these backward elements should first be given education to help them improve their class consciousness so that they have the opportunity to transform themselves. On the basis of the improved awareness of the majority of party members, strictly criticize their mistakes in not working, and take different methods to deal with them according to different situations. Except for the bias of a lack of education and insufficient caution in handling in individual branches, the majority of branches basically implemented the above spirit this time. For example, Li Zhirong, a party member of Xishan Village, accepted everyone's criticism, and he made a guarantee to the party that he would implement the party's resolutions in the future, which was welcomed by everyone. Five party members of the Xiaodou Village branch felt after the party consolidation that they could no longer be party members and asked the party to approve their withdrawal from the party. For those who are unwilling to fulfill the obligations of party members but are unwilling to withdraw from the party, the branch gives them party discipline education. If they still cannot accept it, they are advised to withdraw. Those who have never worked in the past and refuse to participate in party consolidation this time should be considered to have withdrawn from the party on their own. For all those who leave the party above, the branch explained to them that they will still adopt an attitude of enthusiastic education towards them in the future, and hope that they will work hard and be good citizens. After this treatment, party members said that they would be good party members, resolutely work, and obey the party organization; those who left the party generally said that they would work and produce well outside the party. The above-mentioned treatment methods were all passed by the branch general meeting and reported to the county party committee for approval before they took effect.
　　Editor's note: In the experiment of party consolidation in fifteen village branches in the old revolutionary base areas of Shanxi, patriotic education of Resisting America and Aiding Korea was conducted, which improved the political awareness and fighting will of party members. This is correct and necessary. However, in consolidating the party organization and conducting ideological education for party members, it is not enough to only conduct patriotic education. The backward ideas of paralysis, slackness, degeneration, selfishness, and self-interest that exist among rural party members in the fifteen village branches just show that the party lacks systematic communist education for these party members, and party members understand the basic knowledge of the party too poorly or do not understand it at all. Therefore, in party consolidation, if communist education and education on the basic knowledge of the party are not earnestly conducted for party members, then the solution of all ideological and work style problems will not be thorough, and the results of rectification will not be easy to consolidate.

　　山西老区十五个支部的实验整党
    中共山西省委整党办公室
            一、支部的原来情况
    山西省老区整理党组织的实验是在兴县后发塔、恶虎滩、二十里铺，五台县小豆村、?阳，平定县黄统岭、大红岭、东峪村，榆社县西山，长子县南韩、慕学、北庄、黎城下寨、靳家街、北坊等十五个支部进行的。这些支部的特点是历史较长。其中一个支部是一九四六年建立的，其余十四个支部都是抗日战争时期发展起来的。十五个支部共有党员四百五十八人，其中一九三八年至一九四五年入党的二百四十二人，占党员总数的百分之五十二点五，一九四六年至一九四八年入党的一百七十三人，占党员总数的百分之三十八点二，只有四十二人是一九四九年入党的新党员。
    土地改革完成，解放战争基本胜利后，农村经济逐渐恢复与发展，百分之九十左右的党员成为中农。加以农村中党组织对党员的教育不够，因而有一部分党员滋长着严重的政治麻痹，忽视敌人，斗志松懈，消极蜕化等不良倾向。许多支部忽视对治安和民兵工作的领导，对一贯道的造谣活动和地主的破坏行为“满不在乎”，甚至对抗美援朝这样的大事都漠不关心。在生产中，部分党员愿单干不愿互助；只顾自己发家，借口怕误工、怕惹人，而不领导群众生产。正如西山支部书记李二则检讨说：“今年割麦子时我在地里割，老婆赶上毛驴往回送，不变工又随便，地里活也没兑下空。”后发塔党员贺乔说：“我常想的是，如何把中队长推掉，如何扩大自己的羊群，怎样就能把牛换成骡子，好骑上它到各地逛上几天。”这种思想的滋长，使党的组织松懈散漫，落后党员增多，大约有百分之三十的党员不做工作。少数支部（五台、平定的四个支部）过去发展党组织中存在着追求数字的形式主义偏向，形成庞大臃肿与混乱的现象。积极工作的党员，也有许多不善于走群众路线。
            二、整党的收获
    整党工作从一九五○年十一月中旬开始至十二月中旬结束。整党步骤一般是这样的：首先是结合秋耕、了解支部情况，通过支部制定整党计划，学习文件，端正党员整党态度；其次，深入检查工作，具体分析批判，解决党员执行政策和工作作风上的问题；第三，鉴定党员，进一步解决党员思想问题，提高党员觉悟，处理蜕化分子和犯错误的党员，严密组织、严肃纪律；最后，改选支部委员，科学分工，建立各种制度，改进支部领导，巩固整党成果。
    这次整党实验的主要收获是：有六个支部经过了抗美援朝爱国主义的教育，提高了党员的政治觉悟，鼓舞了斗争意志，克服了松懈麻痹消极换班思想。如东峪村党员王迎祥检讨自己躺倒不干的错误思想说：“如果党员都像我这样，蒋介石不是又要回来！美帝国主义侵占了中国，什么翻身果实，连自己性命也保不住。”许多党员都这样表示：“不仅要干，而且一定要把一切工作干好！”经过检查总结工作，党员懂得了生产方向和政策，批判了单纯农业社会主义思想和命令主义作风，初步学会了群众路线的工作方法。党员的政策思想水平和工作积极性，较前提高了一步。从十一个支部的整党结果看：整党前积极工作、作风民主的党员，占党员总数的百分之十八点六，整党后增加到百分之四十五；不做工作或推推动动的党员，整党前占党员总数的百分之三十五，整党后减为百分之十点六。从组织上清洗了违法乱纪分子、投机分子、蜕化分子和屡教不改的落后分子。初步严密了党的组织，加强了党的纪律性。
            三、几点经验教训
    一、整党中进行抗美援朝的爱国主义教育，是提高党员政治觉悟、鼓舞党员斗争意志、克服松懈麻痹、消极退休思想的重要关键。只有党员政治觉悟提高以后，生产政策方向、群众路线等问题也才容易解决。五台、平定两县的支部是联系本地土匪、特务、一贯道和地主的破坏活动来进行抗美援朝教育的。他们把现在美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略罪行和日、蒋、阎匪过去对群众的罪行结合起来，来认识美帝国主义的侵略本质。大家明白了美帝国主义和蒋介石，地主和特务，是时时刻刻在破坏我们的建设的，只有继续和敌人坚决斗争，才能巩固我们的胜利，保卫我们的祖国。兴县后发塔村支部结合了民兵工作和治安工作的检查，联系抗美援朝的教育，在此基础上，解决了生产政策、生产方向和作风问题。有一部分支部，忽视了这一关键，一开始就集中精力解决生产政策方向等问题，但是由于消极退休、麻痹思想没有很好的解决，党员的积极性不大。
    二、通过检查总结工作，抓住主要问题进行分析批判是提高党员政治思想和政策思想、改进工作的有效方法。整党中，各支部用组织起来和单干对比，以及组织起来和提高技术相结合和组织起来不和提高技术相结合的对比，有力地说明了组织起来提高技术生产方向的正确性，与互助生产的优越性，也说明党员带领群众生产与进行自己生产的一致性，并说明了群众路线的工作方法。同时批判了某些党员只顾自己生产不愿领导群众生产的落后思想，以及工作中只开会空喊而不作具体指导的简单作风。事实证明，用党员自己的经验作例子来教育党员的方法，党员最容易接受。
    三、对落后的党员的处理，必须首先进行党的教育。在组织处理上必须十分严肃慎重。部分落后党员觉得当党员好，吃得开，“将来革命成功有自己的一份”，因而不愿离开党，但自己又不愿尽党员应尽的义务。在鉴定党员时，对这些落后分子应首先给以教育，帮助他们提高阶级觉悟，使他们有转变机会。在大多数党员觉悟提高的基础上，严格地批判他们不工作的错误，依据不同情况采取不同方法处理。这次除个别支部有缺乏教育和处理不够慎重的偏向外，大多数支部基本上贯彻了上述精神。如西山村党员李志荣接受了大家的批评，他向党提出保证今后要执行党的决议，得到大家的欢迎。小豆村支部有五个党员在整党后觉得自己不能再作一个党员，向党提出要求批准其退党。对不愿履行党员义务而又不愿退党者，支部给以党纪教育，如仍不能接受，则劝其退出。对过去一贯不做工作，这次又拒绝参加整党者，应认为自行退党。对以上所有出党者，支部都向他们说明今后对他们仍采取热情教育的态度，希望他们好好劳动当个好公民。这样处理后，党员都表示要作一个好党员，坚决的工作，服从党的组织；出党者一般表示，愿在党外好好工作、生产。上述处理办法，都是在支部大会通过，报告县委批准之后生效。
    编者按：山西老区十五个村支部的实验整党中，进行了抗美援朝的爱国主义教育，提高了党员的政治觉悟和斗争意志。这是正确的和必要的。但是，在整顿党的组织进行党员的思想教育中，仅只进行爱国主义教育是不够的。十五个村支部农村党员中存在的麻痹松懈、消极蜕化、自私自利等落后思想，正说明党对这些党员缺乏系统的共产主义教育，党员对党的基本知识了解得太差或者根本不了解。因此，在整党中，假如不认真对党员进行共产主义教育和党的基本知识的教育，那么，一切思想作风问题的解决，就不可能彻底，整风的成果也就不易巩固。
