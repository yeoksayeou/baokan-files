　　The Northwest, Formerly Known for "Barren Land, Impoverished People, Desolation, and Hardship," Is Undergoing Transformation
　  ——A Report on the First Northwest Economic Construction Exhibition
    Zhang Ming

    From mid-February to March 15th, the first Northwest Economic Construction Exhibition was held in Xi'an. Everyone who visited this exhibition began to change their historical view that the Northwest was "barren land, impoverished people, desolate, and hardship."

    The exhibition included seven exhibition halls: agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, industry and mining, transportation, trade, and finance, displaying tens of thousands of charts, pictures, objects, and models. Among them, the most prominent items were: petroleum, fur, and livestock, whose output ranks first in the country; Guanzhong cotton, which is famous throughout the country; and many mountain products and medicinal materials. In the geographical models, there are more than 25 million mu of paddy fields that have been opened since the Qin and Han dynasties, pastures that account for about 50% of the total land area of the region, more than 500 kinds of special products that can be exported, and a large number of heavy industrial raw materials buried in the mountains—coal, iron, gold, copper, tungsten, salt, gypsum, etc.

    However, many charts and paintings show that although the Northwest has abundant resources, under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang before liberation, production was declining and people's lives were becoming increasingly difficult. Qinghai herdsmen were ordered to transport wool to Ma Bufang's unified sales organization (Dexinghai Trading Company), and the remuneration they received was not enough to cover the travel expenses. Therefore, the province's wool production before liberation was reduced by 80% compared with 1933. The area of cotton fields in the Northwest was 4.68 million mu in 1937, but it dropped to 1.33 million mu in 1942.

    What excited the audience the most was the great achievements made in the economic construction of the Northwest in the short year after liberation. The exhibits in each room show that compared with before liberation, in 1950, the area irrigated by new-style canals (excluding general small canals) had increased from 3.8 million mu to 4.55 million mu. The yield of grain per mu increased from 109 jin to 119 jin. The cotton field area increased from more than 3.728 million mu to more than 4.343 million mu. Thanks to the immunization of nearly 2 million livestock last year, the number of diseased animals in pastoral areas has been greatly reduced compared with the past. The output of wool has increased sharply. The transportation industry for exchanging the above-mentioned agricultural and animal husbandry products is recovering and developing. The earthwork and stonework of the Tianlan section of the Longhai Railway have been completed to 7.49 million cubic meters. More than 4,000 kilometers of national highways have been opened to traffic, and 10,000 kilometers of provincial highways have been opened to traffic. Therefore, last year, state-owned trading organizations alone purchased native products, fur, and cotton worth 5 million bolts of cloth. The exhibits also show that although the Northwest industry is still young, it is developing rapidly. Last year, crude oil production increased by 35% compared with the previous year. Power equipment expanded by 26%, and power generation capacity increased by more than 50%. The yarn output of state-owned cotton textile mills also increased by 43% last year compared with the previous year. The financial and market exhibits show that the financial prices in the Northwest have become more stable last year. Last year, the price index of 14 major commodities in six cities, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Xining, Yan'an, and Nanzheng, only increased by 76.6% compared with the previous year, which is an unprecedented phenomenon in more than ten years.

    The reasons for the above-mentioned achievements, in addition to the well-known facts such as the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, many charts focus on the fact that this is also the result of unprecedented national unity. In a set of oil paintings, it is shown that the Ganja and Jiawu tribes in the Tibetan areas of Gansu and Qinghai, who had been feuding for 35 years in the past, have been closely helping each other in production after mediation by the Communist Party and the People's Government.

    This exhibition has given the people a great education. A total of more than 1.18 million workers, farmers, citizens, and ethnic representatives from various provinces visited the exhibition one after another.

### “地瘠民贫，荒凉困苦”的西北正在改观——记西北首次经济建设展览会

　　“地瘠民贫，荒凉困苦”的西北正在改观
　  ——记西北首次经济建设展览会
    张鸣
    二月中旬至三月十五日，西安市举行了西北区首次经济建设展览会。凡是参观过这个展览会的人都开始改变了过去认为西北是“地瘠民贫，荒凉困苦”的历史看法。
    展览会包括农林、水利、畜牧、工矿、交通、贸易、金融七大展览室，分别陈列着各种图表、画片、实物和模型十数万件。其中最突出的实物是：产量占全国第一的石油、皮毛、牲畜，闻名全国的关中棉花和许多山货、药材。在地理模型中，有从秦汉时代开辟至今已达两千五百余万亩的水田，有达全区土地总面积百分之五十左右的牧场，还有五百多种可以输出的特产，以及在崇山峻岭中埋藏着的大量重工业原料——煤、铁、金、铜、钨、盐、石膏等。
    但是，许多图表和绘画都说明，西北虽然有丰富的资源，但是解放前在蒋介石匪帮的统治下，生产却在日益衰落，人民生活也日趋困苦。青海牧民奉命把羊毛驮到马步芳的统销机构（德兴海商号），所得酬偿还不足路费所需。因此该省解放前的羊毛产量较一九三三年减产百分之八十。西北棉田面积在一九三七年为四百六十八万亩，到一九四二年就降到一百三十三万亩。
    使观众最为兴奋的，是在解放后，短短一年中。西北经济建设工作所获得的伟大成就。各室展览品说明：一九五○年和解放以前相较，新式水渠（不包括一般小渠）灌溉的面积已由三百八十万亩上升为四百五十五万亩。原粮每亩产量由一百零九斤上升为一百一十九斤。棉田由三百七十二万八千多亩上升为四百三十四万三千多亩。由于去年为近二百万头牲畜进行了防疫注射，牧区疫畜已较过去大为减少。绒毛产量已较前激增。交流上述农牧产品的交通事业正在恢复发展。陇海路天兰段工程已完成土石方七百四十九万立方米。公路中四千多公里的国道已全部通车，省道通车的已达一万公里。因此，去年仅国营贸易机关所收购的土产、皮毛、棉花就值五百万匹布。展览品又说明虽然还是幼小的西北工业，也在迅速地发展着。去年原油产量比前年增加百分之三十五。电力设备扩充百分之二十六，发电容量增加百分之五十强。国营棉纺织厂的纱产量去年亦比前年增加百分之四十三。金融、市场两类展览品说明了西北去年金融物价已益趋稳定。去年西安、兰州、银川、西宁、延安、南郑六个城市十四种主要商品价格指数，只较前年上升百分之七十六点六，这是十多年来空前未有的现象。
    获得上述成绩的原因，除共产党和人民政府的正确领导等这些人所共知的事实外，许多图表都集中地说明，这也是历史上前所未有的民族团结的结果。在一套油画上表现出，甘肃、青海藏民地区过去互相仇杀了三十五年的甘加、甲吾两部落、在共产党和人民政府调解后已经在生产中亲密互助了。
    这个展览会给了人民群众很大的教育。先后前往参观的工人、农民、市民和各省派来的民族代表共约一百一十八万余人。
