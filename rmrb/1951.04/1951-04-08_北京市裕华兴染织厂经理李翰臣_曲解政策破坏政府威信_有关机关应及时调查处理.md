    Beijing Yuhua Xing Dyeing Factory Manager Li Hanchen
    Distorts Policies, Undermines Government Prestige
    Relevant Authorities Should Investigate and Handle Promptly

    Comrade Editor:
    Li Hanchen, the manager of the private Yuhua Xing Dyeing Factory in Damo Factory, Qianmenwai, Beijing, has always cruelly mistreated workers before liberation, arbitrarily deducting wages, and dismissing workers. During the thirty years he has been a manager, he dismissed no fewer than three thousand workers. After liberation, not only did he not change his past barbaric behavior, but he dared to obstruct workers from participating in political activities and create rumors to undermine government decrees. Li Hanchen is very dissatisfied with workers participating in trade union activities. He said, "You spend all day in meetings, eating Zhang San's food and working for Li Si." The workers love their leaders and often sing and cheer. Li Hanchen said bitterly to worker Shi Youchen, "You shout 'Long live' all day long. Does shouting fill your stomach? When you're hungry, don't you still come here to eat?"
    He has always deliberately misinterpreted the policy of considering both public and private interests and labor-capital benefit. He said to worker Zang Bao'san, "Large factories will undergo joint public-private ownership, and small factories will develop through joint operations. Eventually, they will all be confiscated, and you will suffer. You activists will all have to join the army sooner or later. If the counter is not busy, I think I'll ask you to go home first!"
    Seeing that the workers were becoming more and more united, he felt that it was extremely unfavorable to his illegal oppression of workers. He then bought off the henchman Cheng Jianhua (clerk, landlord background, who has always beaten and scolded workers) to sow discord among the workers. On February 24, Cheng Jianhua, under the instruction of Li Hanchen, forced female worker representative Gao Shumin to put her fingerprint on a confession (the confession stated that worker Gao Furui had raped Gao Shumin) that Cheng had written in advance, attempting to falsely accuse worker Gao Furui, who dared to boldly raise opinions to the capitalists, and use this as an excuse to dismiss Gao Furui. After investigation by the Public Security Bureau and the trade union, Cheng Jianhua has admitted that he was the one who orchestrated it.
    What is especially intolerable is that Li Hanchen often creates rumors to undermine government decrees. During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, he often promoted how terrible America is, how powerful the atomic bomb is, and spread a large amount of fear of America.
    In terms of deducting workers' wages, there has been no improvement after liberation. On one occasion, he even deducted three months' wages from the workers. On the other hand, he secretly transferred property and engaged in tricks such as withdrawing capital. The workers are very angry about this. I suggest that the relevant leading authorities should strengthen education for him and give him the due punishment in a timely manner.

### 北京市裕华兴染织厂经理李翰臣  曲解政策破坏政府威信  有关机关应及时调查处理

    北京市裕华兴染织厂经理李翰臣
    曲解政策破坏政府威信
    有关机关应及时调查处理编辑同志：
    北京市前门外打磨厂私营裕华兴染织工厂经理李翰臣，解放前一贯残酷地虐待工人，随意扣发工资，解雇工人。在他当经理的三十年中，经他解雇的工人不下三千多人。解放后，他不但不改变过去的野蛮行为，竟敢阻碍工人参加政治活动，制造谣言破坏政府法令。李翰臣对工人参加工会活动非常不满，他说：“你们成天开会，吃了张三的饭倒给李四干活。”工人们热爱自己的领袖，常常唱歌和欢呼。李翰臣却恨恨地对工人石有琛说：“你整天喊万岁，喊的饱么？喊饥了还不是到我这里来吃饭。”
    他对公私兼顾劳资两利的政策，一直是故意曲解的。他对工人臧宝三说：“大厂子公私合营，小厂子联营发展，将来一下子没收了，你们就要受罪。你们这些积极分子早晚都得去当兵。柜上不忙，我看就请你先回家！”
    他看见工人们越来越团结，感到对自己非法压迫工人极端不利。便收买狗腿子程建华（职员、地主成份，一向打骂工人）在工人中进行挑拨离间。二月二十四日，程建华接受李翰臣的指使，强迫女工代表高淑敏在程预先写就的口供（口供内说工人高福瑞强奸了高淑敏）上画押，企图借此诬告敢于大胆向资方提意见的工人高福瑞，并借此解雇高福瑞。经过公安局与工会调查，程建华已承认是他搞的鬼。
    尤其不可容忍的，是李翰臣经常制造谣言，破坏政府法令。在抗美援朝运动中，他经常宣传美国如何可怕，原子弹如何厉害，大量散布恐美思想。
    在扣发工人工资方面，解放后也没有改进，有一次，竟然扣了工人三个月的工资。另一方面，他又偷偷地转移财产，玩弄抽调资本等诡计，工人对此都非常愤怒。我建议有关领导机关应对其加强教育并及时给以应得处分。
