This newspaper's special reporter Fu Zhensheng reports: Since the beginning of April, major cities in Northeast China have gradually launched a large-scale propaganda movement to respond to the resolutions of the World Peace Council and to popularize and deepen the campaign to Resist America, Aid Korea. In this movement, factories in various regions have also combined it with patriotic emulation campaigns and major security inspections. According to statistics from fourteen cities including Jinzhou, Harbin, Dalian, Qiqihar, Dandong, Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, Yingkou, Xi'an, Fuxin, Siping, and Mudanjiang, more than 1,600 speakers were organized (excluding speakers from factories and mines in some areas), who gave more than 2,800 reports to an audience of approximately 1.2 million people. More than 25,600 propagandists (excluding factory and mine propagandists and street propagandists in some areas) all participated in the activities. Propagandists from Party branches in government agencies universally carried out propaganda activities among street residents. For example, in Qiqihar, 667 propagandists from provincial and municipal agency branches conducted propaganda; in Heping District of Shenyang, more than 600 propagandists from agency branches participated in propaganda activities, with the most giving more than ten presentations and the least giving one. In addition, the city organized more than 20,000 temporary propaganda teams to conduct propaganda in the streets and rural areas on the outskirts of the city. In Harbin, there were a total of more than 10,200 temporary propaganda team members (including government cadres, students, etc.); in Jinzhou, more than 2,000 people participated. Thanks to the role played by propagandists and speakers, and the organization of a large number of temporary propaganda teams, the work of propaganda and education to Resist America, Aid Korea in major cities in Northeast China is now flourishing. Most areas are mobilizing the masses to denounce the crimes and atrocities of Japanese and American bandits and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Through denunciation, the masses' old and new hatred is naturally concentrated on American imperialism. Publicly-owned factories in Dalian universally organized denunciation movements. Fushun has organized 110 denunciation meetings with 22,000 participants. Fuxin also had 27,000 participants in denunciations. Jinzhou has held 746 denunciation meetings with 3,758 people speaking and more than 115,000 people attending the meetings. In addition, the city organized a radio denunciation conference with more than 2,000 participants and more than 40 people requesting to speak. Simultaneously with the conference, 350 listening groups organized 100,000 people to listen, and the masses participating in the meeting and listening to the broadcast were extremely indignant. The listening groups spontaneously donated 5.94 million yuan in Renminbi and 7.87 million yuan in Northeast currency on the spot. Teacher Ke Zhiyu donated her gold ring on the spot to express sympathy to the Chinese People's Volunteers. Qiqihar also held a radio denunciation conference on April 20 with nearly 20,000 participants. Some areas simultaneously held signatures endorsing the conclusion of a peace pact and voting against the American arming of Japan. Most areas signed patriotic pacts according to different units, different industries, and different strata. This propaganda to Resist America, Aid Korea has obviously greatly promoted various tasks. Since the launch of the propaganda to Resist America, Aid Korea in Dalian, 390 advanced production teams have emerged. According to statistics from eight factories in the city, more than 95 percent of the employees participated in the production competition. The propaganda and education campaign in Fushun Open-pit Mine was carried out well, which made the major security inspection successful. Through this propaganda movement, many blank spots in propaganda work have been eliminated in large and medium-sized cities. For example, in Jinzhou, the blank spots in the entire city were 20 percent at the beginning of April, but decreased to 10 percent in mid-April. After the radio denunciation conference and small-scale denunciation meetings after April 18, the maximum number of blank spots in the city was no more than 5 percent. Among the 200,000 people in Qiqihar, 7,300 had not received patriotic education to Resist America, Aid Korea, which has now been reduced to 2,100, accounting for about 1 percent of the city's population. However, in small cities and rural areas, serious efforts are still needed to truly popularize the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea.

　　东北大中城市普及抗美援朝宣传
　  部分地区同时签名拥护缔结和平公约投票反对武装日本
    本报特约记者富振声报道：东北各大中城市，自四月初以来，已逐步开展了大规模的响应世界和平理事会决议及普及深入抗美援朝的宣传运动。各地工厂在这一运动中并结合进行了爱国主义大竞赛、保安大检查等工作。据锦州、哈尔滨、旅大、齐齐哈尔、安东、沈阳、抚顺、鞍山、营口、西安、阜新、四平、牡丹江等十四个城市统计，共组织了报告员一千六百余名（部分地区的厂矿报告员未计算在内），先后进行了二千八百多次报告，听众约有一百二十万人以上；宣传员二万五千六百余人（部分地区厂矿和街道宣传员未计算在内），全部参加了活动。机关支部的宣传员普遍在街道居民中进行宣传活动。如齐齐哈尔市，有省、市机关支部宣传员六百六十七人进行宣传；沈阳和平区有六百多名机关支部宣传员参加宣传活动，最多的已宣传十次以上，最少的也宣传了一次。此外，该市还组织了临时宣传队二万多人，深入街道及市郊农村进行宣传。在哈尔滨市，临时宣传队共有一万零二百多人（包括机关干部、学生等）；锦州市亦有二千多人参加。由于宣传员报告员发挥了作用，并组织了大量的临时宣传队，目前东北地区各大中城市抗美援朝宣传教育工作，正在蓬勃展开。多数地区正发动群众控诉日、美强盗和蒋匪的罪恶暴行。通过控诉，群众的旧恨新仇，就自然地集中到美帝国主义身上。旅大市公营工厂中普遍组织了控诉运动。抚顺市已组织一百一十次控诉，有二万二千人参加。阜新市也有二万七千人参加控诉。锦州市已举行控诉会七百四十六次，有三千七百五十八人上台控诉，十一万五千多人参加大会。此外，该市并组织了一次广播控诉大会，有二千多人参加，四十多人要求上台控诉。与大会同时，有三百五十个收听小组组织收听群众达十万人，参加会议的和收听广播的群众情绪均十分激愤。收听小组当场自动捐献了人民币五百九十四万元，东北币七百八十七万元。教员克志玉，当场将金戒指捐献出来，慰问人民志愿军。齐齐哈尔市亦于四月二十日举行广播控诉大会，有近两万人参加。部分地区与控诉同时举行了拥护缔结和平公约的签名，和反对美国武装日本的投票。多数地区按不同单位，不同行业，不同阶层，分别签订了爱国公约。经过这次抗美援朝宣传，显然大大推进了各项工作。旅大全市自从展开抗美援朝宣传以来，先后出现了三百九十个先进生产小组，据该市八个工厂统计，百分之九十五以上的职工参加了生产竞赛。抚顺露天矿这次宣传教育开展得好，使得保安大检查顺利完成。经过这次宣传运动，在大中城市中，已消灭了许多宣传工作上的空白点。例如，锦州全市的空白点，在四月初有百分之二十，四月中旬减到百分之十，四月十八日以后，经过广播控诉大会和小型控诉会以后，全市空白点最多不过百分之五。齐齐哈尔市二十万人口中，原有七千三百多人未受过抗美援朝爱国教育，现在减到二千一百多人，约占全市人口百分之一。但在小城市及农村中，抗美援朝宣传运动要做到真正普及，还需要作严重的努力。
