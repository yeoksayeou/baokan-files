Farmers of Heiqiao Village in the Suburbs of Beijing Jointly Accuse Local Tyrant Landlords

The entire body of farmers from Heiqiao Village, outside Dongzhimen in Beijing, have jointly accused the village's local tyrant landlords, Song Wantian, Song Jutian, and Song Shaoyuan. They have also sent representatives to the Beijing People's Court, requesting the government to severely punish the aforementioned counter-revolutionary elements according to the law.

Song Wantian, nicknamed "Living阎王" (阎王 is the King of Hell), served as the head of the puppet seventh village joint defense during the period of Japanese occupation. He had over thirty police bodyguards in his home. With a glare, he could order anyone to be beaten or detained.

In 1945, Japan surrendered, and the People's Liberation Army arrived. The farmers of Heiqiao Village were emancipated, and eighty-five farmhands organized to reason with the landlords through struggle. Song Wantian's power collapsed. He was forced to give the farmhands 1,000 catties of supplementary rice, but he harbored resentment and was determined to retaliate.

When the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang launched a large-scale civil war, Heiqiao Village was occupied by Chiang's bandit troops. This gave Song Wantian an opportunity for revenge. He colluded with Chiang's bandit troops and the puppet Eastern Suburb Branch Bureau to arrest village cadres such as He Jiting. He Jiting had worked as a farmhand in his house and was a village cadre when the People's Liberation Army was present. Song Wantian hated He Jiting and was willing to spend millions to buy his life. After being arrested, He was transferred from the puppet police station to the puppet garrison command, where he was subjected to severe torture, including being pressed under a wooden bar and burned with flint strikers, nearly losing his life.

Not satisfied with arresting He Jiting, Song Wantian was determined to bring the farmers of Heiqiao Village to their knees. Song Wantian then turned his attention to the farmer Song Zhentian. Song Zhentian had also worked as a farmhand for him and received supplementary rice from him. He forced Song Zhentian to make up for the labor, saying, "You want my supplementary rice, and I want you to make up for the labor." But Song Zhentian's family had nothing to eat, and he himself was sick, so he had to beg Song Wantian to lend him some grain to support his family. Song Wantian's face darkened, and he refused to lend it. Song Zhentian was hungry and sick and could not support himself. Song Wantian still refused to allow him to rest, forcing him to work. Song Zhentian died of a combination of anger and illness.

Song Jutian, like Song Wantian, was full of cunning and was nicknamed "Little Zhuge Liang" (Zhuge Liang was a famous strategist). He devised ways to exploit the poor. He always used a large measure to take in grain and a small measure to give it out. Tenant farmers had to pay him an extra ten catties of firewood per mu of land. The poor not only suffered his various oppressions but also had to endure his insults and beatings. In 1918, farmhand Chen Tai was beaten by him with whips, sticks and jujube branches until he was covered in blood. Not only that, this "Little Zhuge Liang" also sprinkled alkali on Chen Tai's body under the pretext of applying medicine, causing Chen Tai excruciating pain.

In 1945, when the People's Liberation Army was present, he also gave out supplementary rice. Just a few days before Chiang's bandit troops occupied Heiqiao Village, he gathered twelve reactionary landlords at his home to hold a meeting to plan a counter-settlement.

Song Shaoyuan graduated from the puppet senior police academy and served as a henchman for the Japanese invaders. He once induced fifty-eight poor people from this village to go to the Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine to work as coolies for the Japanese invaders and deducted their resettlement fees.

In 1948, when Song Shaoyuan was the instructor of the 12th Brigade of the puppet Beiping Self-Defense Force, he extorted and levied taxes, extorting money from the people. The surrounding villages hated him. He colluded with Nie Dongchen, the head of the puppet Sunhe Town militia, forcing villagers to pay fifteen catties of grain per mu of land. Song Shaoyuan then levied a second grain tax, stipulating twenty-five catties per mu of land, to be paid within a specified period. Anyone who paid even slightly late would be arrested and imprisoned, and would also be beaten and punished.

The things that Song Shaoyuan did to harm the people are countless. He could do anything bad. He abducted the daughter-in-law of Song Shaogang, a farmer in this village, and her whereabouts are still unknown. On the night of the tenth day of the second lunar month in 1948, Song Shaoyuan, together with the puppet Beiping 20th District Suburban Eighth Branch Bureau, arrested Zhu Yuliang, severely tortured him, and then shot him. Zhu Yuliang made a living driving a cart and was a kind and honest person. To this day, his family still does not know why Zhu Yuliang was shot.

These three local tyrant landlords are guilty of heinous crimes and have caused great suffering to the people. Today, the people have been emancipated and have stood up, demanding justice and revenge. The farmers of Heiqiao Village wrote in their indictment: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we, the entire body of farmers of Heiqiao, have stood up in front of the landlords through the land reform movement. Although we have now been emancipated and become masters, the hatred of the past is unbearable. The crimes of these three should be severely punished."

### 北京郊区黑桥村农民  联名控告恶霸地主

　　北京郊区黑桥村农民  联名控告恶霸地主
    北京东直门外黑桥村农民全体联名控告该村恶霸地主宋万田、宋巨田、宋绍元，并推派代表到北京市人民法院，请求政府将上列反革命分子严惩法办。
    宋万田，绰号“活阎王”在日伪统治时期，充任伪七村联保长。他家里有三十几个警察保镖。他把眼一翻，说打谁就打谁，说扣押谁就扣押谁。
    一九四五年，日本投降，解放军来了。黑桥村的农民翻了身，八十五个长工组织起来向地主进行说理斗争。宋万田的势力垮了。他迫不得已给长工拿出一千斤补给米，可是怀恨在心，下决心要报复。
    蒋介石匪帮发动了大规模内战，黑桥村被蒋匪军占了。这一来，宋万田可有了报复的机会。他勾结蒋匪军和伪东郊分局抓走村干部何济亭等。何济亭在他家里做过长工，解放军在的时候，是村干部。宋万田把何济亭恨透了，愿意花几百万元买掉何的一条性命。何被捕后，由伪警察局转到伪警备司令部，压杠子，打火镰把，几次严刑拷打，几乎丧命。
    抓走了何济亭，宋万田还不满足，非要把黑桥村的农民给制个死去活来不可。宋万田回头就收拾农民宋珍田。宋珍田也是给他当过长工，得过他的补给米的。他逼着宋珍田补工，他说：“你要老子的补给米，老子就要你补工。”可是宋珍田家里没吃，自己身体也有病，只好央告宋万田借给一点粮食养养家。宋万田把脸一沉，不借。宋珍田又饿又病，支持不了。宋万田仍不准他休息，强迫他干活。宋珍田就这样连气带病的死了。
    宋巨田，和宋万田一样，鬼计多端，外号“小诸葛”，他想着法儿剥削穷人。他总是以大斗进小斗出，租田户得额外按每亩地给他纳柴十斤。穷人不但受他的各种压榨，而且还得受他的辱骂和毒打。一九一八年，长工陈台被他用鞭棍和枣树枝打得满身是血，这还不算，这个“小诸葛”还以上药为名，往陈台身上撒碱面，痛得陈台死去活来。
    一九四五年解放军在时，他也拿出过补给米。就在蒋匪军侵占黑桥村的不多几天，他召集反动地主十二名到自己家里来开会，策划倒算。
    宋绍元在伪高等警官学校毕业，为日寇充当爪牙。他曾为日寇在本村诱骗穷人五十八名去宣化龙烟铁矿作苦力，并从中克扣安家费。
    一九四八年，宋绍元当伪北平自卫队十二中队的教官时，强征暴敛，勒索民财。远近乡里，莫不切齿痛恨。他与伪孙河镇壮丁队长聂栋臣勾串，强迫村民每亩地出粮十五斤。宋绍元又征第二次粮。规定每亩地二十五斤，限期交齐。谁交得稍迟就被抓来禁闭，还要挨打受罚。
    宋绍元坑害老百姓的事情是数不清的。什么坏事他都干得出来，他把本村农民宋绍刚的儿媳给拐跑了，直到现在还无下落。一九四八年旧历二月初十的夜间，宋绍元会同伪北平市第二十区郊八分局将朱玉良逮捕起来，严刑拷讯后枪毙了。朱玉良平日赶大车为生，是一个良善的老百姓，一直到今天，他家里的人还不知道朱玉良是为什么被枪杀的。
    这三个恶霸地主罪大恶极，害苦了老百姓。今天老百姓翻了身，站起来了，要求伸冤报仇。黑桥村的农民在控诉书里写道：“我黑桥全体农民在共产党领导下，经过土地改革运动，在地主面前站起来了。现在虽然翻了身，当了主人，但以往的仇恨实在难忍，该三人的罪恶理应受到严惩。”
