　　Seriously Handle Letters from the Masses

　　The "Decision on Handling Mass Issues" issued by the Hebei Provincial People's Government is an important measure for the People's Government to connect with the broad masses. After the Hebei Provincial People's Government made this decision and put it into practice, within a month, it received eighty-three letters from the masses concerning work suggestions, reports on counter-revolutionary elements, cadre work styles, production conditions, and the people's lives. These valuable opinions directly from the masses played a significant role in helping the government understand the situation, improve its work, and educate cadres.

　　All government agencies should handle the issues raised by the masses very seriously. Therefore, the bureaucratic work style displayed by some government agencies on this issue is intolerable. They treat the opinions put forward by the masses with a perfunctory attitude, sometimes even shelving them, which cuts off the connection between the government and the people. The measures taken by the Hebei Provincial People's Government are a good start, and the people's governments in various regions should learn from them well. We should correct the thinking of cadres, establish necessary systems, and seriously handle letters from the masses in order to strengthen the connection between the government and the people.

　　认真处理群众的来信
    河北省人民政府所发布的“关于处理群众问题的决定”，是人民政府联系广大群众的一个重要的措施。河北省人民政府作出此项决定，并付诸实施后，在一个月内，就收到群众有关工作建议、检举反革命分子、干部作风、生产情况、群众生活等来信八十三件。这些直接来自群众的宝贵意见，对于帮助政府了解情况，改进工作，以及教育干部，都起了很大的作用。
    所有政府机关都应该十分认真地处理群众提出的问题。因此，某些政府机关在这个问题上表现的官僚主义作风是不能容忍的。他们以一种敷衍塞责的态度对待群众提出的意见，有时甚至搁置不理，这样就杜绝了政府与人民之间的联系。河北省人民政府这种措施是一个良好的开端，各地人民政府应该很好地学习。应该端正干部的思想，定出必要的制度，认真处理群众的来信，以加强政府与人民的联系。
