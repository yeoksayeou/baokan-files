　　Reading "Defender of Peace"
　　Wu Qian
　　In the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, it is gratifying that literary authors are creating works full of patriotic ideas. And some excellent works have been produced, but there are still not enough. Some are written relatively superficially, lacking profound ideological content.
　　Recently, I read Comrade Yu Lin's "Defender of Peace" (published by the Central South People's Publishing House). I think this is a work with more ideological content. It not only depicts the ferocious face of American imperialism, but also praises the awakening of the people and the dignity of the motherland, thus making this work have a relatively deep patriotic ideology.
　　After the end of World War II in 1945, American imperialism inherited the mantle of the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists, plotting to monopolize the world and vainly attempting to turn China into its military base, actively encouraging and supporting the Kuomintang to fight a civil war with manpower, material resources, and financial resources. The participation of American imperialists in the work of the "Military Mediation Execution Department" was precisely using the guise of mediating China's civil war to sabotage China's peace and open the way for the Kuomintang to fight a civil war. "Defender of Peace" profoundly and vividly exposed the conspiracy of American imperialism in the "Military Mediation Department," and through the description of various behaviors of American imperialism colluding with the Kuomintang, the aggressive nature of American imperialism was more fully exposed.
　　When the American-made planes of the Kuomintang came to strafe, the Communist Party representative pointed out that this was a serious act of sabotage of peace, while the Kuomintang representative and the American imperialist representative deliberately called black white, deliberately delayed, and obstructed the solution of the problem, even sophistically saying:
　　Gao Yasheng (Kuomintang representative) spread his hands and said: "Representative Zhang, I'm sorry, I didn't go out to see it, I can't determine whether it's a National Party plane."
　　Zhang Huaping (Communist Party representative) said with a沉下脸: "Representative Gao, what do you mean? Can't you prove whose plane it is if you didn't see it? Colonel Harris (American representative) saw it, he can prove it."
　　Harris said coldly: "I saw a Kuomintang emblem."
　　…
　　Gao Yasheng turned his face and said calmly: "But the American Colonel didn't say it was a National Party plane, did he?"
　　Harris shrugged and said: "All I can say is that."
　　In this case, you see how cunning the American representative is! However, when the Kuomintang bandit army crossed the border and attacked the liberated areas and suffered a fatal blow from our army, Harris demanded to go to the conflict site immediately, "immediately summon the commander of the Chinese Communists, and ask him to immediately stop the attack." In this case, you see how "active" he is!
　　When the Kuomintang occupied Chengde not long after, a large-scale war broke out, Harris suddenly said: "We are preparing to withdraw." At that time, the translator Liu Chengren asked Harris: "Can we only talk idly before the war breaks out, and withdraw after the war breaks out?" Harris replied: "We have completed our mission." What "mission" did he "complete"? That is: they have opened the way for the Kuomintang to fight a civil war, and they have transported troops and ammunition to the front line of the civil war for the Kuomintang.
　　But all of these are not explained by concepts, but expressed through images—characters, plots, thoughts, and feelings. The development of the plot of "Defender of Peace" has the power to convince people precisely because it is composed of the mutual contact and mutual relationship of several characters—representatives of several group interests. In the work, all the characters act and speak on behalf of their group interests, so the development of the plot is the development of sharp contradictions. Because the author more profoundly describes these contradictions, the true faces of the various groups are clearly exposed to the readers.
　　Who is the true defender of peace? Who is wearing the mask of "mediation" but actually engaging in the conspiracy to create a civil war in China? The novel "Defender of Peace" has clearly given a powerful answer to the readers.
　　The protagonist of the novel, Liu Chengren, is precisely the eyewitness and witness to these conspiracies. He has always been in favor of the United States. When he was in college, he had a dream of studying in the United States. He has a vague patriotic idea. After Japan surrendered, he was very confused when he saw the civil war in China. Later, when he heard that Marshall came to mediate the civil war, he was very happy and thought that "with the United States mediating, the Chinese problem is solved." So he resigned from his teaching position and wanted to contribute to the cause of peace, so he decided to go to the American side of the Military Mediation Department as a translator. His creed was: "Neither biased towards the Kuomintang nor biased towards the Communist Party, I will objectively observe everything."
　　Liu Chengren pinned all his hopes on the Americans, but after he witnessed many facts with his own eyes, he realized that what American imperialism and the Kuomintang were directing was originally a "trap" trick, and then he realized that he was too naive and too naive. His hope for the United States gradually changed from suspicion and disappointment to hatred of American imperialism.
　　However, Liu Chengren's ideological change process was not a simple one-time change, but a gradual correction after a tortuous inner struggle and the lessons of facts.
　　At the beginning, Liu Chengren was still very optimistic about the mediation. After he arrived at the execution team and saw the memorandums of both sides, a shadow began to cover his heart, but he thought, "Both sides are wrong, arguing endlessly for a hillside and a village, isn't this争夺私人权利?" After the incident of the Changchengling bandit army invading our岔道村, he experienced the entire "mediation" process. He not only realized that the United States had no sincerity in mediation, but also clearly realized that "they (the Kuomintang) falsely accused the other side of attacking, but in fact they were attacking others." However, he was still very happy because he saw that the American temporary representative was still very fair. But when the official American representative Harris returned to the team, this fair temporary representative McDonald (he was originally an engineer, a democrat, who voluntarily asked to come for the sake of China's peace) was suddenly transferred away, and was reprimanded by Harris: "Ceasefire? Peace? What the hell! Who told you to say such silly things?" At this time, Liu Chengren had not yet suspected that the United States' purpose in participating in the Military Mediation Department was ulterior motives. He only thought: "It is inevitable that there will always be unfair people," "People like Harris and Gao Yasheng are ultimately a minority." Later, he learned from the mouths of other American translators in the group that "all crows in the world are black," and that the American representatives of each group have such a rule, that is: "Whenever the Kuomintang beats the Communist Party, the American representative does not say a word, as long as the Communist Party fights back, the Americans shout to mediate." At this time, he realized the true face of American imperialism, and the hope he had placed on the United States was completely shattered.
　　But he was not discouraged. Although he witnessed the Kuomintang reactionaries' various shameful acts of betraying the country, and the special agent behavior of the American representatives colluding with the pastors to steal intelligence, he also saw the awakening of the people in the liberated areas, and saw the light and hope. In the liberated areas, he felt the dignity of the motherland and heard the voice of the motherland. This was precisely the important force that prompted him to resolutely leave the execution team and plunge into the revolutionary torrent.
　　Are there not still some people who still have the remnants of pro-American, worship-American, and flatter-American thoughts? Are there not still some people who have many confused views on the United States? The truth revealed by "Defender of Peace" through historical events will have a little "sobering" effect on these people.
　　After reading "Defender of Peace," I was reminded of the patriotic people who heroically sacrificed in the War of Liberation and the tens of thousands of compatriots who were slaughtered, and also remembered our countless slaughtered brothers, sisters, and children. These bloody tragedies were all directed by American imperialism, and were all caused by him wearing the mask of "mediation." We will always remember this blood feud in our hearts: blood debts must be repaid with blood!
　　This is the thematic significance of "Defender of Peace." It makes us love our motherland more, and at the same time generates deep hatred for the American aggressors.
　　The author can choose the characteristics of American imperialism from this historical event and describe these characteristics from all sides, which is related to the author's life. Comrade Yu Lin was a translator of the Chinese Communist Party delegation to the execution department at that time, directly participating in the work of the Zhangjiakou execution team, and often traveled between Beijing and Zhangjiakou. Moreover, he was in contact and struggle with American imperialist elements every day, and he was learning about them and studying them every day. This is probably the important reason why "Defender of Peace" can write more profoundly about the inside story of American imperialists in the execution department.
　　But "Defender of Peace" is not without shortcomings. For example, the personality of some characters is not prominent enough; for example, the description of some lives inserted to influence Liu Chengren's awakening is not very natural, and so on. It is said that Comrade Yu Lin is now planning to write a second work with the execution department as the theme. We hope that these shortcomings will no longer appear in his second work.

### 读《和平的保卫者》

　　读《和平的保卫者》
　　吴倩
    在抗美援朝保家卫国的运动中，文艺作者以无比的热情，创作着富有爱国主义思想的作品，这现象是可喜的。而且也产生了一些优秀的作品，但毕竟还不够多。有些也写得比较表面，缺少深刻的思想内容。
    最近读到了俞林同志的《和平的保卫者》（中南人民出版社出版）我以为这是一篇较有思想内容的作品，它把不仅美国帝国主义的狞恶面貌描画出来，同时也歌颂了人民的觉醒，和祖国的尊严，因而使这篇作品具有比较深刻的爱国主义思想。
    一九四五年第二次世界大战结束后，美国帝国主义继承了德意日法西斯的衣钵，阴谋独占世界，妄想变中国为它的军事基地，积极地以人力、物力、财力鼓励和支持国民党打内战。美帝国主义者参加“军事调处执行部”的工作，就正是拿着调处中国内战的幌子，进行破坏中国的和平，为国民党开辟内战的道路。《和平的保卫者》深刻地生动地揭露了美帝国主义在“军调部”的阴谋勾当，并通过美帝国主义和国民党狼狈为奸的各种行为的描写，美帝国主义的侵略本质得到较充分的暴露。
    当国民党的美国制造的飞机来扫射的时候，共产党代表指出这是严重的破坏和平的行为，而国民党的代表与美帝国主义的代表指黑为白，有意拖延，阻挠解决问题，竟这样狡赖着：
    高亚声（国民党代表）两手一摊说：“张代表，对不起，我没有出去看，我不能断定它是国方的飞机，”
    张化平（共产党代表）沉下脸说：“高代表，你这是什么意思？你没有看到就不能证明那方面的飞机吗？哈利斯（美方代表）上校看到了，他可以证明。”
    哈利斯冷冷的说：“我看到了有国民党徽。”
    ……
    高亚声一扭脸，不动声色的说：“但是美国上校并没有说是国方的飞机，不是吗？”
    哈利斯一耸肩说：“我能说的只是那一点。”
    在这情况下，你看，美国代表是多么狡猾！然而，当国民党匪军越过边界，向解放区进攻遭到我军的致命打击时，哈利斯却要求马上到冲突地点，“立即召见中共指挥官，请他立即停止进攻”。在这种情况下，你看，他又是多么“积极”！
    当国民党侵占了承德后不久，大规模的战争暴发了，哈利斯突然说：“我们准备撤退”，当时，译员刘诚仁向哈利斯发问道：“难道在战争爆发前我们只能空谈，战争爆发之后，我们就撤走吗？”哈利斯回答说：“我们已经完成了任务。”他所“完成”的是什么“任务”呢？那就是：他们已经替国民党开辟了内战的道路，他们已经替国民党把军队与弹药运送到内战前线。
    但所有这些，都不是用概念来说明，而是通过形象——人物、情节、思想、感情表现出来的。《和平的保卫者》的情节的发展，所以具有使人信服的力量，就正因为它通过几种人物——几个集团利益的代表者——的互相接触与互相关系所构成。在作品里，各种人物都是代表着他的集团利益去行动、去说话的，因此情节的发展就是矛盾尖锐对立的发展，由于作者比较深刻地描写了这些矛盾，因而各集团的真实面貌就鲜明地暴露在读者的面前。
    谁是真正的和平的保卫者？谁是戴着“调处”假面具而实际上干着制造中国内战勾当的人呢？《和平的保卫者》这小说，已经很清楚的向读者作了有力的回答。
    小说的主人公刘诚仁，正是这些阴谋的目击者和见证人。他本来一向赞成美国，在大学读书的时候，曾做过留学美国的梦，他有一种朦胧的爱国思想。日本投降之后，见中国发生了内战，他非常迷惑。后来听说马歇尔来调停内战，他高兴极了，认为“有美国来调停，中国问题算是解决了”。于是他辞了教员职位，想为和平事业出一份力量，遂决心到军调部美方当译员，他的信条是：“既不偏袒国民党，也不偏袒共产党，我一定客观地观察一切。”
    刘诚仁把全部希望寄托在美国人的身上，可是当他亲眼目击了许多事实之后，发现美国帝国主义与国民党所导演的，原来是一出“圈套”把戏之后，他才认识自己太幼稚，太天真了。他对美国所抱的希望，逐渐由怀疑、失望而变成对美帝国主义的憎恨。
    但是刘诚仁的思想变化过程，不是简单的一下子变化的，而是经过曲折的内心斗争、经过事实的教训，逐步的纠正过来的。
    开始刘诚仁对调处还很乐观，等他到了执行小组看到双方的备忘录之后，在他心里开始遮上了一层阴影，不过他认为“双方都不对，为一个山坡、一个村庄争执不休，这不是争夺私人权利吗？”当长城岭匪军向我岔道村侵犯的事件发生后，他经历了全部的“调处”过程，他不仅认识了美国对调处毫无诚意，而且清楚地认识了“他们（国民党）诬告对方进攻，实际上是他们进攻别人”。不过，他还很高兴，因为看到美国的临时代表还很公正。可是当美国正式代表哈利斯回到小组后，这位公正的临时代表麦唐纳（他原是一个工程师，民主派，为了中国的和平，自愿要求来的。）忽然被调走了，而且被哈利斯训斥了一顿：“停战？和平？什么鬼！谁让你说出这种傻话？”这时，刘诚仁还不曾怀疑美国参加军调部的目的是别有用心，他仅仅认为：“不大公正的人总难免”、“像哈利斯和高亚声这些人，究竟是少数。”后来他从其他小组美方译员的嘴里，才知道“天下老鸦一般黑”，才知道各小组的美国代表却有这么一套规律，就是：“凡是国民党打共产党，美国代表不吭气，共产党只要一还手，美国人就嚷着去调处。”到这时候，他才认识了美国帝国主义的真面目，对美国所寄予的希望才完全破灭。
    但他并没有灰心，虽然他目击了国民党反动派的种种可耻的卖国勾当，和美国代表串通牧师窃取情报等特务行为，但他同时也看到了解放区人民的觉醒，看到光明与希望，他在解放区感到祖国尊严，听到祖国的声音，这正是促使他毅然决然地离开了执行小组，投身到革命洪流里的重要力量。
    现在有些人不是依然还有亲美、崇美、媚美的思想残渣吗？不是依然有些人对美国存在着许多糊涂看法吗？《和平的保卫者》通过历史事件所揭露出来的真实，是会对这些人起一点“清醒剂”的作用的。
    读了《和平的保卫者》，使我记起在解放战争中英勇牺牲了的爱国志士和成千成万被杀戮了的同胞，也想起了我们无数被杀戮的兄弟姊妹和孩子，这些血腥的惨剧，都是美帝国主义所导演的，都是他戴着“调处”的假面具所造成的。我们对这血海深仇，将永远铭记在心里：血债必须以血来偿还！
    这就是《和平的保卫者》的主题意义。它使我们更热爱我们的祖国，同时对美国侵略者产生了刻骨的仇恨。
    作者能从这历史事件中，选择了美帝国主义的特征，并从各个侧面去描写这些特征，与作者的生活是有关系的。俞林同志是当时执行部中共代表团的译员，直接参加张家口执行小组的工作，常往返于北平、张家口两个城市。而且每日都与美帝国主义分子相接触、相斗争，每日都在了解他们，研究他们。这大概正是《和平的保卫者》能够较深刻地写出美帝国主义者在执行部的内幕的重要原因。
    但《和平的保卫者》并不是没有缺点，譬如，某些人物个性还不够突出；譬如，为影响刘诚仁觉醒所插入的某些生活的描写，还不十分自然等等。据说俞林同志现在正计划写第二部以执行部为题材的作品，我们希望他的第二部作品中，这些缺点不再出现。
