Xinhua News Agency, 19th: According to a TASS report on the 14th: United Press reported that Japanese labor unions are actively participating in the movement to strive for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and oppose the rearmament of Japan. The National Monopoly Bureau Employees' Union has decided to collect 400,000 signatures for a declaration demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, and has started this work in various regions of Japan since April 1st.

　　The union issued a statement saying: Most Japanese people oppose war. However, a small group of politicians and capitalists, disregarding the will of the Japanese people, support the conclusion of a separate peace treaty with Japan and the rearmament of Japan. The statement said: We should stand up to oppose war, therefore, we should demand the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and oppose the rearmament of Japan.

　　In Osaka, young people and women participating in the All-Japan National Railway Workers' Union organized demonstrations under the slogan of opposing war. The participants in the march distributed leaflets among the residents of the city demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and protesting against the establishment of military bases and the rearmament of Japan in Japan.

　　The Fukuoka Prefectural Organizing Committee of the Comprehensive Peace Patriotic Movement Council held a meeting in Fukuoka City. Representatives from more than 30 organizations participated in the meeting. The meeting passed a resolution to collect two million signatures for a declaration demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, and protested against the rearmament of Japan. In Fukuoka Prefecture, 63,288 people have already signed the declaration demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: According to a TASS report, the strike movement of Japanese workers demanding higher wages and improved working conditions is expanding. The wave of strikes initiated by electrical workers under the initiative of the National Electrical Industry Workers' Union has now spread throughout Japan. Electrical workers are demanding a 30% wage increase. The "Nippon Express" (transportation company) Workers' Union, which has 110,000 members, is also fighting for wage increases. 1,300 workers at the four factories of Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Machine Manufacturing Company in Tokyo, Funabashi, Kawasaki, and Tsurumi went on strike for two weeks, demanding higher wages. Under the workers' persistent struggle, the factory was forced to concede, agreeing to raise wages and shorten working hours.

　　Not long ago, 940 workers at the "Teikoku Rolling Stock Manufacturing" company in Sakai City (in Osaka) went on strike for eight days, and workers at the "Qing Tong" (transliteration) train carriage manufacturing company (in Hyogo Prefecture) went on strike for 24 hours. Workers at the Muroran factory (in Hokkaido) of "Nippon Steel" company went on strike for 16 hours. All striking workers demanded higher wages.
