　　Resolutely Purging Counter-Revolutionary Elements to Pave the Way for Democratic Reform
    ——One of the Work Introductions of Shijingshan Power Plant
    By our reporter Ai Fang
    Shijingshan Power Plant is one of the largest power plants in the country. It was established in 1920 and has a history of thirty years. Shijingshan was liberated on December 17, 1948, and the plant began a new era. However, the working class truly gained freedom of development ideologically and politically and became the masters of the factory after the purging of counter-revolutionary elements, the establishment of the party's leading core, and the party's gaining dominance among the masses.

    At the beginning of the takeover, the military representatives sent by the electric power company did not know how to rely on the workers to manage the enterprise. On the one hand, they emphasized military management and did not conduct mass work among the workers. On the other hand, they simply relied on the old institutions and personnel, using the excuse of "not breaking the original institutions" and abandoning the work of mobilizing the workers and carrying out democratic reforms. A large number of bad people in the factory were retained and controlled the main production departments. The workers expressed dissatisfaction with this. But at that time, except for a few activists, most people dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out. In September 1949, the largest generator in the plant, No. 6, was damaged. This was a serious blow and threat to the production and lives of the workers at Shijingshan Power Plant. The workers said, "Damaging No. 6 machine is like half the sky falling." The destruction of No. 6 machine made the leading cadres begin to realize that there were serious problems in the work, but at that time their minds were not clear. They did not raise the resolute struggle against the sabotage of production by special agents and counter-revolutionary elements to an important position.

    What was the political situation of the Shijingshan employees at that time?

    Before liberation, under the long-term rule and oppression of the enemy, the workers of Shijingshan had waged heroic and brutal struggles. The underground party organization and members of the Chinese Communist Party were the leading core of the struggle. The current Deputy Director Wang Wenbin, Union Chairman Liu Yusan and other comrades are excellent comrades of the underground party. These comrades fought alongside the masses, risking their lives during the rule of the enemy and puppets. After liberation, these comrades continued to lead the masses in democratic reform and the struggle to increase production.

    However, the political situation among another group of employees was very complicated. According to the statistics at the time: employees who had participated in reactionary parties and groups accounted for 27% of the total number of employees (the factory had the "Kuomintang Beiping 49th District Party Headquarters," with eight branch offices and thirty-one groups). There were more than ten reactionary organizations controlled and used by special agents, such as the "Anti-Communist Vanguard," "Anti-Spy Group," and the puppet "Trade Union." Those who participated in Yiguandao accounted for 18.7% of the total number of employees in the factory. Most of these people were forced to join. The leading elements who had relied on their power to bully the masses, resolutely opposed the revolution, and owed blood debts to the people also accounted for a considerable number. The workers hated the counter-revolutionary elements; however, because the counter-revolutionary elements used the backward superstition and guild gang mentality of the masses to create some muddled ideas, they also caused the masses' understanding of the counter-revolutionary elements to be blurred. The leading cadres sent to the factory at that time did not seriously rely on the leading backbone of the Shijingshan Party organization to further understand the political situation of the masses. Although they also ordered the reactionary parties and groups to register, they did not sort out and study the registered materials, but only sent the important counter-revolutionary elements Cao Guangjun, Zhao Guiyong, and Lu Junfeng out for training. They thought that everything was fine. In fact, many elements who had participated in reactionary parties and groups in the past and had bullied the masses without bowing their heads were still holding important positions in the administrative departments of the factory and even in the trade union. Many counter-revolutionary elements continued to hide and carry out sabotage activities.

    Here, a few examples can be given to illustrate this serious situation.

    The murderer (local tyrant) Zhang Quan, from Beilang Village, Shunyi County, Hebei Province. In 1947, when the village cadre Wen Jinbao and others led the masses to brew an anti-corruption struggle (at that time the village was a guerrilla zone), the counter-revolutionary elements Zhang Quan and Zhang Hongkui killed eight of our village cadres and activists and injured three others. Later, they sneaked into the Shijingshan Power Plant. After liberation, they carried out secret sabotage activities.

    The counter-revolutionary element Li Xiutian (Kuomintang member, Anti-Communist Vanguard member, rogue) bullied the masses before liberation, often carried a pistol on his waist, searched households at night, and raped women. After liberation, he still did not know how to repent, and once destroyed the boiler four times in a row in one night: first, he opened the high-pressure furnace's large water tank door, trying to drain the water and cause a major boiler accident; second, he burned the gate red and splashed it with cold water, causing the gate to break; third, he closed the boiler's main air door, causing the steam pressure to drop; fourth, he released oil from the No. 15 stoker.

    Yiguandao "Dian Chuan Shi" (Initiator) Yang Yuqing, when he was a foreman in the Shijingshan boiler workshop, used the methods of "summoning gods" and "planchette writing" to systematically compile a large number of rumors (aiming at the current situation and our propaganda center, since liberation, he has compiled two bundles of reactionary "planchette writing" and explanations), undermining the prestige of the Party and the People's Government.

  Struggling Against Erroneous Views

    At that time, the leading cadres had some extremely erroneous views for a long time: such as a one-sided mass viewpoint, believing that "they are all workers, where do the special agents come from"! When comrades doing security work proposed establishing some necessary procedures for workers to enter and leave the factory, they were criticized as "being divorced from the masses"; some people also had a purely technical viewpoint and did not dare to review the complex situation of employees, especially old technical personnel, fearing that "people would not work anymore," fearing trouble, and fearing the loss of technical reliance. This unprincipled accommodation of backward thinking created a great gap for counter-revolutionary elements to operate. At that time, some comrades, seeing that things were not going well, reminded the leaders to pay attention to special agent activities, but they were ridiculed as "worriers."

    After the No. 6 generator of the plant was damaged, the military representative and the director of the plant were both dismissed, but because the masses were not mobilized to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, the serious political situation of the plant continued to exist. During the repair of No. 6 machine, it was discovered that wood had been stuffed into the rotor inside the machine for sabotage. At this time, the higher-level party committee began to be alert to the fact that the Shijingshan Power Plant had been repeatedly sabotaged and demanded that the factory conduct a serious inspection. Cadres and employee activists also raised the demand to purge counter-revolutionary elements, but the leading cadres (including the director at the time) still hesitated. These comrades did not oppose purging bad people head-on, but were frightened by difficulties, showing a kind of helpless look towards the instructions of the higher authorities and the demands of the masses. They said: "It is political risk to not transfer these people out, it won't work. It is a technical risk to transfer these people out, it won't work either." Neither this nor that works, unable to make a decision. However, most cadres and party members agreed with the higher-level party committee on this issue. They called on the masses to defend the factory, oppose sabotage, seize all the sabotage facts of counter-revolutionary elements, tell the masses, and use all gatherings to carry out propaganda, improve the masses' political enthusiasm and vigilance against the enemy.

    In March 1950, the higher-level party committee resolutely refuted the views of some cadres of the Shijingshan Power Plant, such as "political risk, technical risk," and instructed them to purge bad people without wavering. The Shijingshan Party organization, in accordance with the instructions of the higher authorities, relied on party members and progressive masses to politically reorganize the ranks of the working class. A total of eighty-three people were purged this time, most of whom were counter-revolutionary elements ("Kuomintang District Branch Committee members" and below 23, "Anti-Communist Vanguard members" 12, Yiguandao leaders 6, and the rest were Chiang bandit officers, rogues, etc.). Later, some more were purged at the request of the employees, and a total of 134 people were purged before and after.

  Purging Bad Elements Transitions to Democratic Reform

    The removal of such a large number of saboteurs from the Shijingshan Power Plant was a great determination of the leadership, a decisive key to Shijingshan Power Plant embarking on the road of democratic reform, and a touchstone for the Party to let go of relying on the workers. People's eyes lit up. Party members, activists, and the broad masses raised their eyebrows and exhaled. When the purged bad elements left the factory and gathered, the workers said behind them: "Hey! Did you see that? Strings of loaches, all the same!" The workers began to have a clear line between revolution and counter-revolution. Worker Chao Boyu said: "Shijingshan was liberated in 1948, and I was liberated in 1950!" They also made an analogy, saying: "Our factory is like a person. If you dig out these bad flesh from this person, this person will be healthy!"

    This is a major event of Shijingshan being reborn. The workers still talk about it with great enthusiasm, believing that it was a great liberation for themselves and for the production cause of Shijingshan. Indeed, when Liu Daquan (who participated in the Kuomintang and still bullied workers after liberation) was the foreman of the plant's transportation yard, various tasks could not be implemented. When the trade union held elections, he forced the workers in the transportation yard to elect him. Under his obstruction, the study in the yard could not be carried out. When No. 6 machine was damaged, the workers in the yard were discussing it, and he first said: "I guarantee that there is not a single special agent in our factory," so that everyone did not dare to speak. At that time, the transportation yard was the largest yard in the plant, but the leaders of the plant could not transfer a single person from here. Since Liu Daquan was purged from the factory, the work efficiency of the transportation factory has doubled in a short period of time. Then, due to the efforts of all the workers in the yard, a bridge-type coal conveyor was renovated, and the work efficiency was six times higher than before.

    The cadres' general concept of the working class has also been reversed. They realized from the facts that they must eliminate the counter-revolutionary elements lurking in the working class in order to form a reliable working class team. After the counter-revolutionary elements were eliminated, the workers and party members of Shijingshan began to demand the re-election of the trade union as masters and establish a factory management committee to participate in enterprise management. The workers universally organized safety groups and carried out education on labor discipline. Once the enthusiasm of the masses was brought into play, a group of new technical forces immediately emerged, sufficient to master the main production departments. Among the original technical personnel, the progressives became more active, the intermediates were able to distinguish right from wrong, and the backward also began to move closer to progress. These facts shattered the erroneous ideas of technical adventure. Technology began to truly serve the people's production cause. All the work of Shijingshan Power Plant changed from passive to active. From the naked dancing of the leadership, it was involved in the enthusiastic mass production and democratic reform movement.

  Clear Conclusion

    It has been exactly one year from last March to now. Over the past year, the actual work of Shijingshan Power Plant has drawn a clear conclusion to the historical debate that once existed about whether or not to dare to eliminate bad elements.

    The work of purging bad elements at Shijingshan Power Plant was successful. From the current point of view, it is not without shortcomings. The main problem is that after the resolute purging, the factory leaders did not well combine the workers' vital interests to carry out accusations against counter-revolutionary elements and conduct systematic ideological education work. This defect was later made up for in the movement to resist the United States and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries. For those who have been purged, the judicial organs did not well mobilize the workers of Shijingshan to participate in the handling, and especially did not respect the opinions of the workers of Shijingshan Power Plant to severely punish those who were extremely guilty, and some were even assigned jobs. After a counter-revolutionary element was purged from the Shijingshan Power Plant, he was sent to work at the Datong Power Plant after being controlled, and as a result, he damaged the machines of the plant. This is a bloody lesson. The employees of Shijingshan still have opinions about the government when they mention this matter, believing that this is an unnecessary loss.

　　坚决清洗反革命分子为实行民主改革铺平道路
    ——石景山发电厂工作介绍之一
    本报记者  艾方
    石景山发电厂，是全国可数的大发电厂之一，该厂建立于一九二○年，到现在已有三十年的历史了。一九四八年十二月十七日石景山解放，该厂开始转入了一个新的时代，但工人阶级真正从思想上政治上获得自由的发展，成了工厂的主人，则是在清洗反革命分子，建立党的领导核心，和党在群众中取得优势之后。
    开始接收时，电业公司派去的军代表不懂得依靠工人管理企业。他们一方面强调军事管理，根本不去在工人中进行群众工作，另一方面单纯依赖旧的机构和人事，借口“不打破原机构”，放弃了发动工人、进行民主改革的工作。工厂内一大批坏人被保留下来，控制着生产主要部门。工人对此，表示不满。但在当时，除少数积极分子外，一般是敢怒而不敢言。一九四九年九月，该厂最大的一部发电机——六号机遭到破坏。这对于石景山发电厂的生产和工人生活是一个严重的打击和威胁，工人们说：“坏了六号机等于塌了半个天”。六号机的被破坏，使领导干部开始意识到工作是存在有严重问题的，但当时头脑并不清醒，对于如何同特务、反革命分子的危害生产现象进行坚决的斗争，并未提到重要地位上来。
    当时石景山职工中的政治状况是怎样呢？
    解放前，在敌人的长期统治压榨下，石景山工人曾进行英勇的残酷的斗争。中国共产党的地下党组织和党员是斗争的领导核心。现任副厂长王文斌、工会主任刘玉三等都是地下党优秀的同志。这些同志在敌伪统治时，出生入死同群众在一起进行战斗，解放后，这些同志继续领导群众进行民主改革和提高生产的斗争。
    但在另一部分职工中政治上却十分复杂。据当时的统计：该厂参加过反动党团的职工，占职工总数的百分之二十七（工厂中有“国民党北平四十九区党部”，下有八个区分部、三十一个小组）。为特务所掌握和利用的反动组织，有“清共先锋队”、“防奸组”、伪“工会”等十个以上。参加一贯道的占全厂职工总数的百分之十八点七。这些人，大部分是被强拉硬扯参加的，过去仗势欺压群众、坚决反革命并欠下人民血债的首要分子，也占相当人数。工人们对反革命分子是痛恨的；但，因为反革命分子利用群众中的落后迷信、行会帮口思想，制造出一些糊涂观念，也造成群众对反革命分子的认识上的模糊。当时派到工厂去的领导干部没有认真依靠石景山党组织的领导骨干，进一步了解群众政治状况。他们虽然也命令反动党团进行了登记；但对登记的材料并没有整理、研究，只是把重要的反革命分子曹广钧、赵贵庸、陆俊峰等，送出去受训。就认为万事大吉了。其实，有许多过去参加过反动党团并曾欺压过群众而没有向群众低头的分子，在工厂的行政部门，甚至在工会中还担任重要职务。有许多反革命分子，继续隐藏下来进行破坏活动。
    在这里，可以举几个例子来说明这一严重情况。
    杀人罪犯（恶霸地主）张全，河北顺义县北郎村人。一九四七年该村村干部闻进宝等领导群众酝酿反贪污斗争时（当时该村为游击区），反革命分子张全、张洪奎曾杀死我村干部、积极分子八人，打伤三人，后来潜入石景山发电厂。解放后，即进行秘密破坏活动。
    反革命分子李秀田（国民党员、清共先锋队员、流氓），解放前欺压群众，时常腰里插着手枪，夜间搜查户口，强奸妇女。解放后仍不知改悔，曾一夜连续四次破坏锅炉：第一次，把高压炉的大水箱门放开，企图把水放尽，造成锅炉重大事故；第二次，将闸板烧红后用冷水泼，使闸板破裂；第三次，把锅炉总风门关上，使汽压降低；第四次，把十五号司火机放油。
    一贯道“点传师”杨玉庆，在石景山锅炉车间当领班时，利用“下神”、“扶乩”办法，有系统地编制大批谣言（针对当时形势及我们宣传中心编造，自解放迄今他所编制的反动“乩语”及解说，已破获的有两包袱），破坏党和人民政府的威信。
  同错误的观点进行斗争
    当时领导干部长时期地存在着一些极其错误的观点：如片面的群众观点，认为“都是工人阶级，那里来的特务”！作保卫工作的同志提出建立一些必要的工人出入厂的手续，即被人批评为“脱离群众”；也有人存在着单纯的技术观点，对于职工中特别是对旧的技术人员中的复杂状况不敢进行审查，怕“人家不干了”，怕惹出事，怕失掉了技术上的依靠。这种无原则迁就落后的思想，给反革命分子活动造成极大的空隙。当时有的同志见事不妙，曾经提醒领导上注意特务活动，却被讥为“庸人自扰”。
    该厂六号发电机被破坏后，军代表及厂长均受到撤职的处分，但由于没有发动群众清除反革命分子，该厂政治上的严重情况仍然继续存在。修复六号机中又发现机器内回转子被塞进木头的破坏活动，这时上级党委开始警觉到石景山发电厂一再被破坏的事实，要求工厂认真检查。干部及职工积极分子中也提出清洗反革命分子的要求，但在领导干部中（包括当时的厂长）仍然犹豫不决。这些同志不是正面反对清除坏人，而是被困难吓倒，对上级指示和群众要求表现出一种无可奈何的神气。他们说：“不调出这些人，叫做政治冒险，不行。调出这些人，是技术冒险，也不行。”这也不行，那也不行，下不了决心。但是大多数干部、党员在这个问题上的看法同上级党委是一致的，他们号召群众保卫工厂，反对破坏，抓住一切反革命分子的破坏事实，向群众讲，利用一切集会进行宣传，提高群众的政治积极性和对敌人的警惕性。
    一九五○年三月间，上级党委坚决批驳了石景山发电厂某些干部，那种“政治冒险，技术冒险”的看法，指示他们毫不动摇地清洗坏人。石景山党组织遵照上级指示依靠党员和进步群众，从政治上整理了工人阶级的队伍。这次共清洗了八十三名，其中大部分是反革命分子（“国民党区分部委员”以下二十三名、“清共先锋队员”十二名、一贯道首六名、其余为蒋匪军官、流氓等）。后在职工要求下又连续清洗了一些，前后共被清洗一百三十四名。
  清洗坏分子转入民主改革
    石景山发电厂清除了这样一大批破坏分子，是领导上一个伟大的决心，是石景山发电厂走上民主改革道路的一个决定性的关键，是党放手依靠工人的试金石。人们眼睛亮了。党员和积极分子以及广大群众扬眉吐气了。被清洗了的坏分子离开该厂集合时，工人们在后边说：“喂！看见了吗？柳条串泥鳅，都是一色货呀！”工人中间对于革命与反革命开始有了鲜明的界限。工人晁伯玉说：“石景山是一九四八年解放的，我是一九五○年解放的！”他们并且打一个比喻说：“我们的工厂，好比一个人，从这个人身上挖去了这些坏肉，这个人就健康了！”
    这是石景山脱骨换胎的大事情。工人们至今谈起来还念念不忘，认为是对自己、对石景山生产事业的一大解放。确实如此，该厂运输场，刘大全（参加过国民党，解放后仍欺压工人）当领班的时候，各种工作都贯彻不下去。工会进行选举，他强制运输场工人都选他。在他的阻挠下，该场学习搞不起来。当六号机遭受破坏，该场工人进行讨论的时候，他首先说：“我保险，我们厂子里没有一个特务”，使大家不敢发言。当时运输场是该场人最多的一个场，但该厂领导上从这里调不出一个人来。自从刘大全被清洗出厂后，运输厂的工作效率在短时期内即提高了一倍，接着由于该场全体工人的努力，装修起桥型运煤机，工作效率较前提高了六倍。
    干部中的笼统的工人阶级观念也扭转过来了。他们从事实中认识到，必须清除潜伏在工人阶级中的反革命分子，才可以形成一个可以依靠的工人阶级的队伍。清除反革命分子后，石景山的工人、党员开始以主人翁资格要求改选工会，成立工厂管理委员会参加企业管理。工人普遍组织起安全小组，进行了劳动纪律的教育。群众的积极性一经发挥，立即涌现出一批新的技术力量，足以掌握生产主要部门。原有技术人员中，进步的更加积极，中间的已能够明辨是非，落后的也开始向进步靠拢。这些事实粉碎了技术冒险的错误思想。技术开始真正为人民生产事业服务。石景山发电厂的一切工作由被动转入主动。由领导上的裸体跳舞卷入热烈的群众生产和民主改革运动。
  明确的结论
    从去年三月到现在正好是一年。一年来，石景山发电厂的实际工作，给曾经存在过的一段敢不敢清除坏分子的历史争论作了明确的结论。
    石景山发电厂清洗坏分子的工作是成功的。从现在来看，却也不无缺点。主要的问题是在实行坚决清洗之后，工厂领导上没有很好结合工人切身利益开展对反革命分子的控诉，从思想上进行系统的教育工作。这一缺陷后来在抗美援朝与镇压反革命的运动中才得到补足。对于已清洗过的人，司法机关没有很好地发动石景山工人来参加处理，特别对其中罪大恶极的分子也没有尊重石景山发电厂工人意见严加惩处，甚至有的竟被分配了工作。一个反革命分子在石景山发电厂被清除后，经过管制又被派到大同发电厂工作，结果破坏了该厂的机器。这是一个血的教训，石景山的职工同志提起这件事对政府还是有意见，认为这是一个不应有的损失。
