　　Glorious Record
    — The Heroic Deeds of Wang Yougen, Representative of the Returning Volunteers
    Liu Ming
    The Chinese People's Volunteers, with their unparalleled courage and wisdom, implemented the policy of annihilating enemy manpower, repeatedly achieving battle results with enemy-to-own casualties ratios of dozens to one, inflicting huge losses in manpower and equipment on the American and British invading forces and the Li Chengwan bandit army. The deeds of combat hero Wang Yougen, a recently invited returning representative of the Volunteers, are the most obvious example. In one annihilation battle, he created a glorious record with an enemy-to-own casualties ratio of thirty-eight to one.

    Wang Yougen was the deputy battalion commander of a certain unit of the Volunteers, an outstanding commander adept at annihilating the enemy in mobile warfare. During the New Year offensive, which delivered the third blow to the enemy, he personally led a company, penetrating thirty miles into the enemy's heart, and annihilated more than 600 soldiers of the Li puppet army in one fell swoop, equivalent to four companies of troops. In the battle, he also captured twelve howitzers, nine recoilless guns, forty-one vehicles, three heavy machine guns, three anti-aircraft machine guns, and more than four hundred automatic rifles and carbines. Hero Wang Yougen was awarded a first-class merit for his courageous and resourceful command, and the company was also awarded a special-class merit.

    When the Chinese and Korean People's Armies broke through the enemy's "38th parallel" defense line on New Year's Eve, the Li puppet army, bearing the brunt of the attack, fled in disarray. Wang Yougen was ordered to take a company from Caoxiedong to Huayueli to annihilate the enemy at the opportune moment. At that time, there were still remnants of the enemy entrenched on the western hillside. Wang Yougen and his soldiers advanced to Hongqiling, two miles away from Caoxiedong, and encountered a few scattered enemies. The vanguard rushed up and captured three prisoners. Then they discovered an enemy guard platoon in Hongqili and captured eight more prisoners. According to the prisoners, there were more than a thousand soldiers from the 31st and 36th Regiments of the Li puppet army nearby, preparing to escape in the morning. Wang Yougen, looking down from Hongqiling, saw dozens of piles of bonfires where the enemy was warming themselves, indicating that the enemy was very complacent.

    It was 1:30 AM on January 2nd. After assessing the situation, Wang Yougen resolutely ordered to put down all non-combat equipment and resolutely pursue and annihilate the enemy!

    The troops chased to Huayueli but did not see any trace of the enemy, but they could still faintly hear the sound of car engines. Wang Yougen shone a flashlight and saw that the wheel tracks on the road were all heading south. He immediately ordered: "Continue to advance until you catch up with the cars." The warriors ran and chased for more than a mile, and rushed to the north of Shangnanzong before catching the tail of the enemy. Wang Yougen ordered the use of small cannons to fire at the front row. The enemy's cars in the rear frantically collided and overturned into the ditch. The warriors let go of the cars and chased for another mile. The rearguard enemy hurriedly stopped and just set up three heavy machine guns. Before they had time to load the bullets, the Volunteers, carrying automatic rifles and light machine guns, had already rushed to them, killed the enemy gunners, seized the three heavy machine guns, and annihilated this group of enemies. Wang Yougen saw that there were no howitzers and not many cars, so he continued to order: "Catch up with the howitzers!"

    The warriors chased for another mile. It was 4:30 AM. In three hours, Wang Yougen's warriors drove straight into the enemy's depth of twenty miles from Hongqili to the enemy's depth in Shangnanzong. In Shangnanzong, Wang Yougen's warriors not only caught up with the enemy's howitzer company, but also captured a battalion each from the 31st and 36th Regiments of the Li puppet army. The Volunteers, who descended like gods, took advantage of a burst of firepower to surge into the enemy ranks and seize favorable positions. The enemy never expected such a thing to happen thirty miles behind their lines. Many enemies were killed before they had time to get out of the cars. The bewildered remnants surrendered under the threat of the soldiers' firepower. In this battle, 376 enemies were captured, exceeding 50% of the number of enemies killed or wounded.

    The situation of annihilating a large number of enemy personnel at the cost of a small number of troops and very little cost is the same for the American and British invading forces. On February 12th, hero Wang Yougen completely annihilated an American howitzer battalion with only two infantry companies in the battle in the Hengcheng area. Wang Yougen's soldiers, who were good at fighting alone, called this kind of battle "blooming in the enemy's chest"!

    At 10:00 PM on February 12th, Wang Yougen's warriors seized eighteen howitzers and more than one hundred vehicles of the US 2nd Division's howitzer battalion, which was fleeing south in embarrassment, near Caotanggou, about fifteen miles north of Hengcheng. In the dark night, on a road full of potholes, the speed of the American motorized troops was not much faster than the two legs of Wang Yougen's warriors. Sure enough, one of the enemy's car group was hit by a chasing shell and caught fire, and the leading car was also blocked by another wrecked car lying across the road. Just as the enemy jumped out of the cars in a chaotic manner, preparing to turn around and resist, Wang Yougen had already directed the 3rd Company to detour to the enemy's flanks from the side of the right wing mountain, occupying a small high ground by the road; the 1st Company, following closely, deployed its firepower on the front and searched forward vehicle by vehicle, forming a pincer attack, suppressing the enemy on the narrow strip of the road. At this time, the 3rd Company soldiers cleverly used grenades to set a car burning by the side of the highway bridge, and the blazing fire completely exposed the enemy in front of them. The American soldiers, crowded on the river bank and stubbornly resisting, were killed and wounded by a fierce barrage of fire from the warriors, with more than 200 casualties. The enemy used two tanks to drive off the road to help the battle. Our soldiers cleverly concealed themselves, aimed and fired at the enemy's infantry, and used a small amount of firepower to attract the tanks to fire blindly. Finally, the enemy tank gunners ran out of ammunition and just climbed out of the turret to escape, they were immediately shot dead by the soldiers.

    In the four-hour fierce battle, Wang Yougen's warriors killed more than 300 American soldiers, and friendly neighboring troops cooperated to capture more than 100 enemy stragglers. All the tanks, howitzers, and vehicles were seized.

    There are more and more examples of annihilating a large number of enemies with small casualties on the front line. This is the result of the correct implementation of the strategic policy of annihilating enemy manpower by the Chinese and Korean People's Armies. This operational policy will cause the American invading forces, which have already lost a large amount of manpower and equipment in the war, to lose more bets. As time goes on, the American invaders will only end in a shameful defeat.

　　光辉的纪录       
    ——志愿军归国代表王有根的英雄事迹
    刘鸣
    中国人民志愿军以其无比的英勇与智慧，执行了歼灭敌人有生力量的方针，屡创敌我伤亡数十比一的战例，予美英侵略军及李承晚匪军人力、装备以巨大损失。新近应邀归国的志愿军代表战斗英雄王有根的事迹，是最明显的例证。他在一次歼灭战中创造了敌我伤亡三十八与一之比的光辉纪录。
    王有根是志愿军某营副营长，善于在运动中歼灭敌人的出色指挥员。在给敌人第三次打击的新年攻势中，他亲自带领一个连，直插敌人纵深三十里的心脏中，一鼓歼灭李伪军六百余人，相等于四个连的兵力。战斗中并缴获了榴弹炮十二门，无后座力炮九门，汽车四十一辆，重机枪三挺，高射机枪三挺，自动步枪、卡宾枪四百余支。英雄王有根因指挥勇敢、机智，立一大功，该连也记特等功一次。
    当除夕中朝人民大军突破敌“三八”线防线后，首当其冲的李伪军望风溃逃。王有根奉命带着一连从草鞋洞插到华岳里相机歼灭敌人。当时西边山头上还有残敌盘踞。王有根与他的战士们挺进到离草鞋洞二里的红旗岭，遇上了几个零星敌人。前锋部队扑上去抓了三个俘虏。接着他们在红旗里发现敌人一个警戒排，又抓了八个俘虏。据俘虏说，附近有李伪军三一、三六两个联队的一千多人，准备在早晨撤逃。王有根在红旗岭上望到下面有好几十堆敌人在烤火的火光，可以看出敌人是很麻痹的。
    这时是一月二日晨一点半，王有根经过判断情况后，果敢地下令放下一切非战斗用具，坚决追歼敌人！
    部队追到华岳里也没有见到敌人的影子，但还能隐约地听见汽车的马达声。王有根用手电筒照了一下，见到大道上的车轮印子都朝南去了。他立即下令：“继续前进，直到追上汽车为止。”勇士们跑步猛追了一里多路，飞奔到上南淙以北，才把敌人的尾巴抓住了。王有根命令用小炮向前排击。敌人在后尾的汽车慌张地碰撞着翻到沟里。勇士们放过汽车又追了一里多路。殿后的敌人慌忙停下来，刚架好三挺重机枪，还没有来得及装上子弹，端着自动步枪、轻机枪跑步冲锋的志愿军勇士们已杀奔到跟前，打死了敌人的射手，夺下了三挺重机枪，消灭了这一股敌人。王有根一看没有榴弹炮，汽车也不多，就继续命令：“追上榴弹炮！”
    勇士们又追下一里多路。这时是四点半，勇士们在三小时内从红旗里到上南淙的敌人纵深阵地内长驱直入二十里。在上南淙，王有根的勇士们不仅追上了敌人的榴弹炮连，李伪军三一、三六两个联队的各一个营也都被抓住了。神兵天降的志愿军勇士们声势汹涌地趁着一阵火力直插入敌群，抢占了有利阵地。敌人再也想不到在纵深三十里的后方会发生这样的事情。很多敌人还没有来得及跨下汽车就被打死。不知所措的残敌在战士们的火力威胁下纷纷缴枪投降。这次战斗中俘敌三百七十六名，超过了毙伤敌人数字的百分之五十。
    以少数兵力、很小的代价，大量歼灭敌人有生力量的情形，对于美、英侵略军来说也是一样。二月十二日，英雄王有根在横城地区作战中仅以两个步兵连即全歼美军一个榴弹炮营。勇于孤胆作战的王有根的战士们把这种战斗称做“在敌人胸膛中开花”！
    二月十二日晚十时，王有根的勇士们在横城以北约十五里的草塘沟附近，一把抓住正在狼狈南窜的美军第二师榴弹炮营的十八门榴弹炮与一百多辆汽车。在黑夜里，在弹坑遍地的公路上，美国摩托化部队的行动速率并不比王有根的勇士们的两条腿快多少。果然，敌人汽车群中有一辆被追击的炮弹打中起火了，最前面的汽车也被横在公路上的另一辆被打毁的汽车挡住了。正当敌人乱哄哄地跳下车来准备转身抵抗时，王有根早已指挥三连从右翼山根边迂回到敌人侧后，占领了公路边的一块小高地；跟踵而上的一连就在正面展开火力逐车搜索前进，形成钳形合击，把敌人压制在公路的狭长地带上。这时，三连战士机智地用手榴弹把公路桥边的一辆汽车打得燃烧起来，火光熊熊地使敌人完全暴露在他们眼前。拥挤地爬在河沿上顽抗的美国兵被勇士们一阵炽烈的火力杀伤二百多人。敌人用两辆坦克开下公路助战。我们的战士们巧妙地隐伏着瞄准射击敌人的步兵；并用少部分火力吸引坦克盲目地发射。最后敌人坦克手打光了弹药刚爬出炮塔想逃命，立即被战士们打死。
    四小时的激战中王有根的勇士们击毙美军三百多人，友邻部队配合俘敌散兵一百余人，坦克、榴弹炮、汽车全部缴获。
    前线上这种以小的伤亡大量歼灭敌人的范例愈来愈多，它是中朝人民军队正确执行歼灭敌人有生力量的战略方针的结果。这一作战方针将使已经在战争中损失了大量有生力量与装备的美国侵略军失去更多的赌注。随着时间的推移，美国侵略者就只能以可耻的失败而告终。
