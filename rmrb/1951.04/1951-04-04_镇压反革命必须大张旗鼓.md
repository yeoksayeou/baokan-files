　　The suppression of counter-revolutionaries must be done with great fanfare.
　　On March 27, 1951, the Third Tianjin Municipal People's Consultative Conference held its Fourth Enlarged Meeting. The members unanimously advocated that counter-revolutionaries should be severely suppressed, and resolved to convene a Tianjin Municipal and District People's Representative Enlarged Meeting to discuss the issue of punishing counter-revolutionary criminals. When the meeting was held at Minyuan Square on March 29, 1951, 15,000 representatives from all walks of life attended and listened to Xu Jianguo, Director of the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau, give a report on Tianjin's severe suppression of counter-revolutionary activities. The entire audience shouted slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao" and "Support the Correct Leadership of the People's Government." Many citizens who had suffered from the devastation and persecution of special agents, local bullies, and counter-revolutionaries went on stage to denounce the heinous crimes of these counter-revolutionaries. Among them, Liu Liu, an elderly woman from Dongsuntai, Dazhigu, Fifth District of Tianjin, fainted while speaking due to excessive grief and indignation when denouncing the crimes of local bully Jing Yijiang (Jing San). Despite the best efforts of doctors, she unfortunately died due to a ruptured cerebral blood vessel. The people of Tianjin unanimously demanded severe punishment for the heinous counter-revolutionaries to avenge the deceased.
　　The Military Law Department of the Tianjin Military Control Commission accepted the accusations and demands of the people from all walks of life and, in accordance with the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, executed a group of counter-revolutionary criminals on March 31. The broad masses of Tianjin citizens cheered "Wonderful!" everywhere, and many people came from far away to see the fate of these local bullies and special agents.
　　The Sixth, Ninth, and Eleventh Districts of Tianjin, the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Workers, more than 6,000 employees of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, and employees of the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory all held meetings to denounce the crimes of counter-revolutionaries and unanimously supported the people's government's resolute measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries.
