Xinhua News Agency, Luzhou, April 24th: The Public Security Department of the Yibin Administrative Commissioner's Office in Southern Sichuan District, responding to the demands of the local people, has arrested French imperialist spy Lin Maode, who used Catholicism for counter-revolutionary activities.

Lin arrived in China in 1928. In 1946, after being transferred to the position of Bishop of the Yibin Diocese of the Catholic Church, the criminal frequently used "visits" as a pretext to go to the areas inhabited by Han and Yi ethnic groups in Leibo, Mabian, Pingshan, and Ebian counties in southern Sichuan to gather intelligence on mineral deposits and border affairs, which was supplied to the French consulates in Chongqing and Chengdu at the time. In 1949, the criminal also presided over the publication of the reactionary magazine "Our Voice," openly spreading absurd anti-communist and anti-Soviet fallacies. Before the liberation of Yibin County, French priests Li Maolin and Meng Derong, and other spy elements from the diocese, before fleeing to Hong Kong, handed over to Lin one American-style military eight-tube transceiver, one military telephone, and one generator. After the liberation of Yibin, Lin, disregarding our government's laws and decrees, refused to submit the batch of telecommunications equipment and the Browning pistol and four other guns he brought from France, and continued to collude with Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents. In July of last year, the criminal harbored Kuomintang military intelligence agent Yang Zhengyu and Zeng Daming, the battalion commander of the bandit "Southern Sichuan Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," and other counter-revolutionary criminals with blood debts (these two criminals have been arrested by the People's Government and executed after trial), and harbored a large amount of stolen goods from counter-revolutionary criminal Qin Xiaolou (who has been executed).

As early as October of last year, when Yibin Catholics were preparing for the reform movement, Lin threatened the Catholics with "apostasy" to undermine the reform movement.

Lin's consistent crimes of endangering the Chinese people have aroused the anger of people from all walks of life in Yibin County. According to the people's demands, the Public Security Department of the Yibin Prefecture arrested him on the tenth of last month in accordance with the law, and confiscated his radio station and weapons. The Yibin Catholic Church Self-Reliance Reform Committee and more than 10,000 urban residents have successively issued statements, unanimously demanding that the People's Government severely punish Lin.

　　川南区宜宾专署接受人民要求
　  逮捕法国间谍林茂德
　  该犯利用天主教进行反革命活动
    【新华社泸州二十四日电】川南区宜宾行政专员公署公安处，接受当地人民要求，已将利用天主教进行反革命活动的法帝国主义间谍分子林茂德逮捕。
    林犯于一九二八年来华。一九四六年，该犯调任天主教宜宾教区主教以后，经常以“参观”为名，到川南雷波、马边、屏山、峨边等县的汉、彝各民族杂居地区，刺探矿藏及边务情况，供给当时在重庆和成都的法国领事馆。一九四九年，该犯并主持出版反动刊物《我们的呼声》，公开散布反共反苏的荒谬言论。宜宾县解放前夕，该教区法籍神甫李茂林、孟德荣等间谍分子逃往香港前，曾将美式军用八灯收发报机、军用电话机及发电机各一部，移交给林犯。宜宾解放后，林犯竟蔑视我政府法令，拒绝呈缴该批电讯器材及其自法国带来的白朗林手枪和其他四支枪支，并仍与蒋匪特务勾结往来。去年七月，该犯先后曾窝藏国民党军统特务杨正煜和匪“川南反共救国军”营长曾达明等血债累累的反革命罪犯（该两犯已经人民政府逮捕，并于审讯后执行枪决），并窝藏反革命罪犯覃筱楼（已经处决）的大批赃物。
    早在去年十月，宜宾天主教徒酝酿革新运动时，林犯即以“叛教”来威吓教徒，破坏革新运动。
    林犯一贯危害中国人民的各种罪行，激起了宜宾县各界人民的愤怒。宜宾专署公安处根据人民要求，依法于上月十日将其逮捕，并没收其电台和武器。宜宾天主教自立革新委员会和城区居民一万多人，曾先后联名发表声明，一致要求人民政府严惩林犯。
