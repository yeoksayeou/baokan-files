　　Do Not Ignore the Power of the People When Exposing Enemy Crimes
　　Ye Ping
    Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, we have seen many vivid and moving art works and news photographs. They vividly demonstrate the power of the people, expose the crimes of the enemy; deepen the people's hatred for the enemy, and inspire the people's determination to resist America and aid Korea. In the current propaganda campaign against the American arming of Japan and the severe suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the pens of our artists and the lenses of our photographers are once again aimed at this group of enemies at home and abroad, digging up all their old and new crimes, further strengthening the people's practical actions to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country. These art works and news photographs are very necessary for the Chinese people who have struggled out of long days of suffering. It can promote further awakening and unity among the people of the whole country, and will generate the power of encouragement and education for safeguarding their free and happy lives today and for the great cause of safeguarding world peace.
    However, there are also a few bad art works and photos that have appeared. Not only did they fail to achieve the desired propaganda effect, but they also insulted the strong and unyielding character of the Chinese people. For example, the two photos of Japanese invaders raping Chinese women published in the 83rd issue of "Northeast Pictorial" are very bad. These photos were originally taken by the Japanese invaders to insult the Chinese people, but today our pictorial editors published them again in their original form without any selection, which is obviously wrong. Another example is the cartoon "Mercy towards Counter-Revolutionary Elements is Cruelty towards the People" published in the April 7th "People's Daily", which depicts our revolutionary cadres as so fragile and panicked in front of special agents, boosting the enemy's morale and diminishing our own ambition, which is a distortion of our revolutionary cadres. There are also a few works that expose the crimes of the Japanese invaders in China, but have failed to grasp the correct method of expression. Some, for the sake of compositional changes, have a woman's undershirt hanging from the bayonet of a Japanese soldier, which is a very unserious way of painting.
    It is wrong to only one-sidedly emphasize the enemy's rape, looting, and killing, while neglecting the people's will to resist. We know that the more cruel the enemy is, the stronger the Chinese people's resistance will be. The Chinese people overthrew Japanese imperialism in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, and then defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries in the three-year War of Liberation, while driving out the American imperialist aggressors. The Chinese people have never bowed their heads to any enemy. What reason do we have to use such news photos and such art works to insult ourselves? We hope that our authors and editors will pay attention to the educational role of art, and not only pay attention to the truth of the facts, but also pay attention to the truth of artistic expression. When exposing the enemy's crimes, do not ignore the great power of the people and the inevitability of our victory.

### 暴露敌人罪行时不要无视人民的力量

　　暴露敌人罪行时不要无视人民的力量
　　野苹
    自从抗美援朝运动开展以来，我们看到了很多生动感人的美术作品和新闻照片。它们形象地表现了人民的力量，暴露了敌人的罪行；加深了人民对敌人的仇恨，鼓舞了人民抗美援朝的决心。在目前反对美国武装日本和严厉镇压反革命的宣传活动中，我们的美术工作者的笔尖和摄影工作者的镜头又对准了这批国内外的敌人，把他们的新旧罪行一齐翻出，更加强了人民抗美援朝保家卫国的实际行动。这些美术作品和新闻照片，对于从长期苦难的日子里奋斗出来的中国人民，是非常需要的。它能促使全国人民进一步的觉醒和团结，对于保卫自己今天的自由幸福生活，保卫世界和平的伟大事业，将产生鼓动和教育的力量。
    但是，其中也有少数不好的美术作品和照片出现。它不但没有达到应有的宣传效果，反而侮辱了中国人民坚强不屈的性格。例如“东北画报”第八十三期上发表的两幅日寇强奸中国妇女的照片就很不好，这两幅照片原是日寇摄来用以侮辱中国人民的，今天我们的画报编者却毫无选择地又原样发表，这显然是错误的。再如四月七日《人民日报》发表的“对于反革命分子的仁慈就是对于人民的残忍”的漫画，把我们的革命干部在特务面前描写成那样脆弱和惊慌失措的样子，长敌人的威风、灭自己的志气，这是对我们革命干部的一种歪曲。还有少数暴露日寇在华罪行的作品，也未能掌握正确的表现方法。有的为了构图的变化，在日寇的刺刀上挑着一件女人的衬裤，这都是很不严肃的画法。
    只是片面强调敌人的奸淫烧杀，而忽略人民反抗的意志是不对的。我们知道，敌人越是残忍，中国人民反抗的情绪越是强烈。中国人民在八年抗日战争中打倒了日本帝国主义，在三年的解放战争中又打垮了国民党反动派，同时赶走了美帝国主义侵略者。中国人民从来没有向任何敌人低过头。我们有什么理由用那样的新闻照片和那样的美术作品来侮辱自己呢？希望我们的作者和编者，要重视艺术的教育作用，不但要注意事实情况的真实，而且要注意艺术表现的真实。在暴露敌人的罪行时，更不要无视人民的强大力量，和我们的胜利的必然性。
