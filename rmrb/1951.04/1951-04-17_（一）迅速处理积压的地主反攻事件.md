　　(I) Swiftly Handle Backlogged Landlord Counter-Offensive Incidents

　　According to a report from the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, since August of last year, there have been over a thousand incidents of unlawful landlords launching counter-offensives against peasants in the province's rural areas. Some of these incidents have not been dealt with to this day, while others are only now beginning to be addressed. Furthermore, according to a report from the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee in Hebei Province on March 10th: incomplete statistics show that in the prefecture's fourteen counties, there have been 698 incidents of landlords and rich peasants launching counter-offensives (in 345 villages). 357 of these incidents have been dealt with, and the land and property seized have been recovered. However, many counties still adopt an indifferent attitude towards these major political events in the countryside, and have not yet dealt with them promptly and thoroughly. Much of the land and property seized from the peasants by the landlords remains in the hands of the landlords. For example, in Huolu, out of 80 incidents of unlawful landlord counter-offensives, only about 20 have been dealt with so far; in Pingshan, out of 101 incidents, only 11 major cases have been dealt with; in Gaocheng, out of 117 incidents, only 49 have been dealt with. In total, there are still over 300 cases in the prefecture that have not been dealt with. The main reason why these serious problems have not been resolved in a timely manner is that the relevant leading cadres suffer from severe political paralysis and bureaucratic work styles. They have not taken resolute measures to crack down on the counter-offensive crimes of unlawful landlords, suppress the most heinous elements, and support the peasants. They have not stood on the position that the people's government should have, and supported the peasants' just struggle against unlawful landlords. The existence of these serious phenomena is now bound to affect the peasants' enthusiasm for spring plowing and production. Therefore, the relevant regions should immediately correct these errors, seriously and effectively handle all incidents related to unlawful landlord counter-offensives, vigorously support the peasants, and punish the bad elements according to law. When handling these incidents, attention should be paid at all times to combating the right-leaning paralysis of some cadres. Higher leading organs should conduct a thorough investigation and resolution of this issue in conjunction with the spring plowing inspection work. In areas where unlawful landlord counter-offensive incidents have already been discovered, the higher-level organs in that area should instruct the lower levels to immediately report the handling situation and provide instructions and assistance.

　　（一）迅速处理积压的地主反攻事件
    据山西省委报告，从去年八月以来，该省农村不法地主向农民反攻事件已达千余件，其中有些至今尚未处理，有些正开始处理。另据河北省石家庄地委三月十日报告：该区不完全统计，全区十四个县发生地主富农反攻事件六百九十八件（三百四十五个村），已处理了三百五十七件，追回了被夺土地财产。但仍有不少县对这些农村重大政治事件采取漠然视之的态度，至今尚未及时彻底处理，被地主从农民手中夺回之土地财产有不少至今还在地主手中，如获鹿发生的八十起不法地主反攻事件，现在才处理了二十多件；平山发生了一百零一件，才处理了主要案件十一件；藁城发生了一百一十七件，才处理了四十九件。总计全区尚有三百多件未处理。这些严重问题未能及时解决，主要是因为有关的领导干部存在着严重的政治麻痹现象和官僚主义的作风。他们没有采取坚决手段来打击不法地主的反攻罪行，镇压其中罪大恶极分子，为农民撑腰，没有站在人民政府应有立场上，支持农民对不法地主进行正义的斗争。这些严重现象的存在，现在势必要影响农民春耕生产情绪。因此，有关地区应当马上纠正这些错误，认真有效地处理一切有关不法地主反攻的事件，大力支持农民，依法惩办坏分子。在处理时，要随时随地注意同某些干部的右倾麻痹思想进行斗争。高级领导机关应结合春耕检查工作对此进行彻底处理，凡是已经发现有不法地主反攻事件的地区，该地上级机关应责成下级立即报告处理情况并给予指示和帮助。
