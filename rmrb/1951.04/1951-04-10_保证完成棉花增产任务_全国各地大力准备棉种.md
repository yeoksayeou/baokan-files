Guarantee the Completion of Cotton Production Increase Task
Cotton Seeds Vigorously Prepared in All Parts of the Country

　　To ensure the successful completion of this year's cotton planting task, various regions are vigorously preparing cotton seeds. In 1950, most parts of the country saw a bumper harvest of cotton, and the maturity of the seeds was generally good. During the autumn harvest, many regions also carried out seed selection work. Therefore, except for individual disaster areas and newly expanded cotton areas, most cotton-producing regions have no problems with cotton seeds this year. Regarding improved varieties, the task of purchasing 1,020,000 dan of improved seeds nationwide has been nearly completed due to the implementation of the policy of purchasing and preserving seeds in improved seed management areas last year, and the quality of the seeds has been greatly improved compared with last year. The following is a report on the cotton seed preparation situation in various regions:

　　The Northeast region is preparing to promote the Guannong No. 1 cotton seed on a large scale this year, gradually eliminating the Jidong cotton seed and the Jinzi cotton seed. Last year, the Northeast produced 1,200,000 dan of Guannong No. 1 cotton seeds, but due to the early frost last year (most areas were more than 20 days earlier than in 1949), drought after waterlogging, and the occurrence of pests and diseases, the maturity of the cotton seeds was poor. In order to expand the cotton planting area in 1951, the People's Government made every effort to carry out seed purchase, adjustment, and loan work. To improve the germination rate, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northeast People's Government has issued instructions calling for the widespread organization of the masses to carry out seed selection work.

　　The North China region can solve the cotton seed needed for expanding the cotton field area this year. However, the masses generally demand to replace improved varieties. Last year, the masses in Hebei Province selected and retained 81,300 dan of improved varieties. The local improved seed ginning mills have mastered 165,000 dan of Si Zi cotton 2B and No. 4 cotton seeds, and it is expected that the area for promoting and breeding improved varieties can be expanded to 2.4 million mu, an increase of two times compared with last year (the area for breeding improved varieties was 800,000 mu last year). In addition, the excellent cotton seeds mastered by Shanxi and Pingyuan are also sufficient to complete this year's promotion and breeding tasks.

　　The excellent cotton seeds in Shaanxi, Northwest, have been roughly popularized throughout the province. Last year, the masses in cotton areas selected 104,319 dan of seeds, which can be sown on more than 1 million mu. In addition, the province has also mastered 12,709 dan of four varieties including Si Zi cotton No. 4, No. 517, Jing Si cotton, and De Zi cotton, and is still continuing to purchase, which may reach 20,000 dan. In northern Xinjiang Province, 800 dan of Schneider seeds are promoted locally, and another 2,000 dan of high-yielding No. 8517 cotton seeds are introduced from the Soviet Union, ready to be promoted and bred in southern Xinjiang.

　　East China region has purchased a total of about 193,100 dan of improved varieties. Shandong Province recovered 34,000 dan of loaned seeds and purchased 88,500 dan. In addition to local promotion, more than 1,000 dan of Si Zi cotton Wuai No. 1 was transferred to Dezhou Prefecture in December last year for breeding and promotion. Due to the floods in northern Anhui last year, cotton seeds are lacking. In addition to the 8,000 dan of cotton seeds mastered locally, 3,200 dan of De Zi cotton were transferred from the East China region.

　　In the Central South region, Henan Province has concentrated 33,000 dan of improved varieties, which can be promoted on more than 300,000 mu, and transferred 500 dan of Jing Si cotton from Shaanxi for breeding and promotion in western Henan. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Hunan Provincial People's Government has concentrated 2,341 dan of improved varieties such as De Zi cotton for breeding in Nanhua County, and transferred 1,000 dan of Dai Zi cotton from East China for breeding in Binhu. General cotton seeds are solved by the special county governments themselves. Pengze and Yongxiu ginning mills in Jiangxi Province have collected more than 4,000 dan of improved varieties, and transferred 6,290 dan of Dai Zi cotton No. 15 improved varieties from Subei, East China, for breeding in Pengze, Hukou, Yongxiu and other places.

　　In order to solve the problem of clothing difficulties for the masses in areas with closed traffic, the Southwest Military and Political Committee issued instructions to vigorously develop cotton planting, but there is a large shortage of cotton seeds. In southern Sichuan, cotton had a bumper harvest in 1950, and there was a surplus of seeds. The areas lacking seeds are mainly eastern Sichuan and western Sichuan. In addition to transferring a part from southern Sichuan and strictly prohibiting the use of improved varieties for oil extraction, the government is vigorously carrying out purchases to solve the problem of insufficient cotton seeds.

　　Now that the cotton planting season is approaching, all regions should distribute the cotton seeds to the farmers as soon as possible, and universally mobilize the masses to carry out seed selection. At the same time, cotton processing departments in various regions should gin the cotton seeds for seed use as soon as possible, and pay attention to doing germination tests. As for the seeds transferred from neighboring areas to some seed-deficient areas, the transfer work should be carefully planned to avoid losses.

### 保证完成棉花增产任务  全国各地大力准备棉种

　　保证完成棉花增产任务
　  全国各地大力准备棉种
    为保证今年植棉任务胜利完成，各地正大力准备棉种。一九五○年全国棉花大部丰收，种籽的成熟程度一般都好。秋收时，不少地区又进行了选种工作，因此，今年除个别灾区及新扩大棉区外，大部产棉地区的棉种均已不成问题。关于良种方面，由于去年在良种管理区执行了收购保种的政策，全国收购一○二万担良种的任务已近完成，种籽质量较去年大大提高。现将各地棉种准备情况报道如下：
    东北区今年准备大量推广关农一号棉种，逐渐淘汰冀东棉种和金字棉种。去年东北产关农一号棉籽一二○万担，但因去年初霜太早（大部地区均较一九四九年提早二十天以上），先潦后旱，以及发生病虫害等原因，棉籽的成熟程度较差，为扩大一九五一年植棉面积，人民政府曾尽力进行种籽收购调剂及贷放工作，为提高发芽率，东北人民政府农林部已发布指示，号召普遍组织群众进行粒选工作。
    华北区今年扩大棉田面积所需棉种，各地都可解决。但群众普遍要求更换良种。河北省去年群众选种自留的良种八一、三○○担，各地良种轧花厂掌握了斯字棉二Ｂ和四号棉种一六五、○○○担，预定可扩大良种推广繁殖面积到二四○万亩，较去年增加两倍（去年良种繁殖面积为八十万亩）此外山西、平原掌握的优良棉种，也足够完成今年推广繁殖任务。
    西北陕西的优良棉种，已大致普及全省。去年棉区群众选种一○四、三一九担，可播种一○○余万亩。此外，该省并已掌握斯字棉四号，五一七号，泾斯棉、德字棉等四品种一二、七○九担，现仍在继续收购，可能达到二万担。新疆省北部就地推广什奈尔种八○○担，另由苏联引进高产量的八五一七号棉种二、○○○担，准备在新疆南部推广繁殖。
    华东全区共收购良种约一九三、一○○担。山东省收回贷种三四、○○○担，收购八八、五○○担，除就地推广外，并已于去年十二月调到德县专区斯字棉五爱一、○○○余担，以做繁殖推广之用。皖北因去年遭受水灾，棉种缺乏，除本地掌握棉种八、○○○担外，由华东区调剂德字棉三、二○○担。
    中南区河南省已集中良种三万三千担，可推广三十余万亩，并从陕西调剂泾斯棉五百担，在豫西繁殖推广。湖南省人民政府农林厅，已集中德字棉等良种二千三百四十一担，在南华县繁殖，并由华东调剂岱字棉一千担在滨湖繁殖。一般棉种由各专县政府自行解决。江西省彭泽，永修两轧花厂已收良种四千余担，又从华东区苏北调剂岱字棉十五号良种六、二九○担，在彭泽、湖口、永修等地繁殖。
    为解决交通闭塞地区群众衣料困难，西南军政委员会发布了大力发展植棉的指示，但棉种缺乏较多。川南一九五○年棉花丰收，种籽有余。缺种地区主要为川东、川西，现除由川南调剂一部，并严禁用良种榨油外，政府正大力进行收购，以解决棉种不足问题。
    现在植棉季节即将到来，各地应及早将棉种发到农民手里，并普遍发动群众进行粒选。同时各地棉花加工部门应尽先轧出种用棉籽，并注意做发芽试验。至于部分缺种地区向旁区调运的种籽，则应周密计划调运工作，以免遭受损失。
