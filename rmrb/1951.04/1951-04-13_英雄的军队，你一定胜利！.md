　　Heroic Army, You Will Surely Triumph!
    Our Correspondent Lin Wei
    On February 8th this year, when the citizens of Seoul celebrated the third anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army, a young man named Kim Sun-ok wrote in his congratulatory message:
    "The three thousand miles of beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea,
    Have been burned into a wasteland by the American bandits:
    The wasteland is soaked with the blood and tears of our murdered compatriots,
    Under the soil are buried the corpses of our murdered compatriots...
    Great People's Army,
    Dear soldiers,
    The people concentrate all their gratitude on you,
    And entrust the future of the motherland to you.
    In the struggle against the American aggressors,
    The people support you with all their strength.
    You must triumph!
    You will surely triumph!"
    The People's Army must triumph, and will surely triumph. This is the heartfelt cry of the thirty million suffering people of Korea who have endured the trampling of imperialism, and it is also the heroic thought and firm will of all the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army. The People's Army has not disappointed the people's expectations, and will never disappoint the people's expectations.
  Growing Stronger in the Anti-Aggression Battles
    The war of American imperialism's aggression against Korea and the Korean people's resistance to aggression actually began in 1949. On July 25th of that year, the First Division of the Syngman Rhee puppet army, stationed in Kaesong, under the command of American military advisors and armed with American weapons, launched a sudden fierce attack and seized the Songaksan Heights north of the 38th parallel. Nearby villages and schools were bombed, and farmers, students, and teachers were massacred. The people who had just been given land were once again preparing to flee in tears. At this time, the People's Army, which had been established for less than a year and a half and was small in number, bravely stepped forward and fought bloody battles with the enemy on the slopes of Songaksan, repeatedly charging and killing more than a hundred bandits, finally driving the bandits back to their original positions. The news spread like wildfire, and all kinds of慰劳品 comfort items, countless flowers and flags, flowed from all corners to the People's Army and the homes of more than sixty martyrs. In the mountains and fields, the people recited with lofty respect and enthusiastic tears the heroic deeds of Yan Yixie, a great young martyr in the style of the Soviet "ordinary soldier": In the battle to recover the 488 Heights of Songaksan, he participated in four consecutive assaults, and finally threw himself fearlessly in front of the enemy's heavy machine gun, which was spewing flames, using his body to block the muzzle, allowing his comrades to charge up the heights and annihilate the enemy. In the hometown of Yan Yixie, Huanghae Province, the people held a solemn ceremony and presented the national flag medal awarded to the martyr by the state to the martyr's family.
    Following in the bloodstained footsteps of the martyrs, millions of Korean people embarked on the glorious road of anti-American struggle. The broad masses of farmers, workers, and intellectuals who had obtained land, stable jobs, and democratic rights after 1945, voluntarily signed up to join the army, and there were many cases of brothers, sisters, relatives, friends, and classmates joining the army together in various places. Many young men who used to run around everywhere to avoid military service during the Japanese rule now voluntarily came to sign up for the army. The People's Army rapidly grew and consolidated, becoming a powerful people's army. In the year before last June, the American aggressors instigated the puppet Syngman Rhee to launch hundreds of attacks on Songaksan, Yinbosan, Gesan, and Yongjin north of the 38th parallel, and each time they were defeated by this People's Army and retreated in a disheveled manner to the south of the 38th parallel.
  Accepting the People's Demands, Punishing the Arsonists
    The people's patience gradually reached the point where they could no longer endure it. They could not allow the disasters of war to develop endlessly. Many people wrote letters to the People's Army, expressing the same view: "If the enemy can attack us and slaughter us, why can't we pursue them and punish them?" The Yinboli Farmers' Association wrote to the People's Army saying, "As long as the troublemakers are eliminated, we will give the People's Army whatever they need! Otherwise, the fields cannot be cultivated and people cannot live... Even our oxen have been taken away and killed!"
    In late May, the representatives sent by the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front to South Korea to negotiate peace were captured and murdered by the American-Rhee bandits. On June 24th, the enemy issued a general attack order, and the long-prepared full-scale "northern expedition" began, and the Korean War broke out in full. However, the heroic People's Army did not allow the enemy to spread the flames of war to the entire Korean peninsula and even China as planned. The heavy hammer unexpectedly crushed the bandits across the board. In Yinbosan, Songaksan and other places, the bandits abandoned a large number of corpses during their retreat.
    Let those conscienceless enemies of mankind say that the People's Army "invaded" South Korea! With the will of the people as their will, the People's Army, after repelling the enemy's attack on the 25th, raised high the banner of extinguishing the flames of war and advanced south across the 38th parallel! They swore to the people and to General Kim Il-sung, determined to severely punish those murderers, bandits, and arsonists who would never voluntarily abandon their butcher knives!
    Cheers shook all the cities and villages, and letters encouraging the soldiers to fight bravely against the enemy flew in like snowflakes. A young wife in Lianchuan wrote a letter telling her husband: "The government helps us, the neighbors help us, and my child and I are doing well. As long as you can drive the enemy away, our family's situation will never get worse again." Elementary school students in Kimcheon wrote: "People's Army Uncles! Hurry up and drive away those demons, so we don't have to be hit by American cannons anymore (enemy artillery on the 38th parallel test-fires north every day, killing many people)! Our study plans can be completed!" The shouts of "Strive for the independence and unification of the motherland!" "Strive for peace and democracy!" "Down with American imperialism!" resounded throughout every corner of Korea.
  Advancing Bravely Regardless of Personal Safety
    The people's righteous indignation and aspirations motivated the People's Army soldiers. They were so selfless in battle! Many miracles in military history have occurred here. Li Dongkui's aircraft encountered ten American aircraft, and he shot down nine of them. The small People's Air Force and anti-aircraft units have shot down hundreds of enemy aircraft. The Syngman Rhee bandit army concentrated two-thirds of its total strength near the 38th parallel, including the "White Bone" unit (suicide squad) armed with the Hwarangdo (similar to Japanese Bushido) spirit. Countless steel and concrete bunkers and trenches were built along the line, and a very strict network of fire was organized with American heavy weapons and various automatic firearms. However, in just three days, the People's Army completely defeated the bandit army here, and the trenches and bunkers became the graves of a large number of bandits. In the Dongducheon and Uijeongbu areas, two regiments of a certain unit of the People's Army smashed two or three reinforcements of the Syngman Rhee army, killing and capturing more than three thousand people. On the night of the third day, the defeated bandits swarmed across the Han River like maggots, fleeing south for their lives. After crossing the river, the bandit leader Syngman Rhee immediately blew up the river bridge, leaving the bandits behind to fend for themselves. Many bandit army vehicles rushed from the broken bridge straight to the bottom of the river.
    On the morning of June 28th, the People's Army entered Seoul amidst a sea of people waving red flags and flowers. The people picked up the soldiers and shouted "Long live!" In front of the puppet presidential palace, an old man of fifty told the soldiers with mixed tears of grief and joy: "I never thought that Korea would really have today! I have to live another fifty years!" In every corner of Seoul, the people twisted the heads of the scattered bandits who had disguised themselves and failed to escape and sent them to the People's Army; they also led the soldiers to climb mountains and drill holes (Seoul has many mountains), searching everywhere. A soldier can search for and capture twenty or thirty scattered bandits a day.
    In early July, the Syngman Rhee army's front line on the south bank of the Han River was also broken through after three days and three nights of bloody battles. The last four or five divisions of the Syngman Rhee army became corpses and prisoners; some became scattered soldiers and guerrillas, running rampant everywhere. The People's Army advanced south at a speed of twenty kilometers a day.
  Defeat the Lackey, Defeat its Master
    The lackey was defeated, and the master came out. Starting from the Osan and Pyeongtaek line, the People's Army officially came into contact with the American land forces. Facing the world's number one imperialist "power," the heroic People's Army showed no difficulty. In the first small contact in Osan, the mechanized 24th Division of the American army was killed and captured more than a hundred. The People's Army bravely pursued in the torrential rain of July, and annihilated nearly three hundred more enemies in Pyeongtaek. More than five hundred American soldiers fled to Cheonan, and the People's Army detoured from both sides and annihilated all the enemies. Three medical orderlies of the People's Army, carrying a gun, drove about twenty American soldiers in the vicinity of Cheonan to flee in chaos, and the enemy's jeep was also damaged. In Gongju, which has strong fortifications, an American howitzer battalion, along with its personnel and artillery, became prisoners and corpses. In the famous Battle of Daejeon, more than 3,000 American soldiers of the 24th Division were cleanly eliminated. Two of the division's four regimental commanders were killed in battle, and two were captured. Division Commander Dean also disappeared. Among the thousands of vehicles captured by the People's Army was Dean's own small jeep.
    At the same time, the American army was also miserably defeated on the eastern front.
  Help Comes from All Directions
    The South Korean people, like the North Korean people, cheered in unison and extended a helping hand to the People's Army from all directions, assisting the People's Army in combat amidst the artillery fire. An eleven-year-old child carries a large shell and can walk with the army for seven or eight days. A thirteen-year-old child drives an animal-drawn cart and can walk with the army for more than ten days. The People's Army asks them to go back, but they must deliver it to their destination. Old ladies put large jars on their heads and send the rice they are reluctant to eat to the People's Army, and repeatedly urge: "Children, eat more, don't go hungry!" They put their lips to the ears of the soldiers and quietly tell them: "More than three hundred Americans went east," "More than five hundred Americans went south"... On the road of the People's Army's advance, the people in various places are generally mobilized, and men, women, old and young start together, repairing bridges and roads day and night. The enemy uses airplanes to bomb, but they cannot disperse them; they use artillery to bombard, but they cannot disperse them. North of Daejeon, a car driver drove a car to deliver ammunition to the People's Army. An American plane chased and strafed, and he struggled tenaciously with the enemy plane on the highway. The enemy plane failed to hit him time after time. On the seventh frenzied charge, he rushed close to the ground and burned himself against the rocks. The car driver advanced victoriously.
    Crossing the corpses of American soldiers, the People's Army soldiers advanced in a torrent with bayonets and grenades in their hands. The American army, while cursing the People's Army for fighting "barbarously" (so-called "fighting without following military textbooks") and cursing the Korean people for "all being Red bandits," fled south for their lives. Only a month after the outbreak of the war, the American army had fled in a puff of smoke to the southeast corner of the Nakdong River. The People's Army pursued across the Nakdong River, fought for half a month, and annihilated more than 6,000 American troops who were stubbornly resisting. In the mountainous operations in the Changnyeong area, a soldier of a certain unit charged up a mountain occupied by more than forty American soldiers and annihilated all the enemies in more than a dozen foxholes with bayonets and grenades. When he returned victoriously, he brought back more than a dozen American prisoners alone.
  Attacking the Enemy Behind Enemy Lines
    After the American invasion forces launched a large-scale landing in Incheon, the People's Army was temporarily at a disadvantageous and unfavorable position. But they did not lose heart, nor did they "collapse" as the American army advertised. They transferred in an orderly manner by different routes, basically preserving the main force. The broad masses of farmers fully assisted the troops and continued to seize every opportunity to attack the enemy. During the transfer of a certain division, not only did it suffer no loss, but it also won many victories, annihilating thousands of enemies. In the vast areas of Gapyeong, Yangyang, Gimhwa, Pyeonggang, and even Jinju and Masan, the People's Army and the people's guerrillas were integrated, relying on the mountains to disrupt the enemy's transportation lines day and night, and attacking enemy strongholds and moving troops, linking the war of points and lines into a broad war of areas. During the activities of a certain division of the People's Army in the Cheorwon area, when the enemy concentrated heavy troops to attack, they gave way to the enemy; when the enemy was dispersed and stationed, they concentrated their forces to implement piecemeal attacks and recover lost ground. Repeatedly, they finally liberated Cheorwon, Pyeonggang, and Yeoncheon and other cities. Other parts of the People's Army have also created many inspiring tactics and achievements. In this way, they successfully persevered in the most difficult period; and achieved development in some aspects. In late October, the Chinese People's Volunteers, in order to extinguish the flames of aggression that burned to the door of the motherland, crossed the Yalu River and severely attacked the American aggressors, quickly changing the situation of the Korean War. The news of the People's Volunteers crossing the river and advancing south spread like wildfire, and the Korean military and civilians were jubilant. The People's Army immediately launched a victorious counter-offensive in various places and fought side by side with the Volunteers. In the battles to liberate Seoul for the second time and other places in early January of this year, they made new contributions to the Korean people.
  "Not Taking Revenge Does Not Count as a Korean Soldier!"
    The three months of the American army's large-scale offensive and second rout were the darkest period in Korean history and also the darkest period in human history. Hundreds of thousands of Korean patriots and innocent people, unarmed women and children, were massacred by the American-Rhee bandits with all kinds of the most barbaric and cruel methods. In Incheon, in Yeongdeungpo, in Chuncheon, Daejeon... in all the towns and villages trampled by the bandit gangs, hundreds or thousands or even tens of thousands of people died tragically under the knives of the bandits. In Seoul after the second liberation, the People's Committee took in thousands of children who had lost their mothers and mothers who had lost their children. The tens of thousands of people remaining in Seoul (less than one-twentieth of the original population), under the sheds built of broken tiles, cried to the People's Army soldiers about the heinous crimes of the American-Rhee bandits. When the son was killed, the mother went to bury the body and was also killed. When the wife caressed her husband's body and cried a few times, she was stabbed and maimed. A four-year-old child who was about to starve to death was found by a worker from the Korean Democratic Women's Union to find his mother, but the mother was no longer able to move and could no longer find food for the child! The child cried, the mother cried, and the people next to them cried. Tears washed away the blood and mud on their faces, sobbing uncontrollably. The soldiers' eyes were bursting with sour tears, sparking with fire, and shouting loudly: "Compatriots, take revenge! Not taking revenge does not count as a Korean! Not taking revenge does not count as a Korean soldier!" At many gatherings of women, youth, and children, millions of people waved their tears and shouted the same voice.
    On the anniversary of the founding of the People's Army, American aircraft indiscriminately bombed peaceful Korean villages day and night, and American artillery roared all night. On the road from the south bank of the Han River to Suwon, new piles and rows of corpses of innocent people were added. The People's Army soldiers, agitated by old and new hatreds, are fighting side by side with the Volunteers, killing piles and rows of American-Rhee bandits who are frantically counterattacking next to the corpses of the Korean people. American planes are shot down daily by the People's Army soldiers with machine guns. American tanks are often overturned by explosive packs and grenades. On the radio of the People's Army, the news of the people's guerrillas in the Taebaek Mountains recovering the city of Jeongseon came. The People's Army troops accepted a large number of new soldiers who automatically enlisted. At the founding anniversary celebration, twelve-year-old girl Kim Mun-ja requested to join the army to avenge her parents. The workers' representatives from Gyeonggi Province swore that no matter how fierce the enemy's airplanes and artillery are, they will guarantee that the bridges and roads needed by the People's Army and the Volunteers are always open. The farmers' representatives swore that they would save grain in every possible way to ensure that the People's Army had enough to eat. The People's Army representatives swore to the people: No matter how many difficulties there are on the road ahead, we must finally eliminate the American aggressors and liberate all of Korea! We must live up to the people! We will not disappoint the people's expectations of us! The Chinese People's Volunteers support us! The people of the Soviet Union and the world support us! Our struggle is not isolated, we will surely triumph in the end!

　　英雄的军队，你一定胜利！
    本报记者  林韦
    今年二月八日汉城市民庆祝朝鲜人民军建军三周年时，一个名叫金顺玉的青年在他的祝词中写道：
    “朝鲜三千里锦绣江山，
    被美国强盗烧成一片荒土：
    荒土上浸着被害同胞的血和泪，
    土底下埋着被害同胞的尸体。………
    伟大的人民军，
    亲爱的战士，
    人民把一切感谢集中于你，
    把祖国的未来寄托给你。
    在反抗美国侵略者的斗争中，
    人民用一切力量支持你。
    你必须胜利！
    你一定胜利！”
    人民军必须胜利，一定胜利，这是受尽帝国主义践踏的朝鲜三千万苦难人民的心声，也是朝鲜人民军全体将士的英雄思想和坚强不拔的意志。人民军没有辜负人民的期望，也永远不会辜负人民的期望。
  在反侵略战斗中成长壮大
    美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和朝鲜人民抵抗侵略的战争，实际上从一九四九年就开始了。那年七月二十五日，驻扎开城的李承晚傀儡军第一师，在美国军事顾问指挥下，手持美国武器，以突然的猛攻夺去了三八线以北的松岳山高地。附近的村庄、学校被轰毁，农民和学生、教师被屠杀。刚刚分得土地的人民，又流着眼泪，准备重新逃难。这时候，建军不到一年半、人数也不多的人民军英勇地挺身而出，在松岳山的砂坡上与敌浴血奋战，反复冲杀，杀死匪徒一百多，终于把匪徒们逐回原处。消息一阵风传遍各地，各式各样的慰劳品，无数的鲜花和旗帜，从各个角落流到人民军和六十多个烈士的家里。在山野田间，人民以崇高的敬意和热情的眼泪传诵着苏联“普通一兵”式的伟大青年烈士严益燮的英雄事迹：在收复松岳山四八八高地的战斗中，他连续参加四次突击，最后奋不顾身地扑到火苗乱冒着的敌人重机枪跟前，用自己的身体堵塞枪口，让其他同志冲上高地，歼灭敌人。在严益燮烈士的家乡黄海道安岳郡，人民举行了庄严隆重的典礼，将国家授予烈士的国旗勋章赠给烈士的家属。
    踏着烈士的血迹，千百万朝鲜人民走上抗美斗争的光荣道路。在一九四五年以后获得土地、获得稳固职业、获得民主权利的广大农民、工人、知识分子，纷纷自动报名入伍，兄弟、姐妹、亲友、同学相率入伍的，各地都有。许多在日本统治时代四处乱跑，逃避兵役的青壮男子，现在都自动跑来报名参军。人民军迅速地壮大、巩固，成为一支强有力的人民军队。去年六月以前的一年中，美国侵略者策动傀儡李承晚，向三八线以北松岳山、银坡山、葛山、拥镇一带发动过数百次进攻，每一次都被这支人民军队击败，狼狈退到三八线南。
  接受人民要求，惩罚纵火者
    人民的忍耐逐渐达到再也不能忍耐的地步，他们不能容许战争的灾祸无休止地发展下去。许多人写信给人民军，提出同一意见：“敌人能打过来残杀我们，我们为什么不能追过去惩罚敌人？”银坡里农会来给人民军写信说：“只要把肇祸者消灭，人民军要什么我们给什么！否则田无法种，人无法活……我们连耕牛也都被拉走杀了！”
    五月下旬，朝鲜祖国统一战线委员会派赴南朝鲜谈判和平的代表被美李匪帮捕杀了。六月二十四日，敌人下了总攻击令，准备已久的全线“北伐”开始了，朝鲜战争全面爆发了。但是，英雄的人民军没有让敌人按照计划将战火延烧到全朝鲜以至中国。沉重的铁锤，出其不意地将匪徒们全线击溃了。在银坡山、松岳山等地，匪徒们在溃退时遗弃了大批的尸首。
    让那些丧尽天良的人类公敌去说人民军“侵略”南朝鲜吧！以人民的意志为意志，人民军在二十五日击退敌人的进攻以后，高举起扑灭战火的大旗，跨过三八线向南挺进！他们向人民宣誓，向金日成将军宣誓，决心严厉惩罚那些永远不肯自动放弃屠刀的凶手、匪徒、纵火者！
    欢声震撼着所有的城镇和乡村，激励战士们奋勇杀敌的信件雪片一样地飞来。涟川一个年青的妻子写信告诉丈夫：“政府帮助咱，邻舍帮助咱，我和孩子都过得很好。只要你们能把敌人赶走，咱家的光景就再不会变坏了。”金川的小学生来信说：“人民军叔叔们！赶快把那些魔鬼打走，我们就再不用挨美国的大炮啦（三八线上敌军炮兵天天向北试射，打死许多人）！我们的学习计划就能够完成啦！”“争取祖国独立统一！”“争取和平民主！”“打倒美国帝国主义！”的吼声，响彻朝鲜各个角落。
  奋不顾身勇猛前进
    人民的义愤和愿望激励着人民军战士们。他们在战斗中是那样的奋不顾身！许多军事史上的奇迹，在这儿出现。李东奎一架飞机与十架美机遭遇，他把九架美机击落了。为数不大的人民空军及高射部队，先后击落敌机数百架。三八线一带集中着李承晚匪军总兵力的三分之二，包括以花郎道（类似日本武士道）精神武装了的“白骨”部队（敢死队），沿线筑有无数钢骨水泥的地堡、战壕，又用美国的重武器和各种自动火器组织了十分严密的火网。可是仅仅三天，人民军便把这里的匪军全部冲垮了，战壕和地堡成了大量匪军的坟墓。在东豆川，议政府地区，李匪军两三个增援的师团，被人民军某部两个团打得稀烂，被击毙的和被俘的有三千余人。第三天夜间，溃匪像蛆虫一样拥过汉江，向南逃命。匪首李承晚过江后，立即把江桥炸断，一任后面匪众自生自灭。许多匪军的汽车，从桥断处一直冲到江底去了。
    六月二十八日晨，人民军在挥舞着红旗和鲜花的人海中进入汉城。人民把战士抱起来高呼“万岁！”在伪总统府门前，一个五十岁的老头流着悲喜交集的泪告诉战士：“想不到我们朝鲜真会有今天啊！我还得再活五十年！”在汉城各个角落，人民把化了装未及逃走的散匪扭着头发送交人民军；又领着战士爬山钻洞（汉城多山），到处搜捕。一个战士一天可以搜捕到散匪二、三十名。
    七月初头，汉江南岸的李匪军阵线也在三天三夜血战以后被突破了。李匪的最后四、五个师团，一部成了死尸、俘虏；一部做了散兵、游勇，遍地乱钻乱窜。人民军以一天二十公里的速度向南挺进。
  打败奴才打它的主人
    奴才战败了，主人出来了。从乌山、平泽一线开始，人民军正式与美国的陆上部队接火。面对着世界上第一号的帝国主义“强国”，英雄的人民军没有表现丝毫难色。乌山初次小接触，机械化的美军二十四师被打死、活捉一百多。人民军冒着七月的倾盆大雨勇猛追击，在平泽又歼敌近三百人。五百多美军逃至天安，人民军从两侧迂回过去，将敌全部歼灭。人民军三个卫生员带着一支枪，在天安附近把二十来个美国兵打得乱逃，敌人的吉普车也被打坏了。在筑有坚固工事的公州，美军一个榴弹炮营连人带炮一齐做了俘虏和死尸。著名的大田战斗中，美军二十四师的三千多人被干净消灭。该师四个团长，两个战死，两个被俘。师长迪安也失踪了。在人民军缴获的千余辆汽车中，有迪安本人乘坐的小吉普。
    与此同时，美军在东线也惨败了。
  四面八方伸来援手
    南朝鲜人民和北朝鲜人民一样齐声欢呼，从四面八方向人民军伸出援助之手，在炮火中协助人民军作战。十一岁的孩子扛上一颗大炮弹，能随军走上七、八天。十三岁的孩子赶上一辆牲口车，能随军走上十多天。人民军让他们回去，他们非送到目的地不可。老大娘们头上顶着大罐子，把自己舍不得吃的大米饭送给人民军，还一再催促：“孩子们多吃些，不要饿着了！”她们把嘴唇贴在战士耳朵上，悄悄告诉战士：“三百多美国人东去了”，“五百多美国人南去了”……。忠州一个六十二岁的老头写信来说：“我有三个儿子，一个女儿。人民军如果需要，我把他们都送去服务。”在人民军前进的道路上，各地人民都实行总动员，男女老少一齐下手，没明没夜地修桥补路。敌人用飞机炸，炸不散；用大炮轰，轰不散。在大田北面，一个汽车驾驶员开着车给人民军送弹药。一架美国飞机追来扫射，他就在公路上猛一进，猛一退，顽强地同敌机搏斗。敌机一次一次打不中。第七次疯狂猛冲，冲近地面，碰在山岩上自焚了。汽车驾驶员却胜利前进。
    跨过美军的尸体，人民军战士们手持刺刀手榴弹，汹涌前进。美军一面咒骂人民军打仗“野蛮”（所谓“不按军事教科书打仗”），咒骂朝鲜人民“尽是赤匪”，一面没命地向南奔逃。战争爆发后仅仅一月，美军便一溜烟逃到洛东江东南的海角上去了。人民军追过洛东江，搏战半月，又把负隅顽抗的美军歼灭了六千多。在昌宁一带的山地作战中，某部一个战士冲上有四十多名美军据守的山头，用刺刀和手榴弹把敌人全部消灭在十多个散兵坑里。胜利归来时，他一个人带着十多个美国俘虏。
  在敌后打击敌人
    美国侵略军大规模登陆仁川之后，人民军曾暂时处于劣势和不利的地位。但他们没有气馁，更没有像美军宣传的那样“陷于崩溃”。他们有秩序地分路转移，基本上保存了主力。广大农民全力协助部队，继续争取一切机会打击敌人。某师在转移期间，不仅未受丝毫损失，而且打了许多胜仗，歼灭敌人数千名。在加平、襄阳、金化、平康直至晋州、马山的广大地区，人民军与人民的游击队结成一体，依托山地，不分昼夜地破坏敌人交通运输线，袭击敌军据点和运动中的部队，把点线的战争联成广阔的面的战争。人民军某师在铁原地区活动期间，敌人集结重兵进攻时，他们让路给敌人；敌人分散驻守时，他们集中起来实行各个击破，收复失地。反复数次，终于解放了铁原、平康、涟川等城。人民军其他部分，也创造了许多令人振奋的战法和战绩。就这样，他们在最困难的时期胜利地坚持下来；并得到若干方面的发展。十月下旬，中国人民志愿军为了扑灭烧到祖国大门的侵略火焰，渡过鸭绿江，痛击美国侵略者，迅速改变了朝鲜战争的形势。人民志愿军渡江南进的消息如野火飞传，朝鲜军民欢欣鼓舞。人民军立即在各地转入胜利的反攻，与志愿军并肩作战。在今年一月初二次解放汉城等地的战斗中，他们又为朝鲜人民立下新的功勋。
  “不报仇不算朝鲜的战士！”
    美军大规模进攻和二次溃逃的三个多月中，是朝鲜历史上最黑暗的时期，也是人类历史上最黑暗的时期。数十万朝鲜的爱国志士和无辜人民、手无寸铁的妇女儿童，被美李匪帮用各种各样最野蛮、最残忍的手段屠杀了。在仁川，在永登浦，在春川、大田……在所有匪帮践踏过的城镇乡村，都有成百成千以至上万的人民惨死在匪徒们的屠刀下。在二次解放后的汉城，人民委员会收容了数千名失掉妈妈的孩子和失掉孩子的妈妈。留在汉城的数万人民（不及原有人口二十分之一），在破瓦堆里搭起的棚子下面，向人民军战士哭诉美李匪帮的滔天罪行。儿子被杀了，母亲去掩埋尸体，也被杀了。妻子抚着丈夫尸体哭了几声，被刺得残废了。一个四岁的快要饿死了的孩子被朝鲜民主妇女同盟工作员领着找见了妈妈，妈妈已经不能走动，不能再为孩子寻找食物了！孩子哭，母亲也哭，旁边的人跟着哭。泪水冲洗着脸上的血迹和泥污，泣不成声。战士们两眼迸着酸泪，冒着火星，高声地喊：“同胞们，报仇啊！不报仇不算朝鲜人！不报仇不算朝鲜的战士！”在许多妇女、青年、儿童的集会上，千万人挥着泪，喊出同一声音。
    人民军建军三周年纪念的时候，美国的飞机竟日滥炸朝鲜的和平村庄，美国的大炮整夜轰响。汉江南岸到水原的路上，又新添了成堆成行的无辜人民的尸体。人民军战士被旧恨新仇激荡着，正在与志愿军并肩奋战，把疯狂反扑的美李匪帮成堆成行地打死在朝鲜人民尸体的旁边。美国的飞机，每天被人民军战士用机关枪击落。美国的坦克，时常被炸药包、手榴弹打翻。人民军的电台的广播里，传来了太白山区人民游击队收复旌善城的消息。人民军部队里，接受了大批自动入伍的新战士。在建军纪念会上，十二岁女孩金文子要求参军，为父母报仇。京畿道的工人代表宣誓：不管敌人飞机大炮打得多凶，一定保证人民军和志愿军所需要的桥梁道路经常畅通。农民代表宣誓，要用一切方法节省粮食，保证人民军吃粮。人民军代表向人民宣誓：不管前进道路上还有多少困难，我们一定要最后消灭美国侵略军，解放全朝鲜！我们一定要对得起人民！不辜负人民对我们的期望！中国人民志愿军支援我们！苏联和全世界的人民支援我们！我们的斗争不孤立，我们一定最后胜利！
