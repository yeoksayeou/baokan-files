Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 19th. The Wuhan Municipal Military Control Commission, accepting the just demands of the broad masses of the people of Wuhan, executed a group of arch-criminals of counter-revolution on the 16th.

Among these counter-revolutionaries executed, some were special agent murderers who suppressed the student movement and massacred students. For example, the criminals Niu Junbin, Hao Zhao, Wang Yukun, Hu Huixue, Yang Hanyi, etc., led more than a thousand armed bandits to arrest students on a large scale at Wuhan University on June 1, 1947, killing students Huang Minggang, Wang Zhide, Chen Rufeng, and others on the spot, and wounding 20 students. This created the "June 1st" massacre that the people of the whole country will never forget with grief and indignation. Among them, bandit Niu Junbin was an old special agent of the Kuomintang reactionary government's military police special agent organization. In 1938, he infiltrated our Yan'an Anti-Japanese Military and Political University to spy on military and political secrets. Since then, he has been engaged in slaughtering the people for more than ten years, committing numerous bloody crimes.

Some were extremely heinous elements who had consistently been enemies of the people and resolutely engaged in counter-revolutionary activities. For example, Xiang Jinhou, an executive member of the Kuomintang Hubei Provincial Party Headquarters and director of the Eastern Hubei Party Affairs Office, commanded local reactionary armed forces in Xishui, Guangji, Lishan, Huanggang, Tuanfeng, Lijiachang, and other places, shooting and burying alive more than a thousand New Fourth Army cadres, soldiers, and local people who persisted in the War of Resistance Against Japan in these areas, and forced farmers to jump into the river near Shashiqiao, Tuanfeng, causing more than 100 people to drown. After the liberation of Wuhan, this bandit continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. Lu Liang, the chief special agent of the bandit "Wuhan Inspection Office Criminal Team," searched and arrested more than 50 progressive people in Hankou Jijiazui, Changdi Street, Wenshu Lane, and other places, and put them all in sacks and threw them into the river. Chai Hailou, a senior Kuomintang military intelligence agent, Shu Jiading, secretary of the Kuomintang Central Bureau of Statistics Wuhan Second Station, Jiang Jiu, who served as the head of the Japanese Wuhan Garrison Headquarters' plainclothes team, and Liu Renchu, who served as the chief of the Japanese Wuhan Intelligence Section, were all executioners who had been engaged in counter-revolutionary activities for many years and whose hands were stained with the blood of the people. In addition to undermining the people's revolutionary cause and killing revolutionary patriots, they also framed the people, seized property, trafficked "conscripts," and raped women, committing countless crimes.

There was also a group of armed special agents who conspired to organize riots. For example, bandits Song Hanyun, Zheng Xinrou, Zhang Zhizhong, Li Lianhai, Huang Xinyu, etc., successively organized reactionary organizations such as the bandit "National Defense Ministry Youth Salvation Corps Jianghan Volunteer Third Detachment Third Brigade," "Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi People's Anti-Communist Shock Army Headquarters Hubei Command Post," and "Dabie Mountain People's Anti-Communist Salvation Army Fifth Route Third Column Ninth Detachment," actively manufactured poison and explosives, carried out poisoning assassinations, sabotaged production and construction, and conspired to subvert the people's regime.

After these counter-revolutionaries were sentenced to death, they were all escorted to the places where they committed the most evil deeds for execution, according to the people's demands. When the special agent elements Wang Yukun, Hao Zhao, Yang Hanyi, and other 11 bandits who created the "June 1st" massacre were escorted to Luojia Mountain in Wuchang and executed in front of the "June 1st" Martyrs' Tomb, more than 5,000 teachers and students of Wuhan University and nearby farmers simultaneously held a public memorial meeting for the "June 1st" martyrs.

　　武汉处决一批反革命首恶分子
  　匪徒们被押到作恶最多的地方和烈士墓前当众枪毙
  　双手沾满人民鲜血的匪徒伏法后人心大快
    【新华社汉口十九日电】武汉市军事管制委员会接受武汉市广大人民的正义要求，于十六日枪决了一批反革命首要分子。
    在枪决的这些反革命分子中，有的是镇压学生运动、屠杀学生的特务凶犯。如牛俊彬、郝钊、王裕昆、胡挥血、杨汉颐等犯，于一九四七年六月一日带领千余武装匪徒在武汉大学大肆逮捕学生，当场杀死了学生黄鸣岗、王志德、陈如丰等三人，击伤学生二十人。造成全国人民悲愤难忘的“六、一”惨案。其中牛匪俊彬是国民党反动政府宪兵特务组织的老特务，曾于一九三八年打入我延安抗日军政大学刺探军政机密，以后十余年来一贯从事屠杀人民的勾当，血案累累。
    有一些是一贯与人民为敌，坚决进行反革命活动的罪大恶极分子。如国民党湖北省党部执行委员兼鄂东党务办事处主任向近候，曾在浠水、广济、礼山、黄冈、团风、李家场等地指挥当地反动武装，枪杀、活埋在这些地区坚持抗日战争的新四军干部、战士及当地人民千余人，并在团风沙石桥附近逼迫农民跳河，致淹死一百多人。武汉解放后，该匪仍继续从事反革命活动。匪“武汉稽查处刑事队”的首要特务分子鲁亮，曾在汉口集稼嘴、长堤街、文书巷等地搜捕进步人士五十余人，均用麻袋装捆投入江中。国民党军统高级特务柴海楼、中统武汉第二站书记舒家鼎、当过日寇武汉警备司令部便衣队长的江纠、曾任日寇武汉情报科长的刘人储，都是多年从事反革命活动，双手沾满人民鲜血的刽子手。他们除破坏人民革命事业，残杀革命志士外，平日并陷害人民、霸占产业、买卖“壮丁”、奸淫妇女，罪恶不可胜举。
    还有一批是阴谋组织暴乱的武装特务分子。如宋汉云、郑心瑈、张志忠、李连海、黄新宇等匪，先后组织匪“国防部青年救国团江汉义勇第三总队第三支队”、“湘鄂赣人民反共突击军总指挥部湖北指挥所”、“大别山人民反共救国军第五路第三纵队第九支队”等反动组织，积极制造毒药、炸药，进行放毒暗杀、破坏生产建设，阴谋颠覆人民政权。
    这些反革命分子经判处死刑后，都根据人民要求分别解往作恶最多的地方执行枪决。制造“六、一”惨案的特务分子王裕昆、郝钊、杨汉颐等十一名匪徒，被押到武昌珞珈山，在“六、一”烈士墓前执行枪决时，武汉大学全体师生及附近农民共五千多人，同时举行了公祭“六、一”死难烈士大会。
