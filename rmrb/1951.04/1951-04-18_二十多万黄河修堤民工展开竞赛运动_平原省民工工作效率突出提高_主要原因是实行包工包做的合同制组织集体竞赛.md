　　Over 200,000 Yellow River Embankment Workers Launch Emulation Drive
    Work Efficiency of Workers in Pingyuan Province Significantly Increased
    Main Reason: Implementation of Contract System with Piecework Pay and Organization of Collective Competition
    Since the full-scale commencement of the Yellow River spring repair project, over 200,000 workers along the entire river have universally launched a fervent patriotic emulation campaign, with a significant increase in work efficiency compared to previous years. Pingyuan Province's achievements are particularly outstanding, and their experience is relatively good. The workers in the province participating in the Yellow River levee restoration project are averaging four to six cubic meters of earthwork per person per day. Song Bing, a worker from Wuzhi County in the province, set a record on March 17th by moving 53.54 cubic meters of earth in eight hours over a distance of 26 meters. The achievements of individual work teams or groups are also significant. For example, the Tian Zhaoyi worker team from Yuncheng County, with 41 members, moved an average of 6.27 cubic meters of earth per person per day over a distance of 210 meters; the Jia Jilun worker team from Shouzhang County, with 45 members, moved an average of 11.65 cubic meters of earth per person per day over a distance of 80 meters; the Wang Zhilan worker team from Juancheng, with 15 members, worked continuously for 47 shifts, with an average efficiency of 12.43 cubic meters of earth.
    The emulation campaign launched by the Pingyuan Province worker teams has two significant characteristics: (1) It has shifted from individual competition in previous years to collective competition between groups and teams. (2) The workers' enthusiasm for participating in the competition has remained consistently high, and the progress of the emulation campaign has been very steady. The worker teams in the province have adopted various methods to carry out this emulation campaign. A relatively successful method is the "擂台" (lèitái, arena/platform for martial arts competition) or challenge system used by the workers in Juancheng County. This challenge method was first initiated by the worker team led by Wu Chonghua, a water conservancy model worker in the province. On March 17th, the team set its challenge conditions: 1. The entire team of 26 people guarantees a wage of 60 catties of rice per person per day (each person must move 22.86 cubic meters of earth per day). 2. Coordinate well with the edge trimming and tamping workers to ensure the project meets standards. 3. The borrow pits must be dug well, and the carts should not spill earth. After other worker teams learned of this news, they immediately responded and set their own challenge conditions based on their actual situations. Now, more than 20 teams are participating in the challenge, and everyone's enthusiasm is very high. In addition, the "Heroes' Gathering" method adopted by the workers in Fanxian County, the red flag/black flag movement of the workers in Puxian County, and the "cow-grabbing" movement of the workers in Shouzhang, Dong'a, and Zhangqiu counties have all drawn the broad masses of workers into the emulation upsurge.
    The reason for the success of the patriotic emulation campaign launched by the Pingyuan Province worker teams is not only due to the thorough publicity, mobilization, and organization work before construction, but more importantly, the implementation of the contract system with piecework pay. When the province publicized and mobilized the workers to participate in levee repair, it simultaneously publicized the method of contracting work and signing contracts, enabling workers from various regions to voluntarily form teams. Through signing contracts, they had a clear understanding of the entire work before construction, and after construction started, they could immediately carry out work according to regulations and launch competition. In order to take care of spring planting production, the Pingyuan Province leading organs divided the levee restoration project into phases. After each worker team completed the contracted amount for each phase, they could return home early for production. At the same time, the workers all hoped to improve work efficiency through competition and earn more wages, so the workers' enthusiasm for participating in the competition was extremely high. In addition, the timely and appropriate commendation of activists and labor models among the workers by the leadership, as well as the improvement of work techniques and tools to encourage the workers' work enthusiasm and improve the workers' work efficiency, were also one of the reasons for the success of this emulation campaign.

　　二十多万黄河修堤民工展开竞赛运动
    平原省民工工作效率突出提高
    主要原因是实行包工包做的合同制组织集体竞赛
    黄河春修工程全面开始以后，沿河全线二十多万民工已普遍展开了炽热的爱国主义竞赛运动，民工工作效率较往年大为提高。其中平原省的成绩尤为突出，经验也比较好。该省参加黄河复堤工程的民工，平均每人每日作四至六土方。该省武陟县的民工宋炳，在三月十七日工作八小时，创造了在运距二十六公尺内推土五三点五四公方的最高纪录。个别民工队或组的成绩也很大，如郓城县田兆义民工队四十一人，运距二百一十公尺，平均每人每日作六点二七土方；寿张县贾继伦民工队四十五人，运距八十公尺，平均每人每日作十一点六五土方；鄄城王芝兰民工队十五人，运距一百公尺，连续作了四十七个工，平均效率始终是十二点四三土方。
    平原省民工队在开展这次竞赛运动中，有两个显著的特点：（一）由往年的个人与个人间的竞赛，转变为组与组间、队与队间的集体竞赛。（二）民工参加竞赛的热情始终很高，竞赛运动的进展很稳。该省民工队曾采用了各种不同的方式开展这次竞赛运动，其中比较成功的方式是鄄城县民工的打擂台（即挑战）。这种打擂台的方式，是由该省水利模范吴崇华所领导的民工队首先开始的。该队在三月十七日订出自己的打擂条件：一、全队二十六人，每人每天保证得工资米六十斤（每人每天须做二二点八六土方）。二、与边铣，硪工配合好，保证工程合标准。三、方塘要挖得好，推车不撒土。其他民工队知道这一消息后，立即响应，纷纷针对本队的实际情况，订出参加打擂的条件。现在参加打擂的已是二十多队，大家情绪非常高涨。此外，范县民工队采用的“群英会”的办法，濮县民工队的红旗黑旗运动、寿张、东阿、张秋等县民工队的夺牛运动，也都使广大民工卷入了竞赛的热潮。
    平原省民工队这次开展爱国主义竞赛运动所以有成绩，除了施工前的宣传动员和组织工作深入以外，最重要的原因是实行了包工包做的合同制。该省在宣传动员民工参加修堤时，即同时宣传了包工包做订合同的办法，使各地民工自愿结合成队，通过订合同，在开工前对整个工作有了明确的了解，开工以后，立即可以按规定进行工作，展开竞赛。为了照顾春耕生产，平原省领导机关又将复堤工程分期进行，各民工队将每期包工包做的数量作完以后，即可早日回家生产；同时，民工们又都希望通过竞赛提高工作效率，多得工资，所以民工们参加竞赛的热情极高。此外，领导方面及时地适当地表扬民工中的积极分子和劳动模范，以及改进工作技术和工具，以鼓励民工的工作热情和提高民工工作效率，也是这次竞赛运动得以成功的原因之一。
