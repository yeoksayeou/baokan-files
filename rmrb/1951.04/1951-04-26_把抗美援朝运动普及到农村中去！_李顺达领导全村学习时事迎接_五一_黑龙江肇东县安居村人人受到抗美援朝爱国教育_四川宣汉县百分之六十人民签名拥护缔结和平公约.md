　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 25th. The village of Li Shunda, a nationally renowned model agricultural laborer, Xigou Village in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, is intensifying its current affairs studies to welcome the May Day Labor Day and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.

　　The Xigou Village branch of the Communist Party of China, in response to the call of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC, promoted the village to convene a village people's representative meeting on April 15 to discuss the issue of welcoming May Day and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. At the meeting, a village Resist America, Aid Korea Committee was elected and five formal decisions were passed and implemented from the 16th. The five decisions are: 1. From the 16th to the 25th, the whole village will conduct current affairs studies. First, invite a reporter from the county to give a popular and concise current affairs report to village cadres, propagandists, and peasant activists, and then the propagandists will divide the work and use lunch breaks and evenings to promote to the peasants. 2. From the 26th to the 30th, convene mass meetings and meetings of youth, women, militia, etc., to mobilize peasants to accuse the imperialist crimes of aggression and raise their awareness and patriotic enthusiasm. At the same time, check the thoughts of cadres and peasants and solve problems such as some peasants not caring about the current situation. 3. Prepare for the May Day demonstration parade, prepare to hold a signature campaign to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact, and vote against arming Japan. Activists should unite the masses separately to ensure the participation of the whole village. 4. The village's civil schools and blackboards will focus on current affairs education in the second half of April. 5. Checks and summaries will be carried out on April 26, 30, and May 2, respectively.

　　Now, the entire Xigou Village is intensively conducting current affairs studies. After the village held a family representative meeting on April 20, the movement has penetrated every family. All members of the Li Shunda mutual aid group have signed the World Peace Council declaration and have held a vote against arming Japan.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 25th. The farmers of Anju Village, Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, have all received patriotic education to resist America and aid Korea. All 1,204 people in the village, except for children and patients, have heard more than three times of propaganda on resisting America and aiding Korea; and participated in signing in support of the conclusion of a peace pact and voting against the United States arming Japan and separately concluding peace with Japan.

　　The village's sixteen propagandists and thirty activists divided the village into fourteen areas in early April to carry out extensive propaganda activities. The propagandists used the peasants' spare time to convene mass meetings and twenty-eight small meetings to conduct propaganda and organize accusations. More than 800 farmers from the village participated in these gatherings, accounting for more than 80% of the farmers in the village. After these gatherings were held, the propagandists also conducted inspections. They found that some individual farmers had not heard the propaganda. They visited door-to-door, especially to people who had not participated in the gatherings. After the peasants were generally exposed to the propaganda of resisting America and aiding Korea and had a relatively correct understanding of resisting America and aiding Korea, the village held a large-scale accusation meeting. At the meeting, eleven farmers who had suffered the deepest persecution by the Japanese invaders took the lead in making accusations, arousing the hatred of imperialism among those who had been oppressed by the Japanese invaders. Many people cried in grief and anger when making accusations. They gnashed their teeth and were extremely angry about the rearmament of Japan by US imperialism. After the accusation meeting, the peasants were in high spirits and immediately held a village demonstration parade. Grandma Zhang, 79, also participated in the parade with a cane.

　　Due to the general improvement of political consciousness among the farmers in the village, a patriotic pact for the whole village has been formulated. The thirty-seven mutual aid groups in the village have also formulated patriotic pacts and high-yield plans for each group according to the specific conditions of each group. They stipulated specific measures to actively resist America and aid Korea, oppose the United States arming Japan, and guarantee a bumper harvest this year in the patriotic pact and high-yield plan.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 25th. 872 farmers in Jinde Village, Shulan County, Jilin Province, have signed the World Peace Council declaration. In order to carry out this movement, in mid-March, the propagandists of the Jinde Village branch of the Communist Party of China first studied the World Peace Council declaration and Guo Moruo's report at the Berlin World Peace Council. Then, the Communist Party members, members of the New Democratic Youth League, people's representatives, and production team leaders in the village studied these documents together and formed a propaganda team to promote them to the farmers in the village. The propaganda team carried out a series of propaganda work through individual visits, organizing forums, and accusation meetings. During the Japanese occupation, seven farmers in the village were killed by the Japanese invaders, and 132 farmers were brutally beaten by the Japanese invaders. At the accusation meeting, after comparing the suffering they had suffered in the past with the free and happy life they have today, the farmers felt more the loveliness of the motherland and the hatred of the enemy. They were all outraged by the US imperialists' plan to rearm Japan and expressed their determination to oppose it to the end.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchong, 25th. The number of people in Xuanhan County, northern Sichuan, who signed in support of the conclusion of a peace pact has reached more than 482,000, accounting for 60% of the county's population. At the same time as the signing, the people of the county wrote more than 10,000 letters of condolence to the Chinese and Korean soldiers. The people in the urban and rural areas of the county held grand demonstration parades, with a total of more than 350,000 participants.

　　In the nearly one month since the launch of the signature campaign, the county has conducted large-scale current affairs propaganda and education. In the urban area alone, 142 groups were organized, with more than 6,000 people participating in current affairs studies. In the rural areas, the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda committees of each district and township have respectively convened more than 4,000 village propaganda team leaders, deputy village chiefs, peasant association directors, and activists to concentrate on studying for three days in each township and town, and then they returned to the village to carry out propaganda and mobilization among the masses. At the same time, full use was made of 365 blackboards, 160 rooftop broadcasts, and village reading groups in the county to conduct extensive propaganda. As a result, everyone in the county received anti-American patriotic education and education on defending world peace and was swept into the upsurge of signing in support of the conclusion of a peace pact.

    【新华社太原二十五日电】全国著名的农业劳动模范李顺达所在村，山西省平顺县的西沟村，为迎接“五一”劳动节和深入抗美援朝运动，全村现在正加紧进行时事学习。
    中国共产党西沟村支部响应中共山西省委的号召，曾推动该村在四月十五日召开了一次村人民代表会议，讨论迎接“五一”和深入抗美援朝运动问题。在会议上，选举成立了村抗美援朝委员会，并通过了五项正式决定，于十六日起开始实施。五项决定是：一、十六日到二十五日全村进行时事学习，先邀请县的报告员向村干部、宣传员和农民积极分子作一次通俗扼要的时事报告，然后由宣传员分工利用午间和晚间向农民宣传。二、二十六日到三十日分别召开群众大会和青年、妇女、民兵等会议，发动农民控诉帝国主义侵略罪行，提高其觉悟和爱国热忱。同时检查干部和农民的思想，解决部分农民不关心时局等问题。三、准备“五一”示威游行，准备举行要求五大国缔结和平公约的签名和反对武装日本的投票。积极分子要分别团结群众，保证全村参加。四、村中的民校和黑板报，在四月下半月都以时事教育为主要内容。五、四月二十六日、三十日和五月二日分别进行检查和总结。
    现在，西沟全村都在紧张地进行时事学习，四月二十日该村召开家庭代表会议后，运动已深入每一家庭。李顺达互助组的全体组员，已在世界和平理事会宣言上签了名，并已举行了反对武装日本的投票。
    【新华社齐齐哈尔二十五日电】黑龙江省肇东县安居村的农民，人人都受到了抗美爱国教育。该村一千二百零四人除小孩、病人等外都听到过三次以上的抗美援朝宣传；并参加了拥护缔结和平公约的签名和反对美国武装日本与单独对日媾和的投票。
    该村的十六名宣传员和三十名积极分子于四月上旬把全村分成十四个地区，展开广泛的宣传活动。宣传员们利用农民们的生产余暇分别召开了群众大会和二十八次小型会议，进行宣传和组织控诉。全村农民参加这些集会的达八百余人，占全村农民百分之八十以上。在这些集会召开后，宣传员们并进行了检查。他们发现还有个别农民没有听到宣传。他们就挨家访问，特别向没有参加过集会的人们进行宣传。在农民们普遍受到抗美援朝的宣传，对抗美援朝有了比较正确的认识以后，全村举行了一次大规模的控诉会。会上，曾经遭受日寇迫害最深的十一个农民带头控诉，激发了受过日寇压迫的人们对帝国主义的仇恨。许多人在控诉时悲愤痛哭。对于美帝国主义重新武装日本，他们都咬牙切齿，气愤万分。控诉会后，农民们情绪激昂，当即举行了全村的示威游行。七十九岁的张老太太也扶着拐杖参加游行。
    该村农民由于政治觉悟普遍提高，已订出全村的爱国公约。村中的三十七个互助组并按各组具体情况订了各组的爱国公约和丰产计划。他们在爱国公约和丰产计划中规定了积极抗美援朝，反对美国武装日本和保证今年丰收的具体办法。
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】吉林省舒兰县锦德村的农民，已有八百七十二人在世界和平理事会的宣言上签了名。为开展这个运动，三月中旬，锦德村中国共产党支部的宣传员，首先学习了世界和平理事会的宣言和郭沫若在柏林世界和平理事会上的报告。接着全村的共产党员、新民主主义青年团团员、人民代表和生产小组长又一齐学习了这些文件，并组成宣传队向全村农民宣传。宣传队以个别访问、组织座谈会和控诉会等方式，进行了一系列的宣传工作。该村在日本占领时期，有七个农民被日本侵略者杀害，一百三十二个农民受过日本侵略者的凶殴。在控诉会上，农民们将过去所受的痛苦，和今天的自由、幸福生活加以对比后，更感到祖国的可爱，敌人的可恨。他们对美帝国主义要重新武装日本，都怒不可遏地表示一定反对到底。
    【新华社南充二十五日电】川北宣汉县人民拥护缔结和平公约的签名人数已达四十八万二千多人，占全县人口百分之六十。与签名同时，该县人民写了一万多封慰问信，慰问中朝战士。全县城乡人民并分别举行了盛大的示威游行，参加游行的共有三十五万余人。
    在开展签名运动近一个月来，全县大规模进行了时事宣传教育。仅城区即组织了一百四十二个小组，六千多人参加了时事学习。在农村中，各区、乡的抗美援朝宣传委员会，曾分别召集了村宣传小组长、副村长、农民协会主任和积极分子等四千多人，在各乡、镇集中学习三天，再由他们回到村里向群众进行宣传动员。同时，并充分利用了全县三百六十五处黑板报、一百六十处屋顶广播及各村读报组等各种形式，进行了广泛的宣传。使得全县每个人都受到反美爱国与保卫世界和平的教育，卷入拥护缔结和平公约的签名热潮中。
