Guo Youqian Cleverly Captures Counter-Revolutionary Element

Guo Youqian, a baggage handler at the Tianjin Railway Bureau's North Station, was repeatedly told by his fellow villagers in his hometown of Tianjin County whenever he returned home after liberation: "The damned Guo Manzhi owes us a blood debt that has been accumulating for over twenty years. Now that we have the People's Government to support us, the day to avenge our grievances has arrived!" He kept these words firmly in mind, eagerly awaiting the day of retribution.

Eighteen years ago, the local tyrant Guo Manzhi and his father tried to force Guo Youqian's family to sell their sorghum stalks at a low price. Guo Youqian's father refused. The Guo family then set fire to the sorghum stalks and falsely accused Guo Youqian's father of deliberately starting the fire, arresting him, torturing him in private, and ultimately fining him five yuan. During the Japanese occupation, the four members of the Guo Manzhi family, some serving as puppet village chiefs and others as puppet county self-defense brigade commanders, rampantly persecuted the local people, constantly extorting "expenses" and "taxes." Those who couldn't pay were beaten and cursed. Guo Youqian's entire family was forced to scatter and become displaced. Four years ago, Guo Manzhi and his father organized the "Homecoming Corps" to attack the liberated areas, burying Guo Youqian's cousin, Guo Youming (a revolutionary cadre), alive and breaking his uncle, Guo Shikuan's, ribs.

These are just a small fraction of the crimes committed by Guo Manzhi and his father. It's impossible to count the number of other villagers who suffered from their persecution. For over twenty years, Guo Youqian had harbored intense hatred for the heinous Guo Manzhi. After liberation, he inquired about Guo Manzhi's whereabouts from everyone he knew, but he couldn't find any leads.

On the morning of March 29th this year, Guo Youqian finished his night shift and was walking home on Dajing Road in Tianjin North Station when he happened to encounter a man wearing a black cotton-padded coat, sunglasses, and leading a dog. He thought this man looked a lot like the traitorous agent Guo Manzhi. He wanted to immediately capture him and send him to the People's Government. However, he also realized that his strength alone might not be enough, and he might fail to catch him. He tried his best to calm down. To avoid Guo Manzhi noticing that he was being followed, Guo Youqian quickly put on his windproof glasses and followed him at a distance. When they reached Chenwei Road, the Guo bandit noticed someone was following him and panicked, whipping his dog and quickening his pace, darting into an alley. After passing through more than a dozen streets, the Guo bandit always avoided streets with police posts. Guo Youqian followed closely without letting up. After walking about five or six li, near the outside of the garden, the Guo bandit suddenly stopped, looked around cautiously, and sneaked into a toilet like a rat. Guo Youqian seized this opportunity and ran to the nearby police station to report. After a while, the Guo bandit poked his head out of the toilet, and seeing that the person who had been following him was gone, began to run away. At that moment, the police chief arrived on his bicycle and arrested the Guo bandit.

The director of the Tianjin Railway Bureau praised Guo Youqian's actions in assisting the government in arresting the counter-revolutionary element at a meeting where over six thousand employees of the bureau denounced the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements. Railway employees are encouraging each other to learn from Guo Youqian's spirit of acting as masters of their own affairs, and to expose and arrest counter-revolutionary elements.

### 郭有谦智擒反革命分子

　　郭有谦智擒反革命分子
    天津铁路局北站行李员郭有谦在解放后每次回到家乡——天津县的时候，乡亲们都这样嘱咐他：“罪该万死的郭满志欠下咱们血债已经二十来年了，今天有了人民政府给咱们作主，报仇雪恨的日子就到了。”他牢牢地记住这些话，盼望着报仇的日子的到来。
    十八年前，恶霸郭满志和他的父亲要用贱价强买郭有谦家里的秫秸。郭有谦的父亲没有答应。郭家父子俩就放火把秫秸烧掉，并诬告郭有谦的父亲故意放火烧村，将他逮捕起来，私刑拷打，临末了还要罚五块钱。日寇统治时期，恶霸郭满志父子四个，有的当了伪村长，有的当了伪县自卫大队长，更大肆残害当地人民，不是勒索这个“花销”，就是要那个“税”，没有钱交就毒打恶骂。郭有谦全家被逼迫得流离失散。四年前，恶霸郭满志和他的父亲又组织了“还乡团”袭击解放区，活埋了郭有谦的堂弟郭有名（革命干部），并将他叔父郭世宽的肋骨打断。
    这些只不过是恶霸郭满志父子罪行的一小部分，其他乡亲们遭受他父子的迫害是算不清的。二十来年来郭有谦无时无刻不把那恶贯满盈的郭满志记恨在心。解放后，他曾向所有认识郭满志的人打听郭满志的下落，但总没有找出线索来。
    今年三月二十九日早晨，郭有谦下了夜班回家，走在天津北站大经路上，恰巧遇见一个牵着狗、身穿黑大棉袄、戴着墨镜的男人。他看这个人很像汉奸特务郭满志，想立刻将他抓住，送到人民政府去。可是他又想一个人的力量不足，如果抓不住就坏了。他极力镇静下来。为了避免郭满志发现有人跟踪，郭有谦连忙把防风眼镜戴上，不即不离地跟在后面。到了辰纬路，郭匪发现后面有人跟踪，慌慌张张地用鞭子打狗，加快脚步，钻进了胡同。穿过十几条街道，郭匪始终躲着有警察岗位的街道走。郭有谦一步也不放松地紧跟在后面。大约走了五、六里，到了花园外的地方，郭匪突然停住脚步，东张西望了一下，就像老鼠一样地钻进厕所里。郭有谦机警地抓住这个机会，跑到附近的公安局派出所去报告。过了一会郭匪从厕所里探出头来，看到跟踪的人走了，便迈开大步逃跑。就在这个时候，警长骑车赶到，将郭匪逮捕。
    天津铁路管理局局长在该局六千余职工控诉反革命分子罪行的大会上，表扬了郭有谦协助政府逮捕反革命分子的事迹。铁路员工都互相勉励着要学习郭有谦当家作主的精神，检举和逮捕反革命分子。
