　　The Meaning of "Customs"
　　Editor:
　　Last January 27th, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Decision on Tariff Policy and Customs Work". I recently reread it, but my understanding of the term "customs" is still vague. Could you please explain it for me?
　　Reader Wang Xin

Wang Xin Comrade:
　　Your question is answered as follows: Customs is the state agency established at open foreign trade ports and at stations, airports, intersections, and other places where goods and passengers are allowed to enter and exit the country, to actually supervise goods entering and leaving the country. Its primary duty is to check whether goods entering or leaving the country have been approved for import or export by the Foreign Trade Administration, and whether there are any prohibited imports or prohibited exports. Secondly, it levies different tariffs on various goods according to the tariff schedule. Finally, it fights against smuggling, thereby protecting our country from the economic aggression of capitalist countries. Before liberation, China's customs was controlled by imperialists for a long time, and our people's economy and national welfare suffered greatly as a result. Thanks to the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, which drove away imperialism and recovered the independent management power of the customs, a major obstacle to the development of our industry for a hundred years was removed. The current customs is the people's own customs, and it has become an important tool for restoring and developing our people's economy and protecting New China's industry. At the same time, customs can collect a large amount of tariffs every year, so it is also of great significance to the state's fiscal revenue.

　　“海关”的意义
    编辑同志：
    去年一月二十七日，中央人民政府政务院颁布了《关于关税政策和海关工作的决定》。最近我又重读了一遍，但对“海关”这个名词的了解仍是模糊的。请你们代为解释一下？              
  读者  王新王新同志：
    你的问题答复如下：海关是国家在开放对外贸易口岸和准许货物、旅客出入国境的车站、机场、路口等地所设立的实际监管出入国境货物的机关。它首先要查看进出国境的货物是否已经对外贸易管理局准许输入或输出，有无禁止进口或禁止出口的；其次是根据税则对各种货物征收高低不同的关税；最后为与走私行为进行斗争；以此来保护我国不受资本主义国家的经济侵略。解放前，我国海关长期为帝国主义控制，我国人民经济和国计民生因此吃了大亏。由于中国人民大革命的伟大胜利，赶走了帝国主义，收回了海关独立自主的管理权，才扫除了一百年来我国工业不能发展的一个重大障碍。现在的海关是人民自己的海关，它已成为恢复与发展我国人民经济保护新中国工业的重要工具。同时，海关每年能收大量的关税，所以对国家的财政收入也有很大意义。
