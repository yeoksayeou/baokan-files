Shandong, Sichuan, Gansu and Other Provinces Begin Preparing to Run Winter Schools
　　In Shandong Province, the number of farmers participating in winter schools this year will increase from the current 1.6 million long-term students to 3.12 million. The province requires that by the end of the winter school next year, 400,000 students will no longer be illiterate.
　　Currently, Shandong is beginning preparations for this year's winter schools. As early as the beginning of September, the Shandong Provincial Department of Education and the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League jointly issued instructions on carrying out winter schools. Subsequently, more than 150,000 private school teachers throughout the province participated in meetings to summarize their experiences in running schools. Rural grassroots cultural and educational organizations have also been rectified. At present, various localities are selecting outstanding junior and senior elementary school graduates to serve as private school teachers. Some counties have begun to prepare houses, desks and benches, and are registering students. The Shandong Provincial Department of Education and the Provincial Cooperatives have also prepared more than 60,000 carbide lamps and 2,000 tons of carbide for rural winter schools this year.
　　This year, Shandong Province also particularly emphasizes "running schools by the cooperatives." The fact that the whole province ran schools in more than 10,000 agricultural cooperatives in the past proves that this form of learning is most popular among the masses and the learning effect is also the greatest. For example, the school run by the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in Houzaizi Village, Junan County, uses production teams as learning groups, and studies at any time during production gaps. Cultural studies have not been interrupted even during the busy farming season. (Our correspondent in Jinan)

　　Xinhua News Agency: Wenjiang and Jianyang counties in Sichuan Province have already begun to conduct investigations and research in preparation for this year's winter schools. Guanghan County is preparing to select and train winter school teachers. More than 60,000 copies of learning reference materials for training winter school teachers, compiled and printed by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education, have been successively distributed to various places. The Department of Education is compiling supplementary teaching materials such as "Rural Applied Writing" and "Rural Applied Arithmetic" according to the needs of farmers.
　　Staff members of the Education Department said: After the development of the cooperative movement, farmers' demands for learning culture are particularly urgent, so the preparations for this year's winter schools started earlier than in previous years. The winter school work plan formulated by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education stipulates that 4.5 million farmers will enter winter schools this year, which is 1.5 million more than last year. This year's winter schools will be based on agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and will be run independently or jointly by agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups. Various localities will also adopt various methods to help rural cadres and activists participate in winter schools in accordance with local conditions and time. In winter schools, farmers will receive education on the first five-year plan and the policy of agricultural cooperation.

　　This year, Gansu Province will have 480,000 farmers entering winter schools, an increase of one-third over last year. The province has recently trained 497 winter school instructors. There are 10,000 amateur teachers currently being trained.
　　In recent years, more than 54,000 farmers of all ethnic groups in Gansu Province have reached the level of junior and senior elementary school in language through spare-time study. They have played a backbone role in the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement and cultural learning. Among the more than 14,000 people in Tianshui Prefecture who participated in spare-time study, more than 1,300 served as accountants, work recorders, and amateur teachers in agricultural production cooperatives. In Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous Region, 27 winter school graduates from last year served as leaders and accountants in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Cheng Lanying, a rural woman in Gaotai County, was illiterate in the past. In 1953, she participated in the township's crash literacy class and received the first place in the class upon graduation. Last winter, she was elected as a winter school teacher in the township, and this spring she was named a model teacher in the district and received an award from the Gansu Provincial Department of Education.

### 山东、四川、甘肃等省开始准备办冬学

    山东、四川、甘肃等省开始准备办冬学 
    山东省今年参加冬学的农民，将从现有长期学习的一百六十多万人增加到三百一十二万人。该省要求到明年冬学结束时有四十万学员不再是文盲。
    现在山东各地已开始进行今年冬学的准备工作。早在九月初，山东省教育厅和中国新民主主义青年团山东省委员会就发出了关于开展冬学的联合指示。随后全省十五万多民校教师都分别参加了总结办学经验的会议。农村基层文教组织也都进行了整顿。目前各地正在物色优秀的初中、高小毕业学生充任民校教师。有些县已开始筹备房子、桌凳，并进行学员登记等工作。山东省教育厅和省合作社今年还为农村冬学准备了电石灯六万多个，电石两千吨。
    今年山东省还特别强调要“以社办学”。过去全省在一万多个农业合作社中办学的事实证明，这种学习形式最受群众欢迎，学习效果也大。如莒南县后寨子村红星农业生产合作社办的学校，以生产队为学习小组，利用生产空隙随时学习，在农忙季节也没有间断学文化。（本报驻济南记者）四川省温江、简阳等县已经开始为今年的冬学作调查研究等准备工作。广汉县正在准备选拔和训练冬学教师。四川省教育厅编印的六万多份供训练冬学教师用的学习参考资料已陆续发往各地，教育厅根据农民需要正编印“农村应用文”“农村应用算术”等补充教材。
    教育厅的工作人员说：农民在合作化运动开展后对学习文化的要求特别迫切，所以今年冬学的准备工作比历年都开始得早。四川省教育厅制定的冬学工作计划规定今年入冬学的农民将有四百五十万人，比去年多一百五十万人。今年的冬学将以农业互助合作组织为基础，由农业生产合作社和互助组单独或联合办学。各地还将因地因时制宜采用多种办法帮助乡村干部和积极分子参加冬学。在冬学中，农民们将受到关于第一个五年计划和农业合作化政策的教育。　　（新华社）
    甘肃省今年入冬学的农民将有四十八万人，比去年增加三分之一。全省最近已训练了冬学的辅导干部四百九十七人。正在训练的业余教师有一万人。
    几年来，甘肃省各族农民中已有五万四千多人经过业余学习，在语文方面达到初小、高小程度。他们在农村互助合作运动和文化学习中起了骨干作用。天水专区参加业余学习的一万四千多人中，有一千三百多人担任了农业生产合作社的会计、记工员和业余教师。张家川回族自治区有二十七名去年冬学毕业的学员担任了互助合作组织中的领导工作和会计等职务。高台县农村妇女程兰英过去一字不识，一九五三年参加乡的速成识字班，结业时得到了全班第一名的优秀成绩。去年冬季，她被推选为乡的冬学教师，今年春季又被评选为区的模范教师，得到甘肃省教育厅的奖励。（新华社）
