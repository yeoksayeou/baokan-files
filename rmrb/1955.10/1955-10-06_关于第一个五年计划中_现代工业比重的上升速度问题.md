    On the Question of the Rising Proportion of Modern Industry in the First Five-Year Plan

    Some readers have written to inquire: According to the Five-Year Plan, the total industrial output value will increase by 98.3 percent in five years, so why does the proportion of modern industry in the total industrial and agricultural output value only increase by 9.3 percent (from 26.7 percent in 1952 to 36 percent in 1957)? The Study Committee of the Shishou County Company of China National General Merchandise Company in Hubei Province also asked: The proportion of modern industry in the total industrial and agricultural output value reached 30 percent in 1953, an increase of 3.3 percent compared to 26.7 percent in 1952; in 1954, it reached 33 percent, another increase of 3 percent; why did it only increase by 3 percent in the subsequent three years, reaching only 36 percent in 1957?

    Readers' concern about this issue is understandable. In the past, the foundation of modern industry in our country was very weak. In 1949, the output value of industries using machinery only accounted for about 17 percent of the total industrial and agricultural output value. Now, the people of the whole country are working hard to realize the country's socialist industrialization, and the ability of modern industry to fully lead the entire national economy and occupy an absolute advantage in the total industrial and agricultural output value is an important symbol of socialist industrialization. Therefore, the rate of increase in the proportion of modern industry cannot but arouse people's deep concern.

    To answer this question, we should understand that the content of the rate of increase in the proportion of modern industry is different from the rate of increase in industrial output value. The rate of increase in the proportion of modern industry depends not only on the growth of modern industry itself, but also on the growth of the total industrial and agricultural output value. To build socialism, while developing industry—especially heavy industry—we must also develop agriculture and handicrafts accordingly. Therefore, in the total industrial and agricultural output value, in addition to the total industrial output value, the total agricultural output value and the total handicraft output value are also constantly increasing; that is to say, the increase in the proportion of modern industry is achieved under the condition that all parts of the total industrial and agricultural output value are constantly increasing. It is impossible for us to imagine that the increase in the proportion of modern industry would have the same speed as the increase in the output value of modern industry itself. The rate of increase in the proportion of modern industry stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan should be said to be very fast. This will bring about a fairly important change in the position of modern industry in the entire national economy and lay a preliminary foundation for our country's socialist industrialization.

    Why is the rate of increase in the proportion of modern industry slower in the last three years than in the first two years? First of all, let's look at the growth of the total industrial output value itself and the growth of other parts of the total industrial and agricultural output value—especially the total agricultural output value. We know that the speed of industrial development is faster in the recovery period than in the construction period. Although the recovery period of our national economy ended in 1952, industrial production still had some characteristics of the recovery period in the first two years of the First Five-Year Plan, and the potential of existing enterprises was still great. Therefore, the growth of the total industrial output value was also relatively fast. In the first two years, the industrial production plans were overfulfilled, and the industrial output value increased by 53.7 percent in two years, an average annual increase of 24 percent, greatly exceeding the average annual increase of 14.7 percent stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. In terms of agricultural production, due to the spring drought and autumn floods in many regions in 1953 and the floods encountered in many regions in 1954, the plans for both years were not completed. In this way, the rate of increase in the proportion of modern industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value was of course relatively rapid. The situation was different in the last three years. The growth rate of industrial production could not be as fast as in the first two years. The total industrial output value will increase by 29 percent in the three years. Because agricultural production needs to make up for the past deficiencies, the growth rate needs to be faster than in the first two years; if 1954 is taken as the base year, grain output will increase by 13.7 percent in the three years, and cotton output will increase by 53.5 percent. In this way, the rate of increase in the proportion of modern industrial output value will naturally be slower than in the first three years.

    Secondly, we cannot ignore the relationship between percentages and absolute figures. As the absolute figures of the total industrial and agricultural output value increase year by year, the absolute figure represented by each percentage point increase in the proportion of modern industry also increases year by year. This cannot but have a certain impact on the annual growth rate of the proportion of modern industry.

    Finally, it must also be pointed out that the above-mentioned increases in the proportion of modern industrial output value in 1953 and 1954 are the actual results of implementation; while the figure for 1957 is a planned figure. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the people of the whole country are striving to complete and over fulfill the First Five-Year Plan. The annual plans for the first two years of the First Five-Year Plan have been successfully realized; and the industrial production plan has been overfulfilled even more. In the next three years, the people of the whole country, especially the vast number of workers and staff of industrial enterprises, will redouble their efforts to complete the state plan. By 1957, the proportion of modern industry is likely to be greater than the percentage stipulated in the plan.

### 关于第一个五年计划中  现代工业比重的上升速度问题

    关于第一个五年计划中
    现代工业比重的上升速度问题
    有些读者来信询问：根据五年计划规定，五年内工业总产值增长百分之九十八点三，为什么现代工业在工农业总产值中的比重只上升百分之九点三（由一九五二年的百分之二十六点七上升为一九五七年的百分之三十六）？中国百货公司湖北省石首县公司学习委员会还提出：现代工业在工农业总产值中的比重，一九五三年达到百分之三十，比一九五二年的百分之二十六点七上升了百分之三点三；一九五四年达到百分之三十三，又上升百分之三；为什么以后的三年中只上升百分之三，到一九五七年才达到百分之三十六呢？
    读者对这个问题的关心是可以理解的。我国过去现代工业的基础十分薄弱，在一九四九年使用机器的工业产值只占工农业总产值的百分之十七左右；现在全国人民正在为实现国家的社会主义工业化而努力，而现代工业能够完全领导整个国民经济并在工农业总产值中占绝对优势，正是社会主义工业化的重要标志之一。因此，现代工业比重的上升速度问题，不能不引起人们的深切关怀。
    为了答复这个问题，我们应该了解现代工业比重的上升速度和工业产值的增长速度所含的内容是不同的。现代工业比重的上升速度，不仅取决于现代工业本身的增长情况，而且也取决于工农业总产值的增长情况。我们要建设社会主义，在发展工业——首先是重工业的同时，还必须相应地发展农业和手工业。因此在工农业总产值中，除了工业总产值以外，农业总产值和手工业总产值也是在不断增长着的；这就是说，现代工业比重的上升，是在工农业总产值中各个部分都不断增长的情况下取得的。我们就不可能设想现代工业比重的上升同现代工业本身产值的上升有同样的速度。第一个五年计划中规定的现代工业比重的上升速度，应该说是很快的。这将使现代工业在整个国民经济中的地位发生相当重要的变化，而打下我国的社会主义工业化的初步基础。
    为什么现代工业比重的上升速度，后三年不如前两年呢？首先，我们从工业总产值本身的增长和工农业总产值中其它部分——特别是农业总产值的增长两方面的情况来看。我们知道，工业发展速度在恢复时期要比建设时期为快，我国国民经济的恢复时期虽然在一九五二年结束了，但是在第一个五年计划的头两年，工业生产带有一部分恢复时期的性质，原有企业的潜力还很大，因此工业总产值的增长也是较快的。在头两个年度，工业生产计划都超额完成了，工业产值两年中增长百分之五十三点七，平均每年增加百分之二十四，大大超过五年计划规定平均每年递增百分之十四点七的速度。而农业生产方面，由于一九五三年许多地区的春旱秋涝和一九五四年许多地区遇到了水灾，影响到两年的计划都没有完成。这样，现代工业产值在工农业总产值比重的上升速度当然就比较迅速。在后三年情况就有所不同。工业生产的增长速度不可能像头两年这末快了，三年中工业总产值共将增长百分之二十九。农业生产由于要弥补过去的不足，增长速度就需要比前两年为快；如果以一九五四年为基数，三年中粮食产量要增长百分之十三点七，棉花产量要增长百分之五十三点五。这样，现代工业产值的比重的上升速度也自然要比前三年慢一些。
    其次，我们还不能忽略百分比和绝对数字的关系问题。随着工农业总产值绝对数字的逐年加大，现代工业所占的比重每上升一个百分数所代表的绝对数字也逐年加大了。这不能不使现代工业比重的逐年增长率受到一定影响。
    最后，还必须指出：上面提到的一九五三年和一九五四年现代工业产值的比重的上升情况，都是实际执行的结果；而一九五七年的却是计划数字。在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，全国人民正在为完成和超额完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。第一个五年计划前两年的年度计划已经胜利地实现了；而工业生产计划更是超额完成了。在今后三年，全国人民，特别是工业企业的广大职工，必将加倍努力地来完成国家计划。到一九五七年，现代工业的比重，是有可能大于计划规定的百分数的。
