What is Standardized Chinese?
Ye Shengtao

Standardized Chinese – this term is not yet universally familiar. I would like to explain in simple terms what Standardized Chinese is.

First, let's talk about "standardization." This means setting a standard. Take, for example, the Chinese character simplification plan discussed at the recent National Conference on Language Reform. The Chinese character simplification plan selected some simplified characters. After these simplified characters are approved and published, they will serve as the standard and be used consistently in printed materials. Anyone who requires written characters to conform to the standard must write them according to the published forms. The Chinese character simplification plan sets a standard for simplified characters, and this is called standardization.

Now, let's talk about "Standardized Chinese." Chinese is the language of the Han people. Throughout history, phonologists, etymologists, philologists, and modern linguists have all proven that Chinese is a unified whole, used jointly by the Han people. Although the population is large and the area is vast, the situation of dialectal divergence is quite complex, the divergence, separation and changes never exceed the scope of the entire Chinese system. A person who lives in his hometown and interacts only with local people can use dialect enough to communicate ideas and coordinate joint work in all activities. If a person from another place comes, and the difference between their dialects is relatively large, or if they go to another place where the dialectal difference is relatively large, the dialect will not work. There are only two ways to solve this. One way is to learn the dialect of the person who comes, or to learn the dialect of the place you arrive in. The other way is for both parties to not use dialect, but to use a common language to exchange ideas and coordinate joint work in all activities. The proposed Standardized Chinese is the second method. By using one language as the standard, learning it together, and using it together, it will work no matter what kind of people you meet or where you go. You will be able to communicate with each other, heart to heart, without any obstacles. Standardized Chinese aims to achieve this.

For a long time, this common language has gradually formed, and that is Mandarin. Is it not the general case that you speak the dialect you learned from childhood with the local people in your hometown, and when you meet people from other places or go to other places, you speak Mandarin? Of course, those who have not learned Mandarin cannot speak it. As long as you know a little, you should try to speak it, even if it's forced. No one wants their words to be misunderstood, and everyone wants the listener to understand what they are saying. This is a natural requirement in social life.

Due to practical needs, people learn Mandarin, but their achievements are not the same. Some people learn it well and speak quite standardly, while others learn it poorly and may only be able to manage to cope with it throughout their lives. Everyone's learning is spontaneous, and there are no training classes or lectures to sign up for, so it is natural that the levels are uneven. In other words, both those who speak well and those who speak poorly all believe they are speaking Mandarin, but in reality, there are great differences. This gives people the impression that Mandarin is a language that is a hodgepodge of southern and northern accents, a language that is not based on any dialect. This view is not correct. Linguists tell us, based on a series of historical facts, that the formation of Mandarin is based on Northern dialects.

Currently, the people of the whole country are working together to build a great socialist cause. The need for a common language has never been so urgent as it is now. Everyone can cite a long list of examples of how language barriers hinder work, so I won't repeat them. Just think, language barriers hinder work, and work, no matter which item, is a link in the great chain of the entire cause. Can we allow language barriers to continue to exist? No, of course not. The need for a common language stems from this meaning, and we must clearly recognize this. With this understanding, we know that the dialects of place A or place B are not qualified to be the common language. Mandarin, because it was gradually formed over a long period of time and the people who use it speak it with differences, also needs to be further standardized in order to become a common language that meets current needs. Therefore, we can say that Standardized Chinese is the standardization of Mandarin. To set some standards for Mandarin, learn it together, and use it together to achieve results that are beneficial to the great cause: this is the task and purpose of the work of Standardized Chinese.

Any language has three aspects: phonetics, vocabulary, and grammar. As a common language, what pronunciation should Mandarin use as the standard?

Speaking of this, we must mention the divergence of Chinese dialects, which is most severe in terms of phonetics. The same words written on paper can be understood by people everywhere, but if two people with relatively large differences in pronunciation read them out in their own dialects, they may not understand each other much, or even not at all. We have plenty of this experience. Therefore, if you don't want a common language, so be it. If you want a common language, you must have a standard pronunciation. You must speak to each other in standard pronunciation so that you can understand each other.

The standard pronunciation cannot be created artificially, needless to say. Nor can it be pieced together. If "tian" (sky) is pronounced in Xi'an pronunciation, "qian" (money) in Guangzhou pronunciation, "yu" (fish) in Suzhou pronunciation, and "yu" (rain) in Kunming pronunciation, such piecing together would be too troublesome. Even if you were not afraid of the trouble of piecing it together, who would understand this pronunciation? Moreover, who would be invited to be the teacher to demonstrate? In fact, piecing together is also creating artificially.

Therefore, the standard pronunciation must be the pronunciation of one place, and the pronunciation of one place must be adopted as a whole. In one place, "tian" (sky), "qian" (money), "yu" (fish), and "yu" (rain) are all pronounced in a certain way, and there is a system to it. It is convenient to learn and speak entirely according to its system.

People who speak Mandarin have always learned Beijing pronunciation. Whether they learn it accurately or not is another matter. In short, this method is in line with the principle of using the pronunciation of one place as the standard pronunciation. Why didn't we learn the pronunciation of Tianjin or Baoding, but learned the pronunciation of Beijing? Of course, it was due to various political, economic, and cultural relationships. Now we want to set a standard pronunciation, and we cannot violate the principle of using the pronunciation of one place as the standard pronunciation. Then, which place should it be? It's still Beijing. The people of the whole country yearn for Beijing. When they mention Tiananmen and Chairman Mao, everyone's eyes light up. Beijing has never attracted the hearts of the people of the whole country as it does now. Shouldn't Beijing pronunciation be set as our standard pronunciation? Moreover, speaking Mandarin has always used Beijing pronunciation, and it is the most convenient thing to inherit.

Speaking of this, it can be seen that using Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation is not a new thing, but a confirmation of an established fact. In the sense of standardization, it is only pointing out a clear goal, hoping that everyone will work hard to learn Beijing pronunciation, learn it according to effective methods, and gradually achieve accuracy and proficiency in language practice – being proficient and accurate in both listening to others and speaking yourself. That's all.

In addition to using phonetic symbols, it is best to be able to learn a pronunciation through oral instruction. The teacher utters the accurate sound, and the learner listens and learns to utter it. At first, it is not accurate or proficient, but later the ability to listen is strengthened, and the mouth's activity can adapt, gradually achieving accuracy and proficiency. This period of effort is called pronunciation correction. We have pronunciation correction classes when we learn any foreign language. Now, people everywhere have to learn Beijing pronunciation, and they also have to correct their pronunciation well. People who spoke Mandarin in the past have not received formal pronunciation correction training. If the language environment is good and they are willing to practice hard, their pronunciation is quite standard. If the language environment is not good and they are not willing to use their minds, but just learn it vaguely, then they may be far from the standard, but they also think that this is Beijing pronunciation. In the future, if everyone corrects their pronunciation seriously, there will be no such uneven situation.

The difference between the dialect of one place and Beijing pronunciation is not without rules. For example, according to the Suzhou dialect, the sounds of "an" (peace), "han" (cold), "kan" (look), and "gan" (dry) are different from the sounds of "an" (peace), "han" (cold), "kan" (look), and "gan" (dry) in Beijing pronunciation. The difference lies in the lower half of each sound. The "an" in Suzhou and the "an" in Beijing, the "han" in Suzhou and the "han" in Beijing… The different situations of pairs of sounds are consistent. This is a rule. If Suzhou people master this rule, as long as they learn a few Beijing pronunciations in this type of sound—for example, the few mentioned above—similar sounds—for example, "huan" (joy), "pan" (plate), "luan" (chaos), "man" (full)—can be inferred by analogy without error. Mastering the rules saves a lot of trouble, and you don't have to memorize and practice each sound to death.

In terms of the dialect of one place, there is more than one rule similar to what was said earlier. In terms of the dialects of various places, the situations of difference from Beijing pronunciation are not consistent with each other. In this view, mastering the rules seems to be a very troublesome thing. Actually, it is not. Suzhou people and people familiar with Suzhou can prove that it is not difficult for Suzhou people to change the sounds of "an" (peace), "han" (cold), and similar sounds into Beijing pronunciation. The rule mentioned earlier will naturally be comprehended in language practice. The situation is the same in other places. Moreover, people who study pronunciation are finding these rules, and people who teach pronunciation are bound to teach these rules. Therefore, it is not difficult for people in any place to learn Beijing pronunciation and master these rules.

Just pronouncing the sounds accurately is not necessarily Mandarin. For example, if Suzhou people pronounce "ge da" (here) and "gui da" (there) in Beijing pronunciation extremely accurately, people in other places will not understand, and Suzhou people will not understand either. This is a matter of vocabulary. "Ge da" and "gui da" are Suzhou dialect words, not Mandarin words, so pronouncing Beijing pronunciation accurately is useless. If Suzhou people want to speak Mandarin, they must say "zheli" (here) and "nali" (there) in Beijing pronunciation to succeed.

Also, "daifu" (doctor) is a Beijing dialect word, and "langzhong" (doctor) is a Suzhou dialect word (both words refer to doctors). If you say "daifu" or "langzhong" to people in other places, they won't know what it is, but if you say "yisheng" (doctor), everyone will understand. It can be seen that "yisheng" (doctor) is the Mandarin word. In terms of Chinese vocabulary, there are quite a few such situations. Now that we want to talk about standardization, it is best to use only Mandarin words in both speaking and writing. If there is a relatively complete dictionary, which words are Mandarin words and which words are dialect words are all noted at the top based on the results of meticulous research, that would be very convenient. Unfortunately, there is no such dictionary now. It doesn't matter if there is no such dictionary, because when we speak and write, we are consciously or unconsciously doing the work of distinguishing and selecting. As long as the unconscious becomes conscious, and the conscious becomes more conscious, it will promote the process of standardization. Everyone's distinction and selection lays the foundation for lexicographers, and it will be easier for them to obtain meticulous results in their research. The dictionaries they compile can become relatively accurate standards.

Dialect words can also be transformed into Mandarin words. For example, there is a word in the dialect of a certain place that has good expressive power, and people everywhere like to use it, especially people who write general articles and literary works like to use it, then it is qualified to be transformed into a Mandarin word. Not only dialect words are like this, but also classical Chinese words and foreign words are the same. Mandarin vocabulary is enriched under such circumstances.

There is another situation, which is not a problem of the difference between dialect and Mandarin. Due to not paying attention when using words and using them casually, this creates confusion in the use of words. Now that we want to talk about standardization, this situation must be corrected. Regularly consulting a dictionary is one way to correct it, but what is especially important is that everyone consciously discerns the meaning of each word in language practice, what occasions it can be used in, and what occasions it cannot be used in, carefully discerns them, and then uses them appropriately. Isn't this very troublesome? It's certainly a bit troublesome, but for the sake of Standardized Chinese and for the sake of accurately expressing one's thoughts, no one should be afraid of this trouble.

Now let's talk about the grammatical aspect. According to grammarians, the grammatical differences between the dialects of various places and between dialect and Mandarin are not large. Of course, there are minor differences. For example, Mandarin says "yao chifan ma?" (Do you want to eat?) and "yao kanxi ma?" (Do you want to watch a show?), while Suzhou people say "a yao chifan?" and "a yao kanxi?" This is a grammatical difference. However, when Suzhou people speak Mandarin, they will never just pronounce "a yao chifan?" and "a yao kanxi?" in Beijing pronunciation, they will definitely change the "a yao..." format to the "yao...ma?" format. Because learning Beijing pronunciation cannot be separated from language practice and learned in isolation. While learning Beijing pronunciation, Suzhou people also learn the "yao...ma?" format.

So what is the problem in the grammatical aspect? It is to find out the rules of Chinese grammar, clearly and concisely explain these rules, and enable the masses who can originally use grammar (if they cannot use grammar, no one will understand what they say) to consciously master these rules, to know not only how it is, but also why it is. In other words, what is needed is a grammar book that conforms to the actual situation of Chinese, as a standard for everyone to learn grammar. This is the urgently needed standardization work in the grammatical aspect. Grammarians will surely be able to complete this task as soon as possible in order to meet the requirements of the masses.

At this point, all aspects of what is called Standardized Chinese have been roughly explained.

The work of Standardized Chinese is by no means a matter of one morning or evening, nor is it a matter of three or five years. However, everyone uses language, and everyone has a close relationship with this matter. As long as everyone understands the great significance of needing a common language, the work of Standardized Chinese will surely be completed within a not too long period of time.

    什么叫汉语规范化
    叶圣陶
    汉语规范化，这个话还没有普遍熟悉。我想浅显地说一说什么叫汉语规范化。
    先说规范化。这就是定个标准的意思。就拿最近召开的全国文字改革会议中讨论的汉字简化方案做例子。汉字简化方案选了些简化字，这些简化字通过和公布以后，就作为标准，在印刷物上一致使用。无论是谁，只要他要求写下来的字合乎标准，就得照公布的字体写。汉字简化方案为简化字定个标准，这样就叫规范化。
    再说汉语规范化。汉语是汉族人民的语言。历来的音韵学家、训诂学家、文字学家，现代的语言学家，都证明汉语是个整体，为汉族人民所共同使用。只因人口众多，居住地区广阔，方言分歧的情形相当复杂，可是，分歧尽管分歧，离合变化决不超出汉语整个体系的范围。一个人住在本乡本土，交往的全是些本地人，使用方言尽够跟人家交流思想，在一切活动中调整共同工作了。要是来一个别地的人，彼此方言的差别比较大，或者到方言的差别比较大的别地去，方言就不济事了。这只有两个办法解决。一个办法是学会来的那个人的方言，学会所到的那个地方的方言。另一个办法是彼此不用方言，使用一种共同的语言来交流思想，在一切活动中调整共同工作。现在提出的汉语规范化就是后
  一个办法。以一种语言为标准，共同学会它，共同使用它，那就碰到什么地方的人都成，到什么地方去都成，一边说，一边听，心心相通，毫无阻碍。汉语规范化就是要做到这样。
    很久以来，这种共同语已经逐渐形成，就是普通话。跟本地人，在本乡本土，说从小学会的方言，碰到别地的人，到了别地，就说普通话，这不是一般的情形吗？当然，没学过普通话的没法说，只要有点儿会，就是勉强也要说一说。谁说话都不肯出门不认货，说出去总望听话的对方了解，这是社会生活中的必然要求。
    由于实际需要而学普通话，各人的成绩并不一样。有的人学得好，说出来很够标准，有的人学得差，也许一辈子只能勉强对付。大家的学习是自发的，又没有训练班讲习班之类可以报名参加，程度参差不齐是当然的。换句话说，说得好的，说得差的，都自以为说的普通话，实际上却大有出入。这就使人们有这么一种观念，以为普通话是一种南腔北调七拼八凑的语言，是一种没有什么方言做基础的语言。这种观念并不正确。语言学家根据一连串的历史事实告诉我们，普通话的形成是以北方话为基础的。
    目前全国人民正在齐心协力做建设社会主义的大事业。对共同语的需要，自古以来，再没有目前这样迫切了。由于语言的障碍而妨害工作的事例，谁都举得出一大串，我不再说。只要想一想，语言的障碍妨害着工作，而工作呢，无论哪一项全是一环套一环的大事业中的一环，试问语言的障碍还能让它存在吗？不能，当然不能。对共同语的需要是从这样的意义上出发的，我们必须明确地认识。有了这样的认识，就知道甲地或乙地的方言固然没资格做共同语，就是普通话，因为它是长时期中逐渐形成的，使用它的人说起来又彼此有出入，也还要进一步规范化才能成为切合目前需要的共同语。因此，我们可以说，汉语规范化就是普通话的规范化。给普通话定些标准，共同学会它，共同使用它，收到有利于大事业的效果：这就是汉语规范化这项工作的任务和目的。
    任何语言都有语音、词汇、语法三个方面。普通话作为共同语，以什么语音为标准呢？
    说到这里，必须提到汉语方言的分歧，语音方面最厉害。同样一番话，用汉字写在纸上，各地的人都看得懂，可是，方音差别比较大的两个人各用自己的方音念出来，就可能彼此不大明白，甚至完全不懂。这种经验我们有的是。可见不要共同语便罢，你要共同语，就非有标准音不可。彼此用标准音说出来，才能彼此听明白。
    标准音不能凭人工创造，这不用说。也不能拼凑。要是“天”用西安语音，“钱”用广州语音，“鱼”用苏州语音，“雨”用昆明语音，这样拼凑太麻烦了。就是不怕麻烦拼凑起来，这套语音谁听得懂？而且，请谁来当教师示范呢？其实拼凑也就是凭人工创造。
    因此，标准音必须是一个地方的语音，采用某
  一个地方的语音就得整套采用。在一个地方，“天”怎么说，“钱”就怎么说，“鱼”怎么说，“雨”就怎么说，这里头是有系统的，完全按照它的系统，学起来说起来都方便。
    说普通话的人向来都学北京语音，学得准确不准确是另一回事，总之，这个办法是合乎以一个地方的语音为标准音的原则的。当初为什么不学天津或是保定的语音而学北京语音，当然由于政治上经济上文化上的种种关系。我们现在要定一种标准音，不能违反以一个地方的语音为标准音的原则。那末，哪处地方呢？还是北京。全国人民心心向往北京，提起天安门，提起毛主席，谁的眼前都发亮，北京从来没有像现在这样吸引全国人民的心，北京语音不该定为我们的标准音吗？何况向来说普通话就用北京语音，继承下来，是最为顺当的事情。
    说到这里，可见以北京语音为标准音并不是新事情，而是肯定既成事实。就规范化的意义上说，只是指出个明确的目标，希望大家努力学会北京语音，要按有效的方法学，在语言实践中逐渐达到准确和熟练——听人家说，自己口头说，都熟练，都准确，如此而已。
    学一种语音，除了利用标音符号以外，最好能够口耳授受。教的人发出准确的音，学的人听了，学着发，起初不准确，不熟练，后来听的能力加强，口的活动能够适应，逐渐达到准确和熟练。这一段工夫叫正音。我们学任何外国语，都有正音课。现在各地的人要学会北京语音，也得好好地正音。以前各地说普通话的人没受过正规的正音训练。语言环境好，自己又肯用心练习的，他的发音很够标准。语言环境不好，自己又不肯用心，只是依稀仿佛地学一学的，那就可能距离标准很远，可是他也自以为这就是北京语音。今后大家认真正音，就不会有这种参差不齐的情形了。
    一个地方的方音跟北京语音的差别并不是漫无规律的。譬如按苏州的方音，“安”“寒”“看”“干”一类音跟北京语音中的“安”“寒”“看”“干”一类音不同，不同在各个音的下半截。苏州的“安”跟北京的“安”，苏州的“寒”跟北京的“寒”……一对一对的音的不同情形是一致的。这就是一条规律。苏州人掌握了这条规律，只要在这一类音里学会几个北京语音——例如前边举出的几个，同类的音——例如“欢”“盘”“乱”“满”就可以类推，不致错误。掌握了规律就省事得多，用不着一个音一个音死记死练了。
    就一个地方的方音说，类似前边所说的规律不止一条。就各地的方音说，跟北京语音差别的情形，彼此并不一致。这样看来，掌握规律似乎是很麻烦的事。其实不然。苏州人和熟悉苏州的人都可以证明：苏州人要把“安”“寒”一类音改成北京语音是并不困难的，前边所说的那条规律是自然而然会在语言实践中领会的。其他地方情形也如此。何况研究语音的人在找出这些规律，教语音的人又必然教这些规律，因而任何地方的人学习北京语音，都不难掌握这些规律。
    光是发音发准了，还不一定就是普通话。譬如苏州人把“格搭”（这里）“归搭”（那里）按北京语音发音发得极端准确，但是别地的人听不懂，苏州人也听不懂。这是词汇的问题。“格搭”“归搭”是苏州方言的词，不是普通话的词，所以发准了北京语音也不济事。苏州人要说普通话，必须按北京语音说“这里”“那里”才成。
    又如“大夫”，是北京方言的词，“郎中”，是苏州方言的词（这两个词都指医生），对其他地方的人说“大夫”，说“郎中”，他们不知道是什么，可是说“医生”大家都懂，可见“医生”才是普通话的词。就汉语的词汇方面说，这样的情形很不少。现在要讲规范化，无论说话写文章，最好全用普通话的词。要是有一本比较完备的词典，哪些词是普通话的词，哪些词是方言的词，都根据精密研究的结果注在上头，那就很方便。可惜现在还没有这样的词典。没有这样的词典不要紧，因为我们说话写文章，或是自觉或是不自觉，也在那里做辨别和选择的工夫，只要不自觉的变为自觉，自觉的更加自觉，就促进了规范化的过程。大家的辨别和选择为词典家打下基础，词典家研究起来就比较容易得到精密的结果，他们编成的词典就可以成为比较确切的标准。
    方言的词也可以转化成普通话的词。譬如某地的方言里有一个词，它有很好的表达力量，各地的人都喜欢使用它，尤其是写一般文章和文学作品的人都喜欢使用它，它就有资格转化成普通话的词。岂但方言的词如此，文言的词和外来的词也一样。普通话的词汇就是在这样的情形之下丰富起来的。
    还有一种情形，那并不是方言跟普通话差别的问题。由于用词的时候不注意，随便用，这就造成用词的混乱。现在要讲规范化，这种情形非纠正不可。经常查词典是一个纠正的办法，可是尤其重要的是大家在语言实践中自觉地辨明每一个词的意义，它可以用在什么场合，它不能用在什么场合，都仔细辨明，然后恰当地使用它。这样，不是很麻烦吗？麻烦当然有点儿麻烦，可是为了汉语规范化，为了把自己的思想确切地表达出来，谁都不应该怕这个麻烦。
    现在再说语法方面。据语法学家说，各地的方言之间，方言跟普通话之间，语法的差别并不大。微小的差别当然有，譬如普通话说“要吃饭吗？”“要看戏吗？”苏州人说“阿要吃饭？”“阿要看戏？”这就是语法的差别。可是苏州人说普通话，决不会把“阿要吃饭？”“阿要看戏？”发了北京语音就算，一定会把“阿要……”的格式改成“要……吗”的格式。因为学北京语音不能脱离了语言实践孤立地学，在学北京语音的同时，苏州人也把“要……吗”的格式学会了。
    那末语法方面的问题是什么呢？找出汉语语法的规律，明确地简要地说明这些规律，使本来能够运用语法的群众（要是不能运用语法，说出来的话就没人能懂）自觉地掌握这些规律，知其然，又知其所以然。换句话说，就是需要一本切合汉语实际的语法书，作为大家学习语法的标准。这是语法方面急需的规范化的工作。语法学家为满足群众的要求，一定能够从早完成这个任务。
    到这里，什么叫汉语规范化的各方面大致都说了。
    汉语规范化决不是一朝一夕的事，也不是三年五载的事。可是，谁都使用语言，谁都跟这件事有密切关系，只要大家明白我们需要一种共同语的重大意义，汉语规范化的工作一定会在不太长的时期内完成。
