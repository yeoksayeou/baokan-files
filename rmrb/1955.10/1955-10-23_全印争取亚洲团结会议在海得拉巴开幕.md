Xinhua News Agency, Hyderabad, October 22nd: The All-India Conference for Asian Solidarity opened in Hyderabad city on the 21st. More than 1,000 delegates attended the conference, including Indian Members of Parliament, writers, artists, doctors, scientists, legal workers, trade unionists, and prominent figures from all walks of life. In addition, 2,000 citizens also participated in the opening ceremony. The purpose of this conference is to express support for the Indian government's diplomatic policy of striving for world peace, to express the views of the Indian people on unresolved world issues, and to endorse and promote the resolutions of the Asian countries conference held in Delhi in April of this year.

    On the rostrum hung a banner that read "Long Live Asian Solidarity for Peace," with large posters written in Hindi and English of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence on both sides of the banner.

    On the rostrum were prominent Indian peace figures: Dr. Kitchlew, Mulk Raj Anand, Member of Parliament Amar Singh Sehgal, Member of Parliament Ravi Narayan Reddy, and former Hyderabad State Minister Dewan Bahadur Armuda Ayyangar.

    The conference received congratulatory telegrams wishing the conference success from the governors of West Bengal and Madras provinces, the chief ministers of Rajasthan and Saurashtra states, the speaker of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly, and all members of the Delhi State Legislative Assembly, as well as other individuals.

    Since Mrs. Rameshwarī Nehru, Chairman of the Indian Committee for Asian Solidarity, was unable to attend due to illness, the conference was presided over by Member of Parliament Syed Nauser Ali, Secretary-General of the Indian Committee for Asian Solidarity.

    The former Mayor of Hyderabad, prominent social worker M. Hanumantha Rao, delivered the opening speech, calling on the people of India and Asia to be vigilant against the struggling actions taken by warmongers to keep tensions permanent. He said that the people of Asia, who have only recently been liberated from the grip of imperialism, are determined to use the weapon of the Five Principles to combat the conspiracies of the warmongers, as they demonstrated at the Bandung Afro-Asian Conference. He also said that the imperialist strategy of Asians fighting Asians will not succeed.

    Indian Member of Parliament Anup Singh read Mrs. Rameshwarī Nehru's presidential address.

    Mrs. Rameshwarī Nehru spoke about the current international situation and its impact on the political, economic, scientific, cultural, and social lives of people in all countries. She drew particular attention to the Bandung Conference, the Geneva Four-Power Conference, progress in efforts towards disarmament, the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, and the negotiations between China and the United States to ease tensions.

    At the same time, she pointed out the problems in Asia that remain unresolved. She spoke of conspiracies to undermine the armistice agreements in Indochina and Korea, the increasing tensions in the Middle East, the increasing arrogance of colonialism and racism in Africa, the continued Portuguese occupation of Indian territory, the issue of returning Taiwan to the People's Republic of China, China's legitimate status in the United Nations, and the issue of restoring Japan's sovereignty. She said that Indian Prime Minister Nehru's suggestion in July to convene a "Geneva-style conference" to discuss the Far East issue "would greatly help to resolve the urgent problems of Asia and end foreign control and interference in Asia's internal affairs. Such a conference would further consolidate and expand the peace zone."

    G. S. Melkote, Minister of Public Works of the Hyderabad State Government, and Bhagavantam, Vice-Chancellor of Osmania University of Hyderabad, both expressed their support for the purpose of the conference in their speeches. Member of Parliament and Secretary of the Indian Committee for Asian Solidarity, Choitram Gidwani, demanded the immediate restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate status in the United Nations and the return of Taiwan to China in order to ensure peace and security in Asia. At this point, delegates and citizens cheered enthusiastically in agreement.

    The delegates unanimously decided to send a telegram to Indian Prime Minister Nehru, expressing their deep gratitude for his efforts to promote world peace and ease tensions.

    主席台上挂着“争取和平的亚洲团结万岁”的旗帜，旗帜两边挂着用印地文和英文写的和平共处五项原则的大幅标语。
    在主席台上的是印度著名的和平人士：克其鲁博士、穆尔克·拉志·阿南德、国会议员阿马尔·辛格·西格尔、国会议员拉维·纳拉扬·雷迪和前海得拉巴邦部长德万·巴哈杜尔·阿慕达·艾扬加尔。

    由于印度争取亚洲团结委员会主席拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人因病没有出席，会议由国会议员、印度争取亚洲团结委员会秘书长赛义德·纳乌塞尔·阿里主持。
    前海得拉巴市长、著名的社会工作者麦·哈努曼塔·拉奥致开幕词，他号召印度和亚洲人民对战争贩子设法使紧张局势永远存在下去而采取的挣扎行动要提高警惕。他说，最近才从帝国主义掌握中解放出来的亚洲人民就像他们在万隆亚非会议上所证明的那样，决心要以五项原则的武器对抗战争贩子的阴谋。他又说，帝国主义的以亚洲人打亚洲人的策略不会得到成功。
    印度国会议员阿努普·辛格宣读了拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人的主席致词。
    拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人谈到了今天的国际局势和它对世界各国人民的政治、经济、科学、文化和社会生活的影响。她提请人们特别注意万隆会议，日内瓦四大国会议，为裁军而作的努力的进展，和平利用原子能国际会议，以及中国和美国为缓和紧张局势而进行的谈判。
    同时，她又指出了在亚洲的仍然没有得到解决的问题，她谈到企图破坏印度支那和朝鲜停战协定的阴谋，中东的日益紧张的局势，殖民主义和种族主义在非洲的日益嚣张的情况，葡萄牙继续占领印度领土的问题，把台湾归还中华人民共和国的问题，中国在联合国中的合法地位，以及恢复日本主权的问题。她说，印度总理尼赫鲁在今年七月间建议召开的讨论远东问题的“日内瓦式会议，将大大有助于解决亚洲的迫切问题和结束外国对亚洲内部事务的控制和干涉。这种会议将进一步巩固和扩大和平地区。”
    海得拉巴邦政府公共工程部部长格·斯·麦尔科特和海得拉巴奥斯曼尼亚大学副校长巴格万塔姆在发言时都表示支持会议的目的。国会议员、印度争取亚洲团结委员会秘书乔伊特兰·吉德瓦尼要求立即恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位和把台湾归还中国，以确保亚洲的和平和安全。这时，代表们和市民们热烈欢呼表示赞同。
