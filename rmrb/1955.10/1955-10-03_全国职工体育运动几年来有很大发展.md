On the eve of the opening of the First National Workers' Games, the person in charge of the Games introduced to Xinhua News Agency reporters the development of sports activities among workers in our country in recent years. The person in charge said that according to statistics from eighteen cities including Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenyang, and the railway system, more than 1.1 million workers regularly participate in sports activities, and there are more than 34,000 various teams. Taking this Games as an example, the more than 1,700 male and female athletes participating in the competition were selected from more than one million worker-athletes from fifteen industrial units and the education and People's Bank systems. At present, calisthenics (work interval exercises) have become a regular sports activity for workers. In general government offices, factories, and mines, about 50% of workers regularly do the exercises.

The number of sports venues and equipment in various places is also increasing rapidly. In Shenyang alone, there are now more than 1,270 basketball, volleyball, and soccer fields, and more than 2,600 sets of single bars, parallel bars, and vaulting horses, which is four times more than in 1950. At the first national conference on workers' sports work in November 1954, it was also decided to allocate 5% to 7.5% of all trade union funds as sports funds for workers.

The development of sports activities has played a positive role in improving the health of workers and increasing production. A survey of eight workshops at the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory in August 1954 showed that the attendance rate of athletes reached 100%. At the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, during the red banner competition and award ceremony, 93% of the members of the factory's soccer and volleyball teams received awards.

With the development of sports activities, a large number of sports activists and sports experts have emerged among the workers. At the Second Beijing Workers' Sports Games in 1954, 23 of the 38 events broke the records of the previous games. Liu Chengbang, a Javelin athlete and railway worker from Jinan, has broken the national record several times. Liu Erzhu, a stevedore and basketball player from Shanghai, was also selected for our national team and has attended several international competitions. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国职工体育运动几年来有很大发展
    全国第一届工人体育运动大会开幕前夕，大会负责人对新华社记者介绍了几年来我国广大职工体育运动发展的情形。大会负责人说：据北京、上海、沈阳等十八个城市和铁路系统的统计，经常参加体育运动的职工就有一百一十多万人，各种球队已有三万四千多个。以这次大会为例，参加竞赛的一千七百多名男、女运动员，就是由十五个产业单位和教育、人民银行系统的一百多万职工运动员中选拔出来的。目前，广播体操（工间操）已成为职工群众经常性的体育活动。一般机关和厂矿企业中，有百分之五十左右的职工经常做操。
    各地的体育场地和体育器械也在迅速增加。仅沈阳市现在就有篮、排球和足球场一千二百七十多个，单、双杠和跳箱等有二千六百多付，比一九五零年增加了四倍。一九五四年十一月在全国第一次职工体育工作会议上，又决定把全部工会经费的百分之五到百分之七点五做为职工的体育经费。
    体育运动的开展，对增进职工健康和提高生产等方面起了积极的作用。国营天津第二棉纺织厂一九五四年八月份调查了八个车间的情况，运动员出勤率达到百分之一百。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂在红旗竞赛评奖时，厂内足球和排球代表队队员中，有百分之九十三得了奖。
    随着体育运动的开展，广大职工中已出现了大批体育积极分子和运动能手。一九五四年北京市举行第二届工人体育运动大会时，在三十八个项目中就有二十三项打破了上届的纪录。济南的铁路工人、标枪运动员刘成邦已几次打破全国最高纪录。上海市搬运工人、篮球运动员刘二柱也被选为我国国家代表队，曾几次出席过国际比赛。（新华社）
