How Labor Days are Calculated in Soviet Collective Farms
Soviet Union Ya. Storozhuk

There was a very short period when Soviet collective farms distributed cash and agricultural products to a member not based on the work they actually completed, but simply because they showed up for work. Thus, those who idled away the whole day received the same as those who toiled diligently from morning till night. This "system" could not last long, because it failed to provide collective farm members with a material interest in the high quality of labor and the improvement of labor productivity.

The current method of accurately and fairly evaluating labor in terms of labor days is derived from the experience of Soviet collective farms. Collective farms, based on the complexity and characteristics of various tasks, formulated daily work quotas for these tasks and determined the method of assessing labor days according to the completion of the quotas. In this way, the labor day became a standard for measuring the quality and quantity of work completed. If the quality of work was high and the daily quota was exceeded, the number of labor days credited to a farm member was correspondingly higher; conversely, if the quota was not fulfilled, the number of labor days credited to him was reduced accordingly.

However, eight to ten years ago, it was common for some collective farms to set incorrect, often lowered, work quotas for certain types of work, while simultaneously formulating incorrect, often raised, labor day assessment methods. After meticulously studying this issue, the Soviet government provided assistance to the collective farms. In 1948, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted a resolution recommending to the collective farms standard work quotas and labor day assessment methods formulated based on the experience of advanced farms.

Standard work quotas eliminate the arbitrary determination of the daily workload for a particular type of work. At the same time, these standard work quotas enable us to formulate the most correct labor quotas based on local conditions. For example, the work quota for inter-row loosening of soil for corn and potatoes is set within a range from 0.2 hectares to 0.4 hectares, taking into account the different production conditions of various regions and collective farms. Collective farmers can decide for themselves which quota they prefer to adopt based on local conditions. In 1954, the members of the "Voroshilov" collective farm in the Bashtanka district of Nikolaev Oblast, Ukraine, set the quota for corn loosening at 0.3 hectares, while the neighboring "Stalin" collective farm set the quota at 0.33 hectares because the soil on their farm was looser. The former farm used 0.2 hectares as a work quota for potato loosening, while the latter farm used 0.25 hectares as a work quota.

Each year, collective farms review and revise their work quotas based on the level of mechanization, the improvement of labor productivity, and other developments.

Depending on the degree of difficulty and complexity, all field operations are divided into nine categories, while gardening and vegetable work are divided into seven categories. For each category of work, a labor day assessment method is specified for completing a daily quota. The simplest and easiest work is assessed as half a labor day for completing a day's work quota. The most complex and arduous work, especially tasks like feeding sheaves into the threshing drum of a threshing machine, is assessed as two and a half labor days for completing a day's work quota.

In this way, the labor day becomes a unified measure for evaluating all the diverse types of labor in agriculture.

Collective farms employ a variety of means to provide material encouragement to farm members who achieve bumper harvests and improve the productivity of livestock products. In order to eliminate egalitarianism in labor remuneration and to encourage advanced farm members, some adjustments are made to the labor days settled at the end of the year based on the harvest yield or the amount of livestock products obtained by each work team, group, or livestock farm. In the practical work of collective farms, there are several methods for making these adjustments. Work teams that exceed the harvest plan receive an increase of one percent of the total number of labor days spent on that crop or several crops for each percentage point by which they exceed the planned yield per unit area. Work teams that fail to meet the planned yield per unit area have one percent deducted from the total number of labor days spent on that crop for each percentage point by which the actual yield falls below the planned yield, but the deduction cannot exceed 25 percent of the aforementioned total.

In animal husbandry, the amount of product obtained is also taken into account when settling labor days. Labor days are paid based on the amount of milk milked, the amount of wool sheared, the number of young animals bred and raised, and the increase in the live weight and fatness of livestock.

In Soviet collective farms, the distribution of agricultural products and cash according to labor days is the main form of paying farm members for their labor. However, in addition to this, there are also supplementary rewards. In order to encourage those farm members who exceed planned targets in increasing crop yields per unit area and livestock product productivity, a portion of the products is paid to them in addition to the main remuneration based on labor days. For example, members of work teams that exceed the planned grain yield per unit area can receive one-quarter of the grain they harvested above the plan.

The first work team of the "Path to Communism" collective farm in the Kotovsk district of Odessa Oblast had a planned grain yield of 2.05 metric tons per hectare and actually harvested 2.7 metric tons; the second work team had a planned grain yield of 2.03 metric tons per hectare and actually harvested 2.45 metric tons. The farm allocated 69.1 metric tons of grain to the members of the first work team and 44 metric tons of grain to the second work team as supplementary remuneration. This was equivalent to increasing the remuneration for each labor day earned on grain crops. Each labor day earned by the first work team received an additional 6.1 kilograms of grain, and each labor day earned by the second work team received an additional 4.6 kilograms of grain.

The supplementary remuneration is distributed among the members of the work team in proportion to the number of labor days they spent on that crop. Supplementary labor remuneration is usually paid to collective farm members at the end of the year after the collective farm has fulfilled its obligations to supply and sell products to the state and has established the necessary public funds for the farm itself.

On the collective farm's livestock farms, supplementary labor remuneration is paid in the form of milk, eggs, honey, and various young animals (calves, piglets, lambs).

Here are a few examples. Milkmaid N.B. Leva of the "Bolshevik" collective farm in the Zolotonosha district of Cherkasy Oblast milked an average of 7,300 kilograms of milk per year from each dairy cow assigned to her care. To reward her for achieving this high indicator, the farm paid her 9,000 kilograms of milk as supplementary remuneration. Pig farmer P.K. Nuzhninko of the "Khrushchev" collective farm in the Novopragsky district of Kirovograd Oblast obtained an average of 25 piglets per sow per year. The collective farm paid her 20 two-month-old piglets according to the supplementary remuneration system. The members of the Zhukov work team working on the sheep farm of the "Stalin" collective farm in the Primorsky district of Stalino Oblast received approximately 400 sheep as supplementary remuneration because they had exceeded the planned targets for three consecutive years.

At the request of the farm members, supplementary remuneration can be paid in cash instead of in-kind; in this case, the products that should be paid to the farm members as supplementary remuneration are converted into cash at state procurement prices.

To calculate the work completed by farm members, each work team leader has dedicated registers. Each day, the work team leader records in these registers the work completed by each farm member of the work team during the day and the number of labor days they earned. The work team leader should enter the number of labor days calculated for the farm member into the farm member's labor book at least once a week, and at the same time transfer the labor day calculation register to the accounting office of the collective farm. After carefully checking these figures, the accountant writes them into the labor day ledger; in this ledger, a separate account is set up for each farm member.

At the end of each month, the farm management committee posts a list of the farm members along with a summary of the labor days they have earned in a prominent place in the management committee for everyone to inspect and verify.

The cash and in-kind income of the collective farm is distributed according to labor days at the end of the year. However, according to the charter of agricultural labor cooperatives, collective farms can pay a portion of the main remuneration to their farm members in the form of advances during the year.

In recent years, the method of paying regular advances has been greatly promoted in collective farms. Various forms of advances can be seen: cash advances, grain advances, and advances for meals in public canteens. Cash advances are the most widely implemented. Cash advances are issued either quarterly or monthly, depending on local conditions, the strength of the farm, and other conditions. The amount of the advance is fixed in some farms, while in other farms the amount of the advance fluctuates somewhat during the year.

The system adopted by Soviet collective farms for distributing collective farm income according to the quantity and quality of labor enables each collective farm member to work more and better for the collective farm and to have a material interest in the development of the collective farm's public production.

    苏联的集体农庄怎样计算劳动日
    苏联  雅·斯托罗茹克
    有过一个很短的时期，苏联集体农庄发给一个庄员的现金和农产品，并不是根据他实际完成的工作，而仅仅是因为他去上了工。这样，就使整天游手好闲的人和终日辛勤劳动的人所得到的一样多。这种“制度”是不能长期存在的。因为它不能使集体农庄庄员从物质利益上来关怀劳动的高度质量和提高劳动生产率。
    现行的把劳动按劳动日来加以精确和公平地评定的办法，乃是苏联集体农庄从经验中得来的。集体农庄根据各种工作的复杂性和特点，制定了这些工作的一天工作定额，并据此确定了按照所完成的定额评定劳动日的方法。这样，劳动日便成了衡量所完成的工作的质和量的标准。在工作质量高而又超额完成一天定额的情况下，算给一个农庄庄员的劳动日也相应地多些；反之，在未完成定额的情况下，算给他的劳动日也作相应的减少。
    但是，在八年到十年以前，还常有这样的情形：一些集体农庄给某几类工作制定了一些不正确的、常常是被降低了的工作定额；同时还制定了一些不正确的、常常是被提高了的劳动日评定法。苏联政府在缜密地研究了这个问题以后，对各集体农庄作了帮助。一九四八年苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议通过了关于向各集体农庄推荐那些根据先进农庄的经验而制定的标准工作定额和劳动日评定法的决议。
    标准工作定额排除那种任意决定某类工作的一天工作量的做法。同时，这种标准工作定额还能使我们根据当地条件，制定最正确的劳动定额。例如，对于玉蜀黍和马铃薯的行间松土的工作定额，由于考虑到各个地区和各个集体农庄的生产条件不同，而把它规定在从零点二公顷到零点四公顷的范围之内。集体农民根据当地条件，可以自行决定他们最好采取哪种定额。乌克兰尼古拉也夫州巴什塔区“伏罗希洛夫”集体农庄的庄员们，在一九五四年就确定了玉蜀黍的松土工作定额为零点三公顷，而和它邻接的“斯大林”集体农庄因自己农庄的土质比较松软，就把这一工作定额定为零点三三公顷。前一个农庄的马铃薯松土工作以零点二公顷作为一个工作定额，后一个农庄则以零点二五公顷作为一个工作定额。
    各集体农庄每年都根据机械化水平和劳动生产率的提高以及其他情况的发展，重新审查和变更它们的工作定额。
    根据繁难和复杂的程度，全部田间操作被分为九类，园艺和蔬菜工作则分为七类。每类工作都规定了完成一天定额的劳动日评定法。最简单和轻松的工作，每完成一天的工作定额算半个劳动日。最复杂和繁重的工作，特别是像把禾捆送入打谷机的脱粒滚筒这类工作，每完成一天定额，就算二点五个劳动日。
    这样，劳动日就成了对农业中所有的多种多样的劳动进行评定的统一尺度。
    各集体农庄对于那些取得丰收和提高牲畜产品生产率的农庄庄员的热情劳动，采用着多种多样的方式给以物质鼓励。为消除在劳动报酬中的平均主义并鼓励先进庄员起见，在年终根据每个工作队、小组或饲畜场所取得的收获量或牲畜产品量，对所结算的劳动日数作一些修正。在集体农庄的实际工作中，有好几种这类修正的方法。超额完成收获计划的工作队，每超额完成单位面积产量计划百分之一，就增加这个工作队耗费于该种作物或数种作物上的劳动日总数的百分之一。没有按规定完成单位面积产量计划的工作队，实际产量低于计划产量百分之一，即扣除这个工作队在该种作物上所耗费的劳动日总数的百分之一，但扣除数最多不得超过上述总数的百分之二十五。
    在畜牧业中，在结算劳动日时也要考虑到所取得的产品量。劳动日是按农庄庄员所挤的奶量、所剪的羊毛量、所繁殖和饲养的幼畜头数以及牲畜的毛重和肥度的增长额来付给的。
    在苏联的集体农庄里，按劳动日来分配农产品和现金，是支付农庄庄员劳动报酬的主要形式。但是，除此以外，也还有补充报酬。为了鼓励在提高农作物的单位面积产量和畜牧业的产品生产率方面超额完成计划任务的那些庄员，除根据劳动日给以主要的报酬以外，还把产品的一部分付给他们。譬如，超额完成谷物单位面积产量计划的工作队的队员，可以得到他们超计划收获的那部分谷物的四分之一。
    敖德萨州科托夫区“共产主义之路”集体农庄的第一工作队，谷物计划产量每公顷二十点五公担，实际收获了二十七公担；第二工作队谷物计划产量每公顷二十点三公担，实际收获了二十四点五公担。第一工作队超计划收获了一千九百七十八公担谷物，第二工作队超计划收获了一千二百六十公担。农庄给第一工作队的庄员们拨付了六百九十一公担谷物、第二工作队拨付了四百四十公担谷物，作为补充报酬。这就等于提高了在谷类作物上得到的每个劳动日的报酬。第一工作队的每个劳动日报酬，多加了六点一公斤谷物，第二工作队多加了四点六公斤谷物。
    补充报酬在工作队的队员之间的分配，是按照他们在该项作物上所耗费的劳动日的比例发给的。补充的劳动报酬照例是在年终集体农庄已完成向国家供售产品的义务、并为农庄自己建立了必要的公共基金以后，才发给集体农庄庄员的。
    在集体农庄的饲畜场，补充的劳动报酬是用牛奶、鸡蛋、蜂蜜和各种幼畜（小牛、小猪、小羊）来支付的。
    这里有几个例子。彻尔克斯州佐洛托纳什区“布尔什维克”集体农庄的挤奶女工恩·巴·列娃，在一年中平均从分配给她看管的每头乳牛身上挤了七千三百公斤奶。为了奖励她所达到的高度指标，农庄付给了她九千公斤奶作为补充报酬。基洛夫格勒州新布拉格区“赫鲁晓夫”集体农庄养猪女工甫·卡·努日宁珂在一年中从每口母猪平均得到了二十五只小猪。集体农庄按照补充报酬制度，付给了她二十只两个月大的小猪。在斯大林诺州滨海区“斯大林”集体农庄养羊场工作的茹可夫工作队的庄员们，由于一连三年都超额完成了计划指标，而得到了约四百只绵羊的补充报酬。
    按照农庄庄员们的意愿，补充报酬可以不付给实物，而付以现金；在这种情况下，是把按照补充报酬应付给庄员的产品，按国家的采购价格折算成现金的。
    为计算农庄庄员所完成的工作，各个工作队队长都有专用的一些登记册。工作队队长每天在这些登记册上记入工作队的每个农庄庄员在一天中完成了哪些工作和他所赚得的劳动日数。工作队长至少应每周一次，把为农庄庄员计算的劳动日数登入这个庄员的劳动手册中，同时并把计算劳动日的登记册转交集体农庄的会计处。这些登记册上的数字，经过仔细核对以后，便由会计把它写入劳动日账簿；在这本账簿中，为每个庄员都设立了单独的账户。
    每到月终，农庄管理委员会就把农庄庄员名单连同他们所赚得的劳动日数的一览表，挂在管理委员会的显著的地方，以供大家检查和核对。
    集体农庄的现金和实物收入是在年终按劳动日来加以分配的。但是，根据农业劳动组合章程，集体农庄可以在一年中以预支形式付给本农庄庄员以主要报酬的一部分。
    近年来，定期预支的支付方法，已在各集体农庄中大大推广。可以看到各种形式的预支：现金预支，粮食预支，以及公共食堂伙食的预支。现金预支是实行得最广泛的一种。现金预支或按季度发给或按月发给，视当地条件、农庄的实力和其他条件而定。一些农庄的预支数字是固定不变的，而另一些农庄的预支数字在一年中则有一些起伏。
    苏联集体农庄所采用的按劳动数量和质量来分配集体农庄收入的制度，使每个集体农庄庄员都能更多地和更好地为集体农庄劳动，从物质利益上关怀集体农庄的公共生产的发展。（本报特约稿）
