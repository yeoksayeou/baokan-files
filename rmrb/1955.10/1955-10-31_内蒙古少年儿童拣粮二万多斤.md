Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's children are actively participating in the autumn harvest grain collection movement. According to preliminary statistics, in 14 banners and counties including Dongsheng and Urad Front Banner, more than 4,000 students from 33 primary schools have collected over 20,700 jin of various grains in their spare time. Three hundred students at the Shandai Township Primary School in Sa County proposed the slogan "Quick eyes, quick legs, quick hands," and collected 2,250 jin of grain in five days. More than 1,500 primary school students in Wuyuan County sang songs constantly and were in high spirits while collecting grain. In Linxi County, the collective agricultural cooperative increased its grain income by more than 600 jin due to mobilizing more than 20 children to collect grain. In the past, in the Wuchuan County Red Agricultural Cooperative, the wheat ears left in the field after the autumn harvest were left unpicked, and green wheat seedlings grew. This year, due to mobilizing the children to pick up wheat ears, a large pile of wheat was added to the threshing ground. (Our correspondent in Hohhot)

    内蒙古少年儿童拣粮二万多斤
    内蒙古自治区的少年儿童积极参加秋收拣粮运动，据目前初步统计，东胜、乌拉特前旗等十四个旗、县，已有三十三个小学校的四千多名学生利用课余时间，拣回了各种粮食二万零七百多斤。萨县善岱乡小学三百个学生提出“眼快、腿快、手快”的口号，五天功夫拣粮二千二百五十斤。五原县一千五百多名小学生在拣粮的时候，歌声不断，情绪十分高涨。林西县集体农业社由于发动二十多名儿童拣粮，增加了六百多斤粮食收入。武川县红色农业社往年秋天丢在地里的麦穗没人拣，长起绿泱泱的麦苗，今年，由于发动了娃娃们拾麦穗，场上增加了一座很大的麦堆。（本报驻呼和浩特记者）
