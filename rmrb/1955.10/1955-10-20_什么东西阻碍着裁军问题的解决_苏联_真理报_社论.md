What Hinders the Solution of the Disarmament Problem
—Editorial by the Soviet "Pravda"

Some time ago, newspapers reported that the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee had suspended its work at the initiative of the U.S. representative. Regarding this, millions of people worldwide have raised the question: What exactly has been the result of the Disarmament Subcommittee's work, which, according to the instructions of the Geneva Conference, must play an important role in formulating a mutually acceptable disarmament system?

It must be pointed out that, unfortunately, during the period since the Geneva Conference, the Subcommittee has not taken any practical steps to formulate a mutually acceptable disarmament system and has made no progress on this issue. French representative Jules Moch admitted this fact in his final statement in the Disarmament Subcommittee. He said: "We must frankly admit that the results of our work in New York have disappointed the hopes raised by the London Conference held in the spring, and especially the hopes raised by the Geneva Four-Power Conference."

What exactly is hindering the solution of this extremely important disarmament problem, which is so valued by the people of all countries? Why hasn't the resolution adopted by the United Nations, which has recognized the need for arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons, been implemented?

The answers to these questions can be found by comparing the positions of the various countries participating in the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee and analyzing the extent to which these positions contribute to reaching an agreement on concrete measures aimed at realizing the arms reduction and prohibition of atomic weapons that peace-loving people of all countries expect.

The Soviet Union's position on this issue is clear and firm. The Soviet Union has always advocated, and still advocates, universal arms reduction and disarmament of armed forces, and the prohibition of atomic weapons guaranteed by an effective and practical international control system. The Soviet Union has made every effort to seek a solution to this problem that would satisfy the wishes of the people of all countries. It has taken practical steps to promote the resolution of this issue, such as significantly reducing the Soviet armed forces, abolishing the Soviet military base in Porkkala, and last year completely handing over the Lüshunkou base, previously jointly managed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, to the administration of the People's Republic of China. In an effort to reach an agreement with Western countries, the Soviet Union has made many efforts to bring the positions of the countries closer together in order to pave the way for reaching an agreement. Of particular importance in this regard are the proposals put forward by the Soviet government on May 10 and July 21, in which it attempted to approach the positions of Western countries. It is generally acknowledged that these proposals played a significant role in creating favorable conditions for resolving the arms reduction issue. These proposals included all the main measures concerning the reduction of armaments and armed forces, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the establishment of effective international supervision over the implementation of arms reduction measures.

It is natural to expect that the Subcommittee would carefully consider the Soviet proposals and reach agreement on some issues or put forward points of convergence from various perspectives. What is hindering this issue?

It must be stated very directly and frankly that the main obstacle is the position of the United States, whose representative in the Subcommittee fundamentally expressed doubt about the possibility of arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and raised some technical difficulties related to the control of atomic materials.

The representatives of France, Britain, and Canada indicated their attitude towards the basic disarmament measures proposed in the Soviet proposals, and indicated their agreement to stipulate the levels to which the armed forces of the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France should be reduced.

Moreover, the representatives of France, Britain, and Canada also stated that they agreed in principle that the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons should be implemented after 75 percent of the agreed-upon reductions in conventional armaments and armed forces, as stipulated in the Soviet and Anglo-French proposals, have been achieved.

It is clear that these points of convergence of various positions should be affirmed in order to lay the foundation for further work, during which the necessary details of agreements on the formulation of a mutually acceptable disarmament system can be specifically defined. However, this has not been achieved due to the special position adopted by Mr. Stassen, the U.S. representative in the Subcommittee. He avoided talking about the proposed measures related to arms reduction, merely saying that the United States "reserved" its previous position on these issues. In his final statement, he said that the United States intended to raise some reservations about its previous position.

Therefore, the United States has, in practice, adopted an attitude in the Subcommittee of refusing to accept the decision on arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

The statements made by the U.S. representative in the Subcommittee completely ignored the necessity of prohibiting atomic weapons. This situation is of particular significance if one takes into account the fact that U.S. military leaders frequently demand the large-scale use of atomic weapons in the event of another war.

The U.S. representative in the Subcommittee insisted that it is currently impossible to establish an effective method of supervision that can fully detect all the materials used to manufacture nuclear weapons, and he attempted to use this to explain his position of refusing arms reduction and prohibiting atomic weapons.

However, regardless of the technical difficulties in establishing international supervision, this situation cannot be used as a reason to refuse arms reduction and prohibit atomic weapons. Everyone knows that the United Nations General Assembly, in its many resolutions, including the resolution adopted by the last session on November 4, 1954, reached the conclusion that efforts should be made to reach agreement on complete and unanimously agreed-upon recommendations to be included in the draft international disarmament convention. This means that this convention should stipulate the substantial reduction of all armed forces and all conventional armaments; the complete prohibition of the use and manufacture of nuclear weapons and any type of weapon of mass destruction and the conversion of existing nuclear weapon stockpiles for peaceful purposes; the establishment of effective international supervision to ensure effective compliance with agreements concerning the reduction of all armaments and armed forces and the prohibition of nuclear and other weapons mass destruction, and to ensure that atomic energy is used only for peaceful purposes.

In its proposal of May 10, the Soviet government emphasized the need to consider the establishment of international supervision, emphasizing that the rights and powers of the supervisory body must be closely linked to the implementation of measures to consolidate international trust and the adoption of concrete steps related to arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons. On this issue, the Soviet government put forward detailed and practical proposals. The implementation of the Soviet proposals will ensure effective supervision of arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons. Particularly consistent with this is the Soviet proposal to establish monitoring stations at important locations to prevent the dangerous concentration of troops and armaments, thereby preventing the threat of a sudden attack by one country on another.

However, instead of striving to affirm the common ground between the parties on the issue of arms reduction, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the establishment of international supervision, the U.S. representative focused his attention on the issue of supervision in his various speeches, while ignoring the issues of arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons. But if these issues are set aside, then the issue of supervision becomes empty and meaningless.

The U.S. representative insisted that the implementation of supervision and inspection itself is said to guarantee the conditions for resolving the disarmament issue. In this regard, the British representative also supported his opinion. However, if supervision itself is understood as an end in itself, without measures for arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons, then what value does the term "supervision" have? What is there to supervise? It is clear to everyone that raising the issue in this way will not resolve the disarmament issue, nor will it end the arms race.

Only by reaching a comprehensive agreement on arms reduction, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the implementation of effective international supervision of these measures can the arms race be ended and the threat of war eliminated. This is precisely what the aforementioned United Nations General Assembly resolution of November 4, 1954, and the instructions given by the Geneva Conference to the foreign ministers stated. These documents stipulated the basic principles for drafting a system of supervision and for reducing all armaments and armed forces under effective guarantees.

It should be pointed out that French representative Moch was right in the Disarmament Subcommittee. He said: "Any supervisory plan has no possibility of being accepted without a disarmament plan that is drafted and signed at the same time."

The U.S. representative to the Subcommittee evaded discussion of measures for arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons. All his efforts were aimed at limiting the Subcommittee's activities entirely to studying President Eisenhower's well-known proposal regarding the exchange of military information between the Soviet Union and the United States and the mutual aerial photography of each other's airspace.

As everyone knows, the Soviet Union has always treated the U.S. President's proposal with respect. N.A. Bulganin pointed out in his letter to U.S. President Eisenhower that information needed to be provided to this international supervisory body after an agreement on arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons was reached.

As for aerial photography, N.A. Bulganin's letter raised some opinions and some questions on this issue, and the Soviet Union is awaiting answers to these questions.

Let us recall that the letter stated: "... In your proposal, regrettably, there is no mention of the necessity of reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons. Therefore, there will naturally be more and more people asking: What significance does the proposal regarding aerial photography and the collection of information have for stopping the expansion of armaments? If this proposal cannot contribute to stopping the expansion of armaments, it means that it cannot eliminate the threat of a new war, nor can it alleviate the heavy burdens borne by the people as a result. Does this proposal meet the expectations of our two countries and the residents of countries around the world?

Finally, one cannot help but consider what the consequences would be if we study the issue of aerial photography and the exchange of military information without taking effective measures to reduce armaments and prohibit atomic weapons. I am somewhat concerned and cannot help but say to you: Would this situation relax everyone's vigilance regarding the threat to peace that currently exists due to the expansion of armaments?"

The U.S. representative's attempt to reduce all the work of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee to merely studying this U.S. proposal, while at the same time refusing to affirm at least some of the earlier agreements reached on some of the basic issues of disarmament, can only be regarded as an attempt to write off all the previous resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly that stipulate the drafting of a convention on arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

Based on all these circumstances, we cannot but conclude that the U.S. representative's position is the main reason why the work of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee has not made progress. Despite some promising statements, adopting this position is clearly tantamount to rejecting disarmament. This is the only way to view the United States' policy on this issue.

All of this should be viewed in connection with the statements of certain individuals in the United States who are keen on continuing the expansion of armaments. These people have openly expressed their concern that applying the "Geneva spirit" to the resolution of the disarmament issue would strike a blow to the expansion of armaments. It is precisely for this reason that they are attempting to obstruct the work of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee and are spreading pessimistic sentiments about the upcoming Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference that will study the disarmament issue.

However, the actual resolution of the disarmament issue can no longer tolerate any delays. The people of all countries cannot tolerate the continued expansion of armaments and the resulting threat of an atomic war breaking out. The major powers that bear the primary responsibility for safeguarding peace and security should take this into account. The path to reaching an agreement on practical measures to achieve arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons is achievable and must be found.

As for the Soviet Union, it believes that its proposals can serve as a good foundation for reaching such an agreement. The Soviet Union hopes that the disarmament issue will be studied with due seriousness at the upcoming Foreign Ministers Conference, and hopes that all participants will strive to seek ways to complete this important task of ending the arms race and freeing the people of all countries from the threat of another war.

    什么东西阻碍着裁军问题的解决
    ——苏联“真理报”社论
    前些时候报纸曾经报道，联合国裁军小组委员会根据美国代表的动议，已经中止了它的工作。关于这件事，全世界千百万人都提出了这样一个问题：裁军小组委员会根据日内瓦会议的指示必须在制定一个大家都可以接受的裁军制度方面起重要作用，而它在这方面工作的结果究竟怎样呢？
    必须指出，不幸的是，在日内瓦会议以来的时期中，小组委员会没有采取任何实际步骤来制定一个大家都可以接受的裁军制度，并且在这个问题上没有取得进展。法国代表儒勒·莫克在裁军小组委员会中发表的最后声明中承认了这个事实。他说：“我们必须坦白地承认，我们在纽约进行的工作的结果辜负了我们在春天举行的伦敦会议引起的希望。尤其是辜负了日内瓦四大国会议引起的希望。”
    究竟是什么东西阻碍着这个极其重要而为世界各国人民如此重视的裁军问题的解决呢？为什么联合国已经承认必须裁减军备和禁止原子武器的决议不能得到贯彻呢？
    就参加这个联合国裁军小组委员会的各个国家的立场加以比较以后，在分析了这些立场在多大程度上有助于就目的在于实现爱好和平的各国人民所期待的裁减军备和禁止原子武器的具体措施达成协议以后，就可以找到这些问题的答案。
    苏联对于这个问题的立场是明确的、坚定的。苏联一向主张、并且现在仍然主张普遍裁减军备和武装部队，主张通过一个有效的切实可行的国际监督制度来保证禁止原子武器。苏联已经作出一切努力来寻求一个足以满足各国人民的愿望的解决这个问题的办法。它已经采取了实际的步骤来促使这个问题的解决，例如它大量裁减苏联武装部队，撤销苏联在波卡拉半岛的军事基地，以及去年把以前由苏联和中华人民共和国共同管理的旅顺口基地完全交给中华人民共和国管理。为了力求同西方国家达成协议，苏联曾作了很多努力来促使各国的立场接近起来，以便为达成协议铺平道路。在这方面特别重要的是，苏联政府在五月十日和七月二十一日提出的建议，在这些建议中它设法接近了西方国家的立场。人们普遍承认，这些建议在为解决裁减军备问题创造有利的条件方面起了重大的作用。这些建议包括所有关于裁减军备和武装部队，禁止原子武器和对裁减军备措施的实施建立有效的国际监督的主要措施。
    人们期望小组委员会会仔细地考虑苏联的建议，并且在一些问题上达成协议或者提出各方面观点接近之处，这是很自然的。什么东西阻碍着这个问题呢？
    必须非常直截了当和坦率地说，主要的障碍是美国的立场，美国在小组委员会中的代表对裁减军备和禁止原子武器的可能性根本表示怀疑，而提出了有关管制原子物资的一些技术上的困难。
    法国、英国和加拿大的代表们表明了他们对苏联建议中提出的基本的裁军措施的态度，并且表明他们同意规定美国、苏联、中国、英国和法国的武装部队应当裁减到的水平。
    而且法国、英国和加拿大的代表们还申明他们在原则上同意如苏联和英法建议所规定的，在常规军备和武装部队裁减了一致协议裁减的百分之七十五以后，完全禁止核子武器就应当付诸实行。
    显然应当把这种各方面立场的接近之处肯定下来，以便从而为进一步的工作奠定基础，而在进一步的工作过程中，可以具体规定有关制定一个大家都可以接受的裁军制度的必要协议的详细内容。然而，由于美国在小组委员会的代表史塔生先生采取了一种特别的立场，所以未能实现。他避免谈到有关裁减军备的措施的建议，仅仅说，美国“保留”它以前在这些问题上的立场。他在最后声明中说，美国打算对它以前的立场提出一些保留意见。
    因此，美国在小组委员会中实际上采取了拒绝接受关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的决定的态度。
    美国代表在小组委员会上发表的声明中，完全无视禁止原子武器的必要性。假如考虑到美国军事领袖们经常要求在遇到另一次战争时就大规模使用原子武器这一事实，那末，这种情况就具有特别的意义了。
    美国代表在小组委员会上硬说目前不可能建立一种能够充分发现所有被用来制造核子武器的物资的有效的监督方法，他企图以此来解释他拒绝裁减军备和禁止原子武器的立场。
    但是，不管建立国际监督有什么技术上的困难，这种情况无论如何也不能作为拒绝裁减军备和禁止原子武器的理由。大家知道，联合国大会在它的许多决议中，包括上届会议在一九五四年十一月四日通过的决议中，都得到这样的结论：应该努力就应包括在国际裁军公约草案中的完备的一致同意的建议达成协议。这就是意味着这个公约应该规定大量裁减所有的武装部队和所有的常规军备；完全禁止使用和制造核子武器和任何类型的大规模毁灭性武器并且把现有的核子武器储备改用于和平用途；建立有效的国际监督，以保证关于裁减所有军备和武装部队以及禁止核子和其他大规模毁灭性武器的协议得到有效的遵守，并且保证原子能只用于和平的用途。
    苏联政府在五月十日的建议中，强调必须考虑建立国际监督的问题，强调监督机构的权利和权力必须与实施巩固国际信任的措施和采取有关裁减军备和禁止原子武器的具体步骤密切联系起来。对于这个问题，苏联政府提出了详细的实际的建议。实行苏联的建议将能够保证对裁减军备和禁止原子武器实行有效的监督。特别符合于这一点的是苏联关于在重要地点建立监督站以防止军队和军备的危险的集中，从而防止一个国家对另一个国家发动突然攻击的威胁的建议。
    但是，美国代表不但没有努力来把各方在裁减军备、禁止原子武器和建立国际监督问题上的立场接近的地方肯定下来，反而在他的历次发言中把注意力集中在监督问题上，对裁减军备和禁止原子武器的问题撇开不谈，但是如果撇开这些问题，那末监督问题就成为空洞的，毫无目的的了。
    美国代表硬说实行监督和视察的本身据说就能保证解决裁军问题的条件。在这方面，英国代表也支持他的意见。但是，如果把监督本身就了解成为一种目的，如果没有裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施，那末“监督”这个名词还有什么价值呢？有什么可以监督的呢？大家都很清楚，这样提出问题是不会解决裁军问题，也不会结束军备竞赛的。
    只有就裁减军备、禁止原子武器和对这些措施实行有效的国际监督方面达成了全面的协议，才能结束军备竞赛和消除战争的威胁。上述联合国大会一九五四年十一月四日的决议和日内瓦会议给外长们的指示所说的正是这个意思。这些文件规定了拟订建立监督制度和在有效保证下裁减一切军备和武装部队的基本原则。
    应该指出，法国代表莫克在裁军小组委员会中说得对。他说：“任何监督计划如果没有同时拟订和签订的裁军计划就没有被接受的可能。”
    美国出席小组委员会的代表规避讨论裁军和禁止原子武器的措施，他的一切努力只是为了使小组委员会把它的活动完全仅限于研究艾森豪威尔总统的关于苏联同美国交换军事情报和两国相互在他国领空进行空中摄影的大家都知道的建议。
    大家知道，苏联一直以尊重的态度对待美国总统的这项建议。尼·亚·布尔加宁在他写给美国总统艾森豪威尔的信中指出，在就裁减军备和禁止原子武器达成协议以后，需要向这个国际监督机构提供情报。
    至于空中摄影，在尼·亚·布尔加宁的信里曾就这个问题提出一些意见和一些问题，苏联在等待对这些问题的答复。
    让我们追述一下，那封信里写道：“……在你的建议中，遗憾得很，对于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的必要性只字未提。因此，现在自然会有越来越多的人问：关于空中摄影和收集情报的建议对于停止扩充军备究竟有什么意义呢？如果这种建议不能促成停止扩充军备的话，那就是说，它并不能消除新战争威胁，并不能减轻人民由此而承担的重担。这个建议是否符合我们两国和世界各国居民对我们的期望呢？
    最后，也不能不考虑到，如果我们研究空中摄影和交换军事情报的问题，而不采取有效的措施来裁减军备和禁止原子武器，将会有什么结果。我有些担心，不能不向你说：这种情况是否会使大家对目前还存在的、由于扩充军备所造成的破坏和平的威胁的警惕性松懈下来呢？”
    美国代表企图把联合国裁军小组委员会的全部工作缩小为仅仅研究这一项美国建议，同时又拒绝把至少是早些时候在一些有关裁军的基本问题上获致的协议肯定下来，这种做法只能够被认为是企图
  一笔勾销联合国大会以前作出的、规定草拟一项裁减军备和禁止原子武器公约的所有决议。
    根据这种种情况，我们不能不得出这样的结论：美国代表的立场是联合国裁军小组委员会的工作没有取得进展的主要原因。尽管发表了一些令人抱希望的声明，而采取这种立场显然就等于是拒绝裁军。对美国在这个问题上的政策只能这样看待。
    这一切应该同热中于继续扩充军备的美国某些人士的言论联系起来看。这些人直言不讳地表示担忧：把“日内瓦精神”应用在解决裁减军备问题上，将会使扩充军备遭受打击。正因为这样，他们才企图阻挠联合国裁军小组委员会的工作，并且对即将举行的将要研究裁军问题的四国外长会议散布悲观情绪。
    然而，裁军问题的实际解决再不能容许有任何拖延了。各国人民不能容忍继续扩充军备以及由此产生的爆发原子战争的威胁。对保障和平和安全负有主要责任的大国应当考虑到这一点。在实现裁减军备和禁止原子武器的实际措施方面达成协议的途径是能够而且必须找到的。
    至于苏联，它认为，它的建议可以作为达成这种协议的良好基础。苏联希望，在即将举行的外长会议上，对裁军问题将以应有的郑重态度加以研究，并希望所有的与会者将努力寻求途径来完成结束军备竞赛和使各国人民摆脱另一次战争的威胁这一重要任务。　（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科十七日电）
