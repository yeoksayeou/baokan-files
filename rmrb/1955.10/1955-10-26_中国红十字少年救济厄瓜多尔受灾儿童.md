Xinhua News Agency, 24th. Recently, José A. Egas, the person in charge of the Ecuadorian Red Cross, wrote on behalf of the Ecuadorian Red Cross, the Central Committee of the Ecuadorian Red Cross Youth, and all the disaster-stricken children, to express his heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people and Chinese children for the RMB 3,000 yuan in aid they provided when children in Imbabura Province suffered from the earthquake.

This aid was raised by the Chinese Red Cross Youth to support the appeal of the Ecuadorian Red Cross Youth Department after an earthquake occurred in Imbabura Province in northern Ecuador in late July. The Chinese Red Cross Youth also sent a telegram to express their condolences to the children in Imbabura Province, Ecuador, who suffered from the earthquake.

    中国红十字少年救济厄瓜多尔受灾儿童
    新华社二十四日讯　最近，厄瓜多尔红十字会负责人何塞·阿·埃加斯以厄瓜多尔红十字会、厄瓜多尔红十字少年中央委员会和全体受灾儿童的名义，来信向中国人民和中国儿童在伊姆巴鲁拉省儿童因地震受灾的时候所给予人民币三千元的援助表示衷心的感谢。
    这笔援助款项是中国红十字少年在七月下旬厄瓜多尔北部的伊姆巴鲁拉省发生地震后，为支持厄瓜多尔红十字会少年部的呼吁而募集起来的。中国红十字少年还曾打电报慰问厄瓜多尔伊姆巴鲁拉省受地震灾害的儿童。
