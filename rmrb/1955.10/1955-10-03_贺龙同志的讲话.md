Comrades,

The First National Workers' Games opens today.

So many athletes have been selected from factories, mines, enterprises, grassroots units, workshops, groups, and various production posts to hold this sports event, showing that our country's people's sports have further developed. This sports event is not only the first review of workers' sports since the founding of New China but also a major event in the history of the Chinese working class.

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the People's Republic of China, I extend my heartfelt and warm congratulations to all comrades attending the conference and to our heroic working class!

Comrades, looking back, before liberation, the Chinese working class suffered political oppression, economic exploitation, and physical devastation. At that time, there was certainly no such thing as workers' sports. Only when the working class led the people of the whole country, overthrew the Kuomintang reactionaries, and established New China, becoming the masters of the country and enterprises, and the masters of their own destiny, did sports open its doors to the working class. Today, worker athletes are increasingly appearing in the ranks of outstanding athletes in New China and have developed into a strong force, many of whom are also advanced figures in production. Facts have proved that wherever sports activities have been carried out, not only has the health of the vast number of employees improved, but also good results have been achieved in cultivating the noble communist morality and collectivist spirit of the working masses. Facts have proved that sports have already played a role in production, becoming an important factor in ensuring the completion of the country's First Five-Year Plan and a part of the socialist construction cause.

The care of the Party and the state for the working people is a huge force in promoting the development of our country's people's sports. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, proceeding from the vital interests and long-term future of the working people, have repeatedly instructed that "develop sports and enhance the people's physique" and stipulated that this is an important political task of the Party. Because in our country's socialist construction, the working class not only needs a high degree of class consciousness but also needs a strong body. Sports should never be a tool for only a few people to play with, but must become an important means of mobilizing the masses to serve production and one of the important means of carrying out communist education among the working people.

Trade unions and trade union federations at all levels should regard leading workers' sports as one of their regular tasks. Various sports associations should closely rely on the leadership of the Party and trade unions to effectively carry out sports activities among the working masses, and actively prepare to implement the "Prepared for Labor and Defense" sports system, organize various sports activities, vigorously train cadres and outstanding athletes; at the same time, carry out various beneficial cultural and recreational activities, eliminate the influence and erosion of bourgeois ideology; and strive to learn from the advanced experience and technology of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries to continue to advance our country's sports.

Long live the vanguard of the Chinese working class—the Communist Party of China!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

### 贺龙同志的讲话

    贺龙同志的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    全国第一届工人体育运动大会今天开幕了。
    从工厂、矿山、企业、各基层单位，从车间、小组、各个生产岗位上，选拔出来这样多的运动员，来举行体育运动大会，显示了我国人民体育事业有了进一步的发展。这次体育运动大会，不仅是新中国成立以来工人体育运动的第一次检阅，也是中国工人阶级历史上一个重大事件。
    我代表中国共产党中央委员会和中华人民共和国国务院向大会的全体同志、向我国英勇的工人阶级，致以衷心的热烈的祝贺！
    同志们，回想一下，在解放以前，中国工人阶级身受着政治上的压迫、经济上的剥削、身体上的摧残。那时，当然谈不上什么工人体育运动。只有工人阶级领导全国人民，打倒了国民党反动派，建立了新中国，自己成为国家和企业的主人，成为自己命运的主人，体育运动才为工人阶级打开了大门。今天，工人运动员日渐出现在新中国优秀运动员的行列当中，并且已经发展成为一支雄壮的队伍，其中许多人同时也是生产中的先进人物。事实证明，凡是开展了体育运动的地方，不仅使广大职工的健康状况有了改善，而且在培养工人群众高尚的共产主义品德和集体主义精神方面，也取得了良好的成绩。事实证明，体育运动已经在生产中发生了作用，成为保证完成国家第一个五年计划的一个重要因素，并且是社会主义建设事业的一部分了。
    党和国家对劳动人民的关怀，是推进我国人民体育事业发展的巨大力量。党中央和毛主席从劳动人民的切身利益和远大前途着眼，一再指示“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”，并且规定这是党的一项重要政治任务。因为在我国进行社会主义建设当中，不仅需要工人阶级有高度的阶级觉悟，而且需要有强壮的身体。体育运动决不应当是只供少数人玩乐的工具，而必须成为动员广大群众为生产服务的重要手段，成为向劳动人民进行共产主义教育的重要手段之一。
    各级产业工会和工会联合会应当把领导工人体育运动当作自己的一项经常业务。各个体育协会，要紧紧地依靠党和工会的领导，使体育运动在工人群众中切实地开展起来，并积极准备推行“准备劳动与卫国”的体育制度，组织多种多样的体育活动，大力培养干部和优秀运动员；同时开展各种有益的文化娱乐活动，清除资产阶级思想的影响和侵蚀；努力学习苏联和各兄弟国家的先进经验和技术，把我国的体育运动继续向前推进。
    中国工人阶级的先锋队——中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
