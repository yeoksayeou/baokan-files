Large-scale Development and Consolidation of Agricultural Cooperatives is Possible
Lin Hujia, Deputy Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Zhejiang Province's agricultural cooperative movement experienced relatively rapid development from the autumn of last year to the spring of this year. The number of agricultural production cooperatives increased fifteenfold, from over 3,300 to over 53,000, ushering in a high tide of the agricultural cooperative movement. However, due to right-leaning thinking in leadership, the mistake of dissolving 15,000 cooperatives was made after the large-scale development.

The arrival of the high tide of the agricultural cooperative movement was not accidental. It was the result of the Party's long-term work in rural areas since the land reform, especially the development of mutual aid and cooperation. The large-scale development of agricultural cooperatives in Zhejiang Province after the autumn of last year had been preceded by relatively thorough preparatory work.

1.  Socialist ideology was widely and deeply publicized, and various erroneous ideas were criticized. Since 1954, the general line, the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, and the Constitution have been widely publicized among the masses. At the same time, the implementation of rural work guidelines and class policies was examined within the Party, criticisms were made of the idea of being satisfied with the status quo of the small-peasant economy and the lack of a clear idea of developing socialism, criticisms were made of relaxing reliance on and support for poor peasants, allowing the free development of the rich peasant economy, and unilaterally emphasizing reliance on active elements in production—which was essentially reliance on wealthy peasants. After unifying thinking within the Party, Party organizations at all levels conscientiously implemented the class policy of relying on poor peasants, firmly uniting with middle peasants, and restricting and gradually eliminating the rich peasant economy in the cooperative movement.

2.  The principle of agricultural production increase movement centering on mutual aid and cooperation was conscientiously implemented. In the summer drainage and autumn overproduction movement last year, the cooperatives first mobilized members to tap potential, set plans, and carry out labor competitions within the cooperative, and then introduced and promoted them to the outside world. As a result, the movement was not only widely developed, but also consolidated the cooperatives. In particular, because the masses outside the cooperative recognized the superiority of the cooperative in learning from the experience of increasing production, they asked to join the cooperative and set up cooperatives, forming a high tide of the production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation.

3.  The focus of the Party's leadership was shifted to cooperation. In the autumn of 1954, the Provincial Party Committee requested leading comrades of Party committees at all levels to personally take the lead in rectifying the existing agricultural production cooperatives. As a result, the leadership experience of rectification and construction of cooperatives was solved, and the consolidation of existing cooperatives was also solved, preparing favorable conditions for the large-scale development of cooperatives. At the same time, more than 110,000 grass-roots cadres for running cooperatives were trained, and mass publicity activities such as visits and study were widely organized. For example, since the establishment of the Liming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiayang Township, Guoju District, Zhenhai County, in 1953, it has actively improved the soil, changed farming methods, and developed sideline production such as fish farming, firewood cutting, and transportation, which has increased production year after year and become a model for the surrounding masses to learn from. Some farmers went to visit and learn from more than a hundred miles away. Under the influence of this cooperative, the number of households in the district who joined the cooperative before the autumn harvest last year increased from 3 percent to 58.4 percent.

It can be seen that what plays a decisive role in the timing of the arrival of the cooperative tide is not the early or late liberation of the region, but the clear orientation of socialist transformation of agriculture under the condition of certain mass conditions, and the necessary preparatory work for socialist transformation.

After the large-scale development of cooperatives, why was there a "resolute contraction" and the mistake of dissolving a large number of cooperatives? This is because we did not foresee that the high tide of cooperation would inevitably appear after the above-mentioned work, and we were not ideologically prepared to meet the high tide, but were instead overwhelmed by victory.

Once the socialist mass movement is launched, the countryside is like a big storm, and everyone is swept into the movement. On the streets and alleys, there are discussions. Some are happily preparing to join or set up cooperatives, some are watching the trend and following the crowd, some are panicking, and counter-revolutionaries and class enemies are carrying out sabotage activities in many ways. This situation is basically the same as the situation of the peasant movement in the democratic revolution written by Chairman Mao in the "Report on the Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." It seems that it is not difficult for Communists to express their attitude towards this situation, and they should all say in unison: "Very good." But at this time, an evil wind blew, shouting "The countryside is tense," "The middle peasants are shaking," "Cooperation is advancing rashly, and if we don't dismount quickly, there will be a danger of destroying the worker-peasant alliance." Originally, we were unexpected about such a large-scale development, and we were uncertain about whether it was good or bad. At first, we dared to affirm that the development of this movement was basically good. The sound came, and the working group specializing in inspecting the tension in the countryside came, and more people swayed. The proposition against "rash advance" prevailed, and in actual work, some examples of forcibly pulling middle peasants, excluding poor peasants, and destroying production such as killing pigs, selling cattle, and cutting trees could be found. With such "theory" and "practice," coupled with the fact that grain work at that time took up most of the time and energy of leaders at all levels, and they could not spare time to carry out the work of rectifying and consolidating cooperatives, the difficult problems of "asking for people (cadres running cooperatives) and asking for money (cooperative loans for poor peasants)" were also considered difficult to solve. As time went on, the burden became heavier and heavier, "In order not to risk a reduction in production, what is there to fear if cooperation is slower?" In this way, the policy of "resolute contraction" was adopted, thinking that this was the way out to ease the tension in the countryside, stabilize the mood of middle peasant production, and lead the leap out of the passive position.

In specific work, although the superiority of cooperation and the policy of voluntary mutual benefit in running cooperatives were emphasized, a group of cooperatives that were considered to be poorly run were predetermined, and the masses were mobilized to turn to mutual aid groups or individual households. This led to erroneous practices such as the masses not doing it, cadres going to mobilize Party and League members to take the lead, poor peasants not doing it, and mobilizing middle peasants to do it. At this time, some erroneous propaganda slogans, such as "Individual work is glorious" and "The enthusiasm for individual production is higher than the enthusiasm for cooperative production," also prevailed everywhere. This led the vast number of cadres and peasants astray, causing great political and economic losses to the peasants who withdrew from the cooperative, and putting the leadership in a completely passive position.

Practice is the standard for testing truth. Now, some questions have been answered by facts.

Can the large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives in Zhejiang Province be consolidated and increase production? After the Party Central Committee pointed out and stopped the erroneous policy of "resolute contraction," after carrying out consolidation work, the existing cooperatives are basically consolidated, and more than 90 percent have increased production. Is the reason why such a large proportion of cooperatives have increased production the result of dissolving a group of so-called bad cooperatives? No. Pingyang County in Wenzhou Prefecture developed from 23 cooperatives to 1,637 cooperatives in the large-scale development, an increase of 70 times. Although 160 cooperatives were dissolved in the "resolute contraction," a group of "spontaneous cooperatives" were subsequently approved, and there were still 1,669 cooperatives at the end of July this year. According to the statistics of 898 of them, 97 percent of the spring flowers and early rice increased production. And this is not an isolated example, and the situation is basically the same in places where the policy of "resolute contraction" has not been implemented.

How is the tense situation in the countryside generated? It should be admitted that the tense situation did exist in some places, but the main reason for the tension was not that cooperation developed too quickly, but that there were shortcomings in the actual work of implementing the grain policy, and the seriousness of these shortcomings was exaggerated. The situation changed after the correct implementation of the grain "three fix" policy. The fact that the province had a bumper harvest proved that what some people said at that time, that farmers were lying down and not producing or not producing actively, was a slander against the relationship between the Party and the peasants.

Does the Party have the strength to lead cooperation? The so-called problem of lack of time and energy was basically solved after clarifying the idea that rural work is centered on cooperation and making appropriate arrangements for grain work. And after making up our minds, 12,000 cadres for running cooperatives were also assigned to work posts, and the experience of establishing a mutual aid and cooperation network, a central cooperative, and other mass-run cooperatives was also created. The solution to the problem of cadre experience can be clearly seen from the comparison of two counties: Xindeng County in Zhejiang Province developed the agricultural cooperative movement earlier and better. According to statistics at the end of July this year, 63.43 percent of the rural population participated in cooperatives, and more than 70 percent of the cadres engaged in rural work had experience in running cooperatives. On the contrary, in Tiantai County, where the cooperative movement in the province is poor, only 6.3 percent of the households have joined the cooperative, and only 3.5 percent of the rural cadres in the county had experience in running cooperatives before this spring. It was not until after the summer that a group of full-time cadres for running cooperatives were equipped and gradually increased to 42 percent through practice. This shows that cadres cannot gain experience without practice.

Did the rapid development of cooperatives increase the difficulty of leadership and affect the progress of other work? The opposite is true. Take Xindeng and Tiantai counties as a comparison, and let's look at grain work, which has comparable figures. Both counties are semi-mountainous areas, and the proportion of technical crops is not large. The natural conditions are similar. Tiantai County has 3.96 times as many farmers as Xindeng County. In 1954, Xindeng County completed 103 percent of the grain purchase task, and could transfer 3.66 million catties outside the county in addition to supplying the county. Tiantai County only completed 86.7 percent of the purchase task, and it was not enough to supply the county, and it needed to be subsidized 17.56 million catties. As for agricultural production increase, conscription and other work, Xindeng County is one of the counties at the forefront, while Tiantai County has been reducing production for years, and other work is often behind.

In this way, the so-called insurmountable difficulties at that time have been solved in the development of the movement. Facts have proved that the so-called insurmountable is just an excuse for a passive attitude. If there is a spirit of actively overcoming these difficulties at that time, the mistake of dissolving a large number of cooperatives would never have been made.

Why were we blown down by the evil wind, only afraid of the "tension" in the countryside and not afraid of the backwardness of cooperation? First of all, it is because we lacked sufficient mental preparation in the process of transitioning from the democratic revolution stage to the socialist revolution stage, and we could not see the changes in class relations and class struggle after the land reform, and we did not master the Marxist-Leninist method of class analysis. Therefore, when we heard the confusing wind of "tension in the countryside," we completely lost the ability to distinguish, and mistakenly regarded some out-of-context erroneous statements as the opinions of the Party Central Committee. Therefore, we also doubted the correct slogans that we emphasized in the past, such as accelerating cooperation and striving for agricultural overproduction to adapt to the development of national industrialization. Some people even regarded this as the basis for "rash advance" and criticized it. Therefore, we firmly believed in the "correctness" of the "resolute contraction" policy. Although this ideological confusion began to change after the May meeting of the Party Central Committee, the real change was after studying Chairman Mao's report on agricultural cooperation. Now looking back soberly: Taking the shake of the rich or relatively rich peasants who account for only 20 to 30 percent of the country's peasants as the shake of the middle peasants who account for 70 to 80 percent, modifying the acceleration of agricultural cooperation to adapt to national industrialization to the speed of cooperation development that can be slowed down regardless of the requirements of industrialization, and regarding the non-essential and non-mainstream aspects in the development of the movement as essential and mainstream, what a serious distortion it is! And we lost our way in the face of these fundamental and major issues of socialist construction and transformation. This shows that our socialist ideology is not firm, and the influence of bourgeois ideology and the spontaneous tendency of rich middle peasants' capitalism has not been eliminated. Therefore, these wavering and resistant emotions towards cooperation are reflected in the leadership of the movement. If the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao had not detected and corrected it in time, the consequences would have been disastrous. Secondly, we did not understand the unevenness of the development of the mass movement, and we did not understand the truth that leadership experience and cadre ability must be trained and improved in the movement. Therefore, we were greatly alarmed by certain deviations in the movement, and we demanded perfection from the new forces, fearing to make mistakes, and one-sidedly emphasized stability, losing the courage that revolutionaries should have. This inevitably made our leadership work lag behind the mass movement.

After studying Chairman Mao's instructions, these erroneous influences are being rapidly eliminated. Although the vast number of cadres and the masses have experienced some setbacks, they are still very enthusiastic about socialism after being re-armed. Now, the Party organizations and peasant masses in Zhejiang Province are confidently welcoming a new upsurge of large-scale development of agricultural cooperation.

According to the principle of "overall planning and strengthening leadership," the preliminary plan of the Provincial Party Committee is: Before the autumn of 1956, agricultural production cooperatives should be developed to about 65,000, and the number of households joining the cooperatives should account for about 40 percent of the agricultural population. Before the autumn of 1957, develop to about 100,000 cooperatives (the cooperatives that should be established are basically established), and the number of households joining the cooperatives should account for about 70 percent of the agricultural population. Before the autumn of 1958, the number of households joining the cooperatives should reach about 85 percent of the agricultural population, basically realizing the semi-socialist transformation of agriculture. There are now 47 advanced agricultural production cooperatives in the province. Trial experience has proved that this form is conducive to giving play to the labor enthusiasm of the members and improving the management level of the cooperatives. We plan to gradually expand the scope of the trial in the next two or three years, and strive to gradually transition from semi-socialism to full socialism in the second five-year plan period.

The development of the agricultural cooperative movement will inevitably promote the development of agricultural production. By 1957, in addition to ensuring the completion of the 16.28 billion catties approved by the central government, the province's grain production can also strive to exceed 500 million catties to 700 million catties.

To ensure the realization of the above plan, the important issue is to study Chairman Mao's instructions and the resolutions of the Party Central Committee, unify thinking within the Party, correctly accept past experience, seek the rapid and good development of the cooperative movement, and prevent spontaneity and commandism. After conveying Chairman Mao's instructions, Zhejiang Province is now, in accordance with the requirements of overall planning, personally handling the work of the county Party committee, with three or five responsible cadres, each with several experienced cadres for running cooperatives as assistants, going deep into three or five representative types of townships to help the local township branches mobilize the masses to formulate overall planning. After the county Party committee gains experience, this work will be carried out in batches throughout the county. The Provincial Party Committee strives to basically complete the plan for the first development of cooperatives after this autumn before the end of December, and to formulate overall plans for all levels above the township. Before the overall planning work and the establishment of cooperatives are carried out in batches, all cadres for running cooperatives must be given a systematic education and assessment. According to the results of the assessment, the strength will be allocated, and the scale and speed of each batch of deployment will be determined. When the movement is launched, the county Party committee must draw a group of experienced cadres to carry out the review work, and strive to discover problems and solve them in time.

The large-scale development of cooperation requires the close cooperation of all aspects of the Party's work. First of all, it is required that there be a unified overall plan for Party building and rectification and League building and rectification, so that Party building and rectification and League building and rectification are closely integrated with the cooperative movement. All rural work departments related to agriculture, forestry, local industry and handicrafts, bank credit cooperation, commerce and supply and marketing cooperation, and cultural and educational work must, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, formulate the plans of each department in accordance with the overall plan for the development of cooperation, strive to promote the development of cooperation from various aspects, and carry out various construction work in the new situation of agricultural cooperation.

With the resolutions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's instructions, with the foundation of the existing cooperation, and with the profound lessons in past work, as long as we work hard, the task of socialist transformation of agriculture in Zhejiang Province can be expected to be completed ahead of schedule.

    农业合作社大发展和巩固是可能的
    中共浙江省委副书记　林乎加
    浙江省农业合作化运动在去年秋季到今年春季的一段时间内有过比较快的发展，农业生产合作社由三千三百多个发展到五万三千多个，增加了十五倍，出现了农业合作化运动的高潮。但是由于领导思想上的右倾，在大发展之后犯了解散一万五千个合作社的错误。
    农业合作化运动高潮的到来，不是偶然的。它是从土地改革以来，党在农村进行了长期工作，特别是进行了发展互助合作工作的结果。浙江省去年秋后农业合作社的大发展，曾经进行了比较充分的准备工作。
    一、广泛地深入地宣传了社会主义思想，批判了各种错误思想。一九五四年以来，在群众中广泛展开了总路线宣传、粮食统购统销政策和宪法宣传；同时在党内检查了农村工作方针和阶级政策的执行情况，批判了满足于小农经济现状、缺乏明确的发展社会主义的思想，批判了放松依靠和扶持贫农、听任富农经济自由发展和片面地强调依靠生产中的积极分子——实质上是依靠富裕农民的思想。党内思想统一以后，各级党组织在合作化运动中认真执行了依靠贫农，巩固地团结中农，限制和逐步消灭富农经济的阶级政策。
    二、认真执行了以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动的方针。在去年夏季排涝和秋季超额增产运动中，合作社首先在社内发动社员挖潜力，订计划，开展劳动竞赛，然后向社外介绍推广。结果既使运动有了广泛的发展，也使合作社巩固了。特别是由于社外群众在学习增产经验中认识到合作社的优越性，纷纷要求入社和办社，形成了以互助合作为中心的增产运动的高潮。
    三、把党的领导重点转到了合作化方面。一九五四年秋季，省委曾要求各级党委的领导同志亲自动手带头整顿好现有的农业生产合作社。这样做的结果，既解决了整社、建社的领导经验问题，又解决了现有社的巩固问题，为合作社的大发展准备了有利条件。同时训练了基层办社干部十一万多人，广泛地组织了群众性的参观、访问等宣传活动。如镇海县郭巨区下阳乡黎明农业生产合作社从一九五三年建社以来，由于积极改良土壤，改变耕作方法，开展养鱼、砍柴、运输等副业生产，年年增产，成为周围群众学习的模范；有的农民从一百里路以外前去访问、学习。在这个社的影响下，去年秋收以前全区入社农户由百分之三发展到百分之五十八点四。
    由此可见，合作化高潮到来的先后，起决定作用的不是地区解放的早晚，而是在具备了一定的群众条件的情况下，对于农业有明确的开展社会主义改造的方针，并为社会主义改造进行了必要的准备工作。
    在合作社大发展以后，为什么又来个“坚决收缩”，犯了大批解散合作社的错误呢？这是因为我们没有预见到经过上述工作以后必然要出现合作化的高潮，没有迎接高潮的思想准备，反而被胜利吓昏了头脑。
    社会主义的群众运动一经发动起来，农村中就像大风暴到来了一样，所有的人都被卷入运动中。街头巷尾，议论纷纷。有的欢欣鼓舞地张罗入社或办社，有的看大势、随大流，有的恐慌不安，反革命分子和阶级敌对分子就多方面进行破坏活动。这种情况和毛主席在“湖南农民运动考察报告”中所写的民主革命中的农民运动情况基本上是一样的。看来共产党人对于这种情况是不难表示态度的，应该是众口同声：“好得很。”但是在这个时候，刮来一股歪风，大叫“农村紧张”、“中农动摇”、“合作化冒进了，如果不赶快下马，就有破坏工农联盟的危险”。本来我们对于这样的大发展，就是出乎意外的，是好是坏，疑惑不定。起初还敢肯定这个运动的发展基本上是好的，风声传来，专门检查农村紧张的工作组派来，摇摆的人多了，反“冒进”的主张占了上风，在实际工作中还可以找到若干强拉中农，排斥贫农，以及若干杀猪、卖牛、砍树等破坏生产的例子。有了这样的“理论”和“实际”，再加上当时的粮食工作占去了各级领导人员的大部分的时间和精力，抽不出手来进行整顿、巩固合作社的工作，下面“要人（办社干部）、要钱（贫农合作贷款）”的困难问题也认为不好解决。随着时间的发展，担子越挑越重，“为了不冒减产的风险，合作化慢点怕什么呢？”这样，“坚决收缩”的方针就被采取了，以为这是缓和农村紧张、稳定中农生产情绪、领导跳出被动地位的出路。
    在具体工作中虽然强调了宣传合作化的优越性和办社的自愿互利政策，但是因为预先框定一批认为办不好的社，动员群众转为互助组或单干，这就出现了群众不干，干部去动员党、团员带头干，贫农不干，动员中农干等错误的作法。这时，一些错误的宣传口号，如“单干光荣”、“单干生产积极性高于合作生产积极性”等等，也到处流行。这就把广大干部和农民群众引入了歧路，使退社农民在政治上、经济上都受到了很大的损失，使领导陷入完全被动的地位。
    实践是检验真理的标准。现在，若干疑问已经有了事实的答案。
    浙江省农业生产合作社大发展起来，能否巩固能否增产呢？在党中央指出并且制止了“坚决收缩”的错误方针以后，经过进行巩固工作，现有合作社基本上是巩固了，百分之九十以上得到增产。增产的合作社占这样大的比例，这是否是因为解散了一批所谓不好的合作社的结果呢？不是的。温州专区的平阳县，在大发展中从二十三个社发展到一千六百三十七个社，增加了七十倍；虽然在“坚决收缩”中解散了一百六十个社，但是随后又批准了一批“自发社”，今年七月底仍有一千六百六十九个社。根据其中八百九十八个社的统计，春花、早稻增产的占百分之九十七。而且这并不是个别的例子，在没有执行“坚决收缩”方针的地方，情况基本上都是这样。
    农村紧张情况是怎样产生的呢？应该承认紧张情况在某些地方是有过的，但是产生紧张的主要原因不在于合作化发展过快，而在执行粮食政策的实际工作中有缺点，这些缺点的严重程度又被夸大了。在正确执行粮食“三定”政策以后情况就改变了。全省丰收的事实，证明当时某些人所说的农民躺下来不生产或不积极生产，是对党和农民关系的诬蔑。
    党有没有力量来领导合作化呢？所谓时间、精力来不及的问题，在明确认识了农村工作以合作化为中心的思想，对粮食工作做了适当的安排以后，就基本上解决了。而且在有了决心以后，办社干部一万二千人也调配到工作岗位上去了，建立互助合作网、中心社等群众办社的经验也创造出来了。干部经验问题的解决，从两个县的对比中可以看得很清楚：浙江省的农业合作化运动以新登县发展较早、较好，今年七月底统计，那里已有占农村人口百分之六十三点四三的农户参加了合作社，从事农村工作的干部已经有百分之七十以上有了办社的经验。相反地，全省合作化运动较差的天台县，入社的农户仅占农村人口的百分之六点三，全县农村干部有办社经验的今春以前只占总数的百分之三点五，直到夏季以后配备了一批办社专职干部，经过实践，才逐渐提高到百分之四十二。这就说明，干部不经实践，就不可能取得经验。
    合作社发展快了，是不是增加了领导的困难，影响其他工作的进行呢？事实恰恰相反。就以新登、天台两县作对比，拿有数字可比的粮食工作看吧，两县都是半山区，技术作物比重都不大，自然条件是差不多的，天台县农户为新登县的三点九六倍。一九五四年度，新登县完成了粮食征购任务的百分之一百零三，除本县供应外，还可以外调三百六十六万斤；天台县征购任务只完成了百分之八十六点七，全部供应本县都不足，还须补给一千七百五十六万斤。至于农业增产、征兵等工作，新登县都是走在前列的县份之一，而天台县连年减产，其他工作也常落在后头。
    这样，当时所谓不可克服的困难，在运动发展中都已经解决了。事实证明，所谓不可克服，只是消极态度的借口。对当时这样一些困难如果有积极克服的精神，就绝不会犯大批解散合作社的错误。
    我们为什么会被歪风吹倒，只怕农村“紧张”而不怕合作化落后呢？首先是因为我们在从民主革命阶段转变到社会主义革命阶段的过程中，缺乏充分的精神准备，看不清土地改革以后阶级关系、阶级斗争的变化，又没有掌握马克思列宁主义的阶级分析的方法。因此，在听到“农村紧张”的迷惑人的风声时，便完全失去辨别能力，误将若干断章取义的错误说法当作是党中央的意见，因而对于过去强调的加速合作化、争取农业超额增产以适应国家工业化的发展等正确口号也发生怀疑，有的人甚至认为这是“冒进”的论据而加以批判。因此，我们就对于“坚决收缩”方针的“正确”性深信不疑。这种思想混乱情况，在党中央五月会议以后，虽然已经开始转变，但是真正转变还是在学习了毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告之后。现在清醒过来看：把只占全国农民百分之二十到三十的富裕的或比较富裕的农民的动摇看作是占百分之七十到八十的中农动摇，把加速农业合作化以适应国家工业化修改为可以不顾工业化的要求而放慢合作化发展的速度，把运动发展中的非本质方面和非主流方面当作本质和主流，这是多么严重的歪曲呵！而我们就在这些社会主义建设和改造的根本性的重大问题面前迷失了方向。这就说明我们的社会主义思想是不坚定的，资产阶级思想和富裕中农的资本主义自发倾向的思想影响还没有肃清。因此，这些对合作化的动摇抵触情绪就反映到对运动的领导中来。如果没有党中央和毛主席的及时察觉和纠正，后果真会不堪设想。其次是对群众运动发展的不平衡性理解不够，对领导经验、干部能力要在运动中得到锻炼和提高的真理认识不够，因此，对运动中发生的某些偏差大惊小怪，对新生力量求全责备，生怕犯错误，片面强调稳，失去了革命者应有的胆略，这就必然使自己的领导工作落在群众运动的后头。
    经过学习毛主席的指示以后，这些错误影响正在迅速清除。广大的干部和群众虽然经过一番挫折，但是在重新武装起来以后，社会主义的积极性仍然是很高的。现在，浙江全省的党组织和农民群众正满怀信心地迎接农业合作化大发展的新高潮。
    按照“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，省委的初步规划是：在一九五六年秋季以前，农业生产合作社要发展到六万五千个左右，入社农户占农业人口的百分之四十左右；到一九五七年秋季以前，发展到十万个社左右（应建的社基本上都建立起来），入社农户占农业人口的百分之七十左右；到一九五八年秋季以前，入社农户要达到农业人口的百分之八十五左右，基本上实现对农业的半社会主义改造。全省现在有高级农业生产合作社四十七个，试办经验证明：这种形式有利于发挥社员的劳动积极性和提高合作社的经营管理水平。我们计划在最近两三年内逐年扩大试办范围，争取在第二个五年计划时期内逐步由半社会主义过渡到全社会主义。
    农业合作化运动的发展，必然促进农业生产的发展。到一九五七年，全省粮食生产除保证完成中央核定的一百六十二点八亿斤以外，并且可以争取超过五亿斤到七亿斤。
    保证上述规划的实现，重要的问题是学习毛主席的指示和党中央的决议，统一党内思想，正确地接受过去的经验，求得合作化运动既快又好地发展，防止自流和命令主义。浙江省在传达毛主席的指示以后，现在正按照全面规划的要求，各县由县委三、五个负责干部亲自动手，各带几个有经验的办社干部作为助手，深入三、五个有代表性的不同类型的乡，帮助当地乡支部进行发动群众制定全面规划的工作。在县委取得经验以后，再在全县范围内分批进行这一工作。省委争取全省在十二月底以前基本完成今年秋后第一次发展合作社的计划，并且订出乡以上的各级全面规划。在全面规划工作和建社工作分批展开以前，对所有办社干部要进行一次系统的教育和考核；并根据考核的结果，调配力量，确定每批展开的规模和速度。在运动展开的时候，县委要抽出一批有经验的干部进行复查工作，求得及时发现问题及时解决。
    合作化的大发展，需要有党的各项工作的密切配合。首先要求在建党整党和建团整团工作上有统
  一的全面规划，做到建党整党、建团整团同合作化运动密切结合。农林工作、地方工业和手工业工作、银行信贷合作工作、商业和供销合作工作以及文教工作等等一切有关农村工作部门，都必须在党委统一领导下，根据合作化发展的全面规划订出各部门的规划，求得从各个不同方面推动合作化的发展，并且在农业合作化新的形势下展开各项建设工作。
    有了党中央的决议和毛主席的指示，有了现有合作化的基础，有了过去工作中的深刻教训，只要我们认真努力，浙江省的农业社会主义改造任务是可以预期提早完成的。
