Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 10th: According to TASS, "Pravda" published a New York dispatch by Leonidov and Yevgenyev on the 9th, commenting on the reasons why the Disarmament Commission's subcommittee, which concluded its five-week work at the United Nations headquarters in New York on the 7th, has not achieved the expected results so far.

They wrote: The people of all countries in the world ardently hope that the Disarmament Subcommittee can make progress on solving problems of great importance to all countries, such as the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of nuclear weapons.

They wrote: Some events that occurred before the subcommittee reconvened had created favorable conditions for negotiations. Due to the Soviet Union's agreement to some suggestions previously made by Western countries and the substantial reduction of armed forces by the Soviet Union, the solution of the disarmament issue already possesses a practical basis.

The authors pointed out that the Soviet delegation attending the subcommittee suggested recording the agreements already reached on certain aspects of the disarmament issue and proceeding with work from this aspect. However, this did not happen. One fact that hindered this work was that until the last meeting, the members of the subcommittee were not clear about the attitude of the US representative towards the suggestions that seemed to have been agreed upon, namely: the level to which the armed forces of the five major powers and other countries should be reduced; the effective date of the complete prohibition of atomic weapons within the scope of the overall disarmament plan; and the obligation of all countries not to be the first to use such weapons before the agreement on the complete prohibition of atomic weapons comes into effect. The attitude of the US representative towards these suggestions was that the United States made "reservations" about all the positions it had previously held on the disarmament issue.

Foreign journalists who covered the United Nations news frankly said in their conversations with each other that the US delegation's statement erased all the extensive work that the subcommittee had completed and that had brought the attitudes of the countries closer.

The entire content of the suggestions put forward by the US delegation in the subcommittee, simply put, was nothing more than insisting on discussing aerial photography and the exchange of military intelligence. On the other hand, the US delegation avoided discussing the reduction of armed forces and armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

The "New York Herald Tribune," in analyzing the attitude adopted by Stassen, came to the conclusion that the current attitude of the United States is not for the reduction of armaments in the near future. The newspaper pointed out that the United States has no intention of reaching any agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons or the prohibition of organizing the production of atomic weapons or the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons at present.

Leonidov and Yevgenyev pointed out that it can be seen from here why the work of the subcommittee has not made significant progress. The authors concluded by saying that it is now entirely possible to reach an agreement on several important aspects of the disarmament issue. The Soviet Union has always been consistent in word and deed, and it has already begun to reduce its armed forces. Now it is up to the Western countries.

### “真理报”载文评裁军小组委员会的工作

    “真理报”载文评裁军小组委员会的工作
    新华社十日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：联合国裁军委员会小组委员会七日结束了它在纽约联合国总部进行了五个星期的工作。“真理报”九日发表列昂尼多夫和叶夫根涅夫的纽约通讯，评述小组委员会的工作迄今尚未获得预期的结果的原因。
    他们写道：全世界各国人民热切地希望裁军小组委员会能够在解决像裁减军备、禁止核子武器这样的对所有国家都具有非常的重要性的问题上有所进展。
    他们写道：在小组委员会复会以前发生的一些事情已经替谈判创造了良好条件。由于苏联同意了西方国家在早些时候提出的某些建议和苏联大量裁减了武装部队，裁军问题的解决已经具备了一个实际的基础。
    作者指出，出席小组委员会的苏联代表团建议把关于裁军问题某些方面已经获得的协议记录下来，从这方面来着手进行工作。然而结果并没有这样。阻碍这方面工作的一个事实是：直到最后一次会议，小组委员会的委员们还不清楚美国代表对看来已经获得协议的建议所持的态度，这些建议就是：五大国和其他国家的武装部队应该裁减的水平；在总的裁军计划的范围内完全禁止原子武器的生效时间；在完全禁止原子武器的协定生效以前，各国承担不首先使用这种武器的义务。美国代表对这些建议所持的态度是：美国对它从前曾经就裁军问题所持的所有立场作了“保留”。
    采访联合国消息的外国记者们在他们彼此谈话中坦白地说，美国代表团用这种声明把小组委员会已经完成的并且已经使各国态度更为接近的所有广泛的工作，一笔勾销了。
    美国代表团在小组委员会中所提出的建议的所有内容，简单说来不过是坚持要讨论空中摄影和交换军事情报的问题。另一方面，美国代表团却对裁减武装部队和军备以及禁止原子武器问题避而不谈。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”在分析史塔生所采取的态度时得到了这样的结论：美国代表目前的态度不是为了在最近将来裁减军备。这个报纸指出，美国无意在目前就禁止原子武器或禁止组织原子武器的生产或禁止原子武器的使用达成任何协议。
    列昂尼多夫和叶夫根涅夫指出，从这里可以看出小组委员会的工作没有取得重大进展的原因。作者最后说，现在完全有可能就裁军问题的几个重要方面达成协议。苏联一向是言行一致的，它已经开始裁减它的武装部队。现在就要看西方国家了。
