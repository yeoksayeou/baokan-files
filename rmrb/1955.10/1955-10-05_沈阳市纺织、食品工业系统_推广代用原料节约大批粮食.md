    Shenyang Textile and Food Industry Systems
    Promote Substitute Raw Materials, Saving Large Amounts of Grain
    The Shenyang textile and food industry systems have promoted the use of various substitute raw materials, saving a large amount of industrial grain for the country. This year, the Shenyang Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has used water glass made of silica and soda ash instead of sorghum rice starch sizing in ninety-nine motorized and manual weaving factories throughout the city. In the first half of the year, it saved more than 130,000 jin of starch for the country. It is estimated that more than 430,000 jin of industrial grain will be saved throughout the year. In May of this year, the technical workers of the Shenyang No. 3 Food Factory successfully used bran instead of sorghum for "saccharification and decomposition" to manufacture vinegar, which will save more than 300,000 jin of grain throughout the year. The vinegar manufacturing process is also shortened by seven days compared to using sorghum. This year, more than thirty food factories in the city also successfully used bran to manufacture syrup for industrial sand casting processing. According to statistics from the Municipal Grain Bureau, this substitute can save more than 3.2 million jin of industrial grain throughout the year. At present, all machinery factories in Shenyang, except for the railway system, have adopted bran-made syrup for production.
    In addition, this year, the Shenyang food industry also promoted the method of using cold-pressed soybean meal from the Shenyang No. 5 Grain Processing Factory to make tofu, which can produce 3.4 million jin more soybean oil throughout the year, equivalent to saving 26.55 million jin of soybeans.

    沈阳市纺织、食品工业系统
    推广代用原料节约大批粮食
    沈阳市纺织、食品工业系统推广各种代用原料为国家节约了大批工业用粮。沈阳市花纱布公司今年在全市九十九个电机、手工织布厂利用硅石和纯碱制成的水玻璃代替高粱米淀粉浆纱，上半年共为国家节约了十三万多斤淀粉。全年可节约四十三万斤以上的工业用粮。今年五月沈阳市第三食品工厂技术工人利用糠代替高粱进行“糖化分解”制造醋成功，全年将节约粮食三十万多斤。醋的制造过程还比用高粱时缩短了七天。全市三十多家食品工厂今年还利用糠制造工业翻砂加工用的糖稀获得成功，据市粮食局统计这种代用品全年能节约三百二十多万斤工业用粮。目前沈阳市机械工厂除铁路系统外，均已采用糠制糖稀进行生产。
    此外，沈阳市食品工业今年还推广了沈阳第五粮谷加工厂冷榨豆粕做豆腐的方法，全年能多出豆油三百四十万斤，等于节约大豆二千六百五十五万斤。　（本报驻沈阳记者）
