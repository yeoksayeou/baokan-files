Jilin Province Achieves Bumper Rice Harvest

This year, farmers in Jilin Province vigorously constructed farmland water conservancy projects, expanding the paddy field area by more than 17,900 hectares. The planted rice generally achieved a bumper harvest. The average yield per hectare can reach more than 8,000 jin, which is more than double the yield of dry land. Irrigated dry land also increased production by about 25 percent compared to dry land. The province's total increase in rice production amounted to more than 54,000 tons.

Jilin Province is rich in water resources. According to preliminary planning based on available materials, the province can develop more than 700,000 hectares of paddy fields. The plan for next year is to develop 45,000 hectares of paddy fields, increasing grain production by 80,000 tons. At present, farmers in various regions are actively building small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. By mid-September, Panshi County had completed six projects, including reservoirs and ponds. The province has also trained more than 6,000 farmer water conservancy technicians to return to their hometowns and lead the masses in building small-scale farmland water conservancy projects.

    吉林省水稻获得丰收
    吉林省农民今年大力兴修农田水利，扩大水田面积一万七千九百多垧，所种水稻普遍获得丰收。每垧平均可产八千余斤，比旱田增产二倍多；旱田水浇地也比旱田增产百分之二十五左右，全省共计增产水稻五万四千多吨。
    吉林省的水利资源很丰富，根据现有材料初步规划，全省可发展水田七十多万垧，计划明年开发水田四万五千垧，增产粮食八万吨。目前，各地农民正在积极兴修小型农田水利工程。磐石县到九月中旬已有六处水库、塘坝等工程完工。全省还训练了六千多名农民水利技术手，以便回乡领导群众兴修小型农田水利工程。　（王有士）
