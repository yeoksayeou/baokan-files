How a Bumper Harvest Came About

By our correspondent Shen Shi

At the founding of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the men and women fighters of the Manas River basin presented their esteemed gifts. These gifts were not banners, nor bouquets, but cotton plants laden with bolls.

Count the bolls on a single plant: more than one hundred and fifty.

Such a gift expressed the noble hearts of the fighters, and fully demonstrated that the Manas River basin had once again achieved a large-scale bumper cotton harvest this year.

The bumper harvest brought a tense and joyous atmosphere of labor. Thousands upon thousands of people, from dawn to dusk, bathed in the boundless cotton sea, bending over and picking non-stop. Near Mushroom Lake, cotton picking machines appeared for the first time. The cotton drying fields were a vast expanse of white, not the snow of the Tianshan Mountains, not the salt fields on the beach, but newly picked cotton.

82,000 mu of cotton fields, with an average yield of 420 jin per mu, determined by using advanced Soviet methods. This is truly something to rejoice over for those who planted the cotton. They had been busy from late spring to late autumn, hoping for high yields and increased production, to produce more grain and cotton for the motherland, and to let the flowers of socialist construction in the Junggar Basin bloom even more brilliantly.

It is not easy to turn barren land into fertile fields and make cotton fields spit out millions of soft silver stars. From the time of using earth chisels and two-ox plows to reclaim the first piece of wasteland, to the period when horse-drawn farm implements, tractors, combine harvesters, and cotton picking machines roamed the fields, people endured hunger and cold, worried, and sweated. In those difficult days, something like this happened at a farm near Mushroom Lake: A soldier from the second company took a wooden board from the cattle trough to his kang (heated brick bed). When Company Commander Ma Guorui and Instructor Lian Dianbang learned of this, they immediately brought him in and said sternly to him: "We rely mainly on cattle for cultivating the land now. Taking good care of the cattle is for the sake of production. When you took the board from the cattle trough, didn't you think about this year's production tasks?" The soldier felt very bad when he heard this, and immediately put the wooden board back on the cattle trough.

This year, when cultivating the cotton fields, the drivers of this farm began to use cultivators, but their skills were not yet proficient. Zhao Wanchi, the captain of the mechanized cultivation team, closely followed behind the cultivators from early morning to dusk, carefully observing how the tractor pulled the cultivator. He saw that there were many injured and crushed seedlings, and picked up a bundle. At this time, Zhu Hongmei, a female soldier from the first company, came to the cotton field she managed. Seeing the crushed cotton seedlings, she could not help but shed tears. She picked up a bundle of crushed seedlings, ran to the mechanized cultivation team, and said sadly to Zhao Wanchi: "Captain! Look!" Zhao Wanchi had already been considering the issue of damaged seedlings. He called the drivers over, pointed to the cotton seedlings, and said to them: "Comrades! Look! What is this?" The drivers lowered their heads and remained silent.

"Damaging the seedlings is a serious problem. If many seedlings are damaged, what will be the consequences? Think about it," Zhao Wanchi continued.

The drivers all understood that more damaged seedlings would affect the cotton yield. But their skills were not yet proficient, so what could they do? Just when they needed help, Zhao Wanchi explained what he had observed in the cotton fields, pointing out that the seedling damage was due to a problem with the adjustment of the cultivators. He taught everyone how to adjust the cultivators, and the drivers did as he said, greatly reducing the damage to the seedlings.

Zhao Wanchi, the son of a poor peasant, had never attended school. During the defense of Yan'an, he served in the famous Training Brigade as the leader of the telephone platoon. The life of the telephone platoon made him love machines. When he was transferred to the mechanized cultivation team, he came into contact with complex agricultural machinery for the first time. He didn't understand anything. The drivers on the team, like him, were all novices. The tractors often stopped in the field and could not be started. However, not understanding didn't defeat him. Day and night, Zhao Wanchi stayed with the drivers, researching together. When they were tired, they lay down on the wasteland. Whenever he heard the tractor stop from his drowsy sleep, he immediately got up to help the drivers troubleshoot the tractor. Once, he suffered from malaria. The drivers said: "Captain, go back and rest well." But he was worried about the reclamation of the wasteland, how could he rest easy and return to the team? When the malaria attacked, he lay down and covered himself with his coat. After the attack passed, he was with the drivers again. Through diligent study, he had become familiar with the performance and structure of all kinds of agricultural machinery in the mechanized cultivation team.

In this mechanized cultivation team, thanks to Zhao Wanchi's encouragement and help, driver Deng Xiushan used the principle of "three points forming a straight line" to create a seeding aiming device, enabling the tractor to pull the seeder to sow evenly and straight.

In this mechanized cultivation team, thanks to Zhao Wanchi's encouragement and help, Chen Guangjun, a fitter in the repair team, converted the cultivator into a fertilizer applicator, which was pulled by a tractor, applying fertilizer to an average of 21 mu per hour. In the past, using a horse-drawn fertilizer applicator, they could only fertilize a maximum of 45 mu per day.

What made the girl managing the cotton field shed tears when she saw the crushed seedlings? What made Zhao Wanchi stay in the field even when he had malaria? There was nothing else, it was their high sense of responsibility for socialist construction. What enabled Zhao Wanchi to become familiar with the farm's existing agricultural machinery in just three years? There was nothing else, it was his noble quality of not bowing to difficulties, and this quality had been cultivated in the many years of Party education and in the battles of Qinghuabian, Yangmahe, Panlong, Shajiadian, and Wazijie.

With these lovely people, the border of the motherland is naturally changing its face by leaps and bounds. Look at the southern edge of the Kurbantungut Desert. In the past, it was just a wild jujube forest. Today, replacing the jujube forest are more than ten li of cotton fields. Some people call this place "the Jiangnan on the edge of the desert." This beautiful name was won by the soldiers with their own hands. Downstream of the Manas River, there is a place called Xigobi (West Gobi). Two years ago, it was still wasteland covered with red willow and camel thorns. This year, the cotton there, 103 mu, has an average yield of 1,030 jin per mu. And the so-called Xigobi is just a habitual name now.

In these days of bumper harvest, the people on the farm all understand that they must pick the cotton before the soil freezes, otherwise, the winter plowing of these cotton fields will be delayed. We cannot let the tractors plow frozen soil! A sense of responsibility is urging them on. People have stepped into the cotton fields with the steamed buns they eat at noon. Recent junior high school graduates from Henan and Hebei have also joined the ranks of cotton picking. The dew wets their trouser legs and sleeves. Let the sun dry it when it rises! More and more cotton picking experts are emerging: Zhang Shihua, Gong Shulan... these girls from Shandong pick more than 300 jin a day. Gong Lianzhi, Ge Guizhen, and Wang Honglu were the first at the Wulawusu Farm to pick more than 200 jin a day.

Picking two or three hundred jin of cotton a day is not easy. Each boll weighs only three grams. How many bolls are there in two or three hundred jin of cotton! How many bolls are there in 82,000 mu of cotton fields! Men and women are encouraging each other, we cannot stop! If we stop, time will slip away. Everyone is trying to find ways to increase the speed of cotton picking. We cannot stay on yesterday's figures! Otherwise, when will we be able to pick all 82,000 mu of cotton? We must get the cotton into the warehouse as soon as possible. By then, even if it snows heavily, we don't have to worry. We cannot let a single boll of cotton fall to the ground. Every boll must enter the warehouse. This is the call of the Party and the League, this is the duty of every cotton picker. They all know that our motherland still has to buy cotton from abroad. If we harvest half a jin less per mu on our own land, it will be an alarming figure for 82,000 mu of cotton fields.

A sense of collective honor is inspiring every cotton picker. When picking the first batch of cotton, the soldiers of the third company of the Wulawusu Farm could not break through the quota of 120 jin. This worried instructor Zhang Ruhun. He thought, the land of the third company is close to the fifth company, and the cotton of the two companies is blooming equally well. Why can Gong Lianzhi of the fifth company pick more than 180 jin? Can we really not catch up with them? He talked to Li Zhancang, the instructor of the fifth company, about mobilizing cotton picking experts to form a shock team and launch a competition to motivate everyone.

At night, Li Zhancang called Gong Lianzhi over and said to her: "We have an important task. We are preparing to organize a shock team to compete with the third company. We need some people who are not afraid of difficulties and have confidence."

"Instructor! I am willing to participate," Gong Lianzhi said with confidence.

The shock teams of the two companies were formed, and the competition began. That day, the cotton picking figures of the two shock teams both increased significantly, and Gong Lianzhi picked 203 jin.

The instructor asked her: "Do you have back pain from being in the field all day?"

"I didn't think about it at all when picking cotton, but I felt it a little when I lay down at night."

"Can you keep going?"

"Back pain is nothing. Would we let a big wind blow the cotton away because of back pain?"

The cotton pickers use this spirit of perseverance to pick up the cotton boll by boll and hand it over to the state. And this year's bumper harvest in the Manas River basin was created by these energetic people with their own hands.

    丰收是怎样得来的
    本报记者　沈石
    新疆维吾尔自治区成立的时候，玛纳斯河流域的男女战士们，献上了他们尊贵的礼物。这礼物，不是锦旗，不是花簇，而是棉桃累累的棉花。
    数一数株上的棉桃：一百五十多颗。
    这样的礼物，表达了战士们高贵的心，它十足地说明，玛纳斯河流域今年又获得了大面积的棉田丰收。
    丰收，带来了紧张愉快的劳动气氛，成千上万的人，从黎明到黄昏，沐浴在一望无边的棉海里，弯着腰，两手不停地采摘。蘑菇湖附近，初次出现了摘棉机。晒花场上，白茫茫一片，那不是天山的积雪，不是海滩上的盐场，而是新摘回的棉花。
    八万二千亩棉田，用苏联先进方法鉴定的产量，每亩平均四百二十斤，这的确值得种棉的人欢欣鼓舞。他们从春末忙到深秋，希望的就是高额丰产，就是为祖国增产更多的粮食和棉花，就是让准噶尔盆地社会主义建设的花朵开得更加灿烂。
    把生荒地变为良田，让棉田吐出千万朵柔软的银星，并不容易。从用砍土镘、二牛抬杠开垦第一块荒地起，到马拉农具、拖拉机、联合收割机、摘棉机纵横在田野里的这段时间，人们忍受过饥寒，操过心，流过汗。在那艰苦的日子里，蘑菇湖附近某部的农场，曾经发生过一桩这样的事：二连的一位战士，把牛槽上的一块木板拿到自己的炕上，连长马国瑞和指导员廉殿邦知道了这事情，立刻把他找来，严肃地对他说：“我们现在耕地，主要靠牛，爱护牛，就是为了生产，你把牛槽上的木板拿走了，难道不想一想今年的生产任务吗？”这位战士听了心中很难受，立刻把木板重新安置在牛槽上。
    今年棉田中耕的时候，这个农场的驾驶员开始使用中耕机，技术还不够熟练。机械耕作队队长赵万池从清早到傍晚，紧跟在中耕机的后面，细心地观察拖拉机怎样牵引中耕机，他看到伤苗、压苗很多，拾了一束回来。正在这个时候，一连的女战士朱洪美来到自己管理的棉田，看到压伤的棉苗，情不自禁地掉下泪来。她拾起一包被压伤的棉苗，跑到机械耕作队，见了赵万池，伤心地说：“队长！你瞧！”赵万池早就考虑伤苗的事了，他把驾驶员找来，指着棉苗，对他们说：“同志们！你们瞧！这是什么？”驾驶员低着头，默不吭声。
    “伤苗是一个严重问题，苗伤的多，它的后果是什么呢？你们想一想。”赵万池接着说。
    驾驶员都明白，苗伤的多，将要影响棉花的产量。可是他们的技术还不够熟练，怎么办呢？正在他们需要帮助的时候，赵万池说出了他在棉田观察的情形，指出由于调整中耕机有毛病，才发生压苗伤苗，他教大家怎样调整中耕机，驾驶员照着他的话去做，压苗伤苗大大减少了。
    赵万池，这位贫农的儿子，从小没有进过学校。保卫延安的时候，他在著名的教导旅，担任电话排排长。电话排的生活，使他酷爱机器。当他被调到机械耕作队，初次接触复杂的农业机械，什么也不懂，队上的驾驶员，也和他一样，都是新手，拖拉机经常停在地里，发动不过来。然而，不懂难不倒他，白天黑夜，赵万池同驾驶员在一起，互相钻研，疲乏了，便躺在荒地上。每当他从睡意朦胧中，听到拖拉机停止了响声，立刻爬起来，帮助驾驶员排除拖拉机发生的故障。有一次，他患疟疾，驾驶员说：“队长：你回去休息好了。”可是他挂念荒地的开垦，怎么能安心回队呢？疟疾发作了，他便躺下来，把大衣盖上，等一阵疟疾过去，他又和驾驶员在一起了。经过刻苦的钻研学习，他已经熟悉机械耕作队各种农业机械的性能和构造了。
    在这个机械耕作队，由于赵万池的鼓励和帮助，驾驶员邓秀善运用“三点成一直线”的道理，创造了播种的瞄准器，使拖拉机牵引播种机播种，行距播得又匀又直。
    在这个机械耕作队，由于赵万池的鼓励和帮助，修理组的钳工陈光俊，把中耕机改装成追肥机，用拖拉机牵引，平均每小时追肥二十一亩。过去使用马拉追肥机，每天最多只能追肥四十五亩。
    是什么使管理棉田的姑娘见到压伤的苗掉下泪来呢？是什么使赵万池疟疾发作还留在地里呢？没有别的，就是他们社会主义建设的高度责任感。是什么使赵万池在短短的三年里熟悉农场现有的农业机械呢？没有别的，就是他不向困难低头的高贵品质，而这种品质，在党多年的教导下，在青化砭、羊马河、蟠龙、沙家店、瓦子街历次战役中早就养成了。
    有了这些可爱的人，祖国的边疆，自然一日千里在改变她的面貌，看那库尔班通古特沙漠南部的边缘，从前只是野生的沙枣林，今天，代替沙枣林的，是长达十多里的棉田。有人把这里称做“沙漠边缘的江南”，这动听的名称，是战士们用双手赢得的。玛纳斯河下游，有一处名叫西戈壁的地方，两年前，还是长满了红柳和骆驼刺的荒地，今年那儿的棉花，有一百零三亩每亩平均产量一千零三十斤，而所谓西戈壁，只不过是习惯的称呼了。
    在这丰收的日子里，农场的人都明白，要在土地冻结以前，把棉花提前拾完，不然，这些棉田的冬耕就要推迟了。不能让拖拉机翻耕冻结的土壤啊！责任感在督促他们，人们带着中午吃的馒头踏进棉田了，新从河南、河北来的初中毕业生也参加拾棉的行列了。露水沾湿了他们的裤脚和衣袖，让太阳升起时把它晒干吧！拾棉能手一天天地多起来了，张式华、宫淑兰……这些从山东来的姑娘，每天拾到三百多斤，宫莲芝、葛桂珍、王洪禄，是乌拉乌苏农场最先每天拾到二百多斤的。
    一天拾两三百斤棉花，做起来并不轻松，一朵花才三克重，两三百斤花，要拾多少朵啊！八万二千亩棉田，又有多少朵啊！男男女女，都在互相鼓励，不能停下来！停下来，时间便溜过去了。大家都在想办法增加拾棉的速度，不能停在昨天的数字上啊！不然，八万二千亩棉花，要等到什么时候才能拾完呢？得早早把棉花收进仓库里，到那时，尽管风雪交加，也不用发愁了。不能让一瓣棉花掉在地里，必须朵朵入仓，这是党和团的号召，这是每个拾棉的应尽的责任。他们都知道，我们的祖国还得向国外购买棉花，如果在自己的土地上，每亩少收半斤花，八万二千亩棉田，将是一笔惊人的数字。
    集体荣誉感在激发每一位拾棉的人，当摘第一遍花的时候，乌拉乌苏农场三连的战士们突破不了一百二十斤的定额，这可叫指导员张如翰发愁了。他想，三连的地靠近五连，两个连的棉花开得一样齐，为什么五连的宫莲芝能拾到一百八十多斤呢？难道真的赶不上他们吗？他同五连的指导员李占仓谈发动拾花能手组成突击队，展开竞赛，来带动大家。
    夜里，李占仓把宫莲芝找来，对她说：“咱们有个重要任务，准备组织突击队同三连竞赛，需要一些不怕困难和有信心的人。”
    “指导员！我愿意参加。”宫莲芝有信心地说。
    两个连的突击队组成了，竞赛开始了，这一天，两个突击队的拾花数字都显著地增加了，而宫莲芝，拾到了二百零三斤。
    指导员问她：“你整天待在地里，是不是腰痛？”
    “拾花的时候，根本没有想到，可是晚上躺下来，才有些微儿感觉。”
    “能坚持下去吗？”
    “腰痛算不了什么，难道因为腰痛，让一场大风把棉花?跑吗？”
    拾棉的人就是用这种坚忍的精神，把棉花一朵一朵地拾起来缴给国家的。而玛纳斯河流域今年的大丰收，就是这些朝气勃勃的人，凭着他们的双手创造出来的。
