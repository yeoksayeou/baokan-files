The agricultural production corps stationed in Xinjiang of the People's Liberation Army, over the past few years, has constructed many large-scale irrigation and drainage projects in the Manas River, Kongnais River, Yanqi River, Kaidu River basins, and the Hami area. Snow water from the Tianshan Mountains has been diverted to the Gobi grasslands, which have been arid for many years. In addition to irrigating over one million mu of farmland, large-scale alkali leaching work has been carried out. About 300,000 mu of saline-alkali land has now been improved. In Yanqi and Hami, on the wastelands that were barren all year round in the past, southern rice has been planted and harvested abundantly every year. In Aksu, large-scale cotton cultivation has begun. Production bases have been established on various types of saline-alkali land, and many large-scale irrigated farms have been established.

Under the guidance of technical experts, the irrigation technology of the agricultural production corps has also been greatly improved. The reclamation area no longer uses the method of flood irrigation. Small furrow irrigation is used for wheat, and furrow irrigation and trickle irrigation are used for cultivated crops such as cotton, corn, and sorghum. This irrigation method, in addition to maintaining the soil in a lasting loose state and promoting crop growth, can also prevent the rise of the groundwater level and soil salinization. This year, twelve irrigation experiment stations have been established in the Hami, Aksu, Urumqi, and Manas River reclamation areas to conduct crop cultivation and irrigation experiments. This will play a significant role in rational water use and prevention of soil salinization.

With the development of production, the corps is carrying out planned land reclamation and alkali treatment work. This year, scientific alkali leaching experiments have been carried out in the three areas with more severe saline-alkali conditions in Hami, Aksu, and Yanqi. Combining past experience, the relationship between the degree and nature of soil salinity, soil structure, groundwater, and other natural factors are systematically studied to gain experience from this and solve the problem of large-scale alkali treatment. At the same time, a large number of machines and manpower have been invested in land reclamation and alkali treatment. By mid-September, more than 190,000 mu of wasteland had been reclaimed. It is estimated that the task of reclaiming 600,000 mu can be completed before the freeze-up this year. Most of these newly reclaimed wastelands must be artificially treated for alkali. Generally, the results can meet the requirements. In a certain unit of the Aksu reclamation area, the results of testing on the same piece of land showed that the saline-alkali land, which originally contained 3.25% sodium chloride, only contained 0.05% sodium chloride after soaking and washing, making it suitable for cultivation.

In the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, there are boundless fertile original wastelands. It is estimated that the arable area of these lands is more than 110 million mu, which is about five times the total cultivated area of Xinjiang this year. Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, planned surveying and reclamation work on these lands is underway. In the near future, this place will become the country's cotton and grain production base.

    向盐碱荒地作斗争的新疆农业生产部队
    邢正宣
    人民解放军驻新疆的农业生产部队，几年来在玛纳斯河、巩乃斯河、焉耆河、开都河等流域和哈密地区，修建了许多规模巨大的灌溉和排水工程。把天山的雪水引到长年干旱的戈壁草原上，除灌溉一百多万亩农田外，并进行了大规模的洗碱工作。现在已约有三十万亩的盐碱地获得了改造。在焉耆、哈密过去终年荒芜的荒原上，长起了南方的水稻，年年获得丰收。在阿克苏已经开始大量栽培棉花作物。在各种不同的盐碱地上，建立起了生产基地，建立了许多规模巨大的灌溉农场。
    农业生产部队在技术专家的指导下，灌溉技术也有了很大的改进。垦区已不采用大水漫灌的方法，小麦实行小畦灌溉，中耕作物如棉花、玉米、高粱等实行沟灌和细流灌溉。这样的灌溉方法，除保持土壤持久的疏松状态、促进作物的生长外，还能防止地下水位上升和土壤盐碱化。今年，在哈密、阿克苏、乌鲁木齐、玛纳斯河等垦区建立了十二个灌溉实验站，进行农作物的栽培灌溉试验，这对合理用水、防止土壤盐碱化将起很大的作用。
    随着生产的发展，部队正在进行有计划的开荒治碱工作。今年，在哈密、阿克苏、焉耆三处盐碱较严重的地区，进行了科学的洗碱试验，结合以往的经验，系统地研究土壤的盐碱程度、性质、土壤结构、地下水等自然因素的关系。从这里取得经验，解决大面积治碱问题。同时投入了大批的机械和人力，进行开荒治碱。到九月中旬，已开垦荒地十九万多亩。预计在今年封冻前，可完成六十万亩垦荒的任务。这些新垦的荒地，大部都须经过人工治碱。一般效果都能达到要求。阿克苏垦区某部，在同一块地检验的结果：原来含氯化钠百分之三点二五的盐碱地，经过泡洗后，氯化钠含量只占到百分之○点○五，已适宜于耕作了。
    在天山南北，有无边无际的肥美的原始荒地。据估计，这些土地的可耕面积在一亿一千万亩以上，约为今年新疆总耕播面积的五倍。在党和人民政府的领导下，对这些土地有计划的勘测和开垦工作正在进行，不久的将来，这里将变成祖国的棉花和粮食产地。
