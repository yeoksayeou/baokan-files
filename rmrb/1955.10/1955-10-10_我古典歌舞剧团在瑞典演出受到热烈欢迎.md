Xinhua News Agency

    The Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Drama Troupe began its performance tour in Sweden on the 5th. This performance aroused great interest from the Swedish art circles and all walks of life, becoming the center of attention for the residents of Stockholm.
    As early as October 3rd, before all the troupe members had arrived, ticket sales had already begun. The tickets for the planned three-day performance at the Swedish Royal Theatre were quickly sold out. In response to the enthusiastic requests from all sectors of the Swedish people, the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Drama Troupe decided to extend the performance period by three days, but the tickets were quickly sold out again.
    People in the Swedish theater circles said that audiences in Stockholm rarely show such great interest and such a warm welcome to Chinese classical opera and dance. From the premiere on the 5th, people came to the Royal Theatre an hour before the start of each performance, some repeatedly watching the program with color pictures, and some excitedly discussing the upcoming performance.
    The Chinese troupe's continuous performances have received widespread praise from Swedish newspaper reviews. "Stockholm Daily News" said that the performance's "success is huge, and the cheers and applause reached an extent that no one had anticipated."
    "Morning Post" said: "When the troupe premiered at the Royal Theatre, people were convinced that the art of Peking Opera will leave a deep impression in Sweden. For those who dream that drama can achieve a perfect performance in which language and action, tone and color, song and dance, people and curtains are harmonized, it is a rich and inexhaustible source of inspiration."
    "Swedish Daily News" believes that watching a performance by the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Drama Troupe is a "perfect and highly aesthetic experience." It said:
  “What is it in Chinese classical opera and dance that can attract such completely unfamiliar European audiences? There are many things... expressive imitation and mime elements,... bodies trained in martial arts are flexible in rhythm and movement, the body seems to be moving according to the principle of being lighter than air;... rich poetry; strong comedy; tension and vitality; and finally, the strange musical accompaniment."
    "Daily News" said that Peking Opera showed "the Chinese people's clear and open spirit of adopting a positive attitude towards life and a pleasant humor." "Chinese actors are wonderful artists, they are well-trained warriors and magicians, and at the same time, they are actors with strong personalities."
    "Expressen" believes that the reason why Peking Opera is so clear and has dramatic power is because it is a people's drama. It believes that one of the lessons worth learning from it is to combine traditional things with the people's preferences. "Expressen" said: "The effect of the play 'The Drunken Concubine' is overwhelming." "No art can tell us about life more simply and clearly than this."
    Sweden's "Daily Morning News" said that the entire performance was "a feast for the eyes." It believes that Europeans will benefit from the visit of the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Drama Troupe. It said: "We are a little too easily complacent, always thinking that culture is primarily our thing, but the performance of Chinese classical opera and dance tells us that they have their own views on artistic issues and the meaning of art and have their own ways of expressing them."
    "New Daily" commented on the performance of the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Drama Troupe, saying: "Rarely do we hear such natural applause when the curtain opens, and rarely do we hear such great admiration and applause when the curtain falls." "We thank the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Drama Troupe headed by Chu Tunan, because Stockholm can also have the opportunity to learn and understand first-class classical drama art."

    我古典歌舞剧团在瑞典演出受到热烈欢迎
    中国古典歌舞剧团五日开始了在瑞典的访问演出。这次演出引起了瑞典文艺界和各方面人士的巨大兴趣，成了斯德哥尔摩居民注意的中心。
    早在十月三日剧团人员还没有全部到达前，就已开始了售票。原订为期三天的在瑞典皇家剧院演出的戏票，很快就被抢购一空。应瑞典各界人民热情的要求，中国古典歌舞剧团决定延长演期三天，但是戏票很快又被买光了。
    瑞典戏剧界人士说，斯德哥尔摩的观众很少表现出像对中国古典歌舞这样大的兴趣和这样热烈的欢迎。从五日首次公演起，每天开演前一小时人们就纷纷来到皇家剧院，有的在反复观看印有彩色图片的节目单，有的在兴奋地议论着即将看到的演出。
    中国剧团连日的演出受到瑞典报纸评论的广泛赞扬。“斯德哥尔摩日报”说，演出的“成功是巨大的，欢呼声和鼓掌声达到了谁也不曾预料到的程度。”
    “晨报”说：“当剧团在皇家剧院首次演出后，人们确信京剧的艺术将在瑞典留下很深的印象。对于那些梦想戏剧能够达到语言和动作、音调和色彩、歌和舞、人和布幕相调和的圆满演出的人来说，它就是丰富的永不枯竭的灵感的泉源。”
    “瑞典日报”认为观看中国古典歌舞剧团一次演出就是一次“完美的高度的审美经历”。它说：
  “中国古典歌舞剧中的什么东西能这样吸引住绝对陌生的欧洲观众呢？那有很多东西……富有表现力的模仿和哑剧的因素，……受过武术锻炼的身体在节奏上和运动中是灵活的，躯体似乎是按照比空气还轻的原则在活动；……丰富的诗意；强烈的喜剧性；紧张与活力；最后是奇特的音乐伴奏。”
    “每日新闻”说，京戏表现了“中国人对生活采取肯定态度的明朗开阔的气魄和愉快的幽默”。“中国演员是奇妙的艺术家，他们是训练有素的武士和魔术家，同时又是有坚强性格的演员”。
    “快报”认为京剧之所以如此明确和有戏剧力量，就是因为它是人民的戏剧。它认为值得从中吸取的教训之一就是要把传统的东西和人民的喜好结合起来。“快报”说：“贵妃醉酒”一剧的效果是压倒一切的。“任何艺术也不能比这更朴素、更明明白白地把生活告诉我们了”。
    瑞典“每日晨报”说，整个演出是“大饱眼福”。它认为欧洲人将从中国古典歌舞剧团的访问中得到益处。它说：“我们有些太容易自满了，总以为文化首先是我们的东西，而中国古典歌舞的演出却告诉我们，他们对艺术问题和艺术的意义有他们自己的看法并且有他们自己的表达方式。”
    “新日报”评论中国古典歌舞剧团的演出说：“很少听到幕布揭开时有这样自然的鼓掌声，很少听到幕布降下时有这样大的羡慕叫好声”。“我们感谢以楚图南为首的中国古典歌舞剧团，因为斯德哥尔摩也能得到学习和了解第一流古典戏剧艺术的机会。”
