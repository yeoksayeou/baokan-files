    Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 23rd: According to TASS, the United Nations Disarmament Commission held a meeting on the 21st at the suggestion of the Soviet representative.

    The Soviet representative, Sobolev, spoke first. He said that the Soviet delegation suggested convening this meeting of the Disarmament Commission to discuss the report of the Disarmament Subcommittee and to draft the Disarmament Commission's report to the United Nations General Assembly. Given that the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly has the item of the Disarmament Commission's report on its agenda, the commission must submit this report without delay.

    Sobolev pointed out that the disarmament negotiation process has reached a stage where it is necessary to know the opinion of the United Nations General Assembly on this issue. This necessity is primarily due to the situation within the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee. The Subcommittee has not taken any concrete steps during the period since the Geneva meeting of the heads of the four governments to formulate a disarmament system acceptable to all, nor has it made any progress in this work.

    Sobolev pointed out that the Disarmament Subcommittee had a real possibility of making progress in formulating a disarmament system acceptable to all. The Soviet government's proposal as early as May 10 had brought the views of all parties so close that it was possible for the Subcommittee to reach agreement on some issues. He pointed out that the Soviet Union had accepted the proposals of the United States, Britain and France regarding the level of armed forces and the reduction of conventional armaments in two stages, and had also accepted the Anglo-French proposal on the effective date of the ban on atomic weapons. As for the issue of supervision, the attitudes of all parties have also approached to a certain extent. The Soviet Union believes that disarmament must be implemented under international supervision. The May 10 proposal addressed the issue of international supervision and proposed a new approach to the establishment of observation posts. Therefore, the attitudes of the members of the Subcommittee have come closer on the basic components of the disarmament issue, rather than on some individual aspects of it. It seems that this convergence of attitudes should be affirmed in order to lay the foundation for further work, in the course of which it will be possible to clarify all the details of the necessary agreement on the formulation of a disarmament plan acceptable to all.

    Sobolev said that this has not been done in the past. The reason for this is the attitude adopted by the US representative in the subcommittee. The US representative circumvented discussion of proposals for measures to reduce armaments and ban atomic weapons, and only said that the US "reserved" its past attitude on these issues. The US representative has in fact embarked on the road of refusing to make decisions on the issues of reducing armaments and banning atomic weapons.

    Sobolev pointed out that there is a definite possibility of reaching agreement on these basic issues of disarmament at present. In view of this, it is natural to ask: why is the United Nations doing nothing on this issue? The United Nations Disarmament Commission should submit its report to the United Nations General Assembly without delay, so that the United Nations General Assembly can begin discussing the issue of disarmament as soon as possible.

    The representatives of the Disarmament Commission who spoke next at the meeting opposed discussing the report of the Disarmament Subcommittee and submitting the report of the Disarmament Commission to the United Nations General Assembly at this time.

    Then, Sobolev spoke again. He reiterated the basic principles of the Soviet Union's May 10 proposal and suggested that the next meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Commission be held on October 26. This suggestion was not supported by other delegations.

    The date of the next meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Commission is undetermined.

    索波列夫在联合国裁军委员会会议上发言
    新华社二十三日讯　据塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：根据苏联代表的建议，联合国裁军委员会二十一日举行了会议。
    苏联代表索波列夫第一个发言。他说，苏联代表团建议召开这次裁军委员会会议来讨论裁军小组委员会的报告和拟定裁军委员会提交联合国大会的报告。鉴于在联合国大会第十届会议的议程上列有裁军委员会的报告这一项，委员会必须毫不迟延地提出这项报告。
    索波列夫指出，目前在裁军的谈判过程中已经达到了这样一个阶段，就是现在又到了必须知道联合国大会对这个问题的意见的时候了。这种必要性首先是由于联合国裁军委员会小组委员会内发生的情形造成的。小组委员会在四国政府首脑日内瓦会议以后的这段时期中没有作出什么具体步骤来拟定一个大家都可以接受的裁军制度，也没有在这一工作上取得任何进展。
    索波列夫指出，裁军小组委员会本来是有实际的可能来在拟定一个大家都可以接受的裁军制度方面取得进展的。苏联政府早在五月十日提出的建议就已经使各方的观点达到这样接近的程度，以至小组委员会有可能在一些问题上达成协议。他指出，苏联已经接受了美国、英国和法国提出的关于武装部队水平以及分两个阶段裁减常规军备的建议，在禁止原子武器的禁令的生效时间的问题上，苏联也接受了英法的建议。至于监督问题，各方的态度也有了一定程度的接近。苏联认为必须在国际的监督下实行裁军。五月十日的建议对解决国际监督的问题并且提出了关于设立监察所的新办法。因此，小组委员会委员的态度已经在裁军问题的基本构成部分上，而不是它的某些个别方面接近起来。看来，态度的这种接近应该确定下来，以便为进一步的工作打下基础，在今后工作的过程中有可能把有关拟订大家可以接受的裁军方案的必要协议的一切细节明确起来。
    索波列夫说，但是，过去却没有这样做。所以如此，是由于美国代表在小组委员会内所采取的态度的结果。美国代表规避讨论有关裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施的建议，而只说美国在这些问题上“保留”过去所采取的态度。美国代表实际上走上了在裁减军备和禁止原子武器的问题上拒绝作出决定的道路。
    索波列夫指出，目前在这些关于裁军的基本问题上达成协议是存在着肯定的可能性的。有鉴于此，自然要问：联合国为什么在这一个问题上毫无作为呢？联合国裁军委员会应该毫不迟延地向联合国大会提出自己的报告，以便使联合国大会有可能尽早开始讨论裁军问题。
    在会上接着发言的裁军委员会的代表都反对现在讨论裁军小组委员会的报告和向联合国大会提出裁军委员会的报告。
    接着，索波列夫再次发言。他把苏联五月十日的建议的基本原则重新阐明一遍，并且建议联合国裁军委员会下一次会议在十月二十六日举行。这一建议没有得到其他代表团的支持。
    联合国裁军委员会下次会议的日期未定。
