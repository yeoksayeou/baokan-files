    Introduction to Key Members of the Soviet Artists Delegation
    Great Singer P. Amiranashvili
    The name of P. Amiranashvili, People's Artist of the Soviet Union and one of the country’s great singers, is widely known throughout the Soviet Union.

      He came from a working-class family and was himself a worker. While working in a mine, he joined an amateur choir. The choir director immediately noticed the young man's musical talent and keen ear. Amiranashvili quickly became the choir's lead singer and soloist.

    When the choir performed at an amateur theater festival, the young soloist was praised with a certificate by the festival judging committee. Famous musicians who heard Amiranashvili sing introduced him to study at the Tbilisi Conservatory. During the entrance examination, the young singer successfully performed several Georgian folk songs and some lyrical songs from Georgian and Russian classical operas, and was admitted.

    In 1929, Amiranashvili graduated with honors from the vocal department of the Conservatory, where he was taught by O. Shuriqina. During a competition, he was accepted as a soloist at the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theater named after the great musician and Georgian composer, Zakharia Paliashvili.

    His tireless and rigorous self-discipline, his desire to perfect his vocal skills, and his profound labor in creating concrete and realistic images in opera are the hallmarks of the artist-singer Amiranashvili's creative path. He is a baritone with a beautiful, soft, and mellow tone quality. On the stage of the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theater, he has played thirty-five roles in operas by Georgian, Russian, and foreign composers.

    During the Georgian Art Festival in Moscow in 1937, Amiranashvili's performances at the Bolshoi Theater were a great success. After the end of the art festival, he was invited by the Bolshoi Theater to participate in performances of A. Rubinstein's opera "The Demon" and G. Verdi's opera "Rigoletto."

    Amiranashvili also made guest appearances on the stage of the Kirov Opera and Ballet Theater in Leningrad. He has held concerts in many cities throughout the Soviet Union.

    Even as a famous singer, Amiranashvili continued to perfect his skills. He studied for more than a year with Sergei Migai, People's Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and professor at the Moscow Conservatory.

    For his outstanding contributions to the development of opera art, Amiranashvili was awarded the title of People's Artist of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin. He was also awarded the title of Stalin Prize Laureate for creating the image of Tariel in the Georgian opera "The Tale of Tariel" by composer Shalva Mshvelidze.

    苏联艺术家代表团主要成员介绍
    大歌唱家普·阿米拉纳什维利
    苏联人民演员、全国的大歌唱家之一普·阿米拉纳什维利的名字在苏维埃国家是普遍闻名的。
      他出身于工人的家庭，自己过去也是工人。当他在一个矿山里作工的时期，他参加了一个业余合唱队。合唱队的指挥立刻注意到这个青年的音乐天才和灵敏的听觉。阿米拉纳什维利很快地就成了合唱队的领唱者和独唱者。
    当合唱队在业余剧团会演上演唱的时候，年青的独唱者曾由会演评判委员会予以奖状表扬。听到阿米拉纳什维利演唱的著名的音乐家们介绍他进梯比里斯音乐学院学习。在考试的时候，年青的歌唱家成功地演唱了几支格鲁吉亚民歌、格鲁吉亚和俄罗斯古典歌剧中的一些抒情歌曲，并被准许入学。
    一九二九年阿米拉纳什维利以优良的成绩毕业于音乐学院声乐系奥·舒里京娜所教授的那一班。在比赛的时候他被接纳为以格鲁吉亚作曲家——大音乐家萨哈利亚·帕里阿什维里为名的梯比里斯歌舞剧院的独唱者。
    对自己孜孜不倦的严格要求，使自己的声乐修养达到完善的渴望，对创造歌剧中的确凿的、真实的形象的深刻劳动，是艺术家—歌唱家阿米拉纳什维利创作道路的特征。他是一个具有优美的、柔和的圆润音质的男中音，在梯比里斯歌舞剧院的舞台上曾经扮演过格鲁吉亚、俄罗斯和外国作曲家的歌剧中的三十五个角色。
    在一九三七年格鲁吉亚艺术旬中，阿米拉纳什维利在莫斯科大剧院的舞台上的表演获得极大的成功。艺术旬结束以后他被大剧院邀请参加了阿·鲁宾斯坦的歌剧“恶魔”和德·维尔第的歌剧“利果莱托”的演出。
    阿米拉纳什维利也在列宁格勒基洛夫歌舞剧院的舞台上作过访问演出。他在苏维埃国家的许多城市中都举行过音乐会。
    已经是著名的歌唱家的阿米拉纳什维利继续使自己的技艺达到完善。他在俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国人民演员、莫斯科音乐学院教授谢尔盖·米加依那里学习了一年多。
    由于在发展歌剧艺术上的卓越功绩，阿米拉纳什维利被授予苏联人民演员的称号，并获得列宁勋章。由于创造了作曲家沙勒维·姆什维里捷的格鲁吉亚歌剧“塔里艾尔的故事”的塔里艾尔的形象，他获得了斯大林奖金获得者的称号。
