To the Editor:

The waste of oil products in the distillation workshop of Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 5 is extremely serious. In the fifty days from the end of May to July 19th this year, there were nineteen oil spill accidents, large and small. The exact amount of gasoline, kerosene, fuel oil, and lamp oil wasted in these oil spill accidents has not yet been calculated; however, in one accident alone, on July 13th, more than four tons of light automotive gasoline flowed out from a branch of the water collecting tank. Although some was recovered, the loss still amounted to more than 1,000 yuan. The high frequency of oil spill accidents in this workshop has been consistent. In the fourth quarter of last year, a large amount of Central Asian crude oil, transported from afar, was wasted, causing crude oil to flood into the staff and workers' dormitories. However, the leaders of the distillation workshop have long turned a blind eye to this situation, and sometimes even deliberately conceal oil spill accidents. For example, on June 4th, the oil from the oil inspection pool of the distillation workshop flowed into a culvert. The workshop technician suggested to the director, Zheng Jiahong, that the oil should be recovered quickly, but Zheng Jiahong did not adopt this suggestion and watched as the gasoline ran away. Later, when the dispatcher investigated this matter, they instead said that the oil was not spilled by the distillation workshop until the factory director and the Party committee secretary came to inspect, and then he was forced to admit his mistake.

The chaotic phenomenon in the production of the distillation workshop is also very serious. The original records of the workshop have always been relatively chaotic. The tank gauging records often only have the oil height but not the tonnage of oil. The tonnage of various products in the shift reports is often greater than the crude oil processing volume. As a result, it is difficult to grasp the real production situation. In addition, the three shifts operate inconsistently and lack a dedicated person in charge system, resulting in abnormal production and poor product quality, which seriously affects the completion of the product plan. In June, three of the five kinds of finished and semi-finished products in the distillation workshop did not meet the quality requirements. The backlog of lamp oil alone was more than 2,000 tons, making it impossible to complete the sales plan. The phenomenon of sending the wrong oil products also occurs frequently. On June 19th, heavy lamp oil was once sent out as light lamp oil. Sometimes the gasoline and lamp oil they send out contains water and is not dehydrated. The refining workshop has repeatedly raised objections, but they are slow to solve the problem and instead say, "We have more water gauges in our workshop, and we don't know where the water comes from."

This serious waste of oil products and chaotic production is caused by the irresponsibility of the leaders of the distillation workshop towards state property. They also often fail to implement the instructions of the leadership. For example, when the factory director instructed to investigate the causes of oil spill accidents and deal with them in a timely manner, they believed that "the people in the workshop are loyal and reliable, and there will be no problems," so they were unwilling to implement it. Instead, they replied, "The reason for the oil spill is very simple, that is, the workers' technology is low"; "Some are deliberately released, but it does not count as an accident." For example, not long ago, the dispatching room asked them to move wax-containing oil to the cracking workshop. A shift foreman in the workshop said that "the director has not instructed us to move." The dispatching room had to issue a dispatch order book stamped by the factory director, but they still did not accept the order. Later, the cracking workshop reported this matter to the factory director, and the problem was solved, but the time to move the oil had been delayed by six hours, seriously affecting production.

We believe that Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 5 should check the work of the distillation workshop, severely criticize the irresponsible attitude of the leaders of this workshop, and immediately investigate the responsibility for the oil spill accidents.

    东北石油五厂蒸馏车间生产混乱浪费严重编辑同志：
    东北石油五厂蒸馏车间浪费油品的现象十分严重。今年五月底到七月十九日的五十天中，就发生了大小跑油事故十九次。在这些跑油事故中究竟浪费了多少汽油、煤油、燃料油和灯油，目前还没有统计数字；其中仅七月十三日发生的一次轻质车用汽油从澈水槽支路外流的事故，就跑掉了四吨多汽油，虽然收回一部分，损失仍然达一千多元。这个车间跑油事故多的情况是一贯的，去年第四季度曾浪费了大量从远方运来的中亚细亚原油，使原油一直泛滥到职工宿舍里去。但是，蒸馏车间的领导人员对这种情况长期来熟视无睹，有时还故意隐瞒跑油事故。例如，六月四日蒸馏车间检油池的油流入暗沟，车间技术员向主任郑嘉鸿建议赶快把这些油收回来，郑嘉鸿不采纳这个建议，眼看着让汽油跑掉。后来调度员追查这件事情，他们反而说油不是蒸馏车间跑掉的，直到厂长、党委书记来检查，他才被迫认错。
    蒸馏车间生产中的混乱现象也很严重。车间的原始记录一直比较混乱，油罐检尺记录往往只有油高，而没有油的吨数，班报表中各种产品的吨数也常常大于原油处理量。这样，就很难掌握真实的生产情况。加上三班操作不统一，缺乏专人负责制度，结果使得生产很不正常，产品质量低劣，严重地影响了产品计划的完成。六月间，蒸馏车间五种成品和半成品中有三种产品不合质量要求，仅灯油一项就积压了两千多吨，使销售计划不能完成。送错油品的现象也经常发生，六月十九日就曾经把重灯油当作轻灯油送出去。有时他们送出的汽油、灯油带水而不进行脱水，精制车间一再提出意见，他们迟迟不解决，反而说：“我们车间水尺多了，水怎么来的我们也不知道。”
    这种严重的浪费油品和生产混乱的现象，是由于蒸馏车间领导人员对国家财产不负责任所造成的。他们还经常不执行领导方面的指示。例如，当厂长指示要对跑油事故查究原因和及时处理的时候，他们认为“车间里这些人忠实可靠，不会有什么问题”，就不愿执行，反而答复说：“跑油的原因很简单，就是工人的技术低”；“有的是故意放掉的，但不算事故”。又如不久以前调度室让他们往裂化车间移动含腊油，车间的一个值班工长说是“主任没有指示不能移”。调度室只好下达由厂长盖章的调度命令书，但他们仍然不接受命令。后来裂化车间把这件事情反映给厂长，问题才解决了，但是移动油的时间已经拖迟了六小时，严重地影响了生产。
    我们认为，东北石油五厂应该检查蒸馏车间的工作，对这个车间领导人员的这种不负责任态度进行严厉的批评，并且立即查究跑油事故的责任。
