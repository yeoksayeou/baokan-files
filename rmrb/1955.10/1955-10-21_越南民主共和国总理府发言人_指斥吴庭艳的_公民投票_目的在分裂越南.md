Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 19th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the spokesperson of the Prime Minister's Office of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam said on October 18th when meeting with reporters from Vietnam News Agency that the "referendum" that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is preparing to hold on October 23rd is merely a farce and cannot be called a "referendum."

The spokesperson said: The purpose of this conspiracy is "to legitimize a fascist regime of a pro-American clique, concentrate all power in the hands of Ngo Dinh Diem, and strengthen the Ngo Dinh Diem government to make it an effective tool of the American imperialists to realize the American imperialists' conspiracy to divide Vietnam, exclusively control South Vietnam, turn this region into a colony and war base of the United States, and undermine the Geneva Accords, the consolidation of peace, and the unification of Vietnam."

The spokesperson pointed out that this "referendum" is not scheduled to be conducted according to democratic methods or under democratic supervision, but is merely an abuse of the people's name. The spokesperson said that because this "referendum" farce violates the ardent wishes and fundamental interests of the Vietnamese people, all the people of Vietnam, from south to north, oppose it. The spokesperson pointed out: "If the people were able to freely express their opinions, such a regime would certainly not be able to stand."

    越南民主共和国总理府发言人
    指斥吴庭艳的“公民投票”目的在分裂越南
    新华社河内十九日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国总理府发言人十月十八日在接见越南通讯社记者时说，吴庭艳集团准备在十月二十三日举行的“公民投票”只是一出滑稽戏，称不上“公民投票”。
    发言人说：这个阴谋的目的是“使一个亲美集团的法西斯政权合法化，把一切权力都集中到吴庭艳的手中，强化吴庭艳政府使之成为美帝国主义者的一个有效工具，实现美帝国主义者的这种阴谋，即分裂越南，独占对南越的控制，把这个地区变成美国的一个殖民地和战争基地，破坏日内瓦协议，破坏和平的巩固和越南的统一”。
    发言人指出，这种“公民投票”并不预定按照民主方法或者在民主监督之下来进行，而不过是滥用人民的名义。发言人说，由于这种“公民投票”的滑稽戏违反越南人民的热烈的愿望和根本的利益，全越南从南到北的人民都反对它。这位发言人指出：“如果人民能够自由地表示他们的意见，这样一种政权肯定是站不住脚的。”
