Xinhua News Agency, October 14th – Railway loaders and unloaders at more than thirty stations in Beijing load dozens of train cars of industrial products for external shipment every day. In the recent two to three months, a total of more than 5,700 tons of eleven types of goods, including agricultural tools, agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, cotton cloth, matches, soap, knitwear, and woolen textiles, have been shipped from Beijing to rural areas in North China, an increase of more than 70% compared to the same period last year. The Beijing Company of China National General Merchandise Company plans to ship more than 4,000 types of goods in the fourth quarter.

Currently, many state-owned companies, factories, and handicraft production cooperatives in Beijing have organized visiting promotion teams to go to rural areas in North China, Northwest China, and other regions to investigate and study the needs of farmers, in order to further improve the supply of materials to rural areas.

This newspaper reports that state-owned commercial purchasing and supply stations in Tianjin are allocating large quantities of industrial products to meet the needs of the peak season market in rural areas after the autumn harvest. According to incomplete statistics, from August to October 5th this year, eight units, including the general merchandise, cotton yarn and cloth, chemical, hardware, and pharmaceutical purchasing and supply stations, and the petroleum wholesale station, have shipped more than 70,000 tons of industrial products to Northeast China, Northwest China, and Henan, Anhui, and other regions.

The quantity and variety of industrial products allocated to rural areas by various purchasing and supply stations this year are greater than last year. The general merchandise purchasing and supply station has not only increased the supply of major commodities such as towels, socks, clothing, rubber shoes, handcart tires, and cotton knitwear, but has also added daily-use small general merchandise such as thimbles and snap fasteners that sell well in rural areas. The cotton yarn and cloth purchasing and supply station has shipped more than 150 new types of fabrics to rural areas compared to last year. The cultural supplies purchasing and supply station shipped more than 5,000 tons of cultural supplies to Jiangsu, Anhui, and other regions in September, an increase of two to three times compared to the same period last year. The pharmaceutical purchasing and supply station also increased the amount of prepared medicines shipped to various regions in the third quarter compared to the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 13th – Representatives from state-owned general merchandise companies and cultural supplies companies in various regions have come to Shanghai to replenish the commodities needed for the peak season in the rural market.

Representatives from various regions reported to the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China National General Merchandise Company on the prosperous scene of the rural peak season market after the autumn harvest, and requested that they be supplied with more commodities as soon as possible. The representative from Hunan Province reflected that the early and late rice crops in the province have had bumper harvests. The sales volume of general merchandise in the fifteen counties along Dongting Lake in early August suddenly increased three to four times compared to late July. Anhui Province, which suffered from major floods last year, has also generally had a bumper harvest this year. After the autumn harvest, farmers first purchase clothing for women and children, requiring a lot of bright red wool yarn, small and medium-sized children's undershirts, and floral women's undershirts. The representative from Jiangsu Province reflected that after the bumper harvests of cotton and early rice, the problem of material supply needs to be solved urgently. A certain market town in a cotton-producing area sold 200 bicycles in mid-September, and many farmers paid to pre-order them, with 600 bicycles already pre-ordered by the end of September. The representative from Fujian Province reflected that the province not only had a bumper harvest of rice, but also an even greater bumper harvest of fruits such as longans, oranges, and pomelos, requesting Shanghai to replenish them with large quantities of wool yarn, towels, batteries, cardigan undershirts, and enamel mugs, and also requesting that they be able to pick up the goods in advance.

At the fourth-quarter replenishment meeting recently held by the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China National General Merchandise Company, the value of the commodities replenished by wholesale stations and grass-roots stores of general merchandise companies in various regions reached more than 10 million yuan.
