Comrade Lai Ruoyu's Opening Address at the First National Workers' Games

Dear worker athletes, comrades, and guests:

The First National Workers' Games is now officially open in our nation's capital!

The convening of this National Workers' Games is a pioneering event in our country's history. It fully demonstrates the superiority of our people's democratic system and fully demonstrates the care of the Party and the government for the material and cultural lives of our broad working people. The achievements already made in the sports competitions in various regions indicate that the call of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao for the development of sports is precisely the demand and aspiration of the broad masses. On behalf of the Presidium of the Congress and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, I extend warm congratulations to all the athletes and express my gratitude to all the referees and all the working comrades.

The purpose of convening the First National Workers' Games is to review the achievements of workers' sports since the founding of New China, to learn from the experience of the Soviet Union in developing workers' sports, to improve the technical level of workers' sports, and to further promote sports in factories, mines, enterprises, and government offices, thereby strengthening the physique of all employees and ensuring the successful completion of our country's First Five-Year Plan.

The Chinese working class must not only have a high degree of political consciousness and cultural and technical level, but also a healthy physique in order to victoriously shoulder the glorious task of completing the First Five-Year Plan. Facts have proven that carrying out sports activities is indeed a most active and effective way to enhance the people's physique. Moreover, sports is also an important way to cultivate courage, perseverance, collectivism, and communist morality. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao are very concerned about the development of people's sports, and believe that this is an important political task of the Party.

The trade union is a communist school. Trade union organizations at all levels, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the government, should earnestly prepare the necessary conditions for the broad masses of workers to engage in physical exercise and guide them to engage in regular sports activities and exercises. In particular, through this sports event, we must greatly advance the development of workers' sports in our country.

All athlete comrades, at this sports event, I hope that you will demonstrate the communist moral character that the working class should have, demonstrate a high degree of communist sportsmanship, and overcome the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie. I hope that you will not only become lovers of sports, but also organizers and promoters of workers' sports, so that workers' sports can be widely developed. I wish you excellent achievements in production, in learning, and in sports.

Comrades, I would also like to especially mention that Comrade N.N. Romanov, Chairman of the Sports Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, was invited to participate in this congress, and the Soviet Trade Union was invited to send its sports delegation to participate in this congress. Their arrival will have a long-term and significant impact on the development of sports in our country. We express our warm welcome and heartfelt thanks for their presence.

For the health and happiness of the people of China and the Soviet Union, we wish the athletes of China and the Soviet Union excellent achievements in sports!

As we hold the National Workers' Games here, we wish our country's First Five-Year Plan a victory, and we wish the victory of our socialist construction and socialist transformation!

Long live the People's Republic of China marching on the road to socialism!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!

    在全国第一届工人体育运动大会上
    赖若愚同志的开幕词亲爱的工人运动员同志们、来宾同志们：
    全国第一届工人体育运动大会，现在正式在我国首都开幕了。
    这次全国工人体育运动大会的召开，是我国历史上的创举，它充分表现了我国人民民主制度的优越性，充分地表现了党和政府对于我国广大劳动人民物质、文化生活的关怀。在各地体育竞赛运动过程中已经获得的成就，表示着中国共产党和毛主席对开展体育运动的号召正是广大群众的要求和愿望。我代表大会主席团和中华全国总工会向大会的全体运动员同志们表示热烈的祝贺，向大会的全体裁判员和全体工作同志们表示感谢。
    召开全国第一届工人体育运动大会的目的，在于检阅新中国建立以来工人体育运动的成就，学习苏联开展工人体育运动的经验，提高工人体育运动的技术水平，进一步把厂矿企业和机关中的体育运动开展起来，从而增强全体职工的体质，保证胜利地完成我国第一个五年计划。
    中国工人阶级要胜利地担负起完成第一个五年计划的光荣任务，不仅需要有高度的政治觉悟和文化、技术水平，而且需要有健康的体质。事实证明，开展体育运动确是增强人民体质的一种最积极的有效的方法。不仅如此，体育运动并且是培养勇敢、坚毅、集体主义精神，培养共产主义道德的重要方法。所以，中国共产党和毛主席十分关怀人民体育运动的开展，认为这是党的一项重要政治任务。
    工会是共产主义学校，工会各级组织应该在党的领导和政府的支持下，认真地为广大工人群众进行体育锻炼准备应有的条件，引导他们从事经常的体育活动与锻炼。特别是经过这次运动大会，要把我国工人体育运动大大向前发展一步。
    全体运动员同志们，在这次体育运动大会上，希望你们表现出工人阶级应有的共产主义道德修养，表现出高度的共产主义体育道德，克服资产阶级的思想影响。希望你们不仅成为体育运动的爱好者，而且成为工人体育运动的组织者与宣传者，使工人体育运动获得广泛的发展。祝你们在生产方面，在学习方面，在体育运动方面，都获得优良的成就。
    同志们，我还要特别提到，苏联部长会议体育运动委员会主席尼·尼·罗曼诺夫同志应邀参加了这次大会，苏联工会应邀派来了它的体育代表团，来参加这次大会。他们的到来，对我国体育运动的开展，将会起久远的重大的影响。我们对他们的光临，表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的感谢。
    为中苏两国人民的健康和幸福，我们祝中苏两国运动员在体育运动方面都获得优良的成就！
    当我们在这里举行全国工人体育运动大会的时候，我们预祝我国第一个五年计划的胜利，祝我们社会主义建设事业和社会主义改造事业的胜利！
    向社会主义道路前进的中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
