Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch—According to the provisions of the First Five-Year Plan, the national total rice output is required to increase by 19.5% by 1957 compared to 1952. To ensure the completion of this task, the Ministry of Agriculture recently convened the National Rice Production Technology Conference to study ways to increase rice production in the next two years.

The conference analyzed the national rice production situation, pointing out that rice is a high-yield crop with huge potential for increased production among China's food crops. In recent years, the national rice planting area has accounted for more than 20% of the total food crop area, and the total rice output has accounted for more than 40% of the total grain output. However, the unit area yield of rice is generally still not high, with a national average of only over 300 jin per mu. At the same time, nearly half of the country's existing paddy fields cannot completely escape the threat of drought, and the yield is not stable enough, and some cannot even guarantee a harvest. The conference pointed out that the practice of the past few years has proved that changing the rice cultivation system is a good way to achieve increased production under today's conditions. Generally, changing from single-season to double-season can increase the yield by about 200 jin per mu, changing from intercropping to continuous cropping can increase the yield by about 150 jin per mu, and changing from indica rice to japonica rice can increase the yield by about 120 jin per mu. Therefore, the area of paddy fields changing the cultivation system across the country has rapidly increased, expanding by more than 800,000 mu in 1953 compared to 1952, another 3 million mu in 1954, and another 8.5 million mu in 1955. At present, the planting area of double-season rice in the country has reached more than 70 million mu. The conference pointed out that China has favorable conditions such as superior natural conditions, a long history of rice cultivation, and rich farmer production experience. No matter where in the country, as long as the water source is sufficient, rice can be planted. At present, rice production is mainly concentrated in the provinces south of the Qinling Mountains and the Huai River, with less cultivation in the northern provinces.

Starting from the above situation, the conference believes that in the future, it is necessary to universally increase the unit area yield of fields with guaranteed harvest, improve the production conditions of fields with insufficient guaranteed harvest to ensure a guaranteed harvest, and at the same time gradually expand the rice planting area and change the rice cultivation system according to local conditions to achieve increased rice production. After repeated discussions, the conference determined the following measures to increase production: In 1956 and 1957, the country should further build small-scale water conservancy projects and improve the original irrigation conditions to increase the area with guaranteed harvest by 30 million mu. At the same time, all localities should pay attention to increasing fertilizer application. In addition to increasing the supply of chemical fertilizers, the main task is to increase farm manure. Attention should be paid to the use of improved varieties and expand the planting area of improved rice varieties by more than 180 million mu; efforts should be made to prevent and control diseases and insect pests, focusing on the prevention and control of rice borers and rice blast. On the basis of improving cultivation management and doing a good job in prevention, cooperate with the use of pesticides for prevention and control; vigorously promote advanced technologies such as cultivating strong seedlings, close planting with small seedlings, careful land preparation, rational fertilization, shallow water and frequent irrigation, and careful harvesting and threshing, so as to universally increase the unit area yield. The conference pointed out that with the development of water conservancy resources and the reclamation of large areas of wasteland, the area of paddy fields should be gradually expanded, especially in the northern provinces. In 1956 and 1957, the country should expand the rice planting area by about 18 million mu, and develop upland rice and deep-water rice by more than 3.7 million mu. In the work of changing the rice cultivation system, all localities should continue to adopt the policy of active leadership, steady promotion, and ensuring increased production. In 1956, the area of paddy fields changing the cultivation system across the country should increase by 12 million mu compared to 1955.

In addition, the conference called on agricultural scientific workers in various places to strengthen the experimental research work on increasing rice production and strive to promote the completion of the task of increasing rice production.

    全国水稻生产技术会议根据五年计划规定
    确定今后两年水稻增产措施
    新华社七日讯　根据第一个五年计划的规定，到一九五七年全国稻谷总产量要求比一九五二年增加百分之十九点五。为保证完成这个任务，农业部最近召开全国水稻生产技术会议，研究了今后两年内水稻增产的途径。
    会议对全国水稻生产的情况作了分析，指出：水稻是我国粮食作物中具有巨大增产潜力的高产作物。几年来全国水稻种植面积占粮食作物总面积百分之二十以上，稻谷总产量占粮食总产量百分之四十以上。但是，水稻的单位面积产量一般还是不高的，全国平均每亩仅三百多斤。同时，全国现有稻田面积中有近半数还不能完全摆脱干旱的威胁，产量还不够稳定，有的甚至不能保证收成。会议指出：过去几年的实践证明：改变水稻栽培制度是在今天的条件下达到增产的良好办法。一般单季改双季每亩可增产二百斤左右，间作改连作每亩可增产一百五十斤左右，籼稻改粳稻每亩可增产一百二十斤左右。因此，全国改变栽培制度的稻田面积迅速增多，一九五三年比一九五二年扩大八十多万亩，一九五四年又扩大三百多万亩，一九五五年又扩大八百五十多万亩。目前全国双季稻的种植面积已达到七千多万亩。会议指出：我国具有自然条件优越，种植水稻历史悠久，农民生产经验丰富等有利条件。全国不论何地，只要水源充足，就可以种植水稻。目前水稻生产主要集中在秦岭、淮河以南各省，北方各省栽培较少。
    从上述情况出发，会议认为今后必须对收成有保证的田普遍提高单位面积产量，对收成缺少保证的田改善生产条件，以作到收成有保证，同时逐步扩大水稻种植面积，因地制宜改变水稻栽培制度，来达到水稻增产。会议经过反复讨论后，确定了以下的增产措施：一九五六年和一九五七年内，全国要进一步兴修小型水利，改善原有灌溉条件，使保收的面积增加三千万亩。同时，各地要注意增施肥料，除增加化学肥料的供应量外，主要是增加农家肥料，要注意采用良种，扩大良种水稻的种植面积一亿八千多万亩；努力防治病虫害，以防治螟虫和稻瘟病为主，在改进栽培管理作好预防工作的基础上，配合使用药剂防治；大力推广培育壮秧、小株密植、精细整地、合理施肥、浅水勤灌、细收细打等先进技术，从而普遍提高单位面积产量。会议指出：随着水利资源的开发和大片荒地的开垦，稻田面积要逐步扩大，特别是在北方各省。一九五六、一九五七两年内，全国要扩大水稻种植面积约一千八百万亩，并发展陆稻和深水稻三百七十多万亩。在改变水稻栽培制度的工作中，各地要继续采取积极领导、稳步推广、确保增产的方针。一九五六年全国改变栽培制度的稻田要比一九五五年增加一千二百万亩。
    此外，会议号召各地农业科学工作者加强水稻增产的试验研究工作，为促进水稻增产任务的完成而努力。
