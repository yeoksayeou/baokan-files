Xinhua News Agency, October 14th. Tass, Cairo, October 13th: The foreign ministers of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt recently held a meeting in Cairo to discuss the construction of water conservancy projects on the Jordan River and the allocation of the river's water.

　　The foreign ministers studied the "new" plan proposed by U.S. President's Special Envoy to the Middle East, Johnston, regarding the allocation of Jordan River water among Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel. The "new" plan stipulates certain increases in the amount of Jordan River water allocated to Arab countries, as well as some increase in the capacity of the Yarmuk River reservoir, which the Arabs have strongly demanded.

　　However, this plan stipulates that Israel will receive significantly more river water than each Arab country.

　　According to newspaper reports and Johnston's own statement in Egypt after the discussions, the foreign ministers rejected Johnston's plan. They believe this plan "does not conform to the interests of the Arabs."

　　As can be seen from the communique of the Arab League Political Committee, the foreign ministers of the four Arab countries decided to continue studying the Arab plan for utilizing the Jordan River, which was drafted by the Arab Technical Committee.

　　Egypt's "Al-Gomhouria" pointed out that the Arab Technical Committee demanded a complete rejection of the American plan and the construction of water conservancy projects on the Jordan River by the Arabs themselves, without the participation of the United States and Israel.

Xinhua News Agency, October 14th. Tass, Cairo, October 13th: Egyptian newspapers prominently published news about the Iranian government's decision to join the Near East military treaty and the Soviet government's statement to the Iranian government. The newspapers all carried the Soviet government's statement under large headlines on the front page.

　　"Al-Ahram" used a banner headline on its front page: "Russia Protests Iran Joining the Turkish-Iraqi Treaty." The newspaper said, "Iran's joining the Turkish-Iraqi treaty is a serious imperialist act."

　　"Al-Ahram's" London correspondent said that political observers acknowledge that Middle Eastern countries are "striving to pursue independent policies" and do not want to join military alliances with Western countries. The correspondent said that this attitude adopted by most Arab countries has hindered the implementation of Western military plans in the region.

　　The newspaper said that while Iran has joined this military bloc in the Near East, the core countries in the region, the Arab countries, have refused to join it.

　　"Al-Akhbar" said that the Iranian government should be responsible for the consequences of Iran's joining this military treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 14th. The "Indian Express" on the 13th considered Iran's participation in the Turkish-Iraqi-Pakistani military treaty to be a very serious matter. The newspaper published an editorial saying: "The Turkish-Iraqi-Pakistani treaty is a substitute for the Middle East defense organization plan initiated by the West, and a continuation of the British-Iraqi treaty signed in 1930. As a Western Asian appendage to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, its basic purpose is to ensure Western control over the region's oil wealth."

　　The newspaper also pointed out that Iran's participation in an aggressive alliance, "tying itself tightly to a group of countries," is playing a dangerous game.

### 阿拉伯国家外长会议拒绝约翰斯顿新方案  埃及印度等国报纸指出伊朗参加巴格达条约是危险的

    阿拉伯国家外长会议拒绝约翰斯顿新方案
    埃及印度等国报纸指出伊朗参加巴格达条约是危险的
    新华社十四日讯　塔斯社开罗十三日讯：叙利亚、黎巴嫩、约旦和埃及等几国外交部长最近在开罗举行的会议讨论了在约旦河上建筑水利工程和分配这条河的河水的问题。
    外长们研究了美国总统驻中东特使约翰斯顿所提出的关于叙利亚、约旦、黎巴嫩、以色列四国分配约旦河水的“新”方案。“新”方案规定分给阿拉伯国家的约旦河河水有某些增加，雅穆克河水库的容量也有些增加，这一点是阿拉伯人所坚决要求的。
    但是，这个方案规定以色列所分到的河水要比每个阿拉伯国家多得多。
    据报纸消息和约翰斯顿本人在这个问题讨论结束后在埃及发表的声明看来，外交部长们拒绝了约翰斯顿的方案。他们认为这个方案“不符合阿拉伯人的利益”。
    从阿拉伯联盟政治委员会的公报中可以看出，四个阿拉伯国家的外交部长决定继续研究阿拉伯技术委员会所拟订的关于利用约旦河河水的阿拉伯方案。
    埃及“共和国报”指出，阿拉伯技术委员会要求完全拒绝美国的方案，并且以阿拉伯人自己的力量在约旦河上建筑水利工程，而不要美国和以色列参加。
    新华社十四日讯　塔斯社开罗十三日讯：埃及的报纸以显著地位登载了关于伊朗政府决定参加近东军事条约和关于苏联政府对伊朗政府发表的声明的消息。报纸都在第一版大字标题下登载了苏联政府的声明。
    “金字塔报”第一版的通栏头号大字标题是：“俄国抗议伊朗加入土耳其—伊拉克条约”。报纸说，“伊朗加入土耳其—伊拉克条约是一个严重的帝国主义的行动。”
    “金字塔报”驻伦敦记者说，政治观察家们承认，中近东国家是“努力奉行独立的政策”而不想同西方国家一起参加军事联盟的。这个记者说，大多数阿拉伯国家所采取的这种态度阻碍了西方国家在这个地区的军事计划的执行。
    报纸说，就在伊朗已经参加了近东的这个军事集团的时候，这个地区的核心国家阿拉伯国家都拒绝参加这个集团。
    “消息报”说，伊朗政府应对伊朗加入这个军事条约的后果负责。
    新华社新德里十四日电　“印度快报”十三日认为伊朗参加土耳其—伊拉克—巴基斯坦军事条约这件事很严重。这家报纸发表社论说：“土耳其—伊拉克—巴基斯坦条约是西方发起的中东防御组织计划的代替物，也是一九三○年签订的英国—伊拉克条约的继续。作为北大西洋公约组织的西亚附属物，它的基本目的在于确保西方对这个地区的石油财富的控制。”
    这家报纸还指出，伊朗参加了侵略性的联盟，“把它自己紧紧地拴在一个国家集团里”，这是在玩着危险的把戏。
