    Dongting Lake Navigation Mark Reform Completed

    The navigation mark reform of Dongting Lake has been successfully completed.

    The reformed night navigation marks adopt the advanced Soviet chain-type night navigation mark system with obvious navigational effects, including danger indicator marks and signal marks. There are not only shore marks set on the shore, but also buoys set on the lake surface. All of them are illuminated at night. In dangerous areas, navigation mark lights are arranged on both sides to form a bright night lane, and ships navigate in the lane.

    Dongting Lake is the throat of Hunan's transportation. Local specialty materials from the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li river basins in Hunan, as well as industrial construction materials and daily necessities transported from the Yangtze River, all pass through Dongting Lake, with an estimated annual throughput of more than 100,000 tons. The lake maintains navigable water depths and has several good harbors for sheltering from the wind. In recent years, the state has made certain efforts to ensure navigation safety and improve vessel turnover efficiency. The daytime navigation marks and wind warning signals set up in the lake have played a certain guiding role for navigating vessels. However, this effort has not fully met the growing transportation requirements, and generally, ships still cannot navigate at night. Every year during the south wind season, the south wind usually rises in the morning and subsides in the afternoon; when the wind rises, ships cannot cross the lake, and after the wind subsides, it is already dark.

    After the navigation mark reform, the fleet on the Yueyang-Changsha line no longer needs to anchor by the lake overnight waiting to sail. (Tian Zhiheng)

    洞庭湖航标改革完成
    洞庭湖的航标改革已经胜利完成。
    改革后的夜航标志是采用苏联先进的有显明导航作用的锁链式的夜航标志，其中有指示危险的标志和信号标志。不仅有设在岸上的岸标，而且有设在湖面上的浮标。一到夜晚全放光明。在危险区域，航标灯在两旁排成一条明亮的夜巷，船舶在巷道中航行。
    洞庭湖是湖南运输上的咽喉。湖南的湘、资、沅、澧流域土特产物资和长江运来的工业建筑器材以及人民生活日用品，都是经过洞庭湖出入，每年通过量估计不下十多万吨。湖中经常保持通航水深，并有几处避风良港。几年以来，国家在保证航行安全、提高船舶周转效率方面，曾经作了一定的努力。湖中设置的白昼航标和风讯预告信号，对航行船舶起了一定导航作用。但这种努力没有能完全满足日益增长的运输要求，一般船只仍不能夜航。每年南风季节，一般是早晨起南风，午后收风；起风时船舶不能过湖，收风后天又黑了。
    航标改革以后，岳阳长沙线的船队不需要再停泊湖边过夜待航。（田志恒）
