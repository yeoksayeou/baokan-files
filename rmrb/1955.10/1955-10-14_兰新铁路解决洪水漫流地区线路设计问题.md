The design of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway through flood overflow areas is being revised by Chinese railway designers based on suggestions from Soviet experts. Preliminary calculations indicate that the revised design for this section of the line can reduce the number of large and small bridges by more than sixty compared to the original preliminary design, while the quality of the line will be better than the original design.

The flood overflow area is located more than forty kilometers west of Zhangye. In this area, spanning over thirty kilometers, the ground is covered with thousands of large and small gullies, resembling a spider web. These gullies are usually dry and waterless, but when it rains, floods rushing down from the Qilian Mountains overflow everywhere, washing away soil and sand. When designing this section of the line, Chinese surveying and design personnel originally decided to use a "bridge over every gully" approach, planning to build a hundred bridges over the larger gullies. However, Soviet bridge expert Katranov, after seeing this design, believed that floods from the smaller gullies would still destroy the railway in the future, and that the construction cost of "bridge over every gully" was too high. Therefore, he joined hydrologists and geologists on a site investigation, and suggested digging dozens of herringbone-shaped water collection ditches upstream of the railway line. This would first collect the floodwaters from all the large and small gullies into the water collection ditches, and then discharge the floodwaters to the downstream side of the railway line through more than thirty bridges. This would reduce the number of large and small bridges to be built by more than sixty compared to the original design, and ensure the safety of the line even better.

Solving the obstacle of the flood overflow area is a key technical problem in building the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway east of Yumen. The successful resolution of this problem has created favorable conditions for opening the line to Yumen next year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    兰新铁路解决洪水漫流地区线路设计问题
    我国铁路设计人员正根据苏联专家建议，修改兰新铁路经过洪水漫流地区的工程设计。据初步计算，经过修改以后的这一段线路设计，可比原来初步设计少修六十多座大小桥梁，线路的质量还比原设计的好。
    洪水漫流地区在张掖西面四十多公里的地方，这一带三十多公里内的地面上，像蛛网般密布着几千条大小的沟壑，平时干旱无水，等到下雨的时候，从祁连山上直泻下来的洪水，就遍地乱流，把泥土砂石冲走。我国勘测设计人员在设计这一段线路时，原决定用“逢沟架桥”的办法，共要在较大的沟壑上修筑一百座桥梁。苏联桥梁专家卡特兰诺夫看到这一设计后，认为将来小沟里流来的洪水仍会把铁路冲毁，“逢沟架桥”的建筑费用也太大。于是就会同水文地质等专家到现场调查，建议在铁路线上游接连开挖几十条人字形的积水沟，把所有大小沟壑中流来的洪水先汇集到积水沟中，然后通过三十多座桥梁把洪水宣泄到铁路线的下游，这样所需修筑的大小桥梁就比原设计减少了六十多座，线路安全更得到了保证。
    解决洪水漫流地区的障碍，是在玉门以东建筑兰新铁路的一个关键性技术问题，这个问题的顺利解决，就为明年通车玉门创造了有利条件。（新华社）
