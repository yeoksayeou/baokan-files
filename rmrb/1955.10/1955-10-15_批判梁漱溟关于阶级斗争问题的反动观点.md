    I.
    Liang Shuming said that from the Xinhai Revolution to the present, after forty years of continuous practice and continuous thinking, he built a "system" of understanding Chinese problems; his "ideological system" is different from the Communist Party's ideological system for solving Chinese problems, and this difference is "always centered around a central issue—the class issue of Chinese society."
    Indeed, for many years, Liang Shuming has been exhausting his efforts to oppose the Communist Party's use of the Marxist-Leninist class viewpoint to observe Chinese society and oppose the people's revolutionary movement led by the Communist Party. So, why has Liang Shuming been fighting the Communist Party by always centering around this "central issue"? Because he felt that if he could fabricate a set of "theories" to fundamentally deny the existence of classes in Chinese society, then he could "prove" that the Communist Party has no foundation or necessity for existence, Marxist-Leninist theory would be "refuted," class struggle could be "extinguished," and thus the reactionary rule of the reactionary classes could be "everlasting," and workers, peasants, etc., would never be able to stand up.
    Now, Liang Shuming's fallacies about the class issue have been shattered by the reality of the people's revolutionary victory, but Liang Shuming is not reconciled to the bankruptcy of his "theory." He not only does not genuinely and humbly examine where his mistakes lie, change his position, and repent, but instead persists in his errors, remains stubborn, and continues to spread his set of heresies whenever he has the opportunity. Therefore, it is very necessary for us to criticize Liang Shuming's reactionary views on the class issue, as this is the cornerstone of his reactionary "ideological system." At the same time, at this time when class struggle is becoming increasingly complex and acute, criticizing Liang Shuming's reactionary class theory and deepening our understanding of the issue of class struggle is also very meaningful for our people.
    II.
    Regarding the issue of class and class struggle, Liang Shuming has a most vicious slander against the Communist Party: Chinese society originally had no classes, but "the Communist Party learned a set of theories of division and struggle from abroad, and the techniques and style of division and struggle," and is "manufacturing" class struggle. For example, in his article "The Methods and Significance of Rural Agricultural Schools," he said: "Their peasant movement (referring to the peasant movement led by the Communist Party—author) first does a kind of divisive work in rural society, making rural society a situation of separation and confrontation. Struggle occurs within rural society." Again, for example, in his "Letter to Comrades and Students in Shandong Rural Work" in March 1938, he said: "What the Communist Party is doing is actually failing to recognize the essence of the Chinese revolution, overestimating the class issue in China, abusing its means of destruction and struggle, and is completely unsuitable to the requirements of the time and cannot be tolerated by the general trend." He attempted to use these slanderous words to show that the Chinese Communist Party is manufacturing class struggle.
    Are class and class struggle "manufactured" by the Communist Party? The Communist Party's abilities are indeed very great. For example, taking the Chinese Communist Party as an example, it has in the past led the Chinese people to overthrow the several big mountains pressing down on them, enabling the Chinese people to achieve liberation, and it is now leading the Chinese people to victoriously build a socialist society, which are all very convincing and admirable; even so, the Communist Party cannot manufacture class and class struggle at will. Because class and class struggle objectively existed and developed long before the Communist Party was established, the Communist Party can neither arbitrarily "manufacture" it nor arbitrarily "eliminate" it.
    Here, we cannot but simply explain what class is and how class is produced.
    Lenin gave a scientific definition of class in his article "A Great Beginning": "Classes are large groups of people differing from each other by the place they occupy in a historically determined system of social production, by their relation (in most cases fixed and formulated in law) to the means of production, by their role in the social organisation of labour, and, consequently, by the dimensions of the share of social wealth of which they dispose and the mode of acquiring it. Classes are groups of people one of which can appropriate the labour of another owing to the different places they occupy in a definite system of social economy."
    How are classes produced? Classes appeared in the stage of the disintegration of the primitive commune system and the emergence of the slave system. The emergence of classes requires two prerequisites: First, the development of labor tools and the increase of labor productivity. Because only when productivity increases to the point where surplus products can appear can the possibility of exploiting the labor of others arise. Second, the emergence of the social division of labor and the occurrence of private ownership of the means of production. Private ownership of the means of production is precisely the root cause of the division of society into classes. That is to say, the development of productive forces, the emergence of the social division of labor, the emergence of exchange and commodity production, the emergence of private ownership, and the possibility of occupying the labor of others caused by all of this are the objective basis for the emergence of classes.
    After the emergence of classes, due to the different positions and interests of each class, the antagonistic contradictions of the classes are irreconcilable, and class struggle inevitably occurs. Marx and Engels said long ago in the "Communist Manifesto": The history of all hitherto existing societies (except primitive communist society) is the history of class struggles. Whether it is slave society, feudal society, or capitalist society, all are filled with secret or open class struggles. Class struggle is the basis and driving force for the development of all antagonistic societies.
    From this, it seems that the emergence of class society has been for thousands of years, both abroad and in China, but the emergence of the Communist Party in the world has only been for more than a hundred years, and the emergence of the Chinese Communist Party has only been for more than thirty years. How can it be said that the Communist Party is "manufacturing" class struggle? Isn't this clearly Liang Shuming fabricating lies to slander the Communist Party and deceive the people?
    After liberation, has Liang Shuming's reactionary argument changed in any way? As everyone knows, he published an article entitled "What Transformations Have I Undergone in the Past Two Years?" in the "Guangming Daily" on October 5, 1951, in which he wrote: Because he traveled to the old liberated areas of Shandong, he clarified the fact that the northern countryside originally lacked two opposing classes, but in more than ten years, due to the fighting between the Japanese puppet troops, the Chiang bandit army, and the Eighth Route Army, class components "became greatly differentiated," and class opposition became increasingly acute. He said: "Under the 'anti-traitor' movement, peasants liquidated and struggled against many landlords and rich peasants, and class opposition became acute. Soon, Chiang's army came to attack the liberated areas and occupied them; the landlords and rich peasants then had a 'counter-liquidation' struggle and killed the peasants. Class hatred deepened again. But Chiang's army still could not stand firm; after the Liberation Army returned to the liberated areas, the peasants rose up again to kill the landlords and rich peasants; and finally eliminated the landlord and rich peasant classes through land reform." After this extremely distorted description of the facts, Liang Shuming went on to say: "This factual process shows that these northern rural areas lack two opposing classes like those in medieval Europe, but since there are differences in wealth and poverty, there is also the possibility of splitting into two sides and fighting each other when opportunities arise."
    From this, it seems that Liang Shuming's view on this issue has not "transformed" in any way. He is merely "singing the old tune," still slandering the Communist Party for manufacturing class struggle, and his words are filled with extreme hatred and rumors against the People's Liberation Army and the people of the liberated areas. For example, he said "After the Liberation Army returned to the liberated areas, the peasants rose up again to kill the landlords and rich peasants," etc., which are all shameless slanders that do not conform to the facts. Originally, anyone who understands Liang Shuming's reactionary political face would not be too surprised to read these words spoken by Liang Shuming after liberation. However, when these words are read by those who do not know much about Liang Shuming, they will inevitably have such doubts: "Is Liang Shuming too lacking in common sense of social science? Or is he 'harboring ulterior motives'?" Of course, these words of Liang Shuming did achieve "results," that is, they received echoes from the reactionary newspapers in Hong Kong. For example, so-called "theoreticians" of the Chiang bandit group, such as Hu Qiuyuan, wrote articles expressing "deep respect" and "support" for Liang Shuming, and praised him as a "great man," a "fighter of conscience," and a "model for intellectuals," etc.
    In addition, Liang Shuming has another argument for "manufacturing" class struggle: China's revolution was not caused by internal reasons, but by external reasons, that is, "triggered from the outside." As everyone knows, revolution is the most acute class struggle, and the basic issue of all revolutions is the revolutionary class seizing state power. That is to say, Liang Shuming believes that China's class struggles are all artificially created by foreign countries, and all revolutionary movements are imported from foreign countries. For example, he said: "According to the general practice in the West, revolutions are all outbreaks of internal social contradictions; now China's revolution is triggered from the outside, and the difference is very great." ("When Can China Have Peace?" published in the Chongqing Dagong Daily on January 18, 1949)
    Indeed, China's revolution in the past century has been greatly influenced by foreign countries, especially the occurrence of the Russian October Revolution and the establishment of socialist countries, which have had a greater impact on us. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The salvoes of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism." As a result, China's face has been completely renewed. However, the development of society is mainly due to internal causes rather than external causes, and external causes must play a role through internal causes. Foreign influence and assistance can only promote the development of the revolution if it meets the needs of China's internal social development and passes through the interior. If there were no classes and class struggles within China, no oppression and exploitation by imperialism and reactionary classes, and no awakening and resistance from the broad masses of the people, foreign influence would never lead to revolution. That is to say, revolution cannot be imported or exported, and foreign countries cannot manufacture class struggle in China. The lies fabricated by Liang Shuming are almost the same as what imperialism and the reactionaries often propagate.
    After liberation, Liang Shuming's reactionary argument has not changed in any way. For example, he said: "Therefore, in today's world, which is dividing into two major camps from a class standpoint and fighting a decisive battle, the trend is bound to tear Chinese society into two sides as well." "Since China is inevitably going to be involved in the world whirlpool in terms of the objective situation, and will eventually come out of the path of class struggle, then class struggle is the truth to solve the Chinese problem." ("What Transformations Have I Undergone in the Past Two Years?") This means: Although there are no classes in Chinese society, foreign countries have forcibly "manufactured" and "differentiated" classes and class struggle in China.
    True, there is now a socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and an imperialist camp headed by the United States in the world. The struggle between these two major camps is the center of modern world history. Moreover, the situation of this struggle is increasingly favorable to the socialist camp in the change of balance of power. Our People's Republic of China is a people's democratic country led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. We are now taking the path of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation to ensure the gradual elimination of the system of exploitation and establish a happy socialist society. Our constitution clearly stipulates: "In international affairs, our country's firm and unswerving policy is to strive for the lofty goals of world peace and human progress." Therefore, it is very natural for us to participate in the socialist camp and establish an unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that we "must lean to one side," "that is, lean to the socialist side."
    Comrade Mao Zedong also said long ago: The Chinese revolution is a part of the world revolution. In the past, China's old democratic revolution belonged to a part of the world bourgeois democratic revolution. However, because the First Imperialist World War and the Russian October Revolution changed the direction of the entire world history and divided the era of the entire world history. Since then, our China's new democratic revolution belongs to a part of the world proletarian socialist revolution. Because this new democratic revolution led by the proletariat thoroughly strikes against imperialism, it is not tolerated by imperialism but opposed by imperialism; however, it is tolerated by socialism and assisted by socialist countries and the socialist international proletariat. Therefore, this revolution cannot but become a part of the world revolution of proletarian socialism. Since our new democratic revolution is a part of the proletarian socialist world revolution, how can we, China, which is already carrying out the socialist revolution today, not actively and actively participate in the socialist camp to oppose the imperialist camp? Liang Shuming, where did you pull that from, how did you actually say that the two major camps "tore Chinese society into two sides"! The "subtext" of your words seems to be that you are very unhappy about our country's participation in the socialist camp!
    However, one thing is true. The demise of the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty, the establishment of our new China, and the victorious advance of the socialist cause, US imperialism is really unwilling to accept, and it will always try every means to find some remnants of counter-revolutionaries in China and constantly send special agents and spies to engage in subversive activities that are beneficial to US imperialism and its lackeys. It is precisely for this reason that Liang Shuming's reactionary remarks are very much liked by them and have won the cheers of reactionary elements!
    III.
    Liang Shuming's most important argument on the issue of class is that Western society has classes, but Chinese society does not, which is the uniqueness of China. For example, in his book "The Theory of Rural Construction," he said: "In medieval Europe, land belonged to aristocratic lords, and in modern times factories and machines belong to capitalists; and those who engage in labor, whether serfs or workers, are not allowed to own their own means of production; thus, two sides of exploitation and being exploited are created." However, we "Chinese society has not formed these two sides. The reason why it has not formed two sides is that its means of production are not monopolized by a part of the people." Again, for example, in his book "The Essentials of Chinese Culture," he said: "In general, countries are nothing but class rule; in fact, only classes can be said to rule. In China, one cannot see a ruling class, but only a ruler." "The two sides of political rule and being ruled have not been formed, which is exactly consistent with the two sides of economic exploitation and being exploited; the non-existence of its social classes is further clarified by mutual verification."
    After liberation, the issue of whether China has classes and class struggle is common sense that even ordinary elementary school students understand, but Liang Shuming sees ghosts in broad daylight, still saying that Chinese society "lacks the fact of classes," attempting to continue to deceive the people.
    In order to prove that China lacks classes, Liang Shuming even said, like Hu Shi, that China's feudal society had long disintegrated, "The two thousand years after the Qin and Han dynasties were not a feudal society," but what he concocted as a "society of ethical basis and occupational division." Comrade Mao Zedong has already said very clearly that in the three thousand years since the Zhou and Qin dynasties, China has been a feudal society. In China's feudal society, the self-sufficient natural economy occupies a major position, and the feudal land private ownership system is the basis for exploiting peasants. Landlords, nobles, and emperors are the feudal ruling class. They own the largest portion of land, while farmers own very little land or no land at all. Landlords, nobles, and emperors all live on the land rent extracted from peasants, and the state of the landlord class also forces peasants to pay tribute and engage in unpaid labor to support a large number of state officials and armies. The state organs that protect this feudal exploitation system are tools for the landlord class to oppress peasants. This mode of production began to appear in the states of some princes before the Qin Dynasty. After Emperor Qin Shihuang unified China, he established an autocratic, centralized feudal state based on this mode of production, while still retaining a state of division to some extent. Chinese peasants throughout the dynasties lived a slave-like life of extreme poverty and without any political rights under the exploitation and oppression of this feudal system. "The extreme poverty and backwardness of peasants caused by such cruel exploitation and oppression by the landlord class is the basic reason why Chinese society has stagnated in economic and social life for thousands of years." ("The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party")
    The main contradiction in feudal society is the contradiction between the peasant class and the landlord class. In the history of China, from the Qin Dynasty to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the Qing Dynasty, there have been hundreds of peasant uprisings, large and small. The number and scale of Chinese peasant riots and peasant revolutionary wars are rare in world history. This is by no means a "passive and peaceful situation for more than two thousand years," as Liang Shuming said, and what "history has passed through a cycle of order and chaos, without seeing a revolution," etc. In Chinese feudal society, the class struggle of peasants is the real driving force of historical development. The result of each major peasant uprising and peasant war has attacked the feudal rule at that time, thus promoting the development of social productive forces and social progress to some extent. This is by no means a state of non-advancement as Liang Shuming said, "China has been trapped in repeated circling for two thousand years," and what "reversal to the feudal age," etc.
    However, since the Opium War in 1840, the invasion of imperialist powers has caused Chinese feudal society to disintegrate and become a semi-feudal society, and independent China has become a semi-colonial China. Semi-feudal and semi-colonial became the characteristics of modern China. This is the nature of modern Chinese society, and this is the national condition of China in the past century. Understanding this social nature and national condition of old China in the past century is the starting point for us to understand various problems of the Chinese revolution. Because Liang Shuming does not understand this social nature and national condition of China in the past century, his understanding of various problems of the Chinese revolution (such as the object of the revolution, the task of the revolution, the driving force of the revolution, the nature of the revolution, and the future of the revolution, etc.) must be wrong.
    So, what classes are there in this semi-feudal and semi-colonial society? The intrusion of foreign capitalism has indeed destroyed the foundation of China's self-sufficient natural economy, but the feudal land relations and exploitative relations are basically preserved, feudalism in the countryside still occupies a dominant position, and the main classes in the countryside are still the landlord class and the peasant class (the internal of the peasants is in a process of fierce differentiation). At the same time, due to the stimulation of foreign capitalist invasion and some destruction of the feudal economic structure, Chinese national capitalism has had some development. Along with the direct operation of enterprises by imperialism in China, and along with the development of Chinese national capital, there appeared the Chinese proletariat and the bourgeoisie. These two new classes are interrelated and opposed to each other. However, the bourgeoisie has the distinction between the comprador bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie. The attitudes of the comprador bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie towards the revolution are different. In addition, China also has various types of petty bourgeoisie other than peasants (including broad intellectuals, small merchants, craftsmen, and freelancers) and vagrants, etc.
    Comrade Mao Zedong has detailed analyses and discussions on the social nature of China in the past century and the issue of which classes there are in "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society", "How to Analyze Rural Classes", "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party", and "On New Democracy" and other works. Presumably, Liang Shuming has read them all. However, obviously Liang Shuming does not agree with these views. Because he has his own "brilliant" views.
    But to be honest, Liang Shuming's views are really very naive and absurd. For example, Liang Shuming believes that to discuss whether there are classes in China, "the issue of land distribution should be the main key." ("The Essentials of Chinese Culture") Now let's talk about the issue of land distribution as this "main key"!
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi said very clearly in his "Report on the Issue of Land Reform" at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on June 14, 1950 that the general land situation in old China was roughly like this: that is, less than 10% of the landlords and rich peasants who accounted for the rural population occupied about 70% to 80% of the land, by which they cruelly exploited the peasants. And the poor peasants, hired peasants, middle peasants, and other people who accounted for 90% of the rural population only occupied about 20% to 30% of the land in total. They worked hard all year round but could not get enough to eat. After the recent ten years or so of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, this situation has changed somewhat. In some areas, the land is more concentrated in the hands of landlords. For example, in Sichuan and other areas, landlords occupied about 70% to 80% of the land. In some villages in East China and Central South, the general situation is roughly like this: landlords occupy about 30% to 50% of the land and public land, rich peasants occupy about 10% to 15% of the land, middle peasants, poor peasants, and hired peasants occupy about 30% to 40% of the land, and small land lessors occupy about 3% to 5% of the land. All rented land in the countryside accounts for about 60% to 70%. Rich peasants rent out about 3% to 5% of the land, and rich peasants cultivate their own land for about 10%. That is to say, 90% of the land in the countryside is cultivated by middle peasants, poor peasants, and some hired peasants, but they only have ownership of a part of the land, and do not have ownership of most of the land.
    This is the situation of land distribution in old China. This is the basis for dividing rural classes. This is the root cause of our nation's being invaded, oppressed, impoverished, and backward. This is the basic reason why we want to implement land reform.
    But how does Liang Shuming understand the issue of land distribution in China? He neither conducted any investigation and research on the situation of land distribution in China, nor did he think that some people's investigations and statistics were "fundamentally unreliable", so he had to generally say: "The situation of land concentration and monopoly is not obvious; general estimates are that people with land account for a large majority." ("The Essentials of Chinese Culture") According to Liang Shuming, the conclusion of a "Survey of Ding County's Social Conditions" by Li Jinghan was similar to Liang Shuming's estimate, so he said that this survey report was "absolutely reliable". In addition, Liang Shuming also used his own "observations" and what "proverbs" to prove that his estimates were correct, and thus concluded that there was no class opposition in the Chinese countryside. Even more ridiculous, Liang Shuming even believed that the "banner land" in the counties near Beijing in the past seemed to be the "equal distribution of the landlord's ownership" by tenant farmers. We don't need to use too much ink to refute these "self-deceiving" fallacies of Liang Shuming, because Liang Shuming himself has already admitted it. For example, Liang Shuming said: "Randomly taking what we saw in Zouping and Ding County as sufficient, we did not go to investigate places like Ju County, Zhucheng, Shan County, and Cao County in Shandong for several years, and we did not investigate the actual situation of landlord exploitation in Sichuan for several years. Only after visiting Lunan last year and participating in land reform in the southwest this year did we have something to see and hear. How can we avoid being ridiculed for deceiving ourselves and others when talking about social issues like this!" ("What Transformations Have I Undergone in the Past Two Years?")
    For another example, what is Liang Shuming's understanding of the development of Chinese industry and commerce? Liang Shuming said: "And in this kind of industry and commerce itself, on the one hand, it has not gone through an industrial revolution, and the trend of production concentration and capital concentration is not obvious; on the other hand, following the custom of dividing inheritance among all sons, capital, even if accumulated, is soon dispersed; so in general, they are just small workers and small merchants. Like the opposition between the two classes of labor and capital in modern industrial society, there is no talk of it here, so it goes without saying." So Liang Shuming summed up and said: "It can be said that in China since the Qin and Han dynasties, purely from an economic point of view, its agricultural and industrial production will not produce opposing classes." ("The Essentials of Chinese Culture")
    Liang Shuming's view is also inconsistent with the facts. As everyone knows, the development of commodity economy in Chinese feudal society had already been brewing the sprouts of capitalism. If there were no influence of foreign capitalism, China would also slowly develop into a capitalist society. However, due to the intrusion of foreign capital in the past century, it has promoted this development. Since the second half of the nineteenth century, some Chinese merchants, landlords, and officials have invested in new-style industries, and Chinese national capitalism has begun its initial development. Especially during the First World War, because European and American imperialist countries were busy with war and temporarily relaxed their oppression and aggression against China, Chinese national industry, mainly light industry, had further development. During this period, the textile industry increased from twenty-two factories in 1915 to forty-four factories in 1922, and the flour industry increased from sixty-seven factories in 1916 to one hundred and seven factories. In the same period, banks also increased to one hundred and eight. In the next few years, Chinese national industry still had some development under extremely difficult conditions. It is precisely because China has modern capitalist industry that new classes have appeared - the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. In old China, there were about 2.5 million to 3 million modern industrial workers. As for the hired laborers in urban small industry and handicraft industry and shop assistants, there were about 12 million, and there was also a large number of the rural proletariat (that is, hired peasants) and other urban and rural proletarians.
    Especially during the more than 20 years of Kuomintang rule in China, bureaucratic capital had a high degree of development. The four major families of Chiang, Song, Kong, and Chen owned 1 million to 2 million US dollars in property. They controlled the four major banks in finance, controlling China's economy and the "government's" finances. They almost monopolized all heavy industry sectors in industry, and the enterprises they operated accounted for more than 80% of China's total industrial capital. In addition, they also monopolized commerce, agriculture, real estate, and cultural enterprises. It can be said that they monopolized China's national economic lifeline. This bureaucratic capital was also combined with the reactionary state power and closely combined with imperialism. Those who owned this bureaucratic capital were called the bureaucratic bourgeoisie.
    In old China, what made the Chinese people fall into poverty, hunger, and suffering, and what kept Chinese society in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal state and prevented it from progressing were the three big mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism that were pressing down on the Chinese people, and the Kuomintang reactionaries were precisely the general representatives of all these reactionary forces.
    However, Liang Shuming, who claimed to have studied Chinese problems for forty years, could not see these facts, but closed his eyes all day long and repeated his "China lacks classes" like a monk chanting scriptures.
    IV.
    Liang Shuming has consistently opposed the Communist Party's viewing Chinese society from a class perspective and solving Chinese problems through class struggle. But who is right and who is wrong? We believe that practice is the standard of truth, and history is the best witness. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The reason why Marxism-Leninism is called truth is not only because Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and others scientifically constructed these theories, but also because it has been proved by the practice of revolutionary class struggle and national struggle since then." ("On Practice") The victory of the people's great revolution, the establishment and growing consolidation of the new China's regime, and the vigorous development of the socialist cause, do these not all prove the correctness of the Communist Party's theory, program, and policies? In the face of this iron fact, Liang Shuming cannot but admit: "That is, what I have firmly not believed for several years has actually appeared before my eyes." However, Liang Shuming did not change his position and accept ideological transformation because of this, but continued to cling to the bankrupt "theory".
    Regarding this issue, Liang Shuming changed his tone after liberation and said: "The reason why the Chinese Communist Party is successful today lies precisely in the point that I have always disagreed with him, as I said before; observing Chinese society from a class perspective and solving Chinese problems through class struggle. I now realize that even though Chinese society has the fact of lacking classes, it is still necessary to grasp it from a class perspective in order to have a solution." ("What Transformations Have I Undergone in the Past Two Years?") These words of Liang Shuming are really too incomprehensible. Since you believe that there are no classes in Chinese society, why grasp it from a class perspective? Since there are no classes in Chinese society, why do you say "I am clearly a petty bourgeoisie"? (As for whether you are a petty bourgeoisie, we won't talk about it here) Is this a confusion of your ideological logic, or are you deliberately playing a trick?
    As everyone knows, a basic view of Marxism-Leninism is that existence determines consciousness. When understanding social problems, we believe that social existence is the primary phenomenon, and social spirit is the secondary phenomenon. That is to say, the source of various social thoughts, theories, and viewpoints must be sought in the material living conditions of society, in social existence, because these thoughts, theories, and viewpoints, etc., are all reflections of social existence. Why do communists observe Chinese society from a class perspective? Why do they solve Chinese problems through class struggle? This is by no means the subjective prejudice of communists and their special fondness for this. It is precisely because Chinese society has the fact of the existence of classes and class struggles, and the existence of laws of class and class struggles.
    Since class and class struggle objectively exist, and class struggle has its laws that do not depend on people's will, then we must start from the actual things that objectively exist, understand these laws, and use these laws and apply these laws to seek welfare for society. The Chinese Communist Party must lead the Chinese working class and the Chinese people to carry out revolutionary struggle, and of course it must understand this law of class struggle, so as to determine its own policies, lines, and policies, and lead the masses of the people to carry out struggle. The significance of the Marxist-Leninist theory of class and class struggle lies in the fact that it provides a scientific basis for the policies and strategies of the proletariat, and points out to the proletariat the path and methods to realize socialism.
    Grasping the Marxist-Leninist theory of class struggle is not only important in understanding the laws of social development, the laws of class struggle, and determining the struggle strategies of the proletariat, but it is also important in observing a person and a kind of thought, theory, or viewpoint. Because in class society, all people exist as people of the class, and people have class nature. People's class nature is determined by their class status. In class society, people's thoughts, words, and actions are all permeated with class nature. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are branded with the mark of the class." ("On Practice") Therefore, we can see their different class natures from the various different thoughts, words, and actions of people. For example, if we conduct a class analysis with the correct class viewpoint, and study Liang Shuming's views on the class issue, it is not difficult to see Liang Shuming's special class nature, that is, which class's interests he represents and which class he serves.
    Why does Liang Shuming repeatedly talk about the class issue in many works? What are his absurd arguments on the class issue for? This is not for anything else, but precisely to oppose the Communist Party, oppose Marxism-Leninism, and oppose the people's revolutionary movement led by the Communist Party. As everyone knows, the Communist Party is the party of the working class. The first sentence in our party constitution is written like this: "The Communist Party of China is the advanced and organized force of the Chinese working class, and it is the highest form of its class organization." But according to Liang Shuming: Chinese society lacks classes, and there is no working class in China at all (Liang Shuming has another saying: "There are very few modern industrial workers in China, and it is impossible to rely on them for revolution.") In this case, the Chinese Communist Party lacks a class foundation, so there is no need for its existence. As everyone knows, the theory of class and class struggle is an important component of Marxism-Leninism. Marx and Engels proved that the existence of classes is linked to a certain historical stage of production development, and that class struggle must lead to the dictatorship of the proletariat, and that the dictatorship of the proletariat is a transition to eliminate all classes and move towards a classless society. But according to Liang Shuming: There is no class and class struggle in Chinese society, and Marxism-Leninism is not applicable to China. As everyone knows, the main enemies of the Chinese new democratic revolution are imperialism, the feudal landlord class, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. But according to Liang Shuming: Imperialism and feudal warlords, etc., are not objects of revolution, and the Chinese problem is not a revolution against anyone at all. In this case, the people's revolution led by the Communist Party is "aiming at nothing" and is fundamentally unnecessary. As everyone knows, the purpose of the Communist Party's past leadership of the peasant movement was to overthrow the feudal landlord class, so that peasants could obtain land, stand up and be masters, and live a happy life. But according to Liang Shuming: The peasant movement led by the Communist Party is "killing and arson", is "doing a kind of divisive work" in rural society, and is fundamentally unacceptable. Therefore, he wants to "eliminate the Communist Party's peasant movement" and replace the Communist Party's peasant movement with his "rural construction movement". There is no need to say more, just from these remarks, we can see most clearly the class nature of Liang Shuming, that is, he represents the interests of the reactionary landlord class and faithfully serves the landlord class. Moreover, the interests of the landlord class he represents are closely linked to the interests of imperialism and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie.

    V.
    Finally, we should point out that criticizing Liang Shuming's reactionary views on the issue of class and studying and publicizing the Marxist-Leninist theory of class and class struggle has direct and practical significance to our current revolutionary struggle. Although few people believe in Liang Shuming's reactionary views on the issue of class, and although the question of whether there are classes and class struggles in China is already common knowledge, this does not mean that all of our country's staff members, especially the youth, understand the truth of class struggle, that everyone has established the viewpoint of class struggle, and that they have learned the method of class analysis. Since the victory of the new democratic revolution and the establishment of the new China's regime, due to the brilliant achievements we have made in economic construction and various national work, especially our constitution stipulates that we "build a socialist society through peaceful means", so some naive and ignorant people, and those who are intoxicated with the achieved victory and are blindly optimistic, think that class struggle does not exist. When land reform was completed, some party members and rural cadres in rural areas believed that "there is no class struggle in rural areas anymore," and even felt that the landlord elements were "very honest" and the rich peasant class was "very obedient." From then on, "the revolution was successful, and everything was fine." Staff members in our industrial and mining enterprises also have a tendency to bury themselves in business, only care about production, and ignore politics. They thought that the people of the whole country were busy with production and construction, and that production and construction were advancing by leaps and bounds, "where is there any class struggle"? The most serious thing is that there are many people among us, including some Communist Party members and responsible comrades, who are developing an extremely dangerous sense of complacency and paralysis, losing political vigilance

    批判梁漱溟关于阶级斗争问题的反动观点
    沙英
    一
    梁漱溟说：他从辛亥革命到现在，经过四十年不断地实践和不断地思考，就筑起了对中国问题认识的一个“体系”；他的“思想体系”和共产党解决中国问题的思想体系是不同的，这种不同是“始终环绕着一个中心问题——中国社会的阶级问题”。
    的确，多少年来，梁漱溟一直用尽气力反对共产党以马克思列宁主义的阶级观点来观察中国社会，反对共产党所领导的人民革命运动。那末，梁漱溟为什么始终环绕着这个“中心问题”来和共产党作斗争呢？因为他觉得：如果能编造一套“理论”出来，从根本上否认中国社会有阶级的存在，那就可以“证明”共产党没有存在的基础和必要了，马克思列宁主义理论就被“驳倒”了，阶级斗争就可以“熄灭”了，从而反动阶级的反动统治就可以“万古长存”，工人和农民等也就永世不得翻身了。
    现在，梁漱溟关于阶级问题的谬论已被人民革命胜利的现实击得粉碎了，但是梁漱溟对于他的“理论”的破产并不甘心，他不但不真正虚心地检讨他的错误所在，转变立场，痛改前非，反而坚持其错误，顽固不化，并且一遇到机会，还不断散播他的那一套邪说。因此，我们批判梁漱溟关于阶级问题的反动观点是很必要的，这是他的反动的“思想体系”的基石。同时当此阶级斗争日益复杂和尖锐的情况下，批判梁漱溟反动的阶级论，加深对于阶级斗争问题的认识，对于我们的人来说，那也是很有意义的。
    二
    关于阶级和阶级斗争问题，梁漱溟有一个最恶毒的诬蔑共产党的说法：中国社会本来没有阶级，可是“共产党从外国学来一套分化斗争的理论，和分化斗争的技术与作风”，在“制造”阶级斗争。例如他在“乡农学校的办法及其意义”一文中说：“他们的农民运动（指共产党领导的农民运动——作者）是在乡村社会里首先作一种分化的工夫，使乡村社会成为分离对抗的形势。在乡村社会之内就发生斗争。”再如他一九三八年三月在“告山东乡村工作同人同学书”中说：“共产党之所为，实不认识中国革命的本质，过分估计中国的阶级问题，滥用其破坏斗争的手段，全不适合当时的要求，而为大势所不容。”他妄图用这种诬蔑的言词来说明中国共产党在制造阶级斗争。
    阶级和阶级斗争是共产党“制造”的吗？共产党的本领的确是很大的，例如以中国共产党来说，它过去曾领导中国人民推翻了压在他们身上的几座大山，使中国人民得到了解放，它现在正领导中国人民胜利地建设着社会主义社会，这都是非常使人信服和钦敬的；虽然这样，但是共产党却不能制造阶级和阶级斗争。因为阶级和阶级斗争早在共产党产生以前就客观地存在着和发展着，共产党既不能随意“制造”它，也不能随意“消灭”它。
    这里，我们就不能不简单地说明一下什么是阶级和阶级是怎样产生的？
    列宁在“伟大的创举”一文中曾对阶级下了一个科学的定义：“所谓各个阶级，就是在历史上一定社会生产体系中所处的地位不同，对生产资料的关系（这种关系大部分都是在法律上明文规定了的）不同，在社会劳动组织中所起的作用不同，因而领得自己所支配的那份社会财富的方式和多寡各不相同的几个巨大集团。所谓各阶级，就是由于彼此在一定社会经济结构中所处地位不同，而有某一集团能占得另一集团劳动的各个集团。”
    阶级是怎样产生的呢？阶级是在原始公社制度瓦解和奴隶制度产生这个阶段上出现的。阶级的出现要有这样两个前提条件：第一，劳动工具的发展和劳动生产率的提高。因为只有当生产率提高到可能出现剩余产品的时候，才能引起剥削他人的劳动的可能。第二，社会分工的出现和生产资料私有制的发生。生产资料的私有制正是社会之划分为阶级的根源。这就是说，生产力的发展、社会分工的出现、交换和商品生产的产生、私有制的出现，以及由这一切所引起的占有他人劳动的可能性，乃是阶级发生的客观的基础。
    阶级发生之后，由于各阶级的立场和利益不同，阶级对抗性的矛盾不可调和，便必不可免地发生阶级斗争。马克思和恩格斯在“共产党宣言”中早就说过：迄今存在过的一切社会的历史（原始共产社会除外）都是阶级斗争的历史。不论奴隶社会、封建社会和资本主义社会，都充满着秘密的或公开的阶级斗争。阶级斗争乃是一切对抗社会发展的基础和动力。
    由此看来，阶级社会的出现，不论在外国和中国都已经有数千年的历史了，可是世界上共产党的产生才不过一百多年，而中国共产党的产生才不过三十多年，这怎么能说共产党在“制造”阶级斗争呢？这不明明白白是梁漱溟在捏造谎言来诬蔑共产党和欺骗人民吗？
    在解放以后，梁漱溟这种反动论调是否有所改变呢？大家知道，他在一九五一年十月五日的“光明日报”上发表了一篇“两年来我有了那些转变？”的文章，其中他这样写道：由于他游历山东老解放区，弄清楚了这样的事实，即北方农村本来缺乏两面对立的阶级，但是在十几年中，由于日伪军、蒋匪军和八路军打来打去，于是阶级成份“乃大见区别”，阶级对立才日益尖锐。他说：“在‘反汉奸’运动下，农民清算斗争了许多地主富农，阶级对立于是尖锐。不久，蒋军又来进攻解放区而占领之；地富便有‘反清算’斗争，而杀了农民。阶级相仇，又自加深。但蒋军还是站不住；解放军回到解放区之后，农民又起来杀地富；且从土改而最后消灭了地富阶级。”梁漱溟在这一段极尽歪曲事实的叙述之后，紧接着说道：“这一事实经过，显示出来：这些北方农村中侭缺乏两面对立的阶级如欧洲中古者，但既有贫富不同，遇到机会亦可能裂开两边而相斗的。”
    由此看来，梁漱溟对这个问题的看法并没有什么“转变”，他只不过是“旧调重弹”，仍然污蔑共产党在制造阶级斗争，而且字里行间充满了对于人民解放军和解放区人民的极大仇恨和造谣。例如他说“解放军回到解放区之后，农民又起来杀地富”等等，这都是不符合事实的无耻诽谤。本来，凡是了解梁漱溟的反动政治面目的人，看了梁漱溟在解放后说的这些话，也并不感到多大惊奇。可是，这些话被那些不大了解梁漱溟的人看了，就难免发生这样的疑问：“梁漱溟是太缺乏社会科学的常识呢？还是‘别有用心’？”当然，梁漱溟这些话是收到“效果”的，即它得到了香港的反动报纸的回声，例如蒋匪集团的所谓“理论家”胡秋原之流，就大写文章对梁漱溟表示“深敬”和“声援”，并赞扬他为“大丈夫”、“良心的战士”和“知识分子的榜样”等等。
    此外，梁漱溟还有另一种“制造”阶级斗争的说法：中国的革命不是由于中国内部的原因，而是由于外部的原因产生的，即“从外引发”的。大家都知道，革命是最尖锐的阶级斗争，一切革命的基本问题都是革命阶级夺取国家政权的问题。这就是说，梁漱溟认为中国的阶级斗争都是外国硬造出来的，一切革命运动都是从外国输入的。例如他说：“照西洋通例，革命都是社会内部矛盾之爆发；现在中国的革命，则是由外引发，其不同很大。”（“中国那一天能太平？”载一九四九年一月十八日重庆大公报）
    诚然，中国近百年来的革命受外国的影响很大，特别是俄国十月革命的发生和社会主义国家的创立，对我们的影响更大。毛泽东同志说：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。”于是中国的面目就为之一新。但是，社会的发展主要地不是由于外因而是由于内因，而且外因必须通过内因才能起作用。外国的影响和帮助，只有它符合中国社会内部发展的需要并且通过内部才能促进革命的发展。如果中国内部没有阶级和阶级斗争，没有帝国主义和反动阶级的压迫和剥削，没有广大人民的觉醒和反抗，外国的影响总是不会发生革命的。这就是说，革命是不能输入和输出的，外国是不能在中国制造阶级斗争的。梁漱溟捏造的这种谎言，正和帝国主义和反动派所常宣传的东西差不多。
    在解放以后，梁漱溟的这种反动论调也并没有什么改变。例如他说道：“因而整个世界正从阶级立场分成两大阵营而决斗的今天，其势必然要把中国社会亦扯裂到两边去。”“既然客观形势上中国不可免地要卷入世界漩涡，而终必出于阶级斗争之一途，那么，阶级斗争便是解决中国问题的真理。”（“两年来我有了那些转变？”）这意思是说：中国社会虽无阶级，但是外国硬将中国“制造”和“分化”出阶级和阶级斗争来了。
    不错，现在世界上有以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和以美国为首的帝国主义阵营。这两大阵营的斗争乃是现代世界历史的中心。而且这种斗争的形势，在力量对比的变化中是日益有利于社会主义阵营。我们中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。我们现在正通过社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的道路，保证逐步消灭剥削制度，来建立一个美满的社会主义社会。我们的宪法上明文规定：“在国际事务中，我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。”因此，我们参加社会主义阵营这一方面，同苏联和各人民民主国家建立了牢不可破的友谊，那是很自然的事情。毛泽东同志曾教导我们说：我们“必须一边倒”，“就是倒向社会主义一边”。
    毛泽东同志也早就说过：中国革命是世界革命的一部分。从前中国的旧民主主义革命，是属于世界资产阶级民主主义革命的一部分。可是，因为第一次帝国主义世界大战和俄国的十月革命，改变了整个世界历史的方向，划分了整个世界历史的时代。从这以后，我们中国的新民主主义革命，那就属于世界无产阶级社会主义革命的一部分了。因为这种为无产阶级所领导的新民主主义革命，是彻底打击帝国主义的，因此它不为帝国主义所容许，而为帝国主义所反对；但是它却为社会主义所容许，而为社会主义的国家和社会主义的国际无产阶级所援助。因此，这种革命，就不能不变成无产阶级社会主义世界革命的一部分。既然我们的新民主主义革命就是无产阶级的社会主义的世界革命的一部分了，那末我们今天已在进行着社会主义革命的中国，难道还能不主动地积极地参加社会主义阵营来反对帝国主义阵营吗？梁漱溟你扯到哪里去了，怎么竟然说两大阵营“把中国社会亦扯裂到两边去”了！你这种话的“弦外之音”，好像是对我们国家参加到社会主义阵营这一方面是很不高兴的！
    不过，有一点却是事实。蒋介石王朝的灭亡，我们新中国的成立，和社会主义事业胜利地前进，美帝国主义实在是不甘心的，它总要千方百计地设法在中国网罗一些残余的反革命分子，并不断地派遣特务间谍，来从事有利于美帝国主义及其走狗的颠覆活动。正因为这个缘故，梁漱溟的反动言论，是他们很喜欢的，所以博得了反动分子的喝彩！
    三
    关于阶级问题梁漱溟最主要的论点，就是说西洋社会是有阶级的，可是中国社会却没有阶级，这是中国的特殊性。例如他在“乡村建设理论”一书中说：“西洋中世纪时，土地都属于贵族领主，至近代的工厂机器又属于资本家；而任生产工作之劳者，若农奴、若工人，均不得自有其生产工具；遂造成剥削与被剥削的两面。”可是我们“中国社会则没有构成这两面。其所以没构成两面，即在其生产工具没有被一部分人所垄断的形势。”再例如他在“中国文化要义”一书中说：“一般国家莫非阶级统治；其实，亦只有阶级才能说到统治。在中国看不到统治阶级，而只见有一个统治者。”“政治上统治被统治之两面没有形成，与其经济上剥削被剥削之两面没有形成，恰相一致；其社会阶级之不存在，因互证而益明。”
    在解放以后，关于中国有没有阶级和阶级斗争的问题，这是连普通小学生都懂得的常识了，可是梁漱溟却白昼见鬼，依然口口声声说中国社会“缺乏阶级的事实”，妄图继续欺骗人民。
    梁漱溟为了证明中国缺乏阶级，甚至像胡适一样说中国的封建社会早就解体了，“秦汉以后之两千年，原不是什么封建社会”，而是他所胡诌的什么“伦理本位，职业分途”的社会。毛泽东同志早就说的很清楚，自周秦以来的三千年间，中国是一个封建社会。在中国的封建社会里，自给自足的自然经济占主要地位，封建的土地私有制是剥削农民的基础。地主、贵族和皇帝是封建的统治阶级，他们拥有最大部分的土地，而农民则很少土地或者完全没有土地。地主、贵族和皇帝都依靠剥削农民的地租过活，而且地主阶级的国家还强迫农民缴纳贡税和从事无偿的劳役，去养活一大群国家官吏和军队。保护这种封建剥削制度的国家机关，是地主阶级压迫农民的工具。这种生产方式在秦以前已经在一部分诸侯的国家里面开始出现，自秦始皇统一中国以后，就建立了以这种生产方式为基础的专制主义的中央集权的封建国家，同时在某种程度上仍然保留着割据状态。中国历代的农民，就是在这种封建制度的剥削和压迫之下，过着极端贫困的、没有任何政治权利的奴隶式的生活。“地主阶级这样残酷的剥削和压迫所造成的农民的极端的穷苦和落后，就是中国社会几千年在经济上和社会生活上停滞不前的基本原因”。（“中国革命和中国共产党”）
    封建社会的主要矛盾，就是农民阶级和地主阶级的矛盾。地主和农民的阶级斗争，在中国历史上，从秦朝到清朝的太平天国，农民的起义总计大小就有数百次之多。中国农民暴动和农民革命战争的次数之多和规模之大，是世界历史上所仅见的。这绝不是像梁漱溟所说的“两千多年来它常常是一种消极相安之局”，以及什么“历史亦就在一治一乱之循环中度过，不见有革命”等等。在中国封建社会里，农民的阶级斗争才是历史发展的真正动力。每一次较大的农民起义和农民战争的结果，都打击了当时的封建统治，因而也就多少推动了社会生产力的发展和社会的进步。这也绝不是像梁漱溟所说的“中国两千年来已陷于往复盘旋”的不进状态，以及什么“逆转到封建之世”等等。
    可是自从一八四○年鸦片战争之后，帝国主义列强的侵略，使中国封建社会趋于解体，变成了半封建社会，独立的中国变成了半殖民地的中国。半封建半殖民地成为近代中国的特点。这就是近代中国社会的性质，这就是近百年来中国的国情。了解近百年来旧中国的这种社会性质和国情，是我们了解中国革命各种问题的出发点。梁漱溟正因为不了解近百年来中国的这种社会性质和国情，所以他对中国革命的各种问题（例如革命的对象、革命的任务、革命的动力、革命的性质和革命的前途等）的了解必然是错误的。
    那么，在这种半封建半殖民地的社会里有哪些阶级呢？外国资本主义的侵入固然破坏了中国自给自足的自然经济的基础，但是封建的土地关系和剥削关系在基本上还是保存着，农村中的封建主义仍占统治地位，农村中主要的阶级还是地主阶级和农民阶级（农民的内部在激烈地分化的过程中）。同时，由于外国资本主义侵入的刺激和封建经济结构的某些破坏，中国民族资本主义便有了一些发展。伴随着帝国主义在中国直接经营企业，伴随着中国民族资本的发展，这就出现了中国的无产阶级和资产阶级。这两个新生的阶级，是互相关联而又互相对立的。不过，资产阶级有带买办性的大资产阶级和民族资产阶级的区别。买办资产阶级和民族资产阶级对革命的态度是不同的。此外，中国还有除农民以外的各种类型的小资产阶级（包括广大的知识分子、小商人、手工业者和自由职业者）和游民等。
    关于近百年来中国的社会性质和有哪些阶级的问题，毛泽东同志在“中国社会各阶级的分析”“怎样分析农村阶级”“中国革命和中国共产党”“新民主主义论”等等著作中都有详细的分析和论述。想来，梁漱溟都是看过的。但是，显然梁漱溟是不同意这些见解的。因为他自己有一套“高明”的见解。
    不过说句老实话，梁漱溟的见解实在是非常幼稚和荒谬的。譬如说，梁漱溟认为要讨论中国有没有阶级的问题，“则土地分配问题自应为主要关键所在”。（“中国文化要义”）现在我们就以土地分配这个“主要关键”问题来谈谈吧！
    刘少奇同志一九五○年六月十四日在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上“关于土地改革问题的报告”中说的很明白，旧中国一般的土地情况大体是这样：即占乡村人口不到百分之十的地主和富农，占有约百分之七十至八十的土地，他们借此残酷地剥削农民。而占乡村人口百分之九十的贫农、雇农、中农及其他人民，却总共只占有约百分之二十至三十的土地，他们终年劳动，不得温饱。这种情形，经过最近十余年的抗战和人民解放战争之后，是有了一些变动，有一些地区的土地是更加集中在地主手中，例如四川及其他地区，地主占有土地约占百分之七十至八十。在华东及中南一些乡村中，一般的情况大体是这样：地主占有土地及公地约占百分之三十至五十，富农占有土地约百分之十至十五，中农、贫农、雇农占有土地约百分之三十至四十，小土地出租者占有土地约百分之三至五。乡村中全部出租土地约占百分之六十至七十。富农出租土地约占百分之三至五，富农自耕土地约占百分之十。这就是说，乡村中百分之九十的土地是中农、贫农及一部分雇农耕种的，但他们只对一部分土地有所有权，对大部分土地则没有所有权。
    这就是旧中国土地分配的情况。这就是划分农村阶级的根据。这就是我们民族被侵略、被压迫、贫困和落后的根源。这就是我们所以要实行土地改革的基本理由。
    但是梁漱溟怎样了解中国的土地分配问题呢？他既没有对中国的土地分配情况进行过调查研究，他又认为别人的一些调查统计“皆根本不可靠”，所以只好笼统地说：“土地集中垄断之情形不著；一般估计，有土地底人颇占多数。”（“中国文化要义”）据梁漱溟说，有一位李景汉的“定县社会概况调查”的结论同梁漱溟的估计差不多，所以他便说这个调查报告“绝对可靠”。此外梁漱溟还根据自己的“所见”和什么“谚语”等等，来证明自己的估计是正确的，并从而得出中国农村没有阶级对立的结论。更滑稽可笑的，甚至梁漱溟竟认为过去北京附近各县的“旗地”，好像是佃农“平分了地主的所有权”。像梁漱溟这些“自欺欺人”的谬论，我们不必多用笔墨加以反驳，因为梁漱溟自己已经承认了。例如梁漱溟说：“漫然以我们在邹平、定县各处之所见为足，在山东数年而不去调查莒县、诸城、单县、曹县那些地方，在四川数年而于其地主剥削实况不加考察。直待去年到鲁南参观，今年参加西南土地改革，乃始有见有闻。像这样谈社会问题，何能免于自欺欺人之讥！”（“两年来我有了哪些转变？”）
    再譬如说，梁漱溟对于中国工商业发展情况的认识是怎样的呢？梁漱溟说：“而在这种工商业本身，一面没有经过产业革命，生产集中资本集中之趋势不著；一面循着遗产诸子均分之习俗，资本纵有积蓄，旋即分散；所以总不外是些小工小商。像近代工业社会劳资两阶级之对立者，在此谈不到，所以不待言。”于是梁漱溟总结起来说：“可以说，秦汉以来之中国，单纯从经济上看去，其农工生产都不会演出对立之阶级来。”（“中国文化要义”）
    梁漱溟这种见解同样是不符事实的。大家都知道，中国封建社会内的商品经济的发展，就已经孕育着资本主义的萌芽，如果没有外国资本主义的影响，中国也将缓慢地发展到资本主义社会。可是近百年来由于外国资本的侵入，是促进了这种发展。从十九世纪下半期起，中国就有一部分商人、地主和官僚投资于新式工业，中国民族资本主义就开始了初步的发展。特别是到第一次世界大战时，由于欧美帝国主义国家忙于战争，暂时放松了对中国的压迫和侵略，于是中国的民族工业，主要是轻工业，曾得到进一步的发展。在这一时期中，纺织业由一九一五年的二十二个厂增加到一九二二年的四十四个厂，面粉业由一九一六年的六十七个厂增加到一百零七个厂。在同一时期内，银行也增加到一百零八家。在以后若干年中，中国民族工业在极困难的条件下也还是有若干发展。正由于中国有了现代性的资本主义工业，所以也就有了新的阶级——资产阶级和无产阶级出现。在旧中国，现代产业工人约有二百五十万至三百万。至于城市小工业和手工业的雇佣劳动者和商店店员约有一千二百万，农村的无产阶级（即雇农）及其他城乡无产者尚有广大的数目。
    特别是在国民党统治中国的二十多年间，官僚资本有了高度的发展。蒋、宋、孔、陈这四大家族，拥有一百万万到两百万万美元的财产。他们在金融上掌握了四大银行，控制着中国的经济和“政府”的财政。他们在工业上几乎垄断了全部的重工业部门，他们所经营的企业占中国全部产业资本百分之八十以上。此外，他们还垄断了商业、农业、地产和文化企业部门等。可以说他们是垄断了中国全国的经济命脉。这种官僚资本还和反动的国家政权结合在一起，并同帝国主义密切结合着。拥有这种官僚资本的叫官僚资产阶级。
    在旧中国，使中国人民陷于贫困、饥饿和痛苦的，使中国社会停留于半殖民地半封建状态而阻止它进步的，就是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义这三座压在中国人民身上的大山，而国民党反动派正是这一切反动势力的总代表人。
    但是，自称研究中国问题达四十年的梁漱溟，却看不见这些事实，而成天闭着眼睛像和尚念经似地一再重复其“中国缺乏阶级”的梦呓。
    四
    梁漱溟过去一贯反对共产党以阶级眼光观察中国社会，以阶级斗争解决中国问题。但究竟谁对谁错呢？我们认为实践是真理的标准，历史是最好的证人。毛泽东同志说：“马克思列宁主义之所以被称为真理，也不但在于马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林等人科学地构成这些学说的时候，而且在于为尔后革命的阶级斗争和民族斗争的实践所证实的时候。”（“实践论”）人民大革命的胜利，新中国政权的建立和日益巩固，社会主义事业的蓬勃进展，这难道不都证明了共产党的理论、纲领和政策的正确吗？在这种铁的事实面前，梁漱溟也不能不承认：“即是若干年来我坚决不相信的事情，竟出现在我眼前。”可是，梁漱溟并没有因此而转变其立场，接受思想改造，反而继续抱着那已经破产了的“理论”死死不放。
    关于这个问题，梁漱溟在解放后换了一种腔调说道：“中国共产党今天所以成功，恰在前面说过我所一直不同意于他的那一点；以阶级眼光观察中国社会，以阶级斗争解决中国问题。我现在觉悟到侭管中国社会有其缺乏阶级的事实，仍然要本着阶级观点来把握它，才有办法。”（“两年来我有了哪些转变？”）梁漱溟这些话实在是太不通了。既然你认为中国社会没有阶级，为什么要以阶级观点去把握它呢？既然中国社会没有阶级，为什么你却说“我明明是一个小资产阶级”呢？（至于你是不是小资产阶级这里不谈）这到底是你思想逻辑的混乱，还是你在故意耍弄一种手法？
    大家都知道，马克思列宁主义的一个基本观点，就是存在决定意识。在认识社会问题的时候，我们认为社会的存在是第一性的现象，而社会精神则是第二性的现象。这就是说，各种社会思想、理论和观点的来源，都要到社会的物质生活条件中、到社会存在中去探求，因为这些思想、理论和观点等等，都是社会存在的反映。共产党人为什么要以阶级眼光观察中国社会，为什么要以阶级斗争解决中国问题呢？这绝不是共产党人的主观偏见和自己特别喜爱这样，这正是因为中国社会存在着阶级和阶级斗争的事实，存在着阶级和阶级斗争的规律。
    既然阶级和阶级斗争是客观地存在着的，而且阶级斗争有其不以人们意志为转移的规律，那末，我们就要从客观存在着的实际事物出发，去认识这种规律，并依据这种规律和运用这种规律来为社会谋福利。中国共产党要领导中国工人阶级和中国人民进行革命斗争，当然要认识这种阶级斗争的规律，从而决定自己的方针、路线和政策，来领导人民群众进行斗争。马克思列宁主义的阶级和阶级斗争理论的意义，就在于它为无产阶级的政策和策略提供了科学的基础，并向无产阶级指出了实现社会主义的道路和方法。
    掌握马克思列宁主义关于阶级斗争的学说，不仅在了解社会发展的规律、阶级斗争的规律和确定无产阶级的斗争策略时是重要的，就是在观察一个人物和一种思想、理论、观点时也是重要的。因为在阶级社会中，一切的人们都是作为阶级的人而存在的，人是有阶级性的。人的阶级性是由人的阶级地位决定的。在阶级社会中，人们的一切思想、言论和行动等，都贯穿着阶级性。毛泽东同志说：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”（“实践论”）因此，我们从人们各种不同的思想、言论和行动中，即可看出他们不同的阶级性。譬如说，如果以正确的阶级观点进行阶级分析，把梁漱溟关于阶级问题的观点加以研究，就不难看出梁漱溟的特殊的阶级性，即他代表什么阶级的利益和为什么阶级服务的。
    梁漱溟为什么在许多著作中反复地谈论阶级问题呢？他那些关于阶级问题的荒谬的论点到底是为了什么呢？这不是为了别的，正是为了反对共产党、反对马克思列宁主义、反对共产党领导的人民革命运动。大家都知道，共产党是工人阶级的政党，在我们的党章中第一句就这样写着：“中国共产党，是中国工人阶级的先进的有组织的部队，是它的阶级组织的最高形式。”可是照梁漱溟说来：中国社会缺乏阶级，中国根本没有什么工人阶级（梁漱溟另有一种说法：“中国所有近代产业工人甚少，靠他革命是靠不来的。”）既然这样，中国共产党缺乏阶级基础，那就没有存在的必要了。大家都知道，关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论是马克思列宁主义重要的组成部分，马克思和恩格斯证明了：阶级的存在是同生产发展的一定的历史阶段联系着，阶级斗争必然走向无产阶级专政，无产阶级专政是走向消灭一切阶级和走向无阶级社会的过渡。可是照梁漱溟说来：中国社会是没有阶级和阶级斗争的，马克思列宁主义是不适用于中国的。大家都知道，中国新民主主义革命主要的敌人是帝国主义、封建地主阶级和官僚资产阶级。可是照梁漱溟说来：帝国主义和封建军阀等都不是革命的对象，中国问题根本不是对谁革命。既然这样，共产党领导的人民革命就是“无的放矢”和根本不需要的了。大家都知道，共产党过去领导农民运动的目的，是为了打倒封建地主阶级，使农民得到土地、翻身作主、过着幸福的生活。可是照梁漱溟说来：共产党领导的农民运动是“杀人放火”，是在乡村社会里“作一种分化的工夫”，是根本要不得的，所以他要“消除共产党的农民运动”，以他的“乡村建设运动”来代替共产党的农民运动。不必再说了，仅就这些言论，我们就可以最鲜明地看出梁漱溟的阶级性，即他是代表反动的地主阶级的利益并忠实地为地主阶级服务的。而且他代表的地主阶级的利益又是和帝国主义、官僚资产阶级的利益密切联系着的。

    最后，我们应当指出，批判梁漱溟关于阶级问题的反动观点，学习和宣传马克思列宁主义关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论，对我们当前的革命斗争是具有直接的现实意义的。虽然梁漱溟关于阶级问题的反动观点很少有人信服，虽然中国有没有阶级和阶级斗争的问题已是普通的常识，但这并不是说我们国家的工作人员特别是青年们都懂得阶级斗争的道理了，大家都树立阶级斗争的观点和学会阶级分析的方法了。自从新民主主义革命取得胜利和新中国的政权建立之后，由于我们在经济建设和国家的各种工作中取得了光辉的成绩，特别是我们的宪法上又规定我们“通过和平的道路”来建设社会主义社会，于是有些幼稚无知的人，和那些陶醉于已得的胜利而盲目乐观的人，便以为阶级斗争不存在了。当土地改革完成的时候，在农村中有一些党员和农村干部就认为“农村没有阶级斗争啦”，甚至觉得地主分子“很老实”、富农阶级也“很听话”，从此“革命成功，万事大吉”了。在我们的工矿企业中的工作人员，也产生一种埋头业务、只顾生产而不问政治的倾向。他们以为全国人民都在忙于生产建设，而且生产建设正在突飞猛进，“那里还有什么阶级斗争”？最严重的是，在我们中间有不少的人，其中包括一部分共产党员和负责同志，正在滋长一种极端危险的太平麻痹情绪，丧失了政治警惕性，对于暗藏的反革命分子的各种破坏活动熟视无睹，把复杂尖锐的阶级斗争看得简单化，甚至说：“几条小鱼翻不起大浪”；主张“马放南山，刀枪入库”等等。当然，我们这些同志不一定读过梁漱溟关于阶级问题的言论，就是读过也不一定相信他的胡说，但是在实际上这些人们的观点难道不是和梁漱溟的观点有些类似吗？这难道不值得严重警惕吗？
    马克思列宁主义关于阶级和阶级斗争的学说指明：只要社会中有阶级存在，阶级斗争是不可避免的，就是无产阶级取得政权之后在进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的时候，阶级斗争也不是日趋缓和而是更趋复杂和尖锐化了。因此，共产党不要去熄灭阶级斗争，而要把阶级斗争进行到胜利的终结，进行到把一切阶级都消灭即共产主义胜利的时候。我们的国家现在正处于一个过渡时期，在过渡时期内，由于各种经济成分的存在，由于还有剥削阶级存在，由于我们为了建设社会主义而要彻底消灭一切剥削制度，所以进行不调和的阶级斗争是不可避免的。而且随着社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的进展，阶级斗争不是日趋缓和而是日益复杂和尖锐化了。在这种阶级斗争日益复杂和尖锐的情况下，为了加强和保卫社会主义建设，为了使我们的工作不犯错误或少犯错误，我们必须认真学习马克思列宁主义关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论，树立阶级斗争的观点，学会阶级分析的方法。只有这样，才能认清我国过渡时期阶级斗争的规律和特点，并依据这种规律和特点来正确地制定和掌握政策，提高政治警惕性，以便正确地指导阶级斗争，战胜敌人，加速社会主义的建设事业。
