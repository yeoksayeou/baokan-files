    Writers in Beijing Actively Create Works for Children
    As of the 21st, the Chinese Writers Association had received plans from forty-seven writers, including Sha Ting, Zhou Libo, Zhao Shuli, Zhang Tianyi, Yan Wenjing, Kang Zhuo, Qin Zhaoyang, Ma Feng, and Xie Bingxin, to create children's literature works. They plan to create poetry, novels, plays, fairy tales, science fiction fairy tales, and fantasy stories. Some of these can be completed this year, and others will be completed before the end of June next year.
    Since the "People's Daily" published an editorial entitled "Create, Publish, and Distribute a Large Number of Children's Publications," writers have responded to this call and made plans to create children's literature works. The writer Ye Shengtao plans to write one or two works for young readers within a year, and also plans to revise and compile two previously published fairy tales into a single volume for publication. The writer Feng Xuefeng plans to complete an adventure story before March next year. Children's literature writer Jin Jin plans to write a collection of poems reflecting the lives of children in rural areas. The female writer Li Bozhao plans to write a novel entitled "Joining the League" and several short stories about the Five-Year Plan for young readers. The scientist Gao Shiqi will also write a book of science fiction poems or science stories within a year.
    The poets Li Ji and Ruan Zhangjing have each completed a fairy tale poem. Children's literature writer Chen Bochui has completed the first drafts of the fairy tale "A Cat That Wanted to Fly" and the novel "People Sent by Chairman Mao". Children's literature writer Guan Hua has written twenty-two fairy tales this year, including "The Legend of Mount Mushtak", and is currently creating a medium-length fairy tale. The poet Yuan Ying has recently compiled sixteen poems about children written over the past two years into a collection entitled "When the Bonfire Burns," and handed it over to the Children's Publishing House for publication. He is also writing a novel depicting the underground revolutionary activities of the Young Pioneers before liberation.

    在北京的作家们积极为少年儿童创作
    到二十一日为止，中国作家协会收到了沙汀、周立波、赵树理、张天翼、严文井、康濯、秦兆阳、马烽、谢冰心等四十七位作家创作儿童文学作品的计划。他们准备创作诗歌、小说、戏剧、童话、科学童话和幻想故事。其中有一部分可在今年完成，另一部分将在明年六月底以前完成。
    自从“人民日报”发表了题为“大量创作、出版、发行少年儿童读物”的社论以后，作家们就纷纷响应这一号召，订出了创作少年儿童文学作品的计划。作家叶圣陶计划在一年内为少年儿童读者写一两篇作品，还计划把过去出版过的两本童话重新修改，选编成一册出版。作家冯雪峰准备在明年三月前完成一篇冒险故事。儿童文学作家金近计划写一本反映农村儿童生活的诗集。女作家李伯钊准备为青年和少年读者写一篇题为“入团”的小说和几则关于五年计划的小故事。科学家高士其也要在一年内写一本科学童话诗或科学故事。
    诗人李季和阮章竞已各自完成了一部童话诗。儿童文学作家陈伯吹完成了童话“一只想飞的猫”和小说“毛主席派来的人”的初稿。儿童文学作家管桦今年已写了“木什塔克山的传说”等二十二篇童话，目前又在创作一中篇童话。诗人袁鹰最近已把两年来写的十六首关于少年儿童的诗，以“篝火燃烧的时候”为名辑成一集，交给少年儿童出版社出版，他还在写一篇描写解放前少年先锋队在地下进行革命活动的小说。
