Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The Burmese National Football Delegation, consisting of twenty-five members, who were invited to visit China, left Beijing by train for Wuhan on the evening of the 19th.

That evening, He Long, Vice Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China and Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, hosted a banquet for all members of the delegation. Those attending the banquet included Cai Tingkai, Cai Shufan, Lu Han, and Huang Qixiang, Deputy Directors of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission; Xiao Hua, Rong Gaotang, and Dong Shouyi, Vice Chairmen of the All-China Sports Federation; Di Chaobai, Director of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association; Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing; Chai Zemin, Director of the Beijing Municipal Sports Commission; and Chinese football players. U Maung Maung Toe, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Burmese Embassy in China, was also invited to attend the banquet.

The Burmese National Football Delegation arrived in Beijing on October 14th. During their stay in Beijing, they held two friendly matches with Chinese football teams; visited the Central Institute of Physical Education, the Beijing Gymnasium, and the Yonghe Temple; and toured scenic spots and historical sites such as the Summer Palace and the Forbidden City.

Professor U Ko Gyi, leader of the delegation, told reporters in Beijing his impressions of the visit, saying that the rapid improvement of the level of Chinese football and especially the enthusiasm and friendship of the Chinese people had left a deep impression on him. He said that in the matches, when we attacked and scored, the Chinese audience cheered us even more enthusiastically than when their own team won, a situation that I had rarely seen in the past and that I will never forget.
