Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th -- More than 90% of the 31,000+ agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province have increased production this year compared to local mutual aid teams and individual farmers. The 8,300+ older cooperatives in the Taihang Mountains have all increased production by more than 10% compared to last year. Even in the areas heavily affected by drought, such as Pinglu and Zuoyun counties in northwestern Shanxi, the 1,090 cooperatives there generally achieved 10% to 40% higher yields than local mutual aid teams under the same production conditions. In the cooperatives that achieved increased production, the incomes of members have generally increased. The 837 members of the 12 cooperatives in Ying County, such as Shizhuang, have generally seen their incomes increase by 10% to 20% compared to last year. The Liaoyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangcun Township, Jieyu County, has achieved bumper harvests for three consecutive years, and this year, the income of each member's household has nearly doubled compared to when the cooperative was established in 1953.

\tCooperatives in various areas waged a tenacious struggle against drought during the spring and summer seasons this year. More than 8,000 cooperatives in the Changzhi region collectively dug canals, drilled wells, and raised funds to purchase waterwheels, enabling the irrigation of over 960,000 mu of drought-stricken corn and millet, ensuring good crop growth. This year, the Fengjiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Daren County newly dug a four-li-long canal and 23 earthen wells. After irrigating the long-term drought-stricken 600+ mu of autumn fields, the cooperative completed its annual plan to increase grain production by more than 130,000 jin. Adapting farming systems to local conditions was also an important reason for the increase in production in cooperatives across various areas this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 9th -- The 6,400+ agricultural production cooperatives established in Guizhou Province before the spring plowing this year have overcome various natural disasters in the mountainous areas and achieved increased production. Most of the 500+ agricultural production cooperatives in the Xingyi region have increased production by 20% this year compared to last year, and some have even increased production by 30%. Among the 129 cooperatives in Tongren County, 80% have increased rice and corn production by 30%.

\tMost of the increased production in these agricultural production cooperatives was achieved through many struggles against various natural disasters on the plateau. The eight agricultural production cooperatives in Changshi Township, Dading County, overcame the difficulties of water shortage in the rice paddies during the spring plowing, and now the average production increase is 43%, with every one of the 310 member households seeing increased production. The cornfields of the Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fuxing Township, Yanhe County, located near the river, were blown down by the wind and flooded this summer, followed by more than 40 days of drought. The members carried out replanting and topdressing in the cornfields, and concentrated the cooperative's labor force to carry water to fight the drought, finally increasing grain production by 31%. In early August, the seven cooperatives in Fugui Township, Danzhai Miao Autonomous County, universally discovered insect pests when the rice was heading. Each cooperative continuously captured the pests for ten days, eliminating the pests in 550 mu of paddy fields, and also achieved high production increases.

    战胜自然灾害，改进耕作方法  
    山西贵州农业合作社普遍增产
    新华社太原九日电　山西省三万一千多个农业生产合作社中有百分之九十以上的社今年比当地互助组和个体农民增产。太行山区的八千三百多个老社都比去年增产一成以上；受旱较重的晋西北平鲁、左云等县的一千零九十个合作社，在同样的生产条件下，一般也比当地互助组的产量高百分之十至四十。在获得增产的合作社中，社员的收入普遍增加。应县石庄等十二个合作社的八百三十七户社员一般收入都比去年增加百分之十至二十。解虞县王村乡燎原农业生产合作社连续三年获得丰收，今年每户社员的收入又比一九五三年建社时增加近一倍。
    各地合作社在今年春、夏两季向干旱现象进行了顽强的斗争。长治专区八千多个合作社集体开渠、凿井，集资购买水车，使九十六万多亩受旱的玉米、谷子得到灌溉，保证了作物的良好生长。大仁县冯家庄农业社今年新开了一条四里多长的水渠，打土井二十三眼，长期干旱的六百多亩秋田得到灌溉后，全社完成了全年增产粮食十三万多斤的计划。各地合作社因地制宜地改进了耕作制度，也是今年增产的重要原因。
    新华社贵阳九日电　贵州省今年春耕前建立的六千四百多个农业生产合作社，战胜了山区各种自然灾害，获得增产。兴义专区五百多个农业生产合作社今年绝大部分比去年增产百分之二十，有的还增产百分之三十。铜仁县的一百二十九个社中，有百分之八十的水稻、玉米增产三成。
    这些农业生产合作社的增产大部是同高原上的各种自然灾害作了许多斗争而取得的。大定县长石乡的八个农业生产合作社在春耕中克服了秧田缺水的困难，现在平均增产百分之四十三，三百一十户社员户户增产。沿河县复兴乡红星农业生产合作社靠河边的玉米，在今年夏季被风吹倒和受到水淹，接着又是四十多天的干旱，社员们在玉米田中进行补苗追肥，又集中全社劳动力挑水抗旱，终于使粮食作物增产百分之三十一。丹寨苗族自治县富贵乡的七个社在八月初水稻灌浆时普遍发现虫灾，各社连续捕捉了十天，把五百五十亩稻田的害虫消灭了，也获得高额增产。
