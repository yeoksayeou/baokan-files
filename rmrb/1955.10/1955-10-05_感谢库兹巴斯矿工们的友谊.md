    Thanks to the Friendship of the Kuzbass Miners
    Lin Yongzhuang, Technician of the No. 1 Mine of Hegang Mining Bureau

    The deafening roar of motors rumbles. The towering headframe is lifting coal, black and glistening, from the depths of the earth. This is the scene at the newly commissioned No. 1 Mine (i.e., Dongshan Vertical Shaft) of the Hegang Mining Bureau. Standing before this massive shaft, I cannot suppress the joy and excitement in my heart. Memories pull me back to a year ago. Many past events now resurface in my mind.

    A year ago, we, shouldering the mission entrusted to us by the Party and the people, went with great enthusiasm to our great ally, the Soviet Union, for an internship.

    Our internship was at the Kirov Mine of the Lenin Mining Bureau in the Kuzbass mining area. This is one of the well-known highly mechanized giant mines in the Soviet Union and abroad. Because the workers of this mine frequently overfulfilled their coal production tasks, it had repeatedly won the mobile Red Banner of the Soviet Ministry of the Coal Industry.

    Soviet friends took care of us very thoughtfully. To help us quickly become familiar with Soviet coal mining production technology and further improve our Russian conversation skills, they specially set up a "Chinese Class" in the mining bureau's technical training class. Comrade Keslekin, the director of the training class, personally took charge of our safety regulations course. Each lecture, he patiently used various wall charts, models, and real objects to explain in detail, just like teaching primary school students. Once, when explaining why a large flame should be used first when checking for methane with a Soviet-style safety lamp, he explained it several times, spending a full hour, until everyone understood. Comrade Keslekin had to teach five or six hours a day and also handle the affairs of the training class; but in the evenings, he would always take time out from his rest to come to our dormitories, help us review our lessons, and bring us many reference books. Under their enthusiastic guidance, we quickly graduated from the training class and began our on-site internship.

    Our internship was conducted under the guidance of experienced engineers and veteran miners. Mine Chief Suibunin selected Comrade Chekmaryov, a national Socialist Labor Hero with 30 years of experience and the leader of the first section, Comrade Shirin, winner of the Stalin Prize, Comrade Selyabin, and other famous labor heroes and production innovators to provide guidance.

    During the internship, the Soviet miners showed us meticulous care. Comrade Lian Xiubin was a student of Ventilation Team Leader Kachayev. During the internship, they went down the mine together, and whenever they encountered a piece of equipment, Comrade Kachayev would say its Russian name and explain its use and performance in detail. Comrade Lian Xiubin's Russian was poor, so he would explain it two or three times. If he really didn't understand, Comrade Kachayev would write down everything he wanted to say in Comrade Lian Xiubin's notebook so that he could ask the translation comrade to explain it after going up the mine. He often sat in the office and introduced us to his many years of accumulated mining experience after completing the seven or eight kilometers of roadway inspection work. These conversations often lasted two or three hours. Comrade Kachayev also had very strict requirements for his students. He often patiently guided Comrade Lian Xiubin to carry out various operations on the spot, once, twice, until Lian Xiubin was proficient. Thanks to Comrade Kachayev's enthusiastic guidance, this coal miner, who couldn't even read a word five years ago, has now mastered complex ventilation technology and become an excellent ventilation team leader. There are countless such examples.

    Now we have returned to our motherland. Working in this newly built, huge vertical shaft, I feel unspeakable gratitude and limitless strength whenever I think of the help we received from our Soviet friends. Kuzbass miners, Chinese miners salute you from afar!

    感谢库兹巴斯矿工们的友谊
    鹤岗矿务局新一矿技术员  林永壮
    震天的马达声轰鸣着。耸入高空的井架正在把乌亮闪光的煤炭从地下提出来。这是最近投入生产的鹤岗矿务局新一矿（即东山竖井）的情景。站在这个高大的竖井跟前，我抑止不住心头的喜悦和激动。记忆把我拉回到一年前的时刻。许多往事现在都又重新浮现在我的脑海里了。
    一年前，我们肩负着党和人民所给予的使命，满怀着热情到伟大的盟邦苏联去实习。
    我们实习的地方是库兹巴斯矿区列宁矿务局基洛夫矿井。这是苏联国内外著名的高度机械化的巨型矿井之一。由于这个矿井的工人经常超额完成产煤任务，曾多次荣获苏联煤矿工业部的流动红旗。
    苏联朋友对我们照顾得非常周到。为了帮助我们很快地熟悉苏联煤矿的生产技术和进一步提高俄语会话能力，他们特别为我们在矿务局的技术训练班里设立了一个“中国班”。训练班主任刻斯雷金同志亲自担任我们的保安规程课。每次讲课，他总是像教小学生那样耐心地利用各种挂图、模型和实物详细讲解。有一次在解释用苏式安全灯检查沼气为什么首先要用大火焰时，他一连讲了几遍，费了整整一小时，直到大家都明白了为止。刻斯雷金同志一天要担任五、六小时课，还要处理训练班的事务；但是在晚间，他总是还要抽出休息时间到我们宿舍里来，帮助我们复习功课，给我们送来许多参考书。在他们的热心教导下，我们很快地从训练班毕业出来，开始了现场实习。
    我们的实习是在富有经验的工程师和老矿工们指导下进行的。井长绥布宁同志挑选了有三十年工龄的全苏社会主义劳动英雄、第一段段长车克马辽夫同志、荣获斯大林奖金的史林同志、谢良宾同志以及其他一些著名的劳动英雄和生产革新者来进行指导。
    在实习过程中，苏联的矿工同志们对我们的关怀是无微不至的。廉修斌同志是通风班长卡恰耶夫的学生。在实习中，他们一起下井，每遇到一种设备，卡恰耶夫同志便说出它的俄文名称，详细地介绍它的用途和性能。廉修斌同志的俄文较差，有时他就讲解两遍或三遍。实在不懂时，卡恰耶夫同志就把要说的一切都记在廉修斌的小本子上，以便升井后请翻译同志解释。他常常在作完了七、八公里路的巷道检查工作后，还坐在办公室里向我们介绍他多年来所积累的矿山工作经验。这种谈话往往持续两、三小时。卡恰耶夫同志对学生的要求也非常严格。他常常不厌其烦地指导廉修斌同志实地进行各种操作，一次，两次，直到廉修斌熟练了为止。由于卡恰耶夫同志的热心指导，这个五年前连一个大字也不识的挖煤工人，现在已掌握了复杂的通风技术，成为一个优秀的通风班长。像这样的例子真是不胜枚举的。
    现在我们回到了祖国。在新建成的这个巨大的竖井里工作。每想到苏联朋友对我们的帮助，便有说不出的感激，也产生了无限的力量。库兹巴斯的矿工同志们呵，中国的矿工们在遥远的地方向你们致敬！
