    The sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is here. This year is the third year of implementing our country's First Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy. The complete realization of the First Five-Year Plan will lay a preliminary and good foundation for the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country.
    The execution of the first two years of the Five-Year Plan – 1953 and 1954, as well as the first half of 1955 – shows that the awakened Chinese people, under the leadership of the long-tested Chinese Communist Party and with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, are fully capable of victoriously completing, and even overfulfilling, the plans formulated by the state. The implementation of the Five-Year Plan for two and a half years has been generally good. The total output value of industry and agriculture increased by 14.4 percent in 1953 compared with 1952, and by another 9.4 percent in 1954 compared with 1953. The average annual increase of 11.9 percent exceeded the average annual growth rate of 8.6 percent stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. The total output value of all industrial enterprises – state-owned, cooperative-operated, joint state-private, and private – in the first half of 1955 reached 102 percent of the plan for the first half of the year, an increase of 8 percent compared with the first half of 1954. Among them, the output value of state-owned enterprises increased by 14 percent. In terms of transportation, commerce, culture, education, and healthcare, the annual plans for the first two years of the Five-Year Plan were successfully completed. Basic construction plans have also been nearly completed each year.
    The development of agricultural production cooperatives has exceeded the state's plan every year. In December 1951, there were only over three hundred agricultural production cooperatives nationwide. However, in just two years, by December 1953, they had developed forty-six times, reaching more than fourteen thousand cooperatives. From the winter of 1953 to the autumn of 1954, the original plan was to increase by one and a half times, but the actual result was an increase of more than seven times, reaching one hundred thousand cooperatives. From October 1954 to the first half of 1955, the original plan was to develop to six hundred thousand cooperatives, but in reality, it developed to six hundred and fifty thousand cooperatives (this is still the number after consolidation and reduction). More than 90 percent of these rapidly developing cooperatives are consolidated, and about 80 percent have increased production. The proportion of increased production ranges from 10 percent to 30 percent, and even more in individual cases. Currently, a new upsurge of socialist transformation, namely the agricultural cooperativization movement, is about to arrive in the rural areas across the country.
    These many facts vividly and profoundly illustrate the superiority and infinite vitality of our people's democratic system. This system can fully mobilize and concentrate the production enthusiasm, patriotism, and socialist fervor of the 600 million people, turning them into a magnificent force. As long as we can fully leverage the superiority of our people's democratic system, we will definitely be able to guarantee the successful completion, and strive for the overfulfillment, of the state plan for the second half of this year and the next two years.
    This year's agricultural harvest will be the best in nearly three years. The bumper harvest of agriculture will promote the growth of industrial production and the activity of the market, and enable the broad masses of farmers to further enhance their production enthusiasm, with better harvests, lighter burdens, and increased income, making it possible to strive for greater increases in crop and livestock production next year. On the basis of the growth of industrial and agricultural production, the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and at home and abroad will be further developed, and the scale of basic construction will also expand, and the speed will also accelerate. This is foreseeable.
    In order to make our socialist cause advance faster and victoriously complete and overfulfill the Five-Year Plan, we must intensify our efforts in all aspects.
    In the industrial sector, we must further improve our technical level, strengthen management, especially strengthen the leadership of trial production and production of new products, vigorously develop raw material resources, save raw materials, and strive to increase production on the premise of increasing new products and improving product quality. For private industries, we must implement arrangements by industry and trade, appropriately increase processing orders, and solve their difficulties in raw materials, production, and sales, so that they can maintain relatively normal production during the socialist transformation process, which is necessary for the comprehensive completion of the industrial production plan. In terms of basic construction, we have accumulated construction experience over the past few years, and the strength of design and construction has also been continuously strengthened, which are favorable conditions. In the future, we must better arrange the progress of design and construction, better balance the design and construction forces according to the tasks, formulate more specific systems and indicators for savings, and at the same time, effectively ensure the quality of projects.
    We must continue to strengthen ideological education and political work among the workers and staff, and continuously improve the class consciousness, patriotic enthusiasm, and socialist enthusiasm of the workers and staff, so that everyone can fully exert the sense of responsibility and high creative spirit of being the masters of the country and the leading class. In the past, many outstanding heroic and model figures have emerged on the production and construction front, powerfully promoting our country's socialist construction cause. We must systematically educate the broad masses of workers and staff with the deeds of these outstanding figures, organize the broad masses of workers and staff to learn from their examples, and strive to make greater contributions to the country and the people.
    While improving the awareness of the workers and staff, we must also continuously learn and apply advanced experience. In recent years, the broad masses of workers and staff in our country have learned a lot of advanced production technology and enterprise management experience from the great Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. But our knowledge and experience in this regard is still far from enough. We must continue to intensify our efforts to learn all advanced experience, and at the same time, we must also learn from the existing advanced experience in the country, study and summarize the experience in our own enterprises, turn these experiences into systematic knowledge, so that we can do better in all aspects such as formulating plans, organizing implementation, supervising and inspecting implementation, correcting deviations and correcting shortcomings at any time.
    In the agricultural sector, we must intensify the socialist transformation of agriculture, accelerate the development of semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives, and change the scattered individual management into unified and larger-scale management. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, who account for 60 to 70 percent of the rural population, warmly support agricultural production cooperatives, and their enthusiasm and initiative for taking the socialist road are very high. We must meet the requirements of the broad masses of farmers.
    At the same time, we must also vigorously organize land reclamation, expand the area of cultivated land, actively develop small-scale farmland water conservancy in various places, actively develop fertilizer sources, promote new farm tools, and improve cultivation techniques to increase the yield per unit area. In the allocation of the planting area of various crops, we must also actively guide farmers to plant according to the state plan, on the one hand, taking into account the appropriate expansion of the planting area of high-yield crops such as corn, and on the other hand, also ensuring the planting area of various technical crops (such as cotton, flue-cured tobacco, sugar cane, sugar beet, peanuts, rapeseed, etc.) needed by the state, and strive to comprehensively complete the agricultural production plan.
    Our people, in order to build their own happy life and great socialist motherland, and in order to smoothly realize the Five-Year Plan, eagerly hope to maintain lasting peace in the Far East and the world. The preamble to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China once clearly stipulated based on the will of the people: "In international affairs, our country's unwavering policy is to strive for the noble purpose of world peace and human progress." In recent years, the government and people of our country have worked together with the governments and people of many peace-loving countries to strive to ease the tense situation in the Far East and the world in various ways, and have achieved many successes. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by the Prime Ministers of China and India and China and Burma have been jointly recognized by twenty-nine countries with different social and political systems at the Asian-African Conference and are reflected in the agreements of the Asian-African Conference. Our country's peaceful diplomatic policy has been gradually understood by the people of Asian and African countries and even the world. On the basis of mutual understanding, our country has signed trade agreements with the governments of Indonesia, Burma, and Egypt, as well as Japanese non-governmental organizations, and has conducted cultural exchanges with more countries. Recently, the ambassadorial-level talks between our country and the United States have reached an agreement on the first agenda item. If the United States is truly sincere, then other issues between China and the United States, and even the issue of easing tensions in the Taiwan region, can be resolved.
    For world peace, our government firmly supports the Soviet Union's proposal on banning atomic weapons and reducing armaments of all countries. In fact, more than four million soldiers of our army have been demobilized and returned to their hometowns to participate in peaceful industrial and agricultural production labor, and participate in the great socialist construction and socialist transformation cause. However, the people of our country and the existing armed forces should absolutely not relax their political vigilance and efforts to build a strong and modern national defense. On the contrary, for peace, for socialism, for ensuring national security and the happiness of the people, and for liberating our sacred territory of Taiwan, we must still continuously strengthen the construction of modern national defense and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements from the country.
    On the occasion of celebrating the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we call on the people of the whole country to work harder in all aspects around the great goal of socialism, in order to complete our country's First Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy.

### 第六届国庆节和我们的任务

    第六届国庆节和我们的任务
    中华人民共和国成立六周年了。这一年是我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划执行的第三年。第一个五年计划的全部实现，将为我国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业打下初步的良好的基础。
    五年计划的最初两年——一九五三年和一九五四年，以及一九五五年前半年执行的情况表明，觉醒了的中国人民，在久经考验的中国共产党的领导下，在苏联和各人民民主国家兄弟般的援助下，是完全能够胜利地完成甚至超额完成国家所制定的计划的。五年计划执行两年半的情况基本上是良好的。工农业的总产值在一九五三年比一九五二年增长了百分之十四点四，一九五四年又比一九五三年增长了百分之九点四。平均每年增长百分之十一点九，超过了五年计划所规定的平均每年增长百分之八点六的速度。国营、合作社营、公私合营和私营的全部工业企业一九五五年上半年的总产值，达到了上半年计划的百分之一百零二，比一九五四年上半年增长了百分之八。其中国营的产值增长了百分之十四。在交通运输方面、商业方面、文化教育和保健方面，五年计划的最初两年都胜利完成了年度计划。基本建设计划每年也都接近完成。
    农业生产合作社的发展，每年都超过了国家的计划。一九五一年十二月，全国的农业生产合作社还只有三百多个。但仅仅过了两年，到一九五三年十二月，就发展了四十六倍，达到了一万四千多个社。一九五三年冬到一九五四年秋，原计划发展一倍半，但执行的结果却发展了七倍多，达到了十万个社。一九五四年十月到一九五五年前半年，原计划要发展到六十万个社，实际却发展到了六十五万个社（这还是经过了整理和缩减以后的数目）。这些迅速发展起来的合作社，有百分之九十以上是巩固的，有百分之八十左右都增产了。增产的比例，从百分之十到百分之三十，个别的还更多。目前在全国农村中，一个社会主义改造的运动即农业合作化运动的新高潮就要到来了。
    这许多事实生动而深刻地说明了我国人民民主制度的优越性和无穷无尽的生命力。这种制度能够把六亿人民的生产积极性和爱国主义、社会主义的热情充分地发动起来，集中起来，变成了雄伟的力量。只要我们能够充分地发挥我国人民民主制度的优越性，我们就一定能够保证今年下半年和今后两年国家计划的胜利完成，并争取超额完成。
    今年农业的收成，将是近三年来最好的一年。农业的丰收，将促进工业生产的增长和市场的活跃，并使广大农民在收成较好、负担减轻、收入增加的情况下，生产积极性更加提高，使明年农作物和家畜有可能争取更多的增产。在工农业生产增长的基础上，城乡和内外的物资交流将有进一步的发展，基本建设的规模也将扩大，速度也将加快。这是可以预期的。
    为了使我国社会主义事业更快地前进，胜利地完成和超额完成五年计划，我们必须从各方面加紧努力。
    在工业方面，我们要进一步提高技术水平，加强管理，特别加强对新产品的试制和生产的领导，在增加新产品和提高产品质量的前提下，大力开辟原料资源，节约原材料，努力增产。对于私营工业，要实行逐行逐业的安排，适当增加加工定货，解决它们在原料、生产和销售方面的困难，使它们在社会主义改造过程中维持比较正常的生产，这对于工业生产计划的全面完成是必要的。在基本建设方面，我们有了几年来积累的建设经验，设计和施工的力量也不断地壮大了，这是有利的条件。今后我们必须更好地安排设计和施工的进度，更好地按照任务平衡设计和施工的力量，更具体地定出节约的制度和指标，同时切实保证工程的质量。
    必须继续加强对职工群众的思想教育和政治工作，不断地提高职工群众的阶级觉悟、爱国热情和社会主义积极性，使每一个人都能充分发挥国家主人翁和领导阶级的责任感和高度的创造精神。过去在生产建设的战线上已经出现了许许多多杰出的英雄模范人物，有力地推进了我国的社会主义建设事业。我们必须有计划地以这些杰出人物的事迹来教育广大职工，组织广大职工学习他们的榜样，争取对国家对人民作出更大的贡献。
    在提高职工群众觉悟程度的同时，还必须不断地学习和运用先进的经验。几年来，我国广大的职工群众向伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家学习了许多先进的生产技术和管理企业的经验。但我们在这方面的知识和经验仍然是十分不够的。我们必须继续加紧努力学习一切先进的经验，同时也要学习国内已有的先进经验，研究和总结自己企业中的经验，把这些经验变成系统的知识，使自己在制定计划、组织执行和监督检查执行情况、随时纠正偏向和改正缺点等各方面，都能作得更好。
    在农业方面，我们必须加紧对农业实行社会主义改造，加紧发展半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社，把分散的个体经营改变为统一的较大规模的经营。占农村人口百分之六七十的广大贫农和下中农热烈拥护农业生产合作社，他们对于走社会主义道路的热情和积极性是很高的。我们必须满足广大农民的这个要求。
    同时，我们还必须大力组织开荒，扩大耕地面积，并在各地积极发展小型的农田水利，积极开辟肥源，推广新式农具，改进耕作技术，以增加单位面积产量。在分配各种农作物的播种面积上，也要积极指导农民按照国家计划进行种植，一方面照顾到玉米等高产作物播种面积的适当扩大，另一方面也要使国家所需要的各种技术作物（如棉花、烤烟、甘蔗、甜菜、花生、油菜等）的播种面积有所保证，争取全面地完成农业生产计划。
    我国人民为了建设自己幸福的生活和伟大的社会主义祖国，为了顺利地实现五年计划，热烈地希望保持远东和世界的持久和平。中华人民共和国宪法的序言曾经依据人民的这种意愿，明确地规定：“在国际事务中，我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。”近年来，我国政府和人民曾经同爱好和平的许多国家的政府和人民一道，从各方面努力来争取缓和远东和世界的紧张局势，并且获得了不少的成就。中印、中缅总理共同倡导的和平共处的五项原则，已经在亚非会议中取得二十九个社会政治制度不同的国家的共同承认，体现在亚非会议的协议中。我国的和平外交政策，已经逐渐为亚非各国以至全世界人民所了解。在相互了解的基础上，我国同印度尼西亚、缅甸、埃及各国政府以及日本的民间团体签订了贸易协定，并且同更多的国家进行了文化的交流。最近我国同美国举行的大使级谈判已就第一项议程达成了协议。如果美国真正具有诚意，那末中美两国之间的其他问题以至缓和台湾地区紧张局势的问题，都是可以解决的。
    为了世界和平，我国政府坚决支持苏联关于禁止原子武器和裁减各国军备的建议。事实上，我国军队已经有四百多万人复原还乡，参加了和平的工农业生产劳动，参加了伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业。但是，我国人民和现有的武装部队都绝对不应该放松自己的政治警惕和建设强大的现代化国防的努力。相反的，为了和平，为了社会主义，为了保障国家的安全和人民的幸福，为了解放我国的神圣领土台湾，我们仍然必须不断地加强现代化国防的建设，并且从国内肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    在庆祝中华人民共和国成立六周年的今天，我们号召全国人民围绕着社会主义这一伟大目标，为完成我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划而从各方面加紧努力。
