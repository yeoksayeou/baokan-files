Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao from the Second Session of the First People's Congress of Xinjiang Province

To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, our respected Chairman Mao:

    The establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region on October 1st is another great victory for the ethnic policies of the Communist Party of China and yourself, and a great joyful event for the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The people of all ethnic groups feel infinite joy and inspiration. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang deeply realize that the leadership of the Communist Party and yourself is the guarantee for the victory of the revolution and socialist construction of the people of all ethnic groups. We will continue to unite more closely with the people of the whole country under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and yourself. We will work together with one heart and one mind, increase production, practice strict economy, develop the political, economic and cultural construction of the people of all ethnic groups, support the socialist construction of the great motherland, and gradually realize our great aspiration—a socialist society. On behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, we extend to you our heartfelt and infinite respect!

                                        September 30, 1955
