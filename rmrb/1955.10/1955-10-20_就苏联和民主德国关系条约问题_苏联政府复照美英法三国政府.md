Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 19th (TASS dispatch): The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered similar notes to the embassies of the United States, Britain, and France in Moscow on October 18th, replying to the notes sent by the three governments to the Soviet government on October 3rd regarding the negotiations held between the Soviet government and the government of the German Democratic Republic in September this year.

In their note of October 3rd, the three governments stated that they believed that the "Treaty on Relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the German Democratic Republic," signed in Moscow on September 20th, could not affect the obligations or responsibilities assumed by the Soviet Union under the agreements and arrangements concerning Germany (including Berlin) previously signed by France, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union.

In its note of October 18th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that, according to the aforementioned treaty, relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic were resolved on the basis of complete equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. The treaty stated that the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic would cooperate to ensure peace and security in Europe, to peacefully negotiate solutions to problems, and to restore Germany's unity on a peaceful and democratic basis.

The Soviet note then pointed out that the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, when signing the treaty on relations between the two countries, proceeded from the standpoint that the German Democratic Republic exercised legal rights within the territory under its sovereignty, which naturally included the lines of communication within this territory.

The Soviet note further stated that, as for the issue of regulating the movement of military personnel and materials of the British, French, and American garrison forces stationed in West Berlin between the Federal Republic of Germany and West Berlin, the governments of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic agreed during negotiations that this regulation would be temporarily carried out by the command of the Soviet forces stationed in Germany until a corresponding agreement was reached.

The Soviet note concluded by pointing out that the governments of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, when signing the aforementioned treaty, took into consideration the obligations assumed by both parties under international agreements concerning Germany as a whole.

    就苏联和民主德国关系条约问题
    苏联政府复照美英法三国政府
    新华社十九日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：苏联外交部在十月十八日分别以内容相似的照会交给美、英、法三国驻莫斯科大使馆，答复三国政府十月三日就苏联政府和德意志民主共和国政府今年九月举行的谈判致苏联政府的照会。
    三国政府在十月三日的照会中说，三国政府认为，九月二十日在莫斯科签订的“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和德意志民主共和国关系条约”不能影响苏联按照法国、美国、联合王国和苏联以前所签订的关于德国（其中包括柏林）的协议和各项协定所承担的义务或责任。
    苏联外交部在十八日的照会中声明说，根据上述条约，苏联和德意志民主共和国的关系在完全平等、互相尊重主权和互不干涉内政的基础上得到解决。这一条约载明苏联和德意志民主共和国为保证和平和欧洲安全，为和平协商解决问题和在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国的统一而合作。
    苏联照会接着指出，苏联和德意志民主共和国在签订两国关系条约时的出发点是：德意志民主共和国在属于它的主权范围以内的领土上行使法权，这当然也包括这个领土上的交通线在内。
    苏联照会又说，至于对英、法、美三国驻在西柏林的警备部队的军事人员和物资在德意志联邦共和国和西柏林之间的往来运输的管制的问题，苏联和德意志民主共和国两国政府在谈判时议定，这一管制在达成相应的协议以前暂由驻德苏军部队的司令部执行。
    苏联照会最后指出，苏联和德意志民主共和国两国政府在签订上述条约时注意到了双方根据有关整个德国的国际协定所承担的义务。
