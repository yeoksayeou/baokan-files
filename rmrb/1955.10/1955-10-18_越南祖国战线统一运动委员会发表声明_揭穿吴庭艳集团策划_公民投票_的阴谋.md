Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 17th. The Vietnam Fatherland Front Unified Movement Committee issued a statement on the 16th, exposing and condemning the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's conspiracy to hold a "referendum" scheduled for October 23rd.

The statement pointed out that the performance of the "referendum" farce is intended to elevate Ngo Dinh Diem to the position of "President" and to formulate a "Constitution" and elect a separate "National Assembly." Ngo Dinh Diem's conspiracy is to establish a separate state in South Vietnam in order to use the South to oppose the North, divide the Vietnamese people, and partition the motherland. This is a brazen violation of the Geneva Accords. It is a further step in implementing the US imperialist conspiracy to maintain the division of Vietnam and undermine Vietnamese unification. The statement said that in order to stage its "referendum" farce, the South Vietnamese authorities are fanatically mobilizing their government machinery, propaganda machinery, army, and police forces to carry out a reign of terror against all those who disagree with their conspiracy to deceive the people. The purpose of the aforementioned fraudulent "referendum" is obviously to legitimize the dictatorial and fascist regime in South Vietnam.

The statement said that the Ngo Dinh Diem regime's conspiracy is completely inconsistent with the wishes of the Vietnamese people.

The statement called on all Vietnamese people to unite more closely and resolutely oppose the US imperialists and Ngo Dinh Diem in staging a "referendum" farce in South Vietnam.

The statement finally condemned the US imperialists and Ngo Dinh Diem's conspiracy to undermine peace, undermine Vietnamese unification, and undermine the Geneva Accords to the people and public opinion of the world, and demanded that the people and public opinion of the world actively support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to consolidate peace and achieve the unification of Vietnam.

    越南祖国战线统一运动委员会发表声明
    揭穿吴庭艳集团策划“公民投票”的阴谋
    新华社河内十七日电　越南祖国战线统一运动委员会十六日发表声明，揭露和谴责吴庭艳集团预定在十月二十三日举行的“公民投票”的阴谋。
    声明指出，“公民投票”滑稽剧的演出是为了要借此把吴庭艳抬高到“总统”的地位和制定“宪法”以及选出一个单独的“国会”。吴庭艳的阴谋是要在越南南方建立一个单独的国家，以便用南方来反对北方，分裂越南人民和分割祖国。这是一种厚颜无耻地违反日内瓦协议的行动。这是执行美帝国主义保持越南分裂状态和破坏越南统一的阴谋的进一步的步骤。声明说：为了演出它的“公民投票”的滑稽剧，越南南方当局正在狂热地动员它的政府机器、宣传机器、军队和警察部队，以对所有不同意它们这种欺骗人民的阴谋的人实行恐怖统治。上述骗人的“公民投票”的目的，显然是要使越南南方的独裁和法西斯政权合法化。
    声明说：吴庭艳政权的阴谋是完全不符合越南人民的愿望的。
    声明呼吁全体越南人民更加紧密地团结起来，坚决反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳在越南南方演出“公民投票”滑稽剧。
    声明最后向世界各国人民和舆论谴责美帝国主义和吴庭艳的破坏和平、破坏越南统一和破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋，并且要求世界各国人民和舆论积极支持越南人民的正义斗争，以巩固和平和实现越南的统一。
