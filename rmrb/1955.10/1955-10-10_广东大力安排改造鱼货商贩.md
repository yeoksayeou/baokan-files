The Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company and local supply and marketing cooperatives have this year arranged and transformed more than 80% of the province's private fishmongers. Among the more than 26,000 private fishmonger households in the province, more than 6,600 have established relationships such as consignment, distribution, and wholesale purchase with state-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives. After arrangement and transformation, the business enthusiasm of the vast number of private fishmongers has been further enhanced, and turnover has generally increased. The business volume of the Taicheng salted fish industry in western Guangdong in February of this year was more than 4,900 yuan, and after arrangements were made in May, it rose to more than 9,500 yuan. In the first half of this year, the sales volume of private fishmongers in Guangdong Province increased by 82.31% compared with the same period in 1954, reaching 45.02% of the total fish sales in the province in the first half of the year, playing the role of an assistant to state-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives.

    广东大力安排改造鱼货商贩
    广东省水产供销公司和各地供销合作社今年已经对全省百分之八十以上的私营鱼货商贩进行了安排改造；全省二万六千多户私营鱼货商贩中，同国营公司、供销合作社建立了代销、经销、批购等关系的已经有六千六百多户。经过安排改造，广大私营鱼货商贩的经营积极性进一步提高，营业额普遍上升。粤西台城咸鱼行业今年二月份的营业额是四千九百多元，五月份经过安排后上升到九千五百多元。今年上半年，广东省私营鱼货商贩的销货量比一九五四年同期增加了百分之八十二点三一，达到全省上半年鱼货总销售量的百分之四十五点零二，发挥了国营公司和供销合作社的助手的作用。
