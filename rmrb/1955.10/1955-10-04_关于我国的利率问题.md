On the Issue of Interest Rates in Our Country
    Yang Peixin
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the nature and role of interest rates have undergone fundamental changes. In old China, interest rates were a form of usury used by the four major families, warlords, bureaucrats, and landlords to amass funds, wage civil wars, accumulate wealth, and exploit the people. In new China, interest rates are an important economic weapon used by the Chinese people to concentrate funds, support the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, consolidate the economic accounting system of enterprises, and accelerate capital accumulation.

    Interest rates in old China remained at a very high level for a long time. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the average annual interest rate for urban bank loans was 10% to 16% (i.e., borrowing 100 yuan from a bank required paying 10 to 16 yuan in interest per year), far higher than in general capitalist countries. In rural areas of old China, even more horrifying usury prevailed. "Three cents per month" for money and "five cents per month" for grain were the most common interest rates, with even higher rates known as "doubling," "compounding," and "snowballing." For example, a landlord in Qingpu Village, Minhou Fourth District, Fujian, would lend grain to farmers during the lean season and collect it at harvest time, charging 80 catties of interest for every 100 catties borrowed. Landlords in Chaijiazhuang, Weixian County, Shandong, lent one dou of wheat before the harvest and demanded one and a half to two dou in return after the harvest. Landlords on Hengsha Island, Chuansha County, Jiangsu, charged interest rates of 100% to 120%.

    Why did interest rates in old China remain at such high levels for so long? This was because the reactionary Nationalist government was the main recipient of bank loans, borrowing funds at high interest rates through political loans and the issuance of government bonds to support the civil war. At that time, the annual interest rate for political loans was as high as 20% to 30%. The nominal interest rate for government bonds was 6% to 8% per year, but since the bonds were sold at a 50% or 60% discount (paying only 50 or 60 yuan in cash for a 100 yuan bond), the actual interest earned was 6 to 8 yuan for every 50 or 60 yuan invested. Moreover, those who won the lottery also received 100 yuan of principal for an outlay of 60 yuan. Overall, the actual interest rate for government bonds was 30% to 40%. This drove up overall social interest rates. According to the Marxist political economy principle that interest is a portion of profit and that the interest rate is determined by the profit rate and spontaneously adjusted based on the supply and demand of loan capital, in old China, the main recipients of bank loans were not capitalist industry and commerce but the four major families. Therefore, the interest rate was not determined by the profit rate of capitalist industry and commerce but by the much higher profit rate obtained by the four major families in the civil war. The continuous civil wars waged by the four major families led them to constantly amass funds, creating a long-term situation where the demand for loan capital exceeded supply, which also contributed to high interest rates.

    Who benefited from this phenomenon of high interest rates? Mainly the four major families, warlords, bureaucrats, and landlords. Because bank loan interest rates were so high, general capitalist industry and commerce could not afford such loans. Therefore, bank funds could only be used by the four major families as capital to launch civil wars, seize territory, and pursue huge profits. At the same time, it caused the financial capital of old China to be mired in government bond speculation and political loans for a long time, creating a dependence on the four major families. Who benefited from high deposit interest rates? Before the war, the largest bank depositors were not industry and commerce, but so-called private individuals and private groups. The so-called private individuals were mainly bureaucratic capitalists, warlords, bureaucrats, and landlords. They deposited their exploited wealth in banks, often in amounts of hundreds of thousands or millions of yuan at a time. Landlords who fled from the countryside to the cities also deposited the wealth they had accumulated through generations of exploiting farmers in banks. The so-called private group deposits were mainly public funds of warlords and bureaucrats. They could only earn an annual interest rate of 2% on deposits in foreign banks, but they could earn an annual interest rate of about 7.5% on deposits in domestic banks. In reality, the financial capital of old China served to concentrate the "private savings" and "public funds" of bureaucratic capitalists, warlords, bureaucrats, and landlords to support the four major families in launching civil wars, pursuing huge profits, and then distributing some crumbs from the four major families.

    Who suffered from this phenomenon of high interest rates? The national economy, the development of productive forces, and the vast majority of the people. High urban interest rates stifled the development of national capitalist industry and commerce. Japanese yarn factories in China could borrow funds from Japanese banks at an annual interest rate of only 6% or 7%, while Chinese yarn factories had to pay interest rates of over 10% to borrow from banks, putting them at a disadvantage in competition. The Chinese Cotton Mill Owners Association declared in 1927: "Domestic finance has high loan interest rates. Manufacturers work hard to repay the principal and interest owed to banks and money shops, but they are still worried about not being able to repay enough. Over time, the debt compounds, and the only solution is to sell the factory." High urban interest rates further fueled the development of rural usury. Farmers were not only subjected to heavy exploitation but also to heavy interest. Usury interest rates reached 30%, 50%, 80%, 100%, or even 120%, which agricultural production could not bear, inevitably leading to the bankruptcy of farmers. Once a farmer incurred debt, the interest grew, and the interest was added to the principal. In less than three or four years, his houses and land were seized by the landlords. Urban usury (such as loan sharking) and pawnshops were also a brutal form of exploitation of the urban poor. Therefore, high interest rates were detrimental to the masses of the people.

    After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, interest rates in old China experienced an even more distorted surge. Shortly after the reactionary Nationalist government issued gold yuan in 1948, interest rates reached 120% per month, and at the highest point, they reached 600%. This was a manifestation of the extremely serious military, political, economic, and monetary crisis of the reactionary Nationalist government, which was on the verge of total collapse. The reactionary Nationalist government had consciously induced market interest rates to rise since 1942, adopting a high-interest rate policy toward enterprises run by the national bourgeoisie and promoting the bankruptcy of the national bourgeoisie to benefit the expansion of Chinese bureaucratic capitalism.

    High interest rates in old China were the result of the Chinese bureaucratic bourgeoisie and warlords, bureaucrats, and landlords controlling factories, mines, land, and also finance and banks, making them serve their interests. On the issue of interest rates, the fundamental opposition between the rule of Chinese bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism and the interests of the Chinese people was also exposed. The Chinese people had to overthrow the rule of Chinese bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism and abolish their ownership of the means of production in order to smoothly resolve this problem and eliminate the usury that stifled production.

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, interest rates have gradually declined. Because we confiscated the factories, mines, and banking institutions of the bureaucratic capitalists, confiscated the land of the landlords, and curbed price increases, we eliminated the socio-economic foundation for the existence of urban and rural usury in old China. At the same time, under the leadership of the people's government, the state bank was established, credit cooperatives were developed, and capitalist finance was managed. The country's finance and prices achieved unprecedented stability, making it possible for the state to lead the decline in interest rates in a planned way. In accordance with the Party's general line for the transition period, our country's interest rates adopted the principle of gradual decline and differentiated treatment. Interest rates must be gradually reduced in order to promote the development of industrial, agricultural, and handicraft production and commodity circulation and to realize the country's socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization. Differentiated treatment must be adopted in order to correctly reflect the state's policies toward enterprises of different economic components and toward different classes. The interest rate on loans to socialist enterprises should be set lower, and units that seriously implement the economic accounting system should be encouraged (such as running settlement loans with lower interest rates), and units with poor management should be supervised (such as adding 10% interest on overdue loans). Lower interest rates should be stipulated for loans to farmers and handicraftsmen in order to implement the worker-peasant alliance policy and encourage the development of agricultural and handicraft production. It is stipulated that the interest rate on loans to agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams is lower than that for individual farmers, and the interest rate on equipment loans is lower than that for general production loans, in order to encourage the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts and the gradual adoption of new equipment. In order to support poor peasants, it is stipulated that the interest rate on loans to extremely poor households should be lower. In order to support poor peasants to actively participate in agricultural production cooperatives, a very low-interest rate poverty alleviation cooperative fund loan is stipulated. Efforts should be made to guide capitalist financial institutions to consistently and gradually reduce loan interest rates in order to encourage the legitimate operation of industry and commerce. The interest rate on loans to joint state-private enterprises should be lower than the interest rate on loans to private enterprises in order to encourage the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Slightly higher interest rates are stipulated for savings as a material encouragement from the state to the people's savings.

    The state bank has consistently led the decline in interest rates. At the beginning of the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, the market interest rate was relatively high, with loan interest rates reaching 6% to 9% per month. The People's Bank stipulated very low deposit and loan interest rates for state-owned enterprises and relatively low loan interest rates for capitalist industry and commerce, influencing the decline in market interest rates. After the national unification of financial and economic work and the curbing of price increases in March 1950, the People's Bank led and supervised capitalist financial institutions to rapidly and resolutely reduce interest rates in order to consolidate the stability of prices. In June 1952, on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements nationwide, interest rates were reduced again to cooperate with the activation of the market. After the Party put forward the general line for the transition period, in October 1953, the loan interest rates for socialist enterprises were emphatically reduced. After the announcement of the First Five-Year Plan, in October 1955, the state bank comprehensively reduced loan, deposit, and savings interest rates to continue to support the country's socialist industrialization, strive to meet the upcoming high tide of national agricultural collectivization, practice thrift, and consolidate the economic accounting system of enterprises.

    After repeated reductions over the past six years, our country's interest rates have been reduced from a market interest rate of 6% to 9% per month to the current level of about 1% per month, completely sweeping away the remaining traces of usury left over from the period before the War of Resistance Against Japan and the period of inflation in old China.

    The loan and deposit interest rates for socialist enterprises were set relatively low from the beginning, and they have been the first to decline over the past six years. This time, further reductions have been made. The vast majority of the working capital of socialist enterprises is lent by the state bank. The state bank provides a large number of low-interest loans, giving socialist enterprises a superior position in terms of the quantity and conditions of capital supply, which is conducive to the development of socialist enterprises and the increasing consolidation of the advantages of the socialist economy. This time, the reduction in interest rates has saved socialist enterprises hundreds of millions of yuan in interest expenses, which is a favorable factor in reducing product costs, reducing commodity circulation costs, accelerating capital accumulation, and consolidating the economic accounting system of enterprises.

    In order to support farmers, effectively combat usury, and develop agricultural production, the state bank has been issuing low-interest agricultural loans in rural areas since the War of Resistance Against Japan. This time, the state bank reduced the monthly interest rate on loans to agricultural production cooperatives to 0.6%, the monthly interest rate on poverty alleviation cooperative fund loans to 0.4%, the monthly interest rate on production loans to individual farmers to 0.9%, the monthly interest rate on loans to agricultural mutual aid teams and equipment loans to 0.75%, and the monthly interest rate on loans to extremely poor households, disaster areas, old revolutionary base areas, farm households in minority nationality areas, military dependents, and families of martyrs to 0.75%. The interest rates of credit cooperatives have also been significantly reduced. The state bank has nearly 20,000 business offices in districts and towns, and credit cooperatives have developed to more than 150,000 in rural areas. According to the greatly reduced interest rates this winter, more than 1 billion yuan of low-interest agricultural loans will be invested in rural areas next spring, which is an important step in meeting the high tide of agricultural collectivization. The large number of low-interest production loans, poverty alleviation cooperative fund loans, and equipment loans to agricultural production cooperatives will provide strong support for agricultural production cooperatives to adopt new modern agricultural tools and technologies and develop agricultural production. At the same time, rural usury will be dealt a devastating blow, and credit cooperatives will be wholeheartedly supported by poor farmers and further consolidated in terms of organization and business.

    This time, the interest rates on loans to handicraft production cooperatives, handicraft supply and marketing production cooperatives and production groups, individual handicraftsmen, and independent small traders have also been reduced and adjusted, implementing the policy of developing handicraft production and carrying out the socialist transformation of handicrafts.

    The interest rate on loans to capitalist industry and commerce has also been reduced and adjusted this time. This is conducive to the beneficial operation of capitalist industry and commerce for the national economy and the people's livelihood, and it is also conducive to the stability of prices. Lower interest rates on loans to joint state-private enterprises will encourage the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

    According to the state's spirit of encouraging savings, appropriate preferential treatment is given to savings in terms of interest rates. During the period when prices were not yet stable, the state bank launched value-linked savings. After prices became stable, it launched principal-protected and value-preserved savings. After the fundamental improvement of the financial and economic situation, it promoted currency savings. The current fixed-term savings interest rate after this adjustment is still higher than the interest rate on loans to state-owned industry and commerce and the interest rate on loans to agricultural production cooperatives. The interest rate on overseas Chinese remittances is even more preferential, showing that the state has consistently paid attention to encouraging savings from a material perspective. The First Five-Year Plan requires that "among the people of the whole country, we should promote a simple style, cherish public property, and enthusiastically save and subscribe to government bonds." Because savings are a way for the people to support the country's socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization with funds, the people will enthusiastically participate in savings with a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm.

    The gradual decline in interest rates in our country is conducive to socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and it is also conducive to the accumulation of funds for socialist construction. The accumulation of funds for socialist construction relies on continuously improving labor productivity and continuously reducing the cost of products and circulation costs. The decline in interest rates is a powerful factor influencing the reduction of product costs and circulation costs. The decline in interest rates is carried out on the basis of expanding production and commodity circulation, rapidly increasing bank deposits and loans, relatively reducing the bank expense ratio, and increasing currency stability.

    The reason why interest rates in our country can decline rapidly is that the nature and role of interest rates have undergone fundamental changes. In old China, interest rates were the price of loan capital, a portion of profit, and were affected by the profit rate and the supply and demand of loan capital in the market. The funds concentrated by the new China bank are no longer loan capital, but state budget funds, intermittent funds of socialist enterprises, and people's savings (the proportion of deposits from capitalist industry and commerce is relatively small). The state bank is not an intermediary for buying and selling loan capital, but one of the state's agencies for planned allocation of funds. Capitalist industry and commerce and finance have been gradually subjected to socialist transformation, the independent self-regulating financial market no longer exists, and the laws of interest rate movement in capitalist society have almost completely disappeared. Stalin once pointed out: "It is necessary to prevent excessive domestic accumulation from being dispersed, but to gather it in our cooperative and state credit institutions, and to hold domestic government bonds, so that they are first used for the needs of industry. Naturally, depositors should receive a certain interest for this." ("On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Policy of the Party") The role of interest is to encourage enterprises to deposit intermittent funds in the bank as soon as possible and to urge enterprises to use bank loans sparingly. For people's savings, interest is a material reward. Stipulating the difference between deposit and loan interest is used as the expense of state banks and credit cooperatives, urging them to develop their business and save expenses. The bank has been freed from the control of the bourgeoisie, and interest is no longer in the nature of sharing profits. This is the fundamental reason why interest can be lowered.

    Therefore, on the realistic and concrete economic issue of interest rates, we can also see the great role of our country's people's democratic revolution and socialist revolution and the superiority of our country's people's democratic system. It is precisely the victory of the people's democratic revolution and the progress of the socialist revolution that have lifted the usury burden on the Chinese people (especially farmers and handicraftsmen) and removed a constraint on the development of industrial and agricultural production. It is precisely the superiority of our country's people's democratic system that enables interest rates to gradually decline, becoming a force supporting our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation.

    关于我国的利率问题
    杨培新
    利率的性质和作用，自中华人民共和国成立以来，起了根本的变化。旧中国的利率，是中国四大家族、军阀、官僚、地主罗掘资金、进行内战、积累财富、盘剥人民的一种高利贷。新中国的利率，是中国人民用来集中资金，支持国家的社会主义工业化和对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，巩固企业经济核算制，加速资金积累的一种重要的经济武器。
    旧中国的利率一直保持很高的水准。抗日战争以前，城市银行放款利率平均每年利息百分之十至百分之十六（即向银行借款一百元，每年付利息十元至十六元），远远高出于一般资本主义国家。旧中国的农村，盛行着更加骇人听闻的高利贷。
  “钱三分”、“谷五分”，是最普通的利息，高的有所谓“大加一”、“集集翻”、“驴打滚”等。例如福建闽侯四区青圃村地主放高利贷，在农民青黄不接时放出、稻子收割时收回，每一百斤要取八十斤的利息。山东潍县柴家庄地主放麦子，麦前一斗麦后还一斗半至二斗。江苏川沙县横沙岛地主放债利息为百分之一百到一百二十。
    旧中国利率为什么长时期保持较高的水准呢？这是由于国民党反动政府是旧中国银行放款的主要对象，它以政治借款和发行公债的方式，以很高的利息借用银行的资金来支持内战。当时政治放款的年息高达百分之二十、三十。公债的名义利息为年息百分之六至百分之八，但由于公债以五折、六折收款（只要收到五十元、六十元的现款，就付给一百元的公债票）等于每五十元、六十元就取得利息六元至八元。其中中签还本的，出六十元就可得本金一百元。总算起来，公债实际利息为百分之三十至四十。这样，就带动了社会利率的全盘高涨。按照马克思主义政治经济学关于利率的原理，利息是利润的一部分，利息率决定于利润率，并依借贷资本供求的情况而进行自发的调节。在旧中国，由于银行放款的主要对象不是资本主义工商业而是中国四大家族，因此决定利息率的不是资本主义工商业的利润率，而是远远高出于此的中国四大家族在内战中获得的巨额利润率。中国四大家族不断地进行内战，便不断地罗掘资金，因此形成长时期借贷资本求过于供的现象，这也促成了利率的高昂。
    这种利率高昂的现象对谁有利呢？主要还是对中国四大家族、军阀、官僚、地主有利。由于银行放款利率这样高，一般资本主义工商业是借不起这种贷款的，因此银行资金只能被四大家族所运用作为他们发动内战、抢夺地盘、追求巨额利润的资本。同时使旧中国的金融资本长时期沉于公债投机和政治放款中，造成了对于中国四大家族的依赖。存款利息高，获利的是谁呢？战前银行存款最多的并不是工商业，而是所谓私人和私人团体。所谓私人，主要是中国官僚资产阶级、军阀、官僚、地主。他们把剥削所得存入银行，每次动辄几十万元、几百万元。从农村逃亡到城市的地主，也把他们历代剥削农民所积累的财富存入银行。所谓私人团体存款，主要还是军阀官僚的公款。他们在国外银行存款只能拿到年息百分之二的利息，在国内存款却可以拿到每年百分之七点五左右的利息。旧中国的金融资本实际上起了集中官僚资产阶级、军阀、官僚、地主的“私蓄”和“公款”，以支持四大家族发动国内战争，以追求巨额利润，然后又以四大家族的余沥来从事分配的作用。
    这种利率高昂现象对谁不利？对国民经济的发展不利，对生产力发展不利，对广大人民不利。城市利率高昂，对民族资本的工商业起了窒息的作用。设在中国的日本纱厂自日本银行借取资金，每年只付百分之六、七的利息，中国纱厂向银行借款则需付出百分之十以上的利息，在竞争中居于不利的地位。华商纱厂联合会一九二七年宣言中说：“国内金融，贷款息重，厂商辛苦经营，谋偿银行钱庄欠款之子金，犹虞不足，日积月累，母子相乘，只有出于售厂之一法。”城市利率高昂更助长农村高利贷发展。农民不仅受重视的剥削，而且受重息的剥削，高利贷利息达百分之三十、五十、八十、一百甚至一百二十，这是农业生产所负担不起的，其结果必然是促使农民破产。一个农民一旦借上债，利长利，利加利，不到三、四年，他的房屋、土地，就被地主掠夺去了。城市的高利贷（印子钱等）和典当业，同样是对城市贫民的残酷剥削。因此利率高，对于人民群众是不利的。
    抗日战争开始后，旧中国利率更呈现畸形的高涨。一九四八年国民党反动政府发行金圆券以后不久，利息每月已达百分之一百二十，最高时达百分之六百。这是国民党反动统治的军事、政治、经济、货币危机极其严重、濒于总崩溃的表现。而国民党反动政府自一九四二年起，即一贯有意识地诱导市场利率上涨，对民族资产阶级所经营的企业，采取高利率政策，并促使民族资产阶级破产以利于中国官僚资本主义的扩张。
    旧中国利率高昂，是中国官僚资产阶级和军阀、官僚、地主掌握了工厂、矿山、土地，而且掌握了财政和银行，使之为他们的利益服务的结果。在利率问题上，同样暴露了中国官僚资本主义、封建主义的统治同中国人民利益的根本对立，中国人民必须推翻中国官僚资本主义和封建主义的统治，取消他们的生产资料所有制，才能顺利地解决这个问题，消灭窒息生产的高利贷。
    中华人民共和国成立以来，利率开始逐步下降。由于我们没收了官僚资本的工厂、矿山、银行机构，没收了地主的土地，制止了物价上涨，就消除了旧中国城乡高利贷存在的社会经济基础。和这同时，在人民国家领导下成立了国家银行，发展了信用合作社、管理了资本主义金融业，全国的金融物价实现了前所未有的稳定，使国家有步骤地领导利率下降成为可能。我国的利率，根据党在过渡时期的总路线，采取了逐步下降、分别对待的原则。必须逐步下降利率，才能促使工业、农业、手工业生产和商品流转的发展，实现国家的社会主义工业化和农业的合作化。必须分别对待，才能正确地体现出国家对不同经济成分的企业、对不同阶级的政策。对社会主义企业，放款的利率应当定得低些，而且要鼓励其中认真推行经济核算制的单位（如举办利率较低的结算放款），督促经营不善的单位（如逾期贷款加息百分之十）。对于农民、手工业者放款，应规定较低的利息，以贯彻工农联盟政策，和鼓励农业和手工业生产的发展。规定对农业生产合作社和互助组贷款利息低于个体农民，设备性贷款利息低于一般生产贷款，以鼓励农业、手工业的社会主义改造和逐步采用新的设备，为扶持贫农，规定极贫困户贷款利息低些。为支持贫农积极参加农业生产合作社，规定了利息很低的贫农合作基金贷款。努力引导资本主义金融业一致逐步下降放款利率，以鼓励工商业的正当经营。对公私合营企业放款利率应低于私营企业放款利率，以鼓励资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。对于储蓄规定稍高的利息，作为国家对于人民储蓄的一种物质鼓励。
    国家银行一贯领导利率的下降。北京天津在解放之初，市场利息是较高的，放款利息达月息百分之六十九，人民银行就规定了很低的对国营企业存放款利率和比较低的对资本主义工商业放款利率，影响市场利率的下降。一九五○年三月全国统一财政经济工作、制止物价上涨后，人民银行领导并督促资本主义金融业迅速地坚决地下降利率，以巩固物价的稳定。一九五二年六月在全国“三反”“五反”运动胜利的基础上，再度降低利率，以配合活跃市场。在党提出了过渡时期总路线以后，一九五三年十月着重降低对社会主义企业的放款利率。在第一个五年计划公布以后，一九五五年十月国家银行全面地降低了放款、存款、储蓄利率，以继续支持国家的社会主义工业化，努力迎接即将到来的全国农业合作化高潮，厉行节约、巩固企业的经济核算制。
    我国的利率经过六年来的一再下降，已从市场利率月息百分之六十九的水准，降低到目前月息约百分之一以下的水准，彻底扫除了旧中国抗日战争以前时期和通货膨胀时期所遗留下来的高利贷的残余痕迹。
    对社会主义企业的放款和存款利率，开始就订得比较低，六年来又率先下降，这一次更作了进一步的降低。社会主义企业的流动资金的绝大部分是由国家银行贷给的，国家银行发放大量的低利贷款，使社会主义企业在资金供应的数量上和条件上处于优越的地位，就有利于社会主义企业的发展和社会主义经济优势的日益巩固。这一次降低利率，使社会主义企业节约了数以亿计的利息支出，成为降低产品成本、降低商品流转费用、加速资金积累，巩固企业的经济核算制度的有利因素。
    对农村放款的利率，为了支持农民，有效地打击高利贷，发展农业生产，国家银行自抗日战争时期起，即在农村发放低利的农业贷款。这一次国家银行降低农业生产合作社贷款月息为百分之零点六，贫农合作基金贷款月息为百分之零点四，对个体农民生产贷款月息百分之零点九，对农业互助组以及设备性贷款月息百分之零点七五；对困难大的极贫困户和灾区、老区、少数民族地区农户、军属、烈属，放款月息百分之零点七五。信用合作社的利率也有显著降低。国家银行在区、镇拥有将近二万个营业所，信用合作社在农村已发展到十五万个以上，按照今年冬天已经大大下降的利率，明年春天在农村投放数达十余亿元的低利农贷，这是迎接农业合作化高潮的重要步骤。大量的低利的农业生产合作社生产贷款、贫农合作基金贷款、设备贷款，对于农业生产合作社采用新的现代化的农具和技术发展农业生产，将是有力的支持。同时农村高利贷将受到歼灭性的打击，信用合作社将受到贫困农民的衷心拥护，在组织上业务上进一步巩固起来。
    这次对手工业生产合作社、手工业供销生产社和生产小组、个体手工业者、独立小商者的放款利息也有所降低和调整，贯彻了发展手工业生产和对手工业进行社会主义改造的政策。
    对资本主义工商业放款的利率这次也有所降低和调整。这对资本主义工商业进行有益于国计民生的经营是有利的，并有利于物价的稳定、对公私合营企业放款利率较低将鼓励资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。
    对储蓄的利率，根据国家鼓励储蓄的精神，在利率上予以适当的优待。在物价尚未稳定的时期，国家银行举办了折实储蓄，物价趋于稳定以后举办了保本保值储蓄，财政经济状况根本好转后又推行了货币储蓄。这次调整以后的储蓄定期利率，比较对国营工业、商业放款的利率、对农业生产合作社放款利率，仍然是较高的，对于侨汇储蓄的利率更为优待，可见国家一贯注意从物质利益上鼓励储蓄。第一个五年计划要求“在全国人民群众中，应该提倡朴素的风气，爱护公共财产，踊跃储蓄和认购公债。”由于储蓄是人民从资金上支持国家的社会主义工业化和农业合作化的一种方法，人民必将以高度的爱国主义热情，踊跃参加储蓄。
    我国利率的逐步下降，有利于社会主义工业化和农业合作化，而且有利于社会主义建设的资金积累。社会主义建设的资金积累，依靠不断提高劳动生产率和不断降低产品的成本与流通费用，而利率的下降正是影响产品成本和流通费用降低的有力因素。而利率的下降则又是在生产和商品流转扩大，银行存放款迅速增加、银行费用率相对降低、货币日益稳定的基础上进行的。
    我国利率之所以能够迅速下降，是因为利率的性质和作用已经发生根本的变化。旧中国的利率是借贷资本的价格，是利润的一部分，受利润率和市场借贷资本供求的影响。新中国银行集中的资金已经不是借贷资本，而是国家预算资金、社会主义企业间歇资金和人民的储蓄（资本主义工商业的存款在比重上已比较小）。国家银行不是买卖借贷资本的中介人，而是国家有计划地进行资金分配的机关之一。资本主义工商业和金融业已逐步受到社会主义改造，独立的自发调节的金融市场已经不再存在，资本主义社会中利率运动的规律已经几乎完全消失作用。斯大林曾经指出：“必须使国内超额的积累不分散开来，而集合于我们合作社的及国营的信贷机关，并且举行国内公债，以便把它们首先用于工业底需要。自然，存户应当以此得到一定的利息。”（“论苏联经济状况和党的政策”）利息的作用在于鼓励企业将间歇资金尽速存入银行，并督促企业节约使用银行放款。对于人民储蓄，利息是一种物质奖励。规定存放利息之间的差额，是作为国家银行和信用合作社的费用，督促其发展业务、节约费用。银行摆脱了资产阶级的控制，利息不再属于分取利润的性质，这就是利息得以下降的根本原因。
    因此，在利率这样一个现实的具体的经济问题上，我们也可以看出，我国人民民主革命和社会主义革命的伟大作用，和我国人民民主制度的优越性。正是人民民主革命的胜利和社会主义革命的进行，才解除了压在中国人民（特别是农民、手工业者）头上的高利贷，解除了对于工农业生产发展的一种束缚。正是我国人民民主制度的优越性，才使利率得以逐步下降，成为支持我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的一种力量。
