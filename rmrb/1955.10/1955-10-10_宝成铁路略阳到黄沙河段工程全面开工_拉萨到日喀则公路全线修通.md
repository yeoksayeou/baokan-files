    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 8th. Full-scale construction has begun on the section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway from Lueyang in Shaanxi to Huangshahe in Gansu. In this area, along the cliffs of the upper reaches of the Jialing River, tunnel workers have posted slogans everywhere such as "Conquer the mighty mountains, build the road to happiness." The roar of various machines can be heard from the mountaintops; more tents and thatched huts have appeared on the mountainsides and in the valleys, and the number of road construction workers has increased from several thousand at the beginning of this year to tens of thousands. On the newly built highway from Huangshahe to Huixian County in Gansu, vehicles transporting road construction materials are constantly on the move.
    The Lueyang to Huangshahe section is a very difficult project. It requires the construction of tunnels and the building of deep-water bridges over the Jialing River. Because of the high mountains and deep valleys, special stations must also be built along the route. For example, half of the Chanjuesi Station needs to be built inside a tunnel.
    Currently, the rainy season is about to end, and the staff and workers of the Second Engineering Bureau and Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways New Railway Construction Bureau, and the Tunnel Company are working together to ensure the early completion of the entire Baoji-Chengdu Railway line. Workers of the Mechanical Engineering Team of the Second Engineering Bureau have already begun the most difficult task of excavating the tunnel portal at Gaojiayan, which is locally known as "even immortals find it hard to pass."
    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 9th. The 337-kilometer Lhasa-Xigaze Highway has been fully completed. On the evening of October 7th, the first batch of vehicles from Lhasa arrived in Xigaze city.
    Construction of the Lhasa-Xigaze Highway began at the end of May this year. After this highway and the Xigaze-Jiangzi Highway, which completed its roadbed construction on September 10th, are opened to traffic, they will connect the three major cities of Tibet, Lhasa, Xigaze, and Jiangzi, as well as the pastoral areas of northern Tibet and the agricultural areas of the Yarlung Tsangpo River basin, which will play a significant role in promoting material exchange within Tibet.

    宝成铁路略阳到黄沙河段工程全面开工
    拉萨到日喀则公路全线修通
    新华社成都八日电　宝成铁路从陕西略阳到甘肃黄沙河一段的工程已全面开工。在这一地段内，沿着嘉陵江上游的悬崖陡壁上，隧道工人们到处张贴着“征服重重大山，修通幸福之路”等的标语。在山顶上发出了各种机械的隆隆声；在山腰和沟底已出现了更多篷帐和草房，筑路的工人已从今年年初的几千人增加到几万人。在新修的从黄沙河到甘肃徽县的公路上，运送筑路器材的车辆络绎不绝。
    略阳到黄沙河段工程很艰巨。其间要修隧道，要在嘉陵江上架起深水大桥。因为山高谷深，沿线还要修建特别的车站，例如禅觉寺车站就有一半需要修在隧道里。
    目前雨季即将过去，铁道部新建铁路第二工程局、第四工程局、隧道公司等施工单位的职工正在共同为保证宝成铁路全线提前通车而努力。第二工程局机械工程队的工人，已在被当地称为“神仙难过”的高家岩，开始了最困难的开挖隧道洞门的工作。
    新华社拉萨九日电　全长三百三十七公里的拉（萨）日（喀则）公路已经全线修通。十月七日傍晚，从拉萨驶来的第一批汽车就开到了日喀则市区。
    拉（萨）日（喀则）公路是在今年五月底动工修筑的，这条公路和在九月十日已完成了路基工程的日（喀则）江（孜）公路通车以后，就把西藏三大城市拉萨、日喀则、江孜以及藏北牧区和雅鲁藏布江流域农业区连接起来，对开展西藏境内物资交流将起很大的作用。
