    Protest Against the Illegal Actions of the Japanese Government
    Du Bo
    According to a Kyodo News report, the Japanese government will send 150 Chinese residents in Japan, who are being detained in the Hamamatsu "detention center" of the Yokohama Immigration Bureau, to Taiwan on the 16th. The report also states that "most of these people are those who entered Japan illegally and Chinese merchants who resided in Japan during the war." We protest against this illegal act by the Japanese government.
    First of all, the fact that Chinese merchants who resided in Japan during the war are still being detained in the so-called "detention center" in Japan ten years after the end of the war, is a typical manifestation of the Japanese government's discriminatory and even persecutory stance towards overseas Chinese. The Japanese government's illegal handover of these overseas Chinese, whom it has illegally detained on trumped-up charges, and Chinese merchants who resided in Japan during the war to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, is an expression of hostility towards the Chinese people and towards overseas Chinese in Japan.
    Our overseas Chinese residing in Japan have expressed their steadfast willingness to love and support their motherland more than once. The statement issued by the Tokyo Chinese General Association on September 1 this year regarding the situation of overseas Chinese in Japan, supporting the statement made by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on August 16 concerning the issue of overseas Chinese in China and Japan, and exposing the Japanese government's unfair attitude towards our overseas Chinese in Japan, is the best proof of this. The Japanese government has absolutely no right to arbitrarily hand over overseas Chinese in Japan to the Chiang bandit clique.
    Due to the lack of sincerity on the part of the Japanese government, normal diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not yet been restored. However, our government has never allowed the issue of the return of Japanese nationals in China to be hampered because normal relations between China and Japan have not yet been established. Our government has always provided various conveniences to Japanese nationals in China who wish to return to their country. By the end of March 1955, 29,000 of the original 35,000 Japanese nationals in China had returned to Japan. Only more than 6,000 Japanese nationals remain in China, because they have expressed their willingness to reside in China for a long or temporary period.
    Now, the Japanese government is illegally sending a portion of our overseas Chinese in Japan, whom it has illegally detained, to Taiwan to serve as cannon fodder for the Chiang bandit clique's harassment of our coastal areas. This not only infringes upon the legitimate rights and freedoms of overseas Chinese in Japan, but also deprives them of their right to love their motherland and return to their motherland, endangering their safety. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate such arbitrary actions by the Japanese government in handling our overseas Chinese.
    The Japanese government's actions are clearly related to American influence. According to Agence France-Presse, "The US authorities in Tokyo have asked Japan to abide by the US attitude towards Communist China, and pointed out that the new financial assistance recently promised by US Undersecretary of State Hoover will be determined by such an attitude." If this is true, then it has nothing in common with its repeated claims of "improving Sino-Japanese relations."
    If the Japanese government still remembers its claim to "improve Sino-Japanese relations," it should immediately change its improper attitude in dealing with the issue of our overseas Chinese in Japan, immediately stop handing over our overseas Chinese to the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and send those overseas Chinese in Japan who are willing to return to their motherland back to the People's Republic of China.

    抗议日本政府的非法行为
    杜波
    据共同社消息，日本政府将于十六日把被拘留在横滨入境管理局滨松“收容所”里的中国旅日侨民一百五十人送到台湾去。这个消息还说，“这些人大部分都是非法进入日本的人和战时在日本居住的华商。”我们抗议日本政府这种非法行为。
    首先，战时在日本居住的华商在战争结束已经十年的今天，还被拘留在日本的所谓“收容所”里面，这典型地表现了日本政府歧视甚至迫害华侨的立场。日本政府把它以莫须有的罪名而非法拘留的华侨和战时居住日本的华商非法解交蒋介石卖国集团，更是敌视中国人民、敌视旅日华侨的表现。
    旅居日本的我国侨民，曾不止一次表示了他们热爱和拥护祖国的坚贞意愿。东京华侨总会在今年九月一日就在日华侨的处境所发表的声明，拥护中华人民共和国外交部发言人八月十六日有关中日两国侨民问题的声明，并揭露了日本政府对待我国旅日侨民的不公正态度，就是一个最好的证明。日本政府绝无权利把旅日华侨任意解交蒋贼集团。
    由于日本政府缺乏诚意，中日两国至今还没有恢复正常的外交关系。但是，我国政府从未因为中日正常关系尚未建立，而使在华日侨的回国问题发生困难。我国政府对愿意回国的在华日侨，一向给予各种方便。到一九五五年三月底为止，在中国的原有三万五千名日本侨民，已有二万九千名愿意回国的日侨返回日本。现在只有六千多名日侨还留在中国，这是因为他们表示愿意长期或暂时侨居中国。
    现在，日本政府却把它非法拘留的我国一部分旅日侨民非法送到台湾去，作为蒋贼集团骚扰我国沿海的炮灰。这不仅侵犯在日华侨的正当权益和自由，并且剥夺了华侨爱护自己祖国和返回祖国的权利，危害了他们的安全。日本政府这种任意处理我国侨民的非法行动，是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    日本政府的这种行动，显然是和美国的影响有关的。据法新社报道：“驻东京的美国当局已要求日本遵从美国对共产党中国的态度，并且指出美国副国务卿胡佛最近所允诺的新的财政援助要看这样一种态度来决定。”如果真是这样，那末，这同它屡次所作的“改善中日关系”的说法，是毫无相同之处的。
    日本政府如果还记得它宣称要“改善中日关系”的话，它就应该立即改变它在处理我国旅日侨民问题上的不正当的态度，立即停止将我国侨民解交蒋介石集团，把愿意返回祖国的旅日华侨送回中华人民共和国。
