Once a Mountain Was Blasted Flat
    Lin Yin

On September 27th, workers constructing the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, under the guidance of Soviet experts, conducted an unprecedented large-scale blasting operation on Qingshiya Mountain, about thirty kilometers from Baoji. The power of this blasting was extremely strong, blasting away the summit of Qingshiya Mountain in one go. The blasted rock and soil amounted to more than 230,000 cubic meters, which would require at least 15,000 train cars to transport. The amount of explosives used was 341 tons. Such a large-scale blasting operation is a first in China's engineering history.

Qingshiya Mountain is a peak in the Qinling Mountains, rising more than 1,000 meters above sea level. In front of the mountain is a valley more than ten zhang deep. According to the original design of the railway department, a portion of the Qingshiya Station on the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway had to be located inside the Qingshiya tunnel, and a high bridge capable of accommodating two trains running side-by-side had to be built over the valley in front of the mountain. This project would require excavating and filling 850,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, and was planned to be completed within eighteen months. This spring, Soviet experts inspected the terrain at Qingshiya and suggested using large-scale blasting to blow away the entire mountaintop, while using the blasted rock and soil to fill the valley. This would eliminate the need for tunnel excavation and bridge construction, and would also allow this section of the railway project to be completed four months ahead of schedule.

On the day of the blasting, it was raining lightly. The Qinling Mountains were shrouded in dark clouds. At noon, the blasting command post issued an order, and immediately a huge explosion was heard. From a distance, thick smoke was seen rising straight into the sky from the summit of Qingshiya Mountain, and the dark clouds covering the mountain instantly changed color. At this time, the shattered rocks of all sizes flew out like fireworks set off in front of Tiananmen Square, and large rocks weighing four or five tons were blasted more than 100 meters away. The flying rocks and soil, according to the original design, had sixty percent of it landing in the valley that needed to be filled; the soil and rocks that collapsed from the mountain also surged towards the valley like a tide; and some of the rocks were blasted into fine powder. Five minutes after the explosion, the air within a few miles was filled with fine sand flying like dense rain, and the nearby highway was covered with a centimeter-thick layer of yellow sand within minutes.

Because the power and range of the blasting had been precisely calculated before the blasting, and the preparation work was done very carefully, no people or livestock were injured. Two hours after the blasting, all of the more than 40,000 workers, family members, and local residents who had been evacuated to several miles away safely returned home one after another. Traffic on the highway in this area was also restored within a few hours.

An hour and a half after the blasting, the thick smoke gradually dissipated, and the audience came to the foot of the original Qingshiya Mountain to watch: the Qingshiya peak, which originally seemed to be at least fifteen stories high, had been leveled, and the deep valley in front of the mountain had also been roughly filled, forming a flat area large enough to lay two railway tracks and build a small railway station. All of this precisely realized the original design plan that had been precisely calculated.

Although large-scale blasting has long been used in the Soviet Union to benefit mankind, such as for digging river channels, building huge water conservancy projects, and railways and highways with more difficult engineering, the amount of explosives used in past blasting projects in our country has been very small. This time, some people, hearing that hundreds of tons of explosives would be used at once, felt both novel and afraid; some people did not believe that a mountain could be blasted flat with one shot; and some people were afraid that the geology would change after the blasting, and that the soil on the mountain would often collapse in the future. Therefore, the successful experience of this blasting on the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is very significant. It proves that large-scale blasting is an advanced construction method that can ensure safe production and high efficiency. Most of the new railways in our country's first Five-Year Plan are in the southwest and northwest plateau areas, with particularly many tunnels and earth-filling projects. If large-scale blasting is widely promoted, it will speed up the construction of new railways.

    一次炸平一座山
    林印
    九月二十七日那天，修建宝成铁路北段的职工在苏联专家指导下，在距离宝鸡大约三十多公里的青石崖山上，进行了一次空前的大爆破。这一次爆破的威力非常强大，一炮就把青石崖山顶炸飞了，炸开的山石和沙土有二十三万多立方公尺，若用火车来装运，至少需要一万五千个车皮。这次所用的炸药有三百四十一吨。这样大规模的爆破在我国工程史上还是第一次。
    青石崖是秦岭山脉的一个山峰，拔海一千多公尺，山前是一个十几丈深的山谷。按照铁路部门原来的设计，宝成路北段的青石崖车站的一部分必需设在青石崖的隧道里，山前峡谷上还要架起一座能够容纳两列火车并行的高桥。这个工程，要挖填八十五万立方公尺的土和石，计划在十八个月内完成。今年春天，苏联专家到青石崖看了地势，建议采用大量爆破法把整个山顶炸掉，同时利用扬弃的山石和沙土来填满山谷，这样可以省去开挖隧道和架桥工程，还可以使这一段的铁路工程提前四个月完工。
    爆破的那天，正下着小雨。秦岭上阴云密布。正午时分，爆破指挥所命令一下，立刻听见一声巨大的爆炸声，远远地只见浓烟从青石崖山顶直冲云霄，笼罩在山上的阴云顿时变了颜色。这时，被炸裂的大大小小的石块像是天安门前所放的礼花一样迸飞、四五吨重的大石块也被炸飞到一百公尺以外。飞扬的石块和沙土按照原来设计，有百分之六十飞到了需要填土的峡谷里；山上坍塌下来的沙土和石块也像潮水一样涌向峡谷；还有一部分石头被炸成了细粉。爆炸五分钟后，方圆几里之内，空中充满着像密雨一样飞扬的细沙，附近的公路上几分钟之内就盖上了一公寸厚的黄沙。
    由于在爆破之前精密地计算过爆破的力量和破坏的范围，准备工作做得很周到，没有任何人和牲畜受伤害。爆破两小时后，疏散到几里地以外的四万多工人、家属和当地的居民全部安全地陆续回了家。这一带的公路也在几小时之内恢复了交通。
    爆破一小时半后，浓烟逐渐消失，观众来到原来的青石崖山前观看：原先看来至少有十五层楼那末高的青石崖山峰已被削平，山前的深谷也大致被填起来，形成了一块足可铺设两股铁路路轨和修建一个小火车站的平坦地区。这一切都恰好实现了原来经过精确计算的设计计划。
    大量爆破在苏联虽然早已用来为人类造福，如开凿河道、修建巨大的水利工程和工程比较艰巨的铁路公路等。但是在我国，过去的爆破工程所用的炸药都非常少。这回有人听说一次要用几百吨炸药，感到又新鲜又害怕；有的人不相信一炮就能炸平一座山头；也有人恐怕爆破以后地质会起变化，将来山上的土经常要坍塌下来。因此宝成路北段这一次爆破的成功经验是很有意义的。它证明了大量爆破法是能保证安全生产和效率很高的一项先进施工方法。我国第一个五年计划中的新建铁路多半在西南和西北高原地带，隧道和填土工程特别多，如果普遍推广大量爆破法，将会加快新铁路的建设速度。
