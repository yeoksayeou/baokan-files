On the afternoon of the 22nd, the Burmese National Football Team played a friendly match with the Wuhan City Football Team. After the game started, the two sides engaged in a back-and-forth battle for a long time. At thirty-six minutes, the Burmese team's left inside forward shot from eighteen meters away from the Wuhan team's goal. The ball hit the goal post and bounced back, and center forward G. Samuel caught up and shot into the net from the right. At this time, more than 30,000 spectators in the audience immediately applauded enthusiastically. By the end of the first half, the Burmese team led by one to zero.

In the second half, the Wuhan team launched a counterattack. In less than five minutes, the Wuhan team's right wing got the ball and took the opportunity to cut in from the right. They gently flicked the ball in front of the goal. The opponent's goalkeeper was caught off guard and the ball went into the net. The score on the field was one to one. Afterwards, the Wuhan team had several more shooting opportunities, but the ball was saved by the Burmese team's goalkeeper La Mao. After the Burmese team got the ball, they immediately launched a counterattack. At twenty-seven minutes, the Burmese team's center forward dribbled the ball into the Wuhan team's penalty area. The Wuhan team's goalkeeper was eager to save the ball and left his position to pounce, but the opponent took advantage of the situation and kicked the ball in. The Burmese team took the lead again. In less than a minute, the Wuhan team attacked the opponent's penalty area again. The Burmese team's left forward intercepted the ball and turned around at eleven meters to pass the ball to goalkeeper La Mao, but La Mao had already left the goal and failed to catch the ball. The ball gently rolled into the net, and the record became two to two. After the kickoff from the center line, the Burmese team's forward got the ball and shot from eighteen meters away. The ball touched the goal post and bounced into the net from the upper right corner. The record became three to two. Afterwards, the two sides competed even more fiercely, but neither scored.

    缅甸国家足球队同武汉市足球队作友谊赛
    缅甸国家足球队以三比二获胜
    据新华社讯　应邀来我国访问的缅甸国家足球代表团二十一日来武汉访问比赛后，已在二十三日上午离武汉去广州。
    二十二日下午，缅甸国家足球队同武汉市足球队举行了一场友谊比赛。比赛开始后，双方长时间形成拉锯战。到三十六分钟时，缅甸队左内锋在距武汉队球门十八公尺处射门，球撞门柱弹回，被中锋格·塞缪尔赶上从右面射入网内。这时全场三万多观众立刻热烈地鼓掌。到上半场终了时，缅甸队以一比零领先。
    下半场武汉队展开反攻。不到五分钟，武汉队右翼得球乘机从右方切入，在门前轻轻一拨，对方守门员防备不及，球窜入网，场上比分一比一。以后，武汉队又获得几次射门机会，但球都被缅甸队守门员拉貌扑住。缅甸队得球后，也立刻转入反攻。二十七分钟时，缅甸队中锋带球进入武汉队禁区，武汉队守门员救球心切，离位扑球，却被对方乘虚而入，一脚踢中。缅甸队再度领先。过了不到一分钟，武汉队又攻入对方禁区，缅甸队左前卫截住来球，在十一公尺处转身将球传给守门员拉貌，但拉貌已离开大门，接球不及，球轻轻滚入网内，记录变成二比二。中线开球后，缅甸队前锋在十八公尺处得球射门，球触门柱，从右上角弹入网内，记录变成三比二。以后，双方争夺更为剧烈，但都没有得分。最后，缅甸队以三比二获胜。球赛结束后，全场观众再一次以热烈的掌声来感谢缅甸队和武汉队的精采表演。
    缅甸国家足球代表团在武汉期间，还参观了汉水铁桥和汉水公路桥工程、武汉长江大桥工程，观看了楚剧。部分团员还访问了市郊群力农业生产合作社。
