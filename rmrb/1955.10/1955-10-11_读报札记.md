    Reading the Newspaper
    Pan Fei
    A series of events that occurred inside and outside the Tenth United Nations General Assembly, before and after its opening, have sparked extensive commentary in American newspapers.

    An article written by Joseph Rashi in the "New York Post" on September 25th argued that the United States "didn't do very well" in the first week of the General Assembly. He wrote:

    On two decisive occasions, it is believed that the attitude taken by the Soviet Union will ultimately prove more attractive to the rest of the world than that of the United States.

    On the issue of disarmament, Russia has cleverly placed itself in a position where it appears to be leading the way in ending the arms race, while the United States continues to place almost all of its weight on the President's proposal for an exchange of blueprints and aerial inspections.

    In fact, after Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech on Friday (i.e., September 23rd), the Soviet Union could demand sympathetic consideration of everyone's plans—American, British, French, and Russian.

    On the other hand, the United States is still focusing on the President's plan, saying that it should be implemented first "between the Soviet Union and the United States."

    This approach is difficult even for our allies, who are actually asking, "Where do we fit in?"

    The second occasion—where many believe Dulles was defeated by Molotov—is the approach to underdeveloped countries.

    In his speech, Molotov said many good things about the Bandung Conference, the people of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, and their struggle for independence. ... Dulles's speech contained almost nothing of this kind.

    More importantly, the United States voted against, while the Soviet Union voted in favor of, including the Cyprus and Algeria issues on the agenda of the General Assembly.

    Admitting that the United States "didn't do very well" in the United Nations is a good cooling-off remedy for some Americans who always want to reign supreme and adopt an attitude of "summoning when needed" and "dismissing when not." However, Rashi apparently did not provide the correct answer as to why the Soviet Union's attitude is "more attractive" than that of the United States. The Soviet Union demobilized troops withdrawn from Austria; the United States sent troops withdrawn from Austria into Italy. According to Western newspapers, the United States refused to include the Cyprus issue on the UN agenda in exchange for British support to exclude the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations; while the Soviet Union has consistently supported national independence and national self-determination in the United Nations. It is difficult to find a market today to insist on calling these actions of the Soviet Union "tactics" or "means."

    Another article in the same day's "New York Post"—Childs's "Contrasts in the United Nations"—offers a more objective answer to this question. Childs said: "... The United States has allowed two months to pass since the Geneva Conference without any new diplomatic initiatives... The contrast between Moscow and Washington is striking." "The usual atmosphere of the Tenth Session of the United Nations is particularly evident in the meetings held by the three major powers to prepare for bravely resisting the naughty children in the school. This certainly does not have the face after the Geneva Conference. This is the familiar pattern of the past..." and the consequence will be the isolation of the United States in the world.

    In fact, more American newspapers have foreseen that the United States will face "the most serious and urgent crisis." The "Washington Post" of October 1st published an article by Drew Pearson, entitled "Critical Issues Will Approach a Climax," which mentioned the relationship between the United States and West Germany after the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany established diplomatic relations. He said: "The United States has always regarded West Germany as the backbone of resistance to Russia... Today this view has been shaken." Pearson also mentioned that the United States' refusal to support Greece on the Cyprus issue has "triggered a huge anti-American wave" in Greece.

    Of course, the crisis facing the United States is by no means limited to the relationship between the United States and West Germany or Greece. It has touched the foundation of American foreign policy.

    When Dulles addressed the UN General Assembly on September 22nd, he boasted that the "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty" was an "unparalleled" "security arrangement." The next day, the "Washington Post" published a commentary whose estimate was much clearer than that of the US Secretary of State. The "Washington Post" wrote:

    There is no benefit to exaggerating the importance of the Southeast Asia Treaty. As Dulles hopes, it is conceivable that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization may one day "powerfully deter aggression"; but so far, this treaty is almost a blank piece of paper. It is reasonable to think that the Bandung Conference has had more influence in stabilizing the situation in the Far East than the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    As for the North Atlantic Group, American newspapers admit that the Soviet Union's peace policy has brought "serious new problems to the Western powers in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." The "New York Times" of September 25th put it more specifically: there are many people in Western Europe, "they are not Communists, but they do not believe that Soviet leaders want war." "Due to McCarthyism and the warlike remarks of naval and army generals, the prestige of the United States in Europe has been greatly reduced." The newspaper continued:

    One tenet of the "Cold War" is that successful negotiations with the Soviet Union are only possible from a position of strength. In the West, this strength has been painstakingly built since 1950. Considering that military spending puts economic pressure on the economies of some important members of the Western alliance, and considering that the confidence of the European people in Moscow's peaceful intentions is growing, it remains questionable how long the Western military strength can be maintained.

    Based on the above, what conclusions should be drawn? American newspapers generally believe that the old policies are no longer viable; a new way out must be found. Childs wrote in the "New York Post" on September 25th:

    ... They (referring to the representatives of Western countries in the UN General Assembly) are likely to ask whether the United States has also estimated that it is necessary to adopt a new strategy to comply with the "Geneva Spirit," although the term "Geneva Spirit" has now become a cliché, it does summarize the widespread expectations generated by the grand speeches on peace in Geneva.

    There is little sign that the United States has recognized the need to adopt a new attitude. Representatives, observers, and newspaper reporters almost without exception talked about the mistake of the State Department's declaration that Chancellor Adenauer's visit to Moscow was a "victory" for the West. Although this unfortunate boast occurred when Secretary of State Dulles and his chief civil advisor were not in Washington, it still seems to express the determination to fight the old war with the same old words. And the old words are not working.

    This passage from the "New York Post" shows its confusion about the world situation and its complaints about the US State Department. But it is worth noting its framing of the question. The "New York Post's" starting point is not how to promote and realize the "Geneva Spirit," but to conduct the "old war" with "new words." This article repeatedly emphasizes that "a change in attitude is extremely important at present," but finally says that the "peace" it demands is "a peace that is only possible when the Communists are willing to accept the reality of the Western attitude."

    This shows that the views of the "New York Post" and other American newspapers are still far from the views of those who are working to ease the situation. If the "Geneva Spirit" only means putting on a few smiles in front of the photographer's lens, this "spirit" can be blown away overnight. The "Geneva Spirit" was born out of the people's desire for peace, a "great pressure" that President Eisenhower said was "felt equally by everyone."

    If so, then what needs to be changed is not the attitude and strategy, but the foreign policy of the United States.

    读报札记 
    潘非
    十届联大开幕前后在会内会外所发生的一系列的事件，引起了美国报纸的广泛评论。
    九月二十五日“纽约邮报”上约瑟夫·拉希所写的一篇文章，认为美国在联大的第一个星期中“搞得不太好”。他写道：
    在两个有决定性意义的场合，人们认为苏联所采取的态度最后一定会证明，比美国的态度对世界其他部分更富吸引力。
    在裁军问题上，俄国用机谋使自己处于这样的地位：看来它是带头结束军备竞赛的，而美国则继续把几乎全部的重力放在总统的关于交换蓝图和空中视察的建议上。
    事实上，苏联外交部长莫洛托夫星期五（即九月二十三日）发表演说以后，苏联就能要求对每个人的计划——美国、英国、法国和俄国的计划——加以同情的考虑。
    另一方面，美国还是集中在总统的计划上，它说，这个计划是应该“在苏联和美国之间”首先实施的计划。
    这个办法甚至很难中我们的盟国的意，我们的盟国实际上也一直在问：“我们安排在什么地方呢？”
    第二个场合——许多人认为杜勒斯在这里已被莫洛托夫打败——就是对落后国家的手段。
    莫洛托夫在演说中，对万隆会议、亚洲、非洲和中东各国人民以及他们争取独立的斗争，说了许多好话。……杜勒斯的演说中则几乎毫无这类东西。
    更重要的是美国投票反对，而苏联投票赞成把塞浦路斯和阿尔及利亚问题列入大会议程。
    承认美国在联合国“搞得不太好”，对于某些总想君临一切之上、对联合国采取“呼之则来”“挥之即去”态度的美国人来说，是一服很好的清凉剂。但是，关于为什么苏联的态度比美国的“更富吸引力”，拉希显然没有作出正确的答案。苏联把从奥地利撤退出来的军队复员了；美国却把从奥地利抽出来的军队送进意大利。据西方国家报纸揭露，美国拒绝把塞浦路斯问题列入联大议程，是换取英国支持它排斥中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利；而苏联在联合国中则一贯地支持民族独立和民族自决的要求。把苏联的这些行动硬说成是“机谋”，是“手段”，在今天是很难找到市场的。
    同日“纽约邮报”的另一篇文章——蔡尔兹写的“在联合国的对照”——对于这个问题有比较客观的解答。蔡尔兹说：“……美国自从日内瓦会议以来，让时间过了两个月而没有任何新的外交行动……。莫斯科和华盛顿之间的对比是显著的。”“联合国第十届会议的一如往常的空气，特别见于三大国为准备勇敢地抵抗学校里的顽童而举行的会议中。这当然并不具有日内瓦会议后的面貌。这是过去熟悉的式样……”，而其后果，将是美国在世界的孤立。
    事实上，更多的美国报纸已经预感到美国将面临“最严重和最迫切的危机”。十月一日的“华盛顿邮报”刊载了德鲁·皮尔逊的一篇文章，题为“紧要的问题将接近最高潮”，其中提到苏联和德意志联邦共和国建立外交关系后美国和西德的关系。他说：“美国以前一直把西德当作抵抗俄国……的骨干。今天这种见解已动摇了。”皮尔逊还提到美国拒绝在塞浦路斯问题上支持希腊，已在希腊“引起了一股巨大的反美浪潮”。
    当然，美国所面临的危机，决不是仅仅在美国和西德或希腊的关系上。它已触及到美国对外政策的基础。
    九月二十二日杜勒斯在联大演说时，把“东南亚防御条约”夸为“举世无双”的“安全安排”。第二天，“华盛顿邮报”发表了一篇评论，它的估计远比美国国务卿的看法清醒得多。“华盛顿邮报”写道：
    夸大东南亚条约的重要性是不会得到任何好处的。正如杜勒斯所希望的，可以想像，东南亚条约组织有一天可能“很有力地遏止侵略”；但是迄今为止，这个条约差不多还是一张白纸。这样想是合理的：万隆会议在稳定远东局势方面比东南亚条约组织有更多的影响。
    至于北大西洋集团，美国报纸承认：苏联的和平政策已给“北大西洋公约组织中的西方实力带来了严重的新问题”。九月二十五日的“纽约时报”说得更具体：在西欧有许多人，“他们不是共产党人，但是他们不相信苏联领袖希望战争。”“由于麦卡锡主义和陆海军将领的好战言论，美国在欧洲的威信已经大大降低”。这个报纸接着写道：
    “冷战”中的一条信条就是只有从实力地位出发，才有可能同苏联进行顺利的谈判。在西方，从一九五○年以来，就在辛勤地建立这种实力。考虑到军事开支使西方联盟中某些重要成员国的经济受到经济上的压力，考虑到欧洲各国人民对于莫斯科的和平意图的信心日益增长，西方的军事实力地位能够维持多久尚属疑问。
    根据上述情况，应该得出什么结论呢？美国报纸普遍认为，旧的政策已经走不通了；必须找到一条新的出路。九月二十五日“纽约邮报”上蔡尔兹的文章说：
    ……他们（指联合国大会中的西方国家代表）很可能要问，美国是否也已经估计到有必要采取一个新的战略来符合“日内瓦精神”，尽管现在“日内瓦精神”一词已经沦为陈词滥调，然而它确是总结了由于在日内瓦就和平发表的堂皇演说所产生的广泛期望。
    很少有迹象证明，美国已经认识到有采取一种新态度的必要。代表们，观察家们和报纸记者们，几乎是没有例外地谈论着国务院宣布阿登纳总理访问莫斯科是西方的“胜利”一举的错误。虽然这个不幸的吹嘘发生在国务卿杜勒斯和他的主要公务顾问不在华盛顿的时候，它仍然似乎是表现了以同样的旧言词来打旧的战争的决心。而旧的言词是不行了。
    “纽约邮报”的这一段话，表现了它对世界局势的困惑，对美国国务院的抱怨。但值得注意的是它对问题的提法。“纽约邮报”的出发点，不是如何来推动和实现“日内瓦精神”，而是要用“新的言词”来进行“旧的战争”。这篇文章一再强调“态度的改变在目前是极为重要的”，但最后说，它所要求的“和平”，是“只有共产党愿意接受西方态度的现实时才有可能实现的和平”。
    这就显示了“纽约邮报”以及美国其他报纸的观点，同努力和缓局势的人们的观点还有很大的距离。“日内瓦精神”如果只是意味着在摄影记者的镜头前面装几次微笑，这种“精神”是可以在一夜之间被吹散的。“日内瓦精神”的产生，是由于各国人民对和平的渴望，是艾森豪威尔总统所说的“每一个人同样感到的”、“一种很大的压力”。
    既然如此，那末要改变的决不是态度和策略，而是美国的对外政策。
