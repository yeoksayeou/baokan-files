Heilongjiang Province farmers are actively using proceeds from wheat sales to repay national agricultural loans. As of September 23, over 1.57 million yuan had been repaid, accounting for 78.8% of the wheat harvest loan recovery plan. In Hulan County, thanks to the Party committee's emphasis on this work and its efforts to educate farmers on actively repaying national loans, the original target for wheat harvest loan recovery was 160,000 yuan, but farmers have now repaid 250,000 yuan. The CPC Keshan County Committee formulated a loan recovery plan as early as August, and it was discussed by the village branches, mobilizing the masses to actively repay loans. As a result, this work has been done well and is still ongoing. (Our correspondent in Harbin)

    黑龙江农民积极偿还农业贷款
    黑龙江省农民正积极用麦收款项偿还国家农业贷款。截至九月二十三日已偿还一百五十七万多元，占麦收贷款回收计划百分之七十八点八。呼兰县由于党委重视这一工作，抓紧了对农民进行积极偿还国家贷款的教育，原定麦收回收贷款十六万元，到现在农民已还二十五万元。中共克山县委早于八月就制定农贷回收方案，并由各村支部讨论，发动群众积极偿还贷款，因此，这一工作做得较好，目前仍在继续进行中。（本报驻哈尔滨记者）
