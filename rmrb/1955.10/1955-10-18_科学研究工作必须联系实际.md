    Scientific Research Must Connect with Reality
    Mao Yisheng, Director of the Railway Research Institute, Ministry of Railways
    How scientific research work should connect with reality is a pressing issue that needs to be resolved. Regarding this issue, I would like to discuss the situation at the Railway Research Institute for your reference.
    Railway transportation is a massive enterprise and the primary force for completing national transportation tasks. In our first Five-Year Plan, the state's investment in railway infrastructure exceeds that of any other sector except industry.
    China's railways have a history of over eighty years. However, before liberation, they served imperialist aggression and could not fulfill their due role in the national economy. After liberation, through restoration and expansion, and the promotion of advanced Soviet experiences, it, like other undertakings of the motherland, has taken on a completely new look. China's railway freight turnover will reach over 120 billion ton-kilometers, and passenger traffic will reach over 31.9 billion passenger-kilometers in 1957 alone. Considering the railway length of over 28,000 kilometers that year, such a huge "load" is rare in the world. However, China's railway foundation was originally very weak, with not only backward tools but also extremely chaotic standard specifications. Although improvements have been made in recent years, it is still very difficult to bear such a huge transport volume, and we must vigorously strengthen and transform the existing railway technical equipment to achieve this. In the process of this strengthening and transformation, many technical problems will inevitably be encountered, all of which need to be solved through scientific research. This is the task of our Railway Research Institute.
    The Railway Research Institute was established in March 1950. To date, it has conducted over a hundred research topics and has done a lot of technical work for the Ministry of Railways and the field. Several of these research projects have had a significant impact on the railway field. There are also quite a few relatively successful projects. The purpose of these efforts is to increase railway transport volume or reduce costs. Although the exact figures are difficult to estimate at the moment, because the railway is a large enterprise, the number of production tools required is particularly large, and any small improvement, when accumulated, becomes a huge number. For example, if the research on the preservation of railway sleepers can extend the life of railway sleepers nationwide by one year, it can save the country 100 million yuan in wealth. Another example is a smaller research project, the restoration of the rain-proof capacity of old tarpaulins on freight cars. After being promoted in the field, it can save 3 million yuan per year.
    From its five and a half years of history, these works of the Railway Research Institute are far from enough. This is mainly because we took many detours in the early stages of establishing the institute and paid a great price to explore experience. At the same time, the training of staff has also affected the work. It was not until 1953, when all researchers intensively studied Russian, collected Russian materials, and learned advanced Soviet research methods, that our work gradually got on the right track and improved. At the same time, the connection with the railway field and the relationship with other research institutions and universities have also become increasingly close, thus laying a preliminary foundation. Based on these years of experience, we have the following understandings.
    The Issue of Research Tasks. As the name suggests, railway research work should of course serve railway transportation, that is, on the requirement of improving railway transportation efficiency, it has the main responsibility of solving technical problems. These problems arise because: First, it is necessary to technically transform the "basic production tools" of the railway and establish modern equipment, including the renovation of old equipment, the "standardization" of new equipment, and the formulation of design specifications for new routes; Second, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of using production tools, including extending the life of fixed assets, such as steel rails and sleepers, and saving consumable materials, such as locomotive coal and lubricating oil; Third, it is necessary to widely apply new technologies on the railway and tap existing potential; Fourth, it is necessary to implement the "full load, exceeding the axle by 500 kilometers" movement in railway transportation. Some people believe that in the basic production tools of the railway, almost all materials (such as steel rails, sleepers) and machinery (such as locomotives, vehicles) are produced by other enterprise departments, and there are advanced Soviet experiences as examples in the technology of transportation business, so the research work of the railway itself will not be too much. However, the adoption of materials and machinery requires specifications and standardization, and the study of Soviet experience should be combined with the specific conditions of our country. Even if the same theoretical problem has been solved in the Soviet Union, it cannot be directly applied to our railways due to the different quality of tools and the environment in which they are used. Therefore, the task of railway research work is not only arduous but also comprehensive, including all departments of the railway. Sometimes, due to needs, it also includes the research work of raw materials belonging to other enterprise departments. Here, how railway research work cooperates and coordinates with the research work of other enterprise departments to avoid duplication and omissions is a problem that urgently needs to be adjusted and balanced. This has been clearly stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan.
    The Issue of Research Direction. Since the basic production tools of the railway include almost all kinds of industrial products, a large number of complex technical problems will inevitably be encountered in the selection, organization, and application of these products. To solve these problems, there must be a clear research direction, so as not to deal with the head when the head hurts, engage in trivial matters, or reverse priorities, or lack foresight. We have tried to analyze the essence of railway technical problems, and according to their importance and interrelationship, formulate a set of systems, just like drawing the roots, stems, branches, and leaves of a tree. Then, when encountering a problem, we can give it a position that it should occupy on the tree, so as to see their importance and urgency, and discover upcoming problems. We call this work "technical systematization." In addition, among the various problems of railway technology, we further discover which problems are common and critical. Solving such a problem is equivalent to treating many diseases with different symptoms but the same source. For example, due to the joints of steel rails and the inability of the roadbed to be absolutely stable, and the high speed of locomotives, the vibration of vehicles is relatively large, which causes many special problems on the railway, such as impact force, loose connections, and material wear. Furthermore, since the routes are scattered far and wide, and vehicles run everywhere, and these production tools are exposed to the natural climate, the effects of sunny and rainy weather, cold and heat (such as cracking, frost damage, water rust, and insect infestation) cause erosion and decay of materials, threatening the economy and safety of driving. Furthermore, railway transportation is non-stop day and night. Materials and parts in continuous motion often experience "fatigue," which affects material strength and mechanical sensitivity. These are all caused by the characteristics of railway transportation. Therefore, phenomena such as vibration, exposure, and fatigue constitute key issues in the systematization of railway technology. Solving these key issues requires profound theories and should be the main research direction of railway science. Here, the assistance and guidance of relevant institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences are very necessary.
    The Issue of Organization and Planning of Research Work. Compared with production or education work, research work has many differences. The content, progress, and required manpower and resources of a research topic are difficult to estimate accurately. Therefore, during research, the organization of manpower is sometimes forced to change, and the work plan sometimes inevitably becomes a formality. However, this is not the general situation. Under the conditions of complete data and full preparation, research work can still be organized and planned, such as meteorology and earthquakes can be predicted. The key lies in recognizing the purpose and essence of the topic, using correct research methods and appropriate inspection systems. In particular, it is necessary to master Soviet research materials and avoid detours.
    The Issue of Research Strength. The strength of our country's scientific team is weak. Research work must rely on the wisdom of the masses to have greater development. This not only refers to the staff participating in the research topic, but mainly refers to the vast number of employees in the business field. The source of a research topic is the railway field, and the research results will rely on field promotion in the future. Therefore, in the research process, contact and cooperation with the masses in the field should be strived for. In fact, many rationalization proposals in the field are of great enlightenment to research work, especially suggestions related to the topic. The number of topics that the institute itself can conduct is very limited. If the employees in the field have been considering other important technical problems for a long time, but are unable to study due to lack of instruments and books, if they can come to the institute to be stationed and helped by the staff of the institute, and solve the problem, it is equivalent to giving play to the potential power of scientific research. Further on this basis, with the institute as the center, organizing scientific work networks of various sizes in the railway field, and conducting scientific research of different degrees, will be a vision for developing railway research work.
    The Issue of Economic Accounting of Research Work. During the railway recovery period, some technicians had the mistaken idea of only completing tasks and not doing economic accounting. This idea still prevails among today's researchers, and the reason is that it is impossible to set indicators for the amount of research work and quotas for labor productivity. This is consistent with the argument that research work cannot be planned. However, this is an incorrect statement, treating the special as the general, and using the word "research" as a "shield" to cover up all waste and shortcomings in the work. In fact, "rework" and "waste products" in research work are inevitable, but can be reduced to a minimum. Therefore, the key is still the issue of ideological understanding. If we deeply realize that research work is precisely to develop production and practice thrift for the country, and start from calculating the cost of research work, and then estimate the role of its results in production, in order to gradually achieve the accounting of its economic value, then the quality of research work will certainly be improved, and it will increasingly become the most powerful weapon for the country to accumulate wealth. Therefore, although an economic accounting system cannot be established in research institutions for the time being, researchers must first establish the idea of economic accounting.
    The Issue of Researchers' Thinking. In addition to the above two issues of economic accounting and work planning, which prominently show the ideological obstacles among researchers, the following ideological issues are also discovered from time to time. One is the lack of confidence in completing tasks, often succumbing to objective conditions and letting things take their course. The second is the lack of an overall concept of research work, regarding the topic as the affair of one person or a group, and not being good at organizing all relevant forces to carry out collectively. The third is subjectivism in looking at problems, regarding the temporary as permanent, and the one-sided as comprehensive, so the results in the laboratory cannot be promoted in the field. The fourth is the unclear service, sometimes committing departmentalism, not caring about anything except the railway; sometimes only looking at the future and ignoring the present; sometimes emphasizing theory and deviating from reality; sometimes aiming too high and looking far away, despising small problems, and not paying attention to its huge impact. All these ideas are very harmful to research work. They all belong to the category of bourgeois ideology. We must strengthen the study of dialectical materialism and improve the level of thinking in order to establish a correct work attitude and better serve railway transportation.
    The above understandings are of course only preliminary experiences. Many other issues that have a major relationship with research work, such as training cadres, improving the theoretical level; adjusting institutions, strengthening research strength; establishing a scientific work information network, exchanging experience; carrying out free academic debates, promoting the atmosphere of academic research; concentrating the use of special scientific data and instruments and equipment, etc., are general opinions of the scientific community, so I will not say more here.
    Railway transportation is an important task in our Five-Year Plan, and railway research work is an important factor in ensuring the completion of this task. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, scientific research work has received special attention and care from our Party and the country. Our railway research staff must work harder, conscientiously and diligently, and work tirelessly to strive for the completion of our great first Five-Year Plan!

    科学研究工作必须联系实际
    铁道部铁道研究所所长　茅以升
    科学研究工作怎样联系实际，这是一个急需解决的问题。对于这个问题，我愿就铁道研究所的情况加以论述，供大家参考。
    铁道运输是个庞大的企业，是完成国家运输的主要力量。在我们第一个五年计划中，国家对铁路的基本建设投资超过除工业外的任何其他部门。
    中国铁路已有八十多年历史。但在解放以前，它是为帝国主义侵略服务的，不可能对国民经济发挥它应有的作用。解放后，经过恢复扩建，推行了苏联先进经验，它和祖国的其他事业一样，有了完全崭新的面貌。我国铁路运输周转量，在一九五七年的一年内，货物将要达到一千二百多亿吨公里，旅客将要达到三百一十九亿多人公里。拿那年铁路长度两万八千多公里来说，这样巨大的“负荷量”在世界上是少见的。然而我国铁路的基础原是非常薄弱的，不但工具落后，而且标准规格异常混乱，虽经近几年的改进，但要担负这样巨大的运输量，仍然是十分困难的，必须大力地加强和改造现有铁路的技术装备，才能做到。在这加强和改造的过程中，所遇到的技术问题必然很多，都需要通过科学研究来解决，这就是我们铁道研究所的任务。
    铁道研究所成立于一九五○年三月，迄今已进行了一百几十个研究专题并为铁道部和现场作了不少技术工作。其中有若干项研究工作已经对铁路现场起了较大作用。至于较有成绩的专题，为数亦不在少。这些工作的目的都是为了提高铁道运输量或降低成本，其确实数字虽然一时尚难估计，但因铁道是个庞大企业，所需生产工具的数量，也特别大，任何小的改善，累积起来，都成巨大数字。如枕木防腐研究，如能使全国铁路枕木的寿命延长一年，即可为国家节约财富一亿元。又如一项较小的研究工作，货车上旧篷布防雨能力的恢复，在现场推广后，每年已可节约三百万元。
    从它五年半的历史来看，铁道研究所的这些工作是非常不够的。这主要是由于我们在创所初期，走了许多弯路，费了很大代价来摸索经验。同时，为了工作人员的培养，工作上也受了些影响。直到
  一九五三年，全部研究人员都突击学习了俄文以后，搜集了俄文资料并学习了苏联先进的研究方法，我们的工作才逐步纳入正轨，有了起色。同时，同铁路现场的联系以及同其他研究机构和高等学校的关系，也日益密切，因而能够打下初步基础。根据这几年的经验，我们有以下几点认识。
    研究工作的任务问题。顾名思义，铁道研究工作当然应该为铁道运输服务，也就是在提高铁道运输效率的要求上，负有解决技术问题的主要责任。这些问题的产生是由于：第一，要对铁路的“基本生产工具”进行技术改造，建立现代化的装备，包括旧装备的革新，新装备的“定型”，以及新路线的设计规范的拟定；第二，要提高使用生产工具的效率，包括固定资产，如钢轨、枕木等寿命的延长，以及消耗材料，如机车用煤和润滑油的节约；第三，要使新技术能在铁路上广泛运用，发掘现有潜力；第四，要在铁道运输中，贯彻“满载超轴五百公里”的运动。有人以为在铁路的基本生产工具中，几乎所有的材料（如钢轨、枕木）和机具（如机车、车辆）都是其他企业部门生产的，而在运输业务的技术上又有苏联的先进经验作榜样，因而铁道本身的研究工作就不会太多。但是采用材料和机具要有规格和定型，学习苏联经验要结合本国的具体情况，甚至同一理论问题，在苏联已经解决了，而在我国铁路上，由于工具的质料和使用时的环境不同，还不能直接应用。因此，铁道研究工作的任务不但是繁重的而且是综合性的，包括了铁道的各个部门。有时由于需要，还包括属于其他企业部门的原材料的研究工作。在这里，铁道研究工作如何同其他企业部门的研究工作相互配合，协调进行，避免重复和遗漏，是一个亟待调整平衡的问题。这在第一个五年计划中，已有明确规定了。
    研究工作的方向问题。由于铁道的基本生产工具包括了几乎所有各种工业的产品，在选择、组织和运用这些产品时，就必然会遇到大量的复杂的技术问题。为了解决这些问题，就要有明确的研究方向，才不致于头痛医头，枝节从事，或者轻重倒置，或者预见不足。我们曾经试图对铁道的技术问题，分析其本质，按其重要性和相互关系，订出一套系统，就好像画出一棵树的根株枝叶一样，然后遇一问题，就可在这树上给它一个应占的位置，从而看出它们的轻重缓急，并可发现即将到来的问题。这个工作我们称为“技术系统化”。此外，在铁道技术的各种问题中，进一步来发现究竟有哪些问题是有共同性的、关键性的，解决了这样一个问题，就等于医治了同一病源而症候各别的许多病。比如，由于钢轨有接头，路基不能绝对平稳，而机车行驶的速度高，因而车辆的震动是比较大的，这就引起铁路上的许多特殊问题，如冲击力，联结松弛，材料磨耗等。又如，由于路线散布很远，车辆到处奔驰，而这些生产工具又都是暴露于自然气候之下的，因而晴雨寒暑的影响（如干裂、冻害、水锈、虫蛀等）就引起了对材料的侵蚀和腐朽，威胁着行车的经济和安全。再如，铁道运输是日夜不停的，在继续不断的运动中的材料和机件，时常发生“疲劳”现象，因而影响到材料强度和机械的灵敏性。这都是由于铁道运输的特点而产生的，因而震动、暴露、疲劳等现象就构成铁道技术系统化中的关键性问题。解决这些关键性问题需要有高深理论，应当是铁道科学的主要研究方向。在这里，中国科学院各有关研究所的协助和指示是非常必需的。
    研究工作的组织计划问题。研究工作比起生产或教育工作，有很多不同之点。一个研究专题的内容、进度和所需的人力、物力，是很难精确估计的。因而在进行研究时，人力的组织有时被迫变更，工作的计划有时也不免流于形式。然而这并非一般的情况。在资料齐全、准备充分的条件下，研究工作仍然是可以有组织性和计划性的，如气象和地震就都可预报。关键在于认清专题的目的和本质，使用正确的研究方法和适当的检查制度。特别是要能掌握苏联的研究资料，少走弯路。
    研究工作的力量问题。我国科学队伍的力量是薄弱的。研究工作必须依靠群众智慧，才能有更大的发展。这不仅指参加研究专题的工作人员，而主要是对业务现场的广大职工而言。一个研究专题的来源是铁路现场，将来研究成果更要靠现场推广。那么，在研究当中，同现场群众的联系合作，就应当努力争取。事实上，现场上的许多合理化建议对研究工作是有很大的启示作用的，特别是对专题有关的建议。研究所本身所能进行的专题是很有限的，假如现场的职工，对其他重要技术问题，久有考虑，而因缺乏仪器图书，无法研究，倘若能来研究所驻勤，由所内人员予以帮助，就此把问题解决，这就无异于发挥了科学研究的潜在力量。由此再进一步，以研究所为中心，在铁路现场，组织起大小成套的科学工作网，进行不同程度的科学研究，这将是开展铁道研究工作的一个远景。
    研究工作的经济核算问题。在铁路恢复时期，技术人员中曾有只管完成任务不要经济核算的错误思想。这个思想在今天的研究人员当中，仍然普遍地存在着，其理由是无法定出研究工作量的指标和劳动生产率的定额。这和研究工作不能计划化的论点是一致的。然而这是一种不正确的说法，把特殊的当作了普遍的，把研究两字当作“挡箭牌”，来掩护工作中的一切浪费和缺点。实际上，研究工作中的“返工”“废品”虽不可免，但可以减到最低限度，所以关键仍是思想认识问题。如果深刻认识到研究工作正是要为国家发展生产，厉行节约，而从计算研究工作的成本开始，然后估计其成果在生产中的作用，以期逐步做到其经济价值的核算，那么，研究工作的质量必可提高，而日益成为国家累积财富最有力的武器。因此，在研究机构中，一时虽还不能建立经济核算的制度，但研究人员一定要先树立经济核算的思想。
    研究人员的思想问题。除了上述的经济核算和工作计划化的两个问题突出地表现出研究人员中的思想障碍而外，还有下列思想问题，也不时地发现。一是对于完成任务的信心不强，时常屈服于客观条件，放任自流。二是对于研究工作的整体观念不够，把专题看做是一人或一组的事，而不善于组织所有有关的力量，集体进行。三是主观主义看问题，把一时的看作永久的，片面的看作全面的，因而试验室中的成果，不能在现场推广。四是如何服务不明确，有时犯本位主义，除铁路外概不过问；有时只看将来而忽略现在；有时强调理论，脱离实际；有时好高鹜远，轻视小问题，而不注意它的巨大影响。所有这些思想，对于研究工作都是十分有害的，它们都属于资产阶级思想的范畴，必须加强学习辩证唯物主义，提高思想水平，才能树立正确的工作态度，更好地为铁道运输服务。
    以上这些认识，当然还只是初步体会。对于研究工作有重大关系的许多其他问题，如培养干部，提高理论水平；调整机构，加强研究力量；建立科学工作情报网，交流经验；开展学术上的自由争论，发扬学术研究气氛；集中使用特殊的科学资料和仪器设备等等，因是科学界的一般意见，这里就不多说了。
    铁道运输是我们五年计划中的重要任务，铁道研究工作是保证完成这个任务的一个重要因素。建国以来，科学研究工作受到我们党和国家的特别重视和关怀，我们铁道研究工作人员必须加倍努力，兢兢业业，坚持不懈地辛勤劳动，为完成我们伟大的第一个五年计划而奋斗！
