    Deep Impression
    —After Seeing the Japanese Kabuki Performance in Beijing
    Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, Tian Han
    Only after leaving the theater did I realize that the streets were wet with Beijing's autumn rain. The raindrops and cool breeze made me feel a slight shiver, but the beautiful stage images created by the artists from our neighboring country and the profound artistic excitement they gave us lingered in my mind.
    Decades ago, I lived in Japan for quite some time and occasionally went to the Imperial Theater and Kabuki-za to see Japanese national theater. But at that time, my main interest was to get close to the new Western European drama through the introduction of Japanese literary and art workers. I didn't pay enough attention to Japanese Kabuki. Because I did not approach it, nor seriously study it, I did not develop a love for it. Not understanding Japanese Kabuki is a great regret for a drama researcher, and only today did I have the opportunity to make up for this deficiency.
    Indeed, China and Japan are so close, but the cultural exchange between the two peoples is not intimate and in-depth enough. Mr. Mei Lanfang has performed Peking Opera in Japan, and Japanese Kabuki was performed in Shanghai by the famous Japanese actor Kanya Morita more than ten years ago, but that was mainly for the Japanese in Shanghai. This performance marks the true beginning of introducing this excellent drama genre from our neighbor to the Chinese people. When the Beijing audience saw the embroidered curtain rise with the sound of the clapper, revealing a scene they had never encountered before, when Togashi, stepping on his brocade hakama, sat down in front of the barrier, and when Benkei appeared from the "hanamichi" after the four warriors and Yoshitsune disguised as a coolie, everyone laughed with joy. The freshness of this unique art form gave us so much joy and enlightenment!
    Kabuki is fresh to the Chinese audience, but not unfamiliar. Its method of expression has a close blood relationship with Chinese drama. Its dance, breathing, posing, etc. are very easy for us to understand. Since China, like Japan, has long been subjected to feudal oppression, it is also very easy to understand the thoughts and feelings, and struggles of the oppressed people depicted in the play.
    It should be said that "Kanjincho" left a particularly deep impression on the Beijing audience. We also have many such "passing the barrier" plays, which often rely on amazing wit and bravery to escape danger. "Kanjincho" shows the wit and bravery of the Japanese people, so this play has been performed for hundreds of years and still has an audience. After Minamoto no Yoritomo defeated the Taira clan and seized power, he became suspicious of meritorious officials and turned against his own flesh and blood, persecuting his brother Yoshitsune, who had fought for him and made countless contributions in battle. The people sympathized with Yoshitsune's tragic end, and therefore loved Benkei, who used his extraordinary courage and wisdom to protect Yoshitsune and overcome dangers and difficulties several times. Benkei's name is not found in official history, but he lives in folk legends. His final fate was also tragic. Due to the strictness of the net, the warriors who followed Yoshitsune in his escape were all sacrificed one after another, and Benkei finally committed seppuku. His head was soaked in wine and sent to Minamoto no Yoritomo in Kamakura. Yoshitsune and Benkei failed, but their story is still performed on the stage today, and children still play Yoshitsune and Benkei games in schools.
    Mr. Sarunosuke Ichikawa's Benkei is exceptionally well-performed. The solemn and valiant expression, and the clear and decisive enunciation of words made our playwright Comrade Cao Yu clap his hands for every brilliant performance of this old artist. It is said that Mr. Ichikawa's father, Danshiro, was also good at this play, and the Japanese audience could imagine his father's demeanor from Mr. Ichikawa's acting skills. Mr. Ichikawa is not very tall, but his eyes are piercing. The final pose on the Hanamichi, with his eyes wide open, is completely close to the style of our famous Peking Opera actors. The Japanese once briefly commented on the famous actors who played Benkei, saying that Koshiro was the Benkei of posture; Uzaemon was the Benkei of the ears; Kichiemon was the Benkei of voice; Kikugoro was the Benkei of dance; and Sarunosuke was the Benkei of the eyeballs. I think the Japanese critics are right. This is a very demanding play. Mr. Ichikawa is the same age as our President Ouyang Yuqian, sixty-seven years old, and it is very rare that he still performs with such vigor. This also reminds people of what he said at our welcome banquet, that he was "going to use all his strength to repay the Chinese people." He did.
    The versatile Mr. Ichikawa, who played Benkei, is now playing "Stuttering Yatahei." This play is about a poor artist's supreme sincerity for art combined with his selfless care for others in need. Mr. Ichikawa organized his performance precisely from the requirements of this character portrayal. He did not exaggerate the flaw of stuttering, but from the action of grasping his throat and tearing his mouth, you can see the grief and indignation of a person full of loyalty and righteousness who cannot gain the trust of others.
    "Stuttering Yatahei" is also known as "Courtesan's Revived Incense." Some people say that this sounds like a Cantonese opera title. In fact, the story is quite complex and was originally divided into three volumes, upper, middle, and lower. Only a section of the upper volume is performed here. It's a pity that there is not enough time to discuss it in detail here.
    "The Two Butterflies in Dojoji Temple" precisely depicts the pathetic struggles of young Japanese men and women in the old society. We say, "The old society turns people into ghosts, and the new society turns ghosts into people." Kiyohime, the daughter of the village head of Hidaka Village under feudal oppression, will vigorously pursue her love for the monk Anchin and turn into a vengeful incarnation of a snake under the great bell. The great bell that covers the beautiful Kiyohime is symbolic. This great bell still hangs over the heads of many Eastern women today. Burn it with fierce fire.
    Matsuko Ichikawa's acting skills have maintained her standard over the years. A strong and unyielding atmosphere is always貫徹贯彻贯彻 in such gentleness and beauty, which expresses the character traits of the characters in the play and also expresses the characteristics of Japanese national dance art.
    Regarding the arrangement of the program, I once suggested putting "Stuttering Yatahei" first, "Dojoji Temple" in the middle, and letting "Kanjincho" be the finale, so that the weight of the play would be more appropriate, and the protagonist could also get a rest. There are not many artists like Mr. Ichikawa in Japan, and we should cherish them like our own national treasures.

### 深刻的印象——日本歌舞伎在北京的演出观后

    深刻的印象
    ——日本歌舞伎在北京的演出观后
    中国戏剧家协会主席  田汉
    走出了剧场才发现街上濡湿着北京的秋雨，雨点和凉风使我感到轻微的颤抖，但邻国艺人们造成的美丽的舞台形象和给我们的深刻的艺术激动久久不能忘掉。
    数十年前我在日本住过好些时候，偶然也到帝国剧场和歌舞伎座去观光过日本民族戏剧。但当时我主要的兴趣是通过日本文艺工作者的介绍亲近西欧的新演剧，对于日本歌舞伎注意是不够的。不接近它，不认真研究它，因而没有引起对它的热爱。不了解日本歌舞伎对于一个戏曲研究者是极大的缺憾，直到今天我才有机会弥补这个缺憾。
    的确，中日两国隔得如此的近，而两国人民的文艺上的相互交流是不够亲切和深入的。梅兰芳先生到日本演出过京剧，而日本的歌舞伎十几年前虽曾由日本名优守田勘弥在上海演出过，但那主要是演给上海的日本人看的，真正向中国人民介绍这一邻国的优秀剧种是以这次为始。当北京观众看到绣幕随着拍板的声音拉起，在他们面前启开一幅他们从未接触过的画面的时候，当富樫踏着他自己锦袴坐到关前，当弁庆继四勇士和化装成苦力的义经之后从“花道”登场的时候，大家都欢喜得笑起来了，这一种独特的艺术形式的新鲜感给了我们多大的欢悦和启示啊！
    歌舞伎对中国观众是新鲜的，但不是陌生的。它的表现方法跟中国戏剧有着亲密的血缘，它的舞姿，呼吸，亮相等等我们非常容易了解它们。中国既然跟日本一样长期受着封建压迫，对剧中所表现的被压迫者的思想感情，斗争生活，也非常容易领会。
    应该说：“劝进帐”是给北京观众印象特别深的。这样的“过关戏”我们也有不少，每每靠着惊人的机智和勇敢才能脱险。“劝进帐”就是表现了日本人民的机智，勇敢，所以这个戏才能演出几百年还是有观众。源赖朝打败平氏取得政权之后猜忌功臣，并且骨肉相残，多方迫害替他打天下，立过无数汗马功劳的他兄弟义经，人民是同情义经的悲惨结果的，因而也喜爱以过人的勇敢智慧保护义经几次克服危险困难的弁庆。弁庆的名字是不见于正史的，但活在民间传说之中。他的最后结局也是悲惨的。由于罗网的严密，跟随义经逃亡的那些勇士们都次第牺牲了，弁庆最后也切腹自杀，他的头被人浸在酒里送给在镰仓的源赖朝。义经和弁庆是失败了，但至今舞台上还演着他们的故事，学校里还做着义经和弁庆的游戏。
    市川猿之助先生的弁庆是演得非常出色的。凝重而骠悍的表情，斩钉截铁如火如荼的吐字，我们的剧作家曹禺同志一直为着这老艺术家的每一精采表演击节。据说市川先生的父亲段四郎也是擅长此剧的，日本观众曾从市川先生的演技想见他父亲的风貌。市川先生不甚高大而眼光炯炯有神，最后在花道上的亮相，圆睁巨眼，与我们京剧名优的风格完全逼近。日本人曾这样简评演过弁庆的名伶，说幸四郎是架子的弁庆；羽左卫门是耳朵的弁庆；吉右卫门是声音的弁庆；菊五郎是舞蹈的弁庆；而猿之助是眼珠的弁庆。我以为日本批评家是说对了的。这是一出十分吃重的戏，市川先生与我们欧阳予倩院长同年也已六十七岁，而演得始终那样精神饱满是十分难得的。这也使人想起他在我们欢迎宴会上说的话，他是“将拼着气力来酬答中国人民的”。他是这样做了。
    演过弁庆的多才多艺的市川先生现在又演“口吃的又平”了。这戏是写一个穷艺术家对艺事的无上精诚结合着他对别人缓急的献身的关怀。市川先生正是从这一性格描写的要求出发来组织他的表演，他没有夸张口吃的缺憾，而你从那抓喉裂嘴的动作看出一个满腔忠义而无法取信于人的悲愤感情。
    “口吃的又平”又名“倾城返魂香”，有人说，这像一个广东戏名。实则故事颇为复杂，原分上中下三卷。这里演的只是上卷的一段。可惜这里来不及仔细谈及。
    “双蝶道成寺”正是写日本青年男女在旧社会中的可怜的挣扎。我们说“旧社会把人变成鬼，新社会把鬼变成人。”在封建压迫下的日高村村长的女儿清姬就会猛烈追求对安珍和尚的爱而变成大钟下怨愤化身的蛇。那把美丽的清姬罩下来的大钟是带着象征性的。这一口大钟于今还悬在许多东方妇女的头上，用猛火烧掉它吧。
    市川松茑的演技是保持了他多年来的水准的。在如此柔和婉丽中间始终贯彻着一股刚健不屈的气氛，这表现了剧中的人物特质也表现日本民族舞蹈艺术的特质。
    关于节目的排列，我曾提议把“口吃的又平”摆在第一，“道成寺”居中，而让“劝进帐”压轴，这样剧的分量较合适，主角也可以得到休息。日本像市川先生这样的艺术家也是不多的，我们应该当自己的国宝一样的爱护他们。
