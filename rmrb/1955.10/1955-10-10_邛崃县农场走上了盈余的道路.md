To the Editor:

    Our Qionglai County Farm has achieved a bumper harvest of various crops this year. Compared to last year, rice production increased by 12.3 percent, wheat by 10.3 percent, rapeseed by 23 percent, and cotton, sweet potatoes, and the trial planting of double-cropping corn also showed signs of a bumper harvest. The total income of the farm's 112.04 mu of land is estimated to be more than 9,500 yuan, with total expenditures of more than 6,000 yuan. Including income from sideline occupations, the annual surplus will be more than 5,000 yuan.

    I remember when I first came to Qionglai County Farm in July 1953, the farm management was chaotic, production was poor, and it lost more than 2,000 yuan. As a result, the masses had a very bad impression of the farm. At that time, the County Party Secretary told me that the Party wanted me to manage this farm well and reverse the negative political impact. Although I felt there were many difficulties, the sense of responsibility of a Communist Party member constantly urged me to work hard to complete the task assigned to me by the Party.

    I knew that to manage the farm well, on the one hand, I must rely on the workers, and on the other hand, I must transform myself from an outsider to an insider. So I went deep into the fields to understand the workers' thoughts and carry out ideological education work, and to solve the difficulties in their lives with concern. At the same time, I also clearly told them how much the state had invested in our farm, so that they could discuss the reasons for the past losses and ways to improve production based on the state's investment and the farm's production situation, so that they gradually established the idea of taking the farm as their home and the attitude of being masters of their own affairs. I also diligently studied production management work and led the workers to adopt various advanced experiences and improve farming techniques.

    Thanks to the County Party Committee's attention to and correct leadership of the farm's work, coupled with the above-mentioned efforts, our farm underwent significant changes in 1954. The corn we planted achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in the county due to the adoption of improved varieties and advanced technologies, with the highest yield reaching 812 jin per mu; the harvest of other crops was also very good. The production income, after deducting the state's investment and repaying old debts, was used to build a new pigsty that could accommodate more than 200 pigs. In this way, the farm's reputation immediately spread throughout the county, and a steady stream of farmers came to visit every day. After inspection by the higher authorities, Qionglai County Farm was rated as one of the two first-class farms in Wenjiang Prefecture.

    This situation greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of our farm's employees. For example, Cui Fuwen of the sideline occupation group could not raise 28 pigs well the year before last, raised 80 pigs last year, and this year increased it to 108 pigs, and also took the time to plant millet and melons as feed. During this year's autumn harvest, workers generally exceeded their labor quotas.

    The relationship between our farm and the nearby farmers has also become increasingly close. The Jieying Village Agricultural Cooperative in the vicinity learned all of the farm's farming methods this year, so their more than 35 mu of wheat averaged 369 jin per mu, which is the highest yield among all agricultural cooperatives in the county. For example, the farmers in Yanxian Village near the farm have always lacked cattle power, transplanted rice seedlings late, and had very low yields. This year, our farm rented five large water buffaloes to them for plowing early, so that more than 36 mu of land could be transplanted early, and the harvest was particularly good. Therefore, during this year's autumn harvest, farmers from neighboring villages also organized labor to help the farm harvest.

### 邛崃县农场走上了盈余的道路

    邛崃县农场走上了盈余的道路编辑同志：
    我们邛崃县农场今年各种作物都获得了丰收。比起去年来，水稻增产百分之十二点三，小麦增产百分之十点三，油菜增产百分之二十三，棉花、红苕和试种的二季玉米也都显出了丰收景象。全场一百一十二亩零四分田地，预计总收入有九千五百多元，总支出六千多元，加上副业的收入，全年将盈余五千多元。
    记得一九五三年七月份我初来邛崃县农场时，农场管理混乱，生产搞得不好，赔本两千多元，因此群众对农场的印象很坏。当时，县委书记对我说，党要我把这个农场搞好，把不良的政治影响挽回过来。我虽然感到困难很多，但是共产党员的责任感不断督促着我努力完成党交给我的这个任务。
    我知道，要把农场搞好，一方面必须依靠工人群众，另外一方面还须要使自己变外行为内行。于是我就深入到田间去了解工人的思想情况和进行思想教育工作，关心地解决他们生活中的困难，同时又明白地告诉他们国家对我场投资多少，让他们根据国家投资和农场的生产情况讨论过去赔本的原因和搞好生产的办法，使他们逐渐树立了以农场为家的思想和主人翁的态度。我还刻苦地学习生产管理工作，领导工人采用各种先进经验，改进耕作技术。
    由于县委对农场工作的重视和正确领导，再加上以上这样一番努力，一九五四年我们农场有了显著的变化。我们所种的玉米由于采用了良种和先进技术，获得了全县空前未有的丰收，最高产量一市亩达到八百一十二斤；其他农作物收成也很好。生产收入除去国家投资和付还旧欠以外，还新修了一所可以容纳二百多头猪的圈房。这样，农场的声誉立即传遍了全县各地，每天川流不息的农民前来参观。经过上级检查，邛崃县农场被评为温江专区两个甲等农场中的一个。
    这种情况，大大地激发了我场职工们的劳动热情。如副业组崔福文，前年喂二十八头猪都喂不好，去年喂了八十头，今年提高到喂一百零八头，还抽空种了粟子和瓜类等饲料。今年秋收中，工人普遍超过了劳动定额。
    我们农场同附近农民群众的关系也愈来愈密切了。邻近的届营村农业社，今年生产全部都学农场的耕作方法，因此他们的三十五亩多小麦平均每亩产到三百六十九斤，是全县农业社最高的产量。又如农场附近的沿贤村农民，因为历来牛力缺乏，栽秧迟，产量很低；今年我们农场及早租了五条大水牛给他们耕田，使三十六亩多田能够提早栽秧，收成特别好。因此，今年秋收的时候，邻近村子的农民，也组织劳动力来帮助农场收割。
