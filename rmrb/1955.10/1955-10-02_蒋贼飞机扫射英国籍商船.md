    Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Planes Strafe British Merchant Ship
    On September 30th, Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes strafed the British merchant ship "De Gao" near the port of Shantou, Guangdong Province.
    At 9:13 AM on September 30th, four American-made Chiang Kai-shek F-84 type planes intruded into the airspace outside Mayu Island in the port of Shantou, Guangdong Province. Two of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes conducted two dive-bombing strafing runs on the merchant ship "De Gao," flying under the British flag, which was sailing in the nearby waters, and then flew east. The "De Gao"'s radio receiver and a warehouse were damaged by the strafing, and two crew members were injured. British engineer McGarry sustained minor injuries; Chinese crew member Zhang Rong was more seriously injured and has been sent to the hospital for treatment.
    After the American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes strafed the ship, the Shantou local authorities immediately sent representatives to the ship to express their condolences. Ma Cheng, the captain of the "De Gao," described the circumstances of the Chiang Kai-shek planes' strafing of the ship to the representatives who came to the ship to express their condolences. He believed that the Chiang Kai-shek planes' act of strafing the ship was "a kind of murder" against them.

    九月三十日，蒋贼飞机在广东省汕头港口附近海面扫射英国籍商船“德高号”。
    三十日上午九时十三分，美制蒋贼F—八四型飞机四架侵入广东省汕头港口马屿岛外上空，其中两架蒋贼机对正在附近海面行驶的悬有英国旗帜的
  “德高号”商船进行两次俯冲扫射，旋即向东飞去。“德高号”船上的无线电收报机和舱库一处被扫射损坏，两名船员受伤。英国籍的轮机手麦加利受轻伤；中国籍的船员张荣受伤较重，现已送到医院救治。
    汕头市地方当局在美制蒋贼机扫射该船后，即派代表到船上慰问。“德高号”船长马程向到船上慰问的代表叙述蒋贼机扫射该船的情况，他认为蒋贼机这次对该船扫射的暴行是对他们的“一种谋杀”。
