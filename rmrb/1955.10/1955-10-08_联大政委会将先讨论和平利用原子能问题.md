Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 6th (TASS dispatch): The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the 5th. After electing the vice-chairmen and rapporteur of the committee, the meeting discussed the order of consideration of the items on the agenda. The items on the committee's agenda include: disarmament, measures for further easing international tension and developing international cooperation (proposed by the Soviet delegation), peaceful uses of atomic energy, the effects of atomic radiation, the Algerian question, the Moroccan question, the Korean question, and the West Irian question.

The Colombian representative suggested that the peaceful uses of atomic energy issue be discussed first, and then the order of discussion of other items on the agenda be decided. This suggestion was seconded by the Indian representative and unanimously adopted by the committee.

Soviet representative Kuznetsov pointed out that the agenda included important political issues. The Soviet delegation believes that the issue of disarmament should be given a comprehensive and unhurried discussion. The Soviet delegation does not object to the committee first discussing the peaceful uses of atomic energy issue, but at the same time believes that after discussing this issue, the various issues related to disarmament, including the measures proposed by the Soviet Union for further easing international tension and developing international cooperation, should be discussed first.

    联大政委会将先讨论和平利用原子能问题
    新华社七日讯　据塔斯社纽约六日讯：联合国大会政治委员会五日举行会议。会议在选出了委员会的副主席和报告员以后，讨论了议程上的项目的审议次序问题。委员会议程上的项目有：裁减军备，进一步缓和国际紧张局势和发展国际合作的措施（苏联代表团提出），和平利用原子能，原子放射的影响，阿尔及利亚问题，摩洛哥问题，朝鲜问题以及西伊里安问题。
    哥伦比亚代表建议首先讨论和平利用原子能问题，然后再决定讨论议程上其他项目的次序。这个建议得到印度代表的附议，并且为委员会所一致通过。
    苏联代表库兹涅佐夫指出，议程上包括了重要的政治问题。苏联代表团认为，对于裁军问题，应该加以全面的、从容不迫的讨论。苏联代表团不反对委员会首先讨论和平利用原子能问题，同时认为在讨论这个问题以后应该首先讨论和裁军有关的各个问题，包括苏联提出的关于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和发展国际合作的措施问题在内。
