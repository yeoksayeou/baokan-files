Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 12th - Iranian Prime Minister Hossein Ala announced at a meeting of the Iranian Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee on the 11th that his government had decided to join the Turkish-Iraqi military pact signed in Baghdad in February this year under the instigation of the United States. He said that he had formally notified the Turkish and Iraqi ambassadors to Iran of this decision and would request parliamentary approval in the form of an emergency bill. Iran is the fifth country to join the military pact, following Britain and Pakistan.

According to an Associated Press report from the 11th, Senator Divan Beig delivered a half-hour speech at the Iranian Senate Foreign Affairs Committee meeting, expressing opposition to joining the Turkish-Iraqi treaty. On the same day in the lower house, the opposition spokesman expressed opposition to Iran's participation in the Turkish-Iraqi treaty, saying that Iran's participation in this treaty was "of no benefit."

According to a Reuters report from Washington, U.S. State Department officials privately pointed out that Iran was one of the Middle Eastern "top-tier countries" that Dulles "had always hoped" would join the Middle East military pact.

Prior to this, the "Al-Ahram" correspondent in Istanbul quoted informed sources as reporting: "Negotiations are underway between Washington and Tehran regarding the establishment of U.S. military bases in Iran." The reporter wrote: "These informed sources explained that after Iran officially joins the Turkish-Iraqi treaty, an agreement on U.S. military bases in Iran will be signed."

    伊朗首相宣布
    伊朗政府决定参加土伊条约
    新华社十二日讯　德黑兰消息：伊朗首相侯赛尼·阿拉十一日在伊朗议会上院外交委员会会议上宣布，他的政府已经决定加入今年二月间在美国策动下在巴格达签订的土耳其—伊拉克军事条约。他说，他已经把这个决定正式通知土耳其和伊拉克驻伊朗的大使，并将以紧急法案的形式要求议会批准。伊朗是继英国、巴基斯坦之后，第五个参加这个军事条约的国家。
    据美联社十一日报道，在伊朗上院外交委员会会议上，上议员迪文·贝格曾作了半小时的发言，表示反对参加土耳其—伊拉克条约。同一天在下院，反对派的发言人表示反对伊朗参加土耳其—伊拉克条约。他说，伊朗参加这个条约是“没有好处的”。
    据路透社华盛顿消息说，美国国务院官员私下指出，伊朗是杜勒斯“一直希望”能加入中东军事条约的中东北层国家之一。
    在这以前，埃及“金字塔报”驻伊斯坦布尔记者曾援引消息灵通人士的话报道：“华盛顿和德黑兰之间正在进行关于在伊朗建立美国军事基地问题的谈判”。这个记者写道：“这些消息灵通人士说明，在伊朗正式参加土耳其—伊拉克条约之后，关于美国在伊朗的军事基地问题的协定就会签订。”
