    Panshi County Developed Over a Thousand Hectares of Paddy Fields This Year

    Panshi County, Jilin Province, has achieved remarkable results in building mass small-scale water conservancy projects and developing paddy fields. This year, the county has repaired and renovated more than 880 river dams; and newly built five reservoirs, more than 200 river dams and ponds, and installed two water pumps. Due to the completion of these small-scale water conservancy projects, the county has developed more than 1,360 hectares of paddy fields this year. It is estimated that these 1,300+ hectares of paddy fields can increase rice production by more than 3,500 tons this year.

    Panshi County is located in a mountainous area. There are 44 rivers of various sizes in the county, as well as many mountain streams and springs, making its water resources extremely rich. It also possesses natural terrain suitable for building reservoirs and ponds and other water conservancy projects. In order to further develop and utilize these water resources, the county has carried out comprehensive basin planning and launched a "three dams per village" campaign throughout the county, planning to build more small-scale water conservancy projects and develop 2,500 hectares of paddy fields from this autumn to next spring. It also plans to gradually expand all 30,000 hectares of dry land, wasteland meadows, and low-lying ponds suitable for development into paddy fields into paddy fields.

    磐石县今年开发了千多垧水田
    吉林省磐石县兴修群众性小型水利工程和开发水田工作获得显著成绩。今年全县共补修和改修了八百八十多处拦河坝；并新修了五座水库、二百多处拦河坝和塘坝，安装了两部抽水机。由于这些小型水利工程的完成，全县今年开发了一千三百六十多垧水田，据估计这一千三百多垧水田今年可增产水稻三千五百多吨。
    磐石县是一个处于山岳地带的县份，全县境内共有大小四十四条河流，还有许多山间溪流和泉水等，水利资源极为丰富，而且还具备了兴修水库及塘坝等水利工程的自然地形。为了进一步开发和利用这些水利资源，该县进行了全面的流域规划，并在全县内普遍开展“一村三坝”运动，计划全县从今秋到明春再增修小型水利工程、开发二千五百垧水田。并逐年地将全县适宜开发为水田的三万垧旱地、荒草甸子和洼塘地全部扩充为水田。
