Liaoning Province Aquatic Bureau's Dalian Aquatic Experiment Station dispatched a survey vessel in June to understand the province's Acetes resources along the Liaodong Bay. It is now clear that the Acetes production this autumn will exceed the same period last year. This news brought joy to the staff of state-owned aquatic companies in Yingkou, Gaiping, Jin County, and Suizhong in Liaoning Province. They plan to increase the production of twenty thousand yuan worth of wealth for the country in the autumn shrimp catching work that will begin in September. This year, Jin County and Yingkou regions added four motorized boats each to ensure the safety of offshore and mobile operations. In early September, these eight motorized boats had already begun towing fifty-seven fishing boats out to sea. After Jin County Aquatic Company used motorized boats to move to the shrimp-rich Yingkou waters in September to develop fishing grounds, the employees have increased the autumn shrimp catching plan for each boat from 50,000 jin to 80,000 jin. Currently, shrimp fishermen in various places are carrying out diversified production under the original tool conditions. They stated that they would catch an additional 150,000 jin of jellyfish, dig 200,000 jin of blood clams, and use snagging hooks to catch an additional 30,000 jin of fish to supply the needs of urban residents in the second half of the year.

    辽宁水产工人努力增产鱼虾
    辽宁省水产局所属大连水产试验场在今年六月份开始派出一艘探测船，沿着辽东湾了解全省毛虾资源，现经查明今年秋季的毛虾产量将超过去年同期。这一音讯给辽宁省营口、盖平、锦县、绥中等地国营水产公司的职工们带来了喜悦，他们要在今年九月份开始的秋季捕虾工作中，多为国家增产二十万元的财富。锦县、营口地区今年为保证远洋和运动作业的安全，各添置了四条机船，九月初，这八条带有马达的机船已开始拖着五十七条渔船出海了。锦县水产公司由于九月份利用机船运动到多虾的营口海面开辟网地后，职工们已将今年秋季每条船的捕虾计划从五万斤提高到八万斤。目前，各地捕虾工人在原有工具条件下，开展了多样性的生产，他们表示要在下半年多抓十五万斤海蜇，挖蚶子二十万斤，并利用滚钩多钓三万斤鱼供应城市居民需要。　（本报驻沈阳记者）
