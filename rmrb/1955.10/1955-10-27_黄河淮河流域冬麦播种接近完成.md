Xinhua News Agency, October 25th: Farmers in the Yellow River and Huai River basins, the main winter wheat producing areas, are actively overcoming the difficulties of drought in the south and flooding in the north, and are making a concentrated effort in autumn plowing and sowing. After a month of effort, the winter wheat sowing in these areas is nearing completion. The early sown wheat seedlings have emerged two to three inches and are growing well.

During this year's autumn plowing and sowing, excessive rainfall in Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong and other provinces has caused waterlogging in some low-lying areas; parts of Anhui Province and Jiangsu Province have suffered from drought due to prolonged lack of rain. All localities have quickly mobilized farmers to drain water or fight drought in order to sow winter wheat in a timely manner. In Hebei Province, agricultural producers' cooperatives have taken the lead in launching wheat sowing competitions, accelerating the pace of sowing.

All localities attach great importance to increasing the yield per unit area of winter wheat. Due to the large-scale promotion of double-wheeled double-shared plows, many areas have expanded the area of deep-plowed wheat fields. In Liaocheng Prefecture of Shandong Province, more than 72 percent of the wheat fields were deep-plowed, and in Jinan and Yuci Prefectures of Shanxi Province, more than 50 percent of the wheat fields were deep-plowed. The depth of cultivation was generally increased by one or two inches compared with previous years. Farmers in various places have adopted improved varieties, implemented seed dressing with pesticides, rational close planting, and increased fertilizer application. Henan Province promoted more than 30 million catties of improved winter wheat varieties. In Shandong Province, about 80 percent of the wheat fields were sown with improved varieties, an increase of more than 12 million mu compared with last year; in Taian, Qixia, Liaolan, Guantao, Shanxian, Enxian, Jiyang and other counties, 60 to 70 percent of the wheat fields were densely planted, an increase of more than 20 percent compared with last year; many agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams also increased the application of base fertilizer in wheat fields compared with last year. In Hebei Province, the area of wheat fields sown with seeds treated with pesticides in 22 counties in Tianjin, Xingtai, and Cangxian Prefectures exceeded the original plan; many areas further promoted close planting. In Jinan, Changzhi, Yuci and other prefectures of Shanxi Province, the area of densely planted wheat fields increased from 30 percent of the total wheat field area last year to more than 60 percent this year; in Xiangyuan, Jincheng and other counties, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of wheat field increased by about 10 dan compared with last year. Jiangsu Province supplied farmers with more than 14 million catties of improved winter wheat varieties; in Huaiyin Prefecture, the general amount of fertilizer applied per mu of wheat field was one to three picks, and in some cases more than seven picks. In Anhui Province, in addition to expanding the planting area of improved winter wheat varieties, farmers accumulated 1.1 billion dan of fertilizer for autumn planting. Shaanxi Province, according to the different conditions in the three regions of Guanzhong, southern Shaanxi, and northern Shaanxi, guided farmers to improve winter wheat production techniques in accordance with local conditions. In addition, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces also promoted the method of mixed planting of wheat and beans to increase grain production.

    黄河淮河流域冬麦播种接近完成
    新华社二十五日讯　冬小麦主要产区黄河、淮河流域的农民，积极克服南旱北涝的困难，突击进行秋耕秋种。经过一个月来的努力，这些地区的冬小麦播种工作已接近结束。早种的麦苗已出土二、三寸，生长良好。
    今年秋耕秋种中，河北、山西、陕西、河南、山东等省雨水过多，有些低洼地区发生内涝；安徽省和江苏省部分地区久不下雨，受到干旱威胁。各地都迅速发动农民排水或抗旱，争取适时种上冬小麦。河北省以农业生产合作社为主，普遍开展了种麦竞赛，加快了播种的速度。
    各地都很重视提高冬小麦的单位面积产量。由于双轮双铧犁的大量推广，许多地区扩大了深耕的麦田的面积。山东省聊城专区深耕的麦田达百分之七十二以上，山西省晋南、榆次等专区深耕的麦田也在百分之五十以上，耕作的深度一般都比往年增加了一、二寸。各地农民纷纷采用良种，实行药剂拌种、合理密植和增施肥料。河南省推广冬小麦良种三千多万斤。山东省有百分之八十左右的麦田播种了良种，比去年扩大一千二百多万亩；泰安、栖霞、蓼兰、馆陶、单县、恩县、济阳等县有百分之六十到七十的麦田实行了密植，比去年扩大百分之二十以上；许多农业生产合作社和互助组的麦田施用底肥也比去年增加。河北省天津、邢台、沧县三个专区二十二个县用药剂拌的种所播种的麦田面积，超过了原来的计划；许多地区进一步推行了密植。山西省晋南、长治、榆次等专区密植的麦田，由去年占麦田总面积百分之三十增加到今年的百分之六十以上；襄垣、晋城等县每亩麦田施肥量比去年增加十担左右。江苏省供应农民冬小麦良种一千四百多万斤；淮阴专区每亩麦田一般施肥一挑到三挑，多的达七挑以上。安徽省除扩大冬小麦良种的种植面积外，农民为秋种积肥达十一亿担。陕西省根据关中、陕南、陕北三类地区的不同情况，指导农民因地制宜改进冬小麦的生产技术。此外，河南、安徽、江苏等省还推广了麦、豆混种的办法，以增产粮食。
