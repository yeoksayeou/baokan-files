Ma Sicong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association, delivered the opening remarks.

Qian Junrui, Acting Minister of Culture, spoke at the memorial meeting. He said: Nie Er and Xian Xinghai’s entire artistic activities were subordinate to and served the task of the people’s revolution, truly worthy of the titles of horn of the times and voice of the people. Their creations had a high degree of popularity and mass character, inspiring and promoting the broad masses of the people to move forward continuously. All their activities were led by the communist worldview, and they both displayed the most vigorous and abundant creativity under the guidance of the Party's literary and artistic policies. Qian Junrui proposed that, in order to be worthy of the brilliant examples of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, all literary and art workers and music workers must take the tasks of realizing the socialist revolution and socialist construction put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao as the general program of all artistic and musical activities. We must ensure that all creative activities and artistic activities are coordinated with the tasks of socialist construction, more closely linked to the masses and deeply rooted in the people, adopt forms that they love to see and hear, encourage them to move forward, and promote the completion of the tasks of socialist revolution and construction. Qian Junrui asked all music workers to attach importance to national traditions like Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, to better sort out and study national and folk music, and to create a large number of songs, music, symphonies and operas with socialist content and expressed in national forms. He hoped that more national orchestras and national singing teams would appear in factories, mines, rural areas, armies, government offices, and schools, and that more national music would be heard in movies and dramas. He called on all literary and art workers and music workers to better strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and to lead all their artistic activities with a communist worldview. Qian Junrui finally pointed out that it is necessary to carry forward the spirit of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, who firmly stood on the position of the working class and waged tireless struggles against all reactionary and erroneous ideas. He proposed a comprehensive and systematic criticism of bourgeois musical ideas in the music world, such as detaching from politics, despising workers, peasants and soldiers, and despising national and folk music. He called on the music community to further unite and develop the direction of socialist realism in people's music laid by Nie Er and consolidated by Xian Xinghai to a more glorious future.

Yang Hansheng, Secretary-General of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, said in his speech: The new China that Nie Er and Xian Xinghai pursued, idealized, and struggled for has been realized. Now we are carrying out a socialist revolution, and the broad masses of the people urgently need music to encourage them to move forward. We must hold high the socialist realism banner of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, follow their path, create more and better musical works, and develop our musical work magnificently for the cause of socialism.
