Children in National Construction
Kang Keqing, Secretary-General of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of Children

Today is the sixth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland. People all over the country are celebrating this festival with joy. In front of Tiananmen Square in the capital, the beautiful ranks of children will once again enter the square with the huge crowd of hundreds of thousands of people, cheering. The parade shows the growing strength of the Chinese people in building and defending their motherland, encouraging us to complete the new tasks of the coming year with greater enthusiasm. This year, the Second National People's Congress passed the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy. The realization of this plan will lay a solid foundation for the happiness of the people of the whole country and our future generations.

In the past year, under the shining light of socialism, we have been changing the face of our motherland on an unprecedented scale and at an unprecedented speed. The lives of the people across the country have undergone significant changes, and children have received more care and love from the state and their parents. The work of protecting children has been carried out in all aspects. Parents have gradually realized that the old methods of beating, scolding, coaxing, scaring, or spoiling children are harmful, and they are actively learning new methods of correctly raising their children. For example, the publicity on children's family education conducted by various organs, schools, groups, and urban and rural women's grassroots organizations around "June 1st" this year was widely welcomed by the masses. An old woman in Beijing, upon hearing that a street reporter was going to talk about how to raise children, quickly said to the reporter, "Please wait a moment, let me call my daughter-in-law to listen as well." Feudal and superstitious customs that have harmed children's health for many years are gradually being eliminated. In cities and villages, most women have adopted scientific new methods of childbirth, thereby ensuring the lives and health of mothers and babies, and gradually relieving the pain caused by the feudal superstitions imposed on mothers and children. Disease prevention vaccinations and scientific child-rearing knowledge have been accepted by more and more people. When children get sick, the old methods of praying to gods, worshiping Buddha, burning incense, and calling souls have been replaced by the hard work of health care workers in vast areas.

With the development of the country's socialist industrialization and the large-scale cooperative movement in rural areas, more and more women have participated in social labor. In order to enable the children of the broad masses of working people to receive better upbringing when their parents participate in production and work, a variety of childcare organizations and kindergartens have developed rapidly. There are more than 4,000 nurseries for female workers in factories, mines, enterprises, schools, and organs across the country (nurseries and kindergartens in organs, troops, and rural areas that have not joined trade unions are not included in the statistics). Since the advocacy of establishing small-scale daytime childcare organizations, many organs have begun planning or are opening daytime kindergartens. Various street nurseries and agricultural busy season baby-holding mutual aid groups, which are suitable for the different needs of the masses and are run by the masses themselves, are being continuously promoted. For example, the number of street nurseries opened in more than 60 cities this year has increased by 61 percent compared to last year. In order to improve the quality of work in nurseries and kindergartens, in addition to the learning organized by various units for preschool teachers, various cities have held more professional training courses or training classes for preschool teachers this year than in previous years. Early childhood education research offices have also been established in Beijing and Tianjin.

During the first five-year plan, the funds we spent on general education and teacher training accounted for 5.54 percent of the total expenditure of the national five-year plan. The figure for "education expenditure" in this year's national budget is 28 times higher than the highest year of education expenditure budget during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government in 1946. Primary schools in various places have expanded their enrollment quotas, and private primary schools have also been encouraged, which will enable more children to have the opportunity to go to school. Many children of workers and peasants and children of ethnic minorities, whose ancestors have been illiterate for generations, have the opportunity to participate in learning with other children today. At present, in order to enable children to receive all-round development education in schools, our government has been improving the quality of education. In the past year, primary school teachers across the country have generally conducted political and professional studies, and 180,000 teachers have also directly participated in amateur primary school teacher refresher schools and correspondence teacher training schools, which has laid the foundation for the implementation of the new teaching plan starting in the fall. From this semester, primary schools across the country will also develop extracurricular activities for primary school students in a guided manner, and add manual labor classes, which will guide children to better use their spare time to consolidate and enrich classroom knowledge.

Various social extracurricular education organizations and institutions are constantly increasing and improving. The ranks of tens of millions of Young Pioneers are rapidly growing. They lead the vast number of children to study hard, help each other, participate in public welfare labor, and help their mothers with housework at home. These good behaviors have been praised by adults. In order to cultivate the healthy growth of the new generation, the state is starting to establish cultural centers, libraries, children's homes, science stations, children's palaces, children's "experimental workshops," etc. for children in some cities and counties under the existing conditions. From January to August this year, the number of new books published by the Children's Publishing House exceeded the total number of various types of new books published in the entire year last year. However, according to feedback from various sources, there is still a phenomenon of "extreme shortage" of children's reading materials. This shows the rapid growth of the cultural needs of the vast number of children today. Here, we ask writers, teachers, and parents to write more and better reading materials for children with all the good feelings and experiences they have in building a new life.

The achievements of the motherland in all aspects of socialist construction, the care and education for children, and the influence of new morality in society have enabled our new generation to move forward vigorously with confidence. Loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, cherishing public property, as well as honesty, bravery, unity and fraternity, have become the universally recognized excellent qualities of the vast number of children. In a nursery, we can see three-year-old children helping their companions comb their hair and button their buttons. At home, a kindergarten child will remind his mother to close the tap tightly. A first-year student who has just stepped into the school gate knows to hand over what others have lost on the road to the teacher or the police station. Children in various places also collect scrap copper and iron, pick up grain to report ore, collect tree seeds, afforest, plant oil crops, and mobilize families to sell surplus grain to the state. For example, the students of Guanmen Street Primary School in Xining City, Qinghai Province, collected 515 kilograms of scrap copper for the motherland, which can be used to make more than 8,000 zhang of electric wires; nearly 10,000 children in Chongqing planted more than 31,000 trees during the tree planting season; more than 11,000 children in Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, participated in wheat picking and picked up more than 94,200 jin of wheat; the Michurin group of Jiaokou Township Primary School in Yuqian County, Zhejiang Province, cultivated sunflower seeds with grains twice as large as usual.

At the national children's music performances held in twenty-four large and medium-sized cities this year, at the Sino-Soviet children's painting exhibition, at the national children's science and technology and craft works exhibition, and at the children's sports meets in many provinces and cities, we have fully seen the growth of our children in all aspects of physical, intellectual, moral, and aesthetic development in socialist construction; the vast number of children have also been inspired and encouraged to learn science and art from observing the performances and works of their peers. In particular, the excellent paintings of Soviet children not only gave new encouragement to Chinese children in painting techniques, but also enabled all children and adult visitors to learn more about the happy lives of Soviet children and people through painting, and further enhanced the deep friendship between the people and children of China and the Soviet Union. All the above performances and creations clearly show how heroic the children's young minds are! For the future, they hold beautiful ideals. They want to develop the underground treasures of the motherland, to manufacture the machines needed for agricultural electrification, they are thinking about how to use atomic energy to generate electricity, and how to train to become peaceful warriors to defend the motherland in the future.

From this hardworking, brave, patriotic, and ideal-rich new generation, we have seen the achievements of the motherland's construction in the past year, and also seen the progress in children's work. However, a flourishing orchard depends on the cultivation of the gardener, and the healthy growth of children depends even more on the patient education of adults. Today, the remnants of the old society and the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie will directly or indirectly affect children in many ways, and the broad masses of people still lack scientific knowledge of raising children. Therefore, we, as parents and all adults, in addition to working hard in our respective positions, jointly completing and overfulfilling the first five-year plan, and jointly creating better conditions for children's happy lives, must also strive to learn the knowledge and methods of raising children, and educate children with socialist ideological viewpoints. Only in this way can the excellent qualities that have already sprouted in children today be developed and consolidated through the correct cultivation of families, schools, and society, so that they can grow into active builders and defenders of the communist cause.

    祖国建设中的儿童
    中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会秘书长  康克清
    今天是我们伟大的祖国成立六周年的纪念日，全国各地的人民都欢天喜地庆祝着这个节日。首都天安门前，少年儿童们的美丽行列又将和数十万人民的巨大队伍欢呼着进入广场。游行队伍显示了中国人民建设祖国保卫祖国力量的不断增长，鼓舞着我们以更大的热忱去完成来年的新任务。今年，全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。这个计划的实现，将为全国人民和我们子孙万代的幸福奠定坚实的基础。
    这一年来，在社会主义的光辉照耀下，我们正以史无前例的规模和速度改变着祖国的面貌。全国人民的生活有了显著的变化，儿童受到国家和父母们更多的关怀和爱护。保卫儿童的工作从各方面开展起来了。父母们已逐渐认识到过去沿用打骂、哄骗、吓唬或娇宠孩子的办法是有害的，而积极地学习着正确教养子女的新方法。例如今年“六一”前后，各机关、学校、团体、城乡妇女基层组织所进行的关于儿童家庭教育的宣传，受到了群众的普遍欢迎。北京市一位老婆婆听见街道报告员要讲怎样教养儿童时，连忙对报告员说，“请等一等，让我叫儿媳妇也来听。”过去多少年来损害儿童健康的封建、迷信习俗正在逐渐消除。在城市和乡村中，大多数的妇女已采用科学的新法接生，从而保障了产妇和婴儿的生命和健康，逐渐解除着封建迷信加于母亲和儿童的禁条戒规所产生的痛苦。预防疾病的注射接种和科学的育儿知识已被越来越多的群众所接受。遇到孩子有病时，过去那种求神拜佛、烧香叫魂等办法，已由广大地区的卫生保健人员们辛勤劳动所代替。
    随着国家社会主义工业化和农村大规模合作化运动的开展，越来越多的妇女参加了社会劳动。为使广大劳动人民的子女在父母参加生产、工作时受到较好的教养，多种多样的托儿组织和幼儿园迅速发展起来。全国为工矿、企业、学校、机关的女职工设立的托儿所已有四千多所（没有参加工会组织的机关、部队和农村托儿所、幼儿园尚未统计在内）。自从提倡开办小型的日间托儿组织以来，不少机关已开始筹划或正在开办日间幼儿园。各种适合群众不同需要而为群众自办的街道托儿站和农忙抱娃娃互助组更不断地推广着。例如今年在六十多个城市开办的街道托儿站比去年就增加了百分之六十一。为了提高托儿所、幼儿园的工作质量，除了各单位组织保教人员的学习外，今年各城市比往年更多地举办了保教人员的业务讲习会或训练班。北京和天津还成立了幼儿教育研究室。
    在第一个五年计划中间，我们为普通教育和师范教育而支出的经费占国家五年计划总支出的百分之五点五四。今年国家预算中“教育支出”一项的数字比国民党反动政府统治时期教育支出预算最高年份一九四六年多二十八倍。各地小学校都扩大了招生名额，民办小学也得到了鼓励，这将使更多的儿童得到入学的机会。过去祖祖辈辈都是文盲的许多工农子弟和少数民族儿童今天有机会和其他儿童一起参加学习。目前，我们政府为使儿童在学校中受到全面发展的教育，在提高教育质量上，一年来，全国各地的小学教师普遍进行了政治、业务学习，其中有十八万教师还直接参加了小学教师业余进修学校和函授师范学校学习，这为秋季开始执行新的教学计划打下了基础。全国各地小学校从这学期开始并将有领导地开展小学生的课外活动，增设手工劳动课，这将引导儿童更好地利用课余时间来巩固和丰富课堂知识。
    社会上各种校外教育组织和机构正在不断地增加和改善。上千万的小红领巾队伍正在迅速壮大。他们带领着广大儿童努力学习，互相帮助，参加公益劳动，在家帮助妈妈做家务，这些良好的行为受到了成人的赞许。国家为培养新一代的健全成长，在现有条件下，正开始在一些城市中和县里为儿童设立了文化馆、图书馆、少年之家、科学站、少年宫、儿童“实验工场”等。少年儿童出版社今年一月到八月出版的新书种数超过了去年全年出版新书的各种种类的总数。但是根据各方面的反映，目前还是发生儿童读物“奇缺”的现象。这说明了今天广大儿童文化需要的迅速增长。我们在这里要求作家们、教师们、父母们，以他们自己在建设新生活中一切美好的感受和体会，为儿童写出更多更好的读物。
    在社会主义建设中祖国各方面的成就和对儿童的关怀教育，以及社会上新道德的影响，使我们的新一代满怀信心地蓬蓬勃勃地向前迈进。爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物，以及诚实勇敢团结友爱等已成为广大儿童所公认的优良品德。在一个托儿所里，我们可以看到三岁的孩子帮助同伴梳头，扣钮扣。在家里，一个幼儿园的孩子会提醒妈妈关紧水龙头。刚刚踏入学校大门的一年级学生在路上拣到别人遗失的东西，知道交给教师或派出所。各地的儿童还搜集破铜烂铁、拣粮报矿、采集树种、造林、种植油料作物，动员家庭把余粮卖给国家。如青海省西宁市观门街小学的学生，为祖国收集了可以用来做八千多丈电线的五百十五斤废铜；如重庆市近一万名儿童在植树季节种了三万一千余棵树；陕西省临潼县有一万一千多个儿童参加拾麦，拾了九万四千二百多斤麦子；浙江省于潜县交口乡小学的米丘林小组，培育了颗粒比平常大一倍的葵花子。
    在今年先后举办的全国二十四个大中城市的少年儿童音乐表演会上，在中苏少年儿童图画展览会上，在全国少年儿童科学技术和工艺作品展览会上，以及许多省市的儿童体育运动大会上，我们更充分地看到我国儿童在社会主义建设中体、智、德、美各方面的成长；广大儿童从观摩自己同伴的表演和作品中也得到了学习科学艺术的启发和鼓舞。尤其是苏联儿童的优秀绘画，不仅使我国儿童在绘画技术上得到了新的鼓舞，也使所有的儿童和成年的参观者通过绘画更多地了解苏联儿童和人民的幸福生活，更增进了中苏两国人民和儿童的深厚友谊。以上的各种表演和创作，都令人鲜明地感到在儿童们的幼小心灵上是洋溢着怎样豪迈的气概！对于未来，他们抱着美丽的理想，他们想着要去开发祖国的地下宝藏，要制造农业电气化所需要的机器，他们想着如何利用原子能来发电，如何锻炼着准备将来做一个保卫祖国的和平战士。
    从这些勤劳勇敢、热爱祖国、富有理想的新的一代，我们看到了祖国这一年来建设的成就，也看到了儿童工作上的进步。但是，花朵繁茂的果园，要靠园丁的培植，儿童的健全成长，更要靠成人的耐心教育。今天，旧社会的遗毒、资产阶级的腐朽思想在许多方面还会直接间接地影响儿童，广大群众还缺乏教养儿童的科学知识，因此，我们做父母的和一切成年人，除在各自的岗位上努力工作，共同为完成和超额完成第一个五年计划，共同为儿童的幸福生活创造更好的条件外，还要努力学习教养儿童的知识和办法，以社会主义的思想观点去教育儿童。只有这样，才能使今天在儿童身上已经萌芽的优良品德，经过家庭、学校和社会的正确培养而得到发展和巩固，使他们成长为共产主义事业的积极的建设者和保卫者。
