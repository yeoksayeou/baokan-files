　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 19th -- Lao news: The General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Units issued an order on October 17 to its subordinate units in Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces to implement the ceasefire agreement signed in Rangoon by both sides of Laos, effective October 21.

　　The order stated that Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces were originally assembly areas for the Lao Fighting Units, but the Royal Government, disregarding the provisions of the Geneva Accords, repeatedly invaded and occupied many strongholds in the two provinces. On March 9th of this year, the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Fighting Units signed an agreement to cease all hostile actions. However, this agreement was not implemented, and the areas of Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces, the assembly areas of the Lao Fighting Units, that were invaded continued to expand. These actions have exposed the conspiracy of American imperialism to prevent the Lao Fighting Units from unifying into the national common life of the Lao Kingdom.

　　The order stated: On October 11th of this year, Khou Ket, the representative of the Lao Royal Government, and Prince Souphanouvong, the representative of the Lao Fighting Units, signed an agreement on the cessation of all hostile actions within the two provinces. The agreement stipulates that ten days after signing, i.e., October 21st, both sides will completely cease all hostile actions.

　　The General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Units orders all cadres and fighters of the main forces, local forces, and militia guerrillas in Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces: 1. To thoroughly implement the ceasefire agreement in all battlefields within the two provinces, starting from zero hour on October 21st; 2. To constantly heighten vigilance to guard against all conspiracies to provoke and sabotage the ceasefire agreement.

　　The General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Units also calls on all cadres and fighters to strengthen unity, strictly observe discipline, cherish and assist the people, in order to consolidate peace, achieve unification, freedom, and democracy, and complete the independence of the nation.

    寮国战斗部队总司令部
    命令全军执行停止敌对行动的协议
    新华社河内十九日电　老挝消息：寮国战斗部队总司令部在十月十七日命令在丰沙里和桑怒两省的所属部队从十月二十一日起执行老挝双方在仰光签订的停止敌对行动的协议。
    命令说，桑怒和丰沙里两省原来是寮国战斗部队的集结区，但是王国政府不顾日内瓦协议的规定屡次侵犯和占领两省的许多据点。在今年三月九日，老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方曾签订停止一切敌对行动的协议。但是这个协议没有得到执行，寮国战斗部队集结区桑怒和丰沙里两省被侵犯的地区日益扩大。这些行动已经暴露出美帝国主义阻止寮国战斗部队统一到老挝王国的国家共同生活里去的阴谋。
    命令说：今年十月十一日，老挝王国政府的代表克特首相和寮国战斗部队的代表苏发努冯亲王就停止两省内的一切敌对行动签订了协议。协议规定签字后十天，即十月二十一日，双方将完全停止一切敌对行动。
    寮国战斗部队总司令部命令丰沙里和桑怒两省内的主力部队、地方部队和民兵游击队的全体干部和战士：一、从十月二十一日零时起在两省内各战场上彻底执行停止敌对行动的协议；二、不断地提高警惕提防挑衅和破坏停止敌对行动协议的一切阴谋。
    寮国战斗部队总司令部还号召全体干部和战士加强团结、严守纪律、爱护和帮助人民，以巩固和平、实现统一、自由、民主和完成民族的独立。
