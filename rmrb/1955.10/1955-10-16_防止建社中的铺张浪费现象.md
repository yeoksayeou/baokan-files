To the Editor:

Before autumn, a number of new agricultural production cooperatives were established in various counties of the Xiangtan Special District in Hunan Province. Some of these cooperatives engaged in extravagance and waste when celebrating their establishment. For example, two new cooperatives in Qixin Township, Wushan District, Wangcheng County, spent more than 20 yuan on a one-night opera performance on August 24th when the cooperatives were established. More than 600 farmers from the surrounding area came to watch the opera, which seriously affected the work of rushing to harvest and plant crops. The Xietian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xietang Township, Cifeng District, You County, spent two jiao per household and one jin of rice from each of the 21 cooperative member households to put on an opera for one night on September 8th to celebrate the establishment of the cooperative. Under the leadership of the township's Party and Communist Youth League branches, an old cooperative and twelve mutual aid teams in the surrounding area each sent a silk banner as a gift. The Dapitang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gaoqiao Township, Baiyun District, Xiangtan County, was established on August 26th. Each of the 17 cooperative member households contributed six jiao and two jin of rice. On that day, the cooperative hosted five tables of food to treat people who came to offer gifts and congratulations. In the afternoon, they hired a troupe to perform three acts of Huaguxi opera. The surrounding masses abandoned production work to watch the opera. Of the 21 newly established cooperatives in Huashi District, 16 put on operas, consuming a total of 245 jin of rice and spending 42 yuan.

The reason for this extravagance and waste is mainly that some of the personnel in charge of establishing the cooperatives like to show off and do not care about the hardships of the masses. For example, the opera performance celebrating the establishment of the cooperative in Qixin Township, Wangcheng County, was presided over by Wang Renrui, a member of the district committee. Although the district and county leaders raised objections after discovering this, he still insisted on his erroneous ideas.

After the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, the members and the broad masses of farmers are certainly very excited. Under the condition of not affecting the current production, it is very meaningful to hold a small celebration meeting, invite nearby mutual aid teams and some individual farmers to participate, and have the staff of the cooperative talk about the establishment process and the ideological transformation of the members, so as to publicize the specific policies of cooperativization and expand the influence of the establishment of the cooperative. However, the celebration meeting must be simple and unadorned, and should never be extravagant and wasteful. Especially when agricultural production cooperatives have just been established, they urgently need a large amount of production funds. If these funds are used for non-production purposes, it will not only directly affect the production and consolidation of the cooperative, but also cause difficulties in the lives of the members and harm their enthusiasm for taking the road of cooperativization. For example, Gong Changsheng, a poor peasant member of the Dapitang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiangtan County, dared not even attend the meeting because he could not afford the assessment for the celebration meeting.

In the future, a large number of agricultural production cooperatives will be newly established in various localities. It is hoped that the county and district Party committees will strengthen the education of relevant personnel and rural branches on "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily," criticize the tendency of some personnel responsible for establishing cooperatives to love extravagance and waste, and educate them to care about the lives of the masses and conscientiously build and manage agricultural production cooperatives well.

### 防止建社中的铺张浪费现象

    防止建社中的铺张浪费现象编辑同志：
    湖南省湘潭专区各县秋前新建了一批农业生产合作社，其中有一部分社在庆祝社的成立时发生了铺张浪费的现象。如望城县乌山区齐新乡新建的两个社，在八月二十四日社建成时，用了二十多元钱演戏一晚，周围六百多个农民赶来看戏，因而严重影响了抢收抢种工作。攸县慈峰区协塘乡协田农业生产合作社，在九月八日庆祝社建成时，二十一户社员每户派了二角钱和一斤米，唱了一晚戏；在乡的党、团支部带头下，乡里的一个老社和周围十二个互助组都各送锦旗一面。湘潭县白云区高桥乡大皮塘农业生产合作社在八月二十六日建成，十七户社员每户出六角钱和二斤米，当天社里办了五桌饭，请送礼祝贺的人吃了一餐，下午又请了剧团唱了三出花鼓戏，周围群众都丢掉生产不搞来看戏。花石区二十一个新建社，有十六个社唱了戏，共吃了米二百四十五斤，用了四十二元钱。
    造成这种铺张浪费现象的原因，主要是某些领导建社的工作人员好讲排场，不关心群众疾苦。如望城县齐新乡演戏庆祝建社，就是由区委委员王仁瑞主持的；虽然区、县领导同志发觉后提出了意见，但是他仍然坚持自己的错误主张。
    农业生产合作社建成以后，社员和广大农民内心当然十分兴奋。在不影响当前生产的情况下，开个小型的庆祝会，吸收附近的互助组和部分单干农民参加，由社里的工作人员谈谈建社经过和社员思想转变情况，借以宣传合作化的具体政策，扩大建社影响，这是很有意义的。但是庆祝会必须简单朴素，决不应该铺张浪费。尤其在农业生产合作社刚建成的时候，迫切需要大量生产资金，如果把这些资金用到非生产方面去了，不但会直接影响到社里的生产和社的巩固；而且还会使社员生活发生困难，伤害了他们走合作化道路的积极性。像湘潭县大皮塘农业生产合作社贫农社员龚长生就因为出不起庆祝会的派款而连会也不敢参加了。
    今后各地将新建大批农业生产合作社，希望县、区党委对有关工作人员和农村支部加强“勤俭办社”的教育，批判某些负责建社的工作人员爱铺张浪费的思想作风，教育他们关心群众生活，兢兢业业地把农业生产合作社建好、办好。
