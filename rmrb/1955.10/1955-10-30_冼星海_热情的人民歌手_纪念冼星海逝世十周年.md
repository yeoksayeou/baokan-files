    Xian Xinghai—An Enthusiastic People's Singer
    —In Commemoration of the Tenth Anniversary of Xian Xinghai's Death
  　Ma Ke
    People often call their favorite composers their own singers, which makes a lot of sense. Such composers transform the common love, hate, and beautiful ideals for future life in people's hearts into songs, which accompany them forever in joyful and hard-fought days, inspiring them. Xian Xinghai was such a composer. Although he has been gone for a full decade, his songs have continued to inspire us intimately.

    Why has Xian Xinghai's music stood the test of time and displayed such powerful artistic appeal? What should we inherit from his works?

    First, Xian Xinghai's works profoundly reflect the revolutionary struggles of that time.

    Xian Xinghai wrote about five hundred songs, two symphonies, six large choral works, one opera, and dozens of orchestral and solo pieces in his lifetime (actually, from his return from France in 1935 to participate in the national salvation work until his death in Moscow in 1945, the main period of his creative activity was only a short ten years). Most of these works reflect real life. His vocal works, whether large choruses, marches, or lyrical songs, can all be said to reflect the most acute revolutionary struggles of the time and the most significant events in people's lives. Like Nie Er, Xian Xinghai enthusiastically threw himself into the anti-Japanese national salvation movement of the time, stood at the forefront of the struggle, and contributed all his strength to serve national liberation. His works have a strong fighting spirit and political nature. Important events in our national life during those years can be found reflected in his songs. For example, on the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, we heard his call "Guns to the outside, advance in unison"; as soon as the Anti-Japanese War began, he loudly sang "Where do the enemies come from, drive them back to where they came from"; he sang about the guerrillas in the Taihang Mountains, responding to the Party's call: "Go to the enemy's rear"; after he arrived in the liberated areas, he used passionate and moving music to depict the production and construction and tense combat life of the army and people in the liberated areas... People heard the pulse of the entire era from his songs and were infected with tremendous fighting power. Instrumental works are generally considered the most difficult to connect with real life, but Xian Xinghai did not see it that way. His "Chinese Rhapsody" describes the beautiful mountains and rivers of the motherland, the hardworking people, and the longing for the motherland (he wrote this work while in the Soviet Union). His "National Liberation Symphony" depicts the road of the Chinese nation's struggle for freedom and liberation over the past century with an epic brush and foreshadows the future of New China. Not long after the German fascists attacked the Soviet Union, he met with Comrade Dimitrov at the headquarters of the Communist International. Comrade Dimitrov suggested that he write some works dedicated to the Red Army and Stalin. Soon, he wrote the "Sacred War Symphony," with the theme of reflecting the Soviet people's war to defend their motherland, with an irrepressible indignant mood... From his works, it seems that there is nothing that cannot be expressed through music. For him, music seems to be an even more important tool than language for expressing his thoughts and feelings.

    These things seem self-evident today, but at that time, or rather in the years when Xian Xinghai studied music, the traditional view was not like this. Past musical aesthetics believed that music could only vaguely depict certain inner mental activities of people. Music could not reflect real life, nor could it be accepted by the broad masses of people. Therefore, in the past, musicians who had received professional training were also instilled with the aestheticism of "art for art's sake." However, in a historical era when the national crisis was deepening, the people's demands for struggle were unprecedentedly high, and the working class and its party—the Communist Party—had already stepped onto the political stage to lead the people in their liberation struggle, that kind of decadent aesthetic thought seemed so out of place with the living reality. Therefore, some musicians with patriotism and democratic ideas began to break through backward artistic prejudices and use music to reflect real life. Therefore, these works all have a certain realistic tendency, but at the same time, they are limited by their worldview and creative methods. Therefore, their works cannot more profoundly reflect reality and have an impact on the broad masses. Only Nie Er inherited the realistic tradition in the development of our national music and pioneered the path of socialist realism in Chinese music. After Nie Er, Xian Xinghai further consolidated and developed Nie Er's cause with his richer creations.

    Like Nie Er, Xian Xinghai does not "objectively" reflect the struggle in reality in his works, but specifically reflects the real struggle by standing on the position of the working class and expressing the laboring people as the main body. If the image of the Chinese working class was reflected for the first time in Nie Er's musical works (such as "The Road Song" and "Pioneer of the Road"), then in Xian Xinghai's works, this theme was continued and developed from more aspects with a broader expressive technique. In his works, we see the rich and diverse spiritual outlook of the Chinese working and peasant masses. Like the heaviness and perseverance of "Plowing Song," the tenacity and optimism of "Ting Ying Sheung," the grandeur and heroism of "We Open the Road" and "March of the Manchurian Prisoners," and the diligent, brave, strong, confident, and robust spirit and fighting spirit carefully portrayed in the "Yellow River Cantata"... Such intimate, real, and vivid musical images of the laboring people cannot be found in past works. Nie Er and Xian Xinghai first showed a characteristic of socialist realism music in this regard.

    Secondly, Xian Xinghai does not passively reflect reality in his works, but actively uses the spirit of communism to educate and improve the people's thoughts and struggles. How do we understand the communist spirit in musical images? Needless to say, this cannot be explained solely by lyrics or musical titles. I believe that the main thing is that the composer grasps the most essential things of this era, creates typical musical images that represent the direction of historical progress, and promotes people to advance on the revolutionary road in accordance with the spirit of the Party's policies. We know that Xian Xinghai did not solve this problem from the beginning. His works in France were still influenced by Impressionism, and his early works after returning to China were not all successful. Many songs still have undue melancholy, and some songs' methods of expression are also relatively superficial. However, when he accepted an advanced worldview, especially after studying Marxism in Yan'an, as he himself said, "I actually discovered that many problems in music that could not be solved in the past were answered in the theory of social science." This greatly improved his creative thinking. His major works were all written after arriving in Yan'an, which was by no means accidental. Take the "Yellow River Cantata" as an example, which can be used as the best explanation. The creation of this work was precisely when the War of Resistance entered a stalemate, precisely at the critical moment of the Chinese nation's survival. Whether we can win and what path we should take to achieve victory is the most important issue in the lives of every Chinese person. Some people are blindly optimistic, thinking that victory will easily fall from the sky, while others are pessimistic and lose confidence. Only the anti-Japanese national united front led by the Communist Party of China and the policy of protracted war are the only correct way out. Comrade Mao Zedong's book "On Protracted War" specifically solved this problem politically and strategically. Inspired by the spirit of the Party's policies, Xian Xinghai created many beautiful images that summarized our national spirit in the immortal work "Yellow River Cantata," depicting the magnificent rivers and mountains of the motherland, the hardworking and brave people, and the people's inevitable victory in the struggle. It enhanced people's national self-esteem, strengthened their belief in victory, and unfolded a magnificent prospect before us. The reality summarized by the musical images of this work is so profound that we are deeply moved every time we hear it for the past ten years, without feeling that it has become a historical relic.

    A characteristic of Xian Xinghai's works is their profound popular character. This is reflected on the one hand in the fact that all his works use simple and easy-to-understand musical language, pursuing the most easily understood forms of expression for the masses; on the other hand, it is also reflected in the fact that he pays great attention to the ideological and artistic nature of his works, and pays great attention to the educational role of artistic works for the people. His works are full of the melodies of people's lives, and he is also proficient in using and refining the people's musical language. Therefore, his works truly achieve both elegance and popularity, and can be understood by women and children. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, whether in large cities or remote rural areas, his songs were spread everywhere, producing tremendous social effects. His major choral works can be sung by mass choirs with only a little basic knowledge. However, his works are by no means like those vulgar street ballads. Xian Xinghai's works are easy to understand on the one hand, and rich and profound on the other, having a long life among the people. Xian Xinghai's creative practice broke the past erroneous view of opposing the artistic and easy-to-understand nature of works. According to this view, it seems that the more profound the music is, the more difficult it is for the masses to accept it. The so-called "highbrow music with few listeners," many people judge the technical and artistic level of a work by how difficult it is to sing, play, and understand. However, this is precisely the formalist aesthetic viewpoint. According to the creative principles of realism, composers should pursue what can touch the heartstrings of most people and adopt forms that most people can understand. Naturally, it cannot be said that all works that are popular among the masses are good works, but good works must be understood by the broad masses. Xian Xinghai's works have left a brilliant example in this regard.

    The popular character in Xian Xinghai's works has a profound ideological foundation. This is to acknowledge that art is created by the people, and that art should belong to the people, serve the people, and educate the people. As Stalin said: "Art belongs to the people. It must take deep root in the broad masses of working people. It must be understood and loved by these masses. It must combine the feelings, thoughts, and will of the working masses and elevate them." (Stalin's conversation with Clara Zetkin) This view already had sprouts in Xian Xinghai's early thoughts (because his impoverished family and arduous life experiences gave him an instinctive sympathy for the laboring people). After he accepted revolutionary ideas, his works achieved a high degree of popular character and ideological content.

    Xian Xinghai's achievements in the national style of his works are also worth learning from. Naturally, when we say the national style of his works here, we are not only referring to where he quoted folk song themes or where he adopted Chinese modes or pentatonic scales. These are far from the entire content of the national style. The national style of Xian Xinghai's works is first determined by the expression of our nation's temperament and character. Xian Xinghai was a very enthusiastic patriot. He never mentioned his motherland without being full of pride and excitement. He sincerely loved the history, mountains, rivers, and cultural relics of the motherland, and loved the hardworking and brave people. This kind of emotion for the motherland cannot but be expressed in his music. The music of "Ode to the Yellow River" evokes images of famous mountains and great rivers on the northern highlands and plains, with thousands of scenes, and the thousands of people who have lived and gathered here for thousands of years, transforming the mountains and rivers so beautifully. This kind of robust temperament and sense of pride is precisely a common psychological state formed by the Chinese people in long-term common social life. We feel close to "Ode to the Yellow River" primarily because it expresses this common psychological state.

    Xian Xinghai often skillfully used landscape painting techniques in his works to express the characteristics of various places and natural environments in our country. For example, "Coming in February" and "March in Jiangnan" depict the beautiful scenery of Jiangnan; "September 18th Cantata" describes the undulating grasslands of Northeast China; "Production Cantata" describes the scenery of northern Shaanxi, and so on. This kind of description of the natural environment of the motherland, which is integrated into the expression of characters and struggles, also increases the listeners' sense of intimacy and enhances the national style of the work.

    The national style of Xian Xinghai's works is also reflected in the handling of the motherland's language. His early works were lacking in this regard (because he did not speak Mandarin well), but through his efforts, in his later works such as "On the Taihang Mountains," "Guerrilla Army," "Children of the Motherland," and several large-scale vocal works, the handling of language reached a delicate level, making people feel that the Chinese language is a beautiful and musical language.

    The national form of Xian Xinghai's works expresses the specific content of national life and expresses the characteristics of national style. He drew various melodies, musical phrases, and expressive methods from our country's rich national musical heritage, while at the same time never refusing to learn from advanced world musical culture. As a result, a new style is formed in his works, which is first of all national, but at the same time is interconnected with the world's musical culture. It has close ties with traditional music, but at the same time appropriately reflects new life. Xian Xinghai's music is elevated and developed new national music.

    Xian Xinghai has left us a rich legacy, and our research on him is very insufficient. Today, commemorating the tenth anniversary of his death, we must better learn from him, inherit his fine traditions, and work harder for the musical cause of our people.

    冼星海——热情的人民歌手
    ——纪念冼星海逝世十周年
  　马可
    人们常把他们喜爱的作曲家称为自己的歌手，这是很有道理的。这样的作曲家把人们心里共同的爱、恨和对未来生活的美好理想变成了歌声，这歌声在欢乐的和坚苦战斗的日子里永远陪伴着他们，鼓舞着他们。冼星海就是这样的作曲家。虽然他离开我们已经整整十年了，但是他的歌曲一直是亲切地鼓舞着我们。
    为什么冼星海的音乐经得住时间的考验，表现出了这样强大的艺术魅力？我们要从他的作品中继承哪些东西呢？
    首先，冼星海的作品深刻地反映了当时的革命斗争。
    冼星海一生（实际上从他一九三五年自法国回来参加救亡工作到一九四五年病逝在莫斯科，主要的创作活动时期不过短短的十年）写了大约五百首歌曲、两部交响乐、六部大合唱、一部歌剧和几十首管弦乐曲及独奏曲，这些作品大部分都是反映现实生活的。他的声乐作品，不论是大合唱、进行曲或抒情歌曲，可以说全部是反映当时最尖锐的革命斗争，反映人民生活中最重大的事件。和聂耳一样，冼星海热情地投身于当时的抗日救亡运动，站在斗争行列的前面，贡献自己一切力量为民族解放服务。他的作品带有强烈的战斗性和政治性，那些年代里我们民族生活中的重要事件都可在他的歌曲中找到反映。例如在抗战前夕我们听到他“枪口对外，齐步前进”的呼声；抗日战争一开始，他就响亮地唱出“敌人从哪里来，把他打回哪里去”；他歌唱太行山上的游击队，响应着党的号召：“到敌人后方去”；他到了解放区后，以激情的、动人的音乐描画了解放区军民的生产建设和紧张的战斗生活……人们从他的歌曲中听到整个时代脉搏的跳动，并且从中感染到巨大的战斗力量。器乐作品，一般人认为是最难与现实生活发生联系的，可是在冼星海看来却不然。他的“中国狂想曲”描写祖国美丽的山河、勤劳的人民以及对于祖国的怀念（写这作品时他在苏联）。他的“民族解放交响乐”以史诗般的笔触写出中华民族百年来争取自由解放的道路并预示了新中国的远景。德国法西斯进攻苏联以后不久，他曾到共产国际总部会见季米特洛夫同志，季米特洛夫同志建议他写些作品献给红军和斯大林，不久他就以按捺不住的激愤心情写了以反映苏联人民保卫祖国战争为主题的“神圣之战交响乐”……从他的作品看来，好像是没有什么东西不能够用音乐来表现的、对他来说，似乎音乐是比语言还重要的表达自己思想情感的工具。
    这些在今天看起来好像都是理所当然的了，但是在当时，或者说在冼星海学习音乐的年代，传统的观点却不是这样。过去的音乐美学认为音乐只能模糊地描写人们内在的某种心灵活动，音乐是不能反映现实生活的，也不可能为广大人民所接受。所以在过去一般受过专业训练的音乐家们同时也被灌输着“为艺术而艺术”的唯美主义思想。但是，在民族危机日益深重，人民的斗争要求空前高涨，并且工人阶级及其政党——共产党已经登上了政治舞台领导着人民进行解放斗争的历史时代，那种颓废的美学思想与活生生的现实是显得那样不相称，所以一些有着爱国主义和民主思想的音乐家们开始冲破落后的艺术偏见而用音乐去反映现实生活，因此他们的这些作品都带有一定的现实主义倾向，但同时又受他们的世界观和创作方法的局限，因此他们的作品还不能更深刻地反映现实和在广大群众中发生影响。只有聂耳，继承了我们民族音乐发展中的现实主义传统，在我国音乐上开辟了社会主义现实主义的道路。冼星海在聂耳之后，以他更丰富的创作进一步巩固了并且发展了聂耳的事业。
    和聂耳一样，冼星海不是在他的作品中“客观”地反映现实中的斗争，而是站在工人阶级的立场以表现劳动人民为主体这样具体地反映现实斗争。如果说中国工人阶级的形象第一次在聂耳的音乐作品中反映了出来（如“大路歌”、“开路先锋”），那末在冼星海的作品中以更广博的表现手法从更多的方面继续发展了这个主题。我们在他的作品中看到了中国工农群众丰富多样的精神面貌。像“拉犁歌”那样的沉重坚忍，“顶硬上”那样的顽强乐观，“路是我们开”、“满洲囚徒进行曲”那样的雄伟豪迈，以及像在“黄河大合唱”中所精心刻划的那种勤劳、勇敢、坚强、自信的浑厚气魄和战斗精神……这样一些亲切、真实、历历在目的劳动人民的音乐形象是在过去的作品中找不到的，聂耳和冼星海首先在这方面表现出了社会主义现实主义音乐的一个特征。
    其次，冼星海在他的作品中不是消极地反映现实，而是积极地用共产主义的精神教育着提高着人民的思想和斗争。我们怎样来理解音乐形象中的共产主义精神呢？不消说，这是不能仅靠歌词或乐曲标题来作诠释的。我以为，主要的是作曲家把握住这一时代的最本质的事物，创造出代表历史前进方向的典型的音乐形象，依照党的政策精神，推动人们在革命的道路上前进。我们知道冼星海并不是一开始就解决了这个问题的。他在法国时的作品还受着印象派的影响，回国以后初期的作品也并不是每首都成功的，有不少的歌曲还带有不应有的沉郁，有些歌曲的表现方法也是比较表面化的。但是当他接受了先进的世界观，尤其是到了延安经过了对马克思主义的学习以后，诚如他自己所讲的“竟发现了音乐上许多的问题过去不能解决的，在社会科学的理论上竟得到了解答。”这就大大提高了他的创作思想。他的几部主要作品都是到延安以后写出，那绝不是偶然的。以“黄河大合唱”为例，可作一个最好的说明。这个作品的产生正在抗战进入相持阶段，正是中华民族生死存亡的关头。我们能不能战胜，通过什么样的道路才能走向胜利，这是每一个中国人生活中最重要的问题。有些人盲目乐观，以为胜利会轻易的从天而降，有些人悲观失望，丧失了自信。只有中国共产党领导的抗日民族统一战线和持久抗战的政策才是唯一正确的出路。毛泽东同志“论持久战”一书在政治上和战略思想上具体解决了这个问题。冼星海在党的政策精神的鼓舞下，在“黄河大合唱”这部不朽的作品中创造了概括我们民族精神的许多优美的形象，描绘了祖国壮丽的河山，勤劳勇敢的人民和人民必胜的斗争。它使人们提高了民族自尊心，增强了胜利的信念，并在我们面前展开一幅波涛壮阔的远景。这个作品的音乐形象所概括的现实是这样深切，以至十年来我们每次听它都不感到它已成为历史的陈迹而被深深激动。
    冼星海作品的特点是深厚的人民性。这一方面表现在他所有的作品都使用着平易、浅近的音乐语言，追求着最容易被群众所了解的表现形式；另一方面也表现在他十分注意作品的思想性和艺术性，十分注意艺术作品对人民的教育作用。他的作品中充满着人民生活的音调，他也熟练地使用着、提炼着人民的音乐语言，因此他的作品真正做到了雅俗共赏，妇孺能解。抗战期间不论是在大城市或穷乡僻壤到处都传遍了他的歌曲，产生了巨大的社会效果。他的几部大合唱只要是稍有基础的群众性合唱团也都能演唱。但是他的作品绝不像那些粗鄙的市井小调。冼星海的作品一方面是浅近易解的，一方面是丰富深刻的，在人民中间有着长久的生命。冼星海的创作实践打破了过去把作品的艺术性和易解性对立起来的错误看法，按照这种看法仿佛越是高深的音乐越是难以为群众接受，所谓“曲高和寡”，不少人是以作品的难唱、难奏和难懂来判定其技术性和艺术性的高低的。然而这正是形式主义的美学观点。按照现实主义的创作原则，作曲家应该去追寻那最能打动大多数人的心弦的东西，并采用大多数人能够理解的形式。自然，不能说凡是在群众中流行的都是好作品，但是好的作品一定是为广大群众所理解的。冼星海的作品在这方面留下了光辉的榜样。
    冼星海作品中的人民性是有着深刻的思想基础的。这就是承认艺术是人民创造的，艺术应该属于人民，服务于人民，教育人民。正如斯大林所说：“艺术属于人民。它必须深深生根于广大的劳动群众中间。它必须为这些群众所理解，为他们所喜爱。它必须结合劳动群众的感情、思想和意志，把它们提高。”（斯大林与克拉拉·蔡特金的谈话）这种观点在冼星海早期的思想中已经有了萌芽（因为他贫困的家庭和劳苦的生活遭遇，使他对于劳动人民有一种本能的同情），当他接受了革命思想以后，他的作品便取得了高度的人民性和思想性。
    冼星海在作品的民族风格上所达到的成就也是值得我们学习的。自然，我们在这里说他作品的民族风格并不是只指他在那些地方引用了民歌主题，那些地方采用了中国的调式或五声音阶。这些远不是民族风格的全部内容。冼星海作品的民族风格首先决定于表现出了我们民族的气质和性格。冼星海是一个十分热情的爱国者，他没有一次提到自己的祖国不是充满着骄傲和激动的。他出自衷心地热爱祖国的历史、山河、文物，热爱勤劳勇敢的人民。对于祖国的这种情感不能不在他的音乐中表现出来。像“黄河颂”的音乐令人想起北方高地和平原上的名山大川，气象万千，而几千年来千千万万人民在这里生息养聚，将山河改造得如此美丽，这种浑厚的气质，这种自豪感正是我国人民在长期共同的社会生活中形成的一种共同的心理状态。我们听了“黄河颂”感到亲切，首先就是因为它表现出了这种共同的心理状态的缘故。
    冼星海在他的作品中常常善于使用画风景画一样的手法表现我国各种地方和自然环境的特点。例如“二月里来”“江南三月”描绘出江南的秀丽风光；“九一八大合唱”中描写东北起伏的大草原；“生产大合唱”中描写陕北风光等等。这种融会在表现人物表现斗争中的对于祖国自然环境的描写，也都增加了听者的亲切感，增强了作品的民族风格。
    冼星海作品的民族风格还表现在对于祖国语言的处理上。他早期的作品在这方面还有不够的地方（因为他的普通话讲不好），但经过了他的努力，在他以后的作品如“在太行山上”、“游击军”、“祖国的孩子们”及几部大型声乐曲中对语言的处理达到了精妙的地步，使人觉得中国语言是一种美丽的、富有音乐性的语言。
    冼星海作品的民族形式表现了民族生活的特定内容，表现了民族的风格特点。他从我国丰富的民族音乐遗产中吸取各种音调、乐汇和表现方法，同时又绝不拒绝借鉴先进的世界音乐文化。因之在他的作品中形成一种新的风格，它首先是民族的，但同时又是与世界音乐文化相贯通的。它与传统的音乐有着密切的联系，但同时又恰如其分地反映着新的生活。冼星海的音乐是提高了和发展了的民族新音乐。
    冼星海给我们留下了丰富的遗产，我们对他的研究是很不够的。今天纪念他逝世十周年，我们一定要更好地学习他，继承他的优良传统，更好地为我国人民的音乐事业努力工作。
