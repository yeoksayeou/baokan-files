    Dangerous Steps by the Iranian Government
    Not long ago, the Iranian government declared that it was not prepared to participate in any military bloc "initiated by Western countries." But now it has abandoned this position. On October 11, Iranian Prime Minister Hossein Ala announced at a meeting of the Iranian Senate Foreign Affairs Committee that his government had decided to join the Turkish-Iraqi-Pakistani military alliance, the so-called Baghdad Pact.
    This serious decision by the Iranian government was made under pressure from the United States. It is known that because Iran is located between Turkey and Pakistan, which have already joined the US military bloc, the United States has been carrying out a series of diplomatic blackmail attempts against Iran since the creation of the Baghdad Pact, attempting to expand this military alliance as a branch of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc and connect it with the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. US officials have repeatedly expressed their "hope" that Iran would join this treaty "in order to establish a solid 'defense' chain along the southern edge of Russia." Recently, the United States also instructed Turkish President Bayar to "visit" Tehran to win them over. Precisely after Bayar left Tehran, Iran announced its participation in the Baghdad Pact, which makes it easy to see what force made the Iranian authorities so self-contradictory.
    The Iranian government has tried its best to argue that its participation in the Baghdad Pact is in line with Iran's "security needs" and that the treaty is not aimed at the Soviet Union or any other country. This argument is completely hypocritical. The Baghdad Pact is a bridge between the North Atlantic aggressive bloc and the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and it is a military aggression treaty directed against the Soviet Union and China. This is already a well-known fact. The Associated Press stated that the United States considers Iran "a Western military asset," its strategic significance being that Iran "can provide access to Russia's Baku oil fields, Tashkent's heavy industrial area, and the industrial area of Soviet Central Asia beyond the Urals." The "New York Times" on October 2 was even more blatant, saying that if the United States could establish a "strong defense" in the Zagros Mountains between Iraq and Iran, it could "expose the Soviet Union to devastating air attacks." Isn't the role that the United States is trying to get Iran to play perfectly clear?
    In principle, the Iranian authorities should resolutely implement a policy of peace and independence to safeguard their country's sovereignty and security. However, the Iranian government has chosen the wrong path. This path will turn Iranian territory into a military base for Western countries, Iranian resources will be controlled by foreign capital, and more seriously, Iran may be dragged into a risky military gamble. It is quite obvious that Iran's participation in the Baghdad Pact will greatly damage Iran's national interests. This is contrary to the wishes of the vast majority of the Iranian people.
    Iran's decision to join the Baghdad Pact cannot but affect the security of the Middle East and its relations with other countries. It is known that most countries in the Middle East oppose the Baghdad Pact planned and established by Western powers. Iran's participation in this military alliance will only deepen the divisions in the Middle East and isolate itself in the Middle East.
    It is particularly important to point out that this measure by Iran will seriously affect relations between Iran and the Soviet Union. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union and Iran have more than 2,400 kilometers of common border. After the founding of the Soviet Union, it abolished the unequal treaties signed by the Tsarist government with Iran, handed over to Iran a large amount of materials and wealth that Russia possessed in Iran, and consistently implemented a good-neighborly policy towards Iran. In recent years, the Soviet Union has made many efforts to improve relations between the Soviet Union and Iran. The Soviet and Iranian governments resolved border and financial issues, which greatly helped strengthen the friendship between the two countries. According to the 1927 Soviet-Iranian Treaty on Guaranteeing Neutrality, Iran has guaranteed not participate in any political alliance agreement directed against the Soviet. The Iranian government should not evade this solemn international obligation.
    Iran is a participant in the Bandung Conference. The conference's declaration on promoting world peace and cooperation advocates that countries live together as peaceful neighbors and develop friendly cooperation. The declaration specifically stipulates "not to use collective defense arrangements to serve the particular interests of any major power." The Asian-African Conference, whose achievements are due to the concerted efforts of twenty-nine countries, is having a major impact and role throughout the world. Asian and African countries should further promote the spirit of the conference and promote international cooperation on the basis of the great achievements of the Asian-African Conference.
    Now, Iran has signed the Asian-African Conference Communiqué, but it has joined this military bloc directed against the Soviet Union and China. This is obviously not in line with the spirit and principles of the Asian-African Conference, which cannot but cause great regret.

### 伊朗政府的危险步骤

    伊朗政府的危险步骤
    不久以前，伊朗政府曾经声明过，它不准备参加“西方国家发起”的任何军事集团。可是现在它竟放弃了这种立场。十月十一日，伊朗首相侯塞尼·阿拉在伊朗议会上院外交委员会会议上宣布，他的政府已经决定参加土耳其—伊拉克—巴基斯坦军事联盟，即所谓巴格达条约。
    伊朗政府这个严重的决定，是在美国的压力之下做出来的。人们知道，由于伊朗介于已经参加美国军事集团的土耳其和巴基斯坦之间，美国自从制造了巴格达条约以后，就对伊朗进行了一系列的外交讹诈，企图扩大这个军事联盟，以作为北大西洋侵略集团的分支，并同东南亚侵略集团联结起来。美国官员们多次表示“希望”伊朗参加这个条约，“以便沿着俄国南部边缘建立一条巩固的‘防御’锁链”。最近，美国又指使土耳其总统拜亚尔“访问”德黑兰，进行拉拢。恰恰在拜亚尔离开德黑兰之后，伊朗就宣布参加巴格达条约，这就不难看出究竟是什么力量使伊朗当局这样自相矛盾。
    伊朗政府竭力辩解说，它参加巴格达条约符合伊朗“安全的需要”，并且说这个条约不是针对苏联或任何国家的。这种论调是十足虚伪的。巴格达条约是北大西洋侵略集团和东南亚侵略集团之间的桥梁，它是一个针对着苏联和中国的军事侵略条约。这已是人们都知道的事情。美联社就说过，美国认为伊朗是“西方的一笔军用财产”，它的战略意义在于，从伊朗“可以通往俄国的巴库油田、塔什干的重工业区和越过乌拉尔在苏维埃中亚细亚的工业区”。“纽约时报”在十月二日更露骨地说，如果美国能在伊拉克与伊朗间的雅格罗斯山脉建立“有力的防御”，就可以“使苏联暴露在摧毁性的空中攻击之下”。美国企图叫伊朗扮演的角色，不是十分明白的吗？
    按理说，伊朗当政者应该坚决实行和平与独立的政策，以维护本国的主权和安全。然而，伊朗政府却选择了错误的道路。这条道路将使伊朗的领土变为西方国家的军事基地，伊朗的资源遭受外国资本的控制，更严重的是伊朗有可能被拖进一场冒险的军事赌博中去。十分明显，伊朗的参加巴格达条约，将使伊朗的民族利益遭到极大的损害。这是和伊朗广大人民的愿望相违背的。
    伊朗决定参加巴格达条约，不能不影响到中近东的安全，影响到它和其他国家的关系。人们知道，中近东多数国家都反对由西方大国策划建立起来的巴格达条约。伊朗参加这一军事同盟，只能加深中近东的分裂，使自己在中近东趋于孤立。
    特别需要指出，伊朗的这一措施，将严重地影响到伊朗和苏联的关系。大家知道，苏伊两国有着二千四百多公里的共同疆界。苏联建国以后，就废除了沙皇政府同伊朗缔订的不平等条约，把俄国在伊朗拥有的大量物资财富交给了伊朗，并始终不渝地对伊朗实行善邻政策。近年来，为了改善苏伊之间的关系，苏联更作了许多的努力。苏联政府和伊朗政府解决了疆界问题和财政问题，大大有助于两国之间友谊的加强。根据一九二七年的苏伊关于保证中立的条约，伊朗已保证不参加任何针对苏联的政治联盟或协定。这个庄严的国际义务，伊朗政府是不应规避的。
    伊朗是万隆会议的参加国。会议关于促进世界和平和合作的宣言主张各国作为和睦的邻邦和平相处、并发展友好合作。宣言特别规定“不使用集体防御的安排来为任何一个大国的特殊利益服务”。由于二十九国通力合作而取得成就的亚非会议正在全世界发生重大的影响和作用。亚非国家应该在亚非会议的巨大成就的基础上进一步推广会议的精神，促进国际合作。
    现在，伊朗在亚非会议公报上签了字之后，却参加这种针对苏联和中国的军事集团。这显然不符合亚非会议的精神和原则，这不能不令人感到很大的遗憾。
