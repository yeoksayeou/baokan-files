    Guaranteeing the Implementation of the Geneva Accords in Cambodia
    Recently, the International Commission for Cambodia submitted a report on the military aid agreement signed between the United States and Cambodia on May 16th of this year. The International Commission clearly pointed out in its report that many clauses of the US-Cambodia agreement are inconsistent with the provisions of the Geneva Accords.
    The signing of the US-Cambodia agreement is a serious step by the United States to undermine the Geneva Accords. This agreement seriously violates the provisions of the Geneva Accords prohibiting Cambodia from entering into military alliances with foreign countries, providing military bases to foreign countries, or receiving military assistance from foreign countries. It seriously threatens Cambodia's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and neutral status, and further exacerbates international tensions in the Far East. Therefore, since its signing, this agreement has been strongly opposed by the Cambodian people and all peace-loving countries and people who are concerned about maintaining the Geneva Accords. After reviewing the contents of the US-Cambodia agreement, the International Commission for Cambodia solemnly pointed out to the Royal Government of Cambodia many aspects of this agreement that are inconsistent with the Geneva Accords. This is the correct measure taken by the International Commission. In this situation, the Royal Government of Cambodia assured the International Commission that all clauses in the US-Cambodia agreement that violate the Geneva Accords would be invalid.
    After the Cambodian elections on September 11, Prince Sihanouk personally took charge of the government. He reaffirmed Cambodia's determination to pursue a neutral policy, not to allow any country to establish military bases in Cambodia, not to sign military treaties with any country, and not to allow any country to use Cambodia as a military transit station. People also remember that when Prince Sihanouk led the delegation of the Royal Government of Cambodia to visit India and participate in the Asian-African Conference in March and April this year, he repeatedly stated that Cambodia accepts the principles of peaceful coexistence, will not turn Cambodia into a base for aggression, and will adhere to neutrality. Therefore, there is reason to demand that the Royal Government of Cambodia, under the personal leadership of Prince Sihanouk, abide by its own guarantees regarding the US-Cambodia agreement and contribute to the implementation of the Geneva Accords and the maintenance of Cambodia's neutral status.
    The International Commission for Cambodia, chaired by the Indian representative, has made great efforts in maintaining the implementation of the Geneva Accords, which is particularly commendable. In the future, in order to guarantee the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Cambodia and prevent any foreign country from entering into military alliances with Cambodia in any way, establishing military bases in Cambodia, or providing Cambodia with military assistance not permitted by the Geneva Accords, the International Commission still needs to strictly supervise. The International Commission has pointed out that the Royal Government of Cambodia must faithfully fulfill its guarantees regarding the US-Cambodia agreement and give full cooperation when the International Commission conducts supervision in this regard. All further efforts made by the International Commission in the future to ensure that the Geneva Accords are faithfully implemented in Cambodia will certainly continue to receive the full support of all peace-loving countries and people who are concerned about maintaining the Geneva Accords.

### 保证日内瓦协议在柬埔寨的实施

    保证日内瓦协议在柬埔寨的实施
    最近，柬埔寨国际委员会就今年五月十六日美国和柬埔寨签订军事援助协定的问题提出了报告。国际委员会在报告中明确指出，美柬协定的许多条款同日内瓦协议的规定不符。
    美柬协定的签订是美国破坏日内瓦协议的一个严重步骤。这个协定严重违反了日内瓦协议关于禁止柬埔寨同外国订立军事同盟、向外国提供军事基地或自外国接受军事援助的规定。它严重地威胁着柬埔寨的主权、独立、领土完整和中立地位，进一步加剧了远东的国际紧张局势。因此，这个协定自签订以来，就遭到柬埔寨人民和一切爱好和平、关心维护日内瓦协议的国家和人民的强烈反对。柬埔寨国际委员会在审查了美柬协定的内容后，向柬埔寨王国政府严正指出了这个协定中许多不符合于日内瓦协议之处。这是国际委员会所采取的正确的措施。在这种情况下，柬埔寨王国政府向国际委员会保证美柬协定中所有违反日内瓦协议的条款都将是无效的。
    九月十一日柬埔寨选举后，西哈努克王子亲自执政。他重申柬埔寨决心奉行中立政策，不许任何国家在柬埔寨建立军事基地，不同任何国家签订军事条约，也不让任何国家把柬埔寨作为军事转运站。人们也都记得，西哈努克王子今年三、四月间率领柬埔寨王国政府代表团访问印度和参加亚非会议时，也曾一再表示柬埔寨接受和平共处的各项原则，不将柬埔寨变为侵略基地，并将坚守中立。因此，人们有理由要求，在西哈努克王子所亲自领导下的柬埔寨王国政府，将遵守它自己关于美柬协定所作出的保证，为贯彻日内瓦的协议和维护柬埔寨的中立地位，作出贡献。
    以印度代表为主席的柬埔寨国际委员会，在维护日内瓦协议的实施方面，作了很大的努力，这是特别值得称道的。今后为保证日内瓦协议在柬埔寨的实施，防止任何外国以任何方式同柬埔寨订立军事同盟，在柬埔寨建立军事基地，或向柬埔寨提供日内瓦协议所不允许的军事援助，还需要国际委员会严格进行监督。国际委员会已经指出，柬埔寨王国政府必须忠实履行它关于美柬协定的各项保证，并在国际委员会就此进行监督时给予充分的合作。国际委员会今后为使日内瓦协议得以在柬埔寨被忠实实施而作的一切进一步的努力，都一定会继续得到所有爱好和平和关心维护日内瓦协议的国家和人民的全力支持。
