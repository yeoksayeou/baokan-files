Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 30th. In the months of September and October, 205 private factories in Shanghai have been transformed into joint state-private enterprises. To date, of the 270 private factories in Shanghai approved by the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee to become joint state-private enterprises this year, all but forty or so, which have not yet completed the preparations for joint operation, have become joint state-private factories. A large number of new joint state-private factories are now preparing their first annual plans. Some factories have begun to reform their management organizations and systems, and some heavy industrial factories are preparing to establish democratic management committees. Most of the factories that have merged for joint operation have already merged production, and most of the factories that needed to relocate machinery and equipment have completed the relocation. New leading bodies, such as the state-owned Shanghai Wool and Flax Textile Company, have also been established in industries such as wool spinning and flax spinning to uniformly lead the state-owned and joint state-private factories in these industries.

Of the eight industries in Shanghai that are undergoing full industry joint state-private ownership this year, the cotton spinning, flax spinning, enamelware, flour milling, and rice milling industries completed full industry joint operation in September and October. The wool spinning, paper making, and cigarette industries will complete full industry joint operation in November. In the process of full industry joint operation, these industries have undergone repeated consultations, comprehensive planning, and rational reorganization between the public and private parties; the irrational state caused by the blind development of capitalism has been initially changed, and the needs of national construction have been met. For example, fifteen small rice mills used the surplus factory buildings and equipment of the flour milling industry to merge into two large joint state-private rice milling factories, which not only changed the situation of annual losses in the flour milling industry due to overcapacity, but also enabled the rice mills to get rid of their decentralized and backward state and meet the requirements of processing. The twenty-three private enamelware factories have now been reorganized into fifteen joint state-private factories, making the factories that were originally incompletely equipped into all-round factories.

The seventy-nine private heavy industrial factories that underwent joint operation in September and October, mostly small in scale and with backward equipment, and whose products could not meet the needs of national construction, have been merged and reorganized into many factories specializing in the manufacture of boilers, ships, auto parts, and telecommunications equipment. These new joint state-private specialized factories, with concentrated equipment and technical forces, are already formulating plans to trial-produce a large number of new products next year.

    上海二百多私营工厂公私合营
    新华社上海三十日电　九、十两个月中，上海市有二百零五家私营工厂实行公私合营。到目前为止，上海市人民委员会批准在今年实行公私合营的二百七十家私营工厂中，除四十多家还没有完全结束合营的筹备工作外，其余都已成为公私合营工厂。现在大批新的公私合营厂正在第一次编制年度计划，有的厂已开始改革管理机构和制度，部分重工业厂准备建立民主管理委员会。合并合营的厂绝大部分已合并生产，需要迁移机器设备的工厂大部分也已迁移完毕。毛纺、麻纺等行业还成立了国营上海毛麻纺织公司等新的领导机构，统一领导这些行业中的国营和公私合营工厂。
    今年上海市全业实行公私合营的八个行业中，棉纺、麻纺、搪瓷、面粉、碾米五个行业已在九、十月内完成全业合营，毛纺、造纸、卷烟三个行业将在十一月份完成全业合营。这些行业在全业合营的过程中，经过公私双方反复协商，全面规划，合理改组；初步改变了资本主义盲目发展所造成的不合理状态，适应了国家建设的需要。如碾米业十五家小厂利用面粉业多余的厂房和设备，合并成两个大型的公私合营碾米工厂，既改变了面粉业因生产能力过剩而历年亏损的局面，也使碾米厂摆脱分散落后状态，适应加工的要求。搪瓷业二十三个私营厂现在改组成十五个公私合营工厂，使原来设备不全的厂变成为全能厂。
    九、十月份合营的七十九家私营重工业工厂；因大多规模小、设备落后，产品不能符合国家建设需要，已合并改组成为许多专门制造锅炉、船舶、汽车配件、电讯器材的工厂。这些新的公私合营专业工厂，拥有集中的设备和技术力量，已在制定明年度大批试制新产品的计划。
