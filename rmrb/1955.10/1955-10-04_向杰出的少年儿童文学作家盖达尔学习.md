    Learning from the Outstanding Children's Literature Writer Gaidar
    He Yi
    The Soviet Union is the first country to offer children the most progressive and best juvenile literature works. In the Soviet Union, among the list of outstanding juvenile literature writers, there is a most glorious name, that of A. Gaidar.

    In peaceful times, he wholeheartedly wrote excellent works for children; in times of war, he bravely defended the motherland and the children, even to the point of shedding his last drop of blood. His tombstone is inscribed with the last sentence of his work "Chuk and Gek": "One should live gloriously, work hard, love and protect this vast and happy land called the Soviet Union." This is a most accurate epitaph, and his glorious life is worthy of it.

    Gaidar was a writer with a thorough Marxist-Leninist worldview and a high degree of Party spirit. He completed the task of educating children with communist ideology very well in his works. With powerful literary weapons and an abundance of optimism, Gaidar promoted communist ethics and morals—collectivism, love of labor, Soviet patriotism, and the lofty ideals of fighting for socialism.

    Gaidar published his first novella for children in 1926—"The Revolutionary Military Council," which portrayed the theme of the domestic war and how children participated in the civil war. In "The Revolutionary Military Council," there was no erroneous tendency of child pioneerism as shown in many children's literature works at that time. What appeared was the true image of ordinary Soviet children. What the protagonists Kimka and Tsigan do in the novel is actually what every child can do if they are willing and determined. They hid the wounded commander, rescued him, and sent his note to the nearby Red Army troops. Under the influence of adults—Communists—they established their first, still childlike, feats. This novel became the cornerstone of Soviet children's novellas.

    Gaidar is always true to the reality of life when depicting children. The feats accomplished by Gaidar's little protagonists are always commensurate with their age and abilities. They participate in the socialist struggle together with adults. They learn, live, and struggle under the guidance of adults, and gradually grow up. In his novels, Communists, just like life itself, are friends and mentors to young people. Their vivid and profound images also occupy an important position in the works. For example, in his novel "School," there are Chupuk, Ivanovich, Commissar Shebalov, the Czech Gerda, and Boris's father. In "Far Away Lands," there is the collective farm chairman Schegol and the retired armored vehicle driver Old Ivan. The most obvious example is in "Smoke in the Forest," where a twelve-year-old boy, Vlotka, gets lost in the forest and accidentally encounters the crashed airplane pilot, Fedoseyev. The pilot is injured and unable to move, and the fire set by special agents crossing the border is spreading towards this side. The author does not let Vlotka perform earth-shattering feats in the novel—carrying the pilot out of the forest, or walking out of that vast forest very smoothly (though very tragically) to report to the border guards. On the contrary, if the pilot had not pointed the way for him, Vlotka would never have reached the observation post to report the location of the disaster and the news about the special agents crossing the border. Moreover, he was not even the first to report the important discovery, because he himself ran out of strength halfway while swimming across the river. When people were searching for him, the police dog followed his tracks to the pilot, and then followed his tracks to the river and rescued him from the river. In this work, Gaidar neither portrayed the child as a delicate "flower" who cannot withstand any small setbacks, nor did he exaggerate him into an invincible legendary little hero. He portrayed the spiritual outlook of a Soviet child, which is both extremely ordinary and very heroic. The image of such a little hero is completely real.

    Gaidar's achievements in children's literature creation demonstrate the victory of socialist realism creation methods in this art form of children's literature. In all his works, Gaidar inextricably links his little protagonists with the life of the country. He is good at vividly and accurately bringing out the feeling of the times, the feeling of all the big and small changes in life. The characters of the children are formed under the influence of the great Soviet reality.

    This is fully expressed in his autobiographical novel "School." This is a book describing the cultivation of the character of Soviet people. In this book, Gaidar talks to young people about serious political and ethical issues, and lets readers see how the young protagonist Grekov gropes his way to the road of history and life. Grekov overcomes many great difficulties and pays a great price to cultivate his character as a Soviet new man. The life and character of this protagonist are described as being closely connected with the history and national life of that time. Gaidar joined the Red Army at the age of fourteen, participated in the civil war, and later served as a Red Army regimental commander. Based on his personal experience as a socialist fighter, he wrote various works for children.

    His creative themes are very broad. The themes he chooses are always closely related to the theme of socialist struggle. His works include the theme of defending the Soviet motherland, the theme of socialist industrial construction, the theme of collective farm construction, and the theme of cultivating the character of Soviet children. However, no matter which theme he deals with, his works always delve into the deepest parts of the lives of the Soviet people and children. He never depicts children in isolation. The children in his works live among the Soviet people. By depicting Soviet children, he also depicts the Soviet people.

    Gaidar paid special attention to the theme of raising vigilance, defending the socialist motherland, and protecting it from internal and external enemies. He has many famous novels, such as "Far Away Lands," "Smoke in the Forest," "The Fate of the Young Drummer," and "Military Secrets," which all belong to this category. Even in his most lighthearted works, he always hints at the Soviet people's vigilance and the importance of defending the socialist motherland. In the joyfully atmosphere "Blue Cup," narrating the Red Army's learning; in the peaceful and tranquil "Chuk and Gek," describing children watching armored trains from the carriages and the commanders beside it ready to fight at any time. Building socialism under capitalist encirclement, defense work is extremely important, Gaidar constantly reminds children not to forget the existence of enemy encirclement. The domestic war is over, but the struggle is not over, the only difference is that it has taken a more complex form. Gaidar expressed his love for the socialist motherland and his high vigilance against the enemy in his works.

    Tirelessly studying, arming one's mind with Marxist-Leninist thought, infinite loyalty to the socialist motherland and firm faith in the revolutionary cause, adhering to the correct viewpoint and standpoint and the artistic principles of socialist realism in the practice of children's literature creation, closely linking one's works with the current socialist struggle—important political tasks and central movements, and enhancing the combat effectiveness and ideological content of the works, this is what our Chinese writers, especially children's literature writers, should learn from Gaidar first and foremost.

    Gaidar, who loves the motherland and the socialist cause, must also love children. This is a very important point for a writer who takes "working for children" as his vocation. Gaidar has devoted all his efforts throughout his life to contributing everything to children. The history of his life can testify to this noble emotion. Gaidar's feelings for children are not just the kindness and concern of an ordinary elder for the younger generation. This is a highly politically conscious soldier who realizes his serious responsibility for the socialist cause, and thus regards the solemn task of educating and cultivating socialist new people as being closely related to the entire great cause of the proletariat, and dedicates all his energy and efforts to the younger generation.

    Only writers who love children can truly understand children.

    Gaidar's understanding of children is manifested in his familiarity with children's emotions, children's psychology, children's lives, and children's language. This is the basic reason why he can vividly portray the image of children.

    The image of Timur created by Gaidar is the most real image of a positive child character. Gaidar saw all the advantages in Soviet children, concentrated these advantages in Timur, and made them figurative. Timur is a noble, kind, active and creative child. Timur embodies the excellent qualities of Soviet children—kindness, intelligence, wit, courage, love of labor, and love of the socialist motherland. Therefore, when children see this image, they regard him as a real hero and take him as an example to learn from. During the Great Patriotic War, a vibrant "Timur Movement" participated in by millions of children was born. The political and educational significance of this movement is inestimable.

    The creation of the image of Timur illustrates Gaidar's keen sense as a true Bolshevik of new things in the bud, and illustrates that as a children's literature writer, he can truly and deeply understand the children of the socialist motherland—their lives and their spiritual outlook.

    Gaidar showed full respect for children.

    After writing a piece of work, he would take it to the yard and read it to the children he knew to see if the children were interested. Then he would read it to his friends, and then take a bus to the Young Pioneer camp or orphanage to read it to unfamiliar children.

    Gaidar paid great attention to the interests of children readers. His works are always interesting, and the plot often has an adventurous nature, developing rapidly through the actions of the children. However, he never caters to readers, and he never pursues vulgar tastes like some writers do. The taste of his works is determined by life itself, not by the forced jokes added by the author.

    Gaidar's works are extraordinarily fascinating, but without vulgar tastes. Gaidar's works have very serious content, but they are not boring at all. This is because Gaidar can truly understand children. He understands what children love and what is beneficial to children.

    Gaidar adopts a very cautious attitude when educating children. He always carefully considers, using the best way and the most appropriate language, to convey his advice to children so that they can accept it willingly. From his works, we can see that he correctly treats children's shortcomings. He always points out the harm of these shortcomings to children with a sympathetic and sincere attitude. There is no blame, no contempt; no ridicule, no abuse.

    Sergei, the Young Pioneer drummer in "The Fate of the Young Drummer," was exploited by the enemy when his character weaknesses were revealed. Fortunately, he had developed a love for the socialist motherland since he was a child, and thanks to the influence of adults—Communists—he returned to the correct path in life. Bai Jiga in "Far Away Lands," due to an inadvertent mistake, took the compasses of the geological surveyors out of curiosity. Later, fearing that his mistake would be known to others, he painfully concealed the fact that the collective farm chairman he discovered had been assassinated by rich peasants for a while. In "Chuk and Gek," the two children hid the loss of the telegram from their mother. As a result, when they went to Siberia with their mother to visit their father for the New Year, they found that their father was already on a business trip, and they encountered many difficulties that could have been avoided. . . Gaidar pointed out to the children seriously, yet passionately: even the smallest dishonesty, accidental lies, and inadvertent small mistakes are beneficial to the enemy, making him feel isolated and feeling opposed to the collective. Even in a calm life, a person's faults and shortcomings often bring trouble and damage to themselves and others. Gaidar is good at using the facts themselves, rather than using boring maxims and lessons, to persuade children to face their shortcomings and mistakes squarely and fight against them tirelessly.

    Love children, work wholeheartedly to cultivate socialist new people, delve into children, deeply understand children, fully respect children, and raise the ideological and artistic quality of works to the highest level. This is also what our Chinese writers, especially children's literature writers, should learn from Gaidar.

    向杰出的少年儿童文学作家盖达尔学习
    贺宜
    苏联是第一个给孩子们献出最进步的最好的少年儿童文学作品的国家。在苏联，优秀的少年儿童文学作家名单中间，有一个最光辉的名字，就是阿·盖达尔。
    在和平的岁月里，他全心全意为孩子们写下出色的作品；在战争的时候，他英勇地保卫着祖国和孩子们，以至流出了他最后的一滴血。他的墓碑上写着他的作品“丘克和盖克”最后的一句话：“应该光荣地生活，多多工作，热爱和保护这片叫做苏联的广大而且幸福的土地。”这是一个最确切的墓志铭，他的光辉的一生足以当之而无愧。
    盖达尔是一个具有彻底的马克思列宁主义世界观和高度的党性的作家。他把以共产主义思想教育孩子的任务在自己的作品中完成得很出色。盖达尔以有力的文学武器和充沛的乐观主义精神，宣传着共产主义的伦理和道德——集体主义、热爱劳动，苏维埃爱国主义和为社会主义而斗争的崇高思想。
    盖达尔在一九二六年出版了第一本为儿童写的中篇小说——“革命军事委员会”，这是表现国内战争和儿童如何参加了内战这个主题的。在“革命军事委员会”里，没有当时许多儿童文学作品所表现出来的儿童先锋主义的错误倾向，出现的是苏联普通儿童的真实形象。主人公箕姆卡和齐刚在小说里所做的事，实际上是每一个儿童只要愿意做、决心做的话都能够做到的。他们把受伤的指挥官隐藏起来，救护他，把他的字条送到附近的红军部队里去，他们在成年人——共产党员的影响下建立了第一次的、还是孩子式的功绩。这本小说成了苏联中篇儿童小说的奠基作品。
    盖达尔在描写儿童时是永远忠实于生活的真实的。盖达尔的小主人公所完成的功绩永远同他们的年龄和能力相称。他们和成年人一道参加社会主义斗争。在成年人的指导下学习、生活、斗争，并逐渐成长起来。共产党员在他的小说里，正像生活本身一样，是少年儿童的朋友和导师。他们鲜明深刻的形象，一样在作品里占着重要地位。例如在他的小说“学校”里，有丘蒲克、伊凡诺维奇、政委谢巴洛夫、捷克人盖尔达和鲍里斯的父亲。在“远方”里，有集体农庄主席薛戈尔和退休的铁甲车司机老伊凡。最显明的例子是“林中烟”，十二岁的孩子伏洛特卡迷路在森林里，意外地遇到了失事的飞机驾驶员费陀谢叶夫。驾驶员已经受伤，不能行动，而侵越国境的特务放的大火正在向这一面蔓延过来。作者不让伏洛特卡在小说里干出惊天动地的伟业——把飞行员背出森林，或者很顺利（虽然很悲壮）地走出那茫茫无际的森林，去报告国境守备队员。相反，若不是飞行员为他指示了方向，伏洛特卡永远也到不了监视所，去报告肇祸地点和关于侵越国境的特务的消息。而且，他连第一个去报告重要发现的人都还不是，因为他自己在泅水过河的时候，中途脱力了。当人们找寻他的时候，警犬就沿着他的足迹找到了驾驶员，随后又沿着他的足迹，到河边把他从河里救了起来。盖达尔在这个作品里，既没有把孩子描写成为弱不禁风、不能受到任何一点小小挫折的“花朵”，也没有把他夸大为一个不可一世的传奇式的小英雄。他刻划了一个苏维埃儿童的精神面貌，既极平凡，又很有英雄气概。这样的小英雄的形象是完全真实的。
    盖达尔在儿童文学创作方面的成就，表明社会主义现实主义创作方法在儿童文学这一艺术形式中的胜利。盖达尔在他所有的作品中，都把自己的小主人公跟国家生活不可分割地联系在一起。他善于把对时代的感觉、把对生活中的一切大小变化的感觉，生动而准确地发挥出来。孩子们的性格都是在伟大的苏维埃现实生活的影响下形成的。
    这在他的自传性小说“学校”里充分表现出来。这是一本描写苏维埃人性格的培养的书。盖达尔在这本书里跟少年们谈到严肃的政治问题和伦理问题，并且让读者们看到这个少年主人公葛烈科夫怎样摸索到了历史和生活的道路。葛烈科夫克服了许多巨大困难，化了极大的代价来养成自己的苏维埃新人的性格，这个主人公的生活和性格，就是被描写成跟当时的历史和国家生活密切相连的。盖达尔十四岁就参加了红军，参加过内战，后来还当过红军团长。他根据自己的社会主义战士的亲身经验，为儿童写各种作品。
    他的创作主题非常广泛。他选择的题材总是跟社会主义斗争的主题紧密联系的。他的作品里有保卫苏维埃祖国的题材，有社会主义工业建设的题材，也有集体农庄建设的题材，也有培养苏维埃儿童性格的题材。但是，无论处理哪一种题材，他的作品总是深入到苏联人民和孩子们生活的最深处。他决不孤立地描写儿童。他的作品中的儿童是生活在苏联人民中间的，描写了苏联儿童，同时也就描写了苏联人民。
    盖达尔特别注意关于提高警惕，保卫社会主义祖国，使它不受内外敌人侵害的题材。他有好多本著名的小说，如“远方”、“林中烟”、“少年鼓手的命运”、“军事秘密”等，都是属于这一类的。即使在他最轻快的作品里，也随时暗示着苏联人民的警觉性和保卫社会主义祖国的重要。在充满着欢乐气氛的“蓝杯”里，叙述着红军的学习；在和平宁静的“丘克和盖克”里，描写孩子们从车厢里望见装甲列车和在它一旁随时准备战斗的指挥员。在资本主义包围下建设社会主义，保卫工作是极端重要的，盖达尔不断提醒儿童叫他们不要忘记敌人包围的存在。国内战争结束了，但斗争并没有结束，所不同的只是采取了更复杂的形式。盖达尔在作品里表现了对社会主义祖国的热爱和对敌人的高度警惕。
    不倦地学习，用马克思列宁主义思想来武装自己的头脑，对社会主义祖国的无限忠诚和对革命事业的坚定信心，在儿童文学创作实践中坚持正确的观点立场和社会主义现实主义的艺术法则，把自己的作品紧密地同当前社会主义斗争——重要的政治任务和中心运动联系在一起，提高作品的战斗性和思想性，这是我们中国作家，特别是儿童文学作家，首先要向盖达尔学习的。
    热爱祖国和社会主义事业的盖达尔，必然是热爱儿童的。对一个把“为儿童而工作”作为自己天职的作家来说，这是非常重要的一点。盖达尔一生努力以赴的就是为了儿童贡献出他的一切。他的生命的历史可以为他这个崇高的感情作证。盖达尔对于儿童的感情，不是一个普通的长者对年轻一代的慈祥和关切。这是一个具有高度政治觉悟的战士，意识到自己对于社会主义事业的严肃责任，从而把教育、培养社会主义新人的庄严任务看做同整个无产阶级伟大事业休戚相关，把全部精力和心血奉献给年轻一代。
    只有热爱儿童的作家，才能真正了解儿童。
    盖达尔对儿童的了解，表现在他熟悉儿童的感情、儿童的心理、儿童的生活和儿童的语言。这就是他能够唯妙唯肖地刻划儿童的形象的基本原因。
    盖达尔所创造的铁木儿的形象，是一个最真实的正面儿童人物的形象。盖达尔从苏联儿童身上看出一切优点，把这些优点集中在铁木儿的身上，并加以形象化。铁木儿是高尚善良的、积极而富有创造性的孩子。铁木儿体现了苏联儿童的优秀品质——善良、聪明、机智、勇敢、热爱劳动、热爱社会主义祖国。因此，孩子们一看到这个形象，就把他看作实际存在的英雄，把他当做学习的榜样。在伟大的卫国战争时期，产生了数百万儿童参加的生气勃勃的“铁木儿运动”，这种运动的政治意义和教育意义是难以估价的。
    铁木儿这一形象的创造，说明了盖达尔作为一个真正的布尔什维克对在萌芽中的新事物的锐敏感觉，说明了他作为一个儿童文学作家，能够真正深刻地了解社会主义祖国的儿童——他们的生活和他们的精神面貌。
    盖达尔对儿童表示了充分的尊重。
    他写好一篇东西，就拿到院子里去，念给熟识的小孩子听，看孩子们是不是感到兴趣。然后他念给朋友听，于是再乘车到少年先锋营或者孤儿之家去念给陌生的孩子们听。
    盖达尔非常注意儿童读者的兴趣。他的作品总是富有趣味的，故事情节多半带着惊险的性质，通过儿童的行动急速往前发展。然而，他决不曲意奉迎读者，他从来不追求庸俗的趣味，像有些作家那样。他的作品的趣味是由生活本身所决定，而不是作者硬加的插科打诨。
    盖达尔的作品异常引人入胜，但没有庸俗的趣味。盖达尔的作品内容非常严肃，但却毫不枯燥。这是因为盖达尔能够真正了解儿童。他懂得什么是儿童所喜爱的，什么是对儿童有益的。
    盖达尔对儿童进行教育采取非常审慎的态度，他永远认真地考虑着，用最好的方式和最恰当的语言，把他的忠告传达给孩子，使他们能够心悦诚服地接受它。从他的作品里，我们可以看出他正确地对待儿童的缺点，他总是满怀同情地用严肃诚恳的态度来给孩子们指出这些缺点的危害性。没有责备，也没有鄙薄；没有嘲弄，也没有谩骂。
    “少年鼓手的命运”里的少先队鼓手谢尔盖，当他性格上的弱点表现出来时，就被敌人利用，幸亏他从小就养成了对社会主义祖国的爱，同时由于成年人——共产党员们的影响，他才重新走上正确的生活道路。“远方”里的白季迦，由于一个不经意的过失，在好奇心的驱使下拿走了地质勘测队员们的罗盘，后来因为害怕自己的过失被别人知道，痛苦地把他发觉的集体农庄主席被富农暗害的事情隐瞒了一个时候。在“丘克和盖克”里，两个孩子对妈妈瞒过了丢失电报的事情，结果他们跟着妈妈到西伯利亚爸爸那儿去过新年的时候，发现爸爸已经出差了，他们遇到了许多本来可以避免的困难。……盖达尔严肃地，然而满腔热忱地向儿童们指出：即使是最细小的不诚实、偶然的撒谎和不经意的小过失，都是有利于敌人的，会使他陷于孤立，感到自己同集体对立起来。即使在风平浪静的生活里面，一个人的过失和缺点，也往往会给自己和别人带来一些麻烦和损害。盖达尔善于用事实本身，而不是用枯燥的格言和教训，来说服孩子们正视自己的缺点和错误，跟它们进行不松懈的斗争。
    热爱孩子，全心全意地为培养社会主义新人而工作，深入到儿童中去，深刻地了解儿童，充分地尊重儿童，把作品的思想性和艺术性提到最高的水平。这也是我们中国作家，特别是儿童文学作家应该向盖达尔学习的。
