The full text of the proposal is as follows:

Comrades, all employees of the national state-owned commercial system:

Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our great motherland is advancing towards socialism at a tremendous pace. The people of the whole country are actively contributing their strength to socialist construction. Employees of our state-owned commercial system bear an important responsibility in socialist construction. The specific work we do every day is extraordinary, important, and contributes to socialist construction. Every achievement we make is accelerating the speed at which our motherland transitions to socialism.

Now, we would like to propose the following conditions and work together with everyone to move forward:

(1) Love your job, study policies conscientiously, actively delve into your business, improve your policy and business level, correctly complete state plans, and better serve production and consumers.

(2) Cherish state property, oppose corruption and waste, reduce commodity losses, save circulation costs, and do a good job in commodity storage, hygiene, and display, reducing or avoiding errors and accidents.
