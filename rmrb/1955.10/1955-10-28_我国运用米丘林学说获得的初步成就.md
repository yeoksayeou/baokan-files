    Preliminary Achievements of China's Application of Michurin's Theory
    Liang Zheng Lan
    Michurin's theory, which was comprehensively introduced to China after liberation, has propelled China's biology and agricultural science into a new stage.
    In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party and the government and with the warm and selfless assistance of Soviet experts, agricultural bioscience workers across the country have extensively studied Michurin's theory, criticized bourgeois academic thought in conjunction with their own work, thereby leading China's agricultural bioscience onto a new path and achieving preliminary results.
    The principles and methods of Michurin's theory have played a significant role in China's mass seed selection. In old China, many agronomists, influenced by bourgeois thought, blindly worshipped foreign varieties and never paid attention to China's local improved varieties. Michurin once said: "The idea that everything best can only be obtained from abroad is shameful." At that time, many people held this idea. After liberation, under the guidance of Michurin's theory, mass seed selection movements were carried out in various regions. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1,300 excellent local varieties of various crops have now been selected. Among them, the "Flat-Ear Wheat" selected by Shandong labor model Yu Qingshou and his wife, the "Large-Grain Semi-Awn Wheat" bred by Zhong Weifang and his wife in Huang County, and the "Laolaiqing" japonica rice variety selected by Jiangsu labor model Chen Yongkang, have all been promoted on several hundred thousand to one million mu. These improved varieties have high-yielding characteristics and regional adaptability, and have played a huge role in increasing yield per unit area.
    In order to improve and maintain the viability of varieties, the advanced techniques of intra-varietal and inter-varietal hybridization, as well as distant hybridization with auxiliary pollination, created by Michurin's theory, have yielded preliminary results in China's research work. For example, the South China Agricultural College's intra-varietal hybridization experiment with seven rice varieties resulted in an average increase of 12.29 percent in grain weight, 16.31 percent in panicle weight, and 2.9 percent in stem length. The inter-varietal hybridization experiment using mixed pollen from four varieties, including "Huangzhan," increased production by 3.5 to 20.7 percent. The East China Agricultural Science Institute's intra-varietal hybridization experiment with four varieties, including "Maozitou," "Nantehao," "Shengli Xian," and "Zhongnong No. 4," resulted in a yield increase of 2.3 to 27.5 percent in the first generation. The Institute of Genetics and Cultivation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the North China Agricultural Science Institute used "S Cotton Er Bi" and "Mi Cotton 103-4" as rejuvenation targets, and used five upland cotton varieties, as well as *Gossypium arboreum*, *Hibiscus rosa-sinensis*, *Alcea rosea*, and *Acer palmatum* as male parents, respectively, to conduct intra-varietal and inter-varietal hybridization and distant hybridization with auxiliary pollination. All of these methods improved the viability of the offspring, making them stronger, earlier-maturing, and higher-yielding than naturally pollinated plants. The rejuvenation methods also revealed that multiple male parents are superior to a single male parent, early sowing of offspring is superior to late sowing, two pollinations are superior to one pollination, and emasculation is superior to non-emasculation.
    The use of auxiliary pollination methods for corn in various regions has also achieved high-yield results. Experiments in various regions have proven that emasculation and pollination can increase production by more than 5 percent in the same year, and using it as seed can increase production by 7 to 10 percent in the following year. This measure is being promoted. The yield-increasing effect of inter-varietal hybrid corn seeds has been confirmed. For example, "Fangza No. 2," one of the five hybrid seeds in Shandong Province, yielded an average increase of 40 to 60 percent compared to local varieties in trials conducted in seven locations, including Jiaozhou, Tai'an, and Laiyang, in 1952. Comparative results from 14 agricultural production cooperatives in Weifang in 1954 proved that the average yield increase was 70.7 percent, and other hybrid seeds had similar effects. Now, Shandong Province has promoted hybrid seeds on more than 10,000 mu and has conducted technical training. At present, about 300 agricultural production cooperatives in six special zones throughout the province have learned to produce hybrid seeds, generally achieving good results.
    Based on Michurin's theory of changing external conditions to improve crop viability, the Hebei Agricultural College conducted late-autumn sowing experiments with crops such as millet, broomcorn millet, sorghum, and corn. The experiments proved that viability was improved in all crops. Taking millet as an example, late-autumn sowing generally increased production by 20.5 percent compared to the control group, earing 13 to 15 days earlier, and reducing white-head disease and red-ear disease.
    Applying the principles and methods of spring wheat turning into winter wheat proposed by Academician Lysenko, the Northeast Agricultural Science Institute has achieved results in the research of changing spring wheat into winter wheat. The institute has successively obtained seven new types of spring wheat transformed into winter wheat, among which "Kehua" and "Kefeng" can overwinter in the local low temperature of minus 36 degrees Celsius. This work is still in progress.
    In addition, the Northwest Agricultural Science Institute, Yunnan University, and other institutions have preliminarily determined in their research on wheat tillering that measures such as more fertilizer and moisture, sparse planting, and transplantation play an important role in creating tillering types.
    After Michurin's theory was comprehensively introduced to China, various regions carried out a lot of asexual hybridization work. The East China Agricultural Science Institute used Sea Island cotton grafted onto Upland cotton "Dai Zi 14" for cultivation. The result was that budding and flowering were advanced by one month in the same year, and flowering could occur at the same time as "Dai Zi 14" in the following year, which was two months earlier than the flowering period of Sea Island cotton in the local area. After several generations of cultivation, fruit setting has become normal and early maturity has gradually stabilized. This work provides good data for long-staple cotton breeding. The institute's continuous cultivation and selection of hybrids of *G. barbadense* and *G. hirsutum* has now resulted in new early-maturing, long-staple types.
    The North China Agricultural Science Institute obtained asexual hybrids by grafting "White Eggplant" onto "Nine-Leaf Eggplant." In the grafting generation, variations occurred in fruit shape and color, and segregation occurred in the next generation, including previously unseen types. The experiment also determined that the timing and degree of variation varied depending on the grafting method. Using young bud grafting and double grafting methods made it easier to obtain asexual hybrids, and the degree of variation was also greater. In addition, the Zhejiang Agricultural College, South China Agricultural College, Beijing Agricultural University and other institutions have successively obtained asexual hybrids. These research results are very helpful in eliminating the remnants of the pseudo-science of the Mendel-Morgan school.
    Regarding the study of phasic development, preliminary achievements have also been made in wheat, cotton, rice, millet, and vegetables.
    The Institute of Genetics and Cultivation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the North China Agricultural Science Institute analyzed 168 representative wheat varieties from across the country in 1953. The results clearly showed that the more northern the variety, the stronger the winter growth; the more southern the variety, the stronger the spring growth. From the perspective of the light phase, two-thirds of the southern varieties were insensitive to light. The East China and Northwest Agricultural Science Institutes had similar research results. In terms of rice, according to the analysis of 21 varieties by the Institute of Plant Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the East China Agricultural Science Institute, vernalization can generally be carried out under conditions of 15 to 30 degrees Celsius, and the number of days does not exceed 12 days. Different varieties showed different performance. The Central South Agricultural Science Institute and the Southwest Agricultural Science Institute also obtained similar results. These experiments also pointed out that early-maturing varieties are insensitive to long-day light, while medium-maturing and late-maturing varieties are sensitive. In terms of cotton, the preliminary results of the analysis of 12 varieties by the Institute of Genetics and Cultivation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the North China Agricultural Science Institute were: the vernalization stage requires a temperature of 25 to 30 degrees Celsius, and each variety does not exceed 8 days, with early-maturing varieties being shorter and late-maturing varieties being longer. In terms of light, preliminary evidence confirmed that the development of each variety is fastest under 12 hours of short-day light, with short internodes and compact plant types, and the budding and flowering periods are earlier than under long-day light. The number of days advanced varied for each variety. The Jilin Agricultural Experiment Station clarified the vernalization conditions for Chinese cabbage and radish, and proved that flowering was advanced and the weight of 1,000 grains was increased after vernalization, providing useful information for seed collection. The Zhejiang Agricultural College's research on garlic preliminarily revealed that garlic bolting requires lower temperatures, while bulb formation requires longer light. The vernalization treatment method created by Academician Lysenko based on the theory of phasic development is also being tested in China. Taking large-scale vernalization of Upland cotton as an example, according to the joint experiment results of Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces over the past two years, the emergence period was early and uniform, flowering and boll opening were generally advanced by one to four days, and were concentrated, the amount of pre-frost cotton was increased by 3 to 15 percent, the total yield was increased by 3 to 13 percent, and the disease resistance during the seedling stage also showed an increasing trend. The experimental results in Northeast China, East China, Henan and other places are roughly the same. The agricultural authorities in Inner Mongolia and Northeast China have also preliminarily seen the trend of promoting development and increasing production in the vernalization of spring wheat, and South China in the vernalization of rice. The above-mentioned experimental results related to vernalization treatment are being used for demonstration and comparison, and are gradually being promoted.
    In addition, the specific application of the theory of phasic development in China's production has produced good results. For example, in April 1953, the above-ground parts of wheat in southern Shanxi were attacked and frozen to death by cold waves during the jointing stage. The frozen area in Wenxi County alone reached 600,000 mu. In April 1954, another serious frost damage occurred, affecting an area of 10.04 million mu, involving 54 counties. According to the old practice, when encountering this kind of frost damage, the wheat would be cut and plowed, and other crops would be planted, and no wheat would be harvested that year. However, after studying Michurin's theory, the Shanxi Rural Work Team of the North China Agricultural Science Institute determined that the frozen wheat plants could still re-ear and bear fruit based on the theory of phasic development. Therefore, with the support of the local Party and government leaders, it was decided to leave it unplowed and instead use topdressing irrigation and strengthen management methods. As a result, in 1953, a harvest of 100 to 150 jin per mu was obtained. Although the frost damage was more severe in 1954, more than 80 jin per mu were still harvested.
    Regarding animals, preliminary achievements have also been made under the guidance of Michurin's theory.
    The work of many stud farms and breeding stations in China has been improved. The main manifestations are the increase in the pregnancy rate of livestock and the decrease in the mortality rate of young animals. In livestock breeding, the growth of pigs has been accelerated due to the adoption of the Soviet economic crossbreeding method, and the weaning weight of piglets can reach 18 kilograms. Xinjiang Province used Caucasian fine-wool sheep and local Mongolian sheep and Kazakh sheep for crossbreeding, and bred a fine-wool sheep that is used for both meat and wool. The weight of rams is 166 jin, and the weight of ewes is 111 jin, which is 40 to 60 percent heavier than local sheep. The amount of wool sheared is 20.5 jin for rams and 14 jin for ewes, which is several times higher than local sheep. In recent years, under the guidance of Michurin's science, animal husbandry scientists in China are conducting improvement work on local varieties such as Huzhou sheep, Han sheep, Jinhua pigs, Bozhi pigs, and yellow cattle.
    Some experiments have also been carried out on asexual hybridization of animals. For example, teachers at Nanchang Normal School used goose egg white to replace chicken egg white to obtain hybrid chickens, which have characteristics similar to geese, such as a large head, long neck, wide abdomen, thick feet, large webs, and heavy body weight; and they have strong vitality, are cold-resistant, and grow fast. Under the same conditions, the control chickens increased by 4.7 cm per day, while the hybrid chickens increased by 6.3 cm. Sichuan University used eggs from Laihang chickens to exchange egg white with eggs from five breeds: Red Island, Lihua, Australian Black, Chengdu chickens and Beijing ducks, and the results showed that the weight of the hatched chicks increased and the survival rate was high. The school also mixed equal amounts of semen from several roosters for artificial insemination, resulting in an increased hatching rate.
    In terms of silkworms, Zhu Xi and others used mixed insemination of sperm from the same variety and different varieties, and found that the mother has a strong selectivity for sperm from different varieties. At the same time, it was proved that whether mixed insemination of sperm from the same variety or different varieties, the offspring have higher viability and greater resistance than those from single-parent insemination. This result is of great significance both theoretically and practically.
    Although what is mentioned above is only a part of the entire achievement, it is enough to illustrate that as long as China's agricultural biology community accepts the guidance of the advanced Michurin's theory, gets rid of the shackles of bourgeois academic viewpoints, and combines with the production practice of the working people, scientific research work will make great progress. Although only preliminary achievements have been made in the past six years, it marks a huge change in the history of biology and agronomy in China.
    Chinese scientists are well aware that the scientific legacy left by old China is very weak, and China's scientific level is still relatively backward. Although preliminary achievements have been made in the past six years, they are far from meeting the scientific requirements of the production cause.
    Our motherland is carrying out large-scale socialist construction. Socialist construction has put glorious and important tasks on the shoulders of agricultural, forestry, fishery and biology workers in our country. We must study more deeply and creatively apply the advanced Michurin's theory to complete our tasks.

    我国运用米丘林学说获得的初步成就
    梁正兰
    解放后全面地传到我国的米丘林学说，把我国的生物学和农业科学推进到了一个新的阶段。
    几年来，全国的农业生物科学工作者，在党和政府的领导下，在苏联专家热诚无私的帮助下，广泛地学习了米丘林学说，并结合自己的业务，批判了资产阶级的学术思想，从而使我国的农业生物科学走上新的道路，并取得初步成果。
    米丘林学说的原理和方法，在我国的群众性选种上发挥了很大的作用。旧中国的许多农学家，受了资产阶级思想的影响，一味崇拜外国品种，而对我国的农家良种从不过问。米丘林曾说：“认为一切最好的东西只能从外国得到的想法是可耻的。”当时许多人却正怀着这种想法。解放以后，在米丘林学说指导下，各地开展了群众性的选种运动。据不完全统计，现已选出各种作物的优良的地方品种达一千三百多种。其中山东劳动模范于青绶夫妇所选的“扁穗小麦”，黄县仲维芳夫妇选育的“大粒半芒麦”，江苏劳动模范陈永康所选的“老来青”粳稻品种，都已经推广了几十万亩到一百万亩。这些良种，都具有丰产特性和区域适应性，对提高单位面积产量发挥了巨大的作用。
    为了提高和保持品种的生活力，米丘林学说所创造的品种内、品种间杂交以及远缘辅助授粉等先进技术，在我国的研究工作中有了初步结果。例如华南农学院以七个水稻品种进行品种内杂交的结果，平均谷重增加百分之十二点二九，穗重增加百分之十六点三一，秆长增加百分之二点九。又以“黄占”等四品种的混合花粉进行品种间杂交，增产百分之三点五到百分之二十点七。华东农业科学研究所用“帽子头”“南特号”“胜利籼”“中农四号”四个品种进行品种内杂交结果，第一代增产百分之二点三到百分之二十七点五。中国科学院遗传栽培室和华北农业科学研究所曾以“斯字棉二比”“密字棉103—4”两品种为复壮对象，以五个陆地棉品种及中棉、木槿、蜀葵、槭葵等作父本，分别进行品种内、品种间杂交及远缘辅助授粉，均提高了子代生活力，比自然传粉者健壮，早熟，产量高。并在复壮方法中查明：多父本优于单父本，子代早播优于晚播，两次授粉优于一次授粉，去雄优于不去雄等。
    各地采用玉米辅助授粉方法，也获得丰产效果。各地实验结果证明，进行去雄授粉当年可以增产百分之五以上，用作种子，来年可以增产百分之七到十。这一措施正在推广。利用玉米品种间杂交种子的增产效果，已经确定。例如山东省五种杂交种子中的“坊杂二号”，一九五二年在胶州、泰安，莱阳等七地试验结果，平均比当地品种增产百分之四十到六十。一九五四年在潍坊十四个农业生产合作社对比结果证明：平均增产百分之七十点七，其他杂交种子均有同样效果。现在山东省已推广杂交种子一万亩以上，并进行了技术传授。目前全省已有六个专区约三百个以上的农业生产合作社学会生产杂交种子，一般获得良好的结果。
    根据米丘林学说改变外界条件提高作物生活力的先进经验，河北省农学院曾以粟、黍、高粱、玉米等作物进行了晚秋播种试验，试验证明，生活力均有所提高。以粟为例，晚秋播种的比对照一般增产百分之二十点五，抽穗早十三到十五天，并减轻了白发病和红穗病。
    应用李森科院士所提出的春麦变冬麦的原理和方法，东北农业科学研究所在变春麦为冬麦的研究上获得成果。该所先后获得了七个由春麦转变为冬麦的新类型，其中“克华”“克丰”已能在当地摄氏零下三十六度低温下越冬。这一工作仍在继续进行中。
    另外西北农业科学研究所、云南大学等处，在小麦分枝性的研究中初步查明，多肥多湿、疏栽和移植等措施，在创造分枝类型上具有重要作用。
    米丘林学说全面地传到我国后，各地作了不少无性杂交工作。华东农业科学研究所用海岛棉同陆地棉“岱字十四”嫁接培育的结果，当年现蕾开花即提早一月，次年即能和“岱字十四”同时开花，即比海岛棉在当地的开花期提早了两个月。后经几代培育，结实性已趋正常，早熟性亦渐稳定。这一工作为长绒棉选种提供了良好资料。该所的中棉和陆地棉杂种的连年培育和选择，现已获得早熟、长绒的新类型。
    华北农业科学研究所用“白茄”嫁接在“九叶茄”上获得无性杂种。嫁接当代即在果形果色上发生变异，次代并有分离现象，其中出现从未见过的类型。试验还确定，由于嫁接方法不同，变异发生的时期和程度也不同。应用嫩芽接和双接法容易获得无性杂种，并且变异程度也大。此外，浙江农学院、华南农学院、北京农业大学等处都曾先后获得无性杂种。这些研究成果，对于扫除孟德尔—摩尔根派伪科学的遗毒很有作用。
    关于阶段发育的研究，目前在小麦、棉花、水稻、粟以及蔬菜方面，也取得了初步的成绩。
    中国科学院遗传栽培室、华北农业科学研究所在一九五三年对全国有代表性的一百六十八个小麦品种作了分析，从分析的结果可以明显地看出：越是北方品种，冬种性越强；越是南方品种，春种性越强。从光照阶段上看，南方品种有三分之二对光照反应迟钝。华东、西北农业科学研究所也有类似的研究结果。水稻方面。据中国科学院植物生理研究所、华东农业科学研究所对二十一个品种分析的结果：一般能在摄氏十五到三十度条件下进行春化，天数不超过十二天。不同品种表现不同。中南农业科学研究所、西南农业科学研究所也得到类似结果。这些试验还指出：早熟品种对长光照反应迟钝，中熟、晚熟品种反应灵敏。棉花方面。中国科学院遗传栽培室、华北农业科学研究所对十二个品种分析的初步结果是：春化阶段要求摄氏二十五到三十度的温度，各品种不超过八天，早熟品种较短，晚熟品种较长。在光照方面初步证实，各品种在十二小时短光照下发育最快，节间短，株型紧凑，现蕾开花期均较长光下提早。提早天数各品种不等。吉林农业试验场查明了白菜、萝卜的春化条件，并证明春化后开花提早，千粒重增加，提供了采种上有用的资料。浙江农学院对大蒜的研究，初步揭示大蒜抽苔要求较低温度，而鳞茎形成要求较长光照。李森科院士根据阶段发育理论所创造的春化处理法，在我国也在进行试验。以陆地棉大量春化为例，据河北、山东、山西三省两年来联合试验结果，出苗期早而整齐，开花吐絮一般提早一到四天，而且集中，霜前花收量增加百分之三到十五，总产量增加百分之三到十三，苗期抗病力也有提高趋势。东北、华东、河南等地试验结果，大致相同。内蒙古和东北农业机关对春小麦的春化，华南对水稻的春化，也都初步看出有促进发育和增产的趋势。以上所述有关春化处理的试验成果，都正在作示范对比，逐渐推广。
    此外，阶段发育理论在我国生产上的具体应用，产生了良好的效果。例如一九五三年四月，山西南部在小麦拔节时，地上部分遭到寒流袭击而冻死，仅闻喜县受冻面积即达六十万亩。一九五四年四月又一次发生严重冻害，受害面积一千零四十万亩，波及五十四个县。如照老例，遇到这种冻害即将小麦割去耕翻，再种其他庄稼，当年小麦颗粒不收。但在学习米丘林学说后，华北农业科学研究所山西农村工作队根据阶段发育理论，确定受冻麦株仍能重新抽穗结实。遂在地方党政机关领导支持下，决定留下不耕，改用追肥灌溉和加强管理的办法，结果一九五三年获得每亩百斤至百数十斤的收成。一九五四年虽冻害更重，而每亩仍收八十多斤。
    关于动物方面，在米丘林学说启示下，也取得了初步成绩。
    我国许多马场配种站的工作有了提高。主要表现在牲畜妊娠率增加，幼畜死亡率减少两个方面。在家畜选种上，由于采用了苏联的经济杂交法，猪的生长加速，仔猪断乳期体重可达十八公斤。新疆省应用高加索细毛羊和当地蒙古羊及哈萨克羊杂交，育成了肉毛兼用的细毛羊，公羊体重一百六十六斤，母羊一百一十一斤，比当地羊重百分之四十到六十。剪毛量公羊为二十斤半，母羊为十四斤，比当地羊提高数倍。年来我国畜牧科学工作者在米丘林科学的指导下，正在对湖羊、寒羊、金华猪、波支猪和黄牛等地方品种进行改良工作。
    关于动物的无性杂交也作了一些试验。如南昌师范学校教师应用鹅蛋白替换鸡蛋白方法获得的杂种鸡，具有头大、颈长、腹宽、脚粗、蹼大和身体重等近似鹅的特征；而且生活力强、耐寒、生长快，在同样情况下对照鸡每天增加四点七公分，而杂种鸡增加六点三公分。四川大学以来杭鸡同红岛、芦花、澳洲黑、成都鸡及北京鸭五种蛋进行蛋白交换，结果所生雏鸡体重增加，成活率高。该校又以几种公鸡的等量精液进行混合授精，得到孵化率提高的结果。
    在家蚕方面，朱洗等曾以同品种与异品种的精子混合授精，发现母体对异品种精子具有较强的选择性。同时证明，不论同品种或异品种的混精授精，都比单父本授精的后代生活力高，抵抗力大。这一结果，在理论上实践上都有很大意义。
    以上所说的虽然只是全部成就的一部分，但已足够说明，我国的农业生物学界只要接受先进的米丘林学说的指导，摆脱资产阶级学术观点的束缚，只要同劳动人民的生产实践相结合，科学研究工作就会获得长足的进展。六年来虽然还只是获得了初步的成绩，但从我国生物学以及农学的历史上看，却标志着一个巨大的变革。
    我国的科学工作者都很清楚，旧中国留下的科学遗产是十分薄弱的，目前我国的科学水平还是比较落后的，六年来虽然获得了初步的成就，但还远不能满足生产事业对科学的要求。
    我们祖国正在进行着规模巨大的社会主义建设。社会主义建设对我国农业、林业、渔业以及生物学工作者提出了光荣而重大的任务。我们必须更加深入地学习并创造性地应用先进的米丘林学说，来完成自己的任务。
