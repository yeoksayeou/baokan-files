Vigorously Promote Putonghua
    Lao She

    In my childhood, I heard that many people used "Dream of the Red Chamber" as a textbook for learning Beijing dialect.

    This illustrates a point: Literary works have a responsibility beyond ideological education, which is to teach everyone how to write articles and speak. In the old days, the vast majority of literati wrote in classical Chinese, so ancient texts and poems became models for later generations to learn writing. Now, the vast majority of literati write in vernacular Chinese, so literary works, just like "Dream of the Red Chamber," not only teach everyone how to write articles, but also teach everyone how to speak.

    This responsibility is not small. A nation's language always tends to become more unified. Needless to explain, language unification has a very significant political impact. History has proven that literary works can powerfully aid language unification. Italy's Dante, England's Chaucer, and our Cao Xueqin have all made great contributions in this regard.

    Chinese is inherently unified. However, because there are many Han people, and they are distributed over a very vast area, it is inevitable that different places have different pronunciations, and inevitably each has its own local dialect. Our current discussion of the unification of Chinese is to demand further consistency in pronunciation, vocabulary, and certain differing grammars. The more consistent the language, the better we ourselves are united; the easier it is for fraternal nationalities and foreign friends to learn. Writers should take responsibility in this movement, exerting our power to promote language unification; this is an important political task.

    According to linguists, Chinese is a very progressive language. Unfortunately, however, Chinese characters are very difficult to learn and remember. There will be a day (I myself eagerly hope it will be sooner rather than later) when we will switch to using phonetic script. To create conditions for the future implementation of phonetic script, we should start today to adjust pronunciation and organize vocabulary and certain grammatical variations. Without such preparation, it will not be easy to implement phonetic script. If I spell according to Beijing pronunciation, and you spell according to Xiamen pronunciation, we will not be able to use phonetic script to exchange ideas. Similarly, if I speak my dialect, and you speak your dialect, our phonetic scripts will probably be separate, not related to each other. Therefore, we have now decided to conduct education in the common language of the Han nationality, using Beijing pronunciation as the standard. Why use Beijing pronunciation instead of Shanghai pronunciation as the standard? Why not teach everyone to simply speak Beijing dialect, but teach everyone to speak Putonghua (the common language of the Han nationality)? I won't explain this here, because I mainly want to talk about the attitude that writers should take towards this movement.

    I think I'll just talk about my own attitude. It's easier to be more personal this way. I've written some novels and plays. From an ideological and artistic perspective, my works are not very brilliant. However, in terms of language, because my Putonghua is not too bad, I have an advantage. For more than twenty years, my works have been used as "Mandarin" textbooks in different places. I am very happy that my not-so-brilliant works can have some practical use.

    However, even speaking solely from the perspective of language, my previous works still have some flaws: I often liked to use Beijing slang. In the past two years, I have begun to control myself and use less slang and dialect. Why? First, slang has caused me a lot of trouble: readers from all over the country often write to ask what this word means and what that sentence means, and I have to reply to each one to explain. Second, in the case of plays, too much slang makes it difficult to stage them far from Beijing. If they are said in the original words, the audience does not understand; if they are changed into local language, it is not easy to find exactly the same idioms; so, it is better to drop it and not stage it. If it is already like this domestically, it is not difficult to imagine that it will be even more troublesome when translated into foreign languages.

    I used to like to use slang, and there was a reason for it. Some slang has strong expressiveness. But experience has refuted my reasoning. Strong expressiveness? People don't understand! If they don't understand, what expressiveness is there to speak of? Works are meant to educate the people, but because there is too much slang, plays are not performed, and novels are not understood. Wouldn't that be counterproductive, reducing the effectiveness of propaganda and education?

    Based on the above experience, from now on I hope to pay attention to:

   (1) Not using slang to show off: That is to say, I will try to choose ordinary vocabulary and not deliberately flaunt slang. I should change from showing off myself to serving the masses. If "youtiao" (油条) is more common than "youzhagui" (油炸鬼), I will use "youtiao." Similarly, if "qiangjiao" (墙角) is more common than "galaner" (嘎栏儿), I will use "qiangjiao." Local color does not rely on the support of a few dialect words. To not delve deeply into the life of a place, but only use a few special local words, such as "youzhagui" and "galaner" to support it, will not bring any benefits. They are only sufficient to increase the confusion and divergence of language.

    Will doing this make the language dry and not rich? I don't think so. Take Beijing dialect for example, it has undergone great changes in the past forty or fifty years: many of the words I was accustomed to hearing and saying in my childhood have died out. The reason for this decline is that, on the one hand, everyone's life has changed, and old words cannot but retire; on the other hand, people from all over the country come to Beijing, do not understand Beijing slang, and Beijing people themselves have to adapt to the situation and take back the words that do not receive support from outsiders. Has this reduction in vocabulary made Beijing dialect dry and rigid? No. New life and new things have brought new vocabulary. Many of these new words are not native, but are created jointly by people from all over the country. So, Beijing dialect has changed: for forty or fifty years, it has become more and more consistent with the written language and more universal. Universality inevitably triumphs over locality: for decades, apart from a few Beijing-specific words such as "yagenr" (压根儿) and "meiluo" (没落) that have gained relatively widespread recognition, many authentic slang words have died out one after another.

    Today, we are single-mindedly building a socialist society nationwide, and our political life, social life, cultural life, and scientific knowledge are becoming richer day by day, so our language will inevitably become richer. Looking at tomorrow, we don't have to be reluctant to part with some local vocabulary that may be eliminated.

    (2) Selectively using slang: For example, "dun" (蹲, squat) and "zhan" (站, stand) are both common words, and I don't need to go out of my way to find other slang words to replace them; even if I find them, they are only to describe the two postures of "squatting" and "standing," and there is no special expressiveness, only making many people not understand. However, in addition to "dun" and "zhan," there is also a "qima dundang shi" (骑马蹲裆式, horse-riding stance); it is neither "dun" nor "zhan," but another posture—half-squatting and half-standing. There is no word in Beijing dialect that can generally describe this posture. We can only say "qima dundang shi," there is no other way. If I can find such a word in Beijing slang, I will definitely use it, because it has the special ability to describe a posture that is neither "dun" nor "zhan." For the same reason, if I find such a word in other dialects, I will also borrow it and introduce it into Putonghua.

    The above example illustrates how I will selectively use slang in the future. That is to say, I will no longer randomly use the slang I am familiar with, but I will consider it and decide what to take and what to discard. It also shows that I do not completely erase all slang, but I want to sift through the sand to save what is worth saving. If writers all do this, they can refine many vivid, clear, and expressive vocabularies, enriching our language. Promoting Putonghua does not require everyone to make do with what they have and write monotonous and rigid articles, but on the one hand, to purify the language and not allow slang dialects to flood the land; on the other hand, to make the language richer and healthier.

    (3) How I should create language: Writers have the right to create language. However, creating language is not the same as using slang randomly without selection. That is not creation, but laziness and expediency, and the result is that the language becomes more and more chaotic, which is not conducive to language unification. That is to say, the creation of language is not to be unconventional and make people feel profound and unpredictable, making it more and more confusing to read, but to win by surprise in a language that everyone can understand, making it both understandable and likable. In Putonghua, we have a lot of room to use our talents. Just a few examples can illustrate this point: like "Boundless forest leaves falling soughing down, Endless Yangtze River rolling, surging on," like "A little loft to hear spring rain one night, In deep lanes, tomorrow, apricot blossoms for sale," these kinds of verses, inside are extremely common words, and once the poet has processed and created them, they become immortal famous lines. In Wang Anshi's draft poems, we find that the word "green" in "Spring wind greens the southern bank of the Yangtze" has been circled and changed several times before deciding to use the word "green." Initially it was "Spring wind arrives at the southern bank of the Yangtze," then the word "arrive" was circled out and changed to "pass"; then it was changed to "enter," then changed to "full," and changed back and forth before finding the best word—"green." Ah, how much potential power there is in Putonghua, waiting for writers to discover! The famous line we all know, "Red apricot blossoms on the branch are noisy with spring," how colloquial and how expressive the word "noisy" is! Although these examples use simple classical Chinese, after all, there is a distance from modern vernacular, but this method of creation is still worth learning.

    Yes, our articles are often written plainly and without originality, rigidly and weakly. Some people blame it on our language being too simple, and some say it is limited by Putonghua. In fact, we have not put in enough effort and have not fulfilled our responsibility to create new forces from Putonghua. Therefore, we sometimes have to seek help from languages that have never been accepted by the general public to support our facade. "Chánchán" (潺潺, murmuring) and "xióngxióng" (熊熊, blazing) are vocabularies that we have been accustomed to using since we had vernacular poetry, but until today, I have not heard any worker or farmer say, "The stream murmurs" or "The fire blazes," and even I, an intellectual, still do not understand how the stream murmurs and how the fire blazes. I have such a feeling that sentences like "Spring wind greens the southern bank of the Yangtze" seem fresher and more lovely than "The fire blazes." Randomly using half-dead classical Chinese, just like randomly using dialects and slang, is a manifestation of our irresponsibility in creation. Don't say that our language is too simple, the fact is that our life is too simple, so we can't find anything to say. Don't be afraid of being restricted by the use of Putonghua, in fact, as long as we are willing to create with care, there is an endless treasure in our Putonghua.

    The above is a little experience and desire of mine on how to use Putonghua to write articles. I am willing to follow my own experience, not only to support the method of promoting Putonghua, but also to enthusiastically practice writing in this way, doing my best in this movement. However, my experience may not be quite right, so I would like to ask everyone to criticize and help me.

    大力推广普通话
    老舍
    在我童年的时候，我就听说过：有许多人拿“红楼梦”当作学习北京话的课本。
    这说明了一个问题：文艺作品在思想教育而外还有一种责任，就是教给大家怎么写文章和说话。在老年间，绝大多数的文人用文言写作，所以古文古诗就成为后人学习写作的范本；现在，绝大多数的文人用白话写作，所以文艺作品，正像“红楼梦”那样，不但只教给大家怎么写文章，也教给大家怎么说话。
    这个责任并不小。一个民族的语言总是越来越趋向统一的。用不着多解释，语言的统一有很大很大的政治作用。历史已经证明，文艺作品会有力地帮助语言的统一。意大利的但丁、英国的超叟，和咱们的曹雪芹都在这方面有很大的功绩。
    汉语本是统一的。不过，因为汉族人多，分布的地方又非常广阔，于是各地方就难免在发音上有所不同，也难免各有各的土语。我们现在谈汉语的统一就是要在发音上、词汇上，和某一些不同的语法上，要求更进一步的一致。语言越一致，我们自己就团结得越好；兄弟民族和外国朋友学起来也就越省事。作家们在这个运动中应当负起责任，尽到我们推进语言统一的力量；这是个重要的政治任务。
    汉语，据语言学家们说，是很进步的语言。可是不幸，汉字却十分难学难记。有那么一天（我自己切盼越早越好），我们会改用拼音文字。为将来推行拼音文字创造条件，我们今天就该下手调整发音，整理词汇和某一些语法上的纷歧。没有这样的准备，拼音的办法就不易下手推行。是嘛，假若我按京音拼，你按厦门音拼，咱们俩就没法子利用拼音文字交流思想。同样的，我说我的土话，你说你的土话，咱们俩的拼音文字恐怕也只好你干你的，我干我的，全不相干。因此，我们现在决定以北京语音为标准进行汉民族共同语的教育工作。为什么用北京语音而不用上海语音作标准？为什么不教大家都干脆说北京话，而教大家说普通话（汉民族共同语）？我不在这里解释，因为我主要地要说说作家对这个运动应取的态度。
    我想，就说我自己的态度吧。这么说容易亲切一些。我写过一些小说和剧本。从思想上和艺术上看，我的作品都不很高明。可是，在语言上，因为我的普通话还写得不算太坏，我占了点便宜。有二十多年了，我的作品曾经先后在不同的地方被利用为“官话”课本。我很高兴：我的不甚高明的作品能够有些实际用处。
    可是，即使专从语言上说，我从前的作品也还有点毛病：我往往爱用北京的土话。近二年来，我开始控制自己，少用土语方言。为什么呢？第一，土话给我招来许多麻烦：山南海北的读者常常来信问这个词怎么讲，那句话是什么意思，我得一一回信解答。第二，以剧本来说，土话太多，远离北京的地方就不易上演。照原词说吧，听众不懂；改成本地话吧，又不易找到恰好相同的成语；于是，只好拉倒，不去上演。在国内既已如此，赶到译为外文的时候，不难想到就一定更麻烦。
    我以前爱用土语不是没有道理的。某些土语的表现力强啊。可是，经验把我的道理碰回来了。表现力强吗？人家不懂！不懂可还有什么表现力可言呢？作品本是为教育人民的，可是因为土语太多，剧本没人演，小说读不明白，岂不弄巧成拙，反倒减少了宣传教育的效用么？
    根据上述的经验，从今以后我希望能注意到：
   （一）不用土语撑门面：这就是说，我将尽量地选用普通的词汇，不故意卖弄土语。我应当把卖弄自己改为替群众服务。假若“油条”比“油炸鬼”更普通一些，我就用“油条”。同样的，假若“墙角”比“嘎栏儿”更普通，我就用“墙角”。地方色彩并不仗着几个方言中的词汇支持着。不深入一个地方的生活，而只用几个地方上的特殊字眼儿，如“油炸鬼”和“嘎栏儿”之类去支持，是得不到什么好处的。它们适足以增加语言的混乱与纷歧。
    这样作，会不会使语言枯窘，不丰富呢？我看不会。就拿北京话来说，在过去的四五十年里就有很大的变化：我幼年听惯说惯的词汇有许多许多已经死去了。这衰死的原因一来是大家的生活起了变化，老的词汇就不能不引退；二来是全国各地的人来到北京，听不懂北京的土话，北京人自己也就不得不适应情况，把得不到外方人支持的话收起去。这样减少了词汇，北京话是不是因而枯窘死板了呢？不是。新的生活和新的事物带来了新的词汇。好多这种新词汇并非土生土长，而是由四面八方的人共同创造的。于是，北京话就变了样：四五十年来，它越变越语文一致，越富有普遍性了。普遍性必然地战胜地方性：几十年来除了“压根儿”、“没落”少数北京特有的词汇得到较比广泛的承认，很多的地道土话都先后死去。
    今天，我们正全国一心地建设社会主义社会，我们的政治生活、社会生活、文化生活，和科学知识都一天比一天丰富，那么我们的语言也必然地越来越丰富。眼睛看着明天，我们大可不必依依不舍地恋惜一些地方上的、有可能被淘汰的词汇。
    （二）选择地运用土语：举例说明：“蹲”和“站”都是普通字，我无须节外生枝地去另找土语代替它们；即使找到了，也还不过是说明“蹲”和“站”这么两个姿态，并没有什么特殊的表现力，只是教许多人不懂而已。可是，在“蹲”和“站”之外，还有个“骑马蹲裆式”；它既非“蹲”，也非“站”，而是另一个姿态——半蹲半站。北京话里还没有一个能够概括地形容出这个姿态的字。我们只能说“骑马蹲裆式”，别无办法。假若我能够在北京的土语中找到这么一个字，我一定利用它，因为它具有足以形容既非“蹲”又非“站”的姿态的特殊能力。同一理由，假若我在别的方言中找到这么一个字，我也会借用过来，介绍到普通话里去。
    上述的例子说明了我个人以后怎么选择地运用土语。这是说，我不再随便乱用我所熟悉的土语，而要经过考虑，决定何去何取。这也说明，我并不一笔抹杀一切土语，而要披沙拣金地把值得保存的保存下来。作家们要是都这么作，就能洗炼出许多生动的，明确的，和富于表现力的词汇，丰富我们的语言。提倡普通话并非要求大家因陋就简，写出千篇一律的呆板文章，而是一方面要使语言纯洁，不许土语方言泛滥成灾；另一方面要使语言更丰富更健康。
    （三）我须怎样创造语言：作家有权创造语言。但是，创造语言不等于毫无选择地乱用土语。那不是创造，而是偷懒取巧，其结果是使语言越来越混乱，不利于语言的统一。这也就是说，语言的创造不是标奇立异，令人感到高深莫测，越读越糊涂，而是要在大家都能明白的语言中出奇致胜，既使人看得懂，又使人喜爱。在普通话里，我们有很大的用武之地。随便举几个例子就能说明这个意见：像“无边木叶萧萧下，不尽长江滚滚来”，像“小楼一夜听春雨，深巷明朝卖杏花”这类的诗句，里面都是些极普通的字，而一经诗人的加工创制，就成了不朽的名句。在王安石的诗草里，我们发现：“春风又绿江南岸”的“绿”字，是经过几次圈改，而后决定用“绿”字的。最初是“春风又到江南岸”，后来圈去“到”字，改为“过”；然后又改为“入”，又改为“满”，换来换去，才找到最好的一个字——“绿”。啊，普通话里有多么大的潜在力，等待作家们去发掘啊！我们都知道的名句“红杏枝头春意闹”的“闹”字，是多么通俗而又多么富于表现力啊！这些例子虽然因为用的是浅显文言，究竟和现代的白话有个距离，可是这种创造方法还是值得学习的。
    是的，我们的文章往往写得平平无奇，死板无力，有的人归罪于我们的语言太简单，有的人说这是受了普通话的限制。其实呢，我们是没有下够工夫，没有尽到从普通话里创出新生力量的责任。因此，我们有时候就不能不求救于一向不被广大人民所接受的语言支持门面。“潺潺”呀，“熊熊”呀，是我们自有白话诗以来就惯用的词汇，可是直到今天，我也还没听见哪个工人或农民说：“溪水潺潺”或“熊熊的火光”，而且连我这个知识分子至今也还不明白溪水怎么潺潺，和火光怎么熊熊。我有这样的感觉：“春风又绿江南岸”这类的句子比“火光熊熊”似乎更新鲜可爱一些。随便利用半死的文言，正如随便利用方言土语，正是我们不负责创造的表现。不要再说我们的语言太简单吧，事实上是我们的生活太简单了，所以找不到话说。不要怕运用普通话受到限制吧，事实上只要我们肯精心创造，我们的普通话里就有无尽的宝藏。
    以上是我对怎么运用普通话写文章的一点体会与愿望。我愿意按照自己的体会，不但拥护推广普通话的办法，而且热心地这么去练习写作，尽我自己在这个运动中应尽与能尽的力量。不过，我的体会也许不大对，那就要请求大家来批评帮助了。
