    兰新路乌鲁木齐至国境段正进行选线工作
    本报乌鲁木齐十三日电　兰新铁路乌鲁木齐至国境段已开始进行选线工作。铁道部西北设计分局担任这一任务的勘测设计队队员七十余人，已于十月五日分五个组出发到现场工作。
    这次选线工作的主要任务，是要找寻出兰新路从什么地方越过国境同苏联境铁路相联接，才是一条最理想的线路。今年的主要工作，首先是调查搜集各条线路原则方案的主要资料，以便进行分析、比较；其次是利用今年八月间完成的航空摄影照片，加工制图。出发前，队员们曾利用国庆节的休假期，进行了线路方案的室内研究工作。他们满怀信心地表示：一定要通过自己的艰苦劳动，为祖国选出一条最经济、最合理的线路来。
