    Report on the First Performance of the German Democratic Republic Wind Orchestra
    Li Guoquan, Conductor of the Central Experimental Opera House Orchestra

    The German Democratic Republic Wind Orchestra held its premiere performance in Beijing on the 10th. We watched their outstanding performance and singing with great excitement. At the opening ceremony, Comrade Kurtzbach, the head of the Wind Orchestra, said it well: "We will use our performance as a gift to the Chinese people." What he called this gift is indeed precious. We sincerely thank them. The visit and performance of the German Democratic Republic Wind Orchestra, composed of musicians from the renowned and long-established German Dresden State Orchestra, gives us the opportunity to hear the exemplary performances of the great German national music, which is a rare learning opportunity for us.

    Every program they performed was warmly welcomed, and almost all programs were requested for an encore. From the first chord of the first program (Beethoven's quartet, consisting of a soprano horn, a bass horn, and two French horns), the audience was immediately captivated. They played so accurately and neatly, and the music was so harmonious, like chords played by an organ, with beautiful and harmonious tones, restrained and powerful fortes, beautiful and mellow pianos, very measured crescendo and diminuendo, and very delicate emotional expression. In this program, the performers expressed the great composer Beethoven's proud feeling of "achieving victory through struggle." The second piece of the wind ensemble was Mozart's Quintet in F major, which consisted of flute, oboe, clarinet, French horn, and bassoon. Their skilled technique and rich expressiveness allowed the performance of each instrument to be fully utilized. The flute and oboe played in the high register in a happy, singing manner; the clarinet and French horn skillfully cooperated in the middle register; and the bassoon steadily supported in the low register, forming a complete whole. The flute played brightly and clearly, the oboe lightly and movingly, the French horn and bassoon played staccato particularly flexibly, and the clarinet had a very beautiful tone. This quintet has four movements: the first movement is allegro, the second movement is andante, the third movement is a minuet (a type of European classical dance form in triple time), and the fourth movement is presto. The five performers excellently expressed Mozart's unique light, lively, and optimistic sentiment. This program was extremely popular with the audience, and they replayed the fourth movement once, but it still could not satisfy the audience's demands, so they had to play the minuet again. Another program of the wind ensemble was Rheinholdt's "Variations," which was composed of six people (two trumpets, two French horns, and two trombones). The last program was Kutz's "Sonatina" (composed of seven people, two trumpets, two French horns, two trombones, and one bass horn). These two pieces are not only unique in style, but also complex and difficult in performance technique. The performers of the wind ensemble fully demonstrated their outstanding skills here. At the beginning of "Variations," the phrases led by the second French horn and taken over by the first French horn were so soft and beautiful, full of poetry, and fascinating. The sound of the trumpet was crisp and bright, exciting; the fast staccato of the trombone played with skillful technique was accurate and powerful; and the bass was played very elastically. At the repeated request of the audience, an encore piece that was bold and full of vigor was equally loved by the audience.

    In addition to the wind ensemble programs, there were also performances by two soloists and a pianist at the evening party. Soprano soloist Maria Groni sang Schumann's "Beautiful Foreign Land" and Wolf's "I Have a Lover Living in Pana" with enthusiasm; tenor soloist Dr. Kilde Lutz sang Schubert's "Her Portrait" and Schumann's "Lotus" and other lyrical songs with great poetry. The performances of these two singers left a deep impression on people.

    Pianist Professor Roland Breitschneider played Beethoven's two impromptus (in A flat major and E minor) with superb technique and meticulous performance, and then played Schubert's "Musical Moment" at the enthusiastic request of the audience.

    The performers and singers of the German Democratic Republic Wind Orchestra all have a high level of artistic accomplishment. Through their performances and singing, we not only further recognized the German people's hardworking, simple, and firm character; further recognized the national style of musical performance; but also further gained a correct understanding of classical music art. The young musicians in the capital are enthusiastically learning from the German musicians. We believe that through this rare learning opportunity, we will gain a lot of benefit.

    记德意志民主共和国吹奏乐团首次演出
    中央实验歌剧院管弦乐团指挥　黎国荃
    德意志民主共和国吹奏乐团，十日在北京举行了首次演出。我们以十分激动的心情欣赏了他们的杰出的演奏和演唱。在开幕式上，吹奏乐团团长库茨巴赫同志说得好：“我们将以我们的演出，做为献给中国人民的礼品”。他所说的这一礼品，的确是珍贵的。我们衷心地感谢他们。由久负盛名并有着悠久传统的德国德累斯顿国家乐团的演奏家们组成的德意志民主共和国吹奏乐团这次来我国进行访问演出，使我们有机会听到伟大的德国民族音乐的典范式的演奏，是我们不可多得的学习机会。
    他们演出的每一个节目都受到了热烈的欢迎，几乎所有的节目都被观众要求再来一次。从第一个节目（贝多芬作曲的四重奏，由一个高音号，一个低音号，两个圆号组成）的第一个和弦起，听众立刻被吸引住了。他们吹奏得那样准确整齐，乐音是那么和谐，好像是管风琴奏出的和弦，音色是美丽而谐调的，强奏时含蓄有力，弱奏时美丽圆润，渐强渐弱处理得非常有分寸，情感的表现也非常细腻。在这个节目中，演奏家们表现了伟大的作曲家贝多芬的那种“通过斗争而达到胜利”的值得骄傲的心情。吹奏乐的第二个节目是莫扎特作曲的F大调五重奏，这是由长笛、双簧管、黑管、圆号、低音大管组成的。他们的娴熟的技巧和丰富的表现力，使每件乐器的性能都得到了充分的发挥，横笛和双簧管在高音部愉快地歌唱似地演奏着；黑管和圆号在中音部巧妙地配合着；低音大管在低音部稳稳地衬托着，形成一个完整的整体。长笛吹奏得明亮透澈，双簧管轻巧动人，圆号和低音大管的顿音吹奏的格外灵活，黑管的音色也很优美。这一个五重奏共有四个乐章：第一乐章快板，第二乐章慢板，第三乐章小步舞曲（是一种三拍子的欧洲古典舞的曲式），第四乐章是急板，五位演奏家出色地表现了莫扎特特有的轻快活泼的乐观情调。这一节目极为听众欢迎，他们将第四乐章重演了一次，但还是满足不了观众的要求，以致不得不又将小步舞曲演奏了一次。吹奏乐的另一个节目是兰因霍尔特的“变奏曲”，这是由六个人组成的（两个小号，两个圆号，两个长号）。最后一个节目是库茨的“小奏鸣曲”（由七人组成，两个小号，两个圆号，两个长号，一个低音号）。这两首乐曲，不仅别具风格，而且演奏技术也是复杂艰深的。吹奏乐团的演奏家们在这里充分地显示了他们的卓越的技巧。在“变奏曲”的一开始，由第二圆号引出、由第一圆号接上的乐句，是那样柔美，充满了诗意，令人神往。小号的声音清脆嘹亮，激动人心；以熟练的技巧吹奏着的长号的快速顿音准确而有力；低音演奏得非常富于弹性。在听众一再要求下，加演的一首豪迈的富有朝气的乐曲，也同样博得了听众的喜爱。
    晚会上除吹奏乐节目外，还有两位独唱家和一位钢琴家的表演。女高音独唱家玛丽亚·格隆妮热情奔放地演唱了舒曼的“美丽的异乡”和沃尔夫作曲的“我有个爱人住在拍娜”；男高音独唱家基尔德·芦茨博士非常富有诗意地演唱了舒伯特的“她的像片”和舒曼的“荷花”等抒情歌曲。这两位歌唱家的演唱，给人们留下了深刻的印象。
    钢琴家罗兰德·勃莱特施耐德教授，以纯熟的技巧和细致的表演，演奏了贝多芬的两首即兴曲（降Ａ大调和Ｅ小调），在观众热情的要求之后又演奏了一首舒伯特的“音乐的一瞬间”。
    德意志民主共和国吹奏乐团的演奏家们和演唱家们，都有着高度的艺术修养。通过他们的演奏和演唱，我们不仅进一步认识了德国人民的勤劳朴实和坚强不移的性格；进一步认识了音乐表演上的民族风格；也进一步得到了对古典音乐艺术的正确的理解。首都的年青的音乐工作者们，正在热情地向德国的音乐家们学习。我们相信，通过这次难得的学习机会，我们是会得到很多的教益的。
