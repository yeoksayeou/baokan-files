Expanding the Ranks of Authors of Children's Literature
    Yuan Ying

The Soviet writer Mikhalkov once used these sentences to evaluate the achievements of the immortal children's literature writer Gaidar:

    Warrior, writer, Bolshevik
    And citizen Gaidar
    Left sincere and pure works
    As a gift to the nation.

I cite these few lines of poetry as the beginning of this article because of my heartfelt respect for outstanding children's literature writers—the engineers of children's souls. Now, how much we need children's literature writers like Gaidar who devote their lives and even their lives to the great cause of educating the new generation! Our country has entered a new historical period, and the Party is leading the people of the whole country with full confidence to build our motherland into a strong socialist country. Children are our future, and they will take over our cause and uphold the banner of socialist communism until the final victory. Therefore, the Party and the state must cultivate them to become socialist new people who love the motherland, love the people, love labor, love science, protect public property, are healthy, lively, brave, and honest, and to teach them to aspire to be excellent socialist builders. The target of children's literature is 120 million readers, which is an extremely arduous and important task before our children's literature workers.

Strictly speaking, our children's literature workers have not yet formed a team. At present, the number of people who are regularly engaged in children's literature work across the country, including professional and amateur, is very small. Compared with other fronts of literature, this front seems to be the weakest. To complete the above tasks, on the one hand, more professional writers need to participate in this work; at the same time, it is necessary to expand the ranks of authors in all aspects of society, especially in departments that are directly and indirectly in contact with children.

In recent years, a group of new authors have emerged one after another, providing children with a lot of spiritual food. At the national children's art and literature creation awards held in 1954 after four years, two-thirds of the 22 award-winning authors in literature were new authors; in the new book counters in bookstores, we can also often find new names. Among these new authors who have entered the garden of children's literature, many are middle and elementary school teachers, Young Pioneer instructors, youth league children's workers, and children's newspaper workers. It should be said that this is an important source for expanding the ranks of authors of children's literature. Because they are all people who directly bear the important responsibility of educating children, their work requires them to first have a heart that loves the new generation and loves the Party's education cause. This is also a prerequisite for a children's literature author. The great Russian literary theorist and educator Belinsky said:

      "...Children's literature writers should grow out, not be made.
      To be a children's literature writer is a special mission. This
      requires not only talent, but also special genius... Yes,
      to be a children's literature writer requires many, many conditions,
      a rich, loving, gentle, quiet, child-like pure soul...
      Of course, love for children and a deep knowledge of the needs,
      characteristics, and differences of children of all ages is one of the most important conditions."

If we use these to require a children's literature worker, then teachers, instructors, and other children's workers have many favorable conditions. They are familiar with the lives and thoughts and feelings of children, and it is possible to reflect the face of the new generation of the motherland more realistically. In children's literature, works that describe children's school and family life and Young Pioneer life are always the most popular. Children like to read Soviet children's literature, but they cannot help but repeatedly ask, "Why can't we see books that describe our lives?" Isn't it easy to understand the children's mood? They are eager to see the reflection of their happy and rich lives in literary works, and to see examples to learn from in their peers in the works. Similarly, for children's literature workers, isn't reflecting the diverse lives of children in this era and expressing their excellent qualities of gradual maturity in many aspects one of our important topics? To solve this problem, it is necessary for writers to deeply familiarize themselves with children's lives—just as they once or are deeply familiar with the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers; and teachers, instructors, and children's workers who live with children for a long time and are enthusiastic about children's literature have good conditions in this regard.

In some of their published works, there are more depictions of real children's lives, and there are some images of brave, lively, and witty new Chinese children. There are fewer monotonous and boring characters and language full of admonitions. These authors have brought a fresh breath to our garden of children's literature. They should be an important part of the ranks of children's literature authors, and their works have shown their undeniable potential strength.

Only when the ranks of authors continue to expand can children's literature develop in terms of the breadth of themes and the diversity of styles. We need to give children multi-faceted education, guide them to the vast world, unfold various pictures of the construction of the motherland in front of them, and inspire their love for the motherland and the cause of socialist construction through vivid artistic images; so that the heroic figures on all fronts of the motherland can leave an indelible impression in the hearts of future builders and become their role models. However, so far, many important aspects of our boiling reality have not been reflected positively or negatively in children's literature works. For example, the theme of the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries is not well represented. Other topics such as heavy industrial construction, geological surveys, planting forests, opening up borders and wasteland, and building railways, highways, and water conservancy projects are all topics that urgently need to be expressed; for example, there are not many works that reflect the domestic revolutionary war and the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea, border defense, coastal defense, and the life of the national defense army; biographies of revolutionary leaders are eagerly expected by the majority of children, but we have not been able to meet their requirements; and we have written even less about fairy tales, adventure stories, travel notes, etc., which they especially like and need. A large number of authors from various corners will use their works to guide children to greatly expand their horizons.

However, expanding the ranks of authors of children's literature is not an easy task. In the process of a large number of teachers, instructors, and children's workers moving towards children's literature work, along with their favorable conditions, there are also some subjective obstacles and objective difficulties.

Our ranks of teachers, instructors, and children's workers are very large, but at present, only a very small part of them are engaged in children's literature work. Many comrades do not seem to fully realize the great impact of children's literature on children, or do not see their own favorable conditions for engaging in this work. They always hope that writers will write and are willing to give writers various help; but when it comes to themselves, they have no courage. Dear friends, since you have dedicated yourselves to the cause of educating the next generation, why not use this most effective educational tool? Since you love our next generation, why not do a little more work to give them one more share of nourishment? The creative paths of many accomplished children's literature writers all started from a teacher's position, and their creations are equally successful as teachers. We should also have such confidence.

In addition, some amateur authors do not treat this cause as seriously and earnestly as other authors, do not work hard to familiarize themselves with children's lives, study the characteristics of children's psychology, and weave all their love into their works, but treat the new children's literature work with old and wrong views, thinking that it is the lowest level and the easiest to do; they even regard it as a "stepping stone" or "knocking brick," publish one or two works, and then put it aside to engage in adult literature works. They think: "Engaging in children's literature is the most hopeless." How can people with this kind of thinking use the spirit of socialist communism to educate the new generation?

To effectively expand the ranks of authors of children's literature, it is also necessary to help amateur authors solve some practical difficulties, and all aspects should provide help and support.

First of all, it is necessary to strengthen the connection between professional writers of children's literature and new amateur authors, and overcome the long-term state of separation that exists in the ranks of authors of children's literature. Amateur authors urgently need the Writers Association to provide help in terms of creative ideas and creative methods; similarly, professional writers can also learn and learn a lot of fresh and unheard-of things from teachers, instructors, and children's workers. The result of this mutual learning and mutual help will make our ranks of authors of children's literature continue to grow stronger, and the quality of children's literature will continue to improve.

Until today, many amateur authors who are interested in children's literature are still in a state of isolation and helplessness. They say that they are "self-employed" and have always been left to fend for themselves. Many authors feel that the local Writers Association branches and literary federations rarely care about them and help and guide them in their creation in various ways. This abnormal state of separation makes it impossible to solve some problems in creation in a timely manner. For example, in our creation, there are still some works that lack clear ideological content to a greater or lesser extent; more seriously, there are also some works that express wrong educational ideas. And in some works, there is also a tendency of formalism and conceptualization. The authors themselves need to constantly improve their ideological and artistic cultivation and strive to create better works, but they also need the guidance and help of writers who are at the forefront.

A new author will never forget the joy of publishing his first work, nor will he forget the encouragement given to him by the fair reviews of his work in newspapers and periodicals. Newspapers and literary publications can often discover and cultivate a group of new authors and gradually promote them to the road to prosperity. Today, in the field of children's literature, we more urgently need this kind of help. If newspapers and literary publications can regularly publish some children's literature creations and related reviews, and put forward and discuss important issues in creation and theory in a timely manner, instead of just publishing a few articles every year on "June 1st," works should be criticized and introduced in a timely manner, and a social atmosphere that attaches importance to children should be gradually formed to attract more authors to join the ranks of children's literature.

Expanding the ranks of authors of children's literature needs the support of other relevant parties in addition to the Writers Association and the Literary Federation. For example, when a teacher or instructor is enthusiastic about this cause and indeed has prospects for development, can the school administration and the League organization give him a certain amount of time and conditions to engage in creation under the principle of not affecting his work too much? Can he be given more help in terms of ideology and work as a result? This kind of help and support will enable the creative work of an amateur author to be carried out under the care and supervision of everyone, encourage and inspire his interest and courage, and make him have a serious sense of responsibility for the cause he is engaged in. Now, some authors have such encounters: they squeeze out time for rest after heavy lesson preparation, grading homework, or other work to write for children, and people will criticize him for "not being at ease with his work." His works are published in newspapers and periodicals, and he will be criticized for being "bourgeois individualistic with the idea of fame and profit," and he will be asked to make a review and write a paragraph on his annual appraisal. In this way, these enthusiastic comrades cannot but reduce or even give up their interest in children's literature.

We believe that with the Party's infinite care, with the attention and support of all relevant parties, and with the participation of the vast number of teachers, instructors, children's workers, and all other amateur authors, our children's literature will rapidly expand its ranks of authors and overcome various obstacles and difficulties to shoulder the arduous and glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party and the state. Today, the Party has put forward the call to vigorously create, publish, and distribute children's books. The "People's Daily" editorial on September 16 clearly pointed out: "In order to continuously strengthen the creation of children's literature, on the one hand, it is necessary to establish a team of professional children's literature writers,... On the one hand, it is necessary to train a large number of new writers. At present, among youth league cadres, teachers, instructors, and state workers, there are many beginners who love to write children's books and have prospects for development. The Chinese Writers Association and local literary federations should give them warm care and guidance to help them grow up, instead of letting them fend for themselves."

Amateur authors, teachers, instructors, and children's workers comrades, as a children's literature worker, I applaud you, and I look forward to and welcome you to join our team with great enthusiasm. Please enthusiastically participate in and cherish our glorious cause a hundred times. Like Gaidar, "leave sincere and pure works as a gift to the nation." Let us remember Gorky's words: "...All our ideals for the victory of human reason and will over undeveloped nature, all our ideals for the creation of a kingdom of social justice on earth, and all our spiritual wealth will be left to our children, to the creators of tomorrow's life."

Being able to do more work for the "creators of tomorrow's life," being able to add a share of "spiritual wealth" to them, letting it blossom and bear fruit for a long time like sowing seeds in spring, that is our greatest joy.

    扩大少年儿童文学的作者队伍
    袁鹰
    苏联作家米哈尔柯夫曾用这样的句子来评价不朽的少年儿童文学作家盖达尔的功绩：
    战士、作家、布尔什维克
    和公民的盖达尔
    把真挚的纯洁的作品
    作为礼物留给了国家。
    我所以举这几句诗作为本文的开端，是由于怀着对优秀的少年儿童文学作家——少年儿童的灵魂的工程师们的衷心的敬意。现在，我们是多么需要像盖达尔那样把自己的毕生精力以至生命都献给教养新生一代的伟大事业的少年儿童文学作家啊！我们的国家已经进入了一个崭新的历史时期，党正领导全国人民满怀信心地要把我们的祖国建成一个强大的社会主义国家，少年儿童是我们的未来，他们将要接替我们的事业，把社会主义共产主义的旗帜撑持到最后的胜利。因此，党和国家要把他们培养成为爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物、健壮、活泼、勇敢、诚实的社会主义新人，要教导他们立志做一个社会主义的优秀的建设者。少年儿童文学的对象，是一亿二千万的读者，这是摆在我们少年儿童文学工作者面前的一个极其艰巨、极其重大的任务。
    严格说来，我们的少年儿童文学工作者，至今还没有形成一支队伍。现在全国各地经常从事于少年儿童文学工作的，包括专业和业余的在内，人数很少，比起文学的其余各个战线来，这条战线似乎是最薄弱的。要完成上述任务，一方面，需要更多的专业作家们参加这个工作；同时，更要在社会的各个方面、首先是在直接和间接同少年儿童接触的部门里扩大作者队伍。
    近几年来，陆续出现了一批新的作者，他们为少年儿童们提供了不少的精神食粮。在一九五四年举行四年来全国儿童文艺创作评奖时，文学方面得奖的二十二位作者中，就有三分之二是新作者；在书店里的新书柜上，我们也可以经常地发现新的名字。这些走进少年儿童文学园地来的新作者，其中有不少是中学和小学教师，少年先锋队辅导员，青年团的少年儿童工作人员和少年儿童报刊工作者。应该说，这是扩大少年儿童的作者队伍的重要来源。因为，他们都是直接负着教育少年儿童重责的人，他们的工作要求他们首先具有一颗热爱新的一代、热爱党的教育事业的心。这对一个少年儿童文学作者来说，同样是一个先决的要求。伟大的俄罗斯的文艺理论家和教育家别林斯基说过：
          “……儿童文学作家应当是生长出来的，而不
      是做出来的。作一个儿童文学作家，是一种特殊的
      使命。这不仅要求有才能，而且要求有特殊的天才
      ……是的，要作一个儿童文学家，需要很多很多的
      条件，需要丰富的、慈爱的、温和的、静穆的、孩
      提般纯洁的灵魂。……当然，对儿童的热爱和对各
      种年龄儿童的需要、特点和差异的渊博知识，是最
      重要的条件之一。”如果以这些来要求一个少年儿童文学工作者，那末，教师、辅导员和其他的少年儿童工作者们就具有不少有利的条件。他们熟悉少年儿童的生活和思想感情，有可能比较真实地反映祖国新的一代的面貌。在少年儿童文学读物中，描写少年儿童的学校和家庭生活、少先队生活的作品，总是最受欢迎的。孩子们是喜欢阅读苏联少年儿童文学作品的，可是他们禁不住一再提出质问：“为什么看不见描写我们的生活的书呢？”孩子们的心情不是很容易理解的吗？他们渴望着能从文学作品里看到自己的幸福的、丰富的生活的反映，能从作品里自己的同辈身上看到可以学习的榜样。同样，对少年儿童文学工作者来说，反映这一时代的少年儿童的多种多样的生活，表现他们的多方面的日渐成熟的优良的品质，岂不是我们的重要课题之一吗？解决这个问题，作家们深入熟悉少年儿童生活——如像他们曾经或正在深入熟悉工人、农民和士兵生活一样——是必需的；而跟孩子们长期生活在一起、又热情于少年儿童文学事业的教师、辅导员、少年儿童工作者们，在这方面就有了很好的条件。
    在他们已发表的一些作品中，比较多地出现了一些真实的少年儿童生活的写照，出现了一些勇敢、活泼、机智的新中国少年儿童的形象，比较少地出现单调枯燥的人物和充满了教诲式的语言。这些作者为我们的少年儿童文学的园地带来了一派清新的气息。他们应该是少年儿童文学作者队伍的重要组成部分，他们的作品已经显示了他们的不可忽视的潜在力量。
    只有作者队伍不断扩大，少年儿童文学在题材的广阔性和风格的多样性上，才有可能得到发展。我们需要给孩子们以多方面的教育，引导他们走向广阔无垠的天地，在他们的面前展开祖国建设的各种各样的画面，通过活生生的艺术形象，鼓舞起他们热爱祖国、热爱社会主义建设事业的感情；使祖国各个战线上的英雄人物，能够在未来的建设者心里留下不可磨灭的印象，成为他们学习的榜样。但是，到目前为止，我们的沸腾的现实生活中的许多重要方面，都还没有在少年儿童文学作品中得到正面或侧面的反映。例如说：关于肃清反革命的斗争的主题，就表现得很不够。其他如重工业的建设、地质勘察、种植森林、开辟边疆和荒地、修建铁道、公路和水利工程等等，都是迫切需要表现的题材；例如反映国内革命战争和抗美援朝斗争、边防、海防和国防军生活的，也不算多；革命领袖的传记，是广大少年儿童如饥似渴地期望着的，但是我们没有能满足他们的要求；而对于他们所特别喜爱、特别需要的童话、探险故事、游记等等，写得更少。广大的来自各个不同的角落的作者们将用自己的作品引导孩子们大大地扩展他们的眼界。
    但是，扩大少年儿童文学的作者队伍也并不是一件轻而易举的事。在广大的教师、辅导员、少年儿童工作者走向少年儿童文学工作的过程中，同他们的那些有利条件一起，也存在着一些主观上的障碍和客观的困难。
    我们的教师、辅导员、少年儿童工作者的队伍是十分庞大的，但是目前参加少年儿童文学工作的，毕竟只是很少很少的一部分。有不少同志似乎还没有充分认识到少年儿童文学对孩子们的重大影响，或者没有看到自己的从事这个工作的若干有利条件，他们总是希望作家们去写，愿意给作家各种帮助；可是说到自己，就没有勇气了。亲爱的朋友们，既然你献身给教育下一代的事业了，为什么不去运用这个最有效的教育工具呢？既然你热爱我们的下一代，为什么不多做一点工作，让他们获得一分更多的滋养呢？有许多有成就的儿童文学作家的创作道路，都是从一个教师的岗位开始的，他们的创作和教师工作同样有成绩。我们也应该有这样的信心。
    此外，也有一些业余作者不是像其他作者那样严肃、认真地对待这一事业，不是努力地去熟悉少年儿童生活、研究少年儿童心理的特征，把自己底全部的爱织在作品里，而是带着旧的错误的看法来对待新的少年儿童文学工作，认为它最低级，最容易做；甚至把它当作“垫脚石”、“敲门砖”，发表了一两篇作品，就把它丢在一旁，搞成年人的文学作品去了。认为：“搞少年儿童文学最没出息。”有这种思想的人，又怎么能用社会主义共产主义精神去教育新的一代呢？
    要有效地扩大少年儿童文学的作者队伍，还必须帮助业余作者们解决一些实际困难，各方面要给以帮助和支持。
    首先，要加强少年儿童文学的专业作家和新的业余的作者的联系，克服少年儿童文学的作者队伍长时期存在着的隔裂状态。业余作者们迫切地需要作家协会从创作思想和创作方法上给以帮助；同样，专业作家们也可以从教师、辅导员和少年儿童工作者那里学习、了解到很多新鲜的、闻所未闻的东西。这种互相学习、互相帮助的结果，就会使我们的少年儿童文学的作者队伍不断地壮大，使少年儿童文学的质量不断地提高。
    直到今天，不少有志于少年儿童文学的业余作者还处在孤立无援的状态。他们说自己是“单干户”，一直是自生自灭的。许多作者都感觉到：当地作家协会分会和文联，很少去关心他们，以各种方式帮助和指导他们进行创作。这种不正常的隔裂状态就使得创作中的一些问题，得不到及时的解决。例如，在我们的创作中，多多少少也还存在一些缺乏鲜明的思想性的作品；更严重的是，也还有一些表现错误的教育思想的作品。而在某些作品中也有公式化概念化的倾向。作者们自己需要不断提高思想和艺术修养，努力创作较好的作品，但是，他们也需要走在前面的作家们的指导和帮助。
    一个新的作者永远不会忘怀第一个作品发表时的喜悦，也不会忘怀报刊上对他底作品的公正的评论所给他的鼓舞。报纸和文艺刊物常常能发现和培养一批新作者，并且一步步地推动他们走向康庄大道。今天，在少年儿童文学方面，我们更迫切地需要这种帮助。报纸和文艺刊物如果能经常发表些少年儿童文学创作和有关的评论，及时地提出和讨论创作和理论上的重要问题，而不是只在每年“六一”时才发表几篇文章，作品应该及时得到批评和介绍，要在社会上逐渐形成重视少年儿童的风气，吸引更多的作者加入少年儿童文学的队伍。
    扩大少年儿童文学的作者队伍这一项工作，除了作家协会和文联以外，还需要得到其他一些有关方面的支持。例如，当一个教师或辅导员热心于这个事业、并且确实有发展前途的时候，学校行政当局和团的组织，是不是可以在不太影响工作的原则下，能给他一定的时间和条件从事创作呢？是不是可以因而从思想上和工作上给他以更多的帮助呢？这种帮助和支持，就使一个业余作者的创作工作在大家的关怀和督促下开展，鼓舞和激励他的兴趣和勇气，并且使他对自己从事的事业有了严肃的责任感。现在，一些作者有这样的遭遇：他们在繁重的备课、批改作业或其他工作之余挤掉休息的时间，为少年儿童写作，人家会批评他“不安心工作”，他的作品在报刊上发表了，会批评他是“资产阶级个人主义的名利思想”，要他作检讨，并且还在年终鉴定上写上一条。这样，就不能不使得这些热情的同志减少以至放弃对少年儿童文学事业的兴趣。
    我们相信，在党的无限关怀下，在各有关方面的重视和支持下，在广大的教师、辅导员、少年儿童工作者和一切其他的业余作者的参加下，我们的少年儿童文学将迅速扩大自己的作者队伍，克服各种障碍和困难，去担负党和国家交给我们的艰巨的、光荣的任务。今天，党已经提出了大力创作、出版、发行少年儿童读物的号召了。“人民日报”九月十六日社论里明确地指出：“为了不断加强少年儿童文学创作工作，一方面要建立一支专业的少年儿童文学作家的队伍，……一方面要大量培养新作家。目前在青年团干部、教师、辅导员、国家工作人员当中，有不少喜爱写作少年儿童读物并有发展前途的初学写作者。中国作家协会和各地文联应当给他们以热情的关怀和指导，帮助他们成长起来，而不应任其自生自灭。”
    业余作者们，教师、辅导员和少年儿童工作者同志们，作为一个少年儿童文学工作者，我向你们鼓掌，万分热忱地期待和欢迎你们参加我们的队伍，请热烈地参加并百倍地热爱我们的光荣的事业吧。像盖达尔那样，“把真挚的纯洁的作品，作为礼物留给了国家”吧。让我们记住高尔基的话：“……我们对于人类理性和意志战胜未开发的自然界的这一切理想，对于在地球上创造社会正义王国的这一切理想以及我们全部的精神财富，都将留给我们的儿辈，留给明天生活的创造者。”
    能为“明天生活的创造者”多做一分工作，能给他们增加一分“精神财富”，像春天里播下种籽一样让它在长久以后开花结果，那是我们的最大的快乐。
