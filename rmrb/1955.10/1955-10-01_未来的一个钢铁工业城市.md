    A Future Iron and Steel Industrial City
    Bao Mucang
    The western region of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a rich and beautiful area of mountains, fields, and grasslands. The Yellow River runs through the middle of this vast grassland, with fertile farmland along both banks. The saying "The Yellow River has a hundred harms, but only benefits the Hetao" refers to the Hetao area—a granary of the motherland. The majestic Daqing Mountains and Wula Mountains stretch along the north of the Yellow River, like a city wall extending in both east and west directions. To the north of the mountains is the Ulanqab grassland stretching towards the Mongolian People's Republic, and to the south of the Yellow River is the Ordos grassland. There are also endless beaches here. In this vast and beautiful area of mountains, fields, and grasslands, there are not only robust livestock and valuable grain, but also extremely rich and diverse mineral resources. Some ores are already exposed on the surface. There is a saying circulating among the people: "With a bucket in one hand and a basket in the other, after drawing water, you can pick up some coal and cook a meal."
    Baotou, a city with a history of about two hundred years, is located on this fertile plain. The reactionary rulers of past dynasties, the Manchus, the Kuomintang, and their comprador merchants, used this city as a base to rule and exploit the vast number of farmers and herdsmen here. They had been clamoring for "development" for decades, but in fact, not only did they not develop anything, but even the small and pitiful industry that originally existed was destroyed to the point of near collapse.
    After liberation, in order to build socialist industry and develop the industrial economy of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Party and the People's Government were determined to develop the rich mineral resources in this area and decided to start building another iron and steel industrial base here during the first Five-Year Plan for socialist economic construction.
    Now, all around Baotou is filled with scenes of construction. In the mountain valleys of the Daqing Mountains and Wula Mountains, on the mountain tops, at the foot of the mountains, along the banks of the Yellow River, in the fields, and even on the beaches, one can see measured markers—red and white flags, tripods, as well as drilling towers and wells probing the geological structure. In the new planning area—which was once a vast field a year ago—buildings are already emerging one after another, and rows of scaffolding are being erected. Cranes soaring into the sky are rotating in the air. Trucks and trains transporting construction materials are speeding by.
    From the very beginning of the construction of the Baotou Iron and Steel Industrial Base, the Party Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and the Party and government leading organs of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have uniformly deployed tens of thousands of construction workers and engineering technicians, organizers of construction undertakings, as well as a large amount of materials and technical strength to come here. If you go to the construction sites and take a look at the factory markings on those machines and cars, and ask about the sources of those materials, you will discover how Beijing, Anshan, Shanghai, Nanjing, and factories in major cities across the country and workers from all over are supporting the construction of Baotou. On the markings of those machines, you can also see the names of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. These also naturally make you feel how brotherly countries are helping us.
    The construction of the new iron and steel industrial city has greatly changed the original appearance of the city.
    In the past, Baotou was a commercial city, but the market was sluggish. In the more than twenty years from the arrival of the railway to the eve of liberation in 1949, there were only some facilities serving the city, such as electric lights, telephones, and tap water. As for industry, there was only a flour mill, a leather factory, and some small handicraft workshops.
    Now, with the needs of basic construction and the improvement of people's living standards, Baotou's local industry has achieved unprecedented development. In the past year, in addition to expanding the power generation and leather factories that existed before liberation, the machinery factory and refractory material factory newly built after liberation were also expanded. New factories serving basic construction, such as brick and tile, automobile repair, carpentry, and oxygen factories, have been built. In addition, a new type of modern state-owned Baotou Sugar Factory with an annual output of 40 million jin of granulated sugar, which serves daily consumption, has also appeared. The development of local industry is also reflected in the continuous improvement of productivity. According to statistics, the total output value last year increased by 1,728 percent compared with 1950. The total output value in the first half of this year has increased by more than 143 percent compared with the same period last year.
    Baotou has long been known as a "land and water port." However, at the time of liberation, the city had only a few civilian vehicles. Now, the state-owned Baotou Transportation Company alone controls more than two hundred state-owned and private automobiles, thousands of rickshaws, animal-drawn carts, and more than a thousand camels. More than five hundred state-owned and private wooden boats sail on the Yellow River. This year, a tugboat will also be launched to participate in shipping. The development of Baotou's construction and transportation industries supplies a large amount of materials brought from various places to the surrounding rural and pastoral areas. According to statistics for the first four months of this year, more than 15,000 tons of various fabrics and daily necessities were transported from Baotou to the pastoral areas and rural areas of the Ulanqab and Yikezhao leagues and the Hetao Administrative Region.
    With the development of industrial construction, Baotou's market is also becoming increasingly prosperous. In the past, a large field was seen upon leaving the station, but now there are all new buildings there. Before liberation, there was no sewer in the city, and there were only forty street lights in total. At that time, the citizens donated 20,000 silver dollars to build sewers, but most of the money was embezzled by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and only a small portion of the money was used to build a non-functioning open ditch. After liberation, these conditions have disappeared forever.
    In order to complete the national plan, those who are active on the construction sites, those who are looking for treasures in the deep mountains and wilderness, work hard without fear of any difficulties. Once, several of us went to the construction site and encountered a storm. The sky was filled with yellow sand, and people could not be seen a few meters away. The car we were in had to stop halfway for several hours. However, on this very day, the workers at the expansion site of the state-owned Baotou Power Plant overfulfilled the excavation of the trench project by 40 percent.
    Baotou is rapidly advancing towards a socialist iron and steel industrial city. A difficult and great project will, in the near future, be built for the first time in the economically backward ethnic minority areas on the frontier of the motherland, sending tens of thousands of tons of steel continuously to all parts of the country to support socialist economic construction and national defense construction.

    未来的一个钢铁工业城市
    宝木仓
    内蒙古自治区的西部地区，是一片富庶而美丽的山野和草原。黄河，横贯在这个辽阔的草原中部，沿河两岸是一片肥沃的农田。“黄河百害，唯利一套”就是指这儿河套地区——祖国的一个粮食宝库。巍峨的大青山和乌拉山，沿着黄河的北边，就像一道城墙一样一直向东西两个方向伸展。山北是伸向蒙古人民共和国的乌兰察布草原，黄河以南是鄂尔多斯草原。这里还有望不到边的沙滩。在这一大片美好的山野和草原地带，不仅有肥壮的畜群和宝贵的粮食，还蕴藏着极丰富而多种多样的矿产资源。有些矿石已经表露在地面上。在人民中流传着这样一句话：“一手拿水桶，一手拿筐筐，打好水，回头拣些煤就能吃熟饭。”
    包头，这个已有二百年左右历史的城市，就座落在这样富饶的原野上。历代的反动统治者，满清、国民党及其买办奸商们，就是以这个城市为据点，统治和剥削这里的广大农牧民。几十年来他们也曾喊叫过“开发”，事实上不仅没有开发出什么，连那原来仅有的小而可怜的工业都被破坏得奄奄一息了。
    解放后，党和人民政府为了建设社会主义工业，为了发展内蒙古自治区的工业经济，决心开发这一带的丰富矿产，并决定了在社会主义经济建设的第一个五年计划内开始在这里建设我国的另一个钢铁工业基地。
    现在，在包头的周围，到处弥漫着建设的景象。在大青山和乌拉山的山沟里，在山巅上，山麓下，在黄河的边沿上，在田野里，甚至在沙滩里，都可以看到测量过的标志——红白旗、三脚架以及探测地层结构的钻塔和钻井。在新的规划区——一年前曾经是一片空旷的田野里，现在已经出现了一幢一幢的楼房，一排排的脚手架。耸入天空的起重机在空中旋转。运输建筑器材的汽车和火车奔驰。
    包头钢铁工业基地的建设一开始，党中央、中央人民政府和内蒙古自治区的党政领导机关，就统一调配了数以万计的建筑工人和工程技术人员、建设事业的组织者以及大量的物资和技术力量来到这里。如果你到各工地走一走，看看那些机器和汽车上的出厂标记，问一问那些器材的来源，你就会发现北京、鞍山、上海、南京和全国各大城市的工厂和各地的工人都在怎样支援包头的建设。你在那些机器的标记上，还能看到苏联和各人民民主国家的名字。这些也很自然地使你感到兄弟国家在怎样帮助我们。
    新的钢铁工业城市的建设，已大大改变了原来城市的面貌。
    过去，包头是一个商业城市，但市面不景气，自有铁路到一九四九年解放前的二十多年间，才有了一些为城市服务的电灯、电话、自来水等设备。说到工业，只有一个面粉厂、一个皮革厂，和一些小手工业作坊。
    现在，随着基本建设的需要和人民生活水平的提高，包头的地方工业得到了空前的发展。去年一年内，除扩建了解放前原有的发电、皮革两厂外，还扩建了解放后新建的机械厂、耐火器材厂。新建了为基本建设服务的砖瓦、汽车修配、木器、氧气等工厂。另外，还出现了为生活消费服务的新型的近代化的年产四千万斤白砂糖的国营包头糖厂。地方工业的发展还表现在生产率的不断提高上。据统计，去年的生产总值比一九五○年提高了百分之一千七百二十八。今年上半年的生产总值，又比去年同一时期增长了百分之一百四十三以上。
    包头，很早以来，就被称为“水旱码头”。但在解放的时候，全市只有几辆民用汽车。现在，仅由国营包头运输公司掌握的就有国营和民营的汽车两百多辆，有几千辆人力车、兽力车和一千多峰骆驼。五百多只国营和民营木船航行在黄河水面上。今年还将有一只拖轮下水，参加航运。包头的建设和交通运输事业的发展，把从各地运来的大批物资供应给四周的农村和牧区。根据今年头四个月的统计，从包头运往乌兰察布和伊克昭两盟以及河套行政区等地牧区和农村的各种布匹、日用百货，就达一万五千多吨。
    随着工业建设的发展，包头的市面，也日益兴隆了。过去一走出车站就是一大片田野，现在那里全是新的建筑物。解放前，全市没有一条下水道，路灯总共才有四十多盏。那时，市民们曾捐献了两万块银元修下水道，但是大部分钱都被国民党反动派的官吏贪污了，仅用很小一部分钱修了一条不起作用的明水沟。解放后，这些状况已经一去不复返了。
    为了完成国家计划，那些在工地上活跃着的人们，在深山荒野里寻找宝藏的人们，不怕任何困难而辛勤劳动。有一次，我们几个人去工地，遇上了暴风，天空黄砂弥漫，几公尺外看不见人，我们坐的汽车只好在中途停了几个钟头，可是，就在这一天，国营包头发电厂的扩建工地上的工人竟超额百分之四十完成了挖地槽工程。
    包头，它正在迅速地向社会主义钢铁工业城市前进。一个艰巨的伟大工程，在不久的将来，将破天荒第一次在经济落后的祖国边疆少数民族地区建成，以成万吨的钢铁源源不断地送往全国各地，支援社会主义经济建设和国防建设。（原载内蒙古日报）（附图片）
