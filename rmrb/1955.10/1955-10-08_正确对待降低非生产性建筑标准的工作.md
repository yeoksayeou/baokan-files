    Correctly Treat the Work of Lowering Standards for Non-Productive Buildings
    Li Yinpeng, Director of the Urban Construction Department of the State Construction Commission

    Since the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the directive to "resolutely lower the standards of non-productive buildings," all relevant departments have actively responded to this call, saving a large amount of funds. The cost of new houses designed after July is generally lower than the new indicators.

    However, some design workers have an incorrect understanding of this directive from the Party Central Committee and the State Council. After Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report "Practice Thrift and Strive to Complete Socialist Construction" was published, some people said, "Buildings can't be built anymore, and even if they are, they won't look like buildings." Some said, "You want the horse to run fast, but you don't want the horse to eat grass; it's really hard for a clever woman to cook without rice!" Others said, "What architectural art is there with such low costs? Architects are useless too." Instead of actively researching and improving designs to achieve the goal of economizing, they are simply calculating costs on paper and adopting simple methods such as using inferior materials, without considering the progress of the project and the preparation of materials. As a result, the cost seems to be reduced on paper, but new waste is created when the entire project is calculated. For example, for the three dormitory buildings of Peking University, the designers changed the original flat roof to a sloping roof, but the 23 tons of steel bars used for the original flat roof had already been cut off and most of them had been tied. If the sloping roof is rebuilt, the steel bars will be stockpiled, and it will be difficult to transfer them from other places. Fortunately, this matter was discovered and corrected early, so no waste was caused. Some projects have already prepared high-grade materials according to the drawings (such as first- and second-grade wood, machine-made bricks, etc.), but the designers have revised the drawings to use low-grade materials (such as third- and fourth-grade wood, handmade bricks, etc.). In this way, the construction unit has to stockpile the original materials and then apply for low-grade materials, causing unnecessary waste such as returning materials, round-trip transportation, work stoppages waiting for materials, and waiting for drawings.

    In fact, with the active research of most designers, we have now designed some building drawings with lower costs than the central government's. For example, the two-story residential buildings designed by the First Ministry of Machine Building Design Branch for the Northeast region are budgeted at 55 yuan per square meter. The preliminary estimate of the four-story mixed-structure residential building designed by the Beijing Design Institute in July is also 55 yuan per square meter. These costs include the costs of water and sewage, lighting, heating and other equipment. This shows that it is not that buildings cannot be built, but it depends on how the designers design them.

    Furthermore, is it impossible to build suitable and relatively beautiful houses with less investment? That is also not the case. Among the house designs, the design of residences (family dormitories) is more difficult. However, according to the central government's residential cost standards (20 yuan to 60 yuan per square meter), it is still possible to build houses that meet the needs. For example, our current three- and four-story residential buildings can accommodate four households per unit, one household with three rooms and three households with two rooms each, each with a separate kitchen and toilet. Each household uses a separate corridor, which can independently form a living area. Moreover, each household can also ensure that they live in a room with a good orientation (south or east), and each room can have cross ventilation. Each household also has its own water supply and drainage pipes, lighting, heating and other equipment. Even when one household lives in one room, one household can walk through one door, and at most two households can share one kitchen and toilet. Because the room area of the living room is different (from 10 square meters to 17 square meters per room), the distribution of use can be flexibly allocated according to the different populations of the households. The usable area of this type of building is also large, and the plane coefficient reaches 55%. It is a mixed structure with rubble foundations. The walls are designed in two types. The roofs are also divided into flat roofs and sloping roofs. In this way, it is convenient for various places to flexibly use them according to the local material conditions and construction technology. This type of building can also use precast hollow floor slabs and precast concrete door and window frames. Except for the door leaf and window core, there are no flammable materials. According to preliminary design, based on Beijing's material and labor prices, each square meter only costs 48.2 yuan to 51.5 yuan. Such a residence is bright, well-ventilated, and very suitable.

    These examples show that the cost indicators instructed by the central government, except in places with special geological conditions and particularly expensive materials, are completely capable of building economical, suitable, and quite beautiful houses. The saying that "you want the horse to run fast, but you don't want the horse to eat grass" is unfounded.

    As for the design of bungalows, some designers say: "Bungalows are very simple. Which commoner has ever designed a house? Give it to the construction unit and find a few tilers and carpenters to build it." They believe that building bungalows does not require technology, and a few trainees can design them. Of course, bungalows are not as complicated as buildings, but they cannot be taken too simply. The state has to spend hundreds of millions of yuan every year to build millions of square meters of houses. If we do not conduct research and analysis well, do not plan according to local conditions and design with local materials, it will be difficult to carry out construction in a planned and organized manner, and waste will inevitably be caused. For example, building 10,000 square meters of bungalows requires about 800 cubic meters more wood than buildings. In this way, is it not worth the attention of designers to save wood and research wood substitutes in bungalow construction? The newly built brick arch roofs and bamboo roof frame bungalows by the Beijing Real Estate Management Bureau only cost 28 yuan per square meter. If this experience is studied and promoted, it can not only build suitable and beautiful houses, but also save a lot of money. This shows that building bungalows is not a simple and easy task that does not require architects and engineers to do.

    To implement the central government's comprehensive spirit of thrift in housing construction, it is not enough to rely on the efforts of design workers alone. It is also necessary to strengthen the connection between design departments and material and construction departments, cooperate and supervise each other, research new materials, improve technology, and tap potential. In the next two years, if we can save an average of five yuan per square meter for the country within the central government's control indicators, while ensuring suitability and quality, we can save about 100 million yuan. This figure is completely achievable as long as all construction personnel cooperate and work hard.

    正确对待降低非生产性建筑标准的工作
    国家建设委员会城市建筑处处长　李荫蓬
    在党中央和国务院指示“坚决降低非生产性建筑的标准”以后，各有关部门积极响应了这一号召，节约了大量资金。七月份以后新设计的房屋造价，一般都低于新的指标。
    但是，对党中央和国务院这个指示，在某些设计工作人员中还有不正确的理解。李富春副总理的“厉行节约，为完成社会主义建设而奋斗”的报告发表后，就有人说：“楼房盖不成了，盖起来也不像个楼样了。”有的说：“要叫马儿跑得好，又要马儿不吃草；真是巧媳妇难为无米之炊呀！”又说：“那样低的造价还有什么建筑艺术呢？建筑师也没用了。”他们不是积极地研究改进设计来达到节约的目的，而是片面地在图纸上算账，采取简单的改用次料的办法，不考虑工程进度和备料情况。结果从图纸上看是降低了造价，但从整个工程计算反而造成了新的浪费。例如北京大学建筑的三幢宿舍楼房，设计人员把原设计的平顶改为坡顶，但是原设计平顶所用的二十三吨钢筋已经截断，并已大部分绑好，如果改建坡顶，钢筋就要积压，而且外调也有困难。幸亏这件事被发觉纠正得早，才没有造成浪费。还有些工程已按图纸备置了高级材料（如一、二级木材，机制砖等），而设计人员又把图纸修改为用低级材料（如三、四级木材，手工砖等），这样，建设单位就要把原来的材料积压起来，再去申请低级的材料，造成退料、往返运输、停工待料、待图等不应有的浪费。
    其实，在大多数设计人员的积极钻研下，目前我们已设计出了一部分低于中央造价的楼房图纸来。例如，第一机械工业部设计一分院给东北地区设计的二层住宅楼房，按预算每平方公尺造价五十五元。北京市设计院在七月份设计的四层混合结构住宅楼房，初步概算每平方公尺造价也是五十五元。这些造价中都包括上下水道、照明、暖气等设备费用在内。这说明并不是盖不成楼房，而要看设计人员如何来设计。
    再说，以较少的投资是否就不能建造出适用而又比较美观的房子呢？也不是的。在房屋设计中，住宅（家属宿舍）的设计是比较困难的。但是，按照中央指示的住宅造价标准（每平方公尺二十元至六十元），仍然能盖出适合需要的房子。例如我们现在设计的三、四层住宅楼房，每单元可住四户，一户是三间居室，三户是每户两间居室，各单独用一个厨房和厕所。每户单独用一个走道，可独自形成一个生活范围。并且，每户还可保证居住一个朝向好的（向南或向东）房间，各个房间都可通穿堂风。每户也都各有上下水管道、照明、暖气等设备。就是一户住一室时，也可以一户走一个门，最多两户共用一个厨房和厕所。因居室的房间面积不同（每间由十平方公尺到十七平方公尺），在分配使用上，可按住户人口不同，灵活分配。这种建筑的利用面积也大，平面系数达到了百分之五十五。它是混合结构，毛石基础。墙设计成两种。房顶也分平顶和坡顶两种。这样，就便于各地在采用时按当地的材料情况和施工技术灵活运用。这种建筑也可以采用预制空心楼板和预制混凝土门窗框。除门扇和窗心外，没有什么易燃的材料。按初步设计，以北京市材料和工资价格估算，每平方公尺只要四十八元二角到五十一元五角。这样的住宅既明亮，空气又通畅，也很适用。
    这些实例说明，中央指示的造价指标，除在地质特殊和材料特别贵的地方外，是完全可以建造出经济适用和相当美观的房屋的。认为“又要马儿跑得好，又要马儿不吃草”的说法，是没有根据的。
    至于对平房的设计，在设计人员中有这样一种说法：“平房很简单，老百姓盖房子那个做过设计？交给施工单位，找几个瓦工、木工就盖起来了。”他们认为盖平房用不着技术，有几个练习生就能设计。固然，平房不像楼房那样复杂，但也不能把它看得太简单了。国家每年都要支出数亿元的资金来建造千百万平方公尺的房屋，如不很好地进行研究分析，不去因地制宜地规划和就地取材来设计，是很难有计划有组织地进行建筑，并且不可避免地会造成浪费的。例如，每建筑一万平方公尺面积的平房就比楼房要多用约八百立方公尺的木材。这样，在平房建筑中节约木材并研究木材代用品，难道就不值得设计人员注意吗？北京市房产管理局最近新建的砖拱顶和竹屋架平房，每平方公尺造价才二十八元。如果把这个经验加以研究推广，既可以建造适用、美观的房屋，又可节约大量资财。这说明建筑平房并不是一件简单易行，用不着建筑师、工程师们动手的小事。
    要在房屋建筑中贯彻中央全面的节约精神，只靠设计工作人员的努力是不够的，还必须加强设计部门和材料、施工部门的联系，互相协作、督促，研究新材料，改进技术，挖掘潜力。今后两年，如果我们能在中央的控制指标内，在保证适用和保证质量的条件下平均每平方公尺给国家节约五元，就可以节约约一亿元的资金。这个数字，只要全体建筑人员协作努力，是完全可以达到的。
