The economic situation of poor peasants in Caotang Township, Changsha County
Investigation Team of the Rural Work Department of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Poor peasants are the main force on which the Party relies in carrying out the agricultural cooperation movement in rural areas. In order to understand the economic situation and ideological conditions of poor peasants, and to effectively solve various problems of poor peasants, so as to give full play to the backbone role of poor peasants in the cooperative movement, we conducted an investigation into the situation of poor peasants in Caotang Township, Changsha County. The results of the investigation are summarized as follows:

At the time of the land reform in Caotang Township, there were 249 households of hired and poor peasants, accounting for 54.25 percent of the total number of households in the township. From the land reform to 1954, there were still 147 households of poor peasants (including 4 households that had declined from middle peasants, and 18 households transformed from other working people), accounting for 34.03 percent of the total number of households in the township; the number of people was 624, accounting for 30.16 percent of the total population of the township. These 147 poor peasant households had a total of 253 laborers, accounting for 26.64 percent of the total number of laborers in the township; 1,610.29 mu of cultivated land, accounting for 21.59 percent of the total cultivated area of the township; 18.92 head of cattle, accounting for 15.82 percent of the total number of cattle in the township; 292.6 pieces of main agricultural implements (referring to plows, harrows, waterwheels, and threshing barrels), accounting for 19.4 percent of the total number of main agricultural implements in the township. The reasons why they did not rise, in addition to the more common factor that they received less and worse things during the land reform and the thoroughness of the emancipation was not complete, can be analyzed from their own perspective with four reasons: (1) Production was not smooth and they encountered setbacks one after another. There were a total of 10 households like this. (2) A total of 43 households were unable to rise due to natural disasters or the impact of weddings, funerals, and illnesses, resulting in large deficits. (3) A total of 45 households were unable to rise because the original family fortune was too weak, or the population was large, the income was small, and the expenses were large. (4) A total of 27 households were old, weak, widowed, or lacked or lost labor. The failure of these poor peasants to rise is also related to our failure to implement the class policy well in the past. After the land reform, we did not pay attention to relying on and supporting poor peasants in our work. This is first reflected in the fact that some poor peasants were still excluded from participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and some, although they had participated, were in a disadvantageous position within the mutual aid and cooperative organizations because they were not regarded as the object of reliance. Secondly, there was insufficient care for poor peasants in terms of economy. For example, there was an average distribution of loans. For example, in the 1954 loans, poor peasant loan households accounted for only 44 percent of the total number of loan households, and the amount of loans accounted for only a little more than 45 percent of the total amount of loans, while old and new middle peasant loan households accounted for a little more than 53 percent of the total number of loan households, and the amount of loans accounted for a little more than 48 percent of the total amount of loans.

Economic characteristics of poor peasants: 1. Lack of means of production, making it difficult to maintain even simple reproduction. The average amount of production investment per poor peasant household is less than that of middle peasants. The land is more than 61 percent less than that of middle peasants, the average number of cattle per poor peasant household is 0.13 head, the average number of cattle per middle peasant household is 0.51 head, the average number of main agricultural implements per poor peasant household is 1.99 pieces, and the average number of main agricultural implements per middle peasant household is 5.78 pieces. According to the survey of typical poor and middle peasant households in 1954, the average production investment (including agriculture and sideline occupations) per poor peasant household was more than 60 percent less than that of middle peasants. Due to the lack of means of production and low production investment, poor peasants have poor production and low yields. According to the survey of the 1953 output, the rice output of poor peasants was an average of 33 jin less per mu than that of middle peasants. 2. Due to the family's deficit and lack of means of production, it is impossible to do a good job in agricultural production, and there is even less capital to engage in sideline production. The main sideline occupation of the peasants in this township is raising pigs. Looking at the sideline income in 1954, the income from livestock breeding of poor peasants accounted for only a little more than 10 percent of their total income, while the average income from livestock breeding per middle peasant household was more than three times higher than that of poor peasants. Due to low income, they often cannot make ends meet, and the deficit is getting bigger and bigger, and the debt is getting more and more. Looking at the debt situation of poor peasants, except that the amount of debt in 1953 was slightly less than that in 1952 due to the bumper harvest of rice and autumn and winter crops in 1952, the debt in 1954 increased by more than 52 percent compared with 1953, and increased by more than 31 percent compared with 1952.

According to the difference in the current economic situation of poor peasants, the existing poor peasants can be roughly divided into three types:

(1) Although there are difficulties in production and life, the labor force is relatively strong or large, and there are still some means of production. There are a total of 65 households of this type, accounting for more than 44 percent of the total number of poor peasant households and 14.1 percent of the total number of households in the township. Although these households have many difficulties, they have a high enthusiasm for production and are full of confidence and hope for the future. Especially since the vigorous implementation of the class policy last year, the political status of poor peasants has been improved. At present, 20 percent of the poor peasant households have become leading cadres or mutual aid group leaders in agricultural production cooperatives. They expressed their active support for the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. They said: Now that the government controls the grain, it is stable and reliable, and there is no fraud in buying and selling. We will no longer be exploited by private merchants and wealthy households. Their attitude towards participating in agricultural production cooperatives is generally positive and enthusiastic. They believe that joining the cooperative has three advantages: 1. After joining the cooperative, the income is distributed mainly according to labor, and there is a guarantee of increased income; 2. After joining the cooperative, the land is managed in a unified manner, so there is no need to worry about not having cattle to plow the fields, and there is no need to worry about not having fertilizer to apply to the fields; 3. After joining the cooperative, the actual income is calculated, so there is no need to worry about not having grain to sell during the unified purchase. After these people join the cooperative, they generally show positive and hardworking performance after education, and always consider the interests of the cooperative. For example, Wang Yungui, the poor peasant vice-chairman of the Zhongxing Agricultural Cooperative, has been actively working hard since joining the cooperative, fearing that he will not be able to run the cooperative well. He takes the lead in doing things that others in the cooperative are unwilling to do. When he sees the crops of the agricultural cooperative falling on the roadside, he takes the initiative to help them up. Another example is Hu Haitao, a poor peasant cooperative member of the Xinlong Agricultural Cooperative, who has been consistently active and responsible for the work of the cooperative since it was established, and puts forward opinions whenever he sees unreasonable things.

(2) The population is large, the labor force is insufficient, and the production is more difficult. There are a total of 55 households of this type, accounting for 37.41 percent of the total number of poor peasant households and 12 percent of the total number of households in the township. These households are always behind others in production, and are often discriminated against and attacked by others. They are generally positive about joining the cooperative; however, some people still have concerns: 1. They are afraid that the cooperative will not be willing to absorb them, feeling that "sparrows cannot keep up with geese," and that "the agricultural cooperative is a locomotive, and they are neither fish nor fowl, and cannot implicate the good feet"; 2. They are afraid that they will not be taken care of after joining the cooperative, believing that "although everyone is rising together in the cooperative, how can every ant climb a tree"? 3. They are afraid that they will not be able to afford the share capital and production investment. For example, the poor peasant Cao Maolin said: "I cannot afford to join the cooperative. The cattle and farm tools are turned over to the public, and I have to pay money, which I cannot afford; if I have to invest, I have no money to invest." After these households join the cooperative, although they are active and hardworking, they feel that "the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak" because they have many difficulties. The first is that the family life is difficult, they take care of the cooperative but cannot take care of the family, and they feel that they cannot afford to work together every day after joining the cooperative. For example, the poor peasant Hu Fuquan wanted to grow some vegetables to tide over the summer famine. One day he took an early morning to plant pumpkins at home and was a little late for work. The cooperative members criticized him, saying that as a cooperative member (Hu is a cooperative affairs committee member), he was so selfish and set a bad example. He felt that the family's difficulties could not be solved, and the cooperative's affairs were not done well, so he became negative. When there was no food to eat at home, he simply lay down and refused to work, letting the cooperative members scold him. Secondly, the farm tools are broken and incomplete (small farm tools in the cooperative are brought by each household), and they are not full, so they cannot do the work as well as others and get less work points. Thirdly, the price of cattle and farm tools is摊按亩分摊calculated based on the mu of land, adding a new debt, and they feel that the burden is heavy.

(3) Old, weak, widowed and orphaned households, who have difficulty in life and rely mostly on the help of relatives and friends and government relief. From their own conditions, it is impossible for them to do a good job in production and life. There are a total of 27 households of this type, accounting for 18.37 percent of the total number of poor peasant households and 5.9 percent of the total number of households in the township. Their desire to join the cooperative is also very urgent. They mainly consider the following two aspects: First, in the past, they relied on the help of relatives and friends, but in the future, relatives and friends will join the cooperative and only take care of the affairs of the cooperative, so they will no longer be able to rely on them. Second, after joining the cooperative, the fields will be managed by the cooperative, and they will be free from worry; some also plan to do some work that they can do in the cooperative, earn some work points, and may increase their income.

    长沙县草塘乡贫农的经济情况
    中共湖南省委农村工作部调查组
    贫农，是党在农村中开展农业合作化运动所依靠的主要力量。为了了解贫农的经济状况、思想状况，切实解决贫农的各种问题，以充分发挥贫农在合作化运动中的骨干作用，我们到长沙县草塘乡对贫农情况进行了调查，调查结果综述如下：
    草塘乡土地改革的时候共有雇、贫农二百四十九户，占全乡总户数的百分之五十四点二五。土地改革后到一九五四年，还有贫农一百四十七户（包括中农下降的四户，其他劳动人民转化的十八户），占全乡总户数的百分之三十四点○三；人数六百二十四人，占全乡总人口的百分之三十点一六。这一百四十七户贫农共有劳动力二百五十三个，占全乡劳动力总数的百分之二十六点六四；耕地一千六百一十点二九亩，占全乡总耕地面积的百分之二十一点五九；耕牛十八点九二头，占全乡耕牛总数的百分之十五点八二；主要农具（指犁、耙、水车、扮桶）二百九十二点六一件，占全乡主要农具总数的百分之十九点四。他们没有上升的原因，除由于土地改革的时候分得的东西较少较差、翻身不透这个较普遍的因素外，就其本身来分析，原因有四：（一）生产不顺手，接连碰钉子。这样的户共十户。（二）因受天灾，或因婚、丧、疾病影响，以致亏空大不能上升的共四十三户。（三）原来家底太薄，或人口多、收入少、开支大，以致未能上升的共四十五户。（四）老弱孤寡缺乏或丧失劳力的共二十七户。这些贫农未能上升，同我们过去未能很好地贯彻执行阶级政策也有关系。土地改革后，我们在工作中未注意依靠和扶植贫农，这首先表现在：仍有部分贫农因受排斥没有参加互助合作组织，有的虽已参加，但是因为未被当作为依靠对象，在互助合作组织内处于不利地位。其次是在经济上对贫农照顾不够。如发放贷款中就有平均发放现象。如一九五四年的贷款，贫农贷款户数只占贷款总户数的百分之四十四，贷款金额只占贷款总金额的百分之四十五强，而老中农和新中农贷款户数占贷款总户数的百分之五十三强，贷款金额占贷款总金额的百分之四十八强。
    贫农的经济特点：一、生产资料缺乏，即使保持简单再生产也有困难。平均每户贫农占有生产投资数同中农比较，土地比中农少百分之六十一强，耕牛贫农每户平均零点一三头，中农每户平均零点五一头，主要农具贫农每户平均一点九九件，中农每户平均五点七八件。据一九五四年度对贫、中农典型户的调查，贫农每户平均生产投资（包括农副业）较中农少百分之六十强。贫农由于生产资料缺乏，生产投资少，生产搞不好，产量低。据调查一九五三年的产量，贫农的稻谷产量较中农每亩平均少三十三斤。二、由于家底亏，缺乏生产资料，没法搞好农业生产，更没有本钱搞副业生产。这个乡农民的主要副业是喂猪。就一九五四年的副业收入看，贫农牲畜饲养收入只占其总收入的百分之十强，而中农每户平均牲畜饲养收入比贫农多三倍多。由于收入少，经常入不敷出，亏空越来越大，负债越来越多。就贫农负债情况来看，除一九五二年稻谷和秋冬作物丰收，因而一九五三年欠债额略少于一九五二年外，一九五四年负债较一九五三年增加百分之五十二强，较一九五二年增加百分之三十一强。
    根据贫农当前的经济情况的差别来划分，现有贫农大致可分三种类型：
    （一）生产、生活上虽有困难，但是劳力较强或较多，并且多少还有一点生产资料的。这种户共六十五户，占贫农总户数的百分之四十四强，占全乡总户数的百分之十四点一。这些户困难虽然多，但是生产热情很高，对前途满怀信心和希望。特别自去年大力贯彻执行阶级政策后，贫农的政治地位有所提高。目前贫农中有百分之二十的户当上了农业生产合作社的领导骨干或互助组长。他们对粮食统购统销政策表示积极拥护，他们说：如今政府掌握粮食，稳稳当当，买进卖出毫没有一点欺假，我们再也不受私商和富裕户的剥削了。他们对参加农业生产合作社的态度，一般是积极热情的。他们认为入社有三好：一、入了社，以劳为主分配收益，增加收入有把握；二、入了社土地统一经营，不愁没耕牛犁田，也不愁没肥料下田；三、入了社，实收实算，不怕统购的时候没粮交售。这些人入社后，经过教育一般都表现积极肯干，处处为社的利益着想。如中星农业合作社贫农副社长王云贵，入社后积极肯干，生怕办不好社，社里别人不愿做的事，他带头去做，一见农业合作社的庄稼歪倒在路边上，就主动去扶起。又如新隆农业合作社贫农社委胡海涛，社建成后对社的工作一贯积极负责，一看见不合理的事就提意见。
    （二）人口多，劳力缺少，生产困难较大的。这种户共五十五户，占贫农总户数的百分之三十七点四一，占全乡总户数的百分之十二。这些户生产老是走在人家后头，经常受别人的歧视和打击。他们对入社一般是积极的；但是部分人仍有顾虑：一，怕社里不愿吸收自己参加，感到“麻雀跟不上雁鹅飞”，“农业合作社是火车头，自己不三不四，坏脚不能连累好脚”；二，怕入社得不到照顾，认为“在合作社里虽然是大家共同上升，但哪里只只蚂蚁都上得树”？三，怕摊不起股金和生产投资，如贫农曹茂林说：“我入社是入不起的，耕牛农具归公，要我出钱，我出不起；要投资，我没有钱投。”这些户入社以后，虽积极肯干，但是因为自己困难多，感到“心有余而力不足”。首先是家里生活困难，顾得社里顾不得家里，对入社后天天要统一出工感到吃不消。如贫农胡福泉想多种点小菜渡夏荒，有一天抽了个早晨在家栽南瓜，出工迟了点，社员就批评他，说他身为社委（胡是社务委员），这样自私自利，起了坏的带头作用。他感到家里的困难问题不能解决，社里的事情也没搞好，就消极下来。家里没有饭吃的时候，就干脆躺着不出工，让社员骂。其次是农具破烂不齐（社内小农具由各户自带），吃饭不饱，因此工夫做不赢别人，得的工分少。再次是按亩摊耕牛农具折价款，新添了一笔债，感到负累重。
    （三）老弱孤寡户，生活困难，多靠亲戚朋友的帮助和政府救济。他们从本身条件来说，是无法搞好生产、生活的。这种户共二十七户，占贫农总户数的百分之十八点三七，占全乡总户数的百分之五点九。他们入社的要求也很迫切，他们主要从如下两方面来考虑：一，过去靠亲戚朋友帮助，将来亲戚朋友都入了社，只顾得搞社里的事，无法再靠他们。二、入了社，田归社管，自己免得操心；也有的是打算在社里做点自己能做的活，挣点工分，还可能增加点收入。
