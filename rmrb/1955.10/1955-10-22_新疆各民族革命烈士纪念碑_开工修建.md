    Construction Begins on "Xinjiang Revolutionary Martyrs Monument of All Nationalities"

    (Our newspaper Urumqi, 21st dispatch) The "Xinjiang Revolutionary Martyrs Monument of All Nationalities," built by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to commemorate revolutionary martyrs such as Chen Tanqiu, Mao Zemin, Lin Jilu, Ahemaitijiang, and Abasofu, officially broke ground at 9:00 AM on October 20th.

    The "Xinjiang Revolutionary Martyrs Monument of All Nationalities" is being built in front of the south gate of the People's Park near the Urumqi River. The entire construction, in addition to the monument, will also include a martyrs' hall with flowerbeds, statues, railings, etc., covering a total area of ​​18,000 square meters. The monument is solemn and majestic, 14 meters high, with Chairman Mao's inscription on the front: "Communism is irresistible! A single spark can start a prairie fire! Long live the fallen martyrs!" The other three sides are engraved with the same inscription in Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian and other languages. The monument project will be completed in early next year.

    Since the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang, the people of all ethnic groups have repeatedly proposed the construction of a martyrs' monument at the Urumqi Municipal People's Representative Conference to commemorate the immortal achievements of revolutionary martyrs such as Chen Tanqiu for the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. This proposal has received the attention of the government and support from all sides. From October 1954, the Urumqi Municipal People's Government began preparations for the construction of the monument. After several designs and the production of sketches and models by the construction unit, the Urumqi Municipal People's Committee invited relevant people from all ethnic groups and sectors to hold discussions to solicit opinions. Finally, the construction was officially started after approval by the Xinjiang Autonomous Region People's Committee.

    “新疆各民族革命烈士纪念碑”开工修建
    本报乌鲁木齐二十一日电　新疆各族人民为纪念陈潭秋、毛泽民、林基路、阿哈买提江、阿巴索夫等革命先烈修建的“新疆各民族革命烈士纪念碑”，在十月二十日上午九时正式破土开工。
    “新疆各民族革命烈士纪念碑”建筑在靠乌鲁木齐河的人民公园南门前，全部建筑除纪念碑外，还有烈士馆，馆内有花圃、塑像、栏围等，共占面积一万八千平方公尺。纪念碑庄严雄巍，高十四公尺，正面有毛主席的题字：“共产主义是不可抗御的！星星之火可以燎原！死难烈士万岁！”其它三面分别用维吾尔文、哈萨克文、蒙古文等三种文字刻着同样的题词。纪念碑工程将在明年年初完工。
    新疆和平解放后，各族人民为纪念陈潭秋等革命先烈对新疆各族人民的不朽功绩，曾先后数次在乌鲁木齐市各族各界人民代表会议上，提议修建烈士纪念碑。这一提议受到了政府的重视和各方面的支持。从一九五四年十月，乌鲁木齐市人民政府即开始进行建筑纪念碑的准备工作。这座纪念碑经承建单位数次设计，制出草图和模型后，乌鲁木齐市人民委员会又邀请各族各界有关人士举行座谈，征求意见，最后经过自治区人民委员会批准，才正式动工修建。
