Organizing the broad masses of workers to save raw materials in the production process is always a regular task for all industrial production departments. This is not only because thrift is an important management principle of socialist enterprises, but also because raw material costs account for a large proportion of industrial product costs (sometimes as much as 70 to 85 percent). Strict saving of raw materials enables us to produce more products with the same amount of raw materials, reduce product costs, and promote the improvement of labor productivity. Conversely, enterprises that do not pay attention to saving raw materials cannot fully complete the state plan, and product costs will inevitably be very high.

This year, various enterprises have carried out comprehensive conservation work, and have achieved certain results in saving raw materials. From mid-March to mid-September, employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company collected more than 68,000 tons of scrap steel, non-ferrous metals, and rare metals, many of which have been used to replace good materials for production; workers in various steel rolling mills used steel billets with unclear steel grades and excessively short sizes that had been piled up in warehouses for a long time to roll steel rails, and have processed more than 40,000 tons. Workers in the material preparation section of Tianjin Bicycle Factory used 52,800 yuan worth of stagnant materials and waste materials this year to process products worth 74,800 yuan, saving 110 tons of good steel. They also researched using self-made materials to replace certain imported materials, which can save the country more than 490,000 yuan in foreign exchange annually. They constantly improved technology, increased the material utilization rate to 94 percent, and reduced the scrap rate. Hundreds of "Youth Conservation Teams" have emerged in production enterprises across the country, launching various activities to collect waste materials, utilize stagnant materials, and save materials in the production process. However, judging from the overall situation of saving raw materials, this work is not yet satisfactory. Enterprises have not collected and utilized all waste materials; the handling of stagnant materials is very slow, and the work of using substitutes under the condition of ensuring product quality is not done well; the work of saving raw materials in the production process still lacks regularity. In order to ensure the comprehensive completion of the national production plan and the increase production and practice economy plan, the leading staff of various enterprises should quickly overcome these shortcomings and further organize the work of saving raw materials.

The experience of the Shenyang Transformer Factory's metalworking workshop in learning from the Soviet Union's "No Raw Materials Requisition Day" is a method of organizing employees to save raw materials that deserves attention.

The so-called "No Raw Materials Requisition Day" means that workers carry out comprehensive, regular, and small-scale savings in the production process, and take one day out of a month to use the saved raw materials to produce various products for the country. This advanced experience first appeared in the Moscow "Paris Commune" shoe factory in the Soviet Union. The initiator was the production captain of this factory, Kolaberinikova. She proposed this initiative in March 1950, and it was immediately responded to by workers in the entire workshop and factory, and quickly spread to various industrial production departments in the Soviet Union. The result of implementing "No Raw Materials Requisition Day" saved the country millions of rubles. The raw materials saved by the "Paris Commune" shoe factory in one year could be used to produce 170,000 more pairs of shoes. Due to her great contribution to the country, Kolaberinikova won the Stalin Prize in 1951 and was elected as a representative to the Supreme Soviet.

The Shenyang Transformer Factory's metalworking workshop has achieved significant results in promoting "No Raw Materials Requisition Day." The first group of turners in the first section of the workshop began to learn from this experience in July this year under the leadership of the Party committee, and by the end of September, they had realized 34 "No Raw Materials Requisition Days," producing 1,035 finished products using scrap. Now, 35 groups in nine workshops throughout the factory have promoted this experience. The metalworking workshop of Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory learned from the practice of the metalworking workshop of Shenyang Transformer Factory. From September 5th to early October, the first and second groups of turners in the second section completed 30 "No Raw Materials Requisition Days," saving the country 3,382 yuan.

The leading staff of all enterprises must not underestimate the role of this advanced experience. "No Raw Materials Requisition Day" is a heroic action by the broad masses of workers to cherish national wealth, promote socialist labor enthusiasm, and consciously practice thrift. The most positive significance of "No Raw Materials Requisition Day" lies in its clear and loud call for all workers to contribute more to the country's construction cause in their labor. Through this specific goal, workers are organized to carry out comprehensive and regular material saving activities. Especially important is to mobilize workers not only to save materials, but also to quickly use the saved materials for production. Completing a "No Raw Materials Requisition Day" is not easy. Workers must pay attention to saving every bit, saving not only major materials but also auxiliary materials, not only constantly calculating the amount of savings, but also fully considering how to use them in production. In this way, workers will inevitably carry out more complex activities in production that can improve the level of enterprise management: strictly implement and reduce material consumption quotas, enabling enterprise management personnel to quickly find advanced and scientifically based material planning consumption quotas, and change backward quotas, which is a necessary condition for strengthening planned management; in order to save raw materials, workers will consciously and actively study and learn new technologies, constantly improve operating methods, and invent and create various advanced tools to improve technical level and carry out creative labor to reduce material consumption and eliminate defective products, which is the most reliable foundation for strengthening technical management; through the above two aspects of achievement, product costs can be greatly reduced. This shows that widely carrying out the "No Raw Materials Requisition Day" campaign can not only comprehensively organize the work of saving raw materials in production, but also an effective measure to mobilize the masses of workers to ensure the comprehensive completion of the national plan.

When promoting "No Raw Materials Requisition Day," the leading staff of enterprises should pay attention to expanding its scope according to the specific circumstances of the enterprise, and should not rigidify this advanced experience, but should allow this bud to grow and strengthen in all aspects. Originally, the raw materials needed for "No Raw Materials Requisition Day" were saved in the production process, but in the current situation where various enterprises have accumulated a lot of waste and stagnant materials, and some products still feel that raw materials are insufficient, the utilization of waste materials, stagnant materials, and substitute materials should all be regarded as activities of "No Raw Materials Requisition Day," which will create a large amount of wealth for the country. Wangjiayuan Mine No. 4 underground hillside mining area of Jiangxi Pingxiang Mining Bureau promoted "No New Materials Requisition Day" in mid-September. Under the premise of safe production, it used old pit props for production for five consecutive days, saving 23.5 cubic meters of new pit props, worth more than 1,200 yuan. This practice is worthy of praise. According to the requirements of "No Raw Materials Requisition Day," the saved materials should be used to produce complete commodities for the country, just like the "Paris Commune" shoe factory. This is entirely possible in some enterprises, such as light industrial production units and metallurgical, chemical, and building materials enterprises. The Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant Youth Conservation Team once used holidays to refine a furnace of steel for the country on September 17 using collected scrap steel. Of course, for some enterprises, it is difficult to produce finished products entirely from saved raw materials, such as large steel, machine tools, locomotives, ships, and so on. In such enterprises, workers should be mobilized to use "No Raw Materials Requisition Day" to produce various components or parts for the country. The Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory once proposed to launch the "No Raw Materials Requisition Shift" campaign based on the characteristics of large punching and shearing machine capacity and high material requirements, which was warmly welcomed by workers. In addition, the activities of "No Raw Materials Requisition Day" should not be limited to those departments that only use raw materials for processing, and its scope should be wider. For example, the employees of Beijing Public Transport Company have been discussing and formulating a "No Fuel Requisition Day" plan since September 22, and it is estimated that they can save more than 23,000 liters of diesel and 2,193 liters of gasoline for the country by the end of the year. The No. 11 coal truck team plans to complete 15 "No Fuel Requisition Days" by the end of the year. This experience is the same as "No Raw Materials Requisition Day" in nature and content. If all transportation and units that use various fuels can also carry out this activity, they will definitely save a lot of fuel for the country.

It must also be stated here that is the activity of "No Raw Materials Requisition Day" only needed when raw materials are seriously wasted? Of course not. The technical level and management level of our enterprises are constantly advancing, and the possibility of saving raw materials always exists, and the saving potential in enterprises is never exhausted, so the work of saving raw materials should also be uninterrupted. This requires all enterprises to quickly and widely promote the experience of "No Raw Materials Requisition Day." Promoting this experience is a huge political and ideological education work. Workers can only act and contribute their labor and wisdom when they fully understand the full significance of this experience. Party committees, administrations, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations in various enterprises should deeply publicize the benefits of "No Raw Materials Requisition Day" to workers and overcome various ideological obstacles; trade union organizations should fully mobilize and organize workers to study and promote this experience, help workers formulate plans, and include this plan as one of the conditions for labor emulation. The administrative departments of enterprises should organize management personnel to help workers solve technical and other difficulties in promoting this experience, and should promptly reward workers, groups, and workshops with achievements.

On July 13th this year, the first red flag of "No Raw Materials Requisition Day" was planted on the lathe of the first group of turners in the metalworking workshop of Shenyang Transformer Factory. Zhang Qinggui, the leader of the trade union group of the first group, attended the Liaoning Provincial Conference of Youth Socialist Construction Activists in September and, on behalf of the workers of the entire group, put forward a proposal to youth workers throughout the province to promote this experience. It is hoped that the leading staff and workers of all enterprises across the country will hear their voice and respond to their initiative. In order to save huge amounts of wealth for the country, in order to accelerate the speed of socialist construction, strive to plant the red flag of "No Raw Materials Requisition Day" in all factories and workshops as soon as possible.

    广泛开展“不领原材料工作日”的活动
    重达
    组织广大工人群众在生产过程中节省原材料，永远是一切工业生产部门的经常工作。这不仅仅因为节约是社会主义企业的重要管理原则；而且因为原材料费用在工业产品成本中占很大的比重（有时竟占到百分之七十到八十五），严格节约原材料，能够使我们利用同样数量的原材料生产出更多的产品，能够降低产品的成本，促进劳动生产率的提高。反之，凡是不重视节约原材料的企业，就不能全面完成国家计划，产品成本一定是很高的。
    今年，各企业开展了全面的节约工作，在节约原材料方面收到了一定的效果。鞍山钢铁公司的职工，由三月中旬至九月中旬，搜集了六万八千多吨废钢铁、有色金属和稀有金属，有很多已被利用来代替好料进行生产；各轧钢厂的工人用长期堆在仓库里的钢号不清、尺寸太短的钢坯轧成钢轨，并且已处理了四万多吨。天津自行车厂压材工段的工人今年利用价值五万二千八百元的呆滞材料和废料，加工成为价值七万四千八百元的产品，节省了好钢材一百一十吨。他们还研究用自制的材料来代替某些进口材料，全年可为国家节省外汇四十九万多元。他们不断改进技术，把材料利用率提高到百分之九十四，并且降低了废品率。全国各生产企业中涌现了数百个“青年节约队”，展开了搜集废料、利用呆滞材料以及在生产过程中节省材料的各项活动。但是，就整个节约原材料的情况看来，这项工作还不能令人满意。各企业还没有把所有的废料搜集和利用起来；呆滞材料处理得很迟缓，在保证产品质量条件下利用代用品的工作做得很不好；生产过程中的节约原材料的工作还缺乏经常性。为了保证全面完成国家生产计划和增产节约计划，各企业的领导工作人员应该迅速地克服这些缺点，把节约原材料的工作进一步地组织起来。
    国营沈阳变压器厂金工车间学习苏联的“不领原材料工作日”的节约经验，是一个值得重视的组织职工节约原材料的办法。
    所谓“不领原材料工作日”，就是工人在生产过程中进行全面的、经常的、点滴的节约，在一个月中抽出一天的时间，利用节省下来的原材料为国家生产各种产品。这一先进经验最早出现于苏联莫斯科“巴黎公社”制鞋厂，发起人是这个厂的生产队长珂拉贝丽尼科娃。她在一九五○年三月提出这个倡议，立即得到全车间、全厂工人的响应，并且很快地传到苏联各工业生产部门。实行“不领原材料工作日”的结果，给国家节约了千百万卢布。“巴黎公社”制鞋厂在一年内所节省下的原材料，就可以多生产十七万双鞋子。由于对国家的巨大贡献，珂拉贝丽尼科娃在一九五一年荣获斯大林奖金，并且被选为最高苏维埃代表。
    沈阳变压器厂金工车间推广“不领原材料工作日”获得了显著的成绩。第一工段车工一组于今年七月在党委领导下开始学习这一经验，到九月底已实现了三十四个“不领原材料工作日”，用废料头生产了一千零三十五件成品。现在，全厂已有九个车间三十五个小组推广了这一经验。沈阳低压开关厂金工车间学习了沈阳变压器厂金工车间的做法，只是二工段车工第一、二组由九月五日到十月初，就做了三十个“不领原材料工作日”，为国家节省了三千三百八十二元。
    一切企业的领导工作人员，绝不能低估这一先进经验的作用。“不领原材料工作日”是广大工人群众爱护国家财富、发扬社会主义劳动热情、自觉地厉行节约的豪迈行动。“不领原材料工作日”最积极的意义在于它明确而响亮地号召全体工人在劳动中为祖国建设事业贡献更大的力量，通过这一具体的目标，组织工人进行全面的、经常的节约材料的活动，尤其重要的是动员工人不但要节省材料，而且要迅速地把节省下来的材料用到生产上去。完成一个“不领原材料工作日”不是轻而易举的，工人必须注意一点一滴的节省，既要节省主要材料也要节省辅助材料，既要时刻计算节约的数量，又要充分考虑怎样才能用到生产上。这样，工人就势必在生产中进行更复杂的、能够提高企业管理水平的各种活动：严格执行和降低材料消耗定额，使企业管理人员迅速找到先进的、有科学根据的材料计划消耗定额，改变落后的定额，这正是加强计划管理所必备的条件；为了节省原材料，工人就会自觉地、积极地研究、学习新的技术，不断改进操作方法，发明和创造各种先进的工具，以提高技术水平，为降低材料消耗量和消灭废品而进行创造性的劳动，这正是加强技术管理的最可靠的基础；通过上述两方面的成就，可以大大地降低产品成本。这说明，广泛开展“不领原材料工作日”的活动，不但可以把生产中节约原材料的工作全面地组织起来，而且是发动工人群众保证全面完成国家计划的一个有效措施。
    推行“不领原材料工作日”的时候，企业的领导工作人员应注意根据企业的具体情况扩大其活动范围，不要把这一先进经验僵化了，要从各方面使这一萌芽生长、壮大。本来，在“不领原材料工作日”里所需要的原材料即是在生产过程中节省下来的，但是在目前各企业积压很多的废料和呆滞材料，而某些产品尚感原料不足的情况下，就应该把利用废料、呆料、代用材料等都算作“不领原材料工作日”的活动，这会给国家创造大批的财富。江西萍乡矿务局王家源矿四号井下山回采区，在九月中旬推行了“不领新料工作日”，在安全生产的前提下，曾连续五天完全利用旧坑木进行生产，节省新坑木二十三点五立方公尺，价值一千二百多元，这种做法是值得表扬的。依照“不领原材料工作日”的要求，应该利用节约的材料为国家生产完整的商品，如像“巴黎公社”制鞋厂那样。这在某些企业中是完全可能的，如轻工业各生产单位及冶金、化学、建筑材料等企业部门。上海第一钢厂青年节约队就曾在九月十七日，利用假日，利用搜集来的废钢铁为国家炼出了一炉钢。当然，对某些企业来说，要想完全用节省下来的原材料生产出成品来是有困难的。如大型钢材、机床、机车、轮船等等。在这样的企业里，应该发动工人利用“不领原材料工作日”为国家生产各种部件或零件。沈阳低压开关厂曾根据冲床和剪床能力大、需要材料多这一特点，提出展开“不领原材料工作号”的活动，受到工人热烈的欢迎。此外，也不要把“不领原材料工作日”的活动局限在那些只是利用原材料进行加工的部门，它的范围还应该更广。例如，北京市公共汽车公司的职工自九月二十二日起，讨论和制定了“不领燃料工作日”的计划，预计到年底可为国家节省柴油二万三千多公升、汽油二千一百九十三公升。十一号煤汽车组准备到年底完成十五个“不领燃料工作日”。这一经验在性质和内容上是和“不领原材料工作日”一样的，如果一切交通运输和使用各种燃料的单位也能进行这种活动，一定能为国家节省大量的燃料。
    在这里还必须说明一点，即“不领原材料工作日”的活动是否只有在原材料浪费严重的情况下才需要呢？当然不是。我们企业的技术水平和管理水平是不断地前进着的，节约原材料的可能一直是有的，企业中的节约潜力是永远挖不尽的，因此节省原材料的工作也应是永不间断的。这就要求各企业迅速而广泛地推广“不领原材料工作日”这一经验。推行这个经验，是一项巨大的政治思想教育工作，工人们只有充分了解这一经验的全部意义的时候才能行动起来，献出自己的劳动和智慧。各企业中的党委、行政、工会、青年团组织，要深入向工人宣传“不领原材料工作日”的好处，克服各种思想障碍；工会组织应充分发动和组织工人学习、推广这一经验，帮助工人制定计划，并把这一计划列为劳动竞赛的条件之一。企业行政部门要把管理人员组织起来，帮助工人解决推广这一经验的技术和其他方面的困难，对有成绩的工人、小组、车间应及时给予奖励。
    今年七月十三日，“不领原材料工作日”的第一面红旗插上了沈阳变压器厂金工车间车工一组的车床。一组的工会小组长张庆贵在九月间出席辽宁省青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的时候，代表全组工人向全省青年工人提出推广这一经验的建议。希望全国所有企业的领导工作人员和工人都听到他们的声音，响应他们的倡议。为了给国家节省巨量的财富，为了加速社会主义建设速度，争取早日把“不领原材料工作日”的红旗插遍所有的工厂、车间。
