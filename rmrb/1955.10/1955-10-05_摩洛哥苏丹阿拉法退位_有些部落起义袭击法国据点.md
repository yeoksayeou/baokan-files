Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 4th: According to TASS, Paris Radio reported that Moroccan Sultan Arafa submitted a statement to the French Governor-General on October 1, announcing his abdication. Arafa then went to the Tangier International Zone. The broadcast said that Arafa had transferred the Sultan's power to his cousin, Abdul Hafid.

It can be seen from reports in Parisian newspapers that the political situation in Morocco has not improved as a result of Sultan Arafa's abdication. According to the plan for resolving the Moroccan issue, which was drafted by the French government and the leaders of the Moroccan nationalists after negotiations in Aix-les-Bains, the current Sultan Arafa was to be abolished and a three-member Regency Council established. However, due to opposition from certain groups in France, the Regency Council has not yet been established.

Arafa's decision to transfer the Sultan's power to Hafid was met with fierce opposition from the Moroccan Independence Party and the Democratic Independence Party. Both parties said that the decision violated the agreements reached during the Franco-Moroccan negotiations in Aix-les-Bains and during consultations with former Sultan Yusuf in Antsirabe. The Independence Party said that the decision was the result of pressure from the colonial organization "supporting the French presence in the Moroccan federation." The party protested against "the intolerable behavior of some French extremists and the attitude of the French authorities in Morocco."

The situation in Morocco is further complicated by the fact that in the central mountainous region of the Atlas Mountains near the border of Spanish Morocco, and in other areas, some tribes have begun to revolt, carrying out attacks on French military strongholds. The French military command has dispatched new troops and is using aircraft, tanks, and artillery to deal with these tribes.

    摩洛哥苏丹阿拉法退位  
    有些部落起义袭击法国据点
    新华社四日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：巴黎电台报道，摩洛哥苏丹阿拉法十月一日向法国总督递交了一份声明，宣布退位。阿拉法随即前往丹吉尔国际区。广播说，阿拉法已经把苏丹的权力让给他的表兄弟阿卜杜勒·哈菲德。
    从巴黎报纸消息中可以看出，摩洛哥的政局并没有因为苏丹阿拉法的放弃王位而好转。按照法国政府同摩洛哥民族主义者的领袖在艾克斯—勒—巴恩谈判以后拟订的解决摩洛哥问题的计划，要废除现苏丹阿拉法，而建立一个由三人组成的王位委员会。但是，由于法国的某些集团反对这个计划，王位委员会到现在还没有建立起来。
    阿拉法把苏丹权力移交给哈菲德的决定遭到摩洛哥独立党和独立民主党的激烈反对。这两个党都说，这个决定是违反在艾克斯—勒—巴恩举行法摩谈判时以及在安齐拉贝同前苏丹优素福磋商时达成的协议。独立党说，这个决定是“支持法国驻留在摩洛哥联合会”这个殖民组织施压力的结果。这个党抗议“一些法国极端主义分子的令人不能容忍的行为，并且抗议摩洛哥法国当局的态度”。
    摩洛哥的局势还由于下列情形而复杂化：在亚特拉斯山脉中部山区靠近西（班牙）属摩洛哥边境的地方以及在其他一些地区，有些部落开始起义，它们对法国的军事据点实行了一些袭击。法军司令部派出新的军队，并且用飞机、坦克和大炮来对付这些部落。
