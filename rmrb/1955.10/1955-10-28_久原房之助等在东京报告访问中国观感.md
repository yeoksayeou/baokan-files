    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 27th. The National Council for the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations between Japan and China and Japan and the Soviet Union held a report meeting in Tokyo on the 22nd. Kuzuhara Fusanosuke, who had just returned from a visit to China, said at the meeting: "I visited various parts of China and saw that China is indeed united, especially in the unity of the people's hearts. Everyone trusts the leadership of the government and lives and works in peace and contentment." He believes that China's current vitality and new atmosphere will never decline. Kuzuhara refuted the idea that some people suspect that China will invade Japan after completing its domestic construction. He said: "Absolutely not, we can be completely assured of this."
    Kuzuhara also said, "Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou received us with very kind attitudes." He said: "We talked with Chairman Mao twice." He repeatedly praised Chairman Mao for making people feel close and respectable. He believes that Chairman Mao is indeed a great leader.
    Kitajima Yoshihiko, head of the Japanese delegation of six major cities to China, also gave a report at the meeting. Kitajima said: "Even the China we, the Democratic Party members, have seen is peace-loving and especially friendly to Japan." He expressed the hope that a place to live would be prepared for the Chinese commercial representative agency in the Tokyo Industrial Hall, which is about to be built. He said: "A hundred words are not as good as one action, we must promote Sino-Japanese trade with concrete actions."
    Tsukui Tatsuo, a member of the Japanese delegation of six major cities to China and a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, also expressed his views at the meeting. He said: "I am one of the most right-wing people. The China I imagined in the past and the China I saw this time are too far apart." He said: "Today's China is carrying out extensive reforms in both political and economic terms."

    久原房之助等在东京报告访问中国观感
    新华社东京二十七日电　日本恢复日中日苏邦交国民会议二十二日在东京举行报告会。不久前才从中国访问回来的久原房之助在会上说：我到中国各地去参观，看到中国确实是统一起来了，尤其是民心的统一。大家都信任政府的领导而安居乐业。他认为中国现在的元气和新气象永久不会衰落下去。久原反驳了有人怀疑中国在完成了国内建设以后会侵略日本的想法。他说：绝对没有这回事，这点我们完全可以放心。
    久原又说，“毛主席和周总理都以很亲切的态度接见了我们。”他说：我们同毛主席谈了两次。他一再称赞毛主席使人感到亲近和可敬。他认为，毛主席确实是一位伟大的领导者。
    日本六大城市访华代表团团长北岛义彦也在会上作了报告。北岛说：就是我们民主党人所看到的中国，也是爱好和平的，尤其对日本是友好的。他表示希望在即将修建的东京产业会馆里面为中国商务代表机构准备下居住的地方。他说：百言不如一行，我们必须以具体的行动来促进中日贸易。
    日本六大城市访华代表团团员、东京都议会议员津久井龙雄也在会上发表观感。他说：我是站在最右翼的一个人。我过去所想像的中国和我这次所看到的中国，是相差太远了。他说：今天的中国，无论在政治上或经济上，都在进行着广泛的改革。
