Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a grand reception on the morning of the 7th to welcome Mr. Nenni, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, Chairman of the Italian National Peace Council, and General Secretary of the Italian Socialist Party, who is visiting China.

The auditorium of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was filled with people from all walks of life in the capital. Among them were members of the National Committee of the CPPCC in Beijing, deputies to the National People's Congress in Beijing, personnel from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and the Beijing Committee of the CPPCC and Beijing organizations of various democratic parties, totaling more than a thousand people.

At 9:30 AM, Mr. Nenni and his wife, his daughter Luciana Tomasi, Italian Socialist Party Executive Committee member Panzieri, and Italian National Food Workers' Union Secretary Onsanelli, accompanied by Guo Moruo, Li Jishen, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, and Zhang Bojun, walked onto the stage. The attendees of the welcoming meeting applauded warmly.

Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC and Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, delivered a speech first, expressing warm and heartfelt welcome and respect to Mr. Nenni and his Italian friends who came to China with him. Guo Moruo said: Mr. Nenni is an outstanding social activist of the Italian people, a heroic fighter in the anti-fascist struggle for many years, and a powerful organizer of the world peace movement. Mr. Nenni's visit to China brings the friendship of the Italian people to the Chinese people, and his rich experience in anti-fascist struggle and the defense of the peace movement, which will greatly contribute to strengthening the friendship between the Chinese and Italian peoples.

Guo Moruo said: The Chinese people have long held respect and friendship for the great Italian people. Italy is the birthplace of ancient Roman civilization and modern European civilization. As early as two thousand years ago, Chinese and Roman cultures had contact. In particular, in 1275, that is, 680 years ago, Marco Polo, the great son of the Italian people, came to China and lived in China for twenty years. He brought the culture of the Italian people, and when he returned to Italy, he also brought Chinese culture to Italy. His "Travels of Marco Polo," dictated in prison in his later years, is a popular book in the world, a milestone in recording the friendship between the Chinese and Italian peoples, and also a medium for promoting East-West transportation since then. The great Italian people have produced many great sons, such as Dante, Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, the giants of the Renaissance, who are all familiar and loved by the Chinese people. Their works have long been introduced to China. The Chinese people have been influenced by the culture created by the Italian people and have always held respect for the great Italian people.

Guo Moruo finally hoped that Mr. Nenni would offer more criticism and opinions during his visit, and believed that he would bring the culture and friendship of the Italian people to China even more richly than Marco Polo.

Mr. Nenni then delivered a speech at the meeting (full text on page 3). He talked about his impressions after coming to China and many important issues in the current international situation. During his speech, warm and lasting applause echoed throughout the venue. At the end of his speech, the entire audience stood up, and the applause lasted for a long time.

Guo Moruo finally stood up and thanked Mr. Nenni for his speech. He said: We fully agree with Mr. Nenni's excellent views. He hoped that Mr. Nenni would bring back the Chinese people's sincere friendship to the Italian people and wished the Italian people happiness and prosperity.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a banquet at noon on the 7th to welcome Mr. Nenni, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, Chairman of the Italian National Peace Council, and General Secretary of the Italian Socialist Party, and his wife, Mr. Infeld, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council and Polish physicist, and his wife, Mr. Pritt, Chairman of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and President of the British Peace Committee, and his wife, and Mrs. Blum of Belgium, Standing Committee member and Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Peace Council. Before the banquet, Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China and Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, had a friendly conversation with them.

Mr. Nenni's daughter Luciana Tomasi, Italian Socialist Party Executive Committee member Panzieri, and Italian National Food Workers' Union Secretary Onsanelli were also invited to attend the banquet.

At the beginning of the banquet, Soong Ching Ling, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, delivered a speech first. On behalf of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, she expressed a warm welcome to the close friends of the Chinese people who have come to visit China. She said: Your names, inseparable from peace and progress, are very familiar to the Chinese people. You have not only made outstanding contributions to defending world peace, but have also been enthusiastic in promoting friendly relations between the people of all countries and the Chinese people. Therefore, you are respected by the Chinese people.

Soong Ching Ling said: Our wishes and purposes are the same as yours. Let us join hands and strive together for the greatest interests of mankind today, to ease international tensions and strive for lasting world peace.

At the banquet, Mr. Nenni, Mr. Pritt, Mr. Infeld, and Mrs. Blum delivered speeches one after another. They all expressed their deep friendship with the Chinese people and proposed a toast to the health of the great Chinese people and their great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, and to the consolidation and development of the cause of world peace.

Accompanying the guests at the banquet were Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Peng Zhen, Shen Junru, He Xiangning, Chen Shutong, and Zhang Bojun, Vice-Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and standing committee members in Beijing, as well as heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations.

    政协全国委员会盛会欢迎南尼
    并欢宴南尼、英费尔德、普里特、布伦姆夫人
    新华社七日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会在七日上午举行盛大欢迎会，欢迎来中国访问的世界和平理事会副主席、意大利全国和平理事会主席、意大利社会党总书记南尼先生。
    在中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会大礼堂内，坐满了首都各界人士。他们当中有在京的中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员，在京的全国人民代表大会代表，各民主党派、各人民团体以及中国人民政协北京市委员会和各民主党派北京市组织的人员等共一千多人。
    九时三十分，南尼先生和他的夫人，他的女儿卢契安娜·托马西，意大利社会党执行委员潘齐埃里和意大利全国食品工会书记昂萨奈利，由郭沫若、李济深、李维汉、陈叔通、章伯钧陪同走上主席台。参加欢迎大会的人们热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若首先致词，向南尼先生和同他一起来中国访问的意大利的朋友们表示热烈的衷心的欢迎和敬意。郭沫若说：南尼先生是意大利人民的杰出的社会活动家，多少年来一直是反法西斯斗争的英勇战士，是世界和平运动的有力的组织者。南尼先生到中国来，带来了意大利人民对中国人民的友谊，带来了他从事反法西斯斗争和保卫和平运动的丰富的经验，这对于加强中意两国人民的友谊将会有很大贡献。
    郭沫若说：中国人民对伟大的意大利人民很早以前就怀着敬意和友谊。意大利是古代罗马文明和近代欧洲文明的发祥地，早在两千多年前，中国文化和罗马文化已有了接触。特别是一二七五年，即距今六百八十年以前，意大利人民的伟大的儿子马哥波罗到中国来，在中国住了二十年之久，他带来了意大利人民的文化，在他回到意大利的时候，也把中国的文化带到意大利去。他晚年在狱中口授的“马哥波罗游记”是在世界上烩炙人口的一部著作，是纪录中意两国人民友谊的里程碑，也是从那时以后促进东西方交通的媒介。伟大的意大利人民中产生了不少伟大的儿子，如文艺复兴期中的巨匠但丁、达·芬奇、米开朗琪罗、拉斐尔，都是中国人民所熟悉和热爱的。他们的作品早就介绍到中国来了。中国人民曾经受到意大利人民创造出来的文化的影响，对伟大的意大利人民向来是怀抱着敬意的。
    郭沫若最后希望南尼先生在参观访问时多多提出批评和意见，并相信他会比马哥波罗更丰富地把意大利人民的文化和友谊带到中国来。
    南尼先生接着在会上作了演说（全文见第三版）。他谈到了来中国后的观感，谈到了目前国际局势中的许多重要问题。在他讲话时，会场上不断响起热烈的经久不息的掌声。在他演说结束时，全场起立，掌声经久不息。
    郭沫若最后起立表示感谢南尼先生的演说。他说：我们完全同意南尼先生的卓越的见解。他希望南尼先生把中国人民对意大利人民的亲切的友谊带回去，并且祝意大利人民幸福和繁荣。
    新华社七日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会在七日中午举行宴会，欢迎世界和平理事会副主席、意大利全国和平理事会主席、意大利社会党总书记南尼和他的夫人，世界和平理事会副主席、波兰物理学家英费尔德和他的夫人，国际民主法律工作者协会主席、英国和平委员会会长普里特和他的夫人，世界和平理事会常务委员兼书记处书记比利时的布伦姆夫人。在宴会以前，中华人民共和国国务院总理、中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会主席周恩来和他们作了亲切的谈话。
    南尼先生的女儿卢契安娜·托马西、意大利社会党执行委员潘齐埃里和意大利全国食品工会书记昂萨奈利也应邀出席了宴会。
    宴会开始时，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席宋庆龄首先致词。她代表中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会，向来到中国访问的中国人民亲密的朋友们表示热烈的欢迎。她说：你们同和平、进步不可分的名字，是中国人民所非常熟悉的。你们不但对保卫世界和平有着卓越的贡献，而且一直热心于促进各国人民同中国人民之间的友好关系。因此，你们受到了中国人民的尊敬。
    宋庆龄说：我们和你们的愿望和目的是共同的。让我们携起手来为着人类当前最大的利益，缓和国际紧张局势争取世界持久和平而共同奋斗吧。
    宴会上，南尼先生、普里特先生、英费尔德先生和布伦姆夫人相继致词。他们都表达了对中国人民的深厚友谊，并提议为伟大的中国人民及其伟大领袖毛泽东主席的身体健康、为世界和平事业的巩固和发展而干杯。
