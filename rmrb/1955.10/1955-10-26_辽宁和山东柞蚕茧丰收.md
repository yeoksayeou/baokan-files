Liaoning and Shandong, the main producing areas of tussah silkworm in the country, have achieved a bumper harvest of silkworm cocoons this year. It is estimated that the cocoon production in the two places will be more than 6.7 billion, an increase of 1.7 times compared with last year. The main reasons for this year's bumper harvest are the attention paid by the local Party and government departments, the technical guidance of the agricultural departments to the silkworm farmers; in addition to the normal climate this year, the good growth of oak leaves, and the normal development of tussah silkworms.

Tussah silk and tussah silk fabrics are one of China's important export commodities, with great economic value. At present, Shandong is working intensively on purchasing, and Liaoning is actively preparing for purchasing.

    辽宁和山东柞蚕茧丰收
    全国柞蚕主要产区的辽宁、山东两地，今年蚕茧获得了大丰收。估计两地的茧产量在六十七亿粒以上，比去年增产了一点七倍。今年丰收的原因主要是由于当地党政部门的重视，农业部门对蚕农的生产技术指导；再加上今年气候正常，柞叶生长良好和柞蚕发育正常。
    柞蚕丝、柞绸是我国重要出口商品之一，经济价值很大。目前山东已在紧张地进行收购工作，辽宁正在积极准备收购中。（袁峰）
