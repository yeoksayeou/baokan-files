    Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region's First Hydropower Station Completed
    Jiamusi Paper Mill's Various Projects Under Tense Construction

    This newspaper's Urumqi dispatch on the 6th: The first modern hydropower station in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the state-owned Ulabo Hydropower Station, has been successfully built and officially put into production with an opening ceremony held on October 5th.

    This hydropower station is built on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains, more than ten kilometers away from Urumqi. Most of the equipment is produced in Tianjin, Shenyang, and other places in China. The generator and transformer are equipped with reliable maintenance equipment. Its power generation can provide lighting for a modern city with a population of 770,000. The commissioning of the Ulabo Hydropower Station provides Urumqi's industrial and mining enterprises and people of all ethnic groups with a more abundant supply of inexpensive power.

    On October 5th, the day of the opening ceremony, responsible party and government officials from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and Urumqi attended to offer their congratulations.

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 7th: On the construction site of the large-scale Jiamusi Paper Mill, dozens of tall buildings such as the copper mesh factory building and the thermal power plant building, and a concrete bridge have already been erected. Most of these buildings were started last winter and in May of this year. Next to these buildings, more than twenty projects are under tense construction.

    This year is the most intense year for the construction of the Jiamusi Paper Mill, with a total of forty projects starting construction successively. In the fourth quarter of this year, the copper mesh factory attached to the plant will be completed and put into production. The thermal power station will also begin generating electricity by the end of this year.

    新疆维吾尔自治区第一座水力发电站建成
    佳木斯造纸厂各项工程紧张施工
    本报乌鲁木齐六日电　新疆维吾尔自治区第一座现代化水力发电站——国营乌拉泊水电站已经建设成功，在十月五日举行开工典礼，正式投入生产。
    这座水电站建设在天山北麓，离乌鲁木齐市十多公里的地方，设备绝大部分都是我国天津、沈阳等地的产品。发电机和变压器都有可靠的维护设备。它的发电量可供一个有七十七万人口的现代化城市照明之用。乌拉泊水电站投入生产，使乌鲁木齐市的工矿企业和各族居民得到了更充足的廉价电源。
    十月五日举行开工典礼这天，新疆维吾尔自治区和乌鲁木齐市的党政负责人都到会祝贺。
    据新华社哈尔滨七日电　规模宏大的佳木斯造纸厂的建筑场地里，已经矗立起铜网厂房、热电站厂房等几十个高大的建筑物和一座混凝土大桥。这些建筑物大部分是在去年冬天和今年五月份动工的。在这些建筑物旁边，还有二十多项工程正在紧张施工。
    今年是佳木斯造纸厂建厂工程最紧张的一年，全厂共有四十项工程先后动工建设。在今年的第四季度，这个厂附设的铜网厂要完工投入生产。今年年底，热电站也要开始发电。
