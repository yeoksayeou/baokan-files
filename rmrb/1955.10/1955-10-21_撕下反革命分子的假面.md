Tear Off the Counter-Revolutionary's Mask
By our reporter, Fu Dong

A Fake Teacher
June 1951. The Tianjin Education Bureau was recruiting primary and secondary school teachers.

One day, a young man walked into the teacher recruitment committee office. He grandly took out a letter, which read:

"...According to our member Chen Qifang's written statement, her husband, Zhang Jintang, once studied at Guanghua University in Shanghai. Seeing your advertisement for teachers, we hereby introduce him and hope you will grant him an interview. Tianjin Light Industry Trade Union, North China Region Livestock Products Company, Fur Purchasing and Processing Plant Committee."

In addition to the union's seal, the union's secretary, Guan Dianbin, also affixed his personal seal.

Thus, Zhang Jintang entered the teacher training class very smoothly.

"I am a student from a school, and I have been studying in school from 1930 to 1950. I have never participated in any political parties, and my history is simple and clean," he often declared to those around him.

A week before graduation, more than a thousand students were busy confessing their historical problems. Zhang Jintang said that he used to study at Guanghua University in Shanghai, and when Shanghai was about to be liberated, he transferred to Taiwan University, and came to Tianjin after graduation.

"Why did you transfer from Shanghai to Taiwan? Who did you go to Taiwan to join? And why did you come to Tianjin from Taiwan? How did you come? What were your ideological conditions at the time?" the person in charge of the training class asked a series of questions.

Zhang Jintang did not explain these questions clearly. When asked to write a written material, he wrote it grandly like this:

"In the spring of 1949, I was studying in the second semester of my fourth year at Guanghua University in Shanghai. Before the Chinese People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, the Kuomintang reactionaries disbanded the universities in Shanghai and forbade students from living on campus. At that time, society was chaotic, and people lived in terror. I was afraid of being besieged and suffering from the disasters of war. At that time, I considered ways to leave Shanghai: one was to return to my hometown, one was to go to my father-in-law's place in Tianjin, and the other was to go to Xu Guoqing's place in Taiwan, hoping to transfer to Taiwan and complete the remaining half-year of study. I felt that I had studied hard for twenty years, and the purpose was to obtain a university degree as a stepping stone for future advancement. On the other hand, I was misled by the Kuomintang's vicious propaganda, saying that when the Communist Party came, young people would have to join the army, and the credits from the original university, especially social sciences, would not be recognized by the Communist Party, and they would have to start from scratch. Finally, the roads to my hometown and Tianjin were cut off, so I took a boat to Taiwan. After arriving in Taiwan, I was introduced by a fellow villager to work as a clerk in a cooperative, transcribing official documents. Later, I transferred to Taiwan University for half a year. After graduation, I returned to Tianjin because I wanted to marry my wife who lived in Tianjin. The travel expenses were sent to me by my father-in-law."

In this way, Zhang Jintang cleverly concealed his dirty and sinful history.

In fact, this person's name was Zhang Danqiu, a heinous spy. He joined the Kuomintang in 1940 and the Three People's Principles Youth League in 1941. After arriving at Guanghua University in Shanghai, he organized reactionary wall newspapers and secretly reported progressive students to the Central Unification Bureau (CC Clique). After Shanghai was besieged, this famous student spy went to the radio station to make anti-communist broadcasts, and participated in the "student troop慰劳," representing "troop 慰劳" students to receive reporters and called for "defending Shanghai." Because of his active anti-communism, in May 1949, the Shanghai Municipal Headquarters of the Three People's Principles Youth League sent him to Taiwan by plane. After arriving in Taiwan, he continuously published reactionary articles in the newspapers. In November of the same year, he entered the "Central Party Headquarters Party and Government Staff Training Class" (officially called "Ministry of National Defense Technical Training Class") hosted by the spy bosses Chiang Ching-kuo and Tang Zong for training. Zhang Danqiu studied shooting, disguise, enemy situation research, guerrilla warfare, communication methods, psychological warfare, criticism of communism, and interrogation and counter-interrogation courses. He studied very well and was highly valued by the spy bosses. Tang Zong had personally talked to him several times. Tang Zong told him that his social relations in Tianjin were very good, and he decided to send him back. At the graduation ceremony, Zhang Danqiu delivered a speech on behalf of all the trained spies. Chiang Kai-shek was originally going to attend that ceremony in person, but he didn't come due to a temporary matter. However, all the famous spy bosses such as Mao Sen and Mao Renfeng attended and gave speeches. When Zhang Danqiu was about to leave Taiwan, Tang Zong personally said to him: "We are preparing to have you set up a radio station in Tianjin. You should first return to Tianjin to understand the situation, improve your relations, and then come back with a radio station."

The head teacher of the training class read Zhang Jintang's fabricated grand historical material and couldn't make up his mind. He wrote in the review opinion column: "Consider and consider before distribution."

But later, when it came to really assigning jobs, the personnel office of the Education Bureau did not "consider and consider." They subjectively believed that they generally understood the situation of the trainees, and let them go to their jobs for detailed review. Some people even felt that: "Since they have been admitted, it is not good to not assign them a job." So, they muddled through and assigned this spy to the Tianjin Ninth District Central Cadre Spare-time School to teach.

What's even stranger is that the materials about Zhang Jintang were not sent to the school with Zhang Jintang himself, but were locked in the cabinet of the personnel office of the Education Bureau, and they remained locked for several years. The Education Bureau did not inform the school, nor did it contact the District Cultural and Education Section.

So Zhang Jintang swaggered into the school with the Education Bureau's letter of introduction. How "concerned" he was about all the teachers and students!

When Zhang Jintang arrived at the school, it happened to be National Day. The teachers gathered for dinner, and everyone talked about their feelings, and the new colleagues introduced themselves. Zhang Jintang said that he had studied in Shanghai and Taiwan, and also said that his life was corrupt when he was studying in Shanghai. He spent his time dancing and eating in restaurants and did not care about politics. He "sincerely" stated: "I am from Taiwan, and this may make people suspicious. This is a burden on my mind. But I believe that 'facts' and 'time' will prove my loyalty to the country." He took the initiative to confess his history to the director of teaching affairs, Dong Zhaohua, and said that he would like to make a public confession to all the teachers when he had the opportunity. At every self-criticism meeting, he always said "humbly": "I don't have a mass viewpoint, and I don't often contact everyone. This is a big shortcoming. I hope everyone will criticize me more."

When working, he was really "active and serious." Every morning, he rode his bike to school before dawn, and he didn't leave school until ten o'clock at night. When preparing lessons, he looked for reference books and asked teachers for advice. His notes were very organized. The theme of each lesson and the teaching steps were clearly written. The director of teaching affairs praised him and called on the teachers to learn from him. The director of teaching affairs often consulted him on issues related to literature and history courses and adopted his opinions. In the summer vacation of 1952, he voluntarily gave the students two months of supplementary lessons.

In addition to carefully studying his professional work, Zhang Jintang often helped teachers with weak abilities to prepare lessons.

He never said idle words. Some teachers were dissatisfied with the leaders because of salary issues and said strange things behind their backs. When he found out, he criticized them unceremoniously, "If you have any opinions, you can directly raise them with the leaders. It is wrong to talk behind people's backs like this." He also said: "I don't care about how much I am paid! If you give me money, you give me money. If you don't give me money, it doesn't matter. Why should I talk about price when I am serving the people!"

He "cared" about the progress of his comrades. When he saw the female teacher Sun Shuzhi, he asked "kindly": "Why don't you join the Communist Youth League?" When Sun Shuzhi told him that she was over the age to join the League, he encouraged her, saying: "Then you can strive to join the Party!" At the life self-criticism meeting, he said to the director of teaching affairs very "sincerely": "You are very capable in doing things, but you are a bit rough and not close enough to the masses." He said to the teacher Zhang Dawen (a member of the Communist Youth League): "You are active and enthusiastic in your work, but you are still a bit impatient."

Not only about work, but also about the lives of his comrades, he was "concerned." Sun Shuzhi was twenty-seven or eight years old and did not have a lover, so he was looking for someone for her everywhere. When he saw that his brother-in-law had a classmate, Xu Zuohua, who was very suitable, he enthusiastically introduced them and invited the two people to meet at his home for dinner. Afterwards, he often asked Sun Shuzhi: "Do you see each other often? Do you communicate often?" When the director of teaching affairs couldn't find a house, he said that his father-in-law's house had empty rooms.

He never haggled about work. When he was being transferred, he was asked for his opinion, and he said: "I obey the organization's decision."

When salaries were evaluated in 1952, Zhang Jintang was rated the highest.

During the ideological remolding movement, he took the lead in self-criticism. He told the set of lies he had fabricated again. When the teachers heard it, they all felt that it was reasonable. The director of teaching affairs, Dong Zhaohua, even thought: "Zhang Jintang has already been reviewed in the teacher training class, so the Education Bureau must have assigned him here because there was no problem. Moreover, the police station has not come to investigate, so there must be no problem."

In fact, there were many things in his speech that should have been suspected. For example, first, he said that one of the main reasons he went to Taiwan was because he was influenced by the Kuomintang's reactionary propaganda, saying how terrible the Communist Party was. But after staying in Taiwan for a year, he was anxious to return to Tianjin. Didn't he still be afraid of the Communist Party at this time? Second, he found a job immediately after arriving in Taiwan! This is not the situation encountered by ordinary students. Third, Taiwan restricts young people from leaving the country, and the procedures are very troublesome, but when he talked about leaving Taiwan for Hong Kong, he said very easily: "I bought a boat ticket and got on the boat casually, without any procedures." What was going on?

But few people suspected these problems. Everyone was deceived by his "activeness" on weekdays. The ideological remolding movement also allowed him to get by very easily.

Even on ordinary days, Zhang Jintang was not absolutely flawless, the problem was that the people around him were too 麻痹 [numb, careless]. Once, Zhang Jintang wrote a letter to the Tianjin Teachers College on behalf of all the teachers in the school, requesting to resume spare-time studies. After it was written, someone said that he wrote too vaguely, and he unintentionally blurted out: "In this day and age, it's better to be vague!" One day, a photo of a model worker was published in the Tianjin Daily. He unconsciously said: "Look, this person looks just like Chairman Chiang!" A teacher next to him deliberately said to him: "Yes! I heard that in Taiwan, anyone who mentions Chairman Chiang has to stand at attention!" He said: "Yes, Chairman Chiang, stand at attention!" As he said this, he made a standing at attention gesture, but immediately realized that something was wrong, and quickly changed his words: "What, Chiang Kai-shek's mother's fascist stuff!" Sometimes when he was excited, he would hum a song: "We want freedom, we want revenge!" Someone heard it and felt strange, and asked him what he was singing. He was very flustered, but he immediately pretended to be calm and said: "This is a very popular song in the rear during the War of Resistance Against Japan." In fact, this song was sung by spies who wanted to take revenge on the people. Once, the school was doing a general cleaning, and Zhang Jintang was responsible for wiping the light bulbs. As a result, the wires caught fire that night. If it hadn't been discovered early, it would have almost caused a big mess. After checking the cause, but when they heard that Zhang Jintang had wiped the light bulbs, no one suspected anything. Everyone was sure that the light bulb had short-circuited.

Our people were so 麻痹大意 [negligent], but the secret agents were not like this at all. Their every move was purposeful and planned. Let's take a look at Zhang Danqiu's confession after being arrested!

"I had a long-term lurking plan. I wanted to sneak into the government agencies first, get a foothold, and then start activities. My plan to infiltrate the school was to first consolidate my lurking, not to talk or act rashly, and to strive for the leadership's trust by pretending to be active. The methods I used were to get close to the leaders, win over the capable and more progressive people, and attack the less capable and more backward people in order to elevate myself, use small favors to make people feel good about me, and 麻痹 [lull] people's attention to me. For example, Dong Zhaohua of the school was the leader of the school, so I closely approached him. But I didn't blindly flatter him. I also offered some criticisms of his shortcomings, so that I would seem like a comrade; however, this was limited. The general purpose was to show my good intentions. Zhang Dawen was in charge of political study and ideological leadership in the cadre school. I was neither too close nor too far from him, and I said little idle talk. Shao Tiehan was the head of the trade union, and the leaders trusted him very much, so I often asked him for advice and won him over. Sun Shuzhi often reflected the situation of her colleagues at the meetings of activists. I thought she was the leader's spy, so I used the means of introducing her to a partner to win her over in order to consolidate my lurking.

I had a plan in advance for every movement, and I rushed to make a self-criticism. I said everything, but I didn't say that I was a spy. I said that my life was corrupt when I was studying in Shanghai. The purpose was to dress myself as a young man from a rich family, because most of the sons of rich families in school fooled around and didn't care about politics. I tried to use this to dilute my political color so as not to attract attention.

In political studies, I spoke very cautiously and enthusiastically. I could say a set of empty theories, and I always refuted the ideologically backward colleagues as much as possible. I could also tear off my face at the self-criticism meetings. I used this set of methods, and the leaders thought I was good and listed me as an activist.

In the classroom, I also said a set of empty theories, pretending to have a firm stance and correct views. I also pretended to be serious and responsible in my studies in order to deceive the students so that they couldn't see my spy tail. I voluntarily gave the students a summer vacation of supplementary lessons, and the purpose was to buy the students' favor and cover up my identity as a spy."

"Good Son-in-Law" "Good Husband"

At home, Zhang Jintang disguised himself as a "good son-in-law," a "good husband," and a "good brother-in-law." Every month, he handed over his salary to his father-in-law without even opening the package. He was considerate to his wife and encouraged her to strive to join the Party. He played a decisive role in his brother-in-law's joining the League. At that time, his mother-in-law did not agree with his brother-in-law joining the League, because she was afraid that he would be transferred elsewhere after joining the League. Zhang Jintang enlightened his mother-in-law and told his brother-in-law revolutionary principles. He said: "Joining the League is glorious, and you can better serve the people."

But Zhang Jintang would sometimes reveal his true colors. Once, he suddenly said: "The situation in China cannot be considered settled, and everything depends on the Third World War." On other occasions, Zhang Jintang often boasted about how good the United States was and instilled pro-American ideas in his family.

Many of his activities were discovered by his wife and brother-in-law. But they were unwilling to pursue them and did not report them to the organization. They even shielded him from a reactionary standpoint. When Zhang Jintang first arrived in Tianjin, he wrote a letter to Taiwan to ask for a certificate. Later, the certificate was sent, but it was a graduation certificate from the Department of Economics, not the Department of Law that he had said. His wife asked him: "What's going on? Did you really study in Taiwan?" Zhang Jintang replied: "I studied." And she did not ask any further questions. Soon, he went to the Tianjin Meili Photo Studio to take a student photo and sent it to Taiwan, asking them to send him another certificate from the Department of Law. His wife also knew about this, but she did not ask any further questions. After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement began, one morning, he saw a message about the arrest of spies and suddenly said: "The Kuomintang is training a large number of spies in Taiwan to carry out activities on the mainland." His wife and brother-in-law were stunned and asked: "Where did you receive training in Taiwan?" He immediately said angrily: "I didn't receive any training there. Don't talk nonsense! If I were a spy, I wouldn't have come to Tianjin!" His wife and brother-in-law didn't pursue the matter further. In the summer of 1951, a letter containing intelligence written by Zhang Jintang was exposed in a book and seen by his wife, who asked: "What is this?" He quickly said: "It's an arithmetic draft." His wife didn't say anything. Soon, his brother-in-law went to the Qinghe Woolen Mill for an internship, and he asked his brother-in-law to take a letter containing intelligence to Beijing to be sent to Hong Kong. He said to his brother-in-law: "This letter is for my friend in Hong Kong to lend me some money." He also said: "It's not good to always send letters to Hong Kong from Tianjin. Take it to Beijing to avoid attracting attention." He had a salary and lived a very prosperous life. Why did he want to borrow money from someone? Wasn't this very suspicious? But his brother-in-law only asked: "Why do you want someone to send you money?" And then took the letter away.

His wife and brother-in-law also discovered many suspicious things about him, but they still often told him about the situation of foreign exchange, prices, currency, exports and imports, and the relocation of industrial and mining enterprises. His wife also took documents home. All of these were used by him as intelligence to secretly report to the enemy. When Zhang Danqiu was arrested, the secret writing book he used for writing intelligence was also found.

In our country, there are indeed such people who consider all problems from an emotional point of view, so they do not suspect anything suspicious. But spies are not so emotional. They approach anyone in order to use them.

Let's take a look at Zhang Danqiu's confession:

"When I was trained by the bandit spies in Taiwan, I told the enemy that my father-in-law was a manager in a flour mill in Tianjin. He used to be an official and had some social connections that could cover up my activities. I also said that my father-in-law had an elder son who was a veteran cadre of the Eighth Route Army, and I could also use the relationship with his elder son to infiltrate the people's interior. I could sneak back to Tianjin under the guise of marrying my fiancée.

As soon as I entered the bandit spy training class, I wrote a letter to my fiancée saying that I had transferred to Taiwan University and would be able to return to Tianjin in half a year. When I was about to graduate, I wrote another letter asking my father-in-law to send me 400 Hong Kong dollars to Hong Kong for travel expenses. This was a smokescreen. I was afraid that people would suspect that I had so much money to return to China. At the same time, doing this would make my wife tell relatives and friends that I had returned to Tianjin, so everyone would not suspect me.

After I arrived in Tianjin, I paid attention to my father-in-law's family and his social connections. They were all pawns. I wanted to use them without them knowing, and in fact, I got a lot of important intelligence from their mouths.

In order to use them, I had to win their favor. My father-in-law had the traditional feudal ideas of China. He believed that there must be order between the elders and the younger in the family, and the children must be polite and abide by the rules. So I handed over my salary to him without opening the package, so that he would think that I was very honest and abided by the rules.

My father-in-law had many friends. Once, a friend came from Lanzhou to live in my father-in-law's house. I talked to him because I considered that when the international situation became tense in the future, I could use him to establish a base.

Another friend of my father-in-law was a capitalist. I thought that when the international situation became tense in the future, I could also use him to win over people from the business community, organize groups, and prepare for changes. I also wanted to use him to run transportation to Hong Kong for me.

I asked my brother-in-law to join the League because his joining the League would be beneficial to our family's status. In the future, he could also find a good job and learn a lot of secrets, which would be beneficial to me. I wanted to use my brother-in-law to establish an organization in the school. I asked my brother-in-law to often bring some classmates to my home to play. In this way, I could secretly look for some people, and I could also avoid outsiders paying attention to our family.

I encouraged my wife to be 'active' in order to join the Communist Party in the future and work for me."

This is the true face and thoughts of a spy.

Cannot Escape the Eyes of the People

The Tianjin Public Security Bureau one day received a letter. The letter read:

"...I came from Tianjin to Harbin. I am now working at the Yizhou Street Office of the People's Bank of China in Harbin.

During the nationwide suppression of counter-revolutionaries, our Harbin People's Bank also launched a study. I remembered a person. I hope you will accurately investigate and thoroughly inquire about the person's activities in order to eliminate the traitors and harm for the people.

One morning in Tianjin, I went from Donglou to Dagu Road to the Pingan Cinema and saw an acquaintance. When I called out his name, he looked at me in panic. I know that he did many bad things in Shanghai before liberation... These prove that he is a spy. Please investigate and suppress him. Especially since he returned from Taiwan this time, he is probably engaged in spy activities..."

The Public Security Bureau found Zhang Danqiu according to the address written in the letter. After detailed investigation, he was indeed a spy and was arrested.

The eyes of the masses are sharp. As long as the masses are mobilized, no matter how cunning the enemy is, he cannot escape.

    撕下反革命分子的假面
    本报记者　傅冬
    一个冒牌的教师
    一九五一年六月。天津教育局招聘中小学教员。
    一天，一个年轻人走进教师招聘委员会办公室。他大模大样地取出一封信，信上写着：
    “……据我会会员陈其芳书面声称，她的爱人张锦棠，曾肄业于上海市光华大学。兹见报载贵会刻正联合招聘教师，特此予以介绍，敬希惠赐洽谈为荷。天津轻工业工会华北区畜产公司皮毛收购加工厂委员会启”
    信上除盖了工会的图章外，工会的秘书关殿宾还盖了自己的私章。
    这个张锦棠就这样很顺当地进了师资学习班。
    “我是一个出身学校的学生，从一九三○年起到一九五○年都在学校念书，从来没参加过什么党派，我的历史是单纯清白的。”他常常对周围的人表白自己。
    临毕业前的一个星期，一千多学员忙着交代历史问题。张锦棠说，他以前在上海光华大学念书，上海临解放时转学到台湾大学，毕业后来天津。
    “你为什么由上海转学到台湾？上台湾是投奔谁的？又为什么从台湾来天津？怎样来的？当时的思想情况怎样？”学习班的负责人提出了一连串的问题。
    这些问题张锦棠都交代得不清楚。叫他写个书面材料，他就冠冕堂皇地这样写了：
    “一九四九年春天，我当时在上海光华大学四年级下学期读书。中国人民解放军渡江之前，上海各大学被国民党反动派解散，并禁止学生住校。当时社会混乱，人们生活在恐怖中，我怕围城遭受战争炮火的灾难。我当时考虑离开上海的办法：一是回家乡，一是到天津岳父处，另一个就是去台湾许国卿处，并希望能转读台湾，完成仅剩半年的学业。我觉得自己辛苦的念了二十年书，目的是在得到个大学毕业的资格，作为将来向上爬的本钱。另一方面误受了国民党的恶毒宣传，说共产党来了，青年人都要参军，原大学的学分，尤其是社会学科，共产党都不承认，还得从头念。最后家乡和天津的路断绝了，我就坐船去了台湾。到台湾后由同乡介绍到一个合作社作办事员，誊写公文。以后转到台湾大学念了半年。毕业以后，我因为要和住在天津的爱人结婚，就回天津了。路费是岳父寄给我的。”
    张锦棠就这样巧妙地掩盖了他的肮脏、罪恶的历史。
    实际上，这个人的名字叫张丹秋，是个罪大恶极的特务。他一九四○年加入国民党，一九四一年参加三青团。到上海光华大学以后，主办过反动壁报，向中统特务密告过进步学生。上海被围后，这个著名的学生特务去广播电台作反共广播，并参加“学生劳军”，代表“劳军”学生招待记者，号召“保卫上海”。因他反共积极，一九四九年五月上海市三青团团部用飞机把他送到台湾。到台湾后，不断地在报上发表反动文章，同年十一月入特务头子蒋经国和唐纵主持的“中央党部党政工作人员训练班”（对外称“国防部技术训练班”）受训。张丹秋在里面学习了射击术、化装术、敌情研究、游击作战、通讯方法、心理作战、共产主义批判和审讯与反审讯等课程。他学的成绩很好，很受特务头子们的重视。唐纵曾经亲自和他谈过几次话。唐纵对他说，他在天津的社会关系很好，决定派他回去。毕业典礼上，张丹秋代表所有的受训特务致答词。那次典礼，蒋介石原来要亲自参加的，因临时有事没有来。但所有出名的特务头子象毛森、毛人凤等都出席了，而且还讲了话。张丹秋临离开台湾时，唐纵又亲口对他说：“我们准备叫你在天津架设一部电台。你先回天津了解了解情况，把关系搞好了，再回来一趟带电台去。”
    学习班班主任看了张锦棠伪造的冠冕堂皇的历史材料，拿不定主意。他在审查意见栏里写道：“考虑考虑再分配”。
    但是后来到真的分配工作的时候，教育局人事室并没有“考虑考虑”，他们主观地认为学员的情况一般都了解了，让他们到工作岗位再详细审查吧。有人甚至还这样觉得：“既然收进来了，不分配工作，对本人不好讲。”于是稀里糊涂就把这个特务分配到天津市九区中心干部业余学校去教书。
    更可怪的是：有关张锦棠的材料并没有和张锦棠本人一块送到学校，而是锁到教育局人事室的柜子里去了，并且一锁就锁了几年。教育局也没向学校打招呼，也没同区文教科联系。
    于是张锦棠就大摇大摆地拿着教育局的介绍信进了学校。他对全校师生多么“关心”！
    张锦棠一到学校，正好是国庆节。教员们在一起聚餐，大伙谈感想，新同事作自我介绍。张锦棠说他在上海、台湾念过书，又说他在上海读书期间生活腐化，整天跳舞吃馆子，不过问政治。他“诚恳地”表示：“我是台湾来的，这可能就会被人怀疑。这是我思想上的一个包袱。但我相信‘事实’和‘时间’会证明我对国家的忠实。”他主动地找教导主任董兆华交代历史，并表示有机会时要向全体老师作一次公开交代。每次开检讨会，他总是“虚心地”说：“我没有群众观点，不常和大家联系，这是个很大的缺点。希望大家多批评。”
    工作时，他可真“积极认真”。每天早上天还不亮他就骑车去学校，夜里十点钟才离校回家。备课的时候，又找参考书，又找教员研究。笔记写得很有条理。每一课的主题和教学步骤都写得清清楚楚。教导主任表扬他，号召教员们向他学习。关于文史课程上的问题，教导主任常同他商量，采纳他的意见。一九五二年暑假，他自动给学员们补了两个月课。
    张锦棠除了自己仔细钻研业务外，还经常帮助能力弱的老师准备功课。
    他从不说闲话。有些教员因为工资问题，对领导不满，背后说怪话。他知道了，不客气地批评“有意见可以直接向领导提，这样背后说长论短是不对的。”又说：“评薪多少，我才不在乎呢！给钱就给钱，不给钱也没关系，为人民服务还讲什么价钱！”
    他“关心”同志们的进步。见到女教员孙淑芝就“亲切地”问：“你为什么不入团？”当孙淑芝告诉他入团年龄超过了，他还给打气说：“那可以争取入党嘛！”在生活检讨会上，他很“诚恳”地对教导主任说：“你作事很有办法，但有点粗枝大叶，不够接近群众。”对教员张大文（团员）说：“你工作积极热情，但还有点儿急躁情绪。”
    不但工作，就是同志们的生活，他也“关心”。孙淑芝二十七、八岁了，没有爱人，他就到处给她物色对象。见到他内弟有一个同学徐作华很合适，就热心给介绍，请两个人在他家见面吃饭。以后还不时地问孙淑芝：“你们常见面吗？常通信吗？”教导主任找不到房子，他说他岳父家有空房。
    对工作他从不讲价钱。调动工作的时候，问他意见，他说：“我服从组织决定。”
    一九五二年评薪时，张锦棠被评得最高。
    思想改造运动的时候，他带头检讨。他又把他编造的一套讲了一通。教员们一听，都觉说得合情合理。教导主任董兆华更认为：“张锦棠在师资学习班已经审查过了，一定是没有问题教育局才分配来的。而且派出所也没有来了解，一定是没有问题。”
    实际上，他的发言中有不少应该怀疑的地方。比方说，第一点，他说他去台湾的主要原因之一是受了国民党的反动宣传，说共产党怎么怎么可怕。但后来在台湾停了一年，就又急于要回天津，难道这时对共产党就不害怕了吗？第二点，他到台湾以后马上就找到了职业！这也不是一般学生所遭遇的情形。第三点，台湾限制青年人出境，手续很麻烦，但他谈到他离开台湾到香港时，很轻松地说：“我买了船票就马马虎虎上了船，也没什么手续。”这是怎么回事？
    但这些问题很少有人怀疑过。大伙都被他平日的“积极”迷惑住了。思想改造运动又这样让他很轻松地混过去了。
    就在平时，张锦棠也不是绝对不露马脚的，问题是周围的人太麻痹了。有一次，张锦棠替全校教员给天津教师学院写一封请求恢复业余学习的信，写成后，有人说他写得太模糊，他无意中露了一句：“这年头，模糊点儿好！”又有一天，天津日报上登着一个劳动模范的像片。他不自觉地说：“你看，这人活像蒋委员长！”旁边一位教员就故意对他说：“是呀！听说在台湾，谁要提一声蒋委员长就得立正！”他说：“是，蒋委员长，立正！”说着便作出立正姿式，但马上就发觉不对头，连忙改嘴说：“什么，蒋介石他妈的一套法西斯玩意儿！”有时他兴奋了，嘴里就哼出这么一首歌：“我们要自由，我们要复仇！”有人听了觉得奇怪，问他唱的是什么。他很慌张，但马上故作镇静说：“这是抗战时在大后方很流行的一首歌。”其实这歌是特务唱的要向人民复仇的歌。有一次学校大扫除，张锦棠负责擦电灯，结果那天晚上电线着火了。如果不是发现得早，险些搞出大乱子。事后检查原因，但一听说是张锦棠擦的电灯，就没有人再怀疑，大家肯定是电灯走火。
    我们的人这样麻痹大意，但特务分子却完全不是这样，他的一举一动都是有目的有计划的。请看一看张丹秋被捕后写的供词吧！
    “我是抱着长期潜伏的计划的，想先钻到政府机关内部，站住脚，然后再活动。我打入学校的计划是，第一步巩固潜伏，不乱说乱动，假积极争取领导信任。我使用的手段是靠拢领导，拉拢能力强、比较进步的人，打击能力差和比较落后的人，以抬高自己，施用小惠，使人家对我有好感，麻痹人们对我的注意。例如学校的董兆华是学校的领导，我就紧紧地靠拢他。但我对他也并不是一味卑躬屈膝地奉承，他有缺点我也提出一些批评，这样才像个同志；不过这是有限度的，总的目的还是表示好感。张大文在干校负责政治学习和思想领导。我对他是不即不离，闲话少说。邵铁汉是工会负责人，领导上很信任他，我就常向他请教，拉拢他。孙淑芝在开积极分子会上常反映同事的情况，我觉得她是领导的耳目，就用介绍对象的手段拉拢她，以巩固我的潜伏。
    我对每一个运动都是事先打好主意，争先检讨，什么都说，就是不说是特务。我说我在上海念书时生活腐化，目的是想把我自己打扮成一个紈袴子弟，因为少爷派头的人在学校里大多数是鬼混，不过问政治的。企图以此来冲淡我的政治色彩，以免受人注意。
    在政治学习上，我发言很谨慎也很热烈，能说一套空理论，对思想落后的同事总是极力驳斥，在检讨会上也能撕开面皮，我就耍这一套手段，领导上也就觉得我不错，把我列入积极分子之列。
    在课堂上我也说一套空理论，假装立场稳，观点正确。在学业上也假装认真负责，以此蒙蔽学员，使他们看不出我的特务尾巴。我主动地为学员补了一暑假的课，目的是买学员的好，掩护特务身份。”
    “好女婿”“好丈夫”
    在家里，张锦棠把自己装扮成一个“好女婿”，“好丈夫”，“好姐夫”。他每个月领了工资连包都不打开，原封不动地交给他老丈人。他对他老婆体贴入微，而且还鼓励她争取入党。在他内弟入团的问题上，他起了决定性的作用。当时他岳母不赞成他内弟入团，怕入了团调到别处。张锦棠一面打通他丈母娘的思想，一面给他内弟讲革命大道理。他说：“入团是光荣的，可以更好地为人民服务。”
    但张锦棠有时也是会露出马脚的。有一次他忽然说：“中国局势不能算是定局，一切都取决于第三次世界大战。”在另外一些场合，张锦棠常吹嘘美国这好那好，给家里人灌输崇美思想。
    他的很多活动曾被他老婆和内弟发现过。但他们不愿深追，也不向组织反映，还站在反动立场包庇他。张锦棠刚到天津，就写了封信给台湾要证书，后来证书寄来了，但寄来的是经济系的毕业证书，不是他所说的法律系。他老婆问他：“这是怎么回事？你在台湾究竟有没有念书？”张锦棠回答：“念过。”她也就不再追问了。不久，他又到天津美丽照像馆照了一张学生照片寄给台湾，叫再给他寄一张法律系的证书，他老婆也知道这事，但也没有追问。镇压反革命运动展开以后，有一天早上，他看到一条逮捕特务的消息，忽然说：“国民党正在台湾训练大批的特务到大陆来活动。”他老婆和内弟听了，愣了一下，问：“你在台湾那里受训的？”他马上生气地说：“我那里也没受训，你们不要胡乱放炮！我要是作特务也不到天津来！”他老婆和内弟也就没深追。一九五一年夏天，张锦棠写的一封情报信夹在书里露出来，叫他老婆看见了，问：“这是什么？”他忙说：“是算术草稿。”他老婆也就不吭声了。不久他内弟去清河制呢厂实习，他托他内弟把一封情报信带到北京寄往香港。他对他内弟说：“这封信是叫我香港的朋友借给我几个钱。”又说：“总在天津往香港寄信不大好。带到北京免得叫人注意。”他有工资，生活很富裕，为什么还要向人借钱？这不很值得怀疑吗？但他内弟只问了一句：“干吗要人家给你寄钱？”就把信给带走了。
    他老婆和内弟还发现了他许多可疑的地方，但仍然不时地向他讲一些有关外汇、物价、货币、输出和输入，以及工业厂矿迁移的情况。他老婆还带过文件回家。这些都被他当成情报密告敌人了。张丹秋被捕时，他写情报用的密写本也被搜出来了。
    在我们的国家里确实还有这样的人，他们考虑一切问题都是从感情出发，所以对任何可疑的事都不加以怀疑。可是特务并不是那样有感情，他们同任何人接近都是为了利用这些人。
    让我们看一看张丹秋的供词吧：
    “在台湾受匪特训练时，我就向敌人说过我岳父在天津一个面粉厂当经理。从前作过官，有些社会关系，可以掩护我的活动。又说我岳父有个大儿子是八路军老干部，也可以通过大儿子的关系打入人民的内部。我可以借和我未婚妻结婚的名义潜回天津。
    我一进匪特训练班就给我未婚妻写了封信说，我已转学到台湾大学，半年后就可回到天津。快毕业的时候，又写了封信叫我岳父给我往香港寄四百元港币作路费。这是烟幕弹，我怕人怀疑我那有那么多的钱回国。同时这样做了，我老婆一定会向亲戚朋友说，我回到天津后大家就不会怀疑我了。
    我到天津后，我留意我岳父的家庭和他的社会关系。他们都是一个个的棋子，我要使他们在不知不觉中被利用，事实上我从他们的口中得到了不少的重要情报。
    为了利用他们，我必须取得他们的好感。我的岳父有中国传统的封建思想，他认为家庭中必须长幼有序，子女必须有礼貌，守规矩。所以我领了薪水就不开包交给他，使他觉得我人挺厚道，守规矩。
    我岳父有不少朋友。有一次有一个朋友从兰州来住在我岳父家。我找他谈话，我考虑到将来国际局势紧张时，我可以利用他建立据点。
    我岳父另一个朋友是个资本家，我想将来国际局势紧张时也可用他拉拢工商界人士，组织团体，迎接变化，也想使用他到香港给我跑交通。
    我叫我内弟入团，目的是他入了团对于我们的家庭成分有些好处。将来毕业也可以找到好工作，可以了解很多机密，这对我是有利的。我想利用我内弟在学校里建立组织。我叫我内弟常带一些同学到家里来玩。这样我可偷偷地物色一些人，而且也可以避免外人对我们家的注意。
    我鼓励我老婆‘积极’，以求将来加入共产党，给我作工作。”
    这就是特务的真实面貌和思想。
    逃不出人民群众的眼睛
    天津公安局有一天收到了一封信。信内写道：
    “……我是由天津来哈尔滨的。我现在中国人民银行哈尔滨义州街办事处工作。
    在我们全国大张旗鼓镇压反革命的时候，我们哈市人民银行也开展了学习。我记起了一个人。希望你们精确的调查，详细追询其人的活动，以给人民除奸除害。
    我在天津某天早晨由东楼赴大沽路去平安电影院，看见了一个熟人，当我喊出他的名字时，他仓皇失色的看我。我知道解放前他在上海作过许多坏事……由这些证明他是一个特务。请你们调查镇压。尤其他这次由台湾回来，多半是作特务活动……。”
    公安局按照信里所写的地址找到了张丹秋。经过详细调查，他的确是个特务分子，于是把他逮捕了。
    群众的眼睛是雪亮的，只要群众发动起来，敌人再狡猾也逃不了。
