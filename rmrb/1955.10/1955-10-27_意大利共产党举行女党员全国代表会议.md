Xinhua News Agency, Rome, October 26th. According to TASS, the Second National Conference of Women Party Members of the Italian Communist Party was held in Rome in recent days, attended by 660 delegates. Phoebe, the head of the Women's Committee of the Party Central Committee, made a report on the struggle of Italian women for peace, freedom, and social reform. Many famous Italian women social activists participated in the discussion of the report.

The General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti, delivered a speech at the closing meeting of the conference. He said that when the first National Conference of Women Party Members was held in 1945, the Italian Communist Party had only 80,000 women members. Now, there are 575,000 women members; in addition, 100,000 young women have joined the Italian Communist Youth League. Togliatti pointed out that this is a sign of a major leap forward in Italian social life.

Togliatti continued that the movement to fight for women's liberation is an important component of the entire struggle for the democratic reform of Italian society, which concerns all women who are fighting to satisfy their demands - the right to work and equal pay for equal work with men, the right to education, and the right to hold any position. In order to achieve these goals, there must be a unified mass organization of all Italian women. The Italian Women's Alliance is such an organization.

Togliatti called on Italian women Communist Party members to strengthen and improve the work of striving to establish a broad women's front.

    意大利共产党举行女党员全国代表会议
    新华社二十六日讯　据塔斯社罗马二十五日讯：意大利共产党女党员第二次全国代表会议最近几天在罗马举行，参加会议的有六百六十个代表。党中央委员会妇女委员会的负责人菲比在会上作了关于意大利妇女为争取和平、自由和社会革新而斗争的报告。意大利许多有名的妇女社会活动家都参加了这个报告的讨论。
    意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在代表会议的闭幕会议上发表演说。他说：在一九四五年举行女党员第一次全国代表会议时，意大利共产党只有八万女党员。现在却有女党员五十七万五千；此外，还有十万女青年参加了意大利共产主义青年团。陶里亚蒂指出：这是意大利社会生活的重大跃进的标志。
    陶里亚蒂接着说，争取妇女解放的运动是争取意大利社会的民主革新的整个斗争的一个重要组成部分，这是为争取满足自己的要求——劳动权利和同男子同工同酬的权利，受教育的权利，担任任何职务的权利——而斗争的全体妇女都关心的。为了达到这些目标，必须有一个全意大利妇女的统一的群众性组织。意大利妇女联盟就是这样的一个组织。
    陶里亚蒂号召意大利女共产党员加强和改进争取建立广泛的妇女战线的工作。
