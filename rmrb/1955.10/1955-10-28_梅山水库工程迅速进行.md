    Meishan Reservoir Project Proceeding Rapidly
    The Meishan Reservoir project is proceeding rapidly. Encouraged by the First Five-Year Plan, the people building the reservoir, after completing the No. 3 buttress fifteen days ahead of schedule, completed the No. 2 buttress more than two months ahead of the annual plan. At present, the general elevation of the dam buttresses has reached 123.6 meters, and the elevation of the dam arches has reached 113.6 meters (the total elevation of the dam body is 141 meters). In addition to the arch dam itself, the "water retaining wall" and "spillway" of the hydroelectric power station are also being poured with concrete. The builders of the reservoir are working hard to complete the entire dam body by December this year.
    In the winter of 1954, the builders of the Meishan Reservoir were still working hard to clear the dam foundation. In just eight or nine months, the actual elevation of the dam buttresses has been poured to nearly 70 meters above the ground. (Attached picture)

    梅山水库工程迅速进行
    梅山水库工程正在迅速进行，建筑水库的人们在第一个五年计划的鼓舞下，继提前十五天把三号垛浇筑到顶后，又把二号垛较年度计划提前两个多月浇筑到顶。目前，坝垛的一般高程已达到一二三·六公尺，坝拱的高程已达到一一三·六公尺（坝身的总高程是一四一公尺）。除连拱坝本身工程外，水力发电站的“挡水墙”、“溢洪道”等工程也浇筑混凝土。水库的建筑者正在为争取于今年十二月份将坝身全部浇筑到顶而努力。
    一九五四年冬天，梅山水库建筑者还在这里紧张地清理坝基，仅八、九个月的时间，坝垛的实际高程已浇筑到高出地面将近七十公尺。（附图片）
