    Women's 3,000-meter Cycling Final Breaks National Record
    Zhao Ji
    The women's 3,000-meter cycling final of the First National Workers' Games was held on the afternoon of the 6th, and the athletes who won the top three places in this competition broke the national record.
    A total of twenty-six athletes participated in the competition, divided into nine groups, and the ranking was based on their results. Among them were the excellent female cyclists Li Fengqin, Li Guizhi, and Wu Shuhua, who were already familiar to the audience. Li Fengqin, a "Three Goods" female athlete from the First Machinery Team, and Li Guizhi from the Heavy Industry Team, broke the national records for women's 3,000-meter and 5,000-meter cycling respectively at the Liaoning Provincial Cross-country and Cycling Competition in June of this year. Wu Shuhua from the Light Industry Team broke the national record for women's 1,500-meter cycling at the conference the day before. Yesterday, all three of them competed in the same group.
    At the start of this group's competition, the three of them engaged in intense competition, with three bikes following each other closely, speeding around the track lap after lap. Sometimes Li Guizhi took the lead, then Wu Shuhua was in front, and in the blink of an eye, Li Fengqin overtook again. At times, they were almost shoulder-to-shoulder as they sped past the audience, and only at the turns could one distinguish who was slightly ahead and who was slightly behind. With only two laps to go, Li Fengqin put on a burst of speed and moved to the front. However, the distance between them never exceeded five meters. The three bikes sped away again, linked together. Only the last lap remained—four hundred meters. All three began to sprint. At this point, Li Fengqin surged to the front, followed by Li Guizhi and Wu Shuhua, and they completed the race one after another. Li Fengqin's time was six minutes seventeen seconds four, winning first place. Li Guizhi's time was six minutes seventeen seconds five, winning second place. Wu Shuhua's time was six minutes seventeen seconds seven, winning third place. The results of all three of them broke the national record of six minutes eighteen seconds.
    Their ability to achieve such outstanding results is due to a arduous training process. Li Fengqin is a female sand molder at the Dalian Shipyard. In 1949, because of her good work, the factory awarded her a bicycle, and since then she has often ridden a bicycle. In 1952, she participated in a cycling competition at the company's sports meet. Although she failed, she developed a strong interest in cycling. Every morning, regardless of wind or rain, she would ride her bike to practice. Through diligent study and hard practice, her cycling skills continuously improved. Li Guizhi is an assistant inspector at Anshan Iron and Steel. Before 1952, she could not ride a bicycle. Later, because she often had to go out to understand the situation, and taking the bus was very inconvenient, she began to ride a bicycle. Last year, she won first place in the cycling competition at the Anshan Workers' Games. Afterwards, she joined the Anshan Cycling Training Group, and every morning she would get up at four o'clock and ride her bike to the People's Stadium, which was seven or eight li away from her dormitory, to practice without interruption. Sometimes, after finishing her training, she would ride more than thirty li to build up her strength. Wu Shuhua is a papermaker at the Dadong Paper Mill in Fushun City. She also only learned to ride a bicycle in 1952. In 1953, at the Fushun City Games, she participated in the women's 2,000-meter cycling relay race and won first place. She was selected as a member of the Fushun City Cycling Team and went to the stadium to practice every week. Feeling that her physical strength was insufficient, she practiced long-distance running, which increased her strength and made her cycling speed faster. In 1954, at the joint sports meet held by Anshan, Fushun, and Benxi, she broke the national record for the 1,500-meter cycling with a time of two minutes fifty-nine seconds.

    打破全国纪录的女子三千公尺自行车决赛   
    赵基
    全国第一届工人体育运动大会在六日下午举行了女子三千公尺自行车决赛，获得这项比赛前三名的运动员都打破了全国最高纪录。
    参加比赛的共二十六名运动员，分九个组进行比赛，按成绩排列名次。她们之中有早已为观众所熟悉的优秀自行车女运动员李凤琴、李桂芝、吴淑华。第一机械代表队的“三好”女运动员李凤琴和重工业代表队的李桂芝，在今年六月辽宁省越野、自行车比赛大会上曾分别打破女子三千公尺和五千公尺自行车的全国最高纪录，轻工业代表队的吴淑华就是在前一天的大会上打破了女子一千五百公尺自行车的全国最高纪录。昨天，她们三个人都在一个组里进行比赛。
    这一组的比赛一开始，三个人就展开了紧张的竞赛，三辆车一辆跟着一辆像连在一起似的飞快地跑了一圈又一圈。有时李桂芝领先，一会儿吴淑华又跑在前面，转眼间李凤琴又超过了。有时候几乎是并着肩从观众眼前掠过，只有在拐弯的地方才能分辨出来谁在前一点，谁在后一点。只差两个圈了，李凤琴加了一把劲赶到最前面。但她们之间的距离最远时仍不超过五公尺。三辆车又连在一起飞快地跑开了。只剩最后一圈——四百公尺了。三个人都开始冲刺，这时李凤琴冲到了最前面，其次是李桂芝、吴淑华，就这样一辆车跟着一辆车地跑完全程。李凤琴的成绩是六分十七秒四，获得第一名，李桂芝的成绩是六分十七秒五，得第二名，吴淑华的成绩是六分十七秒七，获得第三名。她们三人的成绩都打破了六分十八秒的全国最高纪录。
    她们能获得这样的优异成绩，都是经过艰苦的锻炼过程。李凤琴是大连造船公司的翻砂女工，一九四九年因为工作好，厂里奖给他一辆自行车，从此她就经常骑自行车。一九五二年公司举行运动大会，她参加自行车比赛，虽然失败了，但对自行车运动有了浓厚的兴趣。每天早晨不管刮风下雨，总是骑着车子去练习，经过勤学苦练，骑车技术不断提高。李桂芝是鞍钢助理监察员，一九五二年以前还不会骑自行车，以后因为经常要到外面了解情况，坐公共汽车很不方便，才开始骑自行车。去年在鞍山职工运动会上她获得了自行车比赛的第一名。以后参加了鞍山市自行车锻炼小组，每天早晨四点钟起床骑着车跑到距宿舍七八里远的人民体育场去练习，从不间断，有时锻炼完了还要骑三十多里路，锻炼体力。吴淑华是抚顺市大东造纸厂造纸工人，也是从一九五二年起才学会骑自行车的。一九五三年抚顺市的运动会上，她参加女子二千公尺自行车接力比赛，得到了第一名，被选为抚顺市自行车代表队队员，每星期都到体育场去练习。她觉得自己体力不够，就练习长跑，增加了体力，骑车速度更快了。一九五四年鞍山、抚顺、本溪三市联合举行的运动会上，她曾以二分五十九秒的成绩打破过一千五百公尺自行车的全国最高纪录。
