The railway department plans to lay 1,424 kilometers of new tracks next year, an increase of more than 17 percent over the estimated completion of new railway track laying this year. On October 21, the Ministry of Railways issued an order instructing the engineering bureaus to make preparations in time to fully complete and overfulfill this task next year.

The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway plans to lay 281 kilometers of tracks next year, extending the tracks to Qiaowan Station, more than 100 kilometers west of Yumen, which is more than 100 kilometers ahead of the progress stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway plans to lay 187.8 kilometers of tracks next year. By the end of next year, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway can be opened to traffic one year ahead of schedule. The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway plans to lay 82 kilometers of tracks from Lanzhou to Baotou next year. The Yingtan-Xiamen Railway plans to lay more than 300 kilometers of tracks next year, striving to reach Yong'an ahead of schedule. On the Beijing-Chengde Railway, the Shangbancheng to Yingshouyingzi section plans to lay 66 kilometers of tracks next year, and these two places can be opened to traffic before the end of the year. In addition, the Neijiang-Yibin Railway also plans to start laying 40 kilometers of tracks next year, opening traffic from Neijiang to Zigong. Industrial and mining branch lines plan to lay 287.2 kilometers of tracks on six lines next year. Forest railways also plan to lay 68 kilometers of tracks on two lines next year.

The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway from Gushuichang in Sichuan Province to Guiyang City in Guizhou Province, and the Jiaozuo-Huangni Railway from the Jiaozuo industrial and mining area in Henan Province to Huangni Town in Luan County, Shanxi Province, will begin construction of roadbeds next year.

Xinhua News Agency: By October 20, more than 870 kilometers had been laid on the ten new railways that have been under construction nationwide this year. The railway department has completed more than 70 percent of its plan for laying tracks on new railways this year.

The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway had already laid tracks to Zhangye by the end of September, completing the original annual track-laying task ahead of schedule. Now, the road construction workers are rushing to build bridges, culverts, and roadbed projects on the lake beaches and Gobi Desert west of Zhangye, and have already laid more than four kilometers of tracks west of Zhangye. The Lanzhou to Wuwei section is preparing for its official opening at the beginning of next year. On the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, tracks had been laid close to Gaotanzi Station on October 27, reaching a place 33 kilometers away from Lueyang. The Mianyang to Shangxiba section officially opened passenger and freight transport on October 1. After laying tracks ahead of schedule to Yangjiawan, the original annual track-laying destination on the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, efforts are being concentrated on rushing to build tunnels. The pilot tunnel of the Qinling Tunnel, a key project of the entire Baoji-Chengdu Railway, was connected two months ahead of schedule on September 26, and the monthly progress of the entire tunnel project has increased from 800 meters in June to 2,032 meters in September. The middle section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is rushing to build tunnels and bridges, and ten of the eleven long tunnels over 500 meters have been under construction. Currently, the employees of the entire Baoji-Chengdu Railway are actively rushing to complete various projects for the full line to open to traffic next year. The gauge widening project of the Jining-Erenhot Railway was completed on October 12, and wide-gauge trains have been officially running on the entire line. Now, all employees are rushing to complete unfinished projects and carry out mechanical installation work, and it can be officially operated domestically on December 1. On the 82-kilometer construction site of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway from Lanzhou to Baotou, construction has been fully underway, building roadbeds, bridges, and culverts. Eleven of the twelve tunnels stipulated to start construction here this year have been entered, and five pilot tunnels have been opened. The earth and stone excavation project has already started on the northern section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway. The (Shangbancheng) Ying (Yingshouyingzi) section of the Beijing-Chengde Railway has also started construction of roadbeds and tunnels. In terms of forest railways, the Yalin Line and the Tanglin Line can complete this year's track-laying and other tasks ahead of schedule in November.
