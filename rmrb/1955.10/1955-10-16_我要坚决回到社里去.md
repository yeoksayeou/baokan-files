To the Editor:

My name is Zhu Yutu, and I am a single young farmer with 2.08 mu of good land. When our mutual aid team transformed into a democratic agricultural production cooperative last October, I also joined the cooperative. At that time, I didn't understand that mutual aid and cooperation were the path to common prosperity, nor could I see the great future of socialist construction; I just thought that after joining the cooperative, the cooperative would manage production, and life would immediately get better. However, after joining, because I didn't see immediate cash income, I thought joining the cooperative was not as good as working independently; production was free, and I didn't have to go to meetings. Especially this June, when I saw some farmers selling bamboo shoots as peddlers, earning a yuan or so per trip, I became envious. I thought my two plots of land were in a good location, not easily affected by drought or flood, and even if I farmed them myself, the yield wouldn't be lower than the cooperative's; moreover, the seedlings were already transplanted, and there was less farm work, so how great it would be to make a few small business trips in my spare time! At that time, comrades from the county and township came to the cooperative to implement the policy of voluntary and mutually beneficial cooperation and to rectify the agricultural production cooperative, so I withdrew from the cooperative to sell bamboo shoots for cash.

After withdrawing, I only carried bamboo shoots four or five times, and the money I earned was just enough to eat. Soon, the bamboo shoots became old, and the field work became busy, so I stopped selling them. When doing field work, although I exchanged labor with other families, I was always much later than the cooperative. When the cooperative started weeding for the second time, I was still slowly harrowing the first time; sometimes the field was too dry after weeding, and I couldn't irrigate it; sometimes no one would exchange labor with me, and I couldn't manage alone, so I could only do as much as I could. At this point, I had already begun to feel that my withdrawal from the cooperative was wrong.

By harvest time, I had clearly seen the superiority of the cooperative. Because the cooperative arranged production in a timely manner according to the season, and male and female members had a reasonable division of labor, the work was done quickly and well, and the average yield of early rice was 477 jin per mu. And what about me? I couldn't focus on both production and fertilizer accumulation, and neglecting fertilizer accumulation delayed production. Although the continuous cropping rice grew fairly well, I only harvested 400 jin per mu. When it came to income, I regretted it when I compared myself to Ge Yuecheng, a single member of the cooperative. In terms of land, I had 0.053 mu more than Ge Yuecheng; in terms of labor, I was about the same as him; but my annual income was 40% less than his. Just taking the early rice income as an example, he had already advanced 1070 jin of rice (which is only 40% of his total annual income); while I only had 780 jin. Comparing the late rice, the cooperative's continuous cropping and double-cropping late rice had long and large ears, while I would be lucky if I could reach the yield of early rice.

After tasting the salty and bland flavors of independent farming during this period, I have sobered up. Although I have reduced my income this year, it is not too late to return to the cooperative quickly. I am determined to return to the cooperative! The members are also welcoming me back!

### 我要坚决回到社里去

    我要坚决回到社里去编辑同志：
    我叫朱煜土，是一个单身的青年农民，种二亩零八厘好田。去年十月份我们的联组转成民主农业生产合作社的时候，我也参加了社。当时我还不懂得互助合作是走大家富裕的道路，更看不到社会主义建设的远大前途；只是认为入社后生产社里会管，日子也马上会好过起来。但是，入社以后，由于做了生活看不到现钱，我就认为入社还不如单干好；生产自由，开会也不用去。特别是今年六月间，我看到有些农民做小贩，挑一趟毛竹筍卖，可以赚到块把现钱，就眼红了。我想自己两块田的地位好，晒不死，淹不着，就是自己种，产量也不会比社里低；而且秧已经插下，生活也少了，抽空做几趟小生意多好呀！正在这个时候，县里和乡里的同志来社里贯彻自愿互利政策，整顿农业生产合作社，我就退了社贩毛竹筍赚现钱去了。
    退社以后，我只挑了四、五趟毛竹筍，赚来的一些钱刚好够吃用。不久，筍老了，田里生活也忙了，我就不再去挑了。在做田里的生活的时候，我虽然和别人家换工，可是总要比社里拖迟不少。社里开始耘耥二遍了，我还在田里慢慢耙头遍；有时田耘耥过干掉了，水也车不上；有时无人换工，一个人忙不过来，就只好能做多少就做多少了。这时，我已经开始感到自己退社的不对了。
    到收割的时候，我已经清楚地看到了合作社的优越性。由于社里根据季节及时安排生产，男女社员合理分工，做起活来又快又好，连作早稻平均每亩收割四百七十七斤。而我呢？顾了生产积不到肥，顾到积肥耽误了生产，连作稻虽然长得还算好，每亩也只割得四百斤。讲起收入，我同一个单身汉的社员葛月成一比，就懊悔也来不及了。论田，我比葛月成要多五分三厘；论劳力，我和他差不多；但是全年的收入，我却要比他少百分之四十。光拿早稻收入来讲，他已经预支进稻谷一千零七十斤（这还只是全年总收入的百分之四十呢）；而我呢，只有七百八十斤。拿晚稻来比，社里的连作、双季晚稻生得穗子又长又大，而我顶多能达到早稻的产量就不错了。
    尝过了这一段时期单干的咸和淡，我清醒过来了。我今年虽然减少了收入，但是赶快回社还不算迟。我要坚决回到社里去！社员们也都欢迎着我回去呢！
