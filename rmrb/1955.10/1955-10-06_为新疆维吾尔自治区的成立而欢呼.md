To the Editor:

    Recently, the news of the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which is exciting, was published in the newspaper. The establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is a great joyous event for the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and a great victory for the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policy. This will enable the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, who have already gained equal rights politically, to develop their economic and cultural undertakings more rapidly under the leadership of the Party and gradually improve to the level of advanced ethnic groups. As a Uyghur youth, how can I not be excited and happy about this?

    In this mood, I cannot help but recall my own background once again. In the era of reactionary rule, I was a poor child working as a farmhand for landlords. In 1946, I joined the revolution—the Ili Revolution—and embarked on the path of fighting for the liberation of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. After the liberation of Xinjiang in 1949, I was transferred from Ili to work in Urumqi by the organization and became the manager of the People's Trading Company. Under the education of the Party, I joined the Communist Party of China on July 1, 1950. This is a day worth remembering forever. From that day on, I began to become a proletarian fighter who would fight to the end for the cause of the liberation of all mankind.

    In 1953, in order to further train me, the Party transferred me to Beijing to study. At the beginning, I studied Chinese and some preparatory courses at the preparatory course of the Renmin University of China. Thanks to the teachers' patient education and the brotherly help of Han students, my Chinese was learned enough to go to university in just seven months. In twelve Chinese tests and two exams, all were "Excellent" except for one test which was "Good". In September 1954, I entered the Beijing Foreign Trade Institute. There were many difficulties in learning: I couldn't take complete notes, I couldn't make good outlines for speeches, it was inconvenient to learn Russian through Chinese... However, thanks to the care of the leadership and the help of Han students, I successfully completed the first-year course with all "Excellent" grades.

    In order to thank the Party and Chairman Mao—the mother and leader of all ethnic groups in the country, to thank the People's Liberation Army—the liberators, happy pioneers, and defenders of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and to celebrate the birth of the "Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region", I guarantee to study Marxism-Leninism and all courses even better, improve my political consciousness and political vigilance, strengthen my revolutionary will, and make myself an excellent staff member, and work together with the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the people of the whole country to build a socialist motherland.

    为新疆维吾尔自治区的成立而欢呼编辑同志：
    最近报纸上发表了成立新疆维吾尔自治区这个令人兴奋的消息。新疆维吾尔自治区的成立，是新疆各族人民的大喜事，是中国共产党的民族政策的伟大胜利。这将使政治上已经获得平等权利的新疆各族人民，在党的领导下更快地发展自己的经济、文化事业，逐渐提高到先进民族的水平。我是一个维族青年，怎能不因此而激动和高兴呢？
    在这样的心情下，我不由得再一次回忆起自己的身世。在反动统治时代，我是一个给地主做长工的穷孩子，一九四六年我参加了革命——伊犁革命，从此走上了为新疆各族人民争取解放而斗争的道路。一九四九年新疆解放后，我被组织上从伊犁调到乌鲁木齐工作，当了人民贸易公司的经理。在党的教育下，一九五○年七月一日我加入了中国共产党，这是一个值得永久记忆的日子，从那一天起，我就开始成为一个为全人类解放事业奋斗到底的无产阶级战士了。
    一九五三年，党为了进一步培养我，把我调到北京来学习。开始时，我在中国人民大学预科学习汉文和一些预备课程。由于教师的耐心教育和汉族男女同学们兄弟般的帮助，仅仅七个月，我的汉文就学得能够上大学了。十二次汉文测验、两次考试，除一次测验为良好外，其余都是“优等”。一九五四年九月，我进了北京对外贸易学院。学习中困难是不少的：笔记记不全，发言提纲作不好，通过汉文学俄文不方便……。但是，由于领导方面对我的关心和汉族同学的帮助，我以全部“优良”的成绩胜利地结束了一年级的课程。
    为了感谢党和毛主席——全国各族人民的母亲和领导者，感谢人民解放军——新疆各族人民的解放者，幸福的开拓者和保卫者，为了庆祝“新疆维吾尔自治区”的诞生，我保证要更好地学习马克思列宁主义和各门功课，提高政治觉悟和政治警惕性，加强自己的革命意志，使自己成为一个优秀的工作人员，同新疆各族人民和全国人民一道，为建设社会主义的祖国而奋斗。
