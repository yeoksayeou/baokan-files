To the Editor:

    Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's instructions on the issue of agricultural cooperation have awakened us like a warning bell, correcting our right-leaning thoughts.

    In the past, we always thought that the conditions in mountainous areas were poor and could not be compared with the plains. We used the excuse of having too few cadres and insufficient experience, etc., to avoid actively developing agricultural production cooperatives. As a result, many mutual aid teams with good conditions could not be transformed into cooperatives in a timely manner. For example, the four mutual aid teams of Nian Zhonglian and others in Xintian Village, Malian Township, Chengguan District, totaling twenty-two households, had backbone members and a three-year foundation of mutual aid. Last year, they formally applied to convert to a cooperative three times, and informally requested conversion more than ten times, but the reply was always "the conditions are not yet sufficient." In particular, the blind contraction this spring caused undue setbacks to the mutual aid and cooperation movement. We originally planned to build thirty-nine cooperatives before the summer harvest and another fifty-three before the autumn harvest; soon, at a three-level cadre meeting, this was reduced to only thirty-nine cooperatives; later, a special district committee secretary meeting was held to criticize the "rash advance" mentality in the work, reducing the thirty-nine to thirty-six; and during the process of building the cooperatives, five were stopped. This approach aroused dissatisfaction among the masses and cooperative cadres, who felt that cold water was being poured on them. The construction of cooperatives in Shuangchi Township, Wangba District, was stopped when the third stage was about to end. Farmer Wang Peiying was very dissatisfied and said, "In the past, we were told to create conditions for building cooperatives every day. Now that the cooperatives are about to be built, we are told to stop. We really don't understand, what conditions are needed?" When the agricultural cooperative in Pengjia Township, Ciba District, was about to be completed, we also wanted to stop it, but the members carried it out in the form of "covert cooperatives."

    After the correct instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee were conveyed by higher authorities, we criticized the right-leaning thoughts in the past leadership and analyzed the favorable conditions in our county for building more and better agricultural production cooperatives.

    The enthusiasm of the peasant masses for taking the socialist road is very high. Because the existing agricultural production cooperatives in the county have shown superiority in production, the surrounding peasants are eager to join the cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of August, 615 mutual aid teams, totaling 4,345 households, had formally registered to apply for conversion to cooperatives, most of whom were poor peasants and not-so-well-off peasants. Two hundred and nine mutual aid teams (totaling more than 1,490 households) in six districts, including Wangba, have automatically merged into ninety-three joint teams to create conditions for building cooperatives. Many joint teams are already studying the articles of association of agricultural production cooperatives and related materials on building cooperatives. After the merger of Zhang Youcai's mutual aid team and Wang Yaoxian's mutual aid team in Chujia Township, Chengguan District, they also learned the management methods of the Yanhechuan Agricultural Cooperative, implemented the small contract system in the team, and actively built terraced fields and river embankments to strive for conversion to a cooperative after the autumn harvest. These facts show that we have a foundation for developing agricultural production cooperatives on a large scale.

    From the perspective of the law of movement development, it is possible to develop agricultural production cooperatives on a large scale. In 1953, there was only one cooperative in the county, with 14 peasant households joining; in the spring of 1954, it developed into six cooperatives, with 102 peasant households joining; and this spring, it developed to 113 cooperatives, with 3,958 peasant households joining. After the summer harvest and pre-distribution, the existing cooperatives have been further consolidated. Only twenty-eight cooperatives have fifty-nine members who want to withdraw, of which forty-nine are relatively wealthy new and old middle peasants.

    From the perspective of the Party's leadership, the existing agricultural cooperatives and the mutual aid teams that have applied to build cooperatives have a certain number of Party members, League members, and activists, and there are leading backbones in the cooperatives; and through the test of the movement, a group of Communist Party members will also be developed. At present, many township Party branches have explored some methods and experiences in leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The cadres stationed in the existing cooperatives have basically learned how to run cooperatives, and many cadres at the county, district, and township levels also have basic knowledge of building and running cooperatives. This is a strong guarantee that we will be able to build and run cooperatives well in the future.

    After the above analysis, our confidence in leading the peasants to take the road of collectivization has been greatly strengthened. We guarantee that in 1956, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the county will be developed to 305, and the quality will be guaranteed.

### 我们有条件把农业生产合作社办好

    我们有条件把农业生产合作社办好编辑同志：
    毛主席和党中央关于农业合作化问题的指示，像警钟一样地唤醒了我们，纠正了我们的右倾思想。
    过去，我们总认为山区条件差，不能和平原地区比较，借口干部少、经验不足等等，不去积极发展农业生产合作社。因此，不少条件很好的互助组也不能及时转社。如城关区马连乡新田村年忠廉等四个互助组，共二十二户，有骨干，有三年互助的基础，去年正式提出申请转社三次，非正式提出转社要求十几次，但是得到的答复总是“条件还不够”。特别是今春的盲目收缩，更使互助合作运动受到了不应有的挫折。我们原计划在夏收前要建三十九个社，秋收前再建五十三个社；不久在三级干部会上压缩成只建三十九个社；后来又专门召开了一次区委书记会议来批判工作中的“冒进”情绪，将三十九个压缩为三十六个；而在建社过程中又停建了五个。这种做法引起了群众和办社干部的不满，认为是在他们头上泼冷水。王坝区双池乡的建社工作是在第三阶段就要结束的时候停止的，农民王培应就很不满意地说：“过去天天叫创造建社条件，现在社快要建成了又叫停办，我们真不明白，究竟是要什么条件？”茨坝区彭家乡的农业社快建成的时候，我们也要停办，但是社员们却以“明组暗社”的形式搞下来了。
    上级传达了毛主席和党中央的正确指示以后，我们批判了过去领导方面的右倾思想，分析了我县能够把农业生产合作社办得又多又好的有利条件。
    农民群众走社会主义道路的积极性是很高的。由于全县原有的农业生产合作社在生产中显示了优越性，周围农民都迫切要求入社，据不完全的统计，到八月底为止已经正式报名挂号申请转社的有六百十五个互助组，共四千三百四十五户，其中大部分是贫农和还不很富裕的农民。王坝等六个区有二百零九个互助组（共一千四百九十多户）为了给建社创造条件，已经自动并成九十三个联组。不少联组已经在学习农业生产合作社社章和有关建社材料；城关区楚家乡张有才互助组和王耀贤互助组合并后还向雁河川农业社学习了经营管理的领导方法，在组内推行了小包工制，并积极修梯田、筑河堤，争取在秋后转社。这些事实说明我们大量发展农业生产合作社是有基础的。
    从运动发展规律上来看，大量发展农业生产合作社是可能的。一九五三年全县只有一个社，入社农民十四户；一九五四年春发展成六个社，入社农民一百零二户；今年春季就发展到一百一十三个社，入社农民三千九百五十八户。经过夏收和预分以后，现有社已得到了进一步的巩固，只有二十八个社有五十九户社员要求退社，其中有四十九户是比较富裕的新、老中农。
    再从党的领导力量方面来看，全县现有的农业社和已经申请建社的互助组中，有着一定数量的党员、团员和积极分子，社的领导骨干是有的；而且经过运动的考验，还将发展一批共产党员。目前有很多乡的党支部已经摸索出一些领导互助合作运动的方法和经验，现有社的驻社干部基本上学会了办社，县、区、乡的不少干部也有了建社办社的基本知识，这就是我们今后把社建起来也能够办好的有力保证。
    经过了以上的分析，我们领导农民走合作化道路的信心大大加强了，保证在一九五六年要使全县的农业生产合作社发展到三百零五个，并且要保证质量。
