    A large-scale basic chemical plant – the Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant – is under construction on the bank of the beautiful Songhua River in Jilin City. The plant buildings for the calcium carbide, calcium cyanamide and other workshops of this factory are under intensive construction.
    After completion, this calcium carbide plant will produce large quantities of calcium carbide, which will then be used to directly produce products such as calcium cyanamide and acetic acid. These are important raw materials for the organic synthesis chemical industry. After further synthesis, these raw materials can be used to obtain many chemical industrial products such as dyes, medicines, plastics, alcohol, paints, solvents, glass, oilcloth, artificial leather, rayon, and safety film. Therefore, calcium carbide is sometimes called the "mother of the organic synthesis chemical industry." Calcium carbide is also a product urgently needed for industrial basic construction and production in our country. It can generate flames with a high heat of 3,000 degrees and can be used to cut and weld metals. The construction of metal structure factory buildings, bridges, ships, and trains all require it. Calcium cyanamide can also be used as a good chemical fertilizer.
    The future production process of this basic chemical plant will be highly mechanized. Limestone, one of the main raw materials of calcium carbide, will begin its journey on transportation machinery after being loaded onto trains from nearby mines. Belt conveyors, bucket chain conveyors, and other types of transportation machinery will be connected along the production process to form a transportation line that can change direction, rise, and fall, undertaking all the transportation work of limestone and other solid raw materials. The operation of many machines in the production process is uniformly controlled by workers sitting in the control room based on various instruments and meters. The dust, high heat, and unpleasant odors common in old chemical plants will be replaced here by fresh, cool, and moist air. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 松花江畔正在兴建一座规模宏大的电石厂

    松花江畔正在兴建一座规模宏大的电石厂
    在吉林市秀丽的松花江畔，正在兴建一座规模宏大的基本化学工厂——吉林电石厂。这座工厂的电石、碳氮化钙等车间的厂房建筑工程都正在紧张施工。
    这座电石厂建成以后将大量生产电石，从电石又直接生产碳氮化钙和醋酸等产品。这些都是有机合成化学工业的重要原料，这些原料经过进一步合成，可以得到染料、药品、塑料、酒精、油漆、溶剂、玻璃、漆布、人造皮革、人造丝、安全电影片等很多化学工业产品。所以人们有时把电石称为
  “有机合成化学工业之母”。电石又是目前我国工业基本建设和生产迫切需要的产品，它能发三千度高热的火焰，能用来切割和熔接金属，建设金属结构厂房、修建桥梁、制造轮船和火车等都需要它。碳氮化钙还可以作为一种很好的化学肥料。
    这座基本化学工厂未来的生产过程将是高度机械化的。电石的主要原料之一——石灰石从附近的矿山装上火车后，便开始在运输机械上旅行。皮带运输机、链斗运输机等多种运输机械，将沿着生产过程连结起来，组成一条能够转换方向、上升、下降的运输线，担负石灰石和其他固体原料的全部运输工作。生产中许多机械的运转，都是由坐在控制室里的工人根据各种计器、仪表统一指挥的。旧有化学工厂常见的粉尘、高热和难闻气味，在这里将被新鲜、凉爽和湿润的空气代替。（新华社）
