Xinhua News Agency, October 13th, TASS dispatch from Paris: The French National Assembly began debating the Faure government's policy on the Algerian question on the 11th.

As everyone knows, the situation in Algeria has long been a source of unease for French government officials. The problem lies in the fact that Algeria is legally an integral part of French territory, but the residents of Algeria do not have basic political rights. The situation in Algeria demonstrates the Algerian people's dissatisfaction with their current status. Due to the very tense political and military situation in Algeria, the French government authorized the Governor-General of Algeria, Soustelle, to formulate a socio-economic "reform" plan to "calm down" Algeria. Soustelle's plan also stipulated that Algeria should eventually be administratively merged with France. This plan was opposed by the majority of members of the Second Committee (composed of Muslims) of the Algerian Assembly (the Governor-General's advisory body).

Duclos, Chairman of the Communist Party parliamentary group, spoke in the debate. He said that in Algeria, one sees the repetition of the mistakes and crimes that once dragged France into the protracted and costly Indochina War. He condemned the repressive policies of the French Governor-General of Algeria, Soustelle, protested against the banning and dissolution of the Algerian Communist Party, and vehemently attacked the so-called policy of "merging" Algeria (i.e., completely merging it with France) as "a blatant conspiracy aimed at deceiving the Algerian people." Duclos emphasized that it is wrong to refuse to satisfy the national aspirations of the Algerian people.

Duclos pointed out that the policy of force being implemented in Algeria is being enforced by a small group of colonialists, and emphasized that French youth are unwilling to fight for the interests of the colonial bourgeoisie.

Duclos, on behalf of the French Communist Party parliamentary group, demanded that the government abandon the so-called "merger policy" and begin negotiations with qualified representatives of the Algerian people. He demanded that military actions be stopped first, the state of emergency be lifted, political prisoners be released, and all measures hindering the activities of Algerian political parties be abolished.

Following him, General Aumeran, a representative of the French colonialist group, spoke. He demanded that the government carry out the death sentences already imposed on some Algerian national liberation movement members. Another right-wing member of parliament, Val (Peasant Party), also made the same request.

People's Republican Party member Fonlupt-Esperaber also demanded that the government abandon its policy of repression. He emphasized that it is impossible to solve the Algerian problem by force.

The debate is continuing.

Xinhua News Agency, October 13th, TASS dispatch from Paris, October 11th: According to newspaper reports, French authorities in Algeria have arrested a large number of people participating in the national liberation movement. A large number of those arrested have been sentenced to death by special military tribunals. According to Mr. Hulot, Minister for Moroccan and Tunisian Affairs, some of these sentences have already been carried out. In addition, there are still many Algerians sentenced to death in prisons.

The French General Confederation of Labor has issued an appeal to the French working people, calling on them to strive to stop the execution of Algerians sentenced by military tribunals. The French General Confederation of Labor said that all working people should strive to stop this bloodshed, which will only complicate the tense situation in Algeria.

    法国国民议会就法政府对阿尔及利亚问题的政策进行辩论
    杜克洛主张首先停止军事行动并进行谈判
    法国殖民当局在阿尔及利亚大批逮捕和枪杀爱国者
    新华社十三日讯　塔斯社巴黎讯：法国国民议会十一日开始就富尔政府对阿尔及利亚问题的政策进行辩论。
    大家知道，阿尔及利亚的情况长期以来就使得法国政府人士感到不安。问题在于：阿尔及利亚在法律上是法国领土的一个组成部分，而阿尔及利亚的居民却没有基本的政治权利。阿尔及利亚的情况表明阿尔及利亚人民对自己现在的地位的不满。由于阿尔及利亚政治和军事情况非常紧张，法国政府授权阿尔及利亚总督苏斯戴尔制定了一个社会经济“改革”计划，以便使阿尔及利亚“平静下来”。苏斯戴尔的计划还规定阿尔及利亚最后要在行政上同法国合并。这个计划遭到阿尔及利亚议会（总督的咨询机构）第二委员会（由回教徒组成）的大多数委员的反对。
    共产党议会党团主席杜克洛在辩论中发言。他说：在阿尔及利亚，看到了曾经把法国拖入旷日持久、劳民伤财的印度支那战争中去的那种错误和罪行的重演。他谴责法国驻阿尔及利亚总督苏斯戴尔的镇压政策，抗议取缔和解散阿尔及利亚共产党的行为，并且猛烈抨击所谓“合并”阿尔及利亚（即把它同法国完全合并）的政策是“目的在于欺骗阿尔及利亚人民的露骨的阴谋”。杜克洛强调指出：拒绝满足阿尔及利亚人民的民族愿望是错误的。
    杜克洛指出在阿尔及利亚执行的武力政策是一小撮殖民主义者强制执行的，并且强调法国青年不愿意为殖民资产阶级的利益打仗。
    杜克洛代表法国共产党议会党团，要求政府放弃所谓“合并政策”，并且开始同阿尔及利亚人民的有资格的代表谈判。他要求首先停止军事行动，撤销紧急状态，释放政治犯和废除妨碍阿尔及利亚的政党进行活动的一切措施。
    接着发言的是法国殖民主义者集团的一个代表奥麦朗将军。他要求政府执行已经对一些阿尔及利亚民族解放运动者判处的死刑。另一个右翼议员瓦尔（农民党）也提出同样的要求。
    人民共和党议员冯吕勃—艾斯贝拉伯也要求政府放弃镇压政策。他着重指出，用武力来解决阿尔及利亚问题是不可能的。
    辩论继续进行中。
    新华社十三日讯　据塔斯社巴黎十一日讯：据报纸报道，法国当局在阿尔及利亚大批逮捕参加民族解放运动的人。一大批被捕者已经被特别军事法庭判处死刑。据摩洛哥与突尼斯事务部长许里最近说，其中一部分判决已经执行。此外，在监狱中现在还有许多被判处死刑的阿尔及利亚人。
    法国总工会为此发表了告法国劳动人民书，号召他们争取停止处死被军事法庭判决的阿尔及利亚人。法国总工会说，全体劳动人民应该努力来制止这种只会使阿尔及利亚的紧张局势复杂化的流血事件。
