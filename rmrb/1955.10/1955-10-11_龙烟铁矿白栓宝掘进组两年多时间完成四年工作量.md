    The Bai Shuanbao excavation team of Longyan Iron Mine completed four years' worth of work from the beginning of 1953 to September 25th of this year.
    In order to expedite the completion of the country's first Five-Year Plan, the Bai Shuanbao excavation team never wasted a single second. They consistently adhered to two cycles of operation within eight hours, increasing the footage per shift by onefold compared to other teams. They constantly studied and improved their techniques. For example, in the inclined shaft, they added temporary tracks of varying lengths from two to four meters away from the working face, changing the inconvenience of transportation in the inclined shaft, which doubled the loading efficiency; based on learning the experience of the Ma Wanshui excavation team, they further created the "double wedge-shaped cross-cut method," which increased excavation efficiency by more than 30 percent. In recent years, they have successively promoted advanced tools such as water-powered drills, air legs, and alloy drill bits, which greatly reduced physical labor, improved the working environment, and increased attendance rates.
    Starting from the first year of the first Five-Year Plan, the Bai Shuanbao excavation team has overfulfilled the state plan every year. In 1953, they completed the equivalent of sixteen and a half months of work, in 1954 they completed nineteen and a half months of the plan, and this year, by September 25th, they had completed the annual plan three months and five days ahead of schedule. They are now working on the 1957 plan and will strive to overfulfill all the tasks of the first Five-Year Plan by July 1st next year. (Feng Feng)

    龙烟铁矿白栓宝掘进组两年多时间完成四年工作量
    龙烟铁矿白栓宝掘进组，从一九五三年初到今年九月二十五日，即完成了四年的工作量。
    白栓宝掘进组为了使国家第一个五年计划提前完成，从不浪费一分一秒钟的时间。他们始终坚持八小时内的两次循环作业，使每一班进尺比其他组提高一倍。他们经常研究技术，改进技术。如他们在斜井添设了离掌子面二公尺到四公尺不等长度的临时轨道，改变了斜井运输不便的情况，使装车效率提高一倍；在学习马万水掘进组经验的基础上，他们进一步创造了“双楔形交叉掏槽法”，使掘进效率提高百分之三十以上。几年来，他们先后推广了水式风钻、风腿子、合金钻头等先进工具，大大减轻了体力劳动，改善了作业环境，提高了出勤率。
    白栓宝掘进组从第一个五年计划的第一年度开始，年年都超额完成国家计划。一九五三年完成了相当十六个半月的工作量，一九五四年完成了十九个半月的计划，今年到九月二十五日又提前三个月零五天完成了全年计划。他们现在已在做一九五七年度的工作，并要争取在明年七月一日超额完成第
    一个五年计划的全部任务。　（峰峰）
