    Response to Criticism from This Newspaper
    The Ministry of Railways of the People's Republic of China wrote to say that the criticism of the Ministry of Railways in the People's Daily editorial "Seriously Check the Work of Resettling Demobilized Construction Servicemen," published on August 17, was correct. Because we did not take timely and concrete measures regarding the State Council's resolution on the resettlement of demobilized construction servicemen, we lacked education and inspection of subordinate levels. In order to properly resettle demobilized construction servicemen, we plan to adopt a unified distribution method within the railway system, receiving 5,000 people this year and planning to receive 35,000 people next year. Regarding the 5,000 demobilized construction servicemen allocated this year, we have jointly issued instructions with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, ordering the civil affairs departments of various provinces and municipalities, as well as the railway bureaus and engineering bureaus, to handle the handover work. In addition, the Political Department of the Ministry of Railways has specifically issued political work instructions to railway units regarding the reception of demobilized construction servicemen.

    对本报批评的反应
    中华人民共和国铁道部来信说，八月十七日人民日报发表的“认真检查安置复员建设军人的工作”社论中对铁道部的批评是正确的。由于我们对国务院关于安置复员建设军人工作的决议没有及时采取具体措施，以致对下缺乏教育和检查。为妥善地安置复员建设军人，我们准备在铁路系统采取归口统一分配的办法，今年接收五千人，明年计划接收三万五千人。对今年分配的五千名复员建设军人，我们已同内务部共同下达了指示，令各省、市民政部门及各铁路局、工程局办理交接工作。另由铁道部政治部专门对铁路各单位发了关于接收复员建设军人的政治工作指示。
