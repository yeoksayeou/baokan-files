Kabuki – A Traditional Japanese National Drama

Nakamura Kan'emon

I. Japanese Kabuki

Kabuki originated from Japanese folk traditions, initially as a folk art primarily based on singing and dancing.

After its emergence in 1603, Kabuki was warmly welcomed by the people. Although it was suppressed by the Tokugawa feudal government, it continued to develop according to the wishes of the people, and by the Genroku era, around 1688, it had evolved into a complete theatrical form. The Genroku era was a period when Japan's emerging merchant class was gradually growing. During this period, excellent writers, artists, and scholars emerged from the people, leaving behind many outstanding works. This era is known as "Genroku Culture" or "Citizen Culture" and is one of the most glorious periods in Japanese national cultural history. Kabuki from this period is also referred to as "Genroku Kabuki." Thanks to the plays of the outstanding realist writer Chikamatsu Monzaemon, often called the "Shakespeare of Japan," which were filled with a spirit of humanism, dramas reflecting the social life of the time began to appear on the Japanese stage. Simultaneously, renowned actors like Sakata Tōjūrō, who pioneered realist acting, emerged. It can be said that Kabuki laid its foundation during this era.

However, since the mid-Genroku era, the Tokugawa feudal government adopted a policy of national isolation, prohibiting foreign trade, intensifying pressure on the merchant class, and blocking their avenues for economic development. The merchant class gradually began to compromise with the feudal government. After the Meiji Restoration, a thorough democratic revolution was not carried out; instead, a process of modernization and capitalization began while compromising with the feudal system, quickly entering the stage of imperialism.

Kabuki was also influenced by this, carrying the contradictions of feudalism and populism intertwined. Nurtured and cherished by the people, it took root in their lives and has persisted to this day, spanning approximately three hundred years. Even now, Kabuki remains the theatrical genre with the largest audience in Japan. The main reasons why it continues to receive popular support are as follows:

First, Kabuki has preserved aspects of populism despite feudal oppression. Starting with Chikamatsu Monzaemon in the Genroku era, excellent "puppet jōruri" playwrights such as Takeda Izumo, Namiki Sōsuke, Chikamatsu Hanji, and Chikamatsu Yanagi, as well as artists and Kabuki artists such as Namiki Gohei, Umeda Harisuke, Kawatake Mokuami, and Okamoto Kido, in their series of works, truthfully depicted the people's suffering under the constraints of the feudal system or conveyed a spirit of resistance against it. From their works, we can see the seeds of humanism, which upheld humanity, and realism, which strived to depict reality.

Second, there is the beautiful national artistic form of Kabuki created by the people. Japanese Kabuki absorbed various theatrical expression techniques such as music, dance, dialogue, symbolism, and realism, integrating and developing into a perfect stage art in just a few hundred years, and growing up under conditions of national isolation. From this perspective, we can see how abundant the creativity of the people is. This beautiful stage art, cultivated by the people's rich creativity, and their love for it and its attraction to the people, is another major reason why Kabuki could not be eliminated.

After watching Chinese dramas, I feel that they have a long history. Due to the rich creativity of the people, they have developed into a beautiful and complete art. However, they also contain elements of feudalism and populism. Therefore, instead of accepting it uncritically, we should discard its feudal dross and promote the essence of its populism. Although the national conditions are different, I believe these experiences are important lessons for Japanese Kabuki to learn from as it advances in the future. At the same time, the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" can serve as a guideline for the entire Japanese drama movement in the future and is worth studying seriously.

Currently, Japanese culture is in danger of being submerged by decadent American culture, and Japan's traditional national culture is being belittled and destroyed. However, the growing strength of the Japanese people, centered on the working class, in their struggle for peace, independence, and democracy, has not ignored this situation. The Japanese people are increasingly concerned with defending their national culture. We firmly believe that, both today and tomorrow, the Japanese people have the power to defend their national culture and develop it in the right direction.

In this situation, the visit of Japanese Kabuki to China is of profound significance. We must thank our Chinese friends because Chinese national drama is imbued with the spirit of serving the people, its populism has been developed, and it is constantly advancing along the path of socialist realism, providing us with a model to learn from.

In summary, Japanese Kabuki is a stage art that combines various folk arts of Japan and absorbed folk arts transmitted from China. It is deeply rooted in the lives and culture of the people and is a traditional national art unique to Japan, cultivated by the creativity of the people for more than three hundred years. Therefore, along with other national arts, it is one of the representative Japanese national arts. Moreover, it is a traditional national drama that is closely connected to Chinese Peking Opera and other classical dramas like brothers.

The above is a brief introduction to Kabuki. Below, I will discuss the plays performed by the Ichikawa Ennosuke Troupe, which is visiting China.

II. Kabuki Plays Performed in China

There are four plays being performed in China this time.

1. “Danmari” (Blind Fight) - One Act

"Danmari" is a type of historical play that contains elements of musical and dance drama. Danmari means pantomime, which is a performance form adopted by Kabuki since the middle of the Edo period (Tokugawa feudal government era).

This play is similar to the Chinese Peking Opera "San Cha Kou," depicting a fight in the dark. However, "San Cha Kou" showcases fierce martial arts, while this play showcases a gentle form of martial arts. This play was originally a scene from a multi-act drama, but later it became an independent opening act, serving as a promotional play to introduce the cast, characters, and costumes to the audience.

The scene is a deep mountain valley. After the curtain rises, two men fight and retreat while snatching a flag. Then, singers of "Nagauta" and players of the shamisen enter, singing a tune called "Dai-Satsuma," which is majestic and powerful, singing the scene’s atmosphere. After the song ends, the people on stage exit, and the curtain falls. Then, the scene of the deep mountain reappears, and various characters such as nobles, samurai, monks, young ladies, youths, and village girls enter, vying for the flag at the front while engaging in clandestine fights.

Finally, a Robin Hood-like hero emerges from a roadside shrine. He snatches the flag and walks alone towards the "Hanamichi" before the curtain closes ("Hanamichi" is an important part of the Kabuki stage, a long narrow path like a bridge extending from the stage to the audience, a stage structure unique to Kabuki). The Robin Hood hero uses "Roppō" (similar to the "Qiba" in Chinese Peking Opera) movements to leisurely exit through the Hanamichi, called a "curtain-out exit." "Danmari" is such a short play.

This Robin Hood hero is the protagonist of the play, played by the best actor in the troupe. Despite the presence of nobles and samurai, the person called the "chief of thieves" is victorious. My personal opinion is that one of the reasons why the citizens of the time welcomed this was perhaps that they saw this "chief of thieves" as representing themselves. In feudal and capitalist societies, as long as you resist the ruling class, even if you are just, you will be branded with a bad name. This "chief of thieves" is a hero who resists the feudal system, and this hero is an image of the citizens themselves. The "chief of thieves" completely disregards the samurai and nobles who oppress them, seizing the flag symbolizing the governance of the world and swaggering down the Hanamichi—this is precisely why the citizens of the time wholeheartedly welcomed him with enthusiastic applause. Perhaps the citizens of the time were not aware of this, but this emotion was hidden deep within their hearts. At the same time, because the "chief of thieves" is played by the best actor in the troupe, he is even more popular.

2. “Kanjinchō” (The Subscription List) - One Act

"Kanjinchō" also belongs to historical plays and contains musical drama, dance drama, and dialogue drama elements, as well as absorbing some expression forms from "Noh."

The first performance of "Kanjinchō" was in 1840. Originally, "Kanjinchō" was also an important play in the stage art of "Noh." "Noh" originated from Japanese folk traditions but was later monopolized by the feudal ruling warrior class, who forbade the people from watching it.

At that time, the famous actor the seventh Ichikawa Danjūrō and the writer the third Namiki Gohei put a lot of effort into creating Kabuki's "Kanjinchō." Legend has it that Danjūrō secretly infiltrated the "Goten" where the lords lived to secretly observe the performance of Noh's "Kanjinchō." "We cannot be inferior to the samurai's 'Noh'!" The masses and folk artists had such aspirations. Therefore, the script, performance, acting, music, and dance of Kabuki's "Kanjinchō" all reached outstanding levels and were seamlessly integrated into a unified stage art, which was extremely popular with the people. Since then, "Kanjinchō" has always been the top-ranked favorite in "Kabuki Jūhachiban" (the eighteen excellent dramas passed down by the Ichikawa Danjūrō family), and it continues to receive rave reviews every time it is performed. It is one of the most representative works of Kabuki.

"Kanjinchō" depicts a story from 1188-89. Minamoto no Yoritomo, who was in power, exiled his brother Yoshitsune, who, together with his retainer Benkei and four others, disguised themselves as "Yamabushi" (ascetics) and fled from Kyoto. The wise and brave Benkei disguised his master Yoshitsune as a "Gōriki" (a porter monk) and disguised himself as a "Dai-Sendatsu" (a senior monk) soliciting donations for the construction of "Tōdai-ji" temple, arriving at Ataka in Kaga Province.

The powerful local lord Togashi Saemon of Kaga received an order from Yoritomo stating that Yoshitsune was disguised as a Yamabushi, and any Yamabushi should be arrested. Therefore, a new checkpoint was set up in Ataka, and Togashi personally waited at the checkpoint with his retainers. The play "Kanjinchō" begins here.

Togashi questioned Benkei and his party who came to the checkpoint: "If you are truly Yamabushi, you must have a subscription list with the money you have solicited for the temple. Read the subscription list to me!"

"As you wish!" Benkei replied. But he didn't have any subscription list at all. Suddenly, he had a flash of inspiration and took out a scroll with nothing written on it, reciting it aloud from memory.

Togashi further questioned the methods of Yamabushi修行(Shugyo-austere practice of asceticism), and Benkei answered fluently. This "Yamabushi question-and-answer" session is a question-and-answer between Togashi (who vigilantly questions, ready to arrest if the other party answers a single sentence incorrectly) and the composed and decisive Benkei, and is the climax of the play. Although the content of the questions and answers is religious, it is not easy to understand, but thanks to the actors' years of research, we can hear the intense inner struggle from the changes in the tone of the dialogue.

Togashi is not easy to deal with, but Benkei's fluent answers make him admire him, and he finally lets them pass through the checkpoint.

Just then, Togashi's retainer tugged at his sleeve and told him that the porter monk looked very much like Yoshitsune. Togashi shouted loudly:

"That porter monk, stop!"

This is bad!—Yoshitsune's four retainers stepped forward to protect him.

"Don't panic!" Benkei stopped them. He walked closer to Togashi and scolded Yoshitsune, "You are always mistaken for Yoshitsune, you hateful thing!" He raised his monk's staff and struck Yoshitsune.

However, Togashi still does not let them pass through the checkpoint.

Yoshitsune's four retainers intend to break through the checkpoint, but Benkei stops them. Benkei is prepared that if words fail, he will have to defeat Togashi, while Togashi and his retainers hold their swords, ready to arrest Yoshitsune. Amid the majestic music, they glare at each other, which is the moment when sparks are about to fly. This scene is the highest point of stage action in the play.

Benkei is pretending to prepare to beat Yoshitsune to death in front of Togashi. Benkei's state of mind is truly like walking on thin ice, but Togashi sees through his plan.

However, the conscious and firm solidarity, courage, and endurance of Benkei and his party, who are willing to sacrifice themselves and fight for the dignity of those who are oppressed by the feudal rulers, finally move Togashi. Togashi, as a local powerful lord, also has conflicts with the ruler Yoritomo. Under these circumstances, he wavers, and his mood finally changes at this moment, and he lets Benkei and his party pass through the checkpoint.

This is the most important part of the play, because of the victory of solidarity, Benkei and Togashi are linked together. This is the central theme of this play.

After this, there is also Benkei's reflection, the "Ennen no Mai" (longevity dance), and scenes expressing Benkei's relaxed mood revealed in the struggle. Finally, he exits through the Hanamichi using "Tobi Roppō" movements. These will not be described in detail. The role of Benkei is one of the most difficult and demanding roles in Kabuki.

3. “The Stuttering Yosaburo”

"The Stuttering Yosaburo" is a scene from "Keisei Hangonkō" by Chikamatsu Monzaemon. It is a type of historical play called "Sewa-mono" (domestic play).

This is a musical play called "Jōruri," which also incorporates elements of dialogue drama, dance drama, and puppet drama.

To briefly describe its outline: The protagonist of the play is a painter named Ukiyo Yosaburo. He is an excellent painter, an honest and simple good person, but because of his humble origins, poor family, and stutter, he is looked down upon by the upper class, and even his teacher does not like him, and no one appreciates his excellent painting skills.

Yosaburo's wife, Otoku, is a considerate wife, gentle in nature, and no less capable than a man. She helps her husband and lives a poor life. In order to make up for her husband's inability to speak fluently, she always speaks for him, and unconsciously becomes a talkative woman.

The vivid contrast between the stuttering husband and the talkative wife is well depicted by Chikamatsu.

This couple opposes feudal oppression, opposes discrimination against people with disabilities and those of low status, and strives to maintain human dignity. Their determination and actions are cleverly expressed in the paintings. Therefore, Yosaburo's excellent skills are finally recognized by the people. This theme, under the pen of the excellent realist writer Chikamatsu, forms a bittersweet plot with a strong dramatic atmosphere.

This play has been performed repeatedly for more than two hundred years since it was first staged, and it has always been popular with the masses, especially when played by famous actors.

4. “Futari Dōjōji” (The Two Butterflies at Dōjōji Temple) - Dance Drama

The music is mainly "Nagauta," accompanied by shamisen. The plot is somewhat similar to the Chinese "Legend of the White Snake."

During the bell festival, two young girls come to Dōjōji Temple to worship, and they perform an interesting dance. However, one of these two is a man in disguise. He is actually a "Kyogen" (farce) actor. As they dance, the man dressed as a woman suddenly returns to his male attire, and then it becomes a dance for a man and a woman. Later, the girl enters the bell and comes out in the form of a snake, and the man runs away. The actor playing the male role quickly changes his costume, paints his face as a large mask, and fights with the snake. Finally, the curtain closes amid beautiful music.

The content of the singing draws on folk songs such as the popular folk song "Temari Uta" at the time, generally describing the feelings of love through street scenes. Matching the lyrics, the two dance.

This play is a representative work of Japanese classical dance.

III. Visiting Kabuki Artists from China

The head of the Kabuki troupe visiting China this time, Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke, is one of the leading artists among Japanese Kabuki actors today. He is 67 years old this year, but still has the vitality of a young man. When he was 24 or 25 years old, he went to Europe to visit. After returning to China, he staged the new dance drama "Mushi" (Bug) and the drama: Kikuchi Kan's "Chichi Kaeru" (Father Returns), and organized the "Shunju-za" troupe, which attracted attention and welcome in the theater world. In terms of dance, he is one of the leading masters in the Japanese theater world. Not long ago, he was elected as a member of the Japan Art Academy. When the news that the Kabuki troupe was invited to visit China came out, Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke said: "Art is not limited by region. If they want me to go, I will be happy to go." He expressed his willingness to work hard to promote cultural exchange.

The deputy head of the troupe, Mr. Ichikawa Chūsha, is Mr. Ennosuke's younger brother. He has excellent skills and is known as a newcomer in the Kabuki world. He is good at dancing and has unique characteristics.

Mr. Ichikawa Danshirō is Mr. Ennosuke's son and is good at dancing. Recently, he was praised by the audience for making movies, and he has visited the Soviet Union for performances.

Mr. Ichikawa Arajiro has excellent acting skills that are unmatched and is an important figure in the troupe. He is good at playing villains, comedians, and old men. In 1928, he went to the Soviet Union with his predecessor, Mr. Ichikawa Sadanji, and at that time the Soviet Union gave great praise to Japanese Kabuki. He is probably 67 years old this year.

Mr. Kataoka Gado and Mr. Ichikawa Matsutora are both actors who have received good reviews for playing female roles. Like Chinese Peking Opera, male actors playing female roles are particularly popular in Japanese Kabuki. Both of them are newcomers who are emerging in the Kabuki world.

Mr. Iwai Hanshirō can play both male and female roles. This specialty and his beautiful figure are both appreciated by the audience. He is a young actor.

Mr. Ichikawa Yaozō is also a recognized famous actor due to his excellent acting skills.

The other actors are also very good. There are also many excellent figures among the musicians.

This is the second time that Japanese Kabuki has performed abroad as an international cultural exchange. In 1928, at the invitation of the Soviet Union, the late Mr. Ichikawa Sadanji and his party of 48 performed in Moscow and received great praise. It has been 27 years now.

The seniors and friends who grew up with Kabuki are visiting China this time with the mission of cultural exchange, and I cannot help but feel happy to be able to introduce Kabuki theater to Chinese readers.

I am grateful for the efforts of Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke and his party, and I am also deeply grateful to the people of China and Japan. It is the strength of the people of both countries that made such cultural exchanges a reality.

    日本传统的民族戏剧——歌舞伎
    日本中村翫右卫门
      一、日本歌舞伎
    歌舞伎来自日本民间，最初是一种以歌唱和舞蹈为主的民间艺术。
    歌舞伎在一六○三年出现后，受到了人民的热烈欢迎。其后它虽然遭到德川封建政府的压迫，但还是按着人民的愿望在发展，而到元禄时代，即一六八八年左右，形成为完整的戏剧形式。元禄时代，正是日本新兴的市民阶级逐步成长起来的时期。这
  一时期，从人民中出现了优秀的作家、艺术家、学者，留下了许多优秀作品。后世称之为“元禄文化”、“市民文化”。这是日本民族文化史上最光辉的时代之一。这时期的歌舞伎，也被称为“元禄歌舞伎”。由于优秀的现实主义作家——被誉为日本莎士比亚的近松门左卫门的充满着人道主义精神的剧作，日本舞台上开始出现了反映当时社会生活的戏剧。同时还出现了创始现实主义演技的坂田藤十郎等名演员。可以说，歌舞伎是在这个时代奠定了它的基础的。
    然而，自元禄时代中叶以来，德川封建政府采取了锁国政策，禁止对外贸易，对市民阶级加强了压力，堵塞了市民阶级发展经济的出路，市民阶级逐渐走上了和封建政府妥协的道路。明治维新以后，也没有能彻底地进行民主革命，一面同封建制度妥协着，一面开始了近代资本主义化的过程，并且很快就进入了帝国主义阶段。
    歌舞伎也受了这种影响，带着互相缠结在一起的封建性和人民性的矛盾，在人民的爱护和滋养下，生根于人民的生活中，一直到了现在。其间经历了大约三百多年的时光。直到现在，歌舞伎在日本戏剧中还是拥有最多观众的一个剧种。它能够直到今天还受到人民的支持的最大原因，是下述的两点：
    第一，是歌舞伎在封建的压迫下保存下来的人民性的一面。以元禄时代的近松门左卫门为先驱，竹田出云、并木宗辅、近松半二、近松柳等优秀的“木偶净琉璃剧”作家们，艺人们，以及并木五瓶、梅田治助、河村默阿弥、冈木奇堂等优秀的剧作家，歌舞伎的艺术家们，在他们的一系列的作品中，真实地描述了人民在封建制度束缚中的苦闷，或者贯穿着对封建制度的反抗精神。我们从他们的作品中，可以看出那种维护人性的人道主义、努力描写真实的现实主义的萌芽。
    第二，是人民所创造的歌舞伎的优美的民族艺术形式。日本歌舞伎吸收音乐、舞蹈、道白、象征、写实等等各种戏剧表现手法，融合发展而成为完美的舞台艺术，只经过了短短几百年的时间，而且是在锁国期间的条件下成长起来的。从这点来看，也可以看出人民的创造力是如何地丰富。这种由人民的丰富创造力培植起来的优美的舞台艺术，人民对它的喜爱和它对人民的吸引力，就是歌舞伎所以不能被消灭的另一个主要原因。
    我看了中国的戏剧，感到中国戏剧具有悠久历史，由于人民丰富的创造力，发展成了优美的完整的艺术。然而，其中也是并含着封建性和人民性。因此，对它不是无批判地接受，而是舍弃它的封建性的糟粕、发扬它的人民性的精华。这些经验，虽然国家的条件不同，但我认为是日本歌舞伎今后在前进的道路上应该吸取的重要经验。同时，“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，对于日本今后的整个戏剧运动来说，也可以作为指针，值得认真地学习。
    现在日本的文化，有被美国颓废文化淹没的危险，日本的民族传统文化正处在被轻视、受破坏的状态。但是，以工人阶级为中心的为争取和平、独立、民主而斗争的正在增长着的日本人民的力量，并没有忽视这种状态。日本人民正日益关心保卫民族文化。我们坚信，不管是在今天或在明天，日本人民有力量维护民族文化，使之向正确的方向发展。
    在这样情况下，日本歌舞伎能够访问中国，意义是非常深刻的。我们必须感谢中国朋友们。因为中国的民族戏剧贯穿着为人民服务的精神，它的人民性得到了发展，正在沿着社会主义现实主义道路不断前进，从而为我们提供了学习的榜样。
    总括起来说，日本歌舞伎是汇合了日本民间的种种艺术，并且吸取了从中国传去的民间艺术而形成的舞台艺术。它深深地生根在人民的生活和文化之中，是人民的创造力培植起来的、经历了三百多年的日本固有的传统的民族艺术。所以，它和其他民族艺术一起，是有代表性的日本民族艺术之一。而且，它是和中国京剧及其他古典戏剧血肉相连、弟兄一样地非常相似的传统的民族戏剧。
    以上简单地介绍了歌舞伎，下面我谈谈这次访问中国的歌舞伎——市川猿之助剧团上演的几个戏。
    二、在中国上演的歌舞伎剧这次在中国演出的，有四个戏。
    一、“默”（暗斗）一幕“默”是历史剧的一种，含有音乐剧和舞剧的成分。默剧就是哑剧，这是江户时代（德川封建政府时代）中叶以来歌舞伎所采用的一种表演形式。
    这出戏，同中国京剧“三岔口”类似，表演的是在黑暗中的格斗。不过“三岔口”所表演的是激烈的武技，而这出戏所表演的则是一种柔缓的武技。这出戏，最初本是多幕剧中的一折，后来独立出来成为开场戏，成为向观众介绍演员阵容、介绍演员的角色和服装等等的一种宣传剧。
    场面是深山幽谷。幕开后，两个男人一面抢夺着旗子一面格斗着退场。接着，唱“长呗”和弹三弦的上场，他们唱的调子叫做“大萨摩”，曲调雄壮有力，是歌唱这个场面的情景的，三弦弹奏的是独特的曲调。曲终，台上的人退场后，落幕。接着，台上又现出深山的场面，贵族、武士、僧侣、大家闺秀、青年、村姑等各种各样的人物出场，夺取最前面的旗子，而在暗中相互格斗。
    最后，从路旁的神社中出来一个绿林英雄。他夺去了旗子，独自向“花道”走去而闭幕（“花道”是歌舞伎舞台重要的一部分，它是从舞台通到观众席上的像桥一样的狭长的道路，是歌舞伎特有的舞台结构）。绿林英雄用“六法”（类如中国京剧中的“起霸”）身段，从容地由花道退场，这叫做“幕外退场”。“默”就是这样一个短剧。
    这个绿林英雄是戏中的主角，由剧团中最好的演员扮演。虽有贵族和武士在场，还是被称作盗首的人取得了胜利。我个人的看法是：当时的市民欢迎这点的理由之一，也许是把这“盗首”看成是代表自己的。在封建社会、资本主义社会中，只要反抗统治阶级，即便是正义的，也要被加上恶名。这个“盗首”是反抗封建制度的英雄，这英雄是市民们自己的形象。“盗首”把压迫他们的武士、贵族完全不放在眼里，夺得了象征治理天下的大旗，大摇大摆地走上花道的姿态，正是这一点，是当时市民观众由衷欢迎而报以热烈掌声的吧。也许当时的市民观众并没有意识到这点，而只是在他们心的深处隐然地藏着这种情感。同时由于“盗首”是由剧团中最好的演员扮演的，就更加受人欢迎了。
    二、“劝进帐”（化绿簿）一幕“化绿簿”，也属于历史剧，含有音乐剧、舞剧和道白剧的成分，并且还吸取了“能”的某些表现形式。
      “化缘簿”的首次公演，是在一八四○年。本来，“化缘簿”在“能”这种舞台艺术中，也是重要的一出戏。“能”原是日本民间的东西，后来为封建统治者武士阶级所独占，禁止人民观看。 
    当时的名演员七代市川团十郎和作家三代并木五瓶，为了创作歌舞伎的“化缘簿”，曾下了很大工夫。传说团十郎曾秘密潜入诸候居住的“御殿”，偷偷观摩“能”的“化缘簿”的演出。“不能比武士的‘能’逊色！”群众和民间的艺术家都有这样的抱负，因此，歌舞伎“化缘簿”的剧本、演出、演技、音乐、舞蹈等，都达到了杰出的水平，而且混然一体地融合在统一的舞台艺术中，受到了人民极大的欢迎。以后，“化缘簿”一直是“歌舞伎十八番”（市川团十郎家传的十八种优秀戏剧）中的头一出拿手好戏，直到今天，仍然每演必获好评。它是歌舞伎里最具有代表性的作品之一。
      “化缘簿”的内容是描写一一八八、八九年的故事。为当政的源赖朝所放逐的他的兄弟义经，带同家将弁庆和其他四人一起，化装为“山伏”（头陀），从京都逃出。智勇双全的弁庆让主人义经化装成“刚力”（供驱使的和尚），而把自己装扮成为了修建“东大寺”庙宇募化的“大先达”（大和尚），来到了加贺国的安宅地方。
    加贺的豪族富樫左卫门，奉到赖朝的命令，说是义经化装成山伏，看到山伏就要逮捕起来。因而在安宅新设了关门，富樫带着他的家将，亲自把关等待。“化缘簿”这出戏就是从这里开始的。
    富樫查询看来到关门前面的弁庆一行人：“真是山伏，一定带有募化修庙钱款的化缘簿，把化缘簿念给我听！”
      “遵命！”弁庆答道。可是他根本没有带什么化缘簿。他突然灵机一动，拿出一卷什么也没有写的卷轴，凭着记忆，高声诵读起来。
    富樫进一步追问山伏修行的方法，弁庆对答如流。这一场“山伏问答”，是富樫（他在机警地盘问着，如果对方答错了一句，他马上就要动手抓人的）和沉着果敢的弁庆之间的一问一答，是这出戏里的高潮。虽然问答的内容是宗教的宗法，不容易听懂，但是由于演员多年的钻研，从对话的声调的变化上，我们可以听出那种内心的激烈斗争。
    富樫不是好对付的，但是弁庆的应答如流，连他也不能不佩服，而终于放他们过关了。
    就在这时候，富樫的家将拉他的袖子告诉他：那个刚力很像义经。富樫大声喝道：
    “那个刚力，休走！”
    大事不好！——义经的四个家将一齐上前围护着他。
    “不必惊慌！”弁庆止住他们，他一面走近富樫，一面向义经骂道：“你总是被人错看成义经，你这可恶的东西！”举起禅杖就打义经。
    然而富樫仍不放他们过关。
    义经的四名家将打算闯过关去，弁庆一面拦住他们，一面准备着万一话不投机，就得打倒富樫，而富樫和他手下的家将又拿着大刀逼上前来准备逮捕义经，在雄壮的音乐声中，他们怒目相对，这正是将要迸发火花的一瞬间。这个场面，是戏里的舞台动作上的最高潮。
    弁庆在富樫面前正装着准备打死义经。弁庆的心境真是如履薄冰，然而富樫识破了他的计谋。
    但是，弁庆一行人的自觉的坚定的团结力量、勇敢和忍耐，不惜牺牲自己对压迫他们的封建统治者斗争的人的尊严，终于使富樫受到感动。富樫，作为地方上的豪族，同统治者赖朝也有着矛盾。在这种情况下，他动摇了，终于在这一瞬间心情起了变化，他放弁庆等人过了关。
    这是这出戏内容最重要的地方，由于团结的胜利，弁庆和富樫连结在一起了。这是这个戏的中心主题。
    这以后还有弁庆的述怀，“延年舞”以及表现在斗争中显出悠闲的弁庆的心境等等场面，最后是用“飞六法”的身段从花道退场。这些，就不一一详述了。弁庆这个角色，是歌舞伎里最难演最吃重的一个角色。
    三、“口吃的又平”
    “口吃的又平”是近松门左卫门作“倾城返魂香”中的一场。是历史剧中叫作“世话剧”的一种（世话剧意即社会剧）。
    这是名为“净琉璃剧”的音乐剧，其中也吸取了道白剧、舞剧和木偶剧的成分。
    简单地说一下它的梗概：戏中的主人公是一个叫做浮世又平的画匠。他是一个优秀的画家，是一个诚实而纯朴的好人，但是，因为出身低微、家境贫寒，而且由于口吃、说话结结巴巴，所以被上层人物看不起，连他的师父也不中意他，更没有人赏识他的优秀的绘画技术。
    又平的妻子阿德，是个体贴丈夫、性情温柔、而且能力不亚于男子的妇女。她帮助丈夫，过着贫穷的日子，为了弥补丈夫口齿不灵的缺点，总是代他讲话，不知不觉就变成了个嘴碎的妇女了。
    口齿不灵的丈夫和喜欢多嘴的妻子，这种日常生活里的鲜明的对照，在近松的笔下得到了很好的描绘。
    这一对夫妻反对封建压迫，反对对残废人和身分低下者的轻视，尽力维护人的尊严，他们的决心和行动在画中巧妙地表现了出来，因而，又平的优良技术终于为人们公认了。这个主题在优秀的现实主义作家近松的笔下，构成了亦悲亦喜的情节，有着浓厚的戏剧气氛。
    这出戏自开始上演到现在，已有二百多年，这中间不断反复地演出，再加上由名角扮演，一直是深受群众欢迎的。
    四、“双蝶道成寺”舞剧
    音乐主要是“长呗”，由三弦伴奏。情节有些像中国的“白蛇传”。
    在钟节，两个少女前来道成寺参拜，他们跳着有趣的舞蹈。可是，这两人中有一个是男子乔装，他实际是“狂言”（谐剧）的演员。跳着跳着，那个男扮女装的，突然恢复男装，而后就成为男女二人的舞蹈。后来，少女进入钟内，变成蛇形出来了，男的逃去。男演角的演员迅速改装，扮成大花脸，和蛇格斗。最后，在优美的音乐声中闭幕。
    歌唱的内容，吸取了当时的民间流行歌“手鞠呗”等民谣，大体是通过街头风景述说恋爱的心情的。配合着歌词，两个人跳着舞。
    这出戏是日本古典舞蹈的代表作。
      三、访问中国的歌舞伎艺
          术家
    这次访问中国的歌舞伎剧团的座长、市川猿之助先生，是现在日本歌舞伎演员中首屈一指的艺术家。他今年六十七岁了，但仍然有着年轻人的活力。他在二十四、五岁时前往欧洲参观，回国后，上演新舞剧：“虫”，话剧：菊池宽的“父归”，组织“春秋座”剧团，受到戏剧界的注目和欢迎。在舞蹈方面，他是日本戏剧界有数的大师之一，不久前，他被推选为日本艺术院会员。当歌舞伎剧团应邀访问中国的消息传出后，市川猿之助先生说：“艺术不受地域的限制，希望我去，我就高兴地去。”他表示要努力促进文化交流。
    剧团副团长市川中车先生，是猿之助先生的弟弟。他有着优秀的技艺，被誉为歌舞伎界的新人。他擅长舞蹈，有独到的特色。
    市川段四郎先生是猿之助先生的儿子，擅长舞蹈。最近拍摄电影获得观众好评，他曾赴苏联作访问演出。
    市川荒次郎先生有着人所不及的优秀的演技，是剧团的重要人物。他擅演反派、丑角、老生等。一九二八年曾随先代市川左团次先生赴苏联演出，当时苏联对日本的歌舞伎给予极大的好评。今年大概六十七岁了。
    片冈我童和市川松茑先生，都是男扮旦角获有好评的演员。和中国京剧同样，日本歌舞伎男扮旦角是特别盛行的。他们两人都是后进的在歌舞伎界显露头角的旦角。
    岩井半四郎先生能扮男女两种角色，他的这种特长和他的优美的身姿，同为观众所欣赏，是位年轻的演员。
    市川八百藏先生由于演技的卓越，也是公认的名演员。
    其他演员也都是很优秀的。音乐家里面也有许多优秀的人物。
    日本歌舞伎作为国际文化交流到国外演出，这是第二次。一九二八年应苏联邀请，先代市川左团次先生一行四十八人在莫斯科演出，获得了极大好评，到现在已经有二十七年了。
    和歌舞伎一起成长的先辈们、朋友们，这次负着文化交流的使命来访问中国，我能够向中国读者介绍歌舞伎戏剧，胸中禁不住喜悦。
    我感激市川猿之助先生一行的努力，我也深深感谢中日两国人民，是两国人民的力量，使这样的文化交流获得实现的。（附图片）“劝进帐” 　英韬速写“双蝶道成寺”英韬速写
