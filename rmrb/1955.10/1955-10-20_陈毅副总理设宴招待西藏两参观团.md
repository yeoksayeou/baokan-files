At present, our country is gradually advancing along the socialist path, and the people of all ethnic groups across the country are working enthusiastically and actively to realize our country's first Five-Year Plan.

In March of this year, the Seventh Plenary Meeting of the State Council adopted the decision on various constructions in Tibet. I firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our Tibetan people can move towards a bright road of prosperity and happiness, and are determined to do a good job in Tibet's construction undertakings.

    Lhalu Tsewang Dorje said: We firmly believe that with the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the State Council, the strong support of the people of all ethnic groups across the country, the help of the People's Liberation Army and personnel stationed in Tibet, and under the guidance of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, and further strengthening close unity with all fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland, we will surely achieve brilliant achievements in the construction of the motherland and the new Tibet.
