Enterprises under the Iron and Steel Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry have exceeded the state production plan for the third quarter. The total output value of the bureau in the third quarter was 103.65% of the plan, and the labor productivity plan, cost reduction plan, and profit delivery plan were all overfulfilled. Among the five major products, except for pig iron, which completed 99.97% of the plan, the output of iron ore, metallurgical coke, steel, and rolled steel all exceeded the state plan.

In the third quarter, the broad masses of workers and staff of enterprises under the Iron and Steel Administration Bureau actively studied and promoted advanced Soviet experience, worked hard to improve the utilization of major production equipment, and improved operating skills, so that the production level was generally further improved. In terms of blast furnace production, due to the continuous strengthening of raw material management, the implementation of furnace top regulation, and the stabilization of furnace conditions, the effective volume utilization coefficient of the bureau's blast furnaces increased by 3.01% compared with the second quarter. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Chongqing No. 1 Steel Plant and other plants tested the smelting of low-manganese steel-making pig iron, creating favorable conditions for saving the country's manganese ore resources and reducing the cost of pig iron. In terms of steelmaking production, the daily calendar utilization coefficient of the open hearth furnace bottom area of ​​the bureau increased by 5.9% compared with the second quarter. In the third quarter, various steelmaking production units continued to promote the advanced experience of "thick-layer burning and repairing furnace bottoms" of the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Plant in the Soviet Union, and the burning and repairing furnace bottom time of the bureau was reduced by another 6.7% compared with the second quarter. Some enterprises have strengthened thermal control and improved air supply, shortening the smelting time of open hearth furnaces. In the cold repair work of open hearth furnaces, Tianjin Steel Plant created a new record in the third quarter for the shortest cold repair time for medium-sized open hearth furnaces, using only 94 hours and 6 minutes. In terms of rolling steel, some enterprises actively improved operating skills and reduced equipment accidents, which reduced temporary downtime and increased operating time. The operating time of Tianjin Steel Plant, Tangshan Steel Plant, and Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant in the third quarter increased by 366 hours compared with the plan, increasing the country's steel production by about 4,000 tons. Some enterprises improved production equipment and operating skills in the third quarter, which increased the machine-hour output of rolled steel compared with the past. For example, taking the average machine-hour output of the month with the highest output in the second quarter as 100, the average machine-hour output of Chongqing No. 1 Steel Plant rolling 24 kg light rails in September was 152, and the average machine-hour output of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant rolling 8 kg light rails was 124.

In the third quarter, the enterprises under the Iron and Steel Administration Bureau also successfully trial-produced new products such as arc-shaped agricultural tool steel, which supplied the needs of national economic construction and national defense construction.

    钢铁局所属企业超额完成第三季度计划
    重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业超额完成了第三季度的国家生产计划。全局第三季度生产总值完成计划百分之一百零三点六五，劳动生产率计划、成本降低计划、利润上缴计划都超额完成。五种主要产品中，除生铁完成计划百分之九十九点九七外，铁矿石、冶金焦、钢、钢压延品的产量都超额完成了国家计划。
    钢铁工业管理局所属企业广大职工在第三季度积极学习和推广苏联先进经验，努力改进主要生产设备的利用情况，提高操作技术，使生产水平普遍进一步提高。在高炉生产方面，由于继续加强原料管理，推行炉顶调剂，稳定炉况，全局高炉有效容积利用系数比第二季度提高百分之三点零一。太原钢铁厂、重庆第一钢铁厂等试炼低锰炼钢生铁，为节约国家锰矿资源和降低生铁成本创造了有利条件。在炼钢生产方面，全局平炉炉底面积日历利用系数比第二季度提高了百分之五点九。各炼钢生产单位在第三季度继续推行苏联库滋涅茨克钢铁厂的“厚层烧补炉底”先进经验，全局烧补炉底时间比第二季度又缩短了百分之六点七。部分企业加强了热工控制，改善了送风情况，使平炉熔炼时间较前缩短。平炉冷修工作中，天津钢厂在第三季度创造了中型平炉中冷修时间仅用九十四小时零六分的全局新纪录。在轧钢方面，部分企业积极改进操作技术，减少设备事故，使临时停工时间减少，作业时间增多。天津钢厂、唐山钢厂和重庆第三钢铁厂三个单位第三季度的作业时间，比计划增加三百六十六小时，约为国家增产钢材四千吨。有些企业在第三季度改进了生产设备和操作技术，使轧制钢材的机时产量比过去有了提高。如以第二季度产量最高月份的平均机时产量为一百，九月份重庆第一钢铁厂轧制二十四公斤轻轨的平均机时产量为一百五十二，上海第三钢厂轧制八公斤轻轨的平均机时产量为一百二十四。
    第三季度内，钢铁工业管理局所属企业还试制成功了弧形农具钢等新产品，供应了国家经济建设和国防建设的需要。
