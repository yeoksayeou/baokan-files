Hunan Monopoly Company Achieves Success in Mildew Prevention

    The Hunan Provincial Monopoly Corporation has done an early and good job of preventing mildew this year; 58 county-level companies and fixed wholesale groups in the entire system have not had a single cigarette damaged by mildew, and 42 warehouses have been mildew-free.

    As soon as the second quarter began, when the Shaoyang Special District Monopoly Company first discovered mildew warnings, the Provincial Company immediately established a mildew prevention office and organized five mildew prevention technical working groups. These groups went to various special and county companies to help grassroots storage units establish and improve storage systems and promote the use of lime for moisture absorption and drying in warehouses; they also set up small, simple drying rooms to prevent damp cigarettes from becoming moldy.

    Many county-level companies and wholesale groups in the Monopoly Company not only properly stored their existing cigarettes but also actively assisted district and branch supply and marketing cooperatives in their storage work. For example, the Yuanjiang County Company regularly had four staff members assisting in mildew prevention during the mildew season, allowing them to purchase goods with confidence.

    In this year's mildew prevention work, the entire Monopoly Company system basically made it through the mildew season safely, gloriously fulfilling the guarantee of "not having a single cigarette damaged by mildew." (Liu Mingxi)

    湖南专卖公司防霉工作有成绩
    湖南省专卖事业公司今年的防霉工作做得早也做得好；全系统有五十八个县公司和固定批发组没有霉损一条烟，其中出现四十二个无霉仓库。
    第二季度刚开始，邵阳专区专卖公司首先发现霉警时，省公司立即成立防霉办公室，组织了五个防霉技术工作组，先后到各专、县公司，配合基层保管单位建立和健全保管制度，推广库房石灰吸潮干燥办法；并设立小型简易烘房，制止潮烟霉变。
    专卖公司很多县公司和批发组，不但保管好了所存卷烟，还积极协助区、分供销社做好了保管工作。如沅江县公司经常有四个工作人员在霉季协助防止霉变，使能放手进货。
    专卖公司全系统在今年的防霉工作中，基本上做到了安度霉季，光荣地完成了“不霉损一条烟”的保证。　　　　（刘明曦）
