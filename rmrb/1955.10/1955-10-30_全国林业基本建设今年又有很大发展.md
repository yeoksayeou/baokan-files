National forestry basic construction has achieved significant development again this year. The Ministry of Forestry has constructed 461 kilometers of forest railways within fourteen forest industry bureaus this year. After the completion of these forest railways, the proportion of mechanized timber transportation in forest industries will greatly increase. Forest railway transportation will account for more than 63% of the total transportation volume. At the same time, the transportation cost per cubic meter of timber by railway will be more than two yuan lower than that by truck.

With the state's ever-increasing need for timber production, the Ministry of Forestry will add more than 600 tractors, more than 150 loaders, and several river-clearing machines to forest industrial enterprises in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Changbai Mountains this year, bringing the mechanization of timber collection in forest industries to 17%, an increase of 161% compared to 1954.

Mechanized timber harvesting has also seen great development this year. Taking the Shuangzih River Forest Industry Bureau as an example, mechanized harvesting reached 91% this year, an increase of 9% compared to 1954. The Ministry of Forestry has also constructed five large-scale timber storage yards, including Yuzhu and Yueyang, this year. The Yuzhu timber storage yard has an area of 330,000 square meters and is equipped with flatcar lines, railway sidings, river-clearing machines, power equipment, etc., with an annual throughput of more than 500,000 cubic meters of timber. In addition, 140,000 square meters of housing were built in forest areas across the country this year, along with theaters, cinemas, hospitals, nurseries, and schools for children, improving the lives of forest workers.

    全国林业基本建设今年又有很大发展
    全国林业基本建设今年又有了很大发展。林业部今年在十四个森林工业局内修建了四百六十一公里森林铁路。这些森林铁路建成后将使森林工业机械化运材比重大大增长，森林铁路运材将占整个运材比重百分之六十三以上，同时铁路运材每立方公尺木材运输成本也比汽车运材降低二元多。
    随着国家对木材生产日益增长的需要，林业部今年将在大、小兴安岭、长白山森林工业企业中，增加六百多台拖拉机、一百五十多台装车机和数台出河机，使森林工业集材机械化达到百分之十七，比一九五四年提高百分之一百六十一。
    木材采伐机械化今年也有很大的发展。其中仅以双子河森林工业局为例，今年采伐机械化达百分之九十一，比一九五四年增长百分之九。林业部今年还修建了鱼珠、岳阳等五个大型贮木场。鱼珠贮木场场地面积达三十三万平方公尺，内有平车线路、铁道专用线、出河机、动力等设备，每一年可吞吐木材五十多万立方公尺以上。此外，在全国各林区内今年还修建了十四万平方公尺住宅；修建了戏院、电影院，医院，托儿所，子弟学校等，改善了林区职工生活。　（梅凤祥）
