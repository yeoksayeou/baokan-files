Language and writing are tools for people to exchange ideas, and also tools for social struggle and social development. The People's Republic of China has achieved an unprecedented level of unity and is now launching a surge of socialist construction and socialist transformation. Therefore, vigorously promoting Mandarin among the Han people, who make up more than 90% of the population, and promoting the reform of writing and the standardization of language have become pressing tasks for our country. The Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Writing Reform Committee convened the "National Conference on Writing Reform," which was held for nine days starting on October 15th. From October 25th, the Chinese Academy of Sciences also convened the "Academic Conference on the Standardization of Modern Chinese." These two conferences marked the beginning of the work of Chinese character reform and Chinese language standardization.

Chinese is one of the most developed and important languages ​​in the world. Chinese characters, the writing symbols of Chinese, are one of the oldest and most influential scripts. Everyone admits that Chinese characters have made great contributions to the long cultural history of our people. For thousands of years, the rich ancient documents and classics of our country have been preserved thanks to Chinese characters. In the future, during the period of socialist construction and transformation in our country, Chinese characters will still be used more extensively by the broad masses of people. Even in the distant future, Chinese characters will continue to exist and be studied by many people. However, it cannot be denied that Chinese characters have serious shortcomings, which bring great difficulties to learning and use. Due to the difficulty in recognizing, writing, and remembering Chinese characters, ordinary education in our country has to spend much more time on teaching writing. Chinese characters are a heavy burden in children's education, adult education, and literacy campaigns. If the status quo of Chinese characters is maintained without reform, it will seriously hinder the popularization and improvement of people's cultural education, and it will also be very detrimental to the country's industrialization and the development of the national economy.

Our Party has always attached importance to the work of writing reform. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out as early as in "On New Democracy": "Writing must be reformed under certain conditions, and language must be close to the people." The direction and goals of writing reform are also clear. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed in 1951: The reform of writing should follow the common phonetic direction of world writing; but before the realization of phoneticization, Chinese characters must first be simplified to facilitate current application, and at the same time, various research and preparatory work for phoneticization should be carried out.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, language workers and writing reform workers, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, first drafted a draft plan for the simplification of Chinese characters, which was released by the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Writing Reform Committee in January this year, and launched mass discussions across the country. At the same time, the press and publishing circles jointly selected the 141 most popular simplified characters, divided them into two batches, and first tried them out in major newspapers, magazines, and books. The results of discussions and trials have proved that simplified Chinese characters are urgently needed by the broad masses of people. The Chinese Writing Reform Committee collected and sorted out the opinions put forward by the masses, revised the original draft plan, and proposed the "Revised Draft Plan for the Simplification of Chinese Characters" and the "Draft of the First Batch of Variant Character Arrangement Table." After careful discussion and proposing revisions, the National Conference on Writing Reform adopted the above two draft plans and recommended that the Chinese Writing Reform Committee submit them to the State Council for examination and approval for implementation. The conference also agreed to the Chinese Writing Reform Committee's proposed policy of "following established customs and making steady progress" and the method of gradually simplifying in batches. After the promulgation of this simplification plan, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee will continue to collect mass opinions and continue to carry out the simplification and arrangement of Chinese characters.

The main purpose of the simplification of Chinese characters is to simplify the strokes of Chinese characters, reduce the number of characters, and gradually achieve fixed shapes and fixed numbers of Chinese characters, so as to facilitate the learning and use of Chinese characters. However, the simplification of Chinese characters is not the fundamental reform of writing. To further carry out the phoneticization of writing, it is necessary to do a series of investigations, research, and other preparatory work. The most urgent task at present is to promote the common language of the Han nationality, and at the same time strive for the further standardization of the Chinese language.

The oral language of the Han nationality is currently in the following situation: on the one hand, the dialects of Chinese are diverse, and the regional differences are very large; on the other hand, the Han nationality has gradually formed a national common language. This common language of the Han nationality is Mandarin, which is based on Northern dialects and uses Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation. It is necessary to promote this Mandarin to all parts of the country, use it universally, and make Mandarin have clear norms in terms of phonetics, grammar, and vocabulary, so that Chinese writing can smoothly embark on the road of phoneticization. Conversely, without a clearly defined national common language, phonetic writing lacks a definite foundation; if the national common language is not actively promoted, the implementation of phonetic writing will encounter great difficulties.

The work of promoting Mandarin and standardizing the Chinese language is inseparable from the work of writing reform. However, promoting Mandarin and realizing the standardization of the Chinese language is by no means only for the sake of writing reform. Whether it is to strengthen the political, economic, and cultural unity of the Han nationality, to smoothly carry out socialist construction, to fully exert the communicative function of language in social life, or even to effectively develop inter-ethnic and international contacts and solidarity work, it is necessary to clarify the norms of the common language of the Han nationality and promote it to the whole nation. This is completely in line with the current urgent needs of the whole nation, and it is also completely in line with the actual situation of the historical development of the Chinese language.

The development process of the Chinese language is very tortuous and complex. We once used "Classical Chinese" as a unified written language for a long time, leaving behind rich documents. This written language must have been originally based on spoken language, but later the distance from spoken language became farther and farther, making it very difficult to learn. Only a very small number of people in the whole nation could use it. Therefore, another written language directly related to spoken language had to rise up to compete with "Classical Chinese." This is the "Vernacular Chinese" that we later talked about, which is also the main source of the written form of our current national common language. Since the Song and Yuan dynasties, works of various genres written in "Vernacular Chinese" have emerged in endlessly, producing many literary masterpieces. Although the language of these works all carries regional characteristics to a greater or lesser extent, on the whole, the dialect base of most of them is the Northern dialects, which have long dominated Chinese. These works also spread to non-Northern dialect areas, and authors in non-Northern dialect areas also used this "Vernacular Chinese" to create, which provided favorable conditions for the promotion of Northern dialects. As for the oral language, approximately at the same time as the widespread circulation of these "Vernacular Chinese" literary works, Northern dialects represented by Beijing dialect gradually acquired the status of a communicative tool between dialect areas and were called "Mandarin," but its development speed lagged behind vernacular literature. At the beginning of this century, with the rise of the national democratic revolution, the long-term formation process of our national common language began to accelerate, and social reformers put forward the proposition of "unity of spoken and written language." The "May Fourth" Movement opposed Classical Chinese and advocated Vernacular Chinese, shaking the dominant position of Classical Chinese. The "National Language Movement" and "Phonetic Alphabet" were once promoted by government decrees, and the promotion of Latinized New Writing also played a certain role in promoting Northern dialects. These successive movements reflected the fact that the common language of the Han nationality was accelerating its formation in a unified form of written and spoken language. The name "Mandarin" gradually replaced "Official Language," which was also determined by this fact.

Since liberation, the rapid development of politics and economy has promoted the changes in the Chinese language and improved the social communicative efficiency of language. In terms of spoken language, the number of people who can speak Mandarin is increasing day by day, and the desire for Mandarin to be close to Beijing pronunciation in terms of phonetics is also becoming stronger and stronger. The written language has basically been unified in "Vernacular Chinese," reaching the "unity of spoken and written language" in principle. Moreover, the number of people who can write and read is increasing, and the written language is constantly improving its precision and richness on the basis of spoken language, and at the same time, it is playing a role in concentrating and improving the development of spoken language.

Our Party has always attached importance to the purity of language. Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly and clearly instructed in his works how we should learn languages ​​well, and his works themselves are models of using language. Since liberation, the Party and the government have done a lot of work for the healthy development of language. In recent years, our linguists and language teachers have enthusiastically participated in the research and discussion of modern Chinese; state organs and troops have universally carried out grammar learning; broadcasters and theater workers have begun to pay attention to correct pronunciation training; the press and publishing circles have also strengthened the work of text editing. These practical actions have embodied the language policy of the Party and the government to varying degrees and in different aspects. It is also under these favorable political conditions that we have put forward the task of further standardizing the Chinese language.

The National Conference on Writing Reform has passed an important resolution to vigorously promote Mandarin, the common language of the Han nationality. The "Academic Conference on the Standardization of Modern Chinese" will also explore the further standardization of the Chinese language from an academic perspective. In order to complete this important task, we need to carry out a lot of work.

First of all, it is necessary to vigorously publicize the importance of promoting Mandarin. People should correctly understand the relationship between Mandarin and dialects. Mandarin serves the whole nation, while dialects serve the people of a region. Promoting Mandarin does not mean artificially eliminating dialects, but gradually narrowing the scope of use of dialects, which is in line with the objective laws of social progress. Dialects can and will coexist with Mandarin for a considerable period of time, but the scope of application of Mandarin must be continuously expanded. We must do our best to advocate speaking Mandarin in public, do our best to advocate using Mandarin in written language, correct the narrow-minded local concepts that do not recognize Mandarin, do not want to listen to Mandarin, and even do not allow children to speak Mandarin, and correct the phenomenon of abusing dialects in publications, especially in literary works.

We must urge everyone who speaks and writes, especially those who have a demonstrative effect on the use of language, to pay attention to the purity and health of the language. The norms of language must be entrusted to tangible things. This is first of all all works, especially literary works, because the norms of language are mainly spread through works. The extent to which writers and translators attach importance to or do not attach importance to the norms of language is difficult to estimate, and we cannot but make particularly strict demands on them. Radio broadcasters, film and drama actors are also propagators of language norms. Every day, countless viewers and listeners consciously or unconsciously learn from them. They have made great contributions to the promotion of Mandarin in the past. In the future, in the context of the planned promotion of Mandarin throughout the country, they will play a greater role, and naturally, they must also strengthen the standardization of their own language.

Secondly, some administrative measures should be taken. Every year, tens of millions of children enter elementary school, and training in speaking Mandarin should start from them. From elementary school to middle school to university, millions of teachers are the most direct teachers and propagators of Mandarin. The Ministry of Education has recently formulated a draft plan for promoting Mandarin in schools at all levels, which will soon become a formal plan. In addition to hoping that this plan can be earnestly implemented, we also hope that the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education will radically reform the teaching of Chinese language, so that students can receive systematic standardized education not only in phonetics, but also in grammar, rhetoric, and logic of written language, eliminating the phenomenon that many students still cannot speak Mandarin or write fluent writing after graduating from middle school or even university. Cultural administrative departments should also take some measures to strengthen the standardization of language in broadcasting, stage, film, and publications, and in particular, pay attention to using radio stations to teach Mandarin and strengthening the work of text editing in publishing institutions.

In order to promote the reform of Chinese characters and the standardization of the Chinese language, language scientists must quickly carry out a series of scientific research work. For example, many of the above-mentioned tasks are directly related to the use of language, and it is necessary to theoretically understand the characteristics and functions of language. We hope that language workers can apply the principles and methods of Marxist linguistics to the study of modern Chinese and do more popularization work on scientific theories. There is currently an urgent need in society for several good dictionaries and grammar books. These are consultants to help everyone use language correctly and master language norms. Language workers have a significant responsibility in this regard. In order to promote Mandarin, the work of dialect investigation is of particular importance, because only by mastering the corresponding relationship between dialects and Mandarin can Mandarin be effectively taught. In addition to this, there is much research work to be done. For example, the research on the vocabulary and grammar of colloquial language, the research on the vocabulary and grammar of Classical Chinese, the research on the language of translated works and foreign vocabulary and foreign grammar, and the research on language education are all directly related to the standardization of language.

In general, the work of reforming Chinese characters, promoting Mandarin, and realizing the standardization of the Chinese language is an important part of socialist construction and a relatively long-term task. Language workers, including those engaged in research and those engaged in teaching, have a particularly important responsibility for this work and must formulate practical plans in accordance with the policy of "overall planning, strengthening leadership" and implement them earnestly and cooperatively. At the same time, everyone who has an influence on the use of language and writing, especially intellectuals, also has a job to do and a responsibility to fulfill here. Only by combining the work of specialists with the work of the masses can this glorious task be accomplished at an early date.

    为促进汉字改革、推广普通话、实现汉语规范化而努力
    语言文字是人们交流思想的工具，同时也是社会斗争和社会发展的工具。中华人民共和国已经实现了历史上所没有过的高度的统一，并且正在掀起社会主义建设和社会主义改造的热潮，因此在占人口百分之九十以上的汉民族中间，大力推广普通话，促进文字改革和语言规范化，已经成为我国当前的迫切任务。中华人民共和国教育部和中国文字改革委员会召开了“全国文字改革会议”，从十月十五日起举行了九天的会议，从十月二十五日起，中国科学院又召开了“现代汉语规范问题学术会议”。这两次会议标志着中国文字改革和汉语规范化工作的开端。
    汉语是世界上最发达最重要的语言之一，汉语的书写符号汉字，是历史最长久、影响最深广的文字之一。谁都承认，汉字在我国人民的悠久的文化历史中有过伟大的贡献。几千年来，我国古代丰富的文献典籍，依靠汉字保存下来。今后，在我国进行社会主义建设和改造的时期中，汉字仍然将被广大的人民群众更广泛地使用。就在长远的将来，汉字也将继续存在并为许多人所研究。但是不能否认，汉字有严重缺点，因此给学习和使用带来了很大的困难。由于汉字的难认、难写、难记，使我国普通教育要在文字的教学方面耗费更多得多的时间。汉字在儿童教育、成人教育和扫除文盲工作中是一项沉重的负担。要是保持汉字的现状不加改革，就会严重地妨碍人民文化教育的普及和提高，对于国家工业化和国民经济的发展也是十分不利的。
    我们的党是向来重视文字改革工作的。毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”里早就指出：“文字必须在一定条件下加以改革，言语必须接近民众。”文字改革的方向和目标也已经是明确的。毛泽东同志在一九五一年指示：文字改革要走世界文字共同的拼音方向；但在实现拼音化以前，首先必须简化汉字，以利目前的应用，同时进行拼音化的各项研究工作和准备工作。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，语言工作者和文字改革工作者，遵照毛主席的指示，首先拟定了汉字简化方案草案，由中华人民共和国教育部和中国文字改革委员会于今年一月间发布，在全国各地展开群众讨论。同时，由新闻出版界共同选择了最通行的简化字一百四十一个，分成两批，在各主要报纸、杂志和图书上先行试用。讨论和试用的结果，证明简化汉字是为广大人民群众迫切需要的。中国文字改革委员会搜集和整理了群众所提出的意见，就原草案加以修正，提出“汉字简化方案修正草案”和“第一批异体字整理表草案”。全国文字改革会议经过认真讨论并提出修正意见之后，通过了以上两个草案，向中国文字改革委员会建议提请国务院审定公布实行。会议也同意了中国文字改革委员会所提出的“约定俗成、稳步前进”的方针，和分次分批逐步简化的办法。在这一个简化方案公布之后，中国文字改革委员会还要继续搜集群众意见，继续进行汉字的简化和整理工作。
    汉字简化工作的主要目的，是使汉字的笔划简化，字数减少，逐步做到汉字有定形、有定数，以便利于汉字的学习和使用。但是汉字简化，还不是文字的根本改革。要更进一步进行文字的拼音化，那就需要做一系列的调查、研究和其他各项准备工作。在目前最迫切的一项工作，就是推广汉民族共同语，同时力求汉语的进一步规范化。
    汉民族的口头语言，在目前的情况是这样的：一方面汉语的方言纷歧，地区的差别性很大，另一方面汉民族已经逐渐形成一种民族共同语。这种汉民族共同语，就是以北方话为基础方言、以北京语音为标准音的普通话。必须使这种普通话推广到全国各地，普遍使用，并使普通话在语音、语法、词汇各方面，有明确的规范，中国文字才能顺利地走上拼音化的道路。反过来说，如果没有规范明确的民族共同语，拼音文字就缺乏一个确定的基础；如果不积极推广民族共同语，拼音文字的推行就会遭遇很大的困难。
    推广普通话和汉语规范化的工作是同文字改革的工作不可分离的。但是推广普通话和实现汉语的规范化决不只是为着文字改革。无论为了加强汉民族的政治、经济、文化的统一，为了顺利地进行社会主义的建设，为了充分地发挥语言在社会生活中的交际作用，以至为了有效地发展民族间和国际间的联系、团结工作，都必须使汉民族共同语的规范明确，并且推广到全民族的范围。这是完全符合全民族的当前的迫切需要，也完全符合汉语历史发展的实际情况的。
    汉语发展的过程是非常曲折复杂的。我们曾经长期用“文言”作为统一的书面语，留下了丰富的文献。这种书面语原来必然是建立在口语基础上的，但是后来同口语的距离越来越远，学习起来非常困难，能够使用的人只占全民中的极少数，因此另外一种和口语直接相联系的书面语不得不起来同“文言”分庭抗礼。这就是后来所说的“白话”，也就是我们现在的民族共同语书面形式的主要源头。宋、元以来，用“白话”写的各种体裁的作品层出不穷，产生了许许多多的文学巨著。这些作品的语言虽然都或多或少地带有地方色彩，但是总起来说，它们的方言基础大多数是长时期在汉语中占优势地位的北方话。这些作品也流传到非北方话的区域里去，非北方话区域的作者也有用这种“白话”来创作的，这就为北方话的推广提供了优越的条件。至于口语方面，大约同这些“白话”文学作品的广泛流传同时，以北京话为代表的北方话也逐渐取得方言区之间的交际工具的地位，被称为“官话”，但是它的发展速度是落在白话文学的后面的。到本世纪初，随着民族民主革命运动的高涨，我们的民族共同语的长期形成过程开始加快，社会改革家提出了“言文一致”的主张。“五四”运动反对文言文，提倡白话文，动摇了文言的统治地位。“国语运动”和“注音字母”曾经以政令来推行，拉丁化新文字的提倡在推行北方话方面也起过一定作用。这接二连三的运动反映了汉民族共同语以书面语和口语的统一形式在加速形成的事实，“普通话”这名称逐渐代替了“官话”，也正是由这种事实决定的。
    解放以来，政治经济的迅速发展，推动着汉语的变化，也提高了语言的社会交际效能。口语方面，能说普通话的人日见其多，普通话在语音方面要求接近北京语音的愿望也越来越强。书面语已经基本上统一于“白话”，达到了原则上的“言文一致”。而且会写会读的人越来越多，书面语在口语的基础上随时在提高自己的精密丰富的程度，同时也就对口语的发展起着集中和提高的作用。
    我们的党是向来重视语言的纯洁性的。毛泽东同志在他的著作中屡次明白指示我们要怎样学好语言，他的著作本身就是使用语言的典范。解放以来，党和政府为语言的健康发展进行了不少工作。近几年来我们的语言学家和语文教师热烈地参加了对现代汉语的研究和讨论；国家机关和部队曾经普遍开展语法学习；广播工作者和戏剧工作者开始注意正音训练；新闻界和出版界也加强了文字编辑工作。这些实际行动都在不同程度上和在不同方面体现了党和政府的语言政策。也正是在这种有利的政治条件下，我们提出了汉语进一步规范化的任务。
    全国文字改革会议已经通过了大力推广普通话，即汉民族共同语的重要决议。“现代汉语规范问题学术会议”还要从学术方面来探讨汉语的进一步规范化。为了完成这一重要任务，我们要进行许多工作。
    首先要大力宣传推行普通话的重要性。要让人们正确地了解普通话和方言的关系。普通话是为全民服务的，方言是为一个地区的人民服务的。推行普通话并不意味着人为地消灭方言，只是逐步地缩小方言的使用范围，而这是符合社会进步的客观法则的。方言可以而且必然会同普通话在相当长的时期内并存，但是必须不断地扩大普通话的应用范围，要尽力提倡在公共场合说普通话，尽力提倡在书面语言中使用普通话，要纠正那种不承认普通话、不愿听普通话、甚至不许子弟说普通话的狭隘地方观念，纠正那种在出版物中特别是文学作品中滥用方言的现象。
    要促使每一个说话和写文章的人，特别是在语言使用上有示范作用的人，注意语言的纯洁和健康。语言的规范必须寄托在有形的东西上。这首先是一切作品，特别重要的是文学作品，因为语言的规范主要是通过作品传播开来的。作家们和翻译工作者们重视或不重视语言的规范，影响所及是难以估计的，我们不能不对他们提出特别严格的要求。电台广播员、电影和话剧演员，他们也都是语言规范的宣传家，每天有无数的观众和听众有意识地或无意识地在向他们学习。他们在普通话的推广上，过去已经有过很大的功劳，今后在全国范围内有计划地推广普通话的情况下，他们将起更大的作用，自然也就必须加强自己的语言的规范性。
    其次，要采取一些行政措施。每年有上千万的儿童进入小学，训练说普通话应该从他们开始。从小学到中学到大学，成百万的教师是普通话最直接的教学者和宣传家。教育部最近已经定出一个在各级学校推行普通话方案的草案，不久就会成为正式的方案。我们除了希望这个方案能够切实执行以外，还希望教育部和高等教育部根本改革汉语的教学，使学生不但在语音方面，而且在书面语言的语法、修辞、逻辑方面都能得到有系统的规范化的教育，消除目前很多学生在中学甚至大学毕业以后还不会说普通话、不会写通顺文字的现象。文化行政部门也应当采取一些措施加强广播、舞台、电影和出版物语言的规范化，特别是要注意利用广播电台教学普通话，和在出版机关加强文字编辑工作。
    为了促进汉字改革和汉语规范化，语言科学家必须迅速进行一系列的科学研究工作。比如说，上面所说的许多工作都同语言的使用直接有关，都需要从理论上了解语言的特点和作用。我们希望语言工作者能够把马克思主义的语言学的原理和方法应用到现代汉语研究方面来，多做些科学理论的普及工作。社会上目前迫切需要几部好的词典和语法书，这是帮助大家正确地使用语言，掌握语言规范的顾问，语言工作者在这方面的责任是重大的。为了推行普通话，方言调查的工作具有特别重要的意义，因为只有掌握了方言和普通话的对应关系，才便于有效地教学普通话。这以外还有许多研究工作要做。比如俗话的词汇和语法的研究，文言的词汇和语法的研究，翻译作品语言和外来词汇外来语法的研究，语言教育的研究，这些也都是直接和语言的规范化有关的。
    总起来说，改革汉字、推广普通话和实现汉语规范化的工作，是社会主义建设中重要的一环，是一个相当长期的工作。语言工作者，包括从事研究工作的和从事教学工作的，对于这一工作负有特别重大的责任，必须按照“全面规划、加强领导”的方针，订出切实的计划，认真地通力合作地加以执行。同时，每一个在使用语言文字方面有影响的人，尤其是知识分子，也都在这里边有一份工作可做，有一份责任要尽。只有把专门家的工作和群众的工作结合起来，才能早日完成这个光荣的任务。
