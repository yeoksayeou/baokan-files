Xinhua News Agency, Hyderabad, October 24th: Yesterday afternoon, October 23rd, citizens of Hyderabad, India, held a large-scale parade and mass rally to celebrate the victorious conclusion of the All-India Conference for Asian Solidarity.

    The procession started from Victory Playground. Citizens, women and youth, professors and students from all regions of Hyderabad, together with representatives attending the All-India Conference for Asian Solidarity, participated in the parade.

    The procession was led by white horses, elephants draped with blue flags bearing lotus symbols, and a band. The procession also carried many placards with slogans such as "Long live Asian and World Peace," "The Five Principles are the Road to Peace," "Restore China's Legitimate Status in the United Nations Organization," "Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs," and "Down with Colonialism." Many slogans also expressed opposition to aggressive military blocs and military bases and demanded that Portugal withdraw from Goa. The procession passed through the city's major streets, chanting slogans along the way.

    The parade ended at Nizam College, where a mass rally of 10,000 people was held. The meeting passed a resolution expressing support for the resolutions of the All-India Conference for Asian Solidarity.

    Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru said at the meeting that Asian countries had been bound by foreign powers for a long time, and now they must eliminate the evils of having been bound by foreign powers. Many of the problems these countries face are the same, and these problems can only be solved through mutual cooperation.

    Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru said that some countries in Asia and Africa are still groaning under the oppression of colonialism and are fighting for national independence and freedom. All Asian countries have a responsibility to rise up and support them. Therefore, the All-India Conference for Asian Solidarity demanded the immediate end of colonialism, as it is the biggest obstacle in the path of development for newly awakened Asian countries. She called on the people to redouble their efforts to strengthen the friendly ties between the people of Asian countries in order to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

    Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, President of the All-India Peace Council, said at the meeting that Asia, Africa, Europe, and the world all demand peace, because only peace can solve all the problems facing mankind. He said that it was precisely because of the people's voice that the new atmosphere of easing tension and hope brought about by the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference had emerged. He called for greater efforts to achieve Asian solidarity and peace, and thereby achieve world peace.

    Also speaking at the meeting were Syed Nausher Ali, Secretary-General of the Indian Committee for Asian Solidarity and Member of the Indian Parliament, Dr. Anup Singh, Member of the Indian Parliament, Onkar Nath Thakur, a famous Indian musician, Makhdoom Mohiuddin, Member of the Legislative Assembly of Hyderabad State and a famous Urdu poet, and Dr. Mulk Raj Anand, a famous Indian writer, who explained the important significance of the various resolutions passed by the All-India Conference for Asian Solidarity.

    The meeting ended with shouts of "Long Live World Peace and Asian Solidarity."

    新华社海得拉巴二十四日电　十月二十三日下午，印度海得拉巴市的市民们举行了大规模的游行和群众大会，庆祝全印争取亚洲团结会议的胜利闭幕。
    游行队伍从胜利运动场出发。来自海得拉巴各地区的市民、妇女和青年、教授和学生同出席全印争取亚洲团结会议的代表一起参加了游行。
    游行队伍以白马、披着有莲花标志的蓝色旗帜的大象以及乐队为前导。游行队伍还带着许多标语牌，上面写着“亚洲和世界和平万岁”，“五项原则是走向和平的道路”，“恢复中国在联合国组织中的合法地位”，“禁止原子弹和氢弹”和“打倒殖民主义”。还有许多标语表示反对侵略性的军事集团和军事基地，并且要求葡萄牙退出果阿。游行队伍通过了市内各大街道，沿途高呼口号。
    游行以尼查姆学院作为终点。在那里举行了一个有一万人参加的群众集会。会议通过了决议，表示拥护全印争取亚洲团结会议的各项决议。
    拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人在大会上说，亚洲国家曾经在一个很长的时期，受到了外国的束缚，现在，它们必须消除受过外国束缚的恶果。这些国家面对的问题许多是相同的，这些问题只有通过互相合作才能获得解决。
    拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人说，亚非两洲仍然有一些国家呻吟在殖民主义的压迫下，并且正在为民族的独立和自由而进行斗争。一切亚洲国家都有责任起来支援它们。因此，全印争取亚洲团结会议要求立即结束殖民主义，因为它是横在新近觉醒了的亚洲国家的发展道路上的最大障碍。她号召人民加倍努力以加强亚洲各国人民间的友好联系，以保障亚洲和世界的和平。
    全印和平理事会主席赛福丁·克其鲁博士在会上说，亚洲、非洲、欧洲和全世界各地都要求和平，因为只有和平才能解决人类所面临的一切问题。他说，正是由于人民的呼声才带来了经过日内瓦四大国政府首脑会议所产生的缓和紧张局势的新气氛和希望。他号召作出更大的努力，以达到亚洲团结与和平的目的并且进而实现世界和平。
