    Produce More, Better, and Cheaper Two-Wheel, Two-Share Plows
    To the Editor:
    We, the entire staff of the Two-Wheel, Two-Share Plow Workshop of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery General Factory, after studying the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of our country, deeply realize the glorious and arduous task of our agricultural machinery workers. The First Five-Year Plan stipulates that grain production should increase by 17.6 percent and cotton by 25.4 percent within five years. The use of new-style animal-powered farm tools, especially the two-wheel, two-share plow, is one of the effective measures to increase crop yields under the current conditions. This urgently requires us to produce a large number of high-quality and inexpensive two-wheel, two-share plows; the success or failure of our daily execution of the production plan is closely linked to the great First Five-Year Plan.
    Our workshop was established in February of this year to meet the task of mass-producing two-wheel, two-share plows. In the beginning, due to insufficient understanding of the significance of mass production of this product and its technical complexity, management work could not keep up, resulting in the phenomenon of being relaxed at first and then tense, and working overtime. By April, more than 1,300 products did not meet the national unified quality specifications and could not leave the factory. The Party organization and the factory's higher-level leadership immediately educated us and took a series of measures such as a major inspection of product quality. With the concerted efforts of everyone, our workshop began a new situation in June—product quality gradually improved, and costs decreased month by month; at the same time, we initially achieved: materials coming in on one side, finished products coming out on the other, and balanced production. The scrap rate of comprehensive castings for the two-wheel, two-share plows produced by our factory was 8.8 percent in June, 5.78 percent in July, and 4.3 percent in August. The cost of each two-wheel, two-share plow produced by our factory in August decreased by 0.94 percent compared to July. The balance rate of the "hourly production plan" implemented by the general assembly section has reached more than 90 percent in August. The processing section has greatly improved work efficiency by implementing the "shift plan." The quota for axle sleeves was 130 per worker, but the highest record in August reached 230. In the past, the general assembly section assembled 11 to 13 products per person every eight hours, but now the average has reached 20.
    Of course, our work is just beginning, and we must make a hundred times more effort, together with our brother factories across the country, to deliver more than 400,000 high-quality and inexpensive two-wheel, two-share plows to our farmer brothers.

    生产更多更好更便宜的双轮双铧犁编辑同志：
    我们北京农业机械总厂双轮双铧犁车间全体职工，学习了我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划以后，深深认识到我们农业机械工人的光荣而艰巨的任务。第一个五年计划规定五年内粮食产量要增长百分之一七·六，棉花增长百分之二五·四。而使用新式的畜力农具，特别是双轮双铧犁，是在目前的条件下提高农作物产量的有效措施之一。这就迫切需要我们生产大批质量好价钱便宜的双轮双铧犁；我们每天执行生产计划的好或坏，都密切地联系着伟大的第一个五年计划。
    我们这个车间，是今年二月间为了迎接大批生产双轮双铧犁的任务才成立的。开始时，由于对大量生产这种产品的意义和技术上的复杂性认识不足，管理工作跟不上，以致产生前松后紧和加班加点的现象。到四月份，甚至有一千三百多部产品不合乎国家统一标定的质量规格，不能出厂。党组织和工厂的上级领导方面立刻向我们进行了教育，采取了产品质量大检查等一系列措施。在大家一致的努力下，六月份我们车间就开始了一个新的局面——产品质量逐步提高，成本月月降低；同时，初步做到：这边进料，那边出活，均衡生产。我们厂的双轮双铧犁的综合铸件的报废率，六月份为百分之八点八，七月份为百分之五点七八，八月份为百分之四点三。八月份我们厂出产的每部双轮双铧犁的成本，比七月份降低了百分之零点九四。总装工段推行“小时生产计划”的均衡率八月份已经达到百分之九十以上。加工工段由于推行“轮翻计划”，大大地提高工作效率。轴套的定额每个工生产一百三十个，八月份最高的纪录已经达到二百三十个。过去总装工段每人每八个小时装配十一到十三部产品，现在平均达到二十部。
    当然，我们的工作还正在开始，我们要百倍努力，同全国的兄弟工厂一道，把四十多万部质优价廉的双轮双铧犁交到农民兄弟的手里。
