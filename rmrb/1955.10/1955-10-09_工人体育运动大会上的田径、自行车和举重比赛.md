    Athletics, Cycling, and Weightlifting Competitions at the Workers' Games
    Cheng Zhi
    The seven hundred and thirty-nine outstanding track and field, cycling, and weightlifting athletes of the First National Workers' Sports Games created excellent results in the fierce competition from October 2nd to 8th. Nine worker athletes broke four national records in track and field, two in women's cycling, and two in weightlifting. The workers' determination to overcome difficulties and strive for victory was warmly praised by thousands of spectators in the capital.
    On the opening day, new national records were set in the women's javelin final, the men's 800-meter preliminary, and the 5,000-meter final. This extraordinary beginning made many feel somewhat "unexpected." Wang Yi of the Education Trade Union, the creator of the national record for women's javelin throw, broke the national record of 34.12 meters with a throw of 34.44 meters at the Games. This not-so-well-known female throwing athlete was just a figure outside the top three at the National Track and Field and Gymnastics Games for students of secondary and higher education in thirteen cities in the summer of 1954, when her throwing score was only over 27 meters. Since receiving guidance and assistance from Soviet athletes at that meeting, her athletic potential has been more fully developed, making her the glorious creator of a new national record. Wang Yi's achievements on the sports field are an epitome of the road to success for thousands of athletes. China's track and field movement is advancing on the road of learning from the Soviet Union.
    The Games held a total of forty-four competition events, including men's and women's track and field, cycling, and men's weightlifting, each of which was tense and moving. The men's 5,000-meter final was particularly tense. Participating in the final of this event were Zhang Xiling of the Heavy Industry Trade Union, the holder of the national record for 10,000 meters, as well as the famous long-distance runners You Yunting of the Construction Trade Union and Fu Shenghai of the Railway Sports Association. After forty athletes rushed out of the starting line, everyone overtook each other in the first two laps. At the 1,000-meter mark, Fu Shenghai, Zhang Xiling, and You Yunting's advantages gradually became apparent. They not only had even steps and elastic legs, but also looked particularly relaxed in their running posture. The distance between the front and rear became greater and greater, but it was difficult to see who was better between Fu Shenghai, Zhang Xiling, and You Yunting. When approaching the 2,500-meter mark, the loudspeaker announced, "Chairman Mao is here!" The long-distance runners suddenly gained strength and ran swiftly. Immediately, a tense battle for the lead unfolded between Fu Shenghai, Zhang Xiling, and You Yunting. Fu Shenghai maintained his leading advantage, with Zhang Xiling and You Yunting closely following him, sometimes ahead, sometimes behind. The gun for the last lap sounded, and Fu Shenghai mustered his strength to sprint towards the finish line; the distance between Zhang Xiling and You Yunting became shorter and shorter, and the short bursts of cheers from the stands made the entire venue boil. As a result, Fu Shenghai won first place with a time of 15 minutes 15.6 seconds, shortening the national record by 5.4 seconds.
    In the field events, after Wang Yi's national record-breaking performance in the women's javelin, the most exciting event was the men's shot put. The national record for this event was set by Chen Baoqiu nineteen years ago. But on the afternoon of October 5th, Li Bingcheng of the Education Trade Union replaced this old record with a new score. Li Bingcheng's shot put score reached 13.34 meters, an increase of 8 centimeters over the old record. The achievements of the worker athletes vividly demonstrate the tremendous development of mass sports in our country.
    On the track and field, although many worker athletes are still new, they have shown great potential. Qi Zutan of the Education Trade Union achieved a long jump of 6.92 meters, only one centimeter short of the national record. And Li Zhi, a female athlete from the Railway Sports Association who has not been in the sports field for very long, surpassed the more experienced Sun Hongxia in the 400 meters, and her score was only 0.8 seconds short of the national record. In the past, bourgeois sports figures had a stale argument that women could not improve their athletic performance after childbirth. Today, Zhang Manhua, an athlete from the banking system, shattered this fallacy with concrete facts. Zhang Manhua is already the mother of two children, but she achieved good results in the preliminary, semi-final, and final of the 100 meters. She won third place in the women's 100-meter final at the Games, and her score was only 0.1 seconds behind the first and second place winners. These moving scenes all illustrate that the sports of workers and staff in our country are growing healthily.
    The women's cycling competition was inspiring. This Games stipulated only two competition events—1,500 meters and 3,000 meters. Both of these events broke the national record. The three athletes selected for the 3,000 meters all became creators of new national records. Wu Shuhua of the Light Industry Trade Union, a 19-year-old female worker, defeated twenty-six other strong opponents in the 1,500-meter cycling final, setting a new national record with a time of 2 minutes 59.5 seconds. The participants in the women's 3,000-meter final included Li Fengqin of the First Machinery Industry Trade Union, who broke the national record for the same event, and Li Guizhi, the creator of the national record for the women's 5,000-meter cycling event from Anshan, representing the Heavy Industry Trade Union. On October 6th, the same group of finalists included Li Fengqin, Li Guizhi, and Wu Shuhua. In order to create higher sports records for the country, these three equally matched opponents engaged in the fiercest struggle. They sped along the track, making it difficult for even those most familiar with cycling competitions to say who would win. In the end, they almost reached the finish line side by side. As a result, Li Fengqin, a "three-good" female worker from Dalian Shipyard, won first place with a time of 6 minutes 17.4 seconds; Li Guizhi won second place with a time of 6 minutes 17.5 seconds; Wu Shuhua took third place with a time of 6 minutes 17.7 seconds. When the announcer reported that they had all broken the national record of 6 minutes 18 seconds, the audience immediately responded with warm applause.
    Echoing the tense competition on the track and field was the good news from the weightlifting platform. Although the number of athletes participating in weightlifting at this Games was very small, and even among this small number of athletes, most of them had not been practicing international standard barbell weightlifting for very long, the weightlifting athletes still created two national records.
    The middleweight competition was intense. Liu Jintang, a porter representing highway transportation, had great arm strength. Before the competition, many people estimated that he was likely to break the national record for the same class. At the start of the competition, he performed well in both the press and snatch weightlifting styles. At this time, people also saw a young and strong competitor by his side, namely Li Zhengqing of the Light Industry Trade Union. Liu Jintang had a certain advantage in the first two weightlifting styles. The clean and jerk, which determined the key to victory, began. Li Zhengqing tried to lift 115 kilograms for the first time and passed smoothly. The barbell was increased to 125 kilograms. This weight exceeded the national middleweight clean and jerk record, and no other athletes lifted it. Li Zhengqing calmly lifted this weight, breaking the national record. On the last day of the weightlifting competition—October 5th, Cai Changhua of the light-heavyweight Light Industry Trade Union broke his retained national record of 300 kilograms, in all three styles, push, snatch, and clean and jerk, lifting a total of 310 kilograms.
    The Games are about to come to a victorious close. As Comrade He Long pointed out in his speech on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council at the opening ceremony, this Games "is not only the first review of the workers' sports movement since the founding of New China, but also a major event in the history of the Chinese working class." The harvest of the Games is very rich. Not only have the results of eight events broken national records, but more importantly, it has shown people the new face of the workers' sports movement in New China. Through this Games, the development of the sports movement of workers and staff in factories and mines across the country will undoubtedly be further promoted, which is a necessary task for us to complete the first Five-Year Plan. Let us work hard for socialist construction and for greater glory in international sports competitions!

    工人体育运动大会上的田径、自行车和举重比赛
    程执
    全国第一届工人体育运动大会的七百三十九名优秀的田径、自行车和举重选手，在从十月二日到八日的激烈竞赛中，创造了优良的成绩。九个工人运动员打破了四项田径、两项女子自行车和两项举重的全国最高纪录。工人运动员们克服困难和顽强地争取胜利的意志，受到了首都万千观众的热烈赞扬。
    开幕这天，女子标枪决赛，男子八百公尺预赛和五千公尺决赛就创造了全国新纪录。这个不平凡的开始，使许多人都感到有些“出人意外”。女子标枪掷远全国最高纪录创造者、教育工会的王毅，在会上以三十四公尺四十四公分打破了三十四公尺十二公分的全国最高纪录。这个还不很知名的女子投掷选手，在一九五四年夏天举行的全国十三城市中等以上学校学生田径、体操运动大会上，还只是个前三名以外的人物，当时她的投掷成绩不过二十七公尺多。她自从在那次会上接受了苏联运动员的指导和帮助，运动潜力得到了较充分的发挥，使她成为光荣的全国新纪录的创造者。王毅在运动场上取得的成就，是千百个运动员走向成功之路的一个缩影。我国田径运动，正在学习苏联的道路上前进。
    大会举行了男、女田径、自行车和男子举重共四十四个竞赛项目，每项比赛都很紧张、动人。男子五千公尺决赛尤其紧张。参加这个项目决赛的，有万公尺全国最高纪录的保持者重工业工会的张希苓，还有著名的长跑能手、建筑工会的酉云亭和火车头体协的傅生海。四十名运动员从起跑线冲出后，最初两圈大家互相超越着。到一千公尺处，傅生海、张希苓和酉云亭的优点就逐渐显现出来。他们不仅步点匀称，两腿富有弹力，而且在跑姿上显得特别轻松。前后的距离越拉越远，但傅生海、张希苓和酉云亭间却很难见高下。在快到二千五百公尺距离的时候，扩音器报告说“毛主席来了！”长跑运动员们忽然增长了力量，大家健步如飞地奔跑着。而傅生海、张希苓和酉云亭间，随即展开了紧张的争夺战。傅生海保持着领先的优势，张希苓和酉云亭或前或后地紧迫着他。最后一圈的枪声响了，傅生海鼓足力量向终点冲去；张希苓和酉云亭间的距离愈来愈短，看台上短促的欢呼声使整个会场沸腾起来。结果傅生海获得第一名，他的成绩是十五分十五秒六，比全国最高纪录缩短了五秒四。
    田赛场上继女子标枪王毅打破全国最高纪录后，最使人们兴奋的是男子铅球掷远。这个项目的全国最高纪录，是十九年前由陈宝球创造的。但在十月五日下午，教育工会的李秉诚用新的成绩代替了这个陈旧的纪录。李秉诚推铅球的成绩达到十三公尺三十四公分，比旧纪录增加了八公分。工人运动员的成就，无比生动地表明了我国群众性体育的巨大发展。
    田径场上，尽管许多工人运动员还是新手，但他们却表现了极大的潜力。教育工会的齐祖谭，跳远成绩达六公尺九十二公分，比全国最高纪录仅差一公分。而在运动场上出现时间还不太久的火车头体育协会女运动员李志，在四百公尺中超过了较有比赛经验的孙洪霞，她所创造的成绩比全国最高纪录仅差零点八秒。资产阶级的体育家们，过去有种陈腐的论调，说女子生育后就不能提高自己的运动成绩了。今天，银行系统的运动员章曼华，用具体的事实粉碎了这种谬说。章曼华已经是两个孩子的妈妈了，但她在百公尺预、复、决赛中都获得很好的成绩。她荣获大会女子百公尺决赛第三名，她的成绩仅比第一、二名差零点一秒。这些动人的景象，无一不说明我国职工体育正在健康地成长。
    女子自行车比赛是振奋人心的。这次大会规定只有两个竞赛项目——一千五百公尺和三千公尺。这两个项目都打破了全国最高纪录。三千公尺录取的三名运动员，都成了全国新纪录的创造者。轻工业工会的吴淑华是个年仅十九岁的女工，她在一千五百公尺自行车决赛中击败了其它二十六名强劲的对手，她以二分五十九秒五创造了新的全国最高纪录。女子自行车三千公尺决赛的参加者，有打破同一项目全国最高纪录的第一机械工会的李凤琴，还有来自钢都鞍山、代表重工业工会的女子自行车五千公尺全国最高纪录创造者李桂芝，十月六日，在同一组决赛的就是李凤琴、李桂芝和吴淑华三人。为了给国家创造更高的运动纪录，这三个势均力敌的对手各不相让地展开了最激烈的斗争。她们在跑道上驾车飞驰前进，使最熟悉自行车比赛的人，也难下断语究竟她们中谁会获胜。最后她们几乎是并肩到达终点。结果，大连造船厂的“三好”女工李凤琴获得第一名，成绩六分十七秒四；李桂芝获第二名，成绩六分十七秒五；吴淑华以六分十七秒七得第三名。当广播员报告她们全都打破六分十八秒的全国最高纪录时，全场观众马上向她们报以热烈的祝贺掌声。
    同田径场上的紧张竞赛相呼应的，是举重台上传来的捷报。虽然在这次大会上，参加举重的运动员数量很少，而且就在这少数运动员中，大部分人练习国际标准的杠铃举重的时间也还不长，但举重运动员们仍然创造了两项全国新纪录。
    中量级比赛的过程是剧烈的。代表公路运输的搬运工人刘金堂有着强大的臂力。比赛前，许多人都估计他很有可能刷新同级的全国最高纪录。比赛开始，他在推、抓两种举重方式中都表现得很好。也正是这个时候，人们也看到在他身边有个年青力强的竞争者，这就是轻工业工会的李正清。刘金堂的前两种举重占着一定的优势。决定胜负关键的挺举开始了，李正清第一次就试举一百一十五公斤，结果顺利地通过了。杠铃增加到一百二十五公斤。这个重量已超过全国中量级挺举的最高纪录，其它选手都没有举起来，李正清从容地举起了这个重量，他打破了全国最高纪录。举重比赛的最后一天——十月五日，次重级轻工业工会的蔡昌华打破了他保持的三百公斤的全国最高纪录，他在推、抓、挺三种举式中，总共举起了三百一十公斤。
    大会即将胜利闭幕了。正如大会开幕式上贺龙同志代表中共中央和国务院在讲话中指出的，这次大会“不仅是新中国成立以来工人体育运动的第一次检阅，也是中国工人阶级历史上一个重大事件。”大会的收获是十分丰盛的，不但有八个项目的成绩打破了全国最高纪录，更重要的是它给人们展示了新中国工人体育运动的新面貌。通过这次大会，无疑地将会进一步推进全国厂矿职工体育运动的发展，这正是我们完成第一个五年计划必要进行的一件工作。让我们为社会主义建设，为在国际体育比赛中争取更大的荣誉而努力吧！
