Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 23rd - "Freedom Newspaper," the organ of the Lao Free National United Front, reported: At zero hour on October 21st, all regular troops, local forces, militia, and guerrillas of the Lao Fighting Units on all fronts in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly simultaneously executed the ceasefire order issued by the General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Units. The newspaper also stated that in many areas, the Lao Fighting Units had moved to maintain a certain distance from the Lao Royal Army.

"Freedom Newspaper" pointed out: However, in certain places such as Muong Son (southwest of Sam Neua), the Lao Royal Army took advantage of the Lao Fighting Units' withdrawal to open fire and attack the Lao Fighting Units. They only retreated after the Lao Fighting Units retaliated in self-defense.

"Freedom Newspaper" further stated: On October 21st, the General Headquarters of the Lao Royal Army, on one hand, issued a ceasefire order, but on the other hand, secretly instructed its 7th Battalion to attack and occupy Muong Son and Na Ka. On the afternoon of October 21st, the Royal Government secretly ordered its 6th Battalion to occupy Na Gieng, Na Sa Mon, and Sa Liu (southeast of Muong Bun in Sam Neua province) within October 22nd.

"Freedom Newspaper" commented: "The aforementioned actions prove that although the Lao Fighting Units have been strictly implementing the ceasefire order, the Royal forces continue to take hostile actions, refusing to properly fulfill the recently concluded agreement on the cessation of hostilities. The Lao Royal Authorities have not yet abandoned their attempt to gradually occupy the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly."

"Freedom Newspaper" urged the Royal Government to immediately order its troops to cease all hostile actions against the Lao Fighting Units and to punish the saboteurs.

    寮国战斗部队全军严格执行停火命令
    老挝王国军队却伺机向寮国战斗部队进攻
    新华社河内二十三日电　寮国自由民族统一战线机关报“自由报”报道：十月二十一日零时，在桑怒和丰沙里两省各战线上的寮国战斗部队全部正规部队、地方部队、民兵和游击队同时执行了寮国战斗部队总司令部所发布的停火命令。这家报纸又说，在许多地区，寮国战斗部队已经转移，以便同老挝王国军队之间保持一定距离。
    “自由报”指出：但是，在孟桑（桑怒西南）等某些地方的老挝王国军队却利用寮国战斗部队转移的机会向寮国战斗部队方面开火和进攻。在寮国战斗部队因自卫而予以还击后，他们才退却。
    “自由报”又说：在十月二十一日，老挝王国军队总司令部一方面发出停火命令，但是另一方面却秘密指示它的第七营袭击和占领孟桑和那卡。在十月二十一日下午，王国政府秘密命令它的第六营在十月二十二日内占领那经、那萨蒙和沙柳（桑怒省芒奔东南）。
    “自由报”评论说：“上述这些行动证明：虽然寮国战斗部队一直在严格地执行停火命令，王国部队却继续在采取敌对行动，拒绝正确地履行新近缔结的关于停止敌对行动的协议。老挝王国当局至今还没有放弃它的逐步占领桑怒和丰沙里两省的企图。”
    “自由报”敦促王国政府方面立即命令它的部队停止对寮国战斗部队的一切敌对行动，并且惩处破坏分子。
