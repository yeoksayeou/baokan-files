Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 28th: The German News Agency published the report of Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, at the 25th Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee.

    In his report, Ulbricht explained the position of the German Democratic Republic on the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference and the issue of restoring German unification. He stated: The German Democratic Republic believes that the task of the four countries bearing significant responsibility for resolving the German question is to create the preconditions for restoring German unification. The obstacles to restoring German unification should be eliminated: the existence of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the remilitarization of West Germany. The prerequisite for restoring unification is to establish a European collective security system with the participation of both Germanies and to abolish the existing military blocs. We welcome the compromises reached in Geneva in this regard, which are beneficial to peace. As for the restoration of German unification itself, that can only be a matter for the German people themselves.

    Ulbricht pointed out that following the above path is the only way to restore German unification under conditions of peace and freedom. Under this premise, the German Democratic Republic advocates holding free elections throughout Germany, because only in this way will the elections be truly free, free from the pressure of militarism, and will not lead to the establishment of an imperialist Germany. The German Democratic Republic is prepared to seek mutual understanding with the Bonn government on this basis.

    Ulbricht said that it is necessary for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to hear the opinions of delegations from the German Democratic Republic and the West German government.

    In his report, Ulbricht accused the Bonn government of obstructing the peaceful resolution of the German question and demanded that the Bonn government change its policies. He emphasized that the German working class and all peace-loving forces of the German people must jointly struggle against the militarist forces still ruling West Germany in order to strive for German unification into a peaceful and democratic country.

    Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: According to TASS, Berlin, October 28th: Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer issued a statement outlining the Social Democratic Party's recommendations for the Geneva Conference.

    He said: "The issue of restoring (German) unification and the issue of guaranteeing security should be inextricably linked and must be resolved simultaneously." "The prerequisite for resolving these two issues is that the four powers must have a consistent opinion on the military status of a unified Germany."

    Ollenhauer believes that despite the various contradictions between East and West, there are certain commonalities between the two proposals. The Federal Government should state these commonalities in its corresponding proposals so that the Geneva Conference can discuss this issue.

    Ollenhauer suggested that the Soviet Union present its views on the military status of a unified Germany. At the same time, Western countries should reconsider West Germany's military obligations in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    Ollenhauer suggested that the obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany under the Paris Agreements and the obligations of the German Democratic Republic under the Warsaw Pact should be gradually replaced by agreements that serve as the basis for the conclusion of a European security treaty, and that a unified Germany should become an equal member of the European security treaty.

    乌布利希说明对恢复德国统一问题的立场
    西德社会民主党主席申述对日内瓦四外长会议的建议
    新华社柏林二十八日电　德意志通讯社发表了德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希在第二十五次党中央委员会全体会议上的报告。
    乌布利希在报告中说明了德意志民主共和国对四国外长会议和恢复德国统一问题的立场。他说：德意志民主共和国认为，对解决德国问题负有重大责任的四国的任务是为恢复德国的统一创造前提。应该扫除恢复德国统一的障碍：北大西洋公约组织的存在和西德的重新军国主义化。恢复统一的前提就是要建立有两个德国参加的欧洲集体安全体系，取消现有的军事集团。我们欢迎在日内瓦在这方面达成有益于和平的折衷协议。至于恢复德国统一本身，那只能是德国人民自己的事情。
    乌布利希指出，遵循上述途径，才能在和平和自由的条件下恢复德国的统一。在这种前提下，德意志民主共和国主张在全德国举行自由选举，因为这样选举才会真正自由，才会摆脱军国主义的压力，而不会导致建立一个帝国主义的德国。德意志民主共和国准备在这种基础上同波恩政府寻求互相谅解。
    乌布利希说，四国外长会议有必要听取德意志民主共和国和西德政府代表团的意见。
    乌布利希在报告中指责波恩政府阻挠德国问题的和平解决，要求波恩政府改变政策。他强调指出，德国工人阶级和德国人民一切爱好和平的力量要共同为反对还在统治着西德的军国主义势力而进行斗争，来争取德国统一成为和平、民主的国家。
    新华社二十九日讯　据塔斯社柏林二十八日讯：社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔发表谈话，申述社会民主党对日内瓦会议的建议。
    他说：“恢复（德国）统一的问题和保障安全的问题应该是不可分割地联系在一起的，必须同时加以解决”，“解决这两个问题的前提就是四国对统一的德国的军事状态要有一致的意见”。
    奥伦豪尔认为，尽管东西方之间还有各种矛盾，但是在两种主张之间是有某些相同之处的。联邦政府在相应的建议中应该申述这些相同之处，以便日内瓦会议讨论这一问题。
    奥伦豪尔建议苏联就统一的德国的军事状态提出自己的意见。同时西方国家应该重新考虑西德在北大西洋公约组织中的军事义务。
    奥伦豪尔建议说，德意志联邦共和国对巴黎协定的义务和德意志民主共和国对华沙条约的义务应该逐渐被作为签订欧洲安全条约的基础的协定所替代，而统一的德国应该成为欧洲安全条约的一个平等的成员国。
