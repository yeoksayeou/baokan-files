Some Experiences in Leading the Agricultural Cooperativization Movement
Jia Jun, Secretary of the CPC Changzhi Prefectural Committee, Shanxi

I.

	The development of agricultural producers' cooperatives in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi, over the past five years, fully demonstrates the correctness of the Party's policy on agricultural cooperativization and fully affirms the possibility of agricultural cooperativization. The development of the cooperativization movement in Changzhi Prefecture has gone through three stages: key pilot projects, comprehensive layout, and large-scale development. From the spring of 1951 to the spring of 1952, it was the key pilot project stage. Initially, the Prefectural Committee personally led the trial operation of ten cooperatives, followed by the county and district committees piloting one hundred and thirty-four cooperatives. From the autumn of 1952 to the spring of 1953, layout work was carried out in the entire prefecture in preparation for large-scale development, that is, "plum blossom" style distribution of points by township and village throughout the prefecture, with the number of cooperatives developing to nine hundred and eighty-four, basically achieving the goal of having cooperatives in every township. After the autumn of 1953, it entered a period of large-scale development. After two major developments, as of the end of August this year, the number of cooperatives in the entire prefecture had reached eight thousand three hundred and nineteen, with the number of cooperative member households reaching 63.2 percent of the total number of households, with an average of 50.9 households per cooperative. In four counties in the prefecture, the number of cooperative member households reached more than 70 percent of the total number of households, and in the remaining counties, the number of cooperative member households also reached more than half of the total number of households. Over the past five years, not only have cooperatives been developed in batches, but these cooperatives have also been consolidated in batches. None of the more than eight thousand cooperatives established from the key pilot projects to the two major developments have collapsed. Facts have proved that as long as we do our work well, cooperatives can not only be established in large numbers but also consolidated. The argument that "it is easy to establish cooperatives but difficult to consolidate them" cannot withstand refutation. The most important reason why cooperatives can be consolidated is that they can increase production. According to the results of a recent inspection, 98 percent of the cooperatives in Changzhi Prefecture can guarantee increased production. According to plan, after the third major development before the spring plowing next year, the number of cooperative member households will reach more than 80 percent of the total number of households, which basically completes the semi-socialist cooperativization. On this basis, we will actively and systematically transition these cooperatives to advanced cooperatives with a completely socialist nature. It is expected that by 1960, the entire prefecture will have completed the historical task of agricultural cooperativization.

II

	After studying Comrade Mao Zedong's report on the question of agricultural cooperativization and the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party on the question of agricultural cooperativization, and in connection with our experience in leading agricultural cooperativization over the past five years, we have the following insights:

	1.  Under the correct policy of the Party, it is very important to unify the will and action of all Party members. We deeply realize that the agricultural cooperativization movement is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle. In this struggle, the rich peasant ideology will inevitably be reflected in the Party, and therefore, there will inevitably be people in the Party who oppose the cooperativization movement. Therefore, continuously conducting education on the Party's cooperativization policy within the Party and continuously carrying out the struggle against the rich peasant ideology have become prerequisites for the smooth development of the cooperativization movement. Over the past five years, Changzhi Prefecture has conducted four large-scale struggles against the rich peasant ideology and against right-leaning thought within the Party. From the second half of 1950 to the end of 1951, in response to the slackening thought of "the revolution has reached its peak" that was growing among some Party members and cadres due to the rise of their family economic status, and based on the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, an ideological struggle against right-leaning was launched. A group of degenerated elements was purged from the Party. At the same time, education on the prospect that agriculture must take the road of mutual aid and cooperation to collectivization and modernization was conducted, and the slogan of combining organization and technological improvement put forward by the Provincial Committee was implemented to advance the mutual aid and cooperation movement a step further. In 1952, in response to the exploitative behavior that occurred among a small number of Party members and cadres, a struggle against the rich peasant ideology was launched, and class education on the "two roads" struggle was conducted. In 1953, the education on the Party's general line during the transition period was conducted in depth, and at the same time, based on Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions at the Third National Conference on Mutual Aid and Cooperation, the right-leaning thought of some cadres who dared not boldly develop cooperatives was criticized. In 1954, in order to further overcome the influence of the rich peasant ideology within the Party, Party rectification work was carried out in an all-round way. The Party members of the entire prefecture took a stand in the high tide of the cooperativization movement, and another group of degenerated elements and class dissidents was purged from the Party, further purifying and consolidating the Party organization. In total, during these four years, about 4 percent of the total number of Party members who were degenerated elements and class dissidents were purged from the Party, and at the same time, 28 percent of the total number of Party members who played an active leading role in the cooperativization movement were commended. Now it seems that without such four large-scale struggles against the rich peasant ideology and against right-leaning thought, it would not have been possible to strike down evil and promote righteousness, it would not have been possible to unify the will and action of the Party, it would not have been possible to implement the Party's policy of cooperativization, and it would not have been possible to smoothly carry out the cooperativization movement; but this does not mean that the cooperativization movement will be smooth sailing from now on. Facts have proved that today many cadres are growing arrogant, complacent, and losing vigilance on the issue of cooperativization, and some cadres have again revealed the right-leaning argument of "fear of rash advance" on the issue of transitioning some old cooperatives from lower to higher levels. From this, a lesson should be drawn: in the cooperativization movement, continuously conducting the struggle against the rich peasant ideology and against right-leaning thought is a regular matter that Party organizations must pay attention to.

	2.  In order to develop cooperatives and consolidate cooperatives, Party organizations must do a good job in cultivating cooperativization cadres. How to cultivate cadres? Comrade Mao Zedong instructed in "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization": "Cadres and peasants will transform themselves in their own struggle experience. Let them do it, learn lessons in the process, and increase their talents. In this way, a large number of outstanding people will emerge." Over the past few years, we have regarded the development and consolidation of cooperatives as the main source of cultivating cadres. From beginning to end, we have implemented the method of secretaries taking action, the whole Party running cooperatives, creating models, promoting the general, summarizing experiences, and educating cadres. Each member of the Prefectural Committee and County Committee has a cooperative that they regularly and directly contact, and almost every year they conduct one or two investigations and studies on the changes in class relations and the ideological trends of the masses, and often seize typical cases, use mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings, activist meetings, or through the mutual aid and cooperation network, organize large-scale observation, evaluation, and other methods to exchange experiences, so that a large number of cooperative cadres and activists among the peasants can understand the Party's policies on the cooperativization movement through these typical cases and experiences, and learn the working methods of the mass line that come from the masses and go to the masses. In this way, a large number of backbones for running cooperatives have grown up. Over the past five years, cadres of all rural branches and cadres above the district level in the entire prefecture have basically learned how to run cooperatives, and at the same time, 120,000 leading backbones above the level of production team leader of cooperatives and more than 200,000 labor models and activists have been cultivated from the peasants, which has formed a strong team for agricultural cooperativization, thereby solving the cadre problem in the cooperativization movement.

	3.  To run cooperatives both numerously and well, it is necessary, as Comrade Mao Zedong instructed, to do sufficient preparatory work before establishing cooperatives and to do regular consolidation work after establishing cooperatives. In 1951, after we successfully piloted ten cooperatives, we organized cadres from the entire prefecture, county, district, and township to study the successful experiences of these cooperatives. At the same time, on the basis of the mutual aid groups that had been generally established in the rural areas of the entire prefecture, a general plan for the development of cooperatives was made from top to bottom, which laid the ideological foundation for the gradual development of cooperatives in the future. After that, every spring, the development plan of cooperatives for that year will be formulated from bottom to top. Then, under the slogan of preparing year-round and preparing fully, from spring plowing to autumn harvest, according to the plan, through the mutual aid and cooperation network, implement joint groups, merging groups, selecting leading backbones, learning from the experience of old cooperatives, and setting up the framework of new cooperatives. This practice of making the establishment of cooperatives a year-round and regularized work is the specific content of doing sufficient preparatory work. The fact that "spontaneous cooperatives" have not appeared in the large-scale development of Changzhi Prefecture in the past two years is related to this. Now all the cooperatives in the entire prefecture are established on the basis of mutual aid groups. Then, with this sufficient preparatory work before the establishment of cooperatives, can we not pay attention to or pay less attention to the consolidation work after the establishment of cooperatives? Experience has proved that it is not possible. Because from the beginning of the establishment of a cooperative to its complete consolidation, it is necessary to carry out a series of extremely meticulous and complex ideological and organizational work in accordance with the Party's class line and various specific policies. This is a constructive and creative work, and it cannot be assumed that a large number of cooperatives can be consolidated on their own without consolidation after they are built. In the past two years, we have carried out three consolidation works on cooperatives every year in spring, summer and autumn. The content of each consolidation work varies according to the development of the work. Generally speaking, our consolidation work has focused on the following three points: (1) Promote democracy, review members, review leading backbones, improve leadership methods, and cultivate the leading core. (2) Check the organizational and economic systems of cooperatives, whether there are articles of association and the implementation of the articles of association, correct the implementation of policies, and improve operation and management. (3) Check the formulation and implementation of production plans; organize labor competitions to ensure the completion of the production increase plan. Facts have proved that as long as we grasp these three main links and consolidate the cooperatives two to three times a year, the cooperatives can definitely be consolidated. Now, more than 90 percent of the cooperatives in the entire region have formulated articles of association, generally have annual production plans, and more than 70 percent of the cooperatives have formulated long-term production plans for ten or fifteen years.

III

	Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us: "The leadership should not lag behind the mass movement." To achieve this, we must have a keen sense of new things, we must always pay attention to discovering new situations and new problems in the cooperativization movement, and promptly put forward methods to adapt to these new situations and solve these new problems. What are the new situations and new problems that have emerged after the large-scale development of cooperativization in Changzhi Prefecture?

	First, we have seen tremendous changes in rural class relations. According to the survey, the number of new rich peasants in the entire region has decreased from 8 per 1,000 of the total number of peasant households in 1951 to about 1 per 1,000. Land sales have basically stopped. In the four basically cooperativized counties, the rich peasant economy no longer exists. The number of poor peasants has decreased from 13.7 percent of the total number of peasant households in 1951 to 6.3 percent. Except for the well-to-do middle peasants who do not have much land but have sufficient labor, livestock, and farm tools and are unwilling to join the cooperatives, some have already joined the cooperatives and some are brewing to join. The main reason why they ask to join the cooperatives is that the production level of many cooperatives has exceeded their production level. According to statistics, 38 percent of the 1,276 old cooperatives have reached or exceeded the production level of well-to-do middle peasants. Now the general public opinion of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants in Changzhi Prefecture is: "Production depends on agricultural cooperatives, life depends on supply and marketing cooperatives, and money is found in credit cooperatives." The well-to-do middle peasants who want to join the cooperatives believe that: "Later is worse than sooner, sooner is worse than faster, and joining the cooperatives earlier is more glorious." The new rich peasants are in a situation of "no one wants to rent land, no one wants to be hired, speculative business is cut off, and lending and exploitation are afraid of being reported." This is a portrayal of the tremendous changes in rural class relations in Changzhi Prefecture. However, we have not become blindly optimistic because of this tremendous change. We realize that the rural class struggle has not become simpler or缓和[less intense] with this tremendous change, but is more acute and complex. Although the number of rich peasants has been greatly reduced, the resistance and sabotage of the rich peasants to the cooperativization movement is not proportional to the reduction in their number. Moreover, it can be seen from these sabotage incidents they have created that the rich peasant elements are not so isolated and helpless in the countryside. The problem is that the rich peasant economy has grown up on the basis of the small peasant economy. Therefore, as long as the small peasant economy still exists in the countryside, and there is still semi-private ownership in the cooperatives, that is to say, as long as the social foundation for the generation of the rich peasant economy still exists in the countryside, then the influence of the rich peasant ideology will often form resistance or even sabotage to the socialist transformation. Moreover, even after the rich peasant economy is eliminated, the remaining influence of this capitalist ideology will exist in people's consciousness for a long time. At that time, we will still have to fight against the remaining influence of capitalist ideology in people's consciousness. Therefore, we must never think that most peasant households in the countryside have cooperativized, the rich peasant economy has been greatly weakened or does not exist, so the struggle of "two roads" will also be greatly weakened or does not exist. But now many of our comrades think so. Obviously, this is not in line with the laws of class struggle. To completely eliminate rural capitalism, we can only completely change the individual ownership of peasants into collective ownership. Therefore, our task is not only to organize all peasants into semi-socialist cooperatives, but also to take appropriate steps to promote the transition of lower-level cooperatives to higher-level cooperatives. Completing this transition still requires complex struggles. This is mainly reflected in three issues: the accumulation of public funds in the cooperatives, the gradual increase in labor remuneration, and the gradual reduction in land remuneration, and the collectivization of livestock and farm tools. There is a contradiction between the demand for transition and the unwillingness to transition, which is essentially the contradiction between poor peasants and middle peasants. In order to solve this contradiction, in practical work, it is necessary to constantly increase the productive forces of the cooperatives and create conditions for the transition economically. At the same time, we must strengthen the Party's political and ideological work, constantly overcome the selfish psychology of small producers, and ideologically transform the peasants, especially pay attention to improving the socialist awareness of the middle peasants. We still lack experience in this new and complex task and need to learn and create experience in this area.

	Second, we have seen that changes in production relations have promoted the improvement of productive forces. Compared with 1954 and 1952, the total grain output in the entire region increased by 17.8 percent, the number of draft cattle increased by 7.4 percent, the number of pigs increased by 11.1 percent, and the number of sheep increased by 8.8 percent. The superiority of cooperativization has created unlimited possibilities for tapping the potential of agricultural production. Taking Pingshun County as an example, on the basis of the county's cooperativization and through comprehensive planning and the development of a diversified economy, it is estimated that after fifteen years, the average total income of grain per person per year can reach 3,400 jin, which is more than four times higher than in 1954. However, how to give full play to the superiority of cooperatives and how to tap the potential power of agricultural production are not completely solved problems for us. Now many of our comrades believe that "the production of cooperatives has reached its peak" and "cooperatives only have three years of superiority." This complacent and conservative tendency in production mainly reflects the thought of middle peasants. If this thought is not constantly and thoroughly criticized, agricultural productive forces cannot be continuously improved, and cooperatives cannot be finally consolidated. According to existing experience, the most effective way to overcome this conservative thought is to strengthen comprehensive planning of production; give full play to the technical guidance of state-owned agricultural experimental farms and technology promotion stations, and improve agricultural production technology in a planned way; and organize a wide range of labor competitions among a broad mass of activists and youth shock brigades. We can and must make the production level of existing cooperatives catch up with that of well-to-do middle peasants in three or four years. The current key lies in earnestly learning the knowledge of the struggle for production, starting from ourselves and even the Party organizations at all levels in the entire region, being good at combining science and technology with the production experience of the masses. At the same time, we must be good at organizing comprehensive economic work with production as the center.

	Third, we have seen that the material and cultural life of peasants has also greatly improved due to the large-scale development of cooperatives. Compared with 1954 and 1949, the purchasing power of rural areas in the entire region has increased by 60 percent. Peasants in Pingshun County who participated in the cooperatives described their lives as follows: In the past, it was "half a year of bran and vegetables, half a year of grain," now it is "eating enough every meal, surplus grain every year, and being able to eat meat and noodles during the New Year and festivals." In the past, it was "less clothes to wear, less bedding to spread," now it is "wearing city-made clothes and covering flowered quilts at night." As for the improvement of the cultural life of the masses, it can be illustrated by mentioning a few things. Now every township has a people's school, and 230,000 cooperative members participate in people's school studies. Many cooperative accountants and work recorders are graduates of people's schools. Young cooperative members are particularly enthusiastic about learning culture. The leadership has not grasped the work of eliminating illiteracy tightly, but they themselves have grasped it very tightly. After three years of spare-time study, more than 100 production team leaders of the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm can now take simple notes. In addition, the sanitary conditions in rural areas have also greatly improved, and diseases have begun to decrease. In particular, labor is glorious, exploitation is shameful, taking the cooperative as one's home, and loving socialism have become the dominant social atmosphere. All these new situations require us to take various measures to meet the needs of peasants' material and cultural life while leading the development of cooperatives' production. We must also take both aspects into account when formulating a comprehensive plan for agricultural cooperativization.

	However, in the current cooperativization movement in Changzhi Prefecture, we must oppose two kinds of deviations. One is blind optimism, extravagance and waste, and increasing non-productive expenditures; the other is not caring about the lives and welfare of poor cooperative members and general cooperative members. Therefore, we must on the one hand emphasize the principle of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives and gradually promote the cost accounting system; at the same time, on the other hand, we must develop the sideline production of cooperatives and cooperative members in accordance with local conditions, and give cooperative members time to engage in sideline production without affecting the collective production of the cooperatives, in order to increase cooperative members' income and solve the difficulty of lacking pocket money. We must pay attention to the accumulation of public welfare funds and gradually help widowed, orphaned, lonely, disabled, and sick cooperative members to overcome difficulties in life. At the same time, we must strengthen the leadership of the work of eliminating illiteracy and strive to complete the work of eliminating illiteracy among young cooperative members in three to five years. Universally promote the experience of cooperatives running youth technical night schools and cultivate a large number of young technical talents.

	In order to adapt to the new situation of the current cooperativization movement, we must further strengthen Party building and improve the combat effectiveness of Party grassroots organizations. This requires us to gradually establish Party general branch committees by township and Party branch subcommittees by cooperative, in order to further strengthen the Party's leadership over the cooperativization movement and improve the combat effectiveness of Party grassroots organizations.

	We will resolutely follow the "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on agricultural cooperativization, work hard, study hard, guard against arrogance and rashness, and strive with full confidence to complete the socialist transformation of agriculture and the cause of socialist construction.

    领导农业合作化运动的几点体会
    中共山西长治地委书记　贾俊
    一　　　　
    五年来，山西长治专区农业生产合作社的发展，充分证明了党的农业合作化方针的正确性，也完全肯定了农业合作化的可能性。长治专区的合作化运动的发展是经过重点试办、全面布局和大发展三个时期的。一九五一年春到一九五二年春，为重点试办时期。开始由地委亲自领导试办了十个社，接着又由各个县委和区委试办了一百三十四个社。一九五二年秋到一九五三年春作了全区准备大发展的布局工作，即在整个专区按乡按村作了“梅花式”的布点，合作社发展到九百八十四个，基本上达到了乡乡有社。一九五三年秋以后为大发展时期，经过两次大发展以后，截至本年八月底，全专区合作社已达八千三百一十九个，入社农户达到农户总数的百分之六十三点二，每社平均五十点九户。全专区入社农户达到农户总数百分之七十以上者四个县，其余各县入社农户也达到农户总数的一半以上。五年来，不仅一批一批地发展了合作社，而且把这些合作社也都一批一批地巩固下来了，从重点试办到两次大发展建立的八千多个合作社中，没有一个垮台的。事实证明，只要我们工作作得好，合作社不仅可以大批建立，而且能够巩固下来。所谓“建社容易巩固难”的论调是经不起反驳的。合作社所以能够巩固，最重要的是由于它能够增产。从最近检查的结果来看，长治专区百分之九十八的社都可以保证增产。按照计划，经过明年春耕前的第三次大发展，入社农户可达农户总数的百分之八十以上，即基本上完成了半社会主义性质的合作化。在这一基础上，我们将积极地有步骤地使这些合作社过渡到完全社会主义性质的高级合作社。预计到一九六○年，全专区即可全部完成农业合作化的历史任务。
    二
    学习了毛泽东同志关于农业合作化问题的报告和党的七届六中全会（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议，联系五年来我们领导农业合作化的经历，我们有以下几点体会：
    一、在党的正确方针之下，统一全体党员的意志和行动是十分重要的。我们深深体会到，农业合作化运动是一场极其尖锐和复杂的阶级斗争。在这一斗争中，富农思想必然会反映到党内来，因而党内就必然会出现反对合作化运动的人。因此，在党内不断进行党的合作化方针的教育和不断进行反对富农思想的斗争，就成为合作化运动顺利发展的先决条件。五年以来，长治专区在党内进行过四次规模巨大的反对富农思想和反对右倾思想的斗争。一九五○年下半年到一九五一年底针对当时一部分党员和干部由于家庭经济地位上升而滋长着的“革命到了顶”的退坡思想，根据党的七届二中全会的决议，开展了反右倾的思想斗争。从党内清除了一批蜕化变质分子。同时进行了农业必须经过互助合作的道路走向集体化、现代化的前途教育，并贯彻执行了省委提出的组织起来和提高技术相结合的口号，把互助合作运动向前推进了一步。一九五二年针对少数党员和干部中所发生的剥削行为，又开展了反富农思想的斗争，进行了“两条道路”斗争的阶级教育。一九五三年深入进行了党在过渡时期总路线的教育，同时根据毛泽东同志在全国第三次互助合作会议上的指示，批判了部分干部不敢大胆发展合作社的右倾思想。一九五四年为了进一步克服富农思想在党内的影响，全面地进行了整党工作，全专区的党员在合作化运动的高潮中站了一次队，又从党内清除了一批蜕化变质分子和阶级异己分子，进一步纯洁和巩固了党的组织。总计在这四年之中，从党内清除了占党员总数的百分之四左右的蜕化变质分子和阶级异己分子，同时也表扬了占党员总数百分之二十八的在合作化运动中起了积极带头作用的好党员。现在看来，如果没有这样四次大规模的反对富农思想，反对右倾思想的斗争，就不能打击邪气，发扬正气，就不能统一党的意志和行动，就不能贯彻执行党的合作化的方针，也就不能顺利开展合作化运动；但这还不能说，从此以后合作化运动就会一帆风顺。事实证明，今天不少干部在合作化问题上正在滋长着骄傲自满和丧失警惕性的麻痹思想，还有一些干部在部分老社由低级向高级过渡的问题上又流露出了“怕冒进”的右倾论调。由此，就该得出一条教训，在合作化运动中，不断进行反对富农思想和反对右倾思想的斗争，是党组织的经常必须注意的事情。
    二、为了发展合作社和巩固合作社，党组织就要做好培养合作化干部的工作。怎样培养干部呢？毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”中指示：“干部和农民在自己的斗争经验中将改造他们自己。要让他们做，在做的中间得到教训，增长才干。这样，大批的优秀人物就会产生。”几年来，我们把发展和巩固合作社当作培养干部的主要源泉。自始至终实行了书记动手，全党办社，创造典型，推动一般，总结经验，教育干部的办法。地委、县委的每个委员都有经常直接联系的合作社，而且差不多每年都要进行一两次对阶级关系的变化和群众思想动态的调查研究，并且经常抓住典型事例，运用互助合作代表会、积极分子会，或通过互助合作网，组织大规模的观摩、评比等方法来交流经验，这就使大批合作社的干部和农民中的积极分子，能够通过这些典型事例和经验领会党对合作化运动的方针和政策，学到从群众中来到群众中去的群众路线的工作方法。这样，大批的办合作社的骨干就生长起来了。五年来，全专区所有的农村支部的干部和区级以上的干部基本上都学会了办社，同时从农民中培养了合作社生产队长以上的领导骨干十二万人，劳动模范、积极分子二十余万人，这就形成了一支农业合作化的强大队伍，从而也就解决了合作化运动中的干部问题。
    三、要把合作社办得又多又好，就必须像毛泽东同志指示的那样，在建社前要做好充分的准备工作，建社后又要做好经常的整顿工作。一九五一年，我们在十个社试办成功后，即组织全专区县、区、乡干部学习这些社的成功经验。同时在全专区农村已经普遍建立起互助组的基础上自上而下地作了发展合作社的大体规划，这为以后逐步发展合作社打下了思想基础。此后，每年春季都要自下而上地制定当年合作社的发展计划。然后在常年准备、充分准备的口号下，从春耕到秋收按照计划，通过互助合作网，实行联组、并组，选拔领导骨干，学习老社经验，搭起新社架子。这种把建社工作常年化、经常化的作法，就是做好充分准备工作的具体内容。长治专区内在最近两年的大发展中没有出现过“自发社”是与此有关的。现在全专区的合作社都是在互助组的基础上建立起来的。那末有了这种建社前的充分的准备工作，是否建社以后就可以不注意或少注意整社工作呢？经验证明不可以。因为合作社从开始建成到完全巩固，必须按照党的阶级路线和各项具体政策进行一系列的极细致极复杂的思想工作和组织工作，这是一种建设性和创造性的工作，不能设想大批合作社建成以后不作整顿就可以自行巩固。最近两年，我们每年都是按春、夏、秋三季进行三次整社工作。每次整社工作的内容都按工作发展情况而有所不同。总的说来，我们的每次整社工作都抓紧了以下三点：（一）发扬民主，审查社员，审查领导骨干，改善领导方法，培养领导核心。（二）检查合作社的组织制度和经济制度，有无社章和对社章的执行情况，端正政策的执行，改善经营管理。（三）检查生产计划的制定和执行情况；组织劳动竞赛，保证增产计划的完成。事实证明，只要抓住这样三个主要环节，每年对合作社作两次到三次的整顿，合作社是一定可以巩固的。现在，全区有百分之九十以上的社都制定了社章，普遍都有年度生产计划，并有百分之七十以上的社制定了十年或十五年的长期生产规划。
    三
    毛泽东同志指示我们：“领导不应当落在群众运动的后头。”为要做到这一点，我们就必须具有对新鲜事物的锐敏感觉，就必须时刻注意发现合作化运动中的新情况、新问题，并及时提出适应这些新情况，解决这些新问题的办法。长治专区合作化大发展后出现的新情况和新问题是什么呢？
    首先，我们看到了农村阶级关系发生了巨大的变化。据调查，现在全区新富农已由一九五一年占农户总数的千分之八减少到千分之一左右。土地买卖已基本上停止了。四个基本上合作化的县，富农经济已经不存在了。贫农由一九五一年占农户总数的百分之十三点七减少到百分之六点三。富裕中农除土地不多、劳力、牲口和农具齐全的不愿入社外，有的已入社，有的正在酝酿入社。他们之所以要求入社，主要是由于不少合作社的生产水平已超过他们的生产水平。据统计，一千二百七十六个老社的生产水平，已达到或超过富裕中农生产水平的即占百分之三十八。现在长治专区的贫农和下中农的普遍舆论是：“生产得亏农业社，生活全靠供销社，花钱就找信用社。”要求入社的富裕中农认为：“迟不如早，早不如快，早入社早光荣。”而新富农则处于“出租土地无人要，想找雇工没人当，投机买卖断门路，放账剥削怕告状”的境地。这就是目前长治专区农村阶级关系发生了巨大变化的写照。但是，我们并没有因为这种巨大变化而盲目乐观起来，我们认识到农村的阶级斗争，不是随着这种巨大变化而简单了，缓和了，而是更加尖锐和复杂了。富农的数量虽然大大减少，但富农对合作化运动的抵抗和破坏并不同他们的数量减少成正比例。而且，从他们所制造的这些破坏事件中可以看出，富农分子在农村并不是那样孤立无援的。问题在于富农经济是在小农经济的基础上滋长起来的，所以，只要农村中还有小农经济的存在，合作社内部还有半私有制的存在，就是说，只要农村中还有产生富农经济的社会基础存在，那末，富农思想的影响就会经常形成对社会主义改造的抵抗甚至破坏。况且这种资本主义的思想残余影响，即使在富农经济消灭以后，还会在人们的意识中长期存在，到那时，我们还要同人们意识中资本主义思想的残余影响进行斗争。因此，我们决不应当这样想，农村中多数农户合作化了，富农经济大大削弱了，或者不存在了，因而“两条道路”的斗争也就跟着大大削弱或者不存在了。但现在我们有不少同志正好是这样想的。显然，这是不合乎阶级斗争的规律的。要彻底消灭农村资本主义，只有把农民的个人所有制完全改变为集体所有制。所以，我们的任务，不仅要把全体农民组织到半社会主义的合作社中来，而且要采取适当的步骤促使低级社过渡到高级社。完成这种过渡仍然要经过复杂的斗争。这主要表现在社内公积金的积累、劳动报酬的逐步提高和土地报酬的逐步降低、牲畜农具的公有化等三个问题上。在这里存在着要求过渡和不愿意过渡的矛盾，实质上就是贫农和中农之间的矛盾。为要解决这个矛盾，在实际工作中就必须不断地增长合作社的生产力，从经济上创设过渡的条件。同时，必须加强党的政治思想工作，不断地克服小生产者个人自私心理，从思想上改造农民，尤其要注意提高中农的社会主义觉悟。对于这一新的复杂的任务，我们还缺乏经验，需要学习和创造这一方面的经验。
    第二，我们看到了生产关系的变化，促进了生产力的提高。以一九五四年同一九五二年相比，全区的粮食总产量增长了百分之十七点八，耕畜增加了百分之七点四，猪增加了百分之十一点一，羊增加了百分之八点八。合作化的优越性，给挖掘农业生产潜力创造了无限的可能性。以平顺县为例，在全县合作化的基础上，经过全面规划，发展多种经济，十五年后，每人每年粮食平均总收入预计可达三千四百斤，比一九五四年还要提高四倍多。但是，如何发挥合作社的优越性，如何发掘农业生产的潜在力量，对于我们来说并不是完全解决了的问题。现在我们已有不少同志认为“合作社的生产已经到顶”，“合作社只有三年的优越性”，这种生产上的自满保守倾向，主要是反映了中农思想。如果不经常地彻底地批判这种思想，农业生产力就不可能不断地提高，合作社也就不可能最后地巩固。根据已有经验证明，要克服这种保守思想，最有效的办法是加强生产的全面规划；发挥国营农业试验场、技术推广站的技术指导作用，有计划地改进农业生产技术；组织广大积极分子和青年突击队广泛地开展劳动竞赛运动。我们可能而且必需在三、四年内使现有合作社的生产水平赶过富裕中农。目前的关键在于，从我们自己起以至全专区各级党组织，认真学习生产斗争的知识，善于把科学技术和群众的生产经验结合起来。同时，善于以生产为中心组织全面的经济工作。
    第三，我们看到了由于合作社的大发展，农民物质、文化生活也大大提高了。以一九五四年和一九四九年相比，全专区的农村购买力即提高了百分之六十。平顺县参加了合作社的农民这样描写自己的生活：过去是“半年糠菜半年粮”，现在是“顿顿吃饱饭，年年有余粮，过年过节还能吃到肉和面”。过去是“少穿没戴，少铺没盖”，现在是“身上穿的市布衣，黑夜盖的花花被”。至于群众文化生活的提高，只要举出几件事就可以说明了。现在每个乡都有民校，合作社社员参加民校学习的有二十三万人，不少合作社的会计和记工员都是民校的毕业生。青年社员学习文化的情绪特别高涨，扫除文盲工作，领导上抓得不紧，可是他们自己却抓得非常紧。中苏友好集体农庄一百多个生产队长经过三年的业余学习，现在都已能记简单的笔记了。此外，农村中的卫生状况也大有改善，疾病也开始减少。特别是劳动光荣，剥削可耻，以社为家，热爱社会主义已成为主导的社会风气。所有这些新的情况，要求我们在领导合作社发展生产的同时，还必须采取各种措施满足农民物质生活和文化生活的需要。我们在制定农业合作化的全面规划时，也必需兼顾这两个方面。
    但是在目前长治专区的合作化运动中必须反对这样两种偏向。一种是盲目乐观、铺张浪费、增大非生产性的支出；另一种是不关心贫苦社员和一般社员的生活福利。因此，我们必须一方面强调勤俭办社的方针，逐步推行成本核算制；同时另一方面要因地制宜地发展合作社的和社员的副业生产，在不影响社的集体生产的条件下，应给社员个人以从事副业生产的时间，以便增加社员收入，解决缺少零花钱的困难。必须注意公益金的积累，逐步地帮助鳏寡孤独老残病弱的社员克服生活上的困难。同时，必须加强对扫除文盲工作的领导，争取在三、五年内，完成对合作社的青年社员的扫除文盲工作。普遍推广合作社办青年技术夜校的经验，大量培养青年技术人材。
    为了适应目前合作化运动的新局面，必须进一步加强党的建设，提高党的基层组织的战斗力。这就要求我们要逐步地按乡建立党的总支委员会，按合作社建立党的分支部，以便进一步加强党对合作化运动的领导，提高党的基层组织的战斗力。
    我们将坚决遵循党的七届六中全会（扩大）“关于农业合作化问题的决议”和毛泽东同志关于农业合作化的指示，努力工作，努力学习，戒骄戒躁，满怀信心地为完成农业的社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业而奋斗。
