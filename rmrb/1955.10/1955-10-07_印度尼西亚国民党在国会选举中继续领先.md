The Indonesian "People's Daily" said on the 6th that people from all walks of life in Indonesia hope that the three major parties leading in Java—the Indonesian Nationalist Party, the Indonesian Nahdlatul Ulama, and the Indonesian Communist Party—will establish a coalition government.

The "People's Daily" said that the chairman of the Indonesian Nahdlatul Ulama, Dahlan, expressed the hope that a stable cabinet that achieves national stability will be formed soon. Another Indonesian Nahdlatul Ulama leader, former Deputy Prime Minister Arifin, also told the press that the Indonesian Nahdlatul Ulama has had its own political line since it separated from the Masyumi Party. Arifin said that the Indonesian Nahdlatul Ulama advocates cooperation between Muslims and nationalists. Regarding the issue of cooperation between the Nationalist Party, the Indonesian Nahdlatul Ulama, and the Indonesian Communist Party, he said that the attitude of the Indonesian Nahdlatul Ulama can be seen from the political line it adopted during the Ali-Arifin cabinet.

The "People's Daily" reported that the General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, Aidit, said that if the future cabinet is one supported by Muslims, nationalists, and communists, it would be an ideal cabinet.
