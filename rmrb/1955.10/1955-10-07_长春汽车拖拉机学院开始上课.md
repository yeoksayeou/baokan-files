    Changchun Automotive Tractor Institute Begins Classes
    The Changchun Automotive Tractor Institute began classes before National Day.
    The Changchun Automotive Tractor Institute was established to support the development of China's automotive and tractor manufacturing industry, and it will train specialized personnel for the country to manufacture automobiles, tractors, and agricultural machinery. There are currently more than 1,470 students. During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the institute will supply the industrial sector with its first batch of nearly 600 graduates.
    To meet the needs of teaching and enable students to consolidate their theoretical and technical knowledge of automobile and tractor manufacturing, the Changchun Automotive Tractor Institute has established sixteen laboratories and a practice factory. These laboratories and the practice factory are equipped with various experimental equipment and precision instruments related to automobile and tractor manufacturing. The engine laboratory has new air-cooled engines and hydraulic dynamometers and electric dynamometers for measuring engine horsepower. The precision metrology laboratory has precision instruments such as universal tool microscopes that can identify one-thousandth of a millimeter.
    In the process of construction, the Changchun Automotive Tractor Institute has received support from various universities and factories. Relevant units under the First Ministry of Machine Building have allocated dozens of machines for teaching purposes to the school. Tsinghua University, Harbin Institute of Technology, Northeastern University of Technology, and more than a dozen other universities and colleges have provided the Changchun Automotive Tractor Institute with teaching syllabuses for relevant courses to be used as references when the institute revises its teaching syllabuses and teaching plans. Factories in Shenyang, Tianjin, Lüda, Benxi, and other places have also collected various ores, pig iron products, fuels, bakelite, rubber, leather, asbestos, refractory materials, and many specimens and various models of iron-smelting plants and aluminum-smelting furnaces needed for manufacturing automobiles and tractors for the Changchun Automotive Tractor Institute.

    长春汽车拖拉机学院开始上课
    长春汽车拖拉机学院已在国庆节前夕开始上课。
    长春汽车拖拉机学院是配合我国汽车和拖拉机制造工业的发展而建立的，它将为国家培养制造汽车、拖拉机和农业机器的专门人材。现有学生一千四百七十多人。在第一个五年计划时期内，学院将为产业部门输送第一批近六百名毕业生。
    为了适应教学需要，使学生能巩固地掌握制造汽车、拖拉机的理论和技术知识，长春汽车拖拉机学院已建立十六个实验室和一个实习工厂，这些实验室和实习工厂装配着各种有关制造汽车、拖拉机的实验设备和精密仪器。发动机实验室有新式的空气冷却的发动机和测量发动机马力的水力测功器和电力测功器。精密量具实验室里，有能认别千分之一毫米的万能工具显微镜等精密仪器。
    长春汽车拖拉机学院在建设过程中，得到各高等学校和工厂的支援，第一机械工业部所属有关单位为学校调拨了供教学用的几十台机器。清华大学、哈尔滨工业大学、东北工学院等十多个院校都为长春汽车拖拉机学院提供了有关课程的教学大纲，供学院修订教学大纲和教学计划时参考。沈阳、天津、旅大、本溪等地的工厂还为长春汽车拖拉机学院收集了制造汽车、拖拉机需要的各种矿石、生铁成品、燃料、电木、橡胶、皮革、石棉、耐火材料等许多标本和炼铁厂、炼铝炉等各种模型。
