    More Than 1,500 Units in Shanghai
    Save 130,000 Tons of Coal in One Year
    Since last September, more than 1,500 factories, government offices, organizations, and schools in Shanghai have successively launched a campaign to save coal, and have now saved more than 130,000 tons of coal for the country, worth more than 4 million yuan.

    The current coal consumption of more than 1,000 factories that started saving coal earlier has decreased by an average of more than 15% compared to before last September. Last year, the state stipulated that the Yangshupu Water Plant of the Shanghai Waterworks Company should use 255 kilograms of coal for every 1,000 tons of water pumped. However, when the weather was very cold at the end of last year, coal consumption had already dropped to 205 kilograms; in August of this year, it dropped to 163 kilograms.

    According to staff members of the Shanghai branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company, in the process of saving coal this year, these more than 1,000 factories have also freed up more than 200,000 tons of high-quality coal for industrial construction needs because they are using less durable coal.

    Over the past year, relevant departments in Shanghai have held more than 50 city-wide, district-wide, and industry-wide meetings to widely exchange dozens of experiences in saving coal.

    In addition to factories, government offices, organizations, and schools in Shanghai have also paid attention to saving coal for daily life. Some effective methods for saving household coal consumption, after successful trials, will be promoted throughout the city in October.

    上海一千五百多个单位
    一年来节约十三万吨煤
    上海市一千五百多个工厂、机关、团体、学校，从去年九月份起，先后展开节约用煤以来，到现在已为国家节约了十三万吨以上的煤，价值四百多万元。
    开展节约用煤较早的一千多个工厂，现在的用煤量比去年九月以前平均降低百分之十五以上。上海市自来水公司杨树浦水厂去年国家规定每唧一千吨水用煤二百五十五公斤，可是在去年年底气候非常寒冷时，用煤量就已降到二百零五公斤；今年八月份又降到一百六十三公斤。
    据中国煤业建筑器材公司上海市公司工作人员谈，今年这一千多个工厂在节约用煤中，还因都用不耐烧的煤，比去年多腾出二十多万吨优质煤供工业建设需要。
    一年来，上海有关部门曾召开了五十多次全市性的、分区的以及行业性的会议，广泛交流了几十种节约用煤的经验。
    除各工厂外，上海市的机关、团体、学校也都注意了节约生活用煤。有些对节约家庭生活用煤的有效方法，经过试验成功后，十月份将在全市推广。
