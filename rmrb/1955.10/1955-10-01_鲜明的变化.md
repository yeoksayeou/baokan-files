Striking Changes
    Hao Jie
    From October 1954 to October 1955, the time is not considered long. If everyone looks back on their experiences of the past year, it is not difficult. However, to describe the enormous changes in the face of our motherland in the past year is really difficult to put into words: new factories have been established one after another, new agricultural cooperatives have been formed in the remote border areas and on the uncultivated wasteland, and new achievements have been made in production, trade, transportation, culture, and education... And what is even more difficult to describe is the leaps and bounds of growth in all aspects of hundreds of thousands of people, which are difficult to see with the eyes and cannot be calculated with numbers.
    Let us look at this situation from a small piece of land, from a corner of the vast motherland. This is a factory area in the eastern suburbs of the capital. In the past, this was just a field and sparsely populated farmhouses. In September last year, a new factory appeared here—the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Mill. And this year, less than a year after the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Mill started production, the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Mill has also been put into production, and the Beijing No. 3 Cotton Mill is also under construction. Opposite these three parallel factory buildings, a large number of workers' dormitories have also been occupied by new owners.
    As for the people, their ideological changes and technical growth are even more diverse. Although everyone's experiences are different, and the progress made in the past year is also different, everyone can tell you: I am very different from what I was a year ago.
    The Beijing No. 1 Cotton Mill officially started production in September last year. Among the nearly two thousand workers working in this factory, the vast majority are young people who have just come out of schools, rural areas, and families. When they first returned from studying in Qingdao, their work efficiency was very low. Each roving frame operator could only watch up to four hundred spindles, and each weaver could only watch up to twenty looms. Moreover, everyone was just starting to live a factory life. When they went to work, some girls would get together and laugh and make noise while driving their machines; some were not focused when patrolling and would even wander into other people's work areas... In short, they still did not understand, or even did not understand, what labor, machines, work collectives, trademark reputation, production discipline, production quotas, production schedules, saving raw materials, etc., were.
    But today, a year later, when you come to this factory again, what you see is completely different. The girls are excitedly welcoming the National Day, and the labor competition is in full swing. The walls of each workshop are covered with red and green challenge letters, response letters, and letters of determination. Almost every one ends with: "Guarantee to complete the above conditions and strive to wear a red flower to see Chairman Mao." The female workers wear white hats, and white work skirts are tightly fastened outside their floral shirts. They walk back and forth between the rows of machines, their steps are both agile and calm, without any confusion. Their hands are tense, but very skillful and proficient at joining threads. In short, everything is on track, and people are also experienced. The bulletin board on the wall records the production achievements of each person. The fine yarn roving frame operators who could only watch a maximum of four hundred spindles can now watch six hundred spindles; the weavers who could only watch a maximum of twenty looms can now watch twenty-four looms.
    All of this only illustrates a general picture. If you look at each person specifically, the changes in the past year are even more striking.
    Yang Yuzhen, from the fine yarn workshop, was a rural girl who had never even been to the county town a year ago. When she was at home, she learned to spin yarn with her mother, using a hand spinning wheel. She was so tired that her back ached, and she could only spin six taels of cotton a day. Her sister works in the Ministry of Textile Industry. Yang Yuzhen heard her say that there is a machine that spins yarn, and one person spins more yarn in a day than a hundred people using hand spinning wheels in a day, and the quality is even better. From then on, Yang Yuzhen thought day and night about becoming a textile worker. However, she had not thought about how to become a textile worker or how to use machines, and she could not imagine it either. When she first entered the factory, she heard the roaring sound of the machines, and her ears were so shaken that she seemed to hear nothing. The floor also seemed to be spinning under her feet. She was afraid that the machine would hit her, so she tightly grabbed her clothes and stood far away from the machine. But only a little over a year has passed, and Yang Yuzhen has not only become a skilled fine yarn roving frame operator, but also the one with the least amount of waste yarn in the entire workshop.
    Yang Yuzhen's progress is inseparable from her hard work, and it is not just Yang Yuzhen who is working hard. When every worker realizes that he is the master of the country, the upsurge of learning enthusiasm is not surprising at all. Cui Shuqin, who is now also the leader of the workshop union group, has been a porter since she was fourteen years old. Her thumb is very thick, and her second finger is also rounded. People say that she cannot be a fine yarn worker. But she insisted on becoming a fine yarn worker. In order to learn how to join threads, she lay in bed at night, and when everyone else was asleep, she was still using her hands to measure the joining of threads, and her fingers were rubbed bloody. In the end, she still learned it. Our thousands upon thousands of workers have grown up just like Cui Shuqin.
    These two fine yarn female workers, who are only eighteen years old, have now been elected as industrial labor models in Beijing. Their portraits and their exemplary deeds of humbly learning from experienced workers and conscientiously implementing the Hao Jianxiu work method are posted on the factory's honor roll.
    In our factory, young people have ample conditions to give full play to their talents and participate in management work. He Yaohuai, the female deputy workshop director and workshop party organization member of the fine yarn workshop, is a young mother, and her family life is very good. However, after watching the Soviet film "A Bright Path", she was determined to leave her family and become a textile worker. She initially learned to doff yarn. However, she thought that a person should become an expert with multiple skills like the Soviets. Therefore, after doffing the yarn, she watched how the roving frame operators joined threads and patrolled, and when they went to the toilet, she learned to help them. When doing cleaning work, she also paid attention to studying the structure of the machines. Slowly, she could also repair the machines if there were any minor problems. However, when she first entered the factory, her biggest shortcoming was that she had poor relations with the masses and liked to quarrel. The organization had educated her more than once on this matter: "Your work is very good, but it is not enough to just work well yourself. The cause of communism cannot be done by one person. It is necessary to unite everyone." After she worked hard to overcome this shortcoming, the leadership asked her to serve as the deputy workshop director, leading the work of twenty machines and twenty people. This is a deputy workshop director who is only twenty-two years old. In the fourteen groups in the fine yarn workshop, there are now three deputy workshop directors like her who are so young and have only one year of work experience. Being a deputy workshop director is not easy. It is necessary to have the ability to assume the dual leadership of administration and technology. Now the leadership is preparing to transfer them to the maintenance workshop to learn how to repair machines, so that they can more competently assume the task of deputy workshop director when they return.
    Of course, not all of the new workers in this factory initially wanted to be textile workers, especially those students who had just graduated from school. Before entering the factory, each person had their own ideals. Some wanted to be engineers, some wanted to be experts... However, when they did not pass the school entrance exams and obeyed the needs of the motherland to come to the factory, they all enthusiastically fell in love with their work.
    Wang Binghong, the maintenance worker in the drawing frame workshop, dreamed of becoming a geological prospector when he was in school, going to the remote northwest of the motherland to develop underground treasures, and letting others build factories and mines on the land he had walked on. After he did not pass the school entrance exams and came to this factory, the leadership assigned him to be a maintenance worker—oiling the machines. He felt that this work was not interesting, and he was careless in his work. However, once, because he carelessly loosened a small screw on the machine, the machine immediately made a sound. If the experienced worker had not heard it and quickly helped him tighten the screw, the machine would have had to stop for repairs for at least a day. How much loss would stopping the machine for a day cause to the country! From that time on, he realized that he could not underestimate a small screw, just like a factory cannot do without an oiler. After he figured it out, he fell in love with his work. Now, he not only oils the machines, but also learns to inspect the machines. He said: "I want to be an expert in repairing machines in the future. This is my ideal." Although his face still has a childish look when he speaks, it can be seen that he has grown up in the collective and has correctly chosen his career. Five months ago, he submitted a request to join the Communist Youth League.
    In just one year, what great changes, what great progress!
    With such young people who love labor, dare to overcome difficulties, and correct shortcomings, how can our factory not change its face?
    Now, the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Mill not only completes its production plan evenly every day, supplying the clothing needs of the people of the capital with a production capacity of more than 50,000 pieces of cotton yarn per year when it celebrates its first anniversary; but also the rate of good cloth has reached more than 99% (97% last year), and the amount of cotton used per piece of yarn has been reduced by more than 4 kilograms compared to last year.
    Our hundreds and hundreds of factories are being built and developed at such a speed; our thousands upon thousands of working people are learning the skills to build the motherland and changing their spiritual outlook at such a speed!

    鲜明的变化
    郝洁
    从一九五四年十月到一九五五年十月，时间并不算长，如果每一个人回顾一下一年来的经历，这并不是困难的。但是，要描绘一年来我们祖国的面貌的巨大变化，却实在难以下笔：新的工厂一个接着一个地建立起来了，新的农庄在遥远的边疆、在未开垦的荒地上组成了，生产、贸易、交通运输、文化教育各个方面都取得了新的成绩……而更难描写的，是用眼睛难以看到、用数字不能计算的成千成万的人在各方面的飞跃的成长。
    让我们从一小块地方，从广大祖国的一角来看看这种情况吧。这里是首都东郊的一个工厂区。过去，这里只是一片田野和疏疏落落的农庄。去年九月，这里出现了一座新的工厂——国棉一厂，而今年呢，国棉一厂开始生产不到一年，国棉二厂又投入生产了，国棉三厂也正在紧张施工。在这并列的三个厂房的对面，一大片职工宿舍也住进了新的主人。
    至于谈到人，他们的思想变化和技术的成长，更是各色各样的。尽管每一个人的经历不同，一年来的进步也不一样，但是，每一个人都可以向你说：我和一年以前大不相同了。
    北京国棉一厂是去年九月正式开工生产的。在这个厂工作的将近两千名工人中，绝大部分都是刚从学校、农村、家庭出来的年轻人。当她们刚从青岛学习回来的时候，工作效率很低，挡车工每人最多能看四百个纱锭，织布工每人最多能看二十台织布机。再说，大家刚刚开始过工厂生活，上班时，有些姑娘们开着车就凑到一块儿笑呀闹的；有的在巡回时思想不集中，竟串到别人的车挡里去了……总之，她们对于什么是劳动、机器、工作集体、商标信誉、生产纪律、生产定额、生产进度表、节约原料等等，都还认识得很不够，甚至没有认识。
    但是一年以后的今天，你再到这个厂里来，看到的就完全不同了。姑娘们正在心情激动地迎接国庆节，劳动竞赛开展得轰轰烈烈，每一个车间的墙壁上都贴满了红红绿绿的挑战书、应战书和决心书，几乎每一份的最后都这样写着：保证完成以上条件，争取戴上红花去见毛主席。女工们戴着白色的帽子，花布衬衣外面紧紧地束着白色的工作裙，在机器的行列间走来走去，步态既敏捷，又沉着，没有丝毫忙乱。她们那接线的手虽然动作很紧张，但很灵巧，很熟练。总之，一切都上了轨道，人也老练了。墙上的公布牌上记载着每个人的生产成绩，原来最多只能看四百纱锭的细纱挡车工，现在已能看六百锭；原来最多只能看二十台织布机的织布工，现在已能看二十四台了。
    这一切，还只说明了一个概貌，如果再具体地来看每一个人，一年来的变化就更鲜明了。
    细纱车间的杨玉珍，一年多以前是个连县城都没有进过的农村姑娘。她在家时，就跟着妈妈学着纺线，用的是手纺车，一天累得腰酸膀子痛，才能纺六两棉花。她的姐姐在中纺部工作，杨玉珍听她说，有一种机器纺线，一个人一天纺的线比一百个人用手纺车一天纺的线还要多，质量还要好。从那时起，杨玉珍就日夜想着做个纺织女工。但是，怎样做纺织女工，怎样使用机器，她是没有想过的，而且也想像不出来。刚一进厂时，她听到那机器隆隆的响声，耳朵震得好像什么都听不见了，地板也似乎在自己的脚下旋转起来，她唯恐机器会打着自己，紧紧地抓住衣裳站得离机器远远的。但是时间只过了一年多，杨玉珍不仅已经成为一个熟练的细纱挡车工，而且是全车间白花出得最少的一个。
    杨玉珍的进步是和她的苦学分不开的，而苦学的也不只是杨玉珍一个人。当每一个工人都了解到他是国家的主人的时候，学习情绪的高涨是一点也不奇怪的。现在兼任车间工会小组长的崔淑琴，从十四岁就当搬运工，大拇指练得很粗，二拇指也磨圆了，人家都说她不能当细纱工。可是她偏偏要当细纱工。为了学会接头，晚间躺在被窝里，人家都睡了，她还在用手比量着接头，把手指头都磨出了血。到底她还是学会了。我国千千万万的工人，也正是像崔淑琴一样成长起来的。
    这两个年仅十八岁的细纱女工，现在都当选了北京市的工业劳动模范。她们的像片和她们虚心向老师傅学习，认真执行郝建秀工作法的模范事迹，却被贴在工厂的光荣榜上。
    在我们的工厂里，年轻人有着充分发挥自己才能的条件和参加管理工作的机会。细纱车间的女副工长兼车间党的组织委员何耀怀，是个年轻的妈妈，家里的生活很好。但是当她看了苏联电影“光明之路”以后，下决心要走出家庭做个纺织女工。她起初学的是落纱工，但是，她想一个人应该像苏联人那样，成为有多种技能的专家。因此，她在落完纱后，就看着挡车工怎样接头，怎样巡回，等她们上厕所时，就学着帮她们做。在做清洁工作时，也注意研究机器的构造，慢慢地，机器有点小毛病，她也会修理了。但是，她刚一进厂时，有个最大的缺点，就是群众关系不好，爱吵架，组织上因为这事，不止一次地教育过她：“你工作挺好，但光自己工作好还不行，共产主义事业不是一个人能干好的，必须要团结大家。”当她努力克服了这个缺点以后，领导上就叫她担任了副工长，领导二十台车和二十个人的工作。这是个年仅二十二岁的副工长，在细纱车间十四个小组中，像她这样年轻的才有一年工龄的副工长，现在已经有了三个。做一个副工长，可不简单，要有能担当起行政和技术双重领导的能力。现在领导上正准备调她们去保全车间学习修理机器，以便回来更称职地担负起副工长的任务。
    当然，这个厂子里的所有的新工人，最初并不都是想作纺织工人的，特别是那些刚出校门的学生们，在未走进工厂之前，各人有各人的理想，有的想当工程师，有的想当专家……但是，当他们没有考上学校，服从祖国的需要到工厂来以后，都热烈地爱上了自己的工作。
    钢并粗车间的保养工王秉洪在学校时的理想是做个地质勘探家，到祖国遥远的大西北去开发地下的宝藏，让别人在自己走过的土地上建设起工厂和矿山。当他没有考上学校来到这个工厂以后，领导上分配他做保养工——给机器上油。他觉得这件工作没有意思，工作吊儿浪当。可是，有一次，因为他马马虎虎地把机器上的一个小螺丝拧松了，机器马上发出了声响，要不是老师傅听见了赶紧帮他把螺丝拧紧，那台机器至少得停车修理一天。停一天车，给国家造成多大损失啊！从那次以后，他才知道不能小看一个小螺丝钉，就像工厂里不能少掉加油工一样。他想通了以后，就爱上了自己的工作。现在，他不光给机器加油，还学会了检查机器。他说：“我将来要作一名修理机器的专家，这就是我的理想。”虽然他那说话的脸上还带有孩子气，但看得出来，他已在集体中成长起来，并正确地选择了自己的职业。五个月前，他提出了加入青年团的要求。
    仅仅一年，多大的变化，多大的进步啊！
    有了这样一些热爱劳动、勇于克服困难、改正缺点的年轻人，我们的工厂怎么会不改变面貌呢？
    现在的北京国棉一厂，不但每天都能均衡地完成生产计划，在开工一周年的时候，以年产五万多件棉纱的生产能力供应首都人民的衣着需要；而且正布率已达到百分之九十九以上（去年是百分之九十七），每件纱的用棉量比去年降低了四公斤多。
    我们的成千成百的工厂，就是以这样的速度在建设着、发展着；我们的千千万万的劳动人民，就是以这样的速度在学习建设祖国的本领和改变着自己的精神面貌！
