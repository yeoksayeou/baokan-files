Xinhua News Agency, Paris: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a plenary session on October 19th and 20th in Saint-Denis, near Paris, to discuss the situation of farmers and the party's rural work.

    Waldeck Rochet, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, delivered a report at the meeting. He analyzed in detail the situation of French farmers, explained the Communist Party's agricultural program, and outlined the tasks for improving the party's work in rural areas. In his report, Rochet also refuted the argument by some economists that there was no capital concentration in the French countryside. He said that from 1929 to 1946, about 600,000 small farmers were eliminated. From 1946 to the present, about 400,000 small farmers have been eliminated.

    The meeting then began a discussion of Rochet's report.

    Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, spoke at the closing session. He pointed out that the French Communist Party has broad support from the peasant masses, with 30 to 40 percent of rural residents voting for Communist Party candidates in elections. The reason why the Communist Party has this influence in the countryside is that it defends the basic demands of French farmers in its activities.

    He said that the Communist Party believes that tillers should own their land and that the land occupied by large landowners should be returned to the exploited. All of this should be implemented in a way that best serves the interests of society and agriculture itself, and promotes the material well-being of farmers.

    Thorez pointed out that strengthening the alliance between the working class and the working peasants is the party's main responsibility, and this is of even greater significance at present. He said: "We must strengthen the worker-peasant alliance today because everyone should fight against the increasing capitalist economic offensive and against the phenomenon of poverty. We must strengthen the worker-peasant alliance today in order to repel the reactionary forces, defend democratic freedoms, and shatter obscurantism. We must strengthen the worker-peasant alliance today because national independence is still threatened. We must strengthen the worker-peasant alliance in order to drive the specter of war, which has already begun to retreat, even further away. This alliance is necessary in order to bring France's foreign policy onto the path of making decisions through negotiations (including negotiations with the people of the French Federation), onto the path of fruitful economic exchanges with socialist countries, and onto the path of implementing effective disarmament."

    Thorez called on Communist Party members and all party organizations to widely explain the party's policies, based on the principles of peace, national independence, guaranteeing democratic freedoms, and social progress, to the working farmers of France.

    The meeting adopted a resolution on Rochet's report. The resolution pointed out that the continuous impoverishment of agricultural workers and small farmers is determined by the laws of capitalist economics, and that the worker-peasant alliance is a necessary condition for a successful struggle to achieve a rapid change in France's policy direction and to strive for the future socialist cause.

    The Central Committee of the French Communist Party called on the entire party to strengthen and improve the party's work in rural areas.

    法共中央全会讨论农民情况和农村工作
    新华社二十二日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党中央委员会十月十九日和二十日在巴黎近郊的圣但尼举行全体会议，讨论农民情况和党的农村工作问题。
    法国共产党中央委员会政治局委员瓦德克·罗歇在会上作了报告。他详细地分析了法国农民的情况，说明了共产党的农业纲领，并且说明了改善党在农村中的工作的任务。罗歇在报告中还驳斥了某些经济学家所谓法国农村中没有资本集中现象的论调。他说：从一九二九年到一九四六年，约有六十万户小农被消灭。从一九四六年到现在，约有四十万户小农被消灭。
    会议随后就罗歇的报告展开了讨论。
    法国共产党总书记多列士在闭幕会议上讲了话。他指出：法国共产党得到农民群众的广泛支持，有百分之三十到四十的农村居民在选举中投共产党候选人的票。共产党所以在农村中具有这种影响，是因为它在自己的活动中捍卫法国农民的基本要求。
    他说：共产党认为应当实行耕者有其田，应当把大地主占有的土地归还被剥削者。这一切应当以最符合于社会和农业本身的利益并且能促进农民物质福利的形式来实行。
    多列士指出，加强工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟是党的主要责任，这在目前具有更重大的意义。他说：我们今天所以要加强工农联盟，是因为大家都应当为反抗资本主义经济进攻的加强，为反抗穷困的现象而斗争。我们今天要加强工农联盟，以便击退反动势力，保卫民主自由，粉碎曚昧主义。我们今天要加强工农联盟，因为民族的独立仍然受到威胁。我们要加强工农联盟，以便把已经开始退却的战争魔影驱逐得更远。这个联盟之所以必要，是因为要把法国的外交政策带上通过谈判（包括同法兰西联邦各国人民的谈判）作出决定的道路，带上同社会主义阵营国家进行有成果的经济交流的道路，带上实行有效的裁军的道路。
    多列士号召共产党员和党的所有组织向法国劳动农民广泛地解释以和平、民族独立、保障民主自由和社会进步这些原则为基础的党的政策。
    会议就罗歇的报告通过了一项决议。决议指出，农业工人和小农的不断贫困化是由资本主义经济规律决定的，工农联盟是为争取迅速改变法国政策方针、争取未来的社会主义事业而进行成功的斗争的必要条件。
    法国共产党中央委员会号召全党加强和改进党在农村中的工作。
