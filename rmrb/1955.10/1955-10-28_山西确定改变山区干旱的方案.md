Shanxi Province has suffered some disasters this year. Recently, the province convened a provincial production and disaster relief conference. The conference studied and verified the disaster situation and formulated a plan to initially change the situation of "nine droughts in ten years" in the mountainous areas through production and self-salvation.

    The conference decided to add 2.8 million yuan to the previously issued 4.83 million yuan of production and disaster relief loans.

    In the barren mountainous areas along the Yellow River, including Zuoyun, Pinglu, Baode and 15 other counties, the method of work-for-relief will be adopted to carry out soil and water conservation work such as building dams for siltation, digging wells, and excavating reservoirs. Ensure that everyone has one mu of water-irrigated land or soil and water conservation land.

    The conference also plans to build more than a hundred water conservancy projects in the disaster areas. Through opening canals, installing water pumps, digging reservoirs, and expanding the irrigated area by 470,000 mu, it will mobilize farmers to build small-scale water conservancy projects with less than a thousand mu of irrigated land.

    At the same time, a work-for-relief plan was also formulated to repair four highways with a total length of 880 kilometers, closely connecting the mountainous areas and cities.

    After these measures are implemented, not only will farmers be able to overcome this year's famine, but also create favorable conditions for changing the face of the mountainous areas.

    山西确定改变山区干旱的方案
    山西省部分地区今年遭受了一些灾害，最近，省里召开了全省生产救灾会议，会上研究和核实了灾情，并制定了通过生产自救初步改变山区十年九旱的方案。
    会上决定除以前发放的四百八十三万元生产救灾贷款外，又增加了二百八十万元。
    对黄河沿岸贫瘠山区的左云、平鲁、保德等十八县，采取以工代赈的方式，进行打坝淤地、打井、挖泊池等水土保持工作。使每人都能有一亩水地或水土保墒地。
    会议还计划在灾区修建百多处水利工程，通过开渠、安抽水机、挖水库、扩大浇地面积四十七万亩，并发动农民兴修浇地千亩以下的小型水利。
    同时，还制定了以工代赈，整修四条共长八百八十公里的公路，把山区和城市密切地联系起来。
    这些措施实现后，不仅能使农民渡过今年灾荒，并为改变山区面貌创造了有利条件。
