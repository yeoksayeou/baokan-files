Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has about 30% of the Youth League members and about 15% of the youth joining agricultural cooperatives in rural areas. About 30% of the Youth League members who joined the cooperatives and about 10% of the youth who joined the cooperatives have been trained as key members of the cooperatives. Bai Yunxiang, a revolutionary disabled soldier and Youth League member, lost a leg in the war, and has now been trained by the XinSheng Agricultural Cooperative in Tongliao County to become an excellent accountant. Wang Fuhai of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Langshan County humbly learned from the experienced farmers, eliminated weeds and pests in the fields, and promoted the method of using Sophora alopecuroides to make fertilizer, and has become a cooperative director loved by the members. Cao Guoyu, an eighteen-year-old party member from Jining County, was originally the daughter of a hired peasant. Under the cultivation of the Party and the League, she became the leader of a mutual aid team. After the mutual aid team was transformed into an agricultural cooperative, she was elected as the director of the cooperative. Because of her conscientious and responsible work, her ability to endure hardship, and her selflessness, she has been selected as a national youth activist in socialist construction.

    内蒙古农业合作社注意培养青年骨干
    内蒙古自治区农村已有百分之三十左右的青年团员和百分之十五左右的青年加入了农业合作社。有百分之三十左右的入社青年团员和百分之十左右的入社青年被培养成为社的骨干。革命残废军人、青年团员白云翔在战争中失掉了一条腿，现在已被通辽县新生农业合作社培养成为优秀的会计。狼山县先锋农业合作社王福海虚心向老农学习，消灭了地里的杂草、虫害，推广了用苦豆草沤肥的方法，已经成为社员所爱戴的社主任。集宁县十八岁的党员曹果鱼原先是一个雇农的女儿，在党、团的培养下，当了互助组组长，互助组转为农业合作社后，她又被选为社主任。因为工作认真负责、吃苦耐劳、大公无私，她已被选为全国青年社会主义建设积极分子。
