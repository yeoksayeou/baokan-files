Xinhua News Agency, October 10th. With the exception of a few individual projects, the machine manufacturing plant projects above the quota planned by the First Ministry of Machine Building to be completed and put into production before 1957 have all officially commenced construction. These include factories manufacturing automobiles, new-style locomotives, large ships, large and precision machine tools, medium and large power generating equipment, and metallurgical and mining equipment. Among them, several factories, such as the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant and the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Plant, have been completed or put into production. The majority of the remaining factories will also be completed and put into production next year.

Dozens of projects that are still under construction are currently undergoing intensive work. The civil engineering construction of factories such as the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, the Harbin Electricity Meter Instrument Plant, the Shenyang Wire Factory, and the Shanghai Boiler Factory have entered the final stages and are installing the last batch of equipment. It is expected that most of them can be put into production by the end of this year and the beginning of next year. Among them, several large-scale factories such as the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant have already started trial production in many workshops, actively creating conditions for formal production. More than ten factories, such as the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the Shenyang Transformer Factory, have completed most of their civil engineering construction and are installing equipment on a large scale. To date, auxiliary workshops of the main workshops of the No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant, with the exception of a few, are installing a large number of machines and equipment; many installed machines have already begun trial production, and the power station's generator recently started transmitting electricity. The workers constructing this factory have decided to strive to produce automobiles for the motherland next year.

In this batch of factories under construction, as the amount of civil engineering construction gradually decreases, the amount of equipment installation work is constantly increasing. In order to ensure the smooth construction of large-scale equipment installation projects, the First Ministry of Machine Building recently established an installation general company to strengthen the business leadership of installation work, and at the same time, it transferred a group of cadres and installation workers to construction units with heavy installation tasks. In addition, all construction units have universally strengthened equipment supply work so that large quantities of equipment can be transported to various construction sites in a timely manner to ensure that equipment installation by various construction units can proceed continuously.

    计划在一九五七年前完工投入生产
    几十个机器制造厂紧张施工
    新华社十日讯　第一机械工业部计划在一九五七年前完工生产的限额以上的机器制造厂工程，除个别项目外，都已正式施工。它们包括制造汽车、新式机车、大型船舶、大型和精密的工作母机、中型和大型发电设备、冶金和矿山设备等产品的工厂，其中哈尔滨量具刃具厂、沈阳风动工具厂等几个厂已经建成或投入生产，其余大部分也都将在明年建成或投入生产。
    这批工程中尚未完工的几十个工程目前都在紧张施工。沈阳第一机床厂、哈尔滨电表仪器厂、沈阳电线厂、上海锅炉厂等工厂，土木建筑工程都已进入收尾阶段，并正在安装最后一批设备，预计在今年年底和明年年初大都可以投入生产。其中规模巨大的沈阳第一机床厂等几个厂，已有许多车间开始了试生产，积极为正式生产创造条件。长春第一汽车制造厂、沈阳变压器厂等十多个工厂，土木建筑工程已完成了大部分，正在大规模地安装设备。到目前止，第一汽车制造厂各主要车间的附属车间，除个别的以外，都在大量安装机器设备；不少安装好了的机器已开始试生产，热电站的发电机已在不久前发出电力。建设这个工厂的职工们已决定争取在明年为祖国生产出汽车来。
    正在施工的这批工厂，随着土木建筑工程施工量逐渐减少，设备安装工程量正在不断增加。为了保证大规模设备安装工程顺利施工，第一机械工业部最近成立了安装总公司，以加强安装工作的业务领导，同时调配了一批干部和安装工人配备到安装任务繁重的施工单位。此外，各建设单位都普遍加强了设备供应工作，使大批的设备能及时运到各工地，以保证各施工单位的设备安装能连续进行。
