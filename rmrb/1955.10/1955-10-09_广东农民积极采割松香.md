Guangdong farmers are actively harvesting pine resin
Guangdong Province is currently in the peak season for pine resin production, with daily purchases reaching around 2,500 dan. As of the end of August, the province had harvested more than 350,000 dan of pine resin, an increase of more than 50% compared to the same period last year. It is expected that pine resin production this year will exceed the state plan.

This year, various localities in Guangdong Province have mobilized the masses to participate in pine resin harvesting through various meetings. In the Fifth District of Shixing County, the number of farmers who previously harvested resin did not exceed ten, but now there are more than four hundred; the output has increased from the original 600 jin per day to more than 5,000 jin. Lechang County also organized 183 unemployed urban workers to participate in resin harvesting production; the number of resin-producing trees harvested increased from more than 19,000 to more than 69,000.

    广东农民积极采割松香
    广东省目前正是松香旺产季节，每天收购量达二千五百担左右。截至八月底为止，全省已采割松香三十五万多担，比去年同期增加了百分之五十以上。预计今年松香生产将超额完成国家计划。
    今年广东省各地通过各种会议发动群众参加采割松香的生产。始兴县五区过去割香的农民不超过十人，现在已有四百多人；产量由原来的每天六百斤增加到五千斤以上。乐昌县还组织城市失业工人一百八十三人参加割香生产；采割的香树由一万九千多株增加到六万九千多株。
