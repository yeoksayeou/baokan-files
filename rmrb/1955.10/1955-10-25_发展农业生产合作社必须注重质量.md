Developing Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives Must Focus on Quality

The agricultural collectivization movement is advancing under the active and planned leadership of Party committees at all levels.

The agricultural collectivization movement in the vast majority of regions across the country is vigorous, progressing rapidly, and is very healthy. Cadres and masses in Heilongjiang Province report that this year's establishment and expansion of cooperatives has "three goods": the policy of voluntary mutual benefit is well implemented, poor and middle peasants are well united, and it is well integrated with production. Many other regions have similar reports. Some provinces have already successfully completed or overfulfilled their original plans for developing cooperatives this winter and next spring. This proves that the Party Central Committee's guidelines are completely correct.

Of course, this is not to say that there are no problems in the agricultural collectivization movement in every place. According to a recent inspection by the Fujian Provincial Party Committee, in the province's eight thousand townships, the situation is very good in 40 to 50 percent of the townships. The ideological level of Party members and activists has improved, the publicity to the masses is relatively comprehensive and in-depth, the class policy is well implemented, and attention is paid to leading current production, with great enthusiasm and high morale among peasants and cadres. However, 30 to 40 percent of the townships are not very good. There, only the ideological problems of Party members and cadres have been solved well, but the publicity to the masses is still insufficient and has a one-sidedness, only talking about relying on poor peasants, and not talking or rarely talking about consolidating the unity of middle peasants, thus increasing the concerns of some middle peasants. In some townships, the propaganda is just reading from the book, and seeing some activists asking to join the cooperative, they think that the "high tide is coming," and no longer do in-depth and hard work, and hastily start establishing the cooperative; some even put forward wrong slogans of disguised coercion, or use "challenge competitions" to mobilize the masses to sign up to join the cooperative; some blank townships that originally did not have a single cooperative, suddenly put forward the slogan of "100% collectivization." The Fujian Provincial Party Committee's timely and in-depth inspection and study of the current problems in the movement is very necessary. Only in this way can shortcomings be corrected in a timely manner. From these situations, we can see that the healthy side of the movement is still the mainstream; however, simple and rough, unrealistic practices have also occurred, and these should be seriously noted and prevented.

Other regions have similar situations. According to an inspection by the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, by the end of September, the number of established cooperatives had greatly exceeded the original plan of the Provincial Party Committee. Most of these new cooperatives are very good. However, the work in some counties, districts, and townships is relatively rough. Many staff members are eager to compete for advancement, rush to complete tasks, and compare numbers; in propaganda work, there are phenomena of quoting out of context and even speaking irresponsibly; some places started without planning; and many specific economic problems and mass ideological problems urgently need to be solved in the newly established cooperatives.

Is it unnecessary "alarmism" to point out these situations when a new high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement has just arrived? Since the mainstream is healthy, is it unnecessary to pay attention to some unhealthy phenomena on the non-mainstream side? Of course, it is definitely not like that. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us in the article "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "Deviations are inevitable in the movement, this is understandable and not difficult to correct. The shortcomings or mistakes existing among cadres and peasants will be overcome or corrected as long as we actively help them." What counts as active help? This is to point out the shortcomings in the work as early as possible, and tell rural workers and the masses of peasants the methods to correct the shortcomings. Problems should be solved as soon as they arise, so as not to let problems pile up and seriously affect the quality of agricultural producers' cooperatives.

In order to ensure that agricultural cooperatives have a high quality, there should be sufficient preparation before the establishment of the cooperatives. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the article "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" that it is necessary to criticize erroneous ideas, sum up work experience; comprehensively publicize the principles, policies and methods of cooperation to the peasant masses, formulate comprehensive plans; train cooperative cadres; and greatly develop mutual aid teams. All five of these preparatory tasks must be done well. With these preparations, we can combine the leadership of the Party with the enthusiasm of the masses to run the cooperatives, and it is possible to basically solve the problem of the unity of quantity and quality in the development of cooperatives. Some places regard the conditions necessary for the establishment of cooperatives, such as the voluntary participation of the masses, as "restrictive rules" to be opposed, which is to go from one deviation to another. The "restrictive rules" that bind the socialist enthusiasm of the masses must be abolished, but the conditions that ensure the quality of the cooperatives must be adhered to.

An important condition for ensuring the quality of cooperatives is to carry out extensive and in-depth ideological education for the peasant masses. Judging from the actual movement in various places, some comrades are currently neglecting this task. Some comrades believe that the enthusiasm of the masses is very high, and it is not necessary to carry out universal and detailed propaganda and education work among the masses. This idea is incorrect. It should be understood that the high enthusiasm of the masses to join the cooperative does not mean that they fully understand the Party's principles, policies and methods for agricultural cooperation; the understanding of a part of the people does not mean that all peasants understand. Some staff members only paid attention to general appeals and universal publicity, while relaxing or even abandoning specific and in-depth ideological education work. They believe that "individual education is a handicraft method and is not suitable for the needs of the high tide." This view is also incorrect. Individual work for the specific circumstances of each member should not be called a handicraft method. Relying on core members and activists, and carrying out in-depth, meticulous, and individual ideological education work for the specific ideological situation of each member at each stage, is indispensable at any time. In the entire process of establishing a cooperative, from the initiation of registration, the discussion of the articles of association, the handling of means of production, to the establishment of organizational structures and the investment in collective production, any work that deviates from ideological education work cannot be done well and will affect the quality of agricultural producers' cooperatives.

Some places still ignore the "comprehensive planning" in the five preparatory tasks. The plan for establishing cooperatives in Hebei Province this winter and next spring can be completed by the end of October. However, in many places, the comprehensive planning is done simply, or the planning is not followed during the establishment of the cooperatives; many places ignore the consolidation work of the original cooperatives, or only pay attention to consolidation in words, without doing specific work, and even fail to grasp the current most urgent autumn harvest distribution and autumn plowing and wheat planting. The staff of Nan Shi Village Township in Wenan County, in order to establish the cooperative as soon as possible, began to mobilize the establishment of the cooperative without serious planning; as a result, 21 upper-middle peasant households were unwilling to run the cooperative with the poor peasants, so they organized an upper-middle peasant cooperative by themselves; and a saboteur also wooed 13 peasant households to organize a fake cooperative; in addition, among the five cooperatives planned to be established in the township, one cooperative does not yet have leading core members. These phenomena that seriously affect the quality of agricultural producers' cooperatives must be overcome.

After the agricultural producers' cooperative is established, rectification work should also be done well in order to continuously improve the quality of the cooperative. It should be understood that stopping development and "resolutely shrinking" are not conducive to consolidation; at the same time, it should also be understood that cooperatives will not consolidate themselves if they only pay attention to development and not rectification. Rectification work should be carried out two to three times a year in accordance with the "Resolution on Agricultural Cooperation Issues" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee (Enlarged). The regions where cooperatives are currently being established should not abandon the rectification and consolidation of existing cooperatives, but should take the existing cooperatives a step further during the autumn harvest distribution and autumn plowing and autumn planting, so that they can more powerfully drive and help many new cooperatives. In areas where the establishment of cooperatives has come to an end, "there must be a period of stopping development for rectification, and then developing a batch of cooperatives" ("On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation"). The Hebei Provincial Party Committee has decided to shift to comprehensive rectification work from November after completing the current batch of cooperative establishment plans. The Shandong Provincial Party Committee has also decided that the regions that have completed the plan for establishing cooperatives this winter will devote all their efforts to the first rectification and consolidation work of the new cooperatives, first solving the current urgent problems of these new cooperatives, organizing the current production work, and at the same time making overall plans for further rectification and consolidation. It is right for them to do so. Just as those subjectivists who blindly pursue percentages cannot be allowed to use "opposing rightism" as their excuse, similarly, right-leaning opportunists cannot be allowed to use "paying attention to quality" as their excuse. The Party's requirement for us is: we must do more and do better; we must have both quantity and quality. Countless past experiences have proven that it is entirely possible to achieve this requirement. The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee summarized past experiences and pointed out future principles, policies and methods. All rural workers will resolutely act in accordance with this resolution, and they will definitely achieve the goal of running the cooperatives well and in large numbers.

### 发展农业生产合作社必须注重质量

    发展农业生产合作社必须注重质量
    农业合作化运动正在各级党委的积极的、有计划的领导下前进。
    全国绝大部分地区的农业合作化运动声势浩大，进展迅速，而且是很健康的。黑龙江省各地干部和群众反映，今年的建社扩社工作有“三好”：自愿互利政策执行得好，贫农中农团结得好，结合生产搞得好。别的许多地区也有类似的反映。各省原定今冬明春发展合作社的计划，有的已经顺利地提前完成或超额完成了。这证明了党中央规定的方针是完全正确的。
    当然，这并不是说，每一个地方的农业合作化运动都没有什么问题。据福建省委最近检查，全省的八千个乡，在合作化运动当中，有百分之四十到五十的乡情况是很好的。党员、积极分子思想水平提高了，对群众的宣传也比较全面和深入，阶级政策执行得也好，并且注意了领导当前的生产，农民和干部劲头很大，情绪饱满。但有百分之三十到四十的乡不很好。那里只有党员、干部思想问题解决得还好，对群众宣传却还不够，并且有片面性，只讲依靠贫农，不讲或很少讲巩固地团结中农的道理，因而增加了一些中农的顾虑。还有一些乡宣传的时候只是照本宣读，看到一些积极分子要求入社就认为“高潮来了”，不再深入地艰苦地做工作，就匆忙地开始建社；有的甚至提出了变相强迫的错误口号，或者用“挑战竞赛”办法动员群众报名入社；有些原来没有一个社的空白乡，却一下子提出了“百分之百合作化”的口号。福建省委及时地进行深入的检查，研究当前运动中的问题，是十分必要的。只有这样，才能及时纠正缺点。从这些情况当中可以看到：运动的健康的一面仍然是主流；可是，简单粗糙、不切实际的做法也发生了，这些都应该严重地加以注意和防止。
    别的地区也有类似情况。据山东省委检查，到九月底止，建社数目已经大大超过了省委原定计划。这些新社大部分都很好。但也有些县、区、乡的工作比较粗糙。不少工作人员急于争先进，赶任务，比数字；在宣传工作中，有断章取义甚至信口开河的现象；有些地方没有规划就干起来了；已建成的新社，也有许多具体经济问题和群众思想问题急待解决。
    在农业合作化运动的新高潮刚刚到来的时候就指出这些情况，是不是不必要的“大惊小怪”呢？既然主流方面是健康的，非主流方面的一些不健康现象是不是就不必去注意了呢？当然决不是这样。毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”一文中教导我们：“运动中免不了要出些偏差，这是可以理解的，也是不难纠正的。干部中和农民中存在的缺点或错误，只要我们积极地去帮助他们，就会克服或纠正。”怎样才算是积极帮助呢？这就是及早指出工作中的缺点，并且把纠正缺点的办法告诉给农村工作人员和农民群众。一有问题就去解决，才不至于使问题成堆，严重影响农业生产合作社的质量。
    为着保证农业合作社具有较高的质量，在建社以前，要有充分准备。毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”一文中指出，要批判错误思想，总结工作经验；向农民群众全面地宣传合作化的方针、政策和办法，制定全面规划；训练办社干部；大量发展互助组。这五项准备工作必须全都做好。做好了这些准备工作，就可以把党的领导和群众办社的积极性结合起来，就可能基本上解决合作社发展的数量和质量统一的问题。有的地方把建社所必需的群众自愿等条件也当作“清规戒律”加以反对，那就是从一个偏向走到了另一个偏向。束缚群众的社会主义积极性的“清规戒律”一定要废除，而保证合作社的质量的条件却一定要坚持。
    保证合作社质量的重要条件是对农民群众进行广泛、深入的思想教育。从各地的实际运动情况看来，目前有一部分同志恰恰忽视了这一项工作。有些同志认为，群众的积极性很高，不必要再在群众中普遍地细致地进行宣传教育工作了。这种想法是不正确的。应该了解：群众入社积极性高，不等于完全理解了党关于农业合作化的方针、政策和办法；一部分人理解了，不等于全体农民都理解了。还有一些工作人员只注意了一般的号召和普遍的宣传，而放松了甚至放弃了具体的、深入的思想教育工作。他们认为“个别教育是手工业方式，不适合高潮的需要”。这种看法也是不对的。不应该把针对各个社员的具体情况进行个别的工作叫做手工业方式。依靠骨干分子、积极分子，针对各个社员各个时期的具体思想情况，进行深入的、细致的、个别的思想教育工作，在任何时候都是不可缺少的。在建社的全部过程中，从发动报名、议定章程、处理生产资料，到建立组织机构、投入集体生产，任何一段工作，如果脱离了思想教育工作，都不可能做好，都会影响农业生产合作社的质量。
    对于五项准备工作中的“全面规划”这一项工作，也有一些地方仍然忽视。河北省各地今冬明春的建社计划十月底就可以完成。但是，其中也有不少地方对于全面规划简单从事，或在建社中不按照规划办事；不少地方忽视原有社的巩固工作，或者只是口头上注意巩固，没有做具体工作，甚至对当前最紧迫的秋收分配和秋耕种麦也没有抓紧。文安县南史村乡的工作人员，为了早些把社建成，没有认真进行规划就开始动员建社；结果有二十一户上中农不愿同贫农一起办社，就自行组织了一个上中农社；还有一个破坏分子拉拢十三户农民组织起一个假合作社；另外，全乡计划建立的五个社当中，有一个社还没有领导骨干。这些严重地影响农业生产合作社质量的现象一定要设法克服。
    在建成农业生产合作社以后，还要做好整顿工作，才能不断提高合作社的质量。应当了解：停止发展和“坚决收缩”都不利于巩固；同时还应当了解：绝不是只注意发展、不注意整顿，合作社就会自己巩固下来。应当按照七届六中全会（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议，一年进行两次到三次整社工作。目前正在建社的地区，不可撇开现有的合作社的整顿巩固工作，而应当在秋收分配和秋耕秋种中间，把现有的社提高一步，使它们能够更有力地带动和帮助许多新社。目前建社工作已经告一段落的地区，“必须有一个停止发展进行整顿的时间，然后再去发展一批合作社”（“关于农业合作化问题”）。河北省委已经决定在完成当前这一批建社计划之后，从十一月起，转入全面整顿工作。山东省委也已经决定，完成今冬建社计划的地区，全力转入新社的第一次整顿巩固工作，先解决这些新社当前的迫切问题，组织当前的生产工作，同时做出进一步整顿巩固的通盘打算。他们这样做是正确的。　正像不能允许盲目追求百分比的主观主义者以“反对右倾”作为他们的借口一样，同样不能允许右倾机会主义者以“注重质量”作为他们的借口。党对我们的要求是：既要办多，又要办好；既要数量，又要质量。过去无数经验证明，实现这个要求是完全可能的。七届六中全会的决议，总结了过去的经验，指出了今后的方针政策和办法。全体农村工作人员坚决地按照这个决议办事，就一定会达到把合作社办得又好又多的目的。
