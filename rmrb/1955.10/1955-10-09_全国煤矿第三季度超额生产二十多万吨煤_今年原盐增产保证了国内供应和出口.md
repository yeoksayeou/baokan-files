Xinhua News Agency, 7th: National state-owned coal mines overfulfilled the third quarter production tasks, producing more than 200,000 tons of raw coal for the country, an increase of more than 21 percent compared with the same period last year.

Due to the widespread increase in production and thrift movement in state-owned coal mines across the country, production costs have gradually decreased. In July and August alone, more than 3.5 million yuan was saved compared to the national plan. The coal mines in Fushun, Fuxin, Jiaohe, Beipiao, Datong, Yangquan, Jiawang, and Zibo achieved relatively significant results. Fuxin Coal Mine reduced costs by more than 1.2 million yuan in August alone. Many units have also made new gains in saving raw materials. Kailuan Coal Mine actively improved operating methods, improved the recovery and reuse rate of pit wood, and actively used reinforced concrete tunnel supports, reversing the past situation of frequent overspending on pit wood.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th: As of mid-September, national crude salt production has completed 100.6 percent of the annual plan, an increase of 26.87 percent over last year, and an increase of 20.59 percent over the highest annual output in history (1952). Among them, the four major sea salt areas of Changlu, Liaoning, Huaibei, and Shandong not only completed the annual plan, but also overfulfilled the increased production plan by 20.46 percent. The salt workers in these four major sea salt areas have decided to increase crude salt production for the country by another 300,000 tons this year in addition to completing the annual plan and the increased production plan, and strive to improve the quality of crude salt.

The large increase in crude salt production this year not only guarantees the supply of edible salt nationwide and the needs of industrial, agricultural, and fishery salt and export salt, but also accumulates a large amount of construction funds for the country.

The reasons for the increased production of crude salt this year, in addition to the better natural conditions and the generally lower rainfall during the rainy season than in previous years, are mainly that the majority of employees actively responded to the call for increased production and thrift, and implemented the policy of "flood prevention combined with production." During the rainy season, they generally did a good job in preventing typhoons, floods, and floods, while seizing favorable weather conditions, actively repairing beaches, nourishing brine, preserving brine, and producing salt.

    全国煤矿第三季度超额生产二十多万吨煤
    今年原盐增产保证了国内供应和出口
    新华社七日讯　全国国营煤矿超额完成第三季度生产任务，为国家多生产了二十多万吨原煤，和去年同期比较，产煤量增加了百分之二十一以上。
    由于全国国营煤矿广泛展开了增产节约运动，生产成本逐渐下降。仅七、八两个月就比国家计划降低了三百五十多万元。其中抚顺、阜新、蛟河、北票、大同、阳泉、贾汪、淄博等煤矿成绩比较显著。阜新煤矿在八月一个月中降低成本一百二十多万元。不少单位在节约原材料方面也有新的收获。开滦煤矿积极改善操作方法，提高了坑木回收率和复用率，并积极使用钢筋混凝土坑道支架，扭转了过去坑木经常超支的情况。
    新华社八日讯　全国原盐产量到九月中旬止，已完成全年计划百分之一百点六，比去年产量增加百分之二十六点八七，比历史最高年产量（一九五二年）增加百分之二十点五九；其中，长芦、辽宁、淮北、山东四大海盐区不仅完成了全年计划，并且超额百分之二十点四六完成增产计划。这四大海盐区的盐工们已决定在完成全年计划和增产计划之外，今年再为国家增产原盐三十万吨，并努力提高原盐质量。
    今年原盐大量增产，不仅保证了全国食盐供应及工、农、渔业用盐和出口盐的需要，并为国家积累了大量建设资金。
    今年原盐增产的原因，除了自然条件较好，雨季降雨量一般比往年为低以外，主要是广大职工积极响应增产节约的号召，贯彻和执行了“防汛结合生产”的方针，在雨汛季节一般都在做好防台、防汛、防洪工作的同时，抓紧有利天时，积极修滩、养卤、保卤和产盐。
