    Many Valuable Equipment Buried in the Ground
    To the Editor:
    In early August, we started working at the Datong Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau and found that the equipment management at the Meiyukou Mine construction site was severely lacking responsibility. Many valuable equipment were buried in the ground and severely damaged. What we saw alone included two boiler air chambers east of the winch room, a boiler, two coal cars, scaffolding poles, and a stack of red pine logs east of the square transport road. The earthwork project at this construction site is under intense construction, and sand and soil continue to be dumped on the ground. The equipment that has not been moved will soon be completely buried by the earthwork.
    In addition, when the paving project east of the winch room had just excavated the topsoil, a section of steel rail was exposed; a portion of steel pipe ends of varying lengths were also buried in the nearby shallow soil. Someone asked if these things should be taken out; however, a person in charge of the construction site replied: "These were buried here before." The implication was "I didn't bury them, so I can't be responsible."
    The Meiyukou project involves opening mountains and filling mountain gullies to create an industrial square, and the amount of earthwork is very large. If this situation continues to develop, it will cause a great waste and should be inspected and corrected.

### 许多贵重器材被埋在土里

    许多贵重器材被埋在土里编辑同志：
    八月初我们到大同煤矿基本建设局工作，发现煤峪口矿井工地器材管理无人负责的现象十分严重。很多贵重器材埋在土里，受到严重的损坏。仅我们看到的，绞车房东面有锅炉气包两个，广场运输道东边有锅炉一台、煤车两辆、脚手杆和红松原木一垛。这个工地的土方工程正在紧张施工，沙土继续不断地往地面上倒，没有挪走的器材很快就要完全被土方掩没了。
    此外，绞车房东面铺轨工程刚掘开表土时就露出一段钢轨；附近浅土里还埋有不同长度的一部分钢管头。有人问是否要把这些东西往外拿；可是工地一个负责施工的人员回答：“这是以前埋到里边的。”意思就是“不是我埋的，我可以不管”。
    煤峪口工程是以开山填平山沟来作工业广场的，土方工程量很大，照这种情况发展下去，将会造成很大的浪费，应该进行检查和纠正。
