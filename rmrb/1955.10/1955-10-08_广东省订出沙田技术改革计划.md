Guangdong Province formulates technical reform plan for Shatian

    In the Shatian area of the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong Province, early rice, which was changed from double-cropping intercropping to double-cropping continuous cropping, has generally achieved increased production despite suffering from severe alkali tides, insect pests, and other attacks. This year, the 580,000 mu of early rice converted to double-cropping continuous cropping is estimated to increase production by 60 million jin of rice, an average increase of about 100 jin per mu compared to the original double-cropping intercropping.

    This year, more than 700,000 mu of Shatian area has been changed from double-cropping intercropping to double-cropping continuous cropping, accounting for a quarter of the Shatian area, an increase of more than 580,000 mu compared to 1954. In order to further transform Shatian and increase grain production, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China plans to basically eliminate double-cropping intercropping rice in Shatian within three years and has formulated a draft plan for technical reform of Shatian next year. According to this plan, in the upper Shatian area of the Pearl River Delta, the area converted to double-cropping continuous cropping next year will be expanded by more than 600,000 mu compared to this year.

    广东省订出沙田技术改革计划
    广东省珠江三角洲沙田地区由双季间作改为双季连作的早稻，虽遭受了严重的碱潮、虫害等袭击，仍普遍获得增产。今年改为双季连作的五十八万多亩早稻，估计可增产六千万斤稻谷，平均每亩比原来的双季间作增产一百斤左右。
    今年沙田地区由双季间作改为双季连作的有七十多万亩，占沙田面积的四分之一，比一九五四年扩大五十八万多亩。为了进一步改造沙田，增产粮食，中共广东省委计划在三年内基本消灭沙田双季间作稻，并订出了明年沙田技术改革计划草案。根据这个计划，珠江三角洲上沙田地区，明年改为双季连作的将比今年扩大六十多万亩。
