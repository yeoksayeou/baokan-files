Xinhua News Agency report: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Defense Ministers' meeting in Paris concluded on the 12th after three days of sessions. The final communique stated that several heads of NATO military institutions reported to the meeting on NATO's current strategic situation and military arrangements. The communique also stated that the main purpose of the meeting was to exchange information.

The meeting was held in secret. However, according to newspaper reports, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, U.S. General Gruenther, in his speech on the 11th, advocated against slowing down the pace of arms expansion. He said that NATO forces are still behind schedule "in both quantity and quality" and that "what is urgently needed now is to strengthen, not reduce, defense efforts." Gruenther also demanded the unification of NATO air force command and an increase in airfields. Gruenther believes that France's withdrawal of troops from Europe to North Africa has a "negative impact" on NATO because it weakens the strength of NATO forces.

A United States Information Service dispatch from Paris said: Military commanders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "expressed a deep concern that the 'Geneva spirit' would overwhelm the parliaments of the allied countries, causing them to dismantle or reduce their strength."

A NATO spokesman said on the 12th that the Paris meeting had decided to maintain the Western allies' so-called "defense efforts."

Many Parisian newspaper commentators, commenting on the Paris meeting, believe that the nature of this meeting is clearly contrary to the spirit of easing tensions and strengthening mutual trust in current international relations.

    北大西洋集团各国国防部长开会
    格仑瑟叫嚣加强军事力量
    据新华社讯　在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团国防部长会议举行了三天会议后，在十二日闭幕。会议发表的最后公报说，北大西洋集团军事机构的一些负责人向会议就北大西洋集团现在的战略局势和军事安排作了报告。公报还说：这次会议主要的是为了交换情报。
    会议是秘密举行的。但据报纸报道，北大西洋集团军总司令美国将军格仑瑟在十一日的发言中，鼓吹不能放慢扩军步骤。他说，北大西洋集团的部队“在数量和质量上”仍然落后于原订计划，“目前迫切需要的是加强，而不是减少防务努力。”格仑瑟还要求统一北大西洋集团空军的指挥和增加机场。格仑瑟认为法国从欧洲抽调军队到北非去对北大西洋集团有“不利影响”，因为这削弱了北大西洋部队的实力。
    美国新闻处从巴黎发出的消息说：北大西洋公约组织的军事司令官“表示出一种深切的担心，担心‘日内瓦精神’会压倒联盟各国的议会，使它们拆除或削减实力”。
    北大西洋集团发言人十二日发表谈话说，巴黎会议已经决定要保持西方盟国的所谓“防务努力”。
    巴黎许多报纸的评论员在评论这次巴黎会议时认为，这个会议的性质是显然违反国际关系中现有的缓和紧张局势和加强互相信任的精神的。
