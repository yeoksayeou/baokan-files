Hubei's total grain output this year is expected to exceed the plan by 5.6 percent, an increase of 1 billion jin compared to 1953 before the major flood, after suffering from a major flood last year.

During the difficult days following the major flood in Hubei Province, the Communist Party and the People's Government sent a large number of excellent cadres to the disaster areas to share weal and woe with the farmers, leading them to rebuild their homes and restore production. The state successively distributed a total of 100.9 million yuan in relief funds, compensation, and various production loans, and also transported large amounts of grain and materials for building houses. Farmers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Henan, Heilongjiang and other provinces, as well as farmers in non-disaster areas of Hubei, also sent large quantities of seeds, fertilizers, and more than 50,000 head of draft animals. Farmers in the disaster areas, following the path pointed out by the Communist Party, actively organized themselves, overcame difficulties, and launched a vigorous production self-rescue movement. The number of agricultural production cooperatives in the province quickly increased from more than 1,000 in the past to more than 14,000; the number of farming households participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations rose from 50 percent of the total number of farming households in the province to about 60 percent. Farmers in the main grain-producing areas along the Yangtze and Han Rivers and in the lake areas, relying on the strength of organization, quickly reinforced and repaired the thousands of miles of dikes that had been washed away by the flood, drained the accumulated water from the fields more than 20 days ahead of schedule, planted crops in a timely manner, and actively repaired and built farmland water conservancy projects, enabling more than 3.4 million mu of farmland to be protected from or have reduced the threat of water and drought. In addition, mutual aid and cooperation organizations in various places, under the guidance of state-owned farms and agricultural technology promotion stations, led farmers to promote more than 10 million mu of improved varieties of rice, wheat, and other crops, implemented artificial and mechanical pest control in areas prone to pests and diseases, and promoted advanced cultivation techniques in double-cropping areas of cotton and wheat and rice and wheat, ensuring the increase of yield per unit area.

    湖北粮食总产量可超过计划百分之五点六
    去年遭受大水后的湖北省，今年粮食总产量预计可以超过计划百分之五点六，比大水前的一九五三年增产十亿斤。
    在湖北省大水过后百事困难的日子里，共产党和人民政府派出大批优秀的干部到灾区，和农民同甘苦，共患难，领导农民重整家园，恢复生产。国家先后发放救济金、补偿款和各种生产贷款共一亿零九千多元，还运来大量粮食和修盖房屋的器材。江苏、浙江、江西、湖南、河南、黑龙江等省和本省非灾区的农民也送来大批种籽、肥料和五万多头耕畜。灾区农民依照共产党指出的道路，积极组织起来，克服困难，开展了轰轰烈烈的生产自救运动。全省农业生产合作社很快由过去的一千多个发展到一万四千多个；参加互助合作组织的农户由过去占全省农户总数的百分之五十上升到百分之六十左右。主要粮食产区长江、汉水两岸和滨湖地区的农民，依靠组织起来的力量，迅速加固和培修了被大水冲垮的千里堤防，比预定计划提早二十多天把田里的积水排出，及时种下庄稼，并积极整修和兴修农田水利工程，使三百四十多万亩农田免除和减轻了水、旱的威胁。此外，各地互助合作组织还在国营农场和农业技术推广站指导下，带动农民推广水稻、小麦等优良品种一千多万亩，在容易发生病虫害地区实行人工和药械防治，在棉麦、稻麦两熟地区推行先进耕作技术，保证了单位面积产量的提高。（新华社）
