    Welcome the Soviet "Zenit" Football Team
    Li Menghua, Director of the Sports Competition Department of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China

    The Soviet Leningrad "Zenit" Voluntary Sports Association football team, invited to visit our country, has arrived in Beijing in batches under the leadership of team leader V.S. Deromanov. In addition to playing matches with various football teams in our country in Beijing, the team will also visit Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai and other places. The Chinese people, our sports workers, and athletes extend a warm welcome to the visiting Soviet Leningrad "Zenit" football team.

    Football is one of the most popular mass sports in the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, whether in cities and villages, factories and collective farms, football fields and people practicing football can be seen everywhere. And the technical level of Soviet football is extremely high. This year, Soviet football teams have achieved brilliant results in matches against many foreign football teams. The Soviet team defeated the Swedish team with a score of six to zero. Subsequently, Moscow's "Dynamo" team defeated the Italian champion "Milan" team with a score of three to zero. In August of this year, Moscow's "Spartak" and "Dynamo" teams defeated the internationally famous British professional football team "Wolverhampton Wanderers" with scores of three to zero and three to two respectively. Following this, on August 21, the Soviet mixed football team defeated the 1954 World Cup champion, the Federal Republic of Germany's mixed football team, with a score of three to two.

    The Leningrad "Zenit" football team, which is visiting our country this time, is also one of the famous football teams in the Soviet Union. It is the representative team of the "Zenit" Voluntary Sports Association, which is composed of sports organizations from enterprises, institutions, and schools in the Leningrad machinery manufacturing system. The "Zenit" football team has participated in the All-Union "A" League football championship since 1938 and has consistently achieved excellent rankings. Since 1944, the "Zenit" football team has participated in a total of twenty international matches, defeating city representative teams and sports association representative teams from countries such as Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, East Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. Among the eighteen players visiting our country, goalkeeper Leonid Ivanov, midfielder Viktor Karpov, and forward Fridkinch Malyukin have all been awarded the title of Honored Master of Sports of the Soviet Union. In addition, there are also seven Soviet sports masters and six Soviet first-class football players. This is a football team with a high level of technical skill and rich international competition experience.

    In recent years, mass sports in our country have developed rapidly, and the technical level has also improved. A very important factor in this is the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to us, as well as our learning of the Soviet Union's advanced theories and experiences in developing mass sports and improving the level of sports technology. Since 1950, the Soviet Union has successively sent outstanding athletes from basketball, gymnastics, track and field, swimming, and skating teams to visit, perform, and compete in our country. Our sports teams and athletes have also visited the Soviet Union more than once. In these frequent exchanges, our sports teams and athletes have benefited greatly, not only improving their technical level but also cultivating a communist moral style.

    The visit and matches of the Soviet Leningrad "Zenit" football team will have an important impact on further developing sports in our country, especially football, and improving the technical level of football in our country.

    For our athletes, especially football players, this is a very rare opportunity. We should sincerely and earnestly learn the superior techniques and rich experience of the Soviet Leningrad "Zenit" football team.

    欢迎苏联“泽尼特”足球队
    中华人民共和国体育运动委员会运动竞赛司司长　李梦华
    应邀来我国访问的苏联列宁格勒“泽尼特”志愿体育协会足球队在领队维·斯·杰洛曼诺夫率领下已分批到达北京。该队除在北京同我国各足球代表队进行比赛以外，并将赴天津、沈阳、上海等地访问。我国人民、我国体育工作者和运动员，对苏联列宁格勒“泽尼特”足球队的来访，表示热烈的欢迎。
    苏联的足球运动是最受人欢迎的群众性的运动项目之一。在苏联，无论是城市和乡村，工厂和集体农庄，到处都可以看到足球场地和练习足球运动的人们。而苏联足球运动的技术水平，是极高的。在今年，苏联的足球队在同许多外国足球队进行的比赛中，获得了辉煌的战绩。苏联代表队以六比零的战绩战胜了瑞典代表队。嗣后，莫斯科的“狄纳莫”队以三比零胜意大利的冠军“米兰”队。在今年八月间，莫斯科的“斯巴达”和“狄纳莫”两队，分别以三比零和三比二战胜国际上著名的英国职业足球队“武尔弗哈姆普吞流浪者”。接着，苏联混合足球队在八月二十一日又以三比二击败了一九五四年世界足球锦标赛的冠军德意志联邦共和国的混合足球队。
    这次来我国访问的列宁格勒“泽尼特”足球队，也是苏联著名的足球队之一。它是列宁格勒机器制造业系统的企业、机关和学校的体育团体所组成的“泽尼特”志愿体育协会的代表队。“泽尼特”足球队，从一九三八年开始就参加全苏“甲”组的足球冠军赛，并连续获得优良的名次。从一九四四年起，“泽尼特”足球队共参加过二十场国际比赛，战胜过芬兰、瑞典、挪威、丹麦、民主德国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克等国家的城市代表队和体育协会的代表队。来我国访问的十八名队员中，守门员列昂尼德·伊凡诺夫、前卫维克多·卡尔波夫、前锋弗里德金赫·马柳金都获得苏联功勋运动员的称号。此外，还有七名苏联运动健将和六名苏联一级足球运动员。这是一个具有高度技术水平和丰富的国际比赛经验的足球队。
    近几年来，我国群众性的体育运动有了迅速的发展，技术水平也有了提高，其所以如此，一个十分重要的因素，是苏联对我们的无私的帮助，以及我们学习了苏联开展群众性体育运动和提高运动技术水平的先进理论和经验。从一九五○年以来，苏联曾先后派遣了篮球队、体操队、田径队、游泳队、滑冰队等优秀运动员来我国访问、表演和比赛。我国运动队和运动员也不止一次地去苏联访问。在这些频繁的交往过程中，我国运动队和运动员得到了很大的教益，不仅改进和提高了技术水平，而且培养了共产主义的道德作风。
    苏联列宁格勒“泽尼特”足球队的来访和比赛，对进一步开展我国体育运动，特别是足球运动和提高我国足球运动的技术水平，将会有重要的影响。
    对于我国运动员，特别是足球运动员来说，这是一次十分难得的机会，我们应该十分诚恳、认真地学习苏联列宁格勒“泽尼特”足球队的优越的技术和丰富的经验。
