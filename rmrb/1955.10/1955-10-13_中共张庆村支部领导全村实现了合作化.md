The Party branch of Zhangqing Village in Yuci County led the village's farmers to basically realize cooperation in a year and a half. Of the 516 households in the village, except for landlords, rich peasants, and some wealthy peasants who were temporarily unwilling to join the cooperative, the remaining 482 households all participated in agricultural cooperatives.

The Zhangqing Village Party branch was not adequately prepared for the high tide of farmers actively joining the cooperative. Before the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, there were only twelve party members; however, in the face of the cooperative movement, they did not stand idly by and lag behind the masses, nor did they use excessive conditions to restrict and frustrate the farmers' socialist enthusiasm. Although the movement encountered many difficulties and twists and turns, the Party branch overcame them one by one.

    **Persisting in Running Agricultural Cooperatives**

In the spring of 1953, Zhangqing Village transformed three mutual aid teams into an agricultural production cooperative of 30 households. Shortly after its establishment, when the members were actively engaged in production, the county party committee, fearing that the cooperative would not be successful, wanted them to disband. At this time, the members expressed their determination to continue running it, with some saying, "Even if the higher authorities don't care, we will still run it, we are not doing anything bad." The party members also deeply felt from their own experiences that the members' joining the cooperative was genuinely voluntary. For example, Zhang Yuan'er, the party branch secretary, had been single all his life, running around and struggling, and although he had accumulated some property after the land reform, his life was still very difficult, and he was determined to run the cooperative. Party member Li Sanmao was also a poor peasant who joined a mutual aid team in 1952 and received an additional eight shi of grain, and he also supported the party's cooperative policy. Party member Han Quanwa and his two brothers were all hired laborers in the past and were now very happy to be involved in the cooperative. Based on these analyses, the branch made a firm guarantee to the county party committee: "We will definitely run the cooperative well, and we will definitely increase production." The county party committee then allowed them to continue running it.

However, the branch really did not have a good way to lead. Initially, the party members only knew how to take the lead and encourage the members to work actively. While farmers outside the cooperative went to the city to haul fertilizer once a day, they went twice a day, starting early and working late. While farmers outside the cooperative applied an average of 30 dan of fertilizer per mu of land, the agricultural cooperative applied an average of 60 dan per mu. During sowing, they planted sorghum in low-lying areas and corn and millet in good land. By focusing on these two aspects alone, their seedlings were better than others.

Despite the good growth of the seedlings, many problems still arose during the production process. Households with livestock were unwilling to have their animals appraised for cooperative membership, causing resentment. Some members had disputes over scoring work points, refusing to speak to each other. Li Yinghu watched the livestock all day without working, constantly cursing the party cadres, saying, "I brought livestock into the cooperative, and you don't even have a donkey hair, you're taking my labor days to support your families." Capitalist forces outside the cooperative seized the opportunity to attack. Some people said, "If agricultural cooperatives can be run well, I'll walk upside down." "Agricultural cooperatives mean livestock die quickly, cadres age quickly, and furniture breaks quickly." As village chief Yang Liye walked in front, someone sarcastically said from behind, "Look at the person walking the socialist road." When the cooperative repaired a pigsty and picked up some broken bricks, people outside the cooperative reported to the county, saying they were seizing public property. Landlord Li Ying'er also took the opportunity to sabotage, trying to pull member Hou You'er out of the cooperative. Under these circumstances, the branch did feel some difficulties, but they did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties, and with the help of the county party committee and resident staff, they actively continued to run the cooperative. They made self-criticisms for some hasty emotions, changed the appraisal of livestock for cooperative membership to renting and hiring, implemented small-scale contracting for labor management, and led members to study the pamphlet "Where is Society Going," strengthening the members' thinking. At the same time, they exposed and criticized incorrect statements outside the cooperative. From then on, the members' enthusiasm for labor increased again.

After a year of hard work, there were experiences, lessons, and still some problems. But because of increased production, the agricultural cooperative was still consolidated. That autumn, the average yield of autumn grain was 428 jin per mu, 86 jin higher than the mutual aid teams, and 90 jin higher than the average yield of the entire village. Regardless of whether there were many or few laborers, much or little land, every household had more income than the previous year, and it was named a provincial model unit for high yield. The Party branch achieved its first victory in leading the cooperative movement in the entire village.

    **Selecting Backbone Members for Running the Cooperative from Among the Masses**

In the spring of 1954, the farmers throughout the village were universally educated about the general line, their socialist consciousness was greatly improved, and the agricultural cooperative set an example for the farmers of the whole village, with more than 240 households actively signing up to join the cooperative. While the masses were very enthusiastic, some party members advocated "contraction." They said, "Leading a small cooperative of 30 households last year was already very difficult, if it is expanded to more than 200 households, it will be even more impossible to lead. The material for making a small bowl cannot be used to make a large vat." They also worried about where the staff would come from. Even if all the 30 old members of the cooperative were made cadres, it would not be enough! Therefore, they only advocated running a cooperative of 50 households. But later, even adding it to 80 households or 100 households was not enough, and many farmers repeatedly asked staff members to intercede, requesting to join the cooperative. In this situation where it was difficult to refuse the enthusiasm of the masses, the branch decided to first conduct a review of the farmers requesting to join the cooperative based on their thoughts and class background, deciding how large to make the cooperative based on how many were reviewed. After a household-by-household review, it was found that 187 households were genuinely voluntary, with poor peasants accounting for 60%, and it was decided to first absorb this group of people into the cooperative. After the branch determined the size of the cooperative, it looked for staff throughout the village. Nine people were promoted from old cooperative members and mutual aid team leaders, such as Zhang Heixiao, who was originally the production team leader of the old cooperative, and was promoted to production captain, and Zhou Manxiao, who was originally the mutual aid team leader, and was also promoted to production captain after joining the cooperative; seven party members and seven administrative staff were also selected to serve as cooperative staff; and Jiao Fuxing, who had led the land reform and had high prestige among the masses, was appointed as the first cooperative director, and Yang Liye, who was thrifty, hardworking, and fair, was appointed as the second cooperative director. After the branch equipped the staff, it took the list to the members for deliberation and discussion. The branch's opinion coincided with the members' wishes, and everyone reflected that "With these people leading, we can be more assured."

    **Handling Problems According to the Party's Policies**

After the cooperative expanded, there were many households, and the branch encountered new difficulties in leading and handling specific issues. There were often differences of opinion between old and new members, and between middle and poor peasant members, and they often argued at meetings, unable to reach a conclusion. The middle peasants demanded that everything be equal, while the poor peasants believed that they were making something from nothing and should not be in debt. When appraising property, the middle peasants wanted it determined according to the expected yield, while the poor peasants wanted it determined according to the actual yield. The old members said that their land had been improved and should be universally increased by 10%, and the rental prices for livestock and farm tools could not be determined. At this time, the branch adhered to one idea: to study the party's policies well, and to combine ideological mobilization with the handling of specific issues. Then, they led all the members to study the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives," studied the cooperative's charter, explained the direction of rural development and the principle of common prosperity, and used real-life examples as metaphors. After this study, the members' thinking improved, and the problems were handled more smoothly, and the branch itself felt that they had a way to proceed. After completing the "Four Appraisals" work, the branch led everyone to implement "Three Fixes and Contracting," using methods such as seizing red flags and conducting competitions to encourage the members' labor enthusiasm. Although 1954 was a year of floods and poor harvests, this large cooperative in Zhangqing Village had a bumper harvest, with an average yield of 369 jin per mu, 25 jin higher than the average yield of 344 jin for the entire village, once again reaching the provincial model standard for high yield.

In June 1954, the state was to establish a tractor station in Zhangqing Village. This news immediately spread throughout the village. Some held mutual aid team meetings, some held family meetings, all discussing the issue of joining the cooperative. Farmers who were originally wavering made their final determination to join the cooperative. The sabotage activities of landlords and rich peasant elements also became more intense, as they put on an active facade to sign up to join the cooperative while secretly trying to resist the movement, spreading rumors and creating incidents, saying things like "If the land is connected, there will be no dividends," "Our village has watery land and is not suitable for tractors, machines plow deep and turn up raw soil that can't hold seedlings," and so on. Not all staff members clearly recognized this sharp struggle situation. When reviewing cooperative members, some cooperative staff members advocated first absorbing wealthy households into the cooperative, reasoning that "Wealthy households have a thicker foundation, and there are more burdens in the cooperative, and these people can support the poor peasants when they join the cooperative." The Party branch led the cooperative staff members in discussions, presenting the various performances of different people in the expansion of the cooperative to allow everyone to recognize them. In this way, everyone realized that it was necessary to effectively implement the party's class line in the current rural work and to prevent the sabotage activities of landlords and rich peasant elements. After the cooperative staff members unified their thinking, they announced that they would not absorb landlords and rich peasants into the cooperative, and also announced that eight wealthy households, including Zhang Cunhai, whose thinking was not firm, would not be absorbed for the time being. After doing this, the conspiracy of the rich peasants failed, and the class consciousness of the party members, staff members, and the broad masses was further improved in the actual struggle.

    **Actively and Prudently Develop Party Organizations**

The development speed of agricultural cooperatives was very fast, and the quality of party members was also improved from actual struggles, but the number of party members still seemed very small, and some production teams did not even have a single party member. This objective situation made the branch pay attention to the development of party work. Last year alone, this branch absorbed ten new party members. These party members were all trained, tested, and cultivated from the actual struggles of establishing and expanding the cooperative. In the process of training and education, the branch selected outstanding cooperative members with good class backgrounds, clear histories, fairness in the cooperative, courage to fight against bad tendencies, and active labor as training objects, determined branch committee members to provide individual assistance, and conducted ideological appraisals at the end of each production season and political movement. The ten new party members developed by this branch all met the requirements of the party for absorbing new party members. For example, new party members Zhang Quangen and Han Wantao are active in struggle, firm in their positions, and fair in their work, and have been elected as deputy directors from ordinary cooperative members. New party members Zhou Tieju and Yin Genliang took the lead in digging canals and going into the water, sacrificing themselves for the cooperative, and were praised by the members.

After the basic cooperation of the entire village, counter-revolutionary elements did not give up their sabotage of agricultural cooperatives, but their activities became more cunning and hidden. This spring, due to the shortcomings of the unified purchase last year in this village, which were biased towards the old cooperative members, allowing them to sell more grain, and the problem of equal distribution during the autumn harvest, and because there was a lot of rain and wet ground last autumn, the soil clods in the land ploughed by machines were very large, so the members once called for a shortage of grain, their enthusiasm for labor was negative, and they also had doubts about the benefits of machine cultivation. This gap was seized by counter-revolutionary elements to alienate the relationship between the party and the masses, and they provoked by saying, "The surrounding villages don't have large cooperatives, only our village has large cooperatives; the villages without cooperatives have light unified purchases, and the villages with cooperatives have heavy unified purchases, all of which is due to the pests Jiao Fuxing and Yang Liye (party members and cooperative directors) in our village." They also spread rumors among the masses such as "Tractors and disc harrows plow soil clods as big as human heads." Under this situation, the Party branch maintained a clear head, educating the masses and verifying the grain supply on the one hand, and investigating the activities of counter-revolutionary elements and educating the masses to identify bad elements on the other. After the masses' awareness was further raised, counter-revolutionary elements such as Wu Zhongxi could no longer hide, and were arrested and brought to justice by the government. This effectively struck a blow against the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements, and the vigilance of the party and the masses was further improved, and the experience in the struggle against the enemy was more enriched.

This summer's harvest, the wheat in the cooperative was the first harvest after using machine cultivation. The average yield of machine-cultivated wheat was 340 jin per mu, the highest was 480 jin, and the average yield of all wheat was 252 jin per mu, more than 60 jin higher than the 190 jin per mu in the old cooperative last year. After completing the state's unified purchase task, each person retained 100 jin of wheat, plus 130 jin of peas and barley, and there were no grain-deficient households in the entire cooperative. The more than 20 old, weak, orphaned, and widowed households that needed state relief every year also had enough rations. The members said that this year there were three satisfactions: "Satisfaction with increased production from machine cultivation, satisfaction with the 'Three Fixes' policy, and satisfaction with income distribution." The members' thinking in the cooperative was more steadfast.

The party organization in Zhangqing Village has improved and developed through leading the cooperative movement, but the quality and quantity of party members cannot yet meet the needs of the work. The party's serious task of socialist transformation of agriculture requires the Zhangqing Village Party branch to continuously improve its combat effectiveness in the struggle to consolidate agricultural cooperatives.

    中共张庆村支部领导全村实现了合作化
    邓峰
    榆次县张庆村的党支部以一年半的时间领导全村农民基本上实现了合作化。全村五百一十六户，除地主、富农和一些暂时尚不愿入社的富裕农民外，其余四百八十二户农民都参加了农业合作社。
    张庆村党支部原来对农民积极入社的高潮是没有足够准备的。建立农业合作社以前，只有十二名党员；但在合作化运动面前，他们并没有束手束足落在群众的后面，没有用过多的条件去限制和挫折农民的社会主义积极性。运动虽遇到不少困难和曲折，可是党支部都一一把它克服了。
    坚持把农业合作社办下去
    一九五三年春天，张庆村就由三个互助组合办成了一个三十户的农业生产合作社。建社不久，社员们正在积极生产的时候，县委恐怕办不好社，要他们转组。这时，社员们表示一定要办下去，有的社员说：“上级不管也要办，咱们又不是办坏事。”党员们从自己体会中也深深感到社员们入社是真正出于自愿。像支部书记张元儿一辈子单身东奔西走，土地改革后虽然有了点家业，但生活困难还很多，是坚决愿意办社的。党员李三毛也是贫农，一九五二年参加了互助组，就多分了八石粮食，他同样拥护党的合作化政策。党员韩全娃弟兄三个过去都是当雇工，眼下也很乐意搞社。根据这些分析，支部向县委提出坚决保证：“一定把社办好，一定增产。”县委就允许他们办下去了。
    可是，支部确实也没有个好的领导办法。开始，党员们只知带头和鼓舞社员积极劳动。社外农民进城拉肥一天一次，他们起早搭黑一天两次。社外农民每亩地平均施肥三十担，农业社每亩地平均施到六十担。播种时他们把高粱都种到低凹地，玉茭、谷子种到好地里。只抓了这么两条，秋苗子就比别人的好。
    尽管苗子长得好，但在生产过程中仍然发生了不少问题。有牲畜的户不愿牲口作价入社，闹情绪。有些社员间为评分记工发生纠纷，互相不说话。李英虎天天看着牲口不劳动，整天谩骂党员干部说：“我拉牲口进社，你们连根驴毛也没，把我的劳动日给你们拿去养活家口吧。”社外资本主义势力就趁机进攻。有人说：“农业合作社要能办好，我头朝地走路。”“农业合作社是牲口死的快，干部老的快，家具坏的快。”村长杨立业在前面走，后面就有人讽刺说：“看人家走社会主义道路的人。”社里修猪圈拾了些烂砖头，社外人就往县里报告，说他们抢用公产。地主李英儿也趁机进行破坏，拉拢社员侯有儿出社。在这种情况下，支部确实感到有些困难，但他们没有在困难面前低头，还是在县委派来的工作人员和驻社工作人员的帮助下积极把社办下去。对于某些急躁情绪，他们作了检讨，并把牲口作价入社改为租用和雇用，劳动管理上也实行了小包工，还领导社员学了“社会往那里走”的小册子，坚定了社员的思想。同时，在社外揭露和批判了不正确的言论。从此社员的劳动劲头又高起来了。
    经过一年的忙碌，也有经验，也有教训，也还有一些问题。但由于增了产，农业合作社还是巩固的。当年秋粮每亩平均四百二十八斤，比互助组高八十六斤，比全村平均产量高九十斤。不管劳力多的或土地多的，劳力少或土地少的，家家户户比上年收入都多，被评为省的丰产模范单位。党支部在领导全村合作化的运动中取得了第一次胜利。
    从群众中选拔办社骨干
    一九五四年春季，全村农民普遍受到了总路线的教育，社会主义觉悟大大提高，农业合作社又给全村农民做出了榜样，全村有二百四十多户农民积极报名入社。正在群众热情很高的时候，有些党员却主张“紧缩”。他们说：“去年领导三十户的小社还吃了大力，要是扩大到二百多户更无法领导。捏小碗的材料要来捏大瓮恐怕捏不成。”他们还耽心工作人员从哪里来呢？把三十户老社员都让当了干部也不够呀！因此，只主张办个五十户的社。可是后来加到八十户、一百户还是不行，有许多农民托工作人员三番五次说情，要求入社。在这种群众热情难却的情况下，支部决定先根据要求入社农民的思想和成分进行站队审查，审查下多少办多大。经过逐户审查，结果有一百八十七户是思想真正自愿，其中贫农占百分之六十，就确定先吸收这批人入社。支部确定了社的大小后，就在全村找工作人员。从老社员和互助组组长中提拔了九个，像张黑小原是老社生产组长，提成生产队长，周蛮小原是互助组长，入社后也提成生产队长；又抽出七个党员、七个行政工作人员担任社工作人员；并把领导过土地改革、在群众中威信较高的焦福星确定为第一社长，把勤俭刻苦、为人公道的杨立业确定为第二社长。支部把工作人员配备好以后，把名单带到社员中酝酿讨论。支部的意见正合社员心意，大家反映说：“有这些人领导，更放心啦。”
    按照党的政策来处理问题
    社扩大了，户数很多，支部在领导处理具体问题时遇到了新的困难。老社员和新社员、中农社员和贫农社员之间，意见常有分歧，时常开会争吵得下不了台。中农要求十个指头一般齐，贫农认为自己是干骨头上长肉不负债就算。评产时，中农要按应产量定，贫农要按实产量定，老社员说他们的土地加了工要普遍提一成，还有牲口租价、农具租价也定不下来。这时，支部就抱定一个主意：好好学习党的政策，把思想发动同处理具体问题结合起来。接着就领导全体社员学习了中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议，学习了社章，讲解了农村发展的方向和大家富裕的道理，并联系活人活事作比喻。经过这样学习，社员思想提高了，问题处理也顺手了，支部本身也感到有了办法。搞完“四评”工作以后，支部又领导大家实行了“三定包工”，运用了夺红旗、搞竞赛的方法，来鼓动社员的劳动情绪。一九五四年虽然雨涝歉收，但张庆村这个大社却丰收了，每亩平均产量三百六十九斤，比全村平均产量三百四十四斤高二十五斤，又一次达到省的丰产模范标准。
    一九五四年的六月，国家要在张庆村建立拖拉机站。这个风声，立刻传遍了全村。有的开互助组会，有的开家庭会，都在商量入社的问题。原来动摇不定的农民也下了最后的决心要入社。地主、富农分子的破坏活动也更加厉害起来，他们一面装上积极面孔报名入社；一面背地里想办法对抗运动，造谣生事，说什么“土地连了片就不分红了”，“咱村是水地不宜用拖拉机，机器耕的深、翻出生土来扎不住苗”等等。这种尖锐的斗争形势并不是所有工作人员都认识清楚。在审查社员时，一部分社工作人员主张先吸收富裕户入社，道理是：富裕户底垫厚，社内拖累多，这些人进了社，就能扶持了贫农。党支部领导社工作人员展开了讨论，把扩社中各种人的表现摆出来让大家认识。这样，大家认识到，必须切实贯彻党在目前农村工作中的阶级路线，防止地主、富农分子的破坏活动。社工作人员思想统一了，宣布不吸收地主、富农入社，也宣布了张存海等八户思想不坚定的富裕户暂不吸收。这样做以后，富农的阴谋失败了，党员、工作人员和广大群众的阶级觉悟又在实际斗争中提高了一步。积极慎重地发展党的组织
    农业合作社发展的速度很快，党员的质量从实际斗争中也有所提高，但党员的数量却仍然显得很少，有的生产队连一个党员也没有。这一客观形势就使得支部对发展党的工作重视起来。去年一年，这个支部共吸收了新党员十名。这些党员都是从建社、扩社的实际斗争中锻炼、考验和培养出来的。在培养教育的过程中，支部选择成分好、历史清楚、在社内表现公正、敢于同不良倾向斗争、劳动积极的优秀的社员为培养对象，确定支委分工个别帮助，每当生产季节和政治运动末期还进行思想鉴定。这个支部所发展的十个新党员都合乎党吸收新党员的要求。如新党员张全根、韩万桃，斗争积极，立场坚定，办事公道，已由一个普通社员被选为副社长。新党员周铁巨、印根亮二人挖干渠带头下水，舍己为社，受到社员赞扬。
    全村基本合作化后，反革命分子并没有放弃对农业合作社的破坏，而是活动更加巧妙和隐蔽了。今年春天，由于这个村去年的统购中有偏重偏轻的缺点，让老社员多卖了一些粮食，秋收分配时又有平均分配的毛病，又因去年秋天雨多地湿机器耕过的土地土块很大，因而社员一度喊叫缺粮，劳动情绪消极，对机器耕地的好处也发生了怀疑。这个空隙就被反革命分子抓住用来离间党和群众的关系，他们挑拨说：“周围村都没大社，偏偏咱村搞大社；没有社的村统购轻，有社的村统购重，这些都是咱村焦福星、杨立业（党员又是社长）这两个害虫坏了事。”又在群众中散布什么“拖拉机、圆盘耙，耕下的土块人头大”。在这种局势下，党支部保持着清醒的头脑，一面教育群众，核实粮食供应；一面调查反革命活动情况，教育群众识别坏分子。当群众觉悟进一步提高之后，反革命分子武中喜等再隐蔽不住，被政府逮捕法办了。这就有力地打击了反革命分子的破坏活动，党内和群众的警惕性也更加提高，对敌斗争的经验更加丰富了。
    今年夏收，社里的小麦是使用机器耕种后的第一次收获。机耕机种的小麦平均每亩产三百四十斤，最高的四百八十斤，全部小麦亩产二百五十二斤，比去年老社亩产一百九十斤多六十多斤。完成国家统购任务后，每口人留到小麦一百斤，加上豌豆大麦留到一百三十斤，全社没有缺粮户了。年年要国家救济的二十多户老弱孤寡户也有了足够的口粮。社员说今年有三满意：“机耕增产满意，‘三定’政策满意，收益分配满意。”社员在社的思想更加坚定。
    张庆村的党组织，通过领导合作化运动有提高有发展，但目前党员的质量和数量还不能适应工作的需要。党对农业实行社会主义改造的严重任务，要求张庆村的党支部在巩固农业合作社的斗争中，不断地提高自己的战斗力。
