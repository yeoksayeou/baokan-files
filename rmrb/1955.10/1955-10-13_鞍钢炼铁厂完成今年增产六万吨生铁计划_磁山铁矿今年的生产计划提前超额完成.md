Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 12th—All employees of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant not only completed the production plan from January to September by the end of September, but also overfulfilled this year's plan to increase production by 60,000 tons of pig iron. The quality of the increased pig iron is very good, with first-grade iron exceeding the planned target by 2.02 percent.
    In order to realize the production increase plan, the employees of the Anshan Iron Smelting Plant launched labor competitions within the same trades this year. They conscientiously implemented the new operating regulations, and universally promoted advanced experiences such as Soviet steam blast and furnace top regulation, which shortened the smelting time and ensured the completion of the production increase plan. At the same time, the consumption of coke was reduced, saving the country more than 57,000 tons of coke in nine months.
    In the production increase and economy campaign, the employees of the Iron Smelting Plant successively created twelve new records, and advanced units such as No. 6 blast furnace, which had no defective products for nine months, and the youth iron smelting furnace—No. 7 blast furnace, which overfulfilled the plan month by month in a balanced manner, emerged.
    Now, the iron smelters are preparing to propose new goals, and the employees of the youth iron smelting furnace have first revised the production increase plan for their furnace.
    Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 12th—The Cishan Iron Mine, a local state-owned enterprise in Hebei Province, overfulfilled the 1955 national production plan on September 28th. Among them, the mining plan exceeded by 0.77 percent, the output value plan exceeded by 7.48 percent, and the cost was reduced by 31.89 percent.
    This year, the Cishan Iron Mine strengthened planning management and technical management in response to the shortcomings in past production. The employees put forward 257 rationalization proposals related to mining, blasting, and other aspects, which continuously improved production efficiency. In tunneling work, the task of tunneling was completed ahead of schedule due to the application of the Soviet advanced experience—"throwing blasting method." In mining work, two Soviet advanced experiences, "horizontal tunnel medium-sized blasting method" and "shaft intensive blasting method," were also promoted, which improved the mining efficiency month by month. The mining efficiency in August increased by 82.3 percent compared with January. In the production increase and economy movement, the employees promoted systems such as team economic accounting and group material quota coupons, which reduced the consumption of materials such as explosives.

    鞍钢炼铁厂完成今年增产六万吨生铁计划
    磁山铁矿今年的生产计划提前超额完成
    新华社鞍山十二日电　鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂全体职工到九月底除完成一月到九月份的生产计划外，还超额完成了今年增产六万吨生铁的计划。增产的生铁质量很好，一级制钢铁超过计划指标百分之二点零二。
    鞍钢炼铁厂的职工为了实现增产计划，今年展开了同工种的劳动竞赛。他们认真贯彻新的操作规程，普遍地推行了苏联蒸气鼓风和炉顶调剂等先进经验，使熔炼时间缩短，保证了增产计划的完成。同时降低了焦炭的消耗，九个月来已为国家节省焦炭五万七千多吨。
    炼铁厂职工在增产节约竞赛中，先后创造了十二次新纪录，并出现了九个月没有出废品的六号高炉和月月均衡超额完成计划的青年炼铁炉——七号高炉等的先进单位。
    现在，炼铁工人们正在准备提出新的奋斗目标，青年炼铁炉的职工首先修订了本炉的增产计划。
    新华社保定十二日电　河北省地方国营磁山铁矿已在九月二十八日超额完成了一九五五年国家生产计划。其中采矿计划超过百分之零点七七，产值计划超过百分之七点四八，成本降低了百分之三十一点八九。
    磁山铁矿今年针对过去生产中的缺点，加强了计划管理和技术管理。职工们提出了二百五十七件有关采矿、爆破等方面的合理化建议，使生产效率不断提高。在掘进工作中，由于运用了苏联的先进经验——“抛掷爆破法”，提前完成了掘进任务。在采矿工作中，也推行了“横洞中型爆破法”、“竖井密集爆破法”两种苏联先进经验，使采矿效率逐月提高，八月份的采矿效率比一月份提高百分之八十二点三。在增产节约运动中，职工们推行了班组经济核算和小组材料定额券等制度，降低了炸药等材料的消耗量。
