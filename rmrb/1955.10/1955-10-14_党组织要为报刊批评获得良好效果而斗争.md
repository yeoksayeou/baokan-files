Party organizations must strive for good results from newspaper criticism
Shixin

The greater the victories and achievements of the revolutionary struggle and construction led by our Party, and the higher the Party's prestige among the people, the more we need to openly criticize the shortcomings and errors in our work, especially using newspapers, the ideological weapon with the farthest reach and greatest influence, to conduct criticism and self-criticism. More and more Communist Party members recognize the great significance of attracting millions of people through newspapers to supervise our work, and therefore they can, as the Party requires, treat newspaper criticism with a humble and sincere attitude. However, on the other hand, we also see that some people with serious arrogance and bureaucratic work styles often use various excuses to oppose criticism and self-criticism in newspapers; some people, although they do not verbally oppose criticism and self-criticism in newspapers, develop resistant emotions when the newspaper criticism is directed at themselves. The responsibility of Party organizations is to constantly educate Party members, especially those being criticized, to adopt a correct attitude towards newspaper criticism, and to strive for good results from criticism. This educational work should not only generally discuss the importance of criticism and self-criticism, but more importantly, correct the incorrect views of those being criticized regarding newspaper criticism based on their specific ideological situation, dispel any excuses they have for resisting criticism, and take practical measures to urge those being criticized to correct the shortcomings and errors that have been exposed.

Facts have proven that wherever Party organizations attach importance to conducting in-depth and meticulous ideological education work for those being criticized, and earnestly help those being criticized to improve their understanding and correct their attitude towards criticism, newspaper criticism there can produce practical results in promoting work.

On January 19th of this year, after the Henan Daily criticized the Luoyang City Construction Engineering Company for raising construction costs, taking excessive management fees, and seeking high profits in the capitalist management ideology during the contracting of the Xiaoyi Mechanized Brick and Tile Factory expansion project, some leaders of this company adopted an incorrect attitude towards the newspaper's criticism. The Party committee secretary shirked responsibility, believing that the matters were all done administratively and he was unaware of them. Some of the administrative leaders emphasized that Party A also had responsibility, emphasizing that the relationship between Party A and Party B was difficult and basic construction work was not easy to do; some also expressed that writing a self-criticism and receiving a punishment would be enough, and they would never engage in basic construction work again. The Luoyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China criticized the above incorrect attitudes. They first used individual talks and small-scale symposiums to patiently educate the company's leadership staff to recognize their responsibilities in this matter, to recognize the error of viewing the relationship between Party A and Party B as an irreconcilable contradiction, and to recognize the harm of capitalist management ideology to socialist enterprises. Later, they further urged the company's leadership staff to inspect their work, and in conjunction with winter training, promote democracy among the employees and carry out criticism and self-criticism. After the extensive exposure and inspection by the employees, the company's leadership staff more deeply realized the harm of capitalist management ideology, and therefore had a great change in their actual actions. In implementing this year's annual plan, the company's leadership not only attached importance to educating employees on the correct understanding of the relationship between Party A and Party B and opposing capitalist management styles, but also seized the two key aspects of practicing strict economy and improving project quality, and actively contacted Party A to achieve close cooperation. In the past six months, the company's operation and management have indeed improved. This shows that the newspaper's criticism has truly become a driving force for improving the company's work. It is not difficult to imagine that if the Luoyang Municipal Committee had not taken effective measures to help those being criticized establish a sincere attitude towards newspaper criticism, if they had allowed those being criticized to shirk responsibility or pass the test with a mere self-criticism, then this correct criticism would not have achieved practical results in improving the work.

Party organizations' attention to and support for criticism in newspapers that reflects the correct opinions of the masses, and serious criticism and struggle against any behavior of those being criticized that resists or suppresses criticism, can not only help those being criticized recognize their mistakes and improve their work, but also inevitably increase the enthusiasm of the masses and raise their awareness as masters of the country. This can be proved by the handling of a criticism in the "Construction Site Life" newspaper by the Committee of the Seventh Engineering Division of the Central South Construction Engineering Bureau of the Communist Party of China. In mid-January of this year, the 5406 construction site of the original Seventh Engineering Division of the Central South Construction Engineering Bureau overfulfilled its production plan by a large margin. The leaders of the construction site did not report the overfulfilled figures truthfully, but wanted to leave a portion of the overfulfilled figures from the middle ten days of the month to make up for the last ten days of the month, so that the last ten days could also continue to "overfulfill." When this erroneous practice of not taking the national plan seriously was exposed in the "Construction Site Life" newspaper sponsored by the Political Department of the Central South Construction Engineering Bureau, the administrative leaders of the construction site not only did not conduct an in-depth examination ideologically, but instead satirized and suppressed the critic. The Committee of the Seventh Engineering Division of the Central South Construction Engineering Bureau of the Communist Party of China did not tolerate the leaders of the 5406 construction site treating the newspaper's criticism with such an erroneous attitude. They organized an inspection team, led by the Party committee secretary, to inspect the work at the construction site, and gave encouragement and support to the critic. After the inspection, it was clarified that the facts of the criticism were completely correct, and the Party committee responsible comrades then had individual talks with the leaders of the construction site to help them recognize their mistakes, and asked them to conduct an examination in connection with the study of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and make a public self-criticism. Through the handling of this incident, the vast number of employees were educated to realize that the Party supports the masses in carrying out criticism, especially criticism from the bottom up, and that any leading cadres who suppress criticism will be punished, thereby enhancing their sense of responsibility for the cause of the Party and the country. For example, statistician Wu Hegao said: "My previous work attitude was to do whatever the leaders said, regardless of whether it was right or wrong, and I had no political sense of responsibility. Through this criticism, I deeply realized that the Party supports and cherishes criticism that adheres to principles, and any leading cadres who suppress criticism will be punished." In April, he discovered that 20,000 yuan in the plan for family dormitories was for a project that had already been completed, and he promptly raised it and reported it to the higher authorities. It is very clear that it was precisely because the Committee of the Seventh Engineering Division of the Central South Construction Engineering Bureau of the Communist Party of China adopted a warm welcome and firm protection attitude towards the criticism in the newspaper, and carried out a serious struggle against those who resisted criticism, that this criticism published in the "Construction Site Life" newspaper had the effect of mobilizing the vast number of employees to actively participate in guaranteeing and supervising production.

With the deepening implementation of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, many Party organizations are more concerned about carrying out criticism and self-criticism in newspapers, and attach greater importance to educating Party members, especially those being criticized, to adopt a correct attitude towards newspaper criticism, which is very necessary. However, not all Party organizations recognize the serious significance of educating cadres in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and recognize that striving for the practical effect of newspaper criticism is their unavoidable responsibility. The Henan Daily published on November 17, 1954, a manuscript by Comrade Nan Jiahe criticizing the Xiaoma Village Engineering Area of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine for not following construction procedures, resulting in waste. The basic spirit and basic facts of this criticism were correct, only with discrepancies in individual facts (naturally, this is a shortcoming of the newspaper), but it was openly resisted by those being criticized. Shi Rixin, the director of the construction department of the original Hankou Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau (now the Jiaozuo Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau), who was responsible for the project construction, actually considered the critic to be "rebelling" and wanted to "settle accounts" with the critic; Fan Renjie, the Party branch secretary, falsely claimed that the newspaper's criticism was "completely fake news" and was unwilling to make any examination. When the Henan Daily criticized their erroneous attitude towards newspaper criticism again on March 12 of this year, Fan Renjie and others intensified their attacks on the critic, saying that the critic was "individualistic, bureaucratic, and vengeful," while at the same time distorting the truth and insisting that the waste was "saving," demanding that the newspaper publicly apologize and restore their "reputation." This crude behavior of suppressing mass criticism and resisting newspaper criticism obviously has nothing in common with the humble and sincere attitude that a Communist Party member should have towards criticism, and this should be seriously dealt with by the Party organization. However, the original General Branch Committee of the Hankou Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau of the Communist Party of China did not discuss the newspaper's two criticisms at all, did not struggle against Fan Renjie and others' behavior of suppressing criticism and resisting newspaper criticism, and adopted a decadent liberal attitude. Although the Jiaozuo Coal Mine Committee of the Communist Party of China had made some criticisms of Fan Renjie and others' errors, they did not take effective measures to timely correct Fan Renjie and others' errors before the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China inspected this incident. The Party organization's connivance and tolerance of resisting criticism and suppressing criticism is connivance and tolerance of bourgeois individualism, complacency, and bureaucratic style in cadres, and is connivance and tolerance of the shortcomings and errors in our work, which is not in line with the interests of the Party and the country, and is also not beneficial to the cadres who have made mistakes themselves. This is precisely the case. When Fan Renjie and others adopted an erroneous attitude towards the newspaper's first criticism, because the Party organization did not promptly conduct a resolute struggle against their errors, this caused them to adopt a more egregious attitude towards the newspaper's second criticism. At the same time, because they had been resisting the newspaper's correct criticism and rejecting the supervision of the Party and the masses, the waste in the Xiaoma Village Engineering Area under their leadership not only did not improve, but became increasingly serious, and this engineering area even failed to complete the plan every month from January to July of this year. This lesson is worth remembering.

The achievements of the socialist construction and socialist transformation led by our Party are getting greater day by day, which is naturally a very good thing. What is not good is that some Communist Party members in the face of these achievements often easily breed complacency, and therefore cannot see the shortcomings and errors in their work, and cannot see that these shortcomings and errors not only directly adversely affect our socialist cause, but also inevitably give the enemy conditions for carrying out sabotage activities. The recent exposure of the subversive activities of counter-revolutionary elements in various places clearly shows how the enemy is trying every means to find our ideological and work weaknesses, and using loopholes in our work to carry out sabotage. It is precisely in the current situation of the rapid advancement of the revolutionary cause and the increasing sharpness of the class struggle that the Party Central Committee particularly emphasizes the full development of criticism and self-criticism, and emphasizes attracting the people through newspapers to openly criticize the shortcomings and errors in our work, and supervise us to correct the shortcomings and errors, which is of great significance. In order to make criticism and self-criticism in newspapers more fully and healthily carried out, newspaper editorial departments should naturally strive to overcome various obstacles to carrying out criticism and ensure the complete correctness of the criticism; Party organizations at all levels should also constantly and deeply educate Party members, especially those being criticized, to adopt a correct attitude towards newspaper criticism, and strive for good results from newspaper criticism.

    党组织要为报刊批评获得良好效果而斗争
    湜辛
    我们党所领导的革命斗争和建设事业的胜利和成绩越大，党在人民群众中的威信越高，我们就越需要公开地批评我们工作中的缺点和错误，特别是需要运用报刊这种射程最远、影响最大的思想武器来进行批评和自我批评。越来越多的共产党员都认识到通过报刊来吸引千百万群众对我们的工作实行监督的重大意义，因此他们能够像党要求的那样，以谦虚诚恳的态度来对待报刊上的批评。但是另一方面，我们也看到某些有着严重的骄傲情绪和严重的官僚主义作风的人，经常以各种借口来反对在报刊上开展批评和自我批评；有一些人虽然口头上并不反对在报刊上开展批评和自我批评，可是当报刊上的批评是针对自己的时候，便产生了抵触的情绪。党组织的责任，就是要经常地教育党员特别是被批评者对报刊上的批评采取正确的态度，为批评获得良好效果而斗争。这种教育工作不应当只是一般地谈论批评和自我批评的重要性，更重要的是要针对被批评者的具体思想情况来纠正他们对报刊批评的不正确看法，解除他们抗拒批评的任何借口，并采取实际措施来督促被批评者纠正已被揭露出来的缺点和错误。
    事实证明，哪里的党组织重视向被批评者进行深入细致的思想教育工作，切实帮助被批评者提高认识，端正对批评的态度，报刊上的批评在那里就能够产生推动工作的实际作用。
    今年一月十九日，河南日报批评了洛阳市建筑工程公司在承包孝义机制砖瓦厂扩建工程中提高造价、多取管理费用、牟取高额利润的资本主义经营思想以后，这个公司的某些领导人员曾对报纸的批评采取了不正确的态度。党委书记推卸责任，认为事情都是行政上做的，自己不知道。行政领导人员中有的则强调甲方也有责任，强调甲乙双方关系不好处，基本建设工作不好做；有的还表示写个检讨、受个处分算了，今后再也不搞基本建设工作了。中共洛阳市委对上述不正确的态度进行了批评。他们首先采用个别谈话和小型座谈会的方式，耐心地教育公司的领导工作人员认识自己在这个问题上的责任，认识那种把甲乙双方关系当作不可解决的矛盾的看法的错误，认识资本主义经营思想对于社会主义性质企业的危害性。后来又进一步督促公司领导工作人员检查工作，结合冬训在职工中发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评。经过职工群众的广泛揭发和检查，公司领导工作人员更加深刻地体会到资本主义经营思想的危害，因而在实际行动中有了很大的转变。在贯彻今年全年计划中，公司领导方面不只是重视向职工进行了正确认识甲乙双方关系和反对资本主义经营作风的教育，而且抓住了厉行节约、改善工程质量两个环节，主动地同甲方联系，取得密切协作。半年多来，这个公司的经营管理确实有了改进。这说明报纸的批评已经真正成为推动这个公司改进工作的动力。不难想像，如果洛阳市委没有采取切实有效的措施来帮助被批评者树立对待报纸批评的诚恳态度，如果听任被批评者推卸责任或者检讨过“关”，那末这一正确的批评是不可能收到改进工作的实际成效的。
    党组织对于报刊上反映群众正确意见的批评给予重视和支持，对于被批评者的任何抗拒批评或压制批评的行为进行严肃的批评和斗争，不仅可以帮助被批评者认识错误改进工作，而且必然会提高群众的积极性，提高他们的国家主人翁觉悟。这可以从中共中南建筑工程局第七工程处委员会处理“工地生活”报上的一件批评得到证明。中南建筑工程局原第七工程处五四○六工地在今年一月中旬生产计划超额完成了很多，工地领导人员没有据实上报超额数字，却想从中旬计划超额数字中留下一部分弥补下旬，以便下旬也能继续“超额”。当这一对待国家计划不严肃的错误做法在中南建筑工程局政治部主办的“工地生活”报上被揭发后，工地的行政领导人员非但没有从思想上进行深入检查，反而对批评者实行讽刺和压制。中共中南建筑工程局第七工程处委员会没有容忍五四○六工地领导人员以这种错误态度对待报纸的批评。他们组织了一个检查组，在党委书记领导下，到工地检查工作，并给批评者以鼓励和支持。经过检查，弄清批评的事实完全正确后，党委负责同志便找工地领导人员个别谈话，帮助他们认识错误，并要求他们联系党的七届四中全会决议的学习来进行检查，作出公开的检讨。通过这一事件的处理，教育了广大职工认识到党是支持群众开展批评特别是自下而上的批评的，从而提高了他们对党和国家事业的责任感。如统计员吴鹤皋就表示：“我以前的工作态度就是领导怎样说，便怎样做，不管是否对，没有政治责任感。通过这一批评，使我深深地体会到：党对坚持原则的批评是支持的爱护的，不管什么领导干部要是压制批评都要受到处分。”四月份他发现计划中眷属宿舍有二万元是已经完成了的项目，便及时地提出来往上报。十分明显，正是因为中共中南建筑工程局第七工程处委员会对于报刊上的批评采取了热烈欢迎和坚决保护的态度，对于抗拒批评者进行了严肃的斗争，才使得“工地生活”报发表的这一批评产生了动员广大职工积极参加对生产的保证监督的效果。
    随着党的七届四中全会决议的深入贯彻，许多党组织更加关心在报刊上开展批评和自我批评，更加重视向党员特别是被批评者进行正确对待报刊批评的教育，这是十分必要的。但是并不是所有的党组织都认识到以批评和自我批评的精神教育干部的严重意义，认识到为报刊批评的实际效果而斗争是自己的不可推诿的责任。河南日报曾在一九五四年十一月十七日发表了南嘉和同志批评焦作煤矿小马村工区不按程序施工以致造成浪费现象的稿件。这个批评的基本精神和基本事实是正确的，只是在个别的事实上有出入（自然，这是报纸的缺点），但是遭到了被批评者的公然抗拒。负责工程施工的原汉口煤矿基本建设局（现为焦作煤矿基本建设局）施工处长史日新竟认为批评者“造反”，要给批评者“算账”；党总支书记范仁杰则诬说报纸的批评“完全是假报道”，不愿作任何检查。当河南日报在今年三月十二日再一次批评了他们对待报纸批评的错误态度后，范仁杰等更是变本加厉地对批评者大肆攻击，说批评者是“个人主义、官僚主义、报复思想”，同时颠倒黑白，硬把浪费现象说成“节约”，要求报纸公开检讨，恢复他们的“名誉”。这种粗暴地压制群众批评和抗拒报纸批评的行为，显然是同一个共产党员对待批评应有的谦虚诚恳的态度没有丝毫共同之点的，这就应当得到党组织的严肃处理。但是原中共汉口煤矿基本建设局总支委员会对报纸的两次批评根本没有进行讨论，对范仁杰等压制批评和抗拒报纸批评的行为不去进行斗争，采取了腐朽的自由主义态度。中共焦作煤矿委员会对范仁杰等的错误虽然进行过一些批评，可是在中共河南省委纪律检查委员会对这个事件进行检查以前，他们并没有采取切实有效的措施来及时纠正范仁杰等的错误。党组织对于抗拒批评和压制批评行为的姑息和容忍，就是对于干部中的资产阶级个人主义思想、骄傲自满情绪和官僚主义作风的姑息和容忍，就是对于我们工作中的缺点和错误的姑息和容忍，这是不符合于党和国家的利益的，对于犯错误的干部本身也是不利的。事实正是这样。当范仁杰等对报纸的第一次批评采取了错误的态度时，由于党组织没有及时地同他们的错误进行坚决斗争，这就使得他们对报纸的第二次批评采取了更为恶劣的态度。同时由于他们一直抗拒报纸的正确批评，拒绝党和群众的监督，也就使得他们所领导的小马村工区的浪费现象不但没有得到克服，反而日益严重，这个工区甚至从今年一月到七月份月月都没有完成计划。这一教训是值得我们记取的。
    我们党所领导的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的成绩一天比一天大，这自然是非常好的事情。不好的是某些共产党员在这些成绩面前往往容易滋长骄傲自满情绪，因而看不见工作中的缺点和错误，看不见这些缺点和错误不仅直接使我们的社会主义事业受到不利的影响，而且必然会给敌人以进行破坏活动的条件。近来各地揭露的反革命分子的暗害活动，清楚地说明了敌人是如何千方百计地寻找我们思想上和工作上的弱点，利用我们工作中的漏洞来进行破坏。正是在当前革命事业迅速推进和阶级斗争日益尖锐的形势下，党中央特别强调充分地开展批评和自我批评，强调通过报刊吸引人民群众公开地批评我们工作中的缺点和错误，并监督我们纠正缺点和错误，是有十分重大的意义的。为使报刊上的批评和自我批评更充分更健全地开展起来，报纸编辑部固然应当努力克服开展批评的各种障碍，保证批评的完全正确；各级党组织也应当经常地深入地教育党员特别是被批评者对报刊批评采取正确的态度，为报刊批评获得良好效果而斗争。
