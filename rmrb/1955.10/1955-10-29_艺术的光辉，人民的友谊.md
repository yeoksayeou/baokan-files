    Although the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Troupe has already left Sweden and arrived in Norway, its successful performances have left beautiful memories among the Swedish public, and the friendship it has spread is deeply engraved in the hearts of the Swedish people. The sincere words of a Swedish mother of four are a vivid example. At the end of the troupe's performance in Gothenburg, she asked the reporter to convey to all the actors: "We will never forget your visit. You have brought us beautiful art and your kindness from afar. When you return to Beijing, please remember that you have sincere friends in Sweden."
    When Swedish residents meet the artists of the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Troupe, they often like to ask: "How long does it take you to get to Sweden by train, and how many days by plane?" Indeed, China and Sweden are separated by thousands of miles, and mutual understanding is still so insufficient. However, the performance of Chinese classical opera art has built a bridge between the people of the two countries, promoting mutual understanding and friendship.
    The performance of the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Troupe caused a sensation in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, and throughout the country. "Peking Opera" has become a frequently discussed topic. "Southern Sweden Daily" reported: "The guests from China have achieved exciting success—people rarely talk about anything else, especially among theater people." Swedish critic Kusovsky said that the Peking Opera performance "almost brought the audience to the edge of madness." Theater critic Hood believed that Peking Opera was "incredibly spectacular." Royal Theater Director Berg Lund commented on the effect of Peking Opera's performance in this theater: This is "the most interesting and most noteworthy visiting performance in the history of the Royal Theater."
    The Swedish public showed extraordinary admiration and love for the Chinese artists. Many people regarded it as an honor to get the autographs of Chinese Peking Opera actors. When the troupe was performing at the Stockholm Royal Theater, a group of Swedish ballet dancers crowded backstage, shyly waiting to get the autographs of the Chinese actors, and they were all ecstatic when they achieved their goal. After a performance in Gothenburg, Swedish famous actress Ternstedt excitedly hugged the actors and kissed them passionately, expressing her admiration and adoration for Peking Opera. At the end of each performance, the theater community, local councils, and the government always presented the troupe with laurel wreaths with yellow and blue ribbons bearing the Swedish flag to express the highest praise for the performance.
    The reason why Peking Opera has won such praise from the Swedish audience, as pointed out by Swedish artists, is due to its connection with the people, its vitality, its artistic expression and sense of humor, and its artistic integrity. Peking Opera is able to infect the audience so greatly that it wins their hearts. Theater critic Leser said: "This revolutionary, ancient and young drama, which is combined with tradition, creates its own all-round and factual drama with the rhythm of poetry, the coordination of martial arts, the interspersed humor and fantasy, the clear lyricism, the complex performances, and the light colors… The forgotten cornerstone has been discovered here. If modern drama is to develop on a solid foundation, these cornerstones are indispensable."
    The Swedish public also learned the truth about New China from the troupe's visit. Although Peking Opera has a long history, it is only in the New China of the people that it has been valued and developed, and it has been introduced to the distant Scandinavian Peninsula for the first time. Swedish Dance Association Chairman Hague said: "We see that China has given life to ancient culture. In this culture, tradition is opening new flowers."
    During the troupe's visit to Sweden, people often liked to say that the Swedes had caught "China fever." This interest in China is not only reflected in people wearing Chinese-style cheongsams and clothes made of Chinese fabrics, but also more in the desire to better understand China and have more exchanges with China. Behind the stage of the Royal Theater, a Swedish musician stood next to the Chinese Peking Opera accompaniment band for several nights in a row, carefully studying the performance of Chinese classical musical instruments. There are countless examples of this kind of interest in everything about China. At the meeting between Chinese and Swedish artists, many people expressed the hope to have the opportunity to visit China. Some also expressed their intention to send their children to China to study art. Swedish famous dancer Akesson attended almost every performance of the troupe in Stockholm. She was particularly interested in the dance in Peking Opera. She also performed three of her own dance programs specifically for the Chinese artists.
    In contact with the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Troupe, Swedish artists sincerely revealed their desire to strengthen cultural exchanges between China and Sweden. Swedish artists, like Chinese artists, know that through mutual exchange of experiences and learning, art will continue to move towards perfection.

### 艺术的光辉，人民的友谊

    艺术的光辉，人民的友谊新华社记者　帅鹏
    中国古典歌舞剧团虽然已经离开瑞典到达挪威，但是它的成功的演出在瑞典公众中间留下了美好的记忆，它所传播的友谊深深地铭刻在瑞典人民的心里。瑞典的一位四个孩子的母亲所说的一番真挚的话，就是一个生动的实例。她在剧团结束哥德堡的演出时要记者转告全体演员们：“我们永远不会忘记你们的访问。你们从遥远的地方为我们带来了优美的艺术，也带来了你们的善意。当你们回到北京的时候，请记住：在瑞典有着你们真诚的朋友。”
    瑞典居民见到中国古典歌舞剧团的艺术家们常喜欢问：“你们到瑞典来乘火车要走多长时间，坐飞机又要几天？”的确，中瑞两国相隔何止千里，相互间的了解又还是这样不够。但是，中国古典戏剧艺术的表演在两国人民间架起了一道桥梁，促进了彼此的了解，促进了彼此的友谊。
    中国古典歌舞剧团的演出轰动了瑞典的首都斯德哥尔摩以至全国各地。“京剧”成了人们经常谈到的题目。“南瑞典日报”报道说：“来自中国的客人得到了激动人心的成功——人们的话题很少谈到其他的事情，特别是在戏剧界人士中间。”瑞典评论家库索夫斯基说：京剧的演出“几乎把观众带到了疯狂的边缘。”剧评家胡德认为京剧是“不可思议的壮观”。皇家剧院总经理伯格隆德在评论京剧在这个剧院演出的效果时说：这是“皇家剧院历史上最有趣和最令人注意的访问演出。”
    瑞典公众对中国艺术家们表现了非常的敬慕和热爱。许多人以得到中国京剧演员的签名为光荣。当剧团在斯德哥尔摩皇家剧院演出时，挤在后台的一群瑞典巴蕾舞演员羞涩地期待着得到中国演员的签名，而当他们达到了目的之后全都兴高采烈。当剧团在哥德堡一次演出结束后，瑞典著名的女演员特恩斯台特激动地抱着演员们热烈地接吻，表示她对京剧的钦佩和倾倒。剧团在每一处演出结束时，戏剧界、地方议会和政府总是用带有瑞典国旗的黄蓝两色的飘带的桂叶花环献给剧团，来表示对演出的最高的赞誉。
    京剧所以赢得瑞典观众的这样推崇，正像瑞典的艺术家所指出的，是由于它和人民的联系，它的生命力，它的表现的艺术和幽默感以及它的艺术的完整性。京剧能够给观众这样大的感染以至于赢得了他们的心。剧评家莱塞说：“这个和传统结合在一起的、革命的、古老而又年青的戏剧，以诗歌的音韵、武艺的配合、诙谐幻想的穿插、清晰的抒情、复杂的表演、浅淡的颜色，创造了自己的各方面的和事实相同的戏剧……。在这里发现了被人遗忘了的基石，如果现代的戏剧要在稳固的基础上发展起来，这些基石是不可缺少的。”
    瑞典公众也从剧团的访问中了解到新中国的真相。京剧尽管有它悠久的历史，但是只有在人民的新中国，它才得到重视和发展，并且第一次把它介绍到了遥远的斯堪的那维亚半岛。瑞典舞蹈协会主席哈格说：“我们看到中国给了古老的文化以生命。在这个文化中，传统在开放着新的花朵。”
    在剧团访问瑞典期间，人们常常爱说，瑞典人得了“中国热”。这种对中国的兴趣还不仅表现在人们穿上中国式的旗袍和中国料子的衣服，而且更多地表现在切望更好地了解中国、更多地和中国来往。在皇家剧院舞台后面一位瑞典的音乐家一连几晚站在中国京剧伴奏乐队旁边，仔细地研究中国古典乐器的演奏。这种对中国的一切都感到兴趣的事情是举不胜举的。在中瑞两国艺术家的会见中，许多人表示希望能有机会到中国去访问。有的还表示要把儿女送到中国去学习艺术。瑞典著名的女舞蹈家阿柯逊几乎出席了剧团在斯德哥尔摩的每一次演出。她特别对京剧中的舞蹈感到兴趣。她还专门为中国艺术家表演了她自己的三个舞蹈节目。
    瑞典艺术家们在同中国古典歌舞剧团接触中间，真诚地流露了加强中瑞两国文化交流的愿望。瑞典的艺术家也和中国艺术家一样知道，通过相互的交流经验和学习，艺术就会不断地趋于完善。
