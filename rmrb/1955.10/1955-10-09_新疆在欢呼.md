Xinjiang Cheers
Bì Yě

On October 1, 1955, on this great and glorious day, as the cannons roared in Tiananmen Square and the people of the whole country cheered "Long live the Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!", in the city of Urumqi, in this remote frontier, people of all ethnic groups, wearing all kinds of festive costumes, danced and sang in a parade down the long streets to celebrate the National Day and the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

Amidst the fluttering flags and waving flowers, the steps and faces of people of all ethnic groups expressed joy, happiness, and high spirits. Among them were workers proficient in the latest machinery, farmers increasing the nation's production of cotton and grain, herdsmen skilled in grazing cattle, horses, and sheep, hunters with unerring marksmanship, and weavers with nimble fingers weaving magnificent carpets... These outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland were reveling in their powerful and prosperous motherland, reveling in the realization of their beautiful ideal of national autonomy. They thanked the creators of their happiness; every heart turned towards Beijing, towards the wise leader Mao Zedong, standing in Tiananmen Square.

For six years, under the glorious light of the Party's ethnic policies, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have obtained the equality and freedom they have dreamed of for thousands of years. The exploitation and oppression of feudal dynasties and the Kuomintang have become historical relics. The painful days of enslavement are gone forever, and the desolate years of men being slaughtered and women and children suffering from hunger and cold will never return. Today, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang live happily in the big family of the nation.

Now, when the mighty parade of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang shouts "Yasha Song" (Long Live), when the people of Uyghur, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, and other ethnic groups shout the name of Mao Zedong in unison, it is not difficult for us to understand their infinite and sincere feelings. Since liberation, thanks to the correct leadership and cordial care of the Party, and thanks to the joint efforts of the People's Liberation Army and the people of all ethnic groups, countless crisscrossing canals and reservoirs with glistening water, and countless pleasing oases, have appeared in this boundless Gobi desert that has existed for thousands of years. These oases are expanding year by year, approaching and connecting each other, and the output of wheat, cotton, rice, and corn is increasing year by year. The barren land of the past has now become the motherland's granary. Many new cities, towns, and villages have also appeared in this boundless Gobi desert. The towering chimneys of power stations, steel plants, textile mills, automobile repair plants, and tractor repair plants are smoking; hospitals shaded by orchards, nurseries surrounded by flowers, brightly lit theaters, clubs filled with laughter, and quiet libraries display a new and beautiful life.

Of course, you cannot correctly understand today's frontier of the motherland simply by looking at a map; even the latest edition of the map cannot keep up with the rapid progress of this region. On the map, you can measure the Tarim Basin, which is larger than the entire Sichuan Province, but it has gradually been occupied by farmland. On the empty Gobi desert on the map, cities like pearls have now appeared: the new city of Shihezi on the Manas River, the new Artush on the Kashgar River, the new Korla on the Peacock River, and the new Shajingzi on the Aksu River...

In recent years, this frontier has become prosperous, rich, and beautiful because people have responded to the call of the motherland, changed nature with hard work, and created a new life. In Yanqi, which has been famous for producing fine horses since ancient times, countless steeds are no longer used for war, but are harnessed to plows and harrows, and provide the elderly, girls, and children with the most nutritious mare's milk. In Kuqa, known as the ancient Kingdom of Kucha, on the banks of the Baha River, instead of manufacturing weapons for the reactionary ruling class as in the past, rows of blast furnaces are now forging various agricultural tools for their farmer brothers, and those handsome girls with a flower tucked in their temples have also walked from dark boudoirs to the bright fields.

In Shajingzi, Aksu, in the past, people could not bear the oppression of the Kuomintang and landlords, and fled their hometowns to reclaim wasteland here, but the landlords followed them and pointed their canes from the high ground, and the newly reclaimed land became their farms again. In the past, this land, soaked with tears of exploitation, has now become the garden of agricultural cooperatives, and people's tears have turned into laughter.

Yes, the sorrowful days are gone forever. In Kashgar, Uyghur women no longer run to the Tomb of Xiangfei, leaning against the tomb walls to lament their misfortune, their husbands no longer go far away to make a living, their sons are no longer conscripted into the army, and their daughters are no longer trampled upon. The grain harvested on the fertile land of Seman Township is no longer taken away by the landlords, and there is no longer any hard labor for a year leaving only a pile of wheat straw. Some of their husbands have become village chiefs or heads of agricultural cooperatives, some of their sons have become cultivation team leaders or group leaders, and some of their daughters have become drivers of seeders or harvesters. Their courtyards are covered with red apricots as if dressed in morning glow, and their threshing grounds are covered with golden Ukrainian wheat.

In the Gongnais River valley of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, Kazakh herdsmen no longer carry their tents and drive their sparse cattle and sheep to wander around. They have used new agricultural tools for the first time to carry out cultivation, and in the harvest season, they have tasted the sweetness of grain; between the clear blue Kapu River and the towering snow-capped mountains, on that thousand-mile pasture, there are herds of strong horses frolicking everywhere, girls milking cows and making butter everywhere, and flocks of sheep moving everywhere. The tall wildflowers cover the hillsides like continuous, magnificent brocade; the vast pasture is as flat and bright as blue silk ironed with an iron. The wives and daughters of the herdsmen and the flocks of sheep are no longer looted by bandits, and they no longer have only a thin horse wandering in the mountains to beg for food. Now, they have grass cutters for storing grass for the herds to overwinter, small schools for their children, and medical teams and veterinary teams sent for the health of people and animals. An old Kazakh herdsman, using his spare time, makes a "Dombra" every few days, saying that he wants to let the young people in the entire pastoral area sing and play for the beautiful life of today.

Whether you are from Kashgar City on the edge of the Kunlun Mountains to Ashan City on the edge of the Altai Mountains, or from Ili on the western border to Hami near Gansu, the ethnic girls love to wear the newly produced Tianshan calico skirts, blue background with white flowers, like white lotuses in green waves. This is a product of the July 1st Cotton Textile Factory. In the past reactionary ruling years, girls without a whole piece of clothing in the three winter months and six summer months now have bright dance skirts. Their singing voices have become clear and sweet, and they are singing the People's Liberation Army stationed on this frontier of the motherland with their pure love.

Our heroic People's Liberation Army not only freed the people of all ethnic groups in this frontier from the dark years of disaster and entered the bright and happy era, but also participated in the socialist construction of the frontier with a hundredfold diligence. They not only built factories for printing calico for the girls, not only taught farmers of all ethnic groups to use new agricultural tools and apply new cultivation techniques, but also established many large-scale demonstration farms on the boundless Gobi desert.

Whether in Yanqi, Aksu, Kashgar, Urumqi, Hami, Ili, or the Manas River Basin, the crops on the vast military reclamation farms are like an ocean. The field canals, like silver threads interwoven on green satin, and the clear reservoirs, like mirrors opened during morning makeup, add a moving charm to this abundant nature.

When you see the Shandong girls, who came to this frontier of the motherland to support the construction of the interior, picking flowers in the flat and boundless cotton fields, can you not find them particularly lovely? When you see our battle-tested heroic soldiers driving tractors, reclaiming wasteland on the edge of the land in the morning, dusk, and night, turning up black soil from the primitive wasteland of thousands of years, or driving combine harvesters harvesting in the vast wheat fields, can you not feel happy? When you see our water conservancy soldiers completing the construction of reservoirs and dams after enduring freezing snow water, and then going to another barren valley to open up a new construction site, can you not sincerely pay tribute to them? When you see the soldiers participating in basic construction, building a beautiful new city for the people in the severe cold and snow, and immediately carrying their bags and tools to build another new city, can you not give them lofty love? When you see our grazing soldiers, how they set up tents on the boundless pasture, regardless of the night rain or the scorching sun, guarding the sheep with their guns day and night, the wool they personally shear is woven into the sweaters you wear, and they warm you with their hard work, can you not thank them?

Yes, some of our soldiers were wounded during the 25,000-mile Long March, some left scars during the long Anti-Japanese War, and some shed blood in the battle to defend Yan'an. Our invincible soldiers, who love the motherland and are loyal to the Party, are now creating immense wealth for the country and the people. They are in the frontier, but their feelings are closely connected to the Party Central Committee, and closely connected to the motherland and the people. They affectionately miss the leader, miss the old chief, and when they see brothers from afar, the first thing they ask is about the health of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and General Peng Dehuai; they also earnestly inquire about the construction and people's lives in the interior, and when they know that they are going to develop the Yellow River water conservancy to fundamentally control the Yellow River water damage, and benefit millions of generations of descendants, When they knew that the Yangtze River Bridge was being built, when they knew that Wuhan and Baotou iron and steel joint enterprises would be established with new technology and facilities, when they knew that newly graduated young people had embarked on various beautiful jobs and the children had started a new school year, how proud and proud they were of their work!

On the Pamir Plateau, 5,000 meters above sea level, known as the roof of the world, our border guards are constantly patrolling the border line, even in June, when the wind is mixed with snow. They live in an environment where icebergs are bursting, the snow is deep to the horse's belly, the air is thin, and they can't eat fresh vegetables all year round; but the soldiers understand the sacred responsibility they shoulder, and they proudly describe themselves as "the eyes of the motherland, the sentinels of peace." Whether it is day when the snow reflects light and swells their eyes, or night when the brims of their fur hats are covered with water drops, they faithfully and bravely perform their duties. They ensure the safe production of thousands of factories, enable millions of farms to reap a harvest, and breed herds of cattle, sheep, and horses in the Kunlun Mountains, the Tianshan Mountains, and the Altai Mountains; they allow the elderly of all ethnic groups to spend a peaceful old age, prevent the young girls of all ethnic groups from being humiliated, and prevent young mothers from being frightened, and the babies sleep sweetly in a smile after eating enough milk.

That is why, before the heavy snow seals the mountains, people of all ethnic groups scramble to send firewood to the border checkpoints, and after the mountain roads thaw, they also inform the border defense headquarters to quickly send grain to the border checkpoints. When the summer floods break out and the torrents of snow water roll rocks, and individual soldiers are washed away by the water when they cross the river on emergency tasks, they will shout in surprise, rescue the soldiers in the turbulent waves, and the women will pick up the soldiers' military kettles, fill them with white snow, warm them in their arms, and feed them to the soldiers to wake them up.

It is precisely because of the leadership of the Party that the army and the people have established a flesh-and-blood relationship, and the people of all ethnic groups have formed an unbreakable unity, and have carried out hard and selfless labor; it is precisely because of the leadership of the Party that the construction cause of the frontier is like a rushing torrent merging into the sea of socialist construction of the motherland. The north and south of Xinjiang have become the motherland's granary, rich oil fields have appeared at the foot of the Altai Mountains and the Kunlun Mountains, and the desolate Tianshan Mountains for thousands of years have become the treasure house of our motherland - people are mining the world's most precious minerals, logging endless pine wood, and using the snow water of the mountain peaks to irrigate the millions of hectares of cultivated land and generate huge electricity.

After the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, which is being laid day and night, is fully opened to traffic, busy trains will come fully loaded and go fully loaded. By that time, the people in the interior can eat flour produced in Xinjiang, wear Tianshan calico skirts woven from cotton weighing six or seven centimeters per flower in the Manas River Basin, use Hetian's gorgeous carpets and colorful silk fabrics, wear Kuqa's lambskin, and eat a lot of Hami melon, Turpan seedless grapes, Ili apples, and Kashgar's fragrant and crispy Bada almonds.

When the highway connecting Xinjiang to the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai and to Dunhuang and Anxi is built, Jin Hongshan, the old Yumen Pass, and the Yangguan ancient road will become prosperous areas; when the highway connecting Xinjiang to Lhasa, Tibet is built, the Kunlun Mountains will bow to us, and Urumqi and Lhasa will be tightly connected, no longer blocked by the peaks above the snow line.

The motherland is moving forward, and the frontier of the motherland is moving forward. When you see the jubilant ranks of people of all ethnic groups dancing and singing in the long streets of Urumqi today to celebrate the National Day and the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, you will feel how glorious the Mao Zedong era is, how united the people of all ethnic groups are under the guidance of Mao Zedong, how enthusiastic and heroic they are, and how the people of all ethnic groups are moving towards a happier future in step with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party.

    新疆在欢呼
    碧野
    一九五五年十月一日，在这伟大光辉的日子，当天安门的礼炮轰鸣，当全国人民欢呼共产党、毛主席万岁的时候，在这遥远边疆的城市——乌鲁木齐，各族人民为了庆祝国庆和新疆维吾尔自治区成立，穿着各式各样的盛装，载歌载舞地列队在长街上前进。
    在旗帜的飘扬和鲜花的挥舞中，各族人民的步伐和脸孔，都表现出欢乐幸福的昂扬情绪。他们当中有熟练地掌握了最新机械技术的工人，有给国家增产高额棉粮的农民，有善于牧放牛马羊群的牧民，有打枪百发百中的猎人，有用灵巧的手指织出绚烂的地毯的织女……这些祖国优秀的儿女，正为自己强大繁荣的祖国，正为自己民族自治的美丽理想的实现而狂欢。他们感谢他们幸福的缔造者，他们的每一颗心此刻都朝向北京，朝向正站在天安门上的英明的领袖毛泽东。
    六年来，在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，新疆各族人民获得了千百年来梦寐以求的平等和自由。封建王朝和国民党的剥削、压迫，已经成了历史的陈迹。那被奴役的惨痛日子已经永远过去，那男人被杀戮、妇女孩子挨饿受冻的凄凉岁月已经永远不复返。新疆的各族人民，今天已经美满地生活在民族的大家庭里。
    现在，当新疆各族人民浩浩荡荡的游行队伍欢呼“亚夏颂”（万岁）的时候，当维吾尔、哈萨克、塔吉克、柯尔克孜等等民族的人民同声欢呼着毛泽东的名字的时候，我们不难理解他们这种无限真挚的感情。解放以来，由于党的正确的领导和亲切的关怀，由于人民解放军和各族人民的共同努力，这千年万代无边的戈壁荒滩，已经出现了无数水光闪闪的纵横渠道和水库，已经出现了无数爽心悦目的绿洲。这片片绿洲一年比一年扩大，一年比一年互相接近、毗连，麦子、棉花、稻子和玉米的产量一年比一年高。往昔的不毛之地，现在已变成了祖国的大粮仓。在这无边的戈壁荒滩上，也出现了许多新的城市、集镇和村庄。发电站、钢铁厂、纺织厂、汽车修配厂和拖拉机修配厂的高耸云霄的烟囱在冒烟，果林掩映的医院，花草围绕的托儿所，灯光明亮的剧院，充满了笑声的俱乐部和幽静的图书馆，显示出一种崭新的美丽的生活。
    当然，你光凭着地图，是很难正确地认识今天这祖国的边疆了，即使是最新一版的地图，它也赶不上这一地区实际的飞速进展。在地图上你用手量一量那塔里木盆地，它比四川全省还要大罢，但它也已经被农田逐渐占领。在地图上空着的戈壁滩上，现在已经出现了明珠似的城市，这就是玛纳斯河畔的石河子新城、喀什噶尔河畔的新阿图什、孔雀河畔的新库尔勒、阿克苏河畔的新沙井子……
    几年来，这边疆变得繁荣、富饶和美丽，是由于人们响应祖国的号召，用辛勤的劳动改变了大自然，创造了新的生活。在自古著名出产良马的焉耆，那无数的骏马已不是用作征战，而是在套着犁耙耕耘，在供给老人、姑娘和孩子以最富营养的马奶。在古时被称为龟兹国的铸造宝剑的库车，现在在巴哈河岸上，已不再像过去那样为反动统治阶级制造砍伐的利器，而成排成列的鼓风炉正在为自己的农民兄弟打着各式各样的农具，那些鬓边倒插着一枝鲜花的俊俏的姑娘们，也已经从幽暗的闺阁走向明朗的田间。
    在阿克苏的沙井子，往昔人们受不了国民党和地主的压榨，逃离自己的故乡到这里来开荒，可是地主却跟踪追来，站在高地上把手杖一指，这些刚开垦出来的土地又成了他的农庄。往昔这片滴满了眼泪的被榨取的土地，现在已变成了农业合作社的田园，人们的眼泪已经化为欢笑。
    是的，悲痛的日子已经永远过去了。在喀什，维吾尔族妇女们不再跑到香妃墓前，靠着墓墙哭诉她们的不幸，她们的丈夫不再远走千里去谋生，她们的儿子不再被抓兵，她们的女儿不再被蹂躏。色满乡肥沃的土地上收获的粮食不再被地主夺去，不再有一年的辛苦劳动只剩下一堆麦秸的事了。她们的丈夫有的已经成了村长或农业社长，她们的儿子有的已经成了耕作队长或组长，她们的女儿有的已经成了播种机或收割机的驾驶手。她们的庭院像披上了朝霞似的垂满了红杏，她们的打麦场上已经铺满了金子似的乌克兰麦子。
    在伊犁哈萨克族自治州的巩乃斯河川，哈萨克牧民们不再驮着帐篷赶着稀少的牛羊到处流浪，他们运用了新式农具初次进行了耕作，在丰收的季节，他们尝到了谷物的香甜；在清蓝的卡波河和高耸的雪山之间，那千里牧场上，处处是膘壮的马群在嬉逐，处处是姑娘们在挤牛奶做酥油，处处是羊群在游动。那人高的野花布满了山岗，像连延不断的绚烂的织锦；那辽阔的牧场，像用熨斗熨过的蓝绸那么平整而鲜明。牧民们的妻女和羊群不再被土匪劫掠，不再光有一匹瘦马辗转于山野间乞食。现在，他们已经有为牧群过冬储草的割草机，已经有为孩子们设立的小学校，已经有为人畜的健康派来的医疗队和兽医队。有一个哈萨克老牧人，利用工作余暇，每隔几天就要制造出一把“东不拉”，他说他要让全牧区的年青人为今天美好的生活而弹唱。
    不论你是从昆仑山边的喀什市到阿尔泰山边的阿山城，或是从国境西边的伊犁到接近甘肃的哈密，各族姑娘们最爱穿的是刚刚出厂的天山花布裙子，蓝地白花，像绿波间的白莲。这是七一棉纺织厂的产品。在过去反动统治年月，三冬六夏上无整衣，下无完裙的姑娘们，现在已经有了鲜艳的舞裙。她们的歌喉变得清亮而甜蜜，她们正以自己纯洁的爱情歌唱着驻在这祖国边疆的人民解放军。
    我们英勇的解放军，不但使这边疆的各族人民摆脱了黑暗的灾难岁月，走进了光明的幸福年代，而且还百倍勤劳地参加了边疆的社会主义建设。他们不仅给姑娘们建筑了印织花布的工厂，不仅教会各族农民使用新的农具和运用新的耕作技术，而且在无边的戈壁滩上建立起许许多多大规模的示范农场。
    不论在焉耆、在阿克苏、在喀什、在乌鲁木齐、在哈密、在伊犁、在玛纳斯河流域，辽阔的军垦农场上的庄稼赛海洋。那像在绿缎上面交织着银丝线似的田间水渠，那像晨妆时开启着的镜面似的清明的水库，给这丰盛的大自然添上了动人的魅力。
    当你看见为支援内地建设而来到这祖国边疆的山东姑娘们在平坦无边的棉花地里拾花的时候，你能不觉得她们格外可爱么？当你看见我们身经百战的英雄战士们驾驶着拖拉机，在清晨、黄昏和黑夜的地边开荒，从千年万代的原始荒滩翻出黑色土壤的时候，或驾驶着康拜因在万顷麦田上收割的时候，你能不感到喜悦么？当你看见我们的水利战士们?着冰冻的雪水完成建筑水库和拦河坝后，又到另一个荒山野谷去开辟新的工地的时候，你能不衷心向他们致敬么？当你看见参加基本建设的战士，在严寒的风雪中刚给人们建筑成一座美丽的新城，立即又背起他们的行囊和工具去建筑另一座新城的时候，你能不对他们寄予崇高的爱戴么？当你看见我们的牧放战士，是怎样在无边的牧场上搭起帐篷，不管夜雨浇身或烈日晒顶，日夜背着枪防狼牧放着羊群，他们亲手剪下的羊毛织成你身上的毛衣，他们以自己的辛劳使你身上发暖，你能不感谢他们么？
    是的，我们有些战士曾经在二万五千里长征中负过伤，曾经在长期的抗日战争中留下了伤疤，又曾经在保卫延安的战斗中流过血。我们这些对祖国热爱、对党忠贞的无敌战士，现在又在为国家为人民创造无限巨大的财富。他们身在边疆，但感情却紧紧地联系着党中央，紧紧地联系着祖国和人民。他们亲切地念着领袖，念着老首长，当他们看见从关内远来的兄弟，第一句话就要问毛主席、朱总司令、彭德怀将军的健康；他们也殷切地探问着内地的建设和人民的生活，当他们知道要开发黄河水利根治黄河水害，为千百万代的子孙造福的时候，当他们知道长江大桥兴建的时候，当他们知道将用崭新的技术设施建立武汉和包头钢铁联合企业的时候，当他们知道刚毕业的青年走上了各种美丽的工作岗位、孩子们又开始了新的学年的时候，他们对自己的工作是感到多么的骄傲和自豪呵！
    在拔海五千公尺被称为世界屋脊的帕米尔高原，我们的边防战士们时刻巡逻在即使是六月天也还是风绞雪的国境线上。他们生活在冰山暴裂，雪深到马肚子，空气稀薄，长年吃不到新鲜蔬菜的环境里；但是战士们懂得自己肩负的神圣责任，他们用自豪的感情形容自己是“祖国的眼睛，和平的哨兵”。不论是雪光刺得眼睛发肿的白天，或是皮帽檐结着水珠的黑夜，他们都忠勇地执行着自己的任务。他们使千百座工厂安全生产，使千万个农庄获得丰收，使昆仑山、天山和阿尔泰山的牧群繁殖；他们使各族的老人渡过平安的晚年，使各族的年轻姑娘不再受到凌辱，年轻母亲不再受到惊吓，婴儿吃足奶后甜蜜地在微笑中安睡。
    这就是为什么当大雪封山之前，各族人民争相送柴火到边卡上去，当山路开冻之后，又相走报讯让边防指挥部快快把粮食送往边卡。当炎夏山洪暴发，激流的雪水滚动山石，个别战士因紧急任务渡河，失足被水冲走的时候，他们就会惊相呼喊，在激浪中把战士救起，妇女们就会拿起战士的军用水壶，装进白雪，在怀里暖热，喂给战士喝，让战士甦醒。
    正是由于党的领导，军民建立了血肉的关系，各族人民形成了无间的团结，进行了辛勤忘我的劳动；也正是由于党的领导，边疆的建设事业正像奔腾的巨流汇入祖国社会主义建设的大海。南北疆成了我们祖国的大粮仓，阿尔泰山脚和昆仑山脚出现了丰富的油田，千秋万代荒凉的天山成了我们祖国的宝库——人们正在开采世界上最珍贵的各种矿产，采伐无尽的松木良材，而且利用群峰的雪水，灌溉开垦出来的千万顷良田，和发出巨大的电力。
    正在日夜铺轨的兰新铁路全线通车以后，繁忙的列车将满载而来又满载而去。到那个时候，关内的人民就可以吃到新疆生产的面粉，就可以穿到玛纳斯河流域由每朵六七公分重的棉花织成的天山花布衣裙，就可以用上和阗的华丽的地毯和多彩的丝织品，就可以穿到库车的子羔皮，就可以大量吃到哈密鲜瓜、吐鲁蕃无核鲜葡萄、伊犁的大苹果和喀什的又香又脆的巴达杏仁。
    当新疆通达青海柴达木盆地，和通达敦煌、安西的公路修通的时候，金鸿山、旧玉门关和阳关古道都将成为繁华的地区；当新疆通往西藏拉萨的公路修通的时候，昆仑山将向我们低头，乌鲁木齐和拉萨将紧紧地连在一起，不再被雪线以上的群峰所阻拦。
    祖国在前进，祖国的边疆在前进。当你看见今天庆祝国庆和新疆维吾尔自治区成立，乌鲁木齐的长街上的欢腾的各族人民的行列，载歌载舞地前进的时候，你会感到毛泽东时代是多么光辉，会感到在毛泽东教导下，各族人民是多么团结，是多么热情而豪迈，会感到在党的领导下，各族人民正和全国人民步调一致地走向更加幸福的未来。
