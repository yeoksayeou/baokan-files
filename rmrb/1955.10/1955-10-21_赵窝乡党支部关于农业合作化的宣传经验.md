    Zhaowo Township Party Branch on the Propaganda Experience of Agricultural Cooperation
    Wang Yanghao
    The Zhaowo Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Woyang County, Anhui Province, under the assistance of the higher party committee, is determined to lead the peasants to run agricultural producers' cooperatives well and take the socialist road. In order to meet the new upsurge in the development of the agricultural cooperation movement and to ensure the smooth progress of the cooperative work, the branch, based on the specific conditions of the township, comprehensively and deeply carried out propaganda and education work among the peasants of the entire township.
    Before the propaganda, the branch first convened a general meeting of party members in the township to enhance the party members' understanding of running cooperatives, made a resolution on the work of running cooperatives, and discussed many propaganda methods; then the party members went deep into the electoral districts to convene meetings of cooperative members, group members, and the masses to conduct extensive propaganda.
    Based on the characteristics of the township, the branch collected many specific materials, and from the practical to the theoretical, focused on publicizing the following three issues:
    First, the relationship between socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture. The branch first summarized the achievements made in agricultural production in the township over the past three years due to the support of industry: for example, the San’gai Cooperative cultivated sixty mu of wheat with new-style walking plows, with an average yield of 165 jin per mu, an increase of 20 jin compared to ordinary cultivated land; fifty-six mu of cotton, because pesticides were used to eliminate pests, yielded an average of 180 jin per mu; the Fanglou and other twelve agricultural cooperatives signed autumn plowing contracts for 3,000 mu of land with the animal-drawn farm implement station this autumn, enabling timely autumn sowing and creating favorable conditions for a bumper harvest next year. These facts all illustrate the benefits of socialist industrialization for agriculture. Party members pointed out in their propaganda that the more developed the country's industrial construction, the greater the support for agriculture. In the future, using tractors, applying new scientific technologies, and using more agricultural machinery for cultivation will greatly increase agricultural production, and the lives of farmers will be greatly improved. However, industrial construction and the socialist transformation of agriculture are inseparable. Only with the strong support of agriculture can industry develop rapidly. To develop agriculture, the only way is to organize and carry out large-scale agricultural production. Therefore, to take the socialist road and to enable the country to achieve socialist industrialization at an early date, farmers should actively organize and participate in agricultural producers' cooperatives, increase production, and support industrial construction. In this way, farmers will understand the relationship between the country's socialist industrialization and themselves, and the relationship between participating in agricultural cooperatives and the country's socialist construction.
    Second, summarize the achievements of running cooperatives in the past three years, calculate the increased production, and let cooperative members and individual farmers recognize the superiority of agricultural cooperatives. In this regard, the branch collected several specific examples. One is the example of the agricultural cooperative led by Qi Wenzhong. The cooperative has forty-three households, twenty-eight of whom were hired laborers before liberation. After the land reform, their lives improved, but their yields were still very low, and the grain they harvested was not enough to eat. In 1953, they organized mutual aid teams, and the highest wheat yield per mu reached 300 jin. After the transition to a cooperative, due to improved management, deep plowing, and careful cultivation, the highest wheat yield per mu reached 600 jin. This year, forty-two households sold more than 12,000 jin of surplus grain. Furthermore, due to the implementation of work to increase the proportion of summer harvests, change to planting high-yield and water-resistant crops, and change the habit of extensive planting and low yields (including production technology reforms), the entire cooperative will be able to harvest more than 200,000 jin of grain this autumn, with each member averaging more than 600 jin. Another example is the Fanglou cooperative, where the lives of the members are generally better than before the cooperative was established. Two-thirds of the members are wearing fine cloth; they have also added fourteen pairs of rubber shoes and fifteen fountain pens. Farmers have also turned over culturally. Of the 951 young people in the township, 656 were illiterate in the past. Over the past three years, more than 700 people have participated in literacy classes, and now more than 300 can read newspapers and books, more than 290 can write and calculate, and 35 have learned to operate radios and show filmstrips. By comparing these living facts with the past, everyone truly realized the benefits of cooperation and enhanced their socialist consciousness.
    Third, show the vision of the countryside, so that cooperative members clearly recognize the development prospects of agricultural cooperatives. There are currently twelve agricultural cooperatives in the township, and new atmospheres have emerged in both production and life. The state has specially established a new-style animal-drawn farm implement station in the area, equipped with ten seeders, eight harvesters, seven disc harrows, eight spike-tooth harrows, six weeders, and two double-wheeled double-furrow plows. The county cultural center has also transported radios, phonographs, filmstrip projectors, and books and newspapers to establish clubs and libraries, enriching the cultural life of the masses. The branch presented these facts, and then pointed out the development prospects of the countryside, enhancing the farmers' enthusiasm for running cooperatives. The cooperative members are all actively thinking about combining the small cooperatives to form large cooperatives.
    In addition to the above three contents, the branch also publicized issues such as the class line and mutual assistance and cooperation policies. Because the branch grasped the key points and carried out propaganda from the near to the far, from the practical to the theoretical, using the specific facts of the township, it penetrated deeply into the hearts of the people and achieved good results. After propaganda and education, more than 80% of the members of the twelve agricultural cooperatives in the township enthusiastically studied how to run the cooperatives well. Seven cooperative members voluntarily handed over the twelve mu of private land they had originally retained to the cooperative. Of the nine mutual aid teams and seventy-three group members in the township, sixty households requested to join the cooperative. The mutual aid team leader went to the cooperative director several times a day and also wrote two applications to join the cooperative. In addition, of the existing thirty-six individual farmers in the township, thirty are actively requesting to join the cooperative. Individual farmer Zhang Lanting has already prepared the wheat seeds and farm implements, and is waiting to join the cooperative. At present, the twelve cooperatives are actively preparing funds to add twenty-two head of livestock in preparation for running large cooperatives; and according to the state plan's required wheat planting area, more than 120,000 jin of wheat seeds have been selected in an effort to achieve a bumper harvest next year.

    赵窝乡党支部关于农业合作化的宣传经验
    王杨蒿
    中共安徽省涡阳县赵窝乡支部，在上级党委的帮助下，决心领导农民办好农业生产合作社，走社会主义的道路。为了迎接农业合作化运动发展的新高潮，使办社工作顺利进行，支部根据本乡的具体情况，全面深入地向全乡农民开展了宣传教育工作。
    宣传以前，支部首先召开了全乡党员大会，提高党员对办社的认识，做出了关于办社工作的决议，并讨论出不少的宣传办法；然后党员们深入到选区去召开社员、组员及群众会议进行广泛的宣传。
    支部根据本乡的特点收集了许多具体材料，从实际到理论，着重宣传了以下三个问题：
    第一、社会主义工业化和农业社会主义改造的关系。支部首先总结了全乡三年来农业生产方面由于工业的支持而获得的成绩：如三改社用新式步犁耕种了六十亩麦子，每亩平均收麦一百六十五斤，比普通耕地增产二十斤；五十六亩棉花，因为用药剂扑灭了虫害，每亩平均收到一百八十斤；方楼等十二个农业合作社今秋同马拉农具站订了三千亩地的秋耕合同，使秋种能及时进行，并给明年丰收创造了有利条件。这些事实都说明了社会主义工业化对农业的好处。党员在宣传中同时指出，国家工业建设越发达，对农业的支援也就越大，将来使用拖拉机、运用新的科学技术和更多的农业机器来进行耕作，农业产量就会大大提高，农民的生活也会大大改善。但是工业建设和农业的社会主义改造是分不开的，只有农业的大力支持，工业才能迅速地发展，而要发展农业，唯一的办法就是组织起来，进行大规模的农业生产。因此要走社会主义的道路，要使国家早日实现社会主义工业化，农民们就应该积极组织起来，参加农业生产合作社，增加生产，支援工业建设。这样使农民体会到国家社会主义工业化同自己的关系以及参加农业合作社同国家社会主义建设的关系。
    第二、总结三年来办社成绩，算增产账，使社员和单干农民认识到农业合作社的优越性。这方面，支部收集了几个具体例子。一个是祁文中领导的农业合作社的例子。该社四十三户，其中的二十八户解放前是帮人打短工的，土地改革后，生活有了改善，但是产量还很低，收的粮食不够吃；一九五三年组织了互助组，麦子每亩最高产量达到三百斤，转社后，由于改善经营、深耕细作，小麦最高产量每亩达到六百斤。今年四十二户卖出余粮一万二千多斤。并且由于推行了提高夏季收成比重，改种高产作物和耐水作物，改变广种薄收的习惯（包括生产技术改革）的工作，今秋全社能收二十多万斤粮食，每个社员平均摊到六百斤以上。另外一个方楼社，社员的生活一般都比办社前好了，三分之二的社员穿上了细布；还添了十四双胶鞋，十五枝自来水笔。农民们在文化上也翻了身，全乡九百五十一个青年，过去有文盲六百五十六人；三年来参加民校学习的有七百多人，现在三百多人能看报看书，二百九十多人能写会算，还有三十五人学会了开收音机和放映幻灯。用这些活生生的事实同过去的生活对比，大家才真正体会到合作化的好处，提高了社会主义觉悟。
    第三、展示农村的远景，使社员明确认识农业合作社的发展前途。该乡现有农业合作社十二个，在生产上和生活上都出现了新气象；国家特地在该地建立了一所拥有播种机十部、收割机八部、圆盘耙七部、钉齿耙八部、锄草机六部、双轮双铧犁两部的新式马拉农具站；县文化馆也运来了收音机、留声机、幻灯机和图书报刊等，建立了俱乐部、图书馆，丰富了群众的文化生活。支部把这些事实摆出来，再指出农村的发展远景，增强了农民的办社热情，社员们都积极想把小社联合起来办大社。
    除了以上三个内容外，支部对阶级路线和互助合作政策等问题也作了宣传。由于支部抓住了要点，用本乡的具体事实，从近到远，从实际到理论进行宣传，因而深入人心，收到了良好的效果。全乡十二个农业合作社，经过宣传教育，有百分之八十以上的社员都热情地研究如何把社办好。有七户社员，自动把原留的十二亩私有地交给了社。全乡九个互助组、七十三户组员，有六十户要求入社。互助组长一天找社主任几次，还写了两次入社申请书。另外全乡现有的三十六户单干农民中，有三十户积极要求入社。单干户张兰亭，已把麦种、农具准备停当，就等入社。目前十二个社正积极筹备资金，准备为办大社增添二十二头牲口；并按照国家计划要求的种麦面积，选好了十二万多斤麦种，争取明年丰产。
