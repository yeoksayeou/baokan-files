    Improving the Supply of Non-Staple Foods in Cities and Industrial and Mining Areas
    Non-staple foods are a daily necessity for the broad masses of people, especially those in cities and industrial and mining areas. If the supply of non-staple foods in cities and industrial and mining areas is inadequate, it will affect the people's lives, the stability of market prices, and the smooth progress of national economic construction. Therefore, it is essential to resolutely guarantee the supply to cities and industrial and mining areas and vigorously stabilize the prices of non-staple foods. This is an extremely important task placed before all staff and workers of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives.
    Over the past few years, all parts of the country have basically ensured the supply to cities and industrial and mining areas, achieving great success. However, it must be recognized that the tense situation in the supply of non-staple foods has not been eliminated today. According to materials from eleven cities including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, the amount of vegetables on the market in 1953 could only meet 74% of the needs, and in 1954 only 82%. Although production continued to increase in 1955, there were still times of overstocking and times of out-of-stock. The supply of meat and eggs was even worse than that of vegetables. In terms of the operation of non-staple foods, the strength of state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commercial enterprises is still relatively weak. The operating institutions are not sound, and the range of goods is not complete, which makes it difficult to guarantee supply and control the market. After the implementation of fixed-quantity grain supply in cities, residents' purchasing power will inevitably shift to other areas, especially to increasing the purchase of non-staple foods. Some people want to add non-staple foods to make up for the shortage of grain supply; some people want to add non-staple foods to improve their existing food standards; and some people may increase the amount of non-staple foods they store due to various concerns. This may make the supply of non-staple foods even more insufficient to meet demand. Party committees and relevant departments at all levels must pay sufficient attention to this situation.
    Since 1954, thanks to the strengthening of leadership over the production and operation of non-staple foods by the central government and various localities, the prices of non-staple foods have gradually stabilized, which is also a great achievement. However, the price level of non-staple foods, especially vegetables, is still too high in workers' living expenses. According to a report by the Liaoning Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, non-staple food expenditures account for as much as 24.92% of workers' total living expenses. High non-staple food expenditures, especially rising vegetable prices, have a significant impact on people with lower incomes and lower food standards. For example, in the canteens of the State Council, the proportion of non-staple foods in expenditures increased from 56.6% to 57.1% between 1953 and 1954, despite spending the same amount of money. Measures must be taken to improve this situation, otherwise it will affect the real wages of workers and the lives of the broad masses of people.
    The fundamental way to ensure the supply of non-staple foods and stabilize their prices is to actively develop the production of livestock, poultry, and vegetables. In this regard, there have also been many achievements in recent years, especially a significant increase in the sown area and yield of vegetables. Compared with 1952, the sown area of vegetables in Shanghai increased by 72%; the sown area in Beijing increased by 19%, and the yield increased by 35%. However, there are still two deviations in the production of non-staple foods: one is a one-sided restriction of production, and the other is a blind increase in production. Some places have one-sidedly emphasized saving grain and have prohibited or restricted farmers from raising livestock and poultry. In addition, due to the serious disasters in some areas last year, the output of pigs, chickens, and ducks has decreased this year. In other areas, there is a phenomenon of blind production. For example, in 1954, the supply of cabbage in Beijing was insufficient, and the price was high and profitable. This year, vegetable farmers have planted a large amount of cabbage. Even some vegetable production cooperatives do not resolutely implement the state plan and blindly expand production. As a result, there was a phenomenon of overstocking and price drops of cabbage in May and June this year. Both of these situations are not conducive to improving the supply of non-staple foods. In order to ensure the increase in the output of non-staple foods, these phenomena must be eliminated.
    In addition to increasing production in a planned way, we must actively improve the supply of non-staple foods. First of all, it is necessary to do a good job in adjusting supply between the off-season and the peak season, which is an important link in strengthening the supply of non-staple foods. Because non-staple foods, especially vegetables and aquatic products, are highly seasonal and difficult to store, if the seasonal adjustment is not strengthened, there will be a phenomenon of sometimes too much and sometimes too little, which is not conducive to producers and consumers. In the peak season of vegetable production, seize the time to dry vegetables, pickle vegetables, make salted fish, dried fish, etc.; in the off-season of vegetable production, plan to organize the production of non-staple foods such as tofu, bean sprouts, vermicelli, and starch sheets. These are specific ways to adjust non-staple foods, and this work should be carefully arranged. Secondly, it is necessary to adopt various supply methods according to different commodities and different targets. Meat and sugar, due to limited production and not being essential foods for everyone at every meal, can be supplied by controlling the sales quantity. Various vegetables are indispensable foods for everyone, so we should vigorously ensure the supply, at least ensuring that there are several major varieties of vegetables that are not in short supply in every season. The production of eggs and fish is highly seasonal, and preservation is very difficult, so sales should be expanded in the peak season, and supply should be guaranteed or appropriately organized for different targets in the off-season. Other items such as daylilies, wood ears, pickled mustard tubers, dried vegetables, etc., which can currently be purchased without restrictions, should maintain the status quo and appropriately reduce the purchase and sales prices. Doing a good job in the above two tasks can basically ensure the source of goods and reasonable supply.
    Of course, to do a good job in supply, it is also necessary to further organize the supply forces. In view of the fact that private commercial enterprises still account for a large proportion in the operation of non-staple foods, this force must be well utilized. Therefore, state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commercial enterprises should, according to the principle of division of labor between urban and rural areas combined with the division of labor in commodity management, organize the forces of private commercial enterprises engaged in non-staple foods, and actively carry out socialist transformation, so as to further play their role in market supply. At the same time, state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperative commercial enterprises must also gradually strengthen the operation and management of non-staple foods, gradually establish some specialized management institutions, increase and adjust some refrigeration equipment and processing equipment, and continue to improve the current operating work. It should be recognized that strengthening the supply of non-staple foods and arranging the transformation of private non-staple food commercial enterprises is a very complex task. Therefore, party committees at all levels must pay close attention to strengthening the leadership of this work, and all relevant departments must also actively strive to quickly improve the work, so as to successfully undertake this task.
    Strengthening the supply of non-staple foods is a long-term and important task, especially in the next few months, this work will be very heavy. Because on the one hand, winter is approaching, and the off-season of vegetable, fish, and egg production will gradually arrive; on the other hand, the demand for non-staple foods is particularly high during this period. Therefore, doing a good job in the supply in the next few months is very important. All staff and workers of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives should make a hundredfold effort to do this work well.

### 改善城市和工矿区的副食品供应工作

    改善城市和工矿区的副食品供应工作
    副食品是广大人民特别是城市和工矿区人民每日所需要的。城市和工矿区的副食品如果供应不好，就会影响人民的生活，影响市场物价的稳定和国家经济建设的顺利进行。因此，必须坚决保证城市和工矿区的供应，大力稳定副食品的价格。这是摆在国营商业和供销合作社全体职工面前的一项极其重要的任务。
    几年来，全国各地基本上保证了城市和工矿区的供应，取得了很大成绩。但是必须看到，副食品供应的紧张情况今天并未消除。根据北京、天津、上海等十一个城市的材料，一九五三年蔬菜上市量只能满足需要的百分之七十四，一九五四年只能满足需要的百分之八十二，一九五五年生产虽续有增加，但仍有时积压，有时脱销。至于肉类、蛋类的供应情况，比蔬菜还差。在副食品的经营方面，目前国营商业和合作社商业的力量也还比较薄弱，经营的机构既不健全，经营的品种也不齐备，更使得供应难以保证，市场不易控制。在城市实行粮食定量供应以后，居民的购买力必然还有一部分会转移到其它方面去，特别是转到增购副食品方面。一部分人要增添副食品弥补粮食供应的不足；一部分人要增添副食品提高现有伙食水平；还有一部分人，可能由于各种疑虑而增加一些副食品的储存数量。这就可能使副食品更加供不应求。对于这种情况，各地党委和有关部门，必须给以足够的重视。
    一九五四年以来，由于中央和各地加强了对副食品生产和经营的领导，副食品的价格逐渐趋于稳定，这也是很大的成绩。但是副食品的价格特别是蔬菜的价格水平，在职工生活费中仍然偏高。根据辽宁省工会的报告，职工的全部生活开支中，副食品的开支竟占到百分之二十四点九二。副食品开支大，特别是蔬菜价格上涨，对于收入较少和伙食标准较低的人影响是很大的。例如国务院机关食堂，一九五三年和一九五四年开支同样多的钱，副食品在开支中所占比重即由百分之五十六点六增至百分之五十七点一。对于这种情况，必须采取措施加以改善，否则就会使职工的实际工资和广大人民生活受到影响。
    保证副食品供应和稳定副食品价格的根本方法，莫过于积极发展家畜、家禽和蔬菜的生产。在这方面，最近几年来也有不少的成绩，特别是蔬菜的播种面积和产量有显著的增加。以一九五四年和一九五二年相比，上海市蔬菜播种面积增加了百分之七十二；北京市播种面积增加了百分之十九，产量增加了百分之三十五。但是在副食品生产中，目前还存在片面限产和盲目增产两种偏向。有些地方片面强调节约粮食，曾经禁止或限制农民饲养家畜和家禽，加之去年一部分地区灾情严重，今年生猪和鸡鸭的产量都有减少。在另一些地区，又存在盲目生产的现象。例如一九五四年北京市洋白菜不足，价高利大，今年菜农就大量种植洋白菜，甚至某些蔬菜生产合作社也不坚决贯彻国家计划，而盲目扩大生产，结果今年五、六月间就产生了洋白菜积压、掉价的现象。这两种情况同样不利于改善副食品的供应工作。为了保证增加副食品的产量，就必须消除这些现象。
    除了有计划地增加生产以外，我们必须积极改进副食品的供应工作。首先，就是要作好淡季和旺季的调剂，这是加强副食品供应的重要环节。因为副食品特别是蔬菜和水产，季节性很大，保管又不容易，如果不加强季节的调剂，就会产生时多时少的现象，对生产者和消费者都不利。在蔬菜生产旺季，抓紧晒干菜、腌咸菜、制咸鱼、干鱼等工作；在蔬菜生产的淡季，有计划地组织豆腐、豆芽、粉条、粉皮等副食品的生产，这些都是调剂副食品的具体办法，应该细致地安排这项工作。其次，必须分别不同商品和不同的对象，采取各种不同的供应办法。肉类和食糖，由于生产有限，又不是每人每餐都十分需要的食品，可以用控制销售数量的办法进行供应。各种蔬菜是人人必不可缺的食物，就应该大力保证供应，至少要作到每一个季节都能有几种大宗品种的蔬菜供应不缺。鸡蛋和鱼类生产的季节性很大，保存又十分困难，就应该在旺季时扩大销售，在淡季时分别不同对象保证供应或适当组织供应。其它如黄花、木耳、榨菜、干菜等等，目前可以不限购的，就应维持现状，并适当降低收购和销售价格。作好以上两项工作，就可以基本上保证货源和合理的供应。
    当然，要作好供应工作，还必须进一步组织供应的力量。鉴于副食品经营中私营商业还占有很大比重，这个力量必须很好地加以利用。因此国营商业和合作社商业，应该根据城乡分工结合商品经营分工的原则，分别将经营副食品的私营商业的力量组织起来，积极进行社会主义的改造，以便进一步发挥他们在市场供应工作中的作用。同时国营商业和供销合作社商业，也必须逐步加强副食品的经营和管理，逐步成立一些专业管理机构，增加和调整某些冷藏设备和加工设备，继续改善目前的经营工作。应该认识到，加强副食品供应工作和安排改造私营副食品商业是一项非常复杂的工作。因此，各级党委必须十分注意加强这一工作的领导，各有关部门也必须积极努力迅速改进工作，以便胜利地担负起这个任务。
    加强副食品供应工作是一个长期的重要的任务，特别是今后的几个月中，这项工作将十分繁重。因为一方面冬季快要到来了，蔬菜、鱼类、蛋类的生产淡季将逐渐来临；另一方面，在这一段时间内，副食品的需要量特别多。因此，作好今后几个月的供应工作是十分重要的。国营商业和供销合作社的全体职工，应该百倍努力作好这项工作。
