    Industrial Construction in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    Soviet Union Creates Automatic Radiation Brake
    An automatic brake that utilizes radioactivity in railway transport is being tested in the Soviet Union. This new device can automatically stop trains in front of red signal lights, completely avoiding the danger of collisions.
    This brake consists of two parts: a gamma-ray sensor installed on the locomotive and a gamma-ray emitter installed on the railway. This device only works when the red signal light is on. When the train passes a signal light and the signal light emits a red light, the radioactive cobalt in the gamma-ray emitter emits a beam of gamma rays that is invisible to the human eye, which is directed at the gamma-ray sensor installed on the locomotive. At this time, the gamma rays are converted into an electric current in the sensor, and the brake is activated, stopping the train.
    Soviet Union Manufactures Many New Heavy-Duty Machines
    Soviet heavy machinery manufacturing is producing and designing many powerful new heavy-duty machines.
    A huge automatic mobile excavator created by the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant in Sverdlovsk has a bucket capacity of 20 cubic meters and can excavate 15,000 cubic meters of soil per day. If this amount of earthwork were done manually, it would require more than 10,000 people. Currently, this factory is also manufacturing a large excavator with a bucket capacity of 25 cubic meters and a boom length of 100 meters.
    The Ordzhonikidze Machine Tool Manufacturing Plant in Podolsk has begun manufacturing the Soviet Union's first ultra-high temperature and high-pressure single-flow boiler, which is expected to have a steam pressure of 230 atmospheres and a steam generation temperature of 575 degrees.
    Poland's Steel Production Doubles in Six Years
    This year, Poland's steel production will reach 4.5 million tons, approximately double the production of 2.3 million tons in 1949, before the start of the Six-Year Plan (1950-1955). Since 1950, more than fifteen new and rebuilt blast furnaces and over thirty open-hearth furnaces have been constructed.
    The two largest steel enterprises in Poland—the Lenin Metallurgical Combine and the Beirut Steel Factory—were built during the Six-Year Plan. Currently, the Lenin Metallurgical Combine has four modern open-hearth furnaces and two giant blast furnaces in operation. Once fully completed, it will produce 1.5 million tons of steel annually, more than Poland's total pre-war steel production. The Beirut Steel Factory has already built six modern open-hearth furnaces and can produce more than one million tons of steel annually.
    Romania Massively Exploits and Utilizes Natural Gas
    Romania's natural gas extraction has increased eightfold since liberation in 1944, reaching 3.9 billion cubic meters. By the end of this year, the consumption of natural gas by industry and residents will increase to thirteen times the pre-liberation level of 1938.
    Currently, major cities and industrial centers in Romania are receiving increasing amounts of natural gas. In the Cluj and Stalin regions, more than 70,000 homes have been supplied with natural gas.
    To expand the supply of natural gas, the total length of natural gas pipelines built throughout Romania has tripled since 1944. Natural gas pipelines between major industrial centers are being vigorously laid.
    Due to the increase in natural gas extraction, Romania's methane chemical industry has also greatly developed. By the end of this year, its production of carbon black and ammonia will reach thirteen times the level of 1938.
    Bulgarian Industrial Enterprises Improve Labor Productivity
    More than 3,100 factories and construction enterprises across Bulgaria have participated in the campaign to improve labor productivity and reduce costs. This campaign was initiated and launched at the beginning of this year by twenty-five advanced enterprises in the city and province of Sofia.
    In recent days, participating enterprises have frequently reported production successes. For example, the Karl Marx Soda Factory has completed 130 percent of its labor productivity improvement plan for the first half of this year. Product costs have been reduced by 55 percent, saving the state more than 43 million leva (Bulgarian currency) in funds. The largest textile enterprise in the country, the Vera Pieva Factory in Ruse, has overproduced more than 133,200 meters of cloth in the past few months, saving the state more than 280 million leva.

    苏联和人民民主国家的工业建设
    苏联创制放射线自动制动器
    一种在铁路运输中利用放射能的自动制动器，正在苏联试验中。这种新设备能够使列车在红色信号灯前面自动停止，完全避免撞车的危险。
    这种制动器由两个部分组成：在火车头上装置的丙种射线感应器，在铁路上装置的丙种射线放射器。这种设备只有在红色信号灯亮着的时候才发生作用。当列车行经信号灯前而信号灯发出红光时，丙种射线放射器中的放射性钴，就发生一股人眼看不到的丙种射线，向火车头上装置的丙种射线感应器射去，这时，丙种射线在感应器中转变成一股电流，制动器就开动起来，使列车停止下来。
    苏联制造许多新式重型机器
    苏联重型机器制造业正在制造和设计许多力量强大的新式重型机器。
    斯维德洛夫斯克乌拉尔重型机器制造厂创制的一台巨大的自动移动挖掘机，它的运土斗的容量有二十立方公尺，一昼夜可以挖土一万五千公方，如果用人工来挖这些土方，就需要一万多人。现在，这个工厂还在制造一种运土斗容量达二十五立方公尺、起重臂长度达一百公尺的大挖掘机。
    波多尔斯克的奥尔忠尼启则工作母机制造工厂已经开始制造苏联第一个超高温高压单流式锅炉，这种锅炉的蒸汽压力预计为二百三十个大气压，蒸汽发生时的温度将达到五百七十五度。
    波兰钢产量六年增加一倍
    今年，波兰钢产量将达到四百五十万吨，约相当于六年计划（一九五零—一九五五年）开始前一九四九年产量（二百三十万吨）的两倍。从一九五零年到现在，新建和改建的高炉超过十五座，平炉有三十座以上。
    在六年计划期间兴建的有波兰全国最大的两个钢铁企业——列宁冶金联合企业和贝鲁特钢铁工厂。现在，列宁冶金联合企业已经有四座现代化平炉和两座巨型高炉投入生产。它全部建成后，每年可产钢一百五十万吨，比战前波兰全国钢产量还要多。贝鲁特钢铁工厂已经建成了六个现代化的平炉，它每年可出产一百多万吨钢。
    罗大量开采和利用天然气
    罗马尼亚天然气的开采量已经增加到一九四四年解放时的八倍，达到了三十九亿立方公尺。到今年年底，工业和居民对于天然气的消费量将增加到解放前一九三八年的十三倍。
    目前，罗马尼亚国内各大城市和工业中心所得到的天然气越来越多。在克罗什州和斯大林州，得到天然气供应的住宅共达七万多所。
    为了扩大天然气的供应，罗马尼亚全国各地建设的天然气输送管道的总长度比一九四四年增加了三倍。各大工业中心之间的天然气输送管道正在大力铺设中。
    由于天然气开采量的增加，罗马尼亚的甲烷化学工业也大大发展了。到今年年底以前，它所生产的炭黑和氨将达到一九三八年的十三倍。
    保工业企业提高劳动生产率
    保加利亚全国已经有三千一百多个工厂和建筑企业参加了争取提高劳动生产率和减低成本的运动。这个运动是今年年初由索非亚市和州的二十五个先进企业倡议和发起的。
    近些天来，参加运动的企业纷纷传来生产捷报。例如，卡尔·马克思制碱工厂，已经完成了今年上半年提高劳动生产率计划的百分之一百三十，产品成本降低了百分之五十五，共为国家节约了四千三百多万列弗（保币）的资金。全国规模最大的纺织企业——鲁西市的维拉·皮耶娃工厂，在过去几个月中超计划生产了十三万三千二百多公尺的布匹，为国家节约了两亿八千多万列弗。（据新华社讯）
