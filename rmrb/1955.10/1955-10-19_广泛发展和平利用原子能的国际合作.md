Extensive Development of International Cooperation in the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy
Researcher, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhao Zhongyao

    Based on the resolution of the Ninth United Nations General Assembly in 1954, the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy was held in Geneva this August. At that conference, scientists from various countries exchanged views and information on the peaceful uses of atomic energy in a spirit of full cooperation. This not only made a valuable contribution to the development of science and technology for the peaceful use of atomic energy but also helped to ease international tensions.

    Currently, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly is discussing the issue of the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Soviet representative has already put forward a specific proposal at the meeting for developing international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. It is regrettable that China's seat in the United Nations has not been restored due to the obstruction of certain countries and it cannot participate in the discussion; however, since the discussion of this issue is of great significance to world peace and human welfare, peace-loving people all over the world are satisfied that international consultations have already begun on this issue and earnestly hope that the discussion can achieve positive results.

    Human survival has always directly or indirectly relied on energy from the sun. Since scientists discovered the phenomenon of atomic nuclear fission and thermonuclear reactions, mankind has obtained a method to utilize a huge amount of energy stored within the earth itself, which is the well-known atomic energy – that is, nuclear energy. The storage of atomic energy on Earth is very abundant. The utilization of atomic energy can infinitely expand the capacity of human activities, greatly improve our lives, and raise our culture. Therefore, we must fully estimate the impact that the peaceful use of atomic energy can produce and the beautiful prospects it can create in the future, and prevent this huge energy from being used again as a weapon to kill human beings.

    There are two ways to release atomic energy. One way is the transformation of the atomic nucleus, which emits radiation at the same time. The other way is the fission or fusion of the atomic nucleus, which releases huge amounts of energy that can be used to generate power. The atomic nuclei formed by fission must also undergo a series of transformations to become stable. Therefore, they continuously emit radiation. These radioactive elements are the radioactive isotopes that are currently widely used.

    The importance of atomic energy power stations is well known to everyone. It is especially worth noting that, thanks to the efforts of Soviet scientists and engineers, the technology of this type of power station has reached a fairly advanced level, and it can work for a long time without obstacles, and it does not pose a threat to the safety of workers and nearby residents. At the same time, in the Soviet Union, radioactive isotopes have been widely used in science, technology, agriculture, and medicine. For example, the study of metabolism and photosynthesis in biochemistry, the adjustment and control of machinery and the detection of defects in metal products in industry, the study of foliar fertilization and the elimination of pests in agriculture, and the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and tumors in medicine all use the method of tracer atoms or the effect of radiation. Due to the application of radioactive isotopes, some scientific and technological problems that could not be solved in the past have been solved, the operation procedures in industry can be greatly shortened or simplified, the yield of crops can be greatly increased in agriculture, many new treatment methods can be obtained in medicine, and a large number of patients can be treated in a short period of time.

    The convening of the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy has enabled everyone to gain richer knowledge and clearer insights into the peaceful use of atomic energy. International cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy has received increasing attention. As the Indian representative Menon stated in the United Nations General Assembly, the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy should serve as an example for implementing international cooperation in other areas. The public in various countries further realizes that international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy is an important step in consolidating peace and promoting human well-being.

    The Soviet Union has always advocated the peaceful use of atomic energy and the development of international cooperation in this area. In June of last year, the world's first atomic energy power station started supplying electricity in the Soviet Union. In January of this year, the Soviet government issued a statement deciding to help China and six other People's Democratic countries establish scientific experimental centers for atomic energy in order to develop research on the peaceful use of atomic energy, and intended to extend this assistance to other countries in need. At this year's Geneva International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, the Soviet representative's report on the peaceful use of atomic energy in the Soviet Union was praised by representatives from various countries. However, the development of international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy is inseparable from the prohibition of atomic weapons. That is why, in the current Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet delegation once again put forward a proposal for developing international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy and prohibiting the use and manufacture of atomic weapons.

    The peaceful use of atomic energy is not a vague fantasy in our country. With the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, our country will surely achieve remarkable achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy in the future. The speed of our socialist industrialization will be greatly increased due to the application of radioactive isotopes. Our power grid will be infinitely developed due to the application of atomic energy. We will also gradually use atomic energy to conquer nature. We need new technological exchanges, and we also need a stable international environment. The Chinese people will strive to promote international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    At present, although the forces of peace have promoted the easing of international tensions, no agreement has yet been reached among the major powers on the issue of disarmament. The recent meeting of the defense ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries in Paris is still discussing the issue of the use of atomic weapons. Therefore, we fully support the Soviet Union's proposal at the current Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the peaceful use of atomic energy and the prohibition of atomic weapons. We hope that the governments of all countries will maintain and develop the spirit demonstrated by the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference, so that international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy can be further developed, and agreements on the prohibition of atomic weapons can be reached quickly.

    广泛发展和平利用原子能的国际合作
    中国科学院物理研究所研究员　赵忠尧
    根据一九五四年第九届联合国大会的决议，今年八月在日内瓦召开了和平利用原子能的国际会议，在那次会议上，各国科学家以充分合作的精神交换了和平利用原子能方面的意见和情报。这不但对和平利用原子能的科学和技术的发展作了宝贵的贡献，而且有助于国际紧张局势的缓和。
    现在，联合国大会政治委员会正在讨论和平利用原子能问题，苏联代表已经在会上提出了一个发展和平利用原子能方面的国际合作的具体建议。由于某些国家的阻挠，我国在联合国中的席位还没有恢复，不能参加讨论，这是一个遗憾；但是由于这一问题的讨论，对于世界和平和人类福利具有重大的意义，全世界爱好和平的人士都因为已经就这个问题开始了国际的协商而感到满意，并殷切期望讨论能够达成积极的结果。
    人类的生存一向直接或者间接依靠着来自太阳的能量。自从科学工作者发现了原子核分裂现象和热核反应的现象以后，人类就获得了方法来利用地球本身所蕴藏的一种巨大的能量，这就是大家所熟知的原子能——也就是原子核能。地球上原子能的蕴藏非常丰富。原子能的利用能够无限地扩大人类活动的能力，可以大大改善我们的生活，提高我们的文化。因此，我们必须充分估计和平利用原子能所能产生的影响和它在未来所能造成的美景，并且防止这种巨大的能量不再被利用来作为残杀人类的武器。
    原子能的释放有二种方式，一种方式是原子核的转变，同时发出放射线。另一种方式是原子核的分裂或者合并，同时放出巨大的能量，这种能量可以用来产生动力。分裂所成的原子核，也要经过一系列的转变才能稳定下来。所以它们又连续发出放射线。这些有放射性的元素，就是目前广泛应用着的放射性同位素。
    原子能电力站的重要，已为大家所周知。尤其值得注意的是，由于苏联科学家和工程师的努力，目前这种电力站的技术已达到相当完善的程度，可以长期工作而不发生障碍，并且也不对工作人员以及附近居民的安全产生威胁。同时，在苏联，放射性同位素已在科学上、技术上、农业上和医疗上广泛地应用着。例如生物化学上新陈代谢和光合作用的研究，工业上器械的调节和控制以及金属制品缺陷的探测，农业上的根外追肥和消除虫害的研究，医学上癌症和肿瘤的诊断和治疗，都应用着示踪原子的方法或者射线的作用。由于放射性同位素的应用，科学上和技术上从前不能解决的若干问题已得到了解决，在工业上可以大大缩短或是简化操作的程序，在农业上可以大量增加作物的产量，在医疗上获得不少新的治疗方法，并且可以在短期内治疗大量的病人。
    和平利用原子能国际会议的召开，使大家获得关于和平利用原子能的更丰富的知识和更明确的见解。和平利用原子能的国际合作，已受到越来越多的注意。正如印度代表梅农在联合国大会中所表示的，和平利用原子能国际会议，应当作为在其他方面实行国际合作的范例。各国公众进一步认识到和平利用原子能的国际合作，是巩固和平和增进人类幸福的一个重要的步骤。
    苏联向来主张和平利用原子能和发展这方面的国际合作。去年六月，全世界第一座原子能电力站首先在苏联开始供电。今年一月苏联政府发表声明，决定帮助我国和其他六个人民民主国家建立原子能的科学实验中心，以发展和平利用原子能的研究，并且打算推广这种援助于其他有需要的国家。在今年的日内瓦和平利用原子能国际会议中，苏联代表所作的有关苏联和平利用原子能的报告受到与会各国代表的赞扬。但是，发展原子能和平利用的国际合作，是和禁止原子武器分不开的。这就是为什么在目前联合国大会政治委员会中，苏联代表团再一次地提出了发展和平利用原子能国际合作和禁止原子武器的使用与制造的提案。
    和平利用原子能在我国并不是一个虚茫的幻想。在苏联无私的帮助下，我国今后在和平使用原子能方面，一定能够获得显著的成就。我们社会主义工业化的速度将因放射性同位素的施用而大大提高。我们的电力网将因原子能的应用而得到无限的发展。我们也将逐步利用原子能来征服自然。我们需要新的技术的交流，我们也需要安定的国际环境。中国人民将努力促进和平使用原子能方面的国际合作。
    目前，爱好和平的力量虽然促使国际紧张局势趋于缓和，但是裁减军备问题仍未能在大国间取得协议。最近在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团各国国防部长会议还在讨论原子武器的使用问题。所以我们完全拥护苏联在这次联合国大会政治委员会上提出的和平利用原子能和禁止原子武器的提案。我们希望各国政府维护和发展日内瓦四国政府首脑会议所表现的精神，使各国在和平利用原子能方面的国际合作能够获得进一步的发展，并迅速就禁止原子武器问题达成协议。
