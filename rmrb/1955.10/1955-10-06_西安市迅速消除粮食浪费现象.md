Xi'an City Rapidly Eliminates Food Waste
Xin Ke

Xi'an City officially implemented a system of fixed grain rationing on September 1st. Since the implementation of rationing, the market has stabilized, order has been good, and the phenomenon of wasting grain is being rapidly eliminated. In September, the population of Xi'an City increased by 2.08% compared to August, while the grain supply decreased by 3.43%. Average per capita monthly grain consumption dropped from 21 jin 12 liang before rationing to 21 jin 4 liang. At the beginning of the work, some residents felt that the rationing standard was tight and feared it would not be enough to eat. In addition, a small number of bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, which further increased the masses' anxiety. Therefore, some blindly shouted "not enough to eat" without actual calculation; others knew it was enough, but deliberately said "not enough to eat" because they feared it would be inconvenient to have relatives and friends over for meals after the implementation of rationing.

In response to these situations, Xi'an City, through various means, deeply publicized the great achievements of the state's unified purchase and sale of grain over the past two years, publicized the benefits of implementing fixed grain rationing, enlightened and educated residents to obey the state plan, and established a habit of cherishing grain. For residents who were concerned that it was "not enough to eat," in addition to explaining the reasons to them, they were also helped to calculate the detailed accounts of their actual monthly grain consumption in the past, explaining that the rationing standard for residents was in line with the actual grain consumption of general residents. For some residents whose rationing standard was slightly lower than their past actual grain consumption, they were helped to check the phenomenon of waste in grain consumption in the past, explaining that as long as they are careful and thrifty, overcome waste, eat and use grain in a planned way, and make slight adjustments, it is still enough to eat. For residents who feared that it would be inconvenient for guests to eat after the implementation of grain rationing, it was explained that the method of using grain coupons for grain consumption does not hinder guests from eating. After such publicity and education, and cracking down on the rumors and sabotage of bad elements, many residents' doubts were dispelled, and a group of activists who saved grain emerged from the masses. Many residents automatically checked the phenomenon and reasons for wasting grain in the past, and some even used scales and bowls to measure and test the amount of grain needed for each day and each meal, and formulated a monthly grain consumption plan.

However, there are still some people who have various confused ideas. Some falsely report their labor situation; others falsely report the age of their children. In order to truly impress the significance and benefits of fixed grain rationing on people's hearts, it was further deepened into various streets, lanes, and courtyards, and various forums were held separately for women and industrialists and merchants. The real people and real things of wasting and saving grain in their own streets and courtyards were used to carry out publicity and education to the masses, and the experience and methods of other residents in formulating grain saving plans were introduced, further dispelling the various concerns among the residents. Among the 267 households in Baishulin Street, 213 households have formulated family grain saving plans. Wang Suiwen's family, residents of this street, has eight people. In the past, due to frequent temporary visits by guests and unplanned cooking, they had to buy more than 200 jin of grain every month. Now, according to the rationing standard, they should buy 189 jin per month, which is more than 40 jin less than the actual amount of grain they bought in the past. It seems a little tight, but after careful calculation, in addition to collecting grain coupons from guests for meals in the future, Wang Suiwen also formulated a monthly adjustment method for various meals. According to the results of the plan test, only five and a half to six and a half jin of grain are needed every day, and all eight people in the family can eat very full and very well. In this way, the grain purchased according to the rationing standard is not only enough to eat, but also can save six and a half jin of grain per month.

According to the experience of fixed grain rationing in Xi'an City, to do this work well, the following issues must be paid attention to.

First, correctly classify the supply grades of the urban population. Xi'an City had previously classified the population grades with fixed occupations and fixed labor in the city. In the actual grading work, many specific problems were also encountered. For example, to which grade should various peddlers and individual handicraft workers who are not separated from industry and commerce or have slight labor, as well as those engaged in pulling carts to sell water, digging wells, and clearing wells, be classified? Later, according to the opinions of the masses, the method of comparing labor differences was adopted. That is: for the grades of peddlers selling kerosene, soy sauce, vinegar, vegetables, eggs, and collecting scraps, those who engage in year-round long-distance sales in urban and rural areas are classified as the same supply grade as shop assistants; those who engage in unfixed short-distance sales in the city are classified as general residents; some individual handicraft workers who are not separated from industry and commerce or have slight labor (such as making toothbrushes, brushes, and uppers) are also classified as shop assistants; those who pull carts to sell water, dig wells, and clear wells are classified as light manual laborers; those who set up stalls to write letters, fortune tellers, monks, Taoists, and nuns are classified as general residents. After such a division, it is generally appropriate, and the masses are very satisfied.

Second, properly arrange the grain consumption of industrial and commercial industries. There are a total of 4,322 households and 8,490 employees in the five industries of cooked food, reproduction, food, non-staple food, and brewing in Xi'an City. In the past, due to the grain authorities' insufficient grasp of the production and sales of these industries, the amount of grain allocated for raw materials was too wide, resulting in a lot of waste and the disguised outflow of grain. In order to plug this loophole, while carrying out fixed grain rationing, the grain consumption of these industries was investigated household by household, and according to past production and sales and market needs, the spirit of overall planning and thrift, the required amount was calculated on a monthly average basis, and the supply was adjusted according to the peak and off-seasons. The required grain for replicated products such as sliced noodles, dried noodles, and rice noodles is purchased with grain coupons, and it is stipulated that they should contract the processing themselves, and the state will no longer supply raw grain separately; when replication operators have difficulties in contracting processing business at the beginning, the state can first supply a certain amount of grain without coupons, and they can sell their own products and collect grain coupons for turnover.

Third, after the implementation of fixed grain rationing, collective meal units must correspondingly improve meal management. The facts of many units have proved that the "meal package system" of meal management is no longer suitable for today's needs. Because in the units that package meals, the management and use of grain is almost entirely the responsibility of the meal management personnel, and few people who eat pay attention to saving grain and meal management, which inevitably leads to some waste of grain. The Xi'an Telecommunications Bureau of Shaanxi Province changed the "stove package system" to a canteen system on September 1st, eating with coupons. People who eat can get a bowl of rice weighing about twelve liang net by handing in a "rice coupon", which is very convenient. In this way, everyone can use their grain in a planned way, and the meal management personnel have more time and energy to improve the meals. Later, the average daily grain consumption of the entire stove of more than 500 people was more than 90 jin less than that of the "stove package system". This method is currently being promoted in Xi'an City.

### 西安市迅速消除粮食浪费现象

    西安市迅速消除粮食浪费现象 
    辛克
    西安市从九月一日起，正式实行粮食定量供应办法。实行定量供应以后，市场稳定，秩序良好，浪费粮食的现象正在迅速消除。九月份西安市人口比八月份增加了百分之二点零八，而粮食供应量则比八月减少百分之三点四三，每人每月平均消费粮食由定量前的二十一斤十二两降为二十一斤四两。工作开始，有些居民认为定量标准紧，怕不够吃；加上少数坏分子乘机造谣、破坏，更增加了群众的紧张心理。因此，有的没有经过实际计算就盲目叫喊“不够吃”；有的明知够吃，但怕实行定量供应后，来个亲戚朋友吃饭不方便，也故意说“不够吃”。
    针对这些情况，西安市通过各种方式，深入地宣传了两年来国家实行粮食统购统销的伟大成就，宣传了实行粮食定量供应的好处，启发和教育居民群众服从国家计划，树立爱惜粮食的风气。对于顾虑“不够吃”的居民，除给他们讲道理外，还帮助他们算了过去每月实际消费粮食的细账，说明对居民的定量标准是切合一般居民实际吃粮情况的。对一些定量标准量比过去实际用粮稍低的居民，帮助他们检查了过去在吃粮中的浪费现象，说明只要精打细算，克服浪费，有计划地吃用，再略加调剂，仍然是够吃的。对于怕实行定量供应后来客吃饭不方便的居民，说明实行粮票用粮的办法，并不妨碍来客吃饭。经过这样的宣传教育，并打击坏分子的造谣破坏后，许多居民的疑虑消除了，从群众中出现了一批节约粮食的积极分子。不少居民自动检查过去浪费粮食的现象和原因，还有的用秤称、碗量，试验每天和每顿饭的需粮量，订出全月用粮计划。
    但是，仍然有一部分人有各种糊涂思想。有的假报劳动情况；有的虚报小孩年龄。为了使粮食定量供应的意义和好处真正深入人心，又进一步深入到各个街巷和院落，分别召开妇女和工商业者等各种座谈会。用本街本院落浪费和节约粮食的真人真事，向群众进行宣传教育，介绍其他居民订节约用粮计划的经验和办法，进一步打消了居民中的种种顾虑。柏树林街二百六十七户居民中，有二百一十三户订了家庭节约用粮计划。这条街的居民王燧文家有八口人，过去由于家庭经常临时来客吃饭，加上平常作饭没计划，每月总得买二百多斤粮食。现在按定量标准计算，每月应买一百八十九斤，比过去每月实买粮数减少了四十多斤。似乎有些紧，但经过精打细算，除去今后来客吃饭收取粮票外，王燧文还订出了每月各种饭食调剂办法，按照计划试验的结果，每天只需五斤半到六斤半粮食，全家八口就能吃得很饱很好。这样按定量标准买的粮食，不但够吃，每月还可以节约六斤半粮食。
    根据西安市粮食定量供应的经验，要做好这一工作，必须注意以下几个问题。
    第一、正确划分城市人口的供应等别。西安市事前曾对全市职业固定和劳动固定的人口等别，进行了分类。在实际划分等别工作中，也遇到了不少具体问题。例如，各种担挑商贩和工商不分或有轻微劳动的个体手工业者，以及从事拉车卖水、挖井、掏井等职业的人口，究应划分在那一等别？后来根据群众意见，采取对比劳动差别的办法，这就是：对卖煤油、酱油、香醋、蔬菜、鸡蛋及收破烂等担挑商贩的等别，凡从事常年性的城乡长途贩卖者，都划为同店员一样的供应等级；凡从事不固定的市内短途贩卖者，都划为一般居民类；对一些工商不分或轻微劳动的个体手工业者（如做牙刷、毛笔、上鞋等），也都划为店员类；对拉车卖水、挖井、掏井者，都划为轻体力劳动者；对设摊写书信者、摆卦摊及和尚、道士、尼姑，均划为一般居民类。经过这样划分以后，一般是合适的，群众都很满意。
    第二、妥善安排工商行业用粮。西安市熟食、复制、食品、副食品、酿造五个行业，共有四千三百二十二户、八千四百九十名从业人员。过去由于粮食主管机关对这些行业的产销情况掌握不够，以致原料用粮核定供应量偏宽，造成不少浪费和粮食变相外流的现象。为了堵塞这方面的漏洞，在进行粮食定量供应的同时，对这些行业的用粮，经过逐户调查之后，根据以往产销情况和市场需要，本统筹兼顾和节约粮食的精神，采取按月平均计算需要量，以淡旺季节调剂供应的办法，分业逐户进行了核定。切面、挂面、米粉等复制品所需用粮，因实行凭粮票购买，规定了由其自行承揽加工，国家不再另行供应原料粮食；复制业户开始承揽加工业务有困难时，国家可以先免票供应一定数量的粮食，由他们自行出售产品，收取粮票以资周转。
    第三、在实行粮食定量供应以后，集体伙食单位必须相应地改进伙食管理。很多单位的事实证明，“包饭制”的伙食管理办法已不适合今天的需要了。因为在包饭的单位，粮食的管理和使用，几乎完全要由伙食管理人员负责，吃饭人很少过问节约粮食和伙食管理的事，这样，必然产生一些浪费粮食的现象。陕西省西安电信局从九月一日起把“包灶制”改为食堂制，凭券吃饭，吃饭人交一张“米饭券”，就可以拿到一碗净重十二两左右的饭，十分便利。这样，每个人都可以有计划地使用自己的粮食，伙食管理人员便有更多的时间和精力去改进伙食。以后，全灶五百多人，平均每日粮食消费量就比“包灶制”时减少九十多斤。目前西安市正在推广这种办法。
