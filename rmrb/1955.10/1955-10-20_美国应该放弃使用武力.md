In his speech on October 10, U.S. Secretary of State Mr. Dulles said that "military force should not be used offensively to achieve national purposes." He said that this is the principle that the United States adheres to in its foreign policy; he also asked China to accept this principle of "renouncing the use of force."

Since the Four Power Summit Conference in Geneva this July, people all over the world have been eagerly waiting for the U.S. government to take concrete steps to realize the spirit of the Geneva Conference. If Dulles' speech means that the United States will take practical actions to prove that it is willing to abide by the principles of the United Nations Charter in international relations and not use threats or force to infringe upon the territorial integrity or political independence of any country, it will be welcomed by people all over the world. The Chinese people will be the first to welcome it. However, judging from the other parts of Dulles' speech, this hope has not received any support.

On the contrary, in his speech, Dulles even described the U.S. military's occupation of China's territory Taiwan as an "indispensable contribution" to maintaining peace. He even described the great revolutionary victory of the Chinese people as a violation of the principle of "renouncing the use of force." It is as if the United States can arbitrarily use force to occupy China's territory, while the Chinese people should abandon their right to exercise their sovereignty and liberate their territory. What a strange logic!

Since its establishment, the People's Republic of China has always advocated the peaceful settlement of international disputes without resorting to force in its international relations; China has always opposed the use of force or the threat of force to infringe upon the territorial integrity and political independence of any country. China's actions in international affairs fully demonstrate that China is faithful to this peaceful foreign policy.

Contrary to the slanders made by Dulles in his speech, it was only because the U.S. military occupied Taiwan, invaded Korea, and further threatened China's security that the Chinese people were forced to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend their motherland; and China's contribution to the armistice in Korea is universally recognized. At the same time, everyone also knows that it was the United States itself that adopted the policy of armed intervention and expansion of the war in Indochina; and the contribution China made to the armistice in Indochina cannot be denied even by the United States. China, together with India and Burma, initiated the Five Principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, and established friendly and cooperative relations with many countries on the basis of these five principles. China also joined other Asian and African countries in passing resolutions at the Asian-African Conference to further affirm and develop these principles as principles guiding relations between countries. China advocates the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the realization of the peaceful reunification of Korea through free nationwide elections by the North and South Korean people without external interference. China advocates that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the responsible authorities in South Vietnam should hold consultations in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords in order to achieve the peaceful reunification of Vietnam through free nationwide elections. The Chinese government further advocates convening a Far East conference with the broad participation of Asian countries to seek peaceful solutions to these and other pressing Far East issues. These are all universally known facts.

Taking Sino-U.S. relations as an example, China has long stated its willingness to establish and develop diplomatic relations with any country, including the United States, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. After the Asian-African Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai further stated that the government of the People's Republic of China is willing to establish normal relations, peaceful coexistence, and friendly cooperation with all countries, including the United States, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Asian-African Conference. Premier Zhou Enlai has also repeatedly made it clear that the Chinese people do not want to fight with the United States; in order to ease the tension in the Taiwan area, China and the United States should sit down and negotiate. The Chinese side's proposal for higher-level Sino-U.S. talks during the Sino-U.S. talks also fully demonstrates the Chinese side's position of striving for a peaceful settlement of Sino-U.S. disputes without resorting to force.

As for the Chinese people exercising their sovereignty and liberating their territory Taiwan, that is China's internal affair, which does not allow any country to interfere. This is a universally recognized principle in international law. American international law scholar Goodridge and Norwegian international law scholar Hambro clearly pointed out in their co-authored "United Nations Charter": "Civil war is obviously a domestic issue. Any intervention by a foreign country or a foreign group to influence the course of the struggle constitutes an infringement on the independence of that country." The United States itself also upheld this principle during the Civil War. In March 1863, both houses of the U.S. Congress passed a resolution stating that the United States in the Civil War "enjoys complete freedom from foreign interference, which freedom is the supreme right of an independent country." The resolution also declared that the United States' "unchangeable purpose is to fight resolutely... until the rebellion is settled." It can be seen that domestic disputes and international disputes are fundamentally different in nature and must not be confused.

However, even in China's great liberation war, the Chinese people have always strived for peaceful liberation. Anyone who has not lost his sanity must admit that the Chinese people's liberation of Tibet is a very good example of peaceful liberation. As for the liberation of Taiwan, the Chinese government has also stated that there are two possible ways for the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, namely, the way of war and the way of peace. The Chinese people are willing to strive to liberate Taiwan peacefully under possible conditions. However, the liberation of Taiwan is entirely China's sovereignty and internal affair, and the United States has no right to interfere.

Taiwan is China's territory. Solemn international agreements signed by the United States, including the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, have clear provisions on this. On January 5, 1950, then U.S. President Mr. Truman also publicly stated, "For the past four years, the United States and other allies have also recognized China's exercise of sovereignty over the island. ...The U.S. government does not intend to follow any path that would involve the United States in China's internal strife." However, the United States has abandoned its own promises and occupied Taiwan with its military forces. The United States has established military bases on China's territory of Taiwan, armed and trained the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and is still frantically carrying out various activities attempting to sabotage and subvert the People's Republic of China. The United States has even openly clamored "to use the armed forces of the United States" to take "any necessary military action" to interfere with the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands. Is this not precisely using force or the threat of force to infringe upon China's territorial integrity and using military force to achieve the United States' aggressive purposes?

China has never used threats or force to infringe upon the territorial integrity of the United States. China has repeatedly stated that China and the United States should respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity and negotiate to resolve the disputes between the two countries. It is precisely because the United States uses force to occupy Taiwan and interfere with China's liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands that the tense situation in the Taiwan area has been created. If Mr. Dulles' so-called adherence to the principle of "renouncing the use of force" in foreign policy has any practical significance, the United States should abandon the use of force to infringe upon China's territorial integrity and make practical contributions to easing and eliminating the tension in the Taiwan area.

### 美国应该放弃使用武力

    美国应该放弃使用武力
    美国国务卿杜勒斯先生在十月十日的演说中说，“不应当进攻性地使用军事力量来达到国家的目的。”他说，这是美国在外交政策中所信守的原则；他还要求中国也接受这个“弃绝武力”的原则。
    自从今年七月四国政府首脑在日内瓦举行会议以来，世界各国人民早已在殷切地等待着美国政府采取具体的步骤来实现日内瓦会议的精神。如果杜勒斯演说的意思是说，美国将以实际行动来证明它在国际关系上愿意遵守联合国宪章的原则，不使用威胁或武力侵犯任何国家的领土完整或政治独立，那将是世界各国人民所欢迎的。中国人民将首先表示欢迎。但是，从杜勒斯演说的其他部分来看，人们的这个希望并没有得到任何支持。
    相反地，杜勒斯在他的演说中竟把美国使用军事力量霸占中国领土台湾的行为说成是对维护和平的“不可少的贡献”。他甚至于还把中国人民伟大的革命胜利说成是违反了“弃绝武力”的原则。仿佛美国可以任意使用武力霸占中国的领土，中国人民却应该放弃行使自己的主权、解放自己的领土的权利。好一个奇怪的逻辑！
    中华人民共和国自从成立以来，在它的国际关系中，一向主张和平解决国际争端而不诉诸武力；中国一向反对以武力或武力威胁侵犯任何国家的领土完整和政治独立。中国在国际事务中的行动充分地证明了中国是忠实于这个和平的外交政策的。
    同杜勒斯在他的演说中所进行的诬蔑相反，只是由于美国的军队侵占台湾、侵入朝鲜并进一步威胁中国的安全，中国人民才被迫抗美援朝，保卫自己的祖国；而中国在促成朝鲜停战中的贡献是举世公认的。同时，大家也都知道，对印度支那战争采取武装干涉和扩大战争的政策的正是美国自己；而中国在促成印度支那停战中所作的贡献，就是美国也不能否认。中国同印度和缅甸一起倡导了互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则，并且在这五项原则的基础上同许多国家建立了友好合作的关系。中国还同其他亚非国家一起在亚非会议中通过决议，进一步肯定和发展了这些原则作为指导各国关系的原则。中国主张从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，让南北朝鲜人民在不受外来干涉的情况下经由全国自由选举实现朝鲜的和平统一。中国主张越南民主共和国和越南南方负责当局按照日内瓦协议的规定进行协商，以便通过全国自由选举来实现越南的和平统一。中国政府更主张召开有亚洲国家广泛参加的远东会议来谋求这些问题和其他迫切的远东问题的和平解决。这都是举世皆知的事实。
    就以中美两国关系来说，中国早已声明愿意根据平等、互利、互相尊重主权和领土完整的原则同任何国家，包括美国在内，建立和发展外交关系。亚非会议后，周恩来总理更表示，中华人民共和国政府愿意根据和平共处的五项原则以及亚非会议的十项原则同一切国家，包括美国在内，建立正常关系，和平共处，友好合作。周恩来总理并曾一再明确声明，中国人民并不要同美国打仗；为了和缓台湾地区的紧张局势，中美双方应该坐下来谈判。中美会谈中，中国方面所提出的举行更高一级中美谈判的主张，也充分地说明了中国方面争取和平解决中美两国争端而不诉诸武力的立场。
    至于中国人民行使自己的主权，解放自己的领土台湾，那是中国的内政，那是不容任何国家加以干涉的。这是国际法中公认的原则。美国的国际法学者古德里巨和挪威的国际法学者汉布罗在他们合著的“联合国宪章”一书中，就曾经明确指出：“内战显然是一个内政问题。一个外国或一个外国集团为要影响斗争的过程而进行的任何干涉，都构成对该国独立的侵犯。”美国自己在南北战争期间也曾经坚持过这一原则。一八六三年三月，美国国会两院通过决议，表示美国在内战中“享有不受外国干涉的完全自由，这种自由是独立国家的最高权利。”决议并宣称，美国的“不可改变的目的是坚决作战……直到叛乱底定为止。”可见国内争端和国际争端是性质根本不同的两回事，决不容许混为一谈。
    但是，就在中国伟大的解放战争中，中国人民也一贯争取和平解放的方式。任何人如果不是丧失了清醒的理智，就不能不承认中国人民解放西藏正是和平解放的一个很好的例证。就解放台湾来说，中国政府也曾声明，中国人民解放台湾有两种可能的方式，即战争的方式和和平的方式，中国人民愿意在可能的条件下，争取用和平的方式解放台湾。但是解放台湾完全是中国的主权和内政，美国没有任何权利过问。
    台湾是中国的领土。美国参加签订的庄严的国际协议，包括开罗宣言和波茨坦公告，对此都有着明确的规定。一九五○年一月五日当时美国总统杜鲁门先生也曾经公开声明，“过去四年来，美国和其他盟国也承认中国对该岛行使主权。……美国政府不拟遵循任何足以把美国卷入中国内争中的途径。”但是，美国背弃了它自己的诺言，以它的军事力量侵占了台湾。美国在中国的领土台湾上建立军事基地，武装和训练蒋介石集团的残余分子，至今还在疯狂地进行着种种企图破坏和颠覆中华人民共和国的活动。美国甚至于公开叫嚣“将使用美国的武装部队”，为干涉中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿采取“必需的任何军事行动”。这难道不正是以武力或武力威胁侵犯中国的领土完整，使用军事力量来达到美国的侵略目的吗？
    中国从来没有使用威胁或武力来侵犯美国的领土完整。中国一再声明，中美双方应该互相尊重主权和领土完整，协商解决两国的争端。正是因为美国使用武力霸占台湾，干涉中国解放台湾和沿海岛屿，才造成了台湾地区的紧张局势。如果杜勒斯先生所谓在外交政策中信守“弃绝武力”的原则有任何实际意义的话，美国就应该放弃使用武力侵犯中国领土完整，为和缓和消除台湾地区紧张局势作出实际的贡献。
