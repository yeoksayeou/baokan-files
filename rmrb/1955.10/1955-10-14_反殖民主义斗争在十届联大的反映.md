    The tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly has moved from the stage of discussing agenda items and general debates to the stage of discussing substantive issues. From the situation in the first stage, it can be seen that the anti-colonial struggle of the Asian and African people has received increasingly widespread support, and the colonialist forces are increasingly trapped in moral and political isolation. The Tenth UN General Assembly reflects the new developments in the anti-colonial struggle.

    In this stage, the struggle between the colonialist forces and the anti-colonialist forces revolved around the central issue of whether to include several major colonial issues on the agenda. Whether in the General Committee of the UN General Assembly or in the plenary session, Western colonial countries have used various excuses and means, including exerting pressure, to try to prevent the Tenth UN General Assembly from discussing the urgent issues of colonial people's demands for national independence and self-determination, as well as the important issues of safeguarding national sovereignty and respecting basic human rights. However, after a sharp struggle, several major colonial issues raised by Asian and African countries—the Moroccan question, the Algerian question, the West Irian question, the Palestinian question, and the South African racial discrimination question—were finally included on the agenda of the Tenth UN General Assembly. Although the Cyprus issue raised by the Greek government was vetoed under the control of Western colonial countries, it does not mean that this issue has been erased from the agenda of the UN General Assembly.

    In order to oppose the inclusion of colonial issues on the agenda, Western colonial countries repeatedly cited Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that the United Nations should not interfere in the internal affairs of member states, to defend themselves. They said that the United Nations' discussion of the Cypriot people's right to self-determination, the North African people's right to self-determination, the status of West Irian, or the South African apartheid policy, are all "direct and hostile interference" in the internal affairs of colonial countries and a "violation" of the United Nations Charter. However, it is well known that supporting the colonial people who are fighting heroically for their national independence, defending their legitimate rights, and safeguarding the sacred and inviolable human rights and fundamental freedoms are fully in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Especially when colonial countries use force to suppress the national liberation movements and self-determination demands of colonies and dependent countries, and seriously threaten the peace of the region and cause unrest in neighboring countries, the United Nations has the power and responsibility to take appropriate measures to promote a peaceful solution to the problem and meet the reasonable aspirations of the people of colonies and dependent countries.

    The representatives of Western colonial countries also put forward such reasons to oppose the UN General Assembly's discussion of colonial issues: that it is "inopportune" to discuss this issue at present, that it will not produce "beneficial results," and that it does not conform to the "Geneva spirit" of promoting international understanding and cooperation. It is as if the United Nations' consideration of the serious situation caused by colonialism in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter would "poison" the international atmosphere and "damage" the prestige of the United Nations, and would be what a representative of a certain Western colonial country called a "tragic mistake." Obviously, this argument not only completely violates the spirit of the United Nations Charter, but also completely distorts the actual situation.

    The various arguments of Western colonial countries in defense of their colonial interests and interventionist policies have been strongly refuted by anti-colonial countries, especially Asian and African countries. The representatives of Asian and African countries unanimously pointed out in their speeches that the legitimate demands of the people of colonies and dependent countries to defend their legitimate rights and national interests should be supported by the United Nations, and that Western colonial countries should be bound by the United Nations Charter. The issue of eliminating the scourge of colonialism is an important issue related to the dignity of the United Nations. Therefore, as the representative of the Burmese government said: "For colonial countries, the United Nations' discussion of this kind of issue is never opportune, but for the enslaved people, this discussion is always opportune."

    The representatives of Asian and African countries made a righteous condemnation of the Western colonial countries that attempted to continue to maintain colonial rule and oppression and evade the UN discussion. They condemned the colonialists for using violence to maintain the "alliance" with the colonial people, condemned the North Atlantic partners for carrying out colonial wars together, and condemned foreign conquest, domination, and exploitation as a denial of basic human rights, a violation of the United Nations Charter, and an obstacle to promoting world peace and cooperation. They conveyed the voices of the Asian and African colonial people striving for independence and freedom. The representative of Liberia said that the United Nations "cannot turn a deaf ear to the brutal extermination and inhuman treatment of local residents that is taking place in the northern part of the African continent." The colonialists were put on trial.

    In the first stage of the anti-colonial struggle at the Tenth UN General Assembly, Asian and African countries greatly promoted the spirit of the Asian-African Conference. They abide by the resolutions on "Human Rights and Self-determination," "The Problem of Dependent Peoples," and "Other Problems" in the final communique of the Asian-African Conference, and demonstrate with practical actions their willingness to work to implement the resolutions.

    The new development of the anti-colonial struggle is not only manifested in the fact that Asian and African countries brought the spirit of the Asian-African Conference to the United Nations, thus forming a great degree of unity of action, but also in the resistance of Latin American countries and member states of the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" to Western colonial countries. It is enough to cite the inclusion of the Algerian issue on the agenda. Everyone knows that obstructing the Tenth UN General Assembly from discussing the Algerian issue was an important goal of Western colonial countries. However, among the Latin American countries, six countries, including Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, and Uruguay, voted in favor of including this issue on the agenda, and two countries (El Salvador and Paraguay) abstained; among the member states of the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization," one country, Greece, voted in favor, and another country, Iceland, abstained. This is enough to illustrate that the influence of the anti-colonial forces represented by Asian and African countries in the United Nations is expanding, and the Western colonialists are becoming increasingly unpopular.

    Western colonial countries are in a very awkward and embarrassing position. The representatives of the US government, who are accustomed to pretending to oppose colonialism and sympathize with national independence, revealed their true colors in a helpless situation. In his lengthy speech at the United Nations General Assembly, US Secretary of State Dulles talked about various issues, but omitted the colonial issue, which is of concern to the vast majority of member states and people all over the world. This is of course not due to Dulles's negligence, but to his "unspeakable secret."

    The representative of the US government opposed including the urgent issue of the Algerian people facing new military suppression and bloody massacres on the agenda on the grounds that "Algeria is a province of the French Republic," and can never indicate that the US government sympathizes with the Algerian people's right to self-determination. West Irian is an inseparable part of the Republic of Indonesia, but the representative of the US government abstained on this issue, which is also not enough to show that the US government supports the legitimate demands of the Indonesian government and people for the recovery of West Irian.

    The US authorities, especially Dulles, have more than once expressed that the US government supports the results achieved by the Asian-African Conference. However, people want to ask: What similarities do the actions of the representatives of the US government in the United Nations have with the spirit of the various resolutions of the Asian-African Conference?

    On the Cyprus issue, the US attitude not only aroused the anger of the Greek government, but also aroused widespread criticism from international public opinion. The New York Times editorial admitted: "On the Cyprus issue, we not only support Britain ourselves, but also ask some of our Latin American neighbors to support Britain." It should also be pointed out that the US government threatened the Greek government before forcing several countries in the "Organization of American States" to vote against including the Cyprus issue on the agenda. According to the United Nations Charter, the United Nations has the right to grant Cyprus self-determination, but the representatives of the US government have exerted pressure inside and outside the United Nations to obstruct the United Nations from discussing this issue.

    The United States wants to play itself as "a strange character" in the United Nations, making people believe that it is not a colonialist or a supporter of colonialism. This attempt has completely failed. This is not surprising, because the essential difference between colonialism and anti-colonialism cannot be confused in any way.

    The Soviet government delegation advocated that the various colonial issues should be discussed in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, in accordance with the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, in accordance with the spirit of the anti-colonial resolutions of the Asian-African Conference, and taking into account the legitimate rights and national interests of the people of the countries concerned, in order to seek a proper solution. The Soviet government's attitude shows the Soviet people's consistent position of giving moral support and sympathy to the wishes of the people of all countries to seek national liberation.

    The inclusion of Asian and African colonial issues, especially the Algerian issue, on the agenda is a victory achieved by peace-loving and anti-colonial countries at the Tenth UN General Assembly. The issue of colonial rule and oppression is no longer the so-called "internal affair" of Western colonial countries, but is regarded as a serious international issue that harms the cause of peace and the United Nations Charter.

    This victory reflects the irresistible force of the people of all countries demanding an end to colonization and the eradication of the scourge of colonialism. Just as the representative of the Egyptian government pointed out in his speech condemning Western colonial countries: "Die-hard colonialism... does not want to recognize that its era has passed, and it does not want to recognize that it must withdraw, or it will be kicked out."

    反殖民主义斗争在十届联大的反映
    邵宗汉
    第十届联合国大会已经由议程问题的讨论和一般性辩论的阶段进入讨论实质问题的阶段了。人们从第一个阶段的情形可以看出，亚非人民的反殖民主义斗争得到了越来越广泛的支持，殖民主义势力日益陷于道义上和政治上的孤立。十届联大反映着反殖民主义斗争的新发展。
    在这一阶段中，殖民主义势力和反殖民主义势力的斗争是围绕着要不要把几个主要的殖民地问题列入议程这一中心进行的。不论是在联大的总务委员会中或者是在全体会议中，西方殖民国家曾经用各种借口和手段，包括行使压力在内，企图阻挠十届联大讨论殖民地人民要求民族独立和自决权利的迫切问题以及关于维护国家主权和尊重基本人权的重要问题。但是，亚非国家所提出的有关殖民主义的几个主要问题——摩洛哥问题、阿尔及利亚问题、西伊里安问题、巴勒斯坦问题、南非种族歧视问题等，经过尖锐的斗争后，终于被列入十届联大的议程。由希腊政府提出的塞浦路斯问题虽然在西方殖民国家的控制下遭到了否决，却并不意味着这个问题已从联大的议程上抹去。
    为了反对把殖民主义问题列入议程，西方殖民国家一再援引联合国宪章第二条的规定，即联合国不应当干涉成员国内政的规定，来替他们自己辩护。他们说，联合国讨论塞浦路斯人民的自决权利，讨论北非人民的自决权利，讨论西伊里安的地位问题或者讨论南非的种族隔离政策，都是对于殖民国家的内政的“直接的和敌意的干涉”，都是对于联合国宪章的“破坏”。然而，尽人皆知，支持为自己的民族独立而英勇斗争的殖民地人民，保卫他们的合法权利，维护神圣不可侵犯的人权和基本自由，是完全符合联合国宪章的宗旨和原则的。特别是当殖民国家行使武力来镇压殖民地和附属国的民族解放运动和自决要求，并严重地威胁到本地区的和平和引起邻国的不安时，联合国更有权力和责任采取适当的措施，促使问题的和平解决，满足殖民地和附属国人民的合理愿望。
    西方殖民国家的代表们还提出这样一些理由来反对联大讨论殖民地问题：目前就这个问题进行讨论是“不适时的”，是不会产生“有益的结果的”，是不符合促进国际间的谅解和合作的“日内瓦精神”的。仿佛联合国根据宪章的宗旨和原则考虑殖民主义所造成的严重情势，反而会“毒化”国际气氛，“损害”联合国的威信，反而像某一个西方殖民国家的代表所说的是什么“悲剧性的错误”。很明显，这种论点不仅完全违背联合国宪章的精神，也完全歪曲了实际的情况。
    西方殖民国家为自己的殖民利益和干涉政策作辩护的各种论调，遭到了反殖民主义国家尤其是亚非国家的有力驳斥。亚非国家的代表们在发言中一致指出，殖民地和附属国人民保卫合法权利和民族利益的正当要求应该得到联合国的支持，西方殖民国家应该受联合国宪章的约束。消除殖民主义祸害问题是有关联合国尊严的重要问题。因此，正如缅甸政府的代表所说：“对殖民国家来说，联合国讨论这种问题永远是不适时的，但是对于受奴役的人民来说，这种讨论总是适时的。”
    亚非国家的代表们对企图继续保持殖民统治和压迫并规避联合国讨论的西方殖民国家，作了正义的谴责。他们谴责殖民主义者用暴力来维持同殖民地人民的“联盟”，谴责北大西洋的伙伴一起进行殖民战争，谴责外国的征服、统治和剥削是对基本人权的否定、是对联合国宪章的违反、是对促进世界和平和合作的障碍。他们传达了争取独立和自由的亚非殖民地人民的声音。利比里亚的代表说，联合国“对于非洲大陆北部正在发生残酷消灭和非人地对待当地居民的情形不能充耳不闻”。殖民主义者受到了审判。
    亚非国家在十届联大第一个阶段的反殖民主义斗争中，大大地发扬了亚非会议的精神。他们遵守亚非会议最后公报中关于“人权和自决”、“附属地人民问题”和“其他问题”各项决议，以实际行动来证明他们愿意为实现各项决议而努力。
    反殖民主义斗争的新发展，不仅表现在亚非国家把亚非会议的精神带到联合国去，从而在极大程度上形成行动的一致，并且也表现在拉丁美洲国家和“北大西洋公约组织”成员国对西方殖民国家的抗拒上。只要举出阿尔及利亚问题被列入议程这一点就够了。大家知道，阻挠十届联大讨论阿尔及利亚问题，是西方殖民国家的一个重要目标。但是，在拉丁美洲国家中，却有阿根廷、玻利维亚、哥斯达黎加、危地马拉、墨西哥和乌拉圭等六个国家赞成把这个问题列入议程，并有两个国家（萨尔瓦多和巴拉圭）弃权；在“北大西洋公约组织”成员国中，却也有一个国家——希腊投票赞成，另一个国家——冰岛投弃权票。这就足以说明，在联合国内以亚非国家为代表的反殖民主义势力的影响是越来越扩大了，西方殖民主义者是越来越不得人心了。
    西方殖民国家处于十分尴尬和狼狈的地位。惯于假装反对殖民主义和同情民族独立的美国政府的代表们，在无可奈何的情况下暴露出自己的真面目。美国国务卿杜勒斯在联合国大会上所作的长篇的发言中，谈到了各方面的问题，却遗漏了为极大多数的会员国和全世界人民所关心的殖民主义问题。这当然不是由于杜勒斯的疏忽，而是由于他的“难言之隐”。
    美国政府的代表以“阿尔及利亚是法兰西共和国的一省”为理由而反对把阿尔及利亚人民正面临着新的军事镇压和血腥屠杀的迫切问题列入议程，决不能表示美国政府是同情阿尔及利亚人民的自决权利的。西伊里安是印度尼西亚共和国的不可分割的一部分，美国政府的代表却在这个问题上弃权，这也不足以表示美国政府是支持印度尼西亚政府和人民关于收复西伊里安的正当要求的。
    美国的当权人物，特别是杜勒斯，曾经不止一次地表示过，美国政府是赞成亚非会议所取得的结果的。但是，人们要问：美国政府的代表们在联合国内的行动跟亚非会议各项决议的精神，究竟有什么相似之处呢？
    在塞浦路斯问题上，美国的态度不仅引起希腊政府的愤怒，并且引起国际舆论的广泛指责。纽约时报的社论承认：“在塞浦路斯问题上，我们不仅自己支持英国，而且还要求我们的一些拉丁美洲邻国也支持英国。”还应该指出，美国政府在强使“美洲组织”的若干国家投票反对把塞浦路斯问题列入议程以前，曾对希腊政府进行了威胁。根据联合国宪章，联合国有权给塞浦路斯以自决权，而美国政府的代表们却在联合国内外行使压力，阻挠联合国讨论这个问题。
    美国想在联合国内把自己扮演成为“一个奇怪的角色”，使人们相信它自己不是殖民主义者或殖民主义的支持者。这个企图是完全失败了。这是毫不奇怪的，因为殖民主义和反殖民主义在本质上的区别，是无论如何也不能混淆的。
    苏联政府代表团对各项殖民主义问题主张根据联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，根据不干涉他国内政的原则，根据亚非会议有关反殖民主义各项决议的精神，并在照顾到有关各国人民的正当权利和民族利益的情况下，进行讨论，谋求正当解决的办法。苏联政府的态度表明苏联人民对各国人民求得民族解放的愿望给予道义支持和同情的一贯立场。
    亚非殖民主义问题特别是阿尔及利亚问题的列入议程，是爱好和平和反殖民主义的国家在十届联大所取得的一个胜利。殖民统治和压迫的问题再也不是西方殖民国家的所谓“内政问题”了，而被认为是损害和平事业和联合国宪章的具有严重国际意义的问题了。
    这一胜利反映各国人民要求结束殖民地化和根除殖民主义祸害的不可抗拒的力量。正像埃及政府的代表在谴责西方殖民国家的发言中指出：“死硬的殖民主义……并不想认识到，它的时代已经过去了，并且它也不想认识到，它必须退出，不然就被踢出去。”
