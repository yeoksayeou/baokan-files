    Yunnan Tea Purchase Plan Exceeds Target

    Yunnan Province has exceeded its annual tea purchase plan by 9%, an increase of more than 13,000 dan compared to last year. This year, most of the major tea-producing areas in Yunnan experienced timely rainfall, and the tea plants developed normally. Since the tea harvest began, news of increased production has been coming in from various places. The famous Fengqing export black tea region is estimated to have increased production by about 10%, and the tea purchase volume in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture has more than doubled compared to last year.

    To facilitate tea farmers' sales, the Yunnan Provincial Tea Company and supply and marketing cooperatives have established more purchasing stations and mobile purchasing teams in many major tea-producing areas, remote mountainous areas, and minority ethnic tea areas during the purchasing period. This has solved the difficulty for farmers selling small quantities of tea from afar, and ensured the completion of the state purchase plan. (Tang Zuhong)

    云南茶叶收购计划超额完成
    云南省茶叶收购工作已超额完成年度计划百分之九，比去年增加一万三千多担。今年云南各主要茶区大多雨水适时，茶叶发育正常。自茶叶开采以来，各地陆续传来增产消息。著名的凤庆出口红茶区，估计增产一成左右，西双版纳傣族自治州茶叶收购量比去年增加一倍以上。
    为了便利茶农出售茶叶，收购时，云南省茶业公司、供销合作社在许多主要产茶区、边远山区和少数民族茶区，增设了收购站和流动收购组。解决农民远道零星出售的困难，保证了国家收购计划的完成。　（唐祖闳）
