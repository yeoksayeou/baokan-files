    Grassland Survey Team Fighting in the Ili River Valley
    Xiao Du
    Since this summer, on the fertile and vast Tekes grassland in the Ili River Valley, a group of Kazakh, Uyghur, and Han youths have frequently appeared in the vast grasslands and the towering mountains of the Tianshan Mountains, carrying tents, luggage, dry food, and surveying instruments, enduring wind and sleeping in the open. Local herders all know that these are people who are searching for pastures and ranches for the people.
    This grassland survey team, composed of youths from various ethnic groups, has traveled through many unexplored grasslands in the Tekes pastoral area for more than two months. According to their survey, the grassland here is very vast. In the Kezike Kuoxitai grassland alone, the summer and winter pastures surveyed cover more than 340,000 mu, which can graze more than 127,000 livestock. However, only more than 60,000 livestock are grazing here now, and a large area of ​​grassland is left unused.
    In order to submit the grassland survey data as soon as possible, these young developers of the motherland's border areas climb mountains and cross rivers, and carry out the tasks entrusted to them by the people of the motherland under very difficult and arduous conditions. They often crawl along rugged and winding mountain paths to steep mountains with an altitude of four to five thousand meters above sea level to survey the complex grassland terrain. In the continuous deep mountains and boundless grasslands, they often cannot see a single herder's felt tent even after walking for a whole day. When they are hungry, they can only quench their hunger with cold and hard dry "nang" (a type of baked cake) soaked in mountain snow water. Sometimes when working in the high mountains, the heavy tent cannot be carried up, so they have to sleep in the open at night. The climate in the pastoral area changes greatly. The sun is scorching hot on the plains and grasslands; in the mountains, it sometimes snows heavily, and sometimes there are strong winds and heavy rains. The surveyors have more than once spent the night in deep mountain grasslands in torrential rain or wind and snow. But this extremely harsh natural condition did not scare them, nor did it make them waver or yield. The lofty will to develop and build the border areas of the motherland encouraged them to bravely overcome difficulties and move forward continuously, and always maintained a full and combative work enthusiasm.
    In more than two months of hard work, they not only worked tenaciously, but also studied tenaciously. Youth League member Abuljiang (Kazakh) was just an ordinary staff member in the local CPC district committee more than two months ago, but now he is a fairly skilled grassland surveyor. A large number of ethnic minority cadres in the survey team have begun to become familiar with and master the working methods and preliminary scientific and technical knowledge of grassland surveying.

    战斗在伊犁河谷的草原勘查队
    萧渡
    在富饶、辽阔的伊犁河谷平原的特克斯草原上，从今年夏天以来，有一群哈萨克、维吾尔和汉族青年，经常驮着帐篷，背着行李，带着干粮和测绘仪器，风餐露宿，出没在广阔的草原和天山山脉的崇山峻岭之间。当地的牧民都知道，这是在为人民寻找草场和牧场的人们。
    这支由各族青年组成的草原勘查队，两个多月以来，踏遍了特克斯牧区的许多人迹不到的草原。据他们勘查发现，这儿的草原非常辽阔，仅在克齐克阔西太这一处草原上勘查出的夏季和冬季牧场，就有三十四万多亩，可以牧放十二万七千多头牲畜，但现在只有六万多头牲畜在这儿牧放，闲置了大片草场没有利用。
    这些年轻的祖国边疆的开发者为了争取早日提交出草原勘查的资料，他们爬山渡水，在十分艰苦和困难的条件下，执行祖国人民托付的任务。他们经常沿着崎岖曲折的羊肠小道，爬行到拔海四、五千公尺的峻峭的高山上，测绘复杂的草原地形。在绵延不断的深山里和一望无边的大草原上，常常走一整天还看不到一顶牧民的毡房。饿了，他们只能用山间的雪水泡着冷硬的干“馕”（一种烤饼）充饥。有时在高山上工作，笨重的帐篷带不上去，晚上他们就只好睡在露天里。牧区的气候变化很大，在平地草原上太阳酷热；山里却时而下大雪，时而又是狂风暴雨。勘查者们不止一次夜间露宿在倾盆大雨或风雪交加的深山草原上。但这种极端恶劣的自然条件，没有把他们吓倒，没有使他们动摇和屈服。开发和建设祖国边疆的崇高意志，鼓舞着他们勇敢地不断克服困难前进，始终保持了饱满的、战斗的工作热情。
    在两个多月的艰苦工作中，他们不但顽强地工作，而且顽强地学习。青年团员阿布尔江（哈萨克族）两个多月以前还是当地中共区委会里一个普通工作人员，现在却是一个相当熟练的草原勘查工作者了。勘查队里很大一部分民族干部，都开始熟悉了、掌握了勘查草原的工作方法和初步的科学技术。
