The resolution said: "The Parliament considers this an interference in the internal affairs of an Arab sovereign state that freely follows a policy guided by its higher interests."

The resolution also stated: "The Parliament appreciates the attitude of those governments that help Arab countries purchase weapons and provide support on their other issues, and the Parliament requests the Syrian government to adopt a unified military policy in its armament policy that has no compromise or external interference in its implementation of full sovereignty."

Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch: TASS Paris Dispatch: According to an AFP correspondent in Beirut, the Lebanese Parliament unanimously expressed its welcome and approval of Egypt's decision to purchase weapons from Czechoslovakia on October 4th. The resolution praised the steadfastness and patriotism of Egyptian leaders.

Other Arab countries should follow Egypt's example in this regard."

"Al-Gomhuria" reported that Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Egypt, Al-Fadl, said: "No Arab country today should show hesitation in securing its weapons, regardless of where these weapons come from."

    决议还说：“议会感激那些帮助阿拉伯国家购买武器和在它们的其他问题上对它们给予支持的政府的态度，议会要求叙利亚政府在它的军备政策中采行一种在它实施充分的主权中没有任何妥协和外来干涉的统一的军事政策。”
