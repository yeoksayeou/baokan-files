    Shanghai Turbine Factory Workers Guarantee to Complete Annual Plan Ten Days Ahead of Schedule
    The entire staff of the state-owned Shanghai Turbine Factory recently proposed at a staff representative meeting to comprehensively complete this year's national plan and increased production and economy plan ten days ahead of schedule. On this basis, they further guaranteed to increase production of one 6,000-kilowatt turbine, which will strive to complete final assembly and testing by the end of the year.
    This year, the state assigned the Shanghai Turbine Factory the task of producing three 6,000-kilowatt turbines in small batches. The workers of the Shanghai Turbine Factory have completed this task three months ahead of schedule.
    On October 8, the Shanghai Turbine Factory held a staff representative meeting to summarize and evaluate the work of the third quarter. At this meeting, more than 500 staff representatives proposed a suggestion to increase production of one more 6,000-kilowatt turbine for the country. This suggestion was warmly supported by the factory's workers. Currently, all factory employees are formulating specific guarantee conditions for teams and individuals and are enthusiastically launching the fourth quarter labor competition to strive to achieve their guarantee conditions.
