Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 20th. The Vietnam Fatherland Front United Movement Committee and the Hanoi Municipal National United Front Congress Movement Committee jointly held a conference in Hanoi on the evening of October 19th to oppose the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's conspiracy to conduct a "referendum" in South Vietnam and to condemn the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's atrocities in creating the Huong Dien massacre.

Present at the conference were: Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, Hoang Quoc Viet, member of the Political Bureau of the Vietnam Labor Party and Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, Xuan Thuy, representative of the Vietnam Fatherland Front United Movement Committee, and representatives from various democratic parties and people from all walks of life in Hanoi, totaling 10,000 people.

Xuan Thuy delivered a report to the conference on behalf of the Vietnam Fatherland Front United Movement Committee. He pointed out that Ngo Dinh Diem's "referendum" is a new conspiracy manufactured by the United States, attempting to legitimize Ngo Dinh Diem's dictatorial regime through deceptive means, in order to establish a completely pro-American regime in the South to realize the United States' war policy. Thus, they conspire to further intensify the sabotage of the Geneva Accords, undermine Vietnam's unification, and then openly announce their formal accession to the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and prepare for war.

Xuan Thuy rebuked the Ngo Dinh Diem regime for continuously creating incidents of massacring the people in the South. At his suggestion, all the people attending the conference observed a minute of silence in deep sorrow for the ninety-two compatriots who were victims of the Huong Dien massacre.

Xuan Thuy concluded by saying that the people of both North and South Vietnam will unite more broadly to oppose the evil conspiracy of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

Following this, Nguyen Cong Hoa, representative of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, Nguyen Thi Van, who escaped from the Huong Dien massacre, and others spoke at the conference. They unanimously opposed Ngo Dinh Diem's conspiracy to conduct a "referendum" in the South and the atrocities of persecuting the people, and called on people from all walks of life to unite closely around the Fatherland Front and actively participate in the struggle to restore the economy and strive for unification.

Finally, the conference unanimously adopted a resolution opposing Ngo Dinh Diem's conspiracy to conduct a "referendum" and the atrocities of massacring the people in the South.
