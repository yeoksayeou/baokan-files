Storing the Sweet Potatoes Harvested This Year Well

Our country's farmers, responding to the call of the Party and the state, are striving to expand the planting area of the high-yield crop sweet potato. According to statistics, the country planted about 120 million mu of sweet potatoes this year, and most of them are growing well, with an estimated harvest of 120 to 130 billion jin. Its utility is equivalent to 40 to 50 billion jin of grain, which is a huge wealth for the country and the farmers.

Sweet potatoes have thin skins and high moisture content, making them difficult to store. A little carelessness can cause them to rot in large quantities. Therefore, striving for a good sweet potato harvest is important, and storing the harvested sweet potatoes well is equally important. According to rough statistics, Henan Province rots about 2 to 3 billion jin of sweet potatoes every year. In Hebei Province, the amount of sweet potatoes that rot each year accounts for about 15 percent of the total output. Sichuan, a southern province rich in tuber crops, also often experiences "sweet potato disasters," with large quantities of sweet potatoes rotting. Sweet potatoes are the main staple food for farmers in many areas during the winter and spring seasons. In provinces like Henan and Anhui, there is a saying that "one season of sweet potatoes provides half a year's grain." In these areas, if sweet potatoes cannot be stored well, farmers' lives will face great difficulties. In the winter of 1952, some areas of Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui provinces suffered from severe spring droughts due to the rotting of large quantities of sweet potatoes. In Taoshan Township, Suxian County, Anhui Province, there were two farming households with similar populations, land areas, and grain harvests. One household stored the 5,000 jin of sweet potatoes they harvested well and safely survived the spring drought, even having a surplus of staple food. The other household had several thousand jin of sweet potatoes rot, and by spring, they were short of staple food for two months.

Poor sweet potato storage also has a great impact on agricultural production. In China's concentrated sweet potato production areas, approximately 3 to 4 billion jin of seed potatoes are needed each year to meet production needs. Some areas often experience shortages of seed potatoes in the spring due to excessive rotting of sweet potatoes. This year, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Sichuan, and other provinces have experienced a lack of seed potatoes, preventing the timely and large-scale planting of sweet potatoes. Our government advocates planting more sweet potatoes and other high-yield crops, and farmers also know that planting sweet potatoes is very profitable, but many farmers in many places did not let go and plant more sweet potatoes this year because they were afraid of losses due to poor storage. Therefore, storing sweet potatoes well has become a very important condition for developing sweet potato production.

We must publicize the importance of storing sweet potatoes to farmers and introduce them to methods of storing sweet potatoes. Farmers in various concentrated sweet potato production areas have a wealth of experience in storing sweet potatoes. There are many experienced farmers in various places who have never experienced rotting when storing sweet potatoes. The agricultural production leadership departments and agricultural technology promotion departments in these areas should summarize the experience of the masses on the spot and promote it in a timely manner. Last year, some rural workers in some sweet potato production areas held farmer symposiums to summarize the experience of storing sweet potatoes in a region or a typical farmer, and then organized farmers to learn, which was the correct approach.

Harvesting sweet potatoes in a timely manner is an important condition for preventing rot when storing sweet potatoes. Some farmers hope that sweet potatoes will grow faster in the later stages and deliberately delay the harvest time, which is unscientific. Sweet potatoes grow very quickly in the later stages, and delaying the harvest can indeed increase yields; however, the autumn climate is unpredictable, and if the harvest is too late and a cold wave hits, the sweet potatoes will freeze and be difficult to store well. Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, Henan, and other provinces harvested sweet potatoes very late in 1952, and widespread freezing and rotting occurred. In that year, Henan and Jiangsu provinces alone lost more than a dozen billion jin of sweet potatoes due to this. We must persuade farmers to strive to harvest in a timely manner and not lose big for small gains, resulting in irreparable losses. Appropriately early harvesting of sweet potatoes is also conducive to timely slicing, drying, and storing. Areas planning to promote the slicing and drying method this year should mobilize farmers to harvest early in a timely manner.

There are many reasons for sweet potato rot. Damage from diseases and pests, late harvesting and freezing, rough harvesting, and improper cellar storage can all cause sweet potatoes to rot. In recent years, the rapid spread of sweet potato black rot has become a major threat to the proper storage of sweet potatoes. We should strive to promote the experience of storing fresh sweet potatoes, but under the current conditions, it is difficult to store large quantities of fresh sweet potatoes without rotting. Therefore, we should also advocate the method of slicing, shredding, drying, and storing sweet potatoes. Many farmers are unwilling to adopt this method because they worry that slicing and shredding is laborious and time-consuming, and they are concerned that dried sweet potatoes do not taste as good as fresh sweet potatoes. In some areas of northern Anhui, farmers use "sweet potato slicers" to slice sweet potatoes, and each person can slice up to more than 1,000 jin per day. Last year, the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative promoted a "sweet potato shredding machine," which can shred 5,000 to 6,000 jin per day with two people. Using these more advanced tools can increase work efficiency several times to a dozen times. The agricultural production leadership departments and supply and marketing departments in the main sweet potato producing areas should widely introduce the effectiveness of these tools to farmers and supply them in large quantities. Dried sweet potatoes are also delicious after processing. Farmers in the Jiaodong area of Shandong use dried sweet potatoes mixed with grain to make more than 20 kinds of food. Widely publicizing these methods to farmers can gradually change their habit of not wanting to slice, shred, and dry sweet potatoes. The agricultural research institutions in the sweet potato producing areas should strengthen the experimental work on storing sweet potatoes, summarize and promote reliable and effective storage methods suitable for different regional conditions, and ensure that the stored sweet potatoes do not rot or rot less.

This year, the grain departments will purchase some sweet potatoes in the sweet potato producing areas, which is a new and very meaningful thing. All relevant units should mobilize their staff as soon as possible to study the methods of managing sweet potatoes, learn the basic knowledge of preventing sweet potatoes from freezing and rotting, so as to reduce or avoid possible losses in operation. This summer, collective food units in some cities and towns purchased and stored a lot of potatoes, but due to a lack of storage knowledge, many of them rotted. Collective food units and residents in cities and towns should also learn the knowledge of preventing sweet potatoes from freezing and rotting, and properly store the temporarily stored sweet potatoes.

### 把今年收获的甘薯贮藏好

    把今年收获的甘薯贮藏好
    我国农民响应党和国家的号召，努力扩大高产作物甘薯的种植面积。据统计，今年全国种植的甘薯约一亿二千多万亩，并且大部生长良好，估计可以收获一千二、三百亿斤。它的使用效能等于四、五百亿斤粮食，是国家和农民的一笔巨大的财富。
    甘薯皮薄、水份多，较难保管，稍有不慎，就会大批腐烂。因此，争取甘薯丰收是重要的，把收获的甘薯贮藏好，实有同样重要的意义。据粗略统计，河南省每年腐烂的甘薯约有二、三十亿斤。河北省每年腐烂的甘薯约占总产量的百分之十五。南方盛产薯类的四川，也常发生“苕灾”，腐烂大量甘薯。甘薯是许多地区的农民在冬春两季的主要口粮，河南、安徽等省都有“一季甘薯半年粮”的说法。在这些地区，如果不能把甘薯贮藏好，农民的生活就会发生很大的困难。一九五二年冬，江苏、山东、安徽等省部分地区，由于腐烂了大量甘薯，加重了第二年的春荒。安徽省宿县桃山乡有两户人口、地亩、粮食收获量相差不多的农民，其中一户把收获的五千斤甘薯贮藏好了，平安度过春荒，口粮还有剩余；另一户腐烂了几千斤甘薯，到春季就有两个月的口粮接济不上。
    甘薯贮藏不好，对农业生产的影响也很大。我国各薯类集中产区，每年大约需要三、四十亿斤种薯，才能满足生产的需要。有些地区常常因为甘薯腐烂过多，到春季种薯不够用了。今年河南、河北、山东、四川等省，都发生过缺乏种薯因而不能及时大量种植甘薯的现象。我们的政府提倡多种甘薯和其他高产作物，农民也知道种甘薯收益很大，但今年很多地方的农民没有放手多种甘薯，就是害怕贮藏不好遭受损失。因此，把甘薯贮藏好，已成为发展薯类生产的一个极重要的条件。
    我们要向农民宣传贮藏甘薯的重要意义，同时要向他们介绍贮藏甘薯的方法。各个甘薯集中产区的农民，早有贮藏甘薯的丰富经验。各地都有不少老农，贮藏甘薯从未发生腐烂现象。这些地区的农业生产领导部门和农业技术推广部门，应该就地总结群众的经验，及时加以推广。去年有些甘薯产区的农村工作人员，召开农民座谈会，总结一个地区或一个典型农户贮藏甘薯的经验，然后组织农民学习，这种作法是正确的。
    适时收获甘薯，是贮藏甘薯预防腐烂的重要条件。有些农民希望甘薯在后期加速生长，故意推迟收获时间，这种作法是不科学的。甘薯在后期生长很快，迟收确能增加产量；但深秋气候变化无常，如果收获过迟，遇有寒潮侵袭，甘薯受冻，就难贮藏好。江苏、山东、安徽、河南等省在一九五二年收获甘薯很晚，普遍发生受冻腐烂的现象。这一年，仅河南、江苏两省因此损失的甘薯就有十几亿斤。我们必须说服农民，力争适时收获，不要因小失大，招致无法补救的损失。甘薯适当早收，还有利于及时切片晒干贮藏。今年准备推广切片晒干方法的地区，更应该动员农民适时早收。
    薯块腐烂的原因很多，遭受病虫为害，迟收受冻，收获粗糙，窖藏不当，都能造成甘薯腐烂的现象。近年来甘薯黑斑病迅速蔓延，更是甘薯妥善贮藏的一大威胁。我们应该努力推广贮藏鲜薯的经验，但在目前条件下，贮藏大量鲜薯，又要求不腐烂是有困难的。因此，我们还应该提倡把甘薯切片、刨丝晒干贮藏的方法。许多农民不愿意采用这种方法，他们顾虑切片刨丝费力费时，并且担心薯干不如鲜薯好吃。安徽北部有些地方的农民，使用“甘薯推子”切片，每人每天最多可以切一千多斤；湖南省农业厅和省供销合作总社去年推广一种“红薯刨丝机”，两人每天可刨五、六千斤。运用这些较为进步的工具，可以提高工作效率几倍到十几倍。各主要产薯地区的农业生产领导部门和供销合作部门，应该向农民广泛介绍这些工具的效用，大量供应这些工具。薯干经过加工，也是好吃的。山东胶东一带的农民，用薯干搀混粮食，能做出二十多种食品。广泛地向农民宣传这些方法，就能逐渐改变他们不愿切片刨丝晒干的习惯。各甘薯产区的农业研究机关，应该加强贮藏甘薯的试验工作，总结和推广适合不同地区情况的可靠有效的贮藏方法，保证贮藏的甘薯不腐烂或少腐烂。
    今年粮食部门将在甘薯产区收购部分甘薯，这是一件新的很有意义的事情。各有关单位应该及早发动所属工作人员，研究经营甘薯的方法，学习防止甘薯受冻、腐烂的基本常识，以减少或避免经营中可能发生的损失。今年夏季，有些市镇的集体伙食单位购存很多马铃薯，由于不会保管，腐烂很多。市镇的集体伙食单位和居民也应该学会防止甘薯受冻、腐烂的常识，把临时储存的甘薯保管好。
