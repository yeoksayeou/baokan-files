At the invitation of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, the Japanese Diet Members Delegation, which came to participate in China's National Day celebrations, has concluded its visit to China and set off to return home on October 18. Prior to this, Chairman Mao Zedong of China met with the Japanese Diet Members Delegation on October 15, and both sides exchanged views on various issues between China and Japan in a friendly and harmonious atmosphere. As a result of the exchange of views, both sides reached a consensus on seven issues, including realizing the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, promoting trade and cultural exchanges, taking care of each other's overseas Chinese, and handling Japanese war criminals in China. On October 17, Peng Zhen, Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, and Eikichi Kamabayashi, head of the Japanese Diet Members Delegation, issued a joint communiqué, confirming the consensus on the above seven issues and expressing their willingness to make the greatest efforts for this.
    This development in Sino-Japanese relations is the result of the joint efforts of the people of the two countries over the past few years. It is of great significance for promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations and strengthening the friendship between the people of our two countries. It should be said that the publication of the joint communiqué is also an important contribution to consolidating peace in the Far East. The Chinese people warmly welcome this development in the relations between the two countries.
    It is only natural that the people of China and Japan demand the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. China and Japan are close neighbors, and the two countries have a long history of peaceful coexistence. Cultural and economic exchanges between the two countries, as well as friendly exchanges between the people, can be traced back to more than a thousand years ago. This friendly relationship was hindered for several years due to the rise of Japanese militarism. With the end of World War II and the changes in the international situation over the past decade, the Chinese people's feelings towards Japan have undergone great changes.
    In the past ten years after the war, China has changed from a semi-colonial country to an independent and sovereign country, and Japan has been forced into a semi-occupied state. Based on their own experience, the Chinese people fully understand the painful feelings of the Japanese people. At the same time, China's independence and sovereignty have not yet been fully guaranteed, and China and Japan are now both subject to US aggression. The United States is forcibly occupying China's territory of Taiwan, and at the same time, it is still maintaining its occupation of Japan. It is precisely because of this foreign military occupation and aggression that the people of China and Japan are threatened by the forces of war. The situations of the people of the two countries are similar in these respects. The same experiences cannot but arouse common concern; efforts made to meet the same demands cannot but benefit each other. The Chinese people are concerned about the efforts made by the Japanese people and Japan's broad patriotic forces to get rid of foreign occupation and strive for national independence, and they have heartfelt sympathy and support for these efforts. This effort is not only for the benefit of Japan, but also for the benefit of the entire Far East.
    We understand that in order to get rid of the state of occupation and strive for independence, peace, and democracy, the Japanese people and patriotic forces from all aspects and strata in Japan are facing difficulties. Those in the Japanese ruling group who tie Japan's fate to the wheels of the United States are determined to take a path that endangers Japan's interests. They not only make Japan politically, economically, and militarily subservient to the United States, but also agree to send the sons and daughters of the Japanese people abroad to serve as cannon fodder for the United States, and encourage the United States to turn Japan into its atomic war base. However, in the face of difficulties, the Japanese people and all Japanese patriots have strength. Over the years, in the struggle against US military bases, against atomic and hydrogen bombs, against US control of Japan's economy and trade, and for the normalization of diplomatic relations and trade between Japan and the Soviet Union and Japan and China, the Japanese people and Japanese patriotic forces have strengthened their strength in many ways and won more and more sympathy and support from the people of Asia and the international community. In particular, the signatures of more than 30 million Japanese people against the use of atomic weapons is an important symbol of the development of the strength of the Japanese people, and has been praised by peace-loving people all over the world. The development of this just patriotic force cannot be stopped by any force.
    The Japanese people are a hardworking and brave people, a people with a high degree of national self-esteem. For more than a thousand years, Japan has existed as a great independent country. We believe that the Japanese people will be able to get rid of their current situation, regain their country's independent status, and open up a bright future of peace and democracy for themselves.
    China and Japan are both important countries in Asia. Restoring normal relations and strengthening friendly cooperation between the two countries will not only benefit the economic and cultural development of the two countries, but also have a profound impact on peace in Asia. If normal relations between China and Japan are not restored, the US aggressive forces will be able to provoke and incite between the two countries, create excuses for themselves to continue occupying Japan, and create unrest in the Far East.
    The Chinese government has always followed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence to guide its international diplomatic relations. We are even more willing to promote the normalization of relations between the two countries with our close neighbor Japan based on the Five Principles. Chairman Liu Shaoqi said in his speech at the farewell banquet for the Japanese Diet Members Delegation: "We are willing to establish normal relations with our neighbor Japan as soon as possible, and we are willing to implement the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence on this basis, in order to consolidate and develop our friendly relations with each other. This will guarantee peace in the Far East and consolidate world peace." This represents the unanimous position of the Chinese people. We believe this is also what the people of Asia and the world hope for.
    In order to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, the Chinese government has made many efforts, but this effort has not yet been responded to by the Japanese government. This cannot but be regretted. This practice of the Japanese government is not in the interests of the Japanese people, nor is it the view of far-sighted politicians in Japan. Eikichi Kamabayashi, head of the Japanese Diet Members Delegation, and Yoshihiko Kitajima, head of the Japanese Delegation of Six Major Cities, expressed their determination to work for the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Fuzanosuke Kuhara, chairman of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations, who recently visited China, also said when passing through Hong Kong on his way back to Japan, "The people of the two countries absolutely need normalized relations, and we hope to normalize relations because we must get along with our neighbors in a friendly manner."
    After the Geneva Four-Power Conference, the international atmosphere has eased. On the issue of the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, the decisive key lies in the attitude of the Japanese government. As long as the Japanese government takes positive steps on the issue of the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, it will further promote the improvement of the international atmosphere and make the relationship between China and Japan develop in a direction conducive to peace.
    Over the past few years, thanks to the efforts of the people of China and Japan and the active assistance of the Chinese government, there has been some development in trade and cultural exchanges between the two countries. Now, although Sino-Japanese relations are still abnormal, this situation should not and cannot be allowed to hinder various exchanges between the people of the two countries. The joint communiqué stated that efforts must be made to abolish the regulations of the Paris Coordinating Committee as soon as possible, which is absolutely necessary. If this can be done, Sino-Japanese trade will usher in an unprecedented upsurge. Under the current circumstances, we should have more people of all kinds interacting with each other, we should have more trade between us, and there should be more mutual literary and artistic activities, and mutual observation. This is to make the normalization of relations between the two countries realized sooner, and also to strengthen the understanding between the people of the two countries, improve their material lives, and enrich their cultural lives.
    This Japanese Diet Members Delegation included members of all major political parties in Japan. During their short visit, they saw the sincere efforts of the Chinese people to seek peace and improve relations between the two countries. As we bid farewell to them on their return home, we hope that for the benefit of the people of the two countries and for peace, they will, with the support of the Japanese people, vigorously promote the Japanese government, thereby making a new start for the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. On the Chinese side, we will also continue to work with our consistent sincerity to ensure that the various consensus opinions of both parties in the joint communiqué are realized at an early date.

### 努力促进中日关系正常化

    努力促进中日关系正常化
    应我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的邀请，前来参加我国国庆典礼的日本国会议员访华团，已经结束了在中国的访问，在十月十八日启程回国。在此以前，我国毛泽东主席在十月十五日曾经接见了日本国会议员访华团，双方在友好、融洽的空气中就中日之间的各项问题交换了意见。交换意见的结果，双方在实现中日邦交正常化、促进贸易和文化交流、照顾双方侨民、处理在中国的日本战犯等七项问题上取得了一致的意见。十月十七日，我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会秘书长彭真和日本国会议员访华团团长上林山荣吉发表联合公报，确认了上述七项问题上的一致意见，并表示愿意为此尽最大的努力。
    中日两国关系上的这个发展是两国人民几年来共同努力的结果。它对于促进中日关系的正常化、加强我们两国人民的友谊，有重大的意义。应该说，联合公报的发表，对于巩固远东和平也是有重要贡献的。中国人民热忱欢迎两国关系的这种发展。
    中日两国人民要求中日关系正常化，是很自然的事情。中国和日本是近邻，两国在历史上有着长期的和平相处的关系。两国之间的文化交流和经济交流以及人民之间的友好往来，可以远溯到一千多年以前。这种友好的关系在若干年中由于日本军国主义的兴起而受到了阻碍。随着第二次世界大战的结束和战后十年以来国际局势的改变，中国人民对日本的感情已经有了很大的变化。
    在战后十年之中，中国由一个半殖民地的国家变成一个独立自主的国家，日本被迫处于半被占领的状态。中国人民根据自己的经验，完全了解日本人民的痛苦心情。同时，中国的独立主权也还没得到完全的保障，中国和日本一样现在都受到美国的侵略。美国强占着中国领土台湾，同时它也还保持着它对日本的占领状态。正是由于这种外来的军事占领和侵略活动，中日两国人民都受到了战争势力的威胁。两国人民的处境在这些方面就有着相同的地方。同样的遭遇不能不引起共同的关切；为了满足同样的要求而进行的努力，不能不对于彼此都有好处。中国人民关心日本人民和日本广泛的爱国力量为摆脱外国占领状态和争取国家独立所作的努力，并且对这种努力抱有衷心的同情和支持。这种努力不但是为了日本的利益，而且对整个远东都是有好处的。
    我们了解，为了摆脱占领状态，争取独立、和平和民主，日本人民和日本各方面各阶层的爱国力量面对着困难。日本统治集团中那些把日本的命运系在美国的车轮上的人物，一心要走一条危害日本利益的道路。他们不但使日本在政治、经济、军事上屈从美国，而且答应派遣日本人民的子弟到国外去为美国充当炮灰，鼓励美国把日本变成它的原子战争基地。但是，在困难面前，日本人民和日本一切爱国者是有力量的。几年以来，在反对美国军事基地、反对原子弹和氢弹、反对美国控制日本经济和贸易，争取日苏、日中邦交和贸易正常化等等斗争中，日本人民和日本爱国力量从多方面越来越壮大了自己的力量，越来越赢得了亚洲人民和国际上广泛的同情和支持。特别是三千万以上的日本人民签名反对使用原子武器，这是日本人民力量发展的重要标志，受到了世界爱好和平人民的同声赞扬。这种正义的爱国力量的发展是任何势力都阻挡不住的。
    日本人民是勤劳勇敢的人民，是具有高度民族自尊心的人民。一千多年以来，日本一直是作为一个伟大的独立国家而存在的。我们相信，日本人民一定能够摆脱他们目前的处境，重新取得自己国家的独立地位，为自己开辟和平、民主的远大前途。
    中日两国都是亚洲的重要国家。恢复两国之间的正常关系和加强友好合作，不但有利于两国的经济和文化的发展，而且对于亚洲的和平也将产生深远的影响。中日两国之间的正常关系不恢复，就使美国侵略势力有可能在两国之间进行挑拨和煽动，为自己继续占领日本制造借口，并在远东制造不安。
    中国政府一向按着和平共处的五项原则来指导它的国际外交关系。我们对于自己的紧邻日本，更是愿意根据五项原则来促进两国关系正常化。刘少奇委员长在欢送日本国会议员访华团的讲话中说：“我们愿意同我们的邻国日本早日建立正常关系，我们愿意在这样的基础上，实行互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处的五项原则，以巩固和发展我们相互间的友好关系。这将使远东和平获得保证，使世界和平也获得巩固。”这代表中国人民的一致主张。我们相信这也是亚洲和世界人民所希望的。
    为了促进中日关系的正常化，中国政府作了多方面的努力，但是这种努力一直还没有得到日本政府的响应。这不能不令人感到遗憾。日本政府这种做法不合乎日本人民的利益，也不是日本的远见的政治家们的看法。日本国会议员访华团团长上林山荣吉和日本六大城市访华团团长北岛义彦就表示要为中日邦交正常化努力。最近访问了中国的日本恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议会长久原房之助在回国途中经过香港时也说，“两国人民绝对需要有正常化的关系，我们希望关系正常化，因为我们必须同邻邦友好相处。”
    在日内瓦四大国会议以后，国际气氛已经有了缓和。在中日关系正常化的问题上，决定性的关键在于日本政府的态度。只要日本政府在中日关系正常化的问题上采取积极的步骤，就能进一步促进国际气氛的改善，并使中日之间的关系在有利于和平的方向上得到进展。
   几年以来，由于中日两国人民的努力，由于中国政府的积极协助，两国人民在贸易往来和文化交流方面已经有了一些发展。现在，尽管中日关系还是不正常，但是，这种情况却不应该也不能被容许来阻挠两国人民之间的各种往来关系。联合公报表示必须以迅速废除巴黎统筹委员会的规定为目标而努力，这是完全必要的。能够作到这样，中日贸易就会出现前所未有的高潮。在目前情况下，我们应该有更多的各种各样的人相互往来，我们之间应该进行更多的贸易，应该有更多的相互之间的文学艺术活动，彼此相互观摩。这是为了使两国关系正常化快些实现，也是为了加强两国人民的了解，改进他们的物质生活，和丰富他们的文化生活。
    这次日本国会议员访华团包括了日本各重要政党的议员。在他们短短的访问期间，看到了中国人民要求和平、要求改善两国关系的真诚努力。在欢送他们回国的时候，我们希望为了两国人民的利益，为了和平，他们将在日本人民的支持下有力地推动日本政府，从而为中日关系正常化作出一个新的起点。在中国人民方面，我们也将本着一贯的诚意，为使联合公报上双方一致的各项意见早日实现而继续努力。
