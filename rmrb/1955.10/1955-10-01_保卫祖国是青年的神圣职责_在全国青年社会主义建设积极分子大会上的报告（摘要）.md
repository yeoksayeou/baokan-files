    Defending the Motherland is the Sacred Duty of Youth
    --Report at the National Congress of Active Builders of Socialism (Abstract)
    Tan Zheng, Deputy Minister of National Defense
    I am very pleased to have the opportunity to meet with you comrades today, and I would like to take this opportunity to talk about strengthening our national defense. This is a matter of particular concern to young comrades, and it is also a very important issue in building socialism.
    As everyone knows, our socialist construction is not proceeding peacefully, but must be achieved through serious struggle. As Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy: "The realization of the Five-Year Plan is a special form of class struggle in the current environment. The complete realization of the Five-Year Plan will bring about tremendous development of our country's industry and the entire national economy, and will greatly increase the proportion of socialist economic components and greatly reduce the proportion of non-socialist economic components. That is to say, the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance will be further consolidated. All of this will be rejoiced by the people of the whole country and our friends all over the world. However, the victory of the people is the failure of the people's enemies, that is, the failure of the counter-revolutionary restoration attempts of imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, and all elements hostile to the people. The enemies of the people are determined not to fail themselves, and they will inevitably try every means to sabotage our Five-Year Plan." This is absolutely correct. We must heighten our vigilance, resolutely eliminate the counter-revolutionary elements hidden within us, and defeat any form of sabotage of the Five-Year Plan by enemies and reactionaries. Similarly, we must also be vigilant and guard against foreign enemies attacking our country and launching surprise attacks. At present, American imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan, stationing troops in the Taiwan Strait, actively assisting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group in equipping and training, and establishing military bases and organizing military groups to encircle our country in other areas around our country, using atomic warfare to intimidate our country and the people of all countries in the world. In this situation, if we lose our vigilance and do not take the necessary precautions, it would be very dangerous. If we encounter a surprise attack by the enemy, we will be caught off guard.
    So how do we strengthen our national defense? What is the responsibility of youth in national defense construction?
    Strengthening national defense is an arduous task involving many aspects. Here, I will only talk about two things: developing industry and implementing the compulsory military service system.
    Chairman Mao said: "Without industry, there is no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." Realizing national industrialization can greatly enhance the country's economic strength and lay the foundation for the modernization of national defense. Modern warfare is different from past wars. In addition to infantry, there are other military branches fighting. The equipment of the army is not only light weapons such as rifles and machine guns, but also various aircraft, ships, tanks, and artillery, as well as various equipment for commanding these things and various military supplies. Corresponding to modern equipment, there must also be modern transportation conditions and transportation tools, such as ships, railways, and highways. Of course, these equipment and facilities can be gradually resolved after the completion of the First Five-Year Plan and in the development of future construction. This is a gratifying thing. In the past, because we had no industry, our army's equipment was always inferior to that of the enemy, and even this inferior equipment could not be fully supplied, which added many difficulties in combat and made it impossible to technically and firepower-wise overwhelm the enemy. In order to end this situation, in order to create conditions to improve and strengthen the equipment of our army, the Five-Year Plan places the focus on vigorously developing industry, especially heavy industry, which is very important. It not only conforms to the long-term interests of the Chinese people, but also conforms to the interests of our national defense. This requires the efforts of the people of the whole country, especially the comrades on the industrial front, and industry must rely on the support of agriculture, transportation, cultural and educational science. Therefore, your hard work in various posts of national construction is of great significance to strengthening our national defense forces and has a great supporting role for the People's Liberation Army.
    Comrades also know that the decisive factor in the fate of war is people. Therefore, to strengthen national defense, the most important thing is people, and organized and trained people. In addition to having a strong standing army, we must also have a solid reserve of soldiers. The implementation of China's Military Service Law and the promotion of the compulsory military service system provide a reliable guarantee for our country to establish a strong reserve force. Therefore, to strengthen national defense, it is necessary to implement the compulsory military service system. The compulsory military service system has many benefits. In addition to reducing the number of standing troops in peacetime to save military expenditure, increase construction investment, and enable young people across the country to fairly and reasonably perform the glorious obligation of military service, the most important thing is that it can accumulate a strong reserve force for the country. Because with the system of regular conscription and regular retirement, every year a group of soldiers who have completed their active service and have been trained by the army retire and transfer to the first category of reserve service; citizens who meet the conditions for active service but have not been conscripted into active service are incorporated into the second category of reserve service. According to the provisions of the Military Service Law, these two types of reserve service must undergo certain military training in peacetime. In this way, after a few years, our country can accumulate a large number of trained reserve soldiers. Once imperialism launches a war, under the call of the motherland, new divisions and regiments can be quickly organized and sent to the front to assist the first-line troops in combat and defeat the enemy. During the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Union was able to defeat the German, Japanese, and Italian fascist armies relatively quickly, one of the factors being that the Soviet Union had trained a large number of reserve soldiers in advance. Our country is a large country with a population of 600 million, and there are many young and middle-aged people. As long as we organize these young and middle-aged people in accordance with the provisions of the Military Service Law and give them certain training, our country's source of troops will be inexhaustible.
    The compulsory military service system is an advanced and reasonable military service system, and the people of the whole country, especially the youth of the whole country, warmly support this system. When the conscription and replenishment of soldiers were carried out on a trial basis in November last year in accordance with the principle of compulsory military service, more than 830,000 people were actually conscripted, and more than 10,032,000 people signed up, exceeding the actual conscription number by more than eleven times. The speech of Mr. Cai Renwen from Qizhong Township, Bo'ai County, Henan, at the mass meeting represented the wishes of the broad masses of the people. He said: "Looking back at the years when the Kuomintang reactionaries and the Japanese devils ruled, I had no house or land, and no one ever considered me a human being. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, I turned over, got a house and land, and this year I also sold more than 800 kilograms of surplus grain. Now, American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek have signed a treaty of aggression and want to come and kill and set fires again, which is not acceptable. I will do a good job in production, strive to sell 1,000 kilograms of surplus grain to the state in the summer, and also send my son to serve in the army. In order to protect the good times, I want to have grain when needed, and people when needed." In order to enlist in the army, many young people, when examining their bodies, were afraid that they were not tall enough and wore thick-soled shoes; some were afraid that they were not heavy enough and put a few stones in their pockets. The masses reflected: "In the past, the Kuomintang army was drafting and grabbing soldiers, but now the People's Liberation Army is examining and selecting soldiers." Yang Xianqing from Youji Village, Shiqu District, Liaoyang County, Liaoning Province, signed up for military service. When the masses evaluated him, they said that he was not qualified because he was missing three teeth. His mother then said: "It doesn't matter if he has lost three teeth, we will immediately have them filled." The next day, she went to the city and had the teeth filled. Jia Sheng's mother from Shuangjia Village, Sanqu District, Qinglong County, Rehe, made a plan for her three sons to join the army: the eldest son is 21 years old, the second son is 18 years old, and the third son is 16 years old. This year, let the eldest go, next year let the second go, and three years later, when the eldest son returns, let the third son go again. There are endless vivid stories of people warmly supporting the Military Service Law. From the above examples alone, it fully shows that the broad masses of the people across the country have expressed their warm support for the Military Service Law and their active support for the compulsory military service system with practical actions.
    However, it should be estimated that because the compulsory military service system has just begun to be implemented, the masses do not fully understand its great significance and benefits; because the Kuomintang reactionaries' long-term evil influence of drafting and grabbing soldiers has not been completely eliminated among the masses; coupled with the rumors and sabotage of hidden counter-revolutionary elements, there will inevitably be concerns in the minds of some people. This requires us to work. Here, young comrades have a particularly important responsibility. Young comrades should often publicize the principles and benefits of implementing the compulsory military service system to the people, to the youth, and to their parents and brothers, and at appropriate times launch a propaganda campaign on the Military Service Law to raise the people's national defense awareness and patriotic consciousness. When the state conscripts soldiers every year, young people should actively enlist in the army and use practical actions to support the Military Service Law and to express their love for the motherland. Young activists should become models for enlisting and actively lead the youth to respond to the call of the state. Recently, the State Council announced this year's conscription order. We believe that the youth of the motherland will respond to the call of the motherland with even greater enthusiasm. However, due to China's large population, the young people conscripted into the army by the state each year only account for a small portion of the eligible young people. Other young people who have not been conscripted into the army should work with peace of mind, actively do their own work, and make more contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland; At the same time, in accordance with the order of the Ministry of National Defense, participate in reserve military training in factories, rural areas, organs, and schools, learn military knowledge, and prepare to defend the motherland.
    Among those present are representatives of young people in the army, and many young people also hope to serve in the army and become a glorious People's Liberation Army. So, how to be a glorious People's Liberation Army fighter who is loyal to the motherland? Where exactly does the strong and invincible strength of the People's Liberation Army lie? I would like to talk to comrades about this issue.
    You know, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is an invincible and unconquerable heroic army. Why is this army invincible? What is the source of its strength? All reactionaries at home and abroad cannot see this source clearly. They often underestimate the strength of the people's army with short-sighted eyes, which makes them suffer greatly. The People's Liberation Army has grown and developed under the personal leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. It has the strong leadership of the Party, it is loyal to the people, and it is closely integrated with the people. This is where the strong strength of the People's Liberation Army lies. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago: "The reason why this army has strength is because all those who participate in this army have conscious discipline; they are not combined and fighting for the private interests of a few people or narrow groups, but for the interests of the broad masses of the people, for the interests of the entire nation. Standing closely with the Chinese people and serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army." This army is fundamentally different from any reactionary army in Chinese history. The old army served the bureaucrats, landlords, and capitalists, and was a tool for oppressing the working people. The relationship between its officers and soldiers and between the army and the people was antagonistic and extremely bad. Because it was hated by the people and could not get the support of the people, it often suffered defeats. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a completely new type of people's army. It has a clear political direction instructed by the Party and Chairman Mao. It is forever loyal to the cause of the people, knows for whom to fight and why to fight. It has a flesh-and-blood connection with the people and is supported and supported by the people everywhere. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army has a spirit of advancing without fear, high morale, and invincible strength.
    Loyalty to the motherland and loyalty to the people are the basic factors that constitute the combat power of our army. Therefore, cultivating a high degree of political consciousness has become the most basic issue in our army building, and it is also the primary requirement for each of our young soldiers. We must cultivate young soldiers' high degree of hatred for the enemy and their infinite loyalty and love for the motherland, the people, and the cause of socialism. Have a high degree of communist morality and a courageous and fearless spirit to overcome difficulties. Young comrades must often educate and encourage themselves with the glorious images of revolutionary martyrs, learn from the noble revolutionary integrity of young leaders such as Fang Zhimin, Yun Daiying, and Qu Qiubai, and learn from the heroic and tenacious spirit of people's heroes such as Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, and Liu Hulan, who sacrificed themselves for the country. Many young comrades want to become heroes and make contributions to the motherland and make more and greater contributions to the motherland and the people. This kind of volunteerism is very good and worthy of encouragement, but it should not be assumed that heroic behavior is to find an occasional opportunity to "become famous all over the world." Only those who advance regardless of all kinds of difficulties for the benefit of the people, only those who have a high degree of political consciousness and resolutely fight for the realization of the people's lofty ideals can achieve the people's heroic cause and can make contributions to the motherland and the people. Therefore, young comrades should study politics well, care about major events at home and abroad, care about the cause of the people, and constantly improve their socialist consciousness, not be affected by the reactionary ideas of the bourgeoisie and the contamination of bad habits of the old society. Read more stories of heroic figures who have worked hard and fought bravely for the cause of the motherland and the people, as well as beneficial books that can enlighten young people's wisdom, and do not read those yellow, obscene, and absurd books and newspapers that erode young people's ambitions. Young people must be determined to dedicate their entire body and mind to the people's cause in their combat posts. Only if the young generation of our country are heroic and fearless, not afraid of hardship, and have a spirit of self-sacrifice and noble moral qualities, then our army members will have higher political quality and tenacious fighting spirit. Only an army composed of such members is an invincible army, and our People's Liberation Army is the model of this kind of army.
    Modern armies require every soldier to have a high degree of organization and discipline. When various military branches cooperate in combat, every movement of the soldiers must be accurate, rapid, obey the command, and execute orders. Because modern armies are equipped with machinery, their organizational system must also be as strict as precise machines, and all members must act in strict accordance with the regulations. Only in this way can the entire army operate freely and harmoniously like a machine, and conduct training and combat. Otherwise, due to one person's fault, it will often affect the victory of the battle. In addition to strengthening training after joining the army, this excellent quality also needs to be established with a certain foundation before joining the army. Now China is carrying out socialist construction, and young people have the opportunity to exercise their organization and discipline in factories, mines, rural areas, organs, schools, and other various mass organizations. As long as you always pay attention to this point, you will definitely be able to improve yourself in this regard.
    Fighters in modern armies must have strong physique. If they do not strengthen physical exercise in peacetime, they will encounter difficulties in intense and fierce battles. The success or failure of a battle often depends on who can endure and overcome difficulties and persevere to the last time. Therefore, a strong physique is very important for the army. Many young people hope to be in the air force and navy. This kind of volunteerism is of course very good, but pilots must have a strong and healthy body, and sailors also need a strong body. Without the condition of physique, volunteering alone will not work, and a strong physique can only be cultivated in peacetime exercise. Some young people have high patriotic enthusiasm, but they do not pay attention to physical exercise, and their physical conditions are not enough, so they cannot realize their volunteer to join the army to defend the motherland. In the past, due to the oppression and devastation of the reactionaries, the people's lives were very painful, and the young people's bodies were generally not strong enough. People called us "sick men of East Asia." Because material conditions have improved and they are extremely happy in spirit, the situation of young people in New China has changed, but exercise is still necessary. Young people must respond to Chairman Mao's call for "three goods," actively participate in sports activities, participate in labor defense and national defense exercises, and become strong and healthy young people.
    Young people should also pay attention to learning cultural sciences and military knowledge in peacetime to lay the foundation for mastering modern military technology. The construction of a modern army requires every officer to be proficient in the military knowledge of his department, and every soldier to be proficient in the weapons in his hands, and these technologies are quite complex. If there is no certain level of cultural science, if you cannot read, write, or calculate, then it will be much more difficult to learn. Without the knowledge of mathematics and physics, it is difficult to be an artillery observer, or a pilot, sailor, or engineer. The cultural and scientific knowledge required to be a commander is even higher. Young people should seize the opportunity, use the possible conditions at work, and use the indomitable spirit to learn culture. At the same time, they should also learn military knowledge, cultivate interest in military science, and master preliminary military technology. In this regard, the army has the responsibility to help local youth organize learning. Everyone should adopt different methods for learning according to the environment and conditions. In factories, organs, schools, and other places, defense sports activities should be carried out more widely, such as mechanical exercises, track and field, shooting, grenade throwing, military camping, mountain climbing, air defense, marching, weapon explanations, fire rescue, swimming, boating, etc. In areas where conditions permit, gliding, parachuting, navigation, and driving motorcycles can also be developed as a priority. In schools above the senior high school level, military training should also be used to systematically learn military knowledge and technology. In rural areas, military knowledge can be learned through the training of militiamen and reservists.
    In short, strengthening our country's national defense construction and defending the socialist cause of the motherland requires the people of the whole country, especially young comrades, to work hard in various work posts.
    Finally, I would like to say a few words to the young people in the army. Today, 155 young activists from the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are participating in the conference. You represent all the young people in the people's army and are here to attend this conference. You should report your work well to the young people who attend the meeting, listen to their experiences, and learn from them with humility. Because the people of the whole country love their army, they give the young people in the army a lofty honor. This is the encouragement and hope of the people for the young people in the army. You must not be proud and always be with the young people and the people of the whole country, defend our great motherland, protect the people's peaceful labor, abide by your posts, always maintain combat readiness, and contribute everything to the liberation of Taiwan and the defense of the motherland.
    Comrades! Building socialism is a glorious and great cause. The work we are currently doing and the achievements we have made are only very preliminary. There are still many things we have to do. Young activists must recognize the importance of their responsibilities and the glory of their posts, and never be proud and complacent. We must listen to the leadership of the Party, closely unite the masses, study hard, work honestly and diligently, and show our talents in building and defending the socialist cause of the motherland. Young people should not only become active builders of socialism, but also become glorious defenders of our great motherland. (Xinhua News Agency)

    保卫祖国是青年的神圣职责
    ——在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上的报告（摘要）
    国防部副部长　谭政
    我很高兴今天有机会和同志们见面，想借此机会，讲讲关于加强我国国防的问题。这是青年同志们特别关心的，也是建设社会主义非常重要的问题。
    大家知道，我们的社会主义建设不是和和平平地进行的，而是要通过严重的斗争才能实现。正如李富春副总理在关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告中所说：“实现五年计划，是在现在环境下的一种特殊形式的阶级斗争。五年计划的完全实现，将使我国的工业和全部国民经济有巨大的发展，将使社会主义经济成份的比重大大增加，非社会主义经济成份的比重很大缩小。这也就是说，以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政将更加巩固。所有这些，全国人民和我们在全世界的朋友都将为之欢欣鼓舞。可是人民的胜利就是人民的敌人的失败，就是帝国主义、蒋介石卖国集团、一切敌视人民的分子的反革命复辟企图的失败。人民的敌人是决不愿意自己失败的，他们必然千方百计地来破坏我们的五年计划。”这是完全对的。我们必须提高警惕，坚决肃清隐藏在我们内部的反革命分子，击破敌人和反动分子对于五年计划的任何形式的破坏。同样我们也必须提高警惕，提防国外敌人对于我国的进攻与突然袭击；现在美帝国主义仍然霸占着我国领土台湾，陈兵台湾海峡，积极帮助蒋介石卖国集团进行装备与训练，并在我国周围的其他地区建立军事基地和组织军事集团包围我国，用原子战争对我国和世界各国人民进行恫吓。在这种情形下，如果我们失去警惕，不作应有的戒备，那是非常危险的，遇到敌人突然袭击时，我们就会措手不及。
    那末我们怎样来加强我国国防呢？青年在国防建设中的责任是什么？
    加强国防，这是包括多方面的一项繁重的任务，这里只就关于发展工业与实行义务兵役制两件事来说。
    毛主席说过：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”实现国家工业化，可以大大增强国家的经济力量，并为国防现代化打下基础。现代战争与过去战争不同，除了步兵之外，还有其他兵种作战，在军队的装备上也不只是步枪机关枪这类的轻武器，同时还包括各种飞机、舰艇、坦克和大炮，以及指挥这些东西的各种设备和各种军需器材。与现代化装备相适应的，还要有现代化的交通条件和交通工具，如轮船、铁路、公路等。当然这些装备与设备，在第一个五年计划完成以后，在今后建设的发展中，是可以逐步解决的。这是一件值得欣喜的事。过去我们因为没有工业，我军的装备较之敌人总是低劣的，而且连这种低劣的装备也不能得到充分的供应，以致在作战中增加许多困难，不能在技术上火力上压倒敌人。为了结束这种状况，为了创造条件来改善和加强我军的装备，五年计划把重点摆在大力发展工业特别是重工业，这是十分重要的，它不但符合我国人民的长远利益，而且也是符合我国国防利益的。这需要全国人民特别是工业战线上的同志们的努力，而工业又要依靠农业、运输业、文教科学事业的支持。所以说，你们在祖国建设各个岗位上努力工作，对于加强我国国防力量，都有极大的意义，对于人民解放军，都有极大的支援作用。
    同志们又知道，决定战争命运的因素是人，所以，加强国防力量，最重要的还是人，而且是有组织经过训练的人。我们除了要有一支强大的常备军外，还必须有雄厚的后备兵员。我国兵役法的实施，义务兵役制的推行，就为我国建立强大的后备兵员，提供了可靠的保证。因此，要加强国防力量，必须实行义务兵役制，实行义务兵役制的好处很多，除了在平时可以缩减常备军的员额以节省军费的开支，增加建设投资，以及使全国青年都能公平合理地担任服兵役的光荣义务外，最主要的，它可以为国家积蓄起强大的预备兵员。因为有了定期征集和定期退伍的制度，每年都有一批服现役期满的、经过军队训练的士兵退伍，转入第一类预备役；具备服现役条件、而未被征集服现役的公民则编入第二类预备役。按兵役法的规定，这两类预备役在平时都要实行一定的军事训练。这样，几年以后，我国就可以积蓄起大量的经过训练了的预备兵员。一旦帝国主义发动战争，在祖国一声号令之下，就可以很快地组织新的师团，开上前线，协助第一线部队作战，把敌人打败。苏联在伟大卫国战争期间，能够较快地打败德、日、意法西斯军队，其中的一个因素，就是由于苏联事先训练好了大量的预备兵员。我国是具有六亿人口的大国，青壮年是很多的，只要我们按照兵役法的规定把这些青壮年组织起来，给以一定的训练，我国的兵源就是取之不尽，用之不竭的。
    义务兵役制是一种先进的合理的兵役制度，全国人民尤其是全国青年，都热烈拥护这个制度。去年十一月按照义务兵役制原则试行征集补充兵员时，实征八十三万多人，报名的就有一千零三万二千多人，超过实征人数的十一倍。河南博爱县七中乡蔡人温老先生在群众大会上的讲话代表了广大人民的心愿，他说：“回想过去在国民党反动派和日本鬼子统治的年月，房无一间，地无一垅，从来没有人把我算做人。解放后，在共产党的领导下，翻了身，分了房、分了地，今年我还卖了八百斤余粮。现在美帝国主义和蒋贼又订了侵略战争条约，想来再杀人放火，这可不行。我要搞好生产，争取在夏季卖给国家一千斤余粮，还要送我的儿子服兵役。为了保卫好时光，我要做到要粮有粮，要人有人。”许多青年为了应征入伍，在检查身体时，有的怕不够高，穿上厚底鞋；有的怕不够重，怀里揣几块石头。群众反映说：“过去国民党军队是抽丁抓兵，现在解放军是考兵选兵。”辽宁省辽阳县十区游击村杨显清报名服兵役，群众在评比时说他缺三个牙不能合格，他母亲接着就说：“掉了三个牙不要紧，我们马上镶上。”第二天就到城里把牙镶好了。热河青龙县三区双家村贾生的母亲为三个儿子做了一个参军计划：大儿子二十一岁，二儿子十八岁，三儿子十六岁。今年叫大的去，明年叫二的去，三年后大儿子回来，又叫三儿子去。人民热烈拥护兵役法的生动故事是说不完的，仅从以上几个事例，就充分说明了全国广大人民已经以实际行动表示了他们对于兵役法的热烈拥护，对于义务兵役制的积极支持。
    但是应当估计到，由于义务兵役制还是刚开始实行，它的重大意义和好处，群众还不完全了解；由于国民党反动派长期抽丁抓兵的恶劣影响在群众中还没有完全消除；加上暗藏的反革命分子的造谣破坏，在某些群众思想上不会没有顾虑的。这就需要我们进行工作，这里，青年同志们有着特别重大的责任。青年同志们应当把实行义务兵役制的道理和好处经常向人民群众作宣传，向青年们宣传，向自己的父母兄弟宣传，并在适当时机开展一个兵役法的宣传运动，以提高人民的国防观念和爱国主义觉悟。在国家每年征集兵员的时候，青年们要踊跃应征，用实际行动来拥护兵役法，来表达自己对于祖国的热爱。青年积极分子应成为应征的模范，积极带领青年群众去响应国家的号召。最近，国务院公布了今年度的征兵命令，我们相信，祖国的青年一定会以更高的热情来响应祖国的号召。但是由于我国人口众多，国家每年征集入伍的青年只占适龄青年的一小部分，其他未应征入伍的青年，应该安心工作，积极作好自己的工作，为祖国社会主义建设多多作出贡献；同时依照国防部的命令在工厂、农村、机关、学校中参加预备役军事训练，学习军事知识，准备好保卫祖国的本领。
    在座的有军队青年的代表，许多青年也都希望服兵役当一个光荣的人民解放军。那末，怎样当一个光荣的忠于祖国的人民解放军战士呢？人民解放军坚强无敌的力量究竟在什么地方呢？我想和同志们来谈谈这个问题。
    你们知道，中国人民解放军是一支无坚不摧、无攻不克的英雄军队。这支军队为什么是不可战胜的？它的力量的源泉是什么呢？国内外的一切反动派是看不清这个源泉的，他们往往以短视的眼光来低估人民军队的力量，这就使他们大大吃了苦头。人民解放军是在中国共产党和毛主席亲自领导教养下生长壮大起来的。它有着党的坚强领导，它忠于人民，与人民亲密结合。这就是人民解放军坚强力量的所在。毛主席早就指出：“这个军队之所以有力量，是因为所有参加这个军队的人，都具有自觉的纪律；他们不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合，而战斗的。紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨”。这个军队和中国历史上任何反动军队根本不同。旧军队是为官僚、地主、资本家服务的，是压迫劳动人民的工具，它的官兵之间和军民之间都是对立的，关系是极端恶劣的。因为它受人民仇视，得不到人民的支持，所以常打败仗。中国人民解放军是一种完全新型的人民军队，它有党和毛主席指示的明确的政治方向，它永远忠于人民的事业，知道为谁而战，为什么而战。和人民有着血肉的联系，处处受到人民的拥护和支持。因此，人民解放军就具有一往无前的精神，高涨的士气，和百战百胜的无敌力量。
    忠于祖国、忠于人民，是构成我们军队战斗力量的基本因素。因此，培养高度的政治觉悟，就成为我们军队建设最基本的问题，也就是对于我们每个青年战士首要的要求。必须培养青年战士对敌人具有高度的仇恨，对祖国、对人民、对社会主义事业具有无限的忠诚和热爱。有着高度的共产主义道德，和勇敢无畏的克服困难的精神。青年同志们经常要以革命先烈的光辉形象来教育和鼓舞自己，学习方志敏、恽代英、瞿秋白等青年领袖那样崇高的威武不能屈的革命气节，学习董存瑞、黄继光、刘胡兰等人民英雄那样英勇顽强，以身许国的英雄气概。许多青年同志都想成为英雄，为祖国立功，对祖国、对人民作出更多更大的贡献，这种志愿是很好的，值得鼓励的，但是不能设想，英雄行为是去找一个偶然的机会来“名扬天下”。只有那些为了人民利益，不顾一切艰难困苦勇往前进的人，只有那些具有高度政治觉悟，并为实现人民崇高理想而坚决斗争的人，才能成就人民的英雄事业，才能为祖国和人民有所贡献。因此青年同志们应好好学习政治，关心国内外的大事，关心人民的事业，不断提高社会主义觉悟，不受资产阶级反动思想的影响与旧社会坏习惯的沾染。多多阅读为祖国和人民事业奋不顾身、英勇斗争的英雄人物的故事，以及有益的能够启发青年智慧的书籍，不要去看那些黄色的、消磨青年志气的淫秽荒诞的书报。青年们要下定决心，为了人民的事业，在自己的战斗岗位献出自己整个身心。只有我们国家的青年一代，是英勇无畏，不怕艰苦，具有自我牺牲精神和高尚道德品质的人，那末我们的军队成员才会有更高的政治素质和顽强的战斗精神。只有这样的成员组成的军队，才是无敌的军队，我们的人民解放军就是这种军队的典范。
    现代军队要求每一个战士要有高度的组织性和纪律性，在各兵种协同作战时，士兵的每一个动作，必须准确、迅速，服从指挥，执行命令。因为现代化的军队是用机械装备起来的，它的组织制度也必须和精密的机器一样十分严密，所有成员都要严格按照条令行事。只有这样，整个军队才能像一部机器一样，运转自如，合拍地进行训练和战斗。不然由于一个人的过失，常常会影响战斗的胜利。这种优良的品质，除在入伍后加强锻炼外，还须要在入伍前建立一定的基础。现在我国正在进行社会主义建设，青年们在工厂、矿山、农村、机关、学校及其他各种群众组织里，都有机会来锻炼自己的组织性和纪律性。只要你们经常注意这点，你们就一定能在这方面提高自己。
    现代化军队的战士须要有强壮的体格，如果平时不加强体格锻炼，在紧张激烈的战斗中，将会遇到困难的。战斗的胜败，常常看谁能忍受与克服困难，坚持到最后的时间。因此强的体格对于军队来说是十分重要的。许多青年都希望当空军和海军，这种志愿当然是很好的，但是飞行员是要有强壮健全的身体，水兵也需要强健的身体，没有体格这个条件，单是志愿是不成的，而强健的体格只有在平时的锻炼中才能培养出来。有些青年爱国热情很高，但不注意锻炼身体，身体条件不够，也就不能实现参军保卫祖国的志愿。在过去由于反动派的压迫和摧残，人民生活非常痛苦，青年的身体一般都不够坚强，人家称我们是“东亚病夫”。新中国的青年因为物质条件改善，精神上又极其愉快，情形已有改变，但是，锻炼仍然是必要的，青年们一定要响应毛主席“三好”的号召，踊跃参加体育活动，参加准备劳动卫国制的锻炼，成为身强力壮的青年。
    青年平时还要注意学习文化科学和军事知识，为掌握现代军事技术打下基础。现代化军队建设，要求每个军官通晓本部门的军事知识，每个兵士要精通自己手中的武器，而这些技术又都是相当复杂的。如果没有一定的文化科学水平，不认识字，不会写，不会算，那末学习起来就困难得多。不懂得数学、物理的知识，当一个炮兵观察员，或者飞行员、水兵、工程兵，都是有困难的。当指挥员，要求的文化科学知识更高。青年们要抓紧时机，利用工作中可能的条件，用顽强的精神，去学习文化。同时，还要学习军事知识，培养对于军事科学的兴趣，和掌握初步军事技术。在这方面，军队有责任帮助地方青年组织学习。大家应根据环境和条件的可能，采取不同的方式来进行学习。在工厂、机关、学校中，更广泛开展国防体育活动，如机械操、田径、射击、投掷手榴弹、军事野营、爬山、防空、行军、武器讲解、火线救护、游泳、划船等。在有条件的地区，还可重点展开滑翔、跳伞、航海、驾驶摩托车等活动。在高级中学以上学校，还要通过军事训练，系统的学习军事知识和技术。在农村中，通过民兵和预备役的集训，进行军事知识的学习。
    总之，加强我国的国防建设，保卫祖国的社会主义事业，需要全国人民，特别是青年同志在各个工作岗位上努力。
    最后，我还要对军队青年讲几句话。今天参加大会的有一百五十五位中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的青年积极分子。你们代表了人民军队中的全体青年，来参加这个大会。你们要好好地向到会青年汇报工作，听取他们的经验，并虚心向他们学习。由于全国人民热爱自己的军队，他们给予军队青年以崇高的荣誉，这是人民对于军队青年的鼓励和希望。你们一定不要骄傲，要永远和全国青年全国人民在一起，保卫我们伟大的祖国，保卫人民的和平劳动，严守岗位，时刻保持战斗准备，为解放台湾和保卫祖国而贡献自己的一切。
    同志们！建设社会主义是光荣伟大的事业，我们目前所做的工作和所获得的成绩，都是极其初步的。我们要做的事情还很多。青年积极分子同志们要认识自己责任的重大和岗位的光荣，永远不要骄傲自满。要听从党的领导，要亲密团结群众，努力学习，老老实实，勤勤恳恳的工作，在建设和保卫
  祖国社会主义事业中大显身手。青年们不仅要成为社会主义的积极建设者，而且要做我们伟大祖国的光荣保卫者。　（新华社）
