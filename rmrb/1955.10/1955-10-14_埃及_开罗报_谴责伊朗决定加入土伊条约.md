Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 13th, TASS dispatch: The "Al-Ahram" newspaper, in commenting on the news of the Iranian government's decision to join the Turkish-Iraqi pact, wrote that this pact was concluded as a means of dragging Arab countries, primarily Egypt, into the imperialist policy of pacts and military blocs. However, Egypt and other Arab countries thwarted this plan, and they took a different path.

In an editorial, "Al-Ahram" said that the people of Arab countries do not approve of the Western countries' policy of establishing blocs. If this or that Eastern country joins any Western military bloc, this is a practice that disregards the will of the people.

    埃及“开罗报”
    谴责伊朗决定加入土伊条约
    新华社十三日讯　塔斯社开罗十二日讯：“开罗报”在评论关于伊朗政府决定参加土耳其—伊拉克条约的消息时写道，这个条约是被当作一种把阿拉伯国家，首先是埃及拉入帝国主义的条约和军事集团政策的手段而缔结的。可是埃及和其他阿拉伯国家使这种计划遭到了挫折，它们走了另一条道路。
    “开罗报”在一篇社论中说，阿拉伯各国人民不赞成西方国家建立集团的政策。假如这个或那个东方国家参加了任何西方的军事集团，这就是不顾人民的意志的作法。
