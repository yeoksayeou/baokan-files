Advocate a Simple Lifestyle and Develop People's Savings
Yang Peixin

Developing people's savings is an important way to accumulate funds for socialist industrialization. In the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy in our country, it was proposed: "Among the broad masses of people across the country, we should advocate a simple lifestyle, cherish public property, and actively participate in savings and purchase public bonds." The people of the whole country should respond to the call of the state and actively participate in savings.

During the first Five-Year Plan in the Soviet Union, the people tightened their belts and even saved on education expenses to complete the country's industrialization. We should also learn from the Soviet Union, advocate a simple lifestyle, and actively participate in people's savings. It is both necessary and beneficial for the country and the people that the people save a portion of their monetary purchasing power, which the state then invests in industrial construction to better meet the needs of the people in the future. By the end of 1954, the total savings of urban and rural people in our country had reached more than 1.6 billion yuan, which played a significant role in our socialist construction. However, compared to the capital needs of our socialist industrialization, this is not yet a lot, and the people of the whole country need to continue to actively participate in savings.

Developing people's savings can also help workers and staff plan their lives in a systematic way and help individual farmers and handicraftsmen accumulate funds to develop production. The living standards of workers and staff in our country are rising day by day, and there is labor insurance or free medical care systems to prevent disasters and illnesses. However, workers and staff should still save in order to plan their lives systematically. This will not only accumulate currency to purchase higher-value durable goods to better meet the needs of life, but also solve children's education expenses and other unexpected expenses. Some workers and staff spend their wages without any planning, and when there are unexpected expenses, they ask the administration or the trade union for relief or loans, which encourages personal waste and increases the burden on the state. This phenomenon is not good.

In contrast, there is a cotton weaving cooperative in Beijing with 72 members. In the past, the cooperative had to allocate a sum of money each year to solve the needs of members for loans for winter cotton clothes, children's education expenses, etc., which affected the development of production. Later, the cooperative promoted a simple lifestyle, and more than 50 people participated in savings. Not only did it not reduce the standard of living, but after eight or nine months, 20 people in the cooperative used their savings to buy bicycles or watches. More importantly, workers planned their lives in a systematic way with the help of savings, stabilized their production mood, and no longer used funds for the development of production for living expenses.

The accumulation of funds by individual farmers and handicraftsmen is even more directly conducive to the development of agricultural and handicraft production. Although the state provides a large number of loans for agricultural production, the funds for agricultural production should mainly rely on the farmers themselves to raise and accumulate. In recent years, the monetary income of farmers has been increasing, which is a good phenomenon; but if it cannot be well arranged and used, it will not be possible to guarantee the capital needs for continuous agricultural production. It is necessary to develop the savings business of state banks and credit cooperatives in order to effectively help farmers to reasonably arrange production and life. Zhang Rongde, a farmer from Taiping Village, Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, deposited 220 yuan from selling grain in the bank in the winter of 1954. Thirty yuan was deposited for one month, ready to be withdrawn for the Spring Festival; 110 yuan was deposited for three months, ready to be withdrawn for production when transplanting seedlings; and the rest of the money was used to buy ammonium sulfate and cloth. This is a good example of farmers using savings to arrange production and life. After the implementation of the unified purchase of grain, cotton, and oil, currency is concentratedly paid to farmers. If savings are not developed, it will encourage farmers to spend money indiscriminately and affect agricultural production. After two years of promoting farmers' savings during the peak season in 1953 and 1954, party committees in various places deeply realized that savings are indeed a very good thing for the country, especially for farmers. In places where savings are well-managed, production funds are well-arranged, and there are not many difficulties in spring plowing in the following year.

Not everyone fully understands the significance and role of savings. Some people say: "My monthly income has no surplus after expenses, and I have no ability to save." Some people do spend all their monthly wages every month, leaving no money left; but this does not mean that they have no ability to save, but only that they have no plan for spending money. If there is a plan for spending money, there will always be some spare money left. It is necessary to link thrift with savings, put forward a plan for monthly savings, and deposit a portion of the money in the bank when you get paid. Some people say: "No matter how convenient it is to deposit and withdraw from the bank, it is not as convenient as putting it in your own drawer or pocket." If you only consider the convenience of using money, it is of course more convenient to put it in your pocket, but this is easy to waste; and the state cannot use this money for production. Some people say: "I don't save much money, it's not worth it." This idea is also wrong. The characteristic of savings is to accumulate little into much. There is a worker named Li Hu (now a staff member) in Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, a family of eight, who has participated in savings since 1950. He relied on savings to buy bicycles and watches, and now he still has 900 yuan in savings. This shows that as long as you have the habit of saving, no matter how little money you save each time, the amount of savings will increase day by day. Some people say: "Saving is saving money, does the working class still have to develop the habit of saving money? Still eat interest? Still buy prize-linked savings bonds, wanting to win the lottery?" It should be pointed out that it is now beneficial to the country and oneself for the working class to save money, and it is more of a contribution to the country than those who do not save in the bank. It is not shameful, but glorious. As long as the saver's money does not come from exploitation, and his purpose is not to buy land, lend money, hoard goods, or engage in exploitative operations, then the larger the amount he saves, the more glorious it is. Because this shows that he has responded to the call of the state and established a habit of thrift and economy. Banks and credit cooperatives pay a certain reasonable interest to savings account holders, and this interest is a material reward. As long as the saver's purpose is not only for interest, and he does not overemphasize interest, but mainly aims to support the country's socialist industrialization, this material reward is also appropriate. Prize-linked savings is a way of saving, which is to convert interest into bonuses, which is also a material reward. As long as the bank pays attention to ensuring that the prize amount is not too large and the scope of rewards is wider when handling it, and pays attention to not catering to and fostering some backward speculative and opportunistic psychology when conducting publicity, it can be handled. The Soviet Union still retains prize-linked bonds and prize-linked savings as a way of issuing bonds and savings.

The key to developing people's savings is to do a good job in publicity and establish people's savings habits. At present, many leaders of units realize the importance of savings. They realize the benefits of reduced borrowing and stable lives for workers and staff after savings are developed, and they also realize the benefits for the country. Therefore, they actively carry out savings publicity and mobilization work (such as Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, State Planning Commission, etc.). But there are also many units that think that savings publicity is the bank's business. In fact, savings is by no means just the bank's business, but the business of all the people, and leaders should especially take the lead in conducting publicity and advocating it. Savings publicity and mobilization work must be carried out under the leadership and supervision of the party committee. In October 1953, the former Northwest Bureau mobilized to carry out a savings campaign among organs, troops, and workers, and in just over two months, by the end of the year, the total amount of savings in the entire region increased by 1.22 times compared with the end of 1952, and people's savings habits were also established. This is worthy of learning and promotion in various places.

The savings staff of the People's Bank should continuously improve their service attitude, and truly make deposits and withdrawals convenient and efficient, in order to meet the development of the people's savings business. Many good examples of serving the people have emerged among the bank's savings staff. However, in many places, the service attitude of the bank's savings staff is not good, causing savers to wait for a long time and delay their time. The bank's savings staff need to continuously improve their service attitude, improve the deposit and withdrawal procedures for savings, and learn to correctly carry out savings publicity work for the masses.

After the promulgation of the first Five-Year Plan, in addition to working hard and increasing production and practicing economy in their own posts, the people of the whole country should also respond to the call proposed in the first Five-Year Plan, maintain a hardworking and simple style, and strive to participate in people's savings, accumulate funds for our country's socialist industrialization, in order to facilitate the completion and overfulfillment of the first Five-Year Plan.

    提倡朴素的风气，发展人民储蓄事业 
    杨培新
    发展人民储蓄事业是为社会主义工业化积累资金的重要方法之一。我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划中提出：“在全国人民群众中，应该提倡朴素的风气，爱护公共财产，踊跃储蓄和认购公债。”全国人民都应该响应国家的号召，积极参加储蓄。
    苏联人民在第一个五年计划时期，节衣缩食，甚至节省教育经费，以完成国家的工业化。我们也应该学习苏联，提倡朴素风气，积极参加人民储蓄事业。人民把一部分货币购买力储蓄起来，由国家投入工业建设，以便将来更好地满足人民的需要，这对国家和人民都是必要的有利的。一九五四年底，我国城乡人民的储蓄总额已达到十六亿余元，对于我国社会主义建设事业发挥了很大的作用。但是，这同我国社会主义工业化的资金需要来比，还不是很多的，需要全国人民继续踊跃地参加储蓄。
    发展人民储蓄，还可以帮助工人和职员有计划地安排生活，帮助个体农民和手工业者积蓄资金发展生产。我国工人和职员的生活水准是日益上升的，而且有劳动保险或公费医疗制度，防备灾害疾病。但是，工人和职员为了有计划地安排生活，还应该进行储蓄。这样一方面可以积蓄货币来购买价值较高的耐久用品，更好地满足生活的需要；另一方面还可以解决子女教育费、以及其它意外支出。有些工人和职员拿到工资就毫无计划地花，一有意外支出，便向行政或工会要求救济或借款，既助长个人的浪费，又增加国家的负担。这种现象是不好的。
    和这相反，北京有一个棉织生产合作社，有社员七十二人，过去社内每年要拨出一笔资金来解决社员冬天制棉衣、子女教育费等借支的需要，影响了生产的发展。后来在社内提倡朴素风气，有五十多人参加了储蓄，不但没有降低生活水准，而且八、九个月后，全社有二十个人用储蓄款买了自行车或手表。更重要的是工人借助储蓄有计划地安排了生活，安定了生产情绪，不再把发展生产的资金用于生活借支了。
    个体农民和手工业者积蓄资金，更是直接有利于发展农业和手工业生产。虽然国家对农业生产发放大量贷款，但是农业生产的资金主要还应依靠农民自己来筹集和积累。近年来农民的货币收入日益增多，这是好现象；但如果不能很好地安排使用，就不能保证农业不断增产的资金需要。必须发展国家银行和信用合作社的储蓄业务，才能有效地帮助农民来合理安排生产和生活。四川简阳县太平村农民张荣德，一九五四年冬把卖粮款二百二十元存入银行。其中三十元存一个月，准备春节提出用；一百一十元存三个月，准备插秧时提出用于生产；其余的钱买硫酸錏、布匹。这是农民运用储蓄安排生产和生活的好典型。在实行粮食、棉花、油料统购以后，货币集中付给农民，如果不发展储蓄，就会助长农民乱花钱，影响农业生产。经过一九五三年一九五四年两年推行旺季农民储蓄工作后，各地党委深深体会到：储蓄对于国家，特别是对于农民，确实是一件很好的事情。凡是储蓄办得好的地方，生产资金就安排得好，次年春耕困难也不多。
    对于储蓄的意义和作用，并不是每个人都完全了解的。有人说：“我每月的收入除去开销后就没有余钱，没有储蓄能力。”有些人确是每月工资每月用完，一个钱也不剩；但这并不能说明他没有储蓄能力，而只能说明他花钱没有计划。如果用钱有计划，就总会留一些备用钱的。必须把节约同储蓄联系起来，提出每月节约储蓄的计划，发薪时就存一部分钱到银行去。有人说：“银行存取再方便，也没有放在自己的抽屉里、口袋里方便。”如果光从用钱方便考虑，那当然是放在口袋里方便，但这样容易浪费；而且国家不能使用这笔钱来用于生产。有人说：“我存的钱不多，不顶事。”这种想法也是不对的。储蓄的特点就是积少成多。石景山钢铁厂有一个工人栗虎（现在是职员），一家八口人，一九五○年起参加储蓄，他依靠储蓄买了自行车、手表，现在还存有九百元。这说明只要有储蓄的习惯，每次存的钱再少，储蓄的数字就会日渐增多。有人说：“储蓄就是攒钱，工人阶级还要养成攒钱的习惯？还吃利息？还去买有奖储蓄券，想中彩票？”应该指出，现在工人阶级攒钱储蓄是有利于国家和自己，比不在银行储蓄的人对国家多一分贡献，不但不是可耻的，而且是光荣的。只要储蓄人的钱并不来自剥削，他的目的又不是为了买地、放债、囤积居奇、进行剥削经营，那末，他储蓄的数额越大就越光荣。因为这说明他响应了国家的号召，建立了俭朴节约的习惯。银行和信用合作社对储蓄户付给一定的合理的利息，这种利息是一种物质奖励。只要储蓄人目的不仅仅为了利息，并不过分计较利息，主要目的在于支持国家社会主义工业化，这种物质奖励也是应当的。有奖储蓄是储蓄的一种方式，是将利息折为奖金，同样是一种物质奖励，只要银行办理时注意到奖额不要过大、奖励的面宽些，进行宣传时注意不要迎合和助长某些落后的投机取巧心理，是可以办理的。苏联现在也还保有有奖公债和有奖储蓄，作为一种公债和储蓄方式。
    发展人民储蓄事业的关键是作好宣传工作，树立人民的储蓄习惯。目前有不少单位的领导同志认识到储蓄的重要性，他们体会到储蓄发展后借支减少、工人职员生活安定的好处，也认识到对于国家的好处，因此积极进行储蓄宣传和动员工作（如石景山钢铁厂、国家计划委员会等单位）。但也有不少单位认为储蓄宣传是银行的事。其实，储蓄决不只是银行的事，而是全体人民的事，领导人员尤应以身作则进行宣传和提倡。储蓄的宣传动员工作，必须在党委的领导和监督下进行。一九五三年十月，前西北局曾经在机关、部队、和职工群众中动员开展节约储蓄运动，仅仅两个多月，到年底，全区储蓄总额比一九五二年年底增加了一点二二倍，也树立了人民的储蓄习惯。这是值得各地学习、推广的。
    人民银行的储蓄人员应该不断改进服务态度，切实作到存取方便，办事快捷，来迎接人民储蓄事业的发展。银行储蓄人员中曾经出现不少为人民服务的好榜样。但是仍有不少地方的银行储蓄人员服务态度不好，使储蓄人等候很久，耽误时间。银行储蓄人员需要不断改进服务态度，改善储蓄的存取手续，并学会正确地对群众进行储蓄宣传工作。
    全国人民在第一个五年计划公布后，除了在本岗位上努力工作、增产节约外，还应该响应第一个五年计划中所提出的号召，保持艰苦朴素的作风，努力参加人民储蓄，为我国社会主义工业化积聚资金，以利于第一个五年计划的完成和超额完成。
