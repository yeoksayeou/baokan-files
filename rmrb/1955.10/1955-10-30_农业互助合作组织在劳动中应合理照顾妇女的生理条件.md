To the Editor:

    With the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, the enthusiasm of rural women in Laiyang Prefecture to participate in production has increased unprecedentedly. However, because some agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams do not adequately consider women's physiological conditions, phenomena such as women experiencing miscarriages, illnesses, or injuries due to overwork occur frequently. According to incomplete statistics from eight districts in Yexian County, 19 women had miscarriages due to overwork, two had premature births, and ten became ill or injured. Yu Fengying, a member of the Huoguang Fourth Cooperative in Luwang Township, Second District, was four months pregnant and pushed a waterwheel for a day, resulting in a miscarriage that evening. In the Xiaodian Village Agricultural Cooperative in Wandi District, Laiyang, four women had miscarriages in the first half of this year. In Heluo Township, Fourteenth District, six women experienced premature births or miscarriages during the spring drought resistance and summer harvest.

    There are various reasons for this phenomenon. On the part of the leaders of cooperatives and teams, they generally only focus on production and rarely care about women's physiological conditions. On the part of women, they generally lack health knowledge and do not pay enough attention to the necessary rest during menstruation and pregnancy. Some women lack a correct understanding of the meaning of gender equality, so they insist on competing with men in physical strength during labor; there are also a few women who have the simple idea of earning work points. In addition, some men still have the old consciousness of "male superiority and female inferiority," expressing dissatisfaction with equal pay for equal work for women and deliberately satirizing women who need rest during menstruation and pregnancy. For example, in Xincheng Township, Twelfth District of Yexian County, a woman surnamed Zhang was menstruating when a male cooperative member deliberately taunted her, saying, "Isn't there gender equality? Let me see you go down the well." As a result, this woman caught a cold going down the well and developed a serious illness, and she is still unable to participate in production.

    In order to change this situation and correctly utilize women's enthusiasm for labor, we must first enable the peasant masses to correctly recognize that "gender equality" means that women enjoy equal rights and obligations with men in politics and economics, and assume appropriate labor according to different physical conditions, rather than women doing whatever men do; we must stop some men from satirizing women who need rest, and educate some women not to compete with men in physical strength. Secondly, the leaders of cooperatives and teams should pay attention to women's physiological conditions so that women can get adequate rest during menstruation and pregnancy. Finally, the health departments should also go deep into the countryside to teach them scientific health knowledge to protect the health of mothers and the next generation.

### 农业互助合作组织在劳动中应合理照顾妇女的生理条件

    农业互助合作组织在劳动中应合理照顾妇女的生理条件编辑同志：
    随着农业互助合作运动的发展，莱阳专区农村妇女参加生产的积极性空前提高了。但是，由于某些农业生产合作社和互助组对妇女的生理条件照顾不够，以致妇女由于劳动过度而流产、致病或者受伤的现象经常发生。据掖县八个区不完全的统计，妇女因劳动过度而流产的有十九人，早产的有两人，致病受伤的有十人；二区路王乡火光四社社员于凤英怀孕四个月，推了一天水车，晚上就流产了。莱阳万第区小店村农业社今年上半年有四个妇女流产；十四区河洛乡在春季抗旱及夏收中，早产、流产的妇女有六名。
    造成这种现象的原因是多方面的：在社、组的领导人员方面，一般是只顾搞生产，而对于妇女的生理条件很少关心。在妇女方面来说，一般都缺乏卫生常识，对经期、孕期应有的休息注意不够。有些妇女对男女平等的意义缺乏正确的了解，因而在劳动中硬同男子比体力；还有少数妇女又有着单纯挣工分的思想。此外，某些男子还有着“男尊女卑”的旧意识，对妇女参加劳动同工同酬表示不满，故意讽刺在经期、孕期需要休息的妇女。如掖县十二区新城乡有一姓张妇女在经期，有一个男社员故意刺激她说：“不是男女平等吗？你下井我看看。”结果这位妇女下井受了凉，得了严重的疾病，到现在还不能参加生产。
    为了改变这种情况，正确地发挥妇女的劳动积极性，首先应该使农民群众正确地认识到“男女平等”是指妇女在政治上、经济上和男子享有平等的权利和义务，根据体力情况的不同，分别担负适当的劳动，而不是男的干什么，女的也要干什么；制止某些男子讽刺需要休息的妇女，教育某些妇女不要硬同男子比体力。其次，社、组的领导人员应注意照顾妇女的生理条件，使妇女在经期、孕期能够得到适当休息。最后，卫生部门也应该深入农村去把科学的卫生知识教给她们，以保障母亲和下一代的健康。　山东莱阳专署　谢梅林
