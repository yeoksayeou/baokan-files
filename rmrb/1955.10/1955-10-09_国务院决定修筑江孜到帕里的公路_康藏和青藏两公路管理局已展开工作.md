　　Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 8th. In order to further improve transportation conditions in the Tibet region and to continue providing relief to the Tibetan people in the Nyang Chu River valley who suffered from the 1954 floods, the State Council has decided to construct the highway from Gyantse to Phari using the work-for-relief method. The Tibet Local Government recently issued a notice to the Dzongs of Gyantse, Baihoi, and Phari, requesting local officials and headmen to assist in the preparations for road construction. The road construction headquarters has also been moved to the vicinity of Gyantse and has sent people to survey the route. According to preliminary surveys, the highway is approximately one hundred and fifty kilometers long, and the terrain along the route is relatively flat, making the construction relatively simple. The headquarters has decided to commence construction in October and strive to complete it in a short period.

　　Phari is located at the top of the grasslands in the Himalayan mountains, at an altitude of more than four thousand two hundred meters. It is a famous high-altitude city in Tibet and an intermediate transit station for trade between Yatung and major towns in Tibet.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 8th. The Kangzang Highway Administration and the Qingzang Highway Administration, established according to the "State Council's Decision on Transportation Issues in Tibet," have commenced work. Of the five hundred and fifty vehicles allocated by the Ministry of Communications to the Kangzang Highway Administration and the Qingzang Highway Administration this year, more than three hundred and fifty are already performing transportation tasks on the two highways. Motor vehicle drivers from Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Jiangsu and other places are driving new trucks on the two highways. Since the beginning of September, more than one hundred truckloads of tea, construction materials, medicines, and personnel supporting the construction of Tibet have been transported to Lhasa.

　　The two highway administrations have assumed the task of highway maintenance and management. The staff and equipment of the original maintenance engineering department of the First Engineering Bureau were transferred to the Kangzang Highway Administration on June 1st. The maintenance workers of more than one hundred road crews in various maintenance sections have been rushing to repair landslides, road surfaces, and bridges during the rainy season. The maintenance department of the Qingzang Highway Administration has also organized eight hundred road maintenance workers and a renovation engineering team of six hundred people. Road maintenance workers and renovation engineering teams have undertaken the maintenance task of more than one thousand kilometers from Golmud to Lhasa. During the rainy season, they repaired the road surface to ensure the normal traffic of the highway. The Qingzang Highway Administration also assisted the engineering troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in completing the majority of the roadbed, bridges, and the renovation project of the Yangbajing Stone Gorge on the Heihe to Lhasa section.

    国务院决定修筑江孜到帕里的公路
    康藏和青藏两公路管理局已展开工作
    新华社拉萨八日电　为了进一步改善西藏地区交通条件，并继续救济年楚河沿岸一九五四年遭受水灾的藏族人民，国务院决定采用以工代赈的方式修筑江孜到帕里的公路。西藏地方政府已在最近向江孜、白浩、帕里等宗发出了通知，要求当地的官员、头人等协助进行筑路准备工作。修路指挥部也已迁到江孜附近，并派人踏勘了路线。据初步勘察，这条公路全长约一百五十多公里，沿线地势平坦，工程比较简易，指挥部已确定在十月间动工修筑，争取在短期内完工。
    帕里位于喜马拉雅山区草原顶部，拔海四千二百多公尺，是西藏著名的高寒之城，也是亚东和西藏各主要城镇间进行贸易的一个中间转运站。
    新华社拉萨八日电　根据“国务院关于有关西藏交通运输问题的决定”成立的康藏公路管理局和青藏公路管理局已经展开工作。交通部今年拨给康藏公路管理局和青藏公路管理局的五百五十辆汽车中，已有三百五十多辆在两条公路上执行运输任务。来自辽宁、黑龙江、山东、江苏等地的汽车驾驶员，正驾驶着新的载重汽车在两条公路上奔驰。从九月初到现在，已把一百多车茶叶、建筑器材和药品，以及支援西藏建设的工作人员运到拉萨。
    两个公路管理局已担负起公路的养护和管理工作。第一工程局原养护工程处所属职工和设备，已在六月一日移交给康藏公路管理局，各养护段的一百多个道班的养护工人，在雨季中抢修了塌方、路面和桥梁。青藏公路管理局的养护部门也组织了八百名养路工人和一个包括六百人的整修工程队，养路工人和整修工程队已担负了噶尔穆到拉萨一千多公里的养护任务，在雨季中他们修整了路面，保证了公路的正常通车。青藏公路管理局还协助中国人民解放军工兵部队，完成了黑河到拉萨段的大部路基、桥梁以及羊八井石峡的整修工程。
