Mining Thin Coal Seams
By our reporter Fan Rongkang

"Pay attention to mining thin coal seams, increase the recovery rate, and reduce the loss of resources." This is one of the calls made to coal miners in China's First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy.

The workers of the Ping'an Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau have been striving to realize this call since 1954. In March of that year, the miners mined their first thin coal seam - the 1-meter seam of East 7th Road, Pit 1.

In such low thin coal seams, drilling, loading coal, and moving coal machines, all kinds of work in the coal mining process have to be done lying diagonally, which is unfamiliar to the workers who have always worked in thick coal seams; moreover, in thin coal seams, it is not pleasant to squat, sit, or lie diagonally on the cold bedrock for eight hours. However, miners who are constantly fighting against nature have never been afraid of difficulties. They feel proud to mine coal in such low coal seams. Communist Party member Li Xiwu is one of the miners most interested in thin coal seams. He led a group of coal loaders, always demanding to go to the most difficult places to mine coal, and created loading records that they had never had in thick coal seams. Moving coal machines in the limited space of thin coal seams is very difficult, and at that time they were still using coal machines for thick coal seams, which were large in volume, making the limited space even narrower. Moving a coal machine always took eleven or twelve hours, and they could not finish it within eight hours, which affected coal mining. Under such circumstances, the workers moving coal machines had every reason to emphasize the difficulties, but they first looked for problems from their own labor organization and working methods. In just a few days, they shortened the time for moving coal machines to within eight hours.

No matter how difficult the work in the thin coal seams was, the workers in the coal mining site of East 7th Road, Pit 1, safely and completely mined all the coal in this site ahead of schedule, and took the lead in realizing regular cyclic operations from beginning to end in the national coal mines, becoming a model for the national coal mines.

Since then, the proportion of thin coal seam sites in Anping Mine has increased rapidly. When I visited Ping'an Mine in September this year, the comrades of the technology section told me that seven of the twelve coal mining sections in the mine are now working in thin coal seams. This is a major change in the history of China's coal mines.

The history of China's coal mines in recent decades has been a history of imperialist plunder of China's underground resources. In any mine operated by imperialism, they would always pick and choose the easy ones to mine. Since the opening of the Fuxin coalfield, thin coal seams have never been touched, and the recovery rate of thick coal seams has only been about 30%, so a large amount of useful resources have been suffocated underground. Today, the people are managing the mines, and increasing the recovery rate has become the most important task. Every piece of coal is a share of light and heat in the national construction and should be taken out of the ground.

"Let's take Pit 1 of Ping'an Mine as an example!" Xu Zailian, Deputy Director of Fuxin Mining Bureau and Director of Ping'an Mine, said: "The thick coal seams of this inclined shaft have been mined, and the remaining ones are all thin coal seams below one meter. What should we do? Should we abandon the shaft, or should we mine these thin coal seams? Abandoning the shaft will not only prevent a lot of coal from being extracted, but it will also take one or two years to build another shaft, and it will cost a lot of money. If we mine it, the roadways are ready-made, the equipment is ready-made, and it only costs a little labor and depreciation costs, and we can produce coal immediately, which is hundreds of thousands of tons a year. The country needs coal so much, we can't abandon these thin coal seams!"

The idea of ​​mining thin coal seams has taken root in the minds of the workers of Ping'an Mine. They are familiar with working in coal seams one meter thick, and they are also familiar with operating in coal seams half a meter thick.

One day, I went to visit the coal mining site of West 11th Road, Pit 1. The old miner named Zhang Dongcheng led the way for me. We pushed open one air door after another, and walked along the quiet pedestrian roadway lying in the stratum to the endless depths.

Zhang Dongcheng is over fifty years old this year. He was one of the first old miners to come to Fuxin to mine coal. As he walked, he said: "The average height of the West 11th Road coal mining site we are going to is only half a meter, and the lowest place is only 0.35 meters. In the Puppet Manchukuo period, who would care about these coal seams! The coal left as roof support was also one meter thick."

"So, why mine such thin coal seams?" I wanted to hear Zhang Dongcheng's opinion on mining thin coal seams.

"Why? To cherish the country's resources." Zhang Dongcheng explained like teaching a child: "Coal is not comparable to wood! A tree grows in thirty or fifty years, but coal takes thousands of years. If we don't mine it this time, it will be closed underground, and no matter how much there is, we won't be able to mine it."

Soon, we arrived at the coal mining site of West 11th Road. It is more than a thousand meters away from the wellhead, and the vertical distance from the ground is also 300 meters. In this coal mining site, you have to tilt your neck even when you sit down, and a coal cutting machine is no longer possible to use. Sun Baohe, the head of the second coal mining section, was directing two drilling workers to drill holes in the coal wall. They couldn't straighten up, but they kept using their hands, chests, and feet to push the electric drill into the coal wall. We crawled past them and came to Sun Huanwen and other coal loaders. The coal loaders skillfully sent the coal to the coal machine lying sideways.

The coal machine suddenly stopped. Sun Huanwen muttered with dissatisfaction: "It stops all the time! It stops all the time!" Later, he heard the voice of the workers repairing the coal machine from afar, and he fell silent.

When the coal machine stops, the mine is particularly quiet. You can't even hear the smallest insect chirping, which really gives people a sense of being detached from the world. But this is definitely not "outside the world." In this deep part of the earth far from the ground, the workers are still fighting for socialism. Class leader Zhang Qinglin crawled over and told us that their class planned to produce 70 carts of coal yesterday, but they produced 71 carts. Today's plan is 45 carts, and they will definitely produce 50 carts by the time. The production plan for the whole section this month is to produce 3,000 tons of coal. It has been completed ahead of schedule, and a total of 4,000 tons can be produced by the end of the month.

Soon, the coal machine started turning again, and the interrupted coal loading work continued immediately.

When we got off work, we followed the miners to board the man car that picked them up from the well. A few minutes later, sunlight appeared on the walls of the roadway, and the miners' lamps paled in comparison. We returned to the ground again and saw the lovely blue sky.

The work of mining thin coal seams has gradually become standardized in Ping'an Mine. Now there are coal machines specially used in thin coal seams, there are shovels specially used in thin coal seams, and even the work clothes of the miners are different from those in thick coal seams. Lambskin is padded on the buttocks and knees to prevent the workers from catching a cold while working in the humid thin coal seams. Ping'an Mine has armed the workers ideologically, with equipment, and with labor protection equipment, and has launched a strong offensive against thin coal seams in order to realize the call of the First Five-Year Plan.

### 开采薄煤层

    开采薄煤层
    本报记者　范荣康
    “注意开采薄煤层，提高回采率，减少资源的损失”。这是我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划向煤矿工人们发出的号召之一。
    阜新矿务局平安矿的工人们，从一九五四年开始，就为实现这个号召而奋斗。那一年三月，矿工们开采了第一个薄煤层——一坑东七路一公尺层。
    在这样低矮的薄煤层里，打眼、装煤、挪运煤机，所有采煤过程的各种工作都要斜躺着进行，这对从来在厚煤层里工作的工人们说来，是不熟悉的；而且，在薄煤层里，八小时的时间始终蹲着、坐着或者斜躺在冰凉的底板岩层上，不是一件好受的事。然而，每时每刻都在同自然作斗争的矿工们从来就不是畏惧困难的人。在这样低矮的煤层里把煤采出来，使他们感到自豪。共产党员李锡武就是对薄煤层最有兴趣的矿工之一。他带领一组装煤工人，总是要求到作业条件最困难的地方去采煤，并且创造了他们在厚煤层里也不曾有过的装车纪录。在薄煤层有限的空间里挪运煤机是件很困难的事，而且当时他们采用的还是厚煤层的运煤机，体积大，使有限的空间更显得狭隘，挪一次运煤机总要十一、二个小时，八小时内说什么也干不完，这就影响了采煤。在这种情况下，挪运煤机的工人有充分的理由可以强调困难，可是，他们还是首先从自己的劳动组织，工作方法上来找毛病，没有经几天，就把挪运煤机的时间缩短到八小时之内。
    不管薄煤层里的工作多么困难，一坑东七路一公尺层采煤场子的工人还是安全地、全面地提前采完了这个场子里的煤，并在全国煤矿中首先实现了自始至终的正规循环作业，成为全国煤矿的榜样。
    这以后，安平矿薄煤层场子的比例迅速增加。今年九月，我去访问平安矿时，技术科的同志告诉我，现在全矿十二个采煤段中，有七个是在薄煤层里工作。这是我国煤矿历史上的一个重大变化。
    我国煤矿近数十年来的历史，是一部帝国主义掠夺我国地下资源的历史。在任何一个帝国主义经营的矿山里，都是挑肥丢瘦，拣好采的采。阜新煤田自开采以来，就没有动过薄煤层，厚煤层的回采率也只有百分之三十左右，大量有用的资源就这样被窒息在地下。今天，人民来管理矿井，提高回采率就成为最重要的任务，每一块煤都是国家建设中的一份光和热，都应该从地下拿上来。
    “拿平安矿一坑做例子吧！”阜新矿务局副局长兼平安矿矿长许在廉说：“这个斜井的厚煤层采完了，剩下的都是一公尺以下的薄煤层。我们 怎么办呢？是把井废了呢，还是采这些薄煤层？把井废了，不但许多煤拿不出来，另外建个井还要一、两年时间，还得花很大一笔资金。采下去呢，巷道是现成的，设备是现成的，只花一点人工费和折旧费，马上可以出煤，一年就是几十万吨。国家那么需要煤，说什么也不能把这些薄煤层丢掉呵！”
    必须开采薄煤层的思想，已经在平安矿工人们的思想里生了根。他们熟悉了在一公尺厚的煤层里工作，而且还熟悉了在半公尺厚的煤层里操作。
    一天，我去访问一坑西十一路采煤场子。替我带路的是一个名叫张栋成的老矿工。我们推开了一座座风门，沿着斜卧在地层里的、静得没有一点声息的人行巷道，向没有尽头的深处走去。
    张栋成今年五十多岁了，他是第一批来到阜新采煤的老矿工之一。一边走，他一边说：“咱们要去的西十一路采煤场子平均才半公尺高，矮的地方才零点三五公尺。要在伪满时期，这些煤有谁管呵！留个顶板扔掉的煤也有一公尺厚。”
    “那么，为什么要采这么薄的煤呢？”我想听听张栋成对开采薄煤层的意见。
    “为什么？为了爱惜国家的资源。”张栋成像教导小孩那样解释起来：“煤可比不得木材呵！一颗树，三十年、五十年就长起来了，煤可要千年万年。这回不采，给闭在地下了，多?也采不上来。”
    不久，来到西十一路采煤场子。这里离井口已经一千多公尺了，同地面的垂直距离也有三百公尺。在这个采煤场子里，连坐着也得歪着脖子，截煤机已经不可能采用了。第二采煤段段长孙宝和正指挥两个打眼工朝煤壁上打眼，他们直不起身子来，可还是一刻不停地用手抱、用胸顶、用脚蹬的办法，把电钻向煤壁上凿去。我们从他们的身旁爬过去，来到攉煤工孙焕文等人的身旁。攉煤工侧着身子、半躺着熟练地把煤送到运煤机里去。
    运煤机突然停下来。孙焕文不满意地嘀咕着：“老停！老停！”后来听到远处传来修理运煤机的工人传话的声音，也就不响了。
    运煤机一停，井下特别宁静。那怕是最小的虫鸣也听不到，真使人有置身世外之感。但这里决不是“世外”，在这远离地面的大地的深处，工人们一样在为社会主义奋斗。班长张庆林爬过来告诉我们，昨天他们的班计划出七十车煤，结果出了七十一车，今天的计划是四十五车，到时候准能出五十车。这个月全段的生产计划是出三千吨煤，现在已经提前完成了，到月底总共可以出四千吨。
    不久，运煤机重又转动起来，中断了的攉煤工作马上继续下去。
    下班的时候，我们随矿工登上来接他们出井的人车。几分钟后，车道的两壁出现了阳光，矿灯暗然失色。我们重又回到地面，见到蓝得可爱的天空。
    开采薄煤层的工作，在平安矿已经逐渐正规化了。现在有了专门在薄煤层里使用的运煤机，有了专门在薄煤层里使用的铁锹，连矿工的工作服也和厚煤层里的不同，屁股上、膝盖上都垫了羔羊皮，防备工人在潮湿的薄煤层里工作受寒。平安矿已经把工人们从思想上、设备上、劳动保护用品上武装起来，为实现第一个五年计划的号召，向薄煤层组织了强大的攻势。
