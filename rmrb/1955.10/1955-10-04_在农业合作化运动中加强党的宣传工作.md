Strengthening Party Propaganda Work in the Agricultural Cooperative Movement
Hong Yuping

Party propaganda work in rural areas has been greatly strengthened through the publicity campaigns for the General Line, agricultural collectivization, and the unified purchase and sale of grain. However, there is still a noteworthy issue in the current rural propaganda work: many township and village workers only talk about empty “grand principles” when publicizing the Party's policies to the masses; or they simply read the propaganda content arranged by higher authorities or the resolutions and instructions of higher authorities to the masses verbatim. For example, when publicizing the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation, some workers always repeat the points summarized in the Party Central Committee's resolutions on mutual aid and cooperation and other documents, such as “unified land management” and “rational use of labor,” verbatim. When talking about the benefits of the unified purchase and sale of grain, they simply recite the "five benefits"… As a result, even they themselves are tired of talking about it; some even complain, "What's the point of talking about superiority? Hasn't it been talked about before?" Of course, the masses don't like to listen to this kind of propaganda, and some people call it "speaking the language of cadres." What a profound irony!

What kind of result will such propaganda produce? In the work of rectifying agricultural production cooperatives, such a situation occurred: Instead of actively publicizing the Party's rectification policy based on local conditions, some workers simply read the principles stipulated by the higher-level Party committee to the masses, plus empty political mobilizations such as "taking the socialist road." As a result, the masses could not correctly understand the Party's rectification policy. Some cooperative members, upon hearing that it was "voluntary" and could be "contracted," said: "The Party's words can't be wrong. Let those who want to withdraw from the cooperative do so quickly. It's better to have those who are wavering leave sooner rather than later!" Some people who were originally hesitant but did not want to withdraw from the cooperative decisively also quickly said, "If you allow me to withdraw, I will withdraw!" In this way, it seems that the rectification of the cooperatives was to "rectify" certain cooperative members out; to "contract" certain cooperatives. There was no talk of vigorously consolidating and preparing for development. This was obviously contrary to the policy of rectification, but these comrades complained, "This policy cannot be promoted!" Some people really dared not promote it. Once, I passed by a village and saw several women surrounding a township worker, discussing the collapse of a certain cooperative and how inconvenient it was to join the cooperative. The comrade only repeatedly said to the women, "This is a rumor!" However, when the women asked him many specific questions, he could not answer any of them and could only talk about his "grand principles." The women were indeed discussing some hearsay rumors, and their questions were based on rumors, which were easy to clarify. But because this comrade only knew how to talk about empty principles and did not understand or analyze the specific situation, he could not even refute some ridiculous rumors.

Our rural life is so rich and colorful, and the Party's various policies are so actively supported by the broad masses of farmers. Why is it that some people's propaganda is so empty and weak?

Some people say it is because township and village workers have low cultural levels and are not as eloquent as intellectuals; others think the propaganda content is "old hat"; or they emphasize that this is to grasp the principles...

Are these really the reasons for empty and weak propaganda?

When Tangxia District, Ruian County, Zhejiang Province, Baotian Township started the rectification work, the township workers did not know how to publicize the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation. When studying the work, some comrades took out documents to read. Later, Zheng Naigen, the district party secretary, came to inspect the work and invited several cooperative and township workers to hold a forum. Comrade Zheng Naigen was very familiar with the local situation. As soon as people were seated, he used the actual examples of some bad fields turning into good fields to inspire everyone to talk freely about the superiority of the cooperative. So people started discussing it: some said that someone's 1.7 mu of land used to have grass taller than rice. At that time, no one was interested in planting such bad land. Since joining the cooperative, there are more people and more strength. A lot of river mud was carried in. Last year, only a few dozen kilograms of wheat were harvested, but this year, 200 kilograms were harvested. Some said that someone not only had bad land but was also lazy. Since joining the cooperative, both the land and the person have turned over. The land has become better, and the person has become more diligent. Now, he is very concerned about the affairs of the cooperative. In this way, starting from production and talking about the family life of cooperative members, many things that seemed small, ordinary, and unnoticeable, Comrade Zheng Naigen inspired and guided everyone to talk about. The superiority of the cooperative was specifically and vividly displayed through these many "small things." What moved everyone the most was: one cooperative member was injured in his leg when harvesting early rice last year. He said that if there was no cooperative, let alone working to earn points, he would have to hire someone to harvest his own early rice. However, the cooperative assigned him the light work of pulling dry seedlings and gave him 50 work points, and subsidized him 30 work points for medical expenses. He said that even his own brothers would not treat him so well. Finally, Comrade Zheng Naigen summarized the facts that everyone had talked about and asked the township workers whether these things had been summarized before. They said embarrassedly: "We have forgotten some of them. There are really many things to say!" It turned out that their previous summaries of the cooperative were mostly based on the articles in the documents. Very little attention was paid to these specific "small things." Comrade Zheng Naigen smiled and said: "The document is a weapon to guide our work, not something to be recited as scripture. What we talked about tonight is the superiority of our agricultural production cooperative. Let's use these superiorities that everyone has personally experienced to publicize it from house to house!"

The masses not only like to listen to such propaganda, but also compete to put forward more examples while being enlightened and educated, enriching and enriching the propaganda content. And these propaganda contents are precisely the specific things of the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives summarized by the Party Central Committee.

It can be seen from this that promoting mutual aid and cooperation will not necessarily be an "old hat," the question is how we promote it. If you say these few words this year, and you still say these few words next year, then you are destined to be an "old hat." But if you, like Comrade Zheng Naigen, proceed from the actual situation at the time and place, then this kind of propaganda will not only not be an "old hat," but will become richer and more convincing.

Is empty and weak propaganda due to grasping principles? No, grasping principles and empty conceptual propaganda are not the same thing at all. The Party's policies and guidelines have always been concrete and vivid, starting from reality. Therefore, only by going deep into real life, carefully analyzing the actual situation, and then conducting specific publicity and implementation based on the actual situation, can it be considered a true grasp of the policy and guidelines, and a grasp of the principles.

Is it because the cultural level of district and township workers is low, so they can only recite according to the documents? The low cultural level of district and township workers will certainly bring certain difficulties to propaganda work; but what plays a decisive role here is not the level of education, but whether the workers' connection with the masses is close, and whether they go deep into real life. For example, in Haian Township, Tangxia District, Ruian County, the cultural level of district and township workers is not high, but they can deeply understand the ideological situation and existing problems of cooperative members, team members, and individual farmers, and then publicize the policy of rectification, the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation (they summarized more than a dozen superiorities based on the local situation), and solve specific problems in the rectification (for example, some cooperative members were unwilling to take out fertilizer because the fertilizer was not discounted, which affected the production of the cooperative. The township workers immediately grasped the solution to this problem). In this way, the work is done well.

Where is the reason? It should be found in the leadership of the county party committee over propaganda work and the work style of the county party committee and the prefectural party committee.

First of all, a few county party committees and propaganda departments do not pay attention to propaganda work. The county party committee rarely seriously studies propaganda work. The main staff of the propaganda department are often drawn to be the heads of base point groups. The county party committee does not specifically deploy propaganda work when deploying the central work, or does not check the propaganda work that serves the central work. The staff of the propaganda department also often use the method of abandoning the business of their own department to carry out the central work, rather than using the method of strengthening propaganda work to serve the central work. The propaganda department does not summarize and promote good propaganda work experience. Township, village, and even district workers mostly grow up from the masses. They are familiar with the life of the masses, understand the ideological feelings of the masses, and many of them are good at using the concrete and vivid things in the life of the masses to publicize the Party's policies and guidelines. The district party secretary Zheng Naigen mentioned earlier is a good example. Unfortunately, such a good propaganda method may not attract the attention of the county party committee.

Secondly, many leading members of the county party committee often instruct the staff below to understand the spirit of the Party's policies and guidelines and to actively implement the Party's policies and guidelines when deploying work to the lower levels. This is undoubtedly correct; unfortunately, they often forget to instruct further, what is the spirit of the Party's policies and guidelines, how can we more deeply and specifically understand the spirit of the Party's policies and guidelines, and what methods should we use to actively implement the Party's policies and guidelines. The above hastily deployed to the lower level, and the lower level also hastily promoted to the masses.

Finally, a few leading members of the county party committee and the prefectural party committee are accustomed to speaking in the tone of "Party eight-legged essay" when summarizing work or making reports, and many grassroots workers also learn to speak to the masses in the tone of "Party eight-legged essay." It should be noted that people do not regard this tendency of "Party eight-legged essay" that is divorced from reality and the masses as a serious problem in propaganda work. If you force an individual farmer to join the cooperative today, someone may come out to criticize and stop you; but if you only say a few empty words of "superiority," then no one may come out to criticize you and stop you. However, it should be known that coercion and command often start with empty and weak propaganda.

Marxism-Leninism is a weapon to solve practical problems starting from reality, so it is concrete, vivid, and militant. Not starting from reality, not solving practical problems, violates the most fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism. Those comrades who have been infected with the bad habit of "Party eight-legged essay" should use this principle to examine and demand their own work.

    在农业合作化运动中加强党的宣传工作
    洪禹平
    党在农村中的宣传工作，经过总路线、农业合作化以及粮食统购统销的宣传，有了很大的加强。但是，目前农村宣传工作中也还有一个值得注意的问题，那就是：不少乡、村工作人员在向群众宣传党的政策时，只会讲一套空空洞洞的“大道理”；或者把上级布置的宣传内容或上级的决议指示原封不动地念给群众听。比如宣传互助合作的优越性，有些工作人员总是反复地把党中央发布的关于互助合作的决议以及别的文件上总结好了的“土地统一经营”、“合理使用劳力”等几点照样念给群众听。要讲粮食统购统销的好处，就简单地背诵一下“五利”……。这样，连他们自己都讲腻了；有的甚至抱怨说：“还讲什么优越性呢，不是早就讲过了吗？”这样的宣传，群众当然不爱听，有些人把这种宣传叫做“说干部话”。这是多么深刻的讽刺啊！
    这样的宣传会产生什么样的结果呢？在整顿农业生产合作社的工作中，就发生过这样的情况：有些工作人员不是根据当地的具体情况积极地宣传党的整社方针，而只是把上级党委规定的几条原则向群众念一念，加上“走社会主义道路”等等空洞的政治动员，结果群众就不能正确地理解党的整社方针，有些社员听说要“自愿”，可以“收缩”，就说：“党的话当然不会错，要退社的人快让他退吧，心魂不定的人早退了早干净！”有些原来有些犹疑，但并不想坚决退社的人也就赶紧说：“你们允许退，我就退啦！”这样一来，好像整社就是为了把某些社员“整”出去；把某些社“收缩”掉，根本谈不上大力巩固和准备发展了。这显然是违背了整社的方针的，但这些同志反而叫苦道：“这方针政策宣传不得啊！”有的人也就真的不敢宣传了。有一次，我路过一个村子，看见几个妇女围着一位乡工作人员，纷纷议论某个社垮台了，入了社怎样不方便等等。这位同志只是连声向妇女们说：“这是谣言！”可是，当妇女们向他提出许多具体问题的时候，他却一个也回答不了，只好讲他的“大道理”。这些妇女们议论的确实都是一些道听途说的谣言，她们的问题也是根据谣言提出来的，也是很容易解释清楚的，但由于这位同志只会讲空洞的道理，对具体情况了解不够，分析不够，结果就连一些很荒唐的谣言也驳斥不了。
    我们的农村生活是这样丰富多采，党的各项方针政策又是这样为广大农民群众所积极拥护，为什么有些人的宣传会这样空洞无力呢？
    有些人说是因为乡、村工作人员文化水平低，不像知识分子那样能说会道；有的则认为宣传内容“老一套”；或者强调这是为了掌握原则……。
    宣传空洞无力的原因果真就是这些吗？
    浙江瑞安县塘下区鲍田乡在整社工作开始时，乡工作人员们也不知道怎样宣传互助合作的优越性，在研究工作的时候，有的同志就拿出文件来念。后来区委书记郑乃艮同志来检查工作，请了几位社和乡的工作人员一起开了次座谈会。郑乃艮同志对当地情况摸得很熟，人们刚坐定，他便用当地有些坏田变好田的实际事例来启发大家漫谈社的优越性，于是人们纷纷议论开了：有的说，某人的一亩七分田以前草长得比稻还高，那时候，谁也没兴头种那样的坏田，自从入了社，人多力量大，挑了很多河泥倒进去，去年种麦子还只收几十斤，今年就收了两百斤。有的说，某人不光田坏，人也懒，入了社，田和人都翻了个身，田变好啦，人也变勤快啦，现在对社里的事很关心。这样，从生产谈起谈到社员的家庭生活，许多事情看来是细小、平常、不引人注意的，郑乃艮同志都启发和引导大家谈出来，社的优越性也就通过这许许多多的“小事情”具体生动地显示出来了。最使大家感动的是：有一个社员去年割早稻脚部受了伤，他说要是没有社，不用说干活挣分，自家的早稻也还得雇别人来割，可是社里分配他拔旱秧的轻活干，给他记了五十工分，还补助他三十工分作为医疗费。他说自己的亲兄弟也不会对他这样好。最后，郑乃艮同志把大家谈的事实总结了一下，就问乡工作人员们这些事以前总结过了没有，他们不好意思地说：“有的我们都忘了。要说这些事，实在很多哩！”原来他们以前作社的总结，也多是根据文件上的条文来
  “总结”的，很少注意这些具体的“小事情”。郑乃艮同志笑道：“文件是指导我们工作的武器，不能拿它当经来念，我们今晚谈的就是我们农业合作社的优越性，就拿这些大家都亲身体验到的优越性去挨家挨户地宣传吧！”
    这样的宣传，群众不仅爱听，而且在受到启发和教育的同时，还争相提出更多的事例，充实和丰富了宣传内容。而这些宣传内容也正是党中央所总结的农业生产合作社优越性的具体的东西。
    由此可见，宣传互助合作，并不一定会“老一套”，问题是在于我们怎样去宣传。如果你今年是这几句话，明年也还是这几句话，那就注定要“老一套”了。但如果你也像郑乃艮同志那样从当时当地的实际情况出发，那末这种宣传非但不会“老一套”，而且会越来越丰富，越来越有说服力量。
    空洞无力的宣传是不是由于要掌握原则呢？不是的，掌握原则和空洞的概念化的宣传根本不是一回事。党的方针、政策从来都是从实际出发的具体而生动的，因而也只有深入实际生活，细致地分析了实际情况，然后根据实际情况进行具体的宣传和贯彻，才算是真正的掌握方针政策，掌握原则。
    是不是因为区、乡工作人员文化水平低，只能照文件背诵呢？区、乡工作人员文化水平低，当然会给宣传工作带来一定的困难；但在这里起决定作用的不是文化水平的高低，而是工作人员同群众的联系是否密切，是否深入实际生活。比如瑞安县塘下区海安乡，区、乡工作人员们的文化水平也不高，但是他们能深入地了解社员、组员以及单干农民的思想情况和存在的问题，然后宣传整社方针、政策和互助合作的优越性（他们根据当地的情况总结出十几条优越性），并解决整社中的具体问题（例如有的社员因肥料未折价不愿拿出肥料，影响了社的生产，乡工作人员即抓紧解决这个问题）。这样工作就做得好。
    原因在哪里呢？应该从县委对宣传工作的领导状况以及县委、地委的工作作风方面去找。
    首先是少数县委和宣传部门不重视宣传工作。县委会上很少认真地研究宣传工作，宣传部门的主要工作人员经常被抽去做基点组组长，县委在布置中心工作时，不具体布置宣传工作，或者对为中心工作服务的宣传工作不进行检查。而宣传部门的工作人员也常常用丢掉本部门的业务的办法去进行中心工作，不是用加强宣传工作的办法去为中心工作服务。宣传部门对于好的宣传工作经验，也不加以总结、推广。乡、村以至区的工作人员，大多是从群众中生长起来的，他们熟悉群众生活，了解群众的思想感情，其中有不少人是善于运用群众生活中的具体的生动的事物来宣传党的政策方针的。前面所谈的区委书记郑乃艮就是一个很好的例子。可惜的是，这样好的宣传方法并不一定能引起县委的注意。
    其次，不少县委的领导人员，在向下面布置工作时，常常指示下面的工作人员要领会党的政策方针的精神，要积极地贯彻党的政策方针等等。这无疑是正确的；可惜，他们往往忘记了再指示一下，党的政策方针的精神是什么，怎样才能更深刻更具体地领会党的方针政策的精神，用什么样的方法去积极地贯彻党的方针政策。上面囫囵吞枣地向下布置，下面也就囫囵吞枣地向群众作宣传。
    最后，少数县委、地委领导人员在总结工作，或做报告时，习惯用“党八股”的腔调讲话，不少基层工作人员也就学着用“党八股”的腔调对群众说话。应该引起注意的是，人们并不把这种脱离实际脱离群众的“党八股”的倾向，当作宣传工作中的一个严重问题。如果你今天强迫一个单干农民入社，可能就有人出来批评和制止你；但如果你仅仅讲了几句空空洞洞的“优越性”的话，那就不见得有人出来批评你和制止你了。然而，要知道，强迫命令往往是从空洞无力的宣传开始的。
    马克思列宁主义是从实际出发解决实际问题的武器，因而它是具体、生动、富有战斗性的。不从实际出发，不去解决实际问题，就违背了马克思列宁主义的最根本的原理。那些沾染了“党八股”恶习的同志们，应当用这个原理来检查和要求自己的工作。
