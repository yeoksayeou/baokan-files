    Guangxi is building a new type of ophthalmology research laboratory.
    A relatively new ophthalmology research laboratory began construction in Liuzhou City on the 6th and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. This research laboratory was decided to be built by the Guangxi Provincial People's Committee in order to provide better material conditions for Xu Yan'an and Tang Jidao, ophthalmologists at Liuzhou City People's Hospital, who have achieved initial success in the study of heterologous corneal transplantation, to continue their research work.
    According to the design drawings of the research laboratory, in addition to quiet research rooms and outpatient rooms, there will also be an animal dissection area and a surgical room for observation. Outside the glass wall of the surgical room is a trapezoidal observation platform that can accommodate dozens of medical workers or medical school interns to observe new ophthalmological techniques. Next to the observation platform is a small conference room, specially for observers to use for discussions and Q&A sessions after the observation.

    广西兴建一所新型眼科研究室
    一所设备比较新型的眼科研究室六日开始在柳州市动工兴建，将在今年年底完工。这所研究室是广西省人民委员会为使研究异种角膜移植术初步成功的柳州市人民医院眼科医师徐延安和唐继道能有较好的物质条件继续进行研究工作而决定筹建的。
    按照研究室设计的图样，研究室除辟有安静的研究房、门诊房外，还有动物解剖处和观摩用的手术房。手术房玻璃墙外面是梯形观摩台，可容几十个医务工作者或医学院实习生来观摩新的眼科医术。观摩台旁边，有一个小型会议室，专门为观摩者在观摩后进行讨论和答辩时用的。
