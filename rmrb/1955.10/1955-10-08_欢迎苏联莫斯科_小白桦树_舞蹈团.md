Welcome the Soviet Moscow "Beryozka" Dance Ensemble
Li Zhanwu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association

The Soviet Moscow "Beryozka" Dance Ensemble, led by the outstanding dancer Nadezhda Nadezhdina, which we have been eagerly awaiting, arrived in our capital, Beijing, yesterday. They will first go to Guangzhou to participate in the opening ceremony of the "Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction" and perform there, and then visit and perform in various parts of the country. Undoubtedly, this will make a significant contribution to further promoting the profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people and strengthening cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union; like the outstanding Soviet art groups that have come to China in the past, their rich and diverse dance art will be praised by the broad masses of the Chinese people and become an example for us to learn from.

The "Beryozka" Dance Ensemble is an art group with outstanding achievements and a high reputation in the Soviet Union and Europe. It was founded in 1948, and the thirty-six female dancers who make up the dance ensemble are all daughters of workers and collective farmers. Their beautiful dances are full of youthful vitality and exude the joy of people living in a happy country. Every step of their dance is like a beautiful song, singing the joy of life.

The maiden round dance "Beryozka" is their first creation. It expresses a unique and distinct national style. In front of the audience appears the beautiful Russian spring wilderness, the girls wearing floor-length skirts, holding tender birch branches in their hands, moving steadily, solemnly, and calmly. They sometimes meander like a path through the boundless wilderness, sometimes like the Yangtze River, with surging waves; sometimes they weave into a row of fences, and sometimes they form a small star shining in the clear sky. In the "Swan Dance," the girls wear white clothes with large sleeves and sky-blue skirts, with a ring inlaid with black gemstones on their right hands. In the final scene, they raise their arms and bend their fingers, like a flock of beautiful swans, floating leisurely on the blue waves. The "Collective Farm Polka" expresses the joy of collective farmers. The "Dorgizha Dance" expresses the playfulness of the girls. In the "Girls' Competition Dance," groups of girls full of enthusiastic youthful vitality dance happily, competing to see who dances better. All this shows that only a people full of optimism and love for life are the creators of this kind of art.

The artistic director of the dance ensemble, Nadezhda Nadezhdina, is an outstanding artist. She has dedicated her life to the research of folk dance art. When the dance ensemble performs in various parts of the Soviet Union, she studies folk dances through local folk art palaces and other institutions, studies the dances created by workers and collective farmers, and absorbs their essence to enrich her own creations. She once said: "The closer we get to the art of the people, the more life and vitality our performances will have. We never forget this in our work."

In the dance ensemble's repertoire, there are dances that express today's new life, as well as old dances that express ancient life. But Nadezhda Nadezhdina believes that in creating modern women's dances, it is necessary to pay attention to the fact that this kind of dance should be essentially different from the women's dances of the old era. In the past, due to the limitations of social conditions, women were in a subordinate position in daily life, and they also became "secondary figures" in dance. Now women, like men, have become the masters of life. They sing and dance joyfully, which is fundamentally different from the previous miserable situation. Precisely because of this, new women's dances must reflect the new and beautiful life, and reflect the new women—the brave, noble, and youthful new type of women's character.

The main strength of Soviet art lies in its content, which is rich in ideological and profound educational significance, as well as the beauty of its form. The dances performed by the "Beryozka" Dance Ensemble make people feel that only women who have gained true freedom and equal rights can express this kind of joyful modern women's dance that praises spring.

The "Beryozka" Dance Ensemble has performed in many provinces and cities in the Soviet Union, and has also been to many countries in Europe. Wherever they go, they bring youth and joy.

The arrival in our country of the Moscow "Beryozka" Dance Ensemble, led by Nadezhda Nadezhdina, Honored Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and Stalin Prize winner, brings the Chinese people the profound friendship of the great Soviet people and the most advanced artistic achievements of mankind, which makes the Chinese people and Chinese literary and art workers very excited.

The incomparably solid friendly and cooperative relations between the Chinese and Soviet people are developing day by day, and cultural exchanges between the two countries have become more frequent and close in recent years, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and brotherly friendship between the people of the two great countries. Chinese literary and art workers have always attached importance to learning the most advanced art of the Soviet Union. The arrival of the "Beryozka" Dance Ensemble is a good opportunity for our art workers to learn.

### 欢迎苏联莫斯科“小白桦树”舞蹈团

    欢迎苏联莫斯科“小白桦树”舞蹈团
    中苏友好协会总会副秘书长　李霑吾
    我们盼望已久的、由杰出的舞蹈家纳杰日金娜领导的苏联莫斯科“小白桦树”舞蹈团，已于昨日到达我国首都北京。她们将首先赴广州参加“苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会”开幕式，并在那里演出，然后到全国各地进行访问演出。无疑的，这对于进一步促进中苏两国人民之间的深厚友谊和加强中苏两国的文化交流将作出重大的贡献；和往年来华的卓越的苏联艺术团体一样，她们丰富多采的舞蹈艺术也将受到广大中国人民的赞美，并成为我们学习的榜样。
    “小白桦树”舞蹈团是一个有杰出成就的、在苏联和欧洲享有极高声誉的艺术团体。它成立于一九四八年，组成舞蹈团的三十六位女舞蹈家都是工人和集体农民的女儿。她们的优美的舞蹈充满着少女的青春活力，洋溢着生活在幸福国家里的人民的欢乐。她们的每一个舞步都像是一句美妙的歌，歌唱着生命的欢乐。
    少女环舞“小白桦树”是她们的第一个创作。它表现出独特的、鲜明的民族风格。在观众面前出现了俄罗斯春天的美丽的原野，少女们穿着及地的长裙，手里拿着青嫩的桦树枝，平稳、庄严而沉着地移动着。她们时而像一条小径蜿蜒穿过无边的原野，时而像长江大河，波涛澎湃；时而编成一排篱笆，时而组成一颗闪烁在晴空中的小星星。在“天鹅舞”中，少女们穿着大袖的白衣和天蓝色的裙子，右手上全戴着一个镶黑宝石的戒指。在最后的场面中，她们扬起手臂，弯着手指，像一队美丽的天鹅，在蓝色的波浪上怡然浮游。“集体农庄波尔卡舞”表现出集体农民的欢乐。“多尔吉沙舞”表现了少女们的调皮。在“少女竞演舞”中，一组组洋溢着热烈的青春活力的少女们愉快地舞蹈着，她们在比谁跳得更好。这一切都说明，只有充满乐观主义和热爱生活的人民，才是这种艺术的创造者。
    舞蹈团艺术领导人纳杰日金娜是一位杰出的艺术家。她把自己的一生都贡献给民间舞蹈艺术的研究工作。当舞蹈团在苏联国内各地表演时，她通过各地民间艺术宫等机构来研究民间舞蹈，研究工人和集体农民创作的舞蹈，吸取其中精华，以丰富自己的创作。她曾经说：“我们愈接近人民的艺术，我们的表演也就愈有生命，愈富于活力。这一点我们在工作中是永念不忘的。”
    在舞蹈团的表演节目中，有表现今天新的生活的舞蹈，也有表现古代生活的旧的舞蹈。但是纳杰日金娜认为：在创造现代女子舞蹈时，必需注意：这种舞蹈应当和旧时代的女子舞蹈有本质的不同。过去妇女由于社会条件的限制，在日常生活中处于从属地位，在舞蹈中也成为“次要人物”，现在妇女像男子一样成为生活的主人。她们欢乐地歌唱，舞蹈，和以前的悲惨情况根本不同。正因为如此，所以新的女子舞蹈就必需反映出新的、美好的生活，反映出新的妇女——勇敢的、高尚的、充满青春活力的新型妇女的性格。
    苏联艺术的主要力量，就在于它的内容富有思想性和深刻的教育意义，以及它的形式的优美。“小白桦树”舞蹈团所演出的舞蹈使人们感到：只有获得了真正自由和平等权利的妇女，才能表现出这种歌颂春天的愉快的现代女子舞蹈。
    “小白桦树”舞蹈团曾经在苏联许多省市演出过，也曾到过欧洲许多国家。她们走到那里，就把青春和欢乐带到那里。
    以俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国功勋艺术家，斯大林奖金获得者纳杰日金娜为首的莫斯科“小白桦树”舞蹈团这次来到我国，给中国人民带来了伟大苏联人民深厚的友谊和人类最先进的艺术成就，这是使中国人民和中国文艺工作者们感到十分兴奋的。
    中国人民和苏联人民之间的无比巩固的友好合作关系日益发展，中苏两国的文化交流近年来也更趋频繁密切，并由此而增进着两个伟大国家的人民之间的相互了解和兄弟般的友谊。中国文艺工作者一贯重视学习苏联的最先进艺术。“小白桦树”舞蹈团的到来，对我国艺术工作者来说，正是一个学习的好机会。
