    Confident in Running the Newly Established Agricultural Production Cooperative

    After studying the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's instructions on the issue of agricultural cooperativization conveyed by the county party committee, I examined my own right-leaning thoughts in leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    When my township established cooperatives last year, my understanding of class policy was very vague. I blindly pursued numbers. For example, in the first electoral district where I lived, there were forty-nine households, and I organized thirty-eight of them at once. Apart from landlords and rich peasants, small land renters and prosperous middle peasants were also pulled into the cooperative. After a month or so, those prosperous middle peasants began to waver. At that time, I didn't know to analyze it from a class perspective, and simply said that the cooperative members' awareness was too low and the cooperative couldn't be run successfully. Therefore, I mobilized eighteen households that I thought were not active enough to withdraw from the cooperative. Some of the poor peasants firmly requested to stay in the cooperative, but I refused their requests, instead thinking that they were spontaneous forces who wanted to get loans, etc. However, no matter how I mobilized them, they were unwilling to withdraw from the cooperative. I had no choice but to go to the district committee for a solution. The district committee suggested that I set up another branch cooperative. Although I helped these poor peasants establish a branch cooperative at the time, I didn't actually plan to lead and consolidate the branch cooperative, thinking that there were no backbones inside and it would collapse sooner or later. Who knew that the branch cooperative not only didn't collapse, but also greatly increased production and was consolidated. This fact fully demonstrates that my understanding has fallen far behind the new situation, and instead of leading the peasants well, I have dampened the peasants' enthusiasm for taking the socialist road.

    Previously, the higher authorities assigned my township to establish four new cooperatives. At that time, I thought that the township had already established seven cooperatives, and there was no mass base for establishing more cooperatives. Through this study, I analyzed the actual situation of the entire township from a class perspective, and saw that the facts were not as I had imagined. Of the three hundred and thirty-six households in the township, excluding landlords, rich peasants, and other households, one hundred and thirty-two of the remaining three hundred and ten households had not yet joined the cooperative; and currently, eighty-four poor and lower-middle peasants are eager to join the cooperative, accounting for sixty-three percent of the total number of households that have not joined. For example, four poor peasant households in the seventh electoral district who moved to the second electoral district during the land reform all moved back because the second electoral district had not yet established a cooperative and they wanted to join the cooperative in the seventh electoral district. Another example is Zhang Yonggen, a poor peasant in the seventh electoral district who did not join the cooperative last year. This year, he constantly asked whether the cooperative would be established, and in order to strive to join the cooperative, he weeded the fields extra clean this year. Cheng Dala, a solo farmer in the sixth electoral district, always runs to participate whenever he sees the Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative holding a meeting for cooperative members. The members of Ni Kaiyan's mutual aid group in the fifth electoral district were overjoyed when they heard that the higher authorities had approved their group to become a cooperative this year, and they had already discussed the candidate for the cooperative director. These vivid facts show that the enthusiasm of the peasant masses for taking the socialist road is very high. In the past, because I was not good at analyzing problems from a class perspective, I could not see the high tide of the rural cooperative movement was about to arrive.

    In the past, I always said that there were no backbones for running the cooperative, the branch couldn't lead it, and it was easy to establish the cooperative but difficult to consolidate it. Now, I have recalled it well. When my township established seven cooperatives at once last year, we indeed had no experience at all; now, these seven cooperatives have all been consolidated and production has increased. At the same time, the branch has gained some experience in running cooperatives over the past year. As for backbones, didn't I say earlier that there were no backbones in that branch cooperative I mentioned above? Now this cooperative is running very well, which shows that the power of the masses is great and the wisdom of the masses is infinite. In addition, with the correct leadership of the higher party committee, and the promotion of the state's first five-year plan and the "three fix" policy, the four new cooperatives in my township can be completely run well.

### 有信心办好新建的农业生产合作社

    有信心办好新建的农业生产合作社编辑同志：
    学习县委传达的中共中央关于农业合作化问题的指示以后，我检查了自己在领导互助合作运动中的右倾思想。
    去年我乡办社时，我对阶级政策的认识很模糊，盲目追求数字，如我住的第一选区共有四十九户，一下子就组织起来了三十八户；除地主富农外，小土地出租者和富裕中农也都拉进了社里。搞了个把月，那些富裕中农就开始动摇了。当时我不知道用阶级观点去进行分析，只是说社员觉悟太低，办不成社，因此就动员了我认为似乎不够积极的十八户出社。其中有一部分贫农坚决要求留在社里，我却拒绝了他们的要求，反而认为他们是自发势力，想得贷款等等。可是不管怎样动员，他们还是不愿出社，我没办法，只好去找区委解决。区委的意见是叫我再办一个分社。当时我虽然帮助这一部分贫农建立了一个分社，但是实际上没有打算把分社领导起来、巩固下去，认为里面没有骨干，迟早会垮台的。谁知分社不独没有垮台，而且大大地增产了，巩固了。这个事实，充分说明了我的认识已经远远落在新的形势后面，不独不去很好地领导农民，反而还挫伤了农民走社会主义道路的积极性。
    前次，上级分配我乡新建四个社，当时我认为乡里已经办了七个社，要再办社已没有群众基础。通过这次学习，我用阶级观点把全乡的实际情况分析了一下，看清了事实并不像我想像的那样。全乡三百三十六户，除了地主、富农等户以外，其余三百一十户中有一百三十二户还没有入社；而当前迫切要求入社的贫农、下中农就有八十四户，占未入社户总数的百分之六十三。如第七选区在土地改革中搬到第二选区去住的四户贫农，因为第二选区还没有办社，他们想参加第七选区这个社，就都搬回来了。又如第七选区贫农张永根去年没有入社，今年不断询问合作社还办不办，他为了争取入社，今年田里的草扯得格外干净。第六选区单干农民程大腊，每看到战胜农业生产合作社开社员会，他总跑去参加。第五选区倪开燕互助组的组员们，听说上级批准他们组今年转社，都喜得不得了，并且已经酝酿好了社长人选。这些生动的事实说明，农民群众走社会主义道路的热情是很高的，以前由于我不善于运用阶级观点去分析问题，所以就看不到农村合作化运动的高潮即将到来。
    以前我总说办社没有骨干，支部领导不了，建社容易巩固难。现在我很好地回忆了一下，我乡去年一回建起七个社，当时确实一点经验没有；现在这七个社都巩固了，增了产。同时，一年来支部已经取得了一定的办社经验。再就骨干来说吧，上面提到的那个分社，我先前不也是说他们没有骨干吗？现在这个社却办得很好，这说明群众的力量是伟大的，群众的智慧是无穷的。再加上有上级党委的正确领导，有国家第一个五年计划和“三定”政策的推动，我乡新建的四个社是完全可以办好的。
