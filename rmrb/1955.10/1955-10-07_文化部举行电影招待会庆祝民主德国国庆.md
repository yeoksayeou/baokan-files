Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China held a film reception at the Capital Cinema on the evening of the 6th to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.

    A feature film from the German Democratic Republic, "Overcoming the Night," was screened at the reception.

    "Overcoming the Night" is a film depicting the struggle of German workers against fascist rule in the 1930s. It describes how Hans, a leader of the German Communist Party, and his comrades led the people in a heroic and resolute struggle against Hitler and against the war under the dark rule of fascism. In the end, although he gloriously sacrificed himself in a fascist concentration camp, his cause finally achieved victory: the invincible Soviet Red Army defeated the Hitlerite invaders, and Hans and his comrades' great ideal—a socialist new Germany—was finally realized in eastern Germany.

    Those attending the reception included Chen Kehan, Vice Minister of Culture, Chen Zhongjing, Acting Director of the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations, and other responsible persons from relevant departments, responsible persons from various people's organizations, and film workers from the capital, totaling more than 1,200 people.

    Grutner, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China, First Secretary Deikes, and other members of the embassy also attended the reception.

    文化部举行电影招待会庆祝民主德国国庆
    新华社六日讯中华人民共和国文化部为庆祝德意志民主共和国成立六周年，六日晚在首都影院举行电影招待会。
    招待会上放映了一部德意志民主共和国故事影片“战胜黑夜”。
    “战胜黑夜”是一部表现德国工人在二十世纪三十年代为反对法西斯统治而斗争的影片。它描写了一个德国共产党的领导人汉斯和他的战友在法西斯的黑暗统治下，如何领导人民进行英勇坚决的反对希特勒、反对战争的斗争。最后，他虽然光荣牺牲在法西斯的集中营里，但他的事业终于得到了胜利：无敌的苏联红军击溃了希特勒侵略军，汉斯和他的同志们伟大的理想——社会主义的新德国终于在德国东部实现了。
    出席招待会的有文化部副部长陈克寒，对外文化联络局代理局长陈忠经和其他有关各部门负责人，各人民团体负责人和首都的电影工作者等共一千二百多人。
    德意志民主共和国驻华大使馆临时代办葛鲁特纳、一等秘书戴克斯及使馆其他人员也出席了招待会。
