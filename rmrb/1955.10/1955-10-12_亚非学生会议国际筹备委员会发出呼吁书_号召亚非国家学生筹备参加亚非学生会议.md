The appeal stated that, according to the initiators' views, the main objectives of the Asian-African Student Conference should be: to discuss common problems and common interests in order to promote cooperation in culture, sports, learning, and student welfare; to promote mutual understanding and recognition among students of various countries and to strengthen friendly relations among them; and to discuss the contributions that students can make to promote peace and ease tensions.

The appeal stated that the historically significant results achieved at the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung this year have become a beacon on our path. In today's world, a new Asia and Africa are radiating brilliant light, and hundreds of millions of people are filled with the spirit of mutual cooperation and friendship. The people have great hopes for students and youth, expecting them to put this noble ideal into practice.

The appeal calls on students from Asian and African countries to immediately begin preparations to ensure that representatives from their countries will participate in the Asian-African Student Conference; and calls on all students from Asian and African countries to participate in discussions on the purpose of the Asian-African Student Conference and to make suggestions so that the first Asian-African Student Conference will become a historical milestone in student cooperation and friendship.

The International Preparatory Committee also announced that it would invite more than 300 student groups from 45 countries in Asia and Africa to send representatives to the Asian-African Student Conference.
