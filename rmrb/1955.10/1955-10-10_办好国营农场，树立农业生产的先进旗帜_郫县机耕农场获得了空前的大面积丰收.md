    Run State-Owned Farms Well, Establish Advanced Banners of Agricultural Production
    Pixian Mechanized Farm Achieved an Unprecedented Large-Scale Bumper Harvest
    To the Editor:
    Recently, I visited the state-owned Pixian Mechanized Farm on the West Sichuan Plain. This farm achieved an unprecedented large-scale bumper harvest this year. According to preliminary estimates, the average yield of rice paddies across the farm's 1,720 mu was 620 jin of grain per mu, an increase of 18.9 percent compared to 1954, exceeding this year's production increase plan by 3.58 percent.

    The bumper harvest is the result of the hard work of the employees. Under the call for increasing production and practicing economy, all the workers in the farm launched an enthusiastic labor emulation campaign. In the spring, tractors marched to the fields before dawn; sometimes they worked until late at night, and from late at night until dawn. Zou Hongguang, a member of the Communist Youth League and a tractor driver, along with his five young assistants, created a new record of plowing 152 mu of land with eight plows in ten hours, enabling the farm to plant all its land on time and saving fuel. During the autumn harvest, the group led by Zhang Guomin, a member of the Communist Youth League, threshed 587 jin of grain per workday, exceeding the quota by more than 60 percent. From spring plowing to autumn harvest, the entire farm saved 3,260 workdays compared to the plan. In addition, by paying attention to reducing spillage and collecting fallen grains during the autumn harvest, the farm harvested more than 2,500 jin of grain for the state.

    The farm's success in achieving a bumper harvest is also due to the application of science and technology in combination with local conditions. For example, in mid-April, the local climate suddenly turned cold, and rainfall increased, leading to widespread seedling rot outside the farm; due to the farm's implementation of "level fields, shallow water, timely irrigation and drainage" measures, and the timely application of plant ash and dried pig manure in the autumn fields, in addition to ensuring the seedlings needed by the farm, they also provided autumn seedlings that could plant more than 200 mu of land and more than 7,600 jin of grain seeds to support nearby agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams. The farm used scientific methods to measure the peak period of rice borers, and sprayed 666 pesticide powder in a timely manner, effectively preventing insect pests. The farm also determined the rice planting density and the number of autumn seedlings based on soil, grain varieties, and planting season, achieving good results. In addition, the farm has made progress in the experiments on "Maltsev tillage method" and direct dry seeding of rice paddies using mechanized farming.

    This year, the farm also made full use of various agricultural by-products to develop sideline occupations such as animal husbandry, tile kilns, and mills; these sideline occupations in turn strongly supported agriculture. The fertilizer used in the farm this year mainly came from the manure produced by more than 600 pigs, 33 dairy cows, and draft cattle, the plant ash burned by the tile kiln, and other self-made fertilizers, with very little commercial fertilizer purchased. In this way, fertilization for rice alone saved more than 8,000 yuan compared to last year.

    Pixian Mechanized Farm has become a model for the broad masses of farmers in the West Sichuan Plain to learn from. Since this year, the farm has received more than 11,000 visitors from various counties, including ethnic minority brothers from the Kangzang Plateau. Every visitor went back with full hope and confidence in agricultural mechanization. The farmers near the farm take pride and honor in the phrase "learn from the farm."

    办好国营农场，树立农业生产的先进旗帜
    郫县机耕农场获得了空前的大面积丰收编辑同志：
    最近我访问了川西平原上的国营郫县机耕农场。这个农场今年获得了空前的大面积丰收。据初步估计，全场一千七百二十市亩水田平均每亩收了六百二十斤谷子，比一九五四年增产百分之十八点九，超额完成今年的增产计划百分之三点五八。
    丰收，是职工的辛勤劳动换来的。在增产节约的号召下，场内全体工人展开了热烈的劳动竞赛。春天，拖拉机在黎明未到以前就向田野进军；有时一直干到深夜，又从深夜工作到天明。拖拉机手青年团员邹宏光和他的五个青年助手，创造了拖八个铧十小时耕一百五十二亩地的新纪录，使农场的全部土地能够按时栽种，又节省了油料。秋收时，青年团员张国民领导的小组以每个工作日挞谷五百八十七斤的成绩，突破定额百分之六十以上。从春耕到秋收，全场比计划节省了三千二百六十个工。另外，由于在秋收中注意减少抛撒和拣拾谷吊，就为国家多收了二千五百多斤谷子。
    这个农场之所以得到丰收，还因为结合当地情况运用了科学技术。如四月中旬，当地气候骤冷，雨水增多，场外普遍发生烂秧现象；由于农场施行了“田平水浅、灌排适时”的办法，又及时在秋田中撒了草木灰和干猪粪，因此除了保证场内需要的秋苗以外，还拿出可栽两百多亩田的秋苗和七千六百多斤谷种来支援附近的农业生产合作社和互助组。农场用科学方法测出了螟虫的盛发期，适时喷撒了六六六药粉，有力地防止了虫害。农场又根据土壤、谷种和栽秧时期等情况，分别决定水稻密植距离和秋苗产数，取得了良好的效果。另外，场内对“马尔采夫耕作法”和水田机耕旱直播的试验，也有了成绩。
    今年场内还充分利用各种农业副产品来发展畜牧、瓦窑、碾坊等副业；这些副业又有力地支援了农业。今年农场里所用的肥料，主要是六百多只猪、三十三条奶牛和耕牛所产的粪肥，瓦窑场所烧的草木灰，以及其它自制肥料，很少买商品肥料。这样，仅水稻施肥就比去年节约了八千多元。
    郫县机耕农场已经成为川西平原广大农民学习的榜样。今年以来，农场已经接待了一万一千多位来自各县的客人，其中有来自康藏高原的少数民族兄弟。每一个参观者都带着对农业机械化的满怀希望和信心回去。农场附近的农民都把“照着农场学习”这句话引为骄傲和光荣。　                                    　　刘冰
