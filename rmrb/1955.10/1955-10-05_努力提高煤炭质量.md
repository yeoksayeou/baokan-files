Strive to Improve Coal Quality
Yang Fumian
Coal is one of the essential power sources for industry and transportation. Over the past few years, with the development of the national economic construction, the demand for coal has increased significantly. Although coal production has basically ensured the needs of national industry, transportation, and market supply, the problem of poor coal quality has not been well resolved. In the first half of this year, the average ash content of raw coal reached more than 20%, 1.77% higher than the original plan and 0.5% higher than the average ash content in 1954. The increase in coal ash content in the first half of the year is equivalent to 565,000 tons of raw coal.

The poor quality of coal is mainly manifested in the following two aspects:

	One is that the ash content and gangue content of coal have increased compared to the past. For example, the ash content of washed raw coal at the Pingxiang Mining Bureau was actually 18.67% in 1954, while this year the bureau's plan is set at 24.8%, an increase of 6.13% compared to the actual in 1954, and 6.8% higher than the national standard (referring to the ash content stipulated by the national allocation price). The ash content of mixed coal at the Xin Zhuangzi Mine of the Huainan Mining Bureau was actually 18.82% in 1954, while this year the bureau's plan is 20.9%, 3.9% higher than the national standard. The ash content of No. 4 raw coal at Zixing Mine actually reached 40% in April, and the ash content of low-quality coal at Fangzi Coal Mine reached 47.3%, exceeding the national standard by 13.03%. Some tons of coal can burn less than half a ton. From the above situation, it can be seen that the ash content and gangue content of coal in various mines are generally increasing.

	The other is that there are many impurities in the coal. For example, in the mines of the Huainan Mining Bureau, there are many pit props in the coal. In the Xin Zhuangzi Mine of this bureau, there is one cubic meter of pit props for every 4,000 tons of coal shipped to users. The Nanjing Coal Construction Company picked out a large number of pit props from the coal, some of which were as long as one or two meters. Some units also reported that they had picked up a large number of equipment such as electric chain conveyors, coal car wheels, coal cutting machine teeth, pneumatic picks, explosives, and detonators from the coal produced by the Zibo Bureau. At the Dakunlun coal loading station of Zibo Mine, we saw various equipment picked out from the coal, which could fill an area of eight or nine square meters. According to incomplete statistics, from November last year to June this year, there were 29 incidents of finding explosives in coal, and 50 detonators and 5 packs of explosives were found.

The poor quality of coal not only seriously affects the credibility of state-owned enterprises and causes waste of national transportation capacity, but also seriously affects industrial production, causing great losses to the national economic construction. For example, the Nanjing Power Plant often encounters problems such as small pit props mixed in the coal, which affects the injection of pulverized coal into the furnace and blocks the sieve holes of the crusher, resulting in frequent accidents. Due to excessive ash and gangue content, and insufficient calorific value of the coal itself, train locomotives often have to stop. In shipping, the excessive amount of stone in coal increases coal consumption, reduces transportation capacity, and lowers transportation efficiency. In the first quarter, the Shanghai Maritime Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation needed to increase coal consumption by 30% according to the original planned demand. The Ministry of Railways needs to increase coal by 99,000 tons this year according to the current situation. In short, the poor quality of coal not only increases industrial production costs but also causes a series of adverse consequences for the work of various production departments. The incomplete removal of explosives in coal poses a serious danger to people's lives and property and to national construction. Therefore, all mines must pay close attention to improving the quality of coal.

The reasons for the poor quality of coal are mainly that leading staff at all levels lack a comprehensive view of completing the plan and do not pay attention to the quality of coal. In 1953, there was a nationwide shortage of coal supply. Therefore, various mines believed that "as long as there is coal, there is no need to worry about sales," fostering the erroneous business idea of "emphasizing quantity over quality." Some mines have long placed the issue of coal quality in a dispensable position, and some even mistakenly pitted output against quality. They felt that there would be penalties for security work problems, criticisms for low production efficiency and failure to complete financial plans, but no consequences for failing to complete coal quality tasks, so they relaxed their attention to coal quality. This is not right. The lack of a strict product acceptance system and the lax technical management of the coal preparation department are also one of the reasons for the poor quality of coal. In many coal mines, production management is chaotic, and the acceptance system for raw coal at the mine mouth has not been seriously implemented. Many mines do not even have regular sieves to check gangue content. Some mines, in order to reduce loading and unloading costs, directly load and transport raw coal without screening it. The coal type management of many mines is also chaotic. In some mines, the coal preparation work is done by elderly and weak women or even workers with poor eyesight. It is difficult to ensure the quality of coal in this way.

The coal quality inspection and testing institutions in many coal mines are also unsound. The coal preparation section of Pingxiang Mine does not have a full-time cadre in charge, but is concurrently managed by the trade union staff; the original coal quality testing rooms at various pit entrances of Zixing Mine have been abolished this year; the testing work in some mines has even become laissez-faire, and it is not clear how much gangue is selected every day. In this way, the coal quality inspection and testing work cannot play a supervisory role on coal quality. Many coal mines have not given enough consideration to how to improve coal quality from the mining method. The No. 7 seam of Xin Zhuangzi Mine in Huainan is six meters thick, containing three layers of gangue with a thickness of 0.2 to 0.5 meters in the middle. Simply to increase output and facilitate mining, they did not mine according to natural layers (separate mining of coal and stone) but according to artificial layers. In this way, the gangue was mined as coal, thereby increasing the ash content of the coal and greatly reducing the quality of the coal. In addition, since the mines generally calculate output and pay wages based on "footage volume," the gangue layer of the coal mining face is counted as output, causing coal miners to pay no attention to picking gangue underground, resulting in a decline in coal quality.

Another reason is that the coal quality plan targets are conservative. The preliminary draft of the 1955 coal product catalogue formulated by the former Ministry of Fuel Industry had relatively conservative ash content indicators, which affected the plan targets of various mines to be conservatively set. The average ash content stipulated in the product catalogue of Xin Zhuangzi Coal Mine in Huainan was 20.9% (the ash content target set by this bureau is the same), which exceeded the national standard by 3.9%, while the actual ash content from January to April still exceeded the national standard by 3.8%, but it still overfulfilled the regulations of the product catalogue and the bureau's plan target (that is, reduced the ash content by 0.09%). The actual gangue content of Xin Zhuangzi Mine from January to April was 1.29%, while the product catalogue stipulated 2% to 2.5%. With such a conservative plan, various mines can overfulfill it effortlessly, making it impossible to improve coal quality.

The lack of clear regulations on coal production indicators in the national plan also affects the quality of coal. At present, it is calculated based on the production of raw coal, and there is no regulation on gangue content. As a result, the amount of stone reported to the state as scrap within the plan by the Fuxin, Jiaozuo, and Pingxiang mines alone reached 270,000 tons in the first half of the year, and it was "legal." From the form, they completed or even overfulfilled the national plan and could also receive national bonuses and excess profits, but in essence, this is a serious waste and loss of national wealth.

In order to ensure the comprehensive completion of the 1955 production plan, all coal mines must reverse the practice of neglecting quality. To this end, the following tasks should be done well:

	1. It should be fully recognized that improving coal quality is not only a technical issue but also a fierce and long-term ideological struggle. The thinking and practice of only pursuing quantity and ignoring quality and pitting quality against output fundamentally violates the principles of socialist enterprise management, while completing quality indicators and continuously improving coal quality are the basic requirements for comprehensively completing the national plan. Therefore, the leading staff of various bureaus and mines should give importance to improving coal quality and earnestly implement the relevant instructions from higher authorities on improving coal quality and strengthening coal preparation work, and reverse the erroneous business thinking of "emphasizing quantity over quality."

	2. Improve the coal preparation organization, strengthen the leadership of quality inspection and testing departments, and enable them to actively play a supervisory and inspection role on coal quality to ensure the continuous improvement of coal quality. The coal preparation sections of various mines that do not have full-time cadres should be equipped with full-time cadres; departments without screening equipment should also add some necessary screening equipment. In addition, existing coal preparation equipment should be fully utilized and improved, and manual selection work should be strengthened. In coal preparation plants, the advanced experience of colored gangue picking using red light bulb lighting in the Soviet Union can also be promoted. The discipline inspection committees of various mines should also regularly inspect and supervise the management and use of coal quality and explosives. Penalties should be given for violations of the system that cause losses, and rewards should be given for achievements in improving coal quality.

	3. Conduct extensive and in-depth quality education for employees, mobilize the masses to participate in the supervision of coal quality, so that all employees can understand the harm of poor coal quality to national economic construction and people's lives, thereby raising awareness and improving coal quality and mining methods.

	4. For mines that increase ash content and gangue content in violation of national standards, the reward and penalty clauses of the supply and purchase contract should be earnestly implemented, or the difference for the excess part should be compensated to achieve the purpose of reducing ash content and reducing gangue content.

    努力提高煤炭质量
    杨甫绵
    煤炭是工业和交通运输业的重要动力之一。几年来，随着国家经济建设事业的发展，对煤炭的需要量有了显著的增加。虽然煤炭的生产量基本上保证了国家工业、交通运输业和市场供应的需要，但是煤炭质量低劣的问题一直没有得到很好的解决。今年上半年原煤灰分平均达到百分之二十多，比原计划提高百分之一点七七，比一九五四年平均灰分提高百分之零点五。上半年煤炭灰分的增加，相当于五十六万五千吨原煤。
    煤炭质量的低劣主要表现在以下两方面：
      一个是煤炭灰分和含矸率较前增多。如萍乡矿务局洗原煤的灰分，一九五四年实际是百分之十八点六七，而今年这个局计划订为百分之二十四点八，比一九五四年实际增高百分之六点一三，比今年国家指标（指国家调拨价格规定所含灰分）增加百分之六点八。淮南矿务局新庄孜矿的混煤灰分，一九五四年实际是百分之一八点八二，而本年度这个局计划则为百分之二十点九。比今年国家指标增高百分之三点九。资兴矿四号原煤的灰分，四月份实际已达百分之四十，坊子煤矿的低质煤灰分达百分之四十七点三，超过国家指标百分之十三点零三。有的一吨煤，能燃用的还不到半吨。从以上情况可以看出各矿煤炭的灰分和含矸率是在普遍提高。
    另一个是煤炭中的混杂物多。例如，淮南矿务局各矿，煤炭中就含有很多坑木。这个矿新庄孜矿每运往用户四千吨煤中，就有一立方公尺的坑木。南京煤建公司在煤中拣出了大量坑木，有的竟长达一、二公尺。也有几个单位反映，他们在淄博局生产的煤里，曾拣到电溜子的链条，煤车轮子、截煤机牙、风镐、炸药、雷管等大量器材。我们在淄博矿大昆仑装煤站，看到了从煤里拣出来的各种器材，可以摆满一个八、九平方公尺的地面。据不完全的统计，从去年十一月至今年六月，在煤炭中发现爆炸物的事件，就有二十九次，发现雷管五十只和炸药五包。
    煤炭质量的低劣不仅严重影响到国营企业的信誉，造成国家运输力的浪费，而且也使工业生产受到严重的影响，给国家经济建设事业造成很大的损失。例如南京电厂，他们常常因为煤炭中夹杂有碎小的坑木，而影响了煤粉喷入炉膛和堵塞破碎机的筛孔等操作，致使事故不断发生。由于灰分和矸石含量过多而本身不能燃烧，煤的发热量不足，经常造成火车机车的停车事故。在航运上，也因煤炭中石头过多，用煤量增加，使运量减少，运输效率降低。交通部上海海运局第一季度按原计划需要量即需增加百分之三十的耗煤量。铁道部按目前情况今年需增加煤炭九万九千吨。总之，由于煤质的低劣，不仅增加了工业生产成本，并且给各生产部门的工作造成了一系列的恶果。煤中爆炸物没有彻底清除，对人民生命财产、对国家建设也有严重的危险。因此，各矿必须十分注意提高煤炭的质量。
    造成煤炭质量低劣的原因，主要是各级领导工作人员缺乏全面完成计划的观点，不重视煤炭质量。一九五三年，全国曾发生煤炭供不应求的现象。因而各矿就认为“只要有煤，不愁没有销路”，滋长了“重量不重质”的错误经营思想。有的矿竟长期把煤的质量问题放在可有可无的位置上，有的甚至错误地把产量和质量对立起来。他们觉得保安工作有问题要受处分，生产效率低、财务计划完不成要受批评，煤质完不成任务则没有什么关系，因而放松了对煤炭质量的注意。这是不应该的。缺乏严格的产品验收制度和选煤部门技术管理工作松懈，也是造成煤质低劣的原因之一。在许多煤矿的矿井上，生产管理很乱，井口毛煤的验收制度都没有认真执行。很多矿连检查含矸的正规筛子都没有。有些矿为了降低装卸费用，竟把原煤不加拣选即直接装车运送出去，许多矿的煤种管理也很乱。有的矿的选煤工作竟让老弱的妇女甚至是视力很差的工人去做。这样是很难保证煤的质量的。
    许多煤矿的煤质检查化验机构也不健全。萍乡矿选煤科没有专职干部负责，而是由工会工作人员兼管；资兴矿各坑口原有煤质化验室今年已撤销；有的矿的化验工作竟形成自流，每天选出多少矸石都弄不清。这样，煤质的检查化验工作就不能对煤质起到监督的作用。许多煤矿对如何从开采方法上来提高煤质也考虑得不够。淮南新庄孜矿的七槽煤，共六公尺厚，中间含有零点二至零点五公尺的夹矸石三层。单单为了提高产量和开采的方便，他们就没有按自然分层（煤、石分采）开采，而按人工分层开采。这样，就把夹矸石当煤采了，因而提高了煤的灰分，大大降低了煤的质量。此外，由于各矿一般都是按“进尺量方”来计算产量和发工资，这样就把采煤工作面的夹矸层都算作了产量，致使采煤工人在井下不去注意拣矸子石，造成煤质下降。
    另外一个原因是煤质计划指标保守。前燃料工业部初步制定的一九五五年煤炭产品目录草案的灰分指标比较保守，以致影响各矿的计划指标也订得保守。淮南新庄孜煤矿产品目录规定的平均灰分为百分之二十点九（这个局订的灰分指标与此同），比国家指标超出了百分之三点九，而一至四月份实际仍超过国家指标百分之三点八，但还超额完成了产品目录的规定和局的计划指标（即降低了灰分百分之零点零九）。新庄孜矿含矸率一至四月份实际为百分之一点二九，而产品目录却规定了百分之二至二点五，像这样的保守计划，各矿不费力就可以超额完成，而使煤质不能提高。
    国家计划对煤炭生产指标规定得不够明确，也影响了煤的质量。目前，按生产毛煤计算，而对含矸率没有加以规定，因此仅阜新、焦作、萍乡三矿上半年在计划内向国家报废的石头即达二十七万吨，并且是“合法”的。从形式上看，他们完成了甚至超额完成了国家计划，还可以得到国家奖金和超额利润，而实质上这对国家财富是个严重的浪费和损失。
    为了保证全面地完成一九五五年生产计划，各煤矿必须扭转不重视质量的做法，为此应努力做好下面的一些工作：
    一、应充分认识提高产煤质量不单是技术问题，而是一场激烈的长期的思想斗争。那种只求数量不问质量和把质量同产量对立起来的思想和做法，是根本违犯社会主义企业经营原则的，而完成质量指标，不断提高产煤质量，乃是全面完成国家计划的基本要求。因此，各局矿的领导工作人员，应将提高煤质工作提到重要地位，切实贯彻上级关于提高煤质，加强选煤工作的有关指示，扭转“重量不重质”的错误经营思想。
    二、健全选煤机构，加强质量检查部门和化验部门的领导，使其积极发挥对煤质的监督、检查作用，以保证煤质的不断提高。各矿场的选煤科没有专职干部的应配备专职干部；没有筛选设备的部门，也应增加一些必须的筛选设备，此外，应充分利用和改善现有的选煤设备，加强手选工作。在选煤厂还可推广苏联的利用红色灯泡照明的有色拣矸的先进经验。各矿的纪律检查委员会也应经常检查监督煤质和爆炸物的管理使用情况，对不遵守制度而造成损失的应给予处分，对提高煤质有成绩的应加以奖励。
    三、广泛深入地向职工群众进行质量教育，发动群众参加对煤质的监督，使全体职工认识煤质低劣对国家经济建设和人民生活的危害，从而提高认识，改进煤质和采煤方法。
    四、对不按国家规定指标而提高灰分，增加含矸的矿场，应认真执行供购合同的奖罚条款或补给超过部分的差额，以达到降低灰分减少含矸的目的。
