    We Must Firmly Grasp Two Basic Links
    Wu Nansheng
    The “Three Fixes” (fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales) to the household for grain is a complex economic and political task, which is related to the vital interests of millions of farm households. To reasonably allocate fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales figures to households, based on the experience of Gaoyao County, Guangdong Province, in implementing the "Three Fixes" to the household, we must grasp two links from beginning to end: First, promote democracy and fully mobilize the masses; second, implement policies. The "Three Fixes" work in Gaoyao County is roughly divided into four steps, and these two basic links were tightly grasped in each working step.
    I
    At the beginning of the "Three Fixes" work, in addition to clarifying the thinking of party members and staff, the most important thing is to hold the township people's congress meeting well under the leadership of the party branch; to elect a "Three Fixes" evaluation committee at the people's congress meeting, and to conduct investigation and research, analyze materials, and formulate distribution plans after the representative meeting.
    After explaining the significance and practices of the "Three Fixes" policy, most people's representatives expressed their support for the "Three Fixes" policy; however, some people did not have a sufficient understanding of the benefits of unified grain purchase and sales, and were skeptical about whether the "Three Fixes" policy could be correctly implemented. At this time, we must fully promote democracy by using methods such as recalling, comparing, and accounting, to inspire the representatives to understand the benefits of unified grain purchase and sales from their own experiences, and to criticize the shortcomings of the unified grain purchase and sales work.
    In this regard, Gaoyao County once had two different approaches: one was to let go and promote democracy, allowing representatives to criticize the shortcomings of past grain purchase and sales work, and then analyze the situation and distinguish right from wrong. In townships that did this, the meetings were well held, and the representatives' thinking was improved. The other approach was to be afraid of letting go and promoting democracy, and the meetings ended hastily. In townships that did this, they could neither find ways to overcome shortcomings in their work, nor could they clarify the thinking of core members. After the meeting, the masses had more doubts, and the work fell into a passive state.
    Through promoting democracy, the representatives at the meeting revealed all the good and bad situations in the township, and concentratedly reflected various opinions and requirements of the masses; by analyzing these situations, we could roughly see the reasons why grain purchase and sales were too tight or too loose. On this basis, we should guide the representatives to carefully calculate a few accounts. First, calculate the big picture. For example, Gaoyao County purchased 104.98 million catties of grain in 1954, but sold 106.89 million catties. This means that the state subsidized 1.91 million catties of grain. Was it because Gaoyao County was short of grain? No. In 1954, excluding public grain, the total grain produced in the county was averaged according to the county's population (including more than 100,000 urban residents and the non-agricultural population in rural areas), and each person could get 532 catties. This amount is not small. The reason why the state sold more grain was because the unified grain sales work had shortcomings, and there was waste in grain consumption. Therefore, it should be explained to the representatives that if all counties in the country were like Gaoyao County, the state would not be able to correctly implement the unified grain purchase and sales plan. After calculating the big picture, calculate the small accounts of a township. For example, how many people in this township were actually purchased "excess grain"? How many people purchased less surplus grain? How many people's supplies were insufficient? And how many people were oversupplied? How many people falsely claimed to be short of grain? After clarifying the truth, guide the representatives to analyze the reasons, criticize the shortcomings in their work, and point out the responsibilities of farmers in grain purchase and sales. In this way, the representatives' ideological understanding will be improved, they will have the confidence to mobilize the broad masses, and they will have an urgent need to do a good job in the "Three Fixes". Then, announce the preliminary grain purchase and sales quota indicators given to the township by the higher authorities. This will give the representatives a preliminary "bottom line" in their minds, which will make it easier for them to mobilize the masses when they go back.
    II
    In order to fully mobilize the masses, a certain amount of time must be set aside to carry out extensive publicity to the broad masses.
    The content and methods of this step are roughly the same as the ideological mobilization work in the previous step, except that the targets are different—from a few to a majority, from core members to all farmers.
    Many townships have neglected this step and are satisfied with the achievements of the People's Congress meeting. They do not understand that moving from mobilizing a few to mobilizing a majority is a more arduous mobilization process. After the representative meeting is over, they are busy announcing the "Three Fixes" targets to the farmers without organizing core members to seriously connect and mobilize the majority of farmers. In this way, many knots in the minds of farmers cannot be untied, and bad elements take the opportunity to provoke and sabotage, causing the work to take many detours. Some townships, after the People's Congress meeting, are busy with the statistics of production, purchase, and sales, and a few people close the door to engage in the "Three Fixes," treating the "Three Fixes" work as a purely technical task. This practice of being divorced from the masses will of course not have good results.
    A better approach is to use a combination of individual connections and group meetings (based on agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, absorbing nearby individual farmers to participate, or based on existing residential groups) to conduct ideological education; at appropriate times, mass meetings can be held. If there are still a few people who are not ideologically clear, small-scale forums can also be held, personally hosted by the district staff stationed in the township or the township party branch secretary and the township head, to solve their problems.
    Ideological mobilization work cannot be interrupted. Some staff members are unwilling to carry out individual connections, thinking that the method of individual connections is too slow and that the time will be too long. This is not right.
    This step must be carried out under the leadership of the party branch with the greatest effort; at the same time, a part of the people should be separated to lead the "Three Fixes" evaluation committee to conduct investigation and research, collect materials, and formulate plans, etc., in order to prepare for the next step of work.
    Attention should also be paid to doing a good job in ideological work for the evaluators. Facts have proved that farmers who are elected as evaluation committee members often have some ideological concerns. Therefore, education must be strengthened to dispel concerns. Whether the production, purchase, and sales of the evaluators' own families are reasonably fixed is of great significance to their work enthusiasm and their influence on the masses. Therefore, when formulating plans and initially calculating to households, their production, purchase, or sales numbers should be fairly and reasonably evaluated first, so that they can first settle down; if they can set an example themselves, they can gain the trust of the masses.
    III
    The third step is to determine the township's "Three Fixes" plan, and through democratic evaluation, rationally allocate the production, purchase, and sales figures to households. This is the most important step in implementing the "Three Fixes" policy.
    Before the figures are allocated to households, the party branch should analyze and estimate in advance the problems that may occur among the masses, and immediately launch publicity activities after the figures are allocated to households, in order to quickly gather the opinions of the masses and make necessary adjustments to the "Three Fixes" plan. At the beginning of the third step, it is necessary to convene another People's Congress meeting to discuss and determine the "Three Fixes" plan. It is best to brew and discuss the plan among the representatives before the People's Congress meeting to obtain roughly consistent opinions, and to start allocating the figures to households. In order to gain experience and avoid detours, a village can be used as a pilot first, and after gaining experience, it can be spread throughout the township.
    In determining the plan and allocating the figures to households, attention should also be paid to several issues:
    First, it is necessary to prevent the use of simple methods in the production determination process. For example, some townships use grain purchase task indicators to determine output; some townships do not distinguish between good and bad land and operating conditions, and determine a productivity for a township, averaging the distribution of numbers; some townships deliberately increase production in order to complete the task; some townships do not determine production according to normal yield, but simply according to the production plans ordered by the masses. The output determined by these methods is naturally not realistic, and the masses cannot accept it. When evaluating output, it is necessary to consider not only land quality and natural conditions, but also the operating conditions of farmers, because the output may also be vastly different when the same land has vastly different operating conditions.
    Second, we must resolutely implement the policy of "only purchasing surplus grain, not purchasing food grain." There should be no wavering on this point. Attention should be paid to preventing the tendency of adding tasks and adding circulating grain at all levels; for farmers who purchased too much or too little surplus grain last year, when adjusting their sales tasks this year, the masses should be fully educated first, and then adjustments should be made, so as to avoid mutual opinions among the masses.
    Third, purchase and sales work must be unified. It should be repeatedly explained to the farmers that this year, from the perspective of planned figures, there is less grain sold, but in reality, it is only reducing the wasted part in the past and correcting the unreasonable supply part, and it is by no means to cut reasonable supplies. At the same time, attention should also be paid to preventing the idea of emphasizing purchase and de-emphasizing sales and the erroneous practice of blindly lowering sales figures.
    When the third step of work is completed and preparing to turn to the fourth step, the "Three Fixes" work in the township can be temporarily stopped, so that the county and district leading organs have enough time to study and review the distribution of "Three Fixes" figures in the townships that are simultaneously spreading the "Three Fixes" work in the county and district, and to timely adjust the places that are too high or too low.
    IV
    The fourth step is to review and approve, announce the finalized plan, summarize the work, and fully turn to production.
    After the third step of work is completed and before the fourth step begins, the leading organs at all levels must seize the opportunity to organize forces to conduct a comprehensive, systematic, and in-depth inspection of the policy implementation in the previous stage of work. We must pay attention to how many households in a township are still dissatisfied with the "Three Fixes" figures, and understand what problems may be left behind after the "Three Fixes" are in place, so that they can be properly handled in the fourth step.
    Then, the township will convene another People's Congress meeting to finally review and approve the "Three Fixes" figures of each household in the township, announce the finalized plan to the masses, and summarize the "Three Fixes" work at the same time.
    We must make the representatives realize the correctness of the party and the state's policies through summarizing the work, realize the glorious tasks of the farmers in building socialism, and consciously criticize their past erroneous understandings. This is an extremely meaningful education about the worker-peasant alliance and socialism. The staff should also conduct criticism and self-criticism on the work style in the past and this work in order to achieve the purpose of correcting shortcomings and strengthening the relationship between the party and the masses.
    After the summary is completed, announce the end of the "Three Fixes" work, and call on the representatives to go back and lead the masses to fully turn to production and welcome the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement.

    必须紧紧地掌握两个基本环节
    吴南生
    粮食“三定”到户是一个复杂的经济工作和政治工作，它关系着千百万农户的切身利益。要想把定产、定购、定销数字合理分配到户，根据广东省高要县“三定”到户工作的经验，必须自始至终掌握两个环节：一是发扬民主，充分发动群众；一是贯彻执行政策。高要县的“三定”工作大体划分为四个步骤，在每一工作步骤的过程中都紧紧地掌握了这两个基本环节。
    一
    “三定”工作开始时，除了要打通党员和工作人员的思想外，最重要的是在党支部的领导下开好乡人民代表大会会议；在人民代表大会会议上选出“三定”评议委员会，在代表大会会议结束后进行调查研究、分析材料等工作，并拟订分配方案。
    讲清“三定”政策的意义和做法后，大多数人民代表表示拥护“三定”政策；但是也有些人由于对粮食统购统销的好处认识不够，对“三定”政策能否正确贯彻心存怀疑。这时必须用回忆、对比、算账等方法，充分发扬民主，启发代表们从切身体会中认识粮食统购统销的好处，批评粮食统购统销工作中的缺点。
    在这方面，高要县曾经有过两种不同的做法：一种是放手发扬民主，让代表们批评过去粮食购销工作中的缺点，然后再分析情况，分别是非。凡是这样做的乡，会就开得好，代表们的思想就能够提高。另一种做法是：害怕放手发扬民主，会议潦草收场。凡是这样做的乡，既不能找出克服工作中缺点的办法，也不能打通骨干分子的思想，会议完了，群众疑虑更多，工作陷于被动。
    经过发扬民主，到会的代表把全乡的好坏情况都摆出来了，把群众中的各种意见要求都集中地反映出来了；对这些情况加以分析，就可以大体看出粮食购销偏紧或偏松的原因。在这个基础上，要引导代表们好好算几笔账。先算大账，例如，高要县一九五四年购粮一亿零四百九十八万斤，却销售了一亿零六百八十九万斤，这就是说，国家倒贴了一百九十一万斤粮食。是不是因为高要县缺粮呢？不是的。一九五四年除去公粮外，全县所产粮食按全县人口（包括十万以上的城镇居民和农村中的非农业人口）平均，每人可得五百三十二斤，这个数目是不算少的。其所以多销售了国家的粮食，是因为粮食统销工作有缺点，粮食消费中有浪费。因此应当向代表们说明，如果全国各县都像高要县这样，国家就无法正确地执行粮食统购统销计划。算了大账再算一个乡的小账。例如，本乡内究竟有多少人确实被购了“过头粮”？有多少人少购了余粮？有多少人供应不足？又有多少人多供应了？有多少人假叫缺粮？弄清了真相以后，再引导代表们分析原因，批判工作中的缺点，指出农民在粮食统购统销方面的责任。这样，代表们的思想认识就提高了，有信心去发动广大群众，也有了搞好“三定”工作的迫切要求。然后公布上级初步规定给本乡的购粮和销粮数字指标。使代表们心里有初步的“底”，便于回去发动群众。
    二
    为了充分发动群众，必须划出一定时间专门向广大群众进行大张旗鼓的宣传。
    这一步工作的内容和方法，同前一工作步骤中的思想发动工作大体上是一样的，只是对象不同——从少数到多数，从骨干分子到全体农民。
    不少乡忽视了这一步工作，满足于人民代表大会会议的成就，他们不懂得从发动少数到发动多数是一个更艰苦的发动过程。在代表大会会议开完以后，就忙于向农民群众宣布“三定”指标，而不组织骨干分子认真去串连发动多数农民。这样，农民思想上的许多疙瘩就不能解开，坏分子也乘机挑拨破坏，使工作走了许多弯路。有些乡在人民代表大会会议开完之后，就忙于产、购、销的统计工作，少数人关着大门搞“三定”，把“三定”工作当作是一个单纯的技术工作来做。这种脱离群众的做法当然不会有好结果。
    比较好的做法是：运用个别串连和小组（以农业生产合作社、互助组为基础吸收附近的单干农民参加，或以原有的居民小组为单位）会议相结合的方式，进行思想教育；在适当时机，可以召开群众大会。如果还有少数人思想不通，也可以召开小型座谈会，由驻乡的区工作人员或乡支部书记、乡长亲自主持，解决他们的问题。
    思想发动工作不能中断。有些工作人员不愿意进行个别串连，认为个别串连的方法太慢，恐怕时间会拖得太长，这是不对的。
    这一步工作必须在党支部领导下，用最大的力量去进行；同时要分出一部分人领导“三定”评议委员会进行调查研究、汇集材料、制定方案等工作，以便为下一步工作做准备。
    对评议员也要注意做好思想工作。事实证明，当选为评议委员的农民，往往也有一些思想顾虑。因此必须加强教育，打消顾虑。评议委员自己家庭的产、购、销定得是否合理，对他们的工作积极性和对群众的影响是很大的，因此，在制定方案、初步计算到户的时候，应当先公道、合理地评定好他们的产量购、数或销数，使他们自己先定下心来；他们自己做到以身作则，就可以取得群众的信任。
    三
    第三步是确定全乡“三定”方案，经过民主评议，把产、购、销数字合理地分配到户。这是贯彻执行“三定”政策最重要的一步。
    数字分配到户以前，党支部应当预先分析估计在群众中可能发生的问题，并在数字一分配到户后，就立即展开宣传活动，以便尽快地集中群众的意见，对“三定”的方案进行必要的调整。第三步工作一开始，即需要再一次召开人民代表大会会议，讨论、确定“三定”方案。方案最好在代表大会会议召开前，先在代表中酝酿、讨论好，取得大体一致的意见，并开始把数字分配到户。为了取得经验，少走弯路，可以先以一个村为试点，取得经验后再在全乡铺开。
    在确定方案，把数字分配到户的工作中，还应注意几个问题：
    第一，必须防止在定产过程中采用简单的作法。例如有的乡以购粮任务指标去套产量；有的乡不分土地好坏和经营条件，确定一个乡一个生产率，平均地分配数字；有的乡为了完成任务，故意提高产量；有的乡不是按常年产量定产，而是单纯按照群众所订的生产计划去定产。用这些办法定出来的产量，自然是不切合实际的，群众也不能接受。评定产量时，不但要根据土地质量和自然条件，还应当照顾农户的经营条件评定，因为同样土地经营条件悬殊时，产量也可能是悬殊的。
    第二，必须坚决贯彻执行“只购余粮，不购口粮”的政策。对这一点不容许有任何的动摇。要注意防止层层加派任务、加派周转粮的偏向；去年被多购或少购了余粮的农民，在调整他们今年的交售任务时，先应当向群众充分进行教育，然后进行调整，以免群众之间互相发生意见。
    第三，购销工作必须统一安排。应当再三向农民说明：今年从计划数字上看是少销粮食，但实际上只是减少了过去浪费的部分和纠正了供应不合理的部分，绝不是要削减合理的供应。同时，还应注意防止发生重购轻销思想和盲目压低销数的错误做法。
    在第三步工作完了准备转向第四步时，乡的“三定”工作可以暂时停一停，以便使县、区领导机关有足够的时间来研究和审查全县、全区同一批铺开“三定”工作的乡的“三定”数字分配情况，及时调整偏高偏低的地方。
    四
    第四步是审查批准，公布定案，总结工作，全力转向生产。
    在第三步工作结束后，第四步开始前，各级领导机关必须抓紧时机，组织力量，对前段工作中的政策执行情况进行一次全面、系统、深入的检查。要注意一个乡中还有多少户对“三定”数字不满意，了解“三定”到户以后还可能遗留下什么问题，以便在第四步妥善处理。
    然后，乡再召开人民代表大会会议，最后审查通过全乡各户的“三定”数字，向群众公布定案，同时总结“三定”工作。
    必须通过总结工作使代表们认识到党和国家的政策的正确性，认识到农民在建设社会主义当中的光荣任务，自觉地批判自己过去的错误认识。这是一场极有意义的关于工农联盟和社会主义的教育。工作人员也要就过去和这次工作中的工作作风进行批评和自我批评，以达到改正缺点，密切党同群众的关系的目的。
    总结完了，宣布“三定”工作结束，号召代表回去带动群众全力转向生产，迎接农业合作化运动的高潮。
