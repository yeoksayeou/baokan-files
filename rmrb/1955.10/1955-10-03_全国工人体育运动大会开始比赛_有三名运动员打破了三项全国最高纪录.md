The first National Workers' Games began on the 2nd. After the opening ceremony, many exciting track and field, ball game competitions, and group callisthenics performances were held. In four track and field events, three athletes broke three national records.

Forty-two athletes participated in the men's 800-meter preliminary round. They were divided into three groups for the competition. Li Zhonglin, an athlete from the Locomotive team in the third group, started with a steady pace and moved forward quickly. He ran faster and faster, and when he was 100 meters away from the finish line, he started sprinting. As a result, he broke the national record of 1 minute 57.7 seconds with a time of 1 minute 56 seconds.

The forty athletes participating in the 5,000-meter final had to run twelve laps each. Fu Shenghai of the Locomotive team finished the distance in 15 minutes and 15.6 seconds, breaking the national record of 15 minutes and 21 seconds.

In the women's javelin preliminary and final rounds, when Wang Yi, an athlete from the Dalian City education delegation, threw the javelin over the small red flag marking the national record on the field, she received warm applause from the audience. Her score of 34.44 meters was 32 centimeters farther than the national record.

In the last event of the track and field competition, the men's 200-meter low hurdles preliminary round, Wang Chonglun, a representative of the National People's Congress and an athlete from the Heavy Industry delegation, won the group championship. The audience was very excited about his victory.

The football match on the 2nd was between the First Machine Team and the Locomotive Football Team. These two teams had not been defeated since the start of the ball game finals. The two teams were evenly matched, and in the end, the First Machine Team won by only one to zero. The audience cheered and applauded countless times for their wonderful performances. Before the track and field and ball game competitions, 1,530 male and female workers in Beijing performed the familiar broadcast calisthenics. Because their movements were skilled and uniform, the audience still felt very fresh. Then, students from the Beijing Normal University Affiliated Women's Middle School performed rhythmic gymnastics that combined dance and gymnastics movements, accompanied by piano. Students from the Central Institute of Physical Education performed rhythmic baton exercises and free exercises with a strong sense of rhythm.

At night, at the Beijing Municipal Labor People's Cultural Palace Stadium and Beihai Stadium, the eight teams participating in the men's and women's basketball and volleyball finals also played four games.
