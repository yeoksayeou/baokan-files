    The Ministry of Petroleum Industry Convenes First Meeting of Factory and Mine Directors
    Arranges Production and Capital Construction Plans for 1956
    At the end of September, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry convened its first meeting of factory and mine directors since its establishment, arranging the production and capital construction plans for the petroleum industry in 1956 and making arrangements for the work in the fourth quarter of this year.
    After discussion, the meeting considered that the production policy of the petroleum industry in 1956 should be to fully utilize the capacity of existing equipment, adopt various technical measures to increase production, and ensure the needs of the country to the maximum extent. Compared with the plan for 1955, the total output value of the petroleum industry in 1956 will increase by 18 percent, and crude oil production will increase by more than 20 percent. The production of light oil such as gasoline, kerosene, and light diesel, as well as lubricating oil and transformer oil, will also increase significantly next year. In 1956, the capital construction of the petroleum industry should still implement the policy of focusing on key construction projects, and all efforts should be made to ensure the progress and quality of productive construction, reduce investment in non-productive construction, so as to ensure that the construction projects for increasing production capacity during the first five-year plan can be completed on schedule. Compared with the planned number for 1955, the total investment in capital construction of the petroleum industry in 1956 will increase by more than 42 percent, the total drilling footage of petroleum wells will increase by approximately 67 percent, and the teams for geological surveying, topographic and geodetic surveying, and geophysical prospecting will be correspondingly strengthened, with the number of teams increasing by more than 30 percent.
    In order to meet these tasks for the coming year, the meeting unanimously agreed that preparations must be grasped and done well in the fourth quarter of this year. In terms of production, it is necessary to focus on solving the problem of crude oil desalting and dewatering, fully study the operating methods adapted to the changes in inferior oil shale, do a good job in the trial operation and production of low-temperature retorting, continue to reorganize labor organization, and further carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy. In terms of capital construction, it is necessary to actively prepare to strengthen the construction force, vigorously train and concentrate the technical workers and cadres needed by each construction unit. For the engineering projects of 1956, especially the major engineering projects, design must be grasped tightly, and the design progress and delivery date of the design must be specifically stipulated. We must seize the design of drilling for oil storage structures, determine the well locations to be drilled in the first quarter of next year, and do a good job in the supply of drilling equipment.
    The meeting also conducted a full discussion on the main measures for increasing the production of natural crude oil and synthetic petroleum. (Xinhua News Agency)

    石油工业部召开第一次厂矿长会议
    安排一九五六年的生产和基本建设计划
    石油工业部在九月底，召开成立以来的第一次厂矿长会议，安排了一九五六年石油工业的生产和基本建设计划，并对今年第四季工作作了布置。
    会议经过讨论，认为一九五六年石油工业的生产方针应是充分发挥现有设备能力，采取各种技术措施以增加产量，在最大限度内保证国家的需要。同一九五五年的计划比较，一九五六年石油工业的生产总值将增长百分之十八，原油产量将增长百分之二十以上，汽油、煤油、轻柴油等轻质油类和润滑油、变压器油等明年都将大量增产。一九五六年石油工业基本建设仍应贯彻重点建设的方针，要用一切努力来保证生产性建设的进度和质量，减少非生产性建设的投资，以确保在第一个五年计划内增加生产能力的建设工程能够如期完成。同一九五五年的计划数比较，一九五六年石油工业基本建设的总投资额将增长百分之四十二以上，石油钻井的总进尺数将增长约百分之六十七，地质测量、地形及大地测量和地球物理探矿等队伍将相应壮大，队数将增长百分之三十以上。
    为了迎接明年度的这些任务，会议一致认为，在今年第四季度内就必须抓紧做好准备工作。在生产方面，要着重解决原油脱盐脱水的问题，充分研究适应劣质油母页岩变化的操作方法，作好低温干馏的试运转生产工作，继续整顿劳动组织和进一步开展增产节约运动。在基本建设方面，要积极准备壮大施工力量，大力培养和集中各建设单位所需要的技术工人和干部。对一九五六年的工程项目，特别是主要工程项目，必须抓紧设计，具体规定设计进度和设计的交付日期。抓紧做好储油构造的钻探设计，定出明年第一季度需要开钻的井位，作好钻井器材的供应工作。
    会议对增产天然原油和人造石油的主要措施，也进行了充分的讨论。　　　　（新华社）
