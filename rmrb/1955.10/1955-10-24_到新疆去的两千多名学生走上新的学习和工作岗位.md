    More Than Two Thousand Students Who Went to Xinjiang Take Up New Study and Work Posts
    The more than two thousand graduating middle school students from Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu and other provinces who came to Xinjiang to participate in construction have already taken up new study and work posts.
    These more than two thousand young students arrived in Xinjiang in batches during August and September. More than one-third of them were assigned to Xinjiang August 1st Agricultural College to study various specialized agricultural knowledge. More than one hundred were assigned to health schools to study medical work. The rest were assigned according to need and in combination with each student's specific circumstances to participate in various production and construction work in the Urumqi, Manas River Basin, Yili, Hami, Southern Xinjiang and other military reclamation areas, as well as short-term study in agricultural training classes run by the reclamation areas.
    After these young students arrived in the reclamation areas, they were warmly welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the commanders and fighters of the production units. Many units held welcome parties for them, and the unit leaders introduced them to the course of production and construction in Xinjiang by the troops in recent years. They also visited the large-scale military farms. Zhou Songlin, a graduate of Yichuan First Junior High School in Henan, said after visiting the cotton fields of a mechanized farm of a certain unit in the Manas River Reclamation Area: "I used to hear people say that Xinjiang was very barren and that no plants grew, but I didn't expect that such good crops could grow, and one mu could yield 400 to 500 jin of cotton!" He expressed his desire to study and work hard to build Xinjiang into a better place.

    到新疆去的两千多名学生走上新的学习和工作岗位
    由河北、河南及江苏等地到新疆参加建设的两千多名今年应届中学毕业学生，已经走上了新的学习岗位和工作岗位。
    这两千多名青年学生，在八、九月内分批抵达新疆。其中有三分之一以上被分配在新疆八一农学院，学习各种农业专门知识。有一百多名分配在卫生学校学习医务工作。其余按需要并结合每个学生的具体情况，分别分配在乌鲁木齐、玛纳斯河流域、伊犁、哈密、南疆等部队垦区参加各项生产建设工作和垦区举办的农业训练班的短期学习。
    这批青年学生到达垦区以后，受到新疆各族人民和生产部队指战员的热烈欢迎。很多单位为他们举行了欢迎晚会，部队首长向他们介绍了几年来部队在新疆生产建设的经过。他们还参观了规模巨大的部队农场。由河南伊川第一初中毕业的学生周松林，参观了玛纳斯河垦区某部机耕农场的棉田以后，他说：“以前听人说新疆很荒凉，草木不生，哪晓得能长出这样好的庄稼，一亩地竟能收到四、五百斤棉花呢！”他表示要努力学习和工作，把新疆建设得更加美好。
