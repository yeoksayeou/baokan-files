　　Yuan Lihua, a Communist Party member who has been named an outstanding teacher in Sichuan Province and Chengdu City three times, is a homeroom teacher for a lower grade class at Longjiang Road Primary School in Chengdu. Most of the forty-eight students in her class have excellent grades, and more than half of the children have joined the Young Pioneers. This class was once an outstanding class at Longjiang Road Primary School. Du Changming, a student who studied in this class, still misses his beloved teacher Yuan Lihua after leaving Chengdu and returning to his hometown in Anhui, and writes to tell her about his current studies and life.

　　This spring break, something happened in Yuan Lihua's class. A child named Cao Minsheng quietly fished a small goldfish from the pond in the park. The children criticized him for damaging the school's honor. Yuan Lihua thought of Cao Minsheng's love of living things from this incident. In addition to educating Cao Minsheng to recognize the mistake of catching fish privately, she also asked Cao Minsheng's mother to buy him two chicks, and she also told the child many stories of biologists, encouraging him to study scientific knowledge hard. Cao Minsheng has since studied hard, and his homework often gets full marks. In a composition, he wrote: I want to study hard and become a good student of Michurin in the future.

　　When Yuan Lihua started as a teacher, there were many difficulties. She went to the classrooms where veteran teachers taught every day to listen to lectures, and tirelessly studied books on pedagogy. In her work, she paid special attention to cultivating children's communist moral qualities. In the first half of last year, Yuan Lihua discovered that some of the children in her class wanted to become scientists or join the People's Liberation Army in the future, but did not respect ordinary labor. Some children were embarrassed when they met teachers while cutting grass or doing laundry. Yuan Lihua told the children stories of outstanding workers, and also organized a joint class meeting with two other class teachers. They took some children to visit several parents and teachers in advance. At the class meeting, the children talked about the labor their mothers, teachers, and workers had put in to educate them. They said: We must also be good workers. The children often helped the school workers clean up afterwards.

　　Lai Wugen, the child with the best grades in Yuan Lihua's class, has been named an outstanding student in the class six times. However, this child is unwilling to help others. He can draw, but he is unwilling to draw wall newspapers for the class. In the second half of last year, the children elected him as the study group leader, but he refused. Yuan Lihua often used stories of model figures helping each other to educate him, encouraging him to correct his shortcomings. Later, Lai Wugen wrote in a composition: I want to be a good worker like Wang Chonglun, but now I am unwilling to help others. How can I build the motherland well in the future? Yuan Lihua read this composition to all the children in the class, encouraging them to help each other. Since then, Lai Wugen has often helped children who missed classes with tutoring after school. Before "June 1st" Children's Day, he also participated in the class's toy group, making toys to give to the kindergarten class.

　　Yuan Lihua is determined to devote her life to the people's education cause. She said: "Seeing these children grow up day by day, this is the greatest happiness!"

    优秀的女教师 
    新华社记者　周祖佑
    曾三次被评为四川省和成都市优秀教师的共产党员袁丽华，是成都市龙江路小学一个低年级的班主任。她班上的四十八个学生大部分成绩优良，有一半以上的孩子加入了少年先锋队，这个班级曾经是龙江路小学的优秀班。在这个班上学习过的学生杜昌明离开成都回到他的家乡安徽后，还惦念着他敬爱的老师袁丽华，写信告诉她关于他目前的学习和生活情况。
    今年春假，袁丽华的班上曾发生了一件事。一个叫曹闽生的孩子从公园的水池里悄悄地捞了一尾小金鱼。孩子们都批评他破坏学校荣誉。袁丽华从这一事件想到了曹闽生欢喜生物的特点。她除了教育曹闽生认识私自捉鱼的错误外，还请曹闽生的妈妈给他买了两只小鸡，她又给孩子讲了许多生物学家的故事，鼓励他努力学习科学常识。曹闽生从此用功学习，家庭作业经常得到五分。他在一次作文中写道：我要好好学习，将来作个米丘林的好学生。
    袁丽华开始当教员时，困难很多。她每天到老教师上课的课堂听课，不倦地学习有关教育学的书籍。她在工作中特别注意培养孩子们的共产主义道德品质。去年上半年，袁丽华发现班上的儿童有些想将来做科学家或参加人民解放军，但不尊重平凡的劳动。有的孩子割草和洗衣时遇见老师，还觉得不好意思。袁丽华就给孩子们讲优秀劳动者的故事，还和其他班级的两个教师组织了一次联合班会。她们事先带一些孩子访问了几位家长和老师。在班会上，孩子们谈到他们的妈妈、老师和工友为了教育自己付出的劳动。他们说：我们也要做个好劳动者。孩子们以后常常帮助学校工人打扫清洁。
    袁丽华班上有个成绩最好的孩子赖梧根，曾六次被评为全班优等生。但是，这孩子不愿帮助人。他会画，却不肯为班上画墙报。去年下半年，孩子们选他当学习小组长，他也不干。袁丽华经常用模范人物互相帮助的故事教育他，鼓励他改正自己的缺点。后来赖梧根在作文中写道：我要做个王崇伦样的好工人，我现在却不愿帮助人，将来怎么能把祖国建设好呢？袁丽华向全班孩子念了这篇作文，鼓励孩子们互相帮助。此后，赖梧根就常常在放学后帮助缺课的孩子补习功课。“六一”儿童节前，他还参加了班上的玩具组，制造玩具送给幼儿班。
    袁丽华决心把一生贡献给人民教育事业。她说：“看见这些孩子们一天天成长，这是最大的幸福！”
