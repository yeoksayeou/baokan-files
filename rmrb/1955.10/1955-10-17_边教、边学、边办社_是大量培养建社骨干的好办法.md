    "Teaching, Learning, and Running Co-ops Simultaneously" is a Good Way to Train a Large Number of Co-op Cadres
    Yang Zhengsen, Wu Rong
    Using various methods to train a large number of co-op cadres is an important issue in迎 (welcome) the current new upsurge of agricultural collectivization. The Jin Tan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangsu Province recently selected forty-two townships with relatively strong Party branch leadership and a good foundation of mutual aid and cooperation from the county's sixty-four townships and towns. They promoted the "teaching, learning, and running co-ops simultaneously" method, which had proven effective in pilot townships, and trained over three thousand co-op cadres on the spot. This led to the establishment of four hundred and eighty-seven agricultural production cooperatives, accelerating the progress of the movement.
    The Jin Tan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party saw that the high tide of co-op establishment had arrived, the broad masses urgently demanded the establishment of co-ops, and that the situation was pressing and the tasks were arduous. Under these circumstances, relying solely on centralized training of co-op cadres at the county and district levels could no longer meet the needs. Therefore, in addition to training one thousand seven hundred and eighteen core members of the new cooperatives in two batches at the county level, they also provided short-term training to all resident co-op staff members and core leadership members of the township branches. They also selected thirty-three district committee-level staff members and above with considerable work experience and teaching ability, and led them down to the townships to help the branches train co-op cadres on the spot, while simultaneously carrying out co-op establishment work. Previously, the county committee conducted experiments on this method in Taoxi and Zhuzhuang townships. The results of the experiment proved that this method has many advantages. In twenty days, these two townships successfully established thirty-two new cooperatives, with participating peasant households reaching 62% and 71% of the total peasant households, respectively, more than doubling the original number of participating households. Furthermore, many farmers were still applying to join the cooperatives. The two hundred and twenty new co-op cadres who had been trained generally worked very well and began to grow in practical struggle.
    The first advantage of this method is that it is learned and applied immediately, making it easy to digest. Teach a lesson, learn a lesson, and do it immediately after learning; do a step, check a step, and solve problems at any time; the training ends, the new cooperative is established, quickly and steadily. The training process generally only requires three lessons. The first lesson is "Why should we run co-ops?" Based on the spirit of the General Line and the country's First Five-Year Plan, and in connection with examples from the township, explain the benefits of agricultural cooperatives and compare them with the shortcomings of small-scale peasant economy, to encourage the enthusiasm of farmers for running co-ops and to strengthen the confidence of cadres in running co-ops; the second lesson is "How to run co-ops?" Explain the principles, guidelines, policies, and specific problem-solving methods for establishing co-ops, especially emphasizing the implementation of the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and the implementation of class policy; the third lesson is "How to run co-ops well?" Explain how to implement democratic management, formulate production plans, promote the contract work system, and do a good job in operation and management. When teaching this lesson, simultaneously mobilize the new cooperatives to formulate autumn harvest and autumn planting plans. Each lesson lasts about two hours. After learning a lesson, the trainees return to the village to promote that lesson to the masses, while promoting it while carrying out co-op establishment work, and reporting the co-op establishment situation to the branch. Because the examples given in the township are mostly local, real people and real events, which are easy to understand and remember, the trainees can convey the learned principles and methods more completely after returning to the village, and the effect is very good. For example, Cao Wenliang, the head of a mutual aid group in Zhuzhuang Village, said: "When I go to the county to study, my mind is not very good, and I can't remember everything when I go home. After rambling on all night in the village, I can tell it all. Now I learn and sell immediately, and the policy is not easy to go out of shape." Before the lesson, the co-op establishment work of the co-op establishment base in the township has already taken a step. During the lesson, let the pioneering co-op cadres and old co-op cadres share their experiences. The trainees feel that they not only understand the principles, but also have role models, and move forward step by step without detours. Because attention is paid to discovering problems at any time and making up lessons at any time, "half-cooked rice" is avoided. The second lesson is more difficult and the specific problems are complex. Taoxi and other townships spend a day focusing on cadres to make up lessons, roughly formulating the plans of each cooperative for handling specific problems, and then letting them return to the village to implement and revise them. Zhuzhuang Township found that the land share grading of the new cooperatives in Fanchuan and Dong Wanshi villages was unreasonable, so the pioneering cooperative introduced experience, so that the bias was corrected in time.
    The second advantage of this method is that it is easy to mobilize old cooperatives to lead new cooperatives, so that new and old cooperatives can advance together. In order to solve the problem of insufficient leadership, the branch uniformly selected old cooperative cadres sent by old cooperatives or hired by new cooperatives, and let them participate in the "training class" in the township, serve as group leaders in the study, and serve as instructors in the new cooperatives, from the beginning of promoting co-op establishment to running the co-op well. Many old co-op cadres said: "Doing this helps others and improves ourselves. I didn't pay attention to some problems in my own cooperative a long time ago. This time, when I compare it with the policy, I will correct them easily." They have all established close relationships with the members of the new cooperatives, laying a favorable foundation for long-term guidance and leadership of the new cooperatives in the future. Because the training is in the township, the road is very close, and it is also very convenient to visit the old cooperatives. On September 19, after the Zhuzhuang Township Branch of the Communist Party of China held a meeting of new and old co-op cadres, it invited the staff of eighteen new cooperatives to visit the first and fourth cooperatives in the township, which were doing better, and exchanged a lot of specific experience in production management. The old cooperatives' technical improvements and manure accumulation achievements surprised the new co-op cadres. They said: "The benefits of agricultural cooperatives are truly well-deserved. Hearing and seeing, even a papaya can be enlightened."
    The third advantage of this method is that it further implements the policy of "the secretary taking action and the whole Party running cooperatives" and "overall planning and strengthening leadership." Liu Fucheng, secretary of the Taoxi Township Branch, said: "In the past, it was mainly the district committee and the county committee secretary who took action, and the branch secretary relied on the help of the superiors. Now the branch secretary's responsibility is heavier. Not only must he be able to run the cooperative, but also teach others. If he doesn't do a good job, it won't work." The leadership responsibility of the branch has been increased, and the ability to fight independently has also been improved. In the training, first pay attention to improving the consciousness of Party members, enhancing the confidence in running cooperatives, and mobilizing Party members to be models in learning; second, strengthen overall planning, carefully review the co-op establishment targets, cadre components, and member status, and arrange them in a unified and comprehensive manner; then, add them to training in batches in a planned manner. Once these few things are done, many branch committee members can independently guide the work of running cooperatives. They feel that the cooperatives are run well, the work is also easy to do, and they can see farther.
    Another advantage of this method is that the country saves money and the farmers save work. Because it is not necessary to concentrate all the co-op establishment cadres in the county and district for training, the training costs are saved, and the total savings for the county are 6,000 yuan. The farmers also praised this method as a good method that "does not interfere with production, co-op establishment, and 'three fixings'." Using this method, the co-op establishment time is saved by seven to ten days compared to the time when they returned from training in the county, and the number of trainees per cooperative has increased by nearly double. Because of on-site training and on-site co-op establishment, co-op establishment cadres do not need to be separated from production. Under their active leadership, the production enthusiasm of farmers preparing to run co-ops has greatly improved. The efficiency of Wang Ruhua's mutual aid group's agricultural boat dredging grass and slag in Nanshe Township increased by one-third during the co-op establishment period. They used the achievement of accumulating 50% more wheat field base fertilizer than last year to welcome the establishment of the new cooperative. The co-op establishment cadres in Jiuli Village led the village's cooperatives and groups to unite to fight drought, rescuing 45 mu of rice seedlings in five days. Xu Shukang, the head of a mutual aid group in Shetou Township, said: "In the past, I was afraid that meetings would interfere with production, but now I am only afraid that there are too few lessons. Listen more, and the cooperative will be run better!"
    Because the above-mentioned methods were adopted, the original plan of the Jintan County Committee to establish 711 cooperatives this winter and next spring can be completed ahead of schedule. By October, 908 new cooperatives with 20,800 households participating can be established, and the number of participating households will increase from 13.7% of the total households this spring to 50%. The current county committee has followed the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the resolutions of the Jiangsu Provincial Congress to further implement the policy of "overall planning and strengthening leadership," and has once again revised the indicators of agricultural collectivization. It has also sent county committee members to various districts to inspect the co-op establishment work in the previous stage, so that all the cooperatives that have been established in the county can quickly put into production.

    “边教、边学、边办社”是大量培养建社骨干的好办法
    杨正森　吴镕
    运用各种方法，培养大量办社骨干，是迎接当前农业合作化新高潮中一个重要问题。中共江苏省金坛县委最近在全县六十四个乡、镇中，选择了支部领导较强和互助合作基础较好的四十二个乡，推广了在试点乡行之有效的“边教、边学、边办社”的方法，就地训练了三千多名办社骨干，建成了四百八十七个农业生产合作社，加速了运动的进展。
    中共金坛县委看到建社高潮已经到来，广大群众迫切要求建社，时机紧迫，任务繁重，在这种情况下，单靠县、区集中训练建社骨干已不能满足需要。因此，除在县里分两批训练了新社的骨干分子一千七百十八名外，又把全县驻社工作人员、乡支部领导骨干加以短期训练，并挑选了三十三名有相当工作经验和讲授能力的区委级以上工作人员，带领他们下乡，帮助支部就地训练办社骨干，同时开展建社工作。事先，县委在洮西和朱庄两乡对这个办法进行了试验。试验结果，证明这种办法好处很多。这两乡在二十天内，就顺利地建成三十二个新社，入社农户达到总农户的百分之六十二和百分之七十一，均比原有入社农户增加了一倍多，而且还有很多农民在申请入社。经过训练的二百二十个新社骨干，一般都工作得很好，他们在实际斗争中开始成长起来了。
    这种办法的第一个好处是现学现用，容易消化。讲一课，学一课，学了就做；做一步，查一步，随时发现问题随时解决问题；训练结束，新社建成，快而且稳。训练过程一般只要上三课。第一课是“为什么要办社”，根据总路线和国家第一个五年计划的精神联系本乡实例，讲农业合作社的好处并对比小农经济的短处，鼓舞农民办社热情和坚定骨干办社信心；第二课是“怎样办社”，讲建社的方针、原则、政策及具体问题的处理办法，特别强调执行自愿互利原则和贯彻阶级政策；第三课是“怎样办好社”，说明如何实行民主管理、订立生产计划、推行包工制度和做好经营管理。在讲这一课时，同时发动新建社订好秋收秋种计划。每课讲授时间两小时左右。受训的人学完一课就回村向群众宣传一课，一边宣传一边开展建社工作，并把建社情况向支部汇报。因为在乡里听课举例多是本地的活人活事，好懂好记，受训的人回村后能把学过的道理和办法较完全地传达下去，效果很好。如朱庄村互助组长曹文良说：“到县里学习，我脑子又不大好，学多了回家记不完全，到村上东扯西拉一夜就讲光了。现在现学现卖，政策不容易走样了。”在上课前，本乡建社基点的建社工作先做了一步。上课时让先行的建社骨干和老社骨干现身说法，受训的人觉得既懂了道理，又有了榜样，一步一步往前走，不走弯路。因为注意随时发现问题，随时补课，避免了烧“夹生饭”。第二课比较难，具体问题复杂，洮西等乡都花一天时间集中骨干进行了补课，把各社处理具体问题的方案大体订好，再让他们回村贯彻修订。朱庄乡发现樊川和东万士两村的新社土地入股等级评得不合理，就由先行社介绍经验，使偏向得到及时纠正。
    这种办法的第二个好处是便于发动老社带新社，使新老社能一同前进。为了解决领导人员不足的问题，支部统一挑选了老社派出或新社聘请的老社骨干，让他们参加乡里的“训练班”，在学习中担任小组长，到新社去担任辅导员，从开始宣传办社到把社办好为止。不少老社骨干说：“这样做，帮助了旁人，也提高了自己。自己社里老早有些毛病没注意，这次一对照政策，也就顺手纠正过来了。”他们都同新社社员建立了亲密的感情，为今后长期地对新社进行辅导、带动打下了有利基础。因为在本乡训练，路很近，到老社参观也很便当。九月十九日，中共朱庄乡支部在新老社骨干开了碰头会后，又请十八个新建社的工作人员参观了乡里办得较好的第一社和第四社，交流了不少生产管理的具体经验。老社的技术改进和积肥的成绩使新社骨干很惊奇，他们说：“农业合作社的好处真是名不虚传，听到看到，木瓜也能开窍了。”
    这种办法第三个好处是进一步贯彻了“书记动手，全党办社”和“全面规划，加强领导”的方针。洮西乡支部书记刘复成说：“过去主要还是区委和县委书记动手，支部书记专靠上级帮忙。现在支部书记责任重了，不仅自己要会办社而且还要教会旁人，不好好干也不行了。”支部的领导责任加重了，独立作战的能力也提高了。在训练中，首先注意提高党员觉悟，增强办社信心，动员党员在学习中做模范；其次是加强全面规划，认真把建社对象、骨干成分，社员情况审查清楚，统一全面安排；然后有计划地分批加以训练。这几件事一办，很多支部委员都能独当一面地指导办社工作了，他们觉得社办好了，工作也好做了，自己眼睛也看得远了。
    这种办法还有个好处是国家省钱，农民省工。因为不用把所有建社骨干都集中到县、区去训练，节省了训练费用，计全县共节省国家开支六千元。农民也称赞这办法是“生产、办社和‘三定’三不误”的好办法。采用这个办法，办社时间比在县里受训了回来再办节省了七天到十天，而每个社受训人数增加近一倍。因为就地训练、就地办社，办社骨干不用脱离生产，在他们积极带动下，准备办社的农民生产积极性大大提高了。南社乡王儒华互助组的农船罱草渣，建社期间效率提高了三分之一，他们用比去年多积五成麦田基肥的成绩迎接了新社的成立。九里村办社骨干带动了本村社、组联合起来进行抗旱，五天抢救稻苗四十五亩。社头乡互助组长徐须康说：“过去开会怕误生产，现在只怕上课太少。多听一点，社才办得更好！”
    因为采用了上述办法，原来金坛县委打算今冬明春建社七百十一个的计划，可以提前超额完成。到十月份就可办好有二万零八百户参加的九百零八个新社，入社农户由今春占总农户的百分之十三点七上升到百分之五十。现县委已遵照党中央的指示，和江苏省代表会议的决议进一步贯彻“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，再一次修订了农业合作化的指标。并派出县委委员分赴各区检查前一阶段的建社工作，使全县已建成的社都能很快地投入生产。
