What Reason Is There to Use the Excuse of Implementing the Agreement to Delay the Sino-US Talks?

The issue of Americans in China returning home and the issue of Chinese in the United States returning home are two problems of not entirely the same nature. Since the Sino-US ambassadorial-level talks reached an agreement on the issue of civilians returning home on both sides on September 10th, people have legitimate reasons to believe that these two problems of not entirely the same nature have been reasonably resolved, and the Sino-US talks will further discuss and resolve other practical issues over which both sides have disputes. However, people cannot help but notice that while the Chinese side is faithfully implementing the agreement already reached by both sides, the US side has not yet shown any active performance in implementing the agreement. Not only that, but US news agencies are also creating the impression that China may "renege" on the agreement. US official spokesmen even claim that it is too early to discuss other issues before the agreement is fulfilled, attempting to use this as an excuse to obstruct the progress of the Sino-US talks.

Americans in China, like any other foreign nationals, have always enjoyed the right to return home. China has never obstructed Americans from returning home. From the founding of the People's Republic of China to the five-year period when China and the United States began contact in Geneva last year on the issue of civilians returning home, more than 1,400 Americans left China, including 97 Americans who committed crimes in China. Therefore, when China and the United States began contact last year on the issue of civilians returning home, the number of Americans in China was already very small, only about 120. After the Sino-US sides began contact, the Chinese side told the US side that ordinary American nationals in China, as long as there are no civil or criminal cases, can leave China at any time; even for Americans who have committed crimes in China, China will adopt a lenient policy, reducing sentences and releasing them early at its discretion, based on their crimes and performance. From that time until the beginning of the Sino-US ambassadorial talks this year, the Chinese side specifically notified the US side of 27 Americans who were leaving the country, including 10 Americans who had committed crimes in China. All of these people have returned to the United States. Since the start of the Sino-US talks, the Chinese side has specifically notified the US side of another 33 Americans who should and could leave the country, including 21 Americans who committed crimes in China. The majority of these people have already left China. The fact that the vast majority of Americans in China have returned home in the past six years shows that not only do ordinary American nationals fully enjoy the right to return home, but also the vast majority of the more than 140 Americans who committed crimes have been treated leniently.

Now there are only two categories of Americans remaining in China, totaling 66 people. The first category is 47 Americans who have not applied to return home. Any of these Americans can leave China at any time if they apply to return home at any time. The second category is 19 Americans who have committed crimes. The Chinese side is continuing to review them individually in accordance with the agreement and according to Chinese legal procedures. For the cases of Americans who have committed crimes, the Chinese government will, after completing the review, notify the British representative office entrusted by the US government of the results of the review and the handling measures determined accordingly in accordance with the agreement.

These facts all show that the Chinese side is keeping its own promises and is faithfully implementing the agreement between the two sides.

However, on the other hand, the situation encountered by Chinese in the United States is very different. For a long time, many innocent Chinese have been subjected to various threats, persecution, and obstructions, and cannot return home, and their only "crime" is that they demand to return to their motherland. Since China and the United States began contact last year, the US side has notified the Chinese side several times that the US government has lifted the exit ban on 103 Chinese who had applied to return home but were prevented from returning home by the US government. However, many of these 103 people have still not returned to China. According to a report by the United Press, Mr. Qian Xuesen, who had been detained by the US government for five years and recently left the United States, pointed out on his way back to China that there are currently more than 100 students in the United States waiting for the US government to allow them to leave the United States. The US State Department admitted in a public statement on April 2 this year that "some Chinese students are afraid to apply to the Immigration and Naturalization Service to leave the United States for fear of being rejected." Therefore, the number of Chinese who have been afraid to apply to return home due to long-term threats and persecution is obviously more than 100. There are tens of thousands of Chinese nationals in the United States; from the time China and the United States began contact last year to the time when China and the United States reached an agreement on the issue of civilians returning home, the proportion of overseas Chinese and students who returned to China from the United States in the total number of Chinese in the United States was negligible.

After an agreement was reached on the issue of civilians returning home on both sides, the US State Department claimed on September 20 that three Chinese left the United States on September 17. However, the US State Department even claimed at the same time that these three people were the "last batch" of Chinese students who asked to return home!

If it is said that any party is likely to "renege" on the agreement, it is not difficult to see which side it is.

It should be pointed out that the Chinese in the United States and the Americans in China not only differ greatly in number, but also the nature of their return home issues is not entirely the same. The vast majority of Chinese in the United States do not have any civil or criminal cases, but have been prevented from returning home for a long time. After the agreement on the return of civilians on both sides was reached, it is clear that the US government should take measures to enable these innocent Chinese nationals and students to return home immediately. Law-abiding American nationals in China have always been able to leave China at any time; even American nationals with outstanding civil cases have been assisted and can return home soon. As for Americans who have committed crimes in China, they must go through a review in accordance with Chinese legal procedures before they can exercise their right to return home. The Chinese side will review their cases as soon as possible in accordance with the agreement and determine appropriate measures.

The Chinese side is faithfully implementing the agreement on the return of civilians on both sides. The Chinese side is not satisfied with the US side's implementation of the agreement. However, the Chinese side is willing to urge the US side to actively implement the agreement through the Republic of India it entrusted, and has not made the issue of implementing the agreement an obstacle to the continuation of the Sino-US talks. The Chinese side also recognizes that the implementation of the agreement takes time, especially since there are a large number of Chinese in the United States, and it takes a considerable period of time for all those who wish to return home to be able to return home. Therefore, the Chinese side has not made unreasonable claims that discussions and resolutions on other practical issues over which China and the United States have disputes should be carried out only after all Chinese who wish to return home have returned home. People have every right to question the US side: What reason is there to use the excuse of implementing the agreement to obstruct the progress of the talks?

### 有什么理由以执行协议为借口来拖延中美会谈？

    有什么理由以执行协议为借口来拖延中美会谈？
    在美中国人的回国问题和在华美国人的回国问题是两个性质不完全相同的问题。由于中美两国大使级的会谈在九月十日对双方平民回国问题达成了协议，人们有正当的理由认为，这两个性质不完全相同的问题都已获得合理的解决，而中美会谈将进一步讨论和解决双方有所争执的其他实际问题。但是，人们却不能不注意到，虽然中国方面正在忠实地实施着双方已经达成的协议，美国方面却还没有实施协议的积极表现。不仅如此，美国通讯社更在制造中国可能“背弃”协议的印象。美国官方发言人甚至声称在协议履行以前，讨论其他问题未免为时过早，企图以这种借口来阻挠中美会谈的进展。
    在中国的美国人，同任何其他外国侨民一样，一向享有回国的权利。中国从来没有阻挠美侨回国。从中华人民共和国成立到中美两国去年在日内瓦就双方平民回国问题开始接触的五年期间，一千四百余名美国人离开了中国，其中包括九十七名在中国犯法的美国人。因此，去年中美双方就平民回国问题开始接触的时候，在中国的美侨人数就已经很少，不过一百二十人左右。中美双方开始接触后，中国方面曾经告诉美方，在中国的一般美国侨民，只要没有民刑案件，都可以随时离境；就是对于在中国犯法的美国人，中国也将采取宽大的政策，按照他们本人的罪行和表现，酌情减刑和提前释放。从那时起到今年中美两国大使级会谈开始的一年期间，中国方面具体通知了美方二十七名离境的美国人，其中十人是在中国犯法的美国人。这些人全部都回到了美国。自从中美会谈开始以来，中国方面又具体通知了美方三十三名应该和可以离境的美国人，包括二十一名在中国犯法的美国人。这些人中绝大部分已经离开了中国。六年来绝大多数在华美国人已经回国的事实，说明了不仅一般的美侨充分享有回国的权利，而且在一百四十余名犯法的美国人中绝大部分也已经得到了宽大的处理。
    现在剩下来的只有两类在华美国人，共六十六人。第一类是没有申请回国的美侨四十七名。在这一类美侨中，任何人在任何时候提出回国的申请，都可以随时离开中国。第二类是十九名犯法的美国人。中国方面正在按照协议，根据中国的法律程序，继续逐个予以审查。对于犯法美国人的案件，中国政府在审查完毕后也将按照协议把审查的结果和据此而确定的处理办法通知受美国政府委托的联合王国代办处。
    这些事实都说明了，中国方面是遵守它自己的诺言的，而且正在忠实地实施着双方的协议。
    但是，另一方面，在美国的中国人所遭遇的情况却很不相同。长期以来，许多无辜的中国人受到了种种的威胁、迫害和阻难，不能回国，而他们唯一的罪名就是他们要求回到他们的祖国。自从去年中美双方开始接触以来，美国方面曾几次通知中国方面，美国政府对一百零三名曾经申请回国但被美国政府阻止不能回国的中国人，撤销了离境禁令。但是在这一百零三人中，却至今还有许多人没有回到中国。根据合众社的报道，被美国政府留难了五年之久、最近才离开美国的钱学森先生在回国途中就指出，当前在美国还有一百多名学生等待美国政府准许他们离开美国。美国国务院在今年四月二日的公开声明中就承认，“有些中国学生由于害怕遭受拒绝而不敢向移民归化局申请离开美国。”因此，由于长期遭受威胁和迫害而一直不敢提出回国要求的中国人显然不止一百余人。中国在美国的侨民数以万计；从去年中美双方开始接触，到中美双方对平民回国问题达成协议时为止，从美国回到中国的华侨和留学生的人数在全部在美国的中国人中所占的比例是微不足道的。
    在双方平民回国问题达成协议后，美国国务院在九月二十日声称，三个中国人在九月十七日离开了美国。但是，美国国务院同时竟声称这三个人是要求回国的中国学生中的“最后一批”！
    如果说，任何一方有可能“背弃”协议的话，人们不难看出这究竟是哪一方面。
    应该指出：在美国的中国人同在中国的美国人，不仅人数相差悬殊，而且他们回国问题的性质也不完全相同。绝大多数在美国的中国人，没有任何民刑案件，但是却长期被阻不能回国。双方平民回国协议达成后，显然美国政府应该采取措施，使这些无辜的中国侨民和留学生立即能够回国。在中国的守法美侨一向可以随时离开中国；就是有着未了民事案件的美侨，也已经获得协助，随即可以回国。至于在中国犯罪的美国人，他们必须按照中国的法律程序经过审查以后，才有可能行使回国的权利。中国方面将根据协议，尽速审查他们的案件，确定适当的措施。
    中国方面正在忠实实施双方平民回国的协议。中国方面对于美方执行协议的情况是不能满意的。但是，中国方面愿意通过它所委托的印度共和国促使美方积极实施协议，并没有使执行协议的问题成为中美会谈继续进行的障碍。中国方面也认识到，协议的实施是需要时间的，特别是在美国的中国人为数很多，需要相当长的时期才能使愿意回国者全部得以回国。因此，中国方面也没有提出不合理的说法，要在愿意回国的中国人全部回国后才对中美双方有所争执的其他实际问题进行讨论和解决。人们有充分的权利质问美方：有什么理由以执行协议为借口来阻挠会谈的进展。
