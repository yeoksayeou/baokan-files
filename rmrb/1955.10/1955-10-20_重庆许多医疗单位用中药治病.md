    Many Medical Units in Chongqing Use Traditional Chinese Medicine to Treat Diseases
    More than 100 units in Chongqing, including most municipal hospitals, factory and mining medical institutions, and joint clinics, have adopted many traditional Chinese medicines to treat diseases this year.
    The Chongqing First Workers' Hospital frequently uses 32 kinds of traditional Chinese medicines. Among them, cough syrup is used to treat acute and chronic bronchitis and bronchial asthma; garlic syrup is used to treat infantile pertussis. Because of its good effect, it has been listed as a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine in this hospital. The hospital uses Mudan Mixture to treat women's menstrual diseases and postpartum abdominal pain, poor uterine contraction and other diseases, with a cure rate of over 90%. Xianglian pills (ancient prescription), which only began to be used in September this year, have been very effective in treating 29 cases of early bacillary dysentery and acute and chronic gastroenteritis. The Chongqing Branch of the Red Cross Society of China also uses more than 20 kinds of traditional Chinese medicines. The pediatrics department of this hospital uses Coptis chinensis powder to treat infantile diarrhea, and the outpatient effective rate is also very high; Yinqiao Mixture was used to treat 300 patients with upper respiratory tract infections and colds, and 265 people recovered or alleviated their condition.
    This year, the Chongqing Municipal Company of China National Pharmaceutical Corporation has begun to sell traditional Chinese medicine preparations. Chongqing Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory has also begun to produce a large number of traditional Chinese medicine preparations to meet the needs of various drug-using units.

    重庆许多医疗单位用中药治病
    重庆大部分市立医院、厂矿医疗机构和联合诊所等一百多个单位，今年已采用许多中药治疗疾病。
    重庆市第一工人医院经常采用的中药有三十二种。其中止咳糖浆治疗急性和慢性枝气管炎、枝气管喘息；大蒜糖浆治疗小儿百日咳，因为效果较好，已列为这个医院的常用中药。这个医院用牡丹合剂治疗妇女月经病和产后腹痛、子宫收缩不良等病，治愈率达到百分之九十以上。今年九月才开始使用的香连丸（古方），治疗的二十九个初期杆菌性痢疾和急性、慢性胃肠炎，效果都很好。中国红十字会医院重庆市分院也采用了二十多种中药。这个医院的小儿科用黄连粉治疗小儿腹泻，门诊的有效率也很高；用银翘合剂治疗三百个患上呼吸道感染和患感冒的病人，有二百六十五人痊愈或减轻了病情。
    今年，中国医药公司重庆市公司已开始销售中药制剂。重庆西南制药厂也开始生产大量的中药制剂供应各用药单位需要。　（新华社）
