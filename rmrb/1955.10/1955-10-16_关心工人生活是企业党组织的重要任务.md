    Caring for Workers' Lives is an Important Task of Enterprise Party Organizations
    Zhang Dai
    Not long ago, the Party Committee of the Fushun No. 1 Petroleum Factory conducted a survey in the Gebu Street employee family dormitory. The survey revealed many serious problems in the lives of the employees, which deserve attention.
    Some employees have high incomes, but due to a lack of planning in their lives, they waste and squander their money after receiving their salaries. As a result, some have to borrow money everywhere. A few workers are also eroded by the ideas of the exploiting classes, saving money through frugality and using their savings for usury and business. There is also a portion of employees who have recently joined the factory, have lower technical and professional skills, and have lower incomes, who need to be subsidized and given relief. A small number of workers also fail to properly handle love and marriage issues, and family relationships are not harmonious enough; cases of abuse of parents, wives, and children still occur constantly. The Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions also investigated the situation of some employee collective dormitories. The management of these dormitories is chaotic, and there is a lack of proper recreational activities. As a result, many employees have very unhealthy after-work lives. Some workers have nothing to do when they return to their dormitories after work, so they read absurd and obscene novels, talk about gods and ghosts, and talk until late at night. Some employees are still dancing late at night, which affects production and health. A few employees even engage in undesirable behaviors such as theft and gambling. What particularly needs to be pointed out is that in some employee dormitories, counter-revolutionaries and bad elements have been found to lure workers into various improper activities.
    This situation must be taken seriously. These unhealthy and abnormal phenomena reflect, of course, that bourgeois ideology is still eroding our working class at all times. It also reflects that the Party organizations and trade union organizations in enterprises only pay attention to educating workers to treat production with a socialist labor attitude, while neglecting to care about the lives of the masses and not paying attention to educating workers to handle their personal lives with socialist principles. In other words, in an important aspect—life—the enterprise Party organization has relaxed its connection with the masses, that is, it has relaxed its political and ideological leadership over the masses.
    The Party Committee of the Petroleum No. 1 Factory and the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions have begun to pay attention to these issues, which is a step forward. After investigating the living conditions of employees in the Gebu Street residential area, the Party Committee of the Petroleum No. 1 Factory has already reviewed the bureaucratic work style of the Party Committee and the one-sidedness of political and ideological work—only paying attention to political and ideological work in production, while neglecting political and ideological work in workers' lives—and other shortcomings. The Party Committee of the Petroleum No. 1 Factory has begun to pay attention to solving various problems in the lives of employees and their families. However, not caring about the lives of the masses is not an isolated problem in individual factories and mines, but a common problem in the current work of enterprise Party organizations.
    The situation of mass political work in many enterprise Party organizations is as follows: they manage the inside of the factory but not the outside; Party workers only pay attention to political and ideological work in production, and do not care about the lives of the masses. Party workers rarely visit worker dormitories after work, talk to the workers and even their families, and see what unresolved problems they have. Many Party organizations do not earnestly supervise the administration to correctly use enterprise bonus funds, and do not help the trade union to solve the difficulties in the lives of employees in a timely manner. The use of enterprise bonus funds in some construction enterprises in Beijing is very unreasonable. Some units mistakenly use bonus funds to purchase luxury consumer goods such as cars and cameras, which are only for the enjoyment of a few leaders, but do not pay attention to holding collective welfare undertakings for employees, and do not relieve workers with special difficulties in life. And the Party organizations of these units have relaxed their inspection and supervision of this unreasonable practice. In the end, the Party Committee of Beijing Construction Enterprises inspected and exposed these problems. On the one hand, a large amount of bonus funds or subsidies are accumulated, while on the other hand, a few employees with special difficulties cannot get help, and many problems related to the lives of the masses that do not cost too much money cannot be solved. This phenomenon is quite common.
    These Party organizations that are indifferent to the lives of the masses or do not care enough do not think that this is a serious shortcoming in the work of the Party. Some people believe that since "political work should be combined with economic work," and since "political work should permeate economic activities," the Party organization should focus on solving ideological problems that are directly reflected in production, and should not spend a lot of effort to pay attention to those trivial matters in life. Although some people also see that there are many problems in the lives of employees, they shout: "I can't even carry the burden of central work now, let alone take care of other things." "Factory affairs are busy enough, how can I have time to take care of the dormitories?" In fact, these reasons are untenable. "Political work should be combined with economic work," and "political work should permeate economic activities" is completely correct, but this cannot lead to the conclusion that the Party organization can ignore the lives of employees and the ideological situation outside of production. It is inconceivable that a worker can simultaneously treat life with exploiting ideas and treat production and public interests with a socialist labor attitude. If a young employee is addicted to absurd and bizarre books and publications, and if he treats love and marriage with bourgeois ideas, it will be difficult for him to become a vigorous and fearless shock worker in production. An ordinary worker, when his life encounters major difficulties and he is unable to solve them himself, it will be difficult for him to concentrate on doing a good job in production. Moreover, if a worker is attacked in life by counter-revolutionaries and a gap is opened, it is difficult to ensure that he will not become a prisoner of the enemy in politics. Therefore, it is very obvious that if we only pay attention to ideological problems in production and do not comprehensively care about the lives and thoughts of the masses, it will be impossible to ensure that economic work can proceed smoothly, let alone gradually improve the class consciousness and ideological level of the working class, and ensure the political purity and strength of our working class ranks.
    The work of Party organizations in factories and mines is indeed very busy. However, it is absolutely impossible to not care about the lives of the masses just because we are busy. The question is how the Party organization views this matter. If it is considered an important task of the Party organization, it will naturally be placed in an appropriate position in the work of the Party organization; if these are regarded as "trivial matters in life," it will naturally be "too busy to take care of them." In fact, what some factory and mine Party organizations are now "busy" with is not necessarily all major issues. Many Party organizations still take on a lot of administrative affairs, and some Party committee secretaries feel annoyed when they see workers coming to the Party committee to talk about life issues, and they think that these trivial matters affect their consideration of "major issues." If the Party committee corrects this incorrect view and at the same time arranges the work better, and tries to get rid of those administrative affairs as much as possible, there will be time to care about the lives of the masses.
    Enterprise Party organizations should regard caring for the lives of the masses as an important political task. Comrade Mao Zedong, in his article "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," repeatedly taught us to care for the lives of the masses without the slightest negligence. He pointed out: "All practical problems in the lives of the masses are problems that we should pay attention to. If we pay attention to these problems, solve them, and meet the needs of the masses, we will truly become the organizers of the lives of the masses, and the masses will truly rally around us and enthusiastically support us." "All these problems in the lives of the masses should be put on our agenda. We should discuss, decide, implement, and check them. We must make the broad masses realize that we represent their interests and that we are breathing the same air as them. We must make them understand the higher tasks we have put forward from these things...". The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1946 on "the work of the Party committees of the Ivanovo Textile Joint Factory, the Glukhov Cotton Cloth Joint Factory, and the Tashkent Textile Joint Factory" pointed out: "The administrative leaders of the joint factory are indifferent to the material living facilities of the workers, especially the female workers. The collective dormitories are very unsanitary; some dormitories do not have hot water, the washbasins are not easy to use, and the stoves for cooking are broken. The workers' housing has not been repaired for several years, the roof leaks, but the funds that should be used to repair collective dormitories and housing have not been used at all. The workers' legitimate dissatisfaction with the collective dormitories and canteens has not attracted attention. The Party committee does not check the work of the staff responsible for the living and welfare facilities of the workers enough, and does not consider that without eliminating these serious shortcomings, it will not be possible to ensure the normal work of the enterprise." Therefore, enterprise Party organizations should always care about the personal problems of workers such as food, clothing, housing, transportation, disease, hygiene, love, marriage, family life, and social life, help them overcome difficulties, and educate them to learn to arrange and handle their lives correctly according to socialist moral standards. At the same time, by solving various large and small life problems, we should conduct vivid political and ideological work for the workers, and constantly improve the class consciousness and ideological level of the workers. We must make the political and ideological work of the Party organization not only permeate economic work, but also permeate the daily life of the workers. In this way, the broad masses of workers will inevitably be more concerned about and cherish the cause of the Party and the state, and further improve their production enthusiasm and creativity.
    To care for the lives of the masses, we must also change the work style of the Party organization and strengthen the connection between the Party organization and the broad masses. At present, in many enterprise Party organizations, only a few full-time workers who are divorced from production are doing the work of the Party. The Party committee has not paid attention to organizing and mobilizing all Party members and activists to do the work of the Party. Many Party members actively take the lead in production and play a great role, but after getting off work and returning to the dormitory, they do not know how to play the role of Party members. They do not understand that they should also care about the lives of the masses and should oppose the influence of bourgeois ideology in the lives of the masses. This is precisely the result of the Party organization's failure to educate Party members and care about the lives of the masses. The Party organization should make great efforts to change this situation. Caring for the lives of the masses should become the regular work of all Party members, otherwise, the so-called caring for the lives of the masses will still be empty talk that does not help in practice. Full-time Party workers should not only pay attention to organizing all Party members to strengthen their connection with the masses, but also change their bureaucratic style of being divorced from the masses. While requiring the masses to complete the tasks put forward by the Party, they must understand the requirements and difficulties of the masses and help them solve various pressing problems as much as possible. This requires Party workers to be able to go deep into the masses and talk to the masses, rather than just staying in the room all day to hold meetings or just holding large meetings to assign this and that task to the masses.
    Enterprise Party organizations should also strengthen the leadership of the work of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, and strengthen the supervision of the work of the administrative departments responsible for life and welfare, and constantly urge and help them to take various active measures to continuously improve and improve the lives of workers with the development of the production cause. At present, the work of the life and welfare departments in enterprises is very weak, the staff lacks a mass viewpoint, and there are many problems in ideological style. The Party organization should change the past situation of not asking about or rarely asking about the work of these departments, otherwise, many specific problems in the lives of employees will not be easily solved.

    关心工人生活是企业党组织的重要任务
    张岱
    不久以前，抚顺石油一厂党委会在葛布街职工家属宿舍中进行了一次调查。在这次调查中发现职工生活中有着很多严重的问题，值得引起注意。
    有些职工收入虽然很多，但是因为生活无计划，发工资后就浪费挥霍，结果有的人就不得不到处借贷。还有少数工人受了剥削阶级思想的侵蚀，平时省吃俭用，把积蓄下来的钱用于放高利贷、做买卖等。也还有一部分进厂不久、技术业务水平较低、收入较少的职工，需要给予补助和救济。还有少数工人不能正确地处理恋爱、婚姻问题，家庭关系不够和睦，虐待父母、妻子、儿女的情况都还不断发生。沈阳市工会联合会也曾调查过一部分职工集体宿舍的情况，这些宿舍的管理混乱、缺乏正当的文娱活动，因之，不少职工业余生活很不健康，有些工人下班回宿舍没事，就看那些荒诞诲淫的小说，谈神讲怪，一直谈到深夜。有些职工深夜还在跳舞，因而影响了生产和健康。个别职工甚至有盗窃、赌博等不良行为。特别需要提出的是，在有些职工宿舍中，曾发现有反革命分子、坏分子来引诱工人从事各种不正当的活动。
    这种情况必须引起我们的严重注意。这些不健康不正常的现象当然反映了资产阶级思想还在时时刻刻侵蚀着我们的工人阶级，同时也反映了企业中的党组织和工会组织，只注意教育工人用社会主义的劳动态度来对待生产，而不关心群众生活、不注意教育工人用社会主义的原则来处理个人生活，也就是说，在一个重要方面——生活方面，企业党组织放松了同群众的联系，也就是放松了对群众的政治思想领导。
    石油一厂的党委会和沈阳市工会联合会开始注意这些方面的问题，这是一个进步。石油一厂党委会在调查了葛布街住宅区职工生活的状况后，已经对党委会的官僚主义作风和政治思想工作的片面性——只注意了生产中的政治思想工作，忽视了工人生活中的政治思想工作——等缺点作了检讨。石油一厂党委会已经开始注意解决职工以及家属生活中的各种问题。但是，不关心群众生活并不是个别厂矿的问题，而是目前企业党组织工作中一个带有普遍性的问题。
    有不少企业党组织的群众政治工作状况是：管厂内不管厂外，党工作人员只注意生产中的政治思想工作，而不关心群众生活。党工作人员很少在下班后到工人宿舍中看看，同工人群众以至他们的家属谈谈心，看看他们有些什么不好解决的问题。不少党组织不认真监督行政正确地使用企业奖励基金，不帮助工会及时地解决职工生活中的困难。北京市有些建筑企业单位使用企业奖励基金的情况很不合理。有些单位错误地用奖励基金去购买小汽车、照像机等只供少数领导人员享受的高级消费品，却不注意举办职工集体福利事业，不救济生活上有特殊困难的工人。而这些单位的党组织却对这种不合理的做法放松了检查监督，最后还是北京市建筑企业党委检查揭发了这些问题。一面大量积压奖励基金或补助费，一面少数有特殊困难的职工又得不到帮助，许多并不要花太多钱就可以解决的有关群众生活的问题也得不到解决，这种现象是相当普遍的。
    这些对群众生活漠不关心或关心不够的党组织却并不认为这是党的工作中的一个严重缺点。有些人认为既然要“政治工作同经济工作相结合”，既然要使“政治工作渗透到经济活动中去”，党组织就应该集中解决直接反映在生产中的思想问题，而不必再花很多力量去注意那些生活小事。有些人虽然也看到职工生活中有不少问题，但是他们又这样喊叫着：“我现在连中心工作的担子都挑不动，更顾不到其他了。”“工厂的事就够忙了，那有时间顾宿舍”。事实上，这些理由是都不能成立的。“政治工作同经济工作相结合”，“政治工作应该渗透到经济活动中去”，这是完全正确的，但不能因此得出一个结论，说党组织可以不关心职工的生活和生产以外的思想情况。不能设想，一个工人同时可以用剥削思想来对待生活，而用社会主义的劳动态度来对待生产对待公共利益。一个青年职工如果沉溺于荒唐怪诞的书刊，如果用资产阶级思想对待恋爱和婚姻问题，他就很难成为朝气勃勃不畏困难的生产中的突击手。一个普通工人，当他的生活碰到重大的困难而自己又无力解决时，他就很难专心一意地搞好生产。而且，一个工人如果在生活方面被反革命分子打开了进攻的缺口，就很难保证他在政治上不变成敌人的俘虏。因此，很明显地，如果我们只是注意生产中的思想问题，而不全面地关心群众的生活和思想，就不可能保证经济工作能够顺利进行，更不可能逐步地提高工人阶级的阶级觉悟和思想水平，并保证我们工人阶级队伍在政治上的纯洁和坚强。
    工矿党组织的工作的确是很繁忙的。但是，决不能因为忙就可以不关心群众生活。问题还在于党组织对这件事情怎样看法，如果认为这是党组织的一项重要任务，自然就会把它安排在党组织工作的一个适当的位置上；如果把这些当做“生活小事”，自然就会“无暇顾及”。事实上，现在有些工矿党组织所“忙”的并不一定都是重大问题，很多党组织还是包揽了很多行政事务工作，而且看到工人来到党委会谈有关生活的问题，有的党委书记就感到厌烦，就认为这些小事影响了他们考虑“重大问题”。如果党委会纠正了这种不正确的看法，同时更好地安排一下工作，尽可能地摆脱那些行政事务工作，不会没有时间去关心群众生活。
    企业党组织应该把关心群众生活当成自己的一项重要的政治任务。毛泽东同志在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文中，曾反复地教导我们要一点也不疏忽地关心群众生活，他指出：“一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。假如我们对这些问题注意了，解决了，满足了群众的需要，我们就真正成了群众生活的组织者，群众就会真正围绕在我们的周围，热烈地拥护我们。”“一切这些群众生活上的问题，都应该把它提到自己的议事日程上。应该讨论，应该决定，应该实行，应该检查。要使广大群众认识我们是代表他们的利益的，是和他们呼吸相通的。要使他们从这些事情出发，了解我们提出来的更高的任务……”。一九四六年苏联共产党中央“关于伊万诺夫纺织联合厂、格鲁霍夫棉布联合厂、塔什干纺织联合厂的党委会工作”的决议中指出：“联合厂的行政领导者对工人，特别是对女工的物质生活设施漠不关心。集体宿舍很不卫生；有些宿舍没有热水，洗脸盆不好用，做饭的炉子坏了。工人的住房几年没有修理，屋顶漏，而应当用于修理集体宿舍和住宅的经费竟分文未动。工人对于集体宿舍和食堂的正当的不满，没有引起注意。党委会对负责工人生活福利设施的工作人员的工作，检查得不够，没有考虑到：不消除这些严重的缺点，便无法保证企业的正常工作。”因此，企业党组织对于工人的衣食住行、疾病卫生、恋爱婚姻、家庭生活、社会生活等切身问题都要时刻关怀，帮助他们克服困难，教育他们学会用社会主义的道德标准正确地安排、处理自己的生活。同时，通过解决各种大大小小的生活问题，向工人进行生动的政治思想工作，不断地提高工人的阶级觉悟和思想水平。要使党组织的政治思想工作不仅渗透到经济工作中去，而且要渗透到工人的日常生活中去，这样，就必然会使广大工人群众更加关心和爱护党和国家的事业，更加提高自己的生产积极性和创造性。
    要关心群众生活，还必须改变党组织的工作作风，密切党组织同广大群众的联系。目前，有不少企业党组织只是少数脱离生产的专职工作人员在做党的工作，党委会没有注意组织和动员全体党员以及积极分子都来做党的工作。有不少党员，在生产中积极带头，发挥了很大的作用，但是下班以后回到宿舍就不懂得怎样发挥党员的作用。他们不懂得自己还应该关心群众生活，应该反对资产阶级思想在群众生活中的影响。这正是党组织平时不教育党员、不关心群众生活的结果。党组织应该用很大的努力来改变这种情况。应该使关心群众生活变成全体党员的经常的工作，否则，所谓关心群众生活就还是无补于实际的空谈。专职的党工作人员不但应该注意组织全体党员来加强同群众的联系，同时必须改变自己那种脱离群众的官僚主义作风，在要求群众完成党所提出的任务的同时了解群众的要求和困难，尽可能地帮助他们解决各种迫切需要解决的问题。这就要求党工作人员能够经常地深入群众，同群众谈心，而不要只是整天关在屋子里开会或者只是开大会向群众布置这样那样的任务。
    企业党组织还应当加强对工会、青年团工作的领导，并加强对负责生活福利的行政部门的工作的监督，不断地督促帮助他们采取各种积极措施，使工人的生活随着生产事业的发展得到不断地提高和改善。目前，企业中生活福利部门的工作非常薄弱，工作人员缺乏群众观点，思想作风方面问题较多，党组织应该改变过去不过问或很少过问这些部门工作的状况，否则职工生活中的很多具体问题就不容易得到解决。
