    Purchase and Sale Combination, Fair and Reasonable
    ——The Experience of "Three Fixes" to Households in Hanzhuang Township, Tangyin County
  　Zhou Benyi
    The pilot work of grain "Three Fixes" to households in Hanzhuang Township, Tangyin County, Henan Province, was completed in late June. There are a total of 501 households in Hanzhuang Township. This year's grain unified purchase task is 116,000 jin, a decrease of 27.5% compared to last year; the grain unified sales target is 63,125 jin, a decrease of 49.1% compared to last year. After offsetting purchases and sales, the state purchased 17,488 jin more grain than last year. Because the principle of combining purchase and sale was earnestly implemented in the "Three Fixes" work, the false phenomena in grain purchase and sale were eliminated, and the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of farmers was raised. After the summer harvest, the farmers sold their surplus grain to the state with great enthusiasm. More than 80 households (accounting for about 27% of the unified purchase households) in the township over-sold more than 21,000 jin of surplus grain.
    Before the start of the "Three Fixes" work, many Party members and staff in Hanzhuang Township did not fully understand the important significance of grain "Three Fixes," and attempted to simply reduce the amount of political work in grain work. Yan Chang, a Party member in Beizhangjia Village, said: "With policies, set them according to the policies, and let it be what it will be." Many staff members, after determining production and purchase, were unwilling to conduct household-by-household review and verification work for surplus grain households and grain-deficient households. Party member Zhang Chongde said: "In any case, unified sales are easier than unified purchase. Unified sales do not require as much persuasion as unified purchase." Some staff members said: It can be completed by calculating the accounts. These erroneous ideas hindered the progress of the "Three Fixes" to household work. Therefore, when the township branch conducted education for Party members and staff, it focused on summarizing the lessons learned from last year's emphasis on purchase and neglect of sales. Last year, because many staff members neglected to conduct household-by-household review and verification, the boundary between surplus grain and grain deficiency was not clear, which brought serious damage to the unified purchase and sales work. For example, 13 members of the Dengta Agricultural Production Cooperative sold "excessive grain"; at the same time, more than 40 individual farmers in the township sold nearly 10,000 jin less grain. In terms of unified sales, the township over-supplied more than 10,000 jin of grain to more than 90 farmers; at the same time, more than a dozen real grain-deficient households did not buy enough rations. By this spring, those who were not short of grain also said "short of grain." In Beizhangjia Village alone, more than 80 households said they had no grain to eat. More than 30 members of agricultural cooperatives in the township also requested to withdraw from the cooperative on the grounds that "the cooperative is tight, and eating grain is not as free as outside the cooperative." After recalling and improving understanding, Party members and staff realized that if the unified grain purchase and sales work is not done well, it will not only affect the relationship between the Party and the farmers, but also affect the development of the agricultural cooperation movement. Party member Zhang Shouyi said: "I used to think that this year, according to the fixed output, the purchase will be calculated, and the grain-deficient households will be supplied by the state, so it is enough to fix the output. However, after carefully recalling that last year's careless work had caused the consequences of less state purchase and more sales and public dissatisfaction, this year we must carefully do a good job in combining purchase and sales."
    On the basis of correcting the understanding of Party members and staff on the unified grain purchase and sales work, it is also necessary to clarify the specific contents and practices of the grain "Three Fixes." Among them, it is particularly important to draw a clear line between surplus grain and grain deficiency. When carrying out this work, the township branch and the township grain committee paid special attention to strengthening the ideological leadership and technical supervision of the accounting staff, and promptly correcting the crude practices of "rounding off, ignoring fractions, and discarding odds and ends" in the accounting. First, let the accounting staff clarify two situations: one is the planting area of ​​summer and autumn crops, and the other is the number of people and livestock that must be deducted from the actual number of tax-exempt points for each household. In the first two preliminary investigations in the township, the villages underreported 180 mu of wheat land and overreported 110 mu of vegetable land; 31 households reported people who were away as being at home, overreporting 36 people and 12 livestock. After the third review, the situation was finally clarified and these untrue parts were corrected. Secondly, Hanzhuang Township also paid attention to the calculation of the proportion of summer and autumn grain purchases. This year, the proportion of surplus grain households' summer and autumn grain sales is determined according to the total area of ​​summer and autumn crops. This practice is more reasonable than last year's practice of unified purchase according to the rate of each season. For grain-deficient households, it is even more necessary to conduct household-by-household review to clarify the actual number of grain deficiencies in summer and autumn according to the planting area of ​​grain crops in summer and autumn, so as to verify the number of grain-deficient households and the amount of grain deficiency. Beizhangjia Village originally calculated that there were 32 households with grain deficiency in summer, but after household-by-household review, it was found that 6 households were surplus in summer and deficient in autumn, and only 26 households were truly deficient in summer.
    In the process of the Three Fixes, in order to deeply mobilize the masses, the township branch held separate forums for poor peasants and middle peasants, repeatedly publicized the grain "Three Fixes" policy, explained the production method and the purchase and sales methods, and at the same time conducted education on saving grain. Beizhang Village also conducted individual education for grain-deficient farmers. Zhang Wenjing, a grain-deficient farmer in this village, calculated that he should be supplied with 300 jin of grain in summer according to his own grain output, but he helped his relatives to farm and distributed 100 jin of grain, but he concealed it and said that he must be supplied with 300 jin of grain. Zhang Fengshan, the township head, learned during the conversation with him that his concern was that he was afraid of reducing the number of heads in the assessment and that the supply would not be timely, which would affect family life. Zhang Fengshan explained the policy to him in response to this idea. Finally, he said that he should report the number of grain shortages truthfully. He calculated an account: "I distributed 100 jin of grain to people who farmed for me, and my wheat field also overproduced about 30 jin. If I pay attention to saving, it is enough to supply 140 or 150 jin of grain in summer." After such in-depth investigation and ideological education, according to the population size, living habits, and actual grain harvest in summer of each grain-deficient household, a sales assessment plan was made according to household categories, and the fixed sales figures were initially verified to households.
    The result of implementing the policy of fixed production and fixed purchase for three years has indeed encouraged the production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers; however, some grain-deficient farmers (mostly poor peasants and cotton farmers) are still afraid that the unified sales volume is too low, and that the seasonal sales assessment and phased supply are not timely. Therefore, it is necessary to let grain-deficient farmers know that one-time accounting and seasonal sales assessment are to make grain supply more in line with the actual needs of grain-deficient households, to eliminate false phenomena in unified sales, and to reduce the waste of state grain. At the same time, it is also necessary to educate grain-deficient farmers to arrange housework in a planned way, be careful and economical, save grain, say how much is lacking, do not falsely report the amount of grain shortage, and do not buy more state grain. When grain-deficient farmers understand the benefits of the fixed sales method to them, their concerns are eliminated. Zhang Fude, a poor peasant in Beizhangjia Village, said: "It is said that I should be supplied with 180 jin of grain throughout the year, and 80 jin of grain in the wheat season. My family has eight people, and four of them are children who eat less. If I save a little, I can do without supply in the wheat season. Save the money for buying these grains to buy one hundred and ten kilograms of fertilizer, and plant three or four mu of land, each mu of land can increase production by at least 20 to 30 kilograms."
    On the basis of thoroughly implementing the policy, the branch once again reviewed the purchase and sales plan of the Grain Committee household by household, and then submitted the plan to the township People's Congress meeting for review. After the purchase and sales figures of each household were determined, a meeting of activists was held to discuss the purchase and sales plan passed by the township People's Congress meeting, and finally a meeting of all farmers was held to announce the plan to the masses and mobilize everyone to review it, and finally revise it according to the opinions of the masses. During the process of mass review and evaluation, everyone put forward many opinions, which were of great help to the "Three Fixes" work. For example, in the layer-by-layer review in Beizhang Village, it was found that one household did not calculate the fixed sales figures due to miscounting the population, one household did not sell the summer sales due to miscalculating the wheat field area, and two households of lonely elderly people were not taken care of. These were all corrected according to the opinions of the masses. After repeated review from top to bottom and from bottom to top, both the surplus grain households and the grain-deficient households were very satisfied. They generally believed that: after democratic discussion by everyone, the determination was reasonable, the purchase was practical, and the sales were fair; unlike last year, only a few staff members drew circles, and finally whoever was told to sell how much had to sell how much, and how much was supplied to whom was how much. Their conclusion was: this year's work method is good, and the staff's work style is also upright. After the "Three Fixes", 90% of the surplus grain farmers in the township purchased 120,000 jin of chemical fertilizer and cake fertilizer with the money from selling surplus grain and applied it to autumn fields. Those thirty-odd members who requested to withdraw from the cooperative in the spring no longer requested to withdraw from the cooperative; more than eighty farmers requested to join the cooperative. According to this new situation, the township branch committee is preparing to vigorously develop agricultural cooperatives after autumn.

    购销结合，公平合理
    ——汤阴县韩庄乡“三定”到户工作经过
  　周本义
    河南省汤阴县韩庄乡的粮食“三定”到户的试点工作，是在六月下旬完成的。韩庄乡全乡共有五百零一户。今年粮食统购任务是十一万六千斤，比去年减少百分之二十七点五；粮食统销指标是六万三千一百二十五斤，比去年减少百分之四十九点一。购销相抵，国家比去年多购了一万七千四百八十八斤粮食。由于在“三定”工作中认真地贯彻了购销结合的原则，消除了粮食购销中的虚假现象，提高了广大农民的社会主义觉悟。夏收以后，农民们以高度的热情把余粮卖给国家，全乡有八十多户农民（占统购户的百分之二十七左右）超额售出了余粮二万一千多斤。
    在“三定”工作开始前，韩庄乡的许多党员和工作人员对粮食“三定”的重要意义认识不足，企图简单从事，减少粮食工作中的政治工作的份量。北张贾村党员阎锠说：“有了政策，按政策定，定到那儿算那儿。”很多工作人员在定产、定购之后，不愿意对余粮户和缺粮户逐户地进行审查核实工作。党员张崇得说：“咋说统销也比统购省劲，搞统销不用像搞统购那样费唇舌了。”有的工作人员说：算算账就可以完成了。这些错误思想妨碍“三定”到户工作的进行。因此，乡支部在向党员和工作人员进行教育时，着重总结了去年重购轻销的教训。去年，由于有不少工作人员忽视逐户进行审查核实，结果余粮和缺粮的界限划不清，给统购统销工作带来了严重的损害。例如灯塔农业生产合作社中有十三户社员卖了“过头粮”；而同时，全乡又有四十多户个体农民少卖了将近一万斤粮食。在统销方面，全乡向九十多户农民多供应了一万多斤粮食；同时又有十来户真正的缺粮户没有买到足够的口粮。到了今年春天，那些不缺粮的人也说“缺粮”，光是北张贾一个村就有八十多户说没有粮食吃。全乡还有三十多户农业合作社员也以“社里扣得紧，吃粮食没有社外自由”为理由，要求退社。通过回忆，提高认识以后，党员和工作人员体会到，搞不好粮食统购统销工作，不仅影响党同农民的关系，而且影响农业合作化事业的发展。党员张守义说：“以前我认为今年按定产计购，缺粮户由国家供应，只要定好产就行了。可是仔细回想起去年马虎从事的作法曾经造成国家少购多销、群众不满的后果，今年一定要慎重搞好购销结合工作才行。”
    在端正党员和工作人员对粮食统购统销工作的认识的基础上，还要把粮食“三定”的各项具体内容和作法交代清楚。其中，划清余粮缺粮界限，尤为重要。在进行这一工作时，乡支部和乡粮食委员会特别注意加强对计购员的思想领导和技术监督工作，及时纠正计购中那种“四舍五入、分厘不计、丢零舍尾”的粗糙作法。首先，让计购员澄清两个情况：一个是夏秋两季作物的播种面积，一个是各户实有的必须扣除免购点的人口和扣除饲料的牲畜数字。全乡前两次初步调查时，各村少报麦地一百八十亩，多报菜地一百一十亩；有三十一户把在外人口报成在家人口，多报人口三十六人，多报牲口十二头。经过第三次审查，才最后弄清了情况，订正了这些不实的部分。其次，韩庄乡还注意了夏秋购粮比例的计算。今年是按夏秋季作物的总面积确定余粮户夏秋粮食交售比例的，这个作法比去年的分季依率统购的作法更为合理。对于缺粮户，更必须逐户进行审查，根据缺粮户夏秋粮食作物的播种面积，弄清夏秋两季实际缺粮数字，以便核实缺粮户数和缺粮数量。北张贾村原来计算夏季有缺粮的有三十二户，但经逐户审查后发现其中有六户是夏余秋缺，夏季真正缺粮的只有二十六户。
    在三定过程中，乡支部为了深入发动群众，曾分别召开贫农座谈会，中农座谈会、反复宣传粮食“三定”政策，说明定产方法和计购、计销的方法，同时进行节约粮食的教育。北张村还对缺粮农民个别地进行了教育。这个村的缺粮农民张文景按照自己的粮食产量计算，夏季该供应他三百斤粮食，但是他帮助亲戚种地，分了一百斤粮食，他却隐瞒不谈，说非供应他三百斤粮食不行。乡长张凤山同他谈话时了解到他的顾虑是怕评议中减头去尾，怕供应不及时，影响家庭生活。张凤山针对他这种思想，向他解释政策，最后他表示应该实事求是地报缺粮数字。他算了一个账：“给人家种地分了一百斤粮食，自己的小麦田还超产了三十来斤，再注意节约，夏季供应一百四、五十斤粮食就够吃了。”经过这样深入的调查和思想教育，根据各缺粮户的人口大小、生活习惯、夏季实际收粮数字，按户分类，做出了评销方案，把定销数字初步核定到户。
    贯彻定产、定购三年不变的政策的结果，确实鼓励了广大农民的生产积极性；但是有些缺粮农民（多数是贫农和棉农）还是怕统销量过低，怕分季评销、分期供应不及时。因此，就必须让缺粮农民知道：一次计销、分季评销是为了使粮食供应更加符合缺粮户的实际需要，是为了消灭统销中的虚假现象，减少国家粮食的浪费。同时也必须教育缺粮农民有计划地安排家务，精打细算，节约粮食，缺多少，说多少，不虚报缺粮数，不多买国家的粮食。当缺粮农民理解到定销办法对他们的好处后，他们的顾虑就消除了。北张贾村贫农张福德说：“按说全年该供应我一百八十斤粮食，麦季供应我八十斤粮食。我家八口人，有四个小孩，吃的较少，稍节约一点，麦季就可以不要供应了。把买这些粮食的钱省下用来买百十斤肥料，上三、四亩地，每亩地至少能增产二、三十斤。”
    在深入贯彻政策的基础上，支部再一次逐户审查了粮食委员会的购销方案，然后再把这个方案交乡人民代表大会会议复核。各户购销数字确定后，再召开积极分子会议，讨论乡人民代表大会会议通过的购销方案，最后召开全体农民会议，向群众公布这个方案，并发动大家审查，最后再根据群众的意见，加以修正。在群众审查评议过程中，大家提出了不少意见，对“三定”工作有很大帮助。例如北张村在层层审查中，发现因错计人口未计定销数字者一户，因错算麦地面积夏季应销未销的一户，孤寡户没有得到照顾者二户，这些，都根据群众的意见，做了订正。经过自上而下和自下而上的反复审核后，余粮户和缺粮户都很满意，普遍认为：经大家民主讨论，定得合理，购得实际，销得公道；不像去年只由几个工作人员划划圈圈，最后叫谁卖多少就得卖多少，供应给谁多少就是多少。他们得出的结论是：今年是工作办法好，工作人员作风也正派了。在“三定”以后，全乡余粮农民把百分之九十的出售余粮的款购买了十二万斤化学肥料和饼肥施在秋田上。春季要求退社的那三十多户社员再也不要求退社了；还有八十多户农民要求入社。乡支部委员会根据这一新的情况，准备在秋后大力发展农业合作社。
