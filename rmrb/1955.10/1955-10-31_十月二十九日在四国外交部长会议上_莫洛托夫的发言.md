Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, October 30th:

    The Soviet delegation has taken note of some of the speeches made today and yesterday. We feel it is our duty to respond to yesterday's speeches. Of course, we must also address our remarks to the speeches made here today.

    Mr. Dulles’s analysis of the directives of the Four-Power Heads of Government in his speech today was somewhat unexpected. I would like to address this speech first.

    Mr. Dulles’s speech had a certain legalistic nature, that is, a legal analysis of the instructions given to us by the heads of government. However, I believe that in conducting a legal analysis of an issue, both the form and content of the issue are important.

    We also hope that the statements made here will take into account what the Soviet delegation specifically pointed out in its statement. In fact, when we presented our proposals yesterday, we stated that they concerned the issue of European security and that we intended to present our proposals on the German question in the future. Given this, can it be demanded of us that we must address both issues in our proposals? Is it against the interests of the matter if we discuss one issue in one document and another issue related to the same agenda item in another document? We believe that, even from the most correct legal point of view, there is no contradiction or impropriety on our part here.

    We have been told that the Four-Power Heads of Government’s directives state that there should be a close link between the reunification of Germany and the issue of European security. We do not object to this, and it is precisely for this reason that we all agreed to discuss both the European security issue and the German question when discussing the first item on the agenda. We have agreed that this correctly reflects the directives of the Four-Power Heads of Government.

    Mr. Dulles likes the draft he has put forward for our discussion. That is his right. But why must we do it in the way that the US Secretary of State considers best? Why can't we do it in the way we consider more appropriate, that is, by separately noting the European security issue and the German question, discussing the European security issue in more detail, and then discussing the German question?

    If we look at the true meaning of the Four-Power Heads of Government's directives, the fact that the first point first mentions the European security issue and then the German question has its significance when the directives were adopted. After we discussed this issue in July, we reached an agreement: first discuss the European security issue, then the German question. Here, we are also based on the order stipulated in the directives. The first part of the first point of the Four-Power Heads of Government's directives talks about European security, so, as correctly pointed out here, our proposals start with the issue of European security.

    The second part of the first point of the Four-Power Heads of Government's directives talks about the German question. We have already declared in advance that we will put forward our own proposals on this issue and believe that: when we discuss the main issue—European security—we are creating favorable prerequisites for discussing the German question, which is a part of European security, that is, the security of European countries, and is subordinate to this main issue.

    As for the German question, we believe that its discussion should also comply with the directives of the Four-Power Heads of Government. And in this directive, it is pointed out that the foreign ministers can involve relevant parties in the discussion of this issue. Has anyone here suggested discussing the German question with the participation of the Germans themselves? No one has raised this question until now. If we are to directly discuss the German question, it is clear that we should first decide whether the representatives of the German people should participate in the discussion of this issue. Yesterday, we said that we were prepared to raise this issue when discussing the German question specifically.

    We have no formal complaints about the draft proposal on the first agenda item submitted by the three foreign ministers. We also believe that there is no basis for raising any complaints about our proposals.

    If we consistently proceed from the implementation of the directives of the Four-Power Heads of Government, then when we start discussing the German question, we should consider the issue of the participation of the representatives of the German people in our discussion. I believe that this is in line with the directives of the Four-Power Heads of Government. But until now, as you can see, no one has raised this issue, because a more detailed discussion of the German question is still in the future. We understand that this is because we are now mainly exchanging views on the issue of European security.

    Mr. Pinay and Mr. Macmillan have criticized our draft on the basic principles of the European collective security system. They say that this draft is outdated. But I want to state that the issue of European collective security has been and still is of interest to the peoples of Europe. We also believe that this issue, as a major issue for ensuring peace and European security, is of interest to us.

    Someone here said that the Soviet delegation's draft on the basic principles of a pan-European treaty on the establishment of a European collective security system was previously proposed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin at the Four-Power Heads of Government meeting. We do not intend to deny this. However, this proposal, like other proposals and opinions on European security issues that were assigned to the ministers for discussion at this meeting, was not discussed at the time.

    When discussing the issue of European security, Mr. Pinay cited France's historical experience. In this regard, he said that the Soviet proposal on collective security seemed like those paper guarantees that had tricked France more than once in the past. I don't think Mr. Pinay was able to prove what he said.

    I would like to present some facts. We agree that France's experience is very illustrative. If we face the facts, then it should be said that France's misfortune, like many other countries in Europe, was due to the unwillingness of its leaders to unite its strength with other major powers—including the Soviet Union—to jointly strike at aggressors preparing to launch a war. These leaders preferred to pursue a policy of establishing blocs, which, as everyone knows, led to World War II. Everyone also knows that it was the Soviet Union that called on European countries to take collective action to maintain peace, just as it now advocates the establishment of collective security.

    Mr. Pinay fervently defended the North Atlantic Group here. We listened with great interest today—as in the past—to the arguments put forward by the French representative in defense of the North Atlantic Group. It should be pointed out here that the Soviet Union's attitude towards the North Atlantic Group has not been described entirely accurately here, and this is not difficult to see if you carefully familiarize yourself with the draft of the pan-European treaty on collective security that we have provided for discussion. At the same time, we have no reason to doubt that the Soviet Union's attitude towards the North Atlantic Group is no secret to you, and we do not need to repeat it.

    Mr. Macmillan once explained with some enthusiasm why, in his opinion, the Soviet Union could not be accepted into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. His reason was that the North Atlantic Group and the Soviet Union pursued different goals.

    We know each other well enough, and we are fully aware that, at least on a major issue for the people of all countries, we have always believed that we have common and consistent goals, which are the goals of defending peace and ensuring the security of our own country and all countries in the world. If our goals on the issue of safeguarding peace are also different, then what are we doing here? Why should we discuss issues such as European security, the German question, disarmament, and the development of contacts between East and West here?

    Mr. Pinay's words can be understood as meaning that the Soviet Union seems unwilling to sincerely cooperate with the United States on the issue of ensuring peace in Europe and on the issue of ensuring European security. I believe that this interpretation has no basis, because we believe that the entire significance of the Geneva Four-Power Heads of Government meeting and the significance of our current meeting lies in the fact that we, the representatives of France, Britain, and the Soviet Union, should work with the representative of the United States to reach an agreement between each other and reach a common understanding on the interests of defending peace and security in Europe and the world. At the same time, we hope that, despite the difficulties, this goal can still be achieved.

    The Soviet delegation asks the French delegation: is it in the interests of European peace and the direct interests of our countries that certain European countries can participate in an organization, participate in a military bloc, and even re-militarized West Germany is no exception, while at the same time it is considered unacceptable for the peace-loving Soviet Union to participate in this organization? Can this prove that such a group is defensive in nature and not directed against the Soviet Union? There is also a question: does this comply with the most basic and undeniable fact that we have all recognized, that we fought bravely against German aggression in the cruel years of war, and that we solemnly promised to take joint measures to work together to prevent German aggression from recurring? This is of course a question to be raised.

    Mr. Dulles said yesterday that the Western military groups, namely the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union, are also "organizations for collective security." He also elaborated on the idea that these groups are a manifestation of the inalienable right of individual and collective self-defense of the people of all countries mentioned in the United Nations Charter. However, it is difficult to agree with this statement. If we proceed from this point of view, we should obviously admit that the Entente and the Triple Alliance before World War I and the Anti-Comintern Pact before World War II were also "organizations for collective security." Everyone knows that the planners of these military groups were constantly making excuses that these groups were established for self-defense. However, we do not believe that any of us would agree to make such an assessment of the aforementioned military groups.

    The United Nations Charter does stipulate the sacred right of the people of all countries to exercise individual and collective self-defense, and the purpose of this defense should be to ensure national security. However, it is a completely different matter if exclusive military groups are established, the spearhead of which is directed at other countries that have been excluded in advance and are not allowed to participate in corresponding agreements and treaties.

    The positive significance of the proposals of the three foreign ministers lies in the fact that it has taken a step forward compared with the Berlin meeting last year. It already talks about European security, while this point was very obscure in the proposals of the three countries at the Berlin meeting. Therefore, we can note with satisfaction that the attitudes of the three countries have become closer to the attitude of the Soviet Union.

    However, if we look carefully at this proposal, we get the impression that the wording on the issue of European security here is very formal. Obviously, this issue has not been given the importance that we believe it should be given.

    Mr. Dulles here mentioned some declarative statements on the issue of European security in the draft of the three foreign ministers. Even such declarative statements may be beneficial. We are not prepared to argue about this. But is it enough to guarantee European security by merely making some declarative statements and mentioning the possibility of consultation?

    While pointing out the positive aspects of the draft of the three foreign ministers, the Soviet delegation also believes that it must be noted its essential shortcomings.

    We believe that the basic shortcoming of the so-called "restoration of German unity and security" draft proposed by the three ministers is that everything in this draft is subordinate to one purpose: to include the whole of Germany, and a rearmed Germany, in the North Atlantic Group. The draft talks about the reunification of Germany, but it is clear that the drafters of the draft are not interested in this issue.

    Someone here has advised us to study the draft of the three ministers more carefully. Of course, we have taken this reasonable advice and moderate attitude into proper consideration. However, the more we study the above draft, the more convinced we are that the proposals put forward in the draft are not in line with the goal of unifying Germany based on the national interests of Germany and the interests of ensuring European security.

    One gets the feeling that the issue of German unity is only of interest to the drafters of the draft if the unified Germany becomes a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (North Atlantic Group). The so-called "special guarantee" treaty on the restoration of German unity will only take effect under this circumstance.

    Mr. Dulles patiently explained to us that if the unified Germany becomes a member of the Warsaw Treaty Organization, then in this case it is not the three Western countries that should make guarantees on the German question. Of course, this explanation is appropriate. However, Mr. Dulles did not talk at all about the question of whether the unified Germany might not want to participate in any groups at all if it could truly freely choose its own path. Neither the draft treaty of the three foreign ministers nor Mr. Dulles, Mr. Macmillan, or Mr. Pinay have provided a convincing explanation of this during our discussions.

    Are we only interested in such a Germany that we have pre-determined must participate in a certain group? Are we only interested in such a Germany that is satisfied with and meets the wishes of the existing groups, rather than a Germany that truly has the freedom to choose its path and become a democratic and peaceful country? We feel that the path of Germany should be decided by the German people themselves, and this is in line with their free will, but we should be concerned with assisting and helping the German people in a timely manner so that the unified Germany becomes a peace-loving and democratic country.

    Then, there is no need to drag Germany into a certain group, so as to more or less restrict the free will of the German people on the issue of reunifying Germany on the basis of peace and democracy.

    All this requires us to reach an agreement, first of all, on the basic issue, on the issue of the security of all European countries. Then, the German question will also occupy its proper place, without worrying that it will be partially resolved. The way to partially resolve the German question with the aim of dragging the unified Germany into a certain group will not gain the sympathy of the European people who strive to consolidate peace and European security.

    I say again, we have made some progress—we all recognize that the issue of European security is of paramount importance to the people of Europe. We should take further measures.

    In fact, if we mainly look at the issue of European security from the perspective of the interests of a certain group of countries, from the perspective of consolidating a certain group of countries in Europe, this narrow view is unlikely to gain the sympathy of the European people.

    Precisely because of this, we must ask: can we all agree that when we discuss security issues here, we are not looking at them from the perspective of consolidating a certain group of countries, but from the perspective of the security interests of all European countries, in any case, from the interests of all those European countries that have suffered deeply from German militarism in the past and are striving not to allow German militarism to revive and not to allow it to launch new aggressions.

    The Soviet delegation requests the participants of the meeting to express their opinions on this issue before we continue our discussions.

### 十月二十九日在四国外交部长会议上  莫洛托夫的发言

专栏：

    十月二十九日在四国外交部长会议上
    莫洛托夫的发言
    苏联代表团注意到今天和昨天的一些发言。我们认为我们有责任回答昨天在这里的发言。当然，我们也必须针对今天这里的发言加以我们的说明。
    杜勒斯先生在今天的发言中对四国政府首脑的指示作了分析，他的发言是有些出乎意料的。我首先想谈谈这个发言。
    杜勒斯先生的发言带有某种程度的法律上的性质，即从法律上来分析政府首脑给我们的指示。但是，我认为，在对问题进行法律上的分析时，无论问题的形式和内容都是重要的。
    我们还希望，在这里的发言中将考虑到苏联代表团在声明中所特别指出的事情。事实上我们在昨天提出自己的建议的时候就说，它涉及的是欧洲安全问题，我们打算在今后提出我们关于德国问题的建议。既然这样，难道还可以提出苛求，似乎我们一定应当在建议中涉及两个问题吗？我们在一个文件上谈到一个问题，而在同议程这一项有关的另一个文件上谈到同这项议程有关的另一个问题，这种作法难道是违反事情的利益的吗？我们认为，甚至从最正确的法律的观点来分析这个问题，我们在这里也没有任何矛盾和任何不正确的地方。
    有人对我们说，四国政府首脑指示中提到德国的重新统一和欧洲安全问题之间应当有一种紧密的联系。我们并不反对这一点，而且正因为如此，我们大家都同意讨论第一项议程时既讨论欧洲安全问题，也讨论德国问题。我们已经一致认为，这就正确地反映了四国政府首脑的指示。
    杜勒斯先生喜欢他提出来给我们讨论的草案。这是他所有的权利。但是为什么我们一定要按照美国国务卿认为最好的方式去做，为什么我们不能照我们认为更加合适的方式去做，也就是分别地注意到欧洲安全问题和德国问题，更详细地讨论欧洲安全问题，然后讨论德国问题呢？
    这里如果从四国政府首脑指示的真正意义看来，指示第一点中先谈到欧洲安全问题然后再谈到德国问题，我认为这点在通过指示的时候是有它的意义的。七月间我们讨论这个问题后已经达成协议：首先谈欧洲安全问题，然后才是德国问题。这里我们也是以指示中规定的次序为根据的。四国政府首脑的指示第一点第一部分谈的是欧洲安全，所以，正如这里所正确指出的，我们的建议也从欧洲安全的问题开始。
    四国政府首脑指示的第一点的第二部分谈到德国问题。我们已经预先声明，对这个问题我们还要提出自己的建议，并且认为：在我们讨论主要问题——欧洲安全问题时，我们就在为讨论德国问题创造良好的前提，德国问题是欧洲安全，即欧洲各国的安全这个主要问题的一部分，是从属于这个主要问题的问题。
    至于德国问题，我们认为，它的讨论也应当符合四国政府首脑指示。而在这个指示中指出，外长们可以吸收有关方面参加这个问题的讨论。在这里有谁提出希望在有德国人自己参加的情况下讨论德国问题这种意见吗？直到现在还没有人提出这个问题。如果我们要直接就讨论德国问题，很明显，我们首先应当决定德国人民的代表是否参加讨论这个问题。昨天我们说，我们准备在具体讨论德国问题时提出这个问题。
    我们对三国外交部长对第一项议程所提出的草案没有任何形式上的苛求。我们也认为，对我们建议提出任何苛求也是没有根据的。
    如果我们始终是从执行四国政府首脑指示出发的话，那末在我们着手讨论德国问题的时候，我们就应当考虑德国人民代表参加我们的讨论的问题。我认为，这是符合四国政府首脑指示的。但是直到现在，大家看，还没有人提出这个问题，因为更仔细地讨论德国问题还在以后。我们懂得：所以如此是因为我们现在主要还在就欧洲安全问题交换意见。
    比内先生和麦克米伦先生在这里对我们关于欧洲集体安全体系的基本原则的草案提出了批评。他们说这个草案是陈旧的。但是我要说明，欧洲集体安全问题过去和现在都是欧洲各国人民所感到兴趣的。我们也认为，这个问题作为保证和平和欧洲安全的一个主要问题，也是我们所感到兴趣的。
    这里有人说，苏联代表团所提出的关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的全欧条约基本原则草案是部长会议主席布尔加宁早些时候在四国政府首脑会议上已经提出过的。我们不打算否认这一点。但是，这个建议也像责成部长们在这次会议上讨论的就欧洲安全问题提出的其他建议和意见一样，在当时没有加以讨论。
    比内先生在谈到欧洲安全问题时，引述了法国的历史经验。他在这方面说，苏联关于集体安全问题的建议似乎就像在过去不止一次地叫法国上当的那些纸上的保证。我认为，比内先生并没有能证实他所说的这一点。
    我想提出一些事实。我们同意，法国的经验很能说明问题。如果正视事实的话，那末应当说，法国过去的不幸，像欧洲的其他许多国家一样，是由于它的领导者不愿意把自己的力量同其他的大国——其中包括苏联——联合在一起，来共同给予准备发动战争的侵略者以打击。这些领导者宁愿执行建立集团的政策，大家知道，这种政策曾经导致了第二次世界大战。大家也知道，正是苏联曾经号召欧洲国家为了维护和平而采取集体行动，就像它现在主张建立集体安全一样。
    比内先生在这里热烈地替北大西洋集团辩护。我们今天很感兴趣地听取了——就像过去一样——法国代表为了替北大西洋集团辩护而提出的那些论据。这里应当指出，苏联对北大西洋集团的态度在这里被叙说得不完全确切，而如果仔细地熟悉一下我们提供大家讨论的关于集体安全的全欧条约基本原则草案的话，这是不难看到的。同时，我们没有理由怀疑，苏联对北大西洋集团的态度对你们并不是什么秘密，我们没有必要重复这一点。
    麦克米伦先生曾经怀着某种热忱说明，据他看来为什么不能接受苏联加入北大西洋公约组织。他的理由是：北大西洋集团和苏联追求着不同的目标。
    我们互相之间是足够了解的，我们完全清楚，至少，在一个对世界各国人民说来都是主要的问题上，我们过去和现在都认为我们是有共同的一致的目标的，这就是保卫和平、保障本国和世界各国的安全的目标。如果我们在保卫和平利益这个问题上的目标也各不相同，那末，我们在这里聚会干什么呢？我们又何必在这里讨论欧洲安全问题、德国问题、裁军问题、发展东西方之间的接触问题这样一些问题呢？
    比内先生的话可以这样理解：苏联似乎不愿意真心诚意地同美国在保障欧洲和平的问题上、在保障欧洲安全的问题上实行合作。我认为，这种解释是没有任何根据的，因为我们认为日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的全部意义和我们这次会议的意义就在于：我们，法国、英国和苏联的代表，应该同美国的代表一道致力取得彼此间的协议，对保卫欧洲和全世界的和平和安全的利益取得共同的谅解。同时我们希望，尽管有困难，还是可以达到这个目标。
    苏联代表团试问法国代表团：某些欧洲国家可以参加一个组织，参加一个军事集团，甚至重新军国主义化的西德也不例外，而同时却认为不能接受爱好和平的苏联参加这个组织，这种情况是否符合欧洲和平的利益和我们这些国家的直接利益呢？这难道能够证明这样一个集团具有防御性质而不是针对着苏联的吗？还有一个问题：这种情况是不是符合我们大家都曾经承认是最起码的、最无可争辩的事实，即在残酷的战争年代中我们曾经奋勇抵抗德国侵略，而且，我们曾经郑重允诺采取共同措施来协力同心地防止德国侵略再起？这是当然要提出来的问题。
    杜勒斯先生昨天说过，西方国家的军事集团，即北大西洋公约组织和西欧联盟，也是“集体安全的组织”。他还发挥了这样的思想：这些集团是联合国宪章中所提到的各国人民的不可剥夺的单独防御和集体防御权利的表现。但是，这种说法是难以同意的。假如从这种观点出发，我们显然就应当承认，第一次世界大战前的协约国和三国同盟以及第二次世界大战前的反共产国际协定也都是一种“集体安全的组织”了。大家知道，这些军事集团的策划者时时刻刻在借口说，这些集团的建立是为了自卫。然而我们并不以为，我们之间有谁会同意对上述的军事集团作这样的估价。
    联合国宪章的确规定了各国人民实行单独防御和集体防御的神圣权利，这种防御的目的应当是保障国家的安全。但是，如果建立的是排他的军事集团，其矛头是指向那些事先被排斥而不得参加相应的协定和条约的其他国家的，那就完全是另外一回事。
    三国外交部长的建议的积极意义在于：它同去年柏林会议的时候相比，已经前进了一步。其中已经谈到欧洲安全，而在柏林会议的三国建议中，这点是很隐晦的。因此，我们可以满意地指出：三国的态度同苏联的态度已经有了接近。
    但是，我们如果仔细看一下这个建议，就会得到这样一个印象：这里对欧洲安全问题的提法是非常形式的。显然，对这个问题并没有给予我们认为应有的重视。
    杜勒斯先生这里提到了三国外长的草案中对欧洲安全问题所作的一些宣言性的声明。即使这样的宣言性的声明也可能是有益的。关于这一点，我们不准备争辩。但是，仅仅作一些宣言性的声明和提一提协商的可能性，是不是就足够保障欧洲安全了呢？
    苏联代表团在指出三国外交部长草案积极的一面的同时，还认为必须注意到它本质上的缺点。
    我们认为，三国部长提出来的所谓“恢复德国的统一和安全”草案的基本缺点就是，这个草案的一切都从属于一个目的：要把整个德国，而且是重新武装起来的德国，包括进北大西洋集团里去。草案里谈到德国重新统一的问题，但是很显然，这个问题并不是草案草拟人所感兴趣的。
    这里有人劝告说要更仔细地研究一下三国部长的草案。当然，这种合理的劝告和温和的态度我们适当地考虑到了。可是对上述草案越研究就越使人相信草案里所提出的建议是不符合根据德国的民族利益和保障欧洲的安全利益统一德国的目的的。
    使人产生这样一种感觉：德国统一问题只有在这样一种情况下才能使草案的草拟者感到兴趣：要统一后的德国成为北大西洋公约组织（北大西洋集团）的一员。所谓关于恢复德国统一的“特别保证”条约也只是在这种情况下才能生效。
    杜勒斯先生很耐心地向我们说明，如果统一后的德国成为华沙条约的成员国时，那末在这种情况下应该在德国问题上作出保证的就不是西方三国了。当然，这种说明是恰当的。但是，杜勒斯先生完全没有谈到这样一个问题：统一后的德国如果能真正自由地选择自己的道路的话，它可能根本不想参加任何集团。关于这一点，无论是三国外长的条约草案中，无论是杜勒斯先生、麦克米伦先生或比内先生在我们的讨论的过程中，都没有作令人信服的说明。
    难道只有事先被我们认为一定要参加某个集团的这样的德国才使我们感到兴趣吗？难道只有为现在存在的集团满意和合乎其愿望的这样的德国才使我们感兴趣，而不是真正有自由选择道路成为民主和和平的国家的德国使我们感兴趣吗？我们觉得，德国的道路应当由德国人民自己决定，这样做是符合他们的自由意志的，但是我们应当关心去协助和及时帮助德国人民，以便使统一后的德国成为爱好和平和民主的国家。
    那时，就没有必要把德国拉入某种集团，以致或多或少地限制德国人民对于在和平和民主基础上重新统一德国这个问题的自由意志了。
    这一切要求我们，首先是在基本问题上，在全欧各国安全的问题上，取得协议。那时，德国问题也就会占有它应有的地位，而不至于令人担忧它会得到片面的解决了。目的在于把统一的德国拉进某种集团的那种片面的解决德国问题的办法，将得不到力求巩固和平和欧洲安全的欧洲人民的同情。
    我再说一次，我们已经取得一些进展——我们大家都承认欧洲安全问题对欧洲人民有头等重要的意义。我们应当采取进一步的措施。
    事实上，如果我们主要是从某种国家集团的利益着眼，从巩固欧洲的某种国家集团着眼，来看欧洲安全问题，这种狭隘的看法是未必会得到欧洲人民的同情的。
    正因为这样，我们就要问：我们大家是不是能够一致同意，我们在这里讨论安全问题时，不是从巩固某种国家集团着眼，而是从欧洲一切国家的安全利益着眼，无论如何，从那些在过去深受德国军国主义的苦难并且竭力不准德国军国主义复活、不许它发动新侵略的那一切欧洲国家的利益着眼。
    苏联代表团请求会议参加者在我们继续讨论之前，先就这个问题发表意见。
