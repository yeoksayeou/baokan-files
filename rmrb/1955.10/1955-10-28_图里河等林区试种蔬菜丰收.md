Trial vegetable planting in forest areas such as Tulihe yields a bumper harvest

This year, the forest area of the Greater Khingan Mountains in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has experimented with planting various vegetables, and since autumn, a bumper harvest has been universally achieved. The vegetable farm in the Tulihe forest area planted more than 20 kinds of vegetables, such as large head cabbage and Shandong cabbage, on more than 50 hectares of land, yielding a total of more than 937,000 jin. Staff members of the Chaocha workshop in the Genhe forest area used their spare time to plant more than three mu of vegetables, harvesting more than 3,700 jin of potatoes alone. The vegetable farm in the Arxan forest area harvested more than 400,000 jin, and some potatoes weighed as much as 1.8 jin each.

The Greater Khingan Mountains forest area is a well-known permafrost zone, where the land is covered with ice and snow for more than half a year. Therefore, people say that only trees grow here, not vegetables, and that all vegetables must be transported by train. In April 1954, the Tulihe forest area established the first warm vegetable room. Under the painstaking management of technician Zhang Jinlin, the warm room was filled with lush green vegetables in the snowy month of April. This spring, Zhang Jinlin cultivated 16,000 vegetable seedlings in the warm room, and then transplanted them when the ice and snow melted in May and June. Therefore, various vegetables can grow vigorously on the frozen soil. (Our correspondent in Hohhot)

    图里河等林区试种蔬菜丰收
    内蒙古自治区大兴安岭林区今年试种了各种蔬菜，入秋以来，已普遍获得丰收。图里河林区蔬菜农场在五十多垧地上种了大头白菜、山东白菜等二十多种蔬菜，共收九十三万七千多斤。根河林区潮查车间的工作人员利用业余时间种了三亩多蔬菜，光是土豆就收了三千七百多斤。阿尔山林区蔬菜农场共收四十多万斤，有的土豆每个竟重达一斤八两。
    大兴安岭林区是有名的万年老冻土地带，这儿的土地有半年以上的时间被冰封雪盖。因此，人们都说这儿光长树木不长菜，要吃菜，全靠火车送进来。一九五四年四月，图里河林区创办了第一座暖菜房，在技术员张金林苦心经营下，落雪的四月天，暖房里已长满了绿油油的青菜。今年春天，张金林在暖房里培育了一万六千株菜苗，等到五、六月，冰消雪化，再移植出来。因此，各种蔬菜都能在冻土上健壮地生长。　（本报驻呼和浩特记者）
