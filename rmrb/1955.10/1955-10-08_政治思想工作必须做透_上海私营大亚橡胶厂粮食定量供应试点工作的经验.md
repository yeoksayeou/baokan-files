    Political and Ideological Work Must Be Thoroughly Done
    – Experiences from the Pilot Program of Grain Rationing in Shanghai's Private Daya Rubber Factory
    Xi Ping
    The private Daya Rubber Factory is the pilot unit for implementing grain rationing in Shanghai's Zhabei District. The factory has 126 employees, including 22 engaged in heavy physical labor, 78 in light physical labor, and 26 administrative personnel. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Zhabei District Grain Planned Supply Office, the factory established a working group and completed the grain rationing work in just five days. As a result, the rations of most employees met the standards stipulated in the "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Cities and Towns," with only three people's food consumption slightly higher than the rationing standard, which could be adjusted within the mess hall. After this pilot work, all employees of the factory further recognized that the grain rationing method is correct and reasonable.
    The reason why the private Daya Rubber Factory was able to successfully complete this work is mainly because it carried out in-depth and meticulous ideological education among the employees, raised the socialist consciousness of the masses, and made compliance with the grain rationing measures a truly conscious action of the masses. Some employees were initially uneasy when they heard that grain rationing was to be implemented, fearing that there would not be enough food. Some said: It is hot now, and we eat less. If we set the ration based on the current consumption, what should we do when it gets cold and we eat more in the future? Some said: It doesn't matter if we eat in the factory during normal work hours, but what about eating out on Sundays? Some said: Implementing rationing is too troublesome. These questions reflected one situation: many employees still had a vague understanding of the rationing method. In this situation, how should we start the grain rationing work? Some people believed: It is not easy to publicize the policy of grain rationing. It is said that if the masses are mobilized, they will "report high grain consumption levels." However, this erroneous opinion of canceling political work was criticized by the leadership. The working group believed that while specific issues raised by the masses should be resolved, the most important issue was how to do a good job in political work.
    In carrying out ideological work, the Daya Rubber Factory first used various forms to popularly publicize the grain rationing policy to the masses, explaining that the method of verifying supply by household could not completely eliminate grain waste, because there were still unreasonable phenomena such as repeated grain purchases and grain outflow after the grain plan was verified. Implementing rationing can fundamentally overcome these shortcomings. After publicizing the state's grain policy, employees were organized to calculate three detailed accounts.
    The first account was the national grain account and the factory's grain account. By calculating the national grain production and needs, it was explained that China's grain production is increasing year by year, and if distributed reasonably, it can be guaranteed to be sufficient. Looking at the factory's grain consumption situation, it was shown whether the rationing could guarantee the needs: in July, the total grain consumption of the factory was 3,587 jin. About 40 people went home for meals every week, requiring about 38 jin of grain, and they used about 152 jin of grain at home every month. Adding this number to the factory's grain consumption, the total was 3,739 jin, an average of more than 29 jin per person. Of course, July is summer, and people may eat less, but based on past experience, even with the widest estimate, assuming it's about 135 jin more on average when it's cold compared to when it's hot, the total is only more than 3,800 jin, an average of more than 30 jin per person per month. This number basically conforms to the state's prescribed rationing standard. Through such detailed calculations, many people's concerns about not having enough to eat were dispelled.
    The second account was the benefit account of grain rationing. Worker Hua Huiquin said at a forum: "Before liberation, whoever had money could buy thousands or tens of thousands of jin of grain to hoard; we poor people worked hard, earned a little money, and still couldn't get enough to eat. I remember once I ran all over the Xinzha Bridge area of Shanghai with a rice bag, but I didn't buy anything, and my whole family starved. But after liberation, I haven't experienced such days even for one day." The workers also cited the fact that since the rectification of the grain planned supply work, the factory's grain consumption has been greatly reduced. Before June, the factory's grain consumption had reached about 3,900 jin, and in July, due to the reduction of some waste, the consumption dropped to more than 3,500 jin, but everyone was still full. This shows that there is still potential for saving grain. A female worker in the factory normally eats in the factory and also has a grain purchase plan at home. The rice bought at home could not be finished, and it rotted after being stored for several months. Some workers also exposed a lawbreaker in Shanghai's Penglai District who borrowed other people's grain purchase certificates to illegally purchase grain more than 100 times and privately transported 1,500 jin of grain. Therefore, everyone realized that in order to eliminate this kind of unreasonable supply and the phenomenon of undermining the state's grain unified purchase and sales policy, it is necessary to assist the government in implementing the grain rationing method.
    The third account was the role of saving grain. A worker named Zhou Ruying said: He once heard a rice store clerk calculate that one liang of rice has more than 300 grains. If every person in the country saves two grains of rice every day, more than 91 million jin of rice can be saved in a year, enough for 10,000 people to eat for 25 years. Therefore, he said that only when the people of the whole country work hard to save grain can the grain unified purchase and sales policy be better implemented, and the country's construction will have a reliable guarantee.
    After calculating these three accounts, everyone's enthusiasm was increased, and some people changed from doubting the grain rationing method to enthusiastically supporting it. On this ideological basis, the factory carried out the work of determining rationing levels. In the process of this work, the principle of letting the masses report their own levels with leadership was adopted. Some workers said that they only knew how much they could eat, and they didn't know how many jin of rice they needed to eat each month. The working group created a "Grain Consumption Estimation Table," based on the standards of "six bowls of rice per jin of rice" and "two bowls of porridge equals one bowl of rice", listing how many bowls of rice were eaten per meal and how many jin of rice were needed each month. This made it possible for the masses to calculate their monthly grain consumption based on their normal appetite, and the numbers on the table were clear at a glance, reducing everyone's trouble. Initially, some people worried that the masses' self-reporting would universally report high levels, but the result of the self-reporting was that more than 90% were within the standards stipulated by the state. The self-reported numbers of more than a dozen people were too low, and the self-reported numbers were appropriately adjusted.
    Political and ideological work must be thorough, and administrative procedures should be as simple as possible – this is the main experience of this pilot work.

    政治思想工作必须做透
    ——上海私营大亚橡胶厂粮食定量供应试点工作的经验 
    习平
    私营大亚橡胶厂是上海闸北区推行粮食定量供应的试点单位。全厂有职工一百二十六人，其中有一般重体力劳动者二十二人、轻体力劳动者七十八人、行政管理人员二十六人。在上海闸北区粮食计划供应办公室领导下，这个厂成立了工作组，仅用五天的时间，就全部完成了粮食定量的工作。结果绝大部分职工的定量都符合“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”规定的标准，只有三个人的食量略高于定量标准，可以在伙食团内得到调剂。经过这次试点工作以后，全厂职工进一步认识到粮食定量供应方法是正确合理的。
    私营大亚橡胶厂所以能顺利地把这项工作做好，主要是对职工群众进行了深入细致的思想教育，提高了群众的社会主义觉悟，使得遵守粮食定量供应办法真正成为群众的自觉行动。有些职工最初听到要实行粮食定量供应，也曾感到不放心，怕粮食不够吃。有的说：现在天热，吃得少，按现在的消费量定量，将来天冷吃得多了怎么办？有的说：平常工作时在厂内吃没有关系，星期天到外面去吃饭怎么办？有的说：实行定量供应，太麻烦了。这些问题反映了一个情况：许多职工对定量供应办法的认识还很模糊。在这种情况下，怎样着手进行粮食定量供应工作呢？有人认为：实行粮食定量供应，不好宣传政策，据说如果群众发动起来了，就会“高报用粮等级”。但这种取消政治工作的错误意见受到了领导方面的批判。工作组认为：群众提出的一些具体问题固然应当给予解决，但最重要的问题还是如何做好政治工作。
    大亚橡胶厂在进行思想工作中，首先是运用各种形式，通俗地向群众宣传粮食定量供应政策，说明按户核实供应办法还不可能完全消灭粮食浪费，因为用粮计划经过核实还有重复购粮、粮食外流等不合理的现象，而实行定量供应就能从根本上克服这些缺点。在宣传国家粮食政策以后，就组织职工来算三笔细账。
    第一笔是算全国的粮食账和本厂的粮食账。通过算全国粮食生产和需要的账，说明我国粮食是逐年增产的，如果分配合理，可以保证够吃够用。再从本厂用粮情况看定量供应是否能保证需要：七月份全厂粮食消费总数是三千五百八十七斤。每星期约有四十个人回家吃饭，约需粮食三十八斤，每个月他们在家用的粮食大约为一百五十二斤。这数字加上厂内用粮数，共为三千七百三十九斤，平均每人二十九斤多。当然七月份是夏天，可能吃得少些，但根据历年来经验，作最宽的打算，按天冷比天热约平均多吃一百三十五斤计算，加起来也只有三千八百多斤，平均每人每月是三十斤多，这个数字和国家规定的定量供应标准是基本上符合的。通过这样的算细账，许多人怕不够吃的顾虑就打消了。
    第二笔是算粮食定量供应的好处账。工人花惠琴在座谈会上说：“解放前，谁有钱谁可以买上几千斤、几万斤粮食囤积起来；我们穷苦人辛辛苦苦地劳动，挣来几个钱，也吃不饱肚子。记得有一次我拿了一只米袋跑遍了上海新闸桥一带，结果什么也没有买回来，大小一家眼睁睁地挨饿。可是解放后，我这样的日子一天也没有过。”工人们还举出这样一个事实：从整顿粮食计划供应工作后，这个工厂的粮食消费量大大降低了，六月份以前，全厂粮食消费量曾达到三千九百斤左右，七月份由于减少了某些浪费，消费量就下降到三千五百多斤，但大家还是吃得饱饱的。这就说明节约粮食的可能性还是有的。厂里有一个女工，平常在厂内吃饭，又在家里订了购粮计划，家里买来的米吃不完，放了几个月，都霉烂了。有的工人还揭发上海蓬莱区的一个不法分子，借了别人的购粮证，套购粮食百多次，私自贩运粮食一千五百斤。因此，大家认识到，要消灭这类供应不合理和破坏国家粮食统销政策的现象，必须协助政府实行粮食定量供应办法。
    第三笔账是算节约粮食的作用。一个名叫周如英的工人说：他曾经听到一个米店的店员算了一笔账：一两米有三百多粒，全国人民每人每天省两粒米，一年就可以节省九千一百多万斤米，够一万个人吃二十五年。因此，他说只有全国人民努力节约粮食，粮食统购统销政策才能更好地贯彻，国家建设才有可靠保证。
    算过这三笔账以后，大家的热情提高了，有些人对粮食定量供应办法由怀疑一变而为热诚拥护。在这个思想基础上，这个工厂进行了确定定量等级的工作。在这一工作过程中，又采取了有领导地放手让群众自报等级的方针。有的工人说只晓得有多大的饭量，弄不清每月究竟要吃多少斤米，工作组就造出了一张“用粮推算表”，根据“斤米六碗饭”和“两稀折一干”的标准，列出每餐吃几碗饭、每月需要多少斤米，这就使得群众能根据自己的正常饭量来算出每月的用粮数，按表对数，一目了然，减少了大家的麻烦。最初曾有人担心过群众自报是否会普遍报高等级，但自报的结果是百分之九十以上都在国家规定的标准内。有十几个人自报等级偏低，也给适当地调整了自报数字。
    政治思想工作必须做透，事务手续力求简单，——这就是这次试点工作的主要经验。
