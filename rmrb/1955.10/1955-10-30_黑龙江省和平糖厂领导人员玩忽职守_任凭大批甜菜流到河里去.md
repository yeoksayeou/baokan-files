    Negligence of Duty by Leaders of Heilongjiang Province Peace Sugar Factory Allows Large Quantities of Sugar Beets to Flow into the River

    To the Editors:
    From September of last year to March of this year, the leaders and staff of the state-owned Heilongjiang Peace Sugar Factory adopted an extremely irresponsible attitude towards state property, resulting in the serious incident of approximately 6,700 tons of sugar beets being lost (not including natural losses and unmeasured losses). Calculated at the purchase price, these sugar beets were worth more than 270,000 yuan; calculated at the factory price after sugar production, they were worth more than 400,000 yuan.

    The production equipment in the washing section of the sugar making workshop of this factory has long had problems—the drainage ditches in places such as stone removal equipment and washing tanks lack iron grates, the conveying wheel is misaligned, and the gap is too wide. As a result, large quantities of sugar beets dropped into the drainage ditches and flowed into the river during the washing process. Workers Liu Fuyuan, Wu Zhanquan, and others discovered this situation and repeatedly reported it to Liu Guangshan, the deputy director of the workshop. However, Liu Guangshan criticized them, saying, "Mind your own business and just do your own job!" Later, when the sugar beets flowing into the drainage ditches blocked them, he even praised those who cleared the ditches to let the sugar beets flow away with the water. Di Cheng, the production section chief and assistant engineer of this factory, also knew about the loss of sugar beets in the washing section, but he remained indifferent as well. What is even more infuriating is that from December of last year to February of this year, the workshop's Party branch secretary, engineers, and many workers repeatedly raised the issue of sugar beet loss with Factory Director Wang Guohua, but Factory Director Wang initially calmly said that "the drainage ditches have grates, they can't run away"; later, after learning that sugar beets were indeed flowing out of the drainage ditches, he actually used "not many are running away" as a self-consoling excuse and still did not quickly find a way to stop this loss. Due to the serious negligence of duty by the aforementioned personnel, the number of sugar beets flowing out of the drainage ditches is estimated to be 5,000 tons.

    The factory also lacked leadership and inspection of sugar beet procurement, storage, and transportation, and no one was responsible for on-site management. As a result, large quantities of sugar beets were subjected to vehicle crushing, animal bites, and spoilage, and even the strange phenomenon of purchasing farmers' sorghum stalks used to block sugar beets on their carts as sugar beets occurred. These few items alone accounted for the loss of more than 1,500 tons of sugar beets.

    In addition, the operating procedures in the sugar making workshop were not sound, the bottom door of the seepage tank was not properly closed several times, and the leakage of sugar water was also very serious. It is estimated that this is equivalent to the loss of nearly 100 tons of sugar beets.

    We, together with the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Industry, conducted an inspection of the incident of massive sugar beet losses at the Peace Sugar Factory. However, Wang Guohua, the director of the sugar factory, actually treated the inspection with a negative attitude; Liu Guangshan, the deputy director of the sugar making workshop, even secretly monitored and threatened workers who approached the inspection team. This shows that they completely lack awareness of the mistakes they have made and have no intention of repentance. The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee has decided to give the relevant personnel punishments such as demotion, removal from office, and demerits.

### 黑龙江省和平糖厂领导人员玩忽职守  任凭大批甜菜流到河里去

    黑龙江省和平糖厂领导人员玩忽职守
    任凭大批甜菜流到河里去编辑同志：
    地方国营黑龙江和平糖厂从去年九月到今年三月间，由于领导工作人员对国家财产采取极端不负责任的态度，以致造成损失甜菜约六千七百吨（不包括自然损失和未测定损失）的严重事件。这些甜菜，按照收购价格计算，值二十七万多元；按照制糖以后的出厂价格计算，值四十多万元。
    这个厂制糖车间洗涤工段的生产设备长期存在着问题——除石器和洗涤槽等处的地沟没有铁篦子，扬送轮不正，间隙过宽。这样，甜菜在洗涤加工过程中大量地掉入地沟，流失到河里去。工人刘福元、武占全等发现了这个情况，多次向车间副主任刘广山反映。但是刘广山反而批评他们说：“少管闲事，把自己的工作做好就行！”后来，流入地沟的甜菜把地沟堵死了，他还表扬那些去通地沟让甜菜顺水流走的人。这个厂的生产科长兼助理工程师狄程也知道洗涤工段流失甜菜的情形，但是同样是无动于衷。更加叫人愤慨的是，从去年十二月到今年二月间，车间党支部书记、工程师和许多工人都多次向王国华厂长提出甜菜流失的问题，而王厂长起初不慌不忙地说是“地沟有篦子，跑不了”；后来知道了从地沟里确实流失了甜菜，竟又用“跑的不多”作为自慰的理由，仍然不去迅速设法制止这种损失。由于上述有关人员严重玩忽职守，甜菜从地沟流失的数字估计达五千吨。
    这个厂对甜菜的收购、保管、运输等工作也缺乏领导和检查，现场管理无人负责，因而大批甜菜遭受车轧、马啃和腐烂变质，甚至发生把农民车上挡甜菜用的秫秸当作甜菜收购的怪现象。光是这几项，损失的甜菜就达到一千五百多吨。
    此外，制糖车间的操作制度不健全，渗出缸底门有好几次没有关好，渗漏糖水的情况也很严重。估计等于漏掉甜菜将近一百吨。
    对和平糖厂大量损失甜菜的事件，我们曾会同黑龙江省工业厅进行过检查。但是，糖厂厂长王国华居然以消极的态度对待检查；制糖车间副主任刘广山甚至暗中监视和威胁同检查组接近的工人。这说明他们对所犯的错误完全缺乏认识，而且也毫无悔改的意思。黑龙江省人民委员会已决定给有关人员以降职、撤职、记过等处分。
