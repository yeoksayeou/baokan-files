Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: According to a report in the "Yomiuri Shimbun" on the 17th, the Japanese Foreign Ministry has decided to formally approve the US plan to continue providing military training to officers from third countries in Japan. The Foreign Ministry will soon exchange formal notes with the US authorities stationed in Japan regarding this matter.

As previously reported, with the consent of the Japanese government, the US has been training foreign military personnel, including those from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, at US military bases in Japan. According to a source from the Japanese Foreign Ministry cited by Agence France-Presse on October 1st, the US and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities in Japan have requested the Japanese government to allow another 400 Chiang Kai-shek bandit soldiers to receive training at US military bases in Japan. The Japanese Foreign Ministry at the time agreed to "study" this request.

Japanese public opinion has strongly criticized the Japanese government for allowing the US to train Chiang Kai-shek bandit soldiers in Japan. Public opinion accuses this behavior of undermining Japanese sovereignty and peace in the Far East.

    美国继续在日训练外国军人
    日本外务省竟然同意美国计划
    新华社十九日讯　东京消息：据“读卖新闻”十七日报道，日本外务省已决定正式批准美国继续在日本对第三国的军官进行军事训练的计划。外务省将在最近同驻日本的美国当局为这件事交换正式照会。
    前已报道，在日本政府的同意之下，美国一直在日本的美国军事基地上训练包括蒋贼军在内的外国军事人员。据法新社十月一日从日本外务省人士得到的消息，在日本的美国和蒋贼当局已经要求日本政府允许再让四百名蒋贼军在日本的美军基地受训。日本外务省当时答应“研究”这一要求。
    日本舆论曾经强烈抨击日本政府允许美国在日本训练蒋贼军。舆论指责这种行为是破坏日本主权和远东和平的。
