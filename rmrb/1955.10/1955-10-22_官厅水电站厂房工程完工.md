    Guanting Hydropower Station Plant Construction Completed

    The concrete construction of the Guanting Hydropower Station plant, after more than four months of intensive work, was completed on October 9th, 11 days ahead of schedule, completing all the main structure.

    The plant construction is the main component of the hydropower station, including the main plant, auxiliary plant, installation room, and cable trenches, with a complex structure. This concrete project was undertaken by a newly established worker team from the Guanting Hydropower Engineering Bureau. During the construction process, they launched labor competitions and implemented a team accounting method, which increased labor efficiency by more than 30%.

    Now, the hydropower station plant stands tall on the northern foothills of the Yongding River, and the installation of mechanical and electrical equipment is proceeding intensely inside. Soon, the enormous current will be transmitted to the people's capital – Beijing – via the erected high-voltage lines. (Cheng Xu)

    官厅水电站厂房工程完工
    官厅水电站厂房混凝土工程，经过四个多月的紧张施工，已于十月九日提前十一天完成全部主体工程。
    厂房工程是水电站的主要组成部分，包括主厂房、副厂房，安装间及电缆沟等，结构复杂。这项混凝土工程是由官厅水力发电工程处一支新成立的工人队伍负责施工的。在施工过程中他们开展了劳动竞赛，并实行了班组核算办法，使劳动效率提高百分之三十以上。
    现在，这座水电站厂房已经高耸在永定河北岸的山麓上，内部正在紧张地进行机电设备安装。不久，巨大的电流即将经过架设好的高压线送到人民的首都——北京。　（程序）
