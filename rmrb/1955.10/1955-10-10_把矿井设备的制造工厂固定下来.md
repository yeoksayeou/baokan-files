Title: Settle Down the Manufacturing Factories for Mining Equipment

To the Editors:

    Currently, in mine construction, many pieces of equipment (such as skips, tippers, headframes, etc.) are designed by the design institutes of each coal mine, and then each mining bureau temporarily finds factories to customize them separately. In this way, the same equipment using the same set of drawings is often manufactured by several different factories. For example, the tippers for the Lingxi shaft in Shuangyashan and the Xiaohengshan shaft in Jixi used the same set of drawings and were manufactured at the same time, but the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau ordered from Fuxin General Machinery Factory, while the Jixi Mining Bureau ordered from Jixi Mining Machinery Factory. The mine cars used in Shuangyashan and Jixi also used the same set of drawings, but some were processed at Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory and some at Jilin Machinery Factory. The mine cars used in the Caitun shaft in Benxi were manufactured partly by Shenyang Bridge Factory and partly by Harbin Machinery Factory. In short, the situation is very chaotic.

    This practice not only makes it difficult for the ordering units to find manufacturers, but also because the order quantity is small, the delivery date is tight, and the manufacturing factories are often manufacturing this product for the first time, resulting in low production efficiency, waste of materials, increased costs, poor product quality, and failure to deliver on time. This not only increases the difficulties and waste of funds for the basic construction units that place orders, but also affects the improvement of the operating management of the manufacturing factories and hinders the improvement of product manufacturing technology.

    The reason for this phenomenon is that, on the one hand, some mining equipment does not yet have finalized products in China; on the other hand, some engineering construction tasks are urgent, and equipment ordering plans cannot be submitted on time. However, at present, the design drawings of mine equipment have gradually been finalized, and in addition to the three mining machinery factories in the coal mine system that can manufacture in large quantities, some machine repair factories of mining bureaus can also manufacture, and factories of the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Third Ministry of Machine Building can also accept orders. Therefore, this problem can be solved. I believe that, except for some simple and bulky equipment that can be produced by local factories to avoid long-distance transportation, the manufacturing factories of other equipment should be fixed in a planned manner. It is hoped that the department in charge of mechanical manufacturing of the Ministry of Coal Industry will actively solve this problem.

### 把矿井设备的制造工厂固定下来

    把矿井设备的制造工厂固定下来编辑同志：
    目前在矿井建设中，有很多设备（如箕斗、翻车机、天轮等）都是由各煤矿设计院做产品设计，再由各矿务局临时分别找工厂订制。这样，用同一套图纸的同一种设备，往往找了几个不同的工厂来制造。例如，双鸭山岭西竖井和鸡西小恒山竖井的翻车机，用的是同一套图纸，又是同一个时间制造的，但是双鸭山矿务局向阜新总机厂订货，鸡西矿务局却向鸡西矿山机械厂订货。双鸭山和鸡西用的矿车也是同一套图纸，但是有的在沈阳矿山机械厂加工，有的在吉林机械厂加工。本溪采屯竖井用的矿车，有的在沈阳桥梁工厂制造，有的又跑到哈尔滨机械厂制造去了。总之，情况是非常混乱的。
    这种做法，不但使用货单位不容易找到承制的工厂；而且由于订货数量少，交货日期紧，承制工厂往往又是第一次制造这种产品，以致发生生产效率低、材料浪费、成本加大、产品质量低劣和不能按期交货的情况。这既使订货的基本建设单位增加困难和浪费了资金；又影响了承制工厂经营管理的改善，妨碍了产品制造技术的提高。
    出现这种现象的原因，一方面是某些矿井设备在国内还没有定型的产品；另一方面是某些工程建设任务紧迫，不能按时提出设备订货计划。但是在目前，矿井的设备的设计图纸已经逐渐定型，而煤矿系统除了三个矿山机械厂可以大批制造外，有些矿务局的机修厂也可以制造，第一机械工业部和第三机械工业部的工厂也可以接受订货。因此，这个问题是有条件来解决的。我认为，除了某些结构简单而又笨重的设备，为了避免长距离运输，可以交给当地工厂生产以外，其它设备的制造厂都应该有计划地固定下来。希望煤炭工业部主管机械制造单位积极解决这个问题。
