Mother
——Remembering Lyubov Kosmodemyanskaya
Han Zi

Upon seeing Zoya's mother, Lyubov Kosmodemyanskaya, who is visiting China for the first time, we all feel as though she has been by our side for a long time.

The first thing I thought of when I saw her was the statue in front of the Soviet War Memorial in Berlin. I had heard it said that in that place, where people always walk past in silence filled with reverence, after passing through the triumphal arch, the first thing one sees is a grey granite statue of a woman. She is sitting in front of strong, evergreen pine and cypress trees, one hand supporting herself, the other on her chest, her head bowed in tragic sorrow. The name of this statue, everyone can immediately think of it: Mother. She silently tells people about the disasters of war and the desire for peace.

Kosmodemyanskaya is precisely the living mother who has stepped out from this statue. She is very tall, and whether sitting or standing, she makes people feel as if they are facing a moving bust, presenting strength and warmly beckoning to people. Zoya's eyes and lips, which we have gazed at countless times, are precisely her mother's features. They are gentle and resolute, and the silvery-white hair only adds to the mother's dignified and kind appearance. The light grey and dark green clothes are very suitable for her light red complexion. I believe that the scarves, shawls, brooches, shoes, and socks, which she changes daily along with her clothes, are still arranged according to Shura's, who loved art, opinions. How harmonious everything about her is. I remember that in "The Story of Zoya and Shura," she twice mentioned that her daughter and son were as afraid of exaggerated words as they were of fire, and Kosmodemyanskaya is also an infinitely simple and genuine person.

The mother wrote: "I was convinced that I could recognize my little daughter among a thousand newborn babies. I believed that the expression on her face and eyes was special, and her voice was also unique." This was once the mother's joy. But after losing Zoya and Shura, I feel that she began to search for similarities to her own children in countless children and young people. That day, when she met Zhang Guilan (who dubbed for Zoya in the film "Danya") at our National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress, although she quickly stopped Zhang Guilan from crying, she recognized Zoya from Zhang Guilan's sincere expression and kind voice. In the car back to the hotel, she couldn't help but say: "I saw my Zoya." Seeing anything can remind her of Zoya and Shura, especially in children and young people, the mother sees the past and present of her own children. Some people are so similar to Zoya in emotion and reason that the mother can see it at a glance!

The memories of Zoya and Shura always tug at the mother's heart. I had two opportunities to hear her recount the scene of her final farewell with her daughter and son. She has said it so many times, but she is still as excited and tearful as if she were talking about something that happened yesterday. She will never see her beloved daughter and son again, and she will never hear her children call her "Mom" again. However, there are tens of thousands of young people around the world who have become her children, calling her "Dear Mom." She came to China, and her Chinese children rushed into her arms, shouting "Mom, dear Mom." The mother's heart was agitated, with tears in her eyes, she said: "My Zoya and Shura did not sacrifice their youth and lives for humanity in vain."

Young people are truly willing to gather all the advantages together to make up a Zoya and a Shura to dedicate to the mother, to care for the mother like Zoya and Shura, and to give the mother the greatest comfort. And as a Communist Party member and a mother, she knows that in pain, only one thing can save her, and that is realizing that people need her, knowing that her existence is not useless. Work has helped her, and she does not feel as uncomfortable and lonely as she used to. She feels that the people need Zoya and Shura, and she has the strength to take on the cause of her children.

For more than ten years, the mother has been working tirelessly.

In the Second World War, more than 40 million lives were lost, more than 30 million people were disabled, and how many people lost their beloved families! In order to prevent mankind from suffering the scourge of war again, we must oppose wars of aggression and strive for lasting peace! Mothers especially deeply feel the value of peace, and striving for peace has become Kosmodemyanskaya's main work. She corresponds with young people and children from more than 20 countries; she attended the World Peace Congress in Paris, and also met with peace-loving mothers from all over the world in Lausanne. She talks and writes about the stories of her daughter and son several times a day. Because of Zoya and Shura, and because of the mother's sincere face and moving words, people immediately gave all their trust to this noble Soviet woman. In many unfamiliar cities, fathers and mothers led their children to recognize this great mother, and the children said timidly but then firmly: they are learning from Zoya and Shura. Women from people's democratic countries surrounded her and asked how to educate their children to be like Zoya and Shura. The mother thought for a moment and replied: "Because I am a Communist Party member, the Party educated me, and I followed the Party's instructions to let my children love labor, love the collective, and love a good life. In our country, there are also schools, the Communist Youth League, and the entire collective that educate them even better than I do."

Many mothers who lost their children in the war regarded Kosmodemyanskaya as their closest confidante. The mother gave them strength when she shook hands with them: "For the sake of the children, let us do more!" "The Story of Zoya and Shura," written with the mother's heart and the mother's special language, is an immortal book, and more than 1.3 million copies have been printed in China. On every page of every book, there are the tears of mothers, young people, and children; but closing the book, standing up, you can feel that you have seen an infinitely pure and bright realm, knowing where you will go.

In the days of peace, there are already countless little girls in the world whose names, foreshadowing happiness and beauty, are called Zoya; and countless children of different nationalities and different skin colors use various different words and languages to call Kosmodemyanskaya "Dear Mom." This is an era belonging to the Zoyas and Shuras, how affectionate and close humanity is! This spring, the mother also received a letter from a longshoreman in the United States, sending her a large photo of him and his daughter. He told the mother that he had been to the Soviet Union in 1946, and Zoya's story deeply moved him for the first time. At that time, he swore that he would name his wife's first daughter Zoya. After returning home, they did give birth to a girl. When naming the daughter, the wife thought that Zoya was not an American name, and the husband told her the story, but living in the United States, she could not help but think that such a name would put her parents at risk of being arrested, because it was a communist name. The longshoreman said: "I swore I would do this. My daughter will be happy with the name of a Soviet hero." There are many, many other Zoyas and Shuras. People only use their best results to name their study units and work units after Zoya and Shura. In schools named after Zoya and Shura, how can the children now sitting in Zoya and Shura's seats doubt that they are not people like Zoya and Shura!

After receiving the invitation notice from China, the mother was extremely excited. She immediately thought: "Six hundred million people, haven't forgotten me!" Chinese children have been corresponding with her for several years, and she still remembers how she shed tears when she first saw the square characters writing "Dear Mom." For six years, Chinese children have often reported to her about various aspects of their homeland's life, making her feel like she has entered her own big family. But she is even more eager to see these black-haired, black-eyed daughters and sons in person. She came, and almost everyone did not miss every word of the news about her in the newspaper. I believe that only Kosmodemyanskaya herself can clearly say how the Chinese welcome her. In the reception room of the hotel, I saw Xiao Wanzhao from the Junior Class of the Central Conservatory of Music, holding her report card full of fives (excellent) and only two fours (good), piously waiting for the mother. When she knew that she could not see the mother, she had to lie on the table with tears in her eyes and write a letter. I glanced at it, and she was writing: "Dear Mom, how much I want to see you, even if it is for a minute..." Later, she sighed and wrote her name below "Your black-eyed daughter."

Mother – the most affectionate and beautiful word in mankind, Comrade Kosmodemyanskaya, this is the common name that young people and children have for you. May the mother live forever! (Attached picture)

    母亲
    ——记柳鲍夫·科斯莫杰米扬斯卡娅
    菡子
    看见卓娅的妈妈——柳鲍夫·科斯莫杰米扬斯卡娅了，她第一次到中国来，可是我们谁都觉得她早已在我们的身边。
    我一看见她，立刻想起的是柏林苏军纪念碑前的塑像。听人叙述过在那被人们怀着崇敬的心情始终只能沉默地走过的地方，踏进凯旋门后，首先看见的是一座灰花岗石的妇人的塑像，她一手撑坐一手抚胸，坐在苍劲而常青的松柏树前，悲壮而哀痛地垂下她的头。这座塑像的名字，谁都可以立即想到的就是：母亲。她无声地向人们叙述着战争的灾难和和平的愿望。
    科斯莫杰米扬斯卡娅正是从这座塑像里走出来的活的母亲。她很高大，无论坐着或站着，都使人感觉到面前有一座动人的胸像，呈现着力量，并向人们亲切地召唤着什么。那被我们无数次注视过的卓娅的眼睛和嘴唇也正是母亲的特征，它们是温柔而坚毅的，银白色的头发只增加了母亲庄严而慈祥的神色。淡灰色和深绿色的衣裙跟她淡红的肤色很相称。每天随着衣服更换的围巾、披肩、别针、鞋袜，我相信她还是照着喜爱美术的舒拉的意见安排的，她的一切有多么和谐。记得她在“卓娅和舒拉的故事”中两次说到自己的女儿和儿子都像怕火一样怕说夸张的话，科斯莫杰米扬斯卡娅也正是一个无限朴素和真实的人。
    母亲写过：“我曾深信我能在一千个新生的婴儿中，认出自己的小女儿来，我相信她的脸和眼睛的表情是特殊的，她的声音也是与众不同的。”这曾经是母亲的喜悦。但是在失去卓娅和舒拉以后，我觉得她开始在无数的孩子和年青人中寻觅同自己孩子的相似之处了。那天她在我们全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上见着张桂兰（曾在影片“丹娘”中为卓娅配音），她虽然连忙不让张桂兰流泪，但是从张桂兰真挚的表情和亲切的声音中，她认出了卓娅。在回到旅馆的车中，她忍不住说了：“我看到了我的卓娅”。看见什么都能想起卓娅和舒拉，特别在孩子们和青年人身上，母亲看见了自己孩子的过去和现在。有一些人在感情和理智上那么酷似卓娅，母亲一眼便看出来了！
    对于卓娅和舒拉的回忆，随时牵连着母亲的心。我有两次机会听她叙述同女儿和儿子最后别离的情景。她说了有多少遍，可是她仍像说起昨天发生的事情一样，激动着，含着眼泪。她再看不到自己亲爱的女儿和儿子了，再听不到自己的孩子叫她“妈妈”了。但是，全世界有成千上万的青年，成了她的孩子，叫她“亲爱的妈妈”。她来到中国，她的中国的孩子们，扑到她的怀里喊着“妈妈，亲爱的妈妈”。母亲的心激动着，含着眼泪，说：“我的卓娅和舒拉没有白白的把青春和生命献给人类。”
    年青人真愿意把所有的优点集中起来，凑成一个卓娅一个舒拉去献给母亲，像卓娅和舒拉一样来体贴母亲，给母亲最大的安慰。而作为一个共产党员的母亲，她知道：在痛苦中，只有一件东西能拯救她，这就是觉悟到人们需要她，知道她的生存并不是无益的。工作帮助了她，她并不觉得像过去那样难受，那样孤单。她觉得人民需要卓娅和舒拉，她就有力量把儿女的事业承担过来。
    十多年来，母亲不倦地工作着。
    在第二次世界大战中损失四千多万个生命，有三千多万人成了残废，还有多少人失去自己可爱的家庭呵！为了使人类不再遭受战争惨祸，要反对侵略战争，争取持久的和平！母亲们特别深刻地感到和平的可贵，争取和平的工作，成了科斯莫杰米扬斯卡娅的主要工作。她同二十几个国家的年青人和孩子们通信；她出席过巴黎的世界保卫和平大会，也在洛桑同全世界爱好和平的母亲们见了面。她每天几次谈着和写着自己女儿和儿子的故事，人们因为卓娅和舒拉，因为母亲真挚的面容和动人的言语，一下子把全部的信任给了这位崇高的苏维埃妇女。在许多陌生的城市里，父亲和母亲们领着自己的孩子来认认这位伟大的母亲，孩子胆怯地而随即又坚定地说了：他们正在学着卓娅和舒拉。人民民主国家的妇女们围着她请教怎样把孩子教育成卓娅和舒拉那样，母亲想了一下，回答：“因为我是一个共产党员，党教育了我，我又照着党的意思让孩子们热爱劳动，热爱集体，热爱美好的生活。在我们国家里，比我更好地教育他们的还有学校、共青团以及整个集体。”
    许多在战争中失去孩子的母亲把科斯莫杰米扬斯卡娅当作最亲密的知心朋友。母亲就在同她们握手的时候，给了她们力量：“为了孩子，让我们更多做一点事情吧！”那以母亲的心血和母亲特殊的语言写成的“卓娅和舒拉的故事”，是一本不朽的书，在中国就印了一百三十多万册。在每一本书的每一页上，都有母亲们、年青人和孩子们的眼泪；但合上书本，站起来，就能感觉自己看见了无限纯洁和光明的境界，知道自己将往那里走去。
    在和平的日子里，世界上已有无数预示着幸福和美好的小女孩的名字叫做卓娅；还有无数不同民族不同肤色的孩子用各种不同的文字和语言，叫科斯莫杰米扬斯卡娅“亲爱的妈妈”，这是属于卓娅们和舒拉们的时代，人类是多么相亲和相近呵！今年春天母亲还接到美国一个码头工人寄来的信，寄来他和自己女儿的大照片。他告诉母亲说：他在一九四六年到过苏联，卓娅的故事第一次深深地感动了他，那时他就起誓要把妻子生下的第一个女儿叫做卓娅。回国后，他们果真生了一个女孩。在为女儿命名时，妻子认为卓娅不是美国人的名字，丈夫把故事告诉了她，但是生活在美国，她不能不想起这样的名字将要使父母有被逮捕的危险，因为这是一个共产主义的名字呵。码头工人说：“我起过誓我一定要这样做。女儿叫苏联英雄的名字会幸福的。”还有许许多多的卓娅和舒拉。人们有了最好的成绩，才把自己的学习单位和工作单位冠上卓娅和舒拉的名字，在以卓娅和舒拉为名的学校里，现在坐在卓娅和舒拉位置上的孩子，怎么能怀疑她们不是卓娅和舒拉那样的人呢！
    母亲接到中国的邀请通知以后是异常激动的，她立刻想到：“六万万人哪，没有忘记我哪！”中国的孩子们同她通信已有几年的历史了，她还记得第一次看见方块字写着“亲爱的妈妈”时，她是怎么流泪的。六年来，中国的孩子们时常向她报告祖国各方面的生活，使她像走进自己的大家庭里一样。但她更渴望亲自见一见这些黑头发黑眼睛的女儿和儿子。她来了，几乎所有的人没有放过报纸上关于她的消息的每一个字。我相信只有科斯莫杰米扬斯卡娅自己才能说清楚中国人是怎样欢迎她的。我在旅馆的会客室里，看见中央音乐学院少年班的小万昭，拿着她满是五分和仅有两个四分的成绩单，虔诚地等着母亲。当她知道见不着母亲时，她只得含着眼泪伏在桌子上写起信来，我斜眼看了一下，她正写着：“亲爱的妈妈，我多么想见见你，那怕一分钟也好……”后来她叹着气把自己的名字写在“你的黑眼睛的女儿”下面。
    母亲——人类中最亲切和美好的字眼，科斯莫杰米扬斯卡娅同志，这就是年青人和孩子们对你的共同的称呼。愿母亲万寿无疆！（附图片）
