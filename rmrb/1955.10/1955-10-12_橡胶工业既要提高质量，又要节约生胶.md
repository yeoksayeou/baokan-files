The rubber industry must both improve quality and save raw rubber
Wang Ruxing

    Since the National Rubber Industry Technological Innovation Advanced Experience Exchange Conference was held last December, rubber companies across the country have actively improved quality and saved raw rubber. In terms of product quality: taking tires and rubber shoes, the two main products, as examples, the physical and mechanical properties have mostly reached or exceeded the specified indicators, and the fluctuation range has been reduced. For example, the wear reduction of a certain type of automobile tire produced by the state-owned No. 1 Rubber Factory was an average of 0.5 to 0.8 cubic centimeters per mile in 1954, and this year it has increased to between 0.5 and 0.7 cubic centimeters per mile. The tensile strength of the upper of rubber shoes produced by the local state-owned Dafu Rubber Factory has increased from a maximum of 162 kg in the past to 175 kg (the greater the tensile strength, the more durable). In terms of saving raw rubber: according to incomplete statistics, as of the end of June, the country had saved 1,024 tons, completing more than 68% of the annual saving target (1,500 tons) determined by the National Rubber Industry Conference. Shanghai and Liaoning Province have already completed their assigned annual tasks. This shows that the potential for savings in the rubber industry is very large.

    In implementing the task of improving quality and saving raw rubber, the relevant leading departments and enterprises have carried out a lot of organizational and technical work. For example, the Rubber Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry organized a national actual mileage test for automobile tires (which is still ongoing), and the Light Industry Bureau of the local industrial department organized a unified design for rubber shoes. Seven new styles of rubber shoes have now been designed, and a national rubber shoe professional meeting was held in Beijing on August 16 to determine the implementation of the new design scheme nationwide. The quality of the newly designed rubber shoes can guarantee that the average service life will be increased by 25 to 30 percent, as determined at the National Rubber Industry Conference last year; based on this year's total production of rubber shoes, more than 500 tons of raw rubber can also be saved. In terms of technical work, rubber companies have generally improved product formulas and structural designs based on past product quality defects and production waste, using reclaimed rubber instead of raw rubber, and strengthening and improving process technology to overcome waste in production. Several more important advanced experiences, such as "segmented rubber mixing", "gradual temperature increase vulcanization", and "rubber shoe seam helping the last", have also been promoted successively. This has played a significant role in guaranteeing and improving product quality and saving raw materials.

    Does this mean that the production situation in the rubber industry is very good now? No. At present, many companies pay special attention to saving, but do not pay enough attention to improving product quality, and lack effective guarantees. Due to the one-sided emphasis on saving and ignoring product quality, quality accidents have occurred, causing great losses. For example, when the state-owned No. 4 Rubber Factory produced gold ingot rain boots, in order to save raw rubber, it arbitrarily changed the structure and formula design, reducing the thickness of the rubber surface by 0.2 mm compared to the past, reducing the rubber content of the toe and heel lining leather by 10 percent, reducing the thickness by 0.5 mm, and narrowing the two sides of the outsole by 2 mm. Production began without actual wear testing, resulting in quality accidents in which approximately 40,000 to 60,000 pairs of shoes had heel cracks and the soles came off; when the local state-owned Liaoning Rubber Factory produced sneakers in the first quarter of this year, it blindly changed the outsole pattern design and produced them in large quantities without careful research and testing, resulting in a large number of bottom folding accidents, with losses in compensation and price reductions of approximately 600,000 yuan.

    Waste in production is still very common, and there is a lack of comprehensive conservation measures. Many factories do not strictly control technical standards and raw material consumption quotas, resulting in large raw material losses and a large number of substandard products and defective products. For example, the consumption rate of gold ingot rain boot lining cloth is only 12 percent at the Shanghai Dafu Rubber Factory, while it is as high as 30 percent or more at the state-owned No. 4 Rubber Factory; the reclaim rate of rubber compounds at various rubber shoe factories is generally around 50 percent, and some exceed 60 percent. Some companies also have the phenomenon of so-called "downgrading" of using semi-finished products with high rubber content in parts with low rubber content, which is not only wasteful but also affects product quality. The defective rate of automobile inner liners produced by the state-owned No. 7 Rubber Factory in August reached more than 60 percent. Production and economic losses caused by mechanical equipment accidents are also very large, and this situation exists in all factories, only to varying degrees.

    Some leading staff and workers in enterprises equate improving quality with saving. They believe that to improve quality, one cannot save, and to save, one cannot guarantee product quality. Therefore, when the superior leading organs require strict economy, they ignore product quality; conversely, when the superior leading organs point out that ignoring product quality is wrong, they ignore overcoming waste. The gold ingot shoe quality accident that occurred at the state-owned No. 4 Rubber Factory was caused by unilaterally considering saving raw rubber and blindly changing the product structure design and formula. After inspection and criticism by the Rubber Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, the leaders of this factory went to another extreme: they modified the product structure design and formula without in-depth research, increasing the amount of rubber used per pair of shoes from 145 cm to 213 cm. Facts have proved that as long as the product structure and formula are carefully studied and improved, it is entirely possible to improve quality and save money at the same time. For example, the new gold ingot shoe design scheme introduced at the National Rubber Shoe Professional Conference this year uses only 142 cm of rubber per pair, and preliminary wear tests have proved that the quality far exceeds that of the products currently produced by various factories.

    Some enterprises have weak technical management, and process regulations and inspection systems have not been implemented. In the state-owned No. 7 Rubber Factory, the tire cord fabric coating was initially too thin, resulting in eight substandard products, and the workshop technician arbitrarily changed the technical standards and increased the thickness by 0.5 mm, resulting in a large overspending of mixed rubber. In August, when the state-owned No. 1 Rubber Factory inspected the causes of defective products, it found that the vast majority were caused by careless operation and lax inspection control. For example, steel wire breakage in automobile tires, uneven thickness of automobile inner tubes, tearing, and glue falling off automobile inner liners, etc., can all be overcome as long as the process regulations are strictly implemented in production and the inspection work of production is strengthened.

    In order to guarantee the victorious completion of this year's rubber industry tasks, rubber companies must further mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, tap the potential for savings, and resolutely achieve the requirement that the average mileage of automobile tires reaches 25,000 to 30,000 kilometers, and the average service life of rubber shoes increases by 25 to 30 percent. We know that poor product quality or a large number of defective products and substandard products is the greatest waste of raw materials, and this is one aspect; on the other hand, one cannot use the method of wasting raw materials as a condition for guaranteeing product quality. Saving materials should be the result of improving technology and improving management, and it must not be the result of cutting corners and shoddy workmanship. Therefore, while saving raw materials, it is necessary to pay attention to and guarantee improved quality; similarly, while guaranteeing and improving quality, it is also necessary to pay attention to saving raw materials. In the past few months, various companies have made certain achievements in completing the task of saving raw rubber, but the current serious task is to guarantee improved product quality, but at the same time, it should be recognized that the potential for savings is still very large. There is a difference of 128 to 203 cm in the amount of rubber used for sneakers, and a difference of 33 to 45 percent in the rubber content of the outsole. If the average amount of rubber used for rubber shoes is reduced by 5 cm per pair, 400 tons of raw rubber can be saved if calculated based on an annual production of 80 million pairs. Therefore, it is wrong to think that "there is no oil or water left in saving." In terms of technical work, a careful inspection should be carried out on the technical measures that have been formulated and implemented in the past in order to find out which measures are reasonable and feasible and which are unreasonable. All reasonable and feasible measures must be implemented, and unreasonable measures should be corrected and then implemented. In order to further improve the technical level of employees and improve the order of production technology, enterprises should actively overcome all difficulties and carry out the implementation of product technical conditions. Through this work, the product design should be improved, the production process technology should be improved, the process order should be improved, the inspection and testing work should be strengthened, and the process regulations should be implemented, so as to guarantee the continuous improvement of product quality on the basis of improving the level of technical work.

    橡胶工业既要提高质量，又要节约生胶
    王汝兴
    自从去年十二月召开全国橡胶工业技术革新先进经验交流大会以来，全国各橡胶企业都积极提高质量和节约生胶。在产品质量方面：以轮胎和胶鞋两种主要产品为例，物理机械性能大都达到或超过了规定指标，并缩小了波动幅度。如国营第一橡胶厂的一种汽车外胎的磨耗减量，一九五四年每哩平均在○点五至○点八立方公分之间，今年已提高到每哩○点五至○点七立方公分之间。地方国营大孚橡胶厂胶鞋鞋面的扯断力已由过去最高一六二公斤提高到一七五公斤（扯断力愈大，愈耐穿）。在节约生胶方面：据不完全统计，截至六月末全国已节约了一千零二十四吨，完成了全国橡胶工业会议确定全年节约（一千五百吨）任务的百分之六十八以上，其中上海市和辽宁省已完成了分配的全年任务。这说明了在橡胶工业中，节约潜力是很大的。
    在贯彻提高质量和节约生胶的任务中，各有关领导部门和各企业都进行了许多组织工作和技术工作。如由轻工业部橡胶工业管理局负责组织了全国性的汽车轮胎实际行驶里程试验（现在还继续进行），由地方工业部轻工业局负责组织了胶鞋的统一设计，现已设计了七种新式胶鞋，并于八月十六日在北京召开了全国胶鞋专业会议，确定在全国范围内推行新设计方案。新设计的胶鞋的质量，能够保证达到去年全国橡胶工业会议上所确定平均提高穿用寿命百分之二十五到三十的要求；按今年全年胶鞋生产量计算，还可以节约五百多吨生胶。各橡胶企业在技术工作上一般也根据过去产品质量的缺点和生产上的浪费现象进行了产品配方和结构设计的改进，使用再生胶代替生胶，以及加强和改进工艺技术，克服生产中的浪费等。对几项比较重要的先进经验，如“分段炼胶”、“逐步升温硫化”、“胶鞋缝帮套楦”等，也先后推广了。这对保证和提高产品质量，节约原材料都起着很大作用。
    是不是说，现在橡胶工业的生产情况就很好了呢？不是的。在目前，很多企业特别重视节约，但对提高产品质量不够重视，缺乏有效的保证。由于片面强调节约，忽视产品质量，就发生了质量事故，造成很大损失。例如，国营第四橡胶厂生产元宝雨鞋时，为了节约生胶，随便改变了结构和配方设计，使胶面厚度比过去减薄了○点二公厘，包头和后跟衬皮含胶率降低了百分之十，厚度减薄了○点五公厘，大底两边缩小了二公厘，未经实际穿用试验即开始生产，结果约有四至六万双鞋发生了后跟裂口脱底的质量事故；地方国营辽宁橡胶厂今年第一季生产球鞋时，盲目改变大底花纹设计，没有慎重研究和试验就大批生产，结果发生了大批折底的事故，赔偿和减价的损失约六十多万元。
    生产上的浪费现象还很普遍，也缺乏全面的节约措施。很多工厂对技术标准和原材料消耗定额都控制不严、掌握不准，因之原材料的耗损大，不合格品和废品也很多。例如元宝雨鞋口里布的耗损率，上海大孚橡胶厂仅有百分之十二，而国营第四橡胶厂高达百分之三十以上；各胶鞋厂胶料的回制率一般都在百分之五十左右，有的超过百分之六十。有些企业还有把含胶率高的半成品用在含胶率低的部位上去的所谓“降级使用”现象，这不仅是浪费，也影响产品质量。国营第七橡胶厂八月份生产的汽车垫带废品率达百分之六十多。由于机械设备发生事故造成的生产上和经济上的损失也很大，这种情况各厂都有，只是在程度上有所不同而已。
    有些企业的领导工作人员和职工把提高质量同节约对立起来。他们认为要提高质量就不能节约，要节约就不能保证产品质量。所以，当上级领导机关要求厉行节约的时候，他们忽视了产品质量；反之，上级领导机关指出忽视产品质量是不对的时候，他们又忽视克服浪费。国营第四橡胶厂发生的元宝鞋质量事故，就是由于片面考虑节约生胶，而盲目改变产品结构设计和配方所造成的。经轻工业部橡胶工业管理局检查批判后，这个厂的领导人员又走了另一极端：不经深入研究就修改产品结构设计和配方，把每双鞋的用胶量由一四五公分增高到二一三公分。事实证明，只要认真研究，改进产品结构和配方，是完全可以作到既能提高质量而又能节约的。例如今年全国胶鞋专业会议上介绍的新元宝鞋设计方案，每双用胶量仅有一四二公分，据初步穿用试验证明，质量远远超过现在各厂的产品。
    有些企业技术管理薄弱，工艺规程和检验制度没有贯彻。国营第七橡胶厂车胎帘布挂胶，最初由于过薄造成了八匹不合格品，车间技术员竟擅自改变了技术标准，增加了○点五公厘厚度，结果，使混练胶大量超支。八月份，国营第一橡胶厂检查产生废品的原因时，发现绝大部分是操作马虎和检查控制不严所造成的。如汽车外胎钢丝折断、汽车内胎厚薄不匀、扯坏、汽车垫带掉胶等等毛病，只要在生产中严格贯彻工艺规程，加强生产的检验工作，都是可以克服的。
    为了保证胜利地完成今年橡胶工业的任务，各橡胶企业今后还必须进一步发动群众、依靠群众，挖掘节约潜力，坚决实现汽车轮胎行驶里程平均达到二万五千到三万公里，胶鞋穿用寿命平均提高百分之二十五到三十的要求。我们知道，产品质量不好，或者废品和不合格品多，就是对原材料最大的浪费，这是一方面；另一方面，也不能以浪费原材料的办法来作为保证产品质量的条件。节约用料应该是提高技术、改进管理的结果，绝不能是偷工减料、粗制滥造的结果。因此，节约原材料的同时，必须注意和保证提高质量；同样，在保证和提高质量的同时，也必须注意节约原材料。过去几个月各企业在完成节约生胶任务方面是有一定成绩的，当前的严重任务则是保证提高产品质量，但同时应该认识节约的潜力还是很大的。球鞋用胶量有一二八至二○三公分之差，大底含胶率有百分之三十三至百分之四十五之差。如果胶鞋用胶平均每双减少五公分，按年产八千万双计算，即可节约生胶四百吨。因此，以为“节约没油水了”是错误的。在技术工作方面，要对过去已制定和已进行的技术措施进行一次认真的检查，以便找出哪些措施是合理可行的，哪些是不合理的。凡是合理可行的就必须贯彻，不合理的就加以纠正，然后贯彻执行。为了进一步提高职工技术水平和健全生产技术秩序，各企业应积极克服一切困难，开展实施产品技术条件工作，通过这项工作，以改进产品设计、改善生产工艺技术，健全工艺秩序，加强检查检验工作和贯彻工艺规程，从而在提高技术工作水平基础上，保证不断提高产品质量。
