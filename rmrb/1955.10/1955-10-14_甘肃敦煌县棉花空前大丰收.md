    Gansu Dunhuang County Achieves Unprecedented Bumper Cotton Harvest
    Dunhuang County, Gansu Province, has achieved its biggest cotton harvest in history this year. The county planted more than 53,600 mu of cotton this year, more than three times the area in 1954, accounting for more than 29 percent of the county's total cultivated area. At the same time, the yield per unit area has also greatly increased, with an average yield of more than 370 jin of seed cotton per mu, equivalent to more than 120 jin of ginned cotton per mu, exceeding the original plan by more than 60 percent, and increasing by more than 88 percent compared with 1954. The highest yield was more than 750 jin of seed cotton per mu, equivalent to more than 250 jin of ginned cotton.
    The cotton in Dunhuang County this year is not only high in yield, but also of excellent quality: the fiber length reaches 25.26 mm, the ginning outturn is about 38 percent, the cotton fiber has a soft and fine luster, and there are very few diseased or rotten bolls, making it an excellent raw material for the textile industry. Farmers are currently harvesting, and the first flush of cotton has already entered the market in large quantities. It is estimated that the county can sell more than 60,000 dan of ginned cotton to the state this year.
    Dunhuang County is a very good cotton producing area. The frost-free period throughout the year is between 180 and 200 days, the soil quality is good, and the rainfall is low, but there is sufficient snowmelt and spring water from the Qilian Mountains for cotton field irrigation. This year, the Dunhuang County People's Committee adopted some concrete measures to ensure the completion of the expanded cotton field plan, trained more than 500 farmer technicians, improved cotton planting techniques, and adopted all of the superior Soviet cotton seeds, thus achieving an overall bumper harvest.

    甘肃敦煌县棉花空前大丰收
    甘肃省敦煌县今年棉花获得有史以来的大丰收。全县今年种植了五万三千六百多亩棉花，比一九五四年扩大三倍以上，占全县总耕地面积百分之二十九以上；同时今年的单位面积产量也大大提高，平均每亩可产籽棉三百七十多斤，折合皮棉每亩一百二十多斤，超过原订计划百分之六十以上，比一九五四年增产百分之八十八以上。最多的每亩可产籽棉七百五十多斤，折合皮棉二百五十多斤。
    敦煌县今年的棉花不仅产量高，而且质量也很好：棉花的纤维长度达二十五点二六公厘，衣分达百分之三十八左右，棉花的纤维光泽柔细，殭瓣烂铃极少，是纺织工业很好的原料。目前农民正在采摘，头花已大量上市，估计全县今年可卖给国家六万多担皮棉。
    敦煌县是一个很好的棉产区。全年无霜期在一百八十天到二百天之间，土质好，雨量少，但有祁连山的雪水泉水足供棉田灌溉之用。今年敦煌县人民委员会采取一些具体措施保证完成了扩大棉田计划，并训练了五百多名农民技术手，改进了植棉技术，又全部采用了苏联优良棉种，因而获得全面丰收。　（平正祥、何联瑞）
