Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's youth shock brigades (groups) and youth thrift teams (groups) have expanded from basic construction, factories, and mines to rural and pastoral areas. According to incomplete statistics for August, there are currently more than 200 youth shock brigades (groups) and 139 youth thrift teams (groups) in the region. They have become a shock force in the struggle against difficulties and waste.

The shock brigade members on the industrial front are using unparalleled enthusiasm to successively break the new quotas for 1955. Ma Jishan's plastering shock brigade of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways reached 120% of the quota; shock brigade member Lu Bogen increased his plastering from a quota of 33 square meters to 200 square meters, exceeding the quota by five times.

The shock brigade members on the agricultural and pastoral fronts have played an important role in production, drought resistance, flood control, grass cutting, epidemic prevention, and wool gathering. Since August, Wuyuan County has experienced continuous rainfall. The shock brigade members of the United Agricultural Production Cooperative put forward the slogan "Every grain returns home to welcome the convening of the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference," braving the heavy rain to salvage the wheat soaked in water. When weeding, the shock brigade of the Jiguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jining County specialized in weeding tall grass and grass far from the road. Ten people weeded 54 mu of land in one day, exceeding the quota by 62.9%. In Ik Zhao League, the Xilin Usu pastoral production permanent mutual aid group's shock brigade of nine young people dug two circles and two wells in one week, dug 21 zhang of trenches, washed 450 sheep, and assisted epidemic prevention workers in treating 128 livestock diseases, and injected epidemic prevention shots into more than 1,000 livestock.

The thrift team members have established "Gold Storehouses," "Treasure Bowls," or "Youth Warehouses" in many construction sites and factories in Baotou City. In the three activities of collecting waste materials, the thrift team members of the Baotou City No. 1 Brick and Tile Factory collected more than 600 straw curtains, more than 700 earth baskets, and more than 700 jin of coke.

    内蒙古青年突击队和节约队
    在生产战线上发挥重要作用
    内蒙古自治区的青年突击队（组）和青年节约队（组）已经从基本建设、厂矿等单位发展到农村、牧区。根据八月份不完全统计，全区现有二百多个青年突击队（组）、一百三十九个青年节约队（组）。他们已经成为同困难作斗争、同浪费作斗争的突击力量。
    工业战线的突击队员们正用无比热情相继突破一九五五年的新定额。铁道部第三工程面马继山抹灰工突击队达到定额的百分之一百二十；突击队员陆伯根在抹灰中由定额三十三平方公尺达到二百平方公尺，超过定额五倍。
    农牧业战线上的突击队员在生产、抗旱、防洪、打草、防疫、拣羊毛等方面都起了重要作用。五原县八月以来连下阴雨，联合农业生产合作社的突击队员提出“颗粒还家，迎接全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会召开”的口号，冒着大雨去打捞泡在水里的麦子。集宁县集光农业生产合作社突击队锄草时专锄草长的和路远的，十个人一天锄了五十四亩地，超过定额百分之六十二点九。伊克昭盟乌审旗锡林乌苏牧业生产常年互助组的突击组的九个青年在一星期中就打了两个圈，修了两口井，挖了二十一丈长的壕，洗了四百五十只羊，还协助防疫工作人员医治了一百二十八只牲畜的疾病，给一千多头牲畜注射了防疫针。
    节约队员们在包头市不少工地、工厂建立了“黄金库”“聚宝盆”或“青年仓库”。包头市第一砖瓦厂的节约队员在三次收集废旧物料活动中，就拣回草帘子六百多块、土筐七百多个和焦炭七百多斤。（本报驻呼和浩特记者）
