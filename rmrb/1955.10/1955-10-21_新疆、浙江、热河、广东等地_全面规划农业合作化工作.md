    Xinjiang, Zhejiang, Rehe, Guangdong and other places
    Comprehensively plan agricultural collectivization work
    (By our dispatch) To welcome the new high tide of the agricultural collectivization movement, Xinjiang, Zhejiang, Rehe, Guangdong and other places have comprehensively planned the agricultural collectivization work.
    The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the spirit of the Third Party Congress of Xinjiang and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Xinjiang, has formulated a comprehensive plan for agricultural collectivization in Xinjiang. According to this plan, the agricultural areas of Xinjiang can be basically collectivized by 1960. Xinjiang currently has 1,702 agricultural production cooperatives. The newly formulated plan requires the establishment of another 3,469 cooperatives in 1956. The number of farmer households joining the cooperatives will account for more than 17% of the total number of farmer households. In 1957, 5,096 new cooperatives will be established, reaching a total of 10,267 including the old cooperatives, with farmer households joining the cooperatives accounting for 36.41% of the total number of farmer households. By 1960, it is estimated that the number of agricultural cooperatives in Xinjiang will develop to 18,000. The number of farmer households joining the cooperatives will account for 85% of the total number of farmer households. In the face of the coming high tide of the agricultural collectivization movement, farmers of all ethnic groups are very enthusiastic about establishing cooperatives. More and more people are applying to transfer to cooperatives and establish cooperatives.
    Currently, more than 2,100 townships in Zhejiang Province have conducted comprehensive planning for agricultural collectivization. The CCP branches in these townships have formulated or are formulating comprehensive plans for collectivization and the development of agricultural production in the entire township. In the process of planning, poor and lower-middle peasants in various places have been greatly encouraged, and most of them are eagerly requesting to join the cooperatives. Some townships are now expanding old cooperatives and establishing new cooperatives in conjunction with consolidating the original agricultural production cooperatives. By the beginning of October, Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Jinhua and other regions had built and were building a total of more than 6,500 new cooperatives, and more than 2,700 old cooperatives were also absorbing new members. More than 103,000 poor and lower-middle peasant households have joined agricultural production cooperatives. After the completion of typical experiments on comprehensive collectivization planning in more than 300 townships in Zhejiang Province in September, party committees in various places conscientiously summarized the experiences of these townships. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also held a meeting to study the experiences and lessons of the townships that conducted typical experiments, and carried out comprehensive collectivization planning work in batches in various townships throughout the province.
    The Rehe Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the county and banner committees conducted typical experiments on comprehensive collectivization planning in September. Among the villages (equivalent to townships within the pass) where typical experiments were carried out, some had a better collectivization movement, some had a poor foundation for mutual assistance and cooperation, and some were scattered mountain villages. After planning, the collectivization movement in various types of villages has developed more healthily. According to the statistics of only 20 villages, the number of farmer households preparing to join the old cooperatives and establish new cooperatives this winter has increased by more than double the total number of farmer households in the original old cooperatives in each village. After planning, the CCP branches in these villages have a clear understanding and the enthusiasm for leading the collectivization movement has been greatly improved. At present, the village branches are leading the farmers to prepare for the establishment and expansion of cooperatives in accordance with the plan.
    When the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently revised the province's comprehensive plan for agricultural collectivization, it focused on checking and deploying the work of developing agricultural production cooperatives in major grain-producing areas, economic crop areas, and other key areas. The Provincial Party Committee particularly emphasized in the inspection that the future development of collectivization should implement the policy of "comprehensive expansion, with collectivization in key areas first." The revised comprehensive plan determines that after the development of agricultural cooperatives in Guangdong Province from this autumn to next spring, the number of farmer households joining the cooperatives will account for 33% of the total number of farmer households in the province. In the above-mentioned key areas, the number of farmer households joining the cooperatives should be developed to 37.4% of the total number of local farmer households. By 1957, the number of farmer households joining the cooperatives throughout the province will account for 65% of the total number of farmer households in the province. The number of farmer households joining the cooperatives in key areas should reach 75.8% of the total number of local farmer households.

    新疆、浙江、热河、广东等地
    全面规划农业合作化工作
    本报讯  为迎接农业合作化运动的新高潮，新疆、浙江、热河、广东等地都全面规划了农业合作化工作。
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会根据新疆第三届党代表会议精神和新疆互助合作运动发展情况，制定出新疆农业合作化的全面规划。按照这一规划，新疆农业地区到一九六零年即可基本合作化。新疆现有农业生产合作社一千七百零二个，新制定出的规划要求一九五六年再建三千四百六十九个。入社农户将占总农户百分之十七以上。一九五七年新建社五千零九十六个，连老社共达一万零二百六十七个，入社农户占总农户百分之三十六点四一。到一九六零年，全疆农业社预计将发展到一万八千个。入社农户占总农户百分之八十五。在即将到来的农业合作化运动高潮面前，各族农民建社情绪很高。申请转社和建社的越来越多。
    浙江省目前已有两千一百多个乡进行农业合作化的全面规划工作。这些乡的中共支部已制定或正在制定全乡合作化和发展农业生产的全面规划。在规划过程中，各地贫农、下中农得到了很大的鼓舞，大多数都迫切要求入社。现在有些乡已结合整顿原有的农业生产合作社扩大老社和建立新社。到十月上旬，嘉兴、温州、宁波、金华等专区已建成和正在建立的共有六千五百多个新社，两千七百多个老社也在吸收新社员，十万零三千多户贫农、下中农加入了农业生产合作社。浙江省各地进行合作化全面规划典型试验的三百多个乡在九月份先后结束工作后，各地党委都认真总结了这些乡的经验。中共浙江省委员会也召开会议，研究进行典型试验的乡的经验教训，并在全省各乡分批进行合作化全面规划工作。
    中共热河省委员会和各县、旗委员会在九月份都作了合作化全面规划的典型试验工作。在进行典型试验的村（相当于关内的乡）中，有些是合作化运动开展较好的，有些是互助合作基础较差的，也有些是农户居住分散的山村。经过规划，各种类型村的合作化运动都更加健康地发展起来。仅据二十个村的统计，今冬准备加入老社和建立新社的农户，就比各村老社原有农户总数增加一倍以上。这些村的中共支部在规划后都心中有数，领导合作化运动的积极性大大提高。当前，各村支部正根据规划，领导农民筹备建社和扩社。
    中共广东省委员会在最近修订全省农业合作化全面规划时，着重检查和部署了主要产粮区、经济作物区和其他重点地区发展农业生产合作社的工作。省委在检查中特别强调了今后合作化的发展要贯彻“全面铺开，重点地区先合作化”的方针。修订后的全面规划确定：广东省农业合作社经过今秋到明春的发展后，入社农户将占全省农户总数的百分之三十三。在上述重点地区，入社农户要发展到当地农户总数的百分之三十七点四。到一九五七年，全省入社农户将占全省农户总数的百分之六十五。重点地区入社农户要达到当地农户总数的百分之七十五点八。
