Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, October 28th:

Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen,

This meeting is convened according to the decision of the four-government heads. Its task is to discuss the issues mentioned in the instructions agreed upon at the Geneva Conference.

It is now generally recognized that the government heads meeting held in Geneva in July has great historical significance. It has helped ease international tensions, especially in relations between major powers. It reflects the desire of people of all countries to end the so-called "Cold War." It further strengthened the will of the people of all countries to achieve a solid and lasting peace. It paves the way for jointly considering and resolving pressing world issues in the spirit of mutual understanding and respect for the interests of all parties concerned and in accordance with the needs of seeking international peace.

The Soviet government highly appreciates the positive results achieved at the government heads meeting and the significant contributions made by President Eisenhower, Prime Minister Eden, and Premier Faure to the success of the meeting.

There was a time when some people made comments trying to obscure the positive results of the Geneva Conference. This is something we still need to remember. It shows that there are considerable obstacles on the road to achieving the goals set by the Geneva Conference. However, we believe that we all share the common hope of consolidating the achievements of the Geneva Conference and continuing to work on this basis.

Our meeting will be closely watched all over the world. Millions of people expect that as a result of this meeting, further progress will be made in developing cooperation between countries, easing international tensions, and consolidating world peace.

All of this places definite responsibilities on those of us attending the meeting.

Since the Geneva Conference, the Soviet government has taken new steps to promote the easing of tensions in international relations. These new steps have been applauded worldwide.

The first thing I want to mention is the Soviet Union's decision to reduce its armed forces by 640,000 men. In making this decision, the Soviet Union has practically demonstrated its willingness to actively promote the end of the arms race and its hope for further easing international tensions. Everyone also knows that the governments of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania have also reduced their armed forces.

The Soviet Union has recently decided to abandon the Porkkala Peninsula naval base on Finnish territory before the stipulated deadline. The Soviet Union did this even though the Finnish peace treaty stipulates that the Soviet Union could continue to maintain this base until 1997. In this way, the Soviet Union this year abolished the Lüshun Port naval base on Chinese territory and the naval base on Finnish territory—the two naval bases that the Soviet Union maintained on foreign territory. The Soviet Union no longer possesses any military bases outside its borders. These steps by the Soviet government are also sufficient to further strengthen friendly relations with the countries concerned. These steps have been widely praised and are considered an example of solving the pressing international problem of major powers maintaining military bases on foreign territory.

After the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union established diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. The Treaty on Relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic has been concluded and has entered into force. The normal relations between the Soviet Union and the two countries existing on German territory will undoubtedly help to ease international tensions in the heart of Europe and have a good influence on the resolution of the German problem.

In taking all these steps and developing the Soviet Union's ties and cooperation with Eastern and Western countries, the Soviet government is following the principle that actions are needed to support words in international affairs; that we should not stop in the face of unresolved problems, but move forward step by step, and prepare the conditions for solving other more complex problems.

The steps taken by the Soviet Union show that there are still great possibilities for further easing international tensions that have not yet been exploited. Of course, this requires all countries—especially major powers—to act in the spirit of Geneva. Unfortunately, far from everyone is taking advantage of this possibility.

Our meeting faces the task of continuing the good work begun by the Geneva government heads meeting. This task determines our main goals.

The government heads instructed us to discuss the following items: First, European security and the German issue; second, the disarmament issue; third, the issue of developing contacts between East and West.

The four heads of government—Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin, President Eisenhower, Prime Minister Eden, and Premier Faure—have unanimously pointed out the great significance of the first item on the agenda—European security and the German issue. The reason for doing so is obvious. Both World War I and World War II started in Europe. These wars, provoked by militarist Germany, brought unspeakable suffering and destruction to European countries, which have not yet recovered. The peoples of the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, France, Belgium, and other European countries attacked by the German militarist army suffered particularly heavily. We also know the considerable losses suffered by the German people due to these wars; due to the war-mongering policies pursued by the German aggressive militarist groups, the German people have been forced to pay a heavy price.

In view of this historical lesson and the need to establish some guarantee to ensure the peaceful and tranquil life of European countries, we should do everything possible to strive for success in achieving European security, which is of vital concern to all European countries.

At the Geneva Conference in July, the Soviet government put forward its own proposals on this issue. Undoubtedly, if an appropriate agreement can be reached on this issue, it will best help consolidate peace and European security. The Soviet government proposed that all relevant European countries and the United States of America conclude a pan-European treaty guaranteeing collective European security. The heads of government decided to submit the draft treaty we proposed to the foreign ministers for consideration. When discussing this issue, the Soviet delegation will present arguments to support the aforementioned proposal.

However, it should be pointed out now that the main obstacle to European security is the existence of military blocs. In this regard, the North Atlantic Group initiated it. These groups set some countries against each other and stimulate the arms race. They increase the danger of new wars.

The Soviet Union is in favor of abolishing military blocs. If for some reason this cannot be done immediately, we suggest doing it gradually, but we should pave the way for abolishing all military groups and combinations now.

All steps aimed at easing international tensions and strengthening trust between countries are in line with this goal.

We must consider the German question, which is subordinate to this question, in connection with the main problem facing European countries—the European security question. So far, the Soviet Union has always been in favor of resolving the German question based on the interests of European security and reunifying Germany along peaceful and democratic lines. We believe that in resolving the German question, reliable guarantees should be put forward so that German militarism will not rise again to threaten the peace and tranquility of European countries. This is the only way to solve the problem of German reunification that is both in the interests of European countries and in the interests of the German people themselves.

Therefore, when considering the German question, the question inevitably arises as to which direction a unified Germany will develop—will it still become a militarist country and join the military bloc organized by Western countries, or will it become a peaceful and democratic country that stands outside any military bloc and works with other countries to consolidate peace.

Now, the remilitarization of West Germany has actually begun on the basis of the Paris Accords, and it has joined the Western military bloc, and new obstacles have arisen on the road to resolving the German question.

Under the current circumstances, a proper solution can only be gradually reached by easing international tensions in Europe, establishing a reliable collective security system, and as a result of reconciliation and better cooperation between the two parts of Germany.

Recently, some people have said that the solution to European security and the German problem should be achieved gradually. This opinion should not be opposed, as long as it is for the purpose of achieving true European security and rebuilding German unity along peaceful and democratic lines.

However, if, under the guise of gradually unifying Germany, militarism is in fact gradually revived throughout Germany, then these goals cannot be achieved through such a solution to the German problem. German militarism, whether it is revived once or gradually revived, must never be accepted.

On the other hand, under the current circumstances, since there are two Germanys with different social systems, the solution to the German problem should not be sought at the expense of the interests of any part of Germany, or at the expense of the achievements of social construction by the working people of the German Democratic Republic—this is crucial to all German people. It is very unrealistic to try to achieve the unification of Germany through mechanically merging the two parts of Germany.

At the same time, we cannot but take into account that the solution to the German question is first and foremost a matter for the Germans themselves. Our task is only to assist them in this matter, and not to force them to accept our plan or that plan.

The disarmament issue is one of the most important issues at this meeting, and the people of all countries are looking forward to a satisfactory solution to this issue. It is true that the people of all countries regard the current arms expansion as one of the main reasons for the current tension and distrust in international relations. Arms expansion consumes a large amount of manpower and material resources in peaceful construction, making the tax burden and the burden of rising prices on the shoulders of the people of all countries heavier and heavier. No one should underestimate this point. At the same time, the people of all countries hope to use the funds now used for arms expansion to improve the lives of the people and assist backward countries and backward regions.

The main task in discussing the disarmament issue is to find a way to stop arms expansion, reduce the huge armed forces (land, sea, and air forces) of all countries, prohibit atomic weapons, and save mankind from the threat of atomic war. To solve this task, it is only possible under the following conditions: all countries, especially the major powers, greatly reduce their armaments, implement measures to prohibit atomic weapons, so that such a great achievement of human wisdom and technology as the discovery and use of atomic energy is only used for peaceful needs. Of course, there must be strict international supervision and effective inspection organizations for the implementation of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. However, if, while talking about supervision and inspection, we continue to expand armaments, accumulate atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, and expand military budgets, then it is not convincing.

As everyone knows, on May 10 this year, the Soviet government put forward detailed proposals on disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of new wars. In subsequent statements, the Soviet government noted the opinions of Western countries that also aimed at achieving disarmament. It can be said that on many important issues concerning disarmament—on the level of armaments and armed forces, on the procedures and timing of the prohibition of atomic weapons, and on some important aspects of international supervision in this regard, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France have now reached a great degree of agreement. At the same time, it should be pointed out that the correspondence between U.S. President Eisenhower and Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin has helped to further clarify the attitudes of both sides on certain important aspects of the disarmament issue.

The disarmament issue requires practical steps and requires decisions. The Soviet delegation is prepared to welcome all proposals that can promote the cessation of arms expansion and make progress on the disarmament issue.

The Soviet government also attaches great importance to the issue of East-West contacts to be discussed at this meeting, as such contacts will help promote international cooperation and better mutual understanding.

We know that the development of contacts between East and West will be successful as long as this development has a solid economic foundation and relies on the unimpeded development of international trade. However, at present, this is hindered by discrimination against international trade, the destruction of normal relations in terms of credit, and other artificial measures that hinder international cooperation.

It would be good if agreements could be reached on developing international ties in the fields of culture, science, and technology, and on developing measures for travel, as well as on measures for exchanging experience in industry, agriculture, and trade. We believe that there are not small possibilities in developing such international relations.

Finally, allow me to express my hope that our meeting will be conducted in a spirit of striving for mutual understanding and willingness to cooperate, a spirit that once enveloped the Geneva four-government heads meeting and has promoted the easing of international tensions and the cause of consolidating peace. We will achieve positive results on this road that are in line with the wishes of our peoples.

### 十月二十七日在日内瓦四国外长会议上  莫洛托夫的发言

专栏：

    十月二十七日在日内瓦四国外长会议上 
    莫洛托夫的发言主席先生，诸位先生，
    这次会议是根据四国政府首脑的决定而召开的。它的任务是讨论日内瓦会议上商定的指示中提到的问题。
    现在人们都公认七月间在日内瓦举行的政府首脑会议具有重大的历史重要性。它已经有助于缓和国际紧张局势，特别是在大国间的关系方面。它反映了各国人民要求结束所谓“冷战”的愿望。它更进一步加强了各国人民要求取得稳固和持久的和平的意愿。它为本着相互谅解和尊重有关各方的利益的精神并按照谋求国际和平的需要而来共同考虑和解决迫切的世界问题铺平了道路。
    苏联政府对政府首脑会议获得的积极成果以及艾森豪威尔总统、艾登首相和富尔总理对会议的成功所作的重大贡献都给予高度评价。
    曾经一度有人发表议论，想要掩盖日内瓦会议的积极成果。这是我们仍然需要记住的。这说明，在达到日内瓦会议所规定的目标的路途上有着相当多的障碍。然而，我们认为我们大家都共同希望巩固日内瓦会议所获得的成果并且在这个基础上继续进行工作。
    世界一切地方都将密切地注意我们的会议。千千万万人民都盼望由于这次会议的结果在发展各国间的合作、缓和国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平方面将取得进一步的进展。
    所有这一切把确定的责任加在我们出席会议的人身上。
    自从日内瓦会议以来，苏联政府已经采取了新的步骤来促进国际关系中的紧张局势的缓和。这些新步骤受到了全世界的赞许。
    我要提起的第一件事情就是苏联裁减武装部队六十四万人的决定。苏联作出这项决定就实际表现了它愿意积极促成军备竞赛的结束和希望进一步缓和国际紧张局势。大家也知道，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚的政府也都裁减了它们的武装部队。
    苏联最近已经决定在规定的期限以前放弃在芬兰领土上的波卡拉半岛海军基地。虽然对芬和约规定苏联可以继续保有这个基地到一九九七年，苏联还是这样做了。就这样，苏联在今年取消了在中国领土上的旅顺港海军基地和在芬兰领土上的海军基地——这是苏联在外国领土上保有的两个海军基地。苏联现在在它的边界以外再不拥有任何军事基地了。苏联政府的这些步骤还足以进一步加强同有关国家的友好关系。这些步骤广泛地受到了赞许，被认为是解决大国在外国领土上保有军事基地这个迫切的国际问题的一个范例。
    在日内瓦会议以后，苏联同德意志联邦共和国建立了外交关系。苏联和德意志民主共和国关系条约已经缔结，并且已经生效。苏联和存在于德国领土上的两个国家之间的正常关系无疑将有助于缓和欧洲中心地带的国际紧张局势，并且对解决德国问题有良好的影响。
    在采取这一切步骤和发展苏联同东方和西方国家的联系和合作时，苏联政府是遵循这样的原则的：在国际事务中需要用行动来支持言词；不要在没有解决的问题面前停止下来，而要一步一步前进，并且为解决其他更加复杂的问题准备条件。
    苏联所采取的步骤说明：现在存在着仍然没有被利用的进一步缓和国际紧张局势的巨大可能性，当然，这需要所有的国家——特别是大国——按照日内瓦精神行事。不幸的是远不是每个人都在利用这种可能性。
    我们的会议面临着继续进行日内瓦政府首脑会议所开始的良好的工作的任务。这项任务决定了我们的主要目标。
    政府首脑们指示我们讨论下列项目：一，欧洲安全和德国问题；二，裁军问题；三，发展东西方之间的接触问题。
    四国政府首脑——布尔加宁部长会议主席、艾森豪威尔总统、艾登首相和富尔总理——已经一致指出第一项议程——欧洲安全和德国问题的巨大重要意义。这样作的理由是很明显的。第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战都是在欧洲开始的。军国主义的德国所挑起的这些战争给欧洲各国带来了说不尽的苦难和破坏，直到现在还没有恢复过来。苏联各族人民，波兰、南斯拉夫、捷克斯洛伐克、法国、比利时及其他受到德国军国主义军队的进攻的欧洲国家的人民所受到的苦难特别深重。我们也知道德国人民由于这些战争所遭到的相当巨大的损失；由于德国侵略性军国主义集团所奉行的战争冒险政策，德国人民曾经被迫付出沉重的代价。
    鉴于这种历史教训和建立某种保障办法保证欧洲国家的和平和安宁的生活的必要性，我们应该尽
  一切力量争取在实现欧洲的安全方面得到成功，这对于所有欧洲国家说来都是切身有关的事情。
    在七月间的日内瓦会议上，苏联政府提出了自己关于这个问题的建议。不容置疑，如果能在这个问题上达成适当的协议，那将能最好地帮助巩固和平和欧洲安全。苏联政府建议由一切有关的欧洲国家和美利坚合众国缔结一项保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约。政府首脑们决定把我们提出的条约草案交给外长们考虑。在讨论到这个问题的时候，苏联代表团将提出论据来支持上述的建议。
    但是，现在就应该指出，欧洲安全的主要障碍是军事集团的存在。这方面是由北大西洋集团开头的。这些集团使得一些国家互相对立起来，并且刺激着军备竞赛。它们增加了发生新战争的危险。
    苏联赞成废除军事集团。如果为了某些原因不能立即这样做的话，我们建议逐步进行这件事，但是现在就应该为废除一切军事的集团和组合铺平道路。
    一切目的在于缓和国际紧张局势和加强各国之间的信任的步骤都符合于这个目的。
    我们要跟欧洲国家所面临的主要问题——欧洲安全问题联系起来来考虑从属于这个问题的德国问题。至今为止，苏联一直赞成根据欧洲安全的利益来解决德国问题，并且循着和平和民主的方针重新统一德国。我们认为，在解决德国问题时应该提出可靠的保证，从而使德国军国主义不致再度起来威胁欧洲国家的和平和安宁。这是唯一能够既符合欧洲国家的利益也符合德国人民本身的利益的解决德国重新统一问题的办法。
    因此，在考虑德国问题时就不可避免地产生了关于统一后的德国将向哪一个方向发展的问题——还是使它变成一个军国主义国家并且加入西方国家所组织的军事集团呢，还是使它成为一个置身于任何军事集团以外、同其他国家共同致力于巩固和平的和平和民主的国家。
    现在，西德的重新军国主义化实际上已经在巴黎协定的基础上开始实行，它已经参加了西方的军事集团，解决德国问题的道路上已经产生了新的障碍。
    在目前情况下，只有通过缓和欧洲国际紧张局势、建立可靠的集体安全体系，并且作为德国两个部分修好和进行较好的合作的结果，才能逐步达成适当的解决。
    近来有人说欧洲安全和德国问题的解决应当逐步实现。不应当反对这个意见，只要它是为了达到真正的欧洲安全和循着和平和民主方针来重建德国的统一。
    但是，如果在逐步统一德国的幌子下，事实上让军国主义逐步在全德国复活，那末，通过这样一个解决德国问题的办法，这些目的是达不到的。德国军国主义无论是一次复活或逐步复活，都是绝不能予以接受的。
    另方面，在目前情况下，既存在有社会制度不同的两个德国，不应当在牺牲德国任何一部分的利益、牺牲德意志民主共和国劳动人民的社会建设成就——这对全体德国人民是至关重要的——的情况下谋求德国问题的解决。要试图通过德国两部分机械地实行合并的方式达到德国的统一，那是十分不现实的。
    同时，我们不能不考虑到，解决德国问题首先是德国人自己的事，我们的任务只是在这个问题上协助他们，而不是强迫他们接受我们的这一套或那一套计划。
    裁军问题是我们这次会议上的一个最重要的问题，各国人民都期待这个问题的完满解决。各国人民把现在进行的扩充军备看成是产生当前紧张局势和国际关系中不信任的主要原因之一，这是不错的。扩充军备消耗了和平建设中的大量的人力和物力，使各国人民肩上的赋税负担和物价上涨的负担越来越沉重。谁都不应该对这一点估计不足。同时，各国人民希望把现在用于扩充军备的资金用来提高人民的生活以及援助落后国家和落后地区。
    在讨论裁军问题时的主要任务就是寻找一种办法来停止扩充军备，裁减各国庞大的武装部队（陆、海、空军）以及禁止原子武器和使人类免受原子战争的威胁。要解决这一任务，只有在下述条件下才有可能：各国、首先是大国大大地裁减军备，实行禁止原子武器的措施，以使像发现利用原子能方法的这样一种人类智慧和技术上的伟大成就只用在和平需要上。当然，对实行裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施必须有严格的国际监督和有效的检查组织。但是，如果一面在谈监督和检查，一面继续在扩充军备，积累原子弹和氢弹，扩大军事预算，那就不能令人信服了。
    大家知道，今年五月十日苏联政府提出了关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁的详细建议。苏联政府在以后的声明中注意到西方国家也以实现裁军为目的的那些意见。可以说，在关于裁军的许多重要问题上——在关于军备和武装部队的水平、关于禁止原子武器的程序和时期、关于这方面的国际监督的某些重要方面，苏联、美国、英国和法国之间现在已经取得了很大程度的协议。同时应该指出，美国总统艾森豪威尔和苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁之间的通信有助于进一步澄清双方对裁军问题的某些重要方面所采取的态度。
    裁军问题要求采取实际的步骤，要求作出决定。苏联代表团准备欢迎一切能够促进停止扩充军备和使裁军问题取得进展的建议。
    苏联政府还非常重视在这次会议上要讨论东西方接触的问题，因为这种接触会有助于促进国际合作和更好的互相谅解。
    我们知道，发展东西方之间的接触是会获得成就的，只要这种发展有着牢固的经济基础和依靠着国际贸易的毫无阻碍的发展。但是目前在这方面受着对国际贸易的歧视、信用方面正常关系的破坏以及妨碍国际合作的其他人为措施的阻挠。
    如果能就发展文化、科学和技术方面的国际联系和发展旅行方面的措施以及就在工业、农业和贸易方面交换经验的措施达成协议，那是很好的。我们认为，在发展这种国际关系方面有着不小的可能性。
    最后请允许我表示自己的希望：我们的会议将本着致力于取得互相谅解和准备合作的精神进行，这种精神曾经笼罩在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上，并且曾经促进了国际紧张局势的缓和和巩固和平的事业。我们将在这条道路上获得符合我们各国人民愿望的积极结果。
