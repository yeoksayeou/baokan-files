    Relying on the Hands of Youth
    Soviet Union　S. Garbuzov

    It was a clear March day, a beautiful day in early spring. The fierce wind still stung the cheeks, but water was already dripping from the roofs, and the azure sky indicated the end of winter.

    Groups of young men and women, or individuals, walked out of the gates of the Kremlin and came to Red Square. Their faces were red, not only from the wind. The brilliance in the eyes of hundreds of people could be compared to sunlight. The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party had just delivered a farewell speech to them on the podium in the Kremlin hall. The motherland was dispatching brave young people to participate in the glorious labor battle, to participate in the great labor expedition.

    In a few days, these young men and women could be seen in trains decorated with slogans and garlands heading east. The first batch of settlers, the future conquerors of the wasteland, were going to Kazakhstan, Siberia, Altai, and the east bank of the Volga River...

    ...Sometimes this happens, a word that we have long been familiar with suddenly seems to be brand new. Its sound is different, and you can discover a new, hidden meaning within it. Not long ago, an old Russian word—"wasteland"—underwent such a transformation.

    This word refers to uncultivated land. Until recently, it was mainly encountered in specialized agronomic books. But now, the word "wasteland" has become a common term for all Soviet people. It appears in songs, in newspaper headlines, and outstanding film masters are producing films titled "Wasteland." Because one of the most glorious pages in the history of the Soviet state will henceforth be forever linked to this word. This page is being written by the hands of our contemporaries, mainly young people, right before our eyes.

    The entire activity of the Communist Party and the entire policy of the Soviet government are permeated with concern for the people's happiness. The purpose of socialist production is to satisfy the growing material and cultural needs of citizens on the basis of adopting new technologies. This is the basic law of the socialist economy: in order to make the country stronger and to increase the welfare of the workers year by year, we must first strive to develop heavy industry—the production of fuel, power, metals, and machines. Only on this basis can all other economic sectors be developed, including agriculture, the national granary that supplies food to residents and raw materials to light industry.

    This is how the Communist Party, the tested helmsman of the Soviet state, acts. Relying on the power of socialist industry, the Party and the government have formulated a series of fundamental measures to rapidly improve agriculture. The most important of these is the reclamation of virgin and fallow land. There is an especially large amount of this land, which has never been touched by plows, in the east of the Soviet Union, in the vast expanses of Western Siberia, one of the largest lowlands in the world, in the Volga River Basin, and in the steppes of Kazakhstan. In the eastern fourteen states of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the northern eight states of Kazakhstan alone, the area of virgin and fallow land, dry valley hayfields and pastures, reaches forty million hectares. From 1954 to 1955, the area sown with grain was to be expanded by thirteen million hectares by means of reclaiming wasteland. This historically significant task was proposed at the February-March Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee last year.

    What is needed to accomplish this task? We need powerful machines that can plow, cultivate, and sow large areas of land in a short period of time, we need people who can learn to operate these machines in a short period of time, and we need people who are determined to devote all their energy to reclaiming uninhabited places.

    Socialist industry supplied the machines used in the wasteland. In 1954 alone, the Soviet state supplied machine tractor stations and state farms in the wasteland reclamation areas with 115,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 18,000 grain combines, and thousands of plows, cultivators, seeders, and other equipment. And the Communist Party's faithful assistant, our Lenin Communist Youth League, which has won four orders, provided the people, the masters of the machines, the transformers of the new, vast land.

    The call came from Moscow, and the people of Leningrad also joined in. Following the people of Leningrad were the people of Sverdlovsk, the Ukrainians... In a few days, on the tables of the Communist Youth League committees of various factories and institutions, there were already bundles of applications from young patriotic volunteers to conquer the wasteland. Each of them originally had a job, a home, friends, and accustomed living conditions. But they asked to go to the steppes, to tents and mobile homes, even though they knew that the initial period would not be easy, that they would have to endure many hardships and overcome many difficulties. What attracted them? What motivated them? It was the ardent sense of social and civic responsibility of our youth, cultivated by the Communist Party, the ardent desire to bring more benefits to the motherland, and the ardent desire to examine, test, and temper their strength and will.

    This fine tradition of our youth, of going to places that are more difficult and more needed by the motherland, has developed and strengthened at every stage of the revolution. Where the broad streets of the youth city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur now stretch out over the Heilongjiang River, the original large forest was cleared by the hands of young people. When our East established a strong industrial base and built giant metallurgical factories—the Magnitogorsk and Kuznetsk integrated plants—thousands of Komsomol members responded to the call of the Communist Party to come to the construction sites. The poet Mayakovsky mentioned them in his inspiring poem: I know—the city will appear! I know—hundreds of flowers will bloom! Because there are such people in the Soviet land!

    Among the builders of Komsomolsk-on-Amur was a young carpenter named Nikolai Chernovalov. More than twenty years later, Nikolai Fedorovich Chernovalov, together with his sons Nikolai and Vladimir, went to Altai to reclaim wasteland. Father and sons advanced in the same team. The father's banner was entrusted to reliable hands!

    The applications of those applying to participate in wasteland reclamation were carefully reviewed. The Communist Youth League permit was only issued to those who were known and trusted by the collective. Last year, 150,000 patriotic youth received this permit. The main burden of the initial work fell on their young shoulders.

    They gloriously fulfilled this task. The young people who moved in, under the leadership of veteran Party members, completed the tasks assigned to them hand in hand with the thousands of experts sent by the Party to the wasteland. The plan for reclaiming new land was greatly exceeded. This enabled the Party and the government to revise the initial estimates and set new milestones on the road to reclaiming wasteland: by 1956, twenty-eight million to thirty million hectares were to be plowed and sown. This number is roughly equal to the total arable land area of France and Italy, two large European countries.

    What can reclaiming virgin and fallow land bring to the Soviet people? Let us first cite some general figures to illustrate:

    Even if only ten quintals of grain are harvested from each hectare of wasteland (the harvest on the wasteland often exceeds this figure by two times), the entire Soviet Union can harvest 300 million quintals. This means that there will be much more grain than at present, which can be used to feed livestock and turn grain into meat, milk, and other livestock products. The country's grain reserves will also be expanded. The Soviet state can also strengthen its assistance to other countries. For example, it can help Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic, which do not have enough grain. It can also expand the sown area of industrial raw material crops in Ukraine, for example, grow more sugar beets to produce more sugar.

    Now let us turn from general figures to local figures. The collective farms in the Pavlodar District of Pavlodar State reclaimed 35,000 hectares of wasteland last year. They earned 36 million rubles just by selling grain to the state according to the purchasing system. All the collective farms here have become "millionaires." The "May 1st" collective farm in the Rogin District of Altai Territory added 4,600 hectares of new land to its agricultural operation, harvested 1.3 million poods of grain, and thus expanded the farm's income to 15 million rubles!

    The great economic and political significance of reclaiming wasteland is so obvious and clear that this cause has become a truly nationwide undertaking. When the call "We want to send new teams of young patriots to reclaim wasteland!" was issued this year, the number of people who wanted to go to the wasteland was far greater than the number of people who needed to be sent.

    There, on the steppes of Kazakhstan and Altai, on the plains of Western Siberia, new teams of Communist Youth League members met the first pioneers in the wasteland. These "old residents"—as they proudly call themselves—showed their comrades how much work they had already done in this period of no more than ten to eleven months.

    In April 1954, when a team of Communist Youth League members from Red Presnya got out of the car and stepped onto the muddy, damp ground here, only the wind was blowing among the sparse birch forests scattered across the desolate steppe. The nearest residential area was a hundred kilometers away. But now, this place is a long street of new houses composed of two-room apartments, called Komsomol Street. The engine is roaring in the repair shop. A line of cars is parked near Binzokoloika. The billboard next to the club has film previews. A notice near the dining hall says: Registration has begun for children entering the state farm school.

    Along the road leading to "their own" state farm, a new group of Red Presnya people came to their comrades. After seeing what had been done and achieved here in a year, they solemnly declared: Not only catch up, but also surpass!

    In the Red Presnya State Farm, the tractor team of Vasily Skripka is very famous. It firmly holds the mobile red flag. And in the team, the first place belongs to the tractor driver Vasily Galinin. No one in the state farm plows more or sows more than him. A year ago, Vasily Galinin worked in a shoe factory in Moscow, adjusting automatic machine tools. His wife, Valentina, also worked on such a machine tool. Now, the former worker has become a real tractor driver, and his wife has become an excellent hooking machine operator. They have already established their own business—they have planted a vegetable garden and are also raising a pig. They have settled down in the new land.

    According to the decision of the All-Union Communist Youth League Central Committee, Vasily Galinin was awarded the "Reclaiming Wasteland" medal. Galinin will soon be going to Moscow, because he has been approved to participate in the 1955 All-Union Agricultural Exhibition.

    Vasily Savalishen, a Red Presnya Communist Youth League member, came to the wasteland a year later than Galinin and Skripka. However, after seeing their achievements and learning from their experience, he bravely proposed a competition to the glorious conquerors of the new land.

    Vasily Savalishen, along with other Red Presnya people who came to the wasteland in 1955, worked at the "Railway" State Farm. He leads a young tractor team. A few days ago, the Red Presnya District Communist Youth League District Committee received a letter with good news: The "newcomers" have caught up with the "old-timers." In terms of the number of hectares plowed, Vasily Savalishen's tractor drivers have caught up with Vasily Skripka's tractor drivers.

    ...The residents of the steppe say that they can no longer recognize this place that they have known since childhood. Flat, straight roads cross the steppe, and the roads lead to bustling state farm villages. At night, the steppe is full of lights—as if the stars of the sky are scattered on the earth. These are thousands of tractor drivers working. Bridges have been built over the rivers. The roadbeds have been raised, and rails are being laid on them. When autumn comes, the harvest transport teams—the transport teams of grain produced on the new land by the diligent hands of young people—will rush westward along the new roads and new railways.

    靠着青年的手 
    苏联　斯·加尔布佐夫
    是清朗的三月天，初春的一个美好的日子。烈风还刺痛着面颊，可是从屋顶已经滴下水来，蔚蓝的天空也说明冬天是结束了。
    青年男女成群地或单独地走出克里姆林宫的大门，来到红场。他们的脸变红了，这不仅是因为风吹的缘故。几百只眼睛的光辉可以同阳光相比。党中央委员会的第一书记，刚才在克里姆林宫大厅的讲台上向他们说了送行的话。祖国派遣了勇敢的年轻人去参加光荣的劳动战斗，去参加伟大的和劳动的远征。
    几天以后，就可以在装饰着标语和花环的奔向东方的列车里，看到这些男女青年了。第一批迁居者、未来的荒地征服者的队伍，到哈萨克斯坦、西伯利亚、阿尔泰和伏尔加河东岸去了……
    ……有时有这种情况，我们很早就熟悉的一个字眼好像突然间焕然一新。它的声音听来已经不同，你能从它里面发现一种新的、隐秘的意义。不久以前，俄罗斯的一个老字眼——“荒地”就发生了这样的变化。
    这个字眼是指未曾翻耕的土地。一直到最近，还主要是在专门的农学书籍中才遇到它。而现在，
  “荒地”这个字已是全体苏联人的口头语了。它在歌曲中、在报纸的标题中出现，优秀的电影大师摄制着名为“荒地”的影片。因为苏维埃国家历史上最光荣的篇幅之一，要从此永远同这个字眼联系在一起。这一页是我们眼看着由我们同时代的人，主要是青年人的手写起来的。
    共产党的全部活动，苏联政府的整个政策，都贯穿着对人民幸福的关怀。社会主义生产的目的，就是在采用新技术的基础上来满足公民日益增长的物质和文化需要。社会主义经济的基本规律就是这样，为了使国家更巩固，为了使劳动者的福利一年年地增长，首先应当尽力发展重工业——燃料、动力、金属、机器的生产。只有在这个基础上才能发展其他一切经济部门，其中也包括农业这个供给居民粮食、供给轻工业原料的全民仓库。
    共产党，苏维埃国家的经过考验的舵手，就是这样行动的。党和政府依靠着社会主义工业的威力，制定了一系列迅速提高农业的根本措施。其中最重要的就是开垦生荒地和熟荒地。这些犁头未曾触动过的土地，在苏联东部、在世界上最大的低地之一——西部西伯利亚的广阔地带，在伏尔加河流域和哈萨克斯坦的草原，特别多。仅在俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国东部的十四个州和哈萨克斯坦北部的八个州内，生荒地和熟荒地，干谷地的割草场和牧场的面积，就达到四千万公顷。从一九五四年到一九五五年，要用开垦荒地的办法把谷物的播种面积扩大一千三百万公顷。这项具有历史意义的任务是去年党中央委员会的二—三月全会提出来的。
    要完成这项任务，需要有什么呢？需要有能够在短期间翻耕、耕作和播种大片土地的强有力的机器，需要有能在短期间学会操纵这些机器的人，需要有决心把全部精力贡献给开垦荒无人烟的地方的人。
    社会主义工业供给了荒地上用的机器。仅在一九五四年，苏维埃国家就供给开荒地区的机器拖拉机站和国营农场十一万五千部拖拉机（每部以十五马力计算），一万八千部谷物联合收割机，数以千计的犁、中耕机、播种机和其他设备。而共产党的忠实助手，我们那曾获得四次勋章的列宁共产主义青年团，则提供了人，机器的主人，新的辽阔土地的改造者。
    莫斯科人发出了号召，列宁格勒人也参加了。跟在列宁格勒人后边的还有斯维德洛夫斯克人、乌克兰人……。几天以后，在各工厂和机关的共青团委员会的桌子上，已经有了成捆的青年爱国者申请去征服荒地的志愿书。他们每个人原来都有工作、住宅、朋友和习惯了的生活条件。但是他们要求到草原去，到帐篷和宿营车里去，虽然他们知道初期是不容易的，需要忍受许多困苦，需要克服许多困难。是什么吸引着他们呢？是什么推动着他们呢？是共产党所培养成的我国青年的热烈的社会责任感和公民责任感，是使祖国得到更多利益的热烈愿望，以及要检查、考验和锻炼自己的力量和意志的热烈愿望。
    我国青年的这个到较困难的和祖国更需要的地方去的优良传统，在革命的各阶段发展和巩固起来了。在黑龙江上现在伸展着青年城市共青团城的宽阔街道的地方，原有的大森林就是青年们的手清除掉的。当我国的东方建立强大的工业基地，建筑冶金业的巨大工厂——马格尼托哥尔斯克和库兹涅茨克联合工厂的时候，数以千计的共青团员就曾响应共产党的号召来到建筑工地。诗人马雅可夫斯基在他的鼓舞人的诗篇中曾提到过他们：我知道——城市会出现！我知道——百花会开放！因为在苏维埃的国土上有这样的人们！
    在黑龙江上的共青团城的建设者中间，有过一个年轻的木匠尼古拉·切尔诺瓦洛夫。二十多年以后，尼古拉·费道罗维奇·切尔诺瓦洛夫同着儿子尼古拉和弗拉基米尔又到阿尔泰去开垦荒地。父亲和儿子在一个队伍里前进。父亲的旗帜交付到了可靠的人的手里！
    对申请参加开荒的人的申请书，是经过严格审查的。共青团的许可证只发给那为集体所了解和信任的人。去年，十五万爱国青年得到了这种许可证。初期工作的主要重担就落在他们的年轻的肩膀上。
    他们光荣地执行了这个任务。迁居来的青年人，在党员老同志的领导下，同党派到荒地上来的数千专家手携手地完成了交给他们的任务。开垦新地的计划大大超过了。这使党和政府能够重新审订最初所做的估计，并在开垦荒地的道路上设置新的路标：到一九五六年，要翻耕和播种二千八百万公顷到三千万公顷。这个数目大约等于法国和意大利这两个欧洲大国全部耕地面积的总和。
    开垦生荒地和熟荒地，能给苏联人民一些什么呢？让我们首先引一些总的数字来说明：
    从每一公顷荒地即使只收获十公担谷物（荒地上的收获量时常超过这个数字两倍），全苏联即可收获三亿公担。这就是说，能有较目前多得多的谷物，可以用来饲养牲畜，把谷物变成肉、奶和其他畜产品。国家的粮食储备量也会扩大。苏维埃国家还能加强对其他国家的帮助。例如，可以帮助谷物不够用的捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国。也可以扩大乌克兰的工业原料作物的播种面积，例如，可以多种一些糖萝卜，以生产更多的糖。
    现在我们再从总的数字转向局部的数字。帕福洛达尔州的帕福洛达尔区的各个集体农庄，去年开垦了三万五千公顷荒地。它们仅是按收购制把谷物交售给国家，就获得了三千六百万卢布。这里所有的集体农庄都成为“百万富翁”了。阿尔泰边疆区罗金区的“五一”集体农庄，在农业经营中加上了四千六百公顷新地，收获了一百三十万普特粮食，从而把农庄的收入扩大到一千五百万卢布！
    开垦荒地在经济和政治上的重大意义如此明显而清楚，这一事业已变成真正全民的事业了。当今年发出“我们要派遣青年爱国者的新队伍去开垦荒地！”的号召时，要求去开荒的人比需要派去的人数多得多。
    那里，在哈萨克斯坦和阿尔泰的草原上，在西部西伯利亚的平原上，共青团派来的新队伍同荒地上的第一批尖兵相会了。这些“老住户”——他们自豪地这样称呼自己——指给同志们看，他们在这不过十到十一个月的期间已经做了多少工作。
    一九五四年四月，当红普列斯尼的一队共青团员下了汽车踏上这儿的泥泞的、潮湿的土地时，散布在荒凉的草原上的稀疏的白桦林中间，只有风在吹着。最近的居民区在一百公里以外。而现在，这个地方已经是两套住宅的新屋所组成的长街，名叫共青团街。发动机在修理厂中响着。在宾佐科洛卡附近停着一列汽车。俱乐部旁边的广告牌上有电影预告。饭厅附近的通告说：入国营农场学校的儿童开始登记了。
    沿着通往“自己的”国营农场的道路，一批新的红普列斯尼人来到了同志们这里。他们看到一年来这里所做出、所取得的成绩后，郑重地宣布：不仅要赶上，而且要赶过！
    在红普列斯尼国营农场中，瓦西里·斯克里普卡的拖拉机工作队是很有名的。它牢牢地握住了流动红旗。而在工作队里占第一位的是拖拉机手瓦西里·加里宁。国营农场里，没有一个人比他耕的多，播的多。一年以前，瓦西里·加里宁在莫斯科一个制鞋工厂做调整自动机床的工作。他的妻子华列金娜也在一个这样的机床上工作。现在，从前的工人成了真正的拖拉机手，他的妻子成了优秀的连挂机手。他们已经成立了自己的家业——种了菜园，还养了一口猪。他们在新地上定居下来了。
    根据全苏共青团中央的决议，颁给瓦西里·加里宁“开垦荒地”奖章。加里宁不久就要去莫斯科了，因为他已被批准参加一九五五年的全苏农业展览会。
    红普列斯尼的共青团员瓦西里·萨瓦利申来到荒地，比加里宁和斯克里普卡晚一年。但是，他看到了他们的成就，学习了他们的经验后，勇敢地向新地的光荣征服者们提出了竞赛。
    瓦西里·萨瓦利申同其他一九五五年到荒地来的红普列斯尼人一道在“铁路”国营农场工作。他领导着一个青年拖拉机工作队。前几天，红普列斯尼区共青团区委会收到了一封带有好消息的信：“新人”赶上了“老人”。按翻耕的公顷数目看，瓦西里·萨瓦利申的拖拉机手们已经同瓦西里·斯克里普卡的拖拉机手们看齐了。
    ……草原上的居民们说，他们已经认不出这从小就熟悉的地方了。平坦笔直的公路横穿过草原，公路通往热闹的国营农场村镇。夜里，草原上布满了灯火——像是天空的星撒布在大地上一样。这是数千个拖拉机手在工作。河上架设了桥。路基高起来了，上面正在铺轨。等秋天来到的时候，丰收的运输队——在新地上靠青年们的勤劳的手生产出来的谷物的运输队，将沿着新公路、新铁路奔向西方。　（本报特约稿）
