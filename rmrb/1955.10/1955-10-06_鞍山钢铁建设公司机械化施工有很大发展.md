Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company Achieves Great Development in Mechanized Construction

　　Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company's mechanized construction has greatly developed over the past four years. In 1952, the company had only 551 pieces of construction machinery and equipment, but in 1955, this number had increased to more than 5,600. In addition to excavators, bulldozers, and dump trucks, the equipment widely used in construction in the past two years also includes heavy-duty cranes with a lifting capacity of up to 100 tons, as well as graders, scarifiers, sheep foot rollers, and more than 20 types of self-made small machines. At present, concrete mixing work has been fully mechanized, the level of mechanization of on-site hoisting has reached 84 percent, and the level of mechanization of horizontal transportation has reached 58 percent. The level of mechanization of earthwork, the most labor-intensive work in construction, reached only 13 percent in 1952, but reached 33 percent in 1954. The management level of mechanized construction at Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company has also improved. This year, the operation of earthmoving machinery has fully adopted the contracting system. The Anshan Iron and Steel Mechanized Supply Station has trained a large number of heavy machinery operators in the past four years. The utilization rate of major construction machinery was 26 percent in 1952, and reached about 54 percent in the first half of 1955. An excavator with a bucket capacity of 0.5 cubic meters could only excavate 45 cubic meters of earth per day in 1952, but this has been increased to 700 cubic meters this year. (Feng Shiming)

    鞍山钢铁建设公司机械化施工有很大发展
    鞍山钢铁建设公司的机械化施工四年来有很大发展。一九五二年这个公司仅有施工机械设备五百五十一台，一九五五年已经增加到五千六百多台。最近二年在施工中广泛采用的设备，除挖土机、推土机、自卸汽车外，还有起重量达一百吨的重型起重机，有平土机、松土机、羊足压道机，以及二十多种自制的小型机具。现在，混凝土搅拌工作已经全部机械化，工地起重的机械化水平已达百分之八十四，水平运输机械化水平达百分之五十八；建筑中最费力的劳动——土方工程的机械化水平，一九五二年只达百分之十三，一九五四年已达百分之三十三。鞍山钢铁建设公司施工机械化管理水平也提高了。今年土方机械经营全部采用了承包制。鞍钢机械化供应站四年中培养了大批重型机械驾驶员。主要建筑机械的利用率，一九五二年是百分之二十六，一九五五年上半年达到百分之五十四左右。一个斗容量半立方公尺的挖土机，一九五二年一天只能挖土四十五立方公尺，今年已经提高到七百立方公尺。（冯世明）
