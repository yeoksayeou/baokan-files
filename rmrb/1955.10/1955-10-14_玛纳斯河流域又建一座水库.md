    Another Reservoir Built in the Manas River Basin
    After completing the Daquangou Reservoir project in the Manas River Basin, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps commenced construction on another reservoir—the Liugou Reservoir—on September 22nd. This reservoir is the largest in the Manas River Basin water conservancy plan. Upon completion, it will have a storage capacity of 70 million cubic meters, irrigating over 400,000 mu of already reclaimed and soon-to-be-reclaimed farmland in the lower reaches of the Manas River Basin, Xinjiang, an area rich in cotton and grain. The plan for this year and next year is to complete 70 percent of the reservoir project, storing 40 million cubic meters of water, and to strive to release water for irrigation of 250,000 mu of land by August of next year. The entire project is scheduled for completion in 1957. The Liugou Reservoir is being constructed using semi-mechanized methods. A large number of earth excavators, sheep's foot rollers, tractors, dump trucks, and other machines have been concentrated on the reservoir construction site, working intensely to complete the dam foundation backfilling project before the ground freezes.

    玛纳斯河流域又建一座水库
    新疆农业生产建设部队，在完成玛纳斯河流域大泉沟水库工程后，九月二十二日又动工修建另一座水库——柳沟水库。这个水库是玛纳斯河流域水利规划中最大的水库，修成后可蓄水七千万公方，灌溉新疆盛产棉粮的玛纳斯河流域下游已经开垦的和即将开垦的四十万亩以上的农田。今明两年计划完成水库工程百分之七十，蓄水四千万公方，争取明年八月放水，灌溉二十五万亩地。全部工程到一九五七年完成。柳沟水库采取半机械化施工，现在水库工地上集中了大批的掘土机、羊角碾、拖拉机、斗车等各种机器，进行紧张的工作，争取在封冻前完成霸基回填工程。
