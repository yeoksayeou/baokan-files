Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: News from the United States indicates that the preliminary results of the Indonesian general election have caused disappointment on the American side.

    The "New York Herald Tribune" stated in an editorial published on the 6th: "Regardless of the final results of the Indonesian general election, this election will not bring any satisfaction to Western observers. In more than half of the votes, it is already painfully clear that the pro-Western Masyumi (Islamic) Party is lagging behind."
    The "Washington Post" said on the same day that the preliminary results of this Indonesian general election are "far from encouraging" because the Indonesian Nationalist Party is "in the lead." The newspaper also expressed concern about the strength shown by the Indonesian Communist Party in the general election.
    Reuters correspondent in Washington, Mark, reported on the 5th that Western countries "expressed outright disappointment with the trend of the results of the Indonesian general election." The news said that although the U.S. State Department is not yet willing to officially comment, "U.S. authorities have expressed private concern."

Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: TASS, The Hague, 6th Dispatch: According to the All-Netherlands Press Agency, due to the impact of the news of the Indonesian parliamentary election results, the stock prices of major companies on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange plunged on October 4th. In one day and night, the stock price of Royal Dutch Shell fell by 17.5 points. The stock prices of the two major Dutch companies, "Unilever" and "AKU," fell by 16 points. Indonesian stock prices fell even more sharply.

    The All-Netherlands Press Agency reported that the achievements of the Indonesian Nationalist Party in the general election "surprised political figures here" because they originally believed that the Masyumi Party would continue to govern.

    美国对印度尼西亚普选初步结果失望
    荷兰大公司的股票价格猛跌
    新华社七日讯　从美国来的消息说明，印度尼西亚普选的初步结果已经引起美国方面的失望。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”在六日发表的一篇社论中说：“不管印度尼西亚普选的最后结果如何，这次选举不会使西方观察家们感到丝毫的满意。在半数以上的选票中，已经令人痛心地明显看出，亲西方的马斯友美（回教）党是落后了”。
    同一天的“华盛顿邮报”说，印度尼西亚这次普选的初步结果“远不是令人鼓舞的”，因为印度尼西亚国民党“一马当先”。这家报纸也对印度尼西亚共产党在普选里所表现出来的力量表示不安。
    路透社驻华盛顿记者马克五日报道，西方国家“对印度尼西亚普选的结果的趋势表示直率的失望”。消息说，美国国务院虽然还不愿正式发表意见，但是“美国当局却表示了私下的关切”。
    新华社七日讯　塔斯社海牙六日讯：据全荷通讯社报道，由于印度尼西亚国会选举结果消息的影响，阿姆斯特丹证券交易所中大公司的股票价格在十月四日猛跌。在一昼夜中，荷兰皇家壳牌公司的股票价格下跌了十七·五个点。荷兰“尤尼列弗”和“阿库”两家大公司的股票价格下跌了十六点。印度尼西亚的股票价格下跌得更厉害。
    全荷通讯社报道，印度尼西亚国民党在普选中取得的成就“出乎这里政治人物的意料”，因为他们原先认为，马斯友美党将继续执政。
