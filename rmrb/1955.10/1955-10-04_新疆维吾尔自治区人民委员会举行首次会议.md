Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, October 3rd: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Committee held its first meeting on the evening of the 2nd. The meeting discussed how to thoroughly convey the spirit and achievements of the Second Session of the First People's Congress of Xinjiang Province, and how to implement the future work tasks of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

The committee members unanimously agreed that in this communication, emphasis should be placed on the important significance of the establishment of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the great achievements made in Xinjiang in the past six years, and the future tasks of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; and to mobilize the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to strive to complete the future tasks of the autonomous region. The meeting pointed out that the instructions made by Dong Biwu, representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, at the Second Session of the First People's Congress of Xinjiang Province, are of great significance to the future work of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and therefore should be communicated in a particularly thorough manner. The meeting determined that in key industrial areas and factories and mines, communication reports must be made. In addition to convening a people's congress for communication, each county must also communicate and explain to cadres and people of all ethnic groups separately.

In discussing future work tasks, the meeting believed that this communication should be closely integrated with mobilizing the people of all ethnic groups to complete these tasks. At present, we must strive to do a good job in all aspects, ensure the completion of the 1955 annual plan, and seize the work of agricultural cooperativization to ensure the completion of the task of establishing 10,000 agricultural production cooperatives by 1957. All departments should strive to over fulfill their tasks in the fourth quarter.

The meeting also studied other related matters.

Those attending the meeting as observers included: the President of the Autonomous Region's Higher People's Court, the Chief Procurator of the Procuratorate, the heads of various departments and bureaus, the heads of various autonomous prefectures, the commissioners of special commissioner's offices, the mayor of Urumqi, and the vice chairmen of the First Committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
