    Welcome the Soviet Artists Delegation
    Sun Wei Shi, Vice President of the China Youth Art Theater
    We are immensely excited about the arrival of the Soviet Artists Delegation led by S.F. Nikishkin! Our people have another opportunity to see the outstanding performances of Soviet artists; our art workers have another opportunity to learn from Soviet artists.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Soviet artists have been invited to our country several times, touring and performing in various parts of China. Their dances and songs are still deeply imprinted in the hearts of the Chinese people. Their assistance to our art workers in terms of artistic theory and experience has played a significant role in improving our artistic standards. The performances and talks of Ulanova, Naserova, Mikhailov, Balinova, Dukinskaya, Smolinskaya, Struzhkova, Hanon, and other artists have left an indelible impression on the Chinese art community and the general audience.
    Now, as our people celebrate the sixth National Day, outstanding artistic envoys from the Soviet Union have come to our country again. Among them is Davydova, an actress from the Moscow Grand Theatre—People's Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and also People's Artist of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. She played the beautiful Spring Maiden in Tchaikovsky's opera "The Snow Maiden," and her singing makes people feel the breath of spring. She played the bold, beautiful, and passionate Carmen in Bizet's opera "Carmen," singing passionate songs in mezzo-soprano, making you feel endless charm. She is an actress deeply loved and respected by Soviet audiences.
    In the Soviet Artists Delegation, there are also the Fedorova Five Sisters, who sing folk songs. These five sisters have loved singing since they were young, and their parents also had a talent for singing, often singing folk songs to them. They love music and love to sing. After the Soviet-German War, they all went to work at the Kirov factory, participating in the workers' chorus in their spare time. They were cultivated and improved in the workers' chorus. They love the songs they sing, understand the songs they sing, and can use their whole hearts to express the content of those songs. In 1948, they became professional actors. Workers from all over the Soviet Union often write songs for them, sending the songs they wrote to the Fedorova Sisters, so that they can sing them to the vast number of Soviet people who love art.
    In the Soviet Artists Delegation, there is also the pianist Merzhanov, who won an international competition award; there is also the Soviet People's Artist, Amiranashvili, a soloist from the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre; there is also the violinist Sobolevsky, who won an international competition award; and there are also experts in acrobatics and soft gymnastics. Undoubtedly, this performance by Soviet artists in China will once again be warmly welcomed by the vast number of Chinese people who love art. They will once again give our art workers a valuable opportunity to learn.

    欢迎苏联艺术家代表团
    中国青年艺术剧院副院长　孙维世
    由斯·弗·尼基什金领导的苏联艺术家代表团到我国来了，我们感到无限兴奋！我国人民又有机会看到卓越的苏联艺术家们的演出；我国艺术工作者又有机会向苏联艺术家们学习。
    从一九四九年中华人民共和国成立以来，苏联艺术家们好几次应邀来到了我国，在我国各地进行了巡回演出，他们的舞姿和歌声，至今还深深地印在中国人民的心里；他们在艺术理论和艺术经验方面给予我国艺术工作者的帮助，对于我们的艺术水平的提高，起了显著的作用。乌兰诺娃、纳赛罗娃、米哈伊洛夫、巴莉诺娃、杜金斯卡娅、斯莫林斯卡娅、斯特鲁兹柯娃、哈侬和其他艺术家们的演出和谈话，在我国艺术界和广大观众中留下了不可磨灭的印象。
    现在，当我国人民迎接第六个国庆节的时候，苏联的优秀艺术使者又到我国来了。这里面有莫斯科大剧院的女演员达维多娃——她是俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义联邦共和国人民演员，也是格鲁吉亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的人民演员；她曾在柴可夫斯基的歌剧“雪公主”中饰演美丽的春神，她的歌声，使人呼吸到春的气息；她在比才的歌剧“卡门”中饰演大胆、美丽、热情的姑娘卡门，用中音唱着热情的歌儿，使你感到无限的魅力。她是一位极受苏联观众热爱和尊敬的演员。
    在苏联艺术家代表团中，还有唱民歌的费奥多罗娃五姊妹。这姊妹五人从小就喜欢唱歌，她们的父母也都有唱歌的天才，常常唱民歌给她们听。她们热爱音乐、热爱歌唱。苏德战争后，她们都到基洛夫工厂去工作，在业余的时间参加工人合唱团，她们就在工人的合唱队中得到了培养和提高。她们热爱她们所唱的歌，理解她们所唱的歌，能用她们的全部心灵去表达那些歌曲的内容。一九四八年她们成了专业的演员。苏联各地的工人们常常为她们写歌，把所写的歌寄给费奥多罗娃姊妹，让她们唱给广大的爱好艺术的苏联人民听。
    在苏联艺术家代表团中，还有荣获国际比赛奖的钢琴家麦尔热诺夫；还有苏联人民演员、梯比里斯歌舞院的独唱家阿米拉纳什维利；还有荣获国际竞赛奖的提琴家索波列夫斯基；还有杂技和柔软体操专家。无疑地，这次苏联艺术家们在中国的演出，又将受到广大的爱好艺术的中国人民的热烈欢迎。他们又将给予我国的艺术工作者们一次宝贵的学习机会。
