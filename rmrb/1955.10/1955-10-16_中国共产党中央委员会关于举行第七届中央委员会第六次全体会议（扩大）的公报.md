    The Sixth Plenary Session (Expanded) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held from October 4th to 11th. Thirty-eight members and twenty-five alternate members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China attended the meeting. Three hundred and eighty-eight people attended the meeting as observers, including the Secretary of the Shanghai Bureau, the Secretaries of the Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai Municipal Party Committees, the Secretaries of the Provincial Party Committees, the Autonomous Region Party Committees, and the Regional Party Committees, as well as the responsible comrades of the various ministries and commissions of the Party Central Committee and the Party groups of the various departments of the central state organs.
    The agenda of the Sixth Plenary Session (Expanded) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China included two items: First, to discuss and adopt the Resolution on Agricultural Cooperation; Second, to discuss and adopt the Resolution on Convening the Eighth National Congress of the Party.
    On the first day of the meeting, after Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, announced the opening of the meeting, Chen Boda, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, made an "Explanation of the Draft Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" on behalf of the Central Political Bureau, and Deng Xiaoping, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, made an "Explanation of the Draft Resolution on Convening the Eighth National Congress of the Party" on behalf of the Central Political Bureau.
    The meeting then proceeded with heated discussions. Eighty people spoke at the plenary session (due to time constraints, another one hundred and sixty-seven people were unable to speak at the meeting, and their speeches were only distributed by the meeting). They unanimously agreed with "The Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation (Draft)" and "The Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Convening the Eighth National Congress of the Party (Draft)", as well as the two explanations made by Comrades Chen Boda and Deng Xiaoping. Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Peng Dehuai, Peng Zhen, Deng Xiaoping, and other members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China also made important speeches at the meeting.
    The meeting focused on the issue of actively developing agricultural producers' cooperatives throughout the country and gradually realizing agricultural cooperation. The entire discussion was filled with confidence in the cause of agricultural cooperation and a spirit of criticism and self-criticism of shortcomings in the work. On July 31st of this year, at the meeting of the secretaries of provincial, municipal, and district party committees convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Mao Zedong made a report on "The Question of Agricultural Cooperation", pointing out that a new high tide of the socialist mass movement was about to arrive in the rural areas of the country; he criticized the right-leaning errors of being dizzy with success in the face of the high tide of cooperation; and he elucidated the historical development law of agricultural cooperation in our country and the principles and policies that the Party should adopt in leading the agricultural cooperation movement. This historically significant instruction of Comrade Mao Zedong was widely disseminated to the rural areas throughout the country and became a tremendous source of encouragement and a correct guiding principle for the agricultural cooperation movement. The inspection and discussion of the question of agricultural cooperation by party organizations at all levels in the past two months, as well as the new development of agricultural producers' cooperatives in the past two months, have further proved the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions. At this meeting, many speakers cited rich and practical investigation materials and concrete and vivid examples to illustrate the necessity of actively developing the agricultural cooperation movement at present and the fact that our Party is fully capable of leading this large-scale new socialist mass movement. Many local party committee secretaries reported in their speeches the preliminary plans for agricultural cooperation in their respective regions, which they had formulated based on Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, and the vigorous new atmosphere of the rapid development of cooperatives in various places in the past two months after the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong were conveyed. The speakers also conducted concrete discussions on how industry, transportation, handicrafts, finance, banking, trade, culture, education, science, health, military affairs, politics, and law, how the political work and organizational work of party organizations, and how the work of mass organizations such as the Communist Youth League, trade unions, and women's federations should meet and cooperate with the new high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement.
    On the last day of the meeting, Comrade Mao Zedong made a summary of the meeting's discussions. Subsequently, the meeting unanimously adopted the "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation", the "Resolution on Convening the Eighth National Congress of the Party", and the "Regulations on the Number of Delegates and Election Methods for the Eighth National Congress of the Party". The meeting basically adopted the draft of the "Model Charter of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives", which had been revised many times during the trial implementation, and decided to submit it to the State Council of the People's Republic

    中国共产党中央委员会关于举行第七届中央委员会第六次全体会议（扩大）的公报
    中国共产党第七届中央委员会在十月四日至十一日举行了第六次全体会议（扩大）。出席这次会议的有中国共产党中央委员会委员三十八人和候补委员二十五人。上海局书记，北京市委、天津市委和上海市委书记，各省委、各自治区党委和各地委的书记，以及党中央各部委和中央国家机关各部门党组的负责同志等三百八十八人列席了这次会议。
    中国共产党第七届中央委员会第六次全体会议（扩大）的议程有两项：第一，讨论和通过关于农业合作化的决议；第二，讨论和通过关于召开党的第八次全国代表大会的决议。
    会议的第一日，在中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东宣布开会以后，由中国共产党中央委员会委员陈伯达代表中央政治局作了“关于农业合作化问题的决议草案的说明”，由中国共产党中央委员会政治局委员邓小平代表中央政治局作了“关于召开党的第八次全国代表大会的决议草案的说明”。
    会议接着进行了热烈的讨论。在全体会议上发言的有八十人（因时间关系，还有一百六十七人未能在会上发言，只由会议印发了他们的发言稿），他们一致同意“中国共产党第七届中央委员会第六次全体会议关于农业合作化问题的决议草案”和“中国共产党第七届中央委员会第六次全体会议关于召开党的第八次全国代表大会的决议草案”以及陈伯达同志和邓小平同志所作的两个说明。中国共产党中央委员会政治局委员刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、陈云、彭德怀、彭真、邓小平等同志都在会上作了重要发言。
    会议着重讨论了在全国范围内积极地发展农业生产合作社，逐步地实现农业合作化问题。整个讨论充满了对于农业合作化事业的信心以及对工作中的缺点的批评和自我批评的精神。今年七月三十一日，在中共中央委员会召集的省委、市委和区党委书记会议上，毛泽东同志作了“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，指出在全国农村中新的社会主义群众运动的高潮就要到来；批判了在合作化高潮面前被胜利吓昏了头脑的右倾错误；阐明了我国农业合作化的历史发展规律和党领导农业合作化运动应当采取的方针政策。毛泽东同志这一具有历史意义的指示，被普遍地传达到了全国农村，成为农业合作化运动的巨大的鼓舞力量和正确的指导方针。两个月以来各级党组织对于农业合作化问题的检查和讨论，以及两个月以来农业生产合作社的新发展，进一步证明了毛泽东同志的指示的正确性。在这次会议上，许多发言者引用了丰富切实的调查材料和具体生动的事例，阐明了农业合作化运动在目前必须积极发展以及我们党完全能够领导这一规模宏大的新的社会主义的群众运动的道理。不少的地方党委书记在发言中，报告了他们根据毛泽东同志的指示所拟定的本地区农业合作化的初步规划，报告了近两月来在传达毛泽东同志的指示以后各地合作社迅速发展的蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。发言者还从工业、交通运输业、手工业、财政、金融、贸易、文化、教育、科学、卫生、军事、政治、法律等方面，从党组织的政治工作和组织工作等方面，以及从青年团、工会、妇女联合会等群众团体的工作方面，应该如何来迎接和配合农业合作化运动的新高潮，进行了具体的讨论。
    在会议的最后一天，毛泽东同志作了会议讨论的总结。随后，会议一致通过了“关于农业合作化问题的决议”，“关于召开党的第八次全国代表大会的决议”，“关于党的第八次全国代表大会代表名额和选举办法的规定”。会议基本上通过了在试行中经过多次修改的“农业生产合作社示范章程”的草案，决定提交中华人民共和国国务院和全国人民代表大会常务委员会讨论。
