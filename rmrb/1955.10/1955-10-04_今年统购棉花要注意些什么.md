This year, new cotton has been put on the market successively. Supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the country, entrusted by the state, have begun this year's new cotton procurement work. This year, most cotton-producing areas across the country are showing signs of a bumper harvest, and the total cotton output may exceed the original plan. It is estimated that the task of purchasing 20.06 million dan of ginned cotton this year can be completed or overfulfilled.

This year, the supply and marketing cooperatives' unified purchase of cotton for the state will be combined with the work of recovering pre-purchased cotton. This is a characteristic of this year's unified cotton purchase and a favorable condition for completing the task. In order to have sufficient cotton to meet the needs of the textile industry, the state launched a large-scale pre-purchase campaign this spring. The state issued more than 140 million yuan more in deposits to farmers who signed pre-purchase cotton contracts than last year, and at the same time, preferentially supplied cotton farmers with a large number of production and living materials. These measures were warmly welcomed by the majority of cotton farmers. The state's adoption of this correct method has resulted in the inclusion of the vast majority of the planned unified purchase of commodity cotton into pre-purchase contracts this year. As long as all the pre-purchased cotton is recovered, the unified purchase task can be basically completed. Last year, the supply and marketing cooperatives acted as agents for the unified purchase of cotton, implementing the method of universal assessment of production and sales for cotton farmers, which was very laborious and ineffective. As a result, some cotton farmers even developed some misunderstandings about the state's unified purchase policy. Under the circumstances where the small-scale peasant economy dominates, adopting this year's method of combining unified purchase with fulfilling pre-purchase contracts will make the work proceed more smoothly. Therefore, this year, all areas that have carried out cotton pre-purchases should determine the cotton sales tasks of cotton farmers according to the quantity stipulated in the pre-purchase contract. For cotton farmers in non-pre-purchase areas, and cotton farmers who cannot deliver cotton according to the pre-purchase quantity due to the influence of natural conditions, their delivery tasks can be appropriately determined according to the production of agricultural production cooperatives and better mutual aid groups. In individual areas where the recovery of pre-purchased cotton is poor, the method of key assessment of production and sales can be implemented for individual farmers who hoard and are reluctant to sell.

Some staff members who are responsible for the unified purchase of cotton have not correctly understood the relationship between the unified purchase of cotton and the recovery of pre-purchased cotton, and mistakenly believe that "clearing pre-purchase contracts will affect the unified purchase," or that "since the unified purchase is implemented, there is no need to clear pre-purchase contracts." They have adopted a negative attitude towards recovering pre-purchased cotton. This will greatly facilitate some cotton farmers to conceal production and refuse to fulfill their contracts, increase the amount of all work, and create artificial difficulties for this year's cotton unified purchase work, which must be corrected immediately.

In order to complete and overfulfill this year's cotton unified purchase task, in addition to making efforts to recover pre-purchased cotton, what else should we pay attention to?

We should once again conduct in-depth patriotic education for the majority of cotton farmers, and repeatedly explain to them the significance of the state's unified purchase of cotton. Last year, various places also carried out extensive propaganda and education work for the unified purchase of cotton, which played a considerable role. However, the propaganda work in many areas was not deep and thorough, and had great one-sidedness: either overemphasizing the propaganda of the immediate interests of cotton farmers, while ignoring the necessity of obeying national plans and the long-term prospect of building socialism; or only talking about the benefits of unified purchase of cotton to the country, without linking it to the vital interests of cotton farmers. We should use the specific facts of the local area to publicize to farmers the significance of selling cotton to the state in supporting the country's industrial construction, especially the construction of the textile industry, as well as the role of accumulating funds and improving people's lives, and call on farmers to consciously and voluntarily sell cotton. We should not only publicize the necessity of patriotic cotton sales from a political perspective, but also publicize the state's material incentive policy for farmers' cotton sales from an economic perspective, that is, for every 100 jin of ginned cotton sold by cotton farmers beyond the pre-sale task, the state will issue supply vouchers for 10 jin of grain and 10 chi of cotton cloth in addition to the fixed supply standard. This is something that others cannot enjoy. For the convenience of life, farmers should also actively sell cotton.

Reasonably verify the cotton grade and implement the "superior grade, superior price" policy. Last year, many supply and marketing cooperatives did not pay enough attention to and work hard to overcome the technical difficulties of inspecting cotton grades, and adopted the wrong practice of "rather low than high," suppressing grades and prices, causing some losses to some cotton farmers and causing some cotton farmers to be unwilling to sell cotton to the state or choose stations to sell. Many facts have proved that: whichever supply and marketing cooperative suppresses grades and prices in cotton purchasing, the cotton purchasing volume in that area will decrease accordingly, and the production enthusiasm of local cotton farmers will also be affected. Moreover, obtaining illegal profits from low grading and price suppression is a capitalist business method, and we must resolutely oppose this method and prevent and correct the practice of price suppression. Of course, the practice of raising grades and prices is also wrong and should also be prevented.

The quality of material supply in cotton producing areas directly affects the cotton purchasing work. If cotton farmers cannot buy the necessary means of production and living materials in time, they will not be willing to sell cotton immediately. Last year, some cotton areas did not do a good job in material supply. The money in the hands of cotton farmers could not be spent, so they were unwilling to sell cotton. This situation is enough to show the close relationship between material supply and purchasing work. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places should pay special attention to the characteristic that the purchasing power of farmers in cotton producing areas is growing faster than that of farmers in general areas, study the needs of cotton farmers, open up sources of a variety of new products, and do their best to meet the requirements of cotton farmers to develop production and improve their lives, and promote cotton farmers to actively sell cotton to the state.

During the unified purchase of cotton, special attention should be paid to market management. Some cadres intentionally or unintentionally abandoned market management after the implementation of the unified purchase, resulting in serious consequences. During the peak cotton harvesting season last year, a businessman in the Sixth District of Yaoxian, Shaanxi, purchased more than 300 jin of cotton from cotton farmers overnight; around October last year, the supply and marketing cooperative in the Second District of Qianxian, Shaanxi, purchased more than 30,000 jin of ginned cotton, of which more than 10,000 jin were purchased by illegal merchants from cotton farmers and were blocked by the supply and marketing cooperative. These facts prove that strengthening market management, constantly fighting against speculative merchants and illegal rich peasants, and even implementing necessary legal sanctions against them, is necessary for the smooth completion of the cotton unified purchase task. The investigation and research work on private cotton merchants, rural soil spinning and weaving households, and private cotton processing industry must also be strengthened, to find out the details of these industries, properly manage and arrange them; a wide range of patriotic and law-abiding education should also be carried out for the employees in these industries, so that they can honestly operate their businesses.

During the cotton unified purchase work in various places, we should also pay double attention to the storage and security work of cotton, and be vigilant against possible sabotage activities by counter-revolutionaries.

Unified purchase of cotton is a major event for the supply and marketing cooperative system. Hundreds of thousands of employees in the supply and marketing cooperative system should launch an increase production and practice economy campaign in the cotton purchasing work, accelerate the turnover of funds, save circulation costs, and reduce cotton losses and processing costs. At the same time, they should learn from last year's lessons, rationally allocate and use processing forces, and strive for "fast collection, fast ginning, and fast transportation" to support the production of the national textile industry and meet the national military and civilian requirements for cotton supply.

### 今年统购棉花要注意些什么

    今年统购棉花要注意些什么
    新棉已经陆续上市。全国各地的供销合作社接受国家的委托，开始了本年度的新棉收购工作。今年全国多数产棉区呈现丰收景象，棉花总产量可能超过原定计划。本年度收购两千零六十万担皮棉的任务，估计可以完成或超额完成。
    今年供销社为国家统购棉花，将同收回预购棉花的工作结合进行。这是今年统购棉花的特点，也是完成任务的有利条件。国家为了掌握足够的棉花，供应纺织工业的需要，在今年春季展开了大规模的预购工作。国家给签订预购棉花合同的农民发出的定金比去年增加了一亿四千多万元，同时对棉农优待供应了大批生产、生活资料。这些措施受到广大棉农的热烈欢迎。国家采取了这种正确的办法，使今年计划统购的商品棉花的绝大部分都已列入预购合同。只要把预购棉花全部收回，统购任务就可基本完成。去年供销社代统购棉花，实行对棉农普遍评产评售的办法，费力很大，收效很小，某些棉农因此还对国家的统购政策发生一些错觉。在小农经济占优势的情况下，采取今年这种统购和履行预购合同相结合的办法，将使工作的进行更加顺利。因此，今年凡是进行了棉花预购的地区，都应该按照预购合同规定的数量，确定棉农的售棉任务。对于非预购地区的棉农，和因自然条件影响不能按预购数量交售棉花的棉农，则可按照农业生产合作社和较好的互助组的生产情况，适当地确定他们的交售任务。在预购棉花收回较差的个别地区，对囤积惜售的个别农户，可以重点实行评产评售的办法。
    有些担任统购棉花任务的工作人员，没有正确认识统购棉花同收回预购棉花的关系，错误地认为“清理预购合同会影响统购”，或者以为“既然实行统购就不需要清理预购合同”，他们对收回预购棉花采取了消极的态度。这将给某些棉农隐瞒产量、拒绝履行合同的行为大开方便之门，增加全部工作的份量，使今年的棉花统购工作产生人为的困难，必须立即加以纠正。
    为了完成和超额完成本年度的棉花统购任务，除了必须努力收回预购棉花以外，还要注意些什么呢？
    我们应该对广大棉农再一次进行深入的爱国主义教育，反复向他们讲解国家统购棉花的意义。去年各地统购棉花，也曾进行广泛的宣传教育工作，发挥过相当的作用。但许多地区的宣传工作做得不深不透，并带有很大的片面性：或者过分强调宣传棉农的眼前利益，而忽视了服从国家计划的必要性和建设社会主义的远大前途；或者只讲统购棉花对国家的好处，而没有同棉农的切身利益联系起来。我们应该通过当地的具体事实，向农民宣传把棉花卖给国家，对支援国家工业建设、特别是纺织工业建设的意义，以及对国家积累资金和改善人民生活的作用，号召农民自觉自愿地出售棉花。我们不仅要从政治方面宣传爱国售棉的必要性，同时要从经济方面宣传国家对于农民售棉的物质鼓励政策，即棉农在预售任务以外，每多售一百斤皮棉，国家即在定量供应标准之外发给十斤粮食和十尺棉布的供应凭证。这是其他人享受不到的。农民为了生活的方便，也该积极出售棉花。
    合理地验定棉花级别，贯彻“优级优价”政策。去年有不少供销合作社没有足够重视和努力克服检验棉花等级的技术困难，采取了错误的“宁低勿高”的做法，压级压价，使部分棉农受了一些损失，造成部分棉农不愿把棉花卖给国家或选站投售的不正常情况。很多事实证明：哪个供销社在收棉中压级压价，哪个地区的收棉量就随之下降，当地的棉农的生产情绪也会受到影响。而且，从验级偏低、压级压价中获取非法利润，乃是资本主义的经营方法，我们必须坚决反对这种方法，防止和纠正压级压价的做法。当然，提级抬价的做法也是错误的，同样应该加以防止。
    棉产区物资供应工作的好坏，直接影响棉花收购工作。棉农如果不能及时买到必需的生产资料和生活资料，是不会愿意马上出售棉花的。去年有些棉区没有做好物资供应工作，棉农手里的钱花不出去，就不愿出卖棉花。这种情况足以说明物资供应和收购工作的密切关系。各地供销社应该特别注意棉产区农民比一般地区农民的购买力增长更快的特点，研究棉农的需要，开辟多种多样新产品的货源，尽力满足棉农发展生产提高生活的要求，推动棉农积极把棉花卖给国家。
    在统购棉花期间，要特别注意市场管理。有些干部在实行统购以后，有意无意地放弃了市场管理，造成严重的恶果。在去年收棉旺季当中，陕西耀县六区一个商人在一夜之间向棉农套购了三百多斤棉花；陕西乾县二区供销社在去年十月前后收购了三万多斤皮棉，其中一万多斤是不法商人从棉农手中套购了去而被供销社挡下来的。这些事实证明，加强市场管理，不断地同投机商人、不法富农作斗争，以至对他们实行必要的法律制裁，乃是顺利完成棉花统购任务所必需的。对私营棉花商贩、农村土纺土织户和私营棉花加工业的调查研究工作也必须加强，摸清这些行业的底细，妥善地加以管理和安排；对这些行业的从业人员也要进行一次广泛的爱国守法教育，要他们老老实实地经营业务。
    各地在棉花统购工作的过程中，还应该加倍注意做好棉花的保管工作和保卫工作，警惕反革命分子可能的破坏活动。
    统购棉花是供销社系统的一件大事。供销社系统的几十万职工，要在收购棉花工作中，展开增产节约运动，加速资金周转，节约流转费用，减少棉花损耗和加工成本。同时要接受去年的教训，合理地调配和运用加工力量，争取“快收、快轧、快运”，支援国家纺织工业的生产，满足全国军民对絮棉供应的要求。
