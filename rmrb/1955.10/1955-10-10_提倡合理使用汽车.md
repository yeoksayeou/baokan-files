    Advocating Rational Use of Automobiles
    To the Editor:
    Currently, the total number of cars and buses owned by various government agencies and organizations is considerable. If attention is paid to conservation in their use, the consumption of gasoline and the wear and tear on parts can be greatly reduced. Based on the current usage of automobiles, I would like to make the following suggestions.
    If it is possible for two or more responsible personnel in various government agencies and organizations to share a car that is allocated for their exclusive use, they should try to share as much as possible, without necessarily requiring one car per person; if the accommodation is close to the office, they should try not to take a car back and forth; it is still common for people to use cars to visit parks, restaurants, theaters, and dances, which should be avoided as much as possible; it also happens that personal cars are used by family members to pick up and drop off children at nurseries, schools, or even to go shopping, and these unreasonable phenomena should be changed immediately.
    The use of public cars should be strictly regulated and a dispatch system should be implemented, and they should not be dispatched for private matters in general; the practice of some units frequently using cars to send telegrams, documents, or theater and dance tickets should be corrected and replaced with bicycles or motorcycles.
    There is also waste in the use of buses. For example, some units send special buses back and forth several times a day to pick up and drop off female staff members with infants to feed their babies. If nurseries were set up near the office, this would not be necessary. In addition, most units use buses very little, and they are idle for a long time. I suggest that these buses be "centrally used." I suggest that the buses of certain central-level units in the Beijing area be centralized and uniformly allocated by the机关事务管理局 of the State Council, and a leasing system be implemented, so that the utilization rate of buses will be greatly improved, and one car can be used as several cars. I hope that the leading organs will consider this method.
    In addition, improving car maintenance is also a problem worth noting. The cars of some agencies, large and small, do not have carports and are parked in the open air, which makes the paint on the body easy to peel off, the body and parts easy to rust, and the tires easy to deteriorate, which shortens the life of the car. The cost of labor and materials for painting a car is about 400 yuan, but the warranty period is only six months; if the maintenance is poor, the loss is great just in terms of painting costs. Therefore, it is entirely worthwhile to build simple carports to protect cars.

    提倡合理使用汽车编辑同志：
    目前各机关、团体所有的小汽车和大客车，总数是不少的。如果在使用上注意节约，就可以大大减少汽油的消费量和机件的损耗。根据目前汽车的使用情况，我想提出下列建议。
    各机关、团体拨给负责人员的专用小汽车，如果可以两个人或几个人合用一辆的，应该尽量设法合用，不一定非每人一辆不可；住宿地点距离办公处较近的，往返的时候尽可能不坐车；乘坐小汽车去逛公园、上饭馆、看戏、跳舞等的情况现在还很普遍，应该尽量避免；把个人专用小汽车给家属使用，如接送小孩上托儿所、上学校甚至逛大街等，这些不合理现象目前也有，应该立即改变。
    对公用小汽车的使用应该严格地规定并执行派遣制度，凡属私事一般不予派用；某些单位经常用小汽车送电报、文件或戏票、舞票的做法应该纠正，而改用自行车或摩托车递送。
    在大客车的使用上目前也有浪费现象。例如有些单位每天派专车往返几次接送有乳儿的女工作人员喂奶，如果在办公地点的附近设立乳儿室，就不需要这样做了。另外，大部分单位的大客车使用时间很少，闲置不用的时间却很长。我建议把这些大客车“集中使用”，我建议把在北京地区的中央级某些单位的大客车集中，由国务院机关事务管理局统一调配，实行租用制，那末大客车利用率就会大大提高，一辆车可以当作几辆车用。这个办法希望领导机关加以考虑。
    另外，改善汽车保养情况也是一个值得注意的问题。某些机关的大小汽车都没有车房，停放在露天，这样车身的漆皮容易脱落，车身和机件容易生锈、轮胎容易变质，汽车使用寿命就会缩短。一辆小汽车油漆一次的工料费约四百元，保用期限却只有六个月；假如保养不善，只拿油漆费来说损失就很大。因此，建筑简单的车房来保护汽车是完全值得的。　　　奇中
