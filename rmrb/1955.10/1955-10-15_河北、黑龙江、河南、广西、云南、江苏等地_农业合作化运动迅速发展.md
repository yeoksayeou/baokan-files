    Agricultural Cooperative Movement Rapidly Develops
    (Our report) The socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants in Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Guangxi, Yunnan, Jiangsu and other provinces is increasing day by day, and taking the road of cooperativization is becoming or has already become a mass demand. Hundreds of millions of peasants are actively demanding to join agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the agricultural cooperative movement is developing rapidly.
    As of early October, the number of peasant households joining old and new cooperatives in Hebei Province had reached more than 1.37 million, of which more than 80 percent were poor and lower-middle peasants. According to statistics from more than 45,000 old cooperatives, more than 559,000 new members were absorbed. During the same period, more than 49,000 new cooperatives were also built, and a number of new cooperatives can also be completed recently. The province's original plan to develop cooperatives this winter and next spring has now been completed by 76.6 percent.
    While promoting the overall plan for agricultural cooperativization, Heilongjiang Province is consolidating and expanding existing agricultural producers' cooperatives and preparing to establish new cooperatives. Some new cooperatives have been built in some areas. According to surveys: about 60 percent of poor peasants outside the cooperatives in the province and about 50 percent of lower-middle peasants outside the cooperatives have expressed their desire to join the cooperatives. In the Hejiang area, more than 500 mutual aid teams have registered to establish cooperatives. At present, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has made a preliminary overall plan for the province's cooperativization based on the new situation of the province's agricultural cooperative movement. It is expected that before the spring plowing next year, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province will increase from the existing 23,800 to 32,400, and the proportion of peasant households joining the cooperatives will increase from the current 36.8 percent to 60 percent.
    More than 2 million peasant households in Henan Province have registered to participate in agricultural producers' cooperatives. Among them, poor peasants, lower-middle peasants among new middle peasants, and lower-middle peasants among old middle peasants account for the majority. In order to meet the demands of peasants to join the cooperatives, Party organizations at all levels in the province have strengthened their leadership over mutual assistance and cooperation. According to incomplete statistics: more than 100,000 people have been trained or are being trained as key personnel for establishing cooperatives in various places. More than 10,000 new cooperatives are being established or have been completed.
    According to statistics from the Baise District of Guangxi Province in mid-September, more than 21,000 mutual aid teams requested to be converted into cooperatives, and 200,000 peasant households have registered to join the cooperatives, of which 80 percent are poor and lower-middle peasants. After preliminary publicity in Xincheng County, Yishan District, more than 1,600 mutual aid teams, totaling more than 13,000 households, automatically applied to the district and township to convert to cooperatives. In Lingui County, Guilin District, more than 6,000 mutual aid teams are actively creating conditions for conversion to cooperatives. In Quanxian, Luzhai, Xing'an and other counties, tens of thousands of mutual aid teams have requested the local Party branches to convert to cooperatives. Under the new situation of the upsurge of cooperativization, the planned targets for establishing cooperatives in various parts of Guangxi have been exceeded. The province originally planned to develop 55,000 agricultural cooperatives this winter and next spring, but now it has increased to 68,000.
    Yunnan Province has basically completed its plan to build 25,000 new agricultural producers' cooperatives and expand the original 7,100 old cooperatives before this year's autumn harvest. As of mid-September, 15,347 new cooperatives have elected cooperative cadres, formulated cooperative charters and production plans, and are fully engaged in autumn harvesting and sowing and regular consolidation work. At present, the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounts for 21 percent of the total number of peasant households in the province.
    As of October 4, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives in Jiangsu Province has increased from 35,773 in July to 121,494, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounts for 39.88 percent of the total number of peasant households in the province. According to current statistics, most of the newly joined peasants are poor peasants and lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants. In order to adapt to the continuously rising situation of the cooperative movement, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has revised the plan and made an overall plan, planning to continue to establish more than 22,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives this winter and next spring.
