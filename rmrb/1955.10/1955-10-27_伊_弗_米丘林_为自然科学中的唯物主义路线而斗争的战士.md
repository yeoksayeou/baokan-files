    I.V. Michurin - A Fighter for the Materialist Line in Natural Science
    Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences N. Tsitsin

    This year, the scientific community of the Soviet Union, like the scientific communities of many other countries in the world, commemorates the 100th anniversary of the birth of I.V. Michurin. Michurin's name occupies a prominent place in the history of natural science and in modern science. It stands alongside such great names as Darwin, Pasteur, Timiryazev, and Pavlov.

    In natural science, Michurin was an active fighter for the realization of the materialist line, and throughout his life he relentlessly exposed various idealist and metaphysical distortions in science. Michurin's profound theoretical summarization of the vast experimental material he accumulated enabled him to determine many of the most important regularities in the development of plant organisms and to propose to researchers some new methods that help create new types of crops and livestock. In the creation of new types and varieties of fruit trees and berries, Michurin's practical activities, like his theoretical work, have left a deep mark on all departments of biology. Therefore, the phrase "working in the Michurin way" has now become a term in natural science. The starting point of the principle of "working in the Michurin way" is: first, to treat the object of study with a thorough materialist attitude and master the dialectical method of analyzing the process and regularities of natural phenomena. Second, to effectively utilize the objects being studied, not for the sake of research, but to transform them and seek benefits for human society.

    Creating new research methods, creating profound and perfect methods to influence the nature of organisms based on the principle of the inseparable unity and contradiction between organisms and their environment, is the most representative characteristic of Michurin's scientific and practical activities.

    The Michurin era in the development of natural science is closely linked to the new changes in social life and to the socialist era.

    The revolutionary changes realized in our country due to the October Socialist Revolution changed the social role of science. The revolutionary changes in society put forward the task of transforming nature and made new demands on science. It was in response to this demand that Michurin, during the period of his life after the October Revolution, created effective methods for transforming the nature of plants, cultivated the best types of fruit trees, berries, and other plants, and made extremely outstanding theoretical summaries. It was in this way that Michurin began a new era in the development of biological science on a fundamentally new theoretical basis.

    Darwin took a very important first step on the road to revealing the laws of the biological world. He revealed and convincingly proved the general state of development of the biological world, thoroughly refuted the metaphysical and idealist views of the biological world, and armed science with a new historical method of understanding the biological world. But Darwin was unable to take the next step, which was equally important in science, that is, he could not explain the causes of development, just as he could not raise the question of controlling the biological world.

    Michurin's greatness lies in the fact that he closely combined the correct understanding of the regularities of the biological world's development with the constant search for and application of new ways, methods, and means of influencing the biological world. He always adapted theory to practice and tested theory in practice.

    Although Michurin paid close attention to theoretical research, he did not approach materialist dialectics by studying the principles of dialectics from books, but from his own practical activities, from constant contact with nature, understanding its regularities, and exploring methods of influencing nature.

    Everyone knows that Michurin did not embark on the correct path of transforming the nature of organisms from the very beginning, but traveled a long and complex road of searching for new methods, experiencing the joy of success and the pain of failure. As a frank and sincere researcher, Michurin himself pointed out that the incorrect theoretical stance and the resulting practical methods were the cause and result of his erroneous views in the first fifteen years of his activities.

    During this period of activity, he had neither a clear theory nor a clarified method, but only clearly defined tasks. During this period of transition in the search for new methods of influencing the biological world, he studied acclimatization, gradual acclimatization, and inbreeding by sowing seeds and selecting the best seedlings.

    Based on his knowledge and experience, Michurin finally resolutely turned to the method of distant hybridization and combined this method with other selection methods, cultivating hybrid seedlings, asexual hybridization, etc. The method of distant hybridization between different genera and species of plants is the main method in his work. The vast majority of the varieties he cultivated were created using this method. All of I.V. Michurin's practical activities and his theoretical summaries prove the great significance of this method for selection. The following facts prove this point: most of the more than 300 new types of fruit trees and berry plants obtained by Michurin were obtained by using distant hybridization (cross-breeding between different genera and species), or within the same species, but their parent groups, in terms of their origin, were intra-species hybrids of parents belonging to different eco-geographical regions.

    On the basis of distant hybridization, Michurin and his successors solved the most important problem of moving fruit trees and berry plants to the northern regions of the Soviet Union - Siberia and the Urals. Michurin cultivated a huge number of new varieties of pears, cherries, plums, raspberries, blackberries, and grapes. The best varieties of 63 kinds of various fruit trees and berry plants he cultivated are all listed as standard varieties in the Soviet Union, including 22 kinds of apples, 7 kinds of pears, 7 kinds of cherries, 6 kinds of plums, 2 kinds of apricots, 3 kinds of raspberries, 3 kinds of gooseberries, 7 kinds of grapes, and others.

    Acknowledging the importance of distant hybridization in Michurin's work does not mean that Michurin was limited to these methods alone.

    After embarking on the path of distant hybridization, he also incorporated some new methods and measures, never before used, into his system for transforming the nature of organisms.

    The fact that the heredity of young hybrid plants changes under the influence of living conditions is one of the principles of Michurin's selection methods.

    Michurin greatly changed the genetic basis of organisms by means of hybridization. He controlled the dominance of their qualities and characteristics by providing appropriate conditions for the development of hybrid plants.

    Michurin did not think that mating or grafting two organisms was enough to solve the task of obtaining new varieties. Further work on hybrid offspring and their directed cultivation occupy an important position in Michurin's system of distant hybridization.

    If hybridization is the starting stage of Michurin's extensive research on the process of type formation, then hybrid cultivation is the completion stage of the formation of new organisms.

    One of the effective methods Michurin used to cultivate fruit tree seedlings with the traits that people needed was to graft branches or buds taken from the parent types or varieties that had the qualities that the hybrids must acquire onto the hybrid seedlings.

    The methods Michurin used to cultivate hybrid plants were extremely diverse. His starting point was that the occurrence of new traits or the appearance of parental traits that people needed was not determined by one factor, but by the sum of many factors.

    Michurin gave great importance to the influence of soil, climatic conditions, and various factors. It is worth noting that he published many principled opinions on the impact of electricity on the development of organisms, as well as opinions on many other issues.

    In short, the large number of varieties Michurin obtained are the result of a combination of carefully considered hybridization methods and cultivation methods.

    He regularly formed, controlled, and endowed organisms obtained through distant hybridization with the traits and characteristics that people needed.

    The new methods formulated by I.V. Michurin raised biological science to the level of a creative, effective, and truly revolutionary science.

    Michurin formulated a rigorous and thorough system of methods for transforming organic nature, ascertained the basic factors affecting the life activities and development of organisms in the course of his many years of experimental work, and thereby also revealed the causes of development in the biological world.

    What theoretical conclusions can be drawn from Michurin's working methods and the results of his actual experimental activities?

    Michurin convincingly proved by using appropriate environmental conditions to act on organisms to cause hybrid organisms with certain characteristics to mutate, that their survival and development are directly dependent on the conditions surrounding them. The living conditions and genetic basis of organisms determine their qualities and characteristics, and control the process of development and speciation. The type of organism, the composition of its internal structure, as well as the phenomena of diversity, physiological processes, and biochemical processes, are all formed under the influence of living conditions. This is the first and most general conclusion made by Michurin.

    From his experimental research work, from the practice of obtaining new small types of plants, Michurin made the most important summary about the genetic characteristics of organisms.

    Experience has proved that heredity is not a characteristic inherent in certain particles of the organism, it is not eternally immutable; the heredity of the organism is a characteristic of the entire organism, and it is formed in the endless generations of this organism. This is not a process of mechanical inheritance of traits and characteristics from generation to generation, but rather these traits are formed on the basis of the historical path experienced by each branch of the organism and depend on the conditions in which each organism is located.

    Michurin concluded that heredity, formed and consolidated in the historical development process of the organism, is a solid foundation in the development of generations.

    Heredity is constantly changing and forming, but only when it is based on and related to the history of the development of this species.

    Michurin's theory of heredity is of great significance both for implementing the cultivation of new organisms and for explaining the development process of the organic world.

    In addition to genetic characteristics, there is the most important category of variability in the biological world. Heredity and variability are a unified process in the development of the biological world. Therefore, they can only be explained by viewing them as a unity of the two aspects of the same development process in the biological world.

    The problem of species and the resulting task - controlling the process of speciation - is one of the concrete theoretical problems of biology.

    The materialist understanding of the biological world leads to the conclusion that a species is a qualitatively special stage in the development of the biological world, a link in the endless long chain of historically formed organism types.

    For this reason, Michurin raised and solved extremely complex tasks. His starting point was that, under human intervention, it is possible to obtain in a short period of time some types that nature itself cannot create or that would take thousands of years to create. He believed that humans can change any characteristic, any organ, and any quality of plants.

    However, he never thought that he could change organisms all at once and in any aspect. In his activities, he mainly considered the characteristics of organisms and the careful methods of transmitting existing traits and accumulating new traits.

    As we have seen, Michurin's methodology is based on a deep understanding of the process of speciation under natural conditions. He created new types, utilizing the traits and characteristics historically formed by species, and accumulated new traits through the influence of living conditions, and fixed them in the process of artificial selection, forming species with new properties.

    New types and new species can be obtained in a short period of time, and new species with characteristics different from the existing characteristics of the first generation can be produced from the already formed new individuals.

    This is Michurin's view on species and the process of speciation. This is the theoretical position he reached as a result of his practical and experimental activities. (Special contribution to this newspaper)

    伊·弗·米丘林——为自然科学中的唯物主义路线而斗争的战士
    苏联科学院院士　尼·齐津
    今年，苏维埃国家的科学界也像世界上其他许多国家的科学界一样，纪念伊·弗·米丘林诞生一百周年。米丘林的名字在自然科学史和现代科学中占了一个显著的地位。它同达尔文、巴斯德、季米里雅泽夫、巴甫洛夫这样一些伟大的名字并列。
    在自然科学中，米丘林是争取实现唯物主义路线的积极的战士，他一生无情地揭破了科学中各种唯心主义的和形而上学的曲解。米丘林对他自己积累的大量实验材料的深刻的理论总结，使他确定了植物有机体发展中的许多最重要的规律性，并向研究者提出了有助于创造新类型的农作物和牲畜的一些新方法。在创造果树和浆果的新类型和新品种方面，米丘林的实践活动也像理论工作一样，都在生物学一切部门留下了深刻的烙印。因此，“按照米丘林的方式工作”这句话现在在自然科学中已成为一个术语了。“按照米丘林的方式工作”这个原则的出发点是：第一，以彻底的唯物主义的态度对待所研究的对象，掌握分析自然现象的过程和规律性的辩证方法。第二，有效地利用被研究的对象，不是为研究而研究，而是为了改造它们，为人类社会谋取利益。
    创造新的研究方法，根据有机体和环境之间不可分割的统一与它们的矛盾的原则创造影响有机体本性的深刻而完善的方法，是米丘林的科学和实践活动中最有代表性的特点。
    自然科学发展中的米丘林时代是同社会生活中的新的变革、同社会主义时代密切联系着的。
    由于十月社会主义革命的缘故在我国实现的革命性的变革，改变了科学的社会作用。社会的革命性的变革，提出了改造自然的任务，并向科学提出了新的要求。米丘林在十月革命以后的生活时期中，正是适应这种要求，创造了改造植物本性的有效方法，育成了果树、浆果和其他植物的最优良的类型，作出了极其杰出的理论总结。米丘林正是这样在原则上是新的理论的基础上，开始了生物科学发展的新时代。
    达尔文在向揭示生物界的规律的道路上走了十分重要的第一步。他揭示了和令人信服地证明了生物界发展的一般状况，彻底驳斥了对于生物界的形而上学和唯心主义观点，以新的认识生物界的历史方法武装了科学。但是达尔文没有能够作出在科学中同样重要的下一个步骤，即不能阐明发展的原因，也像他没有能够提出控制生物界的问题一样。
    米丘林的伟大处就是在于：他把正确理解生物界发展的规律性同经常寻求和运用影响生物界的新的方式、方法和手段密切地结合起来了。他总是使理论同实践相适应，并在实践中检验理论。
    米丘林虽然很注意理论研究，但他不是从书本上钻研辩证法原理而走向唯物主义辩证法的，而是从自己的实践活动，从同自然界的经常联系、理解它的规律性并探讨影响自然界的方法走向唯物主义辩证法的。
    大家都知道，米丘林不是一开始就走上了改造有机体本性的正确途径，而是走过一段漫长而复杂的探求新方法的道路，经历过成功的欢乐和失败的痛苦的。作为一个坦率诚恳的研究者，米丘林自己指出，在最初十五年的活动中，不正确的理论立场和由此产生的实践方法，是他的错误见解的原因和结果。
    在这段活动时期，他既没有明确的理论，也没有把方法弄清楚，而只有清楚地规定下来的任务。在这个寻求影响生物界的新方法的转变时期，他用播种种籽和选择最优苗木的方法研究了风土驯化，研究了逐步风土驯化和近亲杂交的方法。
    米丘林根据自己的知识和经验，终于坚决地转而采取了远缘杂交的方法，并把这个方法同其他选种方法、培育杂种苗木、无性杂交等结合起来。异种异属植物间的远缘杂交方法，是他的工作中的主要方法。他培育的品种的绝大部分都是用这种方法创造出来的。　　伊·弗·米丘林的一切实践活动和他的理论总结，证明了这种方法对于选种的巨大意义。下列事实就证明了这点：米丘林得到的三百多种果树和浆果植物的新的类型，大多是运用远缘杂交（异种异属之间的交配）方法获得的，或者是同一个种的范围内，但它们的亲本组按其起源来说是属于不同的生态地理区域的亲本的种内杂种。
    米丘林和他的继承者在远缘杂交的基础上解决了把果树和浆果植物推移到苏维埃国家北部地区——西伯利亚和乌拉尔等地去的最重要问题。米丘林培养出了巨大数量的梨、樱桃、李子、树莓、黑莓和葡萄的新品种。他所培养的六十三种各种果树和浆果植物的最好品种，都列为苏联的标准品种，其中有二十二种苹果，七种梨，七种樱桃，六种李子，两种杏，三种树莓，三种醋栗，七种葡萄以及其他等等。
    承认远缘杂交在米丘林的工作中的重要性，丝毫也不意味着米丘林仅限于这些方法。
    他在走上远缘杂交的道路以后，也把一些新的、在他以前从未有过的改造有机体本性的方法和措施纳入了自己的体系。
    幼小杂种植物在生存条件影响下，遗传性发生变异的事实，是米丘林选择方法的原理之一。
    米丘林用杂交方法大大改变了有机体的遗传基础。他用为杂种植物的发展提供适当的条件的方法，控制它们的品质和特点的显性。
    米丘林并不认为使两种有机体交配或接合就够了，取得新品种的任务就已经解决了。对杂种后代的进一步工作、它们的定向培育，在米丘林的远缘杂交体系中占着重要的地位。
    如果说杂交是米丘林广泛研究类型形成过程的开始阶段，那末杂种培育就是新有机体形成的完成阶段。
    米丘林培育果树苗木具有人们所需要的性状的有效方法之一就是：将具有必须使杂种获得的那些性质的亲本类型或本品种植株上取下来的枝条或幼芽嫁接到杂种苗木上去。
    米丘林所采用的培育杂种植物的方法是极其多种多样的。他的出发点是：不论是新特征的发生或者是人们所需要的亲本特征的出现，都不是一种因素决定的，而是许多种因素的总和所决定的。
    米丘林给予土壤、气候条件、各种因素的影响以很大地位，其中值得注意的是，他发表了关于电对有机体发育的影响的许多原理的意见，以及其他许多问题的意见。
    总之，米丘林所取得的为数众多的品种，是经过周密考虑的杂交方法和培育方法相结合的结果。
    他使由于远缘杂交而得到的有机体规律地形成，控制它，并使它具有人们所需要的性状和特征。
    伊·弗·米丘林所制定的新方法，把生物科学提高到创造性的、有效的、真正革命的科学的水平。
    米丘林制定了改造有机本性的严整而彻底的方法体系，在自己多年的实验工作过程中查明了影响有机体生命活动和发展的基本因素，从而同时也揭示了生物界发展的原因。
    从米丘林的工作方法和他实际从事实验活动的结果中得出什么样的理论总结呢？
    米丘林用适当的环境条件作用于有机体的方法使具有一定特性的杂种有机体发生变异，以此令人信服地证明，它们的生存和发展是直接依赖于它们周围的条件的。有机体的生存条件和遗传基础决定着它的品质和特性，控制着发展和物种形成的过程。有机体的类型、它的内部结构的组成、也和多样性现象、生理过程以及生物化学过程一样，都是在生存条件的影响下形成的。这就是米丘林做出的第一个也是最普遍的结论。
    米丘林从自己的实验研究工作中，从取得新的植物小类型的实践中，做出了关于有机体遗传特性的最重要的总结。
    经验证明，遗传性不是有机体的某种微粒所固有的特性，它不是永恒不变的；有机体的遗传性是整个有机体的特性，它是在这种生物的无穷尽的世代中形成的。这并不是特征和性状机械地代代相传的过程，而是这些性状在各该生物枝脉所经历的历史道路的基础上并依赖各该有机体所处的那些条件而形成了特性。
    米丘林得出结论：在该种有机体的历史发育过程中形成和巩固起来的遗传性，是世世代代的发展中的坚固基础。
    遗传性在不断改变和形成，但是只有在以这个种的发展的历史为基础并与之相联系才是这样。
    米丘林的遗传理论，它无论对于实施培育新的有机体，或是对于解释有机界的发展过程，都有巨大的意义。
    除了遗传特性以外，是生物界的变异性这一最重要的范畴。　　遗传性和变异性是生物界发展中的统一的过程。因此，只有把它们作为生物界同一个发展过程的两个方面的统一体来看，才能加以解释。
    物种问题和由此产生的任务——控制物种形成的过程，是生物学的具体的理论问题之一。
    从对生物界的唯物主义理解中得出结论：种——这是生物界发展中一个质上特殊的阶段，是历史上形成的有机体类型的无穷尽的长链中的一个环节。
    由于这个缘故，米丘林提出并解决了极其复杂的任务。他的出发点是：在人类的干预下，能够在短时期内得到这样一些类型，这些类型是自然界本身不能创造或者需要几千年才能创造出来的。他认为，人类能够改变植物的任何特性、任何器官和任何品质。
    但是，他从来没想能够一下子，并且在任何一个方面改变有机体。在他的活动中，主要是考虑有机体的特点，考虑传递已有性状和积累新性状的周密的方法。
    正如我们所看到的，米丘林在自己的方法论中是以对自然条件下物种形成过程的深刻理解为根据的。他创造了新的类型，利用物种在历史上形成的性状和特征，并通过生存条件的影响的方法积累了新的特征，在人工选择的过程中把它们固定下来，形成具有新的性质的物种。
    新的类型和新的物种是可以在短期内得到的，从已经形成的新的个体可以产生新的物种，这种新物种具有与第一代已有的特征不同的特征。
    这就是米丘林对于物种和物种形成过程的观点。这就是他由于自己的实践和实验活动的结果而达到的理论立场。　（本报特约稿）
