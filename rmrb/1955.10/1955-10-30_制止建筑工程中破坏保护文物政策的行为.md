    Stop Acts of Destroying Cultural Relics Protection Policies in Construction Projects
    To the Editor:
    I want to expose the actions of the Luoyang Local State-Owned Brick and Tile Factory in destroying cultural relics during basic construction projects.
    Qingtaizhong, located on the southern slope of Beiman Mountain in Luoyang City, is a region densely populated with ancient tombs. In February of this year, the Luoyang Local State-Owned Brick and Tile Factory decided to build 22 new kilns near Qingtaizhong. Before the start of construction, the Second Team of the Henan Provincial Cultural Relics Work Team repeatedly requested that they do a good job of prospecting for ancient tombs and protecting cultural relics when building the kilns, and put forward specific suggestions to ensure the quality of kiln construction, excavate ancient tombs, and handle cultural relics. However, the factory refused the suggestions of the Cultural Relics Work Team simply to avoid excavation expenses; the Luoyang Municipal Bureau of Industry also supported their erroneous opinions. Despite repeated consultations, no agreement was reached. Later, the factory only prospected around the kiln walls and then began construction. During construction, many ancient tombs were constantly discovered. The Cultural Relics Work Team sent people to rescue cultural relics, but the factory refused on the grounds that it was "afraid of delaying the project," and insisted that the workers continue construction. As a result, a large number of cultural relics were destroyed. According to preliminary statistics, 85 ancient tombs from the Zhou, Han, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties were damaged. Although hundreds of ancient artifacts, such as Zhou dynasty bronzes and Tang and Song dynasty porcelains, have been donated to the state by workers or rescued by the Second Team of the Provincial Cultural Relics Work Team, many more ancient artifacts have not been cleared out, resulting in huge losses.
    Due to the Luoyang Local State-Owned Brick and Tile Factory's failure to pay attention to excavating ancient tombs during basic construction, collapses constantly occurred during construction, affecting the quality of kiln construction. For example, the fifth and sixth kilns continuously collapsed when digging to the bottom of the kiln; the sixteenth and eighteenth kilns had to be stopped during construction because the tomb pits were too large; after the thirteenth and fourteenth kilns were built, they were loaded with brick blanks but had not yet begun to be fired, and the kiln body collapsed due to the soft foundation, burying all the brick blanks inside. According to statistics, collapses caused by subsidence of ancient tombs resulted in nine kiln loads of brick blanks becoming waste products.
    I believe that the Luoyang Municipal Bureau of Industry's directly subordinate Local State-Owned Brick and Tile Factory's erroneous behavior of not valuing the cultural heritage of the motherland and violating the policy of protecting cultural relics is serious. I hope that the relevant leading organs will inspect and handle this incident.

### 制止建筑工程中破坏保护文物政策的行为

    制止建筑工程中破坏保护文物政策的行为编辑同志：
    我要揭发洛阳地方国营砖瓦窑厂在基本建设工程中破坏文物的行为。
    洛阳市北邙山南麓青台塚，是一个古墓稠密的地区。今年二月间，洛阳地方国营砖瓦窑厂确定在青台塚附近新建窑厂二十二座。开始施工以前，河南省文物工作队第二队曾多次要求他们在建窑的时候，作好铲探古墓、保护文物的工作，并且提出保证建窑质量和发掘古墓、处理文物的具体意见。但是，厂方只是为了不出发掘经费，拒绝了文物工作队的意见；洛阳市工业局也支持他们的错误意见。虽然经过多次协商，仍然没有结果。以后，厂方只在窑壁外铲探了一圈，就施工了。在施工中，不断发现很多古墓，文物工作队派人抢救文物，厂方却用“怕误了工程”为理由加以拒绝，硬叫工人继续施工。因此，大批文物遭受了破坏，据初步统计，挖坏了周、汉、唐、宋、元各代的古墓八十五座；虽然有周代的铜器，唐、宋的瓷器等数百件古物已经由工人捐献给国家或由省文物工作队第二队抢救出来了，但是还有很多古物没有能清理出来，损失巨大。
    洛阳地方国营砖瓦窑厂在基本建设工程中由于不注意发掘古墓，施工中不断发生崩塌事件，影响了建窑工程的质量。例如，第五号、第六号窑在挖筑到窑底的时候，连续发生崩塌事件；第十六号、第十八号窑在施工中，发现墓坑太大，只好停工；第十三号、第十四号窑造好后，装上了砖坯还没有开始烧，由于基础太软，窑身塌陷，砖坯全部被埋在里面。据统计，由于古墓下陷造成崩塌事件，就造成九窑砖坯成为废品。
    我认为，洛阳市工业局直属地方国营砖瓦窑厂这种不重视祖国文化遗产、违反保护文物政策的错误行为是严重的。希望有关领导机关对这个事件进行检查和处理。　黄士斌
