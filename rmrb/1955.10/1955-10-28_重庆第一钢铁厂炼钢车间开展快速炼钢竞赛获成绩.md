    Chongqing No. 1 Steel Plant's steelmaking workshop launched a quick steelmaking competition, creating a new record of only 3 hours and 15 minutes per open-hearth furnace, shortening the original smelting time by a quarter. In September, in addition to fully completing the national plan, it also produced an additional 300 tons of steel.
    In October, as the competition continued, Zhang Wenjin's team in the small steelmaking workshop created a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in 3 hours and 10 minutes. In the first half of October, the large steelmaking workshop had completed 70 percent of the monthly plan, with a quality rate reaching 99.3 percent. The steelmaking workshop employees unanimously pledged to increase steel production by 160 tons, save more than 46,000 yuan, and fully complete all targets in October.
