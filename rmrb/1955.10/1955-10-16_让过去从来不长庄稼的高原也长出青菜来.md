Let the Plateau Where Crops Have Never Grown Before Grow Vegetables
To the Editor:
    I want to report something happy – we have successfully grown vegetables in Guoluo!
    Growing vegetables seems like an ordinary thing, but in our Guoluo, it is very difficult. Guoluo is located on the border of Qinghai, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces. The terrain is generally between 3,000 and 5,000 meters above sea level, and our residence is about 4,000 meters above sea level. The weather here is very cold and unpredictable, so people can't live without cotton clothes all year round. The Tibetan herdsmen living here have never grown grains or vegetables. After we arrived in Guoluo in 1952, we never planted anything either. It's not that we didn't want to plant, but we weren't sure. For example, the highland barley we fed the horses in the past two years fell on the ground. Although it grew later, it did not blossom or bear seeds. Therefore, most people think that nothing can be grown here. In recent years, due to transportation, we have not been able to eat green vegetables in Guoluo.
    This year, the higher authorities shipped a lot of vegetable seeds from the mainland and called for trial planting of green vegetables. At the beginning, no one was sure, but they planted the vegetable seeds with a "let's try" attitude. In order to prevent the vegetable seeds from freezing, everyone applied plenty of sheep manure. Just a few days after planting the vegetable seeds, there were several light snowfalls. At this time, the comrades started arguing, and many people were worried that the planted vegetables would be frozen. Who knew that the vegetables began to sprout half a month later, and green stars were scattered across the black and yellow land; after another ten days or so, the vegetables grew vigorously and pleasingly.
    When we first ate the green vegetables we grew ourselves, the comrades' excitement was indescribable. Everyone felt extremely happy and proud to have grown green vegetables for the first time in this area.
    The success of this trial planting of green vegetables greatly boosted our confidence. We have worked hard to reclaim more wasteland on this plateau, and we are more carefully cultivating the vegetables we have planted. Now, many vegetables have grown to two feet tall, and a large cabbage weighs a full three kilograms. We will continue to work hard to make this plateau, where crops have never grown before, grow more and better green vegetables!

### 让过去从来不长庄稼的高原也长出青菜来

    让过去从来不长庄稼的高原也长出青菜来编辑同志：
    我要报告一件令人高兴的事——我们在果洛试种蔬菜成功了！
    种菜，似乎是一件平常事；但在咱们果洛，却是很困难的事。果洛位于青海、甘肃、四川三省的边境，地势一般都在海拔三千公尺到五千公尺，我们的驻地就在海拔四千公尺左右。这里天气很冷，并且变化莫测，所以人们常年都离不了棉衣。生活在这里的藏族牧民们从来没有种过谷物和蔬菜。一九五二年，咱们到了果洛后，也从来没有种过东西。不是咱们不想种，而是没有把握。像前两年咱们喂马的青稞有些掉在地里，以后虽然长出来了，但是却不开花、不结籽。因此，一般人都认为：这里啥也种不成。几年来，由于交通关系，我们在果洛也没有吃到过青菜。
    今年，上级从内地运来了很多菜籽，号召试种青菜。开始，谁都没有把握，只是在“试试看”的心情下把菜籽种上了。为了怕菜种冻坏，大家把羊粪上得足足的。刚把菜种上不几天，连着就是几场小雪。这下子同志们可吵开了，不少人都发愁种的菜要给冻坏了。谁知道半个月以后菜开始冒芽了，黑黄的土地上星星点点地散布着绿的星星；再过十来天，菜就长得茁壮喜人了。
    当我们第一次吃到自己种的青菜时，同志们那股高兴劲儿真无法形容。大家都为在这个地区史无前例地种出青菜而感到无比的幸福和自豪。
    这次试种青菜的成功，大大地鼓舞了我们的信心。我们又辛勤地在这高原上开垦更多的荒地，并且更加细心地培育着我们所种的菜。现在，不少菜已经长得二尺高，白菜大的一棵足足有三斤重。我们还要继续努力，使这个过去从来不长庄稼的高原上长出更多更好的青菜来！
