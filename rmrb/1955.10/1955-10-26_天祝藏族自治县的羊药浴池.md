    Sheep Dip Pool in Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County
    Yan Shugui
    Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County is located in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province and is an excellent pastoral area. The people of the five ethnic groups, Tibetan, Tu, Han, Hui, and Mongolian, who live here mostly make their living by animal husbandry. In order to help herdsmen develop production, the People's Government built China's first sheep dip pool in the Zhaxi Xiulong grassland in 1952 to prevent and control ectoparasites on sheep. The buildings and working area of this sheep dip pool cover more than 4,000 square meters, and there is also a grassland of 25 square li. The bath can accommodate 45 sheep walking side by side at the same time. In normal weather, 6,000 to 7,000 sheep can be bathed in medicine a day.
    The main ectoparasites of sheep in Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County are sheep lice and sheep keds. These parasites have a strong reproductive capacity. Once attached to a sheep, they develop in patches. They suck the sheep's blood, making the sheep weak. Therefore, many sheep often die in cold weather because they cannot withstand it. At the same time, these parasites also damage the quality and quantity of sheep wool. The establishment of the medicated bath has successfully solved this problem. The medicated bath work started in 1953, and nearly 150,000 sheep have been bathed in medicine this year, with good results. Thirty minutes after the medicated bath, all sheep lice and sheep keds were killed, and they are not infected for half a year. The winter and spring mortality rate has been greatly reduced, ensuring the development of livestock.
    The role of medicated bathing in protecting the health of sheep has aroused great interest among herdsmen, and many distant herdsmen have also driven their flocks to medicated baths. Songshan in the second district of Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County is 180 li away from the medicated bath, and it takes 20 days to go back and forth. However, the number of sheep coming to the medicated bath has increased significantly. In 1953, only 2,000 sheep came to the medicated bath, but this year it has increased to 20,000. The service area of the medicated bath is also expanding. In the first year, it only covered three districts of Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, but now it has expanded to five districts, as well as one district of Yongdeng County.

    天祝藏族自治县的羊药浴池
    燕树桂
    天祝藏族自治县位于甘肃省的河西走廊，是一个优良的牧区。居住在这里的藏、土、汉、回、蒙等五个民族的人民，大都以畜牧业为生。人民政府为了扶助牧民发展生产，一九五二年在抓喜秀龙草原上修建了我国第一个羊药浴池，防治羊身上的体外寄生虫。这个羊药浴池的建筑物和工作用地约有四千多平方公尺，还有二十五平方华里大的一个草原。浴池可同时容纳四十五只羊并行走过。正常天气，一天可药浴六千到七千只羊。
    天祝藏族自治县的羊体外寄生虫主要是羊虱和羊虱蝇。这些寄生虫繁殖能力很强，一附在羊身上就成片地发展，它们吮吸羊的血液，使羊的肌体瘦弱不堪。所以，许多羊在天气寒冷时，常因支持不住而死亡。同时，这些寄生虫还损害着羊毛的质量和数量。药浴池的建立，顺利地解决了这个问题。药浴工作是从一九五三年开始的，到今年共药浴了近十五万只羊，效果良好。药浴后三十分钟，羊虱和羊虱蝇全部被杀死，而且半年内不感染，冬春死亡率大大减少，保证了牲畜的发展。
    药浴工作在保护羊只健康中所起的作用，引起牧民很大的兴趣，许多远道的牧民也赶着羊群来药浴。天祝藏族自治县二区松山，距离药浴池有一百八十华里，来回一次需要二十天。但是药浴的羊只还是大量增加。一九五三年只有二千只羊赶来药浴，今年就增加到二万只。药浴池服务的面积也在扩大，开始的一年只有天祝藏族自治县的三个区，现在发展到五个区，还有永登县的一个区。
