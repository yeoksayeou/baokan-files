    Chinese Art Troupe Performs in Turin
    The Chinese Art Troupe, currently on a visit to Italy, arrived in Turin, a major industrial city in northern Italy, on October 6th and performed on the evening of the 7th. Several days before, tickets for the troupe's scheduled performance at the Teatro Filodrammatici, which has more than two thousand seats, were sold out. At the request of the public, the theater had to sell nearly a thousand standing tickets.
    On the evening of the 7th, the Teatro Filodrammatici was packed with spectators. Thunderous applause erupted in the hall at the end of each performance. At the final ending, the storm of applause turned into cheers. To thank the audience for their love of Chinese dramatic art, the final section of "Yandang Mountain" was re-performed after the entire cast took several curtain calls. Even at one o'clock in the morning, many spectators were still waiting outside the theater to cheer the actors. Turin's literary and art circles believe this is the most glorious victory of dramatic art here in many years.
    On the morning of the 7th, Turin Mayor Amilcare Pio Pella received Zhao Feng, the deputy head of the Chinese Art Troupe, and Zhou Junliang, the secretary-general, as well as the main actors. Pella and Zhao Feng expressed their wish to develop cultural exchanges between China and Italy and to promote friendly relations between the two peoples, and exchanged gifts.
    During its one-day stay in Turin, the Chinese Art Troupe also had friendly meetings with Turin's cultural, artistic, and scientific circles. Before the performance on the 7th, Deputy Head Zhao Feng received Turin's social celebrities, including Mario Allara, the president of the University of Turin, Antonio Rossi, a member of the Chamber of Deputies, and many other famous people from the cultural and educational circles. The guests expressed their warm congratulations on the success of the Chinese Art Troupe's performance in Italy and emphasized the significance of this tour in promoting mutual understanding between the Chinese and Italian peoples.

    我国艺术团在国外
    中国艺术团到都灵演出
    目前正在意大利作访问演出的中国艺术团十月六日抵达意大利北部工业重镇都灵，并在七日晚作了演出。还在好几天以前，中国艺术团预定在那里上演的、有两千多个座位的菲莱莉剧院的戏票就被抢购一空。在群众的要求下，剧院不得不加售站票近一千张。
    七日晚间演出时，菲莱莉剧院大厅中挤满了观众。每一个节目结束时大厅里都迸发出雷动的掌声。最后结束时，暴风雨般的掌声更转为欢呼。为了答谢观众对中国戏剧艺术的热爱，在全体演员多次总谢幕后，又重演了雁荡山结尾的一段。直到深夜一时，剧院门外还有许多观众等候向演员欢呼致意。都灵文艺界认为这是此间许多年以来戏剧艺术的最辉煌的胜利。
    七日上午，都灵市长阿米贝奥·佩朗接见了中国艺术团副团长赵沨和秘书长周君亮及主要演员。佩朗和赵沨相互表示了发展中意两国文化交流和增进两国人民间的友好关系的愿望，并且互赠了礼品。
    中国艺术团在都灵停留的一天中还同都灵文化、艺术、科学界作了友好的会见。七日演出开始前，副团长赵沨接待了都灵社会名流，其中有都灵大学校长马里奥·阿莱拉、下议院议员安东尼奥·罗西欧以及其他文化教育界著名人士多人。客人们对中国艺术团在意大利演出获得的成功表示热烈祝贺，并且强调指出这次旅行演出对促进中意两国人民间的相互了解的意义。　　　　　（新华社）
