To the Editor:

We have a "Three No Knows" deputy district committee secretary here. He is Li Chongyao, Deputy Secretary of the Xinyuan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Siyang County.

One day in September, three comrades from the county committee's inspection team came to inspect the Mid-Autumn Festival pre-distribution work. When they found Deputy Secretary Li, who was responsible for overseeing the district's Mid-Autumn Festival pre-distribution work, he was leisurely lying in bed listening to songs.

The three comrades asked Deputy Secretary Li to talk about the progress of the Mid-Autumn Festival pre-distribution work. Deputy Secretary Li simply replied "I don't know"; his reason being: "The townships have not reported on the progress of the district's pre-distribution work recently, and I have not had time to go down to inspect."

Deputy Secretary Li was also responsible for overseeing a key area – Lutang Township. When asked about the pre-distribution situation in Lutang Township, he replied that he was "not very clear" either; his reason being "I've been in Datong Cooperative these past few days."

"Then please talk about the key pilot program of pre-distribution work in Datong Cooperative. Didn't the district committee want you to go back and introduce your experience at the joint meeting of township branch secretaries?"

"Um..." Deputy Secretary Li couldn't speak, and finally stuttered, "The pre-distribution work of the Datong Agricultural Production Cooperative hasn't started yet! I've been feeling dizzy for the past ten days or so, and just want to sleep."

In that case, the comrades of the inspection team had no choice but to report their inspection findings to Deputy Secretary Li: Of the 98 old cooperatives in the district, 78 had not yet carried out pre-distribution as of September 5th. According to the statistics of 18 cooperatives, due to the untimely pre-distribution and poor grain storage, a total of 26,537 jin of corn and beans were discolored, deteriorated, moldy, and sprouted due to rain. In Huacheng Cooperative in Lutang Township, which was overseen by Deputy Secretary Li, 3,300 jin of corn had deteriorated.

After hearing this long report, Deputy Secretary Li was shocked and said, "Goodness! So many cooperatives haven't carried out pre-distribution yet! How come I didn't know the grain was moldy? Why didn't the cooperatives report to me!"

The questions raised by Deputy Secretary Li should be answered by himself. He lives in Datong Cooperative, so why hasn't Datong Cooperative carried out pre-distribution? The Democracy and Yihe Cooperatives near Datong Cooperative have also not carried out pre-distribution, so why doesn't Deputy Secretary Li know anything about it? We should also ask Deputy Secretary Li: you occupy several rooms in Datong Cooperative as dormitories and meeting rooms..., so that the 70,000 jin of soybeans and sorghum and two stacks of wheat collected by the cooperative have to be placed outside, resulting in nearly 3,000 jin of discoloration and mildew due to the invasion of rain; you walk back and forth from the grain stack every day, so why don't you know anything about it?

Deputy Secretary Li is responsible for the mutual aid and cooperation work in the entire district (of course, District Committee Secretary Pan Jun is also responsible), and is also the resident leader of the district's central cooperative, but he actually treats work with such an attitude. If Deputy Secretary Li doesn't resolutely change his style, earnestly treat work, and actively lead farmers to take the socialist road; then, the farmers don't need such a leader who only knows how to occupy houses and sleep.

### “一问三不知”的区委副书记

    “一问三不知”的区委副书记编辑同志：
    我们这里有一个“一问三不知”的区委副书记。他就是中共泗阳县新元区区委副书记李崇尧。
    是在九月里的一天，县委检查组的三位同志来检查中秋预分工作。当他们找到负责掌握全区中秋预分工作的李副书记的时候，李副书记正悠闲地躺在床上收听歌曲。
    这三位同志请李副书记谈谈中秋预分工作的情况。李副书记很干脆地回答说“不知道”；理由是：“全区预分工作情况，最近各乡没有汇报，我也没有空下去检查。”
    李副书记还负责掌握一个重点——芦塘乡，当问到他芦塘乡预分情况的时候，他回答的是“也不大清楚”；理由是“这几天我都在大同社”。
    “那就请你谈谈大同社的预分工作重点试办的情况吧。区委不是要你回去在乡支部书记联席会议上介绍经验吗？”
    “嗯………”李副书记说不出话来了，最后才吞吞吐吐地说：“大同农业生产合作社预分工作还没有搞呢！我近来十几天头脑昏昏的，光想睡觉。”
    既然如此，检查组的同志只好将他们的检查情况向李副书记作了汇报：全区九十八个老社，到九月五日还有七十八个社没有进行预分。据十八个社的统计，由于预分不及时，粮食保管不善，遭雨淋湿而变色、变质、霉烂、出芽的玉米、豆子共有二万六千五百三十七斤。在李副书记掌握的芦塘乡的华成社，玉米变质的就有三千三百斤。
    听了这一大串汇报，李副书记才大吃一惊地说：“乖乖！有这么多的社还没有预分呀！粮食霉烂了我怎么不知道呢？社里为什么不向我汇报啊！”
    李副书记提出的这些问题，应该由他自己来回答。他就住在大同社，为什么大同社没有预分呢？大同社附近的民主、义和两个社也没有预分，为什么李副书记也一点不知道呢？还应该问一下李副书记：你占了大同社几间房子做宿舍、会议室……，使社里收的七万斤豆子、高粱和两囤小麦只好全部放在外边，以致在阴雨的侵袭下变色、霉变近三千斤；你每天从粮囤边走来走去，为什么也不知道呢？
    李副书记负责全区互助合作工作（当然，区委书记潘钧也要负责），又是掌握区中心社的驻社领导人员，但是居然用这样的态度来对待工作。李副书记如果不痛下决心改变作风，认真对待工作，积极领导农民走社会主义的道路；那么，农民是不需要这样光知道占房子睡大觉的领导人的。
