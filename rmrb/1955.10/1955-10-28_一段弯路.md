A Detour
Wang Qing, Secretary of the CPC Yanshan County Committee, Hebei Province

Since the autumn, after Yanshan County, Hebei Province, conveyed Chairman Mao's instructions on the issue of cooperativization and vigorously publicized the Party's policies and principles regarding agricultural cooperativization to the farmers, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and peasants has been greatly enhanced. According to statistics from the end of September, 381 agricultural producers' cooperatives frameworks had been set up throughout the county, with 16,342 peasant households signing up to join. Including the old cooperative members, the proportion of peasant households joining the cooperatives has risen from 25.2% of the county's total households to 57%.

However, when the movement reached its climax, the county committee, lacking foresight and failing to make adequate preparations beforehand, did not keep up with specific organizational leadership work. Coupled with the complacency of some staff members upon seeing the movement's momentum and their "doing everything themselves" work style, which did not rely on grassroots organizations, the movement in five of the county's eight districts gradually declined. For example, in Sanlizhuang Village, District One, where the movement had been progressing well, drums and gongs had been sounding, and the blackboard bulletin was updated daily with propaganda content, with people everywhere discussing joining cooperatives. After a few days, however, it became silent, and the blackboard bulletin still displayed the previous writings. Of the 381 cooperative frameworks, only 49 had established preparatory committees and studied methods for appraising the means of production for entry into the cooperatives. The rest, unsure of how to proceed, were stuck at the registration stage. In Xilou Township, District One, five of the seven cooperatives in the process of being established were simply waiting for district and township staff to appraise the means of production. Fu Yulin, the Party branch secretary of Zhaomaotao Village, District Seven, was so worried about not understanding the methods for appraising the means of production that he cried and requested that the higher authorities assign him key personnel. In cooperatives in the process of being established in District Two, 75 landlords, rich peasants, and other impure elements had infiltrated, making it impossible for the establishment work of some cooperatives to continue. In addition, some peasants who had already registered to join the cooperatives began to feel disheartened and wavered in their thinking because the specific work of establishing the cooperatives had not kept up. There were also individual villages where backward village cadres and some well-to-do middle peasants organized fake cooperatives to go through the motions of the movement. At the same time, there were instances of forced membership in individual villages.

The above situation is serious. In order to quickly reverse this situation and promote the healthy development of the movement, the county committee, after examining and analyzing the situation and conducting repeated studies, immediately took the following measures:

1.  In accordance with Chairman Mao's principle of "overall planning and strengthened leadership," the leading ideology was examined from top to bottom in light of the current situation, so that all staff members could recognize the seriousness of the current situation; complacency and the "doing everything themselves" style of work, which did not cultivate cooperative management cadres or rely on grassroots organizations, were criticized. At the same time, eight county-level cadres were organized to go to various districts to specifically examine the problems in the movement and convey the measures currently being taken by the county committee. After ideological examination, the understanding of leaders at all levels was raised. The Party secretary of District Seven said: "I always thought that some problems were unavoidable in the movement, so I relaxed my preparations. I didn't expect the problems to become so serious. This proves that my thinking is lagging behind the movement." The next day, this district immediately convened meetings of Party members and League members at the township level to examine the problems in the cooperative establishment work. Yang Zhenzhong, the Party branch secretary of Xilou Township in District One, examined his own "doing everything themselves" work style, saying: "I used to think that village cadres lacked experience, ability, and intelligence, so I wasn't comfortable with letting anyone else handle the cooperatives. Who knew that 'a palm can't cover the sky'? I took care of the eastern cooperative, but couldn't take care of the western cooperative, and in the end, none of them were done well." The three township staff members immediately went to Gaobianwu and other villages with more serious problems to help the village branches learn how to appraise the means of production. Zhang Xiuwu, the Party branch secretary of Baizhuang Village (and the head of the old cooperative), also examined his complacency: "I helped the village set up two cooperative frameworks, and all the peasants who should have registered registered, so I thought I could relax. I didn't pay attention to helping them with specific problems. I didn't expect that they wouldn't know how to appraise the means of production." The next day, this village organized propagandists to carry out propaganda work on the methods for appraising the means of production and immediately established a preparatory committee for the cooperative to study the methods for appraising the means of production.

2.  Reorganize the propaganda teams and publicize specific policies. Because the cooperativization movement in most villages and townships had stalled, propaganda work had also stalled. In order to ensure that propaganda work kept up with the development of the movement, the county committee researched new propaganda content and distributed it to various districts. At the same time, ten county-level reporters were organized to go to various districts three times in a row to transmit the new ideas. Various districts also convened propaganda meetings at the township level, pointing out the achievements of the past work, commending activists, and researching propaganda methods for the future based on current problems. From then on, propaganda work in various places became active again, with a total of 11,699 Party members, League members, and activists participating in propaganda work throughout the county. 3,178 blackboard bulletins also changed to new propaganda content, and 2,820 loudspeakers sounded again everywhere. Three middle peasant households in Hou Dashang Village, District Ten, who had registered to join the cooperative, withdrew from the cooperative because they were afraid of suffering losses from contributing their means of production to the cooperative. After listening to the propaganda on the methods for appraising the means of production, they thought that this method was very reasonable and asked the branch to rejoin the cooperative. Che Danye, a 75-year-old man from Miaozhuangzi, District Five, said after listening to the propaganda: "I thought that once things were put into the cooperative, they would be confiscated. If you had publicized this earlier, wouldn't I have joined the cooperative at the beginning of the year?"

3.  Teach the methods of appraising the means of production to cadres at all levels who are running cooperatives, and give full play to the strength of grassroots organizations. A booklet on how to appraise the means of production for entering the cooperatives was distributed to each cooperative that was being established, and rural staff at all levels and the cooperative's key personnel were organized to study it. Ni Shulan, a county-level staff member stationed in Sunzhuang Township, District One, and Zhao Changsheng, the township Party branch secretary, and others did not dare to go to the cooperatives because they did not know how to appraise the means of production. All six cooperatives that were being established in the township were stuck at the registration stage. Later, they adopted the method of "learning, doing, and teaching simultaneously," in which they collectively studied the appraisal methods in the morning and helped the cooperative cadres study in the cooperative in the evening while carrying out practical work. In six days, the appraisal work was completed. The cooperative management cadres in Dongliuzhuang, led by Zhao Baohai, invited Dai Zhongbin, the head of the old cooperative in the village, to help with the appraisal of the means of production for entering the cooperative, and absorbed other village cadres to participate. As a result of using this method of "master leading apprentice, focusing on key areas to drive overall progress," the appraisal work of the means of production for entering the newly established cooperatives in the township was basically completed in four days.

4.  Conduct a review and clarify the confusing phenomena. Due to the wide scope and rapid pace of the movement, and insufficient preparation work, some newly established cooperatives experienced problems such as weak key personnel, ideological confusion among members, and impure motives for joining the cooperative among some people. In response to this situation, a "three-way review" of key personnel, member composition, and ideology was launched in various places. Through the review of key personnel, District Seven dealt with two fake cooperatives organized by backward village cadres and well-to-do middle peasants in collusion, and replaced eighteen cooperative management cadres with weak abilities. Through the review of member composition, District Two purged 75 landlords, rich peasants, and other impure elements from the cooperatives. Through the ideological review, District Six found that 757 of the 3,271 peasant households who had registered to join the cooperatives had wavering thoughts. After repeated education, most of these people settled down, and only a few peasants with impure motives withdrew from the cooperatives. Currently, the cooperatives that have undergone the review have been consolidated.

5.  Train cooperative management cadres and teach cooperative management methods. In order to fundamentally overcome the difficulties of weak key personnel within the cooperatives and the lack of cooperative management skills, the county recently trained 962 new cooperative management cadres in two batches. The trainees were Party members, League members, and activists with prestige among the masses. The training content included the Party Central Committee's resolution on the issue of cooperativization, Chairman Mao's instructions, and the complete set of methods for establishing cooperatives. The accountants of each cooperative also participated in the training. In this way, the accountants also understood the policies and methods for establishing cooperatives; and the general key personnel also understood the general situation of accounting work. In order to exchange experiences and improve the leadership level of full-time cooperative management cadres, the heads of eleven old cooperatives and 74 instructors stationed in districts and townships were also absorbed to participate in the training. The training also outlined the work steps after returning to the village: (1) Carry out the review of key personnel, composition, and ideology to purify and consolidate the organization; (2) Hold various symposiums to educate new members to ensure that joining the cooperative is completely voluntary; (3) Organize new members to study the various specific policies and methods for cooperative management so that the farmers joining the cooperative understand the policies and methods; (4) After the cooperative is officially established, formulate a production plan and concentrate efforts to carry out the production movement.

After implementing the above measures, the cooperativization movement in the county has once again moved to a new climax. Many peasants who have not yet registered to join the cooperative are now asking to register or establish cooperatives. The vast majority of cooperatives have completed the appraisal of the means of production for entry into the cooperative. Some new cooperatives have begun to implement collective production.

    一段弯路
    中共河北省盐山县委书记　王清
    河北省盐山县自从秋季传达了毛主席关于合作化问题的指示，大张旗鼓地向农民宣传农业合作化的方针政策以后，广大干部和农民的社会主义觉悟大大提高。据九月底统计，全县搭起了三百八十一个农业生产合作社的架子，有一万六千三百四十二户农民报名入了社。连老社员在内，入社的农户已从占全县总农户的百分之二十五点二，上升到百分之五十七。
    但是，当运动出现高潮的时候，由于县委缺乏预见性，事先没有作好准备工作，具体的组织领导工作没有跟上去；加上部分工作人员看到运动起来即产生了自满情绪和在工作中有不依靠基层组织的“包办代替”的工作作风，全县八个区已有五个区的运动逐渐走向低潮。如运动开展较好的一区三里庄村，头些天锣鼓喧天，黑板报一天一换宣传内容，人们到处在谈论入合作社的事情；过了几天，却变得鸦雀无声，黑板报上还是以前写下的字。三百八十一个社架子中，只有四十九个建立了筹备委员会，学习了评议入社的生产资料的办法，其余的由于不了解下步工作怎样进行，都停滞在报名阶段。一区西楼乡的七个正在进行建社工作的社，有五个光等着区、乡工作人员去评议生产资料。七区赵毛陶村支部书记傅玉林，因为不懂评议生产资料的办法，愁得哭起来，要求上级给调配骨干。二区的正在进行建社工作的社内，混进了七十五户地主、富农和其他不纯分子，使一部分社的建社工作无法继续进行。此外，也有些已报名入社的农民，因为建社的具体工作没有跟上去，情绪开始低落，思想发生动摇。还有个别村的落后村干部和一些富裕中农，为了敷衍运动，组织了假社。同时，有个别村发生了强迫入社现象。
    上述情况是严重的。县委为了迅速扭转这种局面，使运动健康发展，经过检查分析，反复研究，立即采取了以下措施：
    一、根据毛主席所指示的“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，对照当前情况，自上而下地检查领导思想，使全体工作人员认识当前情况的严重性；批判自满思想和不培养办社骨干、不依靠基层组织的包办代替作风。同时，组织八名县委级干部分赴各区具体检查运动中的问题，传达目前县委所采取的措施。经过检查思想，各级领导干部的认识提高了。七区区委书记说：“我总认为在运动中免不了会发生些问题，因而放松了准备工作，没想到问题会发生到这么严重。这证明咱的思想是落在运动的后头了。”这个区第二天即以乡为单位召开了党团员会，检查建社工作中的问题。一区西楼乡支部书记杨振忠检查自己的包办代替工作作风说：“我以前总认为村干部没经验，能力差、脑子笨，所以不论哪个社，非自己去搞就不放心。哪知道‘巴掌再大遮不过天’，顾了东社顾不了西社，结果现在一个也没搞好。”这个乡的三名乡工作人员，当即分头到高边务等三个问题较严重的村，帮助村支部学习评议生产资料的办法。白庄村支部书记张修五（老社的社长）也检查了自己的自满情绪：“我帮助村里搭起了两个社架子，应该报名的农民全报了名，我就认为可以松口气了，没有注意再帮助他们处理具体问题，没想到他们不会评议生产资料的办法。”这个村第二天就组织宣传员开展了评议生产资料办法的宣传工作，并且立即成立了建社的筹备委员会，学习评议生产资料的办法。
    二、重整宣传队伍，宣传具体政策。由于大部分乡村的合作化运动停顿下来，宣传工作也跟着停顿下来了。县委为了使宣传工作跟上运动的发展，研究出宣传新内容下达各区。同时，组织了十名县委级报告员，一连三次分赴各区进行传授。各区也以乡为单位召开了宣传会议，指出了过去工作的成绩，表扬了积极分子，并根据当前的问题，研究出今后宣传的办法。从此，各地的宣传工作又活跃起来，全县参加宣传工作的党员、团员和积极分子共有一万一千六百九十九名。三千一百七十八块黑板报也换了新的宣传内容，二千八百二十个广播筒又普遍响起来了。十区后大商村三户报名入社的中农，因怕生产资料入社吃亏，退出了社。听了生产资料评议办法的宣传以后，认为这办法很合理，又找支部要求再入社。五区苗庄子七十五岁的车大爷，听了宣传后说：“我当是东西入了社就充公啦，你们早宣传宣传这个，我不是年头就入了社吗？”
    三、把评议生产资料的办法教给各级办社干部，发挥基层组织的力量。发给每个正在进行建社工作的社一本关于如何评议入社生产资料的小册子，并组织各级乡村工作人员和社内骨干进行学习。驻一区孙庄乡的县级工作人员倪淑兰和乡支部书记赵长声等因为不会评议生产资料，都不敢到社里去，全乡六个正在进行建社工作的社，都停留在报名阶段。后来他们采用了早晨集体研究评议办法，晚上在社里帮助社干部学习、同时进行实际工作的“边学、边做、边教”的方法，六天时间，评议工作全部结束。东刘庄以赵保海为首的建社骨干，请了本村老社的社长戴中彬来帮助搞评议生产资料入社工作，并吸收其他村的建社骨干来参加。运用了这种“师父带徒弟、重点带全面”的办法的结果，四天时间，全乡新建社生产资料入社的评议工作都已基本结束。
    四、进行排队摸底，澄清混乱现象。由于运动的范围广、进度快，准备工作做得不够，某些新建社出现了骨干力量太弱、社员思想混乱和某些人入社动机不纯等现象。针对这种情况，发动各地进行了骨干、社员成份和思想“三排队”。七区通过骨干排队，处理了两个由落后村干部和富裕中农串通组织起来的假社；并调换了十八名能力弱的办社骨干。二区通过成份排队，把七十五户地主、富农及其他不纯分子清洗出了社。六区通过思想排队，在报名入社的三千二百七十一户农户中，检查出七百五十七户是思想发生动摇的。这些人经过反复进行教育以后，大部分安心下来，只有少数动机不纯的农民退出了社。目前经过排队的社，都已巩固。
    五、训练办社骨干，教会办社办法。为了从根本上克服社内骨干弱和不会办社的困难，最近全县前后分两批训练了新社骨干九百六十二名。训练对象是党员、团员和群众中有威信的积极分子。训练内容是党中央关于合作化问题的决议、毛主席的指示和建社的整套办法。各社会计也一同参加受训。这样，会计也懂得了政策和建社办法；一般骨干分子也了解了会计工作的概况。为了交流经验，提高办社专职干部的领导水平，还吸收了十一个老社的社长和七十四个驻区、乡的指导员参加受训。在训练中，还交代了回村后的工作步骤：（一）进行骨干、成份、思想的排队工作，以纯洁组织和巩固组织；（二）召开各种座谈会对新社员进行教育，做到入社完全自愿；（三）组织新社员学习办社的各项具体政策和办法，使入社农民人人懂政策和办法；（四）社正式成立后，即订出生产计划，集中力量开展生产运动。
    经过贯彻执行上述措施以后，目前全县的合作化运动又推向了新高潮，许多尚未报名入社的农民又纷纷要求报名入社或建社。绝大部分社已结束了评议生产资料入社的工作。一部分新社已开始实行了集体生产。
