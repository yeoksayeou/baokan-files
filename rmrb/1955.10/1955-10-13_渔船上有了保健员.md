	Health Workers on Fishing Boats

	The Kanmen District People's Government of Yuhuan County, Zhejiang Province, recently took advantage of the fishing off-season to run a training class for health workers from fishing production cooperatives. A total of 88 members of fishing cooperatives and mutual aid groups participated in the study. Many of them were young people with at least a junior primary school education, and included six primary school teachers.

	The students studied hard. Around four o'clock in the morning, some students would get up and study on the mountainside by themselves, or several people would get together to review their lessons. According to statistics from the final exam, the students' average score was 80.8 points.

	Through this study, the students' political awareness and level of health knowledge such as disease prevention and first aid for external injuries have been greatly improved. They are very grateful to the Communist Party and the People's Government. Ye Panxue, a young Communist Youth League member and fisherman, said during the study: "When I came to study, people in the cooperative said that Chairman Mao is even better than our parents. He takes care of things for us that we would never have thought of ourselves. Now we have radios, which allow us to predict the weather and protect our lives. I used to only hear that there were doctors on navy warships, but today our cooperative's fishing boats will also have health workers. We must do a good job in production and vigorously support the liberation of Taiwan."

	After the study ended, two fishing cooperatives and one mutual aid group in Qiantai Township immediately established health rooms with the help of the district health center, responsible for health knowledge propaganda and education, and general first aid for external injuries, which is very popular among the masses.

    渔船上有了保健员
    浙江沿海的玉环县坎门区人民政府最近利用渔业生产空闲时间，开办了一期渔业生产合作社保健员训练班。参加学习的共有渔业合作社社员和互助组组员八十八人，他们中很多是具有初小以上文化水平的青年人，里面还包括有六位小学教师。
    学员们都努力学习，清晨四点钟左右，有的学员就起来在山头上自学或几个人合在一起复习功课。根据结束时测验统计，学员平均考试分数是八十点八分。
    学员们通过这次学习，政治认识和预防疾病、外伤急救等卫生常识水平都大有提高。他们非常感激共产党和人民政府。学员之一的青年团员渔民叶潘学在学习中说：“我来学习时，社里人都说毛主席比爷娘还好，我们自己想不到的事情，他都替我们办起来了。现在我们已经有收音机，能够预知气象，生命有了保障；以前只听说海军兵舰上有医生，今天我们社里的渔船上也要有保健员了。我们一定要搞好生产，用劲支援解放台湾。”
    学习结束后，前台乡有两个渔业合作社和一个互助组当即在区卫生所帮助下成立了保健室，负责社里的卫生常识宣传教育和一般外伤急救工作，很受群众欢迎。　　　　（福彩）
