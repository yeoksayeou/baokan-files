Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 28th (TASS): The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the 27th to continue the election of a non-permanent member of the Security Council.

As in previous sessions, the voting took place in an atmosphere of blatant pressure exerted by the US delegation on many national delegations. The US delegation, in violation of the principles of the UN Charter and the London Agreement of the Great Powers, made every effort to have the Philippines elected. Eastern and Western European countries, as well as most countries in Asia and the Near East, supported Yugoslavia.

Three ballots were held on the 27th, and neither Yugoslavia nor the Philippines obtained the two-thirds majority required for election. The US delegation's tactics of applying pressure and "coercion" to increase the number of votes for the Philippines did not produce results favorable to the US. The Philippines did not exceed 32 votes in any of the three votes on the 27th, while in previous votes it had once obtained 38 votes.

Subsequently, British representative Dixon proposed postponing the vote for the election of a non-permanent member of the Security Council for another ten days, so that delegations could use this period to find a way to break the current deadlock. US representative Lodge opposed this proposal. The Assembly passed Dixon's proposal by a vote of 21 to 18 (with 15 abstentions). The Soviet delegation, along with many other delegations, voted in favor of the proposal, while the US delegation voted against it.

    联大关于安理会非常任理事国选举仍未获结果
    美国的阴谋继续遭到挫败
    新华社二十八日讯　塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会二十七日举行全体会议，继续选举安全理事会的一个非常任理事国。
    像在以前的会议上一样，投票是在美国代表团对许多国家代表团粗暴地施加压力的气氛中进行的。美国代表团违背联合国宪章原则和大国的伦敦协定，竭力企图使菲律宾当选。东欧和西欧各国以及亚洲和近东大多数国家支持南斯拉夫。
    二十七日举行了三次投票，南斯拉夫和菲律宾都没有获得当选所必需的三分之二多数。美国代表团为使菲律宾票数增加而采取的施加压力和“威迫”的手段也没有得到有利于美国的结果。二十七日，菲律宾三次投票中没有一次超过三十二票，而在以前几次的投票中，有一次它曾获得三十八票。
    随后，英国代表狄克逊建议把选举安全理事会非常任理事国的投票延期十天再举行，以便代表团能利用这个时期寻找打开目前僵局的途径。美国代表洛奇反对这个建议。大会以二十一票对十八票（另十五票弃权）通过狄克逊的建议。苏联代表团同其他许多代表团投票赞成这个建议，美国代表团投反对票。
