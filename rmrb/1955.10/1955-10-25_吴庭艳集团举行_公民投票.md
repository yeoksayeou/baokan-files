Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 24th: Saigon dispatch: The Ngo Dinh Diem clique held a "referendum" in some parts of South Vietnam on the 23rd to abolish Bao Dai.

    In Saigon, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's army, police, and secret agents were deployed in full force at various polling stations and main streets, as if facing a formidable enemy. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique forced all shops to close and threatened people to go to the polling stations to vote.

    Before voting, everyone had to raise their ballot high so that Ngo Dinh Diem's men could check it. If a green ballot was raised, indicating disapproval of Ngo Dinh Diem as "National Leader" or "President," the person would be arrested and threatened by the police and secret agents. According to the Dai Viet radio station, at least thirty people were arrested on the spot at polling stations in Saigon and Cholon yesterday, and one newspaper worker was even severely beaten.

    The people were very indifferent to this voting farce. Many people used various methods to refuse to go to the polling stations, so much so that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique had to send a large number of soldiers disguised as civilians to the polling stations to put on a show.

    In central and northern Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique openly dispatched troops and police to force people to vote for Ngo Dinh Diem. People were herded to polling stations in groups, but many managed to slip away.

    In areas such as Thu Duc and Hoc Mon, only a few dozen people voted in the morning, while the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's propaganda machine claimed that within a few hours, the number of people voting had reached "fifty percent" or even "one hundred percent."

    吴庭艳集团举行“公民投票”
    新华社河内二十四日电　西贡消息：吴庭艳集团二十三日在南越的一些地方举行了废除保大的“公民投票”。
    在西贡，吴庭艳集团的军队、警察和密探如临大敌地散布在各投票站和主要街道。吴庭艳集团强迫所有商店关门，威胁人民到投票站去投票。
    每个人在投票前必须把票子高高举起，以便于吴庭艳分子检查。如果举起的是绿票，即不赞成吴庭艳做“国长”或“总统”，就受到警察和密探的逮捕和威胁。据大越电台透露，昨天在西贡和堤岸，至少有三十个人在投票站当场被捕，其中有一个报社工人还遭到毒打。
    人民对这个投票把戏非常冷淡。许多人利用各种办法拒绝到投票站去，以至吴庭艳集团不得不出动大批兵士化装平民到投票站去装装场面。
    在中越各地，吴庭艳集团公开地出动军队和警察，强迫人民去投吴庭艳的票。人们被成群结队地赶到投票站去，但是有许多人设法溜了回来。
    在守德、旭门等地方，一个上午只有几十个人去投票，而吴庭艳集团的宣传机关却扬言在几个钟头内去投票的人，已经有“百分之五十”甚至“百分之百”。
