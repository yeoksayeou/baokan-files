    Industrial Production Capacity and Annual Output Are Two Different Indicators

    Many readers have written to inquire about the relationship between the increase in annual production capacity and the increase in production volume of major industrial products during the first Five-Year Plan. They say that, according to the figures listed in Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" in Part II, "Outline of the First Five-Year Plan," the two do not match. For example, trucks could not be manufactured in 1952, but the production capacity reached 30,000 vehicles within five years; however, the output in 1957 was only 4,000 vehicles, far lower than the previous figure. Another example is steel, where the increase in annual production capacity within five years was 2.53 million tons; however, the output increased from 1.35 million tons in 1952 to 4.12 million tons in 1957, an increase of 2.77 million tons, exceeding the previous figure. Therefore, these readers have asked whether there are any errors in the figures listed in the report.

    Now, we answer this question as follows:

    The figures listed in Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report have all been carefully calculated and verified and are without error. The increase in annual production capacity of major industrial products during the first Five-Year Plan and the increase in production volume in 1957 compared to 1952 cannot be directly compared; because the production capacity of industrial products and the annual output are two different concepts, two different indicators.

    The production capacity of industrial products is the designed capacity of the equipment for producing industrial products. This capacity is determined based on various technical conditions when the factory is built. Production volume refers to the actual or planned production quantity. If the industrial enterprise's production is well-organized, and the equipment capacity is fully utilized, the production volume can reach or exceed the production capacity; otherwise, the production volume will not reach the production capacity. The situation of each industrial enterprise is different. Due to factors such as raw material supply, product demand, enterprise management level, and technical level, the utilization rate of production capacity varies.

    Newly built, modern industrial enterprises, in the initial period of putting into production, due to workers not being fully familiar with the equipment performance and not being skilled enough in operation techniques, generally speaking, the production volume is difficult to reach the production capacity in the short term. Therefore, in the Five-Year Plan, on the one hand, it is necessary to calculate clearly the production capacity increased by the industrial enterprises that have been completed within five years. On the other hand, it is also necessary to plan the production volume that can be reached within five years. In this case, the latter is necessarily lower than the former. The reason why the production capacity of trucks in 1957 was 30,000 vehicles, while the planned output was only 4,000 vehicles, is for this reason.

    The increase in annual production capacity stipulated in the Five-Year Plan refers to the capacity of newly built and renovated industrial enterprises that are completed or partially completed and put into production within five years. It does not include the production capacity increased by the original industrial enterprises through technical and organizational measures to tap production potential, nor does it deduct the production capacity of the original industrial enterprises that has been scrapped due to equipment wear and tear and inability to continue use. This point has been clearly stated in Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report. Therefore, the production capacity in 1952 plus the production capacity increased within five years is not equal to the production capacity in 1957. The reason why the growth figure of the annual output of steel within five years exceeds the increase figure of the annual production capacity within five years is because the production capacity of the original enterprises has also increased.

### 工业品的生产能力和年产量是两种不同的指标

    工业品的生产能力和年产量是两种不同的指标
    很多读者来信对第一个五年计划中主要工业品五年内增加的年产能力和五年内增长的产量之间的关系提出了询问。他们说：根据李富春副总理“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”第二部分“第一个五年计划概要”中列举的数字，两者之间就不相符合。例如，载重汽车在一九五二年还不能制造，五年内达到的生产能力为三万辆；但是一九五七年的产量却只有四千辆，大大低于前面的数字。又如钢，五年内增加的年产能力为二百五十三万吨；但是产量却从一九五二年的一百三十五万吨增加到一九五七年的四百十二万吨，即增加了二百七十七万吨，超过了前面的数字。因此，这些读者提出，是不是在报告中所列举的数字有错误。
    现在，我们对这个问题答复如下：
    李富春副总理报告中所列举的数字都经过精确的计算和核对，是没有错误的。第一个五年计划中规定的主要工业品在五年内增加的年产能力和一九五七年比一九五二年增加的生产量，两者是不能直接比较的；因为工业品的生产能力和年产量是两个不同的概念，两种不同的指标。
    工业产品的生产能力就是生产工业产品的设备的设计能力，这种能力是在建厂时根据各种技术条件计算确定的，而生产量是指实际的或计划达到的生产数量。如果工业企业生产组织得合理，设备能力得到了充分的发挥，生产量就可以达到或超过生产能力；反之，生产量就达不到生产能力。各个工业企业的情况不同，由于原料供应、产品需要、企业管理水平和技术水平等因素的影响，生产能力的利用率是有高有低的。
    新建的现代化的工业企业，在投入生产的初期，由于工人对设备性能还不能完全熟悉，操作技术还不够熟练，一般说，生产量在短期内是很难达到生产能力的。因此，在五年计划中，一方面需要计算清楚五年内已经建设完成的工业企业所增加的生产能力，另一方面也需要计划出在五年内可以达到的生产量。在这种情况下，后者必然是低于前者的。载重汽车在一九五七年的生产能力是三万辆，而计划产量只有四千辆，就是这个缘故。
    五年计划中规定的五年内增加的年产能力，是指新建的和改建的工业企业在五年内建设完工或部分完工而投入生产的能力，并不包括原有工业企业经过采取技术组织措施、发挥生产潜力而增加的生产能力，也没有扣除原有工业企业因为设备磨损、不能继续使用而报废的生产能力。这一点，在李富春副总理的报告中已经说得很清楚。因此，一九五二年的生产能力加上五年内增加的生产能力，是不等于一九五七年的生产能力的。钢在五年内年产量的增长数字所以超过五年内年产能力的增加数字，就是因为原有企业的生产能力也有了增加。
