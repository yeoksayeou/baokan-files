Shandong State-Owned Farms Achieve Bumper Harvests in Both Wheat and Autumn Seasons

    This year, the 138 state-owned farms in Shandong Province achieved bumper harvests in both the wheat and autumn seasons. The total grain production is expected to exceed 11 million jin, with an average yield of 270 jin per mu, surpassing last year's unit yield by 2.5%. The increase in cotton production is even more significant, with a total expected production of over 390,000 jin of ginned cotton, averaging over 66 jin per mu, which is double the average cotton yield of the province this year.

    In the past two years, Shandong's state-owned farms have achieved successive bumper harvests, gradually reversing the previous losses. Last year, the farms across the province accumulated more than 240,000 yuan of wealth for the country, and it is estimated that this year's surplus will increase by more than 60,000 yuan compared to last year.

    The farms' bumper harvests have set an example for the surrounding farmers. This summer, some areas of Shandong Province experienced drought. Thanks to the timely irrigation and strengthened management by the farms, the autumn crops still grew vigorously. Some farmers, upon seeing the fist-sized cotton bolls and the ox-horn-sized corn on the farms, were very envious. The surrounding farmers also flocked to the farms to visit and actively requested to learn production techniques. This year, the more than 3.4 million jin of improved winter wheat seeds propagated by the farms throughout the province have been very popular among the masses and have now been fully promoted to the farmers.

    山东国营农场麦秋两季丰收
    山东一百三十八处国营农场，今年麦秋两季都获丰收。共可生产粮食一千一百多万斤，平均每亩产量二百七十斤，超过去年单位产量百分之二点五。棉花增产更为显著，共可生产皮棉三十九万多斤，每亩平均六十六斤多，比今年全省棉花平均产量高一倍。
    近两年来，山东国营农场连续丰收，逐步改变了已往的亏本现象。去年全省农场即为国家积累财富二十四万多元，估计今年盈余将比去年增加六万多元。
    农场的丰收，对周围的农民起了示范作用。今年夏天，山东部分地区干旱，由于农场及时地进行浇水加强管理，所以秋季作物仍生长茁壮。有些农民看到农场馒头大的棉花桃，牛角大的玉米时，都很羡慕。周围的农民也都纷纷跑到农场里去参观，主动要求学习生产技术。今年全省农场繁殖的三百四十多万斤冬小麦良种，很受群众欢迎，目前已全部推广给农民。（周稼民）
