    Rapidly Constructing the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway
    By Our Correspondent Kang Weizhong

    The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway connects with the Longhai Railway, becoming a major artery spanning China from east to west. It extends westward from Lanzhou, passes through the Hexi Corridor, a famous transportation route since ancient times, and goes through Jiuquan, Yumen, Hami, and finally reaches Urumqi. From Urumqi, it goes west, passing through the Manas reclamation area north of the Tianshan Mountains, the Usu oil region, and the Yili Prefecture, before reaching the national border. From Lanzhou to the western border, the total length is more than 2,800 kilometers. Continuing west from here, one reaches Almaty, the capital of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, where it connects with the railway to Moscow. Traveling from Beijing to Moscow via the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway shortens the journey by 2,000 kilometers compared to going through Northeast China and bypassing Siberia.

    The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway line is rich in resources. Lanzhou is one of the important industrial construction cities in Northwest China, with abundant copper, manganese, coal, gypsum, pyrite, and hydropower resources nearby. Moving west, it passes through Yongdeng, rich in coal, gypsum, and metal mineral deposits; the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, where animal husbandry is developed; the Hexi Corridor, with convenient irrigation and great agricultural potential; Jiuquan, rich in power resources such as oil and coal; and the Anxi Basin and Yumen Oilfield area. After crossing Xingxing Gorge, it passes through the famous melon-producing area of Hami, the Turpan Basin, which is rich in seedless grapes, the agriculturally and pastorally developed northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains, and the fertile Yili River Valley. The construction of this railway will play an important role in the development of these areas.

    The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway broke ground in 1952 when the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway was opened to traffic on National Day. The thousands of workers participating in the construction, under the call of Chairman Mao, "Congratulations on the opening of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, and continue to work hard to build the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway," overcame various difficulties with a spirit of heroism. Heading west from Lanzhou, they had to cross the natural barrier of the Yellow River. Between Yongdeng and Gulang, they had to traverse the Wushaoling Mountains, which are 3,000 meters above sea level. In the areas of Wuwei, Zhangye, Jiuquan, and Anxi, they encountered grassland, Gobi Desert, alkaline land, and areas prone to soil heaving. Going west from Anxi, through Xingxing Gorge all the way to Hami, is mostly gravel area. The advance team for the construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway—the members of the Northwest Design Branch's Survey and Design Team—in order to select an ideal route, braved severe cold and scorching heat, climbed over Wushaoling, entered the grassland three times, entered the Gobi four times, and often ventured into uninhabited areas. The members of the First Survey Team, responsible for the preliminary survey of the Yumen-Hami line, starting in March of this year, trekked across this 600-kilometer-long area full of wasteland, Gobi Desert, knife-edged steep mountains, and waterless areas rarely visited by humans. The surveying team responsible for the key area of Xingxing Gorge, without a main road into Xingxing Gorge, opened up their own roads and often fought against level 5, 6, and 9 gales. Comrades responsible for the guide wire back points and terrain measurement were often blown down by the wind. The instrument operators faced the wind to look at the theodolite. When setting up the instrument on high mountains, there was always the danger of being blown down by the wind, so the instrument operators used their bodies to block the wind and held the instrument legs with both hands to make the work proceed quickly. Finally, in a short period of one and a half months, they selected eight comparison schemes and completed 1,600 kilometers of preliminary route survey, exceeding the plan by about 300 kilometers.

    Wushaoling lies across the eastern part of the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province. It is a level 5 to 8 seismic zone with complex terrain and geology, and the route is extremely winding. On more than 50 kilometers of continuous mountains, the railway has to pass through seven tunnels with a total length of 2.5 kilometers, cross fifteen large, medium, and small bridges, and sixty-two culverts. The mountains are high and the weather is cold, it snows all year round, the air is thin, the population is sparse, and the material conditions are poor, which brings great difficulties to the construction. However, more than 30,000 workers participating in the construction bravely and stubbornly overcame various difficulties and broke through this barrier. For example, during the excavation of the pilot tunnel in the large tunnel, as much as 178 tons of water flowed out of the tunnel in one day. Everyone came up with ways to drain the water with bamboo tubes and built steel plate sheds in the tunnel to continue working. The geology in the tunnel was complex, and excavation was difficult, so the workers used pneumatic drills to drill holes and blast, increasing efficiency by three to five times. Tunnel workers Wang Kai, Liu Zhi, Tan Xi, and others always walked in the forefront of the construction team when the pilot tunnel was bottoming out. They were knocked down by the smoke from the blasts and were carried out of the tunnel, but they went back in after they regained consciousness.

    After the railway passes through Wushaoling, it reaches the treacherous Gulang Gorge. Here, a steep cliff more than 180 meters high blocks the railway's westward progress. The stone of the cliff has weathered, and when an earthquake occurs, rocks fall to the ground, seriously hindering the safe operation of trains. In order to eliminate future troubles permanently, the First Engineering Bureau adopted the Soviet large-scale blasting method to completely blast away the part of the falling cliff that hindered traffic safety. When the borehole pilot tunnel was more than 20 meters deep, the air in the tunnel gradually became thin due to the curvature and narrowness of the tunnel, coupled with the lime powder splashed up by the pneumatic drills, which made it difficult for the workers in the tunnel to breathe. Communist Youth League member Liu Jinghua used a pulley to pull the ventilation pipe into the pilot tunnel, shortening the smoke exhaust time in the pilot tunnel; worker Wang Fucheng proposed to wrap the pneumatic drill rod with wet burlap to avoid splashing of lime powder. After thirty-six days and nights of construction, the borehole of the 46-meter-long "heart" of the falling cliff was completed. At 8:30 p.m. on September 5, most of the half-cliff head of the falling cliff was blasted away. A total of more than 38,000 cubic meters of rock were blasted away in this blast, saving the state more than 100,000 yuan in project costs.

    After the railway crosses Wuwei and Hexibao in the Hexi Corridor, it meanders through vast grasslands, alkaline lands, Gobi Deserts, and many sand dunes and areas prone to soil heaving, making the project even more complex and difficult. On the construction sites of the grasslands and alkaline lands, clumps of camel grass and Stipagrostis pennata grow. People here regard "sand" as "gold," "stone" as "silver," and water as "gasoline," which shows how scarce these things are here. The workers of the Thirteenth Work Area, who were constructing on the alkaline land, relied on the assistance of the local Mongolian people to find several Baiquan springs more than seven or eight kilometers away from the alkaline land, and found better-quality stones and sand in the remote small mountain gullies. In order to solve the difficulties of bridge and culvert construction, the First Engineering Bureau also established several pier and bridge factories on this line. The establishment of these factories basically solved the difficulties of water and sand shortage in the Gobi Desert and grassland areas, overcame the difficulties of winter construction, and accelerated the progress of the project.

    Now, the rail-laying project of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has crossed the grassland and will soon reach Zhangye, 538 kilometers away from Lanzhou. The original plan for this railway this year was to lay rails to Zhangye, which is about 300 kilometers away from Yumen. Several hundred kilometers of oil produced by the Yumen Oilfield still relies on road transport to the east. In order to meet the needs of expanding production in the Yumen Oilfield, this railway is planned to lay rails another 100 kilometers westward from Zhangye this year. At the same time, the aerial survey of the 1,900-kilometer line from Yumen to the Sino-Soviet border of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has recently been completed, which will greatly accelerate the construction of this railway.

    Every progress of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is inseparable from the strong support of the people of the whole country, especially the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest. Anshan Iron and Steel, Shenyang Bridge Factory and other factories in Northeast China manufactured a large number of rails and steel beams for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, and also manufactured large and small construction machinery. North China, Central South China, Northeast China and other places transported a large amount of cement, wood and various steel materials, and mobilized thousands of workers and technicians to carry out construction. The people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest know the close relationship between this railway and their economic life and cultural life, and therefore gave more strong support. In terms of food, housing, material transportation, and labor force replenishment, they gave their full assistance. The Tibetan people of Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County voluntarily vacated their houses for the workers participating in the Wushaoling construction project who had no houses to live in. Farmers along the route prepared a large number of meat foods such as cattle, sheep, and pigs for the construction workers, and brought gifts such as eggs to comfort the workers.

    Soviet experts have also made great contributions to the construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. They helped select the most ideal route and solve the design problems of each key project. They climbed mountains and waded through rivers, regardless of hardship, and traveled to every work area on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang line. They inspected every construction site and studied and reviewed documents. Because the suggestions put forward by the experts were both economical and reasonable, the state saved a lot of funds. For example, when the Northwest Design Branch was surveying and designing the bridge sites of the Heihe River and the Xinhe River on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Road, the original plan was to divert the water of the Xinhe River to the Heihe River and erect a large bridge on the Heihe River, with a project cost of 3 million yuan. Soviet experts suggested that two bridges should be built separately according to the original terrain of the Xinhe River and the Heihe River, and the project cost would only be about 2 million yuan. The first detachment of the fifth survey team and the second geological team of the Northwest Design Branch earnestly implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts in the fixed survey comparison plan from Jiayuguan to Yumen Oilfield, reducing the number of culvert projects by 30 and shortening the line by 350 meters, saving the state 1.2 million yuan.

    迅速建设中的兰新铁路
    本报记者　康伟中
    兰新铁路同陇海铁路相接，成为横贯我国东西的大动脉。它由兰州向西，穿过自古以来著名的交通孔道河西走廊，经酒泉、玉门、哈密，直到乌鲁木齐。从乌鲁木齐向西，穿过天山北麓玛纳斯开垦区、乌苏石油区和伊犁专区，便到了国境。从兰州到西部国境，共长二千八百多公里。从这里再往西去，便到了苏联哈萨克共和国的首都阿拉木图，在那里就可以同去莫斯科的铁路接上了。从北京到莫斯科，经兰新铁路比经过东北绕道西伯利亚要缩短两千公里。
    兰新铁路沿线的物产是很丰富的。兰州是我国西北工业建设的重要城市之一，附近有丰富的铜、锰、煤、石膏、硫化铁及水力资源。往西要经过煤、石膏、金属矿藏都很丰富的永登，牧畜业发达的天祝藏族自治区，灌溉便利、农业潜在力极大的河西走廊，石油、煤等动力资源丰富的酒泉以及安西盆地和玉门油矿区。穿过星星峡，又经过著名的产瓜区哈密，盛产无核葡萄的吐鲁番盆地，农牧业发达的天山北麓和丰饶的伊犁河谷。这条铁路修建之后，对开发这些地区将有重要作用。
    兰新铁路是一九五二年国庆节天兰铁路开始通车时破土开工的。参加建设的成千上万的职工们，在毛主席的“庆贺天兰路通车，继续努力修筑兰新路”的号召下，以英勇不屈的精神来克服种种困难。从兰州往西，就要跨过黄河天险。在永登和古浪之间，要穿越拔海三千公尺的乌鞘岭。在武威、张掖、酒泉、安西一带，要遇上草滩、戈壁滩、碱滩和翻浆地。从安西再往西去，经星星峡一直到哈密，大都是沙砾区。建设兰新铁路的前哨部队——西北设计分局勘测设计总队的队员们，为了选择一条理想的路线，不避严寒和酷暑，爬过乌鞘岭，三进草滩，四进戈壁，经常出入没有人烟的地区。担任由玉门到哈密线路草测的第一勘查总队的队员们，从今年三月起，就跋涉在这六百公里长、到处是荒滩、戈壁、刀锋般陡峭的丛山峻岭，以及人迹罕到的无水地区。担任星星峡关键地区的勘测队员们，没有大道进星星峡，就自己开辟道路，经常跟五级、六级、九级大风作斗争。担任导线后点和地形跑尺的同志，经常被大风吹倒。司镜的同志迎风看经纬仪。在高山上支镜，时时有被大风吹倒的危险，支镜的同志就用身体挡风，用双手扶住镜腿，使工作迅速进行，终于在短短一个半月的时间内选出八个比较方案，完成了一千六百公里的线路草测任务，超过计划三百公里左右。
    乌鞘岭横亘在甘肃省河西走廊的东部，是五级到八级的地震区，地形和地质都很复杂，线路极其迂回曲折。在连绵五十多公里的山岭上，铁路要穿过总长二点五公里的七个隧道，跨过十五座大、中、小桥和六十二个涵洞。山高天寒，四季都下雪，空气稀薄，人烟稀少，物质条件又不好，这给施工带来了极大困难。但是，参加施工的三万多工人英勇顽强地克服了种种困难，打通了这一关。如在大隧道导坑开挖的时候，洞内一天竟出一百七十八吨水，大家想办法用竹筒排水，在洞内搭钢板棚，以便继续工作。洞内地质复杂，开挖困难，工人们就利用风钻打眼开炮，提高效率三倍至五倍。隧道工王凯、刘芝、谭希等在导坑落底时，一直走在施工队伍的前列，被炮烟熏倒了，被从洞里抬出来，清醒以后又进去了。
    铁路穿过乌鞘岭，就到艰险的古浪峡。在这里，一座高达一百八十多公尺的陡崖绝壁的跌落崖阻挡铁路西去。崖的石质已风化，遇上地震，崖上乱石就跌落地面，严重妨碍火车的安全运行。为了永除后患，第一工程局采用了苏联大爆破开山法，把跌落崖有碍行车安全的部分完全炸掉。当炮眼导坑深到二十多公尺以后，因坑弯曲狭小，洞内空气渐渐稀薄，再加上打风钻溅起来的石灰粉，致使在坑内的工人呼吸困难起来。青年团员刘景华用滑车往导坑内拉风管，缩短了导坑内的排烟时间；工人王福成提出用湿麻袋片裹住风钻杆工作，避免了石灰粉的飞溅。经过三十六昼夜的施工，一条长达四十六公尺的跌落崖“心脏”的炮眼挖成了。九月五日下午八时半，跌落崖半面崖头已大部被炸掉。这一炮炸掉的石头共有三万八千多立方公尺，为国家节约工程费用十万多元。
  铁路跨过河西走廊的武威、河西堡后，就蜿蜒在辽阔的草滩、碱滩、戈壁滩及许多沙丘、翻浆地带，工程越发复杂和困难。在草滩和碱滩的工地上，长满了一丛一丛的骆驼草和笈笈草。这里的人们把“砂”看成“金”，把“石头”看成“银”，把水看成“汽油”，可见这些东西在这里是很缺乏的。在碱滩工地施工的第十三工区的工人们，依靠当地蒙族人民的协助，在离碱滩七、八公里以外的地方找到了好几处白水泉，在遥远的小山沟中找到了质量较好的石头和砂子。为了解决桥涵施工的困难，第一工程局还在这条线上建立了好几座墩台成品和桥梁工厂。这些工厂的建立，基本上解决了在戈壁滩、草滩地带缺水缺砂的困难，并克服了冬季施工的困难，加速了工程的进度。
    现在，兰新铁路辅轨工程已越过了草滩，最近就要到达离兰州五百三十八公里的张掖了。这条铁路今年原来计划铺轨到张掖，张掖距离玉门约有三百公里。玉门油矿出产的石油，目前仍有几百公里依靠汽车东运。为了适应玉门油矿扩大生产的需要，这条铁路今年准备从张掖再向西铺轨一百多公里。同时，最近兰新铁路从玉门到中苏边境一千九百多公里线路的航空测量已经完成，将大大加速这条铁路的建设。
    兰新铁路的每一进展，都是同全国人民、特别是西北各族人民的大力支援分不开的。东北的鞍钢、沈阳桥梁厂等工厂为兰新铁路制造了大批铁轨和钢梁，还制造了大小型的施工机械。华北、中南、东北等地运来了大量水泥、木料和各种钢材，动员了成千上万的职工和技术人员来施工。西北各族人民知道这条铁路同他们的经济生活文化生活的密切关系，因而更加大力支援，在吃饭、住房、材料运输、劳动力补充等方面，他们都给以全力帮助。参加乌鞘岭修建工程的职工没有房子住，天祝藏族自治县藏族人民就自动腾出房子。沿线农民给筑路工人准备了大批牛、羊、猪等肉食，并带着鸡蛋等礼物慰问工人们。
    苏联专家在兰新铁路的建设中也作了巨大的贡献。他们帮助选择最理想的线路，解决每项关键性工程的设计问题。他们爬山涉水，不避艰苦，走遍了兰新线上每一个工区。他们视察每一段施工现场，研究审查文件。由于专家提出的建议既经济又合理，使国家节约了大量资金。如西北设计分局在勘查设计兰新路黑河和新河的桥位的时候，原计划把新河的水引向黑河，在黑河上架一大桥，工程造价达三百万元。苏联专家建议仍按新河和黑河原来地形，分别架设二座桥梁，其工程造价只有二百万元左右。西北设计分局第五勘测纵队选线一分队和地质二分队在担任嘉峪关至玉门油矿定测比较方案中，认真贯彻实行了苏联专家建议，减少了涵管工程三十处，缩短线路三百五十公尺，为国家节约了一百二十万元。（附图片）
