The events that have recently occurred in North Africa indicate that the French ruling clique is still unwilling to give up its colonial rule in Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria, in an attempt to maintain the main source of maximum profits for French monopoly capital. Some bourgeois politicians and newspapers in France often clamor for the protection of France's "interests" in North Africa. Are they referring to France's true national interests, or the dirty profits of a few monopoly groups? A correct conclusion can be easily reached by slightly studying the economic situation in North Africa.

Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria are located in the northern part of the African continent, and their combined area is five times that of France itself. There are abundant mineral, forest, and agricultural resources here. Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria produce nearly half of the capitalist world's phosphates, iron, zinc, and lead; the reserves of other non-ferrous metals are also very rich. Morocco is one of the main sources of manganese for the capitalist world market and an important producer of cobalt in the world. Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria also produce a wide variety of agricultural raw materials such as flax, cork, grapes, and olives. Therefore, they are naturally a piece of fat meat in the eyes of the colonialists. From the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth century, French colonialists successively conquered Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, and have been carrying out insatiable plunder there for a long time, taking this large colonial area as their source of raw materials, sales market, investment place, and cheap labor. North Africa has gradually become the private property of the largest French monopoly consortia.

In North Africa, the colonialists seized large areas of fertile land through various despicable means, and then used them to cruelly exploit the local residents. In Algeria, 13,000 colonialists occupied 55 percent of the arable land, leaving 700,000 Algerian farmers with no land to cultivate. In Morocco, 7 million Moroccan farmers have only 4 million hectares of land, while 4,000 to 5,000 colonialists occupy 1 million hectares. In Tunisia, one-fifth of the most fertile land is occupied by 4,000 colonialists. For example, the "Algerian Company" alone occupies 70,000 hectares in Algeria, and the French African Company occupies 60,000 hectares in Tunisia. On these lands, French monopoly capital operates large-scale plantations, cultivating a large number of profitable industrial raw materials and exporting them abroad for profit. Not only that, they also forced local residents to abandon traditional grain production and animal husbandry, and switch to growing export cash crops, which they purchased at low prices. In this way, French monopoly capital made the agriculture of these colonies completely subservient to their interests, and made a great fortune from it.

The colonialists also seized the underground resources of North Africa as their own. The mining rights of various minerals in Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco are in the hands of French monopoly capital. The Schneider, Ugine-Kuhlmann, and other French large trusts control 75 percent of the iron mined in Algeria, 84 percent of the iron mined in Tunisia, and 95 percent of the iron mined in Morocco. The phosphates mined in Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco are all monopolized by French companies such as Gafsa Company, Tunisian Phosphate Company, Constantine Phosphate Company, and Cherifian Phosphate Company. The mining of lead, manganese, cobalt, etc. is also controlled by French large trusts. The concession contract obtained by the "Ouenza Company," which currently produces 76 percent of Algeria's iron ore, shows how French monopoly capital plunders the resources of the North African colonies. The concession contract of this company stipulates: "Algeria grants the 'Ouenza' Company the exclusive mining rights for all iron ore and other minerals on the public land in the Ouenza region until it is exhausted." This clearly shows that French monopoly capital is trying to extract all the resources of North Africa.

France's "development" of North Africa will certainly not bring any benefits to the people of North Africa. French monopoly capital has tried its best to hinder the true industrialization of the North African colonies. Whether in Algeria, Tunisia, or Morocco, there is almost no basic industry. All some processing industries, such as Algeria's chemical fertilizer and food industry, Tunisia's cement industry, and Morocco's paper-making and canned food industry, are mainly producing for export, while industries such as sugar-making and tobacco-making are also for exploiting the local people. Moreover, all these industries are mostly owned by French capital, and many are even subsidiaries of French companies. According to the incomplete statistics of the French "Financial Manual" in 1951, among the companies in Morocco with a capital of more than 100 million francs, 93 percent of the capital belonged to French people in France and Morocco.

French monopoly capital also monopolizes the foreign trade of these colonies. For example, more than 70 percent of Algeria's trade is conducted with France, making it France's primary customer and third largest supplier. France accounts for about 60 percent of Morocco's total imports. Three-quarters of Tunisia's market is controlled by French capitalists. On the one hand, French monopoly capital transports a large amount of mineral and agricultural raw materials (and some processed products such as wine) from North Africa at low prices, and on the other hand, it imports industrial finished products at high prices, using it as a market for dumping goods. In this unequal trade, French monopoly capital makes profits on both sides, while the people of North Africa suffer double exploitation.

The entire economic lifeline of Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco is thus completely controlled by a few French monopoly consortia such as the Mirabaud-Mare Bank Group, the Paribas Bank Group, and the Rothschild Bank Group. For example, the Mirabaud-Mare Bank Group almost dominates the economy of Algeria through the "Algerian Company" and its affiliated companies. It also maintains a dominant position in the economy of Tunisia through enterprises such as the Gafsa Phosphate Company; and it cooperates with other financial groups to participate in the mining of non-ferrous metals in Morocco. Paribas Bank, through the North African "Omnium" company, controls the economy of Morocco, and participates in the operation of some enterprises in Algeria through its connections with other enterprises. The Rothschild Bank Group controls the production of non-ferrous metals in Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco through the Pe√±arroya Company, and jointly controls the Moroccan railway network with Paribas Bank and other groups. These monopoly consortia are the true "masters" of North Africa.

The control of North Africa by French monopoly capital has enabled them to obtain huge profits that increase year by year. The profits of the 14 major French companies in Algeria increased from 413 million francs in 1947 to 2.7522 billion francs in 1951. During the same period, the profits of the 14 major companies in Morocco increased from 388 million francs to 2.425 billion francs; the profits of the 10 major companies in Tunisia increased from 501 million francs to 2.246 billion francs. For example, the profits of the Aoul Mining Office (Rothschild Bank Group) in Morocco increased more than 11 times during this period. All of this is the "interest" that French imperialists are reluctant to give up.

It cannot be ignored that since the war, American forces have intensified their infiltration into North Africa. American capital has entered various economic sectors in North Africa and participated in the development of natural resources. The United States has also continuously expanded its military bases in North Africa, thereby greatly strengthening its position in North Africa. At the same time, the West German monopoly capital, which has gradually recovered its vitality, has also intensified its expansion activities in North Africa. This has affected the exclusive position of the French colonial group. However, French monopoly capital clearly believes that the greatest threat to their "interests" is the increasingly strong desire of the North African people for national independence. Therefore, the French authorities are desperately trying to suppress the national liberation movements of the people of Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria, and are attempting to use American "aid" to achieve this goal.

It is very clear that what the French authorities want to maintain is only the dirty colonial interests of French monopoly capital, not the national interests of the French people. In fact, the violent policies implemented by France in North Africa have caused serious disasters to the French people. In order to suppress the national movement in North Africa, the French authorities have transferred 300,000 to 400,000 troops to North Africa, and have incurred huge casualties. France's military expenditure in North Africa has tripled compared to two years ago, costing 800 million francs per day. Because the French authorities want to continue to strengthen their military suppression forces in North Africa, 75,000 retired personnel have been re-enlisted, and 100,000 personnel who could have retired must extend their service, which means that nearly 200,000 families will be affected. All of this is completely inconsistent with the interests of the French people. The French people absolutely disagree with the French government's practice of refusing to recognize the legitimate aspirations of the North African people in order to protect the "interests" of the French monopoly group, and especially oppose the military suppression measures taken by the French authorities against the North African people. They know that only by recognizing the independent rights of the people of Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria can France's interests be truly met. They know that the problems of Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria should and can be resolved on the basis that both meet the interests of the people of the North African colonies and the interests of France.
