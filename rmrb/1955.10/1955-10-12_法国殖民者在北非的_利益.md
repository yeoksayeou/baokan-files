The events that have recently occurred in North Africa indicate that the French ruling clique is still unwilling to give up its colonial rule in Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria, in an attempt to maintain the main source of maximum profits for French monopoly capital. Some bourgeois politicians and newspapers in France often clamor for the protection of France's "interests" in North Africa. Are they referring to France's true national interests, or the dirty profits of a few monopoly groups? A correct conclusion can be easily reached by slightly studying the economic situation in North Africa.

Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria are located in the northern part of the African continent, and their combined area is five times that of France itself. There are abundant mineral, forest, and agricultural resources here. Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria produce nearly half of the capitalist world's phosphates, iron, zinc, and lead; the reserves of other non-ferrous metals are also very rich. Morocco is one of the main sources of manganese for the capitalist world market and an important producer of cobalt in the world. Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria also produce a wide variety of agricultural raw materials such as flax, cork, grapes, and olives. Therefore, they are naturally a piece of fat meat in the eyes of the colonialists. From the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth century, French colonialists successively conquered Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, and have been carrying out insatiable plunder there for a long time, taking this large colonial area as their source of raw materials, sales market, investment place, and cheap labor. North Africa has gradually become the private property of the largest French monopoly consortia.

In North Africa, the colonialists seized large areas of fertile land through various despicable means, and then used them to cruelly exploit the local residents. In Algeria, 13,000 colonialists occupied 55 percent of the arable land, leaving 700,000 Algerian farmers with no land to cultivate. In Morocco, 7 million Moroccan farmers have only 4 million hectares of land, while 4,000 to 5,000 colonialists occupy 1 million hectares. In Tunisia, one-fifth of the most fertile land is occupied by 4,000 colonialists. For example, the "Algerian Company" alone occupies 70,000 hectares in Algeria, and the French African Company occupies 60,000 hectares in Tunisia. On these lands, French monopoly capital operates large-scale plantations, cultivating a large number of profitable industrial raw materials and exporting them abroad for profit. Not only that, they also forced local residents to abandon traditional grain production and animal husbandry, and switch to growing export cash crops, which they purchased at low prices. In this way, French monopoly capital made the agriculture of these colonies completely subservient to their interests, and made a great fortune from it.

The colonialists also seized the underground resources of North Africa as their own. The mining rights of various minerals in Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco are in the hands of French monopoly capital. The Schneider, Ugine-Kuhlmann, and other French large trusts control 75 percent of the iron mined in Algeria, 84 percent of the iron mined in Tunisia, and 95 percent of the iron mined in Morocco. The phosphates mined in Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco are all monopolized by French companies such as Gafsa Company, Tunisian Phosphate Company, Constantine Phosphate Company, and Cherifian Phosphate Company. The mining of lead, manganese, cobalt, etc. is also controlled by French large trusts. The concession contract obtained by the "Ouenza Company," which currently produces 76 percent of Algeria's iron ore, shows how French monopoly capital plunders the resources of the North African colonies. The concession contract of this company stipulates: "Algeria grants the 'Ouenza' Company the exclusive mining rights for all iron ore and other minerals on the public land in the Ouenza region until it is exhausted." This clearly shows that French monopoly capital is trying to extract all the resources of North Africa.

France's "development" of North Africa will certainly not bring any benefits to the people of North Africa. French monopoly capital has tried its best to hinder the true industrialization of the North African colonies. Whether in Algeria, Tunisia, or Morocco, there is almost no basic industry. All some processing industries, such as Algeria's chemical fertilizer and food industry, Tunisia's cement industry, and Morocco's paper-making and canned food industry, are mainly producing for export, while industries such as sugar-making and tobacco-making are also for exploiting the local people. Moreover, all these industries are mostly owned by French capital, and many are even subsidiaries of French companies. According to the incomplete statistics of the French "Financial Manual" in 1951, among the companies in Morocco with a capital of more than 100 million francs, 93 percent of the capital belonged to French people in France and Morocco.

French monopoly capital also monopolizes the foreign trade of these colonies. For example, more than 70 percent of Algeria's trade is conducted with France, making it France's primary customer and third largest supplier. France accounts for about 60 percent of Morocco's total imports. Three-quarters of Tunisia's market is controlled by French capitalists. On the one hand, French monopoly capital transports a large amount of mineral and agricultural raw materials (and some processed products such as wine) from North Africa at low prices, and on the other hand, it imports industrial finished products at high prices, using it as a market for dumping goods. In this unequal trade, French monopoly capital makes profits on both sides, while the people of North Africa suffer double exploitation.

The entire economic lifeline of Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco is thus completely controlled by a few French monopoly consortia such as the Mirabaud-Mare Bank Group, the Paribas Bank Group, and the Rothschild Bank Group. For example, the Mirabaud-Mare Bank Group almost dominates the economy of Algeria through the "Algerian Company" and its affiliated companies. It also maintains a dominant position in the economy of Tunisia through enterprises such as the Gafsa Phosphate Company; and it cooperates with other financial groups to participate in the mining of non-ferrous metals in Morocco. Paribas Bank, through the North African "Omnium" company, controls the economy of Morocco, and participates in the operation of some enterprises in Algeria through its connections with other enterprises. The Rothschild Bank Group controls the production of non-ferrous metals in Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco through the Peñarroya Company, and jointly controls the Moroccan railway network with Paribas Bank and other groups. These monopoly consortia are the true "masters" of North Africa.

The control of North Africa by French monopoly capital has enabled them to obtain huge profits that increase year by year. The profits of the 14 major French companies in Algeria increased from 413 million francs in 1947 to 2.7522 billion francs in 1951. During the same period, the profits of the 14 major companies in Morocco increased from 388 million francs to 2.425 billion francs; the profits of the 10 major companies in Tunisia increased from 501 million francs to 2.246 billion francs. For example, the profits of the Aoul Mining Office (Rothschild Bank Group) in Morocco increased more than 11 times during this period. All of this is the "interest" that French imperialists are reluctant to give up.

It cannot be ignored that since the war, American forces have intensified their infiltration into North Africa. American capital has entered various economic sectors in North Africa and participated in the development of natural resources. The United States has also continuously expanded its military bases in North Africa, thereby greatly strengthening its position in North Africa. At the same time, the West German monopoly capital, which has gradually recovered its vitality, has also intensified its expansion activities in North Africa. This has affected the exclusive position of the French colonial group. However, French monopoly capital clearly believes that the greatest threat to their "interests" is the increasingly strong desire of the North African people for national independence. Therefore, the French authorities are desperately trying to suppress the national liberation movements of the people of Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria, and are attempting to use American "aid" to achieve this goal.

It is very clear that what the French authorities want to maintain is only the dirty colonial interests of French monopoly capital, not the national interests of the French people. In fact, the violent policies implemented by France in North Africa have caused serious disasters to the French people. In order to suppress the national movement in North Africa, the French authorities have transferred 300,000 to 400,000 troops to North Africa, and have incurred huge casualties. France's military expenditure in North Africa has tripled compared to two years ago, costing 800 million francs per day. Because the French authorities want to continue to strengthen their military suppression forces in North Africa, 75,000 retired personnel have been re-enlisted, and 100,000 personnel who could have retired must extend their service, which means that nearly 200,000 families will be affected. All of this is completely inconsistent with the interests of the French people. The French people absolutely disagree with the French government's practice of refusing to recognize the legitimate aspirations of the North African people in order to protect the "interests" of the French monopoly group, and especially oppose the military suppression measures taken by the French authorities against the North African people. They know that only by recognizing the independent rights of the people of Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria can France's interests be truly met. They know that the problems of Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria should and can be resolved on the basis that both meet the interests of the people of the North African colonies and the interests of France.

    法国殖民者在北非的“利益”
    谭文瑞
    最近在北非发生的事情表明，法国统治集团还不愿放弃它在摩洛哥、突尼斯和阿尔及利亚的殖民统治，以图保持法国垄断资本攫取最大限度利润的主要源泉。法国的一些资产阶级政客和报刊经常嚷叫要维护法国在北非的“利益”，他们所指的究竟是法国的真正的民族利益呢，还是少数几个垄断集团的肮脏的利润？只要略为研究一下北非的经济情况，就不难获得正确的结论。
    摩洛哥、突尼斯和阿尔及利亚位于非洲大陆的北部，面积合起来相当于法国本土的五倍。这里有着丰富的矿物、森林和农业资源。摩洛哥、突尼斯和阿尔及利亚生产着资本主义世界将近一半的磷酸盐、铁、锌、铅；其他有色金属的蕴藏也很丰富。摩洛哥就是资本主义世界市场主要的锰的供应地之一，同时是世界一个重要的钴的出产地。摩洛哥、突尼斯和阿尔及利亚并且出产亚麻、软木、葡萄、橄榄等种类繁多的农业原料。因此，它们在殖民者的眼中自然是一块肥肉。法国殖民者从十九世纪中叶到二十世纪初先后征服了阿尔及利亚、突尼斯和摩洛哥，长期以来就在那里进行贪得无餍的掠夺，把这一大片殖民地作为他们的原料产地、销售市场、投资场所和廉价劳动力的来源。北非就逐步成了法国最大几个垄断财团的禁脔。
    在北非，殖民者们通过各种各样卑劣的手段夺取了大片肥沃的土地，然后利用它们向当地居民进行残酷的剥削。在阿尔及利亚，一万三千个殖民者就占有了百分之五十五的耕地，而使七十万户阿尔及利亚农民无地可耕。在摩洛哥，七百万摩洛哥农民才只有四百万公顷土地，而四、五千个殖民者就占有一百万公顷。在突尼斯，也是五分之一的最肥沃的土地为四千个殖民者所霸占。像“阿尔及利亚公司”一家就在阿尔及利亚占地七万公顷，法兰西非洲公司在突尼斯占地六万公顷。在这些土地上，法国垄断资本经营着大规模的庄园，大量种植有利可图的工业原料，输出国外赢利。不仅如此，他们还强迫当地居民废弃传统的谷物生产和畜牧，改种出口商品作物，由他们廉价收购。法国垄断资本就是这样使这些殖民地的农业完全屈从于他们的利益，而从中大发其财。
    殖民者同样也把北非的地下资源攫为己有。阿尔及利亚、突尼斯和摩洛哥各种矿产的开采权都操在法国垄断资本的手中。许奈特、犹齐诺和其他一些法国大托拉斯控制了在阿尔及利亚开采的百分之七十五，在突尼斯开采的百分之八十四和在摩洛哥开采的百分之九十五的铁。在阿尔及利亚、突尼斯和摩洛哥所开采的磷酸盐、全部由加夫萨公司，突尼斯磷酸盐公司、君士坦丁磷酸盐公司、薛利芬磷酸盐公司等法国企业所垄断。铅、锰、钴等的开采，亦为法国的大托拉斯所掌握。只要从目前生产着阿尔及利亚铁矿砂的百分之七十六的“乌翁沙公司”所获得的租让合同，就可以看出法国垄断资本是怎样掠夺着北非殖民地的资源。这家公司的租让合同中规定：“阿尔及利亚把乌翁沙区公有土地上所有铁矿和其他矿产的独家开采权给予‘乌翁沙’公司，直到竭尽为止。”这很清楚地说明，法国垄断资本妄图把北非的资源搜干括尽。
    法国对北非的“开发”，当然不会给北非人民带来什么好处。法国垄断资本亟力阻挠北非殖民地的真正工业化。不论在阿尔及利亚、突尼斯或摩洛哥，都几乎没有基础工业。所有的一些加工工业，如阿尔及利亚的化学肥料和食品工业，突尼斯的水泥工业以及摩洛哥的造纸、罐头食品工业等主要都是为了输出而生产，而制糖、制烟等工业则同时也为了剥削当地人民。而且所有这些工业也绝大部分是属于法国资本，许多甚至就是法国企业的子公司。根据法国“金融手册”一九五一年的不完全统计，在摩洛哥的资本一亿法郎以上的公司中，百分之九十三的资本是属于在法国和摩洛哥的法国人。
    法国垄断资本并且垄断了这些殖民地的对外贸易。像阿尔及利亚，百分之七十以上的贸易是同法国进行的，它成了法国对外贸易的第一位主顾和第三位供应者。法国在摩洛哥输入总额中所占的份额约达百分之六十左右。突尼斯的四分之三的市场控制在法国资本家的手里。法国垄断资本一方面从北非以低价运走大量的矿业和农业原料（也有一部分像葡萄酒一类的加工品），另一方面则以高价输入工业制成品，把它作为倾销商品的市场。在这种不等价的贸易中，法国垄断资本两面牟利，而北非人民则遭受了双重剥削。
    阿尔及利亚、突尼斯和摩洛哥的全部经济命脉就是这样完全操纵在米拉波—马雷银行集团、巴黎荷兰银行集团和洛希尔银行集团等几个法国垄断财团的手里。例如米拉波—马雷银行集团通过“阿尔及利亚公司”和其附属公司，几乎主宰了阿尔及利亚的经济。它并且通过加夫萨磷酸盐公司等企业，在突尼斯的经济中保有优越的地位；而又同其他金融集团进行合作，参预摩洛哥的有色金属的开采。巴黎荷兰银行通过北非“奥姆尼”公司，支配着摩洛哥的经济，并靠了和别的一些企业的联系，参预了阿尔及利亚一部分企业的经营。洛希尔银行集团则通过庞纳罗雅公司操纵了阿尔及利亚、突尼斯和摩洛哥的有色金属的生产，并和巴黎荷兰银行等集团共同控制了摩洛哥铁路网。这些垄断财团就是北非的真正的“主人”。
    法国垄断资本对北非的控制，使他们获得了一年比一年增加的巨额利润。在阿尔及利亚的十四家主要的法国公司的利润，从一九四七年的四亿一千三百万法郎增加到一九五一年的二十七亿五千二百万法郎。在同一时期中，在摩洛哥的十四家主要公司的利润，从三亿八千八百万法郎增加到二十四亿二千五百万法郎；在突尼斯的十家主要公司的利润，从五亿零一百万法郎增加到二十二亿四千六百万法郎。像在摩洛哥的阿乌尔矿业处（洛希尔银行集团）在这个期间的利润，就增加了十一倍以上。所有这一切，都是法国帝国主义者所不忍释手的“利益”。
    人们不能不注意到，战后以来，美国势力已加紧渗入北非。美国资本打进了北非的各个经济部门，参加了对天然资源的开发。美国并且不断扩大它在北非的军事基地，从而大大加强美国在北非的地位。同时日渐恢复了元气的西德垄断资本也加紧向北非进行扩张活动。这都影响到法国殖民集团的独占地位。但是法国垄断资本显然认为对他们的“利益”的最大威胁，是北非人民要求民族独立的日益强烈的愿望。因此法国当局不顾一切地要把突尼斯、摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放运动镇压下去，并且企图借助美国的“援助”来达到这一目的。
    十分明显，法国当局所要维护的，只是法国垄断资本的肮脏的殖民利益，而不是法国人民的民族利益。事实上，由于法国在北非实行的暴力政策，已给法国人民造成严重的灾害。法国当局为了镇压北非的民族运动，已把三十万到四十万军队调到北非去，并招致了巨大的伤亡。法国在北非的军事费用已比两年前增加了三倍，每天耗费达八亿法郎。因为法国当局要继续加强在北非的军事镇压力量，七万五千名已退役的人员被重新征召入伍，十万原来可以退役的人员要延长服役，也就是说，将近二十万个家庭都要受到影响。这都是和法国人民的利益毫不相符的。法国人民绝不同意法国政府为了保护法国垄断集团的“利益”而拒绝承认北非人民的合法愿望的做法，特别反对法国当局对北非人民采取的军事镇压措施。他们知道，只有承认突尼斯、摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚人民的独立权利，才是真正符合法国的利益的。他们知道，突尼斯、摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚的问题，应当而且可以在既符合北非殖民地人民的利益也符合法国的利益的基础上求得解决。
