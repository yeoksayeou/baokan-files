    Fresh Egg Warehouse Built Using Soviet Experience
    Qiao Yuzhou
    Our country is an extremely rich producer of egg products, with an annual national egg production of over 16.4 billion. The total value of fresh egg and egg product exports often ranks third or fourth among our country's export goods. Due to the improvement of people's living standards, the number of people consuming fresh eggs domestically has also been increasing in recent years. In Beijing, for example, nearly 500,000 eggs are consumed every day. Therefore, ensuring that urban residents have fresh eggs to eat and guaranteeing a certain amount of fresh egg exports has become a very important task.
    Eggs are very delicate: they are susceptible to impact, cold, and heat. Too cold, and they will crack and the yolks will disperse; too hot, and they will spoil. Therefore, storing tens of thousands of fresh eggs well, ensuring that they do not spoil in the hottest or coldest weather, is very difficult. To store eggs well, the comrades of the China Food Company have devised many methods. For example, in the Northeast, they tried a method of preservation using limewater, which reduced spoilage and extended storage time; however, this method is only suitable for preserving a small quantity of eggs. Cold storage is undoubtedly the best way to preserve them, but it requires a lot of capital, which is currently difficult to obtain. Last year, the employees of the Beijing Municipal Company warehouse of the China Food Company installed heating in the warehouse, resulting in excessive heat near the heating elements and excessive coldness far from them; in particular, the problem of preserving eggs in the summer remained unresolved. In August of this year, when Beijing's weather was at its hottest, the Beijing Municipal Company lost over 44,000 jin of eggs due to spoilage. In 1954, the national losses in this regard totaled about one million yuan.
    In order to reduce losses from egg spoilage during storage, some places dare not freely purchase eggs during the peak season, or even stop purchasing them altogether, resulting in farmers being unable to sell their surplus eggs and experiencing reduced income; during the off-season, the cities do not have enough eggs to meet the needs of the people.
    In order to effectively preserve fresh eggs, the China Food Company has utilized advanced Soviet experience to build a simple cold air warehouse in Beijing. This type of warehouse is not much different from ordinary houses, except that two ventilators are installed on the roof to regulate humidity and exchange air inside the warehouse; the ceilings and walls are filled with rice husks to prevent heat or cold from the outside from penetrating; and during the summer, salt ice is placed inside to dissipate heat. The construction cost of this type of warehouse is only one-fifth of that of a mechanical refrigeration warehouse per square meter, and it is easy to manage. It can also be used to store fruits and medicines. Storing fresh eggs costs only three fen per kilogram per month, which is half the cost of mechanical refrigeration. If natural ice is used or a method is devised to recover the salt solution, the storage cost can be further reduced.
    Currently, the China Food Company has revised some of the shortcomings in the design of this warehouse and has decided to invest another 4.69 million yuan to build such warehouses in Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, Hebei, Henan, and other major egg-producing areas, as well as in major consumer cities such as Beijing and Tianjin. Once these warehouses are built, the large-scale spoilage of eggs will be avoidable. In these areas, it will be possible to appropriately purchase eggs during the peak season, store them locally, and then transport them to the cities during the off-season, thereby ensuring that urban residents can regularly eat fresh eggs.

    运用苏联经验修建的鲜蛋仓库
    乔雨舟
    我国是一个蛋品产量极为丰富的国家，每年全国生产的鸡蛋达一百六十四亿枚以上。鲜蛋和蛋品的输出总值，常常占我国出口物资的第三位或第四位。由于人民生活水平提高，近几年国内食用鲜蛋的人数也一天天多起来了。以北京来说，现在每天差不多消费五十万个。所以，为了保证城市居民有鲜蛋吃，保证有一定数量的鲜蛋出口，把鲜蛋保管好，就成了一项十分重要的工作。
    鸡蛋很娇气：怕碰、怕冷、怕热。太冷就会冻裂、散黄，太热就会变质。所以把数以万计的鲜蛋保管好，使它们在最热或最冷的时候都不变质，是很不容易的。为了保管好鸡蛋，中国食品公司的同志们想了许多办法。例如在东北，他们试用了一种用石灰水保管的方法，鸡蛋腐烂变质的减少了，存放的时间也延长了；可是这个方法只适宜于保存少量的鸡蛋。用冷藏库来保管是再好不过了，但要花费很多的资金，这在目前是有困难的。去年，中国食品公司北京市公司仓库的职工们在仓库内安装暖气，结果靠近暖气的地方太热，离暖气远的地方又太凉；特别是夏天保存鸡蛋的问题仍然没有解决。今年八月北京天气最热时，北京市公司因腐臭变质而损失的鸡蛋就达四万四千多斤。一九五四年，全国在这方面的损失共约一百万元左右。
    有些地方为了减少鸡蛋保管变质的损失，旺季时不敢放手收购，甚至停止收购，结果农民手中多余的鸡蛋卖不出去，收入减少了；淡季时，城市人民所需要的鸡蛋又供应不上。
    为了切实保管好鲜蛋，中国食品公司运用苏联先进经验，在北京建立了一个简易冷风仓库。这种仓库跟一般房子并没多大差别，只是在房顶上安设两个通风器，调节库里的湿度和更换空气；天棚和墙壁里填装稻壳，防御库外的热气或冷气侵入；夏天把掺盐的冰放在库内消热。这种仓库每平方公尺造价只有机制冷藏库的五分之一，管理很方便，也可以用来贮存水果和医药用品。用来贮藏鲜蛋，每公斤每月只要三分钱，比机制冷藏的费用少一半。如果采用天然冰或设法收回盐液，贮藏费还可以降低。
    现在，中国食品公司已修改了这座仓库设计中的某些缺点，决定再投资四百六十九万元，分别在江苏、山东、安徽、河北、河南和东北等主要鸡蛋产区以及北京、天津等主要消费城市里兴建这种仓库。这些仓库建成之后，大量损坏鸡蛋的现象将可避免。在这些地区，在旺季就可以适当收购鸡蛋，就地贮存，到淡季时，再运往城市，就可以保证城市居民经常吃到鲜蛋。（附图片）
