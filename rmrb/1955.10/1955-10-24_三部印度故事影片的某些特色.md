Some Features of Three Indian Story Films
Zhong Dianfei

In recent days, Chinese audiences have been watching and discussing with great interest the three Indian story films being screened in China this time - "Two Acres of Land" (screenwriter: H. Mukherjee, director: B. Roy), "The Vagabond" (screenwriter: K. Abbas, U.B. Sathe, director: Raj Kapoor) and "The Storm" (screenwriter and director: Chetan Anand). Because they truthfully reflect the lives of the Indian people, the vast Chinese audience can be said to have felt so closely connected to the Indian people for the first time, understanding their upright and kind character, their lives and aspirations.

The audience's interest is mainly focused on these aspects: the films' populism, national character and excellent film art skills.

I

First of all, these three films touch on issues of concern to the people, namely the landlord's exploitation of farmers ("Two Acres of Land"); the harm of the traditional caste system and fatalistic ideas ("The Vagabond"); and the oppression of ordinary people by urban usurers ("The Storm"). Because these problems have caused all kinds of misfortunes among the Indian people as depicted in the films, when the films raise these problems, they themselves have progressive significance.

The value of "Two Acres of Land" is not only because it is a film depicting the lives of farmers that appeared in the wave of so-called entertainment films deeply influenced by Hollywood, but also because the film completely stands on the side of sympathizing with farmers. The value of "The Vagabond" lies not only in its excellent narrative of a tragic story, but also in its strong opposition to the prejudices under the influence of the traditional caste system. People deeply sympathize with Raj because he is a victim of this prejudice. "The Storm" is a film that completely isolates usurers morally.

Because the authors deeply sympathize with the people, they show a strong tendency in artistic depiction. In "Two Acres of Land," landlords, capitalists and the judges and lackeys who serve them become the main targets of the film's attack; on the other hand, the landlady of the small inn, the wandering children who shine shoes, and even the thieves are portrayed as somewhat worthy of sympathy.

In "The Storm," this characteristic is particularly obvious. Here, almost everyone helps lawyer Ramohan, and hates the usurer Guberdas. The empty scene at Guberdas's wedding most clearly shows the film's ridicule of this class, and puts sympathy on the fate of Ramohan, the Janghi family and the maid Rani. The robber Jacka in "The Vagabond" is of course a negative character. But the film also points out the social reasons that made Jacka a robber. At the beginning of the film, he said to Rida: "One year, I was arrested, and it was your husband who tried the case and fabricated a crime for me. In fact, I had no crime at that time, just because I was the son of a robber, I was put in jail! Your husband ruined my life!"

It is precisely because these films strongly oppose the unfair phenomena in social life and criticize the landlords, usurers and others who hinder social progress that they also put forward their ideal characters, among which the most prominent are several kind, brave and self-sacrificing women. These are Shambo's wife Paro, Raj's lover Rita and the girl Rani who has a crush on Ramohan.

Paro is just an ordinary farm woman, and she represents many kind women in India. The film truthfully portrays her character. She is loyal to love and has the spirit of being unyielding in poverty and unbending before force. In the face of disaster, she knows almost nothing. When Shambo decides to go to Calcutta to earn money to pay the landlord's debt, she is worried that Shambo will change his mind when he arrives in a big place and will not love her anymore. But she loves Shambo, even when Shambo is penniless, she never said a word of complaint.

Rita and Rani are not as realistic as Paro, and have some fantasy elements. But their appearance is still of positive significance to the Indian people today. Rita is the strongest opponent of caste prejudice in the entire film "The Vagabond". In her capacity as a lawyer, she bravely defends Raj, a robber and murderer. Because she knows that Raj is innocent, and the guilty one is Raj's father, Ragunath. Therefore, she never hides her love for Raj from beginning to end. In "The Storm," the main character praised is Rani. When Rani confirmed what Ramohan said that he was going to marry "a beautiful girl" was Janghi instead of her, she was the first witness to spread the news, which gave her the first test of emotion - whether she could sacrifice her love for the happiness of others.

Some people feel that Rani's sacrifice of her life for Ramohan later is not worthwhile, because the relationship between them is that of master and servant; that is to say, this sacrifice lacks its necessary class basis. Yes, if there were no master-servant relationship between Rani and Ramohan, it would strengthen the social significance of this character. But from the entire film, the main problem lies in the contradiction between Ramohan, Rani, Janghi, Lala and others and the usurer Guberdas, Guberdas is their common enemy. Therefore, when Rani saw that the happiness between Ramohan and Janghi had been completely destroyed by Guberdas, she resolutely decided to sacrifice herself in the end - after stabbing Guberdas to death, she committed suicide by taking poison. It is precisely because Rani's self-sacrifice is closely related to the struggle against usurers that we affirm the significance of Rani's image in real life.

In the Indian film market, where about 250 foreign films are imported every year, and 90% of them are Hollywood films; in the Indian film market, where about 250 Indian films are produced every year, and progressive films account for only a very small number, the victory of progressive films cannot but be first due to the populism of the content it reflects, and its victory in realistic art creation.

II

The rich life style of Indian films - the characteristics of customs and language, make it rich in distinct national characteristics, and the film music, which is an important part of film art, has received extremely high praise from Chinese audiences, who believe that it explains these films with the most Indian language, and enriches the thoughts and feelings that these films want to express. It is particularly worth pointing out here that it bravely adheres to the path of national music in the encirclement of weird jazz music, which should also be regarded as a major victory for Indian progressive films.

The music of Indian progressive films is not only different from jazz music full of bourgeois decadent sentiments, but it also develops the tradition of Indian national music. It is precisely because the art of sound film was first developed from the West, so its latecomers thought that the so-called film music is such and such music based on Western music. Indian progressive film music composers have rejected this extremely unpromising idea in practice, which cannot but make us particularly excited.

It should be noted here that Indian film music does not generally exclude Western music. In some emotionally agitated and high-spirited places, the melody of Western music is still used, such as the music when Shambo and his son embrace each other after Shambo accidentally hits his son in "Two Acres of Land", and also the dubbing of "The Vagabond" and "The Storm". But we think that what is worth cherishing is its leading direction is national. We hope that it will attract the attention of our musicians, and that is precisely this point.

The songs of Indian films, like its dubbing, are distinctive - it replaces part of the role of language in the film, and strengthens the emotions that the film wants to express.

When we mention this, we understand the pain of Indian progressive film artists in this matter. They often have to take care of the fact that in today's Indian film market, a movie without a few songs and a few large dance scenes, the audience will not buy it, which also hinders some of their ideals in creation. The most obvious result is that the length of the film is increased beyond the general convention, making the film seem structurally loose in some places. But smart artists are sometimes very good at using song and dance scenes to solve this contradiction, such as the opening song and the wedding dance in "The Storm" are well combined with the content.

III

Indian progressive film artists are well-trained in their business. This is reflected in the fact that many screenwriters and directors are good at telling stories with films, and pay attention to seeking new film vocabularies, the diverse talents of actors and the full attention of all personnel to the modeling value of film pictures.

Among these three films, "The Vagabond" is the most story-like. But the story of "The Vagabond" is not complicated to tell in ordinary language. It only says that a judge's son later became a vagabond. The film is worth watching because it fully uses the language of film when telling this story. We saw in "The Vagabond" that Raj, who was called "Little Girl", was still thinking about shining shoes in class; when Raj went to steal bread for his mother, he was immediately caught by a fat hand, and immediately pushed to the police, Raj was tried in such a shot, and immediately put in jail; he was given a cake in jail, Raj was fascinated, laughed, thinking it was bread, so the film entered Raj's youth - from Raj of "Little Girl", entered Raj of a cynical professional robber. Throughout the film, Rita's childhood photos became the key to the story's connection and emotional conflict for Raj; Rita's voice-over and the robber Jacka's voice-over became an important expression of Raj's behavioral contradictions.

Therefore, when we feel the ideological power of this film, we also feel the power of film art.

The smoothness of "Two Acres of Land" in the chapter is also worthy of our attention. The film raises the issue of two acres of land in a very empathetic way from the image, and after Shambo arrives in the city, the life in the city and the life in the countryside are completely connected by the film.

The screenwriter and director of "The Storm", Chetan Anand, has made significant achievements in seeking new film vocabulary. The voice-over of Rani's memories of her relationship with Ramohan (Rani's psychological voice) not only excellently expresses Rani's mood at that time, but also saves the length of the film from showing their past from the front. In another place, when Ramohan told his mother about his relationship with Janghi, Ramohan, as the first person, never appeared in the same picture as Janghi. The director always uses Ramohan's first person as the keynote here, making this recall have a sense of intimacy; and Janghi appears in the picture in order to reflect the content of the recall, which strengthens the reality of the recall. The two recalls are closely linked, but the methods of expression are completely different.

The main actors Baraj Sani and Raj Kapoor, who directly undertook the creative tasks of these two films, are truly treasures of the Indian film industry. Sani's role as Shambo is most appropriately described by the two words "vivid" that we Chinese often say. In the short play before Shambo arrived in Calcutta, Sani completely determined the character's temperament characteristics (this mainly depends on his grasp of the rhythm and rhythm of the action). Therefore, in an overhead shot of Shambo walking on the streets of Calcutta, the people on the screen are very small, but we can still immediately distinguish who is Shambo among the bustling pedestrians.

Sani's entire characteristic in acting lies in being appropriate - the psychological depiction of the character is neither exaggerated nor embellished. Even when Shambo is taking a break on the street and asking another rickshaw driver "How much is a pair of shoes?", hearing that it costs two yuan, and then saying: "This is too expensive, I won't buy it, it's the same to wrap it with a piece of rag!" In such a very simple scene, we also see the entire impact of two acres of land on the character's psychology.

The young Raj performed by Raj Kapoor is entirely characterized by the essence of tragedy with a comedic appearance. In this regard, he is indeed very close to Chaplin. And it is precisely in this way that he can grasp the depth of the character's character. If the Shambo played by Sani is a realistic sketch of an Indian farmer, then the Raj played by Raj Kapoor is a colorful portrait of a vagabond. From his jokes in prison, later stealing watches, taking other people's bicycles, and immediately boarding the singing of the car in motion, we see a soul that is so lonely that he dare not tell the truth even to his mother; and when he finally comes out of Rita's house and goes to the beach, alone with a knife on the tree engraved Rita's name "Tear drops rolling" in the singing, we realize: How much Raj needs a normal human life. Therefore, we can say that if we leave the simple acting skills of Sani and the colorful acting skills of Raj Kapoor, then the ideological content of "Two Acres of Land" and "The Vagabond" cannot be expressed so deeply and movingly.

Finally, about the picture of the film, this should be considered the crystallization of the entire labor of the film artists. When the audience recalls these films in many years, the first thing that floats in his mind is these pictures - shots. For example, the lens of Shambo and Paro separating in "Two Acres of Land", the lens of Shambo and Genayan arriving in the streets of Calcutta for the first time, the lens of Shambo accidentally hitting Genayan and then pulling Genayan's hand and hitting his own face, are all due to its use of film techniques to concentrate on the drama in life, leaving people with a series of profound and moving pictures. In "The Vagabond", when Raj comes back from prison, "plays" with his master, and deceives his mother, Rita's photo suddenly appears on the wall, when the actor turns his face to look at the photo with his back to the audience, the picture is Rita's photo and the face of the criminal Raj! What this shot wants to show is a cruel picture of life; and in terms of modeling, it is extremely complete. After Judge Ragunath doubts his wife's chastity, there are many pictures of him facing away from the audience, and his dialogue with his wife allows us to only glimpse a huge back and a half-profile cunning face.

"The Vagabond" is a movie full of "dynamic" feeling, which is mainly because it uses all possible angles to present the movie picture to the audience from all directions. The use of several overhead long shots is particularly outstanding. For example, on little Rita's birthday, the camera is from the balloon passing through the roof and all the way to the medium shot of the children congratulating Rita, the entire process of this congratulation is solved with only two such long shots.

All of this shows that Indian progressive films have rich experience. Through the screening of these films, the Chinese people not only further understand India and enhance the friendship between our two countries, but also provide a good learning example for the young Chinese films.

    三部印度故事影片的某些特色
    锺惦棐
    这几天来，我国观众以极大的兴趣欣赏和谈论着此次在我国放映的三部印度故事影片——“两亩地”（编剧：赫·穆凯尔吉，导演：比·罗伊）、“流浪者”（编剧：克·阿巴斯，乌·布·萨特海，导演：拉兹·卡普尔）和“暴风雨”（编导：契坦·阿南德）。由于它们真实地反映了印度人民的生活，使中国广大观众可以说是第一次感觉到这样亲切地接近了印度人民，了解到他们的正直和善良的品性，他们的生活和愿望。
    观众的兴趣大体集中在这些方面：影片的人民性、民族色彩和优异的电影艺术技巧。
    一
    首先，这三部影片都接触到人民所关心的问题，这便是地主对农民的勒索（“两亩地”）；传统的种姓制度和宿命观念的危害（“流浪者”）；城市高利贷者对普通人民的欺压（“暴风雨”）。由于这些问题在印度人民中造成了如影片所描写的各式各样的不幸，因而当影片提出了这样一些问题的时候，它本身就是具有进步意义的。
    “两亩地”的可贵处不仅由于它是在深受好莱坞影响的所谓娱乐片浪潮中出现的描写农民生活的影片，还由于影片是完全站在同情农民这一方面的。“流浪者”的可贵处不只是在于它出色地叙述了一个悲剧性的故事，而且在于它强烈地反对传统的种姓制度影响下的偏见。人们深深地同情拉兹，正因为他是这种偏见的牺牲者。“暴风雨”则是把高利贷者从道义上完全孤立起来的影片。
    由于作者深切地同情人民，因而在艺术描写上表现了强烈的倾向性。在“两亩地”中，地主、资本家和为他们服务的法官、狗腿子，成为影片主要的攻击对象；而在另一方面，小旅社的老板娘，擦皮鞋的流浪儿童，甚至小偷，都被描写成为多少值得同情的人。
    在“暴风雨”中，这一特征被表现得尤为明显。这里，几乎一切人都帮助拉莫罕律师，而仇恨高利贷者。古贝尔达斯结婚时那个空空荡荡的场面，便最显明地表示了影片对这一阶层的嘲笑，而把同情放在拉莫罕、江吉一家人和女仆拉尼的命运上。“流浪者”中的强盗札卡当然是反面人物。但影片也仍然指出了使札卡成为强盗的社会原因。影片开头，他对里列说：“有一年，我被抓了去，是你丈夫审的案子，给我捏造了个罪名。其实那时候我什么罪也没有，就是因为我是强盗的儿子，就把我关进监狱里去啦！是你的丈夫断送了我这一生！”
    正是因为这些影片强烈反对社会生活中的不平现象，批判了阻碍社会进步的地主、高利贷者等人，同时也就提出了它们所理想的人物，而其中突出的是几个善良、勇敢和具有自我牺牲精神的女性。这便是向波的妻子芭萝，拉兹的爱人丽达和单恋着拉莫罕的女孩子拉尼。
    芭萝只是一个普通的农妇，她代表着许许多多印度的善良的妇女。影片真实地刻划了她的性格。她忠实于爱情，具有贫贱不能移，威武不能屈的精神。在灾难面前，她几乎什么也不知道，当向波决定了要去加尔各答挣钱来还地主的账时，她还担心向波到了大地方会变了心，不爱她了。但是她爱向波，便是当向波一贫如洗的时候，她也绝没有说过一句呕气话。
    丽达和拉尼，在现实性上不如芭萝，而带着若干幻想的成分。但她们的出现，对今天印度人民仍是有积极意义的。丽达在“流浪者”整个影片中，是反对种姓偏见最强烈的人。她以她的律师身份，勇敢地为一个强盗、杀人犯拉兹辩护。因为她了解拉兹是没有罪的，有罪的是拉兹的父亲拉贡纳特。因而自始至终她都不掩饰她对拉兹的爱情。在“暴风雨”中，被歌颂的主要人物是拉尼。当拉尼证实了拉莫罕所说的要和“一个漂亮姑娘”结婚乃是江吉而不是她时，她作为第一个见证人去传播了这一消息，这给了她情感上最初的考验——她是否能够为了别人的幸福牺牲自己的爱情。
    有人觉得拉尼后来竟为拉莫罕牺牲了生命的事情是不值得的，因为存在于他们之间的是主仆关系；也就是说，这种牺牲是缺乏它必要的阶级基础。是的，如果拉尼和拉莫罕之间不存在这种主仆关系，将会更加强这一性格的社会意义。但从整个影片看来，主要问题在于拉莫罕、拉尼、江吉以及拉拉等人和高利贷者古贝尔达斯之间的矛盾，古贝尔达斯是他们共同的敌人。因此，当拉尼眼看拉莫罕与江吉之间的幸福已经完全被古贝尔达斯所破坏时，她便毅然决定最后地牺牲自己——在刺杀了古贝尔达斯之后，服毒自杀了。正是因为拉尼的自我牺牲同反抗高利贷者的斗争有着密切的联系，我们便肯定了拉尼这一形象在现实生活中的意义。
    在每年有二百五十部左右的外国影片进口，而其中百分之九十是好莱坞影片的印度电影市场上；在年产二百五十部左右的印度影片，而进步影片只占极少数量的印度电影市场上，进步影片的胜利，不能不首先是由于它所反映的内容的人民性，和它在艺术创作上的现实主义的胜利。
    二
    印度影片中浓郁的生活情调——风俗习惯及语言等方面的特征，使它富有鲜明的民族色彩，而其中作为电影艺术的重要组成部分的电影音乐，在我国观众中获得了极高的评价，认为它是以最富于印度色彩的语言来解释了这些影片，丰富了这些影片所要表达的思想感情。这里特别值得指出的是：它在怪声怪气的爵士音乐的包围中勇敢地坚持了民族音乐的道路，这同样应视为印度进步电影的重大胜利。
    印度进步电影的音乐不仅与充满了资产阶级糜烂情调的爵士音乐区别开来，而且它发展了印度民族音乐的传统。正是因为有声电影这门艺术首先是从西方发展起来的，所以它的后起者以为所谓电影音乐，就是如此如彼的以西方音乐为范本的音乐。印度进步电影音乐作曲家在实践中排斥了这种极没出息的思想，这不能不特别使我们兴奋。
    这里应该说明：印度电影音乐也并不一般地排斥西方音乐。在若干感情激动高昂的地方，也仍然采用了西方音乐的旋律，如“两亩地”在向波错打了儿子之后父子两人拥抱在一起时的音乐，以及如“流浪者”和“暴风雨”的配音，也都是这样。但我们以为值得珍视的是它的主导方向是民族的。我们希望它引起我国音乐家重视的，也正是这一点。
    印度电影的歌曲，也和它的配音一样，是具有特色的——它在影片中代替了一部分语言的作用，而且把影片所要表达的情感加重了。
    当我们提到这点的时候，我们是懂得印度进步电影艺术家们在这事情上的苦闷的。他们往往为了要照顾到在今天印度电影市场上一部电影如果没有几支歌曲，没有几个较大的舞蹈场面，观众就不买账的事实，这也就妨碍了他们在创作上的某些理想。最明显的结果是超乎一般惯例地增加了影片的长度，使影片在某些地方显得结构松散。但聪明的艺术家们有时却很善于运用歌舞场面，解决这一矛盾，比如“暴风雨”开头的歌曲和结婚时的舞蹈就都是和内容结合得很好的。
    三
    印度进步电影艺术家们对于自己的业务是有素养的。这表现在许多编剧家和导演们善于用电影来讲述故事，并注意寻求新的电影语汇，演员的多种多样的才能和全体人员都充分注意电影画面的造型价值。
    在这三部影片中，“流浪者”是最富于故事性的。但是“流浪者”的故事要用普通的语言讲起来，却也并不复杂。它只是说：一个法官的儿子后来成了流浪者。影片有看头，是在于它叙述这故事的时候，充分地使用了电影的语言。我们在“流浪者”中看到，被人称做“小姑娘”的拉兹，上课时还想着擦皮鞋的事情；拉兹为了母亲去偷面包的时候，立刻被一只肥胖的手抓住了，而且立刻便被推向警察的面前，拉兹便在这样一个镜头下受审，并且立刻被关进监狱；牢里发给他一张饼，拉兹看得出神，大笑，以为是面包，这样影片便进入了青年时代的拉兹——从“小姑娘”的拉兹，进入了玩世不恭的职业强盗的拉兹。在整个影片进行中，丽达小时的照片，成为故事连结和引起拉兹感情上的冲突的关键；丽达的画外音和强盗札卡的画外音，又成为拉兹行为上陷于矛盾的重要表现。
    因而当我们感到这一影片的思想力量的时候，同时也感到电影艺术的力量。
    “两亩地”在章法上的流畅，同样是值得我们注意的。影片从形象上很令人感同身受地提出了两亩地的问题，而且在向波到城里以后，城里的生活和乡村的生活完全被电影联结在一起。
    “暴风雨”的编导契坦·阿南德在寻求新的电影语汇上是有显著成绩的。拉尼回忆她和拉莫罕的交往时的画外音（拉尼心理上的声音），不仅优异地表现了拉尼当时的心情，而且因此省掉了从正面去表现他们的往事的篇幅。另一处，当拉莫罕对母亲讲到他和江吉的关系时，作为第一人称的拉莫罕则始终没有出现在和江吉的同一画面上。导演在此始终以拉莫罕的第一人称作基调，使这回述具有亲切感；而江吉为了照映回述的内容出现在画面上，又加强了回述的实在感。两段回述紧相连结着，而表现的方法却绝不相同。
    直接负担了这两部影片的创造任务的主要演员巴拉吉·萨尼和拉兹·卡普尔，真称得起是印度电影界的瑰宝。萨尼扮演的向波，用我们中国常说的“传神”这两个字来形容，是最恰当不过的。在向波到达加尔各答之前的不长的戏中，萨尼便把角色的气质特征完全确定下来了（这主要依靠他对动作的韵律和节奏的把握）。因而当向波在加尔各答街上行走的一个俯瞰镜头中，画面上出现的人很小，但我们仍然能够在熙来攘往的行人之中立刻分辨出谁是向波。
    萨尼在演技上的全部特征在于恰如其分——对角色的心理描绘既不夸张，也不虚饰。甚至当向波是在街头小息时问另一个洋车夫“鞋子多少钱一双？”听说要两块钱，然后说：“这太贵了，我不买，找块破布包上不一样嘛！”这样极简单的场面中，我们也看见两亩地在角色心理上的全部影响。
    拉兹·卡普尔所表演的青年时代的拉兹，全部是以喜剧的外表而刻划出悲剧的本质。在这一点上，他确是很接近卓别麟的。而正是这样，他就得以把握住了角色性格上的深度。如果说萨尼扮演的向波是一幅真实的印度农民的素描，那末拉兹·卡普尔扮演的拉兹，便是一幅流浪者的彩色斑烂的肖像。从他在监狱中的谐谑，后来偷表，夺取别人的自行车，而又立刻登上行驶中的汽车的歌唱中，我们看出一个孤独到连对母亲也不敢说真话的灵魂；而在当他最后一次从丽达家里出来，到了海边，独自一人用小刀在树上刻丽达的名字的“泪珠儿滚滚”的歌唱中，我们体会到：拉兹是多么需要正常的人的生活。因此我们可以说，如果离开了像萨尼这样质朴和拉兹·卡普尔这样多彩的演技，那末，“两亩地”和“流浪者”的思想内容是无法表现得如此深刻动人的。
    最后，关于电影的画面，这应该认为是电影艺术家们全部劳动的结晶的东西。当观众在若干年后来回忆这些影片时，首先浮现在他的脑子里的，便是这些画面——镜头。比如“两亩地”中向波和芭萝分别的镜头，向波和格奈扬初到加尔各答市街上的镜头，向波误打了格奈扬之后而又拉着格奈扬的手打自己脸的镜头，都由于它运用电影的手法集中地表现了生活中的戏剧，而留给人一幅幅深刻动人的图画。在“流浪者”中，当拉兹从监狱回来，“玩”了他的师父，又骗过他的母亲以后，墙上突然出现了丽达的照片，当演员背着观众而转脸看这照片时，画面上是丽达的照片和犯罪的拉兹的脸！这镜头要显示的，乃是一幅残酷的人生的图画；而在造型上看，又极其完整。法官拉贡纳特在怀疑妻子的贞洁以后，有不少画面是背向观众的，他和妻子的对话，使我们只能窥见一个庞大的背影和一个半侧面的狡诈的脸。
    “流浪者”是一部充满着“动”的感觉的电影，这主要是由于它利用了一切可能的角度，从各个方向把电影画面呈现在观众之前。其中若干俯视的长镜的运用是尤为出色的。如小丽达的生日，镜头便是从通过屋顶的汽球而一直摇到小孩子们为丽达祝贺的中景，这祝贺的全部过程，就只用两个这样的长镜头解决了的。
    所有这些，都表明印度进步电影是有着丰富的经验的。通过这几部影片的上映，我国人民不仅进一步了解了印度，更增强了我们两个国家的友谊，而且，对于年轻的中国电影来说，也提供了很好的学习榜样。
