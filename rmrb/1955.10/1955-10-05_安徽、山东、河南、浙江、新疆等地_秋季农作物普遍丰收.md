    Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Zhejiang, Xinjiang and Other Places
    Autumn Crops Generally Have a Bumper Harvest
    (Reported by this newspaper) Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Zhejiang, Xinjiang and other places have generally achieved bumper harvests of autumn crops.
    Following the summer harvest, Anhui Province achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest of early and mid-season rice on 27 million mu of land. This year, a total of 10.16 billion jin of grain was produced, exceeding the state-assigned task by 23 percent, and representing an increase of 900 million jin compared to 1952, the year with the highest output. This achievement is due to the comprehensive implementation of three reforms in agricultural production, centered on agricultural cooperatives and driving mutual aid teams and individual farmers. This year, 480,000 mu of dry land was converted to paddy fields for rice cultivation, increasing production by more than 100 million jin compared to planting dry land crops. Double-cropping early rice was expanded to 2.48 million mu, an increase of seven and a half times compared to last year. The yield per mu reached 400 jin, and the rice grew normally, matured in a timely manner, did not delay subsequent crops, and avoided the threat of drought and floods.
    According to preliminary estimates, Shandong Province's more than 10 million mu of peanuts planted this year can produce an average of more than 140 jin of peanut kernels per mu, slightly higher than last year's actual yield. Shandong farmers, in response to the state's call to increase the planting of oil crops, expanded the peanut planting area by 5.9 percent compared to last year, and paid more attention to strengthening field management. For example, when a serious drought occurred in the Wendeng Special District after the wheat harvest this year, under the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, the vast number of farmers launched a drought resistance campaign, ensuring the growth of peanuts. At present, farmers throughout the province are actively strengthening the late-stage field management of peanuts, striving for a greater harvest.
    Henan Province's more than 11 million mu of cotton generally achieved a bumper harvest. According to the estimate of the Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Office of the Provincial People's Committee, the province will overfulfill the state-assigned cotton production increase task this year, and can produce more than 370 million jin of ginned cotton. Now, cotton farmers in Henan Province are busily picking cotton, and are actively selling the first and second rounds of cotton to the state. As of September 20, the province had purchased 22 million jin of new ginned cotton. This year, the Yellow River irrigation area achieved its fourth bumper harvest year since irrigation began. The 213,000 mu of cotton and 340,000 mu of late autumn crops in the entire irrigation area generally increased production by 20 percent compared to last year, and some increased by more than 30 percent.
    Zhejiang Province's total cotton output this year will increase by 15 to 20 percent compared to last year, and the production increase plan can be overfulfilled. Although Xiaoshan County's cotton suffered from insect pests, each mu can still complete the production plan of 150 jin of seed cotton, an increase of 20 percent compared to last year. The superiority of agricultural cooperatives was fully demonstrated in cotton production. More than 90 percent of the agricultural production cooperatives in the cotton-producing areas of the province have achieved bumper cotton harvests. The 290 mu of cotton in the first agricultural cooperative of Yuncheng Township, Cixi County, produced an average of 120 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 26 percent compared to last year. At present, farmers in cotton-producing areas are busily engaged in cotton picking.
    The Xinjiang Agricultural Production Corps' more than 150,000 mu of cotton is estimated to yield an average of 327 jin of seed cotton per mu. The unit area yield increased by 102 percent compared to 1954, and by 47 percent compared to 1953. Among them, the Manas River Reclamation Area, which is rich in cotton in Xinjiang, has more than 82,000 mu of cotton, and it is expected that each mu will produce an average of 420 jin of seed cotton. The Agricultural Production Corps' more than 100,000 mu of oil crops also achieved a bumper harvest, with an estimated total output of 9.54 million jin; an average of 88 jin per mu, and the unit area yield increased by 30 percent compared to last year.

    秋季农作物普遍丰收
    本报讯　安徽、山东、河南、浙江、新疆等地的秋季农作物普遍获得丰收。
    安徽省在夏季丰收以后，二千七百万亩的早、中稻又获得全面丰收。今年共生产粮食一百零一亿六千万斤，超过国家规定任务百分之二十三，比最高年产量的一九五二年增产九亿斤。这一成绩的取得，是由于全面贯彻了以农业合作社为中心，带动互助组和个体农民，大力推行了农业生产上的三项改革。今年旱地改水田改种水稻四十八万亩，比种旱粮增产一亿斤以上，双季早稻扩种了二百四十八万亩，比去年扩大了七倍半，每亩产量达四百斤，而且生长正常，适时成熟，不误后作，并可避开旱涝威胁。
    山东省今年种植的一千多万亩花生，据初步估计平均每亩可产花生米一百四十多斤，略高于去年的实产量。山东农民为了响应国家增种油料作物的号召，花生播种面积比去年扩大了百分之五点九，并比过去注意了加强田间管理工作。如文登专区今年麦后发生了严重的旱象，在农业生产合作社和互助组的带动下，广大农民开展了抗旱运动，保证了花生的生长。目前全省农民正积极地加强花生的后期田间管理，争取更大丰收。
    河南省一千一百多万亩棉花普遍丰收。据省人民委员会农林水利办公室估计，全省今年将超额完成国家给予的棉花增产任务，可产皮棉三亿七千余万斤。现在，河南省棉农们正紧张采摘棉花，并积极将头、二喷花出售给国家。全省截至九月二十日止，已收购新皮棉两千二百万斤。今年引黄灌溉区获得开始灌溉以来的第四个丰收年。全灌溉区二十一万三千亩棉花和三十四万亩晚秋作物一般比去年增产二成，有的增产三成以上。
    浙江省今年棉花总产量将比去年增加百分之十五到二十，可超额完成增产计划。萧山县棉花虽然遭受虫害，每亩仍可完成一百五十斤籽花的产量计划，比去年增产两成。在棉花生产中，充分显示了农业合作社的优越性，全省产棉区的农业生产合作社百分之九十以上都获得棉花丰收。慈谿县云城乡第一农业社的二百九十亩棉花，平均每亩产皮棉一百二十斤，比去年增产二成六。目前，产棉区的农民们都紧张地投入棉花的采摘工作。
    新疆农业生产部队十五万多亩棉花，估计平均每亩可收籽棉三百二十七斤。单位面积产量比一九五四年提高百分之一百零二；比一九五三年提高百分之四十七。其中新疆盛产棉花的玛纳斯河垦区，有八万二千多亩棉花，预计平均每亩可产四百二十斤籽棉。农业生产部队十万多亩油料作物也获得丰收，预计总产量可达九百五十四万斤；平均每亩可产八十八斤，单位面积产量比去年提高百分之三十。
