Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 28th: The Czechoslovak News Agency reported on the 27th that the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic has decided to accept the invitation of the Egyptian government to serve on the Sudan International Committee. The task of the Sudan International Committee will be to supervise the measures for Sudan's transition from Anglo-Egyptian condominium to an independent state. Sudan can choose to merge with Egypt in some form or become completely independent. The International Committee will also ensure a neutral atmosphere in the country during this important phase of Sudan's development.

The Czechoslovak News Agency pointed out: The Egyptian government sent an invitation to the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic on October 21, 1955, inviting it to participate in the Sudan International Committee, and expressed its hope that Czechoslovakia would accept the position of member of the committee. At the same time, it requested that the name of the representative of the Czechoslovak Republic be notified to it. Later, the British government informed the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic that it considered the Egyptian government's invitation to be premature. The Government of the Czechoslovak Republic considered this to be a notification expressing the British government's views.

In view of these facts, the Czechoslovak News Agency is authorized to announce: The Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, which has always been willing to contribute to international cooperation, taking into account the invitation issued by the Egyptian government regarding the lofty task of the committee in the process of Sudan's self-determination, has decided to accept the position of member of the committee and appoint its representative to assume responsibilities in the committee together with other members.

The Government of the Czechoslovak Republic has notified the governments of Egypt, Britain, and the countries nominated as members of the Sudan International Committee – namely India, Pakistan, Yugoslavia, Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway – of this decision.

    捷政府应邀担任苏丹国际委员会委员职务
    新华社布拉格二十八日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社二十七日报道，捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府已经决定接受埃及政府的邀请，担任苏丹国际委员会委员的职务。苏丹国际委员会的任务将是，监督使苏丹从英埃共管过渡到独立国家的措施。苏丹可以选择同埃及作某种形式的合并或完全独立。国际委员会还将在苏丹发展的这个重要阶段保证国内的中立气氛。
    捷克斯洛伐克通讯社指出：埃及政府在一九五五年十月二十一日向捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府发出了请它参加苏丹国际委员会的邀请，并且表示希望捷克斯洛伐克将接受这个委员会的委员职务。同时，它要求把捷克斯洛伐克共和国代表的名字通知它。后来，英国政府通知捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府说，它认为埃及政府的邀请未免为时过早，捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府认为这是表达英国政府看法的一个通知。
    鉴于这些事实，捷克斯洛伐克通讯社受权宣布：一向愿意对国际合作作出贡献的捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府考虑到埃及政府发出的关于这个委员会在苏丹自决过程中担任崇高任务的邀请，已经决定接受这个委员会的委员职务，任命它的代表同其他委员一道承担委员会中的职责。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府已经把这个决定通知埃及、英国和被提名为苏丹国际委员会委员的各个国家——即印度、巴基斯坦、南斯拉夫、瑞士、瑞典和挪威——的政府。
