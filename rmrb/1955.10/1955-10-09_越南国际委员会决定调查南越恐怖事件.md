    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th. According to Vietnam News Agency: The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam has decided to investigate the massacre of ninety-two residents in Huong Dien commune, Quang Tri province, by the Ngo Dinh Diem regime in July. At the same time, the International Commission has also decided to send a mobile inspection team to investigate other terrorist incidents in South Vietnam involving reprisals against former resistance personnel.
    On October 4, two residents, Nguyen Tien Luc and Nguyen Thi Van, who survived the Huong Dien commune massacre arrived in Hanoi to accuse the Ngo Dinh Diem regime of slaughtering the people before the International Commission in Vietnam. Nguyen Tien Luc and Nguyen Thi Van were received by representatives of the International Commission, who, after further questioning, accepted their indictment.
    The massacre occurred in July. At that time, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, under the guise of an "anti-communist movement," killed a total of ninety-two residents in Tan Hiep and Tan Lap villages in Huong Dien commune, including thirty-one children and seven pregnant women. At the same time, Ngo Dinh Diem's people looted the property of the villagers and set fire to their houses.
    After this barbaric massacre, residents of neighboring villages, fearing similar reprisals, moved elsewhere.
    This incident aroused strong indignation among the Vietnamese people. The Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army to the International Commission in Vietnam wrote to the International Commission on September 22 to protest this brutal act.

    越南国际委员会决定调查南越恐怖事件
    新华社河内八日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南国际监督和监察委员会已经决定调查吴庭艳政权七月间在广治省香田乡屠杀九十二个居民的事件。同时，国际委员会还决定派遣机动视察小组调查在南越发生的对前抗战人员进行报复的其他恐怖事件。
    十月四日，两个在香田乡大屠杀中幸存的居民阮进录和阮氏云到达河内向越南国际委员会控告了吴庭艳政权屠杀人民的罪行。阮进录和阮氏云受到了国际委员会代表们的接见，代表们在作了进一步的询问之后，接受了他们的控诉书。
    这个大屠杀事件是在七月间发生的。当时，吴庭艳集团在“反共运动”的幌子下先后在香田乡的新协村和新立村杀害了共九十二个居民，其中有三十一个儿童和七个孕妇。同时，吴庭艳分子还抢光了村中居民的财产，并且放火烧毁了村中的房屋。
    在这次野蛮的大屠杀事件发生以后，邻近各村庄的居民因为害怕遭受类似的报复，都迁到别处。
    这一事件在越南人民中激起了强烈的愤慨。越南人民军总司令部驻越南国际委员会的联络代表团已在九月二十二日写信给国际委员会就这一残暴行为提出抗议。
