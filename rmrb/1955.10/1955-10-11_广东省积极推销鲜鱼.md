Guangdong Province Actively Promotes Fresh Fish

    In order to meet the people's need for fresh fish, Guangdong Province is actively expanding its fresh fish sales efforts. The aquatic products departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in coastal production areas have overcome the shortage of transportation tools in fresh sales by organizing bicycle transportation teams, shoulder-carrying teams, and utilizing small vendors. From January to August this year, the province's fresh fish sales totaled more than 560,000 dan, an increase of nearly seven times compared to the same period last year.
    In order to further expand fresh fish sales, the Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company, in addition to having already built ten icehouses, one cold storage warehouse, and equipped a refrigerated transport vehicle this year, is now actively preparing to build five more icehouses, the Zhanjiang ice-making plant with a daily ice production of 15 tons, the Haikou cold storage warehouse with a capacity of 1,000 dan, and two refrigerated transport ships with a load capacity of 100 tons. These projects are all striving to be completed and put into production by the end of this year.

    广东省积极推销鲜鱼
    广东省为了满足人民对新鲜鱼货的需要，积极扩大鱼货鲜销工作。沿海各产区的水产部门和供销合作社，通过组织自行车运输队，肩挑队和利用小商小贩，克服了鲜销中运输工具不足的困难。今年一月到八月，全省鲜销鱼货共达五十六万多担，比去年同期增加了将近七倍。
    为了进一步扩大鱼货鲜销，广东省水产供销公司，今年除已建成十个冰库、一个冷藏库并置备一部冷藏运输车外，现在正积极筹建的还有五个冰库，和每日制冰十五吨的湛江制冰厂、容量一千担的海口冷藏库，以及载重一百吨的冷藏运输船二艘。这些工程都争取在今年年底完工投入生产。
