    Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: According to a TASS report from Paris on the 8th, the French National Assembly continued its debate on the French government's policy on Morocco on the 7th.
    Social Republican Party member Debunois accused the Faure government of "weakness" in handling the Moroccan issue.
    Following him was Communist Party member François Billoux. He pointed out that the bloodshed currently occurring in Morocco is the result of the French ruling circles' failure to grant the country national independence for many years. He warned that continuing to refuse to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the Moroccan people would have serious consequences not only in Morocco but also in France. He said that the Moroccan patriots would not stop their struggle.
    Billoux, on behalf of the French Communist Party, put forward a plan to resolve the Moroccan issue based on immediately abandoning the policy of war and repression in Morocco. He simultaneously put forward the following demands: to cease military operations and police terror, to release and grant amnesty to political prisoners, to give all exiled Moroccan patriots the opportunity to return to their homeland, to lift the death sentences imposed on patriots, to lift martial law in Morocco, to restore democratic freedoms, to guarantee the freedom of activity of the Moroccan Communist Party and various nationalist parties, to stop sending new troops and police to Morocco, and to return the troops that had recently been transferred there to France.
    Billoux suggested starting negotiations with representatives who are entitled to represent the Moroccan people and fulfilling the following promises: to allow former Sultan Yusuf to return to France from Madagascar, to establish a Council of the Throne and to begin the establishment of a representative government with the participation of representatives from various Moroccan parties and groups. Billoux also argued that political, economic, and cultural agreements must be drafted to establish new relations between France and Morocco on a completely equal footing.

    法国共产党提出解决摩洛哥问题的计划
    新华社九日讯　据塔斯社巴黎八日讯：法国国民议会七日继续辩论法国政府对摩洛哥的政策。
    社会共和党议员德伯努维指责富尔政府处理摩洛哥问题“软弱”。
    接着发言的是共产党议员弗朗索瓦·皮佑。他指出，现在在摩洛哥发生的流血事件是法国统治集团许多年来不给这个国家以民族独立的结果。他警告说，继续拒绝满足摩洛哥人民的正当愿望不仅会在摩洛哥而且还会在法国引起严重后果。他说，摩洛哥的爱国者是不会停止他们的斗争的。
    皮佑代表法国共产党提出一项以立刻放弃在摩洛哥进行战争和镇压的政策为基础的解决摩洛哥问题的计划。他同时提出了下列要求：停止军事行动和警察恐怖行动，释放和大赦政治犯，给所有被放逐的摩洛哥爱国者以返回祖国的机会，解除对爱国者判处的死刑，在摩洛哥取消戒严状态，恢复民主自由，保障摩洛哥共产党和各民族主义党派的自由活动，停止派遣新的军队和警察往摩洛哥，并且把最近几周中已经调到那里去的部队调回法国。
    皮佑建议开始同有权代表摩洛哥人民的代表谈判，并且履行下列诺言：使前苏丹优素福人马达加斯加回到法国，成立王位委员会和着手成立有摩洛哥各党派和团体代表参加的代议制政府。皮佑还主张必须拟定政治、经济和文化协定以使法国同摩洛哥在完全平等的基础上建立起新的关系。
