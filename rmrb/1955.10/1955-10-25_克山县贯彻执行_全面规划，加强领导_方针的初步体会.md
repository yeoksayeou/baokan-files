Preliminary Experiences of Keshan County in Implementing the Policy of "Overall Planning, Strengthening Leadership"
Chen Junsheng, Secretary of the Keshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Heilongjiang Province

The cooperative planning work and the production planning work centered on cooperativization in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, were roughly carried out in two stages. From the spring plowing to after the autumn harvest in 1954, the cooperative "layered planning, perennial preparation, and phased development" planning work was carried out. Before the spring plowing in 1955, a large number of cooperatives were established, and the focus was on production planning centered on cooperativization. The general process of these two stages of planning work is as follows:

I

From the winter of 1953 to before the spring plowing in 1954, a large number of new cooperatives were established throughout the county. At that time, the main problem was the passive leadership, and the masses could not grasp the intentions of the leadership. For example, in many districts at that time, the following situation occurred: the district committee originally thought that ten cooperatives could be established in the district, but the branch reported fifteen or twenty; and sometimes the district committee thought that several more cooperatives could be established in a certain village, but after investigation, the conditions were not met. From the autumn of 1953 to the spring of 1954, the county party committee also changed its plan for developing cooperatives several times. Of course, once any work plan is formulated, it cannot remain unchanged, but the changes in the plan for developing cooperatives at that time were somewhat blind. For example, the first time the county party committee consulted with the district party committees and decided to develop one hundred cooperatives, but soon the districts reduced it to eighty, and then to sixty. After carrying out the propaganda of the general line and a series of work, the socialist enthusiasm of the masses was improved, but the leadership still used the original perspective to look at the problem, resulting in the masses demanding to establish cooperatives, and the leadership was caught in a passive response, and the plan was broken through layer by layer. In the end, the number of new cooperatives established was not sixty, nor one hundred, but three hundred and fifty. In this situation, many problems arose. On the one hand, due to the lack of prior preparation, the quality of the cooperative establishment work was rough. For example, some districts once used the so-called "assembly line" method of establishing cooperatives, that is, wherever there was a request to establish a cooperative, district cadres were temporarily sent to help. After this cooperative was established, another "connection" was made when there was a request to establish a cooperative. This created a situation where the work of establishing cooperatives rose and fell one after another, and the leadership was overwhelmed. In this situation, it is conceivable that the policy of voluntary mutual benefit was not well implemented. On the other hand, some leaders, in the context of the high enthusiasm of the masses, were afraid that the "movement" would go too far, so they indiscriminately "suppressed" it, resulting in the appearance of "spontaneous cooperatives" in a few places in the county. After that, in accordance with the spirit of the Central Second Rural Work Conference and the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the County Party Committee launched the "overall planning, perennial preparation, phased development" "registration" work in the county. The main work content was: the county and districts made plans for the development of cooperatives in advance (including the establishment of new cooperatives, the expansion of old cooperatives, and the establishment of mutual aid groups), and the village branches also made plans. The plan of the branch was not a general estimate, but was formulated on the basis of the masses voluntarily requesting "registration" after a series of propaganda and education work. The county and district plans were revised based on the village branch plans. In this way, not only did the leadership have a clear idea, but also the masses grasped the intention of the leadership, and "both the top and the bottom had a clear understanding." After the cooperative establishment object groups were roughly determined, the district committee and village branch first adjusted and equipped the backbone forces of the cooperatives and groups, and then helped the cooperative establishment object groups to make cooperative establishment plans. Arrangements were made for what preparations to do for cooperative establishment, when to establish, and how to establish, etc. In order to enable the mutual aid groups preparing to transfer to cooperatives to "do a good job in production, create conditions, and strive to establish cooperatives," two hundred and seventy-one cooperative establishment preparatory committees were established throughout the county. Five hundred and forty-two mutual aid group leaders preparing to transfer to cooperatives were elected as directors of the preparatory committees. Later, most of them were elected as directors of the new cooperatives. In addition, the district and village cadres also helped the general mutual aid groups arrange production, and some mutual aid groups also put forward the goal of creating conditions for establishing cooperatives. After the above-mentioned work, the cooperative establishment preparation work in the county was roughly incorporated into an overall plan. However, a large number of cooperatives were not established all at once, but were "developed in batches" based on the different preparations of each cooperative based on the plan. By the autumn harvest of 1954, the work of establishing new cooperatives in the county was largely completed. Four hundred and twenty new cooperatives were established, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounted for 52.3 percent of the total number of peasant households. Together with the original cooperatives, there were eight hundred and forty-seven cooperatives, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives reached 72.7 percent of the total number of peasant households. The difference between this batch of new cooperatives and the new cooperatives established from the winter of 1953 to the spring of 1954 is: the preparation time was longer; the cooperative establishment work was more detailed; the awareness and enthusiasm for production of the members were higher; and the leading backbone was stronger. From the perspective of leadership, the cooperative establishment work was basically carried out in a planned and prepared manner, avoiding passive phenomena. Therefore, the annual cooperative establishment plan was completed earlier, and the new cooperatives had more time to prepare for production in the coming year. Of course, there were still shortcomings in the work. At that time, because there was no clear understanding of the policy of "overall planning, strengthening leadership," the work was still blind; the class policy of the party was not thoroughly implemented, and not enough attention was paid to the issue of old, weak, and disabled peasants joining the cooperatives; there was a phenomenon of forcibly pulling middle peasants into the cooperatives and not taking care of the interests of middle peasants; and in a few places, the composition of new members was not paid attention to, so that landlords and rich peasants drilled into the cooperatives.

II

The establishment of a large number of new cooperatives in the county has changed the relations of production in rural areas, and the productive capacity has also increased accordingly. According to the situation of most of the old cooperatives in the county, the general situation is: male laborers work about 150 days a year in mutual aid groups, and more than 200 days in cooperatives. The number of women participating in labor has increased significantly compared with mutual aid groups; at the same time, new agricultural tools are used in relatively large quantities, and the number of livestock and production investment has increased, etc. In this way, cooperatives need more content in order to meet the requirements of members to develop production. Although we have done a lot of work in leading the production of cooperatives in the past few years, the measures taken are far from meeting the requirements of the broad masses of peasants to develop production because of insufficient understanding of the new situation of increased productivity after a large number of cooperatives were established. Later, enlightened by the Provincial Party Committee and learning from the experience of overall planning centered on cooperativization created by the Provincial Party Committee in Shuangcheng County, we carried out production planning centered on cooperativization in the county. That is, according to the new situation of increased productive capacity, comprehensive and systematic production increase measures are formulated, and the production content of cooperatives is gradually enriched, so that cooperatives can increase production more. The benefits of doing so are: the cooperative movement is preliminarily combined with improving production, the production of cooperatives and the national plan, and it can encourage cadres and peasants to complete the plan and increase production with confidence. The initial effects of Keshan County after carrying out production planning are: first, the area of high-yield and stable-yield crops has been expanded. The planting area of corn in the county this year has increased by more than 118 percent compared with last year. Due to the increase in corn and the decrease in low-yield crops, it is estimated that the county can increase grain production by more than 10,000 tons. Secondly, the cooperatives reclaimed 3,819 hectares of wasteland in the spring and autumn this year, accounting for 2.2 percent of the existing planting area (excluding the 6,300 hectares of wasteland reclaimed by tractor stations and state farms for immigrants to the cooperatives). It is estimated that the newly reclaimed wasteland can increase grain production by at least one ton per hectare, and the reclamation of wasteland by cooperatives in the spring and autumn alone can increase grain production by more than 3,800 tons. Thirdly, the paddy field area of cooperatives has increased by 11.6 percent compared with last year. The Gucheng Farm alone has newly increased 100 hectares of paddy fields, which is estimated to produce 7,000 catties per hectare, which can increase production by a total of 700,000 catties. At present, another 124 cooperatives plan to develop paddy fields, and it is estimated that the paddy field area will increase by about 247 percent compared with this year next year. In addition, the fertilizer accumulation area of cooperatives can generally increase by about 10 percent compared with last year; the cultivation technology has been improved, and the land inspected and seedlings replanted by cooperatives has reached 3,670 hectares, which is rare in the past; the cooperatives promoted 1,602 hectares of improved wheat varieties, which can increase production by more than 80 percent per hectare compared with general wheat.

III

The aforementioned situation shows that the policy of "overall planning, strengthening leadership" put forward by the Central Committee in the rural cooperativization movement is completely correct. We feel that the main advantage of implementing this policy is that it fully embodies the leadership method of combining leadership with the masses.

From the perspective of county, district, and village leadership work, if we can earnestly implement the policy of "overall planning, strengthening leadership," we can make our work more systematic, comprehensive, and proactive. This is because: First, implementing "overall planning" can incorporate rural work into the overall plan, so that we have a clear idea in mind and can grasp the progress of the entire work from the overall situation, without being in a situation of responding to emergencies. In this way, the leadership is proactive. Second, "overall planning" should not only plan today's work, but also plan tomorrow's work; it should not only have temporary measures, but also have fundamental measures. Therefore, the leadership can carry out work in a step-by-step manner, without doing it piecemeal, so that the work is more systematic. Third, since it is "overall planning," we should not only see cooperatives, but also see mutual aid groups; not only see cooperatives and groups, but also combine the mutual aid and cooperation movement with production; not only see grain production increase, but also see the development of forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, and other undertakings: in this way, we can avoid being biased and make the leadership of rural work more comprehensive.

From the perspective of the broad masses of peasants, "overall planning" is to concretize the party's policies and the national plan to the masses. In the past, our plans for developing cooperatives were either too high or too low, but whether they were too high or too low, "left" or right, the masses could not "intervene" or "make suggestions." Therefore, although the leadership had a plan, the masses themselves still had a great deal of blindness. The "conservatism" and "rash advance" that we often check cannot be said to have nothing to do with this. If we do a good job in "overall planning," and add "strengthening leadership," we can combine the intentions of the leadership with the requirements of the broad masses, and enhance the consciousness of the mass movement. The same is true from the perspective of production planning. In the past few years, we have also formulated plans year after year, but these plans have never become the plans of the masses. Cooperatives and mutual aid groups also make production plans year after year, but they are not based on the national plan and have a great deal of blindness. In short, the leadership's plan is one thing, and the masses' plan is another; the leadership's plan has not really played a role in organizing and guiding production. Therefore, no matter how the county checks the completion of the plan every year, the masses always feel that it has nothing to do with them. With a comprehensive production plan that combines top-down and bottom-up, the plans of cooperatives can be preliminarily combined with the plans of the state, and the completion of the national plan has a foundation and a guarantee. At the same time, through the method of comprehensive planning centered on cooperativization, which is advocated by the leadership and supported by the masses, we can encourage the broad masses of peasants to build a new socialist life with more goals and more confidence.

Recently, the Keshan County Party Committee has reviewed the county's past planning work in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee on agricultural production cooperatives and the spirit of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee Rural Work Conference. It believes that although the past planning work has achieved some achievements, it is still far from meeting the new requirements of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee. Therefore, the County Party Committee has decided to conscientiously overcome the shortcomings in the past work on the basis of the original preliminary plan, and further implement the policy of "overall planning, strengthening leadership" to promote the mutual aid cooperation and agricultural production movement forward.

IV

Based on the past experience of Keshan County in promoting cooperative planning and production planning, the following issues should be paid attention to in further planning work:

First, the content of overall planning. Generally speaking, the main content should include mutual aid cooperation and agricultural production. These are two aspects of the same problem and cannot be mechanically separated. Because in planning mutual aid cooperation organizations, we cannot but study production issues; when carrying out production planning, we cannot but base it on mutual aid cooperation organizations. Of course, in terms of work steps, there must be a priority. The general rule is to first carry out the planning of mutual aid cooperation organizations, and then carry out production planning on the basis of the planning of mutual aid cooperation organizations. In areas where cooperativization has been completed, the main focus should be on doing a good job in production planning.

The content of mutual aid cooperation planning, according to the situation of villages in Keshan County having cooperatives, the current planning for mutual aid cooperation mainly arranges for the three types of peasant households who are preparing to expand old cooperatives, establish new cooperatives, and continue to run mutual aid groups. The issues that need to be resolved here are: 1. Is it necessary to specifically stipulate the time limit for non-member peasant households to join the cooperatives? It should be: after education, if they are willing to propose a time limit for joining the cooperatives, they can also stipulate it themselves, so that they have clear goals for struggle, but the leadership should not rigidly stipulate it. All those who want to continue to run mutual aid groups should be helped to do a good job in the mutual aid groups, create conditions, and be absorbed whenever they request to join the cooperatives. 2. Consider the overall situation of cooperatives and groups, and properly equip the backbone. We must both prevent the blind concentration of the backbone, and prevent the practice of randomly transferring party members to other places to serve as the backbone. 3. We should pay attention to the composition of members of cooperatives and groups to prevent problems such as "middle peasant cooperatives" and "landlord rich peasant groups." 4. We should pay attention to arranging the entry of old, weak, and disabled households into cooperatives and groups and production issues. 5. On the basis of the above work, we should help the branches study how to lead in the future, how old cooperatives should develop forward, how new cooperatives should be established, and how mutual aid groups should improve, so that the branches can proactively and comprehensively lead the cooperative movement forward.

The content of production planning. The experience of the past year proves that the key to carrying out production planning is to have clear content and specific requirements. Otherwise, it is either the same for everyone, or everyone does their own thing. The formulation of production content must also be tailored to local conditions. According to the situation in Keshan, the County Party Committee proposed that production planning should focus on the following: concentrate efforts to develop existing land fertility and increase yield per unit area; expand the area of wasteland reclamation as much as possible; use every ditch and spring to increase paddy fields; actively develop animal husbandry; develop forestry in a planned way; under the guidance of the national plan, vigorously increase the planting area of high-yield and stable-yield crops and reduce the planting area of low-yield crops; and allocate the planting area of soybeans and cash crops. These production contents do not have to be the same for every village and cooperative. It is necessary to grasp the key points according to different situations and ensure that every cooperative has new content for increasing production. However, we must adhere to the principle of agriculture as the main focus and diversified operations, and prevent the tendency of not paying attention to diversified operations, and prevent the tendency of neglecting to improve existing land fertility and expand cultivated land area. It is also necessary to adhere to the principle of being both advanced and feasible in carrying out production planning, and prevent the tendency of demanding too much and deviating from reality.

Second, the method of carrying out planning. To carry out overall planning, we must adopt the method of combining leadership with the masses. To achieve the combination of leadership and the masses, we must first do a good job in ideological mobilization within the party. Facts have proved that the process of carrying out overall planning is also the process of advanced ideas fighting against backward ideas, and correct ideas fighting against incorrect ideas, so we must grasp ideological leadership. For example, when Keshan studied production planning among county and district leaders this spring, it was found that some cadres lacked the idea of long-term construction and comprehensive development in agricultural production. For example, some district party committee secretaries did not pay attention to the long-term construction of a place and had the idea of ​​"temporary guests." Due to the lack of long-term construction ideas, their work was often "up and down," "maintaining the status quo," and "coping with the situation." Some comrades have more serious conservative ideas, lack a developmental perspective, and believe that "agricultural production is the same every year, and there is nothing new to play." Some district party committee secretaries believe that the county's production has development prospects, but their district has no development prospects, saying: "Insufficient cultivated land, barren land, few resources, and little potential." In response to the above ideas, the County Party Committee repeatedly carried out ideological education on long-term construction and comprehensive development, and criticized the ideas of "temporary guests" and "no development." When the village branch studied the plan, it also encountered some ideological problems, which were solved through methods such as convening party member meetings to study the instructions of the higher authorities and analyzing the situation of the village. Secondly, we must carry out propaganda and education work among the masses to improve the ideological understanding of the broad masses of members. The ideological problems existing among the members are: some members still consider the issue of increasing production in cooperatives from the perspective of mutual aid groups, and they feel that "joining the cooperatives is also production, and not joining the cooperatives is also production, and there is nothing to develop." A considerable number of members actively demand increased production, but they are struggling to find a way. The propaganda and education for the masses is generally carried out through the following methods: The first step is for the branch to make a resolution and then submit it to the People's Committee, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Representative Conference for discussion, and formulate a plan for implementing the resolution. The second step is to use the form of mutual aid cooperation representative meetings to discuss and approve the branch resolution, and then launch a discussion within the cooperative. Again, on the basis of extensive ideological education, we should formulate an overall planning program and specific measures to organize its realization in a way that is appropriate to local conditions and cooperatives. Experience has proved that where ideological education has been carried out and where the leadership method of proposing from top to bottom and launching discussions from bottom to top has been effectively grasped, the overall planning program has been done better and the results have been greater. Where ideological mobilization and cadre monopolization are neglected, formalism will inevitably arise.

Third, the issue of strengthening party leadership. Whether the planning program can be realized depends on strengthening party leadership. Carrying out overall planning is not "all is well," but it increases the responsibility of the leadership. "Overall planning" and "strengthening leadership" are unified and inseparable. Without the latter, the former is out of the question. After carrying out production planning, the Keshan County Party Committee first convened a representative meeting of advanced agricultural production cooperatives, and under the guidance and specific assistance of the Provincial Party Committee, concentrated on solving the problems in the operation and management of the cooperatives. It systematized the piecemeal experience of the past few years and further improved the production management level of the cooperatives. Secondly, before the spring plowing, the County Party Committee trained the technicians of the cooperatives, systematically summarized the experiences and lessons of increasing production technology, and formulated the technical measures for increasing production throughout the year. In each stage of production, attention was also paid to technical guidance. However, judging from the current inspection, the leadership of the county, district, and village party organizations in organizing the realization of the overall planning program is not strong enough, and there are still formalistic problems in the work. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the past, it is necessary to especially emphasize strengthening party leadership in the future.

    克山县贯彻执行“全面规划，加强领导”方针的初步体会
    中共黑龙江省克山县委书记  陈俊生
    黑龙江省克山县的合作化规划工作和以合作化为中心的生产规划工作，大体上是分两个阶段进行的。一九五四年春耕中至秋收后进行了合作化的“层层计划、常年准备，分批发展”的规划工作。一九五五年春耕前，合作社大批建成，即着重进行以合作化为中心的生产规划工作。这两个阶段的规划工作的大体经过是这样：
    一
    一九五三年冬到一九五四年春耕前，全县建立了一大批新社。当时最主要的问题是领导被动，群众摸不到领导意图。譬如不少区当时发生这样情形：区委原来认为全区可以建立十个社，结果支部报来十五个或二十个；而有时区委认为某村可以多建立几个社，可是一了解条件并不具备。县委从一九五三年秋到一九五四年春这一段中，对发展社的计划也曾经变了几次。当然，任何工作计划订出来以后，都不能一成不变，可是当时发展社的计划的变动是有些盲目的。例如第一次县委同各区委商定发展一百个社，不久各区降到八十个，以后又降到六十个。经过进行总路线的宣传和一系列工作，群众的社会主义积极性提高了，而领导仍用原来的眼光看问题，结果群众纷纷要求建社，领导陷于被动应付，计划层层被突破，最后建成的新社不是六十个，也不是一百个，而是三百五十个。在这种情形下，产生了不少毛病。一方面，由于事先缺乏准备，建社工作质量粗糙。如有的区曾一度使用过所谓“流水作业”的建社方法，就是哪里有要求建社的就临时派区干部到哪里去帮助，这个社建完，再有要求建社的又临时去“接上”。这样就造成了建社工作此起彼伏，领导应接不暇的局面。在这种情形下，自愿互利政策执行得不好，这是可以想像的。另一方面，有的领导人员在群众热情高涨的情形下，生怕“运动”过火了，就不分皂白地往下“压”，结果全县少数地方出现了“自发社”。此后，县委根据中央第二次农村工作会议和省委指示精神，在全县展开了“全面计划，常年准备，分批发展”的“报名挂号”工作。主要工作内容是：县、区都事先做出了发展社的计划指标（包括建立新社、扩大老社和建立互助组），村支部也都做了计划。支部的计划不是一般估计，而是经过一系列的宣传教育工作，在群众自愿要求“报名挂号”的基础上制定的。县、区计划又根据村支部计划作了修正。这样不但领导上心中有数，而且群众也摸到领导意图，“上下都有底了”。建社对象组大致确定后，区委和村支部首先调整和配备了社、组骨干力量，然后帮助建社对象组做了建社计划。对做好哪些建社准备工作，什么时候建立，怎样建立等等都进行了安排。为了使准备转社的互助组能“搞好生产、创造条件、争取建社”，全县成立了二百七十一个建社筹备委员会。有五百四十二个准备转社的互助组长被选为筹备委员会主任。后来他们中间的多数人被选为新社主任了。此外，区、村干部又帮助一般互助组安排了生产，有些互助组还提出了为建社创造条件的目标。经过如上一些工作，全县建社准备工作即大体上纳入了一个总体计划之内。但大批的社也不是一下子建成的，而是在规划基础上根据各社准备工作的不同情况“分批发展”的。到一九五四年秋收，全县建立新社工作大体告一段落。新建成的社四百二十个，入社农户占总农户的百分之五十二点三，加上原有社共八百四十七个，入社农户达总农户的百分之七十二点七。这批新社和一九五三年冬到一九五四年春建立的新社大不相同的是：准备工作时间较长；建社工作做得较细致；社员觉悟和生产积极性较高；领导骨干较强。从领导方面来看，基本上是有计划有准备地进行了建社工作，避免了被动现象。因此，全年建社计划完成得较早，新社对来年的生产准备的时间较充分。当然，工作中还是有缺点的。当时因为对“全面规划，加强领导”的方针还没有明确认识，工作还带有盲目性；党的阶级政策贯彻执行得还不够，表现在对老弱残废农民入社问题注意得不够；有强拉中农入社和不照顾中农利益的现象；少数地方未注意新社员成份，以至地主、富农钻入了合作社。
    二
    全县大批新社的建成，使农村的生产关系起了变化，生产能力也随之有了提高。根据全县大多数老社来看，一般情况是：男劳动力在互助组里一年劳动一百五十天左右，在合作社里劳动二百天以上，妇女参加劳动的人数比互助组有很大的增加；同时新农具比较大量的应用和耕畜、生产投资的增加等等。这样，合作社就需要有更多的内容，才能满足社员发展生产的要求。几年来我们在领导合作社的生产方面，虽然也做了不少工作，但由于对大批建立合作社以后生产力增长的新情况认识不足，因而所采取的措施远不能满足广大农民群众发展生产的要求。后来经省委启发，又学习了省委在双城县创造的以合作化为中心的全面规划经验，我们才在全县进行了以合作化为中心的生产规划工作。即根据新的生产能力增长的情况，制定全面的系统的增产措施，逐步地充实合作社的生产内容，使合作社能更多地增加生产。这样做的好处在于：使合作化运动同提高生产、合作社的生产和国家计划初步地结合起来了，并能鼓舞干部和农民完成计划、增加生产的信心。克山县进行生产规划后的初步效果，首先是扩大了高产稳产作物面积。全县今年玉米种植面积比去年增加了百分之一百一十八强。由于玉米的增加，低产作物的减少，估计全县可增产一万多吨粮食。其次是合作社今年春秋两季开荒三千八百一十九垧，达现有播种面积的百分之二点二（拖拉机站和国营农场给合作社移民开荒六千三百垧未计算在内）。估计新开荒地每垧最低可增产一吨粮食，全县仅合作社春秋两季开荒，即可增产三千八百多吨粮食。再次是合作社的水田面积比去年增加了百分之十一点六。仅古城农庄即新增加了一百垧水田，每垧估计可产七千斤，共可增产七十万斤。目前又有一百二十四个合作社计划开发水田，估计明年水田面积将比今年提高百分之二百四十七左右。此外，合作社的积肥面积一般可比去年增加百分之十左右；耕作技术有了改进，合作社查田补苗的地即有三千六百七十垧，这是过去少有的事情；合作社推广良种小麦一千六百零二垧，每垧可比一般小麦增产百分之八十以上。
    三
    前述情况表明，中央提出的在农村合作化运动中实行“全面规划，加强领导”的方针是完全正确的。我们感到执行这一方针的主要好处是充分体现了领导同群众相结合的领导方法。
    从县、区、村领导工作来看，如能认真地执行“全面规划，加强领导”这一方针，就可使自己的工作更加系统、全面和主动。这是因为：第一，实行“全面规划”可以把农村工作纳入总体计划之内，做到心中有数，可使领导立于全局之上来把握整个工作的进展，而不致处于应付局面。这样领导就主动了。第二，“全面规划”不但要计划今天的工作，还要计划明天的工作；不但要有临时性的措施，而且要有根本性的措施。因此领导方面大体上可以有步骤地进行工作，不致于零打碎敲，这样工作就更加系统化了。第三，既是“全面规划”，所以不但要看到合作社，而且要看到互助组；不但要看到社和组，而且要把互助合作运动和生产结合起来；不但要看到粮食增产而且要看到林业、水利、畜牧等事业的发展：这样就可以避免偏执一端，领导农村工作就更加全面了。
    从广大农民群众方面来讲，“全面规划”就是把党的政策和国家计划拿到群众中去具体化了。过去我们做发展社的计划，不是偏高就是偏低，但不论高了或低了，“左”了或右了，群众是“插不上手”、“提不上意见”的。因此，尽管领导有计划，群众本身还是有很大盲目性的。我们常常检查的“保守啦”、“冒进啦”，不能说同这没有关系。如果搞好了“全面规划”，再加上“加强领导”，就可以把领导意图同广大群众的要求结合起来，使群众运动增强了自觉性。从生产规划上看，也是这样。过去几年来，我们也是年复一年地制定计划，但是这种计划始终没变成群众的计划。合作社、互助组也年年订生产计划，但它们不是根据国家计划来订的，带有很大的盲目性。总之，领导上的计划是一回事，群众计划又是一回事；领导上计划没有真正起到组织和指导生产的作用。因此，不管县里年年检查计划完成得怎样，群众总是感觉不到跟他们有什么关系。有了自上而下和自下而上相结合的全面生产规划，就可以使合作社的计划和国家的计划初步地结合起来了，国家计划的完成也就有了基础、有了保证了。同时，通过领导提倡和群众赞助的以合作化为中心的全面规划的方法，就可以鼓舞广大农民更有目标、更有信心地来建设社会主义的新生活。
    克山县委最近根据党中央关于农业生产合作社问题的指示和黑龙江省委农村工作会议精神，对全县过去的规划工作作了检查。认为过去的规划工作虽然取得一些成就，但距中央和省委新的要求还相差很远。因此，县委决定在原来初步规划的基础上，认真克服过去工作中的缺点，进一步贯彻执行“全面规划、加强领导”的方针，以推动互助合作和农业生产运动前进。
    四
    根据克山县过去推行合作化规划和生产规划的经验，在进一步进行规划工作中，应注意以下几个问题：
    第一，关于全面规划的内容问题。一般地说，主要内容应包括互助合作和农业生产。这是一个问题的两方面，不能机械分开。因为在规划互助合作组织的同时，不能不研究生产问题；在进行生产规划的时候，又不能不以互助合作组织为基础。当然，在工作步骤上，是要有先有后的。一般规律是要首先进行互助合作组织的规划，然后再在互助合作组织规划的基础上进行生产规划。已经全部合作化的地方，主要应搞好生产规划。
    互助合作规划的内容问题，根据克山县村村有社的情况，当前对互助合作的规划，主要是安排好准备扩大老社的，成立新社的，继续办互助组的三种农户。这里需要解决的问题：一、是不是要具体规定未入社农户入社年限？应该是：经过教育后，如他们愿意提出入社年限也可以由他们自己规定，使他们奋斗目标明确，但是领导上不要硬性规定。凡是要继续办互助组的，都要帮助他们搞好互助组、创造条件，什么时候要求入社什么时候吸收。二、从社、组全盘考虑，适当配备骨干。既要防止骨干盲目集中，又要防止乱调党员到外地充当骨干的做法。三、要注意社、组成员的成份问题，防止造成“中农社”“地主富农组”等毛病。四、注意安排好老弱残废户的入社入组和生产问题。五、在上述工作基础上，要帮助支部研究今后如何领导，老社如何向前发展，新社如何建立，互助组如何提高等问题，使支部能够主动地全面地领导合作化运动向前发展。
    生产规划的内容问题。一年来的工作经验证明，进行生产规划，关键在于内容明确，要求具体。否则不是千篇一律，就是各搞一套。生产内容的规定又必须因地制宜。根据克山情况，县委提出生产规划应着重这几项：集中力量发挥现有地力，提高单位面积产量；尽一切可能扩大开荒面积；利用一沟一泉增加水田；积极发展牧畜业；有计划地发展林业；在国家计划指导下，大力增加高产稳产作物播种面积，压缩低产作物播种面积；分派种植大豆和经济作物播种面积。这些生产内容不是村村社社都得一样，需根据不同情况，抓住重点，做到社社都有增产新内容。但是必须坚持农业为主、多种经营的原则，既要防止不重视多种经营的偏向，又要防止忽视提高现有地力和扩大耕地面积的偏向。进行生产规划还必须掌握既先进又可行的原则，防止要求过高脱离实际的偏向。
    第二，关于进行规划的方法问题。进行全面规划必须采取领导同群众相结合的方法。要做到领导同群众相结合，首先必须在党内作好思想动员工作。事实证明，进行全面规划的过程，也就是先进思想同落后思想、正确思想同不正确思想进行斗争的过程，所以必须掌握思想领导。譬如今春克山在县、区领导人员中研究生产规划时，就发现有的干部对农业生产缺乏长远建设和全面发展的思想。如有的区委书记不重视一个地方的长远建设，有“临时作客”思想。由于缺乏长远建设思想，他们的工作经常是“上来下去”，“维持现状”，“应付局面”。有的同志存在着较严重的保守思想，缺乏发展观点，认为“农业生产，年年如此，没啥新玩艺”。有的区委书记认为全县生产有发展前途，但是本区没有发展前途，说：“耕地不足，土地瘠薄，资源很少，潜力不多”。县委针对上述思想，反复地进行了长远建设和全面发展的思想教育，批判了“临时作客”和“没啥发展”的思想。在村支部研究规划时，也遇到若干的思想问题，通过召开党员大会学习上级指示和分析本村情况等办法进行教育加以解决。其次，要在群众中开展宣传教育工作，提高广大社员的思想认识。社员中存在的思想问题是：一部分社员仍以互助组的观点来考虑合作社的增产问题，他们感到“入社也是生产，不入社也是生产，没啥发展的”。相当部分社员是积极要求增加生产的，但是他们苦于找不到办法。对群众的宣传教育，一般是通过这样的办法：第一步，支部做出决议，再提交人民委员会、青年团、妇女代表会等组织进行讨论，并制定执行决议的计划。第二步，运用互助合作代表会议形式，讨论通过支部决议，然后在社内展开讨论。再次，在广泛地进行了思想教育的基础上，即因地制宜、因社制宜地订出全面规划的方案和组织实现的具体措施。经验证明，凡是进行了思想教育，并能切实掌握自上而下提出、自下而上展开讨论的领导方法的，全面规划方案就做得都较好，收到效果也大。凡是忽视思想发动和干部包办的，必然产生形式主义。
    第三，关于加强党的领导问题。规划方案能否实现，关键在于加强党的领导。进行了全面规划，不是“万事大吉”了，而是加重了领导的责任。“全面规划”和“加强领导”是统一而不可分割的，没有后者，前者就无从谈起。克山县在进行了生产规划以后，县委首先召开了先进农业生产合作社代表会，在省委派人指导和具体帮助下，集中地解决了合作社经营管理上的问题。把几年来零碎的经验系统化了，进一步提高了合作社的生产管理水平。其次，县委在春耕前训练了合作社的技术员，系统地总结了增产技术上的经验教训，并制定了全年增产的技术措施。在各段生产中，又注意了技术指导。但从现在的检查来看，县、区、村党组织在组织实现全面规划方案上，领导还不够强，工作上还有着形式主义的毛病。为了克服过去的缺点，今后还要特别强调加强党的领导。
