    Combine the "Three Fixes" Work to Educate Farmers to Hand in Good Grain
    Lǐ Jiāquán

    The autumn grain purchase work of 1955 is about to begin in full swing. In order to ensure the quality of the grain purchased and stored, all regions should combine the "Three Fixes" work down to the household level to vigorously promote the handing in of good grain to farmers.

    The quality of grain purchased and stored is related to national construction and people's livelihood. If the quality of grain handed in by farmers is not good, it will not only easily cause pests, mold, and deterioration after the grain is stored, causing losses to the country, but also prevent urban and rural people from regularly obtaining good food. Therefore, vigorously promoting the handing in of good grain to farmers and ensuring the quality of stored grain is an important task.

    Last year, the quality of autumn grain purchased and stored in most areas met the national standards and improved compared to 1953. However, some areas also received a lot of substandard high-moisture and pest-infested grain. According to a survey of nineteen provinces and cities at the end of 1954, high-moisture grain accounted for 20 percent and pest-infested grain accounted for 30 percent. Heilongjiang Province spent 53,600 labor days to dry 268.8 million jin of high-moisture rice this spring, calculating an average of 5,000 jin dried per person per day. The average cost of drying was 20 yuan per 10,000 jin, totaling 536,000 yuan. The average weight reduction was 3 percent, resulting in a loss of 8.04 million jin of grain. If we add up the losses and expenses of drying high-moisture and pest-infested grain nationwide, this is a huge loss! In addition, we must also see that serious pest and mold deterioration accidents have occurred in some areas due to the poor quality of stored grain and the lack of timely treatment, and the losses in this regard are also significant.

    Why do national granaries receive large amounts of high-moisture and poor-quality grain? It should be admitted that objective reasons, such as late harvesting in some areas, climate imbalances, or other severe natural disasters, do have a significant impact on the quality of grain purchased and stored. However, in most areas, the main reason for the poor quality of grain purchased is the lack of widespread and in-depth education for farmers on handing in good grain. Some staff members believe that public grain should be handed in dry and clean, and that the purchased grain will be priced according to quality anyway, so it doesn't matter whether it's dried or not. Some staff members doubt whether asking farmers to hand in good grain is a "harsh demand" on farmers. Still other staff members believe that asking the masses to hand in good grain will affect the completion of the purchase task. Obviously, these ideas are incorrect. These comrades have not truly recognized the consistency of national interests and farmers' interests, and have not seen the huge losses that poor-quality stored grain brings to the country and the farmers themselves. Many facts show that as long as the education and mobilization work is done well, and the masses truly understand the benefits of handing in and selling good grain to the country and to themselves, they are willing to send dry and clean grain to the country. For example, during the autumn grain storage period last year, in Shuangshi District, Yongchuan County, Sichuan Province, due to repeated education of farmers, handing in good grain became a conscious action of the farmers. They generally "dried the grain three times and winnowed it twice" before handing it in, and most of the grain handed in met the national standards.

    When promoting the handing in of good grain to farmers, we must pay attention to explaining the reasons and explaining the advantages and disadvantages. You can explain to the farmers: if every 100 jin of grain handed in has one extra jin of moisture and impurities, and each household hands in 2,000 jin of grain, the seller will only receive two yuan more, but for these 2,000 jin of grain, the state has to turn over the mixed grain at the same time, which not only loses 20 jin of grain, but also costs a lot of drying expenses. This is the practice of sacrificing public interest for small gains. If farmers hand in good grain, not only can they get a higher selling price, but our socialist construction can also be strengthened. It must be explained to the farmers that it is relatively easy for each farmer to dry and clean the grain they should hand in; but if the poor quality grain is concentrated in storage, it will bring many difficulties and troubles to the national granaries and the farmers near the granaries in terms of grain sorting alone. For example, Qujing Prefecture, Yunnan Province, dried 170 million jin of high-moisture grain last year, and from January to September, as many as 100,000 farmers were mobilized to participate in the drying. Farmers blamed government staff, saying, "Why didn't you ask everyone to dry it clean when delivering the grain? Now you want us to dry it again, which wastes the country's money and takes up our time!" This fact shows that as long as farmers truly understand the principle that they should hand in good grain, they will surely realize the government's call to hand in good grain with practical actions.

    When promoting the handing in of good grain, we should adopt a variety of popular and easy-to-understand publicity and education methods according to local conditions. Before the autumn grain storage in Liaoning Province in 1954, a large number of propaganda posters were printed and distributed to farmers to introduce methods for handing in good grain. Kaiping County, Guangdong Province, drew materials on handing in good grain into pictures and held mobile exhibitions when farmers went to market. Some areas in Zhejiang Province brought grain moisture testers to the countryside, held grain sample exhibitions, taught farmers grain inspection techniques, and conducted propaganda and education on handing in good grain. These methods have achieved good results and can be promoted for reference in various places.

    While mobilizing farmers to hand in good grain, we must also be vigilant and crack down on the sabotage activities of class enemies. One of the means by which landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries in rural areas sabotage the state's grain work is to hand in damp and bad grain, and even mix ash, sand, stones, bricks, rotten fruits and flammable materials and other debris into the grain they hand in. They not only evade handing in grain themselves or hand in damp and bad grain, but also instigate some farmers with low awareness to do the same. Last autumn, Longling County, Yunnan Province, successively discovered that 15 kilograms of broken stones and five rotten eggs were buried in the grain handed in; Long Qianpei, a reactionary rich peasant in the fifth district of Tianzhu, Guizhou Province, put yellow matches in the millet in an attempt to burn down the state granary; and bad elements were also found in Lantian Third Village secretly placing sweet potatoes, oranges, etc. at the bottom of the grain baskets, in an attempt to pour them into the warehouse and cause the grain to rot. Therefore, in addition to granary staff raising their vigilance, strengthening protection, and doing a good job in grain inspection and grading during grain collection, we must also mobilize the vast number of farmers to keep their eyes open and resolutely smash the vicious conspiracies and sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who harm the country and the people.

    结合“三定”工作教育农民交售好粮
    李家泉
    一九五五年的秋粮征购工作即将全面开始，为了保证征购入库的粮食的质量，各地应该结合“三定”到户的工作，大力向农民宣传交售好粮。
    征购入库的粮食好坏，关系到国家建设和人民生活。如果农民交售的粮食质量不好，不仅粮食入库以后容易发生虫害、霉烂变质，使国家遭受损失，而且会使城乡人民不能经常得到好的食粮。因此，向农民大力宣传交售好粮，保证入库粮食的质量，是一项重要的任务。
    去年大部分地区秋季征购入库的粮食的质量符合国家规定的标准，并且较一九五三年有所提高。但是也有一些地区收进了不少不合标准的高水分粮和虫害粮。据一九五四年底十九个省、市的检查，高水分粮占百分之二十，虫害粮占百分之三十。黑龙江省今年春季整晒二亿六千八百万斤高水分稻谷，以平均每人每日整晒五千斤计算，共费五万三千六百个劳动日；平均每万斤整晒费用二十元，共付出五十三万六千元；平均降低分量百分之三，共损耗粮食八百零四万斤。如果把全国整晒高水分粮和虫害粮的损耗和费用加起来，这是一笔多么大的损失！此外，还要看到有些地区由于入库粮食的质量不好和处理不及时，发生严重的虫害和霉烂变质事故，这方面的损失也是很大的。
    为什么国家粮库会收进大量水分高和质量差的粮食呢？应该承认，有些地区收割晚期，气候失调，或其他自然灾害严重，这些客观原因确实对征购入库的粮食质量有很大影响。但是在绝大部分地区，征购的粮食质量不好的主要的原因，却是没有普遍、深入地向农民进行交售好粮的教育。有些工作人员认为：公粮要缴干缴净的，收购的粮食反正是依质论价，晒不晒不要紧。有的工作人员怀疑：要农民交售好粮，这是否是对农民的“苛求”？还有一些工作人员认为：要求群众交售好粮，会影响征购任务的完成。显然这些想法都是不对的。这些同志没有真正认识到国家利益和农民利益的一致性，没有看到入库粮食质量不好给国家和农民自己带来的巨大损失。许多事实说明：只要教育动员工作做得好，使群众真正懂得了交好粮、卖好粮对国家和对自己的好处，他们是愿意把粮食晒干扬净送给国家的。例如，在去年秋粮入库时期，四川省永川县双石区由于向农民进行反复的教育，交售好粮就变成农民的自觉行动，他们一般都把交售的粮食“晒三遍，风两遍”，交售的绝大部分粮食都符合国家规定的标准。
    在向农民宣传交售好粮的时候，必须注意讲清道理，说明利害。可以向农民算这样一笔账：如果每交一百斤粮食多一斤水分和杂质，每户交售二千斤粮食，交售者自己多收的钱也不过二元，但为这二千斤粮，国家就得把好坏混杂的粮食同时翻晒，这样国家不仅损失二十斤粮，而且还得花费很多整晒费用。这就是为小利而损大公的作法。如果农民交售好粮，不仅自己可以得到更高的售价，而且我们的社会主义建设也可以增强一分力量。要向农民说明：每个农户把自己应交售的粮食整晒干净，这是比较容易办到的事；可是如果质量不好的粮食集中入库以后，光是在整理粮食方面就会给国家粮库和粮库附近的农民带来许多困难和麻烦。例如云南省曲靖专区去年整晒高水分粮食一亿七千万斤，从一月到九月动员参加整晒的农民达十万人之多。农民责备政府工作人员说：“为什么送粮时不叫大家整晒干净，现在又要来翻晒，既浪费国家的钱，又占用我们的时间？”这个事实说明，只要农民真正懂得应该交售好粮的道理，他们就一定会以实际行动来实现政府交售好粮的号召的。
    在宣传交售好粮时，应该因地制宜地采取多种通俗易懂的宣传教育方式。辽宁省在一九五四年秋粮入库前，曾经印发大批宣传画，向农民介绍交售好粮的办法。广东省开平县把关于交售好粮的材料绘成图片，在农民赶集时举行流动展览。浙江省有些地区携带粮食水分测定器下乡，举行粮样展览会，向农民传授粮食验级技术，并进行交售好粮的宣传教育。这些办法都收到了良好的效果，各地可以参照推行。
    在动员农民交售好粮的同时，还必须警惕和打击阶级敌人的破坏活动。农村中的地主、富农和反革命分子破坏国家粮食工作的手段之一，就是交售潮粮、坏粮，甚至在交售的粮食里面掺放灰土、砂石、砖块以及腐烂水果和易燃物品等杂物。他们不但自己逃避交售粮食或交售潮粮坏粮，而且煽动一些觉悟低的农民也这样做。去年秋季云南省龙陵县曾先后发现交售的粮食内埋放进十五公斤碎石头和五个腐烂鸡蛋；贵州省天柱五区反动富农龙潜沛在谷子里面放进黄色火柴，企图烧毁国家粮库；蓝田三村也发现坏分子在送粮箩筐底暗放甘薯、橘子等，企图倒进仓内使粮食霉烂。因此，除了粮库工作人员在收粮时要提高警惕，严加防护，做好粮食的检查和验级工作外，我们还必须动员广大农民擦亮眼睛，坚决粉碎地主、富农和反革命分子这种祸害国家和人民的恶毒阴谋和破坏行为。
