Xinhua News Agency, Sinŭiju, October 13th. The vanguard division of the six divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteers returning home had completely withdrawn from Korea via the Sinŭiju rear port by the afternoon of the 12th.

The border city of Sinŭiju's train station in Korea has been filled with Koreans coming to see them off these past few days. Whenever a train carrying the returning Chinese People's Volunteers arrived at Sinŭiju Station, sustained applause and cheers would immediately erupt on the platform. Enthusiastic Koreans, playing trumpets and beating long drums, rushed into or to the doors of each train car to present flowers, shake hands, and embrace the CPV commanders and soldiers, and performed song and dance programs on the platform. Korean girls competed to board the trains to put honorary flowers on the CPV soldiers; children tied red scarves around the necks of the CPV soldiers; housewives, carrying large kettles of boiling water and holding cups, squeezed through the crowd to the train cars, delivering cups of hot water to the soldiers' hands. They said with deep affection, "Drink, this is Korean water!" Zhang Xinhua (transliteration), an octogenarian from Hepingli, Sinŭiju, and Jin Fengli (transliteration), a sixty-year-old woman whose family had eleven young men join the army, even danced Korean classical dances for the returning CPV soldiers in the train cars. Many soldiers, moved by this scene, expressed that they would work hard to defend the cause of peace in the future to repay the Korean people's love.

At a farewell rally, all the employees of the Sinŭiju Oil Production Cooperative also presented the returning CPV troops with a set of bronze Korean dining utensils. Jin Mingguan, a third-grade student from the Sixth People's School of Sinŭiju, also pinned his "Activist Badge" on the sleeve of a CPV soldier. Actors from the South Pyongan Province Provincial Art Theater also enthusiastically joined the ranks of those sending off the troops, singing Chinese songs to bid farewell to the CPV soldiers who were about to leave Korea.

    志愿军归国的先头部队一个师撤出朝鲜
    新华社新义州十三日电　中国人民志愿军归国部队六个师的先头部队一个师，到十二日下午止已全部经由新义州后方口岸撤出朝鲜。
    朝鲜国境城市新义州车站在这几天内整日聚集着前来送别的朝鲜人民。每当载着中国人民志愿军归国部队的列车驶进新义州车站，月台上就立刻响起经久不息的掌声和欢呼声。热情的朝鲜人民吹着喇叭，打着长鼓，涌到各个车厢里或车厢门口向志愿军指挥员、战斗员献花、握手、拥抱，并且在月台上演出歌舞节目。朝鲜姑娘们争着上车给志愿军归国部队的战士们戴光荣花；儿童们把红领巾系在志愿军战士的脖子上；家庭妇女们提着大开水壶，捧着水杯，从人群里挤到车厢跟前，把一杯杯开水送到战士的手里。她们情意深长地说：“喝吧，这是朝鲜的水！”新义州市和平里八十多岁的老大娘张信花（译音）和全家有十一个青年参军的六十岁的老大娘金凤礼（译音），还在车厢里为志愿军归国战士们跳起朝鲜古典舞来。许多战士在这种情景下激动地表示，要在今后努力保卫和平事业，答谢朝鲜人民的热爱。
    在一次欢送大会上，新义州市油脂生产合作社的全体职工还献给志愿军归国部队一套铜制的朝鲜饭具。新义州市第六人民学校三年级学生金明官也把自己的“积极分子章”挂在一位志愿军战士的衣袖上。平安南道道立艺术剧场的演员们，也热情地参加了欢送者的行列，他们高唱中国歌曲送别即将离朝的志愿军战士们。
