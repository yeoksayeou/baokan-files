Xinhua News Agency, October 29th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee concluded its discussion on the peaceful uses of atomic energy on October 27th.

The issue that caused the most debate during the discussion was the establishment of an international agency for the peaceful uses of atomic energy. U.S. Representative Pastore argued that the draft charter for the establishment of this agency should be drafted only by eight countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, and then these countries should invite other UN member states or members of specialized agencies to participate in the so-called final drafting meeting of the agency's charter. Pastore expressed opposition to allowing the United Nations organization and the General Assembly to participate in the drafting of the agency's charter and argued that the relationship between this agency and the United Nations should be equivalent to the relationship between the UN's specialized agencies and the United Nations. This means that the United States attempted to completely control the establishment of the international agency within a narrow group of countries led by the United States, thereby allowing them to enjoy a privileged position. At the same time, the United States also attempted to distance this agency from the United Nations as much as possible.

After the United States stated its position and submitted corresponding proposals with the United Kingdom and other countries, many national representatives expressed opposition. Soviet Representative Kuznetsov pointed out that, in the establishment of an international agency for the peaceful uses of atomic energy, the principle that no country or group of countries should be in a privileged position must be adhered to. This agency should not become a tool in the hands of any country or group of countries to exert political or economic pressure on other countries. Kuznetsov argued that the international agency should be established within the framework of the United Nations and suggested convening a meeting of experts from relevant countries to jointly study the issues arising from drafting the agency's charter. Kuznetsov suggested reaching an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons and argued that any country, even if it is not a member of the United Nations or a UN specialized agency, should be able to participate in this agency. Representatives from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, and Belarus also expressed similar opinions to the Soviet representative.

Many Asian, African, Latin American, and Nordic countries also expressed disagreement with the proposals of the United States, the United Kingdom, and others. These countries either emphasized that the international agency for the peaceful uses of atomic energy must be truly international, with large and small countries able to participate in the agency on an equal basis, or they opposed the principle of distancing the agency from the United Nations proposed by the United States, and instead favored establishing close relations between the international agency and the United Nations.

Due to the opposition, the U.S. representative had to make some amendments to the original proposal. The U.S. amendment first added to the preamble of the proposal, adding the sentence that the General Assembly believes that "atomic energy should be vigorously promoted for peaceful activities for the benefit of mankind and to improve the living conditions of mankind." In addition, the proposal also added a clause stipulating that the governments of Brazil, India, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia be invited as governments of relevant countries to participate in the negotiations on the establishment of an international agency for the peaceful uses of atomic energy and the drafting of the agency's charter, together with the governments of the eight countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. The substantive part of the proposal also added a clause stipulating that the aforementioned national governments should submit reports to the United Nations General Assembly. As for the relationship between this agency and the United Nations, the proposal stipulated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations should study it. However, the revised proposal still rejected the Soviet proposal, stipulating that only members of the United Nations or specialized agencies can participate in this agency.

The meeting of the Political Committee also discussed the issue of continuing to convene international scientific and technical conferences on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The proposal of the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries originally stipulated that such a conference would be held "in approximately three years," but was later amended to hold the conference within two or three years. U.S. Representative Pastore pointed out that this amendment was made based on a suggestion from the Soviet Union. However, the United States rejected the Soviet proposal that all countries should be able to participate in this international conference.

Xinhua News Agency, October 29th, New York Dispatch, according to TASS: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the joint proposal on the peaceful uses of atomic energy put forward by the United States, the United Kingdom, and some other countries by a majority of fifty-three votes on October 27th. No country voted against it during the vote, and six countries, including Syria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, abstained.

The resolution adopted by the committee stated that the United Nations General Assembly hopes to vigorously promote the use of atomic energy only for peaceful activities for the benefit of mankind and to improve human living conditions, and pointed out that lasting international cooperation is essential for the further development and expansion of the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The resolution expressed satisfaction with the work of the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy held in Geneva in August of this year and recommended that such a conference be held again within two or three years.

The resolution's section on the establishment of an international agency for the peaceful uses of atomic energy stipulated that all UN member states and members of specialized agencies should be invited to participate in the meeting to draft the final version of the agency's charter, and that the governments of Brazil, India, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia should be invited as governments of relevant countries to participate in the negotiations on drafting the charter of the international atomic energy agency, together with the governments of the countries that are already participating in the work of establishing the international atomic energy agency. The resolution recommended that the Secretary-General of the United Nations study the relationship between this agency and the United Nations and notify the relevant governments of the results before the convening of the meeting to draft the final version of the international agency's charter. The resolution stipulated that the relevant governments should submit reports to the United Nations General Assembly as needed.

    联大政委会关于和平利用原子能问题的讨论结束
    通过关于和平利用原子能的联合提案
    新华社二十九日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会二十七日结束了关于和平利用原子能问题的讨论。
    在讨论过程中引起争论最多的是关于建立和平利用原子能国际机构的问题。美国代表帕斯托主张关于建立这个机构的章程草案只应该由美、英、法等八个国家来草拟，然后再由这些国家邀请联合国其他会员国或专门机构的会员国参加所谓最后拟订机构章程的会议。帕斯托表示反对让联合国组织和大会来参加机构章程的制定工作，并且主张这个机构同联合国的关系相当于联合国各专门机构同联合国之间的关系。这就是说，美国企图把建立国际机构的工作完全把持在以美国为首的狭隘的国家集团手中，从而使它们享有特权地位。同时，美国还企图使这个机构尽量同联合国疏远。
    在美国表明了它的立场，并且同英国和其他一些国家提出了相应的提案以后，许多国家代表都表示反对。苏联代表库兹涅佐夫指出，在建立和平利用原子能国际机构的问题上，必须本着没有一个国家或者国家集团可以处于特权地位的原则。这个机构不应当成为任何国家或国家集团手中对其他国家施加政治或经济压力的工具。库兹涅佐夫主张国际机构应该建立在联合国范围内，并且建议召开一次有关国家的专家会议来共同研究由于拟订机构章程而产生的问题。库兹涅佐夫建议就禁止原子武器的问题达成协议，主张任何国家，即使它不是联合国或联合国专门机构的成员，都可以参加这个机构。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰和白俄罗斯的代表也发表了同苏联代表相似的意见。
    许多亚非国家、拉丁美洲国家和北欧国家也对美英等国的提案表示异议。这些国家或者是强调和平利用原子能国际机构必须是真正国际性的，大小国家都能够在平等的基础上参加这个机构；或者是反对美国提出的这个机构同联合国疏远的原则，而赞成国际机构同联合国建立密切关系。
    美国代表由于遭到反对，最后不得不对原提案提出了一些修正。美国的修正案首先对提案的序言作了补充，加上大会认为应该“大力促进原子能只用于为人类的和平活动服务和改善人类的生活条件”一句。此外，提案还补充了一条，规定邀请巴西、印度、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克政府作为有关国家的政府同美英等八个国家的政府一起参加关于建立和平利用原子能国际机构和拟订这一机构的章程的谈判。提案的实质部分也补充了这样一条，规定上述国家政府得向联合国大会提出报告。至于这个机构同联合国之间的关系，提案规定由联合国秘书长加以研究。但是修改后的提案仍然拒绝了苏联的建议，规定只有联合国或者专门机构的会员国才能参加这个机构。
    政治委员会的会议还讨论了继续召开和平利用原子能国际科学技术会议的问题。美英等国的提案原来规定“在大约三年内”再举行这种会议，后来修改为两年或三年之内举行这种会议。美国代表帕斯托指出，这种修改是根据苏联的建议提出的。但是美国却拒绝了苏联提出的关于所有国家都可以参加这个国际会议的建议。
    新华社二十九日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会二十七日以五十三票多数通过了美国、英国和其他一些国家提出的关于和平利用原子能问题的联合提案。在表决时没有一个国家投反对票，叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯、埃及、伊拉克、黎巴嫩和也门等六个国家弃权。
    委员会通过的决议表示联合国大会希望能够大力促进原子能只用于为人类的和平活动服务和改善人类的生活条件，并且指出持久的国际合作对进一步发展和扩大和平利用原子能是十分必要的。决议对今年八月间在日内瓦举行的和平利用原子能国际会议的工作表示满意，并且建议在两年或三年之内再举行这种会议。
    决议在关于建立和平利用原子能国际机构的部分规定邀请全体联合国会员国和专门机构会员国参加拟订这个机构的章程定本的会议，并且邀请巴西、印度、苏联和捷克斯洛伐克四国政府作为有关国家政府同现在已经参加建立原子能国际机构工作的各国政府一起参加关于拟订原子能国际机构的章程的谈判。决议建议由联合国秘书长研究这个机构同联合国的关系问题，并且把工作结果在拟订国际机构章程定本的会议召开以前通知有关政府。决议规定有关政府应该根据需要向联合国大会提出报告。
