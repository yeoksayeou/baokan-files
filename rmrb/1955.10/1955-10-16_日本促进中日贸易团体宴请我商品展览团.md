Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch: The entire Chinese Commodity Exhibition Delegation to Japan attended a welcoming reception on the afternoon of the 14th, co-sponsored by the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade.
    Mr. Shozo Murata, Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, said in his welcoming speech at the reception: This Chinese Commodity Exhibition is the largest commodity exhibition held in Japan by a foreign country. He said that although it is a commodity exhibition, it provides an understanding of China's economic achievements and is an important reference for the development of Sino-Japanese trade. We sincerely hope that this exhibition will be a success.
    Following this, Mr. Masanosuke Ikeda, representative and standing director of the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, said in his speech: China and Japan have not yet restored normal diplomatic relations. Today, China can hold such a large-scale commodity exhibition in Japan, which not only plays a role in promoting the development of Sino-Japanese trade, but is also meaningful for restoring diplomatic relations between China and Japan.
    Cao Zhongshu, head of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition Delegation, said in his speech that establishing normal trade relations between China and Japan and enhancing the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan are our common aspirations, and holding exhibitions mutually is a very good method. He expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, and all friendly organizations and people from all walks of life for their warm help and support.
