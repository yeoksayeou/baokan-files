    How the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant Improves Product Quality
    Cui Wenhong
    From November of last year to June of this year, with the help and guidance of two groups of Soviet experts, the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant systematically and comprehensively conducted technical training, began to organize production in a standardized manner, and thus significantly improved and ensured product quality.
    Last year, the quality of the plant's products was very poor. Not only did all three new product samples trial-produced that year fail to meet the standards, but also two old products that had been in production for two or three years were also substandard.
    The basic reason for the poor product quality was the continuation of the old methods and work styles of repair shops in trial production and production. When trial-producing new products, the three steps of sample trial manufacturing, small-batch trial production, and mass production were combined into one. One product had already produced 223 units, but the sample trial production had not yet been completed. The design of drawings, the preparation of tools and fixtures, and other work were chaotic, uncoordinated, and disconnected. Anyone could modify the drawings when the parts processing failed to meet the precision requirements or the purchased equipment did not meet the regulations, so that a correct set of drawings could not be found in the entire factory. One type of vertical drill had been in production for more than two years, but there was no process regulation; although the process regulations for some parts of a radial drilling machine were compiled, they were not implemented and were locked in a drawer. The factory also failed to establish and improve basic technical work. Most of the basic tools, measuring and testing instruments, and instruments were damaged to the point where they lost their precision, and the maintenance and upkeep of machine tools were extremely poor. Of the more than 100 foreign machine tools in the factory, only 15 met the installation standards, and most of them lost their original precision. The storage of materials was not numbered or marked, and the materials were not analyzed or tested, so the phenomenon of misusing and misapplying materials was extremely serious. The inspection procedures were incomplete, and the phenomenon of missed inspections and incorrect inspections was also very common.
    The continuation of the old work styles and methods from the repair period was even more serious in mass production. Sand molds were cast without being dried; castings were removed from the furnace before the tempering time was up; processing was sloppy, and assembly was a matter of cobbling things together; failure to comply with process discipline, knocking, hitting, hammering, and shimming with tinplate became the orthodox methods. Inspection was again a matter of perfunctory compliance, so the products manufactured in this way were bound to be "burned out and dysfunctional."
    There are certain ideological roots for the failure to overcome the old methods and work styles of the repair period. Generally speaking, the enterprise's leading staff, engineering and technical personnel, and management personnel neglected product quality, and their understanding of the serious political and economic significance of mastering new technologies was insufficient, and they lacked a comprehensive view of completing the plan and ensuring the supply of key construction projects. They did not understand that in the past, when doing repair work, because the tasks were not fixed and the equipment was incomplete, regular production could not be carried out, and many parts were "buckled" out by hand. If it was too big, it was filed, and if it was too small, it was shimmed; in manufacturing factories, this method and habit of production is not applicable. They did not understand that the trial production of new products is the key to training and improving the enterprise's technology and is a ladder for mastering new technologies. They regarded production technology preparation work and basic technical work as optional; they did not seek thorough understanding of Soviet technical documents and the process performance of new products. As early as 1953, users had continuously criticized the factory's low product quality. However, because many people only saw the past achievements and had won quality awards from the former Northeast Industrial Department, they believed that the users' "requirements were too high" and "the users probably don't know how to use our machine tools?" Therefore, the entire factory generally only sought quantity: at the end of the month, rushing to complete the output figures was praised, and exceeding the target was rewarded, but there were no penalties for defective products, and there were no quality indicators in the competition.
    Since November of last year, with the help and guidance of more than a dozen Soviet experts, the factory has systematically carried out trial production training and rework of old products, and has correspondingly established basic technical work.
    Under the specific help of experts, the factory focused on new products and supplemented old products, and started the new product trial production training work one by one, starting with products that were in high demand, had a good chance of success, and were relatively easy to produce. In each new product trial production training, the most basic and critical technical basic work of the enterprise was rectified, the preparation work for regular production technology was studied and carried out, so that the various links of production preparation work were connected and coordinated, and truly reached the quality and quantity requirements of each stage such as sample trial production, small-batch trial production, and mass production. Through the appraisal of sample trial production, the summary and appraisal of small-batch trial production, and then put into production, the past practice of not following the trial production regulations was changed. During the training, the factory, based on Soviet advanced experience and the current technical level of Chinese workers, corrected the original product design drawings that had errors, then revised the process regulations according to the corrected drawings, and prepared tools and fixtures according to the requirements of the revised process regulations. At the same time as carrying out these tasks, the construction of basic technical work was also started. For example, a large number of precision processing equipment were inspected and adjusted to make them suitable for the quality requirements of the products, the precision and rough processing equipment were strictly demarcated, workers were educated on equipment maintenance, the inspection organization was strengthened, the inspection methods were improved, raw materials and purchased parts were inspected, the quality of materials was clarified, and a metrology room and a gauge library were established to unify the factory's metrology management. This created favorable conditions for further establishing technical order.
    With the specific help of Soviet experts, the factory also solved many key technical problems in the trial production training, and began to replace the past backward repair production methods with advanced process methods. The main ones were learning new technical methods to solve long-standing problems such as oil leakage from the main shaft box, non-responsiveness of the clutch, excessive defective castings, and inspection methods of gauges; learning and comprehensively promoting new scraping methods, so that the scraping reached first-class accuracy, and the efficiency was increased by 40%; learning and mastering the adjustment methods of large planers and boring machines and the use methods of coordinate boring machines and screw grinding machines; and learning new inspection methods and metrology work. What is particularly important is that the factory's solution to key technical problems was not carried out in isolation, but together with the improvement of various basic technical work and the learning of new process methods, and was carried out on the basis of gradually establishing technical work. That is to say, to solve a quality problem, one must never only consider a certain point in it, dig into a dead end, but should pay attention to studying the internal connections of the relevant aspects of a quality problem, find the crux of the problem, and prescribe the right medicine.
    With the help of Soviet experts, the factory also considered the preparation of production technology more seriously, arranged the trial production work of each product more formally, and conducted the verification and appraisal work of each stage seriously. Because the factory's leading staff have begun to realize that mastering new technologies must also establish and improve organizational systems, implement process discipline, and strengthen the three-level and one-chief system and various work responsibility systems, organizational adjustments were made, the design, process, tooling, and inspection technical departments were strengthened, and the experience of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant in organizing design was begun to be learned and implemented. After doing this, the confidence of the workshop workers in improving product quality was greatly improved. The workers have been able to act according to the drawings, and the situation of poor quality has been greatly reduced.
    Due to the lack of an overall plan in the factory, the failure to have a clear understanding of the workload for a long time, the lack of an overall arrangement for all new products, the poor coordination of the operation plan, and the failure to form a conscious action in the entire factory to implement the experts' recommendations, the new achievements achieved in the quality of many products are not yet very consolidated. However, due to the above-mentioned tasks, the product quality has been significantly improved. In terms of old products, by April of this year, more than 300 vertical drills in stock had been completely disassembled and repaired. In terms of new product trial production, the sample trial production training and small-batch trial production appraisal of one type of vertical drill were completed in April, and mass production was started in June; the sample trial production training of another type of vertical drill was completed in June, the small-batch trial production training was completed in July, and mass production was started in August. These new and old products are qualified in terms of geometric accuracy, product parts manufacturing, and the appearance of the product. In the past, the products often deformed as soon as they entered the warehouse, stalled during heavy cutting, and the performance could not meet the requirements; the products now produced have overcome the past shortcomings and can guarantee the user's normal use for one year to one and a half years without changing the accuracy.
    Due to the fundamental improvement in product quality, the scrap rate has been correspondingly reduced. In the first half of this year, the factory's processing scrap rate was reduced by an average of 3.1% compared with last year, and the foundry scrap rate was reduced by 20.94%. More importantly, due to the relatively stable product quality, and the establishment of systems such as work shift plans, parts matching instruction charts, and inspector duty reports with the help of experts, the potential of production was quickly promoted, and the output of machine tools increased month by month.
    The experience of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant shows that to improve and ensure the quality of mechanical industrial products and ensure the completion of new product trial production tasks, it is necessary to overcome the old methods and work styles of repair and carry out regular production. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to conduct technical training seriously and correctly: first, concentrate efforts on mastering the technical quality of new products, overcome the shortcomings in past trial production, and rectify the organizational system to establish a regular work style. Doing so not only establishes a reliable and solid foundation for the growth of new products, but also drives the old products to improve in technology and quality, and takes measures to gradually improve the quality of old products on the basis of eliminating violations of process discipline. In this work, we should prevent the deviation of failing to grasp the central link of new products, or "starting from scratch" on old products and wasting too much effort unnecessarily. Second, technical training should be carried out step by step, the preparation of technical work and basic technical work should be rectified seriously, and active measures should be taken to study and solve key technical problems. In this regard, it is necessary to fight against conservative tendencies and actively implement technical standards; it is also necessary to prevent the deviation of blindly and one-sidedly pursuing higher standards. The quality of the product should be guaranteed to be: precise where it should be precise, and rough where it should be rough, just right, so as to meet the principles of economic accounting and increase production and economize.

    沈阳第二机床厂是怎样改善产品质量的
    崔文洪
    从去年十一月到今年六月，沈阳第二机床厂曾在两组苏联专家的帮助和指导下，较全面较系统地进行了技术补课，开始正规地组织生产，因而显著地改进和保证了产品质量。
    去年这个厂的产品质量是很不好的。不只是当年试制的三种新产品样品全部不合格，就是生产二、三年之久的两种老产品，也不合格。
    产品质量不好的基本原因是在试制和生产中因袭过去修配厂的旧方法和旧作风。试制新产品时，把样品试造、小批试制和成批生产三个步骤并做一步。有一种产品已生产了二百二十三台，但样品试制还未完成。图纸设计、工卡具的准备等工作杂乱无章，互不配合、衔接。零件加工达不到精度要求和购买的器材不合规定时，谁都可以修改图纸，以致全厂找不出一套正确的图纸。有一种立钻已生产了两年多，但没有工艺规程；有一种摇臂钻床的部分零件的工艺规程虽然编出来了，但没有贯彻执行，被锁在抽屉里。这个厂也不建立和健全技术基础工作。绝大部分的基本工具、量检具、仪器损坏到失去了精度，对机床的维护、保养极差，全厂一百多台国外机床中，只有十五台是合乎安装标准的，绝大部分都失去了原有的精度。材料的保管没有排号和标记，对材料没有分析和化验，所以错用、乱用现象极其严重。检查规程不完备，漏检、错检的现象也很普遍。
    在大批生产中因袭修配时期的旧作风、旧方法更为严重。砂型不干就铸造；铸件焖火不到时间就由炉中抽出；加工是马马虎虎的，装配是凑凑付付的；不遵守工艺纪律，敲、打、捶、掂、捻，垫上洋铁片等成为正宗办法。而检查又是迁就应付，这样制造的产品就难免“焦头烂额，全身失灵”了。
    修配时期的旧方法、旧作风之所以不能克服，是有一定的思想根源的。总的来说，就是企业领导工作人员、工程技术人员和管理人员，忽视产品质量，对掌握新技术的严重政治意义和经济意义认识不足，缺乏全面完成计划和保证重点建设供应的观点。他们不了解，过去干修配活时，因为任务不固定，设备不全，不能进行正规的生产，许多配件都是用手工“扣”出来的，大了就锉，小了就垫；在制造的工厂里，这种生产的方法、习惯是不适用的。他们不了解新产品的试制是锻炼和提高企业技术的关键，是掌握新技术的阶梯。他们把生产技术准备工作和技术基础工作看做可多可少、可有可无的；对于苏联技术资料文件和新产品工艺性能不求甚解。早在一九五三年，用户就不断地批评这个厂的产品质量低劣。但由于有不少人只看到过去有所成就和曾得过前东北工业部的质量奖励，就认为用户的“要求太高了”、“用户不会使用我们的机床吧？”因此，全厂就普遍地只求数量：月末突击完成产量数字受表扬，超额了有奖，但出了废品不罚，竞赛没有质量指标。
    从去年十一月起，这个厂在十几位苏联专家的帮助和指导之下，有步骤地展开了试制补课和老产品返修工作，相应地建立起技术基础工作。
    在专家的具体帮助下，这个厂以新产品为主老产品为辅，从需要多的、有把握的、较容易生产的产品开始，一个个地进行新产品试制补课工作。在每个新产品试制补课中，着手整顿企业最基本最关键的各项技术基础工作，学习和进行正规的生产技术准备工作，使生产准备工作的各个环节衔接配合，真正达到样品试制、小批试制和成批生产等每个阶段所必须的质量和数量的要求，并通过鉴定样品试制，经过总结和鉴定小批试制，再投入生产，转变了过去不按试制规程办事的作风。在进行补课时，工厂根据苏联先进经验和我国工人当前的技术水平，改正原来有错误的产品设计图纸，然后根据改正的图纸修正工艺规程，根据修正的工艺规程的要求准备工卡具。在进行这些工作的同时，又着手进行了技术基础工作的建设。如检查、调整了大批精加工设备，使之适合于产品质量的要求，严格划清了精、粗加工设备，向工人进行了设备保养的教育；充实了检查组织，改进了检查方法，检查原材料、外购件，分清了材料质量，成立了计量室和检具库，统一了全厂计量管理。这就为进一步建立技术秩序创造了良好条件。
    这个厂还在苏联专家的具体帮助之下，在试制补课中解决了很多技术关键问题，并开始以先进的工艺方法代替过去落后的修配的生产方法。其中主要的是学习新技术方法，解决了主轴箱体漏油、结合子不灵、铸件废品过多、检具检查方法等长期存在的问题；学习和全面推广了新的刮研方法，使刮研达到了一级精度，效率提高了百分之四十；学习和掌握了大刨床、镗床的调整方法和座标镗床、螺丝磨床的使用方法；学习了新的检查方法和计量工作。尤其重要的是，这个厂解决技术关键问题不是孤立地进行的，而是同改进各项技术基础工作和学习新的工艺方法一起进行的，是在逐步建立技术工作的基础上进行的。也就是说，解决一个质量问题，绝不能只考虑其中的某一点，钻牛角尖，而应注意研究一个质量问题的有关方面的内部联系，找出症结，对症下药。
    在苏联专家的帮助下，这个厂也比较认真地考虑了生产技术准备工作，较正规地安排了每个产品试制工作，严肃地进行了每一阶段的验证和鉴定工作。由于工厂的领导工作人员已开始认识到掌握新技术还必须建立和健全组织制度，贯彻工艺纪律，加强三级一长制和各项工作责任制，所以进行了组织调整，加强了设计、工艺、工具、检查各个技术部门，并开始学习和贯彻沈阳第一机床厂组织设计的经验。这样做以后，就大大提高了车间工人提高产品质量的信心。工人们已能做到按图纸办事，质量低劣的情况已大为减少了。
    由于全厂缺乏总体计划，由于长期未摸清工作量而缺乏对全部新产品作总的安排，由于作业计划衔接不好，由于贯彻执行专家建议还没有在全厂内形成自觉的行动，许多产品质量所达到的新成就还不很巩固。但是，由于进行了以上各项工作，产品质量已有显著的提高。在老产品方面，到今年四月，已将库存的三百多台立钻全部重新拆修完毕。在新产品试制方面，有一种立钻的样品试制补课和小批试制鉴定，已于四月完成，六月转入大批生产；另一种立钻的样品试制补课已于六月份完成，小批试制补课已于七月完成，八月份开始成批生产。这些新产品和旧产品，无论在几何精度和产品零件制造方面，以及在商品的外观方面，都是合格的。过去出产的产品往往一入库就变形，重切削就闷车，性能达不到要求；现在出产的产品已能克服过去的缺点，并可保证用户正常地使用一年以至一年半而精度不变。
    由于从根本上改进产品质量，相应地使废品率也有所降低。今年上半年全厂加工废品率比去年平均减少百分之三点一，铸工减少百分之二十点九四。更重要的是由于产品质量比较稳定，以及在专家帮助下建立了工作班计划、零件配套指示图表、检查员值班报告等制度，很快地促进了生产潜力的发挥，使机床产量逐月上升。
    沈阳第二机床厂的经验说明，要改进和保证机械工业产品的质量，保证新产品试制任务的完成，必须克服修配的旧方法和旧作风，进行正规生产。而要达到这样的目的，必须认真正确地进行技术补课：首先集中力量于掌握新产品的技术质量，克服过去试制中的缺点，并在组织制度上加以整顿，树立起正规的作风。这样做，不仅给新产品的增长建立起可靠和稳固的基础，并且可以带动老产品在技术和质量上有所改进，在消灭违反工艺纪律的基础上，采取措施，把老产品的质量逐步提高。在这项工作中，应该防止抓不住新产品这一中心环节，或在老产品上“从头做起”的无谓地过多耗费力量的偏向。其次，技术补课应有步骤地进行，要认真整顿技术准备工作和技术基础工作，并要积极采取措施研究和解决关键技术问题。在这方面，既要向保守倾向作斗争，积极实现技术标准；也要防止盲目片面追求提高标准的偏向。产品质量应保证做到：应精者精、应粗者粗，恰如其分，以符合经济核算和增产节约原则。
