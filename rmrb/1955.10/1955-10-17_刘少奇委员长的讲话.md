Friends of the Japanese Diet Delegation:

    On behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, I express my sincere gratitude and warm welcome to all of you for accepting our invitation to attend our country's sixth anniversary National Day celebrations, and for paying friendly visits to various parts of our country after the celebrations. Now, as you, my friends, are about to leave our country and return to Japan, I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words as a send-off.

    This is the first time that the Japanese Diet has accepted the invitation of the Standing Committee of our National People's Congress to send a delegation to our country. I believe that this is of constructive significance, and it will set a good precedent for future mutual visits by delegations from the Chinese and Japanese parliaments.

    China and Japan are close neighbors with a long history of peaceful coexistence and mutual friendship. Although Sino-Japanese relations have been unpleasant in recent years, that is a thing of the past. As Chairman Mao Zedong said, since the end of World War II, the international situation has undergone great changes, and the positions of China and Japan have also undergone fundamental changes. Now the United States has invaded our territory of Taiwan, and Japan has not yet completely shaken off the American occupation. Both China and Japan are being invaded. In this sense, our situations have certain similarities. Therefore, the feelings of the Chinese people towards Japan have also changed. The Chinese people sincerely sympathize with the efforts of the Japanese people to completely get rid of foreign occupation and achieve complete independence of their motherland.

    We hope that our neighbor, Japan, will soon become an independent, peaceful, prosperous, and strong Japan. We believe that Japan, which has national self-esteem and has always existed as a great independent country, will certainly be able to completely get rid of the difficult position it has been in since World War II. We are willing to establish normal relations with our neighbor, Japan, as soon as possible. We are willing to implement the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence on this basis, in order to consolidate and develop our friendly relations. This will guarantee peace in the Far East and consolidate world peace.

    I am very pleased that you, my friends, share the same view as us. That is, in order to restore diplomatic relations between our two countries, efforts should be made to promote the early realization of diplomatic negotiations between the governments of China and Japan. There are many issues between China and Japan that have not been resolved because normal relations between China and Japan have not been established. As long as the issue of normal relations between China and Japan can be resolved, many other issues will be gradually resolved.

    However, this does not mean that other issues between China and Japan should be put aside before the issue of normalization of Sino-Japanese relations is resolved. No, that is definitely not what I mean. On the contrary, we should continue to carry out more various exchanges between China and Japan, whether they are parliamentary delegations, people's organizations, trade, or cultural and artistic exchanges, in order to enhance mutual understanding between the people of the two countries through these exchanges and promote the early realization of the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.

    I know that you are all enthusiastic about Sino-Japanese friendship and are willing to see the early restoration of normal relations between China and Japan. As long as we have the determination and this sincere desire, I believe that we can overcome any obstacles and difficulties and achieve our common goal as soon as possible, because this is the common wish of the people of China and Japan.

    I thank you all for coming to visit our country from afar. I propose a toast to a smooth journey home for all of you, to your good health, to the growing friendship between the people of China and Japan, and to the early establishment of normal relations between China and Japan.

    Cheers!

    刘少奇委员长的讲话日本国会议员访华团的各位朋友们：
    我代表中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会，对于各位应邀来参加我国六周年的国庆典礼，并且在观礼以后前往我国各地进行了友好的访问一事，表示诚挚的感谢和热烈的欢迎。现在，当着各位朋友们即将离开我国返回日本的时候，我趁这个送别的机会，说几句话。
    日本国会接受我全国人民代表大会常务委员会的邀请，派遣代表团前来我国，这还是第一次。我认为这是具有建设性的意义的，它将给今后中日两国议会代表团的互相访问，树立良好的开端。
    中日两国是近邻，有着很长久的和平相处和相互友好的历史。虽然在最近若干年以来的中日关系是不愉快的，但是这已经是过去了的事情。正如毛泽东主席所说的一样，自从第二次世界大战结束以后，国际情况已经有了很大的变化，中日两国所处的地位也已经有了根本的变化。现在美国侵占了我国的领土台湾，而日本至今也还没有完全摆脱美国的占领状态，我们中日两国同样是被人侵略的。在这种意义上说，我们的处境在这一点上是有某些相似的。因此，我们中国人民对于日本的感情也就发生了变化。中国人民对于日本人民为完全摆脱外国的占领状态和祖国的完全独立所作的努力，是衷心地同情的。
    我们是盼望着我们的近邻日本，能够早日成为一个独立、和平、富强、繁荣的日本。我们相信具有民族自尊心、历来作为一个伟大的独立国家而存在的日本，是一定能够完全摆脱在第二次世界大战以后所处的那种困难的地位的。我们愿意同我们的邻国日本早日建立正常关系，我们愿意在这样的基础上，实行互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处的五项原则，以巩固和发展我们相互间的友好关系。这将使远东和平获得保证，使世界和平也获得巩固。
    我很高兴各位朋友们都有一种同我们一致的看法。这就是为着我们两国邦交的恢复，应该努力促进中日两国政府间的外交谈判早日实现。现在中日两国间有很多问题未能获得解决，原因就是中日两国间的正常关系未能建立。只要中日两国间正常关系问题能够解决，其他许多问题，都会逐步地获得解决。
    不过这并不是说，在中日关系正常化这一问题尚未获得解决以前，中日间的其他问题就都搁置下来。不是的，我的意思决不是这样。相反的，我们应当使中日两国间的各种来往，不论是议会代表团的，人民团体的，贸易的，文化艺术的各种来往活动，都应当继续地更多地进行，以便经过这些来往，增进两国人民的相互了解，促进中日两国关系正常化的早日实现。
    我知道诸位都是热心于中日友好的，都是愿意早日看到中日两国恢复正常关系的。只要我们有决心，有这一真诚的愿望，我相信一定可以克服任何障碍和困难，使我们的共同目的能够早日实现，因为这是中日两国人民的共同愿望。
    我感谢各位的远道前来访问我国，我建议，为着祝贺各位归途一路顺利，祝贺各位身体健康，祝贺中日两国人民的友谊日益增进，祝贺中日两国正常关系的早日建立。
    干杯！
