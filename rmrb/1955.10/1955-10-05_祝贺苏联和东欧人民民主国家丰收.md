    Congratulations on the Bumper Harvest of the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democratic Countries
    As the harvest season arrives, good news of bumper grain harvests from the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries keep pouring in. Ukraine, North Caucasus, and the Volga River region, the main grain-producing areas of the Soviet Union, have all reported bumper harvests, and the country's grain harvest is generally good; many advanced agricultural areas have greatly increased grain production and have completed and overfulfilled the state's grain purchase plan ahead of schedule. Poland and Czechoslovakia have achieved their biggest harvest in more than a decade. Romania has had a national bumper harvest, with many regions achieving high yields of wheat and barley, and corn is also expected to have its largest harvest in the past two decades. Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania have also had good harvests this year.
    The bumper harvest is a joyous event for the entire socialist camp.
    The good climate is one reason for the bumper harvest achieved by the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries this year, but there are more important factors that only exist in socialist countries. The issue of agricultural production, which is related to people's food and industrial development, is receiving great attention from the Communist and Workers' Parties and the governments in these countries, and the rapidly developing socialist industry is providing increasingly strong support to agriculture. In addition, there is the high labor enthusiasm of the liberated farmers and youth – the bumper harvest is achieved on this basis.
    During World War II, the agriculture of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries suffered severe damage. After the war, the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union took measures to rapidly restore and further develop agriculture, so that the Soviet Union's grain production recovered to the pre-war level in the third year after the war, and in the following years grain production continued to increase. By 1953, agricultural production in the Eastern European people's democratic countries had also recovered to the pre-war level. In order to accelerate the development of agriculture, to meet the needs of large-scale socialist industrial construction and to further improve the people's living standards, the September 1953 plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union adopted the "Resolution on Measures for Further Development of Soviet Agriculture," and the February-March 1954 plenary session adopted the "Resolution on Further Expanding Grain Production in the Soviet Union and on Reclaiming Virgin and Fallow Land." The January plenary session of this year also proposed the task of further developing grain production and increasing the annual grain output to at least 10 billion poods by 1960. Since the second half of 1953, the Eastern European people's democratic countries have also successively adopted a series of measures to develop agriculture, including adjusting the imbalance in industrial and agricultural development, increasing state investment in agriculture, reclaiming wasteland, improving cultivation, increasing grain yield per unit area, improving the work of agricultural machinery stations and state farms, further developing and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives, and increasing assistance to farmers.
    The important measures taken by the parties and governments of the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries have led to the rapid development of agricultural production in these countries, especially a significant increase in grain production. From the spring of 1954 to the present, the Soviet Union has reclaimed 29 million hectares of virgin and fallow land, and has sown seeds on 20 million hectares of it. Large-scale land reclamation has proven to be an excellent way to increase production. Although the climatic conditions in some grain-producing areas of the Soviet Union were not good last year, the total grain harvest of the Soviet Union and the amount of grain purchased and acquired were still higher than in 1953. The grain sowing area in the Eastern European people's democratic countries has also generally increased, and the total grain harvest of these countries in 1954 was also mostly higher than in 1953.
    The characteristic of economic development in socialist countries is to further develop agriculture and light industry on the basis of vigorously developing heavy industry. The strong development of heavy industry in the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries has provided these countries' agriculture with a large number of machines. As of July 1, 1955, the number of tractors in Soviet agriculture reached more than 1.4 million (each calculated at 15 horsepower), and the number of grain harvesting combines reached 350,000. The number of machine tractor stations and tractors acquired in agriculture in the Eastern European people's democratic countries is also rapidly increasing. The continuous strengthening of mechanized farming has promoted the great development of agricultural production in these countries. The use of a large number of combine harvesters, threshers and other agricultural machines ensures that crops are harvested and threshed at the fastest speed, reducing the loss of bumper grain.
    The working people of the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries have carried out enthusiastic labor to implement the various measures of the Party and the government to further develop agriculture. More than 200,000 working people and young people in the Soviet Union have responded to the call of the Party and the government and actively participated in the work of reclaiming wasteland; 16,000 young people in Czechoslovakia have also participated in the work of reclaiming wasteland in border areas. Farmers use various methods such as improving soil, deep plowing and fine cultivation, and using advanced agricultural technologies to increase grain yield per unit area. In the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, developing agricultural production is not only a matter for farmers, but a national undertaking. Workers strive to provide agriculture with extra machines, personnel in trade and transportation systems arrange to supply rural areas with more supplies, scientific workers work hard to study methods to improve agriculture, and literary and art workers inspire farmers' labor with their works. Everyone is working towards one goal: to strive for a bumper harvest and create a happy life.
    The bumper grain harvest in the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries shows that the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system. The Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries plan to expand cultivated land and continuously improve agricultural production, increasing the supply of food, feed and industrial raw materials; while the United States has been plagued by the crisis of agricultural product "surplus" for years, drastically reducing cultivated land area, causing a large number of small and medium-sized farmers to go bankrupt, while the working people cannot get enough food. The bumper grain harvest in the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries also powerfully demonstrates the growing economic strength of the socialist camp.
    The Chinese people, who are celebrating the bumper harvest, joyfully congratulate the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries on their bumper grain harvest, believing that this is extremely important for strengthening the socialist camp and consolidating the cause of world peace.

### 祝贺苏联和东欧人民民主国家丰收

    祝贺苏联和东欧人民民主国家丰收
    当收获季节来临的时候，苏联和东欧人民民主国家谷物丰收的喜讯纷纷传来。苏联主要产粮区乌克兰、北高加索和伏尔加河流域都告丰收，全国谷物收成普遍良好；许多先进农产区大大提高了谷物产量，提前并超额完成了国家的谷物征购计划。波兰和捷克斯洛伐克获得了十多年来最大的丰收。罗马尼亚全国丰收，许多地区的小麦和大麦都获得了高额产量，玉蜀黍也将得到过去二十年来未曾有过的大丰收。匈牙利、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚今年收成也很好。
    丰收，这是整个社会主义阵营的喜事。
    今年苏联和东欧人民民主国家获得这样的丰收，气候良好是一个原因，但是还有更重要的、只有在社会主义的国家里才有的因素。关系民食和工业发展的农业生产问题在这里得到共产党和工人党以及政府的极大关怀，迅速发展的社会主义工业对农业提供了日益强大的支持，加上获得了解放的农民和青年的高昂的劳动热情——丰收是在这样的基础上取得的。
    在第二次世界大战期间，苏联和东欧国家的农业曾经遭受了严重的破坏。战后苏联共产党和政府采取了迅速恢复和进一步发展农业的措施，使苏联的谷物生产在战后第三年就恢复到战前水平，而在随后几年中谷物产量继续增加。东欧人民民主国家农业生产到一九五三年也都恢复到战前水平。为了使农业加速发展，以适应大规模社会主义工业建设的需要和进一步提高人民生活水平，苏联共产党中央委员会一九五三年九月全体会议通过了“关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施的决议”，一九五四年二—三月全会通过了“关于进一步扩大苏联的谷物生产和关于开垦生荒地和熟荒地的决议”，今年一月全会又提出进一步发展谷物生产，使谷物年产量在一九六○年达到至少一百亿普特的水平的任务。从一九五三年下半年起，东欧人民民主国家也相继采取了一系列的发展农业的措施，这些措施包括调整工农业发展不平衡的现象，增加国家对农业的投资，开垦荒地，改善耕作，增加单位面积谷物产量，改进农业机器站和国营农场的工作，进一步发展和巩固农业生产合作社并增加对农民的帮助等等。
    苏联和东欧人民民主国家的党和政府所采取的这些重要措施，使这些国家的农业生产迅速发展，特别是谷物生产大大增加。从一九五四年春季到目前为止，苏联已经开垦了两千九百万公顷生荒地和熟荒地，并在其中两千万公顷的土地上播了种。大规模垦荒已证明是一个极好的增产办法，虽然去年苏联一些产粮区的气候条件不好，但是苏联全国的谷物总收获量以及谷物的征购和收购量还是比一九五三年为高。东欧人民民主国家的谷物播种面积也普遍地增加了，一九五四年这些国家的谷物总收获量也大都高于一九五三年。
    社会主义国家经济发展的特点，是在大力发展重工业的基础上来进一步发展农业和轻工业。苏联和东欧人民民主国家重工业的强大发展，使这些国家的农业获得了大量的机械。到一九五五年七月一日止，苏联农业中拖拉机的数目已达一百四十多万台（每台以十五马力计算），谷物收割联合机的数目已达三十五万台。东欧人民民主国家机器拖拉机站和农业中所获的拖拉机的数目也在迅速增加。机械化耕作的不断加强，推动了这些国家农业生产的大步发展。大量的联合收割机、打谷机和其他农业机器的运用，保证了作物以最快的速度收割和打好，减少了丰产谷物的损失。
    苏联和东欧人民民主国家的劳动人民为实现党和政府进一步发展农业的各项措施而进行了热情的劳动。苏联已有二十万以上的劳动人民和青年响应党和政府的号召积极参加了开垦荒地工作；捷克斯洛伐克也有一万六千名青年参加了边境地区的开荒工作。农民们用改良土壤、深耕细作、运用先进的农业技术等各种方法，提高单位面积的谷物产量。在苏联和人民民主国家中，发展农业生产不仅是农民的事，而是一桩全民的事业。工人们争取额外供给农业以机器，贸易和运输系统的人员安排给农村以更多的供应品，科学工作者努力研究改善农业的方法，文艺工作者以他们的作品鼓舞农民的劳作。大家为着一个目标：争取大丰收，创造幸福生活。
    苏联和东欧人民民主国家谷物丰收，说明了社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越。苏联和东欧人民民主国家有计划地扩大耕种面积，使农业生产不断提高，增加粮食、饲料和工业原料的供应；而美国却在连年闹农产品“过剩”的危机，大量削减耕地面积，使中小农民大批破产，而劳动人民得不到充足的食物。苏联和东欧人民民主国家谷物丰收，也有力地显示了社会主义阵营经济力量的日益壮大。
    正在喜庆丰收的中国人民欢欣祝贺苏联和东欧人民民主国家谷物丰收，认为这对于加强社会主义阵营、巩固世界和平的事业具有极为重要的意义。
