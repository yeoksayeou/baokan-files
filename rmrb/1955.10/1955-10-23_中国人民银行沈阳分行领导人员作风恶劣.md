To the Editors:

    I am a member of the Communist Youth League and an employee of the Personnel Section of the Shenyang Branch of the People's Bank of China.

    In April 1954, in the spirit of the People's Daily editorial "Streamline Institutions, Improve Work Efficiency," I wrote an article (under the pseudonym Xu Feng) criticizing the Shenyang Branch's bloated organization and the chaotic phenomena such as overstaffing. After this article was published in the original Northeast Daily on April 14, the branch leaders, especially Liu Dianzhong, the head of the Personnel Section, began a series of attacks against me after learning that Xu Feng was my pseudonym. Section Chief Liu often sarcastically said I had "strong writing skills" and mockingly called me Xu Feng. He found me for "individual talks" more than twenty times and deliberately made things difficult for me at work. For example, at that time, I was ill and could not do field work at all, but he decided to transfer me to do field work; after I raised my opinion, this retaliatory decision was not implemented.

    Because I still adhered to principles and criticized various shortcomings in the work, Section Chief Liu became even more dissatisfied. He threatened me, saying that "the Municipal Party Committee is studying your problem" and wanted me to admit my mistakes. On February 7th of this year, he found me again for a talk, asking me to examine myself. I felt that I had made no mistakes and asked him to hold a meeting to discuss my problem, or to find comrades from the Municipal Party Committee to jointly clarify the problem. But he firmly insisted that I conduct a self-criticism in his room immediately. After suffering such a stimulus, the next day, my brain disease relapsed, and I was diagnosed by the doctor to rest. Taking advantage of my absence from work, he arranged for all the comrades in the section to give me opinions, and then compiled a material, saying that I was opposed to the leadership, creating division, spreading rumors, not believing in the Party, not supporting the Party, ideologically backward, and unclear about whom I served, etc., and showed it to me on March 28, wanting me to admit it. Section Chief Liu said that these were the opinions of the masses. I raised different opinions at the time and asked him to hold another meeting, with my participation, to jointly study this issue. He refused again.

    The problems existing in our Shenyang Branch are not just suppression of democracy. The leaders in the bank are also engaged in petty sectarianism, arbitrarily promoting cadres, and even engaging in illegal and undisciplined behavior and privately setting up tribunals. I have repeatedly raised these issues with Liu Dianzhong, but I have only been subjected to attacks. I have also continuously filed complaints and denunciations to the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the CPC, the Shenyang Municipal Committee, the Liaoning Daily, the Supervision Office of our bank, the Youth League organization, etc. Although the relevant departments are investigating, the problem has not been resolved so far. I once felt disappointed, but the incident of Zhang Baotong's victory in persisting in the struggle encouraged my courage to fight. I am determined to report this matter to you, hoping to get a correct solution.

### 中国人民银行沈阳分行领导人员作风恶劣

    中国人民银行沈阳分行领导人员作风恶劣编辑同志：
    我是一个青年团员，是中国人民银行沈阳分行人事科的工作人员。
    一九五四年四月，我曾根据人民日报“精简机构，提高工作效率”社论的精神，写稿（署名徐枫）批评沈阳分行机构臃肿和人浮于事等混乱现象。这篇稿件在四月十四日原东北日报发表后，分行领导人员，特别是人事科长刘殿忠，在知道徐枫是我的化名以后，就对我进行了一系列的打击。刘科长经常讽刺我“写作能力强”，并以讽刺的口吻叫我徐枫。他曾先后找我进行了二十多次“个别谈话”，并在工作上故意同我为难。例如，当时我有病，根本不能做外勤，他却决定调我做外勤；经我提出意见以后，这个报复性的决定才没有实施。
    由于我仍然坚持原则，对工作中的各种缺点提出批评，刘科长更为不满了。他威胁我说是“市委都在研究你的问题”，要我承认错误。在今年二月七日又找我谈话，要我检讨。我认为自己没有错误，要求他开会讨论我的问题，或找市委的同志来共同把问题搞清楚。但是他却坚决要我在他屋子里立即进行检讨。我受了这样的刺激后，第二天，脑病就犯了，经医生诊断休养。他趁我不上班的机会，就布置全科同志给我提意见，以后整理了一个材料，说我同领导对立，制造分裂，散布流言蜚语，不相信党，不拥护党，思想落后，为谁服务不明确等等，在三月二十八日给我看，要我承认。刘科长说，这是群众意见。我当时提出不同的意见，并要求他再召开会议，由我参加，共同研究这个问题。他又拒绝了。
    我们沈阳分行存在的问题还不仅是压制民主而已，行内领导人员还闹小宗派、乱提拔干部，甚至还有违法乱纪、私立公堂的行为。这些问题，我对刘殿忠曾不断提出过，但是受到的只是打击。我又不断向中共辽宁省委、沈阳市委、辽宁日报、本行监察室、团组织等进行了控诉和揭发，有关部门虽在检查，但问题到现在还没有解决。我曾经感到失望，但是，张宝桐坚持斗争得到胜利的事件鼓舞了我斗争的勇气。我下决心把这件事情反映给你们，希望能够得到正确的处理。
