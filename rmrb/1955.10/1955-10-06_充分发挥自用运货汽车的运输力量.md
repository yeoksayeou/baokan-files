The phenomenon of government agencies and enterprises blindly purchasing freight vehicles, as reflected in the letter from reader Zhong Ziming, also exists in many regions across the country, according to our understanding. Statistics show that in recent years, the number of self-owned freight vehicles in government agencies, enterprises, and other units has increased rapidly, reaching 181% of the number of vehicles in state-owned transportation units by the end of last year. Of course, it is necessary for various government agencies, enterprises, and other units to add some self-owned trucks based on the needs of production and capital construction; however, it is true that some units have purchased self-owned freight vehicles far exceeding their actual needs. For example, this year in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, 16 enterprises and units, including the Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Gansu Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau, already have sufficient transportation capacity or can utilize the vehicles of the transportation departments, but they are still preparing to add a large number of vehicles.

The result of blindly increasing self-owned freight vehicles, as reader Zhong Ziming reflects, is disrupting the local transportation order. In Zhejiang, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanghai, and other places, the phenomenon of government agencies and enterprises using self-owned freight vehicles to compete with transportation departments for freight sources by lowering freight rates and miscellaneous fees, underreporting transportation distances, and rushing to sign transportation contracts with cargo owners has also appeared. For example, the Shengxian and Tiantai operating groups of the China Food Company Zhejiang Provincial Company initially requested the local transportation company to transport 141 tons in April, but later switched to using the provincial food company's own vehicles for transportation, which thwarted the transportation company's plan. The blind increase in transportation vehicles by various enterprises and units in Shanghai has resulted in the Shanghai Transportation Company frequently sealing and suspending more than 200 vehicles. In Xi'an City, the materials that the Xi'an Transportation Company could not transport according to plan in February this year accounted for 26.8% of the total monthly consignment volume. In addition, there are also many unreasonable transportation practices caused by this phenomenon, such as vehicle detours, duplication, counterflow, and single-trip empty runs.

A large number of self-owned trucks in various government agencies and enterprises have low transportation efficiency due to poor management; although they are scrambling for freight everywhere, they still cannot fully utilize the transportation capacity of the vehicles. For example, the total number of vehicles in government agencies and enterprises in Shaanxi Province is two and a half times more than that of transportation units, but the average monthly transportation volume only accounts for one-third of the transportation volume of transportation unit vehicles. In the first quarter of this year, the transportation efficiency of self-owned freight vehicles in government agencies and enterprises in Xinjiang only reached 60% of that of state-owned transportation vehicles. The utilization rate of self-owned vehicles of the Jinan Construction Company in Shandong only reached 37%, about half of that of state-owned transportation vehicles. These self-owned trucks also have higher tire wear rates and fuel consumption than the vehicles of the transportation departments due to long-term poor maintenance and untimely repairs, which increases transportation costs. For example, the average ton-kilometer cost of self-owned freight vehicles in government agencies and enterprises in Dalian City is 17% higher than that of the transportation departments.

The erroneous practice of blindly purchasing freight vehicles, only considering the convenience of one's own unit, should be corrected immediately. Currently, the transportation capacity in many regions is not insufficient; the problem lies in how to fully utilize the existing transportation tools. Therefore, government agencies, enterprises, and other units in these regions should stop purchasing new vehicles and invest a large amount of funds in urgently needed construction projects. In areas where transportation capacity is insufficient, government agencies, enterprises, and other units should prioritize utilizing the vehicles of the transportation departments and carry out inter-regional adjustments within their own system when they need to add vehicles. In addition, the traffic management departments should appropriately carry out unified management of the self-owned trucks of government agencies, enterprises, and other units in accordance with the spirit of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement, which is also an effective way to fully utilize the transportation capacity of automobiles. For example, in the past, the average monthly transportation volume of ordinary vehicles in Sichuan Province was about 800 ton-kilometers, and some vehicles only ran 500 ton-kilometers; after implementing unified management, it increased to more than 1,200 ton-kilometers. Yunnan Province also achieved very good results in the first quarter of this year after implementing this method. The transportation departments in other regions should also conduct research based on local conditions and implement this method to overcome waste in transportation work.

### 充分发挥自用运货汽车的运输力量

    充分发挥自用运货汽车的运输力量
    读者锺子明来信反映的机关、企业盲目购置运货汽车的现象，据我们了解，在全国不少地区也是存在的。据统计，几年来全国机关、企业等单位的自用运货汽车迅速增加，到去年年底为止已经达到国营运输单位车辆的百分之一百八十一。当然，各机关、企业等单位根据生产和基本建设的需要增添一些自用货车是必要的；但是确实有些单位购置的自用运货汽车大大超过了实际的需要。例如，今年在陕西、甘肃两省，陕西省供销合作总社、甘肃省建筑工程局等十六个企业单位，本来运输力量已经够用，或者可以利用运输部门的车辆，但他们仍然准备增加大批车辆。
    盲目增加自用运货汽车的结果，正如读者钟子明所反映的，打乱了当地的运输秩序。在浙江、甘肃、陕西、上海等地也曾出现了机关、企业的自用运货汽车用压低运价和杂费、少算运输距离、争先和货主签订运输合同等各种办法，同运输部门争夺货源的现象。例如，中国食品公司浙江省公司嵊县和天台经营组，四月份共向当地运输公司提出托运一百四十一吨，后来改用省食品公司的自备车辆装运，就使运输公司的计划落了空。上海市各企业单位盲目增加运输车辆，使上海市运输公司经常封存、停滞汽车在二百辆以上。西安市运输公司今年二月份不能按计划运输的物资就占全月托运量的百分之二十六点八。此外，由于这种现象而造成的车辆迂回、重复、对流、单程空驶等不合理运输也很多。
    各地机关、企业大批的自用货车，因为管理不善，运输效率很低；虽然到处争揽货运，但仍然不能充分发挥车辆的运输效能。如陕西省机关、企业单位的汽车总数比运输单位多两倍半，但每月平均运输量仅占运输单位汽车运输量的三分之一。新疆今年第一季度机关、企业自用货车的运输效能，仅达国营运输汽车的百分之六十。山东济南建筑公司自用汽车利用率只达百分之三十七，为国营运输汽车的一半左右。这些自用货车又因为长期保养不好和修理不及时，轮胎磨损率和燃料的消耗量也比运输部门的汽车高，因而运输成本就增高了。如旅大市机关、企业单位自用货车的平均吨公里成本比运输部门高百分之十七。
    只顾本单位方便盲目购置运货汽车的错误作法，应该立即纠正。目前很多地区的运输力并不是不足的，问题在于怎样充分地利用现有的运输工具。因此，这些地区的机关、企业单位应该停止购买新车，把大量资金投到迫切需要的建设事业中去。在运输力不足的地区，机关、企业单位需要增添车辆时，也应该尽先利用运输部门的车辆，并在本系统内进行地区之间的调剂。此外，交通管理部门按照统筹兼顾、全面安排的精神，对机关、企业等单位的自用货车适当进行统一管理，也是充分发挥汽车运输力量的一个有效办法。例如，四川省过去一般汽车每月运输量平均在八百吨公里左右，有的汽车只跑五百吨公里；实行统一管理以后，提高到一千二百吨公里以上。云南省实行这个办法后，今年第一季度也取得了很好的效果。其它地区的交通部门也应该根据当地情况进行研究，实行这种办法，克服运输工作中的浪费。
