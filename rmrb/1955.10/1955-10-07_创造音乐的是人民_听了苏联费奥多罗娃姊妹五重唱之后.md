    "The People are the Creators of Music"
    -- After Listening to the Feodorova Sisters Quintet of the Soviet Union
    Li Huanzhi, Standing Director of the Chinese Musicians Association
    The great Russian classical composer Glinka said a famous saying: "The people create the music, and we artists only arrange it into tunes." This famous saying has been irrefutably confirmed by the development history of human musical culture.
    The progressive tradition of Russian national music, represented by Glinka, has today been truly and brilliantly developed under the most advanced Soviet social system. The flowers of people's music – people's songs and people's singing – have never blossomed so prosperously on the vast Soviet land as they do today. After the October Revolution, countless folk choirs of all kinds were born, and received strong support and care from the Party and the government, and were widely and enthusiastically loved by the Soviet people. These folk choirs are beautiful pearls in Soviet socialist musical culture, and a dazzling one among them is the Feodorova Sisters Quintet.
    The Feodorova Sisters appeared before the Chinese audience with their dignified and beautiful appearance. They wore elegant Russian national costumes, which made us seem to smell the fragrance of the Russian land; and their singing – so melodious, so simple, yet so expressive – brought us to the infinitely vast world of Russian people's lives.
    Chinese audiences have long been very familiar with the beautiful tunes of Russian folk songs. We deeply love Russian folk songs because they are the crystallization of the Russian people's high wisdom and labor. They are not only a precious treasure of Soviet people's musical culture, but also a valuable part of the world people's music treasury. The arrival of the Feodorova Sisters Quintet gave us the opportunity to see the performance of excellent Russian folk singers, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the beautiful qualities of Russian folk songs and the outstanding creative talents of the Russian people. No one has ever more accurately and powerfully assessed the value of folk songs than the Russian musicologist Serov. He said: "The people's songs, as musical organisms, are by no means the works of individual talented musical creators, but the works of the entire people. ...These are flowers on a given soil, as if they appeared in the world naturally, growing brilliantly, making people never think that they are the product of production and writing, and therefore rarely like the products of academic composers who grow in greenhouses or hothouses. Therefore, what is most vividly expressed is the purity of creation and (as Gogol aptly said in "Dead Souls") that high wisdom of simplicity, the main charm and main secret of any artistic creation."
    Among the songs performed by the Feodorova Sisters Quintet, there are the very distant and tranquil "The Field is Quiet", the lively and bright "Open-Air Ring Dance", and the humorous and witty "Seagull". The images of these songs are very clear and simple. They often repeatedly sing a tune, but it does not make people feel monotonous at all, because their tune image contains profound meaning. They are the crystallization of a long history. The beautiful qualities of folk songs are inseparable from the creative labor of countless talented folk singers for generations. The Feodorova Sisters also use the talents of true artists to permeate fresh creativity into every song.
    Like many excellent folk singers, the Feodorova Sisters did not study vocal music in specialized music schools. Their talents were nurtured by the singing tradition of the Russian people. An article describing them wrote: "...The four Feodorova sisters (now five sisters) have been singing Russian folk songs at home since they could remember. Their mother, Yakovlevna, brought them from the village of Pskov, where she was born and married, to the dormitory on Baltiyskaya Street in Leningrad, where their father, Feodorov, lived. Every member of this family could sing—father, mother, and children. The Feodorova sisters often sat on old tree trunks listening to their parents' duets, and on the same day after listening, they could recite the songs their parents had sung." They started from the singing life of the family, then participated in some amateur choir groups (choirs of clubs and factory cultural palaces), and did not become professional singing groups appearing on the concert stage until 1948. Their creative work quickly affected all parts of the Soviet Union. They often received strong help from professional singers and composers, and also established frequent close contact with the broad Soviet audience. Many workers created new songs for them. For example, a worker in Leningrad dedicated two songs to them: "Dream, My Dream" and "Waltz", and another female worker in Leningrad created "From the Capital, From Moscow" and "Afforestation Song" for them. Therefore, the repertoire of the Feodorova Sisters Quintet not only includes a large number of ancient Russian folk songs, but also includes a large number of modern Soviet folk songs. They not only established a solid foundation on the ancient musical tradition of the Russian people, but also obtained new blood nourishment from the broad living soil of the modern Soviet people, and from the Soviet people's high wisdom and creative labor. They also harmoniously combined the traditional talents of folk singing with the skills of professional musicians.
    The Feodorova Sisters Quintet has pioneered a brilliant path in the field of vocal art, and their experience is very valuable for the work of Chinese musicians. We warmly thank the Soviet artists delegation for bringing the beautiful fruits of socialist musical culture and the deep brotherly friendship of the Soviet people to the Chinese people. This friendship encourages us to contribute our greatest wisdom and labor to the socialist construction of our country and to the permanent friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people.

### “创造音乐的是人民”——听了苏联费奥多罗娃姊妹五重唱之后

    “创造音乐的是人民”
    ——听了苏联费奥多罗娃姊妹五重唱之后
    中国音乐家协会常务理事  李焕之
    伟大的俄罗斯古典作曲家格林卡说了一句名言：“创造音乐的是人民，而我们艺术家不过是把它编成曲子而已。”这句名言是为人类音乐文化的发展史所颠扑不破地证实了的。
    以格林卡为代表的俄罗斯民族音乐的进步传统，今天已在最先进的苏维埃社会制度下获得了真正的光辉无比的发扬。人民音乐的花朵——人民的歌曲和人民的演唱从来没有像今天这样繁荣地盛开在辽阔广大的苏维埃国土上。十月革命后，无数各式各样的民间合唱团诞生了，并得到党和政府的大力支持和关怀，得到苏联人民的广泛而热情的爱戴。这些民间合唱团都是苏维埃社会主义音乐文化中的美丽的珍珠，其中灿烂夺目的一颗就是费奥多罗娃姊妹五重唱队。
    费奥多罗娃姊妹以她们端庄美丽的仪表出现在中国听众面前，她们穿戴着俄罗斯民族典雅的服饰，使我们好像闻到了俄罗斯土地的芬芳；而她们的歌声——它是那么悠扬、那么纯朴，却又是那么富于表情——更把我们带到俄罗斯人民生活的无限广阔的天地里面去了。
    中国听众很久以来就非常熟悉俄罗斯民间歌曲的优美音调。我们十分喜爱俄罗斯的民间歌曲，因为那是俄罗斯人民高度的智慧和劳动的结晶，它们不仅是苏维埃人民音乐文化的珍贵财富，也同样是世界人民音乐宝库中极有价值的一部分。费奥多罗娃姊妹五重唱队的光临，使我们有机会看到俄罗斯优秀的民间歌曲家们的表演，从而更深地体会到俄罗斯民歌的优美的品质和俄罗斯人民的优异的创造才能。再没有比俄罗斯音乐学家谢洛夫更确切有力地估价人民歌曲的价值的了。他说：“人民的歌曲，作为音乐的有机体，决不是个别有才能的音乐创作家的作品，而是全体人民的作品。……这是既定土壤上的花朵，仿佛是自然而然在世界上出现的，长得光辉灿烂，使人一点也想不到是出于制作和编写，因而也就很少像温床或暖室里生长出来的学院派作曲家活动的产品。所以其中表现得最鲜明的是创作的纯真性以及（像果戈里在“死魂灵”里说得很中肯的）那种高度智慧的朴素性，任何艺术创作的主要魅力和主要秘密。”
    在费奥多罗娃姊妹五重唱队表演的歌曲中，有非常幽远恬静的“田野静悄悄”，有活泼明快的“露天环舞曲”，也有幽默富于风趣的“海鸥”。这些歌曲的形象是非常鲜明而质朴的，它们经常反复地唱着一句曲调，但丝毫不使人觉得单调，因为它们的曲调形象蕴含着意味深长的内容，它们是久远的历史的结晶。民间歌曲的优美品质是同世世代代无数天才的民间歌唱家的创造性劳动分不开的。费奥多罗娃姊妹们同样以真正艺术家的才能，把新鲜的创造力渗透到每一首歌曲中。
    同许许多多优秀的民间歌唱家一样，费奥多罗娃姊妹们并没有在专门的音乐学校里学过声乐，她们的才能是俄罗斯人民的歌唱传统所抚育成长的。在一篇记述她们的文章中写道：“……费奥多罗娃四姊妹（现在是五姊妹）从开始能记事起就在家里唱俄罗斯的民间歌曲。她们的母亲雅科夫里夫娜从她出生和结婚的地方普斯科夫的乡村，把她们带到父亲费奥多罗夫在列宁格勒的巴尔季斯卡亚大街所住的宿舍中去。这个家庭的每一个成员都能唱歌——父亲、母亲和孩子们。费奥多罗娃姊妹们常坐在老树干上听她们的父母的二重唱，而且在听过以后的当天她们就能背诵她们的父母所唱过的歌曲。”她们就是由家庭的歌唱生活开始，继而参加一些业余的合唱团体（俱乐部和工厂文化宫的合唱团），直到一九四八年才成为专业的歌唱团体在音乐会舞台上出现。她们的创造性的工作，很快地影响到苏联全国各地，她们经常得到专业歌唱家和作曲家的大力帮助，同时也同广大的苏维埃听众建立了经常的密切的联系。许多工人为她们创作新歌。譬如一个列宁格勒的工人献给她们两首歌曲：“梦，我的梦”和
  “圆舞”，另外一个列宁格勒的女工为她们创作了
  “从首都，从莫斯科来”和“造林歌”。所以在费奥多罗娃姊妹五重唱队的节目中不仅包括大量古老的俄罗斯民歌，而且也包括了大量的现代苏维埃的民歌。她们不仅在俄罗斯人民的古老音乐传统上建立了坚实的基础，而且更从现代苏维埃人民广阔的生活土壤中，从苏联人民高度的智慧和创造性的劳动中获得了新的血液的滋养。她们还把民间歌唱的传统才能同专业音乐家们的技巧和谐地结合起来。
    费奥多罗娃姊妹五重唱队在声乐艺术的领域里开辟了一条光辉的道路，她们的经验对于中国音乐家的工作是非常宝贵的。我们热情地感谢苏联艺术家代表团给中国人民带来了社会主义音乐文化的优美成果和苏联人民对中国人民的深厚的兄弟般的友谊。这友谊鼓舞着我们为我国社会主义的建设、为中苏两国人民永久的友好合作贡献出最大智慧和劳动。
