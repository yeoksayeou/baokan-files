Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 17th: TASS, New York, October 17th - Over a hundred prominent American social figures have published an open letter to President Eisenhower in various newspapers, appealing to Eisenhower in this letter to "find ways to consolidate the Geneva spirit" before the Geneva meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers.

The letter writers pointed out that the American people were greatly encouraged by the prospect of reconciliation and cooperation arising from the July meeting of the heads of government of the Four Powers, and despite the many remarks spread by government representatives "attempting to eliminate the Geneva spirit," they expressed hope for "the victory of the Geneva spirit."

The letter writers suggested that Eisenhower take the following specific measures:

	"First, since it is unlikely that either side will abandon its position on the issue of German reunification, a compromise solution should be studied that takes into account the legitimate security concerns of all relevant countries.

	Second, the negotiations on arms issues currently underway within the framework of the United Nations should turn to discussing the fundamental necessity of reducing and cutting armaments, and strive to reach a solution that eliminates the stalemate caused by disagreements on issues of supervision, prohibition, and prevention of surprise attacks.

	Third, take concrete steps to extensively develop trade needed by Eastern and Western countries; seek to re-evaluate the issue of "strategic materials"; formulate extensive plans for sending delegations composed of representatives from all sides to visit each other.

	Fourth, make every effort to consider consolidating the United Nations; the number of UN member states should be expanded in accordance with the principle of universal participation, granting all legitimate governments a position in the United Nations; use the United Nations' mediation to promote negotiations between countries as much as possible."

The letter concluded: "On the eve of the resumption of negotiations, in pursuit of a world we all yearn for, we boldly appeal to you and request that you seek ways to consolidate the Geneva spirit. Only by continuing negotiations at the conference table and frankly exchanging views without the threat of using force can a path to future peace be guaranteed."

Among those who signed the letter were: Ernest Weir, Chairman of "National Steel Corporation," James Warburg, banker and writer, Professor Linus Pauling, a famous scientist, Professor Kirk Bauder, Ms. Emilia Green-Balch, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Clarence Pickett, one of the leaders of the Quaker organization "American Friends Service Committee," Henry Hitt Crane, pastor of Detroit Central Methodist Church, Sandy F. Ray, Baptist pastor of Brooklyn, New York, and others.

    美国一百多个著名人士写信给艾森豪威尔
    要求采取具体措施巩固日内瓦精神
    新华社十七日讯　塔斯社纽约十七日讯：美国一百多个著名社会人士向各报发表了致艾森豪威尔总统的一封公开信，他们在这封信里向艾森豪威尔呼吁在四大国外长日内瓦会议前“找出巩固日内瓦精神的方法”。
    写信人指出美国人民受到四大国政府首脑七月会议后产生的和解和合作的远景的极大鼓舞，并且不顾那些“企图消灭日内瓦精神”的政府代表们散布的许多言论，对“日内瓦精神的胜利”表示抱有希望。
    写信人向艾森豪威尔建议采取下列具体措施：
    “第一，既然任何一方在统一德国问题上都很少可能放弃自己的立场，就应该研究出一个考虑到所有有关国家对安全的合法要求的妥协办法。
    第二，目前在联合国组织范围内进行的关于军备问题的谈判，应该转而讨论缩小和裁减军备的根本必要性，并且争取达成一种足以消除在监察、禁止和防止突然袭击问题上的分歧意见所造成的僵局的办法。
    第三，采取具体步骤广泛发展东西方各国所需要的贸易；谋求重新估计“战略物资”问题；制定关于派遣由各方面的代表组成的代表团互相访问的广泛计划。
    第四，尽一切力量来考虑巩固联合国的问题，应当本着普遍参加的原则扩大联合国会员国的数目，赋予所有合法的政府在联合国中的地位；利用联合国的斡旋来尽可能促进国与国之间的谈判。”
    信里最后说：“在恢复谈判的前夕，我们为了追求我们大家所向往的那样一个世界，大胆地向你呼吁，并且请求你谋求巩固日内瓦精神的方法。只有坐在会议桌旁继续谈判和在不使用武力威胁的情况下坦率交换意见，才能保证未来的和平道路。”
    在这封信上签名的有：“国民钢铁公司”董事长欧内斯特·魏尔，银行家、作家詹姆斯·华伯，有名的科学家莱穆斯·波林教授，柯尔克·波德教授，诺贝尔和平奖金获奖人埃米利亚·格林—贝奇女士，公谊会的一个组织“美国教友服务委员会”领导者之一克拉伦斯·皮克特，底特律中央卫理公会牧师根里·希特·克兰，纽约布鲁克林区浸礼会牧师桑迪·福·莱伊和其他等人。
