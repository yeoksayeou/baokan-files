Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd. The National Conference on Language Reform successfully concluded in Beijing this afternoon. The conference passed the revised draft of the Chinese Character Simplification Plan; determined the principles and steps for promoting Putonghua (Mandarin Chinese), the common language of the Han nationality, based on the Beijing dialect; and exchanged opinions on the preparatory work for the fundamental reform of Chinese characters.

Since its opening on the 15th, the conference has undergone nine days of group discussions and plenary speeches. At the final meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd, all representatives unanimously adopted a resolution (full text to be published separately).

Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee, spoke at the meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd. Based on past work experience, he explained that to carry out language reform work effectively, it is necessary to have: comprehensive planning, strengthened leadership, vigorous publicity, and mobilization of the masses.

Hu Qiaomu, member of the Chinese Language Reform Committee, delivered a summary speech at the meeting on the 23rd, entrusted by the presidium of the conference. He provided detailed explanations on the issues raised in the conference discussions, focusing on three areas: simplifying Chinese characters, promoting Putonghua based on the Beijing dialect, language standardization, and preparatory work for the fundamental reform of Chinese characters. He pointed out that language reform is a major political task, and this conference is only the beginning of language reform work. Simplifying Chinese characters is an urgent task that meets the needs of the broad masses, and it must continue to be actively pursued in the future. Promoting Putonghua based on the Beijing dialect is also an urgent task that meets the needs of the broad masses. It is a necessary step to strengthen the political, economic, and cultural unity of the Han nationality, and also a necessary step to further develop the Chinese language and prepare for the fundamental reform of Chinese characters. Promoting Putonghua has its difficulties, but as long as all sectors of the country vigorously advocate it, and especially if planned and systematic work is carried out first in schools, military units, government agencies, and people's organizations across the country, these difficulties can be gradually overcome. In order to promote Putonghua, achieve the standardization of the Chinese language, and prepare conditions for the fundamental reform of Chinese characters, the national linguistic and language education communities need to work together to conduct large-scale dialect surveys, vocabulary research, and on-site experiments with Chinese character reform plans, while also conducting extensive publicity and education among the people.

Zhang Xiruo, Minister of Education, delivered the closing address at the meeting. He hoped that all representatives attending the meeting would become promoters and organizers of language reform work, and correctly and completely implement and realize the resolutions of the conference.

    全国文字改革会议闭幕
    通过了汉字简化方案修正草案，确定了推广普通话的方针和步骤
    新华社二十三日讯　全国文字改革会议今天下午在北京胜利闭幕。这次会议通过了汉字简化方案修正草案；确定了推广以北京语音为标准音的普通话——汉民族共同语的方针、步骤；并对根本改革汉字的准备工作交换了意见。
    大会自十五日开幕以来经过九天的小组讨论和大会发言，在二十三日下午举行最后一次会议，会上，全体代表一致通过了决议（全文另发）。
    中国文字改革委员会主任吴玉章在二十三日下午的会上发言，他根据过去的工作经验，说明进行文字改革工作必须：全面规划，加强领导，努力宣传，动员群众才能做好。
    中国文字改革委员会委员胡乔木，受会议主席团委托在二十三日的会上作总结性发言。他就会议讨论中提出的问题，对简化汉字、推广以北京语音为标准音的普通话、汉语规范化和根本改革汉字的准备工作三个问题，作了详尽的说明。他指出，文字改革是一个重大的政治任务，这次会议仅仅是文字改革工作的开端。汉字简化是一个适应广大群众需要的迫切任务，在今后仍须积极继续进行。推广以北京语音为标准音的普通话同样是适应广大群众需要的迫切任务，这是加强汉民族政治、经济、文化的统一的必要步骤，也是进一步发展汉语和准备汉字根本改革的必要步骤。推广普通话是有困难的，但是只要全国各方大力提倡，并且首先在全国学校、部队、机关和人民团体中进行有计划有系统的工作，这些困难是完全可以逐步克服的。为着推广普通话，实现汉语的规范化，并为汉字的根本改革准备条件，需要全国语言科学界和语言教育界通力合作，对汉语进行大规模的方言调查工作、词汇研究工作和汉字改革方案的实地实验，同时需要对人民群众进行广泛的宣传教育。
    教育部部长张奚若在会上致闭幕词。他希望参加会议的全体代表成为文字改革工作的宣传者和组织者，把大会决议正确地、完满地予以贯彻和实现。（附图片）
