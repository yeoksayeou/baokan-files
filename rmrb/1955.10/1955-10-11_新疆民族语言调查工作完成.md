The Xinjiang National Language Survey Team, jointly formed by the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Central Institute for Nationalities, and the former Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, has completed its language survey work after more than a month.

The language survey team conducted extensive language surveys in more than 30 locations north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, targeting farmers, herdsmen, handicraftsmen, government cadres, teachers, students, housewives, businessmen, and people from all walks of life. In addition to recording the differences in vocabulary and grammar among dialects of various ethnic groups, they also collected 3,088 folk works of various ethnic groups, including folk tales, folk songs, riddles, maxims, proverbs, etc. Through this survey, they gained a general understanding of the dialects of Uyghur language in Kashgar, Ili, Turpan, and other regions; the relationship between Chinese Kazakh and Soviet Kazakh languages; the relationship between Chinese Kyrgyz and Soviet Kyrgyz languages; the situation of the Xibe language; and the situation of the "Shugnan" dialect of the Tajik language (a dialect of the Tajik language).

During the survey, the team also widely listened to the opinions of people of all ethnic groups regarding the investigation and development of their respective national languages and scripts. The survey team will analyze the phonetic, lexical, and grammatical characteristics of various dialects in the languages of various ethnic groups based on these data to create conditions for selecting the basic dialect for a standard language in the future.

    新疆民族语言调查工作完成
    由中国科学院语言研究所、中央民族学院和前新疆省人民政府联合组成的新疆民族语言调查队，历时一个多月，已完成语言调查工作。
    这个语言调查队曾经分别在天山南北的三十多个地方，向农民、牧民、手工业者、机关干部、教员、学生、家庭妇女、商人和社会人士等广泛进行了语言调查。除纪录了各民族各地区方言的词汇、语法上的差别以外，还搜集了各民族的民间作品，包括民间故事、民歌、谜语、格言、谚语等共三千零八十八首。通过这次调查，概括地了解了维吾尔语的喀什、伊犁、吐鲁番等地方言的情况；中国哈萨克语和苏联哈萨克语之间的关系；中国柯尔克孜语和苏联吉尔吉斯语之间的关系；锡伯语的情况；塔吉克语“舒格南”方言（塔吉克语方言的一种）的情况。
    调查队在调查期间并曾经广泛地听取了各民族人民对于调查和发展本民族语言文字方面的意见。调查队将根据这些资料，分析各民族语言中各种方言的语音、语汇和语法的特征，为今后选择标准语的基础方言创造条件。（本报驻乌鲁木齐记者）
