Guangdong Sugarcane Can Increase Production by Over Nine Million Dan

    Guangdong Province's sugarcane planting area has expanded by more than 60,000 mu compared to last year, and the yield per unit area is estimated to increase by 7% compared to last year. The 110,000 mu of improved sugarcane varieties promoted this year are growing particularly well. In Jieyang County, five agricultural production cooperatives in Xichang and two other townships have newly planted more than 190 mu of Taiwan Sugar No. 134 improved sugarcane varieties. It is estimated that the average yield per mu can reach more than 14,000 jin of raw sugarcane, with the highest reaching 20,000 jin. The total sugarcane output of the province this year is estimated to increase by more than nine million dan compared to last year.
    Currently, the sugarcane harvesting season in Guangdong is approaching, and state-owned and local state-owned sugar factories are actively preparing for crushing. The province's five major state-owned sugar factories have decided to start crushing ahead of schedule on November 1st. In order to ensure the supply of raw sugarcane at the beginning of the crushing season and to increase the sugar content of sugarcane, various places are mobilizing sugarcane farmers to do a good job in field management to promote sugarcane maturity and to implement the method of "ripe first, cut first, transport immediately." The Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture also plans to promote the method of harvesting sugarcane with small hoes and low cuts in areas where no ratooning sugarcane (to be replanted next year) is left, in order to increase the amount of sugarcane harvested per unit area. It is estimated that this method alone can increase the province's raw sugarcane harvest by more than 1.5 million dan. (Our correspondent in Guangzhou)

    广东甘蔗可增产九百多万担
    广东省今年甘蔗种植面积又比去年扩大了六万多亩，单位产量估计也可比去年提高百分之七；今年推广的十一万亩良种蔗，长得特别好。揭阳县锡场等三个乡的五个农业生产合作社，今年新植一百九十多亩台糖一三四良种蔗，估计平均每亩可产原料蔗一万四千斤以上，最高的可达二万斤。今年全省甘蔗总产量估计可比去年增产九百多万担。
    目前，广东甘蔗收获季节就要到来，各国营和地方国营糖厂，正在积极准备开榨。全省五大国营糖厂决定提前于十一月一日开榨。为了保证糖厂在开榨初期的原料蔗供应，和提高甘蔗的含糖份，各地正发动蔗农做好促进甘蔗成熟的田间管理工作和贯彻“先熟先斩，即斩即运”的办法。广东省农业厅并计划在不留宿根蔗（明年要换种）的地区，推广使用小锄低斩收获甘蔗的办法，以增加单位面积的收蔗量。估计单这一项办法，全省就可以增收原料蔗一百五十多万担。　（本报驻广州记者）
