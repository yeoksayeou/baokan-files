Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 27th: The head of the Burmese National Football Delegation, U Ba Thein, issued a farewell letter upon leaving China.

In his farewell letter, U Ba Thein, on behalf of the Burmese National Football Delegation, expressed his gratitude for the warm reception and welcome they received from the Chinese people during their stay in China.

U Ba Thein said: We came to China with the aim of exchanging experiences in sports technology between Myanmar and China and enhancing the friendship between the peoples of the two countries. However, what we actually gained was much broader than the above scope. We have seen the efforts of the Chinese people to realize the country's economic construction plan and the achievements that have already been made. In particular, seeing the healthy and optimistic spirit and the discipline of the Chinese people, we feel very envious and excited. We have also seen that this great country with a long history not only preserves ancient culture and art, but is also vigorously encouraging and promoting modern science and technology. We believe that China's progress in all aspects is the progress of the entire Asia, including Myanmar. Therefore, we feel particularly happy and honored.

The Chinese people's love of peace is consistent with ours. May we strengthen the friendship and health of the people of China and Myanmar through the development of sports, thereby serving the peace of Asia and the world.

During our visit to China, we went to Beijing, Wuhan, Guangzhou and other cities to conduct friendly matches. Despite the long distances and the different climates of China and Myanmar, we felt happy and comfortable due to the kind and good hospitality and care we received. In particular, in every city we arrived in, and on the trains, we were warmly welcomed by workers, farmers, citizens, and the People's Liberation Army, which made us unforgettable.

We guarantee that the members of our Myanmar football delegation will convey the sincere friendship of the person in charge of the All-China Sports Federation and the person in charge of the Chinese government to the Myanmar government and people, in order to further enhance the friendship and mutual understanding between China and Myanmar.

    缅甸国家足球代表团团长发表告别书
    新华社广州二十七日电　缅甸国家足球代表团团长苏巴特勒在离开中国时发表了告别书。
    苏巴特勒在告别书里代表缅甸国家足球代表团，对他们在中国期间受到中国人民的热情接待和欢迎表示谢意。
    苏巴特勒说：我们怀着交流缅中两国体育运动技术的经验和增进两国人民友谊的目的来中国访问。但是，我们实际所获得的东西却比上面的范围广泛得多。我们看到了中国人民正在为实现国家的经济建设计划而努力的情况，和已经获得的成就。特别是看到中国人民的健康乐观的情绪和遵守纪律的精神，使我们感到非常羡慕和兴奋。我们还看到这个有着悠久历史的大国，不但保存了古代的文化艺术，而且正在极力鼓励和推广现代的科学技术。我们认为中国在各方面的进步，就是包括缅甸在内的整个亚洲的进步。因此，我们感到特别愉快和光荣。
    中国人民热爱和平的心情和我们是一致的，愿我们通过体育运动的开展，来加强中缅两国人民的友谊和健康，从而为亚洲和世界和平服务。
    我们在访问中国期间，曾到北京、武汉、广州等城市进行友谊比赛，尽管路途遥远和中缅两国的气候不同，但由于受到亲切、良好的款待和关怀，我们感到愉快和舒适。特别是在我们到达的每一个城市，在火车上，都受到了工人、农民、市民、解放军的热烈欢迎，更使我们念念不忘。
    我们保证，我们缅甸足球代表团团员一定把中华全国体育总会负责人和中国政府负责人的真挚的友情转达给缅甸政府和人民，以进一步增进中缅两国之间的友好和相互了解。
