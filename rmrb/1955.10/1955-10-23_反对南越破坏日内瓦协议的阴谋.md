    Oppose the Conspiracy of South Vietnam to Sabotage the Geneva Accords

    The Ngo Dinh Diem clique intends to hold a so-called "referendum" in South Vietnam in order to elevate Ngo Dinh Diem to the position of "president" or "chief of state." According to the United Press, after this "referendum," the Ngo Dinh Diem clique also plans to stage another "referendum" to pass a "constitution" in November, and then create a so-called "National Assembly" in December.

    It is clear that Ngo Dinh Diem wants to rely on the so-called "referendum" under his police control to "legitimize" his unpopular regime in South Vietnam, and thereby turn South Vietnam into a separate country, plunging Vietnam into long-term division and making it impossible to implement the Geneva Accords.

    The implementation of this conspiracy by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is related to its attempt to drag South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. Government officials of Ngo Dinh Diem openly stated on the 19th: "Vietnam hopes that one day it can formally participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." According to the United Press, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique cannot currently join this organization because "the Geneva Accords on the Indochina issue would now prevent Vietnam from becoming a formal member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." It can be seen from this that the activities of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in creating a so-called "referendum" and trying to use it to undermine the Geneva Accords are paving the way for it to embark on this dangerous road.

    The Ngo Dinh Diem clique's activity of creating a "referendum" is in complete violation of the Geneva Accords. The Geneva Accords explicitly stipulate that the military demarcation line of Vietnam is a temporary line, which shall in no way be interpreted as a political or territorial boundary; the responsible authorities of both regions of Vietnam must conduct consultations and hold free general elections throughout Vietnam to restore the unity of Vietnam. Therefore, the South Vietnamese authorities have no basis for holding a separate "referendum" or "election" in South Vietnam as if it were an "independent country." As for the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's conspiracy to make South Vietnam join the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, it is strictly prohibited by Article 19 of the Vietnam Armistice Agreement and Article 5 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference.

    The Ngo Dinh Diem clique's actions to undermine the Geneva Accords have been supported and encouraged by the United States government. After the Ngo Dinh Diem clique announced the holding of this "referendum," US State Department spokesman Sultam hurriedly came out to declare that "the United States continues to support the free (!) government of Vietnam headed by Ngo Dinh Diem." At the same time, the US government has repeatedly expressed its support for the unreasonable position of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to refuse to consult on the general election throughout Vietnam in accordance with the Geneva Accords, and has openly planned for the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to hold separate "elections" in South Vietnam. The US government's support for the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in provoking new disputes in Vietnam and undermining international agreements runs counter to the "Geneva spirit."

    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam and all the Vietnamese people have unanimously expressed their opposition to this illegal act of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. The Vietnam Fatherland Front Unified Movement Committee issued a statement on the 16th, firmly condemning the conspiracy of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and its supporters to undermine the Geneva Accords and the unity of Vietnam. After exposing the conspiratorial purpose of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, the spokesman of the Prime Minister's Office of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out on the 18th that because this "referendum" farce violates the ardent wishes and fundamental interests of the Vietnamese people, all Vietnamese people from the south to the north oppose it. Insiders within the South Vietnamese ruling class, such as former South Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Phan Long, also issued declarations in Saigon, denouncing Ngo Dinh Diem's referendum as "having no political value."

    The Vietnam issue must be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, implementing free general elections throughout Vietnam to achieve the peaceful reunification of South and North Vietnam. This is the supreme interest and common aspiration of all the Vietnamese people. It is also an important link in ensuring peace and security in Southeast Asia. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the conspiracy of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to undermine the Geneva Accords. This conspiracy must not be tolerated by all countries and peoples who are concerned about and uphold the Geneva Accords.

### 反对南越破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋

    反对南越破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋
    吴庭艳集团要在越南南方举行所谓“公民投票”，以便把吴庭艳抬上“总统”或“国长”的地位。据合众社透露，吴庭艳集团在这个“公民投票”之后，还打算在十一月导演另一场通过“宪法”的“公民投票”，然后在十二月制造出一个所谓“国民议会”。
    很明显，吴庭艳是想依靠在他的警察控制之下的所谓“公民投票”来把它的不得人心的政权在南越“合法化”，并且由此把南越变成一个单独的国家，使越南陷于长期分裂，使日内瓦协议无法实施。
    吴庭艳集团的这个阴谋的实施，同它要把南越拉进东南亚侵略集团的企图是有关联的。吴庭艳的政府官员在十九日就公开说：“越南指望有一天它能正式参加东南亚条约组织”。据合众社说，吴庭艳集团目前还不能参加这个组织，是因为“关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协定现在会阻止越南成为东南亚条约组织的正式成员”。从此可以看到，吴庭艳集团制造所谓“公民投票”，力图借此破坏日内瓦协议的活动，就是为它走向这条危险的道路开辟途径。
    吴庭艳集团制造“公民投票”的活动完全违背了日内瓦协议。日内瓦协议明文规定，越南军事分界线是临时性的界线，无论如何不能被解释为政治的或领土的边界；越南双方地区负责当局必须进行协商，举行全越自由普选以恢复越南的统一。因此，越南南方当局没有任何根据可以把越南南方视同一个“独立国家”那样去举行单独的“公民投票”或“选举”。至于吴庭艳集团想要使越南南方加入东南亚侵略集团的阴谋，更是越南停战协定第十九条和日内瓦会议最后宣言第五条所严格禁止的。
    吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议的行为，受到了美国政府的支持和鼓励。在吴庭艳集团宣布举行这次“公民投票”之后，美国国务院发言人苏丹姆赶忙就出来声明“美国继续支持以吴庭艳为首的自由（！）越南政府”。同时，美国政府曾屡次表示支持吴庭艳集团拒绝按照日内瓦协议协商全越普选的无理立场，并公开地为吴庭艳集团策划在越南南方举行单独“选举”。美国政府这样支持吴庭艳集团在越南挑起新的纠纷，破坏国际协议，是同“日内瓦精神”背道而驰的。
    越南民主共和国和全越南人民对于吴庭艳集团这种非法行为，一致表示反对。越南祖国战线统一运动委员会在十六日发表了声明，坚决谴责吴庭艳集团和它的支持者企图破坏日内瓦协议、破坏越南统一的阴谋。越南民主共和国总理府发言人十八日在揭露了吴庭艳集团的阴谋目的后指出：由于这种“公民投票”的滑稽戏违反越南人民的热烈的愿望和根本的利益，全越南从南到北的人都反对它。南越统治阶级内部人士，如前南越总理阮蟠龙等也在西贡发表宣言，指斥吴庭艳的公民投票“没有任何政治价值”。
    越南问题必须按照日内瓦协议的规定，在全越南实行自由普选，使越南的南方和北方得到和平统一。这是全体越南人民的最高利益和共同愿望。这也是保障东南亚的和平和安全的重要环节。中国人民坚决反对吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋。这个阴谋是所有关心和维护日内瓦协议的国家和人民决不能容许的。
