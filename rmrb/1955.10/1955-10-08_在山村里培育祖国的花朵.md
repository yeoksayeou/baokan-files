    Nurturing the Flowers of the Motherland in Mountain Villages

    The second day of National Day, as dawn had just broken over the mountains, 256 primary school students at Zhenzhong Township Primary School in Yulin County, Guangxi Province, solemnly held an admission ceremony for new Young Pioneer members on the school's sports field. The parents of the new Young Pioneer members, as well as many guests from neighboring villages and the county town, came to participate.

    Chen Canhua, the 22-year-old female principal of Zhenzhong Township Primary School, watched with a smile as this group of "flowers" she had personally nurtured raised their little hands to take the oath. This daughter of a poor peasant family had served as a teacher in a literacy class for the people after graduating from senior primary school. Four years ago, she was promoted to primary school teacher. When she left her hometown for the first time with a burning heart to run a school in Zhenzhong Township, nestled in the mountains, she was greeted by two thatched huts and a group of children who often engaged in group fights and had even beaten teachers. This could not help but make her feel somewhat timid and uneasy. However, her love for the next generation and the deeds of Shi Ruifen in running schools gave her courage, and she decided to stay and work. On the first day of class, dozens of children swarmed into the classroom, and Chen Canhua had to shout for a long time before they quieted down a bit. As soon as she started the lesson, one child walked out of the classroom; then another followed. A child named Su Mingju was the naughtiest, making the younger students cry and hitting the older students. After struggling to get through the class, Chen Canhua looked sadly at the children rushing away, wondering: What is the reason? They weren't born like this!

    Chen Canhua began to make home visits. Only then did she learn that, before liberation, the two major families in the village, surnamed Du and Su, had many disputes due to the instigation of landlords, and the atmosphere of disunity between the families had left a bad influence on the children's minds. Chen Canhua returned to the school and arranged for students with the surnames Du and Su to sit together, encouraging them to interact more. At the same time, she used true stories from newspapers to promote the benefits of unity to the parents. In addition, the township's Party branch was also organizing farmers from both surnames to take the path of agricultural and forestry mutual aid and cooperation. Gradually, disputes between the two families decreased, adults became more amiable when they met, and the children followed suit, no longer "drifting off" during class. Su Mingju, the naughtiest child, gradually became a good student under Chen Canhua's patient education. He got first place in the final exam of the second semester. Su Mingju also continuously helped others, organizing classmates with poorer grades to review the topics together, and was therefore elected as the study group leader by the students.

    Usually, Chen Canhua paid great attention to labor education for the children. She told the children many stories about labor and, together with the students, cultivated plots of vegetable gardens and cornfields around the classroom, watering them and catching insects morning and evening. Last autumn, when harvesting corn, the children gave the fattest and largest corn to the teacher, saying: This is the fruit of our labor. This spring break, the students of this primary school also went to a nearby farm to help pull up rice roots.

    Four years have passed, and the number of students at Zhenzhong Township Primary School has increased from more than eighty to more than four hundred, and two branch schools have been developed. Several classrooms were newly built last winter and this spring. In the semester when Chen Canhua first arrived, more than 30% of the students repeated grades. Last semester, only 3% of the students repeated grades, and most of them were required to repeat because they were not old enough. Not long ago, the school announced the establishment of a Young Pioneer detachment, and more than 350 children of the required age submitted applications.

    At the beginning of this year, Chen Canhua was admitted as a member of the Communist Youth League and was elected as an outstanding education worker in the province. She said: "In the first Five-Year Plan of the motherland, I want to nurture more socialist 'flowers' in this mountain village."

    在山村里培育祖国的花朵
    新华社记者　周建英
    国庆节的第二天，曙光刚冒出山头，广西省郁林县镇忠乡小学的球场上，二百五十六个小学生在庄严地举行少年先锋队队员入队仪式。新的少年先锋队队员的父母，以及邻村和县城的许多客人都赶来参加。
    镇忠乡小学二十二岁的女校长陈灿华眼看这群由她亲手培育的“花朵”举着小手宣誓时，脸上露出了笑容。这个贫农的女儿在高小毕业后，担任了民校识字班教师。四年前，她被提升为小学教师。当她怀着一颗火热的心第一次离开故乡来到这个在丛山中的镇忠乡办学时，迎接她的是两间茅草房和一群经常集体打架并且打过老师的孩子。这不禁使她有些胆怯和不安起来。然而，对下一代的爱和史瑞芬办学的事迹给了她勇气，她决定要留下来工作。上第一课的时候，几十个孩子一窝蜂冲进课室，陈灿华费劲喊了半天，才安静一些。她刚开口讲课，有一个孩子走出课室去了；接着又一个出去了。一个叫苏明琚的孩子最淘气，逗哭了小同学，又打大同学。好容易坚持到下课，陈灿华难受地望着飞奔而去的孩子们想：是什么缘故呢？他们不会生来就是这样的！
    陈灿华开始去作家庭访问。这才知道，原来解放前，村里姓杜和姓苏的两大家族间，因受地主挑拨，纠纷很多，家族间不团结的气氛在孩子们的心灵上留下了不良的影响。陈灿华回到学校，把姓杜姓苏的学生编坐一起，让他们多接近。一面又用报纸上的真人真事向家长们宣传团结的好处，加上乡的党支部也正在组织两姓农民走农、林业互助合作的道路，渐渐地，两个家族间纠纷减少了，大人们见了面挺和气，孩子也跟着学，上课也不“开小差”了。原来最淘气的孩子苏明琚，在陈灿华的耐心教育下，也慢慢地变成一个好学生了。第二学期期终考试时，他得了第一名。苏明琚还不断帮助别人，把功课较差的同学组织起来，一同温习课题，因此被同学们选做学习组长。
    平时，陈灿华很注意对孩子们的劳动教育，她对孩子们讲了许多关于劳动的故事，并且和学生一起在教室周围垦辟了一畦畦的菜田和玉米地，朝晚浇水捉虫。去年秋天收摘玉米时，孩子们把最肥壮的大玉米送给老师说：这是我们劳动的果实。今年春假，这个小学的学生还到附近一个农场去帮助拔禾根。
    四年了，镇忠乡小学的学生从八十多个增加到现在的四百多个，并发展了两个分校，有好几间课室还是去冬今春新建的。陈灿华刚来的那学期，有百分之三十以上学生留级，上学期留级学生只有百分之三，而其中大多数因年龄不够格才要他们重读的。不久前，学校宣布要成立少先队队部，三百五十多个及龄儿童都递上了申请书。
    今年年初，陈灿华被吸收为团员，并当选为全省优秀教育工作者。她说：“在祖国第一个五年计划里，我要在这山村里培育出更多的社会主义的‘花朵’来。”
