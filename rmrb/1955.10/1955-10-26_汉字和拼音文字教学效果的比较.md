A comparison of the Teaching Effects of Chinese Characters and Pinyin Writing
Wang Maoye, Director of Teaching Affairs, Attached Primary School of Lüda Normal School

It is universally acknowledged that Chinese characters have made great contributions to the long cultural history of our people. However, it is also universally acknowledged that Chinese characters have serious shortcomings. Therefore, Chairman Mao instructed us: "Writing must be reformed under certain conditions" and "must move towards the common phonetic direction of world writing." This is completely correct. Pinyin writing is indeed superior to square Chinese characters. From my experience in experimenting with teaching Latinized New Writing in the first grade of primary schools in Dalian, I have gained some profound insights: After learning Latinized New Writing for one and a half months, six out of fifty seven-year-old children in the class were able to write sentences. After studying for a year, half of the fifty children in the class could use Latinized New Writing to write articles of more than one hundred characters with relatively concrete and complete content. Zhang Shaorong, a ten-year-old child, had previously studied Chinese characters for more than a year. If he were asked to read the text in the first-grade Chinese textbook, he could barely read along the sentences. However, when given a dictation based on the text, out of the two hundred and eighty-eight characters dictated, he wrote one hundred and three characters correctly, thirty-two characters incorrectly, and could not write one hundred and fifty-three characters. It would be even more impossible for him to write sentences using the Chinese characters he had learned. But after studying Latinized New Writing for a year, he could also write articles of more than one hundred characters.

If we use Chinese character teaching, children are still starting to learn simple stroke characters one and a half months after the start of the first grade; writing articles only starts in the third grade. Generally speaking, in primary schools, not only third graders but also fourth, fifth, and sixth graders encounter many characters they don't know how to write when writing articles. Teachers are very distressed and reflect: Composition class has become a character-asking class! But first-grade children who have only studied Latinized New Writing for a year have no characters they don't know how to write when writing articles!

I once conducted a survey comparing the reading abilities of children after learning Latinized New Writing and Chinese characters: I asked children in the first grade who were learning Chinese characters to read the story "Lenin and the Blacksmith" (a text from the fifth-grade Chinese textbook), and children in the first grade who were learning Latinized New Writing to read the translated version of this story in Latinized New Writing. These two children were in the same grade, the same age, and their academic performance was excellent. The child who learned Latinized New Writing quickly finished reading the story, not only without encountering any unfamiliar characters but also being able to completely retell the content of the story, and even rewrite the story in Latinized New Writing. However, the child who learned Chinese characters encountered many unfamiliar characters when reading the story, read it haltingly, had only a vague understanding of the story's content, and could not even think about rewriting it.

One more point must be noted: After first-grade children learn Latinized New Writing, their pronunciation gradually becomes correct. They can not only read the text according to the pronunciation of Mandarin Chinese but also usually speak according to the pronunciation of Mandarin Chinese. In addition, after children learn Latinized New Writing, they also easily develop the habit of using word linking and punctuation marks.

In short, the results of this teaching experiment in the first grade of primary schools in Dalian prove that Latinized New Writing is indeed a phonetic writing system that is easy to recognize, easy to write, and easy to use. Using this phonetic writing system in schools will quickly improve students' cultural and scientific knowledge level. Of course, this is only a preliminary teaching experiment. In the future, when our country adopts phonetic writing, the quality of teaching will certainly be higher. We can understand this by looking at the situation in Soviet schools. I once visited classroom teaching in Soviet schools in Dalian. I paid special attention to understanding the situation of Soviet primary school students learning Russian: In the first grade, they spent the first half of the year learning letters and phonetics; from the second half of the year, Russian was divided into reading class, grammar class, writing class, speaking, and composition class. From the reading class alone, we can see the superiority of phonetic writing. Soviet primary school students learn from the book "Mother Tongue" in the reading class. The first volume of "Mother Tongue" (for first grade) has a total of one hundred and sixty-three lessons. The knowledge that Soviet primary school students gain from this book is multifaceted: In addition to the opening poem "Stalin Thinks of Us" and the final lesson "The Soviet National Anthem," there are lessons about commemorating Lenin, about the Soviet Red Army, about family life, about school life, about hygiene, and about the seasons. One can imagine how rich the vocabulary and knowledge of life included there is.

In addition to the rich content, what is particularly noteworthy is that ninety-eight out of these one hundred and sixty-three lessons (accounting for 60 percent) were not written by the textbook editors themselves but are selected works by famous writers. Among them are articles and poems by world-renowned great writers such as Tolstoy, Lermontov, Pushkin, Ilyin, Mayakovsky, Mikhailov, and others. In contrast, our first-grade Chinese textbooks do not even have a single literary selection. Why is this? Are our textbook editors not good enough? Are they unwilling to compile textbooks like the Soviet ones? No, absolutely not! Our textbook editors have spent countless efforts studying how to compile textbooks reasonably and scientifically, but they cannot find the only correct solution. The reason does not lie with the editors but with the square Chinese characters we use. Because if we compile the content of our textbooks to be richer, we have to use more new characters. In this way, although our children and Soviet children both enter school at the age of seven, Soviet children learn language and literature at the same time in the first grade of primary school; while our children can only learn characters, and they don't even learn them well. This is only the situation in the first grade, and the difference is so great. If we compare Soviet primary school graduates with our primary school graduates (Soviet primary school is four years, and our primary school is six years), the disparity in their reading and writing abilities will be very astonishing!

If our country adopts phonetic writing, so that the descendants of the people—children—can learn writing easily and quickly, and use more time and energy to learn cultural and scientific knowledge, how wonderful that would be! What great benefits would that bring to our country's socialist construction!

For the sake of the working people, for the sake of children and youth, for the sake of the development prospects of our culture and science, and also for the sake of our country's socialist construction, the reform of our country's writing is indeed a project that can no longer be delayed.

Of course, in our country, we cannot implement phonetic writing all at once right now. Before implementing phonetic writing, we need to do a lot of preparatory work. Simplifying Chinese characters and vigorously promoting Mandarin Chinese based on the northern dialect and using the Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation are some important preparatory work.

I feel that enabling the broad masses of people to gradually learn pinyin, develop the habit of pinyin, and investigate the learning effect of phonetic writing, as well as create teaching experience for phonetic writing, are also important conditions that should be actively prepared. Therefore, I suggest:

(1) The Chinese Writing Reform Committee and the Ministry of Education should formulate a phonetic writing plan as soon as possible, and ask the State Council to announce its national use.

(2) The Ministry of Education and the Chinese Writing Reform Committee should designate one or two primary schools to focus on experimenting with phonetic writing teaching.

    汉字和拼音文字教学效果的比较
    旅大师范附属小学教导主任　王茂业
    汉字在我国人民的悠久的文化历史中有过伟大的贡献，这是谁都承认的。但是汉字有严重的缺点，这也是谁都承认的。因此，毛主席指示我们说：“文字必须在一定条件下加以改革”，“要走世界文字共同的拼音方向”。这是完全正确的。拼音文字确实比方块汉字优越。我从大连的小学在一年级试验拉丁化新文字教学中，得到了一些深刻的体会：满七岁的小孩子学了一个半月的拉丁化新文字，在全班五十人中就有六名能够写话。到学了一年之后，全班五十人中就有二分之一的小孩子能用拉丁化新文字写出一百多字内容比较具体完整的文章。满十岁的张绍荣小朋友，过去曾经学了一年多的汉字，要是让他读一年级语文课本里的课文，还可以顺着句子勉强读下来，但是根据课文听写，在他听写的二百八十八个字中，写对的字有一百零三个，写错的字有三十二个，写不上来的字有一百五十三个。要是让他用学过的汉字写话，就更不行了。但是他学了一年拉丁化新文字以后，他也能写出一百多字的文章来了。
    如果用汉字教学，在一年级开学一个半月以后，小孩子还在开始学习笔画较简单的生字；写文章，在三年级才开始。就一般小学里的作文情况来说，不仅是三年级的，就是四、五、六年级的小孩子写起文章来，不会写的字也很多。老师们都很苦恼地反映说：作文课成了问字课！但是仅仅学了一年拉丁化新文字的一年级的小孩子，在写文章的时候，却没有不会写的字了！
    我曾经做过一次小孩子学了拉丁化新文字和汉字以后的阅读能力比较的调查：让在一年级学汉字的小孩子阅读“列宁和炉匠”（小学五年级语文课本里的课文）这篇故事，让在一年级学拉丁化新文字的小孩子阅读用拉丁化新文字翻译的这篇故事。这两个小孩子是同年级，同年龄，学习成绩也都是优等的。那个学拉丁化新文字的小孩子，很快地读完了这篇故事，不但没有不认识的字，而且还能把读过的故事内容完整地讲述出来，甚至还能用拉丁化新文字把故事内容重新写出来。可是那个学汉字的小孩子，在读这篇故事的时候，遇到了许多不认识的字，溜着读下来，对故事的内容是一知半解的，根本就谈不到重写出来了。
    还有一点必须注意的：一年级的小孩子学了拉丁化新文字以后，他们的语音逐渐地正确起来了，不但读课文能按照普通话的语音来读，而且平常也能按照普通话的语音来说话。另外，小孩子在学了拉丁化新文字以后，对词儿连写和标点符号的使用，也都容易养成习惯。
    总而言之，从大连的小学一年级的这种教学试验的结果证明：拉丁化新文字确实是容易认、容易写和容易用的拼音文字；在学校里使用这种拼音文字教学，学生的文化科学知识水平将会很快地提高的。当然这仅仅是一个初步的教学试验。将来我国改用拼音文字以后，教学质量一定是会更高的。在这一方面，我们看看苏联学校里的情况就可以明白的。我曾经到大连的苏联学校里去参观课堂教学。我特别注意了解了一下苏联小学生学习俄语的情况：他们在一年级，用前半年的时间就学完了字母和拼音；从后半年起，俄语分成阅读课、语法课、写字课、说话和作文课来学习。单从阅读课，我们就会看出拼音文字的优越性了。苏联小学生在阅读课里是学习“祖国语言”这本书。“祖国语言”第一册（一年级用）这本书里一共有一百六十三课。苏联小学生从这本书里所获得的知识是多方面的：除了开头的“斯大林想到我们”的诗篇和末尾的“苏联国歌”这两课以外，还有关于纪念列宁、关于苏联红军、关于家庭方面、关于学校方面、关于清洁卫生以及季节方面的课文。可以想到这里边包括了怎样丰富的词汇和生活方面的知识。
    除了内容丰富之外，还有值得我们特别注意的是这一百六十三课里边倒有九十八课（占百分之六十）不是教科书编者自己编写的，而是各名作家的文选。其中有世界闻名的托尔斯泰、莱蒙托夫、普希金、伊林、马雅可夫斯基、米哈伊洛夫等伟大作家的文章和诗篇。反过来看，我们的一年级语文课本里却连一篇文选也没有。这是什么原因呢？难道我们的教科书编者不好吗？是他们不肯编成像苏联那样的课本吗？不是，完全不是！我们的教科书编者为研究合理、科学地编写课本，不知道花费了多少心血，但是，找不出唯一正确的解决方法。原因不在编者，而在于我们使用的方块汉字。因为我们的课本内容编得丰富一点，就要使用更多的生字。这样一来，虽然我们的小孩子和苏联的小孩子都是七周岁入学，可是苏联的小孩子在小学一年级就一面学习语言，一面学习文学；而我们的小孩子却只好光认字，而且还认不好。这仅仅是一年级的情况，差别就这么大，要是拿苏联的小学毕业生和我们的小学毕业生（苏联小学是四年，我们的小学是六年）互相比较一下的话，他们之间的阅读能力和写作能力的悬殊会是十分惊人的！
    如果我国改用拼音文字，使人民的后代——小孩子很容易、很迅速地学会了文字，而用更多的时间和精力来学习文化科学知识，那该有多么好！那对我们国家的社会主义建设事业，会有多么大的好处！
    为劳动人民着想，为儿童和青年着想，为我们的文化和科学的发达前途着想，也是为我们国家的社会主义建设事业着想，我国的文字改革，实在是一件不能再拖延的工程。
    当然，在我们的国家里，现在还不能一下子实行拼音文字。在实行拼音文字以前，要做许多准备工作。简化汉字和大力推广以北方话为基础方言，以北京语音为标准音的普通话，就是一些重要的准备工作。
    我觉得：使广大的人民群众逐步地学习拼音、养成拼音习惯，和调查拼音文字的学习效果以及创造拼音文字的教学经验，也是应该积极准备的重要条件。因此，我建议：
    （一）中国文字改革委员会和教育部早日制定拼音文字方案，并请国务院公布全国使用。
    （二）教育部和中国文字改革委员会指定一二所小学，重点试验拼音文字教学。
