Excellent German Print Art
    Li Qun

    The "Print and Sculpture Exhibition of the German Democratic Republic" currently being held in Beijing has been warmly welcomed by Chinese artists and the general public. Among the exhibited works, apart from a small number of sculptures and classical prints, the majority are creations by modern printmakers from the German Democratic Republic. The diverse styles, forms, and the strong national character unique to German art in these works have left us with a deep impression.

    Here, I would like to focus specifically on prints:
    German print art has a long history and a rich heritage, occupying an important place in both German and world art history. German prints reached an extremely high level in the sixteenth century, and the "Portrait of Mother" by the great artist Albrecht Dürer, displayed in this exhibition, is a vivid example. In this work, the author used concise techniques to depict a correct and solid image, and truthfully portrayed the expression and character of his ailing mother. In the twentieth century, Germany produced the great revolutionary realist printmaker Käthe Kollwitz, a name very familiar to Chinese artists. Mr. Lu Xun had already introduced a special collection of her works in 1936. She had a great influence on Chinese revolutionary art. In addition, we must not forget the illustrations made by the German woodcut artist Max Pechstein for the Soviet writer Fyodor Gladkov's novel "Cement," which Mr. Lu Xun introduced to China in 1930, and which also influenced the early Chinese revolutionary woodcuts. This illustrates the excellent tradition of German print art and its relationship with the Chinese people.

    Since the Third German Art Exhibition in 1953, the visual artists of the German Democratic Republic have greatly strengthened the work of revitalizing print art. The German Visual Artists Association decided to hold print exhibitions every year, and they and progressive artists in West Germany are studying and following the "Outline on People's Cultural Construction in the German Democratic Republic" published by the Ministry of Culture of the German Democratic Republic to carry out their work. In January 1955, German artists held an all-German print exhibition in Berlin, exhibiting more than four hundred prints. The prints now on display in Beijing were selected from this exhibition. It is a very gratifying thing to have the opportunity to see these excellent German prints of recent years.

    Everyone admired Professor Arno Mohr's etching "Workers in a Steel Rolling Mill" with great interest. This print does not depict any machinery, but because it vividly depicts the scene of four workers waiting for the steel to come out with joy and confidence, we feel as if there is a steel furnace in front of them. These four workers each have their own postures and personalities, but they all express a sense of ownership and a consistent sense of responsibility for their work. This is an interesting picture. The painter concentrates the figures on one side of the picture, leaving a very large space on the other side, and uses the lines of sight and shadows of the figures to fill the space, and allows the audience to follow the lines of sight of the figures in the picture to generate many associations through this space, expressing an infinite realm on a limited picture. Looking at the images of German workers in this picture, and then comparing them with the images of German workers in Käthe Kollwitz's pictures in the past, we feel very happy, just as we feel happy when we see that the faces of our new workers are completely different from what they were before liberation. Professor Mohr also has five other lithographs that are very successful, including "Self-Portrait" and "Worker's Head," which show his high level of drawing skills, and "Football Field," "Children Playing on Ice," and "Two Workers," which are extremely vivid sketches. These works express a strong atmosphere of life, the new spirit of the people, and the artist's熟练techniques.

    The young lithographer Klaus Weber's "The Ruhr Uprising" depicts the revolutionary historical event of 1920, showing the heroic struggle of the Ruhr workers at that time. In the picture, three workers face the factory area under the night, which is in fierce struggle, expressing a brave, alert, and tense expression, as if we can hear the sound of gunfire coming from the dim distance, and we feel as if they are about to run to meet the enemy. The horse pulling the cart that was killed in the foreground square shows that there has been a battle here, which greatly strengthens the temporary calm in the turbulent atmosphere. The black and white contrast of the picture gives people a strong feeling of night. Its realism brings us into the exciting history, making us feel deep sympathy for the insurgent Ruhr workers.

    Professor Rudolf Bergander, the principal of the German Democratic Republic Academy of Fine Arts, drew lithographs depicting the life of German workers, women, and children in the new society: "Copper Casting" shows the tense labor of German workers as masters of the new society. The images of the figures are very vivid, and the black and white tones of the picture are handled very beautifully. "Kindergarten" and "Women Rebuilding Their Homes" show the important responsibilities German women bear in cultivating the next generation and in the construction work of rebuilding their homes after the war. The two lithographs "Buildings on Stalin Street" by the young artist Gerhard Kettner depict how much disaster the heinous war launched by the fascist gangs brought to the German people, and how much labor the German people paid in order to heal the serious wounds of war and rebuild a better city.

    Hans Baluschek, a winner of the National Prize, created the pen drawings "People of the World, Extend Your Hands!" and "Song of the Prisoner" as illustrations for the song collection of the World Youth and Student Festival held in Berlin in 1951. The former is a picture calling for peace, expressing the common wishes of people all over the world, and expressing the friendly spirit of people of different skin colors, different languages, and different beliefs uniting under the banner of peace. The latter is very interesting and powerful, depicting: an Eastern rickshaw puller (representing the colonial people) throwing the colonial rulers into the garbage dump. He also has a charcoal drawing entitled "Children in 'Paradise'," which shows the tragic fate of oppressed black children in America. Through vivid artistic images, Baluschek's works express noble internationalist thoughts and feelings.

    Kurt Querner's series of paintings "Peasant War" are brush paintings, which depict the peasant war that took place in Germany around 1500. This theme was also depicted by Käthe Kollwitz. Therefore, Chinese readers are no strangers to the historical events expressed in these works.

    Landscape prints occupy a large part of the entire exhibition. Karl Hennemann-Swirling, the author of the woodcut "Pine Tree in a Storm," is an old printmaker who is now seventy-one years old. His romantic work makes people feel like it is a beautiful lyric poem. The picture is smooth, the knife technique is bold, the melody formed by the black and white tones and the healthy and magnificent mood of the whole picture are very harmonious. His other work, "Meadow Flowers," is a beautiful lyrical woodcut that lies between landscape and still life. These two woodcuts express the artist's deep understanding of nature and beautiful feelings.

    Professor Walter Klemm is the oldest printmaker among the authors of these exhibits. He is 72 years old this year, and his works enjoy a high reputation in Germany. In this exhibition, there are his works such as "Little Deer," "Skating Rink," "Winter Scene," and "Little Crane." "Skating Rink" is a colored woodcut, and "Winter Scene" is an ink painting. Both are very beautiful landscapes, cleverly showing the winter scene and having a special style. From "Little Deer" and "Little Crane" we can see Klemm's love for these small animals, as well as his highly realistic techniques in expressing the life and spirit of small animals.

    The German printmaker Herbert Tucholski, who visited our country this time, also participated in the exhibition with two etchings and two woodcuts, depicting the scenery of German villages, fishing boats, forests, and industrial areas. The works are all highly skilled, powerful and solid, simple and beautiful, and are loved by many Chinese printmakers.

    In addition, there are Professor Bernhard Kretzschmar and Otto Paetz's etchings and lithographs of landscapes, as well as Professor Hans-Theo Richter's lithographs "Girl and Flowers" and "Children Drawing," Werner Klemke's woodcut illustrations for Gorky's "The Torments of the World," Wilhelm Lachnit's "Leading the Ox," Kurt Zimmermann's "Korean Mother," Cora Carff's woodcut "Basket Maker," and National Prize winner Professor Josef Hegenbarth's "Wildcat" and other works, all of which are very beautiful, and I will not discuss them in detail.

    In general, modern German prints have strong expressiveness, diverse styles, solidity, power, clarity, conciseness, and clearly express the characteristics of German national art, which is exactly what our printmakers need to learn well today.

    优秀的德国版画艺术
    力群
　　正在北京举行的“德意志民主共和国版画和雕塑展览”，受到了中国美术家和广大群众的热烈欢迎。展出作品中，除了一小部分雕塑和古典版画外，大部分是德意志民主共和国现代版画家的创作。这些作品多样的风格、形式和德国艺术所特有的强烈的民族色彩，给我们留下了深刻的印象。
　　这里，我想专就版画来谈谈：　　德国的版画艺术，有悠久的历史和丰富的遗产，它在德国艺术史上和世界艺术史上都占有重要的地位。德国的版画在十六世纪已达到极高的水平，在这个展览会上陈列的当时的大画家阿尔伯席特·丢勒的“母亲像”就是一个鲜明的例子。作者在这个作品中用简练的手法画出了正确坚实的形象，并真实地刻划了他病着的母亲的神情和性格。二十世纪的德国又出现了伟大的革命现实主义的版画家凯绥·珂勒惠支，这个名字对于中国艺术家们是非常亲切的。关于她的作品，鲁迅先生于一九三六年就曾有专集介绍。她在中国革命艺术中有很大的影响。此外，我们还不能忘记鲁迅先生于一九三○年介绍到中国的德国木刻家梅斐尔德为苏联作家革拉特珂夫的小说“士敏土”所作的插图，它对于中国初期的革命木刻也曾发生过影响。这说明了德国版画艺术的优良传统，也说明了它和中国人民的关系。
    自从一九五三年第三届德国艺术展览会以后，德意志民主共和国的造型艺术家们就大大加强了版画艺术的复兴工作。德国造型艺术家联盟决定每年都要举办版画展览会，他们和西德的进步艺术家们都研究并且遵照德意志民主共和国文化部发表的“关于德意志民主共和国的人民文化建设”纲要来进行工作。一九五五年一月，德国艺术家在柏林举办了一个全德的版画展览会，展出了四百幅以上的版画作品。现在在北京展出的版画就是从这个展览会中选出的。我们有机会看到德国近年来的这些优秀的版画，真是一件十分可喜的事。
    大家以极大的兴趣欣赏阿尔诺·莫尔教授的腐蚀版画“钢铁延压厂的工人”。这幅版画，画面没有画出一点机器，但由于生动地画出了四个工人带着愉快的心情和胜利的信心在等待出钢的情景，就使我们感到好像在他们前面有炼钢炉。这四个工人，各有各的姿势和性格，但他们都表现了主人翁的态度，以及对于工作的一致的责任心。这是一幅富有情趣的图画，画家把人物集中在图画的一边，使另一边留下极大的空间，而用人物的视线和人物的身影把空间充实起来，并使观众跟着画面人物的视线通过这块空间发生很多联想，在有限的画面上表现了无限的境界。看了这幅图画中的德国工人的形象，再同凯绥·珂勒惠支的图画中过去的德国工人形象比较一下，就使我们感到非常高兴，就像我们看到了我国新的工人的面貌已经完全不同于解放以前的那种样子时一样的高兴。莫尔教授还有其他五幅石版画也非常成功，其中的“自画像”和“工人的头像”，表现了他高度的素描修养，“足球场”、“在冰上游玩的孩子”和“两个工人”，都是极其生动的速写。这些作品表现了强烈的生活气息、人们的新的精神和艺术家稔熟的技巧。
　　青年石版画家克劳斯·韦伯的“鲁尔人民的起义”，描绘了一九二○年的革命历史事件，表现了当时鲁尔工人英勇斗争的情景。画中三个工人面对着正在激烈斗争中的夜幕下的工厂区，表示了勇敢、机警和紧张的神情，使我们好像听到了从昏暗的远处传来的枪声，也使我们感到他们好像就要跑去迎战了。那前景的广场上被打死的拉车的马，说明了这里曾经经过战斗，它大大加强了在动乱的气氛中的广场暂时的平静。画面的黑白对比，给人以强烈的夜的感觉。它造型的真实感把我们带到了令人激动的历史中去，使我们对起义的鲁尔工人引起深切的同情。
　　德意志民主共和国美术学校的校长鲁道夫·倍尔刚德教授的石版画，画出了德国工人和妇女儿童在新社会的生活：“铸铜”表现了作为新社会的主人的德国工人紧张的劳动，人物的形象很生动，画面黑白调子处理得很美。“幼儿园”和“重建家园的妇女”，表现了德国妇女在培养后一代和在战后重建家园的建设工作中所担负的重大责任。青年艺术家盖尔哈特·凯特纳的两幅石版画“斯大林街的建筑”，描绘出法西斯匪帮所发动的罪恶战争给德国人民带来了多么大的灾难，为了医治严重的战争创伤，为了重建更加美好的城市，德国人民又付出了多么大的劳动代价。
　　国家奖金获得者汉斯·巴尔莱的钢笔画“全世界的人民，伸出你们的手来！”以及“囚者之歌”，是为一九五一年在柏林举行的世界青年与学生联欢节的歌集所作的插图。前者是一幅呼吁和平的图画，表现了全世界人民的共同心愿，表现了全世界不同肤色、不同语言、不同信仰的各国人民在和平的旗帜下团结起来的友好精神。后一幅是非常有趣而有力的，描绘的是：东方的人力车夫（代表殖民地人民）把殖民统治者抛到垃圾堆里去了。他还有一幅标题为“‘天堂’里的孩子们”的炭笔画，表现了在美国被压迫的黑人孩子们的悲惨命运。巴尔莱的这些作品，通过生动活泼的艺术形象，表现了崇高的国际主义的思想感情。
　　库尔特·切默尔曼的组画“农民战争”是毛笔画，它表现了一五○○年左右发生于德国的农民战争。这一题材也曾被凯绥·珂勒惠支描绘过。因此，中国读者对于这些作品所表现的历史事件，是并不生疏的。
　　描绘风景的版画，在整个展览会中占了不少。木刻“暴风中的松树”的作者卡尔·亨纳曼·斯威林是现已七十一岁的老版画家，他的这个富有浪漫色彩的作品，使人感到是一首很美的抒情诗，画面流畅，刀法豪放，黑白色调所形成的旋律和整个图画健康而壮丽的情调，都很和谐。他的另一作品“草原之花”，是介乎风景和静物之间的一幅优美的抒情木刻。在这两幅木刻中，表现了艺术家对于自然的深刻的理解和美的感情。
    瓦尔特·克莱姆教授是这些展品的作者中最老的版画家，今年已七十二岁了，他的作品在德国享有很高的声望。在这个展览会上，有他的“小鹿”、“溜冰场”、“冬景”、“小鹤”等作品。“溜冰场”是彩色木刻，“冬景”是水墨画，都是很美的风景，巧妙地表现了冬天的景象，有特殊的风格。从“小鹿”和“小鹤”我们看出克莱姆对于这些小动物的爱，以及在表现小动物的生命和精神时高度现实主义的技巧。
    这次来我国访问的德国版画家赫尔倍特·托赫尔斯基，也有两幅腐蚀版画和两幅木刻画参加展览，描绘的都是德国的乡村、渔船、森林和工业区的风景。作品都有很高的技巧，有力而坚实，单纯而美丽，受到了很多中国版画家的喜爱。
    另外，还有贝尔恩哈特·克莱茨施玛教授和奥托·配兹的腐蚀版画和石版画的风景，以及汉斯—推渥·立希脱教授的石版画“姑娘和花”、“在画图的小孩们”，威尔纳·克莱姆凯的木刻——高尔基著“世界的痛苦”的插图，威廉·卡斯鲍姆的“撁牛”，库尔特·齐莫曼的“朝鲜的母亲”，可拉·克拉夫特的木刻“制篮者”，国家奖金获得者约瑟夫·赫肯巴尔特教授的“豹猫”等作品，都很优美，我不一一细谈了。
　　总的说来，德国的现代版画，表现力强，风格多样，坚实，有力，明确，简练，显明地表现了德国民族艺术的特点，这正是我国版画家们今天需要好好学习的。
