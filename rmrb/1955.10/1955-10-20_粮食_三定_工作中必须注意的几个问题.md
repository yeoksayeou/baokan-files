Several Issues That Must Be Noted in the Grain “Three Fixes” Work
He Wei

The work of fixing grain production, procurement, and sales nationwide has been launched in over 45,000 townships as of early and mid-September. These townships account for more than one-fifth of the total number of townships with “Three Fixes” tasks nationwide. It is estimated that over four-fifths of the townships with “Three Fixes” tasks nationwide will launch grain "Three Fixes" work in October. Therefore, October is the most intense and decisive month for the "Three Fixes" work; all localities must make the greatest effort to ensure the victorious completion of this mass movement.

I.

Judging from the situation of grain “Three Fixes” to the household level in various regions, the achievements of this work are significant, and the development of the movement is basically normal. In areas where the "Three Fixes" to the household level has been completed, the fixed grain production figures do not exceed the actual production, and the fixed procurement and sales figures are also fair and reasonable. For farmers' self-use grain, various localities have also left enough for farmers according to the local general consumption level, and the grain retention standards are generally higher than last year. The figures for procurement to the household level in various localities have increased or decreased compared with the figures for procurement to the township level in the spring, and the figures for sales to the household level have generally decreased compared with the figures for sales to the township level in the spring. Due to the demarcation of surplus and deficit grain, various localities have also separated the farmers' revolving grain for separate calculation. All places that have correctly implemented the various principles of the “Three Fixes” have clearly distinguished between surplus and deficit grain households in rural areas. This can avoid the phenomenon of “excessive” grain procurement and unreasonable supply caused by the failure to distinguish between surplus and deficit, thereby further implementing the policy of unified state purchase and sale of grain. The broad masses of farmers clearly see from the "Three Fixes" measures that grain purchase and sale are more reasonable, and they have a "bottom line" in their hearts, so they more enthusiastically support the national policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. As some farmers said: "With 'Three Fixes' to the township, the heart is bright; with 'Three Fixes' to the household, the heart is even more clear." In places where the "Three Fixes" policy is correctly implemented, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers to increase production and develop agricultural cooperatives has been unprecedentedly enhanced.

II.

However, saying that the development of the "Three Fixes" movement in the recent period is normal does not mean that there are no shortcomings in the work; it must be seen that there are still some problems, more or less, in the "Three Fixes" work in various regions, and some regions even have serious problems.

First, in many places, staff members have developed blindly optimistic emotions; because the tasks of developing agricultural cooperatives and other aspects are very heavy, some comrades are busy with the preparatory work for running cooperatives and are eager to transfer to the cooperativization movement. In grain work, there is a tendency to simply rush for time and ignore quality, which has caused a rough phenomenon in the "Three Fixes" work in some areas. For example, according to materials from various places, among the 2,542 townships in Jiangsu Province that have carried out the "Three Fixes" work, 350 townships have poor ideological mobilization and policy implementation, and various business tasks have not been done well, so it is necessary to make up for the lessons again. In Guangdong, 20% to 25% of the townships where the "Three Fixes" work has ended must also make up for the lessons again. In some areas of Zhejiang Province, the "Three Fixes" work of a township was "completed" in five, seven, or even three days, and the work was done quite roughly. If this phenomenon is not immediately prevented and eliminated, the grain "Three Fixes" work is in danger of slipping away.

Second, directly related to the above problems is that many staff members still have the idea of "emphasizing purchase and neglecting sales." Some places only pay attention to fixing production and fixing purchase, but do not seriously do a good job of fixing sales; some places simply distribute the purchase and sale figures allocated by the higher authorities to the lower levels, without seriously making purchase and sale closely integrated on the basis of determining actual production and clarifying surplus and deficit. If this tendency of "emphasizing purchase and neglecting sales" and the separation of purchase and sale is not corrected and prevented in time, the mistakes of the past will be repeated, and the grain work and even the entire rural work in the future will be in a passive and unfavorable position.

Third, many places have made the mistake of using tasks to impose production and procurement rates. The result of imposing unified purchase tasks on the lower levels is that the phenomenon of low production and small procurement rates has occurred. This has led to the problem of inconsistency between tasks and procurement rates, as well as the lack of unified procurement rates between townships and regions due to improper task allocation. If this problem is not addressed, even if the unified purchase tasks and procurement rates are small, it will cause dissatisfaction among farmers due to unfair allocation.

Fourth, in the "Three Fixes" work in many areas, various business tasks cannot keep up with the requirements of work development, which affects the consolidation of the "Three Fixes" work results and the effective control of grain purchase and sale.

III.

According to the experience of various places in carrying out the "Three Fixes" work, and according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the following issues must be effectively noted in the "Three Fixes" work to the household level.

First, it is necessary to implement the unified purchase and sale of grain on the basis of political mobilization. It must be recognized that if political mobilization is not fully carried out, even the best methods cannot be accepted by the broad masses of cadres and the masses. According to the experience of various places, in carrying out the "Three Fixes" work, it is necessary to do a good job of political mobilization from inside the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses. To this end, after the work is launched, the first step is to mobilize all Party members, League members, staff members, and activists (including people's representatives) in a township at all levels, so that these backbones not only understand the "Three Fixes" policies and methods, but also report their actual grain production and surplus grain quantity or deficit grain quantity. In this way, they can be relied upon to mobilize all farmers and correctly implement the "Three Fixes" methods to each farmer household.

Second, it is necessary to implement the principle of combining grain collection and purchase with sales and arranging them at the same time. Experience has shown that only by clearly dividing the boundaries between surplus and deficit grain, and simultaneously determining the four figures of public grain collection, unified grain purchase, unified sales, and necessary revolving grain purchase and sale according to the three different situations of surplus, self-sufficiency, and deficiency, can the phenomenon of purchasing "excessive grain" and improper supply be avoided. This method of combining purchase and sale and unified arrangement is an extremely important experience provided by two years of practice, but today, to truly achieve the combination of purchase and sale, it still requires a arduous effort.

The key to clarifying the boundaries between surplus and deficit and realizing the combination of purchase and sale lies in rationally assessing production and rationally stipulating the quantity of grain retained by farmers according to the local general consumption level. Therefore, production must be fixed in reality, and it is not allowed to exceed the actual production, it can be slightly lower than the actual production, but it should not be excessively lower than the actual production. If the fixed production exceeds the actual production, the phenomenon of purchasing "excessive grain" may occur; and if the fixed production is too low than the actual production, the false phenomenon of high purchase rate or low retention in form will occur. If someone uses this as an excuse to demand excessive grain supply in the future, we will not be able to explain it. It can be seen that it is very important to fix the production in reality.

In the "Three Fixes" work, various places also encountered such a problem, that is, how to unify the purchase rate with the task. The solution to this problem should be: on the premise of ensuring the completion of the overall task, stipulate a unified purchase rate with a region or county or a larger area as a unit, so that the purchase rate is generally balanced within this range. If the task is found to be too high or too low, it should be adjusted appropriately according to the specific situation. Since the national unified grain purchase task has been reduced a lot this year, and most areas have achieved bumper harvests, the unified purchase task in some places may exceed. On this issue, as long as the leadership does not subjectively require the lower levels to overfulfill the unified purchase task too much, but naturally exceeds it under the conditions of correctly implementing the policy, this is of course allowed.

Third, it is necessary to correctly handle the relationship between grain "Three Fixes" work and agricultural cooperativization. The task of developing agricultural cooperatives this winter and next spring is very heavy, and the high tide of the socialist mass movement in rural areas across the country is about to arrive. Facing this new situation, we must concentrate our efforts and quickly do a good job of the "Three Fixes" work, so as to timely transfer rural work to the cooperativization movement; if the "Three Fixes" work is delayed, it will affect the development of the cooperativization movement. According to the experience of some areas, the "Three Fixes" to the household level work of a township can be completed within 15 days, and at the latest, it should not exceed 20 days; complete a batch of townships, and then transfer to another batch of townships. In this way, a province can generally complete the work of grain "Three Fixes" to the household level and the collection of grain into the warehouse within three months. This means that we must quickly complete the "Three Fixes" work, but also ensure that the "Three Fixes" work is done well. If we simply rush for time and tasks, the phenomenon of sloppiness and roughness will inevitably occur in the work. As a result, the tense phenomenon of grain supply in rural areas may be re-triggered. At that time, we will have to be forced to use great strength to reverse this unfavorable situation; and if we do so, it will inevitably affect the progress of agricultural production and agricultural cooperativization. Doing a good job of cooperativization is the basis for solving the grain problem in the future, and doing a good job of the "Three Fixes" work is a prerequisite for smoothly doing a good job of cooperativization. In order to ensure that the "Three Fixes" work and cooperativization are not missed, it is required that all localities, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, mobilize sufficient forces within a limited time and focus all their attention on doing a good job of grain "Three Fixes" work.

Fourth, we must fully grasp the decisive link of unified sales. The grain "Three Fixes" work faces more than 100 million individual farmers. It is a very difficult task to arrange all aspects of grain work and establish a complete system in about three months. This requires the leading organs in various localities to first thoroughly solve the key problems, and secondary problems can be gradually solved later. Then, which key problem should be grasped in the "Three Fixes" work at present? According to the specific situation of this year's "Three Fixes" work, in addition to doing a good job in fixing production and fixing purchase, it is particularly necessary to fully grasp the link of fixing sales. Why should we especially emphasize fixing sales in both purchase and sale? This is because the unified purchase task has been reduced this year, and there is a bumper harvest, which is a favorable condition. As long as the production is fixed well, it is relatively easy to complete the task of fixing purchase (of course, we cannot therefore let go of the work of fixing purchase). The weakest link at present is fixing sales. This is not only because some staff members in some areas have not accepted the lessons of the past "emphasizing purchase and neglecting sales," but also because some staff members in some areas are only satisfied with the reduction in the planned sales figures, and have not spent the necessary effort to effectively fix the sales of grain deficit households. This shows that in the case of heavy tasks in all aspects of rural areas, the danger that the fixed sales work will be lightly squeezed out exists, and we must be very vigilant about this. In order to thoroughly solve the problem of fixing sales, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, before transferring from the "Three Fixes" work to the cooperativization work, we must effectively do two things: First, we must thoroughly find out the number of grain deficit households and the amount of grain deficit, not only to effectively grasp how many grain deficit households there are in each township and each village, but also to find out how much each household is in deficit and when they are in deficit. After the supply figures of grain deficit households are approved by the higher authorities, they should be compiled into a roster and distributed to the relevant units and grass-roots grain supply points for them to master so that they can be supplied on time according to the number. Second, we must hold two meetings well: one is a meeting of surplus grain households and self-sufficient households. In addition to reviewing the fixed purchase figures of surplus grain households at the meeting, the figures should be finalized after obtaining the consent of the surplus grain households, and policy education should also be carried out for surplus grain households and self-sufficient households to prevent them from blindly shouting for grain deficit in the future. On the other hand, we must also hold a meeting of grain deficit households. After obtaining the consent of the grain deficit households, the supply figures of each household should be determined. At the same time, we must educate them to increase production and practice thrift, and call on them to strive for grain self-sufficiency or even surplus in the future.

Fifth, in the "Three Fixes" work, we must also do a good job in grain business work (including statistics, registration, voucher management, etc.), especially to do a good job in the business work of unified sales in an orderly manner, so as to ensure the smooth progress of the "Three Fixes" work. The grain business work in some places is chaotic, resulting in hundreds of errors in the relevant figures for grain production, purchase, and sales, which has caused serious difficulties for the "Three Fixes" work. The Party and government leading organs in these areas should strictly supervise the "Three Fixes" staff and grain departments to improve business work, so that the above chaotic situation can be quickly corrected.

    粮食“三定”工作中必须注意的几个问题
    何畏
    全国的粮食定产、定购、定销的工作，截至九月上旬和中旬为止，已先后在四万五千多个乡展开，这些乡约占全国有“三定”任务的乡的总数的五分之一以上。预计十月份全国将有五分之四以上有“三定”任务的乡展开粮食“三定”工作。因此，十月份是“三定”工作最紧张和有决定意义的月份；各地必须为保证这一群众性运动的胜利完成而作最大的努力。一
    根据各地粮食“三定”到户的情况看，这一工作的成绩是显著的，运动的发展基本上是正常的。在完成“三定”到户工作的地区，粮食定产的数字都不超过实产量，定购、定销的数字也公平合理，对于农民的自用粮食，各地也根据当地一般消费水平给农民留够了，留粮标准一般都比去年高。各地定购到户的数字比春季定购到乡的数字有增有减，定销到户的数字，比春季定销到乡的数字普遍减少。由于划分了余粮缺粮的界限，各地对农民的周转粮也多划分出来单独计算。凡是正确地贯彻执行了“三定”的各项原则的地方，都做到把农村的余粮户和缺粮户明显地区别开来，这就可以避免由于余缺不分而产生的购粮“过头”和供应不合理的现象，从而进一步贯彻执行了粮食统购统销政策。广大农民从“三定”的措施中清楚地看到粮食购销更加合理，心中有了“底”，因而更加热烈地拥护国家粮食统购统销政策。正如有的农民所说的：“三定”到了乡，心里亮堂堂；“三定”到了户，心里更有数。在正确地贯彻执行“三定”政策的地方，广大农民的增加生产和发展农业合作社的积极性空前地提高了。二
    但是，说最近时期“三定”运动的发展是正常的，并不是说工作中就没有任何缺点了；必须看到，在各地的“三定”工作中都还或多或少地有一些问题，而且有些地区甚至有严重的问题。
    首先，在不少地方，由于工作人员滋长着盲目乐观的情绪；由于发展农业合作社的任务和其他方面的任务很重，有些同志忙于办社的准备工作和急于转入合作化运动，在粮食工作中有单纯赶时间、忽视质量的偏向，这就造成了某些地区的“三定”工作中的粗糙现象。例如，根据各地的材料，在江苏省已经进行过“三定”工作的二千五百四十二个乡中，有三百五十个乡思想发动和政策执行较差，各项业务工作也没有做好，因而必须重新补课。在广东
  “三定”工作已经结束的乡中也有百分之二十到二十五的乡必须重新补课。浙江省有的地区在五、七天甚至三天以内就把一个乡的“三定”工作“完成”了，工作作得相当粗糙。对于这种现象如果不立即防止和消除，粮食“三定”工作就有滑过去的危险。
    其次，同上述问题直接联系的是：由于不少工作人员仍然有“重购轻销”的思想，有些地方只注意了定产、定购，而没有认真做好定销工作；有些地方只是把上级分配的购销数字简单地向下面分配，而没有认真地在定实产量和划清余缺的基础上，使购销密切结合。这种“重购轻销”和购销脱节的偏向，如果不及时纠正和防止，将会使过去的错误重复发生，使今后粮食工作以至整个农村工作处于被动和不利的地位。
    第三，不少地方发生了用任务套产量、套购率的错误作法。把统购任务向下面硬套的结果，就发生了产量偏低、购率偏小的现象。这就发生了任务和购率不一致以及由于任务分配不当而产生的各乡各区之间购率不统一的问题。这个问题如果不注意解决，即使统购任务、购率是小的，也会因为分配不公平而引起农民的不满。
    第四，在许多地区的“三定”工作中，各项业务工作，跟不上工作发展的要求，以致影响“三定”工作成果的巩固和粮食购销的有效控制。三
    根据各地进行“三定”工作的经验，根据党中央和国务院的指示，在“三定”到户的工作中，必须切实注意下述几个问题。
    第一，必须在政治动员的基础上，贯彻执行粮食统购统销的办法。必须认识，如果不充分地进行政治动员工作，办法再好也还是不能为广大干部和群众所接受。根据各地的经验，在开展“三定”工作中，必须从党内到党外，从干部到群众，做好政治动员工作。为此，在工作展开以后，首先要把一个乡的全体党员、团员、工作人员和积极分子（包括人民代表）层层发动起来，使这些骨干不但懂得“三定”政策和办法，而且把自己的粮食产量和余粮数量或缺粮数量报实。这样就可以依靠他们去发动全体农民，把“三定”办法正确地贯彻到各个农户。
    第二，必须贯彻执行粮食征、购同销售结合进行和同时安排的原则。经验证明，只有把余粮缺粮的界限划分清楚，并根据有余、自给和不足这三种不同情况，把公粮征收、粮食统购、统销和必需的周转粮购销四种数字同时确定下来，才能避免购“过头粮”和供应不当的现象发生。这种购销结合、统一安排的方法，是两年来实践所提供的一个极其重要的经验，但是，在今天说来，要真正作到购销结合，仍然要经过一个艰苦努力的过程。
    划清余缺界限和实现购销结合的关键，在于合理地评定产量和根据当地一般消费水平合理地规定农民留用粮食的数量。因此，产量必须定实，不准超过实产量，可以略低于实产量，但也不要过分地低于实产量。如果定产量超过实产量，就可能发生购“过头粮”的现象；而如果定产量过多地低于实产量，就会发生在形式上看来购率高或留量低的虚假现象，如果将来有人以此为借口过多地要求供应粮食，我们就无法解释。可见把产量定实，是非常重要的。
    在“三定”工作中各地还碰到这样一个问题，就是如何使购率同任务统一的问题。解决这个问题的办法应该是：在保证完成总的任务的前提下，以区或县或更大的区域为单位，规定一个统一的购率，使购率在这个范围内大体平衡。发现任务偏高偏低的情况，应根据具体情况进行适当的调整。由于今年全国粮食统购任务减轻较多，绝大部分地区又获得丰收，有些地方的统购任务可能超过。在这个问题上，只要领导方面不是主观地要求下边过多地超额完成统购任务，而是在正确执行政策的条件下自然有所超过，这当然是允许的。
    第三，必须正确地处理粮食“三定”工作同农业合作化的关系。今冬明春发展农业合作社的任务很大，全国农村社会主义群众运动的高潮将要到来。面临着这一新形势，我们必须集中力量，迅速把“三定”工作做好，以便及时把农村工作转入合作化运动；如果“三定”工作推迟了，就会影响合作化运动的开展。根据某些地区的经验，一个乡的“三定”到户的工作，可以争取在十五天内完成，最迟不得超过二十天；完成一批乡，再转到另一批乡。这样分批展开，一个省大体上可以在三个月内把粮食的“三定”到户和征购粮食入库的工作完成。这就是说，既要迅速完成“三定”工作，又要保证做好“三定”工作。如果单纯为了赶时间赶任务，工作中必然要发生草率粗糙的现象，其结果，就可能重新引起农村粮食供应的紧张现象，那时我们就不得不被迫用极大的力量，来扭转这种不利的局面；而如果这样做，就必然要影响到农业生产和农业合作化工作的进展。搞好合作化是今后解决粮食问题的基础，而搞好“三定”工作又是顺利搞好合作化的前提。为了要使“三定”工作和合作化两不误，就要求各地在党委统一领导下，在限定的时间内，动员足够的力量，全神贯注地做好粮食“三定”工作。
    第四，必须全力抓住统销这一决定的环节。粮食“三定”工作面对着一亿多个体农户，要想在大约三个月的时间内把粮食工作的各方面都安排好，并建立一套完整无缺的制度，这是一件很困难的事情。这就要求各地领导机关首先把关键性的问题彻底解决，至于次要的问题可留在以后逐步解决。那末在“三定”工作中，目前应该抓住哪个关键问题呢？根据今年“三定”工作的具体情况，除了必须把定产、定购工作做好以外，特别需要全力抓住定销这一环节。为什么在购销两方面要特别强调定销呢？这是因为今年统购任务已经减轻，又有丰收这个有利条件，只要产量定好，完成定购的任务是比较容易的（当然也不能因此对定购工作放任自流）。目前最薄弱的环节是定销，这不仅因为有些地区的工作人员还没有接受过去“重购轻销”的教训，而且因为有些地区的工作人员只满足于销售计划数字的减少，而没有花费必要的力量把缺粮户的销量切实固定下来。这说明，在农村各方面的任务都很繁重的情况下，定销工作被轻轻挤掉的危险，是存在着的，对此我们必须十分警惕。为了彻底解决定销问题，根据党中央和国务院的指示，在从“三定”工作向合作化工作转移以前，必须切实做好两件事情：第一，必须把缺粮户数和缺粮数量彻底弄清楚，不但要切实掌握每个乡每个村缺粮户有多少，而且要弄清楚每个户缺多少，以及什么时候缺。缺粮户的供应数字经过上级批准后，编成名册，分给有关单位及基层粮食供应点掌握，以便照数按时供应。第二，必须开好两个会：一个是余粮户和自足户的会，在会上除了要把余粮户的定购数字复查一下，在取得余粮户同意后把数字最后确定下来以外，还要对余粮户、自足户进行政策教育，使他们今后不再盲目地叫喊缺粮。另一方面还要开好缺粮户会议，在取得缺粮户的同意后把每户的供应数字都确定下来，同时要向他们进行增产节约的教育，号召他们争取今后粮食自给以至有余。
    第五，在“三定”工作中，还必须做好粮食业务工作（包括统计、注册、凭证管理等），特别要有条不紊地做好统销方面的业务工作，以便保证“三定”工作顺利进行。有些地方的粮食业务工作混乱，致使有关粮食定产、定购、定销的数字差错百出，给“三定”工作造成了严重的困难。这些地区的党政领导机关应严格督促“三定”工作人员和粮食部门，改进业务工作，使上述混乱情况迅速得到纠正。
