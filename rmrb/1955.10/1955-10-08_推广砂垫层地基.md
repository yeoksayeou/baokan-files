    Promoting Sand Cushion Foundations
    Li Shengting Zheng Faxue
    In 1954, the Northeast Second Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering successfully tested the use of sand cushion foundations by learning from advanced Soviet experience. The sand cushion foundation involves excavating a weak soil layer to a certain depth under the foundation of a building, filling it with layers of sand, and compacting it with water. This is a simple and economical method for cushioning foundations, suitable for the foundations of general civil buildings.

    Currently, when building houses and encountering ground with insufficient soil firmness, the common practice is to excavate the soil to a great depth and then build concrete or rubble foundations on top, which wastes a lot of raw materials. Using sand cushion foundations allows the foundation to be buried shallower, thereby reducing the volume of the foundation and saving raw materials such as cement and stone. According to the experience of the Second Engineering Company of the Northeast Construction Engineering Bureau, using sand cushion foundations can save 50% each of cement and stone materials, and the cost of the entire foundation can be reduced by more than 30%. Last year, the company used sand cushion foundations in thirteen houses, saving a total of 600 tons of cement, saving approximately 130,000 yuan.

    The use of sand cushion foundations can also shorten the settlement time after the completion of the house and prevent the rise of groundwater, ensuring the quality of the project.

    The use of sand cushion foundations must strictly adhere to the operating procedures, and special attention should be paid to the following issues: First, the particle size of the sand must meet the regulations, and the sand should not contain too much clay. Second, each layer of sand should not be too thick, preferably 15 cm or 20 cm. Third, the amount of water poured should be appropriate, and the tamping work should be carried out in a certain direction. It is essential to ensure that the tamping is solid and uniform, otherwise, it may cause uneven settlement of the building, affecting the quality of the project.

    推广砂垫层地基  
    李圣庭　郑法学
    一九五四年，建筑工程部东北第二工程公司学习苏联先进经验，试用砂垫层地基成功。砂垫层地基是把建筑物基础下一定深度的弱土层挖去，分层填上砂子，洒水夯实。这是一种简便经济的垫地基办法，适用于一般民用建筑物的基础。
    现在一般建筑房屋一遇到土质不够坚固的地面时，就挖去很深的土，然后在上面打混凝土或毛石地基，要浪费很多原料。采用砂垫层地基可使基础埋置得浅一些，从而缩小基础的体积，节约水泥、石块等原料。东北建筑工程局第二工程公司的经验，采用砂垫层地基能节约水泥和石料各百分之五十，整个基础的造价可节约百分之三十以上。这个公司去年在十三幢房屋中采用了砂垫层地基，共节约了水泥六百吨，节约金额约十三万元。
    采用砂垫层地基还可以缩短房屋建成后的下沉时间和防止地下水的上升，保证工程质量。
    采用砂垫层地基必须严格遵守操作规程，并应该特别注意以下几个问题：第一、砂的粒径必须合乎规定，砂中不能含有过多的黏土。第二、每层砂不能过厚，最好是十五公分或二十公分。第三、浇水量要适宜，打夯工作要按一定方向进行，一定要保证夯实夯匀，否则就可能使建筑物沉陷不均匀，影响工程质量。
