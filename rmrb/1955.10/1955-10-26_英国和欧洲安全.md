    Britain and European Security
    By V. Trukhanovsky, Soviet Union
    Maintaining and consolidating peace in Europe is one of the most pressing issues currently concerning the British public. In Britain, this extreme concern is entirely justified. Historical experience, economic, political, geographical, and strategic reasons all demonstrate that Britain has a fundamental stake in establishing a reliable European security system and in maintaining and consolidating peace on the European continent.
    For more than three hundred years before World War I, Britain's security mainly relied on its island status and its fleet's command of the seas. The English Channel separated Britain from the continent. The western part of the Channel is more than one hundred miles wide, while the eastern part, connecting to the North Sea, is nineteen miles wide. Before the early twentieth century, this channel was a reliable defense for Britain against any military threat from the European continent. Britain had participated in many continental disputes, but it limited itself to providing financial and diplomatic support to its allies, building its European policy on the famous principle of "balance of power."
    However, these conditions were only effective before 1914. World War I completely changed this situation. The appearance of submarines in the armaments of some countries reduced the significance of the British fleet in ensuring national security. The emergence of the air force greatly reduced the significance of the English Channel as a factor of British security. Cole wrote in his "Military Geography of the Empire," published in 1936:
    "London is less than an hour's flight from the European coast... Its area is twice as large as Berlin and twice as large as Paris; its population accounts for a much larger proportion of the British population than Berlin and Paris account for in Germany and France; its Thames River is an ideal landmark for airplanes; its fragmented cloud conditions favor the attacking side."
    These conditions indicate that naval hegemony alone is no longer sufficient for Britain's security. Financial and diplomatic support for allies on the continent is also not enough. To achieve victory in World War I—or, more precisely, to avoid a serious defeat—Britain had to build a massive army and put it into battle against the enemy. This army suffered unprecedented losses in British history.
    British deaths totaled 743,000, and the number of wounded was 1,693,000. The situation of the masses of people in the rear was very difficult, and the standard of living declined sharply. Only the monopoly capitalists, who to a considerable extent ignited the flames of war and provided munitions for the war, made a fortune: the profits of British industry during the war years greatly exceeded pre-war levels.
    Britain and its allies achieved victory in World War I, but, as noted in the publication of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, "British Foreign Policy, Strategy and Economics," it paid a "terrible price" for the victory. World War I sharply weakened Britain, and it lagged behind in terms of industrial development. Its foreign trade suffered serious losses. As a result of the war, Britain had to cede its leadership in international finance to the United States. The status of its colonial empire was also seriously weakened. Most notably, it lost its naval advantage: the principle of Britain's "two-power standard" in the past, that is, the strength of the British fleet should be at least equal to the standard of the world's two strongest fleets, has become a thing of the past.
    In short, World War I undermined Britain's international position. The London "Times" wrote in 1943:
    "The victory of 1918 created a strong and safe illusion... In fact, the war of 1914-1918 accelerated the relative weakening of Britain in the ranks of world powers."
    World War II brought even greater threats and more serious losses to Britain. In the early stages of the war, Britain was close to defeat, close to the real collapse of the entire country. In May 1945, the London "Economist" magazine wrote:
    "Even in these days when we can breathe freely again, it still makes us shudder to recall how extremely narrow and close we were to the edge of death."
    At the end of this most serious war, Britain was, after all, among the victors, primarily because the Soviet Union was one of its allies. This fact has been repeatedly acknowledged in the statements of representatives of the British ruling group. General Ian Jacob, who served as Assistant to the Military Advisor to the British War Cabinet from 1939 to 1946—and who was certainly very familiar with the British military situation at the time—wrote:
    "If Russia had been defeated in 1941... it is doubtful whether Britain could have survived even with the support of the entire Commonwealth and the United States."
    World War II further weakened Britain. In the initial years after the war, it was in a position of economic dependence on the United States. Most of its foreign investments were lost, national debt rose sharply, and payment deficits became a regular phenomenon. Britain's role in international affairs was greatly reduced.
    The war once again brought huge burdens and suffering to the British people. As in World War I, only a small group of monopoly capitalists who made money by supplying munitions benefited. According to British press materials, company profits rose from £1,235 million in 1938 to £2,325 million in 1945.
    Therefore, the experience of the twentieth century proves that wars on the European continent pose the most serious threat to Britain. Although Britain was a victor in both World Wars, the wars brought it blows so heavy that it could hardly fully recover. All of this most clearly shows that Britain's national interests urgently require the maintenance of peace in Europe. Facts prove that Britain's security can only be guaranteed by establishing a reliable system for maintaining peace on the European continent.
    If European security was of vital interest to the British people in the past, then this interest is even greater now. Fair opinion in British public circles believes that war is the most serious danger to the existence of their country.
    General Jacob, mentioned above, pointed out in his article "Principles of British Military Thought" (1951) that it is doubtful whether Britain is currently capable of making the same kind of military effort as in the last war. Two factors must be considered. The first factor, in his opinion, is that Britain cannot develop a wartime economy while raising funds to pay for the import of necessary raw materials and food. Jacob believes with good reason that Britain cannot solve this problem alone in the event of war, "there must be a Lend-Lease Act or something equivalent." General Jacob believes that the second factor that creates Britain's rather questionable future in a future war is its geographical location.
    "Can Britain withstand bombing? It will probably be bombed, and it is very likely to be bombed, including with atomic bombs and long-range rockets." He raises this question. At the same time, he immediately points out that this question is highly debatable, but "no one can answer it with certainty."
    Now this question is no longer a matter of debate. In the period since Jacob's opinion was published, many people in Britain have understood all the profound dangers that a new war harbors for Britain. British physicist Powell, Vice President of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, wrote at the beginning of 1955:
    "Countries with dense populations and complex economic and social structures, such as our country and some other countries in Western Europe, are particularly vulnerable to damage from hydrogen bomb attacks."
    This means that provoking a European war under modern conditions is a truly fatal blow to Britain. Precisely because of this, the issue of maintaining European security is now an extremely acute issue for the British people. How to guarantee Britain's security?——This question should naturally become the leading question of British national policy. Naturally, there are different answers to this question.
    Some politicians and commentators in Britain like to say that Britain's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union can fully guarantee the country's security and help maintain world peace. However, these arguments are very inconsistent with the facts.
    First of all, historical experience indicates that the establishment of military blocs in Europe has never led to peace, but to war. Did not the establishment of the Triple Alliance headed by Germany and the Entente participated in by Britain, France, and Russia lead to World War I? Did the establishment of the German, Italian, and Japanese groups on one side and the British and French groups on the other side in the 1930s avoid World War II? Finally, if we look at the present, what is the reason for the current international tension other than the establishment of opposing military blocs by Western countries? The past and the present have very clearly proved that the establishment of military blocs is not a path towards guaranteeing European peace. From this, it can also be concluded that these blocs cannot guarantee Britain's national security.
    However, even if we do not talk about the future, we cannot but point out that Britain's participation in Western military blocs has already presented it with many very serious questions directly related to its security.
    One result of Britain's participation in military blocs is that it must engage in an arms race unprecedented in history. This arms race is destructive to its economy and leads to a decline in people's living standards. Some groups in Britain attempt to portray the arms race as a means of strengthening peace. But in fact, nothing is further from the task of strengthening universal peace than the arms race—which is the most important part of the "position of strength" policy. In Britain, many people have understood this clearly in the past and present. It is appropriate to quote the statement of Sir Grey, who served as British Foreign Secretary on the eve of World War I:
    "The lesson of European history is clear. This lesson is that it is impossible to guarantee solid security by means of an arms race and the conclusion of separate alliances."
    Another British Foreign Secretary (1929-1931), Arthur Henderson, wrote in 1930:
    "This attempt by every country to be stronger than its neighbors... has always caused wars in the past and will always cause wars in the future."
    Therefore, Britain's massive expansion plan is the inevitable result of its participation in military blocs, and this not only cannot serve as a guarantee of national security, but in fact undermines this security.
    Another result of Britain's participation in military blocs that damages its national security interests is the distribution of American military bases on its territory. Some politicians insist that these bases are also effective means of defending Britain and world peace. However, the reality is far from this.
    Britain's permission to establish American air force bases equipped with atomic bombers on its territory puts itself in a position where it will immediately be on the front line in the event of war. What does this actually mean for Britain? A senior American general revealed the answer to this question in a conversation, saying that if a war were to occur, "even if London and most of Britain were quickly destroyed, Britain would still be useful as an aircraft carrier for American bombers."
    There may not be anyone in Britain who would like this prospect! American military bases, as products of the policy of establishing exclusive military blocs, are not means of strengthening but of undermining British security.
    Finally, and particularly importantly, this strategy of establishing Western military blocs is entirely based on the revival of German militarism. What aggressive German militarism is, the British people, like the people of all European countries, know very well. The revival of German militarism is a fatal danger to Britain's national interests.
    In short, the establishment of exclusive military blocs does not guarantee European security in the slightest. These blocs themselves, the arms race, the establishment of foreign military bases on other countries' territories, and the revival of German militarism produced by this policy of establishing military blocs all lead to the destruction of European security. At the same time, all of this poses a fatal threat to Britain's security.
    So, what is the way out? Where is the path towards guaranteeing European security? Where is the method of defending the security of all European countries, including Britain?
    These questions have already been answered in the proposals on the establishment of a European collective security system put forward by the Soviet delegation at the Geneva Four-Power Summit. First, the Soviet proposals guarantee the establishment of a reliable European collective security system that takes into account the interests of all European countries. Second, these proposals clear the way for solving many other outstanding international issues, primarily the German issue. Therefore, the concern of the broad British public for the Soviet proposals is understandable.
    The British people's fervent hope for consolidating European peace is manifested in the widespread support for the results of the Geneva Conference in Britain. Conservative MP Busby believes that the Geneva Conference is "a great victory for the moral forces of the world, which will exert increasing pressure on all governments in favor of the cause of peace."
    It was precisely because of the influence of the "moral forces" of the British people that the British delegation in Geneva—as was the French delegation—felt it necessary to put forward some proposals aimed at strengthening European peace. British Prime Minister Eden declared at the Geneva Conference that the British delegation would support all proposals that lead to increasing trust between European countries on the issue of security guarantees. Eden himself proposed a convention with the participation of Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, France, and a unified Germany, and at the same time stated that he was prepared to consider the issue of increasing the number of participating countries in the convention. He also proposed the deployment of inspection groups appointed by both sides in certain areas on both sides of the dividing line between East and West.
    The Geneva Four-Power Summit has contributed to the cause of European security. Specific and effective methods for resolving the European security issue remain to be sought at the Soviet, American, British, and French Foreign Ministers' Conference, which opened on October 27. Seeking such methods is in the fundamental interests of the British and other countries' people. In Britain, people are increasingly clearly understanding this point. Broad sections of the British people support the establishment of a European security system. The many remarks in favor of strengthening European peace in some major British newspapers are a reflection of this sentiment. For example, "The Times" said in an editorial published for the discussion of the results of the Geneva Conference by the Third Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union:
    "At first glance, it seems that Marshal Bulganin and Eden are getting closer and closer to each other on the issue of the European security convention... If this is the case, the results of the October Foreign Ministers' Conference will be expected to reach an agreement. Reconciliation is indeed possible. Everyone should expect this and promote this. Such a convention would be the foundation for greater stability and trust in Europe."
    Many other British newspapers also expressed their opinions in the same spirit. For example, "Reynolds News" called for turning Britain's policy towards abolishing the existing military blocs and replacing them with a universal security system.
    Naturally, there are still some influential forces in Britain that are trying by every means to hinder the reaching of an agreement on European security. Under the influence of those groups who believe that continuing the "Cold War" and the policy of national militarization are beneficial to themselves, some articles attempting to hinder the easing of international tensions have appeared in the British press. Some British newspapers have tried their best to spread pessimistic predictions about the future development of international relations.
    The British press is paying great attention to the German issue—an issue closely related to guaranteeing Britain's security. Everyone knows that some British newspapers are trying to prove that it seems that the entire Germany joining the Western military blocs is in line with the interests of strengthening European peace. At the same time, they are either deliberately avoiding or leaving to the future the solution of important issues such as the establishment of a European collective security system, so as to "try" to reach an agreement after a unified Germany has already joined the Western military blocs. "The Spectator" magazine follows this policy, and this magazine expresses the position of Western countries in an editorial as follows: "First restore German unity."
    However, this is putting the cart before the horse. Currently, the desire expressed by some groups in Britain to unify Germany in this way, that is, a unified Germany should become a participant in the Western military blocs, certainly has nothing in common with the interests of strengthening European peace. "Reynolds News" emphasized this situation when it believed: "The issue of a unified Germany should not become such an obstacle: all other hopes for peace will be dashed when they encounter it," and the hope of establishing a European security system is of course included.
    Cooperation between the Soviet Union and Britain is an important factor in guaranteeing European peace. This cooperation will become a reliable guarantee for preventing new war threats in this most important region of the world and for ensuring that the security of Britain and other countries is not threatened.
    World War II particularly convincingly proved the significance of Anglo-Soviet cooperation for the cause of European peace. "The Times" wrote in 1945, evaluating the significance of cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union for the cause of peace and the fundamental interests of the two countries: The important foundation of British foreign policy "is the alliance with Russia, which is a necessary condition for achieving victory in the war... Just as victory is the product of joint efforts, the continued maintenance of this joint effort is the reliable and practically possible foundation for solid European coordination. When Britain and Russia both safeguard peace on their own, and when unbreakable trust and cooperation are established between them, European peace will be guaranteed. If Britain and Russia abandon each other, then the future will be dark not only for the whole of Europe, but also for these two great powers... Neither Britain nor Russia, if they are unwilling to bring serious damage to their own national interests and the general interests of Europe, should be happy to do so: they must not allow themselves to adopt even short-term policies of division and disagreement." Indeed, the past experience of Anglo-Soviet relations clearly proves that in those periods when Britain acted jointly with the Soviet Union, Britain's security was best guaranteed; conversely, in those periods when the good relations between the two countries were undermined, Britain's interests always suffered losses. Unfortunately, the development of relations between Britain and the Soviet Union in the post-war period has been not as the interests of the two countries and the interests of European peace require. Britain's participation in military blocs aimed at opposing the Soviet Union has brought no small harm to the cause of European security. The mutual interests of Britain and the Soviet Union in maintaining peace are of far greater significance than the issues of contention that currently exist between the two countries. Britain also recognizes this point.
    The Soviet delegation took certain steps to promote relations with Britain at the Geneva Four-Power Summit, which was unanimously supported by the Soviet and British people. The Soviet delegation and British Prime Minister Eden held discussions on the ways and methods of consolidating relations between the Soviet Union and Britain. N. A. Bulganin and N. S. Khrushchev accepted Mr. Eden's invitation to visit Britain, which was unanimously approved at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The Soviet government believes that developing personal contacts between senior officials is of great significance for improving Anglo-Soviet relations. During the informal discussions between the Soviet delegation and Eden in Geneva, the issue of organizing mutual visits by naval fleets and military delegations was discussed in good faith. After the Geneva Conference, negotiations began between the Soviet Union and Britain on the issue of developing cultural cooperation. The number of British delegations coming to the Soviet Union has increased, and the number of Soviet delegations going to Britain has also increased; many British trade unions and sports delegations, as well as representatives of British cities, have visited Moscow. The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union hold friendly feelings towards the British people. London Mayor Howard, who visited Moscow this July, stated: "What touched me most was that all Russians hope for peace and hope to cooperate with the people of other countries." The Soviet people know that most British people are also friendly to our country. ××× It is of vital interest to the British people to reliably guarantee European security. The broad British public has been actively fighting for European peace throughout the post-war period. In this regard, they have received the support of the Soviet Union and the people of all countries, because guaranteeing European peace is one of the decisive conditions for preventing war anywhere in the world.

    英国和欧洲安全
    苏联  维·特鲁哈诺夫斯基
    维护和巩固欧洲的和平，是目前使英国公众感到不安的最迫切的问题之一。在英国，对这个问题的极其关心是完全合理的。历史的经验，经济、政治、地理和战略上的理由，都证明英国对建立可靠的欧洲安全体系，对维护和巩固欧洲大陆上的和平都是有着根本的利害关系的。
    在第一次世界大战以前的三百多年期间，英国的安全主要是依靠它的岛国地位和它的舰队掌握了海洋的霸权。英吉利海峡把英国同大陆分开。海峡的西部宽在一百英里以上，而东部接连北海的地方宽为十九英里。二十世纪初期以前，这个海峡是英国避免来自欧陆的任何军事威胁的可靠防御物。英国曾参与多次大陆纠纷，但它只限于对自己的同盟者给以财政上和外交上的支持，把自己的欧洲政策建筑在有名的“均势”原则上。
    然而这种条件只在一九一四年以前发生作用。第一次世界大战完全改变了这种局势。潜水艇在一些国家军备中的出现，降低了英国舰队在保障国家安全方面的意义。空军的产生大大减低了作为英国安全因素的英吉利海峡的意义。考尔在一九三六年出版的“帝国的军事地理”一书中曾写道：
    “伦敦距欧洲海岸用不了一小时的飞行……它的面积比柏林大一倍，比巴黎大两倍；它的人口比起柏林和巴黎在德国和法国所占的比例来，在英国人口中所占的比例要大得多；它的泰晤士河是飞机的理想的方向标；它的碎裂的云层的气象条件有利于进攻的一方。”
    这些条件表明仅只海上的霸权对于英国的安全已经是不够了。对于大陆上的同盟者作财政和外交上的支持也不够了。为了在第一次世界大战中获得胜利——或者说得更确切些，为了避免严重的失败——英国不得不建立一支庞大的陆军并使它投入对敌的战斗。这支军队曾遭受了英国历史上前所未有的损失。
    英国阵亡人数为七十四万三千，受伤人数为一百六十九万三千。后方人民群众的状况是非常艰苦的，生活水平急剧下降。只有那些在不小的程度上点燃了战火并为战争提供军火的垄断资本发了大财：英国工业的利润在战争年代中大大超过了战前水平。
    英国同它的同盟者在第一次世界大战中获得了胜利，但是，正如英国皇家国际关系学会的出版物
  “联合王国外交政策、战略和经济”中所指出的，它为胜利支付了“可怕的代价”。第一次世界大战急剧地削弱了英国，在工业发展方面它是落后了。它的对外贸易受到严重损失。战争的结果，英国在国际金融方面的领导地位不得不让给美国。它的殖民国家的地位也严重削弱了。最突出的是，它丧失掉海军的优势：过去英国的“两强标准”原则，即英国舰队的实力至少要等于世界上其他两个最强舰队的标准的原则，已经成为历史陈迹了。
    总之，第一次世界大战破坏了英国的国际地位。伦敦“泰晤士报”在一九四三年写道：
    “一九一八年的胜利造成了一种强大和安全的错觉……实际上，一九一四——一九一八年的战争加速了英国在世界强国行列中的相对的削弱。”
    第二次世界大战给英国带来了更大的威胁和更严重的损失。在战争的初期，英国就接近了失败，接近于真正的整个国家的覆灭。一九四五年五月，伦敦“经济学家”杂志写道：
    “甚至在现在我们又能自由呼吸的这些日子里，回忆起来仍要全身战栗，我们距死亡的边沿曾是怎样万分狭窄和接近啊。”
    在这场最严重的战争结束时，英国毕竟站在胜利者之列了，这首先因为苏联是它的同盟者之一。在英国统治集团代表人物的声明中，曾多次承认这个事实。一九三九至一九四六年任英国战时内阁军事顾问助理的伊安·雅各布将军——他当然是一个很熟悉当时英国军事情况的人——曾写道：
    “如果一九四一年俄国遭到了失败……即使有整个联邦和美国的支持，英国是否能生存是值得怀疑的。”
    第二次世界大战进一步削弱了英国。战后的最初几年，它就处于在经济上依赖美国的地位。它的国外投资的大部分都失掉了，国家债务急剧上升，支付赤字成了经常的现象。英国在国际事务中的作用大大降低了。
    战争又重新给英国人民带来了巨大的重担和痛苦。也如第一次世界大战一样，只有一小撮靠供应军火赚钱的垄断资本家获得了利益。根据英国报刊的材料，公司利润从一九三八年的十二亿三千五百万英镑上升到一九四五年的二十三亿二千五百万英镑。
    因此，二十世纪的经验证明，在欧洲大陆上发生的战争对英国是最严重的威胁。虽然在两次世界大战中英国都是战胜者，战争却给它带来了沉重到难以完全恢复的地步的打击。这一切都最清楚不过地说明：英国的民族利益迫切要求维护欧洲的和平。事实证明，只有在欧洲大陆上建立了可靠的维护和平的体系，英国的安全才会有保障。
    如果说，在过去，欧洲安全对于英国人民有着切身的利害关系，那末，在现在，这种利害关系就更大了。英国舆论界公正的意见认为，战争是对于他们国家存在的一个最严重的危险。
    上边谈到过的雅各布将军在“英国军事思想的原则”一文（一九五一年）中指出，英国现时是否有能力做出像上次大战中那样的军事努力，是值得怀疑的。必须考虑到两个因素。第一个因素，根据他的意见，是英国不能在发展战时经济的同时来筹措资金支付输入必要的原料和粮食的费用。雅各布很有根据地认为，在战争的情况下，英国独自是不能解决这个问题的，“必须有租借法案或与此相等的东西”。雅各布将军认为，在未来的战争中，造成英国的颇成问题的前途的第二个因素，是它的地理位置。
    “英国能不能经得住轰炸呢？大概它会受到轰炸，而且很可能受到包括原子弹和远射程火箭在内的轰炸。”他提出这个问题。同时他立即指出，这个问题大可争论，但是“任何人也不能有把握地加以回答”。
    现在这个问题已经不是争论的问题了。在雅各布的意见发表后的这段时间中，英国已有许多人明白了新战争对英国所孕育着的全部深重危险。英国著名物理学家鲍威尔，世界科学工作者协会副主席，在一九五五年年初曾写道：
    “像我国和西欧某些其他国家这样人口稠密、经济和社会结构体系复杂的国家，是特别容易受到氢弹的袭击的损伤的。”
    这就是说，在现代条件下挑起欧洲战争，对英国说来，是真正致命的打击。正因为这一点，维护欧洲安全的问题现在对英国人是一个异常尖锐的问题。怎样保证英国的安全呢？——这个问题自然应该成为英国国家政策的主导问题。自然，对这个问题也有着不同的回答。
    英国的某些政治家和评论员喜欢说，似乎英国参加北大西洋公约和西欧联盟能充分保障国家的安全并有助于维护世界和平。但是，这些论调是非常不符事实的。
    首先，历史的经验指出，在欧洲建立军事集团从来未曾导向和平，而是导向战争。当年建立的以德国为首的三国同盟和英、法、俄参加的协约国，难道不是引起了第一次世界大战吗？在三十年代建立的一方是德、意、日集团，一方是英、法集团，难道避免了第二次世界大战吗？最后，如果看看现在，导致目前国际紧张局势的原因不是西方国家建立对立的军事集团又是什么呢？过去和现在都十分确凿地证明，建立军事集团不是走向保障欧洲和平的道路。从此也可以得出这样的结论：这些集团也不能保障英国的国家安全。
    但是，即使不谈将来，也不能不指出，现在英国参加西方国家军事集团，已经在它面前提出了许多非常严重的直接关系到它的安全的问题。
    英国参加军事集团的一个结果是，它须进行历史上空前的军备竞赛，这种军备竞赛对它的经济起着破坏作用并导致人民生活水平的降低。英国的某些集团企图把军备竞赛说成是加强和平的手段。但是事实上，没有比军备竞赛——它是“实力地位”政策的最重要部分——距离加强普遍和平的任务更远的了。在英国，许多人过去和现在都清楚地明白这一点。这里引用曾在第一次世界大战前夕任英国外交大臣的格雷子爵的声明是适宜的：
    “欧洲历史的教训是清楚的。这种教训就是用军备竞赛和缔结分立的联盟的办法不可能保证巩固的安全。”
    另一个英国外交大臣（一九二九年——一九三一年）阿瑟·汉德逊在一九三○年写道：
    “每一个国家都想比它的邻国更强大的这种企图……无论过去和将来总是引起战争。”
    因而，英国庞大的扩军计划是它参加军事集团的必然结果，而这不仅不能作为国家安全的保证，事实上还在破坏这种安全。
    英国参加军事集团损害它的国家安全利益的另一个结果，是美国的军事基地分布在它的领土上。某些政治家硬说这些基地也是保卫英国和世界安全的有效手段。但是，实际上远非如此。
    英国允许在自己的领土上建立配置有原子轰炸机的美国空军基地，就使自己处于这样的地位：一旦发生战争，英国便立刻处于最前线。这对于英国实际上意味着什么呢？一位美国高级将领在一次谈话中曾透露过这一问题的答案，他说，如果一旦发生战争，“即使伦敦和英国的大部分很快地被毁灭，英国作为美国轰炸机的航空母舰毕竟还是有用的”。
    在英国未必有谁会喜欢这种前景吧！作为建立排外的军事集团政策的产物的美国军事基地，不是加强、而是破坏英国安全的手段。
    最后，也是特别重要的一点是，这种建立西方国家军事集团的战略完全是以复活德国军国主义为其基础的。侵略性的德国军国主义是什么，英国人民也像所有欧洲国家的人民一样知道得很清楚。复活德国军国主义对于英国的国家利益是致命的危险。
    总之，建立排他的军事集团丝毫也不能保证欧洲的安全。这些集团本身、军备竞赛、在他国领土上建立外国军事基地以及由这种建立军事集团政策所产生的德国军国主义的复活，这一切都导致着欧洲安全的破坏。同时，这一切也对英国的安全形成致命的威胁。
    那末，出路何在呢？走向保障欧洲安全的道路在哪里呢？保卫欧洲所有国家，其中包括英国的安全的方法在哪里呢？
    在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上苏联代表团提出的关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议中已经回答了这些问题。第一，苏联的建议保证建立一个考虑到欧洲所有国家的利益的可靠的欧洲集体安全体系。第二，这些建议为解决许多其他悬而未决的国际问题，首先是德国问题扫清道路。因此，英国广大社会人士对于苏联建议表示关怀是可以理解的。
    英国人民对巩固欧洲和平的殷切希望表现在日内瓦会议的结果在英国获得普遍的拥护。保守党国会议员布士比认为日内瓦会议是“全世界道义力量的巨大胜利，这种道义力量将以越来越大的压力加诸所有的政府以利于和平事业”。
    正是由于英国人民“道义力量”的影响，英国代表团在日内瓦——法国代表团也是一样——认为有必要提出一些旨在加强欧洲和平的建议。英国首相艾登在日内瓦会议上宣称，英国代表团将赞成导致增加欧洲国与国之间的信任的保障安全问题的一切建议。艾登本人提出了一项缔结有英国、苏联、美国、法国和统一的德国参加的公约的建议，同时声称他准备考虑关于增加公约参加国家的数目的问题。他还提出在沿东方和西方分界线的两边的一定区域中驻扎由双方任命的视察组的建议。
    日内瓦四国政府首脑会议对于欧洲安全事业是有贡献的。解决欧洲安全问题的具体和有效的方法有待于十月二十七日开幕的苏、美、英、法四国外长会议去谋求。谋求这样的方法是符合英国和其他国家人民的根本利益的。在英国，人们越来越清楚地理解到这点。英国广泛阶层的人民赞成建立欧洲安全体系。英国一些大的报刊的有利于加强欧洲和平的许多言论是这种情绪的反映。例如，“泰晤士报”在为苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议讨论日内瓦会议结果而发表的社论中说道：
    “初看起来好像是，布尔加宁元帅和艾登关于欧洲安全公约的意见彼此越来越接近了……如果是这样，十月外长会议的结果将能取得协议，是可以期待的。和解确实是可能的。大家都应当期待这个并且促成这个。这样一个公约会是欧洲更加稳定和信任的基础。”
    其他许多英国报刊也以同样的精神发表意见。例如，“雷诺新闻”就呼吁把英国的政策转向取消现存的军事集团而代之以普遍安全体系。
    自然，英国还有一些有影响的势力，用一切方法力图妨碍达成欧洲安全的协议。在那些认为继续“冷战”和国家军国主义化政策对自己有利的集团的影响下，英国报刊中出现一些企图妨碍缓和国际紧张局势的论文。某些英国报刊竭力散播对国际关系今后发展的悲观的预测。
    英国报刊对于德国问题——与保障英国的安全紧密联系的问题——给以极大的注意。大家知道，某些英国报刊企图证明，好像整个德国加入西方国家军事集团是符合加强欧洲和平的利益的。同时，对于解决像关于建立欧洲集体安全体系这样重要的问题，他们或者是有意地回避，或者是留待将来，为的是要在统一的德国已经加入西方国家军事集团以后再“试图”去达成协议。“旁观者”杂志遵循的就是这种政策，这个杂志在社论中表述西方国家的立场如下：“首先恢复德国的统一”。
    但是，这是本末倒置的。目前，英国某些集团表示想要这样来统一德国，就是统一的德国要成为西方国家军事集团参加者，这当然是同加强欧洲和平的利益没有任何共同之处的。“雷诺新闻”强调指出这种情形时认为：“统一德国的问题不应当成为这样一个障碍物：一切其他的和平希望碰到它就会破灭”，建立欧洲安全体系的希望当然也包括在内。
    苏联和英国之间的合作是保障欧洲和平的重要因素。这种合作，会成为使世界上这一最重要地区不产生新战争威胁、使英国和其他国家的安全不受威胁的可靠的保证。
    第二次世界大战特别令人信服地证明了英苏合作对于欧洲和平事业的意义。“泰晤士报”在一九四五年评价英国和苏联之间的合作对于和平事业和两国根本利益的意义时曾经写道：英国对外政策的重要基础“是同俄国的联盟，它是在战争中取得胜利的必要条件……正如胜利是联合努力的产物一样，这种联合努力的继续保持，乃是坚固的欧洲协调的可靠的和实际可能的基础。当英国和俄国双方都各自保卫着和平，当它们之间建立了牢不可破的信任和合作的时候，欧洲的和平就会得到保障。如果英国和俄国互相离弃，那么不仅对于整个欧洲，而且对这两个大国说来，前途都会是黑暗的……无论是英国或俄国，如果它们不愿给自己的民族利益以及欧洲的普遍利益带来严重损害，它们就应当乐于这样做：不能让自己采取即使是短时期的分裂和分歧的政策。”的确，英苏关系过去已有的经验清楚地证明，在英国同苏联共同行动的那些时期，英国的安全就得到了最好的保证；反之，在两国之间的良好关系遭到破坏的那些时期，英国的利益总是蒙受损失。遗憾的是，战后时期英国和苏联的关系的发展，并不是像两国的利益和欧洲和平的利益所要求的那样。英国的参加旨在反对苏联的军事集团，已经给欧洲安全的事业带来了不小的损害。英国和苏联在维护和平中相互之间的利害关系，较之目前存在于两国之间的争执的问题具有更为巨大的重要意义。英国也承认这一点。
    苏联代表团在日内瓦四大国政府首脑会议上为促进同英国的关系采取了一定的步骤，这是苏联和英国人民一致拥护的。苏联代表团和英国首相艾登曾就巩固苏联和英国之间的关系的方式和方法问题进行讨论。尼·亚·布尔加宁和尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫接受了艾登先生的邀请将访问英国，这在苏联最高苏维埃会议上得到了一致的赞同。苏联政府认为，发展高级人员个人之间的接触，对于改善英苏关系具有重大意义。苏联代表团在日内瓦同艾登非正式商谈的过程中，善意地讨论了关于组织海军舰队和军事代表团相互访问的问题。日内瓦会议以后，苏联和英国之间开始了关于发展文化合作方面的联系问题的谈判。到苏联来的英国代表团的数目增加了，到英国去的苏联代表团的数目也增加了；许多英国工会和体育代表团以及英国各城市的代表访问了莫斯科。苏联各族人民对英国人民抱着友谊的感情。曾于今年七月访问莫斯科的伦敦市长霍华德声称：“最使我感动的是，所有的俄国人都希望和平，希望同其他国家人民合作。”苏联人知道，大多数英国人民对我国也是友好的。×××可靠地保障欧洲安全对英国人民有着切身的利害关系。广大的英国公众在整个战后时期一直为争取欧洲的和平而积极斗争。在这一方面，他们得到了苏联和各国人民的支持，因为保障欧洲和平是防止世界任何一地的战争的决定性条件之一。（叁仁译自苏联“新时代”杂志一九五五年第三十九期）
