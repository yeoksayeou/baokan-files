Xinhua News Agency, October 27th. The General Bureau of Capital Construction of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry decided at a recent capital construction meeting to complete a portion of the workload originally planned for next year in thirty-two projects under its jurisdiction during the fourth quarter of this year, to create favorable conditions for achieving the heavy construction plan for next year. According to preliminary calculations, this portion of the workload executed ahead of schedule accounts for approximately 10% of the total workload for these thirty-two projects this year.

Many of these thirty-two projects are key projects of our country's First Five-Year Plan, including seven new power plants in Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, and others, more than ten expanded power plants in Fuxin, Datong, and others, and a portion of power transmission and substation projects. The Jiamusi Paper Mill Thermal Power Plant originally planned to complete a portion of its equipment in the first quarter of next year, but now it has been decided to complete it by the end of this year, and preparations are being made to install a boiler originally scheduled for next year ahead of schedule this year. The second-phase construction project of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant was also originally scheduled to officially commence next year, but now it has been decided to advance the entire construction period, and the foundation for the plant buildings will be excavated in December of this year.

In order to further ensure that these thirty-two projects can smoothly achieve the construction plan ahead of schedule next year, representatives from relevant construction units, construction, and design departments participating in this capital construction meeting conducted a item-by-item study of the equipment, design, materials, and other issues required for these projects, and proposed specific solutions.

    三十二项电业建设工程提前执行施工计划
    新华社二十七日讯　电力工业部基本建设总局在最近召开的基本建设会议上，决定把所属三十二项工程准备在明年施工的一部分工作量，提前在今年第四季度来完成，为实现明年繁重的建设计划创造有利条件。据初步计算，这部分提前施工的工作量，约占这三十二项工程今年全部工作量的百分之十。
    这三十二项工程中有很多是我国第一个五年计划的重点工程，其中包括石家庄、太原等七个新建电站，阜新、大同等十多个扩建电站和一部分送电变电工程。佳木斯造纸厂热电站原来计划在明年第一季度完工的一部分设备，现在决定提前在今年年底完工，并且准备把原定明年安装的一台锅炉，也提前在今年安装完毕。太原热电站的第二期建厂工程根据原订计划也是在明年才能正式动工，现在决定把整个工期提前，在今年十二月间就开挖厂房的基础。
    为了进一步保证这三十二项工程明年能够顺利地提前实现施工计划，参加这次基本建设会议的有关建设单位和施工、设计部门的代表，对这些工程所需的设备、设计和材料等问题，逐项地进行了研究，并提出了具体的解决办法。
