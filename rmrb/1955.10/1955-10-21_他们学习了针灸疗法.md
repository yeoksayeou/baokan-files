    They Learned Acupuncture Therapy
    Bai Sheng
    In order to disseminate the rich medical heritage of the motherland to higher medical colleges, the Ministry of Health held an acupuncture teacher training class for higher medical colleges in Beijing this July. The trainees participating in this training class included professors, lecturers, assistant teachers, and physicians preparing to take on teaching work from 23 higher medical colleges across the country, including veteran professors with 20 years of teaching experience. Some medical units in industrial departments, upon hearing that the Ministry of Health was going to hold an acupuncture teacher training class, also actively requested to send people to attend and study as auditors. Now, after more than three months of intense and pleasant study, all 37 students in the class have mastered the preliminary theory of acupuncture and the basic operational methods of acupuncture therapy.
    It was still the hot summer, and schools across the country had already started their summer vacations, but the students of the acupuncture teacher training class for higher medical colleges began their intense first lesson. Most of them had just finished their teaching work in higher education institutions and hurried to participate in the acupuncture class. Associate Professor Gao Pitai of Hebei Medical College, immediately after finishing the final exams for his students, took a train to Beijing to participate in the study on the second day. The students, with enthusiasm for learning the medical heritage of the motherland, entered the classroom. Professor Wei Rushu of Dalian Medical College had already studied and researched at the Acupuncture Therapy Experimental Institute of the Ministry of Health for a period of time. When he heard that the Ministry of Health was going to hold such a systematic acupuncture training class with lectures and clinical practice, he insisted on requesting approval from the administrative leaders of the college to come and study. Now he is sitting in the classroom with many young people, carefully listening to the teachers lecturing and diligently taking notes. The content of the acupuncture class is very rich. In order to enable students to establish a correct understanding of traditional Chinese medicine during the learning process, understand the existing acupuncture theories, master practical operational techniques, and combine clinical treatment work to carry out acupuncture teaching work in higher medical colleges, under the principle of combining theory and practice, the courses of study include traditional Chinese medicine policies, acupuncture theory and operational methods, the history of Chinese medicine, and Pavlov's theory, using "New Acupuncture" as the basic textbook, and devoting a large amount of time to clinical practice. This class is specifically managed by the Acupuncture Experimental Institute of the Ministry of Health, and some experienced veteran Chinese medicine practitioners in Beijing are invited to give special reports to introduce clinical experience. Some responsible comrades from the Ministry of Health also gave reports to the students on traditional Chinese medicine policies.
    The head of the acupuncture class is concurrently held by Zhu Lian, the vice president of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The duration of the acupuncture class is six months. In order to ensure the successful completion of the teaching tasks within a short six months, the physicians and acupuncture technicians of each treatment room of the Acupuncture Experimental Institute have temporarily put aside some of their research work and actively helped the acupuncture training class to carefully prepare lessons, teach, and guide practice. They also formed a teaching and research group and formulated a detailed teaching plan, dividing the study into three stages: preliminary lessons, clinical practice, and summary. The Acupuncture Experimental Institute also designated eight of the twelve treatment rooms in the institute as places for students to practice clinically.
    Since the start of school, the students' learning enthusiasm has been very high. According to the teaching requirements, students must be familiar with 130 commonly used acupuncture points for acupuncture treatment in various parts of the human body before practice. However, the locations and names of these points are not easy to remember. In the past, it generally took a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner one or two years to learn them, but now they have to memorize them in just a few months. Teachers require students to first memorize the names and correct locations of the 130 commonly used acupuncture points for acupuncture treatment. With the help of teachers, students are carefully reciting the names of these acupuncture points while reviewing anatomy in order to correctly understand the location and local anatomical conditions of each acupuncture point. Fifty-year-old professors and young people are together, loudly reciting and quizzing each other on these difficult-to-remember acupuncture point names and locations. To facilitate memorization, many students have composed the point names into song lyrics to recite, and even during meals or breaks, they use their fingers or chopsticks to point out the acupuncture points to review. Professor Wei Rushu of Dalian Medical College excitedly told me that he achieved very good results in an acupuncture point examination held in the class. To prepare for the exam, he worked hard to memorize 130 acupuncture points. In the exam, he answered only a little bit wrong when answering the teacher's questions about 20 acupuncture points drawn by lot. In order to further delve into acupuncture theory, in addition to attending classes and clinical practice, he also uses the time for self-study every night to study the ancient Chinese acupuncture literature "Huangdi Neijing." He attaches great importance to the basic operations of acupuncture. He believes that only by laying a solid foundation and mastering the basic operations can one talk about research work, and only in this way can one better help the younger generation learn the precious acupuncture heritage of the motherland. In a short period of study, he has become very interested in researching traditional Chinese medicine. Professor Gao Pitai was initially afraid of falling behind the young people, especially because he was older and had a poor memory, and could not remember so many difficult-to-remember acupuncture point names for a while. However, due to diligent study, he also achieved good results in his studies. When I talked to him about his feelings about learning traditional Chinese medicine, he frankly said that he now realized the greatness and richness of China's medical heritage and changed some of his past incorrect views on traditional Chinese medicine. In the past, due to the influence of bourgeois medical education, he did not understand traditional Chinese medicine at all and looked down on traditional Chinese medicine. But after studying, he began to explore the medicine of the motherland with young people with an enthusiasm for knowledge. After the acupuncture clinical practice started, when he first inserted the needle into the patient's body, he felt very nervous, always afraid that the acupuncture point was not accurate. Under the guidance of acupuncture teachers, he gradually mastered the operation method and learned the techniques of acupuncture. When he saw that a female patient with a gastric ulcer had significantly improved after his dozens of acupuncture treatments, he was infinitely excited. The undeniable efficacy of acupuncture therapy convinced him to praise the brilliant achievements of traditional Chinese medicine. In his mind, he began to consider how to learn the theory and operational techniques of acupuncture well so that he could spread it to higher medical schools in the future and teach it to the future generation of young doctors.
    The young student Li Mingxiang came from Harbin Medical University. When he first came to the acupuncture class, his understanding of learning acupuncture was not enough, because he used to think that traditional Chinese medicine was unscientific and had nothing to learn. But after he came into contact with acupuncture, a part of the medical heritage of the motherland, his mind suddenly opened up. In clinical practice, he personally experienced how rich ancient Chinese medicine was! When he saw a patient with neurasthenia return to normal after he treated him with acupuncture therapy, how happy he was! He was determined to study the medicine of the motherland hard, learn acupuncture therapy well, and bring it back to higher medical schools.
    After more than three months of intense and pleasant study, the students of the acupuncture training class have greatly increased their confidence and interest in learning and researching acupuncture. They all said that they would concentrate on learning the theory and operational techniques of acupuncture and further use scientific viewpoints and methods to study and summarize the rich experience in acupuncture treatment in our country, improve this great and rich medical heritage, so as to better serve the health of the people.

    他们学习了针灸疗法
    柏生
    为把祖国丰富的医学遗产传播到高等医学院校去，今年七月，卫生部在北京举办了一个高等医学院校针灸师资训练班。参加这个训练班学习的学员有来自全国二十三所高等医学院校的教授、讲师、助教和准备担任教学工作的医师，其中包括具有二十年教学经验的老教授。有些产业部门的医务单位听说卫生部要办针灸师资训练班，也积极要求派人参加旁听学习。现在，全班三十七名学员经过三个多月紧张的愉快的学习，已经掌握了针灸的初步理论和针灸疗法的基本操作方法。
    那还是炎热的夏天，全国各个学校都已放了暑假，高等医学院校针灸师资训练班的学员们却开始了紧张的第一课。他们大都是刚结束了高等学校的教学工作后，就急忙赶来参加针灸班学习的。河北医学院高丕泰副教授，就是在刚刚结束了学生们的期终考试工作的第二天，就搭上火车赶来北京参加学习的。学员们抱着学习祖国医学遗产的热情，走上了课堂。大连医学院的魏如恕老教授，本来已经在卫生部针灸疗法实验所学习研究过一个时期，当他听到卫生部要办这样一个系统讲授和临床实习的针灸训练班的时候，他就坚持请求院行政领导方面批准他来学习。现在他正和许多年青人一起坐在课堂上，细心地倾听着教员给他们讲课，认真地记着笔记。针灸班学习的内容是非常丰富的。为了使学员们在学习过程中树立对祖国医学的正确认识，了解现有的针灸理论，掌握实际操作技术，以结合临床治疗工作开展高等医学院校的针灸教学工作，在理论和实际相结合的原则下，学习的课程有中医政策、针灸理论和操作方法、中国医学史以及巴甫洛夫学说等，以“新针灸学”为基本教材，并以大量的时间从事临床实习。这个班由卫生部针灸实验所具体负责，并聘请了北京一些有经验的老中医作专题报告，介绍临床经验，卫生部的一些负责同志也给学员们作了关于中医政策的报告。
    针灸班的班主任由中医研究院副院长朱琏兼任。针灸班学习的时间是六个月。为了保证在短短的六个月内很好地完成教学任务，针灸实验所各治疗室的医师和针灸技术员们，都暂时放下了自己的一部分研究工作，积极帮助针灸训练班认真备课、教学和辅导实习。他们还组成了一个教研组，制定了周详的教学计划，把学习分作前期课、临床实习和总结三个阶段。针灸实验所并指定全所十二个治疗室中的八个作为学员们临床实习的地方。
    从开学到现在，学员们的学习情绪一直非常高。按照教学的要求，学员们在实习前必须熟悉人体各部分的针灸治疗常用的一百三十个穴位。但这些穴的部位和名称是不容易记下来的，过去一般中医都要花一两年的时间才能学会，可是现在他们却要在短短的几个月中记熟。教师们要求学员们首先熟记针灸治疗常用的一百三十个穴位的名称和正确部位。学员们在教师的帮助下，一面认真地背诵着这些穴位的名称，一面复习解剖学，以便正确地了解各个穴位的位置和局部解剖情形。五十岁的老教授和青年们在一起，大声地背诵着和互相考问着这些难记的穴位名称和部位。许多学员为了便于记忆，他们把穴名编成歌词来背诵，甚至在吃饭或休息的时候，也互相用手指或筷子指点着穴位来复习。大连医学院的魏如恕老教授兴奋地告诉我，他在班里举行的一次针灸孔穴考试中成绩很好。为了准备考试，他曾努力地背诵了一百三十个穴位。他在考试抽签中回答教师问的二十个穴位，只答错了一点点。为了进一步钻研针灸理论，现在他除了上课和临床实习以外，每天还利用晚上自习的时间学习中国古代针灸学文献“黄帝内经”。他对针灸的基本操作是十分重视的，他认为只有打好了基础，掌握了基本操作，才能谈到研究工作，也只有这样，才能更好地帮助青年一代学习祖国宝贵的针灸学遗产。在短短的一段学习过程中，已经使他对研究祖国医学发生了很大的兴趣。高丕泰老教授最初学习时，唯恐落在青年人的后头，尤其怕因为上了年纪，记忆力不好，一时记不下那么多难记的穴位名称。但由于勤苦钻研，他学习的成绩也很好。当我和他谈起学习中医的感想时，他坦白地说，直到现在，他才认识到中国医学遗产的伟大和丰富，改变了过去对中医的一些不正确的看法。过去由于资产阶级医学教育的影响，使他根本不认识中医，看不起中医。但是学习以后，他开始怀着求知的热情，同青年人在一起努力探讨着祖国医学。针灸临床实习开始以后，当他第一次把针扎到病人身上的时候，他感到非常紧张，总怕针灸的穴位不准确。在针灸教师的辅导下，他逐渐掌握了操作方法，学会了针灸的手法。当他看到一个患胃溃疡的女病人在他十几次的针灸后，病情有了显著的好转的时候，他无限兴奋。针灸疗法的不可抹煞的疗效，使他信服地赞扬着中医的辉煌成就。在他的脑子里开始考虑着如何学好针灸学的理论和操作技术，以便将来把它传播到高等医学校里去，传授给未来的青年一代的医生们。
    年青的学员李明祥是从哈尔滨医科大学来的。在刚来针灸班的时候，他对学习针灸的认识还是不够的，因为他过去曾认为中医是不科学的，没有什么可学的。但是他在接触了祖国医学遗产针灸这一个部分以后，他的头脑豁然开朗起来。在临床实习中，他亲身体会到中国古代医学是多么丰富！当他看到一个患神经衰弱的病人，经过他用针灸疗法治疗后恢复正常状态的时候，他是多么高兴！他下定决心要努力钻研祖国的医学，学好针灸疗法，把它带回高等医学校里去。
    三个多月的紧张愉快的学习，针灸训练班的学员们，对学习和研究针灸学的信心和兴趣都大大地增加了。他们都表示要专心地学好针灸的理论和操作技术，并进一步用科学的观点和方法来研究和总结我国针灸治疗方面的丰富经验，把这伟大丰富的医学遗产提高一步，以更好地为人民的健康服务。
