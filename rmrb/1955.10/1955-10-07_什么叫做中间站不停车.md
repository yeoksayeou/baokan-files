What is a Non-Stopping Intermediate Station?

　　After a freight train on the railway travels a prescribed distance, it often needs to stop to change to a new locomotive (engine) to pull the train. The original locomotive may pull another train back. Even if the locomotive is not changed, the freight cars that have arrived at the station must be detached and the freight cars to be sent off must be added. At the same time, the train crew must hand over their duties, and the vehicles must be checked for any defects. On the railway, this prescribed distance that the train travels is called a section, and the stopping station (i.e., the stations at both ends of the section) is called a section station. There are also some small stations between the two section stations, which are called intermediate stations.

　　Usually, when those freight cars that do not load or unload goods or detach or add vehicles at the intermediate stations travel between two section stations, they still have to stop several times at some small stations along the way. The reason is to replenish water for the locomotive, to clean up the fire bed of the locomotive boiler, to inspect the locomotive and add oil; also, on a single track, it is necessary to pass trains coming from the opposite direction, or to let faster trains coming from behind pass first (even on double tracks, it is necessary to yield). Therefore, general freight trains usually have to stop two or three times at intermediate stations, and some stop even more times.

　　Stopping at an intermediate station once generally takes ten minutes or so, which hinders the speeding up of locomotive and vehicle turnover. Implementing the non-stopping intermediate station operation method can speed up the turnover of locomotives and vehicles. In fact, as long as the dispatcher's plan is very thorough, each train can be prevented from interfering with each other, and freight trains can be prevented from stopping at intermediate stations; as long as the locomotive crew prepares adequately and improves operating skills, they can also save water and maintain the good condition of the furnace bed, and do not need to stop at intermediate stations.

　　Non-stopping intermediate station operation means that when a freight train travels on the railway, it goes directly from one section station to another section station without stopping at the intermediate stations. Railway workers call this operation "green street" because the trains that do not stop at the intermediate stations only see green signal lights (indicating permission to pass) when passing through each station, just like a green street.

　　Non-stopping intermediate station operation is an advanced Soviet experience, and an effective method for making trains run faster and organizing axle-loads more universally. The Soviet Union calls it the method of "towing fast and direct axle-load locomotives," which is a more correct name.

    什么叫做中间站不停车
    铁路上运货的列车行驶了一个规定的距离以后，往往要停下来换一个机车（车头）来拉这一列车，原来的机车可能要拉另一列车回去。即使不换机车，也要在这时把已到站的货车摘解下来，把要送走的货车加挂上去；同时，列车上的乘务人员要交接班；要检查车辆是否良好。在铁路上，列车行驶的这一段规定的距离，叫做一个区段，这个停车的车站（即区段两头的车站）叫做区段站。而在两个区段站之间还有一些小车站，都叫中间站。
    平常，那些在中间站不装卸货物和甩挂车辆的货车在两个区段站之间行驶时，也总要在中间站的几个小站上停几次车。原因是要给机车上水，要整理机车锅炉的火床，要检查机车并给油；还有，在单线上要和对面来的列车错车，或者要让后面开来的快车先走（复线也要让路）。所以，一般的货车总要在中间站停两三次车，有的停车次数还要多。
    在中间站停车一次，一般总要十来分钟，对加快机车、车辆周转有妨碍。实行中间站不停车的运行方法，就可以加快机车、车辆的周转。实际上，只要调度员的计划很周密，就能使各次列车互不妨碍，可以不让货车在中间站停车；只要机车乘务员准备得充分，提高了操纵技术，也能够节省用水，保持炉床的良好状态，也不要在中间站停车。
    中间站不停车运行就是运货的列车在铁路上行驶时，直接由一个区段站到另一个区段站，在中间站上不停车。在铁路工人中称这种运行为“绿街”，因为中间站不停车的列车通过各个车站时都只见绿信号灯（表示允许列车通过），就像一条绿的街一样。
    中间站不停车运行是苏联先进经验，是使列车更快地运行和更普遍地组织超轴的有效方法。苏联叫做“牵引快速和直通的超轴机车”的方法，这是更正确的名字。
