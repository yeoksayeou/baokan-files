    Shaanxi, Gansu, and other provinces have launched large-scale coalfield general and detailed surveys
    Geological workers in Shaanxi, Gansu, and other provinces have now begun large-scale coalfield general and detailed surveys to provide coal for industry and transportation in the Northwest region during the Second Five-Year Plan.
    This year, the area covered by coalfield general and detailed surveys in the Northwest region has more than doubled compared to last year. Several hundred geological personnel, surveyors, and geological engineers are participating in this work.
      Currently, the general survey of the Pucheng area of the Weibei Coalfield in Shaanxi Province has been completed, and black coal seams have been found in several control boreholes. The general surveys of Jintai Ridge and Jinhua Mountain in the Tongchuan mining area and Dongshuiquan in Shandan, Gansu Province, have proven that the coal reserves are large and of good quality, making them important exploration bases for the future. In addition, large-scale topographic surveying and geological investigation work has recently been launched in a newly discovered coalfield in Yongchang, Gansu.
    Since liberation, a large amount of coal deposits has been proven in the Northwest region, but these resources can only meet the coal needs of Northwest's industrial development in recent years. Therefore, vigorously carrying out coalfield general and detailed surveys and opening up new coal bases is a very important task. (Xinhua News Agency)

    陕西甘肃等省展开大规模煤田普查详查
    陕西、甘肃等省的地质工作人员，现在已开始为西北地区第二个五年计划期间工业和交通运输业用煤，展开大规模的煤田普查和详查工作。
    今年西北地区煤田普查和详查的面积比去年扩大了一倍多。参加这项工作的有几百名地质人员、测量人员和地质工程师。
      目前，陕西省渭北大煤田蒲城一带的矿区普查已告结束，所打的几个控制钻孔都见到了黑色煤层。铜川矿区的军台岭、金华山和甘肃省山丹东水泉等地区，经过普查证明，煤炭储量多，质量较好，是将来重要的勘探基点。另外，在甘肃永昌新发现的一块煤田，最近也展开了大面积的地形测量和地质调查工作。
    解放以后，西北地区虽已探明了大量的煤藏，但这些资源只能满足近几年内西北工业发展用煤的需要。因此，大力开展煤田普查和详查工作，开辟新的煤炭基地是一项很重要的任务。（新华社）
