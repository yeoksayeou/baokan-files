Xinhua News Agency, Budapest News: The 28th meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions was held in Budapest from the 9th to the 12th. Attending the meeting were World Federation of Trade Unions President Vittorio, World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant, and seven vice-presidents of the Federation.

	In his opening speech, Vittorio pointed out the relaxation of the international situation in the recent period. He said that thanks to the unwavering peaceful policy pursued by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and thanks to the struggle of the working class and all progressive forces demanding peace, the Geneva Conference has created the possibility of replacing the "position of strength" policy with a policy that makes it possible to resolve international issues through negotiation. He concluded by emphasizing that guaranteeing and improving the living standards of the working people is the basic task of the trade union movement.

	Liu Changsheng, Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, made a report at the meeting on the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions in the United Nations, the International Labor Organization, and other international institutions. He pointed out that the purpose of the World Federation of Trade Unions' activities in this regard is to resolve issues such as peace and disarmament, the fight against unemployment, the defense of trade union rights and the independence of colonial peoples, the struggle for higher living standards and better social security for the working people, the defense of the rights of working women, and the fight against racial discrimination and forced labor.

	Grassie made a report at the meeting on the organizational preparations for the World Conference of Working Women, which is being convened to protect the trade union rights of working women and improve their living conditions. Grassie said that the Preparatory Committee for the World Conference of Working Women has decided to convene the conference on June 14, 1956. After discussion, the Presidium of the World Federation of Trade Unions approved the report.

	World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant made a report on the international situation and the expansion of unity among trade unions in various countries in the struggle for peace, a better life, and freedom. Speaking of the significance of the Geneva Four-Power Summit, Saillant said that due to changes in the international situation, it is now possible to strengthen international trade union unity and consolidate and develop ties between trade unions in various countries.

	The meeting passed a number of resolutions. The resolution on the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions in the United Nations, the International Labor Organization, and other specialized agencies stated that the changes in the international situation resulting from the recent struggle of the peoples of all countries for peace have made it necessary for the World Federation of Trade Unions to further strengthen its activities in the United Nations in order to actively defend the interests of the working people there, using every possible opportunity to further promote the relaxation of tensions and strengthen international trade union unity. The resolution pointed out that the World Federation of Trade Unions must concentrate its efforts on addressing concrete issues of vital importance to the working masses, paying particular attention to the situation and struggles of the working people in colonial and dependent countries.

	In the resolution on the international situation and the development of unity among the working people and their trade unions in the struggle for peace, bread, and freedom, the Executive Bureau emphasized that the Geneva Conference marked the victory of the spirit of mutual understanding and consultation and the failure of the "position of strength" policy. This is the result of the resolute struggle of the peoples of all countries, and above all the working people. The Executive Bureau believes that satisfying the aspirations of oppressed peoples for national independence is necessary for consolidating peace. The resolution calls for the conclusion of an international agreement on the simultaneous and supervised substantial reduction of armaments. The Executive Bureau believes that the World Federation of Trade Unions and all trade union organizations have a responsibility to take the initiative to bring about disarmament and further ease international tensions. The resolution points out that employers and governments in the capitalist world are continuing and intensifying their offensive. If the working people are to make their struggle a success, they must unite and organize. The resolution states that the desire for unity and cooperation among all trade unions is the most important characteristic of the international labor movement today. Therefore, the Executive Bureau reiterates that the World Federation of Trade Unions and its affiliated organizations are prepared to support all initiatives to build unity and agreement, and are prepared to cooperate with all trade union organizations that are determined to fight for the vital interests of the working people.

	The Executive Bureau also passed a resolution on establishing friendly and fraternal relations with the Central Council of the Yugoslav Trade Union Confederation.

	The meeting also decided to convene a meeting of leaders of the Trade Union Internationals (Industrial Departments of the World Federation of Trade Unions) in Prague from December 5 to 7 this year.

	The Executive Bureau telegraphed the Director-General of the International Labor Organization, requesting him to receive a delegation from the Presidium to discuss the possibility of promoting relations between the World Federation of Trade Unions and the International Labor Organization. The Executive Bureau also telegraphed the President of the United Nations General Assembly, presenting the World Federation of Trade Unions' views on the issues of peace, disarmament, and national self-determination.

    世界工联执行局在布达佩斯举行会议
    新华社十六日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：世界工会联合会执行局九日到十二日在布达佩斯举行第二十八次会议。参加会议的有世界工会联合会主席维多里奥、世界工会联合会总书记赛扬，以及联合会的七名副主席。
    维多里奥在致开幕词时指出最近一个时期国际局势的缓和。他说，由于苏联和各人民民主国家所奉行的坚持不渝的和平政策，由于工人阶级和所有要求和平的进步力量的斗争，在日内瓦会议后出现了以一种使得有可能通过谈判来解决国际问题的政策来代替“实力地位”政策的可能性。他最后强调指出，保障和改善劳动人民的生活水平是工会运动的基本任务。
    世界工会联合会书记刘长胜在会上作了一个关于世界工联在联合国、国际劳工组织和其他国际机构中的活动的报告。他指出，世界工联在这方面的活动的目的是要解决这样一些问题：和平和裁减军备问题、反失业斗争的问题、保卫工会权利和殖民地人民的独立问题、争取劳动人民的较高的生活水平、较好的社会保险、保卫劳动妇女的权利、反对种族歧视和强迫劳动的问题。
    葛拉西在会上作了关于世界劳动妇女会议的组织筹备情况的报告，这个会议的召开是为了保护劳动妇女的工会权利和改善她们的生活条件。葛拉西说，世界劳动妇女会议筹备委员会已经决定在一九五六年六月十四日召开这个会议。在讨论后，世界工联主席团批准了这个报告。
    世界工联总书记赛扬作了关于国际形势以及各国工会在争取和平、美好生活和自由的斗争中扩大团结的问题的报告。赛扬讲到日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的意义时说，由于国际局势的变化，现在已经有可能加强国际工会的团结、巩固和发展各国工会之间的联系。
    会议通过了许多决议。关于世界工会联合会在联合国、国际劳工组织和其他专门机构中的活动的决议说：最近由于各国人民争取和平的斗争而产生的国际局势的变化已经使世界工联有必要在联合国中进一步加强活动，以便在那里利用一切可能的机会来积极地保卫劳动人民的利益，以求进一步促进紧张局势的缓和和加强国际工会的团结。决议指出，世界工联必须集中力量处理对劳动群众具有切身重要性的具体问题，特别是注意殖民地和附属国家内的劳动人民的境况和斗争。
    在关于国际形势和发展劳动人民与他们的工会在争取和平、面包和自由的斗争中的团结的决议中，执行局强调指出：日内瓦会议标志着相互谅解和协商的精神的胜利和“实力地位”政策的失败。这是各国人民，首先是劳动人民坚决斗争的结果。执行局认为，满足被压迫人民的民族独立的愿望，是巩固和平所必需的。决议要求缔结一项关于同时地和有监督地大大裁减军备的国际协定。执行局认为世界工联和一切工会组织有责任采取主动，以便促成裁军的实现和国际紧张局势的进一步缓和。决议指出：资本主义世界的雇主和政府还在继续和加强他们的进攻。劳动人民如果要使他们的斗争得到胜利，就必须团结起来和组织起来。决议说：希望一切工会团结和合作的愿望今天是国际劳工运动的最重要的特点。因此，执行局重申：世界工会联合会及其所属组织准备支持建立团结和协议的一切倡议，并且准备同一切决定为劳动人民的切身利益而斗争的工会组织合作。
    执行局还通过了一项关于同南斯拉夫工会联合会中央理事会建立友好的兄弟关系的决议。
    会议还决定在今年十二月五日至七日在布拉格召开各工会国际（世界工联各产业部）领导人的会议。
    执行局打电报给国际劳工组织的总负责人，要求他接待主席团的一个代表团，以讨论促进世界工会联合会和国际劳工组织之间的关系的可能性。执行局还打电报给联合国大会的主席，提出了世界工会联合会对和平、裁军和民族自决权这些问题的意见。
