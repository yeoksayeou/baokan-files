Xinhua News Agency, October 11th. The International Commission for Cambodia recently submitted its third interim report on the military assistance agreement signed between the United States and the Kingdom of Cambodia on May 16, 1955, to the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference.

The report mentioned that the Commission believes that some clauses of the US-Cambodian military assistance agreement are inconsistent with the Geneva Accords and requested the Kingdom Government to clarify them. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as a participant in the Geneva Conference and as a signatory to the Cambodian Armistice Agreement, sent a letter to the International Commission protesting that the US-Cambodian military assistance agreement violated the Geneva Accords. The Kingdom Government of Cambodia explained the meaning of some clauses of the US-Cambodian military assistance agreement and assured that it would strictly abide by the Geneva Accords and implement a neutral policy. The Kingdom Government guaranteed that it was not bound by any US legislation, especially the Mutual Security Act; guaranteed that it would not participate in any military blocs, enter into military alliances with foreign countries, or provide foreign countries with military bases; and guaranteed that it would give the International Commission full cooperation to supervise the import of war materials. Based on this, the Commission made a resolution on July 23. The resolution welcomed the clarification and guarantees made by the Kingdom Government regarding the US-Cambodian military assistance agreement. The resolution also pointed out that although some clauses of the US-Cambodian military assistance agreement exceeded the limitations of the Geneva Accords, the Commission was willing to accept the guarantees of the Kingdom Government. The resolution finally requested the Kingdom Government to earnestly fulfill those guarantees in the future and to provide full cooperation when the Commission conducts supervision in accordance with the relevant clauses of the Geneva Accords.

The report also includes the International Commission's letter to the Kingdom Government on July 5, 1955, regarding the US-Cambodian military assistance agreement, and the Kingdom Government's reply letter on July 13. The full texts of these two letters are as follows:

Cambodian International Commission, Indian Chairman
Letter to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom Government of Cambodia

Your Excellency:

I would like to refer to your letter No. 2293 CM dated June 17, 1955, in which you requested the International Commission to inform the Kingdom Government of our views on the military assistance agreement signed between the United States and Cambodia on May 16, 1955.

The International Commission has also received a letter of protest from General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, in which he put forward the views of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the US-Cambodian agreement.

In order to understand all aspects of the issue, the International Commission has carefully reviewed not only the exchange of letters between the Cambodian representatives and the American representatives but also the statement made by the Kingdom Government regarding the military assistance agreement and the memorandum attached to your letter to us dated June 29, 1955. The International Commission has also considered the statement made by Your Excellency to the International Commission on May 30, 1955.

The International Commission has noted the communique issued by the Kingdom Government on May 29, 1955, especially the following quoted paragraph:

"The Kingdom Government is prepared to strictly and consistently respect the provisions of the Geneva Accords related to it and the understanding put forward by the delegation led by His Majesty Sihanouk at the Asian-African Conference in the name of the Kingdom Government. The government reiterates its endorsement of his statement regarding Cambodia's neutrality."

The aforementioned communique of May 29 also stated:

"Therefore, the purpose of the recently signed agreement with the United States is for the United States to directly provide military assistance to Cambodia. There is no question of granting military bases, or any kind of military alliance, or sending American military instructors to Cambodia."

In the statement made by the Kingdom Government in Geneva on July 20, 1954 (this statement has been included in Article 7 of the Geneva Accords and Paragraph 4 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference), Cambodia does not request foreign assistance regarding military materials, personnel, and instructors, unless it is for effectively defending its territory.

There is no doubt that Cambodia has the sovereignty to seek foreign assistance from any source, as long as the sole purpose of such assistance is to organize its effective defense.

However, it has been doubted whether some specific provisions of the new military assistance agreement are consistent with the Geneva Accords, because some obligations undertaken by Cambodia under this new agreement have exceeded the requirements of an agreement as envisioned by the Geneva Accords, the sole purpose of which is to obtain foreign assistance in order to effectively defend the country.

The reasons for considering that the specific provisions of this new agreement are inconsistent with the Geneva Accords can be listed as follows:

(1) The agreement states that "under the requirements and restrictions of any US legislation, and based on the principles put forward in the first paragraph of the agreement reached between the two governments in 1951," the US government will provide assistance to Cambodia. According to the US Mutual Security Act of 1954, military assistance is provided to promote US foreign policy, security, and general welfare. At the same time, according to the same act, military assistance will not be provided to any country unless that country accepts certain obligations under Section 142 of the act. Some of these obligations have already been included in the agreement reached between Cambodia and the United States in 1951 and are reiterated in the note to the current agreement. If the obligations stipulated by the US Mutual Security Act are binding on Cambodia, then it cannot be said that the current military assistance agreement is only for effectively defending Cambodia.

(2) According to the third paragraph of the note, Cambodia promises to "make full contributions to the development and maintenance of its own and the free world's defense forces, according to its political and economic stability, and within the limits of its manpower, resources, equipment, and general economic conditions." Given the commitment to contribute to the "defense forces of the free world," it is difficult to say that the main text of the agreement is only for effectively defending the country. Moreover, the term "free world" implies participation in a new national group, which is incompatible with Cambodia's declared neutrality.

(3) According to Article 9 of the agreement, Cambodia promises to provide the United States or any other government with equipment, materials, services, and other assistance agreed upon by both parties to enhance their individual or collective defense capabilities. Even if this assistance to another country is subject to the consent of the Kingdom Government, military materials imported into Cambodia for self-defense and which may be conceivably used by others cannot be considered solely for Cambodia's self-defense. At the same time, although Cambodia is not a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, it may well be required under Article 9 to support any action of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, based on the grounds that such action is in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

(4) According to Section 2 of Annex A, the Kingdom Government agrees that materials and equipment transshipped through Cambodian territory to other US-aided countries or US military missions stationed in such countries will be exempt from taxes and duties. This is tantamount to importing weapons and equipment into Cambodia that are not strictly necessary for effectively defending the country. This free import into Cambodia or transshipment of military materials through Cambodia may overturn the strict arrangements and restrictions stipulated in the Geneva Accords regarding the import of military materials into the three Indochinese countries. Moreover, once a war breaks out in this region, this obligation will be inconsistent with Cambodia's neutrality. In view of the above, Cambodia's obligations under Annex A are considered to be contrary to the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

(5) Article 7 and Annex B of the agreement stipulate the procedures for handling surplus equipment and military materials. It is worrying that, in actual implementation, surplus inventories may be established in Cambodia, and at the same time, military materials may be directly transshipped from Cambodia to neighboring countries.

These objections have been raised to the Kingdom Government, and the Commission and the Government also discussed these objections to some extent at the meeting on May 30. From the statements and clarifications made by the Kingdom Government, we understand that the Kingdom Government's position on the above doubts is as follows:

(1) The Kingdom Government of Cambodia is not bound by the provisions of any US legislation, especially the Mutual Security Act. None of the provisions in the 1951 agreement between Cambodia and the United States govern the current agreement, except for the first paragraph reiterated in the note.

(2) The Kingdom Government believes that the term "free world" includes all freedom-loving countries, not just the Western bloc. Cambodia has declared that it will neither join the Western bloc nor the Eastern bloc, that it will not conclude any military alliances with any country, and that it will not allow the establishment of any foreign concessions on its territory. This position was already known to the US government before providing assistance under the current agreement. In this case, the Kingdom Government will not contribute to the defense forces of the free world unless its own security is dangerously threatened. Therefore, the obligations undertaken under paragraph 3 of the note are, for Cambodia, quite illusory until new circumstances arise.

(3) The Kingdom Government does not believe that handing over military materials and equipment strictly obtained for the effective defense of Cambodia to the United States or other countries for disposal in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 is contrary to the Geneva Accords, because such assistance will be provided in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. As for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Cambodia is not a member of this organization and is not bound by Article 9 of the new agreement to support any actions of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, unless it decides to do so to maintain the defense of its territory. At the same time, this concession is subject to the consent of both parties, and Cambodia can refuse to provide such assistance. Therefore, the obligations under Article 9 are not natural and cannot force Cambodia to provide assistance in all circumstances. Given its current neutrality, Cambodia does not envisage the possibility of providing such assistance materializing soon, unless its national security is involved.

(4) Cambodia has accepted the provisions regarding the transshipment of materials through its territory as a reciprocal action for materials coming through neighboring countries. This is an arrangement for peacetime, but if war breaks out in the region, neutral law will be invoked. In addition, Cambodia will abide by all the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding the import of military materials into the three Indochinese countries and will fully cooperate with the International Commission to inspect such military materials transshipped through Cambodia.

(5) Article 7 and Annex B stipulate the handling of unusable materials and waste. Once its minimum defense requirements are estimated, the Kingdom Government will notify the International Commission of the details of these requirements so that the Commission can regulate the entry of military materials and equipment. Therefore, in practice, the storage of materials is unlikely to occur. However, the Kingdom Government will guarantee to ship out of Cambodia any military materials that are surplus to its requirements; and the Cambodian government will not directly ship these materials from Cambodian warehouses to any neighboring countries.

As requested in Your Excellency's letter of June 17, 1955, the International Commission is concerned and states its position on the US-Cambodian military assistance agreement. To assist the Commission's work, the Commission requests you to confirm that our above description of Cambodia's position is correct.

Please accept, Your Excellency, the expression of my highest consideration.

Chairman of the International Commission
Patasarati
Phnom Penh, July 5, 1955

Please accept, Your Excellency, the expression of my highest consideration.

Minister of Foreign Affairs Lan Niete

### 柬埔寨国际委员会就美柬军事援助协定问题  向日内瓦会议两主席国提出临时报告

    柬埔寨国际委员会就美柬军事援助协定问题
    向日内瓦会议两主席国提出临时报告
    新华社十一日讯　柬埔寨国际委员会最近就美国和柬埔寨王国在一九五五年五月十六日签订的军事援助协定向日内瓦会议两主席国提出了第三次临时报告。
    报告提到，委员会认为，美柬军事援助协定的若干条款同日内瓦协定不符，要求王国政府加以澄清。越南民主共和国方面作为日内瓦会议参加国之
  一，并作为柬埔寨停战协定的签字人之一，曾致函国际委员会，抗议美柬军事援助协定违反了日内瓦协议。柬埔寨王国政府对美柬军事援助协定的若干条款的含义作了解释，并保证将严格遵守日内瓦协议和实行中立政策。王国政府保证它不受美国任何立法的约束，特别是共同安全法；保证不参加任何军事集团，不同外国订立军事同盟，也不向外国提供军事基地；并保证给予国际委员会充分合作，以监督作战物资的输入。据此，委员会于七月二十三日作了一项决议。决议欢迎王国政府对美柬军事援助协定所作的澄清和保证。决议同时指出，美柬军事援助协定的某些条款虽然是超出日内瓦协议的限制的，但是委员会愿意接受王国政府的保证，决议最后要求王国政府今后应切实履行那些保证，并在委员会根据日内瓦协议有关条款进行监督时给予充分的合作。
    报告并附有一九五五年七月五日国际委员会关于美柬军事援助协定致王国政府的信和七月十三日王国政府的复信。这两封信的全文如下：
    柬埔寨国际委员会印度主席
    给柬埔寨王国政府外交大臣的信阁下：
    我谨提到你一九五五年六月十七日第二二九三号CM的来信，其中要求国际委员会把我们对于美国和柬埔寨在一九五五年五月十六日签订的军事援助协定的意见告诉王国政府。
    国际委员会也接到了越南人民军总司令武元甲将军的抗议信，其中提出了越南民主共和国对美柬协定的观点。
    为了解问题的各方面，国际委员会不仅仔细地审阅了柬埔寨代表同美国代表之间的换文而且也仔细地审阅了王国政府对于军事援助协定所作的声明和你在一九五五年六月二十九日给我们的来信中所附的备忘录。国际委员会也考虑了阁下在一九五五年五月三十日向国际委员会所作的声明。
    国际委员会注意到了王国政府在一九五五年五月二十九日发表的公报，特别是以下所引的一段：
    “王国政府准备严密地和始终如一地尊重与它有关的日内瓦协议的条款和西哈努克陛下领导的代表团在亚非会议上以王国政府的名义所提出的谅解。政府再次赞同他对于柬埔寨的中立所作的声明。”
    上述的五月二十九日的公报还说：
    “因此，最近同美国签订的协定的目的是美国直接给予柬埔寨军事援助。谈不到让予军事基地，或者任何种类的军事同盟，或者派美国军事教官到柬埔寨来的问题。”
    王国政府于一九五四年七月二十日在日内瓦所作的声明中说（这一声明已包括在日内瓦协议的第七条和日内瓦会议最后宣言的第四段），柬埔寨不要求关于军事物资、人员和教官的外国援助，除非为了有效地保卫它的领土。
    柬埔寨从任何来源寻找外援的主权是没有疑问的，只要这种援助的唯一目的是组织它的有效保御。
    但是，新的军事援助协定的某些具体规定是否同日内瓦协议一致，已经令人怀疑，原因是，柬埔寨在这个新的协定下所承担的某些义务已经超出了像日内瓦协议所设想的一个协定的要求，这种协定的唯一目的是取得外援以便有效地保卫国家。
    认为这个新协定的具体规定同日内瓦协议不符的原因可以列述如下：
    （一）协定中说，“在美国任何立法的要求和限制下，并基于两国政府在一九五一年达成的协议中第一段所提出的原则”，美国政府将向柬埔寨提供援助。根据美国的一九五四年的共同安全法，给予军事援助是为了推进美国的外交政策、安全和一般的福利。同时，根据同一法案，将不向任何国家提供军事援助，除非这个国家接受该法案第一四二段之下的某些义务。这些义务中有一些已经包括在一九五一年柬埔寨和美国达成的协议之内，同时在目前的协定的附注中加以重申。如果美国共同安全法所规定的义务对柬埔寨有约束力，那就不能说目前的军事援助协定只是为了有效地保卫柬埔寨。
    （二）根据附注的第三段，柬埔寨答应“按照它的政治经济稳定的情况，并且在它的人力、资源、设备和一般经济情况允许的条件下，对它本身的和自由世界的防御力量的发展和维护，作出充分的贡献”。鉴于作出承诺，对“自由世界的防御力量”作出贡献，就很难说协定的主文只是为了有效地保卫国家。况且，“自由世界”的说法表示参加一个新的国家集团，这是同柬埔寨宣告的中立不协调的。
    （三）根据协定的第九款，柬埔寨答应向美国或任何他国政府提供装备、物资、服务和其他双方同意的援助，以便增强它们单独或集体防御的能力。即使这种对另外一个国家的援助要得到王国政府的同意，但是以自卫的理由运入柬埔寨而又可以设想被别人加以使用的军事物资不能被认为只是为了柬埔寨的自卫。同时，虽然柬埔寨不是东南亚条约组织的一员，但是它很可能被要求根据第九款对东南亚条约组织的任何行动给予支持，而所根据的理由是，这种行动是同联合国宪章的原则相符的。
    （四）根据附件甲的第二节，王国政府同意，经过柬埔寨的领土转运给其他接受美援的国家或者驻在这种国家的美国军事代表团的物资和装备，将免收税捐。这等于把不是为了有效地保卫国家所严格需要的武器和装备运入柬埔寨。这种自由运入柬埔寨或者通过柬埔寨转运军事物资，可能推翻日内瓦协议中对于把军事物资运入三个印度支那国家所规定的严格安排和限制。况且，一旦在这个地区进行战争时，这种义务将同柬埔寨的中立不符。鉴于以上所述，柬埔寨根据附件甲所承担的义务是被认为同日内瓦协议的规定相背的。
    （五）第七款和协定的附件乙规定了处理剩余的装备和军事物资的手续。令人担心的是，在实际的实施中，可能在柬埔寨设立剩余的存货，同时，军事物资也可能从柬埔寨直接转运到邻近的国家。
    这些反对意见已经向王国政府提出，委员会和政府在五月三十日会晤时也在某种程度上讨论了这些反对意见。从王国政府所作的声明和澄清，我们了解，王国政府对于上述各点怀疑所采取的立场如下：
    （一）柬埔寨王国政府不受美国任何立法的规定的约束，特别是共同安全法。一九五一年柬埔寨和美国的协议中没有一个条款支配目前的协定，在附注中复述的第一段除外。
    （二）王国政府认为“自由世界”一词包括所有爱好自由的国家，不仅仅是西方集团。柬埔寨已经声明，它将既不参加西方集团，也不参加东方集团，它将不同任何国家缔结任何军事同盟，它将不容许在它的领土上建立任何外国租让地。这个立场，在根据目前的协定提供援助以前，早已是美国政府所知道的。在这种情况下，王国政府将不对自由世界的防御力量作出贡献，除非它本身的安全危险地受到威胁。因此，在新的情况发生以前，根据附注第三段所承担的义务，对柬埔寨来说，是相当空幻的。
    （三）王国政府不认为，把严格地为了有效保卫柬埔寨而取得的军事物资和装备根据第九款的规定交由美国或其他国家处理，是同日内瓦协议相背的，因为这种援助将是根据联合国宪章的原则而提供的。至于东南亚条约组织，柬埔寨并不是这个组织的一员，并且不受新协定第九款的约束来支持东南亚条约组织的任何行动，除非它决定这样作以维护对本国领土的防御。同时，这个让步是要得到双方的同意的，柬埔寨可以拒绝给予这种援助。因此，在第九款之下的义务不是自然而然的，不能强迫柬埔寨在一切情况下提供援助。鉴于它目前的中立，柬埔寨并不设想提供这种援助的可能性加速到来，除非牵涉到了它的国家安全。
    （四）柬埔寨接受了关于通过它的领土转运物资的规定，作为对于经过邻近国家而来的物资的一个互惠的行动。这是和平时期的安排，但是如果在这个地区爆发战事，中立法将被引用。此外，柬埔寨将遵守日内瓦协议中关于把军事物资运入三个印度支那国家的一切规定，并且将同国际委员会充分合作，以检查通过柬埔寨转运的这种军事物资。
    （五）第七款和附件乙规定了不能用的物资和废料的处理。一旦它在防务方面的最低要求估定以后，王国政府将通知国际委员会这些要求的细节，以便委员会可以管制军事物资和装备的入境。因此，实际上物资的储存不可能发生。但是，王国政府将保证把对它的要求来说是多余的任何军事物资运出柬埔寨；并且不由柬埔寨政府把这些物资从柬埔寨的仓库直接运给任何邻国。
    正如阁下在一九五五年六月十七日来信中所要求的，国际委员会感到忧虑并申述它对美柬军事援助协定的立场。为了帮助委员会的工作。委员会请求你证实我们以上对柬埔寨立场的叙述是正确的。
    请阁下接受我最崇高的敬礼。
                      国际委员会主席
                            帕塔萨拉蒂
                    一九五五年七月五日于金边
    柬埔寨王国政府给国际委员会主席的信主席先生：
    谨收到您一九五五年七月五日关于美国给予柬埔寨直接军事援助的来信。
    兹证实在一九五五年五月三十日国际委员会委员们同王国政府官员举行的会议上我所声明的和您上述来信中所申述的关于柬埔寨立场的概念是正确的。
    请阁下接受我最崇高的敬礼。
