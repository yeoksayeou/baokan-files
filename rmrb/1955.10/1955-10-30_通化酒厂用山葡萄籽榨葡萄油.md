    Tonghua Winery Uses Wild Grape Seeds to Extract Grape Seed Oil
    The local state-owned Tonghua Winery has successfully trial-produced grape seed oil using wild grape seeds. Wild grapes are the main raw material for the winery's production. In the past, apart from squeezing the grape juice for wine making, the remaining grape seeds were always considered useless. This year, during the increase production and practice economy movement, after research and testing by the factory's technicians, it was discovered that grape seeds contain a large amount of grape seed oil (approximately 13 jin of grape seed oil per 100 jin of seeds). Therefore, in July and August, they pressed tens of thousands of jin of grape seeds left over from last year, resulting in more than 3,000 jin of grape seed oil.
    Grape seed oil has a wide range of uses. It can be used as fuel and high-grade lubricating oil in industrial construction, as well as for lighting and as a raw material for soap making. The cake residue after oil extraction can also be used as feed, fertilizer, and "tartaric acid."
    Currently, this factory is preparing to complete the two processes of cleaning and drying the grape seeds produced from this year's wild grape harvest within the fourth quarter, in preparation for oil extraction in the future. (Fan Jingfu)

    通化酒厂用山葡萄籽榨葡萄油
    地方国营通化葡萄酒厂用山葡萄籽试榨葡萄油成功。山葡萄是这个厂生产的主要原料。过去，除了挤出葡萄汁做酒外，剩下的葡萄籽一直被认为是无用之物。今年在增产节约运动中，经过厂里技术人员研究、化验后，发现葡萄籽中含有大量葡萄油（每百斤约有葡萄油十三斤左右）。于是就在七、八月间把去年残存的数万斤葡萄籽进行压榨，结果榨出葡萄油三千多斤。
    葡萄油的用途很广，它可以做工业建设中的燃料和高级的滑润油，还可以做照明用油和做肥皂原料。榨油后的饼粕还能做饲料、肥料和“酒石酸”。
    目前，这个厂正在准备把今年收购山葡萄所产出来的葡萄籽，在第四季度内完成清洗、干燥二个工序，准备将来榨油。　（樊景孚）
