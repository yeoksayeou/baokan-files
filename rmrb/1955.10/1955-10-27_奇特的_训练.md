    Strange "Training"
    The American "Newsweek" published a "field report." It said that at Stead Air Force Base in Nevada, American soldiers are undergoing a special kind of training. The training lasts for seventeen days, but the main training phase only lasts about a day and a half. Before entering the main training phase, trainees must spend ten days of wilderness living on mountains as high as seven thousand feet with two and a half days of rations. After ten days, those who fail to escape and are "captured" are "bound together and made to run barefoot in a death march to the corral." "There, they pick up stones, sleep on the ground without blankets (even in the summer nights the temperature drops to near freezing), and live on 'Bloody Mary' (which is: coffee with uncooked spinach and raw macaroni, plus beets to make it red, and eaten lukewarm)."
    The "field report" wrote: "All this is just the opening act of a thirty-six-hour interrogation phase." So, what is the main act like? The author described it this way: "During the interrogation, a small hand-cranked generator is used, which can give people harmless (but often terrifying) shocks; underground 'holes' are ten feet deep, and people stand in them for hours with water up to their shoulders; there are also airtight 'coffins' where the trainees sleep on the stone floor; and steel 'cells' where there is plenty of time to decide what the worst encounter is: whether to endure the pain of squatting motionless in a space too small to sit, lie down, or stand, or to endure the tinnitus caused by the guard hitting the steel box with the butt of a rifle. ... Or, they kneel on a broom, holding large stones with their arms raised...". Accompanying these tortures are endless insults and abusive interrogations.
    These horrifying "training" methods are not fabrications of bourgeois journalists. Colonel MacKenzie, commander of the Stead Air Force Base who presides over the "training," has confirmed that it is indeed the case. MacKenzie himself was a prisoner of the Nazis in World War II, but he admitted that this is even worse than the inhumane torture of Nazi concentration camps.
    American Air Force Secretary Quarles is "very satisfied" with this kind of training, believing it is "certainly justified." As a result, this training has become popular. A building costing $4.1 million has already begun construction. According to reports, "the Air Force hopes to eventually send every combat pilot to Stead for training once every three years." In addition, as revealed by three U.S. Air Force officers in an interview with reporters from "U.S. News & World Report," this "training" is conducted not only at Stead Air Force Base, but also in West Germany and Japan.
    Strangely, why is such barbaric and cruel training being carried out on regular army personnel during peacetime? A U.S. military official said that the purpose of this training is to "prepare these soldiers for the terrible life of a prisoner of war."
    This is even stranger. The recent international situation is trending towards relaxation. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' recent speeches have repeatedly expressed the United States' hope for peace. It is difficult to understand why, when U.S. government officials are constantly chanting about peace, U.S. military authorities are worried about the "terrible life of prisoners of war" for American soldiers.

### 奇特的“训练”

    奇特的“训练”
    美国“新闻周刊”登载了一篇“现场报告”。据说，在内华达州斯特德空军基地里，美国士兵正受着一种特殊的训练，训练的时间是十七天，但是主要的训练阶段却是在一天半左右的时间内。受训者在进入主要训练阶段之前，要带着两天半的口粮在高达七千英尺的山上过十天的野外生活。十天之后，那些逃避不及而被“俘掳”的人，“被捆在一起赤着脚作一次的连跑带走的死亡进军到围场里去。”“在那里捡石头、睡在不垫毯子的地上（甚至在夏季夜里的温度都下降到接近冰点），靠吃‘嗜血的玛丽’为生（这种东西是：咖啡加上没有煮过的菠菜和生通心粉，另外加甜菜使变为红色，并且是在微温的时候吃）。”
    “现场报道”写道：“所有这些，不过是三十六小时诘问阶段的开幕戏”。那么，正戏是怎么样的呢？作者是这样叙述的：“在诘问的时候，应用一架小型曲柄发电机，这种发电机可给人以没有害处（但是常常很可怕）的震动；地下的‘洞’有十英尺深，人在里面一连站几小时，水一直漫到肩膀；还有密不通风的‘棺材’，受训的人睡在它的铺着石头的底上；还有钢制的‘牢房’，在里面有很多时间供你决定什么是最坏的遭遇：究竟是在一个小得连坐、卧或站都嫌太小的空间中忍受因为一动不动地蹲着而产生的痛苦呢，还是忍受卫兵以来福枪柄敲击这个钢匣而引起的耳鸣。……或者，他们跪在一把扫帚上，两臂举着大石头……”。伴随着这些毒刑而来的，是无休止的谩骂、侮辱性的诘问。
    这种种骇人听闻的“训练”，并非资产阶级记者的虚构捏造。主持“训练”的斯特德空军基地司令部麦肯齐上校就证实了是确有其事。麦肯齐本人在第二次世界大战中曾当过纳粹的俘虏，但是他承认，这比纳粹集中营的惨无人道的酷刑还要厉害。
    美国空军部长卡利斯对这种训练感到“很满意”，认为它“肯定是正当的”。于是，这种训练便流行起来了。一个花费四百一十万美元的建筑已经开工。据报道，“空军希望最后能把每一名作战飞行员都送到斯特德去每三年训练一次。”此外，据三名美国空军军官在接见“美国新闻与世界报道”的记者时所透露，这种“训练”除了在斯特德空军基地进行之外，在西德和日本也都设有同样的训练营。
    奇怪的是，为什么要在和平时期对常规军队的人员施行这种野蛮残酷的训练呢？一位美国军方人士说，这种训练的目的，是“使这些军人对可怕的战俘生活作好准备”。
    这就更加奇怪了。最近国际形势正在趋向缓和。美国国务卿杜勒斯最近的几次演说，也一再表示美国希望和平。人们难以理解的是：当美国政府的官员口口声声在叨念和平的时候，为什么美国军事当局却为美国军人的“可怕的战俘生活”担忧起来呢？
