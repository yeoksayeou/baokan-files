    On Woodblock Watermark Painting

                       I
    The "Rong Bao Zhai Woodblock Watermark Painting Exhibition," sponsored by the Chinese Artists Association and the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, opened in the capital on October 2nd. The content of these exhibits and their national style are very attractive to the audience.
    China's colored ink paintings (i.e., traditional Chinese paintings), despite their tortuous development process, are consistent in content and form with the traditional artistic appreciation habits of the broad masses of the Chinese people. Woodblock watermark printing is a reproduction method that adapts to the national characteristics of colored ink paintings. This woodblock watermark, a printing art with unique artistic effects, uses paper, silk, watercolors, etc., similar to the original, and is repeatedly printed by precise manual woodcut blocks to achieve a degree of similarity or consistency with the original. From woodblock watermark paintings, we can see the high skill of China's woodblock watermark art. The carving and printing artists, according to the content and brushwork of the original painting, wield the knife like a brush, and apply colors like painting, achieving both meticulous detail and bold and unrestrained expression. Whether it is the vigorous and broken lines of dry brush or the rippling wateriness of saturated ink, they can all be expressed vividly and appropriately, so that the content of the original work and the artistic effect embodying this content appear in this reproduction without any difference. Therefore, this kind of woodblock watermark painting can be said to be a re-creation, a re-creation through the careful cooperation of colored ink painters and tracing, engraving, and watermark artists.
                          II
    The more than four hundred woodblock watermark paintings on display show that our national art is extremely rich and colorful. Here, we truly see the ancient art of the Dunhuang murals, and we also see faithfully some ancient famous paintings such as the Tang Dynasty masterpiece "Court Ladies Wearing Flowers," as well as some ancient lacquerware patterns. In addition, the largest number are ancient, modern, and contemporary colored ink paintings of flowers, birds, insects, and landscapes, as well as the Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Calligraphy and Painting, the Rong Bao Zhai Poetry Letter Paper, folk paper cuttings, etc. All the exhibited paintings undoubtedly give the audience a profound impression, that is: these woodblock watermark paintings are popular art that promotes our national painting, enriches the people's cultural life, and inspires their optimistic, healthy, and progressive emotions.
    Rong Bao Zhai is currently the only publisher of woodblock watermark paintings in China. They have accumulated valuable experience in this area and have achieved gratifying results. It should be pointed out that this is the result of the elderly and young artists engaged in this work inheriting China's tradition of woodblock printing for more than a thousand years, and carefully cooperating and working diligently with colored ink painters. At the same time, we have not forgotten that China's woodblock watermark painting work, before liberation, had experienced a considerably long period of bleak neglect. Only after liberation, under the strong advocacy and support of the Party and the government, did it achieve prosperity, development, and elevation to an unprecedented level and a new stage of serving the people.
                         III
    While welcoming the new achievements of China's woodblock watermark paintings, people are also concerned about its further development and improvement.
    Obviously, in terms of China's extremely rich national painting heritage, there are still many that are suitable for reproduction by woodblock watermark but have not yet been reproduced. Judging from the exhibits at the exhibition, the introduction of China's classical national painting is very insufficient in quantity, and also somewhat monotonous, and not rich and diverse enough; in this regard, the relevant departments need to work together to do more work. As for modern colored ink paintings, even fewer have been reproduced and introduced, and closer cooperation must be achieved with modern colored ink painters to introduce more modern colored ink paintings that reflect realistic content.
    At the same time, we have an extremely rich, complete, and valuable art tradition of folk woodblock prints, such as the woodblock New Year pictures from Yangliuqing in Tianjin, Taohuawu in Suzhou, Weixian in Shandong, and Yangzhou in Jiangsu, all of which have extremely healthy and simple artistic styles and a very broad range of enthusiasts, especially the working people. Our woodblock watermark paintings should inherit and carry forward this folk art tradition in order to improve the skills of woodcutting and watermark printing. On the other hand, we should also absorb the excellent woodblock printing techniques of other countries, just as we absorbed some Japanese printing techniques in "Court Ladies Wearing Flowers," so that our woodblock paintings can become richer.
    In order to meet the growing needs of the broad masses of people for cultural life and the preferences of people abroad, we look forward to the further development and improvement of woodblock watermark paintings.

    谈木版水印画
    邵宇
                       一
    由中国美术家协会和人民美术出版社主办的“荣宝齐木版水印画展览”，于十月二日在首都开始展出，这些展品的内容和它的民族风格，对观众很有吸引力。
    我国的彩墨画（即国画），尽管有着曲折的发展过程，它的内容和表现形式，是同我国广大人民传统的艺术欣赏习惯一致的。而木版水印画，正是适应彩墨画的民族特点的一种复制品。这种木版水印，具有独特艺术效果的印刷艺术，它用同原作相仿的纸、绢、水色等等，经过精确的人工木刻版，多次地套印出来，达到同原作近似或一致的程度。从木版水印画上，我们可以看到我国木版水印艺术的高度技巧。刻版和印刷艺人们，根据原画的内容和笔意，持刀如笔，设色如画，既可做到细致入微，也可做到粗犷奔放，无论是枯笔的劲健断续，饱墨的水意荡漾，都能表达尽致，恰到好处，使原作的内容和体现这种内容的艺术效果，并无二致地出现在这种复制品上。因此这种木版水印画，可以说是一种再创作，是彩墨画家同钩描、雕版、水印艺人精心合力的再创作。
                          二
    展出的四百多幅木版水印画，表现了我们的民族艺术是极其丰富多采的。在这里，我们真切地看到了我国古老的敦煌壁画艺术，也如实地看到了唐代名画“簪花仕女图”那样的一些古代名画，还有一些古代的漆器图案。此外，为数最多的，是古代的、近代的和现代的花鸟、草虫和山水等彩墨画，以及十竹斋笺谱、荣宝斋诗笺谱、民间剪纸等。所有展出的画幅，毫无疑义地给了观众一个深刻的印象，就是说：这些木版水印画，是发扬我国民族绘画，丰富人民文化生活，并借以激发他们乐观、健康、前进的情绪的一种普及的美术品。
    荣宝斋在目前是我国唯一的木版水印画出版者，在这方面他们积累了宝贵经验，并获得了可喜的成绩。应当指出，这是由于从事此项工作的老年和青年艺人们，继承了我国一千多年来的木版印刷传统，并同彩墨画家精心合作和勤勤恳恳劳动的结果。同时，我们也没有忘记，我国的木版水印画的工作，在解放前，曾经经历过相当长期的惨淡冷落的年月，只有解放以后，在党和政府的大力倡导和支持下，才得到了繁荣、发展，并提高到空前未有的水平和为人民群众服务的新阶段。
                         三
    人们在欢迎我国木版水印画的新成就的同时，也关怀着它进一步的发展和提高。
    很显然，就我国极其丰富的民族绘画遗产来说，适合于以木版水印来复制而尚未复制的还很多，从展览会的展品来看，介绍我国古典民族绘画，在数量上是非常不够的，而且还有些单调，不够丰富多样；在这方面还需要有关部门的协同努力，做更多的工作。就现代的彩墨画来说，复制介绍出来的就更少，必须同现代彩墨画家取得更密切的合作，介绍更多反映现实内容的现代彩墨画作品。
    同时，我们有着极其丰富的完整的宝贵的民间木版画的艺术传统，诸如天津杨柳青、苏州桃花坞、山东潍县和江苏扬州等地的木版年画，都有着极其健康纯朴的艺术风格，拥有非常广大的爱好者，特别是劳动人民。我们的木版水印画应该继承和发扬这一民间的艺术传统，以提高木刻和水印的技巧。另一方面也要吸收其他国家优秀的木版印刷技巧，如同在“簪花仕女图”中吸收了日本的某些印刷技巧那样，使得我国的木版画，更加丰富起来。
    为了满足广大人民日益增长的文化生活的需要和国外人士的爱好，我们期待着木版水印画更进一步的发展和提高。
