Geological exploration work for the Liujiaxia Hydropower Hub Project in the middle reaches of the Yellow River has entered its most intense phase. Six drilling rigs stand tall on the cliffs of the more than eleven-kilometer-long canyon. More than one hundred drilling workers are working around the clock in three shifts. Now, drilling hole number thirteen has completed 50% of the hole's annual workload, and drilling hole number eleven has completed 40% of the hole's annual workload. For drilling hole number fourteen in the center of the river, workers have erected a cable bridge on the steep cliffside, which is as high as one hundred meters, and sunk the first twelve-inch diameter casing pipe into the roaring torrent. Drilling will soon officially begin on the water. Other river center drilling holes are also being actively prepared. More than one hundred geological surveyors climb cliffs, mountains, and ridges every day to carry out geological surface work. In September, they completed the geological map of the dam site area, etc. Migrant workers from Yongjing and Gaolan counties, under the guidance and leadership of skilled technicians, are carrying out adit, test pit, and test trench work, fighting against the hard rock.

The main task of the Liujiaxia Hydropower Hub Project this year is to conduct exploration at the Malugou, Taohekou, and Hongliugou dam sites to understand the rock properties, geological structure, and permeability of the dam sites, in order to select the best dam site for building a dam. Due to the large scale of this year's geological drilling tasks, the Gansu Provincial Department of Industry, the Gansu Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, the Northwest Geological Bureau, and the Bridge Engineering Team of the First Engineering Bureau have all sent many technical workers to support. Yongjing County and Gaolan County have also mobilized many young and strong migrant workers to cooperate with the smooth progress of this huge project.

    刘家峡枢纽工程地质勘探工作紧张进行
    黄河中游刘家峡水力枢纽工程的地质勘探工作已进入最紧张的阶段。在十一公里多长的峡谷峭壁上耸立起六台钻机。一百多个钻探职工分作三班日夜不停地工作。现在十三号钻孔已钻进该孔年工作量的百分之五十，十一号钻孔已钻进该钻孔年工作量百分之四十。河中心的十四号钻孔，工人们已在高达一百公尺的岸边陡崖上架起了钢丝桥，在咆哮奔腾的急流中沉下直径十二吋的第一根套管，不久即要在水上正式开钻。另外几个河心钻孔也在积极准备中，一百多地质测量人员天天攀登悬崖峭壁、爬山越岭、进行地质地面工作。在九月份他们已完成坝址区的地质图等工作。来自永靖和皋兰县的民工，在熟练技术工人的带动和指导下，进行着平峒、试坑、试槽工作，向坚硬的岩石作斗争。
    刘家峡水力枢纽工程今年的主要任务，是在马六沟、洮河口、红柳沟三个比较坝址进行勘探，了解坝址的岩石性质、地质构造和渗透性能，以便从中选出一个最优良的可供建筑拦河坝的坝址。由于今年地质钻探任务的规模巨大，甘肃省工业厅、甘肃省水利局、西北地质局和第一工程局桥梁工程队都抽出许多技术职工前去支援。永靖县、皋兰县为了配合这一巨大工程的顺利进行也出动了很多青壮年民工。
