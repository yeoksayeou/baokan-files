Xinhua News Agency, October 11th: Many of the country's larger paper mills are paying attention to conserving raw materials and improving product quality.

In the past, each factory used approximately 1,100 kilograms of pulp to produce one ton of paper. Now, the most economical factories use only 840 kilograms of pulp to produce one ton of paper. Except for a few thin papers, the general pulp consumption is already below 1,080 kilograms. From January to July this year, twenty-three state-owned and jointly state-private paper mills under central management nationwide have already saved 4.67 million yuan, conserving more than 3,700 cubic meters of wood, more than 3,000 tons of reeds, and more than 200 tons of pulp. According to statistics from eighteen factories, costs have been reduced by 3.6 percent compared to the plan.

The quality of paper produced by these twenty-three factories has also improved compared to the past. Last year, first-class paper accounted for only 82 percent of production, but in the first half of this year, it has increased to 84.6 percent. The paper's qualification rate has also increased from 91.74 percent to 95.19 percent.

The main reason why factories can save raw materials while ensuring quality is that they can rationally conserve raw materials by improving papermaking technology and business management. Shanghai China Paper Company and Kaishantun Paper Mill have added fillers such as talc and kaolin in the papermaking process, saving a lot of raw materials, and the paper produced is smoother and flatter than before. Some factories try to retain more pentose contained in the reeds when cooking them, which can produce more pulp and improve the quality of the pulp. Wood pulp mills and paper mills using wood pulp are finding ways to use waste wood, rags, rotten hemp, and rotten cotton instead of good wood as raw materials, which can also produce high-quality paper.

    许多造纸厂努力节约原料和提高产品质量
    新华社十一日讯　全国许多较大的造纸工厂注意节约原材料和提高产品质量。
    以往，各厂造一吨纸大约要用一千一百公斤纸浆，现在最节省的工厂造一吨纸只用八百四十公斤纸浆，除少数薄纸外，一般的用纸浆量已在一千零八十公斤以下。今年一月到七月，全国二十三个国营和中央管理的公私合营造纸厂已经节省了四百六十七万元，节约了木材三千七百多立方公尺、芦苇三千多吨、纸浆二百多吨。据十八个工厂的统计，成本比计划降低了百分之三点六。
    这二十三个工厂所出产的纸张的质量也比以往提高了。去年生产的一等纸只占百分之八十二，今年上半年已提高到百分之八十四点六，纸张的合格率也从百分之九十一点七四提高到百分之九十五点一九。
    各工厂既能节省原料又能保证质量的主要原因，是能从改进造纸技术和企业管理方面来合理地节约原材料。上海中国版纸公司和开山屯造纸厂在造纸过程中增加了滑石粉和白土等填料，节约了很多原料，造出来的纸却比原来更光滑更平整。有的工厂在蒸煮芦苇时设法使芦苇中所含的戊炭醣多保留一些，就能多出一些纸浆，还能改进纸浆的质量。木浆厂和用木浆的造纸厂想办法使一些废木材、破布、烂麻、烂棉花来代替好木料做原料，也能制出高级纸来。
