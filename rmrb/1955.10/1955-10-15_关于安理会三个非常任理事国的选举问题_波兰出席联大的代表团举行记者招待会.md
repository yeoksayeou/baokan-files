Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 13th: According to TASS, the head of the Polish delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, Katz-Suchy, held a press conference on the 12th regarding the upcoming election of three non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (elected by the United Nations General Assembly every two years).

At the meeting, Katz-Suchy mentioned that according to the London Agreement of 1946, one of the non-permanent seats on the Security Council should be given to an Eastern European country, and Poland had already submitted its candidacy to the Security Council on June 1, 1955.

Katz-Suchy pointed out that the London Agreement had been recognized and adhered to for many years. However, in 1953, the non-permanent seat in the Security Council designated for Eastern Europe was occupied by Turkey, a representative from another region. Now that Turkey's term is expiring, the Philippines has been nominated as a candidate with the support of some countries. However, the Philippines has no right to represent Eastern Europe.

Katz-Suchy drew attention to the fact that the United States, as one of the major countries participating in the London Agreement, is disregarding its obligations and putting forward the Philippines as a candidate for the Eastern European seat on the Security Council.

Katz-Suchy said: In order to weaken the support of Asian, African, and Near Eastern countries for Poland's candidacy, some delegations are talking about expanding the representation of Asian countries in the United Nations organization. In this regard, they also cited the recommendations of the Bandung Conference. He said: "Poland fully supports the desire of Asian countries to obtain due representation in international organizations. However, this cannot and should not be achieved at the expense of the interests of other countries." He said: "Using the Bandung Conference to justify the destruction of existing obligations and harm international cooperation is contrary to the spirit of the Bandung Conference resolutions and is a violation of the decisions of this conference. This position has been widely recognized by qualified people in Asian and Arab countries, who also believe that our position on the Security Council election issue is reasonable and correct."

Katz-Suchy concluded by saying that depriving Eastern European countries of their legitimate seat on the Security Council is contrary to the highest standards of international behavior that the United Nations organization should follow.

    关于安理会三个非常任理事国的选举问题
    波兰出席联大的代表团举行记者招待会
    新华社十四日讯　据塔斯社纽约十三日讯：联合国大会波兰代表团团长卡茨—苏希十二日就即将举行的联合国安全理事会三个非常任理事国的选举（由联合国大会每两年选举一次）的问题举行记者招待会。
    卡茨—苏希在会上提到，根据一九四六年的伦敦协定，安全理事会中的一个非常任理事国的席位应该给予东欧国家，波兰已经在一九五五年六月一日在安全理事会中提出了自己的候选人。
    卡茨—苏希指出，伦敦协定许多年来一直得到承认和遵守。但是在一九五三年，安全理事会中给予东欧的一个非常任理事国席位被另一个地域的代表土耳其占据了。现在土耳其任期届满，菲律宾又在一些国家的支持下被提名为候选人。而菲律宾是不可能有权代表东欧的。
    卡茨—苏希提醒注意这样一个事实：美国身为参与伦敦协定的大国之一，竟不顾自己承担的义务，提出菲律宾作为安全理事会东欧国家席位的候选人。
    卡茨—苏希说：为了削弱亚洲、非洲和近东国家对波兰候选人的支持，某些代表团谈到要扩大亚洲国家在联合国组织机构中的代表权。在这方面，它们并且援引了万隆会议的建议。他说：“波兰完全支持亚洲国家要求在国际组织中获得应有的代表权的愿望。但是，这不能也不应当靠损害其他一些国家的利益来达到。”他说：“以万隆会议来为破坏现有的义务和使国际合作遭受损害辩解，这是违反万隆会议决议的精神的，并且是违反这个会议的决定的。这种立场已经得到亚洲和阿拉伯国家的有资格人士的普遍承认，他们并且认为我们对安全理事会选举问题所采取的立场是合理的和正确的。”
    卡茨—苏希最后说，剥夺东欧国家在安全理事会中的合法席位是同联合国组织应该遵循的国际行为最高准则相抵触的。
