Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 21st: “Pravda” published an article by Litoshenko discussing the recent developments in the American workers' movement to defend peace. The article stated that American organized workers are increasingly resolute in demanding that negotiations between governments continue and advocate restraining those who openly oppose the "Geneva Spirit."

    The leadership of the Electrical Workers Union, affiliated with the AFL, welcomed the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit, believing that the conference demonstrated that international problems should be resolved at the negotiating table rather than through the use of atomic bombs. Many union newspapers and prominent American labor leaders have also made similar statements.

    The two thousand delegates to the California State Federation of Labor convention, representing 1.3 million organized workers, demanded the adoption of a policy that would lead to the implementation of disarmament plans and the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

    This year's American "Labor Day" (September 5th) celebrations fully demonstrated the American working people's desire for peace and determination to fight for the realization of the "Geneva Spirit." On this day, many towns held traditional workers' demonstrations, conferences, and rallies. As can be seen from reports in American newspapers, these celebrations were held under the slogan of the "Geneva Spirit" and in the context of the growing unity of the American labor movement.

    American workers are increasingly interested in the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers Conference. They expect this conference to make concrete decisions on consolidating world peace and international security. Recently, the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America passed a resolution demanding that the U.S. government meet the upcoming Foreign Ministers Conference with the spirit and understanding of the Geneva Four-Power Summit.

    美国工人希望和平要求促进“日内瓦精神”
    新华社二十二日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：“真理报”刊载利托希科的一篇文章，谈到最近美国工人进一步展开保卫和平运动的情况。文章说，美国有组织的工人愈来愈坚决地要求各国政府间的谈判必须继续，并且主张抑制那些公开反对“日内瓦精神”的人。
    属于劳联的电气工人工会的领导机关欢迎日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的结果，认为这次会议说明了应该在会议桌上而不是通过使用原子弹来解决国际问题。许多工会报纸和美国著名劳工领袖也都发表了类似的言论。
    代表着一百三十万有组织的工人的加利福尼亚州劳联代表大会的两千个代表要求采取一种能够导致实施裁军计划和禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的政策。
    今年美国“劳工节”（九月五日）的庆祝活动更是充分表明了美国劳动人民的和平意愿和为实现“日内瓦精神”而斗争的决心。在这一天，许多市镇都举行了传统的工人示威、会议和集会。从美国报纸的报道中可以看出，这些庆祝活动都是在“日内瓦精神”的口号下和美国工人运动日趋团结的情况下举行的。
    美国工人对于就要开幕的四国外交部长会议愈来愈感到兴趣。他们期望这个会议将对巩固世界和平和国际安全作出具体决定。不久前，美国联合电气、无线电与机器工人工会的代表大会通过了一项决议，要求美国政府以日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的精神和谅解来迎接即将到来的外交部长会议。
