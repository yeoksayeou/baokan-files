    Lhasa Holds Agricultural, Pastoral, Cultural, Educational, and Health Exhibition
    The Lhasa Agricultural, Pastoral, Cultural, Educational, and Health Exhibition, which opened on National Day, has received more than 16,000 visitors in just a few days.

    In the agricultural exhibition hall, among the more than 250 varieties of agricultural products successfully cultivated by the Lhasa Agricultural Experimental Farm and People's Liberation Army soldiers on the plateau, a 46-斤 (jin) lotus cabbage and a 1-斤 12-两 (liang) tomato are particularly popular. Vegetables and melons originally grown in the interior, such as eggplants, green beans, beets, cucumbers, gourds, cantaloupes, oriental picks, and Hami melons, are grown on the plateau for the first time. Among the exhibited grain crops is the Soviet winter black wheat, sown for the first time this year, which can yield more than 900 斤 per mu.

    In the animal husbandry exhibition hall, there are displays of "long-haired sheep" wool from Qiangtang, fine wool cashmere from the vicinity of Yamdrok Lake, more than 60 kinds of dairy products such as ghee and cheese, as well as various saddles, leather boots, wine vessels, and brightly colored flower skirts and pulu fabrics produced in Lhasa, Gyantse, and Shannan. The samples of more than 160 kinds of veterinary instruments and medicines provided by the country to support Tibet, as well as the cattle plague serum and vaccine newly produced by the Lhasa Veterinary Serum Factory, have been praised by the herdsmen.

    In the cultural and educational exhibition hall, the parents of Lhasa primary school students are satisfied to browse through their children's Tibetan compositions, arithmetic exercise books, and paintings. A painting by eight-year-old Qiangba Dengda depicts Tibetan representatives presenting hadas to Chairman Mao, and eleven-year-old Zeren made a watercolor painting of "Liberating Taiwan." Among the exhibited handicrafts is a model of Tiananmen Square collectively sculpted by the children. The health exhibition hall displayed more than 30 sets of valuable medical equipment supported by the motherland for the Lhasa People's Hospital, among which the newly transported infant incubator particularly aroused the interest of Tibetan women.

    Outside the exhibition hall, a combine harvester is giving a demonstration of wheat threshing. Next to this huge machine are many five-furrow plows and universal cultivators, all of which have just been transported from the interior.

    The exhibition has left a very good impression on the Tibetan people. Kalon Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme of the Tibetan local government said after the visit: In just a few years, Tibet has been able to achieve such great success, and the people from all walks of life must be very happy to see it.

    拉萨举办农牧文教卫生展览
    在国庆节开幕的拉萨农、牧、文教、卫生展览会在几天中已接待了一万六千多个观众。
    这个展览会农业展览室展出的拉萨的农业试验场和解放军战士在高原上培植成功的二百五十多个品种的农产品中，一颗重四十六斤的莲花白菜和一斤十二两重的大蕃茄特别惹人喜爱。原来生长在内地的茄子、菜豆、甜菜、黄瓜、葫芦、香瓜、醉瓜、哈密瓜等鲜美瓜菜，都第一次在高原上生长出来。展览的粮食作物中有今年第一次播种的苏联冬黑麦，每亩能收九百多斤。
    在畜牧业展览室里，陈列着羌塘出产的“长毛羊”毛，羊卓雍湖滨一带的细毛羊绒和六十多种酥油、干酪等乳制食品，还有各种各样的马具、皮靴、酒器和拉萨、江孜、山南等地出产的色泽鲜丽的花裙、氆氇等毛织品。国家支援西藏的一百六十多种兽医器械和药剂的样品，拉萨兽疫防治血清制造厂新制出的牛瘟血清和疫苗，受到牧民们的称赞。
    拉萨小学学生的家长们在文教展览室里满意地翻阅着孩子们的藏文作文、算术草本和图画。八岁的强巴登达所作的画上画着藏族代表把哈达献给毛主席，十一岁的泽仁作了一幅“解放台湾”的水彩画，在展览的手工作业中，有一座孩子们集体塑造的天安门模型。卫生展览室里展出了祖国支援拉萨人民医院的三十多套贵重的医疗器械，其中新运到的婴儿培养箱特别引起藏族妇女们的兴趣。
    在展览室外，一部联合收割机正在作小麦脱粒表演。在这座庞大的机器旁边还陈列着许多五铧犁和万能中耕器，这些农业机械都是刚从内地运来的。
    展览会在藏族人民中留下了十分美好的印象。西藏地方政府噶伦阿沛·阿旺晋美在参观后说：在短短几年中，西藏能得到这么大的成就，各界人民看了一定非常高兴。　　　（新华社）
