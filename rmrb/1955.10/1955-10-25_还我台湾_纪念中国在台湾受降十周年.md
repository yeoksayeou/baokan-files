Give Us Back Taiwan
— Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of China Accepting Japan’s Surrender in Taiwan
Li Chunqing, Vice Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League

    On October 25, 1945, China accepted the surrender of Japan's Taiwan Governor-General Ando Rikichi in Taiwan. On that day, China's representative Chen Yi broadcast to the world: "From today onwards, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are formally returned to the territory of China. All land, people, and political affairs are placed under the sovereignty of the Chinese government." From that day on, Taiwan was returned to China.

    Ten years ago, Taiwan had already been returned to China. Now, the United States is forcibly occupying China's territory of Taiwan with military force, and sheltering the Chiang Kai-shek clique's dark rule in Taiwan; the Taiwanese compatriots have been freed from the status of Japanese slaves, only to be pushed into the fiery pit of American slaves. China's territory is being invaded, and China's people are being enslaved. We want to shout: Give us back Taiwan!

    Ten years ago, the news of China recovering Taiwan spread throughout the world. The whole world knew that the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation regarding Taiwan had been implemented. Japan had fulfilled the surrender terms and returned Taiwan to China. This fact, that China had recovered Taiwan, is undeniable. Even the United States cannot deny it. On January 5, 1950, then-President of the United States Harry Truman acknowledged that China was exercising sovereignty over Taiwan. On the same day, then-U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson also said, "When Taiwan was regarded as a province of China, no one had ever raised any legal doubts about it." He believed that China's recovery of Taiwan "was in accordance with all agreements." Thus, there is no international dispute regarding the return of Taiwan to China. China's recovery of Taiwan is completely legal.

    However, on June 27, 1950, five years after China recovered Taiwan, the same U.S. President Harry Truman actually inherited the mantle of the Japanese warlords and announced the dispatch of the U.S. Seventh Fleet to invade the Taiwan Strait. Just as Japan used military force to occupy our Northeast during the "September 18th Incident," the U.S. government used military force to occupy our Taiwan, and has been occupying it until now. This is the root of the international dispute in the Taiwan region today. In order to maintain peace in the Far East and the world, we are willing to eliminate the tense situation in the Taiwan region through direct negotiations between China and the United States. The United States should give up using force against Taiwan and should give up the shameful acts of interfering in China's internal affairs and invading China's territory. The United States should know that as long as the United States does not give up occupying Taiwan, the Chinese people will not relax their struggle to liberate Taiwan for a single day. As long as the United States does not leave Taiwan, the resistance of the Taiwanese people will not stop for a single day. We demand that the United States: Give us back Taiwan!

    Ten years ago, China accepted Japan's surrender in Taiwan and recovered China's territory of Taiwan. This was the result of the victory of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan and the victory of the world's anti-fascist war. This was a legitimate act of implementing the wartime Allied agreements – the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation. It should be pointed out that China's recovery of its own territory of Taiwan was not due to the grace of any country. China exercised the right to recover lost territory in Taiwan as a victorious nation in the war against Japan. This inherent right cannot be denied by anyone. In 1895, Japan seized Taiwan, biting off a piece of flesh from China. From that time on, the Chinese people vowed to settle this account with Japan and were determined to recover Taiwan. The Chinese people, including the Taiwanese people, persisted in decades of anti-Japanese struggle, especially during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. How many rivers and mountains in China were turned into scorched earth, and how much property was turned into ashes; countless heroic sons and daughters of China shed their blood on the battlefield, and the whole country sacrificed more than ten million lives; we paid such a heavy price, and then achieved the final victory of the war, and then restored China's sovereignty over Taiwan. The Chinese people recovered Taiwan from their own blood, so Taiwan of course belongs to the Chinese people, and Taiwan can only be returned to the Chinese people. When the Chinese people have chosen their own form of government and established their own regime – the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China – Taiwan is the Taiwan of the People's Republic of China.

    The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which is unanimously despised by 600 million people, its "National Government" has been overthrown by the Chinese people for six years. The Chinese people will never allow Chiang Kai-shek to steal the fruits of the national people's victory in the War of Resistance, and usurp Taiwan as his own; will never allow the ghost of the "National Government" to occupy a province of China, playing the role of a "China"; will never recognize that Chiang Kai-shek has any right to sign any treaties with foreign countries and sell the territory of Taiwan to the Chinese people. Taiwan is a province of China. If it were not for the United States interfering in China's internal affairs and sheltering the Chiang Kai-shek clique, Taiwan would have been liberated long ago. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which fled to Taiwan to eke out a precarious existence, is by no means a country. Taiwan has never been and will never be a country. All conspiracies to create "two Chinas" are enemies of the Chinese people; all absurd remarks and sinister activities such as "independence," "trusteeship," "neutrality," and "autonomy" aimed at splitting China's territory are resolutely opposed by the Chinese people. Taiwan is a province within the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China. China's sovereignty and territorial integrity must not be undermined. Taiwan must be liberated and must be unified with China. On May 13th of this year, Premier Zhou Enlai said: "There are two possible ways to liberate Taiwan, namely, the way of war and the way of peace. The Chinese people are willing, under possible conditions, to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan." On July 30th, Premier Zhou Enlai also said: "If possible, the Chinese government is willing to consult with the responsible authorities in Taiwan on the specific steps for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan." The Chinese people, including the Taiwanese people, fully support the attitude expressed by Premier Zhou Enlai. Taiwan is the Taiwan of the Chinese people. The Chinese people tell the United States and Chiang Kai-shek: Give us back Taiwan!

    Ten years ago, when the Chinese representatives went to Taiwan to accept the surrender, the Taiwanese compatriots welcomed the representatives and troops sent by the motherland with lofty emotions. They burned with the love for the motherland that had been buried for fifty years. Old people leaned on their crutches, and children carried big flags, and the whole city turned out to welcome the motherland. Millions of eyes contained tears of unspeakable sorrow, and shed tears of meeting long-lost relatives. Fifty years of slave life had bent their waists and carved wrinkles of sorrow on their faces; fifty years of anti-Japanese patriotic struggle history radiated brilliance from their bodies, making them feel the glory and pride of being Chinese. Now, the motherland has come, and the goal of fifty years of struggle has been achieved. When Ando Rikichi signed the surrender in Taipei on this day, when China officially recovered Taiwan, the Taiwanese compatriots burned incense and worshiped their ancestors in every household, comforting their ancestors, saying: Taiwan has returned to China.

    The Taiwanese compatriots are so loyal and love the motherland, and they have infinite hope for Taiwan's return to the motherland. However, reality is cruel. Soon after Chiang Kai-shek took over Taiwan, they saw: Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt officials and bureaucrats running rampant in Taiwan; Taiwan's industry and land were sucked dry by bureaucratic capital; Taiwan's rice, sugar, and other products were transported away in large quantities; Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime was selling Taiwan to the United States, and was driving the Taiwanese people towards unemployment, poverty, and hunger. They realized: Chiang Kai-shek was not the liberator of Taiwan, he was a national thief, he was the great oppressor and great exploiter of Taiwan. They discovered: the people of the whole country hated Chiang Kai-shek, and the compatriots of the motherland, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, were carrying out a heroic war of liberation to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous regime. The Taiwanese compatriots opened their rational eyes and angrily broke out in the "February 28th" uprising; in a few days, they smashed Chiang Kai-shek's ruling apparatus to pieces, and the power of the people almost controlled the entire Taiwan. The "February 28th" uprising proved that the Taiwanese people resolutely opposed Chiang Kai-shek's criminal rule, and at the same time, they also opposed Chiang Kai-shek's backer – American imperialism. Their anti-American and anti-Chiang struggle is still continuing. During the Japanese rule, the Taiwanese people sacrificed 500,000 lives for one wish: to return to the motherland and not be slaves of Japan. Now, under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, the Taiwanese people have once again expressed their will through bloody struggle: they do not want Chiang Kai-shek's rule, and they do not want to be slaves of the United States. They want to return to the motherland, they want liberation, and they want freedom. The words written in blood are indelible. The Taiwanese compatriots and the compatriots of the motherland unanimously demand: Give us back Taiwan!

    China has recovered Taiwan from Japan for ten years. Today, on the tenth anniversary of Taiwan's return to China, we especially miss the Taiwanese compatriots. Today, the police in Taiwan have doubled compared to ten years ago, and the struggle of the Taiwanese compatriots is becoming more and more difficult; today, the exorbitant taxes in Taiwan have increased 52 times compared to six years ago, and the lives of the Taiwanese compatriots are becoming more and more difficult. These also show that Chiang Kai-shek's rule is increasingly shaken, especially recently, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is in a state of panic and is disintegrating, getting closer and closer to its doomsday. At this time, we call on the Taiwanese compatriots to unite! The Taiwanese compatriots have a long-term patriotic tradition, from Koxinga to the present, they have never surrendered to foreign invaders, nor have they ever surrendered to domestic tyranny. The Gaoshan ethnic compatriots are members of the big family of all ethnic groups in China. For thousands of years, they have been fighting to defend their hometown and defend China's Taiwan. Another part of the Chinese people, including Chiang's army officers and soldiers and public education personnel, migrated from various provinces of China after Japan's surrender. They all have their own hometowns and relatives on the mainland. Before the great national righteousness, we believe that they can make patriotic and courageous actions and choose their own bright future. We call on: all Chinese people in Taiwan to continuously improve their patriotic consciousness and fight against American aggression and against Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal and oppression.

    Today, on the occasion of commemorating the tenth anniversary of Taiwan's return to China, we cannot forget the suffering of the Taiwanese compatriots and are determined to liberate Taiwan. We will not give up until we rescue the Taiwanese compatriots from the abyss of suffering and plant the five-star red flag all over Taiwan. The Chinese people's sovereignty over Taiwan is sacred and inviolable, and the determination to liberate Taiwan is forever unshakable. The United States' use of force to occupy Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, attempting to prevent the Chinese people from rescuing their own compatriots and liberating their own territory, is absolutely not allowed by the entire Chinese people, including the Taiwanese people. The Chinese people are working hard to increase their strength to liberate Taiwan. We are moving forward with full confidence on the road to liberating Taiwan. Taiwan must be liberated. 600 million people demand: Give us back Taiwan!

    Give us back Taiwan!

    还我台湾
    ——纪念中国在台湾受降十周年
    台湾民主自治同盟副主席  李纯青
    一九四五年十月二十五日，中国在台湾接受日本台湾总督安藤利吉的投降，当天，中国的代表陈仪便向世界广播：“从今天起，台湾及澎湖列岛正式重入中国版图，所有一切土地、人民、政事皆已置于中国政府主权之下。”从这一天起，台湾便已归还中国了。
    十年前，台湾已经归还了中国。而现在，美国正以武力强占着中国的领土台湾，庇护着蒋介石集团在台湾的黑暗统治；台湾同胞从日本奴隶的地位解脱出来，又被推到美国奴隶的火坑中去。中国的国土被侵占，中国的人民被奴役。我们要高呼：还我台湾！
    十年前，中国收复台湾的消息曾经传遍世界，全世界知道：开罗宣言和波茨坦公告关于台湾的规定已经实施了。日本已经履行了投降条款，将台湾归还中国了。这个事实，即中国已经收复台湾的事实，是没有人能够否认的。就是美国也不能否认。一九五○年一月五日，当时美国总统杜鲁门承认：中国已经在台湾行使主权。同日，当时美国国务卿艾奇逊也说：“当台湾被作为中国的一个省份的时候，没有任何人曾对此提出过任何法律上的疑难。”他认为中国收复台湾“是符合各项约定的”。由此可见，台湾归还中国并不存在任何国际纠纷问题。中国收复台湾是完全合法的。
    但是，到了一九五○年六月二十七日，在中国收复台湾以后的第五年，同一个美国总统杜鲁门，竟然继承日本军阀的衣钵，宣布派遣美国第七舰队侵入台湾海峡，像“九一八”事变时日本使用武力侵占我国的东北一样，美国政府使用武力侵占了我国的台湾，一直侵占到现在。这就是今天台湾地区国际纠纷的根源。为了维护远东和世界和平，我们愿意通过中美两国的直接谈判，来消除台湾地区的紧张局势。美国应该放弃对台湾使用武力，应该放弃干涉中国内政、侵占中国领土的可耻行为。美国应该知道，美国一天不放弃侵占台湾，中国人民就一天也不放松解放台湾的斗争。美国一天不离开台湾，台湾人民的反抗就一天也不会停止。我们要求美国：还我台湾！
    十年前，中国在台湾接受日本的投降，收复了中国的领土台湾。这是中国人民抗日战争胜利和世界人民反法西斯战争胜利的结果。这是执行战时盟国的协议——开罗宣言和波茨坦公告的合法行为。应该指出，中国收复自己的领土台湾并不是出于那个国家的恩赐，中国是以对日战争战胜国的资格，在台湾行使收复失土的权利。这种当然的权利，是任何人都不能抹煞的。一八九五年日本抢去台湾，是从中国身上咬掉一块肉。从那时候起，中国人立誓要和日本清算这笔账，一定要收复台湾。中国人民包括台湾人民坚持了数十年的抗日斗争，特别是在八年的全面抗日战争中，中国多少河山化为焦土，多少财产化为灰烬；中国无数英雄儿女在战场上抛头颅，洒热血，全国牺牲了一千万以上的生命；我们付出的代价是如此沉重，然后取得了战争的最后胜利，然后恢复中国在台湾的主权。中国人民是从自己流出的血泊中收复台湾的，台湾当然属于中国人民，台湾只能归还给中国人民。当中国人民已经选择了自己的政府形式，建立起自己的政权——中华人民共和国中央人民政府的时候，台湾就是中华人民共和国的台湾了。
    为六亿人民所一致唾弃的蒋介石卖国集团，它的“国民政府”已被中国人民推翻六年了。中国人民绝不容许蒋介石盗取全国人民抗战胜利的果实，窃踞台湾为己有；绝不容许“国民政府”的亡魂盘据中国的一省，扮演为一个“中国”；绝不承认蒋介石有任何权利可以和外国签订任何条约，出卖中国人民的领土台湾。台湾是中国的一个行省，如果不是美国干涉中国内政，庇护蒋介石集团，台湾早已解放。逃到台湾苟延残喘的蒋介石卖国集团，它绝不是一个什么国家。台湾也从来不是而且永远不会是一个国家。一切制造“两个中国”的阴谋都是与中国人民为敌；一切以分裂中国领土为目的的“独立”、“托管”、“中立”、“自治”等荒谬言论和阴险活动，都为中国人民所坚决反对。台湾是在中华人民共和国主权之内的一个省份，中国的主权和领土完整绝不容破坏，台湾一定要解放，一定要统一到中国来。今年五月十三日周恩来总理说过：“解放台湾有两种可能的方式，即战争的方式和和平的方式，中国人民愿意在可能的条件下，争取用和平的方式解放台湾。”七月三十日，周恩来总理又说：“如果可能的话，中国政府愿意同台湾地方的负责当局协商和平解放台湾的具体步骤。”中国人民包括台湾人民，完全拥护周恩来总理所表示的态度。台湾是中国人民的台湾，中国人民告诉美国和蒋介石：还我台湾！
    十年前，在中国代表到台湾受降的时候，台湾同胞以崇高的感情，迎接祖国派来的代表和军队。他们燃烧着埋藏五十年的祖国爱，老人扶着拐杖，小孩子扛起大旗，万人空巷来欢迎祖国。千万对眼睛含着说不尽的辛酸泪，流出了会见久别亲人的热泪。五十年的奴隶生活，压弯了他们的腰，在他们脸上刻下了愁苦的皱纹；五十年的抗日爱国斗争历史，在他们的身上发出光辉，使他们感到作为中国人的光荣和骄傲。现在，祖国来了，五十年斗争的目的达到了。当安藤利吉在台北签字投降这一天，在中国正式收复台湾的时候，台湾同胞家家户户焚香祭祖，告慰自己的祖先，说：台湾回到中国了。
    台湾同胞对祖国是这样地忠贞和热爱，对回到祖国的台湾更是抱着无限的希望。但是，现实是残酷的。在蒋介石接收台湾之后不久，他们就看见了：蒋介石的贪官污吏横行台湾；台湾的产业和土地被官僚资本一口吸干；台湾的米、糖及其他物产大量被运走；蒋介石的反动政权正在出卖台湾给美国，正在把台湾人驱向失业、贫困和饥饿。他们认识了：原来蒋介石并不是台湾的解放者，他是一个窃国大盗，他是台湾的大压迫者和大剥削者。他们发现了：全国人民都在痛恨蒋介石，祖国同胞在中国共产党领导下，正在为推翻蒋介石卖国政权而进行英勇的解放战争。台湾同胞张开了理性的眼睛，愤怒地爆发了“二二八”起义；没有几天，就把蒋介石的统治机构打得稀烂，人民的力量差不多控制了整个台湾。“二二八”起义证明了，台湾人民坚决反对蒋介石的罪恶统治，同时，也反对蒋介石的靠山——美国帝国主义。他们的反美反蒋斗争现在还在继续中。在日本统治时代，台湾人民付出了五十万的生命，为了一个愿望：要求回归祖国，不做日本的奴隶。现在台湾人民在蒋介石统治之下，他们又以流血斗争表明自己的意志：不要蒋介石的统治，不做美国的奴隶。他们要回祖国，要解放，要自由。用鲜血写出的字句是不可磨灭的。台湾同胞和祖国同胞一致要求：还我台湾！
    中国从日本手中收复台湾已经十年了。今天，在台湾归还中国十周年的时候，我们格外怀念着台湾同胞。今天台湾的警察比十年前已增加一倍，台湾同胞的斗争越来越艰苦了；今天台湾的苛捐杂税比六年前增加五十二倍，台湾同胞的生活越来越困难了。这些也说明着：蒋介石的统治已日益动摇，特别是最近，蒋介石集团惶惶不可终日，正在分崩离析中，更加接近它的末日了。这时候，我们号召台湾同胞团结起来！台湾同胞有长期的爱国传统，从郑成功起到现在，从来不向外国侵略者屈服，也从来不向国内的暴政屈服。高山族同胞，是中国各民族大家庭中的一员，他们千百年来都在为保卫自己的家乡、保卫祖国的台湾而战斗。另一部分中国人，包括蒋军官兵和公教人员，是在日本投降以后从中国各省迁移过去的，他们在大陆都有自己的家乡和亲人，在民族大义之前，我们相信他们能够作出爱国的勇敢的行动，选择自己的光明的前途。我们号召：所有在台湾的中国人，都要不断地提高爱国觉悟，为反对美国侵略、反对蒋介石的卖国和压迫而奋斗。
    今天，在纪念台湾归还中国十周年的时候，我们不能忘记台湾同胞的苦难，决心要解放台湾。不把台湾同胞从水深火热中拯救出来，不把五星红旗插遍台湾，誓不罢休。中国人民对于台湾的主权是神圣不可侵犯的，解放台湾的决心是永远不可动摇的。美国使用武力侵占台湾和台湾海峡，企图阻止中国人民拯救自己的同胞，解放自己的领土，全中国人民包括台湾人民是绝不允许的。中国人民正在为增加解放台湾的力量努力工作。我们满怀信心地在解放台湾的道路上前进。台湾是一定要解放的。六万万人要求：还我台湾！
    还我台湾！
