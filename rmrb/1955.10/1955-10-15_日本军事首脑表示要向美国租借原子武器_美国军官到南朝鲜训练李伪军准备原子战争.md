Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese "Defense Agency" Director General Shigemasa Sunada publicly told reporters in Hokkaido on the 12th that the "Defense Agency" plans to formally request the United States to lease atomic rocket launchers to Japan for research and experimentation by the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces."

According to the Associated Press, the day after Sunada made this statement (October 13th), authoritative sources in the U.S. Department of Defense said that if Japan wants to train personnel to master atomic rocket launchers, the United States is not prepared to rule out supplying Japan with such weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, October 13th: Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese "Defense Agency" has recently drafted a plan to establish a "Tondenhei" (military settlements) system in Hokkaido. According to this plan, the "Defense Agency" will try to keep approximately 10,000 "Self-Defense Force" members stationed in Hokkaido who are scheduled to retire next year and the year after, in Hokkaido to form "Tondenhei," in order to expand the reserve forces of the Japanese army and allow these people to participate in the military construction of Hokkaido.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 14th: Seoul Dispatch: The U.S. Eighth Army announced on the 13th that an American instructor group has arrived in South Korea "to teach a select group of Korean Army officers how to survive in the event of atomic warfare."

    日本军事首脑表示要向美国租借原子武器
    美国军官到南朝鲜训练李伪军准备原子战争
    新华社十四日讯　东京消息：日本“防卫厅”长官砂田重政十二日在北海道公开向记者说，“防卫厅”打算正式要求美国租借原子火箭发射器给日本，以供日本“自卫队”进行研究和试验之用。
    据美联社报道，在砂田发表这个谈话的第二天（十三日），美国国防部的权威人士说，如果日本要训练掌握原子火箭发射器的人员的话，美国不准备把供给日本以这种武器一事排斥于计划之外。
    新华社十三日讯　东京消息：日本“防卫厅”最近已经拟订了一项在北海道建立“屯田兵”制度的草案。根据这个草案，“防卫厅”要尽量把驻在北海道的明年和后年退伍的约一万名“自卫队”队员都留居在北海道，组成“屯田兵”，以扩充日本军队的后备兵力，并且让这些人参加北海道的军事建设。
    新华社平壤十四日电　汉城消息：美国第八军十三日宣布，一个美国教官组已经到达南朝鲜，“以教授一批精选的韩国陆军军官如何在原子战争情况下保存生命的方法”。公告又说，“这些韩国陆军军官将在受训完毕后教授其他韩国陆军人员”。据合众社透露，美国教官组是由驻日本的第八军化学作战部门的专家们组成的。
    这种活动是美国训练南朝鲜军队准备原子战争的计划的一部分。南朝鲜报纸不久前即已透露，美国原子作战专家将到南朝鲜训练李伪军如何使用核子武器。
