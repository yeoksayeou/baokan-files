The "German Democratic Republic Prints and Sculptures Exhibition" has been attracting many visitors since it opened on October 7th in Zhongshan Park, Beijing. There is great interest in the exhibited works, especially the prints with their long-standing and excellent tradition.

　　The exhibition is rich in content and diverse in form. The one hundred and thirty-odd works, including those by more than sixty artists, are mostly prints, apart from a dozen or so sculptures. There are lithographs, etchings, monochrome and color woodcuts, as well as posters, cartoons, and pen and ink drawings, pencil drawings, charcoal drawings, brush drawings, watercolors, and ink paintings. The works reflect the German people's struggle, labor, and life, and also express the common desire of the world's people for lasting peace. In addition, many works depict portraits, adorable animals, and beautiful scenery. Each work is full of rich German national characteristics, and each artist has his or her own style.

    The exhibition also includes several famous prints by world-renowned German art masters Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) and Käthe Kollwitz (1867-1945).
