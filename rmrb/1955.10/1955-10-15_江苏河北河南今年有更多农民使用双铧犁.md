Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch: This year, more farmers in Jiangsu, Hebei, and Henan provinces are using double-wheel double-share plows for autumn plowing and wheat planting.

More than 10,100 double-wheel double-share plows in Jiangsu Province have been put into autumn production. The province originally planned to promote 14,000 double-wheel double-share plows this year, but currently, farmers in only 41 counties, including Tongshan, Sihong, Xuyi, Huaiyin, Changshu, and Wuxian, have already bought and ordered more than 15,500. The supply and marketing cooperative in the Cangxian Special District of Hebei Province sold 500 more double-wheel double-share plows in September than it did from February to August. Farmers in the Zhangjiakou Special District have used more than 2,800 double-wheel double-share plows to plow more than 373,000 mu of land in autumn plowing, which is one or two inches deeper than plowing with old plows. This special district now has an average of one double-wheel double-share plow per agricultural production cooperative. The number of double-wheel double-share plows sold in Henan Province in September was more than 54% higher than the total sales from January to June. The sales of double-wheel double-share plows in Wuzhi and two other counties in the Xinxiang Special District have exceeded the annual supply plan.

While promoting double-wheel double-share plows, supply and marketing cooperatives and relevant departments in various places have taught farmers the technology of using, installing, and repairing double-share plows. Hebei Province has trained more than 39,000 agricultural tool technicians by holding training classes, various meetings, and organizing visits and performances. The Ningjin County Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau and other departments jointly established a "Double-Wheel Double-Share Plow Technology Consultation Office" to be responsible for teaching technology to farmers. Supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural technology guidance stations in Huaiyang, Fengqiu, Anyang, Tangyin and other places in Henan Province have trained technicians to use double-wheel double-share plows for local agricultural production cooperatives.

    江苏河北河南今年有更多农民使用双铧犁
    新华社十四日讯　江苏、河北、河南三省今年有更多的农民，使用双轮双铧犁进行秋耕和种麦。
    江苏省已有一万零一百多部双轮双铧犁投入了秋季生产。这个省今年原来只计划推广双轮双铧犁一万四千部，但目前仅铜山、泗洪、盱眙、淮阴、常熟、吴县等四十一个县的农民，已买去和订购的就有一万五千五百多部。河北省沧县专区供销合作社九月份推销的双轮双铧犁，比二月到八月的推销数量还多五百多部。张家口专区的农民在秋耕中，已用二千八百多部双轮双铧犁耕了三十七万三千多亩地，都比旧犁深耕一、二寸。这个专区现在平均每个农业生产合作社都有一部双轮双铧犁。河南全省九月份销售的双轮双铧犁，比一月到六月的销售总数还多百分之五十四以上。新乡专区武陟等三县销售的双轮双铧犁已经超过全年的供应计划。
    各地供销合作社和有关部门在推广双轮双铧犁的同时，向农民传授了双铧犁的使用、安装和修理的技术。河北省采取办训练班、举行各种会议和组织参观、表演等办法，训练了农具手三万九千多人。宁津县供销合作社和农林局等部门联合成立了“双轮双铧犁技术问事处”，负责向农民传授技术。河南省淮阳、封邱、安阳、汤阴等地的供销合作社和农业技术指导站给当地的农业生产合作社训练了使用双轮双铧犁的技术员。
