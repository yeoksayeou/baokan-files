The Chinese edition of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau's organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" 1955, Issue 39, has been published.

This issue features an editorial titled "The Historic Achievements of the Great Chinese People," celebrating the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The editorial states that in the past six years, the whole world has seen the great vitality and power of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have united the Chinese people into a huge and invincible force. The Chinese Communist Party has embarked on the socialist industrialization of the country, prioritizing the development of heavy industries, and is gradually carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, thereby inspiring the broad masses of working people to strive for a new socialist society. Now, the Chinese people are enthusiastically implementing the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. The progressive impact of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the construction of a new life on the fate of the people of Asian countries is indeed inestimable. Similarly, the role of the People's Republic of China in resolving all current international problems and its special importance in the struggle for peace in Asia and the world are also inestimable. The editorial, in mentioning the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and the Taiwan issue, points out that the truth is on the side of the freedom-loving Chinese people. No one can stop the logical development of history.

This issue contains the talks between Bulganin, Khrushchev and members of the Japanese Diet delegation visiting the Soviet Union in September. Important articles in this issue include World Federation of Trade Unions President Victorio's "The Tenth Anniversary of the World Federation of Trade Unions," Chinese "People's Daily" Editor-in-Chief Deng Tuo's "The Chinese People Advance on the Socialist Road," and Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee Political Bureau Member Barak's "Improving the Work of State Organs," among others.

Victorio's article states that the establishment of the World Federation of Trade Unions on October 3, 1945, was a major event in the history of the international trade union movement. For the first time, trade unions from the Soviet Union and people's democracies, as well as trade unions from all capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries, were united in the same trade union organization. The first ten years after its establishment have proved that its unified program fully meets the new objective requirements of the working class, and its multifaceted and systematic work meets the most important tasks facing the working people in the new historical period after defeating fascism. As the World Federation of Trade Unions commemorates its tenth anniversary, it reiterates its intention to seize every opportunity to promote the broadest trade union unity and develop the concerted action of the working people of all countries and the world.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五五年第三十九期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第三十九期中文版已经出版。
    这一期以“伟大的中国人民的历史性成就”为题发表社论，庆祝中华人民共和国成立六周年。社论说，在过去的六年中，全世界都看到了中华人民共和国的伟大生命力和威力。中国共产党和人民政府已经使中国人民团结成一股巨大的、不可战胜的力量。中国共产党已经着手实现优先发展重工业的国家的社会主义工业化，逐步对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造，从而鼓舞了广大劳动人民为社会主义新社会而奋斗。现在，中国人民正在热情地执行发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。中国人民革命的胜利和新生活的建设对于亚洲各国人民的命运所产生的进步影响确实是难以估计的。同样，中华人民共和国在解决当前一切国际问题方面所起的作用和在争取亚洲及全世界和平的斗争中的特殊重要性，也是难以估计的。社论在提到恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利和台湾问题时指出：真理是在爱好自由的中国人民一方面的。任何人都不能阻止历史的逻辑的发展。
    这一期刊载了布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫九月间同日本国会议员访苏团人员的谈话。这一期刊载的重要文章有世界工会联合会主席维多里奥的“世界工会联合会成立十周年”，中国“人民日报”总编辑邓拓的“中国人民在社会主义道路上前进”和捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会政治局委员巴拉克的“改进国家机关的工作”等。
    维多里奥的文章说，一九四五年十月三日世界工会联合会的成立，是国际工会运动历史上的一件大事。苏联和人民民主国家的工会以及所有资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国的工会，第一次团结在同一个工会组织里。它成立后的头十年证明，它的统一纲领完全符合工人阶级的新的客观要求，它的多方面的、有系统的工作，符合劳动人民在击溃法西斯后的新历史时期所面临的最重要的任务。世界工会联合会在纪念自己的十周年的时候，要再度表示它将利用一切机会来促成最广泛的工会大团结，发展各国和全世界劳动人民的一致行动。
