Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: The Chiang bandit's Ministry of Education and book censorship organs have designated thousands of books as "banned books," which are being sealed up and burned in Taiwan.

According to the "Yearbook" published by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the books banned by the Chiang bandits include books published by the Commercial Press before liberation, such as Steam Tables and Mollier Diagrams, Theoretical Chemistry Experiments, Inorganic Chemistry General Theory, General Physics, Fertilizer Science, Rice Cultivation, Rice Pest Science, and Practical Leather Making.

Taiwanese newspapers revealed that the Chiang bandits stipulated that all publications by authors, editors, or translators residing in mainland China would be classified as "banned books." The news said that most publications in our country, including Ci Yuan and Ci Hai, have been banned by the Chiang bandits in Taiwan.

The news also said that, on the other hand, publications of the Chiang bandit's military police secret service and tax authorities are flooding Taiwan, and Chiang bandit personnel are forcibly promoting them to the Taiwanese people. There are many kinds of magazines published by the Chiang bandit police secret service organs alone, such as Baojing Semimonthly, Police Magazine, Intelligence Monthly, Police-Civilian Herald, Police Friend Magazine, Detective Magazine, etc. These Chiang bandit magazines promote and publicize the so-called "security defense literature" of secret service terror. Recently, the Chiang bandit's "Taxation" fortnightly has also clamored to establish so-called "taxation literature and art."

Under the Chiang bandit's intensified criminal measures to destroy culture, Taiwanese newspapers said that in Taiwan, "it is really not easy to find a few decent books to read now."

    蒋贼在台湾查禁大批书籍
    新华社二十九日讯　蒋贼教育部和图书审查机关把成千上万种书籍列为“禁书”，在台湾加以查封烧毁。
    据蒋介石卖国集团的“年鉴”发表，在蒋贼查禁的书籍中，包括商务印书馆在解放前出版的蒸气表与莫理尔图、理论化学实验、无机化学通论、普通物理学、肥料学、稻作学、稻作虫害学、实用制革学等书在内。
    台湾报纸透露，蒋贼规定凡是住在中国大陆的作者、编者或译者的出版物一律列为“禁书”。消息中说，我国绝大部分出版物，包括辞源、辞海在内，在台湾都被蒋贼查禁。
    消息又说，另一方面，蒋贼军警特务和税务机关的出版物在台湾充斥，蒋贼人员强向台湾人民推销。单是蒋贼警察特务机关出版的杂志，就有保警半月刊、警察杂志、情报月刊、警民导报、警察之友杂志、侦探杂志等许多种。这些蒋贼杂志提倡宣扬特务恐怖的所谓“保防文学”。最近蒋贼“税务”旬刊又吵嚷着要建立所谓“税务文艺”。
    在蒋贼变本加厉摧残文化的罪恶措施下，台湾报纸说，在台湾“现在想要找几本像样的书来读，真不是一件容易的事”。
