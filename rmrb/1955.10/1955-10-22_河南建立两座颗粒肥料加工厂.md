Henan Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative has decided to build two new granular fertilizer processing plants in Kaifeng and Xuchang. Currently, the sites for both plants have been selected, and the construction of factory sheds, urine storage pools, drying kilns, and warehouses is about to begin.

These two plants will both use urban garbage, human excrement, human urine, and a certain proportion of chemical fertilizers mixed together to produce granular fertilizer. The advantages of this fertilizer are: it is not easily pulverized when the weather is dry, and it does not easily clump when it is humid. It is convenient for packaging, transporting to various parts of the province and the country to supply the needs of rural production. Both plants are planned to be put into production in January next year.

    河南建立两座颗粒肥料加工厂
    河南省供销合作社决定在开封、许昌两市新建两座颗粒肥料加工厂。目前两厂厂址已经选定，厂棚、蓄尿池、烘炕和仓库等工程就要开工。
    这两个厂都是利用城市内的垃圾、人屎、人尿和一定比例的化学肥料混合制成颗粒肥料。这种肥料的优点是：在天气干燥时不易粉碎，潮湿时不易结块。便于包装、运往全省及全国各地供应农村生产的需要。两厂都计划在明年一月份投入生产。
