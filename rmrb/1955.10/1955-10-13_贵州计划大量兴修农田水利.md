Guizhou Province plans to build a large number of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects and expand the irrigated area by 1.6 million mu. Among them, 9,600 weirs and reservoirs will be built, which are estimated to irrigate 960,000 mu of farmland after completion, accounting for 60% of the total plan. At present, key water conservancy projects in many counties have begun construction. All water conservancy projects are required to be completed before January 15, 1956. In order to strengthen the leadership of this work, governments at all levels have not only designated special personnel to be responsible for it, but also plan to train 14,800 farmer water conservancy technicians and counselors.

    贵州计划大量兴修农田水利
    贵州省计划大量兴修小型农田水利，扩大灌溉面积一百六十万亩。其中兴修堰塘、水库九千六百口，完工后估计可灌田九十六万亩，占全部计划的百分之六十。目前不少县的重点水利工程已开始动工。全部水利工程要求在一九五六年一月十五日以前竣工。为加强这一工作的领导，各级政府除指定专人负责外，并计划训练一万四千八百名农民水利技术员和辅导员。　　　　（王治平）
