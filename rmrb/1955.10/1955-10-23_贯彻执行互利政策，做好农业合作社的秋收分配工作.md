Implement a Mutually Beneficial Policy and Do a Good Job in the Autumn Harvest Distribution of Agricultural Cooperatives
By our reporter Gu Weijin

This year, Hubei Province had a bumper harvest. The more than 14,000 agricultural cooperatives established before spring carried out the autumn harvest distribution work on the basis of the bumper harvest. According to statistics from 14,238 cooperatives, 12,476 cooperatives increased production, accounting for 87.62 percent of the total number of cooperatives surveyed. 929 cooperatives maintained production, accounting for 6.5 percent of the total number of cooperatives surveyed (if late autumn crops grow well, most cooperatives can still increase production); 833 cooperatives reduced production, accounting for 5.8 percent of the total number of cooperatives surveyed. All agricultural cooperatives that increased production can guarantee that about 95 percent of their members will increase their income (individual members whose income does not increase or decrease, or who experience a decrease in production, also receive reasonable benefits and necessary care). According to statistics from 91,241 households of members in 4,511 cooperatives that increased production, 86,536 households increased their income, accounting for 94.85 percent of the total number of member households surveyed.

The reason why agricultural cooperatives that increased production this year can ensure that the vast majority of their members increase their income is inseparable from the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China's conscientious implementation of the mutually beneficial policy in the distribution work.

Last winter and this spring, in the process of establishing and rectifying cooperatives in various places, due to the short time and rough work, the mutually beneficial policy was not well implemented, which was manifested in the generally low assessment of land yields (generally 10 to 15 percent lower than the normal actual yield), the high assessment of land yields in individual cooperatives, the unreasonable ratio of remuneration for land and labor, and the low remuneration for livestock and large farm implements. In addition, there were also problems with weak accounting work and chaotic financial work. If these problems are not resolved, it will be difficult to ensure that members receive fair and reasonable benefits. In order to do a good job in the distribution work, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China first studied the party's distribution principles and various relevant policies, summarized the pilot experience of distribution work, and formulated the "Several Specific Policy Regulations on Handling Economic Issues within Agricultural Cooperatives" as the basis for adjusting the relevant unreasonable distribution parts in various places. Secondly, a large number of cadres were transferred to conduct short-term training on the correct implementation of distribution policies and sent to various places to assist in the distribution work. A total of about 10,000 staff members and leading backbone members within the cooperatives were transferred and trained by the Provincial Party Committee and Party committees at all levels.

Due to the strengthening of the leadership of the distribution work by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, all localities conscientiously implemented the mutually beneficial policy in the distribution work, so that the vast majority of members received reasonable benefits. For example, the land yield assessment of more than 100 cooperatives in Huanggang County was originally 10 to 30 percent lower than the normal actual yield, so many members had to reduce their income. The staff assisted these cooperatives in reasonably adjusting the yield and then reasonably adjusted the distribution ratio of land and labor on the basis of the adjusted yield. As a result, more than 95 percent of the members increased their income compared to before joining the cooperative. The first Xudong Agricultural Cooperative in Lukou Township, Echeng County, originally had a land yield assessment that was 21 percent lower than the normal actual yield, and the land-labor remuneration ratio was unreasonable. Therefore, three types of people in the entire cooperative had to reduce their income: first, middle peasants with more land and less labor; second, poor peasants with large families and little labor; and third, widowed and impoverished households lacking labor. After the staff assisted this cooperative in adjusting the land yield assessment and the land-labor remuneration ratio, the first type of people increased their income by an average of 200 jin of grain, with the most reaching 400 jin; the second type of people increased their income by an average of 100 to 200 jin of grain; and the average income of the third type of people also increased. The members happily said: The Communist Party's policy is really good! It really benefits everyone.

The result of conscientiously implementing the mutually beneficial policy in the autumn harvest distribution has played a significant role in consolidating agricultural cooperatives. Before the distribution, many members were very dissatisfied because they saw that the cooperative had not implemented the mutually beneficial policy well. Some people were passive and uneasy, some wanted to withdraw from the cooperative, and a few people withdrew from the cooperative. Now they see that the agricultural cooperative has reasonably distributed the benefits and that the vast majority of members have increased their income, and their morale has increased. For example, Zhu Qimin, a member of the fifth agricultural cooperative in Wangci Township, Xishui County, originally said to people in private due to unfair yield assessment: "I joined the cooperative with a heavy heart, forced by the situation." He did not speak at meetings, did not work hard, and opposed the accumulation of public funds. People in the cooperative always criticized him for being backward. After his yield was reasonably adjusted, he was very happy, worked before dawn and slept late at night, actively spoke at meetings, and promoted the superiority of collectivization with a smile all day long. Zhong Mingyu, a member of the second Baiyang Cooperative in Yangxin County, had always wanted to withdraw from the cooperative for a year due to concerns about not being able to increase his income. Now, after reasonable distribution, he has increased his income by more than 1,500 jin of grain, and he firmly said: "The new road has a really big future, I will never withdraw from the cooperative even if I die." Zheng Qinglin, a member of the Democratic Agricultural Cooperative in Zhupeisi Township, Huanggang County, saw that the yield assessment in the cooperative was unfair before the spring and withdrew from the cooperative in the spring. Now he sees that the cooperative has adjusted the yield and implemented reasonable distribution, and the income of each member household has increased. He is very regretful and has asked to return to the cooperative.

The result of implementing the mutually beneficial policy in the autumn harvest distribution has also played a significant role in the development of agricultural cooperatives. Before the distribution, many mutual aid teams and individual farmers felt that agricultural cooperatives were not reasonable enough in dealing with land yield assessment and other issues. Although they saw that the crops in the cooperatives were growing very well, they still adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards joining the cooperatives. Some people said: Whether to build or not depends on the autumn harvest (depends on the distribution of cooperatives after the autumn harvest). Now that they have seen the fact that agricultural cooperatives can ensure that the vast majority of members increase their income, many people have actively asked to join agricultural cooperatives. In Xiaogan County, there are more than 300 agricultural cooperatives, and each cooperative has an average of more than 12 farmers asking to join. Most of the more than 400 permanent mutual aid teams in the Huanggang Special Area are preparing to transfer to cooperatives. When Chen De Township, Shangbahe District, Huanggang County, established an agricultural cooperative last year, Zhou Huanshan, an individual farmer, firmly refused to join the cooperative. Now he is actively applying to join the cooperative. The masses in many areas have also expressed their determination to participate in agricultural cooperatives by automatically handing in public grain in advance and selling surplus grain in practical actions.

The reasonable autumn harvest distribution of agricultural cooperatives in Hubei Province is pushing the collectivization movement to a climax.

    贯彻执行互利政策，做好农业合作社的秋收分配工作
    本报记者　古维进
    今年湖北省的庄稼丰收，全省春前建立的一万四千多个农业合作社在丰收的基础上进行了秋收分配工作。据统计一万四千二百三十八个社，增产社有一万二千四百七十六个，占统计总社数的百分之八十七点六二，保产社有九百二十九个，占统计总社数的百分之六点五（如晚秋作物生长得好，多数社还能增产）；减产社有八百三十三个，占统计总社数的百分之五点八。凡增产的农业合作社，绝大多数都能保证百分之九十五左右的社员增加收入（个别不增不减或减产的社员，也大都得到合理收益和必要照顾）。据四千五百一十一个增产社的九万一千二百四十一户社员统计，增加收入的有八万六千五百三十六户，占统计总社员户数的百分之九十四点八五。
    今年增产的农业合作社能保证绝大多数社员增加收入，是同中共湖北省委在分配工作中认真贯彻执行互利政策分不开的。
    去冬今春，各地在建社和整顿社的过程中，由于时间短，工作粗糙，没有很好贯彻执行互利政策，表现在土地评产普遍偏低（一般低于常年实产量百分之十到百分之十五），个别的社土地评产偏高，土地和劳力的报酬比例不合理，牲口、大农具报酬偏低。此外，还有会计工作薄弱和财务工作混乱的问题。这些问题如果得不到解决，就很难保证社员得到公平合理的收益。为了做好分配工作，中共湖北省委首先研究了党的分配原则和各项有关政策，总结了分配工作的试点经验，制定了“关于处理农业合作社内经济问题的几个具体政策的规定”，作为各地调整有关不合理分配部分的依据。其次，又抽调大批干部，进行关于正确执行分配政策的短期训练，派往各地协助进行分配工作。计省委和各级党委调训的工作人员和社内领导骨干共约一万人。
    由于中共湖北省委加强对分配工作的领导，各地在分配工作中都认真执行了互利政策，使绝大多数社员得到了合理的收益。例如黄冈县原来有一百多个合作社的土地入社评产低于常年实产量百分之十到百分之三十，许多社员因此要减少收入；工作人员协助这些社合理调整了产量，又在调整了产量的基础上合理调整了土地和劳力的分配比例，结果，有百分之九十五以上的社员都比入社以前增加了收入。鄂城县路口乡旭东第一农业合作社，原来的土地入社评产比常年实际产量低百分之二十一，地、劳报酬比例不合理，因此全社有三种人要减少收入：一是土地多劳力少的中农；二是家口大劳力少的贫农；三是缺乏劳力的孤寡困难户。工作人员协助这个社调整了土地评产和地、劳报酬比例后，第一种人平均增加收入粮食二百斤，最多的达四百斤；第二种人平均增加收入粮食一百斤至二百斤；第三种人平均收入也有增加。社员们高兴地说：共产党的政策真好呀！真是做到人人有利。
    在秋收分配中认真执行互利政策的结果，对巩固农业合作社起了很大作用。分配以前，许多社员因为看见社里没有很好执行互利政策，很不满意。有的人表现消极，情绪不安，有的人想退社，个别的人退了社。现在他们看见农业合作社合理分配了收益，绝大多数社员增加了收入，情绪高起来了。例如，浠水县王祠乡第五农业合作社社员朱启民，原来因评产不公，背地对人说：“我这是狠心入社，时势逼迫。”他开会不发言，干活不起劲，反对积累公共基金；社里人总是批评他落后。对他的产量加以合理调整以后，他很高兴，干活起五更睡半夜，开会积极发言，整天喜笑颜开地宣传合作化的优越性。阳新县白杨二社社员钟明玉曾因顾虑不能增加收入，一年来总是闹退社。现在经过合理分配，增加收入粮食一千五百多斤，他坚决地说：“新道路奔头真大呀，死也不退社了。”黄冈县竹陂寺乡民主农业合作社社员郑庆林，春前看见社里评产不公平，春季退了社，现在看见社里调整产量，实行合理分配，每户社员收入都增加了，他非常后悔，又要求回到社里。
    秋收分配中贯彻执行互利政策的结果，对发展农业合作社也起了很大作用。分配以前，许多互助组和单干农民觉得农业合作社在处理土地评产等问题上不够合理，虽然看到社的庄稼长得很好，但对入社还是采取观望态度，有的人这样说：建不建，看秋收（看秋收后合作社的分配）。现在看到农业合作社能保证绝大多数社员增加收入的事实，许多人已积极要求参加农业合作社。在孝感县，三百多个农业合作社里，每个社平均有十二个多农民要求入社。黄冈专区四百多个常年互助组，绝大部分在筹备转社。黄冈县上巴河区陈德乡去年建立农业合作社时，单干农民周涣山坚决不愿入社，现在他积极申请入社。不少地区的群众还用自动提前交公粮，卖余粮的实际行动，表示参加农业合作社的决心。
    湖北省农业合作社的合理进行秋收分配，正在把合作化运动推向高潮。
