    Kashgar, an ancient city of the Uyghur people, with a history of two thousand years, is located in the ring of oases on the western edge of the Tarim Desert in Xinjiang. For a long time, it has been the political, economic, and cultural center of southern Xinjiang. The former Southern Xinjiang Administrative Office of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government was located here. The city has a population of nearly 50,000 residents of thirteen ethnic groups, including Uyghur, Han, Hui, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Russian, Tajik, and Tatar.

    Today, the ancient city's appearance has become exceptionally young and beautiful. Three years ago, the suburbs were a barren wasteland; now, silver-gray buildings stand tall, including government offices, hospitals, factories, and schools. Many new buildings are also under construction. A People's Park, covering more than 500 mu, has been built in the southern part of the city. The park features a People's Cultural Palace and an open-air theater with strong ethnic characteristics, and is planted with flowers, plants, and trees. It is the most beloved recreation place for people of all ethnic groups. The approximately one-kilometer-long road from the central bazaar to the southern suburbs has been completed, with a flat surface wide enough for three cars to travel side by side. Houses are being built along both sides of the road, and in a year or two, it will be a bustling street.

    Since the Tang and Song dynasties, Kashgar's commercial trade has never been as prosperous as it is now. The North Avenue and Grand Bazaar areas are the concentrated commercial districts, with sixteen state-owned trading companies, department stores, specialized companies, and cooperative branches, as well as 2,600 private shops. People of all ethnic groups can freely buy their favorite daily necessities from all over the country, such as silk, satin, wool, rubber boots, tea, and sugar. State-owned cooperative and trade organizations also purchase large quantities of nationally famous Hotan carpets, silk, jade, and the hides, wool, and casings produced in the Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Prefecture, as well as dried fruits and other local products from various parts of southern Xinjiang.

    Kashgar is a city with a fairly developed handicraft industry. Twenty-four percent of the city's population is engaged in handicrafts such as fuel, metal, construction, ceramics, wood, textiles, sewing, and leather. The exquisite Uyghur embroidered caps produced here are famous throughout the country. Before liberation, most of the handicraftsmen were on the verge of bankruptcy. After liberation, with the strong support of the state-owned economy, handicraft production has been restored and developed. After the announcement of the general task of the state during the transition period, handicraftsmen have asked to organize and take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. Now, five production cooperatives, six production mutual aid groups, and eight supply and marketing production groups have been organized in the ironwork, leather, sewing, and foundry industries, accounting for 14 percent of the total number of handicraft workers.

    Before liberation, it was difficult to find a modern industrial machine in Kashgar. Today, with the care of the Party and the government, and with the support of the people from all over the country, many industrial machines have been transported from Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, and other places. Many engineering and technical personnel have also come from all over the country, and some factories with modern equipment have begun to be built here. The Kashgar Flour Mill, the Kashgar Farm Implement Factory, and the Kashgar Ceramics Factory have already been put into production. In the past, Kyrgyz and Tajik herders in remote pastoral areas could not even eat coarse grains. Now, after selling their livestock products to the state, they can carry back high-quality flour from here. The Kashgar Farm Implement Factory supplied 1,350 walking plows to farmers of all ethnic groups in the first half of this year. The Kashgar Power Plant is also actively preparing for construction, and next year, the city's lighting and factory electricity will be fully supplied.

    Kashgar's cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also developed rapidly. Originally, the city had only one poorly equipped primary normal school, with a maximum of just over 500 students. Now, the normal school has been reorganized and expanded; in addition, a middle school has been added. These two secondary schools have a total of more than 1,900 students from seven ethnic groups, including more than 20 children from Kyrgyz and Tajik herders on the Pamir Plateau. The number of primary school students in the city has increased two and a half times compared with before liberation. The People's Hospital, built in the scenic area on the north bank of the Kashgar River, is well-equipped and can accommodate more than 100 inpatients. Farmers and herdsmen from all over can come here for treatment. Over the past five years, more than 13,000 poor people have received free treatment. In the city's People's Club and the People's Park open-air theater, citizens can often see rich and colorful artistic performances by song and dance troupes of various ethnic groups. The number of cinemas has increased from one at the time of liberation to the current four. In August of this year, when the film "Hasan and Jamila" was shown, 30,000 citizens watched this film reflecting the struggle life of the Kazakh people of Xinjiang.

    南疆的政治经济文化中心——喀什
    天南
    在新疆塔里木大戈壁西缘环形的绿洲中间，有座维吾尔族人民的古老的城市——喀什，相传已经有两千年的历史。长久以来，她一直是新疆南部的政治、经济和文化的中心。前新疆省人民政府南疆行政公署就设立在这里。全市有维吾尔、汉、回、柯尔克孜、乌孜别克、俄罗斯、塔吉克、塔塔尔等十三个民族的居民近五万人。
    今天，古城的面貌变得格外年轻美丽。三年以前，城郊区还是一片荒凉，现在矗起了一座座银灰色的建筑物，有机关，有医院，有工厂，有学校。还有许多新的建筑正在加紧施工。一座占地五百多亩的人民公园已在城南修建起来，园内建筑有具有浓厚民族色彩的人民文化宫和露天剧场，遍地栽植了花草树木，它是各族劳动人民最喜爱的游憩场所。由市中心大巴扎直通城南郊区的约一公里长的马路，已经竣工，路面平坦，可以并行三辆汽车。马路两旁正在建筑房屋，一两年后，这里将是一条繁华的大街。
    从唐、宋以来，喀什的商业贸易从来没有像现在这样繁荣。市内北大街和大巴扎一带是集中的商业区，有十六个国营贸易公司、百货商店、专业公司和合作社的门市部，还有二千六百户私营商店。各族人民在这里可以随意地买到自己喜爱的来自祖国各地的绸、缎、呢、绒、胶靴、茶叶、食糖等日用品。国营合作、贸易机构也大量收购全国著名的和阗毛毯、蚕丝、玉石和克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州出产的皮、毛、肠衣，以及南疆各地的干果等土特产品。
    喀什是个手工业生产相当发达的城市，全市百分之二十四的人口从事燃料、金属、建筑、陶瓷、木器、纺织、缝纫、皮革等手工业生产。这里出产的维吾尔族精致的绣花小帽驰名全国。解放前，手工业者大部分濒于破产，解放后，经国营经济的大力扶持，手工业生产得到了恢复和发展。国家在过渡时期的总任务公布以后，手工业者纷纷要求组织起来，走互助合作的道路。现在，铁工、皮革、缝纫、翻砂四个行业中已组织了五个生产合作社、六个生产互助组和八个供销生产小组，人数占手工业从业人员总数的百分之十四。
    在解放前的喀什，是很难找到一架现代化的工业机器的。今天，在党和政府的关怀下，在祖国各地人民的支援下，许多工业机器从上海、天津、沈阳等地运来了，从祖国各地也来了许多工程技术人员，这里开始建筑了一些现代设备的工厂。已经投入生产的有喀什面粉厂、喀什农具厂和喀什陶瓷厂。边远牧区的柯尔克孜、塔吉克族牧民过去连粗粮都吃不到，现在他们把畜产品卖给国家以后，就从这里驮回去上等面粉。喀什农具厂今年上半年供给各族农民步犁一千三百五十架。喀什发电厂也正在积极筹备修建，明年，全市照明及工厂用电就可以得到充分的供给。
    喀什的文化、教育、卫生事业也有迅速的发展。原来全市只有一个设备简陋的初等师范学校，学生最多时只有五百多人，现在师范学校已经过整顿和扩充；另外还增设了一所中学。这两所中等学校共有包括七个民族的学生一千九百多人，其中二十多人是来自帕米尔高原上的柯尔克孜族和塔吉克族牧民的子弟。全市小学生人数较解放前增加了两倍半。修建在喀什噶尔河北岸风景区的人民医院，设备完善，能容纳一百多病人住院。各地农民和牧民有病都能够到这里治疗。五年多来受到免费治疗的贫苦群众有一万三千多人。在市人民俱乐部和人民公园露天剧场，市民们经常可以看到各民族歌舞团丰富多采的艺术表演。电影院已由解放时的一个增加到现有的四个。今年八月，影片“哈森与加米拉”放映时，就有三万市民观看了这部反映新疆哈萨克民族斗争生活的影片。
