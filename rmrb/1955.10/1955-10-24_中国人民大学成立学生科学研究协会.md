    The first member meeting of the China People's University Student Science Research Association was held on the 22nd, formally establishing the China People's University Student Science Research Association.

    At the member meeting, the preparatory committee of the China People's University Student Science Research Association reported on the preparatory process, adopted the "Charter of the China People's University Student Science Research Association," and elected the committee members of the Student Science Research Association. The charter of the Student Science Research Association stipulates that the mission of the association is to cultivate students' ability to think and work independently, to organize and lead students' scientific activities throughout the university, and to exchange experiences in students' scientific research work.

    At the meeting, the political economics science group of the third grade of the Economics Department of China People's University, and the trade organization and technology science group of the fourth grade of the Trade Department, respectively read out their scientific reports "The Task of Agricultural Cooperativization in China's First Five-Year Plan" and "A Study of the Work of Salespersons at the No. 18 Distribution Office of the Dongsi District Consumer Cooperative in Beijing."

    China People's University Vice-President Zou Lufeng, Soviet expert and President Advisor Sbanovsky, both spoke at the meeting. They unanimously pointed out the important significance of the establishment of the Student Science Research Association for students to engage in scientific activities in the future. They encouraged them to actively participate in this activity in order to cultivate independent research capabilities.

    Organizations from the Beijing Municipal Communist Youth League and some universities in Beijing also sent representatives to participate and congratulate the establishment of the China People's University Student Science Research Association.

    Since its establishment, China People's University, under the guidance and assistance of teachers in some teaching and research departments, has successively organized more than 40 student scientific research groups, absorbing more than 400 students to participate in scientific research activities. Most scientific research groups can spend two to four hours a week on this activity. Some groups of students also used their summer vacation to write papers. The association was established on the basis of the work of these groups. (Xinhua News Agency)

    会员大会上，中国人民大学学生科学研究协会筹备委员会报告了筹备经过，通过了“中国人民大学学生科学研究协会章程”，选出了学生科学研究协会委员会委员。学生科学研究协会章程中规定了协会的任务是为了培养学生独立思考、独立工作能力，组织、领导全校学生的科学活动，交流学生科学研究工作的经验。
    会上，中国人民大学经济系三年级的政治经济学科学小组，和贸易系四年级的贸易组织与技术科学小组，分别宣读了他们的科学报告“我国第一个五年计划关于农业合作化的任务”和“北京东四区消费合作社第十八分销处销售员工作的研究”。

    中国人民大学自建校以来，在部分教研室教师的指导和帮助下，先后组织过四十多个学生科学研究小组，吸收了四百多个学生参加了科学研究活动。大部分科学研究小组每周都能以二至四小时的时间从事这一活动。有些组的学生还利用暑假进行论文写作。协会就是在这些小组工作的基础上成立起来的。　（新华社）
