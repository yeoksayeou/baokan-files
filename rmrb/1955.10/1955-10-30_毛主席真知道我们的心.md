    Chairman Mao Truly Knows Our Hearts
    To the Editor:

    Farmers in Baiquan District, Xi'an County, Jilin Province, widely expressed after hearing the instructions from the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao regarding the agricultural cooperation issue: Chairman Mao truly knows our hearts.

    As early as the time of putting away farm tools last year, the Baiquan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party approved the establishment of seventy-five new agricultural production cooperatives in the district. However, there were still more than forty year-round mutual aid teams, totaling more than eight hundred and ten poor peasants and lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants, who continued to sign up requesting the establishment of cooperatives. At that time, district and village leaders lacked understanding of the farmers' enthusiasm for taking the socialist road and did not approve it. These farmers insisted on running the mutual aid teams well and creating conditions for transitioning to cooperatives. The Anquan Village Zhuang Bixin mutual aid team, which was not approved to establish a cooperative, has expanded into a large team of nineteen households and has established an organization for managing production. They frequently went to nearby cooperatives to learn how to use farm tools and farming techniques, preparing to lay the foundation for establishing a cooperative.

    This year, agricultural production cooperatives throughout the district generally achieved a bumper harvest. The Youyi Cooperative in Lianxing Village utilized the Liao River water source this year to convert eight hundred mu of alkaline wasteland into paddy fields, achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average yield of seven hundred and sixty-five jin of rice per mu. The income of cooperative members was more than three times higher than that of farmers outside the cooperative. The Gongfeng Cooperative in Gong'an Village planted twenty-nine mu of corn, and due to the large labor force, manure was applied three times. The large ridges were changed to small ridges and reasonable close planting was implemented, resulting in an average yield of one thousand three hundred jin per mu. Farmers in the vicinity, seeing this situation, were even more eager to establish and join cooperatives.

    After studying the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Baiquan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has begun to attach importance to cultivating this socialist enthusiasm among farmers and decided that from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, the number of agricultural production cooperatives should be increased from the existing ninety-one to one hundred and forty-six. The proportion of farm households joining cooperatives should be increased from 30 percent to 61 percent of the total farm households. As of October 19, sixty-one mutual aid teams, totaling approximately one thousand one hundred farm households, in the district had jointly signed and sealed applications to establish cooperatives, and more than three hundred and thirty farm households had registered with the old cooperatives requesting to join. The District Committee, based on the plans of each village branch for cooperation, approved the establishment of cooperatives for a large number of mutual aid teams and dispatched work teams to help the mutual aid teams establish cooperatives. Sun Baofu, a poor peasant in Zhao Family Village, said happily after joining the cooperative: "There are too many difficulties in not taking the road of cooperation. When plowing in the spring, I only had one weak ox, so I had to have the livestock pull one side of the plow, and I pulled the other side myself, acting as livestock for the entire spring. Once I joined the cooperative, I could no longer have people pull that plow." The mutual aid teams that were approved to establish cooperatives actively improved the autumn harvest and added means of production. After receiving the news that the District Committee had approved the establishment of a cooperative, the Zhuang Bixin mutual aid team purchased a Liberation-style waterwheel, dug a well, and formulated a plan to develop ninety mu of paddy fields next year.

    Currently, the Baiquan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has assigned the district cadres to take charge of fixed key cooperatives, and village cadres are implementing a system of assigning responsibility for individual cooperatives. A wave of learning how to run cooperatives has been launched throughout the district. A mutual aid and cooperation network has also been widely established in each village.

### 毛主席真知道我们的心

    毛主席真知道我们的心编辑同志：
    吉林省西安县白泉区农民，听到了党中央和毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示以后，普遍反映：毛主席真知道我们的心。
    还是去年挂锄的时候，中共白泉区委批准了全区新建七十五个农业生产合作社；但是，仍然有四十多个常年互助组、共八百一十多户贫农和新、老中农中的下中农继续报名要求成立合作社。当时区、村领导对农民这种走社会主义道路的积极性缺乏认识，没有批准。这些农民就坚持办好互助组，创造转社条件。没被批准建社的安泉村庄必信互助组已经扩大成为一个十九户的大组，并且成立了管理生产的组织，经常到附近合作社里学习使用农具和耕作技术，准备给建社打下底子。
    今年，全区农业生产合作社普遍得到了丰收。连兴村友谊社今年利用辽河水源，将八百亩碱洼地改为水田，获得了百年来所未有的大丰收，每亩平均打七百六十五斤稻子，社员收入比社外农民高三倍多。共安村共丰社二十九亩玉米，由于人多力足，上了三次粪，又把大垅改小垅和施行了合理密植，因此每亩平均打了一千三百斤。附近的农民看到了这种情况，要求建社、入社的心情更迫切了。
    中共白泉区委学习了党中央和毛主席的指示以后，已经开始重视培植农民这种社会主义积极性，决定从一九五五年冬到一九五六年春，农业生产合作社要由现有的九十一个发展到一百四十六个，入社农户在总农户中的比例要由百分之三十发展到百分之六十一。到十月十九日止，全区已有六十一个互助组、约一千一百多户农民联名盖章申请办社，有三百三十多户农民向老社报名挂号要求入社。区委根据各村支部对合作化的规划，批准了一大批互助组建社，同时派出了工作队帮助互助组建社。赵家村贫农孙宝福入社以后，高兴地说：“不走合作化道路困难太多了。春天耕地时，我只有一头弱牛，只好牲口拉一头犁，我自己拉了一头犁，当了一春天的牲口。入了社就不能拿人拉这头犁了。”被批准建社的互助组都积极搞好秋收，增添生产资料。庄必信互助组接到了区委批准建社的消息后，添买了一台解放式水车，打了一眼井，并制定出明年开发九十亩水田的计划。
    现在中共白泉区委已给区干部包干，各人固定重点社，村干部实行分社包干，全区开展了学习办社的热潮。互助合作网也已在各村普遍建立。
