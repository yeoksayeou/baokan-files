Sowing of winter wheat is underway in full swing in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Xinjiang and other provinces and regions; Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei and other provinces are beginning or will soon begin sowing winter wheat.

By the end of September, Hebei Province had sown 3,345,000 mu of wheat, accounting for 10.8% of the province's wheat planting plan. Cangxian and Tangshan Special Districts have made faster progress in wheat sowing. Cangxian Special District has now completed 22.8% of its wheat sowing task, and Tangshan Special District has completed 22.5% of its wheat sowing task. In the work of sowing wheat, the Party and government leading organs in many areas have led farmers to launch a shock wheat planting campaign, achieving simultaneous autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and sowing.

By the beginning of October, the wheat fields in Linyi, Heze, Laiyang, Jiaozhou and other special districts in Shandong Province have been basically plowed, and sowing is now being accelerated. Due to the continuous consolidation, expansion, and increase of agricultural production cooperatives, the quality of autumn plowing and autumn sowing in many areas this year has improved compared with previous years. In the agricultural production cooperatives in Liaocheng, Heze, Tai'an, Jiaozhou, Linyi and other places, many autumn plowing depths have increased by half an inch to one inch compared with last year. In sowing, the area of wheat fields planting improved varieties, implementing close planting, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests has been expanded, and the application of base fertilizer has also increased.

In Lushi, Luanchuan, Songxian, Yiyang, Lingbao, and Shanxian counties in the Luoyang Special District of Henan Province, farmers are either sowing winter wheat or have completed sowing. The Xinxiang Special District on the north bank of the Yellow River has also begun sowing wheat. Various localities are implementing yield-increasing measures in wheat sowing, vigorously promoting mixed cropping of wheat with peas or lentils. In areas with mixed cropping habits, measures and plans have been formulated this year to ensure increased production from mixed cropping. In areas without mixed cropping habits, efforts are being made to mobilize the masses to implement intercropping.

In Shaanxi Province, autumn harvesting and autumn sowing are carried out simultaneously. In mid-September, counties in the Weibei Plateau of Baoji Special District, such as Chunhua, Xunyi, Yongshou, Changwu, and Luochuan, Huangling, and Yijun in the Yan'an Special District, had already sown nearly half of the wheat area. Ganquan, Yan'an, Anse and other places have also begun sowing wheat. Before the autumn harvest and autumn sowing, many agricultural cooperatives in various places formulated production plans to do a good job in autumn harvesting and autumn sowing.

The agricultural production troops of the Xinjiang Military Region have completed sowing more than 400,000 mu of winter wheat. This year's winter wheat planting area has been expanded by more than 25% compared with last year. The reclamation areas of various troops in northern Xinjiang began sowing in early September and finished sowing in late September; the reclamation areas of various troops in southern Xinjiang began sowing in mid-September and finished sowing in early October. By the end of September, the early sown winter wheat had emerged.

In Shanxi Province, where winter wheat is grown, most of the wheat fields have been plowed twice by mid-September. In order to deeply plow the wheat fields, more than 10,000 double-wheeled double-share plows have been allocated to the province, and most of them are now in use. At the same time, various localities have also prepared more than 4 million jin of excellent wheat seeds, which have now been transferred to the masses. Many agricultural production cooperatives have also carried out seed germination tests. In order to promote the close planting method of "narrow rows, uniform sowing, and appropriate increase in sowing amount," various localities have focused on reforming the seed drill, and the province plans to reform 51,226 close planting drills. In addition, Shanxi Province has also allocated a large number of agents for preventing and controlling underground pests and seed dressing.

In the Xuzhou-Huaiyin area, the main wheat-producing area of Jiangsu Province, the broad masses of farmers are actively preparing for wheat sowing, and autumn plowing and fertilizer accumulation are generally progressing faster and better than in previous years. In the autumn harvest, farmers generally achieved simultaneous harvesting and plowing.

Farmers in various parts of Anhui have accumulated more than 630 million dan of fertilizer. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups are busy repairing and adding farm tools, selecting and drying seeds, and plowing autumn fields. High-quality wheat seeds sufficient for sowing 20 million mu are being successively transferred to various regions.

Hubei Province plans to expand the promotion of Nanda 2419 wheat to more than 5 million mu this year, and this batch of improved varieties is being transferred from Sichuan Province. Farmers in various places are also working hard to accumulate fertilizer. In Hanchuan County, more than 100,000 dan of fertilizer was accumulated in the ten-odd days of mid-to-late September.

    各产麦区紧张播种冬小麦
    本报讯　河北、山东、河南、陕西、新疆等地正在紧张播种小麦；山西、江苏、安徽、湖北等地已开始或即将开始播种冬小麦。
    到九月底，河北省已播种小麦三百三十四万五千亩，占全省种麦计划的百分之十点八。沧县、唐山两专区种麦进度较快，沧县专区现已完成种麦任务的百分之二十二点八，唐山专区完成种麦任务的百分之二十二点五。在播种小麦工作中，不少地区的党政领导机关领导农民掀起了突击种麦运动，做到了边秋收、边秋耕、边播种。
    到十月初，山东省临沂、菏泽、莱阳、胶州等专区的麦田已基本耕完，现正加紧播种。由于农业生产合作社的不断巩固扩大和增多，今年不少地区的秋耕秋种质量较往年提高。聊城、菏泽、泰安、胶州、临沂等地的农业生产合作社，不少秋耕地比去年加深了半寸至一寸。在播种中，种植良种、实行密植和防治病虫害的麦田面积扩大，施基肥也增多。
    河南省洛阳专区的卢氏、栾川、嵩县、伊阳、灵宝、陕县农民有的正在播种冬小麦，有的已播种完毕。黄河北岸的新乡专区，也开始种麦。各地在麦播中贯彻增产措施，大力推行麦子同豌豆或扁豆混作。在有混作习惯的地区，今年都订出了保证混作增产的措施和计划。在没有混作习惯的地区，动员群众实行间作。
    陕西省各地秋收秋播工作交错进行。九月中旬，宝鸡专区渭北高原各县如淳化、栒邑、永寿、长武以及延安专区的洛川、黄陵、宜君等地，就已播种了将近一半面积的小麦。甘泉、延安、安塞等地也已开始播种小麦。在秋收秋播前，各地不少的农业合作社都订出作好秋收秋播的生产计划。
    新疆军区农业生产部队已播完四十多万亩冬麦。今年冬麦播种的面积比去年扩大了百分之二十五以上。北疆各部队垦区九月上旬先后开始播种，下旬播完；南疆各部队垦区九月中旬开始播种，十月初播完。九月底，早播的冬麦已经出土。
    山西全省冬麦种植地区，截至九月中旬止大部分麦田都已耕过二次。为了深耕麦田，全省调拨了一万多部双轮双铧犁，现在大部分已使用起来。各地同时还准备了优良麦种四百多万斤，现已调到群众手中。许多农业生产合作社还进行了种籽发芽试验。为推广“窄行、匀种、适当增加播种量”的密植法，各地着重进行了改耧工作，全省计划改制密植耧五万一千二百二十六张。此外，山西省还调拨了大批防治地下害虫和拌种的药剂。
    江苏省小麦主要产区徐州淮阴地区，广大农民积极为小麦播种进行准备工作，秋耕、积肥等普遍比往年进展得又快又好。在秋收中，农民们普遍做到了边收边耕。
    安徽各地农民已积储肥料六亿三千多万担。许多农业生产合作社和互助组，都在忙着修补和增添农具，选晒种籽，翻犁秋地。供播种二千万亩的小麦良种，正向各地区陆续调运中。
    湖北省今年计划扩大推广南大二四一九小麦到五百多万亩，这批良种正向四川省调运中。各地农民并努力积肥，汉川县九月中下旬的十多天就积肥十多万担。
