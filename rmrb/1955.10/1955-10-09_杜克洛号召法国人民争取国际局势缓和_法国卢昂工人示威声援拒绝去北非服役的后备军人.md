Xinhua News Agency, October 8th, Paris dispatch: "l'Humanité" published an article by French Communist Party Secretary Duclos commenting on the international situation and French policy. He called on the French public to strive to make the French government pursue a policy that promotes further reconciliation. He particularly emphasized that accepting the proposal to establish a European collective security system with the participation of both parts of Germany would meet the needs of strengthening peace and the national interests of France. He pointed out that the issue of disarmament should be resolved.

Duclos criticized the French government's decision to postpone the visit of French politicians to Moscow. He pointed out that such a visit could greatly help resolve pressing international issues.

Duclos emphasized that the further relaxation of international tensions depends first and foremost on the vigilance and activity of the people. He called on the people to intensify the struggle for a peaceful settlement of all international disputes and to ensure the success of the Geneva Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference.

Xinhua News Agency, October 8th, Paris dispatch: Paris news: On the evening of October 7, 1,500 working people in Rouen, France, held a demonstration to support the recent action of 500 reserve personnel of the artillery regiment, who had been conscripted into active service, in refusing to go to North Africa to suppress the local people's national independence movement.

These reservists resisted on the evening of the 6th when officers ordered them to set off for North Africa. They refused to get on the trucks and closed the gates of the barracks, preventing the trucks from carrying away their comrades who had been forced onto the vehicles. The French authorities sent a large number of "Republican Security Forces" to surround the barracks, and successively transferred reinforcements from Arras, Lille and other cities to strengthen the suppression forces. But throughout the 7th, the artillery reservists continued to persist.

In the twilight of the 7th, workers from various factories in Rouen went to the front of the barracks after work to support the reservists who were persisting in their resistance under heavy siege. The "Republican Security Forces" dispersed the workers. But soon the workers lined up again on the streets of Rouen and marched towards the barracks, and the number of people participating in the demonstration increased greatly. When the workers demonstrated in front of the barracks, the reservists also shouted in the barracks: "We don't want to go to Africa!"

The "Republican Security Forces" and the police used tear gas to attack the demonstrating workers. As a result of the conflict between the two sides, many people were injured.

    杜克洛批评法国政府推迟法国政治家访问莫斯科的决定。他指出，这种访问可以大大有助于解决迫切的国际问题。
    杜克洛强调国际紧张局势的进一步缓和首先取决于人民的警惕性和活动，他号召人民加紧进行斗争，争取和平解决一切国际争执问题，保证日内瓦四大国外长会议成功。
    新华社八日讯　巴黎消息：十月七日晚上，法国卢昂有一千五百个劳动人民举行示威，声援最近被征服现役的五百个炮兵联队后备役人员拒绝去北非镇压当地人民民族独立运动的行动。
    这些后备役军人是在六日晚间当军官命令他们动身去北非的时候实行反抗的。他们拒绝上卡车，并且把兵营的大门关起来，使卡车不能把被迫上了车的伙伴们载走。法国当局派出大批“共和国保安队”包围兵营，并且陆续从阿拉、里尔和其他城市调来增援部队，加强镇压力量。但是在七日整天，炮兵后备军人仍然在坚持着。
    七日黄昏，卢昂各工厂的工人在下班后到兵营前声援在重重包围下坚持反抗的后备军人。“共和国保安队”把工人们赶散了。但是不久工人们又在卢昂的街道上列队向兵营前进，参加示威行列的人还大大增加了。当工人们在兵营前示威的时候，后备军人们也在兵营里高呼：“我们不愿意去非洲！”
    “共和国保安队”和警察用催泪弹来攻击示威工人。双方冲突结果，有许多人受伤。
