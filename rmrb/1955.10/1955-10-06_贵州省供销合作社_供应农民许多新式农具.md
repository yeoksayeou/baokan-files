    Guizhou Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    Supplies Farmers with Many New Types of Farm Tools
    This year, in addition to supplying farmers with a large number of new-style farm tools such as hillside plows and seven-inch walking plows, the Guizhou Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also supplied a large number of new-style funnel threshers and foot-operated corn threshers. From August 5th to mid-September, it has supplied farmers with 8,393 threshers and 5,503 corn threshers. These new-style farm tools have been warmly welcomed by farmers of all ethnic groups and have greatly improved labor productivity. The Chengguan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baiyun District, Guizhou County, used funnel threshers to increase production efficiency by more than three times compared to hand threshing, and it can prevent scattering. The foot-operated corn thresher increased efficiency by more than seventeen times compared to manual threshing. In order to enable farmers of all ethnic groups to better master and use the operating techniques of new-style farm tools, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Guizhou Farm Tool Factory sent four working groups to Guiding, Zunyi, Anshun and other areas to help install and repair them.

    贵州省供销合作社
    供应农民许多新式农具
    贵州省供销合作社今年除对农民供应了大量的山地犁和七寸步犁等新式农具外，还供应大批新式漏斗打谷机和脚踏玉米脱粒机。从八月五日至九月中旬止，已供应农民打谷机八千三百九十三部、玉米脱粒机五千五百零三部。这些新式农具受到了各族农民的热烈欢迎，并大大地提高了劳动生产效率。贵筑县白云区程官农业生产合作社用漏斗打谷机比用手打谷子提高了生产效率三倍以上，并能防止抛撒。脚踏玉米脱粒机比用手工脱粒提高了十七倍以上的效率。为了使各族农民兄弟更好掌握和使用新式农具的操作技术，省农林厅和贵州农具厂派了四个工作组到贵定、遵义、安顺等专区帮助安装修理。（本报驻贵阳记者）
