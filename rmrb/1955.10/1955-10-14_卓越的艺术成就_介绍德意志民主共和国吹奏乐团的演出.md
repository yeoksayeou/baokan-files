Outstanding Artistic Achievement
    ——Introducing the Performance of the German Democratic Republic Wind Orchestra
    Luo Lang, Head of the Military Band of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    The German Democratic Republic Wind Orchestra, which is currently visiting our country, is a chamber wind ensemble with a long history. It is the wind section of the State Orchestra of Dresden, a famous cultural city in Germany. The Dresden State Orchestra was founded more than four hundred years ago, and many famous German classical musicians, such as Weber and Wagner, have conducted this orchestra. The chamber wind ensemble has also been established for more than a hundred years. It is one of the music art groups loved by the German people. For more than a hundred years, it has been playing music specially composed for chamber wind ensembles by musical masters such as Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart, and the orchestra has always maintained its own performance style.

    Wind instruments are easier to learn than string instruments, but they are more difficult to master, because the strength of wind instruments lies in expressing powerful musical phrases, while expressing very soft and sustained lyrical phrases is technically much more difficult than with string instruments. The German Democratic Republic Wind Orchestra showed us extremely high skills in wind instrument playing. When the concert began, after the artists sat down amidst applause, the first chord of the Beethoven Quartet sounded, followed by a continuation of several extremely soft chords. From the very beginning, the four artists demonstrated their high artistic accomplishment and expressive ability. They played every note of the composer with extreme accuracy, regardless of legato or staccato, extremely loud or extremely soft, very slow or extremely fast, and all emotional changes were expressed extremely subtly and harmoniously. All of this requires extremely high technique, a high degree of cooperation, and artistic accomplishment.

    Chamber music performance is relatively rare in our country, and it is even rarer to have a chamber music performance specifically by a wind orchestra, except for a few Soviet woodwind quintets performed by the Military Band of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. There is currently no dedicated chamber wind ensemble in our country. The visit and performance of the German Democratic Republic Chamber Wind Orchestra in our country will undoubtedly arouse our interest in this performance form. Ensemble playing can more accurately cultivate the spirit of cooperation among band members and improve performance techniques, because each part is played by only one performer, and any weakness in technique or expressive ability will be clearly exposed to the audience, and any poor cooperation among the members will cause the entire piece to suffer. Therefore, ensemble playing is one of the most important ways to strictly train ensemble members. German classical composers and modern composers have attached great importance to wind instruments and have created many chamber music works specifically for wind orchestras to perform, becoming a traditional form of concert performance.

    Because of the small number of people involved in chamber music, and because the pieces are relatively light and short, it is suitable for small-scale performances in various occasions, so it is easier to reach the broad masses of the people and is more suitable as a cultural appreciation activity for the broad masses of the people on their days off.

    During its visit and performance in our country, the German Democratic Republic Wind Orchestra will successively perform works by classical composers such as Bach, Mozart, Handel, and Haydn, as well as modern composers such as Reinholt and Kutz, some of which will be very new to our audiences. Our music workers, especially wind instrument players, will learn from their excellent skills and rich experience.

    卓越的艺术成就
    ——介绍德意志民主共和国吹奏乐团的演出
    中国人民解放军军乐团团长　罗浪
    这次来我国访问的德意志民主共和国吹奏乐团是一个有着悠久历史的室内乐管乐团。它是德国有名的文化城德累斯顿的国家乐团的管乐部分。德累斯顿国家乐团创办已有四百多年，德国许多有名的古典音乐家，如魏伯、华格纳等都指挥过这个乐团。室内乐管乐团的创办也已经有一百多年了。它是德国人民所喜爱的音乐艺术团体之一。一百多年来，它一直演奏着巴赫、贝多芬、莫扎特等音乐大师专门为室内乐管乐团所创作的乐曲，这个乐团一直保持着他们自己的演奏风格。
    管乐比弦乐容易学，但却比弦乐难于学好，因为管乐的特长在于表现强有力的乐句，而表现很弱而延续的抒情乐句，在技巧上要比弦乐难得多。德意志民主共和国吹奏乐团，使我们看到了管乐吹奏上的极高的技巧。当演奏会开始，艺术家们在掌声中安坐下来之后，贝多芬四重奏的第一个和弦响起了，紧接着就是几个极弱音和弦的延续。一开始，四位艺术家就显示了他们的高度的艺术素养和表现能力。他们以极准确的技术演奏了作曲家的每一个音符，不管连音或顿音，不管特强或特弱，不管很慢或特快等，各种感情的变化，都表现得极其入微，而且非常谐和。这些都需要极高的技术、高度的合作精神和艺术素养的。
    室内乐的演奏在我国是比较少的，而专门由管乐团演奏室内乐，除了中国人民解放军军乐团曾表演过苏联的几首木管五重奏外，就更少见。在我国现在也还没有专门的室内乐管乐团。德意志民主共和国的室内乐管乐团这次来我国进行访问演出，无疑地将会引起我们对这种演奏形式的兴趣。重奏能更准确地培养乐队人员的合作精神和提高演奏技术，因为每个声部都只有一位演奏员担任，任何一个人的技术上和表现能力上的弱点，都会很明显地暴露在听众面前，任何团员合作得不好就会使整个乐曲受到损失。因此重奏是严格训练合奏人员很重要的办法之一。德国的古典作曲家和现代作曲家都非常重视管乐，并创作了许多专门为管乐团演奏的室内乐作品，成为音乐会演奏的一种传统形式。
    室内乐由于人数少，乐曲也比较轻松，比较短小，适合于在各种场合举行小规模的演奏，所以也就更便于接近广大的人民，更适合于作为广大人民休息日的文化欣赏。
    德意志民主共和国吹奏乐团在我国的访问演出中，将陆续演奏巴赫、莫扎特、韩德尔、海登等古典作曲家和兰因霍尔特、库茨等现代作曲家的作品，其中有的作品，对我国的听众来说，是十分新鲜的。我们的音乐工作者，特别是管乐演奏者将从他们的优秀演技和丰富的经验中得到教益。
