Unforgettable Impressions
Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Wei Belousov

A few months ago, I participated in a delegation from the Soviet Academy of Sciences to the People's Republic of China. The time spent in China gave us vivid impressions that will be unforgettable for a lifetime.

Undoubtedly, the people of People's China gave us extraordinary impressions. On the streets of Beijing, in the scientific research laboratories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in the rice paddies of the southern provinces, in the factories of the Northeast, in the geological exploration teams – wherever we encountered them, we saw many commonalities in all the people of today's People's China. This commonality is a skillful combination of diligence, loyalty, competence, responsibility, and the ability to work well and harmoniously in a collective. The discipline based on a deep understanding of one's responsibilities, which the Chinese workers demonstrate so excellently in their daily life and work, made an unforgettable impression on us.

The achievements made by the Chinese people in all aspects of life in the short period since the establishment of the People's Republic also deeply impressed us. These achievements are noticeable everywhere: the chimneys of many new factories on the outskirts of Shenyang are smoking; numerous new buildings of scientific research institutes have appeared in the suburbs of Beijing; many new schools have been built in various regions of the country; new railways are being built, and the number of agricultural cooperatives is growing; the health care sector has made great achievements, and so on. The speed of modern China's construction and the speed of cultural and technological development are quite astonishing: it is as if a tightly wound spring has suddenly sprung open. I am reminded of a representative example related to my profession: when we left Moscow, according to the original understanding, there were eleven seismic stations in China (only two before liberation); when we arrived in Beijing, there were seventeen, and on the eve of our departure for home, we received a statistical table, which already listed twenty-four stations.

We were very happy to see the "May Day" parade in Beijing, which impressed us with its splendor, diversity, and energy. I especially remember the rows of Young Pioneers in white clothes standing on the square opposite the rostrum. Every time a congratulatory cheer was issued from the rostrum, the Young Pioneers raised bouquets of flowers. At that time, their ranks turned into a beautiful and picturesque flowerbed being blown by the wind in a matter of seconds. In the midst of the enthusiastic parade, hundreds of pigeons flew into the sky above the parade and circled over the square for a long time.

I miss the magnificent architecture of the Forbidden City in Beijing and its vast courtyards paved with large flagstones and surrounded by marble colonnades, and I miss the enchanting Temple of Heaven and its extraordinary echo wall on the edge of the capital city. The stone beasts on both sides of the boulevards seen on the outskirts of Nanjing are astonishing.

The uniquely distinctive nature of China also left an indelible impression on us. Can one forget the rice paddies of the red soil zone, as colorful as shells? From the plane, these rice paddies look like fish scales; or, can one forget the huge limestone cliffs on the gently undulating plains of Guangxi Province? These rocks are like the helmets of mythical giants, chopped and scattered in a brutal battle; or, can one forget the great rivers? They flow with difficulty between extremely vast sandy beaches; finally, can one forget the rapid tropical sunsets in the southern provinces? The transformation from the brightness of day to the darkness of night takes less than ten minutes, and this transition makes you feel unaccustomed to it, more like a performance than a real event.

Finally, returning to what I talked about at the beginning – about the people of China, I want to say that we will deeply remember throughout our lives the kind feelings with which the entire Chinese people received their guests, which always accompanied us everywhere and made our stay in the People's Republic of China very pleasant.

In wholeheartedly congratulating the great Chinese people on the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, I firmly believe that in the coming years, the Chinese workers will make tremendous achievements in all aspects of the national economy, science, and culture, and turn their beautiful motherland into an even stronger nation.

    难忘的印象
    苏联科学院通讯院士　维·别洛乌索夫
    几个月以前，我曾参加苏联科学院代表团到过中华人民共和国。在中国度过的时间里，我们获得了一生难忘的鲜明的印象。
    无疑地，人民中国的人们给了我们非凡的印象。在北京的街道上，在中国科学院各研究所的科学研究室里，在南方各省的稻田中，在东北的工厂里，在地质勘探队里——我们无论在哪里遇到他们，我们都在今天人民中国所有的人身上看到许多共同点。这种共同点就是：勤劳、忠诚、有能力、负责任、善于很好地和协调地在集体中工作的巧妙的结合。中国的劳动者在日常生活和工作中卓越地表现出的那种以深刻理解自己的职责为基础的纪律，给我们造成了难忘的印象。
    中国人民在人民共和国建立以来的短时期中在生活的各个方面取得的成就，也给了我们很深的印象。这些成就可以说到处都是惹人注目的：沈阳近郊许多新工厂的烟囱在冒烟；北京郊区出现了为数众多的科学研究所的新建筑；全国各个地区建成了很多的新学校；新的铁路在修建，农业合作社的数目在增长；保健事业取得了巨大的成就，以及其他等等。现代中国建设的速度、文化和技术发展的速度是十分惊人的：就像一个紧紧的弹簧突然伸开了一样。我想起了一个同我的专业相近的具有代表性的例子：当我们离开莫斯科时，根据原来的了解，在中国有十一个地震台（解放前只有两个）；当我们到北京的时候，它原来有十七个，而在动身回国的前夕我们收到了一张统计表，上面已经列有二十四个台了。
    我们很高兴地看到了北京的“五一”节游行，它以自己的华丽、多样性和精力充沛打动了我们。特别记得站在主席台对面广场上的穿着白衣服的少年先锋队队员的队伍。每当主席台上发出祝贺的呼声以后，少先队员就举起花束。那时，他们的队伍在几秒钟里变成了像是一片被风吹拂着的美丽如画的花坛。正值游行热烈的时候，数百只鸽子飞上游行队伍的上空，并长久地在广场上空盘旋。
    我怀念着北京故宫的宏伟的建筑和它的用大块石板铺砌并围以大理石外廊的广阔的庭院，怀念着首都城边迷人的天坛和它的奇异的回音壁。在南京郊区看到的林荫道两旁的石兽是令人惊讶的。
    具有极其独特的特征的中国的大自然也给我们留下了不可磨灭的印象。难道能忘记那像贝壳一样五颜六色的红土地带的稻田吗？从飞机上看来，这些稻田犹如鱼鳞一般；或者，难道能忘记那些在微微起伏的广西省平原上的巨大的石灰石峭壁吗？这些岩石就像在残酷的战斗中被砍碎和抛散的神话般的巨人的钢盔；或者，难道能忘记那些大河吗？它们在极其广阔的沙滩间困难地穿流着；最后，难道能忘记那南方各省神速的热带的日落吗？从白昼的明亮到夜的黑暗还不到十分钟，这转变使你不习惯地感到它与其说是真事，毋宁说更像演戏。
    末了，再回到我在开头所谈的——关于中国的人们，我要说，我们一生都会深深记得全中国人民接待自己的客人的那种亲切的感情，它一直是到处伴随着我们，并使我们在中华人民共和国逗留期间感到非常愉快。
    在衷心地向伟大的中国人民祝贺人民共和国成立六周年的时候，我坚决相信，在最近几年内，中国的劳动者将在国民经济、科学和文化一切方面取得巨大的成就，把自己美丽的祖国变成更加雄强。
