Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, October 30th. The second phase of agricultural production cooperative rectification work in Shaanxi Province this year is nearing completion. The cooperatives that have undergone rectification are now more consolidated. The rectification work in various areas began between August and September. Most regions dispatched personnel to cooperatives with more problems for key rectification, to drive the surrounding general cooperatives. They also adopted methods such as using old cooperatives to lead new cooperatives, and using advanced cooperatives to lead backward cooperatives, and closely integrated this with the autumn harvest and autumn planting work. The vast majority of cooperatives throughout the province formulated autumn harvest distribution plans and cleared up various accounts during the rectification process. Various localities also rectified the labor organization of the cooperatives in conjunction with current production. In Weinan Prefecture, 90 percent of the cooperatives have now implemented contracting work groups, and many cooperatives have upgraded from seasonal contracting to year-round contracting. All of the more than 100 cooperatives in Hu County have implemented the contracting system this autumn.

Some areas also conducted model selection work during the rectification process. After selecting models, most counties in Weinan Prefecture universally inspected the leadership work of the cooperatives and the work attitude of the members, and conducted a concrete socialist education for the members. During this period, the Chinese Communist Party organizations in Dali County also admitted 35 outstanding cooperative members into the Party. Various localities also cleaned out the bad elements who had infiltrated the cooperatives, purifying the organization of the cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, October 30th. Hunan Province's rural areas are combining the grain "three fix" to household work to rectify the existing more than 13,000 agricultural production cooperatives and consolidate the more than 20,000 new cooperatives established before the autumn harvest. In order to ensure the smooth completion of the cooperative rectification work during the grain work period, the local committees and county committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province convened cadre meetings on cooperative work in early October, and assigned full-time cadres to form cooperative work teams to devote themselves to rectifying old cooperatives, consolidating new cooperatives, and preparing for the re-establishment of new cooperatives. The rectification work of the first batch of more than 7,000 old cooperatives has been fully launched since mid-October, and the typical experimental work of rectifying 259 cooperatives has now been completed.

Through the rectification of old cooperatives, various localities have led the new cooperatives to establish labor organizations and financial accounting systems, so that most new cooperatives have been consolidated in autumn and winter production. At present, most townships with old cooperatives have established a liaison system of joint meetings between the heads of new and old cooperatives. Representatives of surrounding new cooperatives and mutual aid groups are also invited to participate in the rectification of old cooperatives. As a result, the number of farmers requesting to join the cooperatives is increasing day by day.

    陕西省经过整顿的农业合作社更加巩固
    湖南结合粮食工作积极整顿农业合作社
    新华社西安三十日电　陕西省今年第二次整顿农业生产合作社的工作即将全部结束。经过整顿的社都更加巩固。各地整社工作是从八、九月间开始的。大部地区都派专人到问题较多的社进行重点整顿，以带动周围一般社，还采取以老社带动新社、以先进社带动落后社等方法，并和秋收秋播工作紧密结合进行。全省绝大部分社在整顿中都制定出秋收分配方案，清理了各种账目。各地还结合当前生产整顿了社的劳动组织。渭南专区现在已有百分之九十的社实行了包工，不少社已从季节包工提高为常年包工。鄠县一百多个社今秋已经全部实行包工制。
    有些地区在整社中还进行评选模范的工作。渭南专区大多数县经过评选模范，普遍检查了社的领导工作和社员的劳动态度，对社员们进行了一次具体的社会主义教育。大荔县的中共党组织在这个期间还接收了三十五个优秀的社员为党员。各地对混入社内的坏分子也进行了清洗，纯洁了社的组织。
    新华社长沙三十日电　湖南省农村正结合粮食“三定”到户的工作整顿原有的一万三千多个农业生产合作社和巩固秋收前建立的二万多个新社。为保证在粮食工作期间做好整社工作，中共湖南省各地方委员会和县委都在十月初召开了合作工作干部会议，并配备专职干部，组成合作化工作队投入整顿老社、巩固新社和再建新社的准备工作。第一批七千多个老社的整顿工作已从十月中旬全面展开，对二百五十九个进行整顿的典型试验工作现在都已结束。
    各地通过整顿老社，带动新社建立了劳动组织和财务会计等制度，使大部分新社在秋、冬生产中得到巩固。现在，凡有老社的乡大多建立了新、老社长联席会议的联系制度，整顿老社时也吸收周围的新社和互助组的代表参加，因此，要求入社的农民日益增多。
