The Big Chum Salmon of the Ussuri River
By Our Correspondent Fang Qing

September is the season for the Ussuri River to produce abundant big chum salmon.

Starting from Fuyuan County in the northeastern corner of our motherland, going south along the river to Hulin County's Hutou Village, on this seven-hundred-li stretch of the river, white sails are everywhere, undulating with the waves. However, the Ussuri River is divided by its center: west of the center are the more than six hundred fishing boats from Fuyuan, Raohe, Hulin, and other places in our country; east of the center are the fishing boats of our great neighbor, the Soviet Union.

The big chum salmon, scientifically known as the salmon, is a marine-returning fish, born in freshwater and growing in seawater. The Ussuri River's big chum salmon spawn every year in September and October. When they grow to three or four inches long, they slowly swim to the lower reaches of the Heilong River, pass through the Tatar Strait, and go to the Sea of Okhotsk. After growing here for about four years, reaching about eight pounds, their reproductive functions mature, and they follow the original route upstream back to the Ussuri River to spawn. A portion travels west along the Heilong River until it meets the Songhua River. Therefore, fishing always takes place at this time of year. In order to take care of its reproduction and development, the Chinese and Soviet fishermen on the Ussuri River have stipulated a closed fishing season after October, and they have strictly adhered to this regulation for several years.

The big chum salmon has a delicious taste and can also be made into salted fish and smoked fish for export. The roe of the big chum salmon is about the size of a soybean, light red, transparent, and contains rich nutrients, making it a favorite food for pilots. The skin of the big chum salmon has beautiful patterns and strong toughness. After simple drying by the fishermen, it can be made into very beautiful leather pants and leather shoes. If it can be chemically treated, its utility value will be greatly improved.

This year, the state-owned aquatic products company signed purchase contracts with fishermen very early, and prepaid a portion of the purchase price in advance to help fishermen purchase fishing gear. Many purchasing stations and four fish processing plants have been established along the river.

The second half of September is the peak season. As of September 23, the Fuyuan area had caught a total of 45,600 fish.

    乌苏里江的大蚂哈鱼
    本报记者　方青
    九月份，是乌苏里江盛产大蚂哈鱼的季节。
    从位于祖国东北角的抚远县起，沿江南下，直到虎林县的虎头村，在这七百里地的江面上，到处是朵朵白帆，随着波澜荡漾。但，乌苏里江是以江心为分界线的：江心西边是我国抚远、饶河、虎林等地的六百多只渔船；江心以东，便是我们伟大的邻邦——苏联渔民的渔船了。
    大蚂哈鱼学名叫鲑鱼，属于海洋回归性鱼类，生在淡水，长在海水。乌苏里江的大蚂哈鱼，每年九、十月间产卵，长到三、四寸时，就慢慢游到黑龙江下游，经过鞑靼海峡，到鄂霍次克海里去。在这里生长约四年后，长到八斤上下的时候，生殖机能成熟，便循着原路逆流而上回到乌苏里江产卵。一部分沿黑龙江西游，直到和松花江汇合处。所以每年都是这个时候捕鱼。为了照顾它的繁殖和发展，乌苏里江上的中苏渔民便规定十月以后为禁捕期，几年来他们都严格遵守这个规定。
    大蚂哈鱼味道鲜美，还可以制成咸鱼、熏鱼外销。大蚂哈鱼的鱼卵，有黄豆大小，淡红色，透明体，含有丰富的养分，是飞行员所最喜欢的食品。大蚂哈鱼的鱼皮，花纹美，韧性强，渔民们只是简单晒制后，便可作成很漂亮的皮裤、皮鞋。如果能够经过化学泡制，将大大提高它的使用价值。
    今年，国营水产公司很早就同渔民签订收购合同，并提前发放一部分预购款，为渔民购置渔具。又在沿江各地设立许多收购站，和四个鱼品加工厂。
    九月下半月是盛产期。截至九月二十三日，抚远地区共捕获四万五千六百尾。
