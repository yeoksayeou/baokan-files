    The copper buckles on sneakers should be replaced with other metals
    Reader Feng Zaimin of Tianjin Public-Private Joint Venture Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory writes: Many sneakers produced by rubber factories use copper double-sided buckles for the eyelets. The amount of copper used by the country each year in this area is considerable. If other metals are used instead, not only can the copper that our country lacks be used where it is more needed, but also the cost of sneakers can be reduced.
    According to the reply from the Rubber Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, in order to save copper, all state-owned rubber factories across the country have switched to single-sided aluminum buckles for the eyelets of sneakers produced since the first quarter of this year, and Lex shoes are also preparing to switch to aluminum or iron buckles. This practice should be widely promoted in local state-owned, public-private joint venture, and private rubber factories.
    Recycle waste mimeograph stencils scattered in various places
    Many readers have written to suggest that relevant departments should purchase waste mimeograph stencils at a price. They point out that although waste mimeograph stencils are scattered and fragmented, the amount is considerable when collected together. It would be a pity if this batch of steel is not utilized.
    The Metal Recycling Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has accepted this suggestion and has notified the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Waste Products General Administration to inform supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels to purchase waste mimeograph stencils at the general scrap steel price. If they cannot be utilized locally after purchase, they can be handed over to the local offices of the Metal Recycling Bureau at the state allocation price.
    Trial production of matchboxes made of hemp cardboard
    The Production Technology Section of the Zhangjiakou City Industrial Bureau writes: Currently, matchboxes are made of wood. We believe that paper and other substitutes can be used as raw materials. Although the amount of wood used for a single matchbox is small, the total amount of wood saved after using substitutes is considerable due to the large production volume of matchboxes.
    According to the reply from the Ministry of Local Industry, this suggestion is feasible. A matchbox made of hemp cardboard has been trial-produced and has achieved initial success.
    A way to save pencil wood
    Reader Xie Feijuan of Tsinghua University writes: The wooden shaft of the pencils we use is only for protecting the lead and making it easier to use. Each pencil uses a wooden shaft, which is shaved off when used, which is a pity. Although automatic pencils on the market do not use wooden shafts, they are very expensive. Therefore, it is recommended to try to produce an automatic pencil with a wooden shaft. In this way, on the one hand, it can save wood for the country, and on the other hand, it can reduce the burden on users.
    The Ministry of Local Industry believes that this idea is very good. Wooden automatic pencils have now been successfully trial-produced and are beginning to be sold in department stores in Beijing and other places.
    Use paper strips instead of cotton wool to fill the gaps in medicine bottles
    Readers Shi Yilong, Diao Yongyu, etc. write: Currently, pharmaceutical factories in various places use cotton wool to fill the gaps in medicine bottles when packaging medicines. In order to save cotton, these cotton wool can be replaced with sterilized shredded paper strips.
    According to the reply from the Pharmaceutical Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, the readers' suggestion is correct. This method has been tried out in Kefayao Factory and other places with good results. We are now summing up experience and preparing to promote it at the upcoming professional conference on drug packaging.

### 一点一滴的节约可能性也应该好好利用

    一点一滴的节约可能性也应该好好利用
    球鞋的铜扣应用其它金属代替
    天津市公私合营大中华橡胶厂读者冯再敏来信说：很多橡胶厂出品的球鞋，鞋眼上用的是铜质的双面扣。国家每年在这方面所用的铜是不少的。如果用其它金属代替，不但可以使我国缺少的铜用到更需要的地方去，也可以降低球鞋的成本。
    据轻工业部橡胶工业管理局答复，为了节约用铜，全国国营橡胶厂所产球鞋从本年第一季度开始，鞋眼扣全部改用单面铝扣，力士鞋也准备改用铝扣或铁扣。这个做法应该在地方国营、公私合营和私营的橡胶厂普遍推行。
    回收散存各地的废誊写钢版
    不少读者来信建议有关部门作价回收废誊写钢版。他们指出，废誊写钢版虽然零星分散，但集中起来数量就不算少了，这批钢材如果不加利用是很可惜的。
    重工业部金属回收管理局已经接受这个建议，通知中华全国供销合作总社废品总管理局转知各级供销合作社按一般废钢价格收购废誊写钢版；收购后如在地方上无法利用，可按国家调拨价格缴金属回收管理局各地办事处接收。
    试制麻版纸的火柴盒
    张家口市工业局生产技术科来信说：目前火柴盒都是用木材制造的，我们觉得可以用纸张等代用品来做原料。一个火柴盒所用的木材虽然很少，但是由于火柴盒的生产量很大，使用代用品后节约木材的总数量就很可观了。
    据地方工业部答复，这个建议是可行的。现在已试制一种用麻版纸做的火柴盒，并已初步获得成功。
    节约铅笔木杆的一个办法
    清华大学读者谢斐娟来信说：我们用的铅笔，其中木杆只是为了保护铅蕊和便于使用。每一支铅笔用一支木杆，使用时都被削掉了，实在很可惜。市上的自动铅笔虽然不用木杆了，但价格很贵，因此建议试制一种木杆的自动铅笔。这样，一方面可以为国家节约木材，另一方面也可以减轻使用者的负担。
    地方工业部认为这个意见很好。现在木杆自动铅笔已经试制成功，并且开始在北京等地百货公司出售。
    用纸条代替药棉来填塞药瓶的空隙
    读者施益龙、刁永玉等来信说：目前各地药厂在包装药品时，都用药棉来填塞药瓶的空隙。为了节约棉花，这些药棉可以用消过毒的碎纸条来代替。
    经轻工业部医药工业管理局答复，读者的建议是正确的。这种办法，经在科发药厂等处试用，成绩尚好；现在正在总结经验，准备在召开药品包装专业会议时加以推广。
