Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: U.S. Under Secretary of State Herbert Hoover Jr. and International Cooperation Administrator Hollister, who are currently on a so-called "visit" to the Far East, left Japan on the 6th, the first country on their itinerary, for activities in South Korea.

According to the U.S. State Department, one of the purposes of Hoover and Hollister's trip to the Far East is to "directly inspect the implementation of the U.S. aid program in the region." On the 5th, they held talks with Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama, Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, and other Japanese government and Democratic Party leaders to discuss the issue of Japanese rearmament and the related issue of Japan's participation in the U.S. "aid" aggression plan in Southeast Asia. Hoover told Hatoyama during the talks that the United States hopes for a "rapid recovery" of the Japanese economy and "ensuring its position as a leader in Asia." According to the International News Service, this means that the United States wants Japan to be able to "strengthen other free Asian nations to meet America's long-term defense goals." That is to say, the United States wants to make Japan a supply base for the American aggressive bloc in Asia.

During the talks, the U.S. side used the $100 million presidential fund to be used to "develop" the Southeast Asian region as bait, asking Japan to "play a huge role" in this regard. Hollister also told Hatoyama that American capital should be imported into Japan to "help" Japanese industry. According to Hollister's logic, "this will be another way to aid Southeast Asia." Hatoyama said, "The Japanese side is willing to absorb (American) technology and capital."

At the same time, the Japanese side had requested during the talks that the U.S. government relax the "embargo" restrictions on China that it was forcing Japan to implement. However, before leaving Tokyo on the 6th, Hoover formally denied reports in Japanese newspapers that he had agreed to relax the "embargo" at a press conference. He said: "U.S. policy opposes changing the current international controls on such trade." According to Agence France-Presse, Hoover and others even warned Japan to "slow down" the pace of trade with China.

    美国副国务卿小胡佛在日本活动
    要日本放慢对中国进行贸易的步伐
    新华社六日讯　东京消息：现在正在远东进行所谓“访问”的美国副国务卿小胡佛和国际合作署署长霍利斯特已经在六日离开了他们的行程中所到的第一个国家——日本前往南朝鲜活动。
    据美国国务院宣布，小胡佛和霍利斯特这次到远东的目的之一是要“直接视察这个地区的美国援助计划的执行情况”。他们曾在五日同日本首相鸠山一郎、外务相重光葵等日本政府和民主党首脑举行了会谈，讨论日本重新武装问题和与此直接有关的日本参加美国“援助”东南亚的侵略计划问题。小胡佛在会谈中向鸠山一郎表示，美国希望日本经济“迅速复兴”，“在亚洲确保领导者的地位”。据国际新闻社透露，这意味着美国要使日本能“加强其他亚洲自由国家以符合美国的长期防务目标”。这就是说美国要使日本成为美国侵略集团在亚洲的供应基地。
    在会谈中，美国方面以将用来“开发”东南亚地区的总统基金一亿美元为诱饵，要日本在这方面“发挥巨大作用”。霍利斯特并且对鸠山一郎说，应该把美国资本输入日本以“帮助”日本的工业。按照霍利斯特的逻辑，“这将是援助东南亚的另一个方法”。鸠山一郎表示，“日本方面是愿意吸收（美国）技术和资本的”。
    同时，日本方面在会谈中曾经要求美国政府放宽迫使日本实行的对中国的“禁运”限制。但是，小胡佛在六日离开东京之前，在记者招待会上正式否认日本报纸所传他曾同意放宽“禁运”的消息。他说：“美国政策反对改变对于这种贸易的现行的国际管制”。据法新社说，小胡佛等甚至还警告日本要“放慢”对中国进行贸易的步伐。
