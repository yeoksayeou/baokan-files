Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, October 10th. Fushun Coal Mine's coal production this year will reach more than 90% of the production capacity target set for 1957 in the First Five-Year Plan, and next year it will exceed the 1957 production capacity target by more than 5%.

During the period of Japanese and puppet rule, the Fushun Open-Pit Mine was irrationally mined, and the collapsed rocks divided the open-pit mine into two halves, pressing down on more than 5 million tons of coal. Over the past few years, the workers of the open-pit mine have moved the collapsed rocks away from the mining area, reconnecting the open-pit mine into one piece. Now, dozens of huge electric shovels are carrying out coal mining and stripping operations here. In the original Laohutai Mine and Longfeng Mine, which had super-high gas levels, coal miners used to be afraid of causing explosions and did not dare to use even pneumatic machinery that would not cause explosions, using only hand picks to mine coal. Now, due to artificial gas drainage and control of gas hazards, not only are electric picks and coal cutting machines used during coal mining, but combined coal mining machines were also put into use this spring.

In recent years, Fushun Coal Mine has initially changed its past irrational layout. The two vertical shafts of the Shengli Mine, originally built in the open-pit mining area, obstructing the expansion of the open-pit mine, were completely dismantled in July this year. A new inclined shaft began construction last year near the edge of the open-pit mine to replace the Shengli Mine's vertical shafts in mining deep coal seams. Laohutai Mine, which originally had a small coal mining capacity but a large coal transportation capacity, has also expanded many mining areas. Now, a highly mechanized western deep mining area has begun production.

According to the data obtained by the Coalfield Drilling Institute, the coal reserves of the Fushun Mine have increased by 70% compared to the estimates during the period of Japanese and puppet rule.

Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, October 10th. Coal miners at Fushun Coal Mine exceeded the state-stipulated recovery rate target in the third quarter, mining nearly 30,000 tons of additional coal.

In the past, there were often a few inches of loose coal left on the ground after coal was mined, which was buried by sand during filling; now, coal miners have adopted the method of cleaning up while mining, sweeping up several hundred tons of loose coal every day. In the past, coal miners often did not understand the situation of underground coal seams and faults, and sometimes they only relied on estimation to mine, often losing a lot of coal; since June, geological personnel have surveyed the coal seam conditions of each coal area to be mined in advance, and delineated mining lines in the mining area. Coal miners follow the mining lines to mine, so they rarely lose coal anymore.

### 抚顺煤矿产煤量接近五年计划的最高指标

    抚顺煤矿产煤量接近五年计划的最高指标
    新华社抚顺十日电　抚顺煤矿今年产煤量将达到第一个五年计划规定到一九五七年生产能力指标的百分之九十以上，到明年将可超过一九五七年生产能力指标的百分之五以上。
    抚顺露天矿在日伪统治时期由于不合理开采，崩塌下来的岩石把露天矿分隔成两半，压住了五百多万吨煤。几年来，露天矿的职工们把崩塌下来的岩石搬离矿区，使露天矿又连成一片。现在，几十台巨大的电铲在这里进行采煤和剥离工作。在原有超级瓦斯的老虎台矿、龙凤矿里，采煤工人过去怕引起爆炸，连不会引起爆炸的风动机械都不敢使用，只用手镐刨煤。现在由于用人工抽吸瓦斯，控制了瓦斯毒害，采煤时不仅用上电镐和截煤机，今年春天还开始使用了联合采煤机。
    几年来，抚顺煤矿已初步改变了过去的不合理的布局。原来建在露天矿煤田内阻碍着露天矿扩展的胜利矿两对竖井，今年七月已拆除完毕。在靠近露天矿边缘，去年开始动工改建一座新的斜井，代替胜利矿竖井开采深部煤层。原来采煤能力小运煤能力大的老虎台矿，也扩大了很多采区。现在，一个高度机械化的西深部采煤区已开始生产。
    根据煤田钻探所获得的资料，抚顺矿的煤藏量比日伪时期估计的数量增加了百分之七十。
    新华社抚顺十日电　抚顺煤矿采煤工人在第三季度内突破国家规定的回采率指标，多采出了近三万吨煤。
    过去采完煤的场地上往往丢撒有几寸厚的浮煤，充填时让砂埋掉了；现在，采煤工人采取边采煤边清扫的方法，每天清扫出的浮煤有好几百吨。过去采煤工人常常弄不清地下煤层和断层的情况，有时只凭估计来开采，往往丢掉很多煤；六月份以后，地质人员把每个要采的煤区的煤层情况事先勘测清楚，在采区上划出采掘线，采煤工人按照采掘线来开采，就很少再丢煤。
