    Chairman Mao's brilliance illuminates our path forward
    ——Written to celebrate the opening of the Lhasa-Shigatse and Shigatse-Jiangzi Highways
    Bainqen Erdini

    The Lhasa-Shigatse and Shigatse-Jiangzi Highways are now fully open to traffic. This is another great joyous event for the people of Tibet following the opening of the Kangding-Tibet and Qinghai-Tibet Highways to Lhasa; this is a concrete measure of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao's concern for the people of Tibet, opening up a path to happiness for them. The opening of the Lhasa-Shigatse and Shigatse-Jiangzi Highways further strengthens and broadens the connection between Tibet and the motherland, and strengthens the economic, political, and cultural ties within Tibet itself, based on the Kangding-Tibet and Qinghai-Tibet Highways. Therefore, it has an important and active role in strengthening the unity between the Tibetan and Han nationalities and among the people of Tibet. At the same time, the opening of these two highways has also created favorable conditions for the development of production and construction in the Shigatse area. In the past, due to the instigation, alienation and oppression of imperialism and domestic reactionary ruling groups, Tibet was mired in poverty and backwardness for a long time, and there was internal disunity within Tibet. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the close unity and joint efforts of the Dalai Lama and ourselves, these situations are gradually improving, and the central government's vigorous assistance in developing Tibet's transportation has achieved brilliant results. In March of this year, the State Council adopted the decision on establishing the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and assisting the local government of Tibet in construction matters. Under the direct leadership of the State Council, some historical pending cases of the Kashag and the Tsongdu have been basically resolved. These are the sincere wishes of the Tibetan people, and they can only be gradually realized under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Now, Tibet already has four highways. Thanks to the help of the central government, the favorable conditions for building Tibet are constantly increasing. In the future, we must continue to strengthen the unity between the Tibetan and Han nationalities and among the people of Tibet. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, and with the specific assistance of the working personnel and the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, we must vigorously do a good job in the work of establishing the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and strive to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet.

    Since the signing of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, Chairman Mao's brilliance has shone on Tibet, and the Tibetan people have embarked on a path of happiness. Various constructions are developing day by day, and people's lives are gradually improving. The central government has issued a large number of agricultural, pastoral, and handicraft loans in the Tibetan area, vigorously developed medical and health services, and established schools. The working personnel and the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet have conscientiously implemented Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, respecting the people's religious beliefs and customs. The facts of the past few years and our personal experience fully prove that the ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao is entirely for the benefit of the minority nationalities. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, only by uniting in the friendly and cooperative big family of the motherland, can we have today and a happier future. Now, two new highways have opened in Tibet, and construction in other areas is also developing rapidly. The beautiful prospect of Tibet has already been placed before us. We, the people of Tibet, should better shoulder our glorious task and make hundredfold efforts to build our great motherland. Now, as we jubilantly celebrate the opening of the Lhasa-Shigatse and Shigatse-Jiangzi Highways, as we welcome the arrival of happiness, we must continue to follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, unite and progress, work hard to build, and advance towards a socialist society together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country.

    毛主席的光辉照耀着我们前进
    ——为庆祝拉日、日江两条公路通车而作
    班禅额尔德尼
    拉日、日江两条公路已经全线通车了。这是西藏人民继康藏、青藏两条公路通车拉萨后的又一件大喜事；这是中国共产党和毛主席关怀西藏人民的具体措施，给西藏人民开辟了走向幸福的道路。拉日、日江两条公路的通车，在康藏、青藏两条公路的基础上更进一步和更广泛地加强了西藏与祖国内地的联系，加强了西藏内部在经济、政治、文化等方面的联系，因而对加强藏汉民族之间和西藏人民内部团结都有着重要和积极的作用。同时，这两条公路的通车也给发展日喀则地区的生产建设创造了良好条件。过去，由于帝国主义和国内反动统治集团的挑拨离间和歧视压迫，使西藏长期陷于贫穷落后的状态，西藏内部也处于不团结情况下。在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，以及达赖喇嘛和我们的亲密团结和共同努力，这些情况正在逐步改善，中央大力帮助西藏发展交通运输事业已经取得了辉煌的成就。今年三月，国务院通过了关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会和帮助西藏地方进行建设事项的决定，在国务院的直接领导下，基本上解决了噶厦和堪布会议厅的一些历史悬案，这些都是西藏人民的真诚愿望，只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，才能逐步得到实现。现在，西藏已经有了四条公路，由于中央的帮助，建设西藏的有利条件正在不断增加，今后，我们必须继续加强藏汉民族之间和西藏人民内部的团结，在中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，在进藏工作人员和进藏人民解放军的具体帮助下，大力做好成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作，努力建设繁荣幸福的新西藏。
    自从和平解放西藏办法的协议签订以后，毛主席的光辉照到了西藏，西藏人民开始踏上了幸福的道路，各项建设随着一天天地向前发展，人民生活也逐渐得到改善。中央在西藏地区发放了大量的农业、牧业和手工业等贷款，大力发展医疗卫生事业和创办学校等等，进藏工作人员和进藏人民解放军认真执行了毛主席的民族政策，尊重人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯。几年来的事实和我们的亲身体会，充分证明了中国共产党和毛主席的民族政策是完全为了少数民族的利益，我们只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，只有团结在友爱合作的祖国大家庭里，才会有今天，也才会有更加幸福的将来。现在西藏又有两条新的公路通车了，其他方面的建设也日益迅速地向前发展，西藏的美丽远景已经摆在我们面前，我们西藏人民应该更好地担负起我们的光荣任务，百倍努力地来建设我们伟大的祖国。现在，正当我们欢欣鼓舞地来庆祝拉日、日江两条公路通车的时候，正当我们迎接幸福到来的时候，我们要继续遵循毛主席指示的方向，团结进步，努力建设，和全国各族人民一起，向着社会主义社会前进。
