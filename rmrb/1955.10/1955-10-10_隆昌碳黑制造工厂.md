    Longchang Carbon Black Manufacturing Plant
    By Our Correspondent Li Ce
    A new factory utilizing underground natural gas to produce carbon black has been built in Longchang County, Sichuan Province. This is a significant achievement in China's chemical industry construction.
    Carbon black is an indispensable raw material for the rubber industry. When manufacturing tires for automobiles, airplanes, tractors, etc., the addition of carbon black to the rubber increases its resistance to pressure and wear. Carbon black is also an important ingredient in everyday rubber products such as high-grade paints, inks, phonograph records, and rain boots.
    The machinery and equipment of the Longchang Carbon Black Manufacturing Plant were successfully designed by Chinese engineers and technicians through repeated research. Trial results have proven that the design and construction are completely correct. This design fully utilizes China's existing technical conditions. For example, the natural gas injection combustion nozzles need to be made of high-temperature resistant materials. According to design data from capitalist countries, they are made of "soapstone." However, this type of stone cannot be found in southwestern China; even if it were found, processing and manufacturing would be difficult. But the employees of the Yibin Electromagnetic Factory successfully trial-produced it using another high-temperature resistant material. Design data from capitalist countries stated that the walls of the carbon black plant's firebox were made of tinplate. However, under China's existing material conditions, using tinplate is costly and easily conducts heat, making it unbearable for workers to work near the firebox. Therefore, workers and engineers broke with the conventions of capitalist countries and changed to using brick to build the walls of the firebox. This type of wall has a very good effect, is durable, inexpensive, and does not easily conduct heat.
    Carbon black production is an emerging industry in China. Many employees only learned what carbon black was after arriving at the factory. Initially, everyone was producing through exploration. Engineers and technicians personally taught workers the operating methods, successively recruited apprentices, learned and worked at the same time, and gradually expanded the carbon black workers' ranks. The number of fireboxes producing carbon black has now expanded from the initial one to twenty. Simultaneously, carbon black production has also significantly increased year by year. This year, carbon black production will increase by 138.59% compared to last year.
    In order to adapt to the development of carbon black production, the Longchang Carbon Black Manufacturing Plant is conducting large-scale drilling work. Amidst the green hills and forests, tall drilling rigs stand erect; drilling workers are working hard on the site, regardless of storms and heavy rain, preparing conditions for future expansion of production.

    隆昌碳黑制造工厂

    在四川隆昌县境内，新建了一座利用地下天然气制造碳黑的工厂。这是我国化学工业建设上一项重大的成就。
    碳黑是橡胶工业不可缺少的原料。制造汽车、飞机、拖拉机等所用的轮胎时，在橡胶内渗入碳黑，才能够增加抗压和耐磨的力量。在日常用的橡胶制品中，如高级油漆、油墨、留声机的唱片、以及雨鞋等，碳黑也是重要的成份。
    隆昌碳黑制造工厂的机器设备，是我国工程技术人员经过反复钻研设计成功的，试制结果证明，设计和施工是完全正确的。这个设计充分利用了我国现有的技术条件。如天然气喷射燃烧的火嘴，要用耐高温的材料制造。根据资本主义国家的设计资料是用“泡皂石”制成的。但在我国西南地区，找不到这种石料；就是找到了，加工制造也困难。但是宜宾电磁厂的职工们利用另外一种耐高温的材料，把它试制成功了。资本主义国家的设计资料说：碳黑厂火房的墙壁是用白铁皮做的。但是，在我国现有的物质条件下，用白铁皮成本高，同时容易传热，工人在火房跟前工作烤得受不住。于是，工人和工程技术人员们就打破了资本主义国家的惯例，改用砖砌火房的墙壁。这种墙的效果很好，经久耐用，价钱便宜，也不容易传热。
    碳黑生产是我国新兴的工业。很多职工都是走到厂内才知道什么是碳黑的。开始大家在摸索中进行生产。工程技术人员亲自教授工人操作方法，陆续招收学徒，边学边做，逐渐扩大了碳黑工人的队伍。生产碳黑的火房，现在也由最初的一个扩建到二十个。和这同时，碳黑生产也年年都有显著的提高。今年，碳黑的生产将比去年增加百分之一百三十八点五九。
    为了适应碳黑生产的发展，隆昌碳黑制造工厂正进行大规模的钻探工作。在青绿的山林间，高大的钻井机矗立起来了；钻探工人们不管狂风暴雨，在机场上紧张地工作着，为将来扩大生产准备条件。（附图片）
