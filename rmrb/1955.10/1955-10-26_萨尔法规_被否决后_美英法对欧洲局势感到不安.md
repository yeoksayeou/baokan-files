Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 25th: The European situation caused by the rejection of the "Saar Statute" has made the United States, Britain, and France feel uneasy.

The foreign ministers of the seven "Western European Union" countries met in Paris on the 24th for an informal discussion of the situation after the "Saar Statute" was rejected. Reuters reporter Priddle said that this rejection "caused painful disappointment to the Western diplomats who gathered in Paris to negotiate before the Geneva 'Big Four' conference." Priddle also pointed out: "Many prominent figures apparently harbor doubts as to whether the Saar can fully return to the situation before the referendum, while France firmly believes that this is the legitimate state of affairs once the statute is rejected."

According to a United Press report, the US State Department refused to comment on the rejection of the "Saar Statute," but US officials in private conversations expressed concern that the outcome of the vote would "renew the tension between Germany and France," which would "severely weaken" the "unity" of Western countries on the eve of the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference. A Reuters report also said: Washington officials believe that "the Saar people's rejection of the 'European Statute' is considered a possible serious setback to the United States' ten-year effort to promote a unified Europe." The Reuters report also said: This vote "is also a setback for other relevant pillars of the United States' European policy... and it is also an indirect setback for including a rearmed Germany in a unified Europe."

A British Foreign Office spokesman also declined to make an official comment on the rejection of the "Saar Statute." However, a Reuters report said: British officials are "deeply concerned," and London diplomatic circles worry that this "may cause new Franco-German friction at a crucial juncture in Western European affairs." Stead, a reporter for the British "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post," wrote: "The rejection of the statute has created a turbulent and chaotic situation not only in the Saar itself but also in the broader aspect of Franco-German relations. It will also have a broader impact on Western unity and coordination. The European integration plan has also suffered a serious setback. The Saar was originally intended to be the first territorial core to implement this proposition."

Paris newspapers believe that the vote on the "Saar Statute" was a failure of French foreign policy and a blow to the Western European military alliance, because the Saar Europeanization Statute was one of the conditions for France to agree to ratify the Paris Agreement. An Agence France-Presse commentator wrote: "The impact of the vote is enormous... the hopes placed on the ratification of the Saar Statute have been dashed."

According to reports from Bonn, West German politicians welcomed the results of the Saar referendum. The West German government held an emergency meeting on the 24th. In a communique issued after the meeting, the West German government demanded that "new solutions" be sought for the Saar issue, that is, it demanded that international negotiations on the Saar issue be reopened.

### “萨尔法规”被否决后  美英法对欧洲局势感到不安

    “萨尔法规”被否决后
    美英法对欧洲局势感到不安
    新华社柏林二十五日电　由于“萨尔法规”被否决而引起的欧洲局势使美国、英国和法国感到不安。
    “西欧联盟”七国外长二十四日在巴黎开会，对“萨尔法规”被否决后的局势作非正式的讨论。路透社记者普里德尔说，这次否决“使得在巴黎聚会以便在日内瓦‘四大国’会议之前进行谈判的西方外交家感到痛苦的失望”。普里德尔同时指出：“许多显要人物对萨尔是否能完全回复到在公民投票前的局面显然抱着怀疑，而法国则坚决认为这是法规一旦被否决后的合法状况。”
    据合众社消息，美国国务院对“萨尔法规”被否决拒绝评论，但是美国官方人士在私人谈话里表示耽心，这次投票的结果会“重新使德、法两国之间的关系紧张起来”，这样“就会严重地削弱”西方国家在日内瓦外长会议前夕的“团结”。路透社的消息也说：华盛顿官方人士认为：“萨尔人的拒绝‘欧洲法规’，对于美国为了促成一个统一的欧洲而进行的十年努力，被认为是一个可能的严重挫折”。路透社消息还说：这次投票“对于美国的欧洲政策的其他有关支柱，也是一个挫折……而且，对于在统一的欧洲中包括一个重新武装的德国这件事，也是一个间接挫折”。
    英国外交部发言人也拒绝对“萨尔法规”被否决这件事发表官方评论。但是路透社消息说：英国官员“深感忧虑”，伦敦外交界人士担心这“可能在西欧事务中的紧要关头引起新的法德摩擦”。英国“每日电讯与晨邮报”记者史梯德写道：“法规的遭到拒绝不但在萨尔本身而且在法德关系这个广泛的方面造成了一种动荡而混乱的局势。它对西方的团结和协调也将产生更加广泛的影响。欧洲整体化计划也遭到了严重的挫折，萨尔原来是要被当作第一个实行这种主张的领土核心。”
    巴黎报纸认为对“萨尔法规”的投票是法国外交政策的一次失败，而且是对西欧军事联盟的一个打击，因为萨尔欧洲化法规是法国同意批准巴黎协定的条件之一。法新社评论员写道：“投票的影响是巨大的……对批准萨尔法规所寄托的希望已经落空了。”
    据波恩消息，西德政界人士欢迎萨尔公民投票的结果。西德政府二十四日举行了紧急会议，在会后发表的公报中，西德政府要求就萨尔问题“谋求新的解决办法”，也就是要求就萨尔问题重新举行国际谈判。
