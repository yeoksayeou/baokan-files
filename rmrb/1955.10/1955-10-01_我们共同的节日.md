    Our Common Festival
    Soviet People's Artist Ulanova
    I call the National Day of the People's Republic of China our common festival, because the day the new China was established, the day the Chinese people overcame the dark forces of war and oppression, the day the people's regime was declared in a country with ancient culture, art, and science, makes everyone who cherishes the principles of humanism and the achievements of civilization feel excited. Not only in the Soviet Union, but in every corner of the earth, on all continents, millions of people are widely celebrating the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, because the joy of the Chinese people is also the joy of so many people on this planet.
    Undoubtedly, on this day, those of us who have been fortunate enough to visit China will particularly clearly recall everything we saw in this strong, hardworking, and beautiful country. In my mind, it seems as if today's festive Beijing appears, with its magnificent palaces—the meticulous work of ancient artisans, the colorful lights, and the bright stars in the night sky. I seem to see the hot, sun-drenched Guangzhou, the smiles of the people of Guangzhou, and the flowers in Guangzhou's lush gardens. I seem to hear the never-ending clamor of Shanghai—the music peculiar to this great city… Today, I clearly remember and gratefully recite the names of those people—the names of those simple laborers in the fields and factories, the names of the amazing masters of outstanding stage art, the names of Mei Lanfang's young students, whose fortunate fate allowed me to meet them in China. I imagine their joy now, and I want to tell them all: I share your joy!
    What makes me happy is not only this festival but also all the achievements that the new China has made in various fields of life in these years: from the unprecedented increase in coal production in the Fushun coal mine to the production victories of the thousands upon thousands of workers in the various branches and mines of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, a Chinese metallurgical factory. I am delighted to learn about the achievements of those who grow tea on the fertile tea plantations near Hangzhou, those who weave magical, colorful silks in the Hangzhou factories, and those who make light and elegant fans in small handicraft workshops…
    Needless to say, what makes me particularly happy is the achievements of Chinese art. The many centuries of tradition in Chinese art, its unparalleled uniqueness, have long brought international honor to Chinese drama and painting, pottery and embroidery, casting and sculpture. The Soviet people themselves are tireless explorers, but the scale of experience and the exploration of new forms and new content in the art of the People's China cannot but impress the Soviet people. I sincerely hope that Chinese art workers will achieve various successes in this difficult and noble work, and I am convinced that great creative achievements await them.
    I believe that whether it is the excellent works of the Second National Art Exhibition of China, or the establishment of the Central Experimental Opera House in Beijing, which has already staged operas like "Prairie Song," and the establishment of the Capital Dance School... are all proofs of the flourishing development of art in the new China.
    I learned about the dance school from comrades of the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre, who had visited China for performances. It must be admitted that the achievements of this school, which has only been established for a year, are amazing. While still in China, I had personally witnessed the rare sensitivity and sense of melody peculiar to the Chinese people. But I never imagined that after studying with Soviet ballet teachers for only two months, the students of this dance school would be able to understand the principles of classical ballet art so well and be able to participate in the performance of such a complex opera as our immortal musician Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake"... I can only regret that I cannot applaud together with the audience in the Beijing Theater on this memorable evening, in this theater where Soviet dancers have performed, and where Chinese children also performed dances with them. This creative cooperation between the actors of the two countries in the performance of ballet is also a vivid symbol of the friendship and intimacy between the two peoples!
    Isn't the performance of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya" by the China Youth Art Theatre, and the beautiful recitation of Agafya's monologue from Gogol's comedy "Marriage" at the evening party held at the Beijing Actors' Home, proof of our spiritual closeness and the consolidation of the connection between our thoughts? Of course, it is.
    It is by no means accidental that Soviet authors' books about China published in Moscow sell so quickly in our bookstores. Millions of Soviet people are reading Fedin's "An Outline of Modern Chinese Literature" and Yutkevich's "Drama and Film in Free China," Shneerson's "Chinese Music" and Obraztsov's "Five Thousand Years and Three Years." Millions of my compatriots are enthusiastically reading every Chinese dispatch, every feature article about China, and every telegram from Beijing published in newspapers and broadcast on the radio... This is how we know all the political and cultural news of your country, and when I know any of this news, whether it is a message about the new achievements in collective farming or a description of the grand occasion at the "Tianqiao" Theater when celebrating the 50th anniversary of the stage life of the oldest Chinese actors Mei Lanfang and Zhou Xinfang, my praise is consistent with the praise of those who warmly, sincerely, and concernedly welcome all the best things happening in China today.
    Speaking of the People's China and its artistic achievements, there is one more thing that cannot but be praised: this art has stepped onto the international stage.
    I am referring to the success of Beijing's "The Legend of the White Snake" in Paris, the cheers of the audience at the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre and the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, who were captivated by the unique elegance, purity, and magnificence of this performance. I cannot forget this play either, even though I saw it in China a few years ago. I understand the brilliant achievements of "The Legend of the White Snake" in the crowded halls of Geneva, Basel, and Zurich. I understand that Londoners are eagerly looking forward to seeing this rare, fairytale-like, beautiful drama, and I am happy that the world knows the art of our friends. I believe this is a reliable sign of the closeness of peoples from all countries.
    I sincerely thank those Chinese friends who have made the Soviet people understand the excellent skills of Yue Opera.
    Whenever I see the actors of Yue Opera's "The Butterfly Lovers" and other dramas, I always repeatedly praise the beauty of the plot, the skills and re-embodiment ability of the actors, and the amazing musicality of the movements and gestures.
    I believe that these achievements of Chinese art and many other achievements, all the achievements of my Chinese comrades in creative work, are related to the solemn and joyful day of the birth of the People's Republic of China. This connection is organic and inseparable: the freedom gained in the years of arduous struggle has brought its beautiful fruits to all fields of people's lives.
    What touches and delights me most as a Soviet ballet dancer is that the achievements and new gains of Chinese drama, the glorious tradition of Chinese drama, are not only the achievements of the Chinese people but also the achievements of the people of other countries in the world.
    On this great National Day of Chinese friends, I sincerely wish my Chinese friends further achievements and new victories, and hope that the friendship between the people of our two countries and the people of all countries in the world will be increasingly consolidated!

    我们共同的节日
    苏联人民演员  乌兰诺娃
    我把中华人民共和国的国庆日叫做我们共同的节日，因为新中国建立的这一天，中国人民战胜战争和压迫的黑暗势力的这一天，在拥有古老的文化、艺术和科学的国家里宣布人民政权成立的这一天，使一切珍视人道主义原则和文明成果的人都感到兴奋。不仅在苏联，而且在地球上的各个角落，在所有的大陆上，千百万人们都在广泛地庆祝中华人民共和国成立六周年，因为中国人民的愉快也是我们这个星球上许许多多人的愉快。
    无疑地，在这一天，我们中间那些幸运地亲自到过中国的人，都特别清楚地回想起在这个强大的、勤劳的、美丽的国家里所看到的一切。在我的眼前好像是出现了今天节日的北京和它那宏伟的宫殿——古代人民匠师的精心作品，五颜六色的灯火和夜空上的明亮的星星，我好像是看见炎热的、浴在阳光中的广州，广州人的微笑，广州的绿荫如盖的花园里的花朵，我好像又听见上海的永不停止的喧哗——这个大城市所特有的音乐……今天我清楚地记得并且怀着感激的心情来念着那些人的名字——那些在田间和工厂里的朴实的劳动者的名字、那些出色的舞台艺术的惊人的大师的名字、那些梅兰芳的小学生的名字，幸福的命运使我在中国同他们相识了。我想像着他们现在的愉快，我愿意告诉他们大家说：我在同你们一道感到欢乐！
    使我感到高兴的不只是这个节日，还有在这些年中新中国各个生活领域内所获得的一切成绩：从抚顺煤矿采煤量的空前未有的提高到中国冶金工厂——鞍山钢铁公司各个分厂和矿井的成千上万的工人们在生产上的胜利。我愉快地得知那些在杭州附近的肥沃的茶场上种茶的人，在杭州工厂纺织神奇变幻的、五光十色的绸缎的人和在小手工业作坊制作轻巧而雅致的扇子的人们的成就……
    不言而喻，使我感到特别高兴的是中国艺术的成就。中国艺术的许多世纪来的传统，它那无与伦比的独特性早已给中国的戏剧和绘画、陶器和刺绣、铸造和雕刻带来了国际荣誉。苏联人本身就是不知疲倦的探索者，但是，在人民中国的艺术中，经验和对新形式和新内容的探索的巨大规模，也不能不使苏联人感到钦佩。我衷心地希望中国艺术工作者在这种艰难而崇高的工作中获得各种成就，我深信，巨大的创造性的成就在等待着他们。
    我认为，无论中国第二届全国美术展览会的优秀作品，无论北京已经上演了像“草原之歌”这样的歌剧的中央实验歌剧院的成立以及首都舞蹈学校的成立……都是新中国艺术蓬勃发展的证明。
    我从曾在中国作了访问演出的斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇—丹钦科剧院的同志们那里知道了舞蹈学校的情况，应当承认，才成立一年的这个学校的成绩是惊人的。还在中国的时候，我就曾亲眼看到中国人所特有的那种罕有的感受力和旋律感。但是我从来都没有设想过，在向苏联巴蕾舞教师学了两个月以后，这个舞蹈学校的学生已能够那么好地领会了古典的巴蕾舞艺术的原则，并能够参加像我们的永垂不朽的音乐家柴可夫斯基的“天鹅湖”那样复杂的歌剧的演出……我只能惋惜，我不能在这个值得纪念的晚上和北京剧院的观众一同鼓掌，在这个剧院里，苏联的舞蹈家曾演出过，同他们一同表演舞蹈的还有中国的儿童们。两国人民的演员在巴蕾舞的演出上的这种创造性的合作，也是两国人民友爱和亲密的生动的象征！
    中国青年艺术剧院上演的契诃夫的“万尼亚舅舅”，在北京演员之家举行的晚会上优美地朗诵的果戈里的喜剧“婚事”里的阿茄菲亚的独白，难道不是证明我们精神上的接近，我们思想上的联系的巩固吗？当然是的。
    在莫斯科出版的苏联作者写的有关中国的书在我们的书店里销得那么快，这绝不是偶然的。千百万的苏联人都在阅读费德林的“现代中国文学概论”和尤特凯维奇的“自由的中国的戏剧和电影”，施涅耶尔松的“中国的音乐”和奥布拉兹卓夫的“五千年和三年”。我的千百万的同胞在热心地读着报刊上刊登的和广播电台上广播的每一篇中国通讯、每一篇关于中国的特写和从北京发来的每条电讯……我们就这样知道了你们国家的一切政治和文化的新闻，并且当我知道这些新闻中的任何一条的时候，即便是关于集体耕种土地的新成就的消息或是当纪念最老的中国演员梅兰芳和周信芳的舞台生活五十年时“天桥”剧场盛况的描写也好，我的赞扬是和那些热烈地、真挚地、关切地欢迎今天中国所发生的一切最好的事物的人们的赞扬一致的。
    谈到人民中国和它的艺术上的成就，还有一点不能不令人赞扬的：这种艺术已步上了国际舞台。
    我指的是关于北京的“白蛇传”在巴黎上演的成功，关于被这次演出的特有的优雅、纯洁和华丽所迷惑的萨拉·伯纳特剧院和夏乐宫的观众的欢腾，我也不能够忘记这出戏，尽管我在中国看到这出戏已经是几年以前的事了。我了解“白蛇传”在日内瓦、巴塞尔和苏黎世的挤满了人的大厅里所获得的辉煌成绩，我明白伦敦人贪婪地想望着看到这个罕有的、童话般美丽的戏剧，而且我因为全世界知道我们朋友的艺术而感到高兴，我认为这是各国人民接近的可靠的标志。
    我衷心地感谢那些使苏联人了解越剧的卓越的技巧的中国朋友们。
    当我一看到越剧“梁山伯与祝英台”和其他戏剧的演员时，我总是一再地赞扬情节的美妙、演员的技巧和再体现的能力、动作和手势的惊人的音乐性。
    我认为，中国艺术的这些成就和其他许多成就，我的中国同志们在创作工作方面的一切成就，都是同中华人民共和国诞生的隆重的和愉快的日子联系在一起的。这种联系是有机的和不可分割的：在严酷斗争的年月里获得的自由给人民生活各个领域都带来了它的美丽的果实。
    使作为一个苏联巴蕾舞演员的我最感动的和愉快的是：中国戏剧的成就和新收获，中国戏剧的光荣传统不只是中国人民的成就，而且也是世界其他各国人民的成就。
    在中国朋友的伟大的国庆日这一天，我衷心地希望我的中国朋友们获得进一步的成就和新的胜利，希望我们两国人民和全世界各国人民之间的友谊日益巩固！
