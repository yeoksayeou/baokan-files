    "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!"
    Contents of the 40th Issue of the Chinese Edition
    The 40th issue of the Chinese edition of the Cominform organ "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" has been published.
    To celebrate the 6th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, this issue published an editorial entitled "The First Worker-Peasant State in German History." The editorial pointed out: The founding of the German Democratic Republic opened a new historical era for Germany; after years of struggle, the German people finally found the true path to democracy and freedom, and the true path to peace and friendly cooperation with the people of other countries. In the German Democratic Republic, the talented and hardworking great German people have firmly embarked on the road of systematically laying the foundation for socialism. Its economic and political achievements powerfully attract the working people of West Germany, who regard it as a reliable fortress for striving to establish a unified, independent, and democratic Germany. However, some Western figures stubbornly ignore reality and attempt to re-adopt the bankrupt "position of strength" policy to solve the German problem. However, the democratic forces in Germany firmly oppose this policy. The Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp are vigorously helping the German people strive for the reunification of the country on a peaceful and democratic basis. On the 6th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, all fighters who resolutely fight for peace and the easing of international tensions sincerely wish its people new victories in the struggle to build a free, peaceful, and democratic new Germany, and in the struggle for peace and security.
    This issue carries an article by Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic and member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, entitled "Under the Banner of National Freedom and National Independence," as well as speeches by Grotewohl and Suslov at the celebration meeting for the 6th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic held in Berlin.
    This issue also contains an article by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, entitled "The Significance of the Relaxation of International Tensions." This article is an excerpt from Togliatti's speech at the Italian National Celebration of "L'Unità" Congress in September this year. The article emphasizes: We must not forget that a conscious force has paved the way for the changes in the current international situation. This force is the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China and the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe. The changes in the international situation actually show that people generally recognize that socialism has gained a firm foothold in the world and is developing. The relaxation of international tensions is closely related to the situation in various countries, especially Italy. In international relations, the relaxation of tensions means the end of the "Cold War." In all countries, including Italy, the "Cold War" should also end. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版第四十期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第四十期中文版已经出版。
    为庆祝德意志民主共和国成立六周年，这一期发表了题为“德国历史上的第一个工农国家”的社论。社论指出：德意志民主共和国的成立给德国开辟了一个新的历史时代；德国人民经过多年的斗争终于找到了民主和自由的真正道路，找到了和平和同其他国家人民友好合作的真正道路。在德意志民主共和国，富有才能而勤劳的伟大的德国人民已经坚定地走上了有计划奠定社会主义基础的道路。它的经济和政治成就强有力地吸引着西德劳动人民，他们把它当作争取建立一个统一、独立的民主德国的可靠堡垒。但是，某些西方人士仍旧顽固地无视现实，企图重新采用破了产的“实力地位”政策来解决德国问题。然而，德国民主力量坚决反对这种政策。苏联和社会主义阵营其他各国都在大力帮助德国人民争取在和平民主基础上恢复国家的统一。在德意志民主共和国成立六周年的时候，所有坚决为和平和缓和国际紧张局势而奋斗的战士都衷心地祝它的人民在建立一个自由、和平和民主的新德国的斗争中，在争取和平与安全的斗争中，获得新的胜利。
    这一期刊载了德意志民主共和国总统、德国统一社会党中央政治局委员皮克的文章“在民族自由和国家独立的旗帜下”、格罗提渥和苏斯洛夫在柏林举行的德意志民主共和国成立六周年庆祝大会上的讲话。
    这一期还刊载了意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂的文章“国际紧张局势缓和的意义”。这篇文章是陶里亚蒂今年九月间在意大利全国庆祝“团结报”大会上的演说摘要。文章着重指出：我们不能忘记有一支自觉的力量为当前国际形势发生的变化铺平了道路。这支力量就是伟大的社会主义国家苏联，就是中华人民共和国和东欧人民民主国家。国际形势发生的变化实际上说明人们公认社会主义在世界已经站稳脚跟并且正在发展。国际紧张局势的缓和是同各个国家特别是意大利的形势有密切联系的。在国际关系上，紧张局势的缓和就意味着结束“冷战”。在各个国家里、在意大利也应当结束“冷战”。　（新华社）
