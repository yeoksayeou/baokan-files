    Newly Built State-Owned Baotou Sugar Factory
    By Our Correspondent Liu Heng
    A Mechanized Factory
    The newly built state-owned Baotou Sugar Factory began trial operation on this year's National Day and will soon be officially put into production. This is a highly mechanized and semi-automatic factory. Walking into the workshop, you see few people; all you see around, above, and below are machines, including those that automatically add coal, add water, discharge ash, send steam, remove stones, remove grass, and wash sugar beets. Bucket elevators lift the sugar beets high into the air, and automatic scales drop them into deep holes. Vibrating screens shake off the water from the sugar beets, and slicing machines chop them into shreds. The sugar juice seeping out of the vats travels through countless vats and pipes of all sizes, undergoing ash addition, sulfur fumigation, carbonation saturation, and evaporation, finally turning into snow-white crystalline granules—sugar. Then, the machines automatically weigh the sugar, automatically sort it into grades, automatically package it, and automatically stack it for storage.
    People's eyes cannot see inside the machines, but the machines themselves can see, because many machines have eyes—instruments. Whether the steam is too high or too low, whether the carbonic acid is too much or too little, whether the water level is high or low, whether the wind force is strong or weak, whether the sugar juice is thick or thin, the instruments record them on paper in red, yellow, blue, green, and purple colors, respectively, to attract attention.
    The transmission parts of the machines are equipped with protective covers; the machines can only run when the protective covers are in place. Many machines also have interlocking devices—if the machine at the back stops, the machine at the front cannot start; if the machine at the front does not stop, the machine at the back cannot stop. Each sugar juice storage vat has an overflow pipe, so that the sugar juice can only flow to a certain height and will not overflow. If the steam in the boiler is too high, the safety valve will give a loud cry and automatically release the steam. If the load on the generator is too heavy, the gate will drop and automatically cut off the power, preventing dangerous accidents.
    The Crystallization of Friendship Between the Chinese and German People
    The Baotou Sugar Factory is the crystallization of friendship between the Chinese and German people. The set of exquisite and complex machines mentioned above was manufactured by the German Democratic Republic based on the most advanced sugar-making experience. The German Democratic Republic also sent experienced experts to our country. In October 1953, sugar machinery experts Wolf and Kreysima began to help China design the sugar factory, and in April 1954, they came to the sugar factory again. Later arrivals included boiler expert Müller-Holz, electrical expert Qiumuski, turbine expert Frick-Ulbricht, welding expert Kohler, instrument expert Xiao Yiman, and sugar-making expert Rabowski.
    For the past two years, from design to construction, from installing machines to starting production, the experts have been conducting detailed research, providing patient guidance, and teaching by hand. Whether they arrived early or late, they were always eager to change their clothes and go to the site immediately after getting off the train. They said: The Baotou Sugar Factory is a friend I haven't met, I've been missing it for a long time, and I want to go see it quickly. They lay on the ground to check whether the screws on the machines were tightened, and crawled into the dirty, dark, and stuffy boilers to see if each pipe was installed properly. They personally installed, personally welded, and showed the workers how to do it. Kreysima said to the workers: "We all have the same fingers, what you can do, I can do too. Our government sent us here, we not only use our mouths, but also our hands." During the intense period of the project, the experts ate in the workshop and worked continuously for more than ten hours a day. Qiumuski spent half a month checking the high and low voltage electrical switches, going early and returning late every day. After a few days, his face turned yellow and he couldn't eat. They told him not to go, but they couldn't persuade him. After the trial operation started, the experts stayed by the machines and refused to leave; eight experts didn't sleep all night and worked until seven o'clock the next morning.
    After China launched the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the experts studied with technicians and workers to change some of the designs. Without affecting the quality of the project, they changed the concrete foundation of the sewer to installing cement pipes on the spot, changed the original design of the sugar collecting hopper from tiling to laying wooden boards, and also reduced some pipelines and enamel plates, saving a lot of funds. Sometimes some workers were careless and ran around on the newly laid cement floor. When Comrade Müller saw this, he immediately pulled him aside. When Wolf saw workers throwing welding heads on the ground, he suggested to the factory: "China is a large country, as long as everyone saves and is careful everywhere, it will be a large sum of money, and the country can accelerate industrialization." The experts also told the workers to carry cotton yarn with them and often wipe the machines. Rabowski often said: "The workshop should be as clean as a hospital. Otherwise, the machines will get sick. Keeping the machines well maintained can extend their service life, which is the biggest saving."
    In the past two years, according to incomplete statistics, the experts have made a total of 784 written suggestions and important verbal suggestions. These suggestions have played a decisive role in accelerating the progress of the project, ensuring the quality of the project, and saving funds. Starting in March this year, the experts also compiled lecture notes and gave 66 lectures to all employees, teaching the operating methods and theories of various machines. According to the test scores of the fixed workers in the sugar-making workshop, more than 90% scored three points or more—this is an important condition for the Baotou Sugar Factory to be put into production on schedule.
    The Sugar Factory is for Everyone, Everyone is for the Sugar Factory
    The construction of the Baotou Sugar Factory is to further meet the people's needs for sugar, increase socialist accumulation, and promote the country's socialist industrialization; it specifically embodies the country's policy in the transition period: while concentrating major efforts on developing heavy industry, it correspondingly develops light industry and other economic undertakings. The thousands upon thousands of tons of sugar produced by the Baotou Sugar Factory every year will be supplied to Inner Mongolia and North China. The by-products alcohol, fusel oil, etc. are raw materials needed by industry. Sugar beet pulp contains protein, sugar, and fat, which is a good feed for livestock. Therefore, the establishment of the Baotou Sugar Factory will not only further meet people's needs for sugar, but also promote the development of animal husbandry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    The area where the sugar factory is located has good soil quality, little rainfall, plenty of sunshine, and a large temperature difference between day and night. There is a saying: "Wear a fur coat in the morning, wear gauze at noon, and eat watermelon while holding a stove." This, like the saying "dryland melons are sweet," is suitable for sugar beets to accumulate sugar. The sugar content of sugar beets here is the highest in China, generally between 16% and 20%, and some reach 22%. After the sugar factory started construction in May 1954, many farmer representatives came to visit and learn from it. After returning, they promoted it while walking and also while sitting, calling on everyone to grow more sugar beets and support national industrial construction. In 1955, 110,000 mu of sugar beets were planted along the Beijing-Baotou Railway in Inner Mongolia. Because the land for these sugar beets was good, a lot of fertilizer was applied, and thinning, transplanting, weeding, and pest control were carried out in a timely manner, the general yield was more than 3,000 jin per mu, and some even reached more than 10,000 jin. In this golden harvest season, farmers have begun to pull livestock and drive carts to send sugar beets to the purchasing stations. Farmers have also increased their income by supporting sugar factory production. Therefore, the establishment of the Baotou Sugar Factory will also stimulate the development of agriculture in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    During the construction of the Baotou Sugar Factory, it received enthusiastic support from the broad masses of people across the country. Jilin, Harbin, Shenyang, Jinan, Guangdong, Beijing Shijingshan and other places helped the sugar factory train more than 300 technical workers in sugar-making, machinery, and electrical engineering. The buildings of the sugar factory have seamless steel pipes from Anshan Iron and Steel, timber from Jiangxi, steel from Tianjin, fire-resistant bricks from Tangshan, and cement from Liulihe. Construction workers from Beijing, electromechanical workers from Shenyang, and railway workers from Taiyuan have all come to participate in the construction. They laid bricks, poured concrete, some drilled into the ground more than ten meters deep to distinguish the nature of the strata; some climbed to a height of more than forty meters to erect cranes. More than 400 machine installation workers from Guangdong had never seen snowflakes. Before coming to Baotou, the whole group held a mobilization meeting to "not be afraid of the cold." After arriving in Baotou, in winter, no matter how heavy the wind and snow in the border area were, they all gritted their teeth and persevered happily. Moreover, among them, there emerged two labor models, one advanced worker, and thirty advanced producers. They also put forward many rationalization proposals. One famous rationalization proposal was: when installing the high and large metal kiln body of the lime kiln, they changed the design of sectional welding and sectional hoisting, and adopted the method of welding on the spot and hoisting at one time, avoiding high-altitude operations, completing the project more than twenty days in advance, and saving the country more than 8,000 yuan. These machine installation workers, like all other workers, quickly improved themselves in the construction of supporting the sugar factory. Originally, they had never seen new-style sugar-making machines. Now, without experts on-site to guide them, they are already able to independently install new-style Czechoslovakian machines in a sugar factory in Guangxi.
    During the trial operation, the employees of the Baotou Sugar Factory have already written a guarantee: to supply more white and sweet "Prairie Brand" sugar to the people of the whole country. (Attached picture)

    新建成的国营包头糖厂
    本报记者　刘衡
    一座机械化的工厂
    新建的国营包头糖厂已经在今年国庆日开始试运转，不久就可以正式投入生产。这是一座高度机械化、半自动化的工厂。走进车间，看不见几个人，前后左右上下看见的全是机器，其中有自动添煤的，加水的，卸灰的，送汽的，除石头的，除草的，洗甜菜的。斗升机把甜菜高高地举到空中，自动磅秤又把它丢进深深的大洞。震送筛抖掉甜菜身上的水，切丝机又把它一刀刀切碎。渗出缶渗出的糖水在大大小小、粗粗细细的数不清的缶子、管子里头穿来钻去，经过加灰、硫熏、炭酸饱和、蒸发，最后变成了雪白的结晶小粒——砂糖。然后机器又自动称糖，自动分等，自动包装，自动堆积储藏。
    人们的眼睛看不到机器里头去，可是机器自己却看得见，因为许多机器上面都有眼睛——仪表。蒸汽大了小了，炭酸多了少了，水位高了低了，风力强了弱了，糖水浓了淡了，仪表就分别用红黄蓝绿紫等颜色写在纸上，叫人注意。
    机器的传动部分都装置着保护罩，把保护罩罩好，机器才能转动。许多机器还有连锁装置——后边的机器停了，前边的机器就开不动；前边的机器没有停，后边的机器就停不下来。每个贮糖汁缶都有溢流管，使糖水只能流到一定高度，漫不出来。如果锅炉的蒸汽太大，安全阀就会大叫一声，自动把蒸汽放走。如果发电机的负荷太重，闸门就会掉下来，自动停电，不会发生危险事故。
    中、德人民友谊的结晶
    包头糖厂是中、德人民友谊的结晶。原来上面说的那一套精巧复杂的机器是德意志民主共和国根据近代最先进的制糖经验制造出来的。德意志民主共和国还给我国派来了富有经验的专家。一九五三年十月，制糖机械专家沃尔夫和克雷西马就开始帮助我国进行糖厂设计，一九五四年四月又来到糖厂。以后陆续来的还有锅炉专家缪勒·霍尔彩，电气专家邱木斯基，透平专家弗立克·乌利必希，焊接专家寇勒，仪表专家萧一曼，制糖专家拉包夫斯基。
    两年来，从设计到施工，从安装机器到开工生产，专家都是详细研究，耐心指导，把着手教。他们不管是先来的还是后来的，总是一下火车，就急着换衣服上现场。他们说：包头糖厂是我没见过面的朋友，我想念好久了，要赶快去看一看。他们伏在地上检查机器的螺丝上得紧不紧，钻进又脏又黑又闷的锅炉里面，看看每根管子安得好不好。他们亲自安装，亲自焊接，做出样子给工人看。克雷西马对工人说：“我们大家都是一样的手指头，你们能做，我也能做。我国政府派我们来，我们不光动嘴，还要动手。”在工程紧张的时候，专家就在车间吃饭，每天接连工作十多个钟头。邱木斯基用半月时间检查电气高低压开关，每天早早就去，半夜才回。几天后，脸黄了，吃不下饭。叫他不要去，怎么也劝不住。开始试运转以后，专家们更是守着机器不肯离开，有八位专家一夜没睡，一直工作到第二天清早七点钟。
    我国展开增产节约运动以后，专家就跟技术人员、工人一块研究，改变了一些设计。在不影响工程质量的前提下，他们把下水道的混凝土基础改为就地安装水泥管，集糖斗原设计是用磁砖铺的，现改为铺木板，还减少了一些管路和珐琅盘等，节约了很多资金。有时有的工人不小心，在刚刚打起的水泥地上跑来踩去，缪勒同志看见了，马上就把他拉到旁边去。沃尔夫看见工人随地丢电焊头，就向厂方提出意见：“中国是个大国，只要人人节约，处处小心，就是很大一笔数字，国家就能加快工业化。”专家还叫工人随手带着棉纱，经常擦洗机器。拉包夫斯基常常说：“车间要像医院一样清洁。不然，机器爱生病。机器保养得好，能够延长使用时间，就是最大的节约。”
    两年来，据不完全统计，专家们提出的书面建议和重要的口头建议一共有七百八十四件。这些建议在加速工程进度、保证工程质量和节约资金等等方面，都起了决定性的作用。今年三月开始，专家还编写讲义，给全体职工上大课六十六次，讲授各种机器的操作方法和操作理论。据制糖车间固定工人的测验成绩，得三分以上的在百分之九十以上——这是包头糖厂能够按期投入生产的一个重要条件。
    糖厂为大家，大家为糖厂
    包头糖厂的建设，是为了进一步满足人民的食糖需要，增加社会主义积累，促进国家的社会主义工业化；具体地体现了国家在过渡时期的政策：在集中主要力量发展重工业的同时，相应地发展轻工业和其他经济事业。包头糖厂每年生产的上千上万吨砂糖，将供应到内蒙古和华北各地。副产品酒精、杂醇油等是工业所需原料。甜菜废丝含有蛋白质、糖分、脂肪，是牲畜很好的饲料。因此，包头糖厂的建立，不只能进一步满足人们对食糖的需要，同时还将促进内蒙古自治区畜牧业的发展。
    糖厂所在的地区，土质好，雨量少，日照多，昼夜温度相差很大，有“早穿皮袄午穿纱，抱着火炉吃西瓜”之说。这些，正像“旱地瓜甜”的道理一样，正适宜于甜菜贮积糖分。这儿甜菜的含糖率之大，在目前中国要算第一，一般在百分之十六到二十之间，有的达到百分之二十二。一九五四年五月，动工修建糖厂以后，许多农民代表不断前来参观、访问。回去之后，他们走着宣传，坐着也宣传，号召大家多种甜菜，支援国家工业建设。一九五五年，在内蒙古境内京包铁路沿线，已种甜菜十一万亩。这些甜菜由于种的地好，施的肥多，间苗、移苗、锄草、除虫及时，一般收成都在每亩三千斤以上，有的竟达一万多斤。在这收获的黄金季节，农民已开始拉着牲口，赶着大车，把甜菜往收购站送。农民在支援糖厂生产中，还增加了自己的收入。因此，包头糖厂的建立也将刺激内蒙古自治区农业的发展。
    包头糖厂在建设的时候，曾经受到全国广大人民的热烈支援。吉林、哈尔滨、沈阳、济南、广东、北京石景山等地帮助糖厂培养了三百多名制糖、机械、电气等技术工人。糖厂的建筑物上，有鞍钢的无缝钢管，江西的木材，天津的钢材，唐山的耐火砖，琉璃河的水泥。北京的建筑工人、沈阳的机电工人、太原的铁路工人都曾来参加建设。他们砌砖，浇灌混凝土，有的钻到十几公尺的地底下，分辨地层的性质；有的爬到四十多公尺的高空，架设起重机。四百多位从广东来的机器安装工人，从来没见过雪花。来包头以前，全体开了个“不怕冷”的誓师大会。来到包头后，在冬天，不管塞外的风雪多大，他们全都咬着牙高高兴兴地坚持过来了。而且在他们当中，出现了两位劳动模范，一位先进工作者，三十位先进生产者。他们还提了许多合理化建议。其中一个有名的合理化建议是：在安装又高又大的石灰窑金属窑体的时候，他们改变了分节焊接、分节吊装的设计，采用就地焊接、一次起吊的办法，避免了高空作业，提前二十多天完工，为国家节约了八千多元。这些机器安装工人跟其他所有的工人一样，在支援糖厂的建设当中，很快地提高了自己。原先他们从没见过新式制糖机器，如今，没有专家在旁指导，他们已经能够在广西一座糖厂独立安装捷克斯洛伐克新式机器了。
    在试运转期间，包头糖厂的职工已经写好了保证书：要把更多的又白又甜的“草原牌”砂糖供应全国人民。（附图片）
