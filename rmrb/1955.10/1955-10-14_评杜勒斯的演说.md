Commentary on Dulles' Speech

The Four Foreign Ministers Conference will be held soon. People have great expectations for it and rightly believe that if the countries concerned can hold this meeting in accordance with the Geneva spirit, it will further ease the international situation and consolidate peace. However, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech at the American Legion National Convention on October 10, attempting to make people believe that after the Geneva Four-Power Summit, the international situation remains tense and trust between countries is difficult to establish. He purposefully emphasized differences and opposition, indicating that the United States is unwilling to reduce its troops, advocating the establishment of military blocs, and promoting the overthrow of the systems chosen by the people of the people's democratic countries. His speech did not contain a single word mentioning the need to realize the Geneva spirit, strengthen international cooperation and mutual understanding, and strive for further easing of the international situation. Reuters commented appropriately: "The tone and content of this speech sound like the kind of warning speeches Mr. Dulles used to issue to the Soviet Union before the Geneva Conference." The Geneva Four-Power Summit was a milestone in the beginning of improved international relations after the war. However, only two months after this meeting, Dulles made such remarks, which cannot but be considered very regrettable.

Everyone remembers that after the Geneva Conference, Eisenhower stated that he believed the Soviet Union's desire for peace was sincere. Now, Dulles is trying his best to distort the Soviet Union's peaceful policies, attempting to obliterate the series of efforts the Soviet Union has made to ease the international situation after the Geneva Conference. Dulles wants to make people believe that the Soviet Union's actions to strive for the easing of the international situation are not real, "just a tactic." However, Dulles' attempt is unlikely to succeed.

From the Geneva Conference to now, people have not seen the United States take a single action that truly conforms to the Geneva spirit. Even some American public opinion is dissatisfied with this. "The New York Post" said: "...The United States has let two months pass since the Geneva Conference without any new diplomatic action.... The contrast between Moscow and Washington is striking."

Yes, the contrast is very striking. After the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union made great efforts to implement the Geneva spirit. The Soviet Union's decision to reduce the Soviet armed forces by 640,000 troops, and its initiative to give up the right to lease the Porkkala-Udd naval base ahead of schedule in the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, have had a significant impact on promoting universal disarmament and the withdrawal of military bases in foreign countries. Now Britain has also announced its readiness to cut 100,000 troops. Thanks to the Soviet Union's initiative, the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany established diplomatic relations. This measure helps to bring the two parts of Germany closer together, thereby opening up a realistic way to solve the German question. The Soviet Union has taken the initiative to actively expand contacts with political, scientific, and social figures in Western countries, which is of great significance for enhancing relations and understanding between countries in all aspects. It is fundamentally impossible to belittle or even obliterate the significant contributions made by the Soviet Union in easing the international situation. Dulles' distortion of the Soviet Union's peaceful policies is nothing more than deliberately spreading suspicion in order to maintain mutual distrust between countries.

In his speech, Dulles demanded that peaceful and democratic countries "renounce the use of force" and should not "use military force to achieve national goals." He specifically demanded that the People's Republic of China abandon its sovereignty over Taiwan. We want to answer Dulles: The People's Republic of China has always advocated resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation; it is the United States itself that is using force to achieve national goals of aggression. It is the United States that violated the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, occupied China's territory Taiwan with armed forces, and attempted to use this to obstruct the Chinese government from exercising sovereignty over its own territory. On the other hand, based on our country's consistent position of peacefully resolving international disputes, our Premier Zhou Enlai proposed at the Asian-African Conference that China and the United States hold talks to seek to ease and eliminate the tension in the Taiwan area. Everyone knows that the holding of the Sino-US ambassadorial talks, and the agreement reached on the first item on the agenda, are inseparable from China's active initiative and its firm and unwavering efforts.

Dulles' speech on October 10 shows that in the ruling circles of the United States, there are still some people who are obsessed with and worship force, and put the United States' foreign policy on the basis of the use of force. Dulles declared that the United States would not use force, but in fact he not only stated that the United States would never abandon the huge military machine established in the Korean War, nor would it stop the force that the United States has already used and is using in the Taiwan area, but he also emphasized the resolution passed by the US Congress last winter "authorizing the President" to use force to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. He even described the Chinese government's early release of convicted American airmen to ease the situation as a result of American pressure. Obviously, Dulles believes that the United States can use force to occupy China's territory Taiwan, but China cannot choose its own methods, including the use of force, to exercise sovereignty over its own territory Taiwan. Dulles' request that China "renounce the use of force" is to ask China to give up its exercise of sovereignty over its own territory Taiwan, and to recognize that the United States has the right to use force to invade China's territory Taiwan. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. This is also something that all peace-loving people can never allow.

Liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair, and no one can interfere. The United States' use of force to occupy China's territory Taiwan, creating international tensions, is an international issue and should be resolved through appropriate meetings between China and the United States. If Dulles is really interested in resolving this issue peacefully, he should make a clear statement on China's clear position.

Dulles opposed the policy of independence and autonomy of various countries in the name of opposing neutrality, and tried his best to advocate the organization of exclusive military blocs aimed at deepening division and opposition. He openly stated that "the United States does not advocate neutrality," falsely claiming that "neutrality is an outdated concept today." But the international situation is precisely the opposite of Dulles' wishes. The idea of implementing an independent and autonomous policy is not only not outdated today, but continues to expand and develop in Western Europe and Asian and African countries. The reason for this phenomenon is very simple: The people of all countries have learned from their own experience what consequences participating in exclusive military blocs will bring to them. Because of this, many Asian and African countries and some Western European countries have pursued an independent policy of not participating in any military blocs in world politics. As a result of implementing this policy, they have been able to avoid bearing the burden of expanding armaments and preparing for war, and to avoid the establishment of military bases by the American army on their own territory, so that they have been able to ensure that national sovereignty is not violated and improve their international status.

This independent and autonomous policy is in line with the national interests of these countries, and also in line with the interests of international security and world peace. Therefore, the people of many countries, in order to protect their territorial sovereignty and to oppose being involved in the disaster of expanding armaments and preparing for war, are launching a vigorous movement demanding that their own country implement an independent and autonomous policy. No matter how Dulles opposes it, the trend of independence and autonomy and non-participation in any military blocs is irresistible.

It is very clear that the fundamental purpose of Dulles' speech on October 10 was to undermine the good international atmosphere of the Geneva Conference and hinder the further easing of the international situation, so that he could obstruct and undermine the Four Foreign Ministers Conference that the people of the world wholeheartedly hope will succeed.

But peace-loving people all over the world urgently demand to strengthen international cooperation, and the American people also strongly hope to end the "Cold War." Even in the ruling circles of the United States, sober-minded people believe that peaceful coexistence is the only feasible path. Dulles is repeating the old tune before the Geneva Conference today, and can only put himself in opposition to the people of the whole world. It should not be forgotten that the determination of the people of all countries to safeguard and consolidate the cause of peace is more firm than ever before, and therefore the trend towards easing will also be the main direction of the development of the international situation in the future. Dulles' speech made the people of the world see once again that the forces in the United States that refuse to ease the situation are unwilling to accept this situation and always want to make trouble. This can only make the people of all countries doubly vigilant and fight more persistently to defend and realize the "Geneva spirit." Dulles vainly attempts to stop the surging historical tide, but sooner or later he will realize his tragic failure.

### 评杜勒斯的演说

    评杜勒斯的演说
    四国外长会议很快就要开会了。人民对它抱着很大的期望，并且很正当地认为如果有关各国都能根据日内瓦精神来开这个会，就可以进一步和缓国际局势，巩固和平。但是，美国国务卿杜勒斯十月十日在美国退伍军人团年会上发表演说，却企图使人相信在日内瓦四国首脑会议之后，国际局势仍然只有紧张，国与国之间的信任难以建立。他别有用心地强调分歧和对立，表示美国不愿裁减军队，鼓吹建立军事集团、宣传推翻人民民主国家人民所选择的制度。他的演说通篇没有一个字提到有必要实现日内瓦精神，加强国际合作和相互谅解，为国际局势的进一步缓和而努力。路透社的评论恰当地指出：“这篇演说的声调和内容，听起来倒像是杜勒斯先生在日内瓦会议举行以前老向苏联发出的那种警告演说。”日内瓦四国首脑会议是战后国际关系开始改善的里程碑。可是，现在离这个会议仅仅两个多月的今天，杜勒斯竟然发表这样的言论，这不能不令人认为是十分遗憾的。
    大家记得，在日内瓦会议闭幕后，艾森豪威尔曾表示他相信苏联希望和平的意愿是真诚的。现在，杜勒斯却竭力歪曲苏联的和平政策，企图抹煞苏联在日内瓦会议后为和缓国际局势所作的一系列的努力。杜勒斯想使人们相信，苏联争取国际局势缓和的行动是不真实的，“仅仅是一种策略”。不过，杜勒斯的这一企图是很难达到目的的。
    从日内瓦会议到现在，人们没有看见美国作出一件真正符合于日内瓦精神的行动。这是连美国有一些舆论也不满意的。“纽约邮报”就说：“……美国自从日内瓦会议以来，让时间过了两个月而没有任何新的外交行动……。莫斯科和华盛顿之间的对比是显著的。”
    是的，对比是很显著。在日内瓦会议以后，苏联在实施日内瓦精神方面，作了巨大努力。苏联关于裁减苏联武装部队六十四万人的决定，以及在苏芬谈判中主动提早放弃租借波卡拉乌德海军基地的权利，对于促进普遍裁军和撤销在外国的军事基地，发生了重大的推动作用。现在英国也宣布准备裁军十万人。由于苏联的倡议，苏联同德意志联邦共和国建立了外交关系。这一措施有助于德国东西两个部分的接近，从而为德国问题的解决开辟了现实的途径。苏联主动积极扩大同西方国家政治、科学和社会各界人士的接触，这对于从各方面增进国与国的联系和谅解，有很重要的意义。要想贬低甚至抹煞苏联在和缓国际局势方面所作的重大贡献，是根本不可能的。杜勒斯对苏联和平政策的歪曲，无非是故意散布猜疑，借以保持国与国之间的互不信任。
    杜勒斯在演说中要求和平民主国家“弃绝武力”，不应当“使用军事力量以达到国家的目的”。他特别要求中华人民共和国放弃对台湾行使主权。我们要回答杜勒斯：中华人民共和国是一贯地主张用和平协商的方式来解决国际争端的；行使武力以达到国家的侵略目的的，恰恰是美国自己。是美国违反联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，以武装力量霸占了中国领土台湾，企图借以阻挠中国政府对它自己的领土行使主权。可是另一方面，根据我国和平解决国际争端的一贯立场，我国总理周恩来早在亚非会议上即倡议中美两国举行会谈，来谋求缓和和消除台湾地区的紧张局势。大家知道中美两国大使级会谈的举行，以及这一会谈就第一项议程达成协议，是同中国方面的积极主动和它的坚定不移的努力分不开的。
    杜勒斯十月十日的演说表明，在美国的统治集团中，有一部分人至今还迷信和崇拜武力，把美国的对外政策放在行使武力的基础之上。杜勒斯声言美国要不使用武力，但实际上他却不仅表示美国决不放弃在朝鲜战争中建立起来的庞大的军事机器，决不停止美国在台湾地区已经和正在行使的武力，他并且强调去年冬天美国国会通过的“授权总统”使用武力阻挠中国人民解放台湾的决议。他甚至把中国政府为和缓局势而提前释放犯罪的美国飞行人员也说成是美国压力的结果。很显然，杜勒斯认为美国可以使用武力来霸占中国的领土台湾，而中国却不能选择自己的方法，包括使用武力在内，对自己的领土台湾行使主权。杜勒斯要求中国“弃绝武力”，就是要求中国放弃它对自己的领土台湾行使主权，而承认美国有权利使用武力侵占中国领土台湾。这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。这也是一切爱好和平人民决不能容许的。
    解放台湾是中国的内政问题，任何人都不能干涉。美国使用武力霸占中国的领土台湾，造成国际紧张局势，是国际问题，应该经过中美之间适当的会议来加以解决。杜勒斯如果真有意和平解决这个问题，他就应该对中国的这个明确主张作出明确的表示。
    杜勒斯在反对中立的名义下反对各国独立自主的政策，竭力鼓吹组织旨在加深分裂和对立的排他性军事集团。他公开地表示“美国不主张实行中立”，妄称“中立在今天已经是一个陈腐的概念”。但是国际局势恰恰同杜勒斯的愿望相反，实行独立自主政策的思想在今天不仅没有过时，而且在西欧和亚非各国中继续不断地扩大和发展。产生这种现象的原因十分简单：各国人民根据自己的切身经验认识了参加排他性的军事集团将会对他们带来什么样的后果。因为这样，所以许多亚洲和非洲国家和有的西欧国家，在世界政治中执行了不参加任何军事集团的独立政策。执行这种政策的结果，使它们得以避免承担扩军备战的重担，得以避免美国军队在本国领土上建立军事基地，从而它们就有可能保障国家主权的不受侵犯，提高了它们的国际地位。
    这种独立自主政策既符合于这些国家的民族利益，也符合于国际安全和世界和平的利益。因此，许多国家的人民，为了保障自己的领土主权，为了反对卷入扩军备战的灾难，正在掀起有力的要求本国实施独立自主政策的运动。不管杜勒斯如何反对，独立自主、不参加任何军事集团的趋势是不可抵抗的。
    十分明显，杜勒斯十月十日演说的根本目的，是想破坏日内瓦会议的国际良好气氛，阻挠国际局势的进一步缓和，以便他阻挠和破坏世界人民全心希望成功的四国外长会议。
    但是全世界爱好和平的人士，迫切地要求加强国际合作，美国人民也强烈地希望结束“冷战”。即使在美国统治集团中，头脑清醒的人士也认为和平共处是唯一可行的道路。杜勒斯在今天重弹日内瓦会议以前的老调，就只能把自己放在同全世界人民相对立的地位。不应当忘记，现在各国人民为维护和巩固和平事业的决心，比以往任何时候都更加坚定，因而走向缓和也将是今后国际局势发展的主要方向。杜勒斯的演说使世界人民再一次看清美国国内拒绝和缓局势的势力对这种局势不肯甘心，总要捣乱。这只能使各国人民加倍提高警惕、为保卫和实现“日内瓦精神”而更加坚持不懈地斗争。杜勒斯妄想拦阻汹涌澎湃的历史潮流，但是，迟早他会认识到他的悲惨的失败。
