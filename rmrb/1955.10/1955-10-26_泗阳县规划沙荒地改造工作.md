    Siyang County Plans Sand Waste Land Transformation
    The People's Committee of Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, has recently formulated a comprehensive transformation plan for the county's sandy wasteland based on the county's soil conditions. The initial plan is to transform more than 26,500 mu of sandy wasteland into arable and afforestable good farmland.
    Siyang County has 90,000 mu of sandy wasteland along the old course of the Yellow River. This sandy wasteland not only does not grow crops, but when the wind blows, the sand and soil kill and submerge nearby crops, greatly affecting the growth of crops. Since liberation, the people's government has continuously led local farmers to plant trees and create forests to fight against wind and sand. In recent years, the county has afforested more than 10,000 mu, reducing the damage caused by wind and sand. In areas with windbreaks, wheat yields have increased from more than 30 jin in the past to 80 or 90 jin. (Zhou Yuxi Lu Bingjun)

    泗阳县规划沙荒地改造工作
    江苏省泗阳县人民委员会最近根据全县土质情况，对全县的沙荒地订出了全面的改造规划。初步计划将二万六千五百多亩的沙荒地改造为宜农、宜林的良田。
    泗阳县沿旧黄河故道一带，共有沙荒地九万亩，这些沙荒地不仅不长庄稼，大风吹起沙土反而打死和淹没附近庄稼，大大影响了农作物的生长。解放后，人民政府不断领导当地农民植树造林来同风沙作斗争，几年来全县已造林一万余亩，减轻了风沙的灾害。有防沙林的地方，小麦产量已由过去三十多斤提高到八九十斤。（周裕喜　陆炳君）
