In the activities of carrying out the "Cold War" and poisoning the international atmosphere, the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) plays an important role.

This organization was established as early as 1949. However, until the end of 1953, the existence of this committee was kept secret - Western journalists were ordered not to mention it in their dispatches.

It can be seen that the activities of COCOM are not very glorious.

Outsiders find it difficult to understand in detail how this committee works. In short, it can arbitrarily stipulate what goods are "strategic" and what are not. Once goods are classified as "strategic" materials, they are prohibited from being shipped to the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies. An article in the British magazine "Eastern World" wrote: COCOM "has absolute power to decide what contracts British and other countries' merchants can sign with communist countries... The British Board of Trade and the commercial departments of other European countries will not issue licenses for export goods to communist countries without the consent of COCOM."

Then, "where does COCOM's power come from?" "Eastern World" reasonably raised this question. The publication then gave the following answer: "Strangely enough, no one can find out how it operates. It is a genuine organization for conspiracy that has emerged from informal contacts over the years. It is not responsible to any government or superior organization... (Perhaps the U.S. State Department is an exception, because the Battle Act is interpreted and implemented by the U.S. State Department.)" It is known that the U.S. Battle Act, which came into effect in August 1951, stipulates that if Western countries violate COCOM's "ban," the United States will suspend economic and military "aid" to them.

Relying on an organization like COCOM and the intimidation of the Battle Act, the United States has reduced Britain's trade with the socialist camp to one-sixth of its pre-war level, and France's to one-quarter.

It is difficult to imagine what real benefits such a sharp decline in export levels would bring to Western European capitalist countries. In fact, COCOM is not only used as a "Cold War" tool to obstruct East-West trade, but also as a powerful weapon for Uncle Sam to strike at his competitors.

According to "Eastern World," COCOM has some subcommittees "composed of people with financial and commercial interests," and these subcommittees often use their power "to play commercial tricks." "A prominent example is this: A British manufacturer signed a contract with Russia to build three whaling factory ships worth one million pounds. Before issuing a license to the manufacturer, the British Board of Trade asked COCOM to decide whether such ships could be exported to the Soviet Union. The subcommittee of the committee discussed the issue and recommended to the committee that the contract be cancelled. In the end, the contract was cancelled because no export license was issued. While this bureaucratic tactic was rampant, someone in COCOM told a West German manufacturer the details of the contract. This manufacturer then fought for and won the order, this time to build twenty-one whaling factory ships worth approximately seven million pounds."

The news leaked from the Palais de Chaillot in Paris will certainly not attract business for British and French companies. "Eastern World" wrote indignantly: "The United States' decisive influence on COCOM's decisions favors West German, Swiss, and sometimes Dutch companies, rather than British, French, or other countries' companies. British manufacturers have never benefited from leaked trade secrets."

"A genuine organization for conspiracy," such a title is very accurate for COCOM. Of course, the disgruntled "Eastern World" only focuses on British business interests; from a global perspective, from the perspective of its role in poisoning the international atmosphere, isn't there even more reason to call this committee that?

### “一个真正的阴谋活动组织”

    “一个真正的阴谋活动组织”
    在进行“冷战”、毒化国际气氛的活动中，巴黎统筹委员会扮演着重要的角色。
    这个机构早在一九四九年就成立了。但是，直到一九五三年年底以前，对于这个委员会的存在，是一直保守秘密的——西方各国的新闻记者，都奉命不准在电讯中提到它。
    可见，巴黎统筹委员会的活动，是并不十分光彩的。
    这个委员会究竟怎样进行工作，局外人很难详细了解。总之，它可以随意地规定什么货物是属于“战略”的，和什么不是战略物资。货物一经列为“战略”物资，就被禁止运往苏联、中国和人民民主国家。英国“东方世界”杂志的一篇文章写道：巴黎统筹委员会“具有绝对的权力来决定英国和其他国家的商人可以同共产主义国家签订什么合同。……英国的贸易部和其他欧洲国家的商业部，如果得不到统筹委员会的同意，就不会签发许可证给予输往共产主义国家的出口货物。”
    那末，巴黎统筹委员会的“权力是从哪里来的呢？”“东方世界”十分合理地提出了这个问题。这个刊物接着作了这样的解答：“奇怪的是没有一个人能够获悉它是怎样在活动的。这是从数年前非正式的接触中产生出来的一个真正的阴谋活动组织。它是不向任何政府或上级组织负责的……（也许美国国务院是例外，因为巴特尔法是由美国国务院解释和执行的）。”人们知道，一九五一年八月生效的美国巴特尔法规定，西方国家如果破坏了巴黎统筹委员会的“禁令”，美国便要对它停止经济和军事“援助”。
    就是依靠巴黎统筹委员会这样一个组织，依靠巴特尔法的恫吓，美国把英国对社会主义阵营的贸易，压低到战前水平的六分之一，法国——四分之一。
    很难设想，出口水平这样急剧的下降，会对西欧资本主义国家带来什么真正的好处。事实上，巴黎统筹委员会不仅被当作阻碍东西方贸易的“冷战”工具。而且也是山姆大叔打击自己的竞争者的有力武器。
    据“东方世界”揭露，统筹委员会下面有一些小组委员会，“是由某些拥有金融和商业利益的人物组成的，”这些小组委员会经常利用自己的职权“来耍商业性质的手段”。“有一个著名的事例是这样一回事：有一家英国厂商同俄国签订了一个承造三艘捕鲸工作船的、价值一百万英镑的合同。英国贸易部在签发许可证给该厂商之前要求巴黎统筹委员会决定这种船只是否可以输出给苏联。该委员会的小组委员会讨论了这个问题，并向委员会建议把那个合同取消。最后，因为不发给出口许可证，那个合同就被取消了。当这种打官腔手段大行其道的时候，巴黎统筹委员会中有人把那项合同的详细情况告诉了西德一家厂商。这家厂商就争取而且获得了这批订货，而且这次是承造二十一艘捕鲸工作船，约值七百万英镑。”
    从巴黎夏乐宫里透露出来的消息，当然不会替英国和法国的企业招徕生意。“东方世界”愤愤不平地写道：“美国对于巴黎统筹委员会的决定性影响，偏袒着西德的、瑞士的，有时是荷兰的企业，而不是英国、法国或其他国家的企业。英国的厂商从来没有从走漏的贸易秘密得到任何益处。”
      “一个真正的阴谋活动组织”，这样一个称号，对于巴黎统筹委员会是十分确切的。固然，满腹牢骚的“东方世界”，只是从英国的生意经上来着眼的；从世界范围来看，从它对毒化国际气氛所起的作用来看，难道不更有理由来这样称呼这个委员会吗？（如）
