    Hubei to Reclaim 80,000 Mu of Tea Plantations This Winter

    Hubei Province has begun vigorously reclaiming tea plantations, with plans to reclaim 30,000 mu by next spring. In addition, over 50,000 mu of barren land will be newly cultivated in mountainous and hilly areas for tea planting. The combined area is equivalent to a quarter of the existing tea plantations. Reclamation work is currently underway in counties such as Puqi and Tongcheng. To meet the needs of developing tea production, a tea-hemp farm with a large development scale will be newly built in Macheng County this winter, and the site has been preliminarily surveyed.

    Hubei Province is one of the major tea-producing areas in the country. During the Japanese occupation and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, more than 100,000 mu of tea plantations were abandoned. Although tea production has increased every year since liberation, it has not yet recovered to pre-war levels. Hubei Province is now simultaneously reclaiming abandoned tea plantations and systematically reclaiming wasteland for tea planting, continuing to increase tea production. (Yuan Jun)

    湖北今冬将垦辟茶园八万亩
    湖北省开始大力垦复茶园，计划到明春垦复三万亩；另外在山区和丘陵地区新辟荒地五万多亩种茶，两项面积相当于现有茶园的四分之一。垦复工作正在蒲圻、通城等县着手进行，适应发展茶叶生产的需要，今冬将在麻城县新建一个有很大发展规模的茶麻场，场址已经初步勘完。
    湖北省是全国主要产茶地区之一，在日寇占领和国民党反动统治时期荒废茶园十万亩以上。解放以来茶叶产量虽然每年提高，但还不能恢复到战前的水平。湖北省现正一面垦复荒废茶园，一面有计划地开荒种茶，继续提高茶叶产量。（袁军）
