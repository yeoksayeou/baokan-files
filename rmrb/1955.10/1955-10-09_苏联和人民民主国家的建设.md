Soviet Union Uses Atomic Energy to Explore for Oil

Atomic energy is helping oil workers in the Azerbaijan Republic of the Soviet Union to discover underground secrets and exploit the country's resources. Workers are using highly penetrating gamma rays for exploration. Dozens of sets of industrial equipment using radiological methods are working in various oil fields.

An instrument that can detect gamma rays is now widely used. When this instrument is slowly lowered into the well, it can detect the different strengths of gamma rays emitted by the rock layers and convert them into electrical signals that are transmitted to the surface via cable, where they are recorded on film. Experts develop the film and use the curves on it to determine the geological conditions of the oil well.

This method is much more effective than the previous electrical logging method.

However, gamma-ray logging devices sometimes fail to achieve perfect results. In this case, an instrument that emits a neutron flow can be added. Under the influence of neutrons, the gamma rays of the rock layer become stronger, thus making the graphics recorded on the film clearer. In this way, not only can the nature of the oil layer be determined, but also the density of the oil layer.

The use of radiological methods can not only take measures to increase the daily oil production of oil wells, but also enable oil wells that have stopped producing oil to resume production. In the "Lenin Petroleum Industry" Oil Field Administration Bureau, the daily oil production of various oil fields has increased by several hundred tons due to the use of new methods to survey 1,500 oil wells. In the "Stalin Petroleum Industry" Oil Field Administration Bureau, an oil well that had stopped producing oil seventeen years ago was put back into production after a new survey, and the initial output was 18 tons.

Vietnam's Northern Regions Expand Autumn Rice Planting Area

More than 1.26 million hectares of land in northern Vietnam have been planted with autumn rice. This number far exceeds the planting area of autumn rice last year, and also increased by about 50% compared with the planting area of summer rice this year.

In the left bank of the Red River region, the Third Inter-zone of the Viet Bac Inter-zone, and the Thai-Meo Autonomous Region, the autumn rice planting work is nearing completion, and harvesting has begun in the earlier planted areas. According to estimates by personnel from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, each hectare of land in the areas that have already begun harvesting can yield at least 1.4 tons, and the highest yield may reach 2 or 3 tons, which is much higher than the previous yield.

Poland Uses Atomic Energy to Examine Works of Art

Polish scientists are trying to use radioactive isotopes for scientific research in the field of art and for the treatment of diseases.

The Warsaw National Museum recently obtained radioactive isotopes of thallium and cesium from the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences. For some time, the museum's laboratory has been studying the use of radioactive isotopes to solve the difficulties encountered by the museum. Isotopes are of great help not only in verifying the authenticity of works of art and their state of preservation, but also in many cases they can be used to determine what materials the works of art are made of and the methods used in the creative process.

Medical researchers in Warsaw are currently preparing to use radioactive isotopes of cobalt, iodine, phosphorus, and other elements to treat diseases. Doctors will soon be able to use radioactive cobalt to effectively treat cancer.

Czechoslovakia Uses Atomic Energy to Inspect Steel Weldments

Since last year, the Gottwald Steel Plant in Vitkovice, Ostrava, one of Czechoslovakia's largest steel conglomerates, has been using a very flexible and effective radioactive isotope irradiation device to inspect internal cracks in welds of bridges, boilers, and other structures. The device itself weighs only about one gram, and even with the protective lead baffle, it weighs less than 50 kilograms. When using this device, only one exposure is required, and the entire condition of the weld in a circle around the irradiator can be inspected.

The experience of workers in this factory proves that objects with a thickness of 60 to 200 millimeters or even thicker, and objects that cannot be inspected by X-ray irradiation, can be irradiated and inspected using this equipment.

Hungary: Large Numbers of Farmers Join Production Cooperatives

The agricultural collectivization movement in Hungary has entered a new period of vigorous development. In the first eight months of this year, 43,000 farmers joined cooperatives, and 220 new cooperatives were established. After two years of stagnation and rectification, cooperatives are becoming increasingly popular with working farmers. There are now 4,600 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide, with a total of 214,000 members, owning 1.15 million hectares of land. 73.4% of them are third-class (highest-level) cooperatives, and the income of the members is basically distributed according to the labor days performed by each person.

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联利用原子能勘探石油
    原子能正在帮助苏联阿塞拜疆共和国的石油工人探知地下的秘密，开采祖国的财富。工人们正利用具有很大穿透力的丙种射线来进行勘探。几十套应用放射方法的工业设备正在各油场工作着。
    有一种能测知丙种射线的仪器现在已普遍采用了。把这种仪器慢慢放入井下，它可以测知岩层放射出的不同强弱的丙种射线，并且把它们转变成电力信号经电缆传到井上来，随即记录在胶片上。专家把胶片显影，根据这上面的曲线就能确定油井地质层的情况。
    这种方法比以前的电测法有效得多。
    但是，丙种射线测井器有时也不能达到完满的结果，这时就可添加一个放射出中子流的仪器。在中子的影响下，岩层的丙种射线就会更强，从而使得记在胶片上的图形更加明确。这样，不仅可以确定油层的性质，并且可以确定油层的密度。
    利用放射方法后不仅可以采取措施使油井每昼夜出油量增加，而且可使停止产油的油井重新出油。在“列宁石油业”油场管理局，由于利用新方法勘测了一千五百个油井，各油场每昼夜的采油量提高了几百吨。在“斯大林石油业”油场管理局中有一个油井十七年前已停止出油，但在进行新法勘察之后，它又投入了生产，而且一开始的产量就有十八吨。
    越南北方扩大秋稻播种面积
    越南北方目前已经有一百二十六万多公顷的土地播种了秋稻。这个数目远远超过了去年秋稻的播种面积，比今年夏稻播种面积也增加了百分之五十左右。
    在红河左岸地区、越北联区第三联区和泰—苗自治区等地，秋稻的播种工作已接近完成，播种较早地区并且已经开始收获。据农林部人员估计，已经开始收获的地区每公顷土地至少可收一·四吨，最高收获量可能达到两吨或三吨，比以前的收获量高得多。波利用原子能检验艺术品
    波兰科学家正在设法利用放射性同位素进行艺术方面的科学研究工作和治疗疾病。
    华沙国家博物馆最近从波兰科学院原子核研究所得到了铊和铯的放射性同位素。若干时候以来，博物馆的实验室就在研究利用放射性同位素来解决博物馆所碰到的困难的问题。同位素不仅在检验艺术品的真伪和它们的保存状况方面有很大帮助，而且在许多情况下还可以用来确定艺术品是用什么材料制成的和在创造过程中所使用的方法。
    华沙的医学研究工作者最近正在准备应用钴、碘、磷和其他元素的放射性同位素来治病。医生们不久就可以用放射性钴来有成效地治疗癌症。捷使用原子能检查钢铁焊件
    捷克斯洛伐克最大的钢铁联合企业之一——俄斯特拉发州维特科维泽的哥特瓦尔德钢铁工厂，从去年以来在检查桥梁和锅炉等的焊接处的内部裂缝时，使用一种十分灵便有效的放射性同位素照射设备。这种设备的本身大约只有一克重，加上保护用的铅挡板也不到五十公斤重。使用这种设备时，只须露光一次，放在照射体周围的一个圆圈中的焊接处的整个情况就可以受到检查。
    这个工厂的工人的经验证明，厚度六十到二百公厘、甚至更厚的物件，以及不能用爱克斯光照射检查的物件，都可以使用这种装备来进行照射和检查。匈大批农民加入生产合作社
    匈牙利农业合作化运动进入新的蓬勃发展的时期。在今年头八个月中，新加入合作社的有四万三千个农民，成立了二百二十个新社。经过两年的停滞和整顿阶段后，合作社越来越受劳动农民的欢迎了。现在全国的农业生产合作社已经达到四千六百个，共有二十一万四千个社员，拥有土地一百一十五万公顷。其中有百分之七十三点四是第三类（最高级）的合作社，社员的收入基本上是按各人所做的劳动日来分配的。　（据新华社讯）
