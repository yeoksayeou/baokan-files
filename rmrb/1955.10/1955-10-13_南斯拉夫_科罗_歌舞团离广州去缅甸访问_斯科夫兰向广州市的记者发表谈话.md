    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th. The Yugoslav "Kolo" Folk Dance Troupe, headed by O. Skovran, concluded their performance tour in Guangzhou, the last city on their visit to China. They left Guangzhou by special train this morning, the 12th, via Hong Kong for a visit to Burma. Zhou Weizhi, Deputy Director of the Art Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, accompanied them to Shenzhen.
    Those who saw them off at the station included Zhu Guang, Mayor of Guangzhou; Guo Qiaoran, Deputy Mayor; Xiao Junying, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Cultural Bureau; Ding Bo, Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Cultural Bureau; and more than 500 literary and art workers and young students from Guangzhou. The well-wishers presented bouquets of flowers to Skovran and all members of the dance troupe. When a member of the dance troupe played "The East is Red" on the accordion, literary and art workers from both China and Yugoslavia sang along with the music. As the train was about to depart, the guests and hosts repeatedly shook hands to say goodbye with reluctance.
    After arriving in Guangzhou on the 10th, the dance troupe held the closing ceremony of their performance tour in China that evening. On the evening of the 11th, Zhu Guang, Mayor of Guangzhou, hosted a banquet on behalf of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China to bid farewell to all members of the dance troupe. The distinguished guests also visited the former site of the Peasant Movement Training Institute, the Lingnan Cultural Relics Palace, and other places of interest in Guangzhou. Skovran and some members of the troupe visited the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition in Guangzhou on the 11th.
    During their one-and-a-half-month stay in China, the dance troupe visited and performed in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shenyang, Anshan, Guangzhou, and other places, and were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of audiences throughout China.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th. O. Skovran, head of the Yugoslav "Kolo" Folk Dance Troupe, told reporters in Guangzhou on the 11th: China and Yugoslavia are moving towards a common goal. In order to strengthen and consolidate the friendship between the peoples of the two countries, it is necessary to continue to strengthen exchanges between the peoples of the two countries, strengthen cultural exchanges, and send students to study in each other's countries, so that the two countries will become closer.
    Skovran told reporters that all members of the dance troupe have now become the most sincere and enthusiastic friends of the Chinese people. She said: We have seen the achievements of China in all aspects with our own eyes, and we know that the Chinese people are sincere and modest. After we return to our country, we will definitely tell the Yugoslav people everything we have seen in China.
    In her speech, Skovran thanked the Chinese people for their warm reception and friendship. Skovran emphasized: "This friendship is not only for us, but also for our country. Just as Premier Zhou Enlai said, in the future we should work together for the development and consolidation of the friendship between the Chinese and Yugoslav peoples."
    Skovran expressed her admiration for the achievements of Chinese culture and art she had seen in various parts of China, and especially praised Chinese Peking Opera. She said: "The art of your country is rarely seen in other countries, because it combines singing, dancing, music, and martial arts performance, and integrates various artistic elements into one, and has a very high artistic level." Finally, Skovran asked the reporters to convey the dance troupe's congratulations - "Wish the Chinese people and the comrades who have met with all members of the dance troupe greater achievements."
