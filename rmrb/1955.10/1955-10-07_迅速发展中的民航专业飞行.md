Rapidly Developing Civil Aviation Professional Flying
    Feng Bo

In recent years, China's civil aviation industry has been continuously developing. Air routes are increasing year by year, and the volume of passenger and freight transport is growing year by year. Especially in serving industrial and agricultural production, many civil aviation professional flights that China has never had before have been pioneered.

In the spring of 1952, forest protection aircraft appeared for the first time in the famous Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and Changbai Mountains. Dense primeval forests grow here, containing a large number of valuable timbers such as red pine, larch, birch, and ash. Every year in the spring and autumn, the weather is dry and the grass withers, and forest fires often occur. In the past, a fire often burned continuously for more than half a month, causing huge losses to people's property. Since 1952, aircraft have participated in forest protection every spring and autumn. From the Ergune River in the west, along the Heilongjiang River in the north, to the Ussuri River in the east, and the Yalu River in the south, all the forests in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and Changbai Mountains are under aircraft surveillance. In the struggle for forest fire prevention, aircraft have played a role in reconnaissance of fire conditions, commanding ground fire fighting, and delivering tools and materials to the fire scene, greatly reducing the difficulties in ground forest fire prevention work.

In recent years, the achievements of aircraft locust control have left a deep and unforgettable impression on farmers in many areas. In July this year, locust plagues occurred in many areas of the North China Plain. The Civil Aviation Administration of China promptly launched aircraft locust control work in Baoding, Cangxian, Xinxiang, Tianjin and other places. In Baoding alone, three aircraft controlled locusts over nearly 500,000 mu in eight days. Employees participating in locust control launched labor competitions, and many people worked more than ten hours a day, with each aircraft spraying 40,000 mu of insecticide powder per day. The average locust mortality rate reached 87 percent.

Aircraft prospecting work started last year. This year, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Gansu, Henan and other places have sent prospecting aircraft, and the prospecting tasks have increased several times compared with last year. In prospecting flights, operational requirements are very strict. The aircraft must maintain stability and the heading must be accurate. Encouraged by the enthusiasm to discover underground treasures for the motherland, the employees of the Civil Aviation Administration have worked hard to study and learn humbly, and constantly overcome the shortcomings in their work. Most of this year's aircraft prospecting tasks have been completed, and prospecting flights are now in the final stage.

The work of surveying forest areas using aerial photography methods, which began this year, is being carried out successfully under the direct assistance of Soviet experts. This year also saw the start of experiments on using aircraft to spray chemical agents to extinguish forest fires, using aircraft to fertilize, and using aircraft to control cotton insects. These have opened up broad avenues for the civil aviation industry to serve industrial and agricultural production.

This year, the tasks of forest protection, locust control, magnetic surveys (i.e., aircraft prospecting) and delivering newspaper stereotypes undertaken by the Civil Aviation Administration of China are more than in any previous year. By the end of September, the annual professional flight production targets had been completed ahead of schedule. Now, all aircrew and ground crew are enthusiastically launching labor competitions, striving to overfulfill production tasks by a greater margin while ensuring flight safety, and supporting the country's socialist construction.

    迅速发展中的民航专业飞行
    冯波
    这几年，我国民用航空事业在不断地发展着。航线一年年增长，客运和货运数量一年比一年加多。特别是在为工农业生产服务方面，已经开创了我国从来没有过的许多项民航专业飞行。
    一九五二年春，在有名的大小兴安岭和长白山上，初次出现了护林的飞机。这里生长着茂密的原始森林，其中有大量红松、落叶松、桦树和水曲柳等珍贵的木材。在每年的春秋两季，天干草枯，森林中常常发生火灾。过去，一场火往往连续燃烧半个多月，使人民财产遭受巨大的损失。自从一九五二年以来，每年春秋两季都有飞机参加护林。西起额尔古纳河，北沿黑龙江，东至乌苏里江，南到鸭绿江，所有大小兴安岭和长白山的森林都在飞机巡视之下。在护林防火的斗争中，飞机发挥了侦察火情、指挥地面灭火和向火场投送工具、物资等项作用，大大地减少了地面护林防火工作中的困难。
    几年来飞机治蝗的成绩，在许多地区的农民中留下了深刻难忘的印象。今年七月间，华北平原上不少地区发生了蝗灾。中国民用航空局及时在保定、沧县、新乡、天津等地展开了飞机治蝗工作。仅在保定一地，三架飞机用八天时间就治蝗近五十万亩。参加治蝗工作的职工们开展了劳动竞赛，不少人每天工作十几小时，每天每架飞机喷药粉四万亩。蝗虫死亡率平均达百分之八十七。
    飞机探矿工作从去年开始，今年内蒙古、河北、甘肃和河南等地都派有探矿的飞机，探矿任务比去年增加了好几倍。在探矿飞行中，操作要求非常严格。飞机既要保持平稳，航向又要保持准确。在为祖国发现地下宝藏的热情鼓舞下，民航局的职工们刻苦钻研，虚心学习，不断克服了工作中的缺点。今年的飞机探矿任务大部分已经完成，现在正在进行最后阶段的探矿飞行。
    今年开始的用空中摄影方法调查林区的工作，在苏联专家直接帮助下，正在胜利地进行着。今年还开始了用飞机喷射化学药剂扑灭林区火灾、用飞机施肥和用飞机治棉虫等试验。这都为民航事业为工农业生产服务打开了广阔的道路。
    今年，中国民用航空局担负的护林、治蝗、磁测（即飞机探矿）以及送报纸纸型等项专业飞行的任务，比以往任何一年都多。到九月底，全年专业飞行的生产指标已经提前完成。现在，全体空勤和地勤人员正在热烈开展劳动竞赛，在保证飞行安全的条件下，争取更多地超额完成生产任务，支援国家的社会主义建设。
