Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 12th. According to TASS, Helsinki, 11th: The Central Committee of the Finnish Communist Party held a plenary session in Helsinki on the 8th and 9th.

The General Secretary of the Finnish Communist Party, A. Aaltonen, delivered a report at the meeting, in which he talked about the most important recent international and domestic events. Speaking of the Finnish-Soviet negotiations, Aaltonen said that extending the validity of the Finnish-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, concluded in 1948, by twenty years is in line with the vital interests and ardent wishes of our people. The Soviet Union's abandonment of the Porkkala Peninsula proves the further strengthening of the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland, which are based on mutual trust. This step is related to the favorable development of the international situation and the relaxation of tensions.

Speaking of Finland's preparations to participate in the Nordic Council, Aaltonen said that the Communist Party opposes Finland's participation in the Nordic Council because we believe that this organization is trying to make Finland and Sweden, along with Norway, Denmark, and Iceland, serve the military purposes of the North Atlantic Alliance. Aaltonen stated that although the Nordic Council cannot be equated with the North Atlantic Alliance, the North Atlantic Alliance still has an influence on the Nordic Council, and three members of the Council are also members of the North Atlantic Alliance. Aaltonen pointed out that the reservations made by the government in its proposal on this issue do not exclude the possibility of the Nordic Council discussing military and political issues.

Finally, speaking of the preparations for the presidential election, Aaltonen called on the entire party to strengthen the election campaign.

The meeting passed a resolution welcoming the agreement between Finland and the Soviet Union on extending the Finnish-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance and on returning the Porkkala territory. The resolution pointed out: These agreements are a great victory for international friendship and peaceful policies, and they are in line with Finland's national interests, consolidate the foundation of peace in the entire north, and will help consolidate the great cause of world peace.

    芬兰共产党中央委员会举行全体会议
    新华社十二日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基十一日讯：芬兰共产党中央委员会八日和九日在赫尔辛基举行了全体会议。
    芬兰共产党总书记培西在会议上做了报告，他谈到最近一些最重要的国际事件和国内事件。培西在谈到芬苏谈判时说，把一九四八年缔结的芬苏友好合作互助条约的有效期延长二十年，是符合我国人民的切身利益和他们的热切愿望的。苏联放弃波卡拉半岛，这证明苏联同芬兰之间的以互相信任为基础的友好关系有了进一步的加强。这一步骤是同国际局势的有利发展和紧张局势的缓和有关系的。
    培西在谈到芬兰准备参加北欧理事会的一些措施时说，共产党反对芬兰参加北欧理事会，因为我们认为这个组织在竭力使芬兰、瑞典同挪威、丹麦和冰岛一道为着北大西洋联盟的军事目的而服务。培西表示，虽然不能把北欧理事会和北大西洋联盟等量齐观，但是北大西洋联盟对北欧理事会仍然是有影响的，理事会的三个成员国同时也是北大西洋联盟的成员国。培西指出，政府在关于这个问题的建议中所作的保留，并没有排除北欧理事会讨论军事和政治问题的可能性。
    培西最后在谈到选举总统的准备工作时，号召全党加强竞选工作。
    会议通过决议，欢迎芬兰和苏联两国之间关于延长芬苏友好合作互助条约的协定和关于归还波卡拉领土的协定。决议指出：这些协定是国际友谊和和平政策的巨大胜利，这些协定符合芬兰的民族利益，它巩固了整个北方的和平基础，并将有助于巩固世界和平的伟大事业。
