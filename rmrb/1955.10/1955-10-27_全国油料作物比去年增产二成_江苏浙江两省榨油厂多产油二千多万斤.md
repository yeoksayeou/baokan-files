Xinhua News Agency, 26th. This year, the national oil crops had a bumper harvest, with an output increase of approximately 20% compared to last year. Acquisition is currently underway in various regions. Sesame, which matures earlier, began to enter the market in September. Major producing areas like Anhui, Hubei, and Henan entered the peak acquisition season in October. In Xinyang Prefecture, Henan Province, the average daily acquisition volume in October increased nearly threefold compared to September. According to statistics from the China Oils and Fats Corporation, as of early October, the national acquisition of sesame reached approximately 15% of the fourth-quarter acquisition plan. Peanuts, which mature later, are also entering the market in large quantities. In Linyi and Jiaozhou Prefectures of Shandong Province, which have large peanut yields, more than 150 acquisition points have been established.

In the acquisition of oil crops, various regions implemented the policy of "more production, more gain, more production, more retention," and, based on the principle of superior quality, superior price, rationally divided the price levels, taking into account the interests of the farmers.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th. This year, more than 200 oil mills in Jiangsu Province have increased production by more than 16 million jin of vegetable oil.

After learning and mastering Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil extraction operation method, sixteen local state-owned oil mills in the province averaged more than 43 jin of oil per 100 jin of peanut kernels and more than 35 jin of oil per 100 jin of rapeseed in the third quarter. The oil yield of these two oil crops increased by more than two jin compared to last year. After the Xuzhou Municipal Local State-Owned Vegetable Oil Factory promoted advanced oil extraction operation methods such as "thin, grass-free cake rings" and "combined steaming and baking," the residual oil rate in the dry soybean cake dropped from 6% to 4.1%, and some have already dropped to 3.7%. This factory has increased the production of nearly 300,000 jin of vegetable oil for the state this year. After learning advanced experience, the employees of the Wuxi Municipal Joint State-Private Yulong Oil Mill continuously improved the oil yield and have increased the production of more than 100,000 jin of vegetable oil for the state this year.

According to this newspaper, Zhejiang Province oil mills have increased production of vegetable oil for the state by more than 7,989,000 jin this year. In order to complete the task of increasing oil production, the workers in various factories actively carried out labor competitions with the main contents of increasing oil yield and reducing the residual oil rate in the cake. From January to September this year, the average oil yield per 100 jin of rapeseed in oil mills throughout the province increased by 2.22% compared to the same period last year, and the average oil yield per 100 jin of cottonseed also increased by 0.99% compared to the same period last year. In addition to striving to increase the oil yield, the workers in various factories also actively expanded new oil sources. This year, 77 counties and cities throughout the province have promoted the experience of using cold-pressed soybean cake to make tofu. Various regions used new oil materials to produce oil, increasing the production of 5,050,000 jin of oil for the state.

    江苏浙江两省榨油厂多产油二千多万斤
    新华社二十六日讯　今年全国油料作物丰收，产量约比去年增加百分之二十。现在各地正在收购。成熟期较早的芝麻在九月份就开始上市，安徽、湖北、河南等重点产区十月份进入了收购旺季。河南省信阳专区十月份每日平均收购量比九月份增加近三倍。据中国油脂公司统计：十月上旬全国收购的芝麻达到了第四季度收购计划的百分之十五左右。成熟期较晚的花生也正大量上市。花生产量较大的山东省临沂、胶州两专区已经设立一百五十多个收购点。
    各地在收购油料作物中，贯彻了“多产多得、增产多留”的政策，并且根据优级优价原则，合理地划分了收价等级，照顾了农民的利益。
    新华社南京二十六日电　江苏省二百多个榨油厂今年已经增产了一千六百多万斤植物油。
    全省十六个地方国营榨油厂学习和掌握了李川江先进榨油操作法后，第三季度每百斤花生仁平均能出四十三斤多油；每百斤菜籽平均能出三十五斤多油。这两种油料的出油率都比去年增加了两斤多。徐州市地方国营植物油厂推广“薄型无草饼圈”和“蒸烘合一”等先进榨油操作法后，大豆的干饼残油率由百分之六降到百分之四点一，有的已经降低到百分之三点七。这个厂今年已经为国家增产了近三十万斤植物油。无锡市公私合营裕农油厂的职工们学习了先进经验后，出油率不断提高，今年已经为国家增产了十万多斤植物油。
    本报讯　浙江省各榨油厂今年已经为国家增产植物油七百九十八万九千多斤。各厂职工为了完成增产油的任务，积极开展了以提高出油率、降低饼中残油率为主要内容的劳动竞赛。今年一月到九月，全省各榨油厂每百斤菜籽平均出油率比去年同期提高百分之二点二二，每百斤棉籽平均出油率也比去年同期提高百分之零点九九。各厂的职工，除努力提高出油率以外还积极扩大新油源。全省今年已经有七十七个县、市推广了冷榨大豆豆饼做豆腐的经验。各地利用新油料榨油为国家增产油脂五百零五万斤。
