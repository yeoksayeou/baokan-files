Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 3rd. Cairo dispatch: In a speech delivered at the graduation ceremony of the Egyptian Military Academy on the 2nd, Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser denounced the so-called declaration by the United States, Britain, and France to maintain "equilibrium" and "peace" in the Middle East as a "grand deception to mislead world opinion."

	Nasser said, "Today we hear new, enormous lies and deceptions—the so-called 'balance of power' to maintain peace in the Middle East. This is an attempt to control us even better."

	Nasser reiterated that Egypt would abide by the recent barter agreement with Czechoslovakia to exchange cotton and rice for arms. Nasser said that now we can feel true freedom, liberated from the shackles of the West, and we are able to obtain arms without any attached conditions. He said that French documents obtained by the Egyptian intelligence agencies show that the United States is supplying Israel with many aircraft and tanks.

	Nasser said, "They cannot deceive us. They have armed Israel, while wanting us to always remain weak and under their protection and the protection of their tripartite declaration."

    纳赛尔斥责美英法维持中东“和平”的骗局
    新华社三日讯　开罗消息：埃及总理纳赛尔二日在埃及军事学院毕业典礼上发表的演说中，斥责美、英、法三国的所谓在中东保持“均势”和“和平”的宣言是一个“迷惑世界舆论的大骗局”。
    纳赛尔说，“今天我们听到了新的巨大的谎话和欺骗——所谓为维护中东和平的‘势力均衡’。这是企图更好地控制我们。”
    纳赛尔重申埃及将遵守最近同捷克斯洛伐克签订的以棉花和大米换取军火的换货协定。纳赛尔说，现在我们能感觉到真正的自由，从西方束缚下得到解放，我们已能够得到军火而不受任何附带条件的约束。他说，从埃及情报机关得到的法国文件中可以看出，美国正供给以色列许多飞机和坦克。
    纳赛尔说，“他们骗不过我们。他们武装了以色列，而要我们总是保持孱弱和处在他们的保护和他们的三国宣言的保护之下。”
