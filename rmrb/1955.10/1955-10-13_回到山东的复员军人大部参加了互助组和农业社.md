Most Demobilized Soldiers Returning to Shandong Participate in Mutual Aid Teams and Agricultural Cooperatives

More than 80% of the demobilized construction soldiers returning to rural Shandong Province have participated in mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives, becoming a powerful force in the agricultural cooperation movement. For example, among the 1,578 chairmen and vice-chairmen of agricultural cooperatives in Juancheng County, 364 are demobilized construction soldiers. In Xiliu Township, Cuyang County, five of the six agricultural producers' cooperatives have demobilized construction soldiers as their chairmen. Li Bin, a demobilized construction soldier from Daguanying Village, Yidu Third District, took the lead in organizing a mutual aid team, which was later transformed into an agricultural cooperative. In the cooperative, whether it was on the threshing ground or on the slopes, watering the land or catching insects, he always took the lead, often working until midnight, motivating other members. Everyone worked hard in production, ensuring a bumper harvest of various crops. Seeing the benefits of agricultural cooperatives, the masses in the whole village also asked to join the cooperatives and teams. Li Bin was honorably elected as the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party branch and the chairman of the agricultural producers' cooperative. (Hu Ping)

    回到山东的复员军人大部参加了互助组和农业社
    回到山东省农村的复员建设军人，百分之八十以上都参加了互助组和农业生产合作社，成为农业合作化运动中的一支强大力量。即东全县一千五百七十八个正副农业合作社社长中，复员建设军人就有三百六十四人。徂阳县西柳乡共有六个农业生产合作社，就有五个社的社长是复员建设军人。益都三区大关营村复员建设军人李滨，带头组织了互助组，以后又把互助组转为农业合作社。他在社内不管场上坡下、浇地捕虫，都做在别人头里，往往工作到半夜，带动了其他社员，大家都努力生产，保证了各样庄稼的丰收。全村群众看到农业合作社的好处，也纷纷要求入社入组。李滨光荣地被选为中共支部书记和农业生产合作社社长。（胡平）
