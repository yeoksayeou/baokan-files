Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China received Mr. Mauricio and Mr. Manaw拉克, reporters from the Philippine "Manila Chronicle," on October 23rd and answered the questions they raised. The questions and answers are as follows:

    Question: What is the attitude of the People's Republic of China towards its neighbor, the Republic of the Philippines? What are the possibilities for the People's Republic of China to cooperate and work together with the Republic of the Philippines for world peace?

    Answer: The Chinese people are friendly to the Filipino people. The People's Republic of China is willing to coexist peacefully with the Republic of the Philippines. As long as our two countries no longer allow external forces to create rifts and suspicions between us, there is no reason why China and the Philippines cannot coexist peacefully, cooperate friendly, and make a joint contribution to world peace.

    Question: Once the People's Republic of China finally liberates Taiwan, is there any reason for the Philippines to worry about being drawn into any activity that disrupts peace?

    Answer: Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory, Taiwan, should not cause concern to any other country. The Chinese people have always loved peace and opposed aggression. The Chinese people have suffered the pain of being invaded themselves, so they will not invade others. What really needs to be guarded against is being drawn into any activity that disrupts peace due to obligations assumed in opposing military blocs.

    Question: What is the attitude of the People's Republic of China towards Chinese nationals residing in the Philippines?

    Answer: The People's Republic of China is very concerned about Chinese nationals residing in the Philippines. We hope that their legitimate rights and interests will be respected and protected. We are also willing to encourage them to respect the laws of their country of residence and the customs of society. Among the overseas Chinese in the Philippines, there is also the issue of dual nationality. The treaty on the issue of dual nationality signed between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia illustrates the Chinese government's policy and attitude in resolving this issue.

    Question: Does Premier Zhou have anything to convey to the Filipino people on behalf of the Chinese people?

    Answer: I would like to extend my greetings to the Filipino people on behalf of the Chinese people. Government personnel from our two countries had friendly contacts during the Asian-African Conference. This visit to China by Mr. Mauricio and Mr. Manaw拉克 of the "Manila Chronicle" has also brought the people of our two countries into contact. We would like to see such contacts between government personnel and between the people of our two countries become more frequent. This will play an important role in enhancing the friendship between our two peoples and improving relations between our two countries.

    周恩来总理答菲律宾记者问
    新华社二十九日讯　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来在十月二十三日接见了菲律宾“马尼拉纪事报”记者莫里西奥先生和曼那劳克先生，对他们所提出的问题作了答复。问题和答复如下：
    问：中华人民共和国对它的邻国菲律宾共和国抱什么态度？中华人民共和国为了世界和平同菲律宾共和国进行合作和共同努力的可能性如何？
    答：中国人民对菲律宾人民是友好的。中华人民共和国愿意同菲律宾共和国和平相处。只要我们两国不再容许外来的势力在我们两国之间制造隔阂和疑虑，中、菲两国没有理由不能和平相处、友好合作并且为世界和平作出共同的贡献。
    问：一旦中华人民共和国终于解放台湾，菲律宾是否有任何理由要担心被卷入任何破坏和平的活动？
    答：台湾是中国的领土，中国人民解放自己的领土台湾不应该引起任何别的国家担心。中国人民一向爱好和平，反对侵略。中国人民自己受过被人侵略的痛苦，就更不会去侵略别人。真正需要警惕的，倒是不要由于在对立性军事集团中所承担的义务而被卷入任何破坏和平的活动。
    问：中华人民共和国对住在菲律宾的中国侨民抱什么态度？
    答：中华人民共和国对住在菲律宾的中国侨民非常关怀。我们希望，他们的正当权益得到尊重和保护。我们也愿意勉励他们尊重侨居国政府的法律和社会的习惯。在菲律宾的华侨中，也存在双重国籍的问题。中华人民共和国同印度尼西亚共和国签订的关于双重国籍问题的条约，说明了中国政府解决这个问题的政策和态度。
    问：周总理代表中国人民是否有什么话要转达菲律宾人民？
    答：我愿意代表中国人民向菲律宾人民致意。我们两国政府人员在亚非会议期间曾经有过友好的接触。这次“马尼拉纪事报”的莫里西奥先生和曼那劳克先生来中国访问，使我们两国的人民也有了接触。我们愿意看到我们两国政府人员之间和两国人民之间的这种接触更加频繁起来。这对于增进我们两国人民的友谊和改进我们两国的关系将会起重要的作用。
