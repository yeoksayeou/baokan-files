China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Albania, and the German Democratic Republic have now formed a powerful international railway through transport network. This year, China's imports and exports through the railway through transport network will increase by 88 percent compared to 1952. This will greatly promote economic and cultural cooperation between China and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.

In order to strengthen international through transport work, China's railway departments have added many stations to handle through transport procedures in recent years. Whether it is exported or imported goods, only one consignment procedure needs to be completed at the departure station, and one freight charge needs to be paid to directly transport the goods to the destination, and the railway freight rates of each transit country are unified. In order to ensure the rapid transportation of import and export goods, the railway department always gives priority to import and export goods in the transportation plan. In addition, the railway department has also added many refrigerated cars, insulated cars and large vehicles to ensure the quality of the goods, so now bananas and oranges produced in Guangdong, China can be transported to Moscow without spoiling.

In terms of passenger transportation, there are direct passenger trains between Beijing and Moscow, Beijing and Hanoi, and Beijing and Pyongyang.

    我国和苏联及人民民主国家实行铁路联运
    现在中国和苏联、朝鲜、越南、蒙古、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰、阿尔巴尼亚、德意志民主共和国之间已经组成一个强大的国际铁路联运网。今年我国通过铁路联运网进口和出口的物资，将比一九五二年增长百分之八十八。这就大大促进了中国和苏联及各人民民主国家之间的经济和文化的合作。
    我国铁路部门为了加强国际联运工作，这几年在国内增设了很多办理联运手续的车站。不论是出口的货物或进口的货物都只要在发货车站办理一次托运手续，缴付一次运费便可以直接运到目的地，而且各个过境国家的铁路运价都是统一的。为了保证进出口货物迅速运输，铁路部门总是优先把进出口货物列入运输计划。另外，铁路部门还添置了许多冷藏车、保温车和大型车辆来保证货物的质量，所以现在中国广东出产的香蕉和橘子可以运到莫斯科也不变坏。
    在旅客运输方面，北京到莫斯科、北京到河内、北京到平壤之间都有直达旅客列车。
