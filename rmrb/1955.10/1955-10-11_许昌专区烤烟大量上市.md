    Large Quantities of Flue-Cured Tobacco from Xuchang Prefecture Enter the Market
    The nationally famous flue-cured tobacco producing area – Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province – has seen large quantities of its tobacco enter the market. Since mid-August, the average daily amount of tobacco entering the market has been over one million jin. The Xuchang Tobacco Company and the supply and marketing cooperatives are vigorously carrying out purchases.
    This year, the early tobacco in Xuchang Prefecture is growing well. The cured tobacco leaves are golden and bright, and contain sufficient oil.
    Due to the large amount of tobacco entering the market, the local market is becoming more active. The sales of Xuchang Department Store in late August rose sharply. Now, there is a constant stream of tobacco farmers going to state-owned and private shops to buy the goods they need. (Guang Xi)

    许昌专区烤烟大量上市
    全国著名的烤烟产区——河南省许昌专区的烤烟已经大量上市，八月中旬以后，每天平均上市的烤烟在一百万斤以上。许昌烟草公司和供销合作社正在大力进行收购。
    今年许昌专区的早烟生长良好。烤出来的烟叶金黄鲜明，并含有足够的油水。
    由于烟叶大量上市，当地市场更加活跃。许昌市百货公司八月下旬的销售额急剧上升。现在，每天都有川流不息的烟农到公私营商店去购买自己需要的货物。　（广锡）
