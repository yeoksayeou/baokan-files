Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, 7th. According to TASS, Belgrade, 7th: On the tenth anniversary of the founding of the "People's Army" newspaper, Yugoslav President Tito answered some questions posed to him by the newspaper's reporters.

Speaking about the issue of disarmament, Tito said: In resolving the issue of disarmament, one must not insist on solving a certain problem first and then solving another. These issues should be resolved simultaneously so that some agreement can be reached on the general principles that should be followed in implementing disarmament.

Tito said: The Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission has achieved some successes, especially after the Soviet Union proposed a suggestion on May 10 this year, which greatly narrowed the differences between the Soviet position and the positions of Western countries. Tito said: The very constructive, detailed, and clearly worded Soviet proposal, together with the Anglo-French proposal, is a broad basis for the four major powers to conduct disarmament negotiations smoothly. I believe that the overall development has reached such a point that no particular difficulties will arise in the disarmament issue at present. The essence of the matter is to break the deadlock on this issue. Further achievements in this issue will largely depend on the foreign ministers' meeting to be held in Geneva at the end of this month.

Tito then said: The contacts between the United States and the Soviet Union to resolve the following issues have given everyone new hope. These issues are: Eisenhower's proposal on exchanging intelligence and conducting aerial photography of military targets and Bulganin's counter-proposal. I believe that Bulganin's proposal is completely correct because it would be absurd to hope that the Soviet Union would agree to unilaterally exchange intelligence and conduct aerial photography without the possibility of understanding the military bases of the countries around it. I believe that Eisenhower's proposal is sincere, but this proposal still needs to be further processed through consultation. And the main thing is: the United States and the Soviet Union should reach an agreement on this issue.

Tito pointed out that the upcoming Geneva conference will be of great significance in terms of the methods and ways to resolve those issues that threaten peace. Tito believes that the United Nations should resolve the issue of prohibiting the use of atomic weapons.

    南斯拉夫总统铁托谈裁军问题
    新华社七日讯　据塔斯社贝尔格莱德七日讯：在“人民军队”报创刊十周年时，南斯拉夫总统铁托回答了这家报纸的记者向他提出的一些问题。
    铁托谈到裁军问题时说：在解决裁军问题时绝不能硬主张首先应该解决某个问题，然后再解决另外一个问题。这些问题应该同时解决，这样才可以就实行裁军所应该遵循的一般原则达成某些协议。
    铁托说：联合国裁军委员会小组委员会已经取得了一些成就，特别是在今年五月十日苏联提出建议以后，这个建议在很大程度上缩小了苏联立场和西方国家立场的分歧。铁托说：非常富有建设性的、详细的和措辞明确的苏联建议连同英法的建议一起是四大国顺利进行裁军谈判的广泛基础。我认为总的发展情况已达到这样的程度，目前在裁军问题上不会产生特别的困难。问题的实质就是要在这个问题上打开僵局。在这个问题上要取得进一步的成就，在很大程度上取决于本月底在日内瓦举行的外长会议。
    铁托接着说：美国同苏联为解决下列问题而进行的接触使大家产生新的希望，这些问题就是：艾森豪威尔提出的关于交换情报和对军事目标进行空中摄影的建议和布尔加宁提出的反建议。我认为：布尔加宁的建议是完全正确的，因为，如果希望苏联同意片面地交换情报和空中摄影，而没有可能来了解它周围的国家的那些军事基地，那是荒谬的。我相信，艾森豪威尔的建议是诚恳的，但是，这个建议还有待于大家协商进一步加工。而主要的是：美国同苏联应当在这一问题上达成协议。
    铁托指出，即将举行的日内瓦会议在那些威胁和平的问题的解决方法和方式上将取得怎样的成就，是有重要的意义的。铁托认为，联合国应该解决禁止使用原子武器的问题。
