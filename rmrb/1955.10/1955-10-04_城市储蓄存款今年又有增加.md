    Urban Savings Deposits Increase Again This Year
    According to recent statistics from the People's Bank of China, urban savings deposits increased by 12 percent by the end of August this year compared to the end of 1954, reaching a total of over 1.44 billion yuan. According to statistics from 24 provinces and cities, the number of savings accounts reached 13.6 million by the end of June. The number of savings accounts in the seven major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an increased by 3.8 times compared to the same period last year. Among the various types of savings, fixed deposits have increased the fastest, and most deposits are now fixed deposits. The average deposit period for various savings has also been extended compared to the past.
    With the improvement of people's living standards, savings deposits have been increasing year by year. By the end of 1953, the total amount of urban savings deposits nationwide had increased more than seven times compared to the end of 1950. In 1954, although the broad masses of workers purchased 240 million yuan of national economic construction bonds, urban savings deposits still increased by 18 percent compared to the end of 1953.

    城市储蓄存款今年又有增加
    据中国人民银行最近统计，今年到八月底止，城市储蓄存款比一九五四年底增加百分之十二，总额达到十四亿四千多万元。据二十四个省市的统计，储蓄的户数在六月底就达到了一千三百六十万户，北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州、重庆、西安七大城市的储蓄户数比去年同期增加三点八倍。各种储蓄种类中，定期储蓄上升最快，现在大部分存款是定期储蓄。各种储蓄的平均存期也比过去延长了。
    随着人民生活水平的提高，储蓄存款也一年比一年增多。一九五三年底全国城市储蓄存款总额比一九五○年底增加七倍多；一九五四年，广大职工虽然认购了国家经济建设公债二亿四千万元，但城市储蓄存款还是比一九五三年底增加百分之十八。
