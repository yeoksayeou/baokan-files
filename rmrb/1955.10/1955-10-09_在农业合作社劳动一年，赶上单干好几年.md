After working in the Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhongxing Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province for a year, the recent autumn harvest estimated production and pre-distribution showed brilliant results in both agricultural and sideline production, and the income of the co-op members increased significantly. The total output of grain and cash crops on the cooperative's 39.95 hectares of land was equivalent to 349,830 jin of sorghum. The total income from agriculture and sideline occupations was 534,460 jin of sorghum. After deducting land and livestock rent, and retaining public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and all management expenses, each labor day can be distributed an average of 81.6 jin of sorghum. The income of the co-op members has increased from one to several times compared to before joining the co-op. The co-op member Ji Chunyi has a family of five, with two laborers. He contributed 1.17 hectares of land and an ox to the co-op. He and his son worked a total of 330 labor days. Adding land remuneration and ox rental to his labor day income, after deducting the public grain to be handed over, he had a net surplus of 24,510 jin of grain. Last year, he produced in a mutual aid team, farming 1.1 hectares of land himself and harvesting 3,600 jin of grain. Adding the 70 yuan ox rental he got back from the team, his total income was 5,725 jin of sorghum. After deducting public grain and livestock fodder, he only had 4,425 jin left. This amount was not even the odd change of this year's income. This year's income has increased more than four times compared to last year. Co-op member Yan Zhongyu has a family of five, with one laborer. Last year, he farmed 1.29 hectares of land himself and harvested 5,400 jin of grain. After deducting 1,220 jin of public grain and 400 jin of ox rent, he had a net surplus of 3,780 jin. All living expenses depended on this grain, and life was tight. He couldn't turn things around for many years. But this year is very different. He worked a total of 120 labor days, and adding land remuneration, he had a net surplus of 8,800 jin of grain, an increase of more than double compared to last year.

The newly established agricultural cooperative has such a large income of grain, and the co-op members are all smiling and beaming with joy. At the pre-distribution meeting, everyone said: "One year of labor in a cooperative is worth several years of working on your own. Agricultural cooperatives are really good!"

Such great achievements in production are the result of the unity of all members and the superiority of collective labor. The co-op director Zang Defu said: "This year we fought several battles in production. We won one battle, and production improved one step. We won every battle, and production greatly improved." In June last year, when the co-op was just established, the situation was as follows: the co-op members had empty family fortunes and little investment, lacking 8,000 jin of feed, 3,000 jin of bean cake, and 3,200 jin of seeds. At that time, the co-op management committee members were very worried. They thought: these things really cost a lot of money to buy. If they can't be solved, there will be no production next year. What's the use of just setting up a co-op framework? But they also thought that there is strength in numbers and that there is always a way when organized. After research, everyone agreed that there were eight or nine months from now until next year's (this year's) spring plowing. If everyone can work hard and twist the eight strands of rope together, they can immediately find sideline occupations in many ways, get more income, and all problems can be solved. Then, the co-op director Zang Defu and the production committee member went to Xitzigou to find a yellow grass marsh. The two of them estimated that based on the condition of this grass marsh, half of the co-op's labor force would be enough to cut for one or two months. Selling these yellow grasses would bring in some money. So, they signed a contract with the local supply and marketing cooperative and immediately organized twenty-one people to work. But things didn't go so smoothly. The co-op members complained that the field was not good and the grass was sparse. They couldn't cut much and wouldn't earn much money. So, some cut for half a day, and some only cut four or five bundles before stopping. Facing this situation, the co-op director Zang Defu was very anxious. He had no choice but to go to the Party General Branch Committee to ask the General Branch Secretary for instructions. The General Branch Secretary pointed out some specific methods to him and then sent someone to help. They first conducted ideological education for the co-op members, reversing the co-op members' unwillingness to endure hardship through organizing everyone to calculate detailed accounts and discussions. Then, they divided the people drawn to cut grass into two teams and implemented contracted work. The members of each team were also divided, some cutting and some pulling. As a result, they cut more than 7,700 bundles of yellow grass in one month. After the autumn harvest, they organized the remaining labor force at home to contract plastering walls, digging kang (traditional Chinese bed-stove), and repairing houses for the Zhongxing Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative, schools, and health centers. They also signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative, and the co-op's four carts were dedicated to transporting goods and delivering grain for the supply and marketing cooperative. At the same time, according to the conditions of the broad honey source in the mountainous area and the beekeeping technology in the co-op, they operated 53 hives of bees. This year, the bees obtained an unprecedented bumper harvest, collecting a total of 4,300 jin of honey. The wider the sideline occupations, the more the income, and the more motivated the co-op members became. The co-op's sideline income reached 7,385 yuan throughout the year. In this way, the problems of seeds and fodder were completely solved, the daily living difficulties of the co-op members were overcome, and the co-op members became more active in production.

Another aspect of this agricultural cooperative is that there is little land and many people, and there is not enough work to do. The co-op has 27 households, 42 male laborers, 21 female laborers, and 142 people, but only 39.95 hectares of land, an average of just over 9.4 mu of land per laborer. There is no place to reclaim wasteland in this area. The co-op director Zang Defu thought: The purpose of running a co-op is to fully utilize labor efficiency, produce more grain, not only enough for our own use, but also to sell more to the state and get more income. But the whole co-op only has so much land, how can this be achieved? In order to solve this problem, the management committee studied it several times, and the final solution was to change dry land into paddy fields and tap production potential. This opinion was discussed and agreed by the co-op members, and with the specific guidance of the higher authorities, a plan was made to convert dry land into paddy fields: all 17 hectares of flat land at the foot of the mountain would be converted into paddy fields, to be completed in three years, converting 5 hectares in the first year, 5 hectares in the second year, and completing all in the third year. During the slack season last year, they began construction in conjunction with sideline production, digging moats to divert water to irrigate the fields in preparation for planting rice. Many people around believed that this could not be done. Some said: "That's not like eating sesame cakes. Even if the land can be converted, the land is high and the river is low. How can water be drawn upwards?" However, the agricultural cooperative was not stopped by difficulties. There are many people and many methods. After everyone's research, it was decided to dig the moat around the bottom of the mountain, so that it would be easy to draw water. When digging the moat, 28 laborers were divided into four groups to carry out competitions, one group catching up with the other, comparing with each other. In half a month, all the big moats and small canals were dug. Waiting for the spring plowing of the second year (this year), they could release water to irrigate the fields. When this year's preparatory work began, all the work was rushed together: harrowing, sending manure, and planing weeds had to be carried out at the same time, and the work of converting the paddy fields had to be completed. The labor force was not surplus but felt insufficient. At this time, some co-op members wavered about the plan to convert the paddy fields. They said: Good days are not sought at once, but must be a steady stream. The co-op director Zang Defu insisted on completing the work of converting the paddy fields and tried to improve the labor organization, and everyone's confidence was restored. Under the concerted efforts of all the co-op members, finally, all the work was completed on time. At the co-op members' meeting to conclude spring plowing and deploy summer hoeing, the co-op director Zang Defu summarized the superiority of collective production. He said: This year's spring plowing work has been completed, and 5.1 mu of paddy fields have been converted and planted with rice. All the dry land is being tended like embroidery. During the preparation for plowing, four carts were pulling manure to the fields, all the way to sowing. More than 1,900 carts of manure were pulled to the fields, an average of more than 50 carts per hectare, more than 70 carts on 5.5 hectares of high-yield land, and the most on the two hectares of corn, with 92 carts.

This meeting greatly increased the production enthusiasm of the co-op members. During the summer hoeing, the fields were hoed very carefully. Because the crops were well tended, this year's harvest was unprecedented. Take a few major crops as an example: the newly converted 5.1 mu of paddy fields yielded an average of 9,310 jin per hectare; the 11 hectares of corn yielded an average of 5,200 jin per hectare; and the 6 hectares of beans yielded an average of 3,200 jin per hectare. The average yield of the whole co-op increased by more than 1,100 jin per hectare compared to the mutual aid group last year.

    在农业合作社劳动一年，赶上单干好几年
    王恩贵　唐保山
    吉林省蛟河县中兴村友谊农业生产合作社最近进行了一次秋收估产预分，结果是农、副业生产都得到了辉煌的成果，社员收入大大增加。全社三十九垧九亩五分地的粮食和经济作物的产量，折成高粱共有三十四万九千八百三十斤。农副业两项共收入高粱五十三万四千四百六十斤。除掉土地、牲畜租额，应留公积金、公益金和一切管理费用，每个劳动日平均可分得八十一斤六两高粱。社员的收入比入社前增加一倍到数倍。社员纪春义五口人，两个劳动力，入社土地一垧一亩七分，牛一头租给社，他和儿子共做了三百三十个劳动日。劳动日收入加上土地报酬和耕牛租金，除去应缴公粮，净剩二万四千五百一十斤粮食。他去年在互助组生产，自己种一垧一亩地，打了三千六百斤粮食，加上在组里找回来七十元的耕牛租钱，一共收入了五千七百二十五斤高粱。除掉公粮和牲口草料，只剩四千四百二十五斤。这点粮还赶不上今年收入的零数。今年收入比去年增加了四倍多。社员阎忠玉，五口人，一个劳动力。去年自己种了一垧二亩九分地，打了五千四百斤粮，去掉一千二百二十斤公粮和四百斤牛租，净剩三千七百八十斤。生活上一切花消都靠这点粮食，日子过得紧帮帮的，多少年了总翻不过来。可是今年大不同了，他一共做了一百二十个劳动日，加上土地报酬，净剩八千八百斤粮，收入比去年增加了一倍多。
    新成立的农业合作社收入了这么多的粮食，社员们个个眉开眼笑，喜气洋洋。在预分大会上大家都说：“在合作社劳动一年，赶上自个干好几年。农业社真是个好！”
    生产上作出这样大的成绩，是全体社员团结一心、发挥集体劳动的优越性的结果。社主任臧德富说：“今年俺们打了好几个生产仗，打胜了一仗，生产提高了一步，仗仗都见胜了，生产也就大大提高了。”在去年六月社刚建起来的时候，是这样一个情况：社员们家底空、投资少。缺八千斤饲草，三千斤豆饼，三千二百多斤种子。当时社管理委员们很发愁，他们想：这些东西真得一大笔钱来买呀，如果解决不了，来年就无法生产，光搭起个社的架子有什么用啊！但他们又想，人多力量大，组织起来了总是有办法。经过研究，大家一致认为：从现在起到来年（今年）春耕还有八、九个月的时间，若是大家都能使劲、八股绳往一块拧，马上从多方面找副业门路，多得一些收入，啥问题都解决得了。接着，社主任臧德富和生产委员到西茨沟找到了一片黄草塘。他们两人估计：根据这块草塘的情况，全社抽出一半劳力，足够割一、二个月。割了这些黄草，就可卖一笔钱。于是，他们就同当地供销合作社签订了合同，并立刻组织二十一个人干起来了。可是事情并不是那样顺利的。社员嫌场子不好、草稀，割不出数来，挣不了多少钱。于是有的割半天，有的只割了四、五捆就不割了。面对这个情况，社主任臧德富很着急；没有办法，他便到党总支委员会去向总支书记请示。总支书记指点给他一些具体办法，随后又派人去帮助。他们首先对社员进行思想教育，通过组织大伙算细账、讨论等办法，扭转了社员不愿吃苦的思想。接着把抽出割草的人分成两个队，实行包工干活。每个队的队员又分了工，割的割，拉的拉。结果一个月工夫就割了七千七百多捆黄草。秋收后，又组织剩下在家的那部分劳力到中兴村供销社、学校、卫生所包揽抹墙、掏炕、修理房屋等工作。又同供销社订了合同，社内的四辆大车专门给供销社运货、送粮。同时又根据山区蜜源广和社内有养蜂技术的条件，经营了五十三箱蜜蜂。今年蜜蜂获得了从来没有过的丰收，一共采了四千三百斤蜜。副业门路越广，收入越多，社员们越干越有劲。全社一年来副业收入达七千三百八十五元。这样籽种、草料等问题就完全解决了，社员们日常的生活困难也克服了，社员生产更加积极。
    这个农业合作社另一方面的情况是地少人多，活计不够干。全社二十七户人家，四十二个男劳动力，二十一个女劳动力，一百四十二口人，才三十九垧九亩五分地，平均每个劳动力只种九亩四分多地。这个地方又没处开荒。社主任臧德富想：办社的目的是为了充分发挥劳动效力，多打粮食，不但自己够用，还要多多卖给国家，多得收入。可是全社就这么点地，怎么能做到这一点呢？为了解决这个问题，管理委员会研究了好几次，最后解决办法是：改旱地为水田，发挥生产潜力。这一意见经社员讨论同意，又得到上级机关的具体指导，便作出了旱地改水田的计划：山下十七垧平地都改成水田，分三年完成，头一年改五垧、第二年改五垧、第三年全部完成。去年挂锄期间，便结合副业生产开始动工，挖濠引水灌田准备种稻。对这件事，周围许多群众都认为做不到。有的说：“那可不是吃烧饼哪，就算地能改，可是地高河低，水怎么能往上引？”可是，农业合作社没被困难挡住，人多办法也多，经过大伙研究，决定把濠绕到山根底下去挖，这样就好引水了。挖濠时，二十八个劳动力，分成四帮开展了竞赛，一帮赶一帮，互相比着，半个月的工夫，就把大濠和小渠道全部挖好了。只等第二年（今年）春耕到来，就可以放水灌田了。今年备耕工作开始，什么活计都赶到一起了：耢地、送粪、刨槎子都要同时进行，又要完成改水田的工作，劳力不是多余而是感到不够用了。这时，有的社员对改水田的计划发生了动摇，他们说：好日子不是一下子谋来的，得细水长流。社主任臧德富坚持完成改水田的工作，并设法改善了劳动组织，大家的信心又足了。在全体社员一致努力之下，最后，所有活计都按时做完了。在结束春耕布置夏锄的社员大会上，社主任臧德富总结了集体生产的优越性，他说：今年春耕活计都干出来了，改了五垧一亩水田、栽上了水稻。所有的旱地侍弄得像绣花一样。在备耕时，四台大车往地里拉粪，足足拉到播种。一千九百多车粪都拉到地里去了，平均每垧五十多车，五垧半丰产地上了七十多车，最多的那两垧玉米上了九十二车。
    这次会大大提高了社员们的生产积极性，夏锄时，地铲?得非常细致。由于庄稼侍弄得好，今年获得了从来没有过的丰收。就拿几种主要作物来说吧：新改的五垧一亩水田，每垧平均产九千三百
  一十斤；十一垧玉米平均每垧产五千二百斤；六垧豆子平均每垧产三千二百斤。全社平均产量比去年互助组时每垧增产一千一百多斤。
