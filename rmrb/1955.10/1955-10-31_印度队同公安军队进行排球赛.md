    印度队同公安军队进行排球赛
    印度国家排球队同我国公安军排球队二十九日晚举行了来我国后的第三次友谊赛。
    球赛是在北京体育馆中进行的。到场的观众有六千多人。比赛结果，公安军队以三比二获胜。
    在第一局比赛的最初几分钟内，印度队连扣硬球，曾以六比二领先。公安军队暂停商量对策以后开始反攻。追到七平以后，双方曾争夺了八次发球权。后来公安军队展开猛攻，最后以十五比十二先胜。
    第二局战斗更形激烈。双方曾打成三平、五平、七平和八平的紧张局面。但后来印度队几次扣球出界，公安军队以十五比八再胜。
    第三局和第四局，公安军队最初都曾一度领先，但后来因为发球和扣球失误较多，结果都以十比十五失败。
    休息以后，决定胜负的最后一局比赛开始了。这一局双方每得一分都要经过激烈的争夺。印度队以强硬的扣球称著的曼库和乔普拉都很活跃，观众不时为他们的出色表演热烈鼓掌。公安军队这一局多用“拉开”和“交叉掩护”等战术，先转移对方封网的注意力，然后由空挡扣球得分。比赛到最后，公安军队以十五比十一获胜。　（新华社）
