The United States Tries to Destroy the Geneva Spirit
Jiang Yuanchun

Just as the whole world hopes that the upcoming four-power foreign ministers' meeting can further ease the international situation, the United States is simultaneously flaunting atomic weapons and threats of force in Asia and Europe, creating a tense atmosphere.

After disregarding the opposition of the Japanese people and transporting atomic rocket launchers to Japan, the United States is instigating Japan to actively engage in preparations for atomic military power. Sunada, Director-General of the Japanese "Defense Agency," stated on the 13th that he hoped to "lease" some atomic rockets from the United States for "research and experimentation." According to an Associated Press report, authoritative sources at the Pentagon immediately stated that if Japan "cultivated trained personnel" to master such weapons, then this would not be "excluded from future plans." Obviously, the U.S. aims to use the guise of Japan conducting its own "research and experimentation" to deceive the Japanese people, so that it can equip the revived Japanese militarism with atomic weapons and turn Japan into a U.S. atomic war base. This action taken by the Japanese government, subjugated to U.S. control, to cater to U.S. demands, is primarily severely detrimental to the Japanese people.

On the same day that Sunada announced his hope to "lease" atomic weapons from the United States, the U.S. Eighth Army in South Korea announced that a group of U.S. officers had arrived in South Korea to train Rhee Syngman's army officers in atomic warfare. This draws attention to an article by Robert Allen published in the "New York Post" on August 1st. This article stated that the "real destination is Korea" for the atomic cannons that the United States has already transported to Okinawa.

Also on the 13th, over 100,000 U.S. and French troops began an atomic war exercise in West Germany. This exercise will continue until October 17th. Two days prior, the first group of U.S. atomic artillery units, originally stationed in West Germany, arrived in Italy.

What exactly is the reason for the United States simultaneously flaunting atomic military threats in Asia and Europe on almost the same day?

As can be seen from a report by New York Times reporter Reston on October 10, the United States is afraid of the impact of the international situation tending towards easing and is "devaluing" the "Geneva spirit." At this moment, on October 12, U.S. Air Force Secretary Quarles openly clamored that the United States must "maintain a decisive retaliatory force" and use the "threat of nuclear annihilation" to "create a stalemate resulting from deterrence," which supposedly is where the U.S.'s "greatest hope for peace lies." In other words, the Geneva spirit is definitely not what the U.S. needs.

This situation shows that there is a force in the United States that is trying to destroy the Geneva spirit and salvage its "policy of strength" in order to maintain international tension and obstruct the four-power foreign ministers' meeting from achieving success. Simultaneously flaunting atomic military power in Asia and Europe is clearly part of this sabotage activity. Similarly belonging to this sabotage activity is the so-called largest army and air force exercise since World War II recently announced by the U.S. Department of Defense.

However, the Geneva four-power summit has already proven that the "policy of strength" can only lead to bankruptcy, and the Geneva spirit that emerged from it has taken deep root in people's hearts, becoming the firm belief and goal of peace-loving countries and people. It originates from the people's vital needs and is something that is growing and cannot be destroyed. No threat can frustrate the efforts and confidence of people of all countries to struggle for the realization of the Geneva spirit. The U.S.'s atomic military threat can only make more and more peace-loving people around the world see more clearly where the countercurrent obstructing the easing of the situation comes from. They will therefore know better how to fight to defend and realize the Geneva spirit.

    美国力图摧毁日内瓦精神
    蒋元椿
    正当全世界希望将要举行的四国外长会议能够使国际局势进一步缓和的时候，美国却在亚洲和欧洲同时炫耀原子武力和武力威胁，制造紧张气氛。
    美国在不顾日本人民的反对，把原子火箭炮运到日本以后，又在唆使日本积极从事原子军力的准备。日本“防卫厅”长官砂田在十三日表示希望能从美国“租借”到一些原子火箭来进行“研究和试验”。据美联社报道，五角大楼的权威人士立刻表示，如果由日本“培养受过训练的人员”来掌握这种武器的话，那末这是不会被“排斥在将来的计划之外”的。很明显，美国的目的是想用日本自己进行“研究和试验”的伪装来麻痹日本人民，以便它用原子武器来装备复活的日本军国主义，把日本变成美国的原子战争基地。屈服在美国控制下的日本政府为迎合美国的要求而采取的这种行动，首先是对日本人民严重不利的。
    就在砂田宣布希望向美国“租借”原子武器的这一天，在南朝鲜的美国第八军宣布，一批美国军官已经到达南朝鲜，对李承晚的陆军军官进行原子战争的训练。这使人们注意到“纽约邮报”在八月一日刊载的罗伯特·艾伦的一篇文章。这篇文章说，美国已经运到冲绳岛的原子大炮的“真正目的地是朝鲜”。
    同样是在十三日这一天，十万以上的美国和法国的部队在西德开始了一次原子战争演习。这次演习将继续到十月十七日。在此以前两天，第一批原驻在西德的美国原子炮部队到达了意大利。
    美国几乎是在同一天，在亚洲和欧洲同时炫耀原子武力威胁，究竟是为了什么呢？
    从纽约时报记者赖斯顿十月十日的报道中可以看出，美国害怕国际局势趋于缓和的影响，正在“把日内瓦精神”“予以贬价”。正在这时候，十月十二日美国空军部长卡利斯公然叫嚷美国要“保持断然的报复力量”，要用“核子毁灭的威胁”来“造成一种由于威慑力量而产生的僵持局面”，而这种局面据说就是美国“对和平的最大希望之所在”。换句话说，日内瓦精神决不是美国所需要的。
    这种情况说明，美国正有一种势力在力图摧毁日内瓦精神，挽救它的“实力政策”，以便保持国际紧张局势，阻挠四国外长会议取得成就。在亚洲和欧洲同时炫耀原子武力，显然就是这种破坏活动的一部分。同样属于这种破坏活动的事情，就是美国国防部最近宣布的所谓第二次大战以来最大的陆空军演习。
    但是日内瓦四国政府首脑会议已经证明“实力政策”只有走向破产，从那里产生的日内瓦精神已经深入人心，成了爱好和平的国家和人民的坚定信念和努力目标。它从人民的切身需要产生，是正在生长的东西，是不可能摧毁的。任何威胁都不能挫折各国人民为实现日内瓦精神而斗争的努力和信心。美国的原子武力威胁只能使越来越多的世界爱好和平人民看得更清楚：阻挠局势缓和的逆流是从哪里来的。他们因此就更知道应该怎样为保卫和实现日内瓦精神而斗争。
