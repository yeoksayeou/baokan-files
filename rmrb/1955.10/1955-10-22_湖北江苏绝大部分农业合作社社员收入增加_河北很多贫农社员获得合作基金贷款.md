Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 20th: Agricultural producers' cooperatives in Hubei Province, numbering more than 14,000, conscientiously implemented the principle of mutual benefit during the autumn harvest distribution. Among the more than 12,000 cooperatives across the province that achieved increased production, approximately 95% of the members increased their income. According to a survey and statistics conducted by the Rural Work Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on 91,241 households in 4,511 cooperatives, 86,536 households increased their income.

The implementation of the principle of mutual benefit in distribution has greatly promoted the consolidation and development of agricultural producers' cooperatives. Zhu Qiming, a member of the Fifth Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangci Township, Xishui County, had a field that consistently yielded ten *shi* of rice annually, but it was only assessed at eight *shi* when he joined the cooperative, leading to ideological wavering and passive production, and he frequently proposed withdrawing from the cooperative. After adjustments were made this time, he worked diligently from dawn till dusk, cheerfully, and no longer mentioned withdrawing. Chen Shikui, a middle peasant who had withdrawn from the Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative in Echeng County, applied to rejoin the cooperative after seeing that the members' households had increased their income. Previously, many farmers outside the cooperatives held a wait-and-see attitude, saying, "Whether to build or not, let's see after the autumn harvest." This time, seeing that the cooperative implemented the principle of mutual benefit and that the majority of members increased their income, they have been actively requesting to join or establish cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: The 35,700-plus agricultural producers' cooperatives established in Jiangsu Province before this spring are now distributing this year's income. According to surveys, 841 cooperatives in Huaiyin County, northern Jiangsu, had better harvests this year than last year, and 837 cooperatives had better harvests this year than local mutual aid teams and individual farmers. Among the more than 16,200 cooperative member households in the county that have already undergone income distribution, more than 13,600 households have increased their income compared to before joining the cooperative, and more than 1,600 households have basically the same income as last year. Trial calculations for 115 cooperatives in four districts of Chuansha County showed that about 94% of the members increased their income compared to before joining the cooperative. Among the 637 cooperatives in Nanhui, Qingpu, Jiading, and Songjiang counties, there were originally 945 member households who were concerned that their actual income would not be as high as farming individually, and their thinking was wavering; after the trial distribution, they became stable.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 20th: Many poor farmers participating in agricultural producers' cooperatives in Hebei Province have received cooperative fund loans for poor farmers issued by the state banks. According to statistics from 57 counties in the four special districts of Tangshan, Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Cangxian, more than 22,700 agricultural producers' cooperatives, comprising more than 130,000 poor farmer member households, have received this loan.

With the support of these loans, agricultural producers' cooperatives have been further consolidated. The Xiaoluzhai Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yanshan County originally had 55 households. Because poor farmers were unable to invest, and middle peasants felt they were at a disadvantage, 33 middle peasant households withdrew from the cooperative after the wheat harvest, leaving 20 poor peasant households and two new middle peasant households, with only six head of livestock to cultivate 320 *mu* of land. Production was facing difficulties. Later, this cooperative received a 450 *yuan* cooperative fund loan for poor farmers, purchased five draught animals, two carts, and two weeding hoes. The enthusiasm of the members greatly increased, and four of the original middle peasant households who had withdrawn requested to return to the cooperative. After two poor farmer households in the Baihu Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the fourth district of Renqiu County received loans, four middle peasant households were influenced to invest 145 *yuan* to buy one cow and three pigs, and the members launched a competition.

    湖北江苏绝大部分农业合作社社员收入增加
    河北很多贫农社员获得合作基金贷款
    据新华社武汉二十日电　湖北省一万四千多个农业生产合作社在秋收分配中认真贯彻了互利原则。全省获得增产的一万二千多个社中，约百分之九十五左右的社员增加了收入。根据中共湖北省委员会农村工作部对四千五百一十一个社的九万一千二百四十一户社员的调查和统计，增加收入的有八万六千五百三十六户。
    贯彻互利原则进行分配的结果，大大促进了农业生产合作社的巩固和发展。浠水县王祠乡第五农业生产合作社社员朱启明有一块田常年实产量是十石稻谷，入社时只评八石，因而思想动摇，生产消极，经常提出退社。这次经过调整后，他干活起早摸黑，有说有笑，再也不提退社了。鄂城县胜利农业生产合作社已退社的中农陈世奎，这回看见社员户户增加收入，便申请回社。以前不少社外农民对合作社抱着“建不建，秋后看”的观望态度。这次看到合作社贯彻了互利原则，绝大部分社员增加了收入，便纷纷要求入社或建社。
    据新华社南京十七日电　江苏省今年春季以前建成的三万五千七百多个农业生产合作社，现在正在分配今年的收益。据调查：苏北淮阴县的八百四十一个社今年收成高于去年，八百三十七个社今年收成高于当地互助组和个体农民。全县已经经过收益分配的一万六千二百多户社员中，有一万三千六百多户的收入比入社前增加了，有一千六百多户的收入同去年基本相等。川沙县四个区一百十五个社的试算结果，百分之九十四左右的社员比入社前收入增加。南汇、青浦、嘉定、松江四个县的六百三十七个社中，原有九百四十五户社员顾虑实际收入不如单干多，思想动摇，经过试算分配后，稳定下来。
    新华社保定二十日电　河北省很多参加农业生产合作社的贫农得到了国家银行发放的贫农合作基金贷款。据唐山、邯郸、石家庄、沧县四个专区中五十七个县的统计，得到这项贷款的有二万二千七百多个农业生产合作社，共十三万多户贫农社员。
    农业生产合作社在贷款扶持下进一步巩固起来。盐山县小吕寨胜利农业生产合作社原有五十五户，因贫农无力投资，中农感到吃亏，在麦收后就有三十三户中农退了社，剩下二十户贫农和两户新中农，只有六头牲口，要耕三百二十亩地，眼看着生产发生了困难；后来这个社得到四百五十元贫农合作基金贷款，购买了五头耕畜、两辆大车和两部耘锄，社员生产积极性大大提高，原来退社的中农中又有四户要求回社。任邱县四区白虎村农业生产合作社两户贫农得到贷款后，影响了四户中农也投资一百四十五元，买了一头牛和三口猪，社员们开展了竞赛。
