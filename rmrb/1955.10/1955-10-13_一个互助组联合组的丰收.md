The fact that the Wangjiatai Mutual Aid Team Joint Group in Yangbu Township, Mianyang County, Hubei Province, overcame difficulties and achieved a bumper harvest this year has become a frequent topic of conversation among farmers in the Wangjiatai area recently. The reporter saw in Wangjiatai that the homes of each member of this joint group were filled with new grain (early rice and mid-season rice), large swaths of cotton were being dried in front of their doors, and the late rice in the fields in front of the village had also turned yellow. Zhu Liangyuan, the head of Yangbu Township, told the reporter: "Because of the bumper harvest, this joint group also has a solid foundation for establishing a cooperative. The members are preparing to buy cattle, repair farm tools, and are brewing to transition to a cooperative."

The Wangjiatai Mutual Aid Team Joint Group includes five mutual aid teams and was established during the production self-salvation campaign this spring. During the spring plowing, farmers in this area lacked cattle for plowing. Therefore, in order to ensure that not a single acre of land was left uncultivated, more early rice was planted, and sideline production was also carried out. The members of the mutual aid teams all felt that their teams were small and weak and could not guarantee that they would do a good job. At this time, the Yangbu Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the call to organize joint groups. Therefore, these five mutual aid teams first united, and during the spring plowing, not only was no acre of land left uncultivated, but even more than 100 acres of lake fields were planted with rice seedlings. During the summer and autumn harvests, the five mutual aid teams still worked together.

Recently, the leaders of the five mutual aid teams held a meeting to summarize the benefits of the joint group. With the joint group, each mutual aid team could exchange labor, draft animals, and major farm tools in a unified manner during busy farming seasons for important farm work, adjust surpluses and shortages, seize opportunities, and ensure increased production. Among the five mutual aid teams, some had more paddy fields, some had more dry land; some had more high fields, some had more low fields, and the farm work had different priorities. In the spring, the teams exchanged labor to transplant more than 60 acres of rice seedlings. Although the early rice area was larger than in 1953, the transplanting was completed seven days earlier. During the summer and autumn harvests, they rushed to harvest early rice and mid-season rice, rushed to irrigate water, and rushed to plant late autumn crops. The joint group worked quickly and did not delay the farming season. The fields cultivated by the five mutual aid teams in the spring to help five households of elderly and widowed people have also achieved bumper harvests. Organizing joint groups has also improved the management of mutual aid teams. In the past, the implementation of production plans, small-scale contracting, and clearing accounts based on labor days in each team was not sound enough. Now, in order to carry out joint production, they have made plans for each section, contracted everything on a small scale, and cleared accounts based on labor days on schedule. Qin Nanfang, the secretary of the Yangbu Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party, said: "After organizing the joint group, the awareness of the members has also been raised. They are accustomed to larger-scale collective production than mutual aid teams. Recently, the entire group has applied to transfer to a cooperative."

Indeed, the members have felt that the joint group cannot meet their needs for increased production. In the joint group, only important farm work during busy farming seasons is exchanged and mutually assisted. Most of the farm work during slack seasons is done by each team individually. Moreover, there are many contradictions when arranging farm work during busy seasons, which cannot be resolved well. The team leaders said at the summary meeting: When we establish a cooperative, not only will these contradictions be resolved immediately, but even the production potential that the joint group could not exert in the past can be brought into play. The reporter asked Hu Tusheng and Hu Haishan, members of the joint group who were repairing boats, whether they would still form a joint group next year. Hu Tusheng pointed to the boat and said: "We're oiling it to prepare for joining the cooperative and buying shares. Next year, we should be running a cooperative."

    一个互助组联合组的丰收
    新华社记者　徐士杰
    湖北省沔阳县杨步乡王家坮互助组联合组今年克服困难争得丰收的事实，成了王家坮一带农民最近经常谈论的话题。记者在王家坮看到：这个联合组各家组员的屋里都堆着满囤新谷（早稻、中稻），门口晒着大片棉花，村前田间的晚稻也已经发黄。杨步乡乡长朱良元告诉记者：“这个联合组由于丰收，建社的底子也厚实了。组员已在准备买牛、添修农具，酝酿转社”。
    王家坮互助组联合组包括五个互助组，是在今年春天生产自救运动中成立的。春耕中，这一带农民犁田缺牛。因而要做到不空一亩田，多种早稻，还要进行副业生产，互助组组员都觉得组小力薄，不能保证做好。这时，中共杨步乡支部提出了组织联合组的号召。于是这五个互助组首先联合起来，春耕中不但没有荒一亩田，而且连一百多亩湖田也插上了稻秧。夏收、秋收，五个互助组还是在一起干。
    最近五个互助组的组长开会总结了联合组的好处。有了联合组，各互助组在农忙时重要的农活可以用换工办法统一使用劳力、耕畜和主要农具，能够调剂有无，抢着火色，保证增产。五个互助组中，有的水田多，有的旱地多；有的高田多，有的低田多，农活有先有后。春天组同组换工插秧六十多亩，虽然早稻面积比一九五三年扩大了，但是插秧却提前七天完成。夏、秋之间抢割早稻、中稻，抢灌水和抢种晚秋，联合组干得快，没有耽误农时。五个互助组在春天分别帮助五户孤寡户耕的田地，现在也都丰收了。组织联合组还改进了互助组的经营管理。过去，各组推行生产计划、小包工和清工结账制度，大都不够健全。现在，为了要联合生产，已作到段段订计划，事事小包工，按期清工结账。中共杨步乡支部书记秦南芳说：“组织联合组后，组员们的觉悟也提高了，他们已习惯比互助组更大的集体生产，最近他们全组已申请转社了。”
    的确，组员们已感到联合组不能满足他们的增产需要。在联合组中，只是农忙时的重要农活换工互助，农闲时的农活大都由各组单干；而且农忙安排农活时矛盾也很多，不能很好解决。组长们在总结会上说：我们建了社，不仅这些矛盾会立刻解决，连过去联合组不能发挥的生产潜力，也都能发挥出来。记者曾问正在修理船只的联合组组员胡土生和胡还山，明年是否还搞联合组。胡土生指着船说：“我们油它就是准备转社入股，明年我们该搞社了。”
