Xinhua News Agency, October 20th – The Chinese People's Liberation Army Shooting and Sports Review Conference has been conducting shooting and various military sports competitions continuously since the 16th.

　　On the newly built Beijing shooting range, the shooting teams conduct shooting competitions all day long. On the 16th, the male shooters competed in the 300-meter prone, kneeling, and standing positions with military rifles. The first place was won by Zheng Zhijun, a shooter from the PLA stationed in the Beijing area. His marksmanship was very accurate, with the highest hit rate. The finals were held on the 17th and 18th. In this type of shooting, every five shooters are formed into a group, and every two groups compete once. Upon hearing the command, the shooters lie down side by side on the "starting line" to prepare for shooting. When they hear the command again, they leap forward together, pass through 25 meters to the "shooting line," immediately lie down, load bullets, and fire at the "chest target" 275 meters away. If the shooters in one group knock down the "chest target" in front of them first, the shooters in the other group lose the right to shoot. During the shooting process, each shooter must not only be resourceful and calm but also strive to resolve the "battle" in the shortest possible time. In these two days of finals shooting, the shooting team from the PLA stationed in the Beijing area won the final victory. In the shooting activities on the 19th, the most eye-catching were the shooting competitions of the female shooters. Chen Jiaping, a female shooter from the PLA stationed in the Beijing area, hit 91 rings with ten bullets, winning the first place. Light and heavy machine gun shooting competitions were also held these days. Sixty-two outstanding shooters emerged in the competition. On the 20th, the athletes from the sports teams also went to the Beijing shooting range to participate in basic shooting competitions.

　　At the Xian Nong Tan Stadium, competitions in various military sports events are held every day, including bayonet fighting, hand grenade throwing, full-gear obstacle course of 200 meters, 1000-meter and 100-meter races, pull-ups, tug-of-war, long jump, and apparatus gymnastics. Wonderful performances of pole climbing, rolling wheel, motorcycles, and equestrian were also held these days. These athletes from the PLA and the Volunteer Army fully demonstrated their spirit of loving sports activities and actively exercising their physique in various competitions. Their various competitions and performances were warmly welcomed by the audience. The full-gear 200-meter obstacle course realistically reflects the arduous conditions of the soldiers fighting on the front line and their brave, tenacious, and fearless spirit. The equestrian performance of the Inner Mongolia Cavalry of the PLA is also one of the most popular programs. On the afternoon of the 17th, the young cavalrymen galloped, using steel knives to cut down the small trees on both sides of the road, jumping over 60 cm high bamboo fences, crossbars, and platforms, and also jumped over deep trenches and rings of fire. The cavalrymen also performed the actions of scouting the enemy, chasing the enemy, and their favorite sport—polo.

　　In the past few days, the results of various sports competitions at the conference have gradually improved, creating many excellent achievements. In the long jump competition on the 17th, Mei Shidong from the PLA stationed in the Jinan area won the first place with 4 meters and 97 centimeters. In the hand grenade throwing competition on the 18th, Zheng Qingzhang from the PLA stationed in the Jinan area won the first place. On the 19th, Wei Kunbing from the PLA stationed in the Kunming area surpassed all the results of passing the 200-meter obstacle course since the conference began, with a time of one minute and forty-two seconds. In the pull-up competition, Tu Zhanglong from the PLA stationed in the Nanjing area had very strong arm strength, and his score was 20 times. Liu Xingzhen from the PLA stationed in the Nanjing area showed good endurance and speed in the 1000-meter race, winning the first place with two minutes and fifty-eight seconds. His score was the best in the 1000-meter race in the past few days.

　　Currently, the shooting and sports competitions of the conference are still continuing.

    解放军射击和体育检阅大会进行各项比赛
    新华社二十日讯　中国人民解放军射击与体育检阅大会自十六日起连续进行了射击和各种军事体育项目的比赛。
    在新建成的北京射击场上，各射击代表队整日进行射击比赛活动。十六日进行了男射击手军用步枪三百公尺卧、跪、立姿势的射击比赛。得到第一名的是解放军驻北京地区部队的射击手郑志军，他的枪法很准，命中率最高。十七日和十八日两天进行了决赛射击，这种射击是每五名射击手编成一组，每两组进行一次比赛。射击手们一听到口令就要并排卧倒在“出发地线”，做好射击准备，再听到口令时就一起飞跃前进，经过二十五公尺到“射击地线”马上卧倒装填子弹，对准二百七十五公尺远的“胸靶”一齐发射。如果这一组的射击手先将自己前方的“胸靶”打倒，另一组的射击手便失掉了射击权利。在射击过程中每个射击手不但要机智、沉着，而且还要争取在最短时间内解决“战斗”。这两天的决赛射击，由解放军驻北京地区部队的射击队得到最后胜利。在十九日的射击活动中，最引人注意的是女射击手们的射击比赛。解放军驻北京地区部队的女射击手陈家萍用十发子弹，打中九十一环，得到第一名。这几天还进行了轻、重机枪的射击比赛。在比赛中出现了六十二名优秀射手。二十日，各体育代表队的运动员们，也到北京射击场参加了基本射击比赛。
    在先农坛体育场，每天都进行刺杀、手榴弹掷远、全副武装通过二百公尺障碍、千公尺和百公尺赛跑、引体向上、拔河、跳远和器械体操等各项军事体育项目比赛。这几天还举行了爬杆、滚轮、摩托车和马术的精彩表演。这些来自解放军和志愿军各部队中的运动员们，在各项比赛中充分表现了他们热爱体育活动，积极锻炼体质的精神。他们的各项比赛和表演都受到了观众们的热烈欢迎。全副武装通过二百公尺障碍的比赛，逼真地反映了战士们在前线作战的艰苦情形和勇敢、顽强、不怕困难的精神。解放军内蒙古骑兵部队的马术表演也是最受欢迎的项目之一。十七日下午，年轻的骑兵们飞奔着用钢刀砍倒道两旁的小树，跳过六十公分高的竹篱、横木、平台，还跳过深沟和熊火圈。骑兵们还表演了侦察敌人、追击敌人的动作以及他们最喜爱的运动——马球赛。
    几天来，大会的各项体育比赛成绩逐步提高，创造了许多优秀成绩。十七日的跳远比赛中，解放军驻济南地区部队代表队的梅仕栋以四公尺九七公分得到第一名。十八日的手榴弹掷远比赛中，解放军驻济南地区部队代表队的郑清章得到第一名。十九日，解放军驻昆明地区部队代表队的韦坤秉以一分四十二秒的时间，超过大会举行以来通过二百公尺障碍的所有成绩。在引体向上的比赛中，解放军驻南京地区部队代表队的屠章龙的臂力很强，他的成绩是二十次。解放军驻南京地区部队代表队的刘兴振在千公尺赛跑中，表现了很好的耐力和速度，以二分五十八秒得到第一名，在几天的千公尺赛跑中，他的成绩最好。
    现在，大会的射击和体育比赛项目仍在继续进行。
