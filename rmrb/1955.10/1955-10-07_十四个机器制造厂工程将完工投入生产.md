Fourteen machine manufacturing plant projects in our country are in the final stages of construction or will soon be. Some projects will be completed and put into production by the end of this year. The First Ministry of Machine Building recently held a meeting to prepare for acceptance inspections and made specific arrangements for the completion and acceptance of these factories.

These fourteen projects are the main construction projects of the machine industry in our country's First Five-Year Plan. Among them, the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, the Shenyang Wire Factory, and the Harbin Electricity Meter and Instrument Factory are large-scale new construction and reconstruction projects. By June of next year, after all fourteen factories are transferred to production, plus the factories that have been built in the past two years, the First Ministry of Machine Building will have completed more than half of the projects planned for completion during the First Five-Year Plan.

After these factories are put into production, various sectors of our national economy will obtain more machine products that could not be produced in old China, including large machine tools, automatic and semi-automatic special machine tools, medium-sized steam turbine generators urgently needed for power station projects, medium-sized boilers and other power equipment needed in large quantities for production and construction projects, electricity meters and instruments that play a significant role in improving the technological level of industrial production in our country, and various cables and wires for manufacturing airplanes, automobiles, tractors, locomotives, and various tools, ships, etc. The generators produced by several of these factories each year can equip many power stations, and a new type of machine tool produced by one machine tool factory can equip six or seven large machine factories each year.

At the recent meeting to prepare for acceptance inspections, the First Ministry of Machine Building reviewed the progress of the acceptance preparations for these fourteen factories and exchanged experiences in acceptance. The meeting pointed out that the completion of these projects is a major achievement of our country's First Five-Year Plan, and enterprises must be prepared and conscientiously carry out the completion and acceptance work of these factories to avoid the serious phenomenon of delayed or hasty acceptance due to insufficient preparation for completion and acceptance in some projects in the past, resulting in the failure of projects to be put into production in a timely manner or frequent shutdowns after being put into production. The meeting required that the factory directors of each factory personally take action to quickly establish acceptance preparation committees, formulate plans for acceptance preparation, and designate dedicated personnel to be responsible for implementation. Data such as design, which is an important basis for acceptance, should be immediately sorted out, and the construction of the final stage of the project should be expedited, and measures and plans for timely completion should be drafted together with the construction units. In addition, the meeting also required acceptance personnel to conscientiously study relevant acceptance documents so that they can make a correct evaluation of the "good, fast, and economical" aspects of the project in accordance with the requirements of the documents.

    十四个机器制造厂工程将完工投入生产
    我国有十四个机器制造厂工程的施工已经或很快就要进入收尾阶段，有些工程在今年年底就要完工投入生产。第一机械工业部在最近举行了验收准备工作会议，对这批工厂完工验收的准备工作作了具体部署。
    这十四个工程都是我国第一个五年计划中机械工业基本建设工程的主要项目。其中如沈阳第一机床厂、沈阳电线厂、哈尔滨电表仪器厂等都是规模巨大的新建和改建工程。到明年六月，这十四个工厂全部移交生产后，加上过去两年多来已经建成的工厂，第一机械工业部在第一个五年计划期间计划完工的工程项目可以完成一半以上。
    这些工厂投入生产后，我国国民经济各部门就要得到更多的旧中国不能生产的机器产品，其中包括大型工作母机、自动和半自动的专用机床、电站工程迫切需要的中型汽轮发电机、生产和建设工程中大量需要的中型锅炉和其他动力设备、对提高我国工业生产技术水平有重大作用的电表仪器和制造飞机、汽车、拖拉机、火车头用的各种电缆电线，以及各种工具、船舶等。这些工厂中有几个厂每年生产的发电机可以装备许多电站，有一个机床厂生产的一种新式机床，每年可以装备六、七个大机器厂。
    在最近举行的验收准备工作会议上，第一机械工业部检查了这十四个工厂验收准备工作的进展情况，交流了验收方面的经验。会议指出：这些工程的完工，是我国第一个五年计划的重大成果，各企业必须有准备地、认真地做好这批工厂的完工验收工作，避免过去有些工程因完工验收准备工作不足，致使验收拖延或草率，结果使工程不能及时投入生产或投入生产后经常发生停车事故的严重现象。会议要求各工厂厂长亲自动手，迅速成立验收准备委员会，制定验收准备工作的计划，确定专人负责执行。对作为验收重要依据的设计等方面的资料要立刻加以整理，同时抓紧收尾工程的施工，并同施工单位一起拟出按时完工的措施计划。此外，会议还要求验收人员认真学习有关验收方面的文件，以便能按照文件的要求，对工程的“好、快、省”作出正确的评价。（新华社）
