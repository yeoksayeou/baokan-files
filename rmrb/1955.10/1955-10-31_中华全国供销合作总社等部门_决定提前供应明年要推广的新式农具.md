Xinhua News Agency, 30th. To adapt to the new situation in the agricultural cooperation movement, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the First Ministry of Machine Building, among other departments, have decided to supply a portion of the new-style animal-powered agricultural implements that will be promoted next year to various regions ahead of schedule.

The 160,000 double-wheeled double-shared plows that various agricultural implement factories plan to produce in the fourth quarter of this year have been distributed by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives to the supply and marketing cooperatives in various provinces and cities, and their transportation from factories is being organized ahead of schedule. These agricultural implements were originally planned to be promoted next year, but it is now estimated that half of them will be transported to the basic-level supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties by the end of November to supply farmers. The majority of the 400,000 double-wheeled double-shared plows and double-wheeled single-shared plows planned to be promoted this year have already been transported to rural areas across the country. The First Ministry of Machine Building and the Third Ministry of Machine Building also plan to organize various agricultural implement factories to increase production by another 110,000 double-shared and single-shared plows before the end of December to supply the supply and marketing cooperatives in various provinces and cities.

In the past two months, farmers in various regions have been actively organizing agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the existing agricultural producers' cooperatives have generally been adding production materials, resulting in a significant increase in the purchase of new-style agricultural implements compared to before. From July to early October, supply and marketing cooperatives across the country sold a total of more than 150,000 double-shared and single-shared plows, an increase of nearly one-fold compared to the sales volume in the first half of the year. Many provincial supply and marketing cooperatives have felt that the existing double-shared and single-shared plows are not enough to meet the demand and have requested to increase procurement ahead of schedule. Seven provinces, including Shanxi, Henan, Jiangsu, and Hebei, have requested to increase procurement by 30,600 units before the end of October. Shanxi Province originally planned to promote 20,000 units this year but now requests to increase it by 5,000 units.

The majority of the double-shared and single-shared plows promoted in the second half of this year have already been put into use. Including those promoted in the past few years, there are now approximately 260,000 double-shared and single-shared plows being used in autumn plowing and sowing across the country.

    中华全国供销合作总社等部门
    决定提前供应明年要推广的新式农具
    新华社三十日讯　为适应农业合作化运动的新情况，中华全国供销合作总社和农业部、第一机械工业部等部门已决定把明年推广的一部分新式畜力农具提前供应各地。
    各农具工厂计划在今年第四季度生产的十六万部双轮双铧犁，已由全国供销合作总社分配给各省、市供销合作社，并提前从工厂组织调运。这批农具原来计划在明年推广的，现在预计到十一月底，将有半数可运到各县基层供销合作社供应农民。今年计划推广的四十万部双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁大部分已运到各地农村。第一机械工业部、第三机械工业部还计划组织各农具厂在今年十二月底前再增产十一万部双铧犁和单铧犁，供给各省、市供销合作社。
    近两个月来，各地农民纷纷组织农业生产合作社，老的农业生产合作社普遍添置生产资料，因此购买新式农具的比以前增加很多。从七月到十月上旬，全国各地供销合作社共销售了双铧犁和单铧犁十五万多部，比上半年的推销数增加将近一倍。许多省的供销合作社已感到现存的双铧犁和单铧犁不够供应，要求提前进货。山西、河南、江苏、河北等七省要求在十月底前增加进货三万零六百部。山西省原计划今年推广二万部，现要求增加五千部。
    今年下半年推广的双铧犁和单铧犁大部分已被使用。连过去几年推广的计算在内，各地已有约二十六万部双铧犁和单铧犁用于秋耕秋种。
