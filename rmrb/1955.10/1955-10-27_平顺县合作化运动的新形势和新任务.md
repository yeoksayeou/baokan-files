    New Situation and New Tasks of the Cooperative Movement in Pingshun County
    Li Lin, Secretary of the Pingshun County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Shanxi Province

    I. The agricultural cooperative movement in Pingshun County has a history of more than ten years. It has been five years since the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives of a semi-socialist nature in 1951. Over the past five years, a total of 378 cooperatives have been established in the county, with more than 26,000 peasant households joining, accounting for more than 88 percent of the total number of peasant households. A new high tide of the socialist mass movement has emerged. This is a great victory for the socialist transformation of agriculture in the county.
    The reason why the cooperative movement in Pingshun County can develop rapidly is that the obvious fact that cooperatives have achieved increased production batch after batch, year after year, has powerfully attracted more and more farmers. The peasants have given the cooperative the evaluation of "good direction, high yield, and large income." Listening to the Communist Party and taking the socialist road has become the firm and unwavering will of the broad masses of peasants.

    II
　　Agricultural cooperation has changed the face of the countryside, and semi-socialist cooperatives have become the dominant production organization in the countryside. This has greatly promoted the development of agricultural productive forces. In 1954, the total grain output of the county was 53.6 million jin, an increase of more than 10 million jin compared with 1949, and the average yield per mu increased by 26.6 percent, exceeding the highest production level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. In 1954, the total value of animal products, local specialties, and forestry products was 1,702,585 yuan, an increase of 79.5 percent compared with 1949, and 65.8 percent compared with 1937. In 1949, local specialties and animal products accounted for 8.21 percent of the total agricultural income, while in 1954, they accounted for 53.9 percent. In total, the total income of agriculture, sideline occupations, forestry, and animal husbandry in the county was 4,919,639 yuan in 1954, an increase of 76 percent compared with 1949, and 60.6 percent compared with 1937. In recent years, the county has closed mountains for afforestation of 140,000 mu, sown 139,000 mu of barren mountains, cultivated 3,150 mu of young forests, planted 6.68 million scattered trees, cultivated 389 mu of nurseries, built 3,421 gully dams, renovated 8,035 mu of terraced fields, repaired 4,452 flood control canals, and repaired 3,720 mu of river beaches. The county has carried out comprehensive production planning on the basis of cooperation, which can be carried out in a planned way in close combination with the long-term interests and immediate interests of the peasants, in order to fundamentally change the face of the mountainous area.
    The development of cooperation has caused important changes in the class relations in the countryside. That is, the poor and new middle peasants occupy an absolute dominant position in the economy and politics, some well-to-do middle peasants are increasingly approaching the cooperative from a skeptical and wait-and-see attitude, the spontaneous trend of rural capitalism has been greatly weakened, and the production methods of the rich peasants and usury have been basically eliminated. According to a typical survey of Niujiahou Village, which represents a general village, the average annual income per person of 69 poor and middle peasant households in the village was 38.8 yuan, which was 36 percent higher than the income of peasants before the War of Resistance Against Japan (1937). According to a survey of 290 members of the Hongtigan Agricultural Production Cooperative, in 1953, there were 112 households lacking food, with 462 people, buying 33,000 jin of grain; in 1954, there were 49 households lacking food, buying 6,500 jin of grain; and this year, there was not a single household lacking food.
    The broad masses of peasants have experienced from real life that the road to common prosperity through cooperation cannot be separated from the help of the state and the support of socialist industry. Therefore, they regard actively paying public grain and selling surplus grain to support the country's industrialization as their glorious task. The peasants in the county can complete the task of purchasing 9 million to 10 million jin of grain every year, and also sell a large number of forestry and animal husbandry products and by-products in exchange for the production and living materials they need.
    The upsurge of agricultural cooperation in Pingshun County has caused profound changes in the material life, culture, health, and customs of the peasants. The living standards of cooperative peasants have generally improved, reaching the level of middle peasants. Peasants who used to suffer exploitation and live in hunger have now become people with guaranteed livelihoods. According to the survey, the per capita annual purchasing power of peasants in the county has increased as follows: 4.93 yuan in 1949, 6.55 yuan in 1950, 6.87 yuan in 1951, 10.5 yuan in 1952, 17.67 yuan in 1953, and 29.3 yuan in 1954. Generally, peasants wear neat clothes, most of them have new and old, single and lined, and cotton clothes. In the words of the peasants themselves, it is: "A towel covers the head, sneakers on the feet, city cloth clothes on the body, and a floral cotton blanket at night." Industrial products such as rain boots, flashlights, umbrellas, blankets, and felt have increasingly large sales in rural areas; biscuits, candies, and other things are also coming to the countryside more and more. The peasants have forever abandoned the tragic life of being a hired laborer, suffering from hunger, and eating bran and swallowing vegetables.
    With the development of production, cultural education and health facilities in rural areas are constantly expanding. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were only more than 100 primary schools in Pingshun County. Now the number of primary schools has increased to more than 400, and the number of children enrolled has reached 93 percent of school-age children. In addition, a brand-new secondary school has been established. 363 private schools and literacy classes have been established in rural areas, with more than 64,000 young men and women participating in the study. The county has established 272 libraries, book packages, four clubs, and twenty-five literary and art groups. Thirteen telephones and seventy-two radios have been installed in rural areas. The county has one hospital and seven health centers. According to the survey, the infant mortality rate in the county has dropped significantly compared with 1949. New hygiene habits have begun to be established in rural areas.
    The cooperative movement is truly a major change in customs for the countryside. The past 26,000 individual farmers have now become 378 large-scale collective labor units. In the past, each household lived its own life, and people were isolated and weak, unable to withstand any disasters and difficulties. Now the peasants are "relying on agricultural cooperatives for production, on supply and marketing cooperatives for life, and on credit cooperatives for money." In the past, people relied on families and relatives when they had difficulties; now they rely on the cooperatives. The new moral consciousness of taking the cooperative as home, loving the cooperative, and loving the collective is growing day by day. In Dihe Township, two widows in their seventies handed over their land to the cooperative, and the cooperative signed such a contract with them: taking care of their lives while they are alive and taking care of their burial after they die. The two old women were taken care of by the cooperative, and they lacked nothing in firewood, water, rice, and noodles. The two old women said with emotion: Relying on the cooperative is better than relying on their own sons. The society run by Chairman Mao is really good. Now the most famous people in the countryside are Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, Wu Houli, Shen Jilan and other model figures in running cooperatives and labor. There are fewer lazy people, fewer land disputes, fewer quarrels and fights, fewer people worshiping gods and seeking medicine, and fewer speculative merchants in rural areas. It has become a new social atmosphere that labor is glorious and exploitation is shameful.

    III
　　The agricultural cooperative movement in Pingshun County has taken two steps on the road of socialist transformation of agriculture in the direction indicated by the Party and Chairman Mao, that is, from mutual aid teams with socialist sprouts to semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives; now it is about to enter the third step, that is, on the basis of further running semi-socialist cooperatives well, these cooperatives will gradually transition to agricultural production cooperatives of a completely socialist nature. This is the new situation and new task of the Pingshun cooperative movement. The initial victory that has been achieved is gratifying and encouraging, but the tasks ahead are more arduous and complex. From the perspective of developing agricultural production, the primary cooperatives that have been established have created very favorable conditions for further improving productivity. That is to say, as long as the superiority of this kind of cooperative is brought into full play, more grain and industrial raw materials can be produced, vigorously supporting the country's industrialization, gradually improving the lives of the peasants, and at the same time, gradually transforming the existing semi-socialist agricultural cooperatives into agricultural cooperatives of a completely socialist nature. According to the county's economic plan, in about fifteen years, the average per capita income of the county will reach 3,443 jin of grain. To achieve this glorious goal, more hard work is required. On the other hand, carrying out socialist transformation of the small peasant economy is a long-term task. Joining the cooperative is only the beginning of the transformation. In order to greatly improve the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants on the existing basis, it is necessary to further strengthen political and ideological work. At the same time, we see that due to the victorious development of the cooperative movement, the class struggle in the countryside has become increasingly acute. Only by resolutely crushing the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements can we guarantee the complete victory of the agricultural cooperative movement.
    In order to complete the new tasks under the new situation of the agricultural cooperative movement, the following tasks must be done well at present.
    First, it is necessary to rectify the Party organizations and train cadres throughout the county. At present, some cadres and Party members lack sensitivity to new things, and some cadres are developing blindly optimistic emotions, believing that everything is proper and easy to handle after the realization of semi-socialist cooperation. Undoubtedly, if this harmful sentiment is not overcome, it will inevitably cause great damage to the cooperative movement. Therefore, it is necessary to: First, conduct centralized training for rural Party members in batches before and after the autumn harvest this year. Each Party branch should also conduct evaluation, appraisal, and communist education for Party members through summarizing and inspecting cooperative work. Second, it is decided to convene a conference of socialist construction activists and a conference of labor models in the county after the autumn to summarize the cooperative work and mobilize Party members, cadres, and activists to strive to achieve the new tasks of the cooperative movement. Third, the county is preparing to train about 3,500 cooperative backbones this winter and spring to prepare leadership forces for the new development of the cooperative movement.
    Secondly, promote the experience of Yangjingdi, Anyang and other townships in implementing comprehensive production planning, vigorously tap production potential, realize the policy of comprehensively developing mountain production, and lead various townships to formulate fifteen-year long-term plans in accordance with local conditions. The average yield per mu in the county is currently 228 jin, while the yield per mu in Yangjingdi, Wangzhuang and other cooperatives is more than 420 jin. If the agricultural production level of the county is raised to the production level of Yangjingdi Cooperative, the grain output can be increased by about 50 million jin, and the average per capita grain can be increased from the current 500 jin to 1,000 jin. In addition, it is also necessary to make full use of the conditions of the mountains, vigorously develop forestry and animal husbandry, and do a good job in soil and water conservation to create wealth from the mountains. In the fifteen-year plan of the county, it is stipulated that the income of forestry, animal husbandry, and other sideline occupations will account for 77 percent of the total income, an increase of eleven times compared with the present. The conditions for achieving these production targets are available, because we have a large number of cooperative organizations, and the state has economic and technical support. At present, a large number of labor forces in many cooperatives have not been fully utilized. If the labor utilization rate of each cooperative reaches the level of Xigou Agricultural Production Cooperative, with each labor force doing 200 workdays throughout the year, the county can increase 2,414,400 workdays; If we further fully organize women's labor force to participate in production, calculating each woman's labor force working 30 workdays per year, the county can increase another 637,500 workdays per year. Only on the basis of continuous improvement of productivity and continuous growth of members' awareness can we ensure that the cooperative gradually transitions from the collective ownership of some means of production to complete collective ownership.
    Thirdly, in order to promote the cooperative movement on the basis of consolidating the existing cooperatives, it is first necessary to conduct a general rectification of the cooperatives in the county this winter and next spring. The focus of the rectification should be on implementing the mutual benefit policy, adjusting the leadership composition, and improving operation and management. Special attention should be paid to the rectification work of large cooperatives and cooperatives in areas where farmers live scattered, so as to ensure that all cooperatives in the county generally reach consolidation.
    Finally, according to the decision of the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee, the County Party Committee is prepared to draw more than 120 cadres to form 20 key point working groups to strengthen the leadership of the cooperatives. In the future, the County Party Committee will fully use the working groups and rely on the township branches to promote cooperative work and change the past handicraft-style leadership methods. In addition, all systems and departments in the county are required to adapt to the new situation and new tasks of the agricultural cooperative movement ideologically, organizationally, and professionally, and give strong cooperation to the cooperative movement to ensure the victory of the socialist transformation.

    平顺县合作化运动的新形势和新任务
    中共山西省平顺县委书记  李琳
    一 　 平顺县的农业合作化运动，已经有十多年的历史；从一九五一年开始建立半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社起，也已经有五年的历史。五年来，全县共建立了三百七十八个社，入社农户二万六千多户，占总农户的百分之八十八多。新的社会主义群众运动的高潮已经出现。这是全县农业的社会主义改造事业的一个巨大胜利。
    平顺县合作化运动所以能够迅速地发展，是由于合作社一批又一批、一年又一年地获得增产这个鲜明的事实，有力地吸引了越来越多的农民。农民已给合作社下了“方向好，产量高，收入大”的评语。听共产党的话，走社会主义的路——这已成为广大农民的坚定不移的意志了。
    二
　　农业合作化，改变了农村的面貌，半社会主义的合作社已经成为农村中占统治地位的生产组织了。这就大大促进了农业生产力的发展。一九五四年全县粮食总产量为五千三百六十万斤，比一九四九年增加了一千多万斤，平均每亩产量提高了百分之二十六·六，超过了抗日战争前的最高生产水平。一九五四年的畜产品、土产特产品和林业产品的总值为一百七十万二千五百八十五元，比一九四九年提高百分之七十九·五，比一九三七年提高百分之六十五·八。一九四九年土产特产品、畜产品占农业总收入的百分之八·二一，而一九五四年则占农业总收入的百分之五十三·九。总计全县农业、副业、林业、牧畜业的总收入，在一九五四年为四百九十一万九千六百三十九元，比一九四九年提高百分之七十六，比一九三七年提高百分之六十·六。几年来，全县封山育林十四万亩，荒山播种十三万九千多亩，抚育幼林三千一百五十亩，零星植树六百六十八万株，培育苗圃三百八十九亩，建谷坊三千四百二十一座，整修梯田八千零三十五亩，修防洪渠四千四百五十二道，修河滩三千七百二十亩。全县已经在合作化的基础上进行了全面的生产规划，这就可以在农民的长远利益同眼前利益密切结合的基础上，有计划地进行山区建设，以便从根本上改变山区的面貌。
    合作化的发展在农村阶级关系上引起了重要的变化。这就是贫农和新中农在经济上、政治上占居于绝对优势的地位，某些富裕中农由怀疑观望越来越向合作社靠拢，农村资本主义自发趋势大大受到削弱，富农的生产方式和高利贷剥削已经基本上消灭。根据代表一般乡村的牛家后村的典型调查，全村六十九户贫农中农，每人全年平均收入为三十八·八元，高于抗日战争前（一九三七年）的农民收入百分之三十六。根据虹梯关农业生产合作社二百九十户社员的调查，一九五三年缺粮户是一百十二户，四百六十二人，买进粮食三万三千斤；一九五四年缺粮户是四十九户，买进粮食六千五百斤；今年一户缺粮户也没有了。
    广大农民已经从现实生活中体验到，要走共同富裕的合作化道路，是离不开国家的帮助，离不开社会主义工业的支持的。因此，他们把积极缴纳公粮和出卖余粮，支援国家工业化，当做是自己的光荣任务。全县农民每年可以完成九百万到一千万斤粮食征购任务，此外还卖出大量的林、牧业产品和副产品，换回自己所需要的生产、生活资料。
    平顺县农业合作化的高涨，在农民的物质生活、文化卫生、风俗习惯等方面都引起了深刻的变化。入社农民的生活水平普遍有了提高，达到了中农水平。过去受尽剥削、过着饥饿生活的农民，现在成了生活上有保障的人了。据调查，全县农民每人每年购买力提高的情况如下：一九四九年为四·九三元，一九五○年为六·五五元，一九五一年为六·八七元，一九五二年为十·五元，一九五三年为十七·六七元，一九五四年为二十九·三元。一般农民普遍穿上了整齐的衣服，大部分人有新有旧，有单有夹有棉。用农民自己的话说，就是：“毛巾头上罩，球鞋脚上登，身上穿的市布衣，黑夜盖的花贡呢。”雨鞋、手电、雨伞、毯子、毡子等工业品在农村中有着越来越大的销路；饼干、糖果等下乡的也越来越多。农民们已经永远抛弃了当长工、受饥受饿、吞糠咽菜的悲惨生活了。
    随着生产的发展，农村中文化教育和卫生设施正在不断地扩大。平顺县抗日战争前仅有一百多座小学，现在小学增加到四百多座，入学儿童达到学龄儿童的百分之九十三；此外，还建立了一座崭新的中等学校。农村中建立了三百六十三座民校和识字班，有六万四千多男女青壮年参加了学习。全县建立了二百七十二个图书馆、图书包，四座俱乐部，二十五个文艺小组。农村架设了十三部电话机，七十二部收音机。全县有卫生院一座、卫生所七座。据调查，全县婴儿的死亡率已比一九四九年大大下降。农村中新的卫生习惯开始建立起来了。
    合作化运动对于农村来说，真是一个移风易俗的大变化。过去的二万六千多户的个体农户现在变成了三百七十八个集体劳动的大生产单位。过去一家一户过日子，人孤势单，经不起任何灾害和困难；现在农民是“生产靠农业社，生活靠供销社，用钱靠信用社”。过去人们有困难，靠家族靠亲戚；现在靠社了。以社为家、爱社、爱集体的新的道德意识，日益成长起来了。底河乡有两位七十多岁的寡妇老太太把地交给了合作社，合作社同她们订立了这样的合同：活着管养活，死了管埋葬。两位老人受到社的照顾，柴水米面一切都不缺。两位老太太感动地说：靠社比靠自己的儿子还强，毛主席行的这社会实在好。现在农村最有名的人是李顺达、郭玉恩、武侯梨、申纪兰等办社和劳动方面的模范人物。农村中懒汉少了，土地纠纷少了，吵嘴打架的人少了，拜神求药的人少了，投机商人少了。劳动光荣，剥削可耻。这已经成了新的社会风气。
    三
　　平顺县的农业合作化运动已经按照党和毛主席指示的方向，在农业的社会主义改造的道路上走过了两步，即走过了由带有社会主义萌芽的互助组到半社会主义的农业生产合作社这两步；现在就要进入第三个步骤了，就是进一步办好半社会主义性质的合作社的基础上，使这些合作社逐步向完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社过渡。这就是平顺合作化运动新形势和新任务。已经取得的初步胜利，是值得欢欣鼓舞的，但是今后的任务更艰巨、更复杂了。从发展农业生产方面来说，已经建立起来的初级的合作社给进一步提高生产力创造了非常有利的条件。这就是说，只要充分发挥这种合作社的优越性，就能生产出更多的粮食和工业原料，大力支援国家工业化，逐步改善农民的生活，同时使现有的半社会主义性质的农业合作社逐步变为完全社会主义性质的农业合作社。根据全县经济规划，在十五年左右的时间内，全县每人平均收入要达到折合粮食三千四百四十三斤。实现这一光辉的奋斗目标，需要付出更辛勤的劳动。另一方面，对小农经济实行社会主义改造，是一个长期的任务。农民入了社，这仅是改造的开始，为要把广大农民的社会主义觉悟在现有的基础上大大提高一步，就必须进一步加强政治思想工作。同时我们看到，由于合作化运动的胜利发展，农村阶级斗争已日益尖锐化，只有坚决地粉碎反革命分子的破坏活动，才能保证农业合作化运动的彻底胜利。
    为了完成农业合作化运动新形势下的新任务，目前必须要做好以下几项工作。
    首先，要整顿全县的党组织和训练干部。目前在某些干部和党员中有对新事物缺乏敏感的现象，有些干部正在滋长盲目乐观的情绪，认为实现半社会主义的合作化以后，一切都妥贴好办了。无疑地，如果不克服这种有害的情绪，就必然使合作化运动受到很大的损害。为此，就必须：第一、在今年秋收前后分批集训农村党员。各个党支部也要通过总结、检查合作化工作，对党员进行评比鉴定和共产主义教育。第二、秋后决定召开全县社会主义建设积极分子大会和劳动模范大会，总结合作化工作，并动员党员、干部和积极分子为实现合作化运动的新任务而奋斗。第三、全县今冬明春准备训练三千五百人左右的合作社骨干，为合作化运动的新发展准备领导力量。
    其次，推广羊井底、安阳等乡实行全面生产规划的经验，大力挖掘生产潜力，实现全面发展山区生产的方针，领导各个乡因地制宜地制定出十五年远景规划，现在全县平均每亩产量是二百二十八斤，而羊井底、王庄等合作社每亩产量都在四百二十斤以上。如果把全县农业生产水平提高到羊井底合作社的生产水平，即可增加粮食产量五千万斤左右，每人平均得到的粮食可由现在的五百斤增到一千斤。另外，还必须充分利用山地的条件，大力发展林业、牧畜业，做好水土保持工作，从山上创造财富。全县在十五年规划中，规定林业、牧业和其他副业的收入占到总收入的百分之七十七，比现在提高十一倍。实现这些生产指标的条件是具备了的，因为我们有大量的合作社组织，有国家在经济上、技术上的支援。目前许多合作社的大批劳动力仍然没有充分发挥，如果每个社的劳动力利用率达到西沟农业生产合作社的水平，全年每个劳力做二百个劳动日，全县即可增加二百四十一万四千四百个劳动日；如果再充分组织妇女劳力参加生产，以每个妇女劳力每年做三十个劳动日计算，全县每年又可增加六十三万七千五百个劳动日。只有在生产力不断提高和社员觉悟不断增长的基础上，才能保证合作社由部分生产资料集体所有制逐步过渡到完全的集体所有制。
    再次，为要在巩固已有的合作社的基础上推进合作化运动，首先必须在今冬明春对全县的合作社普遍进行一次整顿，整顿的重点要放在执行互利政策、调整领导成份、改善经营管理等方面，特别要注意大社和农民居住分散地区合作社的整顿工作，以保证全县所有的合作社普遍达到巩固。
    最后，根据省委、地委的决定，县委准备抽出一百二十多个干部组成二十个基点工作组，以加强对合作社的领导。今后县委将充分运用工作组和依靠乡支部来推动合作化工作，改变过去的手工业式的领导方法。此外，要求全县各个系统、各个部门要从思想上、组织上、业务上适应农业合作化运动的新形势、新任务，对合作化运动给予有力的配合，保证社会主义改造事业的胜利。
