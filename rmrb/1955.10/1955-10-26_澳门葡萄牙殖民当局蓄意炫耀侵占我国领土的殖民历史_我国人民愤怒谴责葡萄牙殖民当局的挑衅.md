Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 25th: In recent months, the Macao Portuguese colonial authorities have been preparing to hold the so-called "400th Anniversary of the Opening of Macao," deliberately flaunting its colonial history of occupying China's territory - Macao. As early as January of this year, the Macao Portuguese colonial authorities organized a preparatory committee for the celebration activities and began planning. In recent months, they have been actively carrying out preparatory work. On October 12th, the Portuguese colonial authorities formally announced the so-called "celebration program," planning to conduct activities throughout November, erect a monument to the Portuguese occupation of Macao, issue commemorative stamps of the occupation of Macao, and hold a flag-raising ceremony for the colonial ruler, the Governor of Macao. Local people in Macao have expressed their opposition to this, believing that the Macao colonial authorities' move is an insult to the Chinese people. People from all walks of life here were extremely indignant upon hearing the news and condemned the Portuguese colonial authorities for this serious provocative behavior against the Chinese people.

Under the opposition of the Chinese people, the Portuguese colonial authorities had to announce on October 21st that they would suspend the "celebration commemoration" and cancel the "celebration program" on the grounds of "insufficient funds." People here believe that the Chinese people cannot remain silent about the provocative propaganda of the Macao Portuguese colonial authorities regarding the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the occupation of Macao for several months. Macao is China's territory, and the Chinese people have the right to demand the return of this territory from the Portuguese colonialists.

    澳门葡萄牙殖民当局蓄意炫耀侵占我国领土的殖民历史
    我国人民愤怒谴责葡萄牙殖民当局的挑衅
    新华社广州二十五日电　近几个月来，澳门葡萄牙殖民当局筹备举行所谓庆祝“澳门开埠四百周年纪念”，蓄意炫耀其侵占中国领土——澳门的殖民历史。早在今年一月，澳门葡萄牙殖民当局就组织了庆祝活动的筹备委员会，开始筹划，近几月来更积极进行筹备工作。十月十二日，葡萄牙殖民当局正式宣布了所谓“庆祝程序”，计划以十一月全月进行活动，建立葡萄牙侵占澳门的纪念碑，发行侵占澳门的纪念邮票，举行殖民统治者澳门总督的升像礼。澳门当地各界人民对此纷纷表示反对，认为澳门殖民当局此举是对中国人民的侮辱。此间各界人士闻讯后极为愤慨，谴责葡萄牙殖民当局这种对中国人民的严重挑衅行为。
    在中国人民的反对下，葡萄牙殖民当局不得不于十月二十一日以“经费不足”为理由，宣布中止举行“庆祝纪念”，取消“庆祝程序”。此间人士认为，中国人民对于澳门葡萄牙殖民当局数月来关于庆祝侵占澳门四百周年的挑衅性宣传，不能保持缄默。澳门是中国的领土，中国人民有权利要求从葡萄牙殖民者手中收回这块领土。
