    Another Great Joy for the Tibetan People
    Dalai Lama
    The two highways from Lhasa to Shigatse and from Shigatse to Gyantse have been opened to traffic. This is another significant achievement in the State Council's assistance to Tibet in construction matters, following the simultaneous opening of the Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet highways to Lhasa. This once again proves with facts the boundless care and sincere help of our great motherland for the construction cause of minority areas. On the occasion of celebrating the opening of the Lhasa-Shigatse and Shigatse-Gyantse highways, all of us monks and lay people in Tibet express our deep and heartfelt gratitude to the great Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups in our country, Chairman Mao Zedong.
    The opening of these two highways greatly facilitates transportation within Tibet, connects the three major towns of Tibet, strengthens the ties between various regions within Tibet, facilitates my and Panchen Erdeni's mutual visits to discuss work, and has a significant role in further enhancing the unity within Tibet and promoting the development of Tibet's political, economic, and cultural construction. This is another great joy for the Tibetan people, and also a common joy for the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland, which is worth our warm congratulations.
    In March of this year, Panchen Erdeni and I made a request to the State Council in Beijing for assistance in several construction matters in the Tibetan region. The State Council made corresponding decisions based on our request, including the construction of the highway from Lhasa to Shigatse. Only half a year has passed, and this highway is now open to traffic. Through this fact, it can be fully believed that in our great family of the motherland where all ethnic groups love and cooperate with each other, with the rapid development of various construction undertakings in the motherland, the various construction undertakings in the Tibetan region will develop rapidly, the backwardness of Tibet will be changed day by day, and the people's lives will gradually be improved and improved. This is beyond doubt.
    However, a happy life can only be achieved through the joint efforts of many people, overcoming many difficulties, and enduring much hardship. We should realize that the construction cause of Tibet has only just begun, and there is more and greater work waiting for us to do. Therefore, we must not be satisfied with the achievements we have already made; we must also work hard to further overcome difficulties. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, with the support and assistance of the people of all fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland, especially the Han people, and under the direct leadership and specific assistance of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC and the Tibet Military Region, all monks and lay people in Tibet, the People's Liberation Army in Tibet, and the Han workers in various places will unite closely, help each other, learn from each other, and continuously improve and improve their work, and strive to achieve greater achievements and build a prosperous and happy life in Tibet.

    西藏人民的又一件大喜事
    达赖喇嘛
    从拉萨到日喀则和从日喀则到江孜的两条公路已经通车了。这是继康藏、青藏两条公路同时通车拉萨之后，国务院帮助西藏地区进行建设事宜的又一重大成就。这再一次用事实证明了我们伟大祖国对少数民族地区建设事业的无比关怀和真诚帮助。值此庆祝拉日、日江公路通车之际，我们西藏全体僧俗人民，向伟大的中国共产党和我国各族人民的伟大的领袖毛泽东主席致以深切的衷心感谢。
    这两条公路的通车，大大便利了西藏内部的交通，把西藏的三大重要城镇连接起来了，密切了西藏内部各地区之间的联系，便利了我和班禅额尔德尼互相来往商谈工作，对进一步增强西藏内部的团结、促进西藏政治、经济、文化等建设事业的发展，有着重大的作用。这是西藏人民的又一件大喜事，也是祖国各族人民共同的喜事，值得我们热烈祝贺。
    今年三月间我和班禅额尔德尼在北京曾向国务院提出了请求帮助西藏地区进行建设的若干事项，国务院根据我们的请求，做出了相应的决定，其中就包括有修筑从拉萨到日喀则公路一项。距今仅只有半年时间，这条公路就通车了。通过这一事实，完全可以相信，在我们各民族友爱合作的祖国大家庭里，随着祖国各项建设事业的飞速发展，西藏地区的各项建设事业将会迅速发展起来，西藏的落后面貌将会日益改变，人民生活将会逐步得到提高和改善，这是不容置疑的。
    但是，幸福的生活是要经过许多人的共同努力，克服许多困难，忍受许多劳苦才能得来的，我们应该认识到，西藏的建设事业才仅仅开始，还有更多更大的工作等待我们去做。因此，我们决不能以现得的成就为满足；还必须努力工作，进一步克服困难，在中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，在祖国各兄弟民族人民特别是汉族人民的支援帮助下，在中共西藏工作委员会和西藏军区的直接领导和具体帮助下，西藏全体僧俗人民和进藏人民解放军以及在各地的汉族工作人员亲密团结，互相帮助、互相学习，不断改进和提高工作，为取得更大的成就，在西藏建设起繁荣幸福的生活而奋斗。　一九五五年十月十九日
