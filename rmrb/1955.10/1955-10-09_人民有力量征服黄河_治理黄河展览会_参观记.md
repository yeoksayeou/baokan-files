The People Have the Power to Conquer the Yellow River
-- A Visit to the "Yellow River Governance Exhibition"
Xiao He

The Yellow River, China's second largest river, is more than 4,800 kilometers long. In its more than 700,000 square kilometer basin, live over 180 million people of various ethnic groups. This is the birthplace of Chinese history and the cradle of its culture, and for a long time, it was the political and economic center of the country. Here there are over 650 million mu of cultivated land, accounting for 40 percent of the country's total cultivated land, and it is China's main production area for wheat, cotton, tobacco and other crops. Underground, there are also abundant reserves of coal, petroleum, iron, copper, aluminum and other minerals. The Yellow River water system itself is also an important resource. However, in the past, due to various limitations, the Yellow River was not only not well utilized, but also brought endless disasters and hardships to the people. For thousands of years, people have always been unable to avoid the disasters of the Yellow River, only hoping that one day a "sage" would appear to govern the Yellow River well. Now, after visiting the "Yellow River Governance Exhibition", people will proudly feel that the ancients' fantasies are about to become reality in our era.

	Turning a Harmful River into a Beneficial River

The exhibits of the Yellow River Governance Exhibition are displayed in two exhibition rooms of the Palace Museum. Many electric models, oil paintings, photographs, charts and books on river management vividly reflect the natural features of the Yellow River basin, the changes of the Yellow River, the history of Yellow River management, the great achievements of the people in Yellow River management and the prospects for comprehensive development of the Yellow River.

The guide pointed to the model and told us: In the past 3,000 years, the Yellow River has flooded and breached its banks more than 1,500 times, with 26 major course changes, including nine major diversions, inundating countless lives and property. We also saw on the model that there are dozens of red lines in a fan shape on the downstream plain of the Yellow River, which are the river courses where the fierce Yellow River water rushes in the vast area from Tianjin in the north to the Yangtze River in the south.

On another model, we first saw a panoramic view of the Yellow River with its turbulent yellow waves, and then a patch of green appeared in the middle section of the river, cutting off the Yellow River. The guide told us: This is the location of the Sanmenxia comprehensive project under construction. After the project is completed in six years, it will be possible to eliminate the floods in the lower reaches of the Yellow River for thousands of years, and it will also be possible to use floodwaters for power generation and irrigation. At this time, the Yellow River on the model has become half yellow and half green, and the river water below Sanmenxia has become completely clear. As the guide's stick moved, dozens of dams appeared on the Yellow River. Soon the entire Yellow River's turbid yellow water all turned into clear blue water. This is the scene when the entire long-term plan for Yellow River management is fully realized. At that time, the floodwaters stored by these dams can be used to generate 23 million kilowatts of electricity, with an average annual power generation of 110 billion kilowatt-hours, equivalent to ten times the total power generation in China in 1954. This electricity will fully supply emerging industrial and commercial cities and vast rural areas; the irrigation area can be expanded to more than 110 million mu of land, increasing grain production by more than 13 billion catties and cotton production by 1.2 billion catties each year; 3,000-ton freighters can travel directly from the coast to Zhengzhou, and 500-ton tugboats can reach Lanzhou directly. At that time, with the completion of soil and water conservation work, the barren northwest plateau will become a beautiful and rich area; the loess area in the middle reaches will also become a place with green mountains and clear waters, where people can live and work in peace and contentment forever; the dry climate in the Yellow River basin will also change, with the fragrance of plants and prosperous scenes everywhere.

	New Era, New Yellow River Management Policy

"Thousands of gullies and ravines transport sediment, and the turbulent muddy flow comes out of the gorges; erosion occurs above and siltation below, causing water and drought disasters to families." This folk song from the Yellow River basin illustrates the characteristics of the Yellow River's harm. Where does the turbulent muddy flow come from? On several diagrams, we saw that the water in the section of the Yellow River above Guide is relatively clear, but in the middle reaches, the water becomes yellow. In the loess plateau in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, due to loose soil, strong winds, and concentrated rainstorms, a large amount of soil and water is lost from the hills and ravines, and is carried into the Yellow River by various tributaries, making the Yellow River the river with the highest sediment content in the world. According to statistics, the Yellow River carries an average of 1.38 billion tons of sediment through Shanxian every year. If this sediment were carried to the sea by manpower, it would take 600 million laborers twelve years to carry it all. The river water rushes down, but it does not carry all the sediment away. Below Mengjin, the Yellow River enters the plain area, and 40 percent of the sediment is deposited in the riverbed. This causes the downstream riverbed to continuously rise, and it frequently breaches and changes course.

In ancient times, some people also made great efforts in managing the Yellow River, but because the policies were not correct, the problems were not fundamentally solved. The exhibition displays two cabinets of books on Yellow River management from past dynasties. One book contains a drawing of Yu the Great dredging the nine rivers during his water control efforts. In the Cangxian Nangong area of present-day Hebei Province, he dredged nine rivers side by side, trying to send the water and sediment downstream into the sea separately. Pan Jixun, a water control expert in the Ming Dynasty, also proposed the method of "building dikes to constrain the water and using water to attack the sand," advocating a single outflow into the sea. Whether "diverting" or "single outflow," these were basically "sending" methods that treated the symptoms rather than the root cause. The characteristics of the Yellow River are: high sediment content, sharp rises and falls in water level, and steep upper reaches with stable lower reaches. The water and sediment cannot be completely "sent" away. The "sending" policy cannot solve the fundamental problem.

People who have mastered modern science and technology do not advocate sending the water and sediment away, but rather controlling and utilizing them. In the Sanmenxia model, we can see that there are two stone islands in the heart of the river. In the past, water control experts of all dynasties regarded them as obstacles and wanted to remove them but could not. When Soviet experts—who had conquered the Volga and Don rivers—arrived, they regarded it as a treasure. This is the hardest rock, and on this rock, a large-scale hydroelectric power station that is rare in the world can be built. Our general policy for managing the Yellow River is to use water storage and sediment retention methods to achieve the goals of fundamental control and development.

The correct policy is a strong guarantee for the realization of our plan.

	For the People, Relying on the People

There are two oil paintings in the exhibition that sharply contrast the past and the present. One is a pre-liberation river dike, dilapidated, low and thin, with badger dens, fox burrows, trenches and bunkers everywhere in the dike body, wild animals coming in and out, and grass and trees completely cut down. This fully illustrates that the disasters of the Yellow River are inseparable from the crimes of the reactionary ruling class. Not only did they not repair the dikes, but they also did everything possible to destroy them, completely disregarding the lives and deaths of the people. What was particularly vicious was that Chiang Kai-shek breached the Huayuankou in 1938, causing more than 12 million people to suffer. The other is a post-liberation river dike returned to the hands of the people and repaired by the people. Trees are lined up on the dike, weeds are everywhere, and the dike body is neat, high and thick, defending against the raging flood. Now the dikes in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, which are more than 1,800 kilometers long, have been built like this, and the top of the dikes is generally 1.5 to 3 meters higher than the flood level that occurs once in a century. In order to protect the dike body, many large dams have also been built in the areas where the main current surges, and the past straw dams have almost all been replaced by stone dams. In a river section model, we saw the raging flood rushing directly towards the dike, which was truly worrying. However, the waves were pushed away just before they reached the dam, and they could not get close to the bank at all. Due to a series of flood control measures, the people have safely passed eight major floods since the Yellow River management, ensuring that no breaches have occurred. From 1946 to 1954, the total investment of the People's Government in the management of the Yellow River was equivalent to 33 times the Yellow River management funds during the 18 years from 1914 to 1932 during the reactionary rule. In the past few years, in addition to various repair and defense projects, large-scale hydrological surveys, drilling, surveying and planning and other fundamental preparatory work have been carried out; the trial promotion of soil and water conservation work has been carried out, and experience has been gained, laying the foundation for large-scale development of soil and water conservation work in the future; the Yellow River water diversion irrigation project has been built to open up the way to utilize the Yellow River water.

The farmers and Yellow River management workers along the river have made tremendous efforts in past work. Along the Yellow River dikes, 200,000 people are invested in the spring repair project every year, and there is also a flood control army composed of hundreds of thousands of volunteers in the rear. Every flood season, they are invested in the front line of flood control, fighting against the flood day and night. Here is a model of the Liu Zhuang rescue operation, which fully shows that this was a very thrilling battle: From August 2nd to 4th, 1953, the inner bank slopes in the Liu Zhuang section of Heze, Shandong collapsed and fell into the water everywhere, and some places had already been submerged, and the situation was very serious. Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the Yellow River workers and local people rushed to repair the dikes day and night. Farmers dozens of miles away waded through the mud overnight to deliver materials. When the carts got stuck, the people automatically carried more than 900,000 catties of materials to the construction site. The guide told us that after four or five days of fighting, they finally overcame the flood.

Many breaches in history were caused by hidden dangers, the so-called "a thousand-mile golden dike, collapsed in a single hole." In the past, it was believed that hidden dangers were impossible to solve. In order to eliminate hidden dangers and consolidate the dikes, Jin Zhao, a worker in the Fengqiu section of Henan, and some migrant workers in the Yuanyang section successively created the method of probing the dikes with steel cones. After large-scale cone probing in the past few years, the hidden dangers of the Yellow River dikes have been greatly reduced. During the 1949 flood, more than 400 loopholes appeared in various places. The 1954 flood was even larger than the 1949 flood, and only one loophole appeared in the entire river.

There is a "Stone of the Source of the River" in the exhibition, which was brought back by the staff who surveyed the source of the Yellow River. For a long time, people only said vaguely that the source of the Yellow River was north of the Bayan Har Mountains. No one knew where the Yellow River came from. In the past, some people had investigated it, and generally believed that Xingxiu Lake was the source of the river. In 1952, the river source survey team spent more than four months traveling more than 10,000 li in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and finally found that the real source of the Yellow River was the Yueguzonglie Canal in the northwest of the Bayan Har Mountains. The Yellow River's water volume is less than one-twentieth of the Yangtze River's water volume. It has now been discovered that the Kara Canal, a tributary of the Yellow River, and the Sewu Canal, a tributary of the Tongtian River in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, are only separated by a watershed ten kilometers wide, which provides a possibility for diverting the Yangtze River water into the Yellow River in the future.

The area of the source of the Yellow River is sparsely populated, and the survey work is very inconvenient. The local Tibetans have helped a lot with the survey work. From an oil painting in the second exhibition room, we can see the Tibetans' love for the motherland. They worked hard with the survey team, using yaks to help the survey team transport things. An old Tibetan man, Lamba Zhex, although very old, did not avoid hardships and led the way for the survey team, which played a great role in surveying the source of the Yellow River.

Visiting the Yellow River Management Exhibition is greatly inspiring and increases people's infinite strength. It makes people firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the assistance of advanced Soviet science and technology, the people have the power to conquer the Yellow River!

    人民有力量征服黄河
    ——“治理黄河展览会”参观记
    萧赫
    黄河，我国第二条大河，全长四千八百多公里。在它七十多万平方公里的流域面积内，居住着一亿八千多万各族人民。这里是我国历史的发源地和文化的摇篮，在一个长时期内是全国政治和经济的中心。这里共有耕地面积六亿五千多万亩，占全国耕地面积百分之四十，是我国小麦、棉花、烟叶等主要产地。地下并有丰富的煤、石油、铁、铜、铝和其他大量矿藏。黄河水系本身也是一项重要资源。但是，过去由于各种条件的限制，黄河不仅没有很好利用，反而带给人们无穷的灾难和困苦。几千年来，人们总是无法免除黄水的灾害，只是希望哪天能出一个“圣人”，把黄河治好。现在，当人们参观过“治理黄河展览会”，就会骄傲地感觉到：古人的幻想就要在我们这个时代变成事实了。
      变害河为利河
    治理黄河展览会的展览品陈列在故宫博物院的两个展览室内，很多的电动模型、油画、照片、图表和治河书籍，生动地反映了黄河流域的自然面貌，黄河的变迁情形，历代治黄情况，人民治黄的伟大成绩和综合开发黄河的远景。
    讲解员指着模型告诉我们：过去三千多年中，黄河共泛滥决口一千五百多次，其中重要改道二十六次，大改道九次，不知淹没了多少人民的生命和财产。我们从模型上也看到，黄河下游平原上有数十条红线作扇形分开，那就是凶猛的黄水在北起天津、南到长江的广大地区内横冲直撞的河道。
    在另一个模型上，我们首先看到黄涛滚滚的黄河全景，接着在河流中段出现一块绿色，截断了黄河。讲解员告诉我们：这就是正在筹建的三门峡综合性工程所在地，再过六年工程完成后，便可以把几千年来黄河下游的水灾免除，并能利用洪水发电和灌溉。这时模型上的黄河已成半截黄色半截绿色，三门峡以下的河水完全变清了。随着讲解员棒头的移动，在黄河上出现了数十座拦河坝，一会儿整个黄河混浊的黄水全都变成了清澈的碧流。这就是治理黄河远景计划全部实现时的情景。那时候，这些拦河坝所蓄洪水，将可用来发电二千三百万瓩，每年平均发电量达一千一百亿度，相当于一九五四年我国全部发电量的十倍，这些电力充分供应新兴的工商业城市和广大农村；可以把灌溉区域扩大到一亿一千多万亩土地，每年增产粮食一百三十多亿斤，棉花十二亿斤；三千吨大轮船可从海口直驶郑州，五百吨的拖船可直达兰州。那时候，随着水土保持工作的完成，土地贫瘠的西北高原，将变成美丽富饶的地区；中游黄土区域内，也将变得山青水秀，人民永远安居乐业；黄河流域干燥的气候也将改变，到处都是植物的清香，到处都是繁荣的景象。
      新的时代新的治河方针
    “千沟万壑输泥沙，滚滚浊流出山峡；上面冲刷下面淤，水旱灾害祸万家。”这首黄河流域的民谣，说明了黄河为害的特征。滚滚浊流从哪儿来的呢？在几张示意图上，我们看到黄河在贵德以上一段，水还比较清，到中游水就成了黄色。黄河中游的黄土高原，由于土松、风大、暴雨集中，丘陵沟壑水土便大量流失，由各支流带入黄河，使黄河成为世界上含沙最多的河流。据统计：黄河平均每年经过陕县的泥沙就有十三亿八千吨，这些泥沙如果用人工挑到海里，需要六亿个劳动力挑十二年才能挑完。河水奔腾直下，却没有把泥沙全部带走，到孟津以下，黄河进入平原地带，有百分之四十的泥沙就淤积在河道中了。这样，就使得下游的河床不断增高，并且经常决口改道。
    古代也有些人在治河中出了不少力气，但由于方针不对头，没有根本解决问题。展览会上陈列着两柜历代治黄的书籍，有一本书上绘有大禹治水时的疏九河图，他在现今河北省的沧县南宫一带并排疏了九条河，想分头把下游的水和泥沙输送入海。明代治水专家潘季驯，又提出“筑堤束水，以水攻沙”的办法，主张独流入海。不管“分流”还是“独流”，基本上都是一种头痛医头的“送”的办法。黄河的特点是：泥沙多、河水暴涨暴落、上游陡急下游平稳，水和泥沙是送不完的。“送”的方针不能解决根本问题。
    掌握了现代科学技术的人们，不主张把水和泥沙送走，而是要对它们加以控制、加以利用。在三门峡模型中，可以看到河心有两个石岛，过去历代治水者，都把它看成障碍，想去又去不掉。当苏联专家——曾经征服过伏尔加河、顿河的人们来到时，却把它当成一块宝贝。这是一种最坚硬的岩石，在这岩石上可以修起世界上少有的大型水电站。我们治理黄河的总方针，就是用蓄水拦沙的方法，达到根治和开发的目的。
    正确的方针是实现我们计划的有力保证。
    为了人民依靠人民
    展览会上有两幅油画，鲜明地对比了过去和现在。一幅是解放前的河堤，破破烂烂，又低又薄，堤身里獾洞狐穴、战壕碉堡到处皆是，野兽进进出出，草树砍伐殆尽，这充分说明黄河的灾害和反动统治阶级的罪恶是分不开的，他们不但不修堤，反而无所不至地破坏，根本不关心人民死活。尤其毒辣的是蒋介石，一九三八年扒开花园口，使一千二百多万人受到灾害。另一幅是解放后回到人民手中，经过人民整修的河堤，堤上树木成行，野草遍地，堤身整整齐齐，又高又厚，防御着汹涌的洪水。现在黄河下游长达一千八百多公里的大堤，都已修成这样，堤顶普遍比百年一遇的洪水位高出一公尺半到三公尺。为了保护堤身，在顶冲大溜的地方还修了很多大坝，过去的秸埽已几乎全部改为石坝。在一个河段模型里，我们看到滔滔洪水直向大堤扑去，形势真使人担心，可是，浪头刚到大坝前就被托开了，根本不得靠近堤岸。由于做了一系列的防洪工作，人民治黄以来已安渡八次大汛，保证了没有发生溃决。从一九四六年到一九五四年，人民政府对于治理黄河的总投资，相当于反动统治时期一九一四年到一九三二年十八年中治黄经费的三十三倍。几年来，除做了各种修防工程外，还进行了大规模水文测量、钻探、勘测规划等治本准备工作；试验推广水土保持工作，已取得经验，为今后大规模开展水土保持工作打下基础；兴修引黄灌溉济卫工程，开辟了利用黄水的道路。
    沿河农民和治黄工人在过去工作中作了巨大的努力。黄河大堤沿线，每年都有二十万人投入春修工程，后方还有几十万志愿组成的防汛大军，每到汛期便投入防洪前线，日夜同洪水搏斗。这里有一个刘庄抢险的模型，充分显示出这是一场十分惊险的战斗：一九五三年八月二日到四日两天中，山东菏泽刘庄地段内坝埽到处坍塌掉蛰，有的地方已平墩入水，情况非常严重。在党和人民政府领导下，黄河工人和当地群众日夜抢修，几十里外的农民?着泥泞连夜送料物，大车陷住了，群众就自动把九十多万斤料物背到工地。讲解员告诉我们，这次经过四、五天的战斗，终于战胜了洪水。
    历史上许多次决口，都是隐患造成的，所谓“千里金堤，溃于一穴”。过去认为隐患是没法解决的问题。为了消灭隐患，巩固大堤，河南封邱段工人靳钊和原阳段的一些民工先后创造钢锥锥探大堤的办法，几年来经过大规模锥探，黄河大堤隐患已大大减少。一九四九年洪水期间，各地曾出现了四百多个漏洞，一九五四年洪水比一九四九年更大，全河只出现一个漏洞。
    展览会上有一块“河源之石”，是勘测黄河河源的工作人员带回来的。很长时期里，人们都只是笼统地说黄河河源是在巴颜喀喇山以北，究竟黄河从那里来的，没人知道。以前也曾经有人调查过，一般也都认为星宿海是河源。一九五二年，河源调查队经过四个多月的时间，在黄河上游绕了一万多里的大圈子，最后找到了真正的黄河河源是在巴颜喀喇山西北的约古宗列渠。黄河水量还不到长江水量的二十分之一，现在发现的黄河支源喀喇渠和长江上游通天河的支流色吾渠只隔一条十公里宽的分水岭，这对将来引长江水入黄河提供了一个可能。
    黄河河源地带人烟稀少，勘测工作很不方便，当地藏民对查勘工作帮了很大的忙。从展览会第二室里一幅油画上可以看出藏民对祖国的热爱。他们和查勘队一起紧张地工作，用牦牛帮查勘队运输东西。老藏民兰巴哲西，虽然年纪很大，也不避艰苦地为查勘队带路，对勘测黄河河源起了很大作用。
    参观了治黄展览会，使人得到莫大的鼓舞，使人增加了无穷的力量。使人坚信：在共产党的领导下，在苏联先进科学技术的援助下，人民完全有力量征服黄河！
